Whoo!

What a cutie!
Beautiful!

19:26.791 --> 19:29.044
Oh, my gosh, I love you.
What is your name?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.963
My name is Rowan Grace.
I'm 16 years.

19:32.005 --> 19:35.592
What?! Oh, my God!
That's crazy!

19:35.633 --> 19:36.926
You know what?

19:36.968 --> 19:38.887
It's really hard to do
what you just did,

19:38.928 --> 19:41.723
and at 16 years old,
to channel that emotion,

19:41.765 --> 19:43.224
And I know you have
a lot of hormones

19:43.266 --> 19:45.018
and you got a lot of emotions
and all those things.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.770
But still to be able
to control it

19:46.811 --> 19:50.690
and to be dynamic and tender
and then get angry,

19:50.732 --> 19:52.359
you have to live
to be able to do that.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.818
'Cause now I turn around
and find out

19:53.860 --> 19:55.779
that you haven't even
lived your life yet,

19:55.820 --> 19:57.822
and you're that good.
I know. Thank you so much.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.617
I like your energy.
I like your outfit.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.911
Thank you!
I need to work with you.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.538
Come on, let's go.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.416
Ah!
Rowan, where are you from?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.168
I'm from Rapid City,
South Dakota.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.504
We don't get a lot
of South Dakotans in here.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.756
So I've heard.

Is that Dad over there?

20:16.633 --> 20:19.260
Yeah, my dad and my mom
and my grandma are here.
Hi, Mom. [ Laughs ]

20:19.302 --> 20:22.097
I love you. Mwah.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.473
They must be so proud.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.058
Is anybody else musical
in your family?

20:25.100 --> 20:27.018
My dad plays the drums.
Uh-huh.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.937
And when I grew up,
he was playing in bands.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.939
I did not take interest
in the drums.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.607
We had a drum kit
in our house, too.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.110
My dad played,
and my brother took the drums

20:35.151 --> 20:37.362
and I took the piano.
Yes, I play the piano, too.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.822
I do open mics.
Mm-hmm.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.782
I was actually
in a band last year.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.617
I did that.
[ Laughter ]

20:42.659 --> 20:45.286
I do write my own stuff.
I started writing when
I was probably 12.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.122
That stuff will never see
the light of day, for sure.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.250
Oh, my God. Mine won't either,
from that period.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.751
I also did musicals.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.920
I'm super into theater
and all that kind of stuff.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.131
I think all of those things
help you become

20:56.172 --> 20:58.216
a better storyteller
as a vocalist.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.136
And so much of
what we're looking for here

21:01.177 --> 21:03.304
is more than just
being a good singer.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.849
And I felt like you
really connected with the song,

21:05.890 --> 21:08.935
which made it easier for you
to connect with the audience.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.937
And the fact that you're 16
and doing that,

21:10.979 --> 21:13.982
that's not normal.
[ Laughter ]

21:14.024 --> 21:16.484
You know,
I love coaching artists

21:16.526 --> 21:19.571

already inside them.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.197
It would be so fun
to work with you.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.283
Thank you so much.
I appreciate that.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.161
Hey, Rowan!
Hi, Camila!

21:26.202 --> 21:29.164
Okay, she's singing
"Traitor," Olivia Rodrigo.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.999
I'm gonna guess
that she's a young,

21:31.041 --> 21:33.126
aspiring
singer-songwriter.

21:33.168 --> 21:37.130
And that makes me so excited
because I feel like

21:37.172 --> 21:39.507
I could really coach you
through the nerves

21:39.549 --> 21:43.636
and also finding out, you know,
what your specific lane is.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.847
What kind of music
do you want to sing?

21:45.889 --> 21:47.265
I like pop ballad stuff,

21:47.307 --> 21:49.225
but I also kind of like
more like indie pop.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.145
You remind me a lot of Olivia,
which is cool.
Oh, thank you.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.522
I would love for you
to pick me as your coach.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.983
I'm inspired by you.
Thank you so much.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.985
I also was gonna say
that I won "The Voice"

21:59.027 --> 22:02.364
with Carter Rubin,
who turned 15 on the show.

22:02.405 --> 22:05.575
And to watch him blossom
right before my eyes,

22:05.617 --> 22:07.285
it was just
a magical thing for me.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.828
Wow.

I'm the moron here that didn't
turn my chair around,

22:11.581 --> 22:13.833
but I am very excited
for you.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.670
So many times, we'll see
somebody that's 15, 16

22:16.711 --> 22:18.171
try out for this show,

22:18.213 --> 22:21.341

as far along as you are.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.326
"Alright, alright."
That got me really excited.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.286
I love that you're
representing our culture,

28:23.328 --> 28:26.331
and there's so much creativity
and excitement

28:26.373 --> 28:28.249
and so many things
to work within that.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.335
I think the reason
why I didn't turn around

28:30.377 --> 28:31.836
was because I'm looking
for something

28:31.878 --> 28:34.089
that gives it
a little bit of a -- a twist.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.091
Yeah.
What is gonna set you apart

28:36.132 --> 28:37.592
and make it different
as an artist?

28:37.634 --> 28:39.594
For example,
Rosalía started singing

28:39.636 --> 28:42.347
traditional
flamenco songs

28:42.389 --> 28:44.933
and then she came out
with "El Mal Querer,"

28:44.974 --> 28:46.601
which was flamenco mixed

28:46.643 --> 28:48.353
with these hip-hop,
rhythmic beats,

28:48.395 --> 28:51.940
and that is what set her apart
and made her Rosalía.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.401
And you can show that
in your cover choices.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.985
You have
a lot of potential,

28:56.027 --> 28:58.947
and I'm really proud of you
for representing us.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.615
Thank you so much, Camila.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.117
John:
That was really lovely.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.743
I think you have
a really beautiful tone.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.621
It felt like you were a little
bit not sure on your pitch.

29:06.663 --> 29:09.874
And so I was hesitant
to turn around.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.209
You have a gift.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.460
I think the execution
just could have been

29:12.502 --> 29:13.962
a little bit better.
Thank you so much.

29:14.004 --> 29:16.673
Thank you.
Hey, buddy.
I was a little bit lost.

29:16.715 --> 29:19.092
But your Spanish is
so good.
[ Laughs ]

29:19.134 --> 29:20.927
I obviously didn't know
the song,

29:20.969 --> 29:23.304
so I'm glad to hear all
the points Camila made.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.723
Makes sense now,
hearing her say it,

29:24.764 --> 29:26.474
but come back
and see us again.

29:26.516 --> 29:27.809
Yeah.
I definitely will.

29:27.851 --> 29:30.228
Thank you, guys, so much.
Thank you, Yelka.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.397
Camila:
With Yelka, I was intrigued,

29:32.439 --> 29:33.732
but I only have one spot left.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.234
Yelka, I'm so proud of you.
Muchas gracias.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.403
For the final spot,
I'm looking for somebody

29:38.445 --> 29:40.030
with that special sauce.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.157
Somebody who, within the first
few seconds, I'm like,

29:42.198 --> 29:44.200
"This is somebody different."

29:45.410 --> 29:47.078
I am Constance Howard.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.832
I'm 27 years old,
and I'm a teacher.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.667
I've always taught
fourth grade,

29:52.709 --> 29:55.462
and it's been
an amazing experience.

29:55.503 --> 29:59.174
* I'm gonna ace my test,
I'm gonna raise my score *

29:59.215 --> 30:02.927
I love being able to help
younger students

30:02.969 --> 30:04.846
and to see a light bulb go off

30:04.888 --> 30:06.681
when you teach them
something new.

30:06.723 --> 30:10.685
I found a way to kind of catch
my students' attention

30:10.727 --> 30:13.563
by motivating them through song.

30:13.605 --> 30:15.023
* School is my task *

30:15.065 --> 30:16.733
* Yeah *
* You can pass this test *

30:16.775 --> 30:18.568
* Yeah *
* Reading and the math *

30:18.610 --> 30:20.737
* Yeah *
* Education is that swag *

30:20.779 --> 30:23.990
* Can't nobody stop me
from learning *

30:24.032 --> 30:27.160
That was the first time
that I actually saw them

30:27.202 --> 30:30.955
excited to take that big test
at the end of the year.

30:31.915 --> 30:36.836
My students know that music
is something that I love to do,

30:36.878 --> 30:38.380
and they always ask,

30:38.421 --> 30:41.132
"Why aren't you a singer,
Ms. Howard?

30:41.174 --> 30:44.678
Why don't you go on 'The Voice',
Ms. Howard?" [ Laughs ]

30:44.719 --> 30:49.015
My mom is also a teacher,
and she encouraged me to go out

30:49.057 --> 30:53.478
for every solo at school,
every talent competition,

30:53.520 --> 30:56.731
and she really supported me
with my music.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.401
It's your moment.
It's your time to shine.

30:59.442 --> 31:02.278
You've worked hard
since you were 2 years old

31:02.320 --> 31:05.907
to get to this moment,
so we are super excited.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.283
Have fun.

31:07.325 --> 31:09.244
Alright, this is it.
I love you, guys.

31:09.285 --> 31:10.578
We love you.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.080
Constance:
For my blind audition,

31:12.122 --> 31:16.710
I am putting a twist on
"Peaches" by Justin Bieber

31:16.751 --> 31:19.754
featuring Daniel Caesar
and Giveon.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.924
My voice is unique,
because I have the ability

31:22.966 --> 31:26.428
to go up
into a very high register.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.388
Some people call it
whistle tones.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.640
It's my secret weapon.

31:30.682 --> 31:34.686
I'm super nervous,
because teams are filling up.

31:34.728 --> 31:37.689
This is like a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.775
You either get it right
or you flunk.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.069
And I don't plan on flunking.

31:43.111 --> 31:46.197
I am so ready for this moment.

Well, well, well.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.324
What is your name?

33:53.366 --> 33:54.993
My name is Constance Howard.

33:55.035 --> 33:57.912
I'm 27 years old,
and I'm from Katy, Texas.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.581
Constance,
that was so cool.

33:59.622 --> 34:01.750
Honestly, it was so creative
and different.

34:01.791 --> 34:04.794
You have so many incredible
places in your voice.

34:04.836 --> 34:06.296
Are you doing music
outside of this?

34:06.338 --> 34:07.881
You've got to be,
because it sounds like

34:07.922 --> 34:10.175
you would be an artist
that's signed already.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.510
I actually started off
in choir.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.179
I was a really shy student,

34:14.220 --> 34:16.931
and my parents
really motivated me

34:16.973 --> 34:19.351
and pushed me
to get in the studio

34:19.392 --> 34:21.686
and do more
stage performances at school.

34:21.728 --> 34:24.439
So it's been a journey.
Okay.

34:24.481 --> 34:27.192
You got a legend
and you got...

34:27.233 --> 34:28.401
Camila.
...Camila.

34:29.652 --> 34:31.529
Hi, Constance!
Hi, Camila!

34:31.571 --> 34:34.366
I have one more spot
left on my team,

34:34.407 --> 34:36.534
and I've been
really careful

34:36.576 --> 34:38.787
about who I pick
for this last spot.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.372
There is nobody else like you
on my team.

34:40.413 --> 34:42.374
I've been looking
for somebody like you

34:42.415 --> 34:45.085
that has that character voice,
that distinctiveness.

34:45.126 --> 34:46.920
You started off really shy,
right?

34:46.961 --> 34:48.338
Yes. My choir teacher,

34:48.380 --> 34:52.217
she's the one who got me
into hitting high notes.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.219
I didn't know
I could hit them.
Yeah.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.720
And she's like,
"You can go further.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.097
Just keep pushing yourself."

34:57.138 --> 34:58.765
That's the power
of a good teacher.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.600
Mm-hmm.
[ Cheers and applause ]

35:00.642 --> 35:04.020
That really resonates with me,
because I used to be so shy

35:04.062 --> 35:05.647
when I was younger.
What?

35:05.689 --> 35:07.065
Shut up. Liar!
I-I swear.
What?

35:07.107 --> 35:08.274
Come on.

35:08.316 --> 35:09.901
I never liked to sing
in front of people.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.319
I was so, so shy.

35:11.361 --> 35:13.863
And the first time
that I sang in front of people

35:13.905 --> 35:15.740
was on a singing competition
show.

35:15.782 --> 35:18.660
And I have come such
a long way from that.

35:18.702 --> 35:21.955
I mean, clearly,
Blake begs me to shut up

35:21.996 --> 35:23.623
in front of this crowd
all the time, 'cause I --

35:23.665 --> 35:26.001
In this moment,
I was thinking about it.
In this moment,

35:26.042 --> 35:28.712
he's like -- he's like, "When is
she gonna stop talking?"

35:28.753 --> 35:30.255
I really love
your tone of voice.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.965
I love working with artists
like you

35:32.007 --> 35:34.175
that have
a different quality of voice.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.011
That's just something
that God gave you, so...

35:36.052 --> 35:38.680
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

35:38.722 --> 35:40.932
So I would love
to be your coach.

35:40.974 --> 35:43.101
And I'm a pop girl, so...
I see.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.770
But I'm a pop girl with some
swag. Like, I'm not --

35:45.812 --> 35:47.731
You know what I mean?
I do think that, yes.

35:47.772 --> 35:49.149
Beat that, John.

35:50.942 --> 35:53.236

a lot about Camila.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.280
Oh, burn.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.782
In some ways
you reminded me of Rihanna,

35:57.824 --> 36:00.118
'cause Rihanna, I think,
does a really effective job

36:00.160 --> 36:01.661
of bringing,
like, Caribbean

36:01.703 --> 36:03.580
and African influence
into pop music.

36:03.621 --> 36:05.623
You just have such
a special voice,

36:05.665 --> 36:07.792
and then your chest voice
is so different

36:07.834 --> 36:09.210
from those whistle notes
that you're doing.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.129
I don't know if you listen
to Minnie Riperton, but...

36:11.171 --> 36:12.922
I love Minnie Riperton.
[ Laughs ]

36:12.964 --> 36:15.216
Yeah, well, she was like
the queen of, like,

36:15.258 --> 36:18.178
the soulful whistle notes
back in the day.

36:18.219 --> 36:20.597
And you'll be able to take
any song,

36:20.638 --> 36:22.098
like you
just took this Bieber song,

36:22.140 --> 36:24.309
and really made it
your own.

36:24.351 --> 36:27.103
And I feel like the fun part
of working with you would be

36:27.145 --> 36:29.356
just finding
other songs that you could take

36:29.397 --> 36:30.690
and just transform them.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.067
Every coach on here
could say,

36:32.108 --> 36:33.735
"You don't sound
like anybody on my team,"

36:33.777 --> 36:35.278
'cause you don't sound
like anybody on the show.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.155
I don't know if I've ever heard
anyone that sounded

36:37.197 --> 36:39.908
exactly like you do, and I would
love to work with you --

36:39.949 --> 36:41.368
help you pick songs,
help you figure out

36:41.409 --> 36:44.245
how to channel that into
a really successful time

36:44.287 --> 36:45.622
on this show.

36:45.663 --> 36:48.333
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

I didn't hit my button.

36:52.796 --> 36:53.963
I have one spot left.

36:54.005 --> 36:56.549
But you hit
a couple of notes

36:56.591 --> 36:59.344
in that song
that defies science.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.179
[ Laughter ]

37:01.221 --> 37:03.348
But I think I've --
That Blake can't even
hear anymore

37:03.390 --> 37:05.767
with his hearing.
Temporarily paralyzed
from those notes.

37:05.809 --> 37:08.645
It's almost like
my ears never heard

37:08.687 --> 37:10.605
something
that high before.

37:10.647 --> 37:12.440
[ Laughter ]
But also,

37:12.482 --> 37:14.150
when I saw these two
turn around, I was like,

37:14.192 --> 37:15.860
"You know what?
This is --"
You were like,

37:15.902 --> 37:17.821
"You know what? Constance
should go with Camila."

37:17.862 --> 37:19.197
That's what I was thinking.
I was like,

37:19.239 --> 37:21.199
"Oh, my God, it's like
a match made in heaven."

37:21.241 --> 37:23.868
We would make a great pair.

sounded like

from the original,

My team is full,
and I'm devastated,

56:41.026 --> 56:42.944
because I love
that song so much.

56:42.986 --> 56:45.447
And I don't understand
why do you even know that song?

56:45.488 --> 56:48.616
My mom, my beautiful mother.
I love your mom!

56:48.658 --> 56:51.703
I was literally
just growing up with '50s,

56:51.745 --> 56:53.163
'60s, '70s.
Ask Blake --

56:53.204 --> 56:55.290
one of my favorite bands --
I know every Bread song.

56:55.331 --> 56:58.043
Honestly, that was so beautiful.
Sorry I couldn't press.

56:58.084 --> 56:59.919
Congratulations
on being great.

56:59.961 --> 57:01.296
Thank you, Gwen, so much.

57:01.338 --> 57:03.465
Some of my coolest
team members honestly

57:03.506 --> 57:05.175
have come
from Washington State.

57:05.216 --> 57:07.093
I live in a really cool spot.
It's called Woodinville,

57:07.135 --> 57:09.804
and there's literally like --
Oh, I play at that
Chateau summer show, yeah.

57:09.846 --> 57:12.432
I was gonna open for you, man,
but you didn't choose me, dude.

57:12.474 --> 57:14.100
Wow.

57:14.142 --> 57:15.935
Oh! Wha-oh!

57:15.977 --> 57:17.437
Why don't you pick him,
John?

57:17.479 --> 57:18.938
If you could have picked him,
why didn't you pick him?

57:18.980 --> 57:20.690
I -- Honestly,
I didn't know.

57:20.732 --> 57:22.817
I mean, are you about -- Don't
tell me that you didn't know.

57:22.859 --> 57:24.778
I didn't see him.
Oh, come on.

57:24.819 --> 57:26.821
And then I actually had
some of my "Voice" artists

57:26.863 --> 57:30.158
who were from that area
come up and sing with me.

57:30.200 --> 57:32.369
Whatever's happening up there,
I feel like the scene

57:32.410 --> 57:35.747
is really conducive to creative,
interesting artists.

57:35.789 --> 57:37.665
And you are certainly that.

57:37.707 --> 57:41.086
Everything that you did
just created this vibe

57:41.127 --> 57:43.505
that was transcendent
and mesmerizing.

57:43.546 --> 57:46.341
Just know that I love
bringing my team members up

57:46.383 --> 57:48.343
on stage to sing
with me.

57:48.385 --> 57:51.763
This is something that could
happen if you join my team.

57:51.805 --> 57:55.058
[ Laughter ]
Ohh!

57:55.100 --> 57:59.104
I am so mad
that my team is full,

57:59.145 --> 58:00.897
'cause your voice
is so special.

58:00.939 --> 58:03.942
My first thought was,
"I'm gonna steal this guy, too."

58:03.983 --> 58:06.361
But hearing you talk
about '50s and '60s and '70s,

58:06.403 --> 58:08.738
and then Gwen was like,
"Oh, my God! I love that song!"

58:08.780 --> 58:11.199
I was like,
"Gwen should steal you first.

58:11.241 --> 58:14.411
And if she can't,
I'll save you, baby."

58:14.452 --> 58:15.829
Thanks for saying, baby.

58:15.870 --> 58:17.872
I-I might have been
singing it for you, so...

58:17.914 --> 58:21.251
Gwen: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

58:21.292 --> 58:22.961
Ooh.
What is happening?

58:23.003 --> 58:25.088
Wow, Jaeden.
Ooh.

58:25.130 --> 58:27.382
Jaeden, you're making
my whole day.

58:27.424 --> 58:29.551
Jaeden.

58:29.592 --> 58:31.553
He is swiping right
right now.

58:31.594 --> 58:33.513
Ohh.
Thanks, Jaeden.

58:33.555 --> 58:36.725
You're so cute and talented,
and I like your style.

58:36.766 --> 58:38.977
Thank you.
[ Laughs ]

58:39.019 --> 58:40.854
Whoo!
[ Laughs ]

58:40.895 --> 58:44.232
Hi, Jaeden. One thing that we
haven't talked about yet

58:44.274 --> 58:46.609
is that bad-ass mullet

58:46.651 --> 58:49.988
that you just drug up
on the stage, man.
[ Laughs ]

58:50.030 --> 58:51.781
That's hot.
Yeah.

58:51.823 --> 58:53.199
Thank you so much.

58:53.241 --> 58:54.826
And just as much
as I love your voice,

58:54.868 --> 58:57.996
I love your direction
a-as an artist in that music.

58:58.038 --> 59:00.874
Gwen's not kidding.
We listen to Bread all the time.

59:00.915 --> 59:03.084
I'd rather listen
to that stuff than --

59:03.126 --> 59:04.919
Than me?
No, I love you.

59:04.961 --> 59:06.254
And I need your help
right now.

59:06.296 --> 59:08.173
[ Laughs ]
I love your music so much.

59:08.214 --> 59:09.591
[ Laughter ]

59:09.632 --> 59:11.718
And thank God
for Camila.

59:11.760 --> 59:15.430
Camila has single-handedly
saved music, as we know it.

59:15.472 --> 59:17.891
[ Laughter ]
I have one spot left
on my team.

59:17.932 --> 59:21.144
You could be the person
who completes me.

59:21.186 --> 59:22.645
I would be honored
for you

59:22.687 --> 59:24.647
to be the last person
on my team, man.

59:24.689 --> 59:25.690
Let's do this.

59:25.732 --> 59:27.275
Let's do it for Bread!
Come on, man!

59:27.317 --> 59:28.610
Let's do this!

59:28.651 --> 59:30.528
Jaeden, who do you pick
as your coach?

59:30.570 --> 59:32.072
Uh...
Yeah, come on.

59:32.113 --> 59:35.116
Who's he gonna pick?
Who's he gonna pick?
I don't know!

59:35.158 --> 59:37.452
This is so hard.
I never should've known you!

59:37.494 --> 59:40.789
I never fired you.
John fired you.

59:40.830 --> 59:43.416
I love you all so much.
Thank you for everything.

59:43.458 --> 59:45.960
And I just want to thank
my beautiful mom and sister

59:46.002 --> 59:48.296
who are here, too.
Gwen: Aww!

59:48.338 --> 59:50.340
That's sweet.

59:51.174 --> 59:52.467
But...

59:53.677 --> 59:55.970
T-The finger convinced me,
man, I gotta --

59:56.012 --> 59:58.556
Yes! Jaeden!
* Don't wanna scoot the boots
with nobody *

59:58.598 --> 1:00:00.558
You gotta start
doing the finger.

1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:04.104
* Get straight tequila drunk
on nobody *

1:00:04.145 --> 1:00:05.480
Blake:
I'll tell you what, man.

1:00:05.522 --> 1:00:08.358
Jaeden confirmed it --
I had him at the finger.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:11.486
Tell me that you can ever say
no to this.

1:00:11.528 --> 1:00:12.904
Could you say no to this?

1:00:12.946 --> 1:00:15.907
Could you ever say no to this?
I don't think so.

1:00:15.949 --> 1:00:17.409
Yes!

1:00:17.450 --> 1:00:19.703
* Don't wanna scoot the boots
with nobody *

1:00:19.744 --> 1:00:22.706
Daly: So forget Team Blake,
let's talk about flirting

1:00:22.747 --> 1:00:24.165
with Camila Cabello.
[ Laughter ]

1:00:24.207 --> 1:00:25.542
That was so fun to watch.

1:00:25.583 --> 1:00:26.960
That was hilarious.
So happy for you, man.

1:00:27.002 --> 1:00:28.169
You sounded great.

1:00:28.211 --> 1:00:29.337
Thank you, Jaeden.

1:00:29.379 --> 1:00:32.340
My team is full! Yes!

1:00:32.382 --> 1:00:34.342
[ Cheers and applause ]
So happy that Jaeden

1:00:34.384 --> 1:00:36.428
actually literally completed
my team

1:00:36.469 --> 1:00:39.389
as far as every genre
that I'm into.

1:00:39.431 --> 1:00:43.184
I got a duo,
I got pop, I got country,

1:00:43.226 --> 1:00:45.729
I got folk,
I got some rock on there,

1:00:45.770 --> 1:00:47.981
and because of him,
I've got one of those guys

1:00:48.023 --> 1:00:50.900
that does some of that throwback
'70s-sounding pop that I love.

1:00:50.942 --> 1:00:53.153
Team Blake is unbelievable
this year.

1:00:53.194 --> 1:00:54.821
The finger convinced him.

1:00:54.863 --> 1:00:55.822
[ Laughter ]

1:00:55.864 --> 1:00:57.866
Nobody can say no to that,
right?

1:00:57.907 --> 1:00:59.034
[ Laughter ]

1:00:59.075 --> 1:01:00.452
Looks like a worm.

1:01:08.626 --> 1:01:09.794
* This is "The Voice" *

1:01:09.836 --> 1:01:11.713
Daly:
Welcome back to "The Voice".

1:01:11.755 --> 1:01:13.757
**

1:01:13.798 --> 1:01:15.842
Nia: I feel like there's
a-a little pressure,

1:01:15.884 --> 1:01:19.095
because the teams
are filling up.

1:01:19.137 --> 1:01:21.639
For a really long time,
I didn't quite believe

1:01:21.681 --> 1:01:25.810
that I was capable
of even getting this far.

1:01:25.852 --> 1:01:27.937
Just being here has proven to me

1:01:27.979 --> 1:01:29.939
that if you believe
in yourself hard enough,

1:01:29.981 --> 1:01:32.442
you can really
just do anything.

1:01:32.484 --> 1:01:37.364
**

1:01:43.870 --> 1:01:45.080
Mm-hmm.

1:01:45.121 --> 1:01:48.917
My grandmother was
a huge inspiration for me

1:01:48.958 --> 1:01:50.251
when it came to singing.

1:01:50.293 --> 1:01:52.003
She bought me a karaoke machine.

1:01:52.045 --> 1:01:53.546
She's like,
"Learn all these songs

1:01:53.588 --> 1:01:55.298
and you're gonna
be a great singer."

1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:57.342
I was a really shy kid
growing up,

1:01:57.384 --> 1:01:59.386
so she would bribe me
with money.

1:01:59.427 --> 1:02:01.096
She'd be like,
"I'll give you five bucks

1:02:01.137 --> 1:02:02.305
if you sing right now."

1:02:02.347 --> 1:02:03.723
And I'm like...

1:02:03.765 --> 1:02:05.183
It's like, "Fine, 20."

1:02:05.225 --> 1:02:06.559
And I was like, "Alright,
now we're talking.

1:02:06.601 --> 1:02:08.812
Let's do it."
I'm proud of you.

1:02:14.776 --> 1:02:16.486
For my blind audition,

1:02:16.528 --> 1:02:19.531
I am singing "Bam Bam"
by Camila Cabello

1:02:19.572 --> 1:02:20.990
featuring Ed Sheeran.

1:02:21.032 --> 1:02:23.868
I really admire Camila,
being Cuban

1:02:23.910 --> 1:02:25.537
and also being a female artist

1:02:25.578 --> 1:02:30.166
and being a crossover artist
is extremely hard.

1:02:30.208 --> 1:02:33.545
I hope I do the song justice.
I hope she likes it, honestly.

1:02:33.586 --> 1:02:36.548
I've worked really hard to get
to this moment.

1:02:36.589 --> 1:02:40.010
I've been taking music
very, very seriously.

1:02:40.051 --> 1:02:43.847
I am a singer-songwriter,
currently a deejay.

1:02:43.888 --> 1:02:47.600
And I'm always in studio
sessions bettering my craft.

1:02:47.642 --> 1:02:53.231
I love to just give people
light and energy.

1:02:53.273 --> 1:02:54.816
This is my time.

1:02:54.858 --> 1:03:00.905
I've never felt this sure
or ready about anything, ever.

1:03:00.947 --> 1:03:04.784
So I'm really,
really excited to do this.

1:03:07.996 --> 1:03:09.748
**

1:03:09.789 --> 1:03:11.374
Oh, my God.
This is my song.

1:03:11.416 --> 1:03:14.377

but you're surfin' now *

and it knocked me down *
Come on, John. You gotta go.

Thank you so much.
I love you!

Can I give you a hug?

she's so cute!

You're so beautiful.

Oh, my God.
Can I hug you, please?

Of course you can.

Oh, my God.
Of course you can.

What is life? Oh, my gosh.
You sang your hat off.

Whoo! I did.

1:05:13.163 --> 1:05:15.623

Wait. What's your name?

1:05:18.918 --> 1:05:21.379
I am from...
* Havana, ooh, na-na *

1:05:21.421 --> 1:05:24.591
What?

1:05:24.632 --> 1:05:25.925
Nia,
I have to tell you.

1:05:25.967 --> 1:05:27.844
My team
is completely full,

1:05:27.886 --> 1:05:29.804
so I couldn't
turn around for you.

1:05:29.846 --> 1:05:31.931
I forgive you. [ Laughs ]

1:05:31.973 --> 1:05:35.268
No. I love your personality.
You're so fun and funny.

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:36.728
Thank you.

1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:38.563
I'm getting, like,
star power right now.

1:05:38.605 --> 1:05:40.065
Super.
Oh, my goodness.

1:05:40.106 --> 1:05:42.233
Like, I feel like there's
singers and then there's,

1:05:42.275 --> 1:05:43.860
like, star energy.

1:05:43.902 --> 1:05:45.111
You're so comfortable
on stage,

1:05:45.153 --> 1:05:46.863
you have amazing style.
Thank you.

1:05:46.905 --> 1:05:48.865
You're adorable.

1:05:48.907 --> 1:05:50.492
You were interacting
with the crowd.

1:05:50.533 --> 1:05:53.411
You were like, "Hey, come on,
pónganle azúcar, mi gente,"

1:05:53.453 --> 1:05:55.914
like, you know, that is what
I love about our culture,

1:05:55.955 --> 1:05:58.750
what I love about our people,
what I love about our music.

1:05:58.792 --> 1:06:00.543
And I really like
your energy.

1:06:00.585 --> 1:06:03.922
That's gonna make people
fall in love with you.
Thank you so much.

1:06:03.963 --> 1:06:05.256
That's the first time
somebody sang

1:06:05.298 --> 1:06:07.967
one of my songs
in the blinds,

1:06:08.009 --> 1:06:09.260
so that was
really, really cool.

1:06:09.302 --> 1:06:11.471
How cool is that?
Such a great feeling.

1:06:11.513 --> 1:06:14.307
That was also the first time
Blake has heard any of my songs.

1:06:14.349 --> 1:06:15.809
Wow.
[ Laughter ]

1:06:15.850 --> 1:06:17.352
I literally -- I looked over,
and I was like,

1:06:17.394 --> 1:06:18.853
"She knows every word
of this song."

1:06:18.895 --> 1:06:20.146
I said,
"Do you know this song?"

1:06:20.188 --> 1:06:22.315
She goes, "It's my song."
Oh, my God.

1:06:22.357 --> 1:06:25.860
I was just happy he wasn't like,
"This song sucks, right?"

1:06:25.902 --> 1:06:27.362
I was like, "Aww, I really hope
John picks her.

1:06:27.404 --> 1:06:29.489
He's the only person that can
pick anybody right now."

1:06:29.531 --> 1:06:32.200
I mean, I hope I can steal you
from him at one point,

1:06:32.242 --> 1:06:33.618
because I love you.

1:06:33.660 --> 1:06:36.913
I don't know, Camila, 'cause you
know my boy, John, here.

1:06:36.955 --> 1:06:38.623
Hey!
Hey!

1:06:38.665 --> 1:06:39.874
[ Laughter ]

1:06:39.916 --> 1:06:43.128
Hey! [ Laughs ]

1:06:43.169 --> 1:06:44.963
Well, Nia,
welcome to Team Legend.

1:06:45.005 --> 1:06:47.799
I'm very excited to have you.
Thank you.

1:06:47.841 --> 1:06:50.051
And I had to check
with Camila,

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:51.970
because she couldn't
turn for you.

1:06:52.012 --> 1:06:53.304
And I know
you would have picked her...

1:06:53.346 --> 1:06:54.848
I would -- I would have turned
for you.

1:06:54.889 --> 1:06:56.224
...if she was able
to turn for you.

1:06:56.266 --> 1:06:58.977
But I looked over
at her and said,

1:06:59.019 --> 1:07:01.312
"Do you approve of me
pushing my button?"

1:07:01.354 --> 1:07:04.149
[ Laughs ]
And I was like,
"She's fiery, she's fiery."

1:07:04.190 --> 1:07:05.650
[ Laughter ]
Do it, do it.

1:07:05.692 --> 1:07:08.570
I am so excited, because I think
you have so much charisma...

1:07:08.611 --> 1:07:10.655
Yeah, so much charisma.
...so much energy
in your voice.

1:07:10.697 --> 1:07:12.198
Thank you.
It really cuts through,

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:14.451
and it just feels celebratory
and fun.

1:07:14.492 --> 1:07:18.788
You are the last person to make
it on to Season 22

1:07:18.830 --> 1:07:20.790
of "The Voice",
congratulations.

1:07:20.832 --> 1:07:21.916
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:07:21.958 --> 1:07:23.501
* All she wanna do is dance *

1:07:23.543 --> 1:07:24.961
Thank you!
* All I wanna do
is get up on her *

1:07:25.003 --> 1:07:27.547
And, Nia,
I want to welcome you

1:07:27.589 --> 1:07:28.882
to Team Legend.
Oh!

1:07:28.923 --> 1:07:30.258
* All I wanna touch
is her nirvana *

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:32.010
* Feels like I've been
waitin' for *

1:07:32.052 --> 1:07:33.636
* Forever and a night
to get this chance *

1:07:33.678 --> 1:07:36.056
John: Team Legend
is a super team.

1:07:36.097 --> 1:07:38.016
I'm so proud of my artists.

1:07:38.058 --> 1:07:39.893
They're diverse.
They're powerful.

1:07:39.934 --> 1:07:41.978
We've got soul music.
We've got rock.

1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:44.022
We've got pop.
We've got country.

1:07:44.064 --> 1:07:47.400
We've got Latin music.
Such amazing, talented artists.

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:49.986
Some of the best artists that
I've come across on this show

1:07:50.028 --> 1:07:51.613
are on my team this season.

1:07:51.654 --> 1:07:53.865
I can't wait to get to work
with my team in the battles.

1:07:53.907 --> 1:07:55.325
We're gonna have so much fun.

1:07:55.367 --> 1:07:58.328
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:07:58.370 --> 1:08:00.538
the blinds are complete.

The blinds are over, but the
battles are about to begin.

But first, here's the
performance of our coaches

1:08:17.764 --> 1:08:19.808
doing "Havana".

* There's somethin'
'bout his manners, yeah *

* He didn't walk up with that,
"How you doin'?" *

1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:10.150
* When he came
in the room *

1:09:10.191 --> 1:09:12.610
* He said there's a lot of girls
I can do with *

1:09:12.652 --> 1:09:14.195

without you *

what I can learn.

First day of battles.
First day of battles.

First day of battles.
Are you ready for this?

1:11:53.813 --> 1:11:55.482
I'm excited.
This is the hard part, though,

1:11:55.523 --> 1:11:57.484
because now you fought
for these people

1:11:57.525 --> 1:11:58.902
to be on your team...
I know.

1:11:58.943 --> 1:12:00.445
...and then you're gonna
tell them to go home.

1:12:00.487 --> 1:12:01.696
I know. It's gonna be
really, really hard.

1:12:01.738 --> 1:12:03.531
Yeah.
But I'm also excited.

1:12:03.573 --> 1:12:04.949
Like, I know what
my battles look like,

1:12:04.991 --> 1:12:07.952
and I'm excited to show it off
to you guys.

1:12:07.994 --> 1:12:09.454
And I don't think
it's gonna hit me

1:12:09.496 --> 1:12:10.914
till we're actually there.

1:12:10.955 --> 1:12:14.125
That one of them has to go home,
and I can only pick one.

1:12:14.167 --> 1:12:15.293
You know, when you were
on that other

1:12:15.335 --> 1:12:16.961
singing competition show?
Yeah.

1:12:17.003 --> 1:12:18.963
I remember it well.
You get to be the bad guy now.

1:12:19.005 --> 1:12:21.508
I know. I have the power now.
Is that exciting to you,

1:12:21.549 --> 1:12:23.009
or do you feel bad
about it?
Uh...

1:12:23.051 --> 1:12:25.220
Because you're making
someone's life...
I know.

1:12:25.261 --> 1:12:26.721
...and you're ruining
another person's life.

1:12:26.763 --> 1:12:28.848
With great power comes
great responsibility.

1:12:28.890 --> 1:12:30.600

the "Gremlins", isn't it?

You look good.

I had today.
Come here.

in country music, he's
the CMA New Artist of the Year.

1:12:58.670 --> 1:13:00.964
He can relate to these people
who are still right there

1:13:01.006 --> 1:13:03.049
on the edge
of -- of having their moment.

1:13:03.091 --> 1:13:05.176
Have you ever tried out
for something like this

1:13:05.218 --> 1:13:06.511
along the way?
Yeah, I've tried out

1:13:06.553 --> 1:13:08.179
for "The Voice" twice.
What'd they tell you?

1:13:08.221 --> 1:13:11.141
"Unh-unh." [ Laughs ]

1:13:11.182 --> 1:13:12.684
My bass player, Tate,
did it

1:13:12.726 --> 1:13:14.686
and made it
farther than I did.
[ Laughs ]

1:13:14.728 --> 1:13:15.979
[ Laughs ]

1:13:16.021 --> 1:13:17.856
When I first heard Blake
wanted to bring me on,

1:13:17.897 --> 1:13:20.358
I was like, "Man, how much
is he charging me?" [ Laughs ]

1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:22.402
But it's very rewarding
to give back,

1:13:22.444 --> 1:13:25.030
because I still see myself
as a new artist.

1:13:25.071 --> 1:13:28.199
I've always wanted to come see
what I can learn

1:13:28.241 --> 1:13:29.701
from what you're telling
these artists.

1:13:29.743 --> 1:13:32.287
Your brains are gonna be
blown into the toilet...

1:13:32.328 --> 1:13:34.164
Yeah, nice.
...and the toilet's
gonna flush itself.

1:13:34.205 --> 1:13:35.373
A self-flushable toilet?
Yeah.

1:13:35.415 --> 1:13:36.541
Where you buy those at?

1:13:36.583 --> 1:13:37.959
Get them from
thevoice.com?

1:13:38.001 --> 1:13:40.128
[ Laughter ]

1:13:40.170 --> 1:13:41.838
Oh, yeah.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.840
This should be
an interesting pairing.

1:13:43.882 --> 1:13:45.592
This kid, Austin, is 19,

1:13:45.633 --> 1:13:48.970
but he does old-school,
traditional country music,

1:13:49.012 --> 1:13:52.182
and he's just, like,
from another dimension.

1:13:52.223 --> 1:13:55.101
And then Tanner came out and
auditioned with Travis Tritt.

1:13:55.143 --> 1:13:56.603
But then he sounded
so good,

1:13:56.644 --> 1:13:58.938
you know, it's like,
"I gotta go in with this."

1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:00.273
Jimmie: What's up?

1:14:00.315 --> 1:14:01.608
Hey, hey, hey.
How's it going?

1:14:01.649 --> 1:14:04.027
He's even got, like,
a Kix Brooks shirt on.

1:14:04.069 --> 1:14:05.945
Look at that.
Jimmie: Big belt buckle.

1:14:05.987 --> 1:14:07.739
I got it at a garage sale.
No way, man.

1:14:07.781 --> 1:14:09.282
Nice to meet you, dude.
This is Jimmie Allen.

1:14:09.324 --> 1:14:10.825
I'm Jimmie.
Nice to meet you, man.

1:14:10.867 --> 1:14:12.494
Tanner: The adviser for
Team Blake is Jimmie Allen.

1:14:12.535 --> 1:14:14.412
He also moved to Nashville
right around the same age

1:14:14.454 --> 1:14:15.747
that I am right now.

1:14:15.789 --> 1:14:17.457
And he's doing massive things.

1:14:17.499 --> 1:14:19.668
You know, he's got number ones.
Everybody knows who this guy is.

1:14:19.709 --> 1:14:21.586
So it's super inspirational.

1:14:21.628 --> 1:14:23.880
Your voices
are -- are really different.

1:14:23.922 --> 1:14:26.049
I would rather sing with someone
that sounded nothing like me

1:14:26.091 --> 1:14:28.093
so that way people could tell
when I'm singing.

1:14:28.134 --> 1:14:29.636
I did a single
with Garth.

1:14:29.678 --> 1:14:32.389
I tried to be him
my whole life growing up.

1:14:32.430 --> 1:14:34.224
So then when we were on a record
together, he's like,

1:14:34.265 --> 1:14:35.767
"Man, we really
had a hard time

1:14:35.809 --> 1:14:37.769
being sure that people knew
which one was which,"

1:14:37.811 --> 1:14:39.813
and without him saying...
Yeah.

1:14:39.854 --> 1:14:42.148
...you're copying me,
you know?
Yeah. [ Laughs ]

1:14:42.190 --> 1:14:43.775
Before every time you sing,
you should be like,

1:14:43.817 --> 1:14:46.611
"This is Blake."
[ Laughter ]

1:14:46.653 --> 1:14:48.446
Alright, well, let's hear
some of this, then.

1:14:48.488 --> 1:14:50.323
Blake: Austin and Tanner
both kind of have this

1:14:50.365 --> 1:14:51.866
vintage thing about them.

1:14:51.908 --> 1:14:55.704
So I gave them "Folsom Prison
Blues" by Johnny Cash.

1:14:55.745 --> 1:14:59.666
* I hear
the train a-comin' *
Whoa.

1:14:59.708 --> 1:15:02.836
* It's rolling
'round the bend *

1:15:02.877 --> 1:15:04.838
There couldn't have been
a better song pick.

1:15:04.879 --> 1:15:06.589
I love this song.

1:15:06.631 --> 1:15:08.466
* I'm stuck in
Folsom prison *

1:15:08.508 --> 1:15:10.343
It's about a guy who didn't
listen to his mom,

1:15:10.385 --> 1:15:11.886
and ended up going to prison.
[ Laughs ]

1:15:11.928 --> 1:15:15.640
* And time keeps draggin' on *
Yeah.

1:15:15.682 --> 1:15:18.351
I've always just had
morbid stage fright.

1:15:18.393 --> 1:15:21.521
I don't remember anything
from that first performance.

1:15:21.563 --> 1:15:23.815
My mom and my dad both,
any opportunity I get,

1:15:23.857 --> 1:15:25.525
they've always just pushed me,

1:15:25.567 --> 1:15:27.152
and I know they're
the only reason

1:15:27.193 --> 1:15:28.653
I've broken out of my shell.

1:15:28.695 --> 1:15:32.157
* When I was just a baby,
my mama told me, "Son" *

1:15:32.198 --> 1:15:33.742
* What'd she say, boy? *

1:15:33.783 --> 1:15:35.577
* "Always be a good boy" *
Tanner: I've been pursuing music

1:15:35.618 --> 1:15:37.037
for the past 10 years now.

1:15:37.078 --> 1:15:38.496
My grandparents were the ones
that introduced me

1:15:38.538 --> 1:15:39.873
to Johnny Cash.

1:15:39.914 --> 1:15:41.332
They would always want me
to get out my guitar

1:15:41.374 --> 1:15:42.500
and play it for them.

1:15:42.542 --> 1:15:44.127
I can see my mom
and Nanny dancing around

1:15:44.169 --> 1:15:46.129
and clapping the whole time
that I would be playing the song

1:15:46.171 --> 1:15:47.922
and working on kind of getting
that deep end

1:15:47.964 --> 1:15:49.841
of my voice rounded out.

1:15:49.883 --> 1:15:53.178
* Now, when I hear
that whistle blowin' *

1:15:53.219 --> 1:15:56.681
* I hang my head and I cry *

1:15:56.723 --> 1:15:58.683
Why are we here?
I don't know.

1:15:58.725 --> 1:16:00.518
[ Laughter ]
Honestly, you guys are great.

1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:02.687
You guys need to step it up,
okay?

1:16:02.729 --> 1:16:04.522
[ Laughter ]
These guys killed it.

1:16:04.564 --> 1:16:06.441
I'm glad I'm not
singing against y'all.

1:16:06.483 --> 1:16:08.693
You can tell y'all definitely
have put time in

1:16:08.735 --> 1:16:12.238
with your own individual craft
as musicians.

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:13.740
That's cool to see.
Thank you.

1:16:13.782 --> 1:16:15.200
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

1:16:15.241 --> 1:16:17.660
Tanner, your voice does have
a natural grit to it,

1:16:17.702 --> 1:16:19.204
and it's so good
the times

1:16:19.245 --> 1:16:20.997
when you're singing
in the lower register

1:16:21.039 --> 1:16:23.875
and you purposely put
that [growls] thing in there.

1:16:23.917 --> 1:16:25.335
You don't have to do that...
Don't have to, yeah.

1:16:25.377 --> 1:16:26.628
...because it's already
in there.

1:16:26.670 --> 1:16:28.505
And for you, man,
I think physically,

1:16:28.546 --> 1:16:31.716
body language-wise,
loosen up as much as you can...
Okay, okay.

1:16:31.758 --> 1:16:33.051
...you know,
just have fun with it.

1:16:33.093 --> 1:16:34.761
Show that smile some more, bro.
Alright.

1:16:34.803 --> 1:16:36.805
Even when you're singing,
man, you're, like, you know,

1:16:36.846 --> 1:16:38.139
show it.

1:16:38.181 --> 1:16:39.516
What I like about Austin's
voice, it's a little bit

1:16:39.557 --> 1:16:42.811
smoother, very bluesy,
early country,

1:16:42.852 --> 1:16:44.771
but it has, like, kind of like
a lighter tone to it.

1:16:44.813 --> 1:16:46.231
* Freed me
from this prison *

1:16:46.272 --> 1:16:48.108
* If that old railroad train
was mine *

1:16:48.149 --> 1:16:49.734
Jimmie: I like Tanner, man.

1:16:49.776 --> 1:16:51.569
He's definitely got
that Southern rock vibe.

1:16:51.611 --> 1:16:54.155
* Folsom prison *
Austin: I definitely need
to step up my game,

1:16:54.197 --> 1:16:57.659
especially since Tanner has been
in the business 10 years or so.

1:16:57.701 --> 1:16:59.244
One of the big things
I'm trying to work on

1:16:59.285 --> 1:17:01.788
is getting a little bit
of a yodel thrown in there,

1:17:01.830 --> 1:17:05.000
'cause that's almost like
a lost art in country music.

1:17:05.041 --> 1:17:07.085
* Away *

1:17:07.127 --> 1:17:08.920
10! A 10.

1:17:08.962 --> 1:17:10.338
10!
Thank you very much.

1:17:10.380 --> 1:17:11.923
That was -- You just dial it
back just enough, man.

1:17:11.965 --> 1:17:13.425
Just enough? Good.
It was really good, yeah.

1:17:13.466 --> 1:17:14.718
Perfect, thanks you, yeah.

1:17:14.759 --> 1:17:16.094
Tanner: To work with Blake
and Jimmie,

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:18.138
two of the biggest names
in country right now,

1:17:18.179 --> 1:17:21.307
it -- it means more than
I could really say, you know,

1:17:21.349 --> 1:17:23.643
and the experiences that they've
been through and the knowledge

1:17:23.685 --> 1:17:27.272
that they've accrued
through their entire career,

1:17:27.313 --> 1:17:28.815
I mean, it's priceless.

1:17:28.857 --> 1:17:30.191
Jimmie: The challenge I would
give you guys --

1:17:30.233 --> 1:17:32.110
start to put together
what you want

1:17:32.152 --> 1:17:33.820
your life and your career
to look like,

1:17:33.862 --> 1:17:35.363
the type of music
you want to make,

1:17:35.405 --> 1:17:36.781
the team you want around you.

1:17:36.823 --> 1:17:38.283
Yeah, thank you, yeah.
Great advise.
Perfect.

1:17:38.324 --> 1:17:40.076
Y'all leave, go put your feet
in the pool.

1:17:40.118 --> 1:17:41.703
[ Laughter ]

1:17:41.745 --> 1:17:44.456
I'd fly in to watch
them guys sing.

1:17:44.497 --> 1:17:45.874
Man, that's how good it was.

1:17:45.915 --> 1:17:47.917
And also, I want to fly in
to see Blake's face

1:17:47.959 --> 1:17:50.211
trying to make a decision.
[ Laughs ]

1:17:50.253 --> 1:17:52.464
See ya in the ring.
Y'all still do that
with the ring thing?

1:17:52.505 --> 1:17:53.965
Yeah.
Now that's dope.

1:17:54.007 --> 1:17:55.967
And whoever loses gets thrown
to the alligators.

1:17:56.009 --> 1:17:57.594
It's definitely gonna be
one of the toughest decisions

1:17:57.635 --> 1:17:59.304
I have to make this season,

1:17:59.346 --> 1:18:02.724
because this is gonna come
down to who I believe the most.

1:18:09.898 --> 1:18:11.232
* This is "The Voice" *

1:18:11.274 --> 1:18:13.234
Daly:
Welcome back to the battles.

1:18:13.276 --> 1:18:14.736
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:18:14.778 --> 1:18:17.614
Two talented singers battle now
from Team Blake.

1:18:17.655 --> 1:18:19.074
Let's do it, man.
Let's do this, man.

1:18:19.115 --> 1:18:21.576
I've never experienced
this before.

1:18:21.618 --> 1:18:22.744
It's exciting.
It's crazy.

1:18:22.786 --> 1:18:24.871
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:18:24.913 --> 1:18:28.625
Yeah.
This battle begins right now.

1:18:30.752 --> 1:18:34.506
**

1:18:34.547 --> 1:18:38.677
* I hear
the train a-comin' *

1:18:38.718 --> 1:18:44.015
* It's rolling
'round that bend *

1:18:44.057 --> 1:18:51.272
* And I ain't seen the sunshine
since I don't know when *

1:18:51.314 --> 1:18:56.444
* I'm stuck
in Folsom prison, baby *

1:18:56.486 --> 1:19:01.366
* Time keeps draggin' on *

1:19:01.408 --> 1:19:03.284
Alright!
Wow.

1:19:03.326 --> 1:19:08.623
* But that train
keeps a-rollin' *

1:19:08.665 --> 1:19:13.753
* On down to San Antone *

1:19:13.795 --> 1:19:16.715
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:19:16.756 --> 1:19:19.092
* When I was just
a baby *

1:19:19.134 --> 1:19:21.761
* My mama told me, "Son" *
* What's she say, boy? *

1:19:21.803 --> 1:19:23.805
* "Always be a good boy" *

1:19:23.847 --> 1:19:25.890
* "Don't wanna see you
play with guns" *

1:19:25.932 --> 1:19:28.351
* But I shot a man
in Reno *

1:19:28.393 --> 1:19:32.397
* Just to watch him die *
So good.

* I hang my head
and I cry *

1:19:40.822 --> 1:19:42.365
Tell 'em about it.

1:19:43.199 --> 1:19:45.660
* Well, I bet there's
rich folks eating *

1:19:45.702 --> 1:19:48.038
* In a fancy dining car *

1:19:48.079 --> 1:19:52.000
* They're probably drinkin'
coffee and smoking big cigars *

1:19:52.042 --> 1:19:54.461
* Well, I know
I had it coming *

1:19:54.502 --> 1:19:55.795
* Oh, I know *

1:19:55.837 --> 1:19:59.049
* I can't be free *

1:20:01.009 --> 1:20:03.678
* But those people keep
a-movin' *

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:04.888
* And that's what *

1:20:04.929 --> 1:20:08.475
* Tortures me *

1:20:09.309 --> 1:20:12.020
* Well, if they freed me
from this prison *

1:20:12.062 --> 1:20:14.564
* If that old railroad train
was mine *

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:16.024
* I bet I'd move it on *

1:20:16.066 --> 1:20:18.860
* A little farther
down the line *

1:20:18.902 --> 1:20:20.862
* Far from Folsom prison *

1:20:20.904 --> 1:20:25.784
* Oh, that's where
I long to stay *

1:20:26.910 --> 1:20:30.538
* And I'd let
that lonesome whistle *

1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:34.042
* Blow my blues away *

1:20:34.084 --> 1:20:35.543
What?! Oh, my gosh!

1:20:35.585 --> 1:20:39.130
* You know, I'd let
that lonesome whistle *

1:20:39.172 --> 1:20:44.969
* Blow my blues away *

1:20:45.011 --> 1:20:45.970

* Lonesome whistle *

1:20:48.098 --> 1:20:54.562

Oh, my God.
That was amazing!

1:20:58.274 --> 1:20:59.734
Let's go!

1:20:59.776 --> 1:21:01.778
Let's go! So good!

1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:04.781
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:21:04.823 --> 1:21:06.574
Oh, man.

1:21:06.616 --> 1:21:08.326
Oh, my gosh. What the...

1:21:08.368 --> 1:21:11.079
Holy shiitake mushrooms!

1:21:11.121 --> 1:21:13.581
That was amazing!
That was incredible.

1:21:13.623 --> 1:21:14.916
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:21:14.958 --> 1:21:17.377
That was like
an awards show performance.

1:21:17.419 --> 1:21:20.422
It was so fun to watch.
That was pretty good, man.

1:21:20.463 --> 1:21:23.383
I'll be honest,
I'm not familiar with this song.

1:21:23.425 --> 1:21:25.176
Like, at first, I was like,
"Oh, this is cool."

1:21:25.218 --> 1:21:28.346
And then I was like...
[ Laughs ]

1:21:28.388 --> 1:21:31.057
Austin, I'm curious,
because you're 19,

1:21:31.099 --> 1:21:33.476
did you always have
that performance thing

1:21:33.518 --> 1:21:35.645
when you were like you
did the shot

1:21:35.687 --> 1:21:37.272
with the guitar
and the cigar?

1:21:37.313 --> 1:21:39.024
I've only been --
This is my like

1:21:39.065 --> 1:21:40.775
fifth or sixth
live performance.

1:21:40.817 --> 1:21:42.986
You're joking.
I've gotten all this training,
like, recently.

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:45.113
[ Cheers and applause ]
What on Earth?

1:21:45.155 --> 1:21:48.533
You guys are both
great performers.

1:21:48.575 --> 1:21:52.620
As far as who you should pick
to win this battle,

1:21:52.662 --> 1:21:54.330
I don't really know.

1:21:54.372 --> 1:21:57.250
After all that, you're not gonna
pick somebody?

1:21:57.292 --> 1:21:58.335
[ Laughter ]

1:21:58.376 --> 1:22:00.003
That wasn't
leading up to anything?

1:22:00.045 --> 1:22:01.296
I gotta think about it.

1:22:01.338 --> 1:22:02.922
Well, take your time.
Just take your time.

1:22:02.964 --> 1:22:04.466
I'll tell you
tomorrow morning.

1:22:04.507 --> 1:22:05.800
Okay.
[ Laughter ]

1:22:05.842 --> 1:22:08.928
I was absolutely blown away
by that performance.

1:22:08.970 --> 1:22:10.513
I don't know
if people realize

1:22:10.555 --> 1:22:12.807
that a character style
like this is --

1:22:12.849 --> 1:22:14.267
it's so hard to do.

1:22:14.309 --> 1:22:15.727
It felt like
I was back in time.

1:22:15.769 --> 1:22:18.063
Even she knows that that was
a good version of a song

1:22:18.104 --> 1:22:21.191
that she doesn't know.
I know. Yeah.

1:22:21.232 --> 1:22:24.652
Austin, you did some rock star
yelling kind of thing.

1:22:24.694 --> 1:22:26.237
I can't believe it.

1:22:26.279 --> 1:22:28.156
Thank you.
Like, I'm just like,
"Wow," that was --

1:22:28.198 --> 1:22:29.366
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1:22:29.407 --> 1:22:30.784
It was so good.
I appreciate that.

1:22:30.825 --> 1:22:32.327
And, Tanner, same thing.

1:22:32.369 --> 1:22:34.329
I mean,
your voice was perfection.

1:22:34.371 --> 1:22:37.749
What blows me away is the fact
that Austin is so young.

1:22:37.791 --> 1:22:40.168
I'd probably be more curious
to see what Austin's gonna do,

1:22:40.210 --> 1:22:42.629
but you guys are both
so good.

1:22:42.671 --> 1:22:44.172
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:22:44.214 --> 1:22:46.883
John: Guys,
that was phenomenal.

1:22:46.925 --> 1:22:49.094
We don't stand
for everybody that performs.

1:22:49.135 --> 1:22:51.388
Blake never stands up,
and it's his team.

1:22:51.429 --> 1:22:53.807
He's tired.
It physically hurts.

1:22:53.848 --> 1:22:55.058
[ Laughter ]

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:56.518
Austin is younger.

1:22:56.559 --> 1:22:58.228
The fact that you're
so committed to your craft

1:22:58.269 --> 1:23:00.021
and so naturally good
at it

1:23:00.063 --> 1:23:01.690
means
you have a lot of potential.

1:23:01.731 --> 1:23:05.360
And then, Tanner, the second you
entered the song, it was like,

1:23:05.402 --> 1:23:07.362
"Whoa, I'm in a whole
nother world."

1:23:07.404 --> 1:23:11.241
It felt so real and authentic,
I would pick Tanner.

1:23:11.282 --> 1:23:14.160
Thank you.
Thank you, Coaches.

1:23:14.202 --> 1:23:15.495
Alright, Blake, give us
some thoughts first

1:23:15.537 --> 1:23:17.205
and then tell us
who won the battle.

1:23:17.247 --> 1:23:18.915
Blake: You know, this pairing
to me, I thought,

1:23:18.957 --> 1:23:21.543
"Well, this is gonna be weird,
because they're so different."

1:23:21.584 --> 1:23:24.045
Tanner has a tendency
to go into the growl,

1:23:24.087 --> 1:23:26.673
where Austin keeps his tone
a little cleaner.

1:23:26.715 --> 1:23:30.427
And one of my notes was clean up
t-the gravelly a little bit.

1:23:30.468 --> 1:23:32.554
And, Austin,
maybe you could lean in

1:23:32.595 --> 1:23:34.681
to maybe
a little rougher edge.
Mm-hmm.

1:23:34.723 --> 1:23:38.018
And it was cool to hear Gwen
saying you did make it go there.

1:23:38.059 --> 1:23:40.603
This is one of those
that's just tough, guys.

1:23:40.645 --> 1:23:43.273
Blake, who's the winner
of this battle?

1:23:43.314 --> 1:23:47.193
There's -- There's two ways
to go here,

1:23:47.235 --> 1:23:48.486
and they're both right.

1:23:48.528 --> 1:23:50.030
Yeah, they're both right.
Yeah.

1:23:50.071 --> 1:23:53.950
**

1:23:53.992 --> 1:23:55.952
But I think I've made
my choice here.

1:23:55.994 --> 1:23:58.747
**

1:23:58.788 --> 1:24:01.249
The winner
of this battle is...

1:24:06.087 --> 1:24:15.847
**

1:24:15.889 --> 1:24:25.690
**

1:24:25.732 --> 1:24:35.533
**
