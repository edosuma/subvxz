00:20.021 --> 00:21.454
(Man coughs)

00:22.623 --> 00:25.659
Buddy, I'm gonna have
to ask you to move along.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.799
(Sighs)

00:46.246 --> 00:48.514
Hey there!

00:48.548 --> 00:51.884
Excuse me?

00:53.821 --> 00:57.890
This is a restricted area.

01:00.427 --> 01:02.695
Ma'am?

01:02.729 --> 01:06.598
Ma'am?

01:06.633 --> 01:08.367
Are you all right?

01:18.910 --> 01:22.312
(Castle) We should go
somewhere relaxing, you know,

01:22.346 --> 01:24.214
where we can just hang, don't you think?

01:24.248 --> 01:25.448
Before we plan the honeymoon,

01:25.483 --> 01:27.918
- shouldn't we set a wedding date first?
- No.

01:27.952 --> 01:29.019
'Cause the department hasn't even said

01:29.053 --> 01:30.821
if you can have time off yet.

01:30.855 --> 01:33.556
Besides, planning a honeymoon
will help us set a date.

01:33.591 --> 01:36.059
(Mouth full) Okay. I can't
wait to hear about this.

01:36.094 --> 01:37.127
What, you don't want to go to Thailand

01:37.161 --> 01:38.595
during monsoon season, do you?

01:38.629 --> 01:40.096
Or New Zealand in the winter?

01:40.131 --> 01:42.999
No. You decide where you wanna go,

01:43.033 --> 01:44.700
the best time to be there.

01:44.735 --> 01:46.302
Boom. Lobby for those dates.

01:46.337 --> 01:47.403
New Zealand?

01:47.438 --> 01:49.672
Castle, are you using our honeymoon

01:49.706 --> 01:52.242
as an excuse to go and tour middle-earth?

01:52.276 --> 01:54.076
(Whispers) I'm game if you are.

01:54.111 --> 01:55.911
I was hoping for something more romantic

01:55.946 --> 01:57.446
and less hobbit-y.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.848
Why does everyone always think

01:58.882 --> 02:00.415
- those two are mutually exclusive?
- And it should be a place

02:00.450 --> 02:01.583
that neither of us have ever been to.

02:01.618 --> 02:03.953
Agreed. A perfect spot that will be ours

02:03.987 --> 02:06.022
- and ours alone.
- Like Barcelona.

02:06.056 --> 02:07.023
That's where I took Meredith.

02:07.057 --> 02:09.991
Okay. Um...

02:10.026 --> 02:12.227
GalÃ¡pagos... I've
always wanted to go there.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.629
- Gina.
- Seriously?

02:13.663 --> 02:15.964
Yeah, part of our whirlwind honeymoon tour.

02:15.998 --> 02:18.033
Fine. Swiss alps. I hear
they're breathtaking.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.268
- They are.
- No.

02:19.302 --> 02:21.236
Yeah. That's where, uh,
Meredith and I used to winter.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.737
You know what? I think a better plan

02:22.772 --> 02:24.506
would be for you to make a list
of all the places in the world

02:24.541 --> 02:27.008
that you've never honeymooned, vacationed,

02:27.043 --> 02:28.877
or married any of your other wives.

02:28.911 --> 02:30.611
How hard could it be?

02:30.646 --> 02:33.648
Albania and Finland...
that's all you've got left.

02:33.683 --> 02:34.883
Well, we traveled a lot.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.551
Well, I'm sure I can
think of some other places.

02:36.585 --> 02:38.987
- Yeah, well, my vote's for someplace warmer.
- Ah, maybe you're right.

02:39.021 --> 02:42.724
Maybe we should just...
focus on setting a date.

02:42.758 --> 02:44.492
(Police radio chatter)

02:44.526 --> 02:45.826
Hey, Ryan.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.596
(Siren wailing in distance)

02:48.630 --> 02:49.863
What's going on with Lanie?

02:49.898 --> 02:51.699
Uh, this case just hit
a little close to home.

02:51.733 --> 02:52.766
Why? What happened?

02:52.801 --> 02:55.069
A security guard on the night shift

02:55.103 --> 02:57.871
found the victim hanging from that beam.

02:57.906 --> 03:00.174
We I.D.'d her as Pam Hodges, 32.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.942
Hanging, as in, by the neck?

03:01.976 --> 03:06.080
Yeah. But what's really bizarre
is the way the victim looks.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.683
Whoa!

03:09.718 --> 03:10.918
Is that Lanie's sister?

03:10.952 --> 03:12.619
Lanie doesn't have a sister.

03:13.688 --> 03:16.023
- Are Pam Hodges and Lanie related?
- (Lanie) Nope.

03:16.057 --> 03:17.890
But they say we all have
a twin out there somewhere.

03:17.925 --> 03:19.526
I guess this one's mine.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.862
- Lanie, we can deal with the preliminaries later.
- I was shook up at first,

03:22.896 --> 03:25.599
but I'm fine now. She died
between 2:00 and 4:00 A.M.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.501
Her neck did not break because
the killer rigged the wires

03:28.536 --> 03:29.802
so her feet were just off the ground.

03:29.837 --> 03:31.471
She probably was strangled to death.

03:31.505 --> 03:33.505
How does a wire that thin not snap?

03:33.540 --> 03:34.607
It's high-test fishing line,

03:34.641 --> 03:36.042
available at most sporting goods stores.

03:36.076 --> 03:37.777
So then... it would have seemed

03:37.811 --> 03:40.412
like she was just
standing there on the dock.

03:40.447 --> 03:41.948
That's how she looked when we rolled up.

03:41.982 --> 03:43.515
It was freaky.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.317
It's what her killer was going for.

03:45.352 --> 03:48.554
He put her body on display
to create a tableau.

03:48.588 --> 03:50.122
He's confident... brazen.

03:50.156 --> 03:52.057
Yeah, like he'd done it before?

03:52.091 --> 03:53.592
Contact the FBI.

03:53.627 --> 03:56.161
See if they have any similar
murders in their databases.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.297
- Do we have any witnesses?
- No, not so far.

03:58.331 --> 03:59.698
Security guard had rousted a homeless guy

03:59.733 --> 04:01.032
before he found the victim.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.534
Uniforms are still
trying to track him down,

04:02.569 --> 04:04.836
- see if he saw anything.
- What do we know about Pam Hodges?

04:04.871 --> 04:06.938
She's from Tampa, Florida,
where she lived on the fringes,

04:06.973 --> 04:09.674
racked up about a half a
dozen busts for solicitation.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.342
This is her about a year ago.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.443
I'd say she came up in the world.

04:12.478 --> 04:13.711
She looks a heck of a lot better now

04:13.746 --> 04:14.813
than she did back then...

04:14.847 --> 04:16.815
aside from the being-dead part.

04:16.849 --> 04:18.649
- Why was she in New York?
- Don't know yet.

04:18.684 --> 04:20.317
She moved here seven months ago.

04:20.351 --> 04:22.420
- New York driver's license with a Brooklyn address.
- All right.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.255
Check her address, see if
she's got any family here.

04:24.290 --> 04:26.624
Yes, Pam's my niece.

04:26.659 --> 04:27.992
She stayed at my place for a few weeks

04:28.026 --> 04:29.560
when she moved to the city.

04:29.595 --> 04:31.496
Do you know why she
came to town, Mr. Hodges?

04:31.530 --> 04:33.498
Well, she said she needed a fresh start

04:33.532 --> 04:36.534
- and she had a job offer.
- Doing what?

04:36.568 --> 04:39.603
I was afraid Pam would start
working the streets again.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.371
She burned a lot of bridges
by telling the family

04:41.406 --> 04:43.740
she would go straight and never doing it.

04:43.775 --> 04:45.042
But this time was different.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.744
Pam moved out of my house
when she said she would.

04:47.779 --> 04:49.613
She started working a job.

04:49.647 --> 04:51.882
A few months back, I met her for lunch.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.284
And I almost didn't recognize her,

04:53.318 --> 04:56.052
she looked so good. Pam was happy.

04:56.086 --> 04:58.722
She said this new job
was just what she needed.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.357
What do you know about this job?

05:00.391 --> 05:02.592
- Where did she work?
- She wouldn't talk about it much,

05:02.627 --> 05:04.027
except to say that it was legit

05:04.061 --> 05:06.262
and that she was being taken care of.

05:06.297 --> 05:08.565
Do you know where she moved
to after she left your place?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.634
Well, she and I shared a cab that day,

05:10.668 --> 05:12.235
and it dropped her off at a building

05:12.269 --> 05:14.637
off the West Side highway.

05:14.671 --> 05:18.507
I'll tell you this...
Pam took a big step up.

05:21.078 --> 05:23.813
(Scoffs) A big step up?

05:23.848 --> 05:25.815
<i>This is a giant leap.</i>

05:25.850 --> 05:29.151
This is a... this is a
vault into the stratosphere.

05:29.185 --> 05:32.421
How does a former streetwalker from Tampa

05:32.456 --> 05:34.423
afford a place like this?

05:34.458 --> 05:36.258
She ever get any visitors?

05:36.292 --> 05:39.829
- Possible that she, uh, worked out of the home?
- No, sir.

05:39.863 --> 05:41.464
<i>That is not possible.</i>

05:41.498 --> 05:43.131
Well, then who paid for rent?

05:43.166 --> 05:47.769
Detective, we have a well-earned
reputation for discretion...

05:47.803 --> 05:49.571
and guarding the privacy of our clients.

05:49.605 --> 05:51.473
Privacy ends when murder begins.

05:51.507 --> 05:53.842
Now I want the name of whoever
is paying for this unit.

05:53.877 --> 05:57.913
And if you don't have that, then go get it.

05:57.947 --> 05:59.514
(Sighs)

05:59.548 --> 06:01.716
- I love when you get angry.
- (Sighs)

06:01.751 --> 06:03.451
I mean, at other people, besides me.

06:03.486 --> 06:05.420
Castle, look at these coats.

06:05.454 --> 06:07.856
There's at least 20 grand hanging here.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.492
So whoever was paying her
rent bought her wardrobe, too.

06:10.526 --> 06:14.796
These coats, this insane
place, her history as a hooker,

06:14.830 --> 06:17.665
and now this job where
she's well taken care of?

06:17.700 --> 06:18.799
All points to one thing.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.701
She was someone's mistress.

06:20.735 --> 06:22.236
And her sugar daddy hasn't come forward

06:22.271 --> 06:24.571
<i>or reported her missing. At the very least,</i>

06:24.606 --> 06:25.639
- he knows about her life.
- (Cell phone beeps)

06:25.673 --> 06:27.374
At the very most, he's the one who took it.

06:27.456 --> 06:28.789
If Pam was a kept woman,

06:28.824 --> 06:31.425
then he's been to this apartment.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.461
I'm gonna get ahold of C.S.U.,
have them sweep for prints

06:33.495 --> 06:34.729
so we can find out who's been here.

06:34.763 --> 06:36.530
While we're at it, we should take a look

06:36.565 --> 06:37.765
and see what's on this.

06:37.799 --> 06:39.400
She might have taken a picture of him.

06:39.434 --> 06:41.034
(Keyboard keys clicking) (Tory)
It doesn't look like she did.

06:41.069 --> 06:43.671
These are mostly standard
tourist snapshots of New York.

06:43.705 --> 06:46.807
No pictures of people, friends, boyfriends?

06:46.842 --> 06:49.243
I haven't found any so far.

06:49.277 --> 06:51.044
(Beckett) Keep looking, okay?

06:51.079 --> 06:52.812
And check the faces in the background,

06:52.847 --> 06:53.914
see if any of them show up again.

06:53.948 --> 06:55.682
Those photos might be our best bet.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.784
- Thanks.
- (Keys continue clicking)

06:57.818 --> 06:59.486
I take it this means we hit a wall

06:59.520 --> 07:00.720
on who rents the apartment?

07:00.755 --> 07:03.323
The lease is held and
paid for by Gregs-Baker,

07:03.358 --> 07:06.193
which is a shell corporation
based out of Belize,

07:06.227 --> 07:09.161
and it was set up in such a
way as to make it untraceable.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.730
All right, well, what about
phone records and credit cards?

07:10.765 --> 07:12.999
It must point to who Pam
Hodges was spending time with.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.601
She barely used her phone.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.770
<i>And even though she racked
up huge credit card bills,</i>

07:16.804 --> 07:20.640
it was mostly for shoes
and clothes and hair salons.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.443
And it was paid for
monthly by Gregs-Baker.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.777
Well, what did C.S.U.
find at her apartment?

07:24.811 --> 07:26.779
Her prints. No one else's.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.547
- What the hell is going on here?
- I don't know.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.117
(Cell phone buzzing) But someone
is doing an incredible job

07:31.151 --> 07:33.185
of covering their tracks. (Beeps)

07:33.220 --> 07:34.186
Hey, Lanie.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.055
Kate...

07:36.089 --> 07:37.623
I need you to get down here.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.657
Okay, we're on our way.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.126
Not Castle. Just you.

07:45.264 --> 07:46.465
Hey, what's going on?

07:46.499 --> 07:50.235
Pam Hodges recently had
cheek implants put in.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.539
It made her face broader, like mine.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.474
- Okay.
- Her hair products,

07:55.508 --> 07:57.475
her lipstick, her nail polish...

07:57.509 --> 07:59.244
they're all the same as the ones I use.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.612
Lanie, you're just picking
up on things that are similar

08:01.647 --> 08:03.949
- with the victim.
- That's what I kept telling myself.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.150
Then I found this.

08:09.588 --> 08:11.622
Okay, all right. I've seen this before.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.391
It... it means "inner strength."

08:13.426 --> 08:15.493
I know what it means, Kate.

08:15.527 --> 08:16.694
Look.

08:18.363 --> 08:21.899
I have the same exact
tattoo in the same place.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.835
How's that even possible?

08:23.869 --> 08:25.937
It's no accident we could be twins.

08:25.971 --> 08:29.239
Somebody went out of their
way to make her look like me.

08:35.413 --> 08:41.166
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

08:47.364 --> 08:48.599
(Esposito) Wait a minute. So you're saying

08:48.609 --> 08:50.594
that Pam Hodges was
trying to look like Lanie?

08:50.627 --> 08:51.800
Given the tattoo and the surgery,

08:51.835 --> 08:53.335
I just don't see another explanation.

08:53.369 --> 08:55.537
Yeah, but why would she do that?

08:55.571 --> 08:57.005
Because her sugar daddy wanted her to.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.474
Maybe he found her down in Tampa,

08:59.509 --> 09:02.477
shipped her up here, set her up in style.

09:02.512 --> 09:03.912
I mean, to a streetwalker,
that would seem like

09:03.946 --> 09:05.547
the greatest gig ever,
and all she'd have to do

09:05.581 --> 09:09.184
is let him remake her into Lanie.

09:09.218 --> 09:11.085
Yeah, like Jimmy Stewart in "Vertigo."

09:11.119 --> 09:13.320
- Thanks, L.T.
- Yeah, but even more twisted.

09:13.355 --> 09:15.356
So this guy has to know Lanie.

09:15.390 --> 09:16.591
Only she doesn't seem to know him.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.259
But she's still coming
in to give us a statement.

09:18.293 --> 09:20.327
Now, what about the
staff in Pam's building?

09:20.362 --> 09:22.196
Did they give us any more details?

09:22.230 --> 09:24.699
No, none of them remember seeing
any guys coming to see her.

09:24.733 --> 09:25.934
You know, there might be another way

09:25.968 --> 09:27.868
for us to trace this guy.

09:27.902 --> 09:30.104
The cheek implants have serial numbers.

09:30.138 --> 09:32.506
Maybe that'll lead us to Pam's surgeon.

09:32.541 --> 09:34.442
There might be another reason
her sugar daddy's laying low.

09:34.476 --> 09:36.610
FBI database shows two
other victims strangled

09:36.644 --> 09:39.146
with metal fishing line
and their bodies staged...

09:39.181 --> 09:41.348
one in Miami, one in Fort Lauderdale,

09:41.383 --> 09:43.850
both unsolved, no suspects.

09:43.885 --> 09:45.518
Well, our victim's from Florida.
Maybe he knew her from there.

09:45.553 --> 09:47.955
Order the homicide files,
check 'em against our case.

09:47.989 --> 09:49.322
In the meantime, canvas the stores

09:49.356 --> 09:50.791
and the salons Pam went to.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.225
Maybe she confided in someone,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.227
or someone might have
seen her with this guy.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.064
(Castle) An M.E. investigates the murder

09:57.098 --> 09:58.465
of her own doppelganger.

09:58.499 --> 10:01.468
It'd be a great story, if
Lanie weren't living it.

10:01.502 --> 10:04.204
There's something that
we're missing here, Castle.

10:04.238 --> 10:06.506
Two similar murders in Florida.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.908
Our victim, also from Florida.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.944
But then there's this whole
Lanie and her look-a-like angle.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.147
- How does that fit in?
- I have no idea.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.381
Hey...

10:15.416 --> 10:17.282
we got a hit on those cheek implants.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.184
They were traced to a
Manhattan cosmetic surgeon...

10:19.219 --> 10:20.720
a Dr. Kelly Nieman.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.154
Well, I for one, am very interested

10:22.188 --> 10:24.389
in what Dr. Nieman has to say.

10:24.489 --> 10:25.656
In the meantime,

10:25.691 --> 10:28.826
Lanie wants to give her
statement to Esposito.

10:30.595 --> 10:32.896
You're not a perp, Lanie.

10:32.930 --> 10:35.999
It doesn't seem right... us
talking in here like this.

10:36.033 --> 10:37.467
I wanted to be somewhere private.

10:37.502 --> 10:41.004
- So let's get on with this, okay?
- Okay.

10:41.038 --> 10:44.575
Um... so can you think of anyone

10:44.609 --> 10:45.676
who would do a thing like this?

10:45.710 --> 10:47.511
No.

10:47.545 --> 10:50.479
(Sighs)

10:50.514 --> 10:52.348
Who have you been with
in the last six months,

10:52.382 --> 10:54.250
besides me? I mean, I
know we're not exclusive.

10:54.284 --> 10:55.484
No one.

10:55.519 --> 10:58.421
I need the truth... whatever it is.

10:58.455 --> 11:00.423
I'm telling you the truth.

11:00.457 --> 11:01.825
Then how do they know about the tattoo?

11:01.859 --> 11:04.227
You've only had it three months, right?

11:04.261 --> 11:05.595
No one could see it unless you're naked.

11:05.629 --> 11:08.531
Well, did you happen
to mention it to anyone?

11:08.565 --> 11:09.665
Of course not.

11:09.700 --> 11:12.201
You are the only person
I ever showed it to.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.036
Wait. Still, something's not right.

11:14.070 --> 11:16.539
This... this doesn't make sense.

11:16.573 --> 11:18.441
Come on, Lanie. Think.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.576
Someone got close to you.

11:20.611 --> 11:22.611
Someone saw that tattoo.

11:22.645 --> 11:25.214
Who was it?

11:25.248 --> 11:27.883
(Gasps) Oh, my God.

11:27.917 --> 11:29.218
What?

11:29.252 --> 11:34.123
I had a weird... night two months back.

11:34.157 --> 11:35.457
Weird how?

11:35.491 --> 11:37.425
Someone at work got promoted,

11:37.460 --> 11:40.595
and a bunch of us hit a
nightclub to celebrate.

11:40.630 --> 11:44.299
And some hot jazz was
going, so I stayed late.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.301
When I woke up the next day,

11:46.335 --> 11:48.870
I couldn't remember how I got home.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.906
Wa... wait, since when do you
go busting your 2-drink limit?

11:51.940 --> 11:53.941
I don't, and I didn't that night either.

11:53.976 --> 11:56.477
What...

11:56.511 --> 11:58.312
what if this is when it happened?

11:58.346 --> 12:00.248
What if he put something in my drink

12:00.282 --> 12:02.483
and took me to my place

12:02.517 --> 12:05.519
and all of this started because of me?

12:08.190 --> 12:09.356
I got your message. What'd you find?

12:09.391 --> 12:11.092
Nothing in Pam's pictures,

12:11.126 --> 12:12.826
but I scanned the camera's memory card,

12:12.860 --> 12:14.795
and I recovered a deleted picture file.

12:14.829 --> 12:17.264
(Beep)

12:17.299 --> 12:20.434
That's our victim. When was this taken?

12:20.468 --> 12:24.070
Based on the JPEG
data, yesterday afternoon.

12:24.105 --> 12:25.472
So just a few hours before she was killed.

12:26.608 --> 12:28.741
Let's locate that marina and
find out who owns that boat.

12:28.776 --> 12:31.211
(Telephone ringing in distance)

12:31.245 --> 12:32.645
NYPD I need...

12:32.680 --> 12:35.548
(Man) I'm sorry... do
you have an appointment?

12:35.582 --> 12:37.017
We're here to see Dr. Nieman.

12:37.051 --> 12:39.452
Can I ask what this is regarding?

12:39.486 --> 12:41.087
No.

12:41.122 --> 12:42.989
I'm sorry, Dr. Nieman.

12:43.024 --> 12:44.157
I apologize for the intrusion. This is...

12:44.192 --> 12:46.359
Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

12:46.393 --> 12:48.894
Uh, please come in. Have a seat.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.832
(Door closes) As a tireless self-promoter,

12:52.866 --> 12:54.334
let me offer you one of my pens.

12:54.368 --> 12:55.868
No, thank you.

12:55.902 --> 12:57.837
We're just here to ask you a few questions.

12:57.871 --> 13:01.606
Oh, can I just say, you have
an amazing face, Detective?

13:01.641 --> 13:03.843
And what about, uh...

13:03.877 --> 13:05.044
what about my face?

13:05.078 --> 13:07.379
Uh... amazing potential.

13:07.413 --> 13:10.482
Why don't we talk about Pam Hodges' face

13:10.516 --> 13:12.284
and the fact that she was murdered?

13:12.319 --> 13:15.020
Jeez. What happened?

13:15.055 --> 13:17.489
She was one of your
patients. Is that correct?

13:17.523 --> 13:20.826
Uh, yes. Yes, I performed some refinements.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.126
And at whose behest?

13:22.161 --> 13:23.528
Hers.

13:23.563 --> 13:25.797
She actually brought me a
picture of a friend of hers.

13:25.832 --> 13:27.899
They had similar facial structure,

13:27.933 --> 13:29.835
and Pam wanted to look a
bit more like her friend.

13:29.869 --> 13:31.603
Wait. Let me get this
straight. So people come in

13:31.637 --> 13:33.572
and ask to look like other people,

13:33.606 --> 13:35.406
and you just do it?

13:35.440 --> 13:38.276
Well, it's not unusual for
patients to bring me photos...

13:38.310 --> 13:40.979
usually of models or
actors... for reference.

13:41.013 --> 13:42.546
And these photos she showed you,

13:42.581 --> 13:43.814
where were they taken?

13:43.849 --> 13:46.217
They looked like snapshots
from a bar or a club,

13:46.252 --> 13:47.818
as I recall.

13:47.853 --> 13:50.521
Did she ever come here with anyone, um...

13:50.555 --> 13:53.257
did she ever mention any
of the men in her life?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.092
No, I'm afraid not.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.227
- And who was it that paid
- (Cell phone buzzing)

13:56.228 --> 13:57.728
for these new cheeks of hers?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.864
She did... with a company check.

13:59.898 --> 14:01.031
From Gregs-Baker?

14:01.065 --> 14:04.268
I'd have to look, but
that... that sounds right.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.203
(Buzzing continues) Um, excuse me.

14:06.237 --> 14:09.406
(Cell phone beeps) Beckett.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.908
Okay. Seriously?

14:10.942 --> 14:12.009
(Door opens)

14:12.043 --> 14:13.443
"Amazing potential"?

14:13.477 --> 14:15.879
And I'd love to help you realize it.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.881
(Whispers) Wow.

14:17.916 --> 14:18.620
Yeah, hey.

14:18.621 --> 14:20.529
(Ryan) We tracked down
that marina from the photo.

14:20.584 --> 14:22.085
It's Windward Cove in Long Island.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.820
- We're here right now.
- Who's boat was Pam on?

14:23.854 --> 14:26.155
It's registered out of
Florida to a Rudy Hollings.

14:26.189 --> 14:27.424
Okay, so what do we know about him?

14:27.458 --> 14:29.091
Not a damn thing, except
for Pam was on his boat

14:29.126 --> 14:30.627
the night she was murdered.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.730
- We're about to board. I'll call you when it's secure.
- Okay.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.679
- (Ryan) NYPD!
- (Esposito) NYPD!

14:50.713 --> 14:52.949
Police! Got a suspect up ahead!

14:52.983 --> 14:54.216
12:00! Let me see your hands!

14:54.251 --> 14:55.551
Let me see your hands right now!

14:55.585 --> 14:57.986
- Let me see your hands!
- Show me your hands, right now!

14:58.020 --> 15:01.657
<i>Let me see your hands!
Show us your hands now!</i>

15:01.691 --> 15:04.760
(Panting)

15:10.667 --> 15:12.033
What?

15:12.068 --> 15:14.469
- Espo, go outside. Don't look, man.
- What do you mean?

15:14.503 --> 15:16.438
What are you talking
about, go outside? Huh?

15:16.472 --> 15:17.805
Let me see.

15:23.379 --> 15:25.046
It's me.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.121
(Gates) Our victim is Daniel Santos

15:39.156 --> 15:42.224
like Pam Hodges, he was
hung with fishing line.

15:42.259 --> 15:45.528
Although Santos shows no
sign of cosmetic surgery,

15:45.562 --> 15:48.497
this killer... for reasons unknown...

15:48.532 --> 15:51.367
Has clearly selected two victims

15:51.401 --> 15:52.968
who bear a deliberate
resemblance to members

15:53.002 --> 15:54.703
of our own police family.

15:54.737 --> 15:57.005
Now, what did the crime scene give us?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.974
Well, there's no prints or trace evidence.

15:59.008 --> 16:01.209
All we know is that the
rig Santos was hung from

16:01.243 --> 16:03.645
was built from standard
hardware store pipe,

16:03.680 --> 16:05.047
and that the fishing reel that fed the line

16:05.081 --> 16:07.949
was bought from a bait shop
in North Carolina in 2005.

16:07.984 --> 16:09.517
Where are we on the owner of the boat?

16:09.552 --> 16:12.053
Rudy Hollings... he's
been in Spain for a year.

16:12.087 --> 16:13.588
He said he had no idea
who would've used his boat

16:13.622 --> 16:14.955
to commit a murder.

16:14.990 --> 16:17.492
So somebody could have been
aware of his travel plans?

16:17.526 --> 16:20.461
It's also possible if
the killer knew boats,

16:20.496 --> 16:21.829
uh, they were looking for telltale signs

16:21.863 --> 16:23.064
the boat wasn't in use.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.832
Yeah, that's probably
why he picked it, sir.

16:24.866 --> 16:27.068
He knew he could kill
Daniel Santos undisturbed.

16:27.102 --> 16:29.170
Well, what do we know about Mr. Santos?

16:29.204 --> 16:31.538
He moved here from
Georgia about a year ago,

16:31.573 --> 16:33.607
uh, I'm still trying to
find a current address.

16:33.641 --> 16:34.875
I did speak with his parents.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.877
They told me that he
worked as a male stripper.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.579
Three months ago, he called his parents

16:38.613 --> 16:39.914
to tell them that he quit stripping,

16:39.948 --> 16:42.382
and he had landed a big-time gig.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.017
Did they know what this gig was?

16:44.051 --> 16:46.320
No. He was vague, just like Pam Hodges.

16:46.354 --> 16:49.989
Okay. So I need you, Detective Esposito,

16:50.024 --> 16:51.558
and Dr. Parish to go over

16:51.593 --> 16:53.227
all the cases that you worked together.

16:53.261 --> 16:57.097
- See if anyone connected to them presents as a suspect.
- Yes, sir.

16:57.131 --> 16:59.933
For the sake of these
victims... and our own people...

16:59.967 --> 17:02.869
find this killer.

17:02.903 --> 17:06.039
(Clears throat)

17:06.073 --> 17:08.875
I still don't get it.

17:08.909 --> 17:11.845
Why would someone kill
clones of Esposito and Lanie?

17:11.878 --> 17:13.546
I mean, is it some kind of warning?

17:13.579 --> 17:16.115
Maybe if we dig deeper
into Daniel Santos' life,

17:16.148 --> 17:17.849
we'll figure it out.

17:17.884 --> 17:20.419
I think I've got a lead
as to what he was up to.

17:20.454 --> 17:22.688
According to his pre-paid
debit card records,

17:22.723 --> 17:24.890
he bought a latte at
the same midtown building

17:24.924 --> 17:27.893
every Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday afternoon.

17:27.926 --> 17:30.263
- As if he was keeping some kind of regular appointment?
- He did.

17:30.297 --> 17:32.131
According to the doorman,

17:32.165 --> 17:33.832
he was meeting with a Dr. Ian Fuller.

17:33.867 --> 17:35.467
He's some kind of a therapist.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.502
Actually, I'm a speech therapist.

17:37.536 --> 17:39.437
I specialize in accent reduction.

17:39.472 --> 17:41.840
Uh, so Daniel was from Georgia.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.643
- Was he trying to get rid of his Southern accent?
- Oh, more than that.

17:44.677 --> 17:46.711
He wanted to change his
entire speech pattern.

17:46.746 --> 17:47.813
To what end?

17:47.847 --> 17:50.749
He didn't say, but he was very determined

17:50.783 --> 17:52.417
and very specific about his goals.

17:52.451 --> 17:54.018
He even brought in an audio file

17:54.052 --> 17:55.219
of how he wanted to sound.

17:55.254 --> 17:57.522
- Do you have the file?
- Yeah, I have it right here.

17:57.556 --> 18:00.258
Let me just, uh, pull it up.

18:00.338 --> 18:01.705
(Beep)

18:01.739 --> 18:03.773
<i>(Esposito) It's true.</i>

18:03.808 --> 18:05.908
<i>For example, I'm former military,</i>

18:05.943 --> 18:07.776
<i>which makes me an expert marksman.</i>

18:07.811 --> 18:09.078
<i>I'm usually first through the door.</i>

18:09.112 --> 18:10.813
That's Esposito.

18:10.848 --> 18:12.481
<i>- I'm definitely the physical one.
- That's from the documentary</i>

18:12.515 --> 18:14.350
<i>- we shot right here at the precinct.
- I stay in sick shape.</i>

18:14.384 --> 18:16.152
<i>- Boom! Have you been to the gun show?
- Santos wasn't just a look-alike...</i>

18:16.186 --> 18:18.187
<i>- He was a sound-alike.- Seriously
though... (Speaks indistinctly)</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:19.521
(Beep)

18:19.556 --> 18:22.691
His face, the way he cut his hair,

18:22.726 --> 18:24.460
and now he's trying to talk like me, too?

18:24.494 --> 18:26.194
What kind of sicko is doing this?

18:26.229 --> 18:28.163
I went through every case we worked on,

18:28.197 --> 18:29.231
and nothing jumped out.

18:29.265 --> 18:31.132
Yeah, not for me either.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.468
It's gotta be...

18:32.502 --> 18:33.869
it's gotta be something personal.

18:33.903 --> 18:36.572
It's gotta be someone who
knows about our relationship.

18:36.606 --> 18:39.241
Well, whoever he is, he's a freak.

18:39.275 --> 18:41.343
He made Daniel Santos suffer.

18:41.377 --> 18:42.911
Look at the bleeding underneath the skin.

18:42.945 --> 18:45.947
That wire bit into his neck
for hours before he died.

18:45.982 --> 18:48.350
The killer used that fishing rail

18:48.384 --> 18:49.918
to kill him slowly.

18:49.952 --> 18:52.220
So who is he gonna go after now...

18:52.255 --> 18:54.389
you and me, some version
of Ryan and Beckett?

18:54.423 --> 18:57.057
- What if this is just the beginning?
- Hey...

19:00.562 --> 19:01.829
It'll be okay.

19:01.864 --> 19:03.831
I promise.

19:03.866 --> 19:05.600
I won't let anything happen to you.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.301
Yeah?

19:07.335 --> 19:09.871
What if something happens to you?

19:09.905 --> 19:11.238
Hey.

19:11.273 --> 19:14.275
Dude... we're having a moment here.

19:14.309 --> 19:15.376
Sorry... (Clicks tongue)

19:15.410 --> 19:17.378
I found the strip club where Santos worked.

19:17.412 --> 19:20.414
They had a home address for him in Queens.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.515
So how are you doing, man?

19:21.549 --> 19:23.117
I'm fine. How are you?

19:23.151 --> 19:24.919
It's big... what you're dealing with.

19:24.953 --> 19:27.254
I just want to put it out
there that I'm here for you.

19:27.289 --> 19:29.589
Good to know, man.

19:29.624 --> 19:32.258
The point is, sometimes
talking about it helps.

19:32.293 --> 19:34.528
So what, you want me to
share my feelings now?

19:34.562 --> 19:36.963
Uh, it's what a lot of people would do.

19:36.997 --> 19:39.399
All right, fine.

19:39.434 --> 19:40.434
I want to find this piece of garbage,

19:40.468 --> 19:41.902
string him up, and see how he likes it.

19:41.936 --> 19:43.737
There...

19:43.771 --> 19:45.771
- I shared a feeling. Happy now?
- See...

19:45.806 --> 19:47.106
Don't you feel better?

19:47.141 --> 19:49.775
- Ryan...
- All right.

19:49.810 --> 19:51.644
The super said that Daniel Santos

19:51.678 --> 19:53.279
- hasn't been around here much lately.
- (Woman) Oh, my God.

19:54.781 --> 19:58.484
- Daniel?
- (Chuckles) No. No, actually, uh,

19:58.518 --> 20:01.787
Detective Javier Esposito, NYPD.

20:01.822 --> 20:04.657
- Oh.
- (Chuckles)

20:04.691 --> 20:06.759
It's like seeing a ghost.

20:06.793 --> 20:07.793
You look so much like him.

20:07.828 --> 20:10.228
Yeah, um, so you knew Daniel?

20:10.263 --> 20:12.364
Not as much as I wanted to,

20:12.398 --> 20:13.732
but a little.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.100
(Sniffs) Enough to know that he was better

20:15.134 --> 20:16.435
than what he did for a living.

20:16.470 --> 20:19.004
We... we heard he quit that
job for some big-time gig.

20:19.038 --> 20:20.172
You have any idea what it was?

20:20.206 --> 20:21.806
He said he couldn't talk about it.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.608
Uh, did people come visit him here?

20:23.642 --> 20:25.844
(Chuckles) People didn't visit Daniel.

20:25.878 --> 20:27.612
It was more like the other way around.

20:27.646 --> 20:29.414
Meaning what?

20:29.449 --> 20:30.682
I'd see him, uh...

20:30.716 --> 20:33.852
leave here and a limo
would be waiting out front.

20:33.886 --> 20:36.020
- Was this recently?
- Yeah.

20:36.054 --> 20:38.122
One picked him up two nights ago.

20:38.156 --> 20:39.591
The same night he was killed.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.659
Do you remember what
that vehicle looked like?

20:41.694 --> 20:43.327
It was black.

20:43.362 --> 20:44.863
I mean, it was just a regular town car.

20:44.897 --> 20:49.634
But there was... blue
around the license plate.

20:49.668 --> 20:52.503
- Wait a minute. Do you mean blue neon?
- Yeah, that was it.

20:52.537 --> 20:55.172
Blue neon license plate frames...

20:55.207 --> 20:57.674
That's the trademark of Blue Moon limos.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.776
(Clacks) That was the
manager at the Blue Moon.

20:59.811 --> 21:02.113
He said the limo dropped Daniel Santos off

21:02.147 --> 21:04.548
at the apartment of the
person who ordered it.

21:04.582 --> 21:05.983
Well, whoever it is,
is probably our killer.

21:06.018 --> 21:06.984
Did he give you a name?

21:07.018 --> 21:09.052
Yeah, Dr. Kelly Nieman.

21:09.086 --> 21:13.356
Well, I would say she
has "amazing potential"...

21:13.391 --> 21:15.191
as a murderer.

21:27.629 --> 21:28.895
(Door opens)

21:28.930 --> 21:30.197
(Telephone ringing in distance)

21:30.232 --> 21:33.100
- Well?
- The doorman at her building confirms

21:33.135 --> 21:34.701
that Santos visited two nights ago.

21:34.736 --> 21:36.870
And not for the first time.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.672
<i>He said Santos was a
frequent overnight guest</i>

21:38.706 --> 21:41.574
- of the good doctor.
- Which directly connects her to both of our victims.

21:41.609 --> 21:43.677
So are we to believe that Kelly Nieman

21:43.711 --> 21:46.880
overpowered Santos...
a young man in his prime?

21:46.914 --> 21:48.414
<i>Well, she was more than capable.</i>

21:48.449 --> 21:49.950
According to her bio, she's a black belt

21:49.984 --> 21:51.685
in both tae kwon do and jiujitsu.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.354
She also has boating experience
and grew up in Florida.

21:54.388 --> 21:56.523
In fact, she was in Miami at a conference

21:56.557 --> 21:57.823
at the time of the other two murders.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.161
Do we have any hard evidence
linking her to these murders?

22:01.195 --> 22:02.295
It's been clear from the beginning

22:02.329 --> 22:04.364
that our killer is very careful.

22:04.398 --> 22:05.632
So the answer is no.

22:07.768 --> 22:09.702
(Sighs)

22:09.736 --> 22:12.405
This entire case is circumstantial,

22:12.439 --> 22:14.774
which means you're gonna need to break her.

22:14.808 --> 22:16.208
And you got one shot.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.781
(Door opens)

22:21.815 --> 22:23.783
Dr. Nieman...

22:23.817 --> 22:25.685
(Door closes) thank you for coming in.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.419
Was I offered a choice?

22:27.453 --> 22:29.221
I wanted to ask you a few questions

22:29.255 --> 22:32.257
about your relationship with Daniel Santos.

22:32.292 --> 22:33.792
Well, I no longer have one.

22:33.826 --> 22:35.194
So you are aware that he's dead.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.196
I watch the news.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.265
You don't seem terribly upset by it.

22:40.300 --> 22:44.403
Well, I suppose I could fake it or lie,

22:44.437 --> 22:47.138
but that's just as tedious
for you as it is for me.

22:47.173 --> 22:50.274
It was purely physical with us.

22:52.211 --> 22:54.445
<i>You really are a beautiful woman...</i>

22:54.579 --> 22:57.882
but not perfect.

22:59.285 --> 23:01.920
I could fix you.

23:01.954 --> 23:04.922
Where did you go after
he came to your apartment?

23:04.956 --> 23:08.091
Hmm. We stayed in.

23:08.126 --> 23:10.093
You didn't go by a marina?

23:10.213 --> 23:11.947
I don't have a boat.

23:11.981 --> 23:13.916
And yet his body was found on one.

23:13.950 --> 23:15.017
And prior to that,

23:15.051 --> 23:16.685
he was at your apartment.

23:16.720 --> 23:19.655
- Yes, but then he left my place.
- When?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.089
Around 10:00.

23:21.124 --> 23:23.458
Daniel Santos spent his last day with you.

23:23.492 --> 23:25.560
Pam Hodges was a patient of yours.

23:25.594 --> 23:26.962
They were both murdered.

23:26.996 --> 23:30.498
The only person that they
have in common is you.

23:30.533 --> 23:32.534
Now you don't expect me to believe

23:32.568 --> 23:34.469
that that's a coincidence, do you?

23:34.503 --> 23:36.838
It's not a coincidence at all.

23:36.872 --> 23:38.807
Daniel referred Pam to me as a patient.

23:38.841 --> 23:40.909
So they knew each other?

23:40.943 --> 23:42.710
We don't have any evidence of that.

23:42.745 --> 23:45.880
Well, I'm sure you'll find
some if you keep looking.

23:45.915 --> 23:48.683
When Pam came in, she said
that he'd recommended her to me.

23:48.717 --> 23:51.285
Let me ask you something.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.587
Has it occurred to you
that I'm being set up here?

23:53.621 --> 23:55.022
Set up by whom?

23:55.057 --> 23:56.824
Maybe whoever did this

23:56.858 --> 23:59.293
knew of my connection to Daniel and Pam.

23:59.328 --> 24:00.794
Maybe this was part of their plan...

24:00.829 --> 24:02.964
<i>to waste your time and mine.</i>

24:02.998 --> 24:04.332
I doubt that.

24:06.268 --> 24:08.535
You'll never prove that
I was at those docks

24:08.570 --> 24:11.137
or some marina, because I wasn't.

24:11.172 --> 24:14.174
Besides... what possible motive

24:14.208 --> 24:16.543
would I have for killing anyone?

24:18.847 --> 24:20.981
I've dated lawyers.

24:21.015 --> 24:23.283
I know that if you don't charge me,

24:23.317 --> 24:25.986
I can leave.

24:28.456 --> 24:30.656
No hard feelings, detective.

24:30.691 --> 24:33.460
We're both professionals.
You're just doing your job.

24:33.494 --> 24:36.796
You seek justice, and I seek perfection.

24:39.467 --> 24:41.901
In fact... (Card rustles)

24:41.935 --> 24:44.737
whenever you're ready to
take this to the next level...

24:48.041 --> 24:51.076
(Whispers) you come see me.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.247
(Door opens)

24:55.281 --> 24:57.583
(Door closes)

24:57.618 --> 25:02.087
(Telephone ringing in distance)

25:02.122 --> 25:05.090
I got nothing, Castle. I...

25:05.125 --> 25:06.858
I can't even tie her
to the Florida murders,

25:06.893 --> 25:08.960
<i>other than the fact
that she was in the area</i>

25:08.995 --> 25:10.095
when they occurred.

25:10.130 --> 25:12.931
Can I say something that'll...

25:12.965 --> 25:14.599
probably annoy you?

25:14.634 --> 25:15.634
(Sighs)

25:15.668 --> 25:17.536
Since when do you ask for permission?

25:17.570 --> 25:18.803
TouchÃ©.

25:18.838 --> 25:21.406
What if Dr. Nieman isn't our killer?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.041
Castle, you saw her in there.

25:23.075 --> 25:24.709
<i>She was toying with me.</i>

25:24.744 --> 25:26.778
She's involved in this.

25:26.812 --> 25:28.379
I can feel it.

25:28.414 --> 25:30.882
I admit... she's not warm and cuddly.

25:30.917 --> 25:33.117
But that doesn't make her guilty.

25:33.152 --> 25:35.819
How can you of all people buy her story?

25:35.854 --> 25:38.622
Because at this point, it
makes more sense than ours does.

25:38.657 --> 25:41.492
Just... consider this.

25:41.527 --> 25:44.295
All along, this killer has
been one step ahead of us...

25:44.329 --> 25:46.897
no evidence, no witnesses,
phantom corporations.

25:46.932 --> 25:48.366
He or she has us chasing our tails.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.401
So why, suddenly, does this same person

25:51.436 --> 25:55.639
order a limo placing her
with Santos the night he died?

25:55.674 --> 25:56.941
Rookie mistake.

25:56.975 --> 25:59.142
Or maybe it's not a mistake at all.

25:59.177 --> 26:02.112
<i>Maybe Kelly Nieman is
playing a much deeper game.</i>

26:02.146 --> 26:03.380
Maybe she's so confident

26:03.414 --> 26:05.049
that we can't tie her to these murders,

26:05.083 --> 26:08.251
that she's letting the trail
lead straight back to her.

26:08.286 --> 26:10.753
Um... that's looking pretty unlikely.

26:10.788 --> 26:12.289
Why?

26:12.323 --> 26:13.457
Her alibi's ironclad.

26:13.491 --> 26:15.192
She's no good for either
of the murders. But...

26:15.226 --> 26:16.659
we might have found somebody who is.

26:16.694 --> 26:18.761
(Muffled voice) Told you.

26:18.796 --> 26:20.130
(Ellis) This is from a traffic cam

26:20.164 --> 26:22.632
a block from Kelly Nieman's apartment.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.000
That's Daniel Santos.

26:24.034 --> 26:26.368
The timecode is 10:07. So
Kelly was telling the truth.

26:26.403 --> 26:27.604
He did leave around 10:00.

26:27.638 --> 26:29.338
Yeah, now watch this.

26:34.478 --> 26:35.478
Can we get a closer look at the driver?

26:35.512 --> 26:37.113
No, this is our only angle.

26:39.483 --> 26:40.682
Well, whoever he is, Santos knows him.

26:40.717 --> 26:42.284
Now we tried running the plate...

26:42.319 --> 26:43.452
(Beep) but it was stolen off another car.

26:43.487 --> 26:44.953
So no good there.

26:44.988 --> 26:47.156
(Beeps and whirs) But Tory
noticed a decal in the back window.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.991
(Ellis) It's a parking pass.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.227
For "Coral Way Marina" in Miami.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.495
So whoever he is, he could be connected

26:52.529 --> 26:54.597
- to our Florida murders.
- I called the marina.

26:54.631 --> 26:55.964
Even though the parking pass is expired,

26:55.999 --> 26:57.799
they were able to tell
us who it was issued to...

26:57.834 --> 26:59.300
one Carl Matthews.

26:59.335 --> 27:00.836
And who is Carl Matthews?

27:00.870 --> 27:02.638
- Show us the D.M.V. photo, please.
- (Beep)

27:02.672 --> 27:03.672
Recognize him now?

27:03.706 --> 27:05.406
(Beeps)

27:05.441 --> 27:07.776
That's the security guard from the dock.

27:17.395 --> 27:18.695
We now believe that Carl Matthews killed

27:18.729 --> 27:21.097
both Daniel Santos and Pam Hodges.

27:21.131 --> 27:22.499
That security mook that found her?

27:22.533 --> 27:23.900
How did we let him slip away?

27:23.934 --> 27:26.302
Matthews didn't have a record,
and nothing on him popped.

27:26.336 --> 27:29.272
Now the day after Matthews
"found" Pam Hodges dead,

27:29.306 --> 27:31.840
he quit his job, saying
he was too upset to work.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.309
Now he's in the wind.

27:33.343 --> 27:35.378
I'll bet this scumbag did
the Florida murders, too.

27:35.412 --> 27:36.612
It looks that way.

27:36.646 --> 27:38.915
He crewed fishing charters in Florida,

27:38.949 --> 27:41.884
which means he knows his way around boats.

27:41.918 --> 27:44.820
Now, in 2010, he went off the grid,

27:44.854 --> 27:46.522
and then he resurfaced about a year ago

27:46.556 --> 27:48.891
in New York when he
took at job at the docks.

27:48.925 --> 27:50.459
What's your next move?

27:50.493 --> 27:54.730
We've got an alert out
on Matthews and his car,

27:54.764 --> 27:58.633
but... our best bet is to get
in contact with his family,

27:58.667 --> 28:00.735
his friends, co-workers, ex-wives.

28:00.769 --> 28:02.870
Someone in his life has to know where he is

28:02.905 --> 28:06.207
and what his next move might be.

28:11.013 --> 28:12.080
Any news?

28:12.114 --> 28:14.515
No, not yet, but we'll find him.

28:16.384 --> 28:17.384
What's wrong?

28:17.419 --> 28:19.554
(Sighs)

28:19.588 --> 28:22.490
Carl Matthews is wrong.
He doesn't fit the story.

28:22.524 --> 28:24.058
How doesn't he fit?

28:24.092 --> 28:26.260
In Florida, he's basically a beach bum.

28:26.294 --> 28:27.862
Here he's a security guard.

28:27.896 --> 28:30.364
H... how's a guy like that pull this off?

28:30.398 --> 28:31.898
Maybe he just... (Sighs)

28:31.933 --> 28:34.034
reads more intelligent than he is on paper.

28:34.069 --> 28:36.070
What about the money...

28:36.104 --> 28:38.839
enough to put Pam Hodges in for surgery?

28:38.873 --> 28:41.775
He robbed a bank, or he was dealing drugs.

28:41.809 --> 28:43.377
I... I don't know. You know,

28:43.411 --> 28:45.212
he fell off the grid after he left Florida.

28:45.246 --> 28:47.347
Speaking of which, he's in Florida.

28:47.381 --> 28:50.116
He's off the grid. He's
never been arrested.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.352
Why the fixation with Lanie and Esposito?

28:52.386 --> 28:54.320
We don't have all of the answers, Castle,

28:54.355 --> 28:56.923
not right now, at least.

28:56.958 --> 28:58.692
But all of the evidence
is pointing to Matthews.

28:58.726 --> 28:59.926
I agree with you.

28:59.961 --> 29:01.928
I just don't think he's working alone.

29:01.963 --> 29:03.229
I think he has a partner.

29:05.199 --> 29:06.466
Like who, Dr. Nieman?

29:06.500 --> 29:09.002
No.

29:09.036 --> 29:10.936
Someone we've dealt with before.

29:13.007 --> 29:16.609
- 3XK? 3XK is dead.
- Is he?

29:16.643 --> 29:17.843
And what if we find Carl Matthews' name

29:17.878 --> 29:20.278
- in his case files?
- Jerry Tyson fell off that bridge.

29:20.313 --> 29:22.548
It was a hundred-foot drop into the water.

29:22.582 --> 29:23.716
Was his body ever found?

29:23.750 --> 29:25.584
Nobody could survive that fall.

29:25.619 --> 29:26.752
Jerry Tyson could.

29:26.786 --> 29:28.353
Castle, listen to yourself.

29:28.388 --> 29:30.322
There's not a shred of evidence

29:30.356 --> 29:33.158
that Tyson is alive, let
alone involved in this.

29:33.192 --> 29:34.259
Tyson doesn't leave evidence,

29:34.293 --> 29:35.593
not unless he wants us to find it,

29:35.628 --> 29:37.329
like that deleted photo.

29:37.363 --> 29:39.197
No evidence, plus meticulous planning...

29:39.232 --> 29:42.600
That's vintage 3XK, and
this case has it in spades.

29:42.635 --> 29:45.437
- Castle...
- And you want to know some other 3XK classics...

29:45.471 --> 29:47.839
Using people that look like other people.

29:47.873 --> 29:48.973
Using a killer to act on his behalf.

29:49.008 --> 29:50.675
Beckett, how can you not see it?

29:50.709 --> 29:53.578
What I see is the guilt that you feel.

29:53.612 --> 29:55.079
This isn't about me.

29:55.113 --> 29:57.214
Look, when Tyson escaped,
he outsmarted all of us.

29:57.249 --> 29:58.850
But you've always blamed yourself.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.986
Because I'm to blame...

30:02.021 --> 30:03.922
it's him... it's Jerry Tyson.

30:03.956 --> 30:05.790
Don't chase ghosts, Castle.

30:05.824 --> 30:08.825
- Okay? It's not worth it, trust me.
- (Woman) Detective!

30:08.860 --> 30:10.961
Looks like the 3XK files are gone.

30:10.995 --> 30:12.696
What do you mean, they're gone?

30:14.317 --> 30:17.286
All of them? How?

30:17.320 --> 30:19.221
Somebody must have signed them out.

30:19.256 --> 30:20.623
Who?

30:20.657 --> 30:21.890
Well, let me know if you
can think of anything else,

30:21.924 --> 30:25.226
- all right? Thanks.
- (Receiver clatters)

30:25.261 --> 30:26.628
Where are the 3XK files?

30:26.663 --> 30:28.530
What are you talking about?

30:28.564 --> 30:29.564
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

30:29.598 --> 30:31.599
Your name is on the signature sheet.

30:31.634 --> 30:32.901
No, it's not.

30:32.935 --> 30:34.803
- Yeah, from three days ago.
- You checked those files out.

30:34.837 --> 30:37.405
I didn't check out any
files. Somebody messed up.

30:40.777 --> 30:42.710
(Whispers) Oh, my God.

30:42.744 --> 30:45.547
Someone want to tell us
what the hell is going on?

30:48.484 --> 30:49.917
(Cell phone beeps)

30:53.222 --> 30:57.425
That was the head of the M.E.'s office.

30:57.459 --> 31:02.163
Reports, lab work, D.N.A., tissue samples

31:02.197 --> 31:05.399
of every suspected 3XK victim

31:05.433 --> 31:07.902
were checked out... by Lanie.

31:09.504 --> 31:10.905
Only not the real Lanie.

31:12.473 --> 31:14.008
Are you saying the son of a bitch is back?

31:14.042 --> 31:15.942
That explains the look-alikes...

31:15.976 --> 31:18.044
And why Santos tried to sound like me.

31:18.079 --> 31:19.680
It's not enough that
Jerry Tyson disappeared.

31:19.714 --> 31:21.415
He wanted his murders to disappear, too.

31:21.449 --> 31:25.285
And it's not just evidence. It's his M.O.s,

31:25.320 --> 31:26.920
victim preferences, all the hundreds

31:26.954 --> 31:29.289
of tiny case details
that can reveal psychology

31:29.324 --> 31:31.124
as to where he is, where
he might be going next.

31:31.158 --> 31:34.360
It's all gone... like
he's got a clean slate.

31:34.394 --> 31:37.263
Maybe not completely clean.

31:38.799 --> 31:40.499
Call the prison where Tyson did time.

31:40.534 --> 31:43.837
Have them secure his records
before they disappear, too,

31:43.871 --> 31:45.438
and then have them send us the copies.

31:45.472 --> 31:47.373
Oh, I'm all over it.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.275
A cruiser just spotted Matthews' car

31:49.309 --> 31:52.144
at the Starburst motel in Queens.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.413
That's the same motel
where we put up Jerry Tyson.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.385
(Man coughing)

31:59.419 --> 32:00.620
(Brakes squeal)

32:02.856 --> 32:05.891
Thanks. Front desk says he's in room 47.

32:05.925 --> 32:10.195
- That's the same room Tyson was in.
- Yeah.

32:16.569 --> 32:18.003
(Esposito) There's his car.

32:22.275 --> 32:24.342
Lights out in room 47.

32:24.433 --> 32:25.533
Listen, Castle.

32:25.567 --> 32:28.569
We don't know what's
waiting for us up there.

32:28.603 --> 32:29.970
You need to stay here, okay?

32:30.004 --> 32:31.171
You be careful.

32:31.206 --> 32:32.239
Let's go.

32:51.425 --> 32:53.727
Police! NYPD!

33:08.976 --> 33:10.576
(Rapid footsteps approach)

33:10.610 --> 33:12.611
(Grunts)

33:12.645 --> 33:14.146
(Grunts)

33:14.181 --> 33:15.281
Ow.

33:15.315 --> 33:16.682
Where is 3XK?

33:16.716 --> 33:18.050
Where is he?!

33:30.736 --> 33:33.137
How are you, Detective?

33:33.171 --> 33:35.773
Depends on how things go
down with Carl Matthews.

33:35.807 --> 33:37.742
(Footsteps approach)

33:38.650 --> 33:39.999
I'll give you two the room.

33:40.778 --> 33:44.581
- Doctor.
- (Whispers) Sir.

33:44.615 --> 33:46.750
What kind of twisted bastard

33:46.784 --> 33:48.985
murders two people for some files?

33:49.020 --> 33:50.687
That kind.

33:50.871 --> 33:54.174
Do we have proof that he killed him?

33:54.209 --> 33:55.475
Not enough.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.061
So what's gonna happen?

33:58.095 --> 34:00.564
We make him think that our case
is stronger than it really is,

34:00.598 --> 34:02.398
get him to confess.

34:02.433 --> 34:03.900
It's our only play.

34:03.935 --> 34:05.936
(Door opens)

34:11.574 --> 34:13.909
You broke three of my ribs.

34:13.944 --> 34:15.143
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.646
I was going for double digits.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.583
We need to have a candid conversation

34:20.617 --> 34:23.418
- about your future, Carl.
- (Castle) Or lack thereof.

34:23.454 --> 34:25.420
We found a steel fishing line

34:25.456 --> 34:27.523
in that backpack you were carrying.

34:27.567 --> 34:28.734
Here's a fun fact.

34:28.768 --> 34:30.402
Did you know that when you cut a wire,

34:30.437 --> 34:32.405
it leaves microscopic impressions...

34:32.438 --> 34:34.907
unique microscopic
impressions... in the metal.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.109
That's how we knew the wire in the pack

34:37.143 --> 34:39.277
came from the same spool that you used

34:39.312 --> 34:41.013
to hang Daniel Santos.

34:41.047 --> 34:43.649
We can also connect you to
the murder of Pam Hodges.

34:43.683 --> 34:45.483
Same wire, same cutting tool.

34:45.518 --> 34:47.319
And to the murders in Florida.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.221
Oh, yes. Where your fondness

34:49.231 --> 34:51.822
for fishing line was once again on display.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.725
But I think by this point in the trial,

34:53.759 --> 34:56.228
the jurors will have heard enough.

34:58.798 --> 35:02.366
Sounds like a lot of sticks and no carrots.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.545
Confess to all the murders, Carl.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.380
And Florida will take the
death penalty off the table.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.182
It's the best you're gonna get.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.918
I'm giving you life.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.854
(Castle) Which is more than
you ever gave your victims.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.129
<i>(Exhales deeply)</i>

35:34.065 --> 35:36.166
<i>(Clicks tongue) All right.</i>

35:36.200 --> 35:37.342
<i>I had a good run.</i>

35:42.106 --> 35:43.974
How many are there?

35:44.008 --> 35:46.977
Way north of four, if
that's what you're asking.

35:47.011 --> 35:50.246
Tell me about Pam Hodges.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.315
She was a fighter.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.916
And the look on her face...

35:53.951 --> 35:57.420
she wanted to live so bad.

35:57.455 --> 35:59.489
But I stood her on a shipping pallet,

35:59.523 --> 36:01.458
then pulled it away.

36:01.492 --> 36:06.229
And her feet were just...
just off the ground.

36:06.263 --> 36:09.365
I remember the toes of her shoes

36:09.399 --> 36:10.900
scuffing the wood.

36:10.934 --> 36:15.571
All panicky and fast, at first.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.106
And then slower.

36:19.442 --> 36:22.411
And then not at all.

36:22.445 --> 36:24.679
And what about Daniel Santos?

36:24.714 --> 36:27.182
With Daniel, I used the reel.

36:27.217 --> 36:30.019
So with each click I drew
in a quarter-inch of line.

36:30.053 --> 36:32.187
It got tighter...

36:32.222 --> 36:36.458
and then lifted him bit... by bit.

36:36.493 --> 36:39.995
Every time I hear a click,
I'm right back with him.

36:42.398 --> 36:44.365
How long do you think it's gonna take

36:44.400 --> 36:47.002
before we stop thinking
about what he's done?

36:47.036 --> 36:50.539
Till we stop... looking at each other

36:50.573 --> 36:54.009
and seeing two dead people?

36:54.043 --> 36:55.744
I don't know.

37:00.149 --> 37:03.651
You killed them both for Jerry Tyson.

37:03.685 --> 37:07.955
No, I admire his work.
But no, I'm my own man.

37:07.989 --> 37:10.258
And as your own man, you groomed them,

37:10.292 --> 37:12.927
paid for Pam's apartment using the money

37:12.961 --> 37:14.562
from the Gregs-Baker account

37:14.596 --> 37:16.730
that you established in the Caymans.

37:16.765 --> 37:18.966
Yeah, that's right.

37:20.969 --> 37:22.670
You're lying.

37:22.704 --> 37:24.237
That account was opened in Belize,

37:24.272 --> 37:25.439
not the Caymans.

37:25.473 --> 37:27.207
But you wouldn't know that because

37:27.241 --> 37:29.076
you weren't the one who opened it.

37:29.110 --> 37:31.344
Where's Jerry Tyson?

37:31.379 --> 37:33.547
Uh, he's dead is my understanding.

37:33.581 --> 37:34.747
So then why did you do

37:34.782 --> 37:36.716
all of this to steal the 3XK files?

37:36.750 --> 37:38.518
Why would you use the same motel?

37:38.553 --> 37:42.556
The same room where Jerry
Tyson escaped police custody?

37:42.590 --> 37:45.792
Someone recommended it.

37:45.826 --> 37:47.159
Plus it had free wi-fi.

37:49.162 --> 37:55.501
<i>I'll confess to my kills.
No more and no less.</i>

37:55.535 --> 38:01.007
I recall every one of them
in the clearest detail.

38:01.041 --> 38:04.843
All those memories.

38:04.877 --> 38:07.813
And to me, I won't be in a prison cell.

38:07.847 --> 38:11.484
I'll be living here.

38:11.518 --> 38:15.754
<i>Uh, I need a good pen and a pad of paper.</i>

38:15.788 --> 38:19.190
Uh, several pads, in fact.

38:21.027 --> 38:24.796
I know you think you've
got this all figured out,

38:24.831 --> 38:27.666
but you don't.

38:36.342 --> 38:38.576
(Door closes)

38:38.611 --> 38:39.710
(Sighs)

38:39.789 --> 38:42.524
What did he say about Jerry Tyson?

38:42.559 --> 38:43.825
Nothing.

38:43.859 --> 38:46.628
Hmm.

38:46.662 --> 38:50.199
The theft of those files was a
major security breach. (Scribbling)

38:50.233 --> 38:52.233
Be aware that the department is eager

38:52.267 --> 38:53.234
to put that behind them.

38:53.268 --> 38:56.571
It's an embarrassment.

38:56.606 --> 39:00.174
Sir, if a detective were
to suggest that Tyson,

39:00.209 --> 39:02.978
a man that the department's
already declared dead,

39:03.012 --> 39:04.112
might still be alive...

39:04.146 --> 39:06.481
An even bigger embarrassment.

39:08.783 --> 39:11.352
So if you're gonna make that claim...

39:11.386 --> 39:14.888
make damn sure you can back it up.

39:18.293 --> 39:19.893
I will keep that in mind, sir.

39:22.964 --> 39:25.666
What was that about?

39:25.700 --> 39:26.934
That if Tyson is alive,

39:26.968 --> 39:29.436
<i>the NYPD doesn't wanna know about it.</i>

39:29.470 --> 39:32.439
And what about you? Do you think he's back?

39:32.473 --> 39:34.241
Castle, people don't
just rise from the dead.

39:34.275 --> 39:35.609
So I'm still looking at other explanations.

39:35.644 --> 39:37.711
But if he is out there,
we have to find him.

39:37.746 --> 39:39.412
We're not gonna get any
more out of Carl Matthews.

39:39.447 --> 39:41.615
So... where do we start?

39:41.649 --> 39:43.750
Guys, I think I found something
in those prison records

39:43.784 --> 39:45.218
that got sent over.

39:45.253 --> 39:47.654
Do you remember right before
he was released from prison,

39:47.688 --> 39:49.222
Tyson got beat up by some inmates?

39:49.257 --> 39:50.857
Yeah, that's why we
pulled him out of there.

39:50.891 --> 39:52.022
We thought his life was in danger,

39:52.126 --> 39:53.893
but it turns out, he just
staged the whole thing.

39:53.928 --> 39:55.662
Right, but the beat down was real.

39:55.696 --> 39:57.230
He got sent to the infirmary.

39:57.265 --> 39:59.098
Look who was attending him.

39:59.132 --> 40:00.299
(Castle) Dr. Kelly Nieman?

40:00.333 --> 40:02.035
She volunteered as a prison doc.

40:02.069 --> 40:03.636
More importantly, she started there

40:03.671 --> 40:05.071
the week Tyson arrived,

40:05.105 --> 40:06.606
and she quit the day he was released.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.807
She knew him from before.

40:07.842 --> 40:09.442
She took that job to be close to him.

40:09.477 --> 40:10.743
She's gotta be Tyson's girlfriend.

40:10.778 --> 40:12.345
He taught her everything he knew.

40:12.379 --> 40:13.480
Get her back here.

40:13.514 --> 40:15.047
She's not answering her cell.

40:15.082 --> 40:16.115
She's not at her apartment either.

40:26.226 --> 40:28.427
Damn it! This explains
why you couldn't reach her.

40:28.462 --> 40:29.495
She bolted.

40:29.529 --> 40:31.997
And if Tyson's in this, he did, too.

40:32.031 --> 40:33.198
Seems like only yesterday

40:33.232 --> 40:35.266
this place was a thriving medical practice,

40:35.301 --> 40:39.505
<i>but... it was yesterday.</i>

40:39.539 --> 40:42.541
We still gotta clear the place.

40:48.114 --> 40:49.180
(Door bangs against wall)

40:50.983 --> 40:52.384
Beckett?

40:54.987 --> 40:56.321
What is it?

41:10.235 --> 41:12.537
(Beckett) Okay, all right,
thanks. (Cell phone beeps)

41:12.571 --> 41:14.539
So all of the electronic records

41:14.573 --> 41:17.808
from the 3XK cases were deleted, too.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.610
Not only that, but it
looks like our victims

41:19.645 --> 41:22.879
took evidence and files from
26 other unsolved murders.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.648
More murders committed by Tyson?

41:24.682 --> 41:26.550
Or Kelly Nieman.

41:26.584 --> 41:27.851
I don't know, Castle.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.619
I'm starting to think
she'd be capable of it, too.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.288
Tyson sure did pick the right woman.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.923
Plus she can change his appearance.

41:32.957 --> 41:33.957
Maybe she already has.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.926
You're still assuming that he's alive.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.594
Aren't you?

41:37.628 --> 41:38.962
<i>He must be.</i>

41:38.996 --> 41:41.130
Otherwise, why orchestrate
all this to steal the file?

41:41.165 --> 41:43.567
Well, maybe she just wanted
to keep his memory alive.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.636
Or his legacy.

41:46.671 --> 41:49.773
And that makes her just
as dangerous as he is.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.908
She's still out there somewhere

41:51.943 --> 41:53.876
with Jerry Tyson or without him.

42:04.488 --> 42:09.525
<i>(Vera Lynn) * we'll meet again *</i>

42:09.560 --> 42:12.294
<i>* don't know where *</i>

42:12.328 --> 42:14.863
<i>* don't know when *</i>

42:14.898 --> 42:19.366
<i>* but I know we'll meet again *</i>

42:19.401 --> 42:26.207
<i>* some sunny day *</i>

42:26.241 --> 42:29.978
<i>* keep smiling through *</i>

42:30.012 --> 42:32.713
<i>* just like you *</i>

42:32.747 --> 42:35.516
<i>* always do *</i>

42:35.550 --> 42:38.252
<i>* till the blue skies *</i>

42:38.286 --> 42:41.188
<i>* drive the dark clouds *</i>

42:41.223 --> 42:44.691
<i>* far away *</i>
