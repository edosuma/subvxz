everyone try and hate me.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.321

as a friend?

03:08.388 --> 03:10.023

love you more.

coming here, like,

03:16.496 --> 03:18.264

reconcile [bleep] with you?

but I like Callum.

{\an8}- There's been wrenches thrown
at Callum and Georgia.

03:23.102 --> 03:26.673

he really does like her.

like--I keep saying

03:28.675 --> 03:29.976

of my brothers

03:30.043 --> 03:31.477

he's like,

03:31.544 --> 03:33.046

{\an8}Like, we know
that you found love, bitch.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.653

and Callum if he came?

03:42.322 --> 03:43.389

handled it

03:44.624 --> 03:45.758

25:54.452 --> 25:55.954
{\an8}- I want to be.

25:56.021 --> 25:59.224
{\an8}- No. Nicole is caught,
by definition, red-handed.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.827
{\an8}Like there's video footage.
You cannot escape this.

26:02.894 --> 26:06.631
{\an8}You're done. You're screwed.
I'm thinking, "Oh, my God.

26:06.698 --> 26:08.633
{\an8}I would not like
to be you right now."

26:11.836 --> 26:14.439
The reality is that
when you know for a fact

26:14.506 --> 26:16.241
that you need the one,
the one,

26:16.308 --> 26:20.078
because I feel like sometimes
when you need people,

26:20.145 --> 26:21.680
you have maybe a 1%, 2%

26:21.746 --> 26:23.748
that you know that
this may not be what it is,

26:23.815 --> 26:25.984
so you take [inaudible] and you
take the piss of it,

26:26.051 --> 26:29.587
and then you do things
that you shouldn't do.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.323
You don't need to sit here
and be like,

26:31.389 --> 26:32.724
"Oh, this is what--"

26:32.791 --> 26:35.260
No one's thinking anything
bad about you.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.594
That's all. You are--

26:36.661 --> 26:37.862
- I'm getting mascara
on your shirt.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.332
- I don't care about
this shirt.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.533
- Oh, my God.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.168
- You're okay.
You are okay.

26:43.234 --> 26:44.970
You're so fine.

26:45.036 --> 26:49.441
- This is not
what I signed up for at all.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.943
{\an8}- It's just me and Georgia
going for the--

26:52.010 --> 26:53.979
{\an8}- I don't know, I'm feeling
like a little upset.

26:54.045 --> 26:58.149
{\an8}- Of course, that was hard.
I think--can I be honest?

27:01.252 --> 27:04.322
- It like brings back feelings
of like when we were

27:04.389 --> 27:07.792
in a relationship when I felt
like she made me look stupid,

27:07.859 --> 27:10.695
but I was still like--
- Babe, trust me right now,

27:10.762 --> 27:13.765
you didn't look stupid.
That's crazy.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.734
{\an8}If Callum ever, like,
cheated on me,

27:15.800 --> 27:19.504
{\an8}<i>I think I would cut him</i>
<i>out of my life forever</i>

27:19.571 --> 27:21.673
{\an8}'cause I would just walk away.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.541
- Maybe you just need
your space for a minute,

27:23.608 --> 27:24.709
just need to, like...

27:24.776 --> 27:27.112
- If you're ever
in a relationship

27:27.178 --> 27:29.647
and you get a feeling
that something's not right...

27:29.714 --> 27:30.982
- There's something not right.

27:31.049 --> 27:35.020
- That just confirmed
that my feeling--

27:35.086 --> 27:38.523
she talked me in circles
when we were in a relationship.

27:38.590 --> 27:42.093
And I want to pass
that onto you.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.762
Listen to your feelings.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.564
