06:21.005 --> 06:22.757

- I didn't even know you had it.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.097

06:29.097 --> 06:30.723
She came down to see me one day.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.562
Sat across from me, and she
took it right off her neck.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.441
Mama wrapped it around my hand.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.200
And she said you gots
to fight for something.

06:50.576 --> 06:51.577
- Why she say that?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.248

06:56.374 --> 06:59.127
(dramatic music)

07:01.421 --> 07:02.630
- I'm sorry man, I.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.402

07:40.084 --> 07:41.586
- You take peoples money.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.130
- No, not the people.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.133
Just the ones that tax us, take ours.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.754

08:33.261 --> 08:34.472
- Then what are you saying?

08:35.556 --> 08:37.892
- That you worked hard
to build up your castle.

Be nice to share it with
someone, that's all.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.525

but who's locked up?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.203
- You need to make sure you get out,

08:57.203 --> 08:59.288
enjoy your life a little bit.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.874

You mean that underground shit where you

09:29.318 --> 09:32.613

09:32.613 --> 09:33.614
That's not fighting.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.317
you don't know nothing about that.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.484
You don't know nothing about that.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.319
- Okay, I don't know nothing about that.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.653
- You don't know a God damn thing bro.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.071
Nothing.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.906
- Get out of here bro.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.080
Nah though little bro,

what you working for here?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.587

10:29.587 --> 10:32.006

10:32.006 --> 10:33.633
- Your end game, you know, like,

10:33.633 --> 10:37.303

you got the fancy car.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.807
But that's just material shit.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.437
What about, you know, starting a family?

10:46.437 --> 10:49.982
Or shit, helping kids that
grew up like you and me did?

10:51.817 --> 10:52.902
- Nobody helped me up.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.863
I had to grind for everything I got.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.282
That's why I sit where I sit.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.993
- That's true, that's true.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.371
But does it feel right.

11:03.371 --> 11:07.333
- Does it feel, you rob
liquor stores and banks.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.709
Does that feel right?

11:10.461 --> 11:13.047
- God works in mysterious ways.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.049
- There you go God, you God now?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.635
You helping people out and all that stuff,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.853
Come on, I'm rich, in here.

Remember when we was kids?

11:31.941 --> 11:32.775

11:32.775 --> 11:34.318
- I used to be running the streets.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.780
You was at home playing
video games all damn day.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.241
You said that you could hear the music

11:40.241 --> 11:43.035
of the game even when you wasn't playing.

11:44.328 --> 11:48.540
I think one time you
didn't eat the whole day.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.794
You got hella scared, came running to me.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.045
Big bro, make sure I don't

11:53.045 --> 11:55.923

your ass outside with me.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.517
What you used to tell me though?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.478
- I said I'd come outside when I win.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.021
- Exactly.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.648
When you motherfucking win.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.986
Come see me fight tonight bro.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.867
(train rumbling)

12:24.577 --> 12:27.580
(people chattering)

12:42.595 --> 12:45.097
- Damn baby, you looking good.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.893
- You tell your brother yet?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.562
- I told him that we have
something to tell him.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.189
- You still didn't tell him.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.901
You know he doesn't come
to these things Cyrus.

12:56.901 --> 12:57.902
- [Cyrus] He will tonight.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.196
- Is that so, why?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.489
- Because he's my brother.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.867
- He's not like you.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.121
- He'll be here, trust me.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.710
- I'm not gonna bet on it.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.671
- Can you just keep an eye
out for Marcus for me, please?

13:19.298 --> 13:20.466
Thank you.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.469
(people chattering)

13:29.099 --> 13:31.060
Yo, OG, I got next on this.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.144
Put me down for five.

13:32.144 --> 13:32.978
- Five?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.481
- Yeah, yeah, I got you young blood.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.025
What you hear about the
bank on 25th street?

13:38.025 --> 13:38.859
- I hear a lot of things.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.361
What you asking?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.279
- Is it clear to make a withdrawal?

13:42.279 --> 13:43.364
Word on the street's
that some large numbers

13:43.364 --> 13:45.407
finna fly through there.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.409
Early bird gets the worm.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.203
- Better be some big ass birds.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.789
Sesame street with all the characters.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.582
You know a lot of folks
been looking at them worms,

13:53.582 --> 13:55.835
but that show ain't
happening for a few days.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.923
- Is the network local?

14:03.759 --> 14:04.593
- Yeah.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.764
- So a few days.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.642
- Unless the chiefs out of commission.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.271
- I think we can make that happen.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.024
- So, who you trying to get in there with?

14:20.150 --> 14:21.986
- You know who.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.030
(people chattering)

14:25.030 --> 14:27.867
- Keep it down
motherfuckers, keep it down.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.910
Y'all know how this shit goes.

14:29.910 --> 14:33.038
No colors, no sets, guns, knives,

14:33.038 --> 14:35.665
or anything other than the
shit you was born with.

14:35.665 --> 14:37.501
Now we all family up in this bitch

14:37.501 --> 14:40.629
and we just wanna get a little
something off our chest.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.131
And if you're lucky,
make a little something

14:42.131 --> 14:44.758
on the side to keep the pockets right.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.970
The fights over if you get
knocked out, tapped out, or quit.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.599
Now our next fights gonna be a good one.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.268
We got Cyrus up against Malice.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.152
(Malice yells)

15:05.154 --> 15:06.864
All right you two, keep it clean,

15:06.864 --> 15:08.240
keep your guard up at all times,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.076
but most importantly, let's
have some fun with this shit.

15:12.161 --> 15:17.166
(audience cheering)
(dramatic music)

15:28.510 --> 15:29.929
- [Kelly] Come on baby, you got this.

15:29.929 --> 15:34.934
(dramatic music)
(audience cheering)

15:36.769 --> 15:41.774
(whacking)
(dramatic music)

15:55.829 --> 16:00.793
(dramatic music)
(audience cheering)

16:09.468 --> 16:14.473
(whacking)
(dramatic music)

16:23.941 --> 16:25.859
- Look at your man now!

16:40.915 --> 16:45.921
(whacking)
(dramatic music)

17:08.861 --> 17:11.363
(Cyrus yells)

17:13.949 --> 17:15.576
- That boy got a mean hook.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.703
- You can't keep doing this shit Cyrus.

17:18.619 --> 17:19.454
- [Cyrus] What?

17:19.454 --> 17:20.329
- Stressing me out like that.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.624
- Come on baby, you know I
was just having a little fun.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.709
- Fun?

17:23.709 --> 17:24.710
- Yeah.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.962
- You can't continue to
move like this Cyrus.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.383
Not if you're planning
on being here for us.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.761
- Yeah, no, no, you right, you right.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.346
I'll try to make sure the
blood stays inside my body.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.181
All right?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.436
- Marcus isn't here Cyrus.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.274
You need to tell him, tell him everything.

17:48.150 --> 17:48.984
Everything.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.323
- Let me handle something real quick.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.999
- Masaai want to talk to you.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.001
- All right, I'll hit
him up when I leave here.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.337
- No, he said he want to
talk to you right now.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.964
- Really nigga?

18:10.964 --> 18:11.965
You see I'm with my girl

18:11.965 --> 18:13.467
and that's how you finna pull up on me?

18:13.467 --> 18:14.301
- Cyrus I ain't trying to disrespect you

18:14.301 --> 18:16.762
cause we both on the same side,
but you know how Masaai is.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.098
Said he wanted to talk to
you about that bank job.

18:19.098 --> 18:19.932
To be honest with you,

18:19.932 --> 18:20.849
I don't give a fuck
about none of this shit,

18:20.849 --> 18:22.976
I'll smoke everyone in this motherfucker.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.561
You know how I get down.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.648
Let's get our bundles back
up man, you know what it is.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.109
- All right, all right, relax
bro, it's good, it's good.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.528
I'm a get my girl home,
then I'm a swing through.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.203
Come on.

18:41.203 --> 18:41.995
- Don't come over here with that shit,

18:41.995 --> 18:42.830
what the fuck does he want?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.748
- Man, I gotta do something.

18:44.748 --> 18:45.916
- Do what?

18:45.916 --> 18:46.750
- Something.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.584
- Then I'm going.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.002
- Baby, I gotta go alone.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.548
- Alone?

18:53.590 --> 18:54.424
Cyrus.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.759
- Baby, please.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.720
Let me take care of this,

18:58.720 --> 19:01.306
and I'll see you later tonight, all right?

19:05.269 --> 19:06.728
It's all right.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.230
- Promise me.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.064
- I promise.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.942
It's gonna be all right.

19:11.942 --> 19:12.776
- Okay.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.947
I'll be waiting for you.

19:16.947 --> 19:17.781
- Okay.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.968
- Got this, got this.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.812
(doorbell rings)

19:50.939 --> 19:53.150
Looking good, looking good.

19:53.150 --> 19:53.942
All right.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.616
Game time.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.661
Tanya?

20:04.661 --> 20:07.206
- Yes, Marcus?

20:07.206 --> 20:10.250
- Wow, I gotta say, you look amazing.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.210
- Thank you.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.753
- But yeah, yeah, come in.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.879
Please, come in.

20:18.675 --> 20:22.221
Can I get you anything to
drink Don Perignon, Don Julio,

20:22.221 --> 20:25.057
let me guess you're a Rose kind of girl?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.142
- Do you tell that to every
girl that comes into your house?

20:27.142 --> 20:29.019
- No, I don't, I just figured you'd

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
want something to drink.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.063
Just trying to be a good host.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.606
- No thank you, it's all right.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.692
Can I put this over here?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.861
- Yeah, by all means,
make yourself at home.

20:46.870 --> 20:50.290
- You have a nice place.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.875
- Thank you.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.709
I was actually thinking about putting

20:52.709 --> 20:54.086
a 60 inch screen right over there,

20:54.086 --> 20:56.213
with some surround sound
for the living room

20:56.213 --> 20:58.590
and the kitchen, you
know, really make it pop.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.511
You didn't want anything to drink right?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.179
- No, it's okay.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.306
Honestly I just want
you to come over here.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.435
- Sorry.

21:14.398 --> 21:19.403
- You know I'm honestly,
I've had terrible luck

21:19.736 --> 21:22.739
with all of the dating
apps that I've been on.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.951
So I'm really excited that
we're meeting right now.

21:25.951 --> 21:30.247
- Yeah, I think I can
attest to that, absolutely.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.624
I'm actually kind of
surprised that you agreed

21:32.624 --> 21:34.167
to come here, especially to my house.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.837
- Okay, honestly I wasn't
thinking about coming over,

21:36.837 --> 21:38.922
but my brother lives right down the street

21:38.922 --> 21:41.133
so if you're with any funny business

21:41.133 --> 21:42.801
he'll be over here, quickly.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.344
- Promise, listen, I promise

21:44.344 --> 21:47.764
I don't want any big brother problems.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.598
- Of course, understood.

21:48.598 --> 21:49.433
- Scouts honor.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.517
I am so happy that you're here,

21:50.517 --> 21:51.685
so that's genuine, that's real.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.519
- Thank you, thank you.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.062
And I'm glad you asked me.

21:54.062 --> 21:54.896
- Definitely.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.983
- So you're into computer programming?

21:57.983 --> 22:01.987
- Yeah, yeah, program management actually.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.323
Eight plus years, got into some things

22:04.323 --> 22:07.659
like stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Google.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.203
- Could I get some water actually?

22:10.203 --> 22:11.288
- [Marcus] Yeah.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
- I'm a little thirsty.

22:12.122 --> 22:12.956
- Yeah, totally.

22:12.956 --> 22:13.790
- Thank you.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.176
(water splashes)

22:27.220 --> 22:29.222
- Can I, here you go.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.057
- Thanks.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.850
- Can I get you anything else?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.060
- No, it's fine.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.521
- Okay, cool, can just so
you know I got us a 9:30

22:36.521 --> 22:40.484
at the Lounge, great restaurant,
I'm sure you'll like.

22:40.484 --> 22:41.318
- Yeah.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.531
- Cool, so you're a teacher, high school.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.284
That's awesome, tell me about it.

22:49.284 --> 22:53.538
- It's actually middle
school, but it's great.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.166
Honestly I think my favorite part

22:56.166 --> 22:59.795
is just watching kids
develop into who they are.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.381
Like whatever information I teach them,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.673
they're gonna have to go out into

23:03.673 --> 23:06.259
the world and utilize that one day.

23:06.259 --> 23:09.179
So I honestly think it's just amazing.

23:09.179 --> 23:13.016
- Wow, wow, I can tell you're
really passionate about it,

23:13.016 --> 23:14.935
is it something you've always wanted?

23:14.935 --> 23:18.355
- Yeah, I mean, no, I mainly wanted

23:18.355 --> 23:22.901
to be maybe and actress
or maybe a talk show host.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.446
But I really just wanna empower the world.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.489
- That's interesting.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.536
If I can ask, what changed?

23:34.663 --> 23:37.207
- Did you always want to
be in computer programing?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.419
- No.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.587
Funny thing about that is I actually

23:42.587 --> 23:45.006
just want to be just like my brother.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.425
- And what does he do?

23:50.429 --> 23:54.224
- Not much actually, in
his words he lives free.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.186
- You kind of say that
like it's a bad thing.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.313
Living free is great.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.654
- I mean, I mean like
there's no money in it,

24:08.905 --> 24:12.868
and I mean bums live free.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.827
I personally feel like you should

24:13.827 --> 24:15.287
just pursue the acting thing.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.788
Keep your pursuing that

24:16.788 --> 24:17.831
because everyone knows there's

24:17.831 --> 24:19.666
no real money in being a teacher, right?

24:19.666 --> 24:20.876
- Excuse me?

24:20.876 --> 24:22.461
I don't know what you think,

24:22.461 --> 24:26.298
but I don't think of money and
happiness as the same thing.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.967
There's a lot of lonely
and rich people at the top.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.554
- Starting to sound like my brother.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.472
- Maybe he's right.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.058
- I love him to death but he says

24:37.058 --> 24:40.020
the same thing and he has
nothing to show for it.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.814
- Okay, let me get this straight,

24:42.814 --> 24:45.025
do you think I have
nothing to show for myself?

24:45.025 --> 24:47.402
- No, no, no, you're twisting my words,

24:47.402 --> 24:49.154
that's not what I meant, I'm saying

24:50.405 --> 24:52.073
you're a high school
teacher, that's awesome.

24:52.073 --> 24:55.869
- Thanks asshole, I'm actually
a middle school teacher.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.829
And maybe you should think

24:57.829 --> 25:00.040
about building relationships with people

25:00.040 --> 25:01.958
before you just decided to brag

25:01.958 --> 25:04.336
about all the cool crap that you have.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.629
- I apologize, I didn't.

25:05.629 --> 25:06.755
Can we just, can we just take it back?

25:06.755 --> 25:07.839
I didn't mean that.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.508
- [Tanya] It's okay, honestly.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.967
- I'm sorry?

25:10.967 --> 25:14.387
- And you know, I do empower the world.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.431
These kids, they're the future

25:16.431 --> 25:18.433
and I'm trying to empower them.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.602
So have fun sitting at
the top by yourself.

25:24.940 --> 25:25.774
- Call me.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.946
(Marcus sighs)

25:36.034 --> 25:41.039
(man grunting)
(dramatic music)

25:47.337 --> 25:50.340
(suspenseful music)

26:06.481 --> 26:07.440
- This is Lucy.

26:08.733 --> 26:13.029
700 pounds, a big bitch.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.366
Loyal.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.370
She keeps her mouth shut.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.748
She lets me beat her, flip her.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.460
She doesn't say shit.

26:28.336 --> 26:33.341
Never talks, complains, and
separate men from beast.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.224
You and your crew took care
of the brinks truck last week.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.183
How much was in it?

26:45.186 --> 26:48.690
(suspenseful music)

26:48.690 --> 26:50.734
- Around 75K.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.193
- 75,000.

26:54.237 --> 26:58.575
Tomorrow I need you and
your crew at 25th street.

27:03.288 --> 27:06.458
I want you all to understand loyalty.

27:08.418 --> 27:13.381
You take care of me, I take care of you.

27:24.934 --> 27:29.814
This right here, is a
small part of loyalty.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.151
Trust.

27:34.486 --> 27:38.573
Getting shit done for the bigger picture.

27:44.996 --> 27:45.830
That's you.

27:51.795 --> 27:55.799
On the opposite end of
loyalty, you've got rats.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.220
And you could flush them out with cheese.

28:06.142 --> 28:11.022
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, please.

28:11.981 --> 28:14.317
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.613
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.783
Please don't, please don't, I'm sorry.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.954
- [Masaai] Nobody like rats!

28:25.954 --> 28:29.040
- [Boy] I'm sorry, please, I'm sorry.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.794
I wanna go home, I wanna go home.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.672
Please.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.091
(boy crying)

28:39.092 --> 28:41.511
Please, please, please.

28:41.511 --> 28:46.182
I didn't mean it, I didn't
mean it, I didn't mean it.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.852
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:51.438 --> 28:52.689
Please, please.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.736
- He's just a kid.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.113
- Mice and rats do the same shit.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.448
Big Mike got 20 years

29:01.448 --> 29:04.409
because somebody
recognized him in a lineup.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.245
That could have been any one of us.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.248
(suspenseful music)

29:16.171 --> 29:17.964
- Kids make mistakes Masaai.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.674
It shouldn't cost them everything.

29:25.513 --> 29:26.347
- It shouldn't.

29:28.558 --> 29:33.563
Another reason why Lucy
separates men from beast.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.192
(tire thuds)

29:37.192 --> 29:39.944
(dramatic music)

29:44.449 --> 29:48.077
Men and beast.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.086
- So tomorrow?

30:00.173 --> 30:02.842
- Yeah, tomorrow.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.278
- Let's go man, check
it out, check it out.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.905
You know I gotta make
you look bad, all right?

30:23.905 --> 30:24.989
- I'm right here man.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.282
- Okay, show me.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.617
Look what I got.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.957
Got 'em cooach, you ain't never
too old for a spanking baby.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.875
- Yeah, okay, I call that luck.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.210
- [Cyrus] Yeah, okay, I call it skill.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.044
- All right up top.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.754
- Okay, I call it skill man.

30:39.754 --> 30:40.880
- Let me see that skill from right there,

30:40.880 --> 30:42.715
pull that J, what you got?

30:42.715 --> 30:44.300
I want the jumper

30:46.261 --> 30:47.095
- Damn.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.221
- I take that up top.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.973
Let little bro show you
how it's done, yeah?

30:49.973 --> 30:50.849
- All right.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.225
- Check this up top.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.143
- Let's go.

30:54.143 --> 30:54.978
- Right here, I want it.

30:54.978 --> 30:55.937
- What you want, what you want?

30:58.231 --> 30:59.065
- Whoo!

31:00.066 --> 31:01.276
- [Cyrus] That's how it's done

31:01.276 --> 31:04.404
- Heavy, them W's are
real heavy right now man.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.573
- Wow, wow.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.949
- I mean you look like
you had a nice workout,

31:07.949 --> 31:09.951
them L's must weigh something.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.579
- Oh my goodness, good
game bro, you got it.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.621
- Good game, good game.

31:13.621 --> 31:14.455
- You got that one.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.290
Damn.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.212
What's up bro, what's on your mind?

31:21.212 --> 31:22.589
- You always could read me.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.801
Honestly man I was just thinking

31:26.801 --> 31:29.053
about what you said the other day.

31:29.053 --> 31:29.888
- About what?

31:31.806 --> 31:33.308
- You know, if it feels right.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.227
The cars, the money, shit like that.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.061
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.565
- I just never thought about it.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.650
- You should bro, you really should.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.153
What happened to you last night?

31:48.156 --> 31:49.782
- I had a date.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.783
- A date?

31:50.783 --> 31:51.618
- Date.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.536
- Okay, my man, my man.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.914
I thought you was just
trying to blow my fight off.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.624
- Come on bro, you know I
just don't get down with that,

31:57.624 --> 32:00.668
that's all, it's no disrespect,
it's just that street shit?

32:00.668 --> 32:01.586
I can't support it.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.880
- I'm not looking for your support bro,

32:03.880 --> 32:06.883
I just wanted you to see
my last fight in the ring.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.385
- Last fight for real?

32:09.385 --> 32:11.054
- Yeah, my last fight bro.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.931
I got other plan in effect.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.767
Setting something up that
I want you to be apart of.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.268
- Honestly, so long as those plans

32:17.268 --> 32:20.063
don't involve you going back
to jail, I'm all for it.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.314
The real question is this man,

32:21.314 --> 32:23.274
when are you gonna let me
hook you up with a job?

32:24.192 --> 32:25.485
- Man, fuck all of that man,

32:25.485 --> 32:27.153
plus we got something to tell you.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.239
- We as in like you and Kelly?

32:30.239 --> 32:32.241
Boy, you know she don't
mess with me like that.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.410
- She don't know you like that bro.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.914
You always busy, some new
promotion or some shit.

32:37.914 --> 32:41.918
- Fam, she cussed me out smooth last time.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.211
Disrespectful.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.045
- Yeah, that was funny.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.046
- [Marcus] That was funny?

32:45.880 --> 32:46.714
- [Cyrus] That was funny.

32:46.714 --> 32:47.548
- Okay.

32:47.548 --> 32:51.052
- Look though man, try to
get to know her for me.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.763
Y'all got a lot more in
common then you think.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.099
Probably why I love both of y'all.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.352
- Yeah, look I'll try
man, I guess sometimes

32:59.352 --> 33:01.437
I just don't see the
similarities, that's all.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.650
- Well I gotta get up
out of here man, but.

33:08.444 --> 33:09.487
Let me know when you're free though,

33:09.487 --> 33:11.572
to see me and Kelly, all right?

33:11.572 --> 33:12.407
I gotta go.

33:13.908 --> 33:15.576
- You gotta, you leaving right now?

33:15.576 --> 33:16.828
Think we could play one last game,

33:16.828 --> 33:18.955
you know, pick up, something.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.123
Give you this last L.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.500
- I gotta meet up with somebody bro,

33:22.500 --> 33:24.002
no more L's for me today.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.211
- All right,

33:25.211 --> 33:26.963
I respect it man.

33:26.963 --> 33:27.880
- I love you bro.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.507
- I love you to bro.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.341
- [Cyrus] Take care of yourself.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.175
- Stay up man.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.721
(ball thudding)

33:40.476 --> 33:43.688
(gun clicks)

33:43.688 --> 33:45.314
- Why you park over here?

33:45.314 --> 33:47.150
Bank like, down the street.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.444
- Seemed like a cool little
vantage point from here.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.281
- All right you know the drill.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.199
We in, we out.

33:56.367 --> 33:59.245
No bystanders, and don't
get fucking greedy.

34:01.247 --> 34:02.707
- Cyrus, I don't know about this one G.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.584
- Know about it.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.378
Come on bro, why you so nervous?

34:07.378 --> 34:09.130
Acting like we ain't done this before.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.012
(suspenseful music)

34:16.012 --> 34:16.846
Fuck.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.683
Killah, this look like a set up bro.

34:20.683 --> 34:21.809
- [Killah] What?

34:21.809 --> 34:22.893
- A set up nigga.

34:25.063 --> 34:25.897
(dash bangs)

34:25.897 --> 34:26.731
Fuck!

34:27.648 --> 34:28.775
All right.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.609
Check it out.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.652
We're gonna rob this
motherfucking bank regardless.

34:32.652 --> 34:35.572
Even if we got to go through
that nigga, on my mama.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.033
- Serious Cyrus?

34:37.033 --> 34:37.909
- Dead ass bro.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.416
That's a lot of sweat.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.418
(suspenseful music)

34:53.299 --> 34:55.217
He sent you to do it?

34:55.217 --> 34:58.221
(suspenseful music)

35:01.474 --> 35:03.810
So that big bitch couldn't
do it himself, huh?

35:04.685 --> 35:06.646
When's it supposed to happen?

35:06.646 --> 35:09.649
(suspenseful music)

35:10.691 --> 35:12.777
- After we rob this bank.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.447
Cyrus, he knew what you were
doing with that money bro.

35:19.742 --> 35:20.576
I'm sorry man.

35:24.956 --> 35:25.790
- The fuck you doing nigga?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.960
(dramatic music)
(men yelling)

35:28.960 --> 35:29.794
Motherfucker!

35:29.794 --> 35:32.547
(dramatic music)

35:46.310 --> 35:47.395
(gun clicks)

35:47.395 --> 35:48.229
Killah!

35:48.229 --> 35:50.565
(gun fires)

36:01.909 --> 36:03.536
- [Phone] Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.579
Hold on a second.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.913
What you're really trying to tell me

36:05.913 --> 36:08.541
is you didn't even get a kiss

36:09.750 --> 36:10.793
- Listen man, all I'm saying

36:10.793 --> 36:11.919
is she started tripping as soon

36:11.919 --> 36:13.337
as I said she should get a different job

36:13.337 --> 36:15.965
because, surprise,
teachers don't make much.

36:17.550 --> 36:18.843
- [Phone] Damn man.

36:18.843 --> 36:19.677
She should have written you a check

36:19.677 --> 36:21.971
for giving her financial advice.

36:21.971 --> 36:22.847
- Right?

36:22.847 --> 36:23.764
I'm dropping gems,

36:23.764 --> 36:25.683
and she's not even trying to pick them up.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.311
- [Phone] Man, her loss.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.854
You know we need to
create our own dating app,

36:29.854 --> 36:33.316
you know one that finds
chicks that understand us.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.484
- No, no, we don't need
to make an app man.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.321
- [Phone] Come on man, we have everything

36:38.321 --> 36:39.739
we need in front of us,

36:39.739 --> 36:42.033
and we know how to operate the system.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.577
- My man.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.871
Are we going to get back to work?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.624
- [Phone] Yeah, yeah,
we can get back to it.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.584
I'm just saying, since we're already

36:51.584 --> 36:53.586
out here changing the world with

36:53.586 --> 36:55.671
the way that people
interact with their phones

36:55.671 --> 36:58.257
and computers, we already understand

36:58.257 --> 37:00.051
the back end development.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.677
It'd be awesome to manipulate

37:01.677 --> 37:03.471
the system and get what we want.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.931
- Yeah, but see, that's the problem.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.350
People are flesh and blood,
they're not just and app.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.186
You can't program in it
and get what you want.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.313
- [Phone] No, no man, I call bullshit.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.357
Everyone is so connected to this system,

37:14.357 --> 37:15.942
they probably don't even know how to make

37:15.942 --> 37:19.987
a decision without consulting
the social media overlords.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.072
(Marcus chuckles)

37:21.072 --> 37:22.949
- People will be fine man.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.367
We got a system in place that,

37:24.367 --> 37:25.993
so long as everyone does their position,

37:25.993 --> 37:28.162
you know, they play it
right, they'll be fine.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.998
- [Phone] Yeah man, you
know man, you got some--

37:30.998 --> 37:31.832
(door bangs)

37:31.832 --> 37:33.417
Rodger should be announcing who's getting

37:33.417 --> 37:35.962
that new position down South in two weeks.

37:35.962 --> 37:36.796
- Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's gonna

37:36.796 --> 37:38.673
be a lot of money man, big money.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.050
- [Phone] Hell yeah.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.802
plus stock options and RSU's.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.888
You know, I think you're gonna get it.

37:47.181 --> 37:48.891
- Fingers crossed man.

37:48.891 --> 37:50.935
I mean, if everything works out,

37:50.935 --> 37:53.354
we could put a whole new system in place.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.064
(door bangs)

37:55.064 --> 37:55.898
Wait, wait.

37:55.898 --> 37:58.317
- [Phone] What system is that?

37:58.317 --> 38:01.320
(suspenseful music)

38:04.365 --> 38:06.951
- What the fuck, what the fuck?

38:08.661 --> 38:09.578
- You gonna be an uncle nigga.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.914
- Not like this, what the fuck?

38:11.914 --> 38:13.124
What the hell did you?

38:13.124 --> 38:18.129
Who did this, what the fuck
happened, who shot you?

38:18.170 --> 38:20.172
- Marcus, Marcus, hey, hey.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.926
I love you man, I love you brother.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.428

you ain't doing this.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.680
- You gonna be and uncle man.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.514
You gonna be an uncle.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.682
- Stop, stop, you're gonna
be a great fucking dad

38:29.682 --> 38:33.311
when that happens, but we gotta
keep pressure on this shit.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.937
Stop talking.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.314
You'll make it alive.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.066
Fuck, you'll make it alive, shit.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.778
Hold on, hold, hold on.

38:42.778 --> 38:43.863
Let me get the phone.

38:43.863 --> 38:47.283
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.122
- Get this bag to Kelly.

38:54.790 --> 38:55.875
- I need an ambulance right now!

38:55.875 --> 38:59.378
I'm at 720 Kirkwood Avenue,
my brothers been shot.

38:59.378 --> 39:02.631
Please, just come right now,

39:02.631 --> 39:04.342
- [Cyrus] You're gonna be an uncle bro,

39:04.342 --> 39:05.176
you're gonna be an uncle.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.844
- You'll be a good dad,
we won't worry about that.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.221
Just keep pressure here,
stop talking Cyrus.

39:09.221 --> 39:10.056
- [Cyrus] Kelly's pregnant.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.683
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:12.683 --> 39:16.270
- Pressure on the wound,
God damn it, fuck!

39:17.104 --> 39:19.690
No, you straight, you straight.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.694
No, I don't want it, I don't want it.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.447
(dramatic music)

39:28.407 --> 39:32.578
- You got to fight for something.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.415
Fight for something.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.962
(dramatic music)

39:45.549 --> 39:46.384
- Fuck!

39:50.262 --> 39:52.932
(Marcus crying)

39:52.932 --> 39:54.183
Fuck!

39:54.183 --> 39:59.188
(Kelly crying)
(dramatic music)

40:19.458 --> 40:22.711
- I'm sorry I wasn't there for you two.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.054
I'm gonna find who did this.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.305
I promise you.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.058
(dramatic music)

40:56.328 --> 40:57.663
- Marcus, you've been pacing

40:57.663 --> 41:00.332
for like an hour now
man, you need to chill.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.210
Come on man.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.462
The cops are going to be here any minute

41:04.462 --> 41:05.629
and I'm sure they'll have some kind

41:05.629 --> 41:07.506
of lead or something for you.

41:07.506 --> 41:09.091
- It's been three weeks.

41:09.091 --> 41:10.009
Last time they were here,

41:10.009 --> 41:11.677
they took me in, wrecked my shit,

41:11.677 --> 41:13.345
and accused me of killing Cyrus.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.556
They need to start doing their jobs.

41:15.556 --> 41:16.390
(door knocks)

41:16.390 --> 41:17.975
Damn!

41:17.975 --> 41:20.478
(door knocks)

41:22.480 --> 41:23.314
Officer.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.148
- Marcus Sims?

41:24.148 --> 41:25.065
- Yes sir.

41:25.065 --> 41:25.900
Any news of who shot my brother?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.485
- Do you have a gun in the house?

41:29.195 --> 41:30.029
- What?

41:30.029 --> 41:32.198
- Do you have a gun on the premises?

41:34.700 --> 41:38.037
- No, we went through this already.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.247
Do you have any fucking thing for me?

41:40.247 --> 41:42.291
- You need to calm down Mr. Sims.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.628
I was just asking you a question.

41:45.628 --> 41:48.339
- No, who shot my brother?

41:49.298 --> 41:51.258
Do you have anything for me?

41:51.258 --> 41:54.094
- Did you know your brother was in a gang?

41:54.094 --> 41:56.722
He even did some time a few years ago.

41:59.016 --> 41:59.850
It's only common that something

41:59.850 --> 42:01.852
like this was gonna
happen sooner or later.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.396
- Common, so that makes it okay?

42:05.397 --> 42:07.441
I haven't heard shit about this case.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.984
Are you guys even fucking doing your jobs?

42:08.984 --> 42:10.861
- Don't question what we do.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.241
Your brother robbed a bank, and came here.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.368
And yet none of the money was found.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.662
I could you run you in as an accomplice.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.288
- Run me as a?

42:21.288 --> 42:22.498
You mother.

42:22.498 --> 42:25.960
- You better choose your
next words carefully boy.

42:31.173 --> 42:34.385
Or it won't be just your brothers
blood spilt in this house.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.471
- Officer, sorry about the hassle.

42:37.471 --> 42:39.265
My friend here is still a little shaken up

42:39.265 --> 42:40.766
about the loss of his brother.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.143
We'll call you if we need anything.

42:44.144 --> 42:46.564
Is there anything else we
can help you with officer?

42:46.564 --> 42:47.398
- No.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.568
Looks like I'm done here.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.656
You got a nice place here Marcus.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.703
(radio chattering)

43:04.248 --> 43:05.666
(door bangs)

43:05.666 --> 43:06.500
- What the fuck was that shit about.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.419
- Bro, you almost got
shot, that's what that was.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.796
- They basically ain't doing shit

43:10.796 --> 43:12.047
and then they want to put the blame on me

43:12.047 --> 43:13.799
so they don't have to
do their fucking jobs.

43:13.799 --> 43:14.633
It's bullshit.

43:14.633 --> 43:16.802
- Relax dude.

43:16.802 --> 43:18.596
You always say system works.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.598
- No, fuck the system.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.520
I got it.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.063
- [Man] What?

43:28.063 --> 43:30.608
- Remember how we talked
about creating that program?

43:30.608 --> 43:33.193
If the system doesn't work,
create one for yourself.

43:34.737 --> 43:35.571
- I still don't get it.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.323
How did this turn into getting chicks?

43:37.323 --> 43:38.449
Are you trying to make
your own dating app?

43:38.449 --> 43:41.035
- No, no, no, no.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.829
I'm gonna do what the
system's supposed to do.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.289
- By yourself?

43:45.289 --> 43:46.123
- Yeah.

43:47.833 --> 43:48.667
- Okay.

43:49.501 --> 43:50.377
What's your plan?

43:56.050 --> 43:57.051
- First I gotta find out who was

43:57.051 --> 43:59.011
there during the bank robbery.

43:59.011 --> 44:01.305
- yoU just want to get
the banks camera footage?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.890
I'm pretty sure they wore masks.

44:04.350 --> 44:08.062
- Yeah, I know my brother had
a crew that he rolls with.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.480
Shit, maybe they'll know something.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.065
- So you want to go up to a bunch

44:11.065 --> 44:13.984
of gangsters and say,
what, who shot my brother,

44:13.984 --> 44:15.611
so I can turn them into the cops?

44:15.611 --> 44:18.072
- Shit dude, I don't fucking know.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.575
I'm just hoping maybe if I'm around

44:21.575 --> 44:23.202
and I fucking hear something.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.623
- No offense Marcus,
but your no Neio Brown.

44:29.750 --> 44:30.584
- I don't Know if I should slap you

44:30.584 --> 44:32.503
or high five you for
knowing that reference.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.380
- High five, but the fact that

44:34.380 --> 44:36.465
you said high five proves my point.

44:38.425 --> 44:39.259
- Whatever.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.514
- [Man] So how do you plan

44:43.514 --> 44:45.474
on getting close to your brothers crew?

44:49.478 --> 44:50.312
- Kelly.

44:56.902 --> 44:57.736
Thank you for coming Kelly.

44:57.736 --> 44:58.612
- What do you want?

44:59.947 --> 45:01.490
- Can you just take a seat please?

45:09.748 --> 45:12.418
I'm not trying to reopen old wounds.

45:13.627 --> 45:16.171
I need to know who Cyrus
was with during the robbery.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.589
- Is that why you brought me here?

45:17.589 --> 45:19.633
- No, that's not the case, listen.

45:19.633 --> 45:21.468
The police think I killed Cyrus.

45:21.468 --> 45:23.053
- You're trying to clear your name.

45:23.053 --> 45:24.763
- Kelly, that's not the case.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.143
- I actually thought you
cared about who killed Cyrus.

45:29.143 --> 45:30.269
- Don't, don't do that.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.313
- Sounds like something you would do.

45:33.313 --> 45:35.524
Selfish and only thinking about yourself.

45:37.776 --> 45:40.738
- I earned that, that's fair,

45:40.738 --> 45:42.072
but I still need your help.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.282
- Why should I help you?

45:45.659 --> 45:47.161
- Because we're family Kelly.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.581
Because I'm trying to be a good uncle

45:50.581 --> 45:52.374
for my niece or for my nephew.

45:54.626 --> 45:55.919
I'm trying to do everything

45:55.919 --> 45:58.547
I'm supposed to do for you, for myself.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.175
For Cyrus.

46:09.516 --> 46:10.684
- He told you?

46:12.436 --> 46:15.939
- Yeah, he told me before he passed.

46:24.740 --> 46:28.952
- I don't know who Cyrus was
with but I think I might,

46:30.871 --> 46:32.831
I think I might know someone who knows.

46:34.249 --> 46:35.083
- Who .

46:35.083 --> 46:35.918
- They call him OG.

46:38.295 --> 46:39.129
- OG huh?

46:39.129 --> 46:40.255
- Yeah.

46:40.255 --> 46:43.175
He holds these fights, and if anybody

46:43.175 --> 46:46.011
knows who did it, it's him.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.932
- Can you get me in?

46:49.932 --> 46:51.099
- I'm pretty sure I can.

46:52.392 --> 46:55.687
But Marcus, if the guys
who shot Cyrus are there,

46:55.687 --> 46:57.731
what makes you think they
ain't gonna do the same to you?

46:57.731 --> 46:59.441
- No, I'm not worried about that,

46:59.441 --> 47:01.693
they don't know I'm his brother.

47:01.693 --> 47:04.154
- So what are you gonna do
when you find out who did it?

47:05.906 --> 47:07.699
- I don't know right now.

47:07.699 --> 47:08.534
- You don't know?

47:09.701 --> 47:10.661
Marcus, these people don't play

47:10.661 --> 47:12.871
by the rules they will kill you.

47:15.541 --> 47:16.792
- So when are we leaving?

47:22.756 --> 47:25.592
(sirens whirring)

47:27.594 --> 47:28.804
- [Kelly] All right Marcus,
we gotta keep it cool.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.389
- [Marcus] Hey don't
worry about me, I got it.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.226
- See that guy over there?

47:34.226 --> 47:35.060
- Yeah.

47:35.060 --> 47:35.936
- That's OG.

47:35.936 --> 47:37.229
- In the pink?

47:37.229 --> 47:38.063
- Yeah.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.982
- All right, wait here.

47:42.150 --> 47:43.694
You OG?

47:43.694 --> 47:44.903
- Boy what the fuck you want?

47:44.903 --> 47:45.863
- Are you OG?

47:45.863 --> 47:48.073
- Who the fuck is asking?

47:48.073 --> 47:48.907
- Marcus.

47:48.907 --> 47:50.200
- Who the fuck is Marcus?

47:50.200 --> 47:52.077
- Doesn't even matter, I've got questions.

47:52.077 --> 47:54.663
- Well if you in my house, it matters.

47:54.663 --> 47:56.498
Tell you ain't a cop.

47:56.498 --> 47:57.332
Hey Kelly.

47:59.042 --> 48:02.796
- I'm sorry OG, this is
Marcus, he's new to the house.

48:02.796 --> 48:04.214
He doesn't know house rules yet.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.382
- What you mean house rules.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.884
- Yeah, little nigga, house rules.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.803
This is my house, and there
are rules up in this bitch.

48:09.803 --> 48:12.264
All right, let's try again.

48:12.264 --> 48:13.682
Who's Marcus?

48:13.682 --> 48:15.225
- Somebody who's got questions.

48:15.225 --> 48:16.059
- To what?

48:17.144 --> 48:17.978
- I want to know about the crew

48:17.978 --> 48:19.313
that robbed the bank on 25th.

48:20.772 --> 48:21.773
- House rules.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.610
So who you fighting?

48:24.610 --> 48:25.444
- What?

48:25.444 --> 48:26.486
- Who you fighting?

48:26.486 --> 48:28.322
- I didn't come here for a fucking fight.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.240
- Well you came here looking for one,

48:30.240 --> 48:32.576
plus if you want nay word on
the crew that rolled that bank,

48:32.576 --> 48:34.161
you'll be stepping in that ring.

48:36.246 --> 48:41.043
Listen here Marcus, in this
house people follow my rules.

48:41.043 --> 48:42.669
And if you wanna leave
here with your face intact,

48:42.669 --> 48:44.254
you'll be doing the same.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.089
So, who you fighting.

48:46.089 --> 48:46.924
- Doesn't matter.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.555
- All right, we have our winner Bear.

48:53.555 --> 48:54.973
Now don't forget to pay what you owe

48:54.973 --> 48:57.100
so I don't have to come
looking for your ass.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.227
And as always, house gets ten percent.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.104
All right motherfuckers,

49:01.104 --> 49:02.814
we got some fresh meat
coming to the stage.

49:02.814 --> 49:05.859
I'm pretty sure you'll all want
to give him a warm welcome.

49:05.859 --> 49:08.236
Marcus and his opponent Barnes.

49:13.116 --> 49:14.576
All right you two, keep it clean,

49:14.576 --> 49:15.827
keep your guard up at all times,

49:15.827 --> 49:18.664
but most importantly, let's
have some fun with this shit.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.501
- You're mine.

49:22.501 --> 49:23.710
- What are the rules?

49:23.710 --> 49:24.628
- Win.

49:24.628 --> 49:29.633
(dramatic music)
(audience yelling)

49:41.103 --> 49:42.396
- Fuck him up, yeah!

49:42.396 --> 49:47.401
(dramatic music)
(audience yelling)

50:35.032 --> 50:35.866
- Damn.

50:37.409 --> 50:39.453
I guess we have a winner.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.246
- Tell me what the fuck I need to know.

50:41.246 --> 50:42.372
- That was a hell of a fight.

50:42.372 --> 50:44.249
Somebody makes sure Barnes ain't dead

50:44.249 --> 50:45.959
and get him up off my stage.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.349
- Look, I got on your fucking little stage

51:01.349 --> 51:02.476
and I fought all right?

51:02.476 --> 51:04.061
Now I want some goddamn answers.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.479
- I can tell by the way you fought

51:05.479 --> 51:07.230
you're not a street fighter,
you're professional.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.274
We don't get those down here.

51:09.274 --> 51:11.068
- I need to know.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.528
- Was your family in that
bank that got robbed?

51:13.528 --> 51:15.113
Are you looking for revenge
against the robbers?

51:15.113 --> 51:16.656
- What I'm not seeking

51:16.656 --> 51:19.242
is a goddamn father figure, all right?

51:19.242 --> 51:20.660
Who the fuck was in the crew?

51:22.287 --> 51:24.289
- Calls himself Masaai.

51:24.289 --> 51:25.123
- Masaai?

51:25.123 --> 51:27.834
- Yeah, it was his crew
that rolled that bank.

51:27.834 --> 51:30.253
Word on the street is they
got ambushed by another gang.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.214
I don't know who that was,
I just know that a lot

51:32.214 --> 51:33.840
of folks were talking
about hitting that place.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.925
- How do I talk to Masaai?

51:34.925 --> 51:36.760
- There's no talking to Masaai,

51:36.760 --> 51:37.969
you have to be in his crew
to even get close to him.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.554
- Then how do I get in the fucking crew?

51:39.554 --> 51:41.056
- Boy, you must have a death wish.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.474
Masaai ain't the kind of guy you

51:42.474 --> 51:44.726
can just walk up to and
ask a couple of questions.

51:44.726 --> 51:47.479
He'll take you out even
if you're a professional.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.106
- Who here is in his crew?

51:49.106 --> 51:50.440
- There's a few.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.400
His right hand soilder used
to come around here a lot.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.485
- Who was that?

51:53.485 --> 51:56.905
- Cyrus, he got shot up by
another crew doing that heist.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.324
It's a shame too.

51:59.324 --> 52:03.411
He was a good soldier,
shit, he was a good man.

52:03.411 --> 52:05.539
Him and Kelly was a thing.

52:05.539 --> 52:06.373
Did You know him?

52:06.373 --> 52:07.749
- Anybody here from his crew?

52:09.918 --> 52:12.337
- Wait, wait, he talked about you.

52:12.337 --> 52:14.005
This isn't your life Marcus.

52:14.005 --> 52:14.923
If you take that step,

52:14.923 --> 52:16.675
it's gonna follow you for
the rest of your life.

52:16.675 --> 52:17.968
- Point out the guy.

52:21.847 --> 52:23.431
- Guy in the black raiders cap.

52:29.521 --> 52:30.522
- What's up?

52:32.566 --> 52:34.109
- You know, you're not
the usual down here.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.152
- Shit, I'm here now.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.904
- So what business you got with OG?

52:37.904 --> 52:39.072
- That old nigga?

52:42.534 --> 52:44.661
Look, I'm looking to join
the toughest crew around.

52:46.037 --> 52:47.581
- That's what's up, you got hands G.

52:47.581 --> 52:48.623
Shit the way you took out Barnes

52:48.623 --> 52:51.459
with the elbow, shit was dope.

52:51.459 --> 52:53.003
- Appreciate it.

52:53.003 --> 52:55.422
- We could use someone like you.

52:55.422 --> 52:56.381
- Who's in your crew.

52:56.381 --> 52:57.382
- No questions though.

52:57.382 --> 52:58.258
You down to ride?

52:59.843 --> 53:01.303
- Where we going?

53:01.303 --> 53:02.637
- Dog, are you down?

53:03.680 --> 53:05.557
- Yeah I'm down.

53:05.557 --> 53:06.975
- All right look, finish
kicking with your girl,

53:06.975 --> 53:08.018
enjoy a few fights.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.519
I'll come grab you in a
little bit, all right?

53:09.519 --> 53:10.353
- All right.

53:10.353 --> 53:11.188
- All right, sure.

53:18.570 --> 53:19.613
- Is everything okay?

53:21.406 --> 53:22.240
- Yeah.

53:23.200 --> 53:28.205
I found the dude that Cyrus was
rolling with and their crew.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.873
- That guy?

53:29.873 --> 53:31.249
- Mmhm.

53:31.249 --> 53:34.252
I'm rolling with them tonight.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.757
- Marcus, are you sure?

53:40.342 --> 53:42.719
I'm telling you this is not a game.

53:42.719 --> 53:45.847
- Cyrus always said I got to
step out eventually, right?

53:45.847 --> 53:48.642
But nah, I got it.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.894
You should head home, I got it.

53:50.894 --> 53:51.728
- Are you sure?

53:53.355 --> 53:54.606
- I'll be fine.

53:56.316 --> 53:57.150
- Marcus.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.070
Thank you.

54:02.489 --> 54:03.657
- I'll see you later.

54:03.657 --> 54:06.660
(suspenseful music)

54:29.474 --> 54:32.644
(gun firing)

54:32.644 --> 54:34.980
- Get out the car, get the fuck out.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.439
- Shit.

54:36.439 --> 54:37.274
- Nigga move.

54:51.663 --> 54:52.956
Who the fuck Samson think he is?

54:52.956 --> 54:54.708
Bringing these new niggas to the spot.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.002
See, that's why I had
to take care of his ass.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.671
What the fuck you doing
with Samsom anyways?

54:59.671 --> 55:00.505
- [Marcus] Just looking to join

55:00.505 --> 55:02.424
the toughest crew around, that's all.

55:02.424 --> 55:04.551
- [Man] Nigga, who are you?

55:04.551 --> 55:05.343
- Marcus.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.487
- What do you know about loyalty?

55:27.157 --> 55:28.325
- Allegiance and trust.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.749
- Trust is earned, respect is given,

55:36.708 --> 55:38.126
loyalty is demonstrated.

55:39.919 --> 55:41.671
Betrayal of any one of those.

55:45.383 --> 55:46.509
You lose all three.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.722
So you want to be apart of this?

55:52.015 --> 55:53.266
- Yeah.

55:53.266 --> 55:55.310
- You're gonna have to earn your loyalty.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.315
There's a liquor store
on tenth and Broadway.

56:01.274 --> 56:02.275
You're gonna rob it.

56:03.568 --> 56:07.614
At any given time, that place
holds onto about 15,000 cash.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.700
Bring it to me, all of it.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.079
You get it here, we can talk.

56:21.503 --> 56:23.630
If it's not here within 48 hours,

56:24.839 --> 56:27.425
I'll start killing everybody
on this fucking phone.

56:29.969 --> 56:31.888
I think you understand that.

56:31.888 --> 56:32.722
Right Marcus?

56:33.890 --> 56:34.724
- Yeah.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.650
- Nigga, what the fuck
you still doing here?

56:43.650 --> 56:44.484
Bounce!

56:45.985 --> 56:48.738
(dramatic music)

57:20.437 --> 57:21.312
- What's up Marcus?

57:21.312 --> 57:22.147
- Yo.

57:22.147 --> 57:23.773
- Damn man, what happened?

57:25.942 --> 57:27.569
- Got into some shit man.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.195
- Does this have anything
to do with that gang stuff

57:29.195 --> 57:31.072
you were talking about the other day?

57:31.072 --> 57:32.949
- Honestly man, I'd rather
not talk about it at work.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.409
Just stop by later on tonight

57:34.409 --> 57:35.577
and I'll tell you all about it.

57:35.577 --> 57:37.245
- Call the cops?

57:37.245 --> 57:38.705
- If only it was that simple.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.709
- Marcus, you got a sec?

57:42.709 --> 57:43.543
- Yes sir.

57:46.212 --> 57:47.922
- What happened to your face?

57:47.922 --> 57:50.967
- Oh, just kick boxing classes.

57:50.967 --> 57:53.178
- Well I hope you got a few
licks in on the other guy.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.679
- Absolutely.

57:54.679 --> 57:55.889
- Let's talk in my office.

57:55.889 --> 57:56.723
- Yes sir.

58:18.203 --> 58:21.456
- You've been doing very
well with this company Marcus

58:21.456 --> 58:24.459
and I'd like to thank
you for your hard work.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.044
- Thank you very much sir.

58:26.044 --> 58:29.797
- You're a strong leader, and
you're someone I can trust.

58:31.257 --> 58:34.219
Very loyal to the company with
the sacrifices you've made.

58:38.765 --> 58:41.726
I know you are aware we are expanding

58:41.726 --> 58:44.312
and we'll have a satellite
building down South.

58:46.981 --> 58:48.608
I would like you to run it.

58:52.862 --> 58:53.780
You okay with that?

58:55.198 --> 58:57.242
- Yeah, yes sir.

58:59.410 --> 59:01.538
- It will require some change.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.918
Are you okay with relocating?

59:08.253 --> 59:09.504
- Of course.

59:09.504 --> 59:10.713
- That's great.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.924
I actually want to send
you out tomorrow afternoon

59:12.924 --> 59:15.218
to Los Angeles to meet
with the head of marketing

59:15.218 --> 59:18.179
and go over some quarterly business plans.

59:18.179 --> 59:19.180
- Tomorrow you said?

59:21.391 --> 59:23.935
- Yes, tomorrow.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.687
Is that gonna be a problem?

59:27.230 --> 59:28.439
- Course not.

59:28.439 --> 59:29.274
- Okay.

59:30.858 --> 59:33.778
Marcus, I feel you will

59:33.778 --> 59:35.947
be the right person for the position.

59:37.490 --> 59:38.700
You have no attachments.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.618
You understand how to play the game,

59:40.618 --> 59:42.829
and that will get you far in this company.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.040
Don't let me down.

59:48.835 --> 59:49.669
- I won't sir.

59:50.587 --> 59:51.421
Excuse me.

1:00:16.738 --> 1:00:17.655
- You good?

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:21.701
- Yeah, I'm good.

1:00:26.122 --> 1:00:28.374
- Cyrus always had bruises on his face.

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:31.085
- Yeah.

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:36.591
Guess he has something to be
proud of me for now, right?

1:00:36.591 --> 1:00:38.468
- He was always talking about you.

1:00:41.721 --> 1:00:43.556
He was always talking about that obsession

1:00:43.556 --> 1:00:46.601
with that Dragon Ball Z
show y'all always watched.

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:50.229
- Anime, yeah.

1:00:50.229 --> 1:00:52.440
I'm honestly surprised
he even told you that.

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:55.276
- All the time.

1:00:57.904 --> 1:00:59.947
He was a good spirit.

1:01:02.158 --> 1:01:03.076
Just like Goku.

1:01:05.036 --> 1:01:05.870
- Yeah.

1:01:11.042 --> 1:01:12.335
- So did you hear about the people

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:13.961
that Cyrus was hanging out with?

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:20.677
- I don't think I can do it Kelly.

1:01:23.388 --> 1:01:24.222
- Do what?

1:01:26.933 --> 1:01:31.604
- They want me to rob a store
and I have 48 hours to do it,

1:01:31.604 --> 1:01:34.649
some sort of fucking initiation
or some shit like that.

1:01:35.566 --> 1:01:36.651
I don't know.

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:39.987
- And you told them no?

1:01:42.782 --> 1:01:44.534
- I don't think it works that way.

1:01:47.078 --> 1:01:51.708
They have my phone and
all my contacts in it.

1:01:54.585 --> 1:01:58.214
They, they said they'd start to kill

1:01:58.214 --> 1:02:00.133
everyone in my phone if I didn't do it.

1:02:01.801 --> 1:02:04.303
(Kelly sighs)

1:02:06.013 --> 1:02:07.390
- So what are you gonna do?

1:02:11.686 --> 1:02:12.562
- I don't know.

1:02:14.564 --> 1:02:16.566
My boss, he offered me a job in LA and

1:02:19.068 --> 1:02:20.862
I honestly just feel like taking it.

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:25.825
- A job?

1:02:31.205 --> 1:02:33.249
Is it front end, or back end programming?

1:02:36.127 --> 1:02:37.503
- How do you know that?

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:48.347
- Before I met Cyrus,
I was a web developer.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:53.019
I'm not just the girl that cusses you out.

1:02:56.564 --> 1:02:57.899
- What happened?

1:03:02.653 --> 1:03:03.488
- Well.

1:03:08.576 --> 1:03:09.869
I fell for Cyrus.

1:03:13.539 --> 1:03:17.043
And everything that comes with it.

1:03:20.254 --> 1:03:21.839
I chose family.

1:03:21.839 --> 1:03:24.592
(dramatic music)

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:39.190
- They have a list of all my
contact Kelly, and my phone.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:45.863
- It's okay Marcus.

1:03:48.783 --> 1:03:50.117
- It's not okay.

1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:52.870
You're in that contact list Kelly.

1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.791
(dramatic music)

1:04:09.679 --> 1:04:10.847
- Look Marcus.

1:04:13.516 --> 1:04:15.643
Do what you need to do, okay?

1:04:18.271 --> 1:04:23.276
You don't owe Cyrus or
me anything, all right?

1:04:26.988 --> 1:04:28.739
Cyrus would be proud of you.

1:04:31.742 --> 1:04:33.160
You know something?

1:04:35.329 --> 1:04:40.251
I guarantee he's looking down
right now, and still proud.

1:04:49.552 --> 1:04:51.470
- Man, this is too crazy.

1:04:52.638 --> 1:04:53.723
What are you gonna do?

1:04:54.807 --> 1:04:55.641
- I'm thinking.

1:04:57.894 --> 1:05:00.021
A lot just fucking happen man.

1:05:00.021 --> 1:05:01.272
- [Man] What about wearing a wire?

1:05:01.272 --> 1:05:02.315
- Fuck no.

1:05:06.152 --> 1:05:07.028
Shit.

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:07.862
- [Man] What?

1:05:09.572 --> 1:05:11.949
- Rodger offered me the position.

1:05:11.949 --> 1:05:13.910
- Holy shit, that's great!

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:14.952
You took it, right?

1:05:16.037 --> 1:05:17.204
- I don't know.

1:05:17.204 --> 1:05:18.831
He wants me to fly out tomorrow.

1:05:18.831 --> 1:05:22.001
- Well damn man, that's your way out.

1:05:22.001 --> 1:05:23.085
- It's not that easy man.

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:24.128
- Why?

1:05:24.128 --> 1:05:25.421
Because they have your phone?

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:26.297
You can go to the cops,

1:05:26.297 --> 1:05:27.924
they can track that thing,
and you can bust them.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:30.426
- It's because I still
don't know who killed Cyrus!

1:05:31.385 --> 1:05:35.014
And that doesn't even
guarantees Kelly's safety.

1:05:36.474 --> 1:05:39.727
- Look, Marcus don't take
this the wrong way man,

1:05:39.727 --> 1:05:42.146
but up until these last couple weeks,

1:05:42.146 --> 1:05:44.148
I barely even heard you
talk about your brother,

1:05:44.148 --> 1:05:46.317
and we worked together for five years.

1:05:51.405 --> 1:05:53.574
- I don't talk about Cyrus

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:57.662
because we took different paths in life.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.125
- We all got family members like that man.

1:06:04.126 --> 1:06:05.336
- We never knew our dad.

1:06:06.545 --> 1:06:08.005
Mom was strung out on drugs.

1:06:09.173 --> 1:06:10.967
In and out of fucking foster homes.

1:06:12.134 --> 1:06:13.469
My head would fucking spin.

1:06:15.346 --> 1:06:20.226
Cyrus, he was my fucking rock,
he was my fucking everything.

1:06:23.938 --> 1:06:25.564
He used to just keep us together,

1:06:26.565 --> 1:06:28.150
he tried to keep us together.

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:31.570
- [Man] I'm sorry to hear that man.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:38.244
- Over time I just
learned to block it out.

1:06:40.663 --> 1:06:41.497
You can get real good at blocking

1:06:41.497 --> 1:06:43.332
stuff out if you try hard enough.

1:06:45.918 --> 1:06:48.170
He was in jail, mom was,

1:06:48.170 --> 1:06:49.714
I don't know where the fuck mom was.

1:06:50.548 --> 1:06:51.507
Probably on drugs.

1:06:53.843 --> 1:06:55.636
And then one day, police knock

1:06:55.636 --> 1:06:57.304
on my door and tell me she's dead.

1:07:00.558 --> 1:07:02.560
I didn't even go to her fucking funeral.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:07.940
I just, I didn't even fucking care.

1:07:09.108 --> 1:07:11.235
I put my career in front of her,

1:07:11.235 --> 1:07:12.695
in front of my fucking family.

1:07:14.780 --> 1:07:15.865
I can't do that again.

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.118
Not with Cyrus.

1:07:20.786 --> 1:07:23.164
He deserves better, he deserves more.

1:07:25.583 --> 1:07:28.044
- Look man, I hear you, okay.

1:07:29.211 --> 1:07:32.757
This isn't some game, you're
into some serious shit.

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.052
So what are you going to do?

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:40.056
- I need to make 15,000 by tomorrow.

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:40.890
- Fuck.

1:07:42.183 --> 1:07:43.184
What about LA?

1:07:43.184 --> 1:07:44.018
- I can't.

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:48.355
If I'm gonna do this, I gotta be all in.

1:07:48.355 --> 1:07:49.899
Rodger can find somebody else.

1:07:49.899 --> 1:07:52.151
- [Man] So you're mind's made up?

1:07:52.151 --> 1:07:52.985
- Yeah.

1:07:54.278 --> 1:07:57.114
- Well, I mean you can't
dip into your stocks

1:07:57.114 --> 1:07:59.450
because it'll take at least a
week to get everything liquid.

1:07:59.450 --> 1:08:02.203
- Yeah, I need something fast,
I need something immediate.

1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:04.705
- Maybe you can sell your watch.

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:08.626
- That's not worth 15,000.

1:08:15.841 --> 1:08:17.343
I got it.

1:08:17.343 --> 1:08:18.176
- What?

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.223
- Craigslist.

1:08:23.224 --> 1:08:25.226
- What are you gonna sell on Craigslist?

1:08:27.603 --> 1:08:29.313
- You got your phone on you, right?

1:08:29.313 --> 1:08:30.147
- Yeah.

1:08:32.108 --> 1:08:33.776
- I need you to take
some photos of my car.

1:08:37.655 --> 1:08:38.488
15,000.

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:44.327
(tense music)

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:50.709
- Good shit, take a seat.

1:08:57.299 --> 1:09:01.428
So, why do you want to be apart of this?

1:09:01.428 --> 1:09:02.971
- I'm looking to join a family.

1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:07.059
- [Masaai] So you don't
have any family out here?

1:09:08.434 --> 1:09:09.270
- No.

1:09:11.689 --> 1:09:14.191
- Do you know why I had
you rob that liquor store?

1:09:16.318 --> 1:09:17.153
- Initiation.

1:09:18.737 --> 1:09:19.737
- Trust.

1:09:21.532 --> 1:09:23.325
We do things to preserve the trust

1:09:23.325 --> 1:09:25.619
in the group, in the family.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:29.039
Now you want to be apart of that family?

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:31.375
- Yes sir.

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:32.376
- Don't call me sir.

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:36.212
We got some big things
getting ready to happen.

1:09:37.673 --> 1:09:40.800
If you're apart of this, it's all the way.

1:09:41.635 --> 1:09:43.762
No half ass shit.

1:09:43.762 --> 1:09:44.596
- I'm in.

1:09:45.681 --> 1:09:48.184
(tense music)

1:10:00.070 --> 1:10:02.573
You can hold onto that for me.

1:10:03.824 --> 1:10:04.657
- That's good.

1:10:07.286 --> 1:10:12.291
- Honestly, I need to make
more money, 15K isn't enough.

1:10:14.251 --> 1:10:15.460
- [Masaai] I hear you.

1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:19.340
Like I said, we have somethings
coming down the pipe line.

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:24.178
- What about like, like banks.

1:10:25.346 --> 1:10:26.347
- What about banks?

1:10:27.598 --> 1:10:28.849
- You know, anything I need

1:10:28.849 --> 1:10:32.144
to look out for if I end up robbing one?

1:10:32.144 --> 1:10:32.978
- For what?

1:10:35.439 --> 1:10:38.692
- Couple weeks ago there was
a bank heist on the news.

1:10:39.985 --> 1:10:43.364
Cats who robbed the spot got shot.

1:10:43.364 --> 1:10:44.949
Samson said it was one of y'all.

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:48.494
- Yeah, shit happens.

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:50.371
- I mean like what kind of shit?

1:10:50.371 --> 1:10:51.455
Street shit?

1:10:51.455 --> 1:10:53.249
- You worried about beef?

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:56.377
- No, I'm just saying,
looking out for myself.

1:10:56.377 --> 1:11:01.382
- The only nigga you need
to watch out for is me.

1:11:06.219 --> 1:11:09.348
Samson saw you down at
the underground fights.

1:11:09.348 --> 1:11:10.891
- Yeah.

1:11:10.891 --> 1:11:12.851
- [Masaai] What do you
think about that place?

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:15.478
- It's cool, why?

1:11:17.189 --> 1:11:19.692
- There's a lot of money
going through that place.

1:11:21.235 --> 1:11:22.068
- Okay.

1:11:22.945 --> 1:11:24.530
- It's a protected place.

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:28.117
- What do you mean protected?

1:11:30.494 --> 1:11:32.663
- Kind of a truce between gangs,

1:11:32.663 --> 1:11:35.958
to keep businesses running
smoothly from city to city.

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:37.710
- [Marcus] And the cops
don't know about it?

1:11:37.710 --> 1:11:38.877
- Know about it?

1:11:38.877 --> 1:11:40.963
Shit, it was their idea.

1:11:42.673 --> 1:11:44.675
- Why the underground fights?

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:46.593
- Because pigs find it entertaining.

1:11:48.594 --> 1:11:49.596
You met OG?

1:11:49.596 --> 1:11:50.723
- Yeah, I met him.

1:11:52.391 --> 1:11:53.225
- A dirty cop.

1:11:54.727 --> 1:11:56.353
He's the reason why two of my soldiers

1:11:56.353 --> 1:11:58.105
got hit during that bank heist.

1:12:00.733 --> 1:12:02.151
- You telling me OG's a cop?

1:12:03.443 --> 1:12:05.529
- OG orchestrated a hit that

1:12:05.529 --> 1:12:08.824
put my soldiers Cyrus
and Killah in harms way.

1:12:10.451 --> 1:12:12.995
Them pigs been trying to
get at me for the longest.

1:12:15.748 --> 1:12:17.750
- Why you ain't done nothing about it?

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:18.584
- OG?

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:21.795
That's what you're for.

1:12:21.795 --> 1:12:23.339
I'm sending you and a couple

1:12:23.339 --> 1:12:25.799
of soldiers over there to
take care of that place.

1:12:31.930 --> 1:12:32.764
- No disrespect Masaai,

1:12:32.764 --> 1:12:34.725
but I feel like that's a little much

1:12:34.725 --> 1:12:36.184
to put on my shoulders, don't you think?

1:12:36.184 --> 1:12:38.437
- This is called trust.

1:12:38.437 --> 1:12:40.105
Look at it as your initiation.

1:12:41.815 --> 1:12:45.193
Besides, if you don't do
it, you're dead anyway.

1:12:48.947 --> 1:12:50.240
- Okay.

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:51.742
When are we going?

1:12:51.742 --> 1:12:53.160
- Right now.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.662
(tense music)

1:13:00.541 --> 1:13:01.877
What's it gonna be?

1:13:01.877 --> 1:13:04.380
(tense music)

1:13:09.300 --> 1:13:11.303
You got a problem with this?

1:13:11.303 --> 1:13:12.137
- Not at all.

1:13:13.305 --> 1:13:16.225
- This is for Killah, and Cyrus.

1:13:17.684 --> 1:13:19.061
Our family.

1:13:19.061 --> 1:13:19.895
- Yeah.

1:13:19.895 --> 1:13:22.898
(people chattering)

1:13:29.655 --> 1:13:31.573
- Take this to the coffee shop on 16th,

1:13:31.573 --> 1:13:32.950
let them know it's from me.

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:36.912
- Get the fuck down!

1:13:36.912 --> 1:13:39.915
(suspenseful music)

1:13:46.130 --> 1:13:48.674
(whacks)

1:13:48.674 --> 1:13:49.675
Get up, get up!

1:13:51.593 --> 1:13:52.428
Get up!

1:13:54.179 --> 1:13:55.431
So you a cop?

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:56.264
- What?

1:13:56.264 --> 1:13:57.099
- So you're a cop!

1:13:57.099 --> 1:13:58.183
- Yeah, yeah I'm a cop.

1:13:58.183 --> 1:14:00.602
Look, just take the money,
I won't tell anyone.

1:14:00.602 --> 1:14:02.728
- So you set up the robbery huh?

1:14:02.728 --> 1:14:03.814
You set up the ambush.

1:14:07.067 --> 1:14:09.193
- What are you talking about?

1:14:09.193 --> 1:14:10.028
Marcus?

1:14:10.946 --> 1:14:11.905
Marcus this isn't you.

1:14:11.905 --> 1:14:13.532
- There ain't no fucking Marcus here.

1:14:13.532 --> 1:14:14.532
- I know it's you, I can tell

1:14:14.532 --> 1:14:16.869
by the way you fight, the way you move.

1:14:18.245 --> 1:14:20.414
- Why'd you set up the ambush?

1:14:20.414 --> 1:14:23.791
- Marcus, you're a good
person, just put the gun down.

1:14:23.791 --> 1:14:25.377
- You got Cyrus killed.

1:14:25.377 --> 1:14:26.335
- I didn't get your brother killed,

1:14:26.335 --> 1:14:28.005
I swear, I didn't set up a hit.

1:14:28.005 --> 1:14:29.840
- You know something!

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:30.924
That's what you do right?

1:14:30.924 --> 1:14:32.050
You know everything!

1:14:32.050 --> 1:14:34.803
(dramatic music)

1:14:35.888 --> 1:14:37.389
(gun fires)

1:14:37.389 --> 1:14:40.142
(dramatic music)

1:14:45.981 --> 1:14:47.691
- Man, fuck that pig.

1:14:47.691 --> 1:14:49.318
You good?

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:50.736
- Yeah, I'm good.

1:14:54.448 --> 1:14:56.032
- Nigga, where you get that at?

1:14:57.993 --> 1:14:59.369
- It's my moms.

1:14:59.369 --> 1:15:01.871
(tense music)

1:15:08.128 --> 1:15:10.630
(tense music)

1:15:17.054 --> 1:15:18.347
- That's good shit Marcus.

1:15:20.682 --> 1:15:24.645
Now that we got the eyes
of the streets out the way,

1:15:24.645 --> 1:15:26.897
we can put the real plan into effect.

1:15:28.148 --> 1:15:28.982
Get over here.

1:15:32.318 --> 1:15:36.114
This right here, is gonna
be our biggest pay day,

1:15:37.199 --> 1:15:38.867
I'm talking about millions.

1:15:38.867 --> 1:15:40.410
(men chuckling)

1:15:40.410 --> 1:15:41.202
- Yes sir.

1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:46.041
- I was reached by someone
high up in the cartel.

1:15:46.916 --> 1:15:50.796
They got a job for us, a little catch

1:15:50.796 --> 1:15:55.800
and release with the
mayors daughter, Danielle.

1:15:59.596 --> 1:16:01.181
OG almost got in the way.

1:16:02.516 --> 1:16:04.476
He had his ears to the street,

1:16:04.476 --> 1:16:06.019
and he was a piece of the puzzle

1:16:06.019 --> 1:16:07.521
that needed to be taken out.

1:16:08.689 --> 1:16:09.982
Right on Marcus.

1:16:11.942 --> 1:16:14.903
- A little pay back for Cyrus and Killah.

1:16:14.903 --> 1:16:17.447
- Fuck Killah and Cyrus.

1:16:19.992 --> 1:16:24.996
Danielle is usually at the
coffee shop, on Geary and Vaness.

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:26.456
She gets there around eight o'clock

1:16:26.456 --> 1:16:28.041
to meet up with her boyfriend.

1:16:29.209 --> 1:16:31.003
Her dad doesn't know about it.

1:16:31.003 --> 1:16:32.254
- But we do.

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:34.130
(man laughs)

1:16:34.130 --> 1:16:38.050
- Right here, gonna have two
soldiers posted up in a van.

1:16:38.050 --> 1:16:40.596
Then we get out, snatch her ass up,

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:42.598
and don't worry about wearing a mask,

1:16:42.598 --> 1:16:45.183
we have all the cameras
down across the block.

1:16:47.311 --> 1:16:49.396
From there we take her
little ass over here,

1:16:49.396 --> 1:16:53.817
we escort her to this spot
where there is a tunnel

1:16:53.817 --> 1:16:56.903
to get her ass out the city,
possibly out of the country.

1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:02.826
- That looks like, looks like OG's spot.

1:17:02.826 --> 1:17:04.620
- Yeah, the cartel wants it.

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:08.123
So they could have access
points throughout the city.

1:17:11.126 --> 1:17:12.878
There should be some rope here.

1:17:12.878 --> 1:17:14.880
Tie her ass up, and all you gotta do

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.757
is put her down that hole.

1:17:16.757 --> 1:17:18.967
Once she hits the bottom, oh she's gone.

1:17:18.967 --> 1:17:20.594
- [Man] Get the fuck out of here.

1:17:22.763 --> 1:17:24.723
- And our job is done.

1:17:24.723 --> 1:17:26.850
And we'll be some rich motherfuckers.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:27.726
- [Man] Hell yeah.

1:17:29.770 --> 1:17:31.228
- This is going out tomorrow night.

1:17:31.228 --> 1:17:32.064
Get ready.

1:17:32.981 --> 1:17:34.566
You ready for tomorrow?

1:17:34.566 --> 1:17:36.943
- Hey Masaai, can I
talk to you real quick?

1:17:36.943 --> 1:17:39.946
(suspenseful music)

1:17:46.702 --> 1:17:48.538
- What's on your mind?

1:17:50.791 --> 1:17:51.958
- I killed a man today.

1:17:53.210 --> 1:17:56.963
- That was necessary, to put
the family's plan into action.

1:17:58.715 --> 1:18:01.300
- Plans, What else was part of the plan?

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:02.803
Cyrus and Killah?

1:18:04.513 --> 1:18:06.682
I thought that was your family.

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:08.100
- Yeah they were.

1:18:08.100 --> 1:18:10.059
It's a dirty game Marcus.

1:18:11.895 --> 1:18:13.105
Somebody got to win it.

1:18:15.357 --> 1:18:16.400
Pick up that money.

1:18:17.359 --> 1:18:18.652
Go make a girl happy.

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:22.030
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:18:22.030 --> 1:18:24.532
(tense music)

1:18:38.797 --> 1:18:40.215
- Look, man, we got to talk.

1:18:46.263 --> 1:18:48.432
- Still can't believe
that OG set up Cyrus.

1:18:50.058 --> 1:18:51.476
He was like a father figure.

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:57.566
- I killed him.

1:18:58.650 --> 1:19:00.693
I killed a fucking cop.

1:19:00.693 --> 1:19:02.446
- A dirty cop Marcus.

1:19:03.572 --> 1:19:05.824
- One that got Cyrus shot.

1:19:09.952 --> 1:19:11.037
- Are you fucking happy

1:19:11.037 --> 1:19:11.871
- What?

1:19:13.123 --> 1:19:14.458
- Are you fucking happy?

1:19:16.501 --> 1:19:19.588
We found out who killed
Cyrus, are you fucking happy?

1:19:19.588 --> 1:19:21.840
- What the hell are you
talking about Marcus?

1:19:23.759 --> 1:19:28.305
- I lost my fucking job, sold
my car, joined a goddamn gang!

1:19:30.432 --> 1:19:31.641
And I killed a fucking cop!

1:19:31.641 --> 1:19:33.602
- Are you fucking serious Marcus?

1:19:34.478 --> 1:19:35.395
Your job?

1:19:38.482 --> 1:19:43.068
I lost my fiance, my baby's father.

1:19:45.071 --> 1:19:45.906
Look at me.

1:19:47.782 --> 1:19:51.202
Your brother, your blood Marcus.

1:19:55.332 --> 1:19:57.083
You're worried about your damn job.

1:20:08.804 --> 1:20:11.181
- I just don't get it.

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:12.849
What the fuck is Cyrus doing, why the fuck

1:20:12.849 --> 1:20:15.393
wass he giving his money to
these God damn criminals?

1:20:19.815 --> 1:20:21.691
- You really didn't know your brother.

1:20:25.821 --> 1:20:28.240
He wasn't giving his
money to the gangs Marcus.

1:20:39.125 --> 1:20:40.627
I wanna show you something.

1:20:40.627 --> 1:20:43.380
(dramatic music)

1:21:55.368 --> 1:21:57.871
(gate clangs)

1:22:03.168 --> 1:22:05.754
Cyrus was always talking
about how he wanted

1:22:05.754 --> 1:22:08.089
to give back to the kids
who really needed it.

1:22:12.677 --> 1:22:14.471
He wanted you to see this Marcus,

1:22:16.514 --> 1:22:18.058
he wanted you to be apart of it.

1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:21.853
(dramatic music)

1:22:25.273 --> 1:22:26.483
- [Marcus] I never knew.

1:22:31.529 --> 1:22:34.032
(door knocks)

1:22:36.368 --> 1:22:38.202
(door clicks)

1:22:38.202 --> 1:22:40.163
- Hey Kelly, how you doing?

1:22:40.163 --> 1:22:40.996
- Teisha.

1:22:40.996 --> 1:22:41.831
It is good to see you.

1:22:41.831 --> 1:22:43.166
- It's good to see you to.

1:22:45.043 --> 1:22:46.585
- This is Marcus.

1:22:46.585 --> 1:22:48.797
- Oh, hi Marcus, nice to finally meet you.

1:22:48.797 --> 1:22:51.174
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1:22:51.174 --> 1:22:52.800
Come on in.

1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:53.843
- Thank you Teisha.

1:22:55.719 --> 1:22:57.305
I wanted to bring Marcus over here

1:22:57.305 --> 1:22:59.516
and show him how much this foundation

1:22:59.516 --> 1:23:01.101
has helped these kids lives.

1:23:02.143 --> 1:23:04.478
- Yeah, this is something
like a foster care,

1:23:04.478 --> 1:23:06.773
but our main focus is to keep

1:23:06.773 --> 1:23:09.317
brothers and sisters
together on this journey.

1:23:10.151 --> 1:23:11.027
- A foster home.

1:23:11.945 --> 1:23:15.115
- There's a lot of families
that fall on hard luck,

1:23:15.115 --> 1:23:18.076
and the government, they try to help but.

1:23:19.411 --> 1:23:23.123
Sometimes they take away
the most important thing

1:23:23.123 --> 1:23:25.791
that a kid has after
they lost their parents.

1:23:26.918 --> 1:23:28.294
They take away their blood.

1:24:02.245 --> 1:24:03.580
- No, thank you.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:11.921
- I didn't know anything about him.

1:24:13.882 --> 1:24:15.467
- It's okay Marcus.

1:24:15.467 --> 1:24:18.887
- No, no, I didn't know anything.

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:19.971
- Marcus.

1:24:21.347 --> 1:24:22.849
- I should have been there for him.

1:24:24.059 --> 1:24:28.396
- No, Marcus, Cyrus was getting paranoid.

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:33.568
- Paranoid about what?

1:24:33.568 --> 1:24:36.696
- I don't know, he just kept coming home

1:24:36.696 --> 1:24:39.074
and saying that he wasn't loyal,

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:43.036
and I don't know, it just kept,
it all caught up with him.

1:24:43.036 --> 1:24:43.870
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:24:43.870 --> 1:24:44.954
Loyal about what though?

1:24:46.289 --> 1:24:48.833
- I don't know, he kept saying that

1:24:48.833 --> 1:24:51.710
his loyalty was being
questioned by the group.

1:24:51.710 --> 1:24:54.714
(suspenseful music)

1:24:56.257 --> 1:24:57.092
Marcus?

1:24:59.969 --> 1:25:01.930
What's going on.

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:03.139
- Look, what I'm gonna tell
you right now is gonna be

1:25:03.139 --> 1:25:05.892
very important, so I need
you to listen to me, okay?

1:25:05.892 --> 1:25:06.934
Call the police in two hours,

1:25:06.934 --> 1:25:08.770
tell them I'll be at this address,

1:25:08.770 --> 1:25:10.396
tell them there's guns, drugs,

1:25:10.396 --> 1:25:12.190
and the gang leader Masaai, okay?

1:25:13.650 --> 1:25:14.484
I need your keys.

1:25:16.528 --> 1:25:18.487
Kelly please, I need your keys.

1:25:20.865 --> 1:25:21.699
- Marcus.

1:25:22.951 --> 1:25:24.119
- Please.

1:25:24.119 --> 1:25:27.121
(suspenseful music)

1:25:31.209 --> 1:25:32.627
- Fine.

1:25:32.627 --> 1:25:33.710
What are you gonna do?

1:25:35.588 --> 1:25:37.507
- I'm gonna make sure he stays there.

1:25:37.507 --> 1:25:40.969
(suspenseful music)

1:25:40.969 --> 1:25:42.303
(door clicks)

1:25:42.303 --> 1:25:45.306
(suspenseful music)

1:26:00.822 --> 1:26:01.990
- Marcus Sims.

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.702
There's no one in here but us.

1:26:08.913 --> 1:26:10.915
- [Marcus] So you got Cyrus killed, huh?

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:13.751
- Your brother.

1:26:13.751 --> 1:26:16.212
I had a couple of guys look into you

1:26:16.212 --> 1:26:18.505
because they saw you
wearing Cyrus's chain.

1:26:20.633 --> 1:26:23.969
A white collar nigga playing gangster.

1:26:25.263 --> 1:26:27.389
- Why'd you do it Masaai?

1:26:27.389 --> 1:26:29.058
- All I have is loyalty.

1:26:30.393 --> 1:26:32.437
I found out he was keeping money from me.

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.567
- So your own people ain't even safe, huh?

1:26:38.484 --> 1:26:41.446
(suspenseful music)

1:26:43.531 --> 1:26:44.907
- Like I told you,

1:26:44.907 --> 1:26:48.202
the only nigga you need
to worry about is me.

1:26:51.289 --> 1:26:52.665
That shit won't work.

1:26:52.665 --> 1:26:55.585
(suspenseful music)

1:26:55.585 --> 1:26:56.794
(Marcus thuds)

1:26:56.794 --> 1:26:58.671
You uncle Tom ass nigga.

1:26:58.671 --> 1:27:01.674
(suspenseful music)

1:27:02.675 --> 1:27:04.469
Oh you want to feel the struggle

1:27:04.469 --> 1:27:07.222
(dramatic music)

1:27:10.642 --> 1:27:12.936
(gate rattles)

1:27:12.936 --> 1:27:15.688
(dramatic music)

1:27:17.398 --> 1:27:19.651
(whacking)

1:27:21.236 --> 1:27:23.987

1:27:29.327 --> 1:27:31.913

1:27:34.582 --> 1:27:37.502
(Marcus cries out)

1:27:39.337 --> 1:27:44.342
(whacking)
(crying out)

1:27:44.759 --> 1:27:47.762
(suspenseful music)

1:27:52.433 --> 1:27:57.438
(Masaai cries out)
(dramatic music)

1:28:00.316 --> 1:28:03.068
(dramatic music)

1:28:17.041 --> 1:28:18.918
Family is nothing without loyalty!

1:28:18.918 --> 1:28:23.923
(dramatic music)
(whacking)

1:28:26.592 --> 1:28:29.344
(dramatic music)

1:28:33.433 --> 1:28:36.019
(gun fires)

1:28:36.019 --> 1:28:38.771

1:28:43.067 --> 1:28:45.778
(sirens blaring)

1:28:50.450 --> 1:28:55.455
(Marcus crying out)
(sirens blaring)

1:29:01.878 --> 1:29:05.005
Fuck you, you're nothing like us.

1:29:05.005 --> 1:29:07.800
You're a pussy, just like your brother.

1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:10.469
- They're coming for you.

1:29:10.469 --> 1:29:12.764
- Just fucking kill me.

1:29:12.764 --> 1:29:13.848
Fucking kill me.

1:29:13.848 --> 1:29:16.601
(dramatic music)

1:29:17.602 --> 1:29:18.936
Fucking kill me!

1:29:20.103 --> 1:29:23.733
- You're right Masaai,
I'm nothing like you.

1:29:27.445 --> 1:29:28.279
- Kill me!

1:29:32.200 --> 1:29:33.618
(gun clatters)

1:29:33.618 --> 1:29:35.787
- I won't give you the satisfaction.

1:29:35.787 --> 1:29:37.621
Of being with my brother.

1:29:38.956 --> 1:29:41.209
(dramatic music)
(sirens whirring)

1:29:41.209 --> 1:29:42.085
- [Masaai] No.

1:29:42.085 --> 1:29:47.090
(dramatic music)
(sirens blaring)

1:30:12.865 --> 1:30:17.829
(Marcus grunting)
(dramatic music)

1:30:54.073 --> 1:30:56.826
(dramatic music)

1:31:40.536 --> 1:31:42.538
- [Phone] 911, what's your emergency?

1:31:42.538 --> 1:31:43.371
- [Marcus] Yeah, the mayors daughter,

1:31:43.371 --> 1:31:44.999
she's just been kidnapped.

1:31:44.999 --> 1:31:47.126
She's been thrown in the back of a van.

1:31:47.126 --> 1:31:49.170
- [Phone] What's your location sir?

1:31:49.170 --> 1:31:51.797
- I'm at the corner of Geary and Vaness,

1:31:51.797 --> 1:31:53.466
in front of a coffee shop.

1:31:53.466 --> 1:31:55.343
- [Phone] Can you identify who
grabbed the mayors daughter?

1:31:55.343 --> 1:31:57.469
- No, I don't know who grabbed her.

1:31:57.469 --> 1:31:58.429
- [Phone] What about a license plate,

1:31:58.429 --> 1:31:59.263
did you happen to see that?

1:31:59.263 --> 1:32:01.307
- I didn't see the, I didn't see

1:32:01.307 --> 1:32:02.934
the license plate number, all right?

1:32:02.934 --> 1:32:05.561
- [Phone] Okay sir, I'm
gonna need you to calm down.

1:32:05.561 --> 1:32:07.522
- But I do have an idea
where's she's going.

1:32:07.522 --> 1:32:09.523
- [Phone] How do you know
this information sir?

1:32:09.523 --> 1:32:11.025
- Just listen!

1:32:11.025 --> 1:32:12.235
All right?

1:32:12.235 --> 1:32:14.320
- [Man] Okay, if I can
have you calm down sir,

1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:15.696
what's your name?

1:32:15.696 --> 1:32:17.949
- There's a warehouse on the docks.

1:32:17.949 --> 1:32:19.367
- [Phone] And where is this sir?

1:32:19.367 --> 1:32:20.201
- Seventh and Green.

1:32:20.201 --> 1:32:21.577
- [Phone] And to make sure
this isn't a prank call

1:32:21.577 --> 1:32:24.413
and we don't send units out
there, what's your name?

1:32:25.706 --> 1:32:27.208
- Just show up.

1:32:27.208 --> 1:32:29.960
(dramatic music)

1:32:39.262 --> 1:32:40.596
- Come on, move.

1:32:41.681 --> 1:32:44.433
(dramatic music)

1:32:49.605 --> 1:32:53.526
(speaking in foreign language)

1:32:56.237 --> 1:32:58.948
- You don't want to
damage the merchandise.

1:33:06.539 --> 1:33:07.707
You're so pretty.

1:33:08.874 --> 1:33:11.502
You're going to be very popular.

1:33:15.505 --> 1:33:18.259
(dramatic music)

1:33:25.057 --> 1:33:27.059
(Danielle cries out)

1:33:27.059 --> 1:33:29.812
(dramatic music)

1:33:41.282 --> 1:33:46.287
(train tracks ringing)
(dramatic music)

1:34:05.806 --> 1:34:07.725
(dramatic music)
(whacking)

1:34:07.725 --> 1:34:10.478
(dramatic music)

1:34:14.315 --> 1:34:19.320
(dramatic music)
(whacking)

1:36:16.937 --> 1:36:19.273
(gun fires)

1:36:30.493 --> 1:36:32.161
(door bangs)

1:36:32.161 --> 1:36:33.579
- Get down, get down!

1:36:33.579 --> 1:36:38.584
(sirens blaring)
(dramatic music)

1:36:53.098 --> 1:36:55.851
(dramatic music)

1:37:42.690 --> 1:37:43.732
- [Marcus] I want to start off

1:37:43.732 --> 1:37:46.235
by saying thank you for everything.

1:37:48.237 --> 1:37:49.112
Thank you for letting me see

1:37:49.112 --> 1:37:51.740
my brother for who he really was.

1:37:53.784 --> 1:37:54.618
Who he became.

1:37:56.452 --> 1:37:59.039
It's a shame that I didn't
see it until he was gone.

1:38:01.250 --> 1:38:03.002
I finally understand what he meant.

1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:05.796
I'm not doing this for me.

1:38:08.090 --> 1:38:09.800
I felt like I didn't have any family,

1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:13.012
that I was taking on this world alone.

1:38:15.014 --> 1:38:18.684
Even when I was blinded, Cyrus was there.

1:38:20.311 --> 1:38:22.771
I can never give my niece
or nephew their father

1:38:22.771 --> 1:38:26.233
but what I can give them is something

1:38:26.233 --> 1:38:31.237
me and Cyrus never had, a better start.

1:38:31.739 --> 1:38:34.491
(dramatic music)

1:38:49.505 --> 1:38:50.299
In the envelope on the table

1:38:50.299 --> 1:38:51.133
I signed everything over to you.

1:38:57.514 --> 1:39:01.018
I don't know what the future holds for me.

1:39:02.311 --> 1:39:05.147
But I know it finally feels right.

1:39:07.650 --> 1:39:10.402
(dramatic music)

1:39:25.041 --> 1:39:27.795
(dramatic music)

1:40:36.739 --> 1:40:39.491
(dramatic music)
