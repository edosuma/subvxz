WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.671
The idea that Microsoft could ever
compete with Sony or Nintendo...

00:04.755 --> 00:07.216
Microsoft is going to make a game console?

00:07.299 --> 00:08.425
It was seen as a bit of a joke.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.469
Might as well call it "Nerd Box" right?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.679
We needed to prove our credibility.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.807
This thing is going to be the most
badass thing you can imagine.

00:17.768 --> 00:21.271
Dude, we need a metal X
and it's gotta have a green eye,

00:21.355 --> 00:23.023
you know, shooting a laser out.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.525
I want it to blind people.

00:25.984 --> 00:30.072
Game developers are not gonna be
tolerant of any level of at all.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.115
I opened up the first machine,

00:32.199 --> 00:35.786
like, what the f... Oh my God,
like what happened in there?

00:36.662 --> 00:39.665
Seamus is backstage soldering

00:39.748 --> 00:41.166
as the auditorium is filling up.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.294
And it's in front of the boss!
The boss is coming on.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.381
The Microsoft brand is on the line.
The Microsoft name's on the line.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.799
Bill's not gonna be happy.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.217
And it was terrifying.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.344
He's screaming at us,
"You guys have lied to me,

00:52.427 --> 00:54.221
you guys have like played me for a fool."

00:54.304 --> 00:56.807
He says, "This is a insult

00:56.890 --> 00:59.059
to everything I've accomplished
at this company."

01:00.394 --> 01:02.855
It was terrifying.
I thought my career was over.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.609
There's a new contender
in the video game wars.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.528
Xbox is going to be the future.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.572
Truly the future of video games.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.824
Xbox.
Taking over the living room.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.701
Limitless, connected
digital entertainment.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.661
You guys never understood.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.454
The company is going
to face fierce competition.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.081
Sniper! Nooo!

01:21.164 --> 01:22.708
It's a ticking time bomb.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.543
It makes me very nervous
to actually play this for you.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.712
Xbox, getting a major overhaul.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.298
A bold vision for the future of gaming.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.175
It's the Xboooooooooooox!

01:42.936 --> 01:45.147
Meet the Microsoft mouse line.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.398
There's a mouse for everyone,

01:46.481 --> 01:48.734
whether you're an expert
or a first-time buyer.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.736
Let's start with the basics.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.823
I joined the hardware group back in 1987.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.658
I ran it for 13 years,

01:56.867 --> 01:59.203
hired 300 people into the group

01:59.286 --> 02:03.373
and by 1999 we were doing 600 million
dollars' worth of business a year.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.418
Rick was working for me
running our hardware business,

02:06.502 --> 02:08.253
think mice, keyboards,
we had some speakers.

02:08.337 --> 02:09.796
We had this thing called
Interactive Barney.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.008
That's super-de-duper!

02:13.091 --> 02:15.594
At some point
Steve Ballmer shows up and says,

02:15.677 --> 02:17.387
"Rick's gonna go do
this business exploration.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.474
I want you to help sort
of supervise and support him."

02:21.517 --> 02:24.895
Steve Ballmer tells me
Xbox is my new job

02:24.978 --> 02:26.647
and is very convincing about it.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.982
Having been in hardware
all of my career at Microsoft,

02:29.066 --> 02:32.110
I need to understand how this
is going to be a good business for us.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.071
Do you ever want to make hardware?

02:34.154 --> 02:38.200
If you want to be a great software company
you have to be only a software company.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.244
You can't dabble in in other things.

02:40.327 --> 02:44.081
The idea
of building a game console from scratch.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.250
The risk here was enormous.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.962
We really understand
what it is to be gamers,

02:50.045 --> 02:54.508
but we're panicking, like we have
to figure out how to build the hardware.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.593
We had no idea what we were doing.

02:56.677 --> 03:01.223
None, like couldn't have been less
qualified to build a console.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.476
Everything about making a console is hard.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.522
Including taking
an upfront loss on the hardware.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.235
Sony, Sega and Nintendo,
they design their own hardware.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.153
They manufacture it themselves

03:15.737 --> 03:19.449
and they sell it at a loss
and make a profit on games.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.951
That's how the business model works.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.454
So for Microsoft, that is
an insane business to get into.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.124
Our P&L said we
were gonna lose 2 billion dollars

03:27.207 --> 03:29.293
for the privilege of maybe later on

03:29.376 --> 03:30.878
somewhere way down the road
we'll make money.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.381
And once you started it
with all the commitments that you make

03:34.464 --> 03:37.885
trying to convince the game developers
to make Xbox games,

03:37.968 --> 03:39.386
you can't really stop it.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.640
What have you done?
What madness has claimed you?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.685
We made it a point
to Steve Ballmer to say,

03:46.768 --> 03:47.936
"If you guys start this thing,

03:48.020 --> 03:50.439
don't come back six months
from now and say it hurts too much."

03:53.400 --> 03:56.820
Any new console hoping
to have even a chance of success

03:56.904 --> 04:00.157
needed to win over a group
of notoriously tough critics...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
Game developers.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.619
And getting past those gatekeepers

04:03.702 --> 04:06.455
would require Microsoft
to make a flawless debut

04:06.538 --> 04:10.375
at the world's largest
game developer conference, GDC.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.419
Games sell consoles.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.213
And so in order to sell consoles,

04:14.296 --> 04:17.674
we had to win the hearts
and minds of the developers.

04:17.758 --> 04:23.055
The only place I think we
could have ever announced Xbox was GDC.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.350
The next GDC
would take place in March of 2000,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.977
so the Xbox team had only 11 months

04:29.061 --> 04:31.730
to design
and deliver a functioning prototype.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.067
Time is running out
for Microsoft to get on the board.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.486
If they didn't announce by GDC 2000,

04:37.569 --> 04:40.739
they were going to be ceding
too much of the playing field to Sony.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.949
They had to do it.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.160
And there was still
one massive problem to solve.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.996
Who was going
to build the console hardware?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.582
The plan had
never been for Microsoft to do it alone.

04:50.666 --> 04:55.045
The only way that we could actually get
Xbox made properly

04:55.128 --> 04:57.214
was to go to the people that were
really good at building hardware.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.801
Rick was trying like hell
to find somebody to partner with us,

05:00.884 --> 05:03.095
people who had expertise
that he knew we didn't have.

05:03.178 --> 05:06.265
Companies like Dell
and Compaq and NEC and Toshiba.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.518
We'd start these meetings and most
of the guys would look at me and go,

05:09.601 --> 05:12.855
"Who are you
and should I believe you or not?"

05:13.105 --> 05:14.857
And I'm like, "No, no, no, really,
really we're gonna do this."

05:14.940 --> 05:17.901
And the OEMs all,
you know, laughed in his face.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.529
Like we understand enough
about the console business

05:20.612 --> 05:23.073
to know that all the money
is made on the software.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.534
And you're coming to us and asking us
just to make the hardware

05:25.617 --> 05:27.870
while you make the software?
We're not that dumb.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.456
Rick's point of view was we
have no chance of doing this ourselves.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.544
And so then the question
became how do we partner with Nintendo,

05:35.627 --> 05:38.005
or maybe we should partner with Sega.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.425
Sega seemed like a natural choice

05:41.508 --> 05:45.220
because of Microsoft's previous
collaboration on the Dreamcast.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.181
But there
was pushback against the partnership.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.975
Dreamcast had never
been competitive with Sony

05:50.058 --> 05:54.354
and Xbox needed to be unlike
anything Microsoft had tried before.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.149
That left one last great hope.

05:58.901 --> 06:03.530
With Nintendo 64-bit
technology, now Mario lives in a 3-D world

06:03.614 --> 06:05.616
and you can make him go wherever you want.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.743
As we began
to understand the business model,

06:07.826 --> 06:09.786
we really appreciated Nintendo.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.039
People don't buy consoles, they buy games.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.669
They want to play <i>Mario</i>, they wanna
play <i>Pok√©mon</i>, they wanna play <i>Zelda</i>.

06:17.753 --> 06:21.256
Accepting the award
for <i>Ocarina of Time</i>

06:21.340 --> 06:23.175
will be Shigeru Miyamoto.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.719
You look at Nintendo
and you find the Spielberg

06:25.802 --> 06:29.515
of the video game industry in Miyamoto
and you go, "Wow this guy's unbelievable."

06:29.598 --> 06:31.642
Thank you, thank you very much.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.396
I knew I could convince Microsoft
to outright buy Nintendo.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.732
I mean it would be
an amazing accomplishment

06:38.815 --> 06:41.735
because it's a national treasure of Japan.

06:41.818 --> 06:46.532
So if you buy Nintendo, you get
credibility in the Japanese market.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.409
You maybe even get Miyamoto.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.745
Was there a way to make that happen,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.789
because that would
give us instant credibility.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.834
If Microsoft were to acquire Nintendo,
they would have gotten two things.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.046
One was the hardware
and second is a massive games portfolio.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.216
From Rick's point of view,
if you could acquire Nintendo,

07:04.299 --> 07:07.886
you would immediately have access to the
best game library in the world, full stop.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.723
So I made an introduction to the
people that ran Nintendo of America,

07:11.807 --> 07:16.436
told them what we were interested in
and then we made a trip to Kyoto.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.689
And who do you think you are,
barging into my office?

07:18.772 --> 07:21.567
But I could tell from the first meeting
that there wasn't a chance

07:21.650 --> 07:23.193
this was gonna happen,
they were highly skeptical.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.361
Guards!

07:24.444 --> 07:27.364
They were like, not even remotely
interested in selling the business.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.118
I never got past square one
on trying to acquire them.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.663
That to me is the pivotal point for Xbox.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.874
Oh my gosh, we're actually
gonna do this ourselves.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.543
And that scared the crap out of us.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.422
Because once it became
a do-it-ourselves project,

07:43.505 --> 07:46.967
now the Microsoft brand is on the line,
the Microsoft name's on the line.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.635
It's going to be big and public.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.095
We're gonna have
to do a lot of things new,

07:50.179 --> 07:51.555
we're gonna do hardware at scale.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.849
We are no longer
in the Microsoft playbook.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.143
An unprecedented challenge

07:56.226 --> 07:58.896
called for some changeups
and new additions to the team.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.065
Ted, Nat and Otto left for other pursuits,

08:02.399 --> 08:04.484
while Thompson brought on someone new,

08:04.568 --> 08:06.528
someone known within Microsoft

08:06.612 --> 08:10.699
for delivering complex projects
against impossible deadlines.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.999
One day this guy comes
into my office and he sits down

08:19.082 --> 08:20.876
and I'm like, "Who are you?"

08:20.959 --> 08:23.086
And he says, "I'm J. Allard."
I said, "Who's J. Allard?"

08:23.170 --> 08:25.923
And he looks at me like,
"Everybody knows who I am, right?"

08:26.006 --> 08:28.884
We're really on the cusp
of this digital entertainment revolution.

08:28.967 --> 08:32.095
So while for 25 years now
Microsoft prided itself

08:32.179 --> 08:34.056
on making the world more productive,

08:34.139 --> 08:37.809
now our challenge is to blend that
with making the world less productive,

08:37.893 --> 08:39.436
you know?

08:39.520 --> 08:44.691
He was seen as a futurist that had a lot
of credibility internally at Microsoft.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.903
There was you know,
the famous Internet memo.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.322
He sent Bill Gates
this memo that basically said,

08:50.405 --> 08:52.115
"Hey Bill, we gotta wake up.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.452
'Cause this thing called the Internet is
coming and it is going to transform

08:55.536 --> 08:59.248
commerce, it's going to transform society,
and it's going to be powered

08:59.331 --> 09:00.749
by broadband connections."

09:00.832 --> 09:04.503
And so we made a huge bold bet
by putting a broadband connection

09:04.586 --> 09:05.671
in the back of the Xbox.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.005
Everybody thought we were nuts.

09:07.089 --> 09:10.008
You have to remember back in 1999

09:10.092 --> 09:13.762
less than 5% of the U.S. households
even had broadband.

09:13.846 --> 09:18.183
But I remember J. saying, "We're going
to bet on the future, not against it."

09:18.267 --> 09:22.813
He had a vision for where online gaming
could go and what Xbox could become

09:22.896 --> 09:24.648
and Bill paid attention to J.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.526
It's very hip
to be on the Internet right now.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.780
With the right team together,
Xbox needed the right operating system.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.450
And that was a little tricky...
and political.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.161
It's just amazing how popular PCs are.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.999
Windows had been the catalyst
for Microsoft's meteoric rise.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.711
Games,
word processors, calculators, calendars,

09:45.836 --> 09:47.588
all running faster than ever.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.382
Bill Gates
had been won over to the team's pitch

09:50.465 --> 09:53.218
on the understanding
that Windows would power Xbox.

09:53.302 --> 09:56.972
But the team knew that Xbox
needed to be leaner than a PC.

09:57.055 --> 10:01.852
Windows was an all-purpose tank.
Xbox needed a street racer.

10:03.478 --> 10:07.149
One of the things that makes Windows great
is that you can do lots of things at once.

10:07.232 --> 10:11.528
You can be running Word next to Excel
next to IM next to Photoshop.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.238
And so the idea was

10:13.322 --> 10:15.240
if we're gonna put
a video game console in the living room,

10:15.324 --> 10:16.491
it's gonna run Windows.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.993
Once or twice a week

10:18.076 --> 10:21.622
we'd get pings from all sorts
of different groups around Microsoft.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.624
Office was kind of the notorious one,

10:23.707 --> 10:27.544
saying, "Hey I hear we're doing a console.
I hear it's gonna run Windows.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.672
What do I have to do to get
a build of Office running on it?

10:30.756 --> 10:34.510
I bet people would like to edit their Word
documents while sitting on the couch."

10:36.929 --> 10:38.305
What's the rating of this?

10:38.388 --> 10:40.015
Do I, I think, so...

10:40.682 --> 10:43.393
We had to do two things, one, we had
to tell these groups to off.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.728
That is not what this is.

10:44.811 --> 10:48.941
If you actually think people want to sit
back on their couch doing spreadsheets,

10:49.024 --> 10:50.400
it's not going to happen.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.946
At the same time,
we needed a lot of code from these groups.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.365
So we had to tell them
to off nicely.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.575
You're dismissed.

10:58.659 --> 11:02.079
The services
that Windows provides are really valuable,

11:02.162 --> 11:05.791
but the most important thing
for games is speed.

11:05.874 --> 11:09.419
If you have an operating system
taking 15% of the CPU

11:09.503 --> 11:11.004
and half the disk, you're dead.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.927
One possible solution was
to use just the Windows NT kernel,

11:17.010 --> 11:20.013
essentially the brain of the operating system.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.349
This would leave
more space and flexibility

11:22.432 --> 11:24.601
for developers to program games.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.979
There was just
one problem with that solution.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.232
The Xbox team
didn't have access to that kernel

11:30.315 --> 11:33.235
and the Windows team
wasn't about to share it.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.406
Here we are in the computer room
that holds all of our server machines.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.449
If we'd have gone
and asked the Windows team,

11:39.533 --> 11:42.411
they would have insisted
that we take Windows as is,

11:42.494 --> 11:45.163
no modifications,
subject to their approval,

11:45.247 --> 11:47.833
and we just could not
bring that baggage over.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.004
So we had to steal it.
We stole it. We stole it, yes.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.673
I have it running on this machine here.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.425
We actually grabbed it at night

11:56.508 --> 11:58.635
off of the server when no one was looking,

11:58.719 --> 12:02.681
about three weeks before a major
Windows release was going to happen.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.185
We brought it back and just started
hacking and slashing stuff out of it.

12:06.268 --> 12:12.316
We had to refactor and cleave off
functionality to make this box so tuned

12:13.192 --> 12:14.693
that the games could be brilliant.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.238
What started out
as a four and a half megabyte

12:18.322 --> 12:21.617
working set for the kernel,
got that down to about 200k.

12:21.700 --> 12:28.248
So a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of what
Windows is actually made it over to Xbox.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.501
You could call this
the evolutionary approach.

12:30.584 --> 12:34.588
It becomes clear
that what we're going to do

12:34.671 --> 12:39.009
is not what Bill and Steve
thought they had approved.

12:39.092 --> 12:44.473
Xbox would have the heritage of Windows
but not actually Windows itself.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.100
The new operating system was streamlined,

12:47.184 --> 12:49.228
but nothing like
the Windows-powered version

12:49.311 --> 12:53.357
the team had pitched to win the technology
bake-off against Windows CE.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.611
With GDC 2000 just one month away,
for Thompson and the team

12:57.694 --> 12:59.112
it was the moment of truth.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.406
Time to call one final meeting.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.991
A do-or-die presentation

13:03.075 --> 13:06.703
to Bill Gates on Valentine's Day
to ask if he could open his heart

13:06.787 --> 13:09.998
to a Windows-light version of Xbox.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.918
We had to go to Bill and tell him

13:13.001 --> 13:15.838
what he wanted most out of this,
he was not going to get.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.382
This wasn't going to run Windows.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.384
I can't imagine how it could be better.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.053
Oh [BLEEP], Bill's not gonna be happy.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.931
This was the final meeting

13:26.014 --> 13:28.350
to either approve the Xbox or cancel it.

13:28.433 --> 13:32.521
One of the highest stakes meetings
I was at my whole time at Microsoft.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.064
Which is the Valentine's Day Massacre.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.779
It's like a 4:00, 4:30 meeting.

13:40.863 --> 13:45.367
Rick Thompson, myself, Ed Fries,
J. Allard are the 4 Xbox folks there.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.785
Steve's there.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.621
And there was
a whole outer group of people too,

13:49.705 --> 13:51.331
so this room was packed.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.668
About 15 minutes late, Bill walks in.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.963
He's holding the PowerPoint presentation

13:58.046 --> 14:02.426
and he walks up to the table and he throws
it down on the table and he says,

14:02.509 --> 14:06.471
"This is a insult to everything
I've accomplished at this company."

14:06.638 --> 14:10.851
Leans across at me and says,
"Why are you trying to kill Windows?"

14:10.934 --> 14:14.229
"You guys have lied to me.
You guys have like played me for a fool."

14:14.313 --> 14:16.481
I start to try to argue for this,

14:16.565 --> 14:19.443
why we can't have
the normal version of Windows.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.486
Bill doesn't want anything to do with it.
He doesn't want to hear it.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.280
He yells at me, he shuts me down.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.783
And you got a lotta
alphas in the room and all alpha males

14:26.867 --> 14:29.912
and so there's a lot of pounding the table
and, "You're wrong, I'm right."

14:29.995 --> 14:33.999
By then J.'s up, he's ready
to fight, and so then J. goes in.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.959
Then Robbie tries to talk to Bill.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.878
And Bill yells at Robbie.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.881
If I'd had glasses on, I would have
needed windshield wipers on them

14:41.215 --> 14:43.675
because he was spitting at us
so hard and so fast.

14:43.759 --> 14:46.678
Bill would yell at us for a while
about these different things

14:46.762 --> 14:49.056
and then Ballmer would take over
on the business case

14:49.139 --> 14:50.557
and the business case looked terrible.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.976
By now, and the reason
it's called the Valentine's Day Massacre

14:53.060 --> 14:55.270
is 'cause all Valentine's Day
activities are now off.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.980
The candles at home are melting.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.649
You know we're all missing dinner.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.907
And the meeting gets
to this sort of crescendo

15:07.574 --> 15:10.786
and I said,
"Okay well then let's not do it.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.371
We haven't announced anything."

15:12.788 --> 15:15.082
So that led to another hour.

15:15.165 --> 15:19.127
And then somebody says, "What about Sony?"

15:20.003 --> 15:22.798
Microsoft had owned
the den and the office.

15:22.881 --> 15:26.510
How cool!

15:26.593 --> 15:28.637
And the thought of Sony

15:28.720 --> 15:31.265
owning the rest
of the home is offensive to Bill.

15:32.349 --> 15:36.019
But the Xbox, it's the antithesis
of everything that Microsoft is.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.063
It takes all
of the hardware burden onto us

15:38.146 --> 15:40.524
so it's really hard
to make business sense of it.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.359
That's equally offensive.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.486
And what's going on with Bill and Steve

15:44.570 --> 15:48.532
was figuring out which of those
was least offensive to them.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.869
Bill kind of pauses and he thinks

15:52.035 --> 15:56.248
and he says, "I think we should do this."

15:56.331 --> 16:00.377
And Ballmer's like,
"Yeah we should do this."

16:00.586 --> 16:03.005
And then they started getting excited
and starts going back and forth,

16:03.088 --> 16:04.965
"We should do this,
we should let these guys do this."

16:05.048 --> 16:06.216
Bill was like, "Okay,

16:06.300 --> 16:08.177
we're gonna give you guys
everything you ask for.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.012
We really want you
to be successful on this project.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.097
You have all my support."

16:12.181 --> 16:14.975
And that part
of the meeting took five minutes.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.060
And I turned to Robbie and I'm like,

16:17.144 --> 16:21.565
"Robbie, that was the weirdest meeting
I've been in in 15 years at this company."

16:21.648 --> 16:23.525
All I remember is Kevin Bachus coming by

16:23.609 --> 16:26.069
and basically saying,
"We're doing it, we're doing it!"

16:26.153 --> 16:27.905
The system was gonna get built.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.324
Hundreds of millions of dollars
would be spent marketing it.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.076
Even Ballmer said, "Once we say
yes to this, we're saying yes to this.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.329
This is real.
This is as real as it gets right now.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.749
We're going to book the speech at GDC."

16:38.832 --> 16:41.752
Bill Gates was going to go on stage
in front of the world and announce it.

16:41.835 --> 16:47.633
And it became very real
when Rick Thompson sent an email

16:47.716 --> 16:53.430
saying that Xbox had been approved for
an initial funding of a billion dollars.

16:57.392 --> 17:01.438
With a billion dollars on the
line and less than a month left until GDC,

17:01.522 --> 17:04.608
Xbox's big debut had
more riding on it than ever.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.361
The team set to work creating a prototype

17:07.444 --> 17:09.571
and recruiting
game developers to the platform,

17:09.655 --> 17:13.992
a monumental task for a software company
that didn't have much street cred.

17:14.243 --> 17:17.162
When it came
to console gaming in the late 90s,

17:17.246 --> 17:19.373
there was no perception of Microsoft.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.791
They weren't in the picture.

17:20.874 --> 17:25.128
But when it came to the PC side of gaming,
Microsoft had a reputation.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.508
Ed Fries had built Microsoft Game Studios

17:29.591 --> 17:32.719
and kind of organized
the studio structure by genre.

17:32.803 --> 17:37.975
We had like a roleplaying studio,
we had a sports studio.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.019
We were doing golf,
we had a basketball title

17:41.103 --> 17:42.187
and we had a baseball title.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.607
But it was around the time
we shipped <i>Age of Empires</i>

17:45.691 --> 17:47.484
that we started to really get respect.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.904
<i>AGE OF EMPIRES</i>
You've built a glorious empire!

17:50.988 --> 17:53.949
It was just a beautiful game.
It was beautifully scored.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.578
<i>Age</i> was a great game,
it was a ton of fun, everyone loved it.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.955
GEORGE PECKHAM:<i>Age of Empires</i> is a grand franchise,

18:00.038 --> 18:03.125
but if you talk to somebody
that likes to play <i>Super Mario Brothers</i>,

18:03.208 --> 18:05.377
it's really kind
of a different customer entirely

18:05.460 --> 18:07.754
and I think that they
didn't necessarily view Microsoft

18:07.838 --> 18:09.590
as being in the gaming business.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.216
Here we go!

18:12.134 --> 18:15.554
To recruit console
game developers to its unproven platform,

18:15.637 --> 18:17.723
Microsoft had to innovate development tools

18:17.806 --> 18:20.893
that would rival the competition,
making game developers

18:20.976 --> 18:22.769
an offer they couldn't refuse.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.606
We were all about what we were giving

18:25.689 --> 18:29.443
the game developers to work with
to create the greatest games ever made.

18:29.526 --> 18:36.033
The PS2 was a really, really
unfriendly environment to developers.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.496
Seamus Blackley
and Kevin Bachus and Ed Fries,

18:41.580 --> 18:43.665
they were saying, "We're gonna fix this,

18:43.749 --> 18:46.126
so more of the money
is going on the screen,

18:46.210 --> 18:48.795
not just trying
to figure out the convoluted hardware."

18:48.879 --> 18:52.591
And that was like, really?
I mean, it was like oxygen.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.304
This was gonna do
things that the PlayStation can't,

18:57.387 --> 19:00.140
which meant to me
we could tell more stories,

19:00.224 --> 19:02.267
create characters that people care about,

19:02.351 --> 19:06.772
and create worlds that would be
very difficult to do on the PlayStation.

19:06.855 --> 19:07.940
It's time!

19:08.023 --> 19:11.068
We know at this point we're heading
toward an Xbox announcement at GDC.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.278
Game developers have to be excited,

19:13.362 --> 19:16.698
so that they could talk to their
other friends in the games industry

19:16.782 --> 19:19.576
and tell them,
"You know what? Xbox is legit."

19:20.452 --> 19:24.039
The innovations offered
in the Xbox created a promising future

19:24.122 --> 19:25.582
for console game developers,

19:25.666 --> 19:28.794
but to deliver that future,
Microsoft still needed to complete

19:28.877 --> 19:32.631
a working prototype to debut onstage
at the Game Developers Conference.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.635
When Microsoft first started
talking about doing a game console,

19:36.718 --> 19:38.554
everybody's willing to listen,
but you need to see it.

19:39.638 --> 19:43.642
We had to create a prototype game console
that was obviously not gonna be

19:43.725 --> 19:46.228
the final design of the hardware
because we didn't know what Xbox

19:46.311 --> 19:51.275
was ultimately gonna look like, but
at the same time look nothing like a PC.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.612
I had started working with the hardware
guys' rapid prototyping group,

19:55.696 --> 19:58.448
which was literally in the parking garage.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.200
And they had like built
a temporary structure

20:00.284 --> 20:03.245
in a bunch of parking spaces
and like made it like a little office.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.205
So I went to this area
where the artists were

20:05.289 --> 20:08.792
and they were having a remote-controlled
car race in the office.

20:08.876 --> 20:11.920
Around the desks,
going "eyweyu," running around.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.047
And that's how I met Horace Luke.

20:15.174 --> 20:18.051
In a lot of ways I work very scatter mind.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.429
I don't really work on a linear path.

20:21.221 --> 20:25.058
Most of my day is spent
with markers and paper and just doodling.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.145
I remember the guys coming in
about six or seven in the evening

20:28.228 --> 20:32.357
when everybody was leaving the office
with this big motherboard from the '90s,

20:32.441 --> 20:36.320
this gigantic board
that had all these PCI slots on it.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.572
And they said, "Put this into something

20:38.655 --> 20:40.157
that is presentable on stage."

20:40.240 --> 20:43.535
And I still remember staring at it going,
"What do I do with this thing?"

20:44.578 --> 20:47.831
The traditional Microsoft product
was very ergonomic-centric.

20:47.915 --> 20:51.585
The mouse, the keyboard,
but with the Xbox it was very different.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.086
It was about storytelling.

20:53.170 --> 20:56.673
And there's a lot of people focused
on what's this set-top box

20:56.757 --> 20:58.133
gonna look like in my living room?

20:58.217 --> 21:00.052
But that wasn't what we cared about.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.304
Horace was really interested

21:02.387 --> 21:04.932
in what was happening
when you got sucked through that screen.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.727
The role of the designer,
it was how to tell the story at a glance.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.730
That Microsoft is about to go into a space

21:11.813 --> 21:14.650
that is brand-new
to what Microsoft was accustomed to,

21:14.733 --> 21:19.112
telling people that this thing is going to
be the most badass thing you can imagine.

21:19.196 --> 21:22.783
I would go down to visit Horace
and there would be scraps

21:22.866 --> 21:27.871
of prototype drawings and other pieces
of vision work that he would have.

21:27.955 --> 21:31.041
The whole idea
was this nuclear reactor almost,

21:31.124 --> 21:34.753
trying to hold this energy
that's inside that is so intense.

21:34.837 --> 21:38.715
He's like, "Dude we need
a metal X and it's gotta have a green eye

21:38.799 --> 21:40.509
you know, shooting a laser out!"

21:40.592 --> 21:42.803
And he's always gonna use sound effects,

21:42.886 --> 21:46.306
so he was gonna be like,
"pccchow," "pshhhh", "chccck!"

21:46.390 --> 21:48.225
"I want it to blind people!"

21:48.308 --> 21:50.102
Because that's kind of
how Horace would talk about these things.

21:52.896 --> 21:56.275
That sense of escape
and that sense of capability

21:56.358 --> 21:58.819
and power was what we
trying to create with this green portal,

21:58.902 --> 22:01.697
and inside there everything is possible.

22:01.905 --> 22:05.659
That was how we wanted people
to feel when it's onstage.

22:05.742 --> 22:09.079
You could have
shown up to GDC and plugged in a PC

22:09.371 --> 22:11.164
and tried to tell people it was a console,

22:11.248 --> 22:15.419
and not a single person in that audience,
I don't even think we would have believed

22:15.502 --> 22:17.629
that that was really
going to be a console.

22:17.713 --> 22:21.675
So we knew we needed
to show something beautiful.

22:21.758 --> 22:24.052
People gotta be able
to tell, in an instant,

22:25.262 --> 22:27.389
that this thing is called Xbox.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.393
What we ended up building was a 40 pound,

22:31.810 --> 22:37.983
machined, aluminum X that had
been buffed to a chrome finish.

22:38.066 --> 22:43.071
These big, beautiful, shiny chrome Xs.

22:43.155 --> 22:46.575
They were
like these incredible sports cars.

22:46.658 --> 22:50.746
We ended up taking a,
literally a solid hunk of aluminum

22:50.829 --> 22:54.333
and carved it with a six-axis CNC machine.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.961
That box took two weeks to carve
and one week to polish.

22:58.045 --> 23:03.091
Building those metal Xs was...
very trying.

23:03.175 --> 23:06.595
Drew and I just after work,
you know, get a can of kerosene,

23:07.221 --> 23:09.306
get a rag and just keep buffing it.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.808
Rub, rub, rub
until that thing was polished.

23:11.892 --> 23:15.354
Somebody brought it out
into a meeting and took a towel off of it

23:15.437 --> 23:17.397
and showed it to us and I was like,

23:17.481 --> 23:19.107
"That can't be in people's living rooms."

23:19.775 --> 23:21.818
And everyone was like,
"Calm down it's a concept."

23:23.111 --> 23:25.614
And I'm like,
"Okay, awesome about the green eye.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.449
How am I gonna
fit the components in there?"

23:28.867 --> 23:30.619
And what we ended up doing
is if you look at a PC,

23:30.702 --> 23:33.413
there's like this main motherboard
so we stuck the motherboard at this,

23:33.497 --> 23:35.457
you know, on like one angle.

23:35.541 --> 23:37.793
We had to
shave off the edge of the motherboard

23:37.876 --> 23:39.294
because it just didn't fit.

23:39.378 --> 23:41.588
We soldered
the hardware together ourselves

23:41.672 --> 23:42.923
and borrowed space in the lab.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.716
You know, I'm sure people looked
at that and they were like,

23:44.800 --> 23:48.512
"Whoa, it's like this polished X,
it's got this you know amazing green eye,"

23:48.595 --> 23:51.139
but it was the world's messiest PC build.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.767
Like it was
components like just jammed in there

23:53.851 --> 23:55.894
and you're like, "Is it gonna work?"

23:55.978 --> 23:57.938
"Oh well, it worked this time.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.898
I guess that's the one
we'll take with us to GDC."

24:02.442 --> 24:04.820
It's sometimes possible to
forget about the people

24:04.903 --> 24:06.154
who actually make the games.

24:06.238 --> 24:08.615
And so we're here in San Jose, California

24:08.824 --> 24:11.535
for the Game Developers' Conference
to remind ourselves

24:11.618 --> 24:14.705
that without these people
we'd still be playing checkers.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.668
Announcing Xbox
at the Game Developers' Conference

24:19.751 --> 24:22.421
was like every
Christmas morning rolled up together.

24:22.504 --> 24:26.758
Video game developers are upping
the ante on creating realistic games.

24:26.842 --> 24:32.139
Microsoft ups the competitive ante,
announcing a new concept codenamed Xbox.

24:32.222 --> 24:36.643
At GDC, the idea
was that Seamus would go on

24:36.935 --> 24:41.899
and basically be the demo guy,
talk about Xbox, show the demos.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.193
But this was the first time that Seamus

24:44.276 --> 24:48.071
had stood in front of an audience
of game developers and gamers

24:48.155 --> 24:49.865
since the launch of <i>Trespasser</i>.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.075
Before he came to Microsoft,

24:52.159 --> 24:55.954
we knew Seamus from his stint
at DreamWorks on <i>Trespasser</i>.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.626
It was a personal passion of Spielberg.
He was very involved in it.

25:00.709 --> 25:05.756
I'm in Steven Spielberg's
office, and we're gonna do a game

25:05.839 --> 25:08.467
that could be a spiritual successor
to <i>Jurassic Park</i>

25:08.550 --> 25:11.553
that takes all
of the principles of game design

25:11.637 --> 25:13.096
that I thought were important.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.766
Seamus really hit on this idea

25:15.849 --> 25:21.396
of trying to use physics to simulate
a world populated by dinosaurs.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.690
I wrote a big physics system in order

25:23.774 --> 25:26.777
to make an island that was
completely physically simulated.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.737
And then he's saying, "Every leaf

25:28.820 --> 25:31.156
and every branch that you walk
into in the woods is gonna move."

25:31.240 --> 25:34.535
And that was kind of a dream
that we're like, "Yeah that sounds good.

25:34.618 --> 25:37.913
but how are you gonna do that, you know,
how are you gonna make that perform?"

25:37.996 --> 25:39.831
Well, the end of the story was we're not.

25:39.915 --> 25:41.708
And I made every mistake in the book.

25:41.792 --> 25:43.210
You can read about this online,

25:43.293 --> 25:45.504
all the stupid things
I didn't manage in that project,

25:45.587 --> 25:47.339
and we shipped it before it was done.

25:48.423 --> 25:52.135
We shipped this broken game
right into the jaws

25:52.219 --> 25:56.265
of the birth of Internet gaming sites
and the first fan sites.

25:56.348 --> 25:59.726
I personally just got destroyed online,

25:59.810 --> 26:02.396
and I had never seen
anybody destroyed online.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.440
We know what that's like now.
I thought my career was over.

26:05.524 --> 26:09.653
Everyone who was present in San Jose

26:09.736 --> 26:13.824
at the Game Developers' Conference,
they knew my failures with <i>Trespasser.</i>

26:13.907 --> 26:18.120
I remember sitting in my hotel room
and I had to convince myself

26:18.203 --> 26:19.913
to just go show my face at this thing.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.456
And it was terrifying.

26:25.169 --> 26:29.673
The day of the unveil
of Xbox, I took 3 Xboxes with me,

26:29.756 --> 26:32.050
like these metal Xs, one for the stage

26:32.134 --> 26:34.887
and then two for as like, you know,
what happens if we, if this fails?

26:34.970 --> 26:37.806
We hand carry
these things down in transit

26:37.890 --> 26:39.224
because these things are fragile.

26:39.308 --> 26:41.894
The idea was showing live demos,

26:41.977 --> 26:44.688
proving that we actually
had nothing up our sleeves.

26:44.771 --> 26:49.067
The game developers are not gonna be
tolerant of any level of at all.

26:49.151 --> 26:53.155
All the things on the screen
were specifically to show game developers

26:53.238 --> 26:57.159
that this Xbox was far and away better

26:57.242 --> 26:59.786
than any of the other consoles
that they'd ever seen before.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.914
And they have to be done in such a way

27:02.581 --> 27:04.917
where it's clearly interactive,
clearly real,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.337
clearly running
on the hardware as advertised.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.672
We hand carry them down.

27:11.507 --> 27:14.384
We set them up, we turn them on.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.304
The first one doesn't work.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.640
I opened up the first machine like,

27:19.723 --> 27:21.517
I'm like what the
is going on here,

27:21.600 --> 27:24.061
like something jiggling around
that wasn't quite right

27:24.144 --> 27:26.647
and you're like, "Oh my God,
like what happened in there?"

27:26.730 --> 27:29.399
So then we set up
the second one, it doesn't work either.

27:29.483 --> 27:31.818
And the third one, none of them work.

27:31.902 --> 27:36.657
Seamus is backstage soldering,
trying to get everything ready

27:36.740 --> 27:38.700
as the auditorium is filling up.

27:38.784 --> 27:42.412
He was looking on the verge
of green, he just looked sick.

27:42.496 --> 27:44.748
You know, I was like,
well maybe this is stage nerves,

27:44.831 --> 27:47.709
but then I realized, you know,
well maybe it's also because

27:47.793 --> 27:50.629
all of our demo machines
were completely deconstructed.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.132
We're panicked out of our minds

27:54.216 --> 27:55.884
because Seamus went on stage

27:55.968 --> 27:59.638
to talk to the most cynical audience
in the entire world.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.724
If you took a photo from the stage of GDC,

28:02.808 --> 28:06.019
you would see,
you know, gamers and game developers

28:06.103 --> 28:07.938
and they'd all look very excited

28:08.021 --> 28:12.943
but underneath that layer are, you know,
the most critical people you've ever met,

28:13.026 --> 28:14.945
waiting to hate
that thing that you created.

28:15.028 --> 28:18.198
Kevin was underneath the stage

28:18.282 --> 28:23.370
with a video switch box that could switch
from the Xbox prototype that was onstage

28:23.453 --> 28:28.125
running the demos to one that Drew
was standing backstage doing everything

28:28.208 --> 28:30.419
the same way
I was doing it so Kevin could switch

28:30.502 --> 28:32.045
between the two
of them in case it crashed.

28:33.463 --> 28:37.092
And it's in front of the boss,
the boss is coming on!

28:37.176 --> 28:40.596
I'd like to ask Seamus Blackley
to come on out and give us a look.

28:41.013 --> 28:43.182
And then somebody decided
we're gonna make him put on

28:43.265 --> 28:45.267
a special leather jacket
that doesn't really fit him!

28:45.350 --> 28:49.271
We don't have the box
but we do have the leather jacket

28:49.354 --> 28:51.148
so we're ready to go.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.525
Well, we do have one box.
This is our showbox.

28:56.028 --> 28:58.655
So now,
as I walk out on stage with Bill G.,

28:58.739 --> 29:02.868
the full weight
of my failed game, <i>Trespasser</i>,

29:04.161 --> 29:06.496
all of my dreams in the game industry,

29:06.580 --> 29:09.333
the ridicule
that I thought I was gonna suffer

29:09.416 --> 29:11.001
at the hands of every game developer

29:11.084 --> 29:13.420
who saw me fail
to deliver this great thing,

29:13.504 --> 29:15.130
all of that pressure came to bear.

29:16.715 --> 29:19.551
I get up there and I run the first demo.

29:19.635 --> 29:21.386
What I'm gonna show you now is an example

29:21.470 --> 29:25.057
of advanced lighting techniques
that are possible under DirectX 8.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.894
We made a bunch of
little toys that sat around your desk

29:28.977 --> 29:32.105
like a little merry-go-round
with dynamic lights.

29:32.189 --> 29:34.650
Complicated shadows drawn
across very complicated objects,

29:34.733 --> 29:37.027
there's reflections,
there's environment mapping going on,

29:37.110 --> 29:39.404
and all this
is happening at full hardware rates.

29:39.988 --> 29:43.158
Another great example of that
is our water demo.

29:43.242 --> 29:46.203
You could now see
caustics on the bottom of a pool.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.997
All those things come
from the power of processing

29:49.081 --> 29:50.457
on a per-pixel basis

29:50.541 --> 29:53.210
and that's really what
the big differentiator was for Xbox.

29:53.293 --> 29:56.338
This demo
took I think a day to get running.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.298
And I can't underscore
the importance of that enough.

29:58.382 --> 30:01.468
This takes Xbox from being
a programmer-driven console

30:01.552 --> 30:04.346
to being an artist-driven console,
to a design-driven console.

30:04.429 --> 30:06.682
And that's really
at the heart of the entire program.

30:06.765 --> 30:08.433
The demo, it had a joke in it.

30:08.517 --> 30:11.270
There's a classic Microsoft picture
in the background.

30:11.603 --> 30:15.107
Oh yeah baby,
that's texture resolution right there.

30:15.816 --> 30:18.652
These were really
smart demos and really ambitious.

30:19.361 --> 30:23.699
But when we saw the physics demo, and I
was like, "Wow, how is that computing?"

30:23.782 --> 30:28.537
In my high school physics class I was
scarred with the image of chain reaction

30:28.620 --> 30:31.790
as demonstrated by the old ping pong ball
and mousetrap demo.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.168
Physics was something
that everybody wanted to do.

30:34.251 --> 30:38.547
Seamus had tried physics
with his <i>Jurassic Park</i> game,

30:38.755 --> 30:40.549
and it didn't work so great.

30:40.632 --> 30:43.552
But now you were seeing those ideas
actually working right.

30:43.635 --> 30:45.262
A great example of the CPU

30:45.345 --> 30:47.806
doing all of this collision,
all of this physics at the same time

30:47.890 --> 30:50.184
that the graphics processor
is rendering the scene for us.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.393
Physics is cool!

30:52.853 --> 30:56.190
The Raven and Robot video,
you could see the photorealism.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.985
The huge chrome robot that
basically was motion captured

31:00.068 --> 31:02.070
by a female character called Raven.

31:02.154 --> 31:05.616
The level of physics
simulation that was happening there,

31:05.699 --> 31:07.826
how much the CPU was being taxed,

31:07.910 --> 31:11.496
you knew as a developer
this thing was really, really powerful.

31:11.580 --> 31:14.458
I was like,
"Wow we have got to get onto this box."

31:14.541 --> 31:17.211
I was very surprised by the Xbox.

31:17.294 --> 31:20.756
I was expecting it to be kind of
cool, kind of like a stripped down PC

31:20.839 --> 31:24.259
but what I wound up seeing
very much excited me.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.888
These demos were instrumental

31:27.971 --> 31:32.851
and so critical to the importance of Xbox
and people believing in it.

31:32.935 --> 31:36.188
To get honest, candid feedback
from our peers,

31:36.271 --> 31:40.192
it was exciting because we saw
the enthusiasm for Xbox.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.985
We knew that we had
accomplished something.

31:42.069 --> 31:44.863
Xbox is really gonna be
the king of the game stations.

31:44.947 --> 31:47.324
This is like a PlayStation 2 on steroids.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.536
People were kind of giving us
high fives, saying congratulations,

31:50.619 --> 31:52.120
and I'm like, "Did we actually do this?"

31:52.204 --> 31:53.914
I've never seen so much advance

31:53.997 --> 31:58.168
in one particular piece
of technology before. Ever.

31:58.252 --> 32:01.630
From that moment on,
we had credibility with publishers

32:01.755 --> 32:03.298
and with game developers,

32:03.382 --> 32:05.467
because it was clear
we did know what we were talking about.

32:06.051 --> 32:07.219
And the next thing that mattered was

32:07.302 --> 32:08.804
that Bill Gates showed up for it.

32:08.887 --> 32:14.351
That signaled to the industry,
and to the rest of the world,

32:14.434 --> 32:18.522
Microsoft as a company is backing it
with all of its might.

32:18.605 --> 32:20.357
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

32:24.361 --> 32:28.866
Despite all the fanfare surrounding
Microsoft's Xbox, industry analysts

32:28.949 --> 32:32.327
say the company is going to face
fierce competition.

32:32.411 --> 32:36.290
When Sony's newest video game
console, the PlayStation 2,

32:36.373 --> 32:38.292
went on sale in Japan earlier this week,

32:38.375 --> 32:40.794
consumers were frenzied with excitement.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.505
They snapped up nearly a million units

32:43.589 --> 32:47.176
at $370 apiece
in the first three days alone.

32:47.259 --> 32:50.554
We were at a disadvantage
compared to Sony or Nintendo

32:50.637 --> 32:53.640
because we didn't have
the legacy of building fun.

32:54.600 --> 32:58.312
And Sony, you know, oh they're movies
they're cool, they're awesome,

32:58.395 --> 33:01.148
and Microsoft is like they wear khakis
and they're boring

33:01.231 --> 33:03.734
and they're Office and they're
Windows and it's like...

33:04.610 --> 33:08.488
For over a year, the team
had referred to the top-secret new console

33:08.572 --> 33:11.241
only by its code name, Xbox.

33:11.325 --> 33:14.745
But now they had a chance
to christen it with a bold new name,

33:14.995 --> 33:17.998
one that wouldn't evoke
Microsoft's corporate image.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.753
Naming is the worst part of marketing.
It's the hardest thing.

33:22.836 --> 33:27.549
Nobody ever 100%
loves the name. Ever. Ever

33:28.133 --> 33:30.594
Marketing would go to
the same brand people that they would use

33:30.677 --> 33:32.095
for naming components of Windows,

33:32.179 --> 33:34.097
people who knew nothing about games.

33:34.181 --> 33:37.017
We paid hundreds of thousands of dollars

33:37.100 --> 33:39.520
to go through the most rigorous
system of naming,

33:40.103 --> 33:42.272
tested against all the right customers,

33:42.856 --> 33:45.359
and they came back with list after list.

33:46.276 --> 33:48.320
We had hundreds of names
that were generated.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.280
Frixion.

33:50.364 --> 33:52.032
Psyclipse.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.034
And they were epically terrible.

33:54.785 --> 33:55.911
Norbo.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.079
Infini-D.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.914
Zod, X-O-D.

33:58.997 --> 34:01.542
Shock Factor. Oh my God.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.877
Fire P... Fire Plug?

34:03.961 --> 34:05.254
Questria.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.506
Vybe, with a Y.

34:07.589 --> 34:11.134
Xantra. Xantra is absolutely
a blood pressure medication.

34:11.802 --> 34:13.262
Vrontier.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.848
Og. O-G.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.266
Velvet.

34:17.349 --> 34:18.517
Xig Xag.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.435
Zimulate.

34:20.519 --> 34:22.521
You see anytime you're naming something,

34:22.855 --> 34:26.108
you have to play the kindergarten game
that everybody plays with their children,

34:26.233 --> 34:28.652
you know, "Okay I'm going
to give my child this name.

34:28.735 --> 34:31.989
Now how are people going to butcher that
their first day of school, right?"

34:32.072 --> 34:33.782
Carpet Ride?

34:34.449 --> 34:36.493
I was having conversations
with Robbie about,

34:36.577 --> 34:38.537
"You know Robbie,
Xbox is a really good name."

34:38.620 --> 34:40.497
"No, you can't call it Xbox,
that's a code name.

34:40.581 --> 34:43.375
We don't name products code names.
We need a new name."

34:43.458 --> 34:45.002
It's like, "Okay we'll look again,"

34:45.127 --> 34:46.962
and so we'd look again and come back,

34:47.045 --> 34:48.672
"Xbox is a pretty good name."

34:49.923 --> 34:53.468
I remember our final meeting
with the naming experts.

34:53.552 --> 34:55.637
They came in with the perfect name.

34:55.721 --> 34:59.558
"We've tested this extensively
and it's a winner.

34:59.641 --> 35:03.145
We tested it against the name Xbox,
it blows it out of the water."

35:03.228 --> 35:04.813
"Great, what's the name?"

35:04.897 --> 35:08.150
With great fanfare, they unveil...

35:08.233 --> 35:10.360
11X.

35:10.444 --> 35:12.321
You know, 'cause it goes to 11?

35:12.404 --> 35:14.406
Well, it's one louder, isn't it?

35:14.489 --> 35:16.033
Eleven.

35:17.492 --> 35:20.537
I looked at the marketing people,
the marketing people looked at me,

35:21.538 --> 35:23.624
and they said,
"All right, we'll get on Xbox."

35:23.707 --> 35:26.001
Where can you go from there? Where?

35:26.084 --> 35:27.961
- I don't know.
- Nowhere. Exactly.

35:31.173 --> 35:34.426
There was a big debate internally
about whether we should call it

35:34.510 --> 35:37.429
the Microsoft Xbox or just Xbox.

35:38.305 --> 35:40.307
We did a lot of blind research

35:40.390 --> 35:43.227
where we would bring in gamers,
ask them questions

35:43.310 --> 35:46.813
about what should the role of the name
Microsoft be on this console?

35:47.481 --> 35:50.943
First response when we mentioned
Microsoft was they rolled their eyes.

35:51.026 --> 35:53.070
"A video game console from Microsoft?"

35:53.153 --> 35:55.364
What? Microsoft?

35:55.656 --> 35:56.740
Doing a console?

35:57.324 --> 35:59.618
First of all, it would take
forever to boot up

35:59.701 --> 36:02.204
and then it would probably blue screen.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.123
And then we asked them questions like,

36:05.207 --> 36:08.418
"Hey, if PlayStation were an animal,
what animal would it be?"

36:08.502 --> 36:11.088
"Oh, it'd be a lion,
the king of the jungle."

36:11.839 --> 36:13.882
"If Microsoft were an animal
what would it be it be?

36:13.966 --> 36:18.178
"It would be a spider, it could kill you,
but you also just want to step on it."

36:18.262 --> 36:22.850
If the name Microsoft smothered the brand,
it just was going to be a nonstarter.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.852
The idea that Microsoft could ever compete

36:24.935 --> 36:28.063
with Sony or Nintendo or even Sega
was seen as a bit of a joke.

36:28.146 --> 36:29.773
Might as well call it "Nerd Box," right?

36:30.399 --> 36:32.484
Bill Gates
was the richest man in the world.

36:32.568 --> 36:34.361
They were such an important tech force,

36:34.444 --> 36:36.989
but what they weren't
was in the living room.

36:37.072 --> 36:39.366
They weren't an entertainment company.

36:39.449 --> 36:41.743
Among gamers, 0% of people
believed we could do it.

36:41.827 --> 36:43.954
I was a journalist and I thought,

36:44.037 --> 36:47.875
"I don't know how Microsoft
is going to make a console worth [BLEEP]."

36:47.958 --> 36:50.294
Can you imagine walking up to Bill like,

36:50.377 --> 36:53.463
"Hey, you know what the biggest liability
I have in my new product launch is?

36:53.547 --> 36:54.715
The name of your company."
