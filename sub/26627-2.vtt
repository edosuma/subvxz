01:27.295 --> 01:28.505
[Ray] Off the bed!

01:29.047 --> 01:31.174
Hands up! Show me your hands! Cuff him!

01:31.257 --> 01:32.509
[woman shrieking]

01:33.510 --> 01:34.928
[agent 4] Hey. Give me your hands.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.639
[man] Take off these cuffs.
I have the right to an attorney.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.727
You have no right here.
Do you understand? You have no right.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.439

01:56.950 --> 01:59.077
-You got Mother Teresa.
-[both grunt]

01:59.160 --> 02:00.954
You actually bagged that asshole.

02:01.037 --> 02:05.583
Got his number one and number two also.
And two judges, district police cap...

02:05.667 --> 02:07.085
A freakin' deputy mayor.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.920
This is gonna be
a messy day for City Hall.

02:09.003 --> 02:09.838
Yeah.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.632
The Albanians had to be buying
those guys off with more than tail.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.510
Burgos got their computers,
so we're gonna find their money.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.596
Once we start tracking it,
who knows how far this goes?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.265
Thank you, Wilson Fisk.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.600
He's a gift that's gonna keep on giving.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.855
[Maggie] What did you do, Matthew?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.279
Where did you go last night?

05:22.697 --> 05:24.824
-Hey. Don't pull that crap with me.
-[groans]

05:24.907 --> 05:25.992
[Maggie] What happened?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.369
Go away.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.957
[chuckles] I put in way too much work
on you to quit now.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.042
Up. Move your ass.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.928
So you get beat by a guy
who wasn't even trying to hurt you,

05:46.012 --> 05:49.766
and your brilliant next move
is to go out and pick another fight?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.394
Here. Take these.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.401
A word of advice, Mr. Daredevil...

06:02.195 --> 06:06.199
give yourself time to heal,
or you're gonna get yourself killed.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.286
[Matt] You're probably right.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.706
Is that what you wanted?

06:16.501 --> 06:18.294
I have a special gift, too.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.006
I'm impervious to bad attitude.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.677
So you can throw your self-pitying
bullshit at me all day, Murdock,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.805
and I'll still be standing right here.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.973
Pissed off, maybe, but right here.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.103
You're gonna talk to me.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.022
Why did you become a nun?

06:39.857 --> 06:41.442
I heard God's call.

06:43.486 --> 06:47.198
So you feel like being a nun
is what you're meant to be?

06:48.908 --> 06:49.909
Yes.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
Very much.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.455
What if you couldn't be one anymore?

06:56.165 --> 06:57.834
If it were taken from you?

06:57.917 --> 07:01.504
Your point being
that if we can't fulfill our calling,

07:01.587 --> 07:03.714
we might be better off as worm food?

07:03.798 --> 07:05.299
-Answer the question.
-[scoffs]

07:06.217 --> 07:07.885
I'll tell you what I wouldn't do.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.221
I wouldn't lose faith.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.015
I'd find some other purpose.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.561
If you can be anything else,
it was never really your calling.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.148
Just tell me, honestly.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.067
If you could no longer be a nun,

07:24.485 --> 07:25.820
wouldn't you grieve?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.488
Of course I would.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.906
Then please...

07:30.783 --> 07:31.701
go away.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.542
I understand what it's like
to feel lost, Matthew.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.670
It happened to me, too, once.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.425
A long time ago,
when I was still a novitiate...

07:49.343 --> 07:51.053
I left the order for a while.

07:51.971 --> 07:52.889
Why?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.726
I was considering a very different life.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.812
It was wonderful and terrifying.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.525
I struggled to know which life
God wanted me to choose.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.111
I prayed. I looked for signs.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.280
In the end,

08:10.072 --> 08:13.284
I just had to do my best to figure it out.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.330
Well, there you go.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.750
That is the difference between us.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.879
I no longer care what God wants.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.798
Oh, right.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.718
Almost forgot.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.805
You've seen his true face now.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.905
[Lantom] Those are some
fancy moves, Matthew.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.743
Sister Dora turned me in, didn't she?

08:55.826 --> 08:57.203
This has to stop.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.999
My Confirmation is in the spring.
I'm supposed to be learning the catechism,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.126
and Sister D
can't even defend original sin.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.337
She is not a theologian.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.215
You already know more about it
than she does, I'm sure.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.925
So I can skip catechism?

09:11.008 --> 09:12.009
No.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
Come on.

09:15.972 --> 09:16.973
Sit.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.563
How many fights
have you been in this week?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.982
-[young Matt] How many guys complained?
-[Lantom] None.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.777
'Cause no one wants to admit
they got their butt kicked by a blind kid.

09:31.362 --> 09:35.241
-So you can't prove that I did anything.
-I don't want to, and I don't need to.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.411
It's not about proving anything, Matthew.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.414
Argumentation is a skill.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.917
Being argumentative is a sign.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.295
A sign like a prophecy?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.463
A sign like you're angry, Matthew.

09:50.381 --> 09:54.302
That's a perfectly understandable reaction
to your situation.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.096
But it's not sustainable.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.892
Or maybe it's a sign that Sister Dora
should stick to teaching math.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.644
[scoffs and chuckles]

10:03.728 --> 10:04.812
You're good...

10:05.438 --> 10:09.650
at arguing and deflecting
and denying you're angry to other people.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.989
[sighs] But you're gonna have to deal
with your anger, Matthew.

10:16.073 --> 10:19.619
Find a way to... harness it.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.331
-Or it will destroy you.
-Well, if that's God's plan for me,

10:23.414 --> 10:25.875
then I guess that's how
it's supposed to work out, isn't it?

10:27.460 --> 10:31.047
You know, maybe you don't understand
original sin, after all.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.759
God gave us free will, Matthew.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.846
Adam and Eve were not puppets,
and neither are we.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.098
We make our own choices.

10:41.182 --> 10:45.227
That's one reason we pray,
for help making good ones.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.813
You should try it sometime.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.690
I do pray.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.277
I pray all the time.
I've been praying for years.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.281
God doesn't talk to me.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.284
So that's what this is about?

11:00.868 --> 11:04.080
You feel God is... neglecting you?

11:05.247 --> 11:10.378
Matthew, the burning-bush business
doesn't happen very often,

11:10.461 --> 11:12.254
even in the Bible.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.049
He's usually more subtle than that.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.305
You want to hear God, Matthew,
you have to listen more carefully.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.851
Because he speaks in whispers.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.532
Veggie sub.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.201
-No meat.
-Thanks.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.578
You don't want it.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
[chuckles softly] Why not?

11:46.288 --> 11:49.834
When you see the way Ramsey
and Arinori are kissing Hattley's ass,

11:49.917 --> 11:51.836
you're gonna lose your appetite.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.630
They're in her office right now.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.507
Doing what?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.552
Hattley gave you this raid.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.470
But now that it worked,

12:01.554 --> 12:05.433
well, somebody's got to run
Fisk full time.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.517
Right? There he is.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.366
Man of the hour.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.786
You see the client list yet? Holy shit.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955
-[Ramsey chuckles]
-A moment, ma'am?

12:28.539 --> 12:29.540
Sure, Ray.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.592
Congratulations. Pristine execution.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.094
Glad to hear it, boss. I got a big ask.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.431
You want Fisk detail. I can't.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.767
He's my kill. I get to eat first.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.478
There's a goddamn buffet
in that conference room.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.729
You can't fill up on that?

12:51.812 --> 12:54.940
That's today. Now, what about tomorrow?

12:55.024 --> 12:58.736
Look, we play Fisk right,
there's plenty for everyone for years.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.781
He can give us every criminal organization
on the East Coast.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.115
Hey, Pryor.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.534
Find out how Burgos
is doing on the computers.

13:06.076 --> 13:10.664
Dozens of agents had their shot at Fisk.
None of them got shit. But I did.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.167
We got some big collars out of this, Ray.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.960
I'm gonna make sure D.C. knows about it.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.214
Why do I feel like there's a "but" coming?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.090
Shut the door.

13:27.014 --> 13:30.643
I put you on Fisk detail,
your file is required reading.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.062
You'll be naked. There will be questions.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.188
I've got answers.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.899
I've got a boss, too.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.735
And he's got a hard-on for agents
in financial holes.

13:40.778 --> 13:41.695
I'm sorry.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.240
No. No way.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.241
[Hattley] Easy, Ray.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.827
No. You tell D.C. that none of this
could have happened

13:47.910 --> 13:50.704
without the unexpected connection
between me and Wilson Fisk.

13:50.788 --> 13:51.956
Because that's the truth.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.500
And then none of the other shit
in my file will matter.

13:55.751 --> 13:56.877
Come on, Tammy.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.964
How am I supposed to get out from under?

14:03.759 --> 14:07.555
Okay, he's yours. But you need
to keep him talking, Ray.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.639
I got this.

14:08.722 --> 14:13.143
He better last years.
Because he goes dry, we're both burned.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.947
-[Karen] Hey.
-Hey.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.741
"Rostam Kazemi." Mean anything to you?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.494
-Uh, yeah, he's a real estate developer.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.413
Actually, his daughter, Neda,

14:32.496 --> 14:35.207
is the mean one
on the <i>Heiresses of Manhattan.</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:37.668
Not that I watch that kind of crap
or anything, but...

14:37.751 --> 14:38.836
No, of course not.

14:39.503 --> 14:43.048
Anyway, he and his daughter were attacked
outside a restaurant last night.

14:43.132 --> 14:47.303
He's in a coma at Riverbank Hospital,
think it might be a kidnapping attempt.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.722
No, you know what?
I think you should give TJ that story.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.265
He watches her show. He'd love it.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.476
Well, that's-- That's great.
That's nice. I'm giving it to you.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.437
No, I'm in the middle of something here.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.564
-Excuse me?
-It's not done yet,

14:58.647 --> 15:01.275
but I'd like to stick with it
if that's okay.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.276
What?

15:02.359 --> 15:03.444
[sighs]

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
Uh, yeah, here.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.455
What am I looking at?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.207
Uh... They're reports
of respiratory illnesses

15:17.291 --> 15:19.251
among residents
of a particular city block.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.087
They've spiked.
They're up, like, 45% from last year.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.799
-And which particular block would that be?
-44th and 11th.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.718
-Midland Circle adjacent.
-Karen.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.137
Come on. I know we've done
a lot of pieces on this,

15:30.220 --> 15:34.183
but there are still questions about
that night we don't have answers for.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.769
-You think the answers are in here?
-I don't know. Maybe.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.022
Just give me a couple days.
It's not done yet.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.276
What is it about Midland Circle, Karen?
I mean, it's not just a story, is it?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.615
Look. The work you've done on this,

15:49.698 --> 15:51.700
reporting, the writing...
it's excellent.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.037
It's great. It's some of the best
you've ever done. I'm proud of it.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.748
I'm even maybe a little bit jealous.

15:57.831 --> 15:58.958
But it's done.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.210
[smacks lips] So that's what we do now?

16:01.293 --> 16:04.088
We just drop stories because
some socialite who photographs well

16:04.171 --> 16:05.130
is down at the hospital?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.548
That's a story, too.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.428
And I thought that you might be able
to empathize with a young woman

16:11.512 --> 16:13.847
who's been caught up
in the middle of a family crisis.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.978
It's one thing to work a story, Karen.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.313
It's another thing
to let a story work you.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.401
-End of day tomorrow.
-Okay.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.866
[door buzzes]

16:35.327 --> 16:37.121
How the hell did you let this happen?

16:37.204 --> 16:39.456
Don't try to pin this shit on us.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.166
He's your snitch. [door buzzes]

16:47.965 --> 16:48.966
[door buzzes] You okay?

16:53.595 --> 16:54.805
They said it was superficial.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.975
I find it quite profound.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.059
Don't start.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.061
We're not playing games here.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.148
It's deadly serious for me.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.066
What? Some guy with a shank?

17:06.817 --> 17:09.862
It's not something I fear a great deal.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.531
But we're not dealing
with one person here.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.284
Word is out.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.828
Everyone knows.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.792
Guards and inmates, it seems
they know I'm cooperating with you.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.879
Which you are going to continue to do,
Mr. Fisk.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.380
This was not a one-off.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.259
You want us to help Vanessa
clear herself of criminal charges,

17:32.342 --> 17:35.137
you need to continue
to deliver actionable information.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.638
Do you understand?

17:37.347 --> 17:38.474
[inhales]

17:40.059 --> 17:43.979
I have suddenly become a target
within these walls here.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.398
Do you understand?

17:49.234 --> 17:51.528
I'm helping you to help Vanessa.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.912
I can't do either of those things
if I'm dead.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.980
[indistinct whispering]

18:28.190 --> 18:31.610
-[woman whispering] Please, God...
-If you can help, please just...

18:31.693 --> 18:33.028
[man] Help me get this job.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.990
I've got to keep paying them,
or they'll come for Mindy.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.076
[overlapping indistinct whispering]

18:41.286 --> 18:43.080
[sobs] Please just call her home.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.291
End her suffering, I beg you.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.627
-Her moans, I...
-[man whispering] Give Derek justice.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.840
Please, God,
you know he didn't do this thing.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.425
That lawyer's no damn good,

18:56.176 --> 18:58.095
but you can touch the jury, God.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.973
Help them to see the truth.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.315
[Lantom] Glad to see you up here, Matthew.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.068
I used to listen to people's prayers.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.904
In here and out on the street.

19:15.988 --> 19:22.619
You know, people asking for God's help
or justice or... vengeance sometimes.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.788
See, it's always the same.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.541
"Please, God."

19:31.086 --> 19:33.714
I thought that God
let me hear the prayers...

19:34.756 --> 19:36.216
so that I could answer.

19:37.634 --> 19:42.556
So that's what I did. That's what I was
trying to do, was trying to help people.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.350
But I am not what I was.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.480
Can't do what I used to do.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.775
Give it time.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.988
Whatever your new reality is,
you'll adjust.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.367
When I heard all those prayers,
all those...

20:03.285 --> 20:07.122
suffering people,
I thought it was God's voice.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.169
But I was wrong.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.172
All I ever heard was people in pain.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.384
And all he ever gave any of us was...

20:22.054 --> 20:23.263
silence.

20:24.223 --> 20:31.063
So now you believe your calling
to do what you do was a mistake?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.315
I was deluding myself.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.903
Maybe that's a good thing
to realize, Matthew.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.863
Maybe...

20:41.198 --> 20:42.741
it's time for you to stop.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.284
Oh... [chuckles]

20:45.244 --> 20:46.995
No, Father, uh...

20:48.997 --> 20:52.251
My delusion was thinking
God had anything to do with it.

20:54.461 --> 20:57.130
I'm not as capable as I was, but...

20:58.966 --> 21:00.968
I don't get to choose who I am.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.096
I'm Daredevil.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.642
Not even God can stop that now.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.124
-Excuse me. I'm looking for a dry cleaner.
-Not doing pickups right now.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.375
But we're on 14th Street.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.210
Address is on the side there.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.422
[chuckles] Here's where it gets awkward.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.799
I'm actually looking
for a different place.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.135
I got a whiff
of their delivery van last night.

21:43.218 --> 21:48.015
It didn't smell like this.
Not like chemicals. It was more... herbal.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.559
Kinda grassy, maybe?

21:50.642 --> 21:51.768
Yeah, sure, like that.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.395
I know the place.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.531
[speaking indistinctly]

22:16.793 --> 22:17.794
[Karen] How is he?

22:19.796 --> 22:21.298
You're a journalist, aren't you?

22:23.467 --> 22:27.179
-I've seen your picture in the <i>Bulletin.</i>
-Yeah, it's Karen Page.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.182
Not to be a bitch,
but I don't want this in the papers.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.226
No, you're not a bitch. I get it.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.394
Then go.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.652
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
But you don't understand.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.322
You think because you don't want this
in the papers, it won't be?

22:45.405 --> 22:46.239
If I don't say anything--

22:46.323 --> 22:48.158
They'll make up things
that sound good to them.

22:48.241 --> 22:49.076
[sighs]

22:49.159 --> 22:53.038
And that's what will get written and what
people will talk about behind your back.

22:53.121 --> 22:56.249
For the next year. The next five years.
For the rest of your life.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.586
You talk like you know what this is.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.756
Maybe I do.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.135
You grow up with paparazzi
on your ass, following you to school?

23:08.136 --> 23:09.429
-No.
-Yeah, I did.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.224
You know what I learned?

23:12.307 --> 23:14.643
I learned that anything I say,
anything at all,

23:14.726 --> 23:18.146
you people will turn it
into whatever you want to, anyway.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.524
I'm not like that.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.192
Yeah. Sure.

23:23.860 --> 23:26.696
Believe it or not, I really do know
what you're going through.

23:26.780 --> 23:27.989
Your father almost got killed?

23:28.073 --> 23:31.243
Nope. But people said
that I killed my brother.

23:36.498 --> 23:37.749
God, I'm sorry.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.214
[Karen sighs]

23:49.553 --> 23:51.221
You know, when Kevin died...

23:52.931 --> 23:55.183
everyone wanted to know what happened.

23:55.809 --> 23:59.062
And I wasn't like you,
not paparazzi or anything, but...

24:00.522 --> 24:01.898
it's a small town.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.693
Stuff kinda gets around on its own.

24:06.486 --> 24:10.115
But since no one did know the story,
they made one up.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.533
It was all bullshit.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.663
If you thought about it for ten seconds,
it didn't even make sense, but...

24:17.205 --> 24:18.999
why should that matter, right?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.129
The problem was...

24:25.297 --> 24:26.131
[sighs]

24:26.214 --> 24:29.009
...once the story got out there, it stuck.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.888
It grew, and it got darker and, um...

24:33.972 --> 24:34.973
meaner.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.395
And the things they said
about my family and about me...

24:42.814 --> 24:44.441
it, um...

24:44.983 --> 24:46.568
sort of tore us apart.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.782
Piece by piece and lie by lie. And, um...

24:53.909 --> 24:57.204
I didn't really know
how to deal with it back then.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.459
Now I guess it's too late.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.628
You're right.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.466
-The truth can't be worse, can it? [sighs]
-[Karen chuckles]

25:11.384 --> 25:12.594
I don't know.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.306
I don't know if the truth
is any better, but...

25:17.224 --> 25:18.975
Well, at least it's real.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.022
[softly] Okay.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.529
Just take your time.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.116
We were at dinner.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.953
We were trying to patch things up,
you know?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.831
We were walking to the car, and...

25:43.166 --> 25:45.418
these two men grabbed my father.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.631
They tried to put him
into this van to kidnap him.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.219
We only got away
because the other guy attacked him.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.889
What other guy?
You said there's another guy?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.724
Yeah. He came out of nowhere.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.270
He had this black mask over his face.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.066
[Tower] <i>You're out of your mind.</i>

26:08.149 --> 26:10.944
Fisk's imprisonment would continue
at a private location

26:11.027 --> 26:12.862
under the constant supervision of the FBI.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.239
That's house incarceration,

26:14.322 --> 26:17.033
usually reserved
for white-collar criminals awaiting trial.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.327
[Hattley] He was shanked
by another inmate hours ago.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.830
Good. He's a cop killer.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.498
That wasn't proven in court.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.792
-[DiMolina] Whose fault was that?
-We put on a good trial.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.669
Five counts under RICO was a giant win.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.254
Which you're about to give away.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.172
You're the district attorney, Mr. Tower.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.341
Think of the long game here.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.636
We can't prosecute everything
Fisk is giving us at the federal level.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.804
It's gonna trickle down.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.890
[Tower] You're trying to buy the NYPD
with collars and me with convictions.

26:40.974 --> 26:44.019
[Hattley] When Fisk's intel leads
to the biggest crime drop in a decade--

26:44.102 --> 26:46.354
-[Tower] The guy is a piece of shit.
-You're right.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.110
Wilson Fisk is a piece of shit.

26:52.986 --> 26:56.656
After every time I'm in the room
with the guy, I want a shower.

26:56.740 --> 27:01.244
But let's talk about the Albanians
for a minute, what they have done.

27:01.328 --> 27:05.415
Four dead NYPD officers,
12 more riding desks with disabilities.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.834
One hundred and seven civilian murders.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.170
And even after five task forces
over seven years,

27:10.253 --> 27:12.797
to the tune of $11 million, we got zero.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.009
Those are some shitty numbers.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.511
But here's another one.

27:19.387 --> 27:22.932
With Fisk's intel, we beheaded
the Albanian syndicate in one day.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.268
One single day.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.563
No loss of life, no injuries, no mayhem.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.190
I mean, look at the take.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.818
We got their documents and data,
and we''re gonna get their money.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.030
Best of all, we bagged corrupt officials
whose protection they were selling.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.907
A lot of cases they've been
interfering with

27:38.990 --> 27:40.700
may finally get somewhere.

27:42.285 --> 27:46.206
Look, none of us like it.
It makes me want to throw up to admit it.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.877
But New York is safer tonight
because of Wilson Fisk.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.925
Now I need a shower.

27:59.344 --> 28:03.223
If we keep him talking,
Fisk will give up others.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.851
This deal will save lives.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.944
Tell me you're not going for this.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.285
[sighs]

28:28.581 --> 28:31.584
-[kids screaming] Uncle Foggy!
-[Foggy exclaims and chuckles]

28:32.711 --> 28:35.213
[groans] Okay, easy, easy.
Left pocket. Left pocket.

28:35.296 --> 28:37.257
You're gonna save them
for after dinner, right?

28:37.340 --> 28:39.801
-[kids chuckle]
-Don't tell your mother! Or my mother.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.267
[indistinct chatter]

28:47.934 --> 28:49.352
[woman] Hey! Foggy's here!

28:49.436 --> 28:50.937
-[all cheer] Hey!
-Foggy!

28:51.020 --> 28:52.188
Hey there, Counselor.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.232
"How are your briefs holding up?"

28:54.315 --> 28:56.234
[all laughing]

28:56.317 --> 28:57.318
What's up?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.987
Christ, that joke gets old.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.363
[Foggy] Gets old?

29:00.447 --> 29:03.616
Listen, Franklin, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.869
Hi.

29:06.411 --> 29:10.206
-Try a little. I put cinnamon in it.
-Mmm! Delicious. So good.

29:15.670 --> 29:16.921
Is he worse?

29:17.005 --> 29:20.633
Your father's arthritis
gets a little worse every day.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.888
He's having trouble holding onto things,
especially when he's tired.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.557
I see him with the saws and slicers.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.102
Ma, I'm sorry.
Isn't there anything they can do for it?

29:31.686 --> 29:33.813
There's no cure for getting old, Franklin.

29:34.397 --> 29:38.860
Your father needs to be on a beach,
not slinging meat in Hell's Kitchen.

29:39.527 --> 29:42.322
[sighs] Forty years is enough already.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.492
I know. You got yourself a life.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.826
A good life.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.204
But maybe it's time you came home.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.539
I'm right here when you need me.

29:52.248 --> 29:55.877
Your brother loves this place,
but Theo can't do it alone.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.879
Come help.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.465
Put those brains to work for your family,

30:00.548 --> 30:03.676
not every uptown shithead
that comes into your office.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.262
They're not all shitheads, Ma.

30:07.013 --> 30:09.307
[sighs] I'm not telling you what to do.

30:10.099 --> 30:13.478
You're a grown man. Just think about it.
That's all I'm sayin'.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.355
Okay.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.440
I will. I promise.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.025
Good.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.027
I love you, kid.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.865
Hey! I can smell the candy
from here, Ruthie! Come here.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.536
Where'd you get that? Where'd you
get that? Where'd you get that?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.162
[all laughing]

30:32.121 --> 30:33.498
-Hey, Pop.
-Hey!

30:33.581 --> 30:36.668
-Do you want a glass?
-Damn sure didn't come to chat.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.295
[liquid pouring]

30:39.379 --> 30:41.589
The suits I understand, Foggy, but...

30:42.465 --> 30:46.135
why you drink this expensive
crap is beyond me.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.095
[chuckles]

30:47.178 --> 30:48.680
[both laugh]

30:50.181 --> 30:52.225
You know how proud of you I am, Foggy?

30:53.059 --> 30:54.227
You're a big deal.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.231
-Which is what you always wanted.
-Did I?

30:58.314 --> 31:00.692
[chuckles] Ever since you could talk,

31:00.775 --> 31:03.528
you went around telling people
that you owned the store.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.489
They'd play along with it, too.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.825
-Remember?
-Yeah.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.413
I got it, Pops. I got it.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.332
Yeah.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.960
<i>Sláinte.</i>

31:28.177 --> 31:30.054
Your lawyer almost screwed up
the whole deal.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.474
Those terms guarantee my safety.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.810
Beyoncé has fewer demands.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.026
This way, convict.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.239
[door buzzes]

31:58.917 --> 32:00.752
[sniffs]

32:17.060 --> 32:18.937
You want service, you gotta get in line.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.648
Oh-- Oh.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.276
Come on, come on.
You got a ticket, you just picking up?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.486
-Me?
-Yeah.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.197
Oh, no, I just ran in
'cause your clothes smell so good.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.574
See, I got this real sensitive nose.
I thought--

32:31.658 --> 32:34.494
Yeah, we use a totally organic process,
latest stuff.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.412
Oh, cool. You got a flyer?

32:37.163 --> 32:38.247
Not in Braille.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.875
I-- I got seeing friends.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.086
Here, have a coupon.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.966
[Matt] Thanks, I appreciate it.

32:48.549 --> 32:51.719
-Glad I found you. Really makes my day.
-[man] All right.

33:44.439 --> 33:49.944
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

34:19.724 --> 34:20.933
[clattering]

34:34.906 --> 34:37.241
[man] God damn it.
We must have blown a fuse.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.160
Hello! You!

34:43.081 --> 34:44.082
[groans]

34:46.334 --> 34:47.627
[both grunting]

34:57.845 --> 34:59.972
[gasps]

35:57.947 --> 35:59.323
[panting]

35:59.407 --> 36:00.867
Yeah, I'd like to report an assault.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.786
I didn't see what happened,
but there are a lot of guns here.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.163
Maybe some kind of robbery.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.547
[indistinct chatter]

36:16.507 --> 36:18.259
I don't think I ever said it,

36:18.342 --> 36:22.013
but thank you, Theo,
for taking over the shop.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.473
They wanted it to be you.

36:24.557 --> 36:25.558
[chuckles] Yeah.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.644
For a long time,
I kinda wanted it to be you, too.

36:30.271 --> 36:33.107
-You never said anything.
-What was there to say?

36:33.649 --> 36:35.193
You got a head for other things.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.821
You were always getting the prizes
and scholarships and shit.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.825
Anyway, you can't make a sandwich
to save your ass.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.535
[chuckles softly]

36:48.372 --> 36:50.833
Theo, if we need to figure out--

36:50.917 --> 36:52.043
Knock it off.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.503
Go do what you're good at.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.839
You're livin' the dream.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.759
Am I?

37:00.676 --> 37:01.886
You're shittin' me.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.516
I had this idea
of how things were gonna go.

37:10.603 --> 37:14.232
Matt and I talked a lot
about what we'd do.

37:14.315 --> 37:18.319
Open our own firm. Help people. Get rich.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.906
I was the get rich part.
He was the help people part.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.328
When he was around, I knew who I was.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.747
Now...

37:29.830 --> 37:31.249
Matt was a good guy.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.460
<i>Sláinte.</i>

37:41.759 --> 37:42.677
[exhales]

37:44.428 --> 37:46.222
You can always come back here.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.933
[chuckles] Yeah, great. Thanks.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.355
[panting] Hi.

37:54.438 --> 37:55.439
Sorry, I...

37:55.523 --> 37:56.565
Perfect timing.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.859
Now everyone can stop worrying
about my career choices

37:58.943 --> 38:01.570
and start worrying about
me cheating on Marci. Much better.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.115
-Can I to talk to you?
-What's wrong?

38:04.907 --> 38:06.284
[whispering] I think Matt's alive.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.916
[whispering] So the guy in the mask,
he wasn't in a, you know, devil suit?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.127
No, but he was wearing a black mask.

38:16.210 --> 38:18.713
-So it could be anybody.
-It could also not be anybody.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.757
Hell's Kitchen is ground zero
for vigilantes these days.

38:21.841 --> 38:24.302
Believe me,
I want it to be Matt, too. But he's...

38:25.052 --> 38:26.053
-gone.
-No, no.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.681
-We need to get past that.
-There is no proof of that.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.851
-And until there is--
-You know how I know he's gone?

38:31.934 --> 38:33.352
Because if it was Matt,

38:34.103 --> 38:37.815
if he was really still alive,
he would've reached out to us.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.486
You know how I know that
you don't really believe that?

38:43.112 --> 38:45.573
You keep saying "gone" instead of "dead."

38:46.407 --> 38:47.950
Now, don't you want to take a minute

38:48.034 --> 38:51.454
and just be absolutely sure that's
not your best friend out there somewhere?

38:52.413 --> 38:54.415
I wish it was my best friend.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.251
But it's not. He's dead.

39:01.213 --> 39:03.174
[in normal voice] Karen, come on. Stay.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.427
[sighs]

39:10.723 --> 39:11.724
What? You.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.317
[gasps]

39:24.653 --> 39:25.821
Your father...

39:26.989 --> 39:28.282
he's in a coma.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.533
[Neda] He's alive.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.744
Why did you help us?

39:33.162 --> 39:36.374
The men who did this are in police custody
for another crime.

39:37.249 --> 39:40.336
You head down to the 15th Precinct
right now, you can identify them.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.462
You caught them?

39:41.545 --> 39:42.380
You should go.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.964
Thank God for you.

39:45.132 --> 39:46.342
He didn't help you.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.094
I did.

39:58.187 --> 40:01.107
[Ray] You will be under
the strict supervision of my team.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.526
You will not remove your ankle monitor.

40:03.609 --> 40:06.070
You will not pass beyond
the boundaries shown to you.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.906
You will continue to have
a strictly regulated schedule.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.367
That means eating, sleeping,
shitting, whenever I say.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.160
Do you understand, Mr. Fisk?

40:14.995 --> 40:17.123
I've spent much of my life alone.

40:18.165 --> 40:22.795
And for many years, I pretended
that this was the source of my strength.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.757
I told myself I had free will.

40:29.260 --> 40:33.556
And in that time, I achieved a great deal.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.686
But I was not fulfilled.

40:39.603 --> 40:44.108
I was longing for a connection
that I could imagine

40:44.191 --> 40:46.068
but I could not achieve.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.447
Searching and not finding.

40:54.577 --> 40:55.786
Until Vanessa.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.916
Until I discovered love.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.503
I thought I would explode
with the sense of power

41:04.587 --> 41:07.381
and freedom that she brought me.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.927
That the world lay at my feet.

41:14.722 --> 41:21.228
But then that passed when I discovered
the great lie at the heart of love.

41:22.730 --> 41:27.943
That what I took for true freedom
was precisely the reverse.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.240
You can build a prison of stone and steel,

41:33.324 --> 41:37.244
but you merely present the prisoner
with a challenge.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.871
[police sirens wailing]

41:38.954 --> 41:42.374
Any truly determined man
will find a way out.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.003
But love...

41:48.923 --> 41:51.050
Love is the perfect prison.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.845
Inescapable.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.932
So you see, Agent Nadeem...

41:59.058 --> 42:01.268
I am always in prison,

42:01.852 --> 42:02.978
wherever I go.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.900
And if these things
help me protect Vanessa,

42:07.983 --> 42:09.693
then they are nothing to me.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.698
I will do whatever I must.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.751
[Ray] Go left! Left!

he's en route to the safe house.

It's a damn shitshow.

47:24.424 --> 47:27.177
The FBI just let Wilson Fisk
out of prison.
