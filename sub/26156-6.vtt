WEBVTT

00:04.927 --> 00:08.177
It was Joy's wake and we were
both so blind drunk.

00:08.177 --> 00:09.412
Dinah, sorry.

00:09.437 --> 00:13.169
Detective Chief Inspector Terry
Taylor is just the man for the job.

00:13.194 --> 00:15.433
She's asked him to be her eyes
and ears on Friday Street.

00:15.434 --> 00:17.393
Especially you two.
Thinks you're up to summat.

00:17.394 --> 00:19.313
I thought he'd shot you. I had to
give the order.

00:19.314 --> 00:21.113
- Dinah, we need him alive!
- One, two, come on!

00:21.114 --> 00:22.704
We arrested your sister Faye yesterday.

00:22.729 --> 00:23.795
Eh, what?

00:23.796 --> 00:26.055
You're about to be charged with the
hate crime murder

00:26.080 --> 00:27.447
- of Abel Lander.
- Who?

00:27.448 --> 00:30.399
I'm a woman of my word.
I'll back you all the way.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.839
HEART MONITOR BEEPS

00:31.840 --> 00:33.076
CONTINUOUS BEEP

00:33.077 --> 00:35.759
Caroline McCoy doesn't know what he
just chose to tell us.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.860
Better still, she doesn't need to
know if he's dead at all.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.599
Has he gone?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.959
Far from it, Caroline.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.319
We saw a crash team dive in!

00:48.320 --> 00:49.639
They've identified a bleed

00:49.640 --> 00:53.640
which they wouldn't otherwise have
spotted, so... fingers crossed.

00:54.840 --> 00:55.860
I'll show you out.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.839
I'm with you, Caroline.
I'm fuckin' gutted.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.380
God bless you!

01:03.680 --> 01:07.680
Call Miller for wetwork. I want
Beckett's corpse shifted pronto.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.560 --> 01:17.570
Open up.

01:19.823 --> 01:21.439
They say you're asking for a favour.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.239
- Yeah, thanks, I was wondering...
- No, no, no, no.

01:24.240 --> 01:27.599
I just wanted to ask, who the fuck
do you think you are,

01:27.600 --> 01:29.599
asking for a favour from us?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.620
Is Beckett dead or alive?

01:32.320 --> 01:34.319
We working out how to spin our
defence, Dennis?

01:34.320 --> 01:36.719
I know Special Branch are involved,

01:36.720 --> 01:39.420
so I know I probably
won't even get a lawyer.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.639
He's a friend. We go back.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.239
Is he dead or alive?

01:44.240 --> 01:45.980
That's the very least I deserve.

01:46.900 --> 01:50.559
OK, for your information, I've just
come from St Mark's.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.560
I forget how they put it. "His body
has a medical memory of survival."

01:55.540 --> 01:56.959
He's gone back in to surgery.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.860
They say they're less worried about
him now than when he came in.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.940
Respect for that.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.239
Close it.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.923
You know, we can't let you to
talk to him, Bonnie.

02:06.924 --> 02:09.500
What you just did in there was
an act of cruelty.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.660
We.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.669
You're meant to be in the other building.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.919
If DCI Taylor realises he's seen you
somewhere before...

02:18.920 --> 02:21.919
Mind you, he probably thinks you all
look alike, the racist prick.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.540
You can't be here, Bonnie.

02:26.040 --> 02:30.040
RAISED VOICES

02:30.720 --> 02:33.159
You total fucking piece of shit!

02:33.160 --> 02:35.839
HE GRUNTS

02:35.840 --> 02:36.999
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:37.000 --> 02:39.119
Don't protect people like him!

02:39.120 --> 02:41.719
- Get off me!
- We were called to a rape.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.239
Aye, if he'd have been up to it,
that's what it would've been,

02:44.240 --> 02:48.240
but you met your match, didn't you,
freak?! Get off me!

02:50.520 --> 02:51.740
Get off!

02:53.200 --> 02:54.960
- What do I do with that?!
- What?!

02:54.985 --> 02:57.199
I've got that shit's skin
under me fingernails!

02:57.200 --> 02:58.900
Out! Out!

03:19.040 --> 03:21.860
I'd just got ready to go to
a mate's party.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.879
When the door goes,

03:23.880 --> 03:27.719
I think it's the cab turning up
early, so I open the door...

03:27.720 --> 03:31.720
...and he just smiles and hovers,
and says, "Hi, it's Dean."

03:32.000 --> 03:35.765
I says I've no recollection of him,
so I go to shut the door,

03:35.766 --> 03:38.919
he blocks it with his foot and
he pushes me back.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.239
I try screaming, but he shoves a
sock in my mouth,

03:42.240 --> 03:45.860
and it's a dirty sock and all so
all I can taste is feet.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.359
Then he tries ripping me top off,

03:48.360 --> 03:52.039
so I grab a ballpoint from the
table, I smack it in his ear

03:52.040 --> 03:54.900
and he goes down screaming and he
doesn't get up again.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.060
I couldn't let him.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.199
They're going to need to take some
samples from you.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.039
You do know he didn't get to stick
anything in, don't you?

04:06.040 --> 04:10.535
Er... But it says his genitals were
exposed during the fight.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.519
Oh, yeah.
I got that with my shoe an' all.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.639
That won't see the light of day
again for a while.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.358
I'm glad I paid what I did for my
shoes now, though.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.100
You never know, do you?

04:25.280 --> 04:29.200
Rapist introduces himself with his
full name? Dean Wayne?

04:29.940 --> 04:32.460
How's that smart if you don't
want catching?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.140
Unless he was planning to kill her.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.239
66...

04:37.240 --> 04:39.699
HE SPLUTTERS

04:39.700 --> 04:42.020
...St Stephen's Crescent...

04:43.160 --> 04:47.160
...Salford, S65...

04:47.200 --> 04:49.380
...7SC.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.959
What's your special story, Dean?

04:55.960 --> 04:57.799
It were an invitation.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.279
From Christine? Yeah.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.679
- To rape her?
- Yes!

05:00.680 --> 05:02.559
And what did she do wrong, Dean? Say no?

05:02.560 --> 05:03.940
Yes!

05:05.840 --> 05:10.080
I am in the As You Like It, the club.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.639
Being?

05:11.640 --> 05:14.399
A membership-only rape fantasy
forum, all right,

05:14.400 --> 05:17.656
which is nearly 300 quid a year!

05:17.657 --> 05:20.039
I got an introduction,
do you know what I mean?

05:20.040 --> 05:23.914
I had to sign all kinds of... bonds.

05:23.915 --> 05:26.820
- "Bonds" being?
- Terms of engagement.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.976
You normally get a warning
if you're in for a pasting,

05:30.977 --> 05:32.460
do you know what I mean?

05:33.040 --> 05:34.879
They are the rules.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.580
DOOR OPENS

05:37.840 --> 05:40.279
I'm giving the rape case to DCI Taylor.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.719
Viv, no, he's not fit to deal...

05:41.720 --> 05:44.162
Well, it's pointedly not a
rape case, is it?

05:44.163 --> 05:47.759
Thank God. But the interview I just
observed makes it skewy enough

05:47.760 --> 05:49.039
to keep him occupied.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.439
We're activating your
Operation Dead Beckett.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.719
I'm about to break it to Terry.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.559
- We're going to need him out the way.
- Fair dos.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.924
Oh, you'll be gutted when it's
broken to you.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.044
Brief the others.

05:59.045 --> 06:01.759
Tell them anyone who wants to
pull out, it's now or never.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.399
Scratch that last bit, just say it's now.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.719
Joe Beckett's pulling through, Sir.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.820
We're unexpectedly hopeful.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.239
Are you thinking death threats, Sir?
We've all had 'em.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.599
Not as many as me.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.799
When the Diddums brothers went to
jail and sent me threats,

06:17.800 --> 06:19.719
I got drunk and wrote back to 'em.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.199
"Get your facts right,

06:21.200 --> 06:24.959
"Maisie Gillespie was in charge of
that team. Pick on her."

06:24.960 --> 06:28.960
And that's how I ended up back
at the bottom.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.519
Still, at least I don't have a
death on my Christian conscience.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.319
Oh, he's still pissing down his
leg and slavering a grudge,

06:36.320 --> 06:37.639
but given the original odds,

06:37.640 --> 06:39.519
we still have good hands on big evidence.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.399
Well, I appreciate the update, Inspector.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.140
Terry, erm...

06:46.880 --> 06:49.204
I know you must be up to your
eyes in stuff,

06:49.205 --> 06:51.119
but I've a favour to ask.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.959
We've an odd case transpiring.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.679
Now, it's going to require careful
handling by a senior officer,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.479
and I simply don't have the time.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.919
What are we looking at?

06:58.920 --> 07:00.919
It's an attempted rape case.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.719
She was home alone, but she
kicked seven bells out of him.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.399
He was the only physical casualty,

07:06.400 --> 07:09.799
but me laddo's a member of a
rape fantasy introduction club.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.039
He says he entered into a
contract with the woman

07:12.040 --> 07:13.919
for invasive rape fantasy protocol.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.340
KNOCK ON DOOR

07:16.840 --> 07:18.519
Recordings of the interview, ma'am.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.439
Oh, yes. Erm...

07:20.440 --> 07:23.959
Jonah, I'm asking DCI Taylor
to take over this case.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.559
- Ma'am?
- Oh, Jonah, you'll still be attached,

07:26.560 --> 07:30.239
but, Dinah, well, this case is going
to require more patience and

07:30.240 --> 07:32.999
wisdom than Sergeant Kowolska's
got right now, quite frankly!

07:33.000 --> 07:34.460
SHE CHUCKLES

07:36.460 --> 07:39.220
Terry'll look after you. Watch and learn.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.999
Oh, give me a minute to
break it to Dinah.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.159
No, don't sweat it, Viv.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.999
She's doesn't like me anyway.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.380
I'll do it.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.359
So, did this lass strike you as some
kind of head-the-ball?

07:52.360 --> 07:53.919
Not in the least, Sir.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.719
Well it's the "not in the least"
club that always turn out to

07:56.720 --> 07:58.679
be, at the very least, head-the-balls,

07:58.680 --> 08:01.460
so let's start there and save us
some taxes, eh?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.119
- The rape case, you know the one?
- Yeah.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.399
Deering's asked me to do it.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.940
Why has she asked you?

08:09.520 --> 08:11.500
What's the face for, missus?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.199
Can I buy another burner phone off you?

08:15.200 --> 08:17.359
Mine got nicked out me bag
last night, or I've lost it,

08:17.360 --> 08:19.700
- cos my purse was still there.
- Help yourself.

08:20.360 --> 08:23.199
Offer a good reward
and always take a gift.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.740
Those are just the ones I had to
confiscate from me mam.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.100
Just stick it in me joy pot.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.020
Come over here, this'll cheer you up!

08:33.860 --> 08:37.198
Terry thinks that he's breaking
bad news to Dinah over there.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.780
Viv?!

08:39.960 --> 08:41.958
- This is a joke!
- Hey, hey, hey!

08:41.960 --> 08:44.020
What the fuck?!

08:52.320 --> 08:54.159
Ma'am, we're all unanimous in
thinking that

08:54.160 --> 08:55.519
Terry is feeding back to McCoy.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.999
With respect,
I'd like to hear that for myself.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.559
THEY AGREE

08:59.560 --> 09:01.079
If I'm going to pull this one off,

09:01.080 --> 09:02.879
I'm going to need a covert credit line.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.679
There's nothing I can do on my own
active budgets

09:04.680 --> 09:05.739
that won't alert Terry.

09:05.740 --> 09:07.819
I've had an open dialogue with
Special Branch

09:07.820 --> 09:10.005
since before I resigned, it'll
have to be on their tab.

09:10.006 --> 09:12.999
Remind them, the last
40 grand he stumped up

09:13.000 --> 09:14.749
yielded very good rewards.
We got Beckett.

09:14.774 --> 09:15.781
He's not a bank.

09:15.782 --> 09:19.239
His biggest temptation is going to
be wanting a share of the spoils.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.780
It's going to be known as a
joint operation.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.719
Where did you just come from?!

09:24.720 --> 09:27.020
- Come in the side.
- It's locked!

09:28.320 --> 09:30.639
- Beckett's trainers.
- Oh, not on the granite island.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.670
Soles of which are caked
with layers of oil,

09:32.671 --> 09:34.679
carbon monoxide and human urine.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.900
So where does piss, oil and
carbon monoxide like to hang out?

09:38.620 --> 09:41.439
Car parks. There's over
1,000 car parks in Manchester.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.346
The trainers, if you'll just let me
finish the thought,

09:43.347 --> 09:45.433
also carry traces of freshly laid tarmac.

09:45.434 --> 09:48.809
Only three car parks have been
re-tarmacked in the last month,

09:48.810 --> 09:52.439
and Dave Hetherington,
a covert Albion donor,

09:52.440 --> 09:55.079
owns this one right here.
My guess is that this is where

09:55.080 --> 09:56.813
Beckett's been hiding
himself all this time.

09:56.838 --> 09:57.640
Well, if he has,

09:57.641 --> 10:00.679
it might give us some detail to make
Caroline take the bait.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.559
Miller, how soon can you get
a team down there?

10:03.560 --> 10:06.279
Can I ask, what is the benefit of
keeping Beckett alive?

10:06.280 --> 10:08.959
To persuade McCoy that he might have
struck a deal with us.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.839
We need to force her hand.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.554
We're on about actually wheeling out
a corpse to scare her?

10:13.555 --> 10:14.636
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:14.661 --> 10:16.239
- Yeah.
- I'm not touching it.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.118
Yeah, I know, state he's going to be in.

10:18.119 --> 10:20.384
Well, the last time I saw what the
mortuary team had done,

10:20.385 --> 10:21.924
he looked more shaggable than any of us.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.879
- THEY CHUCKLE
- My team are picking me up in ten.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.319
What do I do about my share for later?

10:27.320 --> 10:31.320
DOGS BARK

10:32.520 --> 10:34.719
Go on, seek it! Go on, good girl!

10:34.720 --> 10:36.700
Earn your money.

10:54.264 --> 10:57.503
Hi, Christine, this is Brady Manley.

10:57.504 --> 10:59.383
She's from the Rape Crisis Support Team.

10:59.384 --> 11:02.260
She's not with us, we just
arrived together. How are you?

11:02.285 --> 11:03.408
All right.

11:04.104 --> 11:06.322
DCI Taylor. Er, Terry.

11:06.323 --> 11:09.943
You been gardening, Christine?
I have. I live on a roundabout.

11:09.944 --> 11:12.820
They've been planting crocuses.
Nightmare!

11:13.344 --> 11:15.500
But it's a smell, isn't it, nature?

11:22.350 --> 11:23.940
Take a seat, please.

11:28.984 --> 11:32.463
- Had he done it before?
- His record's pristine.

11:32.464 --> 11:35.343
So, why am I the first, why me?

11:35.344 --> 11:40.900
Um, it's actually your own personal
history that we're concerned about.

11:41.650 --> 11:46.620
We have you requesting a hook-up
on a rape fantasy message board.

11:48.197 --> 11:50.677
- You have not!
- Oh, but we have.

11:50.950 --> 11:56.060
This is the ISP for the desktop
in your spare bedroom.

11:57.203 --> 11:59.700
Would you mind if I go up
and check on that?

12:05.084 --> 12:06.684
If you asked for it rough,

12:06.709 --> 12:10.709
changed your mind and said no,
the law's still on your side.

12:11.964 --> 12:14.820
It's Charma, this is Charma.

12:15.770 --> 12:18.130
- Karma, for what?
- No, me brother, Charma.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.395
He's the only other person that's
ever had me computer password.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.420
- How're you spelling that, Christine?
- C-H. The rest is the same.

12:32.584 --> 12:33.943
What?

12:33.944 --> 12:37.073
The patient in Beckett's bed has got
a totally different blood group.

12:37.074 --> 12:38.780
We're awaiting DNA results.

12:40.270 --> 12:41.278
You let him go?

12:41.303 --> 12:43.841
He switched the other
patient for the subterfuge.

12:43.866 --> 12:45.826
How, we do not know.
The medics only realised

12:45.851 --> 12:47.291
when they untaped his tubes and

12:47.316 --> 12:50.716
found his nose bent completely
the other way, like an Irish spud.

12:50.741 --> 12:52.781
So, you let him go?!

12:52.806 --> 12:55.646
- Hang on. Who're you contacting now?
- Above you.

12:55.671 --> 12:57.711
Cos if I am to be guaranteed protection,

12:57.736 --> 12:59.300
you need to get out of my sight, mate.

13:01.012 --> 13:03.331
Hang on, hang on, wait, wait, Viv!
Can you just wait here

13:03.332 --> 13:05.540
until somebody else turns up,
and then fuck off?

13:06.732 --> 13:08.771
Hiya, Terry, listen,

13:08.772 --> 13:11.491
Viv's incompetence
is scaring me shitless, now.

13:11.492 --> 13:13.811
And I will put that on record,
on Twitter, on YouTube,

13:13.812 --> 13:17.812
in the next hour if my security is
not doubled until Beckett is found.

13:19.620 --> 13:20.971
How is Terry only hearing about this now?

13:20.972 --> 13:22.691
I've sent him three confidential memos

13:22.692 --> 13:24.700
in the last two hours.
He hasn't returned.

13:25.478 --> 13:27.878
Because he hasn't received them.

13:28.052 --> 13:30.620
Your inbox is full, sir!

13:32.252 --> 13:34.700
It would help if he read any.

13:43.725 --> 13:46.211
_

13:47.412 --> 13:49.060
- Something wrong?
- No.

13:50.212 --> 13:54.212
Just some results from my GP
I'd been dreading, if I'm honest.

13:58.012 --> 14:00.491
But you're all right, sweetheart?

14:00.492 --> 14:02.331
Yeah, no, I'd rather not go into detail,

14:02.332 --> 14:05.651
but it's a weight off my shoulders.

14:05.652 --> 14:06.940
Medical weight.

14:07.412 --> 14:10.780
Listen Viv, I'm sorry
about how I just spoke to you.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.852
For your mam's sake I'll make sure
that you're covered, Caroline.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.489
_

14:33.692 --> 14:36.451
So, how can I help you lads?

14:36.452 --> 14:39.691
Charma, you recently went to court
against your sister, Christine,

14:39.692 --> 14:43.331
over the matter of 1.5 million
from your father's estate.

14:43.332 --> 14:45.531
You told your sister
you were gonna make her pay

14:45.532 --> 14:47.291
for contesting your father's will.

14:47.292 --> 14:49.091
I made her pay. I won.

14:49.092 --> 14:50.451
Last night a man forced entry

14:50.452 --> 14:53.131
to your sister's house
and tried to rape her.

14:53.132 --> 14:56.451
And you think that were me?
I'm alibi'd by about 200 people

14:56.452 --> 15:00.840
because last night I was picking up
no fewer than five industry awards.

15:00.972 --> 15:05.180
And that's the first thing you say?
Not "How's Christine?"

15:06.012 --> 15:09.931
If you and Christine were left
equal amounts by the same father,

15:09.932 --> 15:12.572
on what grounds was the will contested?

15:13.020 --> 15:15.492
Cos I had to issue a restraining
order against her.

15:16.020 --> 15:18.931
In one night, Christine
spray-painted all my outdoor

15:18.932 --> 15:21.691
vehicles with "thieving twat".

15:21.692 --> 15:23.291
26 cars.

15:23.292 --> 15:26.411
Which backfired on all of us,
13 sales staff and

15:26.412 --> 15:30.700
their performances because
she didn't specify which twat.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.611
Five different stencils she used!

15:36.612 --> 15:40.900
One of them had reindeer antlers
on it, daft bitch.

15:41.772 --> 15:46.780
Cos... Cos...
Cos it's like, February now.

15:48.052 --> 15:51.171
OK. Listen, lads, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave, now.

15:51.172 --> 15:53.291
- So you entered her house?
- Not true.

15:53.292 --> 15:56.091
And you used a password
on her computer, a password that

15:56.092 --> 15:58.531
- she'd given you in 2017?
- Not true!

15:58.532 --> 16:01.291
Your finger prints are all over
the spare bedroom and the desktop.

16:01.292 --> 16:03.971
Listen! It wouldn't take
500 quid for my lawyer

16:03.972 --> 16:07.180
- to zip your mouth so shut.
- Sir!

16:09.852 --> 16:13.852
Where are you going?
PC Mitchell wasn't finished.

16:18.332 --> 16:21.211
Yes, I stayed at her home while
my dad was still alive,

16:21.212 --> 16:22.851
before she made herself the enemy!

16:22.852 --> 16:25.931
And I've got a list of a dozen
witnesses who can corroborate that,

16:25.932 --> 16:27.811
going back at least two years.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.611
Of course my dabs are all over the place.

16:29.612 --> 16:31.691
Presumably not in the last
eight weeks, though?

16:31.692 --> 16:34.691
- Not by invitation, anyway?
- Course not, it had kicked off.

16:34.692 --> 16:38.451
So how are your prints on a
brand-new track pad that she bought

16:38.452 --> 16:40.340
only two weeks ago?

16:41.212 --> 16:42.411
Better than that, mate,

16:42.412 --> 16:46.371
you also sorta checked your bank
account whilst on her laptop,

16:46.372 --> 16:49.771
just after you put her
name on the website.

16:49.772 --> 16:52.531
You can delete search history
all you like to dodge the wife,

16:52.532 --> 16:54.731
but we have means.

16:54.732 --> 16:56.260
Whoops!

16:56.665 --> 17:01.012
You stripped her of everything
for your father's money.

17:01.172 --> 17:03.060
Wasn't that enough?

17:06.852 --> 17:09.891
The information that you are about
to see will remain confidential

17:09.892 --> 17:13.953
to the people in this room only
and no written reference anywhere.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.380
Are we clear?

17:16.452 --> 17:18.050
- Oh, and...
- With respect,

17:18.051 --> 17:19.491
I'm busting my nuts here waiting

17:19.492 --> 17:22.180
to see their faces, Ma'am,
so, can we get on?

17:24.092 --> 17:26.851
This car hasn't been moved for weeks,

17:26.852 --> 17:28.891
the attendant says
it's on a long stay ticket.

17:28.892 --> 17:32.171
Cloned plates,
Beckett's name is nowhere near it.

17:32.172 --> 17:34.491
There's very little to look at,

17:34.492 --> 17:38.411
but the interior is
crawling with Beckett's DNA.

17:38.412 --> 17:41.251
We found this receipt scrunched
under the passenger seat

17:41.252 --> 17:44.771
for provisions from the 7-Elevensis
nearest the car park,

17:44.772 --> 17:47.491
cash sale, there's no traceable card.

17:47.492 --> 17:50.691
So, footage from said
branch of 7-Elevensis.

17:50.692 --> 17:54.068
Focus on the female with sunglasses
and a hoodie

17:54.735 --> 17:56.980
when she reachesfor her purse...

17:58.852 --> 18:01.411
- Caroline McCoy!
- Jesus.

18:01.412 --> 18:05.642
The receipt found in the footwell
means we can directly connect her

18:05.643 --> 18:09.091
to Beckett from
the contents of that sale.

18:09.092 --> 18:12.011
No way are we going to court
with this. Only this.

18:12.012 --> 18:14.359
- But, it short cuts everything!
- Yeah, it does.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.811
No, she'll just say that her bag
just got lifted, off-camera.

18:16.812 --> 18:19.491
That's not what I'm on about.
If we ask McCoy to meet Beckett

18:19.492 --> 18:20.891
where they usually met,

18:20.892 --> 18:25.300
and she shows up with that 100k,
we'll have her on all counts.

18:25.532 --> 18:28.371
She's needs to see Beckett to
believe him. With moving parts.

18:28.372 --> 18:31.691
McCoy is doing a public Q&A
at the townhall later.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.611
The crowd'll mean
she can't get too close.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.931
Could do if you wanted to.
I got the lads at the mortuary

18:35.932 --> 18:38.931
to load him with a latex
and formaldehyde combo.

18:38.932 --> 18:40.611
You could probably literally get

18:40.612 --> 18:42.971
Beckett to bend over backwards for you.

18:42.972 --> 18:45.811
Right, these two we know
as regular line-up volunteers.

18:45.812 --> 18:49.260
But, with a good make-up artist...

18:49.812 --> 18:51.143
- I know one.
- I know one.

18:51.168 --> 18:53.836
Yeah, mine's already working for us.

18:57.172 --> 19:01.172
Ma'am, Sarge, get over here.

19:08.612 --> 19:10.220
What?

19:16.370 --> 19:17.580
Terry!

19:18.572 --> 19:20.731
Ah! I tried to find you.

19:20.732 --> 19:23.051
I thought you were still interrogating?

19:23.052 --> 19:25.531
Sorry, Sir, can I get
my phone back, please?

19:25.532 --> 19:29.091
- Sir's ran out of juice, Ma'am.
- I was after saying, "Ta-da!"

19:29.092 --> 19:32.131
Me and my lad just nailed about
12 decent convictions on them.

19:32.132 --> 19:35.851
- Motive?
- Oh, same-old, same-old. Born shite.

19:35.852 --> 19:39.987
Oh, and listen, I used all my juice
trying to clear out the backlog of

19:40.012 --> 19:42.054
messages and e-mails from all of you lot,

19:42.055 --> 19:44.057
most of 'em saying not enough.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.171
Now, I've told Madam Mayor that it
was an embarrassing lapse of

19:47.172 --> 19:50.340
communication that won't happen again.

19:53.611 --> 19:57.611
Come on. Jonah, how quietly
can you get us in there?

19:58.172 --> 19:59.980
Who's us, Ma'am?

20:01.012 --> 20:03.411
Terry has just shot into the lavs
with potentially several

20:03.412 --> 20:04.531
strands of information.

20:04.532 --> 20:08.532
Now, I need to know who
he's talking to on your phone.

20:20.492 --> 20:24.011
He... He's, um...

20:24.012 --> 20:25.820
knocking one out.

20:26.492 --> 20:30.100
Who in God's name cracks
a rape case and goes for a wank?

20:33.532 --> 20:36.180
- Phone... Two minutes.
- What the...!

20:42.372 --> 20:46.372
GROANING

20:47.420 --> 20:49.060
MOANING

20:53.460 --> 20:55.091
FEMALE VOICE: 'Oh! Oh!'

20:55.092 --> 20:56.500
Oh!

20:58.140 --> 21:00.620
GROANING

21:20.292 --> 21:21.971
CLATTERING

21:21.972 --> 21:23.060
Argh!

21:23.492 --> 21:24.851
CHOKING

21:24.852 --> 21:26.620
THUMP

21:29.076 --> 21:32.195
Oh, fuck! Quick. Terry's collapsed.

21:32.196 --> 21:34.371
He's stuck in the cubicle!
Somebody get an ambulance!

21:34.372 --> 21:36.731
Where's the defibrillator?
We think he's having a heart attack!

21:36.732 --> 21:39.211
- In the middle of a wank!
- Hiya, Trish, it's Tegan.

21:39.212 --> 21:41.379
We've got a medical
emergency on our floor.

21:41.380 --> 21:44.571
Terry Taylor, 50-odd-year-old male,
somebody said he's having an

21:44.572 --> 21:46.620
heart attack, so just get
the guys to step on it, yeah?

21:48.452 --> 21:50.011
Oi! Are you not coming?

21:50.012 --> 21:53.300
If he died during a wank, he's
still gonna have his knob out. No.

21:58.252 --> 22:02.368
He's not breathing. No pulse.
Hurry up with that de-fib.

22:02.393 --> 22:03.387
Cut that.

22:15.372 --> 22:19.372
Can we cover that up before
we zap him, just in case?

22:21.452 --> 22:25.189
- All clear.
- 'Stand clear.'

22:25.190 --> 22:28.140
- Shocking.
- 'Shock delivered.'

22:48.338 --> 22:50.320
- Right, what's going on?
- He's pulling through.

22:50.345 --> 22:53.482
We're not yet sure what's
medically pertaining, but...

22:53.918 --> 22:56.278
...he dropped like a sack of
shit knocking one out!

22:56.303 --> 22:58.023
Oh, you're not making this up!

22:58.218 --> 23:00.617
You couldn't know that unless
someone else was there.

23:00.618 --> 23:03.617
He had his iPad with him, still
linked to a police fetish site.

23:03.618 --> 23:05.380
Not an ounce of imagination.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.817
Truth be told,
I put him to good work today,

23:08.818 --> 23:11.937
and I bet it was a full eight hour
day that popped his nuts.

23:11.938 --> 23:13.897
Oh, you put a senior officer
to good work?

23:13.898 --> 23:16.937
Yes! To very good results, two
solid convictions.

23:16.938 --> 23:20.220
Oh, fine. I will remember how you
used that phrase, Inspector.

23:23.098 --> 23:25.820
Listen, whatever we end up doing,
no-one's going near me hair.

23:27.204 --> 23:28.980
Best check if she's here.

23:33.637 --> 23:34.940
You all right?

23:35.578 --> 23:37.060
Hey, you're shaking.

23:37.738 --> 23:39.980
I badly need this to work, Spike.

23:40.618 --> 23:43.900
- I want...
- Hey, we.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.600
We need to string Caroline McCoy up,

23:48.820 --> 23:50.604
or I'm taking her out myself.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.140
We, Dinah.

23:57.538 --> 24:00.180
I can't stop thinking about Joy.

24:01.577 --> 24:02.977
Hey, hey.

24:03.178 --> 24:04.580
Hey.

24:06.938 --> 24:08.780
I can't stop thinking about you.

24:17.618 --> 24:19.060
Welcome back, Ma'am.

24:19.698 --> 24:21.420
Same from all of us, Ma'am.

24:22.178 --> 24:23.820
Despite the circumstances.

24:25.658 --> 24:28.577
Yeah, Dinah was just reminding me
why we're giving this all we've got.

24:28.578 --> 24:31.657
Full house!
Spike, this is Ginny the Spinner.

24:31.658 --> 24:33.457
All right, let's get cracking, love.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.793
You can do what you want with my hair.

24:34.818 --> 24:36.620
- All right.
- Within reason.

24:41.858 --> 24:45.817
Look at this e-mail. That's Caroline
McCoy's running order for tonight.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.937
She's virtually written Terry's
script for him.

24:47.938 --> 24:50.257
It's a lousy script.
He's never sounded this bright.

24:50.258 --> 24:53.297
Oh, I love this bit
"As heckler will be evicted,

24:53.298 --> 24:55.937
Caroline McCoy will call him back
and address his questions."

24:55.938 --> 24:58.777
Fucking fraud! Her mother'll be
turning in her grave.

24:58.778 --> 25:00.449
Yeah, but look at what this was
all set up for.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.595
She's going to disband every council
member

25:02.596 --> 25:04.389
and get them to reapply for their jobs.

25:04.390 --> 25:07.817
McCoy already sees Beckett's
demands as credible,

25:07.818 --> 25:10.257
but we are going to plant
Spike-as-Beckett in the town hall.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.093
Now the receipt we can peg on her,

25:12.094 --> 25:15.577
as long as she turns up at the
correct, undisclosed, location.

25:15.578 --> 25:17.257
And there's no reason to think she won't.

25:17.258 --> 25:21.258
Your team needs to know if this
backfires, that's the lot of us.

25:22.018 --> 25:23.900
Which dress for tonight?

25:25.378 --> 25:26.784
I'm inspired by the red.

25:26.785 --> 25:29.349
Fine, but I'm not going to sit and
watch you trying on clothes again.

25:29.350 --> 25:31.027
It's like severe delays on a
long-haul flight.

25:31.028 --> 25:33.153
I'm going to take this to Terry myself,

25:33.154 --> 25:35.577
once the lab have copied
the shit out of it.

25:35.578 --> 25:38.411
Miller'll be three times faster,
with ten times less risk of

25:38.412 --> 25:40.340
yakety-yak from any fifth columnists.

25:43.298 --> 25:44.337
Stuart's had a call.

25:44.338 --> 25:45.867
Someone's come through with my phone.

25:45.868 --> 25:48.977
- Oh. Decent reward?
- Well, I offered 20 quid.

25:48.978 --> 25:50.097
I only meant ten!

25:50.098 --> 25:52.777
Now you go and get your phone,
while Spike's getting Deadpooled.

25:52.778 --> 25:55.537
I want you back here for the briefing
an hour before kick-off, yeah?

25:55.538 --> 25:57.060
Yeah. Thanks, Ma'am.

25:58.378 --> 26:00.020
Let's smash it!

26:14.338 --> 26:17.577
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me?

26:17.578 --> 26:19.057
Oh, hello!

26:19.058 --> 26:22.417
Hiya. Are you Ruby?
If you are, I'm Tegan.

26:22.418 --> 26:24.417
I think we spoke on the phone?
About my phone?

26:24.418 --> 26:27.097
Oh, of course, I'm sorry. Yes, it's here!

26:27.098 --> 26:29.857
We've just found out we're being
audited in the morning.

26:29.858 --> 26:33.140
First time the shredder's
been used in eight months!

26:33.703 --> 26:36.445
Oh, I had no idea you were a policeman.

26:36.446 --> 26:38.617
I'd have never come out with that!

26:38.618 --> 26:40.817
Oh, don't worry about it,
honestly. Relax.

26:40.818 --> 26:42.217
Open the card. Have a drink on me.

26:42.218 --> 26:45.057
Oh no, I didn't find it.

26:45.058 --> 26:47.577
It was Mr Forster, the boss.

26:47.578 --> 26:50.817
But don't offer him money,
he's a born again.

26:50.818 --> 26:53.657
You'll make his day just turning up.

26:53.658 --> 26:57.161
Straight through those double doors,
first set on the left.

26:57.162 --> 26:58.417
Right, yeah.

26:58.418 --> 27:03.125
Sorry love, police or not, I can't
let any transmitting devices

27:03.165 --> 27:07.500
through, else we'll send all the
printers into orbit!

27:07.978 --> 27:10.984
Eight thousand flyers for a
village fete in Tabley,

27:10.985 --> 27:14.057
population, like, eight.

27:14.058 --> 27:18.058
Even car keys can block the
frequency sometimes!

27:18.258 --> 27:20.260
Yep, that's it.

27:40.978 --> 27:42.740
Oi! Ruby!

27:43.777 --> 27:45.057
Oi!

27:45.058 --> 27:47.977
You know what? I never forget a
face, you two-faced bitch!

27:47.978 --> 27:49.222
Who cares?!

27:49.223 --> 27:50.697
What?! Oi!

27:50.698 --> 27:51.737
Oi!

27:51.738 --> 27:53.377
TEGAN BANGS ON THE WINDOW

27:53.378 --> 27:55.580
Let me out!

27:59.018 --> 28:00.337
Madam Mayor?

28:00.338 --> 28:03.057
Just a second. What's going on, Viv?

28:03.058 --> 28:05.097
Terry's in intensive care.

28:05.098 --> 28:07.700
Oh, my God, it's not Beckett?!

28:08.058 --> 28:09.177
Why Beckett?

28:09.178 --> 28:11.097
Well, he's threatened everyone else!

28:11.098 --> 28:13.257
Embolism. I've been asked to take
over your security.

28:13.258 --> 28:14.420
Well, you can't!

28:14.858 --> 28:17.740
I meant... you've got too much on
your plate.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.498
Probably, yeah, but I came to be
near you.

28:20.820 --> 28:23.017
I helped you dodge the last
bullet, didn't I?

28:23.018 --> 28:26.337
Well, Terry has promised me armed police.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.418
Oh, they're under cover and in position.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.617
Don't you sweat,
if Beckett shows his face,

28:30.618 --> 28:31.977
I've asked them to aim low.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.417
They can blow his bollocks off, but
I want his gob intact

28:34.418 --> 28:36.660
so you and me both can hear what
he's got to say for himself.

28:36.857 --> 28:40.857
Your mam's on my shoulders,
so you're well covered.

28:43.938 --> 28:45.220
Yeah, thanks.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.098
Showtime, kid.

28:47.336 --> 28:48.503
WOMAN: If you'd all start
taking your seats, please.

28:48.528 --> 28:49.700
Yeah.

28:54.138 --> 28:55.177
APPLAUSE

28:55.178 --> 28:56.737
Thank you, thank you.

28:56.738 --> 29:00.177
He looks like me in Ibiza in 1990.
He looks like a Thunderbird.

29:00.178 --> 29:03.817
Oh, you look grotesque.

29:03.818 --> 29:06.297
I'm going to do what needs doing, I
cross my heart.

29:06.298 --> 29:08.457
APPLAUSE

29:08.458 --> 29:10.497
Take her breath away.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.900
That's the cue, go! Go, now, go! Go!

29:20.018 --> 29:25.113
This Q&A will be streaming live,
folks, so tweet any questions too.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.540
But nothing rude, I know what
you're like!

30:00.458 --> 30:02.620
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen.

30:03.138 --> 30:06.057
She's had a bit of medical news today.

30:06.058 --> 30:08.577
Use your imaginations and cut
her some slack.

30:08.578 --> 30:11.424
What happened up there,
I've tried to find you?

30:11.425 --> 30:13.780
Give us a call back, will you,
sweetheart?

30:14.338 --> 30:17.577
Jonah and Stuart will be in position,
she's headed towards Beckett.

30:17.578 --> 30:20.300
We need to get there way before
she does! Let's go!

OVER RADIO: DI Deering
to PC O'Connell, where are you?

30:42.389 --> 30:44.295
In position ahead of McCoy, Ma'am.

30:44.296 --> 30:46.255
Stuart, Tegan's been kidnapped.

30:46.256 --> 30:48.820
I'll send a unit to drive
you back to base.

31:16.656 --> 31:18.895
Where's Tegan from anyway?

31:18.896 --> 31:21.255
It's not Bangladeshi, cos we googled it.

31:21.256 --> 31:24.455
All right, Faye, whatever this is,
you can stop it right now.

31:24.456 --> 31:27.415
Were you just pretending to be
Welsh to sound invisible?

31:27.416 --> 31:30.055
- Didn't work, did it?
- My mum's Welsh. Blue-white Welsh.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.935
Listen, Faye,
you need to think this through.

31:32.936 --> 31:34.540
Your dad's not.

31:35.376 --> 31:36.615
You weren't.

31:36.616 --> 31:39.700
That's you, back in the day, right?

31:40.376 --> 31:42.335
How come you stopped wearing
the letterbox?

31:42.336 --> 31:44.695
You lay a finger on me,
and you could be facing life.

31:44.696 --> 31:45.975
If I get sent down.

31:45.976 --> 31:47.895
But it won't be for a crime
I didn't commit,

31:47.896 --> 31:49.735
like murdering some half-dead Jew.

31:49.736 --> 31:51.240
You were banged to rights on that,

31:51.265 --> 31:53.760
and you shouldn't have been so sloppy...

31:59.416 --> 32:01.735
Of all the endings that I've had
nightmares about,

32:01.736 --> 32:05.736
this wasn't one of them. Being
beaten to death by some fat bird.

32:06.496 --> 32:09.175
Come on, Cameron. You're up first.

32:09.176 --> 32:10.664
Did she have to hear my name?

32:10.665 --> 32:13.695
What's it matter? She's getting
torched with the rest of it.

32:13.696 --> 32:18.580
Oh, and when you get to paradise,
wait for Professor Miller.

32:18.936 --> 32:22.215
Tell him I said thank you
for getting me sent down,

32:22.216 --> 32:25.055
he's really made it worth my while.

32:25.056 --> 32:27.940
- Cos he's next.
- Come here!

32:30.976 --> 32:33.695
You need to know why this was sent to me.

32:33.696 --> 32:35.215
Faye Caddy took her, I know it.

32:35.216 --> 32:36.855
How? She's in prison on a murder charge.

32:36.856 --> 32:38.455
She was released on bail last night.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.815
Her lawyer said the only evidence
against her was forensic.

32:40.816 --> 32:44.420
And that Faye believed the evidence
was forensically tainted.

32:45.976 --> 32:48.735
Ma'am, she may have had a point.

32:48.736 --> 32:51.935
- She threatened my kid, Viv.
- Oh!

32:51.936 --> 32:52.926
Viv, all the...

32:52.951 --> 32:55.960
We need an APB on Faye
Caddy and all of Albion.

32:56.176 --> 32:58.175
Ma'am, we need to abort Operation McCoy.

32:58.176 --> 33:00.873
PC Thompson's life is at stake
and I cannot lose another.

33:00.898 --> 33:02.200
Agreed.

33:02.376 --> 33:04.675
Viv, wait! McCoy smelled a rat

33:04.700 --> 33:06.400
soon as we told her
Beckett was still alive.

33:06.425 --> 33:08.815
She's been years ahead of us
since day one,

33:08.816 --> 33:12.375
who's to say she hasn't pulled this
herself just to get us off her back?

33:12.376 --> 33:15.295
If we don't get her now, we never will.

33:15.296 --> 33:17.900
Stay on her, I'll find Tegan.

33:18.616 --> 33:20.980
Miller, go with Dinah.

33:26.176 --> 33:28.280
No way would Faye kidnap a cop,

33:28.305 --> 33:29.975
- she doesn't even know McCoy!
- Just listen to her!

33:29.976 --> 33:33.095
McCoy's set this up as a distraction.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.960
Faye was released yesterday

33:34.985 --> 33:37.120
with this judge's name
all over the paperwork.

33:37.496 --> 33:40.415
Den, please,
we both know what Faye's capable of.

33:40.416 --> 33:43.100
Who's left for me to screw over?

33:46.856 --> 33:50.856
This is literally a "stay out of
jail card" signed by DCI Merchant,

33:51.016 --> 33:52.920
saying you helped us catch Beckett,

33:52.921 --> 33:57.335
nail the Mayor and save a police
officer's life.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.815
Both your records will be
sealed by a judge.

34:00.816 --> 34:02.780
You'll get to know your kid.

34:11.295 --> 34:15.295
Our cousin, Cameron,
got out of Strangeways last week.

34:15.616 --> 34:17.215
He's devoted to Faye.

34:17.216 --> 34:20.574
His dad had an industrial estate.

34:20.576 --> 34:24.094
Cameron got it when he died,
it's got over 30 factories,

34:24.096 --> 34:29.179
but if Faye's doing invisible
shit, she'd do it in there.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.614
FAYE: Go on, Cam, hurry up!

34:32.616 --> 34:34.699
TEGAN: Get off!

34:38.576 --> 34:42.576
Right! Put it in its place.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.860
Fuck!

34:50.216 --> 34:51.900
Come on, Cameron!

34:53.536 --> 34:55.020
Cameron!

34:57.536 --> 35:01.536
What are you fucking doing?
Stop dicking about! Come on.

35:02.736 --> 35:05.180
Cameron, come on!

35:11.656 --> 35:15.175
Dinah, two kids coming up on the
right. They look like spotters.

35:15.176 --> 35:16.660
Be careful.

35:18.656 --> 35:20.855
OVER RADIO: I said spotters. Go past.

35:20.856 --> 35:23.215
What's she trying to pool?
They are not stupid.

35:23.216 --> 35:26.495
- Sorry, mate. Did you call in a leak?
- What?

35:26.496 --> 35:28.560
Gas leak? This postcode.

35:29.496 --> 35:31.975
- No?!
- There's a busted mains round here.

35:31.976 --> 35:35.016
If you can't smell too good.
Stay away from the drains, mainly.

35:35.380 --> 35:37.500
- Which drains?
- Any!

35:43.216 --> 35:44.660
He's calling Faye!

35:45.176 --> 35:46.616
Good call, Sarge.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.616
- MOBILE RINGS
- Yeah? How many are there?

35:51.216 --> 35:53.260
Right, just keep your eye on her for me.

35:54.576 --> 35:56.340
I'd want to see both hands.

35:57.976 --> 35:59.695
It's not actually moving.

35:59.696 --> 36:02.816
Find a natural way to show me both.
Then she'll know she's safe.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.591
How's the lighting look, if I do that?

36:05.616 --> 36:08.215
- It's perfect.
- Actually, yeah, that is perfect.

36:08.216 --> 36:10.615
Ma'am, she's less than two klicks away.

36:10.616 --> 36:12.740
OK, folks! It's now or never!

36:13.616 --> 36:15.055
Can't you see the signal? Move!

36:15.056 --> 36:19.056
Stuart, that isn't Faye, it's just
the mast, her phone's pinging off.

36:21.816 --> 36:23.780
Cut her throat.

36:26.536 --> 36:30.536
Viv, without another call to Faye's
phone, we can't lock her location.

36:30.616 --> 36:33.895
If McCoy's behind all this,
get her to phone Faye.

36:33.896 --> 36:37.815
We need another ping to that number,
or God help Tegan.

36:37.816 --> 36:39.980
You killed our fucking mate, did ya?

36:50.616 --> 36:53.260
McCoy's here. Action stations.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.380
Come on.

37:28.536 --> 37:31.460
You can fuck off, I'm not getting in!

37:39.216 --> 37:42.655
Caroline place that gun on the
ground and step away!

37:42.656 --> 37:46.656
- I said drop the gun!
- Drop the gun! On the floor.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.655
What the fuck is it?

37:50.656 --> 37:54.220
That's bits of the real Beckett.
Who died when you thought he did.

37:55.136 --> 37:57.055
This is entrapment!

37:57.056 --> 37:58.380
Right!

38:00.976 --> 38:04.095
Now they will let me smash
your lying teeth in

38:04.096 --> 38:05.455
if I felt like it which I do.

38:05.456 --> 38:08.319
You had Faye Caddy released
to cause mayhem.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.215
Faye has taken one of my
officers as hostage.

38:11.216 --> 38:14.615
You didn't intend the first cop to die.

38:14.616 --> 38:17.260
No doubt that'll prove part
of your defence.

38:17.602 --> 38:19.255
But a second cop?

38:19.256 --> 38:22.140
Call Faye Caddy, now.

38:23.216 --> 38:24.820
Where you going?

38:28.016 --> 38:31.255
I'll throw it! You two get behind
her, you'll be sound.

38:31.256 --> 38:33.255
Move!

38:33.256 --> 38:38.060
What the fuck are you doing?!
Idiots! Useless!

38:40.216 --> 38:43.615
Arghhh! My fucking eyes!

38:43.616 --> 38:47.616
Argh, argh!

38:49.456 --> 38:50.820
Fuck!

38:51.896 --> 38:53.740
I'll drop it.

38:55.576 --> 38:58.740
Right, so drop it!

39:00.296 --> 39:03.335
That was the first photo
that a guy ever took of me.

39:03.336 --> 39:04.628
Some white guy.

39:04.629 --> 39:07.415
Said he liked my eyes.
So I give him me number.

39:07.416 --> 39:10.055
And then he spat in me eyes,
and said they'd got me number.

39:10.056 --> 39:13.775
So, yeah, I ditched the letterbox
and then went back to my mum's name.

39:13.776 --> 39:15.615
Now you don't know
what you're looking at.

39:15.616 --> 39:17.375
Cos I haven't for a long while.

39:17.376 --> 39:20.295
MOBILE RINGS

39:20.296 --> 39:22.100
We've got her, let's go!

39:23.936 --> 39:26.655
Faye, you've just given us your location

39:26.656 --> 39:27.866
and you've given yourself 20 years.

39:27.867 --> 39:31.781
Now you could be 50 when you get out
and if you harm my officer,

39:31.782 --> 39:33.540
you're looking at double.

39:37.656 --> 39:40.455
SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE

39:40.456 --> 39:43.140
Get it up, get it up!

39:59.856 --> 40:02.540
Who's turn is it say cuckoo now?

40:04.256 --> 40:07.095
- Somebody tell her.
- It's diesel, not petrol.

40:07.096 --> 40:11.096
What? No! Argh, argh!

40:14.136 --> 40:18.520
When Dennis finds out what you are,
he'll cut that baby out of ya.

40:18.616 --> 40:21.060
Who do you think told us about
Cameron's inheritance?

40:21.829 --> 40:23.560
Dennis knows, Faye.

40:23.585 --> 40:27.185
And the only thing he'll be cutting
is his son's cord when he's born.

40:27.376 --> 40:30.215
No! No, wait, wait!

40:30.216 --> 40:32.375
Argh, wait! He stitched me up!

40:32.376 --> 40:36.215
All previous charges are dropped
because these supersede them.

40:36.216 --> 40:40.135
The only evidence going to
trial Faye, is you.

40:40.136 --> 40:42.175
Ow, ow!

40:42.176 --> 40:46.300
- Oh, my God, where were you?
- I was on my way, and I'm here.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.980
- Miller?
- Tegan, I'm...

40:52.056 --> 40:54.260
Words fail me, I'm...

40:56.536 --> 40:59.380
If I could do what you can do,
I'd have done the same.

41:07.296 --> 41:08.860
I'm so sorry.

41:09.856 --> 41:11.740
You were right, I'm a knob.

41:12.376 --> 41:13.820
A selfish knob.

41:14.536 --> 41:15.900
Thanks!

41:18.336 --> 41:21.180
Good luck. Call me?

41:22.696 --> 41:26.696
Thank you too. Probably won't.

41:39.277 --> 41:44.020
Ma'am. You know that kid, the boy?

41:44.736 --> 41:46.340
How old was he?

41:47.936 --> 41:49.900
He tried to rape you, Tegan.

41:50.656 --> 41:52.300
These are not kids.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.980
Dr Peep is on her way in.
She's all yours.

41:57.536 --> 42:00.420
SHE SOBS

42:17.216 --> 42:20.775
Stuart said that we got McCoy
banged to rights? So...

42:20.776 --> 42:25.380
...there'll be drinks, which,
Dr Peep can never avoid, so...

42:26.736 --> 42:29.300
...I don't want to talk about shit.

42:38.302 --> 42:42.302
Now, you sup up,
and you come to my office.

42:42.816 --> 42:44.420
When you're ready.

43:17.856 --> 43:21.100
I held you literally 20 minutes
after you were born.

43:21.776 --> 43:24.220
You were the size of a turkey
and you didn't make a peep.

43:24.896 --> 43:28.356
I'd never seen anything so new
in all my life.

43:28.357 --> 43:32.215
What you after, Viv? Remorse? Tears?

43:32.216 --> 43:34.060
I'll squirt plenty.

43:35.136 --> 43:38.135
I want my daughter back.

43:38.136 --> 43:41.135
You can fuck off with that,

43:41.136 --> 43:43.820
I was never your daughter.

43:47.415 --> 43:49.220
That was never the plan.

43:50.016 --> 43:53.495
Joy's death was out of my hands,
you know that.

43:53.496 --> 43:55.620
From where I'm standing,
it's all over 'em.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.820
I thought you'd love me being Mayor.

43:59.736 --> 44:01.300
I'd have had your back.

44:02.096 --> 44:03.935
Truly.

44:03.936 --> 44:07.100
You're not going to see daylight
for a very long time, Caroline.

44:07.816 --> 44:10.700
I hope you can feel your mam
on your shoulders?

44:11.936 --> 44:13.500
Cos I can.

44:14.536 --> 44:16.768
Do you know the first chapter
of the book I'll write

44:16.793 --> 44:18.560
when I've got any spare time, is you?

44:19.580 --> 44:21.535
Starting all of this.

44:21.536 --> 44:25.536
By pushing me into a bullet
that was meant to miss.

44:26.456 --> 44:28.740
I'll Beryl Cook you.

44:38.096 --> 44:42.096
I know you lot think I've only ever
read William Blake, but...

44:42.496 --> 44:43.900
Hold up, Spike.

44:45.056 --> 44:48.220
"Drive your cart and your plough
over the bones of the dead."

44:48.856 --> 44:51.689
Viv, Blake was a manic-depressive,
pick another, quick.

44:51.690 --> 44:55.220
It's not a suggestion, it's an
imperative if we all want to move on.

45:01.736 --> 45:03.300
Go.

45:05.456 --> 45:08.460
PORCELAIN SHATTERS, THEY YELL

45:10.536 --> 45:12.580
We're going to spend this on us.

45:14.456 --> 45:15.739
For Joy.

45:15.740 --> 45:18.660
But first, this is on me.

45:19.576 --> 45:23.780
When I say it's about leadership,
that's not about me.

45:24.496 --> 45:28.900
We've all led each other to each other.

45:29.416 --> 45:31.020
ALL: To each other.

45:32.136 --> 45:33.460
Well done.

45:36.696 --> 45:38.700
Keep Britain tidy, folks!
