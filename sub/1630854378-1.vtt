CORRESPONDENT 1 (ON TV):
As we enter the final week

01:30.548 --> 01:32.842
of this historic
three-horse race.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.719
I'm surrounded
by passionate supporters

01:34.761 --> 01:36.429
of a candidate
who burst onto the scene

01:36.471 --> 01:37.764
-no more than five months ago.
-ELI: Lucas.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.598
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Hey.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.766
Did you find him?

01:39.808 --> 01:42.185
-[indistinct chatter]
-Uh, no. Not yet.

01:42.227 --> 01:42.894
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
Where are you?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.271
I'm by ATB.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.606
SHARON (ON TV):
A story unheard of

01:46.648 --> 01:48.733
in the history
of American politics.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.860
One year ago,
former gold medalist,

01:50.902 --> 01:52.779
Nate Sterling,
took the political world

01:52.821 --> 01:56.783
by surprise and by storm
with his best-selling manifesto,

01:56.825 --> 01:59.828
a Declaration of Independence,
a modern-day common sense.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.872
CORRESPONDENT 2 (ON TV):
Here we are at Nate Sterling's
biggest rally yet.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.625
The independent candidate
has created a tsunami,

02:05.667 --> 02:08.461
thrashing its way through
America's two-party landscape

02:08.503 --> 02:11.506
as he leads Republican nominee
Patricia Turnbull by two points

02:11.548 --> 02:13.591
with just one week to go.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.802
The senior senator
from Tennessee beat out ten

02:15.844 --> 02:18.263
of her fellow Republicans
in the primary

02:18.304 --> 02:19.806
by courting both the moderate
and far left.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.349
CORRESPONDENT 3 (ON TV):
President Archer will need

02:22.600 --> 02:23.268
to pull off a miracle
to have any hope of securing

02:23.768 --> 02:24.436
a second term.

02:25.603 --> 02:25.645
With an approval rating
in the basement,

02:26.813 --> 02:27.272
some are calling
the Democratic incumbent

02:27.856 --> 02:28.231
a sitting duck.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.274
He's about to do a hit

02:30.316 --> 02:30.692
on Politics Nightly
with Jane Bower.

02:32.610 --> 02:33.528
JANE (ON TV):
Nate Sterling is set

02:34.612 --> 02:34.654
to take the stage
any minute now.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.364
Shit.
Call back when you get him.

02:37.907 --> 02:37.949
JANE (ON TV):
But until then,
I'm pleased to welcome

You're too kind, Jane.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.499
[Jane chuckling on TV]

02:47.542 --> 02:48.376
JANE (ON TV):
The election is a dead heat.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.253
If it's anything
like the last two elections,

02:51.463 --> 02:51.921
it could come down
to a few thousand votes

02:53.465 --> 02:55.842
and a handful of swing states,
or if it's a repeat of 2000,

02:55.884 --> 02:57.844
a few hundred votes.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.597
Your column is read
by a few million.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.015
Your readers
really listen to you.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.266
They trust you.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.726
I call it like I see it.

03:04.768 --> 03:05.727

Well, I have good news
and bad news.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.551
Which do you want first?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.303
-SUPPORTER 1: Bad news!
-[Nate scoffing]

03:40.345 --> 03:42.597
NATE:
Right! Always the bad.
Here it is.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.603
My little girl
turned 21 yesterday.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.021
[crowd cheering]

03:50.063 --> 03:51.398
[sighs]

03:52.357 --> 03:54.776
And the first thing Alison did
was make sure

03:54.818 --> 03:56.361
her voter registration
was current.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.779
[crowd cheering]

03:59.489 --> 04:02.742
Ah, 21 years.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.370
Those of you with kids,
you know how fast

04:05.412 --> 04:06.913
the time goes.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.873
And as I looked at those
candles
flickering on top

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
of that birthday cake,
it brought me back

04:10.959 --> 04:12.335
to the big moments of her life.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.713
Her first words,

04:14.754 --> 04:16.589
her first steps,
her first day of school.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.383
[crowd cheering]

04:18.425 --> 04:19.467
But then my mind wandered

04:20.635 --> 04:22.012
to all she's seen
in her young life.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.473
Terror reaching our shores.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.562
Two long and costly wars.
A great recession.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.105
A deadly global pandemic.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.940
Classrooms getting shot up
every other month.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.400
Climate getting harsher
by the day.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.693
SUPPORTERS:
Yeah!

04:36.735 --> 04:39.904
Our very capitol,
the people's house, under siege.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.615
-SUPPORTER 1: Yes!
-And the sad truth

04:43.950 --> 04:46.578
is one party fuels this rage
while the other sits

04:46.619 --> 04:47.912
on their hands
and whines about it.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.790
Now, you want the good news?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.750
SUPPORTERS:
Yeah!

04:53.418 --> 04:54.502
The good news is...

04:55.670 --> 04:57.672
my daughter Alison
turned 21 yesterday.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.799
[crowd cheering]

04:59.841 --> 05:00.759
And as she blew out

05:01.801 --> 05:02.344
those candles on top
of that cake,

05:03.094 --> 05:04.095
a funny thing happened.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.972
The flames reignited.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.475
So, she blew 'em out again.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.684
And then the flames came back
again.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.353
And no matter
how hard she tried,

05:11.394 --> 05:12.729
she couldn't blow
those candles out.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.523
And that made me think
two things.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.152
One, my wife
has a wonderful sense of humor.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.112
-And two,
-[crowd laughing]

05:21.154 --> 05:24.908
just like those candles,
we always come back.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.701
America always comes back.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.869
[crowd cheering]

05:27.911 --> 05:30.955
And we have to dig deep
and do it again.

05:30.997 --> 05:35.168
Because Alison deserves better.
Our young people deserve better.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.462
They deserve to look forward
to the future

05:37.504 --> 05:41.549
the way we used to, with hope,
with pride, with excitement.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.843
There's no more time
for cruelty or fear.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.055
There's no more time
for incompetence or inaction.

05:47.097 --> 05:51.101
Their time is up!
Our time is now!

05:51.142 --> 05:53.436
America's time is now!

05:53.478 --> 05:54.521
[crowd cheering]

05:54.562 --> 05:56.022
And if you stand with me,

05:56.064 --> 05:58.024
and you vote for me,
and you keep fighting

05:58.066 --> 05:59.734
for real change with me,

06:00.985 --> 06:04.739
I promise we will get
our fire back, too.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.743
(***)

06:13.415 --> 06:15.917
Now, let me tell you
how we're gonna do it.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.722
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
The general election
is finally upon us.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.432
And once again, we're forced
to choose

06:30.473 --> 06:32.934
between the lesser of two evils.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.020
On one side,
a Democrat in decline,

06:35.061 --> 06:36.563
and on the other,

06:37.814 --> 06:39.441
a Republican in the pockets
of corporate America.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.069
Oh, boy, our country is mired
in a recession,

06:43.111 --> 06:45.864
the whole world's on fire,
and these are the best

06:45.905 --> 06:48.033
two people we can come up with?
I mean, come on!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.785
Good luck, everyone.
We're going to need it.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.203
GORDON:
Good news!

06:52.245 --> 06:55.081
We've been bought again.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.459
As I'm sure, some of you
have already heard,

06:57.500 --> 07:00.587
Mr. Jack Hampton
is our newest overlord.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.923
Of course, I'm gonna try
to minimize the casualties,

07:03.965 --> 07:05.508
but it's no secret,

07:05.550 --> 07:09.220
our readership
is, uh, spreading thin.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.223
If we hope to compete,
we're gonna have to get down

07:12.265 --> 07:14.476
in the mud with the pigs.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.520
And how low does Mr. Hampton
want us to go?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.606
Conspiracy clickbait?

07:19.647 --> 07:22.067
Ten thousand words
on celebrity pets?

07:22.108 --> 07:24.736
We have to evolve.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.279
The only reason
we're not worm feed

07:26.321 --> 07:29.115
like half the other papers
in this godforsaken country

07:29.157 --> 07:31.826
is because we do not stop
to tread water.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.080
If we don't keep swimmin',
we die.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.164
You.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.958
I'm looking for new,
innovative ideas.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.545
Something that will ensure
that we are all still employed

07:42.587 --> 07:44.130
come Labor Day. Hmm?

07:44.172 --> 07:46.800
We need to win the battle
for Millenials and Gen Z.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.302
-Uh-huh.
-We-- we program
around the Facebook algorithm.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.054
Expand
our social media presence.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.098
He, whose name I don't care

07:53.139 --> 07:55.767
to learn, seems to think
that because I've got grandkids

07:55.809 --> 07:58.269
born before the Internet,
I don't know

07:58.311 --> 08:00.522
that we need to expand.
Of course.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.900
I have got a whole
fucking sweatshop

08:03.942 --> 08:06.695
working like a Russian
troll farm to expand

08:06.736 --> 08:08.988
our social media presence.
Okay?

08:09.030 --> 08:11.241
I've also got an army
of halfwits

08:11.282 --> 08:12.659
twice as smart as you--

08:12.701 --> 08:14.077
A high school in West Virginia

08:14.119 --> 08:15.912
is going
to a four-day school week,

08:15.954 --> 08:17.163
because of budget cuts.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.581
I had a call
with the principal--

08:18.623 --> 08:20.583
And how's that gonna sell
papers?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.002
I thought--

08:22.043 --> 08:24.629
I mean, cutting a whole day
out of the school week--

08:24.671 --> 08:25.964
What percentage

08:26.006 --> 08:28.842
of our readership do you think
has ever set foot

08:28.883 --> 08:30.176
in West Virginia?

08:30.218 --> 08:32.971
And as for the banjo-pickers
themselves,

08:33.013 --> 08:37.017
if it ain't Fox or Infowars,
they ain't readin' it.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.102
Well, maybe that's why
they don't read the Chronicle.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.270
They got a point
calling themselves

08:40.311 --> 08:42.647
the forgotten people
and calling us

08:42.689 --> 08:44.733
condescending coastal elitists.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.864
We are elite.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.323
And if you don't start
acting like it,

08:52.365 --> 08:54.576
you're gonna be a forgotten
person before you know it.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.996
The school in question
is 90 percent minority.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.874
It's gonna make
the achievement gap even wider.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.334
Of course,
the private school kids

09:02.375 --> 09:04.085
-are gonna be just fine.
-GORDON: What else?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.796
Hmm?

09:08.256 --> 09:09.341
Nate Sterling.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.718
Ah. You again.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.928
I hear he's jumping
into the race next week.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.097
And you think
I haven't heard those rumors?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.099
It's bullshit.
It's publicity for his book.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.642
My source on the ground says

09:19.684 --> 09:22.354
he just hired Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.903
Independents. They're like bees.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.072
Once they sting, they die.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.116
If he does announce,
he might buzz around

09:35.158 --> 09:37.702
the honey jar for a week or
two,
but nobody outside

09:37.744 --> 09:39.245
the two-party system
has ever cracked

09:39.287 --> 09:40.705
20 percent of the poles.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.873
Now, it'd be a fool's errand.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.917
His camp secretly hired

09:43.958 --> 09:47.212
a pollster to test his numbers
against potential nominees.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.006
When Turnbull secured the bid,
they saw a real opening

09:50.048 --> 09:51.132
for an independent like him.

09:52.425 --> 09:52.717
They know he's gonna have to
thread the needle,

09:53.426 --> 09:54.636
but it's not impossible.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.806
So, what are you suggesting?

10:00.141 --> 10:02.769
We get in early.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.145
Prep a cover feature.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.939
The wave is coming
with this guy.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.691
We may as well paddle out
to the break.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.111
Tell me why I would waste
my front page on this neophyte?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.823
Are you referring to me
or Sterling, sir?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.366
GORDON:
Both.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.703
You willing to bet your job
on this fever dream of yours?

10:19.744 --> 10:22.122
If we short him, we'll be
kicking ourselves later.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.957
But if we're early to the
party,
we might just sell

10:23.998 --> 10:25.291
enough papers
to give the Russian trolls

10:25.333 --> 10:27.085
an extra ten minutes
on their lunch break.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.130
[breathes deeply]

10:30.171 --> 10:31.131
Hmm.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.216
[clicks tongue]

10:33.258 --> 10:35.051
Fuck it.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.679
How can I fold
when a wounded cub is all in?

10:39.014 --> 10:42.142
Ackerman, you take the reins
on the Sterling feature.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.435
Choose your own co-pilot.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.686
I'll take Conrad.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.863
So, you're gonna give me
the source of Sterling's camp?

10:57.032 --> 10:58.700
Look, look, look, look.
I get it. I get it. All right?

10:58.742 --> 11:01.995
You wanted that story.
And that was a valiant effort.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.915
It was. But, you know,
karma is still a bitch.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.751
-And so am I.
-[chuckles]

11:07.792 --> 11:09.085
Come on. Look.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.795
It's a hard time for guys
like me right now.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.421
I mean, look around you.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.714
Oh, come on.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.465
A little awareness maybe--

11:13.506 --> 11:14.966
Okay. Thanks.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.093
Make up your mind.

11:17.135 --> 11:20.180
Either you're a victim
or a big shot.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.183
Kid gets to scoop Ackerman's
shit on his first cover story.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.810
And suddenly,
he's schizophrenic.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.895
[chuckles]
No. I was just--

11:28.188 --> 11:29.105
Were you just thanking Eli
for the opportunity?

11:31.232 --> 11:32.192
Yeah.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.240
I never liked that arrogant
little boat shoe.

11:41.242 --> 11:45.330
Email me the best thing
you've ever written.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.381
Which piece did you send him?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.383
The Honduran refugee one?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.968
-Yeah.
-Holy shit. He is gonna love it.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.430
What?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.431
Nothing.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.354
What is this?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.192
Now, when did you have time to--

12:14.234 --> 12:16.569
You've been working so hard,
I thought,

12:16.611 --> 12:19.239
"He deserves the finest grape
Safeway has on offer."

12:19.280 --> 12:20.782
Mm. [does chef's kiss]

12:20.824 --> 12:22.409
[chuckles]

12:28.790 --> 12:30.250
Penny ships off tomorrow.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.003
So, if my mom breaks down
in tears, don't be too alarmed.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.462
LUCAS:
Your mom? What about you?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.213
Remember the last time
she deployed?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.423
[Eli chuckles]

12:36.464 --> 12:37.257
ELI:
That's smart, buddy.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.259
LUCAS:
Ooh!

12:39.300 --> 12:40.468
-ELI: Hi.
-Hello.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.386
LUCAS:
Hey.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.848
To my beautiful daughters.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.433
Penelope and Elisha.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.102
One makes the news
and one reports it.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.311
[chuckles]

12:50.353 --> 12:53.356
Oh, wow.
You make it sound so romantic.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.608
Most days, I just stand
by the printer

12:55.650 --> 12:57.402
and get paper cuts.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.446
Well, you accepted the risk
when you signed up for the job.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.488
ELI:
Why don't you just go AWOL,

13:00.530 --> 13:01.990
and come bunk up with me
and Lucas?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.283
PENNY:
That'd be fun.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.451
As long as you're cool
with harboring a deserter

13:04.492 --> 13:05.952
with a warrant
out for her arrest.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.454
Let's change the subject,
shall we?

13:07.495 --> 13:10.165
-Eli has some breaking news.
-Oh.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.917
She managed to get on the radar
of one Nicholas Booker.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.919
Nicholas Booker, huh?

13:14.961 --> 13:16.421
See, now that's what you need.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.964
Your own opinion column.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.592
I'm not on the Daily Tar Heel
anymore, dad.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.136
Columns don't just drop out
of thin air at the Chronicle.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.472
Well, you wanna have a real
impact.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.308
Change minds. You need a pulpit.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.895
A column in the Chronicle
is like the pope's balcony

13:31.936 --> 13:33.563
-for Christ's sake.
-I'm working on it, daddy.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.149
I'm just saying it might take
a couple decades. That's all.

13:36.191 --> 13:40.028
The Dalai Lama was a god-king
at 2.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.279
LUCAS:
Man has a point.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.573
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.367
Mm. Wow.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.243
Does the man know
that religion and politics

13:47.285 --> 13:48.620
are about the only two topics
to avoid

13:48.661 --> 13:49.913
when you got a dinner guest?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.664
HAL:
Who, Lucas?

13:51.706 --> 13:53.333
He's practically family.

13:53.375 --> 13:56.211
Speaking of, when are you two
gonna make that official?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.046
[chuckles]

13:58.088 --> 14:00.006
LUCAS:
Have you got any new additions
to your collection?

14:02.050 --> 14:02.092
-No, but wait. When are we gonna
make it official?
-No, no, no. This is important.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.510
-[laughs]
-Right.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.894
You know, I never asked you,
which one was your first?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.647
HAL:
The day we realized

14:15.689 --> 14:19.109
the government had been lying
to us all along,

14:19.150 --> 14:21.653
sending me and my friends
halfway around the world

14:21.695 --> 14:23.446
to kill and be killed.

14:23.488 --> 14:27.117
Years after, Nixon knew the war
was unwinnable.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.410
LUCAS:
Do you have a favorite?

14:28.451 --> 14:30.495
He did before it was retracted.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.372
HAL:
That's what happens
when you play fast.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.915
I wasn't playing, dad.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.459
He played me.
There's a difference.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.045
Sweetheart,
you let yourself get played.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.714
Why don't you all come in here,

14:40.755 --> 14:42.590
so we can give Penny
a proper send-off?

14:52.475 --> 14:54.436
[indistinct chatter]

14:54.477 --> 14:56.229
RECEPTIONIST:
He's in meetings all day,
but I can give you his card.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.147
ELI:
Thanks.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.566
Oh, there he goes right now.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.984
That'll be on Saturday's draw.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.152
Thank you, Sharon.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.196
ELI:
Mr. Mayfield.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.407
Eli James, Washington Chronicle.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.075
You're the one
who keeps calling.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.243
I'm doing a story

15:10.285 --> 15:11.619
on drastic cuts
in public school budgets,

15:11.661 --> 15:13.163
-and it's my understanding
that--
-I'm sorry.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.289
I'm late for a meeting.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.297
Our boys looked good this year.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.631
We play like we did
against the Tar Heels

15:25.133 --> 15:25.633
in the ACC final, we might
really have a shot next year.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.177
You're a Blue Devil?

15:27.218 --> 15:29.179
Yes, sir. Class of '08.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.223
Ah. Well, I got a few decades
on you as you can...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.059
Bowties never go out of fashion.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.644
Listen, I gotta ask,

15:36.686 --> 15:38.730
how has the recession
affected your jackpots?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.357
Oh, as it affected all of us.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.358
The numbers might have dipped
but--

15:41.399 --> 15:42.609
Well, I would have thought that

15:42.650 --> 15:44.694
jackpots would rise in the
recession.

15:44.736 --> 15:45.945
How's that?

15:45.987 --> 15:48.156
You know, a lot
more desperate daydreamers.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.660
I think you mean grown adults
and valued customers.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.790
You should go grab a ticket
yourself.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.625
Gotta be in it to win it.

15:58.667 --> 16:07.592
(***)

16:13.014 --> 16:16.643
[indistinct chatter]

16:16.685 --> 16:19.104
8:00 p.m. tonight at The Monaco.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.272
If you're not early,
you're late.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.483
[indistinct chatter]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.040
I don't have time
for pleasantries.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.084
I've got a hit on CNN
at 10:00 p.m.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.254
What are you staring at?

16:44.295 --> 16:47.090
I'm sorry. I just have read
every single one of your columns

16:47.132 --> 16:49.217
-since I was in seventh grade--
-I don't need idol worship.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.137
I need something else from you.
Sit down.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.184
I'm getting out.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.311
As soon as this election's
over, I'm turning in my quill,

17:00.353 --> 17:01.438
and moving to the country.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.274
What? No, you can't retire yet.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.567
Who are you, my accountant?

17:07.027 --> 17:07.068
Well, what good are you gonna
do
out in retirement?

17:07.902 --> 17:08.403
I'll bury myself in Bourbon.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.321
I can read fiction for a change.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.407
And I might even watch golf
on Sundays.

17:12.449 --> 17:13.742
Institutions are crumbling.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.535
Okay? Reality is under attack.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.288
You're one of the only voices
whCome on. Come on.--

17:18.329 --> 17:21.458
Tweets with cats boxing yarn
get more eyeballs

17:21.499 --> 17:23.460
than a column these days.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.086
I've had a good run.

17:25.128 --> 17:28.256
But what journalism's become,
I'm done with it.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.718
There's a reason they tell you
not to meet your heroes.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.428
Then why did you invite me here?

17:33.470 --> 17:35.263
ENRIQUE:
Mr. Booker!

17:35.305 --> 17:36.306
And how are we tonight?

17:36.348 --> 17:38.808
Ah! Can't complain, Enrique.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.685
Isn't that your job, sir?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.354
Best steak in town.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.730
Only reason I allow him
to get away

17:43.772 --> 17:44.856
with being such a smartass.

Oh, right. Um,

I...

17:54.115 --> 17:55.450
I'll just have the house salad.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.828
Bring us two rib-eye.

get the rib-eye.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.545
And that's the last time
I'm doing it for you.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.632
Excuse me, Enrique?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.177
Give me the house salad.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.430
And the lobster tail.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.807
And may I?

18:21.393 --> 18:25.146
A bottle of the '04 Chablis.
Feels like a good vintage.

Lovely to see you.

Hi, Gregg.

for the run-up to the generals.

out of the insane asylum,

-but this bill...
-Good bill, Nick.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.308
It's Citizens United on meth.

towards your bedroom
door now that you've cut

19:13.945 --> 19:14.988
the chastity belt
off their checkbooks?

19:15.030 --> 19:17.866
Before you go defaming the FSCA,

19:17.907 --> 19:20.535
you might want to look up
the word, freedom,

19:20.577 --> 19:22.203
in your pocket dictionary.

19:22.245 --> 19:22.871
Turns out, people like it.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.622
Oh, relax. Relax.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.542
I'm not gonna write about
your Free Speech Campaign Act.

No? What you gonna write about?

I look forward

19:39.888 --> 19:41.473

19:41.514 --> 19:43.850
A good shellacking
from Nicholas Booker

19:43.892 --> 19:47.687

the fine print on the bill,

I need someone in my corner
on these next few columns.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.495
Gonna be short on time

20:45.537 --> 20:48.540
with the old lady trying
to nail me to the cross.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.292
Plus, my TV schedule
is wall to wall

20:51.334 --> 20:53.628
with the general heating up.

20:54.838 --> 20:58.299
You be my Angelo Dundee now,

20:58.341 --> 21:01.594
and I'll be your Don King
when I get my life back.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.971
You-- you want me to--

21:03.013 --> 21:05.306
I want you to help me
with my columns.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.476
[chuckles]

21:09.519 --> 21:10.645
NICK:
I'll-- I'll tell you
what I wanna cover.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.107
You assist with research,
uh, share your notes.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.359
[clears throat]
Proof my drafts.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.944
Why me?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.612
NICK:
Don't fish. It's unseemly.

21:19.654 --> 21:20.989
No, I just--

21:21.031 --> 21:22.699
NICK:
Look. You stood up
to Gordon yesterday

21:22.741 --> 21:25.118
when most guys
who'd been there two decades

21:25.160 --> 21:27.037
sat with pricks in their hand.

21:27.078 --> 21:30.498
And your writing,
it's got punch.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.335
It's raw,
but there's something there.

21:36.671 --> 21:37.756
Wow.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.925
In the interest
of full disclosure,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.636
I was fired from the Globe.

21:43.678 --> 21:46.931
NICK:
You wanted that felon's sob
story to be true,

21:46.973 --> 21:47.974
because you had something
to say about

21:48.016 --> 21:49.893
the criminal justice system.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.979
You let ambition and bias
blind you to the fact

21:53.021 --> 21:55.648
that that fuckwit had something
to gain by bullshitting you.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.987
Moral of the story,
always follow the facts,

22:01.029 --> 22:02.781
wherever they lead.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.574
Sometimes,
it's not where you wanna go.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.409
But you go anyway.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.703
Is that rule number four?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.955
No, that's not a rule.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.041
That's a commandment.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.836
Besides, that felon
had three strikes to his name.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.171
Why shouldn't you?

22:18.213 --> 22:21.675
Mistakes
used to make you better.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.594
Now, you're not allowed
to be human.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.388
Well, fuck that!

22:26.429 --> 22:30.141
You learned your lesson,
and I'm buying the dip.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.601
What do you say?

22:34.437 --> 22:35.563
Yeah.

22:35.605 --> 22:36.690
Wonderful.

22:36.731 --> 22:37.691
Now,

22:38.942 --> 22:40.777
I'll need your notes
on Sunday's column

22:40.819 --> 22:42.404
by noon tomorrow.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.155
What's our angle?

22:44.197 --> 22:45.699
Reporters
use their eyes and ears,

22:45.740 --> 22:47.742
columnists use their brains.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.995
We'll know what my angle
is by noon tomorrow, won't we?

22:53.707 --> 22:55.625
Yeah.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.127
ANNOUNCER(ON TV):
Well, if you think Archer

22:58.753 --> 22:59.462
has a grasp on foreign policy,
then tell me why he refuses

22:59.504 --> 23:01.631
to stand up to China.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.884
I mean, we've got ten times
the military spending of Russia,

23:04.926 --> 23:07.095
and yet he cowers in the face
of the Kremlin.

23:07.137 --> 23:09.514
Look,
he's just a weak president.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.516
I'm just gonna--
I won't say it.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.602
Republicans know it,
our allies, and we all know it.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.437
And let's be honest,
the Democrats know it, too.

23:15.478 --> 23:16.980
[hums]

23:17.022 --> 23:18.606
What are you so giddy about?

23:18.648 --> 23:19.983
-Wouldn't you like to know?
-LUCAS: Oh!

23:20.025 --> 23:21.735
[Lucas chuckles]

23:21.776 --> 23:23.945
[hums]

23:23.987 --> 23:25.113
LUCAS:
How'd it go?

23:29.117 --> 23:30.076
[chuckles]

23:30.118 --> 23:33.747
[hums]

23:33.788 --> 23:35.123
-LUCAS: No.
-Oh, yeah. It's coming down.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.125
LUCAS: Get outta here.
It's coming down.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.001
LUCAS:
No.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.502
[chuckles]

23:39.544 --> 23:40.712
-Go away.
-[kisses]

23:40.754 --> 23:42.088
-ELI: I got you something.
-Oh, yeah?

23:42.130 --> 23:45.508
It's probably worth $44 million.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.593
My own private island,

23:46.634 --> 23:48.928
so I can have some peace
and quiet?

23:48.970 --> 23:52.599
Aw! Where's yours?
You didn't get one for yourself?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.935
I already won the lottery,
because I have you.

23:55.977 --> 23:58.146
How come you're never this
sweet
to me when you're sober?

23:58.188 --> 24:00.940
Koalas are sweet.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.567
I am a lion.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.277
-Oh, is that right?
-A lion.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.029
-Oh?
-A hungry lion.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.239
Oh. [chuckles]

24:08.281 --> 24:09.532
-[smooches]
-Very hungry.

24:09.574 --> 24:10.700
Oh.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.535
Very hungry.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.789
CORRESPONDENT 4 (ON TV):
Breaking news
out of the Washington Chronicle.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.500
Olympic gold medalist
and best-selling author,

24:19.834 --> 24:21.211
Nate Sterling is set to launch
an independent campaign

24:22.337 --> 24:23.588
for president next Sunday
in his hometown

24:23.630 --> 24:25.048
of Portsmouth, Ohio.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.008
The reporting
out of the Washington Chronicle

24:27.050 --> 24:29.803
claims that Sterling has hired
the highly sought-after

24:29.844 --> 24:32.681
Kathy Gibbs
as his campaign manager.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.684
While history tells us
that an independent bid faces--

24:35.725 --> 24:37.060
The Chronicle?

24:38.687 --> 24:39.896
Oh, Eli, what the fuck?

24:39.938 --> 24:41.940
Come on. Everybody knew he was
running.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.233
It was like the worst-kept
secret.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.902
Kathy Gibbs. Nobody knew about
Kathy Gibbs. Eli.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.529
ELI:
I have other sources.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.031
I wouldn't have pitched it
if I hadn't double-checked--

24:50.073 --> 24:52.075
Am I your source
or am I your boyfriend?

24:52.117 --> 24:53.993
You never said
it was off the record.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.120
You can't be serious.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.913
Sorry, Lucas. I really am.

24:56.955 --> 25:00.083
I just-- it just came out.
I-- I didn't even plan on it.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.169
And then it was out. I just...

25:03.211 --> 25:05.755
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.758
Fuck, fuck.
Who are you calling?

25:09.884 --> 25:10.927
Eli.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.303
Senator Turnbull, please.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.972
What?

25:14.014 --> 25:16.975
Eli James
from the Washington Chronicle.

25:17.017 --> 25:20.645
Senator Turnbull.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.814
I was just wondering
if you had any thoughts

25:22.856 --> 25:25.692
on Nate Sterling
entering the race.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.028
Right now?

25:29.070 --> 25:31.781
Uh, yeah. Of course.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.033
I'll be right there.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.702
Eli. What the fuck?

25:37.245 --> 25:41.166
I just got an interview
with Patricia Turnbull.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.876
Now?

25:42.917 --> 25:44.794
Are you serious? You're drunk!

25:44.836 --> 25:47.672
Buzzed. And I wouldn't have
this interview

25:47.714 --> 25:50.050
if it wasn't for you,
so thank you so much.

25:50.091 --> 25:50.967
I love you.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.385
-[smooches]
-Wait.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.220
-Cold shower now.
-I don't have time.

25:54.262 --> 25:57.182
No, now! Give me the keys.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.643
Do not go easy on her, okay?

26:01.686 --> 26:02.771
Okay.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.815
Here.

26:07.984 --> 26:08.902
-Listen to me.
-Yes.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.153
Anything you have seen,

26:10.195 --> 26:11.780
heard, or read
under this roof...

26:11.821 --> 26:13.406
-ELI: Mm-hmm.
-Is of the fucking record...

26:13.448 --> 26:16.201
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay?
Especially in Turnbull's office.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.827
-Yeah.
-Eli!

26:17.869 --> 26:18.953
Scout's honor.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.080
Yeah. Scout's--

26:20.121 --> 26:20.872
[smooches]

26:22.957 --> 26:25.752
Just global response.
No, we don't go for that.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.712
ELI:
Eli James for Senator Turnbull.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.339
RECEPTIONIST 2:
Please sign in.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.924
She's expecting you.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.175
TURNBULL:
Come on in, hon!

26:33.718 --> 26:34.678
Where is...

26:36.846 --> 26:37.847
ELI:
Evening, Senator.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.099
Good evening!

26:39.140 --> 26:41.768
I noticed a Tom Mayfield
on your sign-in log.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.354
Is that the same Mayfield
from SuperMillions?

26:44.396 --> 26:45.397
You know Tom?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.023
ELI:
I'm writing a story on lotto.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.066
TURNBULL:
Oh, dear.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.110
That sounds like a real
tour de force.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.820
How do you know Mr. Mayfield?

26:53.822 --> 26:55.323
TURNBULL:
You see the one in the bowtie?

26:55.365 --> 26:57.283
ELI:
Oh, my God. Is that you? Wow.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.827
He thinks because we dated

26:58.868 --> 27:00.995
30 years ago,
he can drop by unannounced

27:01.037 --> 27:03.123
with all kinds of suggestions.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.416
[laughs]

27:04.457 --> 27:05.959
I love this town.

27:06.001 --> 27:08.378
It'll even turn ex-boyfriends
into lobbyists.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.921
ELI:
Hmm.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.176
What is your reaction
to Nate Sterling

27:15.218 --> 27:16.344
entering the race?

27:17.846 --> 27:19.139
I look forward to a healthy,

27:19.180 --> 27:23.018
robust debate on the future
of our great nation.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.770
I'm not too familiar
with Mr. Sterling personally,

27:25.812 --> 27:28.314
but anyone who aspires
to serve his or her country,

27:28.356 --> 27:31.860
whether it's an Olympian,
or a lieutenant, or a president,

27:31.901 --> 27:35.030
it is okay by me.
Off the record?

27:36.239 --> 27:39.451
Mr. Sterling is swimming
with sharks,

27:39.492 --> 27:41.161
and he can't afford a cage.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.501
How would you describe

27:48.543 --> 27:51.171
your relationship
with Harvey Altman?

27:51.212 --> 27:54.174
Harvey was my senior advisor
for many years.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.467
Isn't it odd

27:55.508 --> 27:58.386
that your most trusted advisor
splits to found

27:58.428 --> 28:00.764
UpRight Super PAC
just a few weeks

28:00.805 --> 28:02.223
before you announce
your candidacy?

28:02.265 --> 28:03.183
What's odd about it?

28:03.224 --> 28:05.226
Well, UpRight is raking in

28:05.268 --> 28:07.771
loads of cash
from high-dollar donors.

28:07.812 --> 28:08.938
As is their legal right.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.190
Thanks to your bill.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.150
My bill gives Americans

28:12.192 --> 28:14.069
the freedom to do
what they please

28:14.110 --> 28:15.236
with their hard-earned money.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.197
You seem very fond of that word.
"Freedom."

28:17.238 --> 28:18.239
Oh, yes, I am.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.200
It's what this country
was built on.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.785
For some.

28:21.826 --> 28:22.827
Hmm.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.497
There are reports that Upright

28:26.915 --> 28:29.167
has raised upwards of
$80 million in just four months.

28:29.209 --> 28:30.960
-And?
-Won't that give the rich

28:31.002 --> 28:33.755
an outsized influence
in a Turnbull administration?

28:33.797 --> 28:37.008
Oh, hon. You talk about the rich
as if they're inhuman.

28:37.050 --> 28:39.010
I started my company
40 years ago

28:39.052 --> 28:42.806
with one truck
and a whole lot of elbow grease.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.475
Surely, the American dream
don't make me a bad person.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.436
I see that same fire
in your eyes right now.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.480
You didn't answer my question,
Senator.

28:52.273 --> 28:53.483
Listen, Eli.

28:56.236 --> 28:59.572
Five million from a fat wallet
and a searing column

28:59.614 --> 29:02.826
from Nicholas Booker
are one in the same.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.203
Both might get me off
on a good day.

29:05.245 --> 29:08.206
But if you think they so much
as sway my stance

29:08.248 --> 29:11.126
on the renaming of a post
office

29:11.167 --> 29:13.294
in Wasilla, Alaska,

29:13.336 --> 29:15.213
then you haven't done
your homework.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.426
Why did you invite me
here tonight?

29:19.467 --> 29:21.886
[chuckles] Oh, honey. Relax.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.972
This ain't the principal's
office.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.515
You're here,
because if there's one thing

29:25.557 --> 29:27.892
I've learned over two decades
in these chambers,

29:27.934 --> 29:30.103
it's to keep your friends close.

29:30.145 --> 29:33.273
And seeing as you'll be helping
with the most widely-read

29:33.314 --> 29:36.484
op-ed column in this country,
I figured we might get to know

29:36.526 --> 29:37.819
one another.

29:40.613 --> 29:44.075
Nick is a cheapskate.
I tip Enrique way better.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.539
[indistinct chatter]

29:49.581 --> 29:58.506
(***)

30:07.599 --> 30:16.524
(***)

30:25.617 --> 30:29.537
(***)

30:32.957 --> 30:33.667
[door knocking]

30:33.708 --> 30:35.335
Mm-hmm.

30:35.377 --> 30:37.003
Nick, can I ask you something?

30:38.546 --> 30:41.257
There's something gnawing at me
with this whole lotto.

30:41.299 --> 30:42.634
What about my column?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.387
ELI:
Wrote up my notes last night.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.014
You were drunk last night.

30:48.056 --> 30:49.140
ELI:
Just hear me out.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.435
Lotto jackpots increase
during recessions.

30:52.477 --> 30:56.272
They have for every economic
downturn as far back

30:56.314 --> 30:57.357
as the data goes.

30:57.399 --> 30:58.525
And why should I care?

30:58.566 --> 31:01.027
Because not this time.

31:01.069 --> 31:03.446
Since the recession hit,
SuperMillions' jackpots

31:03.488 --> 31:05.657
have fallen
close to five percent.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.992
-Tragic.
-It's a complete 180.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.578
A behavioral impossibility.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.039
Human nature
doesn't just reverse itself.

31:13.081 --> 31:15.458
And SuperMillions
is the only lottery

31:15.500 --> 31:16.960
that's had that kind
of inversion.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.546
Wherever you're going with
this,
get there faster.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.214
Public schools that rely

31:21.256 --> 31:23.216
on that money
are getting stiffed.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.719
So, where is the missing money
going?

31:25.760 --> 31:27.554
NICK:
This better be good.

31:27.595 --> 31:32.017
The director of SuperMillions
is a guy named Tom Mayfield.

31:32.058 --> 31:36.271
Duke alum. Class of '82.
Senator Turnbull's alma mater.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.564
They dated in college.

31:39.607 --> 31:42.027
I hope you're not suggesting
what I think you're suggesting.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.194
ELI:
The same accounting firm,

31:43.236 --> 31:45.697
Meyers & Goldstein,
handles the books

31:45.739 --> 31:48.700
for both SuperMillions
and UpRight.

31:50.452 --> 31:53.496
You think that
Mayfield and Turnbull

31:53.538 --> 31:55.582
are embezzling funds
from the lottery,

31:55.623 --> 31:58.710
and smuggling
into her largest Super PAC?

31:58.752 --> 32:00.628
At the expense of our nation's
public schools.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.215
[laughs]

32:04.257 --> 32:07.052
Everything's a fucking
conspiracy.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.387
UpRight's books are sealed shut.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.222
Thanks to Turnbull's bill,
they don't have to report

32:11.264 --> 32:12.390
where the money comes from.

32:13.641 --> 32:13.975
It could all be happening
under the same roof,

32:15.185 --> 32:15.977
-behind closed doors.
-Don't be that guy.

32:17.145 --> 32:18.646
-What guy?
-The bug-eyed virtual vigilante,

32:18.688 --> 32:22.108
running a bullshit blog
and a libelous YouTube channel

32:22.150 --> 32:23.610
out of her parents' basement.

32:23.651 --> 32:26.780
Okay. Tom Mayfield was
in Turnbull's office last night.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.406
I saw his name on the log-in.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.741
-Maybe they're still fucking.
-ELI: Nick.

32:29.783 --> 32:30.992
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.703
-Um, reigniting the spark.
-I'm serious.

32:33.745 --> 32:36.581
Turnbull's a bully
and a misguided idea log.

32:36.623 --> 32:37.540
She's not a crook.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.671
All I'm asking you to do
is to, you know,

32:42.712 --> 32:44.631
go into that legendary rolodex
of yours,

32:44.673 --> 32:46.508
and make one or two calls.

32:46.549 --> 32:48.468
See if there's a relationship
between the top brass

32:48.510 --> 32:51.471
at Meyers & Goldstein
and anyone in Turnbull's camp.

32:51.513 --> 32:55.016
If there's nothing there,
I will drop it. I promise.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.397
GIBBS:
How the fuck did this leak?

33:00.438 --> 33:01.189
NATE:
All right. It's done.

33:01.231 --> 33:02.357
Let's move forward.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.650
This might actually help us?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.026
GIBBS:
How's that?

33:05.068 --> 33:09.656
A full week for the word
to spread means more people.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.825
A ton more people.

33:11.866 --> 33:13.576
Bigger crowd means
more media attention,

33:13.618 --> 33:15.704
which might bring us
an air of legitimacy

33:15.745 --> 33:16.705
from the jump.

33:19.416 --> 33:22.168
I drafted a statement
last night.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.254
Get it out ASAP and get to work

33:24.295 --> 33:28.216
on as many appearances
as you possibly can.

33:28.258 --> 33:31.720
Uh, local morning shows,
county fairs. You name it.

33:31.761 --> 33:35.181
We play this right,
soon, it'll be Late Night.

33:35.223 --> 33:39.269
And if we're lucky,
SNL will come calling.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.812
Got it?

33:40.854 --> 33:42.439
Good. Let's get to work.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.566
Oh. And, Lucas, pack your bags.

33:44.607 --> 33:46.693
What?

33:46.735 --> 33:47.902
You're gonna be living

33:47.944 --> 33:49.738
on the campaign bus
for the next few months.

33:49.779 --> 33:52.157
I hope you like
cornfields and Big Macs.

33:54.117 --> 33:55.785
Who doesn't?

33:55.827 --> 33:56.745
NATE:
Lucas.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.542
You know that I know, right?

34:02.584 --> 34:03.668
Nate, I am so sorry.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.211
NATE:
That's all right.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.212
Wouldn't be here without you.

34:07.630 --> 34:08.798
And if I can't roll
with the punches,

34:08.840 --> 34:10.133
I shouldn't be running
for president.

34:11.301 --> 34:14.304
But we're building
something here.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.472
Something bigger than ourselves.

34:17.140 --> 34:19.476
So, from here on out,
let's just keep things

34:19.517 --> 34:21.353
close to the chest, okay?

34:21.394 --> 34:22.437
Even in your own house.

34:25.607 --> 34:28.443
Pretend you're in the CIA.
See you on the campaign bus.

34:32.155 --> 34:34.240
[exhales deeply]

34:34.282 --> 34:36.576
[indistinct chatter]

34:47.671 --> 34:49.381
You double-checked
the lotto stats?

34:49.422 --> 34:50.799
Triple-checked.

34:50.840 --> 34:51.800
Let's go.

34:55.261 --> 34:59.516
The CEO of Meyers & Goldstein
hosted two private fundraisers

34:59.557 --> 35:01.601
for Turnbull
at his country house

35:01.643 --> 35:02.644
during the primaries.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.437
It's probably
just a coincidence.

35:04.479 --> 35:07.774
But fishy enough for us
to follow the scent.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.610
Well, there's still something
I can't wrap my head around.

35:10.652 --> 35:12.570
If they really are cooking
the books,

35:12.612 --> 35:14.531
why are they willing to risk
years behind bars?

35:14.572 --> 35:16.950
Government shells out
500 billion a year

35:16.991 --> 35:18.952
in contracts
to the private sector.

35:18.993 --> 35:20.620
Meyers & Goldstein's
bread and butter.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.789
Right. So, what now?

35:22.831 --> 35:24.207
NICK:
Well, we get someone

35:24.249 --> 35:27.961
on the inside to help us
find proof and blow the whistle.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.921
ELI:
How do we do that?

35:29.963 --> 35:31.589
NICK:
That's a good question.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.301
I've got a neighbor
who pushes paper

35:35.343 --> 35:36.594
for Meyers & Goldstein.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.723
Got his kid into kindergarten.

35:39.764 --> 35:40.473
[chuckles]

35:41.016 --> 35:43.601
Fuck, I love this town.

35:44.978 --> 35:48.940
I help this poor guy piss away
30K in glorified daycare,

35:48.982 --> 35:50.900
and he owes me a favor.

35:50.942 --> 35:52.318
So, you'll get him
to fish around?

35:52.360 --> 35:53.653
No, no, no, no.

35:53.695 --> 35:54.696
He wouldn't do that.

35:56.364 --> 35:58.616
He thinks that Turnbull
is Reagan in pearls.

35:58.658 --> 35:59.576
[chuckles softly]

35:59.617 --> 36:01.327
No.

36:01.369 --> 36:04.581
But I have got you an interview
with his associate in PR.

36:04.622 --> 36:08.585
So, go! Go.
Recruit us a double agent.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.337
Ooh. Where are you going?

36:10.378 --> 36:12.505
I've got my own interview.

36:12.547 --> 36:13.673
ELI:
With who?

36:13.715 --> 36:16.301
At worst,
your generation's Ralph Nader.

36:16.343 --> 36:18.511
At best,
the second coming of Christ.

36:18.553 --> 36:22.390
Although something tells me,
he's somewhere in between.

36:22.432 --> 36:31.399

We're a perennial benefactor

36:54.339 --> 36:56.716
of the Boys and Girls Club

36:56.758 --> 36:58.635
we've implemented
a company-wide day of service

36:58.677 --> 37:00.053
with Habitat for Humanity.

37:00.095 --> 37:01.596
Wow.

37:01.638 --> 37:04.724
It must be so rewarding,
giving inner-city kids

37:04.766 --> 37:05.725
safe places to grow.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.268
Hmm. It really is.

37:07.310 --> 37:07.977

37:08.019 --> 37:08.937
Is that your little one?

37:10.063 --> 37:11.606
JENNIFER:
Mm!
[chuckles]

37:11.648 --> 37:12.732
That's my Maya.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.984

She is really beautiful.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.027
Isn't she? [laughs]

37:16.069 --> 37:17.737
Look at those cheeks!

37:17.779 --> 37:19.447
You're so sweet.
Do you have kids?

37:19.489 --> 37:20.490
Maybe one day.

37:20.532 --> 37:22.951
But for now, this is my baby.

37:24.369 --> 37:25.704
So, Ms. Cooke--

37:25.745 --> 37:27.497
Oh, please call me, "Jennifer".

37:28.623 --> 37:30.291
Jennifer.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.752
How do your company's
charitable donations compare

37:32.794 --> 37:34.629
to its political donations?

37:36.506 --> 37:38.383
I knew you'd throw
a hard ball sooner or later.

37:38.425 --> 37:39.467
[chuckles]

37:39.509 --> 37:41.761
But I'm not privy
to that information.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.638
If you'd like to chat
about our sustainability--

37:43.680 --> 37:46.891
What is your opinion
on Senator Patricia Turnbull?

37:46.933 --> 37:48.435
You mean personally?

37:48.476 --> 37:50.311
I, uh... [chuckles nervously]

37:50.353 --> 37:51.604
-What does this have to do--
-Some people think

37:51.646 --> 37:53.314
she would set the country
back 50 years.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.860
Listen. Between you and me,
I think she'd set

37:56.901 --> 37:58.903
the country back 100 years.

37:58.945 --> 38:01.364
But I don't understand
why you wanna talk to me--

38:01.406 --> 38:02.449
ELI:
Meyers & Goldstein

38:02.490 --> 38:04.576
handles the books
for SuperMillions

38:04.617 --> 38:08.580
and for Turnbull's Super PAC,
UpRight.

38:08.621 --> 38:09.622
Isn't that correct?

38:10.832 --> 38:12.917
I'm sorry. I can't discuss--

38:12.959 --> 38:15.128
Who handles those accounts?

38:15.170 --> 38:17.464
-I'm not authorized--
-Does the same executive
cover both?

38:17.505 --> 38:18.840
Okay. I think
I'm gonna have to ask you

38:18.882 --> 38:20.383
-to leave--
-Please. Jennifer.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.593
If you don't tell me
what this is about--

38:21.634 --> 38:23.136
I, too, think Patricia Turnbull

38:23.178 --> 38:26.473
is on the wrong side of
history,
and potentially, the law.

38:27.974 --> 38:29.684
I think
you're gonna wanna see this.

38:33.688 --> 38:37.442
[pants]

38:37.484 --> 38:38.985
Planning for a comeback?

38:39.027 --> 38:41.029
NATE:
Running for president

38:41.071 --> 38:43.448
is more grueling
than decathlon.

38:43.490 --> 38:45.450
[grunts]

38:45.492 --> 38:48.912
I'm surprised
you didn't cancel our interview.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.830
Why? 'Cause your team
did a better job than mine?

38:50.872 --> 38:52.082
Hmm.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.460
My day maybe a bit more hectic
thanks to the Chronicle,

38:55.502 --> 38:57.420
but I always keep
my commitments.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.380
NICK:
All right.

38:59.464 --> 39:00.548
First question.

39:02.384 --> 39:03.551
Why?

39:03.593 --> 39:04.844
Why? [chuckles]

39:04.886 --> 39:06.012
NICK:
Yeah. I mean, you could earn
millions,

39:06.054 --> 39:07.931
slapping your face
on that protein shake,

39:07.972 --> 39:09.849
and spending your time
golfing and fishing.

39:09.891 --> 39:11.184
You know, not a bad life.

39:11.226 --> 39:13.520
So, again, I ask you, why?

39:15.146 --> 39:16.106
Because I suck at golf.

turns delusions of grandeur
into reality.

39:23.697 --> 39:26.533
So, you tell me
why this isn't anything

39:26.574 --> 39:27.784
more than a vanity run?

39:27.826 --> 39:29.536
Look, I think it's only fair

39:29.577 --> 39:30.829
you give me an honest
evaluation
before you diagnose me,

Mr. Booker.

I'm not just coming
from the locker room

39:33.707 --> 39:35.041

Oh, yeah. Law school.

39:38.586 --> 39:38.795
And your foundation's done
a lot of good,

two candidates

39:41.006 --> 39:42.882
with damn near
a century's experience

39:42.924 --> 39:43.925
between them.

39:44.718 --> 39:45.844
How's that worked out for us,
huh?

39:46.761 --> 39:48.430
You checked your
retirement portfolio lately?

39:49.723 --> 39:51.891
destroyed by flash floods

39:51.933 --> 39:54.728
You checked the numbers
on drug overdoses or suicides?

Shit! Life expectancy's gone
down for the first time

39:57.022 --> 39:57.939

40:00.150 --> 40:02.610
People are desperate out there.

Somebody to invest

my work was very real

40:22.297 --> 40:24.466
to tens of thousands
of grieving families.

40:24.507 --> 40:26.676
Well, you surely made
some very powerful enemies.

40:26.718 --> 40:28.470
NATE:
Who? Big drug companies?

40:28.511 --> 40:29.971
They were selling
bold-faced lies.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.932
Claiming oxy wasn't addictive.
Let me ask you a question.

40:32.974 --> 40:34.976
How much do you think the NRA
spend on lobbying every year?

40:35.018 --> 40:36.102
Two, three million?

40:36.144 --> 40:37.312
NATE:
Correct.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.813
What do you think big pharma
spent last year?

40:40.523 --> 40:42.233
300 million.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.611
-They say they got nothing
to hide?
-[Nick chuckles]

40:44.652 --> 40:47.530
And that's why my heart
medicine
costs more than my alimony.

40:47.572 --> 40:49.199
-[Nate chuckles]
-We're gonna do something
about that, too.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.241
Oh, my ex-wife?

40:50.283 --> 40:51.159
Please, please do.

40:51.201 --> 40:52.827
[chuckles]

40:56.915 --> 40:59.125
Look me in the eye.

40:59.167 --> 41:00.919
And tell me why you think
you can win.

41:02.837 --> 41:04.631
'Cause I'll tell you
what Vegas thinks.

41:05.799 --> 41:07.801
You don't stand a chance.
Then what?

41:07.842 --> 41:10.053
You peel off enough votes
from the president

41:10.095 --> 41:13.515
to hand Turnbull the election
on a silver platter.

41:14.933 --> 41:15.934
I don't play for silver.

41:20.188 --> 41:21.731
ELI:
If you are able

41:21.773 --> 41:23.817
to get me any information
at all,

41:23.858 --> 41:26.111
emails, financials,
expense reports, don't--

41:26.152 --> 41:28.571
Okay, listen. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

41:28.613 --> 41:29.739
There has to be another way
for you

41:29.781 --> 41:30.699
to get
the information you need.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.991
And what if I can't?

41:32.033 --> 41:33.284
Then what?

41:33.326 --> 41:35.245
Do we just let them get away
with it?

41:35.286 --> 41:36.996
Your bosses could be committing
a crime

41:37.038 --> 41:38.998
that has devastating
ripple effects,

41:39.040 --> 41:42.085
and it would be a crime
with no consequence,

41:42.127 --> 41:44.045
no punishment,
no accountability.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.340
But that's just the way
the world works I guess. Right?

41:47.382 --> 41:48.925
Nothing we can do about it.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.177
Pardon me, but fuck that.

41:51.219 --> 41:52.721
This time, we can.

41:54.222 --> 41:56.599
I'm sorry.

41:56.641 --> 41:57.851
I have my daughter
to think about.

42:02.647 --> 42:03.606
Of course.

42:15.744 --> 42:18.997
I hear there's a real bad cold
going around.

42:19.039 --> 42:21.082
If you have to cough, it's
okay.
I'll understand.

Okay, I'll talk to Dean,

Relax, Nick.

This came down from above.

Look, we're bleeding cash.

And the investigative team
is among

44:29.044 --> 44:30.712

44:30.754 --> 44:33.006
First, they came
for the journalists.

44:33.048 --> 44:34.466
We don't know what happened
after that.

Don't be so goddamn dramatic.

Well, you're the one

I suggest you keep
your head down,

44:49.105 --> 44:50.523
and let me worry about it.

44:50.565 --> 44:52.067
This is so weak, Gordon.

44:53.860 --> 44:55.028
I always knew you were a prick,

44:55.070 --> 44:56.863
but I never thought
you were a pushover.

44:56.905 --> 44:59.449
We need to hold
our best reporters tight.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.911
If there's no one to defend
the truth,

45:02.952 --> 45:05.205
then we live

45:13.338 --> 45:15.048
You've never asked that before.

Who's your source?

47:56.668 --> 47:58.420
That's confidential.

Is it the PR associate?

What's your angle?

48:06.219 --> 48:07.012
You want top byline?

No. I just-- I don't think--

48:08.972 --> 48:11.433
Who is the goddamn
whistleblower?

48:16.271 --> 48:17.230
You stole it?

I hit a dead-end.

48:28.533 --> 48:30.243

48:30.285 --> 48:32.245
Something this big,

LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Hey, babe.

54:50.957 --> 54:50.999
My plane's about to take off.
What's up?

54:54.502 --> 54:55.670
Eli, can-- can you hear me?

54:57.505 --> 54:58.965
[stewardess speaking
indistinctly]

54:59.007 --> 54:59.883
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Oh, shit.

55:01.468 --> 55:03.970
Eli? Is everything all right?

55:04.012 --> 55:04.971
It's my dad.

55:06.514 --> 55:08.350
He's sick.

55:08.391 --> 55:10.643
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Sick? How sick?

55:11.353 --> 55:12.062
STEWARDESS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Sir.

55:13.146 --> 55:13.646
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Oh, shit.

55:15.106 --> 55:15.148
Listen. I'm gonna catch
the first flight back, okay?

55:15.815 --> 55:15.857
No! No, no, no, no.

55:17.233 --> 55:19.736
We're taking care of it.
You're where you need to be.

55:21.029 --> 55:21.905
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Okay.

55:23.114 --> 55:24.032
I love you.

55:25.492 --> 55:27.118
I love you, too, babe.

55:28.870 --> 55:28.912
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Eli, I'm gonna lose you
until we land.

55:30.121 --> 55:30.163
I'm calling you back
as soon as I can.

55:30.538 --> 55:33.792
[sobs]

55:33.833 --> 55:42.759
(***)

55:58.149 --> 55:59.776
Who's your source?

55:59.818 --> 56:01.444
Jennifer Cooke in PR.

56:03.154 --> 56:04.406
Let's get to work.

56:04.447 --> 56:08.410
(***)

56:12.706 --> 56:15.834
CORRESPONDENT 9 (ON TV):
As summer fades to fall,
the race has never been tighter.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.002
CORRESPONDENT 10 (ON TV):
I mean, the man's trying

56:18.336 --> 56:19.421
to do something
that's never been done before.

56:20.839 --> 56:20.964
And I'm just not convinced
that he can pull it off.

56:22.132 --> 56:22.173
CORRESPONDENT 11 (ON TV):
Whoa! Hold on.

56:23.383 --> 56:24.592
He sold out the big house
in Michigan.

56:25.593 --> 56:28.138
That's a 110,000
for a political rally.

56:28.179 --> 56:29.889
I've never seen anything
like it.

56:29.931 --> 56:31.599
CORRESPONDENT 12 (ON TV):
Okay. I mean, it is impressive.

56:31.641 --> 56:33.143
But it's not like
Senator Turnbull's just

56:33.184 --> 56:34.102
gonna roll over.

56:35.186 --> 56:36.438
She's had the lead
since day one.

56:37.522 --> 56:37.605
REPORTER (ON TV):
Who do you plan to vote for?

56:38.690 --> 56:39.482
YOUNG VOTER (ON TV):
Nate Sterling.

56:41.192 --> 56:41.651
REPORTER (ON TV):
Do you usually vote Democrat
or Republican?

56:42.902 --> 56:42.944
YOUNG VOTER (ON TV):
I've never voted before.

56:44.029 --> 56:44.070
And this is my first time
voting.

56:44.612 --> 56:47.991
(***)

56:50.160 --> 56:51.786
[sighs]

57:20.815 --> 57:21.983
Nick.

57:22.025 --> 57:22.984
Huh?

57:24.152 --> 57:24.944
ELI:
Does it make any sense

57:25.862 --> 57:26.988
for the director
of SuperMillions

57:28.239 --> 57:29.532
to send an expense report
for a holiday party

57:29.574 --> 57:32.535
to a partner
at Meyers & Goldstein?

57:32.577 --> 57:34.537
No.

57:34.579 --> 57:37.499
An assistant would perform
those menial tasks. Why?

57:55.183 --> 57:56.685
I think these invoices
are fakes.

57:58.728 --> 58:01.231
They each contain
a four, an eight, or both.

58:01.272 --> 58:02.023
That's the tell.

58:02.565 --> 58:03.983
Well, it's human nature

58:04.025 --> 58:05.985
to prefer some numbers
over others.

58:06.027 --> 58:08.697
This is how companies spot
expense-account fraud.

58:08.738 --> 58:11.741
I mean, I'm willing to bet
that the Memorial Day retreat

58:11.783 --> 58:12.701
didn't even happen.

58:12.742 --> 58:13.868
NICK:
Well, any real invoices

58:13.910 --> 58:15.161
from Patriot Catering

58:15.203 --> 58:17.789
sure didn't pass
through these execs.

58:21.251 --> 58:25.213
ELI:
174684.

58:28.216 --> 58:37.142
(***)

58:40.895 --> 58:44.858
The average SuperMillions
jackpot is $20 million.

58:44.899 --> 58:48.028
In recessions, jackpots
increase by approximately

58:48.069 --> 58:49.863
eight percent.

58:49.904 --> 58:52.073
So, that means
that the average jackpot

58:52.115 --> 58:54.117
-should be...
-21.6 million.

58:55.368 --> 58:58.163
Correct. 21.6 million.

58:58.204 --> 59:02.709
But it's holding steady
at 19 million.

59:02.751 --> 59:05.712
Well, that's a gap
of 2.6 million per drawing.

59:09.674 --> 59:12.093
ELI:
Right. The first
Patriot trading invoice

59:12.135 --> 59:16.056
goes back to 34 weeks ago.

59:17.724 --> 59:19.392
Two drawings a week. That's...

59:19.434 --> 59:20.352
ELI:
That is...

59:23.355 --> 59:24.314
God.

59:27.609 --> 59:30.362
-Pretty damn close to bulls-eye.
-Holy fuck.

59:31.696 --> 59:34.949
For every $1,000 embezzled

59:34.991 --> 59:36.076
from the SuperMillions lottery

59:37.285 --> 59:38.370
and transferred to UpRight,
the invoice...

59:38.411 --> 59:40.038
Show a buck.

59:40.080 --> 59:40.955
Yeah.

59:40.997 --> 59:42.916
That's their fucking code.

59:44.793 --> 59:45.335
[sighs]

59:45.377 --> 59:46.419
ELI:
Erickson.

59:46.461 --> 59:49.756
Erickson fudges the books, okay?

59:49.798 --> 59:52.717
The money moves
in the dark of night.

59:52.759 --> 59:56.971
The-- the-- the-- the invoices
track the spoils,

59:57.013 --> 1:00:00.266
letting them communicate
without having to type fraud

1:00:00.308 --> 1:00:01.685
in the subject line.

1:00:01.726 --> 1:00:02.769
[Nick chuckles]

1:00:02.811 --> 1:00:04.229
A barn full of haystacks.

1:00:05.730 --> 1:00:08.358
And you found
the fucking needle.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:09.693
[chuckles softly]

1:00:09.734 --> 1:00:10.276
[indistinct chatter]

1:00:11.069 --> 1:00:11.152
COLLEGE KID:
Thank you.

1:00:11.695 --> 1:00:20.161
(***)

1:00:23.832 --> 1:00:26.292
Hey, can I bum a cigarette?

1:00:26.334 --> 1:00:27.293
COLLEGE KID:
Oh, yeah.

1:00:30.338 --> 1:00:31.297
ELI:
Thanks.

1:00:31.339 --> 1:00:33.091
Oh, so, you're the caterer.

1:00:33.133 --> 1:00:34.801
-COLLEGE KID: Yeah.
-Excellent job inside.

1:00:34.843 --> 1:00:36.720
Those deviled eggs
look delicious.

1:00:36.761 --> 1:00:37.846
COLLEGE KID:
Thanks.

1:00:38.722 --> 1:00:38.805
I wish I could tell you
that I made them,

1:00:39.931 --> 1:00:41.016
but I just load 'em in
and hand 'em out.

1:00:41.057 --> 1:00:42.475
[exhales]

1:00:42.517 --> 1:00:44.728
"Patriot Catering." [chuckles]

1:00:44.769 --> 1:00:46.855
-COLLEGE KID: That's us.
-Haven't seen you guys before.

1:00:46.896 --> 1:00:47.939
Have you been in business
for a long time?

1:00:47.981 --> 1:00:50.150
Uh, coming up to a year.

1:00:50.191 --> 1:00:52.193
-ELI: Wow. Really new.
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:52.235 --> 1:00:53.987
-ELI: Family-owned?
-Nope.

1:00:54.029 --> 1:00:55.905
This dude named Dean owns it.

1:00:55.947 --> 1:00:57.991
Wait. Not Dean Bender.

1:00:58.033 --> 1:01:00.744
No. Dean Clifton.

1:01:00.785 --> 1:01:03.079
Oh, gotcha. Clifton.

1:01:03.121 --> 1:01:04.247
Yeah.

1:01:04.289 --> 1:01:06.082
So, you got a lot of events
coming up?

1:01:06.124 --> 1:01:08.752
-Rubbing elbows with D.C.
big wigs?
-[college kid chuckles]

1:01:08.793 --> 1:01:10.170
COLLEGE KID:
We got some big ones coming up.

1:01:11.713 --> 1:01:12.964
But honestly, they're, like,
all the same to me, you know?

1:01:13.006 --> 1:01:15.884
Same bacon-wrapped scallops.
Same penguin suit.

1:01:15.925 --> 1:01:17.802
Same rich folks
boring up the place.

1:01:17.844 --> 1:01:20.513
[chuckles]

1:01:20.555 --> 1:01:22.098
You got a card?

1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:23.850
COLLEGE KID:
Oh, yeah.

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:26.853
Just you know, somewhere here.

1:01:26.895 --> 1:01:29.064
Here.
Uh, the menu's in that link.

1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:32.776
So, if you ever throw a bash,
you know, we're around.

1:01:33.526 --> 1:01:35.070
Cool. Thanks.

1:01:35.111 --> 1:01:36.279
-Yeah.
-And thanks.

1:01:36.321 --> 1:01:38.239
-Yeah. Have a good one.
-You, too.

1:01:42.327 --> 1:01:43.953
MODERATOR:
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.

1:01:43.995 --> 1:01:46.122
We need to move on,
and I wanna give

1:01:46.164 --> 1:01:49.417
Mr. Sterling a chance to
respond
before closing statements.

1:01:49.459 --> 1:01:51.002
Let's face it.

1:01:51.044 --> 1:01:52.879
Washington's got one foot
so far left

1:01:52.921 --> 1:01:56.216
and the other so far right,
that it can't stand up straight.

1:01:56.257 --> 1:01:58.468
Congress is doing a split
in the quicksand,

1:01:58.510 --> 1:01:59.969
and I'm the only guy
that can pull us out

1:02:00.011 --> 1:02:01.137
of this partisan quagmire.

1:02:01.179 --> 1:02:04.057
Why?
Because I'm free.

1:02:04.099 --> 1:02:06.935
Free of special interests.
Free of party-power brokers.

1:02:06.976 --> 1:02:09.396
And I'm free to explore
the best ideas

1:02:09.437 --> 1:02:11.147
from both sides of the aisle.

1:02:11.189 --> 1:02:13.024
Because I don't sit
on either one.

1:02:13.066 --> 1:02:14.109
I stand proudly in the middle.

1:02:17.070 --> 1:02:18.238
Credentials to the debate?

1:02:20.949 --> 1:02:21.866
TURNBULL (ON TV):
Sure.

1:02:23.118 --> 1:02:24.953
What's it being Booker's
lapdog,
eh?

1:02:26.955 --> 1:02:28.415
[barks]

1:02:28.456 --> 1:02:30.041
TURNBULL:
But what you don't seem
to understand, sir,

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:31.835
we're talking about decisions

1:02:31.876 --> 1:02:34.004
that can mean the difference
between life and death.

1:02:34.045 --> 1:02:35.922
-The wisdom...
-Tell me the truth, though.

1:02:35.964 --> 1:02:39.175
Has, um...
has the old man lost a step?

1:02:41.052 --> 1:02:42.971
You know, just putting
so much time

1:02:43.013 --> 1:02:45.515
into a cub with a rap sheet.

1:02:47.183 --> 1:02:49.561
If I were you, I would just
keep
asking myself why?

1:02:50.937 --> 1:02:53.106
I'm trying to watch the debate.

1:02:53.148 --> 1:02:55.275
Take it easy, Patricia.

1:02:55.316 --> 1:02:57.444
Mr. Sterling represented
our country proudly.

1:02:57.485 --> 1:02:58.862
TURNBULL:
Oh, oh, oh.

1:02:58.903 --> 1:03:00.572
I beg your pardon,
Mr. President.

1:03:00.613 --> 1:03:03.074
The only reason you're giving
his lack of experience

1:03:03.116 --> 1:03:05.910
a hall pass is because you see
in the polls

1:03:05.952 --> 1:03:08.872
that he's gonna steal more
votes
from me than he is from you

1:03:08.913 --> 1:03:10.874
in key battleground states.

1:03:10.915 --> 1:03:14.836
But this election
is about so much more

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:15.837
than politics.

1:03:17.088 --> 1:03:19.299
And I'm not even talking
about what it'll mean

1:03:19.341 --> 1:03:23.178
to millions of little girls
to see a woman take

1:03:23.219 --> 1:03:25.930
the oath of office
for the very first time

1:03:25.972 --> 1:03:27.223
in this country.

1:03:27.265 --> 1:03:30.018
That's significant. Oh!

1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:31.978
Yes, it is.

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:34.397
But let's leave that discussion
to the history books,

1:03:34.439 --> 1:03:36.024
'cause what I wanna talk
about right now

1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:39.277
is what my administration
is gonna do

1:03:39.319 --> 1:03:42.530
to make your lives better.
Plain simple.

1:03:42.572 --> 1:03:45.033
Like fixing that pothole
on your street.

1:03:45.075 --> 1:03:48.328
Getting your 401K moving up
and to the right again.

1:03:48.370 --> 1:03:50.663
Keeping you
and your children safe

1:03:50.705 --> 1:03:52.624
from enemies,
foreign and domestic.

1:03:52.665 --> 1:03:55.377
Pulling us out of this
recession
once and for all.

1:03:56.503 --> 1:04:00.006
And most importantly,
shining a light

1:04:00.048 --> 1:04:03.009
on the working people
of this country

1:04:03.051 --> 1:04:05.595
who have been invisible
for far too long.

1:04:07.097 --> 1:04:09.057
That's what
I'm gonna talk about.

1:04:09.099 --> 1:04:10.892
[crowd cheering, whistling]

1:04:10.934 --> 1:04:11.893
Thank you.

1:04:13.144 --> 1:04:14.562
What will it mean

1:04:14.604 --> 1:04:17.232
for millions of little girls
to see a female president?

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:20.402
Far more than I could ever
comprehend.

1:04:21.986 --> 1:04:24.364
But what's it gonna mean
for our environment,

1:04:24.406 --> 1:04:28.284
for our teachers,
for our poor and middle class

1:04:28.326 --> 1:04:30.286
to see you as president,
Senator Turnbull?

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:34.332
We are long overdue for a woman
in the White House.

1:04:34.374 --> 1:04:36.459
But it can't just be any woman.

1:04:36.501 --> 1:04:38.420
It's gotta be the right woman.

1:04:38.461 --> 1:04:39.963
Not a woman that denied
climate change

1:04:40.005 --> 1:04:41.256
is real till just last year.

1:04:43.925 --> 1:04:45.510
And that is precisely
why my cabinet

1:04:45.552 --> 1:04:47.012
will be made up
of 50 percent women

1:04:47.053 --> 1:04:47.971
at the very minimal.

1:04:48.013 --> 1:04:50.140
[crowd cheering]

1:04:53.018 --> 1:04:55.061
[indistinct chatter]

1:04:55.103 --> 1:04:57.022
-You look nice.
-LUCAS: Thanks.

1:04:57.063 --> 1:04:58.940
I can't believe we're actually
in the same state.

1:04:58.982 --> 1:05:00.358
I kinda like it.

1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.193
Think you might wanna ditch
your credentials.

1:05:02.235 --> 1:05:04.404
You'll scare the personality
out of everyone.

1:05:04.446 --> 1:05:06.197
Hey, Nate.

1:05:06.239 --> 1:05:07.449
-Awesome job.
-[Nate chuckles]

1:05:07.490 --> 1:05:09.242
Thank you.
What are the mosquitos sayin'?

1:05:09.284 --> 1:05:11.327
Well, most of the pundits
are calling it for you,

1:05:11.369 --> 1:05:13.246
and Twitter's looking
pretty bullish.

1:05:13.288 --> 1:05:15.081
You remember my girlfriend,
Eli.

1:05:15.123 --> 1:05:16.499
[chuckles]
That I do.

1:05:18.168 --> 1:05:20.003
I hear you're making big waves
over at the Chronicle.

1:05:20.045 --> 1:05:21.129
[chuckles]

1:05:21.171 --> 1:05:23.340
Splashing about
in the shallow end,

1:05:23.381 --> 1:05:25.050
but I'm trying.

1:05:25.091 --> 1:05:25.967
NATE:
I'm sure you had to disclose

1:05:27.052 --> 1:05:27.385
that you're dating
this handsome guy.

1:05:27.427 --> 1:05:28.720
I did.

1:05:28.762 --> 1:05:30.638
But it helps that I'm not
covering your campaign.

1:05:31.973 --> 1:05:32.932
NATE:
Of course.

1:05:32.974 --> 1:05:33.683
What did you think
of the debate?

1:05:35.143 --> 1:05:36.144
Honestly?

1:05:37.437 --> 1:05:38.772
I'd be surprised
if you didn't poach

1:05:38.813 --> 1:05:40.398
a point or two
from both parties.

1:05:42.359 --> 1:05:43.401
-She's a keeper.
-LUCAS: Hmm.

1:05:43.443 --> 1:05:44.986
And you, miss,

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.488
you are lucky to have a guy
like this by your side.

1:05:47.322 --> 1:05:48.615
As are you.

1:05:50.075 --> 1:05:50.408
Speaking of which, Lucas,
can I steal you for a second?

1:05:51.451 --> 1:05:51.493
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

1:05:51.951 --> 1:05:52.494
Thank you.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:05:58.500
LUCAS:
Hey.

1:05:59.167 --> 1:06:00.710
[indistinct chatter]

1:06:04.673 --> 1:06:05.715
COLLEGE KID:
May I take these?

1:06:07.509 --> 1:06:09.511
Hey. Patriot Catering?

1:06:09.552 --> 1:06:11.388
[chuckles] I'll be damned.

1:06:11.429 --> 1:06:12.597
-[Eli chuckles]
-How goes it?

1:06:12.639 --> 1:06:14.140
[Eli gasps]

1:06:14.182 --> 1:06:15.642
-Wait. This is the big event?
-COLLEGE KID: Yeah.

1:06:15.684 --> 1:06:18.311
The most exciting night
of your life, right?

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:19.521
So boring.

1:06:19.562 --> 1:06:21.648
You might just be serving
the next president

1:06:21.690 --> 1:06:23.149
of the United States of America.

1:06:23.775 --> 1:06:25.360
That dude?

1:06:25.402 --> 1:06:27.028
We've been catering for him
since before he entered

1:06:27.070 --> 1:06:27.737
the race.

1:06:27.779 --> 1:06:29.030
The lustre's worn off.

1:06:30.031 --> 1:06:31.074
Plus, the boss doesn't want me
to spread around.

1:06:32.742 --> 1:06:34.494
Makes sense.

1:06:34.536 --> 1:06:36.705
I mean, you probably do
business
with the Republicans, too.

1:06:36.746 --> 1:06:38.164
No, just Sterling.

1:06:38.206 --> 1:06:39.374
Dean's loyal like that.

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:41.418
I should probably get back
to work.

1:06:41.459 --> 1:06:43.503
He likes us to move around.

1:06:43.545 --> 1:06:45.463
-Dean is here?
-Yeah.

1:06:45.505 --> 1:06:48.508
Talking to Sterling
and Jack Hampton.

1:06:48.550 --> 1:06:50.719
He's looking over here.
I better keep moving.

1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:55.390
I'll see you at the next one.

1:06:57.809 --> 1:07:00.687
-MAYFIELD: Hey! Gentlemen!
-NATE: Hey! How are you, sir?

1:07:02.439 --> 1:07:03.356
-Tom Mayfield.
-LUCAS: I'm Lucas.

1:07:03.398 --> 1:07:04.274
Nice to meet you.

1:07:04.315 --> 1:07:08.236
(***)

1:07:12.198 --> 1:07:13.575
LUCAS:
Hey.

1:07:13.616 --> 1:07:16.453
That was the owner
of your paper.

1:07:16.494 --> 1:07:18.329
Don't worry.
I didn't embarrass you.

1:07:18.371 --> 1:07:19.330
Who else is there?

1:07:20.582 --> 1:07:21.583
Bunch of big donors.

1:07:22.792 --> 1:07:24.252
The guy on the right
owns a slew

1:07:24.294 --> 1:07:25.754
of catering companies.

1:07:25.795 --> 1:07:29.299
Nate says that he is
a culinary mastermind.

1:07:29.341 --> 1:07:30.550
What's his name?

1:07:30.592 --> 1:07:32.302
Uh, Dean something.

1:07:32.344 --> 1:07:33.428
Everyone calls him "The Chef."

1:07:34.804 --> 1:07:36.806
-I gotta go.
-Hey. What? We just got here.

1:07:36.848 --> 1:07:38.683
Lucas, I gotta go.

1:07:38.725 --> 1:07:40.268
I haven't seen you in weeks
and you're leaving?

1:07:40.310 --> 1:07:41.311
Eli!

1:07:41.353 --> 1:07:50.320
(***)

1:07:59.371 --> 1:08:08.338
(***)

1:08:18.765 --> 1:08:19.766
How was it?

1:08:19.808 --> 1:08:21.601
ELI:
Nick, we need to talk.

1:08:21.643 --> 1:08:24.270
Turnbull isn't embezzling money
from SuperMillions.

1:08:24.312 --> 1:08:25.313
Sterling is.

1:08:27.148 --> 1:08:28.233
You think that's funny?

1:08:28.274 --> 1:08:29.317
ELI:
No, I'm serious.

1:08:30.819 --> 1:08:33.780
Patriot Catering worked
his debate afterparty.

1:08:33.822 --> 1:08:36.366
They have catered
all of Sterling's events

1:08:36.408 --> 1:08:38.618
since before he entered
the race.

1:08:38.660 --> 1:08:40.870
It was right in front
of our faces the whole time.

1:08:40.912 --> 1:08:42.580
Meyers & Goldstein,
they handled the books

1:08:42.622 --> 1:08:43.957
for Sterling's Super PAC
as well.

1:08:43.998 --> 1:08:46.292
Sterling reject
the Super PAC on principle.

1:08:46.334 --> 1:08:47.669
ELI:
In the first month
of his campaign,

1:08:47.711 --> 1:08:48.628
he made a big show of it.

1:08:48.670 --> 1:08:49.879
But that did not last long.

1:08:53.174 --> 1:08:54.968
NICK:
Integrity Super PAC?
[scoffs]

1:08:55.010 --> 1:08:56.594
That's an oxymoron.

1:08:57.846 --> 1:08:58.638
Yeah. He named it something
generic to keep a low profile--

1:09:00.098 --> 1:09:01.224
Yeah. Still, still, still,
this isn't definitive proof

1:09:01.266 --> 1:09:03.518
that he--
Why would he be that bold?

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:06.312
Juice isn't worth the squeeze.
He's up three points.

1:09:06.354 --> 1:09:07.564
He is now.

1:09:07.605 --> 1:09:08.815
But this time last year,
his name

1:09:08.857 --> 1:09:10.191
wasn't on a single poll.

1:09:11.526 --> 1:09:13.236
What's the only way to win
the New York City Marathon

1:09:13.278 --> 1:09:14.195
without any training?

1:09:15.321 --> 1:09:17.574
Take the subway,
sneak under the rope

1:09:17.615 --> 1:09:18.950
-on mile 18.
-On mile 18.

1:09:21.494 --> 1:09:24.581
But Mayfield,
that bow-tied prick.

1:09:24.622 --> 1:09:27.250
I mean, he's a Republican.
It doesn't make any sense.

1:09:27.292 --> 1:09:28.501
I thought the same thing.

1:09:28.543 --> 1:09:30.754
So, I checked out
his voting records.

1:09:30.795 --> 1:09:33.381
And it turns out,
he left the Republican Party

1:09:33.423 --> 1:09:36.009
right after Reagan rode off
into the sunset.

1:09:36.051 --> 1:09:38.720
The man has been an independent
for the last three decades.

1:09:38.762 --> 1:09:41.514
And then he reregistered
as a Republican the same month

1:09:41.556 --> 1:09:43.516
that Sterling's book
hit the best-seller list.

1:09:43.558 --> 1:09:45.643
It was all calculated.

1:09:45.685 --> 1:09:46.895
He must have thought
if people like us picked up

1:09:48.229 --> 1:09:48.605
a scent, it would throw us
off the trail, and...

1:09:49.939 --> 1:09:50.899
it worked.

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:53.985
What the fuck do we do now?

1:09:57.405 --> 1:09:58.948
Follow the facts
wherever they lead.

1:10:00.283 --> 1:10:01.534
Sometimes,
it's not where you wanna go,

1:10:01.576 --> 1:10:02.827
but you go anyway.

1:10:06.915 --> 1:10:08.291
[sighs]

1:10:08.333 --> 1:10:09.834
CORRESPONDENT 13 (ON TV):
With just one week to go,

1:10:11.086 --> 1:10:12.545
Nate Sterling has pulled ahead
of Senator Turnbull

1:10:13.588 --> 1:10:15.256
for the first time
in national polling.

1:10:16.591 --> 1:10:17.884
While the lead is still
within the margin of error...

1:10:17.926 --> 1:10:19.969
Sterling is our megaphone,

1:10:20.011 --> 1:10:22.889
our voice of reason,
our moral compass,

1:10:22.931 --> 1:10:24.599
and our hope
for a better tomorrow.

1:10:31.314 --> 1:10:32.273
Shit, Eli.

1:10:33.650 --> 1:10:34.651
Where did you run off to?

1:10:37.779 --> 1:10:38.780
What's wrong?

1:10:42.283 --> 1:10:43.034
You see your dad?

1:10:45.286 --> 1:10:47.455
-You're gonna have to scrap
that speech.
-Why? The town hall's tomorrow--

1:10:47.497 --> 1:10:48.707
Because you're not a liar.

1:10:48.748 --> 1:10:50.458
What are you talking about?

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:52.752
-He's funding his campaign
with stolen money.
-What? Who?

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:54.337
Sterling.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.297
-What are you saying?
-I have hard evidence.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:59.718
He's embezzling money
from the lottery,

1:10:59.759 --> 1:11:00.927
and funneling
it to his Super PAC.

1:11:00.969 --> 1:11:02.679
What? That's crazy.

1:11:02.721 --> 1:11:03.972
It's the truth.

1:11:04.014 --> 1:11:05.056
Nick and I have been working
this story--

1:11:05.098 --> 1:11:07.684
No. Why are you telling me this?

1:11:07.726 --> 1:11:09.019
I guess I thought

1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:10.061
you might like to know
that your hero is a fraud.

1:11:10.103 --> 1:11:11.730
Hey. Stop!

1:11:11.771 --> 1:11:13.732
ELI:
And because I need your help.

1:11:13.773 --> 1:11:15.775
Are you--
are you listening to yourself?

1:11:15.817 --> 1:11:18.653
I need someone on the inside
to prove he signed off on it.

1:11:20.488 --> 1:11:21.865
Here.

1:11:21.906 --> 1:11:23.658
I need you to fill this
with Sterling's hard drive.

1:11:23.700 --> 1:11:25.368
-We don't have much time.
-LUCAS: You're delusional.

1:11:25.410 --> 1:11:26.494
ELI:
Goddammit, Lucas!

1:11:26.536 --> 1:11:28.038
You're in denial.

1:11:28.079 --> 1:11:29.831
LUCAS:
No. You can't fucking
help yourself, can you?

1:11:29.873 --> 1:11:31.791
Only this time,
when you blow yourself up,

1:11:31.833 --> 1:11:33.626
you could take me
and the whole goddamn country

1:11:33.668 --> 1:11:34.794
-down with you.
-No. This is different.

1:11:34.836 --> 1:11:35.837
This is real.

1:11:37.005 --> 1:11:38.840
Okay. Let's say that it is real.

1:11:40.967 --> 1:11:42.635
You go from reporting
back-page news

1:11:42.677 --> 1:11:44.346
to being front-page news.

1:11:45.430 --> 1:11:46.931
I get what?

1:11:46.973 --> 1:11:49.768
A seat on the witness stand
in the trial of the century

1:11:49.809 --> 1:11:51.019
when the only thing
I have witnessed

1:11:51.061 --> 1:11:53.355
is a good man
trying to save his country.

1:11:54.731 --> 1:11:56.483
We get hate mails
from our friends,

1:11:56.524 --> 1:11:57.484
the people we respect.

1:11:57.525 --> 1:11:58.651
And then what?

1:11:59.569 --> 1:12:01.571
Gun-toting, gay-bashing,
autocratic zealots,

1:12:01.613 --> 1:12:04.074
they declare us heroes,
and the navel-gazing,

1:12:04.115 --> 1:12:05.992
holier-than-thou woke mob,
they throw us

1:12:06.034 --> 1:12:06.910
a fucking parade,

1:12:07.952 --> 1:12:08.578
congratulations
to the both of us?

1:12:09.829 --> 1:12:10.080
ELI:
Lucas, please calm down.
And just think--

1:12:10.622 --> 1:12:11.498
No, you think!

1:12:15.543 --> 1:12:18.672
Are you willing to keep Penny
at war for the next ten years?

1:12:18.713 --> 1:12:21.966
No. Are you willing to sit
on your hands

1:12:22.008 --> 1:12:24.386
while the fucking Earth fries,
because I'm not.

1:12:24.427 --> 1:12:26.680
The money that he is stealing

1:12:26.721 --> 1:12:28.056
is coming from schools,
like that one in--

1:12:28.098 --> 1:12:29.808
that one in West Virginia.

1:12:29.849 --> 1:12:31.935
Okay? Those kids,
Black and brown kids

1:12:31.976 --> 1:12:33.019
are losing access to a fair
and equal education.

1:12:33.061 --> 1:12:35.021
Eli, it is so much bigger than--

1:12:35.063 --> 1:12:37.107
Don't you fucking finish
that thought!

1:12:39.401 --> 1:12:40.151
Why doesn't this matter to you?

1:12:40.193 --> 1:12:41.903
They matter!

1:12:41.945 --> 1:12:43.196
Everyone else in this country
can act like they don't exist--

1:12:43.238 --> 1:12:45.156
LUCAS:
He is what this country needs!

1:12:45.198 --> 1:12:47.575
A liar is the last thing
this country needs!

1:12:48.743 --> 1:12:50.120
Liars are what fucked
this country up

1:12:50.161 --> 1:12:51.162
in the first place.

1:12:52.914 --> 1:12:55.709
Iraq has stockpiles of WMDs.

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.585
The housing market
will continue to rise.

1:12:57.627 --> 1:12:59.754
The election was rigged.
Redlining.

1:13:01.172 --> 1:13:03.174
The war on drugs,
voter suppression!

1:13:04.843 --> 1:13:08.138
Everywhere you look, lobbyists,
pundits, bankers, preachers,

1:13:08.179 --> 1:13:11.433
billion-dollar industries
that run on lies.

1:13:11.474 --> 1:13:12.809
LUCAS:
What is it that you want, Eli?

1:13:12.851 --> 1:13:14.894
-I want-- I want the truth.
-LUCAS: Yeah.

1:13:14.936 --> 1:13:16.521
Well, you've been duped before,
so.

1:13:17.939 --> 1:13:18.982
[sighs]

1:13:23.236 --> 1:13:24.904
Did you know, Lucas?

1:13:28.158 --> 1:13:29.701
I can't believe
you would even think that.

1:13:31.661 --> 1:13:32.996
[exhales shakily]

1:13:35.123 --> 1:13:37.876
I'm publishing this story
with or without your help.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:42.839
You publish this story,

1:13:43.965 --> 1:13:44.591
I don't want anything
to do with you.

1:13:45.884 --> 1:13:46.134
-That is not fair.
-What do you want me to say?

1:13:47.635 --> 1:13:48.678
Love fades, values don't.

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:57.645
(***)

1:13:59.647 --> 1:14:01.191
That's my fucking jacket!

1:14:01.232 --> 1:14:05.153
(***)

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:07.489
LUCAS:
Nice.

1:14:07.530 --> 1:14:11.493
(***)

1:14:13.912 --> 1:14:14.913
[sighs]

1:14:14.954 --> 1:14:23.880
(***)

1:14:31.638 --> 1:14:32.597
Meet me at Recessions.

1:14:34.057 --> 1:14:35.850
Two blocks northwest
of Farragut Square.

1:14:37.227 --> 1:14:38.186
I have something.

1:14:39.312 --> 1:14:40.814
[indistinct chatter]

1:14:44.859 --> 1:14:46.653
We prove that Sterling knew.

1:14:46.695 --> 1:14:47.821
-NICK: Eli.
-ELI: I'm going tonight.

1:14:47.862 --> 1:14:49.656
Well, Jesus Christ, Eli.

1:14:49.698 --> 1:14:51.074
You're being irrational.

1:14:51.116 --> 1:14:52.742
There's a right way
and a wrong way.

1:14:52.784 --> 1:14:54.577
If you want the ribeye,
you go get the ribeye.

1:14:54.619 --> 1:14:55.995
Not if it's contaminated.

1:14:56.037 --> 1:14:57.956
That ends a career
before it starts.

1:14:57.997 --> 1:14:59.708
Well, already lost
my relationship.

1:14:59.749 --> 1:15:01.001
I'm losing my dad.

1:15:01.042 --> 1:15:02.836
So, why not throw in a career
for good measure?

1:15:02.877 --> 1:15:04.212
You're losing your mind
is what you're losing.

1:15:05.255 --> 1:15:06.214
Wait.

1:15:07.257 --> 1:15:08.216
Relationship?

1:15:09.926 --> 1:15:10.885
Lucas refuses to--

1:15:10.927 --> 1:15:12.846
Oh, fuck, Eli!

1:15:12.887 --> 1:15:14.097
You told him?

1:15:14.139 --> 1:15:15.390
[sighs]

1:15:15.432 --> 1:15:18.143
They'll have the place
power-cleaned in an hour.

1:15:18.184 --> 1:15:20.645
Shit! Shit!

1:15:20.687 --> 1:15:21.646
You're right.

1:15:21.688 --> 1:15:25.650
(***)

1:15:28.653 --> 1:15:29.863
Eli! Shit!

1:15:31.656 --> 1:15:32.615
Fuck.

1:15:33.742 --> 1:15:34.284
Hello?

1:15:35.035 --> 1:15:36.703
Eli. Wait. Who is this?

1:15:36.745 --> 1:15:37.912
-Nick, put Eli on.
-Hang on.

1:15:41.041 --> 1:15:44.586
Just talk to Eli.
I'm sorry, Lucas.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:46.046
She just doesn't wanna talk
to you.

1:15:46.087 --> 1:15:46.963
Where are you?

1:15:48.006 --> 1:15:49.215
We're at Recessions
on 18th and L.

1:15:49.257 --> 1:15:50.050
LUCAS:
Bullshit!

1:15:50.717 --> 1:15:51.217
You're at the campaign office.

1:15:51.259 --> 1:15:52.385
I'm on my way.

1:15:52.427 --> 1:15:53.887
Don't do anything stupid.

1:15:53.928 --> 1:15:56.181
They sing karaoke this good
at the campaign?

1:15:56.222 --> 1:15:58.641
[indiscernible singing]

1:15:59.934 --> 1:16:01.227
Shit! All right.

1:16:01.269 --> 1:16:03.021
Just tell her to stay
right there.

1:16:03.063 --> 1:16:05.732
(***)

1:16:09.652 --> 1:16:18.620
(***)

1:16:27.671 --> 1:16:36.638
(***)

1:16:45.689 --> 1:16:49.651
(***)

1:16:49.693 --> 1:16:50.652
ELI:
Shit!

1:16:50.694 --> 1:16:53.947
(***)

1:16:56.408 --> 1:16:58.785
What the hell
are you doing here?

1:16:58.827 --> 1:17:02.122
-It's past midnight.
Lucas isn't--
-I have numbers, emails, names.

1:17:02.163 --> 1:17:03.957
[scoffs] Sorry, what?

1:17:03.998 --> 1:17:08.128
Tom Mayfield, Spencer Erickson,
Dean Clifton, Patriot Catering.

1:17:08.169 --> 1:17:11.047
I have concrete evidence
of all parties involved.

1:17:11.089 --> 1:17:12.048
You give me one good reason

1:17:13.216 --> 1:17:13.383
right now I shouldn't call
Secret Service

1:17:14.092 --> 1:17:14.676
and throw you in jail.

1:17:15.802 --> 1:17:17.012
-We'd be sharing a cell.
- NATE: Bullshit.

1:17:17.053 --> 1:17:18.972
I would think twice
before you call security.

1:17:19.014 --> 1:17:21.474
The story is already written.
It's in the drafts.

1:17:21.516 --> 1:17:24.978
You have me arrested,
it goes on Twitter instantly.

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:26.813
Newspapers in the morning.

1:17:26.855 --> 1:17:28.273
What's this little story about?

1:17:28.314 --> 1:17:30.108
-You know what it's about.
-Enlighten me.

1:17:30.150 --> 1:17:31.818
ELI:
What it's always about.

1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:32.819
Money.

1:17:35.864 --> 1:17:37.907
-Did you know?
-NATE: Know what?

1:17:37.949 --> 1:17:40.493
All I know is I love my country.

1:17:40.535 --> 1:17:41.745
All right? I'm our best hope.

1:17:42.871 --> 1:17:44.039
I give us a fighting chance.

1:17:47.709 --> 1:17:48.710
Wow.

1:17:48.752 --> 1:17:52.714
(***)

1:17:57.844 --> 1:17:59.262
Are you a patriot, Eli?

1:17:59.304 --> 1:18:02.015
Patriots don't steal
from the American people.

1:18:02.057 --> 1:18:03.475
Who are you to accuse anyone of
stealing,

1:18:03.516 --> 1:18:05.477
you fucking hypocrite?

1:18:05.518 --> 1:18:06.436
Give it to me.

1:18:14.069 --> 1:18:16.029
[sighs]

1:18:16.071 --> 1:18:18.365
You know, I think you and I
have a lot in common, Eli.

1:18:18.406 --> 1:18:20.367
And for one,
we both lack experience.

1:18:20.408 --> 1:18:22.077
Turnbull and Archer are
canaries
with that attack line.

1:18:22.118 --> 1:18:25.038
I'm ahead
in every one of the polls,

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:28.041
economy, hot buttons,
but the race, still a dead heat.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:29.376
Why is that?

1:18:29.417 --> 1:18:31.795
'Cause unfortunately,
for me and for you,

1:18:31.836 --> 1:18:32.837
experience seems to matter.

1:18:34.881 --> 1:18:35.507
The way I see it,

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:39.052
your story
might cause a little stir.

1:18:39.094 --> 1:18:41.471
When it comes down to it,
who's gonna believe you?

1:18:41.513 --> 1:18:43.390
You lack the most vital asset
a journalist must have,

1:18:43.431 --> 1:18:45.308
credibility.

1:18:45.350 --> 1:18:47.894
Looks like I'm late
to the party.

1:18:47.936 --> 1:18:50.271
-Uh, Mr. Booker.
What a surprise--
-Sit the fuck down.

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:52.941
Now...

1:18:54.317 --> 1:18:57.320
let us all take a deep breath

1:18:57.362 --> 1:18:59.406
and talk this out

1:18:59.447 --> 1:19:02.242
like the rational people we are.

1:19:02.283 --> 1:19:03.368
Nate, don't say a word.

1:19:03.410 --> 1:19:04.577
Eli records everything
on her phone.

1:19:04.619 --> 1:19:05.995
-What?
-Let me see.

1:19:06.037 --> 1:19:07.163
Get off! It's not on me.

1:19:09.457 --> 1:19:10.792
Hey! No, no. Leave him out.

1:19:11.751 --> 1:19:12.961
-NICK: That won't be necessary.
-NATE: Hey!

1:19:13.003 --> 1:19:13.920
You wanna talk or what?

1:19:21.177 --> 1:19:22.178
What the fuck?

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:23.805
NATE:
All right.

1:19:23.847 --> 1:19:24.264
All right?

1:19:26.474 --> 1:19:27.434
Let's just take a deep breath.

1:19:29.477 --> 1:19:31.104
Sit down and talk this out,
okay?

1:19:31.146 --> 1:19:33.314
This is obviously some sort
of huge misunderstanding.

1:19:33.356 --> 1:19:34.607
NICK:
We know what you did.

1:19:34.649 --> 1:19:35.817
NATE:
Okay.

1:19:36.651 --> 1:19:36.985
With all due respect,
I have no idea

1:19:37.861 --> 1:19:38.153
what you guys are talking about.

1:19:38.903 --> 1:19:39.237
NICK:
Maybe you don't.

1:19:40.321 --> 1:19:42.032
But right now,
there are two assholes

1:19:42.073 --> 1:19:44.200
saying you do.

1:19:44.242 --> 1:19:46.911
There's no need for us to
bluff.
We don't have a smoking gun.

1:19:46.953 --> 1:19:49.622
But as my esteemed colleague
has no doubt informed you,

1:19:49.664 --> 1:19:51.291
we've got the bullets,
the casings,

1:19:51.332 --> 1:19:54.044
and the goddamn forensic report.

1:19:54.085 --> 1:19:58.631
The whole story tied in a bow,
just waiting for the proof

1:19:58.673 --> 1:20:00.383
that you knew about it.

1:20:01.926 --> 1:20:06.014
If we do decide to print,
you got every news outlet

1:20:06.056 --> 1:20:09.434
in the country
on a scavenger hunt for proof

1:20:10.935 --> 1:20:11.853
of your involvement.

1:20:12.896 --> 1:20:13.355
There is no proof
of my involvement.

1:20:14.939 --> 1:20:16.441
The allegation itself knocks
you
out of the White House.

1:20:16.483 --> 1:20:18.193
You'll spend the next few years
in court.

1:20:19.152 --> 1:20:20.862
And if you did know,

1:20:20.904 --> 1:20:22.572
the next couple of decades
in prison.

1:20:23.948 --> 1:20:27.202
So, the way I see it,
if you want any hope

1:20:27.243 --> 1:20:31.247
of reversing this unfortunate
chain of events,

1:20:31.289 --> 1:20:34.459
you will tell us
the God's honest truth

1:20:34.501 --> 1:20:36.544
right here and now.

1:20:37.587 --> 1:20:38.505
Okay. Uh--

1:20:38.546 --> 1:20:41.383
But before you do,

1:20:43.259 --> 1:20:45.178
a disclaimer.

1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:47.597
I've worked in this town
for 52 years.

1:20:49.057 --> 1:20:52.352
That makes me one
of the world's foremost experts

1:20:52.394 --> 1:20:54.604
at spotting a liar.

1:20:54.646 --> 1:20:57.899
Lie to me, and you lose...

1:20:59.567 --> 1:21:01.986
the election and your freedom.

1:21:04.155 --> 1:21:06.408
But lucky for you,

1:21:06.449 --> 1:21:10.578
the truth may still set you
free
because believe it or not,

1:21:10.620 --> 1:21:14.582
I'm still grappling
with a truly punishing question.

1:21:16.334 --> 1:21:17.335
Is it worth it?

1:21:17.377 --> 1:21:21.297
(***)

1:21:27.345 --> 1:21:28.263
I don't have a party war chest.

1:21:28.304 --> 1:21:29.097
Okay?

1:21:31.224 --> 1:21:32.267
This thing
was just a temporary fix

1:21:32.308 --> 1:21:34.060
to get me to the starting line.

1:21:34.102 --> 1:21:35.395
We were gonna give it all back
as soon as we're in a position

1:21:35.437 --> 1:21:36.479
to do so.

1:21:39.274 --> 1:21:40.692
This is no harm, no foul.
It's victimless.

1:21:40.734 --> 1:21:41.693
Tell that to the class

1:21:41.735 --> 1:21:43.945
of invisible kids
in West Virginia.

1:21:46.197 --> 1:21:48.033
I don't know.

1:21:48.074 --> 1:21:48.950
How do we make this okay? Huh?

1:21:51.494 --> 1:21:53.538
First interview
after I'm sworn in.

1:21:53.580 --> 1:21:56.166
Exclusives for eight years
after that.

1:21:56.207 --> 1:21:57.709
If there's a leak
coming from the White House,

1:21:57.751 --> 1:21:59.544
you're the two pots catching
it.
You have my word!

1:22:02.589 --> 1:22:03.548
Eli.

1:22:04.716 --> 1:22:05.467
What about Penny?

1:22:07.093 --> 1:22:08.595
You worry
for your sister's safety

1:22:08.636 --> 1:22:10.597
every day
that she's serving overseas.

1:22:10.638 --> 1:22:12.557
And with your father
undergoing chemotherapy...

1:22:16.561 --> 1:22:19.481
I can't imagine how hard
that must be.

1:22:21.107 --> 1:22:22.359
And your sister, Penny, is it?

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:24.486
Lieutenant Penelope James.

1:22:25.612 --> 1:22:27.155
We can work out

1:22:27.197 --> 1:22:29.574
an honorable discharge for her
the day I'm sworn in.

1:22:29.616 --> 1:22:31.117
Your sister deserves
to be with your dad

1:22:31.159 --> 1:22:32.160
during his treatments.

1:22:33.536 --> 1:22:35.413
If I wasn't so inexperienced,

1:22:36.706 --> 1:22:38.500
I would think you were using
a commissioned officer

1:22:38.541 --> 1:22:40.377
as collateral in a bribe.

1:22:45.131 --> 1:22:47.676
I would more call it
an agreement amongst friends.

1:22:49.511 --> 1:22:50.512
Look, I feel for you, Eli.

1:22:52.681 --> 1:22:53.807
[sighs softly]

1:22:53.848 --> 1:22:56.017
Cancer took my mom.

1:22:56.059 --> 1:22:58.269
And the emotional toll is hard.

1:22:59.354 --> 1:23:00.271
But the treatments add up.

1:23:01.731 --> 1:23:03.358
And until we can get in there
and reform

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:06.236
the healthcare system,
I don't want your parents

1:23:06.277 --> 1:23:08.029
to be crushed under the weight
of medical bills.

1:23:09.614 --> 1:23:11.324
And we can make sure
that doesn't happen.

1:23:12.534 --> 1:23:14.369
We are on the same team here.

1:23:15.745 --> 1:23:17.706
And if you wanna make real,
lasting change,

1:23:17.747 --> 1:23:20.667
well, you just gotta play
the game,

1:23:20.709 --> 1:23:21.751
and that's the reality of it.

1:23:25.130 --> 1:23:26.798
You were supposed to change
the game.

1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:35.765
(***)

1:23:44.858 --> 1:23:53.783
(***)

1:23:55.201 --> 1:23:57.829
I had a hunch I'd find you here.

1:23:57.871 --> 1:23:59.497
ELI:
I'm getting it all down.

1:23:59.539 --> 1:24:01.541
Everything that crooked,
fucking conman's done.

1:24:01.583 --> 1:24:03.793
We don't have enough to publish.

1:24:03.835 --> 1:24:05.503
[sighs]

1:24:05.545 --> 1:24:08.131
-But he just admitted--
-Unless we find hard evidence

1:24:08.173 --> 1:24:12.177
that Sterling himself knew,
we're just a couple of trees

1:24:12.218 --> 1:24:13.678
falling in the woods.

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:14.679
So, what do we do now?

1:24:16.097 --> 1:24:17.182
NICK:
Tear it all up.

1:24:17.223 --> 1:24:19.142
Everything we know.

1:24:19.184 --> 1:24:21.436
I'll track Sterling to his
rally
in Atlanta,

1:24:21.478 --> 1:24:25.440
and see if we can crack

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:52.467
(***)

1:25:01.267 --> 1:25:03.645
ELI:
Mom! Dad! Where are you?

1:25:05.271 --> 1:25:06.147
I'm calling the police.

1:25:07.190 --> 1:25:07.482
They-- they trashed
my apartment!

1:25:09.818 --> 1:25:12.195
[pants]

1:25:12.237 --> 1:25:14.197
-What are you doing here?
-Thank God you're okay.

1:25:14.239 --> 1:25:16.741
-I looked everywhere.
-No. Get out, Lucas.

1:25:16.783 --> 1:25:19.285
-HAL: Eli, calm down,
sweetheart--
-ELI: Daddy.

1:25:19.327 --> 1:25:21.371
-HAL: Lucas told us.
-No. Okay?

1:25:21.413 --> 1:25:22.831
Don't believe a word
that he has to say. Okay?

1:25:24.457 --> 1:25:24.499
NATE (ON RECORDING):
This thing was just
a temporary fix

1:25:25.417 --> 1:25:25.458
to get me to the starting line.

1:25:26.334 --> 1:25:26.376
We're gonna give it all back

1:25:27.627 --> 1:25:27.669
as soon as we're in a position
to do so.

1:25:29.754 --> 1:25:31.506
This is no harm, no foul.
It's victimless!

1:25:32.966 --> 1:25:33.008
ELI (ON RECORDING):
Tell that to the class
of invisible...

1:25:33.425 --> 1:25:33.883
[gasps]

1:25:36.386 --> 1:25:37.429
Oh, my God.

1:25:39.681 --> 1:25:40.390
Did Nick know?

1:25:40.432 --> 1:25:42.183
LUCAS:
No.

1:25:42.225 --> 1:25:43.393
He still doesn't.

1:25:44.811 --> 1:25:46.771
I had to commit, or his face
would have given me away.

1:25:48.356 --> 1:25:50.400
And honestly,
I didn't decide to do it

1:25:50.442 --> 1:25:52.193
until I was standing
outside of the office.

1:25:57.866 --> 1:25:58.992
[sighs]

1:25:59.034 --> 1:26:01.411
You know,
this doesn't fix everything.

1:26:01.453 --> 1:26:02.662
LUCAS:
I know.

1:26:02.704 --> 1:26:04.205
I needed you to be wrong.

1:26:06.916 --> 1:26:07.876
I love you.

1:26:10.670 --> 1:26:11.588
It's all I got.

1:26:13.298 --> 1:26:14.257
[sighs]

1:26:16.009 --> 1:26:17.761
I need to tell Nick.

1:26:17.802 --> 1:26:20.472
He's on his way
to Sterling's rally right now.

1:26:20.513 --> 1:26:21.598
I'm flying with the campaign.

1:26:21.639 --> 1:26:23.266
I'll track him down
and tell him.

1:26:23.308 --> 1:26:24.851
-You go work on your story.
-I'll just call him.

1:26:24.893 --> 1:26:26.227
LUCAS:
That might be difficult.

1:26:26.269 --> 1:26:27.312
The last time I saw
Nick's phone,

1:26:28.188 --> 1:26:29.647
it was floating
in Sterling's coffee.

1:26:29.689 --> 1:26:30.648
[sighs]

1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:33.234
Right.

1:26:35.570 --> 1:26:36.780
CORRESPONDENT 14 (ON TV):
Nate Sterling

1:26:38.198 --> 1:26:39.282
will be in Atlanta tonight
while Senator Turnbull

1:26:39.324 --> 1:26:41.701
travels to Florida.

1:26:41.743 --> 1:26:43.995
CORRESPONDENT 15 (ON TV):
And Nate Sterling is trending on
social media as excitement...

1:26:44.037 --> 1:26:45.246
CORRESPONDENT 16 (ON TV):
Senator Turnbull leads

1:26:46.247 --> 1:26:47.540
all candidates
in total campaign spend,

1:26:49.042 --> 1:26:50.335
having raised more cash
than both Sterling and Archer

1:26:50.377 --> 1:26:51.836
for the third month in a row.

1:26:53.963 --> 1:26:54.881
ELI:
Lucas.

1:26:55.674 --> 1:26:55.757
LUCAS (OVER CELLPHONE):
Hey.

1:26:56.341 --> 1:26:56.758
Did you find him?

1:26:57.884 --> 1:26:59.052
-[indistinct chatter]
-Uh, no. Not yet.

1:26:59.094 --> 1:27:00.970
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
Where are you?

1:27:01.012 --> 1:27:02.972
I'm by ATB.

1:27:03.014 --> 1:27:05.016
CORRESPONDENT 17:
...A declaration
of Independence.

1:27:07.894 --> 1:27:10.605
And some are calling Sterling
the most influential...

1:27:10.647 --> 1:27:11.898
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
Nothing?

1:27:11.940 --> 1:27:14.359
It's like a zoo with no cages.

1:27:14.401 --> 1:27:17.487
CORRESPONDENT 18:
Here we are at Nate Sterling's
biggest rally yet.

1:27:17.529 --> 1:27:18.488
He's about to do a hit

1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:19.948
on Politics Nightly
with Jane Bower.

1:27:21.032 --> 1:27:21.282
CORRESPONDENT 19:
...Tramping its way

1:27:22.492 --> 1:27:22.909
through America's
two-party landscape.

1:27:23.576 --> 1:27:25.453
[indistinct speech]

1:27:25.495 --> 1:27:28.331
...by two points
with just one week to go.

1:27:28.373 --> 1:27:30.458
[indistinct speech]

1:27:36.339 --> 1:27:37.298
I got him.

1:27:39.843 --> 1:27:41.344
CORRESPONDENT 1:
...Just over a year ago.

1:27:41.386 --> 1:27:42.971
[indistinct shouting]

1:27:45.515 --> 1:27:47.600
LUCAS:
I-- I-- I--
I need to talk to him.

1:27:47.642 --> 1:27:49.352
-I need to talk to Mr. Booker.
-No access here, sir.

1:27:49.394 --> 1:27:50.729
JANE (ON TV):
Nate Sterling is set to take

1:27:52.230 --> 1:27:52.605
the stage any minute now
to make his closing arguments.

1:27:53.606 --> 1:27:54.899
Shit. Call back when you get
him.

1:27:56.609 --> 1:27:56.651
JANE (ON TV):
... by Nicholas Booker,
esteemed columnist

1:27:58.278 --> 1:28:00.447
for the Washington Chronicle
and lion of the fourth state.

1:28:00.488 --> 1:28:01.906
The election is a dead heat.

1:28:01.948 --> 1:28:03.199
JANE:
If it's anything

1:28:03.241 --> 1:28:04.993
like the last two elections,
it could come down

1:28:05.035 --> 1:28:07.370
to a few thousand votes
in a handful of swing states,

1:28:07.412 --> 1:28:11.875
or if it's a repeat of 2000,
a few hundred votes.

1:28:11.916 --> 1:28:14.669
Your column is read
by a few million.

1:28:14.711 --> 1:28:16.087
Your readers
really listen to you.

1:28:16.129 --> 1:28:17.380
They trust you.

1:28:17.422 --> 1:28:18.840
I call it like I see it.

1:28:18.882 --> 1:28:19.883
What do you see here?

1:28:23.678 --> 1:28:25.930
[crowd cheering]

1:28:25.972 --> 1:28:34.898

1:28:52.957 --> 1:28:56.169

1:28:56.211 --> 1:29:00.006
Well, I have good news
and bad news.

1:29:00.048 --> 1:29:01.591
Which do you want first?

1:29:01.633 --> 1:29:02.884
SUPPORTER (ON TV):
The bad!

1:29:02.926 --> 1:29:03.968
NATE (ON TV)
Right!

1:29:04.010 --> 1:29:06.888
Okay, here it is.

1:29:08.598 --> 1:29:11.851
My little girl
turned 21 yesterday.

1:29:13.561 --> 1:29:15.063
And the first thing Alison did
was make sure

1:29:15.105 --> 1:29:16.940
her voter registration
was current.

1:29:16.981 --> 1:29:18.733
[crowd cheering]

1:29:21.778 --> 1:29:22.737
Hello.

1:29:23.863 --> 1:29:25.407
No. No, no, no, no.
Slow down.

1:29:31.496 --> 1:29:32.455
Okay.

1:29:33.748 --> 1:29:34.749
Okay.

1:29:34.791 --> 1:29:43.758

1:29:52.809 --> 1:29:56.771
(***)

1:30:00.900 --> 1:30:02.235
...And the other just sits
on its hands

1:30:02.277 --> 1:30:03.194
and whines about it.

1:30:08.450 --> 1:30:09.784
'Cause Alison deserves better.

1:30:09.826 --> 1:30:12.787
Our young people deserve better.

1:30:12.829 --> 1:30:14.831
They deserve to look
forward to the future

1:30:14.873 --> 1:30:19.085
the way we used to with hope,
with pride, with excitement.

1:30:19.127 --> 1:30:20.086
Holy shit.

1:30:20.128 --> 1:30:21.087
GORDON:
"Holy shit" what?

1:30:21.129 --> 1:30:25.091
(***)

1:30:26.134 --> 1:30:27.135
Holy...

1:30:28.178 --> 1:30:28.928
This is unreal.

1:30:42.650 --> 1:30:43.818
LUCAS:
Oh. Hey, Lynn. I got it.

1:30:46.279 --> 1:30:47.655
[sighs]

1:30:52.202 --> 1:30:55.080
So sorry for your loss,
Mrs. James.

1:30:55.121 --> 1:30:56.706
LYNN:
Thank you.

1:30:56.748 --> 1:30:59.626
And thank you for being so good
to my daughter.

1:30:59.668 --> 1:31:02.712
You and your husband have
raised
a fine young woman.

1:31:10.261 --> 1:31:12.263
Let's...

1:31:12.305 --> 1:31:14.015
How fast can you finish
the story?

1:31:17.936 --> 1:31:19.521
I'm about to bury my dad.

1:31:23.191 --> 1:31:24.609
Maybe you should just take over.

1:31:25.985 --> 1:31:28.113
It's your story.

1:31:28.154 --> 1:31:30.865
You found it. You pushed it.
You're writing it.

1:31:33.535 --> 1:31:36.037
And if we're doing it,
we gotta be quick.

1:31:36.079 --> 1:31:37.831
We've got 24 hours, tops.

1:31:38.873 --> 1:31:40.792
And it's gotta be airtight.

1:31:41.876 --> 1:31:43.044
I'll take care of the rest.

1:31:45.296 --> 1:31:46.214
And...

1:31:49.551 --> 1:31:50.719
I'm sorry about your father.

1:32:07.777 --> 1:32:09.279
Hello, Eli.

1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:10.572
ELI (OVER PHONE):
Nick and I have a story

1:32:11.740 --> 1:32:12.741
ready for publication
that just might decide

1:32:13.908 --> 1:32:15.160
the next president
of the United States.

1:32:15.201 --> 1:32:17.037
Is that so?

1:32:17.078 --> 1:32:18.705
Should I be worried?

1:32:18.747 --> 1:32:21.207
Why do you wanna be president,
Senator Turnbull?

1:32:22.334 --> 1:32:23.835
TURNBULL (OVER PHONE):
Look, Eli.

1:32:23.877 --> 1:32:27.380
I assume we don't agree
on most policy.

1:32:27.422 --> 1:32:30.633
But one thing we do both value
is the truth.

1:32:30.675 --> 1:32:32.719
So, I'm gonna give you mine.

1:32:32.761 --> 1:32:36.056
Right now, I am running
as the leader of my party,

1:32:36.097 --> 1:32:37.891
but should
I be fortunate enough

1:32:37.932 --> 1:32:39.976
to take that oath
on January 20,

1:32:41.019 --> 1:32:44.314
I will be governing
as the leader of my country.

1:32:46.149 --> 1:32:48.026
Our democracy is fragile.

1:32:49.611 --> 1:32:52.906
You protect it from the outside
by doing what you do.

1:32:52.947 --> 1:32:55.158
And if I get the chance,
I'm going to protect it

1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:58.787
from the inside
with everything I've got.

1:33:00.288 --> 1:33:01.289
ELI:
And off the record?

1:33:04.167 --> 1:33:05.168
Take care, Eli.

1:34:18.033 --> 1:34:27.000

1:34:28.209 --> 1:34:29.502
I don't understand.

1:34:29.544 --> 1:34:32.088
What's-- what's so special
about this one?

1:34:36.134 --> 1:34:37.260
LYNN:
The day you were born.

1:34:40.972 --> 1:34:41.931
[sighs]

1:34:45.143 --> 1:34:46.478
I never got to say goodbye.

1:34:48.063 --> 1:34:50.482
We thought it was another
false alarm from the chemo.

1:34:52.984 --> 1:34:55.195
He knew that you were
at the Chronicle, writing.

1:34:55.236 --> 1:34:56.780
[sighs]

1:34:56.821 --> 1:34:58.031
LYNN:
He insisted

1:34:58.073 --> 1:34:59.908
that that was where you needed
to be.

1:35:02.952 --> 1:35:04.746
He loved you.

1:35:07.332 --> 1:35:08.917
He's so proud.

1:35:12.337 --> 1:35:13.338

Daddy.

1:35:26.142 --> 1:35:35.110
(***)

1:35:38.363 --> 1:35:39.322
Okay.

1:36:16.943 --> 1:36:18.945
[phone rings]

1:36:24.367 --> 1:36:25.452
KEVIN (OVER CELLPHONE):
Where are you?

1:36:25.493 --> 1:36:27.370
-Kevin?
-Hey, where are you?

1:36:27.412 --> 1:36:28.538
ELI (OVER CELLPHONE):
I'm at my parents' house.

1:36:28.580 --> 1:36:29.956
All right.

1:36:29.998 --> 1:36:30.498
Meet me at the diner
on 4th and Delaware

1:36:31.249 --> 1:36:32.417
in 20 minutes. All right?

1:36:34.210 --> 1:36:34.252
-I'm not doing that.
-KEVIN (OVER CELLPHONE): It's an
emergency.

1:36:34.919 --> 1:36:34.961
What is this about?

1:36:35.587 --> 1:36:36.296
Look, I was fired.

1:36:36.338 --> 1:36:37.255
Why?

1:36:37.297 --> 1:36:38.882
Because I-- I know the names,

1:36:38.923 --> 1:36:41.259
Tom Mayfield, Dean Clifton,
and Spencer Erickson.

1:36:46.181 --> 1:36:47.974
[indistinct chatter]

1:36:51.478 --> 1:36:53.480
How the fuck do you know
those names?

1:36:53.521 --> 1:36:55.315
The-- the um-- the other night

1:36:55.357 --> 1:36:58.026
when you got that call
and you left in a hurry,

1:36:59.611 --> 1:37:03.573
well, you didn't log out.
And Gordon assumed it was mine.

1:37:05.325 --> 1:37:08.495
Look, I didn't say anything,
'cause I was in shock

1:37:08.536 --> 1:37:10.246
and Gordon flipped for it.

1:37:10.288 --> 1:37:11.289
I thought I'd be waking up
to a headline

1:37:12.415 --> 1:37:13.375
that would change
the course of history.

1:37:14.584 --> 1:37:15.627
So, why did I instead wake up
to an email

1:37:17.212 --> 1:37:18.129
informing me that the Chronicle
was terminating my contract?

1:37:18.838 --> 1:37:19.339
I mean, I rushed to the office,

1:37:20.715 --> 1:37:21.091
and security wouldn't even
let me in the building.

1:37:22.258 --> 1:37:23.927
Apparently, Gordon had HR
clean out my desk

1:37:23.968 --> 1:37:25.178
and wipe my desktop.

1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:27.097
Gordon killed the story
to save his own ass.

1:37:28.473 --> 1:37:30.517
-Why-- why would he--
- ELI: Jack Hampton.

1:37:30.558 --> 1:37:32.519
He's a huge Sterling supporter.

1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:33.520
Gordon prints the story,

1:37:34.604 --> 1:37:35.063
Hampton orders
his head on a platter.

1:37:36.189 --> 1:37:37.357
Gordon kills the story,
Sterling wins.

1:37:37.399 --> 1:37:38.525
Guess which paper
has a direct line

1:37:38.566 --> 1:37:39.526
to the Oval Office.

1:37:42.570 --> 1:37:45.281
So, Gordon is playing politics

1:37:45.323 --> 1:37:47.992
dirtier
than the goddamn politicians?

1:37:50.412 --> 1:37:51.371
[scoffs]

1:37:54.624 --> 1:37:57.419
Please nail that motherfucker.

1:37:58.503 --> 1:37:59.587
I can't believe

1:37:59.629 --> 1:38:01.006
you let Gordon think
it was your story.

1:38:03.216 --> 1:38:06.594
Look. I never said that it was.

1:38:06.636 --> 1:38:08.972
And as it turns out,
I did you a favor.

1:38:10.557 --> 1:38:12.559
So, you're welcome. Hmm?

1:38:19.607 --> 1:38:21.109
No, Eli. I got it. Please.

1:38:22.235 --> 1:38:23.236
You're unemployed.

1:38:23.278 --> 1:38:25.280
It wouldn't be right. Prick.

1:38:30.952 --> 1:38:32.120
Have you shown Gordon the story?

1:38:33.121 --> 1:38:33.204
NICK (OVER CELLPHONE):
I'm waiting for you.

1:38:34.539 --> 1:38:34.581
You should get to see
the look on his face.

1:38:35.874 --> 1:38:36.708
-Where the fuck are you?
-I'm on my way.

1:38:37.792 --> 1:38:39.085
Whatever you do,
don't talk to Gordon.

1:38:43.089 --> 1:38:45.467
And I thought I'd seen it all.

1:38:50.388 --> 1:38:51.389
We're doing this?

1:38:51.431 --> 1:38:53.016
[chuckles]

1:38:54.309 --> 1:38:56.227
ELI:
What?

1:38:56.269 --> 1:38:58.563
The weight of the world
lies in the palm of my hand.

1:38:58.605 --> 1:39:00.482
I guess I thought
it'd be a bit heavier.

1:39:01.566 --> 1:39:03.318
[chuckles softly]

1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:07.072
You know what this means
if we go through with this.

1:39:11.534 --> 1:39:13.161
And you're willing?

1:39:13.203 --> 1:39:16.206
I guess that's why they call it
the moment of truth.

1:39:18.750 --> 1:39:20.001
It's your story.

1:39:23.296 --> 1:39:24.673
What?

1:39:24.714 --> 1:39:27.592
No. I-- I stumbled upon it,
yeah, but you guided me.

1:39:30.762 --> 1:39:32.806
If you hadn't have gotten me
that interview

1:39:32.847 --> 1:39:35.600
-at Meyers & Goldstein--
-You would have gotten it
in some other way.

1:39:35.642 --> 1:39:36.685
I doubted you.

1:39:38.395 --> 1:39:40.397
You fought through the doubt.

1:39:40.438 --> 1:39:41.523
You took me for the ride.

1:39:43.149 --> 1:39:45.610
I didn't provide anything
that you didn't already--

1:39:45.652 --> 1:39:47.362
You can now.

1:39:47.404 --> 1:39:48.196
What?

1:39:48.238 --> 1:39:49.239
Credibility.

1:39:50.532 --> 1:39:52.742
Sterling was right.
Nobody knows my name.

1:39:52.784 --> 1:39:56.329
And those that do
aren't so fond of it.

1:39:56.371 --> 1:39:58.289
If I were to publish this
on my own,

1:39:58.331 --> 1:40:01.543
it wouldn't get any traction.
Or worse, it'll get dismissed.

1:40:03.253 --> 1:40:06.715
But coming from Nicholas
Booker,
it'll be on every front page

1:40:06.756 --> 1:40:08.591
and television network
in minutes.

1:40:09.843 --> 1:40:11.386
We need to do this together.

1:40:12.804 --> 1:40:15.390
And after we break the story,
we can set up our own shop.

1:40:16.850 --> 1:40:19.227
No editor or parent corporation

1:40:19.269 --> 1:40:21.521
to tell us what
we can and can't print.

1:40:21.563 --> 1:40:25.525
A publication that answers
to nothing but the facts,

1:40:25.567 --> 1:40:26.568
wherever they lead.

1:40:28.611 --> 1:40:29.654
What would we call it?

1:40:32.198 --> 1:40:33.116
The Independent.

1:40:36.661 --> 1:40:37.787
The Independent.

(***)

1:41:49.651 --> 1:41:50.735
Now, what?

1:41:51.986 --> 1:41:53.321
What do you say
we get the hell out of here?

1:41:55.323 --> 1:41:56.783
And go where?

1:41:56.825 --> 1:41:58.785
Watch the fireworks
from the hill.

1:41:58.827 --> 1:42:02.789

1:42:36.489 --> 1:42:37.699
50 years, Gordon.

1:42:39.325 --> 1:42:40.702
I didn't know you had it in you.

1:42:44.956 --> 1:42:49.294
I was just trying to protect
everyone in here.

1:42:49.336 --> 1:42:52.839
And I'm just trying to protect
everyone out there.

1:42:52.881 --> 1:43:01.806

1:43:02.891 --> 1:43:03.850
Take care, Gordon.

1:43:07.854 --> 1:43:09.439
Think they'll read this one
in West Virginia?

1:43:11.733 --> 1:43:12.692
Hmm.

1:43:12.734 --> 1:43:21.701

1:43:28.583 --> 1:43:31.294
* Oh, beautiful *

1:43:31.336 --> 1:43:34.964
* For heroes proved
in liberating strife *

1:43:46.726 --> 1:43:50.563
* Who more than self
their country loved *

1:43:54.734 --> 1:43:58.905
* And mercy more than life *

1:44:05.787 --> 1:44:09.708
* America, hmm, America *

1:44:14.087 --> 1:44:17.716
* May God thy gold refine *

1:44:20.051 --> 1:44:23.847
* Till all success be nobleness
and every gain divined *

1:44:36.026 --> 1:44:37.527
* And you know,
when I was in school *

1:44:37.569 --> 1:44:38.653
* We used to sing it
something like this *

1:44:38.695 --> 1:44:39.946
* Listen here *

1:44:39.988 --> 1:44:43.867
* Oh, beautiful
for spacious skies *

1:44:50.915 --> 1:44:53.918
* For amber waves of grain *

1:44:59.341 --> 1:45:03.011
* For purple mountain,
majesties *

1:45:08.058 --> 1:45:12.020
* Above the fruited plain *

1:45:13.772 --> 1:45:14.689
* But now, wait a minute *

1:45:16.024 --> 1:45:19.861
* I'm talking about America,
sweet America *

1:45:26.493 --> 1:45:30.121
* You know, God done
shed his grace on thee *

1:45:32.999 --> 1:45:36.795
* He crowned thy good,
yes, he did, in brotherhood *

1:45:42.759 --> 1:45:46.638
* From sea to shining sea *

1:45:48.807 --> 1:45:50.642
* You know
I wish I had somebody *

1:45:50.684 --> 1:45:51.726
* To help me sing this *

1:45:51.768 --> 1:45:55.605
* America *

1:45:55.647 --> 1:45:56.690
* America *

1:45:58.525 --> 1:46:00.902

His grace on thee *
