Ohhh! Hey!

03:12.600 --> 03:14.600
- Sorry.
- [Huffs]

03:14.600 --> 03:17.000
So then, 2:00 a.m.
My boss calls me...

03:17.000 --> 03:20.500
wants me to search her car for,
get this, a stray Vicodin.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.100
- Shut up.
- Hello, fellow grunts.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.000
Hey.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.200
I mean, making me drop off
her stool sample was one thing.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.600
But this? I'm so asking for a raise.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.300
Yeah! You know, I was thinking
I've been due for a raise too, 'cause...

03:35.300 --> 03:37.800
Oh, did I tell you?
That cute new shaman's in my department now.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.900
<i>- Mm. He was in my training class.</i>
- Right.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.600
Nice chatting with you too. Bye-bye.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.200
- Which actually makes him sexier.

<i>- [Beeps, Whirring]</i>
<i>- [Man] Hey.</i>

04:01.900 --> 04:05.600
- Morning.
- You just can't... There are rules.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.800
Oh, I know. It's so unfair.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.100
Just because my boss
is your boss's boss...

04:10.100 --> 04:12.000
his needs coming first and all.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.600
<i>- [Beeps]</i>
- See ya.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.700
So, you've got
the department heads at 11:00.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.300

04:46.500 --> 04:48.800
- Oh.
- [Woman, Recording] Greetings, Your Eminence.

Sheesh.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.000
You figure out the catering
for tomorrow?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.900
- Hello! I just...
<i>- [Gunn] Morning.</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:02.200

05:03.700 --> 05:06.100
So, about the, uh, catering...

05:06.100 --> 05:08.600
I really went above and beyond...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.500
<i>'cause I know this is very...</i>

05:11.600 --> 05:14.300
[Sighs]
You're welcome.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.300
- You're up today.
- Oh, come on, Rudy.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.500
You know I've been off
the human blood for months.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.500
Company policy. Give me the finger.

Good morning.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.000
Uh, sorry. Wrong extension.
You need 529 for Curses.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.400
Foiled again, huh?
[Giggles]

05:40.400 --> 05:44.100
- Hello?
- You're clean. Have a good one.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.200
[Sighs]
Eli. Hi.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.100
[Chuckles]
Hey... you.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.200
I just got called up
for a meeting with your boss man.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.700
- Really? I didn't see any...
- I don't want to count my hatchlings...

05:57.700 --> 06:01.400
but I think the honchos are finally starting
to recognize my work in Accounting.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.700
- Hey. Good for you.
- Eli. Come on in.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.600
Wish me luck, kiddo.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.300
Ohhh.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Angel, you forgot your...
[Gasps]

06:31.000 --> 06:34.200
Get that cleaned up, would you?

07:27.300 --> 07:31.100
<i>I just... I don't get it.</i>
<i>Why'd you kill Eli?</i>

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
Didn't much like
what he was doing in his off-hours.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.000
Well, that's not right.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.300
- What Eli did on his own time...
- Is dismember virgins.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.300
Oh. Well, a person's religious beliefs
is no cause for...

07:41.300 --> 07:43.700
He did it for his own amusement.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.300
Oh. Well, okay.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.400
Still, couldn't you have given him
a stern warning or something first?

07:50.400 --> 07:54.200
It's called a zero-tolerance policy,
not a "maybe-this-once" policy.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.100
Nobody in this office
gets away with murder.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.000
<i>Not anymore.</i>

07:58.000 --> 08:01.900
Ohhh. Lemme guess.
Position just open up in accounting?

08:01.900 --> 08:05.000
<i>Hardest part of thejob...</i>
<i>terminating an employee.</i>

08:05.000 --> 08:07.200
Once again,
keeping corporate America safe from evil.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.500
- Spike.
- I was wonderin' when you'd turn up.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.300
Where have you been?
It's been days.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.100
Out enjoying freedom
from my ghostly confines, luv.

08:14.100 --> 08:18.500
There haven't been any side effects since
you recorporealized, have there?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.700
Bit of a hangover, but that's
to be expected after all the drinking.

08:21.700 --> 08:26.000
Just thought I'd swing by
and say my final farewells.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.500
- You're leaving?
- You catch on quick, don't you?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.900
Yeah, thought I'd push off, seeing as
how I got somebody waiting for me.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
<i>[Wesley]</i>
<i>Angel, I'm not sure that's wise...</i>

08:35.000 --> 08:36.900
given the Shanshu prophesy
is still unresolved.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.000
That's your problem, mate.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.100
You're welcome to that heroic destiny,
whether you deserve it or not.

08:42.100 --> 08:46.000
Me, I've got better things to do than
wait around for the four bloody horsemen.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.300
- Spike.
- Let him go.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.200
Yeah, here's the thing.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.900
Could use a little walking-around money.
How 'bout a few hundred?

08:51.900 --> 08:55.300
- How 'bout, no?
- Typical, you cheap sod.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.200
Right, then.
Settle for some wheels.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.400
If it's gonna get you out
of here faster, fine.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.700
- Just not the Viper.
- Viper it is, then.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.600
- Any message for Buffy?
- Tell her you're a moron.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.600
<i>Well, bon voyage, Spikester.</i>

09:08.600 --> 09:10.500
Don't be a stranger.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.800
Fred.
[Exhales Deeply]

09:14.800 --> 09:16.700
I want you to know, uh...

09:16.700 --> 09:19.800
I mean, all that work you put in tryin' to,
you know, cure me of the ghosties...

09:19.800 --> 09:22.200
I didn't do anything.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.200
Oh, you did.
You... You believed in...

09:27.000 --> 09:30.700
I mean, you tried.
I won't forget that.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.300
You're welcome.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.600
Oh, what?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.700
I don't get a good-bye
just because I went crazy...

09:39.700 --> 09:42.300
and tried to rip your throat out
while we were having sex?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.600
Keep it simple, Harm.
It suits you.

09:49.700 --> 09:53.400
This is war. Two demon clans,
the Vinjis and the Sahrvin.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.500
They've been battling it out
for five generations.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.600
Way back when,
clans got along okay.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.800
Shared a few hundred miles of desert,
traded livestock...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
and even partied together
once in a while.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.100
Then a Vinji used the wrong fork
at a Sahrvin bonding ceremony.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.700
<i>Sahrvins took offense, and they've been</i>
<i>slaughtering each other ever since.</i>

10:08.700 --> 10:11.400
You're saying this whole thing
started over a fork faux pas?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.100
They're pretty finicky about manners.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.600
But the clans have agreed
to negotiate a truce...

10:15.600 --> 10:18.000
- Here, tomorrow.
- Why now?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.200
Demon rights activist by the name
ofTobias Dupree got involved.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.500
He's liaison to both clans...
only guy in the world they all trust.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.500
And he called us for help.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.800
Etiquette aside,
the Vinji and Sahrvin are notoriously vicious.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.000
Why not let them
wipe each other out?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.800
I got no love for these guys.
But we manage to push through a peace plan...

10:33.800 --> 10:35.700
the whole demon world's
gonna know we got game.

10:35.700 --> 10:40.800
That makes sense, in a kind of gray,
Machiavellian kind of way.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.700
Obviously, both clans are
sensitive to the smallest slight.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.600
<i>We don't dot an "l"or cross a "T,"</i>
<i>this whole thing could explode in our faces.</i>

10:46.600 --> 10:49.000
<i>This is a complete list</i>
<i>of manners and customs.</i>

10:49.000 --> 10:50.900
We should probably all memorize this.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.800
<i>Apparently, gazing at a Vinji's ankles</i>
<i>can lead to eye-gouging.</i>

10:54.800 --> 10:56.700
Ah. Hey, come on, Dandido.
Come on.

10:56.700 --> 11:00.600
<i>[Chuckles] He gets a wee shy</i>
<i>around the big boss. All the way in, yeah.</i>

11:00.600 --> 11:02.800
<i>I, uh, finished the seating chart.</i>

11:05.600 --> 11:09.600
<i>All right. This kid was up all night,</i>
<i>jigsawing who's going where tomorrow.</i>

11:09.600 --> 11:11.600
He's a real up-and-comer, this one.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.400
<i>[Fred] My lab managed that upgrade to</i>
<i>the weapons scanner, like you requested.</i>

11:15.700 --> 11:17.700
- Foolproof?
- I'd say yes...

11:17.700 --> 11:20.200
but then some fool would just come along
and sneak something past us.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
But it's still state of the art.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.600
And since none of the clan
representatives speak English...

11:24.600 --> 11:27.200
- I'll be doing most of the talking.
- You?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.600
Yeah. Along with the law
and the Gilbert and Sullivan...

11:29.600 --> 11:31.900
also got me a few demon languages
in the brain upload.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.500
<i>So aside from forks, ankles</i>
<i>and us not knowing what they're saying...</i>

11:35.500 --> 11:37.400
any other potential minefields?

11:37.400 --> 11:40.700
All their etiquette issues go along
with a healthy dose of superstition.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.400
You don't know the half of it. I've been doing
a whole bunch of research on these guys...

11:44.400 --> 11:46.600
their customs and stuff.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.700
Did you know that they think poodles
are wicked bad luck?

11:49.700 --> 11:52.000
Harmony, I'm glad you're here.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.400
- We'll be needing lunch.
<i>- [Gunn] Good idea.</i>

11:54.400 --> 11:56.700
<i>- We should order before the crush.</i>
<i>- [Fred] Not Thai again.</i>

11:56.700 --> 11:58.500
- [Sighs]
<i>- Something lighter.</i>

12:00.100 --> 12:03.300
[Woman]
<i>Burkle's always giving Mr. Gunn the eye.</i>

12:03.300 --> 12:05.700
<i>- I heard they used to be a thing.</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

12:05.700 --> 12:08.500
Alice said she and that Knox guy
are pretty friendly.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.700
<i>Maybe she's sleeping with both of'em.</i>

12:10.700 --> 12:12.800
[Giggles]
That's what I'd do.

12:12.800 --> 12:17.400
Don't forget about Wesley. I get the vibe
that he's, like, totally crushing over Fred.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.600
Mr. Wyndam-Pryce?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.900
[Huffs]
Everyone knows he's... Muffins!

12:21.900 --> 12:24.400
They're from Lorne... actually from Shaq...

12:24.400 --> 12:26.800
but Lorne's declared his office
a carb-free zone.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.200
- He's totally grooming you.
<i>- You think?</i>

12:29.200 --> 12:31.400
He does call me "Dan the Man."

12:31.400 --> 12:35.100
- Angel grooms me too.
- Explains the haircut.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.200
I'm his right arm. He's taking me places.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.900
<i>- [Ringing]</i>
- We're so connected.

12:41.900 --> 12:46.300
- Yeah, boss?
- Harmony, get the hell down here. Now!

12:46.300 --> 12:48.900
Uh, sure. No. No, trouble at all.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.900
That's what I'm here for. Bye.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.300
Harmony!

12:59.700 --> 13:01.600
You want to explain this?

13:02.600 --> 13:06.000
Okay. This is totally my fault.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.400
I specifically told the caterers
the delivery was for tomorrow.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.700
<i>But I should've called to confirm.</i>

13:11.700 --> 13:14.300
<i>You know caterers...</i>
<i>not the best listeners.</i>

13:14.300 --> 13:16.200
- Oh!
- [Bellows]

13:16.200 --> 13:18.900
Harmony, uh, got us a camel.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.600
Like I said, I did a lot of research.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.900
Camel meat's a delicacy.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.600
So I thought it would be a great way
to kick off the summit...

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
'cause of the clans being so uptight.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.700
Like... comfort food.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.200
- Comfort food?
- Uh-huh.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.900
And as host,
you get the honor of slicing off its hump...

13:34.900 --> 13:36.800
and sticking a hot poker
through its heart.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.800
And then the demon leaders
rip apart its carcass with their bare hands.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.200
[Chuckles]
Are you...

13:43.200 --> 13:45.500
<i>[Sighs]</i>
<i>I don't even know h-how...</i>

13:45.500 --> 13:48.500
Uh, maybe the camel
was the wrong way to go.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.800
You were supposed to answer the phones,
make appointments and anticipate my needs...

13:51.800 --> 13:55.500
which does not include
a petting zoo in my lobby.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.400
Okay, but...
the caterer said no returns.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.300
- [Snorts]
- Get it out of here.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.600
Maybe you could
go with a nice cheese platter.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.300
[Crying]

14:06.300 --> 14:09.700
Or chips and dip.
Chips and dip would be fine.

14:10.900 --> 14:13.800
I did everything right.
This is what they eat.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.500
Angel's just feeling a little off...

14:16.500 --> 14:21.200
and he-he's not in the mood to,
you know, butcher a camel.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.700
- No, he hates me!
- No!

14:24.700 --> 14:26.600
He'll get over it.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
Everybody hates me.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.300
L... I don't hate you.

14:31.300 --> 14:34.900
- [Sniffles]
- I mean, it's just I don't know you that well, and...

14:34.900 --> 14:37.000
What are you doing after work?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.100
[Bellows]

14:40.400 --> 14:43.300
And the worst part is,
I can't even quit.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.300
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.800
<i>I'm sure that's not...</i>

14:47.800 --> 14:49.600
Really?

14:49.600 --> 14:53.400
I tried being out on my own,
all independent and evil.

14:53.400 --> 14:58.000
- I'm just no good at it.
<i>- But... But, I mean, isn't that a good thing?</i>

14:58.000 --> 15:00.200
Not like everything's
so great now.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.000
You heard Angel.
I'm useless.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.900
Harmony, it was one mistake.

15:04.900 --> 15:08.400
And you can't take everything
Angel says so personally.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.900
He... He has a lot on his mind.

15:11.900 --> 15:15.400
[Sighs]
I just wish I were more like you.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.900
You know, except for the part
about being all into science...

15:17.900 --> 15:19.700
and not having a lot up front.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.700
I mean,
you have two hot guys after you.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.500
I do?

15:26.500 --> 15:29.000
All the girls,
they think it's Knox and Gunn.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.100
Of course, I know it's Knox and Wesley.
Not that they'd listen.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
It is Knox and Wes, right?

15:35.200 --> 15:39.200
Yeah. I mean, no!
L... I don't know.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.400
We all work together,
and there's a lot of baggage and...

15:43.400 --> 15:45.300
Why am I telling you this?

15:45.300 --> 15:47.600
Because we're totally bonding.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.100
We're, like, gal pals.
This is awesome.

15:50.100 --> 15:53.700
You can teach me about life,
and I can teach you how to dress better.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.000
Oh.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.400
They are both kinda hot,
aren't they?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.500
Knox and Wes. L...

16:02.500 --> 16:07.000
Wait. Why is everyone at the office
so interested in who I might be dating?

16:07.000 --> 16:10.900
Because you're at the top. People want to
know what's happening with the bigwigs.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.800
You'd think they'd ask me, but...

16:12.800 --> 16:15.400
- Why don't they?
- [Sighs]

16:15.400 --> 16:19.400
Harmony, do you...
do you not have many friends at work?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.900
I just... I don't get it.

I used to be way popular
in high school.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.400

Just since I got vamped
at my graduation...

16:29.300 --> 16:31.500
I've had trouble
connecting with people.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.600
Well, maybe you should...

16:34.600 --> 16:38.000
you know,
put yourself out there more.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.300
I mean, lots of Wolfram and Hart people
hang out right here.

- They're all straight.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.800

16:47.800 --> 16:50.400
I gravitate more towards
the undead variety.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.300
Well, there's your problem.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.600
The undead,
they're not exactly givers.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.500
I'm sure there are tons of straight guys
who would love to get to know you.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.200
Well, there is one at the bar.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.400
Don't!

17:03.400 --> 17:05.200
I think he's checking me out.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.099
You should go talk to him.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.300
Oh, no. I couldn't.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.400
I'm hanging with my gal pal.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.599
I would never do that to you.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.500
- Don't be silly. I'd be fine if...
- Okay. Bye.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.599
Oh, what do I say?

17:19.599 --> 17:23.599
Oh, um, just say "Hi"
and introduce yourself.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.800
I bet he takes it from there.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.600
Right. But what if he doesn't take it?

17:29.600 --> 17:32.300
Well, questions are always good.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.900
Ask him where he's from
and what he does for a living.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.600

- Angel sent you, didn't he?
- Angel?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.500
He's all antsy about the demon summit,
so he sent you here to rush me...

26:15.500 --> 26:17.700
only he doesn't want to seem
like he sent you here to rush me...

26:17.700 --> 26:20.300

Oh! Yeah. Totally.
You know our Angel.

could have blacked out...

- See? Right-biter.
- Harmony, stop!

30:30.500 --> 30:34.400
- I lean right, which means I bite you on your...

30:34.700 --> 30:36.900
Right. I mean correct.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.800
And since he was bitten
on his right...

30:38.800 --> 30:40.700
he had to have been bitten
by a left-biter.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.100
Ergo, not me.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.300

36:55.700 --> 36:58.900
- Funny how that wasn't on the tape.
- They're still demanding a...

37:05.200 --> 37:07.400
[Screams]

37:10.600 --> 37:12.200
I didn't mean to do that yet.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.200
I can explain?

37:32.200 --> 37:35.200
You should've just come to me.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.600
Gee, I wish I would've
thought of telling her that.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.500
I'm really, really sorry, you guys.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.400
I totally wouldn't have hit you over the head
and put you in the closet...

37:43.400 --> 37:46.100
if I didn't have a really good reason.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.200
It's just...

37:48.200 --> 37:50.400
I was scared and...

37:55.500 --> 37:58.900
I know you never wanted me
as your assistant, and...

37:58.900 --> 38:00.500
<i>[Sighs]</i>

38:00.500 --> 38:03.500
Okay, I've made some bad choices.

38:03.500 --> 38:07.100
I mean, it's not like I have a soul.
I have to try a lot harder.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.700
[Wesley]
How's it going in there?

38:11.700 --> 38:15.000
Well, so far no heads are rollin'.
How about in here?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.900
<i>Harmony could have</i>
<i>handled it better...</i>

38:16.900 --> 38:19.000
<i>but she didn't kill anyone.</i>

38:21.100 --> 38:25.400
You'll be clean in two days.
But I'll be watchin' you.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.900
I know.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.900
He won't
have to be watching, 'cause...

38:35.100 --> 38:38.400
I'll just pack up my desk.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.000
<i>Harmony...</i>

38:45.000 --> 38:47.500
just bring us some coffee.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.600
<i>So I saved the summit</i>
<i>by killing the skank who tried to frame me...</i>

38:58.600 --> 39:00.900
and all I get is,
"Get me some coffee."

39:00.900 --> 39:02.900
You believe that?

39:02.900 --> 39:06.600
Oh. Hey, can I get another,
but with one of those little umbrellas?

39:06.600 --> 39:09.500
<i>- We're out.</i>
- Right. Figures.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.100
Yeah, life's
an ever-lovin' bitch, isn't it?

39:12.100 --> 39:15.900
- What are you doing here?
- At the moment, hearin' a bit of your story of woe.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.700
But what happened to Europe?

39:18.700 --> 39:21.700
Aren't you supposed to be
Slayer-chasing or something?

39:21.700 --> 39:24.900
I was on my way. [Sighs]
Had a boat ticket and all.

39:24.900 --> 39:27.100
Then I put a little thinkin' into it.

39:27.100 --> 39:30.900
[Huffs] A man can't go out
in a bloody blaze of glory, savin' the world...

39:31.200 --> 39:32.900
<i>and then show up</i>
<i>three months later...</i>

39:32.900 --> 39:35.100
tumbling off a cruise ship
in the south of France.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.400
<i>I mean, I'd love to,</i>
<i>don't get me wrong.</i>

39:38.400 --> 39:42.000
But, uh, it's hard
to top an exit like that.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.600
Come on.
Girls don't care about stuff like that.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.400
Just one look at you,
and she'll forget herself.

39:49.400 --> 39:53.400
She'll get all tingly, and it won't matter
how horribly you treated her in the past...

39:53.600 --> 39:55.600
and how you took her
for granted, and...

39:55.600 --> 39:57.400
Hey, I never took her for gr...

39:58.800 --> 40:00.700
Oh.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.600
[Exhales Deeply]

40:05.600 --> 40:08.400
Well, I'd expect Buffy
would be happy enough to see me.

40:08.400 --> 40:12.000
It's just I gave up my life for her,
the world...

40:12.000 --> 40:14.300
<i>and if I show up now, flesh and bone...</i>

40:14.300 --> 40:18.100
a grand finale
won't hold much weight.

40:18.100 --> 40:21.500
All of it won't matter.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.100
Yeah. Not mattering.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.900
[Sighs]
I know that feeling well.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.900
Oh, come on, Harm.
You matter to someone.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.900
- I do?
- Yeah.

40:35.900 --> 40:39.000
Girl tried to frame you, didn't she?
Must've mattered to her.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.200
<i>Everybody's talking about it.</i>

40:41.200 --> 40:43.900
You're right.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.500
That girl hated me.
She wanted me dead.

40:48.700 --> 40:52.500
- I matter.
- Yeah.
