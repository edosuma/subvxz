00:01.960 --> 00:04.470
Mommy, what's
the capital of Oregon?

00:04.470 --> 00:06.900
Oregon?
Port-- No, um...

00:06.900 --> 00:08.000
Salem.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
That's right.
Just seeing if you remember.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.510
Oh. Uh-oh,
we're out of milk.

00:12.510 --> 00:13.770
I'll get some.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.040
Better than homework.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.510
Oh, well,
thank you, Rebecca.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.850
Gum?

00:21.850 --> 00:24.590
One pack.
Then come straight home.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.290
( puppies whimpering )

00:31.290 --> 00:34.190
GIRL:
He's so cute.
Can I have one, Mom?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.800
Oh, not today, sweetie.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.100
Have to wait till
we get a bigger place, okay?

00:38.100 --> 00:39.900
Your mom's right,
little buddy.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.370
Dogs need a lot of room
to run around,

00:43.370 --> 00:44.570
just like kids.

00:45.570 --> 00:47.040
Come on, let's go.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.050
( man talking indistinctly )

00:53.050 --> 00:54.480
Yeah, that's right.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.390
TRIVETTE:
Brr!

01:00.390 --> 01:02.390
Man, I got to tell you,

01:02.390 --> 01:05.330
surveillance on a rooftop
is not my idea

01:05.330 --> 01:08.330
of the adventurous life
of a Texas Ranger.

01:08.330 --> 01:10.660
Builds character,
Trivette.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.830
I don't have character?

01:11.830 --> 01:13.330
Yeah, you got character.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.500
Just don't have
any patience.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.070
I was patient
all last night.

01:16.070 --> 01:17.400
You complained
all last night.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.870
I was freezing.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.470
I had aches,
and I had pains.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.680
What about you?

01:22.680 --> 01:23.840
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.750
You're the guy that
doesn't feel anything.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.620
You know, a sniper in Nam
could lay here for 36 hours

01:30.620 --> 01:33.120
without moving a muscle.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.520
TRIVETTE:
And what about
going to the bathroom?

01:36.530 --> 01:39.360
I told you,
he didn't move a muscle.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.790
Yeah, right.
Well, not the kid, man.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.500
The kid gives
Mother Nature her due.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.570
Behind a tree.
That's why she invented it.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.340
How long do we
got to stay out here?

01:52.340 --> 01:54.810
We're not leaving here
until they arrive,

01:54.810 --> 01:57.640
even if it takes a month.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.480
Like I told you, Trivette,

01:59.480 --> 02:01.810
patience is a virtue.

02:03.050 --> 02:07.050
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

02:07.060 --> 02:08.919
( puppies whimpering )

02:11.530 --> 02:13.330
Free, huh?

02:13.330 --> 02:15.190
Even had their shots.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.730
I hate to part with
the little critters,

02:16.730 --> 02:18.730
but I can only keep two.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.240
Wish I could have one.
But my mom works,

02:21.240 --> 02:22.640
and it'd be alone all day.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.570
Nobody likes being lonely,

02:25.570 --> 02:28.210
especially dogs.

02:28.210 --> 02:29.640
You can pet him,
if you like.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.410
Go ahead, hold him.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.080
( laughs )

02:34.480 --> 02:36.820
( screaming )

02:41.760 --> 02:44.560
(<i> light rock action theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

03:32.340 --> 03:33.510
TRIVETTE:
A week.

03:33.510 --> 03:34.610
It's been a week, Walker.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.080
You think maybe
they're not coming?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.480
The Coyote said
the last shipment

03:37.480 --> 03:39.180
was delayed at the border.

03:39.180 --> 03:41.250
I got an idea.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.450
Let's drop an electronic
sensor down there,

03:43.450 --> 03:46.950
and then come back
when they trip it.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.760
I've got a better idea.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.960
Why don't we
leave a note,

03:49.960 --> 03:53.060
and when they arrive,
they can call us?

03:53.060 --> 03:55.700
Very funny.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.830
( vehicle approaching )

04:01.770 --> 04:05.210
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

04:05.210 --> 04:07.610
Well, well, well.

04:07.610 --> 04:10.110
Looks like we won't
have to leave a note after all.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.920
( speaking in Spanish )

04:18.920 --> 04:20.250

( continues
speaking in Spanish )

04:29.100 --> 04:31.630
( shouting in Spanish )

04:47.480 --> 04:49.780
MAN:
Nice work, Otillo.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.280
Nice work, my man.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.390
You got the money?

04:53.390 --> 04:55.220
Yeah, in a grain sack.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.360
Just like Jesse James.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.170
I'm sorry your last run
got delayed.

05:05.170 --> 05:08.230
New border guard,
I heard.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.170
Now dead, I heard.

05:10.170 --> 05:11.270
Well, I always said

05:11.270 --> 05:14.340
you were not
a man to cross, Otillo.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.550
I'm out of here.

05:18.550 --> 05:19.850
WALKER:
Where you going?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.820
How about jail?

05:22.820 --> 05:24.680
Texas Rangers.

05:24.690 --> 05:26.390
Well, I only see one.
( men shouting )

05:27.260 --> 05:28.920
I only see work for one.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.260
Ooh, tough monkey.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.390
Yeah, right.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.460
You haven't
seen anything yet.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.570

TRIVETTE:
You kept me up all week,
double ugly,

05:45.770 --> 05:47.140
and I'm mighty tired.
Ow!

05:48.410 --> 05:50.510
I got this thing
about slavery.

05:50.510 --> 05:51.780
You understand
what I'm saying?

05:51.780 --> 05:53.550
( men groaning )

05:58.420 --> 06:00.450
All right, I see how you
shot him in the foot.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.190
I see how you shot him
in the hand.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.420
But how the hell did you
nick him in the right ear?

06:04.430 --> 06:06.290
The right ear?

06:06.290 --> 06:08.760
I was trying for his left ear.

(<i> mellow, rustic theme playing</i> )

Yes. And as I'm running
the bath water,

06:19.040 --> 06:20.970
I'm gonna be
whipping up an omelet,

06:20.980 --> 06:23.380
and putting
clean sheets on my bed.

06:25.450 --> 06:28.350
Rangers Walker
and Trivette.
Hey, Alex.

06:28.350 --> 06:30.780
This is Kay Senstad
and Meredith Clancy.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.850
They've come to ask us
for our support and--

06:32.860 --> 06:34.490
Hey, Alex, can we
save this for later?

06:34.490 --> 06:36.590
'Cause we've been
out on that stakeout

06:36.590 --> 06:37.990
for over eight days.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.030
Mrs. Senstad's daughter

06:40.030 --> 06:42.000
disappeared eight days ago.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.030
I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.530
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Uh, aren't the police involved?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.340
KAY:
The police haven't
turned up anything.

06:48.340 --> 06:51.870
Rebecca went to the market,

06:51.870 --> 06:54.470
and she never came back.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.750
Are there any leads, Alex?

06:59.750 --> 07:02.550
Some guy in a van
giving away free puppies.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.320
Now there's no trace of him.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.650
You're the only one
that can help.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.420
Are you a relative?

07:09.190 --> 07:10.690
I had the vision.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.260
What?

07:12.260 --> 07:15.430
MEREDITH:
I felt it when
Rebecca was taken away.

07:15.430 --> 07:16.830
And then,
later, it came to me

07:16.830 --> 07:19.670
that I could find her
with the help of a Texas Ranger.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.500
One with the letter C
in his name.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.640
My name begins with W,
and my partner's is T.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.910
Cordell Walker.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.680
You've gotta help me.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.080
Please?

07:38.050 --> 07:39.720
I know you
don't believe her.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.290
I can feel
your contempt.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.890
Yes, ma'am,
I am concerned.

07:43.890 --> 07:45.890
Police departments have
used psychics before,

07:45.890 --> 07:47.630
all over the country,
successfully.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.690
I've checked on it.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.830
I know they have.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.900
Then why won't you
give her a chance?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.840
Ma'am, I'm sorry
about your daughter,

07:55.840 --> 07:59.270
but folks in your situation
can be easy targets.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.240
You're saying
she's a fraud?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.540
I don't know if
she is a fraud or not.

08:05.010 --> 08:07.810
Some psychics do have the gift,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.720
but many of them are fakes.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.620
And I just don't want you
to be taken advantage of.

08:11.620 --> 08:15.560
Then where else do I turn?
She seems sincere.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.090
It's my little girl,
Ranger Walker.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.060
She's all I've got
in the world.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.700
My partner and I will do
everything humanly possible

08:26.700 --> 08:28.400
to find your daughter.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.070
I promise.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.710
( phone rings )
Excuse me.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.440
Walker.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.110
TRIVETTE:
Want some herbal tea
or something?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.480
I'm fine, thank you.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.850
I had a girlfriend in college
who used to read those to me.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.690
Really?
Some of the stories
were pretty good.

08:46.690 --> 08:49.020
Actually,
some of 'em were true.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.060
So you're not
as skeptical as your partner?

08:52.060 --> 08:54.290
No, I didn't say that.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.060
I find the psychic world
pretty interesting,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.530
but I wouldn't go so far as
to invest my retirement in it.

09:01.540 --> 09:05.310
Besides, the dang girl left me
over what the cards said.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.640
WALKER:
So did she
read you your fortune?

09:10.310 --> 09:12.550
Said I should have been born
rich instead of good-looking.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.380
Well, did she also tell you
I'm going to Austin?

09:15.380 --> 09:17.380
No.
Well, I am.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.390
I've got to meet
with some legislative committee,

09:19.390 --> 09:21.890
regarding this illegal
alien problem we've got.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.460
Means I'm stuck
with the voodoo lady.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.030
Look, I told
Mrs. Senstad we would

09:27.030 --> 09:29.060
do everything we could
to find her child.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.130
Just make sure
she doesn't rip her off, okay?

09:31.130 --> 09:32.130
Okay.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.310
TRIVETTE:
Usual, big dog.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.340
C.D.:
Yeah, why don't you
just go home, Jimmy,

09:41.340 --> 09:42.640
and get some sleep?

09:42.640 --> 09:45.140
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

09:45.150 --> 09:46.780
Why don't you let
the psycho figure it out?

09:46.780 --> 09:48.480
Psychic, C.D.
Psychic.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.650
I'll tell you,

09:49.650 --> 09:52.150
Walker really roped me
into one this time, boy.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.690
Yeah, old Cordell, yeah.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.960
You think he's not thinking,
but let me tell you something,

09:55.960 --> 09:57.660
he's always got
his ducks in a row.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.360
Yeah, I went with
a little ol' gal one time.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.960
Short, fat.
I could eat soup off her head.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.000
She thought
she had psychic power.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.870
I'd love to hear about it
some time, big guy.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.840
Now, Jimmy,
wait a minute.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.070
She had a toehold on my head
worse than old Mabel's got.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.910
Yes, sirree,
she had me tied up

10:12.910 --> 10:14.770
worse than a hog
lookin' at a wristwatch.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.410
You're gonna have to explain
that to me some time, C.D.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.810
You never hypnotized a hog?

10:19.810 --> 10:21.450
You know what she said?

10:21.450 --> 10:22.980
She said we'd solve this case

10:22.990 --> 10:24.550
with a Ranger
with a C in his name.

10:24.550 --> 10:26.690
Well, Cordell's not here.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.690
I think she's talking
about you, C.D.

10:29.690 --> 10:32.590
( chuckles )
Get outta here.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.430
( breezy country music
playing over speaker )

10:38.300 --> 10:40.230
ALEX:
She's seeing horses.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.500
Yeah.
A lot of horses in Texas.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.700
Maybe she's talking
about California.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.010
There's no scenery
or anything.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.010
It's--

10:48.010 --> 10:49.710
It's just lights.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.610
I don't know, the horses...

10:53.620 --> 10:55.350
...they don't
seem to be alive.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.650
Maybe they're
in a glue factory.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.120
( whispers ):
I really think that we--

10:59.120 --> 11:00.450
Damn!
I'm sorry.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.360
Sorry, I'm losing it.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.230
Don't force it.
Just let it come to you.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.760
Yeah.
Sometimes I push too hard.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.600
Why don't we call it a day?

11:09.600 --> 11:12.300
Jimmy, she's just
trying to help.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.770
A little girl's life
could be at stake here.

11:16.570 --> 11:18.900
You know, I'm gonna go back
to the office and do what I do.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.170
I'm gonna check on
some M.O.'s

11:20.180 --> 11:21.640
and some parole records,
all right?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.180
Meredith,
I really don't think

11:23.180 --> 11:24.810
there's anything
that you can do here.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.850
She could work with
the sketch artist.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.920
But you could work with
the sketch artist, maybe.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.220
I knew you'd think
that was a good idea.

11:33.220 --> 11:34.820
I'll call and set it up
for tomorrow.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.060
All right.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.500
( carnival music playing )

11:42.500 --> 11:44.460
( children squealing )

11:44.470 --> 11:46.370
( man speaking indistinctly
over P.A. )

12:06.290 --> 12:09.620
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

12:34.820 --> 12:37.280
I just want
to be your friend.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.750
I don't want to hurt you.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.190
I really don't.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.620
It's your move.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.490
I want my mommy.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.590
I'm going to take
good care of you.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.930
My mommy takes
care of me fine.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.700
I can do better.
Move.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.140
Crown me.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.180
Just like all the rest.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.950
But I just--
Cheated!

13:06.950 --> 13:08.810
Did not!
Just like Carol Anne,

13:08.820 --> 13:10.280
you moved them
when I wasn't looking.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.490
Now, you pick 'em up. Now.

13:13.650 --> 13:15.390
Who's Carol Anne?

13:15.390 --> 13:17.790
You keep acting bad,
I may take you to meet her.

13:18.860 --> 13:20.130
( whispers ):
I don't like this.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.760
What?
I don't like you!

13:22.760 --> 13:25.730
Don't you ever
talk to me like that!

13:29.140 --> 13:30.940
( Trivette sighs )

13:30.940 --> 13:33.110
Oldfield was paroled
from Huntsville six months ago.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.140
No violations.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.680
( phone ringing in background )

13:36.680 --> 13:39.680
He looks so kind.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.210
When I started to see him
last night,

13:41.220 --> 13:43.480
actually,
it struck me that...

13:43.480 --> 13:44.750
he could be kind.

13:45.220 --> 13:46.990
Wallace.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.730
Back in the slammer.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.130
Cold eyes, huh?

13:57.130 --> 13:59.630
No, more, uh...

13:59.630 --> 14:01.940
More...hurt, really.

14:04.470 --> 14:07.010
Okay, how about
a Norval Hayes?

14:07.010 --> 14:10.140
Kidnapped
a Carol Anne Slater in '84,

14:10.150 --> 14:11.840
killed her a week later.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.080
And angry.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.320
TRIVETTE:
Paroled to Dallas
five months ago.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.050
Hasn't reported in eight weeks.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.720
Why do they let these guys out?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.690
If I prosecute him,
he won't get out.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.130
I'm losing it.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.730
Hey, Jimmy.
Yeah.

14:27.730 --> 14:28.900
I've got a blind date
tonight.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.230
You suppose she could
tell me what she looks like?

14:31.230 --> 14:33.100
RANGER 2:
Or what kind of time
he's gonna have?

14:33.100 --> 14:34.600
Way she's working,

14:34.600 --> 14:36.940
probably have
this solved by sundown.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.670
It's faster than
you'll solve anything, Fitch.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.010
Here's your perp,
Trivette.

14:47.850 --> 14:48.880
Thanks.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.850
I appreciate that.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.890
Oh, my God.

14:53.890 --> 14:57.620
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

14:57.630 --> 15:00.090
TRIVETTE:
It's the same guy.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.640
Got an address.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.880
Damn.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.480
That's $1000
I owe you.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.650
Well, come on, Rebecca.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.620
Come on.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.970
TRIVETTE:
Hayes' last known address
is up here on La Vista.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.000
She drew a good likeness
of him, did she?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.040
C.D., you don't really
have to do this, you know.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.100
What the little lady said
about the letter C

15:45.110 --> 15:46.310
probably did mean me.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.510
Yeah, she also said
it was kind of hazy too.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.980
I've been known
to that effect on women.

15:52.150 --> 15:55.610
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

16:04.790 --> 16:06.690
It's where you're going.
Shut up!

16:06.700 --> 16:08.430
It's where you belong.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.460
Go ahead! Just do what
you're gonna do to me!

16:10.470 --> 16:12.200
I don't care anymore.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.800
You and me, big dog.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.440
I think I seen a ghost
comin' up that chimney.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.610
I want to be your friend.

16:20.610 --> 16:23.480
I got friends at school.
I want to see them.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.080
I want to see my mommy.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.810
No, you can't do that.
They'll take you away from me.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.190
Why don't you have
friends your own age?

16:36.190 --> 16:38.090
Are you some kind of weirdo?

16:38.090 --> 16:39.320
Don't say that.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.660
You are. You are!

16:43.670 --> 16:45.700
Don't you ever say that!

16:46.200 --> 16:48.740
Texas Rangers!

16:51.110 --> 16:55.410
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

17:05.849 --> 17:07.550
( dog barking )

17:07.560 --> 17:09.790
WOMAN:
I'd give anything to know
where that man went to.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.890
It ain't been the same
around here without him.

17:11.890 --> 17:13.490
He never caused you
any trouble?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.060
Norval? I wish I had
a thousand tenants like him.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.500
Paid his rent on time,
in cash, did chores.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.930
Even fixed my window screens
without me asking.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.329
You a player?

17:22.339 --> 17:23.500
Who's your
favorite team?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.069
Rockets, all the way.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.040
Thanks.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.680
Norval took Robbie
to his first game.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.050
Robbie, he never seemed
strange to you at all?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.880
Norval's just
an overgrown kid.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.790
It's a little more
serious than that, ma'am.

17:39.790 --> 17:42.550
Look, if he comes back,
I need you to call us.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.130
( keyboard clicking )

17:56.070 --> 17:57.370
MAN:
Hi.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.140
What are you doing here?

17:59.140 --> 18:01.540
I thought you gave back
the key when you moved out?

18:01.540 --> 18:02.610
I found an extra.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.640
Get evicted again?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.410
( laughing ):
No.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.880
Well, things have been tight,

18:09.880 --> 18:11.680
you know,
hard times and all.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.020
You'd have had hard times
in the Roaring Twenties, Hank.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.060
You can't stay here.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.260
Look, I can help you out
with this Senstad thing.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.190
What is she paying you?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.330
Fifty a day.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.400
You could have got 75.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.430
Look, I feel something real
about this one, okay?

18:26.430 --> 18:28.430
I saw the guy.
I ID'd him.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.470
Honey, you have
always been for real.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.410
Pretty much, anyway.

18:34.410 --> 18:35.680
I'd like to
keep it that way.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.540
Well, sure. Sure.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.310
Look, there's no harm
in getting some publicity,

18:40.310 --> 18:42.550
and picking up
a little cash, huh?

18:42.550 --> 18:44.980
I mean, why should you
be different from anybody else?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.450
( laughs )

18:46.450 --> 18:47.650
If I wasn't different,

18:47.660 --> 18:49.990
I wouldn't be here
with you, now, would I?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.230
I'm working on something--

18:53.230 --> 18:54.490
Uh.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.900
Listen,
I want you to meet me

18:55.900 --> 18:57.260
outside the courthouse
at 3, okay?

18:57.260 --> 18:58.300
Why?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.830
Mm, surprise.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.870
( door closes )

19:15.320 --> 19:17.180
( men chattering )

19:20.960 --> 19:22.090
Rodney Glance?

19:25.930 --> 19:27.090
( tires squeal )

19:30.600 --> 19:31.600
( tires squeal )

19:38.410 --> 19:39.440
Hey!

19:40.810 --> 19:42.340
( grunting )

19:44.210 --> 19:47.250
Hey, I didn't do nothing.
Nobody said you did anything.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.080
I want to talk to you because
you were Norval Hayes' cellmate.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.750
Yeah, well, his parole officer's
already busted my chops.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.390
I need some information.

19:56.390 --> 19:59.260
I'm sitting on a psych report
that says he craves affection.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.530
He's a nice guy
until he's thwarted.

20:01.530 --> 20:02.700
You know anything about that?

20:02.700 --> 20:05.700
Nice guy, my butt.
Guy's a certified wacko.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.700
Where is he, Rodney?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.100
I don't know.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.100
You never talk to him?
No!

20:12.110 --> 20:14.640
I mean, he hangs out
where kids are.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.940
You know, the carnival,
arcades.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.680
The zoo, where he belongs.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.750
You didn't have to run.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.250
Well, I never saw a cop
that made me

20:26.250 --> 20:28.320
wanna do anything else.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.760
TRIVETTE:
This Norval Hayes sounds
like a real piece of work, C.D.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.730
Psych report says
everything's fine

20:33.730 --> 20:36.700
till his wires get crossed,
then all hell breaks loose.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.700
Yeah, just a bunch
of gobbledygook.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.930
We keep talking
to psychiatrists and psychos,

20:40.930 --> 20:42.670
we're gonna end up
arresting one another.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.970
I'm overcome with
a feeling, Trivette.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.070
Answer your phone.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.640
I feel it's gonna ring.

20:50.310 --> 20:53.280
( phone rings )

20:56.020 --> 20:57.820
Trivette.

20:57.820 --> 21:01.220
You go stick it
in your ear, Fitch.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.220
You too.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.420
( laughing )

21:10.430 --> 21:12.230
You're late.
I told you 3:00.

21:12.230 --> 21:13.430
I know. So what?

21:13.430 --> 21:15.500
Why did you wear this?
You look like a flake.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.800
I always dress like this.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.540
What's wrong with you?
Forget it. This way.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.740
Look, it wasn't easy for me
to set this thing up, okay?

21:20.740 --> 21:22.510
So don't blow it.
Let me do all the talking.

21:22.510 --> 21:24.880
You just look
preoccupied, all right?

21:24.880 --> 21:27.380
Okay.
You come off
better that way.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.780
They're waiting.

21:28.780 --> 21:32.050
It's the future, babe.
Hm? The future.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.620
Let's get some coffee.

21:38.290 --> 21:39.590
What the hell is she doing?

21:39.590 --> 21:42.560
Until Meredith came on board,
the investigation

21:42.560 --> 21:44.800
into Rebecca Senstad's
disappearance

21:44.800 --> 21:46.030
was at a standstill.

21:46.030 --> 21:47.770
Meredith, can you give us
any specifics

21:47.770 --> 21:49.700
on what you've
discovered so far?

21:49.700 --> 21:53.370
Well, um, discovered isn't
the term I would use exactly.

21:53.370 --> 21:55.780
It's-- It's more like
a sense that I get.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.180
Yes, and--
And Meredith Clancy

21:57.180 --> 22:00.080
has given the Rangers
a solid sense

22:00.080 --> 22:02.610
of what the kidnapper
looks like.

22:02.620 --> 22:05.020
So we're very confident
that it's just a matter of time

22:05.020 --> 22:07.150
before Meredith's
unique gift

22:07.150 --> 22:08.920
will lead the police
right to the child.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.020
TRIVETTE:
Cut the camera.
This interview is over.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.960
No. No, no. Keep it rolling.
Keep it rolling.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.730
This is Ranger James Trivette.
He is depending on Meredith

22:15.730 --> 22:18.460
to succeed where
his own department has failed.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.300
No. The DA's office is gonna
call a press conference

22:21.300 --> 22:22.970
as soon as there's
information to release.

22:22.970 --> 22:24.470
You want me to help you
with the camera?

22:24.470 --> 22:25.640
HANK:
That's all for now, Kim.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.010
What are you doing?

22:27.010 --> 22:28.840
HANK:
Hey, hey.
She's not on your payroll.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.310
She can talk
to whoever she likes.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.610
Who are you?

22:31.610 --> 22:33.910
This is Hank Meese.
He's a friend of mine.

22:33.910 --> 22:35.680
No, no. I'm, uh--
I'm her manager.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.180
You leave this case alone,
Hank Meese,

22:37.180 --> 22:38.980
or I'm gonna put you in jail
till it's over.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.820
Oh, now.
Come on, Jimmy.

22:40.820 --> 22:42.760
You're using Meredith
for your own good.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.820
Now, what's in it for her?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.460
You mean, for your own good.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.130
C.D., get him
out of my face.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.060
Get! Now!

22:49.060 --> 22:51.230
Going. Going.
Just, uh...

22:51.230 --> 22:53.130
I'll keep in touch, okay?

22:56.570 --> 22:57.800
I'm sorry.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.710
I--I just didn't
realize that...

23:00.710 --> 23:01.840
Was it so bad?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.240
Come on,
we'll take you home.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.350
MEREDITH:
Hank's always been that way.
I don't know.

23:06.350 --> 23:09.250
He's smart,
but in a dumb way, you know?

23:09.250 --> 23:10.880
I mean, I've tried
to tell him he just needs

23:10.890 --> 23:13.350
to let his own
natural talent shine through.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.450
Maybe he just
don't have none.

23:15.460 --> 23:16.660
Maybe that's the reason

23:16.660 --> 23:18.620
you're so damned
important to him.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.990
He didn't mean any harm.

23:19.990 --> 23:21.960
That's not the point.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.600
Norval Hayes could see
the interview.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.230
He's sick.

23:25.230 --> 23:28.030
He could panic, hurt Rebecca,
come after you.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.500
Oh, God.
Wait a minute.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.040
If anything happens
to that little girl

23:32.040 --> 23:33.610
because of what I...

23:34.810 --> 23:37.580
No. I can't think
like that.

23:37.580 --> 23:38.810
( sighs )

23:38.810 --> 23:40.850
I have to see her
peaceful and safe,

23:40.850 --> 23:43.420
surrounded by white light.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.520
( sighs )

23:47.860 --> 23:48.920
Oh, no.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.160
( gasps )

23:50.160 --> 23:52.460
There she goes again.
She's vapor locked.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.660
( Meredith
breathing heavily )

23:54.660 --> 23:55.800
What is it, Meredith?

23:55.800 --> 23:58.830
It's figures, like before.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.170
Moving confusion.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.540
Fear.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.540
( panting )

24:04.540 --> 24:06.740
It's near.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.480
It's near.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.540
Who we gonna
bust in on now, partner?

24:11.550 --> 24:12.580
Is it Rebecca?

24:13.850 --> 24:15.610
I don't know.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.420
But it's strong.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.550
( gasps )

24:19.590 --> 24:21.750
It's so strong.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.150
Here! Stop here!

24:29.560 --> 24:31.100
TRIVETTE:
Anything more?

24:31.100 --> 24:32.660
Partner, I think
we got trouble.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.900
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

24:37.300 --> 24:40.170
Meredith, lay down
on the seat.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.140
Don't get up
till we come back.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.320
Get over here!
Get down!

24:54.320 --> 24:55.920
Get down on the ground!
Get down!

24:55.920 --> 24:57.260
Open it! Now!
Get it open!

24:57.260 --> 24:58.860
Come on!
Turn around!

24:58.860 --> 25:00.460
( cans rattling )

25:00.460 --> 25:02.160
Check it out.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.760
( cash register beeping )

25:08.100 --> 25:10.240
Damn! This side.
Over here.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.340
Yes, sir.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.810
( people screaming )

25:18.810 --> 25:20.480
Over here, come on.

25:22.550 --> 25:23.550
Hurry!

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
Hey!

25:43.270 --> 25:45.770
( groaning )

25:51.680 --> 25:54.510
Damn. I hurt my hand.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.390
Hey.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.100
C.D.:
Well, you ought to showed up
about 30 minutes ago.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.900
Where the hell you been?

26:12.900 --> 26:15.400

You always do that.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.260
This is boring.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.600
NORVAL:
Ha! There, you missed.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.640
I'm not even trying
anymore.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.370
I wanna do
something else.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.250
<i> Coming up</i>

27:02.250 --> 27:04.450
I hate it here.

Here you go.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.580
Trivette?

29:44.580 --> 29:47.410
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I'm bringing her in.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.550
Alex, let me
call you back.

29:51.350 --> 29:52.750
Why didn't I see this?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.220
I should've known
Hank was in trouble.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.460
I should've
sensed something.

29:58.460 --> 29:59.560
Even if you'd have seen it,

29:59.560 --> 30:00.960
there's nothing
you could've done.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.630
It was me he was after,
wasn't it?

30:02.630 --> 30:04.560
He came here to kill me.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.430
He must've seen
that news report,

30:06.430 --> 30:07.930
like you said.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.770
I never should have
gotten involved with this.

30:09.770 --> 30:11.870
Meredith--
No, Jimmy, I quit.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.970
No more leading you on
wild goose chases, all right?

30:13.970 --> 30:15.310
You can't quit.

30:15.310 --> 30:16.910
Really? Why not?

30:18.950 --> 30:21.110
You didn't lead us
on a wild goose chase

30:21.120 --> 30:22.950
and you helped us
take down those slime bags

30:22.950 --> 30:24.350
at the market this afternoon.

30:27.790 --> 30:29.720
You wanna-- You wanna take
a look at this?

30:36.600 --> 30:38.360
It's her favorite toy.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.030
She never goes
anywhere without it.

30:41.030 --> 30:43.740
Well, then there's no question.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.140
the person
that killed Hank Meese

30:45.140 --> 30:47.210
is definitely the person
who has Rebecca.

30:47.210 --> 30:48.710
And he wanted
to be sure we knew it.

30:48.710 --> 30:50.210
Does he really think

30:50.210 --> 30:51.340
you wouldn't come
after him?

30:51.350 --> 30:54.210
Rational people
don't kidnap children.

30:55.850 --> 30:57.920
Hayes' prints are
all over the yo-yo.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.720
So now all we have to do
is find him.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.720
At least we know
Rebecca's still alive.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.560
( phone rings )

31:05.890 --> 31:07.090
Yes.

31:07.090 --> 31:09.490
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.800
Jimmy.
Yeah.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.530
Walker on two.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.330
Hey.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.670
I heard about
Meredith's friend.

31:16.670 --> 31:17.670
Is she okay?

31:17.670 --> 31:19.670
<i> Yeah, I think so.</i>

31:19.670 --> 31:21.110
So what do you think?
Is she for real?

31:21.110 --> 31:22.240
I tell you,

31:22.240 --> 31:24.010
it's starting to look
that way, big guy.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.140
I ran a check
on this Norval character.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.750
There's three cases in Texas
with the same M.O.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.950
You mean, since he was paroled?

31:29.950 --> 31:31.150
<i> Yeah.</i>

31:31.150 --> 31:33.120
Why don't you take Meredith
out to my ranch

31:33.120 --> 31:36.720
for safety and post a guard
at Mrs. Senstad's house.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.560
All right.
Hey, you ever coming home?

31:38.560 --> 31:40.220
Probably tomorrow.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.630
The sooner, the better.

31:41.630 --> 31:42.690
<i> Talk to you soon.</i>

31:42.700 --> 31:43.930
( woman laughs )

31:43.930 --> 31:45.900
MAN:
Be right back
with your crystal ball.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.500
( people laughing )

31:51.470 --> 31:53.770
(<i> kettle whistle blowing</i> )

31:56.080 --> 31:57.410
Just see if you can
get a read on her

31:57.410 --> 31:58.510
for me Uncle Ray, all right?

31:58.510 --> 32:00.180
Well, what's
your feeling, Jimmy?

32:00.180 --> 32:01.950
Confused.

32:01.950 --> 32:03.820
But you're a good judge
of character,

32:03.820 --> 32:06.080
so just tell me
what you think, all right?

32:06.090 --> 32:08.050
Okay.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.930
I hope you don't mind
my saying this...

32:19.930 --> 32:22.130
but you have
the most amazing aura.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.700
Aura?

32:23.700 --> 32:25.300
Yeah. It's so intense.

32:25.310 --> 32:28.640
I mean, all around you,
bright colors.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.410
Must be the reflection
of the fire.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.640
No. It's more than that.

32:32.650 --> 32:34.050
I should do
a reading for you.

32:34.050 --> 32:36.380
I have no use
for such devices.

32:36.380 --> 32:39.820
The spirits make themselves
known in their own way.

32:39.820 --> 32:43.020
I wonder about a person
who seeks to profit

32:43.020 --> 32:45.260
from the voices of the spirit.

32:45.260 --> 32:47.790
You see, they belong
to all of us,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.460
and we belong to them.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.930
And if they choose
to speak through you,

32:51.930 --> 32:54.530
it's a priceless gift.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.040
And if you don't own
their words,

32:57.040 --> 32:59.470
how can you sell them?

33:09.280 --> 33:10.280
Well?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.280
Well, what?

33:11.280 --> 33:13.020
Can I trust her?

33:13.020 --> 33:14.490
Trust your feelings,
Jimmy.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.250
That's the only thing
you can trust.

33:22.530 --> 33:23.800
You all right?

33:24.960 --> 33:25.960
Yeah.

33:28.700 --> 33:31.440
I don't know,
maybe I am a fraud.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.070
Isn't that what
everyone's waiting to hear?

33:34.070 --> 33:36.540
Everyone wants
to find Rebecca.

33:36.540 --> 33:38.810
I just don't think
I can really help you.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.650
Well, you already have.

33:40.650 --> 33:43.180
You saw Norval Hayes.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.650
Well, I'm always seeing things.

33:44.650 --> 33:48.850
When I was 10, I saw my parents
die in a dream, car crash.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.590
A week later,
it happened for real.

33:51.590 --> 33:52.590
I'm sorry.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.490
It's all right.

33:54.490 --> 33:55.830
You know, when I was that age,

33:55.830 --> 33:58.430
I remember seeing
this mother in a toy store.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.160
She was falling apart

34:00.170 --> 34:01.830
because she couldn't find
her child.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.340
I kept thinking about
that kid,

34:05.340 --> 34:06.770
and then about that
happening to me.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.940
About being alone
and scared

34:11.949 --> 34:14.150
and not knowing what to expect.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.380
I need you to help me
find this child.

34:21.719 --> 34:23.560
Okay.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.370
All right, the Fool.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.969
That's what I've been
telling you about.

34:37.969 --> 34:39.300
First impressions?

34:39.310 --> 34:41.909
You got to trust your instincts
over the obstacle.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.810
All right. What's next?

34:43.810 --> 34:45.409
I have to feel it.

34:54.949 --> 34:58.220
Hmm. Death.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.700
What? Everybody's got
that bad boy

35:04.700 --> 35:05.860
in their future, right?

35:08.900 --> 35:09.970

Yeah.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.690
Hmm.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.100
She's very scared.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.740
But she's safe.

36:19.770 --> 36:21.110
I'm sure of it.

This is weird.

It's like being in
the damn <i> Twilight Zone.</i>

36:52.910 --> 36:54.840
Did she play
with this a lot?

36:54.840 --> 36:56.880
Not since
she was a baby.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.380
Hmm.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.950
I can't put it down.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.750
What--
What do you see?

37:07.990 --> 37:09.790
Bright lights.

37:09.790 --> 37:10.790
Music.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.490
People.
It's a jumble.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.730
Oh.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.230
I lost it.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.170
I'll be in touch.

What, Meredith?

37:53.930 --> 37:55.900
I don't know.
It's a blur, but...

37:55.900 --> 37:58.770
it's strong.
It's so strong.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.310

There, it's not so bad.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.030

That's not so bad.

TRIVETTE:
And it keeps coming back
to horses and music.

38:35.110 --> 38:37.340
Horses and music?

38:37.340 --> 38:38.510
Do you know
what that means?

38:38.510 --> 38:40.610
No. That's just
what she keeps saying.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.150
Meredith,

38:45.150 --> 38:47.420
what do you mean
by horses and music?

38:49.890 --> 38:52.220
Dead dancing horses.

38:54.590 --> 38:56.630
the carousel.

38:56.630 --> 38:59.360
She's near the carousel.

38:59.370 --> 39:00.530
I'm sorry, Ranger,

39:00.530 --> 39:01.830
but we have to get
her out of here.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.100
Okay.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.610
Dead dancing horses.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.180
Carousel.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.620
Could she be talking
about a carnival?

39:18.620 --> 39:20.790
Yeah.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.390
There's a carnival
in the stockyard.

39:23.390 --> 39:25.690
A carousel
at Six Flags too.

39:25.690 --> 39:26.920
Okay, I'll check
Six Flags.

39:26.930 --> 39:28.590
Why don't you guys
check the stockyards?

Could've been so perfect,

40:20.750 --> 40:22.150
just you and me.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.880
No parents

Yeah, but what makes them
do what they do,

45:15.840 --> 45:17.240

Nothing. The spirits

the deck.
