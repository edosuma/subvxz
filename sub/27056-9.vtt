WEBVTT

01:34.761 --> 01:35.804
Hello, darling.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.031
Okay, bring it up.

02:53.798 --> 02:54.966
There's thousands of them.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.343
Increase the resolution.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.970
We're at maximum resolution.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.388
Well, can you bring us closer?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.242
Roy.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.662
Is this really how
you want to play this?

03:25.330 --> 03:26.956
How the fuck did you survive?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.465
Your eyes.

03:37.842 --> 03:38.885
I don't understand.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.137
My eyes were manufactured
on the ship.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.931
Part of my mother's genetics program.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.224
But the rest of you?

03:46.643 --> 03:47.769
Different.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.853
"Different"?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.357
How many lies have you told me?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.151
How many? It stops now.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.527
-I need the truth.
-Okay.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.529
I'll tell you everything,

03:59.989 --> 04:01.074
but not now.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.576
Please, Melantha.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.204
-I need you to trust me.
-No.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.624
I've had enough.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.793
I came out here
to make contact with the Volcryn.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.964
I was a fool for thinking
there was anything else.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.775
Appears to be a fleet.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.027
Not a singular ship.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.529
How many of them?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.365
We can't tell. They move too fast.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.367
I've never seen movement like this
in ships.

04:45.159 --> 04:48.246
I mean, the level of coordination
is near impossible.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.582
Mel, we need to get Thale
ready for contact.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.209
We need to reach out to them right away.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.128
I'll prep the mission lab.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.047
Sir, Lommie's requested you
in service corridor nine.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.173
Now?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.229
Lommie?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.734
You sent me a message.
Are you all right?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.113
...not.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.911
I don't understand. Do you want me
to disconnect you from the ports?

05:30.121 --> 05:33.791
Lommie isn't

05:35.251 --> 05:36.294
here.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.463
It's

05:39.297 --> 05:40.798
me,

05:42.550 --> 05:44.802
my little bear.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.482
Cynthia?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.236
Yes.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.373
For years, I swore
I could feel you inside the ship.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.378
But Roy never told me you were real.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.380
Need

06:23.216 --> 06:26.594
to stop

06:28.513 --> 06:30.765
my Nightflyer

06:31.557 --> 06:35.895
from reaching the Volcryn.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.411
Lights.

07:38.040 --> 07:38.958
Rowan.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.003
What are you doing here?

07:43.880 --> 07:47.758
You sure it was Tessia
who requested the purge?

07:49.927 --> 07:51.762
I only heard you,

07:52.972 --> 07:53.973
and Eris.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.933
Well, you were in the room.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.854
You saw the spores. They were everywhere.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.482
They were gonna kill us all.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.655
Tessia really liked you.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.328
Well, I really liked her, Rowan.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.290
She wanted you to have this.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.796
No, thank you.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.257
I really want you to have this.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.232
-What's wrong?
-I think...

08:45.066 --> 08:46.067
I think you should go.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.028
I just need some rest.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.614
You sure?

08:52.281 --> 08:55.117
The Volcryn, it's making me...

08:57.203 --> 08:58.287
Door open.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.836
You'd tell me if you recall anything?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.591
I told you everything.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.930
-She loves you.
-I know.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.548
Can I help you?

09:51.340 --> 09:54.552
My mind fragmented.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.221
Pieces missing.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.265
In the Crystal?

10:01.559 --> 10:05.146
Need to aggregate Cynthia files.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.111
I can scan the Crystal
and collect the missing pieces.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.407
Make me whole.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.785
I'm back here.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.455
Hey.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.542
We're getting closer.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.335
We can see them on the monitors.

11:51.419 --> 11:54.797
I know. It's getting louder, too.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.132
Yeah.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.508
Agatha's worried about you.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.177
When can I see her again?

12:00.803 --> 12:01.929
Um.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.099
I guess we will see.
When we get away from them.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.060
Move away from the Teke field.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603
You ain't going to be moving away.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.815
They know we're here now.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.737
You want me to reach out to them?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.409
We know they're a fleet of ships.

12:24.118 --> 12:29.039
So, you've reached through a swarm before
just like with Tessia's bees.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.419
If you can push past the voices,
see who's leading them,

12:33.502 --> 12:34.545
how many there are,

12:35.671 --> 12:36.797
what they want...

12:38.549 --> 12:40.301
That's what you got me
out here for, innit?

12:40.384 --> 12:41.719
Agatha would be proud.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.638
Yeah.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.434
No, stay on his levels.

12:48.517 --> 12:50.686
-We can pull him back if it gets too high.
-Got it.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.272
What, what exactly is it
you want me to say to them?

12:53.355 --> 12:55.357
"Hello. Do you like my tiara or what?"

12:55.441 --> 12:58.444
No. We know the Teke comes in waves.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.821
So just settle into their pattern
and listen.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.865
Remember your work
with Rowan and the rabbit.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.241
Try to focus on a voice inside...

13:04.325 --> 13:06.327
And where is Rowan?
I really need him right now.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.288
Probably down in Tessia's quarters.
He's damaged, Karl.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.498
What did I miss?

13:15.252 --> 13:16.295
Oh, well, just...

13:16.378 --> 13:19.340
Thale is about to reach out
to the Volcryn.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.841
Oh.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.510
That's exciting.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.681
Will you be sure to send down the data
to my quarters,

13:27.765 --> 13:30.017
so I can analyze the wave patterns?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.353
Sure.

13:33.938 --> 13:34.855
Thanks.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.483
Have you seen Eris?

13:39.944 --> 13:40.903
No.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.281
Me neither.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.498
Well, thank you for your service.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.001
And of course,

13:56.710 --> 13:57.753
good luck.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.424
I'm strapped in, mate.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.592
But thanks.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.893
I'll see you on the other side.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.773
Good luck, Karl.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.818
And you.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.699
Christ, I do not want to know
what's going on in that man's head.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.284
We need to keep going. Let's go.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.827
Starting monitors now.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.088
Engaging neural amplification.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.840
We're set.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.053
Whoa.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.058
Whoa, whoa.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.562
Whoa.

14:59.940 --> 15:00.983
There's a voice.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.862
It's not speaking.
It's like music.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.782
It's fucking beautiful, but it's loud.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.008
Karl, his heart. It's too much.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.551
I know.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.162
-His levels are spiking.
-No.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.372
His heart is failing.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.582
-Thale, stop. Pull out.
-No, Mel, don't touch him.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.168
-Mel!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.254
Okay, releasing the suppressives.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.812
There's nothing.

16:21.897 --> 16:22.856
He's gone.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.192
Thale.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.446
Thale.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.657
Thale!

16:40.958 --> 16:42.042
What did you see?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.086
All of it.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.464
Death, rebirth,

16:48.340 --> 16:49.508
a thousand worlds.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.177
The voices

16:52.928 --> 16:53.971
It isn't them.

16:55.472 --> 16:59.268
No, it is. We saw their ships.
There's hundreds of ships.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.352
These things.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.187
Wow.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.523
It's alive.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.860
The Volcryn.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.113
All of it, just, it's miles across.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.241
Those tiny, dancing,
shimmering little lights, you see.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.911
That's just the surface.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.831
It's endless.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.834
There's a voice.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.504
It spoke clearly.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.885
It's waiting for us.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.679
Oh, wow.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.517
Sir,

17:41.477 --> 17:43.479
you must be gratified
that we've reached the Volcryn.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.274
Yes, well, we're yet to make contact.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.780
Perhaps we should be cautious
and stop the ship here?

17:52.863 --> 17:55.783
Let the Science Team do their work
from a safe distance?

17:55.866 --> 17:58.702
We already have an established protocol
for the approach, Auggie,

17:58.786 --> 18:00.829
-you're aware of that.
-Of course,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.750
but our priority is to ensure
she doesn't sustain any damage.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.878
Why are you challenging me, Auggie?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.005
I'm not challenging you.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.761
From the beginning, my career
has been focused on the Eris legacy.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.638
You sound like my mother.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.715
How can it be alive out here
in the middle of nothing?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.009
No sunlight. No nutrients.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.554
What is it? Some form of biomass or...

19:01.056 --> 19:02.307
I don't think it's hostile.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.893
It just can't be known.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.896
What it's done, sending the probe
back to us, bringing my memory to life...

19:07.980 --> 19:10.274
Now, it's trying to talk to us.
It's trying to talk to me.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.943
What you're reading as communication
could be a form of an attack.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.239
Karl, we came out here
to help our planet,

19:17.322 --> 19:19.366
not to relive memories
from our personal lives.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.243
Look how powerful it made Thale

19:21.326 --> 19:22.494
and Agatha.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.414
Now, we don't know
how much Teke that contains,

19:25.497 --> 19:27.166
what it can do,
what it can be utilized for.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.542
Unless it kills us first.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.172
Look, I know this mission's
been really hard,

19:34.089 --> 19:37.926
but none of this would be possible
without our team.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.429
You made this possible, Mel.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.347
You did.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.999
Stop! Stop. Stop.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.431
Fuck!

20:42.199 --> 20:44.201
Thale, stop!

20:46.954 --> 20:48.288
-Argh.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.223
How are you here?

21:06.807 --> 21:08.475
Push yourself out of your body.

21:32.958 --> 21:33.917
I made contact.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.044
I felt them.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.674
I miss you being here with me.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.138
Do you remember
when we were at Sutherland?

21:47.014 --> 21:50.809
How they had to separate the Ls
because the feedback got so strong?

21:51.727 --> 21:52.686
Yeah.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.941
I mean, just stay on opposite sides
of the ship.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.487
The closer we get to the Volcryn,
the stronger it gets.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.698
It could kill us.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.578
We need to cut the loop.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.829
No.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.291
I can't let you do that.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.835
We ain't got a fucking choice.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.006
Either one of us dies or we both do.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.426
Watch out.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.102
You're doing what you came here to do.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.857
You're becoming something new.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.943
I don't want to be something new.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.655
You have to trust me.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.701
Don't be afraid.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.034
We're gaining on them.

23:33.995 --> 23:34.913
There it is.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.833
Track the velocity of
the Volcryn, find out why

23:37.916 --> 23:39.167
we're closing on them so fast.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.418
It's because it stopped.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.295
It's waiting for us.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.507
She's right, sir. Forward progress
to the Volcryn has ceased.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.843
Thale reached out to it.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.345
He believes it knows we're coming.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.805
I believe it wants to make contact.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.933
It's initiating this behavior.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.434
Or it wants to kill us.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.187
There's only one chance to find out.
We have to keep going.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.313
Karl.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.315
We have a plan.
We worked on this for over a year.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.110
Mel. Mel, things have changed.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.737
We are too close now
to worry about protocol.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.739
You're not thinking clearly, Karl.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.410
This isn't about Skye. This is bigger.

24:13.493 --> 24:14.703
It's about all of us.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.124
The Nightflyer needs
to match Volcryn behavior.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.377
If that is a sentient being,
then we should approach it cautiously,

24:22.460 --> 24:25.213
-not showing any signs of aggression.
-It's waiting for us!

24:25.297 --> 24:27.257
If we stop and it decides to move away...

24:27.340 --> 24:30.010
-Need to move forward. Full throttle.
-The Volcryn might perceive that

24:30.093 --> 24:32.637
-as predatory behavior.
-No.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.973
We keep going until point of contact.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.474
You're playing with our lives.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.396
We can't afford to lose
this opportunity, Mel.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.318
Maintain course speed of 50 percent.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.360
Yes, sir.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.657
You may have just killed us all.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.563
We need to stop my son.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.776
Use the Terraform Dome.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.736
It's Roy's favorite.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.239
Agatha, I can't believe this.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.699
This is finally happening.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.868
Everything's just changing so fast.
It's...

26:59.951 --> 27:01.870
-I know.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.079
I spoke to Thale.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.622
Yeah

27:05.248 --> 27:06.207
He's in pain.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.168
Worse than me.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.754
Yeah, but he's been doing amazing things.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.922
It's incredible, your guidance,

27:13.006 --> 27:15.675
-everything you've taught him.
-There's going to be more damage, Karl.

27:16.343 --> 27:19.054
-People you love.
-We knew the risks involved.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.639
This is an incredibly dangerous mission,
is it not?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.184
Is it worth it?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.563
Yeah.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.023
-Agatha.
-Don't.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.192
It's not safe.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.819
Agatha,

27:34.903 --> 27:36.529
look at how powerful you've become.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.031
And Thale, look...

27:38.114 --> 27:40.700
Think of what we can do for the planet
with all of this power.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.870
Think about what you had, Karl.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.040
Think about what you have.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.167
I have proof.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.044
I have contact.

27:51.127 --> 27:53.213
I have the team. I have Thale...

27:54.756 --> 27:55.882
I have you.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.487
How?

28:18.655 --> 28:20.031
Channeling the Teke.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.993
You're so beautiful.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.668
I love you, Karl.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.258
Remember this.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.358
Finish what you came here to do.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.040
It's so beautiful.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.960
Are you okay?

29:14.878 --> 29:15.920
Huh?

29:16.546 --> 29:17.630
We have to move faster.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.091
What?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.385
Continue forward progression, Auggie.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.637
Thrusters up, 20 percent.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.930
Yes, sir.

29:26.848 --> 29:27.849
Thank you, Roy.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.650
There's something wrong
with the Terraform.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.943
Critical error.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.196
Emergency.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.489
Critical error.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.282
-What?
-Emergency.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.867
-Emergency.
-The dome's gonna blow.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.535
Critical error.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.370
Emergency.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.538
Emergency.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.250
Emergency.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.585
Emergency.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.961
Emergency.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.838
Level four alert.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.759
The captain is aware of a situation
and will have updates momentarily.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.552
Please proceed to your cabin.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.181
Which level?

30:12.393 --> 30:13.478
Um.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.981
Six.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.733
Oh, me too.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.321
Bonsoir.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.701
Stop the ring. Stop the ring!

31:09.784 --> 31:10.827
All my data.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.287
-Agatha.
-Out of balance.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.289
-Karl, no! It's too dangerous.
-Just fix it.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.457
Get our pressure systems
under control, now.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.008
We need to take the dome offline.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.677
Move!

31:53.828 --> 31:55.038
Brace for collision.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.211
Hold on!

32:56.516 --> 33:00.061
This is Dr. Agatha Matheson
of the Nightflyer.

33:00.144 --> 33:04.273
We have sustained fatalities,
structural damages.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.274
We...

34:21.976 --> 34:23.019
This is a warning.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.189
Not a distress call.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.442
Do not board this ship.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.155
Do not bring the Nightflyer back to Earth.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.702
Me again.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.417
-No.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.348
No!

35:51.983 --> 35:53.651
Argh! Fuck!

37:04.388 --> 37:06.182
You're free now, Thale.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.308
I love you.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.731
No, no, no.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.214
Get out of the way!

37:43.594 --> 37:46.472
Willa, we need to
temporarily shut down the compressors.

37:47.723 --> 37:48.766
I'm trying.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.101
The consoles are malfunctioning.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.727
-Go down and do it manually.
-Yes, sir.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.853
Let's move.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.199
Woops.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.003
Eris!

38:20.923 --> 38:22.383
Eris!

38:24.427 --> 38:26.554
Reroute the pressure lines.
Send it back to the ring.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.930
-Yes, sir.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.149
"Initiate decontamination sequence."

38:52.455 --> 38:53.956
What the fuck are you?

39:05.676 --> 39:06.844
This is for Tessia.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.475
Emergency!

39:12.558 --> 39:14.643
Please.

39:29.408 --> 39:32.161
-Why won't you fucking die?
-Rowan!

39:32.244 --> 39:33.746
-Fucking die!
-Rowan!

39:33.829 --> 39:35.206
Die!

39:35.873 --> 39:37.208
-Fucking die!
-Rowan!

39:40.252 --> 39:41.087
Rowan.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.845
No. I'm not the problem.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.180
I'm not the problem.

39:51.263 --> 39:52.556
He's the problem.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.641
No, I...

39:53.724 --> 39:55.476
He's the problem. Have a look.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.460
You did it, Auggie.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.382
My little bear.

40:42.815 --> 40:43.732
Karl,

40:44.775 --> 40:46.777
I know this will be hard to understand.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.624
The pain of what's happening to me,

41:02.209 --> 41:03.627
the feedback from Thale,

41:04.920 --> 41:08.841
we are endangering the ship
and everyone aboard.

41:08.924 --> 41:11.552
I love you more than you will ever know

41:11.635 --> 41:13.637
and I know that you love me.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.390
I've seen it.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.309
I felt it.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.104
But my presence on the Nightflyer
will kill you.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.024
I have to break the loop.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.194
I'm sorry.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.906
I'm so sorry.
