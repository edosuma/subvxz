They'll give you
new names, money.

48:16.603 --> 48:18.730
You'll be secure.
That's all that matters.

48:18.771 --> 48:19.856
What about the house?

48:21.399 --> 48:22.859
The grapevines?

48:22.900 --> 48:24.777
The orange trees?

48:24.819 --> 48:26.237
What was that?

48:26.279 --> 48:28.406
Please don't.

48:28.448 --> 48:30.408
I want that more than anything.

48:30.450 --> 48:32.160
- Oh, you do?
- But it's not that easy.

48:33.786 --> 48:35.288
There are things
that have happened to me.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.624
Things I have done.

48:37.665 --> 48:39.167
And I have to begin again

48:39.208 --> 48:42.211
in a place where people
know nothing about me.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.589
You understand?

48:44.631 --> 48:45.965
You want to forget about me?

48:46.007 --> 48:47.592
Maybe I have to.

48:47.634 --> 48:50.094
For a while.

48:51.137 --> 48:52.555
Well, maybe one day,

48:52.597 --> 48:56.100
you'll have escaped enough
to come back.

48:56.142 --> 48:58.686
I hope so, more than anything.

48:58.728 --> 49:00.730
I hope so, too.

49:09.322 --> 49:10.698
I have to go.

49:10.740 --> 49:13.034
Don't forget
your passport, Grace.
