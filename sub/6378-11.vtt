WEBVTT

00:13.430 --> 00:14.715
Is this a bad time?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.012
A bad time?

00:20.187 --> 00:22.052
There's no such thing as bad.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.190
Or time, for that matter.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.559
Wanna join me?

02:03.498 --> 02:06.035
-Get up!
-No!

02:08.211 --> 02:09.291
Have you lost your mind?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.546
Didn't you hear all those nasty things
she said about you? And me.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.709
She's my mama. She gets to.
The hell are you from?

02:17.429 --> 02:18.635
-Mama?
-|'m sorry.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.846
Mama, you all right?

02:22.017 --> 02:24.884
Oh, yeah.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.682
Hoyt?

02:30.734 --> 02:34.067
Yeah, I should have listened to Vampire Bill
when he warned me about you.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.982
Now, come on. Come on, Mama.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.606
Do we have to?

02:39.785 --> 02:44.700
-I think I actually enjoyed that.
-Do you see what you did to her?

02:46.541 --> 02:48.918
Come on.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.902
What gives you the right to say no
to the femoral blood of a good woman?

03:21.076 --> 03:23.067
You know what your problem is,
William?

03:23.245 --> 03:25.611
You are a snob.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.616
I hate snobs.

03:27.791 --> 03:33.252
Tiny, tiny souls, or penises, or both.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.620
Get out.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.550
-Have you eaten?
-Not tonight, but--

03:47.853 --> 03:49.434
Has to be tasted to be believed.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.595
Not polluted like most humans.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.936
Tastes exactly the way they used
to taste just after I was turned.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.318
Before the Industrial Revolution
fucked everything to hell.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.479
-Should I summon him?
-No, thank you.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.945
There are pressing matters at hand
I need your help with.

04:04.119 --> 04:07.111
I need to know how to kill a maenad.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.662
A maenad?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.119
In Bon Temps? That's random.

04:12.294 --> 04:16.253
Yes. She seems to have caused
some sort of mass hypnosis.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.631
The whole town has devolved
to a primitive state in a matter of days.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.917
Oh, my, she's an old one.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.837
Well, they're all old. Relics.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.221
Ancient Greece, correct?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.631
Before that even.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.346
-Orgies, sacrifice?
-Yes.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.932
-Cannibalism?
-We suspect.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.518
Oh, fun.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.359
So how do I kill it?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.235
You can't.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.988
She's convinced herself
she's immortal, and so she is.

04:47.537 --> 04:52.122
William, surely you know that everything
that exists imagined itself into existence.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.996
I'm not entirely familiar
with that theory, no.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.798
Think about it.

04:58.965 --> 05:03.129
You're a wild young girl who's married
to some jerk who treats you like property...

05:03.303 --> 05:05.294
...and is also fucking
some 14-year-old boy.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.723
And along comes this religion
which encourages you to get hammered...

05:09.893 --> 05:14.432
...run naked through the woods,
have sex with whoever, whatever...

05:14.606 --> 05:17.564
...and it's all part of getting closer to God.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.891
I could see how that would have appeal...

05:20.070 --> 05:23.153
...especially to humans
with their tendency towards Puritanism.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.824
Exactly.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.277
So you're fucking everybody in the dirt...

05:27.452 --> 05:30.194
...why not kill something and eat it raw?

05:30.372 --> 05:33.614
Hey, you're super extra pious,
there's nothing you can't do.

05:33.792 --> 05:37.535
And each time you do it just brings you
one step closer to the divine.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.707
Isn't that delusional?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.918
Never underestimate
the power of blind faith.

05:43.093 --> 05:48.759
It can manifest in ways that bend
the laws of physics, or break them entirely.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.389
I bit her, and it poisoned me.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.266
Of course it did.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.519
We can only drink human blood.
She's no longer even remotely human.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.351
But she started out as human.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.062
Hello. Evolution?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.897
We started out that way too.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.863
Less than two hours till dawn.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.617
Shall we have sex?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.243
Kidding.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.748
I haven't enjoyed sex with men
since the Eisenhower administration.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.256
-I really ought to get back to--
-Nonsense.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.088
Sookie's not in any trouble.
You would know it.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.879
-But |--
-Spend the day and leave tomorrow night.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.299
-I really would lo--
-I insist.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.441
By the way, you haven't told me
what you think of my new day room.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.572
It's lovely.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.325
Tara, stop pacing.
You need to get some sleep.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.781
We have to go get him.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.333
And we will as soon as Bill gets back.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.116
He might have information
about how to deal with Maryann.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.581
He might have some information?
He might not.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.496
And Eggs needs to get out now.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.414
Tara, it's just too dangerous.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.801
How many times have you put yourself
in danger for the man you love?

07:09.971 --> 07:14.806
-How come you get that option and I don't?
-Baby girl, it's better this way.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.347
Oh, shit, she coming for you.

07:19.147 --> 07:23.356
I finally found a strong, beautiful,
good man who loves me...

07:23.526 --> 07:26.359
...and y'all keeping me from
rescuing him because I might get hurt?

07:26.529 --> 07:30.021
How hurt do you think I'm gonna be
if we wait and something happens to him?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.486
I ain't letting you go
to somebody who beats you.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.118
-He beat her?
-No, it wasn't him.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.949
It was Maryann. Her influence.

07:37.123 --> 07:42.868
She didn't throw the punches, did she? No.
Now sit down and shut the fuck up.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.628
-Sookie, my back pocket, get them handcuffs.
-No.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.044
These are fur.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.928
Give me your hand.
Give me your goddamn hand.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.305
I will never forgive you for this. Never.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.349
You're just jealous because I found love...

07:58.520 --> 08:01.978
...and you know you never will,
you fucking freak.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.809
Baby, it's for you own good.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.896
You too. You don't want me to be happy
because you never were.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.401
| only want you to be happy.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.857
And you had to settle for a dead man.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.365
That's supposed to get me on your side?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.912
I'm going on the porch,
make sure that woman don't come.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.163
You think she will?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.416
If it's supernatural and it wants you...

08:23.586 --> 08:26.419
...it ain't gonna wait
for you to come to it.

08:41.813 --> 08:45.055
You are kidding me.
This ain't happening to you.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.857
Seriously?
You can become any animal anytime?

08:53.074 --> 08:56.362
Yeah, as long as I've imprinted on it.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.278
That is fucking cool, man.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.789
Yeah, well, as cool as that may be...

09:02.959 --> 09:06.042
...we got a maenad we gotta deal with
before it takes our town out.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.624
Listen, you can't deal with it.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.881
All right, your best bet's
to leave while you still can.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.293
Shouldn't we think about
getting the law involved?

09:14.471 --> 09:15.802
I am involved.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.885
Well, I meant Sheriff Dearborne, Kenya
that other guy, the squirrelly one.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.971
Sheriff's station
was wide open and empty.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.602
They ain't gonna help.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.483
Then we have got to be the law.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.311
Guys, I read a book about this.
This is Armageddon.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.323
This is the
Oral History of the Zombie War.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.817
We need weapons, lots of them.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.659
Listen, I hate to break it to, but guns
aren't gonna do jack shit to Maryann.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.949
And you can't shoot anybody else.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.745
All right, these are our friends.
This is our town.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.665
Well, sometimes you need
to destroy something to save it.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.302
That's in the Bible.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.303
Or the Constitution.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.339
Is she in there?

10:13.863 --> 10:15.899
Who's out there?

10:22.413 --> 10:24.790
No need to be afraid.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.455
Just come on out
so we can see each other.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.594
Coby?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.228
-Hey. Hey.
-Is our mama here?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.889
No, no. Not right now.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.729
-Good. Will you help us hide?
-Yeah.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.439
And will you make us lunch?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.524
We haven't eaten since before yesterday.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.065
Sam.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.483
Andy and I are taking off.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.401
-Where you going?
-Sheriff's office.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.741
We gotta arm ourselves.
Hey, Coby, Lisa.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.871
Jason, no. You-- You--

11:08.042 --> 11:11.375
You're walking into something
more dangerous than you can even imagine.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.003
Sam, I gotta do this.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.756
Well, you're gonna get yourself killed.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.918
Probably a lot of other people as well.
Just think this through.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.633
Time for thinking is over.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.468
It's time for action.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.224
Well, maybe Sam's right.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.058
Has he been to Leadership Conference?

11:32.233 --> 11:34.610
Has he had paramilitary training?

11:34.777 --> 11:37.268
You're a damn fool, Jason.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.527
Come on.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.280
Let's go inside, get you kids
something to eat. Come on.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.817
You're a damn fool, Jason.

11:45.663 --> 11:49.155
By the way, you're welcome
for me saving your life.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.837
Can you believe that?
What an asshole.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.714
Welcome to my world, Jason.

12:15.235 --> 12:19.148
-Don't you at least want to sit down?
-Nope.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.198
It's a text from Bill.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.830
From five hours ago. Damn it.
I'm getting a phone as soon as Eric pays me.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.286
You're working for Eric?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.796
Great.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.330
Bill's not coming back until tomorrow.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.592
Well, then I guess we better not
plan on him saving us.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.504
Mama, you gotta let me go.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.174
You keep me here
and anything happens to Eggs...

12:49.352 --> 12:51.843
...you will have destroyed
my one chance at true love.

12:52.021 --> 12:55.809
Girl, you don't want true love.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.818
True love will rip you open.
It'll tear you up.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.819
I will forgive you.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.363
For everything.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.614
Everything.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.446
You know that is a lot.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.201
And this is a one-time-only offer.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.533
I can't, baby. I can't.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.701
-If you don't, God will judge you.
-|t's God telling me not to.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.539
It is Satan.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.456
That's Satan in your
motherfucking Sunday hat.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.545
Satan has been telling you
he is God for a long time.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.883
-You've fallen for it hook, line, and sinker.
-That ain't true.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.638
Yes, it is.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.471
I see it in your eyes...

13:32.645 --> 13:35.512
...and it's looking right back at me.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.727
Like it has ever since I was born.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.734
God, you've never been
a real woman of God.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.730
You never stepped outside
your own ignorance and fear...

13:45.908 --> 13:50.572
...and done something selfless,
for me or for anybody.

13:50.747 --> 13:55.867
Well, God is knocking
on your door right now, Mama.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.911
It couldn't be more loud and clear.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.874
Are you gonna let him in?

14:14.771 --> 14:18.013
Lord God, I take refuge in you.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.933
Save and deliver me
from all those who pursue me...

14:21.110 --> 14:24.022
...or they will tear at me like a lion
and rip me to pieces...

14:24.197 --> 14:26.483
...and there will be no one to rescue me.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.194
What was it like inside Tara '3 head?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.616
Like there was no limit.

14:33.790 --> 14:39.626
Like anything could happen
and it probably will.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.459
And you can feel
your insides expanding...

14:43.633 --> 14:46.966
...but there's also this--

14:47.136 --> 14:53.257
This emptying out of everything
right at the very center of your being...

14:53.434 --> 14:56.301
...and you don't want that to ever stop.

14:56.479 --> 14:57.514
Ever.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.181
Damn, that sound nice.

15:04.278 --> 15:08.317
Here you go.
There's more where that came from.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.065
What's wrong with our mama?

15:13.287 --> 15:15.152
I'm not sure.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.571
But I think she's sick.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.240
Is she blind?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.911
Well, she might be sometimes,
but not always.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.329
Is she gonna die?

15:24.507 --> 15:28.546
No. Not anytime soon.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.801
Now listen, has she....

15:30.972 --> 15:34.180
Has she been sick in front of you a lot?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.341
She doesn't seem sick.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.261
She seems crazy.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.770
Is she crazy?

15:41.566 --> 15:44.478
Everybody gets a little crazy
every now and then.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.984
She's always kissing Terry...

15:47.155 --> 15:50.192
...and doing other gross stuff
when her eyes get weird.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.526
Can we get her a doctor?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.529
Or someone to make her
like she used to be?

15:55.371 --> 15:56.781
-Wel|--
-Like a vampire.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.698
-A vampire would know what to do.
-Where's Vampire Bill?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.372
I don't know. I think he's--
He's still in Dallas.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.502
Don't you know any other vampires?

16:10.386 --> 16:12.377
How's your leg?

16:12.555 --> 16:16.173
-Better than ever.
-How'd that happen?

16:17.059 --> 16:21.223
Eric made me drink his motherfucking blood
is how that happened.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.978
Me too. He tricked me.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.856
-Somebody need to slap that bitch.
-Ihave.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.517
Look at you.

16:29.238 --> 16:35.450
Have you had any dreams about him?

16:36.454 --> 16:39.742
-Now, Sook, how would you know that?
-What kind of dreams?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.576
It's like he's always in my head.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.087
And sex dreams, all kind of nasty and...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.172
...fantastic.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.083
Which freaks me the fuck out.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.923
I hates that motherfucker
more than you'll ever know.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.178
Oh, hell. What now?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.763
What?

17:01.938 --> 17:05.396
I can't stay in there with her,
saying those things that break my heart.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.433
I will keep guard
while one of you goes to sit with her.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.523
-She can't hurt you like she's hurting me.
-Oh, yes, she can.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.860
-You ain't gonna shoot yourself, is you?
-Show me some respect, boy.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.027
I taught you how to shoot when those
white boys was giving you trouble.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.039
Yeah, but, auntie, that was a BB gun
you used to shoot cats with.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.415
You shot cats?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.450
When they went to the bathroom
in my yard.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.293
All right, now.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.551
-What you doing?
-Tara, baby, I got the gun.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.262
-Oh, you are not doing this.
-Go unlock her handcuffs.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.813
. . .f.
”,5!

17:48.317 --> 17:50.979
Miss Thornton, Lafayette
was recently shot. He's been--

17:51.153 --> 17:54.486
-You go unlock Tara.
-So she can go back to Maryann?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.648
You've seen what it's like in there. Evil.

17:56.826 --> 18:01.616
-You're sending Tara back into it?
-I got a chance to win my baby back for real.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.575
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.001
-Keys?
-|t's in my pocket.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.672
But I can't move.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.679
I pity you.

18:26.188 --> 18:29.772
I don't hate you like your mama does.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.103
You can't help what you are.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.862
But I cannot let you
keep me and Tara apart.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.156
That's why I'm gonna have to kill you.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.036
Oh, Jesus.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.205
Thought you wanted
to be a vampire.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.296
You know how you feel
with my blood inside you?

19:00.681 --> 19:03.798
Well, being a vampire is like that...

19:05.561 --> 19:07.392
...times a million.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.356
Goodbye, sweetheart.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.732
-What the hell did you do to him?
-Nothing.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.237
Tara, baby, go.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.995
And don't you ever forget
I did this for you!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.501
Sookie. I need your keys.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.081
You are being a fucking idiot.

19:48.145 --> 19:52.730
Hey, you think Sam's ever turned into a dog
and then had sex with a lady dog?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.858
Jesus,Jason,
you're talking about bestiality.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.440
It ain't bestiality
if there ain't a human involved.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.276
Then it's just nature.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.190
Sure don't seem like nature to me.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.234
What the fuck?

20:08.249 --> 20:11.491
That was Everlee Mason.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.125
We gotta fix things, Andy.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.786
I ain't letting weird shit like this
take over my town.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.378
No fucking way.

20:21.095 --> 20:24.804
Really? You dialed 911
and you got me?

20:24.974 --> 20:28.057
Oh, honey, you are fucked.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.681
Gotta go. Good luck.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.473
Well, hey there, Detective Bellefleur.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.152
I missed you.

20:37.862 --> 20:40.854
Don't you remember me?
We almost had sex once.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.152
Hey, Jason.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.817
Hey, Rosie.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.329
How would you like to get fucked
every which way but north?

20:50.499 --> 20:54.663
-Hey.
-|t's okay, Andy. I got this.

20:54.837 --> 20:56.247
You just go get the heat.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.788
Stackhouse. This is a serious operation.

20:58.966 --> 21:04.177
-It ain't about you getting your pole wet.
-Dude, do not cockblock me.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.389
It'll keep her from telling
anyone else we're here. Now go.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.683
I'm gonna turn you inside out, boy.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.520
That sounds like it's gonna hurt.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.702
Jackpot

21:43.761 --> 21:46.002
Hey, Andy. Come dance with me.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.260
Come on.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.143
Damn it, Bud.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.815
You know I hate to dance.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.904
-Hey.
-Cut it out!

22:07.451 --> 22:09.737
I gotta take a dump.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.749
Why he keep shaking like that?

22:21.924 --> 22:24.711
-Because he is traumatized.
-Well, so am I.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.547
I'm gonna do something
and I need you to move fast.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.054
Grab the gun when she drops it.
Can you do that?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.929
It's all right.
She ain't gonna shoot you.

22:37.273 --> 22:41.141
Would you please at least
lower that gun, Miss Thornton?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.229
He is freaking out.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.284
Come on! Let's go get Tara.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.076
It's not my fault!

22:56.250 --> 22:59.242
She begged me to let her go!

22:59.420 --> 23:02.503
Said she'd forgive me!

23:08.470 --> 23:11.928
Sam, did you know my daddy?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.385
I did not.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.725
Your mom, well, she split up with him
before I came to town.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.814
I heard about him, though.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.021
What did you hear?

23:25.779 --> 23:29.818
That he was a bit of a wild card...

23:31.577 --> 23:33.818
...with a big personality.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.282
I don't even know what he looks like.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.615
Mama cut him out
of all the pictures she had.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.911
All I know is his name's Duane, and he
tattooed Mama's name on his stomach.

23:44.506 --> 23:48.670
Well, he must have loved her a lot,
because you know that hurt.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.181
Excuse me.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.315
Oh, no. No, no.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.898
Nothing to be afraid of.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.438
Just here to see Eric.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.197
He won't be here till after dark.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.817
Well, obviously.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.280
I have two kids with me.

24:16.455 --> 24:20.619
-Can we wait inside?
-No. I can't let anyone in without permission.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.371
Not even for...

24:27.216 --> 24:28.956
...a hundred dollars?

24:41.730 --> 24:45.723
I can hold that for you if you like.
Might make it a little easier for you to drive.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.438
Ain't nobody
gonna point this pistol but me.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.819
Ain't nothing personal.

24:53.951 --> 24:57.694
-Are you okay?
-Nope.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.782
Lafayette, I need you to suck it up.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.573
-I cannot do this alone.
-I know.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.208
We need to get in,
get Tara and get the hell out.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.085
Yep.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.043
And if Maryann gives us trouble,
shoot her.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.008
-I will.
-I mean it.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.258
Shoot her in the head.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.401
Eggs?

25:37.578 --> 25:38.943
Baby.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.453
Where you been? I was so scared.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.488
Don't you ever leave me again, okay?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.124
I won't. I promise.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.286
I love you.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.797
We gotta get you out of here, okay?
Let's go somewhere else, please.

25:51.967 --> 25:57.303
-Listen to me.
-But everything you want is right here.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.299
-I knew you'd come.
-No.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.891
-I don't know what you are, but I want out.
-No, it's too late for that.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.646
You made me eat somebody's heart.

26:07.816 --> 26:12.105
And you loved it. Admit it.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.646
You don't want us. You want Sam.
We ain't got nothing to do with it.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.611
Nothing to do with it?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.786
You summoned me.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.534
What?

26:24.708 --> 26:27.996
That night in the woods
with that unfortunate pharmacist.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.661
You saw me.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.005
Well, you saw you through me.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.178
Oh, Mama, please. Don't hurt me.

26:39.348 --> 26:40.679
One of you must die.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.516
But Miss Jeanette was a fake.

26:44.686 --> 26:48.349
She scammed people
by making up crazy rituals.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.307
Ritual is a powerful thing.

26:52.486 --> 26:55.694
And calling forth that kind of energy...

26:56.949 --> 26:58.530
...has COHSGQUGI‘ICGS.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.693
So she was real.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.994
Sadly, no.

27:05.165 --> 27:08.657
I should have known she wasn't the vessel,
but you have to try every option.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.327
Please, just let us go.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.671
That doesn't work on me anymore.

27:36.113 --> 27:39.480
That's more like it.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.499
-Maryann.
-Maryann.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.417
Hey! Hey. Get over. Hey.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.877
He came.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.800
-What?
-The God Who Comes.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.006
He came.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.843
Yeah, and he smoked
old Sam Merlotte but good.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.600
What are you talking about?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.393
He had horns.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.649
And he took Sam Merlotte
and he smote him.

28:15.819 --> 28:20.188
And then Sam disappeared.
Just boom. Gone.

28:20.365 --> 28:26.452
And then-- And Sam's clothes
just fell to the ground. Empty.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.910
You fucking morons!

28:37.758 --> 28:39.874
Out! Get out!

28:44.973 --> 28:48.966
Must I do everything myself?

28:52.189 --> 28:56.023
You ain't got nothing like
grenades, flamethrowers?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.933
I'll tell you.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.898
If you let me blow you.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.657
Rosie, I ain't never taken advantage
of someone while she was fucked up.

29:04.826 --> 29:08.990
What a liar. I know for a fact that Patsy Lyle
passed out in the middle of sex with you.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.950
She was fine when it started.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.658
Come on.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.826
I'm real good at it.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.084
I just wouldn't feel right
about it, darling.

29:20.259 --> 29:24.878
-Would you feel right about it now?
-Shoot him.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.296
-I wanna see what happens to his head.
-No.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.011
What's the game
with the one bullet in the gun...

29:30.185 --> 29:32.927
...and you don't know
if it'll go off or not?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.061
That Chinese fire drill?

29:35.232 --> 29:38.395
-Russian roulette.
-Yeah, that's it.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.521
Kevin, drop it.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.488
Stupid fucker!

29:45.659 --> 29:48.025
Jason. It's okay.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.536
Kevlar.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.991
Cool. You get one for me?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.373
Only got the one.

29:59.548 --> 30:02.039
Well, that sucks.

30:04.845 --> 30:08.337
You know how big this match is. Not
only are both of these men champions...

30:08.515 --> 30:10.847
...of their respective brand,
I mean, you know....

30:11.018 --> 30:14.931
Damn. I should have frozen
these Snickers bars first.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.017
What the hell.
It's all gonna melt when I cook it.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.852
Maybe I'll freeze it then.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.530
-Mama, what the heck are you doing?
-Hot sauce.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.161
Oh, God.
Nobody's gonna eat that.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.370
He will. And he is gonna love it.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.290
-We have to hurry.
-No, we ain't going nowhere.

30:40.464 --> 30:45.003
Maryann will remember this day
for the rest of her life.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.544
I don't have the heart to tell her
it's all downhill from here.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.509
-What are you talking about?
-There ain't a woman alive...

30:51.683 --> 30:54.425
...who'd go through with it
if she knew the truth.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.265
Oh, Hoyt, you can go ahead
and pack that box of chardonnay.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.395
Mama, we ain't going.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.228
You are not keeping me from this.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.939
When Daddy died,
I promised I would take care of you.

31:05.113 --> 31:09.026
-You were 10. Let it go.
-|'ve already let too much bad happen to you.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.285
You haven't let
enough bad happen to me.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.947
You know how many times
I wanted to go down to Merlotte's...

31:17.125 --> 31:23.746
...and drink myself silly and find
some dumb redneck to take to my bed?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.289
Butno.

31:25.467 --> 31:29.176
I had to take care of you.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.711
You ain't yourself right now.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.971
Lordy, boy...

31:33.141 --> 31:36.599
...you are every bit
as big a pansy as your daddy.

31:36.770 --> 31:37.976
Daddy was a hero.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.434
Daddy was a secret drinker.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.974
And you wanna know what I really think?

31:44.486 --> 31:47.774
A closet homosexual.

31:47.948 --> 31:51.486
That man just liked to dance
more than a normal man should.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.743
You know, I don't wanna hear this.
It's just mean.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.120
Daddy died protecting me and you
from a burglar.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.661
Daddy put a bullet in his own head.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.248
He was too weak
to handle his responsibilities.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.209
But--

32:07.384 --> 32:10.091
I lied and said it was a burglar.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.800
Otherwise we'd have never gotten
that life insurance money, dumb ass.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.812
My Gran lived and died in that house...

32:30.365 --> 32:35.701
...and now it's like people who are the exact
opposite of everything she was are--

32:35.871 --> 32:38.954
Oh yeah, baby! Good.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.536
--defiling her.

32:44.629 --> 32:50.716
I almost got raped in Dallas,
but this is so much worse.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.218
Don't take it personal, Sook.

32:53.388 --> 32:56.630
They ain't themselves,
and they not doing it on purpose.

32:56.808 --> 33:00.926
The first time I met Maryann I knew
there was something seriously off about her.

33:01.104 --> 33:04.392
She was thinking creepy foreign stuff,
and I could tell it wasn't good.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.978
I mean, you couldn't have stopped her.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.566
How come there's so much
wrong in the world, Lafayette?

33:14.493 --> 33:20.910
How come so many people are willing
to do bad things and hurt other people?

33:22.375 --> 33:24.161
Because they're weak.

33:24.336 --> 33:28.079
Well, I am not weak,
and I am not afraid.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.123
I am gonna kick that bitch's evil ass
out of my Gran's house.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.713
-Then you are gonna shoot her.
-In the fucking head.

33:33.887 --> 33:36.720
-Right.
-Hey. Y'all are trespassing.

33:36.890 --> 33:40.929
-You're gonna have to pay a fine.
-Yeah. Or go to the brig.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.767
The fine is a hundred million dollars
and your pants.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.933
-|'|| take that gun.
-Hey, how about drugs?

33:49.110 --> 33:51.647
-Would you take some drugs?
-No. I do not take drugs.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.278
-What do you got?
-MDMA. Pharmaceutical grade.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.940
-You ain't got no oxy?
-Drugs are for losers, baby.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.576
It'll make sex real nice.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.783
Oh, okay. Give me.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.698
-How much you want?
-All of them.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.868
Yeah. Because if ajob
ain't worth doing all out...

34:13.009 --> 34:15.091
I don't wanna wait.
I'm gonna go in the back.

34:15.262 --> 34:18.129
Right behind you soon as I get done
with these bug-eyed freaks.

34:19.015 --> 34:20.801
I got a yellow one.

34:20.976 --> 34:22.967
Here, chickie chickie.

34:23.144 --> 34:24.475
Here, chickie chickie.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.317
Why should I help you, shifter?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.819
Because I need your help.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.821
We need it.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.826
And hopefully someday I might be able
to give you something you need.

34:40.996 --> 34:44.830
-Can you give me Sookie Stackhouse?
-No.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.490
Well, that's a shame.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.080
That would be a tribute
I would not soon forget.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.085
I'm not here to give you tribute, Eric.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.542
No, you're here to request my help...

34:53.717 --> 34:56.834
...based on a hypothetical future
in which you return the favor.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.309
But you are known to not be friendly
toward those like me.

35:06.479 --> 35:07.685
Why should I trust you?

35:07.856 --> 35:11.144
Because until somebody
starts trusting somebody...

35:11.318 --> 35:14.981
...we're all single targets,
just ripe for the picking.

35:16.323 --> 35:19.656
I have no knowledge
of this maenad creature.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.989
I suspect it's the bullheaded beast
that passed through recently.

35:23.163 --> 35:25.495
-Right, Pam?
-That thing owes me a pair of shoes.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.705
So can you help us or not?

35:27.876 --> 35:31.744
I do know someone who might
be able to offer something useful.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.537
Might be able to.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.047
Can we see your fangs?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.630
-Don't you like vampires, little girl?
-Eric.

35:45.602 --> 35:51.222
Our almost stepdaddy hated vampires,
but we don't.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.481
He went on a vacation with Jesus.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.064
You make me so happy
I never had any of you.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.523
Oh, come on, Pam. They're funny.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.075
They're like humans but miniature.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.074
Teacup humans.

36:03.411 --> 36:04.321
I hate them.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.411
They're so stupid.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.200
But delicious.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.242
So can you call this other person
who might be able to...?

36:11.419 --> 36:14.081
Better yet, I'll go see her.

36:15.090 --> 36:16.705
But I must leave right away.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.677
No problem. I'll walk you out.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.302
Please get those horrible things
out of here.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.843
I'll be smelling them for a week.

36:28.269 --> 36:29.429
You have my phone number.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.604
I'll let you know if! learn
anything of use to you.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.730
Good night, tiny humans.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.199
He can fly.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.946
Come on. Come on, Coby.
Let's get you two back to Bon Temps.

36:49.124 --> 36:50.785
Come on, get in.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.665
Let's go.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.975
Here we go. All done.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.074
Lookie here.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.075
It's a present.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.118
He loves presents.

38:11.247 --> 38:15.536
Remember when your Gran was laying here
all bloody and dead?

38:16.711 --> 38:18.667
Of course I do.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.710
-Hey, come on down here with me.
-No.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.510
It's okay.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.350
It's okay. It's okay.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.563
-Stop.
-Okay.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.190
Come on.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.495
-You smell good.
-You don't.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.628
Not at all.

39:01.798 --> 39:06.087
Makes you feel more alive
being in the presence of death, don't it?

39:09.639 --> 39:14.804
-Well, I guess you'd know that.
-Not as much as you.

39:14.978 --> 39:18.846
How come you let him
put his dead pecker inside you?

39:19.691 --> 39:21.227
It ain't natural, it ain't right.

39:21.401 --> 39:26.191
I don't think you're in any position
to talk about what's natural and right.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.016
What are you in the mood for?

39:57.186 --> 39:59.142
Oh, nothing for me, thank you.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.851
William, you have to eat
before we play Yahtzee.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.267
-I need you to play your best game.
-| only feed from Sookie.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.614
Why on earth would you do that?

40:13.578 --> 40:14.988
Your Majesty, I implore you.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.951
If you've told me everything about maenads,
give me leave to return to Bon Temps.

40:19.125 --> 40:21.081
Oh, dear.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.332
Ludis.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.341
Your Majesty.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.093
Ludis, this is my good friend
Bill Compton.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.015
-Would you allow him to feed from you?
-Yes, of course.

40:38.978 --> 40:42.311
-I appreciate the offer, but--
-William, you have to at least try him.

40:42.482 --> 40:44.097
I insist.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.268
I will have sex with you.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.606
That will not be necessary.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.834
I love watching two men together.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.134
Can I help you?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.639
Horse nettle.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.643
Also known as bull nettle,
the devil's tomato...

41:21.813 --> 41:26.227
...and my personal favorite,
the apple of Sodom.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.728
It's quite poisonous.

41:28.903 --> 41:34.944
But in the tiniest of doses,
a savory addition to any wine-based sauce.

41:37.745 --> 41:41.158
Gives it a pungent hint of madness.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.325
-A little touch of total abandon.
-Stop.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.835
And I can tell
that you are no stranger...

41:48.006 --> 41:50.088
-Bitch, I said stop.
-...to total abandon.

41:55.930 --> 41:59.593
Oh, poor Karl.

42:00.852 --> 42:04.094
You didn't really advance much
in this lifetime.

42:07.817 --> 42:11.275
You cook, don't you?

42:14.615 --> 42:16.526
Oh, I hate threes.

42:16.701 --> 42:19.943
Your Majesty, I really need to leave.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.918
Maenads are sad silly things.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.669
The world changed centuries ago...

42:30.840 --> 42:33.957
...and they're still waiting
for the God Who Comes.

42:34.927 --> 42:37.714
-Does he ever come?
-Of course not.

42:37.889 --> 42:39.629
Gods never actually show up.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.641
They only exist in humans' minds,
like money and morality.

42:43.811 --> 42:47.429
Ifl can't kill her,
how do I get her to leave Bon Temps?

42:47.607 --> 42:51.316
She has to believe that she's successfully
summoned forth Dionysus...

42:51.486 --> 42:53.568
...in hopes that he will ravish her...

42:53.738 --> 42:57.071
...quite literally devour her,
until she's lost into oblivion.

42:57.241 --> 43:01.280
So she seeks death, the true death.

43:01.454 --> 43:04.070
The one thing she's evolved beyond.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.499
Ironic, isn't it?

43:05.666 --> 43:08.499
You know, they're really not
that smart, these maenads.

43:08.669 --> 43:11.661
So how does she summon
this nonexistent god of hers?

43:11.839 --> 43:15.673
I never said he was nonexistent.
I just said he never comes.

43:15.843 --> 43:18.255
She believes if she finds
the perfect vessel...

43:18.429 --> 43:21.341
...sacrifices and devours
part of him or her...

43:21.516 --> 43:25.680
...surrounded by the magic of her familiars,
then her mad god will appear.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.185
At that point,
when she surrenders herself to him--

43:28.356 --> 43:31.689
-That's the point she can be killed.
-Who's the smartest boy in class?

43:32.693 --> 43:35.150
The perfect vessel. Human?

43:35.321 --> 43:38.984
-They prefer supernatural beings.
-The two-natured.

43:39.158 --> 43:42.525
Shifters, yes. And Weres.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.785
Fortunately,
they show little interest in us.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.992
Something about our hearts not beating.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.873
They'll try any other being
that straddles the two worlds.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.035
As long as it has a beating heart.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.329
Remember,
they've been trying for centuries.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.545
They're constantly improvising
in hopes of finding that one element...

43:58.719 --> 44:00.380
...that will make it all happen.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.420
Idiots.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.056
Excuse me.

44:06.227 --> 44:09.390
Hadley, keep our guest entertained,
won't you?

44:11.732 --> 44:14.223
Really? How interesting.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.859
How's my cousin Sookie?

44:17.029 --> 44:18.565
She's good.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.865
How's Gran?

44:24.829 --> 44:29.198
I'd love to talk to her sometime,
but I owe her so much money.

44:29.375 --> 44:32.583
I think it's best
that you are not in touch.

44:34.422 --> 44:38.791
I know there's no place for me
in that world anymore.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.583
Still think about them, though.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.303
That'll be all.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.599
Well, it seems your friend
Mr. Northman is here.

44:48.769 --> 44:52.011
Then it's definitely time for me to go.

44:52.190 --> 44:53.475
This alpha male posturing...

44:53.649 --> 44:57.983
...you two really should just fuck each other
and get it over with. I could watch.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.395
Thank you for seeing me.

45:01.282 --> 45:04.115
Enjoy your restricted diet.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.277
I do look forward to meeting her.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.630
Yahtzee.

45:27.767 --> 45:30.224
What are you doing here?

45:30.394 --> 45:32.976
Hoping the queen can tell me
how to kick a maenad's ass.

45:33.522 --> 45:38.983
Now, why would you wanna do that?
So that you'll look like a hero to Sookie?

45:39.153 --> 45:40.518
Oh, Billy.

45:40.696 --> 45:45.315
This paranoia,
it's really quite unbecoming.

45:45.493 --> 45:49.361
-Has she mentioned me?
-No.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.790
That was really quite desperate of you...

45:51.958 --> 45:55.496
...tricking her into drinking your blood
so that she became attracted to you.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.412
Unlike you who fed her your own blood
the night you met.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.384
-How do you know that?
-So you're not denying it?

46:02.551 --> 46:05.167
-I was saving her life.
-Isn't that convenient?

46:05.805 --> 46:08.262
You stay away from Sookie, Eric.

46:09.016 --> 46:13.350
Or I will tell the queen that you're forcing
humans to sell vampire blood for you.

46:16.732 --> 46:19.690
-You wouldn't.
-I won't.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.021
As long as you never
come close to Sookie again.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.191
I don't like threats, Bill.

46:24.365 --> 46:26.651
Neither do I.

46:45.594 --> 46:47.380
Why are we parking so far away?

46:47.555 --> 46:49.887
So we can sneak up on them.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.389
Element of surprise.

46:54.937 --> 46:57.394
Carbs. Load up.

47:12.121 --> 47:18.742
You think Sam could turn into a chicken
and lay his own egg?

47:18.919 --> 47:22.707
Wouldn't that be weird,
eating something that just came out of you?

47:23.257 --> 47:27.045
What kind of a perverted brain
would even think of something like that?

47:31.891 --> 47:34.758
Why ain't you never liked me, Andy?

47:34.935 --> 47:38.143
-Is it because of how much pussy I get?
-No.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.771
Because I ain't taking
any pussy away from you.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.977
There is more than enough
pussy to go around.

47:43.152 --> 47:45.438
It ain't about pussy.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.774
I just think you've had
everything too easy.

47:48.741 --> 47:50.857
What have I ever had that was easy?

47:51.035 --> 47:53.447
You were all-state quarterback.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.452
You think that was easy?

47:55.623 --> 47:59.866
I'm starting to have knee issues,
and I ain't even 30 yet. What else?

48:00.044 --> 48:02.786
Well, yeah, women do
just throw themselves at you.

48:02.963 --> 48:06.421
-You don't even have to do anything.
-Yeah, well, actually I do.

48:06.592 --> 48:09.675
I work out like a motherfucker...

48:09.845 --> 48:11.927
...and I watch a lot of porn
to learn stuff.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.384
What else?

48:16.727 --> 48:22.017
Look, my best friend
killed my grandma and my girlfriend.

48:22.191 --> 48:24.307
I come from no money.

48:24.485 --> 48:27.067
My mama and my daddy
died when I was 11.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.729
-So did mine.
-Your daddy died in Vietnam.

48:30.491 --> 48:33.824
But your mama ran off
with some Yankee race car driver.

48:33.994 --> 48:37.157
You may hate me, Andy Bellefleur.

48:37.331 --> 48:40.744
You may think you're better than me,
and maybe you are...

48:40.918 --> 48:47.915
...but you and me are the ones who have
received the calling to save this town.

48:48.092 --> 48:52.176
So obviously God
wants us to bury the hatchet.

48:52.346 --> 48:56.134
-|t's all up to us, ain't it?
-It is.

48:56.308 --> 48:57.809
And we can't fuck it up.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.934
We won't fuck it up.

49:01.105 --> 49:06.099
Because this town might be full
of crazy rednecks and dumbasses...

49:08.028 --> 49:11.816
-...but they're still Americans, Andy.
-And that used to mean something.

49:11.991 --> 49:14.232
It still does.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.120
Shotgun.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.581
Bandoleer.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.093
Let's go.

50:01.248 --> 50:04.866
Funny thing is,
I've always hated blood.

50:05.044 --> 50:08.081
Yeah, I never wanted to be
a coroner or a undertaker.

50:08.255 --> 50:12.749
I wanted to be a DJ or a boat captain.

50:12.927 --> 50:17.546
Mike, enough with the foreplay.
Let's just do it already.

50:18.599 --> 50:21.557
On one condition:
I have to be on top.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.685
Fine by me.
That's better for my back, anyway.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.607
Oh, yeah, baby.

50:33.781 --> 50:38.445
You-- Oh, yeah, I want me some of that.

50:38.619 --> 50:42.487
Show me how you can
shake your moneymaker.

50:44.625 --> 50:45.740
Oh, that's it.

50:54.843 --> 50:56.629
Tara?

51:02.309 --> 51:03.298
Too much?

51:06.689 --> 51:08.805
Way too much.

51:16.657 --> 51:19.148
Stop! What are you doing?

51:19.326 --> 51:20.987
Oh, tear it up. It's paid for.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.152
That's Gran's.

51:24.331 --> 51:27.573
No, I need it for the nest.

51:51.191 --> 51:52.601
Where you been at?

51:53.527 --> 51:55.028
I was looking for you.
