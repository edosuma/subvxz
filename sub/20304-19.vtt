<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.713 --> 00:07.340
I swear, Captain, I never touched the guy.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.300
I got a witness right in that cell.
He was right there.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.511
-I'm pregnant, Frank.
-Paul Grogin.

00:12.637 --> 00:13.888
Man, you're a scream.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.765
You know, you oughta be doing this
for a living.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.767
What do you think, I'm a member
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or something?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.269
The officer goes into the cell.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.188
The cop whacks him,
and then he chokes him.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.440
I have a special cream.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.525
It's made from the secretions
of queen bees.

00:25.942 --> 00:26.901
Secretions, huh?

00:27.235 --> 00:28.403
What's the matter, Captain?

00:28.737 --> 00:30.697
It's your father. He passed away.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.283
This is 500 big ones
in developmental capital.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
Man, people have been
coming up to me all day

00:35.035 --> 00:36.327
trying to get a piece of the action.

00:36.661 --> 00:40.874
You bully me into turning down this job,
and then I resent you for it forever.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.001
I have to be a virgin for the man I marry.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.169
I can relate to that.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.921
That doesn't mean
that we can't make each other happy.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.506
I want to make a life with you.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.675
I want us to be married.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.306
-Thank you. Thank you.
-(cymbals crash)

00:56.389 --> 00:59.184
-And I want this baby.
-You're serious about this, aren't you?

00:59.267 --> 01:04.189
I'm a father of a 16-year-old daughter
named Kristen Murphy, scuzzbag.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.317
And you, my friend,
are one dead child molester.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.653
I urge you not to perjure yourself,
Mr. Crockett.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.365
Get outta my face,
or I'll kick your teeth in.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.284
Your passing the polygraph
has gotta tell 'em something.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.787
They need a scapegoat for what happened
down there and I'm it.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.455
Have you ever had venereal disease?

01:20.538 --> 01:21.915
-Do you have it now?
-No!

01:21.998 --> 01:23.792
-Mother's maiden name?
-Zurilli.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.502
Hold it right there. Police officer.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.462
Get outta here!

01:37.764 --> 01:40.225
Come on, people,
we're almost halfway there.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.102
In response to the continued assaults,

01:42.894 --> 01:44.979
purse snatchings,
and generalized rampaging

01:45.063 --> 01:46.898
by a group of disenfranchised youth

01:46.981 --> 01:50.110
on Number 14 line
of our inner-city bus system,

01:50.193 --> 01:52.070
better known as the Gates Avenue Gauntlet,

01:52.612 --> 01:56.074
or more colloquially,
the Nairobi Joy Ride.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.033
(laughter)

01:57.951 --> 01:58.952
You know what he means by that.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.745
PHIL: ...Operation Bus Stop.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.747
Said operation to place behind the wheel

02:02.831 --> 02:07.752
of metro transit vehicle 147A,
our very own Lucille Bates.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.880
(cheers and applause)

02:11.172 --> 02:13.383
Still actively licensed Class 3

02:13.466 --> 02:18.096
from a prior and fortuitous
piloting stint at PS67.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.015
Plain clothes passenger backup

02:21.099 --> 02:25.145
to be discretely supplied
by Officer Hill and Renko.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.772
That's 147A, people.
East Utica to the river,

02:27.856 --> 02:31.776
so let's keep our radios peeled
for additional backup, shall we?

02:31.860 --> 02:35.947
Item nine. Um, hey, hey,
Schmeltzer, do you mind?

02:36.489 --> 02:38.700
Item nine, on a somewhat more
parochial note,

02:39.492 --> 02:42.453
referencing the transfer per request
to Washington Heights

02:42.745 --> 02:44.122
of Officer Robin Tattaglia.

02:44.205 --> 02:48.376
Said transfer duly approved,
effective as of a.m. of tomorrow.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.921
Though her sojourn be regrettably brief,

02:52.005 --> 02:56.926
suffice it to say she leaves this hill
a gentler domain for her presence,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.888
a more melancholy one for her departure.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.183
Now, we're just 28 blocks
and an interprecinct pension away,

03:03.474 --> 03:05.560
so let's not be a stranger, huh, Robin?

03:05.935 --> 03:09.314
Item ten, regarding a 1:00 p.m.
community meeting

03:09.397 --> 03:12.275
to be held today
at the Holy Christ Baptist Church

03:12.734 --> 03:14.235
to air citizens' grievances

03:14.319 --> 03:17.030
resulting from
the unfortunate in-custody death

03:17.572 --> 03:20.575
in cell five last Tuesday
of one Lynn Tatum.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.827
In addition to local religious
and civic leaders,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.705
said meeting is expected to be
departmentally represented

03:25.788 --> 03:27.916
by Chief Daniels, Captain Furillo,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.667
and Lieutenants Goldblume and Dibble,

03:29.751 --> 03:32.921
along with Councilman Mangiotti
of the 17th District.

I don't need to tell you
where the high temperature of the city's

03:35.506 --> 03:37.550
expected to be recorded today.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.136
In anticipation of which,
the following officers

03:40.220 --> 03:42.639
are hereby assigned to perimeter duty,

03:42.722 --> 03:47.101
Peterson, Joyce, Tepaz, Dicarlo,
Militello, Hurley.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.020
As a tangential cautionary, people,

03:49.103 --> 03:51.648
given the somewhat strong backlash
on this one,

03:51.731 --> 03:54.150
let's be especially circumspect

03:54.234 --> 03:57.779
in our dealings with the citizenry
these next few days, shall we?

03:58.238 --> 04:02.992
Particularly with regards
to the application of physical force.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.871
Last item, I'm sure most of you
are aware by now

04:06.955 --> 04:09.332
that Detective Belker
lost his father yesterday.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.167
Those of you wishing to pay your respects

04:11.251 --> 04:14.379
may do so at Halman's Funeral Home
on West Huron.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.214
From 9:00 to 12:00, today.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.508
From which function,
the department shall be represented

04:18.591 --> 04:19.926
by Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.845
Those of you inclined to chip in
for a precinct wreath

04:23.429 --> 04:25.932
may do so care of Leo at the front desk.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.309
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.270
And, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.981
Let's be careful out there.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.150
(indistinct chatter)

04:37.235 --> 04:38.945
You have bugs on your face.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.489
You have bugs all on your face.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.033
You can just lighten up, pally.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.036
Whatever happened between me
and Kristen out there is my business.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.330
(telephones ringing)

04:52.500 --> 04:53.835
Hey, Mick, what are you doing?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
I don't know.
I woke up about 2:00 this morning.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.215
I couldn't get back to sleep.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.719
My mom's sleeping at my sister's.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.930
I'm gonna go over there in a little while,
bring her some breakfast.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.474
Just thought I'd catch up
on some paperwork.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.562
It's too cold out to walk.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.523
Mick, are you sure you're all right
about my transfer?

05:16.065 --> 05:17.984
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-I better be going.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.445
I'll see you at your mom's at 4:00, okay?

05:20.528 --> 05:21.362
Yeah.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.613
Okay.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.452
(sighs)

05:31.456 --> 05:33.750

07:21.190 --> 07:23.151

-(horn honking)

07:25.528 --> 07:27.738
Nice move, moron!

07:28.573 --> 07:33.494
(punk music playing)

07:38.791 --> 07:39.625
Uh.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.589
Thirty-five cents,
and I get a roller-coaster ride already.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.551
And did you-- Did you hear
the mouth on that woman?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.887
Nasty. Gee.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.806
Here's a perfectly good transfer,
and she wouldn't take it.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.558
See? Perfectly good.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.103
Ma'am, this transfer expired
six months ago.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.315
Oh, is that so, Mr. Bus Commissioner?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.193
Well, let me tell you something,
Professor Know-It-All...

08:05.985 --> 08:06.944
(gasps)

08:07.278 --> 08:09.572
Oh, P.U.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.949
Talk about something expiring.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.994
Oh, that's disgusting.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.621
Ma'am, that wasn't me.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.081
Hey, look, it was the guy right behind me.

08:19.832 --> 08:24.045
Oh, the bus fumes aren't bad enough,
Mr. Stink-o.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.088
You gotta put your two cents in.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.676
In a barn with livestock
you were brought up, I suppose.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.304
Ma'am, if you don't like
the ambiance back here,

08:33.387 --> 08:36.432
I suggest you vamoose
to another section of the bus.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.559
Another section of the bus?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.479
Another section of the state's
more like it.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.193
(punk music continues)

08:48.402 --> 08:49.320
Go away!

08:51.656 --> 08:54.325
And you, with the big mouth
and the no respect.

08:58.204 --> 09:01.582
Hey, Sid Vicious, I thought I told you
to turn that thing off.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.211
I can't hear you, stretch. The radio's on.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.170
LUCY: You heard me.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.548
And while you're at it,
put out that cigarette.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.511
-What are you, my mother?
-Do I look like a test tube?

09:13.594 --> 09:15.429
(volume increases)

09:15.513 --> 09:18.182
I said, "turn it down"!
Can you read this sign?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.977
Obviously you can't, because they don't
teach them to read on Mars!

09:21.352 --> 09:24.564
So listen to this,
no music, no smoking, no food or drink,

09:24.647 --> 09:27.650
no talking to the driver,
and no spitting, sweetheart!

09:27.733 --> 09:29.360
So far, you're batting 800.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.781
Okay, that's funny.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.158
Make that five for five, sweet meat.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.994
No, really, that's very funny.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.706
Come here! Get out!

09:50.673 --> 09:53.634
-Frank, I've made up my mind.
-Fay?

10:01.517 --> 10:02.852
I'm gonna have the baby.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.273
Uh, are you sure
you've given enough thought

10:07.356 --> 10:11.402
to how this is gonna affect you
financially, emotionally,

10:12.278 --> 10:13.362
-socially?
-(sighs)

10:14.030 --> 10:16.407
Frank, I have thought
of practically nothing else

10:16.490 --> 10:17.658
for the last three days.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.703
What about Grogin?
Is he still taking a hard line?

10:20.786 --> 10:23.372
Oh, I don't know.
I guess so. It doesn't matter.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.334
I wouldn't even take diaper money
from that worm now.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.211
As far as those social services
are concerned,

10:29.879 --> 10:32.923
well, I've run that gauntlet.
And you want to know something, Frank?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.425
I don't need them.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.014
I woke up this morning with...

10:41.599 --> 10:46.354
the most warm, beautiful memory
of giving birth to Frank Jr.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.981
Suddenly it was all clear to me.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.276
I'm healthy, I have resources,

10:52.777 --> 10:54.487
and I want this baby.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.322
You're serious about this, aren't you?

10:56.405 --> 10:59.367
I have never been more serious
about anything in my life.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.243
Then I'm with you.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.703
(chuckles)

11:07.750 --> 11:13.422
I feel stronger and more directed
about myself than I have in years.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.800
I even have the makings
for a wonderful article

11:15.883 --> 11:18.052
that I'm gonna meet
with<i> Metro Gazette </i>on this morning.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.222
What do you think?
Uh, "Divorced, Pregnant, and Alone:

11:21.305 --> 11:23.849
One Woman's Odyssey
Through the Bureaucratic Maze."

11:26.102 --> 11:27.436
It has a ring to it.

11:28.062 --> 11:28.896
(chuckles)

11:29.647 --> 11:32.108
Never say "ring" to an unmarried mother.
(laughs)

11:33.234 --> 11:36.487
Oh, God. Particularly one who's late
for a 9:00 appointment.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.373
Thanks, Frank.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.292
(door closes)

11:56.549 --> 11:57.883
Is your first name Joseph?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.051
Yes.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.432
Did you enter Lynn Tatum's holding cell
on the 14th of this month?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.558
No.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.478
Prior to this month,
did you use more force than was necessary

12:09.562 --> 12:10.813
in the course of an arrest?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.274
(sighs) Yes.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.651
Any cop who says no to that is full of it.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.986
Just answer yes or no.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.741
Are you currently an officer
of the Hill Street precinct?

12:21.949 --> 12:22.783
Yes.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.162
Did you choke Lynn Tatum
at any time the man was in custody?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.332
No. I mean, out on the street, yes,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.126
but not while he was in custody.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.591
Did you choke Lynn Tatum at any time
after his arrival in the precinct house?

12:39.717 --> 12:40.551
No.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.720
(telephones ringing)

12:43.679 --> 12:46.891
Frank, everyone is canceling
from the town meeting.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.269
If you want to reschedule,
I better let the reverend know quickly.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.437
Who's pulling out?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.815
The mayor, Chief Daniels.
Scheduling conflicts.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.942
I get the feeling this is chronic.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.487
Well, let's go ahead
and take our medicine.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.364
-Do you want me to come with you?
-No, I need you here, Ray.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.493
And yet Henry Goldblume is going with you.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.828
Ray, part of Henry's job
is public relations.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.705
Part of your job is to be here
when I need you.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.374
You doubt my ability
for leadership, Frank,

13:12.458 --> 13:14.043
but when do you allow me to lead?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.378
Listen to me, Ray.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.756
After our talk the other day,

13:19.381 --> 13:21.050
I pulled your evaluation forms.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.469
Now, they could be stronger, probably.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.806
But I think you'll have to agree,
that, overall, they're pretty positive.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.641
"I have every confidence

13:28.724 --> 13:31.060
"that Lieutenant Calletano's
leadership abilities

13:31.143 --> 13:33.062
will continue to develop over time."

13:33.145 --> 13:35.523
And that's an accurate expression
of my opinion.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.608
Now, that's only one of nine categories,

13:38.067 --> 13:40.903
but overall, is the evaluation positive?

13:41.737 --> 13:42.571
Yes.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.573
And still there's no guarantee
of your captaincy.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.243
I mean, whether you get it or not,
or whether I'm fair to you all the time,

13:47.326 --> 13:48.452
you still have a job to do here.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.663
-Have I ever not done it?
-No.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.790
Have you ever had reason
to doubt my loyalty?

13:52.873 --> 13:53.707
No, never.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.877
I'll do my job, Frank.
That doesn't mean I have to be happy.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.254
Fair enough.

13:58.629 --> 14:02.091
And again,
someday I am going to be captain.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.592
I don't doubt that, Ray.

14:06.095 --> 14:06.929
Miss Davenport.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.936
-Hi.
-Frank.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.438
Have you ever had venereal disease?
Do you have it now?

14:17.189 --> 14:18.399
N-- no!

14:19.024 --> 14:20.109
Mother's maiden name?

14:20.609 --> 14:22.736
Zurilli, one R, two L's.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.156
Uh, date of your final divorce.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.784
-Uh...
-Date your divorce was final, I meant.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.581
January 16, 1979. What is that?

14:33.664 --> 14:35.583
(sighs) A marriage license, Furillo.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.837
The clerk's office
waived the three-day wait.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.298
They're gonna trust us on the Wassermanns.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.258
Care to put your money
where your mouth is?

14:45.593 --> 14:46.427
(chuckles)

14:47.845 --> 14:50.139
We are gathered here
in the presence of this witness

14:50.806 --> 14:53.309
for the purpose of uniting
this couple in matrimony.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.479
This contract is most solemn,
not to be taken lightly,

14:58.105 --> 15:00.190
but thoughtfully, deeply,

15:01.442 --> 15:02.860
and with a full understanding

15:03.277 --> 15:06.071
of the responsibility
of the commitment you're about to make.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.407
Do you, Francis Furillo,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.868
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

15:12.786 --> 15:13.621
I do.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.707
Do you, Joyce Davenport,

15:16.999 --> 15:19.168
take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

15:20.210 --> 15:21.045
I do.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.423
Do you each promise
to love and comfort one another

15:25.132 --> 15:28.052
in adversity as well as in prosperity,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.220
in sickness as well as in health,

15:30.596 --> 15:34.433
and forsaking all others,
remain faithful to each other?

15:36.560 --> 15:37.561
-We will.
-We do.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.065
By the power vested in me by this state,

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
I pronounce you husband and wife.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.446
You may kiss the bride
should you feel so inclined.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.683
You know why they call them punks?
'Cause they look like punks.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.643
When I went to school,
you would take blue hair like that--

16:17.726 --> 16:19.061
You would look good with blue hair.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.022
Hey, Joe, nice to see you
out in the old salt mines, buddy.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.232
It's nice to be out.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.401
-Hey, how'd Luce make out this morning?
-She did real good.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.486
That girl could've been
a tank driver in 'Nam,

16:27.569 --> 16:29.863
the way she moves that cattle car
up and down the street.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.825
She took this here, this punk--

16:32.908 --> 16:34.576
Hey, Ralph Kramden, how you doing?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.787
One of these days, Norton, huh?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.291
Hey, they tell me you have a future
in transportation.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.960
Yeah, I got a real future.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.796
It's about as promising as a shin splint.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.131
So far this morning,

16:47.631 --> 16:50.801
I got two junkies lose their lunch
in the backseat,

16:51.135 --> 16:53.387
I got three cabbies shooting me the bird,

16:53.929 --> 16:57.683
I got this Johnny Rotten clone
who spits up grape soda on my shoes,

16:57.766 --> 17:00.686
and I got a 'lude freak
who gets his head stuck in the rear exit.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.564
So did you get the results?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.399
What, the lie-detector test?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.818
No, your pap smear, Joe. Come on.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.612
I got straight A's.
I passed with flying colors.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.448
What else is new?

17:13.157 --> 17:14.533
Yeah, it doesn't mean anything.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.160
What're you talking about?

17:16.243 --> 17:18.454
You passing the polygraph
has gotta tell them something.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.331
-Hey, it's inadmissible in court.
-It isn't even gonna get to court.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.584
You still don't get it, do you, Luce?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.545
They need a scapegoat
for what happened down there, and I'm it.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.215
You know something, Joe?
You're getting paranoid.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.760
I'm not paranoid. I'm just facing facts.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.597
I'm having the chow mein.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.809
I can only repeat
that we understand your frustration

17:40.893 --> 17:42.352
and we share your concern.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.938
(murmuring)

17:45.230 --> 17:48.400
Captain, may I point out

17:48.484 --> 17:52.279
the absence of a few prominent invitees,

17:52.362 --> 17:54.698
like the mayor and the chief of police?

17:54.782 --> 17:55.949
WOMAN: Yes, where are they?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.494
Is that the kind of concern
you're talking about?

17:58.744 --> 18:02.122
Nobody's gonna deny that this is
a political hot potato, Reverend.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.876
We're also not about to deny
that there have been times

18:06.335 --> 18:09.296
when people in police custody
have died at police hands.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.423
ALL: Yeah.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.466
HENRY: It's happened.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.968
It's happened to Black people,

18:15.469 --> 18:18.639
and we can understand your thinking
that it may have happened to Lynn Tatum.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.973
On the other hand,

18:21.725 --> 18:24.770
we have no choice
but to conduct the investigation

18:24.853 --> 18:26.730
entirely as the evidence leads us.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.190
I was on that street!

18:28.273 --> 18:31.318
I saw that cop choking that boy!
He hated that boy!

18:32.027 --> 18:34.071
(clamoring)

18:38.450 --> 18:41.495
Captain, in the last five years,

18:41.578 --> 18:45.541
there has been 14 in-custody deaths
in the police stations of this city.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.294
Thirteen of the people who died
were Black.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.214
The other, Hispanic.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.843
Now, there's a message in those figures,
and we read it loud and clear.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.345
The message is that, statistically,

18:58.428 --> 19:02.391
89 percent of the population of the Hill
is Black and Hispanic!

19:02.474 --> 19:06.186
That means that an overwhelming percentage
of the people arrested there

19:06.270 --> 19:07.646
are going to be Black or Hispanic.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.774
Listen, I don't care
anything about statistics.

19:12.276 --> 19:17.030
My son is dead,
and there's no reason for it.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.410
Now, I had a good son.
He didn't go around making trouble.

19:21.910 --> 19:25.539
Look, an investigation is being conducted
into the death of Lynn Tatum.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.001
If that investigation
points to a police officer,

19:29.084 --> 19:31.461
that officer will be charged
and brought to trial.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.881
Captain, hurray for you.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.803
I can only promise you
that every effort will be made

19:39.887 --> 19:43.098
to get to the bottom
of this prisoner's death.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.642
(indistinct chatter)

19:49.188 --> 19:50.606
You're gonna be remembered
as that bankrupt,

19:50.689 --> 19:51.648
watermelon-headed club owner

19:51.732 --> 19:54.735
out on Highway 9 that blew a chance
to book Vic Hitler's comic debut

19:54.818 --> 19:56.737
-for nothing!
-(receiver slams)

19:58.238 --> 19:59.865
You think you got it rough?
A fellow walks up to me and says,

19:59.948 --> 20:02.451
"You see a cop around here?" I say, "No."
He says, "Okay, stick 'em up."

20:02.534 --> 20:04.077
(laughs)

20:04.411 --> 20:06.580
Did you hear the one
about the overly familiar midget?

20:06.663 --> 20:08.790
Walks in this bar,
kissed everyone in the joint.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.294
(both laughing)

20:12.377 --> 20:13.545
Sweetheart, how are you?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.672
Oh, I am pumped. I am pumped.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.717
I stayed up half the night, you know,
working up new material in my motel room.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.802
So how are we doing on bookings?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.221
-Oh, great, Vic. Just great.
-Oh, good. Good.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.513
I-- I gotta tell you, though,

20:23.597 --> 20:26.308
I've been running into a lot of static
on account of the name thing.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.686
-Oh, come on.
-Look, look, look, before you put the idea

20:29.770 --> 20:32.397
out of your mind completely,
just do me a favor.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.108
Just consider these alternatives
that I cooked up.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.527
"Vic Roma. Vic Dakota." That's cute.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.197
"Vic Anthony. Vic Vegas"? Ugh.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.659
Sweetheart, I'm about to throw my lunch
over a fence,

20:43.742 --> 20:45.118
and I ain't even had breakfast yet.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.329
Come on, Vic. What's the big deal?
It's only a name.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.415
Yeah, only a name that's been in my family
for over 400 years.

20:50.666 --> 20:53.460
That's a good 320 longer
than that deranged house painter Adolf.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.419
If the truth be known,

20:54.503 --> 20:56.713
came into the world
a son of an Austrian pencil pusher

20:56.797 --> 20:57.965
by the name of Schicklgruber.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.549
-No kidding.
-Yeah.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.636
I don't even want to tell you
what my grandfather told me

21:02.719 --> 21:04.471
on his deathbed 30 years ago.

21:05.806 --> 21:10.269
He said, "Vic, I've gone through a lot of
pain in this life on account of it,

21:11.103 --> 21:14.481
but promise me, son,
promise me you'll never forsake...

21:16.775 --> 21:17.859
the family name."

21:18.777 --> 21:19.611
Whew.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.951
I'm sorry, John,
but those are the cards I was dealt.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.246
Vic Hitler, it stays.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.292
Come on,
to hell with his polygraph, Frank.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.294
I've got half the population
of your precinct

21:35.377 --> 21:36.253
screaming bloody murder.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.547
That's no basis for convening
a grand jury.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.049
Look, I'm not saying we're coming down
with an indictment on your client.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.343
But we're certainly justified
having this biker testify.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.012
You really want to grease
the wheels of justice?

21:45.095 --> 21:47.222
You take a closer look
at your star witness.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
Crockett had motive, access,

21:49.224 --> 21:50.851
and a record of violent crimes
two inches thick.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.021
There isn't a shred of evidence
against Crockett, and you know it, Frank.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.273
What there is, since 11:00 this morning,

21:56.356 --> 21:59.026
is a forensics report
showing microfibers from Coffey's shirt

21:59.109 --> 22:00.027
on Lynn Tatum's neck.

22:00.110 --> 22:03.071
Everybody knows Coffey used a choke hold
making the arrest.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.074
No fibers from Crockett anywhere
on Tatum's person,

22:06.158 --> 22:07.242
and Crockett was wearing a shirt--

22:07.326 --> 22:08.577
Whose sleeves were probably rolled up.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.746
You care to join in this discussion,
Counselor?

22:10.954 --> 22:13.206
What discussion?
The man's mind is made up.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.042
FRANK: So are we finished here?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.002
Oh, yeah, yeah. Before we began.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.296
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.346
-Will you be at the grand jury hearing?
-If my officer has to be.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.810
I got to get off this bus.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.438
-Get off? What are you, crazy?
-I'm sorry, Luce.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.024
My bladder sounded a ten-minute warning
about five blocks ago,

22:39.107 --> 22:40.567
and I got to get off.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.028
It's gonna look conspicuous
if I have to wait for you.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.571
Well, it's gonna look
a lot more conspicuous

22:44.654 --> 22:46.907
if I don't get off this bus,
if you catch my drift.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.911
Okay. Okay. But you better be quick.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.455
Excuse me, ma'am,
for having bodily functions.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.415
Yo! Move back!

22:55.665 --> 22:57.876
Everybody, just be cool
and give up the goodies.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.920
If you think about moving,
I'll blow your head upside this bus

23:00.003 --> 23:01.004
and you know that.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.005
MAN 1: Hand over your purse, mama.

23:02.089 --> 23:03.465
Hurry up!

23:03.548 --> 23:04.633
MAN 2: Give me the money! Come on!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.676
Hold it right there. Police officer.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.345
Get outta here!

23:12.474 --> 23:14.643
Get out the way! He's got a gun. Freeze!

23:31.451 --> 23:33.954
If you want to shack up in some van
with a 16-year-old,

23:34.037 --> 23:35.247
that's your business, babe.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.250
But don't call me into the trial
as a character witness.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.001
Oh, man.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.629
Oh, Leo, for God's sake, not here.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.714
Better in here
than all over the front desk.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.553
J.D.: I'm telling you, man,
Kristen is a very mature 16-year-old.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.721
And hey, hey, I'm a young 35.

23:51.805 --> 23:55.475
(chuckles) Yeah. Thirty five
going on ten to twenty upstate.

23:55.976 --> 24:00.230
Thanks for the advice, you dried-up,
refried Baptist prude.

24:03.316 --> 24:04.609
You John D. LaRue?

24:04.693 --> 24:05.944
Yeah. Who wants to know?

24:06.319 --> 24:07.696
Just a guy who's gonna break
both your legs

24:07.779 --> 24:09.322
and flush you down the toilet.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.117
Hey, if it's about Manusko,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.327
you tell him he'll have his bread
by Tuesday.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.495
MAN: Uh-uh.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.872
J.D.: Oh, oh, Sheila.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.039
Yeah, well, the kid ain't mine.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.249
-I swear to God.
-Uh-uh.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.335
Okay, well, then why don't you just cut
this Ghost-of-Christmas-Past routine?

24:22.419 --> 24:24.045
Tell me who the hell are you?

24:25.172 --> 24:28.300
I'm a father of a 16-year-old
jewel of a daughter

24:28.383 --> 24:30.469
named Kristen Murphy, scuzzbag.

24:31.386 --> 24:34.598
And you, my friend,
are one dead child molester.

24:34.890 --> 24:38.351
I swear to God, Mr. Murphy,
hey, it was a field trip.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.855
I mean, I mean,
we were talking about criminology.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.773
You know, basic surveillance.

24:44.524 --> 24:45.942
I never laid a hand on her.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.362
I left her in the van.
I didn't even go back.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.823
If she says I touched her, she's lying.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.784
You calling my baby a liar?

24:54.868 --> 24:57.120
Of course not. Oh, my God.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.788
Don't tell me that's a gun.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.999
Say your prayers, scuzzbag.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.751
J.D.: Please, man, please.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.004
I'll never touch a girl
under 18 as long as I live.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.841
Okay, 25, 30, 35.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.802
Go ahead. Go ahead and shoot.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.970
You gotta shoot the junkie first.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.848
(laughter)

25:18.642 --> 25:19.476
ANDY: "Don't do it!"

25:19.559 --> 25:20.727
(laughter)

25:22.854 --> 25:27.359
Jack Haggerty,
roaming all the way from midtown.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.027
-(laughter)
-Vice.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.421
-Kristen. Oh, hi.
-Hi.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.341
I waited for you in the van
for an hour last night.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.219
Yeah. I know. I know.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.346
Look, uh, I tried to call you at school.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.765
-Can we talk here for a minute?
-Sure.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.767
Okay. Can I get you a chair?

26:01.351 --> 26:02.936
That's okay. I'm fine.

26:05.105 --> 26:05.939
(sighs)

26:08.233 --> 26:11.069
I, uh, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching.

26:12.070 --> 26:12.988
About us, I mean.

26:14.447 --> 26:18.535
I want you to know
this is very, very hard for me to say.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.121
I mean, I like you a lot.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.082
More than that, I respect you.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.002
(sighs)

26:27.252 --> 26:30.088
Yeah, you're probably the greatest
16-year-old I've ever known,

26:31.673 --> 26:33.633
but I don't think it's a good idea,
you and me.

26:33.717 --> 26:37.012
It just won't work.
You need somebody your own age.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.808
Now, look, if you ever get in a real jam,

26:41.891 --> 26:44.227
an emergency or something,
if you're ever lonely,

26:44.603 --> 26:47.731
if you're ever lonely,
you can always call me.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.318
But us as a steady thing?

26:52.861 --> 26:55.697
-I think we'd better call it off.
-Okay.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.119
Bye.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.666
(telephone ringing)

27:11.004 --> 27:12.005
Yeah? Yeah?

27:13.048 --> 27:14.716
Yeah, it's him speaking. Who is this?

27:15.550 --> 27:16.384
Tony who?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.304
(stammers) Tony from Eugene. Tony!

27:19.387 --> 27:21.473
Hey, hey, Tony baby! What's happening?

27:22.766 --> 27:23.600
Really?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.227
Hey, that's too bad.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.021
Uh, what's wrong with the guy?

27:29.064 --> 27:31.608
Appendicitis. Ugh.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.445
(stammers) Well, sure, we can make it.
You bet.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.156
7:30? See you there. Bye.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.075
Hey, hey, oh!

27:40.158 --> 27:41.493
Oh, Leo! Leo!

27:41.701 --> 27:42.702
Have you seen Vic?

27:42.786 --> 27:45.580
Last I heard, he was down
in the locker room trying to cop some Zs.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.124
-Any news?
-Just keep your dance card clear

27:48.208 --> 27:49.250
for tonight, honey.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.468
-Bobby.
-Captain.

28:00.929 --> 28:01.805
How'd it go?

28:02.806 --> 28:05.225
We got two of them.
The other two got away.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.313
One of the kids who escaped
took a shot at me,

28:11.272 --> 28:13.233
and I had him right in my sights,
and then...

28:14.234 --> 28:15.527
I couldn't pull the trigger.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.487
What was the crowd situation?

28:18.446 --> 28:21.408
-There were other people around.
-I'd say you showed good judgment.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.037
Maybe, but I gotta tell you, Captain,

28:26.121 --> 28:27.497
part of why I didn't pull that trigger

28:27.580 --> 28:29.374
was because I didn't want to get hung up
like Joe Coffey!

28:29.666 --> 28:30.500
I understand.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.086
It makes me angry
to have thoughts like that

28:33.169 --> 28:35.505
running through my mind
when I'm out on the streets.

28:35.588 --> 28:38.007
Bobby, the Hill's
been a powder keg lately,

28:38.341 --> 28:40.218
and your deciding
not to bring down a perpetrator

28:40.301 --> 28:42.387
in a situation
where a mistake might buy a riot

28:42.470 --> 28:44.806
strikes me as exercising
sensible restraint.

28:45.223 --> 28:48.393
That kind of restraint, Captain,
could cost lives, too!

28:48.476 --> 28:49.978
It's a delicate balance,

28:50.645 --> 28:53.690
but given the existing atmosphere,
I'd say you made the right choice.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.525
(sighs)

28:58.403 --> 28:59.446
Uh, Bobby?

29:00.822 --> 29:02.615
I got married this afternoon.

29:03.783 --> 29:04.617
You're kidding.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.496
-Congratulations, Captain!
-Thanks.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.457
-My best to the bride.
-I'll tell her.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.793
Is it-- is it a secret?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.920
(chuckles) No.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.383
(laughs)

29:21.926 --> 29:23.845
-Eugene's Comedy Empire?
-You got it, Victor.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.389
-Did your buddy, John, come through?
-You know the tradition that place has?

29:26.473 --> 29:28.266
All right, so they served
a couple of minors once.

29:28.349 --> 29:30.852
Wait a minute.
I'm going back 15, 20 years.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.771
Eugene's is one of the classic toilets.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.440
-Hey, look, beggars can't be choosers.
-You're still not getting it.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.066
I mean,
some of the top guys started there.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.819
You know, Shecky, Don, I think that's even
where Lenny Bruce O.D.'d.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.988
Why didn't you wake me up sooner?
I got a million things I gotta do.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.656
I mean, my whole time clock
is gonna be off.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.867
Hey, hey, as long
as the gag meter's running.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.328
-That's like riding a bike.
-Yeah, a lot of people around here

29:48.411 --> 29:50.205
are gonna be sorry they missed the boat.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.916
Hey, good news, Frank!

29:53.708 --> 29:56.920
<i>Metro Gazette </i>is very enthusiastic
about my article.

29:57.003 --> 29:58.546
They want to see a rough draft by Friday.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.756
Oh, great, Fay.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.383
Hey, listen, I'm missing one of my
folders. I think I may have left it

30:02.467 --> 30:03.301
-in your office.
-Sure.

30:03.593 --> 30:04.928
Congratulations, Captain.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.222
-Thanks, Leo.
-Wonderful news!

30:07.764 --> 30:08.932
Congratulations for what?

30:09.015 --> 30:10.725
-Come on.
-What?

30:11.017 --> 30:12.185
We have to talk, Fay.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.485
So what's the big mystery?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.196
Uh, Fay, listen,

30:23.279 --> 30:27.450
Uh, I-- I was gonna tell you this
under better circumstances.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.702
I mean, I was gonna come by
after work and, uh...

30:30.078 --> 30:30.912
What?

30:32.580 --> 30:34.040
I got married this afternoon.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.337
-Married?
-Yep.

30:40.588 --> 30:43.091
(shudders) Re-- really, Frank? Married?

30:43.758 --> 30:44.592
Yes.

30:46.052 --> 30:46.886
Oh, boy.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.514
(stammers) Sit down. Sit down.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.058
Oh, boy.

30:53.101 --> 30:53.935
You okay?

30:55.144 --> 30:55.979
(chuckles)

30:56.980 --> 30:58.982
Uh, Joyce Davenport?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.066
(laughs)

31:01.276 --> 31:04.362
What a stupid thing to ask.
Of course it's Joyce.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.157
It's just that, well,
I'm just so surprised, Frank.

31:08.241 --> 31:13.413
It's, uh-- I'm-- I'm happy for you.
Really, I am. I'm...

31:14.205 --> 31:17.959
I know that you're gonna be very happy,
and that Joyce is...

31:19.419 --> 31:20.253
Thank you.

31:23.798 --> 31:26.259
Of course, your timing's
pretty damn lousy, I have to say that.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.260
How do you mean?

31:27.552 --> 31:28.428
Well...

31:29.345 --> 31:31.139
(stammering) Well, you know,
it's just that I'm pregnant,

31:31.222 --> 31:35.602
and that I'm just really trying
to get it all together,

31:35.685 --> 31:38.855
and I'm finally seeing the light
at the end of the tunnel,

31:38.938 --> 31:41.858
and then you turn it into another train!

31:42.233 --> 31:44.944
Frank, how could you do this to me?

31:45.028 --> 31:46.154
Is this what you meant when you said

31:46.237 --> 31:48.573
that no matter what I decided,
you'd be there for me?

31:48.656 --> 31:50.241
I mean, you call this help?

31:50.325 --> 31:52.785
Oh, come on, Fay.
We both have lives to live.

31:52.869 --> 31:53.953
Let me live mine.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.164
(sniffling)

31:56.748 --> 31:58.833
I'm sorry, Frank. Really, I'm sorry. I...

32:01.210 --> 32:02.378
I'm okay, really.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.007
I'm still gonna be there
for you and Frank Jr.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.093
And any new starters.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.846
(sniffling)

32:16.142 --> 32:18.978
I really am happy for you, Frank.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.564
I know you wanted this.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.111
I'm all right. I'm okay.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.114
Congratulations.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.241
Thank you.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.161
And-- and, um,

32:35.495 --> 32:38.289
please give my best wishes to Mrs...

32:39.832 --> 32:40.667
Joyce.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.589
(sniffles)

32:47.924 --> 32:48.841
(giggles)

32:53.513 --> 32:55.473
You want to hear
the stupidest thing, Frank?

32:55.556 --> 32:56.391
FRANK: Hmm?

32:58.351 --> 32:59.769
Up to two minutes ago...

33:02.105 --> 33:04.816
with everything
that's happened between us,

33:06.442 --> 33:07.944
up to two minutes ago, uh...

33:11.072 --> 33:13.032
I always thought we'd get back together.

33:32.635 --> 33:34.429
Miss Tastee-Freez.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.305
Five minutes.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.474
Oh, it doesn't have to happen that fast.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.936
I'm here to prepare you
for your grand-jury testimony.

33:42.979 --> 33:43.980
Outstanding.

33:45.314 --> 33:49.318
You're going to be questioned about events
leading to the death of Lynn Tatum.

33:49.902 --> 33:53.156
You'll be giving testimony under oath.
You're expected to answer truthfully.

33:53.489 --> 33:55.950
You have the right
not to incriminate yourself.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.786
I can't come into the hearing room,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.039
but if you're confused by a question,

34:01.330 --> 34:03.082
or you want to talk to me
for any other reason,

34:03.166 --> 34:05.835
the judge will grant a recess,
and we can confer in this room.

34:05.918 --> 34:06.878
Do you understand?

34:06.961 --> 34:09.213
I don't think we'll be doing
too much conferring.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.300
That's your prerogative, Mr. Crockett.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.887
The cops want that guinea.
I'm gonna give him to 'em.

34:16.345 --> 34:18.097
They want the truth, Mr. Crockett.

34:18.431 --> 34:22.351
Listen, lady, you people been on my case
since I was five years old.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.645
You give me a chance
to hand some of it back,

34:24.729 --> 34:25.772
you bet I'm going to.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.107
I'm gonna jive. I'm gonna lie.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.734
I'm gonna teach that guinea cop

34:29.817 --> 34:30.943
-just what it means--
-Mr. Crockett,

34:31.736 --> 34:34.697
you've just told me you intend to lie
in a court proceeding.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.450
This would be a crime,
and I urge you as your attorney

34:37.533 --> 34:39.952
and an officer of the court not to do it.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.870
(chuckles)

34:42.747 --> 34:45.792
Oh, well, sure, I mean, if you<i> urge </i>me.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.712
If you don't reconsider,
I'll have to withdraw as your counsel.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.340
You must not stay on too many cases, huh?

34:54.634 --> 34:56.302
I cooled that nigger.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.763
You betcha I'm gonna lie.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.809
I urge you not to perjure yourself,
Mr. Crockett.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.519
You said that.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.145
Will you reconsider?

35:07.021 --> 35:10.775
Get outta my face
or I'll kick your teeth in.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.366
You'll have to delay Crockett's testimony.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.034
-I can't represent him.
-What do you mean?

35:20.118 --> 35:22.161
I can't represent. Get him another lawyer.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.830
Look, I know the guy's
no day at the beach--

35:23.913 --> 35:25.832
Look, it's not a personality conflict.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.875
-Would you mind telling me what it is?
-I can't represent.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.962
-I'll inform Judge Michaels.
-Hey, Joyce, tell me what's going on.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.422
Is he lying about seeing
Coffey murder this guy?

35:33.506 --> 35:34.549
I can't tell you more.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.634
You know that privilege applies.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.303
Counselor, what are you pulling,
some kind of phony delay?

35:39.595 --> 35:42.014
Look, just represent him another hour.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.516
I've got pressure on me, Joyce.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.518
You'll resign right after he testifies,
all right?

35:46.644 --> 35:47.478
No.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.523
What's going on?

35:50.898 --> 35:52.358
Uh, if I'm not cross-eyed,

35:52.441 --> 35:54.861
Ms. Davenport has just preserved
the lawyer-client privilege

35:54.944 --> 35:57.405
while informing the district attorney
that my client is innocent.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.198
I wouldn't go that far.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.408
How far would you go?

36:00.491 --> 36:02.493
Come on, Alvarez.
If it was anything but perjury,

36:02.577 --> 36:04.412
she could have stuck around another hour.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.789
Crockett was gonna go in there,
commit a crime. She walked away.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.583
FRANK: Let's quit dancing, Alvarez.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.209
(sighs) All right.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.547
In conscience, the inference
I draw is that Crockett's lying.

36:17.049 --> 36:18.342
No grand jury for now.

36:19.844 --> 36:20.678
Okay.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.268
Am I okay?

36:27.685 --> 36:29.604
Well, better than you were
five minutes ago.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.732
Looks like we licked him
on the criminal charges.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.901
What about<i> him?</i>
He's the one who should be charged!

36:34.984 --> 36:38.112
Okay, look. We got a good case, okay?
I'm gonna hustle down to Michaels' court,

36:38.196 --> 36:39.989
see if I can pick up anything else, huh?

36:40.531 --> 36:42.700
-Hey, thanks a lot, Sam.
-Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.285
-Go slow for me.
-Mm-hmm.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.120
How do you feel?

36:47.121 --> 36:48.581
(sighs) I'm okay.

36:49.916 --> 36:50.750
I'm mad.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.421
I'd say it's a hurdle overcome.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.468
No, it's more like
I just started out on a marathon.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.596
I mean, isn't that what she did?
They can't use that, right?

37:03.888 --> 37:06.015
Her letting the D.A. know
that Crockett was gonna lie.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.558
That's privileged communication.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.727
But people are still gonna think
that I did it.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.270
Some will, sure.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.356
And I could still get sued.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.983
Joe, look, I've always thought of you
as a survivor.

37:16.067 --> 37:16.943
If you're gonna survive this,

37:17.026 --> 37:18.653
you're gonna have to do it
one day at a time.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.238
You start chewing
at all the possibilities--

37:20.321 --> 37:22.281
No, I'm gonna survive. I'll survive.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.243
I'm gonna go home tonight
and figure out my future.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.745
I hope you're not considering
leaving the force.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.497
I'm not gonna resign.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.042
I just know I'm a good cop, Captain.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.294
It's just so damn unfair.

37:39.215 --> 37:44.136

All I had to hear was who's managing him.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.955
the blind leading the unmentionable.

38:11.330 --> 38:14.125
We got strict financial oversight,
Mrs. Schnitz!

Hey, Vic! Hey, Vic!

(cymbal crashes)

39:02.715 --> 39:03.716
All right, all right.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.218
Thank you very much
for that moving introduction.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.762
-(drum thumps)
-Remind me to use you

39:07.845 --> 39:09.347
next time I apply for a loan, all right?

39:09.430 --> 39:12.600
That's it. Good. All right, here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:13.559 --> 39:14.393
(chuckles nervously)

39:16.771 --> 39:19.023
What is this, a convention of monks,
or did someone just say "E.F. Hutton"?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.274
I don't know what we're doing here.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.442
(laughter)

39:22.360 --> 39:23.986
Excuse me, do you know anything
about real estate at all?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.572
Anything? A little bit?
Tell me, is this a lot?

39:26.655 --> 39:29.367
-I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
-(laughter)

39:30.701 --> 39:32.495
-I didn't mean that, all right?
(laughter)

39:32.578 --> 39:33.954
Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.375
(imitating Rod Serling)
Submitted for your consideration,

39:38.125 --> 39:42.338
aging entertainer on a one-way ticket
to comedy hell.

39:42.421 --> 39:44.340
(laughs)

39:44.423 --> 39:46.258
(in normal voice) Anyway,
it's an honor and a pleasure

39:46.342 --> 39:48.552
-to be working here at-- Where am I?
-J.D.: Eugene's!

39:48.636 --> 39:51.472
Thank you! Eugene's.
Right, it's Eugene's, isn't it?

39:51.889 --> 39:54.266
Well, maybe not an honor,
but at least it gets me out of the house.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.851
-You know what I mean?
-(laughter)

39:56.894 --> 39:59.355
I mean, not that I don't have
an absolutely lovely wife.

40:00.022 --> 40:01.899
Why, just last week, she got a mud pack
at the beauty shop.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.235
Looked terrific for three days.
Then the mud came off.

40:04.318 --> 40:07.863
Went back the next day, spent over $500,
and that was just for the estimate.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.533
J.D.: If Ed Sullivan was alive! Oh!

40:10.616 --> 40:13.202
Seriously. I told her this morning,
I said, "Sasquatch--"

40:13.285 --> 40:16.580
Uh, no, come on! Come on, seriously.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.582
(clears throat) Oh...

40:19.583 --> 40:22.920
Oh, payday at my house
is like the Academy Awards.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.922
My wife says, "May I have
the envelope, please?"

40:26.632 --> 40:29.969
I've been married for ten years. I'm still
in love with the same wonderful woman,

40:30.219 --> 40:32.471
and if my wife ever finds out,
she's gonna kill me.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.641
(coughs nervously)

40:36.350 --> 40:38.144
(scattered laughter)

40:45.317 --> 40:47.820
What is the, uh,
the, uh, sleeping routine here?

40:48.154 --> 40:50.698
Pure improvisational genius.

40:51.782 --> 40:55.202
-(microphone thuds)
-Oh, yes, sir, do you know what?

40:55.703 --> 40:56.871
(laughs)

40:58.330 --> 41:00.166
I just came back from a pleasure trip.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.334
I took my mother-in-law to the airport.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.086
(laughter)

41:07.298 --> 41:09.633
Last week, I told her, I said,
"My house is your house."

41:09.717 --> 41:12.678
-Two days later, she sold it.
-(laughter)

41:14.096 --> 41:15.139
(laughs)

41:17.725 --> 41:19.143
Huh? (laughs)

41:19.226 --> 41:20.644
Oh, boy.

41:22.229 --> 41:25.024
Last week, my brother-in-law-- (laughs)

41:25.107 --> 41:27.193
what a character he is, I'll tell you.

41:27.568 --> 41:28.861
Last week, uh,

41:28.944 --> 41:31.530
I asked him what he was doing
wearing my trench coat. (chuckles)

41:31.614 --> 41:34.033
He says, "You wouldn't want me
to get your new suit wet, would you?"

41:34.116 --> 41:35.701
(laughter)

41:38.370 --> 41:39.830
(laughter dies)

41:41.790 --> 41:44.168
(laughing)

41:44.919 --> 41:47.546
That sleeping routine's rather amusing.

41:50.508 --> 41:51.717
-MAN: I don't get it.
-Yeah.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.305
J.D.:
He's, uh, carrying it too far, though.

41:59.058 --> 41:59.892
Vic!

42:01.519 --> 42:03.479
Vic! Come on, Vic!

42:04.104 --> 42:05.773
-(feedback)
-J.D.: Vic!

42:06.607 --> 42:08.108
-(snoring)
-J.D.: Vic!

42:08.192 --> 42:11.028
-But seriously, folks, my brother--
-Save it, Vic.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.617
(cries)

42:19.119 --> 42:20.913
(sighs) Did I go out?

42:21.413 --> 42:22.248
You went out.

42:24.708 --> 42:27.211
Is there something
you want to tell me, Vic?

42:28.963 --> 42:30.464
Looks like you already found out.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.883
What the hell's the matter with you?

42:33.509 --> 42:34.468
Narcolepsy.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.763
I swear to you, J.D.,
I thought I had it licked.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.724
I cooked short-order
four years in St. Louis.

42:40.808 --> 42:45.145
They had this clinic, and, uh,
they were giving me treatments.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.859
They said I was cured, 40 percent chance.

42:50.943 --> 42:54.238
Vic Hitler, the narcoleptic comic.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.741
-Was I out long?
-Long enough.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.745
J.D., is there any way
I can make it up to you,

43:02.788 --> 43:04.039
you and your beautiful guys?

43:05.916 --> 43:07.293
Vic Hitler...

43:08.544 --> 43:11.088
the narcoleptic comic.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.343
What went on?

43:16.427 --> 43:19.513
Two perpetrators held up a liquor store
one block east of here on Utica.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.598
Owner called it in.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.975
Officer Hardy and Welsh responded,

43:23.225 --> 43:25.394
chased them into this warehouse
where the shootout occurred.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.230
Hardy's in ICU.
One of the perpetrators was killed.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.148
And the other?

43:29.732 --> 43:31.650
He was apprehended
by your day guy, Belker.

43:31.734 --> 43:33.611
He was driving nearby,
and he called it in.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.613
What about the perpetrators? Black, white?

43:35.696 --> 43:37.698
-White.
-Where's Belker?

43:38.824 --> 43:40.492
(siren wailing)

43:53.547 --> 43:57.009
(indistinct chatter over police radio)

44:00.387 --> 44:02.931
I-- I was just driving around,
and I heard it on the radio,

44:03.015 --> 44:06.852
so I-- I just came over. I don't know.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.104
You okay?

44:11.815 --> 44:12.650
I'm fine.

44:14.568 --> 44:15.444
Your mother?

44:16.278 --> 44:17.279
She's okay.

44:17.529 --> 44:18.906
In fact, I gave her a sedative.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.160
Captain, I heard you got married today.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.788
I'm very happy for you.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.456
Sorry you had to come out tonight.

44:28.082 --> 44:30.834
That's okay. You have someplace to go,
Mick? Where's Robin?

44:32.920 --> 44:34.004
How'd you know about that?

44:35.005 --> 44:36.840
Precinct's a hard place to keep a secret.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.676
Yeah, I guess so.

44:40.969 --> 44:42.096
I don't know, Captain.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.765
I've been with people all day.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.643
I just wanted to get out by myself
for a while.

44:49.895 --> 44:50.729
You want to talk?

44:52.523 --> 44:53.357
I'm okay.

45:00.906 --> 45:02.658
You should have known my dad, Captain.

45:05.327 --> 45:09.998
Last few months, he wasn't really himself,
but he used to be something else.

45:11.166 --> 45:14.044
(chuckles) You think<i> I </i>can bite?

45:15.754 --> 45:19.049
Once when I was five years old,
I saw my dad get into a fight

45:19.133 --> 45:22.094
with a guy that was about
the size of a Mack truck,

45:23.262 --> 45:25.556
and my dad was a little guy just like me.

45:27.057 --> 45:30.018
He took a bite on this hairball's arm,

45:30.352 --> 45:32.020
and he held on for life,

45:32.354 --> 45:35.774
and this big guy is shaking his arm
up and down, up and down,

45:35.858 --> 45:38.527
and my dad is going
right up and down with him. (chuckles)

45:41.989 --> 45:44.324
He was one tough little guy, my old man.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.495
I'm gonna miss him a lot.

45:53.917 --> 45:54.752
Uh...

45:56.253 --> 45:57.421
can I buy you a cup of coffee?

45:59.465 --> 46:02.259
You know what you should do?
You should go home to your missus.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.678
I'll see you at work tomorrow morning.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.431
You sure?

47:00.818 --> 47:03.153
Think we're going to lose
the romance, Furillo?

47:03.821 --> 47:06.365
Mm-mm. I don't think so.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.034
I don't know.

47:09.868 --> 47:12.704
We've got all this
disgusting respectability.

47:13.121 --> 47:14.289
Trust me, Joyce.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.042
-(chuckles)
-We're doing all right so far.

47:19.711 --> 47:21.672
We're going to do things, Frank.

47:22.881 --> 47:23.715
Amen.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.634
(laughs) No.

47:26.510 --> 47:30.180
Let's travel, hmm? Europe? Japan?

47:31.682 --> 47:34.142
-Let's redecorate my apartment.
-Let's live within our means.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.060
We will.

47:37.604 --> 47:39.690
I'm going to love being married to you.

47:42.776 --> 47:43.652
Mrs. Furillo?

47:47.114 --> 47:48.574
You suppose I could have a kiss?

47:49.950 --> 47:51.785
The name's Davenport, pizza man.

47:54.955 --> 47:55.789
Really?

47:57.207 --> 47:58.041
Really.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.089
I can live with that.

48:32.659 --> 48:35.662
