00:01.042 --> 00:03.294
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.378 --> 00:04.421
Bingo.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.632
The Black Arrow is damn near
up to brigade strength, man.

00:07.716 --> 00:08.925
Blood is gonna run.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.511
It took us ten months to wire Virgil
into the Black Arrow.

00:11.594 --> 00:12.595
I don't want to lose him now.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.682
The other night, you arrested
a young woman, Susan Downey.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.726
She claims you propositioned her

00:17.809 --> 00:19.894
and threatened to arrest her
if she didn't comply.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.982
I haven't been with a man
since my husband left over a year ago.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.650
I can't. I'm a married man.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.402
It doesn't matter.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.779
Kiss it all goodbye, Phil.

00:30.155 --> 00:34.075
The midnight loofah lessons,
the omelets au naturel.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.077
Are you trying to ask me
for a date, Howard?

00:36.703 --> 00:37.537
Yes.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.955
Why the long face, huh?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.916
Oh, I don't know.
It's been kind of a rough week.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.837
Uh, anything that a weekend
of fishin' wouldn't cure?

00:45.920 --> 00:48.923
What's the matter, hairball?
Your panty hose on too tight?

00:50.967 --> 00:51.801
I'll call you.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
Always the popular one, counselor.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.806
I'm at liberty to be so these days.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.268
What if I were to tell you that you didn't
have to send alimony anymore?

01:00.727 --> 01:01.853
You're getting married?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.104
Yeah.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.318
(clicks tongue) Mind if I come in?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.324
(chattering)

01:14.407 --> 01:17.202
(loud yawning)

01:19.120 --> 01:21.831
(chattering)

01:26.753 --> 01:31.549
Please be reminded that this creature's
material evidence in a criminal case

01:31.633 --> 01:34.844
and, as such, is due all rights
and privileges of a ward of the court.

01:35.678 --> 01:39.099
Uh, said rights and privileges,
however, do not include

01:39.265 --> 01:42.018
happy hour guest appearances
at Madigan's Bar and Grill.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.269
(laughing)

01:43.353 --> 01:48.858
Midnight forays to Mike's Submarines,
nor unauthorized overnights

01:48.942 --> 01:51.444
at the homes of certain unnamed officers.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.905
-(man clears throat)
-(laughing)

01:53.988 --> 01:55.740
Glad to see you're datin' again, Mick.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.995
(all laughing)

02:02.163 --> 02:03.540
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.959
All right, come on, eyes front.
We're almost through.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.796
Item 15, regarding arms
and munitions missing

02:09.879 --> 02:14.300
from the National Guard Armory in Newark
that was hit two weekends ago--

02:15.385 --> 02:19.597
As you're all probably aware by now,
said weaponry was located last week

02:19.681 --> 02:23.059
by several of our people
in a warehouse off Niagara Street.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.562
Though we haven't, as yet,
established any solid links,

02:25.645 --> 02:29.941
the present investigation is proceeding
on the, uh, premise of gang activity.

02:30.024 --> 02:34.070
More specifically, that of
Jesse John Hudson and the Black Arrow.

02:34.612 --> 02:38.950
Now, with this in mind, people,
let's keep our antenna tuned, shall we?

02:39.742 --> 02:42.829
All right, the last item brings us

02:42.912 --> 02:46.833
to the annual precincts'
small-arms qualifications

02:47.000 --> 02:49.711
at the Westside Academy
Firing Range tomorrow.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.671
(moaning, chattering)

02:51.754 --> 02:53.882
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:54.841 --> 02:59.220
without recapitulating last year's
embarrassingly substandard performance,

02:59.304 --> 03:04.809
I think you're all aware that
a 57.4 overall accuracy percentage

03:04.893 --> 03:07.687
-does not a crack team make.
-See that? Forget it.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.898
Now, believe me, it's gonna take
a sight better effort than that

03:09.981 --> 03:13.526
to wrest the Kubiak Memorial Trophy
away from that gloating bunch at Midtown

03:13.610 --> 03:15.612
and back to its rightful home upstairs!

03:15.695 --> 03:18.865
(cheering)

03:18.948 --> 03:20.617
So let's be prepared for this one.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.578
And that means,
a good eight hours' sleep tonight

03:24.495 --> 03:28.917
and, uh, a little uncommon temperance
in the beer and, uh, gender department.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.711
(chattering, chuckling)

03:31.794 --> 03:34.422
-All right. That's it. Let's roll.
-(clamoring)

03:34.505 --> 03:37.258
Oh, wait a second!
We're not through here just yet!

03:39.344 --> 03:44.891
Uh, "uncognizant" as I am
of who among you is responsible,

03:44.974 --> 03:48.686
nevertheless, in deference
to our more female coworkers,

03:48.770 --> 03:54.025
I'd like to express my profound dismay
at the peephole discovered.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.360
(men laughing)

03:55.443 --> 03:58.029
Earlier this morning,
channeled from the men's lavatory

03:58.112 --> 03:59.280
into the ladies' powder room.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.616
No. No!

04:01.699 --> 04:04.285
Now, aside from the obvious
vandalistic overtones,

04:04.744 --> 04:07.372
I find this sort of behavior deviant.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.123
-WOMAN: Thank you.
-In the extreme.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.167
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.711
And hey, hey! Let's be careful out there.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.088
These idiots.

04:16.714 --> 04:21.844
(chattering)

04:21.928 --> 04:23.721
I was adjusting my damn bra.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.184
What would you do if you were
in your little jockstrap or something

04:28.268 --> 04:30.144
and there's some weirdo looking at you
through a hole in the wall--

04:30.228 --> 04:34.232
Wait, what makes you so sure that the hole
was drilled in the ladies' direction?

04:34.857 --> 04:38.861
Man, I've been practicing on tin cans
on a country fence, Lee Van Cleef style.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.863
Draw! (imitating gunfire)

04:40.947 --> 04:42.407
Trust me, this year is gonna be different.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.119
That's right, because this year,
you're gonna lose someone else's money.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.829
Stay with me, oh, my brother.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.706
Uh, Joe?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.918
You think I might be able to interest you
in a small wager

04:54.002 --> 04:56.921
on the qualifications
in shooting tomorrow?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.756
Oh, I don't know. What'd you have in mind?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.801
Well, maybe a small tag team
shootin' match between partners.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.845
Let's say me and Bobby here
against you and Lucille.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.097
-Dollar a point.
-JOE: Dollar a point? I'm al--

05:06.180 --> 05:07.223
Dollar a point!

05:07.307 --> 05:10.435
Best lead per volley,
uh, double for bull's-eyes,

05:10.518 --> 05:13.563
maybe a five-dollar Nassau with an option
to press in the second half.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.814
Bates, Coffey!

05:15.231 --> 05:17.650
I got a neighborly squabble
for you on East Ferry.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.778
Yeah, right there, Sarge. Uh, you're on.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.614
Joe, uh, I think we
gotta think about this.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.200
-Money in the bank, Luce.
-I gotta talk to you.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.662
-Yeah! Your money, my bank!
-Hey, watch it.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.172
HANKS: Hill Street.
Officer Hanks speaking.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.592
(clattering)

05:46.471 --> 05:48.890
-Judas Priest! Hah!
-(man laughing)

05:49.265 --> 05:51.809
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Dispatch. </i>
<i>We have a 9-11. </i>

05:51.893 --> 05:53.603
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:57.899
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:08.534
(theme music playing)

07:18.980 --> 07:19.981
I don't know.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.068
You can do a little
girl-watching per se, but, uh,

07:24.902 --> 07:28.156
you would have to be seriously whacked
to go to all this trouble.

07:28.239 --> 07:33.536
Frank, it's just indicative
of the goldarn cancer of permissiveness

07:33.619 --> 07:35.788
that you have allowed
to take root up here.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.624
Morning, Howard.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.294
What's indicative?

07:41.752 --> 07:44.380
Oh, Judas Priest, man. Open your eyes.

07:44.839 --> 07:49.010
This precinct is virtually a petri dish
of laxity and insubordination,

07:50.052 --> 07:55.308
not to mention chronic irreverence
for the art of small-arms marksmanship.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.729
Howard, the men make bets every year
on range qualifications.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.481
Oh, wow.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.609
FURILLO: So, how'd your evening go
with Grace Gardner?

08:06.944 --> 08:09.530
Just fine. Wonderful, in fact.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.282
Couldn't have gone better.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.911
-Why? What did you hear?
-Nothing, Howard.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.956
But you're looking a little ragged
around the edges this morning.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.342
Could I be totally frank

08:30.843 --> 08:31.677
with you, Frank?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.514
Of course, Howard.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.601
HUNTER: The woman's deranged.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.729
Frank, you know me.

08:42.396 --> 08:45.233
I am not a rookie
when it comes to night maneuvers.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.735
I mean, libidinally speaking,

08:48.277 --> 08:51.781
I have been known to snap
a few wet towels in my time.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.493
(chuckles) But this Gardner woman--

08:56.536 --> 08:58.996
I mean, she is a case for the manuals.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.458
Frank. (inhales)

09:03.084 --> 09:05.253
She heats up her body lotion

09:06.212 --> 09:07.713
in her microwave.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.802
I mean, Judas Priest!

09:13.344 --> 09:17.306
How is any right-thinking male
supposed to keep his powder dry

09:17.390 --> 09:21.769
under that kind of ungodly
erotogenic pressure?

09:25.815 --> 09:28.734
Howard, if you're trying to tell me
you experienced a little

09:29.360 --> 09:31.070
momentary equipment failure--

09:31.529 --> 09:33.239
I don't care what you've heard, Frank.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.491
My equipment is as good as any man's,

09:35.783 --> 09:38.119
and I don't wish to discuss this
any further.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.082
Please, Mrs. Santilia,
just try and stay calm.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.959
Two of our officers
should be there any minute.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.795
(man shouting)

09:47.878 --> 09:51.507
Bates, Coffey, I thought you were
on that call to East Ferry.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.718
-Well...
-We were, Sarge.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.262
Until we found these shrimps
ripping off our radio.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.097
Yeah, in the parking lot
in broad daylight.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.933
My, my, aren't we ambitious
early in the morning?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.894
In your nose, Grandpa!
Your mama swims after troop ships!

10:03.978 --> 10:04.812
-Watch it!
-All right,

10:04.895 --> 10:07.356
put 'em in Holding for the time being.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.067
-Come on, all three of you!
-Radio Hill and Renko--

10:13.404 --> 10:15.865
Those kids are members
of the Dragon, Frank.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.283
Former members, it appears.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.910
You really think they've thrown in
with the Black Arrow?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.162
I think they'd like to, Ray.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.372
And if they're any indication
of what's going on out there,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.916
I'd say we have some serious trouble
coming our way.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.834
GOLDBLUME: Frank?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.546
Frank, I have wasted
nearly the entire damn morning

10:30.630 --> 10:31.714
going through those warehouse files.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.090
Yeah, I know, Henry.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.636
It was a good try, but I figured
that warrant would turn out to be a bust.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.098
Fake waybills,
phony addresses and names, yes?

10:41.349 --> 10:44.477
Well, how can someone stash over
half a ton of hot armory and hardware

10:44.560 --> 10:46.145
without leaving some kind of trail?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.148
Well, we didn't expect Hudson
to make things easy for us.

10:49.857 --> 10:50.691
So what now?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.278
Just so your morning
won't be a complete washout,

10:55.321 --> 10:59.241
uh, what say we drop some citations on
that warehouse for creative bookkeeping?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.621
Oh, and see if you can raise
Belker for me, would you?

11:03.704 --> 11:04.538
Yeah.

11:04.622 --> 11:10.336
Two hours a day I spend in my garden,
weeding, pruning, watering.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.088
(shouting) But what do they care?

11:13.714 --> 11:17.385
They play their radios
and collect their welfare checks.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.805
And they don't care about nothing!

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
-You are uncivilized!
-(shouting)

11:23.182 --> 11:26.018
-You have no culture!
-HILL: Calm down.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.020
If he doesn't hand it over,
I'm gonna go up there and get it myself.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.356
He's the one that's always on my property!

11:30.439 --> 11:31.649
Mr. Popovich, please.

11:31.732 --> 11:32.983
Mr. Popovich, calm down.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.821
How am I supposed to do my job
if you all don't shut up?

11:36.904 --> 11:38.572
Mr. Popovich, please, just calm down.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.200
You're gonna cause a ri--
Mr. Popovich, calm down.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.743
Thirty-five years I live here.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.747
And I won't be chased out
by these animals!

11:46.831 --> 11:49.375
I don't care if you're a man or a woman!
Shut up!

11:49.458 --> 11:51.419
-Yo, Bobby.
-We are not animals.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.089
You know I hate to start off a shift
with these nickel-and-dime beefs.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.507
You think I like it, Renko?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.260
Look, the old guy claims that the kid

11:59.343 --> 12:01.262
stomped half his marigolds
chasing the ball.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.724
Ah, heavens, marigolds and soccer balls.
Ain't that terrible?

12:04.807 --> 12:07.184
You wonder why I'm so hot
to get into plainclothes?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.186
Will you be quiet? Thank you very much!

12:09.520 --> 12:11.355
Now, I think we just oughta negotiate

12:11.439 --> 12:14.191
some kind of unilateral agreement
and get the hell out of here.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.359
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.819
The old guy's gonna need
some kind of token damages--

12:16.902 --> 12:19.989
I think I can squeeze a fin
out of the San Juan contingent.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.032
How do you, uh, say "five dollars"?

12:22.992 --> 12:25.327
<i>-Cinco dólares.</i>
<i>-Cinco dólares.</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:26.746
Okay, Mr. Popovich.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.664
-HILL: It's gonna be settled.
<i>-Cinco dólares Americano.</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:35.004
-Nice negotiations.
-Y'all keep a leash on this ball, boy.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.757
Get out now. Go home. Go home.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.133
-(Hill groaning)
-Go wherever it is you live.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.886
Don't hang around,
bother this old man anymore.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.600
You know, he's got an awful lot
of anger stored up in him.

12:47.975 --> 12:48.809
Well, can you blame him?

12:48.893 --> 12:51.395
How would you feel if your
home turf was being invaded

12:51.479 --> 12:53.647
by a bunch of ill-mannered foreigners?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.233
I wouldn't know, cowboy.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.237
(dispatcher on radio, indistinct)

13:06.076 --> 13:07.411
Hudson's called an emergency meet

13:07.495 --> 13:09.538
of the Weapons Committee
for three o'clock.

13:10.831 --> 13:12.666
Look, I wanna go in there
with a wire, man.

13:13.334 --> 13:17.004
Forget it, Virgil, let's just wait and see
what the warehouse bust gives us.

13:17.087 --> 13:17.922
Nothin'.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.840
That's what it's gonna give us.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.969
Look, man, I've been under
on this operation for nearly nine months.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.930
We don't move now, it's gonna be too late.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.934
Just tell Furillo.
Tell him I want a wire, all right?

13:31.477 --> 13:32.978
-Hit me.
-What?

13:33.062 --> 13:35.564
Don't turn around.
Just hit me, damn it. Hit me now!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.399
(bottles clattering)

13:37.858 --> 13:39.568
Hey, what's happening, Virgil?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.863
Hey, Clay, uh, just cleanin' up
the neighborhood, man.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.448
-That right?
-Yeah.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.159
Stinkin' wino tried
to hit me for my lunch money.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.329
What? Say.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.497
-Look here, boy.
-(grunts)

13:52.540 --> 13:56.293
This here's Black Arrow territory,
owned and operated.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.462
No riffraff allowed.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.631
-Especially white riffraff.
-(grunts)

14:00.714 --> 14:03.175
CLAY (laughing):
Come on. Let's hit it, bro.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.093
MAN: Yeah.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.886
-(groans)
-Come on.

14:06.762 --> 14:07.847
(laughing)

14:11.517 --> 14:12.685
(moans)

14:21.443 --> 14:22.653
(door opening)

14:31.453 --> 14:32.997
-You okay?
-Yeah.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.127
I just got this from Division, Mick.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.839
Three positive IDs off those prints
Virgil got from Hudson's inner circle.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.382
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.510
One of them's an ex-Green Beret
named Jenkins

14:46.594 --> 14:47.887
who's wanted for manslaughter in Oakland.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.598
The other two, Tabbs and Ferris,
did some time in Michigan.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.934
You figure we can, uh,
bust Hudson on a parole beef?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.060
Uh-huh.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.478
Consorting with known felons.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.649
We stand an excellent chance if we can get
Virgil into that meeting with a wire.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.193
Captain, these Black Arrow guys
play for keeps.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.361
They waste people.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.614
I'm aware of that, Mick.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.909
So is Virgil,
or he wouldn't want them so badly.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.786
Captain, Virgil is such a gung-ho type.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.291
Why can't we wait
till something sure comes along?

15:19.668 --> 15:21.503
Okay, I'll have him
wired up this afternoon.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.298
I just wanted you to know that
I don't feel good about the whole thing.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.634
I know you don't, Mick. Neither do I.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.228
-Phillip.
-Howard.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.398
It seems I've drained
the last of the java.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.610
I trust there's no hard feelings, Phil.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.697
Of course not, Howard.
I'll just, uh, brew a fresh pot.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.661
I was referring to our situation
vis-à-vis the Gardner woman.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.079
Rest easy, Howard.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.831
Our estrangement is quite unconditional.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.751
Orthopedically speaking,
it couldn't have come too soon.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.878
(chuckles)

16:03.587 --> 16:07.675
Yeah, well, after last night's soirée,
I couldn't concur with you more.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.884
Why? What happened last night?

16:10.302 --> 16:13.722
Nothing, Phil.
(chuckles) Absolutely nothing.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.432
Well, congratulations, Howard.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.977
In view of the woman's insatiable needs,

16:18.602 --> 16:21.855
that must qualify as an all-time first.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.151
Doggone it, Phil.

16:26.235 --> 16:30.197
I have proven myself a first-rate nimrod
from Dartmouth to Da Nang,

16:30.406 --> 16:33.993
and I'll be damned if I'll be crucified
for one wet squib.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.577
(mug clatters)

16:36.161 --> 16:38.539
-How've you been, Howard?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.460
-What's eating him?
-Well, Fay...

16:43.544 --> 16:47.047
To put it bluntly, Grace Gardner.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.384
Grace Gardner? With Howard Hunter?

16:50.467 --> 16:52.970
Mm-hmm.
Fate makes strange bedfellows of us all.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.141
Only two weeks ago, I never imagined
I'd be seeing Margaret again.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.976
-Your ex-wife Margaret?
-Mm-hmm.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.311
I stopped over to help her
install her storm windows

17:01.770 --> 17:03.230
and ended up staying for dinner.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.943
After six months on the carnal frontiers
with Grace Gardner,

17:08.277 --> 17:12.489
you've no idea what a joy it is
to spend the night with a woman--

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
just sleeping.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.745
-That's called "domesticity," Phil.
-(Phil chuckling)

17:17.828 --> 17:19.705
Oh. Hiya, Mac. What's the good word?

17:19.788 --> 17:23.083
Well, it's four centerline tickets
for the Sabre game.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.961
Oh, great!
Oh, I'd like you to meet Fay Furillo.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.087
-How do you do, Fay?
-Hello.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.964
-You're the captain's missus?
-Former.

17:29.298 --> 17:33.385
Oh, well, in that case, Fay,
do you like contact sports?

17:34.428 --> 17:36.805
Is your friend aware
that he's propositioning a woman

17:36.889 --> 17:38.766
engaged to be married in ten days?

17:38.849 --> 17:41.727
No! Well, who's the lucky fellow?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.145
His name is Hal Massey.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.898
Oh, he's running for reelection
for the school board.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.485
Oh, nice going, Fay.
You finally bagged a live one.

17:50.069 --> 17:50.944
Phil!

17:51.028 --> 17:53.822
-(laughing)
-Francis must be happy as a clam.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.034
Well, he is.
And, in fact, that's why I came by today.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.578
I want to invite you both
to the reception.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.206
Oh, thank you. How civilized.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.584
And congratulations.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.377
Thank you, Phil.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.256
Say hi to Margaret for me, okay?

18:11.757 --> 18:14.176
-It was nice meeting you, Mac.
-The pleasure was totally mine, Fay.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.887
-I'm just sorry it didn't happen sooner.
-(laughs)

18:16.970 --> 18:17.930
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.599
(Mac groaning)

18:20.682 --> 18:23.102
Oh, Phil! (chuckling)

18:26.396 --> 18:29.775
And so the women come and go,
speaking of Michelangelo.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.569
(chuckles) Chin up, MacAllister.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.572
Amour-wise,
it's a wide and woolly world out there.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.741
(chuckling)

18:38.826 --> 18:39.827
(tapping on window)

18:42.746 --> 18:44.998
-Can I see you for a minute, Captain?
-Sure. Come on in.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.294
I was wondering if you knew
what was going on in this Downey case.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.880
They make a deal with the D.A. or what?

18:52.798 --> 18:53.841
Not to my knowledge.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.009
You know, it's a hell of a thing, Frank.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.556
You nail some drugged-out,
two-buck mattress buster,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.058
and all of a sudden
they got you under a microscope.

19:04.726 --> 19:05.853
What can I tell you, Ben?

19:08.063 --> 19:11.900
You know, my wife's a great gal.
You'd love her, Frank.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.028
I've been on the vice squad
for almost five years now,

19:15.946 --> 19:17.823
and, you know, she hasn't squawked once.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.659
But even she's getting edgy.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.745
It's like having a sword over your head
or something.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.663
I know.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.875
But the department has to investigate
all charges against its officers.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.085
-You know that, too.
-Yeah, I guess.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.963
So just go about your business,

19:33.547 --> 19:35.716
and I'll keep you apprised
of what happens, okay?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.094
(sighs)

19:40.220 --> 19:42.306
Thanks, Frank. I mean it.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.149
(clears throat)

19:54.234 --> 19:55.235
How are you, Joyce?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.030
Fine. Yourself?

19:59.281 --> 20:00.490
Sitting on a rainbow.

20:01.408 --> 20:02.242
That's good.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.581
What can I do for you?

20:16.632 --> 20:19.509
I've just come back from the D.A.'s office
about Susan Downey.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.429
Mm-hmm.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.931
They're looking to plea-bargain.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.601
Assistant D.A. Ramsey, I believe it was,

20:27.684 --> 20:31.772
said they'd reduce charges if we wouldn't
press our Ben Lambert complaint.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.942
I couldn't figure out why
they'd give a damn about Ben Lambert

20:35.025 --> 20:36.193
at this stage of the game,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.028
unless you talked to them.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.822
I reviewed the case with them, yes.

20:41.156 --> 20:45.077
Well, I told your Mr. Ramsey no deal.
We fight all the way.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.288
You have to do what you think is right,
counselor.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.961
Frank, I need an objective viewpoint,

20:54.795 --> 20:55.879
an opinion I value.

20:57.631 --> 20:58.799
Come on. I'll buy you a hot dog.

21:11.019 --> 21:15.524
Dispatch, we got a replay on that
neighbor squabble on East Ferry.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.192
What say let's send Hill and Renko out

21:17.276 --> 21:19.653
to domesticate the situation
once and for all?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.948
Tell me about Lambert. What's he like?

21:23.115 --> 21:25.909
Good cop.
Not exceptional, but good. Solid.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.954
-He's a family man. Clean record.
-That's it?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.873
Those are a lot better credentials
than Susan Downey's.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.127
You know, job description
of topless waitress

21:35.210 --> 21:37.671
does not exactly generate
a lot of character references.

21:40.048 --> 21:43.468
Frank, I really ran the number on her.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.348
Women's rights.
The importance of assertion.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.976
Her rights and responsibilities
as an individual.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.519
The entire party line.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.439
She just sat there,
blown away by the big-shot lawyer,

21:55.522 --> 21:57.399
and all but delivered herself
into my hands.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.319
-So what's your problem?
-(bell tolling)

22:02.195 --> 22:06.908
Am I being so stiff-necked about my ideals
that I'm harming my client?

22:07.534 --> 22:09.328
I wouldn't call you stiff-necked,
counselor.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.704
As I recall, your neck's--

22:13.290 --> 22:15.709
Sorry. That wasn't exactly proper.

22:18.086 --> 22:22.549
(sighs) If she's telling the truth
and we take the deal,

22:24.509 --> 22:27.763
then Lambert gets swept under the carpet
without even a reprimand,

22:27.846 --> 22:29.890
and Susan Downey becomes
just another victim

22:29.973 --> 22:31.683
flushed down the system's toilet.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.269
Exactly right.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.023
But if you don't take the plea
and you lose--

22:38.607 --> 22:40.859
Then she's doing time,
and I'm kicking myself.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.236
But that's a given in every case.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.031
The point is, Susan Downey
should not have to be compromised,

22:46.114 --> 22:47.199
and neither should I.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.577
-What he did to her sickens me.
-If he's guilty.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.747
You wanna know something?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.458
Whether you win or lose,

22:57.959 --> 22:59.044
we're never gonna know,

23:00.087 --> 23:00.921
not for sure.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.432
How've you been, Frank? Really.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.310
I've been missing you.

23:17.145 --> 23:17.979
Me too.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.358
Joyce, I didn't dislike what we had.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.612
It just made me want so much more.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.450
There are men in my life who'd kill
to have what you had.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.914
I only wish it'd been enough for me.
It wasn't.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.214
Thanks for the hot dog, pizza man.

23:46.883 --> 23:49.094
(angry shouting)

23:49.177 --> 23:51.221
MAN: Old man, what are you gonna do
with that bat?

23:53.432 --> 23:54.599
Who do you want this time?

23:55.016 --> 23:58.895
Well, I'll take the white man,
and you take the third world.

23:58.979 --> 24:00.063
-Get out of my way, pal.
-Back off.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.231
Get out of my way, get out of my way.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.358
Let us through,
let us through, let us through.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.818
Now, I thought we cleaned this mess up.

24:04.901 --> 24:05.735
Stay away from me!

24:05.819 --> 24:09.448
-Hey, hey, hey, no problem.
-Now, you put that bat down.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.242
Do you have any idea
what the penalties are

24:12.325 --> 24:14.870
for wielding a bat like that
at an officer of the law?

24:14.953 --> 24:18.582
Tell them! Tell them!
Because they're all just animals!

24:18.832 --> 24:21.543
-Understand?
-My son was doing nothing!

24:21.626 --> 24:24.754
And this-- this animal came after him
calling him filthy names!

24:24.838 --> 24:27.090
Hey, do you expect me to believe
that he's the only one doing this?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.008
Come on.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.803
M-- Mr. Popovich,
we have got to talk about this.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.305
All I was doing was playing my tape deck

24:33.388 --> 24:35.348
-while I was waxing my brother's car, man.
-Okay, son, all right.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.727
These people are your neighbors,
whether you like it or not.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.271
Now look, I know how you feel--

24:42.063 --> 24:44.191
being the last white man
in the neighborhood and all.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.776
And if these jokers have committed
some kind of a crime--

24:46.860 --> 24:48.195
(chattering)

24:48.278 --> 24:49.946
-Shut up!
-WOMAN: There he goes!

24:50.030 --> 24:51.615
WOMAN: There he goes!
He's crazy, I told you.

24:51.698 --> 24:54.868
Get behind the fence. Behind the fence.
Everybody, behind the fence.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.120
Mr. Popovich, will you open up this door?

24:57.662 --> 25:00.832
Now, I'm-- I'm a police officer.
You're required by law--

25:01.541 --> 25:02.459
WOMAN: Now, you guys,
every time you always say--

25:02.542 --> 25:04.544
-Bobby...
-HILL: Behind the gate, everybody.

25:04.628 --> 25:07.005
Son, that's you, too. Behind the gate.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.675
Gun, Renko!

25:25.899 --> 25:27.943
(helicopter whirring)

25:30.195 --> 25:33.365
(siren blaring)

25:35.075 --> 25:36.993
GOLDBLUME: He's in the house
with a shotgun, Frank.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.080
Our guys are okay.
We got a wounded kid in the line of fire.

25:40.163 --> 25:42.207
Can't get to him.
We don't know if he's alive.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.251
There's been no motion from the house,

25:44.334 --> 25:46.878
and the old man hasn't responded
to the bullhorn.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.089
Hunter's setting up a field phone now
to contact him.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.300
-I got the paramedic.
-Can you tell if he's still alive?

25:52.592 --> 25:54.719
-I just got here.
-Well, work on it then, will you?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.472
<i>-</i>FRANK:<i> Henry.</i>
-I'm here, Frank.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.268
I got a number here for Popovich.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.520
FRANK:<i> 555-3501.</i>

26:04.271 --> 26:07.148
Hill? 555-3501.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.149
Right.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.403
This is Hunter at the scene,
acknowledging your circuit, Frank.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.363
We've secured the perimeters. Over.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.990
Outstanding, Howard.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.909
Henry, you tell me,
how do you want to handle this?

26:17.993 --> 26:19.911
As slow and easy as I can, Frank.

26:20.787 --> 26:23.832
Once we establish a line of dialog,
we can go in there and bring the boy out.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.918
Frank, Henry, one word, please.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.506
That boy has to be desanguinating
at a horrendous rate.

26:31.965 --> 26:35.844
HUNTER:<i> And I repeat,</i>
<i>we don't have the time for slow and easy.</i>

26:35.927 --> 26:39.264
Now just let my boys lay down
a little lead umbrella.

26:39.472 --> 26:43.893
We'll sweep right under, pick that boy up,
and presto-- home free.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.353
What do you think, Henry?

26:46.354 --> 26:47.314
Evacuation isn't complete.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.232
There's still people
in the surrounding buildings.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.484
Okay, that's out, Howard.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.988
Henry, all I can say is initiate contact
as quickly as possible.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.073
-Will do.
-HILL: It's ringing, Henry.

27:03.580 --> 27:04.664
But he's not picking up.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.501
MAN: Hey, Simmon, get down here!

27:09.628 --> 27:10.879
A waste of time, Henry.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.092
(sighs)

27:16.926 --> 27:18.136
Maybe you're right, Howard.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.806
Maybe just trying to talk to the man
is a waste of time.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.601
Hey, now your crosshairs are lining up.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.603
We'll deploy a strike force

27:26.686 --> 27:30.440
and use the new Cyclops urban warfare
grenade launcher.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.192
It'll be zappo, zilch.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.653
Please, Howard. No strike force, not yet.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.822
Joe, will you hand me that bullhorn
in the front seat?

27:37.906 --> 27:39.282
-JOE: Right, Lieutenant.
-How's the boy?

27:39.991 --> 27:40.992
PARAMEDIC: Can't tell.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.162
He hasn't moved in five,
maybe six minutes.

27:46.748 --> 27:47.582
<i>Mr. Popovich?</i>

27:49.125 --> 27:50.460
<i>My name is Henry Goldblume.</i>

27:52.587 --> 27:54.464
<i>I'm gonna come out there and get the boy.</i>

27:55.090 --> 27:56.257
Judas.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.426
HENRY:<i> I won't be armed. I'll come alone.</i>

27:59.010 --> 28:01.888
<i>I'll pick him up and bring him back here.</i>
<i>Okay, Mr. Popovich?</i>

28:06.101 --> 28:09.938
If the need arises, Henry,
you won't go down unanswered.

28:11.606 --> 28:12.774
Thanks a million, Howard.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.368
(helicopters whirring)

28:41.970 --> 28:45.056
-(siren blaring)
-Hey! Get out of here!

29:38.067 --> 29:40.945
WOMAN: Arturo! (sobbing)

29:41.029 --> 29:41.863
Arturo! (shouting)

29:44.866 --> 29:45.825
Arturo!

29:59.547 --> 30:02.425
(siren blaring)

30:02.509 --> 30:04.803
You really showed 'em
the size of your brass, Henry.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.263
I'm proud of you.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.433
The kid's dead, Howard.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.569
I don't know, Captain.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.114
Virgil was supposed
to show up at 2:00 for his wire.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.367
It's now almost 2:20.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.578
FURILLO:<i> You have any reason</i>
<i>to smell anything wrong, Mick?</i>

30:32.539 --> 30:33.456
Not really.

30:34.874 --> 30:37.752
Damn it. I didn't like this, Captain.
I told him we should pull out.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.587
I know you did, Mick. But for all we know,

30:39.671 --> 30:42.215
he went down to his car
and somebody boosted his battery.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.717
Let me go find him, Captain.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.635
No, no, no. Wait.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.971
Just ten more minutes.
If he doesn't show, then go after him.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.597
But be careful. Be careful.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.225
FURILLO:<i> Keep Ray apprised</i>
<i>of your whereabouts.</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:57.689
Do you think Virgil is all right?

30:58.022 --> 30:58.857
He's late.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.902
That's all.
There's nothing more to it, Ray.

31:04.153 --> 31:04.988
All right.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.949
HUDSON: There's one thing
you learn in the joint.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.201
Ain't no such thing as loyalty.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.915
Someone would always
sell you out for a price.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.796
So it didn't surprise me when someone
told 'em where we put the guns.

31:22.922 --> 31:26.301
The only question is, who?

31:30.305 --> 31:31.472
Was it you, Earl?

31:37.437 --> 31:40.231
(chuckling)

31:40.315 --> 31:42.191
No. (chuckling)

31:42.483 --> 31:44.944
I know this man since he was a little boy.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.990
Now, it had to be

31:50.450 --> 31:52.535
someone who was on the Weapons Committee

31:53.870 --> 31:57.749
or someone who was told by someone
on the Weapons Committee.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.256
Baby, when you lie down with traitors,
you are a traitor.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.675
I didn't know, Jesse.

32:09.010 --> 32:12.430
You sure must have pleased
this girl a whole lot.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.308
You made her betray the brotherhood.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.520
And when you betray the brotherhood,
you pay the price.

32:27.403 --> 32:28.905
I don't know who you are, boy.

32:30.698 --> 32:33.701
Maybe a cop. Maybe a fed.

32:34.953 --> 32:39.123
All I know is I got history
with these people.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.001
I ain't got nothing with you.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.467
(cocks gun)

32:52.887 --> 32:54.097
Afraid to die, Virgil?

32:56.766 --> 32:58.017
Are you holding it together?

32:59.978 --> 33:03.606
Or are your legs getting weak

33:04.565 --> 33:06.150
and your mouth going dry?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.028
Answer me, boy!

33:12.865 --> 33:13.825
You're gonna do it.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.452
You're gonna do it, do it.

33:17.286 --> 33:18.746
(spits) Do it!

33:22.208 --> 33:23.042
Oh, yeah,

33:25.253 --> 33:26.629
I'm gonna do it, Virgil.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.759
(chuckles) You know I'm gonna do it.

33:34.429 --> 33:35.304
Look at me, girl.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.433
You're weak, baby,

33:39.642 --> 33:41.978
and I will not tolerate weakness.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.187
(crying) No, Jesse!

33:43.271 --> 33:44.230
-(gunshot)
-No!

33:52.655 --> 33:53.656
(gun cocking)

33:59.746 --> 34:01.414
As far as I'm concerned,
it's cut-and-dried.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.707
With that boy dead,

34:02.790 --> 34:05.334
I suggest that we just
saturate that target with tear gas

34:05.418 --> 34:06.294
and drive him out of there.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.379
Let me try and make contact
with him one more time.

34:08.463 --> 34:12.341
(sighs) Henry, I am not insensitive
to your<i> humanitas,</i>

34:12.425 --> 34:15.678
but this is my operation,
and I think at this point in time--

34:15.887 --> 34:16.971
Mr. Popovich.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.724
Yeah, this is Sergeant Henry Goldblume.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.559
I'm the one who pulled the boy
off the street.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.146
Uh, look, Mr. Popovich,
I know how you must be feeling right now,

34:25.229 --> 34:28.107
and I thought maybe I'd come over there,
maybe we could talk about the situation.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.902
MR. POPOVICH:<i> Stay away from my house</i>
<i>if you want to live.</i>

34:31.277 --> 34:33.029
Mr. Popovich, I'm not your enemy.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.699
Let me come over there.
We can talk easier there.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.618
-MR. POPOVICH:<i> No. No.</i>
-I'm-- I'm coming over.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.703
-You can't.
-Great. He says he's gonna kill himself.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.164
-I can't give you approval to go in there.
-Howard.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.919
Henry, you are dealing with a demented,
suicidal psychopath.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.339
He's demonstrated his willingness
to kill people without provocation.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.342
-I'll keep that in mind, Howard.
-Oh, good.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.749
(door opens)

35:30.253 --> 35:31.295
Mr. Popovich?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.011
-Sit down.
-(clock ticking)

36:17.049 --> 36:18.342
What is your name?

36:18.426 --> 36:20.928
-Henry Goldblume, sir.
-Jew, huh?

36:22.763 --> 36:25.850
Well, pour yourself a drink.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.019
(sighs)

36:52.501 --> 36:54.462
(sighs) Well, Mr. Popovich,

36:55.671 --> 36:57.798
looks like we've got
a hell of a situation here.

36:59.759 --> 37:03.054
I thought maybe we should talk it through
before it gets any more out of hand.

37:03.429 --> 37:04.847
Nothing to talk about.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.976
I'm figuring to kill myself.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.899
You're Catholic, aren't you, Mr. Popovich?

37:14.982 --> 37:15.816
So?

37:16.609 --> 37:18.861
Suicide's a mortal sin, isn't it?
You go straight to hell.

37:18.945 --> 37:19.779
Shut up!

37:20.988 --> 37:23.741
I want a sermon, I'll go to mass.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.998
Do you have a family, Mr. Popovich?

37:31.874 --> 37:34.502
MR. POPOVICH: Had. Had a family.

37:35.253 --> 37:39.507
When Mary and me were raising up
our little ones,

37:39.924 --> 37:43.177
this was a nice neighborhood.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.224
I could send my daughter, Lebushka,

37:48.391 --> 37:52.270
down to the grocery store
for milk any time,

37:52.770 --> 37:54.355
day or night.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.654
There was this Polish bakery.

38:02.154 --> 38:06.075
They made fresh bread every day.

38:07.159 --> 38:11.706
You would bring it home
still warm from the oven.

38:12.623 --> 38:18.170
Now you go to the supermarket,
you pay $1.80-- for what?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.966
A loaf of chemical garbage.

38:23.426 --> 38:26.095
People used to keep up their places.

38:26.929 --> 38:27.763
Now?

38:28.264 --> 38:31.142
You got the niggers, and spics,

38:31.809 --> 38:35.187
and gypsies,
and there is garbage all over,

38:35.271 --> 38:38.649
and no one gives a damn about it anymore.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.067
No one.

38:41.319 --> 38:47.366
I see them going to the bathroom
in doorways, for God's sake.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.455
Nobody gives a damn

38:52.830 --> 38:54.749
about human life.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.251
Nobody.

38:59.462 --> 39:00.296
You know...

39:05.509 --> 39:10.264
they poisoned my dog. (sobbing)

39:13.517 --> 39:16.187
(sobbing) My dog.

39:17.688 --> 39:21.609
I found him right out front in my garden.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.194
HENRY: I'm sorry.

39:25.196 --> 39:29.200
Now you tell me, what's the sense?

39:29.992 --> 39:35.164
I work hard all my life,
and I hate it living like this!

39:37.166 --> 39:39.335
It doesn't have to be this way,
Mr. Popovich.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.672
They're gonna send me to the gas chamber

39:44.715 --> 39:46.634
for killing that boy.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.055
You didn't kill him.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.599
He's just wounded.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.521
Now, I'm gonna be straight
with you, Mr. Popovich.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.440
You'll probably have to go to jail
for a bit.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.525
No jail.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.151
Look around you.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.196
You're already in jail.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.825
You got three locks on the doors.
You got bars on the windows.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.451
You can't even go out after dark.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.538
Give yourself up, Mr. Popovich.

40:17.331 --> 40:22.253
I promise you, you'll go to
a-a minimum-security prison farm upstate.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.964
You could even have
your own garden up there.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.050
Go away now.

40:29.802 --> 40:30.970
Why don't I just sit here?

40:31.053 --> 40:32.138
I said go away!

40:37.059 --> 40:38.644
I'll wait for you out on the porch.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.369
Mr. Popovich,

40:56.579 --> 40:57.746
whichever way it goes,

40:59.915 --> 41:00.916
I enjoyed our talk.

41:21.103 --> 41:26.901
(chattering on radio)

41:31.906 --> 41:34.492
MAN ON RADIO:<i> I also have one female</i>
<i>in the R &amp; P tank.</i>

41:34.575 --> 41:35.868
<i>Can I have a time check?</i>

41:35.951 --> 41:36.994
Nothing.

41:56.931 --> 41:57.765
Let's go.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.113
Let's go, Mr. Popovich.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.289
I can't condone your actions, Henry.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.709
Nevertheless, it was a first-rate job.

42:28.671 --> 42:29.672
How'd you pull it off?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.591
I lied through my teeth to him, Howard.

43:01.328 --> 43:03.247
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.

43:04.039 --> 43:07.459
I told you we should have pulled him out
of there right after the warehouse bust.

43:07.543 --> 43:08.669
I begged you.

43:09.712 --> 43:13.757
And on the phone, when he didn't show up
for his wire, you kept telling me to wait.

43:15.009 --> 43:17.678
Mick, it wouldn't have changed anything.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.179
MICK: How do we know that?

43:19.471 --> 43:22.683
He had it all ahead of him,
and you threw his life away.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.937
His death is on your head.

43:30.065 --> 43:31.317
They all are, Mick.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.537
Ray, put out a warrant
for Jesse John Hudson's arrest.

43:44.496 --> 43:47.625
Get him for consorting.
Get him for anything, but get him.

43:48.584 --> 43:49.418
All right.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.507
-(grunts)
-Come here!

43:56.425 --> 43:58.427
Freeze! All right. Get him. Come on!

43:58.510 --> 43:59.678
What the hell's going on here?

43:59.762 --> 44:01.639
I got a warrant for your arrest.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.973
Hey, you must be joking!

44:03.057 --> 44:04.558
-WOMAN: Jesse.
-Check the bedroom.

44:05.059 --> 44:07.311
Jesse, what's going on out there?

44:07.394 --> 44:09.647
-WOMAN (yelping): Jesse!
-Don't move. Hold it.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.649
WASHINGTON: Just keep your hands in view,
baby, and everything'll be just cool.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.317
All right, baby.
Don't worry about a thing.

44:13.984 --> 44:15.694
Okay, let's see here.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.987
(humming)

44:17.071 --> 44:19.531
WOMAN: Hey, wait. That's my purse.
Get out of my purse.

44:19.615 --> 44:20.658
Oh, my.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.953
-JD: What are these, honey?
-Hey. Please.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.331
They're prescription for migraine.

44:27.414 --> 44:28.832
Then you have a pharmacy label?

44:29.875 --> 44:33.504
Neal, looks like we have
illegal narcotic substances here.

44:33.879 --> 44:37.591
I told you never to bring anything
in here-- not even an aspirin.

44:38.467 --> 44:41.762
I know they're Mickey Mouse charges,
but what other choice do I have?

44:45.099 --> 44:45.933
Listen. Listen!

44:46.475 --> 44:49.978
I watched three years of hard-won treaties
go right down the toilet

44:50.062 --> 44:53.649
because your office felt it was
politically inadvisable-- and I quote--

44:53.816 --> 44:55.150
"to lean on Jesse John Hudson."

44:55.693 --> 44:56.902
So while you play patty-cake
with the mayor--

44:56.985 --> 44:58.028
You bet I'm hot!

44:58.612 --> 45:00.239
I've got a dead cop on my hands,

45:00.322 --> 45:04.326
and I had to break the news to his mother
that her son was executed

45:04.410 --> 45:08.914
by a man who is putting down
a $200 bond on charges

45:09.415 --> 45:11.875
about as serious
as spitting on the sidewalk.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.131
I pushed violation of parole
because I had no other choice.

45:19.758 --> 45:22.553
You know, I don't give a damn about heat
from the mayor's office.

45:22.636 --> 45:24.096
You're the chief. You handle it.

45:35.774 --> 45:38.402
A perfectly understandable outburst,
Francis.

45:38.485 --> 45:40.487
Nevertheless, discretion-wise,

45:40.571 --> 45:44.199
why don't you let me draft a little note
of apology to the chief for you?

45:44.283 --> 45:46.744
We could send it down to Division
in the night pouch.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.832
Good idea, Phil. Thanks.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.167
You got it.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.177
Henry, what are you doing here?

46:06.138 --> 46:07.765
I could ask you the same thing.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.393
Well, I don't have a wife
and kid to go home to.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.189
Well, it seems that I don't, either.

46:17.399 --> 46:18.275
In my office.

46:40.172 --> 46:44.176
About three or four times over the years,

46:46.053 --> 46:46.929
whenever I've been

46:49.014 --> 46:51.642
particularly moody or uncommunicative,

46:53.393 --> 46:55.687
Rachel's asked me if I've
been seeing another woman.

46:57.356 --> 47:00.025
I always say no. She'd always believe me.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.820
She knows I'd never lie to her.

47:06.615 --> 47:07.449
But...

47:09.326 --> 47:10.953
tonight we were at dinner, and, uh--

47:15.374 --> 47:17.501
The fact is,
I have been spending time with

47:18.710 --> 47:19.545
this other woman.

47:21.421 --> 47:24.550
And Rachel suddenly looked me
right in the eye and asked me.

47:25.926 --> 47:27.094
I didn't have to say a word.

47:28.220 --> 47:30.806
She knew. It was written all over my face.

47:32.015 --> 47:32.933
Marone.

47:35.018 --> 47:37.187
Do you believe that?
1981, she gives me the boot.

47:39.398 --> 47:40.440
What are you gonna do?

47:40.524 --> 47:42.901
(sighs) I got a lot of paperwork
I thought I'd catch up on

47:42.985 --> 47:44.611
and then find a motel for the night.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.697
To hell with paperwork, Henry.

47:49.491 --> 47:50.784
Come on. I'll buy you a beer.

47:52.452 --> 47:55.497
You can come home and bunk
on my couch for the night.

47:59.293 --> 48:00.460
Sure it's not a bother?

48:02.880 --> 48:03.714
No bother.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.052
Slept on a few couches myself.

48:29.406 --> 48:31.408
(closing theme playing)
