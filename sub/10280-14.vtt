WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:07.641
Previously on ER:

00:07.675 --> 00:09.610
Hey! Where are you going?

00:09.643 --> 00:11.745
Want to see a picture
of my new girlfriend?

00:11.779 --> 00:12.613
Sure.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.248
What do you think?

00:14.282 --> 00:17.351
It's a plane.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.486
We were just allotted

00:18.519 --> 00:19.787
$2.4 million dollars
in new funding.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.622
I just hope that we
earned the allocation

00:21.655 --> 00:22.690
based on our merit.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.724
It's the least I could do.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.159
Helen is complaining

00:25.193 --> 00:27.428
of intermittent right side
abdominal pain.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.729
I think it's a tumor.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.198
I doubt it.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.632
I didn't realize
you were back

00:31.665 --> 00:32.833
on surgical rotation.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.468
ROMANO:
Nothing has changed.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.237
I'm losing
what little
strength I had,

00:36.270 --> 00:37.771
and sensory function
is non-existent.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.107
What do you want, Robert?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.608
I want my arm back.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.479
WOMAN:
Oh, my God...

00:45.513 --> 00:46.647
LOC on scene,
but awake

00:46.680 --> 00:48.149
when we got there
with GCS of 13.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.617
Calm down. We're going
to take care of you.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.684
Oh, God!

00:50.718 --> 00:52.253
What we got?
17-year-old.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.721
Auto versus multiple
peds at a high school.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.689
Open facial fracture,
abdominal pain.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.291
Sounds like she dumped a lung.

00:57.325 --> 00:58.692
BP's 110/70.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.361
Tachy after one liter.
Name's Gayla Ray.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.130
Break out the epistaxis tray,
page trauma.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.664
Gayla, do you have
any medical problems

01:03.697 --> 01:04.765
we need to know about?

01:04.798 --> 01:06.334
LOCKHART:
That's a "yes."

01:06.367 --> 01:07.635
Is this the full arrest
crush injury?

01:07.668 --> 01:09.170
Pinned between the car
and a wall.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.271
Bunch of kids got nailed

01:10.304 --> 01:11.372
on the front steps
of their school.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.673
Drunk driver?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.375
Worse, 16-year-old got
a driver's license.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.743
Still no pulse.
CHEN:
Resume CPR.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.445
You try and tube
her in the field?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.712
Twice, but she's way anterior.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.780
Had to scoop and run.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.149
ROMANO:
Car versus pedestrian--

01:21.182 --> 01:22.583
steel's going to win every time.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.418
Chest full of sub-cue air.
Thoracotomy?

01:24.452 --> 01:25.886
Tube in every hole
and pronounce.
What?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.521
And since Pratt went out
of his way

01:27.555 --> 01:28.756
to wear a tie
this morning,

01:28.789 --> 01:29.857
let's let him do
chest, airway,

01:29.890 --> 01:31.192
and needle the
pericardium.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.593
She's young, she might convert.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.395
Yeah, and there might
be a brand-new Hyundai

01:34.428 --> 01:36.164
behind door #1,
but more than likely

01:36.197 --> 01:37.665
it's a jackass and 50 cases
of elbow macaroni.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.467
Vaseline gauze.
I'll give you $200

01:39.500 --> 01:41.669
if you've got a surgical
candidate on that gurney.

01:41.702 --> 01:42.670
ENT, ortho and
general to start.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.571
Okay, let's turn her.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.772
I can't breathe...

01:44.805 --> 01:46.274
Don't try and
swallow, okay?

01:46.307 --> 01:48.209
We'll get that
blood out for you.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.310
I'm scared.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.179
ROMANO:
Don't be.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.247
Rocket Romano never lets
anything happen

01:53.281 --> 01:54.448
to pretty girls
like you.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.383
LOCKHART:
Tachy at 120.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.617
BP's 100, systolic.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.652
Frazier tip suction
for the nose.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.188
Zygoma is mobile.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.190
It looks like a LeFort three.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.691
Does it hurt when
I press here, Gayla?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.426
Okay, we need to operate
on your belly,

02:05.459 --> 02:06.927
but don't worry, you're
going to be fine.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.729
You have a minute
to speak privately?

02:08.762 --> 02:10.431
I've got a girl losing blood
by the pint,

02:10.464 --> 02:11.899
but sure, let's have
coffee and donuts.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.901
Call Maser in the OR,
tell her we got a hot e-lap.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.603
You think a posterior bleed?

02:15.636 --> 02:16.804
ROMANO:
Place to start.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.672
I left you a number
of messages.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.940
A gram of Cefotetan
and make sure

02:19.973 --> 02:21.675
the blood bank gets a clot
this time.

02:21.709 --> 02:22.610
Even sent a memo.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.611
She stable enough for CT?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.945
Tachycardic and hypotensive.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.447
Let's get this
little minx upstairs.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.715
That's all right,
I'll take her.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.383
What do you think
you're doing?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.252
Based on your fine assessment
and e-lap.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.654
Call and have one of
the surgical residents scrub in.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.289
I already did that
for Dr. Romano.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.924
Despite the fact
he has no OR privileges?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.526
I'm a supervising attending.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.427
Only on procedures
you're capable

02:39.460 --> 02:40.794
of performing yourself.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.596
What are you saying?
I can't scrub in?

02:42.630 --> 02:43.697
I'm saying, read my memo.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.665
Let's get this young lady

02:44.698 --> 02:45.733
to the OR.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.238
Oh, and
congratulations, Kerry.

02:50.238 --> 02:53.241
No one deserves it more.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:54.802 --> 03:57.671
If you can't vote,
you shouldn't be able to drive.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.308
I got my license the
minute I turned 16.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.843
Yeah, but you were never
a teenager-teenager.

04:02.876 --> 04:03.911
You're responsible.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.346
I was a total idiot.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.681
All I cared about
was finding a boyfriend.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.916
Hmm, nothing like now, right?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.318
Do you think
Carter can cover

04:10.351 --> 04:11.385
the last hour
of my shift?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.787
He's leaving for Belize.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.988
Ah, the scuba thing.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.325
Mm-hmm. A week of fun
in the sun.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.760
Yeah, while you get
stuck here in the rain.

04:19.793 --> 04:23.464
Well, all of his diving buddies
are nitrox-certified,

04:23.497 --> 04:26.400
whatever that means,
and I can barely snorkel, so...

04:26.434 --> 04:28.769
Still.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.438
What do you have,
a date or something?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.473
A friend of a friend set me up
with some guy.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.508
Blind date.

04:34.542 --> 04:38.446
Just proves that some
of us never really
leave high school.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.982
Sasha Melman,

04:42.015 --> 04:43.517
16, bilateral femur fracture.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.718
It's amazing she's not worse.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.354
Book, shoes, blood everywhere.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.356
It hurts
so much!

04:48.389 --> 04:49.590
Sasha, I'm Dr. Lewis.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.058
Can you wiggle your toes for me?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.493
I don't think I can.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.362
Good popliteal pulses.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.429
Okay, page ortho.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.097
A gram of ancef and 300 of gent.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.432
Are my friends okay?

04:58.466 --> 04:59.800
Yes, we're
helping them.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.835
Helen Broznich,
up and limping at the scene.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.505
Vitals stable, no LOC,
no chest or abdominal injuries.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.939
Any ETOH or
drugs on board?

05:05.973 --> 05:08.108
She denies both,
but she's agitated.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.377
He's choking me.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.778
This the driver?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.779
Helen, I'm Dr. Weaver.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.813
Where are you hurt?

05:12.846 --> 05:14.014
Everywhere, all the time.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.383
GALLANT:
What's open?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.385
Trauma two.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.052
( alarms beeping )

05:19.086 --> 05:20.087
Come on, damn it.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.054
Still agonal.

05:21.088 --> 05:21.889
Try isuprel, wide open.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.491
What's going on?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.393
You completed the PEA algorithms
ten minutes ago.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.461
She's young, we want
to give her a little longer.

05:27.495 --> 05:28.629
You gave her a lot longer.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.431
Call it or I will.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.065
Oh, sorry, I thought
the room was clear.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.501
Is she dead?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.403
Gallant, get Helen
to another room for now.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.604
That's Terri. Is she dead?

05:36.637 --> 05:37.738
Gallant?

05:37.771 --> 05:40.408
I thought I hit the brakes.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.645
11:29.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.419
Hmm.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.487
What do you figure
this cost the taxpayers?

05:53.521 --> 05:56.790
"Kerry, congrats to the
best doc in Chicago.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.492
Alderman Bright."

05:58.526 --> 06:00.428
Think he's trying to get her
to change teams or what?

06:00.428 --> 06:01.595
My guess?

06:01.629 --> 06:02.830
Or what.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.064
Hmm.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.599
You know, I could
pick up a bottle

06:05.633 --> 06:07.435
of this stuff for us
tonight if you want.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.902
That stuff is about
200 bucks a pop.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.170
Well, I guess
you're buying then.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.672
( laughs )

06:11.705 --> 06:13.474
Dispo'ed Mr. Pagini.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.443
Waiting on a bed
for Mrs. Golove.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.445
Mary Galloway
is up in CT.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.480
And I'm off to the second
largest barrier reef

06:19.513 --> 06:20.481
in the world.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.181
Bring Dramamine.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.716
And repellent.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.752
They got mosquitoes the size
of eagles in Belize.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.819
Not to mention pirates.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.820
So, Deb?

06:26.854 --> 06:27.955
Hmm?
You and Pratt, huh?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.723
Uh, yeah, I guess.
You guess?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.725
Well, we're not, you know,
exclusive or anything.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.093
ER? Oh, Hi, Maggie.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.562
We're just kind of
casually attached.

06:34.595 --> 06:35.696
Here, hold,
let me check.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.897
Frank, did we hear
anything from OB

06:36.930 --> 06:38.466
about a bed for Kim Cohen?

06:38.499 --> 06:41.168
No, but I've got your
mom on line one.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.471
Abby? Line one?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.204
Yeah, I'm on my way out.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.606
Could you take a message?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.774
You mean another one?

06:46.807 --> 06:47.875
Maggie called?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.142
Twice.
Why?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.478
I don't know.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.179
She wants
to talk to me.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.683
Make it up, be a
family, whatever.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.118
You're not interested
in doing that?

06:58.151 --> 06:59.753
No, not really.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.523
If you're mad at your mom,
you should tell her.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.491
Don't just ignore her.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.494
Okay, thanks.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.963
I took a split shift
so I could see you off.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.231
My flight's not for hours.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.033
I know.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.569
Did you see the car coming?

07:15.603 --> 07:18.238
Two-inch scalp lac,
GCS 15, no LOC.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.940
I was going to throw
in a few 5-0 nylon

07:19.973 --> 07:21.542
and send her home
with a head sheet.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.843
Did you hear
the squeal of brakes?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.244
Switch to prolene.
FRANK:
ER.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.246
Blue stitches are easier
to find for removal.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.516
Any other minor injuries
in the accident?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.883
Uh, just the driver
in curtain three.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.084
Bad ankle.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.786
Apparently, she lost control
of her car.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.788
Dr. Lewis, this one's
got a clotted PICC line.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.223
Can you take him?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.091
Oh, yeah, sure. Just give me
a couple of minutes. okay?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.561
16-years-old with
stable lateral
malleolus fracture

07:40.594 --> 07:41.562
and multiple abrasions.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.730
Blood alcohol and tox screen?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.031
First thing cops
had me check.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.198
Came back clean.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.534
Head CT's negative, but...

07:46.567 --> 07:47.568
She's concussed?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.702
Well, it's hard to tell.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.571
Hi. I'm Dr. Lewis.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.805
I remember you.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.173
Said she was here last week.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.708
Got diagnosed with hepatitis.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.744
Oh, yeah, right.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.246
So, um, uh, Helen,
what happened today?

07:59.279 --> 08:01.248
Uh, there are these squirrels
at my school.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.650
I saw one in the road.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.552
And you swerved?

08:04.585 --> 08:06.687
Squirrels are
rabies carriers.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.855
So are raccoons.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.289
Is my dad here yet?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.291
Uh, we'll go check, okay?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.160
Well, she's not
jaundiced enough

08:13.193 --> 08:14.695
for hepatic
encephalopathy.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.130
Yeah, she'd be altered,
not just weird.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.232
Dr. Lewis,
your blind date called.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.602
The restaurant you picked
doesn't work for him.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.870
Oh, for God's sake.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.105
He wants you to call
him and regroup.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.807
Hey, you choose
someplace exotic?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.108
Yeah, a steak house.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.309
( laughs )

08:29.342 --> 08:30.778
So, Keener's
thyroidectomy

08:30.811 --> 08:32.011
will now be supervised
by Dr. Corday.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.614
Correct.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.982
What about Jocelyn
Gaine's Billroth Two?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.216
Uh, push it if possible.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.018
I'm buried
in administrative backwash.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.019
If not?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.220
Anspaugh will take it.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.020
Robert.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.756
Kerry.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.958
There's going to be a press
conference in a few minutes.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.293
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.128
Look, I know
you wanted the position,

08:48.161 --> 08:50.030
and I just wanted to check in
and make sure

08:50.063 --> 08:51.599
that you are feeling okay
about this.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.300
Well, how
am I feeling?

08:53.333 --> 08:56.036
Um... pretty damned
grateful, actually.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.738
I've got a good
heart, a good soul,

08:57.771 --> 08:59.607
and unlike our newly
appointed liaison,

08:59.640 --> 09:00.708
two good legs.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.142
Dr. Weaver, we're ready for you.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.612
Ask yourself what you did
to deserve this, Kerry.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.013
A lot of hard work, actually.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.115
Yeah, and what your
Alderman wants in return.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.783
He doesn't want anything.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.352
Not everyone's an opportunistic
asshole like you.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.721
Yeah.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.789
So I'm told.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.257
You still okay
with me going?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.627
Yeah, I said I was.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.096
And you meant it?

09:23.130 --> 09:25.899
What are you thinking?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.267
Nothing.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.869
Work?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.037
Nope.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.204
Your mom.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.373
God, no.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.175
Come on, tell me.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.644
A song.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.811
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

09:37.845 --> 09:38.979
Which one?

09:39.012 --> 09:41.649
From the '70s.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.883
It's goofy...

09:42.916 --> 09:44.384
"Blinded by the Light?"
No.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.219
"Love Will Keep Us Together?"
No.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.989
What?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.991
* Rubbing sticks
and stones together *

09:51.024 --> 09:52.125
* Makes the sparks ignite...

09:52.159 --> 09:53.794
No.

09:53.827 --> 09:58.065
* And the thought
of something, something *

09:58.098 --> 10:01.735
* It's getting so exciting

10:01.769 --> 10:03.203
Are you done?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.272
* Skyrockets in flight

10:05.305 --> 10:08.275
* Afternoon delight

10:08.308 --> 10:10.077
( laughter )

10:10.110 --> 10:12.045
* Aaa....
No, no, please don't.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.714
Please don't.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.182
( laughs )

10:15.215 --> 10:17.050
( phone rings )

10:17.084 --> 10:18.285
You going to get that?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.020
No.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.199
ALDERMAN BRIGHT:
It's an utterly
thankless position.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.968
No money, endless paperwork,
countless meetings.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.070
But it still remains
a great honor.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.973
Therefore, on behalf
of the Board of Commissioners,

10:40.007 --> 10:43.844
I am proud and privileged
to name Dr. Kerry Weaver

10:43.877 --> 10:46.313
as Medical Liaison
to Cook County's

10:46.346 --> 10:49.082
Public Health Care
Administration.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.052
( applause )

10:52.085 --> 10:53.453
Thank you, Alderman.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.056
I, uh, couldn't have accepted
this position

10:56.089 --> 10:59.359
without the continued support
of my colleagues here at County.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.428
FEMALE REPORTER:
Dr. Weaver,

11:01.461 --> 11:03.797
how are you qualified
for this office?

11:03.831 --> 11:07.901
You mean can
a non-policy wonk
do the job?

11:07.935 --> 11:10.370
Uh, well, running a
trauma center is perhaps

11:10.403 --> 11:12.339
the ultimate
training ground

11:12.372 --> 11:13.473
for public
health care,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.909
and we are in a
health care crisis.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.245
This position allows
me the opportunity

11:18.278 --> 11:20.748
to apply practical
solutions to problems

11:20.781 --> 11:22.315
that have been
dealt with

11:22.349 --> 11:24.484
all too
bureaucratically
in the past.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.055
Are there any
other questions?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.457
How will balancing two demanding
jobs affect your home life?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.927
It won't.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.763
She's single.
So am I.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.298
And we make a
handsome couple,
don't you think?

11:38.331 --> 11:43.837
( laughter )

11:45.773 --> 11:48.375
Thank you.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.114
Hey, I reached
Helen Broznich's father.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.849
No chicken either, huh?

11:55.883 --> 11:56.984
I'll come back.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.286
Really?
They actually fry tofu.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.523
Okay, well, I'll see you
tonight at 7:00. Bye.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.225
Your, uh, your date's
a vegetarian?

12:05.258 --> 12:07.861
No, a vegan, whatever
the hell that means.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.096
Nothing
with a face.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.499
No meat, no eggs, no dairy.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.934
Oh.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.302
Oh, you're the guy
with the PICC line.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.469
Sean.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.005
MAN:
Need a doc
over here!

12:18.038 --> 12:18.906
Oh, got to go.
You want these?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.073
Oh, I...

12:20.107 --> 12:21.441
Wilma Rasmussen,
94 years old,

12:21.474 --> 12:23.811
with fever and altered
mental status, BP 85/60.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.078
That's pretty low.
Pneumonia?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.947
WOMAN:
No, she's had
pneumonia before.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.081
This is different.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.983
Her daughter.
She live you?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.118
No, I live with her.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.256
Hey, save some
donnatol for me.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.157
Cut it out.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.158
What?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.893
I just
need two tabs.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.360
Oh.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.162
Sorry.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.132
No, actually, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.200
I was out of line
earlier.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.003
This is work,
and the last thing

12:50.037 --> 12:51.839
you need to deal
with is gossip.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.174
I get that,
and I respect it.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.976
You do?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.245
Yes, I'm the same way.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.579
CHUNY:
Hey, Pratt.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.882
I have a patient waiting
for you in curtain one.

13:01.915 --> 13:05.218
I'll be right there.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.321
So you two
going to get engaged?

13:08.355 --> 13:11.158
No, not even close.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.893
I don't know
about that.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.028
Pratt's been acting
all in love.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.530
MAN:
Dizzy, weak,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.199
light-headed...

13:19.232 --> 13:21.001
PRATT:
Classic symptoms of
a low blood count.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.070
Tinnitus, palpitations...

13:24.437 --> 13:26.139
Drove my wife nuts
over it.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.108
She divorced me
because of it.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.576
Trouble is, you don't
look anemic.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.611
Yeah, but in
pernicious anemia,

13:31.644 --> 13:33.013
symptoms may occur

13:33.046 --> 13:35.448
even in the absence
of a low hemoglobin.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.917
Trust me on this, Doc.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.018
If I don't
get a shot soon,

13:38.051 --> 13:39.052
it's going to get
a lot worse.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.220
You been taking B-12?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.955
Up until two months ago.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.556
I went to see my doc
in '86

13:43.590 --> 13:46.159
'cause I was feeling
really run down.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.128
My doc made
the diagnosis.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.097
Since then, I've been
feeling real fit,

13:50.130 --> 13:52.032
as long as I stay
regular on it.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.102
Bastard died on me
a month ago.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.104
My doctor.
That's why I'm here.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.371
For your B-12 fix?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.974
Yeah, I take up to 100
micrograms IM a month,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.310
but, you know, I think
since it's been so long,

14:03.343 --> 14:04.611
I should take half
a milligram.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.279
I'm way overdue.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.514
I think I'll need
to check out a few things

14:07.547 --> 14:09.049
before we go
prescribing anything.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.450
Save yourself the trouble.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.990
"Victims of
pernicious anemia"?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.092
You're looking at the president.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.329
So what do you think
it is this time?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.563
Your mom has
a kidney infection.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.298
Does that explain
why she's so groggy?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.533
Possibly,
but she also has

14:26.566 --> 14:28.135
a number of other
health problems.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.469
Haleh, can you
send this up for culture?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.104
Hang 500 of Levaquin

14:31.138 --> 14:33.306
and start her on dopamine
at five mikes per kilo.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.541
Well, that
sounds serious.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.509
At 94,
everything's serious.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.245
GIRL:
Excuse me, our friends
were brought here.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.479
There was an accident
at our school.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.680
What are their names?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.049
Terri, Sasha,
and I think Janey,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.216
and Lisa also
got hurt too.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.684
Can we see them?
Are they okay?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.119
Excuse me,
we can only give

14:46.153 --> 14:47.955
that sort of information
out to relatives.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.056
But they're
like our best friends.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.623
Have your parents
call the school,

14:50.657 --> 14:53.126
and they'll update you on
everything that's happening.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.027
Was it that bad?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.162
Did they die?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.064
Oh, God, we totally
cut class today.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.132
I can only give that information
out to relatives.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.133
Was she there?

15:00.167 --> 15:01.668
Did she see
this happen?

15:01.701 --> 15:03.570
Hey, wait, wait,
you can't go in there.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.039
Helen, you have
to tell us what happened.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.607
Why are you
asking me?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.142
Who all got hurt?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.410
You don't even know me.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.711
Forget her.
She's a freak.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.980
Let's call my mom.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.547
She friends
with the principle.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.452
They're popular.

15:22.255 --> 15:22.689
You did good, kid.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.424
Thank you.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.127
I only wish I'd fallen off
a stage two years ago.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.229
Would have kept us
from appointing

15:29.262 --> 15:30.597
your god-awful
predecessor.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.099
Still having
trouble with that?

15:32.132 --> 15:33.666
Ah, Kennedy had
chronic back pain

15:33.700 --> 15:35.168
and ran the country.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.337
The least I can do
is tolerate a bum knee.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.173
You know what,
let me write you a prescription

15:40.207 --> 15:41.574
for some more Vicodin.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.709
That's all right.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.111
Don't be ridiculous.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.612
Why suffer if you
don't have to.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.280
Touch base later
this week?

15:47.314 --> 15:48.415
Look forward to it.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.017
Uh, don't put
your pen away.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.119
I need another signature
for a subdural.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.721
So, uh, congratulations
on your appointment, by the way.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.223
Thank you.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.558
So what is it, a county
committee type thing?

15:58.591 --> 16:00.093
Something like that.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.095
Well, if you can get us
two more nurses a shift,

16:02.129 --> 16:03.130
I'm all for it.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.032
Still no word from Dr. Kovac?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.199
Nope.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.667
And you tried
calling him again?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.102
Yes, ma'am.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.109
Yeah, Luka,
this is Kerry Weaver.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.278
I'm down two attendings
and up 40 patients.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.546
If you don't get in here

16:19.579 --> 16:20.747
and start working
your scheduled shifts,

16:20.780 --> 16:22.182
I'm going
to call the INS,

16:22.215 --> 16:23.750
tell them your
green card's a fake

16:23.783 --> 16:25.152
and have your ass
deported.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.257
You'll need longer arms

16:30.290 --> 16:32.059
if you're planning on
treating her from here.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.293
Why haven't you
cleared her yet?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.394
She still needs
a posterior splint.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.728
Dr. Weaver?
Hold on.

16:35.762 --> 16:36.596
Look, we're buried
here, Gallant...

16:36.629 --> 16:38.231
Look, I realize that...

16:38.265 --> 16:39.299
It's the Emergency
Services Committee....

16:39.332 --> 16:41.068
If you and your
attending

16:41.101 --> 16:42.302
can't handle a simple
ankle fracture, I'll do it.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.203
Now clear the bed.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.671
Where do you want it?

16:44.704 --> 16:46.773
In the lounge and I don't
want to be disturbed.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.477
What'd I miss?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.245
Two more messages
from your mother.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.281
She says it's very
important that you call.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.282
Right.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.083
Carter get off okay?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.450
Yes, he did.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.353
Mm, five Sigma Nu's
loose in Belize...

17:00.387 --> 17:02.089
Hope they brought
a lot of bail money.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.556
You know, I still have
friends on the PD

17:03.590 --> 17:05.492
who could run a background
check on your date.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.792
Already checked,
no arrests.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.228
Or he hasn't
been caught yet.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.729
Aren't you the optimistic one.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.665
Hey, you don't have
any plans tonight, do you?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.233
Excuse me?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.402
Carter's off with
the boys, it'd be fun.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.569
Dinner and drinks?

17:16.603 --> 17:17.637
Oh, don't let her
talk you

17:17.670 --> 17:19.106
into being
her chaperone.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.107
How is it everyone knows
I have a blind date?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.674
You told them.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.809
MAN:
Got a lady outside,
won't get out of my cab.

17:22.842 --> 17:23.710
I need a doctor.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.244
Where's she hurt?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.413
I don't know.
She ain't moving.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.452
CHEN:
You know her name?

17:32.485 --> 17:33.653
DRIVER:
Yeah, right.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.687
Showed me her
birth certificate

17:34.721 --> 17:36.123
before I gave
her a lift.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.624
CHEN:
Ma'am, ma'am, wake up.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.625
She's been beaten up.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.327
Come on, open your eyes for us.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.761
LOCKHART:
She's got a weak
radial pulse

17:41.794 --> 17:43.396
and there's blood
on her hands.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.298
Ma'am, ma'am, can you
tell us what happened?

17:45.332 --> 17:46.533
Oh, wow.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.568
Oh... come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

17:48.601 --> 17:50.537
I'm not going to get paid, am I?

17:50.570 --> 17:51.771
No hemotympanum.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.540
Systolic's 120
after the first liter.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.541
This may burn
a little.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.176
( groaning )

17:56.209 --> 17:58.211
It's okay, I'm just
numbing up your belly.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.212
Do you know
who did this to you?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
Kids.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.881
Kids?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.317
Need to pick my kids
up from school.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.685
Can arrange to have
them brought here,

18:05.718 --> 18:07.154
but we need
to know your name first.

18:07.187 --> 18:08.888
Monica... Walker.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.423
Monica, we have
to figure out

18:10.457 --> 18:12.359
if your going
to need surgery.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.493
Got to go...

18:13.526 --> 18:14.761
No, no.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.229
You have to talk
to the police later.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.898
No... can't do that.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.334
Please...

18:21.368 --> 18:22.802
LOCKHART:
Somebody beat you
pretty badly.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.472
She owes me 11 bucks and change.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.639
Check the bra for cash.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.241
What?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.442
She's a hooker, that's
where they keep it.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.410
Hey, get the hell
out of here, now.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.544
Out, out!

18:31.578 --> 18:33.213
What have we got?
What have we got?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.215
Penetrating abdominal
injury of uncertain depth.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.516
And these are?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.518
Three lab-coated tumors.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.886
You're teaching?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.454
This is a teaching hospital.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.822
Good bowel sounds,
normotensive.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.593
Can you tell how long
the knife was?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.296
'Cause you sure as hell
didn't get in on your IQ.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.330
Help me retract here.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.266
Only into the sub-Q,

18:53.300 --> 18:54.934
but there could be an
intraperitoneal component.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.369
Deep fascia's intact.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.271
Gram of ancef
and update her tetanus.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.206
So no surgery.
That' right.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.540
You boneheads in the ER

19:00.573 --> 19:01.874
are going to have to work
for a change.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.743
Irrigate the wound,
loose approximation,

19:03.776 --> 19:04.844
and follow serial exams.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.246
Let's go.
That way, what way.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.914
Whose signature
do I get for the chart?

19:07.947 --> 19:09.349
Excuse me?

19:09.382 --> 19:12.252
For the official
surgical consult?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.690
I'm head of surgery
and chief of staff.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.360
That should do it.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.229
That way.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.265
Turn left.

19:27.567 --> 19:28.768
I don't like
to be touched.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.237
Dr. Weaver's
almost finished.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.305
They'll hate me
even more now.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.273
Who will?

19:33.306 --> 19:34.574
Everyone
at my school.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.243
Why, because
of what happened?

19:36.276 --> 19:39.579
Helen, what happened was tragic,
but it was an accident.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.350
It was rainy, and you
lost control of your car.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.986
Who was your
attending on this?

19:47.019 --> 19:47.820
Dr. Lewis.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.289
Get her.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.258
Helen, do you ever
have any problems

19:51.291 --> 19:53.260
with rigid muscles
or jerkiness?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.894
I can be a real spaz sometimes.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.763
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.731
LEWIS:
What is it, Kerry?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.000
She has gold-colored
deposits in the cornea.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.236
I don't like
to be touched.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.904
Kayser-Fleischer rings.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.773
They're pathognomonic
for Wilson's disease, right?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.341
What's that?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.377
Your body may have an
inability to excrete copper,

20:10.410 --> 20:12.312
causing it to build up
in the liver and the brain.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.713
Really?

20:13.746 --> 20:15.014
We'll need to run
some tests to be sure,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.416
but I'll be
right back, okay?

20:16.449 --> 20:19.819
WEAVER:
She was here a week ago?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.254
I treated her
and released her.

20:21.288 --> 20:21.821
Did Gallant
do an eye exam?

20:21.854 --> 20:23.623
Of course he did,

20:23.656 --> 20:25.525
but Wilson's is a total zebra,
especially to a med student.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.294
Yeah, what's
your excuse?

20:27.327 --> 20:29.362
Well, the rings may not have
been this prominent last week.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.498
Okay, send off
a serum ceruloplasmin

20:31.531 --> 20:33.566
and find me when
you get the results.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.934
She's having
trouble breathing.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.303
Who?
Your old lady.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.705
Pulse ox down to 82
on five liters.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.739
What's happening?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.374
Respiratory rate's up to 30.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.910
The fluid we gave your mom
to raise her blood pressure

20:43.943 --> 20:46.279
is going to her lungs.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.348
Normally, we treat with
lasix and nitroglycerin,

20:48.381 --> 20:49.982
but those would lower her
blood pressure even further.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.718
Oh, God.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.386
Sharon, I know you love
your mother very much,

20:53.420 --> 20:54.987
but you need to think
about how aggressively

20:55.021 --> 20:56.323
you want to handle this.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.023
You don't
understand.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.358
I need her.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.327
Of course you need her.
No.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.563
I need her
Social Security checks.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.565
CHEN:
Another 4-0 nylon.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.067
He was a regular.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.337
Just went nuts on me.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.405
May be time for
a new profession.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.007
Got to feed my kids.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.478
How old are they?

21:18.511 --> 21:21.814
Luke's seven,
Christy's 12.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.050
They know what you do?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.017
No.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.354
Don't need to.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.522
I'm there when
the leave for school,

21:29.556 --> 21:31.958
there when they get back
and I'm there

21:31.991 --> 21:33.760
till they go
to sleep at night.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.730
Wait, you go out
after they're in bed?

21:37.764 --> 21:41.568
Look, I'm not a junkie,

21:41.601 --> 21:43.970
and I don't have a pimp.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.775
I just work enough
to support my kids.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.378
But they're home by themselves.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.581
LOCKHART:
That was fast.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.948
MONICA:
I don't want
to talk to him.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.850
Well, they have
to document the assault.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.420
I don't want
to talk to the police.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.622
She doesn't want
to file a report.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.457
You Abby Lockhart?

22:04.491 --> 22:05.858
Yeah.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.127
Officer Beechum, Chicago PD.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.029
We were asked
to come find you.
Me?

22:10.062 --> 22:12.965
Minneapolis PD has reported
that a small aircraft

22:12.999 --> 22:16.002
your brother Eric Wyzcenski
was flying has disappeared.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.905
Your mother asked us
to notify you.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.508
Apparently, she was unable
to reach you by phone.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.975
Okay.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.611
Okay, what, what does
that mean, "disappeared"?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.413
Where was he?

22:26.413 --> 22:30.082
Well, radar last picked him up
over Lake Superior 11 hours ago.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.818
You can call
the FAA up there

22:31.851 --> 22:33.085
for more information.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.555
I'm sorry.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.697
Okay, explain to me

22:44.731 --> 22:46.866
how somebody
just goes off radar.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.473
What you are saying is
you think he went down.

22:53.506 --> 22:56.509
Right. What-what are
the other possibilities?

22:57.109 --> 22:58.611
Okay, did...

22:58.645 --> 23:01.013
did you have
any communications from him,

23:01.047 --> 23:03.082
like a Mayday or whatever...

23:04.116 --> 23:05.585
No.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.689
Yes, I'm reachable here.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.994
I thought he was
an air traffic controller.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.729
He always wanted to fly.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.665
He just got his license.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.766
Did you reach Carter?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.468
I had him paged in Miami,

23:21.468 --> 23:23.736
but I guess the flight
already took off.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.472
Does your mom know anything?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.006
I haven't called her.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.541
Do you think you should?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.710
I think I'm stressed
out enough as it is

23:30.743 --> 23:32.745
without having to deal
with her, too.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.080
Yeah, you should go home.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.485
Do people know?

23:38.518 --> 23:41.921
About Eric? Some.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.490
I'd rather they didn't.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.557
You should still go home.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.892
I'm going to stay.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.059
Thanks.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.828
Hold, please.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.130
Radiology needs you to send
Stewart back up-- film's bad.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.900
Abby, guy from the school
district dropped off

23:53.933 --> 23:56.202
Monica Walker's kids.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.537
Who?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.539
The hooker
with the slashed belly?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.007
All right, okay.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.642
Hi.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.044
Okay, I'll take you
to see your mom now.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.646
Is my mom
going to be okay?

24:06.679 --> 24:07.747
Yeah, she is.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.948
Did she get mugged again?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.150
Thanks anyway.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.522
Kids are here.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.557
Go ahead, go right in.

24:17.590 --> 24:21.528
Hey, guys!
Oh, it's good to see you.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.829
She denied everything.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.197
Told the cops she fell
through a window.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.566
Probably tell her kids

24:26.599 --> 24:27.700
the same thing.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.969
You think it would
be better

24:30.002 --> 24:32.972
if she told them
a john slashed her?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.240
Are you all right?

24:34.273 --> 24:36.943
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.647
Mr. Marshman?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.616
Could you turn your
hearing aid down, please?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.551
Thank you.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.818
What?

24:45.852 --> 24:48.555
Labs back
on your B-12 guy, Vitelli.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.957
Hemoglobin's 14,
hematocrit's 42.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.559
Anything wrong?

24:56.262 --> 24:58.665
Stan, my man,
it's your lucky day.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.667
You giving me my shot?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.603
No. Your doctor never did
a Schilling test on you, did he?

25:03.636 --> 25:04.737
I knew it was unlikely,

25:04.771 --> 25:06.072
given your age,
your ethnicity.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.807
My grandmother is
from northern Europe.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.610
Ninety percent of pernicious
anemia patients have

25:10.643 --> 25:12.579
the anti-parietal cell antibody.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.582
And your blood test
was negative for it.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.217
So I'm in the ten percent
without the antibody.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.252
You have
a normal cobalamin level.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.921
Do you know what that is,
Stanley?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.723
Vitamin B-12.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.626
And what causes
pernicious anemia?

25:26.659 --> 25:31.063
B-12 deficiency from
lack of intrinsic factor.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.733
You don't have the disease.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.602
You never did.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.706
I can stay home
and take care of you.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.609
Don't even think about missing
school on my account.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.011
He's only trying
to get out of a
math test anyway.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.345
Am not, butthead.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.615
My little
brother's goofy.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.850
Ignore him,
that's what I do.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.186
Were you talking to me?

25:54.220 --> 25:57.056
They're good kids.

25:57.089 --> 26:00.126
I do the best
I can, you know.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.161
I really do.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.666
I-I-I don't think
I'm going to be able to get home

26:06.699 --> 26:07.934
as early as I thought.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.636
How... well,
how about a late supper?

26:09.669 --> 26:13.339
Kerry? Labs are back
on Helen Broznich.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.042
Sandy, I'm going
to have to call you back.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.209
Is the father here?

26:17.243 --> 26:19.178
Yeah, you want me
to tell him?

26:19.211 --> 26:20.680
Absolutely not.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.915
Hello.
I'm Dr. Weaver.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.083
Walter Broznich.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.953
This is all so terrible.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.655
How, how are
the other girls?

26:28.655 --> 26:30.189
Uh, I'm not sure.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.726
I shouldn't have let Helen drive
in that damn rain.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.994
She going to be okay?

26:35.027 --> 26:36.929
Mr. Broznich,
in addition to the injuries

26:36.963 --> 26:39.231
that your daughter sustained
in the accident,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.067
we found that she has
a rare disorder

26:41.100 --> 26:42.134
called Wilson's disease.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.736
I'm confused.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.405
Last week you people said
she had hepatitis.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.875
She does, in the
sense that her liver

26:48.908 --> 26:51.243
is inflamed as a result
of copper accumulation.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.245
I have some
in my brain, too.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.414
Wilson's is
a genetic condition

26:55.447 --> 26:58.951
that can cause both psychiatric
and motor disorders,

26:58.985 --> 27:01.020
in particular,
jerky movements.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.256
It's usually not symptomatic
until adolescence.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.792
Is that why I hit the gas

27:05.825 --> 27:07.026
and not the brakes?

27:07.059 --> 27:09.361
That would be
my suspicion, yeah.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.897
It's curable?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.699
It's manageable.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.434
There's a Rick Kelly
who's a wildlife artist.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.036
Click on that
other Web site.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.404
You think it's
the rock climber?

27:18.437 --> 27:20.773
Oh, cute!

27:20.807 --> 27:23.710
Especially with those
tight shorts.

27:23.743 --> 27:24.443
( laughs )

27:24.476 --> 27:25.978
What are you doing?

27:26.012 --> 27:27.847
Ah, Google-ing your blind date.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.315
What?
That's so rude.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.718
If you want to know anything
about him, just ask me.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.419
Why? You've never
even met him.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.721
( gasps ):
Wow.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.454
( laughs )

27:35.487 --> 27:40.727
Buns of steel, huh?

27:40.727 --> 27:42.394
Are you sure this is him?

27:42.428 --> 27:43.730
( chuckling )

27:43.763 --> 27:47.199
What's so funny?

27:47.233 --> 27:48.901
What?

27:48.935 --> 27:51.771
Sorry about what's happening
with your brother, Abby.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.040
Hopefully, they'll find
him safe and sound.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.444
Well, I'd better get
back to the phones.

27:58.477 --> 28:01.113
Where'd you say
that Bell's Palsy
patient was?

28:01.147 --> 28:02.614
Exam One.
Here, I'll show you.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.887
I wish you'd just go home.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.889
Why? So people can
talk more freely

28:09.922 --> 28:11.223
about my tragic family?

28:11.257 --> 28:13.325
That's not where
it's coming from.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.427
You know that.
They're concerned.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.196
Yeah, I know.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.269
MAN:
Oh, what we can do is
interview the children,

28:23.302 --> 28:25.037
get a better sense
of their home life.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.439
Yeah, and if she's got customers
going home with her,

28:27.473 --> 28:28.941
there could be endangerment
as well.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.242
Who, who's this?

28:30.276 --> 28:32.211
Uh, Bruce Dorchester,
social services.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.880
I'm new.
I don't think we've met.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.782
So if your findings
support removal,

28:35.815 --> 28:37.784
will the children be
kept together?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.451
Uh, we'll make
every effort, yeah.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.120
Um, why, why are
you doing this?

28:41.153 --> 28:43.189
Abby, I know you
mean well, but we're...

28:43.222 --> 28:45.291
But what?
They're good kids.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.093
Their mother provides for them.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.361
Yes, by actively
prostituting herself.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.930
She has been arrested twice.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.464
Is she under arrest now?

28:52.498 --> 28:54.466
She admits to leaving
her minor children

28:54.500 --> 28:56.368
home alone at night.
Oh, come on!

28:56.402 --> 28:59.005
That's neglect.
Come on, we've seen
much worse.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.807
By law we have
to report this.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.075
Look, I shouldn't have
to explain this to you.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.444
You have to explain it
to somebody. It's wrong.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.814
This isn't your call.
Is it yours?

29:07.814 --> 29:09.048
You're a nurse, Abby.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.549
You don't have
the power to make

29:10.582 --> 29:12.284
this kind of decision.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.558
I think this sucks.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.327
DORCHESTER:
What is her problem?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.462
LEWIS:
She's using accessory muscles

29:23.495 --> 29:24.563
to breathe now.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.998
She talking at all?

29:26.032 --> 29:27.333
Asked where
her daughter was.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.400
Where is she?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.936
Bathroom, I think.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.839
Go to 20 mikes of dopamine.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.574
Mrs. Rasmussen?

29:35.607 --> 29:40.112
I need to talk to you
about your condition.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.447
Yes.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.016
Your lungs aren't working
too well anymore.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.852
Neither is your heart.

29:45.852 --> 29:47.019
If it gets much worse,

29:47.053 --> 29:48.855
we're going to have
to intubate you.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.490
No.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.559
Your daughter has asked us

29:53.592 --> 29:56.095
to do everything we can
to save you.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.297
But in situations like this,

29:58.330 --> 30:02.134
often, the treatment is worse
than the condition.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.236
There's something you can sign

30:04.270 --> 30:06.839
called a "do not resuscitate"
order.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.308
Plums.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.443
What?

30:11.477 --> 30:16.182
There are plums
in the backyard.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.617
They're so lovely.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.287
Sweet.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.556
Do you like plums?

30:34.600 --> 30:38.304
( sighs )

30:38.337 --> 30:41.874
I brought an umbrella
just in case.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.949
It is beautiful from up here,
isn't it?

30:49.982 --> 30:52.018
Yeah.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.954
Listen, if, uh,
if you need any help,

30:54.987 --> 30:59.391
need me to make some calls,
answer some questions, I...

30:59.425 --> 31:00.592
Do you believe...

31:00.626 --> 31:02.661
people can die instantly?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.196
Sorry?

31:04.230 --> 31:07.233
I don't know. I'm a nurse.

31:07.266 --> 31:12.638
I don't know if I believe it
happens instantly.

31:12.671 --> 31:17.643
A second can seem
like a lifetime.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.546
Like when you hit the brakes
to avoid hitting another car

31:20.579 --> 31:22.949
it seems like it takes forever
to stop.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.358
But maybe, if you go nose-first
into the water

31:32.391 --> 31:35.527
at 200 miles an hour,
it is instantaneous.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.701
At least, I hope it is.

31:42.734 --> 31:47.306
Why do you think he went
nose-first?

31:57.683 --> 32:00.052
I don't know.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.624
I better get back to work.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.233
So you say you're sick,

32:14.266 --> 32:16.002
you're broke,
you're unemployed and uninsured.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.536
Yeah, sure,
come on over.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.139
Mr. Wilner is regular again,
and I'm out of here.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.540
What you getting into?

32:21.573 --> 32:24.243
Uh, I think I'm going to stay,
do some studying.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.577
Missed a diagnosis today.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.712
Happens to the
best of us.

32:26.745 --> 32:29.148
Hey, you get one of these?

32:29.181 --> 32:30.316
Greetings
from Baltimore?

32:30.349 --> 32:31.550
Frank, Exam
One's cleared.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.152
Tell it to the next clerk.
I'm history.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.620
( phone rings )
Damn it.
County.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.555
Sounds like Leon's having
a nice time, huh?

32:36.588 --> 32:37.623
Oh, hi, Dr. Carter.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.058
Guess he's adjusting okay.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.492
Yeah, she's right here.
Just a minute.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.494
Yeah.
Abby, Carter's
on the line for you.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.430
Uh, I'll take
it in there.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.564
Well, have a good night.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.598
Yup, you, too.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.234
Plan on it.

32:48.267 --> 32:51.337
Hey, how you doing?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.573
Stanley.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.043
Thought you'd be out
painting the town by now.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.378
Huh, all my friends
are too tired to go out.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.646
You're kidding me, right?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.348
They all have
pernicious anemia.

33:02.381 --> 33:05.451
Everything in my life
was built around it.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.319
Support groups, therapy,

33:07.353 --> 33:09.088
committees...

33:09.121 --> 33:11.457
So, what do I do now?

33:11.490 --> 33:13.459
Well, you could try
enjoying yourself.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.594
How?

33:15.627 --> 33:18.430
So your flight
was all right, then?

33:18.464 --> 33:24.570
Um... Eric's plane disappeared.

33:24.603 --> 33:28.274
Went off radar or something.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.641
They don't know.

33:29.675 --> 33:34.480
Um, have you been
in the water yet?

33:34.513 --> 33:38.384
No, Carter, you don't have
to do that. You...

33:38.417 --> 33:42.821
Carter, he could show up
in an hour.

33:42.854 --> 33:47.559
I just want to wait and see
what happens, okay?

33:47.593 --> 33:51.297
Okay?

33:51.330 --> 33:53.265
All right, I have to go.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.234
I'll call you later.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.335
( bangs phone )

33:56.368 --> 33:57.336
( sniffles )

33:57.369 --> 33:59.538
( sighs )

34:02.274 --> 34:03.442
MARQUEZ:
Night, Abby.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.610
Good night.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.112
Hope everything's okay.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.413
Thanks.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.547
Okay, I'm taking six more.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.250
You might want to cut down
on the caffeine.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.484
Or give some to Connie.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.286
Her shift started
ten minutes ago.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.286
You need something done?

34:15.321 --> 34:16.422
A nipride drip in One.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.356
I'll do it.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.724
You rock.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.327
Am I crazy, or have you
been here since yesterday?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.728
Well, there's no
place like home.

34:22.761 --> 34:26.132
Help! I think my mother's having
a heart attack.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.467
How's this?

34:28.500 --> 34:31.437
It smells better anyway.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.273
I don't know how you people
stand all this crap!

34:34.306 --> 34:35.274
Me, either.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.542
You want some privacy?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.310
I want to get the
hell out of here.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.545
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.283
They still haven't found you
a bed upstairs?

34:44.315 --> 34:45.817
My dad went
to find out about it.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.188
Did anybody else die?

34:49.221 --> 34:51.357
In the accident?

34:51.389 --> 34:53.159
A couple of girls
were seriously injured,

34:53.159 --> 34:55.627
but they're in recovery now--
they should be okay.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.296
So just Terri died?

34:57.329 --> 34:58.297
Yeah.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.332
Not Sasha?

35:00.366 --> 35:02.534
No.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.270
I don't know how that happened.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.905
It was raining
pretty hard.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.840
Sasha was meaner.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.809
Sorry?

35:10.842 --> 35:13.545
They weren't
very nice to me.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.414
They were never very nice to me.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.615
MAN:
Come on, now...

35:16.648 --> 35:17.749
( child screaming ):
No! No!

35:17.783 --> 35:18.684
Mommy, I'm sorry.
Mommy!

35:18.717 --> 35:19.751
No! No!

35:19.785 --> 35:21.287
It's going to be all right.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.189
Mommy, why are you
letting them do this?

35:23.189 --> 35:23.922
Come on, kids.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.524
Just till I get better.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.592
Everything will be
all right.
Mommy!

35:26.625 --> 35:28.494
MAN:
It's okay!

35:28.527 --> 35:30.662
( screaming )
Everything's going
to be all right.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.797
Mommy, no!

35:31.830 --> 35:32.764
I love you.

35:32.798 --> 35:33.932
It's okay.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.201
No! No!

35:35.201 --> 35:36.268
Mommy!

35:36.302 --> 35:39.471
She left them
alone at night.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.839
Yeah.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.944
What happened?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.446
She coded.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.215
Shocked her twice,
intubated her,

35:49.248 --> 35:50.282
and she converted.

35:50.316 --> 35:51.550
Guess this
rules you out

35:51.583 --> 35:53.752
as the second
signature for her DNR.

35:53.785 --> 35:54.786
It's what she wanted.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.921
Right.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.289
Kerry, I need
to talk to you

35:57.323 --> 35:58.490
about Helen Broznich.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.725
Keep her systolic above 90,

35:59.758 --> 36:01.527
and let's get her
up to the MICU.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.762
It may not be the disease.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.863
What may not be?

36:04.896 --> 36:06.498
What are you
talking about?

36:06.532 --> 36:08.934
Helen hated those girls,
and from what I can tell,

36:08.967 --> 36:10.936
they weren't too crazy
about her either.

36:10.969 --> 36:13.572
Well, teenagers torture
each other in high school.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.241
Believe me, I remember.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.776
Yeah, but they get upset
when they run over classmates.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.646
Her flat affect could definitely
be part of the Wilson's.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.348
Kerry, just because she has
a metabolic disorder

36:22.381 --> 36:23.915
doesn't mean she didn't know
what she was doing.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.453
Are you implying that she
hurt those girls on purpose?

36:27.486 --> 36:30.822
She seems disappointed
that more of them didn't die.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.424
That's what I'm implying.

36:32.458 --> 36:35.261
Dr. Weaver, the appy in
Four is asking for you.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.262
Excuse me.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.563
And your blind date called

36:37.596 --> 36:39.398
and said he'd just
pick you up here.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.666
Fine.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.834
I have a brother
that's single.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.671
Clotted PICC line.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.273
Maybe I missed my turn.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.441
I got up and walked
around for a while.

36:49.475 --> 36:50.709
Uh, here's a tip:

36:50.742 --> 36:53.512
never give up your place
on the waiting list

36:53.545 --> 36:54.613
in a county hospital.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.282
Ah, that's no big deal.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.783
Yeah, it's a huge deal.
Come on.

36:57.816 --> 37:02.488
No, really, it gave me a
chance to, uh, people watch.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.891
Well, that's putting
a positive spin on it.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.993
So, why do you
have a PICC line?

37:08.026 --> 37:13.999
Uh, stage three-C
testicular cancer.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.373
These two should be reviewed
in surgical committee.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.341
You got it.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.310
I remember you.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.944
Rocket.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.679
How'd I do?

37:27.713 --> 37:31.883
Very, very well.

37:31.917 --> 37:35.421
'Cause you promised
you'd take care of me, right?

37:37.356 --> 37:40.726
Get some rest.

37:40.759 --> 37:41.527
Send them to
the Q.A. office?

37:41.560 --> 37:42.761
Yes.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.563
Mr. Dresden can transfer
to 4 west,

37:44.596 --> 37:46.398
and I am going home
to soak my feet.

37:46.432 --> 37:47.566
Donald,
have a minute?

37:47.599 --> 37:49.368
Dr. Romano,
what can I do for you?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.569
Well, I read your memo,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.338
and I think your
concerns are valid.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.739
So, I'm willing to limit

37:53.772 --> 37:55.974
my surgical supervision
to fifth-year residents.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.743
Keep going to physical therapy.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.044
Wait, wait,
look, hear me out.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.447
They already have
all the skills they need,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.715
and I would just be there
to comment and observe

38:03.749 --> 38:04.883
as a... as a formality.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.452
You have physical liabilities.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.953
It'd be one or
two cases a week,

38:07.986 --> 38:10.556
during which I wouldn't
have to lift a finger.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.858
We simply cannot expose patients
or the hospital

38:12.891 --> 38:14.025
to unnecessary risks.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.093
Look, look, look, look.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.762
Just...

38:16.795 --> 38:18.864
keep me on the schedule,
even if it's in name only.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.031
Dr. Romano...

38:20.065 --> 38:22.601
Damn it, please
don't make me beg.

38:22.634 --> 38:26.037
Until your recovery
has progressed further,

38:26.071 --> 38:29.708
let's use your expertise
to help our students.

38:41.853 --> 38:42.988
They ready for us?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.490
Almost.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.091
I'd like to get
a psychiatric consult

38:46.124 --> 38:48.594
before admitting Helen
to the medicine floor

38:48.627 --> 38:50.028
for treatment.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.863
Why?

38:51.897 --> 38:56.602
Mr. Broznich, although
the disease impacts the brain,

38:56.635 --> 39:00.406
it-it doesn't necessarily
explain all behavior.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.873
What do you mean?

39:01.907 --> 39:05.977
Your daughter has the ability
to make decisions.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.646
She goes to school,

39:07.679 --> 39:08.647
she drives a car...

39:08.680 --> 39:10.549
I don't understand.

39:10.582 --> 39:14.085
I think you need to speak
with the police again.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.688
I'm a spastic.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.789
You said that.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.491
No, Helen, I didn't say that.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.693
That's why I hit the gas
and not the brakes.

39:21.727 --> 39:23.028
I'll send the detective in here.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.464
Wait.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.701
It-it's not
the disease?

39:29.735 --> 39:31.570
That will have
to be decided.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.671
It was her?

39:32.704 --> 39:34.606
I don't know.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.875
She-she could
have done this?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.744
I don't know.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.145
Okay, I'm going to inject

39:40.178 --> 39:42.748
something called streptokinase
into your port,

39:42.781 --> 39:46.084
which should dissolve the clot
and make your line functional.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.753
Which is a good thing

39:47.786 --> 39:50.656
because your white blood counts
are almost nonexistent.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.057
I had chemo ten days ago.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.725
Your neutrophils
are below 500,

39:53.759 --> 39:54.926
making you
susceptible

39:54.960 --> 39:56.662
to life-threatening
infection.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.864
The ER's the last place
you should be.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.533
Really?

40:01.567 --> 40:02.634
I kind of like it here.

40:02.668 --> 40:05.671
Okay, now I know you're sick.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.005
When you're
done with this,

40:07.038 --> 40:08.740
you need to go home,
sit tight,

40:08.774 --> 40:09.875
take your temperature

40:09.908 --> 40:11.577
every four hours.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.679
Anything above 100.4,
and you get your butt back here.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.581
Wouldn't it just be easier
to stay?

40:15.614 --> 40:16.615
Nope.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.617
Hey.

40:18.650 --> 40:19.585
You out of here?

40:19.618 --> 40:20.752
Yeah.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.488
Any word?
Nothing.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.489
Is Carter coming back?

40:23.522 --> 40:24.656
No, I told him not to.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.492
You don't have
to be alone tonight

40:26.525 --> 40:29.060
if you don't want to be.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.095
I don't think so.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.763
Call me if you need me.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.633
I'll be fine.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.502
Is that him?

40:38.003 --> 40:40.038
Uh... yeah.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.140
Have fun.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.010
Hi.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.077
( chuckles )

40:46.111 --> 40:47.613
I'm Susan Lewis.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.047
Rick Kelly.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.716
So, you ready to go?

40:50.749 --> 40:53.685
Uh, actually, I have
to stick around with a patient.

40:53.719 --> 40:56.154
Um, uh, a kid
with testicular cancer.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.656
I should have called you.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.758
I drove in
from Lincoln Park.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.593
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.730
Okay, then, uh,
should we reschedule?

41:04.763 --> 41:06.998
Uh, probably not.

41:07.032 --> 41:08.634
Really?

41:08.667 --> 41:10.602
Well, you know,
when you meet someone,

41:10.636 --> 41:12.971
and you can tell if there's
a connection or not?

41:13.004 --> 41:16.575
Um, actually,
I don't want to give up steak.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.043
I'm sorry.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.983
What happened
to your date?

41:25.016 --> 41:27.553
Oh, wasn't meant
to be, I guess.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.755
Let's get you a
shot of neupogen.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.724
( soft moaning )

41:32.758 --> 41:34.693
Did you get new furniture?

41:34.726 --> 41:35.994
Feels different in here.

41:36.027 --> 41:37.062
( Pratt chuckling )

41:37.095 --> 41:38.764
It's less crowded.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.567
Ah, maybe that's it.

41:42.634 --> 41:44.903
You miss him?

41:44.936 --> 41:47.573
Sometimes.

41:47.606 --> 41:51.109
I never lived with anyone,
outside from my parents.

41:51.142 --> 41:52.611
No?

41:52.644 --> 41:55.180
No, they weren't around much.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.750
I guess that's why sometimes
I love my alone time.

41:58.784 --> 41:59.685
( laughs )

41:59.718 --> 42:01.019
Nah, not me.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.921
I grew up around a
whole bunch of cousins

42:02.954 --> 42:04.089
and kids in the projects.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.256
Hmm.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.625
I like it loud.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.760
The more the merrier.

42:08.794 --> 42:11.296
You like kids?

42:11.329 --> 42:12.931
Why do you ask?

42:12.964 --> 42:14.199
I don't know.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.602
You ever think
about having them?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.705
( laughs )

42:19.738 --> 42:21.840
Okay, okay, you're
not the maternal type.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.242
No, no, I-I love kids.

42:24.275 --> 42:27.112
Well, good.
Me, too.

42:27.145 --> 42:32.050
I, uh... I had one.

42:35.253 --> 42:38.223
You have a kid?

42:38.256 --> 42:40.759
I gave him up
for adoption.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.127

by good people.

42:53.805 --> 42:55.741

I guess, um, I wasn't ready.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.854

to go take a shower.

43:10.288 --> 43:13.024
All right?

43:54.165 --> 44:00.138
Mom, are you there?

44:00.171 --> 44:03.775
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't call you back earlier,

44:03.809 --> 44:10.248
uh, but I need
to talk to you now.

44:10.281 --> 44:15.721
Mom, if you're there,
could you please pick up?

44:15.721 --> 44:23.729
Okay, well, uh,

Call me back, I should be home.
