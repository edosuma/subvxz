00:02.080 --> 00:04.040
You know someone's buried there,
at your house.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.800
Two people actually,
right under the building.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.960
What would happen if
one of us moved out

00:07.960 --> 00:09.920
but the other one wanted to stay?

00:09.920 --> 00:13.520
I'd like to have
a relationship with you.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.440
You look perfect.Thank you.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.080
The young woman who
lived here before.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.040
How well did you know her?

00:22.040 --> 00:23.200
Not very well.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.600
We can confirm that the CPS
are going to charge Ray Nelson

00:27.600 --> 00:32.040
with aggravated
burglary and with rape.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.000
I found her things in
a service cupboard,

00:35.000 --> 00:38.720
as though she were hiding in there.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.920
She died in that house.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.040
It was an accident on the stairs.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.520
You're in danger.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.920
SHE GASPS

00:58.120 --> 01:01.280
Have you ever seen
Edward lose his temper?

01:01.280 --> 01:05.120
No. He's quite the
opposite, in fact.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.880
He's always very composed.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.120
Doesn't that strike you as odd?

01:09.120 --> 01:14.960
A person so completely in control
of everything, all the time?

01:14.960 --> 01:21.480
His need for absolute
control, for rules...

01:21.480 --> 01:22.600
Thanks for coming.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.760
I need to talk to you, actually.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.160
Of course.
Let's grab a coffee afterwards.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.680
Can't wait for you to see this.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.000
They're actually shut now,
but I know one of the curators.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.560
Emma's resemblance to his dead wife,

01:34.560 --> 01:37.160
and now your
resemblance to them both...

01:37.160 --> 01:39.240
Hello. Right this way.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.440
Thank you.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.560
..this has all the hallmarks
of "Repetition Compulsion",

01:44.560 --> 01:48.120
acting out the
same sexual psychodrama

01:48.120 --> 01:53.640
again and again, with new players
allotted the same unchanging roles.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.760
And you think
that's happening here?

01:55.760 --> 01:57.320
For a very few people,

01:57.320 --> 02:01.000
these patterns of
behaviour can become extreme.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.400
When a man, possibly Edward,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.960
is challenged or forced to change,

02:06.960 --> 02:10.800
he may become
threatened, even violent.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.680
But I...

02:12.680 --> 02:16.600
..I-I just can't see him
doing anything like that,

02:16.600 --> 02:21.640
especially given
what's happened...recently.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.120
Yes.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.520
You and Emma had both been
through significant traumas

02:26.520 --> 02:28.280
when he chose you.

02:30.040 --> 02:34.680
Have you ever had the sense
of him manipulating you?

02:34.680 --> 02:35.760
No.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.680
He's polite, charming.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.120
Controlling men often are,

02:43.120 --> 02:44.800
but then before you know it,

02:44.800 --> 02:50.960
they're controlling what you wear,
what you do, what you think.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.600
Can you really tell
me you feel safe?

03:38.880 --> 03:40.680
I make it a rule only
to look at one thing

03:40.680 --> 03:42.560
when I visit a museum.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.160
Any more and you
tend to lose focus.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.280
Thank you.

04:00.360 --> 04:04.120
In the Isese tradition,
when you wear the mask of a god,

04:04.120 --> 04:07.360
your weak human spirit vanishes,

04:07.360 --> 04:12.760
and you become capable
of any act, good or evil,

04:12.760 --> 04:14.440
that the god wishes of you.

04:18.960 --> 04:22.160
While we're here, would
you mind breaking your rule

04:22.160 --> 04:25.440
and looking round the
rest of the museum?

04:28.520 --> 04:30.000
I'd rather not.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.400
I'd really like to see it.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.280
This isn't usually on display.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.280
Even so.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.800
Why?

04:45.800 --> 04:47.160
Do I need a reason?

04:49.760 --> 04:52.200
Fine.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.760
If you wish.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.080
This isn't so bad, is it?

05:12.080 --> 05:14.960
So, Folgate Street
is full of surprises.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.280
I found the service cupboard.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.160
I had no idea it was there.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.080
The agent didn't show it you?

05:30.920 --> 05:32.200
No.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.320
Do you think Emma knew about it?

05:42.880 --> 05:44.080
Probably.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.560
What is this about?

05:46.560 --> 05:48.520
Were you and her in a relationship?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.960
Yes.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.520
Why didn't you tell me?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.160
I make it a rule never to discuss...

05:57.160 --> 05:58.520
The rules.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.960
..to talk about people I've
had a relationship with,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.320
however briefly,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.120
feels like a betrayal
of their privacy and trust.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.040
I don't talk about her, just
as I'll never talk about you.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.880
I should've told you.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
I apologise.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.560
You deserve better from me.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.080
Thank you.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.880
I still feel like I know
so little about you.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.680
You're an enigma.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.040
No more than you are to me.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.760
Well done, Emma. That was...

07:01.760 --> 07:05.280
..that was tough.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.680
So the judge has reserved judgment.

07:08.680 --> 07:12.080
She clearly sees
difficulties with our case,

07:12.080 --> 07:14.480
no DNA, no fingerprints.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.840
We weren't expecting for
Emma to be cross-examined,

07:17.840 --> 07:19.360
particularly so soon.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.360
KNOCKING

07:21.960 --> 07:23.800
I just heard that Nelson got bail.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.200
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

07:26.880 --> 07:28.760
Emma, are you OK?

07:30.920 --> 07:32.240
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

07:32.240 --> 07:34.360
We can bring the
video ID line-up forward.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.120
Well, that'd be something.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.640
Getting Nelson's identification
confirmed would definitely help.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.800
Emma?

07:48.440 --> 07:50.160
Oh, Rachel, did you get my email?

07:50.160 --> 07:52.400
Hi, Jane. Sorry, I'm really
late for next meeting.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.320
Um, uh,
let's catch up another time, yeah?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.400
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

08:15.480 --> 08:17.240
KIDS SHOUT AND PLAY IN THE DISTANCE

08:23.560 --> 08:25.120
PHONE RINGS

08:27.160 --> 08:29.640
This is Edward Monkford,
leave a message.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.280
SHE BREATHES SHAKILY

09:08.680 --> 09:10.040
I don't know what to do.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.000
I can barely say the words out loud.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.200
Part of me is thrilled...

09:23.200 --> 09:24.960
..a baby.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.280
But then...

09:30.800 --> 09:33.720
I couldn't go through with
it again, Mia, I couldn't.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.040
Hey, hey.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.480
What if it was my fault?

09:37.480 --> 09:38.680
It's OK.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.480
SHE SNIFFLES

09:43.480 --> 09:45.560
And what are you
going to tell Edward?

09:48.840 --> 09:50.480
I don't know.

09:52.600 --> 09:57.400
I don't know how he's going to
react, given his...background.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.600
Yes, given his background.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.200
What's that mean?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.280
A woman died here.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.880
A woman we now know he was in
some kind of relationship with.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.720
Aren't you even remotely
wondering if he could have had...

10:13.720 --> 10:16.800
..something...to do with it?

10:22.680 --> 10:24.200
I...

10:24.200 --> 10:27.360
..I don't know how I'd ask him.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.600
Then ask someone else.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.720
So, Emma,

10:50.720 --> 10:51.920
they're all set to go.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.440
The video identification
will be done

10:55.440 --> 10:57.840
in the presence of an inspector
unconnected with the case,

10:57.840 --> 10:59.680
plus the defence solicitor. Then...

10:59.680 --> 11:01.520
I don't want to do it.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.120
Right.

11:06.280 --> 11:10.960
Why's that? You told me
that he would plead guilty.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.840
But he's out.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.760
You said it would be over.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.320
The thing is, Emma,

11:23.320 --> 11:25.480
without this identification,

11:25.480 --> 11:28.920
they're very likely
to drop all charges,

11:28.920 --> 11:31.120
even the aggravated
burglary at your flat.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.760
And Nelson does this, Emma,

11:36.760 --> 11:39.760
time and time again.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.200
Gets away with it.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.840
It would just be better for
everyone if he was behind bars.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.360
He shouldn't be allowed to...

11:54.360 --> 11:57.000
I saw him yesterday at court.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.040
I was terrified.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.320
What?

12:05.640 --> 12:08.960
When I went out, he saw me.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.480
HE EXHALES HEAVILY

12:12.960 --> 12:14.600
Were there any witnesses?

12:18.840 --> 12:20.440
Emma...

12:22.640 --> 12:24.720
..we might not have any DNA,

12:24.720 --> 12:28.640
but you're a very credible witness.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.120
And I think the jury
will be on your side.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.920
OK.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.600
OK.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.440
And, um...

12:49.560 --> 12:51.040
..seeing him at court...

12:52.680 --> 12:55.520
..I think that might just undermine
the ID you're about to make.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.760
So let's keep that
between ourselves, yes?

14:24.760 --> 14:27.240
I've looked at all the
information you sent over

14:27.240 --> 14:30.840
and talked it through with
one of the charity's advisers.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.920
I can't help wondering,

14:33.920 --> 14:36.720
had I gone in earlier,

14:36.720 --> 14:40.840
told them I hadn't felt
Isabel move for a while...

14:42.680 --> 14:44.360
..was it something I did?

14:46.040 --> 14:50.680
Something that could
happen again, even?

14:50.680 --> 14:52.480
I need to know.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.200
It says here that you
went in with abdominal pain.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.320
No, I couldn't feel her moving.

15:01.320 --> 15:06.280
The first midwife
asked me if I had pain.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.600
I said a few Braxton Hicks.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.520
Isabel's CTG trace
showed a low heart rate,

15:14.520 --> 15:17.320
at the very bottom
of what's considered normal.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.720
What are you saying?

15:18.720 --> 15:21.320
Coupled with the reduced movement,
that should have resulted

15:21.320 --> 15:24.200
in you having an
immediate ultrasound.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.600
I didn't have an ultrasound.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.840
I suspect the midwife
who did your initial obs

15:30.840 --> 15:34.280
didn't tell the second midwife
the actual reason you came in.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.880
But...why?

15:36.880 --> 15:39.080
Wh-Why wouldn't
she have done that?

15:39.080 --> 15:43.280
The most common problem is
lack of continuity of care.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.040
The second midwife treated
you for abdominal pain.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.120
She sent me home with paracetamol.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.080
But I...I felt her.

15:54.080 --> 16:00.080
I felt Isabel kicking again at home.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.200
I'm afraid that kicking
might have been distress.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.560
I'm so sorry.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.200
I believe that your placenta
was most likely failing,

16:11.200 --> 16:13.880
and they should have
picked up on it.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.960
FAINT: Now if you agree,
I'd like to demand a meeting.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.160
I could come in
with you if you want...

16:36.360 --> 16:38.560
You're quiet.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.280
Are you still upset with me?

16:40.280 --> 16:43.160
Hard day at work, but I'm OK.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.320
There's a box in my bag.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.040
Open it, would you?

17:04.680 --> 17:05.760
What's this?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.040
A gift.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.600
An apology for the other day.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.120
Let me.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.680
It's gorgeous.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.680
Thank you.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.360
Sorry I've been so busy at work
these last few weeks.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.440
But I'm here now.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.600
Thank you.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.560
Are you OK?

17:55.880 --> 17:58.720
Perhaps I should give
you some time alone?

17:58.720 --> 18:00.200
No, I'm...

18:00.200 --> 18:03.680
I'm glad you're here, just...

18:03.680 --> 18:06.520
..wish you could be here more often.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.880
So what's with the bag?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.080
I have to go to
Bristol in the morning.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.760
I have a big project up there.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.000
Why?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.480
Did you think I was moving in?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.080
I could if you want me to.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.360
Really?

18:24.360 --> 18:26.880
Well, we seem to be getting along.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.280
You make me feel like nothing
bad will ever happen again.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.160
What happened to no obligations?

19:03.080 --> 19:07.000
Well, that would remain.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.720
But we do seem to be
getting on well,

19:09.720 --> 19:12.520
and I would like
get to know you more.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.080
Well...

19:18.080 --> 19:21.960
..you could keep a few things here.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.360
If you want.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.400
Well, this is a
cause for celebration.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.360
Housekeeper, play me a slow jam.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.920
MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS

19:43.920 --> 19:47.800
Housekeeper has voice control?

19:47.800 --> 19:50.720
Of course.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.120
As in microphones?
Why didn't you say?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.560
Oh, come on.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.160
There's a microphone on your phone,
on your TV, on your laptop.

19:58.160 --> 20:04.800
Every personal assistant device in
the world, including Housekeeper.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.960
It's hardly a big deal.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.920
How many are there?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.360
I have no idea.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.840
That's Peter's domain.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.320
Peter Creed, how could I forget?

20:15.320 --> 20:17.440
He's not so bad.

20:17.440 --> 20:21.360
Peter's been with me from the start,
and he's incredibly loyal.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.840
How many partners were there?

20:24.840 --> 20:26.120
HE SIGHS

20:27.600 --> 20:31.880
There were only four, me, him,

20:31.880 --> 20:34.480
Elizabeth and Paul.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.320
Paul Ellis.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.640
Any more questions?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.040
Maybe.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.160
Housekeeper, turn up the music!

20:44.160 --> 20:45.920
MUSIC GETS LOUDER

21:03.800 --> 21:05.160
You're leaving?

21:06.520 --> 21:08.480
I have to go to
Bristol for a while.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.320
But you just...

21:11.320 --> 21:13.480
No, stay.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.760
The council want to talk
to me about a new town.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.480
A whole town? Like this.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.440
Yeah.

21:22.440 --> 21:26.120
It's partly what happened to
you that made me consider it.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.920
Instead of building each house

21:27.920 --> 21:32.960
as a refuge against
ugliness and violence,

21:32.960 --> 21:36.160
a community where
everyone can feel safe.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.320
I'd like that.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.160
Maybe you could name it after me.

21:45.160 --> 21:49.280
Maybe I will.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.840
I think you should call in sick.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.200
I can't.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.840
Emma, I can't.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.240
Emma. Please?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.800
I really can't.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.520
You just said that you were
going to...

23:49.520 --> 23:51.400
Look, I got carried away.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.120
I can't get completely
absorbed in this.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.040
When are you coming back?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.080
Not for a while.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.720
Look, it's different for us,
you know that.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.880
I can't afford to fail.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.160
Sure.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.680
Well, bye!

24:17.520 --> 24:21.840
I hope you don't mind me getting
your number from the estate agent.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.600
Thank you for coming.

24:23.600 --> 24:28.000
It's no problem.
It's good to hear from you.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.480
Firstly, I'd like to apologise
for taking those flowers.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.880
It was insensitive of me.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.640
Forget it, really.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.400
Flowers won't bring her back.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.200
If I can stop someone else

24:42.200 --> 24:45.320
from going through
what she went through...

24:45.320 --> 24:46.600
Right.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.040
When you came to
the house that time,

24:53.040 --> 24:57.040
you implied her death
might have been suspicious.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.080
It was.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.720
Well, it still is.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.320
How so?

25:04.320 --> 25:07.880
She was being manipulated,
right from the start.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.000
Manipulated by whom?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.360
The landlord.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.520
Edward Monkford?

25:14.520 --> 25:17.720
It started off as...romantic.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.360
But a few days before she died,

25:21.360 --> 25:24.640
she told me he completely lost it.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.440
He terrified her.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.320
Wait. You think he...?

25:28.320 --> 25:30.080
He killed her, yes.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.480
But...the police must
have investigated.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.080
It was an open verdict,

25:39.080 --> 25:41.080
lack of evidence.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.200
They couldn't be sure

25:42.200 --> 25:44.200
that she didn't throw
herself down the stairs,

25:44.200 --> 25:46.240
but Em wouldn't have done that.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.600
Not that they cared by then.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.320
I called Clarke, but
he didn't want to know.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.680
Uh, DI Clarke, he's
a useless piece of shit.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.240
You should have seen
what she was like

25:58.240 --> 26:00.920
in those last few
weeks before she died.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.520
It was all kicking off.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.920
Amanda wasn't
talking to her at work,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.320
Monkford was filling
her head with rubbish.

26:07.320 --> 26:12.520
Things are no longer perfect,
people are like houses, um,

26:12.520 --> 26:14.160
blah, blah, bullshit.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.240
Are you OK?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.440
Yes, fine.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.600
Yeah, mate, our place,
not a problem.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.360
I can do you...?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.520
Amanda. Hey. What's going on?

26:40.520 --> 26:42.600
Are you OK?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.360
Not really, no.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.360
Trouble with working at the
same company as your husband

26:48.360 --> 26:50.560
is that when it all goes wrong,

26:50.560 --> 26:53.400
it goes wrong right in your face.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.080
Saul's been at it again.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.520
What happened?

26:59.120 --> 27:02.920
I should've known he
couldn't keep it in his pants.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.720
That girl in marketing, Leona.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.440
And he's been going out
clubbing with Simon too.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.000
Said it was to get
him back on his feet,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
but, ironic because all
Simon does is moan on about

27:18.000 --> 27:19.640
getting back with you.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.120
He adores you.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.840
Yeah, well,

27:26.840 --> 27:30.560
maybe being adored by needy
boys isn't my thing any more.

27:32.560 --> 27:37.840
Maybe I need
someone more...my equal.

We've had a chance to review
the full notes and scans,

32:42.400 --> 32:47.280
and we believe that Jane's pregnancy
at 39 weeks was mishandled,

32:47.280 --> 32:50.520
probably due to a lack
of continuity in care.

have already been

32:52.280 --> 32:54.120

32:54.120 --> 32:56.280
and the cause of
death is unexplained.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.680
Except I'd gone in with reduced
movement instead of abdominal pain,

33:00.680 --> 33:01.920
as was stated in my notes.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.960
The actual cause
of death is uncertain.

Baby was already very
poorly when mum came in.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.880
Her name is Isabel.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.480
And my name isn't "Mum".

33:15.000 --> 33:16.920
I get the impression
what you'd most like

33:16.920 --> 33:18.800
is an apology, is that right?

33:18.800 --> 33:20.680
Would an
acknowledgement of everything

33:20.680 --> 33:22.280
that you and Isabel went through

33:22.280 --> 33:24.880
help you achieve some
closure for your loss?

33:24.880 --> 33:27.080
What Isabel went through?

33:27.080 --> 33:28.480
She died.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.520
But...

33:32.520 --> 33:37.400
..she should have
been here, right now,

33:37.400 --> 33:38.840
strapped into her buggy.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.960
I did note the discrepancy.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.560
Then why didn't you say?

33:50.480 --> 33:53.960
Didn't want to add to your distress,

33:53.960 --> 33:56.640
because it may not have made
a difference to Isabel's outcome.

33:56.640 --> 34:00.400
It would've made a
difference to how I feel.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.680
I've been blaming myself.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.360
Could I have been more diligent,

34:07.360 --> 34:10.000
more caring, done better?

35:16.320 --> 35:19.520
OK, can someone please
tell me what's going on?

35:21.200 --> 35:23.440
As you probably know,
it's requirement these days

35:23.440 --> 35:27.440
for the prosecution and defence to
share information before a trial

35:27.440 --> 35:30.560
to prevent cases coming
to court unnecessarily.

35:32.240 --> 35:36.880
Ray Nelson is claiming
misidentification.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.960
The meta data on your
phone has now been analysed,

35:39.960 --> 35:43.680
something my officers hadn't
seen fit to prioritise.

35:44.840 --> 35:50.400
It shows a video was recorded five
days before the alleged assault,

35:50.400 --> 35:53.080
a date for which
Nelson has an alibi.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.960
Be very careful what
you say next, Emma.

36:01.320 --> 36:05.080
Did Ray Nelson force you to give
him oral sex at knife-point?

36:09.040 --> 36:10.840
Emma?

36:17.040 --> 36:19.720
No. Did Ray Nelson sexually
assault you in any way

36:19.720 --> 36:22.160
when he burgled your house
and stole your phone?

36:26.320 --> 36:27.560
No.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.200
Emma Matthews, you do not have to
say anything, but if you do... No!

36:37.200 --> 36:39.280
..mention when questioned
something you later....

36:39.280 --> 36:40.600
No, no, no! What's happening?!

36:40.600 --> 36:44.600
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence. No, no, no!

36:44.600 --> 36:47.840
We take cases of
rape very seriously, Emma,

36:47.840 --> 36:49.680
which means starting
from the assumption

36:49.680 --> 36:54.000
that every woman who reports a
sexual assault is telling the truth.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.480
The flip side of that?

36:55.480 --> 36:58.960
We take false allegations
equally seriously.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.400
You wrote a victim statement.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.840
You went up on front of a judge.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.040
Why say all of this
if it wasn't Nelson?

37:05.040 --> 37:07.960
Because you asked me
in front of Simon!

37:12.560 --> 37:15.280
And yet you passed up
countless opportunities

37:15.280 --> 37:18.360
to tell us what really happened.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.680
Well, he needed to
be off the streets!

37:20.680 --> 37:26.160
You made me do the ID,
you...you knew he'd seen me!

37:26.160 --> 37:29.080
You said it wouldn't go to trial.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.200
Emma...were you raped?

37:32.200 --> 37:35.680
Yes! By who? No!
Can you tell us a name?

37:35.680 --> 37:39.080
I just want to go now.
Can I go, please?

37:39.080 --> 37:42.080
Open a new rape
investigation, please.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
Can I go home now, please?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.560
No, I'm afraid it's not
as easy as that, Emma.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.840
Do you have a solicitor?

37:55.200 --> 37:56.560
We're going to arrest you now,

37:56.560 --> 37:59.720
which means you'll have
access to a duty solicitor.

37:59.720 --> 38:00.960
SHE SNIFFLES

38:07.920 --> 38:11.200
Emma, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of perjury,

38:11.200 --> 38:14.480
attempting to pervert the course of
justice and wasting police time.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.080
Do you understand?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.320
SHE SOBS

38:19.800 --> 38:24.000
Emma, I need you to answer.
Do you understand?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.240
Yes.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.400
SOBBING CONTINUES

38:37.200 --> 38:39.560
So she was raped,

38:39.560 --> 38:40.960
just not by Nelson.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.840
There was a video on her phone.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.000
We...

38:47.920 --> 38:50.280
I thought it might be Nelson.

38:50.280 --> 38:52.480
She appeared to confirm it.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.160
We didn't have enough time
to do the relevant checks.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.520
The jury would've been eating
out of the palm of her hand,

39:00.520 --> 39:02.760
that's for sure.

39:02.760 --> 39:07.080
And she was clearly traumatised,

39:07.080 --> 39:10.600
but we weren't able to obtain
evidence on either identification

39:10.600 --> 39:11.920
or lack of consent.

39:11.920 --> 39:16.040
She just wouldn't give
us any information.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.000
She was probably terrified.

39:19.480 --> 39:23.160
Emma was arrested for
wasting police time, perjury.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.040
I put my neck on the
line for that girl.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.640
I—I wanted to help her.

39:29.640 --> 39:30.800
And her death?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.240
Did you investigate that?

39:35.560 --> 39:38.960
DS Willan handled that.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.600
I'd...retired.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.720
Didn't fancy all the retraining
my boss was going to put me through

39:45.720 --> 39:48.960
after such a...cock-up.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.680
They did look into it, though.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.760
Interviewed her former
partner after she died,

39:58.760 --> 40:01.360
given that she'd made
an accusation he was abusive.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.000
Edward Monkford? No, Simon.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.160
Simon Wakefield.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.480
Sami Ahmed, your solicitor.

40:19.480 --> 40:23.360
I'm afraid the other rooms were in
use. We'll have to talk in here.

40:23.360 --> 40:28.040
Thing is, Emma, these charges
will continue to be dealt with

40:28.040 --> 40:33.720
under RASSO guidelines, that's Rape
and Serious Sexual Offences.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.680
They have some particular
stipulations that don't apply

40:37.680 --> 40:39.440
in other circumstances.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.320
Not loopholes as such, but...

40:46.400 --> 40:53.280
Sometimes I've acted on behalf of
women who may have felt pressured

40:54.520 --> 40:57.960
into making or withdrawing a
rape accusation, for example.

40:59.080 --> 41:03.840
Perhaps they were frightened
of someone's reaction,

41:03.840 --> 41:07.560
a partner, for example.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.600
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

41:11.600 --> 41:13.400
You mean...

41:14.920 --> 41:18.320
..if I were afraid to tell someone,

41:18.320 --> 41:20.840
you can make this all go away?

41:20.840 --> 41:24.880
It would certainly help,
a lot, actually.

41:24.880 --> 41:29.320
Perjury can carry a custodian
sentence, that's prison.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.520
I was afraid to tell Simon.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.840
That's why I said what I said.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.880
Right.

41:41.120 --> 41:46.440
But it's not enough to be afraid
of someone's normal reaction,

41:46.440 --> 41:52.280
you see, but
if...they've been violent,

41:52.280 --> 41:57.560
coercive, controlling,

41:57.560 --> 42:01.200
That's the kind of thing that
would make the difference.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.720
It's not as if anything
would happen to him,

42:07.720 --> 42:09.200
not without evidence.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.920
Clever brief, most likely.

42:19.640 --> 42:21.400
I've been around a lot
of criminals in my time

42:21.400 --> 42:25.680
but Simon Wakefield, abusive?

42:25.680 --> 42:28.040
Didn't strike me as the type.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.280
So was Emma's rapist ever found?

42:32.320 --> 42:34.920
Like I said, Nelson was my case.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.480
And what about her death?

42:39.480 --> 42:41.480
Surely there were other suspects?

42:41.480 --> 42:43.360
It wasn't a murder case.

42:43.360 --> 42:47.600
It looked like an
accident or suicide.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.720
Ray Nelson was questioned
too, of course.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.360
Emma was window
dressing, wasn't she?

42:56.880 --> 43:00.280
A beautiful, traumatised
victim to help convict your guy

43:00.280 --> 43:02.120
on the other counts.

43:02.120 --> 43:05.200
Nelson's a dangerous individual.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.640
Getting him sent down
for aggravated burglary

43:07.640 --> 43:11.000
would have been a very
good day at the office.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.040
You were never
really interested in her.

43:14.040 --> 43:16.040
No-one protected her,

43:16.040 --> 43:17.480
and then she died.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.280
She deserved better.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.880
Last time I came here,
you implied that Edward

43:38.880 --> 43:43.640
might have been
responsible for Emma's death.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.280
I need to know if you have
any actual proof of that.

43:46.280 --> 43:49.280
You're very interested in
Edward and Emma, Jane.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.800
Why is that do you think?

43:53.840 --> 43:57.480
I'm...pregnant.

43:57.480 --> 43:58.920
It's his.

44:05.080 --> 44:08.600
And how do you feel about that?

44:08.600 --> 44:11.680
I need to decide
whether to keep it or...

44:14.840 --> 44:17.040
I know you said I
should stay away from him

44:17.040 --> 44:18.960
but this changes things.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.760
He needs to be part of the decision.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.640
I suspect he won't be happy.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.680
The deal was an
unencumbered relationship.

44:29.080 --> 44:31.320
I don't even know if he's
ready to be a father again.

44:31.320 --> 44:34.760
I asked about your
feelings Jane, not his.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.160
You mentioned before
you'd lost a child.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.440
Yes.

44:47.840 --> 44:51.040
And I do...feel...

44:52.600 --> 44:55.800
..there's a crazy sense of...guilt.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.760
There's a...

45:02.760 --> 45:04.320
..if...

45:06.400 --> 45:07.840
..if I have this baby...

45:10.840 --> 45:15.120
I'd be betraying her.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.240
Killing her almost.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.960
Because on some level you would be.

45:24.280 --> 45:27.560
Your feelings make
perfect sense, Jane.

45:28.600 --> 45:32.200
Isabel now exists
only in your memories

45:32.200 --> 45:36.040
and your continuing love for her.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.640
It's only natural.

45:41.640 --> 45:44.440
This quest for Emma's truth,

45:44.440 --> 45:47.320
could it be partly because
you still haven't processed

45:47.320 --> 45:51.000
your feelings about
Isabel, do you think?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.080
A kind of distraction.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.600
I spoke to the police.

45:54.600 --> 45:58.160
They clearly failed her in some way.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.600
SHE SNIFFLES

46:02.840 --> 46:06.920
There was more to it than just
the false accusation, wasn't there?

46:06.920 --> 46:11.440
Emma's sexual history is something
I definitely can't discuss.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.360
But you're right,
there was more to it.

46:18.280 --> 46:22.880
Think about yourself and how
your feelings from Isabel's death

46:22.880 --> 46:26.560
got overlaid onto the
conception of another child.

46:27.920 --> 46:31.040
Traumatic emotions are like water.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.800
They have a knack of locating the
cracks and finding a way out.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.280
Poor girl.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.440
Everyone let her down.

46:50.440 --> 46:54.520
Her partners, her friends,

46:54.520 --> 46:56.280
including you.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.400
Including me.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.240
You asked me whether
I have any proof

47:10.240 --> 47:13.680
whether Edward Monkford
was a threat to Emma...

47:15.200 --> 47:18.840
She asked me the
exact same question,

47:18.840 --> 47:23.120
and I didn't have a
definitive answer for her either.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.280
But do you really want to risk it,

47:26.280 --> 47:27.520
especially now?

47:29.680 --> 47:33.840
Wouldn't the safest thing
still be to just walk away?

48:15.160 --> 48:16.800
Jane?

48:16.800 --> 48:18.960
Amanda. Thanks for meeting me.

48:18.960 --> 48:21.560
Uh, I can't stay long,
I have to get back to work.

48:25.120 --> 48:30.040
Do you, uh, really live
in that crazy house, then?

48:30.040 --> 48:31.280
Yes, I do.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.680
So you and Emma were good friends?

48:35.680 --> 48:38.920
Were friends, yeah, um...

48:38.920 --> 48:40.280
..but she changed.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.520
How so?

48:43.040 --> 48:45.440
Once she got together
with that architect,

48:45.440 --> 48:47.960
lived in the house, dumped Simon...

48:49.440 --> 48:52.680
..he and my husband,
Saul, were best mates.

48:52.680 --> 48:56.080
We used to go out all the time,
the four of us,

48:56.080 --> 49:00.800
but, uh, then it stopped.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.520
Must've been hard,

49:03.520 --> 49:08.760
her being with someone else when
you were all such good friends.

49:10.840 --> 49:12.280
It wasn't just that.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.280
We had an argument
just before she died.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.200
I went off at her.

49:25.160 --> 49:28.760
What was it about?

49:28.760 --> 49:35.360
Nothing, um, it seems so silly now.

49:40.520 --> 49:44.640
And what about
everything she went through?

49:46.280 --> 49:48.280
The business with the police?

49:48.280 --> 49:52.360
Oh, look, I don't, um,
want to get into all that.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.440
I really do have to get back.
Of course.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.920

50:22.880 --> 50:24.320

53:06.240 --> 53:08.320
Excuse me.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.600
DI Clarke here.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.040
There's paint everywhere.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.280
Why are you calling
me on this number?

53:15.280 --> 53:17.040
You gave it to me.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.440
You said to call you if I had any...

53:18.440 --> 53:20.160
Look, the
circumstances have changed.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.120
If you need to report a crime,
call the appropriate number.

SHE CRIES

54:00.720 --> 54:03.080
Excuse me, are you DS Willan?

54:03.080 --> 54:04.920
DI Willan. Yeah, that's me.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.440
Can I have a quick word? What about?

54:07.440 --> 54:08.760
Emma Matthews.

54:08.760 --> 54:11.480
If you've got any new
information you can call 101.

54:11.480 --> 54:15.960
No, I don't have information,
I'm looking for some.

54:17.040 --> 54:20.720
Look, I don't know if
this is allowed but,

54:20.720 --> 54:23.920
I'm living at 1 Folgate Street,

54:23.920 --> 54:26.560
and I've become concerned.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.800
I met your old boss, DI Clarke.

54:29.800 --> 54:32.760
I know there was an accusation
against Simon Wakefield,

54:32.760 --> 54:36.880
but what about the other
partner, Edward Monkford?

54:36.880 --> 54:38.120
Did he have an alibi?

54:38.120 --> 54:40.280
I really can't discuss these
kind of details with you,

54:40.280 --> 54:42.800
I'm sorry. Excuse me.Please!

54:42.800 --> 54:43.840
I'm...

54:45.320 --> 54:49.560
..I'm in a relationship
with him, and...

54:49.560 --> 54:51.560
..I'm expecting his child.

54:55.240 --> 55:00.600
You can set your mind
at rest, he had an alibi.

55:00.600 --> 55:04.640
What was it, if you don't
mind me asking, the alibi?

55:04.640 --> 55:07.840
Uh, a colleague if
I remember correctly.

55:07.840 --> 55:11.560
Creed. They were together.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.520
I hope that's reassured you.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.480
FAINT SIRENS

55:25.840 --> 55:27.480
PHONE VIBRATES

55:30.440 --> 55:32.680
Hey.

55:32.680 --> 55:34.600
Hey. Just checking in.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.800
How's everything at Folgate Street?

55:36.800 --> 55:39.640
Pristine as ever.

55:39.640 --> 55:43.000
I wouldn't have
expected anything less.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.760
When are you coming back?

55:45.760 --> 55:47.440
Not for a while.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.360
I'm having to explain
to the building officers

55:49.360 --> 55:52.040
why I won't be
installing safety lighting.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.000
I miss you.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.960
I miss you too.
