on the entire perimeter
of this tattoo,

38:36.397 --> 38:38.232
there's not a consistent spot
within itself.

38:38.315 --> 38:40.901
- I didn't want it to be one
perfectly clean line--

38:40.985 --> 38:43.237
- But you also don't want it
to be one clean mess.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.905
- Would you say
that that looks more

38:44.989 --> 38:46.574
like a galaxy than Austin's?

38:46.657 --> 38:47.950
- I think Austin's,
if you look at space,

38:48.034 --> 38:50.202
I don't think it's very well
thought out how it finishes,

38:50.286 --> 38:52.413
because the spiral's
going one way,

38:52.496 --> 38:54.165
and then as soon as
it hits the panther neck,

38:54.248 --> 38:55.666
it's just some [bleep]
going a different way.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.209
- I mean, galaxies come
from infinite,

38:57.293 --> 38:58.878
so they're infinite shapes,
infinite sizes.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.379
Because you haven't seen
that one doesn't mean

39:00.463 --> 39:01.922
there's not one
that looks like that.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.132
- I think everybody
that's gonna look at it

39:03.215 --> 39:04.717
is gonna think
that it is a galaxy.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.302
- So let me put you
in a position,

39:06.385 --> 39:08.721
because both galaxies,
potentially [bleep].

39:08.804 --> 39:09.930
{\an1}- Austin's galaxy's
way more [bleep] than Jess'.

39:10.014 --> 39:10.765
- Yeah, come on.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.475
- So who's animal's better?

39:12.558 --> 39:14.060
{\an8}- You can't tell me
the technical aspect

39:14.143 --> 39:16.270
{\an8}of the outline on Jess'
is good.

39:16.353 --> 39:17.646
{\an8}I think the wolf is beat.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.357
{\an8}- The cat's face does not have
as many anatomical issues

39:20.441 --> 39:23.319
{\an8}as the sideways face
of the wolf.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.695
{\an8}My vote's for Jess.

elements of Jess' tattoo are.

I know it's a galaxy,
and I know it's a wolf.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.994
When I go to Austin's tattoo,

39:32.078 --> 39:34.663
it's a cat with some kind
of questionable spinner

39:34.747 --> 39:35.373
