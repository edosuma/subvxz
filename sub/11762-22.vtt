WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:03.474
SO WHAT DID YOU DO
LAST NIGHT?

00:03.474 --> 00:07.007
OH, I TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF A LONELY, VULNERABLE WOMAN.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.080
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.083
HEY, DID YOU LIKE IT WHEN
I KISSED THE BACK OF YOUR KNEE?

00:12.083 --> 00:16.187
WOMEN DON'T KNOW IT, BUT THAT'S
A MAJOR EROGENOUS ZONE.
SO SEXY.

00:16.187 --> 00:19.450
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS A LOT--
WERE YOU UP ALL NIGHT, TOO?

00:19.450 --> 00:21.452
OH, NO, I'M A GUY.

00:21.452 --> 00:25.096
BY "A LOT," I MEAN THE FIVE
MINUTES I'VE BEEN AWAKE.
MY BAD. GO ON.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.198
I DON'T MAKE FRIENDS EASILY,

00:27.198 --> 00:30.131
AND THIS--THIS LITTLE GROUP
OF OURS...

00:30.131 --> 00:33.364
THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW.
YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA CALL 'EM
THAT. UM, THIS LITTLE GROUP...

00:33.364 --> 00:37.168
THE CREW.
RIGHT. WELL, UM,
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME,

00:37.168 --> 00:39.640
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.042
I DON'T WANT TO
MESS THAT UP.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.814
I DON'T EITHER.

00:43.814 --> 00:47.278
MAYBE THIS SHOULD JUST BE
A-A ONETIME DEAL.

00:47.278 --> 00:51.051
OR... WE COULD
JUST BE FRIENDS...

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
(under breath) WITH BENEFITS.

00:53.053 --> 00:57.088
OH, YOU SNUCK THAT IN
AT THE END, DIDN'T YA?

00:57.088 --> 00:59.090
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS--
THE OLD F.W.B.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.392
THAT IS THE GREATEST MALE MYTH
OF OUR TIME.

01:01.392 --> 01:04.365
I MEAN, THAT AND OUR KNEES
BEING AN EROGENOUS ZONE.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.367
IT IS.
IT'S NOT. IT'S A KNEE.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.770
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY F.W.B. NEVER WORKS?

01:09.770 --> 01:13.804
NO.
WE'RE FRIENDS.
IT CAN'T BE CASUAL.

01:13.804 --> 01:16.607
FRIEND SEX COMES
WITH FEELINGS AND BAGGAGE,

01:16.607 --> 01:19.480
AND SOMEONE ALWAYS GETS HURT.
IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.284
(Laurie)
JULES, IT'S COFFEE TIME!
STAY HERE.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.117
(lowered voice)
BUT I LOVE COFFEE TIME.

01:26.117 --> 01:28.619
(Ellie) IT'S 7:45.

01:28.619 --> 01:32.663
HOW COME COME YOU'RE NOT
DOWN HERE ALREADY SERVING US?
(thud)

01:32.663 --> 01:34.195
HEY, GANG.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.497
AAH! DON'T DO THAT.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.400
в™Є MAKING COFFEE FOR MY FRIENDS в™Є

01:39.400 --> 01:43.134
в™Є THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE
IN THE MORNING в™Є

01:43.134 --> 01:45.476
(laughter)

01:45.476 --> 01:49.240
WHAT?
YOU ONLY SING-NARRATE YOUR LIFE
WHEN YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.183
LET'S PLAY THE ADMISSION GAME.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.185
THAT'S WHEN FRIENDS ADMIT STUFF,

01:54.185 --> 01:56.487
AND IT BRINGS EVERYONE
MUCH CLOSER.

01:56.487 --> 01:59.220
I READ ABOUT IT IN A MAGAZINE.
WHAT MAGAZINE?

01:59.220 --> 02:02.223
FINE! IT'S JUST--I FEEL LIKE
PEOPLE RESPECT MY IDEAS MORE

02:02.223 --> 02:04.825
WHEN THEY THINK THAT
THEY CAME OUT OF MAGAZINES.
NOPE.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.758
I'LL GO FIRST
BECAUSE I GOT NOTHING TO HIDE.

02:07.758 --> 02:10.161
ELLIE,
LAST WEEK I DROPPED STAN.

02:10.161 --> 02:13.164
HE GOT GOOGLY EYES FOR A SECOND,
BUT THEN THEY WENT RIGHT BACK.

02:13.164 --> 02:14.905
WHATEVS.

02:14.905 --> 02:17.908
ONCE, WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP,
I KISSED YOU ON THE FOREHEAD

02:17.908 --> 02:21.242
'CAUSE I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE NICE DREAMS.
NO, I KNOW. I WAS AWAKE.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.914
OH, FEELS LIKE THE GAME
SHOULD BE OVER.

02:23.914 --> 02:27.147
COME ON! DON'T YOU GUYS WANT
TO GET INSIDE EACH OTHER?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.649
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
(laughs)

02:28.649 --> 02:30.150
OH HO HO!
(laughs)

02:30.150 --> 02:33.184
BING-BING-BING-BING-
BING-BING-BING!
SO LAME.

02:33.184 --> 02:35.886
WHY WON'T THAT JOKE
EVER GO AWAY?

02:35.886 --> 02:39.260
WE SHOULD STEAL IT FROM THEM
SO THEY KNOW HOW ANNOYING IT IS.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.532
(chuckles) GOOD LUCK, SISTERS.
NOT THAT EASY.

02:41.532 --> 02:43.534
IT'S NEVER HARD FOR ME.

02:43.534 --> 02:47.198
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. WHOO!
OH! (speaks gibberish)

02:47.198 --> 02:49.700
(speaks gibberish)
HA!

02:49.700 --> 02:51.372
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.348
ARE WE HERE TO BUY ME A CAR
FOR COLLEGE?

02:57.348 --> 02:58.909
(laughs) GOOD ONE, TRAV.

02:58.909 --> 03:00.481
THANKS.

03:00.481 --> 03:03.254
YOU KNOW HOW I'VE BEEN WORKING
ODD JOBS FOR EXTRA CASH?

03:03.254 --> 03:05.756
I REALLY
GOTTA GET TO SCHOOL.
YOU WILL.

03:05.756 --> 03:08.489
I JUST HAVE TO DROP MR. ROCKWELL
OFF AT THE MALL FIRST.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.421
I'M GONNA BUY PANTS.

03:10.421 --> 03:12.423
WELL, I'M TRYING TO SCRAPE
TOGETHER ENOUGH DOUGH

03:12.423 --> 03:14.425
TO GET MY BOAT
BACK IN THE WATER.

03:14.425 --> 03:16.427
AND AS A PROMOTION,
THIS PLACE IS RELEASING

03:16.427 --> 03:18.429
A BALLOON
WITH 2,000 BUCKS IN IT.

03:18.429 --> 03:20.431
DAD, YOU CAN'T PUT
ALL YOUR FINANCIAL HOPES

03:20.431 --> 03:21.932
INTO BALLOON CHASING.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.935
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA KEEP BUYING
THOSE LOTTERY TICKETS.

03:24.935 --> 03:27.207
I'M JUST KIDDING.
DON'T DO THAT.

03:28.539 --> 03:29.780
(groans)

03:29.780 --> 03:32.743
WHAT?
I WANT OUR JOKE BACK.

03:32.743 --> 03:34.945
OH, IT'S NOT YOUR JOKE
ANYMORE.

03:34.945 --> 03:39.219
I GOT YOU A PRESENT, BUT I'M NOT
EVEN GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU NOW.
YES, YOU ARE.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.352
I KNOW. I'M TOO EXCITED.

03:41.352 --> 03:44.355
I HIRED A NANNY. I KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA SAY WE DON'T NEED IT,

03:44.355 --> 03:46.357
BUT IT'S ONLY THREE DAYS
A WEEK.

03:46.357 --> 03:48.359
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE FOR YOU

03:48.359 --> 03:51.502
TO HAVE SOME HELP AROUND
THE HOUSE AND NOT BE TIED DOWN.

03:51.502 --> 03:54.265
AND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ELLIE.

03:56.407 --> 04:00.411
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE FOR ME.

04:00.411 --> 04:01.942
OH, STOP.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.315
IT'S JUST A TINY THING.

04:04.315 --> 04:06.317
(whispers)
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

04:06.317 --> 04:08.919
YOU RUINED IT!
YOU RUINED MY GIFT!

04:08.919 --> 04:10.481
STOP IT.

04:10.481 --> 04:11.982
NOTHING WRONG WITH LOOKING.

04:11.982 --> 04:14.725
I SMELL LOVERS.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.827
NO, YOU DON'T, BARB.

04:16.827 --> 04:19.890
OH, THE AIR'S SO THINK WITH
PHEROMONES, I CAN BARELY SEE.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.031
(chuckles)

04:21.031 --> 04:23.033
EVERY HAIR ON MY BODY

04:23.033 --> 04:25.936
WOULD BE STANDING ON END
IF I WEREN'T SHAVED BALD FROM...

04:25.936 --> 04:27.498
HERE DOWN.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.376
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GETTING A NANNY.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.748
I MEAN, I JUST HAD
TO PUT MY EGO ASIDE

04:37.748 --> 04:40.050
AND REALIZE I CAN'T DO IT ALL
BY MYSELF.

04:40.050 --> 04:42.753
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?

04:42.753 --> 04:44.014
OH... CORPORATE ATTORNEY.

04:44.014 --> 04:45.916
(laughs) NO, NO, HONEY.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.419
HE'S ASKING WHAT YOU DO NOW,

04:48.419 --> 04:50.461
NOT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

04:50.461 --> 04:53.594
SHE'S VERY, VERY BUSY TAKING
CARE OF ALL OF HER CHILDREN.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.066
OH. HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU HAVE?

04:56.066 --> 04:59.870
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE, DON'T YOU?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

04:59.870 --> 05:02.833
FOR FUN.
SO I DON'T WORK
AND I HAVE A NANNY.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.076
I DON'T HAVE TO
BE EMBARRASSED.
(gasps) AFTER YEARS
OF TAKING YOUR ABUSE,

05:06.076 --> 05:08.078
I'VE FINALLY FOUND
YOUR WEAK SPOT.

05:08.078 --> 05:10.941
JULES! HONEY,
I'VE FOUND HER WEAK SPOT.

05:10.941 --> 05:15.846
OH, YOU MEAN THAT CHEESY
DOLPHIN TATTOO ON HER BUTT?

05:15.846 --> 05:19.420
Y-YOU DIDN'T MEAN THAT, DID YOU?
WELL, SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.693
IT'S MY SPIRIT GUIDE.

05:22.693 --> 05:25.426
HEY, JULES. YOU LEFT
YOUR SUNGLASSES AT THE BAR.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.897
THANK YOU.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.102
2 FOR 2.

05:32.102 --> 05:33.634
(chuckles)

05:33.634 --> 05:35.406
(amplified voice) READY? TEN...

05:35.406 --> 05:37.408
I'M HERE.
LET'S DO A HANDS-IN.

05:37.408 --> 05:38.969
ANDY, THERE'S NO TIME.

05:38.969 --> 05:40.971
(groans)
OKAY, HANDS IN.

05:40.971 --> 05:43.113
ALL RIGHT, REMEMBER,
THE MONEY'S IN THE RED BALLOON.

05:43.113 --> 05:46.377
HURT PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE TO.
WE CAN APOLOGIZE LATER.
GOD HELP ME,
I ENJOY YOU, DAD.

05:46.377 --> 05:48.449
ALL RIGHT, BALLOON!
(Andy and Travis) BALLOON!

05:48.449 --> 05:51.351
...TWO, ONE! GO GET IT!

05:51.351 --> 05:54.785
(cheering)

05:58.429 --> 06:00.861
THIS WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.863
OKAY, DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHY

06:02.863 --> 06:05.966
I THINK THAT WE CAN PULL OFF
BEING FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS?

06:05.966 --> 06:07.898
HELL, YEAH, I DO.

06:07.898 --> 06:09.369
WE'RE FRIENDS.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.702
WE CAN KEEP IT CASUAL.
IT CAN'T BE CASUAL.

06:11.702 --> 06:14.705
PLUS, FRIEND SEX IS
THE MOST FUN. YOU KNOW IT.
FRIEND SEX COMES WITH FEELINGS
AND--AND BAGGAGE,

06:14.705 --> 06:17.708
AND SOMEONE ALWAYS GETS HURT.
I MEAN--
I MEAN, WE'RE SMART ENOUGH

06:17.708 --> 06:20.711
NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES
EVERYONE ELSE MAKES.
AND EVERYONE THINKS THEY CAN
AVOID FALLING INTO THAT TRAP,

06:20.711 --> 06:23.584
BUT THEY CAN'T.
IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA.
LET'S DO THIS.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.456
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

06:25.456 --> 06:28.118
BUT ONE THING--LET'S STILL
JUST KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.761
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

06:30.761 --> 06:33.494
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE DONE.
I GOT YOUR TEXT.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.995
WHAT? SHE DOESN'T COUNT.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.998
в™Єв™Є

06:48.078 --> 06:52.142
SO YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY
GONNA TRY IT? THE OLD F.W.B.?

06:52.142 --> 06:54.144
YEP. NO GUILT.
NO COMMITMENT.

06:54.144 --> 06:58.118
OH, WAIT. HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW
WHEN IT'S, YOU KNOW, GOING DOWN?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.790
I COULD POLITELY SAY,

06:59.790 --> 07:01.522
"SHALL WE?"

07:01.522 --> 07:05.456
AND IF I'M IN THE MOOD, I CAN
CURTSY AND SAY, "INDEED."

07:05.456 --> 07:06.857
VERY CLASSY.

07:06.857 --> 07:09.129
WHAT ABOUT POST-SEX CUDDLING?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.031
OH.
THIS ONE NEEDS IT.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.964
SHE HOLDS ON LIKE AN OTTER
TRYING TO BREAK OPEN A CLAM.

07:13.964 --> 07:18.108
THAT'S WHY ELLIE WILL BE
MY SURROGATE AFTERGLOW PARTNER.

07:18.108 --> 07:19.970
YAY! SO FUN.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.713
UH-HUH. I'M GONNA OTTER
THE HELL OUT OF YOU.

07:22.713 --> 07:24.715
I DON'T SEE THE BALLOON.

07:24.715 --> 07:27.718
WELL, EVEN IF YOU DID, HOW ARE
WE GONNA LOSE EVERYONE ELSE?

07:27.718 --> 07:30.721
COME ON, MAN. YOU THINK THIS IS
MY FIRST MONEY BALLOON CHASE?

07:30.721 --> 07:33.023
OKAY, IT IS, BUT STILL,
I SET UP A DIVERSION.

07:33.023 --> 07:35.486
I GOT IT! I GOT THE BALLOON!

07:35.486 --> 07:37.658
(people groaning)

07:37.658 --> 07:42.132
JULES COBB REAL ESTATE
FOR ALL YOUR HOUSING NEEDS!

07:42.132 --> 07:43.534
HEY.

07:43.534 --> 07:45.065
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.668
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST EASIER

07:47.668 --> 07:49.870
TO DO WHAT BOBBY SAYS
AND NOT ASK QUESTIONS.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.042
(pop)
AAH!

07:52.042 --> 07:53.544
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:53.544 --> 07:56.707
I'M SENDING ELLIE PICTURES
OF FAMOUS WORKING MOMS.

07:56.707 --> 07:58.008
LAURIE, THAT'S TOO MEAN.

07:58.008 --> 08:01.612
I WAS GONNA INCLUDE YOU.
WELL, HOLD ON A SECOND.

08:01.612 --> 08:04.214
OKAY.

08:04.214 --> 08:06.687
(camera phone shutter clicks)

08:09.019 --> 08:11.922
MARINA, IF YOU'RE PART

08:11.922 --> 08:14.725
OF SOME WHITE BABY-SELLING RING,
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

08:14.725 --> 08:17.728
STAN'S CUBAN, SO HE WILL NOT
FETCH A GOOD PRICE.

08:17.728 --> 08:21.131
IT MUST BE HARD FOR YOU
TO LEAVE THIS MUГ‘EQUITO.

08:21.131 --> 08:22.703
IT IS.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.935
BUT NO SPANISH.
(Stan cooing)

08:24.935 --> 08:27.708
SO WHAT TIME WILL YOU
BE HOME FROM WORK?

08:30.080 --> 08:32.112
6:00.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.845
OH, I SHOULD HAVE SAID 5:00.

08:34.845 --> 08:36.516
WHAT'S WITH THE OUTFIT?

08:36.516 --> 08:39.089
I WORK HERE NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

08:39.089 --> 08:42.953
(chuckles) OKAY.
WHAT'S IN YOUR BRIEFCASE?
ALMONDS AND WINE.

08:42.953 --> 08:45.726
NO WAY! THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT'S IN MY BRIEFCASE.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.997
OH.

08:46.997 --> 08:50.130
SHALL WE?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.032
INDEED.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.163
MILADY.

08:53.163 --> 08:55.535
BUT I JUST SET UP MY OFFICE.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.537
WHERE AM I GONNA GO?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.812
MA'AM.

09:01.812 --> 09:03.543
YOU CANNOT DRINK HERE.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.817
YOU'RE KIDDING. HOW DO PEOPLE
GET THROUGH THE WORKDAY?

09:06.817 --> 09:08.679
(gasps)

09:08.679 --> 09:11.722
SHH. IT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S MY BABY.

09:11.722 --> 09:14.184
(gasps) AND MY HUSBAND.

09:14.184 --> 09:17.127
(whispers) HERE.
CAN YOU HOLD THIS FOR A SECOND?
(mouths word)

09:17.127 --> 09:19.129
OH! THERE IT IS.
BE COOL, MAN.

09:19.129 --> 09:22.132
IF WE ALL STARE AT THE SKY,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA KNOW.

09:22.132 --> 09:25.866
WE'LL LOOK UP IN SHIFTS.
FIRST ME. TRAVIS. NOW ANDY.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.639
NOW ME. TRAVIS. ANDY.

09:28.639 --> 09:29.970
(thud)

09:29.970 --> 09:32.142
NOW ME. OOH!
OOH!

09:32.142 --> 09:34.144
GO ON WITHOUT ME.

09:34.144 --> 09:36.006
YOU HEARD HIM. ME.

09:36.006 --> 09:38.949
YOU. ME. YOU.

09:38.949 --> 09:42.653
THIS LOOKS TOTALLY NATURAL.
ME. YOU.

09:44.154 --> 09:45.956
OKAY. OH, MY GOD.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.719
I FEEL LIKE WE ARE
SO IN SYNC LATELY.

09:48.719 --> 09:52.022
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY AS YOU SAY IT.

09:52.022 --> 09:54.024
NO, YOU DON'T.
NO, YOU DON'T.

09:54.024 --> 09:56.897
OKAY, WELL, WAS A LITTLE LATE,
BUT I WASN'T READY YET.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.299
SAY ANYTHING, AND I'M GONNA SAY
IT WITH YOU IN EXACT UNISON.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.831
OKAY.
OKAY.

10:00.831 --> 10:02.833
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY...
LONG DAY.

10:02.833 --> 10:04.975
MOSTLY BECAUSE
THE PRESSURIZATION...
(speaks gibberish)

10:04.975 --> 10:06.977
ON THE BEER TAPS WAS BROKEN.
TAPS.

10:06.977 --> 10:08.979
I TRIED TO FIX IT MYSELF...
MYSELF.

10:08.979 --> 10:11.041
BUT THAT'S WHY I HAD
TO MOP THE WHOLE PLACE UP.
(murmurs) FLOORS. WHAT?

10:11.041 --> 10:14.014
YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT THIS.
I AM. I'M JUST OFF MY GAME.
I AM. I'M JUST OFF MY GAME.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.047
(gasps)
(gasps)
SEE, I'M GOOD AT THIS.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.218
(chuckles)

10:18.218 --> 10:20.320
YOU KNOW, I-IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE PUTTING OUT

10:20.320 --> 10:23.894
A REAL, UH,
RELATIONSHIP-Y VIBE.

10:23.894 --> 10:26.196
ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN HANDLE THIS?

10:26.196 --> 10:29.159
BECAUSE IT'S STILL EARLY ENOUGH
FOR US TO JUST BAIL.

10:29.159 --> 10:31.131
IF WE AVOID EACH OTHER
FOR A WEEK,

10:31.131 --> 10:34.134
I CAN TOTALLY FORGET
I'VE SEEN YOU NAKED.
REALLY? YOU COULD FORGET
IN A WEEK?

10:34.134 --> 10:37.307
I'D NEVER FORGET, WOULD I?
NICE SAVE.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.041
SINCE JULES DIDN'T ANSWER
AT HER HOUSE,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.043
I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WAS
OVER HERE WITH ELLIE.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.215
NO. MRS. TORRES IS AT WORK.

10:45.215 --> 10:47.317
SHE TOLD YOU
SHE WENT TO WORK?

10:47.317 --> 10:50.821
OHH!
THAT IS AWESOME NEWS, NANNY.

10:50.821 --> 10:52.883
SEE?
I'M NOT ALWAYS AN OTTER.

10:52.883 --> 10:55.125
SOMETIMES I JUST
LIKE TO HOLD HANDS.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.656
MM-HMM.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.358
MM.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.791
GRAYSON WAS RIGHT
TO BE WORRIED.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.433
YOU--YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS
WITHOUT GETTING ATTACHED.

11:03.433 --> 11:05.235
YES, I CAN.

11:05.235 --> 11:07.798
WILL YOU STROKE MY HAIR?

11:07.798 --> 11:10.240
I HAVE TO GO. THANK GOD.
WAIT. WHAT? WHY?

11:10.240 --> 11:13.243
WELL, BECAUSE--IT'S NOT YOU.
MY WORKDAY IS OVER. I...
BUT...

11:13.243 --> 11:16.206
(strained voice) YOU ARE
SQUEEZING ME VERY TIGHT.

11:16.206 --> 11:19.409
(sighs) WHAT A DAY, MARINA.

11:19.409 --> 11:21.411
BE GLAD YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER.

11:21.411 --> 11:24.414
DO YOU KNOW THAT COMPANIES
THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY

11:24.414 --> 11:27.157
WITH DUMPING CHEMICALS
IN OUR WATER SUPPLY?

11:27.157 --> 11:29.159
LUCKILY,
I CAN GET ANYONE TO TALK.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.161
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
FLASH A SMILE

11:31.161 --> 11:35.125
AND PUT ON A PUSH-UP BRA.
ARE YOU STEALING THE PLOT
OF "ERIN BROCKOVICH"?

11:35.125 --> 11:38.328
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR YOU,

11:38.328 --> 11:42.072
BUT NOW I'M LITERALLY
BATHING IN THIS MOMENT. (gasps)

11:42.072 --> 11:43.373
OH, GOSH.

11:43.373 --> 11:46.136
IT FEELS SO GOOD ON MY SKIN.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.411
AH,
NOTHING WE CAN DO TONIGHT.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.413
WE'LL BED DOWN HERE,
THEN AT FIRST LIGHT,

11:53.413 --> 11:55.485
WE GRAB HARD HATS,
A COUPLE OF MUSTACHES,

11:55.485 --> 11:59.019
WE'LL SHIMMY ON UP THERE
AND GRAB IT.
AND WHY THE MUSTACHES?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.022
WELL, YOU EVER SEEN A HARD HAT
WITHOUT A MUSTACHE UNDER IT?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.825
UH, NO, BUT IN MY DEFENSE,
I'M A SANE PERSON.

12:04.825 --> 12:08.398
GOTTA JAM. GOING OUT DANCING
WITH THE WIFE TONIGHT.
HEY. GO, ANDY.

12:08.398 --> 12:11.731
WE CAN'T GO DANCING.
I SENT THE NANNY HOME.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.363
I DON'T WANT HER.

12:13.363 --> 12:17.808
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
GO SHAKE IT BY MYSELF?
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.139
THAT WASN'T EVEN SUBTLE!

12:19.139 --> 12:22.212
TH-THERE'S AN ART TO THIS!

12:22.212 --> 12:23.743
(strumming chords)

12:23.743 --> 12:26.216
в™Є NO STRINGS ATTACHED,
NO NEED TO COMMIT в™Є

12:26.216 --> 12:28.448
в™Є WE'RE PALLIN' 'ROUND
WHILE WE'RE GETTIN' DOWN в™Є

12:28.448 --> 12:31.021
в™Є WE'RE FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS в™Є
в™Є FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS в™Є

12:31.021 --> 12:33.283
в™Є FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS в™Є

12:33.283 --> 12:34.885
HORRIBLE.

12:34.885 --> 12:37.828
WELL, YOU'LL BE
SINGING IT LATER.

12:37.828 --> 12:40.530
I HOPE NOT, BECAUSE IT'LL MEAN
SOMEONE HAS A GUN TO MY HEAD.
HEY, YOU WANT TO STAY
FOR COFFEE?

12:40.530 --> 12:44.264
EH, NOT TODAY.
OH, COOL.
SEE YOU ON THE FLIP SIDE.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.997
WHAT? PEOPLE STILL SAY
"FLIP SIDE."
(door opens and closes)

12:46.997 --> 12:49.099
SO HOW WAS THE BOOM-BOOM
LAST NIGHT?

12:49.099 --> 12:51.771
(scoffs) THAT IS SO MUCH WORSE
THAN "FLIP SIDE."

12:51.771 --> 12:54.905
I KNEW IT WHEN I SAID IT.
NO, WE ACTUALLY
DIDN'T EVEN HOOK UP.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.908
WE PLAYED PENNY CAN.
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

12:57.908 --> 13:00.050
OH, WE CAME UP
WITH THIS NEW TICKLE RULE.

13:00.050 --> 13:03.083
DID YOU?!
JULES, YOU ARE SO INTO HIM.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.285
ELLIE, I'VE GOT THIS
UNDER CONTROL.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.087
MM-HMM.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.390
LOOK AT HIM.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.893
LOOK AT HIM, JULES.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.225
I DON'T WANT TO.
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.928
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
GRAYSON'S RIGHT OVER THERE...

13:17.928 --> 13:19.229
SAY IT, JULES.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.074
(voice breaks) IT'S LIKE
HE'S A MILLION MILES AWAY.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.877
(front door opens and closes)
MM-HMM.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.117
IS HE LOOKING AT ME?
WHAT ABOUT NOW? WHAT ABOUT NOW?
NO. NO. YEAH.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.419
REALLY?
NO.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.122
I JUST FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.
NO, BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T BE NORMAL.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.994
YES, I CAN.
HEY!

13:43.994 --> 13:46.826
YOU WORK THAT HOSE, BITCH!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.299
YOU'RE WEIRD, JULES.

13:49.299 --> 13:51.301
(chuckles)
WEIRD LIKE A FOX.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.303
OH, NO. PUT THE GUNS AWAY.

13:53.303 --> 13:55.135
DAMN THESE THINGS.
I HATE THEM!

14:01.141 --> 14:03.914
(whispering)
TRAV, CHECK IT OUT.

14:03.914 --> 14:07.147
(whispering) WHY ARE
WE WHISPERING?
BECAUSE THE BALLOON'S
RIGHT THERE.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.520
WE DON'T WANT TO SPOOK IT.
(normal voice) IT'S A BALLOON.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.154
(normal voice) NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU DID. COME ON!

14:15.525 --> 14:17.928
JUST TELL HIM
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

14:17.928 --> 14:21.191
BEING OPEN AND HONEST IS
A FIRM PLAN "C."

14:21.191 --> 14:23.393
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THE OTHER PLANS.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.395
PLAN "A" WOULD JUST BE

14:25.395 --> 14:27.537
CONTINUING ON WITH OUR FRIENDS
WITH BENEFITS THING FOREVER.

14:27.537 --> 14:30.300
PLAN "B" IS
A LITTLE MORE INTRICATE.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.572
FIRST, I HAVE TO MAKE HIM
FEEL INSECURE

14:32.572 --> 14:34.574
WITH A SERIES
OF INSULT-COMPLIMENTS,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.978
LIKE, UM, "I JUST LOVE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL, TINY EYES"

14:37.978 --> 14:39.980
OR, UM,
"YOUR RECEDING HAIRLINE

14:39.980 --> 14:43.053
REALLY MAKES
YOUR TINY EYES POP."

14:43.053 --> 14:45.485
SO YOU'RE GONNA FOCUS
ON THE EYES?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.187
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.319
AND THEN TO STRIP WHAT'S LEFT
OF HIS SELF-ESTEEM,

14:49.319 --> 14:50.991
I'LL FATTEN HIM UP.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.663
NOW ONCE HE'S GAINED ABOUT
400 POUNDS AND HATES HIMSELF,

14:53.663 --> 14:55.996
THAT'S WHEN I CUT HIM LOOSE.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.169
THAT FAT BASTARD WILL BEG
TO HAVE ME BACK.

14:59.169 --> 15:01.271
EITHER I'LL WANT HIM
OR I WON'T,

15:01.271 --> 15:03.433
BUT THE POINT IS,
IT'LL BE MY CHOICE.

15:03.433 --> 15:07.107
WELL, I MEAN, I-I-IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.238
LOTS.

15:08.238 --> 15:11.481
NOT CRAZY AT ALL.
GOD, NO.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.984
HEY, ANDY.

15:13.984 --> 15:15.585
YOUR NOSTRILS LOOK
REALLY MAD.

15:15.585 --> 15:18.448
STOP TORTURING ELLIE
ABOUT THE NANNY.

15:18.448 --> 15:21.421
LOOK, THE BEST THING TO DO
WHEN SOMEONE PICKS ON YOU IS

15:21.421 --> 15:23.423
TO GIVE THEM A TASTE
OF THEIR OWN MEDICINE.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.426
I READ THAT IN A MAGAZINE. AND I
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.428
BUT I REALLY DID READ IT
IN A MAGAZINE.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.331
I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER'S LIFE.
WHAT MAGAZINE?

15:31.331 --> 15:34.334
WHAT KIND OF A FRIEND
WOULDN'T LET THAT SLIDE?

15:34.334 --> 15:37.237
NOW MY MOM IS GONNA DIE,
YOU MURDERER.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.239
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

15:39.239 --> 15:41.241
FOR A MAN
TO FIND A GIFT FOR HIS WIFE

15:41.241 --> 15:44.274
THAT SHE THINKS IS FOR HER
BUT IS ACTUALLY FOR HIM?

15:44.274 --> 15:46.316
LINGERIE DIDN'T WORK.
SHE SAW RIGHT THROUGH THAT.

15:46.316 --> 15:49.319
ORAL SEX CLASS?
HA HA. HUGE MISTAKE,

15:49.319 --> 15:51.651
AND AS IT TURNS OUT,
REALLY INSULTING.

15:51.651 --> 15:55.225
BUT THE NANNY? ELLIE SEES
THAT AS TOTALLY SELFLESS,

15:55.225 --> 15:58.228
BUT TO ME IT MEANS BEING ABLE
TO GO OUT TO A DINNER OR A MOVIE

15:58.228 --> 16:00.230
OR EVEN DANCING
ONCE IN A WHILE.

16:00.230 --> 16:02.462
DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE LAST TIME
I WENT DANCING WAS, LAURIE?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.334
HUH? DO YA?
NO!

16:04.334 --> 16:05.635
THIS...

16:05.635 --> 16:08.238
WAS STILL FRESH.

16:11.201 --> 16:13.273
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
KEEP DOING THAT?

16:19.509 --> 16:22.082
(horn honking)
COME BACK!

16:22.082 --> 16:24.214
DAD, IT WON'T LISTEN!
IT'S JUST A BALLOON!

16:24.214 --> 16:27.317
(horns honk, tires screech)

16:27.317 --> 16:29.689
I'M GONNA GET YOU, BABY!
I'M GONNA GET YOU!

16:29.689 --> 16:31.721
AAH!

16:31.721 --> 16:33.663
DAD!

16:33.663 --> 16:36.596
DAD?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.198
OH, THANK GOD.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.200
(laughs)

16:40.200 --> 16:43.373
WAIT. DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS
ANOTHER LEDGE HERE?

16:43.373 --> 16:46.376
NO. I MAY HAVE GOT A LITTLE
CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT.

16:46.376 --> 16:47.377
(grunts)

16:47.377 --> 16:49.509
YOU ALMOST DIED!
AND FOR WHAT?

16:49.509 --> 16:53.183
TO GET YOUR DUMB BOAT
BACK IN THE WATER?

16:53.183 --> 16:57.117
LOOK, NO MORE DRIVING
SENIOR CITIZENS AROUND FOR CASH,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.748
NO MORE SLEEPING ON BENCHES.

16:58.748 --> 17:01.020
JUST NO MORE, OKAY?

17:03.593 --> 17:06.156
(scoffs) GROW UP, DAD.

17:06.156 --> 17:09.359
COME ON. HOW COULD
YOU NOT LAUGH AT THAT?

17:09.359 --> 17:12.162
HEY, STUDLY.
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

17:12.162 --> 17:14.164
YOU KNOW I-I WAS
JUST THINKING ABOUT

17:14.164 --> 17:16.336
HOW WE GET TO KEEP KNOCKING IT
OUT AND HIGH-FIVING AFTERWARDS

17:16.336 --> 17:18.208
UNTIL WE DIE.

17:18.208 --> 17:19.669
I'M SO PSYCHED.

17:19.669 --> 17:22.512
YOU JUST SAY, "SHALL WE?"

17:22.512 --> 17:25.275
NO PROBLEM. SHALL WE?

17:25.275 --> 17:26.816
в™Єв™Є

17:26.816 --> 17:28.818
GRAYSON, I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:28.818 --> 17:31.421
NO, THAT'S, UM,
THAT'S WHERE YOU SAY "INDEED."

17:31.421 --> 17:33.723
I JUST--I WANT MORE. I DO.

17:33.723 --> 17:36.726
I KNOW WHAT I SAID BEFORE,
BUT THAT WAS, LIKE,

17:36.726 --> 17:39.229
18 HOURS AGO,
AND THAT WAS THE OLD JULES.

17:39.229 --> 17:42.132
THE NEW JULES--
SHE SHOOTS FROM THE HIP.

17:42.132 --> 17:43.793
GO AWAY.

17:43.793 --> 17:47.767
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
THAT YOU AND I DIDN'T DIVE IN

17:47.767 --> 17:49.599
IS BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.302
I'VE BEEN MAKING
SO MANY DECISIONS MY WHOLE LIFE

17:52.302 --> 17:53.603
OUT OF FEAR.

17:53.603 --> 17:55.775
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO IT ANYMORE.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.309
COME ON. WE LIKE EACH OTHER.

17:59.309 --> 18:02.382
LET'S DO THIS.
LET'S DO THIS.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.854
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

18:04.854 --> 18:07.817
JUST SAY...

18:07.817 --> 18:09.759
"WHY NOT?"

18:09.759 --> 18:11.791
(Goldhawks) в™Є EACH NIGHT
WE'D FALL IN LOVE в™Є

18:11.791 --> 18:14.364
SO HOW'D IT GO?

18:14.364 --> 18:16.366
TOO SOON?

18:16.366 --> 18:18.468
JUST GIVE HIM SOME TIME.

18:18.468 --> 18:22.402
HE PROBABLY JUST THINKS THIS
ISN'T WHAT HE SIGNED UP FOR.
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.604
I DON'T GET IT.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.337
NO, THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHAT HE SAID.
OOH.

18:27.337 --> 18:31.341
в™Є ..TO HOLD TO GET ME THROUGH
THE STAGE OF LIFE в™Є

18:31.341 --> 18:33.883
WELL, THAT'S TWICE
I'VE FOUND YOU IN HERE.

18:33.883 --> 18:36.216
I'M BUYING BEAR SPRAY.

18:36.216 --> 18:40.350
I WAS JUST TEASING
ABOUT THE NANNY, YOU WUSS.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.392
LOOK...

18:42.392 --> 18:45.555
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,

18:45.555 --> 18:47.557
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL JULES.

18:47.557 --> 18:49.259
I'M INTRIGUED.

18:49.259 --> 18:51.761
YOU'RE KIND OF MY HERO.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.263
NO, THANK YOU.

18:53.263 --> 18:55.205
OKAY, NOT YOU PERSONALLY,

18:55.205 --> 18:58.338
BUT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING--

18:58.338 --> 19:00.870
A GREAT HOUSE, GREAT FAMILY,

19:00.870 --> 19:03.313
FANCY OLD LADY CLOTHES.

19:03.313 --> 19:05.645
THE DIRTY SECRET IS,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.248
I WANT YOUR LIFE, NOT JULES'.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.250
SHE WORKS LIKE A DOG.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.422
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IF I DO MARRY SMITH,

19:12.422 --> 19:14.924
JULES IS GONNA WALK
