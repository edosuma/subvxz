00:22.564 --> 00:23.648
KATSUMOTO:
Stay behind me.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.774
OFFICER:
I'll check the perimeter.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.317
KATSUMOTO:
Go around back.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.653
Go! Go! Go!

00:29.863 --> 00:31.906
Spread out. Keep your distance.
Yes, sir.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.991
Watch it, watch it.

00:54.971 --> 00:55.889
Go.

00:55.972 --> 00:58.767
OFFICER:
Sir.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.812
We checked the immediate area.
It's all clear.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.063
(shackles clanking)

01:04.147 --> 01:06.858
All right, listen up.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.860
As of this moment, any officer
who was off duty is now on.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.488
We have an escaped prisoner
on the run.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.240
Name's Mason Watts,
and he's not just any prisoner.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.701
He's a mass murderer who was
declared criminally insane.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.912
We need to hunt him down
and we need to do it fast.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.331
We're less than three miles
from a residential area.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.625
Set up checkpoints on all
major streets in the vicinity.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.668
I want birds in the air
and canines on the ground.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.296
It's Halloween.
Kids are on the streets.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.756
And we have a real-life monster
on the loose.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.008
Let's go get him.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.861

01:56.616 --> 01:58.952

01:59.035 --> 02:00.870
That bag better be filled
with Kit Kats and Snickers.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.706
And jumbo-sized.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.709
Mr. Masters can't be giving out
tiny candy bars.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.086
I actually won't be helping
candy companies use a holiday

02:09.169 --> 02:11.047
to peddle processed sugar
to minors. No.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.091
Uh, Magnum and I
actually booked a case.

02:13.174 --> 02:16.010
On Halloween?
Blame Magnum.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.221
He seems to think P.I. stands
for paranormal investigator.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.056
Okay.
What did he get you into?

02:20.139 --> 02:22.517
Oh, we just have
to spend the night

02:22.600 --> 02:24.227
at our client's haunted house.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.020
Oh, a haunted house
on Halloween?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.897
Spooky.
Correction.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.275
It's not actually haunted,
it's just a house

02:30.358 --> 02:32.527
that our client thinks
is haunted.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.195
It's, uh,
an old place on Koio Place.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.530
I'm sure the "ghosts"
are nothing more

02:35.613 --> 02:39.868
than leaky pipes, but...

02:39.951 --> 02:42.161
Wait, not 5250 Koio Place?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.913
Yes. It is.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.665
How on earth
could you know that?

02:45.748 --> 02:46.916
The Slaughterhouse is
the most famous haunted house

02:47.000 --> 02:49.419
on the island.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
The Slaughterhouse?
Well,

02:51.004 --> 02:54.299
that's what the locals
have called it ever since

02:54.382 --> 02:56.593
the legendary Killer of Waianae
brutally murdered

02:56.676 --> 02:58.553
a family there 20 years ago.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.431
That's awful.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.974
The Slaughterhouse is filled
with tortured souls.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.601
Maybe you shouldn't take
the case.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.935
Thank you for your concern,
Kumu.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.104
I'm sure we'll be fine.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.273
There is no such thing
as a haunted house.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.609
(phone ringing)

03:13.860 --> 03:15.570
Hold that thought.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.322
Hello?

03:17.405 --> 03:18.448
Yes.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.951
They what?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.828
Tell them not to touch anything.
I'll be right there.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.413
Is everything okay?
(sighs)

03:25.496 --> 03:28.249
Cultural Center emergency.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.251
A real estate developer might
have uncovered a heiau.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.003
I need to go and verify
if it's real.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.129
Wish me luck.
Bye.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.631
Magnum. Jin.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.798
Hi and bye, Kumu.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.508
Come and gone.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.218
Just like all the
women in my life.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.887
What is his deal?

03:42.221 --> 03:44.307
His model girlfriend dumped him.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.101
Keo didn't dump me,
it was mutual.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.646
We mutually decided it would be
best if we mutually broke up.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.105
Anybody who says "mutual"
that many times got dumped.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.523
HIGGINS: So, you
brought Jin here

03:52.607 --> 03:54.525
to sulk?

03:54.609 --> 03:55.818
Actually, there's been
a slight change of plans.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.487
Tell her what you told me.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.365
Okay. A couple of days ago,

04:00.448 --> 04:03.034
after my model girlfriend
and I mutually broke up,

04:03.117 --> 04:04.786
I posted bail
for my friend Ika.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.622
Unfortunately, he skipped.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.998
And, if he's not caught,
I'm out 15K.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.669
Jin wants us to help
track him down.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.003
Okay. What's Ika's surname?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.463
Kalima.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.839
Right.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.800
And you really have no idea
where he could be?

04:18.882 --> 04:20.051
He literally could be anywhere.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.719
Okay. According to
his social media,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.846
his sister is the last person
who posted

04:23.930 --> 04:25.682
on his Facebook page,
inviting him

04:25.765 --> 04:28.267
to a Halloween party
this evening.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.395
You know, he might actually go
to the party.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.396
Wait. How do you figure?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.856
Skips always go back to family,

04:33.940 --> 04:36.025
and a Halloween party would be
a perfect cover

04:36.109 --> 04:37.694
for somebody trying to visit
their family on the DL.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.238
HIGGINS:
Big crowds,

04:40.321 --> 04:42.532
costumes-- he could slip in
undetected.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.242
Okay, look, I know it's my fault

04:44.325 --> 04:46.077
for hanging out
with a guy like Ika,

04:46.160 --> 04:48.496
and in a way I deserve it,

04:49.914 --> 04:51.749
but I took a big risk
to help out a friend.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.881
I could really use your help
on this one.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.883
Well, we're on a case,
but... there are two of us,

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
and Rick and TC
are in the bullpen.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.053
Fine, well, how do we decide
who goes with Jin

05:04.137 --> 05:06.222
and who goes
to the haunted house?

05:06.305 --> 05:08.099
Flip for it.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.101
Wait. You're flipping--
you're gonna take the case?
Yes,

05:11.644 --> 05:12.603
we're gonna take
the case, relax.
Tails.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.688
Tails.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.315
JIN: Yes, tails.
Higgins for the win.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.400
I'm gonna get the costumes.
It's gonna be great.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.110
Oh, Jin.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.695
I won the toss.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.780
Yeah. I know.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.906
It's you and me, buddy.

05:23.990 --> 05:24.824
Wait a second.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.784
It was either me

05:26.868 --> 05:28.411
or spending the night
in a haunted house

05:28.494 --> 05:30.121
and the loser gets me?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.041
Mm-hmm.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.049
Ouch.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.551
Lava rock.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.678

All right, listen up!

05:58.858 --> 06:01.110
You heard her!

06:01.194 --> 06:02.528
This is an ancient
Hawaiian altar.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.072
It's very sacred.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.824
So pack it up.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.451
I want this place locked down
and wrapped up in an hour.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.246
Let's go!

Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.368
Very funny, my friend.

Oh, come on. I-I--
You know, I'm offended

07:36.956 --> 07:38.749
that you would think that's
the only reason why I'd call.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.750
Well, isn't it?
No. I just called to see

07:39.834 --> 07:41.335
how my boys are doing.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.212
But now that you mention it,

07:43.296 --> 07:44.714
there is something I'd like
to talk to you about.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.883
No. No. Sorry.
Not gonna help.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.176
Yeah, brah, we have lives.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.928
And it's Halloween.

The favor's for me.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.058
Oh, whatever
you need, Higgy.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.560
Yeah, anything for you.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.895

So, I only

07:58.978 --> 08:00.605
need one of you,

08:00.688 --> 08:02.690
and you can decide
which of you it will be.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.567
There is an old
lady who believes

08:04.650 --> 08:05.735
that she is
living with ghosts.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.737
And I must

08:07.820 --> 08:09.488
spend the night in
a haunted house.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.448
Oh, oh, me, me, me.
I got it. Me.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.449
This is Rick.
I-I'll take it.

I will gracefully bow out

08:20.374 --> 08:23.127
from spending the night
in a spooky house

08:23.211 --> 08:24.921
out of the goodness
of my merry heart.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.336
Yeah, that's true.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.007
(laughs, whoops)

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
PONO:
I'm really bummed
I missed it, too.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.177
Tell him I pinky swear

09:55.261 --> 09:57.847
that I'll go through
all his candy with him.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.015
Okay? Got to go.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.725
I love you.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.601
(phone beeps)

10:02.685 --> 10:03.769
Sorry about that.
(clears throat)

10:03.853 --> 10:04.979
It's okay.

10:05.062 --> 10:05.980
Kid's trick-or-
treating already?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.565
Yeah.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.860
It's his first time.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.154
(chuckles)

10:14.989 --> 10:16.407
Get ready, Pono.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.658
I hate to say it, but this
is just the beginning

10:19.493 --> 10:21.704
of things you're gonna miss.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.874
Holidays, ball games...

10:24.957 --> 10:27.168
(sighs) graduations.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.712
Crime doesn't care
about your schedule.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.006
Your wife okay
with that?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.591
Ah, she says she is,

10:33.674 --> 10:35.718
but I think
she's starting to feel

10:37.636 --> 10:39.013
what that sacrifice
really means.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.598
You want my advice?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
Always.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.519
Make sure you let 'em know
you're not gone

10:45.603 --> 10:47.980
because you're too busy
for them.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.066
You're gone
because you love them.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.526
Copy?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.570
Copy that.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.113
DISPATCHER: All units,
Five-O requesting backup

10:56.197 --> 10:58.240
at 17 North Pualei.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
Suspect has been injured
but remains at large

11:00.034 --> 11:01.410
and is considered
highly dangerous.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.245
Use extreme caution.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.414
Uh, can you believe that?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
Two psychos loose
on the same night.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.584
There's just something
about Halloween.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.253
So what's the plan?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.089
We patrol the area
till somebody spots our guy?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.840
Either that or we figure out
where he might be headed.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.050
How? We don't have
a single lead.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.178
There's always a lead.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.930
What did CSU find
at the crash site?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.765
Gravitational blood drops.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.600
Which means?
Watts is injured.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.813
Exactly.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.106
He'll be looking
for a place to recover.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.440
(indistinct chatter)

11:31.524 --> 11:32.733
A place where he can blend in

11:35.069 --> 11:37.113
and get out
of his prison clothes.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.280
Somewhere he can lay low

11:38.364 --> 11:40.324
and figure out his next move.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.789

12:01.846 --> 12:04.598

I can't believe that you managed
to pack an overnight bag,

12:09.228 --> 12:10.354
yet you forgot
to change out of your costume?

12:10.438 --> 12:12.356
I didn't forget, okay?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.191
I worked very hard on this,

12:14.275 --> 12:15.818
and I deserve
to flaunt it.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.653
Do you even know who I am?

12:17.736 --> 12:18.779
Yeah, of course.
You're Gumby.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.322

Come on in.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.215
What a lovely home.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.885
HELEN: (chuckles)
I don't hear that often.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.553
People tell me
I should move away.

12:42.636 --> 12:46.015
But I have so many

12:46.098 --> 12:47.433
wonderful memories here
with my late husband.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.435
Oh, I'm so sorry to
hear of his passing.

12:49.518 --> 12:53.022
Oh, thank you.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.024
Well, it was very quiet
for a while after that.

12:55.107 --> 12:59.445
Yes, you said you were
hearing some noises.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.404
Yes. Two days ago is
when I first heard... it.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.406
"It"?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.366
Well,
it sounded like

13:04.450 --> 13:07.661
a young child, wailing.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.164
I know the history
of this house,

13:10.247 --> 13:11.707
and so I supposed that it was...

13:11.790 --> 13:13.667
HIGGINS:
Well, not to worry.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.461
We'll get to the bottom of it.
You can count on us.
Oh.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.545
Oh. Thank you so much.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.713
HIGGINS:
Course.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.298
Well, I'll see you

13:19.381 --> 13:21.342
in the morning, okay?
Yes.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.551
Bye-bye.
Good night.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.886
Bye-bye.
Bye.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.554
Wow.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.558
(door closes)
Wow.

13:29.642 --> 13:33.562
I always wanted to be
in a real haunted house.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
(exhales)
Okay, you know this house
isn't actually haunted, right?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.398
Well, who's to say
it is or it isn't?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.733
Me.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.068
And it isn't.
Okay.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.278
Well, agree to disagree.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.405
It's been my dream, always,

13:43.489 --> 13:45.032
to spend one night in
a real haunted house.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.582
This is gonna be so much fun.

14:01.799 --> 14:06.262
(leaves rustling)

14:06.345 --> 14:07.721
Get it together, wahine,
or it's gonna be a long night.

Who's there?!

14:14.353 --> 14:15.604
Kumu, it's just me.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.773
It's TC!

14:17.856 --> 14:19.942
Why you sneaking up on me
like that?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.777
(chuckles): I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.113
Well, maybe I did at first,
but then I saw

14:24.196 --> 14:26.615
how freaked out you got
and I had a change of heart.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.284
You had a change of heart,
while I need a change of pants.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.660
(chuckles)
What are you
doing here?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.454
Well, Thomas and Higgy

14:32.538 --> 14:34.456
told me you were gonna watch the
heiau until the kahu shows up,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.917
so I figured I'd bring
some bare essentials

14:37.001 --> 14:38.752
to hold us down
while we keep watch.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.629
"We"?
(scoffs)

14:40.713 --> 14:43.299
What kind of Robin Hood
would I be

14:43.382 --> 14:44.758
if I let my sister
stay out here by herself?

14:44.842 --> 14:46.594
TC, that means a lot,

14:46.677 --> 14:49.638
but you don't have to...
Okay.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.974
Once you see what I got,
you're gonna want me to stay.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.768
Bare essentials, huh?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.812
Well, shall I take
my wine and be gone?

17:42.394 --> 17:43.312
I was helping Magnum out
with something very legal.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.147
Helping out with what?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.356
And why make a point
to tell me it's legal?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.941
That's true. Yeah.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.818
I'm working a case.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.029
Anyway, what's
going on out here?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.655
Nothing.
It's a holiday.

That's your big case?

18:14.259 --> 18:15.385
Hold on.
Why do I know that name?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.179
He's the Waianae Killer.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.348

18:32.945 --> 18:35.364
Okay.

(laughter)
Yeah, me, too!

Mmm.
(chuckling)

19:59.364 --> 20:01.450
I'm telling you,

20:01.533 --> 20:03.911
once you go
hurricane popcorn,

20:03.994 --> 20:06.663
you can't go back
to regular popcorn.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.791
I mean, I can't even imagine one
without the other.
Mm.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.418
It's like... cereal and milk.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.711
Or Magnum and Higgins.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.882
(chuckles)

20:16.965 --> 20:18.800
Hey, if I hadn't showed up,

20:18.884 --> 20:20.969
you wouldn't be scared
out here by yourself?

20:21.053 --> 20:21.970
Only if some lolo came barging
out of the woods.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.806
(chuckles)

20:24.890 --> 20:27.351
Look, I'm sorry
about that, again.

20:27.434 --> 20:31.480
It's just...

20:31.563 --> 20:34.983
being out here
with this sacred heiau,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.652
you wouldn't be scared to be
out here with all these spirits?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.320
You don't believe in spirits?

20:38.403 --> 20:41.657
I didn't say that.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.660
I have a healthy respect
for my ancestors.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.663
But I know you really believe
in that stuff.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.415
So you wouldn't
be scared to...

20:52.042 --> 20:54.628
think you were
constantly being watched?

20:54.711 --> 20:58.840
(exhales)

20:58.924 --> 21:01.843
My husband had the loudest voice
you ever heard.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.136
His friends called him
the human megaphone.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.223
(chuckles softly)

21:06.306 --> 21:08.141
His laugh lit up
whatever room he was in.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.477
Sometimes,

21:10.560 --> 21:13.188
when I'm alone in nature

21:13.271 --> 21:16.858
and it's dead quiet,

21:20.821 --> 21:24.866
I can still hear him laughing.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.497
Do I think it's scary to
be surrounded by spirits?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.001
It's much scarier to
think that we're not.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.547
(quietly):
Yeah.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.924
MAGNUM:
These pics of Ika are useless.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.010
Half the people in here
are wearing masks.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.762
Hey. How tall did
you say he was?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.723
I don't know, Magnum.
I didn't ask him that question.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.975
So he's a close friend of yours,

21:50.058 --> 21:52.352
and you have no idea
how tall he is?

21:52.436 --> 21:54.479
I judge a man by his heart,
Magnum, not his height.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.605
Knock it off, all right?
This is your $15,000

21:55.689 --> 21:57.399
we're trying to get back.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.734
Hey, it's 50 grand.
Nah, I'm pretty sure

21:58.817 --> 22:00.235
you said it was 15.

22:00.318 --> 22:02.112
I'm pretty sure it was 50 grand

22:02.195 --> 22:04.072
since I'm the one
that's missing 50 grand.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.949
Okay, this is suspicious.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.576
Why are you throwing around
that kind of cash?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.703
And how do you even know Ika?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.080
We're best friends.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.043
Okay, we're friends.

22:16.126 --> 22:16.877
We're, like, best new...
acquaintances, okay?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.920
Which means?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.964
Which means that
I've met him twice,

22:21.048 --> 22:22.424
and they were
very meaningful encounters.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.301
I'd call them
"seated encounters,"

22:24.384 --> 22:26.428
so I don't know exactly
how tall he is,

22:26.511 --> 22:27.929
but he's got really good
body posture when he's sitting,

22:28.013 --> 22:29.264
if that's what you want to know.

22:29.347 --> 22:32.059
I can't do this anymore.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.227
Okay, I paid for his bail
with stolen money,

22:34.311 --> 22:35.937
all right,
so I could get money in return

22:36.021 --> 22:37.981
in the form
of a government check.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.941
Jin, that is money laundering.
Well,

22:40.025 --> 22:43.320
I call it a "financial cleanse."

22:43.403 --> 22:45.155
Listen, it would have gone over
smoothly if he didn't jump bail.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.532
All right?
We didn't hurt anybody.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.451
Why are you
so bent out of shape over it?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.286
You know, I wanted
to believe you when you said

22:51.369 --> 22:53.830
you were making better choices,
and that's on me.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.957
But you made me bail on a
real client, and that's on you.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.584
Good night, Jin.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.755
I'm sorry.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.135
(panting, groaning)

23:07.219 --> 23:08.804
Jin!
(screaming)

23:08.887 --> 23:10.514
What? Excuse me.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.142
Excuse me!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.977
Go find Katsumoto!

23:16.061 --> 23:17.479
Go!
Okay. Okay. Okay!

23:17.562 --> 23:19.147
You're gonna be okay, all right?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.988
Just try not to move your neck
too much.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.949
It's Pono, right?

23:29.032 --> 23:30.492
Take the knife out.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.077
No, no, no. It's gonna have
to stay in for now.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.495
That's the only thing
stopping you from bleeding out.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.372
We're gonna get you
some help, okay?

23:36.581 --> 23:38.083
EMS is on the way.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.334
Just take it easy.
Sir...

23:39.417 --> 23:40.210
Save your energy.
No.

23:40.293 --> 23:41.419
It's Watts.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.671
He ditched
his jumpsuit

23:42.754 --> 23:44.673
for civilian clothes.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.341
Blue jeans, green flannel.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.384
Need all units at 1275 Nuku.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.511
Watts spotted.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.595
He's in blue jeans
and a green flannel.
I repeat:

23:50.679 --> 23:53.890
blue jeans and a green flannel.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.058
Katsumoto, I know you got
your guys on it, but...

23:55.142 --> 23:56.560
Go get the bastard.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.353
Come on.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.271
(grunts weakly)

23:59.354 --> 24:00.397
Hey, look at me.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.565
Look at me.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.983
You did great.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.152
All right?
Just take it easy.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.361
I'll be fine. Go get him.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.405
Oh, we'll get him.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.157
I'm staying right here with you.

24:10.240 --> 24:13.952
You just hang on.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.996
All right, now we can either
sleep 180 back-to-back,

24:16.079 --> 24:18.248
or we can take
alternating naps.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.041
Rick, you're not in a bunker
in Afghanistan

24:20.125 --> 24:22.377
with TC and Magnum, all right?

24:22.460 --> 24:25.255
We're in an old lady's
house in Hawaii.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.884
(ghostly wailing in distance)

24:28.967 --> 24:31.887
No, that can't be.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.222
(ghostly wailing continues)

24:34.306 --> 24:35.557
Yep. Okay. I heard that.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.683
Let's check it out,
shall we?

24:36.766 --> 24:40.312
It's probably
just the plumbing.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.522
Yeah, his plumbing sounds
just like a screaming child.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.610
Totally normal.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.367
(ghostly wailing echoing)

24:56.203 --> 24:58.413
(floor creaks)

25:05.545 --> 25:07.464
(ghostly wailing continues)

25:11.509 --> 25:13.595
(stairs creaking)

25:13.678 --> 25:16.097
(ghostly wailing continues)

25:29.569 --> 25:31.279
(whispers): I think
it's coming from up here.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.948
(loud wailing)

25:33.031 --> 25:34.324
(exhales)

25:34.407 --> 25:37.285
Hear that?

25:43.541 --> 25:45.252
I think it's coming
from behind that door.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.128
After you.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.757
Me? Why me?

25:52.008 --> 25:53.969
Because this is your
haunted house fantasy.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.637
(sighs):
Good point.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.639
Well, it's just a...

25:57.722 --> 25:58.974
normal doorknob anyway, right?

25:59.057 --> 26:00.600
Right.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.270
Or is it?

26:03.353 --> 26:05.689
It's actually
quite an ornate little fellow.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.941
Is it brass or copper?
It's hard to tell.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.068
Depends on whether or not
it's been lacquered, but...

26:10.151 --> 26:12.112
oftentimes,
a strange patina will...

26:15.073 --> 26:16.658
Are you kidding me? Move.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.160
You see?

26:19.244 --> 26:21.329
That wasn't so hard,
now, was it?
Right.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.998
Now, sometimes you
can just reach in

26:23.081 --> 26:24.165
and find the
light in here.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.334
Aah! Aah!

26:26.418 --> 26:29.004
What was that?
Well, if I had to guess,

26:29.087 --> 26:31.006
I would say the corpse
of a young child.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.508
(sighs)
Rick.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.635
(mutters)

26:37.262 --> 26:39.347
"Corpse of a child."

26:39.431 --> 26:41.308
Whoa.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.027
(floor creaking)

26:52.110 --> 26:53.778
HIGGINS:
Well...

26:54.779 --> 26:55.864
isn't that...

26:55.947 --> 26:57.866
...charming?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.701
I was gonna say
the same thing.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.078
(loud wailing)

27:02.162 --> 27:03.788
That was not coming
from in here.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.166
Mm-mm.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.045
Okay, don't worry,
Higgy, you got this.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.047
So if wasn't for Scrappy,

27:12.130 --> 27:13.715
the gang wouldn't have known

27:13.798 --> 27:17.510
that it was the gardener

27:17.594 --> 27:19.596
pretending to be a ghost
the whole time.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.681
Like, he pulled
his mask off,

27:23.350 --> 27:27.103
and it was the gardener.

27:29.272 --> 27:32.567
There was never a ghost
in the first place.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.902
Honey, if you have to
explain it, it ain't scary.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.237
(sighs)

27:36.321 --> 27:38.281
Kumu, if you got
a better story, then...

27:38.365 --> 27:39.991
I do, actually.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.080
Then by all means.

27:45.163 --> 27:49.084
There once was a man
named Hanalei...

27:50.293 --> 27:53.380
who was cursed with a
taste for human flesh.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.756
He kept his cravings
at bay by hunting boar,

27:54.839 --> 27:57.092
but one day...

27:57.175 --> 28:00.053
a storm kept him
from hunting,

28:01.179 --> 28:03.390
and he was desperate
for something to eat.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.766
Then he spotted
a little girl.

28:04.849 --> 28:08.103
Oh.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.855
The villagers heard screams,
and when they arrived,

28:12.690 --> 28:16.361
Hanalei was gorging
on her flesh.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.950
He refused to settle
for boar again.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.452
And some say,
to this day...

28:24.536 --> 28:27.497
he roams the forest

28:30.500 --> 28:32.669
searching for his next meal.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.299
(branches snapping)
(gasping)

28:38.383 --> 28:40.760
(panting):
Please. Help.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.305
It's my little brother.
He's in danger. Please.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.473
We were riding our bikes
to go see the heiau,

28:45.557 --> 28:46.808
and he just fell over the side.

28:46.891 --> 28:49.060
Oh.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.480
(whimpering)

28:52.564 --> 28:54.816
What's his name?
Keala.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.484
Keala, don't look
down. Hold on.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.778
Please hurry.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.700
Kids, get away from the edge!
Get away from the edge.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.161
KEALA:
Help! Hurry!

29:06.244 --> 29:07.996
Grab on!

29:11.124 --> 29:12.167
(grunts)

29:14.252 --> 29:15.670
Be careful, TC.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.507
How about now?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.176
(straining)

29:21.259 --> 29:23.303
(yells)

29:23.386 --> 29:24.971
Those roots aren't gonna
hold much longer.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.182
Please do something!

29:27.265 --> 29:29.767
I have an idea. Hold on.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.855
KEALA:
Hurry!

29:33.938 --> 29:36.191
Anything?

29:36.274 --> 29:37.984
No, not yet.

29:40.653 --> 29:41.863
Maybe Watts went back...

29:41.946 --> 29:43.531
Ika.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.492
What is it?
You got Watts?

29:45.575 --> 29:48.077
Let me call you right back.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.542
No, ho-hold...
(line clicks)

30:02.175 --> 30:04.552
Excuse me.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.267
(metallic clanking)

30:12.810 --> 30:14.395
(whimpers)

30:14.479 --> 30:16.022
Blue jeans, green flannel.

30:16.105 --> 30:18.107
It's the Waianae Killer.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.162
(panting)

30:31.246 --> 30:33.623
(phone beeping)

30:33.706 --> 30:35.750
(line ringing)
Magnum, pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.377
Jin?
Magnum.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.420
Hello?

30:39.504 --> 30:41.923
Magnum!
Jin!

30:42.006 --> 30:42.840
Magnum! Damn!

30:55.144 --> 30:57.897
(engine starts)

30:57.981 --> 30:59.440
Jin, what's going on?

30:59.524 --> 31:00.483
I'm in the truck with Watts.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.693
What do you mean?

31:01.776 --> 31:02.819
He was getting away,

31:02.902 --> 31:04.654
so I snuck inside the truck bed.

31:04.737 --> 31:05.780
Why?
JIN: Heroes don't ask why.

31:05.863 --> 31:08.616
We just go on instinct.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.451
Now be a good sidekick
and do your nerdy ping thing.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.203
No, I'm saying, why'd you hop
in the back of the truck

31:13.705 --> 31:15.290
when you could've just thrown
your phone in?

31:15.373 --> 31:17.166
Way to ruin a heroic moment.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.668
Whatever. Just add me
to Find My Friends, all right?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.712
Oh, I'm really flattered
you're trying

31:20.795 --> 31:22.130
to take our relationship
to the next level.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.716
No, it's to track you, genius.

31:24.799 --> 31:26.843
Oh, yeah, hang on.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.636
(phone dings)

31:28.720 --> 31:30.263
(chimes)

31:30.346 --> 31:32.599
Okay, I...
I'm-I'm tracking you.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.312
Just-just hang tight
and don't do anything stupid.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.813
TC:
Keala, we're gonna
get you out of this.

31:38.896 --> 31:40.231
Just keep looking at me, okay?

31:40.315 --> 31:42.525
Please hurry!

31:47.739 --> 31:48.865
(vehicle approaching)

31:48.948 --> 31:51.159
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

31:54.120 --> 31:56.831
Oh, boy.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.000
Okay, buddy, I'm gonna
come to you, all right?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.835
Hop on.

32:00.918 --> 32:03.713
Where the hell'd you learn
to drive that thing?

32:03.796 --> 32:05.173
I worked construction for
my uncle back in the day.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.175
You sure you know
what you're doing?

32:08.134 --> 32:10.178
This is not my first rodeo.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.597
Okay.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.641
Okay, I'm good.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.860
Hang on tight.
I'm gonna send you out.

32:25.943 --> 32:27.904
I can't see anything.
You're gonna have to be my eyes.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.114
(Keala whimpering)

32:30.198 --> 32:31.949
Okay. A little to the left.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.870
KUMU: Okay.
A little more.

32:35.953 --> 32:36.871
Okay, there! Send me down.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.334
Okay.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.752
How much further?

32:46.464 --> 32:49.425
A few more feet.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.760
Okay, right there. Stop!

32:50.843 --> 32:52.345
Hey, buddy.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.222
You're gonna be okay.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.598
I just need you
to do one thing.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.433
I need you to let go
of those roots

32:57.517 --> 33:00.561
and grab onto me.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.230
I can't.
Look, I know you're scared,
but I got you.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.023
(screams)
I got you.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.322
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.077
Got you!
(grunts)

33:16.160 --> 33:18.788
I got you.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.123
Okay, Kumu, pull us up!

33:32.343 --> 33:34.387
Okay!

33:38.307 --> 33:40.810
(TC grunts)

33:40.893 --> 33:42.979
Trick or treat.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.772
(phone beeping)

33:44.856 --> 33:46.274
Come on.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.115
Where are you, Jin?

33:54.198 --> 33:55.742
(engine starts)

33:57.744 --> 34:00.788
(tires squeal)

34:15.553 --> 34:16.596
(ghostly wailing)

34:17.929 --> 34:19.514
(wailing continues)

34:19.599 --> 34:21.641
(phone ringing)

34:22.935 --> 34:24.896
(sighs)

34:24.978 --> 34:26.105
Yo.
MAGNUM: Rick!

34:26.188 --> 34:27.774
He is at the house.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.859
The Killer of Waianae is there!

34:29.942 --> 34:31.610
(chuckles):
Okay, cool. Maybe he's hungry.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.112
We can Postmates some poke.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.530
No, I'm not kidding! I-I...

34:34.614 --> 34:36.032
He stabbed a cop in the back,

34:36.114 --> 34:37.449
and I tracked him
to your location.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.409
He's at The Slaughterhouse!

34:38.493 --> 34:41.496
Oh, no.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.331
I just realized,
might be too late for poke.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.542
We might have to get
some acai or Froyo.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.293
Rick, listen to me!
I'm-I'm not kidding!

34:48.377 --> 34:51.047
Okay, pal. Listen, got to go.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.382
About to crack this case
wide open.

34:55.301 --> 34:58.304
Rick! Hello?

34:58.387 --> 35:00.014
(tires squeal)

35:01.974 --> 35:03.434
(wailing continues)

35:09.357 --> 35:11.234
(grunts)

35:11.317 --> 35:14.237
(cat meows)

35:14.320 --> 35:16.531
Higgy! You got to come
check this out!

35:16.614 --> 35:19.158
(cat meows)

35:19.242 --> 35:21.702
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
(door opens)

35:21.786 --> 35:24.539
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.415
(chuckles)
Higgins,

35:34.423 --> 35:36.259
you're not gonna...

35:36.342 --> 35:37.385
(line ringing)

35:37.468 --> 35:39.262
Come on, move it!

35:39.345 --> 35:40.888
Come on, come on, Rick.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.181
Come on, pick up the phone.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.724
(phone beeps)

35:43.808 --> 35:44.892
(horn honks)

35:44.976 --> 35:46.018
(phone rings)

35:46.102 --> 35:47.186
Jin!

35:47.270 --> 35:48.646
Watts just went in the house.

35:48.729 --> 35:49.897
Where are you?
MAGNUM: Listen to me,

35:49.981 --> 35:52.441
I'll be there soon, okay?

35:54.443 --> 35:56.195
HPD's on the way.
Just stay where you are.

36:10.167 --> 36:11.752

36:40.865 --> 36:43.034

37:12.772 --> 37:14.941

37:15.024 --> 37:17.401

(panting)

37:23.199 --> 37:25.785
(Rick gasping)

37:32.917 --> 37:35.378
Nice of you to join us.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.839
(indistinct chatter)

37:38.923 --> 37:40.174
Thomas, you should
have seen it. I mean,

37:40.257 --> 37:42.009
it was like a
pay-per-view event.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.304
Death match at The
Slaughterhouse.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.056
Higgy and Rick
versus the Waianae Killer.

37:47.139 --> 37:49.809
I mean, it was incredible.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.852
So, I just spoke with
Dr. Leslie Carpenter,

37:51.936 --> 37:54.355
head of mental health facilities
at Halawa.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.190
She treated Watts.
What did she have to say?

37:56.273 --> 37:57.984
Back in the day,
this house used to be

37:58.067 --> 37:59.360
the orphanage where
Watts grew up.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.236
He was apparently beaten
by the caretakers

38:00.319 --> 38:02.363
who ran the place.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.656
Must've reminded him
of all the suffering

38:03.739 --> 38:05.658
he went through as a kid.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.867
Exactly what Dr. Carpenter said.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.703
He associated everything

38:08.786 --> 38:09.870
and everyone in the house
with his misery.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.915
HIGGINS:
So that's why he murdered

38:12.999 --> 38:14.625
that family 20 years ago
and why he came back tonight.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.544
Putting together
everything she knows about him

38:16.627 --> 38:18.838
and what happened tonight,
Dr. Carpenter thinks

38:23.968 --> 38:26.387
he was gonna burn
the place down.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.389
You did good tonight.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.432
Hold on,
was that a compliment?

38:29.515 --> 38:30.599
Yeah.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.226
For Higgins and Rick.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.272
(chuckles):
Oh! Burn.

38:36.355 --> 38:39.734
(panting)
(chuckles)
Look at that.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.069
Katsumoto walks away, and
Jin just magically appears.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.988
Yeah, I can't help it.
I'm literally allergic to cops.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.157
Cops and shellfish.
(cat meows)

38:46.240 --> 38:47.450
Kitty! Hey.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.577
(clicking tongue)

38:49.660 --> 38:52.038
Hey, sweetie.

38:52.121 --> 38:54.582
HIGGINS: There is
your ghost, Thomas.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.250
Aw, he really likes you, Rick.
You gonna keep him?

38:56.333 --> 38:58.878
Well, Jin, I'm glad you ask,

38:58.961 --> 38:59.962
because it is a "paw-sibility."

39:00.046 --> 39:01.756
Oh, come on.
(laughing)

39:01.839 --> 39:04.592
Yeah? You like that?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.260
I'm actually allergic to cats
and terrible puns.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.346
I will see you guys later.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.275
(meows)

39:21.358 --> 39:23.444
How you feeling?

39:23.527 --> 39:25.613
Okay.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.615
Doc says I'll make
a full recovery.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.451
Good.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.204
Don't expect me
to start taking it easy on you.
(chuckles)

39:34.538 --> 39:36.123
I wouldn't dream of it.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.958
Can I ask you a question?

39:38.042 --> 39:39.752
Of course.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.463
When you told me
to remind my family

39:42.546 --> 39:45.007
that I was missing things
because I love them...

39:46.050 --> 39:49.053
were you speaking
from experience?

39:50.387 --> 39:52.973
More like regret.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.017
Got it.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.644
I understand missing out
on your kid

39:56.727 --> 39:59.313
when there's a mass murderer
on the loose,

39:59.396 --> 40:01.148
but what are you doing here now?

40:01.232 --> 40:02.858
You're my responsibility.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.156
And I'm fine.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.326
I already missed the days
of trick-or-treating.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.912
My son's a teenager now,
going to parties.

40:16.413 --> 40:18.415
Kind of too late
to take my own advice.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.836
Is it?

40:21.919 --> 40:23.504
Daddy!

40:23.587 --> 40:24.630
(gasps)
Is that what

40:24.713 --> 40:26.340
I think it is?

40:26.423 --> 40:28.175
It's the potato chip one.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.343
Whoa! That is exactly the kind

40:29.426 --> 40:30.845
the doctor said
would heal me up.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.513
(kisses)

40:32.596 --> 40:34.181
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.850
Did you miss me?
Yeah.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.184
You did?
Did you miss me?
Yeah.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.478
How much? This much?

40:45.568 --> 40:46.569
(Pono laughs)

40:49.488 --> 40:51.740
(phone beeps)

40:51.824 --> 40:53.659
Dennis, it's Dad.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.412
You free this weekend?

41:04.587 --> 41:07.047
I was wondering if you wanted
to grab pancakes at Cinnamon's.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.382
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

41:08.465 --> 41:10.801
What do you mean?

41:10.885 --> 41:12.887
You did all the heavy lifting.
Literally.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.231
(vehicle approaching)

41:24.315 --> 41:27.526
That must have been
some Halloween.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.111
Oh, you have no idea.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.571
Wow, TC.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.364
You're such a Boy Scout.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.743
Only the best
for the best.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.495
Did you get your man?
MAGNUM:
It's a long story.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.039
We didn't get our fish,
but we did

41:40.122 --> 41:41.749
get a bigger one,
didn't we?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.584
And now I'm out 50 grand.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.211
Come on, Jin. That wasn't
your money to begin with.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.795
RICK:
How about you two?
You guys just...

41:46.879 --> 41:48.422
sit around this nice, cozy fire

41:48.505 --> 41:51.050
and talk about your feelings
all night?

41:51.133 --> 41:53.260
That's a longer story.
Yeah.

41:53.344 --> 41:57.097
KAHU:
Aloha kakahiaka.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.725
Good morning. Aloha, Kumu.
Aloha, kahu.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.227
Mahalo.
(chuckles)
Mahalo. Aloha.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.104
Nice to see you here.

42:04.188 --> 42:06.565
Good to see you. Just wanted
to make sure you're not

42:06.649 --> 42:08.275
running amok
in my construction site.
(laughs)

42:08.359 --> 42:09.443
Mahalo, everybody,
for being here.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.570
Are you ready? Let's begin

42:15.366 --> 42:17.326
the blessing of the heiau.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.789
Would you join hands, please?

42:21.872 --> 42:23.290
You know, this heiau
is an impressive structure.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.961
On their own,

42:27.044 --> 42:28.629
these rocks are oddly shaped
and useless.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.131
But when they

42:31.215 --> 42:33.175
come together,

42:34.176 --> 42:36.303
they become stronger.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.973
They find a greater purpose.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.307
(speaking Hawaiian)

42:40.391 --> 42:42.643
And so, for us,

42:42.726 --> 42:44.353
together, we are a team.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.021
Let these rocks
represent us, too.
