01:17.042 --> 01:18.610
Hello, everybody.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.545
Where's Latka? Where's Latka?
     I got wonderful news.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.180
What is it, what is it?
              What is it?

01:22.248 --> 01:23.682
Here, you read this
for yourself.

01:23.749 --> 01:25.583
I got to go find Latka.

01:25.651 --> 01:27.018
Latka?

01:29.154 --> 01:35.693
<i>"Bleam niki schlev rosko iska</i>
     <i>bedosko pavitz iba da."</i>

01:35.761 --> 01:38.062
Is it, uh, from their country?

01:38.130 --> 01:39.297
Yeah, I guess so.

01:39.364 --> 01:42.367
The stamp commemorates,
        uh, goat cheese.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.401
There...

01:43.468 --> 01:45.036
LATKA:
No, no...

01:45.103 --> 01:46.238
no, no, no.

01:46.305 --> 01:48.906
Why, why, why, why, why?

01:48.974 --> 01:50.175
It's a wonderful job.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.977
You said I could get a job.

01:52.044 --> 01:54.445
This is one job
I don't want you to have.

01:54.513 --> 01:56.447
Hey, Simka, what kind
of a job did they offer you?

01:56.515 --> 01:59.050
I gave you that letter.
       I know, but I didn't have
             my reading glasses.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.752
So, uh, tell me, what
      kind of a job is it?

02:01.820 --> 02:03.588
You go ahead, you tell him.

02:05.024 --> 02:11.462
This just happens to be
  a letter from my government.

02:11.530 --> 02:15.466
They would like me to be
   the ambassador to France.

02:15.534 --> 02:17.235
The ambassador to France?

02:17.302 --> 02:18.936
That's right.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.506
Excuse me, Latka, but, uh,
I may be a little confused here.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.774
Read it.
    But isn't the, uh,

02:22.841 --> 02:25.543
ambassador to France a
        kind of prestigious job?

02:25.611 --> 02:27.145
Yes, I would say.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.447
It pays $2.75 a hour.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.084
Why does your country
             want to appoint you

02:33.151 --> 02:34.786
ambassador to France?

02:34.853 --> 02:38.657
Because I'm the only one
       who speaks French.

02:38.724 --> 02:41.626
Look, I don't want
to go to France.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.428
I am American.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.129
America is my country.

02:45.197 --> 02:46.697
You cannot have this job.

02:46.765 --> 02:49.668
Now are you going to,
            from now on, is pout

02:49.735 --> 02:52.670
and throw the temper tantrum and
  make my life hell from now on?

02:52.738 --> 02:54.038
<i>Oui.</i>

02:55.408 --> 02:58.643
Hey, she really
       does speak French.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.614
Hi, guys.
                           ALEX:
                            Hey.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.148
Hey, everybody.

03:04.216 --> 03:06.984
Oh, Elaine, I had such
         a wonderful time today.

03:07.052 --> 03:08.587
I had such a wonderful time,

03:08.654 --> 03:10.588
I'm not even going to
       pester you with questions

03:10.655 --> 03:12.123
about whether you had
               a wonderful time.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.691
Well, thank you, Arnie.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.293
However, if you'd care

03:15.361 --> 03:18.696
to volunteer the information,
         I'd be glad to hear it.

03:18.764 --> 03:20.765
I had a lovely time.

03:20.833 --> 03:21.999
So, uh, what'd you guys do?

03:22.067 --> 03:23.368
ARNIE:
Well...

03:23.435 --> 03:26.237
decency prevents me from
          divulging the details,

03:26.305 --> 03:29.507
but, you know, it had to do
    with water beds, baby oil...

03:29.575 --> 03:30.775
TONY:
                             Oh!
        Arnie!

03:30.842 --> 03:32.143
They know I'm kidding.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.845
Yeah, well, I don't
think they do.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.880
Really?
                Well, great.

03:37.115 --> 03:39.417
No, actually,
we went to an opening

03:39.485 --> 03:40.852
of a new gallery in SoHo.

03:40.919 --> 03:42.687
Ooh, he must
                really love you.

03:42.754 --> 03:43.688
ALEX:
Tony...

03:43.756 --> 03:45.490
I have to
go change, okay?

03:45.557 --> 03:48.192
Well, I probably won't be here
       when you get back,

03:48.260 --> 03:50.094
so you're gonna just have
      to kiss me good-bye

03:50.162 --> 03:51.129
in front of everybody.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.497
Bye, sweetie.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.733
(sighs, chuckles)

03:54.800 --> 03:58.269
Hey, Ross, I want
      to shake your hand.

03:58.337 --> 04:01.172
Well, I don't see
any harm in that.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.308
You know something?

04:03.375 --> 04:05.276
You've climbed Everest.

04:05.344 --> 04:06.811
What do you mean?

04:06.879 --> 04:08.112
Nardo.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.182
I mean, you know how many guys
        you beat out to get her?

04:11.250 --> 04:14.819
Well, I never thought
of it as a contest,

04:14.887 --> 04:16.254
but now that you mention it,

04:16.322 --> 04:19.991
I must say I went for
the gold and I got it!

04:20.058 --> 04:22.060
I'll see you later, Lou.

04:25.130 --> 04:26.564
You know what?

04:26.632 --> 04:30.168
I think it's his
       boyish insecurity.

04:30.235 --> 04:32.670
It's got to be.
     There's nothing else.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.251
(clearing throat)

04:50.055 --> 04:52.857
So, first day on the job.
          You like it?

04:52.924 --> 04:55.360
It's a job.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.930
Oh, gosh... (chuckles)

04:58.997 --> 05:00.631
I don't know
what came over me.

05:00.699 --> 05:02.400
I mean, I was so bold.
I mean...

05:02.467 --> 05:04.735
It's not like me
to be that way. I...

05:07.506 --> 05:09.674
Oh, look, I'm gonna come
right out and say it.

05:09.741 --> 05:13.911
I-I was wondering if,
uh, maybe, uh, you and I,

05:13.979 --> 05:17.381
we could, uh, we could
go have a soda.

05:17.449 --> 05:19.651
Really?

05:19.718 --> 05:21.252
That's charming.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.821
Aw... it's...

05:26.792 --> 05:28.158
Well, and, and,
    and then, may...

05:28.226 --> 05:30.428
Oh, no, I can't.
I can't, I can't do it.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.163
(whimpering)

05:32.231 --> 05:34.298
Go on.

05:34.366 --> 05:36.234
Well...

05:36.301 --> 05:39.037
I thought maybe then
I could walk you home

05:39.105 --> 05:41.873
and we could do it
till we pass out.

05:46.711 --> 05:47.946
Hey, I think it worked, Lou.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.714
You usually get slapped
     much harder than that.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.217
Oh, hey, Elaine.

05:53.285 --> 05:55.453
Now what's the scoop
    with you and this guy Arnie?

05:55.521 --> 05:58.122
I mean, I know
               the guy's gentle,

05:58.190 --> 06:00.591
and, and sensitive
                  and unassuring

06:00.659 --> 06:02.326
and likable and loving and...

06:02.394 --> 06:05.130
Wait, how do you
know all this?

06:05.197 --> 06:06.631
He's got to be, Elaine.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.133
I mean, but how
            serious are you two?

06:09.201 --> 06:10.402
I don't know.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.170
I don't even know
what kind of relationship

06:12.238 --> 06:13.438
I want with him yet.

06:13.505 --> 06:15.239
Hey, Elaine, what do
         your kids think of him?

06:15.307 --> 06:17.208
Are you kidding, Alex?
   The kids got to love him.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.509
He's like Yoda.

06:18.577 --> 06:20.311
Tony...

06:20.379 --> 06:24.448
No, actually, uh, he hasn't,
uh, met Jennifer and Jason yet.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.951
TONY: What?
         He hasn't met your kids
                 in five months?

06:27.019 --> 06:30.588
No. Actually, uh, I've been
   avoiding introducing them.

06:30.656 --> 06:31.656
Why?

06:31.723 --> 06:33.324
I don't want my kids
        to get involved

06:33.392 --> 06:36.060
with Arnie unless I'm sure that
I want to get involved with him.

06:36.128 --> 06:38.563
If things didn't work out
between Arnie and me, then

06:38.630 --> 06:40.364
I don't want
     the kids to get hurt.

06:40.432 --> 06:41.365
TONY:
                           Oh...

06:41.433 --> 06:43.501
Well, that sounds
        very reasonable.

06:43.569 --> 06:44.501
ELAINE:
Oh, good.

06:44.569 --> 06:46.070
I'm so glad you
agree with me.

06:46.137 --> 06:48.372
In an overprotective, paranoid
     sort of way is what I mean.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.674
No!
                    Huh?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.875
Because I have
    a favor to ask of you.
                          Me?

06:51.943 --> 06:53.778
Tomorrow night Arnie's coming
to the house for dinner

06:53.845 --> 06:55.546
and I've got to leave
the kids with someone.

06:55.614 --> 06:56.881
And their father's
out of town,

06:56.949 --> 06:59.116
so could you watch them
for a couple of hours?
                       Uh...

06:59.184 --> 07:00.918
Please, Alex, you're
the only one I can ask.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.887
I'm sorry, Elaine, but...
        Tony?

07:02.954 --> 07:05.256
Oh, uh, I'm sorry,
       Elaine, but, uh...

07:05.323 --> 07:06.257
Lupus?

07:06.325 --> 07:08.492
Lupus? Lu... Elaine!
                          Lupus?

07:08.560 --> 07:10.128
You're gonna trust
              your kids to a guy

07:10.196 --> 07:11.996
who promises never
                  to bathe again

07:12.063 --> 07:13.897
until Seattle wins
                 the Super Bowl?

07:13.965 --> 07:15.233
Please, that's
                    not the one.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.235
Never mind, Lupus.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.335
Forget it, Lup.

07:18.403 --> 07:20.404
What am I gonna do, Alex?

07:20.472 --> 07:22.807
Look, the simplest thing to do
   is let the guy meet the kids.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.242
I mean, big deal, come
          over, he'll say hello,

07:24.309 --> 07:25.476
pat the kids on the head

07:25.544 --> 07:26.744
and they'll both go
             off to their rooms.

07:26.811 --> 07:27.678
Quivering with excitement.

07:27.746 --> 07:29.046
ALEX:
Tony, please.

07:29.114 --> 07:30.748
I'm not saying that
           the guy wouldn't, uh,

07:30.815 --> 07:32.083
grow on the kids in time.

07:32.151 --> 07:36.587
Arnie is a quiet,
          unassuming guy, right?

07:36.655 --> 07:37.989
He's not the kind of guy

07:38.056 --> 07:40.424
that the kids are gonna fall
  in love with instantly, is he?

07:40.492 --> 07:44.095
Well, maybe you're right.

07:44.162 --> 07:45.896
I hope you're right.

07:45.964 --> 07:48.132
You'd better be right,
because tomorrow night

07:48.200 --> 07:50.201
those kids are having dinner
with Arnie and me.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.836
Hey, good, good.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.237
Good choice.

07:53.305 --> 07:55.139
You know...

07:57.242 --> 08:00.111
I once dated a woman

08:00.178 --> 08:04.415
whose kids were
      very attached to me.

08:04.483 --> 08:07.886
Eventually, she wanted
          to break up.

08:07.953 --> 08:09.887
Mm-hmm.
                           So...

08:09.954 --> 08:13.057
to make it easy
     on those little tykes,

08:13.125 --> 08:17.261
at our last dinner

08:17.328 --> 08:20.932
I pretended to have
       a heart attack...

08:25.036 --> 08:26.336
...and die.

08:26.404 --> 08:27.338
Yeah.

08:29.308 --> 08:33.711
After the children were
           sedated...

08:33.779 --> 08:37.780
and the woman stopped screaming,

08:37.849 --> 08:40.852
pounding me,

08:40.919 --> 08:42.352
she was

08:42.421 --> 08:45.456
profuse in her gratitude.

08:50.528 --> 08:52.596
I'm great with kids.

08:59.471 --> 09:01.038
Hi, everybody.

09:01.106 --> 09:02.673
<i>Bonjour, tout le monde.</i>

09:02.741 --> 09:04.642
Hi.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.544
She's been acting
    like a child

09:06.612 --> 09:09.947
because I won't let her
    be ambassador to France.

09:10.015 --> 09:12.283
How long are you going
    to keep this up?

09:12.351 --> 09:16.520
<i>Je vais continuer jusqu'à</i>
      <i>la fin de mes jours.</i>

09:18.590 --> 09:20.291
What does that mean?

09:20.359 --> 09:22.994
Uh, my French is a little
       rusty, but if I were you,

09:23.061 --> 09:25.863
I'd have someone taste
       my coffee in the morning.

09:25.931 --> 09:29.067
Okay, Simka,
      I have been selfish.

09:29.134 --> 09:31.169
You want the job,
    you can take it.

09:31.236 --> 09:33.838
Oh, Latka.

09:33.905 --> 09:36.641
Oh, Latka, my darling.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.944
Oh, I knew that you
            would love me enough

09:40.012 --> 09:43.714
to do the right thing if I
   made your life a living hell.

09:43.782 --> 09:47.051
But I got good news
                  for you, also.

09:47.118 --> 09:48.418
There's no job no more.

09:48.486 --> 09:49.654
What?

09:49.721 --> 09:53.324
No. I got another
       letter from the homeland.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.327
We broke off diplomatic
          relations with France.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.095
Oh, good, you're here.

09:58.163 --> 09:59.830
Hi, Arnie.

09:59.898 --> 10:04.569
Listen, Elaine has invited me
 home tonight to meet her kids.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.736
I really need your help.

10:05.804 --> 10:06.970
I mean, you know those kids.

10:07.038 --> 10:08.272
What do you suggest?

10:08.340 --> 10:10.074
Oh, come on. I don't know
        why everybody's

10:10.142 --> 10:11.676
making such
     a big deal about this.

10:11.743 --> 10:13.577
I mean, it's just a
     couple of kids, Arnie.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.847
Why on Earth are you
    so nervous about it?
TONY: Yeah.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.315
Because I want
                them to like me.

10:17.382 --> 10:19.150
I mean, you don't know
               the work it takes

10:19.217 --> 10:20.417
to get people to like me.

10:20.485 --> 10:23.087
I put out, man!

10:23.155 --> 10:25.622
And now I have to win
                  over two more.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.658
Arnie, why don't you
        give us a break?

10:27.726 --> 10:28.759
Them kids are pushovers.

10:28.827 --> 10:30.728
Well, not for me, they're not.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.530
I remember my childhood.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.967
The key to popularity was
 knowing how to play dodgeball

10:36.034 --> 10:38.469
and how to make those little
   sounds with your armpits.

10:38.536 --> 10:39.804
Well, I, I couldn't

10:39.872 --> 10:42.807
do those things then,
    and I can't do them now.

10:42.874 --> 10:44.808
Oh, that's easy, Arnie.

10:44.876 --> 10:47.778
You just go like this...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:47.845 --> 10:50.447
She wants to be
ambassador to France.
ALEX: Yeah.

10:50.515 --> 10:53.383
Listen, look, Arnie, Arnie,
Arnie, Arnie,

10:53.451 --> 10:54.652
just listen to me,
will you?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.088
All you got to do is go over
there and be yourself.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.689
That's all kids ever want.

10:58.757 --> 10:59.556
Oh, really?

10:59.624 --> 11:01.926
Was Buffalo Bob himself?

11:01.994 --> 11:04.429
Was Bozo the
                  Clown himself?

11:04.496 --> 11:06.930
I hear Mr. Rogers
is really like that.

11:06.998 --> 11:08.265
Tony, please.
Will you?

11:08.333 --> 11:09.834
Arnie, Arnie,
                     look, look.

11:09.902 --> 11:11.369
Just listen to me,
             huh? Just trust me.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.237
Look, I know those kids.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.672
I'm telling you,
              I know those kids.

11:14.739 --> 11:16.974
All you got to do is go
         over there, be yourself

11:17.042 --> 11:19.177
and don't talk down
            to them. That's all.

11:19.244 --> 11:21.712
All right, come on.
  Get your butts out of here.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.847
You got your cab assignments.
       Now hit the road.

11:23.915 --> 11:25.148
Hey, you two,

11:25.216 --> 11:29.119
get out of here. Your
          conjugal visit's over.

11:29.187 --> 11:30.921
I feel
a little foolish, Alex,

11:30.989 --> 11:34.591
and, uh, I want to thank you
for talking some sense into me.

11:34.659 --> 11:35.727
Yeah, yeah,
               anytime, anytime.

11:35.794 --> 11:37.061
Thanks.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.464
Hey, Ross.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.869
Did Nardo ever mention
     a guy named Peterson?

11:45.937 --> 11:47.304
No, why?

11:47.372 --> 11:49.206
Elaine adored him.

11:49.274 --> 11:52.643
When he met the kids,
                 they hated him.

11:52.710 --> 11:53.677
(makes gagging sound)

11:53.745 --> 11:55.846
Well, what happened to him?

11:55.914 --> 11:57.982
Nobody knows.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.385
But legend has it

12:01.453 --> 12:06.123
that on a cloudy,
                    foggy night,

12:06.191 --> 12:09.193
when the moon is full,

12:09.261 --> 12:11.762
you can hear his
                   voice saying,

12:11.830 --> 12:15.432
"Elaine, I thought we
        had something special...

12:15.500 --> 12:17.868
special... special..."

12:22.341 --> 12:25.509
You know, Jeff,
sometimes I hate myself.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.847
But it's moments like this
      that make up for it.

12:37.755 --> 12:39.123
ELAINE:
      <i>Arnie's gonna be here</i>
           <i>any minute,</i>

12:39.191 --> 12:41.225
<i>so I want you guys</i>
        <i>to be good, okay?</i>

12:41.293 --> 12:44.495
Mommy, what if
      he doesn't like us?

12:44.563 --> 12:47.664
Oh, well, I guess I'll have to
 trade you in for two new kids.

12:47.732 --> 12:48.732
(gasps)

12:48.800 --> 12:50.801
No, I'm kidding.

12:50.869 --> 12:52.869
Hey, Mom, what if he likes me
and not Jennifer?

12:52.937 --> 12:54.038
Can we trade her in?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.206
Well...
              Mom!

12:55.273 --> 12:58.676
No, never. We're a team.
          We're a set!

12:58.743 --> 13:00.577
It's all of us or none of us.

13:00.645 --> 13:01.845
Put 'er
                   there, pards.

13:01.913 --> 13:03.147
ALL:
              Hmm!

13:03.215 --> 13:04.882
(chuckling, knocking at door)

13:04.950 --> 13:06.150
Okay.

13:06.217 --> 13:08.018
Aw, he's here.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.286
Does he have
to stay long?

13:09.353 --> 13:11.689
Oh, come on, you
             guys. What is this?

13:11.756 --> 13:13.457
You're going to
              have a great time.

13:13.525 --> 13:15.459
(knocking continues)

13:20.065 --> 13:22.599
ARNIE:
         Hello, Jason.
        Hello, Jennifer.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.703
I'd like you to meet the
  greatest guy in the world...

13:25.771 --> 13:27.738
Arnie Ross!

13:27.805 --> 13:30.207
Wow!
                    Wow!
    Hey!

13:30.275 --> 13:31.576
Hi, Elaine!
                  Hi.

13:33.011 --> 13:34.879
Jason, this is for you.

13:34.946 --> 13:36.046
Thanks!

13:36.114 --> 13:37.114
Oh, I want one!

13:37.182 --> 13:38.449
Oh, I thought you might.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.618
Oh!
ELAINE: Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, you guys.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.120
You can play with those toys
later; I want you to meet Arnie.

13:43.187 --> 13:45.022
(kids shouting)
No, it won't be so bad.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.725
I'm going to make some
 balloon animals while we talk.

13:48.793 --> 13:50.728
Hey!

13:55.566 --> 14:00.237
Now, Jason, I'll bet the girls
are just crazy about you,

14:00.305 --> 14:03.941
but you don't give them
the time of day. Right?

14:05.944 --> 14:09.947
I'll bet your favorite
      sport is... soccer.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.317
But I'll bet you're
very interested in...

14:13.385 --> 14:15.887
veterinary medicine!

14:18.056 --> 14:20.524
Now, what's your
        favorite animal?

14:20.592 --> 14:22.259
A mouse or a rat?

14:23.761 --> 14:25.262
A mouse.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.598
Well, there ya go!

14:27.665 --> 14:29.599
Wow.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.571
Arnie, would you like
     to take off your coat?

14:34.639 --> 14:37.541
Are you kidding?
 I'm fighting for my life here.

14:37.609 --> 14:42.612
Now, uh, Jennifer, I'll bet
  you're in the third grade...

14:42.680 --> 14:44.515
(spluttering)

14:44.582 --> 14:46.149
And I'll bet

14:46.217 --> 14:48.452
that you're at the top
of your class.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.587
Ah!

14:51.589 --> 14:52.690
Now, what's
     your favorite animal?

14:52.758 --> 14:53.523
An octopus.

14:53.591 --> 14:54.926
Aw, give me a break.

14:54.993 --> 14:56.160
Then a snake.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.461
A snake!

14:57.529 --> 15:00.964
You're great!
          I like you!

15:01.032 --> 15:03.500
Thanks!

15:03.568 --> 15:05.202
Okay.
            (laughs)

15:05.270 --> 15:06.803
Let's relax now, right?

15:06.871 --> 15:09.206
Okay, come on, Arnie, give me
   your coat, and I-I'm gonna

15:09.274 --> 15:10.440
get you a drink, okay?

15:10.508 --> 15:12.376
A drink?
   In front of the children?

15:12.443 --> 15:15.779
Well, I don't want you to
 think I'm a reckless drinker.

15:15.847 --> 15:19.983
Arnie, some wine is not going
to seem reckless.

15:20.051 --> 15:23.353
Well, then let's all
      get stinking drunk!

15:23.421 --> 15:24.722
Just a joke, kids.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.290
It's a little adult humor.

15:30.528 --> 15:31.695
(sighs)

15:31.763 --> 15:32.763
Here.

15:32.830 --> 15:33.864
Well...

15:33.932 --> 15:37.401
Presents, balloons, drinks.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.736
This is turning into quite
     an evening, isn't it?

15:39.804 --> 15:42.339
I'd say you made quite
             a first impression.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.540
He sure has.

15:43.608 --> 15:45.042
Yeah, what's next?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.677
Next?

15:46.745 --> 15:48.245
I don't know.

15:48.313 --> 15:51.481
Uh... well, how about, um...

15:51.549 --> 15:53.383
What about money?!

15:53.451 --> 15:54.685
(cheering)

15:54.753 --> 15:56.686
No. No, wait, wait.

15:56.754 --> 15:59.890
Would, uh, 20 bucks apiece
    sound okay to you guys?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.158
(screaming)

16:01.226 --> 16:02.826
There you go.
                         ELAINE:
               No, no, no, wait.

16:02.894 --> 16:05.496
Jason, Jennifer, I want you
   to give his money back, okay?

16:05.564 --> 16:07.264
(all shouting)

16:07.332 --> 16:08.932
Why don't you guys go
       take your puppets

16:09.000 --> 16:10.100
and play in your room, okay?

16:10.168 --> 16:12.503
Okay? I want to
                  talk to Arnie.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.772
And don't forget
who bought them for you!

16:15.840 --> 16:20.378
Well, hail the conquering hero,
           huh, babe?

16:20.445 --> 16:22.546
I think your kids like me.

16:22.613 --> 16:24.915
Arnie, how could they like you?

16:24.982 --> 16:26.483
They-They didn't even meet you.

16:26.551 --> 16:28.251
They met somebody else.

16:28.319 --> 16:31.021
Well, did they like him?

16:31.089 --> 16:33.591
They love him.

16:33.658 --> 16:35.292
Well, good enough.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.194
Arnie, you can't
                   keep this up.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.963
The hell I can't!

16:39.031 --> 16:41.398
As long as there's
ice cream to scoop

16:41.465 --> 16:43.567
or a riddle to tell
      or a toy on a shelf,

16:43.634 --> 16:45.903
those kids are mine.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.838
Arnie, you don't have
        to keep this up.

16:47.906 --> 16:49.874
I don't want you to keep it up.

16:49.941 --> 16:52.676
I think I know
     what's troubling you.

16:52.743 --> 16:55.112
You've mistaken my behavior
    as some kind of attempt

16:55.180 --> 16:56.580
to buy your kids' affection.

16:56.647 --> 17:00.350
Oh, mistaken? Come on, you
      were doling out $20 bills.

17:00.418 --> 17:02.953
You were giving hard
       cash to-to small children

17:03.021 --> 17:04.253
so that they'd like you.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.123
I'm sorry, I got
               to ask those kids

17:06.190 --> 17:07.324
to give you
                that money back.

17:07.391 --> 17:08.358
Oh, no, don't do that.

17:08.425 --> 17:11.094
They'll think I'm a rat fink!

17:11.162 --> 17:13.696
All right, now look,
I've got an idea.

17:13.765 --> 17:15.165
Let them earn it.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.334
In return for the money,
they could just come over

17:17.402 --> 17:21.137
to my place tomorrow and put
in some copper plumbing.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.641
Well, that was easy.

17:23.708 --> 17:27.511
Let me handle this,
                   okay? Please?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.781
Jason! Jennifer!
               Come on out here.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.450
Yeah, Mom?

17:33.517 --> 17:36.853
Okay, I want you guys to give
  Arnie his money back. Okay?

17:36.921 --> 17:38.856
Wait a minute. I thought
we had that settled.
Yeah, uh, no, it's

17:38.923 --> 17:40.457
not settled.
          JENNIFER: Yeah, we get
              to keep the money.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.793
No, no, no...
       Of course they do.
  They want to keep the money.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.295
I mean, of course.

17:44.362 --> 17:46.263
You both know that it's not
   right to keep the money...

17:46.330 --> 17:47.431
(all clamoring indistinctly)

17:47.499 --> 17:48.799
Jason and Jennifer,

17:48.867 --> 17:51.135
I want you to give him
   his money back right now!

17:51.202 --> 17:53.137
You're ugly!
                  You're stupid!

17:53.205 --> 17:56.240
I hate you, Mom!

17:56.307 --> 17:58.575
(door slams)

18:01.379 --> 18:04.081
You have beautiful children,
            Elaine.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.718
Arnie, that scene
  should never have happened.

18:08.786 --> 18:12.289
I know you thought it was okay
 to give those kids that money,

18:12.356 --> 18:13.423
but as their mother, I didn't,

18:13.491 --> 18:14.825
and you should have
        respected that.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.827
I'm-I'm upset with you.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.198
Would $40 make
                you feel better?

18:22.433 --> 18:25.702
Elaine, I'm sorry.
              I tried very hard.

18:25.770 --> 18:29.172
Obviously, this has turned out
      in the worst possible way.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.007
I've estranged you
         from your own children.

18:31.075 --> 18:34.744
I mean, I just, I shouldn't be
  allowed to be around children.

18:34.812 --> 18:36.147
I don't understand children.

18:36.214 --> 18:37.514
I don't know how
      to talk to children.

18:37.582 --> 18:39.683
I should be sterilized.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.054
Arnie...

18:45.457 --> 18:47.690
Oh, great,
        more fireworks.

18:47.758 --> 18:49.059
Mommy?

18:49.127 --> 18:50.427
What?

18:50.495 --> 18:51.762
Mom, I'm sorry.

18:51.829 --> 18:53.229
You're pretty, you're
           smart and I love you.

18:53.297 --> 18:54.298
(laughing)

18:54.366 --> 18:55.699
I'm sorry, too, Mommy.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.367
You're the nicest
mother in New York.

18:57.435 --> 18:58.535
Aw.

18:58.603 --> 19:00.937
ELAINE: Well, I love
                  you guys, too.

19:01.005 --> 19:03.140
How about
    setting the table? Okay?

19:03.207 --> 19:04.275
Okay.
        Okay.
                   Okay.

19:04.342 --> 19:05.576
Come on, Jason.

19:08.145 --> 19:09.213
They're great kids, huh?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.614
Yeah.

19:10.681 --> 19:13.283
Look, Elaine, I know I've
   been screwing up tonight.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.587
I think if you'd just let me
     have a couple of words

19:16.654 --> 19:18.756
with the children,
    everything will be fine.

19:18.823 --> 19:20.557
Okay, go ahead.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.001
Kids...

19:31.068 --> 19:33.771
Good night.

19:33.838 --> 19:36.106
Oh, come on, Arnie,
 you've got to stay for dinner.

19:36.173 --> 19:38.341
No, I think I've caused
enough trouble for one night.

19:38.409 --> 19:40.610
Oh, but everybody would
     be upset if you left.

19:40.678 --> 19:42.646
Right?
            Arnie isn't leaving,
                   is he, Mommy?

19:42.714 --> 19:44.047
Yeah, please
            don't go, Arnie.

19:44.115 --> 19:45.549
We have the table
                 set up for you.

19:45.616 --> 19:47.384
We baked four potatoes.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.087
All right. Now, come on.
     Sit down for a minute.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.926
Now, listen.

19:55.994 --> 20:00.297
Now, this time I don't
have any more presents,

20:00.364 --> 20:04.100
and I'm not gonna give you
any more money.

20:04.168 --> 20:09.173
And from now on, whatever
     your mother says goes.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.874
Okay?

20:12.644 --> 20:13.744
Okay.

20:13.811 --> 20:17.180
You mean, you'd still like me?

20:17.248 --> 20:18.581
Yeah, sure.

20:18.649 --> 20:20.950
Just not as much.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.856
They're honest.

20:25.923 --> 20:27.825
Yeah. I like them.

20:35.666 --> 20:37.834
Elaine, that was
such a lovely meal.

20:37.902 --> 20:42.239
The kids were so great, and
everything just went so well.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.674
Mmm.

20:45.209 --> 20:47.144
Are you all right?

20:47.211 --> 20:49.646
Mm-hmm.

20:49.714 --> 20:52.148
Well...

20:52.216 --> 20:54.518
why don't you tell me
what's the matter?

20:54.585 --> 20:56.519
Okay.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.490
Arnie, don't get me wrong.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.658
I mean, this really doesn't
      have anything to do

21:01.725 --> 21:03.593
with you and me specifically.

21:03.661 --> 21:06.263
It's just that...

21:06.331 --> 21:07.564
it just worries me a little

21:07.632 --> 21:11.067
when my kids get
    so emotionally attached

21:11.135 --> 21:12.636
to a man that I'm dating.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.639
Well, I don't think you have
   any cause for worry here.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.308
I'd hardly say
 they've become attached to me.

21:18.376 --> 21:20.677
BOTH:
        Good night, Uncle Arnie.
        Good night, Uncle Arnie.

21:20.745 --> 21:23.280
Hey, good night, kids.
              Mmm!

21:23.348 --> 21:25.249
Are you really taking us
to the zoo tomorrow?

21:25.317 --> 21:26.883
Well, I said I would,
           didn't I?

21:26.951 --> 21:27.884
Yay, Uncle Arnie!

21:27.952 --> 21:30.253
JASON:
Yeah, he's the greatest.

21:30.321 --> 21:32.823
All right, now, you two,
  you know it's your bedtime!

21:32.891 --> 21:34.558
Good night, Mom.
                     Good night.

21:34.626 --> 21:35.959
I love you.
Good night, Mommy.

21:36.027 --> 21:37.027
Good night, baby.

21:37.094 --> 21:39.496
I'm gonna sleep
with my puppet tonight.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.665
And I'm gonna name my
             goldfish after you.

21:41.733 --> 21:42.699
Oh, great!

21:42.767 --> 21:44.768
Aw...
          Good night.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.070
Good night.
                Good night.

21:46.137 --> 21:48.638
Arnie's even cuter
          than Ricky Schroeder.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.544
Ah, ten minutes after I'm gone,

21:54.612 --> 21:56.379
they won't even know
        I've been here.

21:56.447 --> 21:59.516
Arnie, they love you.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.584
Well, I guess so.

22:01.652 --> 22:02.952
But that could be fixed.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.488
What do you say I march in there

22:04.556 --> 22:07.691
and, uh, kick their butts
       all over the room?

22:07.759 --> 22:11.328
Really, I-I'm-I'm delighted that
       my kids love you so much.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.030
Really. It's just
           that it's-it's put me

22:14.098 --> 22:15.732
in sort of an
               awkward position.

22:15.799 --> 22:18.935
You mean, this is more serious
        than I thought?

22:20.538 --> 22:22.205
Could be.

22:22.273 --> 22:24.207
In other words,
     you don't really know

22:24.275 --> 22:26.143
quite where
   our relationship is going,

22:26.210 --> 22:28.579
and you don't really know quite
     how you feel about me,

22:28.646 --> 22:30.180
so the fact
     that your kids like me

22:30.248 --> 22:33.550
might make it more difficult
          to break up.

22:33.618 --> 22:35.619
Uh-huh.

22:39.223 --> 22:44.995
That's a really terrible
position that I put you in.

22:45.063 --> 22:49.265
I-I think this might call
    for-for some champagne.

22:55.473 --> 22:57.474
You're such a dear man.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.409
Oh, I-I'm glad you think so

22:59.477 --> 23:02.311
because now, you know,
   you may be stuck with me.

23:06.684 --> 23:08.585
I guess I am.

23:08.653 --> 23:10.654
You know what?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.456
What?

23:12.523 --> 23:15.625
I love it.

23:15.693 --> 23:17.627
(both chuckling)

23:31.776 --> 23:35.445
(theme song playing)

23:56.267 --> 23:57.601
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:57.669 --> 23:58.768
(man grumbling)
