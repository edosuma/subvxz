00:04.583 --> 00:08.000
(male #1)
'And so you understand
our concern, Mollari.'

00:08.083 --> 00:10.292
'As well as preventing
other races'

00:10.375 --> 00:12.333
'from gaining the upper hand'

00:12.417 --> 00:17.042
we must continue to forge good
relations with possible allies.

00:17.125 --> 00:20.292
Yes, I understand,
but it's not an easy process.

00:20.375 --> 00:24.250
Very few here
are as, uh, trusting as I am.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.917
Ambassador--

00:26.000 --> 00:28.958
But I will see what I can do.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.417
Thank you.

00:30.500 --> 00:33.083
I'm sure
the emperor will be pleased

00:33.167 --> 00:36.958
by any progress
you make in this area.

00:37.792 --> 00:39.417
I'll be in touch.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.375
"I'll be in touch."

00:42.458 --> 00:44.083
Touch this.

00:48.458 --> 00:49.625
Yeah.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.875
- Morning, ambassador.
- Lennier.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.667
Lennier, when did you say

00:53.750 --> 00:56.792
Ambassador Delenn was due
back from your homeworld?

00:56.875 --> 00:59.917
In a few more days.
I'll tell her you inquired.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.792
Uh, you know, it occurs to me

01:01.875 --> 01:05.042
we haven't spent much time
together, you and I.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.958
I hardly know
anything about you.

01:08.042 --> 01:09.917
From birth
I was raised in the temple

01:10.000 --> 01:12.208
and studied the ways
of the religious caste.

01:12.292 --> 01:16.250
Six months ago I came here.
There is nothing else.

01:16.333 --> 01:20.500
Ah. Most unfortunate.

01:20.583 --> 01:22.500
Well, good day.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.792
E-excuse me, ambassador.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.333
Why do you say, "Unfortunate?"

01:27.417 --> 01:29.750
Well, the assistant
to an ambassador

01:29.833 --> 01:31.250
should know everything he can

01:31.333 --> 01:34.333
about the other species
here on Babylon 5, yes?

01:34.417 --> 01:37.167
Yes, I've been doing quite a bit
of reading since my arrival.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.583
- Reading?
- Yes.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.458
Reading is no substitute
for experience.

01:41.542 --> 01:45.208
Tell you what, it is an
imposition on my busy schedule

01:45.292 --> 01:47.500
but I'll take you under my wing

01:47.583 --> 01:49.667
and fill the gaps
in your education.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.917
Starting tomorrow morning
and for the next two days

01:53.000 --> 01:57.583
I will show you the Babylon 5
that I know.

01:57.667 --> 02:01.833
You will find that a revelation
of the highest order.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.667
I-I don't know, ambassador.

02:03.750 --> 02:08.208
Oh, my good, dear friend

02:08.292 --> 02:09.917
trust me.

02:11.667 --> 02:15.417
Will the defendant,
Karl Edward Mueller

02:15.500 --> 02:16.917
please rise?

02:18.792 --> 02:22.583
You were charged with the
calculated and unprovoked murder

02:22.667 --> 02:24.333
of two
of this station's residents

02:24.417 --> 02:27.792
'as well as the brutal
and senseless slaying'

02:27.875 --> 02:29.333
of a security officer.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.042
This court has reviewed
the charges against you

02:31.125 --> 02:35.417
and the evidence supplied by
the Office of Station Security.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.208
In light of that evidence,
this court finds you

02:37.292 --> 02:41.208
guilty of murder
in the first-degree.

02:41.292 --> 02:43.375
Sentence will be handed down
at 10 a.m. tomorrow

02:43.458 --> 02:45.875
Earth Standard Time.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.667
And may God have mercy
upon your soul.

02:52.208 --> 02:55.667
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:55.750 --> 02:58.958
ten years
after the Earth-Minbari War.

02:59.042 --> 03:02.417
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.542
Its goal,
to prevent another war

03:04.625 --> 03:06.958
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

03:07.042 --> 03:09.750
could work out
their differences peacefully.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.792
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:12.875 --> 03:14.667
for diplomats, hustlers

03:14.750 --> 03:17.792
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:17.875 --> 03:22.250
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

03:22.333 --> 03:26.417
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.792
It can be a dangerous place

03:29.875 --> 03:33.042
but it's our last, best hope
for peace.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.958
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.250
The year is 2258.

03:39.333 --> 03:43.208
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:43.292 --> 03:46.333
[theme music]

04:12.125 --> 04:15.208

04:24.750 --> 04:27.792
[intense music]

04:39.583 --> 04:42.625
[woman coughing]

04:45.500 --> 04:49.167
- I'd like to see the doctor.
- The line forms at the rear.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.708
I'm sure it does.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.125
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, please go right in.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.833
I'll buzz the doctor.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.208
(Stephen)
'Alright. There you go.'

05:01.292 --> 05:02.875
Take two every 12 hours
for the pain.

05:02.958 --> 05:05.125
If it comes back, you come back
and see me, alright?

05:05.208 --> 05:06.875
Thanks, doc.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.417
You can start
by removing your clothes.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.167
Not without dinner and flowers.

05:12.250 --> 05:15.167
Oh, lieutenant commander,
what are you doing down here?

05:15.250 --> 05:18.333
What a coincidence. I was about
to ask you the same thing.

05:18.417 --> 05:21.125
[chuckles]
Just doing my job.

05:21.208 --> 05:23.708
Your job is chief of staff
for the Medlab facility.

05:23.792 --> 05:27.208
No, my job is healing people.
Medlabs aren't free.

05:27.292 --> 05:29.458
'Not everyone can afford
to come for treatment'

05:29.542 --> 05:30.458
especially in Downbelow.

05:30.542 --> 05:32.000
Well, they have my sympathies

05:32.083 --> 05:34.417
but this is
an unauthorized clinic.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.833
- This is a free clinic.
- Same thing.

05:36.917 --> 05:39.083
The taxpayers back home
expect us to be self-supporting.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.250
They wouldn't approve
of diverting

05:40.333 --> 05:41.667
medicine, supplies, resources--

05:41.750 --> 05:43.250
I know.
That's why I didn't tell you.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.500
I don't like
having to hear about this

05:44.583 --> 05:46.083
in the grapevine, doctor.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.792
I'm in charge
of station operations.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.167
This is a station

05:49.250 --> 05:52.500
and this
is certainly for operations.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.333
Alright, fine, but right now

05:54.417 --> 05:56.000
there's about a dozen people
out there waiting to see me.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.917
Now what do you intend
to do about that?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.083
Nothing.

05:59.167 --> 06:01.958
And there's only half dozen.
I counted.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.583
'Look, I don't mind if you bend
the rules a little, doctor.'

06:04.667 --> 06:06.750
I mean, I bend a few myself.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.750
But I do like to be informed.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.167
If I'm gonna share in the blame

06:10.250 --> 06:12.417
I'd at least like to share
in some of the fun.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.250
Alright. You can start
by taking off your jacket.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.917
There's a sink in the back,
you can wash your hands and--

06:18.000 --> 06:19.750
- I am not a doctor.
- No.

06:19.833 --> 06:22.167
But I'm sure we can find
something for you to do.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.583
I mean,
if you're gonna join in the fun

06:23.667 --> 06:25.833
you might as well
go all the way, right?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.292
Half a dozen?
Where's all the rest?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.333
And I say we space the creep.

06:38.417 --> 06:39.625
A couple of hours in hard vacuum

06:39.708 --> 06:41.667
will do him and the gene pool
a world of good.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.667
If you don't mind
my saying so, Mr. Garibaldi

06:43.750 --> 06:45.625
you seem to be taking this
very personally.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.958
Damn straight,
this guy killed two Lurkers

06:48.042 --> 06:50.292
and scragged one of my men.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.500
But more than that, he..

06:53.375 --> 06:55.458
What?

06:55.542 --> 06:58.333
This wasn't the first time
for this guy, commander.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.875
The way he killed them,
cool, methodical..

07:01.958 --> 07:05.167
He's done this before. I'd bet
good money he's done this a lot.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.625
But you have no evidence
to that effect.

07:07.708 --> 07:08.583
No.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.167
'Then there's nothing I can do.'

07:10.250 --> 07:11.417
Spacing is only invoked

07:11.500 --> 07:14.833
under conditions
of mutiny or treason.

07:14.917 --> 07:19.208
For the crime of murder,
there are only three penalties

07:19.292 --> 07:21.333
legally open to us.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.833
The first option is to send him
to a prison back to Earth.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.667
I checked. They don't want him.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.875
And they won't pay the money
to send him anywhere else.

07:28.958 --> 07:30.875
And there isn't room in the brig
for the perps we've got now

07:30.958 --> 07:32.750
let alone
putting somebody away for life.

07:32.833 --> 07:36.208
Which leaves us
only option three.

07:36.292 --> 07:38.167
And that brings us back to you,
Ms. Winters.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.708
[exhales sharply]
I don't wanna do this again.

07:41.792 --> 07:46.042
I was inside a killer's mind
before on the Mars colony.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.333
There's gotta be another way.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.375
If you could get another
registered telepath

07:49.458 --> 07:50.875
in here to carry the burden..

07:50.958 --> 07:52.333
I've tried, the corps

07:52.417 --> 07:54.542
promised to send someone
as soon as they can.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.500
Unfortunately,
there's a shortage of telepaths

07:56.583 --> 07:58.042
trained in criminal cases.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.667
Why? Seems like there'd be
a lot of demand for that.

08:00.750 --> 08:04.167
Oh, there's demand,
just not much motivation.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.625
It's very stressful.
We burn out fast.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.708
Maybe when you're inside
his head, you can poke around

08:08.792 --> 08:10.167
'see if this guy's
killed before.'

08:10.250 --> 08:12.292
Mr. Garibaldi,
you know better than that.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.500
Scanning along those lines

08:13.583 --> 08:15.375
violates
the right of due process.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.208
Anything the telepath sees

08:17.292 --> 08:20.792
whilst inside a defendant's mind
is inadmissible evidence..

08:20.875 --> 08:22.292
But he's already
been found guilty.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.583
Of this crime, yes.

08:23.667 --> 08:25.167
But he hasn't been charged with
anything else.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.500
And I will not condone
a fishing expedition.

08:27.583 --> 08:31.458
Take the guilty verdict
and be grateful, Mr. Garibaldi.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.042
Ms. Winters,
I'm prepared to pass sentence

08:36.125 --> 08:39.625
and I need your help
to monitor the process.

08:39.708 --> 08:41.250
Can I count on you?

08:41.333 --> 08:44.375
[instrumental music]

08:52.333 --> 08:54.083
Excuse me.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.083
I'm a little bit turned
around here.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.583
I-I'm looking for Brown 27-G.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.042
A woman by the name
of Laura Rosen.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.917
She's supposed to be
around here somewhere.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.958
It's right over there.
Uh, what do you want with her?

09:05.042 --> 09:06.792
Well, I've been hearing
about some kind of quack

09:06.875 --> 09:08.750
practicing medicine
without a license.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.625
A cross between a faith healer

09:10.708 --> 09:13.625
and a sideshow medicine man,
or a woman in this case.

09:13.708 --> 09:17.167
I'm sure it's all
a misunderstanding. Good luck.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.208
Mm. Alright.

09:23.833 --> 09:27.083
- 'Ow!'
- 'A little more.'

09:27.167 --> 09:29.292
(Laura)
'There.'

09:29.375 --> 09:32.667
'There. How's the pain now?'

09:32.750 --> 09:35.292
- 'Better.'
- 'Good.'

09:35.375 --> 09:38.333
Well, this should begin
to decrease the growth.

09:38.417 --> 09:41.208
- How will I know if it worked?
- Oh, you'll know.

09:41.292 --> 09:44.875
My treatments never fail.
Well, that should do it.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.625
Mm. Thank you.

09:48.708 --> 09:50.167
- How much do I--
- Oh.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.708
Whatever you'd like to pay
is sufficient.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.208
Just leave your contribution
in the box by the door

09:55.292 --> 09:56.917
on your way out.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.250
Thank you.

10:00.792 --> 10:02.417
Ah, hello, doctor.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.958
I wondered how long it would
take you to pay me a visit.

10:06.042 --> 10:08.042
One healer to another.

10:08.125 --> 10:11.458
Well, it took me a while
to notice the drop in patients.

10:12.542 --> 10:15.458
- This is, uh..
- Alien. Yes.

10:16.708 --> 10:20.167
This writing, what does it say?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.333
The specifics? I don't know.

10:22.417 --> 10:26.208
I've only been able to decipher
the most general of meanings.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.375
In other words, you don't know
what it is or what it does

10:29.458 --> 10:30.583
or even if it works at all.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.208
Oh, it works, alright.

10:32.292 --> 10:35.333
It restores, renews,
invigorates.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.333
It's good for ailments
of the flesh

10:37.417 --> 10:39.167
the blood and the bone.

10:39.250 --> 10:42.458
Everything from the common cold
to Stafford's disease.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.542
For a modest contribution,
of course.

10:44.625 --> 10:48.542
Oh, I leave that detail up
to the conscience my patients.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.375
Hm. Well..

10:50.458 --> 10:53.542
(Stephen)
'You have
quite an operation here.'

10:53.625 --> 10:56.625
Ms. Rosen, does the term
con-job ring a bell?

10:56.708 --> 11:00.667
My mother is not a fake
or an evil woman or a quack.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.375
You didn't tell me
that she was your mother.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.667
You didn't ask.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.375
Doctor, my mother
isn't hurting anyone.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.125
Yes, she is
if she's discouraging people

11:07.208 --> 11:08.250
from seeking proper treatment.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.583
Don't like the competition?

11:09.667 --> 11:12.083
- Doctor?
- I have a problem with frauds.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.792
If that's what you mean.
And this--

11:13.875 --> 11:15.000
I'm sorry, I'm afraid

11:15.083 --> 11:16.792
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.458
My mother's very tired
after her sessions.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.042
As a doctor,
I'm sure you can understand

11:21.125 --> 11:22.875
'my concern for her health.'

11:22.958 --> 11:26.625
Alright, but as a doctor,
I'll be back.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.583
You can count on it.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.208
(male #2)
'Karl Edward Mueller'

11:36.292 --> 11:38.208
'this court
has reviewed its findings'

11:38.292 --> 11:41.833
and is now prepared
to render judgment.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.958
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is passed?

11:45.042 --> 11:46.917
Stroke off.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.750
Under the authority
of the Earth Alliance Court

11:49.833 --> 11:52.292
I cannot sentence you to death.

11:52.375 --> 11:56.542
A life taken will not balance
the loss of another life.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.167
Therefore,
it's the decision of this court

11:58.250 --> 12:01.292
that you be sentenced
to the death of personality.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.458
'You will be conveyed under
guard to a Medlab facility'

12:04.542 --> 12:07.958
where you'll be telepathically
scanned and then brainwiped.

12:08.042 --> 12:10.458
The personality
of Karl Edward Mueller

12:10.542 --> 12:14.042
will be totally
and completely erased.

12:14.125 --> 12:17.833
'You will then be programmed
with a new set of memories.'

12:17.917 --> 12:20.625
For the rest
of your natural life

12:20.708 --> 12:24.583
you will serve the community
harmed by your actions.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.875
The scan will be conducted
this afternoon

12:28.958 --> 12:31.625
and sentence will be carried out
at midnight tonight.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.167
[gavel bangs]

12:33.250 --> 12:36.917
Erase me?
I'll see you in hell first!

12:37.000 --> 12:40.833
All of you! You're already dead,
and you don't even know it!

12:40.917 --> 12:45.417
'You're dead!
All of you, you're dead!'

12:45.500 --> 12:47.042
'You're dead!'

12:49.083 --> 12:50.917
[instrumental music]

12:52.167 --> 12:54.167
(Garibaldi)
'Real piece of work, isn't he?'

12:54.250 --> 12:57.625
- 'When does he get wiped?'
- Midnight tonight.

12:57.708 --> 12:58.833
I'll have to check the equipment

12:58.917 --> 13:00.250
make sure
the process is painless.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.292
Do me a favor.
Don't check too close.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.167
If there's a little pain,
I won't mind.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.542
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

13:05.625 --> 13:07.417
Look, he iced
one of my best men.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.792
The guy had a family, two kids,
on the edge of getting promoted.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.333
- It's not right.
- And this is right?

13:11.417 --> 13:14.083
- It's the law.
- That's not what I asked.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.542
I'll take care of the machine,
Mr. Garibaldi.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.208
I assume you will arrange
for someone to throw the switch?

13:20.292 --> 13:22.542
Oh, I've got volunteers
backed up 12 deep.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.792
Mm. More is the pity.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.208
Oh, one more thing.

13:28.292 --> 13:30.667
A favor in exchange for this.

13:30.750 --> 13:31.958
I need some information
on a woman

13:32.042 --> 13:33.458
by the name of Laura Rosen.

13:33.542 --> 13:35.875
She's running a questionable
operation in Downbelow.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.000
Illegal?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.208
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.458
I'll have it for you in an hour.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.042
Come, come, come, come, come.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.833
You are going to enjoy this
very much.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.417
You will see.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.708
[chuckles]

13:56.250 --> 13:59.333
[instrumental music]

14:03.333 --> 14:06.875
Lennier. Lennier, this way.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.542
Ambassador, I-I'm really not
sure that this is a good idea.

14:10.625 --> 14:12.083
Oh, nonsense.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.625
I'm perfectly happy
to inconvenience myself

14:14.708 --> 14:15.833
for your benefit.

14:15.917 --> 14:19.750
Ah, Mertana, light of my life.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.458
Two of the usual, please.

14:22.542 --> 14:25.625
- Ambassador, this place--
- Amazing, yes?

14:25.708 --> 14:27.875
- Well..
- Here, my friend.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.792
Here you will see

14:29.875 --> 14:33.250
the heart and soul of Babylon 5

14:33.333 --> 14:36.417
'also its spleen, its kidneys'

14:36.500 --> 14:40.292
a veritable parade
of internal organs.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.458
Sit, sit.

14:47.042 --> 14:49.708
The thing you must remember here
is, uh..

14:50.833 --> 14:52.958
...is, uh..

14:53.042 --> 14:54.458
Ambassador?

14:54.542 --> 14:58.458
It seems I've left
my credit chit in my quarters.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.875
I don't suppose
you brought yours, hm?

15:00.958 --> 15:02.792
Well, yes, I-I-I did

15:02.875 --> 15:05.750
but, but my allowance
is-is very small.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.458
Oh, no, don't apologize.
We'll make do.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.125
Oh, it's-it's just that
I don't think Delenn would..

15:13.375 --> 15:15.375
Thank you.

15:15.458 --> 15:19.750
Here, give yourself a nice tip.
He's a very generous man.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.500
Thanks.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.292
Here's to our new friendship,
Lennier.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.792
Lennier.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.375
There's no alcohol in here,
is there?

15:30.458 --> 15:34.125
Alcohol? No, of course not.
Here, drink up.

15:34.208 --> 15:38.167
Because my people do not
react well at all to alcohol.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.792
Even a small quantity
causes psychotic impulses

15:41.875 --> 15:44.333
and-and violent homicidal rages.

15:44.417 --> 15:47.000
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.458
Alcohol. My mistake.

15:49.542 --> 15:53.208
Mertana, uh, just water for him.
Thank you.

15:53.292 --> 15:55.167
[chuckles]

15:55.250 --> 15:58.333
[instrumental music]

15:59.042 --> 16:00.875
[laughs]

16:02.542 --> 16:05.458
(woman on PA)
'Now playing in Duplex Beta
on Red-7..'

16:05.542 --> 16:07.625
[indistinct chatter on PA]

16:08.875 --> 16:10.375
Hi.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.833
I, uh, wanted to know if I could

16:11.917 --> 16:13.750
talk to you for a few minutes
if you don't mind?

16:13.833 --> 16:15.125
I have a quota to make,
or the boss

16:15.208 --> 16:17.333
will take it out of my salary.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.167
That enough?

16:27.708 --> 16:29.708
According
to the station registry

16:29.792 --> 16:32.875
your mother was a doctor,
a real doctor.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.750
That's right.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.833
- Well, then why--
- You wouldn't understand.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.167
Try me.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.833
All her life, the only thing

16:42.917 --> 16:45.667
that mattered to my mother
was being a doctor.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.667
A healer.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.208
She worked days,
nights, weekends.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.750
But she could never keep up
with it all

16:51.833 --> 16:54.917
so she started taking stims

16:55.000 --> 16:57.292
to stay up nights, working.

16:57.375 --> 17:00.250
Pretty soon she was taking them
all the time.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.500
She was addicted.

17:02.583 --> 17:06.625
She wouldn't admit it and
she wouldn't listen to anyone..

17:06.708 --> 17:09.792
[sighs]
...until one day
she made a mistake.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.875
Someone died.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.250
I'm sorry.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.542
When they took away her license

17:17.625 --> 17:20.042
they took away
her reason for living.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.083
Then one day she decided
that if she could find

17:22.167 --> 17:24.625
some new alien
healing technology

17:24.708 --> 17:28.792
she could come back, vindicated

17:28.875 --> 17:31.000
and they'd give her back
her life.

17:32.292 --> 17:35.250
That was three years ago.
And now--

17:35.333 --> 17:37.542
And now she thinks
she's found it.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.917
What do you think?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.417
I think..

17:45.208 --> 17:46.958
I think that for the first time
in years

17:47.042 --> 17:49.125
I see my mother smiling.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.625
For the first time,
I see hope in her eyes.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.292
Janice,
her machine doesn't work.

17:53.375 --> 17:56.625
How do you know?
Have you tested it? Examined it?

17:56.708 --> 17:59.708
No. But if it was real,
why are you still here?

17:59.792 --> 18:01.833
Why aren't you back on Earth
so she can show everyone

18:01.917 --> 18:03.125
her new discovery?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.125
- We don't have the money.
- Yes, you do.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.667
I checked the station logs.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.000
Your account has enough credits

18:08.083 --> 18:10.333
for two tickets back to Earth.

18:10.417 --> 18:13.208
But she doesn't know that, does
she? You don't want her to know.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.167
- You don't want anyone to know.
- Doctor!

18:15.250 --> 18:17.250
My mother
is not a young or well woman.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.833
At most
she has a few years left.

18:19.917 --> 18:21.792
I never wanna see her
as she was before

18:21.875 --> 18:24.292
defeated and lost and hopeless.

18:25.583 --> 18:28.917
She's a healer again,
and that's all that matters.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.250
Please don't try
and take that away from her

18:30.333 --> 18:33.333
because if you do,
I'll fight you.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.042
And I'll win.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.333
(Lennier)
'In my eleventy-fifth year
in the temple'

18:45.417 --> 18:47.667
I began to study the 97 dialects

18:47.750 --> 18:49.542
and sub-tongues
of our homeworld.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.708
And I discovered
something truly amazing.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.375
- Yes?
- Yes.

18:54.458 --> 18:56.458
The same word N'Kai

18:56.542 --> 18:59.542
appears in every Minbari dialect
and sub-tongue

18:59.625 --> 19:02.875
yet it never means
the same thing twice.

19:02.958 --> 19:07.500
For instance,
it can mean sand, father, boot.

19:07.583 --> 19:11.333
Really?
That's astonishing. Truly.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.542
Kill me.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.542
After my eleventy-seventh year

19:15.625 --> 19:19.375
I focused my area of inquiry
towards mathematics

19:19.458 --> 19:23.042
and I began to specialize
in probability.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.708
Probability?

19:24.792 --> 19:27.708
As in, determining the odds
of something happening?

19:27.792 --> 19:32.792
Yes, exactly. I achieved
the rank of master adept.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.500
My dear good friend Lennier..

19:36.708 --> 19:38.167
...come with me.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.292
But, uh, they're about
to begin another dance.

19:40.375 --> 19:41.250
Yes.

19:41.333 --> 19:42.917
But you said
that by interpreting

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
the movements
of certain body parts

19:45.083 --> 19:47.958
it would help me to better
understand other cultures.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.375
Later, later.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.833
Right now
I want to introduce you

19:51.917 --> 19:55.583
to the ultimate means
of interstellar understanding.

19:55.667 --> 19:59.417
- The Earthers call it poker.
- Poker?

19:59.500 --> 20:02.583
[chuckles]
Come. Come.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.125
[sighs]

20:32.500 --> 20:35.417
[door whirring]

20:40.208 --> 20:42.125
Mr. Mueller, I'm here to perform

20:42.208 --> 20:44.958
the court-ordered scan
prior to brainwipe.

20:45.042 --> 20:48.750
I can produce the order
if you want to see it.

20:48.833 --> 20:53.292
So you're going to walk around
in my head, eh?

20:53.375 --> 20:54.917
'I'd think twice if I were you.'

20:55.000 --> 20:58.500
Something might just jump out
of the shadows and bite you.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.250
Any attempted intimidation
will go on your record.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.667
So?

21:02.750 --> 21:04.833
It's not like I'm going
to remember any of this.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.833
That's the plan, right?

21:06.917 --> 21:08.458
Take away my thoughts,
my memories

21:08.542 --> 21:09.958
everything that makes me me

21:10.042 --> 21:12.083
so they can put me to work
for the rest of my life

21:12.167 --> 21:13.875
mopping floors,
cleaning toilets--

21:13.958 --> 21:15.333
Mr. Muller, if you continue this

21:15.417 --> 21:17.667
I will have to ask the guards
to restrain you.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.417
Is that what you want?

21:25.083 --> 21:28.917
Good. If you'll please sit.
This will only take a minute.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.083
[instrumental music]

21:59.792 --> 22:02.875
[music continues]

22:06.750 --> 22:09.875
Don't do it!
Look, we can work this out.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.083
[screams]

22:12.500 --> 22:15.417
Another voice for the choir.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.250
Another voice, plus
the two Lurkers you killed.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.833
No. More.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.667
And more.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.042
'And more.'

22:28.708 --> 22:30.083
'And more.'

22:31.708 --> 22:33.125
'And more.'

22:33.917 --> 22:37.167
Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.917
How many? How many?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.292
How many worlds are there?

22:43.042 --> 22:45.083
How many banquets?

22:45.167 --> 22:47.542
How many flowers
waiting to be harvested?

22:47.625 --> 22:51.833
How many new voices waiting
to be recruited into my choir?

22:53.625 --> 22:56.917
I had to keep adding voices
until the choir is big enough

22:57.042 --> 22:59.292
to sing me into heaven
when I die.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.625
It's necessary. Don't you see?

23:05.750 --> 23:10.042
The overture is just beginning,
Ms. Winters.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.375
Just beginning.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.833
[gasping]

23:16.625 --> 23:19.250
[breathing heavily]

23:19.333 --> 23:20.583
No.

23:21.583 --> 23:24.875
Stay. Stay for the symphony.

23:24.958 --> 23:25.833
Oh..

23:25.917 --> 23:28.042
We'll save a place for you.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.125
[instrumental music]

23:32.208 --> 23:33.625
Doctor,
I finished the follow-ups

23:33.708 --> 23:35.125
on those patients
you were asking for.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.083
Good, her daughter thinks

23:37.167 --> 23:38.500
that she's doing the right thing

23:38.583 --> 23:40.125
but if we show her
that people's conditions

23:40.208 --> 23:41.333
are actually getting worse

23:41.417 --> 23:43.667
because of the lack
of proper treatment..

23:46.083 --> 23:48.167
This can't be right.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.333
You're sure
these are the same patients

23:49.417 --> 23:50.458
that have been
going to see Rosen?

23:50.542 --> 23:52.333
Absolutely. Why?

23:54.250 --> 23:56.167
I'll be right back.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.000
(Mollari)
Sorry, fellas, but this is, uh

23:58.083 --> 24:00.000
I can just feel it,
this hand here.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.500
This is the one for..

24:01.583 --> 24:05.333
- Well, mm-hmm, u-huh.
- Interesting.

24:05.417 --> 24:08.292
Do you know that the odds
of this particular combination

24:08.375 --> 24:11.125
are 5000-to-1 against?

24:15.542 --> 24:17.333
- Uh..
- Uh..

24:17.417 --> 24:19.667
- Uh, Lennier.
- Yes, Londo?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.542
- Stop that.
- Ah.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.125
Does that mean I've won again?

24:23.208 --> 24:25.042
It means you have won a tenth

24:25.125 --> 24:27.750
of what you could have won
if you had..

24:29.958 --> 24:32.333
Never mind. Pick up your chips.

24:32.417 --> 24:35.375
Pay no attention to him.
He's from out of town.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.500
I believe it's my deal.

24:41.375 --> 24:44.458
(Laura)
'There. How is the pain?'

24:44.542 --> 24:48.750
Less. It doesn't hurt
to move my fingers.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.000
'It feels a little tingling,
though.'

24:52.083 --> 24:54.875
Oh, that's perfectly natural.
That will pass.

24:54.958 --> 24:56.542
[chuckles]

24:56.625 --> 24:59.208
'Now, if it isn't
completely gone'

24:59.292 --> 25:01.708
come back in a week,
and we'll see what we can do.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.750
- Oh, I will. Thank you.
- Alright, dear.

25:07.042 --> 25:08.333
[sighs]

25:11.417 --> 25:14.208
- Laura.
- Yes?

25:14.292 --> 25:15.708
It looks as though I was wrong.

25:15.792 --> 25:19.250
This device of yours
is more than what it seems.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.750
- I-it does heal, doesn't it?
- That's what I said, isn't it?

25:22.833 --> 25:25.000
Uh, would you please go away?

25:25.083 --> 25:28.667
- I am so tired.
- I would imagine so.

25:28.750 --> 25:31.333
I monitored your life signs
during the session.

25:31.417 --> 25:32.958
They dropped nearly 15%

25:33.042 --> 25:34.667
while you were hooked up
to this thing.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.000
It transfers energy
from one being to another.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.583
- Doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.583
You give up a little
of your life for someone else.

25:41.667 --> 25:45.000
I bought it from a trader
two years ago.

25:45.083 --> 25:48.792
He had no idea what it was,
neither did I.

25:48.875 --> 25:52.167
Took me months to figure out
how it works.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.875
It was designed as a means
of corporal punishment.

25:55.958 --> 26:00.458
Criminals who were sentenced
to death on different worlds

26:00.542 --> 26:03.083
had their life energy removed.

26:03.167 --> 26:05.667
And that energy was used
to heal others

26:05.750 --> 26:08.333
dying of terminal illness.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.708
But it doesn't have to be used
at full power.

26:10.792 --> 26:13.917
It can be used
a little at a time, to do good.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.125
Except for you.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.167
It's killing you by inches.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.417
You don't understand.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.792
I'm dying anyway.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.833
It's Lake's Syndrome.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.750
- Lake's Syndrome?
- Mm-hmm.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.958
- My God! The pain must be--
- Yes.

26:32.042 --> 26:36.042
I have two, maybe three years
left at the most.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.542
But that's time enough.

26:37.625 --> 26:40.000
If I can figure out
how this works

26:40.083 --> 26:43.000
then I can adjust it
so it needn't hurt

26:43.083 --> 26:45.000
the person
administering the treatment.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.458
Why did you lie to me
when you said

26:46.542 --> 26:48.167
you didn't know
what this thing did?

26:48.250 --> 26:50.292
Why did you let me think
that you were just a crank?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.625
Because telling you the truth

26:52.708 --> 26:56.000
would've meant telling Janice
how it affects me.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.750
She wouldn't understand.
She'd stop me.

27:00.417 --> 27:04.500
She loves me very much,
it seems. God knows why.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.250
Why don't you let me
take a look at it?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.375
I-I know some people
that might be able to help.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.542
Oh, no. No.

27:10.625 --> 27:14.458
Doctor, this has been my whole
life for the last two years.

27:14.542 --> 27:16.875
No, if-if there's a discovery
here to be made

27:16.958 --> 27:19.000
I will make it on my own terms.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.833
Doctor, this is my last chance
to do good.

27:21.917 --> 27:24.875
Please, let me finish
what I've started.

27:28.292 --> 27:29.708
Thank you.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.042
I-I'll make a deal with you.

27:32.125 --> 27:35.375
If anything should happen to me
before I finish

27:35.458 --> 27:38.125
the machine can go to you
and you can carry on.

27:38.208 --> 27:40.833
You'll find my notes
quite complete.

27:40.917 --> 27:42.792
On one condition.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.250
Janice is to know
nothing of this.

27:46.167 --> 27:47.792
Agreed?

27:47.875 --> 27:51.833
Alright, if you come to Medlab
once a week for exams.

27:51.917 --> 27:54.125
I wanna be able
to monitor your condition.

27:54.208 --> 27:56.083
And I reserve the right
to intervene

27:56.167 --> 27:58.292
if you start to push yourself
too far too fast.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.917
- Done.
- Once a week.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.208
- Starting on Monday.
- Yes.

28:08.167 --> 28:11.083
Until then...doctor.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.917
Harassing my mother again,
Dr. Franklin?

28:17.000 --> 28:19.750
Uh, no, just, uh

28:19.833 --> 28:21.583
checking in.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.292
She's a good woman, Janice.
You should be proud.

28:25.167 --> 28:26.833
I always have been.

28:26.917 --> 28:29.875
It's nice to hear
somebody else say it, though.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.875
Well, goodbye.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.208
Uh, listen.

28:34.292 --> 28:37.000
If you ever wanna
take a break, uh

28:37.083 --> 28:40.375
I'd love to buy you dinner
sometime.

28:40.458 --> 28:41.750
I don't know
what my mother told you

28:41.833 --> 28:44.625
but it must have
really been something.

28:44.708 --> 28:46.042
It was.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.083
Later.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.792
There you are.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.542
I was looking for you.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.833
- Finished with Mueller?
- Yes.

29:13.917 --> 29:16.000
I got a good look.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.375
Enough for a comparison scan
after he's been blanked.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.750
You can proceed
whenever you want.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.167
Thanks.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.292
Are you okay?

29:25.375 --> 29:28.333
No, not really.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.667
In the past five years
I have scanned minds

29:30.750 --> 29:33.125
that were so alien, so different

29:33.208 --> 29:34.500
that at times I was afraid

29:34.583 --> 29:37.083
I would never
find my way back out again.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.542
But at least those minds
held more humanity

29:39.625 --> 29:42.000
than what I saw
a few hours ago.

29:44.333 --> 29:48.042
The things that live inside us,
Mr. Garibaldi

29:48.125 --> 29:49.583
terrible things.

29:50.917 --> 29:52.250
Terrible.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.625
You said earlier
that you would bet good money

29:56.708 --> 29:58.792
that he had killed before.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.792
You would not have lost.

30:13.792 --> 30:16.000
In the fifth card and then..

30:17.458 --> 30:19.792
Oh, Great Maker.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.875
Alright, I'm in.
Bet's to my left.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.042
(male #3)
'I'm in for two.'

30:29.917 --> 30:32.500
[coughs]

30:32.583 --> 30:34.500
(male #4)
'I'll raise you three.'

30:34.583 --> 30:36.375
[coughs]

30:40.250 --> 30:41.583
(Lennier)
'Three.'

30:47.750 --> 30:49.833
I'll raise another three.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.500
[indistinct chatter]

30:57.875 --> 30:59.833
- Oh, is it to me?
- Yes.

30:59.917 --> 31:03.125
Um, I'll raise a red.

31:03.208 --> 31:04.958
Red. I have those.

31:05.042 --> 31:06.458
Yes, you do.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.792
It's time. Let's go.

31:13.875 --> 31:16.917
[intense music]

31:34.042 --> 31:36.542
- Going down, chief?
- Nah, heading up, Lou.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.292
[groaning]

31:38.375 --> 31:40.208
Go! Ah!

31:40.292 --> 31:41.917
Garibaldi to maintenance!
Head back to security.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.292
Work your way
down to the next level.

31:43.375 --> 31:44.708
This is a priority override.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.542
Kill transport tube
number seven, kill it now!

31:48.667 --> 31:51.708
[music continues]

31:52.375 --> 31:53.500
Ah!

31:53.583 --> 31:54.958
[beeping]

31:55.042 --> 31:57.667
[groaning]

32:01.750 --> 32:03.875
Alright, I'm in for the two.

32:05.542 --> 32:07.917
'Who are we waiting for
this time?'

32:10.083 --> 32:12.083
[clears throat]

32:12.167 --> 32:13.875
(male #4)
'It's two to you.'

32:15.458 --> 32:19.708
(Lennier)
'Two. You raised three.'

32:19.792 --> 32:21.917
And I'll raise three.

32:27.625 --> 32:29.375
[whimpering]

32:29.458 --> 32:32.000
Is it cold in here
or is it just me?

32:32.083 --> 32:35.167
Actually, the temperature
appears to be quite moderate.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.500
Hm.

32:44.292 --> 32:45.875
What the hell?

32:47.083 --> 32:48.625
- Ooh!
- You? You cheating?

32:48.708 --> 32:50.917
No, no, no. I'm sure
there's been a terrible mistake.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.542
Perhaps you and I can talk about
it quietly some other time.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.542
- You're cheating!
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.875
[grunting]

32:57.958 --> 32:59.958
[groaning]

33:01.375 --> 33:02.250
[grunting]

33:02.333 --> 33:05.250
- 'Ah!'
- 'Come on.'

33:05.333 --> 33:07.708
- I think we should leave now.
- A very good idea.

33:07.792 --> 33:11.333
- I'll just take my winnings.
- I think not. We'll go now.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.542
This is not good.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.917
[indistinct chatter]

33:20.875 --> 33:22.792
(Stephen)
'And what happened
to the prisoner?'

33:22.875 --> 33:24.167
Ah, he was hurt.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.625
A PPG flashed him
just before he jumped me.

33:26.708 --> 33:28.042
Looked like
it went right through his arm.

33:28.125 --> 33:29.958
Yeah, the flash
would've cauterized the wound

33:30.042 --> 33:32.792
but he still would've had damage
to the skin and the nerves.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.917
He's gonna need
medical attention fast.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.292
Well, if he comes here,
we'll take him.

33:36.375 --> 33:37.583
If he comes here.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.917
You say he got off
at a Downbelow sector?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.083
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.292
- Yes, doctor?
- Rose.

33:45.375 --> 33:47.417
If a man shows up down there
with a PPG wound

33:47.500 --> 33:48.708
you notify me immediately.

33:48.792 --> 33:50.083
Understood.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.250
At this point he'd be the only

33:51.333 --> 33:52.708
patient we've had all day.

33:52.792 --> 33:54.375
Word's getting out
about that quack

33:54.458 --> 33:55.625
'and her healing machine.'

33:55.708 --> 33:58.583
Look, she's not a..

33:58.667 --> 34:01.125
Tell Mr. Garibaldi
I'm going down to Brown 27-G.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.542
If he doesn't hear from me
in 20 minutes

34:02.625 --> 34:03.917
tell him to send in a team.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.292
(Lou)
'Will do.'

34:07.958 --> 34:10.042
Laura?

34:10.125 --> 34:12.333
Uh, Ms. Rosen,
it's Dr. Franklin.

34:13.542 --> 34:14.833
Laura?

34:17.792 --> 34:19.583
[door whirring]

34:21.375 --> 34:24.417
[dramatic music]

34:27.000 --> 34:28.375
Laura?

34:30.958 --> 34:32.708
Come in, doctor.

34:32.792 --> 34:35.458
You're just in time.
We're almost finished here.

34:38.417 --> 34:39.833
You alright, Laura?

34:39.917 --> 34:42.083
I'm fine. I'm just exhausted.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.417
Her treatment
is quite astonishing, doctor.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.625
Only 20 minutes and I've already
regained some use of my arm.

34:49.833 --> 34:51.167
Well, once the procedure
is finished

34:51.250 --> 34:53.000
it never hurts to have
a second opinion

34:53.083 --> 34:54.792
or a second hostage.

34:54.875 --> 34:57.292
You promised you'd let her go
if I helped you.

34:57.375 --> 35:00.750
It seems such a waste, though,
does it not?

35:00.833 --> 35:02.167
Then I refuse to continue.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.625
You will finish the job
or she dies now!

35:14.583 --> 35:16.250
Ah..

35:17.500 --> 35:18.708
Yes.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.583
Ah, yes.

35:22.667 --> 35:25.583
Yes, it's better. It's better.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.500
[gunshot]

35:28.583 --> 35:30.333
Stay.

35:30.417 --> 35:33.542
Or my next shot will not miss.

35:33.625 --> 35:36.583
He's right. He won't miss.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.875
We have no other choice.

35:40.958 --> 35:44.000
[intense music]

35:46.042 --> 35:48.625
[device humming]

35:48.708 --> 35:51.542
What are you..
What are you doing?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.625
Stop it or I'll..

35:54.667 --> 35:55.542
[groans]

35:55.625 --> 35:57.417
You'll do nothing.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.875
That pain you're feeling,
that agony

36:00.958 --> 36:03.833
that's Lake's Syndrome.

36:03.917 --> 36:07.458
A pain
almost too much to imagine.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.375
[mumbles]
Ah..

36:10.458 --> 36:14.333
Arthritis.
Your vision is blurred.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.917
Your intestines are on fire.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.250
'Your veins
are burning with pain.'

36:20.333 --> 36:24.083
You threatened me, you murderer.

36:24.167 --> 36:26.458
You threatened my daughter.

36:26.542 --> 36:29.208
'You'll never hurt anyone again.
Do you hear me?'

36:29.292 --> 36:30.500
Oh..

36:30.583 --> 36:32.875
You'll never hurt anyone again!

36:32.958 --> 36:35.250
[screaming]

36:39.500 --> 36:40.708
He's dead.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.458
This court has reviewed
all of the evidence

36:45.542 --> 36:48.583
provided by
the Office of Station Security.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.083
'It is the judgment
of this court'

36:50.167 --> 36:53.750
'that Laura Rosen
acted in self-defense'

36:53.833 --> 36:57.125
to protect her own life
as well as the lives of others.

36:57.208 --> 36:58.500
Therefore,
no charges will be pressed

36:58.583 --> 37:01.625
and she's free to leave
on her own recognizance

37:01.708 --> 37:05.375
provided that the alien device
used in this action

37:05.458 --> 37:07.625
is turned over
to station personnel

37:07.708 --> 37:09.333
so that it may be researched
more fully

37:09.417 --> 37:14.333
and to ensure that
it is not misused in the future.

37:14.417 --> 37:15.458
Court is adjourned.

37:15.542 --> 37:16.458
[gavel bangs]

37:16.542 --> 37:19.625
[indistinct chatter]

37:21.125 --> 37:22.708
Good luck.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.417
If it helps any,
you did the right thing.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.292
Thank you.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.250
Are you alright?

37:30.333 --> 37:32.833
I've taken a life..

37:32.917 --> 37:37.208
...in direct violation
of my oath as a doctor.

37:37.292 --> 37:41.708
I-I'm free of pain,
I'm free from Lake's Syndrome.

37:41.792 --> 37:46.083
They say I may live
another 20 or 30 years.

37:46.167 --> 37:49.833
But I do so
at the expense of a man's life.

37:49.917 --> 37:53.250
'No, doctor. I'm not alright.'

37:54.167 --> 37:56.000
I may never be alright again.

37:56.083 --> 37:59.083
You heard Mr. Garibaldi.
You did the right thing.

37:59.167 --> 38:00.750
Oh, darling.

38:01.708 --> 38:04.250
I did the necessary thing.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.792
That is not always the same
as the right thing.

38:10.042 --> 38:12.958
Now if you will excuse me,
I, uh

38:13.042 --> 38:15.417
I think I'd like to be alone
for a while.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.167
Well, Mr. Garibaldi,
there you are.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.208
I bring you glad tidings.

38:22.292 --> 38:23.625
Oh, good. I could use some.

38:23.708 --> 38:25.250
Remember that disturbance
you were telling me about

38:25.333 --> 38:26.917
at the Dark Star,
your team had to go in

38:27.000 --> 38:28.542
and break up a near riot?

38:28.625 --> 38:30.167
You had to arrest
thirty humans and aliens

38:30.250 --> 38:31.708
two of whom
refused to identify themselves.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.333
Yeah, I was just on my way
to look into it.

38:33.417 --> 38:35.375
- I've been a little busy.
- Well, I can save you the time.

38:35.458 --> 38:36.917
We've identified
the two culprits.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.083
Really? Who are they?

38:40.583 --> 38:42.083
'What?'

38:45.125 --> 38:47.542
I'm still waiting
for an explanation, gentlemen.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.292
Listen, I am prepared
to give you one, commander

38:50.375 --> 38:52.417
as soon as
the room stops spinning.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.708
This station creates gravity
by rotation.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.042
It never stops spinning.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.167
Well,
I begin to see my problem, hm.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.625
Mr. Lennier?

39:04.167 --> 39:05.583
The incident in question

39:05.667 --> 39:09.000
was completely
my responsibility, commander.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.583
I asked Ambassador Mollari
to help me learn

39:11.667 --> 39:15.083
about the parts of the station
I had not previously seen.

39:15.167 --> 39:19.208
I was unfamiliar with the rules
of conduct in these places

39:19.292 --> 39:21.875
and through error,
created offense

39:21.958 --> 39:25.708
and through offense,
created the incident.

39:25.792 --> 39:29.750
Ambassador, do you have anything
to add to this statement?

39:29.833 --> 39:32.917
No. No, not at this time.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.583
Diplomatic privilege
means you cannot be charged

39:35.667 --> 39:37.458
for the events that transpired.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.458
But I must insist on payment
of damages to the club.

39:40.542 --> 39:43.542
Yes, I agree.
Thank you, commander.

39:47.917 --> 39:49.542
Thank you, commander.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.000
[sighs]

39:58.750 --> 40:00.250
Why?

40:00.333 --> 40:02.167
In Minbari culture,
we are taught

40:02.250 --> 40:05.667
that it is an honor
to help another save face.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.750
- But Delenn--
- Will know better.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.583
But will not inquire
out of respect.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.375
Good day, ambassador.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.167
Lennier.

40:17.250 --> 40:20.000
[clears throat]
Thank you.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.333
If you ever need anything
from me..

40:24.208 --> 40:26.667
There-there is one thing.

40:26.750 --> 40:29.000
When we were
at the gaming table

40:29.083 --> 40:30.875
somehow..

40:30.958 --> 40:34.375
...a part of you
reached out for the cards.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.000
Yes? Yes?

40:36.083 --> 40:37.667
What was that?

40:38.833 --> 40:40.042
Uh..

40:43.417 --> 40:46.417
[indistinct whispering]

40:49.250 --> 40:51.375
Yes, it's true.

40:51.458 --> 40:55.167
Yes, here, Li.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.708
Goddess of passion.

40:56.792 --> 41:01.042
A synthesis
of male and female Centauri.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.000
Did you think
these were just decorations?

41:06.125 --> 41:07.875
I'm going to take
a vow of silence

41:07.958 --> 41:10.542
concerning
this entire conversation.

41:10.625 --> 41:11.583
[chuckles]

41:11.667 --> 41:13.875
- Good day.
- Good day.

41:15.042 --> 41:17.750
[door whirring]

41:17.833 --> 41:18.875
[sighs]

41:18.958 --> 41:21.083
They are a strange people..

41:21.917 --> 41:24.000
...but they are okay.

41:24.083 --> 41:27.125
[instrumental music]

41:32.583 --> 41:34.208
There you are, doctor. Hm.

41:34.292 --> 41:37.792
I trust you'll put it
to better use than I did.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.958
Well, the first thing
is to study it

41:40.042 --> 41:42.167
and find out
how and why it works.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.833
And who knows,
it might be able to preserve

41:43.917 --> 41:46.875
someone's life
when nothing else works.

41:46.958 --> 41:49.417
Volunteers who can donate
a little life energy

41:49.500 --> 41:51.542
the way
people used to donate blood

41:51.625 --> 41:53.042
before synthetics
were perfected.

41:53.125 --> 41:55.417
You hear that? He's a dreamer.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.750
- 'What's wrong with that?'
- Nothing, nothing at all.

41:58.833 --> 42:03.083
But try to make sure he doesn't
wake up before I get back.

42:03.167 --> 42:05.542
- Get back?
- Yes.

42:05.625 --> 42:07.458
Through no desire of my own

42:07.542 --> 42:10.833
I have been granted
a second lease on life.

42:10.917 --> 42:14.250
Somewhere out there
is what I need to redeem myself.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.875
- You don't need to--
- Yes, I do.

42:16.958 --> 42:19.583
And I'm going to find it.
I'm all packed.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.792
My cruiser leaves
in half an hour.

42:23.208 --> 42:28.000
I am.. I-I would ask you
to look after my daughter.

42:28.083 --> 42:31.458
But my instincts tell me
that won't be a problem.

42:34.875 --> 42:37.125
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, Laura.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.667
And for what it's worth

42:38.750 --> 42:40.625
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.042
Thank you.

42:46.208 --> 42:47.792
Is that dinner invitation
still open?

42:47.875 --> 42:50.750
Yeah. Yeah, it's still open.

42:51.625 --> 42:53.000
7:00? Zocalo?

42:53.083 --> 42:56.167
[instrumental music]

43:08.417 --> 43:10.792
[instrumental music]

43:37.375 --> 43:40.417
[music continues]
