00:02.290 --> 00:04.170
You thought you could get
married with a fake ID?

00:04.210 --> 00:06.150
I did get married with a fake ID.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.870
I still can't believe
you're my girlfriend.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.790
I still can't believe
you're my boyfriend.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.290
What happened with Jack?

00:11.320 --> 00:12.990
He falsely confessed
to making the IDs for you

00:13.030 --> 00:14.760
and everyone else.???

00:14.790 --> 00:15.960
Did you get married?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.880
Yeah,that's where I was.

00:17.910 --> 00:18.820
-Hi.
- Hey.

00:18.850 --> 00:20.380
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.440
Unless I,uh,sell fake IDs again.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.200
I got community service and
nothing on my permanent record.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.710
Just to be clear,I'm in love
with Grace Bowman.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.980
I'd rather be the one you cheat with

00:30.010 --> 00:31.780
than the one you cheat on.

00:31.810 --> 00:34.100
But,Mom,I can't find a job.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.990
And I don't know anything
about having a baby.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.590
Did you really think getting
married would solve anything?

00:39.630 --> 00:41.130
Kind of,yeah.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.940
You either get a job,go to school

00:42.970 --> 00:44.630
and get someone
to help with child care,

00:44.680 --> 00:46.600
or you think about adoption.

00:46.650 --> 00:48.030
I think the baby agrees with you.

00:48.070 --> 00:50.490
Mom,it's moving. It's really moving.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.570
It's supposed to move.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.380
Mom,I don't think I can do this.

00:53.410 --> 00:55.260
You can do this,Amy.

01:01.130 --> 01:02.580
I'm coming,I'm coming.

01:02.610 --> 01:03.820
Jeez,where is everyone?

01:03.850 --> 01:05.750
???We were having a discussion.
I'll open the door.

01:05.770 --> 01:06.730
I'll open the door.

01:06.770 --> 01:07.880
You don't live here anymore.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.670
I live here,all right.
This house is mine.

01:09.710 --> 01:10.670
Half yours.

01:10.710 --> 01:12.020
The garage is not half.

01:12.050 --> 01:13.270
I'll buy your half.

01:13.305 --> 01:15.420
- With what?
- With whatever money you're hiding.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.770
Half of which is mine.
I know you're hiding money,George.

01:17.810 --> 01:18.800
We're broke.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.520
I know you moved the savings.

01:20.550 --> 01:22.110
There's nothing left in savings.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.340
???There's someone at the door.

01:27.860 --> 01:29.030
Hello.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.170
Reverend Stone.

01:31.210 --> 01:33.000
Oh,good Lord. Now I recognize you.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.470
We don't want whatever you're selling.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.340
- Good night.
- Excuse me.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.730
Um,I'm sorry.I'm afraid that
you caught us at a bad time.

01:39.770 --> 01:42.130
Would there be a better time
when I could come back?

01:42.170 --> 01:43.020
Not really.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.610
I just wanted to introduce myself.

01:44.650 --> 01:46.840
Your daughter goes
to school with my son Jack.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.920
How are you,Amy?

01:47.970 --> 01:50.380
I'm fine,except for the fact
that I'm having the devil's baby

01:50.430 --> 01:52.030
and I'm in love with Ben.

01:52.450 --> 01:53.520
Ashley.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.020
Well done.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.790
Is there maybe a card
that you can give me?

01:57.820 --> 01:59.950
I promise I'll call
if I need any help.

02:00.010 --> 02:01.130
Sure.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.740
But if I could come in,
I just wanted--

02:02.770 --> 02:03.830
Not tonight.

02:03.870 --> 02:04.680
Got it.

02:04.730 --> 02:06.370
Well,thanks for taking my card.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.000
And if I can help in any way,
please give me a call.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.150
- Thank you.
- Yeah,yeah,yeah.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.720
-I'm available--
- That's terrific.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.230
Don't be rude to people.

02:14.270 --> 02:15.790
It teaches her the wrong thing.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.130
Don't lecture me in front of her.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.790
That teaches her the wrong thing too.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.670
You know she gets all
that sarcasm from you.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.480
Thank you. But I believe
it's generally referred to as wit.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.430
Yeah,half-wit.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.670
I want a word with you.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.400
I'm here to serve.

03:00.490 --> 03:02.330
So,uh,do you want a beer?

03:02.360 --> 03:04.680
Oh,uh,no,thank you,Amy.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.860
Haven't touched the stuff in years.

03:06.890 --> 03:09.230
I'm actually not Amy.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.290
I lied. I'm Ashley,
I'm her sister and I'm 13.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.390
So now...

03:16.430 --> 03:17.450
You're pregnant?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.280
Oh,no,Amy's the pregnant one.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.210
Ah,much better.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.550
Not much better.

03:21.580 --> 03:22.570
She's 15.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.430
Well,that's better than 13 and 12 and 11.

03:25.470 --> 03:27.110
You have to look on
the bright side of life.

03:27.150 --> 03:29.600
Yeah,right,the bright side of life.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.630
You and Brian.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.540
The Life of Brian.

03:33.570 --> 03:34.960
You saw that movie?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.070
Isn't that a funny movie?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.260
You saw that movie?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.540
Changed my life.

03:38.580 --> 03:39.500
How?

03:39.540 --> 03:41.350
Well,it's a long story.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.930
Short story is I was high
on drugs,rented it,sobered up

03:44.970 --> 03:46.740
and became a messenger of good news.

03:46.790 --> 03:48.320
Are you a licensed minister?

03:48.350 --> 03:49.430
I am.

03:49.470 --> 03:50.910
You still on drugs?

03:50.930 --> 03:51.930
I am not.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.830
You just seem like you might be.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.490
I'm just a happy guy.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.720
I met your son Jack at
my sister's fake wedding.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.520
I know all about that wedding.
The fake IDs,everything.

04:01.550 --> 04:02.720
That's why I dropped by.

04:02.750 --> 04:03.670
Why?

04:03.720 --> 04:04.960
To see if there's anything I could do.

04:05.000 --> 04:05.760
Like what?

04:05.810 --> 04:07.670
I don't know. I never know.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.450
I just go and ask if there's anything
I can do to make the situation better.

04:11.490 --> 04:13.120
And if there is and
I can do it,I do it.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.250
You're not quite
what I was expecting.

04:15.790 --> 04:16.990
Well,like they always say,

04:17.019 --> 04:19.170
no expectations,no disappointments.

04:19.209 --> 04:21.110
Jack's kind of a serious guy.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.190
You don't seem all that serious.

04:23.220 --> 04:25.200
And you're in
a very serious business.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.730
Jack's my stepson.

04:27.170 --> 04:28.460
He's a good guy,Jack.

04:28.490 --> 04:29.860
I heard you asked him
to ask out Grace

04:29.900 --> 04:31.410
so you could keep
her dad at your church

04:31.440 --> 04:33.310
and keep his money at your church.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.940
That's not quite true.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.760
I did ask Jack to ask her out
under that pretense,yes.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.050
Very good,Ashley.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.620
Happy to clear the air on that one.

04:40.650 --> 04:43.180
Jack did take her out as a favor to me,

04:43.220 --> 04:47.090
but he really likes
that girl,or liked that girl.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.390
So,um,his parents are divorced?

04:50.430 --> 04:52.290
No,his father is deceased.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.510
I met his mother when she and
I were in grief counseling.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.550
You were counseling Jack's mother

04:57.590 --> 04:59.910
over the death of her husband
and you picked her up?

04:59.940 --> 05:03.000
I love your mind,the way you
question everything. Marvelous.

05:03.050 --> 05:06.500
No,I was in counseling
and,uh,so was she.

05:06.530 --> 05:10.030
So your wife is deceased?

05:10.070 --> 05:11.160
No,my son.

05:11.190 --> 05:12.440
Oh,I'm so sorry.

05:12.470 --> 05:13.660
So am I.

05:14.070 --> 05:16.200
He was a wonderful boy.
And when he died...

05:16.240 --> 05:18.120
Well,my wife and I got divorced.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.510
But that was mostly my fault,

05:19.550 --> 05:22.760
because I turned with great
enthusiasm to,uh--

05:22.800 --> 05:24.150
The drugs you mentioned.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.110
You do pay attention to the details.

05:26.140 --> 05:28.160
That's a wonderful trait.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.650
Yes,the drugs.

05:29.670 --> 05:30.750
But I gotta tell you,

05:30.780 --> 05:33.730
living clean and sober with
a woman I'm in love with,

05:34.540 --> 05:36.270
doing work I love each day.

05:36.310 --> 05:37.744
Doesn't get much better than that.

05:37.744 --> 05:39.560
Unless you get
it right the first time,

05:39.610 --> 05:42.560
without the drugs and
the death and the divorce,

05:43.070 --> 05:45.020
and still appreciate life this much.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.270
I don't want my parents
to get divorced.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.840
So that's what you can do for me.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.090
You can make sure that
my parents don't get divorced.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.990
They seem unhappy.
Couldn't help but notice.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.800
But I think they think
that if they get divorced,

05:57.830 --> 05:58.990
they're gonna be a lot happier.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.390
Yeah,but I won't.

06:00.430 --> 06:03.450
Well,I'll do what I can.

06:12.790 --> 06:13.740
Hello?

06:13.770 --> 06:15.160
Oh,hello. Uh,how are you?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.410
Is this the Bowman residence?
Dr. Bowman?

06:17.450 --> 06:19.430
Yes,but he's not here.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.700
Call his service.

06:20.730 --> 06:23.430
Okay,I'm a friend of Ricky's,
and I was trying to find him.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.070
I thought he might be there.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.660
I know he and Grace are going out.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.250
You have any idea where he might be?

06:28.290 --> 06:29.680
He is not here.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.530
He was. Now he's not.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.740
Okay,uh,do you know where he went?

06:34.790 --> 06:37.100
He took Grace to the batting cages.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.620
They're going to hit baseballs.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.520
That was easy. Okay,
thank you very much.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.580
Why are you sitting here
with the garage door open?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.230
It's not like
the neighbors don't know.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.310
Where's Dad?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.090
Oh,they're inside arguing
about money. Again.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.130
I cannot stand all this
talk about money

07:02.160 --> 07:04.710
and not having money
and needing money and--

07:04.740 --> 07:05.770
It's just so common.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.800
Common. Hm.

07:07.830 --> 07:10.000
How much did you earn at your
babysitting gig tonight,

07:10.030 --> 07:11.090
Your Majesty?

07:11.120 --> 07:13.750
Twenty bucks. Shut up.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.840
How much does it cost to have a baby?

07:17.350 --> 07:20.210
I don't know. Thousands,I guess.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.710
How many thousands?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.870
I don't know.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.730
Two,10,20?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.150
A lifetime full of
babysitting multiple children

07:27.190 --> 07:29.000
of rich and desperate parents.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.600
Well,Amy,you know,
if something goes wrong,

07:30.640 --> 07:32.690
it can cost more than 100,000.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.550
What? Yeah,that's what
Mom said to Dad tonight.

07:35.590 --> 07:37.970
And he said that she has to get a job

07:38.010 --> 07:40.660
because he's already working
as hard as he can

07:40.700 --> 07:42.220
and we're already going broke.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.570
And she says that
he's hiding all of his money

07:45.600 --> 07:47.340
so he won't have to pay
her in the divorce.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.310
I am so happy that I missed that.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.220
Well,there's nothing
that's gonna happen to my baby.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.520
My baby's fine. That's what
the doctor says anyway.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.600
And I'm looking for
a job with insurance,

07:56.630 --> 07:58.650
but nobody wants to hire me.

07:58.690 --> 08:00.790
Who wants to hire a pregnant teenager?

08:01.790 --> 08:02.670
No one.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.600
Again,shut up.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.050
Maybe I could start my own business.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.470
Doing what?

08:08.500 --> 08:10.230
I don't know. Just some business.

08:10.270 --> 08:13.200
How are you gonna start some
business without some money?

08:14.030 --> 08:15.410
Yeah,I know. Shut up.

08:15.450 --> 08:17.540
Oh,Ashley. What am I gonna do?

08:17.570 --> 08:19.620
How am I gonna financially
support a child

08:19.660 --> 08:21.590
and raise a child without Ben's help?

08:21.620 --> 08:23.910
Can't that stupid Ricky guy get a job?

08:24.340 --> 08:26.930
I mean,he's 16 and he's not pregnant.

08:35.530 --> 08:36.710
I love you.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.130
I love you too.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.110
How was babysitting?

08:39.140 --> 08:40.789
Well,I made 20 whole dollars.

08:40.820 --> 08:41.820
That's great.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.840
I mean,for babysitting,wow.

08:43.870 --> 08:46.590
I'm just excited that you got
a chance to earn some money.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.080
My dad says it's always easier
to get a job if you have a job.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.380
Yeah,maybe.

08:51.770 --> 08:55.010
Hey,um,I was thinking about something
and I thought I'd run it past you.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.360
- Shoot.
- I was wondering...

08:57.390 --> 08:59.140
What would you think about me calling Ricky

08:59.170 --> 09:02.280
and asking if he was planning
on financially helping out with the baby?

09:02.310 --> 09:03.380
Come on.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.600
Well,I mean,it would take
some pressure off of me.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.850
Kind of.

09:07.290 --> 09:09.470
- Okay,it was just an idea.
- A bad idea.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.810
Well,it's only fair of him
to help with the baby.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.740
I don't want you to have
anything to do with that guy.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.140
Especially considering
what we know about him.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.800
I'm getting a job,okay?

09:17.830 --> 09:20.310
It's not your responsibility
to get a job,

09:20.340 --> 09:23.430
and you haven't gotten a job
and neither have I.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.830
And it's his responsibility
to help out with the baby.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.900
Well,I'm making it my responsibility.

09:27.940 --> 09:28.940
You can't.

09:28.980 --> 09:31.120
Amy,if we were legally married right now,

09:31.170 --> 09:33.030
would you be asking me these questions?

09:33.050 --> 09:35.160
But we're not legally married.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.570
Technically.

09:36.990 --> 09:40.310
And technically that's not my baby,but--

09:40.330 --> 09:43.010
- Ben.
- Listen,just don't panic,okay?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.850
We'll figure it out. And together.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.650
And without Ricky.

09:47.100 --> 09:48.130
Everything will be fine.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.920
All right,well,I should go.

09:50.950 --> 09:51.660
Night.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.060
Good night.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.200
Wow.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.140
Money seems to cause a lot
of stress,doesn't it?

10:01.190 --> 10:03.430
Or the lack of it,anyway.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.700
Don't worry about it.
I'll get a job and I'll help.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.960
How are you gonna get a job
if I can't get a job?

10:08.990 --> 10:12.080
I don't know. I haven't tried,
but it doesn't look too hard.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.350
Well,it is.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.090
Whoa. Someone's been watching us.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.660
I know. He was there when I got home.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.780
Let's go inside now.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.770
How you doing?
Um,I was just wondering--

10:26.800 --> 10:28.650
Look,this isn't a garage sale,okay?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.430
Oh. What is it?

10:30.470 --> 10:32.190
-Who are you? 
-Are you Amy?

10:32.220 --> 10:34.590
I'm Bob. Underwood.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.360
Ricky's dad.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.530
Don't m-m-m-move.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.270
Jack.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.530
Thanks for coming.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.760
Yeah,of course.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.500
Is everyone okay?
What's the emergency?

10:58.140 --> 11:00.030
Yeah. I need a ride.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.260
I need to go to the batting cages.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.480
That's the emergency?

11:04.510 --> 11:06.040
I have to get there now.

11:06.070 --> 11:09.160
I made a mistake. A big mistake.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.480
What kind of a mistake?

11:10.530 --> 11:16.830
I answered the phone
because my parents are not here.

11:17.280 --> 11:22.310
I was hoping it was Tammy,
but it wasn't.

11:22.350 --> 11:25.890
It was a strange man
who asked for Ricky.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.400
Okay. So a strange man
asked for Ricky. And...?

11:28.440 --> 11:31.770
And I told him he's not here

11:31.800 --> 11:36.100
and he is with Grace at
the batting cages.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.020
All right,maybe you shouldn't
have told him that,

11:38.050 --> 11:40.360
but it's okay.
Everyone makes a mistake,Tom.

11:40.390 --> 11:42.650
He laughed at me.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.000
He was a bad man,I can tell.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.330
I tried to call Ricky.

11:48.370 --> 11:51.170
He won't answer his phone.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.410
And Grace won't answer
her phone either.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.890
If they're at the cages,
their phones are probably off.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.200
No kidding. Let's go.

11:59.230 --> 12:00.420
Tom,maybe it was his stepfather

12:00.460 --> 12:02.300
just trying to find out
where Ricky is.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.690
If we go to the batting cages,
Grace is gonna think

12:05.710 --> 12:07.850
I showed up there because that's
where she and Ricky are.

12:07.870 --> 12:11.450
Just like she did at the wedding
when I was invited and Ricky wasn't,

12:11.480 --> 12:14.050
even though he just heard
about it and showed up.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.620
Yeah,okay,big deal.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.850
It is a big deal.
People think I'm crazy.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.200
They think I can't leave
Grace alone. But I can.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.780
I really can.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.560
I'm starting to look like a stalker.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.590
Would you stop worrying
what people think of you?

12:29.620 --> 12:31.820
People could get hurt here.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.450
Let's go.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.150
I didn't mean to scare your daughters.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.800
I just wanted to introduce myself

12:41.830 --> 12:44.240
and tell you that I'm--
I'm here to help in any way I can.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.310
Because I know Ricky won't.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.200
And how do you know that?

12:47.230 --> 12:48.190
Because I know my son.

12:48.220 --> 12:50.890
And even if he says
he might step up,believe me,

12:50.920 --> 12:52.780
he's not a step-up kind of guy.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.630
Ricky's a liar. A big liar.

12:54.670 --> 12:57.150
Well,how did the big liar
end up in foster care?

12:57.180 --> 12:58.490
Why doesn't he live with you?

12:58.520 --> 13:00.310
Well,because when
I tried to lay down the law,

13:00.340 --> 13:01.680
he made up lies about me.

13:01.730 --> 13:02.690
Big lies.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.990
And that's how he got into foster care.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.810
And now his new mommy and daddy
believe everything he says.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.720
They've got him
in therapy with a therapist

13:08.760 --> 13:10.960
who probably believes
everything he says.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.250
And I'd like to know
what his therapist has to say

13:14.280 --> 13:16.030
about what he did to your Amy.

13:16.710 --> 13:20.390
But,you know,he probably
told him he was seduced.

13:20.430 --> 13:23.110
Really,you don't know him
the way I do. Nobody does.

13:23.140 --> 13:24.620
That kid blames his life on everybody

13:24.660 --> 13:27.570
but the person responsible
for it: him.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.700
And he's been getting in
trouble his whole life,

13:30.730 --> 13:32.270
and he just lies his way out of it.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.150
Well,he can't lie
his way out of this one.

13:34.190 --> 13:35.190
It's too late for that.

13:35.230 --> 13:37.630
I'm really sorry. I really am.

13:39.730 --> 13:41.100
Oh,man,this is...

13:42.150 --> 13:45.280
It's so hard,you know?
He's my son and I love him.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.260
So despite the fact

13:47.290 --> 13:48.890
that he makes all these
problems for people,

13:48.930 --> 13:50.890
including myself,by the way,

13:50.920 --> 13:53.950
I just feel like I have to do
what I can to help the people he's hurt.

13:53.990 --> 13:56.660
Because like it or not,
he's my son,you know?

13:56.690 --> 13:58.510
So I-- I just wanted to
introduce myself

13:58.550 --> 14:00.720
and tell you that,you know,
I'm-- I'm around.

14:00.750 --> 14:04.090
And if-- If there's anything I can do
to help,even if it's just financially...

14:05.530 --> 14:06.310
Financially?

14:06.340 --> 14:08.750
Well,yeah,financially.
I mean,this is gonna cost money.

14:08.790 --> 14:10.020
So just let me know.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.670
Give me your card. You have a card?

14:11.710 --> 14:14.570
I-- I don't. Um-- Um,
I wrote my number down here,though.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.890
Just give me a call anytime
if there's anything I can do.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.850
And I really appreciate
you hearing me out,George.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.970
Yeah. Night,Bob.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.160
He's the liar,not Ricky.

14:28.190 --> 14:30.320
How's that?
I think we better get Mom.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.960
I know some things about Ricky
that I should tell you.

14:33.940 --> 14:34.950
The two of you.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.620
What don't we know now?

14:48.190 --> 14:49.420
All right.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.540
And then you just follow
through like that.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.320
Okay,like--? Like this?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.370
Yeah,just like that.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.580
Okay,I think I got it.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.090
- You sure?
- Mm-hm. I'm sure.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.690
- You got it?
- I got it.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.350
I'm gonna put this on
the slowest pitch possible,okay?

15:03.380 --> 15:04.510
Okay.

15:11.770 --> 15:12.950
It's not gonna hit you.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.910
They're so fast.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.440
What's going on?

15:33.470 --> 15:35.030
I'm at the batting cages.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.020
What's all that screaming?

15:38.040 --> 15:40.080
It's Grace. She's afraid of baseballs.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.020
Ugh,she's afraid of everything.

15:42.350 --> 15:43.870
Hadn't you better go rescue her?

15:43.910 --> 15:45.290
Yeah,I will. Eventually.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.210
Wow,you are so low,you know that?

15:48.240 --> 15:50.600
You're scaring her so
she can get closer to you.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.470
Hey,you are smart.
That's why you're so sexy.

15:53.510 --> 15:55.560
But maybe Grace is smart too.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.500
Maybe she's just
pretending to be scared

15:57.540 --> 15:59.270
so she can get next to me.

15:59.300 --> 16:01.810
Or she thinks screaming
is cute or something.

16:03.660 --> 16:04.960
It is cute.

16:04.990 --> 16:06.770
And slightly irritating.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.250
Are you coming over later?

16:11.280 --> 16:14.770
Depends on how scared and
how close Grace gets,I guess.

16:14.810 --> 16:16.990
- Good night.
- Wait,I was just joking.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.450
- I'll be there.
- When?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.700
When I get there.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.340
It won't be late.
It's a school night.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.920
See you. Hey,and bring me
something to eat.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.520
You got Grace into a batting cage?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.040
She must be in love.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.310
Yeah,I guess so.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.460
Did you just come by to see
if she's okay?

16:31.800 --> 16:32.480
She's okay.

16:32.510 --> 16:34.920
No,he came down here for me.

16:34.950 --> 16:37.640
Tom,you can't keep coming on
dates with me and your sister.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.950
Last time you came on a date with us,

16:38.970 --> 16:41.420
we all got in trouble because
you decided to get married.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.680
Yeah,still working on that.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.140
Good,I like Tammy.

16:45.180 --> 16:46.820
So,what are you doing here with Jack?

16:46.850 --> 16:49.340
Look,I made a mistake.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.220
Someone called and asked
Tom where you were.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.900
He told him you were here with Grace.

16:52.930 --> 16:56.360
I tried to call you and
I tried to tell you.

16:57.010 --> 16:58.350
You didn't pick up.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.790
Well,I had my phone off. Besides
,who can hear over that?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.460
I'm sorry.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.190
I wish I had said nothing.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.280
So a guy called your house
looking for me?

17:09.260 --> 17:10.650
- What guy?
- A bad guy.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.609
Or Tom thinks he's a bad guy anyway.

17:12.660 --> 17:14.460
He asked me to drive him here
so he could tell you.

17:14.490 --> 17:16.410
A bad guy is looking for me?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.220
I don't know any bad guys.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.490
But if I did know a bad guy,

17:19.520 --> 17:21.069
he'd have my number
and he'd call me.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.660
I am telling you the truth.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.480
He asked me to bring him,
I brought him.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.400
Well,as you can both see,
there aren't any bad guys.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.870
So you can leave now.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.810
You should be ashamed
of yourself for using Tom.

17:36.650 --> 17:37.580
Hey,you're doing great.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.290
I almost hit that one.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.770
Here,let me show you how it's done.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.110
Just what I thought.
He didn't believe us.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.980
But a bad guy is looking for him.

17:46.010 --> 17:47.390
I believe you.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.960
Oh,great. Here she comes.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.700
She's not gonna believe us either.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.070
Okay,you two cannot show up on
every date I have with Ricky.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.360
We're here to hit some balls.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.530
No,you're not.

18:01.570 --> 18:03.170
Go home. You too,Tom.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.980
No. We're here to hit some balls.

18:14.710 --> 18:16.420
And you found out about this when?

18:16.460 --> 18:18.540
Lauren told me a couple weeks ago.

18:18.570 --> 18:20.130
And you didn't tell anyone?

18:20.170 --> 18:22.120
Well,I told Ben. But I didn't
think I should tell anyone else.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.210
It's personal information.
Very personal.

18:25.230 --> 18:25.930
No,it is.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.560
And I wouldn't want you to go
spreading this around school.

18:29.590 --> 18:32.190
Well,it does make things
a little bit more complicated.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.300
Wait,too personal
to talk about with me?

18:35.800 --> 18:38.590
I thought we were gonna have
a more open relationship.

18:38.630 --> 18:41.250
That we were gonna try to have
a more honest relationship.

18:41.290 --> 18:42.820
Maybe Ricky is lying.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.280
George,children do not lie
about being sexually abused.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.150
He's not a child,he's 16.
He's almost grown.

18:48.190 --> 18:49.660
We all know he's a liar.

18:49.700 --> 18:50.790
What are you,a psychiatrist?

18:50.820 --> 18:52.120
How do you know anything about this?

18:52.170 --> 18:54.420
Any idiot knows that
a children do not lie

18:54.450 --> 18:56.150
about being sexually molested.

18:56.190 --> 18:59.020
Dad,Ricky goes to Lauren's father,

18:59.080 --> 19:01.120
so I think it's true.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.970
And,besides,that Bob guy kind
of gave me the creeps.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.220
Oh,but Ricky doesn't?

19:05.260 --> 19:06.820
If this is who Ricky's father is--

19:06.850 --> 19:07.990
We don't know this is who he is.

19:08.030 --> 19:09.640
We don't know anything yet.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.960
Okay,George,
maybe we don't know anything,

19:12.000 --> 19:13.990
but if this is
who Ricky's father is

19:14.020 --> 19:15.850
and if Ricky,
through no fault of his own,

19:15.890 --> 19:18.840
is dealing with who his father
is and what he did to him,

19:18.870 --> 19:23.470
then,Amy,do you really think that this is
the best family to create for your child?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.960
Or wouldn't it be better
to find a more stable family?

19:25.990 --> 19:28.240
Two responsible adults who want a child,

19:28.270 --> 19:31.610
who can afford a child and--
And who can take care of a child?

19:31.650 --> 19:34.420
I don't know,Mom. I really don't.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.080
But I have been thinking about it

19:36.120 --> 19:39.280
and about everything else
that you've said.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.570
So call someone.

19:44.370 --> 19:46.810
Call whoever you call
to get a baby adopted.

19:48.940 --> 19:50.600
- Amy.
- Mom.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.560
I really can't talk about
this right now.

19:59.190 --> 20:01.890
I'm not so sure we should have
our grandchild adopted.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.700
That's all I'm gonna say about it.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.930
What happened to,"Who is it?"

20:32.950 --> 20:33.860
I don't know.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.830
What happened to calling
before you just show up?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.180
Well,if I call first,
then you'll know I'm coming over.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.670
May I come in?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.760
I'm studying for a test.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.320
Well,take a break.

20:43.350 --> 20:44.570
Have you eaten?

20:46.880 --> 20:48.530
Come on. Have something to eat.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.230
I just got out of court. I'm starving.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.740
I'm expecting someone,okay?

20:52.770 --> 20:53.940
I have a date.

20:53.980 --> 20:55.260
A date?

20:55.290 --> 20:57.710
It's almost 9:00. I thought you
had to study for a test.

20:57.740 --> 21:00.140
I do,but I studied already

21:00.180 --> 21:03.960
and it sounded a lot better than
saying I was expecting someone.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.160
And besides,I'm angry with you.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.570
Angry with me? What did I do?

21:07.610 --> 21:11.040
Um,you got Jack into trouble
over those stupid fake IDs.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.740
No,Jack got Jack into trouble
over those stupid fake IDs.

21:14.780 --> 21:16.160
I didn't get him in trouble.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.860
It's serious business since 9/11,
making fake IDs.

21:20.950 --> 21:23.220
You and your friends shouldn't
be fooling around with those.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.010
I'll be right back.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.990
Where are you going,to call Ricky?

21:28.460 --> 21:30.740
Adrian,what do you know
about this guy really,

21:30.780 --> 21:32.520
other than you like
the way he looks?

21:32.570 --> 21:35.300
I know a lot,okay?

21:35.680 --> 21:37.160
And he's just a friend.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.750
He's out with Grace.
She has to be home early.

21:40.790 --> 21:44.080
He doesn't wanna be home early,
so he's coming by here.

21:44.110 --> 21:46.200
- Nice guy.
- He is a nice guy.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.070
Yeah? What's nice about him?

21:48.110 --> 21:49.270
Plenty.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.370
Okay,what's not nice about him?

21:51.660 --> 21:53.350
And I know you know something.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.160
You found out something.

21:55.190 --> 21:58.270
With all your digging around
about the fake IDs,

21:58.310 --> 22:00.430
you found out something,
didn't you?

22:00.460 --> 22:02.680
- I might have.
- Are you gonna tell me?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.890
I'm gonna tell you
what I can tell you.

22:05.230 --> 22:06.510
Okay.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.590
But I already know he's
with a foster family,

22:08.620 --> 22:10.140
if that's what you're gonna tell me.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.360
And I know why.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.410
Ricky told me.

22:12.450 --> 22:13.830
What did he tell you?

22:13.860 --> 22:17.260
That his parents were drug addicts.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.610
His mother's still on the street

22:18.640 --> 22:20.010
and his father's in prison.

22:20.060 --> 22:23.330
His father's not in prison. He's on parole.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.570
And I'm pretty sure he's gonna
be trying to find Ricky,

22:26.630 --> 22:29.470
since Ricky sent him to prison.

22:30.210 --> 22:33.150
Well,did Ricky do anything?

22:33.190 --> 22:36.770
Has he ever committed a crime?
Has he ever been arrested?

22:36.800 --> 22:38.370
Not that I know of,

22:38.410 --> 22:40.880
but that doesn't mean he's not
dangerous to be around.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.210
His father will find him.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.680
Don't let him find him here,okay?

22:46.710 --> 22:50.460
Just stay away from him
for a while,Adrian.

22:50.510 --> 22:53.080
You can stay away from him
for a while,right?

22:53.120 --> 22:56.770
Okay,just because his father
was in prison and a drug addict

22:56.800 --> 22:59.050
doesn't mean Ricky's a bad guy.

22:59.090 --> 23:00.950
And he doesn't do drugs.

23:00.990 --> 23:02.930
I would know if he did drugs.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.020
You're absolutely right.

23:05.060 --> 23:08.230
Children of parents who are
in prison are not bad children

23:08.270 --> 23:10.960
and it doesn't mean they'll
turn out to be bad adults.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.680
It doesn't mean anything other than

23:12.710 --> 23:14.910
their parents chose to commit
a crime or crimes

23:14.950 --> 23:18.350
for which they were arrested,
tried and found guilty of committing.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.670
The children of parents behind
bars generally suffer

23:20.710 --> 23:23.630
for no other reason other
than their parents are selfish.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.640
So why is Ricky dangerous?

23:25.680 --> 23:26.940
That's just my opinion.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.000
is it?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.160
Why?

23:29.200 --> 23:30.580
Because he's taking out your friend

23:30.620 --> 23:32.710
and then coming over here
to have sex with you.

23:32.740 --> 23:36.270
And he's about to become
a father by yet another girl.

23:38.290 --> 23:40.550
Doesn't that tell you anything,Adrian?

23:41.020 --> 23:43.540
Doesn't that tell you that
he really doesn't care about anyone?

23:44.180 --> 23:45.300
He does.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.580
He cares about me.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.870
Stop telling yourself that.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.950
It's a lie,Adrian.

23:51.990 --> 23:53.490
Get out.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.530
Get out of my house.

23:55.570 --> 23:57.660
You don't know that
he doesn't care about me,

23:57.690 --> 23:59.050
but you know something else.

23:59.090 --> 24:00.740
What do you know?

24:03.190 --> 24:05.110
I know that I care about you.

24:07.250 --> 24:08.560
Here's my number.

24:08.590 --> 24:10.120
I'm giving it to you again.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.500
On the back of the card is
the number of the watch captain

24:12.530 --> 24:14.150
for your local police department.

24:14.200 --> 24:21.780
You have any problems,call 911,
then call him,then call me.

24:25.740 --> 24:26.800
Wait.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.410
He cares about me.

24:28.450 --> 24:30.660
Ricky cares about me.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.030
No,sweetheart. He doesn't.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.870
Keep your head down.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.040
There you go. Step into it,though.

24:46.770 --> 24:47.480
Hey,Mom.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.390
Hi,honey. Why is Tom with you?

24:49.430 --> 24:50.360
He left me a note.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.660
He came with Jack.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.800
I know. But why is he there with Jack?

24:53.850 --> 24:55.210
I don't know.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.270
I think they're gonna show up
on every date I have with Ricky.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.140
But it's okay,I'm over it.

24:59.170 --> 25:01.310
They're just being protective or something.

25:01.350 --> 25:03.840
And why is that?
Why would you need protecting?

25:03.880 --> 25:06.120
Well,first of all,
I'm scared of flying baseballs.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.730
Yeah,and secondly?

25:07.770 --> 25:09.930
I think they just don't
want me seeing Ricky.

25:09.980 --> 25:12.450
Everyone's so afraid of bad-boy Ricky.

25:12.490 --> 25:15.050
But,honestly,Mom,when
he's around me,he's so sweet.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.450
Uh-huh. And if he turns
out to be not so sweet,

25:17.490 --> 25:18.830
you'll let me know,right,honey?

25:18.870 --> 25:20.410
- Definitely.
- Okay.

25:20.450 --> 25:22.290
So this is what you called to tell me?

25:22.340 --> 25:23.400
No,I'm calling to tell you

25:23.450 --> 25:25.180
the guys are having
a good time showing off,

25:25.220 --> 25:27.340
so I think we're gonna be
a bit late. Is that okay?

25:27.390 --> 25:29.650
-How much later? 
-Like half an hour.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.116
- Unless that's a problem.
- Okay.

25:31.116 --> 25:32.610
Just a half an hour.
It's a school night.

25:32.650 --> 25:34.000
Okay,thanks,Mom.

25:35.870 --> 25:38.150
- Hi,there.
- Oh,hi.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.250
So which one is your boyfriend?

25:41.100 --> 25:43.810
Um,well,that one over
there is my brother...

25:43.850 --> 25:44.970
Keep your head down.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.140
...and next to him
is my old boyfriend,

25:47.180 --> 25:49.170
and then that's my new boyfriend.

25:49.970 --> 25:51.940
But I think they're
all gonna be friends.

25:54.430 --> 25:55.870
What's going on?

25:58.110 --> 25:59.270
Get away from her!

25:59.940 --> 26:00.970
What are you doing here,huh?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.620
Whoa,whoa,don't do
anything stupid,Ricky.

26:02.670 --> 26:04.450
Don't hit the guy. It's okay.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.070
Yeah,it's okay.

26:06.110 --> 26:07.340
It's never gonna be okay.

26:07.370 --> 26:08.860
Yeah,probably not.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.380
I met Amy.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.780
Seems really nice.

26:12.810 --> 26:14.360
Met her parents too.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.830
I hope you're not planning
on keeping the baby.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.800
They don't think you'd make
a very good father.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.030
Neither do I.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.780
That's the man who called.
Who is that man?

26:34.120 --> 26:35.580
My father.

26:44.780 --> 26:47.190
So I told them about Ricky
because I wanted to.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.410
Maybe I didn't have to,
but I wanted to.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.830
I wanted them to know.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.880
But maybe Ricky is lying.

26:52.940 --> 26:53.960
Maybe he is.

26:53.990 --> 26:56.640
But my gut feeling is that he isn't.

26:58.110 --> 26:59.370
But he could be.

26:59.410 --> 27:03.050
Either way,if I had the baby,
then he'd be around.

27:03.100 --> 27:05.070
And he's got problems,lots of problems.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.630
His creepy father would be around too.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.110
But you have to keep the baby.

27:10.150 --> 27:13.410
I mean,and it's not just
his baby,it's your baby.

27:13.450 --> 27:16.100
And you're carrying her and
you're giving birth to her.

27:16.140 --> 27:18.260
So she's more yours than his.

27:18.290 --> 27:20.020
So it would seem so right now,

27:20.060 --> 27:22.470
but I don't even know
if it's a she yet.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.400
I'll probably find out
the next doctor visit.

27:24.450 --> 27:25.940
I feel like she's a she.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.400
So you've said.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.130
But I think that's because we both
want the baby to be a girl.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.320
Come on.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.770
You wanna keep the baby.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.120
It's your baby.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.290
I love this baby.

27:41.990 --> 27:46.370
I feel so happy every time
I feel her,or him,move.

27:47.850 --> 27:53.720
I just know that despite the way
that she,or he,was conceived

27:53.760 --> 27:56.100
that she or he is gonna be okay.

27:56.920 --> 28:00.060
Everything's gonna be fine,
just like you said.

28:00.090 --> 28:03.020
Okay,but if everything is fine,

28:03.060 --> 28:04.900
and everything will be fine,
then why--?

28:04.930 --> 28:08.180
Ben,I have to consider letting
the baby be adopted.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.620
I have to.

28:09.650 --> 28:11.780
Even though I don't want to.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.820
I wanna marry you and have the baby
and live happily ever after,

28:16.510 --> 28:18.550
but I know that the baby will
have a better chance

28:18.590 --> 28:23.080
at happily ever after if I find the
 right parents for her. Or him.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.500
- Why?
- Ben,

28:24.550 --> 28:27.650
my baby needs a stable,
loving home with two adult parents.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.970
We're not adults.

28:29.005 --> 28:32.560
And you're not even the father.
Ricky is.

28:32.590 --> 28:34.990
And his dad is the grandfather and...

28:36.370 --> 28:38.030
I just-- I have to.

28:38.060 --> 28:39.890
I have to at least consider it.

28:39.930 --> 28:41.420
But we're going to be adults.

28:41.450 --> 28:43.300
And we're practically adults now.

28:43.330 --> 28:47.290
In fact,we're handling this
in a very adult way,but--

28:47.330 --> 28:50.520
Consider adoption,but please,
after you consider it,

28:50.560 --> 28:52.020
consider just keeping the baby.

28:52.070 --> 28:53.540
Ben...

28:53.770 --> 28:55.770
this is going to be hard enough.

28:56.540 --> 28:59.170
And I need you on my side.
I need your support.

28:59.210 --> 29:00.260
What about your parents?

29:00.300 --> 29:01.520
Is this what they want?

29:01.570 --> 29:03.230
It's what my mother wants.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.150
What about your dad?

29:04.190 --> 29:06.390
He hasn't really expressed
his opinion on this,

29:06.430 --> 29:08.530
but he's more emotional
than my mom is.

29:09.170 --> 29:11.850
This cannot be a decision
based on emotion.

29:11.880 --> 29:17.390
This has to be a decision
based on what's best for her. Or him.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.800
Hi,are you okay?

29:22.850 --> 29:24.070
Am I okay?

29:24.100 --> 29:25.500
You didn't show up last night.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.750
Grace must have told you we
ran into someone.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.640
Grace didn't tell me anything.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.980
I haven't seen Grace this morning.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.340
So why aren't you yelling at me
for not showing up last night?

29:34.040 --> 29:35.550
Be glad you didn't show up last night.

29:35.580 --> 29:36.690
Why is that?

29:36.730 --> 29:38.520
Because my father came by to see me.

29:38.550 --> 29:40.980
Oh,what a coincidence.
My father came by to see me.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.510
Back to "Are you okay?"

29:42.540 --> 29:44.810
- Not really.
- My father can help you.

29:44.860 --> 29:47.450
He can keep your father away
and get a restraining order.

29:47.490 --> 29:49.530
How does your father know
anything about my father?

29:49.570 --> 29:50.950
Your father's a criminal.

29:50.980 --> 29:52.230
Not according to him.

29:52.270 --> 29:53.540
According to him,I'm just a liar.

29:53.590 --> 29:56.320
Look,I don't know what he did
or what you saw him do,

29:56.340 --> 29:59.660
but my father can help you get
a restraining order,he told me.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.650
Those are great
for law-abiding citizens.

30:01.690 --> 30:03.650
My father is not
a law-abiding citizen.

30:03.690 --> 30:05.420
He doesn't care if there's
a restraining order.

30:05.460 --> 30:08.400
My foster parents moved to get
a restraining order this morning.

30:08.450 --> 30:09.890
Here's my dad's number.

30:09.930 --> 30:11.770
Just give it to them.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.760
Look,he'll help you. He will.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.430
The only help I need is from you.
I need to see you.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.960
All right.

30:17.990 --> 30:21.870
But just tell me,
what was your father in prison for?

30:21.900 --> 30:22.940
Your father didn't tell you?

30:22.980 --> 30:24.350
No,he said he couldn't tell me.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.720
He robbed someone.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.080
There's Grace. I gotta go.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.390
I'll call you.

30:29.630 --> 30:30.930
Grace,wait up.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.340
- Hey,good morning.
- Good morning.

30:35.380 --> 30:37.180
And I'm so sorry about last night.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.730
My father is a scary guy.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.140
I'm sorry if he scared you.

30:40.180 --> 30:41.550
Yeah,he is.

30:42.270 --> 30:44.220
But you scared me too.

30:44.250 --> 30:45.570
A little.

30:46.230 --> 30:47.930
You know,the bat?
I thought you were gonna hit him.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.010
I would have hit him
if he had laid a hand on you.

30:50.070 --> 30:51.090
I would have killed him.

30:51.120 --> 30:53.770
No,no,I don't want you
to kill anybody for me.

30:53.820 --> 30:55.340
It'd be for both of us.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.280
I've wanted to kill him
for a long time.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.450
You see,that kind of
anger scares me.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.570
Sorry.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.610
I have good reason
to be angry with him.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.860
Look,I can control my anger.
I have to.

31:04.900 --> 31:07.610
If I tell you why I hate him,
you're gonna tell your parents.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.490
They're never gonna let
you go out with me again.

31:09.820 --> 31:15.820
My dad was wondering
if your dad was in prison for hitting you.

31:15.850 --> 31:16.970
Yes.

31:16.990 --> 31:18.880
As well as other things.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.130
I'm so sorry.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.580
Stuff happens.

31:21.620 --> 31:24.700
Especiallyly to kids whose mothers
don't stop stuff from happening

31:24.740 --> 31:27.050
because they're too high.
Those are my parents.

31:27.090 --> 31:30.080
I told you a long time ago
they're scary people.

31:30.130 --> 31:32.510
Do you think we could
talk for a few minutes?

31:33.290 --> 31:35.370
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:35.410 --> 31:38.070
I understand my father met you
and your parents last night.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.850
Yeah. He just showed up at our house.

31:40.890 --> 31:42.110
I'm sorry.

31:43.070 --> 31:45.110
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:45.150 --> 31:46.810
I'll let you two talk.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.560
Call me later,okay? Bye,Amy.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.720
Wait.It's okay to call you,
even after what your dad asked,

31:51.780 --> 31:53.410
after what I told you?

31:53.450 --> 31:55.530
Of course it is.
You didn't do anything.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.010
It wasn't your fault.

31:57.050 --> 32:00.030
And besides,you're working
on everything. I think it's great.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.630
It's admirable,even.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.990
I'll talk to you later.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.280
Everyone's feeling
sorry for me,I guess.

32:09.310 --> 32:10.820
It's not a good feeling.

32:10.850 --> 32:12.910
Maybe it should be,but it's not.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.940
Lauren told you.
I know she told you.

32:15.980 --> 32:17.440
Did you tell your parents?

32:17.480 --> 32:18.620
Yeah.

32:18.660 --> 32:21.020
Great. Look,I know where this is going.

32:21.050 --> 32:24.330
Ricky,I wanna consider adoption

32:24.360 --> 32:26.990
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd go along with that.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.150
I don't know about that.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.210
I'm just letting you know that

32:29.250 --> 32:31.960
I wanna consider letting some
nice couple adopt the baby.

32:31.990 --> 32:33.510
Afraid of me touching the kid?

32:33.550 --> 32:35.220
No,it's not about you.

32:35.260 --> 32:36.270
It's not even about me.

32:36.310 --> 32:38.760
It's about the baby,
what's best for the baby.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.690
Yeah,well,what if I think
what's best for the baby

32:40.740 --> 32:42.430
is to know his or her birth parents?

32:42.460 --> 32:44.480
Maybe what's best for the baby
is to grow up in your home,

32:44.520 --> 32:47.190
with me coming to see him. Or her.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.120
Do you even know what it is yet?

32:48.160 --> 32:51.680
No. But my parents aren't just
gonna raise the baby for me.

32:51.710 --> 32:53.340
Yeah,why should they?
Why can't you?

32:53.380 --> 32:54.890
Why can't you and me do it?

32:54.930 --> 32:57.540
It's not like they're gonna kick
you out of the house,is it?

32:57.570 --> 32:59.650
You still have a place
to live,food to eat.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.170
Yeah,but...

33:01.200 --> 33:04.340
How are you and me gonna
raise a child? How are we gonna do it?

33:04.380 --> 33:07.220
I don't have a job,you don't,
we don't have insurance.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.400
Half the country doesn't have
insurance and is out of work.

33:10.450 --> 33:12.920
They don't just put their sons
and daughters up for adoption

33:12.960 --> 33:14.470
because they can't pay a few bills.

33:14.510 --> 33:17.830
We're teenagers.
We're in high school.

33:17.870 --> 33:20.610
I would like to graduate high
school and go to college.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.520
You know,and have a career
and eventually marry Ben.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.880
I just wanna have ha normal

33:24.930 --> 33:27.040
Look,I thought this
wasn't about you.

33:28.230 --> 33:32.090
Guess what,Amy,you're not
gonna have a normal life.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.630
I don't.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.480
I don't have a normal life.

33:35.530 --> 33:37.940
Lots of people don't have normal lives.

33:38.370 --> 33:39.770
So what?

33:41.210 --> 33:42.770
And no. The answer's no.

33:42.810 --> 33:44.690
I'm not going along with it.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.570
I'm not gonna agree
to having the baby adopted.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.380
I don't care what you two want.

33:51.410 --> 33:53.680
I'm not my father,you got it?

34:06.070 --> 34:07.130
Is that what Amy wants?

34:07.160 --> 34:09.870
Mm,not really.
Amy wants me to raise the baby.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.050
She wants to leave the baby
with me while she's in school.

34:13.070 --> 34:14.350
And then when
she comes home at dinner,

34:14.380 --> 34:17.500
I'll have dinner waiting for her,
the baby clean and fed,

34:17.540 --> 34:21.690
and she can go do her homework
and practice her French horn.

34:21.719 --> 34:24.389
Oh,and then on the weekends,
she can hang out with Ben

34:24.420 --> 34:28.010
and nothing really will have changed
except that there'll be a baby.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.080
That's what Amy wants.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.730
Oh,no one really likes to have
their life disturbed, now,do they?

34:32.760 --> 34:34.250
No,they do not.

34:35.020 --> 34:37.090
Although my life is going
through some big changes

34:37.130 --> 34:38.730
and I'm kind of happy about that.

34:38.760 --> 34:39.929
What sort of changes?

34:39.980 --> 34:43.659
Well,I'm going to work for
the first time in quite a long time

34:43.679 --> 34:46.340
and I'm about to be single again.

34:46.389 --> 34:48.120
Well,that's very exciting.

34:48.159 --> 34:49.460
What sort of job did you get?

34:49.500 --> 34:51.219
Oh,I haven't gotten a job yet.

34:51.260 --> 34:53.960
I thinking I might
be going back to school.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.030
I've always been interested
in architecture.

34:56.070 --> 34:58.800
Ah. Did you study
architecture in college?

34:58.840 --> 35:01.720
No,I didn't graduate from college.

35:02.430 --> 35:04.440
I was in,um,Women's Studies.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.310
Oh. So you'd be starting over

35:07.360 --> 35:09.240
and it would take a few years.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.960
But once you get that degree,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.550
you'd be doing work in
a field you really love.

35:13.590 --> 35:14.550
Is that the idea?

35:14.580 --> 35:16.650
Yeah.That's the idea.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.070
You don't approve of the idea?

35:20.100 --> 35:21.810
I love it.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.410
Not that I'm here to judge anyone.

35:24.090 --> 35:27.190
I wish I could go back to school,
get my Ph.D. in philosophy.

35:27.230 --> 35:29.010
I have a masters in Theology.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.350
Why don't you?

35:30.400 --> 35:32.100
Don't have the time or the money.

35:33.670 --> 35:36.320
So are you gonna work at something
else while you go to school?

35:36.350 --> 35:38.150
I guess I'll have to.

35:38.180 --> 35:40.520
And what kind of job are
you looking for? Maybe I can help.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.670
Um,well,in a related field,I guess.

35:43.700 --> 35:47.150
Like for the city? Uh,permit office,
something like that?

35:47.190 --> 35:49.520
Well,I was thinking maybe
an architect's office?

35:49.560 --> 35:52.780
Hm. Answering phones,
general office work?

35:52.820 --> 35:55.570
Kind of 9-to-5,classes at night?

35:56.540 --> 35:57.650
Well...

35:57.700 --> 35:58.790
Let me check around.

35:58.820 --> 36:02.310
Maybe there's someone in the church
who needs help in an architect's office.

36:03.350 --> 36:04.790
Wow.

36:06.220 --> 36:08.060
I sound,um...

36:09.030 --> 36:10.890
I sound just like Amy,don't I?

36:10.920 --> 36:13.830
You do have some big changes
taking place in your life.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.910
And you're gonna have to go back to work,

36:15.950 --> 36:18.990
and your life is gonna get
turned upside down,so yes,

36:19.030 --> 36:20.990
maybe a little like Amy.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.630
Thank you.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.110
Anytime.

36:28.300 --> 36:31.190
Do you have an attorney looking
into a private adoption?

36:31.230 --> 36:33.710
Someone who can maybe line
up some choices for Amy?

36:33.750 --> 36:36.230
Well,my attorney can handle
the adoption process,

36:36.270 --> 36:39.390
but she doesn't wanna be involved
in the selection process.

36:39.430 --> 36:42.300
So I was thinking that maybe
you knew of a nice couple.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.350
Yes,a few nice couples.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.600
Well,we're considering it.
You know,just looking into it.

36:50.610 --> 36:52.860
I really don't know what
the best thing to do here is.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.530
Neither do I.

36:54.590 --> 36:57.390
I don't know the best thing.
I wish I did.

36:59.410 --> 37:01.830
So do you know if
the baby's a boy or a girl?

37:01.870 --> 37:04.240
Oh,we don't know.
I mean,Amy doesn't know yet.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.230
Still in a bit of
a state of shock,huh?

37:07.270 --> 37:08.450
A bit.

37:08.480 --> 37:10.700
Well,that'll wear off
in a few years.

37:16.330 --> 37:17.710
I'll walk out with you.

37:17.740 --> 37:19.070
Why's that?

37:19.120 --> 37:21.110
He's not gonna leave you alone.

37:21.140 --> 37:22.110
Probably not.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.850
Well,why's he coming around now?

37:23.880 --> 37:25.920
I don't know.
He does that once in a while.

37:25.970 --> 37:27.590
How come he's not in prison?

37:27.630 --> 37:29.450
Because he's a better liar than I am.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.600
He must be pretty good ty n.

37:32.940 --> 37:35.650
She's in love with you.
I can see it.

37:35.690 --> 37:38.310
And I have no interest
in keeping her away from you.

37:38.350 --> 37:40.960
In fact,I pray that she's
the woman that changes your life.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.870
What makes you think
my life needs changing?

37:42.890 --> 37:44.740
Because you're still seeing Adrian.

37:50.390 --> 37:51.680
Hello.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.710
Oh. Hey,yeah,sorry.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.690
Are you busy thinking
about something,or...?

37:55.730 --> 37:57.550
Just... Yeah.

37:58.260 --> 38:00.150
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

38:00.180 --> 38:01.200
Yeah,you don't look fine.

38:01.250 --> 38:02.840
I'm fine. How are you?

38:02.870 --> 38:04.160
This can wait.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.510
- I heard you got married.
- Yeah.

38:08.090 --> 38:10.460
Did you come down here
to voice your opinion on that?

38:10.510 --> 38:11.780
No,I came down here because

38:11.830 --> 38:13.870
I got a note to come
down here after school.

38:13.910 --> 38:15.120
Oh,right.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.810
I found something for you to do.

38:16.850 --> 38:18.940
Your,uh,community service thing.

38:19.890 --> 38:21.230
How'd you like to mentor a kid?

38:21.280 --> 38:23.940
I got caught making fake IDs and
I get to mentor a kid now?

38:23.970 --> 38:26.410
Oh,come on,you didn't do it.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.660
And I still don't like the fact
that you let Joe off the hook with that.

38:29.690 --> 38:30.380
Who is it?

38:30.420 --> 38:31.700
It's a kid who needs a mentor.

38:31.730 --> 38:33.020
I don't know him personally.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.260
Yeah,I'll do it.

38:34.290 --> 38:36.500
Good. You'd make a good mentor.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.740
You don't always do the right thing,

38:38.770 --> 38:40.870
but seems like you're always
trying to do the right thing,

38:40.910 --> 38:42.080
and that's something.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.470
At least you're trying.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.810
Here's the information.

38:48.810 --> 38:51.750
Uh,do I get a gun with this?

38:51.790 --> 38:53.050
This is a gang area.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.430
Not too many people in your neighborhood

38:55.470 --> 38:57.040
asking to be mentored.

38:57.070 --> 39:01.340
And not everyone who lives in
a gang neighborhood is in a gang.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.910
I don't think a gang member
is asking for a mentor,do you?

39:04.950 --> 39:07.750
Okay. Well,if I don't show up
for school tomorrow,

39:07.780 --> 39:09.200
you'll know where to find me.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.590
- Hey,before you go...
- Yeah.

39:13.030 --> 39:14.360
So you met Ricky's father?

39:14.400 --> 39:16.430
- Briefly,yeah.
- And?

39:16.460 --> 39:19.130
And he's scarier than
the neighborhood you're sending me to.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.620
Great.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.640
Or scarier than marrying
the wrong person.

39:36.220 --> 39:38.680
I can't find any job that
I'm qualified for.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.060
I told you I'd get a job.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.320
What are you qualified for?

39:45.360 --> 39:47.740
You're no more qualified
for any job than I am.

39:48.310 --> 39:50.340
Maybe,but I'm not pregnant.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.240
Hi,girls.

39:56.380 --> 39:58.270
Oh,thanks for the big fake smiles.

39:58.310 --> 39:59.840
Good night.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.570
Good night.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.110
Amy,

40:05.530 --> 40:08.650
I'm not trying to make your
decision for you about the baby.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.170
I'm really not.

40:10.210 --> 40:12.580
Well,you kind of are
since you won't help me.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.850
Well,I think that's my cue to leave.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.130
Night.

40:18.170 --> 40:19.590
Good night.

40:23.210 --> 40:26.110
Amy,I'm gonna help you once in a while,

40:26.150 --> 40:30.510
but I'm really not in
a position to take care of a baby.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.460
I have to get a job too.

40:32.510 --> 40:34.300
And I'd like to find a job that I love,

40:34.360 --> 40:35.720
so that means I'm probably
gonna have to work

40:35.770 --> 40:37.800
and go to school at the same time,

40:37.830 --> 40:41.420
so you and me are both kind
of in the same boat,kid.

40:41.460 --> 40:44.030
I know that if you wanna
find a job,you will.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.340
And if you think that you
can take care of the baby

40:46.380 --> 40:48.990
and provide a secure home
for the baby,then you will.

40:49.020 --> 40:49.990
But if,on the other hand,

40:50.050 --> 40:52.870
you decide that you wanna
go for adoption,

40:52.900 --> 40:55.400
I hope that you'll do it not
because it's the easier choice,

40:55.440 --> 40:57.500
but because it's the better choice.

40:57.910 --> 40:59.960
But,ultimately,the choice is yours.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.590
What kind of job are you gonna get?

41:01.640 --> 41:03.380
The first one I'm offered.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.290
I'd like to work in
an architecture firm

41:06.320 --> 41:10.320
even if it's just answering phones
and doing administrative stuff.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.920
Phones?

41:11.960 --> 41:13.260
But you could do so much more.

41:13.300 --> 41:15.980
But,Amy,you can't just wake up
and be an architect.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.820
Mom,you could.

41:17.860 --> 41:18.920
You're really smart.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.070
There it is again.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.840
- What?
- Oh,Amy.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.830
You and I are so much alike.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.380
I think that's why I've been
so angry at you lately.

41:26.410 --> 41:28.700
I see you making
the same mistakes that I make.

41:28.890 --> 41:30.880
What mistake are we talking about now?

41:30.920 --> 41:34.670
We're both acting like we don't
wanna be disturbed by life.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.050
You're acting like nothing's gonna change,

41:37.090 --> 41:38.230
except you're gonna have a baby.

41:38.270 --> 41:39.810
I'm acting like nothing's
gonna change,

41:39.840 --> 41:41.510
except I'm losing a husband.

41:41.550 --> 41:43.070
Everything's gonna change.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.700
We're about to
be disturbed on all levels.

41:45.740 --> 41:47.390
But that's okay.

41:47.440 --> 41:50.080
Everything's changing
constantly anyway.

41:50.130 --> 41:52.240
Just you don't usually see it coming.

41:54.530 --> 41:58.010
But maybe we should keep
our eyes open,you and me.

41:58.760 --> 42:04.120
Maybe we're about to find
something exciting and wonderful.

42:04.580 --> 42:07.310
Maybe we're about to find some
real meaning in all of this.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.080
- Like what?
- I don't know.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.630
Maybe your real purpose is
that you're going to give a child

42:11.660 --> 42:14.560
to a family that wouldn't
be able to have a child otherwise.

42:14.590 --> 42:15.700
Maybe.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.240
But hey,look at me.

42:17.290 --> 42:19.070
One thing's not going to change.

42:19.110 --> 42:20.770
And that's that I love you.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.860
And I'm here for you always.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.410
Me too,Mom.

42:35.660 --> 42:37.370
Not so fast.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.360
- Going to see Adrian?
- You.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.510
You're not supposed to
be within 300 feet of me.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.280
I'm your father.

42:42.330 --> 42:43.970
Biological father.

42:44.010 --> 42:45.970
You're gonna like
what I have to say.

42:46.010 --> 42:47.680
Whatever it is,
I don't wanna hear it.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.940
Now get lost!

42:48.970 --> 42:50.100
You know how much money some families

42:50.120 --> 42:52.780
would pay for a healthy
Caucasian baby?

42:52.810 --> 42:54.010
You're sick.

42:54.050 --> 42:56.310
You're the biological father
of this child,kiddo.

42:56.350 --> 42:58.510
Life is what you make of it.

42:58.540 --> 43:00.390
I know some people.
