00:12.099 --> 00:14.362
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.320
Excuse me.
I need to see Sergeant Reagan.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.496
He expecting you?No. I'm Connor O'Brien.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.195
I'm his Chevy mechanic.I'm sorry. His what?

00:21.238 --> 00:23.066
Could you please just ask...?JAMIE: Hold on.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.373
Hey, Connor,
come on back.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.029
I'm real sorry
to bother you.No. What's the matter?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.249
What's going on?

00:33.076 --> 00:34.512
This.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.079
Okay.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.515
And this.Mm.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.517
And this.And this is?

00:39.561 --> 00:41.084
My daughter Caitlin.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.217
You're certain?

00:43.260 --> 00:45.219
There's no face
on any of these.

00:45.262 --> 00:48.004
That birthmark,
that tattoo.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.571
Okay.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.660
She's been a mess.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.140
She wouldn't tell me
what was up,

00:53.183 --> 00:54.402
so I looked through
her browser history.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.882
I thought maybe
she was being bullied,

00:56.926 --> 00:58.493
but then I found this.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.495
"Revenge porn" they call it.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.236
I-I looked it up.All right, take it
easy. Take it easy.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.064
You need to get
these taken down.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.891
That's not what I do,
but I'll refer you

01:05.935 --> 01:07.328
to the right department.No, no, no.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.417
We need to keep this
on the down-low. Please.Okay.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.114
Okay, take it easy. Just...

01:11.158 --> 01:12.420
[crying]Take it easy, all right?

01:12.463 --> 01:15.031
Officer, can I get a glass
of water, please?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.293
[whooshing on TV][door closes]

01:16.337 --> 01:19.166
Hey, buddy.
How was school?

01:19.209 --> 01:21.168
Fine.You hungry?

01:21.211 --> 01:23.170
Always.

01:23.213 --> 01:26.042
Hey, uh, weren't you supposed
to get your results back

01:26.086 --> 01:27.696
from the NYPD exam today?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.741
[weapons firing on TV]

01:31.178 --> 01:32.440
Hello?

01:32.483 --> 01:34.268
Earth to Sam.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.096
Hey! I-I was on the final boss.

01:36.139 --> 01:37.619
I'myour final boss.

01:37.662 --> 01:38.968
You get the results?

01:39.011 --> 01:41.057
Yeah.And?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.407
I didn't pass.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.628
Really? Why?

01:46.671 --> 01:48.151
Guess I didn't get
enough answers right.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.848
Oh, so you're gonna be
a wise guy, too, now?

01:49.892 --> 01:51.937
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

01:53.243 --> 01:55.463
You could take it again.
I'll work with you.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.812
I can't take that test again.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.422
Oh, yes, you can.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.163
You agreed to this.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.251
You mean youagreed.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.123
Hey, don't you put this
back on me.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.168
You said you wanted to be a cop.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.431
Now you can't just quit
'cause the going gets tough.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.259
Yeah? And what if I do?

02:09.303 --> 02:11.261
Those are my rules,

02:11.305 --> 02:14.264
and as far as I can see,
this is still myhouse.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.146
So,

02:26.189 --> 02:28.148
former Officer Rick Austin.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.324
Lost his thumb and index finger

02:30.367 --> 02:33.979
on his shooting hand in 2015,
his first year on the job.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.981
So, in the line of duty?

02:36.025 --> 02:39.202
Yeah. He was attacked with
a machete on the Lexington line.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.597
So heroOfficer Austin?

02:42.640 --> 02:46.427
Yeah, he got, uh,
three-quarters disability,

02:46.470 --> 02:48.124
so, about 30K a year.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.214
In 2017, he started

02:51.258 --> 02:53.173
posting motivational
videos on YouTube,

02:53.216 --> 02:57.960
which led to speaking tours and
bookings at corporate retreats.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.746
You know something?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.400
I got all sorts of people

03:03.444 --> 03:05.837
who handle this kind of stuff
for me.

03:05.881 --> 03:10.102
I'm not really sure
what my role is in this.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.889
His spiel is "Every
man for himself."

03:13.932 --> 03:16.326
How you've got to
reject all the family

03:16.370 --> 03:18.807
and teamwork aspect
of workplace culture.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.026
Using his experience
with the NYPD

03:21.070 --> 03:23.420
as the, like, uh...

03:23.464 --> 03:24.682
What's that called?

03:24.726 --> 03:28.425
A cautionary tale.
How the NYPD broke all

03:28.469 --> 03:32.081
its promises of solidarity and
security and just spit him out.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.692
Uh...

03:34.736 --> 03:38.130
He wears the uniform
and uses our logos for his show.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.091
Well, maybe I'm just
in a generous mood,

03:42.134 --> 03:43.614
but I think we're big enough

03:43.658 --> 03:46.313
to absorb this poor guy's beef.
Next?

03:48.532 --> 03:51.100
He made almost six
figures last year

03:51.143 --> 03:53.537
while still drawing
a full pension.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.500
So our hero's double-dipping?

03:59.543 --> 04:02.590
Which is why this is
landing on your desk.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.027
If the bean counters
pull his pension,

04:05.070 --> 04:07.943
you are Commissioner
Ebenezer Scrooge.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.511
And he's got a
great big megaphone.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.123
So do I.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.472
You don't want
to get into this.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.561
Then why the hell
did you bring it to me?

04:17.605 --> 04:19.171
The bean counters made us.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.306
Are you scared
of bean counters, too?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.090
They want to pull his pension
by lunchtime.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.657
We thought
you should be in on it.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.052
[sighs]

04:36.188 --> 04:37.320
BAEZ:
Anybody come around here

04:37.364 --> 04:39.017
regularly?
A boyfriend maybe?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.410
No.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.499
Not in the five years
Jane Miller's lived here?

04:42.543 --> 04:45.023
I know. I always
wondered, too. Nice girl.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.242
Pretty, too.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.765
What about family and friends?

04:47.809 --> 04:49.245
She didn't list
a contact number.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.421
And no one came
looking for her?No. A package came.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.554
I knew she'd be up here,
but she didn't answer,

04:53.597 --> 04:54.903
so...All right.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.165
We got it from here.

04:58.602 --> 05:00.561
It's quite the
setup, huh?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.824
Yeah. Fancy place.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.739
Take it easy.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.088
We don't have a warrant.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.437
And she doesn't
have a heartbeat.

05:07.481 --> 05:10.222
Not to mention, she has no
family or friends, so...

05:10.266 --> 05:13.269
Come on.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.227
Take a quick peek.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.625
There's got to be hundreds here.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.497
BAEZ:
From who?

05:23.540 --> 05:26.238
Green Haven
Correctional Facility.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.284
Inmates?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.243
Seems like Jane does
have a lot of friends.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.158
They're all in prison.

05:36.205 --> 05:39.295

JAMIE:
Hey.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.800
Hey.New coffeemaker came.
I test-drove it.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.889
I feel like I could run
a marathon right now.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.021
You got a second?Yeah. What's up?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.414
In here.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.503
Uh, have a seat.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.245
Don't freak out.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.290
What?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.686
What am I looking at?

06:22.730 --> 06:24.645
A revenge porn site.
One of about ten

06:24.688 --> 06:26.168
that I found these pictures on.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.126
Slow day at the office?

06:28.170 --> 06:29.258
Friend of mine's daughter.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.044
Did you send it up
to Computer Crime?

06:33.088 --> 06:34.394
No. He asked me to handle it.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.571
Jamie, you are
in no position to...I know that.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.703
Does he know who posted it?

06:39.747 --> 06:41.836
She hasn't said much.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.577
Think you can get her to talk?

06:44.752 --> 06:47.363
What, 'cause I
went through this?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.712
That make me some kind of guru?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.148
'Cause she's way more likely

06:50.192 --> 06:52.150
to open up to you
than me or her dad.

06:52.194 --> 06:55.850
Does Dad realize that
these are selfies?I don't know.

06:55.893 --> 06:58.069
I didn't bring it up to him.
He's kind of a wreck.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.897
[sighs]

06:59.941 --> 07:01.595
I don't know, Jamie.

07:01.638 --> 07:05.337
Even if she did send 'em first,
she didn't send 'em here.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.475
You got me into this.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.650
You want me to take the lead?

07:13.694 --> 07:15.347
Are we in your office?

07:15.391 --> 07:18.176
Do you worry about the PR
implications before you speak?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.439
When appropriate.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.092
My interrogation skills
could be put

07:21.136 --> 07:22.485
to good use here, boss.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.573
All set.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.403
Morning.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.926
Commissioner.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.450

Lieutenant Gormley,

07:30.493 --> 07:31.625
DCPI Moore.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.626
Sit down, please.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.505
It seems
there is a misunderstanding

07:42.549 --> 07:44.507
about how our pensions work.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.945
I appreciate this opportunity
to clear it up.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.773
Well, I read the paperwork,

07:49.817 --> 07:52.080
but I'm-I'm missing two fingers
on my good hand,

07:52.123 --> 07:55.344
and the pension doesn't even
begin to cover that, so...

07:55.387 --> 07:59.348
Well, I see your logic,
but the fact remains...

07:59.391 --> 08:00.828
It's pennies?

08:00.871 --> 08:02.438
[laughs airily]

08:03.570 --> 08:06.486
30 grand a year, untaxed,
is hardly pennies.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.142
I got three kids
and-and limited prospects

08:11.186 --> 08:13.275
on account of the disfigurement
that I suffered

08:13.318 --> 08:16.060
as an NYPD officer
in the line of duty.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.061
Disfigurement?

08:17.105 --> 08:18.846
Yeah.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.588
Got the right claw,
so I have to wear the glove.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.068
And I get a lifetime
of Michael Jackson jokes.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.201
I promise, we're on your side.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.855
Oh, that'd be a first.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.858
GORMLEY:
Listen, we could've just

08:30.901 --> 08:32.250
turned you in to the IRS.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.210
I put my life on the line
for this job.

08:35.253 --> 08:36.820
Which is why
you are sitting here

08:36.864 --> 08:39.562
and not in front of the IRS.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.172
I need that money.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.826
I-I deserve the money.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.872
Well, you can say that
all you want,

08:44.915 --> 08:46.787
but it won't change
the way it works.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.223
GARRETT:
Here's the deal.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.833
You can continue
to make a great living

08:49.877 --> 08:51.574
by criticizing this department.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.358
We'll defend your right
to do that.

08:53.402 --> 08:56.927
Even overlook the unlicenseduse
of our logos and signage.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.973
I deserve that money.

09:01.453 --> 09:05.762
So long as you declare your
income against your pension.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.938
Commissioner,

09:07.982 --> 09:10.071
I decided to join the NYPD

09:10.114 --> 09:12.856
when I saw you speak
at my Iona graduation.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.597
Do you want to know
what you said?

09:14.641 --> 09:15.990
That the NYPD is a brotherhood.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.557
That we take care of each other,

09:17.600 --> 09:19.210
that we don't give up
on each other.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.386
You're stealing
from our pension fund!

09:22.779 --> 09:25.477
I wouldn't call that
brotherhood.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.044
I accept a pension
that I was promised,

09:27.088 --> 09:29.569
it's far less than I deserve.Well, that's how it works!

09:29.612 --> 09:31.092
You want to take my money,
you're gonna have to serve me,

09:31.135 --> 09:33.355
because I'm not going down
without a fight.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.839
[door closes]

09:41.015 --> 09:43.017
That went well.

09:46.063 --> 09:49.110
Jane Miller did pro bono work
for some of the inmates here.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.851
Or that's what she
claimed to be doing.

09:50.894 --> 09:53.375
Take it you weren't much
of a fan?

09:53.418 --> 09:55.377
She paraded around here
in her little skirt suits,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.770
playing lawyer.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.380
[scoffs]
She wasn't fooling me.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.034
What do you think she was doing?

10:00.077 --> 10:01.122
Eating up the attention.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.690
Anyone's attention
in particular?

10:03.733 --> 10:06.257
She had a thing for Winston
Hill. Made that very clear.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.390
How so?Jane believed

10:08.433 --> 10:10.044
Winston was special, innocent.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.873
He was like her cause.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.440
Okay, well, we're gonna need
to speak to this Winston Hill.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.181
Can't do that here.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.530
You're denying us access?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.576
Winston was released last week

10:20.620 --> 10:23.274
on account of Jane Miller's
gaming the system, you ask me.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.672
CONNOR:
Thank you. I just...

10:29.716 --> 10:31.500
I don't know
where to start.

10:31.543 --> 10:34.851
Oh, how about
you introduce me to Caitlin?

10:34.895 --> 10:37.898
Of course. Caitlin,
someone to see you!

10:37.941 --> 10:40.074
Caitlin!CAITLIN: Coming!

10:48.343 --> 10:50.867
Hi, I'm Eddie.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.826
You the cop?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.175
I'm just here as a friend.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.830
Who's here to help us
wake up from this nightmare.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.312
Hey, could I get a glass
of water?

11:01.356 --> 11:02.749
Sure.
Thanks.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.969
About ten minutes from now?

11:06.013 --> 11:08.058
Sure.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.541
So...

11:12.584 --> 11:16.719
I had a guy post naked pictures

11:16.763 --> 11:19.330
of me on the Internet.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.767
The hardest
part, for me,

11:20.810 --> 11:23.595
was accepting
that it wasn't my fault.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.817
This isn't your fault, either.

11:35.129 --> 11:38.436
You probably sent those

11:38.480 --> 11:40.482
to someone that
you trusted.

11:40.525 --> 11:43.006
Maybe loved, even.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.922
Yeah, well, live and learn.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.794
Bad breakup?
Yeah.

11:47.837 --> 11:52.189
I broke up with him
a few weeks ago,

11:52.233 --> 11:55.366
so I guess some payback is,

11:55.410 --> 11:57.542
you know, expected.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.023
Well, this is more
than just payback.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.025
This is a crime.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.071
I don't want to escalate it.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.595
I don't care what
my dad wants.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.162
You don't want those
pictures taken down?

12:08.205 --> 12:10.120
Of course I do.

12:10.164 --> 12:13.558
But not if it's gonna get Luis
all busted in the process.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.561
Luis is the ex?
Yeah.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.955
But you can't take this
any further.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.350
I can't? Why not?

12:22.393 --> 12:23.612
'Cause, I...

12:25.266 --> 12:27.964
[quietly]:
'Cause it'll come out
that I sent the pics

12:28.008 --> 12:29.531
to Luis in the first place,

12:29.574 --> 12:31.141
and my dad'll have
a heart attack.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.405
For real.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.668
Look, I'm begging you,

12:36.712 --> 12:39.584
just let it slide.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.938
[sighs]

12:49.072 --> 12:51.814
Hey. I just got
a very angry call

12:51.858 --> 12:53.468
from our friends
at DCAS.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.556
About?

12:54.599 --> 12:56.601
About one of my
investigators

12:56.645 --> 12:58.603
who went down there
flashing his shield,

12:58.647 --> 13:01.911
looking for intel on
an official city exam.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.131
Just wanted to see
Sam's test results.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.959
I wanted to know why
he didn't pass

13:06.002 --> 13:08.657
so I can see what he needs
to work on for next time.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.877
It steps on a line,
Anthony, and you know it.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.661
It's perfectly normal
to want to know

13:12.704 --> 13:14.837
what's going on
so I can help him.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.144
The normal thing to do
would have been

13:17.187 --> 13:20.016
to ask Sam what Sam
needs to work on,

13:20.060 --> 13:22.149
not a state office.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.151
He wouldn't talk to me.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.500
So you just gave up.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.676
No, I-I went to find out
what I could.

13:27.719 --> 13:29.721
Are you really
gonna lecture me

13:29.765 --> 13:31.941
about trying to
help out family?No, but...

13:31.985 --> 13:34.683
And foster family
is still family.

13:34.726 --> 13:38.295
So don't say it's not.I wouldn't.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.428
So, when is he gonna
take the test?

13:40.471 --> 13:42.691
That's the other thing.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.736
He said he's not.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.048
Ah, what now?[man shouting]

13:52.092 --> 13:54.181
Let me in there!

13:54.224 --> 13:56.357
Please, I just want to
talk to him, that's all.
Just let me in!

13:56.400 --> 13:58.011
I just need to talk to him.What the hell's going on?

13:58.054 --> 13:59.751
OFFICER: That guy was trying
to get inside the halfway house.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.318
Caused a scene when
he was turned away.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.538
MAN: Please! I'm serious!Hey.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.669
Hey, hey, hey, hey!I'm not leaving

14:04.713 --> 14:06.062
until I see that bastard!Hey!

14:06.106 --> 14:08.021
You need to settle down, now!

14:08.064 --> 14:09.892
Who the hell are you?

14:09.936 --> 14:11.851
I'm Detective Reagan.
Who the hell are you?

14:11.894 --> 14:13.200
Richard Lockhart.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.766
I need to speak
with that man.

14:14.810 --> 14:15.767
What man?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.639
Winston Hill.Get in line.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.424
N-- You still
looking into him?

14:20.468 --> 14:21.773
No, we haven't even
started yet.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.123
Why, what's it to you?

14:23.166 --> 14:25.734
Winston Hill killed my daughter.

14:25.777 --> 14:26.996
You're Jane Miller's father?

14:27.040 --> 14:30.913
N-No,
I'm Leah Lockhart's father.

14:30.957 --> 14:35.048
Winston Hill murdered
my daughter six years ago.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.311
And now he's free,
living here!

14:42.969 --> 14:45.014
Drop the flashlight.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.842
You sure they're not
gonna let him in?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.062
I said drop the flashlight, now!

14:51.978 --> 14:53.414
Look, I feel for Mr. Lockhart.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.720
All right, it's hard for me
to see him like that again,

14:55.764 --> 14:57.157
like back in the trial.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.506
But I don't want
no more trouble.DANNY: Why?

14:58.549 --> 14:59.942
'Cause you murdered
his daughter?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.552
No, I didn't.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.467
The court saw that,
and they let me free.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.686
On a technicality.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.950
I was innocent
from the jump.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.865
BAEZ: We're not here
about Mr. Lockhart.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.780
We want to talk
about Jane Miller.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.260
What about her?

15:13.303 --> 15:14.652
What was your relationship?

15:14.696 --> 15:17.177
She's my lawyer.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.265
She volunteered
to take my appeal.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.744
Hmm.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.485
When was the last time
you saw her?

15:21.529 --> 15:23.618
My last court day.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.533
I guess...DANNY: You guess?

15:25.576 --> 15:27.752
You don't remember
being in her apartment

15:27.796 --> 15:28.971
last Monday night?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.190
No, no, I wasn't.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.278
[chuckles]
Where were you?

15:31.321 --> 15:32.583
I was right here.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.150
With who?

15:34.194 --> 15:35.673
Whoever else was here.
What's this about?

15:35.717 --> 15:36.848
Something happen to Jane?

15:38.111 --> 15:39.677
Jane Miller is dead.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.810
What?

15:41.853 --> 15:43.638
She was gunned down
in her apartment.

15:43.681 --> 15:47.424
No.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.600
No, no!

15:55.650 --> 15:57.739
You're gonna have to try
a little bit harder

15:57.782 --> 15:59.523
than that, Mr. Hill.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.007
You think I did it.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.195
Hey, I'm home.

16:19.239 --> 16:22.068
Sam?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.896
Come on, pal.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.637
Open the door.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.248
I'm coming in.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.747
Well, he was only
on the job for a year,

16:49.791 --> 16:51.880
so yeah, he drew
the lowest pension rate:

16:51.923 --> 16:53.273
three-quarters
of a rookie's salary.

16:53.316 --> 16:54.361
Hang on a sec.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.058
What?

16:56.102 --> 16:58.060
"Beloved author."

16:58.104 --> 16:59.235
There are a million
beloved authors.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.411
What kind of clue is that?

17:01.455 --> 17:02.586
Any letters?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.414
Last letter, "N."

17:04.458 --> 17:06.286
Toni Morrison.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.070
She wrote a great book
called Beloved.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.942
So, the guy is making
a nice pile

17:10.986 --> 17:12.988
as some kind of
motivational speaker,

17:13.032 --> 17:14.729
but he's still drawing
his full pension.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.513
Drawing it
with two fingers missing.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.647
Well, yeah, but I still
gotta turn him in.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.866
And get called Scrooge?

17:21.910 --> 17:24.347
That's what Garrett said.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.219
Well, Garrett's right.

17:26.262 --> 17:30.092
Look, a cop says he can
barely move his arms

17:30.136 --> 17:31.572
because of his injuries,

17:31.615 --> 17:34.401
gets photographed on
the first tee at Bethpage,

17:34.444 --> 17:36.316
everyone gets that.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.535
But this guy is not that guy.

17:38.579 --> 17:42.800
The bean counters say
I have to claw his pension back.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.325
They work for you.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.459
I make this exception,
I'm an insurance adjuster

17:49.503 --> 17:50.504
the rest of my time there.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.027
They'll come out
of the woodwork.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.377
You don't, you're Scrooge.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.383
Gee... thanks, Pop.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.732
Good talk.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.038
I feel so much better now.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.822
HENRY:
You're welcome.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.221
[sighs]

18:13.396 --> 18:15.398
And how about Sandra Jones?

18:15.442 --> 18:16.878
Her story checks out.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.445
So we're on the
right track here?

18:18.488 --> 18:20.621
That's for you to decide.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.277
How's it going with Sam?

18:24.320 --> 18:27.541
It isn't. He ran away.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.152
He just ran away?

18:30.196 --> 18:33.503
He left a note,
thanking me for everything.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.115
And did you try
to find him?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.812
I made a couple calls,
and then I stopped.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.248
Anthony.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.771
He knows where to find me.

18:40.815 --> 18:43.122
If he wants to come back home,
he's got a key.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.036
So that's just it?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.474
For right now it is.Just like that?

18:47.517 --> 18:50.303
We're Trial Bureau,
not Family Court.

18:50.346 --> 18:53.349
So shall we?

19:07.407 --> 19:09.322
Luis Rosas.Yeah.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.411
Sergeant Reagan, NYPD.
You got a minute?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.847
Yes. For what?

19:12.890 --> 19:14.936
I want to ask you some questions
about Caitlin O'Brien.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.546
Is she okay?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.505
She's not in the hospital
or anything.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.420
Some compromising photos of her

19:20.463 --> 19:21.551
made their way onto
the Internet.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.726
You know anything about that?

19:22.770 --> 19:24.511
No, I don't.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.991
But she did send you
some photos?

19:27.035 --> 19:30.430
Yeah. We were hooking up,
and then we weren't.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.693
She sent me some nudes.

19:32.736 --> 19:35.130
Before or after
she broke up with you?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.828
Broke up with me?
She tell you that?

19:37.872 --> 19:40.004
Told my partner that, yeah.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.920
No. I called it off.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.661
She's a nice girl
and all, but...

19:44.705 --> 19:46.315
a little too intense for me.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.535
So maybe that's why
you posted the photos?

19:48.578 --> 19:50.319
Get rid of her
once and for all?
No, no.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.452
As soon as she sent me
those photos, I deleted them.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.802
What was the hurry?Are you kidding me?

19:54.845 --> 19:57.108
She's barely 16 and it's 2019.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.502
So would you be willing to
submit your phone to us

19:59.546 --> 20:00.721
for review?
Your computer, too?

20:00.764 --> 20:02.592
You want to look
through my phone?

20:02.636 --> 20:04.377
You say you got nothing to hide.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.292
You know what?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.511
I don't. Here.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.383
You can follow me home, too,

20:10.426 --> 20:11.601
take my computer.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.950
I'll just do my homework
on the house one.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.779
Look, Sergeant, really,
I got nothing to hide.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.264
I'll let you know if we need it.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.613
Thank you.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.719
ERIN:
Sam.

20:50.118 --> 20:53.252
You're killing him,
you know that?
Nah.

20:53.295 --> 20:54.949
Yeah.He was fine before me,

20:54.992 --> 20:57.343
which was, like,
99% of his life.

20:57.386 --> 21:00.520
You gave him purpose.
Everybody needs purpose.

21:00.563 --> 21:01.521
I don't.

21:01.564 --> 21:04.350
Everybody.
Especially you.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.655
I'm good.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.962
You're good? What's good?

21:08.005 --> 21:10.399
Just breathing, walking around?
Is that where your bar is set?

21:10.443 --> 21:13.097
I'm good setting my own bar.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.882
I don't want to be no cop.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.927
I don't think he cares
if you become a cop.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.538
I think he just wants you
to follow through

21:18.581 --> 21:19.495
with your commitments.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.410
His commitments.Okay.

21:21.454 --> 21:24.457
Just... just call him,
talk to him.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.067
Maybe there's a middle ground.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.460
Ms. Reagan,

21:27.503 --> 21:29.853
I appreciate what you're doing.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.856
And I really appreciate
everything Anthony tried to do,

21:32.900 --> 21:35.206
but let's get real.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.643
I think this is pretty real.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.514
Real stupid.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.560
You're running away from the one
person who wants to help you.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.605
This was never real.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.913
Me and him, father and son,
really?

21:45.956 --> 21:47.523
A black street kid
and a white cop?

21:47.567 --> 21:50.134
You paint us like a, like
a stray cat and a bulldog,

21:50.178 --> 21:52.746
like this is some kind
of old Disney movie.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.225
Those aren't real.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.319
[scoffs]

22:11.634 --> 22:13.549
GORMLEY:
Officer Russell.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.203
RUSSELL:
Lieutenant Gormley?Yeah.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.248
You got a second?Yes, sir.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.641
Here. Thanks.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.734
2015, you were partnered
with an Officer Rick Austin?

22:24.778 --> 22:27.389
Yes, sir. Until his injury
and subsequent retirement.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.738
Right. Can you tell me
what happened

22:28.782 --> 22:31.219
on the night of March 9th
of that year?

22:31.262 --> 22:32.960
It's all been
well-documented, sir.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.005
Yeah, but I'd like
to hear it from you.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.703
The night of.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.270
Again, I'm down verbatim
in the paperwork.

22:39.314 --> 22:42.665
I said... I'd like
to hear it from you.

22:44.319 --> 22:47.017
It's been four years,
so could I review the paperwork?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.410
Officer.

22:50.456 --> 22:51.718
Am I under oath here?

22:51.761 --> 22:54.155
You're answering
a higher-up's questions.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.375
Way higher up.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.467
Anything useful?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.773
Nothing on Winston yet.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.297
Why are you so sure
Winston's our guy?

23:06.341 --> 23:07.995
Well, not for nothing,
but he's accused

23:08.038 --> 23:09.692
of murdering
two different women.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.085
I'd say the odds
are pretty good.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.608
Yeah, the first one's
not our case.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.740
That doesn't make it irrelevant.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.264
Hold on.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.048
Look at this.

23:18.092 --> 23:22.618
Jane was a member of
a chat room, HelpAPrisoner.com.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.360
What, like, a community service?

23:26.405 --> 23:27.971
DANNY:
More like a dating service

23:28.015 --> 23:30.191
disguised as a community
service. Look at this.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.236
"Jane Miller, age 33,

23:32.280 --> 23:35.152
looking to meet a man
who knows what he wants."

23:35.196 --> 23:38.417
Why not eharmony
or one of those?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.027
You know what they say
about dating an inmate.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.681
Mm-hmm. They're always
where they said they were.

23:41.724 --> 23:42.638
Yep.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.640
DANNY:
Look at this.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.948
Winston had a profile?Yeah.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.297
And he messaged Jane

23:49.340 --> 23:51.821
six months before
she even took his case.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.475
They were involved?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.303
DANNY:
Unless she refers

23:55.346 --> 23:57.218
to all of her clients as "baby,"

23:57.261 --> 23:58.611
I'd say they were
definitely involved.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.439
Why wouldn't Winston
just mention that?

24:00.482 --> 24:01.570
Go ahead, say it.Say what?

24:01.614 --> 24:03.442
"Right again, Reagan."

24:11.537 --> 24:12.929
So why didn't you mention
that the two of you

24:12.973 --> 24:13.974
were in a relationship?

24:14.017 --> 24:15.845
We broke up.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.891
Who broke up with who?That don't matter.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.328
I'll decide what matters.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.114
It was mutual.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.768
It's never mutual,

24:25.812 --> 24:28.510
and you still haven't
answered the question.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.730
Why didn't you mention that you
two were in a relationship?!

24:30.773 --> 24:33.515
I-I... I knew it would
make me a suspect.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.648
Ah.All right, the-the cops didn't
believe me the last time,

24:35.691 --> 24:37.345
and they tricked me
into that confession.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.956
So you figured you'd lie
your way out of it this time?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.480
I was scared.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.785
Of course.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.700
Though I'm not sure
what you'd be scared of.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.441
I mean, dating is not illegal.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.574
Oh, right.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.577
You were scared
because murder's illegal.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.013
I didn't kill her!

24:55.058 --> 24:57.539
[sighs]

24:57.583 --> 24:59.672
Sit tight.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.545
Look it, he's gonna crack.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.938
Okay? I know it.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.636
I don't think so.What do you mean?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.771
Hate mail.
I got these from Green Haven.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.773
Apparently, the Lockharts
have sent threats

25:13.816 --> 25:15.775
to Winston's cell
almost daily.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.560
Well, of course they hate the
guy. He murdered their daughter.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.040
They think he did.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.608
Regardless, I'd hate him, too.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.653
They didn't just send
letters to Winston.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.437
What are you talking about?

25:26.481 --> 25:28.831
Richard Lockhart sent this
to Jane Miller

25:28.875 --> 25:30.616
after she won Winston's appeal.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.142
"You've put my wife and I
through hell,

25:35.185 --> 25:37.361
"which is exactly
where I intend to put you.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.102
Sincerely,
Richard Lockhart."

25:39.146 --> 25:40.582
It's explicit.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.236
Yeah, okay, it's explicit.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.064
And it could also

25:44.107 --> 25:46.675
just be a figure of speech.

25:54.509 --> 25:58.121
Hey. I don't think Luis Rosas
posted those pictures.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.514
Me, either.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.689
Based on?

26:00.733 --> 26:02.648
Talking to Caitlin.

26:02.691 --> 26:03.518
She told you that?

26:03.562 --> 26:06.086
Not in so many words.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.391
Then, in what words?

26:07.435 --> 26:08.784
So, if someone posts

26:08.828 --> 26:10.264
explicit photos of you

26:10.307 --> 26:12.962
and puts them on the Internet,
you want that person dead.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.703
And her vibe
was more like

26:14.747 --> 26:17.445
a mom going,
"He's such a nice boy."

26:17.488 --> 26:19.621
Then why give us Luis's name
to begin with?

26:19.665 --> 26:21.144
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.103
Maybe we should just send
this to Computer Crime

26:23.146 --> 26:24.757
like you wanted
and end this thing.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.193
No, no, no.
I think you were right.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.890
I don't think we should risk
sending some kid to jail

26:27.934 --> 26:29.675
until we know
what actually happened.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.720
Okay.Did Luis

26:31.764 --> 26:33.635
say anything about
his relationship with Caitlin?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.289
Just that she was
too intense for him

26:35.332 --> 26:36.769
and that's why
he broke up with her.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.771
And she said she dumped him.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.521
Sorry, I had to dot a couple
of I's. You ready for this?

26:50.565 --> 26:52.785
Ready for what?Don't kill
the messenger.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.656
I talked to Austin's
old partner.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.616
By talk, I mean I made him talk.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.662
"On the night of March 9, 2015,
Machete Guy, Manuel Escobar,

27:00.706 --> 27:02.403
"was apprehended

27:02.446 --> 27:05.406
"on the southbound subway
platform at 59th and Lex.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.452
Two officers received
lacerations in the struggle."

27:08.496 --> 27:10.454
GARRETT:
One of them Rick Austin?

27:10.498 --> 27:11.717
"At the same time,

27:11.760 --> 27:13.457
"rookie Officer Rick Austin
and his partner

27:13.501 --> 27:15.285
"were staking out
on the platform

27:15.329 --> 27:16.678
"on 51st
and Lexington,

27:16.722 --> 27:19.507
as part of the team
trying to nab Machete Guy."

27:19.550 --> 27:21.161
BAKER:
Wait, if Austin wasn't
on scene, then how...

27:22.466 --> 27:26.253
"Austin hid in the electrical
closet for his stakeout.

27:26.296 --> 27:28.037
"He tripped in the dark,

27:28.081 --> 27:30.474
"and the foiled-wrapped
sausage and peppers hero

27:30.518 --> 27:33.042
"he bought for a snack
came in contact

27:33.086 --> 27:38.526
with an exposed breaker socket,
vaporizing two of his fingers."

27:48.144 --> 27:50.712
My, oh, my.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.719
And they took him
to the same hospital

27:57.763 --> 27:59.503
as the other wounded cops.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.722
Bingo.GARRETT:
And somebody

28:00.766 --> 28:02.593
got the bright idea
to save this officer

28:02.637 --> 28:04.683
and this department
from the humiliation.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.728
And by the time Mayor
stopped by Austin's room

28:06.772 --> 28:09.296
to call him a hero
and take a picture with him,

28:09.339 --> 28:11.472
this thing was written in stone.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.831
[knocking on door]

28:22.875 --> 28:25.442
You know, you're the PC's
daughter, so any cop

28:25.486 --> 28:28.837
is gonna make like it's his
pleasure to drive you around

28:28.881 --> 28:30.056
looking for a
runaway kid.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.014
You realize
that, right?

28:32.058 --> 28:33.363
And I still have friends

28:33.407 --> 28:36.497
in a lot of the houses,
to answer your question.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.326
I was trying to help a friend
with a family matter.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.502
Yeah, well, it steps on a line.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.548
I see your point.

28:44.592 --> 28:47.464
And I appreciate the sentiment,
I really do.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.466
But this is my family matter.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.513
And single parents
need help sometimes.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.384
Yeah, and if they do,
they can ask for it.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.865
You know, you went through a lot
of tough stretches with Nicky.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.911
Did you ever see me,
uh, waylay her

28:58.954 --> 29:02.175
on the street for
a talking-to?

29:02.218 --> 29:05.482
You're absolutely right
and I apologize.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.752
Anyway, how was he?

29:15.623 --> 29:18.582
Ten toes, ten fingers,
if that's what you mean.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.671
He's a tough kid.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.632
Well, thanks for hearing me out.

29:24.675 --> 29:27.940
Did he say that
he wouldn't take the test

29:27.983 --> 29:30.333
or couldn't?

29:31.987 --> 29:33.989
I honestly don't know.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.954
And of all the things I don't
get about the young people,

29:41.997 --> 29:43.825
that's the one
I don't get the most.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.261
I'm with you for once.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.393
For once?

29:46.436 --> 29:47.524
SEAN:
It's not like
she meant

29:47.568 --> 29:49.613
for the pictures to go public.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.006
Yeah, but the fact
is, she's the one

29:51.050 --> 29:52.616
that put the pictures
out there in the first place.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.922
Yeah.And if she hadn't,

29:53.966 --> 29:54.967
there wouldn't be any pictures
of her out there.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.969
Back in the day,
the girl next door

29:57.012 --> 29:59.536
wanted to show everyone her
assets, they did it in Playboy.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.625
Yeah, but she wasn't really
the girl next door

30:01.669 --> 30:03.453
unless you were living
next to a modeling agency.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.585
Beg to differ.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.501
"Girls of the Big Ten,"
actual students.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.417
Apparently,
Dad looked that one up.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.549
I guess so.[soft laughter]

30:14.682 --> 30:16.684
JANKO:
Well, a guy falls
in love with a girl,

30:16.727 --> 30:20.427
and he finds out that she has
nude photos of her out there

30:20.470 --> 30:22.516
in the world for
everyone to see.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.778
That guy took a
punch in the gut.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.345
HENRY:
True.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.869
Especially if it's, like,
his first big love or something.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.872
That sucks for both of them.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.918
Thing I don't understand
is why are people so willing

30:32.961 --> 30:34.397
to give up their privacy?

30:34.441 --> 30:35.442
Maybe she has
a different definition

30:35.485 --> 30:36.965
of privacy than you do.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.184
Well, what's more private
than naked pictures of yourself?

30:38.227 --> 30:39.663
HENRY [laughs]:
Yeah.

30:39.707 --> 30:43.711
There's this girl at school,
she's sexted, like, 20 guys.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.844
Nude selfies, too.
[groans]

30:46.932 --> 30:49.891
Her dad hits her.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.937
You're saying she does it
because her dad hits her?

30:51.980 --> 30:53.199
SEAN:
Well,

30:53.242 --> 30:55.505
if anybody finds out
that her dad hits her,

30:55.549 --> 30:58.900
that's what she would
be really mortified by.

30:58.944 --> 31:03.122
The pictures are, like, her way
of getting back at her father.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.994
Wow.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.648
And you know this how?She talks to me.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.302
Before you ask,

31:09.345 --> 31:11.304
no, I haven't looked
at the pictures.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.045
Maybe that's why
she talks to you.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.699
Guy who wrote, uh,
Hundred Years of Solitude...

31:15.743 --> 31:17.484
Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.572
Thank you.

31:18.615 --> 31:21.662
He said,
"Everyone has three lives:

31:21.705 --> 31:25.231
a public one, a private one,
and a secret one."

31:25.274 --> 31:26.754
Mm.

31:26.797 --> 31:29.626
I always thought that should be
taught at the Academy.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.498
Useful for cops
looking for motive.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.716
Or for the victim

31:32.760 --> 31:34.588
in your complaint.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.591
Or for understanding
your friend.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.898
Or maybe we should go back
to just locking the doors

31:39.941 --> 31:42.726
and pulling down the blinds.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.479
Hey, Sam.

32:00.831 --> 32:02.964
[indistinct chatter]

32:03.008 --> 32:04.313
Hey.

32:04.357 --> 32:07.229
Do me one favor.If I can.

32:07.273 --> 32:09.362
I'm not here to try to make you
come back, I promise.

32:11.799 --> 32:14.541
Open this to anywhere,
read me a paragraph.

32:14.584 --> 32:17.239
Sports recap,
anything you like.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.461
'Cause you won't or
'cause you can't?

32:21.504 --> 32:24.420
I can read part of it,
it-it just takes me forever.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
Look, we can get help for that.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.597
But you got to want it.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.992
I know I'm supposed
to, I just...

32:31.036 --> 32:32.602
I got enough things
that I fail at.

32:34.517 --> 32:35.649
Can I get back to my boys?

32:35.692 --> 32:39.174
Sure. Can I get my keys back?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.176
[keys jangle]

32:41.220 --> 32:43.222
Okay?

32:44.614 --> 32:48.096
Look, I want to be
a good father--

32:48.140 --> 32:50.969
good foster dad to you,
but forcing it on you

32:51.012 --> 32:52.405
isn't gonna make me one.

32:52.448 --> 32:55.495
All I know to say
is that,

32:55.538 --> 32:57.366
if you need my help...

32:58.977 --> 33:00.630
...you know where to find me.

33:02.371 --> 33:03.633
Thanks.

33:31.487 --> 33:34.012
So, what happens now?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.361
JANKO:
We're gonna ask
Computer Crime

33:35.404 --> 33:38.407
to trace the IP, in which case,

33:38.451 --> 33:40.496
it could get bumped up
to a felony.Thank you.

33:40.540 --> 33:43.021
What-what exactly
does that mean?

33:43.064 --> 33:44.326
Prison time,
most likely.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.328
How much depends
on what the D.A. charges.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.503
For who?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.331
For Luis, for one.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.986
We're not letting this go,
Caitlin. I told you...

33:52.030 --> 33:53.640
Dad, please.

33:53.683 --> 33:56.251
That isn't fair.Why isn't it fair?

33:56.295 --> 33:57.339
It just isn't.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.735
If you know
something else,

34:01.778 --> 34:03.563
we strongly suggest
you share it.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.565
Yeah, as is, we can
still help you.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.088
If this goes
any further...

34:07.132 --> 34:08.481
CONNOR:
He's got it
coming to him.

34:08.524 --> 34:09.525
What he did to you...

34:09.569 --> 34:12.050
What Idid to me.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.138
What?

34:13.181 --> 34:16.750
I posted the pictures, Dad.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.273
Okay?

34:22.103 --> 34:23.887
Why did you do that?

34:23.931 --> 34:26.586
Because he broke my heart.

34:26.629 --> 34:27.674
I wanted to get him back.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.371
By letting the world
see you naked?

34:29.415 --> 34:31.721
By letting the world think
he was that kind of guy.

34:31.765 --> 34:35.551
So you wanted to ruin his life?[quietly]: No, no.

34:35.595 --> 34:37.945
I just wanted him
to feel alone, too.

34:37.988 --> 34:42.167
I swear, I didn't mean
for it to get this big.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.648
I thought he would get grounded
or suspended, not go to jail.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.476
You lied to everyone!

34:47.520 --> 34:49.522
And youwent to the police,
and here we are.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.525
Do I need to get
a lawyer?

34:52.568 --> 34:55.136
I think we can handle this
outside of court.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.530
Really?

34:57.573 --> 34:59.619
Yeah, you just need to agree
to a couple things:

34:59.662 --> 35:00.576
counseling, for one.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.144
Anything.And...

35:03.188 --> 35:05.494
you need to set this straight
with Luis.

35:05.538 --> 35:09.368
And everyone who thinks
he did this to you.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.586
Got that?

35:25.253 --> 35:26.385
Mr. O'Brien?

35:26.428 --> 35:29.475
Your daughter hasn't been
this vulnerable

35:29.518 --> 35:31.520
since the day she was born.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.826
Your instinct in

35:32.869 --> 35:37.396
going to Sergeant Reagan
was to protect her.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.659
She needs that protection
from you,

35:39.702 --> 35:42.662
now more than ever.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.157
Richard should be back
any minute.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.724
You really don't need
to wait on us like this.

36:01.768 --> 36:03.639
It's the least
I could do.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.729
I hope you're able
to get justice

36:06.773 --> 36:08.296
for our Leah.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.733
The detectives are getting
close to making an arrest.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.910
You mean nailing
Winston Hill?
No.

36:13.954 --> 36:17.566
It wasn't Winston who
killed your daughter.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.744
Mrs. Lockhart, wh-where
is your husband?

36:26.749 --> 36:29.056
Mrs. Lockhart.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.536
Your husband,
where is he?

36:30.579 --> 36:33.626
He said he was gonna finish
what you all couldn't.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.323
Winston?

36:35.367 --> 36:36.716
Yes.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.761
Let's go.

36:57.476 --> 36:58.694
Richard!

36:58.738 --> 36:59.869
Hey!

37:02.350 --> 37:04.439
You don't want
to do this.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.879
You don't know anything
about what I want.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.408
Yes, I do.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.368
I know you already
made one big mistake

37:20.412 --> 37:22.414
when you killed Jane Miller.

37:25.504 --> 37:29.421
Now they may see it as an
extreme emotional disturbance.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.423
But you do it again,
that's your life.

37:35.905 --> 37:38.125
He can't just run free!

37:38.168 --> 37:39.909
Winston didn't do it.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.393
What?

37:45.437 --> 37:47.134
He didn't.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.919
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

37:49.963 --> 37:51.312
Come on.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.401
[siren approaching]

37:57.405 --> 37:59.712
Hands against the car.
Come on.

38:00.756 --> 38:03.063
Gun.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.898
Go ahead.It's your turn now.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.465
My turn for what?

38:13.508 --> 38:15.031
Say it.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.947
You were right.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.515
It doesn't feel so good
this time.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.474
No, it doesn't.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.519
[indistinct chatter]

38:40.970 --> 38:42.537
[exhales]

38:42.581 --> 38:44.147
[clears throat]

38:44.191 --> 38:45.410
[knocking on door]

38:45.453 --> 38:48.413
I go on eight minutes
past the hour, thank you.

38:54.027 --> 38:57.596
[chuckles]
It's not really
a good time, sir.

38:57.639 --> 39:00.512
No time like the present,
Officer Sparky.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.299
Ring a bell?

39:10.696 --> 39:12.611
They really call you that?

39:12.654 --> 39:14.395
Oh, yeah,
the douchebags did.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.270
So, here's the deal, Sparky.

39:20.314 --> 39:23.926
If I expose you,

39:23.970 --> 39:25.580
a whole bunch of smart people

39:25.624 --> 39:28.278
in my department,
not to mention some in city hall

39:28.322 --> 39:30.803
and one of our best hospitals,

39:30.846 --> 39:33.414
they all look like clowns.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.633
So there's that.

39:36.286 --> 39:38.506
Plus, you were actually injured

39:38.550 --> 39:39.681
in the line of duty,

39:39.725 --> 39:43.859
although by
a sausage and pepper hero,

39:43.903 --> 39:46.166
so there's that.

39:46.209 --> 39:49.778
[sighs] Yes.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.174
You keep the secret,
you keep your pension.

39:55.871 --> 39:59.527
As long as you deduct
your earnings against it.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.878
Okay.

40:02.922 --> 40:06.665
If you spill the beans...

40:06.708 --> 40:08.057
all bets are off.

40:08.101 --> 40:10.582
And we pursue fraud charges.

40:12.845 --> 40:16.718
And... as of right now,

40:16.762 --> 40:21.462
you stop talking down the NYPD
in your act.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.377
Wait-- whoa, hold on,
I'm about to go on.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.639
I-I... I can't change
the whole thing

40:24.683 --> 40:26.249
in the next two minutes.

40:26.293 --> 40:30.123
Hey, you improvised your way
out of an assault by a sandwich.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.386
I have faith in you.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.741
The biggest scam you're running

40:39.785 --> 40:44.485
is that the NYPD
doesn't take care of its own.

40:44.529 --> 40:48.620
You have been the beneficiary
of more solidarity,

40:48.663 --> 40:52.232
more protection, more loyalty,

40:52.275 --> 40:54.887
from our brotherhood of blue

40:54.930 --> 40:59.195
than any officer
I have ever known.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.160
You realize that?

41:08.770 --> 41:10.598
You, uh...
[clears throat]

41:10.642 --> 41:12.470
put it like that, yeah.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.566
So thank you for your service.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.663
And cut the crap.
