WEBVTT

00:11.179 --> 00:13.314

TURNED CARLOS INTO A LOG?

00:14.415 --> 00:15.949
KEEP ROLLING!

00:15.949 --> 00:18.486
THEY CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING
WITHOUT A BODY.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.654

00:20.654 --> 00:21.722

00:23.357 --> 00:24.525

[record scratches]

00:26.527 --> 00:28.129

00:30.231 --> 00:34.102
YOU'RE IN NEW ZEALAND
FILMING A MOVIE--

00:34.102 --> 00:35.469
THREE MOVIES.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.471
- WELL, THE STUDIO TESTED
THE FIRST FILM,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.741
AND THE TEST AUDIENCE HATED IT,
THEN BURNED DOWN THE THEATER.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.310
THEN THE STUDIO CANCELED
THE SEQUELS,

00:42.310 --> 00:44.112
AND THEN I CAME HERE.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.848

[laughs]

00:47.848 --> 00:49.150
HI.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.218

00:50.218 --> 00:51.819

00:55.823 --> 00:56.857

00:59.660 --> 01:00.794
UH...

01:05.799 --> 01:08.001

01:11.805 --> 01:13.641
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:13.641 --> 01:17.778
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME

01:17.778 --> 01:19.647

WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:19.647 --> 01:21.615
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:21.615 --> 01:24.918
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME

01:24.918 --> 01:25.919
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:25.919 --> 01:27.888
- * HEY, HEY

01:29.990 --> 01:31.992

01:31.992 --> 01:33.727

01:33.727 --> 01:35.229
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:35.229 --> 01:37.731
* OH-OH, OH-OH

01:37.731 --> 01:38.832

01:38.832 --> 01:41.569

01:42.936 --> 01:45.306

01:45.306 --> 01:48.976
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:48.976 --> 01:53.614
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

01:57.851 --> 01:59.487
- SO YOU GET THAT DATE
WITH LUCY?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.994
- GUESS WHAT WAS BANNED
IN ALL 50 STATES

02:06.994 --> 02:09.463
BUT I GOT THE LAST
TWO BOTTLES OF.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.631
- PLEASE DON'T SHOW US.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.833
- ZOM-B-GONE.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.101
- TELL ME YOU DIDN'T BUY THAT

02:14.101 --> 02:15.969
FROM THAT STUPID LATE-NIGHT
COMMERCIAL.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.671
- ZOM-B-GONE, THE ONLY DRINK
THAT GIVES YOU

02:17.671 --> 02:19.407
COMPLETE IMMUNITY
FROM ZOMBIE ATTACKS.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.342
DON'T GET EATEN.
GET ZOM-B-GONE.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.810
RESULTS MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.945
[both groaning and moaning]

02:24.945 --> 02:26.380
- GO AHEAD.
MOCK.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.682
BUT WHEN THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE
HITS,

02:28.682 --> 02:31.118
STAY AWAY FROM MY ZOM-B-GONE.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.122
- I'M NOT HERE.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.090
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ME.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.559
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.594
- HEY, GUYS.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.629
both: JO.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.930
- YOU'RE BACK!

02:42.930 --> 02:46.267
- I'M LOOKING FOR KENDALL.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.635
- HE'S NOT HERE.
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.303
- WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
- MM-HMM.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.671
- OH, OKAY.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.907
WELL, IF YOU SEE HIM,
TELL HIM I'M AROUND.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.343
- OF COURSE, YEAH.
- SURE.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.810
- SEE YOU LATER.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.649
- I GOT PROBLEMS.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.852
- HEY.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.254
- HEY!

03:06.254 --> 03:08.856
NOW...GO AWAY.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.857
- GREAT.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.124
JUST SIGN THIS FORM
SAYING THAT

03:11.124 --> 03:12.393
I WORKED HERE
FOR THREE HOURS

03:12.393 --> 03:14.462
AND LEARNED
ABOUT THE RECORD INDUSTRY.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.929
- FINE.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.731
WAIT, DOESN'T THIS MEAN

03:17.731 --> 03:20.468
THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR ME
FOR THREE HOURS,

03:20.468 --> 03:22.770
OR YOU DON'T GET
SCHOOL CREDIT?

03:22.770 --> 03:26.039
- IN THEORY, BUT I ALREADY KNOW
ALL ABOUT THE RECORD INDUSTRY.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.074
- OH, REALLY?

03:27.074 --> 03:28.276
WELL, THEN, YOU WOULD KNOW

03:28.276 --> 03:30.611
THAT LESSON NUMBER ONE
OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

03:30.611 --> 03:33.347
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET ME
GINGERSNAP-SNAPS,

03:33.347 --> 03:36.284
OR I'M NOT GONNA SIGN
YOUR SHEET-SHEET.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.118
[chuckling]
POWER!

03:38.118 --> 03:41.822
- GUSTAVO, I COULDN'T HELP
NOTICING THAT I NEED MORE MONEY.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.091
SO WHERE'S MY NEXT BTR ALBUM?

03:44.091 --> 03:47.628
- AH, YOU KNOW, GRIFFIN,
MAKING AN ALBUM TAKES TIME.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.297
- BUT WE ARE PICKING DEMOS,

03:49.297 --> 03:52.132
AND WE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING
READY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.302
- NOW I CAN'T HELP NOTICING
THAT I'M SAD.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.839
- JUST RELEASE A DIGIPAK
OF REMIXES.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.041
HIRE A GUEST DJ
TO REWORK SOME CLASSICS,

04:01.041 --> 04:03.577
THROW IN ONE NEW SINGLE,
AND YOU'LL BE SEEING NEW PROFITS

04:03.577 --> 04:05.313
IN LESS THAN THREE WEEKS.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.881
- KATIE, I'M PUTTING YOU
IN CHARGE OF ROQUE RECORDS.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.816
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

04:08.816 --> 04:09.950
- WHAT?

04:09.950 --> 04:12.152
- GRIFFIN, SHE'S
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.221
- WHICH MEANS SHE'S YOUNG,
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOUTH

04:14.221 --> 04:16.990
IS WHAT DRIVES THE YOUTH-DRIVEN
MUSIC BUSINESS.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.627
- YOU CAN'T PUT HER
IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.829
- BUT I JUST DID.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.896
HA-HA-HA-HA.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.398
POWER!

04:24.398 --> 04:25.699
- NOT HERE.
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.234
DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.870
- WELL, LET HIM KNOW
WE NEED TO TALK...

04:29.870 --> 04:32.340
ABOUT JO AND STUFF.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.877
- [exhaling]

04:36.877 --> 04:39.813
OKAY, YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
JUST HIDE FROM YOUR PROBLEMS.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.751
- YES, I CAN.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.752
- AHA!

04:44.752 --> 04:46.354
I KNEW YOU WERE IN HERE!

04:46.354 --> 04:48.989
HOW COULD YOU AVOID JO,
WHO YOU DATED,

04:48.989 --> 04:51.058
AND LUCY,
WHO YOU JUST STARTED DATING,

04:51.058 --> 04:52.660
BUT JO CAME BACK
AND SAW YOU KISSING LUCY,

04:52.660 --> 04:54.462
WHO YOU DON'T KNOW
AS WELL AS JO,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.997
WHO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WAS COMING BACK, AND...

04:56.997 --> 04:59.367
WOW.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.934
NO WONDER
YOU'RE AVOIDING THEM.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.269
- AND CONFUSED.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.204
YOU FORGOT CONFUSED.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.040
- WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT YOUR PROBLEM.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.742
LIKE, DOES JO EVEN WANT
TO TAKE YOU BACK?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.544
- SHE DOES.
SHE TOLD ME.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.712
- SHE DOES?
- MM-HMM.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.481
- OKAY, THAT.
BUT DO YOU STILL LIKE JO?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.749
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN APART
FOR A LONG TIME,

05:15.749 --> 05:17.951
AND YOU REALLY LIKE LUCY.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.753
- I HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

05:19.753 --> 05:24.091
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW
IF I STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR JO.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.860
- OKAY, WELL, THEN,
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.295
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.164
IMAGINE YOU AND JO ARE RUNNING
THROUGH FIELDS OF FLOWERS...

05:31.164 --> 05:32.466
- YEAH, I STILL LIKE HER.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.070
[yelling and crashing]

05:39.206 --> 05:40.974
- [grunting]

05:40.974 --> 05:42.610
THAT MOUSE IS SMART.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.777
REAL SMART.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.415
- JUST CATCH IT
BEFORE PEOPLE SEE IT.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.254
WHAT?

05:54.254 --> 05:55.423
- I WOULD LIKE TO STORE

05:55.423 --> 05:56.924
THE LAST TWO BOTTLES
OF ZOM-B-GONE

05:56.924 --> 05:59.026
IN THE PALMWOODS SAFE.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.928
- YOU BOUGHT ZOM-B-GONE?

06:00.928 --> 06:03.797
- ZOM-B-GONE, COMES IN LICORICE,
CORN, AND GREEN FLAVOR.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.798
ORDER NOW.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.600
- WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.437
- [grunting] ACTUALLY,
NORWEGIAN SCIENTISTS THEORIZE

06:09.437 --> 06:11.004
THAT WITH THE RISE
IN DIRT TOXINS

06:11.004 --> 06:13.741
AND GLOBAL ZOOMING,
THERE'S A 79% CHANCE

06:13.741 --> 06:14.808
OF A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE

06:14.808 --> 06:18.211
OCCURRING IN THE NEXT
17 FERMAHERBITS.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.447
- HOW LONG IS THAT?

06:19.447 --> 06:22.450
- I THINK IT'S, LIKE, SOON.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.317
- I'LL GIVE YOU 50 BUCKS
FOR ONE BOTTLE

06:24.317 --> 06:28.489
AND FREE STORAGE FOR YOURS
AND MY ZOM-B-GONE.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.590
- SHOW ME THE MONEY.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.625
- I HAVE TO GO TO AN ATM.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.495
DON'T SELL IT TO ANYBODY
WHILE I'M GONE!

06:34.495 --> 06:35.829
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

06:35.829 --> 06:39.232
- I JUST SOLD MY EXTRA BOTTLE
OF ZOM-B-GONE TO BITTERS

06:39.232 --> 06:42.002
FOR--GUESS WHAT--
50 BUCKS!

06:42.002 --> 06:43.471
NOW WHO'S CRAZY?

06:43.471 --> 06:44.672
WHOO!

06:55.649 --> 06:57.284
- WHERE ARE MY MUSIC AWARDS?

06:57.284 --> 06:58.351
- WHERE'S MY SONG?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.087
- IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

07:00.087 --> 07:01.889
GRIFFIN IS NUTS.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.223
AND THE MINUTE HE REALIZES

07:03.223 --> 07:04.958
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.394
HE'S GONNA FIRE YOU
AND HIRE ME BACK,

07:07.394 --> 07:09.997
AND THEN I WILL LAUGH--
HA-HA-HA-HA--

07:09.997 --> 07:13.233
AND THEN YOU WILL BE BANNED
FROM ROQUE RECORDS FOREVER.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.035
- KATIE,
JUST GIVE THIS UP NOW.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.171
YOU ARE IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.340
- GREAT NEWS, EVERYONE.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.175
KATIE JUST LICENSED BTR MUSIC

07:22.175 --> 07:23.911
TO THE NEW BATTLE BLAST
VIDEO GAME

07:23.911 --> 07:27.715
AND MADE US $1.2 MILLION.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.349
- IT WAS NOTHING, GRIFFIN.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.350
JUICE BOX?

07:30.350 --> 07:32.352
- UH, WELL...

07:34.522 --> 07:36.189
IT'S 5:00 SOMEWHERE.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.528
- OKAY.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.630
SO WE NOW KNOW YOUR PROBLEM.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.797
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.300
- DO YOU STAY WITH LUCY
OR GET BACK WITH JO?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.436
- AND HOW DO WE SOLVE
THESE PROBLEMS?

07:49.436 --> 07:51.104
- YOU RUN FROM THEM.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.373
- NO.
YOU CONFRONT THEM...

07:53.373 --> 07:54.542
HEAD-ON.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.145
- RIGHT.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.613
I'M GONNA FIND JO AND LUCY

07:59.613 --> 08:02.449
AND DISCUSS THIS SITUATION
LIKE AN ADULT.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.585
I AM CONFRONTING MY PROBLEM.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.923
AND NOW I'M TURNING AROUND.

08:09.923 --> 08:10.891
[gasps]

08:12.560 --> 08:13.961
MM-UH...

08:16.764 --> 08:17.765
[sighs]

08:17.765 --> 08:19.199
[knife clashes]
- HEY!

08:19.199 --> 08:20.601
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

08:22.970 --> 08:23.971
- SO, CARLOS...

08:23.971 --> 08:24.972
- OH!

08:24.972 --> 08:26.139
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,

08:26.139 --> 08:27.708
AND I'VE DECIDED
THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE ME

08:27.708 --> 08:29.209
YOUR EXTRA BOTTLE
OF ZOM-B-GONE.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.443
- BUT YOU SAID IT WAS STUPID.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.979
- IT PROBABLY IS,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.413
BUT HOW DARE YOU
GIVE IT TO BITTERS

08:33.413 --> 08:34.848
INSTEAD OF YOUR BEST FRIEND,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.084
WHO, AGAIN,
WILL PROBABLY NEVER NEED IT?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.052
- BUT BITTERS IS GIVING ME
50 BUCKS FOR IT.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.089
- THIS WILL NOT LOOK GOOD
WITH ROTTING FLESH.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.257
- I'M BACK.
GIVE ME THE BOTTLE.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.659
- BACK OFF, ZOMBIE LUNCH.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.727
IT'S MINE.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.161
- BUT WE HAD A DEAL.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.598
- AH, DEAL SCHMEAL.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.232
- BUT I WENT
ALL THE WAY TO THE ATM.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.234
- BUT I WENT ALL THE WAY--
IT'S MINE.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.402
- GIVE IT TO ME.
- GIVE IT TO ME.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.503
- GIVE IT TO ME.
- TO ME.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.938
- GIVE IT TO ME.
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.140
- NO, GIVE IT TO ME.
GIVE IT TO ME.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.109
- WOW, KENDALL.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.345
JO AND LUCY BOTH SOUND LIKE
AMAZING GIRLS.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.615
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.984
- YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDMA USED TO SAY,

09:10.984 --> 09:14.387
99% OF PROBLEMS
GO AWAY BY THEMSELVES.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.691
- THEY JUST
GO AWAY BY THEMSELVES?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.259
- BY THEMSELVES.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.494
- THEY JUST GO AWAY?

09:21.494 --> 09:23.330
- JUST GO AWAY.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.835
- PROBLEMS JUST GO AWAY.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.803
- YOU'RE GOING AWAY?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.204
- LOOK...

09:31.204 --> 09:33.473
I'LL UNDERSTAND
IF HE WANTS TO GET BACK WITH JO,

09:33.473 --> 09:35.709
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND
TO SEE IT.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.077
IF I DON'T HEAR FROM HIM
BY TONIGHT,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.979
I'M GONNA SAVE MYSELF
THE BROKEN HEART

09:38.979 --> 09:41.148
AND LEAVE THE PALMWOODS.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.986
[sighing]

09:49.256 --> 09:50.758
- SHE'S LEAVING THE PALMWOODS?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.159
- IT'S BAD!

09:52.159 --> 09:55.362
[knocking]

09:55.362 --> 09:56.396
- IT'S JO!

09:56.396 --> 09:57.364
both: LOCKER!

10:02.035 --> 10:03.470
- HEY!

10:03.470 --> 10:06.740
both: SORRY.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.008
- [sighs]

10:08.008 --> 10:09.376
I GUESS I MADE A MISTAKE,

10:09.376 --> 10:11.645
THINKING WE COULD JUST PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.748
JUST TELL KENDALL, IF I DON'T
HEAR FROM HIM BY TONIGHT,

10:14.748 --> 10:17.284
THEN I'M GONNA
LEAVE THE PALMWOODS.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.418
[locker banging]

10:18.418 --> 10:20.020
- UH...
[clears throat]

10:26.860 --> 10:28.528
- OKAY, YOU'RE HIDING
FROM YOUR PROBLEMS AGAIN.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.297
- YEAH, AND IF I DON'T
MAKE UP MY MIND TODAY

10:30.297 --> 10:31.598
AND PICK JO OR LUCY,

10:31.598 --> 10:33.867
THEY'RE BOTH GONNA
LEAVE THE PALMWOODS.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.402
- JUST CHOOSE
WHO YOU LIKE BETTER

10:35.402 --> 10:36.970
AND GO KNOCK ON HER DOOR.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.175
- I DON'T KNOW
WHICH DOOR TO KNOCK ON.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.379
I MEAN, JO IS AMAZING,
BUT SHE'S AN ACTRESS,

10:46.379 --> 10:48.716
AND WHO'S TO SAY
THAT SHE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE AGAIN

10:48.716 --> 10:49.917
FOR ANOTHER BIG MOVIE?

10:49.917 --> 10:51.318
AND LUCY'S AMAZING TOO,

10:51.318 --> 10:54.621
BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING
FOR 96 MINUTES.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.289
- MM.
- OKAY.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.291
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM,

10:58.291 --> 11:00.427
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO HERE,
BECAUSE IT'S A LITTLE EXTREME,

11:00.427 --> 11:02.930
BUT YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO
EVERYTHING I SAY

11:02.930 --> 11:05.398
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS HOW IT WORKS.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.900
- PLEASE DON'T SAY
LOVE SCIENCE.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.035
- LOVE SCIENCE!

11:11.772 --> 11:12.906
ALL RIGHT!

11:12.906 --> 11:14.607
THIS IS GONNA WORK GREAT.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.343
[electricity zapping]

11:16.343 --> 11:17.477
- WAIT.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.280
THIS ISN'T HOW YOU PICKED ME,
IS IT?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.882
- WHAT?
NO.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.283
[mouthing words]

11:24.651 --> 11:28.021
[men shouting,
glass breaking]

11:28.021 --> 11:29.556
[cat yowling]

11:29.556 --> 11:30.590
[girls screaming]

11:30.590 --> 11:32.425
- I GOT SMARTIE MOUSE!

11:32.425 --> 11:34.094
HA-HA!
OOH!

11:34.094 --> 11:35.328
HE'S ALSO KIND OF CUTE.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.231
[gasps]
I'M GONNA CALL YOU "BRAINS."

11:38.231 --> 11:39.199
HI, BRAINS.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.568
- NO, WE HAD A DEAL!
- DEAL SCHMEAL!

11:41.568 --> 11:42.635
- GUYS!

11:42.635 --> 11:44.471
IT'S A BIG DECISION, OKAY?

11:44.471 --> 11:45.839
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU

11:45.839 --> 11:48.976
CAN HAVE MY EXTRA BOTTLE
OF ZOM-B-GONE.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.811
- ZOM-B-GONE,
YOU KNOW IT WORKS

11:50.811 --> 11:52.412
'CAUSE IT SAYS SO
ON THE LABEL.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.182
- THEN THINK OF IT THIS WAY.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.917
WHO DO YOU WANT
TO BE BY YOUR SIDE

11:56.917 --> 11:58.518
DURING A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE?

11:58.518 --> 12:02.022
ME, YOUR BEST FRIEND EVER,
WHO HAS A PROTECTIVE NATURE,

12:02.022 --> 12:04.257
OR A SLACKING HOTEL MANAGER

12:04.257 --> 12:06.794
WHO ONLY EVER LOOKS OUT
FOR HIMSELF?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.898
- I THINK HE WANTS ME...

12:10.898 --> 12:13.200
AND MY GOOD FRIEND
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.268
- [squeals]
THAT'S UNFAIR.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.870
- I DO LIKE BEN.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.205
- MM-HMM.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.706
- BUT JAMES IS RIGHT.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.541
WHO WILL FIGHT BEST
BY MY SIDE

12:21.541 --> 12:23.476
WHEN THE UNDEAD INVADE?

12:25.545 --> 12:27.047
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.549
- PLEASE DON'T SAY
ZOMBIE APOCA-LYMPICS.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.952
- THE ZOMBIE APOCA-LYMPICS!

12:36.256 --> 12:39.326
- CAN I GET ANOTHER JUICE BOX?

12:39.326 --> 12:40.928
YOU WANT SOMETHING
DONE RIGHT,

12:40.928 --> 12:42.095
YOU GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.504
- LOOKS LIKE BOSS LADY DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY

12:51.504 --> 12:53.941
THAT LEADS
RIGHT TO HER OFFICE.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.743
AND NOW TO FIND THE EVIDENCE
THAT WILL PROVE TO GRIFFIN

12:56.743 --> 12:59.847
THAT SHE HAS NO IDEA
HOW TO RUN A RECORD COMPANY.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.751
"KATIE'S Q3 OBJECTIVES:

13:04.751 --> 13:07.921
"INCREASE PROFITS
BY DIVERSIFYING FOREIGN ASSETS

13:07.921 --> 13:10.323
AND RESTRUCTURING
SUBSIDIARY DEBT."

13:10.323 --> 13:11.458
BORING!

13:11.458 --> 13:13.560
"INSTALL SOLAR-POWERED TOILETS"?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.328
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

13:15.328 --> 13:19.867
"BOOK BTR FOR BIRTHDAY PARTIES
TO MAKE EXTRA CASH."

13:19.867 --> 13:21.001
AHA!

13:21.001 --> 13:25.138
[laughing maniacally]

13:25.138 --> 13:27.107
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR NEW COMPANY PRESIDENT

13:27.107 --> 13:29.609
IS ABOUT TO DESTROY
BIG TIME RUSH'S IMAGE

13:29.609 --> 13:32.112
AND PROFIT SHARING STUFF

13:32.112 --> 13:35.883
BY BOOKING THEM FOR LITTLE
KIDDIE BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.885
FIRE WHEN READY, GRIFFIN.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.652
- KATIE, IS THIS TRUE?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.188
- YEP.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.589
I BOOKED BTR TO PLAY

13:42.589 --> 13:44.892
THE SULTAN OF CYDONIA'S
DAUGHTER'S SWEET 16 PARTY

13:44.892 --> 13:46.793
FOR $2 MILLION...

13:49.362 --> 13:50.530
AND A TANK.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.664
- A-SHINK!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.600
- A-SHINK INDEED,
GUSTAVO.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.368
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,
KATIE.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.104
I HAVE A TANK TO DRIVE.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.546
- NOW, EMOTIONS CAN BE
DECEPTIVE AND CONFUSING.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.216
BUT HEART RATE, BRAIN WAVES,

14:09.216 --> 14:10.918
AND SWEAT LEVELS CANNOT.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.786
NOW, CAMILLE WILL BRING BOTH
LUCY AND JO OUT BY THE POOL.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.522
YOU WILL OBSERVE SAID GIRLS,

14:15.522 --> 14:16.789
AND I WILL CALCULATE
ALL DATA

14:16.789 --> 14:19.826
TO DETERMINE
WHICH GIRL YOU LIKE BETTER.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.461
- CAMILLE, WHAT ARE WE DOING?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.230
- YOU NEED TO GET
YOUR MIND OFF KENDALL,

14:23.230 --> 14:28.735
WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE TO SEE
THE RARE ALBINO COCONUT.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.270
[electronic beeping]

14:30.270 --> 14:32.205
- OKAY, DATA COMING IN.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.542
OKAY, 94 BPMs.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.944
CARRY THE TWO...

14:36.944 --> 14:38.845
JO GOT A TEN.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.113
- TOLD YOU IT WAS COOL.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.481
YOU SHOULD GET A SMOOTHIE.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.084
- OH, OKAY.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.252
- AND NOW FOR LUCY.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.421
- CAMILLE,
AN ALBINO COCONUT

14:48.421 --> 14:50.257
IS NOT GONNA HELP ME
GET MY MIND OFF KENDALL.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.324
- UH, YEAH, IT WILL.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.425
IT'S REALLY COOL.

14:56.796 --> 15:00.600
- 120 OVER 80
DIVIDED BY 72 CVMs.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.504
LUCY GOT A TEN TOO.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.239
- THEY BOTH GOT TENS?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.075
- UH...

15:08.075 --> 15:10.577
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.513
N-NO, SHE GOT AN 11...

15:13.513 --> 15:15.515
20?

15:15.515 --> 15:16.683
- SHE SEES ME.
- OH!

15:18.518 --> 15:20.120
HEART ZONE REACHING
DANGEROUS LEVELS.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.691
- NOW JO SEES ME!

15:24.691 --> 15:26.526
- GOD!
IT'S TOO MUCH LOVE SCIENCE!

15:26.526 --> 15:27.560
[beeping]

15:27.560 --> 15:28.761
- WHAT DO I DO?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.198
- CALCULATE THE MARGIN INTO...

15:31.198 --> 15:33.133
YOU RUN, MAN!
RUN!

15:34.334 --> 15:35.868
RUN!

15:37.737 --> 15:40.007
- BRAINS, OH,
YOU'RE FUNNY AND SMART.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.174
- [yelling]

15:43.610 --> 15:45.412
SORRY, BUDDHA BOB!

15:48.415 --> 15:50.150
- BRAINS?
WHERE ARE YOU, BRAINS?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.519
OH, BRAINS!

15:52.519 --> 15:53.753
BRAINS!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.392
- NOW, THE POOL
IN FRONT OF YOU

15:59.392 --> 16:02.795
REPRESENTS RADIOACTIVE
PLASMATIC WASTE.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.265
THE FIRST ONE OF YOU TWO
TO SWIM THROUGH IT

16:05.265 --> 16:09.369
AND SAVE ME FROM THE ZOMBIES
THAT ARE TRYING TO EAT MY FLESH

16:09.369 --> 16:10.470
WINS.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.739
- I'M IMMUNE
TO PLASMATIC WASTE.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.443
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN,
SNACK FOOD.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.677
- AND...

16:17.677 --> 16:18.911
[air horn blares]

16:23.716 --> 16:24.784
- YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

16:29.422 --> 16:30.623
- WOW!

16:30.623 --> 16:31.924
JAMES WINS!

16:31.924 --> 16:33.060
- YES!

16:33.060 --> 16:36.063
- SO THAT'S 73 EVENTS
FOR JAMES,

16:36.063 --> 16:37.730
ZERO EVENTS FOR BITTERS,

16:37.730 --> 16:42.835
WHICH BRINGS THE SCORE
TO 73 TO NOTHING.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.705
BUT...

16:45.705 --> 16:49.309
THE FINAL EVENT
IS WORTH 500 POINTS.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.279
ZOMBIE DANCE-OFF!

16:52.279 --> 16:55.282
- * IT FEELS RIGHT, GIRL,
JUST GIVE ME A SIGN *

16:55.282 --> 16:56.749
* WE'RE GONNA PARTY ALL NIGHT *

16:56.749 --> 16:58.085
- I'M NOT DANCING.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.087
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.257
NOW CHOOSE WHO GETS THE BOTTLE.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.759
- 500 BUCKS.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.161
MY FINAL OFFER.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.362
- FINE.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.500
MR. BITTERS,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.169
YOU'RE AN AMAZING DANCER.

17:16.169 --> 17:19.239
BUT JAMES IS MY BEST FRIEND.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.341
AND I WANT HIM BY MY SIDE.

17:21.341 --> 17:25.145
- WHEN I'M A ZOMBIE,
I'M EATING YOU TWO FIRST.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.447
- WRONG, 'CAUSE WE HAVE...

17:27.447 --> 17:29.149
both:
ZOM-B-GONE!

17:31.651 --> 17:33.186
- OH!

17:33.186 --> 17:35.322
I'M NOT PROTECTED
FROM THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE!

17:41.761 --> 17:43.496
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

17:43.496 --> 17:46.399
- I'D RATHER BE
A ZOMBIE WITH MY BEST BUD

17:46.399 --> 17:47.800
THAN BE HUMAN WITHOUT HIM.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.373
- BESIDES, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS ZOMBIES, RIGHT?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.508
- ZOMBIE, UH, UH...

17:55.508 --> 17:57.043
[girls screaming]

17:57.043 --> 17:58.878
- BRAINS!

17:58.878 --> 18:00.947
both:
IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE!

18:00.947 --> 18:02.182
- GO!

18:02.182 --> 18:03.583
- BRAINS!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.652
BRAINS!

18:05.652 --> 18:06.719
[groaning]

18:08.155 --> 18:10.723
- OKAY, I FINISHED
THE COST REPORTS

18:10.723 --> 18:12.559
AND THE NEW SONG YOU WANTED.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.162
BOSS.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.730
- AND I JUST FINISHED
COLORING MY WHALE.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.167
AND I STAYED INSIDE THE LINES.

18:20.167 --> 18:24.671
- AND I JUST FINISHED WRITING
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.939
- YOU'RE RESIGNING?
WHY?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.276
- BECAUSE I'VE BEEN RUNNING
ROQUE RECORDS

18:29.276 --> 18:30.977
FOR EXACTLY THREE HOURS,

18:30.977 --> 18:35.248
WHICH MEANS GUSTAVO
HAS TO SIGN MY WORK-STUDY SLIP.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.784
- WAIT, THIS WHOLE THING

18:37.784 --> 18:39.819
HAS BEEN ABOUT YOU
COMPLETING YOUR HOURS?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.189
- YEP.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.023
BUT AS MY LAST ACT
AS PRESIDENT,

18:44.023 --> 18:47.194
I WOULD LIKE TO NAME
GUSTAVO ROQUE AS MY SUCCESSOR...

18:47.194 --> 18:49.996
PROVIDED HE NEVER BANS ME
FROM ROQUE RECORDS, EVER.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.063
- DONE.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.733
- BYE, GUYS.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.838
- YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL GONNA
BE WORKING FOR HER ONE DAY.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.072
both: YEP!

19:02.975 --> 19:05.212
- HI, BIG BROTHER.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.313
- HEY, BABY SISTER.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.882
- OH, I JUST RAN ROQUE RECORDS.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.017
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
