We just thought
it was gonna be temporary.

07:45.034 --> 07:46.896
that Ashley walked
through that door...

07:48.137 --> 07:50.068
...she was the missing piece
that completed our family.

07:50.172 --> 07:51.965
Not many people
would adopt a teen.

07:52.068 --> 07:54.793
We finally became the
family we always wanted.

to harm Ashley?

Yeah.

08:14.689 --> 08:17.206
What was she doing
at a motel so close to home?

08:17.310 --> 08:20.310
Maybe she was
meeting up with Travis?

08:20.413 --> 08:21.655
Who's Travis?

08:21.758 --> 08:24.482
Travis Jacobs.
He was a new... friend.

08:24.586 --> 08:26.724
Ashley had roommates, and...

08:26.827 --> 08:29.448

to be alone?

where this Travis lives?

to do with this, do you?

was in that motel with Ashley...

Why haven't we heard from him?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.793
Hey, can I get some extra mayo
with that?

08:50.896 --> 08:53.206
Okay, great. Thanks.
See you in 20.

08:53.310 --> 08:56.448
I'm suddenly in the mood
for a crab roll sandwich.

08:56.551 --> 08:57.965
In the middle of an autopsy.

08:58.068 --> 09:00.448
That is not at all disgusting.No bites for you.

09:00.551 --> 09:03.275
I will settle
for an update on Ensign Watts.Right.

09:03.379 --> 09:04.586
Official cause of death

09:04.689 --> 09:06.586
was forced compression
of the larynx,

09:06.689 --> 09:09.448
which obstructed airflow
and led to asphyxiation.

09:09.551 --> 09:12.620
Mm, that is a lot of words
to say "strangled to death."

09:12.724 --> 09:15.103
Her last meal is actually the
reason why I'm hungry right now.

09:15.206 --> 09:20.206
It was a crab roll using very
high-quality Maryland blue crab.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.448
I am never eating again.

09:22.551 --> 09:25.413
I'm around death all day. I take
inspiration where I can get it.

09:25.517 --> 09:27.068
Anything else?
And please,

09:27.172 --> 09:29.206
not of the
stomach-churning variety.

09:29.310 --> 09:32.241
Right. Her extensive bruising
would tell us

09:32.344 --> 09:34.689
that she fought the good fight
until her last dying breath.

09:34.793 --> 09:37.620
Her elbows, arms and knees

09:37.724 --> 09:40.206
all show injuries

09:40.310 --> 09:42.275
at precise contact points.

09:42.379 --> 09:44.620
Oh, looks like me after
a martial arts sparring session.

09:44.724 --> 09:46.586
JIMMY:Good eye. I think that our
victim probably had training--

09:46.689 --> 09:48.758
extensive training--
from the look of things.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.103
But she was a bean counter.

09:50.206 --> 09:51.724
Nowhere on her file
does it indicate

09:51.827 --> 09:53.103
that she had any kind
of combat training.

09:53.206 --> 09:54.241
Not my department.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.896
Well, it is my department.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.655
So thank you. I'm gonna
go update the team.

09:57.758 --> 10:00.310
And I'm gonna go
enjoy my crab roll.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.448
Was there anything else
you needed?

10:06.551 --> 10:07.965
Mm. No, that's it.

10:08.068 --> 10:10.068
And yet you're still here.

10:10.896 --> 10:13.965

10:14.862 --> 10:17.068
We're good, right?
You and me?

10:17.172 --> 10:19.862
Uh, you and me good how?I mean,

10:19.965 --> 10:23.965
you know, like, you like that--
you-you and me?

10:24.068 --> 10:26.000
Well, you and me
as in "us" you and me?

10:26.103 --> 10:27.931
Yup. That.Well, yeah, of course.

10:28.034 --> 10:29.965
Why are you even asking?Oh, it's...

10:30.068 --> 10:32.344
You know, I'm just checking in.
It's a thing people do.

10:32.448 --> 10:35.620
Well, I'm good if you are.Great. I'm great.

10:35.724 --> 10:37.206
[short chuckle]

10:37.310 --> 10:38.724
Okay, um,

10:38.827 --> 10:41.344
so I'm gonna stop
being awkward now and leave.

10:41.448 --> 10:44.620
Hey.Oh.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.344
Mm-hmm.Yeah.

10:46.448 --> 10:48.931
[laughs softly]

10:50.655 --> 10:51.827
KASIE:
So,

10:51.931 --> 10:54.103
good news for me,
bad news for you.

10:54.206 --> 10:57.448
How is my identity being
stolen good for you?

10:57.551 --> 11:01.068
Because in dissecting your
digital life to find the thief,

11:01.172 --> 11:04.000
I was able to update
my future blackmail file on you.

11:04.103 --> 11:05.620
Next time
I put in for a vacation,

11:05.724 --> 11:07.793
my dates best be approved.

11:07.896 --> 11:09.517
I'll take that
under consideration.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.620
So, the bad news is that
you have a blackmail file on me.

11:12.724 --> 11:16.000
No. Your bad news is a complete
stranger apparently also knows

11:16.103 --> 11:18.517
everything about you--
driver's license number,

11:18.620 --> 11:20.862
mom's maiden name,
your first pet.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.413
How was my personal info hacked?

11:22.517 --> 11:24.137
I mean, I'm hardened
against all the usual vectors.

11:24.241 --> 11:26.689
Rootkit malware?
[scoffs] Please.

11:26.793 --> 11:28.310
Decryption worm?
Forget about it.

11:28.413 --> 11:29.896
That's because
you weren't hacked,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.586
at least
not in the traditional way.

11:31.689 --> 11:33.448
What is the non-traditional way?

11:33.551 --> 11:35.655
Our perp played
the security questions angle.

11:35.758 --> 11:37.206
You know,
those annoying questions

11:37.310 --> 11:38.862
you get asked
when you forget your password?

11:38.965 --> 11:40.620
I never forgot my password,
but just, uh,

11:40.724 --> 11:43.827
go on.Our perp started by making
"lost password" claims

11:43.931 --> 11:45.655
to your least secure
accounts first--

11:45.758 --> 11:47.103
the Pastry of the Month Club,

11:47.206 --> 11:50.034
Virginia Ornithology
Association.

11:50.137 --> 11:52.689
Also some rants you dropped
on an old Sopranosblog?

11:52.793 --> 11:54.172
I was working
FBI Organized Crime.

11:54.275 --> 11:56.724
Those writers were trying
to make us into imbeciles.

11:56.827 --> 11:58.241
Either way,

11:58.344 --> 12:00.689
once the hacker got
their tentacles into your world,

12:00.793 --> 12:02.137
they were able to piece together

12:02.241 --> 12:04.206
your more important
log-ins and passwords.

12:04.310 --> 12:06.275
Just by answering
my security questions?

12:06.379 --> 12:09.172
Whoever did this knows
very personal things about you.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.137
Yeah, personal things
from my past.

12:11.241 --> 12:14.793
Which means maybe our hacker
issomeone from your past,

12:14.896 --> 12:17.965
which brings me
to the bad, bad news.

12:18.068 --> 12:21.689
You never said anything
about there being bad, bad news.

12:21.793 --> 12:24.034
Oh, my bad.

12:24.896 --> 12:26.103
PARKER:
So, in addition

12:26.206 --> 12:28.413
to charging
the motel mini-bar to me,

12:28.517 --> 12:31.068
the person who stole my identity
also used it

12:31.172 --> 12:33.275
to access the DoD mainframe.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.655
Wait, as in the...

12:34.758 --> 12:36.517
Department of Defense, yes.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.206
They get anything good?Yeah. Files of Navy personnel.

12:39.310 --> 12:43.000
They pulled background details
on hundreds of sailors.

12:43.103 --> 12:44.931
Wow. More identities to steal?

12:45.034 --> 12:46.206
PARKER:
I don't think so.
They dug around for a while,

12:46.310 --> 12:48.103
but they were
awfully interested

12:48.206 --> 12:51.172
in one name in particular.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.586
Ensign Watts.Who's dead now.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.172
That's not a coincidence.What about our victim's

12:56.275 --> 12:57.896
new boyfriend,
Travis from Wilmington?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.827
You mean her new boyfriend

12:59.931 --> 13:01.689
that we can't locate
because there's no record

13:01.793 --> 13:04.896
of a Travis Jacobs who matches
his description? Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.586
If that isn't sketchy enough,
turns out

13:06.689 --> 13:08.758
Travis, uh, magically popped up
in Watts' life

13:08.862 --> 13:10.551
the very next day after

13:10.655 --> 13:12.172
her file was accessed.

13:12.275 --> 13:14.275
Well, that doesn't sound
like a coincidence, either.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.655
Whoever this Travis guy is
disappeared.

13:16.758 --> 13:17.896
Sounds like we got a ghost.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.758
Well, then call me
a Ghostbuster,

13:19.862 --> 13:21.344
'cause I got a hit
on our mystery man.

13:21.448 --> 13:23.344
The restaurant where
Ashley and her parents

13:23.448 --> 13:25.413
had brunch with Travis at
has cameras.

13:25.517 --> 13:28.241
Well, the ghost
is doing a good job

13:28.344 --> 13:30.000
playing the loving boyfriend.

13:30.103 --> 13:31.931
All right,
running facial rec now.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.655
Something about
this guy looks...

13:40.758 --> 13:45.034
McGEE:
Okay, got a hit. Travis'
real name is Ryan Aaronson.

13:45.137 --> 13:47.034
And, uh, big shocker--
he's got a record.

13:47.137 --> 13:48.689
You got to be kidding me.

13:48.793 --> 13:51.103
Parker, you know this guy?

13:51.206 --> 13:54.724
No. But I know Ryan's mother.

13:54.827 --> 13:56.620
He is the son

13:56.724 --> 13:58.862
of Joy Aaronson,

13:58.965 --> 14:03.517
but I know her as Joy Sullivan.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.586
And who's Joy Sullivan?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.862
She was...

14:09.965 --> 14:12.517
my first love
when I was just a kid.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.000
Unfortunately, your,
uh, first love's son

14:19.103 --> 14:21.448
is now our prime murder suspect.

14:32.379 --> 14:35.137
Joy Sullivan.
She sounds sweet.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.758
"Sweet" is not how
I would describe Joy.

14:37.862 --> 14:39.758
She was a force
of nature.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.103
Hey, Parker,
seems like you have a type.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.379
She reminds me a lot
of your ex-wife. Vivian?

14:43.482 --> 14:45.068
Yeah, we kind of assumed
that she was the one

14:45.172 --> 14:46.551
you still carried the torch for.

14:46.655 --> 14:48.241
Okay, so how did you
mess things up with this one?

14:48.344 --> 14:51.482
Wait a minute. Why-why are you
assuming it was his fault?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.068
Look at that face, that hair.

14:53.172 --> 14:55.448
Of course
Parker was a heartbreaker.[sighs]

14:55.551 --> 14:57.310
Joy and I grew up
back in Philly.

14:57.413 --> 15:00.379
We're talking peas-in-a-pod,
inseparable

15:00.482 --> 15:02.275
until, uh...

15:02.379 --> 15:04.655
her family moved away
junior year.

15:04.758 --> 15:06.000
You didn't stay in touch?

15:06.103 --> 15:07.517
Well, not for lack of trying.

15:07.620 --> 15:08.896
I mean, I wrote...

15:09.000 --> 15:11.241
wrote her every week for, um...

15:11.344 --> 15:13.586
[scoffs]
a long time,

15:13.689 --> 15:15.379
and she never wrote me back.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.275
Mm, Knight's right.
You did something.

15:17.379 --> 15:19.275
Well, if I did,
I don't know what,

15:19.379 --> 15:21.310
so I took the hint
and stopped writing.

15:21.413 --> 15:22.862
Mm, but you never stopped
thinking about her.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.827
Or cyberstalking her.

15:24.931 --> 15:26.310
Come on. You pulled up

15:26.413 --> 15:28.379
Joy's profile like, uh,
you had it on speed dial.

15:28.482 --> 15:30.862
Sue me for wanting
an ambient awareness

15:30.965 --> 15:32.689
of her life
over the years.

15:32.793 --> 15:35.758
Mm, were you aware
that she was divorced?Yes, I am aware.

15:35.862 --> 15:38.172
And were you also aware that she
lives just outside of Maryland?

15:38.275 --> 15:39.448
And why haven't you reached out?

15:39.551 --> 15:40.620
Because every time

15:40.724 --> 15:42.413
I thought I might... I just...

15:42.517 --> 15:44.551
I chickened out.[laughs softly]

15:44.655 --> 15:47.551
Fate took her away,
so, why tempt fate?

15:47.655 --> 15:50.000
Well, fate brought her back
into your orbit.

15:50.103 --> 15:53.103
No, not fate.This kid

15:53.206 --> 15:55.241
heard about me from Joy.
What do you know about him?

15:55.344 --> 15:57.206
KNIGHT:
Well, it looks like
Ryan spent time in juvie,

15:57.310 --> 15:58.793
followed by arrests

15:58.896 --> 16:01.137
for forgery, wire fraud.

16:01.241 --> 16:02.482
Mainly cheap,
money-making scams.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.862
TORRES:
Yeah, toss in identity theft,

16:03.965 --> 16:05.172
and you have a classic con.

16:05.275 --> 16:06.793
Looks like Ashley
was his next mark.

16:06.896 --> 16:08.310
A mark that ended up dead.

16:08.413 --> 16:10.275
I never imagined
if I saw her again,

16:10.379 --> 16:12.724
I'd be breaking the news
that her son might be

16:12.827 --> 16:14.551
a killer con man.

16:14.655 --> 16:16.655
Knight, Torres,
see if you can find Ryan.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.517
McGee.

16:18.620 --> 16:20.620
With me.

16:20.724 --> 16:22.965
Time to tempt fate.

16:38.034 --> 16:40.241
Something wrong?

16:40.344 --> 16:42.241
No. It just hit me is all.

16:42.344 --> 16:44.413
It's been decades
since I've seen her.

16:44.517 --> 16:46.586
You're nervous.

16:46.689 --> 16:49.413
What? No, of course not.

16:50.586 --> 16:52.448
[sighs]

16:54.034 --> 16:55.931
[exhales]

16:56.034 --> 16:58.517
Do you need me
to ring the bell for you?

16:58.620 --> 17:00.344
No, I got it.

17:00.448 --> 17:04.103
Okay.
Go get 'em, tiger.

17:14.827 --> 17:16.310
Been a long time, Joy.

17:17.792 --> 17:19.172
[grunts]

17:19.275 --> 17:21.378
Ooh.[groans]

17:24.034 --> 17:25.619
You want some, too?

17:25.723 --> 17:27.378
No, no, no, I'm good.

17:28.205 --> 17:29.724
[Parker coughs]

17:29.827 --> 17:31.068
PARKER:
Ugh.

17:31.896 --> 17:34.586
You had that coming to you
for 40 years, Park.

17:34.689 --> 17:36.310
Ruined my life.

17:36.413 --> 17:38.758
How exactly did I do that?I loved my life

17:38.862 --> 17:41.413
in Philly and I was ripped away
from it because of you.

17:41.517 --> 17:42.655
Yeah, you definitely
did something.

17:42.758 --> 17:44.689
More like what didn't he do.

17:44.793 --> 17:47.965
Couldn't say no to trouble
if you paid him to.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.965
Uh, as I recall,
you were attached

17:50.068 --> 17:51.448
to my hip for most
of that trouble.

17:51.551 --> 17:53.482
Exactly. My poor parents--

17:53.586 --> 17:55.000
couldn't have
the neighborhood bad boy

17:55.103 --> 17:56.344
corrupt their daughter.

17:56.448 --> 17:57.620
Cream, two sugars, if I recall?

17:57.724 --> 17:59.931
Are you saying
that your parents moved away

18:00.034 --> 18:01.620
because of me?Yeah, dummy.

18:01.724 --> 18:03.413
What exactly did you think would
happen after what you did

18:03.517 --> 18:05.137
at the St. Paddy's Day
celebration?

18:05.241 --> 18:06.413
I...McGEE: Mm. What did he do

18:06.517 --> 18:08.551
at the St. Paddy's Day
celebration?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.517
Uh, the details don't matter.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.482
I would love
to hear the details.What matters is

18:12.586 --> 18:14.103
that my parents
decided that night

18:14.206 --> 18:15.896
that I couldn't
be around you anymore.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.793
They knew they couldn't keep me
from you unless we left Philly.

18:18.896 --> 18:22.517
Joy, look, I'm-I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.344
Well, if it's any consolation,
the lesson didn't stick,

18:24.448 --> 18:25.965
because you were the first
in a long line

18:26.068 --> 18:27.448
of men that
I should not have dated.

18:27.551 --> 18:29.793
Well, speaking
of, uh, men

18:29.896 --> 18:31.482
that are trouble,
that's why we're here.

18:31.586 --> 18:33.103
My deadbeat ex-husband--
yeah, he's in prison.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.448
I'll give you directions.

18:34.551 --> 18:36.172
We're not here about him.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.103
Oh, God. Ryan?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.103
What did he do now?

18:42.206 --> 18:44.344
He stole my identity.

18:44.448 --> 18:46.413
Apparently,
you were talking about me,

18:46.517 --> 18:49.000
and you told him enough
that he hacked into my, uh...

18:49.103 --> 18:50.620
No offense, but

18:50.724 --> 18:53.758
I haven't spoken about you
to anyone for the last 20 years.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.068
Offense taken.

18:56.172 --> 18:57.689
But somehow, your son

18:57.793 --> 19:00.793
knows details that only
a small group of people knew.

19:04.862 --> 19:07.068
Ryan doesn't come
around here much anymore,

19:07.172 --> 19:08.896
but he did visit
a few weeks ago.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.482
Needed to do laundry?

19:10.586 --> 19:13.482
Uh, funnily enough, no.
He didn't ask for money, either.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.517
Although I should have
realized something was up.

19:19.724 --> 19:21.275
Take it you're
missing something?

19:21.379 --> 19:24.655
Ryan took my letters.
The ones you wrote to me.

19:24.758 --> 19:26.172
You kept them?

19:26.275 --> 19:27.724
Yeah.

19:27.827 --> 19:30.068
Why didn't you ever
write me back?

19:30.172 --> 19:32.068
Because I was angry,

19:32.172 --> 19:35.275
and I was hurt that
you didn't come back after me.

19:35.379 --> 19:36.517
I didn't know you wanted me to.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.482
You're such an idiot.

19:38.586 --> 19:41.931
I know not writing back
was petty, but I was young.

19:42.034 --> 19:44.965
And, you know,
then the rest of life happened.

19:45.068 --> 19:48.551
Oh, your, uh... your son
must have used the information

19:48.655 --> 19:51.482
in those letters to hijack
Agent Parker's identity.

19:51.586 --> 19:55.137
Then used my DoD access
to target a Naval officer.

19:55.241 --> 19:56.827
And that officer is now dead.

19:56.931 --> 19:58.689
No way.

19:58.793 --> 20:02.034
Ryan does not have
a violent bone in his body.

20:02.137 --> 20:03.620
Joy, he took the letters.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.724
He's clearly the one
that stole my identity.

20:05.827 --> 20:07.896
I'm telling you,
Ryan is not smart enough

20:08.000 --> 20:09.862
to pull that off alone. I...

20:09.965 --> 20:12.551
What-Whatever's going on,
Todd is behind it.

20:12.655 --> 20:13.689
That bastard.

20:13.793 --> 20:15.137
Who's Todd?

20:15.241 --> 20:17.137
He's my ex's partner.
He's a con man.

20:17.241 --> 20:18.965
When my ex got pinched,

20:19.068 --> 20:22.068
Todd set his sights on Ryan
as his replacement partner.

20:22.172 --> 20:23.965
I told Ryan
that Todd was bad news,

20:24.068 --> 20:26.517
but, hey, that kid--
he takes after his father.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.172
Do you know where
we could find Todd?

20:28.275 --> 20:30.758
He's got a pool hall in Hampden,
but he'll-he'll make you out

20:30.862 --> 20:32.758
as feds as soon
as you walk through the door.

20:33.965 --> 20:36.620
But he might talk to you
if I'm with you.

20:36.724 --> 20:39.034
Uh, that's not
gonna happen, Joy.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.551
You want another punch
to the gut?

20:41.482 --> 20:43.793
Just try and keep me from

20:43.896 --> 20:46.000
helping my kid.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.000
[door opens]

20:47.103 --> 20:48.655
Yeah, you were right.

20:48.758 --> 20:51.551
Not exactly what I would
describe as "sweet."

20:54.034 --> 20:56.241
♪ ♪

20:57.931 --> 21:00.827
Double or nothing,
I can sink that four-ball next.

21:00.931 --> 21:02.310
What do you say, Father?

21:04.551 --> 21:05.551
I wouldn't take that bet.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.310
Not because the Bible says

21:07.413 --> 21:08.724
the love of money
is the root of all evil,

21:08.827 --> 21:10.310
but because
he's setting you up.

21:10.413 --> 21:12.448
Really, Joy?
You come in here dragging

21:12.551 --> 21:14.448
a pair of cops behind you?Uh, Mr. Mercer,

21:14.551 --> 21:19.103
I'm Agent Parker, NCIS.
This is Agent McGee.

21:19.206 --> 21:20.517
We've got some questions

21:20.620 --> 21:21.620
that we want to ask you.What did you get Ryan

21:21.724 --> 21:23.034
mixed up in?Uh, we're the ones

21:23.137 --> 21:25.517
conducting the interview here.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.034
But we are here about Ryan.What about him?

21:28.137 --> 21:30.448
You dragged him into some con,
and you got a woman killed.

21:30.551 --> 21:32.517
Okay.You might want
to muzzle that one.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.206
I ain't seen Ryan in days,

21:34.310 --> 21:36.172
and I don't know nothing
about no dead woman.

21:36.275 --> 21:38.620
How dare you take
advantage of my son!Hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:38.724 --> 21:41.724
This isn't good cop,
bad Joy, okay?

21:42.827 --> 21:44.241
If you're done
with the theatrics,

21:44.344 --> 21:45.689
I've got some work to do.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.379
[sighs]
No, almost done.

21:47.482 --> 21:49.206
One more question,
but it's not for you.Ah.

21:49.310 --> 21:50.551
How much jail time

21:50.655 --> 21:52.068
is this guy looking at?

21:52.172 --> 21:53.413
Mandatory minimum, 30 years

21:53.517 --> 21:54.931
without the possibility
of parole.

21:55.034 --> 21:56.275
[short chuckle]
Nice try.

21:56.379 --> 21:58.241
Identity theft
caps out at one year.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.344
Who said anything
about identity theft?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.517
Did he just incriminate himself,
Agent McGee?

22:03.620 --> 22:05.310
I believe he did, Agent Parker.

22:05.413 --> 22:07.758
I was talking about
first-degree felony murder,

22:07.862 --> 22:09.931
which you're about
to be charged with

22:10.034 --> 22:11.551
in about ten seconds.

22:11.655 --> 22:13.793
Yeah, unless you can do better
than "I don't know."

22:15.172 --> 22:18.413
Or we can just step away
and let Joy kick your ass.

22:20.931 --> 22:23.758
But how did he get her
to hand over her passwords

22:23.862 --> 22:26.172
for NAVSEA?How's it going?

22:26.275 --> 22:27.689
Well, apparently,
Todd was pulling

22:27.793 --> 22:30.344
the old CIA recruiter con.My favorite.

22:30.448 --> 22:32.689
I've done it twice.
How'd this one work?

22:32.793 --> 22:34.206
Ryan convinced
Ensign Watts

22:34.310 --> 22:35.896
that he was recruiting
her for the CIA.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.172
And once he had her
believing that, he tricked her

22:38.275 --> 22:41.344
into giving him access to the
accounting system at NAVSEA.

22:41.448 --> 22:42.896
And then
it was just a simple matter

22:43.000 --> 22:44.965
of adding my pool hall
to their payroll ledger.

22:45.068 --> 22:47.275
And you just sat back and cashed
the checks as they came in?

22:47.379 --> 22:49.448
I was just trying to get my
piece of that government pork.

22:49.551 --> 22:51.448
But I don't know nothing
about that.

22:51.551 --> 22:53.413
Whatever happened there
is between Ryan and her.

22:53.517 --> 22:55.034
You have any idea
where Ryan might be?

22:55.137 --> 22:56.482
I haven't heard a word from him

22:56.586 --> 22:58.000
since he tried to shut me down.PARKER: Wait.

22:58.103 --> 23:00.241
Wait. What's that supposed mean?

23:00.344 --> 23:04.034
Ryan wanted to call things off.Why?

23:04.137 --> 23:06.758
Because he didn't want to get
Ashley in trouble with the Navy.

23:06.862 --> 23:09.517
Ryan broke the first
rule of the game--

23:09.620 --> 23:11.034
never fall for your mark.

23:11.137 --> 23:14.275
And he was, what--
in love with Ashley?

23:14.379 --> 23:15.931
Those were his exact words.

23:16.034 --> 23:17.379
You know, maybe

23:17.482 --> 23:19.689
she found out he played her
and things got ugly,

23:19.793 --> 23:21.896
which wouldn't
surprise me at all.And why is that?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.586
There was something
about that girl.

23:23.689 --> 23:25.275
Something like what?

23:25.379 --> 23:27.965
Ryan brought her around once
to play pool, and I can tell

23:28.068 --> 23:30.586
from the moment I met her
she had an angle.

23:30.689 --> 23:32.862
A con can tell
when someone's keeping secrets,

23:32.965 --> 23:35.793
and she was keeping something
from Ryan.

23:36.655 --> 23:38.034
TORRES:
Are we sure

23:38.137 --> 23:39.586
this guy isn't just trying
to save his own ass

23:39.689 --> 23:41.206
by pinning Ashley's
murder on Ryan?

23:41.310 --> 23:42.862
He's got an alibi.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.310
He was with his podiatrist
getting a corn removed

23:45.413 --> 23:47.034
when Ashley was killed.

23:47.137 --> 23:50.000
What do you think he meant
by, uh, Ashley having secrets?

23:50.103 --> 23:52.068
I don't know, but
I don't trust a con man.

23:52.172 --> 23:54.482
You cannot play the game
if you're not skilled

23:54.586 --> 23:56.103
in reading human behavior.

23:56.206 --> 23:58.344
Well, maybe we should
focus less on Ryan

23:58.448 --> 24:00.379
and have a closer
look at Ashley.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.310
Just spoke to her neighbor.

24:02.413 --> 24:04.517
They saw her roughly eight hours
before she was killed.

24:04.620 --> 24:06.103
Said she looked frazzled,
left in a hurry.

24:06.206 --> 24:07.551
TORRES:
Eight hours?

24:07.655 --> 24:08.965
That's a lot of missing time.PARKER: All right.

24:09.068 --> 24:10.689
Let's track her phone,
see where she went.

24:10.793 --> 24:13.103
Ah, don't bother.
She left it in her apartment.

24:13.206 --> 24:16.068
I'd leave my eyeballs behind
before I left my phone.

24:16.172 --> 24:19.000
Maybe she ditched it on purpose,
to drop off the grid.

24:19.103 --> 24:22.103
Are you saying that Ashley isn't
just an innocent victim here?

24:22.206 --> 24:23.896
I'm thinking we need
to know what happened

24:24.000 --> 24:25.620
between her leaving home,
eating a delicious crab roll,

24:25.724 --> 24:27.206
and then ending up dead.

24:27.310 --> 24:29.103
Did Ryan mention anything
to his mother about Ashley?

24:29.206 --> 24:31.827
Joy said she never met her,
though I could go see

24:31.931 --> 24:34.068
if there's anything
she overlooked.

24:34.172 --> 24:38.068
"Go see" as in, like...
house call?

24:39.896 --> 24:42.206
An official NCIS interview.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.862
Like, back at her house?
Tonight?

24:44.965 --> 24:48.034
Well, I'm sure that she would
appreciate, uh, an update,

24:48.137 --> 24:50.172
given the sensitive nature
of the investigation.

24:50.275 --> 24:52.379
Right, and it's...
You know, what's better

24:52.482 --> 24:54.620
than a face-to-face?

24:54.724 --> 24:56.931
It's the proper thing to do.

25:00.172 --> 25:01.793
Mm.

25:01.896 --> 25:03.931
JOY:
Park, uh, what are...

25:04.034 --> 25:07.344
what are you doing?I know I should have
called first, but...

25:07.448 --> 25:09.655
I just thought
I'd... check up,

25:09.758 --> 25:11.068
see how you're doing.I'm fine.

25:11.172 --> 25:12.310
RYAN:
Hey, Mom,

25:12.413 --> 25:13.379
when'd you switch

25:13.482 --> 25:14.758
to stupid deca...

25:17.482 --> 25:19.655
What is he
doing here?

25:29.724 --> 25:30.862
Did you turn me in?I swear,

25:30.965 --> 25:32.137
I didn't even know
he was coming.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.206
Are you aiding
and abetting my suspect?

25:34.310 --> 25:36.413
You mean my son. Relax.
I was still gonna call you.

25:36.517 --> 25:38.620
What? Mom, I came
to you for help.

25:38.724 --> 25:40.689
He's the only one
who can help you now.

25:40.793 --> 25:42.310
She's right. If you had nothing

25:42.413 --> 25:45.000
to do with Ashley's murder,
you need to talk to me.

25:47.068 --> 25:49.068
Don't you dare break
your mother's heart.

25:50.551 --> 25:52.793
Okay, Ryan, you know the drill.

25:52.896 --> 25:55.103
You're gonna talk
to Agent Parker

25:55.206 --> 25:56.689
and you're gonna do
what you're not good at.

25:56.793 --> 25:58.551
You're gonna tell the truth.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.896
Don't let this fall on his head,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.103
Park.

26:03.206 --> 26:05.758
He's saveable,
just like you were.

26:11.793 --> 26:14.689
I swear on my mother's life,

26:14.793 --> 26:18.275
I didn't kill Ashley.

26:18.379 --> 26:20.517
I loved her.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.655
You know, she was... the one.

26:23.758 --> 26:25.724
That's why
I tried to stop Todd.

26:25.827 --> 26:27.862
[sighs]
But he went behind your back

26:27.965 --> 26:29.896
and pulled off the con anyway.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.862
And as soon I found out,
I went straight to Ashley

26:31.965 --> 26:33.482
and I told her everything.

26:33.586 --> 26:36.137
You know, who I really was.

26:36.241 --> 26:37.931
What I'd done.

26:38.034 --> 26:40.000
Oh, I'm sure
that went over well.

26:40.103 --> 26:41.482
You're wrong.

26:41.586 --> 26:43.068
She forgave me.

26:44.068 --> 26:47.103
You duped her half a dozen ways,

26:47.206 --> 26:49.310
and she said, what--
"It's all good"?

26:49.413 --> 26:50.896
It's the truth.
She told me

26:51.000 --> 26:52.896
that she loved me, too,
and she was gonna find a way

26:53.000 --> 26:54.862
to make things right
so we could be together.

26:54.965 --> 26:57.000
Make things right?
With who, the Navy?

26:57.103 --> 26:58.862
That's what I thought
at first.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.862
She was gonna find some way
to undo what Todd did, but then,

27:01.965 --> 27:04.275
uh, something felt...

27:04.379 --> 27:05.620
off.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.620
Off how?I'm not quite sure.

27:07.724 --> 27:11.034
Because, suddenly, she went all
cloak-and-dagger and told me

27:11.137 --> 27:14.000
to arrange the motel room
and to use an alias.

27:14.103 --> 27:15.379
Aka mine.

27:15.482 --> 27:16.862
When I got to the motel,

27:16.965 --> 27:19.172
she was already...

27:20.724 --> 27:23.448
I took off
when I saw her lying there.

27:23.551 --> 27:25.931
That's all I know.

27:27.068 --> 27:29.344
Look, you guys
have to believe me.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.206
I loved her,

27:31.310 --> 27:32.551
and she loved me, too.

27:32.655 --> 27:35.068
I would never hurt Ashley.

27:35.172 --> 27:37.241
Well, we would love
to believe you.

27:38.068 --> 27:39.793
But the one thing
missing here is proof

27:39.896 --> 27:41.344
that any of this is true.

27:41.448 --> 27:43.000
[sighs]

27:44.275 --> 27:45.862
Wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.827
I, uh... I-I still have
the voice mail that she left me.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.448
What voice mail?

27:51.551 --> 27:52.896
ASHLEY:
Text me the room code

27:53.000 --> 27:55.172
and wait exactly ten minutes
for my call.

27:55.275 --> 27:57.448
It's imperative
you don't call me back.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.724
It's too dangerous.

28:00.965 --> 28:03.655
I know you have questions,
but I'll answer them later.

28:05.482 --> 28:07.172
I love you.

28:07.275 --> 28:09.758
That sounds pretty
cloak-and-daggery to me.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.103
She also sounds very scared.

28:11.206 --> 28:12.827
Yeah, but who
was she scared of?

28:12.931 --> 28:15.103
And why would our Navy officer
use a burner phone

28:15.206 --> 28:16.827
to leave messages?Well, it looks

28:16.931 --> 28:19.344
like Todd was right-- Ashley had
some secrets of her own.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.379
If we're gonna find her killer,
we need to know

28:21.482 --> 28:23.655
what Ashley was doing
in those eight hours.

28:23.758 --> 28:25.896
Knight, call Kasie and see if
she can pull anything else

28:26.000 --> 28:28.206
from this voice mail, okay?

28:29.034 --> 28:32.034
Parker, can I ask you
something real quick?Yeah.

28:32.137 --> 28:34.137
Are you sure that
we don't already

28:34.241 --> 28:35.862
have the killer in
our holding cell,

28:35.965 --> 28:37.448
and that Ryan's mom
isn't just playing us?

28:37.551 --> 28:41.000
You think Joy is trying
to throw us off Ryan's scent?

28:41.103 --> 28:43.103
Well, it's been done before.

28:43.206 --> 28:44.931
She's just protecting her kid.

28:45.034 --> 28:46.310
I'm told that's what parents do.

28:46.413 --> 28:47.517
Well, within reason, yeah.

28:47.620 --> 28:48.965
Well, she's protecting him

28:49.068 --> 28:50.758
because she's trusting me
to do the job.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.620
We see this thing through,

28:52.724 --> 28:55.137
even if it lands
at Ryan's feet, right?

28:55.241 --> 28:56.517
Right.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.103
Look,

28:58.206 --> 28:59.931
I'm-I'm not saying
that Joy is some kind of saint,

29:00.034 --> 29:02.344
but, back in the day,

29:02.448 --> 29:05.172
she refused to turn her back
on me when everybody else did.

29:05.275 --> 29:07.758
Her faith was
the kick in the ass I needed

29:07.862 --> 29:09.379
to start turning my life around.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.586
Even when her parents
moved her away,

29:11.689 --> 29:13.551
I wasn't about to let her down.

29:13.655 --> 29:16.379
Not then, not now.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.896
ASHLEY:
Text me the room code

29:23.000 --> 29:24.931
and wait exactly ten minutes
for my call.

29:25.034 --> 29:26.931
It's imperative
you don't call me back...

29:27.034 --> 29:28.758
Any updates on the voice mail
that Ashley left?

29:28.862 --> 29:31.689
Uh, I am running it through
an audio scrubber right now.

29:31.793 --> 29:34.448
It ought to enhance
any background noise that might

29:34.551 --> 29:36.517
help us ID her location
when she left it.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.310
This might take a minute. I can
call you when I have something.

29:43.862 --> 29:45.413
Okay, girl, spill.

29:46.275 --> 29:49.517
Has Jimmy mentioned
anything lately,

29:49.620 --> 29:53.034
you know, about him and... me?

29:53.137 --> 29:54.758
Um, why are you asking?

29:54.862 --> 29:56.586
Something's up with Jimmy.

29:56.689 --> 29:58.931
And I hate feeling
like I'm back in high school

29:59.034 --> 30:01.310
worrying that my crush
isn't crushing back.

30:01.413 --> 30:06.241
Oh! But I love picturing high
school Jess with butterflies.

30:06.344 --> 30:07.931
[laughs]
Okay.

30:08.034 --> 30:10.103
I wasn't even that high school
girl when I was in high school.

30:10.206 --> 30:12.379
I didn't crush
and I didn't do butterflies

30:12.482 --> 30:15.206
and I didn't, you know,
put notes in peoples' lockers.

30:15.310 --> 30:17.793
So why are you suddenly twisting
yourself into knots over Jimmy?

30:17.896 --> 30:19.620
Okay, let's not go that far.

30:19.724 --> 30:22.344
I'm just saying, Jimmy had
a really weird reaction

30:22.448 --> 30:25.103
when I suggested that we invite
Victoria to movie night.

30:25.206 --> 30:26.517
Ooh, movie night? Yes, please.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.310
What are we seeing?[chuckles]

30:28.413 --> 30:32.344
Okay, Jimmy and I are gonna
go see the next Codename: Fury.

30:34.448 --> 30:35.448
Yeah.

30:35.551 --> 30:37.724
That movie goes way back.

30:40.758 --> 30:42.000
And I think I know

30:42.103 --> 30:43.655
what's up with Jimmy.[computer dings]

30:43.758 --> 30:45.655
Ooh.

30:45.758 --> 30:47.448
It's the ambient
dialogue filter.

30:47.551 --> 30:49.689
Looks like it pulled some
background audio from the call.

30:49.793 --> 30:52.034
ASHLEY: ...call me back.
It's too dangerous.[chime sounds]

30:52.137 --> 30:54.241
MAN [over P.A.]:
Next stop Shady Grove,
end of the line.

30:54.344 --> 30:55.482
ASHLEY:
I know you have questions,

30:55.586 --> 30:56.793
but I'll answer them later.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.482
That's a Metro train.
It sounds like

30:58.586 --> 31:00.965
Ashley was on the Red Line
when she called Ryan.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.172
Heading out of the city
and into the boonies.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.931
But what was she doing
way out there?

31:07.206 --> 31:09.172
Ashley first boarded
the Red Line in D.C.,

31:09.275 --> 31:12.172
then exited the Shady Grove
station and headed east on foot.

31:12.275 --> 31:14.379
The last camera that
spotted her was just outside

31:14.482 --> 31:17.172
of a restaurant called
Blue's Crab Shack.

31:17.275 --> 31:20.137
Which boasts the best Maryland
blue crab roll in the city.

31:20.241 --> 31:22.758
Which was also Ashley's
last meal, according to Jimmy.

31:22.862 --> 31:24.310
I love me a good crab roll,

31:24.413 --> 31:26.448
but, uh, after running scared
from her apartment,

31:26.551 --> 31:30.034
then leaving that voice mail
to Ryan, it's hard to swallow

31:30.137 --> 31:32.137
she went all the way out there
just for a crustacean.

31:32.241 --> 31:33.551
She didn't.KNIGHT: The restaurant's

31:33.655 --> 31:35.965
across the street from
a self-storage lot.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.655
McGEE:
We did some checking,
and it turns out

31:37.758 --> 31:39.379
Ashley has a unit there.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.379
A unit that she visited mere
hours before she was murdered,

31:41.482 --> 31:43.310
according to the logs
that we were sent.

31:43.413 --> 31:45.103
Must be something
pretty important in that unit.

31:45.206 --> 31:47.413
Torres, Knight, find out what.

31:54.103 --> 31:57.655
So, what do we have in here?

31:57.758 --> 31:59.068
This is all a bunch of crap.

31:59.172 --> 32:02.206
Who knows what
she actually came here for.

32:03.034 --> 32:05.344
Does this place feel
a little small to you?

32:05.448 --> 32:09.103
The rental agreement
says it's 300 square feet.

32:12.275 --> 32:13.793
Hey.

32:13.896 --> 32:16.965
This stain looks like
it's coming from the other side.

32:20.448 --> 32:23.206
It's hollow.

32:23.310 --> 32:24.931
Hey, Knight?

32:37.241 --> 32:39.482
What in the Assassin's Creed?

32:41.724 --> 32:43.379
KNIGHT:
Whoa.

32:49.172 --> 32:50.896
We have foreign currency here.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.379
And I've got some passports.

32:53.482 --> 32:56.275
I think we just
figured out why Ashley

32:56.379 --> 32:58.724
forgave our con man
for lying about who he was.

32:58.827 --> 33:01.620
She was lying
to him, too.

33:08.344 --> 33:10.275
Given everything
that we've collected

33:10.379 --> 33:13.241
from Ashley's secret room,
she's got to be a spy, right?

33:13.344 --> 33:15.413
Or some sort
of con artist herself.

33:15.517 --> 33:18.137
That might explain the multiple
passports in multiple names.

33:18.241 --> 33:19.965
But not the arsenal
of high-powered weapons.

33:20.068 --> 33:22.172
Okay, spy it is,
but who is she working for?

33:22.275 --> 33:24.103
And what was her mission?Well, we know she lobbied hard

33:24.206 --> 33:25.620
to get herself assigned
to NAVSEA.

33:25.724 --> 33:28.310
It's a smart place for a hostile
power to have an asset.

33:28.413 --> 33:30.310
And lots of intel
on what keeps our navy afloat.

33:30.413 --> 33:32.931
Yeah, and imagine her surprise
when she was approached

33:33.034 --> 33:34.965
by Ryan to join the CIA.

33:35.068 --> 33:36.172
Oh, she would have jumped
at that chance.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.344
PARKER:
Embed a spy within the company.

33:38.448 --> 33:41.206
That's the Holy Grail for a
foreign intelligence agency.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.551
Except it was all a lie.

33:42.655 --> 33:44.344
Talk about ironic.
A deceitful con man

33:44.448 --> 33:47.241
targets a bona fide spy
trained in the art of deceit?

33:47.344 --> 33:49.448
Yeah, but according to Ryan,
love conquered all for them.

33:49.551 --> 33:52.034
A real life
The Spy Who Loved Me.If Ryan didn't kill Ashley,

33:52.137 --> 33:54.034
I may have an idea who did.
Spies have handlers,

33:54.137 --> 33:57.448
and handlers don't like it when
their spies get compromised.

33:57.551 --> 33:59.379
Kind of a cardinal sin
for a secret agent.

33:59.482 --> 34:01.655
Ashley was afraid
on that voice mail.

34:01.758 --> 34:03.689
She knew that she and Ryan
were in danger.

34:03.793 --> 34:06.206
So, whoever killed Ashley
might still be after Ryan.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.000
That could be
an advantage for us.

34:08.103 --> 34:10.034
Use him to flush them out.

34:10.137 --> 34:11.379
Think he's up for it?

34:11.482 --> 34:13.585
RYAN:
Look, I'll do it.

34:13.688 --> 34:15.757
No, you won't!

34:15.862 --> 34:18.275
Not a chance in hell
are you using my kid as bait

34:18.379 --> 34:20.757
to catch some spy-killing spy.Joy, if he helps us,

34:20.862 --> 34:24.103
I can talk to the D.A.,
maybe he avoids prison.

34:24.206 --> 34:26.275
Yeah, aside from that...
for once, Mom,

34:26.379 --> 34:28.447
I'd kind of like
to do the right thing.

34:28.551 --> 34:31.344
Though avoiding prison
does sound pretty good.

34:31.447 --> 34:33.034
No way.PARKER: Joy, listen to me.

34:33.137 --> 34:36.034
Listen to me.
He's saveable, okay?

34:36.137 --> 34:38.172
This is how we save him.

34:43.688 --> 34:46.172
Well, that's my third cup
of coffee.

34:46.275 --> 34:47.757
Gonna have to pee soon.

34:47.862 --> 34:49.344
Nobody forced you

34:49.447 --> 34:50.931
to drink that many lattes.

34:51.034 --> 34:52.688
RYAN:
I don't understand how

34:52.793 --> 34:55.413
this handler dude is supposed
to just find me here.

34:55.516 --> 34:57.413
KNIGHT:We asked the Office
of Naval Intelligence

34:57.517 --> 34:59.310
to flood the zone with chatter
that you're back in town.

34:59.413 --> 35:02.758
If you have a target on your
back, the handler will find you.

35:03.758 --> 35:05.517
[scoffs]

35:06.724 --> 35:08.965
Looks like Ashley's parents
found me first.

35:09.068 --> 35:10.655
Which isn't very likely.

35:10.758 --> 35:13.724
Hello, Travis.Or is it Ryan now?

35:14.448 --> 35:17.551
Unless those aren't actually
Ashley's parents. Let's move in.

35:20.793 --> 35:22.068
RENEÉE:
Da.

35:22.172 --> 35:24.448
PARKER:
Freeze! NCIS! Hands up!

35:24.551 --> 35:25.551
Up! Up!

35:27.793 --> 35:30.655
KNIGHT:
Thumbs out.

35:30.758 --> 35:33.793
Not exactly
the family next door.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.344
[handcuffs clicking]

35:40.896 --> 35:42.724
Can't believe that
Ashley's adoptive parents

35:42.827 --> 35:44.241
were Russian sleeper spies.

35:44.344 --> 35:46.241
Oh, and that was
just their cover.

35:46.344 --> 35:48.137
Looks like the three of them
popped up ten years ago

35:48.241 --> 35:49.586
posing as typical Americans.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.310
Ah. They confess
to her murder?

35:51.413 --> 35:53.551
Well, with their op blown,
they're cooperating.

35:53.655 --> 35:56.413
Safest place for them now
is an American supermax.

35:56.517 --> 35:59.172
Sounds like a plotline
to a Codename: Furymovie.

35:59.275 --> 36:01.137
[both laugh]

36:03.793 --> 36:05.724
Actually, uh,

36:05.827 --> 36:08.551
I think that's something
that we should talk about.

36:09.931 --> 36:12.655
It's not an easy thing
for me to bring up.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.034
Oh, no. We're still on
for our date night, aren't we?

36:15.137 --> 36:17.275
[chuckles]

36:17.379 --> 36:19.275
Well, I remember you mentioned

36:19.379 --> 36:22.275
that those movies
were a family favorite

36:22.379 --> 36:26.103
with you and Victoria
and Breena.

36:29.724 --> 36:32.655
And I realized yesterday that
this is gonna be the first time

36:32.758 --> 36:35.000
that you're seeing one
of those movies

36:35.103 --> 36:36.827
without your wife.

36:36.931 --> 36:40.310
Yeah. It's another bridge
to cross, you know?

36:40.413 --> 36:42.896
I have crossed plenty by now.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.724
Right.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.000
Like your first Thanksgiving
without Breena.

36:48.103 --> 36:51.413
And your first
Christmas.

36:52.689 --> 36:54.896
Each one of those
had to have hurt.

36:57.344 --> 37:00.448
But there is one more bridge
for you to cross.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.655
And I think that one's
gonna hurt the most.

37:09.068 --> 37:11.965
It's, um...

37:12.068 --> 37:13.862
It's me

37:13.965 --> 37:16.689
being a part
of your daughter's life.

37:18.137 --> 37:20.241
That's the last bridge.

37:20.344 --> 37:22.275
A final symbol

37:22.379 --> 37:24.586
that Breena is really gone.

37:26.241 --> 37:28.137
And I think you feel like

37:28.241 --> 37:30.137
you're saying goodbye
to her for good,

37:30.241 --> 37:31.862
and I know that has to hurt.

37:33.379 --> 37:34.793
And I don't want to push you.

37:34.896 --> 37:36.620
I feel really bad
for having pushed you.

37:36.724 --> 37:39.310
Jessica, stop, stop.
Just... stop.

37:39.413 --> 37:41.965
Y-You have nothing
to apologize for, okay?

37:43.482 --> 37:45.379
You're right.

37:45.482 --> 37:48.724
This is something
that I have to do, and, um...

37:52.172 --> 37:54.965
It's just really hard.

37:57.931 --> 37:59.965
I, uh...

38:00.068 --> 38:02.586
I really want to, um...

38:06.758 --> 38:08.000
Come here.

38:08.103 --> 38:09.827
Oh.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.034
I know this must
be hard for you.

38:20.137 --> 38:21.275
I've been there.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.275
The love of my life
was a foreign agent

38:23.379 --> 38:25.275
murdered by her own country.

38:25.379 --> 38:27.275
I don't think you've been there.

38:27.379 --> 38:29.206
No, not exactly.

38:29.310 --> 38:31.482
But back in the day,

38:31.586 --> 38:35.206
I was on the wrong path,
just like you.

38:35.310 --> 38:36.724
Friends with
all the wrong people.

38:40.379 --> 38:42.586
Price I paid
was losing your mother.

38:46.068 --> 38:47.793
Look, Ryan, I'm just saying,

38:47.896 --> 38:49.965
that, uh, if you keep walking
the path you're on,

38:50.068 --> 38:51.413
today is just the appetizer.

38:51.517 --> 38:52.689
You ain't close
to the bottom yet,

38:52.793 --> 38:54.620
but you'll eventually get there.

38:54.724 --> 38:56.724
Or...

38:56.827 --> 39:00.827
you can take all that skill
as a con, crook,

39:00.931 --> 39:02.862
hustler, swindler,

39:02.965 --> 39:04.724
cheat...

39:04.827 --> 39:06.965
and you can actually
turn it into something good.

39:07.068 --> 39:09.068
How?

39:11.793 --> 39:14.310
Come to work
for the good guys.

39:14.413 --> 39:16.758
I pulled some strings
with friends at the FBI

39:16.862 --> 39:18.827
so you could serve
your probation with them.

39:18.931 --> 39:20.000
You mean, uh,

39:20.103 --> 39:23.379
like Leo in Catch Me if You Can?Hey,

39:23.482 --> 39:26.517
they've reformed lots
of criminals before.

39:28.172 --> 39:31.655
It's not like
I really got a choice, do I?

39:33.310 --> 39:35.620
You always got a choice.

39:36.827 --> 39:38.862
All right.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.758
Yeah, I got to
ask one thing.

39:43.862 --> 39:45.379
The way you wormed
into my accounts.

39:45.482 --> 39:47.655
That info wasn't all
in those letters.

39:47.758 --> 39:50.896
How much did your mom
talk about me?

39:52.482 --> 39:53.931
You really want to know

39:54.034 --> 39:55.931
all the embarrassing things
she told me about you?

39:56.034 --> 39:58.931
You're right.
Best to forget.

39:59.034 --> 40:01.172
I'll tell you this.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.448
When she did talk about it,

40:02.551 --> 40:04.620
it always put a smile
on her face.

40:04.724 --> 40:08.068
She's been lonely
a long time, you know?

40:16.724 --> 40:18.620
[laughs]

40:18.724 --> 40:20.896
Is that Philly butter cake?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.517
Straight from
VonRoenn Bakery, all right?

40:23.620 --> 40:25.724
You drove all the way to the
old neighborhood to get this?

40:25.827 --> 40:28.379
Yeah, it's one
of our favorites.

40:28.482 --> 40:30.413
Thank you, Park.

40:30.517 --> 40:32.586
Been jonesing for
this cake for years.

40:32.689 --> 40:34.206
No.

40:34.310 --> 40:37.344
Thank you
for setting Ryan straight.

40:38.896 --> 40:40.551
Well, I just needed
a reformed bad boy

40:40.655 --> 40:42.931
to show him how it's done.

40:44.620 --> 40:46.793
You never thought
of having kids?

40:46.896 --> 40:49.758
Children wasn't really
in the cards for me and my ex.

40:49.862 --> 40:52.206
Sh... She just...

40:52.310 --> 40:53.862
Ah.

40:53.965 --> 40:56.068
Hard to explain.

40:56.172 --> 40:58.103
I'll bet.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.793
Vivian's a unique woman.

41:04.137 --> 41:06.241
How do you know her name?I know more than her name.

41:06.344 --> 41:09.965
She paid me a visit once.
Right after your divorce.

41:10.827 --> 41:13.724
Wha... What did she want?

41:13.827 --> 41:15.931
She told me
she wanted to meet the woman

41:16.034 --> 41:19.103
she was competing against
her entire marriage.

41:19.206 --> 41:22.551
[sighs]
Oh. I... Hey.

41:22.655 --> 41:25.965
Joy, I'm sorry. Viv is just...

41:26.068 --> 41:27.965
She... [laughs]

41:28.068 --> 41:29.793
She's a unique woman.

41:29.896 --> 41:32.655
She said that even though you
guys had your share of problems,

41:32.758 --> 41:34.379
she always felt that

41:34.482 --> 41:36.517
you were holding a candle
for someone else.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.517
I guess she figured it was me.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.068
She believed
you never got over me.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.586
I did not.

41:49.275 --> 41:51.827
Still have not.

42:00.068 --> 42:02.517
Did you get over me?
