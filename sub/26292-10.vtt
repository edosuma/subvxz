WEBVTT

00:03.786 --> 00:05.483
- Previously,
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:05.527 --> 00:07.790
- You have cancer.
Squamous cell carcinoma.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.271
- I want to try
precision targeted therapy.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.316
Chemo's gonna take the life
out of me and I--I want

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
to keep running this hospital.
- It's too big a risk.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.667
Doctor Bloom asked me
to consult

00:15.711 --> 00:17.234
on the hematology patient.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.062
Her file says that
she received her heart

00:19.106 --> 00:20.629
from a Luna Goodwin.

00:20.672 --> 00:23.371
- Your sister--she gave me
a beautiful life.

00:23.414 --> 00:27.027
- She had me arrange this.

00:27.070 --> 00:29.246
- Max?

00:29.290 --> 00:31.161
Baby!

00:31.205 --> 00:32.510
Oh, my--help!

00:32.554 --> 00:34.251
Help!

00:54.793 --> 00:57.100
- We've got Marina Latimer,
mid 60s.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.449
Been down for three minutes.

00:58.493 --> 01:00.103
- It's her third time here
this week.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.757
- She went back into V-fib
right after I shocked her.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.107
- Charge to 200.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.413
Clear.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.721
Okay, I've got a pulse.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.549
Her heart's
a ticking time bomb.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.638
Let's put V-fib pads on her
and find Reynolds.

01:13.682 --> 01:16.119
He needs to put in
an ICD, today.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.126
- Yo, Dora.
Where's Max?

01:23.170 --> 01:24.780
- Out of pocket
for a few hours.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.477
- Oh, okay.
Well, I have a patient

01:26.521 --> 01:28.305
who needs an ICD surgery.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.220
Her insurance won't cover it
so I'm just gonna charge it

01:30.264 --> 01:31.656
to the Community Care Fund.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.397
- Max is the only one
who can approve surgeries

01:33.441 --> 01:34.616
from the Community Care Fund.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.574
- He's out of pocket
for a few hours.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.577
- Can this wait until
it doesn't get me fired?

01:39.621 --> 01:42.319
- Um, look, whenever there's
a surgery that needs to be done

01:42.363 --> 01:44.278
I just give Max a heads-up
and I do it, all right?

01:44.321 --> 01:45.844
He dots the "I's"
and crosses the "T's" later.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.455
We--we got a whole system.

01:47.498 --> 01:48.847
- He's been here
for like three weeks.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.415
- Yeah, that's how efficient
we are.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.766
- Dora, hi.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.464
Just on my way
to Max's office right now.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.206
- Yeah, he was out of pocket
for a few hours.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.381
- He's what?
Oh, shoot.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.643
No, really?

02:01.686 --> 02:03.427
Uh, as the
nurses' union liaison,

02:03.471 --> 02:05.255
I need to tell him that
the hospital-wide walkout

02:05.299 --> 02:06.778
was authorized just now
for today.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.519
- "Walkout"?

02:08.563 --> 02:09.825
- No, no, no.
It's a good--it's a good thing.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.783
Max gave them the idea.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.481
- Of course he did.
- Yeah, I probably should have

02:13.524 --> 02:15.265
led with that.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.745
Did you know that insurance
has covered over-the-counter

02:16.788 --> 02:18.616
emergency contraception
since 1996,

02:18.660 --> 02:20.314
and now all of a sudden,
out of the blue, they're like,

02:20.357 --> 02:22.794
"No, uh-uh.
Not without a prescription"?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.622
That's not fair, right?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.450
There's--there's no way
we're gonna let that slide.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
And yes, for the record,
"Norma Rae"

02:28.235 --> 02:30.193
is my favorite movie.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.325
Go, girl.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.370
- Dora, uh, I've been
texting Max,

02:33.414 --> 02:34.763
but he's not responding.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.634
- He's out of pocket
for a few hours.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.159
- But I need to talk to him.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.465
I've basically authorized

02:41.509 --> 02:43.772
a surgery that's not covered
by insurance, and I'm about

02:43.815 --> 02:45.556
to endure a walkout
from the nurses,

02:45.600 --> 02:49.212
so whatever you need right now,
I'm sure I can handle.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.605
- It's private.
- Dora.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.563
Dora, I've been looking
for Max.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.653
- Okay, I'm only gonna
say this once more:

02:55.697 --> 02:57.829
Max is out of pocket
for a few hours.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.223
Please, save your news,
questions,

03:00.267 --> 03:01.746
mysterious personal requests,
or whatever it is

03:01.790 --> 03:04.836
that you need, for his return.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.795
Thank you.

03:09.537 --> 03:10.886
- Dr. Panthaki.
Thank you

03:10.929 --> 03:12.844
for picking up Max's samples
in person.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.196
- But to be clear, this cooler
is full of Miller Lites, right?

03:16.239 --> 03:17.632
- Yes.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.938
Yes, because I'm the type
who drinks domestic.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.289
- So tell me, will this be
your first time

03:22.332 --> 03:23.638
seeing Lauryn Hill in concert?

03:23.681 --> 03:26.380
- Actually, no.
I've seen her several times.

03:27.381 --> 03:30.297
But never on a date.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.560
- So in your head,
this is a date, huh?

03:32.603 --> 03:33.865
That's interesting.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.390
- Just--just give me my ticket.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.349
- Actually,
let's do this properly.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.350
Get dressed up.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.570
Dinner.

03:42.613 --> 03:43.788
- Okay.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.877
- Great.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.317
- Well, I--I should go now.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.233
- Me, too.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.365
Oh, and we're going Dutch
on dinner, so make sure

03:55.409 --> 03:57.933
you bring some cash.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.983
- Max, are you on
your way back?

04:05.027 --> 04:06.985
Helen!

04:07.029 --> 04:09.510
Helen, can you hear me?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.294
- Georgia?
What's wrong?

04:11.338 --> 04:13.514
- It's Max.
He--he collapsed.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.472
He's not moving.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.734
- Does he have a pulse?

04:16.778 --> 04:19.259
- Okay.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.478
Yes.
- Did you call 911?

04:21.522 --> 04:24.307
- They're coming but, um,
the call dropped

04:24.351 --> 04:25.700
and I just didn't know
what to do.

04:25.743 --> 04:26.962
- Put your cheek
over his mouth.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.007
Do you feel air moving?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.619
There is, uh,

04:31.662 --> 04:34.839
like, a whistling--
a raspy sound.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.059
- Put the phone next
to his throat.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.892
- Georgia?
- Yes?

04:43.935 --> 04:46.329
- Georgia, Max's throat
is blocked.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.635
- What?
- You need to make

04:47.678 --> 04:49.593
a new path
so that he can breathe.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.335
- Okay.
- You're gonna cut a small hole

04:52.379 --> 04:54.337
in his throat...
- What?

04:54.381 --> 04:56.339
No.
No, I can't.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.341
- Yes, yes.
Yes, you can.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.038
You can, because I'm gonna
help you.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.779
Find something that can cut
a hole in his throat

05:01.823 --> 05:03.041
and a tube
to slide through it.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.608
- Find something.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.610
Okay.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.354
Uh...

05:16.359 --> 05:18.883
Oh, uh, I have a--

05:18.927 --> 05:20.320
I have a pocket knife.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.843
Oh, God.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.627
And a--and a plastic straw.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.977
- Use the knife to cut, um,
three inches.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.980
It doesn't have to be exact.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.941
- Here we go, Georgia.
- Okay.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.772
- Use your index finger.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.643
Find Max's Adam's apple.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.341
- Okay, I found it.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.603
- Feel down from there
until you come

05:42.646 --> 05:44.648
to a little indentation.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.955
Make a half-inch,
horizontal cut

05:46.998 --> 05:48.783
through that indentation.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.830
What if it's--
what if it's not clean?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.528
What if I give him
an infection?

05:54.571 --> 05:57.400
- Georgia--Georgia,
Max can't breathe.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.402
You need to help him breathe.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.886
You can do this.

06:04.929 --> 06:07.671
Okay.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.673
Oh, God.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
I did it.
I did it.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.156
- Good job.
- Oh...

06:14.199 --> 06:16.027
- Now, pinch the far edges
together.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.160
Use your finger to keep
the hole open

06:18.203 --> 06:20.858
and slide the tube halfway in.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
Oh, God.
Okay.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.560
- Air should be coming out

06:26.603 --> 06:28.126
of that tube.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.087
It's--it's not--

06:32.130 --> 06:34.611
it's not working.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.396
God, it's not working!

06:36.439 --> 06:37.962
It didn't work!
It didn't work!

06:39.834 --> 06:42.576
- You--you might just need
to help his lungs expand.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.708
Blow into the tube.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.669
Come on, come on.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.063
Oh, come on, come on.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.457
Come on.
Come on.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.721
Come on, come on, come on.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.464
Oh!
Oh, he...

07:03.118 --> 07:05.555
- He's breathing.
He's breathing.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.428
-  Oh, my God.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.562
Oh, good.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.000
Oh, good.

07:23.399 --> 07:26.576
- How long
was his airway obstructed?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.186
How long was he not breathing,
ma'am?

07:28.230 --> 07:31.755
- Uh, six or seven minutes,
maybe.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.715
- We got a possible
cerebral hypoxia!

07:34.758 --> 07:36.325
Let's pick up speed!

07:36.368 --> 07:37.935
- What does that mean?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.284
- Means there's
a big difference

07:39.328 --> 07:41.765
between six and seven minutes.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.653
- Mr. Mokrani?
- Yes.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.263
- How are you?
- Not great.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.743
- Yeah, let's have a look.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.788
Does that hurt, right there?
- Yes.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.050
- Yeah.
Fell during a show?

08:06.094 --> 08:07.399
- No.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.358
At the after-party.
- Ah.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.447
- I challenged another dancer
to a fouetté competition.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.363
- Mm-hmm.
- I can fouetté in my sleep,

08:14.406 --> 08:16.147
but in my sleep,
I'm neither wasted

08:16.191 --> 08:18.933
nor on a pool table.
- Oh, please.

08:18.976 --> 08:22.023
I was just as drunk and
on-a-pool-table as you were.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.373
- Know that you did not
out-dance me.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.245
- Basem, I out-danced you
so bad,

08:27.289 --> 08:29.030
you're in a hospital.
- Yeah, well, I don't know

08:29.073 --> 08:31.032
if it counts as out-dancing

08:31.075 --> 08:33.774
if he fell off a pool table.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.994
- Yeah, but I didn't.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.996
So, I out-danced him.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.086
- Dancing is the art
of not falling?

08:42.130 --> 08:44.654
I'm sorry, who are you?

08:47.788 --> 08:51.356
Uh, yeah, I'm...

08:51.400 --> 08:54.838
Just a guy challenging you
to a, uh...

08:54.882 --> 08:57.014
fouetté rematch.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.364
Don't worry, I took dance
all through...

08:59.408 --> 09:01.192
uh, never.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.025
- Hello?
- Yeah.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.679
- Don't you have
some medicine to practice?

09:09.723 --> 09:11.768
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, so, uh,

09:11.812 --> 09:13.770
you have a dislocated elbow.
Go ahead

09:13.814 --> 09:15.293
and take this pen
with your left hand.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.512
Now, grab it tight.
Hang on.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.470
- Ow! Oh!
- Okay?

09:18.514 --> 09:19.907
- Oof.
- Better?

09:19.950 --> 09:21.125
Yeah.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.736
- Yeah, good.
Okay, he's okay.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.955
I was thinking
loser buys dinner.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.915
Really?

09:27.958 --> 09:29.743
- I mean, yeah.
I'm not scared

09:29.786 --> 09:31.875
if you're not scared.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.013
Looks good.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.884
Looks pretty--pretty good.
- Okay, you go.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.407
- My turn?
- Yep.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.409
- This is embarrassing,
'cause I actually thought

09:44.453 --> 09:46.281
"fouetté" was a French dessert,

09:46.324 --> 09:48.065
so I didn't know that it was
that spin-y thing.

09:48.109 --> 09:51.242
That was way better
than what I thought it was.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.810
But, uh...

09:53.854 --> 09:55.290
excuse me.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.552
Uh, you're gonna go ahead
and ice that elbow

09:56.596 --> 09:59.990
and you're gonna be fine.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.905
Are you coming?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.385
- Um...

10:03.428 --> 10:05.517
it's 2:00 in the morning.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.041
- Yeah, but I gotta be
back here

10:07.084 --> 10:08.477
in three hours anyway--
and full disclosure,

10:08.520 --> 10:10.087
I can't afford
a real restaurant,

10:10.131 --> 10:12.829
so we were just headed
to the cafeteria regardless,

10:12.873 --> 10:15.266
but the Jell-O is phenomenal.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.750
You in?

10:41.336 --> 10:43.294
- Hey.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.297
What's with the T-shirts?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.951
- You said you were gonna
take time off

10:47.995 --> 10:49.300
to take care of yourself.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.476
- I am, and I will.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.000
I tried to talk to Max
this morning,

10:53.043 --> 10:54.305
but he's not here.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.916
- He's always here.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.353
- Well, right now he's not,
and I can't just

10:58.396 --> 11:01.617
stop running the ED, can I?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.011
- I feel so bad, all the work
you do on me.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.317
I've become this burden
to everyone.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.971
- No, no, you're not a burden.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.017
It's just that you have
mediocre insurance,

11:10.060 --> 11:11.627
and I think you should be
treated like you have

11:11.671 --> 11:14.456
Cadillac insurance,
so we're gonna cover you

11:14.499 --> 11:16.327
for an ICD implant.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.068
Today.
- For the whole surgery?

11:18.112 --> 11:19.504
What about
the anesthesiologist?

11:19.548 --> 11:21.506
Sometimes they get you
with the anesthesiologist.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.465
- For the whole surgery.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.597
- So glad Gertie
is doing better.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.512
Bye.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.863
both: Hello.
- Oh, nice T-shirt.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.603
- Thank you.
Power to the people, Vijay.

11:31.647 --> 11:34.519
- Ella was telling me
that I helped her save

11:34.563 --> 11:35.607
her crazy Chihuahua.

11:35.651 --> 11:38.132
- Oh.
All right, Ka-pooch.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.221
I didn't know you did work
on canines.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.526
That's cool.
- I don't.

11:41.570 --> 11:44.355
I gave her a little money
for the vet.

11:44.399 --> 11:48.142
- How much?
- $2,000.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.318
- American?

11:56.280 --> 11:59.588
- Oh, I gotta go,
but I'll see you in prep.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.376
- Sharpe!
What's the code?

12:05.420 --> 12:07.161
- It's Max.
- I'm sorry, what?

12:07.204 --> 12:08.945
- What happened?

12:08.989 --> 12:10.381
- I don't have all the details,
but he's collapsed.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.470
He's in a medevac
on his way here now.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.690
- Is it serious?
- I should get the trauma team.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.040
- They'll be here
in two minutes.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.476
There's something else,

12:18.520 --> 12:20.609
something that you all need
to know in order

12:20.652 --> 12:22.393
to treat him properly
when he arrives.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.655
- All right, Sharpe, what's--
what's going on?

12:26.702 --> 12:29.444
- Max has
squamous cell carcinoma.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.928
Advanced stages.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.715
The trauma team's
gonna meet us here.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.238
- No--whoa, hold on a second.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.631
- How long have you known
about this?

12:42.674 --> 12:44.415
- Since his first day.

12:44.459 --> 12:47.027
- Since his first day?
- Look, I--I know

12:47.070 --> 12:48.593
that this is shocking,
but whatever we're feeling,

12:48.637 --> 12:49.594
we're gonna have
to put it aside

12:49.638 --> 12:52.032
because we need to focus.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.540
- Hey, clear a path!

13:24.325 --> 13:26.283
- O2 stat's dropping.
- Okay, let's up oxygen

13:26.327 --> 13:28.155
to 100%.
- Push more fluid.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.373
- Does anybody know how long
he was out for?

13:29.417 --> 13:32.289
- Okay, everybody out
of my ED, now!

13:37.729 --> 13:41.124
- Should I page Dr. Candelario?
- No.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.127
Yes, yeah.
Page her, please.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.564
- On three.
One, two, three.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.176
- Monitor
for ischemic cascade.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.360
- Why hasn't he started chemo?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.144
- In two weeks he starts, uh,

14:01.188 --> 14:04.017
an immunotherapy trial.
- What?

14:04.060 --> 14:06.019
- Huh?
- Well, that's--

14:06.062 --> 14:07.542
that's what he wanted.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.587
- That's what he wanted?
- Yes, Floyd.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.372
He's the patient.
- Yeah, but he's also

14:11.415 --> 14:14.592
the medical director
of this entire hospital.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.595
Am I the only one who's
wondering what happens next?

14:17.639 --> 14:21.164
- What--what are you doing
out here?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.036
- Candelario is working on him.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.516
- Why?

14:25.560 --> 14:28.084
- Because I just got off
of back-to-back doubles,

14:28.128 --> 14:31.174
and Candelario
is an excellent doctor.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.046
- You pull doubles
all the time.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.700
- Max deserves to have a doctor
with fresh eyes.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.138
Do you disagree?

14:40.227 --> 14:42.707
- How is he?

14:42.751 --> 14:44.492
- We don't know yet.

14:44.535 --> 14:48.061
Might be hypoxia.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.367
- So, like most of you,
Doctor Sharpe told me

14:50.411 --> 14:53.109
about Max's condition,
and needless to say,

14:53.153 --> 14:55.677
I was a bit shocked,

14:55.720 --> 14:57.548
but we don't have time
to be shocked,

14:57.592 --> 14:59.115
or angry, or upset.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.725
We all have a hospital to run,

15:00.769 --> 15:04.468
and while Max is in there,
we need a leader out here,

15:04.512 --> 15:06.427
and that's gonna be me.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.647
Until further notice, I am
the new Medical Director

15:09.691 --> 15:12.128
of New Amsterdam.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.876
- I need surgery schedules,
staff rotation.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.138
I need the minutes
from the last

15:22.182 --> 15:23.748
department chair meeting.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.185
- That--that's gonna take
a little while

15:25.228 --> 15:27.709
to put together.
- Okay, then let's start

15:27.752 --> 15:29.972
with what Max
was overseeing today.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.887
- His hot list.
- Yeah.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.890
What's the hot list?
- It's his to-do list,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.979
but with a cooler name.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.329
- Ah.

15:39.373 --> 15:42.071
- I'll call it something else.
- Thank you.

15:47.642 --> 15:50.079
Don't worry,
I'm only temporary.

15:50.123 --> 15:53.996
I have several calls out for
more permanent replacements.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.998
- Dean Fulton, all this
is incredibly premature.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.305
When Max wakes up--
- If Max wakes up,

15:58.348 --> 16:00.220
he will still have cancer.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.048
He certainly didn't expect
to continue this job

16:02.091 --> 16:04.746
while undergoing chemo.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.749
Ah-hah.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.882
Of course he did.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.798
- So all you care about
is business.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.149
- Let me tell you something...

16:16.192 --> 16:18.107
every single day,
10,000 patients walk

16:18.151 --> 16:19.935
into this hospital
and its clinics.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.199
Our annual budget
is $1.5 billion,

16:23.243 --> 16:25.636
and the governor is demanding
that we cut it by 10%,

16:25.680 --> 16:28.030
which is really tough,
because our expenses come in

16:28.074 --> 16:30.032
well over $1.8 billion.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.687
Our infrastructure report
after Hurricane Sandy

16:32.730 --> 16:34.863
told us that we were sinking
into the East River,

16:34.906 --> 16:37.909
and will need $100 million

16:37.953 --> 16:40.651
infused within the next
two years so we don't end up

16:40.695 --> 16:44.046
like Bangladesh
after a monsoon!

16:44.090 --> 16:46.396
And the one guy who's in charge
of this whole show

16:46.440 --> 16:49.965
is lying in Trauma One
with a tube down his throat.

16:51.184 --> 16:54.361
And what about
a succession plan?

16:54.404 --> 16:57.146
He knew he was sick.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.105
You knew he was sick.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.064
Someone should have had
a plan in place.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.110
Right?

17:04.153 --> 17:06.286
What?

17:14.250 --> 17:16.122
- I just made us the greatest--

17:16.165 --> 17:17.427
- Max has had a set-back.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.255
His throat closed up.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.996
- Where is he?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.824
- In the trauma unit.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.131
- Well, uh, is he responsive?
- Still unconscious,

17:25.174 --> 17:26.828
but at least
he's breathing again.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.177
- How long was he down?

17:28.221 --> 17:30.136
- Six or seven minutes.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.312
I need to ask a favor.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.401
- Anything.
- I need you to move up

17:34.444 --> 17:36.142
Max's start date.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.665
- To when?

17:37.708 --> 17:40.320
- To tomorrow.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.105
- Helen, I just got the cells.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.455
- I know, I know I'm asking
a lot, but if Max is gonna

17:45.499 --> 17:47.283
keep running this hospital,
then he needs to be

17:47.327 --> 17:50.025
in your trial.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.248
- Let me see what I can do.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.171
- Monitoring.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.348
Decompression.

18:08.391 --> 18:12.352
- Dr. Candelario is suctioning
Max's lungs.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.310
He's really lucky
you were there.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.007
- Stand by.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.357
- Hey, you want
to step outside?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.489
Get some fresh air?

18:19.533 --> 18:23.145
- What's the difference
between six and seven minutes?

18:25.321 --> 18:27.193
- "Six and seven minutes"?

18:27.236 --> 18:30.370
- EMT said he might
have hypoxia.

18:32.415 --> 18:35.070
I don't know how to pray.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.423
I'm not religious, but I wish

18:40.467 --> 18:42.512
I knew how to pray.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.863
- We've got blood.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.911
- What's happening?
What's happening?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.217
Could be ARDS.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.437
- Oh, God!

19:07.972 --> 19:10.105
- Hey.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.020
- Ooh, you're seriously
taking me to the theater

19:12.063 --> 19:13.543
in your scrubs.
- I'm on call,

19:13.587 --> 19:17.243
but when I put
this jacket on, like so...

19:21.029 --> 19:22.422
- You're looking at me like
you can't quite believe

19:22.465 --> 19:25.338
you're dating somebody
so stylish.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.078
- Just like looking at you.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.255
- Hmm.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.348
- So, are you excited to see
Pina Bausch's company?

19:35.391 --> 19:36.914
- My God, I can't stop
saying it.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.525
Pina Bausch.
Pina Bausch.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.091
Pina Bausch.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.441
Hey, you wanna know
an interesting thing

19:41.484 --> 19:43.530
about Pina Bausch?
- Pina Bausch.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.793
- It's super rare
for her company to be

19:45.836 --> 19:47.360
performing on a Monday.
- Oh, is it?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Weir-sch.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.799
- Theaters are dark on Monday.
- Did not know that.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.844
- You wanna know another thing?
- I sure do.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.455
- Her company performed
just last night

19:55.498 --> 19:57.152
at the Kansallisooppera.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.980
- And that's even more fun
to say.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.330
- It's also in Finland.
- Really?

20:01.374 --> 20:02.984
- Mm-hmm.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.900
- Now, it sounds like
you don't think we're going

20:05.943 --> 20:08.207
to see Pina Bausch.

20:09.947 --> 20:12.298
- What is this?

20:12.341 --> 20:13.342
- What's that--what?

20:13.386 --> 20:16.084
Oh.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.569
Uh...

20:24.310 --> 20:27.313
Yeah, you got me.
There's no show.

20:29.358 --> 20:33.188
Just a guy who can't quite
believe his luck.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.158
- Really?

20:47.202 --> 20:48.986
- Really.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.450
- Will you marry me?

21:19.408 --> 21:21.018
Not even gonna check that.

21:21.062 --> 21:24.021
I'm not even gonna look
until you say something.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.284
No rush.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.502
Someone could be dying...

21:26.546 --> 21:28.678
- Right now.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.160
- Yes, I'll marry you.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.162
- Yes?
- Yes.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.040
Oh, my God,
it's beautiful.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.346
So beautiful.

21:47.262 --> 21:48.611
- Hey, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.091
- Go, go, go. Jacket.
- Yeah, but I--yeah.

21:50.134 --> 21:53.399
I'll make it quick, I promise.

21:53.442 --> 21:56.097
She said yes!

22:15.638 --> 22:18.075
- You know--hey, hey,
I've been thinking about this.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.599
This kind of explains a lot,
don't you think?

22:19.642 --> 22:21.949
- What?
- The--all the crazy changes

22:21.992 --> 22:24.081
he made around here.
That explains a lot of it.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.040
Yeah, I mean, like, who--
who forms a cardio unit

22:26.083 --> 22:27.476
that doesn't care about money,

22:27.520 --> 22:29.348
or who--who puts fruits
and vegetables

22:29.391 --> 22:31.132
in vending machines?

22:31.175 --> 22:32.612
Who encourages their own staff
to stage a walkout?

22:32.655 --> 22:35.136
Do you know what I mean?
It's a--it's a dying man

22:35.179 --> 22:37.573
saying "screw you"
to the system, that's who.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.314
- What do you want me to say?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.576
- I don't--anything.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.317
Just join
the conversation, man.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.449
Or are you just gonna
stand there staring at me

22:43.492 --> 22:44.754
like the old Kapoor?

22:44.798 --> 22:46.321
- I was not aware
there was a new Kapoor.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.018
- Oh, yes.
No, there are two

22:48.062 --> 22:49.977
very distinct Kapoors.
The old Kapoor was this

22:50.020 --> 22:51.631
solemn fellow
who rarely spoke to people,

22:51.674 --> 22:53.981
and then Max comes
on the scene and bam,

22:54.024 --> 22:55.591
all of a sudden
you're smiley-face guy

22:55.635 --> 22:58.246
who randomly lends $2,000
to the coffee girl

22:58.289 --> 23:00.248
for her quote-unquote "dog."

23:00.291 --> 23:03.338
- You have no right
to talk about Ella's character.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.254
- Except I do, because she took
$2,000 from you.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.647
- I gave it to her,

23:07.690 --> 23:10.345
and for the records,
there is no old or new Kapoor.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.565
There is only Kapoor.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.052
- Doctor...

23:22.096 --> 23:24.707
So I see that your patient,
Marina Latimer,

23:24.751 --> 23:26.579
is scheduled for an ICD.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.668
- Yes.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.801
- Why is it being charged
to the Community Care Fund?

23:31.845 --> 23:34.064
- Because her insurance
is garbage.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.544
- Oh.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.112
I don't see Max's signature
anywhere on the document.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.679
- Right, yeah, he would have
approved that

23:39.722 --> 23:42.203
had he not collapsed.
- Right.

23:42.246 --> 23:45.380
Is she stable?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.686
- Yes.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.296
- This is not
a necessary surgery.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.690
- Okay, Mrs. Latimer
has been in and out

23:50.733 --> 23:52.822
of this hospital
more than her own home.

23:52.866 --> 23:57.218
This ICD will completely
change her life.

23:57.261 --> 23:59.481
- Doctor,
a public hospital's job

23:59.525 --> 24:02.136
is not to change
people's lives.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.530
It's to save people's lives.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.708
We will not be paying
for this surgery.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.237
- Oh, Dean.
Hey, Dean, hi.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.891
You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.022
- Hi.
What's up?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.589
- How you holding up, kiddo?

24:20.633 --> 24:22.286
- Uh--uh, you know.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.811
Terribly.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.552
- We go way back, don't we?

24:26.595 --> 24:29.206
- Mm-hmm.
Am I fired?

24:29.250 --> 24:30.947
- Ignatius, come on.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.645
- Well, usually when people say
"we go way back,"

24:32.688 --> 24:34.211
it's because you're not going
way forward.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.170
- This is about the nurses
and the walkout.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.259
- Oh, good, right.
Yes.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.696
Um, HCC needs to come back
to the table

24:40.740 --> 24:41.958
so we can make some progress.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.786
- They're not coming back
to the table.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.701
- Well, if the nurses
stand together, we have a shot.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.181
- They're not coming back
to the table.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.705
HCC wouldn't tell Max,
but they told me.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.229
If the nurses walk,
then I have no choice.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.057
I just have to replace them.
- You can't.

24:54.101 --> 24:56.146
You can't replace 1,600 nurses.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.061
- So I'll have to close
the wards that we can't staff.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.889
I'm gonna have to send
the doctors home,

24:59.933 --> 25:01.282
send custodial home.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
People are gonna lose
their jobs, and for what?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.982
- We work in healthcare,
and we can't provide

25:06.026 --> 25:07.723
our own people
with comprehensive healthcare.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.159
- I want you to listen
to me now.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.248
With Max down,
this is not the right time.

25:11.292 --> 25:14.077
Convince the nurses
to stand down,

25:14.121 --> 25:16.906
or else everyone--
patients included--

25:16.950 --> 25:19.909
everyone is gonna
pay the price.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.955
- Fine.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.392
All right, fine.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.400
- Hey, uh, can I get an update?

25:32.443 --> 25:34.141
For, uh, Georgia?

25:34.184 --> 25:36.143
- He's still unresponsive.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.101
We're having a hard time
getting his heart rate up.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.363
- Well, maybe I can help.

25:39.407 --> 25:42.149
- He's not your patient.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.675
- He's my friend.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.853
- Can I talk to you, please?

25:59.166 --> 26:01.777
Then why did you pass him off?

26:01.821 --> 26:03.736
- Max...

26:03.779 --> 26:05.781
Max needed fresh eyes.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.827
I've known you six years

26:07.870 --> 26:10.786
and I have never once heard you
refer to your eyes

26:10.830 --> 26:12.309
as not fresh.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.876
- My shift was over.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.183
- Lauren.

26:17.837 --> 26:20.404
Why did you pass Max off?

26:30.197 --> 26:34.157
I- I've been working
at Bronx General a lot...

26:34.201 --> 26:36.899
and working here a lot.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.337
I don't know, the last--

26:40.381 --> 26:44.167
last few weeks it was...

26:44.211 --> 26:46.735
it was too much.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.781
I hit a wall.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.913
- Okay.

26:50.957 --> 26:53.176
- And, um...

26:58.225 --> 27:01.141
I've been taking
a little bit more...

27:01.184 --> 27:04.187
Adderall than prescribed.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.276
- How much more?
- I don't know.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.018
Just more.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.325
But I'm handling it, okay?

27:11.368 --> 27:13.109
I'm gonna--I'm gonna take
some time off,

27:13.153 --> 27:14.720
I'm gonna figure it out.

27:14.763 --> 27:17.723
I was gonna talk to Max
this morning, but...

27:19.725 --> 27:22.292
Anyway...

27:22.336 --> 27:25.208
that's why I passed him off.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.789
- So, do you really think

27:40.833 --> 27:43.139
Ella doesn't have a dog?

27:44.750 --> 27:47.317
Are you serious right now?

27:47.361 --> 27:49.842
Is that--
is that a serious question?

27:49.885 --> 27:53.062
New Amsterdam
is upside-down right now.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.717
Max is in the ICU,
the dean wants me to tank

27:55.761 --> 27:59.199
the walkout, and you're focused
on some woman's Chihuahua?

28:00.243 --> 28:01.810
Come on, man.
- So you do think

28:01.854 --> 28:04.421
she has a dog.
- I don't care.

28:04.465 --> 28:08.077
Dog, no dog, it doesn't matter.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.513
- It matters to me.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.298
- Why?

28:11.341 --> 28:13.909
Why does it matter?

28:14.823 --> 28:16.477
- Because...

28:16.520 --> 28:19.219
there is a new Kapoor.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.919
- I think there's
a new Iggy, too.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.446
- So what do you think this...

28:29.490 --> 28:32.885
new Iggy and new Kapoor
should do?

28:50.163 --> 28:52.774
- Are you Dr. Goodwin's wife?

28:52.818 --> 28:55.429
- Yes.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.344
- I--I just want to say
that your husband

28:57.387 --> 28:59.825
is the first man
in his position...

29:01.174 --> 29:04.220
To care about the janitors.

29:07.136 --> 29:09.922
We wait for good news.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.631
- Hey, hey, hey!
I come bearing

29:23.674 --> 29:26.329
the sweetest cantaloupe
you have ever had.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.636
I know your, uh, cravings
haven't started yet,

29:28.679 --> 29:31.160
but when they do,
I feel like they're gonna be

29:31.204 --> 29:33.075
really melon-heavy.

29:33.119 --> 29:36.339
I don't know why,
I just get that vibe.

29:36.383 --> 29:39.081
You okay?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.609
What's wrong?
Is it the baby?

29:47.176 --> 29:50.484
- When I came home
there was a FedEx waiting...

29:51.572 --> 29:55.141
with contracts from
New Amsterdam Medical Center.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.579
Good news.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.974
You got the job...

30:02.017 --> 30:04.890
that I didn't know
you'd even applied for.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.023
- I didn't--I didn't apply,
it just happened.

30:08.067 --> 30:11.200
- When was the interview?

30:11.244 --> 30:12.636
A week ago...
- A week ago.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.682
- But, uh, look,
the dean of medicine called me

30:14.725 --> 30:17.032
out of nowhere and he said,
"I need an answer right away."

30:17.076 --> 30:19.208
And I figure why tell you...
- "Why tell me"?

30:19.252 --> 30:21.689
- If I don't know--
- We made a promise, Max.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.647
Remember?

30:24.953 --> 30:28.043
We were going to raise
this child together.

30:29.262 --> 30:32.613
We were going to put
our careers second.

30:35.616 --> 30:38.401
I gave up everything.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.447
This job is the opposite
of that.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.102
- I'm gonna make it work.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.712
- Really?

30:44.755 --> 30:47.149
It is the largest
public hospital in the country.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.108
- And I'm gonna figure out
how to squeeze everything in.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.892
- Oh, great.
Will you, Max?

30:50.936 --> 30:52.720
Will you figure out how
you can squeeze me in and--

30:52.763 --> 30:53.939
and your child?

30:53.982 --> 30:57.072
- That's not what I meant.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.118
- Well, that's what's
gonna happen.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.337
- By the time this baby
gets here, I'm gonna have

31:01.381 --> 31:03.122
this place running smoothly.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.558
I can come home early.

31:04.601 --> 31:07.213
I can take weekends.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.692
- You won't.

31:08.736 --> 31:12.435
Not unless I'm sick,
not unless the baby's sick.

31:12.479 --> 31:15.395
That is the only way
you will stop,

31:15.438 --> 31:17.614
and just...

31:17.658 --> 31:20.095
be.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.357
- And just be what, Georgia?

31:21.401 --> 31:23.011
This is--this is the life
of a doctor.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.621
This is my life.

31:24.665 --> 31:27.233
- No, it's not.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.496
It's not.

31:30.671 --> 31:33.282
We know doctors--we know
dozens of doctors--

31:33.326 --> 31:37.721
and this is not their life.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.680
You're obsessed, Max.
You are.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.335
It's not healthy.

31:42.378 --> 31:45.381
It's like an addiction.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.651
I know you love me.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.663
But when the hospital calls...

32:07.664 --> 32:10.450
it always wins.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.639
I can't let my daughter
grow up

32:25.682 --> 32:28.381
feeling like she's not
the most important thing

32:28.424 --> 32:30.644
in her father's life.

32:32.472 --> 32:35.562
I can't do this anymore, Max.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.151
- Georgia...

32:59.194 --> 33:01.327
with your permission,
I would like to provide Max

33:01.370 --> 33:03.372
with a small prayer.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.332
What is that?

33:51.812 --> 33:53.770
Did I hurt him?

33:58.471 --> 34:00.908
- No.

34:00.951 --> 34:04.346
I think you might have
just saved his life.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.919
- It's called
a paraneoplastic syndrome.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.790
- The way his skin got red
and swollen

34:13.834 --> 34:15.183
where you kissed him?

34:15.227 --> 34:16.706
That's happening everywhere
in his body.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.143
Everything's becoming red
and swollen,

34:18.186 --> 34:21.363
and shutting down.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.235
- From the cancer?

34:23.278 --> 34:24.845
- Yes.

34:24.888 --> 34:28.153
But now that we know
what it is, we can treat it.

34:28.196 --> 34:31.199
- And he'll be okay, right?

34:34.246 --> 34:37.379
- Uh, we'll have
to wait and see.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.779
- Let's let the HCC
know what we want!

34:45.822 --> 34:47.650
all: We'll march all day!

34:47.694 --> 34:48.956
We'll march all night!

34:48.999 --> 34:51.785
'Cause birth control
is our right!

34:51.828 --> 34:53.221
We'll march all day!

34:53.265 --> 34:55.005
We'll march all night!

34:55.049 --> 34:58.661
- Louder!

34:58.705 --> 35:00.141
All right, come on!
This one's for the one and only

35:00.185 --> 35:02.143
true Medical Director
of New Amsterdam:

35:02.187 --> 35:04.798
Max Goodwin!
Let's make it bigger!

35:04.841 --> 35:07.322
all: March all day!
March all night!

35:07.366 --> 35:09.759
- You know, I just--
I think Max would have hated

35:09.803 --> 35:11.674
to see a bunch of clever
homemade protest signs

35:11.718 --> 35:13.850
go to waste, you know?

35:13.894 --> 35:15.939
You look like you're a small.
Right, sir?

35:15.983 --> 35:17.985
There.
For you.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.292
all: March all night!
'Cause birth control...

35:20.335 --> 35:23.077
- Forceps.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.426
Suture.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.823
Reynolds?

35:29.866 --> 35:32.130
Is that Marina Latimer?

35:32.173 --> 35:33.827
- It is.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.177
- So you're willing
to risk your job

35:36.221 --> 35:37.831
