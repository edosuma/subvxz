00:33.000 --> 00:34.199
Rocko!

00:45.846 --> 00:48.047
Hey, come on, little guy!
I'm a nice vet!

00:49.250 --> 00:51.984
So then, do you think
today will be the day?

00:52.019 --> 00:53.497
Well, there's no way
to predict a match

00:53.521 --> 00:55.754
with any degree of certainty,
Mrs. Gilbert,

00:55.790 --> 00:58.023
but the day will come,
I promise you that.

00:58.059 --> 01:00.159
All right, well, let's
meet these new candidates.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.761
Well, you're the candidate,
Mrs. Gilbert.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.164
- The dogs need to meet you.
- Of course.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.202
Rocko!
Hey, you, stop!

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
Hey, Rocko!

01:18.879 --> 01:20.913
'Scuse me.
Fugitive on the loose...

01:20.948 --> 01:24.683
yea high, responds to the name
of Rocko, apparently.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.418
Carly?

01:27.488 --> 01:28.620
Dan, hi.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.924
- I didn't know you were in town.
- Yeah... last week.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.059
I'm taking over
my grandpa's clinic.

01:34.095 --> 01:37.196
Your sister roped me in,
said you guys needed some help,

01:37.231 --> 01:40.899
but, seems I've lost
my first patient already.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.269
Not yet, apparently.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.737
Excuse me.
Sorry!

01:45.773 --> 01:47.873
Rocko?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.041
Friend?

01:49.076 --> 01:50.909
Used to be.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.424
Are you ready
for your interview?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.448
Yeah.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.315
Hey there, little guy.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.661
You'll get used to it.
They're clever...

02:09.697 --> 02:11.062
especially this little guy.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.598
Thanks, Michelle.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.033
Man, you sure do run fast
for having such short little legs.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.636
Okay, come on.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.871
Let's see why you're so upset.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.943
Oh, well, that's why
he's so sensitive.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.189
Poor little guy's
got an ear infection,

02:26.213 --> 02:27.779
but I am going
to fix that right up.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.681
Your grandpa must be so happy
that you're back.

02:29.717 --> 02:30.983
He is...

02:31.018 --> 02:32.184
so much so, that he wants me

02:32.219 --> 02:33.497
to live in his house
permanently.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.855
He has no idea why I would
want to get my own place.

02:36.891 --> 02:37.934
That's sweet.
He's probably just lonely.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.459
Yeah.
You know, I keep trying

02:40.494 --> 02:42.005
to convince him
to adopt one of these dogs.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.263
Oh, well, you should set him up
with my brother.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.597
After all,
he is Dan the Dog Man.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.866
Dan... the Dog Man?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.637
Everyone's favorite matchmaker,
the Canine Connector.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.572
Just wait.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.317
Yeah, no, I already
ran into him... literally.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.508
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.342
Hey, how come
you didn't tell him

02:57.378 --> 02:59.444
I was the new
volunteer veterinarian?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.824
I just, you know,
wanted it to be a surprise.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.116
- Why?
- I don't know.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.351
Michelle...

03:06.387 --> 03:07.619
that was high school.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.001
All right, let's listen
to the old ticker.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.791
Come here.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.666
I mean, this is seriously
probably the nicest shelter

03:20.701 --> 03:22.034
I've ever been in.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.803
- How do you afford this?
- We have a secret weapon.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.005
A secret weapon?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.707
You're going to love this.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.809
We have a genuine TV star

03:30.844 --> 03:32.255
that does a weekly
segment on the news,

03:32.279 --> 03:34.413
brings in a lot of donations.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.517
Oh, my goodness.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.354
She is just the most adorable
thing I have ever seen?

03:43.857 --> 03:45.324
Meet Cujo.

03:46.594 --> 03:50.095
Oh, no, I don't believe that.
That couldn't possibly be true.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.166
Her real name is Beasley,

03:54.201 --> 03:56.835
and even Dan can't
find a match for her.

03:56.870 --> 03:57.836
Let's go.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.904
Okay...

03:58.939 --> 04:01.340
- It's about to start.
- It's about to start?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.045
What is all this?

04:07.081 --> 04:09.414
Welcome to "Friday's
Forever Friend" weekly segment.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.751
Your secret weapon?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.953
Just wait...

04:14.989 --> 04:17.589
We're live in 30 seconds!
Where's our star?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.925
- I thought Dan was the...
- Yeah, he is.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.493
It's just...
she doesn't know it yet.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.096
She?

04:24.131 --> 04:27.399
Right here!
Makeup has to be right, people.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.271
Oh, come on. Kristi Waters?
The Queen of Mean?

04:32.306 --> 04:34.306
I told you you'd love it.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.341
Ten seconds...

04:37.311 --> 04:39.111
She was always posing
for a camera,

04:39.146 --> 04:40.746
even when there wasn't one.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.247
It gets even better.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.450
Hi, everyone,
it's the end of the week,

04:45.486 --> 04:48.987
and that means it's time to meet
"Friday's Forever Friend".

04:49.023 --> 04:50.834
I'm here as always
with Dan "the Dog Man" Landis,

04:50.858 --> 04:54.037
the Canine Connector,
at the Forever Friends Shelter

04:54.061 --> 04:58.930
where it's time to find
the perfect match for you!

04:58.966 --> 05:02.601
<i>So, Dan, just who is
this adorable little girl</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:04.069
<i>we get to meet today?</i>

05:04.104 --> 05:06.349
<i>Well, Kristi, I'll agree
that this puppy is very cute,</i>

05:06.373 --> 05:07.472
<i>but I've got to tell you,</i>

05:07.508 --> 05:10.175
<i>this girl is a guy,
and his name is Bob.</i>

05:10.210 --> 05:12.110
<i>Bob?</i>

05:12.146 --> 05:13.679
<i>Who names a puppy "Bob"?</i>

05:13.714 --> 05:17.916
Actually, my sister, Michelle, and
she named Bob's brother "Stan," so...

05:17.951 --> 05:19.751
I think they might grow up
to be accountants.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.455
Oh, my...

05:23.490 --> 05:25.657
- Here, you want to hold him?
- Of course...

05:28.028 --> 05:33.265
Bob, you are the most
gorgeous widdle guy ever!

05:33.300 --> 05:35.634
Bob's here looking for
someone who likes to play

05:35.669 --> 05:36.968
and is good at throwing sticks.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.505
If you're lucky enough
to have Bob pick you,

05:40.541 --> 05:42.641
then Bob's adoption will be
easy and affordable.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.311
And that's why we love
to show all the folks at home...

05:46.347 --> 05:47.946
"Friday's Forever Friend".

05:47.981 --> 05:50.048
I'll be back next week
with Dan the Dog Man

05:50.084 --> 05:53.218
to introduce you
to another lovable pooch

05:53.253 --> 05:55.387
looking for a forever home.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.622
For Channel 7 News,
I'm Kristi Waters,

05:57.658 --> 06:02.327
saying, "Make man's best friend
your best friend".

06:03.731 --> 06:04.763
And clear!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.144
- Can somebody take this, please?
- Here, I got him. I got him.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.836
Wait...
she hates dogs?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.971
Yeah...
it gets better.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.407
I wish you wouldn't make me
hold them like that.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.042
How many times
do I have to tell you?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.577
Sorry, but it works.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.847
You're lucky
you're so dang cute.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.284
- What?
- Yep.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.490
Hey, Carly.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.058
I'll take him.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.230
Carly Monroe.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.766
You're...
exactly the same.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.434
So are you.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.837
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- So will I.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.573
This is Kristi Waters!

06:48.609 --> 06:50.442
Seriously?

06:50.477 --> 06:53.245
Yes.
Yes, of course.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.214
Absolutely.
I'll be there.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.183
Thank you so much!

06:58.218 --> 06:59.384
Bye-bye!

07:00.721 --> 07:02.521
- I'm going to New York!
- You got the job?

07:02.556 --> 07:05.757
Yes! I can't believe it!
It's actually happening!

07:05.793 --> 07:08.727
My head is spinning!
They want me!

07:08.762 --> 07:11.096
Welcome to the Kristi Show.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.798
Exactly!
Well, not right away.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.600
I'll be a field reporter to start,
but not for long.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.103
New York City!

07:18.138 --> 07:22.240
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you!

07:22.276 --> 07:26.111
Come on, Dan the Dog Man,
we are going out to celebrate.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.814
Should I tell her the doggy
made a messy on her shirt.

07:28.849 --> 07:29.849
No.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.608
Oh, boy.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.012
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Carly!

08:01.048 --> 08:04.349
- I think I burned dinner.
- I love burnt.

08:04.384 --> 08:07.152
Yeah, well,
this is beyond burnt.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.688
- Will you settle for a salad?
- Yeah. Good idea.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.323
Great.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.259
- How'd it go at the shelter?
- Wonderful.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.805
It was really great
seeing Michelle again,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.062
and I've missed her.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.198
You know, I saw Dan's segment.
He's good, isn't he? It's fun.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.867
Yep.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.802
And...

08:23.837 --> 08:25.804
And what?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.607
How was it seeing him
after all these years?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.942
- Fine.
- Fine?

08:30.978 --> 08:32.443
Grandpa...

08:32.479 --> 08:36.615
All right, none of my business.
Just happy you're back.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.616
Well, I'm really happy
to be back, too.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.719
Maybe you can convince Mom
to move home, too.

08:42.188 --> 08:46.324
Your mom loves the sun.
She's a snowbird forever.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.193
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.030
All right.
What is it?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.032
Nothing!
I'm fine.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.203
Okay, you know, actually,

08:57.237 --> 08:58.515
I'm going to run upstairs
and change really quick.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.071
I'll be right back.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.551
You know, you don't have
to find your own place.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.541
You can stay here.

09:02.576 --> 09:06.211
- Yeah. I know.
- Okay.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.425
"You haven't changed a bit,
Carly Monroe".

10:42.609 --> 10:44.275
Thanks.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.245
So, Dan and Kristi Waters.
How does that even happen?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.491
There must have been
some sort of tear

10:48.515 --> 10:49.748
in the time-space continuum.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.349
Clearly.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.265
I mean, they don't even have
anything in common.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.756
She's still just as pretentious
as she was in high school,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.324
and the fact
that she hates dogs...

10:59.359 --> 11:00.370
how is that even
acceptable to him?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.361
I mean, I just... I don't...
what?

11:03.397 --> 11:05.697
You're still crushing
on my brother, aren't you?

11:05.732 --> 11:07.699
I am not crushing on him.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.935
Your face just turned
two shades of pink.

11:10.971 --> 11:11.971
I don't do pink.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.171
Really?

11:13.206 --> 11:16.341
- One shade.
- At least.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.022
Well, it's not... it's not like
I don't care about his well-being.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.513
Well, the way you looked at him
yesterday, you know,

11:21.548 --> 11:23.548
had nothing to do
with his well-being.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.316
And the way he looks
at Kristi Waters

11:25.352 --> 11:27.352
had nothing to do with mine...

11:27.387 --> 11:28.820
the way all guys look at Kristi.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.157
- That hair, those teeth...
- That beautiful face?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.658
So symmetrical.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.193
Doesn't matter.

11:35.228 --> 11:39.798
She's moving to a distant
galaxy far, far away,

11:39.833 --> 11:42.567
and long-distance relationships
in distant galaxies

11:42.602 --> 11:44.803
never work.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.598
You and Dan, of all
people, should know that.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.509
- Your timing is perfect.
- My timing?

11:51.278 --> 11:54.112
Michelle, I did not move
back here to be with Dan.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.082
We're not in high school
anymore.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.818
Think we're, like,
all still in high school.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.065
Doesn't matter.
You can deny it all you want,

12:02.089 --> 12:03.199
but there is a reason
why you haven't fallen in love,

12:03.223 --> 12:05.990
gotten married,
had kids, all of that.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.028
Why?
Why?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.032
No, it's not like that.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.602
No, Dan and I,
we had something great,

12:17.637 --> 12:19.871
and then we went off
to college...

12:19.906 --> 12:20.906
life happened...

12:23.310 --> 12:24.275
You know what I think it is?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.176
I think it's just
that I don't want to settle

12:25.212 --> 12:27.679
for anything less
than how I felt for him,

12:27.714 --> 12:29.058
and that's... that's it.
That's all.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.749
That's end of story.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.884
But all stories that are good
deserve a sequel.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.352
Michelle!

12:34.387 --> 12:36.087
I am happy with my life.
Do not meddle.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.522
No, I'm not.
I'm not meddling.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.258
You... you are a meddler.
You always meddle.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.426
I've got to go.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.729
Do you want to come over
tonight, for dinner?

12:43.764 --> 12:45.296
Okay, sure.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.865
Yeah? Can cook up
a little love pasta.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.434
- Would you stop!
- All right, I'm going.

13:15.629 --> 13:16.629
Hey.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.130
Great.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.610
I see you dressed up
for the occasion.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.200
What occasion?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.437
Come in.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.407
I'm not up to something.
Nothing's going on.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.677
So I thought we would do
my famous spinach pasta.

13:32.712 --> 13:36.114
- Famous where?
- Everywhere.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.182
Hey, kid.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.753
- Hi there, kid! Hey.
- Hey.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.288
Hi!

13:43.323 --> 13:45.857
Using your old nicknames, I see.

13:50.163 --> 13:50.995
Yeah, no...

13:51.031 --> 13:53.531
I just invited Dan
because I figured

13:53.567 --> 13:55.044
you two have barely had
a chance to catch up.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.612
Sorry, I didn't want
to crash the party.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.269
Oh, no.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.673
No, I'm really happy to see you.
I just...

14:01.708 --> 14:04.542
I would've dressed up
a bit for the occasion.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.744
I'll be right back.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.281
You two, do your thing.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.518
- So...
- So...

14:16.256 --> 14:18.523
So... are you here
for good, or...?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.992
Yeah, yeah, that's the plan...
you know,

14:21.027 --> 14:24.329
assuming my grandfather
actually ever retires.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.198
Carly the veterinarian.
Who would have thought?

14:27.234 --> 14:30.201
Dan the Dog Man.
Who would have thought?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.604
- Well, you started it.
- Me?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.005
Yeah, when we were kids,
remember?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.520
That puppy that got swept into
the creek behind your house?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.844
Yeah.

14:39.880 --> 14:40.745
You know, the poor thing
would've drowned

14:40.780 --> 14:41.613
if you hadn't jumped in.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.147
You mean,
if you hadn't pushed me in.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.582
You did!

14:44.618 --> 14:47.752
Well, I, you know...
at least you saved the dog.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.020
Yeah.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.559
- Been saving them ever since.
- Yeah, every Friday.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.038
The Friday thing,
that's kind of silly, isn't it?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.161
No!

14:57.197 --> 14:58.162
Hey, it works...

14:58.198 --> 15:00.765
and truth is,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
I kind of hate
being on television.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.002
Really?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.104
Well, I thought it was great,
you know.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.805
You're... a natural...

15:11.745 --> 15:12.745
like your girlfriend.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.747
- Yeah, Kristi.
- Yeah.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.949
Well, yeah, she lives for it.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.717
She always has lived for it,
I guess...

15:21.288 --> 15:22.153
But you know what?

15:22.188 --> 15:24.722
She helps raise
a lot of money, so...

15:24.758 --> 15:26.758
Well, that's really
considerate of her,

15:26.793 --> 15:28.793
since she seems to hate dogs.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.763
- Hate's a pretty strong word.
- Not when it comes to Kristi.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.231
You haven't changed a bit.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.828
I'd take that as a compliment,
if I were you.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.104
- Well, it was meant as one.
- I know.

15:42.842 --> 15:45.109
- Four.
- Four what?

15:47.681 --> 15:50.315
- Four plates.
- Why four?

15:50.350 --> 15:51.627
Hello?

15:51.651 --> 15:54.052
- You didn't.
- She wanted to come.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.954
Dan!

15:57.257 --> 16:00.124
Kristi!
Looking great.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.160
Thanks for coming.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.229
Hello, everyone.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.767
So sweet of you to do this.

16:09.803 --> 16:14.005
- I mean, it's just dinner.
- No, it's not.

16:14.040 --> 16:14.906
I mean, we could have gone
to a nice restaurant

16:14.941 --> 16:16.240
or something,

16:16.276 --> 16:18.242
but this is very...
thoughtful...

16:19.679 --> 16:21.980
and honestly, unexpected.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.848
I didn't think you'd approve...

16:23.883 --> 16:25.984
not that Dan needs
your approval.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.519
Am I missing something?

16:30.123 --> 16:33.424
- You haven't even told her?
- Told me what?

16:33.460 --> 16:37.028
Well, first, I'm needed in
New York sooner than expected.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.596
We're moving
at the end of the month.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.543
You mean you're moving
at the end of the month.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.869
No... we.
Us, together...

16:44.904 --> 16:46.137
but that's not the big news.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.439
The big news is...

16:49.642 --> 16:52.110
we're getting married!

16:52.145 --> 16:54.379
Married?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.624
I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.116
- We just decided this morning.
- Decided?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.151
Yeah.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.652
You're getting married?

17:01.688 --> 17:04.255
Yeah!
It's exciting, huh?

17:05.325 --> 17:06.691
Married!

17:06.726 --> 17:09.627
- You can't move to New York.
- Of course he can.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.996
I mean...
what about the shelter?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.998
We'll figure something out.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.167
Dan has bigger aspirations
than running a dog shelter.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.236
So do I.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.016
I was supposed to go back
to cosmetology school.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.239
That was our agreement.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.574
Well, our agreement

17:23.609 --> 17:25.209
was that if I got
the network job

17:25.244 --> 17:26.377
and moved to New York,

17:26.413 --> 17:27.478
we'd get married.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.413
How romantic.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.648
Hey, look, we can
talk about this tomorrow.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.884
You can't leave.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.252
Hey...

17:34.287 --> 17:36.387
it's going to be
all right, okay?

17:38.258 --> 17:41.392
So, what's for dinner?
I'm starved.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.295
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

17:51.237 --> 17:52.270
He cannot leave.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.872
- He's going to marry her?
- This cannot happen.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.108
She is so wrong for him.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.544
He's going to be stuck with her
for the rest of his life.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.012
You have to change his mind.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.613
Come on, Michelle!

18:02.649 --> 18:04.849
You can't just change someone's
mind about these things.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.085
Do you want him to marry her?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.287
Not exactly.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.366
Do you want this shelter
to be shut down?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.355
No, of course not.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.858
- Do you trust me?
- Of course not.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.595
We have 30 days
to turn this disaster around.

18:17.630 --> 18:22.066
- And the meddling begins.
- No... the countdown begins.

18:23.903 --> 18:24.936
It's on.

18:34.161 --> 18:37.315
Well, your duck will be swimming
again, in no time, Mrs. Dunlap.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.183
Thank you.
You're very sweet.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.086
Well, that's because
she takes after me.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.322
Your granddaughter
has a nice disposition.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.289
I don't know where
she got that from.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.592
Very funny.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.094
Nonetheless, you're going to be
in good hands when I retire.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.131
You're never going to retire, Isaac.
You know that.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.267
- You both take care, now.
- You too.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.302
Come on...

18:58.338 --> 19:01.105
She's right, you know...
this was your calling.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.843
I know that look.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.945
What is it?

19:07.981 --> 19:08.880
I'm fine.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.551
I heard that Dan was leaving.
Getting married, is he?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.952
Word travels fast, huh?

19:14.988 --> 19:15.853
I don't think Dan and New York

19:15.889 --> 19:18.523
are a very good match,
though, do you?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.291
It's not really my business.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.729
Well, I mean, I'm worried
about the shelter.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.774
You know,
he does great work there,

19:25.798 --> 19:28.032
and there's a lot of dogs
that wouldn't have homes

19:28.067 --> 19:30.301
if it wasn't for him.

19:30.336 --> 19:34.438
I hope he realizes that.
Hate to see him make a mistake.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.580
What is it?

19:42.615 --> 19:43.826
Michelle wants me to come in.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.728
One of the dogs is having an
emergency, so I'll see you later.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.051
You want me to go?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.319
No, it's okay.
I got it.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.654
Okay.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.947
I've already been looking
at places on the Upper East Side.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.998
The whole wedding thing
is another issue.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.111
It's going to be everything
I can do

20:02.135 --> 20:03.868
to keep my mother
from taking over.

20:03.903 --> 20:07.672
- You know how she is.
- I know.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.442
Doesn't matter.
We will decide what we want.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.945
I just cannot believe
this is really happening,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.980
that we're actually going
to be living in New York!

20:17.383 --> 20:19.584
What am I going
to be doing there?

20:19.619 --> 20:21.519
We'll find something for you,
sweetie.

20:21.554 --> 20:25.089
Look, a whole new world of
opportunities is going to open up...

20:25.124 --> 20:26.124
for both of us.

20:26.159 --> 20:30.228
It's a big change, Kristi,
and Michelle, she's not happy.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.863
It's putting her
under a lot of pressure, too.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.333
Well, Michelle
doesn't control your life.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.337
What?

20:39.472 --> 20:40.404
It's nothing.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.708
Look, I want you to be excited
about this.

20:43.743 --> 20:47.612
I am excited, but I've got
a lot of responsibilities here.

20:47.647 --> 20:52.049
And you'll get it all figured out
like you always do.

20:52.085 --> 20:56.087
You have always been
so supportive,

20:56.122 --> 20:57.255
and I want you with me.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.125
We're a team.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.728
I love you.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.467
What now?

21:10.503 --> 21:12.436
It's Michelle.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.605
Something's wrong
with one of the dogs.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.740
Well, can't she handle it?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.087
I mean, she might as well get
used to handling things, right?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.978
- It's Beasley.
- That nasty thing?

21:21.014 --> 21:24.315
She's not nasty, and I'm
the only one that she trusts.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.785
It's just a dog.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.791
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:45.505 --> 21:46.904
Poor thing.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.109
- What's wrong with her?
- It was the darndest thing.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.511
I heard whimpering,

21:53.546 --> 21:55.658
and then I went to check in on her,
and she wasn't breathing.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.149
Then... like a miracle!

21:58.184 --> 22:01.652
Just popped right back to normal
before Carly got here.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.988
- A miracle, huh?
- Yeah, she seems fine to me.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.490
I would check her,
just to be sure.

22:06.526 --> 22:09.393
Take your time. I know how much
Beasley means to you.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.395
Sorry, hope I didn't panic you.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.230
Yeah.
She wasn't breathing, right?

22:13.266 --> 22:16.000
Like I said,
it was the darndest thing.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.335
Yeah, you said that.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.570
What were you doing here
at this hour anyway?

22:19.605 --> 22:22.807
Well, I have to take over the shelter,
so I have a lot of work to do.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.208
Right, right.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.710
I'm going to let you two...

22:26.946 --> 22:28.479
and...

22:28.514 --> 22:30.214
toodles!

22:34.620 --> 22:38.322
Well, it's a good thing
she was here, huh?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.825
- Yeah, a miracle.
- Yeah.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.027
- Speaking of which...
- What?

22:43.062 --> 22:45.663
You seem to be the only other person
Beasley's comfortable with.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.898
Oh, really?
What's her history?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.381
We don't know.
I found her in a ditch.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.205
I guess that's why
she trusts me so much.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.945
- Yep, she definitely likes you.
- Yeah?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.213
Yeah.
Wait...

23:03.750 --> 23:06.395
She's wondering
if she can take you for a walk.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.954
- Wait, take me for a walk?
- Yeah.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.089
Well, yes, of course.
I would love that.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.292
- Would you like to join us?
- I'll have to ask.

23:15.828 --> 23:16.927
Is that okay, Beasley?

23:18.464 --> 23:20.131
I think that's a yes.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.766
- Definitely a yes.
- Yeah.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.269
- Okay.
- Come on, you.

23:37.150 --> 23:42.553
So, Dan the Dog Man,
Mr. Expert Matchmaker...

23:42.588 --> 23:46.791
Come on, Beasley's clearly chosen
who she wants to be with.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.626
Why haven't you adopted her?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.628
It's complicated.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.830
You do know "It's complicated"
is a euphemism

23:52.865 --> 23:55.900
for "It shouldn't have to be
this complicated," right?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.468
Hey, are you hungry?
These are so good.

23:57.503 --> 23:58.669
Always hungry.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.864
Can we get two strawberry
and chocolate crepes, please?

24:03.876 --> 24:04.996
Want some crepes, Beas, huh?

24:06.612 --> 24:09.346
Yup, you definitely are the
only other person besides me

24:09.382 --> 24:10.648
that she's comfortable with.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.584
Well, not at first, but now
we get along, don't we, Beas?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.420
I think it's 'cause
you love dogs so much.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.123
Yeah, well,
you and I have that in common.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.658
Yeah, Kristi and I don't.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.529
Thank you.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.364
Yeah, but, I mean...
why is that?

24:27.400 --> 24:30.167
Does she have some kind
of crazy allergy or what?

24:30.203 --> 24:32.269
No, she just doesn't like dogs.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.855
Wait, I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to comprehend.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.047
She doesn't like dogs?
At all?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.960
Apparently, when she was
a little girl, she got bit,

24:44.984 --> 24:48.118
but... you know,
I just think that's an excuse.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.854
You know what
I wonder sometimes?

24:49.889 --> 24:50.933
Whether she just doesn't like

24:50.957 --> 24:53.057
that I give more attention
to the dogs than her.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.291
What?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.560
She's jealous
of the rescue animals?

24:56.596 --> 24:59.029
It's just a theory.

25:01.434 --> 25:02.800
I mean, are you okay with that?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.668
I mean, never being able
to have a dog?

25:04.704 --> 25:07.171
It's a relationship, right?
It's about compromise.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.219
No... compromise is about
meeting in the middle.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.910
I'm seeing
about 90-10 here, Dan.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.646
Sorry, she's your fiancée.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.582
Do I detect a little bit
of sarcasm, Carly Monroe?

25:18.618 --> 25:21.752
I wasn't going for a little.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.689
I was right.
You haven't changed a bit.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.699
Well... how else are you
going to know that I...

25:29.896 --> 25:30.961
that I'm sincere?

25:34.400 --> 25:36.066
So...

25:36.102 --> 25:38.068
how'd you end up
with Kristi Waters?

25:38.104 --> 25:40.382
I mean, the world's biggest dog lover,
and the world's biggest dog hater?

25:40.406 --> 25:42.740
Well, yeah...

25:42.775 --> 25:45.387
she didn't exactly spell it out
when we first started dating.

25:45.411 --> 25:49.079
- So she lied to you.
- No, she didn't exactly lie to me.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.848
Come on!
It's a classic bait and switch.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.350
Sorry.
Can't help it.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.619
Hey...

25:55.655 --> 25:57.421
don't be sorry, all right?

25:57.456 --> 25:59.376
I really appreciate
that you're honest with me...

26:00.993 --> 26:02.538
but if you really want
to know the truth,

26:02.562 --> 26:05.462
the "Friday Friends" thing,
that was all Kristi's idea.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.464
She made it happen,

26:07.500 --> 26:09.133
I was allowed to do what I love.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.535
It saved the shelter,
and a lot of animals,

26:11.571 --> 26:12.814
so, you know,
I owe her for that.

26:12.838 --> 26:16.707
Don't you mean
you love her for that?

26:16.742 --> 26:21.345
Come on, Dan, we owe bankers
and lawyers, not fiancées.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.548
You just don't know her
the way that I know her.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.383
No...

26:26.419 --> 26:28.552
but I do know you.

26:28.588 --> 26:30.688
Come on, I'm just looking out
for you, kid.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.091
Thanks, kid.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.228
You know, I might take Beasley
home with me tonight.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.474
It really helps
to keep her calm,

26:39.498 --> 26:40.965
and I just live
around the corner.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.946
Yeah... well, I've got
to go back to the shelter

26:43.970 --> 26:47.104
and grab a few things,
but I'll close up for you.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.807
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:51.677 --> 26:52.977
Beasley, come on.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.513
Hey...

26:56.549 --> 26:58.949
- Thank Beasley for the walk.
- I will.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.784
'Kay.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.320
- Hey, Carly?
- Yeah?

27:03.356 --> 27:05.289
Thank you for the walk.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.157
You're welcome.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.728
Come on.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.740
- Hello. Hey there.
- I know what we need to do.

27:24.677 --> 27:27.111
- Should I be nervous?
- Well...

27:27.146 --> 27:28.912
What's your next brilliant plan?

27:28.948 --> 27:31.181
- You.
- Me?

27:31.217 --> 27:33.183
It's pretty obvious,

27:33.219 --> 27:35.419
the way Dan looked at you
last night.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.287
He lit up like a firefly,

27:37.323 --> 27:40.791
not to mention
you absolutely glow around him.

27:40.826 --> 27:41.725
I don't glow.

27:41.761 --> 27:44.261
The point is,
he's crushing on you, too.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.296
Please.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.599
- He just doesn't know it yet.
- No, come on!

27:48.634 --> 27:51.502
That ship has sailed with the
wind at Kristi's back, all right?

27:51.537 --> 27:54.338
Dan's never going to see me
the way that he sees Kristi,

27:54.373 --> 27:56.106
and I mean that literally.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.610
- So you agree.
- Agree to what?

27:59.645 --> 28:02.346
- You need a tune-up.
- What am I, a car?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.348
A makeover.
You know how men are.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.883
They're... visual.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.985
You just have to bait
the hook a little.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.787
Bait the hook?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.789
If you want him back,
you have to wow him.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.624
You're insane.

28:13.659 --> 28:15.392
Insanity
is the mother of invention.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.461
Necessity
is the mother of invention.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.463
Exactly!

28:19.498 --> 28:21.398
Listen, if Dan's not going
to be with Kristi,

28:21.434 --> 28:23.211
then he needs to figure that out
on his own, okay?

28:23.235 --> 28:25.335
Not because
of your... plotting.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.539
- Well, some things take plotting.
- No, no, no.

28:28.574 --> 28:31.041
I am not going to be the bait
to your scheming hook.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.911
- Then he's going be gone.
- Well, then he was meant to go.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.012
No, this is not the time

28:35.047 --> 28:37.815
for your "It's the way
of the universe" reasoning.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.361
You know, desperate times
call for desperate...

28:39.385 --> 28:41.852
Three words for you.
No. Way. Ah-ha.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.087
That's four words.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.888
Anyways, you have
to trust me on this.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.124
I don't trust you on anything.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.671
Listen, I have a ton of patients
in the morning,

28:49.695 --> 28:51.006
so I'm going to need you to go,
all right?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.030
I just got here.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.432
I think you need to go find
somewhere else to meddle.

28:55.468 --> 28:56.366
I don't meddle.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.235
I don't think you know
what that word means.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.170
I've never meddled before.

29:17.723 --> 29:18.756
I'm really sorry

29:18.791 --> 29:20.691
I haven't been able
to make a decision yet, Dan.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.370
Well, you don't choose
the dog, Mrs. Gilbert...

29:22.394 --> 29:23.961
The dog chooses me.
I know that...

29:23.996 --> 29:25.863
but it still has to be mutual,

29:25.898 --> 29:30.267
and I just haven't
felt that connection.

29:30.302 --> 29:34.071
So, are you getting tired of
setting up all of my interviews?

29:34.106 --> 29:37.641
Hey...
Not at all, okay?

29:37.676 --> 29:40.811
When you know, you'll know,
and so will he or she.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.980
It's...

29:43.015 --> 29:45.382
it's a lot like falling in love.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.417
You can't control it.
It controls you.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.953
Are you an expert
at falling in love?

29:49.989 --> 29:52.389
Far from it.
Well, is anyone?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.324
Actually, yes, my husband was,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.093
and I was very lucky
in that way.

29:58.664 --> 29:59.664
I miss him,

29:59.698 --> 30:02.933
and I guess that's why
I'm looking for a friend.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.001
Well...

30:04.036 --> 30:07.070
then let's make sure we find you
the right match, shall we?

30:07.106 --> 30:08.972
Yeah.

31:12.371 --> 31:14.705
Michelle?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.740
The countdown is on.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.012
You won't regret this.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.981
That is the beginning
of every regret, you know.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.016
Pish posh.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.150
Hi, Dr. Monroe.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.319
Hey, Michelle.
What are you two up to?

31:29.355 --> 31:32.256
Saving the world
one makeover at a time.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.024
I'll see you
at the shelter later.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.995
- I'm going to get a dog.
- Great!

31:40.766 --> 31:43.100
Okay, just so you know,
I still think this is crazy.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.701
I'm only doing this for you.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.769
I know, I know.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.204
We just have
to change something.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.706
- Some... things.
- Things...

31:49.742 --> 31:51.575
Everything...
the glasses, the hair...

31:51.610 --> 31:52.576
you wear no make-up...

31:52.611 --> 31:53.577
Please, be honest.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.711
You said it yourself.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.381
Dan still considers you
his high-school sweetheart.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.050
I mean, this is Kristi Waters
we're dealing with,

32:00.085 --> 32:01.930
so if you want him
to see you as something else,

32:01.954 --> 32:04.254
you have
to become something else.

32:05.991 --> 32:06.857
What?

32:06.892 --> 32:08.425
When's the last time
you went shopping,

32:08.460 --> 32:09.726
senior year of high school?

32:09.762 --> 32:10.727
Come on, Michelle.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.483
You know I don't care
about stuff like that.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.299
Well, it's not like...
come on, I like my clothes!

32:15.334 --> 32:16.574
Well, I got my license in that.

32:16.602 --> 32:17.668
No.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.883
No, I got my braces off in that!
It was a really big day.

32:21.907 --> 32:22.973
It's cute.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.142
No, no!

32:25.177 --> 32:26.588
Look, I can't afford
a whole new wardrobe, okay?

32:26.612 --> 32:30.614
- I have student loans to pay off.
- And I have a credit card.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.556
Volume.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.326
No.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.330
Let go of the hair.
Let it down.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.231
We don't need that anymore.
Yes!

32:48.300 --> 32:49.300
Yes, bigger!

33:05.985 --> 33:07.985
I am loving it!

33:10.556 --> 33:12.456
Too much?

33:12.491 --> 33:15.025
Maybe a little.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.660
- What about the glasses?
- What? No!

33:16.695 --> 33:18.762
Michelle, I can't see
without those!

33:18.797 --> 33:20.764
Well, what's important
is that Dan sees.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.000
We want him to see everything.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.336
- Can you handle it?
- I can try.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.644
You have a small
male dog to deliver.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.645
Hey, Dan.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.981
Dr. Monroe!
Right on time.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.083
You said you had
someone in mind.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.552
Yes, sir,
a new friend that just moved in.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.698
I was telling him about you.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.022
He'd like to meet.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.524
- Let's do it.
- All right.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.559
Just back here.

33:50.662 --> 33:54.231
So, Prince here is interested in
a new companion,

33:54.266 --> 33:56.299
and he'd like to take you
for a walk, Dr. Monroe.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.968
Glad to hear it.

33:58.003 --> 34:01.405
- Thanks, Megan.
- You're welcome.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.507
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

34:03.542 --> 34:05.208
All right, so just be yourself.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.511
Don't try to impress.
Dogs see truth.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.579
I've been a vet
for over 50 years, Dan.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.848
I think I taught you that.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.382
That's right, you did.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.818
Wait, whoa.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.431
I already had an appointment
with Prince.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.554
Well, he's already requested
a walk with me.

34:18.590 --> 34:19.590
You told me noon.

34:20.692 --> 34:25.027
I'm afraid I did, Mrs. Gilbert.
I am so sorry for the mix-up.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.596
There're other dogs.

34:26.632 --> 34:29.565
Do you have any idea
how long it has taken me

34:29.601 --> 34:31.001
to find a dog that I could act...

34:31.036 --> 34:32.369
Wait!

34:32.404 --> 34:34.036
Prince might have a solution.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.172
He'd like to take both of you
for a walk...

34:36.208 --> 34:38.208
if that's okay?

34:40.813 --> 34:42.679
Well, I...
I can live with that.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.248
I suppose.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.518
There's a nice little trail
right around the corner.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.353
Well, I think
Prince would like that.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.922
He does.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.972
- I'll take him first.
- Really?

35:09.908 --> 35:10.774
All right, I suggest

35:10.809 --> 35:12.642
you two both be
on your best behavior.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.077
Prince here is very particular

35:14.113 --> 35:15.657
and frowns on anything
but happy thoughts.

35:15.681 --> 35:16.681
Understood?

35:17.549 --> 35:18.715
Understood.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.152
Thank you.

35:22.187 --> 35:25.288
Take some time, you know.
Get to know each other.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.737
Carly?

35:45.144 --> 35:46.409
That's Carly, all right.

35:46.445 --> 35:49.312
- That can't be Carly.
- I think it is.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.288
Indeed, it is.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.557
Those heels
are taller than I am.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.726
- Hey!
- Hey!

36:02.761 --> 36:05.262
- What's with the get-up?
- Get-up?

36:05.297 --> 36:06.930
Nah, it's just...
me being me.

36:08.934 --> 36:09.900
It's okay.

36:09.935 --> 36:13.069
I...
I'm going to head inside

36:13.105 --> 36:16.606
and take care of the
animals that I love.

36:17.743 --> 36:18.743
What's going on?

36:19.945 --> 36:21.411
She looks amazing, right?

36:24.783 --> 36:27.284
- You're doing so good.
- Really?

36:27.319 --> 36:28.251
Just... Yeah,
you look great.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.486
Fantastic.
Just...

36:29.521 --> 36:30.987
He's coming.
Act natural.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.259
It's just straight ahead.

36:37.796 --> 36:40.764
Yeah! I'm fine.
Honestly.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.266
- Where are your glasses?
- In my purse.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.768
Why?

36:44.803 --> 36:48.104
Because I got contacts,
and they just...

36:48.140 --> 36:49.751
they're not going to arrive
for a few more days, so...

36:49.775 --> 36:53.343
Well, shouldn't you just wear
your glasses in the meantime?

36:53.378 --> 36:54.344
No!

36:54.379 --> 36:56.313
No, 'cause they're
a different prescription,

36:56.348 --> 36:58.748
and it's a stronger one, and...

36:58.784 --> 37:01.751
well, and my glasses are in
my purse, which is in my car,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.420
so...

37:05.324 --> 37:07.657
Why did she get all dressed up?

37:07.693 --> 37:10.138
If I have to answer that...
You really don't get it, do you?

37:10.162 --> 37:11.528
Get what?

37:11.563 --> 37:12.629
It.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.930
"It"?

37:13.966 --> 37:16.499
To be young again.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.270
Not me.
I like being old...

37:20.305 --> 37:22.372
except for my knee.
I had to give up my golf.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.275
I'm past all that nonsense,
you know...

37:25.310 --> 37:28.178
courtship,
trying to impress someone...

37:28.213 --> 37:29.446
Well, good.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.847
Yeah.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.187
Okay...

37:41.093 --> 37:42.125
Okay...

37:42.160 --> 37:44.361
So...

37:44.396 --> 37:47.063
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

37:47.099 --> 37:48.431
Yeah.
Never been better.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.635
So, who is our patient here, huh?

37:51.670 --> 37:52.670
Beasley.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.839
Hey!

37:55.874 --> 37:58.908
Hey, you recognize me?
It's Carly!

37:58.944 --> 38:00.021
Maybe if you pulled
your hair back,

38:00.045 --> 38:00.877
she could see your face better.

38:00.912 --> 38:04.581
Right...
my hair ties are in my purse.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.716
And your purse is in your car.

38:06.752 --> 38:07.752
Right...

38:07.786 --> 38:08.818
Here.

38:08.854 --> 38:09.819
Okay...

38:09.855 --> 38:10.887
Rubber band.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.156
- I can...
- I'll...

38:13.191 --> 38:15.058
Okay.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.593
All right.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.036
Thanks.

38:26.071 --> 38:29.339
You look...
nice.

38:29.374 --> 38:32.375
I haven't seen you
this dressed up since, prom?

38:34.579 --> 38:35.679
I just...

38:35.714 --> 38:39.449
you know, I thought I'd...
switch things up a little.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.786
So...
let's see here.

38:45.891 --> 38:46.956
Okay...

38:46.992 --> 38:50.460
let's see your pretty smile.

38:50.495 --> 38:54.564
Here we go.
That's a happy dog.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.367
Hey. Hey...

38:57.402 --> 38:58.968
I got this.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.103
Yeah.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.738
That's good.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.478
You know, I used to
bring my Charlie to you.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.580
You know, I thought
you looked familiar.

39:10.615 --> 39:12.583
- Shepherd, right?
- Yeah.

39:12.617 --> 39:15.752
- Beautiful animal.
- Yeah.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.789
I met your wife once, and...
what was her name?

39:18.824 --> 39:20.890
Claire.
I'm a widower now.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.492
I'm sorry.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.227
It's all right.
It's been a while...

39:24.262 --> 39:25.562
and your husband?

39:25.597 --> 39:27.408
He used to bring Charlie in
to see me sometimes.

39:27.432 --> 39:31.101
Yeah, he's passed away as well.
It's been a few years.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.569
Listen...

39:32.604 --> 39:34.015
I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot today.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.173
It's just that this
is the first dog

39:37.209 --> 39:38.742
I've actually felt
a connection with.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.080
I think it's your turn
to take the reins.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.570
Well, let's both
get to know him a little better,

39:51.490 --> 39:53.123
Come on, Prince.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.924
Come on, buddy.

40:07.339 --> 40:09.305
What was that?

40:09.341 --> 40:12.108
Totally my bad.
I talked her into it...

40:12.144 --> 40:14.645
- just change things up a little.
- Why?

40:16.381 --> 40:19.015
You know, I love you,
but you really are clueless.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.732
Way to go, Carly Monroe.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.734
You just ruined
any chance you had.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.422
- Dr. Monroe.
- Hey, hello, Dan.

41:32.457 --> 41:33.890
Here to give Prince
a walk again?

41:33.925 --> 41:36.926
- Yeah, if that's okay.
- Yeah, of course.

41:36.962 --> 41:40.463
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.565
- Who would I be expecting?
- No one.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.267
Prince is in the back here.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.102
Have you...
have you talked to Carly

41:46.137 --> 41:47.904
since the whole...
you know...?

41:47.939 --> 41:49.439
No, no.

41:49.474 --> 41:50.373
I tried calling her,
but she hasn't called me back.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.674
Why?

41:51.710 --> 41:54.410
Well, if I have to answer that,
then you don't get it, do you?

41:54.479 --> 41:56.713
- Get what?
- It.

41:56.748 --> 41:59.148
- "It"?
- That's what I said.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.986
Look, I think
Carly's trying to impress you.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.221
Impress me?

42:05.257 --> 42:06.556
Why?

42:06.591 --> 42:10.260
You're asking the wrong person.
You might want to go see her.

42:11.463 --> 42:12.428
All right.

42:12.464 --> 42:14.998
Come on, Prince.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.967
I forgot.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.836
Mrs. Gilbert
is walking Prince today.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.238
Would it be all right
if you shared him again?

42:22.274 --> 42:26.509
- Yeah, sure. It's okay.
- Seems only fair.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.311
Two days in a row, you two.

42:28.346 --> 42:31.948
Well, Prince's can't seem
to quite make up his mind.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.516
Yeah, he's a little torn.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.312
And we don't want
to put any pressure on him.

42:36.354 --> 42:37.354
There's no rush.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.757
That's very thoughtful.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.659
Shall we?

42:42.694 --> 42:44.260
Dr. Monroe.

42:50.402 --> 42:53.303
And you did not forget
I was coming in.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.815
I have no idea what you're
talking about, Mrs. Gilbert.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.906
Yes, you do.

43:07.052 --> 43:10.587
- Is she going to be okay?
- Well, I think so.

43:10.622 --> 43:12.288
Let me ask you something, Emma.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.324
Does Sprinkles here
have a sweet tooth?

43:14.359 --> 43:16.527
- She does like chocolate.
- I bet she does,

43:16.561 --> 43:19.295
but I don't think
chocolate likes her very much.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.971
How much chocolate
did you give her exactly?

43:28.006 --> 43:29.405
Just a little.

43:30.508 --> 43:31.808
At first.

43:31.843 --> 43:34.611
You've got to think of Sprinkles
kind of like your little sister.

43:34.646 --> 43:37.213
I mean, she can only eat
what she's supposed to, okay?

43:37.248 --> 43:38.014
You wouldn't stuff
your little sister

43:38.049 --> 43:39.349
full of chocolate now,
would you?

43:39.384 --> 43:42.118
Maybe...

43:42.153 --> 43:43.286
Well, next time,

43:43.321 --> 43:44.699
how about you just share
your chocolate with me instead?

43:44.723 --> 43:47.857
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:47.892 --> 43:49.125
She's good to go.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.128
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.808
Let me know if she breaks
into another stash.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.498
Will do.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.500
Goodbye!
Thanks, Dr. Carly!

43:57.535 --> 43:59.502
Bye, Emma.

43:59.537 --> 44:02.038
- Hi.
- Hey.

44:02.073 --> 44:04.540
Why, I hardly recognize you
with your contacts in.

44:04.576 --> 44:06.442
Very funny.

44:06.478 --> 44:08.111
Peace offering.

44:08.146 --> 44:08.945
Come on, I'm the one

44:08.980 --> 44:11.381
who should be offering
peace terms.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.483
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be embarrassed.

44:13.518 --> 44:15.598
We've all worn the wrong heels
on the wrong occasion.

44:17.555 --> 44:18.955
Bag lunch, just like old times?

44:18.990 --> 44:21.024
I don't know.
Is it peanut butter and jelly?

44:21.059 --> 44:22.191
Of course.

44:22.227 --> 44:25.863
- Okay, I accept your terms.
- Excellent.

44:29.100 --> 44:33.036
Man, I don't think I've had
a PB-and-J since high school.

44:33.071 --> 44:34.971
Last time for me
was right here...

44:35.006 --> 44:36.439
with you.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.712
Yes!

44:42.747 --> 44:44.347
Nicely done.

44:44.382 --> 44:45.915
Hey, Monroe!

44:45.950 --> 44:48.084
Five bucks says
you can't hit that shot.

44:48.119 --> 44:49.196
What? Come on!
It's right there.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.586
I'm not that unathletic!

44:50.622 --> 44:53.356
- Okay...
- Make it ten.

44:53.391 --> 44:56.492
- You're on.
- Okay.

44:56.528 --> 44:57.927
I'm about to make ten dollars.

44:57.962 --> 45:00.496
No pressure.

45:02.934 --> 45:05.902
- I scored!
- Lucky shot.

45:05.937 --> 45:08.104
- Come on. Pay up.
- I forgot my wallet.

45:08.139 --> 45:09.939
You are such a liar.
Don't be a squelch.

45:13.311 --> 45:16.046
Hello, Mr. Hamilton.
Nice to meet you.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.882
Let's go, Lucky Shot.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.563
So, did I make
a total fool of myself,

45:33.598 --> 45:35.631
or just... sort of?

45:35.667 --> 45:37.800
No, no, it was...
it was total.

45:37.836 --> 45:39.902
Come on!

45:39.938 --> 45:43.406
But I know why you did it...
I think...

45:43.441 --> 45:45.808
and I know that my sister
put you up to it...

45:45.844 --> 45:48.878
playing matchmaker
so maybe I wouldn't move?

45:48.913 --> 45:51.080
She didn't exactly
have to twist my arm.

45:52.817 --> 45:56.119
- Why exactly did you do it?
- It doesn't really matter.

45:56.154 --> 45:57.465
I just hate seeing you forced
into a decision

45:57.489 --> 45:59.088
you don't want to make.

45:59.124 --> 46:01.324
And that's it?

46:01.359 --> 46:03.226
That's your only motive?

46:04.295 --> 46:06.229
I guess...

46:06.264 --> 46:09.065
I thought maybe, for a minute,

46:09.100 --> 46:11.768
that if I was
as pretty as Kristi,

46:11.803 --> 46:13.636
then maybe you'd have
second thoughts.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.441
It was stupid.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.109
Yeah, it was.

46:20.145 --> 46:22.078
Come on, you don't have
to be that honest.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.158
No, I mean, that you think
that that's all I care about,

46:24.182 --> 46:28.017
is how Kristi looks,
her job, her fame...

46:28.052 --> 46:30.953
and I'll let you in
on a little secret.

46:30.989 --> 46:33.456
You don't need all those things
to be prettier than Kristi.

46:33.491 --> 46:36.425
Is this the part
where you pass me a note,

46:36.461 --> 46:37.872
and you ask me
to be your girlfriend,

46:37.896 --> 46:40.163
and tell me to circle yes or no?

46:40.198 --> 46:41.164
Hey, I'm being serious.

46:41.199 --> 46:43.167
- Well then, don't tease me.
- I'm not.

46:45.703 --> 46:48.104
Carly, you are beautiful...

46:48.139 --> 46:49.405
inside and out.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.609
Glasses or no glasses.

46:56.514 --> 46:59.115
The truth is, seeing you again,

46:59.150 --> 47:01.584
it just brought me
right back to us.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.192
Listen, I just, I got
caught up in the moment,

47:09.227 --> 47:12.228
and it was silly,
and I'm over it.

47:12.263 --> 47:15.498
- Over it?
- Over it.

47:15.533 --> 47:18.734
Man, it really makes me wish
I never went away to college.

47:18.770 --> 47:19.702
Come on.
Don't do that.

47:19.737 --> 47:22.872
Don't make regrets
out of the choices you made.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.488
What, you don't think it was
a mistake that we both left?

47:27.512 --> 47:29.679
No...

47:29.714 --> 47:32.548
because if it was a mistake,

47:32.584 --> 47:36.652
then it invalidates
every choice we've ever made.

47:36.688 --> 47:38.187
I mean...

47:38.223 --> 47:39.488
did I think about you?

47:41.092 --> 47:42.992
Yes.

47:43.027 --> 47:45.828
Did I sometimes wonder
what might have been?

47:47.131 --> 47:48.531
Yes...

47:50.602 --> 47:53.369
but you're Dan the Dog Man.

47:53.404 --> 47:57.573
Your path took you here, and...

47:57.609 --> 48:00.543
the world's a better place
because of it...

48:00.578 --> 48:03.624
and I followed my dreams,
and now I'm a veterinarian,

48:03.648 --> 48:05.882
and the world's a better place
because of that, too.

48:10.722 --> 48:13.122
Everything happens
the way it's supposed to,

48:13.157 --> 48:15.224
so no regrets.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.197
- You still believe in all that?
- Yep.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.232
All of it.

48:22.267 --> 48:24.867
But you think I'm making
a mistake now, don't you?

48:24.903 --> 48:28.204
No, you're making a choice, Dan.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.872
It's only a mistake
if it's not your own.

48:34.946 --> 48:36.779
Hey, Michelle.

48:36.814 --> 48:40.483
- Yeah, hang on.
- Shoot, what time is it?

48:40.518 --> 48:42.385
Yeah, no, be right there!

48:42.420 --> 48:43.420
Come on!

48:48.993 --> 48:49.993
Do you have the time?

48:54.499 --> 48:57.433
- I've been calling and calling!
- Sorry, my phone died.

48:57.468 --> 48:59.602
- Where were you?
- Having lunch.

48:59.637 --> 49:02.838
- With her? It's 4:00, Dan.
- I know. I lost track of time.

49:02.874 --> 49:03.839
Listen, it was my fault.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.975
I was enjoying his company.

49:06.010 --> 49:07.510
I'm sure you were,

49:07.545 --> 49:09.845
but while you two
were out gallivanting,

49:09.881 --> 49:11.161
no one here can make a decision!

49:12.650 --> 49:14.410
They don't know
what dog you want to feature.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.197
We just didn't know which dog
was ready to be matched yet.

49:17.221 --> 49:19.088
We have no dog for the segment,

49:19.123 --> 49:21.157
and we go on air
in three minutes!

49:21.192 --> 49:24.360
- Speckles!
- Okay, Speckles.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.328
No, Sushi!
Get Sushi.

49:25.363 --> 49:28.397
- I'll get him.
- Go! Go!

49:30.335 --> 49:32.969
- Catching up on old times?
- Yeah.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.849
I don't like the way
she speaks to me...

49:35.873 --> 49:37.840
or looks at me.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.742
She probably feels the same way.

49:40.812 --> 49:41.812
So it's my fault?

49:41.846 --> 49:42.846
One minute.

49:43.982 --> 49:45.181
We need a dog now!

49:45.216 --> 49:46.315
Come on, Prince.

49:47.819 --> 49:49.819
There. That one.

49:49.854 --> 49:51.494
No, that one's
not up for adoption.

49:51.522 --> 49:54.056
Excuse me...

49:54.092 --> 49:55.169
We are going to need
to borrow this dog.

49:55.193 --> 49:57.860
- For what?
- "Friday's Friend" Segment.

49:57.895 --> 49:59.862
Sort of have
an emergency situation.

49:59.897 --> 50:01.030
Thirty seconds.

50:01.065 --> 50:03.232
No, no, no.
This is... this is ours.

50:03.267 --> 50:04.867
You're going to have
to find another dog.

50:05.536 --> 50:07.636
- You'll find another dog.
- No.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.305
We are about to go live!

50:09.340 --> 50:11.007
Prince already made
his decision.

50:11.042 --> 50:14.310
- Which one of us did he pick?
- Seriously!

50:14.345 --> 50:16.412
I think you both know
the answer to that.

50:16.447 --> 50:17.546
Dan!

50:17.582 --> 50:19.482
You are a very rude young lady.

50:19.517 --> 50:21.684
Excuse me?

50:21.719 --> 50:22.685
I got him!
I got him.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.588
Carly to the rescue.

50:25.623 --> 50:26.689
I hope so.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.726
All right,
and in three... two...

50:34.632 --> 50:35.498
For Channel 7 News,

50:35.533 --> 50:38.200
I'm Kristi Waters
with Dan the Dog Man,

50:38.236 --> 50:42.571
saying, "Make man's best friend
your best friend".

50:42.607 --> 50:44.707
And clear!

50:46.377 --> 50:49.578
- Great job.
- Beautifully done.

50:49.614 --> 50:53.582
Thank you, and my apologies.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.351
I just don't think
some of you realize

50:55.386 --> 50:58.521
the pressure of performing
on live TV.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.756
Can I get some water, please?

51:00.792 --> 51:03.726
So, how's the extended
interview process going, Prince?

51:06.497 --> 51:07.937
That's what my grandpa
tells me, too.

51:09.434 --> 51:12.401
- So, you must be Mrs. Gilbert.
- I am.

51:12.437 --> 51:15.037
- It's really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

51:15.073 --> 51:16.772
And thank you, Dan.

51:16.808 --> 51:17.940
It wouldn't be fair

51:17.975 --> 51:20.076
if someone else got their
hopes up for this one.

51:20.111 --> 51:23.612
Well, I know a good match
when I see one.

51:28.186 --> 51:29.952
Excuse me, everyone!

51:31.255 --> 51:32.266
I have an announcement
to make...

51:32.290 --> 51:36.425
a surprise for the man I love,
Dan the Dog Man.

51:36.461 --> 51:37.593
Here we go...

51:39.263 --> 51:42.798
I know I have been totally
wrapped up in my new job,

51:42.834 --> 51:44.633
and I'm sorry for that...

51:46.170 --> 51:49.405
but... yesterday,
I called the network

51:49.440 --> 51:52.141
and told them
I needed a big favor,

51:52.176 --> 51:57.847
and I am proud to announce
that you, Dan Landis,

51:57.882 --> 52:02.486
will be the New York Regional
Executive Director for...

52:04.222 --> 52:08.090
the National Dog Rescue
Association!

52:09.127 --> 52:11.527
- What?
- Yes!

52:11.562 --> 52:12.862
Right in the heart of New York.

52:12.897 --> 52:17.366
Everything you're doing here,
but on an entirely different level.

52:17.401 --> 52:20.569
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

52:29.747 --> 52:31.180
I don't know what to say.

52:31.215 --> 52:33.782
- How about thank you?
- Thank you!

52:35.820 --> 52:39.255
- I knew you'd be happy.
- Yeah! Yeah, definitely.

52:40.591 --> 52:42.658
I'm going to go
get out of this make-up.

52:42.693 --> 52:44.373
Looks like another celebration
is in order.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.061
Okay.

52:52.203 --> 52:54.670
I honestly can say
I didn't see that coming.

52:54.705 --> 52:57.473
Well, those are the best kind
of surprises, huh?

52:57.508 --> 52:58.508
Yeah.

52:58.543 --> 53:02.311
Congratulations.
You deserve it.

53:02.346 --> 53:05.047
- Thanks.
- Sure.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.521
Come on, Prince.

53:14.959 --> 53:16.959
Well, I guess that's that, then.

53:16.994 --> 53:19.595
I've got to give her credit.
Her timing is impeccable.

53:21.065 --> 53:22.905
I know I go on and on
about the shelter, but...

53:24.635 --> 53:27.303
he's my brother, and I kind
of like having him there.

53:27.338 --> 53:30.940
- I got used to it.
- So you're just giving up?

53:30.975 --> 53:33.309
Well, I mean, Dan
just got his dream job.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.311
Our little plan backfired.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.314
Wave the white flag.
I'm not.

53:37.348 --> 53:40.149
- I have an idea.
- Talk to me.

53:40.184 --> 53:41.717
The only problem is,

53:41.752 --> 53:43.385
do I still have
feelings for Dan,

53:43.421 --> 53:44.898
or is it simply
a transference of memories?

53:44.922 --> 53:47.556
Are you deep in thought again?

53:47.592 --> 53:48.357
You have to understand
something, Michelle.

53:48.392 --> 53:51.594
We don't remember past
relationships based on fact.

53:51.629 --> 53:54.063
We remember them
based on feelings, you know?

53:54.098 --> 53:57.066
We just grasp onto something
that can never be recreated,

53:57.101 --> 53:59.835
and by romanticizing
certain experiences,

53:59.870 --> 54:02.037
we simply make
our present fulfillment of life

54:02.073 --> 54:02.905
seem worse than it actually is!

54:02.940 --> 54:04.473
Come again?

54:04.508 --> 54:07.142
I also have to make sure
that I'm doing the right thing.

54:07.178 --> 54:08.143
All right, fine.

54:08.179 --> 54:09.856
We have less than a week.
What's your plan?

54:09.880 --> 54:12.381
Okay, so Dan's main
concern about leaving

54:12.416 --> 54:13.694
is the welfare
of the dogs, right?

54:13.718 --> 54:15.251
Right, seems to be the case.

54:15.286 --> 54:17.219
So what if we have
an adoption fair!

54:17.255 --> 54:19.488
I mean, forget
about adopting one dog.

54:19.523 --> 54:22.024
What if we find homes for all
of the them before Dan leaves?

54:22.059 --> 54:23.025
That's great for the dogs.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.860
But...

54:24.895 --> 54:26.695
what about you and Dan
and keeping him here?

54:26.731 --> 54:28.075
I mean, that's just going
to make him happy

54:28.099 --> 54:29.031
that he's leaving.

54:29.066 --> 54:30.766
Well, not necessarily.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.835
I mean, maybe
it'll make him realize

54:32.870 --> 54:34.770
what wonderful work
he's doing here,

54:34.805 --> 54:37.106
and, you know,
what he'd be walking away from,

54:37.141 --> 54:38.941
and besides,
it'll give us a chance

54:38.976 --> 54:40.120
to spend
some more time together.

54:40.144 --> 54:42.378
I could really need
some more time.

54:43.447 --> 54:46.416
To convince Dan...
or you?

54:47.485 --> 54:48.517
Both.

54:48.552 --> 54:49.752
I see.

54:51.422 --> 54:53.856
There we go.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.724
Just keep an eye on
him. He'll be okay.

55:07.738 --> 55:09.772
Come on, buddy.
Here we go.

55:12.176 --> 55:15.744
- You didn't steal him, did you?
- Yeah, I stole him.

55:17.748 --> 55:19.226
Actually, I thought maybe
you might like to take him

55:19.250 --> 55:20.783
for a walk on your own property,

55:20.818 --> 55:23.085
give him a chance to see
if he likes it here or not

55:23.120 --> 55:25.587
before he makes his decision.

55:25.623 --> 55:29.591
That's a good idea.
I'll be right with you.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.271
- You think Prince would like it here?
- I think he'd love it.

55:36.300 --> 55:38.233
You know, if I did adopt him,

55:38.269 --> 55:40.602
you could come
and visit him anytime.

55:42.306 --> 55:44.973
Well, I mean, we've got to do
what's right for the dog.

55:46.711 --> 55:49.345
You know, your flowers
are so beautiful.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.447
Did you plant
all these yourself?

55:51.482 --> 55:53.916
It's become somewhat of a hobby.

55:53.951 --> 55:56.485
Well, if you decide to retire,
you're going to need a hobby.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.321
Not if.
Carly's more than capable.

55:59.357 --> 56:01.023
My patients
will be in good hands.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.759
You know, she is so lovely,

56:03.794 --> 56:05.439
and it's just a shame
that Dan's moving away,

56:05.463 --> 56:07.429
because the two of them
are in love.

56:07.465 --> 56:09.142
They seem to be the only two
that don't know it.

56:09.166 --> 56:11.100
I think they do.

56:11.135 --> 56:12.601
They just don't know
how to say it.

56:12.636 --> 56:14.603
Well, I hope they figure it out.

56:16.073 --> 56:18.006
Shame if they don't.

56:26.183 --> 56:27.216
I think it's perfect.

56:27.251 --> 56:28.829
Do you think we can get it
organized in a week?

56:28.853 --> 56:31.019
- We can do it.
- Yeah, we can do it.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.020
We'll just, you know,

56:32.056 --> 56:33.856
pass out some flyers,
hang up some posters,

56:33.891 --> 56:35.891
and, you know,
we'll make it an event.

56:35.926 --> 56:38.994
- Where are we going to hold it?
- Well, it shouldn't be here.

56:39.029 --> 56:39.895
It should be some place

56:39.930 --> 56:43.399
people would normally
take their dogs, like...

56:43.434 --> 56:44.967
how about Long Lake Park?

56:45.002 --> 56:46.146
You know, we could
set up a walking area,

56:46.170 --> 56:48.871
do a meet and greet,
have some fun...

56:48.906 --> 56:49.671
we could do an interview room!

56:49.707 --> 56:51.140
I love it.

56:51.175 --> 56:54.042
- Great!
- Great!

56:56.013 --> 56:59.348
And I thought a banner
than says, "Countdown to Love",

56:59.383 --> 57:01.938
just to remind people that
dogs are more than just pets.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.690
Hey, Beas!
You doing okay, huh?

57:11.762 --> 57:12.828
Countdown to Love?

57:12.863 --> 57:14.763
Yeah, let's just call it
what it is.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.565
Okay, yeah.
Let's do it.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.108
Hey...

57:26.143 --> 57:27.254
I just really want you to know,

57:27.278 --> 57:29.344
I really appreciate
everything you're doing, and...

57:31.415 --> 57:33.917
Oh, shoot.
Sorry.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
Hey, what's up?

57:37.755 --> 57:39.555
Because if I'm going
to work for them,

57:39.590 --> 57:40.600
then I should at least
introduce myself.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.224
Hey, Beasley, come here.

57:43.994 --> 57:45.727
Okay, yeah.

57:45.763 --> 57:47.396
Sure.
See you soon.

57:49.266 --> 57:50.610
I'm going
to have to catch up with you.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.034
I've got to go help Kristi pack.

57:52.069 --> 57:55.037
Yeah, well, I've got to give
Beasley another checkup anyway.

57:55.072 --> 57:58.540
It is just so amazing
how she has taken to you.

57:58.576 --> 58:01.777
Yeah, she just needed
a little more time.

58:05.950 --> 58:07.127
Isn't it amazing
how much she loves dogs?

58:07.151 --> 58:10.018
I mean, she's a real dog person.

58:11.288 --> 58:13.021
What? I'm just saying.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.660
Great, we'll see you there.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.728
Hey!

58:19.763 --> 58:22.130
So I've got all
the shelter volunteers on board

58:22.166 --> 58:22.965
with helping with the event.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.334
Local media's
going to promote it,

58:25.369 --> 58:26.480
and they are eating up
the "Countdown to Love" idea.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.070
That's great.
What next?

58:28.105 --> 58:31.173
Banners, so I'm going to head
to the local print shop.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.007
And tomorrow, we have to work on

58:32.042 --> 58:33.420
getting all these critters
cleaned up,

58:33.444 --> 58:35.410
so can you get some supplies
for that?

58:35.446 --> 58:36.378
I'm already on it.

58:36.413 --> 58:38.814
Great, I'll...
I'll see you tomorrow.

58:39.950 --> 58:42.317
Forever Friends Rescue Shelter,
Michelle speaking.

58:57.635 --> 58:58.767
Carly!

58:58.802 --> 59:01.970
- Hi...
- Mrs. Gilbert.

59:02.006 --> 59:04.506
Rita came over
to, discuss Prince.

59:04.542 --> 59:06.174
Rita.

59:06.210 --> 59:08.810
We were talking. We were just...
talking about...

59:08.846 --> 59:11.280
- Discussing Prince.
- Clearly.

59:11.315 --> 59:12.614
Come sit down.

59:12.650 --> 59:13.994
Actually, we made
a decision about Prince.

59:14.018 --> 59:15.183
And who gets to adopt him.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.998
Dan seems to
think he likes both of us.

59:18.022 --> 59:19.388
Equally.

59:19.423 --> 59:21.023
I see.

59:21.058 --> 59:23.737
And after careful consideration,
we decided that we would...

59:23.761 --> 59:26.728
We'd both actually like to spend
a lot more time with him...

59:26.764 --> 59:27.807
actually,
as much time as possible.

59:27.831 --> 59:29.064
Okay.

59:29.099 --> 59:31.633
And the only logical way to do that
is if we both adopt him.

59:31.669 --> 59:33.969
Very logical.

59:34.004 --> 59:35.470
Yeah... which means

59:35.506 --> 59:36.816
we would be spending
a lot of time together.

59:36.840 --> 59:40.309
Well...
I think that's great.

59:40.344 --> 59:42.311
- You do?
- Really?

59:42.346 --> 59:43.378
Yeah.

59:43.414 --> 59:45.480
Of course I do.
I...

59:45.516 --> 59:47.482
you know,
you both deserve a... a friend.

59:47.518 --> 59:49.718
Well, it's mostly about Prince.

59:49.753 --> 59:54.089
Definitely,
and it's very... noble.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.357
Oh, by the way, you know,

59:55.392 --> 59:56.870
I saw a cute little apartment
for rent just down the street.

59:56.894 --> 01:00:00.362
Grandpa!
Okay, I'll look into it.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.499
Okay...

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:06.635
I...

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.404
you don't think this is moving
a little fast, do you?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.672
For Prince?

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.841
Well, at our age,
we have to move fast.

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:15.344
Well...

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.812
have a good night.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.489
So you know, I just...

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:29.625
I'm so close
with my grandfather,

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.694
and I just thought
that it made sense for me

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.374
to want to become
a veterinarian, you know?

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:35.464
Yeah?

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:36.698
This one's so cute.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:39.134
I know! She's been
so good today, too.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.145
So much hair, so little time.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.482
We've got to get them clean.
Nobody likes a smelly dog.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.752
- Do they?
- No.

01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:08.230
You know, I was thinking.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.900
About Beasley here...

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.802
and...

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.081
you know
that I'm a good matchmaker.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:17.305
Yeah, the best.
A legend.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.306
What do they call you
in these parts,

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.841
"The Canine Connector"?

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.643
Well, that's one of them.

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:23.145
Anyhow, I was thinking...

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:28.283
That I should adopt Beasley.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:32.499
Well, actually, that Beasley
should adopt you, but yeah.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.589
Right.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:37.492
You're the only other
person that she trusts,

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.027
and I'm not holding
onto a lot of hope

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:42.364
that that's going to change
after the adoption fair.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.465
I'm just really worried

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.445
about what's going
to happen to her after I leave.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.369
I mean, come on,
Beasley's great,

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:50.038
but she belongs with you.

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.074
Yeah...

01:01:51.108 --> 01:01:53.375
that's non-negotiable.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.476
It's pretty amazing to me

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.845
how you can be so good
at matching dogs to people,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.847
and even people to other people.

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:00.215
What do you mean?

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.090
My grandfather
hasn't been this happy in years.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.531
Very cleverly done, by the way.

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:07.589
- It was a lay-up.
- Yeah, but still, you did that.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:10.892
I mean, you do it every day,
but somehow,

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:13.930
you really have no talent for
matching yourself to others, do you?

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.100
You know...

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:20.635
every discussion we have

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.871
is about my choices
and my decisions.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:25.640
What about you?

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.053
Why can't you tell me
how you really feel?

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.376
Okay.

01:02:30.147 --> 01:02:31.147
Don't go to New York.

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:37.953
- That's... that's how I feel.
- No, that's what you think.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.790
Why don't you want me
to go to New York?

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.926
Come on...

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:45.827
Because...

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:47.095
Dan...

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:54.770
Her timing is impeccable.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040
So is yours.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:04.190
Figures you two
would be in a dog-friendly cafe.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:04.980
What, you're having

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:07.682
another stroll down memory lane?

01:03:07.718 --> 01:03:10.085
We were just discussing
my future in New York,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.920
and how much I'm going
to miss Beasley.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.123
Beasley?

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.159
Yeah. Beasley.

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:19.194
Well, thanks to me,

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.510
Beasley will more than likely
have a new home by tomorrow.

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.666
I spoke with my station manager.

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:26.134
They've agreed
to do live updates

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.236
from the adoption fair
throughout the day,

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:30.352
sort of an extension
of the "Friday Friends" segment.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:35.610
There won't be a single dog left
with that kind of exposure.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:36.890
And then there will be
nothing holding Dan back.

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:39.181
Exactly.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:40.715
You know, Kristi,

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:43.118
you have an uncanny ability
of doing other people favors

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.687
that somehow manage
to serve you more than anyone.

01:03:46.723 --> 01:03:47.889
Thank you.

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:48.857
Dan?

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:52.360
We're having dinner with
my parents, remember?

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.199
Are you coming with me?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.167
Are you?

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.321
Okay...

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:24.993
And then you just said
that to him, just like that?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.562
Then what happened?

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:30.265
He seemed really upset.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.033
Really?
And then what happened?

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:33.501
Nothing.

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.114
Queen Mean showed up
just in time to bail him out.

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:38.574
- We are so close.
- No, it's over...

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:42.210
I can't hear you!

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.279
I'm not doing...

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.883
Sorry, couldn't hear you.
It was so loud.

01:04:47.918 --> 01:04:49.784
What were you saying?
Go ahead.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:50.820
I'm not...

01:04:51.755 --> 01:04:54.122
- Come on.
- Okay, all right.

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:55.357
No sauce?

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.194
If only we had another few days.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.695
He almost didn't
get into her car.

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.864
Then tell him again.
Profess your love to him.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.468
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:07.914
Because you can't just
convince someone

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:09.437
to fall in love with you.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.706
You are so stubborn.

01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:14.576
You don't have to convince him.
He loves you.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:19.080
- You know he does.
- No. It's too late.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:22.284
- It's not too late.
- Look, he made his choice.

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:25.820
I saw that today, so...

01:05:25.856 --> 01:05:29.391
look, let's just do the adoption
fair tomorrow, and then...

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.526
we'll just get on
with our lives.

01:05:32.997 --> 01:05:35.430
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream always helps.

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:37.899
Yeah.

01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:39.434
I have so many flavors
right now...

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:41.770
- Do you have chocolate?
- Yeah, of course!

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.774
Okay.
Come on, Beasley.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:48.310
You two seem to be
hitting it off quite nicely.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:52.180
Oh, Beasley.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:53.682
Yeah, though I'm pretty sure

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.784
she has her heart set
on someone else.

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:59.154
- Yeah, I've been watching.
- Watching?

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:00.522
Well, not spying.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.424
I don't spy, I watch.
I observe.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:03.358
I was a teacher.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:06.094
It taught me a lot
about human nature.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.630
I used to see these kids.
They would...

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:09.943
well, they'd have crushes
on each other,

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.800
but they'd never
say anything about it,

01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:14.536
and I think they were
too embarrassed...

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:18.807
but yet, they always seemed
to find some reason to interact.

01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:21.943
Like walking the same dog,
Mrs. Gilbert?

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:23.511
Yeah.

01:06:24.715 --> 01:06:27.048
I think I've been playing along
quite nicely, don't you?

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.117
Yes.
Very, very nicely.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.852
I mean,
men are clueless sometimes.

01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.454
I mean that in
the most loving way.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.824
It's really quite sweet, and
then, of course, there's Dan.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.727
He's so proud of
his matchmaking skills.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:40.328
I don't want him
to be disappointed...

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:44.532
but I did kind of make sure
that I was at the shelter

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:46.935
the second time your grandfather
came to walk the dog.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:51.740
- Your grandpa's kind of hot.
- Mrs. Gilbert!

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:55.410
- No, seriously. He's hot.
- Stop!

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.313
You know, women don't pick up
on things the way we do, Dan.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.215
That's why I had to play along,
you know,

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.017
and just act like I didn't know

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:04.719
it was more than Prince
she wanted to take a walk with.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:07.322
- So you're on to her?
- Of course I am.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.002
She doesn't realize it,
and don't tell her.

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.325
I don't want to embarrass her.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.860
Dr. Monroe...

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:13.895
who says an old dog
can't learn new tricks?

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:17.198
Who says I'm an old dog?

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:22.437
Yeah, but it's so obvious how
you two feel about each other.

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.239
Just say it.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:26.252
Your grandfather's telling me
everything I need to know

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.009
without ever saying a word.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:31.946
Sometimes, you need
to say words, Mrs. Gilbert,

01:07:31.982 --> 01:07:33.648
and sometimes,
you need to hear them.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:35.817
I mean...

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:38.086
this isn't a dress rehearsal.
It's our life.

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.455
Did you see that on
a pillow, or a sign?

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.225
A sign, actually.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:45.560
Look, the point is,

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:47.206
the two of you didn't just
find the perfect dog.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.197
You found each other.

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.067
Seize the day, remember?

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.436
I guess I should be
taking my own advice.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.604
Hey, you said it, not me.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:02.710
You want me to tell her
how I feel?

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.245
Dr. Monroe...

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:06.381
women, they want to hear
what's in your heart.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.827
You don't want her
to meet another dog,

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.250
start taking him for a walk?

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:10.385
No, I suppose not.

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:15.123
- So, I think we're finished here.
- Us too.

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:16.669
Let's go find Prince
and we'll take him for a walk.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:17.926
Great.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.500
Did you say I haven't
told you how I felt?

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:29.470
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah. Think they'll clue in?

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:30.772
Fingers crossed.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.944
- I'm so happy for them.
- Me too.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:38.746
You know, it's funny. I...

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:41.249
I know Mrs. Gilbert has
more life experience than I do,

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.752
but I think I was able to give her
some really good advice.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.787
Yeah. Me too.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.823
- I hope they clue in.
- Me too.

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:52.727
You keep saying that.

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:58.466
I've got to get
back to the shelter, so...

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:00.801
Yeah, I have some
appointments. Here.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.140
Thank you again for all of this.

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:08.042
Yeah, of course.

01:09:08.078 --> 01:09:09.978
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.345
Tomorrow.

01:09:11.904 --> 01:09:12.947
Tomorrow.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:26.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.634
Well, I...

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.313
think we're going to have
a great turn out tomorrow.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.636
Yeah, you know,

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.216
I didn't actually think
we could pull this off.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.340
Yeah...

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:42.076
So, you all packed up,
ready to go?

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:45.446
Look...

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:47.115
I know you're upset
that I'm going

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:50.718
and I'm leaving you
with the shelter, but...

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:53.555
No, I'm not...
anymore.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.957
I mean... I...
I mean it.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:10:00.128
I just don't want you to
be stressed out... anymore.

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.374
You know, I just
want you to know

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.831
that the shelter's
in good hands.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:08.169
I just hope that you are.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:11.639
I guess that's the
million-dollar question, hey?

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:14.175
Are you sure you don't
know the answer to that?

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.744
Maybe.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.080
Carly coming home brought back
a lot of memories,

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:23.084
a lot of feelings...
good ones...

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.919
and then suddenly,
I have to move

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:27.355
and give up the shelter
that I worked so hard to build,

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.557
make decisions
on the rest of my life?

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.962
I'm feeling torn...

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:36.831
but I can't help but wonder

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.366
if the feelings
that I have for Carly

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:41.002
are just a transference
of how I used to feel?

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:41.869
And maybe it's the same for her,

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.838
and she just doesn't
realize it yet.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:46.574
You both are seriously
attached at the brain.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.409
Look, you know...

01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:51.946
you don't need any more advice,
especially from me.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.581
I mean, you're my brother.
I love you.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:56.632
No matter what you decide,
I'm going to support you...

01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.854
but I will say this.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:02.223
Sometimes, it's not a decision.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.891
How so?

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:07.295
Sometimes, the universe
decides these things for us.

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:11.032
Just hope that you'll be
awake enough to get the clue.

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:14.769
Brother.

01:11:51.207 --> 01:11:53.775
Daddy, can I take one home?
Please!

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.444
Why don't we go take a look
at the one you want?

01:11:59.182 --> 01:12:01.494
We're going to run out of dogs
before we run out of people.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:05.753
I know... except for Beasley.
Keeps growling at everyone.

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:08.122
Well, I thought Dan
wanted you to adopt Beasley.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:11.159
Yeah, he does, but I just
can't right now, you know?

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:14.295
I don't know where I'm going
to live, and besides...

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:16.364
She'll just remind you of Dan.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.467
- Stupid, huh?
- No.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:21.536
Come on, let's go see
how the adoptions are doing.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:22.970
So remember,

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.673
if you've ever thought about
being adopted by a dog,

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.642
today is your day.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.977
Come on down right now
to Long Lake Park

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.980
and check out
all these canine cuties.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.717
And I'll be there to make sure
they find their perfect match...

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.218
you!

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:39.454
'Cause that's what
Dan the Dog Man does!

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.856
Come see him while you still can,
because tomorrow,

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:44.459
we'll be taking off
for New York, New York!

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:45.893
Keep watching.

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:48.496
We'll be back with one
last live update soon!

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:49.964
And cut!

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.868
We have officially been adopted!

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.337
That's great!
The both of you?

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.740
Well...

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.875
well, officially,
it's in Rita's name,

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.343
but I get visitation rights.

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:03.778
It's joint custody.

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.059
Great event, Carly.
You should be proud of yourself.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.416
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:09.729
We're going to dinner later
at The Grillhouse.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:10.551
Why don't you join us?

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:13.766
No, actually, I need to stay back
and help Michelle clean up,

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:14.822
but why don't you two...

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.357
or three...
enjoy yourselves.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.695
- See you at the house?
- Yeah.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.232
- Bye.
- Bye! Have fun!

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:27.068
- How cute are they?
- They're adorable.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:28.736
I'm so glad they finally
figured it out.

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:30.772
Hey!

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.840
I can't even begin to tell you
how amazing this is.

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:34.620
Yeah, I didn't think
this many people would turn out.

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:36.722
One of the things I'm going to do
when I get to New York

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:39.046
is sponsor events like this
throughout the country.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.616
I mean, people don't need
to go to pet stores.

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:42.784
There are so many shelters

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:44.263
with animals just waiting
for someone to give them a home.

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:45.987
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:48.589
You know, Dan, actually,

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.292
I'm pretty worried
about Beasley, you know.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:53.861
She's been really agitated.
She's snarling at everyone.

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.398
Maybe we should keep her
with one of us.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:58.733
Yeah.

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:05.440
Hey, we want to get
Beasley here.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.810
Come here, Beasley.
Come here.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:11.078
Alrighty.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.034
See, she just needed
some fresh air and sunshine,

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.651
See?
You're a good match.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:17.885
Yeah...

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.623
Finally!
It's about my job.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.558
I've been calling and calling,

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:24.559
and they're only now
just getting back to me.

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:26.127
Yeah, go, go.

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:27.628
Dan here.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:34.936
How's it going?

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.138
Well, we continue
to talk in metaphors.

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:38.673
We don't have time
for metaphors.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:39.952
Who's he talking to
on the phone?

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:43.744
- It's about his job.
- Well, he doesn't look happy.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.914
Where is Dan?
We are about to go live.

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.916
He's over there.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.518
Uh-oh.

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:52.620
What?
Why "Uh-oh"?

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.722
Be right back.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:58.092
Thank you.

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:04.866
We're on the air
in three minutes, babe.

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:05.901
That was my new boss.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.436
Regional Executive Director?

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:10.204
That job is filled,

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.973
and it's not vacating
any time soon.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:12.974
They want me on as a volunteer.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.977
Okay, I know how this sounds.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.446
I may have made a slight error
in my choice of words.

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:19.580
Choice of words?

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.660
You said I'm going to be
the Regional Executive Director!

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:24.619
Which is true!
It's a matter of semantics.

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:27.188
Once you get in there,
once you wow them,

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.689
you'll go right to the top!

01:15:28.725 --> 01:15:32.960
What I said is, you will be
the Regional Executive Director...

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.630
one day.

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.200
He looks pretty upset.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:44.138
- You manipulated me.
- I had to do something.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.407
Otherwise,
you wouldn't come with me!

01:15:46.442 --> 01:15:47.408
Look, I am doing you a favor

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:50.044
by getting you
out of this stupid hick town!

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:51.746
By lying to me?

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:54.081
Well, I'm not the only one
who lied to you!

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.684
- What are you talking about?
- Carly.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:00.354
She's been lying
to you for weeks.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:04.325
- I think I just heard your name.
- My name?

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.560
Yeah.

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:08.930
Oh, come on.

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:10.175
Anyone could see
right through it,

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:11.899
the way she's been playing you,

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:13.279
trying to make you think
she's still in love with you,

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.936
just so you would stay

01:16:14.971 --> 01:16:17.238
and nothing would happen
to these precious dogs!

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:20.741
- She wasn't playing me.
- Oh, see?

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:22.109
It worked!

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:23.711
<i>How bad?</i>

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.346
The last time I saw Kristi
this worked up

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:27.348
was when that five-year-old
crashed her live shot

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:29.083
and she threw an ice cream cone
at him.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:32.086
I don't know
what we're going to do.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:35.389
- You! You're on.
- What do you mean, I'm on?

01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:38.025
We're going live, unless
you want to go deal with that.

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:40.428
No, I don't.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:42.597
Then you!

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:43.864
What? No!
I, I, I... can't.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.300
You're cute.
Here, do it for the dogs.

01:16:46.336 --> 01:16:47.301
What?

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:48.603
You're already holding one.

01:16:48.638 --> 01:16:50.004
- You're a vet, right?
- Yeah...

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.250
Yeah!
Just look at the camera, smile.

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.207
You'll be fine.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:54.909
Love you!

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.750
And in five, four...

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.087
We're live!

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.390
Hi...

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:13.761
everyone.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.031
I'm Carly.
I'm a veterinarian

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:19.433
who volunteers
at the Forever Friends Shelter.

01:17:19.469 --> 01:17:23.504
Kristi and Dan are currently
predisposed with some other...

01:17:23.539 --> 01:17:25.006
dog business?

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:28.476
- She doesn't even like that dog!
- I'm sorry?

01:17:28.511 --> 01:17:30.322
That dog you're so in love with
that hates everyone?

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:34.081
- Carly adores Beasley.
- Oh, please.

01:17:34.117 --> 01:17:36.283
Nobody adores Beasley.

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:41.956
Carly's just telling you
what you want to hear.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:46.127
Look, she comes back after all
these years, expects you...

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.296
to drop everything for her.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.732
Who's manipulating who, huh?

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.473
Hey, listen,
we just wanted to thank everyone

01:17:59.509 --> 01:18:01.842
for making this
such a successful event,

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:03.110
and for you folks at home,

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:04.812
you'd better hurry up
and get down here

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.214
before your potential
forever friend

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.816
gets fetched up by someone else.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:12.286
I thought we were a team!

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.223
- What is she doing?
- Wait! It's live.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:18.225
Anyway...

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:21.062
there's still
one very special dog

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:24.732
that hasn't found someone
to love yet.

01:18:24.767 --> 01:18:25.966
Her name is Beasley.

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:31.739
See, dogs are special.
All animals are special, but...

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:33.207
there's just something

01:18:33.242 --> 01:18:35.342
about the unconditional love
of a dog

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:39.146
that makes the world
a better place...

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:40.881
and they're a lot like us.

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:43.718
Some are tall, some are short.

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.319
Some are less friendly
than others...

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:51.125
and some are more trusting...
caring...

01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:56.097
and like us,
they just want to be loved.

01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:59.834
They just want someone
to come home to...

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:03.370
to know that they have someone
who will greet them...

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:04.686
to know that they have a friend.

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:14.882
Sometimes, they actually do wish
that things turned out differently,

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.451
despite what
they may have said...

01:19:17.487 --> 01:19:18.519
or barked...

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:21.622
and...

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:25.559
the thing about Beasley here
is that she's independent,

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:27.595
and I think sometimes,

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:30.431
she worries
that she'll lose that,

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:35.035
so she tends to withdraw
and close herself off...

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:39.373
but she only does it
because she's scared.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:40.408
She's scared

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.283
that all those things
that I just talked about,

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:47.414
that she wants too,
just like everybody else,

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.284
that...
she'll never have them.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:54.989
I don't think that she needs
to be afraid anymore...

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:59.827
because her path
brought her here,

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:01.262
to this exact moment,

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:04.031
and there's nowhere else
she'd rather be.

01:20:06.836 --> 01:20:10.471
Those of you who know Dan
the Dog Man know what he says...

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.406
that we don't choose the dog...

01:20:14.277 --> 01:20:16.110
the dog chooses us...

01:20:17.446 --> 01:20:18.524
and you see, I got up here today

01:20:18.548 --> 01:20:22.850
to help find this girl
a new home, but...

01:20:22.885 --> 01:20:25.319
the truth is, I can't do that
because...

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:26.354
Beasley chose Dan...

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.392
and she really wants him
to stay...

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:35.629
because she loves him.

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:53.013
- I don't know what else to say.
- Say goodbye.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.617
Goodbye.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:01.590
And we're clear.

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:07.261
That's my girl.

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.869
Thanks.

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:16.315
- Oh, my gosh, that was so good!
- Really?

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.339
Yes!

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:23.978
Maybe the dog does
belong with you...

01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:27.915
and Carly.

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:29.483
Yeah...

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:30.885
she does.

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.356
Goodbye, Dan.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:39.526
Goodbye, Kristi.
Good luck in New York.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:49.670
Hi.

01:21:49.705 --> 01:21:51.872
Please don't go to New York.

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:55.609
- I'm not going to.
- You're not?

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:57.912
I wouldn't do that to Beasley.

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.081
I wouldn't do that to you.

01:22:02.818 --> 01:22:04.184
Carly...

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:08.924
I love you.
I always have...

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.227
and I always will.
