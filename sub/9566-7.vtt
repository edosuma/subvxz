01:23.613 --> 01:24.791
Acknowledged.

01:55.775 --> 01:58.000
Messerschmitt ME-262E...

01:59.657 --> 02:02.164
A Curtis P40 Kittyhawk...

02:02.925 --> 02:05.959
- A Hawker Typhoon...
- Night Fighter or Ground Attack?

02:06.175 --> 02:07.288
Ground Attack.

02:08.426 --> 02:09.883
A Focke Wulf 190...

02:10.508 --> 02:11.766
Gloster Meteor...

02:12.504 --> 02:14.029
Boulton Paul Defiant...

02:14.749 --> 02:15.872
and...

02:15.992 --> 02:18.760
Mitsubishi Zero.
I want that in Kamikaze spec.

02:19.465 --> 02:21.880
What's happened, JJ? I sold you
that one three weeks back.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.038
Collateral damage,

02:24.414 --> 02:26.240
quite a lot of it.
Rage incident, you know.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.717
Another one?

02:27.917 --> 02:28.917
'Fraid so.

02:29.304 --> 02:31.431
You taking those pills
they give you?

02:31.800 --> 02:34.680
- Of course. I'm the pill king.
- Maybe they stopped working, yeah?

02:35.170 --> 02:36.220
Impossible.

02:36.428 --> 02:38.437
Olanzipine, Risperidone
and Dextroamphetamine

02:38.557 --> 02:40.188
have unrivalled efficacy rates.

02:40.308 --> 02:42.172
Well, something's up, ain't it?

02:42.465 --> 02:44.461
I mean, deliberately destroying

02:44.581 --> 02:46.680
a Kamikaze spec Zero...

02:47.230 --> 02:49.136
That's gotta tell you something.

02:52.562 --> 02:54.469
Here, this'll cheer you up.

02:55.290 --> 02:58.000
I got cruise missiles
on special offer.

02:58.815 --> 03:00.542
- Intercontinental?
- Yeah.

03:01.088 --> 03:02.880
R62 Matador...

03:04.360 --> 03:05.482
the real deal.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.393
Nobody fucks ya
with one of these babies!

03:17.602 --> 03:18.320
Dear.

03:19.063 --> 03:21.872
- Can you remember where I live?
- Course I can.

03:22.322 --> 03:24.761
Terry died and you live
with the other ladies now.

03:24.881 --> 03:26.457
Oh, bugger!

03:41.615 --> 03:43.126
I don't want to.

03:43.606 --> 03:46.629
I'm telling you,
I don't like it. I can't come here!

03:46.749 --> 03:49.079
Don't be a silly bear.
It'll be fine.

03:49.199 --> 03:50.836
- Really?
- Really.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.912
I'll come and check on you later on.
Don't panic, yeah?

04:10.609 --> 04:11.609
Next.

04:16.185 --> 04:17.636
Eleven stone three.

04:20.908 --> 04:22.480
Metric, if you wouldn't mind, JJ.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.205
71.7 kilos.

04:25.085 --> 04:26.400
Good, good.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.964
- Why do you always weigh me?
- We weigh everyone.

04:31.084 --> 04:32.685
Yes, but why?

04:34.819 --> 04:36.480
You don't have to worry about that.

04:36.892 --> 04:37.942
Well, I do.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.883
You know what we say about worrying.

04:41.837 --> 04:42.837
Just don't.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.515
That's right, just don't.

04:47.479 --> 04:48.915
Take a seat, lad.

04:51.027 --> 04:52.904
So, how have we been?

04:53.901 --> 04:55.345
It's complicated.

04:55.465 --> 04:56.715
Yes, of course.

04:58.015 --> 05:00.240
Got any new tricks for me?

05:00.927 --> 05:03.453
- I'm not doing magic any more.
- Really?

05:04.752 --> 05:07.719
- Have you been taking your pills?
- Yes. That's the thing,

05:08.032 --> 05:10.400
nobody likes magic,
or there isn't a point,

05:10.718 --> 05:12.832
or maybe they just
don't like me enough.

05:12.952 --> 05:14.128
- Who?
- My friends.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.719
- Your friends don't like you?
- I'm pretty sure of it.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.288
And why is that?

05:19.471 --> 05:21.920
Because if they liked me,
maybe they'd listen to me occasionally

05:22.080 --> 05:24.212
instead of fighting all the time
and hating each other.

05:24.332 --> 05:27.876
- I'm sure they don't hate you.
- I didn't say they hated me.

05:28.974 --> 05:31.720
- They hate each other.
- Well, there you go.

05:35.353 --> 05:37.118
I've been getting locked on,

05:37.911 --> 05:40.640
- breaking stuff, getting into rages.
- Don't do that.

05:40.851 --> 05:41.851
Right.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.113
I'll give you some new little pills.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.795
We can't get enough of them!
Take them at breakfast and supper, OK?

05:49.915 --> 05:51.096
Instead of what?

05:51.478 --> 05:54.003
No, as well as, JJ. As well as.

05:55.871 --> 05:57.720
Sitro Teasic Ulvaceous Neoprenes.

05:58.730 --> 05:59.984
Amusing, isn't it?

06:00.104 --> 06:02.798
Pretty effective blighters,
sort everything out.

06:06.946 --> 06:07.946
I think...

06:09.547 --> 06:11.959
I think I want to be...
normal, you know?

06:12.120 --> 06:14.238
Yes, so take those twice a day.

06:14.358 --> 06:16.119
No, I... That's not it.

06:16.797 --> 06:19.817
Freddie smashed Cook
and Cook stole his girl,

06:20.609 --> 06:22.051
and they're my best friends.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.652
- They don't sound like friends.
- No, you don't...

06:25.080 --> 06:28.366
They're my friends and they hate
each other because of Effy,

06:29.078 --> 06:31.681
and... But we love each other,
or at least...

06:31.801 --> 06:34.579
- You love a girl, that's normal.
- That's not it.

06:35.050 --> 06:36.160
I do love her, but...

06:38.487 --> 06:39.887
But that's not it.

06:44.924 --> 06:46.800
- I'm feeling angry!
- You're worrying.

06:47.053 --> 06:48.640
Yes! I'm worrying and...

06:49.097 --> 06:52.280
- I'm worrying, and...
- So just don't do that, OK?

07:37.064 --> 07:38.364
What a surprise.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.160
Emily, what are you...?

07:48.126 --> 07:49.339
We don't say.

07:49.459 --> 07:50.449
It's OK.

07:50.569 --> 07:53.524
Yes. It's all right.
It's just I don't expect...

07:54.506 --> 07:56.769
I don't usually see people
I know in here.

07:56.889 --> 07:57.719
Why not?

07:58.195 --> 08:00.080
Because normal people
don't come here.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
Right.

08:04.509 --> 08:06.394
I've been having
a bit of counselling.

08:06.713 --> 08:07.713
Nice.

08:08.911 --> 08:12.077
I asked them to help me to be a bit
more honest with people, you know?

08:12.197 --> 08:14.160
Anyway, they just gave me these.

08:17.035 --> 08:18.035
Snap.

08:19.219 --> 08:21.966
Must be good if they can help you
calm down and be more honest.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.160
It wasn't really
what I was hoping for.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.720
Do you need calming down?

08:29.159 --> 08:30.909
Believe me, I totally do.

08:31.451 --> 08:33.485
I'm getting overstimulated
just talking to you now.

08:33.605 --> 08:36.078
I mean, you're exciting me.
Wait! That's not...

08:37.328 --> 08:39.559
- Bugger! Shitification!
- It's all right, JJ.

08:40.655 --> 08:43.557
It's hard telling people
things about yourself, isn't it?

08:46.400 --> 08:47.800
But I'm gonna try.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.523
It's no big deal.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.160
- Probably couldn't care less.
- About what?

08:56.270 --> 08:58.082
I want to have sex with girls.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.558
- Right.
- Yeah. I like girls.

09:03.678 --> 09:05.027
I like sex with girls.

09:05.147 --> 09:08.720
I like their rosy lips,
their hard nipples, bums, soft thighs.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.788
I like tits and fanny, you know?

09:11.398 --> 09:14.080
There, I've said it and now...

09:17.165 --> 09:18.315
Fucking hell.

09:19.275 --> 09:20.960
Priazapan, Moraglutomol,

09:22.075 --> 09:23.880
Triculine, Rizzalin...

09:24.057 --> 09:25.799
The veritable Stun, as of today.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.437
That is a lot of drugs.

09:27.681 --> 09:30.350
Dietary supplements...
Ah, here's my vitamin C.

09:30.773 --> 09:33.719
I do about twenty of these a day,
cos they're nice and fizzy.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.229
Go on. Try one.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.774
You're supposed to dissolve them,
but they've got a better kick this way.

09:41.894 --> 09:43.160
Go on. Go!

09:47.750 --> 09:48.750
All right.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.597
I don't think you want to do that!

10:02.897 --> 10:03.897
Holy shit!

10:21.923 --> 10:24.122
I think you've got
your hand on my tit.

10:24.242 --> 10:26.293
I know. I mean... Shit, sorry.

10:29.409 --> 10:31.059
I've had a lovely time.

10:33.832 --> 10:35.845
I've screwed this all up, haven't I?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.850
Truth is...

10:41.574 --> 10:42.880
you're nice, JJ.

10:43.324 --> 10:44.424
I'm unusual.

10:46.033 --> 10:48.233
That's just code for "not normal".

10:51.138 --> 10:53.560
I'd give anything
to be normal for a whole day.

10:57.764 --> 10:59.993
If you were normal,
what would you do?

11:01.105 --> 11:03.831
I'd lose my virginity first,
several times.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.959
Then have a Choccy Nut milk shake
without going into shock.

11:07.079 --> 11:09.318
Then I'd tell Freddie and Cook to
stop fighting over Effy

11:09.438 --> 11:12.399
before they hate each other for ever,
and not make me take sides.

11:12.519 --> 11:15.758
And they'd listen to me for once
and not fucking ruffle my hair!

11:15.878 --> 11:18.599
And then I'd tell Effy I loved her
and lose my virginity a few more times.

11:18.950 --> 11:20.150
You love Effy?

11:21.269 --> 11:22.640
Did I say that out loud?

11:23.146 --> 11:24.146
'Fraid so.

11:25.771 --> 11:26.771
Retard!

11:27.320 --> 11:29.861
I'm a retard!
Nut job! Bat case!

11:29.981 --> 11:33.725
Spaso! Mong! Autistic
fucking fruitcake mental basket!

11:33.845 --> 11:36.373
- You're getting locked on!
- Shitty Looney Tune. One Flew Over...

11:36.493 --> 11:37.840
The Fucking Cuckoo's Nest!

11:38.203 --> 11:39.240
Look at these!

11:46.965 --> 11:48.160
That worked.

11:52.028 --> 11:54.883
Last guy to see my tits
wasn't quite as impressed.

11:57.191 --> 11:59.191
I suppose I should be leaving.

12:01.031 --> 12:02.131
You know, J,

12:03.028 --> 12:04.664
all those things you want,

12:05.194 --> 12:06.743
you don't ask for them.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.440
Why don't you just ask?

12:15.524 --> 12:17.102
Can I see your breasts again?

12:19.245 --> 12:21.470
Let's start
with the easy stuff, yeah?

12:25.172 --> 12:27.800
- So where do we start?
- We?

12:34.603 --> 12:36.629
- I'm going to be normal.
- Right.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.886
- Normal, normal.
- Ring the bell, JJ.

12:42.518 --> 12:45.545
- What are you gonna say?
- {\I'm }Gonna ask him to make up with Cook.

12:45.665 --> 12:48.357
Gonna ask him to forget Effy,
because she's not good for us.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.391
Gonna ask him to
stop ruffling my hair.

12:53.212 --> 12:55.280
- Don't let anything stop you.
- Right.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.286
- Tell her.
- Karen, if you don't mind,

13:04.406 --> 13:06.448
- would you please not ruffle...
- Hang on.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.480
What are you doing here?

13:09.578 --> 13:10.640
Do I know you?

13:14.920 --> 13:15.840
Fucking hell!

13:20.369 --> 13:22.480
I want to see Freddie
and I want to see him now.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.868
It's OK, Karen.
I know which bedroom it is.

13:27.988 --> 13:30.108
Yeah, but this is going to be good.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.440
It's uncanny.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.060
What...?

13:36.976 --> 13:38.605
He's definitely in there.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.683
I'm just a bit busy
at the minute, J. Sorry.

13:44.803 --> 13:46.559
We'll do this another time, then.

13:46.803 --> 13:49.240
For Pete's sake.
Get out of the way!

14:05.056 --> 14:06.056
Now,

14:06.755 --> 14:08.804
does everybody know each other?

14:08.924 --> 14:10.751
That's great. Brilliant, Karen.

14:10.871 --> 14:12.840
For Christ's sake,
what are you doing?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.119
I'm doing the Great fucking
Northern Run, what does it look like?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.160
Guys, could we please just...?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.080
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.

14:21.241 --> 14:23.902
Maybe my postal application
hasn't reached you yet.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.229
Now, do you mind? We're sort
of in the middle of something.

14:28.694 --> 14:30.800
That's not right.
You want Eff and she's not...

14:30.960 --> 14:33.944
It's a free country, JJ.
Maybe my weirdo sister's up for it.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.640
That's ridiculous, Emily's gay.
I wanted to talk to you.

14:37.462 --> 14:40.073
- We can do this another time and...
- Quality!

14:43.099 --> 14:44.120
That's not true.

14:45.720 --> 14:46.720
Is it Ems?

14:48.317 --> 14:50.720
Because you promised me
that wasn't true.

14:59.570 --> 15:00.570
Shed.

15:16.101 --> 15:17.640
So what did you want to tell me, J?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.158
- Has she gone yet?
- None of your business!

15:26.515 --> 15:28.154
Right arse you made of it.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
I want...

15:35.016 --> 15:37.890
- I want things to change.
- Things have changed.

15:38.010 --> 15:39.599
They change all the time.

15:40.329 --> 15:42.335
Doesn't it matter what I think?

15:42.455 --> 15:45.415
Because I think it should
matter more, you know.

15:47.585 --> 15:48.585
So?

15:53.450 --> 15:54.920
We're supposed to be friends.

15:55.257 --> 15:56.960
- For ever.
- I can't do it, J.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.079
Just because of a girl.
You don't even want Effy.

15:59.272 --> 16:01.199
Don't tell me what I want!

16:01.361 --> 16:03.061
Then tell me what to do.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.346
You've gotta choose, mate.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.667
Either me or Cook.

16:09.755 --> 16:11.107
And what about me?

16:11.587 --> 16:12.787
Don't I count?

16:16.738 --> 16:19.080
- I'm not the one who's telling fibs.
- Let it alone, J.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.275
I'm...

16:22.361 --> 16:23.611
the normal one.

16:43.598 --> 16:44.598
Mum...

18:18.201 --> 18:20.789
- <i>Gay J, man. Where you been?</i>
- Doing stuff.

18:21.424 --> 18:23.380
<i>Been days, J-Lo. What's going on?</i>

18:23.992 --> 18:25.896
Like I said. Stuff and...

18:27.185 --> 18:28.347
- stuff.
- <i>Well...</i>

18:28.467 --> 18:30.956
<i>You did that nutty professor
thing today, yeah?</i>

18:31.870 --> 18:34.021
My assessment. You remembered?

18:34.521 --> 18:36.243
<i>JJ, am I your bestest or what?</i>

18:36.363 --> 18:39.164
<i>Anyway, you're coming to Thomas's
shindig tonight at the Roxie?</i>

18:39.284 --> 18:42.379
<i>Non-negotiable. He's putting
a band on an' all, it'll be sweet as!</i>

18:43.496 --> 18:45.706
- Can I ask you something?
- <i>Ask me later J-Lo.</i>

18:45.826 --> 18:48.295
<i>I got business to attend to.
Keep taking them mad pills,</i>

18:48.415 --> 18:49.778
<i>and I'll see you later.</i>

18:51.634 --> 18:53.231
<i>I love that barmy fucker.</i>

18:54.039 --> 18:56.167
<i>"Everyone's gotta have a mate
who's a twat</i>

18:56.287 --> 18:58.610
<i>and who's not gonna try
and finger your pussy candy.</i>

18:58.730 --> 19:00.030
<i>Like you, babes.</i>

19:01.551 --> 19:02.706
<i>You getting it?</i>

19:04.757 --> 19:05.757
<i>You there?</i>

19:06.816 --> 19:07.979
<i>How about here?</i>

19:08.477 --> 19:10.070
<i>Like that. Grab my balls...</i>

19:12.609 --> 19:14.120
<i>Just fucking like that.</i>

19:16.418 --> 19:17.268
Guys...

19:26.201 --> 19:27.960
I'm not gay. I'm not anything, OK?

19:28.310 --> 19:29.379
Fuck off!

19:42.777 --> 19:44.436
How come he gets a lolly?

19:44.556 --> 19:47.470
- Yeah, that's gay.
- Totally gay!

19:47.590 --> 19:49.200
He's so gay. That's...

20:32.250 --> 20:33.500
Anyone home?

21:05.802 --> 21:07.180
What the fuck!

21:08.920 --> 21:10.500
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry.

21:10.620 --> 21:12.859
- I'm sorry!
- Give me my T-shirt,

21:12.979 --> 21:14.360
fucking hopeless perv.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.801
I'm sorry. The door was open.

21:18.420 --> 21:20.360
- I got worried.
- About what?

21:23.195 --> 21:26.040
I dunno. I thought you might have...
I dunno, OK?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.873
I was pissed at the two of you.

21:27.993 --> 21:29.074
Two of who?

21:30.415 --> 21:33.132
I heard what you were saying.
I want you to stop doing that.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.120
- What the fuck?
- You and Cook.

21:35.441 --> 21:36.895
I haven't seen him for days.

21:37.015 --> 21:39.280
Don't dis me while you're having
sexual intercourse,

21:39.441 --> 21:41.456
because you might think
it's funny but I...

21:41.576 --> 21:42.480
Sorry?

21:51.365 --> 21:54.040
Are you going to give me some fucked up
hint what you're talking about?

21:56.451 --> 21:58.800
I usually drink mango juice
when I get over stressed.

22:23.601 --> 22:24.401
So?

22:30.875 --> 22:33.372
I think it must be these new pills
they've given me.

22:34.791 --> 22:36.960
Vivid dreams. It's a side effect.

22:37.555 --> 22:39.320
Cool. Let's do a couple now.

22:39.581 --> 22:40.952
Get off our faces.

22:41.942 --> 22:43.540
It does other stuff, too.

22:43.660 --> 22:44.660
Like?

22:45.174 --> 22:47.720
Calms you...
makes you tell the truth, allegedly.

22:48.611 --> 22:50.123
What's wrong with that?

22:51.234 --> 22:52.134
Dunno...

22:52.558 --> 22:53.363
dunno.

22:55.048 --> 22:56.762
Come on, JJ. Don't be pathetic.

22:56.882 --> 22:58.880
It's easy.
Just tell me something true.

23:01.572 --> 23:02.510
Tell me.

23:04.199 --> 23:05.560
- Tell me now!
- I love you.

23:10.211 --> 23:11.661
Everybody loves me.

23:14.565 --> 23:15.768
That's a relief.

23:15.888 --> 23:18.920
With the possible exception
of darling Ma and Da.

23:19.396 --> 23:21.099
They don't love me so good.

23:21.463 --> 23:22.575
Why's that?

23:24.129 --> 23:26.280
Cos I won't let them fuck up
their lives in peace.

23:26.866 --> 23:29.348
So I'm being a total bitch
to both of them.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.221
What did they...

23:31.676 --> 23:34.800
She fucked his boss and he behaved
like a complete dildo as usual.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.000
Sounds bad.

23:39.087 --> 23:40.486
It's well bad, JJ.

23:40.911 --> 23:42.727
I'm officially off the rails.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.080
You should try it.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.935
I can't go off the rails.
My Mum... she needs me to be OK.

23:49.055 --> 23:50.355
I have to be OK.

23:51.429 --> 23:53.460
Is that why you take all the pills?

23:55.184 --> 23:56.080
Pretty much.

24:01.299 --> 24:03.107
Please leave them alone, Effy.

24:04.885 --> 24:05.685
Who?

24:07.574 --> 24:09.263
I don't mean to be rude but

24:09.878 --> 24:11.520
Cook, Freddie and me,

24:11.680 --> 24:14.231
they're the only friends
I've ever had and...

24:15.595 --> 24:19.240
you've basically ruined everything
and I'd like you to stop now.

24:31.702 --> 24:33.255
I can't do that, J.

24:34.982 --> 24:35.982
Why not?

24:44.190 --> 24:46.139
- Thanks for loving me.
- No problem.

24:46.259 --> 24:47.935
I'd like to be your friend.

25:51.425 --> 25:52.784
Nice, babes.

25:53.878 --> 25:54.680
Nice.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.388
Cookie, stop it.
I gotta go...

25:58.480 --> 26:00.880
- I'm going.
- I'm coming and coming!

26:17.374 --> 26:19.783
Mac J, the Lord High Chieftain of J.

26:24.898 --> 26:26.698
Winding up for a big one tonight?

26:26.818 --> 26:28.376
Dunno, Cook.
I don't know.

26:28.496 --> 26:29.682
Course you are.

26:29.802 --> 26:31.341
Me and you, J, tonight,

26:31.461 --> 26:34.160
we're setting course
for the heart of the fucking sun.

26:35.199 --> 26:36.457
You just arrived?

26:38.000 --> 26:38.907
Did you...

26:39.884 --> 26:42.640
- you see anyone on the way out?
- I just arrived.

26:43.381 --> 26:44.266
Cool.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.258
You missed my tip top, rumpy pumpy,

26:48.378 --> 26:50.520
bangs like a rabbit, secret lover.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.402
Really?

26:53.789 --> 26:55.360
Don't you want to know who she is?

26:56.160 --> 26:56.960
Who is it?

26:58.943 --> 27:01.419
I'm not telling you, man.
Even the Cookie monster knows

27:01.539 --> 27:02.986
when it's time for schtum,

27:03.106 --> 27:06.043
Otherwise the shit's gonna
dismantle the fan.

27:07.239 --> 27:09.548
But she can't fucking help herself{\though, man},
I'm telling you.

27:09.668 --> 27:10.789
If it's wrong,

27:11.196 --> 27:12.762
why are you doing it?

27:13.288 --> 27:16.080
Because it's life, J. You gotta
get in there and never fucking stop.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.840
Shit's waiting to be done.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.483
If you're not gonna do it
you're a pathetic pussy fart.

27:20.603 --> 27:22.200
What would be so bad about stopping?

27:25.431 --> 27:27.893
- What about other people?
- Fuck other people, J.

27:28.094 --> 27:29.757
Fuck 'em!
Let's blow.

27:30.930 --> 27:32.092
The thing is...

27:33.201 --> 27:34.821
you didn't answer my question.

27:35.859 --> 27:37.689
What would happen if you stopped?

27:41.583 --> 27:42.560
Look at me.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.640
What else have I got?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.512
Please make up with Freddie.

27:48.632 --> 27:51.280
- It doesn't work. It just...
- Freddie can fuck himself.

27:51.616 --> 27:52.989
He was asking for it, yeah?

27:53.109 --> 27:55.109
- What was he asking for?
- He's pissed

27:55.229 --> 27:57.745
- cos I've got something he wants.
- You don't care, leave her alone.

27:57.865 --> 28:00.285
- {\It's not like }You're going out with her or anything.
- She likes it mindless.

28:00.405 --> 28:01.705
So do I. Sorted.

28:02.494 --> 28:06.000
Now, are you coming or do I have to keep
look out myself when I'm buying gear?

28:07.575 --> 28:08.759
Just care. OK?

28:09.604 --> 28:11.668
- About what?
- About me!

28:11.788 --> 28:13.223
About me, you twat!

28:13.800 --> 28:15.248
You're all fucking twats!

28:29.930 --> 28:30.789
Here...

28:32.020 --> 28:32.874
Here...

28:33.925 --> 28:35.800
I pissing love you, J.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.211
Nothing's gonna change that, man.

28:44.238 --> 28:46.120
You're my very own little fruit bat.

28:47.054 --> 28:48.204
Fuck Freddie.

28:48.987 --> 28:50.400
It's just me and you now.

28:51.448 --> 28:52.565
Feel the love.

28:55.181 --> 28:56.441
You feeling it?

28:58.911 --> 28:59.740
Right.

29:00.124 --> 29:01.424
Now, let's walk.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.775
I want to get mentalled.

29:03.895 --> 29:06.147
We've got
pharmaceuticals to purchase.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.920
Eight for one fucking pill?
I'll pay you £8 for three!

29:13.400 --> 29:15.116
I don't give a shit.
It's £8 a pill.

29:15.236 --> 29:18.041
What pills are they
you charge me £8 for?

29:18.254 --> 29:20.344
If you don't want the pills,
then don't come to me...

29:20.464 --> 29:22.160
It's not about the fucking money...

29:27.480 --> 29:29.531
It's £8 for maybe three or four...

29:29.651 --> 29:31.793
You don't want the pills,
you can fuck off!

29:36.467 --> 29:39.459
Police... stop! You're under arrest!

29:43.777 --> 29:44.795
Come back!

30:09.192 --> 30:11.469
Shit, I thought
it was getting dodgy down there.

30:11.589 --> 30:13.040
But you still went?

30:13.973 --> 30:15.240
I needed to get stuff.

30:17.746 --> 30:20.194
No fucking gear in this town. Shit.

30:21.225 --> 30:22.445
Manage without?

30:23.740 --> 30:26.285
That'll be no kind
of night out now, will it, J?

30:27.015 --> 30:29.560
- I need to get something.
- I can do without.

30:29.842 --> 30:32.870
- I don't need spliff or pills...
- All right. All right!

30:34.973 --> 30:37.472
And by the way,
that's so fucking not true.

30:38.593 --> 30:40.650
I don't drink, I don't do weed,

30:41.280 --> 30:43.354
- I don't do class A...
- You're pilled up every day.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.160
Nothing fancy about you,
so don't fucking come it.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.647
All right.

30:50.947 --> 30:53.274
- You can have some of mine.
- Mad pills?

30:54.713 --> 30:55.960
You wanna get mad, right?

30:58.432 --> 30:59.547
Stun?

31:03.260 --> 31:04.878
- What do they do?
- A lot.

31:04.998 --> 31:06.766
You need to take two or three.

31:06.886 --> 31:07.885
Go on then.

31:09.821 --> 31:11.376
I've already taken mine.

31:13.028 --> 31:14.199
There you go.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.991
Or possibly you're pussy.

31:17.931 --> 31:18.731
Pussy.

31:33.181 --> 31:34.831
Let the party commence.

31:42.803 --> 31:43.981
D'you mind?

31:45.332 --> 31:46.659
Stupid bitch!

31:51.360 --> 31:52.360
You OK?

31:53.314 --> 31:54.214
No Cook?

31:55.015 --> 31:57.320
- Why would there be a Cook?
- You're seeing him, aren't you?

31:57.687 --> 32:00.560
I'm fucking him occasionally.
I'm not seeing him.

32:01.621 --> 32:02.760
There's a distinction?

32:07.201 --> 32:08.193
No Emily?

32:09.680 --> 32:10.520
Truth.

32:13.228 --> 32:14.418
That obvious?

32:14.538 --> 32:17.120
Don't have to be a genius
to work it out.

32:18.693 --> 32:20.240
- So?
- So I'm straight.

32:20.588 --> 32:21.336
Sure?

32:25.886 --> 32:26.968
If I said no,

32:28.360 --> 32:31.784
- would I regret it?
- Probably. But not because of me.

32:36.609 --> 32:37.858
We're objects of lust.

32:37.978 --> 32:40.277
- Making you feel good?
- Not really.

32:41.261 --> 32:42.863
I suggest we go in here

32:42.983 --> 32:45.080
and get so monumentally fucked up,

32:45.323 --> 32:46.923
we forget all about...

32:56.920 --> 32:58.760
My god. That's fucked up.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.639
- You love him?
- No

33:02.240 --> 33:03.600
You love The Lips.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.760
Oh, my god. Go on, lie to me.

33:06.428 --> 33:07.879
I want to see this.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.240
Here, come!

33:10.761 --> 33:12.910
You don't pay. Friends don't pay!

33:15.503 --> 33:17.920
Isn't this great?
I've sold a load of tickets.

33:19.862 --> 33:20.959
Here, come! Come!

33:22.719 --> 33:25.762
Welcome, welcome <i>mes amis</i>!
Club Thomas is pleased to receive you!

33:25.882 --> 33:26.882
All right?

33:29.488 --> 33:31.807
Aren't you gonna be
bitchy to me, Katie?

33:32.688 --> 33:33.751
Yeah, sure.

33:34.909 --> 33:36.080
Give me time.

33:39.629 --> 33:40.680
Listen, everyone,

33:40.840 --> 33:43.118
everything is great,
totally super great.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.200
More friends!

33:47.121 --> 33:49.436
Wait until you see this place.
You will not believe it.

33:50.427 --> 33:52.120
And the band are formidable!

33:52.502 --> 33:55.519
Everyone is together, Panda is coming,
and Emily's already here.

33:57.153 --> 33:57.980
Where?

35:07.471 --> 35:08.476
Fuck you.

35:09.612 --> 35:10.889
You fuck off!

35:25.953 --> 35:27.639
What the fuck's he on?

35:35.200 --> 35:36.390
How many, JJ?

35:38.779 --> 35:39.808
How many?

35:39.928 --> 35:41.954
Four... Then another two.

35:42.074 --> 35:45.160
- You twat! What does this stuff do?
- Calms you down...

35:45.321 --> 35:46.321
and stuff.

35:46.581 --> 35:48.079
Right. You see that?

35:53.017 --> 35:54.920
You stupid fucking idiot!

36:25.000 --> 36:27.515
- And what the fuck were you doing?
- I'm sorry...

36:27.635 --> 36:29.160
I'm sorry.
He pissed me off.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.026
How?

36:30.146 --> 36:32.689
It doesn't matter.
Just say he's gonna be all right.

36:32.809 --> 36:36.592
He's gonna be all right. He's always
fucking all right, aren't you, Cook?

36:37.037 --> 36:38.360
- Aren't you?
- Don't.

36:48.913 --> 36:50.163
Top pills, man.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.360
I knew you'd come for me,

36:57.844 --> 36:59.091
Three Musketeers.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.381
Fuck off, Cook.

37:01.501 --> 37:03.240
Freddie, she loves you, you know.

37:08.581 --> 37:09.581
What?

37:10.074 --> 37:11.274
She loves you.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.329
But she can't stand it.
Can't stand the love,

37:14.449 --> 37:16.550
- so she fucks me instead.
- What's he saying?

37:18.329 --> 37:19.200
What?

37:19.648 --> 37:20.648
Shit.

37:21.221 --> 37:23.289
I think you're gonna get the truth.

37:24.415 --> 37:26.476
- Cook?
- I'm pissed off, yeah?

37:27.821 --> 37:30.919
She's taking the piss
and it's hurting me.

37:31.394 --> 37:33.258
Cos Cook needs the love too.

37:35.344 --> 37:37.480
- Cookie's got nothing.
- Everything all right, guys?

37:38.821 --> 37:40.840
Cookie's always got nothing.

37:41.323 --> 37:42.897
That's why I do her pal.

37:45.486 --> 37:47.340
That's why I pop Panda.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.434
Panda's popped.

37:51.324 --> 37:53.839
It's always the same great tits Panda,
great tits Effy.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.601
That's all I get cos I'm shit.

37:59.267 --> 38:00.670
I'm pure shit.

38:08.681 --> 38:09.739
Back off.

38:14.246 --> 38:16.280
- He does not deserve friends!
- Yeah.

38:18.517 --> 38:19.617
He's a cunt.

38:24.289 --> 38:25.921
Move! Move!

38:35.655 --> 38:37.562
You've had a busy day,
haven't you, J?

38:37.682 --> 38:38.682
I'm sorry.

38:39.379 --> 38:40.679
I got locked on.

38:42.025 --> 38:43.600
You all pissed me off.

38:46.768 --> 38:48.920
Does this mean
I can't come to the shed anymore?

38:53.226 --> 38:55.659
Course not,
you can still come to the shed.

38:59.494 --> 39:01.299
Just give me some space, OK?

39:02.188 --> 39:03.480
I need time to think.

39:05.453 --> 39:06.960
What's going on? Someone said he...

39:14.552 --> 39:15.920
It's yours, I think.

39:50.688 --> 39:51.991
How are you doing?

39:54.759 --> 39:55.759
Here.

40:00.486 --> 40:01.625
There you go.

40:07.769 --> 40:10.986
According to the diagnosis,
I'm liable to social dysfunction.

40:11.563 --> 40:13.586
They shouldn't let me out really.

40:14.177 --> 40:15.411
It's OK, JJ.

40:16.257 --> 40:17.693
You did me a favour.

40:18.055 --> 40:19.055
I did?

40:21.228 --> 40:22.399
Katie loves me.

40:22.897 --> 40:24.197
I know she does.

40:25.177 --> 40:26.240
Yes, definitely.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.040
Did you do it?

40:33.657 --> 40:35.144
Did you ask for stuff?

40:38.148 --> 40:39.754
I did a fair bit of...

40:39.874 --> 40:40.874
asking.

40:41.701 --> 40:42.999
And how did it go?

40:44.450 --> 40:46.905
I'd say bad on the face of it.

40:47.025 --> 40:48.928
But in another sense,

40:49.321 --> 40:51.400
you might say it's too early to say.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.381
Too early to say.

41:01.013 --> 41:02.905
I don't want to go home tonight.

41:03.639 --> 41:05.680
- Katie's too...
- Locked on.

41:07.787 --> 41:09.087
She's locked on.

41:10.752 --> 41:12.443
I don't want to go home.

41:13.296 --> 41:14.280
I can't.

41:17.456 --> 41:18.456
Right.

41:19.849 --> 41:21.132
So let's think.

42:05.731 --> 42:08.720
Please tell me somebody
makes you wear those pyjamas.

42:10.006 --> 42:11.200
I just like them.

42:11.842 --> 42:13.320
They're 100% Egyptian cotton,

42:13.480 --> 42:15.192
which is good cos rayon derivatives

42:15.312 --> 42:17.392
and other man-made fibres
can interfere with...

42:17.512 --> 42:20.280
If we're going to be my friends,
you can't wear teddy bears any more.

42:20.815 --> 42:21.965
Get them off.

42:22.564 --> 42:23.858
Right. You got it.

42:24.428 --> 42:25.478
No teddies.

42:26.082 --> 42:29.161
I've got some others
with World War One Fighter planes on.

42:37.349 --> 42:39.147
I'm asking for something, JJ.

42:41.889 --> 42:43.651
Yup and I'm saying yes.

42:43.771 --> 42:46.188
But possibly a phased approach
might be more...

42:47.237 --> 42:48.437
Take them off.

42:49.259 --> 42:50.345
Don't be silly.

42:50.465 --> 42:52.821
Take them off now, JJ,
and get in here.

43:03.454 --> 43:06.232
This is a once only charity event,
you understand.

43:06.954 --> 43:08.739
Got you. Because you're gay.

43:10.378 --> 43:11.378
I'm gay.

43:18.871 --> 43:19.984
Get on with it.

43:36.842 --> 43:37.875
In you pop.

43:44.269 --> 43:45.807
I'm lots of things, JJ,

43:46.204 --> 43:47.682
and I really like you.

43:48.223 --> 43:50.185
So this is between friends, yeah?

43:52.853 --> 43:54.153
Between friends.

43:59.133 --> 44:00.706
And I can be quite cute.

44:01.757 --> 44:02.757
You can.

44:36.110 --> 44:37.452
Mum, this is Emily.

44:41.601 --> 44:42.826
A friend of mine.

44:57.379 --> 44:58.972
Would you like some tea?

44:59.870 --> 45:01.400
Yeah, please. Thanks.

45:06.887 --> 45:08.545
So how was it last night?

46:23.904 --> 46:25.200
Beware the moon.
