THAT CERTAIN THINGS

10:05.600 --> 10:07.533
HAVE COME
TO MY ATTENTION.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.833
THINGS THAT COULD HAVE

10:08.867 --> 10:09.867
VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
FOR YOU.

10:13.067 --> 10:15.633

OR HEAR ABOUT IT EVER AGAIN.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.700
AM I CLEAR ON THAT?

10:19.733 --> 10:21.167
VERY CLEAR, SIR.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.167
OTHER SOLDIERS
LOOK UP TO YOU, WILLIAMS,

10:24.200 --> 10:25.867
AND THEY DON'T
NEED TO SEE IT

10:25.900 --> 10:28.067
OR HEAR ABOUT IT
EITHER.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.367
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.000
I'M NOT GOING TO
SUBMIT YOU FOR REVIEW.

10:32.033 --> 10:34.533
HOPEFULLY NO ONE ELSE WILL
EITHER,

10:34.567 --> 10:37.000
BUT YOU NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.867
THIS HAPPENS AGAIN,
I WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.467
I CAN'T DECIDE.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.067
HOW MUCH ARE THEY?

11:37.733 --> 11:38.867
I THINK YOU SHOULD
UNDERWRITE

11:38.900 --> 11:40.200
A THIRD WORLD
COUNTRY INSTEAD.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.367
WELL, CATHERINE'S BUYING THEM.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.933
HELENA, DON'T WORRY.

12:00.967 --> 12:03.067

I WANT TO. OKAY?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.233
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON NOW.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.700
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
RISKED MY MONEY

12:06.733 --> 12:08.100
AT THE HORSE RACES LIKE THAT.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.367
IT WAS STUPID.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.467
WAIT, WAIT. I'M SORRY.

YEAH, BUT SHE'S RIGHT.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.533
OH, PLEASE!

12:14.567 --> 12:15.933
IT WAS HER TIP ON THE HORSE.

LOOK, SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO HELP ME

12:22.767 --> 12:23.967

13:08.433 --> 13:11.700
NO, I DON'T THINK
I DO KNOW HER.

13:14.700 --> 13:18.500
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL,
BUT WHERE AM I SUPPOSED--

13:18.533 --> 13:21.500
OKAY, I'LL SEE
IF THEY HAVE A ROOM FOR ME.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.667
THAT SHE CAN HAVE
HER HOTEL SUITE.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.167
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO STAY?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.967
WHY DON'T YOU COME
STAY BACK WITH ME?

13:49.067 --> 13:50.733
NO, ALICE, I CAN'T.

13:50.767 --> 13:51.900

WE DON'T WANT BIRDIE
TO FEEL GUILTY

14:02.367 --> 14:04.100
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S PUTTING ME
OUT IN THE STREET.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.100

I'M GOING TO GET BOTH OF THESE.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.433

NO, I'M NOT
FORGETTING ANYTHING, PHYLLIS.

I SAW THOSE GIRLS.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.733
YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE THEM.

15:55.767 --> 15:57.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NOT LIKE THEM"?

15:57.567 --> 15:59.800

16:02.800 --> 16:04.933
YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:04.967 --> 16:06.200
AND STOP
PSYCHOANALYZING ME.

IS A FACT OF LIFE.

THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY

17:03.100 --> 17:04.300
GOING TO GET ME
TO COME BACK TO YOU

17:04.333 --> 17:05.500
BY INSULTING ME
AND EXALTING YOURSELF?

17:05.533 --> 17:06.800
I DON'T CARE

17:06.833 --> 17:09.800
IF I NEVER HAD A LOVER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

17:09.833 --> 17:13.700
MY LIFE IS GOING TO BE
SO WONDERFUL

17:13.733 --> 17:15.467
BECAUSE I KNOW WHO I AM

17:15.500 --> 17:16.700
AND I'M BEING HONEST
WITH MYSELF.

17:16.733 --> 17:17.867
DON'T YOU GET IT?

17:17.900 --> 17:19.967

HE LEFT HER FOR SOME NEIGHBOR
