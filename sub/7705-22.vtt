WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:04.670
For heaven's sake..

00:04.672 --> 00:07.639
Kate, you're not selling
my ship in a bottle, are you?

00:07.641 --> 00:08.841
If we're lucky.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.542
But I...I love that ship.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.978
It-it's the<i> Nina.</i>

00:12.980 --> 00:15.948
Willie, the whole reason
we're having a garage sale

00:15.950 --> 00:17.683
is to get rid of things.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.518
Well, we don't have to be
fanatics about it.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.723
Listen, I've been
going over the bills.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.693
Someone should take
your credit cards away.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.861
Give me those.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.295
Is that a typo?

00:30.297 --> 00:32.965
An $11,000 balloon payment?

00:32.967 --> 00:35.134
No, it's accurate.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.935
You guys are
getting ripped off.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.972
You can get a whole package
of balloons for 69 cents.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.442
No, no, ALF, seven years ago

00:43.444 --> 00:45.978
we took out
a mortgage on the house.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.280
Just to buy a balloon?

00:48.282 --> 00:50.349
Look, could we not talk
about this right now?

00:50.351 --> 00:53.118
We've only got a week to get
ready for the garage sale.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.620
You're selling the garage?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.155
(Willie and Kate)
No!

00:56.157 --> 00:58.991
Well, that's good because
we're gonna need someplace

00:58.993 --> 01:00.926
to store that balloon.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.598
[theme music]

01:37.031 --> 01:39.031
[music continues]

02:07.995 --> 02:09.027
[instrumental music]

02:10.598 --> 02:12.064
So you understand
what a balloon payment is?

02:12.066 --> 02:13.332
Yeah.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.000
And you know what
a garage sale is?

02:15.002 --> 02:17.336
- Yeah.
- Good.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.739
Now, can you explain
secular humanism again?

02:22.042 --> 02:23.475
No.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.545
Hey, you're not
selling that, are you?

02:26.547 --> 02:29.715
- I'm afraid so.
- Too bad.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.183
It'd be a great bottle
if it weren't

02:31.185 --> 02:33.852
for the ship stuck in it.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.687
It's a<i> Nina.</i>

02:35.689 --> 02:39.858
Well, sorry, on Melmac
we didn't name our bottles.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.895
It doesn't matter.

02:42.897 --> 02:44.863
We're selling it anyway.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.865
This house payment's hanging
over your head, isn't it?

02:46.867 --> 02:50.602
No, we're just trying to clear
away a little extra space.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.138
Level with me.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.907
You're on the skids, aren't you?

02:54.909 --> 02:56.375
No.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.044
Dad, mom wants me
to sell Muffy Bear.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.646
And<i> Scooter.</i>

03:00.648 --> 03:02.080
No!

03:02.082 --> 03:05.751
Now, look, we've got
to be strong about this.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.755
Not my hockey stick. No!

03:12.593 --> 03:14.293
Knock, knock.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.296
- Who's there?
- Hi, kids.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.698
- "Hi kids," who?
- Hi, grandma.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.701
Stop it.
You're ruining the joke.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.736
Excuse me, kids,
I love you very much

03:24.738 --> 03:27.239
but there's something
I've gotta watch on TV.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.209
- What?
- A horse race.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.945
(man on TV)
'...with Fast Grand
showing the way by a length..'

03:32.947 --> 03:34.613
Hi, mom,
oh, good, you brought

03:34.615 --> 03:36.381
some more
stuff for the garage sale.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.383
Shh! Come on,
Smooth As Butter!

03:38.385 --> 03:41.053
Come on,
Smooth As Butter!

03:41.055 --> 03:42.888
Mom, do you have money
on that horse?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.189
(man on TV)
'...the final eighth
of a mile'

03:44.191 --> 03:45.724
'and it's Smooth As Butter..'

03:45.726 --> 03:49.895
Whoo! Whoo! Yeah. I won.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.098
Mom, since when do you
bet on horses?

03:53.100 --> 03:55.067
All my life.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.770
Ha! That's funny. I-I can't
picture you at a race track.

03:58.772 --> 04:03.108
I could picture
her running. Ha! Ha!

04:03.110 --> 04:05.043
I wonder how long
it would take

04:05.045 --> 04:07.846
to pull the hair
out of your body?

04:08.449 --> 04:11.016
About two hours.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.419
Mom, how come you never
took me to a race track?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.488
I never go to a race track.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.757
You meet
an unsavory element there.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.760
- I bet with a bookie.
- Ah!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.729
They're not unsavory.

04:23.731 --> 04:28.200
Forgive my ignorance,
but what's a bookie?

04:28.202 --> 04:30.302
An unsavory element.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.771
You mean like oregano?

04:33.707 --> 04:37.542
Nick The Fish
is not unsavory.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.379
"Nick The Fish?"

04:40.381 --> 04:42.814
You bet with a fish?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.218
- Oh, hi, Dorothy.
- Hi, Willie.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.121
Willie, did you know
my mother bets on horses?

04:49.123 --> 04:50.956
Yeah.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.191
So how much did
you win, grandma?

04:53.193 --> 04:54.693
Three hundred bucks!

04:54.695 --> 04:57.262
Hey, that's even better
than last week.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.764
Well, that's fine, mom.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.599
But I mean,
what if you had lost?

05:00.601 --> 05:03.268
Hey, it's my money.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.271
But it's our inheritance.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.708
For your information, I'm
planning to leave all my money

05:09.710 --> 05:12.010
to the alien task force.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.613
Sure, punish
your grandchildren.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.415
Oh, leave us out of this.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.850
- That's her plan.
- Come on, mom.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.019
Let's take this stuff
in the kitchen and tag it.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.654
I'll give you a hand
with these old clothes.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.223
Yeah, I've, I've got
fliers to make.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.026
Well, I might as well
make myself useful.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.595
Hold on, Dorothy.

05:30.597 --> 05:34.099
Can you make a lot of money
with this horse racing thing?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.201
Only if you win.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.502
No problem.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.971
Put me in for 50 bucks.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.907
Where did you get 50 bucks?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.942
Have you been going
through my purse again?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.846
Yes, but that's not
where I got the money.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.882
By the way,
you're out of Tic-Tacs.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.318
Where did you get
the 50 bucks?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.153
Rebate coupons.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.123
Anyway, if you'll just
slip 50 to Mr. Fish--

05:58.125 --> 06:01.993
- Mintz.
- No, thanks. I just brushed.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.497
His name is Nick Mintz

06:05.499 --> 06:08.433
and I'm not gonna
place any bets for you.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.669
I'm not doing this for me!

06:10.671 --> 06:13.972
No, you're raising
money for charity.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.242
Oh, excellent comeback, Dorothy.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.879
Well, if you must know
it's for a balloon payment..

06:20.881 --> 06:25.684
...which, by the way, has
nothing to do with a balloon.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.053
Well, I don't care
what it has to do with.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.723
I am still not gonna place
any bets for you.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.793
And it was a dynamite comeback.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.365
Once again...
left to my own devices.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.769
[instrumental music]

06:45.606 --> 06:48.540
Don't you believe in knocking?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.810
- This is our room.
- I know that.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.546
Uh, what may I ask
are you doing in here?

06:54.548 --> 06:56.948
I have to make a private call.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.884
Now, you two
just go back in there

06:58.886 --> 07:01.453
and do whatever you were doing.

07:01.455 --> 07:05.957
- We were brushing our teeth.
- No need to cover.

07:05.959 --> 07:10.061
I think it's great that you kids
still keep the flames burning.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.298
Thanks for the feedback.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.733
Now, will you leave?

07:14.735 --> 07:17.202
Yeah, after my call.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.805
Who are you calling
at this time of the night?

07:19.807 --> 07:22.941
Do I pry
into your personal life?

07:24.411 --> 07:26.878
Look, it's kind of a surprise.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.114
What did we say about surprises?

07:29.116 --> 07:32.584
I know, but it's
a good surprise.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.320
Just trust me.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.956
- Please?
- Okay.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.493
- Two minutes.
- Thanks.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.895
Oh, and close
the door behind ya.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.701
[door slams]

07:55.976 --> 07:59.678
Hello? Is this The Fish?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.745
Great.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.814
Listen, you don't know me

08:02.816 --> 08:06.651
but I'm a friend
of Dorothy Halligan's.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.420
Yeah, big red.

08:08.422 --> 08:11.690
Listen, if I send you 50 bucks

08:11.692 --> 08:16.495
can you turn that
into $11,000?

08:16.497 --> 08:20.131
No problem.
I've got till Saturday.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.267
(man on radio)
'They're racing stride
for stride in this race.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.302
'It's Out Of Body Experience
by a neck'

08:24.304 --> 08:26.505
'but here's Naughty Nina
on the outside.'

08:26.507 --> 08:29.774
'Here comes Naughty Nina
and Out Of Body Experience'

08:29.776 --> 08:32.410
'and it's Naughty Nina
by a nose!'

08:32.412 --> 08:34.346
Alright! Yeah!

08:34.348 --> 08:36.414
[indistinct radio chatter]

08:36.416 --> 08:40.151
'...Out Of Body Experience..'

08:40.153 --> 08:42.521
Nick? ALF.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.456
Yeah, I was listening.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.824
Not bad, huh?

08:45.826 --> 08:48.527
Fifty bucks at 6 to 1 odds?

08:48.529 --> 08:52.397
Let's see, that means I won..

08:52.399 --> 08:53.765
...three million dollars!

08:53.767 --> 08:56.067
Wow! Yea..

08:56.069 --> 08:59.104
What? Three hundred dollars?

08:59.106 --> 09:02.307
Oh. Well, uh, let it ride.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.643
(man on radio)
'...and it's Cat Killer
by half a length.'

09:04.645 --> 09:05.810
Yeah!

09:05.812 --> 09:08.046
I've got the Midas touch.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.983
Okay, Nick, yeah, let's go
fifties on four in the fifth

09:11.985 --> 09:14.486
five in the sixth,
six in the seventh

09:14.488 --> 09:16.288
and seven in the eighth.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.723
Then, at Hialeah,
what I'd like to do is..

09:18.725 --> 09:20.759
So, that's a C-note
on the double

09:20.761 --> 09:22.861
then one each
on the two exactas.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.729
Yeah, a deuce on the quinella

09:24.731 --> 09:26.665
and a half on the perfecta.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.568
And remember,
nothing on the pick six.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.403
I don't wanna seem greedy.

09:31.405 --> 09:35.340
Thanks. And my best
to the fish-wife.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.749
Kate, I think your neighbors

09:44.751 --> 09:46.718
are having
a garage sale today, too.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.553
You're kidding.
The Ochmoneks?

09:48.555 --> 09:50.755
Yeah, they got a couple
of beat-up chairs

09:50.757 --> 09:53.091
and an old sofa
out on their front lawn.

09:53.093 --> 09:57.062
Oh, yeah, that's
the way it always looks.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.397
Mom, how come dad's
hockey stick's not out there?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.666
Well, it should be.
I know I put it out there.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.468
Oh, it's right
next to the bottle

10:03.470 --> 10:06.338
with the Mayflower in it.

10:07.774 --> 10:11.509
It's not the Mayflower,
it's the<i> Nina.</i>

10:11.511 --> 10:14.613
Hey, come here, Willie.
I want you to see this race.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.215
Oh, I haven't got time to watch
a horse race now, ALF.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.518
Not a race, this is<i> the</i> race.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.055
This is the one that's
gonna make you very happy.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.090
(man on TV)
'...ending on the outside..'

10:25.092 --> 10:27.792
Keep your eye on number nine.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.895
You mean,
the one that just fell down?

10:30.897 --> 10:35.033
Uh, yeah.
That's the one.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.869
- He's not getting up.
- He will. He will.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.672
Maybe he dropped something.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.407
Well, at least
the jockey is okay.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.210
Who cares? Get up!

10:46.246 --> 10:47.679
Get up!

10:47.681 --> 10:49.047
Well, thank you, ALF.

10:49.049 --> 10:53.051
If you'll excuse me,
I have to put these away.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.894
Nick! ALF.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.530
Does that race count?

11:05.532 --> 11:06.798
Alright, alright.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.034
How much am I up?

11:09.036 --> 11:12.037
Oh, well, then,
how much am I down?

11:14.074 --> 11:16.875
Oh. Well, I have
to make it back fast.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.044
Put 2000 on..

11:19.046 --> 11:23.214
What? What do you mean
I can't bet anymore?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.984
No! No, there's no reason
for you to come over here.

11:25.986 --> 11:29.521
Uh, I'll be happy to put
a check in the mail.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.290
Hello? Hello?

11:34.494 --> 11:35.760
Kate.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.063
- Quick question.
- Yeah?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.498
Hypothetical situation..

11:40.500 --> 11:44.335
...an individual places a bet
with a, a professional bookie

11:44.337 --> 11:47.038
okay, for a sizable
amount of money.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.910
Let's say, uh, $6000..

11:51.912 --> 11:53.278
...and he loses it

11:53.280 --> 11:56.381
and he can't
cover his losses.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.149
Hypothetically..

11:58.151 --> 12:00.552
...what could happen
to this individual?

12:00.554 --> 12:04.322
Well, hypothetically, he could
have his legs broken.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.092
Why do you ask?

12:08.128 --> 12:11.396
Just making conversation.

12:11.398 --> 12:15.467
Well, I'm...
glad we had this talk.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.471
Get up!

12:22.843 --> 12:24.275
[instrumental music]

12:30.016 --> 12:33.952
You think I can get
six grand for this?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.920
More like a quarter.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.922
Well, it's a start.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.324
ALF, these are your
favorite things.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.959
What do you want to
sell them for?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.495
I wanna do my part
for the garage sale.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.565
Help the family out of
their financial troubles..

12:47.567 --> 12:49.300
...by 5 o'clock.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.670
ALF, we don't have
any financial troubles.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.572
- We do now.
- What?

12:54.574 --> 12:55.507
Nothing.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.776
Here's some more
of your stuff, ALF.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.277
Oh, look, a slinky.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.249
<i> Careful!</i> Don't get
a kink in that.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.418
I need to get 500 bucks for it.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.720
You won't.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.688
Yeah? Well, what about this?

13:10.690 --> 13:14.759
A genuine Melmacian
survival knife.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.964
There's no blade.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.700
Well, life on Melmac
wasn't that tough.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.904
ALF, you have some
really nice things here, but..

13:25.906 --> 13:28.273
...I really don't think
they're worth all that much.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.743
Alright, I was hoping
I wouldn't have

13:31.745 --> 13:36.181
to part with this but,
uh...here it is.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.951
My collection
of bouillabaseball cards.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.753
What's bouillabaseball?

13:41.755 --> 13:46.424
It's like regular baseball,
only you throw fish parts.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.296
- Which parts?
- What difference does it make?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.198
How much will you
give me for this?

13:54.401 --> 13:57.335
- Nothing.
- Wait! Don't answer yet.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.339
What if I threw in an attractive
12 piece set of cookware?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.107
Now, what would you pay?

14:03.109 --> 14:06.744
- Mm. Three dollars.
- Sold.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.747
- ALF, I'm not buying that.
- We had a deal!

14:09.749 --> 14:11.149
I didn't mean I'd buy it.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.185
I just thought you wanted
to know what it was worth.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.589
You're right. I did.

14:17.591 --> 14:18.790
Sorry.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.361
Do you really need
to go to college?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.665
[instrumental music]

14:34.274 --> 14:37.408
Kate, we haven't
sold one thing.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.711
Well, it's-it's, uh,
only been an hour.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.548
Maybe we should've
served food.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.384
Mom, this is
a garage sale, not a<i> luau.</i>

14:47.787 --> 14:49.387
Well..

14:49.389 --> 14:51.155
Kate, nobody's buying anything.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.324
I know that!

14:53.326 --> 14:56.294
It's just an observation.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.430
I'm gonna see if we have
anything in the refrigerator.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.766
(female #1)
Excuse me.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.868
I have a question about
the price on this lamp.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.236
It's negotiable.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.437
Well, I hope so.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.972
A thousand dollars
is ridiculous.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.975
- A thousand dollars?
- There must be some mistake.

15:10.977 --> 15:14.045
Uh, th-this looks like the
handwriting of a-a two-year-old.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.681
Or someone much, much older.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.550
Uh, pardon me, but, uh,
you can't really be charging

15:19.552 --> 15:21.953
$2,500 for this coffee pot.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.555
You can have two and a half
lamps for that price.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.458
Uh, we are willing
to come down.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.061
I'll give you five bucks.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.262
[scoffs]

15:31.264 --> 15:32.630
You expect us to come down

15:32.632 --> 15:36.367
from twenty-five hundred dollars
to five?

15:36.369 --> 15:37.669
Let's look next door.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.271
I saw a nice sofa
on the lawn.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.375
Kate. Kate. Are you
out of your mind?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.978
Thirty-four hundred dollars
for steak knives?

15:46.980 --> 15:50.515
I think this could explain
why the sales have been slow.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.152
Maybe you don't understand
the concept of a garage sale.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.355
Uh, mom, uh, could you check,
uh, the rest of the prices

15:57.357 --> 16:00.191
while Willie and I
go in the house and investigate.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.492
Well, I..

16:04.898 --> 16:06.297
Excuse me, ma'am..

16:06.299 --> 16:08.833
...do you have any more
of these $800 screwdrivers?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.639
- ALF!
- ALF!

16:14.641 --> 16:16.374
- ALF!
- Oh, where is he?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.709
(ALF)
'Down here!'

16:19.946 --> 16:22.080
(Willie)
'Well, what are you doing
down there?'

16:22.082 --> 16:23.381
Shaking.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.952
Come on out.
We know what you did.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.022
You do?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.791
Just tell us why you did it?

16:33.793 --> 16:36.494
I was trying to make
a little money.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.197
Where did you get
such a crazy idea?

16:39.199 --> 16:40.999
From your mother.

16:41.001 --> 16:44.035
- It was her bookie.
- Bookie? What bookie?

16:44.037 --> 16:46.237
[doorbell rings]

16:46.239 --> 16:48.539
That bookie.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.609
What does a bookie have
to do with our garage sale?

16:51.611 --> 16:55.213
Kate, do I have to fill in
all the blanks?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.247
Just stay here.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.016
Uh, we'll talk about this later.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.084
No! No, don't answer it!

17:00.086 --> 17:01.719
- Let go, ALF.
- No!

17:01.721 --> 17:02.954
Get o-o-off!

17:06.726 --> 17:08.926
My life isn't worth
a plugged nickel.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.231
Willie, what is going on?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.732
I have no idea.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.969
Maybe your mother's bookie
will know.

17:17.971 --> 17:20.505
ALF Tanner, Nicky Mintz.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.974
Hi. Kate, this is Mr. Mintz.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.009
Call me Nick.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.044
The Fish.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.845
Whatever makes you comfortable.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.814
ALF, you sound
different in person.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.115
You got a cold too?

17:31.117 --> 17:32.383
Uh, no, no.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.385
I've been sick for a month.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.654
Been taking everything.
Nothing works.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.556
Uh, have you tried
lemon juice and honey?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.925
You know, my wife
suggested that

17:40.927 --> 17:44.162
but I can't digest citrus.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.197
You can try the honey
without the lemon.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.100
Yeah, maybe I'll try that.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.536
So, where's my money?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.338
Your money?

17:54.340 --> 17:57.308
Come on, ALF,
just give me the six grand

17:57.310 --> 17:59.610
so I can go home
and use the vaporizer.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.148
Six grand?

18:04.150 --> 18:07.051
You think I placed
a bet with you

18:07.053 --> 18:11.789
and now I owe you<i> $6,000?</i>

18:12.759 --> 18:16.027
Yeah, that's the<i> general</i> idea!

18:18.498 --> 18:21.866
Come on, give me the money.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.067
Bless you.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.802
Thank you.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.706
Mr. Mintz, I'm afraid
I don't have $6,000.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.443
You'll find it.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.512
Because if you don't find it

18:34.514 --> 18:39.684
well...let's keep
that...hypothetical.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.719
[shatters]

18:41.721 --> 18:43.621
[sneezes]

18:43.623 --> 18:45.990
I should take better care
of myself.

18:48.962 --> 18:54.465
Willie...where are we
gonna find $6,000?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.968
Maybe somebody will
buy the folding chairs.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.474
I, Gordon Shumway,
being of sound mind and--

19:03.476 --> 19:06.110
I beg to differ.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.079
Well, I re-tagged everything.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.881
Now, who changed the prices?

19:09.883 --> 19:13.084
Oh, we have rounded up
the usual suspect.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.519
He placed a bet
with your bookie

19:14.521 --> 19:15.920
and lost six grand!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.288
Uh..

19:17.290 --> 19:21.025
When you say it,
it sounds so sleazy.

19:21.027 --> 19:24.162
And now,
the<i> mob</i> is after him!

19:24.164 --> 19:27.031
Well, at least some
good came out of this.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.800
What are you guys
doing in here?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.837
- Yelling at ALF.
- Is he in trouble again?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.105
Yeah.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.573
What does it involve this time?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.842
Food or money?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.645
Have I become that predictable?

19:40.647 --> 19:42.747
This time, he seems
to have incurred

19:42.749 --> 19:45.116
a rather large gambling debt.

19:45.118 --> 19:48.486
Yeah and your<i> grandmother </i>
is largely responsible.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.788
- What? Me?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

19:50.790 --> 19:52.990
You introduced me
to horse racing

19:52.992 --> 19:57.662
knowing full well
how obsessive-compulsive I am.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.698
I depend on you people
to protect me from myself.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.000
I have a response to that.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.736
But it's not
an informed response.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.474
Look, I did what I did
for good reason.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.578
To keep you people
out of the poorhouse.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.147
By getting us
hopelessly in debt?

20:16.149 --> 20:18.115
Good strategy.

20:18.117 --> 20:21.385
Well, how did you expect
to make that balloon payment?

20:21.387 --> 20:24.488
With this pitiful
garage sale of yours?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.725
By the way,
did the steak knives go?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.595
ALF, we put aside
the money

20:30.597 --> 20:34.465
for the balloon payment
a long time ago.

20:34.467 --> 20:38.836
Oh. Well, can I
borrow six grand of it?

20:38.838 --> 20:42.406
I can help.
I have almost $6 saved up.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.008
And I've got a little money.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.676
No one in this family
is giving money

20:45.678 --> 20:48.012
to ALF to cover
his gambling losses.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.382
- Dad, he was trying to help.
- Oh, you're right.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.416
You're right.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.118
ALF, will 6,000 be enough?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.453
Or, uh, shall we advance you

20:55.455 --> 20:58.122
for the next time
you try to help?

20:58.124 --> 21:00.057
Thanks for the sarcasm, Willie.

21:00.059 --> 21:04.595
<i> Somewhere</i> out there is
a meat hook with my name on it!

21:04.597 --> 21:06.464
[doorbell rings]
Oh, my gosh, he's back!

21:06.466 --> 21:07.698
Don't answer it!

21:07.700 --> 21:11.168
Mom, i-is Mr. Mintz
a violent man?

21:11.170 --> 21:14.205
Yes...but he's fair.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.406
[doorbell rings]

21:15.408 --> 21:17.642
Let's all slip out
the side door.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.777
We don't have a side door.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.346
Well, why don't we?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.315
Just finish your will!

21:24.317 --> 21:27.051
Oh! Uh, you guys,
g-go out in the driveway.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.753
See if anybody
is buying anything.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.854
Okay.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.559
You know, we're a lot alike.

21:35.561 --> 21:38.095
We just can't keep ourselves
out of trouble.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.501
Oh, thank God.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.436
- Excuse me?
- No.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.772
Nev-nevermind.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.140
Yes?

21:49.142 --> 21:50.408
Hi, uh, Carl Buck.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.909
I-I was at your garage sale

21:51.911 --> 21:53.511
and I found something
I'd like to buy

21:53.513 --> 21:55.513
but I'm not sure
if you're selling it.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.114
- Everything outside's for sale.
- Yeah.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.617
This thing looked like
a spaceship.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.185
Except the spaceship.

22:01.187 --> 22:04.288
Uh, not that it is a spaceship.
It could be anything.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.391
It's perfect
for the film we're doing.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.627
"Film?"
Wh-who exactly are you?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.896
Oh, oh, forgive me.
I'm a set decorator.

22:11.898 --> 22:15.266
Well, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

22:15.268 --> 22:19.503
And I-I was looking for props
for our film "Jupiter Guys."

22:19.505 --> 22:22.006
And that ship would be
perfect for it.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.708
You sure you don't
wanna sell it?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.510
Oh, no, no,
we couldn't possibly.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.014
- Why not?
- It has sentimental value.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.782
Would you, uh,
consider renting it?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.017
- No.
- For how long?

22:33.019 --> 22:36.620
- Willie!
- No more than a week.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.790
Uh, no.
No, we couldn't really.
