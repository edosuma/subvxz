You don't like being on your own,
do you?

33:18.100 --> 33:22.099
Then why push everyone away?

33:22.220 --> 33:25.539

33:25.540 --> 33:29.539
..why?

33:29.620 --> 33:32.259
I don't know.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.339
You know, I'm the last one 'ere.

You've done everything
to try and get shot of me.

Now this.

33:53.020 --> 33:55.939
You've...

33:55.940 --> 33:59.939
You've fucked the woman that I love.

34:02.020 --> 34:06.019
Why would you want to hurt me
so much, Dad?

34:11.300 --> 34:15.299

They're wrong, obviously.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.439
Idid not pick that.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.079
No, I couldn't get the colour
you wanted, so I thought

38:51.080 --> 38:53.599
I would give this a go. Just do one
wall, see what you thought.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.879
Paint no more!

38:54.880 --> 38:56.679

on your dear mother's face.

Tough call, I know,
but I thought it was worth a try!

39:17.560 --> 39:21.559
I'll be in the pub if you need me,
hacking me ear off.

He won't.
