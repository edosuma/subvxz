Good lord, Shake. Look at
your blood pressure, man.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.400
It's astronomical.
- Awesome.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.800
I told you I was good, son,
and now my blood proves it.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.400
It's bad, Shake.
It's off the charts.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.900
You're just jealous of
my live-fast lifestyle.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.900

And you can suck it.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.100

01:03.100 --> 01:05.200
Yes, my friend. For
a very long time.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.700
If both my hands were not
tingling and not responding to

01:07.800 --> 01:09.300
my brain impulses right now,

01:09.700 --> 01:12.900
I would shove you so hard for
stepping to me like this.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.600
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Your hands are tingling?

01:14.600 --> 01:16.600
And so is my face.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.500
You see how my left eye
is drooping with rage?

01:19.500 --> 01:21.200
Don't press my buttons!

01:21.200 --> 01:22.500
Meatwad, call 911!

01:24.900 --> 01:26.600
Okay, the cow's on his
way with the chicken.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
And look here. He
bringin' a dolphin.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.700
What happened?

01:32.700 --> 01:34.300
It's okay. It's okay, Shake.
Just relax.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.000
Lean back. You collapsed, man.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.700
I must've seen my
reflection and gone nuts.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.500
That's just how it happens to women.
- Here. Get well soon.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.900
I brung you some flowers
from Carl's yard.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.800
And Carl sends his wishes, too.
He said he wished you was dead,

01:48.800 --> 01:52.000
'cause all this here
come from Carl's yard.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
Okay, look, Shake.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.000
They're gonna let you out
of here today, all right?

01:55.100 --> 01:58.800
But you need to start exercising, and
you need to start changing your diet.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.800
Well, nobody exercises
on "Hawaii Five-O."

02:01.800 --> 02:05.200
I'm pretty sure they surf sometimes.
- Unh-unh. That's CG.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.400
And stop throwing "Hawaii Five-O" in
my face, okay? That's a terrible argument.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.500
You're right.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.900
It's time for me to stop relying
on that "Hawaii Five-O" crutch.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.200
I got to make some changes.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.400

02:34.900 --> 02:36.200
You're just gonna die.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.600

You just pop it
open and chug it...

03:05.700 --> 03:07.600
With vodka. You know,
they taste bad.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.400
You want to try one?
- You'd do that for me?

04:27.800 --> 04:31.900
He threw me through a damn wall.
Ooh, he broke your treadmill.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.200

What the [belch] are <i>you</i> looking
at?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.600
I'm looking at my, uh, shoes and now
at this weird spot on the floor.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.500
I definitely ain't
looking at you, sir.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.600
Good, 'cause my ball just went in.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.000
So did this one and this one.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.200
And all of these went in, right?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.700
Right? Right?
- E-e-excellent shot.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.700
What'd you say to me? Huh?!
- I said you won.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.000
What?
- You won.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.700
What?!
- You're very good.

05:20.700 --> 05:21.800
What'd you say to me?!

05:21.800 --> 05:23.600
And you should take all of this money,

05:23.700 --> 05:25.600
and it's getting late, and
I should be going home.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
How about a free ride?
- Oh, don't do that.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.000
Hyah!
- Ohh!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.100
What are you looking at?!

05:30.100 --> 05:31.800
You see something you like?!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.300
What are you looking at?!
- Aah!

05:36.000 --> 05:36.900
Oh!

05:37.600 --> 05:40.600
Shake. Shake.
Wake... wake up, man.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.800
Oh, I slept so hard.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.900
Did you, uh, go out last night?
- No, I didn't.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.400
Question me again, and the
sting will come fast.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
I'm... I'm just saying.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.200
There's this story all
over the news this morning

05:53.400 --> 05:54.900
about a white milkshake
with a pink straw

05:54.900 --> 05:57.500
beating the crap out of
about 15 guys downtown.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.000
Well, that wasn't me.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.100
So these 15 wallets down
here aren't yours, either?

06:02.100 --> 06:05.400
No. Of course not.
- This one's attached to some jeans.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.500
I wouldn't be caught
dead in those jeans.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.100
And these jeans are
attached to a...

06:10.100 --> 06:11.600
A human pelvis.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.200
Look, Shake. You know
I trust you, man.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.200
A-and this doesn't
sound like you.

06:16.400 --> 06:19.500
So stop asking, or I'll ask
you to leave the room.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.500
And it'll be rhetorical, friend,
'cause you'll already be three

06:22.500 --> 06:23.900
blocks away with a caved-in

06:24.000 --> 06:26.900
head wearing your ass
like a dog collar!

06:27.000 --> 06:29.500
Yeah, how about you
open your ears, Frylock,

06:29.700 --> 06:32.000
and listen to my... chest,
which is talking?

06:32.500 --> 06:37.600
You listen, too, drink cup, 'cause I'm only
gonna say this once. I'm running the show.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.500
And if you cross me,
I'll cross your legs

06:39.600 --> 06:42.000
in a direction they
ain't supposed to go!

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
May I... may I ask, please,
who... who you are?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.400
I'm your muscles! You get one
question, and you used it.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.600
Next question!

06:49.800 --> 06:53.500
How... how did you get there?
- I told you... one question!

06:53.500 --> 06:55.200
But then you said,
"next question."

06:55.300 --> 06:57.700
The next time you open your
mouth, it'll be to show the

06:57.700 --> 06:58.900
dentist what he's gonna be

06:58.900 --> 07:02.900
working on for the next
six months [belch] teeth!

07:03.000 --> 07:05.900
Frylock. Will you please
ask my muscles a question?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.300
I used all my questions.
- I'd rather not.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.100
Now <i>I</i> ask the questions. Um...

07:11.100 --> 07:14.300
Where the [belch] is
my muscle beverage?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.600
And you better say "close by."

07:16.700 --> 07:19.200
It's called "Thump,"
and, uh, Carl has some.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.600
He's, uh, an East Coast

07:20.600 --> 07:23.300
distributor, but he doesn't like
it when we visit, but that's...

07:23.400 --> 07:25.100
Absolute... we'll
just go visit him.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.800
We'll just go, 'cause you really
seem intent on meeting him.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.400
Carl! Get your fat ass out
here with my muscle juice!

07:32.600 --> 07:35.800
Carl, you need to do everything
he says as fast as you can.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.200
Uh, hey! Oh, no, no.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.500
Wait! Back away from the home
entertainment cen... I still got

07:40.500 --> 07:42.400
three more payments
on that plasma!

07:43.100 --> 07:47.100
Shut the word hole in your face before
I fill it with angry diarrhea.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.100
I want all the rest of your
muscle drink right now!

07:50.100 --> 07:51.200
Here. I got a new...

07:51.200 --> 07:54.300
New... new flavor... new
flavor, blueberry butt-rape.

07:54.800 --> 07:59.100
Uh, uh, uh.
14...american... dollars.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.600
Did I stutter?
- Oh!

08:04.700 --> 08:08.500
Shoot, I don't have $14.
Um... Do you have $14?

08:08.500 --> 08:10.400
Don't look at me. I'm broke.
- Try these.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.000
It's, uh... they're
muscle mints.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.700
And I've got some vitamins, and
they're free, too. Here. Take them all.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.200
Give me all of them!

08:18.700 --> 08:19.800
Um, a little warning?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.500
What the hell did you just do?
- They're muscle relaxers, see?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.400
Oh, that's good.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.500
I thought you were, like, trying
to compete with the muscle mints.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.300
A turf war ain't good for
business for neither of us.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.000
Hey. How about a
little help here?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.900
You won't be able to move
your muscles, Shake,

08:32.900 --> 08:35.400
but it's not gonna last very long,
so we need to work fast.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.299
Are you out of your mind?!

08:37.500 --> 08:40.299
Listen, when he wakes up, he's
gonna kick all our asses.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.100
Not me. I'll be gone.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.400
So he'll probably take all
his frustrations out on you.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.800
And he'll be pissed.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.600
What you gonna do, muscle man?

08:48.900 --> 08:50.500
It's all quite simple.

08:50.500 --> 08:55.300
Frylock is going to take my brain
and put it into the body of Jay-Z.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.400
I can't do that.
- Wha... oh, you don't know him?

08:57.400 --> 08:59.800
I knew him back when
he was J-Zimmerberg.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.900
Look, Shake, I have an idea,
but you might not like it.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.300
Just answer me this...

09:04.400 --> 09:07.700
Is it better than putting my
brain inside the body of Jay-Z?

09:07.700 --> 09:09.700
Uh, it's a little more
realistic than that.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.600
You're gonna put my brain
inside the body of...

09:12.200 --> 09:13.400
Schoolly D?

09:13.800 --> 09:16.700
Yeah, I could do
that... for $10,000.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.600
A'ight. $500.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.900
So, this wooden time machine
will take me back to

09:23.900 --> 09:25.900
before the muscles
took over my body?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.100
Um... no. This is known
as a veal-fattening pen.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.200
So you get to hang out here all day,
and the muscles will just melt away.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.100
Oh. And you can do
this all in one day?

09:36.100 --> 09:37.500
Well... a lot of days.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.900
Hey, turn on the lights,
or I'll turn on your head!

09:40.000 --> 09:41.800
I'll turn off your head!

09:41.900 --> 09:45.800
The lights will go out in your head,
'cause you'll have energy-saving balls.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.900
I don't have a good saying
here, but I'm pissed!

09:47.900 --> 09:49.600
We should go.
- Wait, wait, wait!

09:49.600 --> 09:51.400
What's gonna entertain
me all day?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.800
Well, your neighbors seem real nice.
- Come on!

09:53.800 --> 09:56.300
They're freakin' cows!
- When I get a chance...

10:01.300 --> 10:04.500
Hey, Shake. It's me, Meatwad.
- Oh, bad muscels are gone.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.900
You're free now, Shake. Shake?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.600
Moo!

10:08.600 --> 10:11.200
Oh, no. He's turned.
- What does that mean?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.600
We're gonna get to bring
him home, ain't we?

10:13.700 --> 10:17.800
Meatwad, I think this is gonna have
to be his new home from now on.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.700
Moooo!

10:19.800 --> 10:23.900
See, here he can run and
be free with his own kind.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.000
But...

10:25.000 --> 10:27.200
He's our friend.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.600
Well, yes and no. Come on.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.900
He'll be happier this way.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.500
Goodbye, Shake.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.100
I've never forget you.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.200
Don't look back, Meatwad.
Don't look back.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.700
He's gonna be okay. You'll see.
- No, he ain't.

10:47.300 --> 10:48.800
Ew, what's that ripping noise?

10:48.900 --> 10:51.500
Like someone's just
tearing a nylon tent.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.400
Get in the car.

10:52.400 --> 11:15.000
