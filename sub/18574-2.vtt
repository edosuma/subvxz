WEBVTT

00:01.240 --> 00:02.446
- So...
- So...

00:02.719 --> 00:03.881
What do we do?

00:04.040 --> 00:06.725
Do I have to to sit somewhere?
Are there seatbelts? Like...

00:07.000 --> 00:09.571
What? You've done this before.
This isn't your first trip.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.803
Yeah, but it's proper this time.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.526
Oh, that's a mistake.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.726
What is?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.410
Well, you can't reach the controls
from the seats,

00:17.480 --> 00:19.005
what's the point in that?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.322
Or do you have stretchy arms
like Mr Fantastic?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.846
Oh, I stand. Like this.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.651
You never thought of bringing
the seats a bit closer?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.921
No, not so far, no.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.965
Where's the steering wheel?

00:30.400 --> 00:33.324
Well, you don't steer the TARDIS,

00:34.080 --> 00:35.684
you negotiate with it.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.802
Still point between where you want to go

00:40.880 --> 00:42.291
and where you need to be.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.970
That's where she takes you.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.605
How much did it cost?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.926
Ah.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.361
No idea.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.001
Stole it.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.565
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.331
Why?

00:57.160 --> 00:58.650
Well, actually, because I felt like it.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.846
Oh, what if I steal it from you?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.406
On you go, then.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.400
Well, I don't know how it works.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.211
Oh, neither did I.

01:07.520 --> 01:08.646
Who's that?

01:11.880 --> 01:13.041
Mum.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.684
Excuse me.

01:19.400 --> 01:21.402
Just what is the TARDIS doing down here?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.005
I'm over 2,000 years old.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.570
I don't always want to take the stairs.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.005
Your oath, sir.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.845
You're not supposed to go off-world
unless it's an emergency.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.082
- I'm not off-world.
- Are you going off-world?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.326
I'm going back to my office.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.490
Could you put the kettle on, please?

01:35.840 --> 01:36.841
Mmm.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.280
Why's she here?

01:40.800 --> 01:43.280
Because she isn't anywhere else.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.406
Kettle.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.368
I'm not making any for her.
She can make her own.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.966
Not a slave for a human,
I can assure you.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.201
So...

02:00.840 --> 02:02.046
Back up to your office
for a cuppa, then?

02:04.160 --> 02:05.366
Between here and my office,

02:05.880 --> 02:07.564
before the kettle boils,

02:07.640 --> 02:09.722
is everything that ever happened
or ever will.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.289
- Make your choice.
- What choice?

02:14.720 --> 02:15.960
Past or future.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.281
Future.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.281
Why?

02:23.480 --> 02:25.767
Why do you think?
I want to see if it's happy.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.606
Kezzia, where are you?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.840
Hey, Goodthing. I'm coming back in.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.405
Kezzia, don't come in just yet.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.404
I've been out
since second sunrise.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.686
I'm hungry.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.404
Round them up, big fella.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.403
Kezzia, please don't come in.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.482
We're having a little tiny vard problem.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.088
Me and my vardies have just pollinated
three miles of wheat.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.924
You've got to keep smiling.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.286
Got to what?

03:02.480 --> 03:03.481
It's the vardies.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.244
God, what's wrong with you?

03:05.360 --> 03:07.328
Is that smile supposed to look real?

03:07.400 --> 03:09.209
It's like you're standing
in a wind tunnel.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.241
Hey, big smiles now.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.049
Brace yourself.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.610
Mum is dead.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.126
Sorry?

03:17.200 --> 03:18.201
Smile, smile, smile.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.765
That's not even funny.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.887
No, it's not a joke.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.483
Mum is dead. Mum is dead.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.288
And Hopeful, she's dead, too.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.841
And her friend, Sunshine, she's dead.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.160
And Eliza

03:31.240 --> 03:33.561
and quite a few other people are dead.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.051
Why are you saying this?

03:35.600 --> 03:39.002
You can't say things like that
grinning like an idiot.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.523
Smile, really. Try.
If you don't...

03:43.040 --> 03:45.168
I shouldn't have told you. Please smile.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.967
You're on two tears now.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.290
Is it hugging me?

03:53.080 --> 03:54.605
Who programmed that?

03:54.840 --> 03:56.842
Please, give her a moment.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.562
She'll be happy in a moment.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.644
Kezzia!

04:06.680 --> 04:08.011
No, look.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.645
I'm smiling.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.165
Smiling!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.126
Which way is Earth?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.810
Ah, space is bent.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.007
Earth is any way you choose to look.

05:00.760 --> 05:01.886
Why? You're thinking about leaving?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.001
Thinking? I'm not thinking.
My brain's overloading.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.362
- Why a phone box?
- I told you.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.681
Yeah, well,
I get it's a cloaking device.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.407
But why keep it that shape?
Why do you like it?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.931
Who said I like it?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.968
- You kept it.
- Come along.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.529
This is one
of the Earth's first colonies.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.882
They say the settlers have cracked

05:24.960 --> 05:27.122
the secret of human happiness.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.086
One question.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.971
Little fella said you made an oath?

05:33.520 --> 05:35.045
You're not supposed to leave the planet.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.010
Okay, I suppose
I owe you an explanation.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.842
A long time ago, a thing happened.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.285
As a result of the thing,

05:45.640 --> 05:48.007
I made a promise.
As a result of the promise,

05:48.080 --> 05:49.206
I have to stay on Earth.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.561
Guarding a vault?

05:50.680 --> 05:51.886
Guarding a vault.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.085
Well, you're not guarding
the vault right now.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.323
Yes, I am. I have a time machine.
I can be back before we left.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.607
But what if you get lost,
or stuck or something?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.330
I've thought about that.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.401
And?

06:04.480 --> 06:06.528
Well, it would be a worry,
so best not to dwell on it.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.409
Look at this building, look at it.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.962
You know what I really like
about humanity?

06:11.680 --> 06:12.966
It's optimism.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.605
Do you know
what this building is made of?

06:14.680 --> 06:17.524
Pure, soaring optimism.

06:23.320 --> 06:24.651
What're they?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.125
Alien birds?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.447
Vardies.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.246
Tiny robots.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.490
Work in flocks.
They're versatile, hardworking.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.124
Good at learning skills.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.882
The worker bees
of the third industrial revolution.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.567
Probably just checking us out
for security.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.405
These are robots?
These are disappointing robots.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.885
That's a very offensive remark.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.844
Don't make personal remarks like that.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.125
Er, you can't offend the machine.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.009
Typical, wet-brained chauvinism.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.364
Oh, what just happened?

07:01.440 --> 07:02.566
Your ear's on fire.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.847
Argh, your voice just came out
in my ear.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.209
I mean, I know voices go into ears,
but this is like...

07:08.400 --> 07:10.528
We have been fitted
with some kind of communication device.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.285
It is using our own nervous system
as hardware.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.721
We've just downloaded an upgrade
for our ears.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.086
I'll never lose my phone again.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.208
I'll never run out of battery again!

07:19.360 --> 07:20.771
Welcome to paradise.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.411
Hang on, is there a mute button though?
Like, what if we're in the loo?

07:23.520 --> 07:26.091
Who needs loos?
There's probably an app for that.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.525
So, where is everyone?

07:30.480 --> 07:32.130
Don't tell me
we've come halfway across the universe

07:32.200 --> 07:33.531
and they've all gone out.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.126
Should have texted first or something.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.206
What's that?

07:43.720 --> 07:45.688
That is a robot.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.491
That is not a disappointing robot.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.163
Technically,
this isn't a robot at all.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.287
The tiny little things,
those are the robots.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.129
This is the interface for them.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.326
Does it speak?

07:58.240 --> 07:59.287
Will we understand it?

07:59.440 --> 08:01.920
Well, depends upon
what aspect of your language

08:02.000 --> 08:03.968
has survived
over so many thousands of years.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.083
Emoji! It speaks emoji!

08:07.440 --> 08:08.487
Of course, it does.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.170
Aw, it's cute.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.241
What's that?

08:17.320 --> 08:18.446
Blank patches.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.927
Oh, yours isn't blank.
It's got a face on the back.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.651
Yours too.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.801
Interesting.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.322
It's never on the side
that you're looking at.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.326
What's it doing now? What...
What face is it making?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.004
Mmm, sort of puzzled. Me?

08:38.840 --> 08:40.604
- Same.
- Hmm.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.606
Do you know what I think?

08:42.679 --> 08:46.002
I think that this is some kind
of a mood indicator.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.122
But you're never allowed
to see your own mood?

08:48.480 --> 08:50.005
- Makes sense.
- Does it?

08:50.080 --> 08:52.890
Well, seeing your own mood
might affect your own mood.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.530
It's like a feedback loop,

08:54.960 --> 08:57.486
interfering with
the information being collected.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.843
Like a scale weighing itself.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.965
Well, who's collecting the data?

09:02.560 --> 09:03.721
It's the big question.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.006
So, what do we do, then?

09:05.080 --> 09:06.889
Well, if they're badges, then...

09:09.400 --> 09:10.640
What? Where's...

09:10.720 --> 09:12.370
- Where's it gone?
- Oh, it's on your back.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.567
Oh, yours too.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.967
So, everyone you walk past
can see what you're thinking.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.684
What if you really fancy someone?

09:23.080 --> 09:26.084
Well, I suppose it means that you have
to maintain eye contact with them.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.730
Oh, that's brilliant.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.885
Welcome to the future.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.406
Emojis, verbal communications.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.801
We're in the utopia of vacuous teens.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.445
Look at this!

09:49.520 --> 09:51.010
It knew I was starving.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.248
Food from another planet.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.364
What? You gotta have it in.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.169
Smells like fish.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.051
I'm not that fond of fish.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.240
Except socially,
which can complicate a meal like this.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.806
Should we eat though?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.484
I mean, what if they're not like us?

10:07.560 --> 10:08.846
Well, the cutlery is human cutlery.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.208
No other species
in the universe uses emojis.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.646
Everything here is human.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.081
Except...

10:15.560 --> 10:16.721
No humans.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.007
This is a perfect colony for humans, so,

10:19.120 --> 10:20.770
where are all the colonists?

10:21.600 --> 10:25.286
That's some sort of flavoured algae.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.083
I haven't seen any livestock yet.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.764
That's good, isn't it?

10:30.720 --> 10:33.485
In the future, we don't eat
living things, we eat algae.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.841
I met an emperor made of algae once.

10:38.560 --> 10:39.721
He fancied me.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.611
Why aren't you loving this?

10:45.680 --> 10:47.011
Everything is here.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.682
Everything is ready,
but there's no one here.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.405
It's like the student union
first thing,

10:51.480 --> 10:52.845
before the actual students arrive.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.606
Two portions though.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.043
Well,
that's because that one is mine.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.641
That's it.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.285
That it! Of course!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.409
The whole place is waiting.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.366
We're just too early.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.601
So, who's still in bed?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.289
Two portions. One portion.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.767
Is there going to be food sexism
even in the future?

11:15.160 --> 11:16.446
Is this bloke utopia?

11:16.560 --> 11:19.325
It's probably reading me as two people.
The heartbeats.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.528
If you're going to travel
20 light years,

11:21.600 --> 11:22.840
you're going to want to make sure

11:22.920 --> 11:25.127
that you've got somewhere
to sleep at the end of it, aren't you?

11:25.200 --> 11:26.361
So, what do you do?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.169
Sorry. Two hearts?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.642
You send a rocket load
of intelligent robots up ahead of you.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.802
They build you a place to live,

11:33.880 --> 11:36.087
so that when you arrive,
it's all waiting.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.361
This is brilliant!

11:37.640 --> 11:39.802
You've got two hearts.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.484
Robots, they don't breathe.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.370
They can fix the atmosphere for you,
send data back.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.121
So, you know whether
to bring your waterproofs or not.

11:47.600 --> 11:51.400
Working, huge robot flocks.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.047
You just send them up ahead
and you leave them to it.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.446
Yeah, hearts though, why two?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.641
Oh, why one?

11:59.320 --> 12:01.527
Does that mean
you've got really high blood pressure?

12:02.760 --> 12:03.966
Really high.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.803
So, since people aren't here yet.
What do we do?

12:15.160 --> 12:16.400
Put a kettle on?

12:17.880 --> 12:19.962
Or are we going to leave
before they arrive?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.970
Is that what you're worried about?

12:26.520 --> 12:27.885
I can see you're worried.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.920
Well, you never know
what's around the next corner.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.963
Ah, of course.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.451
Wheat fields outside,

12:39.520 --> 12:41.887
now there's something else to eat
when they get here.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.841
This is their crops.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.522
Look, they're going to have orchards,
olive groves.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.681
This is their nursery.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.411
Look, little robots
are doing pollination work.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.721
Oh, this plant!

12:54.920 --> 12:56.684
There's one of these growing outside
the student union.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.091
It smells amazing.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.207
Rosemary.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.044
I'm smelling home.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.009
Twenty light years from home.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.205
Thanks for bringing me.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.884
This is a great day out.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.644
I mean, come on,

13:15.720 --> 13:17.210
admit it, you love it.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.926
Did I say I didn't love it?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.651
Yes, I do, it's very... Lovable.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.770
You asked me where all the people were.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.128
I theorised that
they hadn't got here yet.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.770
Did I sound convincing?

13:29.800 --> 13:32.246
- Yeah.
- And did I convince myself?

13:33.560 --> 13:34.971
- No.
- No.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.527
No, and I'll tell you why,
because there should be somebody here.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.644
There should be some kind of a...
A set up team.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.644
A skeleton crew.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.446
You're thinking.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.400
Tell me what you're thinking about.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.041
A magic haddock.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.881
Obviously.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.804
What is this stuff? Is it snow?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.010
This is fertiliser.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.086
Mineral fertiliser.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.809
Calcium based. Now.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.647
We don't have answers,
so let's put together two questions.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.007
What is the source of this
mineral fertiliser?

14:15.640 --> 14:16.766
Where are all the people?

14:22.480 --> 14:23.766
Ugh!

14:24.760 --> 14:25.886
Here.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.727
Right here.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.206
In this garden.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.726
Oh, my God.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.161
Despite appearances,
they haven't been dead very long.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.006
What? Those are the colonists?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.251
The colonists aren't here yet.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.766
This is the set up team.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.566
The skeleton crew.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.369
Well, why did the robots feed them
to the garden?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.204
I don't know.
Maybe they ran out of fertiliser.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.361
Let's not ask them.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.088
Hello.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.322
- Er, we were just admiring your garden.
- Yes!

15:09.400 --> 15:12.847
We'll be gone now because there's
nothing of particular interest here.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.921
Cheerio!

15:19.840 --> 15:21.842
If he's chasing us,
he's moving very slowly.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.968
Do you know what it means
if something chases you very slowly?

15:24.040 --> 15:25.166
- What?
- It means,

15:25.240 --> 15:27.083
there's a reason
that they don't have to run.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.850
Okay, they're slow
but the city's full of 'em.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.921
So they catch you in the end.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.286
And what do we do?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.647
The question. We've been here for ages.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.926
Why are they taking us now?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.081
Does it matter?

15:45.160 --> 15:46.241
Only if we want to live.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.647
Smile for me.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.761
Smile?

15:51.760 --> 15:53.762
Use your whole face. Right now. Do it.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.210
Er, what good's smiling?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.890
Smiles aren't just smiles.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.408
Psychologically, they have
a measurable effect on your mood states.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.001
Yes!

16:04.240 --> 16:07.608
These robots, they built this place,
they grew those trees.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.726
Something went wrong, but they were
designed to make you happy.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.366
How would massacring hundreds of people
make me happy?

16:13.480 --> 16:16.768
"How would massacring hundreds of people
make me happy?" Smiley face.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.321
Smiley face.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.601
Magic haddock.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.967
What magic haddock?
What's that all about?

16:23.240 --> 16:25.766
The robots want you to be happy
but they got the wrong end of the stick.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.650
I think we should give them
what they want.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.925
Don't even try without smiling.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.927
What a lovely place you have here!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.321
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.086
We will come again.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.170
Doctor, I... I was thinking, maybe
next time we might go to Wiltshire,

16:53.240 --> 16:54.366
perhaps.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.805
Or Aberdeen.

16:56.360 --> 17:03.164
Ah, yes. Two thumbs up
for Wiltshire/Aberdeen.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.284
- Doctor!
- Smile!

17:15.359 --> 17:17.044
Smile!

17:22.319 --> 17:23.685
Where did they come from?

17:23.760 --> 17:26.127
Once we're out of the city,
we should be safe.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.606
Are they coming after us?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.404
I'm guessing that once we're out,
we're not their problem.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.847
Right. You'll be perfectly safe
in the TARDIS.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.649
She'll look after you till I get back.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.767
Where are you going?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.766
There's a giant smiley abattoir
over there.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.207
And I'm having this
really childish impulse to blow it up!

18:01.280 --> 18:02.361
Be right back.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.408
What, you're going back in?
We've only just escaped.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.966
I thought we were going home.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.961
Home?

18:10.640 --> 18:12.244
Why would we be going home?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.243
That place is a living death trap.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.845
We can't just leave it
with its mouth wide open.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.410
But they're all dead.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.970
We saw them, it's too late.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.930
We have to assume
that there is a colony ship on the way.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.082
What do you think is gonna happen
when all those people arrive?

18:24.280 --> 18:26.169
They're expecting
the new Garden of Eden.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.891
What they are not expecting
is to be the fertiliser.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.924
There's broadband in there.
Go and watch some movies or something.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.645
Well, I get that
someone has to do something,

18:34.720 --> 18:35.926
but why is it you?

18:36.400 --> 18:37.890
Can't you phone the police?

18:38.480 --> 18:40.209
Isn't there a helpline or something?

18:41.080 --> 18:43.481
And stay away from my browser history!

18:57.360 --> 18:59.124
A penguin with his arse on fire.

19:17.960 --> 19:18.961
Huh.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.961
Ah.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.200
Good morning.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.047
I'm happy.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.328
Good morning. Look at me. I'm...
I'm happy. happy. happy. happy...

19:39.520 --> 19:42.569
What a lovely, beautiful morning.
It makes me so happy.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.162
I'm happy,
I hope that you are happy too.

19:48.640 --> 19:49.641
See?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.201
Happy.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.722
Hello, is someone there?

20:16.680 --> 20:17.761
I can hear you breathing.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.406
Why are you Scottish?

20:21.080 --> 20:22.969
I'm not Scottish. I'm just cross.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.451
Is there a Scotland in space?

20:24.560 --> 20:25.527
They are all over the place.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.449
Demanding independence from every planet
that they land on.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.601
Why are you here?

20:28.680 --> 20:31.160
Because I figured out why you keep
your box as a phone box.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.321
I told you, it's stuck.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.926
"Advice and assistance
obtainable immediately."

20:35.040 --> 20:36.530
- You like that.
- No, I don't.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.330
See, this is the point.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.810
You don't call the helpline
because you are the helpline.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.126
Don't sentimentalise me.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.248
I don't just fly around
helping people out.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.681
What are you doing right now?

20:48.560 --> 20:51.131
I happened to be passing by
so I'm mucking in.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.725
You never passed by in your life.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.850
You couldn't even leave me
serving chips.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.445
So, I'm not gonna leave you.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.001
Look at the wall.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.441
- The wall?
- Closely.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.761
Before, when the vardi, the little
microbots, were going to attack you,

21:10.080 --> 21:11.525
you asked me where they came from.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.966
Well, they didn't come from anywhere.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.170
They were here all the time.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.849
In the wall?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.608
No. Not in the wall.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.931
They're not in the wall.
They are the wall.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.525
They' re all the walls.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.326
These little robots
didn't build this place.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.447
They became it.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.000
They can be a part of a wall
one minute, flying around the next.

21:39.080 --> 21:43.881
This whole structure is built
from interlocking microbots.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.690
Smile. You're in the belly of the beast.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.366
So what do we do?

21:53.560 --> 21:55.403
Well, the obvious. We find a real wall.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.490
Oh, you really are smiling, aren't you?

21:58.600 --> 21:59.965
Do you know why?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.048
You're an awesome tutor.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.446
When the Vikings invaded, they used to
pull the longboats out of the water,

22:09.520 --> 22:10.601
turn them upside down

22:11.080 --> 22:12.491
and live in them as houses

22:12.560 --> 22:15.211
until they pillaged and looted enough
to build new ones.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.521
So?

22:17.600 --> 22:19.443
You didn't see
a spaceship outside, did you?

22:20.000 --> 22:22.048
When the settlers first landed,
they must have lived in it

22:22.120 --> 22:24.088
and built out from it,

22:24.920 --> 22:26.046
so it's still here.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.484
Somewhere inside this building.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.605
Ah...

22:34.880 --> 22:36.211
Bits of meteor damage.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.687
Flakes of rust. Rivets.
Oh, I love rivets.

22:38.760 --> 22:43.288
A wall. A real, honest wall. Not made of
tiny robots but made of any old iron.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.842
Every spacecraft needs... A door!

22:56.160 --> 22:57.207
Not even locked.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.084
They were expecting to live in peace.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.761
Wicked.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.649
We'll lock it after us, shall we?

23:30.280 --> 23:31.930
It's life support systems
are starting up.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.286
It knows we're here.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.124
Whoever did
the interior decoration in here

23:36.200 --> 23:38.202
needs to take lessons
from whoever did the out there.

23:38.280 --> 23:41.489
Ah. This was built by humans.
That was built by vardi.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.369
Wet brains, dry brains.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.921
Ah...

24:00.960 --> 24:04.442
Good old, universally-compatible

24:04.520 --> 24:08.320
incorruptible maps.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.401
You are here.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.686
This is the engine room.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.407
That's the target.
That's where I'm going.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.329
- Where am I going?
- You are staying here.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.847
And you will be guiding me to here
using this map.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.843
I'll hear you through the thingamabob.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.291
I'm on a spaceship.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.321
Like, for real.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.887
A proper one.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.800
- Left or right?
- Oh! Er...

24:41.280 --> 24:42.281
Right.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.162
Well, they were certainly planning
to make themselves at home here.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.811
They brought
all their favourite knick-knacks.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.567
Er, there should be a door
that leads on to a corridor.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.243
- I really am on a spaceship.
- Yes...

24:58.760 --> 25:00.922
Which we are about to blow up.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.166
How are you allowed to do that?

25:02.920 --> 25:06.561
Like, how are you allowed to blow
something up and not get into trouble.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.802
I mean, blow something up,
get into trouble.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.281
That is a standard sequence.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.490
What do you mean "allowed"?
It's a moral imperative.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.205
This is a murder machine.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.371
Beautiful though.
I mean, the whole place.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.170
Er, you should be able
to see a staircase.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.522
All traps are beautiful.
That's how they work.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.764
- Up or down?
- Down.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.762
What... What's this big bit
in the middle?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.362
There's a big, empty space
in the middle.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.043
The engine is in the middle
of a big, empty space.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.481
What's that for?

25:40.640 --> 25:41.766
Attention.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.123
Attention. Error one systems initiated

25:45.200 --> 25:47.965
Ship's system's set to respond
to human presence.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.567
It was sleeping. We walked in.
Now it's waking up.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.083
- Er, there should be a ladder.
- Got it.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.201
Pitiful.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.970
Fleischman cold fusion engine.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.761
All I got to do is back the flow
into the calorimeter and run.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.008
It's like
it wants to get blown up.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.009
Hang on, I'm being thick.
I can come with you.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.761
Took that long
to think of photographing it?

26:38.840 --> 26:40.365
You'd already memorised it, hadn't you?

26:40.440 --> 26:43.046
- Yep.
- Stop trying to keep me out of trouble.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.602
There's no trouble.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.042
This is going to be
a stroll in the park.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.521
Doctor, why did people come here?

28:27.680 --> 28:29.250
Did something terrible happen?

28:29.600 --> 28:30.726
I can't hear you.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.961
Oh! Argh!

28:36.800 --> 28:39.690
- This isn't as easy as it looks.
- I've got to know.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.925
The people who came here.
Were they the last people?

28:44.720 --> 28:46.643
Were they our last hope?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.803
Earth was evacuated.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.848
But there were a number of ships.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.321
I've bumped into a few of them
over the years.

29:00.600 --> 29:04.446
Right. I've rerouted the flow.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.761
No.No.No.No.No.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.285
That's not right. Bad noise.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.727
That's not right... No. No! Er...

29:18.520 --> 29:20.807
No. When the calorimeter
reaches its peak...

29:20.880 --> 29:22.530
I could do with a hand here!

29:22.600 --> 29:24.284
Okay. On my way.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.567
Oh.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.206
Are we there yet?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.927
Doctor,
there's something you need to know.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.731
I'm too busy!

29:49.480 --> 29:50.527
Oh!

30:01.000 --> 30:02.684
Almost with you, Doctor.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.963
You took your time.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.089
When I let this go,

30:07.200 --> 30:08.565
it's gonna spin back.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.407
I want you to hold it tight

30:13.480 --> 30:15.130
while I jam it shut.

30:25.160 --> 30:27.561
Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me?

30:27.680 --> 30:30.160
Oh, don't worry about me.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.164
I'm having the time of my life

30:32.280 --> 30:34.248
making new friends!

30:34.560 --> 30:35.607
Come on.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.804
Get ready to run. Run really fast!

30:54.360 --> 30:55.441
What?

30:56.760 --> 30:57.886
Where did you come from?

30:58.000 --> 30:59.365
Where is everybody?

31:00.720 --> 31:02.848
When you say everybody...

31:03.360 --> 31:05.203
My very good people.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.602
We will soon be beginning
an emergency disembarkation.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.923
Good people,
please prepare for disembarkation.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.801
We wish you a happy new world.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.081
Doctor?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.841
Pods.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.171
Pods.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.844
What is it? What's happening?

31:24.480 --> 31:26.164
We can't blow up the city.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.247
Why?

31:30.360 --> 31:32.249
Those pods, what's in them?

31:32.320 --> 31:33.606
I got it wrong.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.485
I got it very, very wrong.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.169
The colony ship isn't on the way.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.641
It's right here.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.043
The colonists are all around us.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.281
Cryogenically frozen.

31:48.360 --> 31:53.048
What's in those pods, Bill,
is the surviving population

31:53.120 --> 31:54.246
of Earth.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.724
And! nearly killed all of them.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.567
Welcome to your new world.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.766
Be happy.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.125
They're waking up, aren't they?

32:05.240 --> 32:07.208
We must've triggered the process
when we came in.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.651
So what happens now?

32:12.640 --> 32:13.926
Now?

32:15.720 --> 32:17.722
Now they're all gonna leave the ship

32:17.800 --> 32:20.451
and find their friends and family
mulched in the garden.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.489
And did Earth smile about that?

32:26.360 --> 32:28.408
It's going to be the end
of the human race.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.124
Argh. Oh, those pods, eh?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.486
Not much headroom.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.403
Oh. Thought I'd be first up.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.965
Steadfast. I'm at Tech one.

32:49.080 --> 32:51.526
- What day is this?
- The end of the world.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.648
Again? We've only just got here.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.000
Bill, with me.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.161
What's happening?

32:58.800 --> 33:02.043
What's happening is nobody leaves
this ship until I tell you otherwise.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.811
Clear? Nobody leaves.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.325
- Where are we going?
- No idea.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.243
But if I look purposeful,
they'll think I've got a plan.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.566
If they think I've got a plan,

33:11.640 --> 33:14.007
at least they won't try to
think of a plan themselves.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.809
But you don't have a plan?

33:15.880 --> 33:18.008
I don't know how to stop it
happening again.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.162
Because I can't figure out
why it happened last time.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.765
What made them do this?

33:22.520 --> 33:24.284
I think I need to show you something.

33:26.040 --> 33:30.011
Section A-34,
reanimation sequence commencing.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.320
Spacecraft landed.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.920
Most of the colonists were
kept in cryogenic suspension.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.209
A few, the ones with skills...

33:40.280 --> 33:42.089
The best ones. The brave ones.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.810
They were woken

33:45.280 --> 33:47.806
to shepherd the little flocks
of vardi robots.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.006
She came here. She was happy.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.131
It was all going well.

33:56.480 --> 33:57.970
Those are the shepherds, aren't they?

33:59.240 --> 34:00.480
And they're all dead.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.522
If we rearrange this data

34:05.000 --> 34:07.082
to reflect the time of death,
what do we get?

34:13.239 --> 34:14.241
That's her.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.280
This woman died.
There's no sign of violence.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.487
So you know, she just died
the way that humans do.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.406
Then a few more people died

34:28.159 --> 34:32.130
all at the same time and then
a lot more died just after.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.971
And then the rest.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.246
Dozens.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.128
A virus? A virus that went...

34:40.040 --> 34:41.201
Well, viral?

34:41.840 --> 34:43.683
Grief! Grief!

34:43.840 --> 34:45.409
Grief as plague.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.481
How?

34:47.000 --> 34:50.686
The vardies, well, their job
was to maintain happiness.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.969
At first that meant making sure
there was enough oxygen and water.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.690
That's what the badges
are meant to communicate.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.560
Satisfaction.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.449
A positive mental state.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.009
But the vardi are smart.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.721
They learn.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.730
Try to be good servants.

35:07.320 --> 35:12.008
So they expand the definition
of happiness until...

35:12.800 --> 35:13.961
She dies.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.489
No one had ever died here
before this lady.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.086
The vardies, they've never
heard of grief before.

35:21.960 --> 35:26.443
This place is all about hope
and the future and happiness.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.010
No one ever thought about the opposite.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.242
The vardies didn't know
what to do with it.

35:31.960 --> 35:36.568
They identified grief
as the enemy of happiness

35:36.640 --> 35:40.201
and everyone who was experiencing grief

35:40.280 --> 35:41.611
as a problem,

35:41.680 --> 35:43.091
- as...
- Compost.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.491
And all those dead people,

35:44.560 --> 35:46.528
well, you know, they had friends
and family, too, so...

35:46.600 --> 35:47.931
Even more compost.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.048
And so on, and so on and so on

35:50.160 --> 35:53.369
and what you get
is a whole, like, a grief tsunami.

35:53.440 --> 35:54.930
And all this took how long?

35:55.160 --> 35:56.400
One morning.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.648
All of these people
were slaughtered in a day.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.051
Slaughtered for their own good.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.924
Because the vardi think different.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.764
Like the magic haddock.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.286
Not bad, not good, just different.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.085
So what will happen when
the new people meet the robots?

36:21.520 --> 36:22.681
That's the boy.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.483
The first to wake up.
Where did you get this?

36:25.560 --> 36:27.164
I think it's his mother's, don't you?

36:27.240 --> 36:28.321
Yeah, or his nan's.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.002
Well, you'll find her.
When she wakes up in her pod.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.565
I found it in the fruit garden
when we first arrived.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.801
Oh.

36:38.920 --> 36:43.005
I would say that a lot of the colonists
had friends or family

36:43.280 --> 36:44.930
who were working here as shepherds.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.331
When they find out what happened...

36:46.400 --> 36:48.562
They'll be grief-stricken.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.601
And after that?

36:51.120 --> 36:52.451
A massacre.

36:57.200 --> 36:58.531
Okay, where are we going?

36:58.600 --> 36:59.965
What's the opposite of a massacre?

37:01.040 --> 37:03.771
- Okay, what?
- In my experience a lecture.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.043
You brought the vardi here.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.327
Microbots to make your life so easy.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.880
But like every slave class in history,

37:22.960 --> 37:25.850
the vardi are beginning to have
ideas of their own.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.202
They wanted to eliminate unhappiness

37:29.280 --> 37:32.921
but to a robot that meant
eliminating unhappy people-

37:33.440 --> 37:35.522
They gave you monitors badges,

37:35.760 --> 37:38.570
so they'd know when you were
too unhappy to live.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.282
- You need to listen.
- I did listen.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.290
What did I miss?
The vardi have killed our families.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.771
But you need to understand
why that happened.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.966
I don't care why.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.361
Then you will die, too,
and so will everyone on your ship.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.761
- The vardi are not your enemy.
- They want to kill us.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.365
No, they want to help you.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.329
- Killing you is just the side effect.
- Get out of my way.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.329
You've got guns. You think that'll
help you against the whole living city?

38:10.760 --> 38:13.081
That little boy, where did he go?

38:13.680 --> 38:15.091
My mum was a gardener.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.446
Have you seen her?

38:20.720 --> 38:22.245
She's supposed to be here.

38:32.440 --> 38:33.566
There he is.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.411
Step away from the kid.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.970
They're not armed.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.281
You don't need to do this.
You just need to...

38:39.360 --> 38:40.361
What's wrong?

38:41.400 --> 38:42.890
What's going on? Where's my mum?

38:43.800 --> 38:44.926
Where's everyone?

38:47.960 --> 38:50.042
- Where's everyone?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.121
Don't cry. Don't cry.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.561
Hey, hey...

38:53.000 --> 38:54.570
Look, everything's gonna be okay.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.404
Look.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.528
This is your new house. Isn't it lovely?

38:58.600 --> 38:59.681
I want Mummy.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.569
Okay. Smile, smile, smile, smile.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.044
Everything's gonna be fine
if you just keep smiling.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.485
Get away from the kid!

39:13.680 --> 39:15.648
What's that?

39:16.200 --> 39:18.089
Rage? Revenge?

39:18.240 --> 39:19.526
It's one robot.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.965
It's not one robot.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.251
Doctor, what do we do?

39:25.640 --> 39:26.801
Doctor, what's happening?

39:27.600 --> 39:28.601
Cover fire! Now!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.843
- It's fascinating.
- What's fascinating?

39:34.920 --> 39:36.968
The vardi are identifying as
under attack.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.849
Which means they identify as a species.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.724
They are self-aware. They...

39:41.800 --> 39:42.847
They're alive!

39:43.320 --> 39:44.446
They're going to kill us.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.768
- What are you doing?
- I really hope this doesn't hurt.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.882
Do you know why I always win at chess?

39:54.560 --> 39:56.085
Because I have a secret move.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.641
I kick over the board.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.521
Here it comes.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.406
Once, long ago

40:09.480 --> 40:12.086
a fisherman caught a magic haddock.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.051
The haddock offered the fisherman
three wishes in return for his life.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.371
The fisherman said,

40:18.440 --> 40:20.966
"I'd like my son to come home
from the war"

40:21.040 --> 40:22.963
"and 100 pieces of gold."

40:23.600 --> 40:27.844
The problem is magic haddock,
like robots,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.570
don't think like people.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.401
The fisherman's son came home
from the war in a coffin.

40:33.800 --> 40:38.203
The king sent 100 gold pieces
in recognition of his heroic death.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.930
The fisherman had one wish left.
What do you think he wished for?

40:43.560 --> 40:46.928
Some people say he should've wished
for an infinite series of wishes.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.287
But if your city proves anything,

40:49.360 --> 40:52.569
it is that granting all your wishes
is not a good idea.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.369
It's okay.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.285
It's not gonna hurt you.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.330
Actually, he doesn't even know
who you are.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.289
What happened? What have you done?

41:00.360 --> 41:04.570
In fact, the fisherman wished that
he hadn't wished the first two wishes.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.722
Thus, in a way,
pressed the reset button.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.680
What the hell did you do?

41:10.160 --> 41:11.525
Aren't you listening?

41:11.960 --> 41:13.450
I pressed the reset button.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.486
Every computer has one
and anyone can find it.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.281
Especially if they happen to be
a scary, handsome, genius from space.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.567
I re-initialised the entire
command structure

41:23.120 --> 41:25.088
retaining all programmed abilities

41:25.160 --> 41:28.243
but deleting the supplementary
preference architecture.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.087
He turned it off and on again.

41:30.160 --> 41:31.889
I turned it off and on again.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.485
Course, I wiped their memories.

41:38.680 --> 41:41.331
They no longer have the faintest idea
who you are.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.643
And, in fact, they're wondering what
you're doing in their very nice city.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.727
Their city?

41:47.400 --> 41:48.401
Yes.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.201
Their city.

41:50.760 --> 41:51.761
It's made of them.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.205
- It's our city.
- Oh.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.408
- They're our robots.
- They were.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.086
Welcome to your new world.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.086
Meet the vardi.

41:59.840 --> 42:03.049
They are as of now
the indigenous life form.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.485
You'd best make friends with them

42:04.560 --> 42:06.642
because there's loads of them.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.041
And they're the only ones who know
how anything works.

42:10.400 --> 42:11.401
They killed our people.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.281
Well, look.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.522
They have forgotten about that.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.769
They've forgotten about you.

42:21.080 --> 42:24.448
They've forgotten that you even
made them in the first place.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.451
Now, since they have absolute power
over this city

42:27.520 --> 42:31.525
and since, I'm assuming, you all
don't want to sleep rough tonight,

42:31.600 --> 42:32.681
I have a suggestion for you.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.081
Smile.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.805
You can't be serious.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.610
I am serious.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.489
In fact, I'm willing to be a negotiator.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.085
- Are you now?
- Yes.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.166
Watch.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.162
Hello, I'm the Doctor.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.841
A few hours ago, I made the mistake
of not recognising your status

42:56.000 --> 42:58.207
as an emergent new life-form.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.763
As recompense for my mistake, please
allow me to act as your negotiator

43:02.840 --> 43:06.049
with the migratory conglomerate
known as the human race.

43:06.120 --> 43:09.090
They're looking for a place to stay
and they've got their eye on your city.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.645
Would you like me to discuss rent?

43:19.560 --> 43:21.324
$0, is it gonna work?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.726
That's up to them.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.160
Did you just...

43:28.840 --> 43:31.047
Well, did we just

43:32.480 --> 43:34.084
jumpstart a new civilisation?

43:34.240 --> 43:36.049
It's a dirty job,
but someone's gotta do it.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.566
Did you do this all the time?

43:37.640 --> 43:38.721
Do what?

43:38.800 --> 43:40.609
Flying around sorting things out like
some kind of

43:40.680 --> 43:42.284
intergalactic policeman?

43:42.360 --> 43:44.886
I don't sort things out.
I'm definitely not a policeman.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.050
Well, you live in a police box.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.171
- It's a pure coincidence.
- Yeah, of course.

43:54.640 --> 43:57.120
Back at the exact moment we left.

43:58.200 --> 44:02.000
Kettle's boiling, and with
a vote to God,

44:02.080 --> 44:05.926
and everything is exactly as we left it.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.485
Wasn't snowing when we left.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.203
Maybe I do need a steering wheel.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.761
- Where are we?
- London.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.930
And this is

44:28.960 --> 44:29.961
the Thames.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.609
Travel into the past,
there's got to be rules.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.967
If I step on a butterfly,
it could send ripples through time.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.769
Yeah!

44:46.840 --> 44:49.571
Regency England. Bit more black
than they show in the movies.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.444
Are there any side effects
to time travel?

44:52.200 --> 44:54.771
Sometimes you see lights under the ice.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.841
Stay back!

44:55.920 --> 44:58.082
There's something frozen
under the Thames and it's eating people.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.491
Plan, let's get eaten.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.249
The creature will be fed.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.731
Have you ever killed anyone?
