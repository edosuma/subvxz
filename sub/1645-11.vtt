00:00.826 --> 00:02.654
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.698 --> 00:04.091
The bracing is going
to be tricky.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.744
Unless the tunnel
gets the proper support,

00:05.788 --> 00:07.442
it's all going
to come down on our heads.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.705
LINCOLN:
Listen, I want you
to call her up,

00:09.748 --> 00:11.663
tell her you've got
some information.

00:11.707 --> 00:15.711
Make sure she picks you up,
and get in the car, all right?

00:15.754 --> 00:18.583
He even bought a gun.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.715
Just thought
you'd want to know.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.021
If you're really leaving,

00:21.064 --> 00:23.632
take me with you.
Please.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.590
I don't want to be here anymore.

00:25.634 --> 00:28.550
You don't want any part of this.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.728
There's a part of me
that doesn't want

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
to believe he works for them,

00:34.121 --> 00:35.774
'cause he's
the man I love;

00:35.818 --> 00:37.994
the man who was going to take me
to my first trip to Paris.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.301
If he doesn't take you, I will.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.741
Impressive, blanco.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.699
Too bad you won't be around
to enjoy it.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.663
LECHERO:
How long is this
going to set us back?

00:59.668 --> 01:01.452
All right, we got 24 hours
to dig out that tunnel.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.324
You mean the one
it took you guys three days

01:03.367 --> 01:04.629
to dig the first time?

01:04.673 --> 01:05.848
Let's just say,
by some miracle,

01:05.891 --> 01:07.850
we are able
to part the dirt sea, Moses.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.591
Then what?

01:09.634 --> 01:11.245
How you plan on getting
around the guards' tower?

01:11.288 --> 01:14.509
MAHONE:
Michael, Mr. Whistler
here says that,

01:14.552 --> 01:16.380
you know, you got stopped
last time by a cloud.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.816
I'm still working on that.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.298
I'd like to know
if this girl's gonna put out

01:21.342 --> 01:22.821
before I spend
any more time buying her drinks!

01:22.865 --> 01:24.214
WHISTLER:
I agree, Michael.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.781
You know as well as I do
what's riding on this.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.696
I'd say I know better.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.132
I don't care
who knows what

01:29.176 --> 01:31.917
so long as somebody knows
how the hell we getting

01:31.961 --> 01:34.268
out of here by tomorrow.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.841
LINCOLN:
You coming?

01:42.885 --> 01:44.452
SOFIA:
Not today.

01:44.495 --> 01:48.543
James and I have
a lot of things to clear up,

01:48.586 --> 01:51.415
but I'm done trying to do it
through a fence.

01:51.459 --> 01:54.549
You ever wish you
could go back in time?

01:54.592 --> 01:58.988
Just to remember how it
was like when things made sense?

01:59.031 --> 02:02.861
Every day for the
last three years.

02:15.874 --> 02:19.182
Is that Whistler's girlfriend?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.141
Why is she staying in the car?

02:21.184 --> 02:22.838
Guess she thinks
she'll see him tomorrow.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.188
You've been spending
a lot of time together, huh?

02:25.232 --> 02:26.798
And?You sure that's wise?

02:26.842 --> 02:28.409
Where are we?

02:28.452 --> 02:30.846
Behind schedule.
But we should be on the same

02:30.889 --> 02:32.413
side of the fence
by tomorrow afternoon.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.197
What do you
mean, "should"?The tunnel gets us

02:34.241 --> 02:36.678
into no-man's-land,
but to get to the fence,

02:36.721 --> 02:39.768
we're going to need a new
diversion for the tower guards.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.683
What time?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.685
Daytime's still our best option.

02:43.728 --> 02:44.773
They double the guards at night.

02:44.816 --> 02:45.904
And the jeep patrols?

02:45.948 --> 02:49.256
Yeah. And, uh...
there's something else.

02:49.299 --> 02:50.692
What?

02:50.735 --> 02:53.216
T-Bag's coming. And Mahone.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.784
And Bellick. Oh, yeah,
there's a drug lord, too.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.525
You know what?
It's not about them.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.656
It's about Whistler.
We got to do whatever...

02:58.700 --> 02:59.918
You don't need to know
who Whistler is.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.617
What about what he's worth?
My son's life.

03:02.660 --> 03:07.230
I just wish there
was another way to do this.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.407
To save LJ
without handing Whistler over.

03:10.451 --> 03:13.105
Look, man, that's it.
There isn't.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.977
I know.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.153
Listen, you worry
about the tunnel,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.241
I worry about the guards.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.852
See you tomorrow.Tomorrow.

03:27.772 --> 03:31.036
BELLICK:
Hey, now, don't skimp
on the braces up there.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.169
In fact, if you want to add
a little extra, just...

03:33.213 --> 03:35.302
You know, we can work
on this railroad all...

03:35.345 --> 03:37.391
the livelong day,
but it don't matter

03:37.434 --> 03:40.132
if Scofield doesn't know
what happens once

03:40.176 --> 03:41.438
we get off the train.Once we get

03:41.482 --> 03:43.179
out of here,
it's every man for himself.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.789
Scofield's not responsible
for any of us.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.356
Is that so?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.271
You obviously don't
know him very well,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.186
Shakespeare.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.275
When we broke out of Fox River,

03:52.319 --> 03:54.277
he tried to screw
every one of us.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.540
Half the men
ended up either

03:56.584 --> 03:58.803
dead, captured or worse.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.718
The guys who are
easiest to catch

04:00.762 --> 04:02.198
are the ones
who spend more time

04:02.242 --> 04:05.245
pissing and moaning at
each other than running.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.857
My only advice to you,

04:08.900 --> 04:11.163
Ecclesiastes 6:13.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.644
"Separate thyself
from thy enemies,

04:13.688 --> 04:15.864
and take heed of thy friends."

04:15.907 --> 04:17.996
How we doing, Alex?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.998
Well, if those braces hold,

04:20.042 --> 04:22.871
we could be
to the surface

04:22.914 --> 04:24.133
sometime tomorrow.

04:24.176 --> 04:27.092
Let's rotate.
Keep everybody fresh.

04:27.136 --> 04:30.705
Welcome to
the coal mine, canary.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.372
[Mahone grunts with effort]Givin' 'em the old 'ay!

04:51.900 --> 04:53.641
Cho!

04:53.684 --> 04:56.296
Don't drop your body-water
upon me like that!

04:56.339 --> 04:58.907
Hey, it ain't coming from me,
I swear.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.952
Engineer, come.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.390
Look at this.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.959
We hit a pipe
or something?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.700
Oh, no.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.848
That's right above our tunnel.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.112
That's not going
to hold till tomorrow.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.680
So what do we do?

05:32.723 --> 05:34.812
We leave tonight.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.369
[thunder rumbling]

06:09.412 --> 06:10.892
Tonight?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.372
I thought you said a nighttime
escape was impossible.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.896
If the rain keeps up,
the tunnel will collapse again,

06:14.939 --> 06:16.114
and that'll be the end of it.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.768
It'll be the
end for you.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.553
You're the one on a deadline.

06:19.596 --> 06:20.945
What if it gives out
while we're inside?

06:20.989 --> 06:21.946
We end up
like buried treasure.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.818
You want out, get out!

06:26.647 --> 06:27.952
Look, you're not
pulling this off tonight

06:27.996 --> 06:30.172
without all of us
working around the clock.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.479
And none of us

06:32.522 --> 06:34.045
are ever making it
out of here

06:34.089 --> 06:35.699
without his plan,
so if you tell me

06:35.743 --> 06:39.007
that you can figure out a way
how to do this at night,

06:39.050 --> 06:41.009
then I-- we--
can figure out a way

06:41.052 --> 06:42.489
how to get that tunnel
dug in time.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.669
Let's start digging.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.805
[rain pouring, thunder rumbling]

06:58.505 --> 07:00.985
I think you dropped something.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.813
I've read in old newspapers
that make it to Sona

07:02.857 --> 07:07.122
how Americans hold others
to standards they ignore.

07:07.165 --> 07:10.473
How they think no one
should have power but them.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.695
I tell everyone it's a lie,
but I see it's true.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.175
I know you're leaving.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.701
And I think that after
everything I've done to help,

07:20.744 --> 07:24.139
I think it sucks
you're not taking me with you!

07:24.182 --> 07:26.576
I know it doesn't
seem like it now,

07:26.620 --> 07:29.013
but I'm doing you a favor;
I'm giving you a gift.

07:29.057 --> 07:31.059
Oh, wow, life in prison.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.235
Thank you.
I've always wanted one of those.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.628
It's better
than a life on the run.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.631
I don't belong here.
All I did was give a guy...

07:37.674 --> 07:38.849
You're not going!

07:40.285 --> 07:42.200
I'm sorry.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.246
It's for the best.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.943
How do you know
what's best for me?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.080
Y cuanto me va costar?

07:52.123 --> 07:54.038
Okay, muchas gracias.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.475
It's good to go.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.651
You know where and
when to be, right?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.566
If you're not there,
we're screwed.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.571
You all right?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.137
I'm fine.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.531
I'm just going to grab my stuff.

08:08.575 --> 08:12.274
Yeah. Probably best
if you and James disappear.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.972
I know. I know.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.583
You know where to meet us,
right?

08:16.626 --> 08:20.804
Playa Blanca.
You'll be on the...

08:20.848 --> 08:22.066
312.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.940
312.
We'll see you tomorrow then.

08:25.983 --> 08:26.941
Good luck.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.203
You, too.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.205
[phone rings]Hey, it's that Susan chick.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.598
She wants to meet again.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.208
Good.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.644
Let her know
everything's on track.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.777
We want to make her feel
as comfortable as possible.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.256
Why shouldn't she be?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.693
She's going to get her guy
tomorrow, right?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.913
Well, if Michael's conscience
doesn't get in the way.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.742
What do you mean?

08:45.786 --> 08:47.352
He's having doubts.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.789
About if he can pull it off?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.573
About if he should.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.662
But he's going
to go through with it, right?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.372
What are you looking for?

09:07.416 --> 09:10.898
Where the power lines connect
to Sona's exterior lights.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.769
If cutting the power
out there was an option,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.336
why didn't we do that
in the first place?

09:14.379 --> 09:17.339
One, the power out there
isn't controlled from in here.

09:17.382 --> 09:20.342
And, two, there's that.

09:20.385 --> 09:23.258
Every prison
has a backup generator.

09:23.301 --> 09:26.217
Even if we cut the lights,
they'll just come back on again

09:26.261 --> 09:28.568
immediately.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.091
Well, that's a big,
bloody problem.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.659
Tell Lechero
I need his phone.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.185
MICHAEL:
Change of plans, Linc.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.534
We're doing this tonight.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.363
Tonight? What happened, Michael?

09:41.406 --> 09:43.147
Rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.148
How long can it hold?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.802
That depends.

09:45.846 --> 09:46.890
Depends on what?

09:48.457 --> 09:50.633
When the rain stops.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.680
You said breaking out at night
was impossible.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.203
Yeah, well...

09:55.246 --> 09:57.031
So you want to tell me how
you're gonna pull this off?

09:57.074 --> 10:00.251
For starters,
I need to get ahold of Sucre.

10:00.295 --> 10:04.081
[Spanish pop song playing]

10:10.610 --> 10:15.440
Sucre, do you know
what I do for a living?

10:15.484 --> 10:17.704
I have a pretty good idea.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.444
I read people.

10:19.488 --> 10:23.100
And you, my friend,
are a coloring book.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.234
I think you left

10:26.277 --> 10:27.975
this in my car.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.760
Look. That... that was just...
I mean...

10:30.804 --> 10:32.675
No. No, no, no, no.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.242
My fault.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.984
I guess I just didn't
make myself clear

10:37.027 --> 10:39.682
when I laid out the terms
of our arrangement.

10:39.726 --> 10:43.425
So I'm going to try again,
as simply as I know how.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.774
Anything happens--

10:44.818 --> 10:48.169
anything at all
that I wasn't expecting--

10:48.212 --> 10:49.692
and there will be one less

10:49.736 --> 10:51.172
pregnant girl
in Chicago.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.435
Look, Michael and Lincoln
don't tell me everything.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.350
Fernando,
this is your last chance.

10:55.393 --> 10:56.917
I want a yes or a no.

10:56.960 --> 11:01.008
Are the brothers gonna break
Whistler out of Sona?

11:01.051 --> 11:02.618
Yes.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.751
Are they planning
on handing him over to me?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.710
Yes.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.627
Where do you want me
to shoot Maricruz first,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.717
in the bun
or in the oven?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.153
Okay!

11:21.028 --> 11:24.205
There's one thing I heard.

11:24.248 --> 11:28.383
It's Michael. He's, he's having
some concerns about Whistler.

11:28.426 --> 11:30.428
What kind of concerns?

11:30.472 --> 11:32.953
About handing him over.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.173
You got to understand,

11:36.217 --> 11:38.785
he broke out
some pretty bad guys last time.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.266
I think he's never forgiven
himself for that.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.965
He's planning
on leaving him behind?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.749
Maybe. I don't know.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.229
[phone rings]

11:52.668 --> 11:55.453
Shh.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.107
Hello, Lincoln.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.283
It's going down tonight.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.155
Tonight?

12:02.373 --> 12:03.548
Should I be worried?

12:03.592 --> 12:05.463
I called you first thing.

12:05.507 --> 12:06.638
I'm being straight up with you.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.511
Aw, that's refreshing.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.426
LINCOLN:
So I'll see you tonight.

12:11.469 --> 12:15.343
You show me yours
and I'll show you mine.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.304
It's going down tonight.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.349
Do you know about that?

12:21.392 --> 12:24.482
I didn't know, I swear.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.184
Get out of here.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.843
[bottle breaks]

12:43.023 --> 12:44.285
LINCOLN:
How'd it go?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.547
She found the bomb, Linc.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.636
The one we put in her car.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.377
How did she find the bomb,
Sucre?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.987
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.380
It's not your fault.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.424
Look, I'll make it

12:53.468 --> 12:54.338
up to you, I swear.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.558
You can start now.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.429
Michael's in a bit of trouble
at Sona.

12:58.473 --> 13:01.041
What kind of trouble?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.612
The rain stopped.
Does that mean...?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.919
No. The damage is done.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.792
We can't risk waiting.

13:17.405 --> 13:18.536
[sighs]

13:18.580 --> 13:20.582
Anything interesting?

13:20.625 --> 13:21.888
Like some coordinates

13:21.931 --> 13:23.585
the Company might want
to get their hands on?

13:23.628 --> 13:27.110
If they didn't want me
out of here

13:27.154 --> 13:32.550
and your nephew was safe,
would you still be doing this?

13:32.594 --> 13:35.205
Breaking out?

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
No.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.558
Why would you choose to stay if
there was a chance at freedom?

13:40.602 --> 13:43.823
Well, I guess that's
the difference between us.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.390
I'm willing to pay for my sins.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.609
And I'm not?

13:47.652 --> 13:49.916
That's a good question.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.921
[grunts]

13:54.964 --> 13:58.228
[grunting]

13:58.272 --> 14:00.840
Water's coming down pretty fast
up in here, Patron.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.843
Yeah. We have
to dig faster.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.540
You know,
I've been thinking.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.499
It doesn't have
to be every man
for himself.

14:08.543 --> 14:11.372
You and I can
help each other.

14:11.415 --> 14:14.462
If I need a hand,
I'll find someone with a spare.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.637
[laughs]

14:15.680 --> 14:17.552
While it's true
I may be lacking

14:17.595 --> 14:18.770
something in the west,

14:18.814 --> 14:21.556
I more than make up
for it in the north.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.166
Think about it.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.256
Scofield's got us down here
doing manual labor; slave labor.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.435
I ain't no slave.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.872
I'm doing this for me.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.569
Why do you think
Scofield's up there

14:34.612 --> 14:35.613
and we're down here?

14:35.657 --> 14:37.485
He's planning something.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.444
Who among us isn't?

14:40.488 --> 14:42.490
[rumbling]

14:42.533 --> 14:44.622
What the hell
is that?

15:07.558 --> 15:08.995
[thudding]

15:13.738 --> 15:16.698
[rumbling]

15:33.671 --> 15:36.370
[engine revving]

15:40.678 --> 15:42.593
[speaking Spanish]

15:48.164 --> 15:50.123
[speaking Spanish]

16:15.800 --> 16:17.585
[shouting in Spanish]

16:20.936 --> 16:22.938
We're good.
Yeah.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.723
We're all right.
Okay.

16:42.697 --> 16:46.570
[phone ringing]

16:46.614 --> 16:48.703
Yeah.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.184
Hello, Lincoln.
Long time no see.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.533
Not long enough.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.708
I was thinking that we could

16:53.751 --> 16:55.623
have a little chat in person.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.581
Make sure we're all
on the same page

16:57.625 --> 16:58.713
about what's gonna happen
tonight.

16:58.756 --> 16:59.801
All right.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.282
30 minutes, this location.

17:05.763 --> 17:09.637
MAN:
Jorge! Jorge!

17:11.682 --> 17:14.207
[speaking Spanish]

17:14.250 --> 17:15.773
[speaking Spanish]

17:26.610 --> 17:28.612
[phone rings]

17:28.656 --> 17:30.658
Hello.Hey, papi, it's me.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.138
Hey.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.661
Lincoln said
you needed some help.

17:33.704 --> 17:37.230
How much do you know
about electricity?

17:40.668 --> 17:42.974
Hey, you're back.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.803
I'm not real comfortable being
alone down here with those...

17:47.196 --> 17:48.415
What's that?

17:48.458 --> 17:51.896
Syrup; honey.
Make a little pile of dirt.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.246
Gather some dirt.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.466
Scofield said we got to make

17:56.510 --> 17:58.816
something to cover
the hole once we get out.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.776
So when the lights go back on

18:01.819 --> 18:04.822
it's gonna look like
nobody ever left.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.695
Go ahead.
Spread it around.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.740
I was thinking...

18:09.784 --> 18:12.395
we should be
a team, you know?

18:12.439 --> 18:15.181
Not just during
the escape, but after.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.660
Like, like Butch
and Sundance.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.620
Butch and Sundance died.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.361
Well, I mean in the other parts.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.710
Here's an idea.

18:22.753 --> 18:23.885
We go along
with Scofield's plan,

18:23.928 --> 18:25.191
then, when everyone stops

18:25.234 --> 18:26.670
to take a breath,
we grab 'em--

18:26.714 --> 18:28.150
Burroughs,
Scofield, Bagwell.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.673
We take 'em back home
to face charges.

18:29.717 --> 18:30.718
Hell, we'd be heroes.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.720
Might even get
a book deal.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.069
We could write it
together, Alex.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.723
How'd that be?
A book deal?

18:35.766 --> 18:36.637
Yeah.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.378
Gonna make you happy, Brad?

18:38.421 --> 18:40.162
You got a better idea?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.686
Yeah, I do.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.906
Something to do
with a wife and kid?

18:44.949 --> 18:46.299
Yeah, something
like that.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.867
You got room for one more?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.521
Come on, Alex.

18:51.565 --> 18:52.783
What's a guy like me gonna do?

18:52.827 --> 18:55.612
Let's just let Scofield
get us out of here,

18:55.656 --> 18:57.701
and then we'll worry
about everything
else, all right?

18:57.745 --> 18:59.442
All right.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.749
Come on. A little more dirt.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.450
Listen very carefully
and do exactly as I tell you.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.322
You sure you don't want Linc
to do this?

19:09.365 --> 19:10.975
He knows more about this
than I do.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.412
It's not about what you know.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.456
It's about where you work.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.415
And as a Sona employee,
my friend,

19:15.458 --> 19:17.765
you have the unique ability
of not getting shot

19:17.808 --> 19:18.635
for being here.

19:20.768 --> 19:22.813
You see the admin building?

19:22.857 --> 19:24.119
I see it.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.468
Go to it and make a left.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.558
To it and left. Got it.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.604
On the other side is a berm.

19:30.647 --> 19:31.779
There should be a metal cage.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.476
That's the backup generator.

19:36.827 --> 19:39.439
Okay, I see it.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.746
Don't let the tower guard
see you get too close.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.747
Just act casual.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.227
When I say now,

19:45.271 --> 19:47.708
you run and duck behind it.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.802
Almost.

19:58.153 --> 19:58.936
Hold on.

20:02.853 --> 20:03.463
Now!

20:11.166 --> 20:12.036
Okay.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.604
Okay. There should be

20:14.648 --> 20:15.910
some writing near the bottom.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.781
I need the name
of the manufacturer,

20:17.825 --> 20:18.826
make and model number,
anything.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

20:21.959 --> 20:23.091
I got it, I got it.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.876
It's, uh, it's, uh,
Prana Industrial.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.967
Model number 3210.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.405
3210. Is there a customer
service number?

20:34.015 --> 20:36.931
1-800-555-0196.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.587
All right. Thanks.
That's all I need.

20:40.630 --> 20:43.546
You really think you can
pull this off tonight?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.592
You want to know the truth?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.855
No, I just want
all of it go down smooth.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.423
For everyone
to get what they want.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.773
Yeah, I do.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.602
Listen, even if you get this
worked out with the lights,

20:55.645 --> 20:57.386
what are you gonna do
about the jeep patrols?

20:57.430 --> 20:59.867
We're just gonna have
to take our chances.

20:59.910 --> 21:02.348
Maybe you don't.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.805
You all right?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.850
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.852
Where's LJ?

21:28.896 --> 21:31.202
Somewhere safe.
Take a load off.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.204
Can I offer you a drink?

21:33.248 --> 21:35.990
What's going on, Susan?

21:36.033 --> 21:38.079
I just wanted
to get everyone together

21:38.122 --> 21:39.863
so we can discuss
tonight's agenda.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.343
Maybe nail down
a few guidelines.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.997
It's the same as before,
nothing has changed.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.390
Actually, I was thinking

21:44.433 --> 21:46.957
we should probably include
all the players.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.785
Don't you?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.963
What are you doing in here?

21:53.007 --> 21:55.052
Just keeping watch.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.751
Make sure nobody tries
to get down to the tunnel.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.625
Who are you calling?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.888
Yeah, hi. Is this,
uh, Customer Service?

22:04.932 --> 22:06.281
Yeah, I'm, uh...

22:06.325 --> 22:08.979
I'm a sub working, building
down here in Panama,

22:09.023 --> 22:11.634
and, um, we got
a client on-site.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.853
They're asking questions

22:12.896 --> 22:15.682
about the 3210 generator
we're installing.

22:15.725 --> 22:18.728
Yeah. Exactly. Um...

22:18.772 --> 22:20.687
Anyway, they want to know,
if the main power shuts down,

22:20.730 --> 22:22.428
how long are they
gonna be in the dark,

22:22.471 --> 22:26.432
um, before the
generator kicks in?

22:26.475 --> 22:27.476
Yeah. Thanks.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.130
I'll hold.

22:29.173 --> 22:30.871
You're a very good liar.

22:33.961 --> 22:36.529
That's the timing?

22:36.572 --> 22:38.052
No, that's, uh...

22:38.095 --> 22:39.053
That's it.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.489
Appreciate it.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.057
Well?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.058
We gonna make it?

22:44.101 --> 22:45.189
We should have

22:45.233 --> 22:46.887
just enough dark
to make it out.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.106
With everyone?

22:49.150 --> 22:50.151
[phone ringing]

22:50.194 --> 22:50.978
Hey.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.762
You with Whistler?

22:53.807 --> 22:55.635
Yes.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.507
Susan's with me-- she wants
to get a message to him.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.162
Why?

23:01.205 --> 23:02.032
Put him on.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.123
It's for you.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.566
Yes?All right, I got him. What now?

23:13.609 --> 23:15.524
SUSAN B.:
Tell him I want him to listen

23:15.568 --> 23:18.484
very carefully
to the following instructions.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.963
She wants you
to listen real care...

23:20.007 --> 23:21.095
I can hear.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.183
Instructions about what?

23:22.226 --> 23:23.271
James?

23:23.314 --> 23:26.187
Was that Sofia? Is she there?

23:26.230 --> 23:26.970
Yeah.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.624
What's going on?

23:28.668 --> 23:30.017
He wants to know
what this is about.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.497
All right.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.759
I'll tell him.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.500
[Sofia screaming]

23:35.501 --> 23:36.502
No!

23:36.545 --> 23:39.200
WHISTLER:
Was... was that Sof...

23:40.027 --> 23:41.985
Is that Sofia?

23:42.029 --> 23:43.857
Is that Sofia?!

23:46.860 --> 23:48.296
Have you figured out

23:48.339 --> 23:50.951
the coordinates yet, James?

23:52.953 --> 23:53.867
Please.

23:53.910 --> 23:54.998
Almost.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.086
Wrong answer.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.436
No![Sofia screams]

23:57.479 --> 23:59.220
I'll get them for you
when we get out

23:59.263 --> 24:00.482
of here, I swear.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.050
All your promises,
your guarantees--

24:03.093 --> 24:04.355
they mean nothing.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.010
I'm pretty sick
of waiting around for you boys

24:07.054 --> 24:08.490
to screw me over.

24:08.534 --> 24:12.668
I'm gonna need those coordinates
by the end of the day.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.844
No!
[screaming]

24:31.078 --> 24:32.862
[sobbing]

24:35.822 --> 24:38.215
I've gotta figure this out.

24:38.259 --> 24:39.826
I've gotta do something.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.262
Gotta do something.

24:43.786 --> 24:47.050
We both know that you can't just
hand over that information.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.444
Why? Why can't I?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.533
Once they get
what they want,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.143
they'll have no reason
to keep you

24:53.187 --> 24:56.190
or your girlfriend
or my nephew alive.

24:56.233 --> 24:58.584
So what do I do?

24:58.627 --> 24:59.541
I, I just,

24:59.585 --> 25:01.674
I just let them
torture Sofia?

25:01.717 --> 25:03.676
MICHAEL:
We'll work something out.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.201
We'll think it through.

25:07.244 --> 25:08.550
I already have.

25:16.210 --> 25:19.256
Whistler...

25:19.300 --> 25:20.344
Whistler. What is

25:20.388 --> 25:23.870
so special about him
anyway, huh?

25:23.913 --> 25:25.828
Huh?

25:25.872 --> 25:28.091
You think he has anything to do
with why them people

25:28.135 --> 25:30.137
wanted Scofield down here
in the first place?

25:30.180 --> 25:31.530
It's really none of my business.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.880
What exactly is
your business, Alex?

25:33.923 --> 25:35.185
Something on your mind?

25:35.229 --> 25:38.362
I'm just saying...

25:38.406 --> 25:40.582
If we needed a bargaining chip,

25:40.626 --> 25:42.236
do you think...

25:42.279 --> 25:44.804
a sharp stick in that dull Limey
would help us out?

25:44.847 --> 25:46.283
There is no "us."

25:46.327 --> 25:47.937
You and me are
a lot more

25:47.981 --> 25:51.158
alike than you think, Alex.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.420
We both know how it feels

25:52.463 --> 25:55.162
to lose a
great love.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.817
How it feels
to kill a man.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.733
And we both ended up in here
because of Michael Scofield.

26:00.776 --> 26:03.910
Wouldn't it be poetic justice
if we could just...

26:03.953 --> 26:05.346
return the favor?

26:05.389 --> 26:07.566
Justice...

26:09.132 --> 26:14.747
If there was an ounce of it
left in this world...

26:14.790 --> 26:17.663
you'd be lying face down
in the same unmarked grave

26:17.706 --> 26:20.230
as the rest
of your inbred family.

26:23.930 --> 26:27.716
The only difference between
me and you, Alex, is a badge,

26:27.760 --> 26:30.240
and the last time I checked,
you didn't even have that,

26:30.284 --> 26:32.982
so you can just keep on hoping
for your happy endings, Alex,

26:33.026 --> 26:34.941
You just keep on plowing
ahead with them blinders on,

26:34.984 --> 26:37.770
you know, but the thing
about them blinders is...

26:38.771 --> 26:42.035
it makes it really hard
to watch your back.

26:50.304 --> 26:52.349
It's gonna be better
soon, I promise.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.265
He's right, you know.
If James loves you

26:55.309 --> 26:57.833
the way he says he does,
he'll give us what we want,

26:57.877 --> 26:59.574
and then you and
your white knight

26:59.618 --> 27:01.315
can ride off
into the sunset.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.797
Unless you're already
with him.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.410
You scared, Susan?

27:09.453 --> 27:11.586
Do I look scared, Lincoln?

27:11.630 --> 27:14.894
To pull something like this...

27:14.937 --> 27:15.938
You desperate?

27:15.982 --> 27:17.418
You need to stop
fighting with me.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.593
If you really understood

27:18.637 --> 27:20.116
what was going on,
you would know that

27:20.160 --> 27:21.335
we're not the bad guys.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.205
Could've fooled me.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.380
Haven't you ever done

27:23.424 --> 27:24.686
the wrong things for
the right reason?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.601
What are the right
reasons, Susan?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.082
What is it about Whistler
that's so important.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.609
I could tell you.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.393
But then I'd have to kill you.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.832
You're gonna do that anyway.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.617
SUSAN B.:
Whistler gives us what we want,

27:42.661 --> 27:45.664
maybe I won't
have to.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.454
Linc called.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.760
They're on
their way.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.372
I figured them out.

27:58.415 --> 28:00.722
The coordinates.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.421
I'm gonna hand them over.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.771
I thought you should know,

28:05.814 --> 28:09.731
so you can take whatever
precautions you can.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.037
What if, uh...

28:11.080 --> 28:13.648
What if you give them
the wrong coordinates.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.302
It might buy us some more time.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.869
Maybe Linc can get
Sofia to safety.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.784
Like he did with Sara?

28:22.483 --> 28:24.833
I'm sorry. I...

28:24.877 --> 28:26.356
I didn't mean to.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.489
I, uh...

28:28.532 --> 28:31.753
I just don't know
what else to do.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.538
I'm damned if I do,
damned if I don't.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.540
There's no
way to win.

28:36.584 --> 28:37.933
It's not about winning anymore.

28:37.977 --> 28:38.978
It's about surviving--

28:39.021 --> 28:40.327
which is not the same

28:40.370 --> 28:41.328
as giving up.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.808
But you can go gracefully.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.462
There's honor.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.855
Protecting the ones you love.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.989
Honor's a luxury
men like us can't afford.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.341
Can you promise me we'll
make it out of here tonight?

28:54.384 --> 28:56.386
No games.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.910
Can you honestly promise me?

28:57.953 --> 29:00.913
I can promise you I'll do
everything in my power.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.917
I wish that were good enough.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.353
If you do this...

29:06.396 --> 29:08.137
If you give them
what they want...

29:08.181 --> 29:10.270
everything
that's been lost

29:10.313 --> 29:11.793
will have been for nothing.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.026
Monjares.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.332
[speaking Spanish]

29:29.376 --> 29:31.378
Vamos.

29:40.604 --> 29:44.434
[speaking Spanish]

29:48.612 --> 29:52.094
[speaking Spanish]

30:22.777 --> 30:23.909
Jorge.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.346
[speaking Spanish]

30:54.591 --> 30:56.898
[man speaking Spanish
over P.A.]

31:19.616 --> 31:22.881
[keypad beeping]

31:25.535 --> 31:26.623
Linc, he's gonna...

31:26.667 --> 31:27.842
He's gonna give it to them.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.626
Relax. I'll see you in a minute.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.933
What are you talking about?

31:31.977 --> 31:33.935
[man speaking Spanish
over P.A.]

31:39.636 --> 31:40.899
I suppose

31:40.942 --> 31:42.683
introductions are
unnecessary at this point.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.511
What are we doing
here, Gretchen?

31:44.554 --> 31:46.426
We're here to
say good-bye.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.601
I promise you, sweetheart,

31:47.644 --> 31:49.559
they're not going
to hurt you anymore.

31:49.603 --> 31:52.040
Do you have the
coordinates, James?

31:52.084 --> 31:53.737
Yes.
I'm sorry.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.218
I tried to run away...

31:56.262 --> 31:57.306
This is not your fault.

31:58.525 --> 31:59.482
It's mine.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.745
When I took this job,

32:01.789 --> 32:04.835
I knew they
weren't good people.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.663
I just didn't know
how bad they were.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.450
And everything
that's happened...

32:15.411 --> 32:16.586
it's all because of me.

32:17.631 --> 32:20.590
And for that I'm truly sorry.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.636
The coordinates.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.943
Just pass them through.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.824
What the hell are you doing?

32:36.867 --> 32:38.913
I'm buying some goodwill.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.393
You're buying her funeral.

32:40.436 --> 32:41.611
WHISTLER:
You know I have

32:41.655 --> 32:43.483
what you need.

32:43.526 --> 32:46.181
And I'll give you the rest.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.140
But only after I know

32:48.183 --> 32:51.578
that Sofia, that LJ,

32:51.621 --> 32:53.972
and that
these men here...

32:56.235 --> 32:59.542
...they're all safe.

32:59.586 --> 33:02.067
Do you understand me?

33:02.110 --> 33:04.417
James...

33:04.460 --> 33:06.419
Everything's gonna be all right.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.898
SUSAN B.:
I'm impressed.

33:07.942 --> 33:12.077
It seems our fisherman
grew himself a set of oysters.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.035
Can you really
trust these men

33:14.079 --> 33:16.255
with her life?

33:18.735 --> 33:19.649
Yeah.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.695
Yeah, I believe I can.

33:21.738 --> 33:22.957
All right, James.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.482
But there's been some confusion

33:26.526 --> 33:29.094
about the timing of things--
last-minute changes,

33:29.137 --> 33:30.486
et cetera.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.576
I'm gonna make this clear
for everyone involved.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.709
If time runs out
and I don't have

33:35.752 --> 33:37.754
the second half
of those coordinates,

33:37.798 --> 33:39.626
LJ and the
senorita

33:39.669 --> 33:41.628
stop breathing.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.155
Say good-bye, sweetheart.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.635
Lincoln! Linc...

33:48.678 --> 33:51.159
Don't be stupid, Lincoln.

33:58.601 --> 34:01.169
I've helped you.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.651
Now you help me.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.655
Please.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.312
Just get us out of here.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.718
You sure about the timing
on the backup generator?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.764
Yeah. All we
got to do now

34:30.807 --> 34:32.331
is cut the power
to the exterior lights.

34:32.374 --> 34:33.636
How are you gonna do that?

34:33.680 --> 34:36.465
I'm not-- they can't be accessed
from the inside.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.774
How much time have I got?

34:40.817 --> 34:42.123
Let's say, uh,
5:15 tomorrow morning.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.472
That should give us enough time

34:43.516 --> 34:46.127
to dig out the tunnel
before the sun comes up.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.129
All right. What about Whistler?What about him?

34:48.173 --> 34:49.696
Well, he manned up--
he could've handed over

34:49.739 --> 34:50.914
the information,
but he didn't.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.481
Still concerned about
handing him over?

34:52.525 --> 34:55.005
I've got my concerns about
pretty much everybody, Linc.

34:55.049 --> 34:56.790
You know what I mean?

34:56.833 --> 34:57.878
Yeah.

34:57.921 --> 35:01.273
Mostly, I'm just tired.

35:01.316 --> 35:04.711
Tired of choices...

35:04.754 --> 35:06.060
consequences.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.845
I just want this
to be over... tonight.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.153
Let's do it.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.639
[Spanish music playing]

35:28.909 --> 35:31.825
When you're on the run,

35:31.868 --> 35:34.436
you're always looking
over your shoulder,

35:34.480 --> 35:36.699
listening for the sirens,

35:36.743 --> 35:38.092
wondering if that

35:38.136 --> 35:40.834
pretty girl across the street
is staring at you

35:40.877 --> 35:41.965
because she wants you,

35:42.009 --> 35:45.230
or... because
you're wanted.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.756
You change your name,

35:49.799 --> 35:52.193
the way you look...
[sniffles]

35:52.237 --> 35:54.543
and leave everything
you ever knew behind.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.632
And the ones you love,

35:56.676 --> 35:59.592
they're the ones
who have to pay.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.812
That's what's waiting for you
on the outside.

36:02.856 --> 36:05.163
That's why
I couldn't bring you on.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.688
Because nothing good
can come of this.

36:10.342 --> 36:13.214
Can anything good
come from staying in?

36:15.651 --> 36:17.871
It has to be your decision.

36:17.914 --> 36:18.785
I...

36:18.828 --> 36:22.354
I cannot be responsible for you.

36:23.616 --> 36:26.184
You won't have to be.

36:28.621 --> 36:32.451
Does your father still have
that phone number I gave you?

36:33.930 --> 36:35.193
I think so.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.325
Well, tell him
to call my brother

36:37.369 --> 36:40.633
if he wants to find out
where to pick you up tomorrow.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.551
Does that mean...

36:45.594 --> 36:49.207
It means if a million
things fall into place...

36:49.250 --> 36:52.253
I'm gonna see my father
tomorrow.

36:53.428 --> 36:56.388
Don't let anyone see you
with that phone.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.138
I think we did it, Michael.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.444
I believe we're ready.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.707
She's a little wet,
but she's ready.

37:11.751 --> 37:12.882
Makes me think
of the first thing

37:12.926 --> 37:14.536
I'll do when
we're gonna get out.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.974
Just, does anybody know what's
Spanish for "Don't shoot"?

37:18.018 --> 37:19.802
No dispare.

37:19.846 --> 37:20.890
No dis what?

37:20.934 --> 37:22.501
Just relax.
Nobody's gonna get shot.

37:22.544 --> 37:23.676
Just don't panic.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.765
As soon as Linc cuts
the power, we go.

37:25.808 --> 37:26.940
What about the jeep patrol?

37:26.983 --> 37:28.202
Taken care of.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.943
What about the backup generator?

37:29.986 --> 37:31.640
Backup generator?

37:31.684 --> 37:32.728
Nobody said anything about...

37:32.772 --> 37:33.990
There's a lag
from when the power

37:34.034 --> 37:35.644
cuts out to when
the generator kicks back in.

37:35.688 --> 37:38.256
Well, how long a lag
are we talking about here?

37:38.299 --> 37:40.823
30 seconds.

37:40.867 --> 37:44.000
You expect us to run
in 30 seconds?

37:44.044 --> 37:46.655
As soon as the lights
go out, I'm gone.

37:46.699 --> 37:49.005
With or without you.

38:19.558 --> 38:24.737
[low electrical humming]

38:31.918 --> 38:34.616
[engine starts]

38:35.574 --> 38:37.706
[speaking Spanish]

38:40.056 --> 38:42.885
[speaking Spanish]

38:42.929 --> 38:44.496
[engine starts]

38:44.539 --> 38:46.802
[man speaking Spanish
in voice-over]

38:57.552 --> 39:00.773
[man speaking Spanish
in voice-over]

39:20.053 --> 39:22.795
Now.

39:22.838 --> 39:24.797
Let's go.

39:29.976 --> 39:30.759
Off the bus! Now!

39:31.107 --> 39:32.457
Get off the bus!

39:47.602 --> 39:49.952
As soon as the lights go out,
we got to be ready to move.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.172
You want to tell us what
the hell the taquito's
doing down here?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.174
He's coming with us.I don't think so.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.567
That's not up to you.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.570
I sure think.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.181
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.357
See, we made a little,
uh, decision here.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.054
What with the time frame

40:05.098 --> 40:06.665
being so short
and all, we'd feel

40:06.708 --> 40:09.015
a whole lot better about things
if we could go first.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.451
What are you gonna do, kill me?

40:10.495 --> 40:12.453
T-BAG:
No, no. See, if we ain't first,

40:12.497 --> 40:14.412
he's not going at all!All right.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.457
MICHAEL:
All right! Just...

40:19.634 --> 40:21.680
[speaking Spanish]

40:23.029 --> 40:24.987
[laughs]

40:25.031 --> 40:26.902
[speaking Spanish]

40:38.610 --> 40:40.133
All right.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.048
All right, go. Just go.

40:42.091 --> 40:43.745
Just go.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.408
[panting]

40:54.452 --> 40:57.063
Every man for
himself, right?

41:11.556 --> 41:14.646
You want to move up
in line, too?

41:15.603 --> 41:18.432
No, I think
I'm gonna stay back here.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.653
I just don't want to turn
my back on anybody.

41:43.152 --> 41:44.937
[speaking Spanish]

41:46.155 --> 41:50.116
[engine stalling out]

42:20.189 --> 42:23.062
[engine revving]

42:39.513 --> 42:41.863
[electrical crackling,
popping]

42:49.828 --> 42:53.005
30 seconds. Go.
