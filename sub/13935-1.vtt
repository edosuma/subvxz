01:50.700 --> 01:52.327
Good evening, Miss Lake.

03:12.415 --> 03:14.349
Aaah!

04:45.542 --> 04:47.169
This is so sad.

05:34.023 --> 05:38.926
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

05:38.995 --> 05:40.622
Please, let me through.

05:40.697 --> 05:41.789
Please.

05:46.469 --> 05:48.562
Bravo, I say!

05:49.439 --> 05:51.134
Ryan rules!

05:53.576 --> 05:54.736
Congratulations.

05:54.811 --> 05:57.075
Thank you, thank you.

05:59.182 --> 06:00.877
Here you go.

06:00.950 --> 06:02.440
Mitsubishi.

06:02.519 --> 06:04.578
Mr. Harrison...

06:04.654 --> 06:06.281
...here you go.

06:09.359 --> 06:13.261
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

06:13.329 --> 06:16.321
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

06:21.037 --> 06:24.302
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

06:29.312 --> 06:30.836
Thank you.
Nice talking with you.

06:33.883 --> 06:35.111
Cass Lake.

06:35.184 --> 06:36.913
No, Ryan Harrison.

06:36.986 --> 06:38.613
You're mixing me up with some woman.

06:38.688 --> 06:40.451
I'd love to have you
sit for me some time.

06:40.523 --> 06:41.751
Are you a dog trainer?

06:42.825 --> 06:45.157
No, portraits.

06:45.228 --> 06:47.321
I've seen every one of your concerts.

06:47.397 --> 06:49.160
Your music moved me.

06:49.232 --> 06:51.496
Nothing like a good movement.

06:51.568 --> 06:54.298
Oh, Allah!

06:54.370 --> 06:55.632
Oh, my balls!

06:56.539 --> 06:58.200
Muslim prayers.

06:58.274 --> 06:59.866
That must be east.

07:00.877 --> 07:02.276
Well, excuse me.

07:02.345 --> 07:03.835
My hand!

07:03.913 --> 07:04.902
Hibbing Goodhue.

07:04.981 --> 07:07.779
Maestro Harrison, welcome.

07:07.850 --> 07:09.010
Thank you for inviting me.

07:09.085 --> 07:10.279
I need to talk to you.

07:10.353 --> 07:12.514
Cass, I have guests.

07:12.589 --> 07:15.820
It's been a privilege
sponsoring your concerts.

07:15.892 --> 07:20.124
I'm eternally grateful to my husband for
bringing you into my life, Mr. Harrison.

07:20.196 --> 07:22.391
I think this deserves a kiss,
don't you?

07:28.471 --> 07:30.701
I've never missed one of your concerts.

07:30.773 --> 07:32.502
Hibbing, however,
wasn't at Friday's.

07:33.376 --> 07:36.038
It was a high colonic.

07:36.112 --> 07:37.909
Yes, a Jewish holiday.
Mazel tov.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.184
I'll just round us up some drinks.

07:44.821 --> 07:46.049
How dare you?

07:46.122 --> 07:47.851
How could you ignore my note?

07:47.924 --> 07:50.358
All I want is for you to reconsider.
Hibbing, please.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.519
- Ryan.
- Oh, stuff and nonsense!

07:52.595 --> 07:56.053
Go dash a mineral water in your face
and buck up!

07:58.735 --> 08:01.226
You deserve a real man's drink.

08:05.808 --> 08:07.173
Bottoms up.

08:07.243 --> 08:09.040
I know mine will be.

08:13.616 --> 08:15.880
- Good-bye, darling!
- Have a safe flight.

08:15.952 --> 08:19.046
Could you please open the gates for me?

08:19.122 --> 08:20.589
Never mind!

08:22.125 --> 08:23.854
Ryan, what are you doing?

08:23.926 --> 08:26.690
Your dog certainly has
a surprised look on his face.

08:26.763 --> 08:28.754
Well, that's because
you're looking at his butt.

08:30.199 --> 08:32.224
Uh... oh.

08:32.301 --> 08:36.397
Then he's certainly not going to enjoy
that treat that I just fed to him.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.373
Well, I guess I'd better be--

08:39.442 --> 08:41.136
I don't think so.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.040
Now they're safe.

08:47.116 --> 08:49.084
I thought I might go for a swim.

08:50.019 --> 08:51.486
Would you care to join me?

08:51.554 --> 08:53.613
I have a suit for you.

08:53.690 --> 08:55.021
Mrs. Goodhue...

08:55.091 --> 08:56.422
...I think that we should
say good-bye now.

08:58.561 --> 09:00.051
No, please.

09:00.129 --> 09:03.587
My head is spinning like a dreidel
in a sandstorm. I should go--

09:06.869 --> 09:10.430
Kissing you makes me think
about your husband.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.599
You do like women?

09:12.675 --> 09:13.664
Of course.

09:13.743 --> 09:16.906
But you're a married one.
I'm not.

09:16.979 --> 09:19.743
Hibbing won't be back for three days.

09:19.816 --> 09:21.078
Stay?

09:21.150 --> 09:23.516
You don't know what you're missing.

09:23.586 --> 09:25.679
I used to lick envelopes for a living.

09:25.755 --> 09:27.780
Those long manila ones.

09:29.692 --> 09:31.421
I'm not wearing any underwear.

09:32.695 --> 09:35.630
Ohh!

09:54.617 --> 09:56.141
Intruder, intruder.

09:56.219 --> 09:58.517
Step away from the car.
Step away from the car.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.217
System deactivated.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.519
Get into the car.

10:03.593 --> 10:06.824
Get into the car.
Get into the car.

10:13.536 --> 10:16.334
Ryan, darling, why are you leaving me?
Hibbing is out of town.

10:16.405 --> 10:18.703
If I don't see you tonight,
I'm prepared to take my own life.

10:18.775 --> 10:19.833
I am desperate!

10:19.909 --> 10:21.342
And I'm out of milk.

10:21.410 --> 10:24.345
Can you pick up a half gallon
of two percent on the way?

10:27.984 --> 10:30.077
Yours in adultery, Lauren.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.559
Ruth Kimball, in New York.

10:38.628 --> 10:41.222
And I'm speaking with
United Nations Secretary General...

10:41.297 --> 10:42.696
...Sir Robert McKintyre.

10:42.765 --> 10:46.531
I'd like to thank our friend, Hibbing
Goodhue, for arranging this interview.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.934
Hibbing has been my good friend
since our school days at...

10:49.005 --> 10:50.700
...Cherry Pants-upon-Buttocks.

10:50.773 --> 10:54.072
He's invited you to come to Columbia
Heights to make an important speech.

10:54.143 --> 10:56.703
A speech that will have terrorists
peeing their pants.

10:56.779 --> 10:57.768
Quite.

10:57.847 --> 10:59.838
I am forming
a multinational strike force...

10:59.916 --> 11:03.215
...whose sole purpose is to tear at
the very heart of terrorism...

11:03.286 --> 11:07.450
...by seeking out and destroying their
sanctuaries and training compounds.

11:07.523 --> 11:10.720
I will be placing every terrorist
on alert...

11:10.793 --> 11:13.193
...that their days are indeed numbered.

11:25.374 --> 11:26.306
Yes!

11:30.313 --> 11:31.405
...a lesbian...

11:31.480 --> 11:33.107
- ...oral...
- ...used to masturbate...

11:33.182 --> 11:35.047
...nymphomaniac Siamese twins...

11:35.117 --> 11:36.709
...who cheat with
each other's husbands.

11:36.786 --> 11:38.413
But first, it's official!

11:38.487 --> 11:41.581
The United Nations Secretary General,
Sir Robert McKintyre...

11:41.657 --> 11:44.319
...will be in Columbia Heights
on the 12th of this month...

11:44.393 --> 11:46.258
...as guest of Hibbing Goodhue.

11:46.329 --> 11:49.264
Sir Robert will be speaking
at our Columbia Heights Jamboree...

11:49.332 --> 11:52.961
...and will be the highlight of this
year's celebration of Scottish heritage.

11:53.035 --> 11:54.593
The Brave-Roy pipe and drill team--

11:54.670 --> 11:57.002
...I'm not having orgasms... gay guys...

11:57.073 --> 11:58.802
It's you!

11:59.809 --> 12:03.575
I've been drinking several toasts
to your honor tonight, my dear.

12:03.646 --> 12:06.774
Yes, to the great deceiver.

12:08.551 --> 12:10.678
You never loved me.

12:11.354 --> 12:14.346
You only wanted me
for my connection with...

12:14.423 --> 12:15.947
...McKintyre.

12:16.025 --> 12:18.289
And for my quiet shoreline...

12:18.361 --> 12:21.626
...the perfect place to land
a small group of terrorists.

12:21.697 --> 12:25.463
This is about assassination.

12:25.534 --> 12:27.468
°°

12:27.536 --> 12:30.130
Turn that bloody radio off!

12:31.874 --> 12:35.810
Please, that's far too melodramatic.

12:40.016 --> 12:41.210
Ouch!

12:52.929 --> 12:54.362
Aaah!

13:04.874 --> 13:06.671
Bloody hell!

13:08.077 --> 13:10.011
Have you quite finished?

13:57.460 --> 13:58.984
Lauren?

14:02.431 --> 14:04.092
I read your note.

14:06.535 --> 14:08.901
I'm not here to play games, Lauren.

14:11.674 --> 14:13.073
Where are you?

14:19.648 --> 14:21.081
Lauren?

14:23.219 --> 14:24.618
I-- Oh.

14:24.687 --> 14:27.554
I want you to understand.
There's nothing between us.

14:28.391 --> 14:31.087
You're not Lauren!
You're an imposter!

14:53.716 --> 14:54.648
"Hylander"?

15:24.847 --> 15:25.939
Goodhue!

15:57.446 --> 15:58.970
Where the hell were you?!

15:59.048 --> 16:00.675
You made a mess of things.

16:00.749 --> 16:02.148
At least you did your job.

16:02.218 --> 16:04.186
Goodhue knew too much.
He had to die.

16:04.253 --> 16:07.916
As for this sorry sod, you've given
the authorities Hibbing's murderer.

16:08.824 --> 16:13.193
I expect we'll move forward
with no further interference...

16:13.262 --> 16:17.358
...with Operation Hylander,
the killing of the U.N.'s McKintyre.

16:24.173 --> 16:26.971
We have a code 3, 43rd and Jefferson.

16:37.319 --> 16:38.251
Say "cheese."

16:39.455 --> 16:40.786
Who's that?
Where'd he come from?

16:40.856 --> 16:42.881
He's got a gun!
Get the gun!

16:42.958 --> 16:44.391
You have the right to remain silent.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.394
Anything you say may be
held against you.

16:46.462 --> 16:48.953
One nation, indivisible,
till death do us part.

16:49.932 --> 16:51.832
- Van Atter!
- Yeah?

16:51.901 --> 16:53.892
Take this blood sample to the lab.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.994
And don't go walking around
with it all day.

16:56.071 --> 16:57.129
Up yours!

16:57.206 --> 17:00.733
Get him in the car. All right,
people, get him in the car.

17:00.809 --> 17:02.071
Give us room.

17:02.144 --> 17:04.806
Stand back, people.
Give him a little air, people.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.973
I want you people back.
Hold them back, hold them back.

17:08.050 --> 17:09.517
I'm innocent.

17:09.585 --> 17:11.348
I'm being wrongfully accused.

17:11.420 --> 17:13.354
Guilt or innocence,
that's not my job.

17:13.422 --> 17:16.220
It's my duty to pick up
scum-sucking punks like yourself...

17:16.291 --> 17:17.919
...who are accused of a crime.

17:17.992 --> 17:20.154
A jury of twelve really stupid people...

17:20.229 --> 17:23.061
...who are easily swayed by rich,
fat-cat, slimy lawyers...

17:23.132 --> 17:25.862
...who'll do anything but tell the
truth, will sit in judgement of you.

17:25.935 --> 17:27.993
It's as American as a burrito.

17:28.971 --> 17:30.939
Ryan and I were having sex.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.167
Hot, steamy, sweaty sex.

17:33.242 --> 17:35.733
Every part of my body tingled,
orgasm after orgasm--

17:35.811 --> 17:39.076
Lady, I just asked for your name.

17:39.148 --> 17:40.911
Mrs. Hibbing Goodhue.

17:40.983 --> 17:44.680
I was weak to Ryan's charms.
He wanted me to leave Hibbing.

17:45.654 --> 17:47.952
He said he just wanted to talk to him.

17:49.325 --> 17:51.054
I can't believe he killed him.

17:51.126 --> 17:52.354
I came home...

17:52.428 --> 17:53.793
...late last night...

17:54.797 --> 17:55.957
...and there he was.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.397
Now I'm going to have to start...

18:00.469 --> 18:01.902
...dating again.

18:01.971 --> 18:06.670
Mr. Harrison! Mr. Harrison!

18:18.621 --> 18:22.057
Okay, everybody, come on.
Let the car through. Stand back.

18:27.496 --> 18:29.794
Ryan Harrison,
a jury of your peers...

18:29.865 --> 18:32.060
...have found you guilty of murder.

18:32.134 --> 18:34.762
On August 12,
at Stillwater Federal Prison...

18:34.837 --> 18:36.896
...you shall have your sentence
carried out.

18:36.972 --> 18:42.069
You shall be executed buffet style,
lethally injected, electrocuted...

18:42.144 --> 18:44.408
...and placed before a firing squad.

18:44.480 --> 18:49.281
May God have mercy on your soul,
you bastard, you.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.461
Seats in the upright position.

19:07.536 --> 19:10.972
Handcuffs and ankle chains
must be securely fastened...

19:11.040 --> 19:13.634
...or you will be shot.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.643
Exits are clearly marked...

19:15.711 --> 19:17.611
...but you will not be using them.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.011
Should you use them...

19:19.081 --> 19:21.311
...you will be shot.

19:21.383 --> 19:23.146
On behalf of the State of Minnesota...

19:23.218 --> 19:25.652
...thank you for being
arrested and convicted.

19:25.721 --> 19:28.656
Sit back and enjoy your bus ride.

19:48.744 --> 19:51.372
I'm not going to take it any longer.
I'm going to fight back.

19:51.447 --> 19:53.506
I am going to prove
that I am not guilty.

19:53.582 --> 19:54.913
Shut up!

19:54.983 --> 19:57.474
No! I'm being wrongfully accused.

19:58.787 --> 20:00.482
How dare you, sir?

20:00.556 --> 20:01.716
How dare you?!

20:01.790 --> 20:02.757
No, how dare you?!

20:02.825 --> 20:04.190
No, no, how dare you?!

20:04.259 --> 20:06.523
How dare you "no, no"
my "how dare you?!"

20:06.595 --> 20:08.563
You dare to dare me?!

20:08.630 --> 20:10.564
How dare you "how dare me,"
when I "how dare you?!"

20:10.632 --> 20:12.190
You big pee-pee head!

20:12.267 --> 20:14.701
You are the pee-pee head!

20:14.770 --> 20:16.533
Mr. Booger Lips, ca-ca mouth!

20:16.605 --> 20:17.697
Shut up!

20:17.773 --> 20:20.765
You'll never shut me up!

20:26.915 --> 20:29.281
Hey, you pee-pee head!

20:55.010 --> 20:57.570
Hey! I can't see!

20:57.646 --> 21:00.638
Take the wastebasket off your head.

21:01.984 --> 21:03.042
I still can't see!

21:03.118 --> 21:05.609
Take the other one off.

21:06.989 --> 21:07.921
That's better.

21:09.124 --> 21:10.091
Get the keys.

21:10.159 --> 21:12.787
Take off the cuffs.

21:12.861 --> 21:14.829
My shoe's untied.

21:16.165 --> 21:18.429
My shirt's out.

21:22.171 --> 21:24.105
Whoo, whoo.

21:26.508 --> 21:28.442
Whoo?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.612
Oh, no!

21:33.682 --> 21:34.808
- A train!
- A train?

21:51.233 --> 21:52.427
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:52.501 --> 21:54.492
- Thank you. - Thank
you. - Thank you.

22:06.515 --> 22:08.915
Huh? Uh-oh.

24:01.563 --> 24:03.121
Orono! Bagley!

24:03.198 --> 24:05.723
This looks like a trailer park
after a tornado.

24:05.801 --> 24:07.268
All right, speak to me, people.

24:07.336 --> 24:08.769
One prisoner was missing.

24:08.837 --> 24:10.828
- It's a Ryan--
- Harrison.

24:10.906 --> 24:12.897
The man who killed Hibbing Goodhue.

24:12.975 --> 24:16.172
This has more twists and turns
than Chubby Checker in a blender.

24:16.244 --> 24:18.769
So we got us a murderer on the loose!

24:18.847 --> 24:20.508
All right,
listen up, people!

24:20.582 --> 24:22.573
Our man will be on foot
and running.

24:22.651 --> 24:25.142
A man that's tired,
a man that's possibly hurt...

24:25.220 --> 24:27.814
...will have a stride of 4 feet,
2 and 3/4 inches...

24:27.889 --> 24:29.413
...while wearing boxer shorts.

24:29.491 --> 24:31.789
Four feet even,
with the restrictions of a brief.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.920
Which means he will cover
four miles in one hour.

24:34.997 --> 24:37.761
He's got an hour and 3/4 start on us.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.357
He'll take to the nearest highway.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.561
He'll commandeer a car
or hop on a truck.

24:41.637 --> 24:45.630
Now, the average elevation in this area
is 2,057 feet...

24:45.707 --> 24:49.234
...2 and 1/4 inches,
with one exception.

24:49.311 --> 24:53.475
He will take any chances,
do anything to stay a free man.

24:53.548 --> 24:54.480
Climb, hike...

24:54.549 --> 24:56.039
...rappel.

24:56.118 --> 24:57.710
Hell, even fall down a damn mountain.

24:58.954 --> 25:00.717
It's a wilderness out there...

25:00.789 --> 25:03.656
...so this citified sophisticate
better watch himself.

25:03.725 --> 25:05.989
He's in the heart of bear country.

25:09.297 --> 25:10.958
This fiddle player will be hungry...

25:11.033 --> 25:12.728
...famished, starved.

25:12.801 --> 25:16.237
His last meal was twelve hours ago.

25:16.304 --> 25:17.635
This boy's on the run.

25:17.706 --> 25:20.004
He'll head for the city,
a large city.

25:20.075 --> 25:22.339
He'll try to lose himself in a crowd.

25:22.411 --> 25:26.370
And wherever he goes, he will feel
hundreds of eyes staring his way.

25:26.448 --> 25:28.848
No matter what he does,
no matter where he goes...

25:28.917 --> 25:30.179
...he will feel hunted.

25:30.252 --> 25:31.514
And my friends...

25:31.586 --> 25:34.248
...you are looking at the hunter!

25:34.322 --> 25:36.313
I want roadblocks
around a 10-mile radius.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.518
Set up communications
with all law enforcement.

25:38.593 --> 25:40.686
That's state, county, city!

25:40.762 --> 25:43.663
Get me Governor Carlson.
I may need the National Guard.

25:43.732 --> 25:45.359
Diet Coke, no ice.

25:45.434 --> 25:48.028
All right, people.
I want Harrison caught...

25:48.103 --> 25:50.435
...in 4 hours and 28 minutes.

25:50.505 --> 25:53.440
That will make it exactly high noon.
Now let's move it!

25:53.508 --> 25:57.171
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Move it, people! Move it!

26:05.587 --> 26:08.715
Nelson and I are heading towards Wysetta
by way of Peck's Woods.

26:08.790 --> 26:11.281
So far, no sign of Harrison. Over.

26:11.359 --> 26:13.259
Ten-four, Unit Six.

26:56.671 --> 26:58.104
How you doing there?

26:58.173 --> 26:59.265
Fine.

26:59.341 --> 27:02.174
These are on sale, right?

27:02.244 --> 27:05.179
Sure, yeah.
$32.50, okay?

27:05.247 --> 27:07.272
You betcha, sure.

27:09.684 --> 27:11.174
Doing some fishing around here?

27:11.653 --> 27:13.450
Yes.

27:13.522 --> 27:16.616
I'm going to do a little angling,
see if I can't catch one of those...

27:16.691 --> 27:21.094
uh, bigmouth fish here in Minnesota.

27:21.163 --> 27:24.599
And some of those huge huskies, too.

27:31.907 --> 27:32.965
So, Roman...

27:33.041 --> 27:34.975
...are you still fishing off Gray's Bay?

27:35.043 --> 27:39.207
Catching any walleyes,
muskies or enemy boats?

27:39.281 --> 27:41.146
Sure, you betcha.

27:41.216 --> 27:43.946
I told you that upteen times.

27:44.019 --> 27:47.455
A guy in a rubber-type boat was headed
for the Goodhue place, you know?

27:47.522 --> 27:49.490
Yeah, sure, yeah.

27:49.558 --> 27:51.185
Okay then?

27:51.259 --> 27:53.227
Sure, after how many beers?

27:53.295 --> 27:56.958
I ain't touched a drop of liquor
since I quit singing with ABBA.

27:57.032 --> 28:00.661
Was that the night of
the Hibbing Goodhue murder?

28:00.735 --> 28:03.670
- You seem awful interested in this case.
- No.

28:03.738 --> 28:06.332
- Do you know something about the Goodhue killing?
- No.

28:06.408 --> 28:09.070
- Do you have any real stories to tell us?
- No.

28:09.144 --> 28:12.341
I'll take the rod
and write a check here.

28:12.414 --> 28:14.348
You have a pen?

28:14.416 --> 28:16.475
Thank you.

28:24.860 --> 28:27.294
Yeah, sure enough. You betcha. Okay.

28:30.632 --> 28:34.193
You know, I've never seen you
around here, Mr...

28:34.269 --> 28:35.998
Buzzin.

28:36.071 --> 28:37.732
Buzzin Frog.

28:37.806 --> 28:41.936
Born on the shores
of the Euro Larvae River in Rapala.

28:42.010 --> 28:44.376
Couple of husky jerks...

28:44.446 --> 28:46.744
...brought me to Slimy Slug,
South Dakota.

28:46.815 --> 28:48.874
Up there by Timber Doodle?

28:48.950 --> 28:52.044
The Zebco brothers, Smithwick...

28:52.120 --> 28:54.054
...and Salty Dog Shrimp--

28:54.122 --> 28:55.783
Ohh!

28:55.857 --> 28:59.054
I can't go fishing this afternoon.

28:59.127 --> 29:01.595
I've got a big meeting over at...

29:01.663 --> 29:03.858
...Menzrum.

29:03.932 --> 29:08.096
I'd forget my genitals if they weren't
SuperGlued in between my legs.

29:08.169 --> 29:09.227
Water-skiing accident.

29:14.142 --> 29:15.404
Freeze, Harrison!

29:15.477 --> 29:16.910
Don't move.

29:28.523 --> 29:31.083
You know, I've never seen you
around here, Mr...

29:31.927 --> 29:32.916
Buzzin.

29:32.994 --> 29:34.586
Buzzin Frog.

29:34.663 --> 29:37.257
Born on the shores
of the Euro Larvae River...

29:37.332 --> 29:38.765
...in Rapala.

29:38.833 --> 29:41.097
Up there by Timber Doodle?

29:41.169 --> 29:43.262
...Salty Dog Shrimp.

29:43.338 --> 29:46.171
I've got a big meeting
over at Menzrum.

30:50.705 --> 30:52.502
There's got to be something here...

30:52.574 --> 30:54.474
...some clue, somewhere.

31:25.373 --> 31:27.307
- Ryan.
- What are you doing here?

31:27.375 --> 31:29.343
- How did you get in?
- The door was open.

31:29.411 --> 31:31.038
I locked that door.

31:31.112 --> 31:32.272
A key.

31:32.347 --> 31:36.283
Lauren is missing. She gave you a key,
sent you to do evidence housecleaning.

31:36.351 --> 31:38.376
No, I painted Hibbing's portrait.

31:38.453 --> 31:40.887
He gave me this key to let myself in.

31:40.955 --> 31:43.423
I have no idea where Lauren is.
The killer could be stalking her.

31:43.491 --> 31:46.688
Stalking, schmalking. She lied
about me on the witness stand.

31:46.761 --> 31:48.786
She set me up to come here
the night of the murder.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.296
She couldn't do anything like that.

31:50.365 --> 31:52.629
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.
She dida!

31:52.700 --> 31:56.796
I understand her.
You see, I think she's my sister.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.099
Sister?

31:58.173 --> 32:00.539
It's like a brother,
only you do each other's hair.

32:00.608 --> 32:03.702
I think she's in grave danger.
I came to look for clues.

32:03.778 --> 32:06.804
Ryan, I know you're innocent.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.576
You really mean that?

32:08.650 --> 32:10.413
This is not just
another way to meet guys?

32:11.486 --> 32:13.044
I'm a friend.

32:14.489 --> 32:16.582
I wish that we could be friends.

32:18.827 --> 32:21.057
But women and me...

32:21.129 --> 32:23.222
...are like water and fire--

32:23.298 --> 32:26.165
Wet and flammable.

32:26.234 --> 32:27.496
No, no.

32:32.006 --> 32:34.236
You hang out with me...

32:34.309 --> 32:36.004
...and you're going to get hurt.

32:36.077 --> 32:37.669
No.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.345
It was all mine.

32:40.415 --> 32:43.179
The city was at my feet,
spread out like an oyster.

32:43.251 --> 32:45.617
People bravoed, they ovated.

32:45.687 --> 32:48.178
I was somebody,
I was a contender.

32:48.256 --> 32:51.692
Now all I've got
is a one-way ticket to Palookaville.

32:51.759 --> 32:54.751
It's got to be that the answer
is here somewhere.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.164
The party...

32:57.232 --> 32:58.859
...drinks, drinking...

32:59.534 --> 33:01.593
...the bar.

33:01.669 --> 33:03.660
There was something
about the bartender.

33:03.738 --> 33:04.670
Close your eyes.

33:10.044 --> 33:12.012
The bartender!

33:12.080 --> 33:13.138
Hibbing's killer!

33:20.622 --> 33:22.055
You...

33:22.123 --> 33:23.147
...with the killer.

33:26.561 --> 33:27.994
Good Lord!

33:35.303 --> 33:37.703
The bus stop at Helm's
is the 5:50 express.

33:37.772 --> 33:39.740
It stops right in front
of the Goodhue house.

33:39.807 --> 33:41.138
Scour the entire area.

33:41.209 --> 33:43.370
Orono, chase the car
and put it in park.

33:43.444 --> 33:45.810
Bagley, I want everyone interrogated.

33:45.880 --> 33:50.180
I want surnames, last names,
given names, confirmation names.

33:50.251 --> 33:52.515
Give me photo analysis,
footprint analysis...

33:52.587 --> 33:54.521
...DNA, bra sizes.

33:54.589 --> 33:56.250
I'll check out
who belongs to this truck.

33:56.324 --> 33:59.191
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

34:17.478 --> 34:20.447
I need a backup unit,
a roadblock and a helicopter.

34:22.483 --> 34:23.677
Harrison?

34:25.018 --> 34:26.748
Where's that gardener?

34:26.821 --> 34:27.810
Bagley!

34:27.889 --> 34:28.821
Orono!

34:43.605 --> 34:44.536
That's our man!

34:54.081 --> 34:55.572
She meant to do that.

34:55.650 --> 34:56.581
Women.

35:02.824 --> 35:04.382
We got us a gopher.

35:07.895 --> 35:09.954
I'll see where this thing comes out.

35:12.834 --> 35:14.267
Call the Department of Water--

35:47.235 --> 35:48.668
Hey!

36:38.319 --> 36:39.684
Hands up!

36:44.792 --> 36:46.817
It's over, Harrison.

36:46.894 --> 36:48.327
But I'm innocent.

36:48.396 --> 36:51.490
The one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed man.
The bartender.

36:51.566 --> 36:52.931
He was the one
who killed Hibbing Goodhue.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.662
And Lauren Goodhue is working with him.
Why, I don't know.

36:55.737 --> 36:57.364
- Why?
- I don't know!

36:57.438 --> 36:59.599
But I'll find them. I've got clues.
I've got a map.

36:59.674 --> 37:02.165
I've got the name, "Hylander,"
and a rubber boat.

37:02.243 --> 37:04.211
They prove I've been wrongfully accused!

37:04.278 --> 37:07.247
Nice tune,
but I didn't come here to dance.

37:07.315 --> 37:09.283
You've been convicted of murder.

37:09.984 --> 37:11.383
I'm taking you in.

37:11.452 --> 37:12.942
No!

37:13.020 --> 37:14.385
I'm not going back.

37:14.455 --> 37:15.513
Wherever it is!

37:20.261 --> 37:21.455
Wait, Harrison!

37:23.765 --> 37:25.733
Man in the water!

37:56.297 --> 37:58.492
Ooh! Cold, cold!

38:03.905 --> 38:07.807
What the hell is all that rubber boat
and "Hylander" stuff about?

38:07.875 --> 38:10.571
Orono, call the coast guard.
"Hylander."

38:17.718 --> 38:20.084
Well!

38:20.154 --> 38:22.122
Peekaboo, baby!

38:22.190 --> 38:23.452
Don't move.

38:26.227 --> 38:27.990
I've got a gun.

38:28.062 --> 38:29.086
Not here...

38:29.163 --> 38:30.255
...but I got one.

38:30.331 --> 38:31.593
You frightened?

38:31.666 --> 38:33.964
You ran away, you remember?
You can move now.

38:34.035 --> 38:35.263
Yes, I was frightened.

38:35.336 --> 38:37.463
I've been driving all over the city
searching for you.

38:37.538 --> 38:39.597
Well, you found me.
Hide-and-seek is over.

38:39.674 --> 38:42.370
The school bell has rung.
Time to go back to the homeroom.

38:42.443 --> 38:44.502
Whatever you do, don't scream.

38:44.579 --> 38:46.444
Aaah!

38:46.514 --> 38:47.708
Like that.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.227
Ryan...

39:07.301 --> 39:09.064
...you can feel safe here.

39:09.136 --> 39:10.865
We're six floors up.
No one can see you.

39:10.938 --> 39:13.498
Hey, Cass!
Who's your new friend?

39:19.914 --> 39:21.711
Sit down, Pancakes.

39:27.121 --> 39:29.419
Of all the women in all the world...

39:29.490 --> 39:32.084
...you had to walk into mine.

39:34.428 --> 39:37.522
I'm sure if we just talk all night,
we can work this out.

39:37.598 --> 39:39.532
Sure, Slappy.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.569
Let's pull out that wad of cotton
and get right to the aspirin.

39:42.637 --> 39:45.401
You hired a hit man.
You wanted Hibbing dead.

39:45.473 --> 39:47.031
I saw the two of you arguing.

39:47.108 --> 39:50.168
And you were sizzling
like a wiener on a hibachi.

39:50.244 --> 39:53.236
That's because Hibbing told me that
he hated the portrait I did of him.

39:53.314 --> 39:54.576
It hurt.

39:54.649 --> 39:58.050
A deep, crampy kind of a hurt.
That's why I was so upset.

39:58.119 --> 39:59.552
I was even going to kill myself.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.781
But I couldn't.
I threw the gun in the bay.

40:01.856 --> 40:04.757
We don't have time
for this schoolgirl act.

40:04.825 --> 40:07.385
We're, both of us,
sitting under the gallows.

40:07.461 --> 40:10.760
You're not telling the truth! Explain
why you gave the killer the money.

40:10.831 --> 40:12.298
That was Hibbing's money
for the portrait.

40:12.366 --> 40:14.425
I gave it to the bartender
to give back to Hibbing.

40:14.502 --> 40:16.197
I never wanted to see Hibbing again.

40:16.270 --> 40:17.897
Your lies are like bananas.

40:17.972 --> 40:20.440
They come in big yellow bunches.

40:20.508 --> 40:23.238
I wish there was something
I could do to make you believe me.

40:41.929 --> 40:42.861
Damn you!

40:43.664 --> 40:47.122
Damn you for making me
fall in love with you.

40:47.201 --> 40:49.931
- I can't let you get mixed up in this.
- I want to get mixed up in it.

40:50.004 --> 40:51.972
- I can't do it to you.
- I want you to do it to me.

40:52.039 --> 40:53.267
I'm a hunted man.

40:53.341 --> 40:56.276
Every time I think that I'm out,
they pull me back in.

40:56.344 --> 40:57.641
Hunt me! Pull me!

40:57.712 --> 40:59.441
Ryan, you can't do this on your own.

40:59.513 --> 41:00.639
I have to.

41:00.715 --> 41:01.943
Now, listen...

41:02.016 --> 41:03.449
...I'm going out that door...

41:03.517 --> 41:04.984
...and where I'm going
you can't follow me.

41:05.052 --> 41:06.917
And I'm not trying to be noble.

41:06.988 --> 41:09.354
But baby, out there...

41:09.423 --> 41:11.152
...it's a hill of beans.

41:11.225 --> 41:13.318
Here's looking at you, kid.

41:13.394 --> 41:15.021
You're the stuff dreams are made of.

41:16.998 --> 41:17.965
You see?

41:18.032 --> 41:19.624
You're exhausted.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.689
Listen...

41:20.768 --> 41:22.360
...I'm going to give you
a sponge bath...

41:22.436 --> 41:24.597
...give you a bracing enema
and make you something to eat.

41:24.672 --> 41:28.130
Just put your weight on me.
I'll take you into the bedroom.

41:28.209 --> 41:30.177
An enema?

43:00.034 --> 43:02.832
It's nervous time. Time is running out.
We got a fast break.

43:02.903 --> 43:05.701
- He's blocked from entering the lane.

43:05.773 --> 43:08.742
Yo-yoing up and down.
Up and down, up and down!

43:08.809 --> 43:10.071
He checks the clock.
Time is running out.

43:10.144 --> 43:11.771
He's been in the paint for a long time.

43:11.846 --> 43:13.370
He's going for it.

43:13.447 --> 43:16.439
Shoots off the iron, rebound,
put it up. It's dangling on the rim.

43:16.517 --> 43:18.246
No, yes, no, yes, no.

43:18.319 --> 43:19.911
Rebound. He's going for it.

43:19.987 --> 43:21.284
The mustard's off the hot dog.

43:21.355 --> 43:23.380
Another rebound.
No harm, no foul.

43:23.457 --> 43:24.549
He pumps up a long one.

43:24.625 --> 43:26.252
Nothing but net. Oh, yes!

43:26.327 --> 43:29.023
He scores! This one's in the
refrigerator. The door is closed.

43:29.096 --> 43:30.427
The lights are out,
the eggs are cooling.

43:30.498 --> 43:33.058
The butter's getting hard
and the Jell-O is jiggling!

43:33.134 --> 43:36.433
A picnicker said she saw a man
wet and dripping walk this way.

43:36.504 --> 43:39.302
Well, gather up all these leaves
for trace evidence.

43:39.373 --> 43:41.500
Shoot and gut
every animal in the park.

43:41.575 --> 43:44.408
Their stomachs might contain something
that could be a clue.

43:44.478 --> 43:45.672
Donate the meat to charity.

43:45.746 --> 43:48.772
The hides can be turned into
warm socks for the poor.

43:48.849 --> 43:50.646
Grind up the bones for dog food.

43:50.718 --> 43:52.276
I want nothing wasted.

43:52.353 --> 43:54.446
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Here we are.

43:54.522 --> 43:56.956
A man's footprint...

43:57.024 --> 43:59.857
...the depth of the print indicating
the weight and the height of Harrison.

44:00.761 --> 44:02.786
Tire tracks.

44:02.863 --> 44:07.129
Tire tracks of the kind found in
the classic Mercedes-Benz convertible.

44:07.201 --> 44:09.192
The car of choice...

44:09.270 --> 44:12.330
...for a bright,
young professional woman.

44:13.174 --> 44:15.142
An artist...

44:15.209 --> 44:17.803
...maybe a photographer, painter.

44:17.878 --> 44:20.312
A woman with a mysterious past.

44:20.381 --> 44:23.544
A woman who is looking for someone.

44:25.519 --> 44:27.043
I can feel it.

44:27.121 --> 44:30.056
I'm as sure about that as I am that
that's an anaconda.

44:33.961 --> 44:37.328
That woman that cut us off in the
Mercedes, that fits her to a tee.

44:37.398 --> 44:39.332
License number 381 JPL.

44:41.235 --> 44:42.998
Davy Crockett died for our sins.

44:43.070 --> 44:45.630
Harrison's had somebody
helping him all along!

44:45.706 --> 44:48.004
Call Motor Vehicles.
Get her address.

44:48.075 --> 44:50.305
- We'll pick her up.
- No. No.

44:50.377 --> 44:52.572
There are better ways
to find out what a woman knows.

44:52.646 --> 44:55.513
Dinner and a movie, lie to her,
say you love her.

44:55.583 --> 44:58.347
That works, but in this case
we're going to stake out her place.

44:58.419 --> 45:00.717
She's going to lead us
to Ryan Harrison.

45:02.189 --> 45:04.851
Bagley!

45:04.925 --> 45:07.826
Wait, I'm coming.
Hey, guys!

45:21.308 --> 45:24.368
Henningsen and Sachs
presents Old People on Ice.

45:24.445 --> 45:27.539
Now through November
at the Marnie Ice Arena.

45:31.919 --> 45:34.888
Good afternoon, I'm Ruth Kimball
with your hometown news.

45:34.955 --> 45:39.551
For 36 hours, Ryan Harrison,
murderer, all-around big dink...

45:39.627 --> 45:41.026
has been a fugitive.

45:41.095 --> 45:44.258
Lieutenant Fergus Falls
is heading the worldwide manhunt.

45:44.331 --> 45:48.768
Police helicopters, dogs, psychics
and thousands of police are involved.

45:48.836 --> 45:52.203
Plus millions of average citizens
who would give their left nut...

45:52.273 --> 45:54.707
...to collect the $50,000 reward.

45:54.775 --> 45:56.800
And who couldn't
use a bit of extra money?

45:56.877 --> 46:00.904
A couple on a fixed income, a teacher,
especially a struggling artist...

46:00.981 --> 46:04.576
...who had to return a large fee
because someone hated her portrait.

46:04.652 --> 46:07.086
I personally
wouldn't trust someone like that...

46:07.154 --> 46:10.089
...for a million, billion,
trillion dollars.

46:11.659 --> 46:13.286
The Columbia Heights Jamboree...

46:13.360 --> 46:14.588
...is shaping--

46:38.719 --> 46:41.244
I'm on the 6th floor,
apartment 602.

46:41.822 --> 46:42.789
What?

46:42.856 --> 46:44.915
No, he's alone.

46:53.267 --> 46:54.928
Well.

47:13.287 --> 47:14.777
Well, well!

47:22.396 --> 47:23.829
No, you don't understand.

47:23.897 --> 47:26.297
This can't wait.
This has to happen right now.

48:00.667 --> 48:02.862
Sean Laughrea.

48:02.936 --> 48:04.699
Hibbing's killer.

48:20.087 --> 48:22.715
Yes. Thank you.

48:24.591 --> 48:26.889
Harrison! Open up!
We know you're in there!

48:27.628 --> 48:28.617
It's the police!

48:30.631 --> 48:32.030
Don't go in there!

48:32.099 --> 48:33.930
- What are you doing?
- Harrison!

48:35.536 --> 48:37.060
Ryan, open up!

48:37.137 --> 48:38.195
I've got a gun!

48:39.273 --> 48:40.205
Come on!

48:40.274 --> 48:41.468
Ryan!

48:41.542 --> 48:43.476
Let me in! Right now!

48:46.080 --> 48:47.012
Come out!

48:48.148 --> 48:49.877
Is that my toilet? Ryan!

48:50.818 --> 48:51.614
Open up!

48:52.486 --> 48:54.477
You'll never get away, Ryan!

48:57.391 --> 48:59.757
- Ryan!
- Whoa!

49:01.995 --> 49:03.485
Starting to give!

49:18.178 --> 49:20.612
Aaaah!

49:27.688 --> 49:28.655
Go!

49:31.992 --> 49:33.186
All right, my angels...

49:33.260 --> 49:34.192
...move!

49:37.698 --> 49:39.825
- Patio clear!
- Ivy needs water!

49:39.900 --> 49:40.889
Den is clear!

49:40.968 --> 49:42.026
I got spaghetti!

49:42.102 --> 49:44.093
Watch it!
Plate could be hot!

49:44.938 --> 49:46.132
I got a shut door!

49:47.307 --> 49:48.774
Empty.

49:48.842 --> 49:51.538
We throw a shoe
every time we start to gallop.

49:51.612 --> 49:53.773
That man's as slick as a lizard
in Jerry Lewis' hair.

49:55.549 --> 49:57.540
Cass Lake,
face of an angel.

49:57.618 --> 49:59.711
Harrison's accomplice.

49:59.786 --> 50:02.016
A caterpillar has 2,087
minute hairs on each leg.

50:02.089 --> 50:04.649
But for the life of me, I cannot
tell you why women keep falling...

50:04.725 --> 50:06.716
...for the wrong man.

50:06.793 --> 50:08.852
All right, people!
Tag and log everything.

50:08.929 --> 50:11.022
I want carpet fibers.
I want wallpaper swatches.

50:11.098 --> 50:13.157
I want all plumbing
and wood surfaces analyzed.

50:13.233 --> 50:16.202
So vacuum, cut,
chip and suck!

50:17.137 --> 50:19.537
There are two things
that frost my butt:

50:19.606 --> 50:21.506
It's a snow cone
about that high...

50:21.575 --> 50:23.839
...and the other one
is Ryan Harrison.

50:24.745 --> 50:26.576
I don't hear it, people!

51:44.791 --> 51:47.419
- Pediatrics is down the street.
- Thank you.

52:07.547 --> 52:11.779
Dr. Kimball to surgery,
please. Dr. Kimball.

52:12.853 --> 52:14.286
Dr. Kevorkian.

52:14.354 --> 52:17.585
Dr. Kevorkian to Mr. Simpson's room.

52:24.164 --> 52:26.291
A volcano has erupted!

52:26.366 --> 52:27.628
Tornado!

52:27.701 --> 52:28.633
Earthquake!

52:28.702 --> 52:29.964
It's El Nino!

52:30.037 --> 52:31.129
Killer bees!

52:31.204 --> 52:33.672
An ocean liner hit an iceberg!

52:35.375 --> 52:38.970
Thank God you're here,
Doctor...Sanchez.

52:39.046 --> 52:42.038
Because of cutbacks,
you are the only person on duty.

52:45.218 --> 52:47.152
He's pregnant.

52:47.220 --> 52:48.949
Doctor, this man's been shot 5 times.

52:49.022 --> 52:51.422
Down at the end
in the 10-Bullets-or-Less lane.

52:51.491 --> 52:53.288
I'll adjust that.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.225
Maximum flow.

52:56.930 --> 52:59.296
Doctor, you'd better
take a look at this.

52:59.366 --> 53:01.129
Uh, no, thank you.

53:01.201 --> 53:04.136
Administer 200,000
units of adrenaline.

53:04.204 --> 53:05.535
- But--
- Damn your "but."

53:05.605 --> 53:08.335
I said 200,000 cc's of adrenaline.

53:10.277 --> 53:11.904
Balance and rotate the organs.

53:12.746 --> 53:13.838
Put granny on the gurney.

53:13.914 --> 53:15.905
Put the cop in post-op.

53:15.982 --> 53:17.847
- ICU?
- And I see you.

53:17.918 --> 53:20.386
You're a fine nurse.

53:20.454 --> 53:22.012
I want to speak to you.

53:22.089 --> 53:24.023
Isn't that a little fester?

53:24.091 --> 53:25.718
- What?
- Just below your eye there.

53:25.792 --> 53:28.727
- Fester? ls it dangerous?
- Let me get a good look at that.

53:43.558 --> 53:47.085
Check in, Second Floor Security.
Check in, please, Jackson.

53:47.162 --> 53:50.563
I'm searching the west wing.
So far, no sign of the intruder.

54:27.202 --> 54:29.670
Nurse! Nurse!

54:30.271 --> 54:31.499
Hold it!

54:35.376 --> 54:36.866
Quick!

54:36.945 --> 54:40.312
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

54:53.795 --> 54:55.888
- Security, look behind you.
- What?

54:55.964 --> 54:57.864
- Look behind you.
- Where?

54:57.932 --> 54:59.661
Look behind you.

54:59.734 --> 55:02.669
Oh. Too late.
Go to Radiology.

55:04.572 --> 55:06.199
We should be safe for now.

55:06.274 --> 55:07.639
I followed the diaper truck.

55:07.709 --> 55:09.870
As soon as I saw this hospital,
I knew you must be here.

55:09.944 --> 55:11.206
Put your hand in my pocket.

55:11.279 --> 55:12.837
All right.

55:12.914 --> 55:14.176
What am I looking for?

55:14.249 --> 55:15.580
Nothing.

55:15.650 --> 55:19.051
I just missed you, baby.
We're going to party like it's 1995.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.985
Oh, Ryan.

55:21.055 --> 55:23.319
I hoped you'd say those words.

55:23.391 --> 55:24.858
I love you.

55:27.328 --> 55:28.488
Boy!

55:28.563 --> 55:30.724
You really are something,
aren't you?

55:30.799 --> 55:33.700
You believed me just then, didn't you?
How does it feel?

55:33.768 --> 55:36.737
You were lit up
like Dennis Rodman at Christmastime.

55:36.805 --> 55:37.999
You really are good!

55:40.241 --> 55:42.436
I do love you, Ryan.
I truly do.

55:42.510 --> 55:44.341
And you eat with that mouth?

55:44.412 --> 55:46.039
The Beatles said it best:

55:46.114 --> 55:47.877
"She loves you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah."

55:47.949 --> 55:49.416
Listen, Michelle, my belle...

55:49.484 --> 55:52.214
...this nowhere man is the walrus.
Kookookachoo.

55:53.154 --> 55:55.554
Up at the apartment,
you said you thought I was innocent.

55:55.623 --> 55:58.285
But then visions
of a big fat reward...

55:58.359 --> 56:01.294
...danced through your head
like sugarplums on steroids.

56:01.362 --> 56:03.057
You made a call,
you got a gat...

56:03.131 --> 56:04.962
...and you sicced Johnny Law on me.

56:05.033 --> 56:06.933
You're just a big bully,
aren't you?

56:07.001 --> 56:08.628
That gun was for your protection.

56:08.703 --> 56:12.571
I called the airlines to get you
a plane to South America, you mean man.

56:12.640 --> 56:15.700
I wish I had a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese every time I heard that chestnut.

56:15.777 --> 56:19.440
This little nutcracker is not dancing
to your suite anymore, princess.

56:19.514 --> 56:21.812
I found Lauren's letters to Sean
in your apartment.

56:21.883 --> 56:23.248
Explain that!

56:24.152 --> 56:27.053
Lauren knew Sean for a long time.
You knew that.

56:27.121 --> 56:29.089
You knew she knew him.

56:29.157 --> 56:30.419
Yes, I knew she knew.

56:30.491 --> 56:32.083
Netenyahu?

56:32.160 --> 56:33.889
I knew Lauren knew Sean.

56:33.962 --> 56:36.260
All right, the truth at last!

56:36.331 --> 56:39.960
Oh, Ryan.
They're the only family I have.

56:40.034 --> 56:43.470
Please don't make me choose
between you and my family.

56:43.538 --> 56:45.438
Family?
Lauren's your sister. And?

56:45.506 --> 56:47.098
Sean is my brother.

56:47.175 --> 56:48.301
Forgive me.

56:52.580 --> 56:56.607
Dr. Ross, Dr. Green, Dr. Carter,
Dr. Weaver and Dr. Benton...

56:56.684 --> 57:00.245
...please pick up
a very large check in the ER.

57:03.658 --> 57:06.684
A man fitting Harrison's description
and wearing a meat company shirt...

57:06.761 --> 57:08.285
...has entered the ER.

57:08.363 --> 57:10.354
There are 1,400 beds...

57:10.431 --> 57:13.696
...a staff of 250,
150 individual rooms.

57:13.768 --> 57:15.963
Chances of our finding
Cass and Harrison right off...

57:16.037 --> 57:18.665
...are 9,103 to 5.

57:18.740 --> 57:20.867
It is 3:05 p.m.

57:20.942 --> 57:23.137
We should make contact in 14 minutes...

57:23.211 --> 57:24.769
...which makes it exactly...

57:24.846 --> 57:27.474
...3:19 p.m.
Let's do it.

57:38.960 --> 57:41.190
Records room. Records room.

57:45.466 --> 57:47.457
Access denied.

57:49.570 --> 57:51.060
Air conditioning duct.

57:51.139 --> 57:53.573
Aha.

57:53.641 --> 57:55.336
Let's see here.

58:24.238 --> 58:26.365
- Uh, Nurse Anderson.
- Yes, Doctor?

59:13.721 --> 59:15.154
Thank you.

01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.459
Let me see--
Aaaah!

01:01:02.997 --> 01:01:04.259
Shalom!

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:10.936
Dr. Fridley?

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:13.605
Sit down.

01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:18.711
Here it is.

01:01:18.779 --> 01:01:20.872
It's a beauty.

01:01:20.948 --> 01:01:22.813
It's a work of art.

01:01:22.884 --> 01:01:26.047
The barrel is
a lightweight titanium alloy.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.850
A retractable Swiss laser scope.

01:01:28.923 --> 01:01:32.552
A Rogers Palomino trigger,
self-cleaning pump action...

01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:34.561
...ribbed for your pleasure.

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:36.895
A silencer.

01:01:38.266 --> 01:01:39.198
A Hush Puppy.

01:02:03.925 --> 01:02:05.085
Main Menu.

01:02:13.034 --> 01:02:14.592
Searching.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:17.596
Print?

01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:22.635
Thank you. How are you today?
Getting any?

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.716
Good, he's taken the bait.

01:03:51.732 --> 01:03:54.462
Just give me a second!
I'm almost done!

01:04:00.074 --> 01:04:01.541
Go, go, go!

01:04:29.704 --> 01:04:33.401
We'll lead him to the cornfield.
Then we'll kill him.

01:07:19.106 --> 01:07:20.698
Cass.

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:26.604
This is some kind of trap,
isn't it?

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.773
Just like your sister
the night Hibbing was murdered.

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:32.080
- I want you to understand something.
- I understand everything, Luscious.

01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:35.918
I saw through your lies
like Spam in a Ziploc bag.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:37.890
I wish I could forget all this
and go away together.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:40.392
We can go away right now.
I pack light.

01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:42.486
Everything we need
is right here in my pants.

01:07:42.563 --> 01:07:45.794
Listen to me.
I was abandoned as a child.

01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:48.630
I never knew my mother,
my father, my dog.

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:51.102
Yeah, pretty words,
Baby Crackers.

01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:54.800
Your Popeil Pasta Maker
is spewing out fettucini full of lies.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:56.934
Well, well.
What do we have here?

01:07:57.011 --> 01:08:00.606
Lookit. Something even the cat
wouldn't have drug in.

01:08:00.681 --> 01:08:03.172
Pull up a bucket of nightmares
and sit down.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.413
I've had enough of you.
It's time to dispose of Ryan Harrison...

01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:08.580
...the way I killed my dear,
late husband.

01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:12.217
I should have guessed that you did it,
but I didn't.

01:08:12.293 --> 01:08:14.284
Oh.
Sean Laughrea.

01:08:14.361 --> 01:08:16.795
What a happy, big-time family reunion.

01:08:16.863 --> 01:08:19.731
You make the Mansons
look like the Cleavers.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.529
Family? Us? Me?

01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:23.466
Yes.

01:08:23.537 --> 01:08:25.698
I'm your sister.
Lauren's our mother.

01:08:25.773 --> 01:08:28.970
I'm your mother's identical twin,
born ten years apart but identical.

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:31.876
I killed your mother. Penis envy.
She was a hermaphrodite.

01:08:31.946 --> 01:08:33.880
Mom was my mother and my father?

01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:35.346
Sean's adopted.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:38.544
I dated your real father
but chose the life of a freedom fighter.

01:08:38.618 --> 01:08:42.715
Well, Miss Thick Bubbly Lips, I found
out about Dr. Fridley prosthetic leg.

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:48.057
One carbon steel barrel,
magazine of cyanide-tipped bullets.

01:08:48.127 --> 01:08:51.120
Nice new weapon. Right, Sean?
Signal "yes"...

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:53.223
...by shooting yourself
in the head 3 times.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.291
Don't. It's a trick.

01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:57.929
Very smart, Harrison,
but this is where smart ends...

01:08:58.005 --> 01:09:00.200
...and dead begins.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:01.741
You die.

01:09:16.523 --> 01:09:20.720
Ruth, as you can see, the U.N. Secretary
General, Sir Robert McKintyre...

01:09:20.794 --> 01:09:22.125
...has arrived in Columbia Heights...

01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:23.356
There's our target.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:26.024
You killed Hibbing and now McKintyre?

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.624
I can't believe it.

01:09:27.701 --> 01:09:31.398
I hope what I just told you won't
keep you from carrying out our mission.

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:35.573
McKintyre is an enemy
to every freedom fighter on this planet.

01:09:35.643 --> 01:09:37.372
Yes, of course.

01:09:37.444 --> 01:09:39.571
I see you're right.

01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:42.548
Good. Let's go.

01:09:42.616 --> 01:09:46.984
I'll just finish packing the terrorists'
lunches and I'll be right there.

01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:49.488
See you in five?

01:09:53.426 --> 01:09:54.860
Cass!

01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:58.130
Cass!

01:10:10.411 --> 01:10:12.345
Cass. Shh.

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:19.444
When you shot me at point-blank range
I knew you loved me.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.616
Those trophies back at your apartment--
You're a crack shot.

01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:27.422
I checked myself for holes.
There were just the usual ones.

01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:29.485
You tricked them.
You were using blanks, right?

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:33.465
Yes. I had to shoot you, Ryan.
Otherwise, they would have murdered you.

01:10:33.534 --> 01:10:36.935
After searching for my family,
I discovered they're terrorists.

01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:38.699
And now they're trying
to kill my father.

01:10:38.772 --> 01:10:39.966
Your father?

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.204
Yes. I just found out my father is
the Secretary General of the U.N.

01:10:44.278 --> 01:10:47.941
Right. Two can play at that game.
We'll set a trap. You stay here.

01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:50.711
If they change their plans,
you get the word out right away.

01:10:52.019 --> 01:10:54.886
If they realize I'm pretending to be
one of them, they may try to kill me.

01:10:54.955 --> 01:10:58.186
That's a chance I'll have to take.
Good luck.

01:10:59.927 --> 01:11:01.394
Hmm.

01:11:12.172 --> 01:11:15.539
The Columbia Heights Jamboree
is proud to welcome...

01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:17.474
...Mayor John Stopka...

01:11:17.544 --> 01:11:22.675
...and United Nations Secretary General,
Sir Robert McKintyre.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:26.584
Sir Robert, right after the drill team
you can begin your speech.

01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:27.915
Thank you, Mayor Stopka.

01:12:39.026 --> 01:12:40.152
Ohh!

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:23.264
Look out!
He's got a leg!

01:13:54.868 --> 01:13:56.495
Ryan!

01:13:59.206 --> 01:14:01.697
Oh, shit!

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:03.402
- Cass!
- Ryan!

01:14:03.477 --> 01:14:05.411
- Come on, hurry. This way.
- All right, sir, this way.

01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:08.676
- Come on, Daddy. Come with me.
- Daddy?

01:14:11.885 --> 01:14:14.683
Ohh!

01:14:14.755 --> 01:14:16.586
Get in! Get in!

01:14:23.697 --> 01:14:25.187
Get in the bloody van!

01:14:25.265 --> 01:14:27.529
Plan "B" a go.
"B" a go.

01:14:27.601 --> 01:14:30.764
It's Ryan, the bastard!
And McKintyre's with him.

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.040
Ryan, look out!

01:14:50.123 --> 01:14:54.116
Oh, my God, it's Sean!
He's got a gun! Go, go, go, go!

01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:06.571
Kill him!

01:15:13.146 --> 01:15:14.875
Oh, no! A stinger!

01:15:17.651 --> 01:15:18.777
Get back!

01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:19.944
What a day!

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.062
Let's go!

01:15:35.035 --> 01:15:36.024
That van over there!

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.805
My gun! Come on.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.399
Quick! Over there.

01:15:43.477 --> 01:15:45.604
Move it. Quick now!

01:15:48.582 --> 01:15:51.574
Move it. Quick now!
Get down! Keep down!

01:15:51.651 --> 01:15:53.243
Quickly!
Get down! Get down!

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.847
There's plenty of room in there!
Get in there! Move it, move it!

01:16:50.577 --> 01:16:51.737
Damn!

01:16:53.613 --> 01:16:54.705
Come on!

01:16:58.885 --> 01:17:01.183
Drop your guns!
Drop 'em!

01:17:01.254 --> 01:17:02.983
What?

01:17:03.056 --> 01:17:04.182
Give 'em up!

01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:41.191
- Hey. Nice work.
- Good one.

01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:44.392
Stay with me, people!

01:17:48.969 --> 01:17:50.368
Laughrea!

01:17:55.609 --> 01:17:57.702
Fergus Falls,
here's the one-armed...

01:17:57.777 --> 01:18:01.076
...one-legged, one-eyed man!

01:18:01.148 --> 01:18:03.912
Are you frightened, punk?

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:05.747
Did I fire the last bullet...

01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:07.946
...or is there is another one
in the chamber...

01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:09.386
...with your name on it?

01:18:09.456 --> 01:18:12.755
Does the thought of death
play with your mind?

01:18:12.826 --> 01:18:13.793
Punk?

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.225
Do you...

01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:17.263
...gots to know?

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.230
Well...

01:18:19.299 --> 01:18:22.132
you got lucky.

01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:24.966
There are no more bullets
in the chamber.

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.708
Whoops! My mistake!

01:18:30.577 --> 01:18:32.670
Well, Lauren...

01:18:32.746 --> 01:18:35.078
you'll pay the highest price of all
where you're going.

01:18:35.148 --> 01:18:39.278
Those wet lips and hot kisses will be
falling on deaf ears for a long time.

01:18:39.352 --> 01:18:40.785
They're all yours, Falls.

01:18:40.854 --> 01:18:44.915
Tied up tight, like a bride
on her honeymoon night.

01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:48.119
And so our tracks
have finally come together.

01:18:48.195 --> 01:18:51.289
It's time to drive the golden spike.

01:18:51.364 --> 01:18:55.926
Ryan Harrison, I say to you, on behalf
of law enforcement all over the world...

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:58.266
...you were wrongfully accused.

01:19:01.308 --> 01:19:02.741
Hmm?

01:19:05.812 --> 01:19:07.939
All right, people, move 'em out!

01:19:11.518 --> 01:19:14.009
- Ryan!
- Cass!

01:19:26.866 --> 01:19:28.527
Close your eyes.

01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:29.967
Now don't worry.

01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:32.394
I trust you.

01:19:33.773 --> 01:19:35.866
Keep your eyes closed.

01:19:41.815 --> 01:19:44.579
Now open your eyes.

01:19:44.651 --> 01:19:47.643
I feel like I'm flying!
