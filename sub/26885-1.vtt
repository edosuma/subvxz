00:34.019 --> 00:36.523
Where do you think
they're all from?

00:37.902 --> 00:39.389
The Silicon valley?

00:39.390 --> 00:41.099
Perhaps even New York.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.373
No, this is Iowa.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.949
Home of the only division

00:46.950 --> 00:49.240

African-American, Jack Trice.

00:49.241 --> 00:53.129
Who attended Iowa State
University in the 20s.

He was the second
African-American competing

00:56.010 --> 00:58.698
in college football at
a major university.

00:58.699 --> 01:00.539
Who's the first?

01:00.540 --> 01:02.369
Frank Holbrook, who
played for the.

01:24.510 --> 01:28.033
This city, with the greatest
tractors ever made.

01:29.072 --> 01:32.139
This is East High.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.459
Record for the longest
football winning streak

01:34.460 --> 01:35.460
in the state.

01:36.979 --> 01:37.812
Strangely enough, the record

01:37.813 --> 01:39.517
for the longest
losing streak, too.

01:39.518 --> 01:40.957
But whatever.

01:40.958 --> 01:43.939
Hey, Cedar Falls, suck
my dick from behind

01:43.940 --> 01:46.209

Waterloo is the home
of the greatest

01:55.300 --> 01:58.898
American Navy family,
the Sullivans.

The Sullivan brothers all

02:05.801 --> 02:08.399
This is a story that
inspired the movie,

02:08.400 --> 02:09.652
Saving Private Ryan.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.359
But my town of Waterloo,

02:13.360 --> 02:15.176
that's where you're gonna get

02:15.177 --> 02:16.889
the real American Experience.

02:16.890 --> 02:18.514
A large glass of scotch,

02:18.515 --> 02:20.157
plenty of great food,

02:20.158 --> 02:22.103
and genuine conversation.

02:49.756 --> 02:51.019
- American Pie was awesome.

02:51.020 --> 02:53.655
- I can't believe the kid
from Rookie of the Year

02:53.656 --> 02:55.335
got Tara Reid.

02:55.336 --> 02:57.560
- Harold was not aware of this.

02:57.561 --> 02:59.629
Who was the kid from
Rookie of the Year?

02:59.630 --> 03:02.449
- Thomas Ian Nicholas,
if I ever meet him,

03:02.450 --> 03:04.839
I'm gonna tell him The
Floater was shit.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.200
- Tara Reid is hot.

03:06.201 --> 03:07.892
- I like the part where the dude

03:07.893 --> 03:09.869
put his dick in the pie.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.349
- How do you know he's Jewish?

03:11.350 --> 03:15.816
- Because his dad is
Eugene Levy, Jew.

03:15.817 --> 03:18.248
- You come off so antisemitic.

03:18.249 --> 03:20.559
You need to work on that.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.877
- The intern Clinton
nailed was a Jew.

03:22.878 --> 03:25.037
- You know, in 20 years,

03:25.038 --> 03:28.439
our presidents, they'll
be married to models

03:28.440 --> 03:30.296
and plowing porn stars.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.760
- You Neanderthals.

03:32.761 --> 03:35.529
- Since your parents divorced,

03:35.530 --> 03:38.200
your weekends with your
dad have been great.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.719
- Thank you Father,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.069
for allowing us to
watch R rated movies.

03:42.070 --> 03:44.049
- Pisses Mom off,
which is funny.

03:44.050 --> 03:47.119
- I prefer American
Beauty over American Pie.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.989
It will win an Oscar.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.529
- I would rather see
a Jew screw a pie

03:51.530 --> 03:54.329
over a plastic bag
in the wind any day.

03:54.330 --> 03:55.789
- Dad keeps asking
me how many times

03:55.790 --> 03:57.059
the new boyfriend comes,

03:57.060 --> 03:58.719
comes about three times a week.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.459
Mom comes about seven or eight.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.699
Quit being such a fag, Dad.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.719
Move on, get a chick,

04:03.720 --> 04:05.569
sell some more Saturns
or something.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.052
- If you ever need to
talk about your feelings,

04:08.053 --> 04:11.778
after the divorce, Harold
is a good listener.

04:11.779 --> 04:13.549
- Feelings?

04:13.550 --> 04:15.517
I have two Christmases
now, you cock munchers.

04:15.518 --> 04:17.689
- Hey, where's Taylor?

04:17.690 --> 04:20.029
- He's hanging with
his girl he met.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.539
She's here for the summer.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.722
- What is this, Grease?

04:22.723 --> 04:25.973
♪ Those summer, nights ♪

04:28.440 --> 04:29.856
- I prefer Grease 2.

04:29.857 --> 04:31.279
Much better movie.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.319
Musical scenes, way better.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.799
Best bowling scene
in film history.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.847
- Taylor would sell
out his buddies

04:37.848 --> 04:39.360
for a chick any day.

04:39.361 --> 04:40.194
Pervert, Dee tried to tell him

04:40.195 --> 04:41.619
to keep his hands to himself.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.740
- I will wait for the
right girlfriend.

04:43.741 --> 04:45.749
Harold is classy.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.529
I want a lady with
that same standard.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.530
- Fag.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.278
- No way Richard Gere's going

04:55.279 --> 04:56.575
to rescue you if
you're a hooker.

04:56.576 --> 04:57.769
- Yeah, I guess he did
make out with her.

04:57.770 --> 04:59.780
You don't kiss a
hooker on the mouth.

04:59.781 --> 05:01.020
- No.

05:01.021 --> 05:02.038
- They'll bite off the
tip of your tongue.

05:02.039 --> 05:03.041
- They'll bite right on.

05:03.042 --> 05:04.060
- Like that shame on guy.

05:04.061 --> 05:04.894
- Wait, Sham-Wow guy.

05:04.895 --> 05:05.959
- You know the guy
from the infomercial

05:05.960 --> 05:06.840
with the shammy.

05:06.841 --> 05:08.060
- Yeah.

05:08.061 --> 05:08.894
He made out with a hooker.

05:08.895 --> 05:10.319
And she bit off the
tip of his tongue.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.153
- Holy shit!

05:11.154 --> 05:12.598
- Bit it right off.

05:12.599 --> 05:14.269
You don't kiss a
hooker on the mouth.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.103
- No shit.

05:15.104 --> 05:16.149
And Richard Gere gives her money

05:16.150 --> 05:17.804
to go shopping?

05:17.805 --> 05:18.979
- No, no.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.539
- He would've taken
her in an alley,

05:20.540 --> 05:22.146
bent her over a
dumpster, and said,

05:22.147 --> 05:23.541
"yeah, take that pig!"

05:23.542 --> 05:25.809
- Now that's a movie
I would totally

05:25.810 --> 05:27.599
go, I would pay
money to see that.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.499
- Yeah, you we think
we're above men

05:29.500 --> 05:31.609
in this area, but we
are just as depraved.

05:31.610 --> 05:32.443
How many copies

05:32.444 --> 05:33.783
of Fifty Shades of
Gray were sold?

05:33.784 --> 05:35.564
Three blockbuster films.

05:35.565 --> 05:36.398
- Oh, my God.

05:36.399 --> 05:39.679
Honestly, I mean, I'd
rather see that rich guy

05:39.680 --> 05:41.162
work over that chick,

05:41.163 --> 05:43.342
than watch the fucking Notebook.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.985
- I would rather have
my Catholic grandmother

05:45.986 --> 05:48.569
catch me watching hardcore

05:48.570 --> 05:49.622
gay porn

05:49.623 --> 05:51.549
than to watch the
fucking Notebook.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.619
- Gay porn is the best, though.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.004
That's a real romance movie.

05:55.005 --> 05:57.619
- Well, no, watching some twink

05:57.620 --> 06:00.023
get turned out by a
couple of hairy bears,

06:00.024 --> 06:01.339
hot.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.083
- Yeah, take that pig.

06:04.980 --> 06:05.813
- Hey, where's Tanner?

06:05.814 --> 06:07.039
- I don't know, man.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.469
I don't think his fiance

06:08.470 --> 06:10.019
likes him hanging out with me.

06:10.020 --> 06:10.853
- Why?

06:10.854 --> 06:12.609
- She treats me like I'm
from Marshal Town, man.

06:12.610 --> 06:15.287
I'm gonna take him out
to the Tiger's Den.

06:15.288 --> 06:17.769
He's gonna get hopped
up on crystal meth,

06:17.770 --> 06:19.403
take a swing at a stripper.

06:19.404 --> 06:21.979
- Well, she did have to
pick you guys up last week

06:21.980 --> 06:23.079
at four in the morning.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.010
- It's different man.

06:24.011 --> 06:27.723
Dave's stash makes some
killer Vegas bombs.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.030
Look at you man.

06:30.031 --> 06:31.589
Maybe you're the issue.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.619
Maybe he can't come
here because of you.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.203
You look like

06:35.204 --> 06:37.859
the devil wears Tommy Bahama.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.429
- Hey bro,

06:39.430 --> 06:40.529
this shit gets me
anything I want.

06:40.530 --> 06:43.480
And you're no peach
yourself either.

06:43.481 --> 06:45.139
- I know.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.123
A grown man wearing
Justin Bieber jacket.

06:47.124 --> 06:49.089
Maybe she's a little bit right.

06:49.090 --> 06:50.199
But still, fuck her.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.200
- Dude,

06:51.950 --> 06:53.329
you tell him to tell her

06:53.330 --> 06:54.639
he's at the real library.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.062
- That's what I'm thinking.

06:56.063 --> 06:58.029
Maybe you she'll

06:58.030 --> 06:59.639
wind up allowing
him to come out.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.400
Maybe he's gonna go
and say he's gonna

07:01.401 --> 07:02.234
I don't know,

07:02.235 --> 07:03.936
get like a boxcar kids

07:03.937 --> 07:06.462
novel, or Sweet Valley High.

07:06.463 --> 07:09.899
Hey, have we had this
conversation before?

07:09.900 --> 07:11.439
- Matt,

07:11.440 --> 07:12.819
we have this conversation

07:12.820 --> 07:13.670
every time.

07:13.671 --> 07:14.961
- Tanner's fiance's a bitch.

07:14.962 --> 07:17.089
- Major bitch.

07:17.090 --> 07:18.679
She's says that Tanner can't
come down here anymore

07:18.680 --> 07:20.219
because she doesn't want
him hanging around.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.210
Mr. Lance.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.843
- Oh, she said Jeff
Lance is a misogynist.

07:25.140 --> 07:25.973
- What a dumb clam.

07:25.974 --> 07:27.523
I don't even know gymnastics.

07:28.357 --> 07:29.190
- No, dude.

07:29.191 --> 07:30.659
That's a contortionist.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.419
- What the hell's a misogynist?

07:32.420 --> 07:34.219
- It's a man who's
prejudice against women,

07:34.220 --> 07:35.639
thinks that they're inferior.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.473
- Doesn't she know

07:36.474 --> 07:37.938
that I'm Jeff Lance?

07:37.939 --> 07:39.459
I love women.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.659
- That's right man.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.419
You love women.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.123
You're Jeff Lance.

07:45.124 --> 07:48.009
You don't treat women
like an object.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.539
They treat you like an object.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.579
- I know.

07:51.580 --> 07:52.959
I'm actually sensitive.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.179
I have feelings.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.722
I want to be held
and listened to

07:55.723 --> 07:57.083
like a puppy.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.580
- You know what,

08:01.380 --> 08:02.213
I'm gonna text Tanner,

08:02.213 --> 08:03.213
tell him

08:03.920 --> 08:05.189
hey,

08:05.190 --> 08:07.349
tell your fiance

08:07.350 --> 08:08.680
that Jeff says

08:08.681 --> 08:12.339
misogynists is an
awfully big word

08:12.340 --> 08:14.689
for such a little girl.

08:14.690 --> 08:15.993
And send.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.529
- Dude, that's something
a misogynist would say.

08:19.530 --> 08:21.149
- Exactly.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.360
- Funny, bro.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.862
- Don't worry about it.

08:24.863 --> 08:25.696
She doesn't it to everyone.

08:25.697 --> 08:27.479
- Yeah, she calls
everyone sexist,

08:27.480 --> 08:28.400
racist,

08:28.401 --> 08:29.459
homophobe.

08:29.460 --> 08:30.929
You name it.

08:30.930 --> 08:32.803
- Small minds do
it all the time.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.379
Sexist.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.212
Homophobe.

08:35.214 --> 08:36.429
Racist.

08:36.429 --> 08:38.178
Vocal trump cards
for the idiots.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.621
- You are a little
antisemitic at times.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.438
- Don't worry, Matt,

08:42.440 --> 08:44.433
the Jews will not replace you.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
- Hey.

08:48.739 --> 08:50.759
Got a text from Tanner.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.194
His fiance says she
will let us come over,

08:53.195 --> 08:55.089
but for just one drink.

08:55.090 --> 08:58.149
And we have to have
it in the driveway.

08:58.150 --> 08:59.219
- In the driveway?

08:59.220 --> 09:00.839
It's like on King of the Hill,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.061
Dammit Bobby.

09:02.062 --> 09:04.200
The Fiance is such a bitch.

09:04.201 --> 09:06.637
- Yeah man, I don't

20:03.650 --> 20:05.293
on his vocabulary all night.

20:09.193 --> 20:10.191
Starts with a Q.

20:10.192 --> 20:11.192
That earned him

20:11.193 --> 20:12.130
triple letter score.

20:12.131 --> 20:14.309
So guess what Tanner's word is.

20:14.310 --> 20:16.359
I'll give you a few hints.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.310
Muff grunt,

20:17.311 --> 20:18.899
box burp,

20:18.900 --> 20:19.746
sliz sneeze,

20:19.747 --> 20:21.799
womb wheeze,

20:21.800 --> 20:23.828
cunt cough.

20:23.829 --> 20:25.489
That's right.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.313
Tanner's word is Queef.

20:27.314 --> 20:28.679
And if you're still lost,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.273
Google pussy fart.

20:30.274 --> 20:33.829
Queef earned Tanner 63
points total on the word

20:33.830 --> 20:35.099
and gave him the lead.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.719
His finance was pissed.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.871
But her Ceder Falls
friends were impressed,

20:38.872 --> 20:40.849
and also laughing so hard

20:40.850 --> 20:43.329
that Tanner's finally
in with them.

20:43.330 --> 20:44.919
Just goes to show you

20:44.920 --> 20:46.089
everyone comes together

20:46.090 --> 20:47.429
at a campground

20:47.430 --> 20:49.031
over a twat tune.

20:49.032 --> 20:52.369
- Triple letter score
on the letter Q, nice.

20:52.370 --> 20:53.203
- Nice.

20:53.204 --> 20:55.329
He's putting that extra
chromosome to use.

20:55.330 --> 20:58.030
- I'll drink my scotch to that.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.059
- I'm telling you guys,

21:02.060 --> 21:03.849
Jeff Lance is my real father.

21:03.850 --> 21:04.683
I know it.

21:04.684 --> 21:05.749
- He went in with your mom

21:05.750 --> 21:06.889
when he was 12 years old,

21:06.890 --> 21:08.385
you do realize this.

21:08.386 --> 21:09.220
- That's what I'm saying.

21:09.221 --> 21:11.687
She had Jeff in class
when he was 12.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.842
- That means your mom's
a child molester.

21:13.843 --> 21:17.505
- Yes, but my real
father's a stud.

21:17.506 --> 21:18.339
- Well, it makes sense.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.745
You do like raw
dogging the strange.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.259
- Patrick Plumly.

21:24.260 --> 21:25.649
He owns On The Rocks,

21:25.650 --> 21:28.268
a bar with over 15
different Moscow mules,

21:28.269 --> 21:30.499
eight craft beers on tap,

21:30.500 --> 21:32.150
and even more
bottled and canned.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.619
A place like On The
Rocks is a staple

21:34.620 --> 21:35.920
in the Waterloo nightlife.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.899
Come have some of
the best drinks,

21:38.900 --> 21:41.999
cocktails, beers in the
whole Ceder Valley

21:42.000 --> 21:43.939
all while taking in some artwork

21:43.940 --> 21:45.043
of a vintage Waterloo.

21:51.154 --> 21:52.140
The Dipshit Twins,

21:52.141 --> 21:53.847
the smartest guys in the valley.

21:53.848 --> 21:56.908
They received the highest marks
at Iowa State University.

21:56.909 --> 22:00.679
Later, they attended both
Columbia and Harvard.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.159
Inspired by their heroes,

22:02.160 --> 22:03.549
Neil Degrasse Tyson

22:03.550 --> 22:04.573
and Carl Sagan.

22:06.182 --> 22:07.015
But like any other genius,

22:07.016 --> 22:08.149
if you want to throw them off,

22:08.150 --> 22:09.809
get them on a sex topic.

22:09.810 --> 22:12.209
It totally throws a genius off.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.519
Einstein can come up with
a theory of relativity,

22:14.520 --> 22:16.729
but ask that
non-practicing Jew krout

22:16.730 --> 22:18.829
to find the G spot on a woman,

22:18.830 --> 22:20.739
and he will be more shaken

22:20.740 --> 22:22.439
than Richard Spencer

22:22.440 --> 22:24.763
asking for directions in a KFC

22:24.764 --> 22:25.650
on the southside of Chicago.

22:25.650 --> 22:26.650
- You know,

22:27.622 --> 22:28.666
I was thinking

22:28.667 --> 22:31.424
on the topic of
black holes again.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.229
- Here we go.

22:33.230 --> 22:34.899
- We do not know

22:34.900 --> 22:36.864
what laws of physics apply
within a black hole.

22:36.865 --> 22:38.864
We just don't.

22:38.865 --> 22:40.466
We're applying standard
laws of physics,

22:40.467 --> 22:41.809
but they can't apply there.

22:41.810 --> 22:42.810
They can't.

22:43.484 --> 22:44.484
- Again,

22:45.265 --> 22:46.549
the standard laws of physics

22:46.550 --> 22:48.299
can apply to a black hole

22:48.300 --> 22:50.109
if there is any presence

22:50.110 --> 22:51.769
of something here on earth

22:51.770 --> 22:53.229
such as

22:53.230 --> 22:54.200
gravity.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.033
- Gravity.

22:55.034 --> 22:57.200
Oh, so that's what
Google was talking about

22:57.201 --> 22:58.379
when I looked it up earlier.

22:58.380 --> 22:59.213
- Yes,

22:59.214 --> 23:02.129
the same gravity that
takes this beautiful dart

23:02.130 --> 23:03.100
to the black

23:03.101 --> 23:04.699
hole of that

23:04.700 --> 23:07.189
gaping bullseye.

23:07.190 --> 23:08.369
Right in the center.

23:08.370 --> 23:09.370
Don't look.

23:10.750 --> 23:11.859
- Well,

23:11.860 --> 23:13.099
- Jesus Christ.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.320
What in the world of Breaking
Bad biology did I walk in on?

23:16.321 --> 23:18.253
- Matt.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.003
- You nerds talking about.

23:21.004 --> 23:23.519
Black holes again?

23:23.520 --> 23:25.189
- Just because we
identify as nerds

23:25.190 --> 23:26.969
doesn't mean you
can call us nerds.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.109
We can call each other nerds.

23:28.110 --> 23:29.539
You can't call us nerds.

23:29.540 --> 23:30.520
Nerd.

23:30.521 --> 23:32.079
- Hey, nerd.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.913
- Hey.

23:32.914 --> 23:34.399
- Yes, we're talking
about black holes.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.249
- Man, you guys talk
about black holes

23:36.250 --> 23:37.995
more than Robert Pinero.

23:37.996 --> 23:41.949
- Hold on.

23:41.950 --> 23:43.883
He's doing that
comedy thing again.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.439
Because

23:46.440 --> 23:47.340
Robert De Niro,

23:47.341 --> 23:48.821
Bobby as I call him,

23:48.822 --> 23:50.989
he likes black women.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.304
So that is funny.

23:53.590 --> 23:54.530
- Bobby of Niro

23:54.531 --> 23:56.064
likes black.

23:59.960 --> 24:00.959
- Jesus guys.

24:00.960 --> 24:01.963
Seriously.

24:01.964 --> 24:02.961
But I'll play along.

24:02.962 --> 24:04.384
- Oh.

24:04.385 --> 24:05.382
- So,

24:05.382 --> 24:06.215
let's just say the guy
particle accelerator

24:06.216 --> 24:08.779
and taken out all these
mini black holes.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.400
- Yes, you're
speaking my language.

24:10.401 --> 24:13.619
- They go ahead and toss us

24:13.620 --> 24:15.563
into the Mandela Effect.

24:15.564 --> 24:17.986
Mandela Effect.

24:17.987 --> 24:20.829
The Mandela Effect refers to
an enlarged number of people

24:20.830 --> 24:22.349
share a false memory,

24:22.350 --> 24:24.659
originally attributed
to the existence

24:24.660 --> 24:26.239
of multiple universes.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.840
Are we currently residing in it?

24:29.840 --> 24:30.944
- Let's see.

24:36.588 --> 24:37.522
Answer the question.

24:37.523 --> 24:38.544
- Bernstein.

24:38.545 --> 24:41.184
I guess you could
be a possibility.

24:41.185 --> 24:42.393
Next question.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.205
- It could be a possibility.

24:45.206 --> 24:46.729
- But.

24:46.730 --> 24:49.205
- If only you were to believe in

24:49.206 --> 24:51.159
alternate timelines.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.969
Or I don't know,

24:52.970 --> 24:54.029
maybe something

24:54.030 --> 24:55.905
like alternate universes.

24:57.321 --> 24:58.839
A bubble universe.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
- I get it.

25:01.581 --> 25:02.585
Like Rick and Morty, right.

25:02.586 --> 25:05.109
- No, I don't like
Rick and Morty.

25:05.110 --> 25:06.539
It's too smart for me.

25:06.540 --> 25:07.899
Make my brain hurt.

25:07.900 --> 25:08.900
- Pickle.

25:10.188 --> 25:11.867
- Pickle dick.

25:11.868 --> 25:12.969
Ow.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.319
- It's pickle Rick.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.085
I got another question
for you guys.

25:16.086 --> 25:17.979
You think

25:17.980 --> 25:19.563
- because.
- Yes.

25:19.564 --> 25:20.959
- These black holes opening,

25:20.960 --> 25:23.264
toss us into an
alternate universe

25:23.265 --> 25:25.422
within ourselves

25:25.423 --> 25:29.109
that we actually have
non binary people.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.638
People who do not identify

25:31.639 --> 25:33.359
as either gender,

25:33.360 --> 25:35.779
nor masculine, nor feminine.

25:35.780 --> 25:38.363
That they see neither of them.

25:38.364 --> 25:42.609
That however they exist
outside the binary,

25:42.610 --> 25:45.639
and outside the cis normativity.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.199
I'm telling you some people

25:47.200 --> 25:49.549
do not see gender, but just see

25:49.550 --> 25:53.269
who they actually
are as a person.

25:53.270 --> 25:54.763
- See people.

25:54.764 --> 25:59.063
I've been to 17
different colleges.

26:02.210 --> 26:03.558
- Dizzy.

26:03.559 --> 26:04.929
Matt,

26:04.930 --> 26:08.622
what the fuck are you
talking about man?

26:08.623 --> 26:09.703
- Yeah.

26:09.704 --> 26:11.845
What are you saying?

26:11.846 --> 26:12.928
- I'm just saying

26:12.929 --> 26:14.369
these people don't see gender.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.085
- You're hurting
Dipshitowits one.

26:16.086 --> 26:17.733
- Shut up, Dipshitowits two.

26:18.806 --> 26:21.785
- How can you not see gender?

26:21.786 --> 26:22.786
That's

26:23.708 --> 26:25.259
all you can see when
you're doing it.

26:25.260 --> 26:26.130
Look,

26:26.131 --> 26:27.808
hey, hey, hey.

26:27.809 --> 26:29.327
Honk, honk.

26:29.328 --> 26:30.849
Honk, honk.

26:30.850 --> 26:31.750
- It's all you can see.

26:31.751 --> 26:34.347
It's all you can see.

26:34.348 --> 26:36.805
- Hey, hey, gender, gender,

26:36.806 --> 26:38.059
gender, gender.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.803
Hey, hey, hey.

26:39.804 --> 26:40.957
- Let's put it,

26:40.958 --> 26:41.934
hey,

26:41.935 --> 26:43.032
hey.

26:43.033 --> 26:44.471
- Hey.
- I'm doing both parts.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.305
Hey.

26:45.306 --> 26:46.309
What?

26:46.310 --> 26:48.019
- You're gonna get
us kicked out again.

26:48.020 --> 26:48.913
- Sorry.

26:48.913 --> 26:49.746
Sorry.

26:49.746 --> 26:50.579
- What are you gonna do?

26:50.580 --> 26:52.432
Oh yeah, here's a big seven inch

26:52.433 --> 26:54.229
dark and red veiny,

26:54.230 --> 26:55.439
sweaty,

26:55.440 --> 26:57.552
smelly non-binary.

26:57.553 --> 26:59.232
- It's my big,

26:59.233 --> 27:00.592
huge,

27:00.593 --> 27:01.593
two inches,

27:02.593 --> 27:03.595
give or take

27:03.596 --> 27:04.875
veiny.

27:04.876 --> 27:06.192
Looks almost like...

27:06.193 --> 27:08.693
- Big, huge,

27:08.694 --> 27:09.915
two inches?

27:09.916 --> 27:11.195
- Go.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.210
- I mean,

27:12.211 --> 27:13.413
I don't think they see it
kind of that way boys.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.709
- Well you sometimes
you need a microscope,

27:15.710 --> 27:16.852
but you can see it that way.

27:16.853 --> 27:17.810
- You can see it.

27:17.811 --> 27:19.289
I've looked.

27:19.290 --> 27:20.869
Scientific curiosity.

27:20.870 --> 27:21.870
Nothing weird.

27:23.230 --> 27:24.832
Look, Matt,

27:24.833 --> 27:26.299
let's put it in dummy language.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.213
- Yeah, we're the Dipshits.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.712
Sure.

27:30.546 --> 27:31.379
- There's no denying dick.

27:31.379 --> 27:32.212
- Yeah.

27:32.212 --> 27:33.045
- There's no denying dick.

27:33.046 --> 27:34.295
There's no denying dick.

27:34.296 --> 27:35.878
There's no denying dick.

27:35.879 --> 27:37.296
There's no denying dick.

27:37.297 --> 27:38.714
There's no denying dick.

27:38.715 --> 27:40.219
There's no denying dick.

27:40.220 --> 27:41.675
There's no denying dick.

27:41.676 --> 27:42.676
There's no.

27:43.478 --> 27:44.555
- You know what.

27:44.556 --> 27:45.595
- What?

27:45.596 --> 27:46.429
- Let's go home.

27:46.429 --> 27:47.396
- Yeah.

27:47.397 --> 27:48.418
- Get the whiteboard out,

27:48.419 --> 27:49.659
put some fricking Windex on it.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.239
And then we're gonna
figure this out

27:55.240 --> 27:58.009
for once and for all.

27:58.010 --> 27:58.843
- Yeah Matt.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.958
You're such a fricking A-hole.

28:00.959 --> 28:03.139
Pardon my language, but

28:03.140 --> 28:04.020
we're trying to

28:04.021 --> 28:05.838
go on solve

28:05.839 --> 28:06.672
the straight dairy problem.

28:06.673 --> 28:08.456
Now you got me all twisted up.

28:08.457 --> 28:09.624
Now we have to

28:10.614 --> 28:11.729
fricking solve

28:11.730 --> 28:12.879
non-binary.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.689
- Computer scientists.

28:14.690 --> 28:15.690
Let's go.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.862
- A couple of science nerds,

28:20.863 --> 28:22.449
they're not very PC.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.450
Indepedent film.

28:24.639 --> 28:27.420
They must have meant
Independent film.

28:27.421 --> 28:30.958
The Mandela Effect.

28:30.959 --> 28:31.830
But an Independent film

28:31.831 --> 28:33.400
set in Waterloo, Iowa

28:33.401 --> 28:35.502
named Bros.

28:35.503 --> 28:37.023
Oh man, that's got to suck.

28:38.340 --> 28:39.300
- You running off
my customers again?

28:39.301 --> 28:40.939
- Come on man, they were
just gonna drink up

28:40.940 --> 28:42.379
my fucking favorite scotch.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.918
- Doesn't matter.

28:43.919 --> 28:45.036
- Tell you what,

28:45.037 --> 28:47.649
I'm gonna drink the
majority of that bottle

28:47.650 --> 28:49.159
in there anyways.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.640
And they were probably gonna
have a bunch of waters.

28:51.641 --> 28:53.189
It won't matter.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.499
They're science dorks.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.989
I'm a drunk.

28:55.990 --> 28:56.990
I pay more.

28:58.340 --> 29:00.159
- I love alcoholism.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.676
- Hey, hey,

29:01.677 --> 29:03.039
the Waterloo Manati
meeting just let out?

29:03.040 --> 29:04.099
- Matt, good to see you.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.529
- Good seeing you.

29:05.530 --> 29:07.543
- Where's your buddy, Tanner?

29:07.544 --> 29:09.762
- He's out with his
fiance tonight.

29:09.763 --> 29:10.660
- Yep.

29:10.661 --> 29:13.042
That happens when you get older.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.802
People, they get married.

29:14.803 --> 29:15.803
They have kids.

29:16.570 --> 29:18.061
Be happy for your friend.

29:18.062 --> 29:20.289
- Yeah, speaking of which,

29:20.290 --> 29:21.866
he's playing scrabble with her.

29:21.867 --> 29:24.301
Check out the word he played.

29:24.302 --> 29:25.789
- Oh, yeah.

29:25.790 --> 29:27.529
That's nice placement
there on that Q.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.063
Triple letter score.

29:29.064 --> 29:30.719
63 points.

29:30.720 --> 29:31.793
Very nice.

29:32.970 --> 29:33.989
- Yeah.

29:33.990 --> 29:35.090
I hate drinking alone.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.959
- Eat your bread

29:39.960 --> 29:41.839
with joy and drink your wine

29:41.840 --> 29:42.849
with a merry heart,

29:42.850 --> 29:44.639
for god has already approved

29:44.640 --> 29:46.079
what you do.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.199
- That's beautiful.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.679
Who's that?

29:48.680 --> 29:49.703
Luke Bryant?

29:49.704 --> 29:50.702
Kanye West?

29:50.703 --> 29:52.019
- It's Ecclesiastes nine seven.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.202
It's from the bible.

29:53.203 --> 29:54.269
- Yeah.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.381
I always try to give musicians
way too much credit.

29:56.382 --> 29:59.076
- Let me ask you something,

29:59.077 --> 30:00.640
what have you done so far today?

30:00.641 --> 30:02.701
- Well, it started off.

30:02.702 --> 30:04.099
I had some shots with Jeff
Lance at the Library.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.169
I went and saw

30:05.170 --> 30:07.069
pro-wrestling at the
Five Sullivan Center.

30:07.070 --> 30:10.105
And went and saw Pamela The
Punisher Poet next door.

30:10.106 --> 30:11.705
It's been pretty cool.

30:11.706 --> 30:14.849
- All that in the course
of one Saturday afternoon

30:14.850 --> 30:16.105
in the Cedar Valley.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.759
You know,

30:17.760 --> 30:19.879
the Douist define grace

30:19.880 --> 30:21.239
not so much

30:21.240 --> 30:23.399
by the words that you say,

30:23.400 --> 30:24.509
but by your actions,

30:24.510 --> 30:25.343
your movements,

30:25.344 --> 30:26.393
how you live life.

30:27.330 --> 30:30.189
You have more wealth in
these few city blocks

30:30.190 --> 30:31.429
than most people have

30:31.430 --> 30:32.709
anywhere in the world.

30:32.710 --> 30:34.148
Where else,

30:34.149 --> 30:34.982
other than

30:34.983 --> 30:36.148
maybe Las Vegas or something

30:36.149 --> 30:36.982
can you get

30:36.983 --> 30:38.686
a glass of scotch that full?

30:38.687 --> 30:41.979
Be happy for your friends,

30:41.980 --> 30:43.159
for they come and go.

30:43.160 --> 30:46.109
You know they'll always
be those children

30:46.110 --> 30:47.100
and those wives out there.

30:47.101 --> 30:48.129
Be happy for them too

30:48.130 --> 30:50.505
because this too may
come for you someday.

30:50.506 --> 30:51.506
- Yeah.

30:53.029 --> 30:54.228
What if it doesn't?

30:54.229 --> 30:56.239
- Well then you're just
another old guy at a bar.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.668
But see that's okay too.

30:57.669 --> 31:01.059
You need to cherish
your memories,

31:01.060 --> 31:02.548
enjoy your scotch,

31:02.549 --> 31:04.925
and remember the five
Sullivan brothers.

31:04.926 --> 31:08.249
They would have loved to be
able to come back to this town

31:08.250 --> 31:11.287
and enjoy it the
way that you have.

31:11.288 --> 31:13.393
- How'd you get so wise?

31:16.140 --> 31:18.429
- I come from Oelwein, Iowa.

31:18.430 --> 31:21.049
Oh hey, I have two tickets
to the court games.

31:21.050 --> 31:24.379
Starts in about 15 minutes.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.099
If you can find somebody
to go with you, great.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.190
If not, then you just
enjoy your evening.

31:28.191 --> 31:30.393
- Thanks man.

31:31.348 --> 31:33.399
I always appreciated
our friendship.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.409
- Take care.

31:34.410 --> 31:36.283
Finish that scotch.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.646
- The Cedar Valley court games.

31:51.647 --> 31:55.565
Waterloo's Midwest
professional basketball team.

31:55.566 --> 31:59.509
Actually, the Midwest
professional basketball league

31:59.510 --> 32:00.888
champions.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.225
- Speaking of broke,

32:51.226 --> 32:52.059
do you have enough
money to finish

32:52.059 --> 32:53.059
paying for your haircut?

32:53.910 --> 32:55.145
- I see, it's cool, it's cool.

32:55.146 --> 32:56.148
It's hard out here man.

32:56.149 --> 32:58.889
- You look like Raggedy Anne
after a house fire, man.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.869
- People's hair,

33:00.870 --> 33:02.729
I mean one more hair strand
falls out your hair, man,

33:02.730 --> 33:04.969
you're gonna look like broke
Bruce Willis or something.

33:04.970 --> 33:06.465
I'm just saying.

33:06.466 --> 33:07.966
- Jersey Shore reject.

33:07.967 --> 33:09.447
You look like old Asians.

33:09.967 --> 33:11.780
- Speaking of that,

33:11.781 --> 33:13.099
you sure look like
you came off the gas

33:13.100 --> 33:14.100
golf course seven.

33:14.101 --> 33:15.550
- I did, I see you dad there.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.263
- Speaking of rejects,

33:18.264 --> 33:19.268
like your hairline's
been rejecting

33:19.269 --> 33:20.329
your forehead a little bit.

33:20.330 --> 33:21.609
I don't know what's going on.

33:21.610 --> 33:22.607
- Your hairline look
like a fundraiser.

33:22.607 --> 33:23.607
I'm sorry.

33:24.826 --> 33:25.826
- You guys are black.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.003
- You kind of look like an Oreo.

33:32.069 --> 33:33.129
- A broreo.

33:33.130 --> 33:34.147
- A broreo.

33:34.148 --> 33:35.188
I like that.

33:35.189 --> 33:36.328
I like that, let's toast
to that right there.

33:36.329 --> 33:37.609
- Bros for life.
- Bros for life.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.023
- So I was thinking,

33:43.024 --> 33:44.384
and I think I might
like the sound

33:45.269 --> 33:46.220
of some little feet
pitter pattering.

33:46.221 --> 33:48.229
I think maybe we
should start a family.

33:48.230 --> 33:49.063
- Oh my god.

33:49.064 --> 33:50.719
I love being your wife.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.046
I would make such a great mom.

33:52.047 --> 33:53.189
I would love to have

33:53.190 --> 33:54.569
a little boy or girl with you.

33:54.570 --> 33:55.460
- Okay.

33:55.461 --> 33:56.849
I'll throw away the condoms.

33:56.850 --> 33:57.979
You start taking
your temperature

33:57.980 --> 33:59.089
and charting your days.

33:59.090 --> 34:00.649
And I'll triangulate
the insemination

34:00.650 --> 34:01.679
for the best possible outcome.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.239
- The way you sound it,

34:03.240 --> 34:04.339
it's so dirty.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.340
I love it.

34:06.840 --> 34:07.800
- Black Hawk county seat

34:07.801 --> 34:09.609
was originally in Cedar Falls.

34:09.610 --> 34:11.069
- Yeah, and then some
Waterloo residents

34:11.070 --> 34:12.549
went over and seized
the documents

34:12.550 --> 34:14.029
and brought them
back to Waterloo.

34:14.030 --> 34:15.059
- Wait, is this a story

34:15.060 --> 34:16.649
where they threw
eggs at each other?

34:16.650 --> 34:17.748
- Yeah, they called
it the egg war.

34:17.748 --> 34:19.949
- Hard boiled.

34:19.949 --> 34:21.545
Just like city councils
in these towns.

34:21.545 --> 34:23.009
- Or over easy,

34:23.010 --> 34:24.809
like the Cedar Valley women.

34:24.810 --> 34:27.259
- So according to this,

34:27.260 --> 34:29.623
we conceived on the weekend
of the 11th and the 12th.

34:29.623 --> 34:32.239
- Hey, that was the weekend

34:32.239 --> 34:34.829
I was out of town at
my nana's funeral.

34:34.830 --> 34:35.744
- Oh my god.

34:35.745 --> 34:37.266
Sorry.

34:37.268 --> 34:38.639
- It's okay.

34:38.639 --> 34:40.639
I fucked somebody else
that weekend too.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.353
- C'est la vie.

34:42.353 --> 34:43.402
- Sera, sera.

34:45.010 --> 34:47.428
- Mom, you got to stop
hitting on guys my age.

34:47.429 --> 34:49.379
Stop flirting with
my guy friends.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.869
- You know people think we could

34:51.870 --> 34:53.246
actually be sisters.

34:53.246 --> 34:55.069
- You slow down.

34:55.070 --> 34:56.429
You're way too much.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.046
- I am a cougar.

34:58.047 --> 34:59.828
It's our time now.

34:59.829 --> 35:02.009
I will not slow down.

35:02.010 --> 35:05.049
It's MILF time.

35:05.050 --> 35:05.883
- Gross.

35:05.884 --> 35:08.030
- Your little friend,
Jake, didn't think so.

35:19.004 --> 35:21.029
- This is Elias,

35:21.030 --> 35:22.468
a good Christian boy.

35:22.469 --> 35:24.779
Drank way too much one night.

35:24.780 --> 35:29.159
Actually, he went on an
entire weekend bender.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.249
Now, he's in
alcoholic's anonymous.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.308
So we refer to him as.

35:34.309 --> 35:36.779
AA Elias.

35:36.780 --> 35:38.543
- Shit this shit's man.

35:40.582 --> 35:42.466
Why don't they fix
this shit, dude?

35:45.267 --> 35:46.684
Who gives a shit.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.039
- Hey, Jorge.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.304
- What you want, dude?

35:54.305 --> 35:55.629
- You know I'm really
concerned about you man.

35:55.630 --> 35:57.265
I'm really concerned
about your health.

35:57.266 --> 35:58.525
Hwy don't you take
a look at this.

35:58.526 --> 36:00.019
Really could help you out.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.010
- You think?

36:01.011 --> 36:02.605
- Yeah man.

36:02.606 --> 36:03.819
It helped me.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.047
- Whatever dude.

36:05.048 --> 36:06.409
Go away dude, I'm drinking.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.539
- Alright, just think
about it, man.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.128
- Yeah whatever dude.

36:09.129 --> 36:10.129
Go fuck yourself.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.377
Holy shit, AA works.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.570
Alright.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.930
- I love the two of you in Oz.

36:36.931 --> 36:38.968
- What's up man.

36:38.969 --> 36:41.527
- Hey, what's up Jorge?

36:41.528 --> 36:42.706
What's up dude?

36:42.707 --> 36:43.746
Marcel, can I get another run?

36:43.747 --> 36:44.747
Thank you.

36:45.609 --> 36:46.886
- This time of the day, dude?

36:46.887 --> 36:47.887
- Yeah.

36:49.507 --> 36:50.979
You have the same one too.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.088
- I'm in mourning dude.

36:52.089 --> 36:54.770
- Yeah, I guess I'm
in mourning too.

36:54.771 --> 36:57.389
- Why, Anthony Bourdain too?

36:57.390 --> 36:58.280
You heard about that shit too?

36:58.281 --> 37:00.009
- No, Tanner.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.439
He's got a fiance.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.370
Can't hang out with me.

37:02.371 --> 37:03.519
- He found someone
tighter than you, huh.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.189
- Yeah, I guess in a way.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.709
- In a way?

37:06.710 --> 37:08.210
Really?

37:08.211 --> 37:09.369
- Yeah.

37:09.370 --> 37:10.949
Who's fucking push
light is that?

37:10.950 --> 37:11.890
- That's that milk weed,

37:11.891 --> 37:13.209
Tyler of the tool.

37:13.210 --> 37:14.043
- Oh Jesus Christ.

37:14.044 --> 37:16.349
Was diet mountain dew too spicy?

37:16.350 --> 37:17.528
- For that milk weed

37:17.529 --> 37:19.129
motherfucker, maybe.

37:22.510 --> 37:23.369
- Oh yeah.

37:23.370 --> 37:25.629
Extra cheese was a good call.

37:25.630 --> 37:26.880
It's a two flusher, baby.

37:34.830 --> 37:38.269
Pouring one out for your
dead homies over there?

37:39.720 --> 37:40.989
You guys both have a grinder.

37:40.990 --> 37:42.129
That's how you guys met.

37:42.130 --> 37:42.963
That's awesome.

37:42.964 --> 37:44.306
Good for you guys.

37:44.307 --> 37:45.140
You guys are a beautiful couple.

37:45.140 --> 37:45.973
I like the melting pot

37:45.974 --> 37:47.528
kind of situation going on here.

37:47.529 --> 37:48.967
- Hey, at least I get
swiped right, motherfucker.

37:48.968 --> 37:50.859
Hey, what's with the jacket?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.408
Were you worried about
the Jews replacing you?

37:52.409 --> 37:54.969
- You couldn't replace me.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.305
I look like

37:56.306 --> 37:58.219
if Adolph Hitler could
perfectly design somebody.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.128
A genetically modified boy
band member basically.

38:02.187 --> 38:03.719
- Yeah, the Richard
Spencer Five.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.553
I've heard of them.

38:04.554 --> 38:05.556
- You're just like my uncle.

38:05.557 --> 38:06.602
You went south of the border.

38:06.603 --> 38:08.349
You got a nice Hispanic wife.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.359
You're like the guy

38:09.360 --> 38:10.419
from Modern Family.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.420
That's awesome.

38:12.923 --> 38:14.588
- You're adorable.

38:14.589 --> 38:15.879
- That's like your mom said.

38:15.880 --> 38:16.840
She thinks I'm real cute.

38:16.841 --> 38:19.729
She put me up in her big
strong Mexican arms,

38:19.730 --> 38:21.439
like a big bundle of fruit.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.967
Just picked me up.

38:22.968 --> 38:23.970
- Hey,

38:23.971 --> 38:24.804
where's your dipshit friend at?

38:24.805 --> 38:25.984
Tyler?

38:25.985 --> 38:26.818
- Pulling doubles over
at the golf course, man.

38:26.818 --> 38:27.651
Golf pro.

38:27.651 --> 38:28.640
Making that good money.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.180
He's got a kid on the way.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.144
He fucks girls, unlike you guys.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.189
- Putting.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.609
The short game.

38:36.610 --> 38:39.026
Well, half the game actually.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.786
You master this, and

38:40.787 --> 38:44.765
I think I see a little green
jacket in your future.

38:44.766 --> 38:46.143
But,

38:47.185 --> 38:49.519
but you got to eye on the ball

38:49.520 --> 38:51.609
and then put through

38:51.610 --> 38:52.662
to the hole.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.009
Through to the hole.

38:55.010 --> 38:56.010
But,

38:56.690 --> 38:57.944
you got to focus.

38:57.945 --> 38:59.349
Buddy.

38:59.350 --> 39:00.350
Focus.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.480
- Hey, I thought that was a
baby ruth in Caddyshack.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.099
- Yeah, but all they
had was snickers.

39:21.100 --> 39:23.323
- Hey, no more
Caddyshack references.

39:23.324 --> 39:25.202
- But man, orange balls.

39:25.203 --> 39:27.864
Hey Wayne, this is
a swanky joint.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.762
Go tell him you're Jewish.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.423
- No more Caddyshack references.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.889
No more Caddyshack references.

39:37.890 --> 39:39.039
I'm fucking serious.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.949
- Oh baby.

39:40.950 --> 39:43.017
This is a big one.

39:43.018 --> 39:43.851
- Alright, don't count that one.

39:43.852 --> 39:45.029
That was interfered with.

39:45.030 --> 39:47.459
- The whole world needs
ditch diggers too.

39:47.460 --> 39:49.329
- What'd I say about
Caddyshack references?

39:49.330 --> 39:50.824
- What's the matter?

39:50.825 --> 39:51.658
I just want to bring
you a present.

39:51.659 --> 39:52.659
- No

39:52.660 --> 39:54.169
more.

39:54.170 --> 39:55.199
Caddyshack references.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.409
- Hey, that's from
Caddyshack two.

39:56.410 --> 39:58.809
- Yeah, it's from
Caddyshack two, bra.

39:58.810 --> 39:59.929
- Shit man.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.565
The last time I saw you,

40:01.566 --> 40:04.582
the night in Cedar
Falls with Heather.

40:04.583 --> 40:07.239
- Yet that girl talks about
how small my dick is.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.409
Like you're six foot four,

40:08.410 --> 40:09.569
everything looks that small

40:09.570 --> 40:11.064
compared to that.

40:11.065 --> 40:11.898
Come on.

40:11.898 --> 40:12.731
- You ever notice
when she gets mad,

40:12.732 --> 40:14.529
she kind of looks
like William Defoe?

40:14.530 --> 40:15.390
- Oh dude, it's like

40:15.391 --> 40:16.869
kind of like seeing my stepdad.

40:16.870 --> 40:17.703
It's crazy.

40:17.703 --> 40:18.560
Like

40:18.561 --> 40:20.869
the guy that got shot
by fucking Jake Taylor

40:20.870 --> 40:22.489
from Major League in Platoon,

40:22.490 --> 40:23.323
you know what I'm talking about.

40:23.324 --> 40:24.339
- Yeah dude.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.340
Oh my god.

40:26.046 --> 40:27.806
Was she on the rescue
in the Boondock Saints?

40:28.120 --> 40:28.953
- Yeah.

40:28.954 --> 40:30.461
Born on the fourth of July.

40:32.446 --> 40:33.279
- You two are peas in a pod.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.509
What are you, a fucking

40:34.510 --> 40:36.024
shake swords together sometimes.

40:36.025 --> 40:37.725
- That's not a bad idea?

40:37.726 --> 40:39.384
- Yeah man.

40:39.385 --> 40:43.219
Hey, you got to have
somebody from a movie

40:43.220 --> 40:44.070
talk shit about your dick,

40:44.071 --> 40:45.821
who would it be?

40:45.822 --> 40:47.041
- Oh man, probably
Hannibal Lector, man.

40:47.042 --> 40:48.042
He'd be like

40:48.780 --> 40:49.809
go into great detail about it,

40:49.810 --> 40:51.679
and then like snack that shit
up with some fava beans.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.682
What about you?

40:55.683 --> 40:57.419
- Weirdly,

40:57.420 --> 40:58.469
Cruella de Vil.

40:58.470 --> 40:59.679
- 101 Dalmatians.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.744
- Yeah.

41:00.745 --> 41:01.578
Yeah, she'd talk shit about it,

41:01.579 --> 41:03.159
she'd still see
the beauty in it.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.739
She'd just have to
find a 100 more

41:04.740 --> 41:06.659
and fashion it in to a
fashionable jacket.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.002
- A nice little dick coat.

41:08.003 --> 41:09.312
- Yeah, who wouldn't wear
a dick skinned jacket?

41:09.313 --> 41:10.444
- I would look good
in a dick coat.

41:10.445 --> 41:12.478
- That jacket is tighter
than dick skin.

41:12.479 --> 41:13.993
- Absolutely.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.219
- So,

41:18.220 --> 41:19.282
fuck it.

41:19.283 --> 41:20.116
You want to go to Lava Lounge?

41:20.116 --> 41:20.949
I'll buy you a scotch.

41:20.949 --> 41:21.850
$12,

41:21.850 --> 41:22.850
the good kind.

41:24.723 --> 41:25.556
- Trailer Park Boys, nice.

41:25.557 --> 41:26.957
- Nice.

41:26.958 --> 41:28.824
- Well, it looks like
I'm Julien on this one,

41:28.825 --> 41:30.322
cause I'm taking
my drink with me.

41:30.323 --> 41:31.539
- It's about to fucking time.

41:31.540 --> 41:32.729
- Have a good one.

41:32.730 --> 41:33.944
Adios amigo.

41:33.945 --> 41:35.239
- Yeah, fuck yourself.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.289
- No, C3-PO has a silver leg.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.800
- Mandela Effect.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.559
- No, what.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.664
No, no, no, no, no.

41:42.665 --> 41:43.662
C3-PO is gold

41:43.663 --> 41:44.709
and Han did the Castle Run

41:44.710 --> 41:46.719
in 12 parsecs.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.553
Duh.

41:47.554 --> 41:48.919
- Pretty sure it was 14.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.339
- He told Chewy

41:50.340 --> 41:51.366
that he rounded down in Solo.

41:51.367 --> 41:52.463
- Either way,

41:53.481 --> 41:54.482
it's still impressive.

41:54.483 --> 41:56.099
- So,

41:56.100 --> 41:58.519
is Rey Han and Leia's kid?

41:58.520 --> 41:59.353
- How the hell

41:59.354 --> 42:01.682
would Luke and Leia
not sense that?

42:01.683 --> 42:04.540
I mean these jedis are unreal.

42:04.541 --> 42:09.478
Leia can Mary Poppins through
the vacuum of space,

42:09.479 --> 42:12.158
but she can't keep track
of her damn kids.

42:12.159 --> 42:14.809
- There's no way that Rey
is their kid anyway.

42:14.810 --> 42:15.760
Han and Leia,

42:15.761 --> 42:17.069
no, there's no way.

42:17.070 --> 42:18.381
No.

42:18.382 --> 42:19.502
- Jedi's are shitty parents.

42:22.677 --> 42:23.510
- Do you think

42:23.510 --> 42:24.343
that

42:24.344 --> 42:26.415
at like another
bar in this town,

42:26.416 --> 42:28.989
there are girls talking
about Star Trek

42:28.990 --> 42:30.549
like we're talking
about Star Wars.

42:30.550 --> 42:31.739
- No way.

42:31.740 --> 42:33.539
- Yeah, Star Trek is dumb.

42:33.540 --> 42:35.218
- You're right.

42:38.510 --> 42:40.379
- You can have your
Captain Pikard.

42:40.380 --> 42:42.059
You can have your Captain Kirk,

42:42.060 --> 42:43.517
but I'm after that Spock.

42:43.518 --> 42:46.578
There's a reason for
live long and prosper.

42:46.579 --> 42:49.298
I'd put a smile on
that Vulcan's face.

42:49.299 --> 42:50.559
- I understand that.

42:50.560 --> 42:51.619
But I want Mr. Chekov

42:51.620 --> 42:52.879
as I want to make him my first.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.129
You know them virgins.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.439
I want to take him boldly

42:55.440 --> 42:56.899
where no man has gone before.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.221
- Girl.

42:58.222 --> 42:59.219
- You know in can do a little.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.999
- Only you girl.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.317
- I'm telling you,

43:02.318 --> 43:03.357
that's the way it's
supposed to be.

43:03.358 --> 43:04.818
- Cheers.

43:10.155 --> 43:10.988
- You know, I gotta say,

43:10.989 --> 43:12.619
Rent by far is the
greatest musical

43:12.620 --> 43:13.629
ever created.

43:13.630 --> 43:14.679
It has heart.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.799
It's visceral.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.469
And it just moves you
in every way possible.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.869
And also, it really hits home

43:20.870 --> 43:21.860
with all my gay friends

43:21.861 --> 43:23.310
and what they have to endure.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.675
- Les Miserable is the
greatest musical of all time.

43:27.676 --> 43:29.512
It digs into the human spirit,

43:29.513 --> 43:31.249
the struggle.

43:31.250 --> 43:33.138
They yearn to be part
of a higher power,

43:33.139 --> 43:35.261
and the grace of humanity.

43:35.262 --> 43:37.999
- Cats is the best.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.329
I just love it.

43:39.330 --> 43:40.957
Cute little cats running around.

43:40.958 --> 43:44.099
And they don't make me
sneeze like real cats.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.569
- The Music Man,

43:45.570 --> 43:46.729
a light hearted musical

43:46.730 --> 43:47.700
set in Iowa.

43:47.701 --> 43:49.420
It saw the best production of it

43:50.259 --> 43:51.378
at the Cedar Falls
Community Theater

43:51.379 --> 43:52.300
at the.

43:52.301 --> 43:54.119
The Waterloo Community Playhouse

43:54.120 --> 43:56.658
also had a superb
production of it.

43:56.659 --> 43:58.089
- You guys are all wrong.

43:58.090 --> 44:00.877
I'm not trying to
be a dickhead but,

44:00.878 --> 44:03.277
awful selections.

44:03.278 --> 44:05.960
Greese 2 is

44:05.961 --> 44:08.661
profoundly better than everything
you guys have mentioned.

44:13.940 --> 44:15.089
You can roll your eyes,

44:15.090 --> 44:16.742
but it really is.

44:16.743 --> 44:18.239
You're just gonna
have to revisit it.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.623
The Music Man?

44:19.624 --> 44:21.289
I don't mean any disrespect,

44:21.290 --> 44:22.689
I just,

44:22.690 --> 44:23.523
that's like,

44:23.524 --> 44:25.180
it's child's play
for grandparents.

44:25.181 --> 44:26.869
It makes lowans

44:26.870 --> 44:27.884
seem like

44:27.885 --> 44:30.939
frumpy fools that
can't spot a fraud

44:30.940 --> 44:32.163
a half a cornfield away.

44:33.141 --> 44:34.801
It's not any good.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.481
Cats.

44:36.482 --> 44:38.743
Cats.

44:40.270 --> 44:42.524
I don't have enough
scotch for Cats.

44:42.525 --> 44:44.619
Rent man.

44:44.620 --> 44:45.889
Rent's insufferable.

44:45.890 --> 44:46.909
It just, like I get it.

44:46.910 --> 44:48.569
Like I understand the struggle.

44:48.570 --> 44:50.329
Totally sympathize
with the gay community

44:50.330 --> 44:51.739
in New York City during Aids

44:51.740 --> 44:52.573
and persecution,

44:52.574 --> 44:54.982
living in weirdly
shitty apartments.

44:54.983 --> 44:57.269
But really all it did was enable

44:57.270 --> 44:58.339
white sorority sisters

44:58.340 --> 45:01.009
to slaughter more Karaoke songs.

45:01.010 --> 45:02.010
I can't, I can't.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.400
Cats?

45:06.100 --> 45:07.884
Les Mis.

45:07.885 --> 45:10.023
I mean I don't hate it.

45:10.024 --> 45:12.229
I like Anne Hathaway
in the movie.

45:12.230 --> 45:13.160
It's pretty great.

45:13.161 --> 45:14.890
But Jean Valjean

45:15.920 --> 45:17.349
is not

45:17.350 --> 45:18.929
and will never be.

45:18.930 --> 45:19.930
Cool Rider.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.399
In Greese 2, Michael

45:23.400 --> 45:25.884
comes to America with a dream.

45:25.885 --> 45:28.103
He makes his money

45:28.104 --> 45:30.439
writing essays for the

45:30.440 --> 45:32.233
less fortunate folks
at his school.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.389
And he saves his money

45:34.390 --> 45:36.059
and he builds a motorcycle

45:36.060 --> 45:37.509
from scratch.

45:37.510 --> 45:38.803
A cool rider was needed.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.270
He built it from scratch.

45:41.271 --> 45:42.469
He repurposed these parts

45:42.470 --> 45:44.669
and he built them into
something stronger,

45:44.670 --> 45:45.503
faster,

45:45.504 --> 45:47.643
and just beautiful.

45:49.042 --> 45:52.069
I don't know what
else you would want.

45:52.070 --> 45:53.709
It's the American dream

45:53.710 --> 45:55.349
in musical form.

45:55.350 --> 45:57.949
Michelle Phieffer
needed hell on wheels

45:57.950 --> 45:59.479
and by god,

45:59.480 --> 46:00.833
Michael bird hot.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.919
It also has the
best bowling scene

46:03.920 --> 46:05.059
in cinematic history.

46:05.060 --> 46:06.839
It's way better than that trite

46:06.840 --> 46:09.099
gooey Beatles karaoke movie

46:09.100 --> 46:10.869
across the universe.

46:10.870 --> 46:11.899
- Seriously, Harris.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.349
That's the best you
can come up with?

46:13.350 --> 46:15.041
- Please I,

46:15.042 --> 46:15.875
please, I prefer Harold.

46:15.876 --> 46:17.564
- I prefer Harris.

46:17.565 --> 46:18.862
- Okay.

46:18.863 --> 46:20.509
- A couple reasons why
Greese 2 is shit.

46:20.510 --> 46:21.649
First of all,

46:21.650 --> 46:23.429
Michelle Phieffer sounds like

46:23.430 --> 46:25.449
she's got a dead cat
stuck in her throat.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.539
Her singing is atrocious.

46:27.540 --> 46:28.769
- And yet she persevered.

46:28.770 --> 46:29.929
- That was easily
the worst movie

46:29.930 --> 46:30.930
she's ever been in.

46:31.870 --> 46:34.319
Secondly, there's a
production going on right now

46:34.320 --> 46:35.339
called 13.

46:35.340 --> 46:36.459
These kids are in junior high

46:36.460 --> 46:37.719
and they're putting
on something better

46:37.720 --> 46:39.199
than these 30 year olds could.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.400
Last,

46:41.401 --> 46:43.089
these four musicals

46:43.090 --> 46:44.263
were on a stage,

46:44.264 --> 46:45.804
been on Broadway.

46:45.805 --> 46:48.703
Greese 2 has only
been in theaters

46:48.704 --> 46:50.943
and has never won an award.

46:50.944 --> 46:52.429
- Well,

46:52.430 --> 46:53.919
better is the local theater.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.409
They chose to do Greese

46:55.410 --> 46:56.660
instead of the wrong one.

46:58.402 --> 46:59.235
If they would have
got their heads

46:59.236 --> 47:00.286
out of their asses,

47:00.287 --> 47:01.120
they would have
picked the right one,

47:01.120 --> 47:01.980
they would have
found a cool rider

47:01.981 --> 47:03.979
and Harold would have obliged.

47:06.650 --> 47:08.219
- So what are you
drinking there?

47:08.220 --> 47:10.729
- Young lady, I am not drinking

47:10.730 --> 47:11.819
anything.

47:11.820 --> 47:13.259
I am experiencing this

47:13.260 --> 47:15.509
single malt scotch.

47:15.510 --> 47:16.679
- You know,

47:16.680 --> 47:18.239
every time you drink scotch,

47:18.240 --> 47:20.820
it makes me really frisky.

47:21.930 --> 47:24.159
- Well I do suppose that the

47:24.160 --> 47:26.037
experience is different
for everyone.

47:26.038 --> 47:28.619
- Well what are you doing later?

47:28.620 --> 47:29.939
- Young lady,

47:29.940 --> 47:31.139
must I inform you

47:31.140 --> 47:33.163
that I'm wearing my purity ring.

47:34.540 --> 47:36.719
- Why are you wearing
a purity ring?

47:36.720 --> 47:38.339
- Because

47:38.340 --> 47:41.296
purity rings are so cool.

47:42.380 --> 47:44.816
- Cousin Harold.

47:44.817 --> 47:47.275
Are you doubting the

47:47.276 --> 47:49.769
coolness of my purity ring?

47:49.770 --> 47:51.689
- Well if your ear wolf hat

47:51.690 --> 47:52.969
is an indication,

47:52.970 --> 47:53.970
yes, I am.

47:54.657 --> 47:55.490
I've decided that purity rings

47:55.491 --> 47:56.629
are no longer.

47:56.630 --> 47:59.233
- Well then they are no
longer hip for the Oliver.

48:00.620 --> 48:02.849
Young lady may entice away.

48:02.850 --> 48:06.289
- Do you want to experience
my place or yours later?

48:06.290 --> 48:09.399
- Oh, Oliver does not
want to wait that long.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.629
How about

48:10.630 --> 48:12.459
out back behind the dumpster?

48:12.460 --> 48:14.016
- Dumpster fucking?

48:14.017 --> 48:15.329
Yeah.

48:15.330 --> 48:16.349
- Oliver,

48:16.350 --> 48:17.789
please.

48:17.790 --> 48:18.720
- Oh cousin Harold,

48:18.721 --> 48:20.819
I suppose you're right.

48:20.820 --> 48:23.750
How about we go back to my place

48:24.660 --> 48:27.539
and we experience a bottle
of single malt scotch

48:27.540 --> 48:29.136
and I will show you my huge

48:29.137 --> 48:31.259
vinyl collection.

48:31.260 --> 48:33.396
- Okay.

48:33.397 --> 48:34.757
- My work here is done.

48:34.758 --> 48:35.591
- Thank you, cousin Harold.

48:35.591 --> 48:36.591
Thank you.

48:44.556 --> 48:47.216
- Did she say dumpster fucking?

48:47.217 --> 48:49.735
- I believe they said
dumpster fucking.

48:49.736 --> 48:50.569
Have you ever dumpster fucked?

48:50.570 --> 48:52.639
- I've never had
a dumpster fuck,

48:52.640 --> 48:55.077
but I've had a handjob behind
the Tasty Freeze one time.

48:55.078 --> 48:57.647
- That sounds like you.

49:09.162 --> 49:10.694
- You how I feel about
those tractor shots.

49:10.695 --> 49:11.528
It's just kind of like,

49:11.529 --> 49:13.109
actually that guy up there

49:13.110 --> 49:14.110
on the TV.

49:14.111 --> 49:15.799
He seems like a guy who
probably put himself

49:15.800 --> 49:17.278
in his own movies.

49:17.279 --> 49:19.675
- Yeah, multiple movies
on the same subject.

49:19.676 --> 49:22.669
- Always in the same bars,

49:22.670 --> 49:24.052
in the same locations,

49:24.053 --> 49:26.936
and it's always the
same gay dick jokes.

49:26.937 --> 49:28.599
- Constantly.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.149
Because the only thing
this guy finds funny

49:30.150 --> 49:33.177
is dick jokes after a life
of touring and bar hopping.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.119
- Drinking nothing but scotch.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.009
Pretty sure it just
runs through his veins

49:37.010 --> 49:37.920
and he just like

49:37.921 --> 49:39.955
pisses straight scotch.

49:39.956 --> 49:41.589
- Burns all the time.

49:41.590 --> 49:43.715
You can never tell when
he's got the clap.

49:43.716 --> 49:46.299
- I mean I'm sure he's got
some good drugs for that.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.355
But three movies.

49:48.356 --> 49:50.199
Fuck.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.478
Kevin Smith won't even
make a third Clerks.

49:52.479 --> 49:53.673
- Definitely not.

49:55.476 --> 49:57.219
- Strip clubs,

49:57.220 --> 49:58.734
pornography shops,

49:58.735 --> 49:59.710
come on Boss.

49:59.711 --> 50:02.659
There's got to be
something else out there.

50:02.660 --> 50:04.673
- What would you suggest I do?

50:04.674 --> 50:07.619
- Christian bookstores.

50:07.620 --> 50:08.689
- Boss.

50:08.690 --> 50:10.339
This is the Boss.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.439
He owns a strip club

50:11.440 --> 50:13.659
and an adult bookstore in town.

50:13.660 --> 50:15.329
This guy's former boss.

50:15.330 --> 50:17.336
The Adult Shop Mop.

50:17.337 --> 50:19.219
- Okay, the idea of

50:19.220 --> 50:22.396
being in business is
to stay in business.

50:22.397 --> 50:24.019
You realize that, right.

50:24.020 --> 50:26.201
Hey, you're a good kid.

50:26.202 --> 50:27.939
Everybody likes you, Elias.

50:27.940 --> 50:29.739
You know they call
you AA Elias now

50:29.740 --> 50:31.199
cause of that weekend.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.478
But that's okay.

50:32.479 --> 50:33.450
AA's probably good.

50:33.451 --> 50:35.219
Alcoholics anonymous
works for some people

50:35.220 --> 50:36.749
and seems to

50:36.750 --> 50:37.730
work pretty well for you.

50:37.731 --> 50:38.779
And that's good.

50:38.780 --> 50:40.439
Let me pose something to you.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.718
Imagine there's a
good Christian man.

50:42.719 --> 50:44.499
He goes to church

50:44.500 --> 50:46.259
every Wednesday and Sunday.

50:46.260 --> 50:48.019
Goes to bible study,

50:48.020 --> 50:48.900
a great man,

50:48.901 --> 50:50.369
very faithful.

50:50.370 --> 50:52.070
He's driving down
the road one day

50:53.359 --> 50:54.599
on his way to a bible study,

50:54.600 --> 50:55.562
soup kitchen,

50:55.563 --> 50:57.669
what have you.

50:57.670 --> 50:59.337
He gets a tightness
in his chest.

50:59.338 --> 51:02.089
It's pains in his arms.

51:02.090 --> 51:03.977
Realizes he's having
a heart attack,

51:03.978 --> 51:06.361
pulls off to the
very first place

51:06.362 --> 51:07.799
he could find

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
to seek out help.

51:09.690 --> 51:11.999
He dies on the floor
of that business.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.209
Say it's

51:13.210 --> 51:14.729
my adult bookstore

51:14.730 --> 51:16.479
or one of my strip clubs.

51:16.480 --> 51:18.189
The news will read

51:18.190 --> 51:20.699
77 year old man dies
of a heart attack

51:20.700 --> 51:22.129
at 10:00 AM in the morning

51:22.130 --> 51:24.379
at an adult bookstore
or strip club.

51:24.380 --> 51:26.617
You're automatically gonna
think this man is bad.

51:26.618 --> 51:28.689
Let's go the other side.

51:28.690 --> 51:30.429
Imagine there is an awful guy.

51:30.430 --> 51:32.442
A guys that goes to my
strip clubs all the time.

51:32.443 --> 51:34.719
He's at my adult bookstores,

51:34.720 --> 51:36.279
complete porn hound.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.829
A complete reprobate.

51:37.830 --> 51:38.849
A drunk.

51:38.850 --> 51:39.850
A whore monger.

51:41.050 --> 51:42.637
He's driving down
the road one day.

51:42.638 --> 51:44.517
It's a tightness in his chest.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.499
Pains in his arms.

51:46.500 --> 51:48.299
Knows he's gonna
have a heart attack.

51:48.300 --> 51:50.189
Pulls off to the very
first place he can find

51:50.190 --> 51:51.579
to seek out help,

51:51.580 --> 51:53.069
and it's a church.

51:53.070 --> 51:54.439
The news will read

51:54.440 --> 51:55.729
77 year old man

51:55.730 --> 51:57.716
dies of a heart
attack at 10:00 AM

51:57.717 --> 51:59.289
on a Wednesday morning

51:59.290 --> 52:00.529
at a church.

52:00.530 --> 52:03.416
You're automatically
gonna think he's good.

52:03.417 --> 52:05.193
- Well,

52:06.100 --> 52:07.923
at least I tried.

52:09.190 --> 52:11.019
- Always remember this,

52:11.020 --> 52:12.869
amazing grace was
written by an atheist

52:12.870 --> 52:14.289
who was saved.

52:14.290 --> 52:16.149
So never stop trying.

52:16.150 --> 52:16.983
You're good man.

52:16.984 --> 52:18.595
- Thanks Boss.

52:18.596 --> 52:19.598
See you later.

52:19.599 --> 52:20.599
- Bye.

52:28.810 --> 52:30.199
- Praise be.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.529
Last time I saw
an ass like that,

52:31.530 --> 52:33.699
it was carrying our
lord and savior.

52:33.700 --> 52:34.859
- Are you seriously

52:34.860 --> 52:36.479
objectifying her right now?

52:36.480 --> 52:38.729
- No, I'm not objectifying her.

52:38.730 --> 52:40.369
I'm just looking at her ass.

52:40.370 --> 52:41.389
What's up with you broads

52:41.390 --> 52:42.489
making up words and shit.

52:42.490 --> 52:43.360
I'm trying to

52:43.360 --> 52:44.240
get my dick wet.

52:44.241 --> 52:45.939
Talk to you later.

52:45.940 --> 52:46.940
Anyway,

52:47.759 --> 52:49.799
I feel like you can be Columbine

52:49.800 --> 52:51.632
and I decide to shoot a bunch
of kids inside of you.

52:51.633 --> 52:54.109
Hmm?

52:54.110 --> 52:55.389
You know mid 90s,

52:55.390 --> 52:56.409
you're a pog.

52:56.410 --> 52:58.595
I just start slamming that shit.

52:58.596 --> 53:00.379
Maybe you pull a Fonz

53:00.380 --> 53:02.537
and just bang against
the jukebox til.

53:02.538 --> 53:04.199
Incubus plays,

53:04.200 --> 53:05.869
whatever that shit
is you're into.

53:05.870 --> 53:06.850
Kati Perry?

53:06.850 --> 53:07.683
Taylor Swift?

53:07.683 --> 53:08.516
I don't know

53:08.516 --> 53:09.430
how old we are yet.

53:09.431 --> 53:10.890
Can you get a drink?

53:10.891 --> 53:11.780
Do you need a drink?

53:11.781 --> 53:13.049
- Hey Boss.

53:13.050 --> 53:14.609
- Matthew.

53:14.610 --> 53:15.443
- How's it going?

53:15.444 --> 53:16.869
- Kevin, get

53:16.870 --> 53:18.625
this bro a drink on me.

53:18.626 --> 53:21.208
So scotch?

53:21.209 --> 53:22.579
- Definitely.

53:22.580 --> 53:23.753
Definitely scotch.

53:24.612 --> 53:26.611
- I got this Highland
Park viking scotch.

53:26.612 --> 53:28.879
Kevin suggested it.

53:28.880 --> 53:29.713
- Viking's honor.

53:29.713 --> 53:30.713
- Viking's honor.

53:32.290 --> 53:34.349
Good for us Norwegians.

53:34.350 --> 53:36.229
- Yeah, but you know
what's not good for us.

53:36.230 --> 53:38.329
What the fuck is this
AA pamphlet doing here?

53:38.330 --> 53:40.599
AA Elias in here?

53:40.600 --> 53:42.131
- Yeah, he was just in here.

53:42.132 --> 53:44.725
- I thought I saw that
snail trail leading in.

53:44.726 --> 53:46.879
- Oh you heard about
that weekend, huh?

53:46.880 --> 53:48.279
- Yeah.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.545
The bender to remember.

53:49.546 --> 53:50.966
- Alcoholics anonymous

53:50.967 --> 53:53.029
suits people like him.

53:53.030 --> 53:55.029
That was a hell of
a weekend for him.

53:55.030 --> 53:55.863
I mean Jesus,

53:55.864 --> 53:57.267
parents got to him
late Sunday night.

53:57.268 --> 53:58.849
His liver's inflamed.

53:58.850 --> 54:01.369
He's got the worst case of
chlamydia or gonorrhea.

54:01.370 --> 54:04.385
That kid could not handle
a weekend of liqueur.

54:04.386 --> 54:06.059
That was really,

54:06.060 --> 54:07.984
I heard it was an epic weekend.

54:07.985 --> 54:09.309
I heard it was a lot of fun.

54:09.310 --> 54:11.239
- I saw him at the
beginning of that weekend.

54:11.240 --> 54:15.029
He showed up with a
bottle of scotch

54:15.030 --> 54:15.908
ready to roll.

54:15.909 --> 54:17.411
- Oh yeah, he was a ball.

54:17.412 --> 54:20.709
But yeah, I think
alcoholics anonymous

54:20.710 --> 54:23.171
is the correct position for him.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.169
I think that's the

54:24.170 --> 54:25.919
great place for him.

54:25.920 --> 54:27.039
- Hey,

54:27.040 --> 54:28.629
coasters?

54:28.630 --> 54:30.099
- I didn't see any.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.587
Kevin, you got coasters?

54:31.588 --> 54:33.027
- We're all out.

54:39.730 --> 54:40.730
- AA works.

54:41.396 --> 54:42.229
- AA works.

54:42.229 --> 54:43.229
- Alright.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.529
- Do you need someone to
co-sign a loan for you?

54:45.530 --> 54:47.353
I don't know where
you're at in your life.

54:49.260 --> 54:50.759
Would you like to see
how much of my penis

54:50.760 --> 54:51.710
could fit in your mouth?

54:51.711 --> 54:53.519
I think you could almost
get the whole thing.

54:53.520 --> 54:54.749
You seem like you have

54:54.750 --> 54:55.583
like a really

54:55.584 --> 54:57.819
just can do attitude,

54:57.820 --> 54:58.869
you know what I mean.

54:58.870 --> 55:00.349
You're a fighter.

55:00.350 --> 55:01.270
You're a survivor.

55:01.271 --> 55:02.904
- Are you a letter?

55:02.905 --> 55:04.744
- I've been told
that I'm a D before.

55:04.745 --> 55:06.503
So.

55:06.504 --> 55:07.505
- As in a douchebag?

55:07.506 --> 55:08.500
- Like dick.

55:08.501 --> 55:11.709
I don't know if it's a big
one, but it's a pretty cock.

55:11.710 --> 55:12.580
It's nice to look at.

55:12.581 --> 55:13.979
- Anyway.

55:13.980 --> 55:14.900
Since you're a letter,

55:14.901 --> 55:16.584
I'm gonna need you
to C your way out.

55:16.585 --> 55:17.739
- Oh, that's funny.

55:17.740 --> 55:20.937
I'm gonna need to see
you M on those tits.

55:22.562 --> 55:23.565
- I was actually

55:23.566 --> 55:24.470
one of your businesses today.

55:24.471 --> 55:26.009
- Well thank you for
your patronage.

55:26.010 --> 55:27.464
- Yeah.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.309
- That's classic.

55:30.310 --> 55:32.184
Alright, which
place were you at?

55:32.185 --> 55:33.763
- Mini cinema.

55:33.764 --> 55:35.259
- Did you wash your hands

55:35.260 --> 55:36.685
before you shook my hand there?

55:36.686 --> 55:38.744
- Shit.

55:38.745 --> 55:40.525
- That's okay, that's okay.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.749
- So it was weird.

55:43.750 --> 55:44.657
I went in there

55:44.658 --> 55:46.744
and I didn't see
Porn peddler Pete.

55:46.745 --> 55:49.041
- Oh, he doesn't
work for me anymore.

55:49.042 --> 55:52.299
- What happened?

55:52.300 --> 55:54.482
- Well he pirated pornography.

55:54.483 --> 55:56.435
I can't stand for that.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.639
I mean when you
sell pornography,

55:58.640 --> 56:00.159
you have to pay the taxes,

56:00.160 --> 56:01.439
the rights,

56:01.440 --> 56:02.744
all these different
fees towards it.

56:02.745 --> 56:04.499
He didn't do that.

56:04.500 --> 56:05.549
That's not right.

56:05.550 --> 56:07.559
People spend a lot
of time and money

56:07.560 --> 56:08.440
making pornography.

56:08.441 --> 56:10.089
They should be paid

56:10.090 --> 56:11.923
a living wage for such things.

56:11.924 --> 56:15.069
Yeah, so he was
pirating pornography

56:15.070 --> 56:15.950
all over town.

56:15.951 --> 56:17.624
And I found out about it

56:17.625 --> 56:18.560
and I had to let I'm go.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.560
Broke his heart.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.393
He loved that job.

56:20.393 --> 56:21.330
- He did love that job.

56:21.331 --> 56:22.769
Man, this whole time,

56:22.770 --> 56:24.449
everybody thought you
were morally bankrupt.

56:24.450 --> 56:26.542
I guess we were just
in a recession.

56:27.521 --> 56:28.787
- Irony isn't it.

56:28.788 --> 56:30.409
- Now you say it,

56:30.410 --> 56:31.949
now I do remember
something about it.

56:31.950 --> 56:33.919
I heard his house got raided.

56:33.920 --> 56:34.949
Like the police came in,

56:34.950 --> 56:36.156
swat team came in

56:36.157 --> 56:38.504
and they found some
stuff in the basement.

56:38.505 --> 56:40.299
- I didn't hear about this.

56:40.300 --> 56:41.133
What?

56:41.134 --> 56:42.723
- He had an archive
of secret things.

56:42.724 --> 56:45.379
I mean it was almost
like Donnie Darko

56:45.380 --> 56:46.849
and you realize Patrick Swayze

56:46.850 --> 56:47.720
had like the

56:47.721 --> 56:49.489
kiddie porn dungeon in there.

56:49.490 --> 56:50.327
It wasn't like that.

56:50.328 --> 56:52.409
It was a whole nother thing.

56:52.410 --> 56:53.589
Raider porn.

56:53.590 --> 56:54.423
- What's raider?

56:54.423 --> 56:55.290
I've never heard
of a Raider porn.

56:55.290 --> 56:56.290
What's Raider porn?

56:57.510 --> 56:58.969
- It's when white supremacists

56:58.970 --> 57:00.709
have furry parties

57:00.710 --> 57:01.910
and they bang each other

57:03.486 --> 57:04.319
and film it.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.747
- But wait a minute.

57:05.748 --> 57:06.610
How many animals in
the animal kingdom

57:06.611 --> 57:07.689
are actually white?

57:07.690 --> 57:09.085
- Like a snow leopard.

57:09.086 --> 57:10.845
- You got doves.

57:10.846 --> 57:14.693
Like an albino squirrel maybe.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.329
- God man, a polar bear.

57:17.330 --> 57:18.163
- Polar bear.

57:18.164 --> 57:19.405
- Polar bear.

57:19.406 --> 57:20.404
Yeah, polar bear.

57:20.405 --> 57:22.489
- You know when it's
white supremacists

57:22.490 --> 57:24.205
is all in the
missionary position.

57:25.326 --> 57:26.300
So it's gonna be boring as hell.

57:26.300 --> 57:27.133
- But wait a minute,

57:27.134 --> 57:28.439
if a brown bear comes in

57:28.440 --> 57:30.243
it just kind of throws
the whole thing off.

57:30.244 --> 57:31.299
- Yeah.

57:31.300 --> 57:32.961
They ain't letting this guy in.

57:32.962 --> 57:33.981
Come on.

57:33.982 --> 57:35.421
- Imagine he walks in,

57:35.422 --> 57:36.942
do you mind if I dance
with your dates?

57:37.502 --> 57:38.504
- Oh come on,

57:38.505 --> 57:39.502
they're gonna worry about it.

57:39.503 --> 57:40.504
They're gonna produce
some sort of skunk baby

57:40.505 --> 57:41.502
in their minds.

57:41.503 --> 57:42.504
Come on man.

57:42.505 --> 57:43.502
That ain't gonna happen.

57:43.503 --> 57:44.504
- Imagine a neo-Nazi

57:44.505 --> 57:45.502
mid stroke in the
middle of raider porn

57:45.503 --> 57:46.504
and a black bear walks in.

57:46.505 --> 57:48.169
Allah, adult shop mop

57:48.170 --> 57:49.864
and I'm soft.

57:51.270 --> 57:52.130
- I mean hand job

57:52.131 --> 57:53.439
even just,

57:53.440 --> 57:55.139
I watch you, you watch me.

57:55.140 --> 57:55.973
I would

57:55.973 --> 57:56.837
eat ass,

57:56.838 --> 57:58.399
but that would be like

57:58.400 --> 57:59.330
eating at Benny Hannas

57:59.330 --> 58:00.250
from the looks of things.

58:00.250 --> 58:01.170
- Seriously?

58:01.171 --> 58:02.607
- Yeah.

58:02.608 --> 58:03.441
For serious, oh big time.

58:03.441 --> 58:04.274
- This is the best you can
do to pick up a girl?

58:04.275 --> 58:06.023
- I mean,

58:06.024 --> 58:07.830
the next one is either
pull out a wallet

58:07.831 --> 58:11.649
or get you in one of my dad's
Nissan's or something.

58:11.650 --> 58:12.630
I don't know

58:12.631 --> 58:14.230
what you're currently,

58:14.231 --> 58:15.328
your like current APR is

58:15.329 --> 58:16.162
or what your

58:16.163 --> 58:17.349
as far as lease
goes or anything,

58:17.350 --> 58:18.183
but I can get you a car.

58:18.184 --> 58:19.387
I can get you money.

58:19.388 --> 58:22.619
Some fake titties, or something.

58:22.620 --> 58:23.453
Whatever you want,

58:23.453 --> 58:24.286
I would do it for you.

58:24.287 --> 58:26.048
- Dude, I am too good for you.

58:26.049 --> 58:28.004
- There's only one
way to find out.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.088
And a lot of times,

58:29.089 --> 58:29.922
like the big trend right now

58:29.923 --> 58:31.088
I've seen online is for women

58:31.089 --> 58:31.922
to like carry men.

58:31.922 --> 58:32.755
I can be that piece
of shit boyfriend

58:32.756 --> 58:34.089
that all your
friends joke about.

58:34.090 --> 58:34.923
And you know, really though,

58:34.924 --> 58:35.953
when you come home,

58:35.954 --> 58:36.787
I'm...

58:36.787 --> 58:37.620
- Dude, I've been
there, done that, so.

58:37.620 --> 58:38.526
- You haven't done
this yet tough.

58:38.527 --> 58:40.029
- Raider porn.

58:40.030 --> 58:41.339
There's actually raider porn.

58:41.340 --> 58:42.173
That's not a joke?

58:42.174 --> 58:43.507
- No dude.

58:43.508 --> 58:44.508
I'm dead serious.

58:44.509 --> 58:45.509
- Why the hell did he have
raider porn in his basement?

58:45.509 --> 58:46.342
- I don't know man.

58:46.343 --> 58:49.129
He had like some weird, sick
little obsession in there.

58:49.130 --> 58:49.963
And he kept going with it.

58:49.964 --> 58:51.139
- And the cops

58:51.140 --> 58:52.279
came for it.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.451
Oh god.

58:53.452 --> 58:54.285
- They did dude.

58:54.285 --> 58:55.118
- Oh my god.

58:55.119 --> 58:56.939
I bet his nice little
Methodist mother

58:56.940 --> 58:59.729
lost it when she saw
the cops showing up

58:59.730 --> 59:01.050
to get his raider
porn collection.

59:01.051 --> 59:02.592
- He was always in to like

59:02.593 --> 59:03.611
weird figure skating,

59:03.612 --> 59:04.445
but maybe because it's like

59:04.446 --> 59:05.789
usually white petite girls.

59:05.790 --> 59:06.652
- Well he was an interesting,

59:06.653 --> 59:08.469
he was an interesting duck.

59:08.470 --> 59:10.069
- Always kind of floating
through the air,

59:10.070 --> 59:11.030
maybe like a bird.

59:11.031 --> 59:12.230
- A strange kid, a strange kid.

59:12.231 --> 59:13.749
But,

59:13.750 --> 59:15.168
I can forgive all that.

59:15.169 --> 59:17.009
But you don't pirate pornography

59:17.010 --> 59:18.289
because people are
not being paid

59:18.290 --> 59:19.910
the proper taxes,
fees and residuals

59:19.911 --> 59:21.728
that they are entitled to.

59:21.729 --> 59:23.739
But raider porn,

59:23.740 --> 59:25.289
that's a bridge too far.

59:25.290 --> 59:26.928
- Oh my god.

59:26.929 --> 59:29.388
Look at this sack of shit.

59:29.389 --> 59:30.699
Look at him.

59:30.700 --> 59:31.745
- Oh Christ.

59:31.746 --> 59:33.499
That is worse than

59:33.500 --> 59:37.129
having raider porn is being
a stand up comedian.

59:37.130 --> 59:39.659
- I heard that porno
Pete was actually

59:39.660 --> 59:41.239
saying that he was
watching that stuff

59:41.240 --> 59:43.414
to build up a stand
up comedy act.

59:43.415 --> 59:44.719
- So his

59:44.720 --> 59:47.712
excuse was I have a raider
porn collection to...

59:47.713 --> 59:50.559
- Work on a bit.

59:50.560 --> 59:51.759
- To work on a bit.

59:51.760 --> 59:53.609
I think I'd rather
be a porn hound

59:53.610 --> 59:55.152
than be a stand up comedian.

59:55.153 --> 59:55.986
That is like the
lowest of the low.

59:55.987 --> 59:57.226
- God, can you imagine what
it would have been like

59:57.227 --> 59:59.129
if we had to go around like

59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.670
the community...

01:00:00.671 --> 01:00:01.671
- You had to go door to door

01:00:01.672 --> 01:00:03.072
and tell everybody
he was a standup.

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:05.699
I'm sorry.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.268
I'm Pete, I live down at...

01:00:07.269 --> 01:00:09.449
- I live within your community.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:10.283
- Oh my god.

01:00:10.284 --> 01:00:12.054
What was his Methodist
more upset about?

01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:13.639
The fact that he was

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.891
peddling porn and
pirating it all over town

01:00:15.892 --> 01:00:18.229
or that he's gonna be
a stand up comedian?

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.209
- Dude, I don't know.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.210
It's got.

01:00:23.031 --> 01:00:24.230
Oh my god.

01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:25.270
- Speaking, yeah, Jesus,

01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:26.272
speaking of the devil,

01:00:26.273 --> 01:00:27.271
look at that sack of shit.

01:00:27.272 --> 01:00:28.294
Oh my god.

01:00:28.295 --> 01:00:29.292
- Oh my god.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.372
How embarrassing would that be.

01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:31.574
- See,

01:00:31.575 --> 01:00:34.839
I bet his parents are so proud.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.673
Oh my god.

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:36.729
- Oh yeah, definitely.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.779
That guys is just driving like

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.639
a red mustang

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.149
with a canvas top convertible.

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:43.819
Not even a V8, a V6.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.700
Automatic.

01:00:44.701 --> 01:00:46.309
- It was a V8.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.331
I hope I'm never

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:51.094
that low that I have to
do something like that

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:52.299
to garner attention.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.609
- Oh dude.

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:55.232
I'd rather be sucking dick
from behind in the alley

01:00:55.233 --> 01:00:57.409
making decent wage off of that

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:58.879
than to ever have to
speak any kind of

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.449
words into a microphone.

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.949
- Matt, please, let's
make a promise

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:04.339
that we never, ever have
to do standup comedy.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.340
- Yeah.

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.152
- Real quick, bathroom,
three minutes.

01:01:11.153 --> 01:01:12.169
- I don't want to.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.174
- Behind this jukebox?

01:01:13.175 --> 01:01:14.170
We fucking pull this thing out.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.174
- I really don't want to.

01:01:15.175 --> 01:01:16.040
- That's okay.

01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:17.396
I'll watch you do some stuff.

01:01:17.397 --> 01:01:19.989
- Indeed rather have the
Bros two times over

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.689
than I'd have you.

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:23.409
- That'd probably
feel about the same.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:24.934
You got a little

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:26.522
nubby nubby in each hand.

01:01:26.523 --> 01:01:27.734
A little corn holder.

01:01:27.735 --> 01:01:29.019
If that's what you want,

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.533
I'll arrange it.

01:01:30.534 --> 01:01:31.367
I know them.

01:01:31.368 --> 01:01:32.534
- They don't like you though.

01:01:32.535 --> 01:01:34.002
- No one really
does, but I mean.

01:01:34.003 --> 01:01:35.129
- Then why are you here?

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:38.539
If no one likes you,
then why are you here?

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.134
Why don't you go fuck off?

01:01:40.135 --> 01:01:42.192
Back to Douche land?

01:01:42.193 --> 01:01:43.449
- I will do that.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.999
If you change your mind,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.219
- I'll be over here.
- I won't.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.111
- That's okay.

01:01:47.112 --> 01:01:48.132
- You might.
- So fuck off.

01:01:48.133 --> 01:01:48.966
- I've got that thing

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:49.799
in the back of your mind.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.849
You'll be thinking about it.

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:51.683
- Nope.
- Think about it.

01:01:51.684 --> 01:01:53.064
- Fuck off.

01:01:53.065 --> 01:01:55.389
- God.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:56.609
I can't get any pussy
in this place.

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:58.349
I might as well go fucking
kings and queens.

01:01:58.350 --> 01:01:59.659
- Jesus Christ dude,

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.426
you're objectifying that sliz.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:03.109
- What does that even mean?

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.249
Objectifying?

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.943
You sound like one
of those broads man.

01:02:05.944 --> 01:02:07.211
- You know,

01:02:07.212 --> 01:02:08.799
loose morals,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.751
a little bit of loose action.

01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:10.584
That's what I mean.

01:02:10.585 --> 01:02:13.339
- Yeah, then objectifying I was.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.719
It's my objective all
night to do that.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.322
Trying to find some clam, man.

01:02:17.323 --> 01:02:18.230
A little slam clam.

01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.230
Clam digger.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.059
Anything I can do
to muff some duff.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.459
- I didn't realize your
a shoreman yourself.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.569
Nectar Wookie,

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:26.899
a lifeless idiot

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:27.880
whose whole existence

01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:30.150
consists of following around
bands like Base Nectar.

01:02:30.151 --> 01:02:32.699
When they're not out
selling bunk drugs,

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.599
veggie burritos and
grilled cheese,

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.189
they're often swiping drinks

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.729
and trying to borrow
literally everything

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.599
at music festivals.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.829
A Nectar Wookie is the
natural enemy of a hipster,

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:45.379
kind of like in Twilight

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.254
with the vampires
and werewolves.

01:02:47.255 --> 01:02:50.909
Hey, Kristen Steward is a jew.

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.999
Why else would she get
with a 100 year old guy

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.811
with a nice german car?

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:00.589
- I don't mean to cause alarm,

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:02.912
but doth my nostrils deceive me,

01:03:02.913 --> 01:03:05.509
we have a nectar wookie

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:06.510
in our midst.

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:10.479
- Oh, I'm sorry yeah.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.313
That's me.

01:03:11.314 --> 01:03:12.811
I haven't,

01:03:12.812 --> 01:03:14.208
I haven't showered
in a few weeks, so.

01:03:14.209 --> 01:03:16.870
- Also, Bonoroo has a
bathroom in a few weeks.

01:03:16.871 --> 01:03:18.919
- No, that's,

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.672
that's actually next week,

01:03:20.673 --> 01:03:22.192
I'm pretty sure.

01:03:22.193 --> 01:03:23.202
Yeah.

01:03:23.203 --> 01:03:24.813
- I don't have marijuana.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.023
That drink was not yours.

01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:31.769
Bonoroo is that way.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.259
- Oh, okay.

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.879
- Yeah, Phish is about
to take the stage man.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.919
You should go.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.149
- Guess what,

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:38.040
guess what,

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.139
Base Nectar

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.719
not on the jukebox.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.099
How about you dubstep

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.379
walk away from the situation

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.949
you fucking wookie.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:45.790
- Jesus, okay.

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.623
I'm sorry.

01:03:46.624 --> 01:03:48.149
- Stay the fuck out
of gong fu, okay.

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:49.328
- By the way,

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:51.190
you guys have any mushrooms?

01:03:51.191 --> 01:03:52.308
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:53.290
We don't have anything.

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.490
- Fucking Mark Walberg
in Rock Star.

01:03:57.964 --> 01:03:59.029
- That's not a bad
movie, honestly.

01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:01.081
- Hey, did you see what
happened to my drink?

01:04:01.082 --> 01:04:03.119
- Sorry man.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.169
The fucking woff took it.

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:06.003
- Sorry man.

01:04:06.004 --> 01:04:07.259
- Thanks for looking out, man.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.523
Bartender, get these
bros a drink on me.

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.459
- So bros, it's last call.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.949
What are you thinking?

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:15.979
- Scotch.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.149
- Scotch.

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:18.439
- Scotch?

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.273
- Scotch.

01:04:19.274 --> 01:04:20.442
- Scotch.

01:04:20.443 --> 01:04:21.446
- Better not be Doers.

01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:22.444
- Alright, bros,

01:04:22.445 --> 01:04:23.601
this is Singleton,

01:04:23.602 --> 01:04:24.652
the Glenlive 12 year,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.779
single malt.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.919
You know about that, Harold.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.033
- Hey, it's not Doers
guys, we're good.

01:04:32.983 --> 01:04:34.143
- We'll pour it neat.

01:04:34.723 --> 01:04:36.785
- You know what that means?

01:04:36.786 --> 01:04:37.619
- No.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.705
- Harold.

01:04:38.706 --> 01:04:40.187
- Yes?

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:42.369
- You're pouring
it really quick.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:43.641
That's neat man.

01:04:43.642 --> 01:04:45.193
Neato.

01:04:48.082 --> 01:04:48.915
- What I'm gonna do now

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.801
is I'm gonna put a
couple drops of water

01:04:50.802 --> 01:04:51.635
in each one.

01:04:51.636 --> 01:04:53.499
It changes the
molecular density.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500
It opens it up.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.769
- Like a bouquet.

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:57.999
- Exactly.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.319
- Like a lady's legs.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.770
- With the best water

01:05:01.724 --> 01:05:02.570
in the valley.

01:05:02.571 --> 01:05:04.389
Actually in the world.

01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:05.390
- Yep.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:08.158
- Best hangover cure

01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:09.589
right there.

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:11.229
Water.

01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:13.280
- I wish we had some
Roy Orbesen records.

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:23.377
Is that how you
discard your scotch?

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.142
- Yeah, is there another way?

01:05:25.143 --> 01:05:26.799
- My god, you're still doing

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.449
fucking Big League Chew?

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.283
- Fucking A right man,

01:05:29.284 --> 01:05:30.561
cause I'm a pro.

01:05:30.562 --> 01:05:31.598
- We should have
given him Doers.

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:35.745
- What is the next
plan of attack?

01:05:35.746 --> 01:05:37.599
Cause this is a lot of
fun and all, but...

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.281
- I have a Lyft.

01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:40.881
- Who?

01:05:40.882 --> 01:05:43.079
- Somebody named Ling.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.099
- No.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.100
No, no, no, no.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:47.629
Trust me.

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:49.649
I got pepper sprayed
by that broad.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:50.779
No.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.081
- I'm from Brooklyn,
you motherfucker.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:53.050
- Wait, wait,

01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:54.742
there's a Brooklyn in China?

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:56.843
- I sprayed her with my pepper.

01:05:56.844 --> 01:05:58.866
- Oh, I think I heard of that.

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:01.119
Did she join AA
Elias after that?

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.709
- Oh hell yeah, she did.

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:03.543
- Okay.

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:04.763
- Oh yeah.

01:06:04.764 --> 01:06:05.949
- Yeah I'd sober up if I
had to bang this guy.

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:06.783
- I'm just saying,

01:06:06.783 --> 01:06:07.616
if I had my dick inside you you,

01:06:07.617 --> 01:06:09.323
your gonna make some good
positive changes in life.

01:06:09.324 --> 01:06:10.599
- My god.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.059
Look, I'm gonna get on.

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.010
Uber right now.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:14.979
I know I'm not gonna get
in the fucking Uber Jew.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.159
- Oh, the Uber Jew.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.289
Yah.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:18.449
- Uber Jew?

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:19.283
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:19.284 --> 01:06:20.799
- It seems a little

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.305
antisemitic and maybe
a bit tasteless.

01:06:22.306 --> 01:06:23.909
- Oh my god.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:27.409
It's not like I fucking called
in the sheeny shuttler.

01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:29.803
Fucking kike cart dude.

01:06:29.804 --> 01:06:31.559
Oh my god dude.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.239
- I'm on the old hieve highway.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.613
- Hey,

01:06:37.858 --> 01:06:38.850
- I wouldn't say I'm gay.

01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:41.361
But I've definitely done
some gay shit, dude.

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:43.294
- Yeah you have.

01:06:43.295 --> 01:06:44.223
- Yeah.

01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:45.259
- We're fully aware.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.161
- You haven't?

01:06:47.162 --> 01:06:50.469
No?

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:51.935
- No.

01:06:51.936 --> 01:06:52.884
- Harold was never

01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:54.177
partook in homosexual.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.011
- You're gonna tell
me with that jacket,

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:57.573
and that beard you guys have
never done anything gay?

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.883
- Maybe watched the WNBA.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.374
- I would tell you,

01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:06.574
if you got more in touch

01:07:06.575 --> 01:07:07.408
with your male side,

01:07:07.409 --> 01:07:08.679
you might have,

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.513
I don't know,

01:07:09.514 --> 01:07:11.052
more luck getting women.

01:07:11.053 --> 01:07:12.739
- I actually prefer the WNBA.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.195
It's more a team sport.

01:07:16.091 --> 01:07:17.649
- The only reason you
like watching the WNBA

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:18.969
is because a lot of those ladies

01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:20.229
have Adam's apples.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:21.598
- I really appreciate
their talent.

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:22.590
- God, would you be in to it

01:07:22.591 --> 01:07:23.869
if they did?

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.338
- No, dude.

01:07:25.339 --> 01:07:27.669
I'm like a fucking
ancient Roman warrior.

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.069
That is the only reason why
me and my other male friends

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.939
have bonded in the
way that we have.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.399
I wouldn't say it's
anything sexual about it.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.459
It's more about

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.819
becoming brothers,

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.238
becoming closer than
you ever could.

01:07:38.239 --> 01:07:39.357
Someone's life in your hands,

01:07:39.358 --> 01:07:41.553
you want to really
trust somebody,

01:07:41.554 --> 01:07:43.515
jerk that dick off.

01:07:43.516 --> 01:07:44.410
You know what I mean.

01:07:44.411 --> 01:07:46.219
You really learn a
lot about somebody.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.678
- Achilles and
Hector, you are not.

01:07:47.679 --> 01:07:49.349
- No, hell no.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:51.459
I'm not gonna die because the
back of my fucking ankle

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.390
gets tweaked.

01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:53.655
You know what I mean.

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:56.355
No, I'm

01:07:56.356 --> 01:07:57.739
like Brad Pitt,

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.395
but more like Brad
Pitt in Snatch.

01:07:59.396 --> 01:08:00.739
You know what the fuck I mean.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.289
- You like dikes?

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.575
- Yeah.

01:08:03.576 --> 01:08:04.420
Do I like dikes?

01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:05.715
Or docks?

01:08:05.716 --> 01:08:06.718
- Guys.

01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:07.552
You like guys?

01:08:07.553 --> 01:08:09.599
- Eh, I wouldn't
say I like them,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.039
but if you've never had
a dude jerk you off,

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.577
you haven't lived.

01:08:13.578 --> 01:08:15.319
The textile strength
that a man has

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.259
is so much better
than a woman's.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.819
- Those calluses.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:21.049
- It's like getting
a fucking handjob

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:22.937
from a ranch hand, you
know what I mean.

01:08:22.938 --> 01:08:26.537
Just a good firm old
Midwestern hand shake.

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:29.417
You know what I'm talking about.

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:30.618
In fact,

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.453
let me show you.

01:08:31.453 --> 01:08:32.889
From what I've learned by,

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:33.723
I don't know,

01:08:33.724 --> 01:08:35.118
being amongst my fellow men,

01:08:35.118 --> 01:08:37.209
I'm gonna teach that
lady over there

01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:38.752
a thing or two

01:08:38.752 --> 01:08:40.094
she's never seen.

01:08:41.108 --> 01:08:43.278
I'm gonna get her to
suck my whole penis.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.296
- Her?

01:08:44.298 --> 01:08:45.295
- Yeah.

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:46.127
- Her?
- Yeah.

01:08:46.129 --> 01:08:47.314
Tiddle biddies over there.

01:08:47.316 --> 01:08:48.318
- Her?

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.316
- Her?

01:08:49.317 --> 01:08:50.334
- Yes, let me,

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.167
let me show you guys, okay.

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.769
I'm, this is gonna be.

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:54.698
Trojan warrior

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.553
and that's my young squire.

01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:58.510
- This is the
moment where Harold

01:08:58.511 --> 01:09:00.923
is continually baffled
at how we are friends.

01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:02.832
- Let me give you a
piece of advice.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.139
- I wouldn't recommend this.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.395
- I would not recommend this.

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:06.493
- Why?

01:09:08.474 --> 01:09:10.029
She's too easy.

01:09:10.029 --> 01:09:11.234
It's too easy of a kill?

01:09:11.236 --> 01:09:13.209
It's like hunting
a wounded deer?

01:09:13.210 --> 01:09:14.130
That's fine.

01:09:14.131 --> 01:09:15.335
That's all I fucking hunt,

01:09:15.336 --> 01:09:16.755
you know what I mean.

01:09:16.756 --> 01:09:17.754
- I think Tyler
needs a challenge.

01:09:17.755 --> 01:09:20.368
- I'll accept roadkill.

01:09:20.370 --> 01:09:21.359
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:21.361 --> 01:09:22.719
- Okay.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.099
- How about just enough funds

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.050
to go malt scotch

01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:26.792
to appreciate this moment.

01:09:26.794 --> 01:09:27.729
- You guys keep my seat warm.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:29.488
I'll be getting my dick wet.

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:30.323
When I get back,

01:09:30.323 --> 01:09:31.809
you guys can help dab it off

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:32.643
and tell me how great we did.

01:09:32.644 --> 01:09:34.350
- He's always so rude.

01:09:36.529 --> 01:09:37.363
I'm not a prude,

01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:39.223
but I can see him
appreciating the crude.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.461
- What's up girl?

01:09:44.462 --> 01:09:45.295
Get you a drink?

01:09:45.295 --> 01:09:46.127
- Yeah.

01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:46.961
Like Red Bulls over here, baby.

01:09:46.962 --> 01:09:48.118
- Sure, I love to smash
Red Bull vodkas with you

01:09:48.118 --> 01:09:49.340
all night

01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:52.395
and then you can
fuck me doggie style

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.720
while we watch the new season
of Blue Mountain State.

01:09:54.721 --> 01:09:57.644
Do you like Nickleback
as much as I do?

01:09:57.645 --> 01:09:58.478
- Yes.

01:09:58.478 --> 01:09:59.311
- Yeah.
- Oh my god, yeah.

01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:00.144
- I fucking love Tool.

01:10:00.144 --> 01:10:01.144
Yeah.

01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:04.150
- Pull my hair.

01:10:05.218 --> 01:10:07.100
- You're towing my toolbox baby.

01:10:07.101 --> 01:10:08.358
- Oh god.

01:10:08.359 --> 01:10:09.737
Get this little tool
out right here.

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:12.071
- Why do you call it little?

01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:15.951
- Damn, can I get a couple
vodka red bulls on her please?

01:10:15.952 --> 01:10:18.493
- Wow, seriously?

01:10:18.494 --> 01:10:19.327
- Uh uh.

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:21.177
- Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:10:21.178 --> 01:10:23.539
Do you think I'm just
some little tool shed

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.426
you can do whatever the
fuck you want with?

01:10:24.427 --> 01:10:29.426
God, you are such a
typical Cedar Falls WASP

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:31.889
who probably only got
through high school

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:33.921
on the fact that daddy
owned a car dealership.

01:10:33.922 --> 01:10:35.780
How many freshmen cheerleaders

01:10:35.781 --> 01:10:38.129
have you had your dirty
little fingers in

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.519
after a lacrosse game?

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.357
Huh?

01:10:40.358 --> 01:10:41.669
Go home.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.289
Yeah, I can smell
them from here.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:44.270
Go home,

01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:46.039
wash off the Axe body spray

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.779
and wait for the next
time that your mom

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.889
signs you up

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:49.989
for a bachelor date night

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:51.893
at your town's failing
country club.

01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:53.680
- Wow.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.513
You blew it.

01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:56.063
Guess who played piccolo
their freshman year.

01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:57.588
Peace.

01:10:57.589 --> 01:10:58.628
- Whatever.

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:01.779
Small penis.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:03.159
- It's bigger than yours.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.929
- I can't even see it
through your jeans.

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:06.713
Get out of here.

01:11:06.714 --> 01:11:07.789
- That's cause they're dark.

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.451
- Oh, what gives Charlie Brown?

01:11:10.452 --> 01:11:12.028
- Fuck you man.

01:11:12.029 --> 01:11:14.612
I struck out.

01:11:14.613 --> 01:11:15.446
- Her?

01:11:15.447 --> 01:11:16.612
With her?

01:11:16.613 --> 01:11:17.673
- Her?

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:18.520
- Yeah, I struck out with her.

01:11:18.521 --> 01:11:19.819
What's happened to me?

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.653
- Fuck this.

01:11:20.654 --> 01:11:22.486
- Like pirates

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:23.499
- I think it was Kirk tonight.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500
- Guys.

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:26.750
I'm calling in the
nuclear option.

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:28.339
- No.

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.709
Not the man who's had more girls

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:30.990
than anyone in Cedar Valley.

01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:31.980
- Yes.

01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:33.599
The sultan of sliz himself.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.252
- I do admire that
man's sexual prowess.

01:11:35.253 --> 01:11:38.579
- And send.

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.890
- She's doomed.
- Oh boy.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.073
- Sir, you have a message.

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.414
- Tyler,

01:12:23.415 --> 01:12:24.516
Matt,

01:12:24.517 --> 01:12:25.518
Harold.

01:12:25.519 --> 01:12:26.533
- Mr. Lance.

01:12:26.534 --> 01:12:27.519
Now might be a real good time

01:12:27.519 --> 01:12:28.352
for you to get horny.

01:12:28.353 --> 01:12:29.809
- It's my secret, Matt.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:30.643
I'm always horny.

01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:31.519
- Mr. Lance.
- So cool.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.076
- He called me Harold.

01:12:35.077 --> 01:12:36.077
- Oh my god.

01:12:37.039 --> 01:12:38.739
Are you Jeff Lance?

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.433
- You're goddamn right.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:48.656
Bros, Jeff Lance.

01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:54.890
- So what are you guys
doing after this?

01:12:54.891 --> 01:12:56.649
- Going to Cornstalk
at Spicoli's.

01:12:56.650 --> 01:12:57.483
- Oh really.

01:12:57.484 --> 01:13:00.309
- I heard Carolina
Spine is playing.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:01.449
- Caroline.

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:02.450
Spine.

01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:04.039
- Caroline.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.179
- Spine.
- Get it right.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.764
- I'm sorry.

01:13:06.765 --> 01:13:07.690
- You know that song
about Waterloo, right.

01:13:07.691 --> 01:13:08.940
- Yes, called Mrs. Sullivan.

01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:11.529
- Okay, so like about this
Sullivan brothers and

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:13.841
all that jazz.

01:13:13.842 --> 01:13:15.143
Okay, okay.

01:13:15.144 --> 01:13:16.439
- So oh my god, right,

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.273
we gotta go.

01:13:17.274 --> 01:13:18.444
- Yep, gotta go.

01:13:18.445 --> 01:13:19.442
- Let's do this.

01:13:19.443 --> 01:13:21.173
- Carolina Spine.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.709
- Alright guys seriously,

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.049
get on the fucking horns.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:27.069
We need a driver.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.159
We gotta get down man.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.289
Caroline's Spine.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.290
- Okay, got it.

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:32.639
- Look at this, the initiative,

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.081
I love it.

01:13:34.082 --> 01:13:35.064
Tyler the tool.

01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:36.140
Does that say fucking Grinder?

01:13:36.141 --> 01:13:37.050
- Yeah dude,

01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:38.419
trying to get my
butt hole licked.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.879
- Can't meet a woman
with a tongue strength

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.149
that I require.

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.789
- Tyler,

01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:44.160
cool it with the
butt stuff, bros.

01:13:44.161 --> 01:13:46.359
I've done it.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.589
- You got a ride?

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.639
- I'm a miracle worker.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.899
- It can't be Lyft.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.509
- Doth my eyes deceive me.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.410
- There's this asian lady,

01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:53.879
I climbed her great wall

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.489
like I was Mongolian.

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:57.201
Genghis Khan up in that bitch.

01:13:57.202 --> 01:13:58.070
- This,

01:13:58.071 --> 01:13:59.420
this is as poetic
as Silvia Plath.

01:13:59.421 --> 01:14:00.809
It is.

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:01.643
- Silvia Plath?

01:14:01.644 --> 01:14:03.109
- It most certainly is.

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.449
- The chick that
wrote Frankenstein?

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:06.489
- Harold's eyes doth
not deceive him.

01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:07.490
- Oh my god.

01:14:08.962 --> 01:14:09.840
They should have sent a poet.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.840
- They did.

01:14:11.682 --> 01:14:13.639
- Like Robert Frost?

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.633
- It's gold doth stay.

01:14:19.298 --> 01:14:21.169
- The Uber Jew,

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:22.329
the Jewish Uber driver

01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:23.749
who is very Jewish,

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.519
hence he is.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.370
Uber Jew,

01:14:26.371 --> 01:14:29.389
the greatest uber driver ever.

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.141
Fucking love that hebe.

01:14:31.142 --> 01:14:33.699
Hey, he

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.429
who finds faithful friend

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.163
finds a treasure.

01:14:37.164 --> 01:14:39.061
That's a Jewish proverb.

01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:40.473
- Hey,

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.649
Bros got room for one more?

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:47.650
- Tanner!

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:48.650
- Hey.

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:54.139
- Turtles Reunion tour?

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.360
- You got to sit in the back.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.741
- You got to sit bitch.

01:15:00.742 --> 01:15:02.389
- Okay.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:03.541
- Oh my god.

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.621
There hasn't been

01:15:05.622 --> 01:15:06.622
anyone

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:09.359
as happy to see a Jew

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:10.193
since I don't know,

01:15:10.194 --> 01:15:12.427
the disciples on first Easter.

01:15:12.428 --> 01:15:15.045
- Starting with that
right away, huh.

01:15:15.046 --> 01:15:18.404
- Wait, so why are
you back here again?

01:15:18.405 --> 01:15:20.564
- Well, I moved back.

01:15:20.565 --> 01:15:22.403
The cost of living in

01:15:22.404 --> 01:15:24.029
Chicago was a little
too high for me.

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.966
- Were you really
in Chicago though?

01:15:25.967 --> 01:15:27.485
Were you in Logan Square?

01:15:27.486 --> 01:15:29.648
- I don't believe we've met.
- Or more like Evanston?

01:15:29.649 --> 01:15:31.947
- Well Schaumburg actually.

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:33.469
- I'm Harold.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.759
No, we have not
had the pleasure.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.670
- Yeah, I was gonna say

01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:37.249
I would remember that beard.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:39.008
- Is it reminiscent
of mahogany and ash?

01:15:39.009 --> 01:15:41.605
- No.

01:15:41.606 --> 01:15:44.219
- Dude, that fucking
hat is sick.

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.709
I gotta get me one of those

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:47.344
with gold on it.

01:15:47.345 --> 01:15:48.347
And instead of the star,

01:15:48.348 --> 01:15:49.365
maybe use something like a knife

01:15:49.366 --> 01:15:50.804
or like a or something.

01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:53.147
- I think that would
be a little much.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.944
You know I have to say,

01:15:54.945 --> 01:15:56.384
I'm a little surprised.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.382
- Oh.

01:15:57.383 --> 01:15:58.421
- To see

01:15:58.422 --> 01:15:59.643
a hipster,

01:15:59.644 --> 01:16:00.661
a tool,

01:16:00.662 --> 01:16:01.809
and bros all in the same car.

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.705
I'm a little proud of you guys.

01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:03.702
I am.

01:16:03.702 --> 01:16:04.535
- Is it breaking your heart

01:16:04.536 --> 01:16:05.856
that we're ride
sharing right now?

01:16:07.302 --> 01:16:08.329
- Kind of makes you wonder why

01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:09.939
Israel and Palestine
can't get along.

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.449
- You know, there's
actually more to that.

01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:12.896
- I know.

01:16:12.897 --> 01:16:14.119
- And just like that crystal

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.389
knocked the whole
coverup bullshit

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:17.519
you guys came up with.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.899
I know a fucking scam

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.169
when you're trying to get that

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.699
window pane insurance money.

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.540
My dad sold them.

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.879
I know that he...

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.039
- Hey Tyler,

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.409
Crystal knock knock.

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:27.243
- Who's there?

01:16:27.244 --> 01:16:28.480
- An inside job.

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:31.984
- And six million less Jews.

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:35.559
- You guys have not
changed one bit.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.490
- Why did you come back.

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.969
You were with your
bubby you said.

01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:39.649
And you were gonna
work for your uncle.

01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:40.759
- Well,

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.080
it ended up not working out.

01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:43.899
- Is it bubby or booby?

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:44.900
- I'm not as good with the money

01:16:44.901 --> 01:16:46.581
as I thought I was.

01:16:47.585 --> 01:16:48.582
- That's the first you

01:16:48.583 --> 01:16:49.584
I will ever admit that joke.

01:16:49.585 --> 01:16:50.582
- So you weren't quite
making six figures?

01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:52.729
- We won't talk about it.

01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:54.341
- They can't even
make six inches.

01:16:55.622 --> 01:16:56.869
- What are you doing?

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:58.069
Just rubbing nickles together

01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:59.664
to making our money or what?

01:16:59.665 --> 01:17:02.209
- Oh, I've missed you guys.

01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:03.249
I really have.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.829
- I just can't believe
we found you on the app.

01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:06.259
It was a Christmas miracle.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.789
Oh sorry, a Hanukkah miracle.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.264
- Yes.

01:17:09.265 --> 01:17:10.098
- Does Hanukkah have miracles?

01:17:10.098 --> 01:17:10.940
- You can say Christmas.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:11.820
I'm not offended.

01:17:11.821 --> 01:17:13.403
- I don't want to offend.

01:17:13.404 --> 01:17:15.009
I just want to be
historically accurate.

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.549
- We're not offended
that you killed Christ.

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:19.403
- You know I really
love riding with you.

01:17:19.404 --> 01:17:22.052
You give us road scotch.

01:17:22.053 --> 01:17:22.970
- Road scotch.

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.069
- Jesus Christ,

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:25.119
Glen Levit.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.619
- At least it's single malt.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.453
- Yeah.

01:17:27.454 --> 01:17:28.479
- What, were they out
of Cutty Sark or what?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.313
- Hey, you never
know when someone's

01:17:29.314 --> 01:17:30.759
gonna stiff you.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.186
I can't reach for the top shelf.

01:17:32.187 --> 01:17:33.759
- You're like fucking Pauly

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.158
drinking.

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:35.992
- Even the middle shelf.

01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:37.573
- Like that time
Piccolo's had Doers.

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:40.279
Jesus.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.113
- I thought they
didn't have Doers.

01:17:41.114 --> 01:17:42.609
I thought they had

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:43.470
like Lauders.

01:17:43.471 --> 01:17:44.889
- Harold had water that evening.

01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:45.890
- Yeah.

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:57.295
- What's your middle name?

01:17:57.296 --> 01:17:58.457
- What's your date of birth?

01:17:58.458 --> 01:17:59.340
- Oh my goodness,

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.958
I do not have time
for this, okay.

01:18:00.959 --> 01:18:02.609
I work two jobs,

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:03.490
got a kid.

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:04.480
I'm getting crow's feet.

01:18:04.481 --> 01:18:05.897
Okay, I just want to
go to the concert.

01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:09.054
- Hmm, well head on in.

01:18:09.055 --> 01:18:10.638
- Sounds good to me.

01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:12.414
- She looks pretty good for 46.

01:18:12.415 --> 01:18:14.215
- 105.7 KOKZ,

01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:15.200
Iowa's classic hits.

01:18:15.201 --> 01:18:16.916
My name is Craig Lowey.

01:18:16.917 --> 01:18:17.750
You know where you
need to be tonight.

01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:19.279
You need to be at
Spicoli's in Waterloo

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.489
because a fantastic
band is coming to town.

01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:23.609
Jimmy Newquist and
Caroline's Spine

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:25.167
are gonna be in town.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:26.001
I know these guys
for a long time.

01:18:26.002 --> 01:18:27.129
They have the hit song,

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:28.419
Sullivan, among others.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:29.589
We definitely want
you to get out

01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:30.440
and support

01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:31.449
not only Spicoli's,

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:32.826
but Jimmy Newquist and
Caroline's Spine.

01:18:32.827 --> 01:18:34.589
If you've never seen them live,

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.169
you are certainly missing out.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:37.172
And we want you to experience.

01:18:37.173 --> 01:18:39.019
Caroline's Spine tonight,

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:39.853
Spicoli's in Waterloo.

01:18:39.854 --> 01:18:40.889
Check it out.

01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.472
- Erin McCool.

01:18:42.473 --> 01:18:44.399
My life changed.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:45.854
How are you?

01:18:45.855 --> 01:18:47.310
- Cool dude.

01:18:47.311 --> 01:18:50.397
- I prefer a handshake.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.439
- Hey guys, this
is James Patrick

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:57.370
at Rock 108.

So make sure you're

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.233
- Harry, how's it going?

01:19:08.234 --> 01:19:10.349
- It's be better if
you'd call me Harold.

01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:11.183
- I keep forgetting.

01:19:11.184 --> 01:19:12.873

- Well Harold, I got
something special for you.

01:19:14.186 --> 01:19:15.150
Here's something that
you'll actually prefer

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:16.449
more than our water selection.

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:17.283
- Or your Doers?

01:19:17.283 --> 01:19:18.283

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:21.689
Alright, would Harold
approve of this?

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.889

01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:28.009
