10:04.995 --> 10:06.780
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OLD
6-CYLINDER PISTON ENGINE.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.738
HENRY: MADE SOME CALLS
AND THERE'S ONLY

10:08.782 --> 10:11.001
ONE LOCAL TOUR COMPANY
THAT STILL USES
THAT TYPE OF HELICOPTER.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.960
AND YOU NEED ME TO
ACCESS THE COMPANY'S
FLIGHT PATHS

10:13.003 --> 10:14.918
TO DETERMINE WHERE
THE CALL WAS COMING FROM.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.572
NICKY: EXACTLY.
ALTHEA: I'D LOVE TO BUT

10:16.616 --> 10:18.226
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
COURTNEY AT THE OFFICE

10:18.269 --> 10:20.620
TO REVIEW OUR
END USER DATABASE.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.405
WHICH, COME TO
THINK OF IT,

10:23.448 --> 10:25.799
IS THE PERFECT JOB

10:25.842 --> 10:28.628
FOR MY NEW CHIEF
OPERATING OFFICER.

10:28.671 --> 10:32.022
ME? CHIEF
OPERATING OFFICER?

10:32.066 --> 10:33.110
I'M ON IT.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.461
[SQUEALS] OK, SO,
WHAT'S THE NAME

10:36.505 --> 10:38.115
OF THIS TOUR COMPANY?

10:38.159 --> 10:41.205
HAS YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU
WHAT COMES AFTER?

10:41.249 --> 10:43.904
WHY HE WANTS TO RING
THE YUELING BELL?

10:45.949 --> 10:48.343
COME ON.
I ASSUME YOU'VE

10:48.386 --> 10:49.997
HEARD THE STORIES--

10:50.040 --> 10:51.781
THAT THE BELL CAN BE
USED TO ACCESS

10:51.825 --> 10:54.131
A REALM BEYOND OUR OWN,

10:54.175 --> 10:57.569
A REALM BETWEEN
LIFE AND DEATH.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.441
WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY

10:59.484 --> 11:01.573
HOPE TO PLUCK FROM
THIS OTHER WORLD?

11:03.271 --> 11:06.448
LOOK, EVEN I'LL ADMIT

11:06.491 --> 11:09.669
YOUR FATHER IS
AN IMPRESSIVE MAN.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.409
HE'S BUILT AN EMPIRE,

11:11.453 --> 11:14.325
A COMPANY WHOSE REACH
STRADDLES THE GLOBE.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.153
BUT HE'S NOT
YOUNG ANYMORE,

11:16.197 --> 11:19.200
AND IT'S TIME FOR HIM
TO CHOOSE A SUCCESSOR.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.899
AND I'M SURE THAT
HE'S MADE YOU PROMISES,

11:22.943 --> 11:24.771
IMPLIED THAT YOU'RE
HIS CHOSEN HEIR,

11:24.814 --> 11:26.511
BUT WHAT--WHAT IF THAT'S

11:26.555 --> 11:27.904
JUST HIS LATEST TRICK?

11:29.210 --> 11:31.821
WHAT IF HE'S BEEN
PLAYING YOU THIS WHOLE TIME,

11:31.865 --> 11:33.562
MANIPULATING YOU TO GET

11:33.605 --> 11:35.869
WHAT HE REALLY WANTS?

11:38.741 --> 11:42.136
RAYMOND. HIS FIRSTBORN SON.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.616
THE APPLE OF HIS EYE.
HIS GREATEST LOSS

11:44.660 --> 11:46.488
AND HIS GREATEST HEARTBREAK.

11:48.795 --> 11:53.234
HE'S TRYING
TO BRING HIM BACK.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.366
YOU NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.289
BAYSIDE TOUR COMPANY
RUNS 3 DAILY PATHS
OVER THE CITY,

12:05.333 --> 12:07.596
BUT THIS NORTH ONE
IS WAY OUTSIDE
THE RANGE I PINGED.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.207
THE CHOPPER SOUNDED LIKE
IT WAS RIGHT OVER MIA.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.557
THIS ONE'S A COASTAL TOUR,
SO, THAT'S OUT.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.255
THEN IT'S GOTTA BE
THIS ROUTE.

12:14.298 --> 12:17.737
WE CALLED MIA
AT 10:46 A.M.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.695
OK, SO, 10:30 DEPARTURE.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.828
10:46--SHOULD'VE
BEEN PASSING

12:21.871 --> 12:24.482
RIGHT OVER HERE,
THE AREA OF EXCELSIOR.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.615
WE SHOULD CHECK
REAL ESTATE LISTINGS
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD

12:26.658 --> 12:28.225
FOR ANYWHERE ZHILAN
COULD BE SQUATTING.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.140
HENRY: I'M ON IT.
NICKY: UM, LOOK FOR ANYTHING

12:30.184 --> 12:32.229
THAT'S BEEN
UNOCCUPIED FOR A WHILE.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.710
THERE'S A FEW CONDOS,
SOME EMPTY HOUSES,

12:34.754 --> 12:36.886
AND THERE'S A RUN-DOWN
CHURCH THAT'S BEEN

12:36.930 --> 12:38.409
ON THE MARKET
FOR A FEW YEARS.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.760
LET'S CHECK 'EM ALL OUT.
THANKS, ALTHEA.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.979
[SIGH] JULIETTE,

12:43.023 --> 12:45.721
YOU CAN'T EVEN WIN
AGAINST A CORPSE.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.331
THROW YOUR LOT
IN WITH US

12:47.375 --> 12:49.290
AND YOU'LL ACTUALLY
GET WHAT YOU DESERVE.

12:49.333 --> 12:52.510
SUPPOSE I DID.
HOW COULD I TRUST YOU?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.556
I PLAY ALONG,
YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT,

12:54.599 --> 12:56.210
AND THEN YOU'LL
KILL ME ANYWAY.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.994
YOU HAVE ME CONFUSED
WITH YOUR FATHER.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.214
HE'S THE DECEITFUL ONE.

13:00.257 --> 13:02.172
I HAVEN'T LIED
TO YOU ONCE.

13:02.216 --> 13:05.219
AS SOON AS WE GET
WHAT WE WANT,

13:05.262 --> 13:06.786
YOU'LL NEVER
SEE US AGAIN.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.232
MIA, WHAT IS IT?

13:18.275 --> 13:19.581
IT'S NICKY.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.932
SHE'S HERE.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.693
JULIETTE:
EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE?

13:49.045 --> 13:50.351
NICKY: WHERE ARE THEY?

13:52.005 --> 13:54.485
WE MISSED THEM.
THEY'RE GONE.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.843
YOU JUST MISSED THEM--

14:03.886 --> 14:05.496
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.894
HENRY: CAMERAS EVERYWHERE.
LOOKS LIKE A MONITOR STATION.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.766
THEY KNEW WE WERE COMING.
[DROPS OBJECT]

14:14.810 --> 14:16.159
NICKY: LOOK AROUND.
SEE IF THEY LEFT

14:16.203 --> 14:17.682
ANYTHING WE CAN USE
TO TRACK THEM.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.119
THEY TORTURED ME.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.555
HAD SOME HAREBRAINED IDEA

14:20.598 --> 14:22.252
I WOULD FLIP ON MY FATHER.

14:25.125 --> 14:28.693
WELL? YOU GONNA CUT ME LOOSE
OR WHAT?

14:30.957 --> 14:32.262
WHERE ARE THEY?

14:32.306 --> 14:34.786
SADLY, CAN'T HELP
YOU THERE.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.094
HOW WAS SHE?

14:40.227 --> 14:41.228
WHO?

14:41.271 --> 14:42.272
MIA.

14:42.316 --> 14:45.145
OH. LOVELY.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.930
SHE TRIED TO
CHOKE ME TO DEATH. SEE?

14:49.671 --> 14:52.674
OF ALL PEOPLE,
IT TOOK ZHILAN

14:52.717 --> 14:55.024
TO PULL HER BACK
FROM THE BRINK.

14:55.068 --> 14:59.594
I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
HER STRENGTH, HER RAGE--

14:59.637 --> 15:01.117
THAT GIRL IS A DEMON.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.729
YOUR COUSIN,
THE GIRL YOU'VE BEEN

15:04.773 --> 15:07.907
PROTECTING FOR MONTHS--
SHE'S UNHINGED.

15:10.692 --> 15:15.349
WELL? COME ON, NICKY.

15:15.392 --> 15:18.004
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO LEAVE ME HERE.

15:18.047 --> 15:22.965
WE'VE NEVER MET BUT
I'VE READ ALL ABOUT YOU

15:23.009 --> 15:27.274
AND I KNOW IT'S
JUST NOT WHO YOU ARE.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.281
FIND ANYTHING?

15:34.324 --> 15:35.369
NOT MUCH.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.638
[RIP]
JULIETTE: UHH.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.515
[RIP]

15:51.559 --> 15:52.864
[RIP]
UHH.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.656
THANK YOU.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.316
IF YOU'RE STILL
WORKING FOR YOUR FATHER

16:09.359 --> 16:11.883
WHEN WE TAKE HIM DOWN...

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
I'M MAKING SURE YOU
GO DOWN WITH HIM.

16:16.105 --> 16:17.280
YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.429
MIA: WHAT ARE WE DOING?
ZHILAN: SWITCHING CARS.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.039
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY WE RAN.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.476
WE GOT AS FAR AS
WE COULD WITH JULIETTE.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.956
I GOT IN HER HEAD,
AND THAT COULD

16:41.000 --> 16:43.219
SHAKE THINGS UP
ON THE TAN SIDE--

16:43.263 --> 16:45.526
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR US.

16:45.569 --> 16:48.790
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
WE REGROUP.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.706
BIDE OUR TIME.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.404
SO, MORE WAITING.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.624
YOU'LL GET YOUR VENGEANCE.
WE BOTH WILL.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.366
BUT WE HAVE TO BE
SMART ABOUT IT.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.674
HITTING TAN'S TOWN CAR
SENT HIM INTO LOCKDOWN.

17:03.718 --> 17:07.200
GREATER SECURITY,
MORE GUNS.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.289
[SPARK]
[ENGINE STARTS]

17:11.073 --> 17:13.162
REVENGE ISN'T
WORTH ANYTHING

17:13.206 --> 17:14.729
IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT ALIVE.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.036
I DON'T CARE
IF I GET OUT.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.385
I JUST WANT
TO GET IT DONE.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.126
MIA.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.257
LET'S GO.

17:22.954 --> 17:26.088
RUSSELL: MY GOD, JULIETTE.
LOOK AT YOU.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.134
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW WORRIED I WAS.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.049
I'M SO GLAD
WE FOUND YOU.

17:31.354 --> 17:32.834
THANK YOU, FATHER.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.575
BUT IT WASN'T YOU

17:34.618 --> 17:37.360
OR YOUR MEN
WHO FOUND ME.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.709
IT WAS NICKY SHEN.

17:38.753 --> 17:42.800
YES. MY MEN FAILED YOU.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.238
GOES WITHOUT SAYING
I DIDN'T MAKE IT

17:45.281 --> 17:46.935
TO MY MEETING
WITH PASCAL.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.242
IT'S FINE.
I SPOKE WITH HIM.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.679
THE ZINDLE DEAL
IS SECURE.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.986
JULIETTE: WELL--
RUSSELL: ALL THAT REMAINS

17:55.030 --> 17:56.466
IS FOR US TO FIND MIA.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.773
AND BEZ AND I
ARE WORKING ON IT.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.603
AND AFTER?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.648
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME
THE LAST STEP.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.128
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
THE EARTHQUAKE,

18:06.172 --> 18:08.261
WHAT EXACTLY
MY ROLE IS.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.392
I NEED TO KNOW.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.915
JULIETTE, YOU WILL KNOW

18:10.959 --> 18:12.395
EVERYTHING SOON ENOUGH.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.180
GET SOME REST.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.660
YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.184
YES, FATHER.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.541
ONE CHORIZO BURRITO,
CHRISTMAS STYLE,

18:27.584 --> 18:29.804
EXTRA WET,
JUST HOW YOU LIKE IT.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.719
THANKS. NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.156
I DROVE ALL THE WAY
TO MISSION FOR THIS.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.245
AND YOU HAVEN'T EATEN
IN TWO WHOLE HOURS.

18:36.289 --> 18:39.335
RYAN: I DON'T WANT FOOD.
ALTHEA: NUH-UH-UH.
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.902
I JUST WANT TO HELP.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.773
DO RESEARCH. SOMETHING.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.646
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
SO CHAOTIC LATELY.

18:45.689 --> 18:48.257
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE
HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.432
THERE'S STILL SO MUCH
WE DON'T KNOW

18:49.476 --> 18:50.477
ABOUT WHAT TAN IS UP TO.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.782
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT

18:51.826 --> 18:52.957
FOR YOU TO JUST RELAX...

18:53.001 --> 18:54.524
BECAUSE IT'S MY FAULT!

18:57.266 --> 18:59.529
RYAN.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.270
IT WAS MY JOB
TO WATCH HER

19:01.314 --> 19:02.576
AND I LET HER GET AWAY.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.187
IF YOU HAD SEEN
HER FACE, ALTHEA,

19:05.231 --> 19:07.537
SHE WAS SO SCARED.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.235
I JUST--I CAN'T BE

19:09.278 --> 19:12.542
STUCK HERE RIGHT NOW
DOING NOTHING.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.805
ALL I ASK IS FOR YOU
TO GO TO THE CLINIC

19:14.849 --> 19:18.026
AND BRING ME MY
JYU SA RESEARCH. PLEASE.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.202
ALTHEA: OK. WHERE IS IT?
RYAN: BOTTOM DRAWER OF MY DESK.

19:20.246 --> 19:23.684
UCCH. YOU GOT ME RUNNING
ALL OVER TOWN FOR YOU.

19:23.727 --> 19:26.339
AND YOU BETTER NOT
MOVE FROM THIS COUCH
WHILE I'M GONE.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.819
YOU'RE FAR AND AWAY
MY FAVORITE SISTER.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.604
I'M TELLING NICKY
YOU SAID THAT.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.175
[DOOR CLOSES]NOT REALLY HUNGRY.
GOOD ONE, RYAN.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.982
WELL, FATHER--
MY BIRTHDAY?

20:03.811 --> 20:06.466
DEFINITELY NOT KERWIN'S.

20:06.509 --> 20:07.554
MUST BE...

20:11.035 --> 20:13.690
RAYMOND. OF COURSE.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.232
"THE LOST JOURNAL
OF THE ALCHEMIST."

20:42.632 --> 20:44.417
"PROPERTIES OF JYU SA."

20:54.383 --> 20:55.471
"RESURRECTION."

21:01.564 --> 21:04.915
"A PARENT'S GRIEF--A SACRIFICE.

21:06.177 --> 21:09.833
THE PARENT AND CHILD
WILL CONQUER DEATH."

21:18.668 --> 21:20.279
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE MIA IS.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.932
THIS IS ALL WE FOUND
AT ZHILAN'S SAFEHOUSE.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.586
SHE HAD SEVERAL
OF THESE CAMERAS

21:23.630 --> 21:25.545
SET UP OUTSIDE THE
PERIMETER OF HER HIDEOUT.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.332
I RECOGNIZE THIS.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.681
WHEN I WAS
STAKING TAN OUT,

21:31.725 --> 21:33.248
HIS OFFICES,
HIS WAREHOUSES,

21:33.292 --> 21:34.641
I FOUND THIS
EXACT SAME MODEL OF CAMERA

21:34.684 --> 21:36.251
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM ALL OF THEM.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.166
I ASSUMED THEY BELONGED
TO TAN, BUT--

21:38.209 --> 21:39.385
THEY WERE ZHILAN'S.

21:39.428 --> 21:41.517
SHE'S BEEN
WATCHING HIM.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.780
WE COULD USE THIS TO
GET INTO ZHILAN'S CLOUD.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.652
THEN WE'D HAVE ACCESS
TO ALL OF HER CAMERAS.

21:47.131 --> 21:48.524
THAT'S HOW WE
TRACK THEM.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.483
WE CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.833
IF ZHILAN STILL HAS EYES
ON THESE FEEDS,

21:52.876 --> 21:55.488
WE COULD SET UP A TRAP--
LURE HER AND MIA THERE.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.098
EVAN: WHAT'S THE BAIT?
NICKY: WE KNOW THEY'RE DESPERATE

21:57.141 --> 21:59.143
TO KILL RUSSELL TAN.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.493
LET'S GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.768
HELLO, BROTHER.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.557
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

22:21.601 --> 22:22.950
DID FATHER SEND YOU?

22:25.996 --> 22:27.824
YOU WERE RIGHT, KERWIN.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.741
HIS GAME--
IT WAS ALWAYS

22:31.785 --> 22:33.743
RIGGED AGAINST US.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.052
JULIETTE, WHAT HAPPENED?

22:38.095 --> 22:39.183
IT'S NOTHING.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.230
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:42.273 --> 22:44.319
I WANT TO DESTROY
OUR FATHER.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.714
