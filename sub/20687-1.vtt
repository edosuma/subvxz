01:16.247 --> 01:17.580
Hey.

01:17.602 --> 01:18.807
Shhh...

01:29.872 --> 01:32.663
Get ready. The storm will be over soon.

01:34.497 --> 01:38.497
I don't feel good about this.
It's a lousy plan.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.122
Okay, grab it.

01:50.913 --> 01:53.247
- What's the matter with him?
- He's nervous.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.288
Shh. Hey.

01:55.372 --> 01:57.247
Hey, easy.

01:57.330 --> 01:59.455
Whoa. Hey.

01:59.538 --> 02:00.788
Easy.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.955
- Yeah!
- I'm all right!

02:12.622 --> 02:15.455
Told you. We're not big enough.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.497
Hang on.

02:28.247 --> 02:31.330
- We did it.
- Yeah, 46th time's the charm.

02:31.413 --> 02:34.372
Can't you just enjoy it for once?

02:41.330 --> 02:44.747
Oh, so sweet of you.

02:46.997 --> 02:49.538
There's two ways
we can handle this situation:

02:49.622 --> 02:52.788
The cool one, or the uncool one.

02:52.872 --> 02:56.038
Uh, c-c-cool way's good, right, ajar?

02:56.122 --> 02:58.622
- Don't come any closer.
- Or what?

02:58.705 --> 03:00.580
Don't answer that. It's a trick question.

03:00.663 --> 03:03.163
Baby skin, baby sting.

03:04.955 --> 03:07.372
Oh, not again.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.288
I hate when this happens.

03:09.372 --> 03:12.372
You guys really suit each other.

03:12.455 --> 03:15.122
The big, bad bedwetters.

03:16.122 --> 03:19.913
If you want this watermelon,
it'll be over my dead body.

03:19.997 --> 03:21.330
Okay.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.288
And stay down!

03:57.122 --> 03:59.163
George, why are you...?

03:59.247 --> 04:01.538
- Go away!
- Hey!

04:01.622 --> 04:04.205
- Move it!
- I was here first!

04:04.288 --> 04:07.538
- So, girls, who's the man?
- Hide!

04:07.622 --> 04:10.122
Come and get it. Any time, ladies.

04:20.247 --> 04:21.288
All right, come on.

04:21.372 --> 04:25.455
Come on. Kiddies, lighten up.
I brought some for everyone.

04:25.538 --> 04:29.580
You're wimpy bedwetters
but we still like you.

04:29.663 --> 04:34.747
Hey, guys, give our good friends here
ajar and pitt their share.

04:37.705 --> 04:38.830
Oh, no.

04:51.622 --> 04:54.747
Leave them alone.
They're so little and cute.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.038
I'm not little!

04:58.913 --> 05:01.163
And we're not cute!

05:07.413 --> 05:09.997
- Could have been worse.
- Oh, yeah? How?

05:10.080 --> 05:11.997
They didn't beat us up this time.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.955
I can't stand this anymore. I'm leaving.

05:15.038 --> 05:17.163
Oh, yeah? Where are you gonna go?

05:23.622 --> 05:24.997
You're kidding, right?

05:25.080 --> 05:28.038
Oh, he's not kidding. Oh, boy.

05:28.122 --> 05:31.288
Should I remind you
what happened to those who tried?

05:31.372 --> 05:36.497
Or maybe bring you their skulls?
Green snakes, us, okay?

05:36.580 --> 05:39.747
- We don't belong over there.
- We don't belong over here either.

05:39.830 --> 05:41.413
Come on, we're losers.

05:41.497 --> 05:44.413
No, no. Losers make fun of us.

05:45.455 --> 05:49.080
- We don't have anyone but each other.
- No, no, don't do that.

05:49.163 --> 05:52.997
- Wait. What is that?
- What?

06:08.663 --> 06:11.538
Let me go!

06:11.622 --> 06:14.663
You're hurting me! Let me go!

06:14.747 --> 06:18.413
- Wow.
- Huh? You see? You see?

06:18.497 --> 06:21.372
You can't get in
and you can't even get out.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.622
Hey, you saw that, right?

06:24.705 --> 06:26.455
You got that?

06:26.538 --> 06:30.080
- Hello?
- Did you see that girl?

06:30.163 --> 06:33.830
- We can't not go in there.
- Oh, boy.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.997
<i>♪ She was afraid
to come out of the locker ♪</i>

06:41.080 --> 06:44.038
<i>♪ she was as nervous
as she could be ♪</i>

06:44.122 --> 06:46.205
You're hurting me!

06:50.705 --> 06:51.955
Put me down!

06:52.038 --> 06:55.705
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but she was heading towards the desert.

06:55.788 --> 06:58.080
- Well, thank you, chief chief.
- No big deal.

06:58.163 --> 07:03.122
This pretty green in the sand,
i can spot it from miles away.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.622
Hey, don't you have an oasis to watch?

07:05.705 --> 07:08.538
Yes, sir. I'll leave you with your family.

07:08.622 --> 07:11.122
And sorry for the inconvenience.

07:13.372 --> 07:17.247
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's dangerous over there.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.913
What do you expect to find anyway?

07:19.997 --> 07:23.580
What are you gonna do
if you come across a dustie, huh?

07:23.663 --> 07:26.705
- Oh, yeah, yeah, go ahead, play deaf.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:26.788 --> 07:28.705
Do you know
what those ugly snakes are like?

07:28.788 --> 07:33.038
Beggars, thieves, liars!
They don't even wash, for Pete's sake!

07:33.122 --> 07:35.663
No water. Hello?

07:35.747 --> 07:39.497
I'm pretty sure they eat their own poop
and marry their children.

07:39.580 --> 07:43.080
- Or maybe it's the other way around.
- Are you actually saying that?

07:43.163 --> 07:46.955
Are you even aware of how lucky you are
to have been born here?

07:47.038 --> 07:48.330
You've got everything.

07:48.413 --> 07:51.205
- Security, a future.
- What future?

07:51.288 --> 07:54.247
Sit around a stone all day
playing dead like you?

07:54.330 --> 07:57.830
Okay, that's enough, young lady.
We're having the Spencers over for dinner.

07:57.913 --> 08:01.580
You know, the ones
with the big south-facing stone.

08:01.663 --> 08:04.205
I can't even imagine
what they paid for it.

08:04.288 --> 08:06.913
Anyway, they're coming
with their son John-John.

08:06.997 --> 08:09.372
- A really nice chap.
- What do you think?

08:09.455 --> 08:11.872
That you can sell me
like it's the middle ages?

08:11.955 --> 08:13.622
That's disgusting!

08:13.705 --> 08:16.413
I can't stand this place anymore!
I feel sick!

08:16.497 --> 08:18.205
I'm suffocating here!

08:18.288 --> 08:20.622
Mm.

08:21.580 --> 08:24.330
Oh, my god, you're crying.

08:24.413 --> 08:26.372
What happened?
Did you mess up your makeup?

08:26.455 --> 08:28.788
Hey! No touchy.

08:30.872 --> 08:32.996
Ah, teenagers.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.663
So annoying, right?

08:36.788 --> 08:41.496
- Okay. See you later, guys.
- Oh, uh, you're going out again?

08:41.580 --> 08:45.538
- Yeah. The guys are waiting for me.
- And, uh, what are you gonna do?

08:45.622 --> 08:46.747
Hm.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.122
The usual: Nothing.

08:49.205 --> 08:52.580
Gary, won't you at least take off the wig?
I mean, really, it's been a...

08:52.663 --> 08:55.663
Yeah, yeah.
Love you, too, dad. See ya.

08:56.705 --> 08:59.455
How did we end up with those kids?

08:59.538 --> 09:00.913
Hmm?

09:01.872 --> 09:05.122
Would you be a sweetheart
and go get me a nice pillow?

09:31.455 --> 09:32.913
Huh?

09:34.455 --> 09:35.788
Hm.

09:42.122 --> 09:43.122
Ha ha!

09:43.205 --> 09:44.622
Have you lost your mind?

09:44.705 --> 09:47.413
Well, the oasis belongs
to the green snakes, right?

09:47.497 --> 09:49.913
I'm not planning on dying with you,
you know?

09:49.997 --> 09:52.538
- You don't have to come with me.
- And you're not gonna make me.

09:52.622 --> 09:55.455
No one is ever gonna make me!

09:56.997 --> 10:00.038
All right, come on, wait for me!
Let's go die together!

10:01.247 --> 10:03.413
Just a little reminder for later,

10:03.497 --> 10:06.497
this is when it all started
to go down in flames.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.205
Right this second.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.080
Hide.

10:12.163 --> 10:13.788
- What?
- Hide!

10:18.788 --> 10:20.705
You're not in a secure zone, sir.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.455
- Are you lost?
- Uh, no.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.330
No. Well, yes, actually. I don't know.

10:25.413 --> 10:29.038
It's extremely dangerous around here, sir.
You're at the border.

10:29.122 --> 10:30.997
I'm afraid you can't stay here.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.247
Dusties, they're not kidding, you know?

10:33.330 --> 10:35.497
- Of course, yeah. I didn't know.
- Wha...?

10:35.580 --> 10:39.497
You put yourself in peril,
you're putting me in peril.

10:39.580 --> 10:43.205
You wouldn't want to put me in peril now,
would you? Hm?

10:43.288 --> 10:45.663
No, no. Not at all. Absolutely.

10:45.747 --> 10:51.330
All right, so you're gonna go slither
a little more over that way, please.

10:52.830 --> 10:54.872
Thank you, officer.

10:58.663 --> 10:59.955
Come on.

11:34.830 --> 11:35.913
Wow!

11:52.038 --> 11:53.497
Dusties! Alert!

11:53.580 --> 11:55.747
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

11:55.830 --> 11:58.622
Stop running around.
You're gonna get us noticed.

11:58.705 --> 12:01.205
Stop! We're not the ones they're after.

12:03.663 --> 12:04.663
Pitt!

12:20.872 --> 12:21.872
Pitt, you there?

12:25.122 --> 12:26.622
Pitt?

12:28.455 --> 12:30.247
Please don't say anything.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.538
You... you're a dustie?

12:32.622 --> 12:36.163
Really? I mean, yeah, of course, I am.

12:36.247 --> 12:37.830
But I've never seen you...

12:37.913 --> 12:41.955
I mean, of course I haven't,
obviously, because I live here.

12:42.038 --> 12:45.538
I've never been over there,
where you live.

12:46.372 --> 12:47.997
Are you new here?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.913
- How did you know?
- I don't.

12:53.663 --> 12:56.122
I gotta get out of here.
They're gonna kill me!

12:56.205 --> 12:58.705
Out? Which way? I don't even know...

12:59.247 --> 13:02.580
I mean, sure, I know, but I...

13:04.247 --> 13:05.622
Watch out!

13:17.830 --> 13:20.997
Next time, watch where you're going,
you big lump!

13:21.080 --> 13:23.663
Ajar? Ajar?

13:57.622 --> 13:59.288
Step aside, sir.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.663
Don't worry, everything's under control.

14:03.747 --> 14:07.413
- I'm Eva.
- I, uh... ajar.

14:07.497 --> 14:09.663
Okay, ajar. Follow me!

14:09.747 --> 14:11.830
Hm?

14:15.997 --> 14:17.872
Ooh. Ouch!

14:31.247 --> 14:34.413
You can't swim? How come you can't swim?

14:34.497 --> 14:36.247
How come you can swim?

14:43.038 --> 14:44.080
Ajar!

14:47.247 --> 14:48.247
Look out!

15:48.288 --> 15:51.205
What were you doing in the oasis?

15:51.288 --> 15:54.872
You're a dustie.
That's why you can't swim.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.538
Did you wanna steal something
or kill someone?

15:57.622 --> 15:59.497
- You're not gonna kill me, right?
- Hey, stop.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.372
Calm down. I'm not gonna hurt you.

16:02.455 --> 16:03.372
I...

16:03.455 --> 16:06.205
I just...
I just wanted to come and live here.

16:06.288 --> 16:09.205
The oasis? It's like the worst place ever.

16:09.288 --> 16:10.747
It's ridiculously small,

16:10.830 --> 16:12.473
you just keep seeing
the same boring people

16:12.497 --> 16:14.955
who are only worried
about protecting their things.

16:15.038 --> 16:18.288
It's... it's like being in jail.

16:18.372 --> 16:20.663
Look, I'm not going back there.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.455
I'd like to go further, you know,
find out what's beyond these rocks.

16:26.247 --> 16:29.830
I can't believe
I'm actually talking to a dustie.

16:29.913 --> 16:32.913
I thought you'd be more impressive
or something.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.413
Don't need any help here!

16:39.455 --> 16:42.205
- Is it true you eat your own poop?
- What? No way!

16:42.288 --> 16:44.997
I mean, unless we're...

16:45.080 --> 16:49.663
- So, who's the girl?
- Eva. Nice to meet you.

17:00.830 --> 17:03.747
No trace of them, chief chief.
They probably drowned.

17:03.830 --> 17:08.079
Okay. Go back to the station.
I'll take a last look around.

17:13.038 --> 17:14.288
They lost us.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.288
- Are you coming?
- Hm?

17:20.204 --> 17:22.829
You... you want me to come with you?

17:24.872 --> 17:26.872
Are you afraid of freedom?

17:27.788 --> 17:29.163
Eva!

17:31.747 --> 17:33.913
Mm.

17:33.997 --> 17:35.122
Ahh!

17:35.205 --> 17:36.455
No!

17:42.580 --> 17:45.913
- Ajar, don't!
- Ajar! Help me!

17:46.830 --> 17:49.538
I'm coming, Eva! I'm coming!

17:50.872 --> 17:51.872
Ajar!

18:10.038 --> 18:11.372
No!

18:21.038 --> 18:24.038
All right.
I believe you know why you're here.

18:24.122 --> 18:27.830
- Because you're jerks?
- We'll do the talking.

18:27.913 --> 18:30.497
You're here because you shouldn't be here.

18:32.163 --> 18:35.413
And why shouldn't you be here?

18:36.413 --> 18:39.080
- 'Cause we're dusties.
- Exactly.

18:39.163 --> 18:43.622
Now you seem like you're a nice kid,
but we have a problem.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.997
- You got in illegally.
- It was a mistake.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.622
We won't do it again, ever. Right, ajar?

18:50.705 --> 18:52.413
We can't let you go.

18:52.497 --> 18:55.830
We let one go, then everyone else thinks
they got a shot.

18:55.913 --> 18:57.955
You understand this, don't you?

18:59.330 --> 19:02.247
If anything happens to her,
i swear, I'll-I'll...

19:02.330 --> 19:03.455
Kill them.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.497
Pitt!

19:07.580 --> 19:10.038
We don't really like your kind
around here.

19:10.122 --> 19:11.413
Let me go!

19:12.663 --> 19:15.830
- Ajar!
- You were saying?

19:19.413 --> 19:21.038
Let him go!

19:21.122 --> 19:24.163
- Hey, could you turn it down a notch?
- Put me down!

19:24.247 --> 19:28.455
My head is literally ringing over here.
Thanks.

19:28.538 --> 19:31.080
You should go easy on the pollen, sir.

19:31.163 --> 19:34.497
Now please go sit over there and
I'll talk to your dad in a minute.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.788
What? No.

19:35.872 --> 19:38.955
Hey, I didn't take any pollen, sir.
No way.

19:39.038 --> 19:41.205
I mean, you know me. Come on.

19:42.205 --> 19:44.122
Go back to the tank, please, sir.

19:44.205 --> 19:46.045
You don't want to see
what's gonna happen here.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.122
Yeah, well, don't go blabbing
about pollen around my dad, okay?

19:50.205 --> 19:53.872
I think it's better if we kept it secret.

19:58.372 --> 20:00.580
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

20:00.663 --> 20:03.580
I think he said, "let's order pizza."

20:03.663 --> 20:05.538
Let us go or I'll kill him.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.830
Huh?

20:06.913 --> 20:11.497
- Oh, yeah. That makes more sense.
- Don't try anything.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.247
- Sergeant, don't move.
- There. Yeah, you see? Listen to him.

20:15.413 --> 20:18.622
Hey, you're not really my style, bro.

20:18.705 --> 20:19.872
Hm?

20:21.663 --> 20:24.497
Pitt, get on his back.

20:26.830 --> 20:29.788
Now if you follow us, he's dead meat.
You got that?

20:29.872 --> 20:32.622
You do what you're told or he's dead. Go!

20:34.913 --> 20:36.038
Now go up!

20:37.080 --> 20:38.872
No, no, higher, higher.

20:38.955 --> 20:40.497
Yeah. Go!

20:40.580 --> 20:43.372
- What do we do, chief chief?
- Catch them.

20:43.455 --> 20:46.955
And bring that freak back alive.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.663
The sergeant?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.455
No, the worm with the rug.

20:51.538 --> 20:54.580
- Oh!
- Keep flying.

20:54.663 --> 20:56.247
They're after us!

20:57.247 --> 20:58.747
Keep going. Keep going.

21:00.122 --> 21:03.788
- Pitt, throw something at 'em!
- What do you want me to throw?

21:05.913 --> 21:08.372
Hey, my wig! Are you crazy?

21:11.122 --> 21:15.288
It's the symbol of my individuality
and my belief in personal freedom.

21:22.455 --> 21:24.788
Ajar, flip the bird!

21:29.747 --> 21:30.747
Hang on!

21:31.788 --> 21:33.497
Whoa!

21:41.997 --> 21:45.705
Whoa, you sure showed them.

21:45.788 --> 21:48.538
Hey, just drop me off over there
by the palm tree.

21:48.622 --> 21:50.288
No way. We gotta save Eva.

21:50.372 --> 21:52.247
- Huh?
- I beg your pardon?

21:52.330 --> 21:55.747
Eva? Like, my sister? What?

21:55.830 --> 21:57.038
We're her only hope.

21:57.122 --> 21:58.413
You don't even know her!

21:58.497 --> 22:02.872
If you guys are, like, talking about
my sister, let it go, seriously.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.497
Did you hear that?
She's this guy's sister!

22:06.580 --> 22:09.705
There, another palm tree,
that'll be fine.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.056
Ajar, we never do anything right.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.247
She'd probably have a better chance
without us.

22:14.872 --> 22:18.747
I hate doing this,
but do you have any idea who my father is?

22:18.830 --> 22:22.372
- No.
- Really? You don't know?

22:22.455 --> 22:26.247
What if I tell you he's the richest,
most powerful snake in the oasis?

22:26.330 --> 22:29.163
What if I told you I don't care?

22:29.247 --> 22:34.038
I'm hesitating between
you're either super brave or totally dumb.

22:35.747 --> 22:37.538
We're toast!

23:04.497 --> 23:07.913
All right, people.
Everyone in place now.

23:07.997 --> 23:10.788
Kick it up a notch. No pain, no gain.

23:10.872 --> 23:16.455
And bend and snap, and bend and snap.
And suck it in, big girl.

23:16.538 --> 23:19.122
- Hey, the new girl's up.
- Hm?

23:19.205 --> 23:21.413
Welcome! We're so happy to meet you.

23:21.497 --> 23:23.497
- I'm Lily belle.
- I'm Lulu belle.

23:23.580 --> 23:25.139
- We're twin sisters.
- We're twin sisters.

23:25.163 --> 23:27.330
- We're both geminis.
- We're both geminis.

23:28.788 --> 23:32.413
Hmm, you've got potential, girl.

23:32.497 --> 23:34.497
I feel like you're a bit
on the chubby side.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.997
Better get into some pilates for a while.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.788
I'm sorry, what?

23:38.872 --> 23:43.705
You think that just anybody
can get into miss Rita's ballet company?

23:43.788 --> 23:48.122
- Oh, so it's "miss Rita's ballet company".
- Precisely.

23:48.205 --> 23:52.413
Who made dancers out of you?
Who taught you everything?

23:52.497 --> 23:53.538
Him?

23:53.622 --> 23:56.330
Him is the he-who-must-not-be-named.

23:56.413 --> 23:59.038
- Yeah, you can't say "Omar" or...
- You just said it.

23:59.122 --> 24:01.788
- What did just I say?
- You said what we're not supposed to say.

24:01.872 --> 24:03.913
- You said, "Omar."
- You just said it!

24:03.997 --> 24:07.455
- What? I didn't say Omar. You said Omar.
- You just said it again!

24:07.538 --> 24:10.747
I'm pietra.
The company has one prima ballerina.

24:10.830 --> 24:12.997
- You just said it again.
- Me.

24:13.080 --> 24:16.705
Keep that in mind
and everything will be just fine.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.788
No, everything will not be just fine.

24:18.872 --> 24:21.247
It's a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

24:21.330 --> 24:24.663
I was just slithering by and I...
I can't even dance!

24:31.080 --> 24:34.663
Hello. Everything is going to be fine.

24:34.747 --> 24:36.163
George is here.

24:36.247 --> 24:38.122
- Who?
- George.

24:38.205 --> 24:41.580
The George. Me.

24:41.663 --> 24:45.622
Is this your first tour?
Don't answer. It's obvious.

24:45.705 --> 24:47.913
So fresh, so pure.

24:49.997 --> 24:51.913
She's adorable.

24:51.997 --> 24:55.205
I see great things for you, for us.

24:55.288 --> 24:57.830
Do you...
Feel it?

24:57.913 --> 24:59.788
That chemistry between us?

24:59.872 --> 25:02.288
Oh, what is happening to us?

25:02.372 --> 25:06.038
A wild one. I love it.

25:06.955 --> 25:07.788
Huh.

25:07.872 --> 25:10.122
Oh, chill out, I was just kidding.

25:10.205 --> 25:12.538
Girls, really.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.580
Don't worry, you're not that fat.

25:17.663 --> 25:19.080
Check this out.

25:19.163 --> 25:21.830
When you get hungry, you do this and poof!

25:21.913 --> 25:25.497
- You're not hungry anymore.
- You're one of us now.

25:25.580 --> 25:27.622
One of us! One of us!

25:27.705 --> 25:31.163
One of us! One of us! One of us!

25:34.663 --> 25:37.163
You guys see this?

25:37.247 --> 25:39.122
- It's...
- High.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.538
Flat.

25:41.538 --> 25:43.330
It's beautiful.

25:44.622 --> 25:47.872
This is a once in a lifetime experience.

25:47.955 --> 25:50.288
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

25:50.372 --> 25:52.705
Wow, funny skin.

25:52.788 --> 25:55.622
- It's a dustie skin.
- Oh, yeah?

25:55.705 --> 25:57.913
- It looks more like you haven't...
- There!

25:59.622 --> 26:01.622
That way!

26:04.872 --> 26:05.997
Pitt!

26:06.080 --> 26:10.247
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not gonna let you murder us!

26:17.955 --> 26:19.663
Pitt!

26:26.122 --> 26:28.122
Oh, great.

26:28.913 --> 26:31.205
What's with him?

26:31.288 --> 26:32.872
- He's asleep.
- Oops.

26:32.955 --> 26:35.538
Now? Really?

26:35.622 --> 26:38.247
Sorry, my bad.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.997
No, no!

27:04.538 --> 27:08.080
Okay, definitely not super brave.

27:08.163 --> 27:10.913
Super crazy.

27:10.997 --> 27:14.080
- You almost got us killed!
- I said I was sorry!

27:14.163 --> 27:15.747
How are we ever gonna find Eva now?

27:15.830 --> 27:17.830
Dude, let it go already.

27:17.913 --> 27:20.038
- The girl's off limits anyway.
- Oh, yeah?

27:20.122 --> 27:21.705
- Why'd she kiss me?
- I don't know.

27:21.788 --> 27:24.997
You were the exotic tourist.
The kind you forget right away.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.622
Okay. I'm kinda bored right now.

27:27.705 --> 27:29.705
You don't need a hostage anymore,

27:29.788 --> 27:32.372
and my sister's obviously safe
with you two.

27:32.455 --> 27:33.622
I'm gonna leave now, okay?

27:33.705 --> 27:36.788
Yeah, okay, bye.
We have places we need to go.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.455
Come on, up.

27:47.622 --> 27:48.997
Up.

27:50.705 --> 27:52.830
Dustie, dead ahead.

27:54.372 --> 27:55.497
Lunch break.

27:56.872 --> 28:00.038
You're here
because you shouldn't be here.

28:00.122 --> 28:02.955
Great. Just great.

28:06.205 --> 28:09.247
Hey, geniuses!

28:09.330 --> 28:11.788
Batman? Robin?

28:13.080 --> 28:17.497
Okay, so who's Batman?
And who does Robin?

28:17.580 --> 28:18.788
I'm Gary.

28:21.455 --> 28:25.205
So you guys are, like, buddies?
That's weird.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.497
A snake and a scorpion?

28:27.580 --> 28:30.413
I mean, I say that
but nothing ever really shocks me.

28:30.497 --> 28:32.788
My friend Peter once dated a frog, so...

28:32.872 --> 28:34.497
Does he ever shut up?

28:34.580 --> 28:35.889
the desert is super dangerous?

28:35.913 --> 28:40.205
They even blow things up out there,
just for the fun of it.

28:43.413 --> 28:47.497
You should save some saliva, you know?
Desert and all.

28:47.580 --> 28:49.372
Okay, do I need to remind you two

28:49.455 --> 28:52.163
that if you had dropped me off
like I told you to, we...

28:52.247 --> 28:53.455
Shut up!

28:57.705 --> 29:01.330
Ever hear of non-aggressive
verbal communication?

29:03.538 --> 29:07.080
Guess not. Okay, I'll shut up.

29:13.163 --> 29:14.997
Are you sure this is the right way?

29:15.080 --> 29:18.580
I can't really imagine a whole camelcade
going through here.

29:18.663 --> 29:20.997
Exactly. They have to go around it.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.288
But we can go through it
and beat them to the other side.

29:24.372 --> 29:27.788
I know! We can do like tuaregs
and follow that bright star.

29:27.872 --> 29:30.038
What about that cluster over there? See?

29:30.122 --> 29:32.622
The one that looks like
a weird-shaped goat.

29:32.705 --> 29:35.705
I see two weird goats down here.

29:35.788 --> 29:40.788
I mean, seriously, you guys don't
even know how to get out of a maze?

29:40.872 --> 29:43.080
Everyone knows how to do that.

29:43.163 --> 29:46.747
All you have to do
is keep going in the same direction.

29:46.830 --> 29:47.830
Left.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.663
Left.

29:53.038 --> 29:55.122
Left.

29:55.205 --> 29:57.330
Left again.

29:57.413 --> 29:58.830
And...

29:58.913 --> 30:00.913
Uh. Mm?

30:00.997 --> 30:03.413
Okay, so, goat.

30:03.497 --> 30:06.205
Wait. It wasn't the right left.

30:07.872 --> 30:08.997
Left.

30:10.163 --> 30:11.705
Left.

30:12.913 --> 30:14.163
Again?

30:16.497 --> 30:17.830
Left.

30:23.913 --> 30:27.580
Hey, leftie, you all right in there?
Hey!

30:29.288 --> 30:32.663
Gary, where are you?

30:32.747 --> 30:36.622
- Say something!
- Here!

30:40.080 --> 30:42.205
Gary?

30:42.288 --> 30:44.830
Gary, where are you?

30:49.830 --> 30:51.830
Fantastic.

30:51.913 --> 30:54.163
How are you ever gonna get me
out of here now?

30:54.247 --> 30:55.913
Why didn't you warn us?

30:55.997 --> 30:59.538
Hey, you're the rescuers here, I believe.

31:01.247 --> 31:04.413
Okay. So now what?

31:08.038 --> 31:11.288
Well, we only have one choice.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.497
don't forget the grand finale.

31:16.580 --> 31:21.163
Flower, seahorse, flower, butterfly.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.372
So...

31:23.455 --> 31:26.955
- Oh, I love your voice.
- Okay, enough babbling. It's time.

31:27.038 --> 31:29.497
Time? Time for what?

31:30.830 --> 31:33.288
Huh?

31:37.747 --> 31:40.497
I can't tell you to break a leg, right?

31:47.372 --> 31:51.122
Come here now. Watch and learn.

31:51.205 --> 31:53.997
Okay, um... just a sec.

31:58.455 --> 31:59.997
Snakes.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.247
Lords of the desert for millennia,

32:03.330 --> 32:05.788
sons of the sun.

32:05.872 --> 32:07.247
Beautiful for some,

32:08.288 --> 32:11.038
terrifying for others.

32:16.538 --> 32:21.372
But there lies a power
that masters their souls.

32:21.455 --> 32:26.288
Carved in the vertebra of a seba python,
by a voodoo master from Benin

32:26.372 --> 32:30.122
- thousands of years ago.
- Uh-uh.

32:30.205 --> 32:31.497
Dad!

32:31.580 --> 32:35.330
The flute of kpassenou.

33:01.788 --> 33:04.497
You, stop! Freeze!

33:04.580 --> 33:07.747
Do you want to end up as a belt?
Get down, now!

35:26.580 --> 35:28.580
Wow, was that your first time?

35:28.663 --> 35:30.622
Your very first time.

35:30.705 --> 35:33.705
- Oh, your voice is just so beautiful.
- Yours is.

35:33.788 --> 35:35.330
- Oh, my goodness.
- That was terrible.

35:35.413 --> 35:38.247
Dance is not just undulating around.

35:38.330 --> 35:42.705
Everyone, lights out! And you, watch it!

35:49.372 --> 35:53.997
What just happened there?
It was... it was stronger than me.

35:54.080 --> 35:58.163
That music, I couldn't fight it.

35:58.247 --> 36:00.872
And you even loved it, didn't you?

36:02.747 --> 36:06.955
You're done, girl,
just like the rest of us.

36:18.122 --> 36:22.205
I don't know about you
but I'd love a little break,

36:22.288 --> 36:24.413
like, a pollen break.

36:24.497 --> 36:25.788
Do you guys have some?

36:28.580 --> 36:29.580
Really?

36:30.663 --> 36:34.538
Come on. I'm sure it's pollen land
where you're from.

36:34.622 --> 36:36.163
You know I'm right.

36:36.830 --> 36:37.663
Oh!

36:37.747 --> 36:39.622
Awkward contact. No touchy.

36:39.705 --> 36:40.913
Shh!

36:47.788 --> 36:48.955
Hm?

36:53.997 --> 36:55.413
Hm?

37:01.080 --> 37:02.330
Wow!

37:04.330 --> 37:07.288
<i>♪ Light
we are light ♪</i>

37:07.372 --> 37:11.705
<i>♪ you are light
we are all light ♪</i>

37:11.788 --> 37:13.913
Great. Bugs.

37:13.997 --> 37:17.705
Welcome, strangers.
May the light be with you.

37:17.788 --> 37:19.788
How may we enlighten you?

37:19.872 --> 37:22.372
Well, we're trying to reach the west end.

37:22.455 --> 37:26.413
The west end, we're frickin' lost.

37:26.497 --> 37:29.413
Would you happen to have seen
a camelcade around here?

37:29.497 --> 37:32.413
The camelcade path, very simple.

37:32.497 --> 37:35.955
All you need to do
is follow the pole star.

37:36.955 --> 37:40.288
These guys were following a goat.
Can you believe that?

37:40.372 --> 37:43.830
Thanks,
Mr. "left, left, ooh, a hole."

37:43.913 --> 37:46.830
Well, at least I wasn't following a goat.

37:46.913 --> 37:50.163
Just sit back and watch.

37:50.247 --> 37:52.663
People, lights!

38:05.913 --> 38:09.538
Let's start
with this long string of stars.

38:09.622 --> 38:11.122
This is our galaxy.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.080
The milky way.

38:14.163 --> 38:17.330
There, you can spot the w of cassiopeia,

38:17.413 --> 38:22.288
and right there on the side
is the upside down house of cepheus.

38:22.372 --> 38:24.747
The constellation is very visible...

38:24.830 --> 38:28.080
Hey, you know where
we can score some pollen around here?

38:30.913 --> 38:32.705
Okay, never mind.

38:32.788 --> 38:36.372
And watch the drooling, buddy.
It's kinda gross.

38:36.455 --> 38:39.497
Here, we come to ursa minor.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.080
See this star at the end,
brighter than the others?

38:43.163 --> 38:48.080
That's the pole star,
also known as the north star.

38:48.163 --> 38:49.538
This is great!

38:50.622 --> 38:52.872
Yeah, super amazing.

38:52.955 --> 38:56.622
Surely you'll join us
for our humble dinner.

38:56.705 --> 39:00.913
Well, we're kind of in a rush, but sure.
It's very nice of you.

39:00.997 --> 39:03.538
Marvelous.

39:03.622 --> 39:06.580
Let's start with the welcoming song.

39:07.288 --> 39:09.538
<i>♪ Thank you, strangers ♪</i>

39:09.622 --> 39:14.163
<i>♪ we will always keep

39:14.247 --> 39:16.413

39:24.205 --> 39:26.622
- We're gonna go.
- Yeah, let's go.

39:26.705 --> 39:29.330
Hey, I know these primitive peoples.

39:29.413 --> 39:32.538
They took us in. They're gonna feel hurt.

39:32.622 --> 39:35.872
Hey, we're gonna feel hurt!
We're the dinner, peanut brain!

39:35.955 --> 39:38.497
So paranoid.

39:38.580 --> 39:41.080
So scorpion.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.747
- What?
- Yummy. I can't wait to eat.

39:49.122 --> 39:50.997
Quick, get out!

39:54.330 --> 39:55.580
Tasty.

39:59.580 --> 40:02.913
You know who my dad is, right?

40:06.788 --> 40:07.788
There!

40:10.038 --> 40:11.747
Pitt, use your claws!

40:17.205 --> 40:20.538
Ajar, if you're gonna do something,
now's the time!

40:21.705 --> 40:23.747
All right, don't move!

40:23.830 --> 40:25.788
Okay, I'll stick around.

40:43.497 --> 40:44.657
- The punishing light! No!
- No!

40:44.705 --> 40:47.413
- No, no!
- Punishing light!

41:14.038 --> 41:17.705
We made it. We're on the other side.

41:18.455 --> 41:19.455
Look.

41:23.830 --> 41:25.997
You see?
We just have to follow their tracks.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.872
Let's go.

41:27.955 --> 41:29.288
Oh, please.

41:29.372 --> 41:33.788
I guess it's super sad about my sister,
but, honestly, she's probably been eaten

41:33.872 --> 41:37.372
by one of your hungry desert buddies
by now.

41:37.455 --> 41:38.455
Wow.

41:38.538 --> 41:40.997
Listen, ajar,
i don't like agreeing with him,

41:41.080 --> 41:43.372
but he's got a point.

41:43.455 --> 41:45.997
Thank you, Batman!

41:46.080 --> 41:48.288
Robin?

41:48.372 --> 41:51.663
I just wish I could do one thing right
for a change.

41:51.747 --> 41:55.872
Are you insane?
A dustie in love with my sister?

41:55.955 --> 42:00.038
I mean, besides, look at your skin.
You haven't even shed yet.

42:00.122 --> 42:03.913
You have a better chance
of dying in-in-in this place

42:03.997 --> 42:07.080
than anything ever happening
between the two of you two.

42:07.163 --> 42:09.913
Hello? Wake up!

42:09.997 --> 42:11.830
Come on!

42:12.830 --> 42:16.538
Well, I guess you're gonna need someone
to write your will.

42:16.622 --> 42:19.747
No way! Are you kidding me?

42:20.997 --> 42:23.080
No!

42:32.622 --> 42:38.580
I don't know if you're aware of this,
but it's all just sand around here.

42:38.663 --> 42:40.455

45:06.330 --> 45:08.497
Pollen.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.663
Just a couple of grains.

45:10.747 --> 45:14.205
Two. Three.

45:22.247 --> 45:26.163
I'm not gonna make it.
Tell my father I...

45:26.247 --> 45:29.288
Well, we all die someday.

45:29.372 --> 45:31.205
Huh?

45:36.538 --> 45:42.538
Oh, no! They did it! They actually did it!

45:42.622 --> 45:44.913
They blew up their bomb!

45:44.997 --> 45:48.538
A curse on both your houses!

45:48.622 --> 45:50.497
Psst. Hey!

45:50.580 --> 45:52.080
Shh!

45:52.163 --> 45:53.747
Shut up!

45:56.872 --> 46:00.872
- Honey, what are you doing?
- I'm just enjoying the view.

46:00.955 --> 46:02.622
- Huh?
- Huh?

46:02.705 --> 46:04.955
- Uh, he's not really gonna...?
- He is.

46:05.038 --> 46:08.622
Oh, that was gorgeous.

46:08.705 --> 46:10.538
That was... ew!

46:13.622 --> 46:18.580
You wanna see more of that?
Are you into this somehow?

46:18.663 --> 46:21.747
Come on, honey,
there's fresh water in the car.

46:23.038 --> 46:26.788
- Ho ho, say "cheese."
- Oh, no, please, I look awful.

46:26.872 --> 46:28.122
You look great.

46:29.663 --> 46:31.872
All right! Let's go, my friends.

46:49.747 --> 46:51.955
Where did I leave my keys?

46:55.497 --> 46:58.330
Whoa!

46:59.830 --> 47:01.163
Pollen.

47:01.247 --> 47:05.413
- No, Gary, don't move!
- My precious.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.122
Uh-oh, folks.

47:10.205 --> 47:12.913
Seems like we invited a little snake
into the car.

47:14.247 --> 47:16.788
Don't panic. Just lift up your feet.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.538
Oh, you're a bad little snake.
You're a...

47:24.622 --> 47:25.747
Gary, quick, get out!

47:27.622 --> 47:29.413
Careful, my friends, don't move.

47:31.747 --> 47:34.372
Okay, everybody, now just relax.

47:38.038 --> 47:40.455
Now there's a cobra.

47:40.538 --> 47:42.788
Come back here!

47:42.872 --> 47:45.122
Got him! How exciting!

47:49.288 --> 47:53.372
- Pitt!
- He hasn't even shed his skin yet.

47:58.413 --> 48:00.247
I can't.

48:03.747 --> 48:04.913
Whoa!

48:04.997 --> 48:09.163
Don't be such a drama queen.
He's tough.

48:10.497 --> 48:15.913
He'll just put everyone to sleep with
that little stingy thing he does so well.

48:15.997 --> 48:19.122
- This is all your fault!
- True that.

48:19.205 --> 48:22.330
Since the beginning, you've been nothing
but a giant pain in the tail!

48:22.413 --> 48:24.455
It's true. I wasn't very helpful.

48:24.538 --> 48:28.122
And now my best...
My only friend is getting crushed.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.872
Yeah, probably.

48:31.997 --> 48:34.538
Can you stop that agreeing thing
you've got going on?

48:34.622 --> 48:36.580
It's really annoying.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.872
Okay, sorry.

48:38.955 --> 48:39.997
Ahem.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.997
What? How was that my fault?

48:43.080 --> 48:47.205
Who wanted to play knight in shining armor
with my sister?

48:47.288 --> 48:51.372
- I'm gonna kill you!
- You're just saying that.

48:51.455 --> 48:53.663
Hey! Watch it, okay?

48:53.747 --> 48:57.788
I'm pretty well trained in kung fu
so you don't wanna get me mad.

49:01.372 --> 49:02.413
Dragon tail.

49:06.205 --> 49:09.955
So, have you learned your lesson?
You've had enough?

49:10.038 --> 49:13.955
We've gotta find that camelcade.
That's our only clue so far.

49:14.038 --> 49:17.455
We get Eva,
but we don't go home without pitt.

49:17.538 --> 49:20.788
"We get Eva,
but we don't go home without pitt."

49:30.705 --> 49:33.455
Flower, George, flower.

49:33.538 --> 49:36.122
Yes, just like that.

49:36.205 --> 49:38.872
Eva, good move.

49:39.872 --> 49:45.288
Butterfly, seahorse.
Again. Let's sweat it out.

49:45.372 --> 49:48.205
It took me 20 years to get it right.

49:49.372 --> 49:51.455
Twenty years?

49:51.538 --> 49:54.372
You've been locked up in here
for 20 years?

49:54.455 --> 49:59.122
Yes, my dear.
Dance is a demanding art form.

49:59.205 --> 50:00.913
- What about you?
- Me?

50:00.997 --> 50:04.955
- It's my 11th year of success.
- Eleven?

50:05.955 --> 50:08.330
This can't be.

50:08.413 --> 50:10.205
Oh, these kids.

50:10.288 --> 50:13.913
They think everything should be
handed to them on a silver platter.

50:20.747 --> 50:25.288
- I understand, you know.
- Please, I need to be alone right now.

50:25.372 --> 50:30.247
Try to overlook my very good looks,
my irresistible charm.

50:30.330 --> 50:34.038
I'm not just a swift-tailed
string of muscles.

50:34.122 --> 50:37.997
I'm a snake like you.
With a heart like yours.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.247
Can you hear it?

50:40.330 --> 50:44.455
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
It knows what you feel.

50:44.538 --> 50:49.372
The uprooting,
the solitude, the confinement.

50:49.455 --> 50:52.038
That's the price we pay
for the life we chose.

50:52.122 --> 50:55.830
- I didn't choose this.
- Even better. It chose you.

50:55.913 --> 50:57.830
Destiny brought us together.

50:57.913 --> 51:00.330
Ha ha! It's fate.

51:07.538 --> 51:09.705
No one is going
to come rescue you, sweetie.

51:09.788 --> 51:13.122
And all around us,
it's pretty much just sand and death.

51:13.205 --> 51:16.288
But, if you still want to escape,
i know a way.

51:16.372 --> 51:19.372
You really want me out of here, don't you?

51:19.455 --> 51:22.788
Sooner or later, Omar is going to make us
dance against each other.

51:22.872 --> 51:25.330
I'd just rather skip that part.

51:29.580 --> 51:33.163
All you have to do is drop onto the sand
without a sound.

51:33.247 --> 51:36.955
It's daytime.
He has no reason to be playing his flute.

51:37.038 --> 51:38.955
No one's going to see you.

51:39.038 --> 51:41.747
You just go and you're free.

51:43.330 --> 51:45.163
You did this?

51:45.247 --> 51:46.913
There was a time when I too thought

51:46.997 --> 51:49.455
the sand was shinier
on the other side of the rock.

51:49.538 --> 51:52.122
But it's all just sand.

51:52.205 --> 51:54.205
- Thank you for... oh.
- Go.

51:59.997 --> 52:05.122
Just what do you think you're doing?
It ain't strolling time, miss.

52:05.205 --> 52:09.705
Well, actually, there's been a mistake.
See, I shouldn't be here.

52:09.788 --> 52:11.413
Hey, Jerry.

52:13.288 --> 52:15.080
"I shouldn't be here."

52:16.288 --> 52:18.497
They're all the same!

52:18.580 --> 52:20.622
Back inside.

52:20.705 --> 52:21.997
Huh?

52:22.080 --> 52:25.080
- Oh, will you just go away?
- Stop!

52:26.955 --> 52:29.538
We got a wild one! Escape alert!

52:29.622 --> 52:32.163
She's getting away!

53:10.830 --> 53:12.372
Hmm.

53:13.705 --> 53:15.497
What is this?

53:15.580 --> 53:18.830
Snakes who'll end up as belts
or designer shoes.

53:18.913 --> 53:21.288
Oh, my god. That's horrible.

53:23.997 --> 53:27.122
I have a better idea.

53:29.955 --> 53:33.288
I should've let you finish me off,
now that I think about it.

53:33.372 --> 53:37.372
Plus you'd feel really bad right now.

53:38.372 --> 53:41.288
So you actually have two modes, huh?

53:41.372 --> 53:45.872
Crazy angry wrestler or silent antisocial.

53:45.955 --> 53:49.080
So sophisticated.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.997
- Whoa!
- Hey!

53:54.538 --> 53:57.288
Move over! Dibs!

53:57.372 --> 53:59.372
Wha...?

54:05.372 --> 54:07.288
What is that?

54:10.163 --> 54:13.247
Uh... hi.

54:13.330 --> 54:16.747
Would you by any chance know where
we could find water or shade around here?

54:25.163 --> 54:26.372
Wha...?

54:26.455 --> 54:28.622
Ask him if he ran into a camelcade.

54:28.705 --> 54:31.413
Why don't you ask him?

54:31.497 --> 54:34.372
I don't talk to stuff I don't know.

54:36.913 --> 54:38.122
Pardon me, sir.

54:38.205 --> 54:41.788
You wouldn't have come across
a camelcade by any chance?

54:46.622 --> 54:48.806
You mean a camelcade
heading towards souksoukville with men,

54:48.830 --> 54:50.306
one of whom traveled with two hampers

54:50.330 --> 54:52.690
from which a green snake
was dangling, attempting to escape?

54:52.747 --> 54:54.788
Yes! Yes, that's it.

54:54.872 --> 54:55.913
Hmm.

54:55.997 --> 54:59.497
- Nah. Doesn't ring a bell.
- What? How's that possible?

54:59.580 --> 55:01.955
Which way is soukso...
Whatever its name is?

55:08.497 --> 55:12.455
I'm sorry. You were mentioning
a certain city, I believe?

55:15.038 --> 55:16.122
Souksoukville?

55:16.205 --> 55:19.038
A little city from the 15th century
protected by 18-foot fortifications

55:19.122 --> 55:21.705
with a network of streets
that's been classified as unesco's...

55:21.788 --> 55:24.788
- Yes, yes. Where is it?
- Nah. Never heard of it.

55:25.788 --> 55:28.455
Wait! Wait!

55:30.247 --> 55:32.163
Come back!

55:37.997 --> 55:41.372
Well, at least we're slithering
in the right direction.

55:41.455 --> 55:44.122
Oh, yeah? So where's souksoukville?

55:44.205 --> 55:47.580
Oh, you're such a
"the glass is half-empty" kind of guy.

55:47.663 --> 55:49.372
So scorpion.

55:49.455 --> 55:52.038
You've hung out
with that doofus for too long.

55:52.122 --> 55:54.205
Don't you ever talk about pitt like that.

55:54.288 --> 55:55.830
There you go again.

56:02.955 --> 56:06.372
There, an oasis!

56:06.455 --> 56:08.247
Yeah, right. I'm not falling for that.

56:08.330 --> 56:10.705
- I swear! There!
- Huh?

56:23.705 --> 56:26.663
See? Right direction.

56:28.372 --> 56:31.413
- We gotta get going.
- Oh, come on!

56:31.497 --> 56:36.372
Five more minutes.
Look at all these blisters.

56:36.455 --> 56:39.247
I can't possibly make another move.

56:39.330 --> 56:41.538
Okay, we'll spend the night here.

56:41.622 --> 56:44.038
- We need to regain our strength.
- Really?

56:44.122 --> 56:46.288
Yay!

56:46.497 --> 56:47.788
Whoo-hoo!

57:11.372 --> 57:12.913
Shh!

57:18.663 --> 57:21.288
<i>The desert is ruthless.</i>

57:22.663 --> 57:25.747
<i>Even to its own children.</i>

57:27.705 --> 57:30.538
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

57:31.663 --> 57:34.913
Sometimes it's a place for many.

57:34.997 --> 57:39.955
Other times, only one can survive.

58:04.163 --> 58:06.413

59:58.955 --> 01:00:02.622
Come on, troopers!
Only eight hours left to get there!

01:00:02.705 --> 01:00:06.205
You're gonna have the opportunity
of seeing an australopithecus skull.

01:00:06.288 --> 01:00:10.663
- And they named her Lucy.
- It's just a pile of bones.

01:00:10.747 --> 01:00:15.413
- Thousands of years old bones.
- Okay, so old bones.

01:00:15.497 --> 01:00:18.872
When I think about all my girlfriends
at the death sting concert,

01:00:18.955 --> 01:00:20.788
just how did I end up here?

01:00:20.872 --> 01:00:25.913
Maybe we should take a break, honey.
It looks really fine right here.

01:00:27.663 --> 01:00:31.538
Something moved!
The shoe, it moved.

01:00:31.622 --> 01:00:35.205
It could be a mongoose or a gerbil.
Everyone, get behind me.

01:00:36.955 --> 01:00:39.247
Hey, you in there! Get out of there!

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:45.580
See? You overreacted again, honey.

01:00:45.663 --> 01:00:48.955
You keep making a fool of yourself.

01:00:52.038 --> 01:00:53.580
Good evening, sir.

01:00:53.663 --> 01:00:57.872
Would you mind if we rested
in your humble home for the night?

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:00.538
Uh, I...

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:09.038
I can't feel my tail. This is the end.

01:01:09.122 --> 01:01:12.955
I don't blame you. Well, maybe I do.

01:01:13.038 --> 01:01:17.038
Bury yourself in the sand,
that'll make you feel warm.

01:01:17.122 --> 01:01:18.122
Yeah.

01:01:19.372 --> 01:01:20.580
Ahh.

01:01:22.163 --> 01:01:25.997
- What are you thinking about?
- Pitt.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.372
And Eva.

01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:30.413
We may never see 'em again.

01:01:30.497 --> 01:01:33.580
Well, you can thank life for that.

01:01:33.663 --> 01:01:35.205
I'm sorry, what?

01:01:35.288 --> 01:01:39.538
Well, at least you've had that, a friend.

01:01:39.622 --> 01:01:42.747
About my sister, I still think
you're better off without her, but...

01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:44.580
Wait. You don't have a friend?

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:48.413
What? Of course I have friends. Tons!

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:50.955
I mean, do you know who my father is?

01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:52.413
You know.

01:01:58.705 --> 01:02:02.872
You never told me,
how did you and pitt meet?

01:02:02.955 --> 01:02:05.830
- His family was killed by the tuaregs.
- Oh.

01:02:05.913 --> 01:02:09.122
- Barbecue? Keychain?
- We never knew.

01:02:09.205 --> 01:02:14.205
He got away, god knows how,
and he ended up in the suburbs with us.

01:02:14.288 --> 01:02:17.288
Two losers among losers.
We hit it off right away.

01:02:17.372 --> 01:02:21.997
Yeah, kinda like us.
I mean, except I'm not a loser, of course.

01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:29.163
You think Eva...?

01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:32.247
I mean, do you think
i stand a chance with her?

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.080
I know we were only together
a few minutes

01:02:34.163 --> 01:02:36.372
but I thought I felt something there.

01:02:36.455 --> 01:02:39.288
Oh, pollen.

01:02:39.372 --> 01:02:43.455
Oh, precious.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:50.580
And then, I ran into Gary,
and using just my claws,

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:55.455
I freed him from the atrocious mucus
while ajar was just...

01:02:56.663 --> 01:02:58.163
What?

01:02:58.247 --> 01:03:01.288
You are so brave.

01:03:01.372 --> 01:03:04.830
Really? Well, I... huh.

01:03:10.955 --> 01:03:12.997
Why don't you
come with us, sweetie?

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.205
Oh, that's really nice of you, but ajar...

01:03:17.288 --> 01:03:20.455
You're a scorpion.
You belong with scorpions.

01:03:20.538 --> 01:03:22.747
Leave him alone, you guys.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.622
Can't you see
he's gotta go find his friend?

01:03:24.705 --> 01:03:28.122
Ew, that was so dripping with love.

01:03:28.205 --> 01:03:29.205
What?

01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:32.038
No way. Shut up, you little dung beetle.

01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:37.372
Okay, let's get going so we can reach
souksoukville before the storm.

01:03:37.455 --> 01:03:40.830
You'll get to see the tuaregs
and their show with the dancing snakes.

01:03:40.913 --> 01:03:43.330
- Huh?
- You don't want to miss that, believe me.

01:03:56.497 --> 01:03:59.038
Where did he fall this time?

01:03:59.122 --> 01:04:02.663
Gary, where on earth are you?

01:04:02.747 --> 01:04:05.538
If you got yourself into another hole,
I'm gonna...

01:04:05.622 --> 01:04:08.372
Over here!

01:04:11.205 --> 01:04:14.163
Check it out! It's a fogara!

01:04:14.247 --> 01:04:16.580
Kinda like an underground river.

01:04:16.663 --> 01:04:18.788
- Fascinating.
- Don't you get it?

01:04:18.872 --> 01:04:22.205
These things bring water
to villages, cities.

01:04:23.872 --> 01:04:27.163
Like souksoukville, for instance.

01:04:27.247 --> 01:04:30.913
We get in, take a ride, and there we are.

01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:32.497
Uh, no.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.663
- We'd better stick with the surface.
- Oh, it's gonna take days.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:39.163
We're not even sure that foga-thing
goes to souksoukville.

01:04:39.247 --> 01:04:41.872
Well, it goes somewhere.

01:04:47.955 --> 01:04:50.497
Listen, I can't swim, okay?

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.580
Hm?

01:04:51.663 --> 01:04:55.330
I live in the desert.
We don't do a lot of surfing over here.

01:04:57.663 --> 01:05:00.622
Well, looks like we'll die
in the storm anyway.

01:05:00.705 --> 01:05:02.955
Besides, i... wait, what?

01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:14.663
Ready?

01:05:14.747 --> 01:05:17.872
I can't believe the last thing
I'll ever see is your face.

01:05:17.955 --> 01:05:20.372
I take that as a yes.

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.163
Whoo-hoo!

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:46.705
- Oh, boy.
- Look out.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:02.038
- Swim!
- I'm trying!

Huh? Oh.

01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:03.955
Okay, we've gotta find the man
who kidnapped Eva.

01:08:05.163 --> 01:08:08.497
- Uh, Omar?
- I don't know his name.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.288
Tall, skinny, scary-faced?

01:08:12.205 --> 01:08:14.705
- His shop is that way.
- Huh?

01:08:15.913 --> 01:08:17.537
That's him.

01:08:19.247 --> 01:08:21.455
Let's use the rooftops. It's safer.

01:08:23.037 --> 01:08:24.497
Ohh.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.580
What?

01:08:53.787 --> 01:08:56.247
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.247
Look, Eva. Shh.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.912
Let me speak.

01:09:08.997 --> 01:09:12.205
I understand why you and i
will never be a thing.

01:09:12.287 --> 01:09:14.247
It's no problem.

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.747
We are all looking
for different things in life.

01:09:34.412 --> 01:09:37.080
You'll see, you'll get used to it.

01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:39.372
It's not that bad a life.

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:41.205
It's just...

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:44.247
It's not what I imagined my life
would be like.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:45.872
It never is.

01:09:59.747 --> 01:10:01.330
Oh, boy.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.247
Hey, where are you going?

01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:07.538
You know what? You're right.

01:10:07.622 --> 01:10:09.330
It's not like we crossed a whole desert

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:13.580
and almost died, like, 26 times
in horrifying ways to get here.

01:10:15.538 --> 01:10:17.580
So? Are you coming or not?

01:10:18.413 --> 01:10:19.663
Have you seen this guy?

01:10:19.747 --> 01:10:22.163
You don't stand a chance
with a guy like that.

01:10:22.247 --> 01:10:24.955
So out of your league, bro.

01:10:25.038 --> 01:10:27.830
- Are you done?
- Well, that depends.

01:10:27.913 --> 01:10:32.622
Are you just gonna stand there and whine
or are you gonna save my sister?

01:10:37.163 --> 01:10:40.372
Did you put up with me
all those miles for nothing?

01:10:44.538 --> 01:10:46.747
Huh, huh? Yeah!

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:53.205
- Ajar?
- No, it's George.

01:10:53.288 --> 01:10:56.330
- Oh, it's my brother!
- Your brother's name is ajar?

01:11:04.163 --> 01:11:07.913
- He's her boyfriend?
- That's so romantic.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:09.038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:11:09.122 --> 01:11:10.372
She's dating her brother?

01:11:17.163 --> 01:11:19.038
Wait. Just hold it there.

01:11:23.788 --> 01:11:26.247
I can't hold on anymore.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.747
Who's there?

01:11:46.372 --> 01:11:48.747
Ah.

01:11:53.913 --> 01:11:56.330
What have you done?

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:02.747
- Ajar, you came.
- Let's go!

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:06.622
Trying to escape, my cuties?

01:12:06.705 --> 01:12:09.788
Do you really think
you can get away from me?

01:12:12.955 --> 01:12:18.038
You stupid worm.
You think your venom can hurt me?

01:12:19.038 --> 01:12:22.872
Gary! As long as Omar has his flute,
he controls us.

01:12:22.955 --> 01:12:26.205
Your venom runs in my veins!

01:12:28.205 --> 01:12:31.163
You're mine!

01:12:32.288 --> 01:12:35.747
No! Ah! Come back!

01:14:29.955 --> 01:14:32.747
That belongs to me.

01:14:36.455 --> 01:14:37.455
Oops.

01:14:39.038 --> 01:14:41.997
- Oops again.
- You're going to pay for this.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.163
You're all going to pay!

01:14:59.705 --> 01:15:00.705
Ah!

01:15:18.163 --> 01:15:19.580
Ajar?

01:15:21.413 --> 01:15:23.080
Ajar?

01:15:24.372 --> 01:15:28.122
Ajar! Oh, no.

01:15:32.205 --> 01:15:35.538
Ajar. Are you all right?

01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:42.288
- Oh, please, no.
- Breathe.

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:50.663
- Ajar!
- I knew it.

01:15:53.205 --> 01:15:55.788
- Oh, sorry.
- Still hurts.

01:15:57.038 --> 01:15:58.747
Your skin.

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:01.122
Pretty.

01:16:01.205 --> 01:16:03.455
That's gonna be high maintenance.

01:16:05.788 --> 01:16:08.955
You... you crossed the desert for me?

01:16:09.038 --> 01:16:10.872
I would have crossed a thousand.

01:16:10.955 --> 01:16:12.497
Ah.

01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:28.330
Huh?!

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:34.622
Huh?

01:16:36.955 --> 01:16:40.705
- So, who's the man?
- Pitt!

01:16:40.788 --> 01:16:43.955
Oh, buddy, I missed you so much.

01:16:46.955 --> 01:16:48.455
Wow.

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:51.330
- Is this new?
- Long story.

01:16:51.413 --> 01:16:53.330
You remember Eva?

01:16:53.413 --> 01:16:56.288
I don't believe
I've met your friend over there.

01:16:56.372 --> 01:16:58.080
Yeah. Um...

01:16:58.788 --> 01:17:02.955
Ajar, this is Emily.
Emily, this is...

01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:04.872
Oh, pitt told me so much about you.

01:17:04.955 --> 01:17:07.205
I mean, the glow worms,
the snake killer birds,

01:17:07.288 --> 01:17:08.580
the attack of the mongooses,

01:17:08.663 --> 01:17:11.622
the ride on the back of the oryx,
the man-eating lions.

01:17:11.705 --> 01:17:13.538
I know about everything.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:18.830
And knowing pitt like I do,
I'm sure he was really modest about it.

01:17:21.788 --> 01:17:23.663
Here we go!

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:28.580
Welcome, my friends,
to our discovery tour of the Sahara.

01:17:36.163 --> 01:17:38.497
By the way, do you dance?

01:17:56.497 --> 01:17:58.413
You know, I just love dance.

01:17:58.497 --> 01:18:01.830
Ballet, tutus,
all that kind of stuff.

01:18:01.913 --> 01:18:03.455
Mm.

01:18:03.538 --> 01:18:06.163
That is so weird.

01:18:06.247 --> 01:18:09.872
Because I just love
handsome, super rich heirs!

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.288
We were so meant for each other.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.455
Hm?

01:18:38.122 --> 01:18:41.163
I know. You're wondering if ajar
and Eva will go back to the oasis,

01:18:41.247 --> 01:18:45.497
love each other forever and help everyone
live happily ever after as equals? Hm?

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.830
Uh... yeah.

01:18:49.705 --> 01:18:52.538
