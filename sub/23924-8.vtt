00:00.066 --> 00:02.402
Dad's gonna kill you

00:02.435 --> 00:03.669
if he finds out you took
his autographed pin.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.039
Let's see how far

00:05.072 --> 00:07.541
- we can shove it down our throats.
- Cool!

00:11.042 --> 00:12.912
You only got 4 inches.

00:14.446 --> 00:15.549
Help me push it in further.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.850
Okay!

00:18.518 --> 00:19.853
Hi.

00:19.885 --> 00:21.754
Can I play with you guys?

00:21.788 --> 00:23.757
- Hey, it's that crippled loser.
- Get him!

00:25.925 --> 00:28.929
Oh, Mr...

Bullies

00:49.713 --> 00:51.350
Huh?

00:51.383 --> 00:52.618
Tommy?

00:52.651 --> 00:54.754
The bullies beat me up.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.623
Who are the bullies?

00:56.656 --> 00:59.326
The Blorpton boys.

00:59.358 --> 01:01.395
Well, son, it's time I teach
you how to fight...

01:01.428 --> 01:03.764
And stand up for yourself like a man!

01:03.796 --> 01:05.331
- No!
- Okay. Sorry.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.933
Violence isn't the answer.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.436
I'm sure if I drive Tommy over there,

01:09.469 --> 01:11.505
we can work this out peacefully.

01:11.537 --> 01:12.805
But every time you drive my truck,

01:12.838 --> 01:14.674
it gets damaged.

01:14.707 --> 01:17.310
Why don't you get your old
bike from the barn, huh?

01:17.344 --> 01:18.678
Ugh.

01:20.380 --> 01:21.782
We're here.

01:21.814 --> 01:22.882
Phew.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.385
Hi. I'm Beverly.

01:27.419 --> 01:29.823
Oh, uh, and this is my son.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.726
- Hey, what's that loser doing here?
- Yeah, loser!

01:32.758 --> 01:36.529
Oh, uh,
we brought you some muffins because...

01:36.562 --> 01:39.099
What?
You think I can't feed my own family?

01:39.132 --> 01:40.334
Uh...

01:40.367 --> 01:41.567
Lunch is ready, boys!

01:41.600 --> 01:42.868
- Oh, great, I'm starving.
- Yay!

01:42.901 --> 01:45.739
Mmm.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.541
Hey, no teeth!

01:47.573 --> 01:50.977
Uh, aren't your kids a
little old to be nursing?

01:51.010 --> 01:52.579
Are you judging me?

01:52.612 --> 01:54.548
What the hell do you want anyway, bitch?

01:54.581 --> 01:57.683
Oh. See, our sons got into
a little fight, so I...

01:57.716 --> 01:58.651
Is this true, boys?

01:58.684 --> 01:59.953
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.121
We kicked his ass.

02:01.153 --> 02:02.355
Aah!

02:02.388 --> 02:03.656
And he's still walking?

02:03.689 --> 02:05.524
If you're gonna beat somebody

02:05.558 --> 02:07.960
up, take them all... the... way... down.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.895
- Stop!
- Huh?

02:09.929 --> 02:11.832
Hitting them won't solve anything.

02:11.864 --> 02:15.000
First you judge me, then my husband?

02:15.046 --> 02:15.595
No, I...

02:15.648 --> 02:18.405
You think you can be
a better parent to our kids?

02:18.437 --> 02:19.606
- Well, take them.
- What?

02:19.638 --> 02:21.040
Yeah. We hate our kids.

02:21.073 --> 02:23.844
Come on, bitch. Let's go bowling.

02:23.876 --> 02:25.544
But, Oh...

02:25.577 --> 02:26.779
Uh, no, wait.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.750
- Huh?
- Now what?

02:29.782 --> 02:31.417
Uh...

02:31.451 --> 02:32.886
- Ow.
- Hey!

02:32.918 --> 02:35.154
Boys, boys, boys!

02:35.187 --> 02:37.089
Boys, behave!

02:37.123 --> 02:39.493
I know what will calm you boys down.

02:39.525 --> 02:41.794
- Who wants sandwiches?
- Great, I'm starving.

02:41.827 --> 02:42.895
No! Oh!

02:42.929 --> 02:43.897
We want milk!

02:43.929 --> 02:45.965
No! Oh! No, stop!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.100
Let's see if the old man

02:47.132 --> 02:48.167
has any milk in those man boobs.

02:48.201 --> 02:51.605
Beverly, I can't believe
you took these hooligans in.

02:51.637 --> 02:53.672
- Hey! Get off of me!
- Feed us old man.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.643
Their parents went bowling
and just left them with me.

02:56.675 --> 02:57.911
Aw, he's all dried up.

02:57.943 --> 02:59.446
Boys, how would you like me

02:59.478 --> 03:00.913
to take you back to your parents, huh?

03:00.947 --> 03:02.149
Oh!

03:02.181 --> 03:03.583
I'll go find their parents.

03:03.615 --> 03:04.750
- Stop that.
- Huh?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.419
You boys need a spanking.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.087
No. I can handle this.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.724
Tommy,
go get some toys they can play with.

03:10.756 --> 03:12.591
- Okay, Mom.
- It's okay.

03:12.625 --> 03:13.827
- We brought our mom's toys.
- Mom's toys!

03:13.859 --> 03:15.828
Sword fight!

03:15.862 --> 03:19.566
- Aah!
- Boys, get back here!

03:26.506 --> 03:28.942
A 7-10 split, that shot is impossible.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.776
You can do it, Sheriff!

03:33.880 --> 03:35.582
Hey. What did you do that for?

03:35.614 --> 03:36.982
- This is our lane.
- Yeah!

03:37.016 --> 03:38.984
Do you know who you're messing with?

03:39.018 --> 03:40.654
- Yeah, pussies.
- Oh.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.954
You ain't bikers.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.824
You don't even ride motorcycles.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.226
Uh, we used to,
but they're too dangerous.

03:46.258 --> 03:47.226
Yoink!

03:47.260 --> 03:48.794
Aah! I hate bullies.

03:48.827 --> 03:49.862
Easy, Louie.

03:49.895 --> 03:51.797
Leave the Blorptons alone, huh?

03:51.831 --> 03:53.099
So you're the Blorptons?

03:53.131 --> 03:54.533
- Huh?
- Huh?

03:54.566 --> 03:56.837
You need to come get
your kids from my house.

03:56.869 --> 03:59.105
- We don't want them.
- Yeah!

04:01.107 --> 04:03.175
Why don't you bowl for it?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.944
Loser keeps the kids.

04:04.977 --> 04:06.846
What? That's ridiculous.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.548
What's the matter? Chicken?

04:08.581 --> 04:09.950
Bock, bock, bock, bock,
bock, bock, bock, bock.

04:09.982 --> 04:12.918
Chicken noises, huh?
That'll never work on me.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.888
Bock, bock, bock, bock,
bock, bock, bock, bock, bock.

04:16.962 --> 04:18.123
Chicken.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.527
- Stop!
- Sword fight!

04:20.560 --> 04:21.795
- No! Don't stab me!
- Get him!

04:21.827 --> 04:23.162
No! Please stop!

04:23.195 --> 04:23.929
Aah!

04:23.964 --> 04:25.966
Let's use the toys on Tommy...

04:25.998 --> 04:27.833
- No!
- ...the way Mom uses them on Dad.

04:27.866 --> 04:28.968
Yeah!

04:29.002 --> 04:30.570
No!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.105
Whoa!

04:32.137 --> 04:33.272
Boys.

04:33.305 --> 04:34.808
Huh?

04:34.841 --> 04:37.143
What is it gonna take for you to behave?

04:37.175 --> 04:38.712
Maybe some milk.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.012
- Oh.
- Milk, milk, milk, milk.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.815
Stop.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.183
Isn't there anything
you boys like to eat

04:43.216 --> 04:44.518
besides milk?

04:44.550 --> 04:45.685
No.

04:45.717 --> 04:47.553
Not even cake?

04:47.587 --> 04:48.854
- Uh...
- Uh, all right.

04:48.887 --> 04:50.257
We do like cake.

04:50.289 --> 04:52.825
Then let's walk to the
store and get some cake mix.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.827
Huh? Why can't you drive there?

04:54.861 --> 04:56.062
Uh...

04:56.094 --> 04:58.030
Dad doesn't let her drive the truck

04:58.063 --> 04:59.832
because she always damages it.

04:59.865 --> 05:01.601
- Ha! She can't drive.
- She can't drive.

05:01.707 --> 05:02.702
- She can't drive.
- She can't drive.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.941
- Oh!
- Ooh, gutter ball.

05:09.241 --> 05:11.176
I want to hurt those damn bullies.

05:12.878 --> 05:14.213
What's wrong, Rick?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.750
Usually you love hurting bullies.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.050
Eh, don't worry about it.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.084
Yeah.

05:19.118 --> 05:20.887
Squirt! Squirt! Whoa!

05:22.221 --> 05:24.024
Ohh! Ohh!

05:24.057 --> 05:25.725
Sheriff, they're cheating.

05:25.757 --> 05:28.228
Wow, a 7-10 split.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.130
- What?
- That shot is impossible.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.199
They're cheating. Sheriff, do something.

05:33.231 --> 05:35.101
How about I bowl for you?

05:35.134 --> 05:36.870
- Uh.
- Trust me, bud.

05:36.902 --> 05:37.970
I got this.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.242
- Oh!
- Oh, well.

05:42.274 --> 05:44.109
Guess the Blorptons' kids are yours now.

05:44.142 --> 05:45.911
See you later.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.048
Fine.
You're not fit to raise kids anyway.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.950
- What?
- Oh, yeah?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.885
This isn't over.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.754
We'll be seeing you <i> real</i> soon.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.121
Yeah.

05:58.123 --> 05:59.725
Oh. No!

05:59.759 --> 06:01.895
Oh, boys, behave. Stop!

06:04.329 --> 06:07.233
Hey! You need to control your kids.

06:07.265 --> 06:08.968
- They're not my kids.
- Come on. Let's take his legs.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.905
Hey! Oh, hey!

06:14.272 --> 06:16.208
Hey! Get out of the road.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.977
Shut up, pussy.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.111
Oh, damn.

06:19.144 --> 06:20.312
Bullies.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.115
Boys, what is going on out here?

06:22.147 --> 06:23.248
You need to handle your kids.

06:23.281 --> 06:24.683
Oh, they're not my kids.

06:24.716 --> 06:26.620
You need to spank your kids.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.022
No. Violence never solves anything.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.123
That's not true.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.358
Violence solves everything.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.195
What do you know?
You don't even ride motorcycles.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.097
None of you pussies do.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.298
Hey!

06:38.330 --> 06:40.766
Boys, motorcycles are dangerous.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.969
She's right. Listen to your mom, kids.

06:43.002 --> 06:46.006
- They're not my kids.
- What does she know about motorcycles?

06:46.038 --> 06:47.640
She can't even drive.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.409
Yeah, because she's a pussy.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.043
- Aah!
- Ow!

06:52.712 --> 06:53.880
What are you doing?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.815
Time to teach some bullies a lesson.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.951
- Bye.
- Where are you taking them?

06:57.983 --> 06:59.318
Bye!

06:59.351 --> 07:01.887
Oh,
they've got a clubhouse down that way,

07:01.921 --> 07:03.356
but you can't get in without wheels,

07:03.389 --> 07:05.358
and apparently, you can't drive,

07:05.390 --> 07:06.859
so oh, well.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.798
Mom, why did you get so much cake mix,
huh?

07:12.832 --> 07:14.334
Go get my mixer

07:14.366 --> 07:17.003
and everything else from the kitchen.

07:24.643 --> 07:26.178
So what are you doing, Mom?

07:26.212 --> 07:28.313
- Huh? Mom!
- Go play with Mr. Pickles.

07:28.346 --> 07:30.315
Mom is busy.

07:31.974 --> 07:35.187
Come on, Rick.
Let's spank these bullies.

07:35.221 --> 07:36.356
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

07:36.389 --> 07:37.891
Ah, I don't feel like it today.

07:37.923 --> 07:38.991
- What?
- Fine.

07:39.024 --> 07:40.459
I'll do it myself.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.062
You spank like a pussy,

07:43.096 --> 07:44.329
- you pussy.
- Pussy.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.332
Bring out the torture devices.

07:47.365 --> 07:48.767
All right.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.738
Oh. What's this big-ass cake doing here?

07:51.771 --> 07:54.374
Ah, guys, you did remember my birthday!

07:54.406 --> 07:55.709
Birthday?

07:55.741 --> 07:58.477
Uh, I mean, happy birthday.

07:58.510 --> 07:59.378
- Huh?
- What?

08:03.082 --> 08:05.485
You messed with the wrong mom.

08:06.918 --> 08:08.755
Come on, boys.

08:08.788 --> 08:12.025
- Get her!
- Dang, she slashed our tires.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.226
Get the motorcycles.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.207
Get her!

08:35.914 --> 08:37.250
- Watch out!
- Banana!

08:37.282 --> 08:38.118
Aah! Aah!

09:15.320 --> 09:16.288
Go get her!

09:26.866 --> 09:28.300
- Get her!
- All right.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.839
Oh, no!

09:39.011 --> 09:40.280
Hey.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.448
You need to punish your kids.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.383
Don't talk with your mouth full.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.485
Ohh! Ohh!

09:47.420 --> 09:51.858
You boys better be on your
best behavior from now on.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.360
We promise.

09:54.392 --> 09:56.128
See?

09:56.161 --> 09:58.464
Motorcycles are dangerous.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.599
Ow.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.868
- Please just...
- What are you doing?

10:01.901 --> 10:03.335
- Guys, come on.
- Really?

10:03.368 --> 10:05.904
All right. What seems to be the problem,
Mr. Goodman?

10:05.938 --> 10:09.209
- Really? Look.
- Oh, that's probably illegal.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.145
All right. Let's go to jail, Blorptons.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.579
- Huh?
- Mom?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.349
You took our kids on a motorcycle?

10:16.382 --> 10:18.885
- She's scary.
- Can we come home?

10:18.917 --> 10:22.888
Maybe you should 'cause I'm a bad,
bad mom.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.923
Nunh-unh, no take backs. Run!

10:24.956 --> 10:26.992
7-10 split.

10:30.396 --> 10:32.098
Aah! Aah! Aah!

10:33.599 --> 10:35.868
Beverly, my truck.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.271
As soon as we're out of these casts,

10:38.304 --> 10:41.040
we're gonna beat all your asses.

10:41.073 --> 10:44.377
- Get well soon, now.
- I can feed my own family.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.179
Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum.

10:46.211 --> 10:47.379
So you're the parents?

10:47.412 --> 10:49.047
Well, you're the problem.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.182
Ugh.

10:50.612 --> 10:54.520
Oh, guys, you did remember my birthday!

10:54.552 --> 10:57.222
Pinatas, my favorite!

11:12.371 --> 11:13.855
- I will.
- Bye, Dave.
