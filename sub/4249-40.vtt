- I PROMISE.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.233
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH RUFUS, OKAY?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.235
NINA'S JUST...

10:53.319 --> 10:55.446
WORRIED ABOUT HER GRAM,
THAT'S ALL.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.573
SHE'S SKIPPED CLASS,
AND WE'RE COVERING FOR HER.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.367
- AND THAT'S ALL, IS IT?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.869
- YEAH.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.730
- [groans]

11:40.950 --> 11:43.411
[grunts]

11:43.494 --> 11:46.497
[gasps]

11:47.706 --> 11:48.916
HELLO?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.918
- I ASSURE YOU,

11:51.001 --> 11:54.004
THERE IS NO WAY OUT.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.297
- VICTOR!

11:55.381 --> 11:56.298
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.759
- IMPOSSIBLE...

11:58.843 --> 12:05.349
AS I FOUND TO MY COST
MANY, MANY YEARS AGO.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.059
- YOU'RE NOT VICTOR.

12:07.143 --> 12:12.898
- MY NAME IS
VICTOR RODENMAAR SR.

12:12.982 --> 12:17.987
I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING
TO MY WORTHLESS SON.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.489
- BUT THAT WOULD MAKE YOU...

12:20.573 --> 12:22.199
- DEAD AS A DOORKNOB, MY DEAR.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.244
YES.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.495
- THEN...

12:26.579 --> 12:27.872
[breathes heavily]

12:27.955 --> 12:28.998
MEANS THAT I'M--

12:29.081 --> 12:32.877
- ON THE CONTRARY,
YOU ARE VERY MUCH...

12:36.380 --> 12:38.757
ALIVE.

12:41.302 --> 12:45.556
- OKAY, SO TODAY WE'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT TRAGEDIES.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.684
- THIS IS WRONG.
THIS IS ALL WRONG.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.020
WHY ARE WE SITTING HERE
WHEN WE KNOW NINA'S MISSING?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.021
WE HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.022
- ROMEO AND JULIET.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.315
EVEN HOMER SIMPSON.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.860
THE TRAGEDY IS A TALE
THAT SEES OUR HERO COME UNSTUCK

12:57.943 --> 13:00.029
BECAUSE OF A FLAW
IN THEIR CHARACTER

13:00.112 --> 13:04.783
OR THEIR INABILITY TO DEAL
WITH WHAT LIFE THROWS AT THEM.

13:04.867 --> 13:10.164
SO OFTEN, OUR HERO OR HEROINE
COMES TO AN UNTIMELY END.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.249
- NOT THIS TIME, SHE DOESN'T!

13:12.333 --> 13:13.334
- WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

13:13.417 --> 13:13.959
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.461
[students murmur]

13:15.544 --> 13:16.837
- FABIAN.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.926
- I THINK FABIAN MIGHT BE HAVING
A HOLISTIC BREAKDOWN.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.302
- LOST IT TOTALLY.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.345
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:24.428 --> 13:25.429
- YEAH, YEAH, UM,

13:25.513 --> 13:27.723
HE'S JUST A BIT UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.604
- ALFIE, WHAT WAS THAT?

13:33.687 --> 13:36.023
- IT'S FINE.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.901
- OKAY, SO...

13:38.984 --> 13:40.069
- FABIAN, WAIT!

13:40.152 --> 13:41.237
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:41.320 --> 13:42.696
- I'M GOING TO TALK
TO MR. SWEET.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.198
LOOK, WE HAVE TO FIND HER,
DIG UP THE TUNNELS,

13:44.281 --> 13:45.783
WHATEVER IT TAKES!

13:45.866 --> 13:47.785
- YOU'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.
- I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT IS!

13:47.868 --> 13:48.536
WE CAN'T JUST
LEAVE HER DOWN THERE!

13:48.619 --> 13:51.330
[knocks on door]
- ENTER.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.838
- HELLO?

14:04.802 --> 14:07.513
MR. RODENMAAR?

14:07.596 --> 14:09.598
- WELL, I'M SORRY.
THAT'S JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

14:09.682 --> 14:10.891
- MR. SWEET, CAN I TALK--

14:10.975 --> 14:13.269
- I'M SORRY, FABIAN.
I NEED FIVE MINUTES.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.272
I HAVE A FISH CRISIS
IN THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA!

14:18.941 --> 14:20.234
- FABIAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

14:20.317 --> 14:23.445
YOU COULD BE PUTTING NINA'S LIFE
INTO EVEN MORE DANGER

14:23.529 --> 14:25.364
IF YOU GET A GROWN-UP INVOLVED.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.491
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.868
WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE, AMBER?
- HELLO?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
- IF I KNEW
SHE WAS DEFINITELY ALIVE,

14:31.662 --> 14:32.913
THEN MAYBE WE--
- HELLO?

14:32.997 --> 14:37.293
I'M DOWN HERE!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.586
- IT'S NINA.

14:38.669 --> 14:39.628
IT'S NINA!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.880
- I'M HERE!
I'M DOWN HERE!

14:41.964 --> 14:43.966
- SHE'S IN THE SUIT OF ARMOR?

14:44.049 --> 14:44.967
- HELLO?

14:45.050 --> 14:47.136
- WAIT.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.512
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14:48.596 --> 14:50.723
- AMBER, THE SOUND'S COMING
FROM DOWN HERE.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.600
- HELLO?
- NINA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14:52.683 --> 14:53.851
- YES!

14:53.934 --> 14:54.977
- SHE--SHE'S OKAY.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.938
- IT'S HER!
SHE'S OKAY!

14:58.022 --> 14:58.856
- NINA!

14:58.939 --> 15:00.316
- NINA, WHERE ARE YOU?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.359
- NINA, I'M GONNA GET YOU
BACK OUT OF THERE, OKAY?

15:02.443 --> 15:03.277
I PROMISE!

15:03.360 --> 15:04.987
- WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.072
- UM...
UM...

15:07.156 --> 15:08.866
I--I DROPPED A COIN.
I THINK IT ROLLED.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.201
- WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO SEE ME ABOUT?

15:11.285 --> 15:13.078
- ARE YOU STILL THERE?

15:13.162 --> 15:16.874
- WHAT WAS THAT?

15:16.957 --> 15:17.875
- HELLO?

15:17.958 --> 15:18.709
- QUIET!

15:18.792 --> 15:22.546
QUIET A FUNNY STORY, ACTUALLY!

15:22.630 --> 15:23.631
[laughs]

15:23.714 --> 15:25.174
- FABIAN, ARE YOU
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.300
- [whimpers]

15:26.383 --> 15:27.676
- UM, HE'S SUFFERING
FROM STRESS.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.011
UM, HE NEEDS TO LIE DOWN.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.972
THE NURSE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.
DON'T WORRY.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.182
- DO YOU THINK--

15:33.265 --> 15:34.308
DO--DO YOU THINK SHE HEARD?

15:34.391 --> 15:35.601
- I THINK EVERYBODY HEARD.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.693
[phone rings]

15:47.863 --> 15:49.907
- [sighs]

15:49.990 --> 15:51.950
- YOU'VE GONE VERY QUIET
ON ME LATELY, VERA.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.745
HAVE YOU FOUND ME
THE REAL MASK YET?

15:54.828 --> 15:56.872
- WE ARE GETTING CLOSER.

15:56.955 --> 15:58.123
- AH.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.709
AND VICTOR STILL THINKS
YOU'RE ON HIS SIDE?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.003
- YES.
- GOOD.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.382
JUST AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.508
YOU GET ME THE MASK,
AND YOU'LL BE REWARDED.

16:07.591 --> 16:09.718
- AND IF I FAIL?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.221
- FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.348
- FAIL?

16:14.431 --> 16:17.017
- UH, VERY WELL.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.394
WELL, I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT,
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.813
BYE.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.192
- WHO WAS THAT?

16:25.275 --> 16:29.738
- UH, THE ORGANIZER
OF A NATIONAL BAKE-OFF.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.740
THEY WANT ME TO ENTER MY FAMOUS
CHOCOLATE NIGHTMARE CAKE,

16:31.824 --> 16:34.743
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.996
I WORRY ABOUT FAILURE, VICTOR.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.331
- AS DO I, VERA.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.126
AS DO I.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.587
I WORRY THAT I WILL FAIL
TO PROTECT YOU

16:45.671 --> 16:49.007
FROM THIS SPIRIT
THAT IS SEEKING THE MASK,

16:49.091 --> 16:54.304
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE DECIDED
THAT YOU SHOULD MOVE OUT.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.773
- OH, UH, THANKS,

17:05.858 --> 17:06.942
BUT IF I'D WANTED CHEESE,

17:07.025 --> 17:08.819
I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE ORDERED CHEESE.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.319
- [sniffs]
OH.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.030
- [chuckles]
AND YOU STILL CLEARLY HATE TUNA.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.410
- NO, NO, I COULD TOTALLY
GET USED TO IT.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.078
PLUS, IT'S GOOD TO SHARE, RIGHT?

17:18.162 --> 17:22.207
IT'S WHAT COUPLES DO,
ISN'T IT?

17:22.290 --> 17:25.002
- OH, SUB THIEF.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.462
- UH, PATRICIA, A WORD?

17:26.545 --> 17:29.840
- LIKE, NOW.
- MM-HMM.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.301
- LATERS, FISH FACE.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.636
- [chuckles]
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

17:36.805 --> 17:40.934
SO, UM, TAKING SOME TIME OFF
FROM TAILING MARA?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.644
GOOD FOR YOU.
[chuckles]

17:42.728 --> 17:44.229
- DUDE, I NEVER TAILED MARA.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.774
WE JUST OFTEN END UP
IN THE SAME PLACE,

17:46.857 --> 17:49.109
THAT'S ALL.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.111
AT THE SAME TIME, EXACTLY.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.821
- YEAH.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.657
WHERE IS SHE, ANYWAY?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.910
- PROBABLY OFF REPORTING
SOMETHING SOMEWHERE.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.828
THAT IS ALL SHE DOES
SINCE JOY ENTERED HER

17:59.912 --> 18:01.413
IN THE BLOGGER COMPETITION.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.836
WHAT'S UP?

18:07.920 --> 18:13.842
- DUDE, JOY DIDN'T ENTER MARA.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.219
JOY ENTERED JOY.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.016
- MY MIND IS MADE UP, VERA.

18:21.099 --> 18:22.142
YOU ARE THE ONE WITH THE MARK.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.769
YOU ARE THE ONE
SHE WILL TRY TO HARM.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.230
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
OH, VICTOR.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.065
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME AWAY!

18:28.148 --> 18:30.192
- I AM NOT SENDING YOU AWAY,
MY DEAR.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.445
I AM SIMPLY TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.697
ONCE I HAVE THE MASK
AND THE TEARS OF GOLD,

18:35.781 --> 18:37.950
THE ELIXIR SHALL BE OURS,

18:38.033 --> 18:40.285
AND THEN WE SHALL
BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.496
- OH, BUT--
- SHH.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.373
WE MUST TRY TO BE STRONG,
MY DEAR.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.625
- [sobs]

18:47.501 --> 18:51.338
[sighs]

18:52.798 --> 18:54.716
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T FEEL READY.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.593
- NO, NO, THAT WAS BEFORE.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.011
NOW I KNOW SHE'S SAFE AND WELL,

18:58.095 --> 18:59.429
WE HAVE TO DO THIS THING
AND GET HER HOME.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.765
- TRUDY, I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.350
- NO.
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.103
I'VE BEEN HAVING
THESE FLASHBACKS AND DREAMS,

19:06.186 --> 19:08.564
AND, WELL, IF A THERAPIST
COULD HELP WITH ANY OF THAT--

19:08.647 --> 19:10.482
- UM, SORRY, WE HOPED--

19:10.566 --> 19:13.318
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE CLOSING
FOR LUNCH ROUND ABOUT NOW?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.404
- I'M TRYING
TO DISSUADE TRUDY HERE

19:15.487 --> 19:16.864
FROM CALLING IN A THERAPIST.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.574
- A THERAPIST?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.117
- TO HELP ME REGAIN MY MEMORY.

19:20.200 --> 19:20.909
- ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA, TRUDY?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.370
- EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.413
- YES, I DO,
AND THERE ARE

19:24.496 --> 19:26.707
FULLY-QUALIFIED THERAPISTS
OUT THERE

19:26.790 --> 19:28.083
THAT CAN HELP
WITH THIS KIND OF THING.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.960
I'M GOING TO GO
MAKE A FEW CALLS.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.880
- UH, TRUDY, WAIT.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.049
- IF TRUDY GETS HER MEMORY BACK,

19:36.133 --> 19:37.926
IT'S GONNA BE A WORLD
OF AWKWARD.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.761
- LOOK, LET'S WORRY
ABOUT THAT LATER, SHALL WE?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.471
COME ON, WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME TO DO THIS.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.182
[door creaks open]

19:44.266 --> 19:45.267
- [coughs]

19:45.350 --> 19:47.394
[magical whooshing]

19:53.025 --> 19:56.612
- I THOUGHT THEY DRUGGED YOU.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.782
- SOME PEOPLE
HAVE THE GIFT TO SEE,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.911
AND OTHERS NOT.

20:03.994 --> 20:09.374
YOUR GIFT IS GREAT,
I CAN...

20:09.458 --> 20:10.375
SENSE.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.543
- YEAH.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.463
SO GREAT, I ENDED UP
GETTING BENCHED HERE.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.882
SO...

20:16.965 --> 20:19.968
YOU'RE A GHOST, RIGHT?

20:22.054 --> 20:25.474
HOW DID YOU END UP DOWN HERE?

20:25.557 --> 20:28.560
- I SOUGHT THE POWER
OF THE MASK,

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
BUT ROBERT
WAS TOO CLEVER FOR ME,

20:29.811 --> 20:35.025
AND MY OWN SON WAS TOO STUPID
TO FIND ME.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.653
NOBODY CAME.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.530
I WAS LEFT HERE TO ROT!

20:40.614 --> 20:42.616
- MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA
GET ME OUT.

20:42.699 --> 20:46.870
- FOR YOUR SAKE,
I HOPE THEY DO.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.414
- NO, WAIT!

20:49.498 --> 20:51.458
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
ABOUT THE POWER OF THE MASK?

20:55.837 --> 20:58.840
COME ON, FABIAN!

20:58.924 --> 21:02.135
I NEED YOU.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.513
- OKAY, SO, AMBER,
ONE SQUARE FORWARD.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.849
PATRICIA, ONE SQUARE FORWARD.
ALFIE, ONE SQUARE FORWARD.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.101
- DUDE, STAY IN YOUR SQUARE.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.560
WHAT IF THE CREEPY DOG FACE
POINTS AT ME?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.229
- NO, I'VE BEEN WATCHING HIM.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.190
I THINK HE'S GONNA POINT
THE OTHER WAY ON HIS NEXT MOVE.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.401
BESIDES, IT MEANS MORE PROGRESS
FOR NINA.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.280
[air hissing]

21:25.742 --> 21:28.870
- ANUBIS DUDE'S NOT MOVING.

21:28.954 --> 21:29.997
- WE'RE ONE PLAYER LESS,

21:30.080 --> 21:31.039
SO THAT MEANS ONE OF YOU
GETS AN EXTRA MOVE.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.167
UM, ALFIE, YOU TAKE IT.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.177
