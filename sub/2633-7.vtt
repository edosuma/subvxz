WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.794
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

00:04.587 --> 00:07.006
- Hi. Rachel. Phoebe's.
- It's. And.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.507
- Please.
- Leave.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.092
Leave.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.344
But I just said "leave."

00:12.512 --> 00:15.639
Yeah, I know,
because you have all the good words.

00:15.807 --> 00:20.477
What do I get? I get "it's, and."
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.689
- Come on, that's silly.
- All right. So let's switch.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.567
No, I have all the good words.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.736
Okay, fine, fine. We can switch.

00:28.903 --> 00:30.821
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.948
- Hi.
- Everybody.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.241
- It's.
- Rachel.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.492
- And.
- Phoebe's.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.619
Pleas... Wait. How did you do that?

00:37.787 --> 00:39.204
What?

00:40.081 --> 00:42.958
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

00:44.044 --> 00:47.713
Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later?
I wanna go running before it gets dark.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.923
- Why don't you come with me?
- Really?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.258
Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.387
We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first,
you know, roommate-bonding thing.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.056
Okay, let's go running!

00:57.223 --> 00:59.725
- Yeah, and there's cute guys there.
- Let's run towards them!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.351
Okay.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.520
Wait just one more second.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.398
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

01:06.983 --> 01:09.443
Now, wait a minute.
You just took all the words.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.279
Uh-huh. You've met your match,
Rachel Green.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.989
- So I just finished this fascinating book.
- Hmm.

01:56.157 --> 01:59.493
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers...

01:59.661 --> 02:04.706
...that can carry out the same amount
of functions as an actual human brain.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.042
So, theoretically,
you could download...

02:07.210 --> 02:10.753
...your thoughts and memories
into this computer...

02:10.922 --> 02:15.843
...and live forever as a machine.

02:19.347 --> 02:23.183
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.687
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:27.272 --> 02:31.024
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.530
- I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
- Oh, so you can move them.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.031
Yes.

02:38.199 --> 02:41.952
Yes, and while I'm doing that,
Ross has a great computer story for you.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.832
Hey, everybody.
Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.626
She's gonna be my new roommate.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.338
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.382
And she's gonna live with me!

02:57.468 --> 02:59.303
It's nice to meet you. Janine?

02:59.470 --> 03:00.804
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.765
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.643
So, uh, where are you from?

03:06.811 --> 03:08.979
Australia. I just moved here
a couple of weeks ago.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.689
- From the land down under?
- Yeah.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.858
I didn't know that either.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.694
So, what do you do?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.780
- I'm a dancer.
- You're a dancer?

03:18.948 --> 03:21.491
She's a dancer.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.330
- Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
- Here, let me...

03:33.922 --> 03:36.089
- Joey?
- Yeah?

03:36.841 --> 03:39.551
Did you even interview this woman
before you asked her to move in?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.470
- Of course I did.
- Uh-huh.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.013
What exactly did you ask her?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.973
When can you move in?

03:47.518 --> 03:50.479
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.148
Unbelievable.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.609
Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.819
Hey, look at all the boxes.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.740
I cannot wait to ask her out.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.076
Wait a minute, Joey.
Joey, you can't ask her out.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.954
She's your roommate.
It'll be way too complicated.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.580
Yeah, man, don't do it.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.542
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.838
Think about it. Remember when you were
going out with Donna and you broke up...

04:17.005 --> 04:20.216
...remember how horrible it was when
you bumped into her at the supermarket?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.843
Oh, God, yeah.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.680
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.348
Okay.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.268
- No, no.
- Oh. Oh.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.646
You're right. I don't want that.
I can't date her.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.774
And you'd better watch the flirting too,
because in close quarters...

04:35.942 --> 04:38.652
...it could be trouble.
- Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.572
I mean, it's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.743
Heh. Well, you're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.080
A little sad about that, sweetie?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.754
I have to tie my shoes,
so you go ahead. I'll catch up.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.756
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.763
Come on, that's not running.
Let's go!

05:12.562 --> 05:14.771
You guys, I'm telling you,
when she runs...

05:14.939 --> 05:17.274
...she looks like a cross
between Kermit the Frog...

05:17.442 --> 05:19.401
...and the Six Million Dollar Man.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.281
Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.910
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.287
I used to do that too.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.915
Oh, my God. Did you also have his album,
It's Not Easy Being Green?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.086
Oh, Mon.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.965
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

05:42.133 --> 05:45.052
Yeah. And you know what?
And I know she's gonna want to run again.

05:45.219 --> 05:48.013
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

05:48.389 --> 05:51.516
Why don't you just be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.062
You're right. You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.396
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:56.564 --> 06:00.525
Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me.
I don't think I can ever run again, ever.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.196
Why? Why would you do that?

06:04.655 --> 06:06.323
I don't know.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.493
Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.245
- Ankle.
- We'll see.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.336
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.463
Thanks for helping me, man.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.173
Joe?

06:29.597 --> 06:32.015
Well, I guess Joey went home.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.478
Oh, and look, there is still one box
that I have to unpack.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.941
I got you.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.279
Oh, my God,
you almost gave me a heart attack.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.200
It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.494
Hey, the place looks great.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.829
Yeah, not bad, right?

06:53.996 --> 06:57.833
You know what? Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.043
You know what else I'm gonna do?

07:00.211 --> 07:03.088
I'm gonna go downstairs,
I'm gonna get her some flowers.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.965
Now, who would not want
to live with me?

07:05.466 --> 07:06.925
I don't.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.971
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.182
How's that going, though?
Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.476
Yeah, so far. Yeah.
But it's tough, you know?

07:16.644 --> 07:20.522
I've got all this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.318
How you doing?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.867
Oh, man.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.953
Sorry. There's just more room out here.

07:35.121 --> 07:41.460
Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.509
- Why don't you try to be?
- Aah!

07:50.052 --> 07:51.678
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.930
I just... I didn't want you to touch me...

07:54.098 --> 07:57.267
...because I'm all sweaty
from the workout. Ha, ha.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.768
I'm gonna hit the shower.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.523
Oh, my God.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.692
Oh, sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.737
It's just my thongs are too delicate
for the dryer.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.833
- Aah!
- Hi.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.418
Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.880
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.257
You lied so you could run by yourself.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.134
No, Phoebe, no. I was... No.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.470
I was actually just checking...

08:33.638 --> 08:34.804
...to see...

08:34.972 --> 08:36.722
...if I could run. And I can.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.642
Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.

08:38.808 --> 08:39.934
No, wait. Phoebe?

08:52.657 --> 08:55.575
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.287
So, Mondler...

08:59.664 --> 09:01.039
Uh...

09:02.166 --> 09:04.876
What, uh...? What are you doing?

09:05.044 --> 09:07.295
What does it look like? I am cleaning.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.799
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all of her stuff?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.635
Authorizat... I don't need that.
I'm gonna put everything back.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.096
Put it back exactly where you found it?

09:16.264 --> 09:19.474
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.978
Okay, first of all,
that attitude is not helping.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.064
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.651
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

09:30.736 --> 09:33.154
She's gonna recognize
that I did a nice thing...

09:33.322 --> 09:35.615
...and appreciate it.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.368
Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.662
Because when you have to move back
with Joey...

09:40.830 --> 09:43.623
...Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.876
Oh, I see, I see.
You're trying to freak me out.

09:47.044 --> 09:51.673
Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

09:51.841 --> 09:56.636
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years.
She's going to freak out.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.598
Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.559
No, she is not, okay?
I'll prove it to you.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.728
I'm gonna call her right now.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.439
Phone's done.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.568
- Hi.
- Hey, Mon. How's it going?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.904
Terrible. If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.823
Other people just wreck stuff.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.952
I really think
I might kill someone tonight.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.582
Oh, come on, come on,
it can't be that bad.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.751
It's worse.
The only thing getting me through...

10:27.918 --> 10:29.628
...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.964
- I might get out of here early.
- No. No, no, no.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.175
No, no, it sounds like
they need you there.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.928
- You're just hanging out with Ross?
- It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.223
She's gonna kill me.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.435
The phone was facing the other way.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.188
And that goes back up there.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.444
Know what we should do?
We should start with the big stuff.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.114
That'll be the easiest.
So, uh, let's start with the couch.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.950
I got it.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.373
Yeah, that doesn't look right.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.751
What are you talking about? The couch
is perfectly in line with the carpet.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.464
Then I can just walk over here
and casually just put my feet right up on...

11:15.633 --> 11:16.800
Okay, here's what we do.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.886
We just move the couch closer
to the coffee table.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.139
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the back of the carpet.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.476
Okay, well, here,
we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...

11:26.644 --> 11:27.686
...closer to the couch.

11:27.853 --> 11:33.775
No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.362
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table... Ross.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.617
Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?

11:42.785 --> 11:47.038
I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.879
What the hell's going on over here?

11:56.507 --> 11:57.841
Monica's gonna kill you.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.802
Look, I need your help, okay?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.681
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.683
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.685
You guys repel women all the time.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.106
Hey, I've been married three times.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.196
No, no, no, I've seen it happen.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.075
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.703
What's your secret?

12:28.330 --> 12:30.498
Look, we do not repel women, okay?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.584
That is completely untrue.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.712
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.298
Remember back in college
when we went to that dance...

12:38.466 --> 12:41.718
...and you walked right up to that girl
you liked and couldn't stop talking...

12:41.886 --> 12:44.137
...about the Irish potato famine?

12:45.222 --> 12:48.308
Yeah, well, what about you?
You weren't so hot in college either.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.893
After everything he said, he'd go:

12:53.439 --> 12:56.649
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either.
Maybe I should stop doing that.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.737
You know what? Girls don't like it
when I start talking about science.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.198
That's not specific to girls.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.868
This is great. This is great. What else?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.037
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.582
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.962
You know, they don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.592
- Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
- I'm never gonna find love again.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.972
Hey.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.600
- Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.187
Okay. Um, I...

13:36.273 --> 13:39.484
Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry, okay?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.111
I handled the situation horribly.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.447
And I should not have lied to you.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.367
So what should you have done?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.828
Well, I should have told you the truth.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.372
Uh-huh. Which is?

13:52.957 --> 13:58.211
Well, you know, the reason that
I didn't want to go running with you is...

13:58.379 --> 13:59.921
...because, um...

14:00.089 --> 14:03.132
...well, you know, the way that you run
is just a little...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.345
- So?
- Well, it's embarrassing.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.556
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.809
- Why do you care?
- Because they're people.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.854
But people that you don't know
and will never see again.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.314
Yes, but still they are people...

14:18.482 --> 14:20.316
...with eyes.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.778
Well, I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss:

14:23.946 --> 14:26.197
Choo, choo, choo, choo.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.867
But, oh, okay.

14:29.034 --> 14:33.204
No, no, I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.206
Yeah, okay. You're uptight.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.836
What? I am not uptight. Whoa.

14:40.004 --> 14:44.591
Listen, I am not uptight, man.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.262
That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.099
Me, I'm more free, you know?
I run like I did when I was a kid...

14:53.267 --> 14:56.019
...because that's the only way it's fun,
you know?

14:56.186 --> 14:59.522
I mean, didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off...

14:59.690 --> 15:02.191
...you know, like, when you were
running towards the swings...

15:02.359 --> 15:04.986
...or running away from Satan?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.116
The neighbor's dog.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.914
Okay, is this lamp in the right place?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.708
Who cares? I repel women.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.379
No, no, no! You can't come in here.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.131
Ross is naked!

15:27.885 --> 15:29.886
- What?
- What?

15:30.721 --> 15:34.015
I couldn't say that I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.559
Why does anyone have to be naked?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.230
Why is Ross naked?

15:43.442 --> 15:47.403
I had to show Chandler something.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.699
Naked?

15:52.618 --> 15:53.910
Yeah, I uh...

15:54.078 --> 15:56.079
I guess I have, a, uh...

15:56.580 --> 15:58.373
A guy problem.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.086
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.674
Look, just come back later.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.301
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.678
Okay. Hey, listen.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.431
There's still some of Chandler's medicine
left under the sink in the bathroom.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.101
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.233
Thank God.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.571
Dude, what'd you have?

16:32.074 --> 16:34.784
Look, we have no time, okay?
We must focus.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.745
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.038
The photo album.

16:39.206 --> 16:43.126
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.920
We just go through it
and match everything to the pictures.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.798
- That's perfect. That's brilliant.
- Yeah.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.386
So really, what did you have?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.932
Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.687
Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?

17:04.314 --> 17:05.857
Sure.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.318
Listen, I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.738
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.367
Is there something wrong?

17:18.912 --> 17:20.663
All right, all right.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.833
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?

17:24.001 --> 17:25.501
You're hot.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.212
I'm lovable.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.382
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.843
But we're roommates...

17:34.011 --> 17:37.597
...and it's a huge mistake for us
to continue down this road.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.515
- Joey...
- No, no, no. I'm telling you.

17:39.683 --> 17:43.061
Imagine yourself living in a supermarket
and you'll understand.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.941
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

17:49.109 --> 17:51.235
Well, I don't think
there is anything to do.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.654
I mean, I think you're really sweet.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.324
But I'm just not interested
in you like that.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.580
Oh.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.665
No, I mean...

18:05.459 --> 18:10.505
You're a really nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.632
I'm just, you know, I just...

18:12.800 --> 18:16.010
...don't feel that way about you.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.221
Oh.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.307
I see what happened. Ha, ha.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.935
It's because I was trying to repel you.

18:24.103 --> 18:29.190
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.568
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.657
How you doing?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.202
I'm okay.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.706
What?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.126
Oh, dear God.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.092
Choo, choo, choo.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.396
- Hey!
- Hi!

19:09.857 --> 19:12.400
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.610
See? And you don't care
if people are staring.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.446
It's just for a second,
because then you're gone.

19:17.614 --> 19:21.117
It's amazing, Pheebs.
I feel so free and so graceful.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.577
Oh!

19:25.706 --> 19:27.957
Ha! Hey, look out for the horse.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.208
Sorry.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.966
Is it okay for me to come in now?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.676
Uh-huh.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.727
- Why is everything different?
- Bye.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.106
I don't see anything different...

19:52.274 --> 19:55.693
...other than the fact that the room got
so much brighter when you came into it.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.489
Well, the end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre...

20:00.657 --> 20:03.117
...and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.163
Okay, look, don't be mad, okay?

20:07.331 --> 20:11.834
But after I unpacked the boxes,
I wanted to do something nice for you...

20:12.002 --> 20:14.921
...so I cleaned the apartment.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.840
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot...

20:18.008 --> 20:22.595
...where it went back. And I'm sorry,
I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.598
That's okay.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.351
Chandler, are you afraid of me
or something?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.187
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

20:32.439 --> 20:34.482
Of course not.

20:34.775 --> 20:38.027
My gosh, Chandler,
what you did is a wonderful thing...

20:38.195 --> 20:39.946
...and I really appreciate it.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.699
I know I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.285
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.162
Really?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.706
Of course.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.875
Oh, you're the best.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.669
You come here to me.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.964
Hold on, okay? First things first.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.757
Okay. Now...

20:59.925 --> 21:02.677
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.850
So it said that by the year 2030...

21:10.018 --> 21:13.271
...there will be computers carrying
out the same number of functions...

21:13.438 --> 21:15.564
...as an actual human brain.

21:15.732 --> 21:19.235
So theoretically, you could
download your thoughts...

21:19.403 --> 21:21.612
...and your memories
into this computer...

21:21.780 --> 21:24.198
And live forever as a machine.

21:27.286 --> 21:32.164
Uh, so, Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

21:33.583 --> 21:36.085
You and I, we're interfacing.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.297
Yeah. I gotta go.
