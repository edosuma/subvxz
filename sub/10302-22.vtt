Next up
on the Home Shopping Network...

01:53.880 --> 01:57.316
..."Boyfriends of Cher
Collector Plates."

02:00.480 --> 02:03.119
Who'd wanna eat off
of Gregg Allman?

02:18.800 --> 02:20.995
You won't believe
what they're doing at the mall.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.076
Putting a sign in front of the shoe store
that says, "Over two pairs sold"?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.238
That hurts, Peg.

02:29.480 --> 02:33.519
Not as much as seeing you first thing
in the morning, but that still hurts.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.158
Anyway, they're making us
all car pool.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.790
Damn, this cleaner, greener
Chicago program.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.952
Do you realize that they even want us
to conserve water?

02:44.200 --> 02:48.716
Well, did you tell them about
how much water you save on showers?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.038
I did.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.633
You know, this conservation crap
has gone a little too far.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.759
What did we take this country from the
Indians for if we're not gonna use it?

02:59.760 --> 03:02.274
Do you know the kind of people
that are doing this, Peg?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.272
People who won't chop
down one tree...

03:10.480 --> 03:13.677
...but mow their heads
are the kind of people behind this.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.438
Al Bundy, why would you leave
that landfill you call a car running...

03:18.680 --> 03:20.079
...after you come home?

03:20.320 --> 03:23.232
I didn't. It just takes a while to stop.

03:25.960 --> 03:29.509
I mean, when you cut a chicken's
head off it still runs around the room.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.631
There. It's off.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.313
Well, it's cars like yours that make
car pooling necessary...

03:40.560 --> 03:44.075
...which is why I'm glad my bank is one
of the cleaner, greener sponsors.

03:44.320 --> 03:48.836
Marcie, it is a man's God-given right
to drive alone in his car.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.275
A man's car is his castle.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.829
Well, I thought a man's home
was his castle.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.231
It is, if he can slay the dragon
that's living there.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.480
Besides, too many people
in one car spells trouble.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.511
What do we do
when someone cuts us off?

04:04.720 --> 04:07.188
Are we all supposed
to give him the finger?

04:08.440 --> 04:12.479
No, just whichever one of you
can get it out of his nose first.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.709
A man's nose is also his castle.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.159
In my America, a man's car
and his nose is his castle.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.039
Well, in my America...

04:24.280 --> 04:25.679
...there's one giant bus...

04:25.920 --> 04:29.629
...that the whole world gets on
to ride to work together.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.590
And on this bus I greet people
from different lands...

04:34.920 --> 04:37.957
...each in their own native language.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.516
You're talking about the city bus.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.910
Well, I can see this is certainly falling
on a pair of deaf and furry ears.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.630
Well! This car pool outrage
will not go unchallenged.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.714
You wanna get something cleaner
and greener? Wash my underwear!

05:05.640 --> 05:07.995
Hey, wait a second,
that was a shot at me.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.557
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it can be from me.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.433
Peg, remember the time
when a man could burn a tank of gas...

05:15.680 --> 05:17.875
...backing out of his own driveway?

05:18.080 --> 05:22.596
A man took a hooker to a steak house
and no one would even blink an eye?

05:23.240 --> 05:26.118
Peg, why can't we go back
to simpler times?

05:26.680 --> 05:29.035
Al, but look at this place.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.272
Any simpler and we'd be bushmen.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.437
You know who I really feel for,
don't you? The kids.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.232
What's the point in being young...

05:38.440 --> 05:41.238
...if you can't get in a big old car
with a really dumb girl?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.033
Dad...

05:49.040 --> 05:52.396
...I got straight A's
and made the dean's list.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.917
Son, I wish you could have been
alive back when I was.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.033
Of course, I probably wouldn't
have let you hang out with me...

05:59.440 --> 06:03.319
...back when a time when a man could
be a man and a car could be a car.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.472
When we had one hand on the wheel
and one hand on the girl...

06:06.720 --> 06:08.676
...and one hand on the stick.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.153
That's what I liked about the old days.
We...

06:12.680 --> 06:14.511
...had more hands.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.876
Mom, I made the dean's list.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.236
Oh, and I'm very proud of you.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.799
Now tell me, honey...

06:25.040 --> 06:27.395
...who is this dean?

06:28.360 --> 06:30.590
Is he a nice boy?

06:32.480 --> 06:34.232
Mom. Dad.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.632
I am getting a raise
at the extermination company.

06:47.760 --> 06:51.230
I was also voted
Employee of the Month.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.398
So Pest Boys will hold an awards
ceremony for me in a few weeks.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.670
- Oh, I gotta go tell my friends.
- Oh, honey.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.549
They might even put my name
on the golden fly swatter.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.596
Oh, Al. Our little girl is all grown-up.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.469
Kind of puts this dean's thing
in perspective, don't it?

07:13.680 --> 07:16.592
Kind of puts my genetic makeup
in perspective.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.718
Listen to that, Peg.
Now he's using makeup.

07:20.960 --> 07:24.748
First this dean thing and now this.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.149
Now look what you've done! You get
out of here! You've upset your mother!

07:33.320 --> 07:35.550
Don't answer it, Peg.
He's from the mall.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.360
They're coming to tell me
who I have to car pool with.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.273
As far as I'm concerned,
they can rot out there.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.756
Come in.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.275
Or they can rot in here with me.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.438
Hi.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.633
Are you Al Bundy?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.595
Why, yes, I am.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.995
Oh, and that's my...
My... My housekeeper, Consuela.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.516
Oh, Consuela, upstairs-oh.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.553
I'm his wife.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.439
It's a marriage of convenience.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.752
Unfortunately not mine.
I'm deporting her.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.670
Can I get you a drink
or a condominium?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.753
No, thanks, Mr. Bundy.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.433
My name is Naomi
and I'm with Victoria's Secret.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.875
Oh, I love your work.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.876
I know. I've seen
your face prints on the window.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.398
The mall sent me over here to ask you
if you would join us in our car pool.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.398
I'm in.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.550
Let's go. Adios, Consuela!

08:52.360 --> 08:55.796
Actually, I'm not driving, but several
of our models do live in the area.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.712
They do?

08:58.320 --> 09:00.390
Oh, Consuela...

09:02.240 --> 09:05.789
...we live model adjacent.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.796
Blot your chin...

09:09.080 --> 09:11.071
...and your pants.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.357
So when do my models
come to get me?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.672
- Seven a.m.
- Good, I don't have to be there till 10...

09:18.880 --> 09:25.149
...which gives me a lot of time for
coffee, cartwheels and a cold shower.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.832
He's just kidding about the shower.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.236
- Here are your models' names.
- Why, thank you.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.755
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.548
Alexis, Monique and Paulina.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.832
Oh, my.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.559
Alexis, Monique and Paulina.
Oh, my.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.712
Alexis, Monique and Paulina.
Oh, my.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.634
Alexis, Monique and Paulina.
Oh, my.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.354
So they tell me you girls are models
for Victoria's Secret.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.828
Oh, we are.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.072
We're Victoria's big secret.

10:24.360 --> 10:28.638
Well, Victoria couldn't keep
a secret this big.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.880
It's a new line of lingerie
for the full-figured woman...

10:33.080 --> 10:36.993
...because you know what they say.
"You're never too big to be sexy."

10:37.520 --> 10:40.080
Oh, and do you know who says that?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.077
Fat girls.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.555
So do you always go to work wearing
a suit and smelling of High Karate?

10:51.200 --> 10:55.478
No. Do you always go to work wearing
curtains and smelling of Mars Bars?

10:58.760 --> 11:01.479
Sounds to me like you're full
of self-hate, Mr. Bundy.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.474
Well, at least I'm full.

11:05.560 --> 11:10.111
Would you mind turning on the radio,
I feel a crying jag coming on.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.675
Say please.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.514
There's a Chunky in it for you.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.711
Oh, I love this song.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.394
It reminds me of that summer
in Hawaii with Tony.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.153
God, what a lover.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.637
Oh, man, he could do it
all night long.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.994
Did I ever tell you about that time
me and Johnny Klog...

11:35.240 --> 11:37.276
...joined the mile-high club?

11:37.520 --> 11:41.115
I was wearing this frilly little skirt
and not much underneath.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.794
- Well...
- Pull over!

11:47.960 --> 11:51.669
- What?
- Pull over, I've gotta heave.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.279
Shut up, or I'll pound you like
a scaloppini.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.715
We're almost there.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.951
The police. What did we do?

12:04.200 --> 12:07.476
Well, I don't know.
Maybe we missed the truck scale.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.193
But on the positive side...

12:16.440 --> 12:20.228
...maybe they'll get me out of here
before I turn into a diamond.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.672
- What seems to be the problem?
- Hi, I'm Alderman Johnson.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.754
- Would you four be car pooling?
- No, I'm their lunch.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.714
- What's up?
- Well, we were following you...

12:32.960 --> 12:35.918
...and laughing and pointing.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.628
And as it turns out,
despite our best efforts...

12:38.880 --> 12:42.589
...you're the only people car pooling
in all of Chicago.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.355
We're also the only people eating
snickerdoodles by the gallon.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.912
Well, we'd like you and your friends
to represent the city...

12:50.160 --> 12:53.630
...in its new media campaign,
"Everybody into the car pool."

12:53.880 --> 12:56.553
Forget it. You got the wrong guy.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.230
Well, that's too bad, because your
first promotional appearance...

13:00.440 --> 13:04.115
...would have been courtside
at the Chicago Bulls playoff game.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.555
Say cheesecake.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.270
Oh, here comes your daddy.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.671
Hi, I'm Al Bundy...

13:26.920 --> 13:29.514
...but many of you know me as...

13:30.080 --> 13:31.911
...AI Bundy.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.676
There was a time I scored four
touchdowns in one game on this field...

13:35.880 --> 13:37.757
...but now I can't run four feet...

13:38.000 --> 13:40.468
...without being tackled
by someone else's garbage.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.274
Be a part of my team.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.837
Two, four, six, eight
Pick up litter, clean your plate

13:52.080 --> 13:56.119
Yay, Keep Chicago Clean!

14:02.240 --> 14:04.834
Score a touchdown for mother earth.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.390
Let's help keep Chicago
green and clean.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.548
Please.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.036
What a load.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.392
Mom, isn't Dad being just
a tad hypocritical?

14:24.640 --> 14:28.679
That was the first time I've seen him
walk the field without taking a whiz.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.674
Since he's been on billboards
and the side of buses...

14:31.920 --> 14:34.639
...he has been an insufferable pig.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.236
Whoa, that was a big word.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.319
There are no big words,
just little heads.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.389
Now, kids, maybe we should give
your father the benefit of the doubt.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.959
Maybe he's learned something.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.953
Maybe he really does care
about the environment.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.113
I'm in the money
I'm in the money

15:07.160 --> 15:10.470
Did I tell you about the cutest thing
Paulina did at the mayor's office?

15:10.720 --> 15:14.190
We don't wanna hear
about your fat friends.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.234
They're not fat.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.438
They just eat way, way too much.

15:20.360 --> 15:24.433
I don't get it. Everyone in this town
loves what I'm doing but you guys.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.956
You swine.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.955
And our next-door McNugget.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.833
Do you realize...

15:35.080 --> 15:39.358
...that you have cost me
my job at the bank again?

15:39.600 --> 15:43.195
They have demoted me
to drive-up teller again!

15:43.440 --> 15:44.919
What happened?

15:45.200 --> 15:47.236
Al called the bank president
and asked:

15:47.480 --> 15:49.835
"How can you say
you're environmentally correct...

15:50.080 --> 15:54.153
...and yet have an employee who would
disconnect her car's smog device?"

15:54.400 --> 15:57.995
I'll have you know that
I religiously get my car tuned up...

15:58.240 --> 16:00.754
...and I will expose you
for the liar that you are!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.560
I will prove myself innocent
of these false allegations!

16:03.800 --> 16:05.518
My car is no gas-guzzler!

16:05.760 --> 16:07.990
- It is clean as a wh...
- Marcie...

16:09.480 --> 16:11.835
...I disconnected your smog device.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.918
Did you?

16:20.040 --> 16:23.510
If I maybe so patient as to ask why?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.677
I'm a guy.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.191
Well, just come with me...

16:31.440 --> 16:34.273
...and we can disconnect that too.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.672
Al, I told you that in the strictest
confidence. What're you doing?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.713
Blabbing.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.152
The smog device
can be put back on...

16:47.400 --> 16:49.709
...if you just give me your credit card.
Please!

16:50.360 --> 16:52.112
Man, I love this gig.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.635
I never realized
how much power I've got.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.793
But, Dad, if you don't
really believe in this ecology stuff...

16:58.040 --> 17:02.192
...then doesn't that make you
a lying bag of sleaze?

17:02.600 --> 17:07.469
Yes, son, but a rich
lying bag of sleaze.

17:09.079 --> 17:13.358
You see, we celebrities don't really
believe the stuff we're paid to say.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.670
- Well, then why do you do it?
- To make money.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.147
And get out of the house.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.756
That is the American dream,
and by God I'm living it!

17:21.000 --> 17:23.752
I'm so happy, I could almost cry.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.709
In fact, I am crying.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.790
My friends and I
are doing the right thing.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.359
Why?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.795
Because we're car pooling.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.911
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning, Al.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.355
When I'm off to work,
I'm not selfish...

17:47.600 --> 17:51.115
...because I drive to work with my...

17:51.880 --> 17:53.632
My friends.

17:54.320 --> 17:59.030
- How about some doughnut holes, Al?
- Thank you, Monique.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.073
That's enough.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.479
As you can see, when you have
a lot riding on your tires...

18:05.720 --> 18:09.235
...you help not only the environment,
but you mak e friends.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.077
And after a leisurely breakfast
of doughnut holes and sorghum...

18:13.320 --> 18:16.118
...you can sit back
and enjoy the ride.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.795
Mother Nature says, "Hey."

18:23.800 --> 18:26.678
Father Time says, "Yikes."

18:26.920 --> 18:30.993
Don't worry, you'll have your moment
when they start couch pooling.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.640
The girls are coming
to discuss next week's itinerary.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.519
Remember, no fat jokes.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.990
But they're fat.

18:40.840 --> 18:44.389
They're not fat.
They just have cream filling.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.079
Come in, ladies.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.276
Hi.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.034
- Got any munchies?
- Right over there.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.191
Come on in, everybody.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.670
I'll get some milk.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.393
Here.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.272
Al, wait'll you hear this.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.229
We've been invited to Los Angeles.
We're gonna be on Vicki.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.314
And do guest voices
on Captain Planet.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.955
I haven't been this happy since...

19:18.200 --> 19:21.078
You installed seats
in your refrigerator?

19:26.920 --> 19:29.957
Allow me to introduce my family.
This is my wife, Peggy...

19:30.200 --> 19:33.033
...this is my son, Shecky.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.748
Oh, Al, we're going to L.A.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.797
Just think of the things to see.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.838
Wendy's. Winchell's.
Der Weinerschnitzel.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.229
It's so exciting!

19:49.840 --> 19:51.478
Congratulations, Mr. Bundy.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.951
You and your gals have practically
put Chicago on the map.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.397
Hey, Chicago
was already on the map.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.396
- Do you vote?
- No.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.993
Then I wasn't talking to you.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.196
Now, before you go to L. A...

20:09.440 --> 20:11.715
...we'd like you to kick off
our new campaign...

20:11.960 --> 20:15.316
...by making a speech in front
of the most toxic plant in Chicago.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.394
We want you to tell the world
that our program is going nationwide...

20:19.640 --> 20:22.552
...that polluters like this
may soon no longer exist.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.988
What do you say?

20:24.240 --> 20:26.470
- Will there be shrimp?
- There will.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.831
We're there!

20:35.320 --> 20:36.833
Daddy.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.196
In here, pumpkin.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.468
Tomorrow I'm giving a speech and with
you getting employee of the month...

20:43.720 --> 20:47.998
...and Bud on the queen's list...
- That's dean's list.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.514
Yeah, like there's a difference.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.115
It's gonna be a banner day
for the Bundys.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.678
Well, that's just it, Dad.
I may not be employee of the month.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.798
See, tomorrow
a certain environmental group...

21:02.040 --> 21:04.508
...will speak
in front of the extermination company.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.035
And when they find out that
a certain spokesman...

21:07.280 --> 21:11.398
...is related to a certain verminator,
I'm gonna lose my job.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.269
Oh, no. I'm speaking
at a horrible toxic-waste plant.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.710
What the hell do you think we are?

21:17.960 --> 21:20.633
I mean, until last week
that's how we advertised.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.189
- But, pumpkin.
- Pumpkin?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.590
Pie? Where?

21:32.120 --> 21:35.157
Al, you know what you have to do.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.598
You are the greatest daddy
in the whole world.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.752
You gave up all your dreams for me.
Why?

21:55.000 --> 21:58.549
- Well, I l...
- Love me?

21:58.800 --> 22:02.076
No, pumpkin,
I was gonna say I lost my mind.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.394
So I don't get my 15 minutes of fame.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.473
That just means
Pauly Shore gets a half-hour.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.430
- He is funny, isn't he?
- No.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.868
But, pumpkin, my job as a parent
is not to be famous...

22:17.080 --> 22:18.638
...but to do the best that I can...

22:18.840 --> 22:21.991
...so that my children
can have the things I never did.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.196
The world I leave behind.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.557
That is my legacy to you.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.791
You first, sweetheart.
