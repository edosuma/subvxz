WEBVTT

01:36.389 --> 01:37.389
This is not good.

02:00.705 --> 02:01.705
I can't shake him!

02:04.500 --> 02:06.127
Sentry to the challenge!

02:09.797 --> 02:10.797
Corey, don't!

02:38.159 --> 02:40.161
Killer move, Corey.
How'd you peg it?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.871
Gotta go with your instincts.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.122
Good instincts.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.999
You just bagged the all-time high score.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.045
Yes!

02:49.128 --> 02:52.465
No fair! You must have
logged a gazillion hours on that game.

02:52.548 --> 02:53.924
Maybe more.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.469
But for the first time
I really felt it, ya know?

02:56.552 --> 02:58.012
Like I actually was

02:58.095 --> 03:00.348
a Sentry of the Last Cosmos.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.058
Hey, watch it!

03:02.641 --> 03:05.061
Or what? You gonna bop me
with a flamin' sword?

03:05.144 --> 03:06.228
Get a life.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.026
Jerk.

03:41.639 --> 03:44.141
Look, if we tweak these codes,

03:44.266 --> 03:46.602
we can design our own Sentry scenarios.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.831
Don't you ever think of anything else?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.523
I mean, there are other games.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.316
Yeah, right.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.735
Got mail?

04:01.075 --> 04:02.827
Oh, my God!

04:03.744 --> 04:04.744
What?

04:05.454 --> 04:07.289
It's from Simon Harper!

04:07.748 --> 04:10.209
The guy who created the Sentries?
No way!

04:10.292 --> 04:13.212
Yeah! The great Wise One, himself.

04:13.295 --> 04:16.507
He's like a god,
and he's inviting me to Sentrycroft.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.425
To where?

04:17.508 --> 04:20.719
His private estate.
Nobody goes there!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.351
So what's he want with you?

04:39.697 --> 04:41.991
<i>State name and mission.</i>

04:42.074 --> 04:43.200
Corey Cavalieri.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.828
I... I'm here to see Mr. Harper.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.094
I'm tellin' you,
it's the ship Aaron uses in game three

05:02.178 --> 05:03.178
to escape from Palothera.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.055
It totally is not. It's...

05:05.139 --> 05:07.057
The Galactic Glider.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.518
From game four, <i>The Secret Darkness.</i>

05:09.602 --> 05:12.646
Exactly! I mean, duh! What else?

05:12.730 --> 05:14.690
It was also in game five,

05:14.773 --> 05:17.443
modified for time travel
by the Wise One.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.570
Yeah! I, I knew that.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.877
I can't believe
I'm actually standing here.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.617
It's like a dream.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.701
I assure you,

05:25.784 --> 05:27.036
it's quite real.

05:29.205 --> 05:30.205
Mr. Harper.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.916
Hey, that's the robe of the Wise One!

05:31.999 --> 05:33.459
Dempsey, shut up!

05:33.542 --> 05:35.503
But he's quite right.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.796
This is the mantle
worn by all the initiated.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.715
What you call, "the Wise Ones."

05:39.798 --> 05:43.385
Too few against the minions
of the Dark Regent. Come now.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.596
Into the Sanctum of Sentries.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.695
All the Last Cosmos games
are connected to this computer.

06:01.779 --> 06:04.031
From here, I keep track of many things.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.116
Including the players' scores.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.660
Schway!

06:09.328 --> 06:11.789
You three represent
the cream of the crop.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.083
The highest scorers in all Gotham.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.918
Ultra schway!

06:16.210 --> 06:17.670
You are here because each one of you

06:17.753 --> 06:20.005
has shown extraordinary aptitude.

06:20.089 --> 06:24.009
To us, <i>Last</i> Cosmos is more than a game.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.636
Yeah, it's our whole life.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.347
Your devotion reflects
a profound commitment

06:28.430 --> 06:30.975
to the ideals of the Sentries.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.144
But are you ready to take the next step?

06:44.363 --> 06:45.739
Do you have what it takes

06:45.823 --> 06:48.867
to become real
Sentries of the Last Cosmos?

06:54.373 --> 06:55.791
So get this.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.876
My school counselor says my problem is

06:57.960 --> 06:59.545
<i>- I lack direction.</i>

06:59.628 --> 07:00.668
Go to the Hall of Records.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.382
I'm showing a break-in
at their data bank.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.884
Somehow I don't think
that's what she meant by direction.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.942
A big, smoking hole.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.694
Could be a clue.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.421
Here it is.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.050
The data bank that's been infected
by the Dark Regent.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.766
I thought the Sentry-Con was next month.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.018
Stay back.
We're on a sacred mission.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.854
What, you're gonna
save the planet from the Dark Regent?

07:58.937 --> 08:01.065
Sentries, to the challenge.

08:29.385 --> 08:31.679
Sentries, away.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.173
Terry!

09:10.426 --> 09:12.094
<i>Can you hear me? Terry!</i>

09:15.472 --> 09:16.974
I'm here.

09:17.808 --> 09:18.934
<i>What happened?</i>

09:21.186 --> 09:23.856
I just got my butt fried
by the Sentries Of The Last Cosmos.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.566
What?

09:28.819 --> 09:31.155
You're kidding, right?
Real Sentries?

09:31.238 --> 09:34.158
Yeah. And I've got the real bruises
to prove it.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.241
Weird.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.495
They said they were sent
on a sacred mission by the Wise One.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.122
Wise One?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.332
That's what Corey calls Simon Harper.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.084
The guy who created the game?

09:44.168 --> 09:46.336
He invited Corey to come and meet him.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.338
Do you think there's a connection?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.215
Is Jar Jar lame?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.761
Corey, wait up!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.388
How was Sentrycroft?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.557
Okay, I guess.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.558
Okay?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.477
Come on, give!

10:01.560 --> 10:02.620
That's a hard place to crash.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.562
What's it like?

10:03.645 --> 10:06.523
Yeah, come on, Sentry! Report.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.151
It's just a joke to you,
isn't it, McGinnis?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.402
Well, that's all it was.

10:10.486 --> 10:13.071
Ajoke. A big nothing, okay?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.623
What now, 0 Wise One?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.346
I'm in.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.857
No way a fanboy like Corey
wouldn't spew about this.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.192
<i>He's coverin' somethin'.</i>

10:50.275 --> 10:51.735
Just be careful.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.738
Quite resourceful.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.324
I'll have to program that strategy
into my next game.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.827
And what kind of game is that,
Mr. Harper?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.871
What do you mean?

11:44.746 --> 11:46.748
I met some of your Sentries last night.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.584
They didn't play by the rules.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.588
You must understand.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.798
There are thousands of hard-core fans.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.675
Many dress up as my characters.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.302
Conventions. That sort of thing.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.804
I have absolutely no control over them.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.807
In fact, that very fan fanaticism is why

12:03.891 --> 12:05.976
I've had to install
such elaborate security measures.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.769
So you don't know anything

12:07.853 --> 12:09.372
about those Sentries
at the Hall Of Records?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.733
I'm sorry.
I wish I could be more help. but...

12:23.452 --> 12:24.912
Sentries, to me.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.089
What happened, Wise One?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.842
The Dark Regent's servants
have been here.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.302
We'll find them.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.847
No. I have a more important mission
for you.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.559
The Dark Regent himself
is here on Earth.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.688
He's taken on a human form.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.400
Disguised as a man named Eldon Michaels.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.944
Eldon Michaels?

12:57.653 --> 12:58.820
What are you saying?

12:59.446 --> 13:02.699
<i>Sentries Of The Last</i> Cosmos
<i>is no</i> mere game.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.172
It simulates a real war,

13:17.255 --> 13:20.050
one being fought
in the deepest reaches of space.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.970
For centuries, we Wise Ones have used it

13:23.053 --> 13:24.972
to recruit trainees like yourselves.

13:25.555 --> 13:29.393
Now, you must confront the Dark Regent
to save our universe.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.855
That's all you can find
for Eldon Michaels?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.482
An address?

13:35.565 --> 13:36.650
<i>From a few years ago.</i>

13:36.733 --> 13:38.235
I've checked every data system,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.529
there's nothing on him.
Not even a birth date.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.531
Maybe he really is from outer space.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.392
<i>Danger! Danger!</i>

14:10.475 --> 14:12.394
<i>Danger! Danger!</i>

14:12.477 --> 14:13.937
<i>Danger!</i>

14:17.691 --> 14:18.691
Cute.

14:27.743 --> 14:28.743
Aah!

14:52.059 --> 14:53.560
Ow, that hurt!

14:53.810 --> 14:55.562
"OW, that hurt"?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.732
Eldon Michaels, I presume.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.110
I thought you were somebody else.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.320
Obviously.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.280
What's this, a word processor?

15:05.363 --> 15:07.199
It's a typewriter.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.117
It belonged to Philip K. Dick,

15:09.201 --> 15:11.411
the greatest writer who ever lived.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.871
You're a writer, too?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.539
Well, duh!

15:14.623 --> 15:16.666
Why is Simon Harper after you?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.085
Why?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.045
Because he's a two-faced Janus,

15:20.128 --> 15:21.671
a pirate and a charlatan.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.256
And I can prove it.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.340
Aah!

15:49.741 --> 15:51.034
My research!

15:51.660 --> 15:52.660
Aah!

15:54.037 --> 15:55.037
Aah!

16:08.093 --> 16:10.345
Don't. Stop! Where are you takin' me?

16:10.428 --> 16:13.306
Put me down! Help!

16:32.033 --> 16:32.868
Harper,

16:32.951 --> 16:34.578
miserable recreant.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.746
If you wanted to face me,
do it yourself.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.499
Don't involve these deluded lame-brains.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.459
Why have you brought him here?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.837
What should we have done?

16:44.838 --> 16:45.922
Kill him.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.966
But the Sentries' Code Of Honor.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.385
Like he knows anything about honor.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.096
SHence!

16:53.430 --> 16:54.430
Aah!

16:54.723 --> 16:56.641
He is the Dark Regent.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.143
He must be destroyed.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.479
Dark Regent?

17:01.563 --> 17:02.856
He's plotted against me.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.650
It was a lawsuit, you mad...

17:11.489 --> 17:13.950
Simon, if 20% is too much,

17:14.034 --> 17:15.619
I'II settle for 15.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.828
Lawsuit?

17:16.912 --> 17:18.371
What's he talkin' about?

17:18.455 --> 17:19.706
This.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.922
Get him!

17:41.895 --> 17:42.895
Aah!

17:43.980 --> 17:45.065
What is it?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.401
Written by...

17:48.485 --> 17:50.153
Eldon Michaels?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.279
Right.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.783
Michaels created the game.
Harperjust produced it.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.619
He was supposed to share the profits,
but he went back on the deal.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.037
It's a lie!

18:01.957 --> 18:03.637
That's why he had you destroy
the data bank

18:03.667 --> 18:05.752
where the original contracts
were stored.

18:05.835 --> 18:06.711
Don't listen!

18:06.795 --> 18:09.130
He's trying to cloud your minds.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.847
It's all in here.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.975
There's where Zimzam learned to fly.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.936
From the Eagles of Karisium.

18:23.019 --> 18:26.064
And here's where Aaron gets
the golden feather from Princess Alla.

18:30.694 --> 18:31.569
Aah!

18:31.653 --> 18:35.031
I'II destroy you,
you Pyratheran Moon Slug.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.534
You're starting to believe
your own fiction.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.088
Sentries, to the challenge.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.602
Game over.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.071
So they finally saw through
Harper's smoke and mirrors?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.906
Why did he do it?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.175
Didn't he already have enough money?

19:18.199 --> 19:20.493
It's not easy to give up being God.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.078
I guess you'd know.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.788
Poor kids.

19:23.872 --> 19:26.458
Looking to a video game
for something to believe in.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.418
Yeah. What'll they do now?

19:36.301 --> 19:38.011
What do you want?

19:38.762 --> 19:41.431
You left this at Sentrycroft,
Mr. Michaels.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.350
It's too important
to trust anyone but you.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.811
Thanks.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.397
Wait!

19:49.481 --> 19:50.690
What did the Wise Ones mean

19:50.774 --> 19:53.026
when they said, "Seek the Center"?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.153
And why did they send Aaron to Pyrapera?

19:55.236 --> 19:57.197
And the golden feather,
what's with that?

19:57.280 --> 19:59.324
Hey, it's just a game.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.202
- But you know.
- You're the man.
