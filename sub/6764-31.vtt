DAVID (echoes over P.A.):
Is this thing on?

01:47.440 --> 01:50.902
Testing, testing,
one, two, three, four.

01:50.985 --> 01:55.365
Testing, one, two, three, four.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.158
Is anybody out there?

01:57.242 --> 02:00.161
Check. Check?

02:01.162 --> 02:05.041
Check, check.

02:05.124 --> 02:10.045
Testing, one, two, three.

02:10.128 --> 02:13.883
Mike check for California
University Mardi Gras.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.552
Check, check, check.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.053
Testing.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.223
Testing one, two.

02:20.306 --> 02:24.227
(microphone feedback);
Testing, one, two, three, four.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.895
{\an3}Why do they
always say that?

02:25.979 --> 02:27.272
(carousel music playing)

02:27.355 --> 02:29.440
You got any better ideas?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.109
Yeah. Testing,

{\an3}four, three,

02:33.653 --> 02:35.697
(bell rings,

02:40.952 --> 02:43.204
{\an3}We better
get going.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.039
Where's Steve?

02:45.123 --> 02:46.082
{\an1}KEITH:
Great. (grunting)

02:46.165 --> 02:48.626
{\an3}How much more of this
mud do you think we need?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.545
Keep mixing. If we're gonna fall
in this stuff,

02:50.628 --> 02:51.754
I want a nice soft landing.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.632
I'm telling you guys, we should
have used chocolate pudding.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.885
Muntz, you're always
thinking about food.

02:56.968 --> 02:57.886
What's up with that?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.054
{\an3}Hey, Steve,
come on.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.097
I got to go, guys.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.098
Where you going?

03:02.181 --> 03:04.225
The hospital.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.274
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

03:11.357 --> 03:13.526

Right now,
80 over 60.

We're going to wash
your belly now...

03:24.162 --> 03:26.247
{\an3}MAN:
Instruments sterile?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.207
{\an1}WOMAN:
It may be just a little...

03:32.170 --> 03:34.839
{\an4}MAN:
You should be starting
to feel a little numb now

03:34.923 --> 03:36.132
from the local.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.092
Good. Good.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.137
{\an1}I'm going to give
you some pure oxygen.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.931
{\an1}Take slow
deep breaths.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.932
{\an1}That's it.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.475
(beeping)

03:45.558 --> 03:46.976
There might be some pressure.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.978
Don't worry. Just relax.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.355
Okay, people, let's go. Nurse?

03:50.438 --> 03:53.107
{\an3}All right, okay,
Doctor, we're all set.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.109
{\an4}WOMAN:
Andrea, the baby's
doing fine.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.152
The heart rate's good.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.196
{\an1}We have the pediatrician
standing by.

03:58.279 --> 04:02.033
{\an1}In just a few minutes,
you're going to be a mommy.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.160
(elevator bell dings)

04:05.078 --> 04:06.704
{\an3}Did she
have it yet?

04:06.788 --> 04:07.997
{\an1}No news.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.123
Is anybody else here?

04:09.207 --> 04:10.333
Waiting room.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.043
You know where
the bathroom is?

04:12.126 --> 04:13.169
{\an1}Yeah, it's around
the corner.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.921
{\an1}Hi.
Want some coffee?

04:16.755 --> 04:18.841
Does this mean
we're still talking?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.969
Of course we're still talking.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.887
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Klein, telephone, please.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.514
So, how long have you been here?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.557
{\an1}A couple hours, but, uh,
I've got to go now, though.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.684
Where are you going?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.979
Kevin and I have some business
at Jim Walsh's office.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.358
You got a problem, Kel?

04:36.401 --> 04:39.070
Not anymore.

04:39.153 --> 04:43.157
Dr. Widen, telephone, please.
Dr. Widen.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.202
{\an3}Brandon, what are
you doing here?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.038
{\an1}I thought you were supposed
to be catching a plane to DC.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.999
{\an3}Well, I figured, Andrea
was having a baby.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.209
I'd just blow off
the task force, no big deal.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.544
Brandon.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.004
{\an6}BRENDA:
Kelly, don't
listen to him.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.088
{\an3}He's taking the
red-eye out tonight.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.257
I just wanted to make sure
everything was all right.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.052
Well, what if everything
isn't all right?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.763
Dr. Siedelman...

05:05.847 --> 05:06.723
{\an1}STEVE:
Hey, hey, hey.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.891
{\an1}Guess who I found
wandering around the halls.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.184
Hey, Jesse.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.062
So...
So, are you a dad?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.064
{\an5}Yup, looks
like I am.
All right.

05:15.148 --> 05:15.940
{\an6}Way to
go, Papa.
Thanks.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.526
{\an5}Is it a boy
or a girl?
It's a girl.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.611
{\an3}It's a... it's a very
tiny little girl.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.240
{\an5}Well, can we see her?
Uh, not
for a while.

05:24.323 --> 05:27.410
Since she's a preemie, they
had to take her right into ICU.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.245
{\an1}How's Andrea doing?
Good. Good.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.122
{\an3}She's pretty good. She's still
a little out of it, but...

05:31.205 --> 05:32.081
Well, can we see her?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.958
Steve, she just had a cesarean.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.209
Dr. Beager...

05:35.293 --> 05:36.878
Well, give her our love,
will ya?

05:36.961 --> 05:38.171
I will, I sure will.

05:38.254 --> 05:38.963
Thanks a lot for
coming, you guys.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.049
{\an3}It-It means a lot
to both of us.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.216
{\an3}DAVID:
Take care, man.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.217
Yeah,
thanks, man.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.594
Bye.
See ya.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.387
{\an1}Hey, bro,
this is for the baby.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.097
{\an1}Special delivery
right from Mardi Gras.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.849
What's this?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.434
(Jesse laughs)

05:51.517 --> 05:53.102
Thanks, Steve.
She'll love it.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.604
{\an1}Congratulations.
Thanks.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.064
Well, wait.
What's the baby's name?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.649
Uh, well,
that we're still negotiating.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.027
Well, I still vote for Brenda.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.779
{\an3}You would.
Oh, bye.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.072
See you.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.198
Listen, Bran,

06:05.281 --> 06:07.450
{\an1}I know you've got to leave
town tonight, but if you could

06:07.533 --> 06:09.410
{\an1}hang around a while,
Andrea would love to see you.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.370
Lead the way.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.082
Dr. Weiss, telephone, please.
Dr. Weiss...

06:14.165 --> 06:16.167
You know, before
we go in there,

06:16.250 --> 06:18.628
{\an1}you should know that things
with the baby are going

06:18.711 --> 06:21.464
{\an1}to be touch and go
for the next 48 hours.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.508
She's-She's really small.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.177
{\an3}How small?

06:26.260 --> 06:27.345
(sighs)

06:27.428 --> 06:29.263
Two pounds, eight ounces.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.476
Well, you know
what they say.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.103
{\an3}Good things come
in small packages.

06:35.186 --> 06:38.231
Yeah. Let's hope so.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.234
You know, I...

06:43.236 --> 06:47.281
I'm trying to keep my spirits up
for Andrea, but, man, it's hard.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.283
Well, you're doing
a great job, man.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.244
{\an1}Thanks.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.219
Hiya, Chief.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.182
(quiet sigh)

07:13.266 --> 07:15.184
Brandon, you stayed.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.144
{\an3}BRANDON:
Of course.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.188
I wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.692
You know they won't
let me see my baby yet.

07:22.775 --> 07:26.404
Well, that's just because
they're sprucing her up for you.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.242
Jesse said she has my nose.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.660
{\an3}Cutest little nose
I've ever seen.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.245
{\an1}(laughs)

07:34.328 --> 07:35.496
So, how you doing?

07:36.497 --> 07:39.167
I don't know, I'm numb.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.877
How long you got to stay
in this joint?

07:40.960 --> 07:43.296
As long as they let me.

07:44.463 --> 07:47.175
I'm not going to go home
until my baby does.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.846
Well, then, I guess

07:51.929 --> 07:55.224
I'll see you two
when I get back from Washington.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.936
Say hi to Bill and Hillary
for us, would you?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.771
Will do.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.857
Give 'em hell, Brand.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.942
You give 'em hell.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.074
Thanks.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.367
Bye.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.577
{\an3}See ya.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.288
{\an1}Hmm.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.256
{\an3}So, if just you turn to
page 17 in the prospectus,

08:27.340 --> 08:29.926
{\an3}you'll note that
we've separated out

08:30.009 --> 08:32.220
the R &amp; D costs
from the initial startup funds,

08:32.303 --> 08:33.763
and we've purposely tried

08:33.846 --> 08:36.097
{\an1}to keep the initial returns
relatively conservative.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.600
{\an3}Too conservative,
in my opinion.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.269
Well, we certainly want
to err on the side of caution.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.063
{\an1}I really appreciate
everything you've all done.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.400
Uh, anybody else here
need a bathroom break?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.277
I do.
Excuse me.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.738
Take your time.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.073
(phone ringing)

08:52.156 --> 08:53.282
Kevin, I, uh...

08:53.366 --> 08:55.326
{\an3}I'm not the only one
in the room there

08:55.409 --> 08:57.328
{\an5}that didn't fully
understand what was
going on, right?

08:57.411 --> 09:00.331
{\an1}To tell you the truth,
it went over my head, too,

09:00.414 --> 09:02.333
{\an4}and I'm the one who invented
the damn thing.
Yeah.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.961
Guys, relax. The company
is behind you on this.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.338
Well, I wish I could have
paid more attention in there,

09:07.421 --> 09:09.131
but to tell you the truth,

09:09.215 --> 09:11.300
all I could think about
is getting married tomorrow.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.927
Congratulations.
That's great.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.178
{\an1}KEVIN:
Thanks.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.305
I better hit the head.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.640
Hurry back.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.810
What, are you a
little anxious?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.270
Dylan, the people in that room

09:22.353 --> 09:24.438
represent an awful lot
of investment capital.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.858
The people in that room
are going to make me a rich man.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.819
{\an5}(laughs)
Thought you already were
a rich man.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.239
Well...

09:33.322 --> 09:35.908
(carousel music playing)

09:35.992 --> 09:38.703
(women screaming)

09:43.916 --> 09:47.420
{\an5}DAVID (over P.A.):
Well, it looks like the Spring
Carnival has officially begun.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.797
{\an1}And already we have
our first lost child.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.674
So if the parents
of Maxine Frankel

09:51.757 --> 09:53.426
are looking for her,
don't worry.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.802
She's doing just fine.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.886
{\an1}And spend
that money, guys.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.307
{\an1}Remember, it's all going
to the Cal Camp General Fund.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.057
We got rides,

10:00.141 --> 10:02.852
we got games, we
got great food.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.396
And on the main stage
in about five minutes,

10:05.479 --> 10:08.232
we've got the South Quad's
own Green Tangerine.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.402
{\an3}And we got great acts
coming up all weekend long.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.529
{\an1}Going out with a bang
this Sunday

10:13.612 --> 10:15.531
{\an1}live and in person,
we have Babyface.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
As a matter of fact,

10:17.241 --> 10:19.243
one of his people
are here right now

10:19.327 --> 10:22.371
making sure that everything is
just hunky-dory for the big guy.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.332
Everything is okay, isn't it?

10:26.584 --> 10:29.003
{\an3}Uh, oh, so enjoy
yourselves,

10:29.086 --> 10:30.671
{\an3}and we'll keep
you posted.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.298
What's Ariel doing here?

10:32.381 --> 10:34.050
I just talked to
her this morning.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.261
She's just doing her job.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.512
{\an3}Hey, guys.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.930
Hey, Ariel.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.265
The stage looks amazing.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.267
Yeah, well, we aim to please.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.227
So, is everything okay?

10:45.311 --> 10:48.189
{\an5}Yeah, great. I um...
I stopped by to give
you the guest list.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.067
{\an3}I know it's a little long,
but you know how it is.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.361
I can imagine.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.029
{\an3}Oh, and while I'm
here, I was wondering

10:55.112 --> 10:56.739
{\an3}if you guys had any
extra parking passes.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.240
Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
{\an5}Come on. I'll get 'em
for you.
Great.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.078
Good to see you again, Donna.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.455
Same here.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.421
{\an5}STEVE:
Come on, Muntz,
swing harder and aim!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.090
Come on, he's lunch meat!

11:14.173 --> 11:17.551
Pretend he's a cupcake
and ice him.

11:17.635 --> 11:21.222
Friends, Romans, countrymen!

11:21.305 --> 11:26.394
Step right up and fight
the gladiator of your choice.

11:26.477 --> 11:30.106
(laughing)

11:30.189 --> 11:31.941
Muntz, you're an animal.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.735
(groans)

11:34.819 --> 11:37.154
{\an3}We got to change
the rules here, guys.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.447
Come on, think about it.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.281
Every time you get put
in the mud,

11:39.365 --> 11:40.908
some little kid gets to go
to camp.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.284
{\an3}Oh, you're gonna get
yours, Sanders.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.285
{\an3}Believe me,
you'll get yours.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.829
I don't think so.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.122
{\an1}Who in their right mind
is gonna fight me

11:46.205 --> 11:48.290
{\an1}when they can pick you
to fight, huh?

11:48.374 --> 11:50.126
{\an3}KEITH:
Yo, Sanders, you're up.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.335
I am?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.254
Yeah, and wait till you get
a look at your competition.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.881
You remember John Sears,
don't you?

12:01.512 --> 12:03.347
Hi, Stevie.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.144
{\an3}What'd you think, Sanders,
I'd just disappear?

12:08.227 --> 12:09.478
Huh?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.188
{\an3}(chuckles)

12:11.272 --> 12:12.481
{\an3}You know, I used to
own the KEG House

12:12.565 --> 12:13.482
till you came along.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.152
{\an3}In fact, I've never been
knocked off this pole.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.653
How about you?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.447
(yells)

12:24.243 --> 12:27.329
(spits)

12:30.082 --> 12:31.125
{\an1}So what are
you going to wear?

12:31.208 --> 12:32.501
{\an3}Same thing Bill's
going to wear--

12:32.585 --> 12:34.211
a suit and a tie.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.131
You sure you don't want us
to drive you to the airport?

12:37.214 --> 12:40.176
No, Mom, I think it would be
easier if I just drove myself.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.510
{\an1}You know,
when Bill Clinton was a kid,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.471
{\an1}he shook hands
with President Kennedy.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.513
Maybe this is an omen.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.850
A lot of people shake
the president's hand, Dad,

12:47.933 --> 12:49.977
not many of them
become president.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.228
{\an3}Jim, I think you better
go move your car.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.480
You're blocking Brandon.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.647
See you downstairs.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.524
{\an3}Yeah.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.650
{\an3}(sighs)

12:56.734 --> 12:58.277
{\an1}(giggles)

12:58.360 --> 12:59.862
I don't know how
I'm gonna break it to him--

12:59.945 --> 13:02.031
I really have no interest
in professional politics.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.365
Forget it, Brandon.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.327
I'm already making plans
for your inaugural ball.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.371
Well, good, then when you become
a big Hollywood movie star,

13:09.455 --> 13:12.500
just make sure all your friends
contribute to my campaign.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.586
Sure, only if you invite
all of us to sleep over

13:15.669 --> 13:17.004
at the White House.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.422
Deal.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.382
Listen, I've got to get going.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.051
Roy Randolph asked me
to meet him

13:22.134 --> 13:23.260
before he leaves
for out of town.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.847
So... have a good trip.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.683
Thanks.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.895
Look, I just want you to know,

13:32.978 --> 13:34.647
{\an3}I think it's really great
what you're doing.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.232
Well, I appreciate that.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.568
You know for a sister,
you're not half bad.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.696
Well, don't you ever forget it.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.410
Have fun.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.121
See ya.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.968
{\an3}Hey, Roy.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.095
Oh, Brenda.
Glad you could come.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.638
{\an1}Well, I couldn't let
you leave town

14:07.721 --> 14:09.598
{\an1}without saying good-bye,
now could I?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.183
What are you working on?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.768
{\an3}Oh, I'm blocking
my next play.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.645
{\an3}It's a production
of <i> Saint Joan.</i>

14:14.728 --> 14:15.646
You could audition

14:15.729 --> 14:18.065
if you'd be willing to
cut off all your hair.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.318
I would cut off all my hair
for the part...

14:21.402 --> 14:22.444
not the audition.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.571
Touché.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.948
So, when are you leaving?

14:26.031 --> 14:29.618
I'll be back in New York
the day after tomorrow.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.371
{\an3}I just wanted to say good-bye
to my leading lady

14:32.454 --> 14:34.498
{\an3}and to find out what
she's doing this summer.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.833
Why?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.751
'Cause there's
a terrific program

14:37.835 --> 14:39.587
at the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Arts

14:39.670 --> 14:41.130
you might want to consider.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.257
In London?

14:43.340 --> 14:44.675
Well, unless there's
another Royal Academy

14:44.758 --> 14:46.135
I don't know about.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.304
Isn't it a little late?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.222
I mean, I'm sure they've already
had their auditions by now.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.307
If you're interested,

14:51.390 --> 14:55.144
all it would take is one
transatlantic phone call.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.106
Wow. You'd do that for me?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.608
You deserve it.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.818
You're very talented, Brenda.

15:02.901 --> 15:06.196
You have a real future
as an actress if you want one.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.449
(sighs)

15:08.532 --> 15:09.950
Can I think it over?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.535
Well, don't take too long.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.621
Classes start in two weeks.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.174
How you doing?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.967
(moans softly)

15:27.051 --> 15:30.179
My throat's dry.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.350
Can you get me those ice chips
over there?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.976
{\an3}Yeah.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.814
How did you sleep?

15:40.898 --> 15:42.149
I didn't.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.692
{\an3}Why?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.194
Didn't the nurse give
you anything?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.988
It didn't work.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.160
I kept thinking about...

15:53.243 --> 15:54.370
about Hannah.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.996
Do you like the name?

15:56.080 --> 15:57.039
It's a beautiful name.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.333
{\an3}But I think we should hold
off naming the baby...

15:59.416 --> 16:00.751
Good morning.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.586
Mm, Connie, hi.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.339
{\an1}I'm ready to roll
when you are.

16:05.422 --> 16:06.382
{\an1}CONNIE:
Great.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.676
(Andrea groans)
Go easy, girl.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.511
You're going to be sore
for the next few days.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.012
Wait a second.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.056
{\an3}Where are you going?
To see the baby.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.891
{\an1}Andrea...
It's okay.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.726
Dr. Gordon said it was fine,
Jesse.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.894
Hold on a second.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.354
{\an3}I need to talk
to my wife.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.731
{\an3}Oh, sure.
Thanks.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.236
Jesse, what's wrong?

16:27.319 --> 16:29.238
Andrea, I don't think
it's a good idea

16:29.321 --> 16:30.572
if we go down there right now.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.741
Why? Has something happened?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.911
Well, the baby had
a rough night.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.371
How rough?

16:39.331 --> 16:40.666
Well, she stopped breathing
at one point.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.254
Oh, my God.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.422
{\an3}They put her
on a respirator

16:46.505 --> 16:47.506
and she's doing better,

16:47.589 --> 16:49.883
but they still want to give
her a blood transfusion

16:49.967 --> 16:51.260
{\an3}and put her on
some antibiotics.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.761
I have to go to her.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.762
{\an3}Andrea...

16:53.846 --> 16:54.221
let's just wait.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.389
I'm her mother.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.099
I have to be with her.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.602
Okay. All right.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.439
{\an3}I'm Helen, your
daughter's nurse.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.647
How's she doing?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.108
Much better.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.109
She's very alert.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.611
Which one is she?

17:09.694 --> 17:10.820
{\an3}Right here.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.704
Oh, Jesse.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.123
She's beautiful.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.416
{\an4}HELEN:
Go ahead,
you can touch her.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.296
{\an3}Just put your hands
through the portholes.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.595
Hey, baby.

17:34.678 --> 17:37.347
Hi, Hannah.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.558
It's Mommy.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.985
{\an3}It's Mommy.

17:50.068 --> 17:52.488
{\an3}Hi, baby.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.115
{\an3}Hi, Hannah.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.191
Chancellor.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}Brandon, you made it.
Yeah.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.069
{\an1}Excuse us.
How was the flight?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.862
Oh, it was great.
I slept all the way in.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.364
Good, because we've got
a big day ahead of us.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.740
Did I miss anything?

18:36.824 --> 18:37.866
{\an3}No. We're on
Washington time.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.910
{\an5}Everything starts
ten minutes late.
Of course.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.078
{\an3}Well, there is
one person

18:41.161 --> 18:42.287
{\an3}who'll be very glad
to see you.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.831
Who's that?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.918
Clare.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.045
Brandon, what a surprise.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.463
(Arnold laughs)

18:51.547 --> 18:53.006
Don't listen to
a word she says.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.049
She must have asked
the desk clerk 50 times

18:54.132 --> 18:55.759
if you'd checked in yet.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.636
Excuse me, just a minute.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.390
I think Senator Boxer
just walked in.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.019
What are you doing here?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.521
{\an3}Officially?

19:07.604 --> 19:09.231
{\an3}I'm looking at
Eastern colleges.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.025
But unofficially...

19:12.109 --> 19:13.694
{\an1}Clare, listen...
Mm.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.697
{\an3}Looks like Dean Trimble's
doing all right for himself.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.535
I don't believe it.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.917
{\an3}Brandon, you've met Lucinda
Nicholson, haven't you?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.294
{\an3}Yeah. Hi.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.087
{\an1}It's so nice to see you
again, Brandon.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.089
{\an3}You, too. What are
you doing here?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.091
{\an1}I had a meeting
with the NEA about my film.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.926
{\an1}Oh, really,
you're a filmmaker?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.219
Documentaries.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.263
We haven't met
yet, have we?

19:41.346 --> 19:44.016
{\an6}TRIMBLE:
Oh, this is Chancellor
Arnold's daughter, Clare.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.100
{\an1}Hi.
Nice to meet you.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.184
Are you a student at CU?

19:46.268 --> 19:48.729
Uh, not quite.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.897
{\an3}You see, Clare will
be graduating

19:49.980 --> 19:51.315
{\an3}from high school
this June.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.900
{\an3}LUCINDA:
Oh, really?

19:52.983 --> 19:55.611
{\an1}Yeah, Brandon here took me
to my senior prom.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.112
{\an3}LUCINDA:
Really?

19:57.195 --> 19:59.156
{\an1}Well, I'm sure he looked
quite smashing in his tux.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.115
I didn't wear a tux.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.284
I wore a dark suit.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.077
{\an1}Oh. How festive.
Yes.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.329
{\an3}Well, I'm gonna
get going

20:05.412 --> 20:07.247
and leave you three
to get acquainted.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.916
{\an3}Okay, see you later.
See you later.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.335
{\an1}Bye, Dean.
See you.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.088
{\an6}MAN:
Hold it right
there, folks.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.298
Let me get your picture.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.132
{\an1}Oh, good.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.968
We'll have something
to remember this by.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.768
Oh. How can I call him, Herb?

20:27.851 --> 20:30.145
The guy's getting married
this morning.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.980
If I do, you'll be
the first to know.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.106
{\an3}All right.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.401
How inconsiderate of Kevin
to run off and get married

20:36.485 --> 20:39.029
without closing
his deal first.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.781
{\an1}It would have made my life
a hell of lot easier

20:40.864 --> 20:42.616
{\an1}if he and Dylan had signed
on the dotted line.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.909
Is there a problem?

20:43.992 --> 20:44.868
{\an1}No, no.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.036
It's just been a long time

20:46.119 --> 20:47.663
{\an1}since I've put a deal together
with this much riding on it.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.124
{\an3}Honey, it'll be fine;
it always is.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.502
(British accent):
Morning, Guv'nor. Morning, Mum.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.212
{\an1}Got a spot of tea
to warm up me ol' cockles?

20:55.295 --> 20:59.007
{\an6}(British accent):
Are we rehearsing
for a new play, luv?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.384
No, more like a whole new life.

21:01.969 --> 21:05.722
Actually, I'm thinking
of going to London.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.848
You are?

21:06.932 --> 21:08.308
All I need is a plane ticket.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.352
What are we talking about here?

21:10.435 --> 21:13.063
{\an1}Roy Randolph said that
he could get me into a program

21:13.146 --> 21:16.024
{\an1}at the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Arts this summer.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.193
You're not kidding.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.236
No, I'm not.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.988
{\an1}Look, Mom,
it's a real honor.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.573
{\an1}And I don't even have
to audition.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.659
How much is this
going to set me back?

21:25.742 --> 21:28.203
{\an1}Nothing. I've hardly spent
any of the money that I made

21:28.286 --> 21:29.997
working for you this year,

21:30.080 --> 21:31.957
{\an1}and I want to spend it
on this.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.168
If that's okay
with you guys.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.047
Looks, it's only for the summer.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.719
Why not?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.554
Good.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.930
Roy has a lot of faith in me.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.390
I wouldn't want to let him down.

21:48.473 --> 21:52.269
Honey,<i> we</i> have a lot
of faith in you, too.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.646
We sure do.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.151
(carousel music playing)

22:01.111 --> 22:02.112
Let's go, baby.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.405
Throw it. Throw it.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.157
Here we go.
What's up? What's up?

22:06.324 --> 22:08.118
Oh! Hey, why don't you

22:08.201 --> 22:09.202
try throwing left-handed,
Silver?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.079
It slipped! Okay.

22:11.163 --> 22:11.913
Come on, David, get him.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.457
Wait, wait,
whose side are you on?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.459
Hey, it's for charity, okay?

22:15.542 --> 22:17.419
(groans)

22:18.962 --> 22:20.213
Yeah, well, I never did
know a piano player

22:20.297 --> 22:20.964
who could throw a baseball.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.216
That's real funny.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.177
Why don't you try it, Donna?

22:25.260 --> 22:27.095
{\an3}Okay. Let a woman
show you how.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.890
Uh-oh, he's sending
in his girlfriend.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.059
Oh, boy, he's going down.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.771
(bell rings)
Whoa!

22:35.854 --> 22:37.272
(crowd cheering)

22:37.355 --> 22:39.357
(David laughing)

22:40.358 --> 22:42.152
(groans)

22:42.235 --> 22:43.320
{\an6}DAVID:
Look at that!
Look at that!

22:43.403 --> 22:45.113
{\an1}Look at that muscle.
Ugh, throwing arm!

22:45.197 --> 22:47.657
And here it is,
I thought you were my friend.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.076
{\an3}Hey, you get
back up there,

22:49.159 --> 22:50.118
we've got people waiting.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.204
Oh, oh...

22:54.206 --> 22:55.749
{\an1}Listen, I've got
to go back to the stage,

22:55.832 --> 22:58.168
{\an1}so, uh, you want
to go get a bite to eat?

22:58.251 --> 22:59.961
{\an3}Oh. I promised Bren
and Kelly I'd meet them

23:00.045 --> 23:01.755
{\an3}for a late breakfast
after my shift.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.633
{\an4}All right, well,
I'll see you later.
Okay.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.263
David!

23:10.347 --> 23:10.972
{\an3}Hey.
I can't believe

23:11.056 --> 23:12.891
I found you in
this madhouse.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.351
You were looking for me?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.353
Yeah.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.647
Well, what's up?

23:18.730 --> 23:19.981
Is everything okay
for tomorrow night?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.691
As far as I know.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.111
{\an3}Babyface will be here
for sound check by 3:00.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.071
Great, so what's up?

23:26.154 --> 23:28.073
Well...

23:28.156 --> 23:30.242
How about something to eat?

23:34.454 --> 23:35.455
(clears throat)

23:35.539 --> 23:37.541
One more please.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.254
{\an1}Ariel.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.296
{\an3}Hi, Donna.
Hey.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.967
{\an1}Um, oh, you-you
forgot these.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.135
Oh, great.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.845
Tell Kelly and Brenda
I said, hi.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.430
I will.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.309
Mmm.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.065
So, all I need to do is find
a flat near the school.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.359
Well, Knightsbridge is great,
but it's expensive.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.903
Well, then I won't
be living there.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.866
Hey, guess who's going
to London this summer?

24:10.949 --> 24:12.159
You are?

24:12.242 --> 24:12.993
No, not me, Brenda.

24:13.076 --> 24:14.161
But now we have
an excuse to visit.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.079
Yeah, Roy Randolph got me

24:16.163 --> 24:17.414
into a summer drama
program over there.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.166
That's great.
Congratulations.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.667
Thanks.
So what are we eating?

24:20.750 --> 24:22.711
I'm not hungry.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.171
What's the matter?

24:24.254 --> 24:27.382
I saw Ariel eating
a hotdog with David

24:27.465 --> 24:29.176
and I lost my appetite.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.011
Who's Ariel?

24:31.094 --> 24:32.429
She's in the music business.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.181
She's trying to get David
into some band.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.016
But, you know, the more
I see them together,

24:36.099 --> 24:37.392
I think she just wants
to get into his pants.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.769
Look, you cannot be jealous

24:39.853 --> 24:41.271
of every girl
that David talks to.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.772
Really, he loves you.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.191
That's easy for you to say.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.026
You guys slept
with your boyfriends.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.068
What do I have to hold him?

24:47.152 --> 24:50.238
Look, Donna, you cannot hold on
to a guy with sex.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.573
I'm living proof of that.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.325
So am I.

24:54.951 --> 24:56.286
You know, Kelly,
after everything

24:56.369 --> 24:57.913
that we've been through,

24:57.996 --> 24:59.247
it looks like we're right back
where we started.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.292
Hmm. Eat your heart out,
Dylan McKay.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.169
{\an3}Hmm.
Hmm.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.176
Look at those two.

25:11.259 --> 25:14.095
That lady is my wife.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.138
And that's my
daughter now.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.433
{\an1}Yeah, so you better
take care of the both of them.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.727
Especially the little one.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.312
She's my family.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.106
{\an3}Suzanne told me
about your father.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.525
What did she say?

25:29.277 --> 25:31.196
She said he had a big heart.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.449
I didn't get to see that part.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.284
Not until the end anyway.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.413
Listen, I don't know
if it's fate or what,

25:40.497 --> 25:42.958
{\an3}but something brought
us all together.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.794
And that's just fine with me.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.921
Yeah.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.174
{\an3}So, Dylan,

25:51.258 --> 25:53.301
{\an3}what do you think of this
deal your friend Walsh

25:53.385 --> 25:55.303
{\an3}is putting
together for us?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.097
Well, I think
it's a little complicated.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.181
Limited partnerships,

25:58.265 --> 26:00.809
{\an1}cross-collateralized
syndication...

26:00.892 --> 26:03.144
Did you see them in there?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.105
They were drooling, Dylan.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.649
{\an3}They are dying to get their
hands on what we've got.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.609
So then it's a deal.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.486
{\an3}Dylan, buddy, you're
missing the point.

26:11.569 --> 26:14.155
I don't follow.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.367
{\an3}Until I sat in that
room yesterday,

26:17.450 --> 26:20.370
{\an3}even I didn't know how
big this thing could be.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.458
So what you're saying is,

26:25.542 --> 26:27.168
you want to cut them out?

26:27.252 --> 26:30.463
Let's just not rush
into anything, okay?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.217
This is the most shrimp
I've ever seen in my life.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.136
And they're huge.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.638
I think your eyes are bigger
than your stomach.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.183
I saw you two
in a huddle over here.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.686
Are you talking business
on my wedding day?

26:44.769 --> 26:47.188
Okay, you popped me.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.189
{\an1}I'm sorry.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.483
Not... not another word.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.236
Could I have one of those
shrimp, please?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.492
(carousel music playing)

27:07.876 --> 27:09.878
{\an1}Celeste!

27:09.961 --> 27:12.172
Steve.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.507
{\an1}Hey, you look great.
Thanks.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.384
You know, you can't go on this
Ferris wheel all by yourself.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.053
It's un-American.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.387
I'm not.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.306
{\an3}You're here with someone?
Yeah.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.182
Oh, cool, a guy?

27:22.265 --> 27:25.393
Yes, actually he goes
to school here.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.228
Really? How long you
been going out?

27:27.312 --> 27:28.605
Only a couple of weeks.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.690
But I'm really happy.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.025
He's really nice.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.443
And he's really tall.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.362
And he's really good-looking.

27:35.445 --> 27:38.031
And he's really hot.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.408
Really?

27:40.492 --> 27:42.327
Hi, Stevie.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.209
Bye, Stevie.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.294
Bye.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.012
Wow, great lunch, huh?

28:01.096 --> 28:03.306
{\an3}I always eat too
much at these things.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.267
Listen, guys, I want to
go rest up for a minute.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.435
{\an3}The time change is
starting to get to me.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.770
{\an3}I'll catch you
later, okay?

28:08.853 --> 28:11.022
{\an1}Don't be too long.
We're up in a half hour.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.045
(water begins running)

28:59.612 --> 29:02.323
{\an3}Clare, what
are you doing?

29:02.407 --> 29:03.950
Having a shower.

29:04.033 --> 29:07.162
Hmm. How did you get in here?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.997
I have my ways.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.416
Of course you do.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.503
Shower's over.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.006
{\an3}Hey! I haven't
washed my hair yet.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.049
Okay, fine.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.968
Finish up and get dressed.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.472
Thanks, Brandon.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.353
{\an1}Your shower's
much better than mine.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.688
{\an3}Clare, why aren't
you dressed?

29:33.771 --> 29:37.233
{\an1}'Cause, I don't have to give
a speech in 15 minutes.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.736
Besides, I'm always more
comfortable au naturel.

29:39.819 --> 29:42.030
Hmm.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.199
How did you know I was even
gonna be up here, anyway?

29:44.282 --> 29:46.034
I took a shot.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.036
I figured you had
to come up eventually.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.537
Hmm, and what if I'd

29:49.621 --> 29:51.164
come in with your father?

29:51.247 --> 29:54.375
Oh... I hadn't thought of that.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.336
Mm-hmm. Listen, Clare...

29:56.419 --> 29:59.047
Brandon, would
you just relax?

29:59.130 --> 30:01.883
I mean, you should be
enjoying yourself.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.885
Here you are
in Washington, DC,

30:03.968 --> 30:06.012
in a great hotel,

30:06.095 --> 30:07.680
{\an1}and you're about
to deliver a speech that

30:07.764 --> 30:09.599
my father says is going
to blow away the room.

30:11.267 --> 30:14.562
And then when you're
finished with that,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.148
you get to come back up here

30:17.232 --> 30:19.359
and be with me.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.236
Is that so terrible?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.705
All right.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.082
I give up.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.209
Good.

30:49.138 --> 30:51.057
Go.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.101
You're going to be late.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.147
Do me a favor.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.233
Don't go anywhere.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.124
(elevator bell dings)

31:17.375 --> 31:18.751
{\an3}You know what
I'm saying?

31:18.835 --> 31:20.295
{\an3}John Sears
is a reptile.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.462
You said so yourself.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.423
{\an1}No, I said he was
a cockroach.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.592
{\an1}And Celeste is a big girl,
and it is her life.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.135
{\an3}Do you know how
many times that guy

31:27.218 --> 31:28.678
{\an3}dumped me in the
mud yesterday?

31:28.761 --> 31:30.096
{\an1}Steve, would you
get over it?

31:30.179 --> 31:32.348
We're here to see Andrea
and Jesse and the baby.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.766
{\an3}I don't know if
I can handle that.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.435
{\an3}I once saw this
story on preemies.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.644
It grossed me out.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.979
Steve!

31:38.062 --> 31:39.439
I just don't want to
say the wrong thing.

31:39.522 --> 31:40.690
What do you say to them?

31:40.773 --> 31:41.941
"Oh, the kid's so cute.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.651
{\an3}The kid looks like Yoda."
What do you say?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.153
You don't say anything.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.321
You just be a friend.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.617
{\an4}JESSE:
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.659
ANDREA:
You keep saying it's okay.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.119
It's not okay, all right?!

31:53.202 --> 31:55.204
Nothing is okay!

31:56.414 --> 31:57.665
Hi.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.126
Hi, Kelly.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.004
And Steve.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.506
If it's a bad time,
we could come back.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.091
No, no, no.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.009
Please, come in.

32:08.092 --> 32:10.553
I don't know when
it would be a good time.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.851
How you doing, big guy?

32:16.934 --> 32:19.145
I could be better.
Yeah.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.189
Hey, Andrea.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.482
How's the baby doing?

32:22.565 --> 32:24.525
ANDREA:
We don't know.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.694
She's fighting.
We're fighting.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.029
I spend a lot of time

32:28.112 --> 32:29.530
yelling at doctors
like they really need that.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.074
You just want to make sure

32:31.157 --> 32:32.784
they're doing
everything they can.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.578
{\an3}I wish there was
something I could do.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.747
Actually, there is.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.123
Will you get
my husband out of here?

32:39.207 --> 32:40.541
Andrea...

32:40.625 --> 32:42.001
Please, Jesse, just
take a walk, okay?

32:42.085 --> 32:44.545
Get some fresh air.
Are you sure?

32:44.629 --> 32:47.048
I would if I could.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.008
Okay.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.010
I love you.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.096
Me, you.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.269
{\an3}Oh, man, he's trying to
be so strong, Kelly,

33:00.353 --> 33:02.146
and I'm just falling apart.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.149
What can I do?

33:05.233 --> 33:06.984
Wash your hair,
give you a foot massage?

33:11.155 --> 33:13.199
Come with me to see my baby.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.034
I'd be honored.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.412
Great.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.830
Get me my robe.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.500
{\an3}Thank you.

33:22.583 --> 33:25.461
(carousel music playing)

33:25.545 --> 33:29.048
Huge and big and large...

33:29.132 --> 33:30.425
This is so cool.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.426
Yep, it's pretty cool.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.760
{\an1}So what do you want
to do first?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.846
Bearded lady,
dog-faced boy?

33:34.929 --> 33:38.057
Everything.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.642
{\an3}Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.602
{\an3}She's a kid,
she's my sister.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.151
Hold tight there.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.819
There you-- oh!

33:49.902 --> 33:50.987
CINDY:
Dylan!

33:51.070 --> 33:52.572
Hey!

33:52.655 --> 33:54.866
It's all right, you just got
to concentrate, it's balance.

33:54.949 --> 33:55.658
Hey, how was the wedding?

33:55.742 --> 33:57.076
{\an3}Oh, it was
very nice.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.953
{\an6}JIM:
Looks like Erica's
having a great time.

33:59.036 --> 33:59.996
Are you kidding?

34:00.079 --> 34:01.122
She's having the
time of her life,

34:01.205 --> 34:03.916
look at her.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.835
Hey, Dylan, can I try again?

34:05.918 --> 34:06.753
{\an3}Yeah, you
can go again.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.795
{\an3}I think I got a
ticket or two or ten.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.089
{\an3}Come on, you
can go all day.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.507
Will you excuse us
for a second, please?

34:11.591 --> 34:13.426
{\an3}Be right back,
Spiderwoman.

34:14.844 --> 34:15.928
Let me have some!

34:16.012 --> 34:18.639
{\an1}I hate to bring up business
with a mouth full of popcorn,

34:18.723 --> 34:20.308
{\an1}but did Kevin say
anything about the meeting?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.810
No. But he's probably got
other things on his mind

34:22.893 --> 34:24.312
{\an6}right now,
you know?
(sighs)

34:24.395 --> 34:26.147
{\an1}I hate to seem pushy,
but... I'm having

34:26.230 --> 34:27.815
a lot of pressure
to close the deal.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.609
{\an3}Jim, you're talking
to the wrong guy here.

34:29.692 --> 34:30.985
{\an3}I mean, Kevin's holding
all the cards.

34:31.068 --> 34:33.612
So... give me a hint.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.114
What's he waiting for?

34:35.197 --> 34:37.658
{\an3}I don't know, maybe for
his honeymoon to be over?

34:37.742 --> 34:38.826
What do you think?

34:38.909 --> 34:40.286
BRENDA:
Mom, would you, like,

34:40.369 --> 34:41.788
take Dad to the
Tunnel of Love

34:41.871 --> 34:42.830
{\an3}or something?
Mellow him out.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.166
I'm mellow, I'm mellow.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.793
(rings bell)

34:46.876 --> 34:47.960
Oh!
Hey!

34:48.043 --> 34:48.543
Hey!

34:48.628 --> 34:50.670
(happy shriek)

34:55.927 --> 34:59.305
{\an3}Oh, I can't believe
how tiny she is.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.182
{\an3}Look at her perfect
little fingers.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.017
Isn't she adorable?

35:03.100 --> 35:05.144
Hi, sweetie...

35:05.228 --> 35:07.188
Hey.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.149
Hi, I'm Helen.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.526
{\an3}Hi.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.860
Andrea how do you feel?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.529
A little better.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.365
Well, you're not
the only one.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.699
Your baby's breathing
is stabilized

35:18.783 --> 35:22.745
<i>and</i> she hasn't lost any weight
in the last eight hours.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.038
Finally.

35:24.121 --> 35:25.832
(laughs)

35:25.915 --> 35:27.792
Want to help me
give her a bath?

35:27.875 --> 35:29.043
Really?

35:29.126 --> 35:30.545
Wait right here.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.879
I'll get some warm water.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.759
You know, you haven't even
told me what her name is.

35:36.843 --> 35:40.012
We were thinking
of calling her Hannah.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.556
It means "hope."

35:43.599 --> 35:46.227
{\an3}Well, you better get
your crayons out, Mom.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.061
Why?

35:47.144 --> 35:48.521
Look at all these
other incubators.

35:48.604 --> 35:50.773
They're all decorated.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.235
What's the matter?

35:54.318 --> 35:56.070
It's Jesse.

35:56.153 --> 35:57.697
He won't admit it, but I...

35:57.780 --> 35:59.907
I know he's terrified.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.909
{\an1}He couldn't even
bring himself

36:01.993 --> 36:05.079
{\an1}to put her name on
the birth certificate.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.257
{\an3}Steve, don't hate me
for saying this, but...

36:16.340 --> 36:18.050
man, I feel like I'm
living in the middle

36:18.134 --> 36:19.927
{\an3}of someone else's
nightmare right now.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.971
I meet a girl, we go
out a couple times,

36:22.054 --> 36:25.266
{\an3}I'm crazy about her
and then-- boom.

36:25.349 --> 36:26.767
One second later
we're married

36:26.851 --> 36:28.603
{\an3}and we have a two-pound,
six-ounce preemie upstairs.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.773
{\an3}I wanted to take Andrea
around the world.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.985
{\an3}I wanted to get to
know her, for God's sake.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.237
Well, I know her.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.238
She's a great girl,

36:39.322 --> 36:41.240
Funny, smart.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.700
A great kisser.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.578
You kissed my wife?

36:45.661 --> 36:47.747
Once.

36:47.830 --> 36:48.956
A long, long time ago.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.250
We were cramming for our SATs.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.002
Of course, she got a 1,500.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.254
Of course.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.131
So who does the
baby look like?

36:57.214 --> 36:58.132
I don't know.

36:58.215 --> 36:59.508
I guess she looks like me.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.676
She's definitely a Vasquez.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.470
You're lucky.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.971
I don't know anybody
that looks like me.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.431
I'm adopted.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.934
Well...

37:08.017 --> 37:11.812
{\an3}My daughter definitely
looks like me.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.814
Wow.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.983
Wow. My daughter.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.945
I think that's the first time
I've said it out loud.

37:19.028 --> 37:19.737
{\an1}Pretty heavy.
Yeah.

37:19.820 --> 37:21.864
What do you say
we get outta here

37:21.948 --> 37:23.783
{\an6}and get some
real food, huh?
Uh...

37:23.866 --> 37:26.827
{\an3}No. I-I should get
back upstairs.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.162
{\an1}You sure?

37:28.245 --> 37:29.705
Mmm.

37:29.789 --> 37:33.000
{\an1}All right, I'll take care
of this, Papa.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.002
{\an3}Thanks, Steve,
you're a good man.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.379
See ya, pal.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.217
{\an3}She sure does look
a lot like you.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.511
{\an1}Yeah, she's definitely
a Zuckerman.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.013
How long do you think she's
gonna have to stay in here?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.765
Oh, I don't know.
It's all a blur.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.183
I don't want to think
about it anymore.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.018
Let's talk about something
in the real world.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.688
How was Mardi Gras?
How's Dylan?

37:53.771 --> 37:56.023
Mmm... Mardi
Gras is hot.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.192
Dylan's not.

37:58.275 --> 37:59.944
What do you mean?

38:01.112 --> 38:02.655
We broke up.

38:02.738 --> 38:03.698
You what?

38:03.781 --> 38:05.616
I just got tired of
fighting with him.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.702
And I was always mad.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.079
I don't think it
was meant to last.

38:10.162 --> 38:11.539
Are you okay?

38:13.082 --> 38:17.044
The weird thing is,
I'm better than okay.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.089
Well, what's his name?

38:22.133 --> 38:24.051
Remember when I went on that
retreat with Brandon?

38:25.636 --> 38:26.595
Brandon?

38:26.679 --> 38:29.015
Mm-hmm.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.725
I got him to square dance.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.978
Well, that's further
than I ever got.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.024
What else did you two do?

38:38.107 --> 38:40.067
Not that much.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.069
I mean, we kissed.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.738
There was a full moon.

38:43.821 --> 38:44.905
It was nice.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.198
Nice?

38:46.282 --> 38:47.992
It was better than nice.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.744
Mm-hmm.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.954
Am I nuts?

38:52.038 --> 38:55.916
To be crazy about Brandon Walsh
is not to be nuts.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.419
Especially if he's crazy
about you.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.212
(elevator bell dings)

39:00.296 --> 39:02.089
That part I'm not so sure about.

39:03.007 --> 39:04.216
(chuckles)

39:04.300 --> 39:05.551
Would you feel deserted

39:05.634 --> 39:07.720
{\an3}if I skipped town
for a couple of days?

39:07.803 --> 39:10.056
{\an1}Oh, planning a little visit
to our nation's capital?

39:10.139 --> 39:12.099
(laughs)

39:12.183 --> 39:14.226
(carousel music playing)

39:24.320 --> 39:25.988
{\an3}DAVID:
Hey, Donna.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.573
Thanks a lot, David.

39:27.656 --> 39:28.991
What do you mean?

39:29.075 --> 39:30.659
Where <i> were</i> you all day?

39:30.743 --> 39:31.786
{\an3}I've been around.
Where?

39:31.869 --> 39:34.163
Well, let's see. I was at
the petting zoo with Gary,

39:34.246 --> 39:35.581
{\an1}and then I got
something to eat

39:35.664 --> 39:37.750
and then I went on that
ride that makes you feel

39:37.833 --> 39:39.960
{\an5}like you want
to throw up.
You told me
to meet you

39:40.044 --> 39:42.671
{\an5}at the announcer's booth
after lunch.
Well, I did.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.090
We must've just
missed each other.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.466
{\an1}I even went back
again to see

39:45.549 --> 39:47.134
if I could try
and find you.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.552
{\an3}Yeah, well, you obviously
didn't try very hard.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.012
Look, I'm sorry.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.972
Do you want to go on the Zipper?

39:52.056 --> 39:53.099
I can't now, I'm due back

39:53.182 --> 39:54.600
at the dunk tank
in ten minutes.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.685
Well, then I can
just hang out with you.

39:56.769 --> 39:57.937
Well, what happened to Ariel?

39:58.020 --> 40:00.147
She left hours ago.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.149
{\an1}Come on,
it's a carnival.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.150
I'll buy you a root beer.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.277
Fine.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.668
{\an3}Brandon! You
were terrific.

40:20.751 --> 40:21.836
{\an1}Oh, thanks, man.
Brandon, good speech.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.130
Thanks, guys. I was a little
nervous at the beginning,

40:24.213 --> 40:25.673
{\an1}but I think they liked
what we were saying.

40:25.756 --> 40:26.674
No doubt about it.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.967
Congratulations.
Thanks, man.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.846
Thanks, Chancellor.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.472
{\an3}Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.682
By the way,

40:34.765 --> 40:36.308
have you seen
my errant daughter lately?

40:36.392 --> 40:38.853
Uh...

40:38.936 --> 40:39.854
Yeah. Yeah, actually,

40:39.937 --> 40:41.522
I, uh, I-I saw her earlier.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.231
Where?

40:42.314 --> 40:44.984
J... In the hotel.

40:45.067 --> 40:47.319
She's been so busy running
around from college to college,

40:47.403 --> 40:48.904
{\an1}I haven't talked to
her all day.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.656
If you see her again,
would you please make sure

40:50.739 --> 40:51.991
she knows
about our dinner plans?

40:52.074 --> 40:53.993
Yeah. Sure. Absolutely.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.911
I mean... if I see her.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.747
Which... I probably
won't. Probably.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.583
Lucinda!

41:00.666 --> 41:02.543
Hi.
Hello.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.003
{\an1}LUCINDA:
Good presentation, Brandon.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.004
Thanks.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.840
{\an1}Are you, uh,
staying at the hotel?

41:07.923 --> 41:08.841
Uh... no.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.050
A friend is.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.095
You know they did

41:13.179 --> 41:16.182
a famous study about how people
behave in elevators.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.893
They always stare at the numbers
to avoid eye contact.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.060
Silly me.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.897
I always look at the numbers
to see what floor I'm on.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.648
{\an3}(chuckling)

41:28.152 --> 41:29.695
(elevator bell dings)

41:29.778 --> 41:31.238
Well, our floor's up, Willis.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.240
Yeah. Yeah, yeah...

41:33.324 --> 41:34.617
{\an1}See you later,
gentlemen.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.870
{\an3}Good night,
gentlemen.

41:37.953 --> 41:40.122
{\an1}So, what floor is your
friend staying on?

41:40.998 --> 41:42.750
{\an3}Nine.

41:42.833 --> 41:43.959
Nine?

41:46.462 --> 41:47.546
Funny, that's my floor.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.381
{\an3}(chuckles)

41:49.465 --> 41:50.925
Well, what a
coincidence.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.804
You know, Brandon,

41:55.888 --> 41:58.933
we never did it
in an elevator.

41:59.016 --> 42:02.311
We did it on a
kitchen table.

42:02.394 --> 42:05.606
In the film editing room.

42:05.689 --> 42:09.401
{\an3}In the shower-- a
number of times-- but...

42:09.485 --> 42:13.405
never in an elevator.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.783
Or your hotel room.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.910
(elevator bell dings, door open)

42:17.993 --> 42:22.039
As I recall, we didn't end up on
the best of terms, now, did we?

42:23.874 --> 42:27.628
{\an3}Brandon, there's no reason
why we can't be friends.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.463
And it could be an
awfully long time

42:29.547 --> 42:31.131
{\an3}before our paths
cross again.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.425
{\an1}Well, what did you
have in mind, Lucinda?

42:33.509 --> 42:35.427
Well, we could start
off with room service

42:35.511 --> 42:36.679
and, uh, take
it from there.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.932
Well, that's very tempting, but
even if I wanted to, I can't.

42:40.015 --> 42:40.808
And why not?

42:40.891 --> 42:42.434
Well, for one thing,

42:42.518 --> 42:44.645
{\an3}I'm having dinner with the
Chancellor in an hour...

42:44.728 --> 42:46.313
So that gives
us an hour.

42:46.397 --> 42:50.317
{\an3}Look, Lucinda, I could make
up a lot of excuses here,

42:50.401 --> 42:52.903
{\an3}but the truth is, there's
someone waiting for me.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.405
There is not.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.366
Oh, my God.
You're not kidding.

42:57.449 --> 42:59.827
That's right, I'm not kidding.

43:02.037 --> 43:02.955
{\an3}Hi, Clare.

43:03.038 --> 43:04.290
I think you've met Lucinda.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.167
Hi.
Hi.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.460
{\an3}You know, you
two really

43:08.544 --> 43:10.129
ought to get to know
each other better.

43:10.212 --> 43:11.297
You have a lot in common.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.675
Listen, it's obvious
you two have plans.

43:14.758 --> 43:15.843
{\an1}I'm really sorry
to intrude.

43:15.926 --> 43:16.844
No, it's okay.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.346
Uh, we were
gonna have

43:19.430 --> 43:21.473
dinner with my
father later.

43:21.557 --> 43:23.017
{\an1}Do you want
to join us, or...?

43:24.059 --> 43:25.311
Yeah.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.396
I'd love to.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.032
Can't leave Washington without
visiting the Custis Lee mansion.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.409
BRANDON:
It's too bad the Chancellor

43:40.492 --> 43:41.869
keeps us locked up
in this hotel.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.038
Tomorrow's open
for sightseeing.

43:44.121 --> 43:47.041
{\an6}HARRIMAN:
You must see the
Augustus Tack exhibit

43:47.124 --> 43:48.250
at the Phillips.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.252
Who was Augustus Tack?

43:50.336 --> 43:52.254
He's one of the greatest
American impressionists,

43:52.338 --> 43:54.048
{\an1}although
he's practically unknown

43:54.131 --> 43:55.549
{\an1}because his paintings
are being held

43:55.632 --> 43:57.301
at the estate
of his patron, Duncan Phillips,

43:57.384 --> 43:59.386
{\an1}and they rarely
leave Washington.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.472
What's the matter, Brandon?

44:01.555 --> 44:03.390
Don't you like
Impressionism?

44:04.975 --> 44:08.437
Well, this meal's leaving
a huge impression on me.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.064
{\an3}ARNOLD:
Lewis, what are you having?

44:10.147 --> 44:12.232
{\an6}TRIMBLE:
Oh, I don't know,
I think I'll, uh...

44:12.316 --> 44:15.652
It'll either be the
Chicken Dijonnaise

44:15.736 --> 44:16.904
or the butterfly shrimp.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.405
(chuckles)

44:21.492 --> 44:22.868
Brandon?

44:22.951 --> 44:25.454
{\an3}The shrimp sounds
fabulous, sir.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.289
Fantastic.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.376
{\an4}LUCINDA:
Actually, I was thinking
of going lighter.

44:30.459 --> 44:33.587
Um, a mixed salad and the
oysters on the half shell.

44:33.670 --> 44:36.090
Hmm... not me.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.926
{\an3}I think I'm gonna go
for some red meat.

44:39.009 --> 44:42.346
(clearing throat)

44:42.429 --> 44:46.475
So, uh, exactly where is
the Curtis Lee mansion, sir?

44:46.558 --> 44:48.435
{\an3}Custis Lee.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.188
Custis. Right.

44:57.736 --> 44:59.988
(carousel music playing)

45:00.072 --> 45:00.948
STEVE:
Come on, kid, nice haircut.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.950
Next time tell your mom
to use a smaller bowl.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.451
Oh, so close.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.913
{\an1}Come on, kid,
I'm begging for it here.

45:07.996 --> 45:09.581
{\an1}Come on, your little
brother hit me before.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.999
I was swimming.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.126
There was a Girl Scout here
earlier

45:12.209 --> 45:14.628
who had me in the
water for hours.

45:14.711 --> 45:18.173
Aim, just aim will you,
I'm begging for it here!

45:18.257 --> 45:21.135
Excuse me, thanks.

45:21.218 --> 45:23.095
Oh, he's cute.

45:23.178 --> 45:24.513
Who is?
He is.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.015
{\an1}DYLAN:
What he?

45:27.099 --> 45:28.475
Dylan...

45:28.559 --> 45:30.436
{\an3}You know what,
I think I know him.

45:30.519 --> 45:32.020
Do you want to meet him?

45:32.104 --> 45:33.480
Nah, I can't.
Come on.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.023
Hey, that's right, hey...

45:35.107 --> 45:36.525
What are you...
where you taking her, Bren?

45:39.361 --> 45:41.155
Is Leslie Sumner still here?

45:41.238 --> 45:43.031
Uh, yeah, she just went
to get some change. Why?

45:43.115 --> 45:45.325
'Cause I have one
cute little girl

45:45.409 --> 45:46.994
{\an5}who wants to meet
her brother.
No, I don't.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.454
{\an3}DONNA:
David, cover for me, okay?

45:48.537 --> 45:49.705
{\an3}Sure.

45:49.788 --> 45:52.541
{\an1}Don't worry,
I will be very casual.

45:52.624 --> 45:55.002
Hey, you be good.

45:55.085 --> 45:58.839
All right, guys, now's your
chance to get back at Steve

45:58.922 --> 46:01.633
for everything he's ever
possibly done... or will do.

46:01.717 --> 46:02.843
{\an3}STEVE:
Hey, hey, hey.

46:02.926 --> 46:04.511
Have a little mercy here, okay?

46:04.595 --> 46:05.721
{\an3}Steve, as tempting
as it may be,

46:05.804 --> 46:08.807
{\an3}Dylan and I have
something else in mind.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.143
We do?

46:11.226 --> 46:13.562
(Brenda groans)

46:13.645 --> 46:16.023
{\an1}DYLAN:
Why are we doing this?

46:16.106 --> 46:17.858
{\an3}Because it's a metaphor
for our relationship.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.152
What relationship?

46:20.235 --> 46:21.695
{\an3}The one that we
used to have.

46:21.778 --> 46:23.030
{\an3}The one that went
round and round

46:23.113 --> 46:24.823
and we'd get to
the top and then

46:24.907 --> 46:26.575
{\an3}the bottom would
just drop out.

46:26.658 --> 46:28.035
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

46:28.118 --> 46:31.038
{\an1}And as fate would
have it, here we are

46:31.121 --> 46:32.414
arriving at the top again.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.666
It looks that way.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.543
So what's next, Bren?

46:36.627 --> 46:39.421
London.
As in England?

46:39.505 --> 46:43.383
{\an3}As in the Royal Academy
of Dramatic Arts.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.345
{\an3}Roy Randolph got me into the
summer program over there.

46:46.428 --> 46:47.846
I leave right after finals.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.723
{\an1}Well, you're gonna
love London.

46:49.806 --> 46:50.891
More than Paris?

46:50.974 --> 46:53.894
{\an1}Oh, Bren, nothing can
compare to Paris...

46:53.977 --> 46:56.730
except maybe the
Bonsai Pipeline.

46:56.813 --> 47:00.609
Well, I'm gonna
miss you, Dylan.

47:00.692 --> 47:03.028
{\an1}Well, I'm gonna
miss you, too, Bren.

47:07.866 --> 47:09.910
(indistinct conversations)

47:13.497 --> 47:14.498
{\an3}Leave your
door unlocked.

47:14.581 --> 47:16.583
I'll be up as
soon as I can.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.126
Why is it whenever
you leave town,

47:18.210 --> 47:19.878
you lose all sense
of discipline?

47:19.962 --> 47:20.921
Excuse me, sir?

47:21.004 --> 47:23.090
The food. I haven't eaten
like that in years.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.424
Oh, you Californians.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.426
{\an1}You're so health conscious,
it's appalling.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.594
Leave your door unlocked.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.596
{\an3}It'll take me a sec
to ditch my dad.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.640
Maybe we all should hit the
health club in the morning.

47:31.723 --> 47:33.475
{\an3}What do you
say, Brandon?

47:33.559 --> 47:35.060
About what, sir?

47:35.143 --> 47:36.603
The health club?
In the morning?

47:36.687 --> 47:37.771
Health club.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.606
Right. Good idea.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.149
Listen, everyone,

47:41.233 --> 47:43.026
{\an1}thanks for
a-a wonderful night.

47:43.110 --> 47:44.695
I'm sure I'll never forget it.

47:52.703 --> 47:56.081
{\an1}Excuse me, sir,
is there any way possible

47:56.164 --> 47:58.125
{\an1}I could change
my room for this evening?

47:58.208 --> 47:59.585
{\an3}Why? Is there
a problem, sir?

47:59.668 --> 48:03.463
No, not yet, but I'm afraid
if you don't find me

48:03.547 --> 48:05.007
somewhere else to sleep
there's gonna be.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.471
(bell rings)

48:17.728 --> 48:19.688
Looking a little wet up there,
aren't you, Sanders?

48:21.189 --> 48:22.983
You want a crack at him?

48:23.066 --> 48:23.984
{\an3}No.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.154
You do it for me.

48:27.237 --> 48:29.072
Your wish is my command.

48:32.242 --> 48:33.660
(bell rings)

48:34.453 --> 48:37.748
(bell ringing)

48:39.041 --> 48:41.752
(bell rings)

48:41.835 --> 48:43.670
Sears...

48:43.754 --> 48:45.839
Three more balls, please.

48:45.922 --> 48:47.633
John, I'm hungry.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.009
{\an3}Let's go get
something to eat.

48:49.092 --> 48:49.843
Oh, come on,

48:49.926 --> 48:52.179
don't quit now,
not while you're ahead.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.847
Ah, we've had our fun.

48:53.930 --> 48:56.933
{\an1}Besides, Celeste
is losing interest in you.

48:57.934 --> 48:58.894
Celeste.

49:00.937 --> 49:03.523
You know you're hanging around
with a real sleazeball.

49:03.607 --> 49:07.027
{\an1}Would you give me
one second.

49:19.122 --> 49:21.124
(bell rings)

49:49.486 --> 49:52.572
{\an3}What do you think,
should we wake him up?

49:52.656 --> 49:56.034
{\an1}No. poor baby...
let him sleep.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.745
{\an3}I think we did a pretty
good job of wearing him out.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.455
Ungatokken'll do that.

50:00.539 --> 50:01.748
{\an3}Unga-what?

50:01.832 --> 50:03.875
{\an1}Ungatokken.
It's an Eskimo word.

50:03.959 --> 50:05.794
It means...

50:05.877 --> 50:07.796
"The more the merrier."
Hmm.

50:07.879 --> 50:11.007
{\an3}I'm surprised I've never seen
that on <i> Northern Exposure.</i>

50:11.091 --> 50:12.968
You probably will now.

50:13.051 --> 50:17.097
{\an6}Well, I have one thing to ask
you before we wake him up.
Hmm?

50:17.180 --> 50:18.849
{\an3}What was all that
stuff he was mumbling

50:18.932 --> 50:22.227
about how sex without
love is meaningless?

50:22.310 --> 50:23.603
Oh, you know Brandon.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.772
{\an1}He's totally sold on
the myth of romantic love.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.942
{\an3}Yeah, he's still waiting
for the girl of his dreams

50:29.025 --> 50:31.737
{\an3}to walk through the door
and sweep him off his feet.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.904
What he doesn't realize

50:32.988 --> 50:36.783
{\an1}is that the mating instinct
is just that.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.952
It's an instinct.

50:39.035 --> 50:41.288
My instinct is
we wake him up.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.789
Wait, not like that...

50:42.873 --> 50:46.793
You've got to use
a little finesse.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.215
(knocking on door)

50:54.217 --> 50:56.845
(knocking continues)

50:56.928 --> 50:57.763
Who is it?

50:57.846 --> 51:00.015
Room service.

51:05.937 --> 51:08.815
{\an1}Yeah, man, I didn't order
any room service.

51:08.899 --> 51:10.358
{\an3}I did.

51:10.442 --> 51:12.110
{\an1}Kelly?

51:13.361 --> 51:14.863
Surprise.

51:22.871 --> 51:24.873
{\an5}BRANDON:
<i>How did you find out</i>
<i>what room I was in?</i>

51:24.956 --> 51:27.876
Well, I have my ways.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.961
Sir, will there be
anything else?

51:30.045 --> 51:30.796
No, thanks, that's it.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.380
Do I have to sign something
for you?

51:32.464 --> 51:33.965
No, it's all been taken care of.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.343
Thanks, Michael.

51:36.426 --> 51:40.972
{\an3}I couldn't come
empty-handed.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.849
{\an3}Brandon, I don't want to get
in your way or anything.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.894
I know that you probably have
a really busy schedule today.

51:45.977 --> 51:48.522
{\an1}Oh, yeah, I have a real
busy schedule today.

51:48.605 --> 51:49.981
{\an1}I have to eat
breakfast with you,

51:50.065 --> 51:51.817
{\an1}and then we have
to go sightseeing.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.528
{\an1}Unless of course you're
too tired from your journey.

51:54.611 --> 51:56.780
No. That's what I came for.

51:58.365 --> 52:01.827
At least part of
what I came for.

52:01.910 --> 52:06.832
{\an1}You have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

52:06.915 --> 52:09.960
You have no idea how happy
I am to hear you say that.

52:14.005 --> 52:16.007
{\an1}Wait a second,
that's impossible.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.884
He's got to be staying here.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.096
{\an1}Unless he checked out
in the middle of the night?

52:21.179 --> 52:23.431
Or switched
rooms on us.

52:23.515 --> 52:24.975
{\an1}Yeah, but why
would he do that?

52:28.061 --> 52:31.606
I think we've been had.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.859
{\an3}No, actually,
we haven't.

52:35.986 --> 52:38.822
{\an3}Have you had
breakfast yet?

52:46.955 --> 52:48.915
Hello.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.333
Mom!
Hi, honey.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.043
{\an3}Hey, I didn't expect you
guys till sometime tonight.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.920
{\an1}Well, we didn't want
to get stuck in traffic.

52:54.004 --> 52:55.005
{\an3}You're never going
to believe

52:55.088 --> 52:57.048
what happened to me at
the Mardi Gras last night.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.010
Let me guess...
you won a stuffed animal.

53:00.093 --> 53:01.094
Nope.

53:01.177 --> 53:02.470
I danced with a boy.

53:02.554 --> 53:03.889
You did what?

53:03.972 --> 53:06.266
{\an3}His name is Jeremy,
and he's 14,

53:06.349 --> 53:07.601
and he asked
for my phone number.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.186
Oh, whoa, an older man.

53:11.521 --> 53:12.939
Now we're in trouble.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.442
{\an1}Come on. You can tell me all
about it while we make coffee.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.402
{\an3}I told you.

53:17.485 --> 53:18.945
Thank you.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.072
So, how's married life
treating you?

53:21.156 --> 53:22.991
Not bad. One day down,
the rest of my life to go.

53:23.074 --> 53:24.951
{\an1}Have you thought
any more

53:25.035 --> 53:27.078
about our little
business venture?

53:27.162 --> 53:28.622
Well, I have been
thinking about it,

53:28.705 --> 53:32.042
all weekend, in fact,
and it comes to this,

53:32.125 --> 53:36.755
{\an3}I'm not a greedy person,
but I don't see any reason

53:36.838 --> 53:38.924
{\an3}to cut anybody else
in on the deal.

53:39.007 --> 53:40.800
It's just not
good business

53:40.884 --> 53:42.928
when we can keep
it in the family.

53:43.011 --> 53:44.638
Exactly.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.806
And once we do get
it up and running,

53:46.890 --> 53:49.142
{\an1}maybe we will look around
for some additional capital.

53:49.225 --> 53:51.937
{\an1}By then, we'll be coming
from a position of strength.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.773
I just wish we'd thought of it
before we involved Jim Walsh.

53:54.856 --> 53:56.358
He's not going to
take it very well.

53:56.441 --> 53:57.859
I'll talk to him.

53:57.943 --> 53:59.361
{\an3}Oh, no, I've
gotta do that.

53:59.444 --> 54:02.072
{\an3}I, uh, I've known
that guy a long time.

54:02.155 --> 54:05.951
Look, Dylan, if this isn't
exactly what you want to do...

54:06.034 --> 54:06.993
I know what I'm doing.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.162
Taking care of my family.

54:09.245 --> 54:10.622
If you're sure?

54:10.705 --> 54:13.041
Definitely.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.461
Great.

54:16.544 --> 54:18.505
(carousel music playing)

54:25.887 --> 54:27.889
(band tuning up)

54:34.729 --> 54:36.731
(band tuning up)

54:38.733 --> 54:40.986
Well, what am I
supposed to call him?

54:41.069 --> 54:43.029
Babyface? Mr. Baby? Mr. Face?

54:43.113 --> 54:45.031
{\an3}His real name
is Kenny Edmonds.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.367
{\an1}Oh, great,
that makes it even harder.

54:47.450 --> 54:50.036
Kenny? Mr. Edmonds?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.205
Donna...

54:52.288 --> 54:54.124
{\an3}David, how well do you
know their material?

54:54.207 --> 54:55.834
Pretty well.

54:55.917 --> 54:57.919
{\an3}Well enough to fake it
for sound check?

54:58.003 --> 55:00.046
You're kidding.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.048
{\an3}No, their second
keyboardist is a no-show.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.049
{\an3}Come on.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.010
{\an3}So, Jules, I'm not going
to work with this guy.

55:05.093 --> 55:07.053
{\an1}I know, I know, but what are
we gonna do about tonight?

55:07.137 --> 55:09.055
Kenny, this is David Silver,
the guy I told you about.

55:09.139 --> 55:10.390
{\an6}Hey, David, how
you doing?
Hey.

55:10.473 --> 55:12.017
Look, do you know
"For the Cool in You"?

55:12.100 --> 55:13.018
Do you know how to play that?

55:13.101 --> 55:15.228
Uh, yeah, sure.

55:15.311 --> 55:17.063
{\an3}Then why don't we
just give it a try?

55:17.147 --> 55:18.398
{\an3}Can you try
it right now?

55:18.481 --> 55:19.399
Yeah.

55:19.482 --> 55:20.859
{\an3}Come on.

{\an1}He was in the right place
at the right time.

56:18.249 --> 56:20.043
{\an3}So what are you
doing tonight, man?

56:20.126 --> 56:22.629
{\an1}Uh, well, I'm supposed
to be your emcee.

56:22.712 --> 56:25.131
Well, look, do you know the
rest of my songs and stuff??

56:25.215 --> 56:26.966
Yeah, I know every single song.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.259
Cool. Why don't
you just, uh,

Cool.

56:34.682 --> 56:35.934
Thanks a lot.
Thanks, man.

56:36.017 --> 56:38.144
All right, well,
I'll see you tonight then.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.021
{\an1}I can't believe
this is happening.

56:40.105 --> 56:42.816
{\an3}You were... You <i> are</i>
wonderful, David.

56:47.403 --> 56:49.781
Who is that saucy vixen
drooling all over David?

56:50.740 --> 56:53.118
Go to hell, Steve.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.288
Jealous?

57:09.759 --> 57:12.512
So, what do you think
of Washington, Kel?

57:12.595 --> 57:15.014
{\an6}It's so much more
beautiful than I ever
thought it would be.

57:15.098 --> 57:17.183
You know, President Clinton
went to college here.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.769
Your hero, huh?

57:19.853 --> 57:23.022
Ah... You know, I don't think
I actually have any heroes.

57:23.106 --> 57:24.524
Except maybe my father.

57:24.607 --> 57:28.027
I mean, I like Bill,
but it's not so much

57:28.111 --> 57:30.822
{\an1}the president per se
as the presidency.

57:32.323 --> 57:34.742
{\an1}You know, this is gonna
sound corny, but...

57:34.826 --> 57:36.202
{\an1}when I was riding
in from the airport

57:36.286 --> 57:39.497
{\an1}in the cab, we passed
right by the White House

57:39.581 --> 57:42.208
and we were stopped
at a stoplight.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.877
{\an3}I found myself
getting misty-eyed,

57:43.960 --> 57:47.005
like Jimmy Stewart in
<i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.</i>

57:47.088 --> 57:48.214
I love that movie.

57:48.298 --> 57:49.924
You've seen it?

57:50.008 --> 57:51.885
Yeah.

57:51.968 --> 57:54.637
{\an1}Dylan used to make me watch
a lot of old movies.

57:55.638 --> 57:59.267
{\an3}I knew that name would
come up sooner or later.

58:00.268 --> 58:02.020
Do you think I'm crazy?

58:02.103 --> 58:02.896
Isn't everyone?

58:02.979 --> 58:04.606
No. I'm serious.

58:04.689 --> 58:07.192
Dylan and I split up, and I
didn't even let the dust settle

58:07.275 --> 58:09.444
{\an1}before I got on a plane
to come here and see you.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.237
Well, I'm glad you're here.

58:11.321 --> 58:14.240
{\an3}It's no fun getting
misty-eyed by yourself.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.243
{\an1}Well, you've always
got Lucinda and Clare.

58:17.327 --> 58:19.120
Talk about crazy.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.915
I just can't help thinking,

58:21.998 --> 58:24.250
you and I are such
good friends...

58:24.334 --> 58:25.585
why risk it?

58:25.668 --> 58:27.253
We'll always be friends.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.298
Just friends?

58:30.381 --> 58:31.925
If that's what you want.

58:32.008 --> 58:33.927
I don't know
what I want.

58:34.010 --> 58:38.223
I mean, it's kind of scary.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.934
I don't know if I should
let myself feel the feelings

58:41.017 --> 58:42.852
that I'm starting to feel,

58:42.936 --> 58:45.647
{\an1}think the things
that I'm thinking.

58:50.318 --> 58:52.904
What would Frank Capra
do right now?

58:52.987 --> 58:54.364
Well, I think Frank

58:54.447 --> 58:57.158
would have the guy lean in
and kiss the girl, and...

58:57.242 --> 58:59.661
the camera would pull back
and the music would rise.

58:59.744 --> 59:01.329
{\an1}No. I don't think
that's what he would do.

59:01.412 --> 59:02.622
(dramatic music playing)

59:02.705 --> 59:04.415
You don't?
Mm-mm.

59:04.499 --> 59:06.960
{\an1}I think he would have the girl
lean in and kiss the guy.

59:07.043 --> 59:08.294
Oh, you do, do you?

59:08.378 --> 59:09.671
That's what I think.

59:09.754 --> 59:11.422
{\an3}What kind of woman's
lib stuff is that?

59:11.506 --> 59:14.217
{\an6}(camera shutter clicking)
Hey, come on.
Hey, hey.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.221
(elevator bell dings)

59:19.222 --> 59:21.641
Jesse, you can't spend
all your time here.

59:21.724 --> 59:22.934
I mean, what about finals?

59:23.017 --> 59:24.185
They gave me
an extension.

59:24.269 --> 59:25.687
{\an3}I can't study
right now.

59:25.770 --> 59:26.980
What about Judge Meinor

59:27.063 --> 59:27.981
and the clerkship
in San Francisco?

59:28.064 --> 59:31.234
{\an3}Even if the baby surpasses
all expectations,

59:31.317 --> 59:33.987
she's gonna be here for
weeks, probably months.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.780
{\an3}I couldn't possibly
leave town.

59:35.863 --> 59:38.449
I know.

59:38.533 --> 59:41.244
{\an1}Do you think our lives
will ever be normal again?

59:42.745 --> 59:43.871
Yeah.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.999
Just a different kind of normal.

59:50.753 --> 59:53.840
{\an3}Yeah.

59:53.923 --> 59:56.676
I'm pretty good at this
scrubbing up stuff, huh?

59:56.759 --> 59:58.970
{\an3}Yeah. A little too good.
(monotonous beep)

59:59.053 --> 01:00:01.681
{\an4}WOMAN:
I got a code in here!

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.684
{\an1}Her blood pressure
is 80/60 and dropping.

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.189
WOMAN 2:
It's on its way.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.483
{\an1}We need a
resident! Stat!

01:00:14.068 --> 01:00:17.071

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.493
{\an3}I want you to page the
Anderson parents right now.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.579
Get me an epi.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.831
(indistinct talking)

01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:28.583
{\an1}Paddle?

01:00:28.666 --> 01:00:30.626
{\an1}WOMAN 2:
Clear.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.378
{\an1}I feel guilty
for saying this,

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.298
{\an1}but all I can think is,
thank God it's not Hannah.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:39.093
{\an3}That's the first time
you said her name.

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.889
{\an3}You've never said
Hannah's name before.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:47.643
{\an1}Andrea, I don't
want to lose her.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.774
(sniffling, crying)

01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:55.151
{\an3}It's okay.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.417
Here we go again.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.378
{\an1}Well, we gotta get
this thing cleaned up

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.588
a little bit before
we take it upstairs.

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:18.383
Hey, this is some
impressive dust.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.301
Paris dust, Minnesota dust.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.553
{\an3}Well, it can't go to
London looking like that.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.806
Yeah, if only it
could talk. Right, Mom?

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:27.058
{\an3}So far, Brenda,
this trunk

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:30.770
has seen more miles with <i> you</i>
than it has in my entire life.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.772
Don't sound so melancholy.

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:35.608
You can go anywhere
in the world you want now.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:36.776
Yeah, but I
don't, do I?

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.904
You're the one
who takes those risks.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:46.786
That's been your personality
since the minute you were born.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.788
Mom, you're
embarrassing me.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.289
It's only for a summer.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.666
It's no big deal.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.879
It <i> is</i> a big deal.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.592
(doorbell rings)

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:02.885
{\an1}JIM:
I'll get it!

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.518
Dylan.
Hey, you got a minute?

01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:12.311
Sure. Come on in.

01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:15.148
Come sit down.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.274
Got some good news?

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:18.818
Not exactly, no.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.153
What's the matter?

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.612
Well, Kevin and I

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:22.947
{\an1}have been discussing
the situation

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.449
{\an1}and I sort of
made up my mind--

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:26.617
well, we made
up <i> our</i> minds--

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.619
that we'd like to fund
the project ourselves.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:29.996
What do you mean, "ourselves"?

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:31.831
I mean Kevin and I.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.375
You mean Kevin's brains
and your money.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.294
Listen, Jim, we appreciate
everything you've done for us,

01:02:36.377 --> 01:02:38.796
and we think it's really a hell
of a deal. It's just not what

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.631
we're looking
for right now.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.008
Wait a minute.
You come in here

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.634
on a Sunday
with a harebrained scheme

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:44.635
{\an3}like this?
Jim.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:46.304
Where the hell is Kevin?!

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.389
What are you,
the millionaire messenger boy?

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.975
Okay, I knew you'd
be a little angry.

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:53.561
Angry? This is a professional
embarrassment.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:54.896
Yeah, I'm angry.

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:57.648
Listen, Dylan,

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.025
I know you may not believe this,

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.860
you may not even
understand this right now,

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.529
but you have no idea

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:04.447
{\an3}how this game
is played.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.532
What is to understand?
I mean, your own firm,

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.326
you told me what
a great investment it is.

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:09.869
I've seen the figures.
I'm not stupid.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:10.912
Yeah, those figures

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:12.830
{\an3}have contingencies
built into them.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.165
Big contingencies.

01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:15.625
{\an3}You don't have that
kind of capital.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.002
{\an3}You don't have
letters of credit.

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:19.045
{\an3}You don't have
relationships with banks.

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.546
What are you thinking about?

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.798
{\an1}I just wish you wouldn't
take this all so personally.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.550
Well, how else am I
supposed to take it?

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.427
You sat in that room
in good faith.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:28.012
I brought you into this deal,
Jim.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:28.930
There are no guarantees,
you know that.

01:03:29.013 --> 01:03:30.681
That's my money in there.
If you can't...

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:32.391
Hold it right there.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.185
Every time I give you
advice you don't like,

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.728
you threaten to fire me,
but not this time.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.063
This time, I'm firing you.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.397
Excuse me?

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.398
{\an3}As of 9:00

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.234
tomorrow morning,
you can walk into any bank

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.319
in this town and do whatever
you damn well please

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.946
with your money, because
you are no longer my client.

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:46.572
You're on your own.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.407
Well, it's about time.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.909
I agree.

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:01.254
(carousel music playing)

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.130
STEVE:
Step right up! Step right up!

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.091
Test your skill and your
strength against one of

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.093
{\an3}the KEG House gladiators.
Who's next?

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.761
What do you say, Celeste?

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.806
Don't you think it's time
Steve took another mud bath?

01:04:11.889 --> 01:04:13.641
Oh, John...

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:15.810
{\an1}Haven't you had
enough fun?

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:17.061
No.

01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:18.604
Forget it Sears.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.064
Your money's no good here.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.315
What, are you, crazy?

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:23.401
{\an3}It's green just like
everybody else's. Take it.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:25.194
I can't watch this.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.739
{\an3}I know what you're
doing, Sears.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.116
{\an3}You're using Celeste
to get back at me.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.742
No, actually I'm not.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:33.452
I'm using Celeste 'cause
she's good in the sack.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.997
Come on, you want to fight?
I paid my five bucks. Let's go.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.039
Five bucks ain't enough, man.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.416
What do you say we up the ante?

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:40.126
Name your price.
Okay, If I win,

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:42.587
{\an4}you stay away
from her.
Oh, how
chivalrous of you.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.964
You're a regular knight in
shining armor, aren't you?

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.966
Is it a bet?

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.510
Sure. It's a bet.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.762
Now, what do I get if I win?

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.180
I know.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.974
I knock you in the pit of mud

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.434
and you resign
from the KEG House.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:58.811
What's the matter?
I give up Celeste,

01:04:58.894 --> 01:04:59.812
{\an1}you give up
the KEG House.

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.939
Sounds fair to me.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:04.108
Those are the
stakes, Steve.

01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:06.569
Take 'em or leave 'em.

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:11.991
(carousel music playing)

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:18.122
(laughing)

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.171
{\an1}Hey, Celeste.
Hi.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.964
Hi.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.467
What's the matter?

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:31.385
Oh, John and Steve are about
to go at it in the mud pit,

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.179
and I just don't share
their taste for blood.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:36.057
{\an6}Well, how long have
you been going out
with John Sears?

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.350
{\an3}CELESTE:
A couple weeks.

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.851
He came into the store one day,

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:41.228
and we started talking,
and one thing led to the next.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.689
So you don't really
know him that well?

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.108
No, not that well.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.694
{\an6}Well, do you mind
if we fill you in on
the real John Sears?

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.571
What are you talking about?

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.782
Come on.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.494
(grunting)

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:02.708
How long has this been going on?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.377
Ten minutes at least.

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.684
Are either of you guys very shy?

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.727
What do you mean, shy?

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.646
I have an idea.

01:06:31.862 --> 01:06:34.407
Don't you think
that's a little mean?

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.867
It's perfect.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:38.577
Oh, John?

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.247
Now.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.089
{\an3}(laughing)

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.633

{\an1}You didn't tell anyone
you were coming here, did you?

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.189
Only Andrea.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.317
She gave us her blessing.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.027
Well that's one down.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.862
(kisses)

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.198
{\an1}I'm afraid we're gonna
give a lot of people

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.033
a whole lot to talk about.

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:45.578
{\an1}Unless of course this
is just a lost weekend.

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.750
No.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.920
I like being
in your world, Brandon.

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:54.004
I want to stay in it.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:56.881
Well, you're welcome to stay
as long as you want.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.843
Thank you.

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:03.555
I can't believe that
you're actually gonna meet

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.850
the President of the United
States tomorrow morning.

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.894
I want you to be there with me.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.895
I want to have you
in the Rose Garden.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.022
No, I couldn't.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:13.732
What would I wear?

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.067
You'll think
of something.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.863
Oh, there's just one problem.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:20.948
What?

01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:22.867
Security clearance.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:28.872
Hold on a sec.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:31.250
What are you doing?

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:34.002
Hi, Chancellor Arnold please.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:39.966
Hi, Chancellor Arnold.
It's Brandon.

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:42.219
I hope I'm not waking you up.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.929
Good.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.307
Listen, uh,
I have a small problem.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.058
Do you remember Kelly Taylor?

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:52.604
Right, yeah, well,

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.689
she's in Washington.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:55.900
She wasn't sure she was gonna
be able to make it,

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:57.276
but things worked out.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.321
{\an1}Yeah, actually, that's
exactly why I'm calling.

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:01.947
{\an1}Do you think
we can get it done?

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.909
Great, thanks.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.869
All right, good night.

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.080
You're in.
Mm.

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.124
{\an1}Unless of course you've been
convicted of a felony.

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.835
{\an5}You haven't,
have you?
No, not yet.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:15.920
Good.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.922
Brandon, I adore you.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.513
(carousel music playing)

01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:28.307
{\an6}MAN:
All right, let's
wrap this thing up.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.100
Last one out of
here is buying.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:30.893
Excuse me.
Yeah?

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:32.478
{\an1}Have you seen
David Silver anywhere?

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.979
{\an1}He's the guy who played
on the keyboards?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.105
{\an3}Right, yeah,
I saw him

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.814
just a couple
minutes ago.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.983
{\an3}He was hanging
with Ariel.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.944
{\an3}You know,
the publicist?

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:41.612
Yeah, I know.

01:10:41.695 --> 01:10:43.781
Look, did you happen
to see where he went?

01:10:43.864 --> 01:10:45.991
Yeah, they're either
in the dressing rooms

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:49.286
{\an3}or they're out in one of
the limos headed somewhere.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.331
Bren, you don't think David

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.958
{\an1}would've left
without me, do you?

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.167
Donna, of course not.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.503
{\an3}Look, I'm gonna go check
the dressing rooms.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.004
You check the limos, okay?

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.547
Okay, I'll meet you out there.

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:06.887
Can I help you?

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:10.015
{\an1}Yeah, uh, have you
seen Ariel and David Silver--

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.684
he played in the band?

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:14.186
Oh, yeah, yeah, you came to the
right place, right over there.

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.355
There. Okay, thanks.
Sure.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.197
{\an3}DONNA:
David?

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.032
Who's that?

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.283
{\an1}DAVID:
It's Donna.

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.661
What-what am I gonna do?

01:11:30.744 --> 01:11:32.871
{\an1}I don't know,
don't look at me.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.081
(knocking on glass)
David, open up.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.336
Uh... (chuckles) hi.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.879
Hi. I was looking for you.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.006
Well, you found me.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.716
Well, what are you doing
in there?

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.051
I'm just hanging
out in the limo.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.345
Open the door, it's locked.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:51.015
Oh, okay.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.108
David...

01:12:02.526 --> 01:12:04.194
Hi.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.114
Oh, my God...

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.498
{\an3}Oh, my God!

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.084
Donna, I can explain.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:19.960
{\an1}There's nothing
to explain.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:23.213
I understand.
I understand everything!

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:24.673
Donna...

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.718
Donna! Donna, wait!

01:12:42.983 --> 01:12:47.446
You and Kelly just kept telling
me not to be jealous...

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:50.282
that I had nothing
to worry about.

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:53.952
Yeah, nothing to worry about.

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.121
Shh. It's okay.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.792
How can he do it?

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:03.003
{\an3}God, I don't even know
why I'm asking that.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:06.381
I know why he did it.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:08.008
{\an1}Donna, if you
could have known

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.135
{\an1}that David would sleep
with someone else,

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.138
would that have changed your
mind about sleeping with him?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:16.975
No.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:21.313
{\an3}I just thought we
were so happy.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:24.149
{\an3}I thought he really
loved me, Bren.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.986
God, I was such an idiot.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.155
I hate him.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.283
How could he do this to me?

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:37.162
I thought that he understood....

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.082
understood what I wanted,
how I felt.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:47.798
I mean, the fact that he hadn't
slept with anyone either...

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:52.761
{\an3}made it like such a
special bond between us.

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:58.308
{\an3}I mean, I guess in some ways,
it's what held us together.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:02.187
And now...

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:06.984
I don't know, maybe I should
just go out and do it, too.

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:08.193
No.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.904
You just want what we all want.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:13.157
Someone to love
who loves us back.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.701
{\an3}I don't know what
I want anymore.

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:19.621
I mean, even if I do
forgive David,

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:24.543
it'll never be the same.

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.671
He will always want
what I can't give him.

01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:32.050
You have to have the courage to
stick to what you believe in.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.719
{\an3}I don't know
if I can.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.555
I don't want to be lonely.

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:40.225
You won't be lonely.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.853
You're beautiful and smart.

01:14:42.936 --> 01:14:45.063
No, I'm not.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.065
Yes, you are.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.235
And there are plenty of guys
out there for you.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.321
Virgins?

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:56.241
At least a few...

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.118
Well, according
to Oprah, anyway.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.205
(laughing)

01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:06.877
Thanks, Bren.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:11.089
You're my best friend.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.593
I'll always be here for you.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:17.012
No, you won't.

01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:18.931
You're going to England.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.349
Not for another week.

01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.559
{\an1}Besides, by the time
I'm leaving,

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:26.605
I'm sure you're gonna feel
a lot different about all this.

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.899
I hope so.

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:32.361
Here.

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:34.071
You sleep with Mr. Pony tonight.

01:15:34.154 --> 01:15:36.949
He'll make you feel all better.

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.034
Thank you.

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.079
I love you.

01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:44.081
I love you, too.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:55.300
There you go, sweetie,
that's better.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.010
Good morning.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.053
{\an3}Big day.

01:15:58.136 --> 01:15:59.304
Tough day.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.222
How's she doing?

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:03.433
{\an3}Fine. She gained another
ounce last night.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:05.060
{\an1}Good girl.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.145
I don't know how I'm
gonna leave without her.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.439
{\an1}Don't worry, we'll
take good care of her.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:12.109
{\an1}And we'll be here
every day.

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:14.444
All day.

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:17.239
You're going to have to tough
some of this out

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:18.490
on your own, Hannah.

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.826
But that's what life's
all about.

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:24.329
{\an3}Listen to your mommy.
She's very wise.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.331
{\an1}She's a strong
little girl.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.542
I have a very good
feeling about her.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.048
{\an3}Oh, we have a present
for you, Hannah.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:36.133
Oh, Hannah, look.

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:37.384
Your very own name tag.

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:40.721
{\an1}Your very own,
very long nametag.

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:42.973
{\an5}(whispering):
It's the biggest name tag
in the nursery.

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:50.897
Jesse, I can't leave
the hospital without her.

01:16:50.981 --> 01:16:53.066
Yes, you can.

01:16:57.904 --> 01:16:59.239
I love you, Hannah.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:02.159
{\an3}JESSE:
I love you, too.

01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:05.162
And we'll be back, okay?

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:14.046
{\an5}REPORTER:
The national student task force
on education is convened

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:16.757
here in Washington this weekend
to present their findings

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.176
to a bipartisan
congressional committee...

01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:21.845
Do you think
we'll be able to see him?

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:22.971
I don't know, honey.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.389
{\an1}There's a lot of
people in the crowd.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.223
There he is.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.934
CINDY:
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:29.895
{\an3}Our son, at
the White House,

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.730
{\an3}about to meet the President
of the United States.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.273
{\an1}I don't think
any other mother

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:36.568
could be as proud
as I am right now.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.528
Except for Steven Spielberg's
mom on Oscar night.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.907
Well, okay, maybe her.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.784
Here comes the President.

01:17:43.867 --> 01:17:45.535
(applause)

01:17:47.954 --> 01:17:51.625
Good afternoon.
Please be seated.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.878
{\an5}CLINTON:
Today we know
that a good future...

01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:56.922
I don't know
if I'll ever have a son.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.591
But if I don't,
I'll tell you,

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:02.552
{\an5}Brandon will
do just fine.
(blows raspberries)

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.472
All our kids need competence
in math and science

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.100
and advanced problem solving.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.143
Well, we got friends
in high places now.

01:18:10.227 --> 01:18:11.311
{\an3}DYLAN:
I don't know, Steve.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.063
Anybody who donates $100,000

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:14.231
{\an1}to the presidential
campaign fund

01:18:14.314 --> 01:18:15.607
{\an1}gets to shake
the president's hand.

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.943
{\an3}Big difference--
our boy earned it.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.945
{\an3}DYLAN:
Yep, sure did.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:23.156
{\an1}Speaking of earning, I've got
an appointment at the bank.

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:25.534
STEVE:
Hey!

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:26.952
I could have sworn
I just saw Kelly Taylor.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.161
{\an3}Where?

01:18:28.245 --> 01:18:30.455
{\an1}On TV,
in the audience.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.251
{\an3}Now, what would Kelly
be doing in Washington?

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:36.044
REPORTER:
...been looking forward to--

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.880
shaking the hand of the
President of the United States,

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:43.343
something they'll remember
for the rest of their lives.

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.763
(applause)

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:08.702
Okay...

01:19:08.785 --> 01:19:11.746
{\an3}If you'll both
sign right here.

01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:13.623
Here you go.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:18.753
There you go.

01:19:24.968 --> 01:19:26.094
Thank you very much.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.471
That's it?

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:28.513
That's it.
If you wait right here,

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:29.723
I'll get the transfer underway.

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:31.016
All right.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:33.768
Well, all right.

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.061
I guess we're partners.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:38.106
{\an3}Hey, this calls for
more than a handshake.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.237
{\an3}All right.

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.826
{\an3}So, you gonna head
down to Orange County,

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.911
take a look at
that property?

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:52.245
{\an1}No reason
to slow down now.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.039
{\an3}That's true.
So what do you think,

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:55.749
I'll go down with you
and we'll have a look?

01:19:55.832 --> 01:19:57.876
{\an1}No, nah, there's no need.
If it looks promising,

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.419
{\an5}I'll give you a call,
we'll meet later.
All right.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.046
Give Erica a kiss
for me, will ya?

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.672
{\an5}I'll do it.
All right.
Drive safe.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:03.965
Take care.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.080
Well?

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:36.581
It's done.

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.084
Are we packed?

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.461
Yup.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.713
Now all we have to do
is deal with Erica.

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:48.051
And I believe we have
a little withdrawal to make.

01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:50.595
A small one.

01:20:57.435 --> 01:20:59.771
Donna, I don't know
what else there is to say.

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:01.606
{\an1}Well, there's
nothing else to say.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:03.775
So, why don't you just pack
your things and leave me alone.

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:05.902
{\an1}Look, I know this is
probably the end of us.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:07.779
{\an1}I just hope one day
you'll be able to forgive me.

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:09.114
{\an3}Yeah, well don't
count on it.

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.949
Come on, Donna,
I tried to be faithful.

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.909
I tried as hard as I could,
but it was right there.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.661
It was right in front of me,
I couldn't say no.

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:16.079
Well, now that
you've done it,

01:21:16.162 --> 01:21:17.539
{\an3}you'll just have to live
with that, won't you, David?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:22.002
Look, you may not believe me,
but I really am sorry.

01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:23.962
Just tell me one thing.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:26.506
Last night in the limousine,
was that your first time?

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:28.091
{\an1}Donna.
Answer me!

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:30.093
Was that your first time?

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:34.973
No, it wasn't.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.142
I didn't think so.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.310
But only with her.

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.562
Donna, please, I'm sorry.

01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.647
{\an3}No, you're just sorry
about one thing

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.940
and that's that
you got caught.

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:45.817
{\an3}Now get out and don't
ever come back!

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.111
Donna...
Get out!

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.289
(door closes)

01:21:59.372 --> 01:22:01.458
(crying)

01:22:06.379 --> 01:22:08.673
{\an5}(over P.A.):
At this time,
Air France flight 106...

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.133
ERICA:
I still don't understand

01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:11.676
why we couldn't say good-bye
to Dylan.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.637
{\an6}SUZANNE:
I told you, I said
good-bye for us.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.347
We're just going to
be gone for a week.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:16.848
Then why couldn't I stay
with him?

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.391
He has finals.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:21.394
{\an1}Erica, look,
I am really sorry.

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:23.688
{\an1}I know this must be difficult
for you to deal with,

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.358
but you are going
to love Brazil.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.692
I've been there.
It's beautiful.

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.527
It's winter.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.321
{\an1}It's beautiful in Brazil
in the wintertime.

01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:33.198
And this is such
a great opportunity

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.116
for your mom, and for me,

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.077
and for Dylan.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.119
It's much cheaper

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:41.373
to run a laboratory in Brazil
than it is here.

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.333
But if we don't get there
by tomorrow,

01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:45.251
we could lose it all, hon.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:47.879
Erica, we'll call Dylan
as soon as we get there.

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.714
{\an1}I don't want
to live in Brazil.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.425
{\an3}Who said anything about
living in Brazil?

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.843
{\an3}Just because
the lab's there,

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:55.720
{\an3}doesn't mean we have
to live there.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.681
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.725
Honey, you go to the bathroom
on the plane.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:03.853
I can't wait.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.271
Go ahead and take her.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.567
I'll wait here.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:11.903
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:12.904
I just didn't understand.

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:13.905
I know.
It's okay.

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:16.658
Just go to the bathroom.
Everything will be fine.

01:23:22.038 --> 01:23:23.456
Are you okay, honey?

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.582
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.084
You don't have to wait for me.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.419
I'm not a little girl.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.045
Okay.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:30.422
I'll be right outside,
all right?

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.507
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.724
Do you have the
boarding passes?

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:42.809
Yeah.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.396
Is everything okay?

01:23:46.479 --> 01:23:48.106
{\an3}Fine. She doesn't
have a clue.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.607
How can you say that?

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.775
{\an1}She was kicking
and screaming

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.110
{\an5}the whole way
down here.
Kevin...

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.653
I know what I'm doing.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.780
{\an3}I didn't spend the last eight
months setting up this scam

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.866
to have it fall
apart on us now.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.452
I know, I know, you're right.

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.746
I'm just a little nervous.

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:04.789
Well, just relax.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:09.085
{\an3}And thank me for making
you a very rich man.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:39.824
{\an5}(over P.A.):
At this time, KLM Flight
Worldwide to Brazil

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.327
will begin boarding
first-class passengers

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.579
and passengers traveling
with small children

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:47.582
at Gate 55.

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.336
I don't know...
Nat, I don't know.

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:52.962
I haven't talked to Suzanne
since last night.

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:55.965
But I can't believe
she didn't call you.

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:58.051
Well, if you need help,
call me and I'll come down.

01:24:58.134 --> 01:24:59.719
No, I will.

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:00.887
(doorbell rings)

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:01.846
Nat, somebody's at the door.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.682
Okay, yeah, I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.814
Yeah. Hey.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:11.981
{\an3}Hey, Dylan.
Can I come in?

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:13.525
Uh, sure.

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.235
{\an3}What's up?

01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:18.571
Well, I was packing
my bags for London,

01:25:18.655 --> 01:25:20.532
{\an1}and I realized
there was something

01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:21.991
{\an1}I had to do
before I left.

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:23.701
{\an3}But you don't leave
for another week, Bren.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.745
I know, but what happens
in this week

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:27.372
could change
the rest of my life.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.833
What's with all
the melodrama?

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.000
{\an1}Sorry.

01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:32.377
I just needed to talk to you.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.003
I mean, I figured that
you're the only person

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:34.838
who would understand.

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:36.548
What?

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:40.218
I was with my parents this
morning watching Brandon on TV.

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:42.387
{\an4}I saw it.
I mean, there was
my brother,

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:45.515
shaking hands with the President
of the United States.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.352
You should have seen
my parents, Dylan.

01:25:49.435 --> 01:25:51.938
{\an1}There was such pride
in their eyes.

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:54.232
I've never seen them
look at me like that, ever.

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.733
Well, Bren...

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.568
The only time

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:57.902
{\an1}I've ever felt anything
close to that

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.863
was when I was on stage.

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:02.073
And then, it wasn't just
my parents, you know,

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.576
it was like a whole audience
applauding me.

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:07.078
I want it, Dylan.

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:08.872
That's why I'm going to London.

01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:11.040
I understand.

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:12.000
I knew you would.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:15.003
You always understand me.

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.256
You believe in me, don't you?

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:21.217
Yeah. I do.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:26.931
Dylan, I love you.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:30.310
{\an1}I've never stopped
loving you.

01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:32.854
And I know now I never will.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.524
I'll applaud you from afar.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:40.445
I want more than your applause.

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:46.784
I won't be gone forever, Dylan.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.745
Give me something
to come back to.
