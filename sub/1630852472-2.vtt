00:10.244 --> 00:13.278
<i>[woman] It felt wonderful
to have a family.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:16.382
The house brought it

<i>[narrator] ...find themselves

<i>[narrator] ...when

<i>[Sandra] I grew up

01:15.810 --> 01:17.009
Lived here all my life.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.745
<i>[Isidro] I was born in Mexico.</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:21.447
My parents
brought me to Chicago.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.349
I fell in love
with the city, you know?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.691
<i>[narrator] Just blocks
from Lake Michigan,</i>

01:32.693 --> 01:36.929

This is going to be great.

<i>[Isidro] We saved a little money
and put our money together.</i>

01:42.837 --> 01:46.472
What attracted me was
the yard, the space.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.373
I always love a space.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.210
<i>[Sandra] It's actually
a three-story,</i>

01:51.212 --> 01:53.178
<i>with an apartment
upstairs to rent.</i>

01:53.180 --> 01:55.781
It was intended
for the family to live

01:55.783 --> 01:58.817
on the main floor and a rental
on the second floor.

01:58.819 --> 02:02.855
<i>[narrator] But although Sandra
should be celebrating her new home,</i>

02:02.857 --> 02:07.025
<i>from day one,
she has an uneasy feeling.</i>

02:11.764 --> 02:13.832
<i>[Sandra] I just never felt
comfortable in that house.</i>

02:13.834 --> 02:15.667
<i>It just didn't appeal to me.</i>

02:29.115 --> 02:31.049
[suspenseful music playing]

02:44.998 --> 02:46.331
- [Isidro] Boo!
- [gasps]

02:48.034 --> 02:49.501
Why are you so scared?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.570
- It's just me.
- I know. I...

02:52.639 --> 02:53.939
This house.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.043
Something just
feels off about it.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.946
[Isidro] We talked about this.
The house is going to pay itself

03:00.948 --> 03:03.382
once we rent
the apartment upstairs.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.450
This is our investment.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.786
It's for us,
it's for our future.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.887
I know.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.957
I just feel like someone's
watching me all the time.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.159
I know it sounds crazy.

03:16.396 --> 03:17.462
Ooh.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.799
[Sandra] He just told me
just to ignore it and just,

03:20.801 --> 03:23.468
if I felt uneasy,
just to say a prayer.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.628
<i>[narrator] As the weeks go by,
Sandra works</i>

03:49.630 --> 03:52.364
<i>on getting the property
ready for renters.</i>

04:03.876 --> 04:08.547
<i>But it appears the upper
apartment is already occupied.</i>

04:10.383 --> 04:12.985
- Hey!
- I saw this lady coming down the stairs.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.854
She was dressed
in all black garb.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.956
It scared me, because
there was nobody up there.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.157
There was no renters.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.462
<i>And then she was gone.</i>

04:23.464 --> 04:27.332
<i>And I was startled, because
I thought, "Who's up there?"</i>

04:31.838 --> 04:33.005
She was just startled.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.508
When she told me that,
I told her I'd never seen her.

04:41.914 --> 04:46.485
<i>[narrator] Soon, Isidro won't be
able to deny something is amiss.</i>

04:49.989 --> 04:54.092
<i>[Isidro] I was actually in the
kitchen doing some cooking...</i>

04:57.063 --> 04:59.097
[voices whispering]

05:04.270 --> 05:07.773
<i>And all of a sudden,
I heard some whispering.</i>

05:07.775 --> 05:09.341
[voice whispering]

05:12.011 --> 05:14.012
They kind of
quieted down a little bit,

05:14.014 --> 05:16.381
but the whispering didn't stop.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.220
<i>I couldn't understand
what they were saying.</i>

05:22.222 --> 05:24.256

05:38.137 --> 05:39.671
[eerie music playing]

06:05.998 --> 06:10.202
<i>I could not explain it. I
didn't quite understand it.</i>

06:17.777 --> 06:22.147
<i>[narrator] Not wanting to
scare his wife, Isidro tells no one.</i>

06:33.192 --> 06:35.026
<i>[Sandra] I came home from work.</i>

06:41.234 --> 06:43.368
<i>The front door was open.</i>

06:43.370 --> 06:46.004
<i>We never keep anything open,
everything's always locked.</i>

06:46.006 --> 06:47.973
We live in Chicago,
it's kind of an old habit.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.608
You have to lock
everything behind you.

06:54.447 --> 06:58.283
<i>That's when I got scared thinking,
you know, "Somebody's here."</i>

06:59.952 --> 07:01.253
<i>The windows were open.</i>

07:01.255 --> 07:03.622
<i>Everything was open.
Even the back door was open.</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:11.296
<i>I just started closing the
windows and closing the doors.</i>

07:14.901 --> 07:17.002
[suspenseful music playing]

07:33.019 --> 07:35.187
<i>I looked through every room,
there was nobody there.</i>

07:38.825 --> 07:40.425
[phone dialing]

07:44.797 --> 07:46.932
Isidro, did you
come home from work

07:46.934 --> 07:48.800
and open all the windows
and the doors?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.136
<i>[Sandra] And then he said,
"No, I'm on my way home."</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:55.006
<i>At that point,
I was feeling desperate.</i>

07:55.008 --> 07:58.143
Okay. I'll see you soon.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.214
Hurry.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.184
<i>I just wanted peace in my house.</i>

08:08.921 --> 08:12.624
<i>[Isidro] Back in Mexico,
when I was a little kid,</i>

08:12.626 --> 08:14.593
<i>I grew up in a haunted house.</i>

08:15.528 --> 08:18.096
I grew up hearing those things

08:18.098 --> 08:22.834
and seeing things
out of the ordinary.

08:22.836 --> 08:27.105
<i>I knew there was something
definitely going on in this house.</i>

08:28.207 --> 08:30.141
I did not grow up
in a home like that,

08:30.143 --> 08:34.212
so for me to move into
my home and experience

08:34.214 --> 08:37.949
all these supernatural things,
I was uncomfortable with it.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.185
<i>And I was
thinking of our future.</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:43.588
When we did have kids, I didn't want
them going through the same thing.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.960
<i>[narrator] Believing that
their home might have a ghost,</i>

08:48.962 --> 08:51.930
<i>the Nunos contact a local priest</i>

08:51.932 --> 08:54.933
<i>who agrees to come over
and bless the home.</i>

08:54.935 --> 08:56.234
[priest] I call the archangel.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.603
Defend us in battle.

09:00.873 --> 09:06.011
Be our defense against the
wickedness and snares of the Devil.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.215
<i>[narrator] The blessing
appears to work.</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:12.951
<i>The house is quiet.</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:16.888
<i>And soon, Sandra and Isidro
receive a blessing of their own,</i>

09:16.890 --> 09:19.558
<i>when Sandra becomes pregnant
with twins.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:22.727
<i>A boy and a girl.</i>

09:22.729 --> 09:28.300
<i>Sadly, three months into the
pregnancy, the boy twin miscarries.</i>

09:30.336 --> 09:33.371
<i>[Sandra] It was sad,
but I was very happy</i>

09:33.373 --> 09:35.774
<i>that my daughter
was still surviving.</i>

09:35.776 --> 09:37.442
It was the most joyous
moment of my life

09:37.444 --> 09:39.210
when I was holding my daughter.

09:39.212 --> 09:43.048
<i>[narrator] Isidro and Sandra
name their baby Sabrina.</i>

09:44.016 --> 09:46.051
<i>Three years later,

09:46.053 --> 09:48.787
<i>with a second daughter, Shannon.</i>

09:48.789 --> 09:52.090
<i>[Sandra] It felt wonderful
to have a family.</i>

09:52.092 --> 09:55.060
<i>And the house
brought it all together.</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:03.635
<i>[narrator] As the years go by,
their home is a happy one...</i>

10:03.637 --> 10:09.407
<i>until the day little Sabrina
receives an unexpected visitor.</i>

10:20.252 --> 10:23.388
I've never spoken
about this to anyone.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.028
[eerie music playing]

10:39.138 --> 10:40.538
[creaking]

10:47.947 --> 10:50.248
[spectral female voice] Hello.

10:54.353 --> 10:57.622
<i>[Sabrina] I remember the hairs
on the back of my neck stood up.</i>

11:09.802 --> 11:12.337
[spectral female voice] Hello.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.150
[eerie music playing]

11:37.263 --> 11:38.963
Hello?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.501
<i>[Sabrina] I was just
staring down there.</i>

11:44.770 --> 11:46.538
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>

11:53.913 --> 11:56.081
[spectral female voice
speaking louder] Hello.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.286
<i>[Sabrina] My first instinct
was to run</i>

12:01.288 --> 12:03.354
<i>and just hide under the covers.</i>

12:04.990 --> 12:07.125
I was just scared.

12:08.027 --> 12:09.761
<i>I just didn't know
what had happened.</i>

12:09.763 --> 12:14.132
<i>I was confused, so I just... I
didn't mention anything at the time.</i>

<i>[narrator] Sandra's mother
moves into the apartment upstairs</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:21.106
<i>to help with the girls.</i>

12:23.976 --> 12:27.112
<i>[Sandra] My girls
always called her Huela.</i>

12:27.114 --> 12:31.182
Huela is an abbreviation
<i>in Spanish. It's Abuela.</i>

12:31.184 --> 12:34.886
But they couldn't pronounce
it, <i>so it became Huela.</i>

12:34.888 --> 12:38.123
<i>[Sabrina] My Huela, she was
like my second mother.</i>

12:38.125 --> 12:41.059
<i>I looked up to her.
I was very close to her.</i>

12:42.294 --> 12:45.396
<i>My Huela was religious.
She was Catholic.</i>

12:47.733 --> 12:51.503
<i>She always thought that,
you know, praying</i>

12:51.505 --> 12:55.473
<i>and having faith, it would make
a difference. A big difference.</i>

12:58.477 --> 13:00.311
It's so beautiful.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.515
<i>Precioso.</i>

13:03.517 --> 13:05.150
<i>Precioso?</i>

13:06.018 --> 13:07.519
<i>Preciosa.</i>

13:09.088 --> 13:13.158
<i>I would go see my Huela
for comfort,</i>

13:13.160 --> 13:16.361
or just if I was having
a bad day, I would go up there

13:16.363 --> 13:19.063
<i>and it would be... it would
be all better. [chuckles]</i>

13:50.630 --> 13:52.530
<i>Huela?</i>

13:52.532 --> 13:55.667
<i>[Sabrina] I was confused,
because she wasn't saying anything.</i>

14:00.039 --> 14:01.105
<i>Huela?</i>

14:10.216 --> 14:11.416
<i>Huela?</i>

14:14.887 --> 14:16.187

14:16.989 --> 14:18.256
<i>Huela?</i>

14:26.899 --> 14:29.234
<i>[Sabrina] I looked over
to my right.</i>

That's when I saw my actual
grandmother sleeping in bed.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.943
<i>I was extremely terrified.</i>

14:38.945 --> 14:40.311

15:02.735 --> 15:05.136
<i>[Sabrina] It looked like
a replica of my grandmother.</i>

15:05.138 --> 15:09.874
Just had black eyes, and it just
made this loud noise, like a scream.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.109
[panting]

15:11.310 --> 15:12.610
[banging]

15:16.849 --> 15:19.150

<i>And no one woke up.</i>

15:21.253 --> 15:23.454
<i>It was very terrifying.</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:29.027
It was just very traumatizing,
and it's hard to talk about it.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.830
<i>[narrator] She keeps it
to herself,</i>

15:32.832 --> 15:35.800
<i>never telling

<i>[Sabrina] I didn't
say anything to anybody.</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:41.072
<i>I was still in shock
of what had happened.</i>

[Shannon] Wake up, Sabrina.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.917
Shannon! You scared me!

That's what little sisters
are for. Come on, get up.

Hey, give me that back!

There she is, the queen
herself, Sabrina Nuno.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.319
You're so dumb.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.656
My family was
pretty happy growing up.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.890
<i>Pretty normal.</i>

16:32.892 --> 16:34.092
[Sabrina] Okay, listen.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.094
Regular hide-and-seek rules,
except you, the seeker,

16:36.096 --> 16:38.029
- is only allowed to find me by video.
- Okay.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.098
We were very busy
with our lives.

16:40.100 --> 16:44.669
And we were into
the daily routines of life.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.339
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

Come on, I found you.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.063
<i>[Shannon] I saw somebody
walking, so I started calling out,</i>

17:29.882 --> 17:32.216
<i>When we looked at it,
it was a shadow.</i>

<i>Form of a man.</i>

17:37.222 --> 17:38.356
What is that?

I don't know.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.293

<i>[Sabrina] I feel like it was
very traumatizing,</i>

17:49.936 --> 17:52.603

what was going on.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.939
<i>[Shannon] I didn't tell anyone,</i>

<i>[Shannon] I was really scared.</i>

18:25.638 --> 18:30.108

<i>To this day, I have no idea

20:28.193 --> 20:31.629
Yeah. We have heard

<i>[Sabrina] My mom did believe

20:36.970 --> 20:40.304
We need help.
The girls are scared.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.139

that there was a big

<i>She speaks to a neighbor

21:27.020 --> 21:30.154
<i>[Sandra] I started
talking to my neighbor.</i>

21:30.156 --> 21:33.924
She's the one that told me
that it was built in 1900,

21:33.926 --> 21:38.029
and the original owner
was an Italian man.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.463
<i>He built the house.</i>

21:40.866 --> 21:43.401
The houses only had two owners,

the man and wife
who built the house,

21:45.772 --> 21:49.040

who took it after they died.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.609
What do you remember about them?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.346
- Mmm. That they loved the house.
- Ah.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.281
<i>[Sandra] They loved their home.</i>

22:25.912 --> 22:30.181
that spirits do live
among us or walk among us,

But I didn't say a word
and I didn't move.

24:20.091 --> 24:23.160
<i>He shined this light
on my sister.</i>

24:23.162 --> 24:27.364
<i>And I realized he wasn't
holding a flashlight or a phone,</i>

<i>I remember just seeing the

24:56.194 --> 24:58.996
And I didn't move.

24:58.998 --> 25:03.934
And a couple seconds later,
I hear him walk out the house.

25:07.172 --> 25:11.175

<i>But Sabrina's memory of what

<i>keeps her from staying long.</i>

are you sure that you want to
sleep downstairs by yourself?

25:39.437 --> 25:41.205
I don't want to stay up here.

25:41.406 --> 25:42.473
It doesn't feel right.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.877
Like someone's
always watching me.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.813
I'd rather stay by the front
door in case something happens.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.282
I can just run out.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.183

behind the door,

26:44.370 --> 26:47.237
I was not really focused
on the feeling,

26:47.239 --> 26:50.541

felt heavy.

32:55.274 --> 32:59.009
<i>[Isidro] I started shouting
at them to leave us alone.</i>

32:59.011 --> 33:00.277
[in Spanish] Get out
of here, damned ghost!

33:00.279 --> 33:03.847
They heard me.
They didn't care.

33:03.849 --> 33:07.150
<i>[narrator] Desperate for help
and unsure of where to turn...</i>

33:08.753 --> 33:13.090
<i>for the Nuno family, a solution
appears from an unexpected source.</i>

33:14.926 --> 33:18.328
<i>It's Bill Bean,
a deliverance minister.</i>

33:18.330 --> 33:20.931
I felt that he was so powerful.

33:20.933 --> 33:24.835
I just was drawn to everything
that he was doing.

33:24.837 --> 33:29.072
And I watched the credits,
got his name,

33:29.074 --> 33:32.142
and then I contacted him.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.946
<i>[narrator] Bill agrees to come
to the house and help the family.</i>

33:40.585 --> 33:43.520
I was very desperate,
and it was my last chance.

33:45.923 --> 33:49.326
<i>[narrator] But the forces
of darkness seemed displeased</i>

33:49.328 --> 33:53.063
<i>about the minister's
impending arrival.</i>

33:53.065 --> 33:57.134
[Sabrina] I would wake up
and smell rotten egg.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.403
<i>It was just a really bad smell.</i>

34:01.339 --> 34:04.307
<i>I believed my life was at stake.</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:08.311
<i>[narrator] For some time,</i>

34:08.313 --> 34:13.283
<i>the Nuno family has been experiencing
escalating paranormal violence.</i>

34:13.285 --> 34:15.218
<i>They eagerly await the arrival</i>

34:15.220 --> 34:18.355
<i>of deliverance minister
Bill Bean.</i>

34:18.357 --> 34:20.690
<i>[Bill] I am a non-denomination</i>

34:20.692 --> 34:23.060
<i>spiritual deliverance minister.</i>

34:23.062 --> 34:29.032
It means that, by the power
of God working through me,

34:29.434 --> 34:32.135
I can deliver people from evil.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.270
Thank you so much for coming.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.940
I'm Isidro.
This is my wife, Sandra.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.644
Bill was at the house within
a week after I contacted him.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.613
I can feel already
that you are under attack.

34:43.615 --> 34:47.350
<i>[Bill] Sure enough, when
I arrived at the residence,</i>

34:47.352 --> 34:49.619
I felt the presence of evil
right away.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.221
It was a very heavy feeling.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.091
<i>I knew that
that family was in trouble.</i>

34:54.093 --> 34:58.328
<i>God shows me things like
that to put images in my head,</i>

34:58.330 --> 35:00.097
or just the knowing
of the situation,

35:00.099 --> 35:03.300
or even show me
some of these entities.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.635
<i>[Sabrina] At this point
of my life,</i>

35:05.637 --> 35:10.107
I was tired of having to live
in fear in my own home.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.876
I was tired of being attacked.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.611
I was just tired
with everything.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.946
I was tired with life.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.248
<i>Bill Bean was my last hope.</i>

35:18.250 --> 35:21.885
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.020
<i>[Bill] First thing I did
when I entered the home,</i>

35:24.022 --> 35:26.189
<i>I recited the Lord's Prayer.</i>

35:26.191 --> 35:28.625
It is all part of invoking
the power of God

35:28.627 --> 35:31.328
over the situation
and the victims.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.063
And lead us not to temptation,

35:33.065 --> 35:36.166
but deliver us
from the evil one,

35:36.168 --> 35:40.403
for thine is the Kingdom
and the power and the glory,

35:40.405 --> 35:43.006
forever and ever. Amen.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.441
[others] Amen.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.610
I am here to help.

35:47.345 --> 35:51.014
And I got to be honest,
I sense from God himself

35:51.016 --> 35:54.951
that you have several entities
and demons in your home.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.122
Do you know what a portal is?
Have you heard that word?

35:59.124 --> 36:00.157
No.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.826
A portal is like a door,

36:02.828 --> 36:08.231
and it's opened between the world
of the dead and this world on Earth.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.600
And when it's open...

36:11.903 --> 36:15.305
anything and everything
can come through.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.109
Do... do we have
portals in our house?

36:20.378 --> 36:23.513
Your house is filled
with open portals.

36:25.049 --> 36:29.152
But don't worry,
I'm going to close them.

36:29.954 --> 36:33.790
He said, "We have
to get rid of this evil

36:33.792 --> 36:38.195
that is literally sucking
the life out of your family."

36:38.197 --> 36:41.364
<i>I just had this gut feeling</i>

36:41.366 --> 36:45.435
<i>that he was the one that
was sent to us to help us,</i>

36:45.437 --> 36:47.370
<i>that he had the power to do it.</i>

36:47.372 --> 36:49.105
Let's begin.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.942
He blessed everything
with holy water.

36:51.944 --> 36:54.010
Every little thing.

36:54.012 --> 36:58.248
Father, I pray
that you bless this family.

36:59.083 --> 37:02.118
I pray that you send
50 of your strongest

37:02.120 --> 37:04.754
and most powerful warrior-angels

37:04.756 --> 37:08.425
to guard and protect them
and their home.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.996
<i>[Bill] As I'm going
through the Nuno home,</i>

37:12.998 --> 37:17.300
it is the power of God that works
through me to cast these demons out.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.102
By the mighty power of Yahweh,

37:19.104 --> 37:23.740
by his might and his Holy
name, and in the name of Jesus,

37:23.742 --> 37:27.577
I bind and rebuke every demon
that might be in this house.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.348
<i>[Bill] I saw demonic entities
in there,</i>

37:31.350 --> 37:33.216
<i>and mostly in the form
of black forms.</i>

37:33.218 --> 37:34.951
They're not scared of me.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.219
They would kill me
if they could.

37:36.221 --> 37:37.988
Let God arise.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.625
May his enemies be scattered.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.928
As the smoke is driven away,
so drive them away.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.998
As the wax melted
before the flame,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.033
so may the wicked perish

37:50.868 --> 37:53.203
at the presence
of the Almighty God.

37:53.205 --> 37:56.239
The power of God works
through me in such a strong way

37:56.241 --> 37:58.241
that demons
cannot withstand that.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.944
And they have to go.
They have to flee.

38:00.946 --> 38:07.350
Warrior-angels, bind and expel
all of the demons in this home!

38:07.352 --> 38:10.053
Take them into custody
and carry them off!

38:10.055 --> 38:13.723
Deposit them into the pits
of Hell, where they belong!

38:13.725 --> 38:16.459
All the lights started
to flicker and intensify.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.928
<i>Whatever he was doing
was working.</i>

38:18.930 --> 38:20.230
The light was so bright.

38:20.232 --> 38:23.300
I was in shock to see that.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.703
All of a sudden,
the lights were like

38:26.705 --> 38:28.371
they were going to explode.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.121
<i>[narrator] Deliverance
minister Bill Bean</i>

38:45.123 --> 38:49.059
<i>has fought a battle against
evil in the Nuno family's home...</i>

38:52.430 --> 38:55.098
<i>dispelling the darkness.</i>

38:57.001 --> 39:01.371
I felt a huge weight
lifted off my shoulders.

39:01.373 --> 39:05.008
Everything felt...
It felt good.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.111
<i>[Isidro] The whole house
felt very at peace.</i>

39:08.113 --> 39:10.046
<i>You feel at ease.</i>

39:10.281 --> 39:13.316
You feel, uh, serenity.

39:14.819 --> 39:18.888
[Bill] God, I ask
that your warrior-angels

39:18.890 --> 39:23.526
take back any spirit left in this
house that belongs with you.

39:25.129 --> 39:28.698
<i>[narrator] Bill confirms that
in addition to the dark entity,</i>

39:28.700 --> 39:33.570
<i>the spirits of the original
owners still reside in the home.</i>

39:36.474 --> 39:40.377
Take them home, Father,
to your heavenly Kingdom,

39:41.412 --> 39:42.879
in Jesus' name.

39:42.913 --> 39:44.748
Amen.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.250
<i>[Sandra] I didn't want
the original owners to stay,</i>

39:47.252 --> 39:50.253
<i>because I believe that it was
time for them to rest.</i>

39:50.255 --> 39:54.357
It was better for them to
leave, and Bill sent them away.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.327
I believe they were here
because they loved their home...

39:58.929 --> 40:02.132
and because they were
trying to protect Sabrina

40:02.134 --> 40:04.200
from the darker things
in the house.

40:05.870 --> 40:11.307
It was told to me that Isidro,
his ancestors, have gifts.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.144
So this carries on
through the family lineage,

40:14.146 --> 40:15.712
<i>to Sabrina.</i>

40:15.714 --> 40:21.084
Bill Bean told me
that I have extra sensitivity

40:21.086 --> 40:27.290
because of my twin
not making it in the womb.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.795
<i>He did warn me that,
because I am a sensitive,</i>

40:31.797 --> 40:36.366
that they would be
attracted more so to me.

40:40.438 --> 40:44.474
He did explain that
my sister would be able to...

40:45.109 --> 40:47.477
like, defend herself from them.

40:48.846 --> 40:51.448
<i>[Bill] Having those
types of gifts,</i>

40:51.450 --> 40:54.784
and if they can make
the transformation

40:54.786 --> 40:58.021
from victim to victor,
there's no limit

40:58.023 --> 41:02.258
to what God will do through
them in helping others.

41:06.630 --> 41:07.864
It's your house.

41:08.065 --> 41:09.199
[Sandra] <i>We were standing
outside, and I looked at it,</i>

41:09.201 --> 41:12.001
and it just looked
like there was a glow.

41:12.436 --> 41:14.270
A glow around the whole house.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.641
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:18.643 --> 41:24.280
I truly appreciate Bill Bean,
and I fully believe what he does.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.915
[narrator]
<i>Since Bill's blessing,</i>

41:25.917 --> 41:29.252
<i>the Nuno family
feels more at peace.</i>

41:29.254 --> 41:32.589
The house feels so light,
so loving.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.258
And it's great.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.864
<i>[Sabrina] I feel like after
everything that has happened,</i>

41:40.866 --> 41:43.099
<i>my family and I
are a lot stronger</i>

41:43.101 --> 41:45.635
<i>and a lot closer
with each other.</i>

41:45.637 --> 41:48.104
<i>I feel like it brought us
closer together.</i>

41:51.876 --> 41:54.010
[calm music playing]

42:00.284 --> 42:02.252
[suspenseful music playing]

42:05.055 --> 42:06.923
[eerie music playing]
