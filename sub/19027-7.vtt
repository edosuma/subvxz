You're not aware
of any sort of odd,

01:18.917 --> 01:21.917
underground canal system
beneath the hospital, are you?

01:22.375 --> 01:24.208
I think I saw a manatee.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.625
Was his name Julian?

01:25.709 --> 01:27.542
We didn't exchange
pleasantries.

01:27.625 --> 01:28.917
That's Julian.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.500
Watch it. Wet paint.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.417
Kelso's starting a new line system
to help people get around.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.083
Green's gonna go

blue to the I.C.U.,
yellow to all the exits.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.834
-What's red for?
-Sneaker painting.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.834
Ok, I'm here.
What's the emergency, Keith?

01:48.917 --> 01:51.333
Do you want Mr. Fleming
on unfractionated

01:51.417 --> 01:53.500
or low molecular weight heparin?

01:53.583 --> 01:56.583
They're the exact same thing.
Every doctor here knows that.

01:56.667 --> 01:57.750
Why would you page me?

01:57.834 --> 02:01.333
Because I told him to, and I know
what you're thinking, Dorothy.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.750
Why would I have
your intern call you in

02:03.834 --> 02:05.834
on one of your
very precious days off

02:05.917 --> 02:07.709
for something so gosh darn trivial?

02:07.792 --> 02:11.208
The real question ought to be:
Why, when youwere an intern,

02:11.291 --> 02:13.917
did you call me in time after time
after time after time?

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So now, to commemorate the first
of many unnecessary disruptions

02:18.083 --> 02:21.750

Dorian, I need you to do the
residents' call schedules

03:16.083 --> 03:17.875
-for next month.
-Sir, I'm not even supposed

03:17.959 --> 03:20.291
-to be here.
-Ah, me neither, son.

03:20.375 --> 03:23.291
I was one of the most promising,
young short-stops

03:23.375 --> 03:25.458
ever to come out of
Altoona, Pennsylvania.

03:25.542 --> 03:26.917
Then came the Dominicans.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.333
Long story short, calling them all
"pepe"

03:29.417 --> 03:32.333
was apparently just racist enough
to get me a life-long ban

03:32.417 --> 03:34.166
from the Appalachian rookie league.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.166
Have the schedules
on my desk by lunch.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
(Carla) Aww.

03:40.083 --> 03:42.125
That's gonna be us someday.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.125
How does that
not make you nervous?

03:44.709 --> 03:46.291
I mean, what if our kid's
out of control?

03:46.375 --> 03:48.125
Like I was watching
<i>Webster</i> last night, right,

03:48.208 --> 03:49.875
and Webster got all
into the pancake mix,

03:49.959 --> 03:52.375
and, baby, I mean
all into the pancake mix.

03:52.458 --> 03:54.667
Oh, Turk, that's a stupid sitcom.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.000
(both gasp)

03:56.083 --> 03:58.500
I mean that's a sitcom.

03:58.583 --> 04:01.792
What if the second our baby's born,
I start screwing things up?

04:03.458 --> 04:05.583
Oh, my God. Hey, little...

04:05.667 --> 04:08.500
Ohh, I can't believe it.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.375
(babies crying)

04:17.667 --> 04:20.291
Ok, either the heat
in my office is broken

04:20.375 --> 04:23.375
or I drifted off and fantasized
about Rudy Giuliani again.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.792
Ha ha! He's not even sexy.
Right, baby?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.875
Ay, Rudy, don't stop.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.208
-Baby!
-Huh?

04:30.291 --> 04:34.542
Relax. She's only fantasizing
'cause you don't satisfy her.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.417
Anyhoo, can someone
take Jack for a minute?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.500
No problem.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.333
Thank you.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.333
See, Turk? I'm great with kids,

04:43.417 --> 04:45.583
and I promise you don't even have to
check in as a parent

04:45.667 --> 04:47.250
until you have to teach
our son about sports.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.917
And satisfying women.

04:49.333 --> 04:51.542
'Cause I know how to satisfy
a woman, right, baby?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.750
I'm sure you can.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.792
That's what I'm talkin' about.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.959
Done... And I am out of here.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.208
(beeping)

05:01.291 --> 05:02.667
Dammit!

05:03.542 --> 05:06.625
Hey, you've got to stop paging me
for totally unimportant things.

05:06.709 --> 05:07.709
Ohh!

05:08.500 --> 05:11.208
That man's chest cavity
is completely open.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.041
I can see his heart beating.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.041
He sneezed and all his surgical
staples popped out.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.625
Good page, Keith, good page.

05:17.709 --> 05:20.959
Ok, rockers-- that's my name
for doctors who rock--

05:21.041 --> 05:22.542
next patient. Hmm.

05:22.625 --> 05:23.625
(J.D.)<i> Ever since her fellowship,</i>

05:23.709 --> 05:26.875
<i>Elliot loved that her interns saw</i>
<i>her as an endocrinology expert.</i>

05:27.208 --> 05:30.208
Dr. Reid, why would Mr. Baum develop
new onset diabetes

05:30.291 --> 05:32.208
and high blood pressure
simultaneously?

05:32.291 --> 05:35.959
Well, as an endocrinology expert,
in my expert opinion,

05:36.041 --> 05:38.792
both can be expertly explained
by a pituitary adenoma

05:38.875 --> 05:40.250
causing cushing syndrome.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.083
Hate to burst your bubble there,
Barbie,

05:42.166 --> 05:45.875
but your endocrinology fellowship
lasted all of 5 days.

05:45.959 --> 05:49.250
Granted to you, 5 days
may seem like an eternity,

05:49.333 --> 05:51.500
seeing as it's roughly 5 times

05:51.583 --> 05:54.333
as long as any of your white, pasty
relationships have lasted,

05:54.417 --> 05:57.291
but trust me, that hardly
makes you an expert.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.041
Oh, really? Because you never went
to ass face school,

06:00.125 --> 06:02.875
but you seem to be
an expert at that. Am I right?

06:02.959 --> 06:04.500
-Here's some.
-Ha ha.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.166
You're going to high-five that?

06:06.250 --> 06:08.792
Bi-ig mistake.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.625
I didn't know what I was
high-fiving.

06:10.709 --> 06:12.041
I gotta stop doing that.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.750
Did you eat
my mango body butter?

06:14.834 --> 06:17.041
-No.
-(J.D.)<i> I shmeared it on a bagel.</i>

06:19.083 --> 06:20.083
Dr. Kelso!

06:20.458 --> 06:21.458
'Sup.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.500
Look, I just heard that we're doing

06:23.583 --> 06:25.500
our first ever in-house heart
transplant.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.083
Now I know you'll be objective

06:27.166 --> 06:29.500
in choosing which
surgical resident gets to assist,

06:29.583 --> 06:31.834
but I also thought you might enjoy

06:31.917 --> 06:34.875
this commemorative
Dr. Kelso bobble head. Huh?

06:34.959 --> 06:37.667
Oh, bobble heads.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.667
You always think you're gonna get
bored with it, but you never do.

06:41.291 --> 06:43.291
Bobbly bobbly
bobbly bobbly bobbly

06:43.375 --> 06:45.583
bobbly bobbly
bobbly bobbly bobbly--

06:45.667 --> 06:46.750
sir?

06:46.834 --> 06:49.625
Huh? Oh! Turkleton,
you're still here.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.500
Did you honestly think
you'd be the only surgeon

06:52.583 --> 06:54.291
to walk in here
and try to bribe me?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.792
Inflatable five.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.333
None of you
will be assisting on anything

07:04.417 --> 07:06.834
because we still
don't have a donor heart.

07:07.417 --> 07:10.709
Last night, Mr. Bulger here
was declared brain dead.

07:10.792 --> 07:14.375
We have to convince his family to
pull the plug and give us his heart.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.458
Whichever one of you
benihana rejects pulls this off

07:17.542 --> 07:18.750
gets the operation.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.583
Go!

07:24.041 --> 07:26.709
My band has decided
we're only singing songs

07:26.792 --> 07:28.333

07:28.417 --> 07:31.250
Ted, I'm a little busy, ok? Toodles.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.083
Dr. Reid, what are the possible
cardiac complications

07:35.166 --> 07:36.834
to thyrotoxicosis?

07:37.500 --> 07:38.667
(coughs) Hmm.

-Wrong-o, Perry.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.083

is most likely due to

08:42.166 --> 08:44.083
type I familial
hyperlipoproteinemia,

08:44.166 --> 08:47.667
as demonstrated by the eruptive

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

off the top of that straw-colored
scarecrow head of yours.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.834

a quick mental picture

08:59.917 --> 09:01.417
of your total humiliation.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.917
(click click)
Got it.

09:03.041 --> 09:08.542
There are, actually, many things in
life that I've yet to figure out,

09:08.625 --> 09:11.291
like why men wear
cell phones on their belt

09:11.375 --> 09:13.792
when they could so easily
fit them in their pocket

09:13.875 --> 09:15.542
mere millimeters away

09:15.625 --> 09:18.125
or why, and I'm not complaining...

09:18.667 --> 09:21.250
women wear tube tops,
even though every 10 seconds

09:21.333 --> 09:23.000
it makes them do this.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.917
"You gotta get back
in there now!"

09:26.000 --> 09:28.333
But of all my endless queries,

09:28.417 --> 09:31.083
the one thing I damn sure will
figure out and soon

09:31.166 --> 09:34.375
is how you keep coming up
with all these fancy pants answers.

09:34.458 --> 09:38.709
It is, for all intents and purposes,
like they're falling from the sky.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.750
-(crying)
-Excuse me.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.667
Can anybody else
watch this kid for a second?

09:46.709 --> 09:47.709
Ohh.

09:51.667 --> 09:52.667
She'll be all right.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.875
I wonder what's
taking Jordan so long.

09:54.959 --> 10:00.083
Oh, my God! It's like
130 degrees in here!

10:01.166 --> 10:02.166
Ohh!

10:02.792 --> 10:05.000
I have got to get out of here!

10:07.291 --> 10:08.291
(sighs)

10:09.000 --> 10:15.417
Hmm, I think the silicone
in my lips is expanding.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.834
(groans)

10:17.917 --> 10:19.583
Anyway, I gotta talk to the Bulger
family

10:19.667 --> 10:21.834
about getting their son's heart,
but I can't find them anywhere.

10:21.917 --> 10:23.959
Oh, they're in the doctors lounge.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.625
Oh, my God, Laverne, I love you.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.834
Listen, if any other surgeon
asks about them,

10:27.917 --> 10:29.125
you send them someplace else--

10:29.208 --> 10:31.625
the cafeteria, the zoo,
I don't care.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.291
I'm going to get my heart.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.000
We're just not sure, Dr. Turk.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.542
(J.D.)<i> When a career-making</i>
<i>opportunity</i>

10:41.625 --> 10:44.291
<i>is slipping through their fingers,</i>
<i>even a doctor can succumb</i>

10:44.375 --> 10:46.500
<i>to one of the basest</i>
<i>human impulses...</i>

10:46.959 --> 10:48.834
You know, I've donated an organ.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.250
<i>...they can lie.</i>

10:50.750 --> 10:53.000
See, my buddy, he was sick,

10:53.083 --> 10:55.041
and so I gave him
one of my kidneys.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.917
But my son has only one heart.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.208
But, uh, a short time after that,
I donated my other kidney.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.959
We're gonna check on our son.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.834
(J.D.)
<i>Ok, the coast is clear.</i>

11:11.917 --> 11:13.750
<i>Just a few more steps</i>
<i>and you're out of here.</i>

11:13.834 --> 11:15.291
-(Jack crying)
-J.D.!

11:15.375 --> 11:17.166
I need to talk to someone.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.542
-Here, take him.
-What?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.959
-Yup.
-No, come on.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.542
Hey, wait, no!

11:23.625 --> 11:26.250
Dr. Reid, our hospital lecture
series is tonight

11:26.333 --> 11:29.000
and our psychologist,
Dr. Burke, had to cancel his talk

11:29.083 --> 11:30.625
on fear of public speaking.

11:30.709 --> 11:33.625
Why? Because he's afraid
of speaking in public?

11:33.709 --> 11:34.709
(chuckles)

11:34.792 --> 11:39.041
No. His depression finally got the
best of him and he hung himself.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.709
Anyhoo, we need a speaker

11:42.792 --> 11:45.291
and Dr. Cox suggested
you'd be the perfect person

11:45.375 --> 11:47.792
for an intensive Q &amp; A
on endocrinology.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.500
Be in the classroom at 6:00.

11:50.125 --> 11:53.041
(Dr. Cox) And, Barbie,
say, if it's cold in there,

11:53.125 --> 11:54.709
you can just borrow my lab coat.

11:54.792 --> 11:58.208
It's super warm
because I lined it with these.

11:58.709 --> 12:00.333
Ta-da!

12:01.250 --> 12:02.625
Um...

12:03.542 --> 12:05.458
J.D., I have to admit
this to somebody.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.166
I don't like kids!

12:07.250 --> 12:09.333
What are you talking about? You're
the most maternal person I know.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.458
I'm a nurse, J.D.
I'm trained to fake it.

12:11.542 --> 12:12.875
I just don't see
what's so adorable.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.792
I mean, "yay, you made
a poopie in the potty."

12:14.875 --> 12:15.959
I'm supposed to be impressed?

12:16.041 --> 12:17.542
There's a monkey
at the zoo who can do that.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.375
I mean, you know, when he's not
playing with himself.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.542
Well, if you don't want to have a
baby, Carla, don't have a baby.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.291
But, J.D., I want to
have a child with Turk

12:24.375 --> 12:25.792
more than anything in the world.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.291
I know, it's crazy, but I'm a girl.
That's how we roll.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.750
-(elevator dings)
-What am I gonna do?

12:29.834 --> 12:31.709
I'm supposed to be the brave one.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.750
Dude, you got to help me out.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.959
(J.D.)<i> A hospital can sometimes feel</i>
<i>like a magical place...</i>

12:37.625 --> 12:40.750
<i>where people's hopes and dreams</i>
<i>are often far from ordinary.</i>

12:42.125 --> 12:43.750
<i>Whether they're looking for</i>
<i>brains...</i>

12:44.208 --> 12:45.417
<i>a heart...</i>

12:46.375 --> 12:47.417
<i>or courage.</i>

12:47.500 --> 12:50.500
(singing
"We're Off To See The Wizard")

12:50.583 --> 12:53.792
<i>As for me, I was just gonna keep on</i>
<i>following that yellow line...</i>

12:54.625 --> 12:57.125
<i>and hope I'd eventually</i>
<i>get back home.</i>

13:09.208 --> 13:11.083
-So how was the zoo?
-It was awesome.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.458
They had lions
and tigers and bears--

13:13.542 --> 13:15.375
Oh, my. Hey, there.

13:15.458 --> 13:16.875
Dude, it was awful.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.542
I couldn't stop lying to them.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.000
I only have 2 moves.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.458
If surgery goes well--

13:21.792 --> 13:24.291
the fake modest nod and wink.
(clicks tongue)

13:24.792 --> 13:27.125
Now if surgery goes bad
and the guy dies,

13:27.208 --> 13:29.875
there's always the head shake,
sad walk-away.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.166
Turk, Toto and I are going home.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.250
Fine!

13:33.917 --> 13:36.500
(sad music plays)

13:37.750 --> 13:40.625
-(record needle scratch)
-Ok, I'll help.

13:40.709 --> 13:42.458
Thank you.
Now how do I tell these people

13:42.542 --> 13:43.750
they should let their son go?

13:43.834 --> 13:46.083
Just try and imagine
what they're going through.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.875
I mean, sometimes I think about what
it's gonna be like when you die.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.291
Because you think I'm going first
due to my diabetes.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.208
Right. And where do we
meet up in heaven?

13:53.291 --> 13:56.041
At the milkshake pool
on the lesbian cloud.

13:56.125 --> 13:59.291
I'll see you there, player!
I love religion.

13:59.375 --> 14:02.041
The point is, Turk, if someone tried
to pull the plug on you

14:02.125 --> 14:03.458
without being
totally honest with me,

14:03.542 --> 14:05.834
-you know where they'd end up?
-In hell watching theview<i>.</i>

14:05.917 --> 14:08.667
Next to the super high unreachable
cupcake table.

14:11.375 --> 14:13.291
(J.D.)<i> After trying to get out of</i>
<i>the hospital vertically,</i>

14:13.375 --> 14:15.291
<i>I decided to go</i>
<i>the horizontal route--</i>

14:15.375 --> 14:16.875
hiding in a body bag.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.667
-Can you press lobby, please?
-Aaaahhh!

14:21.750 --> 14:24.083
Oww! Oww! Oww!

14:24.166 --> 14:26.417
Doug, why are you
hitting me?!

14:26.500 --> 14:28.792
'Cause I thought you
were a dead guy coming back to life!

14:29.583 --> 14:33.375
-Then why were you hitting me?!
-Dead people should be dead.

14:33.458 --> 14:36.000
-There you are. Come on.
-No, no. Elliot,

14:36.083 --> 14:37.583
I'm not even supposed to be here
today. I'm going home.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.792
So if I understand correctly,
you left my only child

14:42.875 --> 14:45.542
with a creepy borderline psychotic
who hates everyone.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.458
How is that different from leaving
him with you?

14:47.542 --> 14:48.542
I have freckles.

14:48.625 --> 14:51.625
(muffled) Oil can. Oil can!

14:53.083 --> 14:56.000
-Thank you.
-Hey, yo, where's my son?

14:56.083 --> 14:58.458
Oh, he's playing with the birds
out on the ledge.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.500
-(gasps) What?
-I'm kidding.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.041
Come on, he's green.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.542
(laughing)

15:05.625 --> 15:07.208
Hmm.

15:08.709 --> 15:09.709
Come on.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.792
Yeah, the little nipper
got ahold of a paint gun

15:11.875 --> 15:13.041
when I was painting
this green line

15:13.125 --> 15:14.208
down to the smokers lounge.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.500
Thanks to him,
I only got halfway down.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.125
You look familiar.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.542
You ever play ball in Pennsylvania?

15:25.709 --> 15:27.000
Pepe?

15:39.959 --> 15:43.000
Mr. Bulger. Look, before
you throw me out of here...

15:44.125 --> 15:46.375
I just want to apologize
about earlier.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.125
I don't know what I was thinking.

15:49.542 --> 15:53.291
But rest assured, from here on out,
whatever you ask me...

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
I'll be completely honest with you.

15:56.709 --> 15:57.959
Do you shave your head

15:58.041 --> 16:00.834
because you like the way it looks
or because you're going bald?

16:01.709 --> 16:02.709
Bald.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.041
Ok, next question.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.208
With all those topical treatments,

16:06.291 --> 16:08.709
let's just say I wasn't completely
functional.

16:09.417 --> 16:12.333
Why are all the surgical residents

16:12.417 --> 16:15.375
being so relentless
about my son's heart?

16:16.083 --> 16:19.166
Because whichever one of us
convinces you to pull the plug

16:19.250 --> 16:23.000
and donate his heart
gets to assist in the transplant.

16:24.667 --> 16:29.041
You're talking about my son here...
and you don't even know him.

16:30.667 --> 16:31.667
What's his name?

16:33.959 --> 16:34.959
Ray.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.125
How you doing, Ray?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.917
Now ask me if I think
it's the right thing to do,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.583
even if you request
that I don't assist.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.834
Do you?

16:52.709 --> 16:53.875
Yes.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.875
I'm really sorry.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.500
J.D., there is no way that I'm gonna
be able to pull this off.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.917
In a few hours, I'm going to have
a room full of specialists

17:13.000 --> 17:14.417
firing questions at me.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.542
I'm gonna be a bigger fraud
than Barry Bonds.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.625
(J.D.)<i> Ok, you know he's</i>
<i>an athlete of some kind.</i>

17:18.709 --> 17:19.959
<i>Just say something general.</i>

17:20.291 --> 17:23.625
Still, I love it when Bonds wins
at the game that he plays.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.500
Look, Elliot, you know how people
become specialists?

17:26.917 --> 17:30.000
They obsess about the material
over and over again

17:30.083 --> 17:31.834
until it becomes lodged
into their brains,

17:31.917 --> 17:33.583
and that's exactly
what you've been doing.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.458
Watch. Where's the closest page
you've hidden around here?

17:37.375 --> 17:39.500
Huh? You are good.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.417
All right, look,

17:41.500 --> 17:44.834
"what's the leading differential
in an obese woman suffering

17:44.917 --> 17:46.959
from amenorrhea and hirsutism?"

17:47.041 --> 17:48.583
Polycystic ovaries.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.792
Oh, my God, I knew it!
Ha! Up here.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.041
Ha ha!

17:54.834 --> 17:55.917
Dr. Cox?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.750
Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.875
Why aren't you freaking out?

18:04.583 --> 18:07.000
Look at him. Your kid's,
like, all green and slimy.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.500
I suppose it's because
when Jordan was pregnant,

18:09.583 --> 18:11.333
I mentally prepared myself

18:11.417 --> 18:14.709
for her giving birth to something
green and slimy.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.500
Where is Jordan, anyway?

18:16.583 --> 18:18.959
The wicked witch of the east wing?

18:19.041 --> 18:22.500
Help! I'm melting in here!

18:23.125 --> 18:26.875
Anyone! Help! I'm melting!

18:26.959 --> 18:30.000
So he's green, don't beat yourself
up, Carla.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.750
Come on, so far on my watch,

18:31.834 --> 18:33.750
he's gotten stitches,
cut his own hair,

18:33.834 --> 18:35.875
and eaten over $4.00 in change.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.500
Honestly,

18:37.583 --> 18:39.583
if I ever need to feed
the parking meter,

18:39.667 --> 18:42.041
I just check the diaper, don't I?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.125
You don't understand.

18:44.709 --> 18:47.250
I didn't dump him on the janitor
because I was busy.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.834
I dumped him on him because
he was working my last nerve

18:49.917 --> 18:51.834
and I wanted to smoosh his face.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.667
I'm not meant for this.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.417
Carla, look at me and Jordan.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.375
-You know how we hate everyone?
-Yeah?

19:00.458 --> 19:02.625
Well, and that goes
doubley for children.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.875
It's true. They're loud,
you can't understand them,

19:04.959 --> 19:07.291
they're like tiny cab drivers.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.542
(laughs)

19:09.291 --> 19:10.959
But, trust me...

19:11.792 --> 19:15.542
when you do have your own kid,
you won't feel that way.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.709
Yeah? Well, what will be different?

19:18.792 --> 19:20.041
(laughs)

19:20.625 --> 19:21.750
He'll be yours.

19:25.917 --> 19:28.875
(TV playing indistinctly)

19:28.959 --> 19:30.000
(turns off TV)

19:30.083 --> 19:31.750
Sir, I was watching that.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.834
Well, why don't I just
tell you what happened.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.583
Uncle Phillip
gets Webster the dog

19:35.667 --> 19:37.500
despite George
and ma'am's objections.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.166
It was good.
Now, on your feet.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.875
They need you in the O.R.
to assist on the heart transplant.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.166
The Bulgers said yes?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.750
Mr. Bulger wanted you to have this.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.333
His son's driver's license?

19:51.417 --> 19:52.500
Turn it over.

19:52.583 --> 19:55.000
(J.D.)<i> Every so often,</i>
<i>a wizard comes along</i>

19:55.083 --> 19:57.291
<i>and tells you exactly</i>

19:57.375 --> 19:59.709
Seems like you had
a heart all along.

20:03.667 --> 20:04.750
Superior vena cava?

20:04.834 --> 20:06.625
That's right.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.792
See? You had the brains all along.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.875
Trust me, Carla.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.875
When you do have
your own kid...

20:16.542 --> 20:19.208
you're gonna find you had the
courage to be a parent all along.
