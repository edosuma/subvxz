WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:08.530
Previously on
Star Picard...

00:08.573 --> 00:09.879
The tunnels...

00:09.922 --> 00:12.360
-You said, "Don't go."
-Maman!

00:12.403 --> 00:15.319
Thousand ways to die down there.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.974
-It was hours
before I found you.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.584
Your mother suffered.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.456
She needed help,
but she wouldn't accept it.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.893
You have to get me out.
Please, Jean-Luc.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.547
All of that was
part of Q's plan?

00:25.590 --> 00:27.592
That you experience
those memories?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.767
You know there's more
to that story.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.901
Whatever it is, it is irrelevant

00:31.944 --> 00:33.511
with what we are trying to fix.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.339
We fix time...

00:35.383 --> 00:37.776
-does it bring Elnor back?
-I don't know.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.387
-If you want to talk...
-You know, what I want

00:39.430 --> 00:41.693
is to try to figure out
how to fix the time line

00:41.737 --> 00:44.740
and not talk about how it felt
to watch him die.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.829
I want to show you something.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.050
Welcome to La Sirena.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.576
I would like to have more
in my memory bank

00:54.619 --> 00:56.578
than all the times
I saved your ass.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.667
Before you fly away.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.278
What's wrong?

01:01.322 --> 01:03.628
Error-- transporter off-line.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.456
Rios to Raffi.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.371
We got big problems.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.117
No...

01:14.161 --> 01:15.597
No!

01:17.512 --> 01:20.036
You're currently at a fork
in the proverbial road.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.255
Two futures.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.734
One leads to you
bringing humanity

01:22.778 --> 01:24.519
back from the edge
of extinction.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.477
Or you die alone.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.653
Renée Picard either boards
a spaceship and makes

01:28.697 --> 01:30.655
a discovery that renders
your work obsolete

01:30.699 --> 01:32.744
or doesn't.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.355
There's a man
who will stand in your way

01:34.398 --> 01:36.574
as he now stands in mine.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.446
-- Picard?
-- I can get you
face-to-face with him

01:38.489 --> 01:39.838
in a matter of minutes.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.492
I can also provide you with

01:41.536 --> 01:43.842
appropriate means
to dispose of him.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.496
-We know where she's heading.
-There's only one reason

01:45.540 --> 01:47.324
Jurati would want to take over
the transporter.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.326
The Queen is coming
for La Sirena.

01:49.370 --> 01:52.677
She wants a 400-year jump start
on assimilating the galaxy.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.462
Once I have the ship,

01:54.505 --> 01:56.638
you can have your legacy.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.857
We have to defend that ship

01:58.901 --> 02:01.686
if we are to make our way home.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.559
So if she's coming for the ship,
she's not coming alone.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.431
Don't worry.
It only stings for a moment.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.417
They're activating
the transport remotely.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.854
I can't stop it.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.945
They're here.

02:42.988 --> 02:45.121
-Who's here?
-We have to get off this ship.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.167
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.995
I'm sorry I ever brought you
into this.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.607
I need to get you to safety.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.652
Weapons.

02:56.915 --> 02:59.353
-Wait, wait, wait!
Move, move, move, move!

03:16.805 --> 03:18.589
Well...

03:18.633 --> 03:20.504
we've looked better.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.910
Starting to feel
more like myself.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.273
If the Queen means
to take over the ship,

03:50.317 --> 03:51.883
we have to defend it,

03:51.927 --> 03:53.537
-no matter the cost.
-Defend it with what?

03:53.581 --> 03:56.236
-Oh.
-Oh.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.716
-That's all you brought?
-Lucky we even had time
to get these.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.805
All right, we recon.
Fortify our position.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.807
We set traps with
whatever's available.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.810
-Okay, but how much time
do we even have?
-None.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.725
-Go hide back there.
-Come on.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.684
-Is she coming?
-She's already on the ship.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.252
And there's more. Lots more.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.517
-Take cover!
-Go, go!

06:32.217 --> 06:35.525
She means to pin us down
while she takes the ship.

06:47.537 --> 06:50.932
I won't let you take this ship.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.934
There you are.

06:52.977 --> 06:55.284
I could still sense you
in there.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.155
Still feel you chattering about.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.244
Do you know what it feels like
to put my hands

06:59.288 --> 07:01.072
on my friend's throat
and not be able to do

07:01.116 --> 07:02.465
a goddamn thing about it?

07:02.509 --> 07:05.468
A bit like hanging limbless,
powerless.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.471
I've been poking around
in that trash dump of a mind.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.473
Wow, by the way.

07:10.517 --> 07:13.258
'Cause I had to know why.

07:13.302 --> 07:16.697
Millions of species, planets,

07:16.740 --> 07:19.351
and still you always
needed more.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.745
Perfection takes time, dear.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.660
This was never about perfection
or evolution

07:23.704 --> 07:25.401
or any of that bullshit.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.012
It was never enough,
because you're just like me.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.450
Lonely.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.105
To share your own crude
colloquialism, bullshit.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.498
Then why haven't you killed me?

07:35.542 --> 07:38.109
Stop. Stop.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.851
You take this ship,
you let Soong win,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.374
in 400 years, the Confederation

07:42.418 --> 07:43.941
wipes out your entire
collective.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.030
So myopically linear.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.424
You see the branch
but not the tree.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.427
We know of the Confederation's
threat now,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.821
and we will prepare.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.823
Time...

07:55.866 --> 07:57.999
is on our side.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.180
Error-- key code required
for access.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.661
Whoops. You know that, uh,
signal you use

08:07.704 --> 08:09.706
to puppet around your Borg?

08:09.750 --> 08:11.534
Well, I used it to slap
a fractal lock

08:11.578 --> 08:13.144
on the ship's systems.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.103
Welcome to the world's
biggest paperweight.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.409
I'll scrape that key
out of our mind, woman.

08:17.453 --> 08:20.587
Except I'm not an idiot
and I didn't memorize the code.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.766
I couldn't stop you,
but I could stall you.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.029
Turns out this ship
can make a hologram

08:28.072 --> 08:30.118
from anyone who's ever
been on board,

08:30.161 --> 08:33.208
including
an Emergency Combat Hologram.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.299
How may I be of service?

08:38.605 --> 08:42.652
I encoded the digital key in the
safest place I could find: him.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.959
Hiya, Elnor.
Let's play keep-away.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.091
With pleasure.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.244
She brought an army.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.551
No, she made one.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.770
Those aren't people out there.
They're Borg.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.301
Cover your eyes!

09:25.695 --> 09:27.305
Mother?

09:27.349 --> 09:28.698
Yes?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.178
Can we play a game?

09:31.179 --> 09:34.399
What sort of game?

09:34.443 --> 09:36.576
Play anything you want.
Just don't break anything.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.055
Maurice, must you be
such a curmudgeon?

09:38.099 --> 09:40.667
It's a lovely day.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.712
Wars have been fought
on lovely days.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.758
Industry and discovery
don't reserve themselves

09:44.801 --> 09:48.065
for a slight chance of rain,
so I've been told.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.415
-Curmudgeon.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.635
This is your work, is it? This
is what you're teaching him.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.115
-How to make fun of his dad.
-It's common knowledge.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.204
-Is it?
-Mm.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.559
He's a smart young man.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.388
Terribly bored.
Far too much time on his hands.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.438
And how are you these days,
my darling?

10:13.482 --> 10:15.615
I notice, uh, lately that...

10:16.746 --> 10:18.879
...you've been somewhat
more present.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.533
Maurice.

10:21.577 --> 10:25.146
You haven't had an incident
for some time now.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.669
That's good.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.584
That's very good.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.196
Maybe times are changing
for the better.

10:39.813 --> 10:43.251
Maman?What game shall we play?

10:48.386 --> 10:51.433
How about hide-and-seek?

10:52.695 --> 10:55.916
You stand here, like so.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.920
Cover your eyes.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.792
And count to five,
and come find me.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.928
One, two...

11:11.148 --> 11:12.193
Come on.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.022
I count nine.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.719
-Eight now.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.112
But there's more coming.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.548
Go inside.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.290
On three. One, two...

11:22.333 --> 11:25.032
three!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

11:34.868 --> 11:38.262
Tallinn, beam Rios, Teresa
and the boy to safety.

11:38.306 --> 11:41.004
-What about us?
-We've got to save the ship.

11:41.048 --> 11:44.007
A Borg with advanced technology
in this century--

11:44.051 --> 11:46.749
can you imagine the damage
she would inflict?

11:46.793 --> 11:49.752
I'll get them to safety,
but I'm coming right back.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.450
Tallinn, please! Now!

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
Now, turn it off.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.897
Go, go, go.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.855
Lay him down.
Put a blanket on him.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.075
He's in shock. I'll be back.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.903
You can't go back.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.469
I can't not.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.650
No, no, no, no, no.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.565
Damn you, Picard.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.789
They've locked me out.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.185
I can't help them.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.057
He's wounded.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.973
He'd only get himself killed
trying to help us.

12:37.017 --> 12:39.628
We can't push forward.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.631
We go around.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.981
Tallinn, lay down
suppressing fire.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.678
We retreat through the château,
then split up.

12:46.722 --> 12:47.941
Split up?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.769
We have twice as many chances

12:49.812 --> 12:51.771
to get to the ship
if we divide and conquer.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.469
We flank 'em in the field
and then take the damn ship.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.470
Do it.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.316
Picard!

13:17.405 --> 13:19.407
Wait.

13:19.450 --> 13:23.498
Fire, and you'll receive
far worse in kind.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.895
Or you can hear my offer.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.986
I'm not...

13:33.029 --> 13:35.684
Well, I wasn't
a violent man, Picard.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.860
This is all very new to me.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.907
Or the promise of legacy

13:40.950 --> 13:44.867
revealed the rot that is hidden
underneath it.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.174
I know a future
worth fighting for.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.828
So do I.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.742
Look, you're outnumbered.

13:50.786 --> 13:54.529
And my new friends back there...

13:54.572 --> 13:58.925
well, I've heard you're
familiar with them.

13:58.968 --> 14:03.581
So I guess you help her
take the ship,

14:03.625 --> 14:06.889
and she destroys
the Europa Mission

14:06.933 --> 14:11.328
from orbit tomorrow, and you...

14:11.372 --> 14:13.330
have a future.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.899
So, why this parlay?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.947
The enemy of every experiment

14:20.990 --> 14:24.472
is the rogue variable,
the unknown.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.083
That is what you are to me.

14:27.127 --> 14:29.520
So do us both a favor.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.348
Stand down.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.176
Surrender.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.788
I take the path of
least resistance to the future,

14:36.832 --> 14:40.749
and you and your friends
can still have one.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.407
What if we refuse?

14:47.843 --> 14:51.151
Then we take a far muddier path,

14:51.194 --> 14:54.023
and you will die running.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.331
Maman, where are you?

14:58.723 --> 15:00.464
It's just a game.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.553
Hide-and-seek. Find me.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.468
Maman!

15:04.512 --> 15:06.731
Hide-and-seek, indeed.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.433
You'll have to find us first!

15:13.695 --> 15:15.044
So be it.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.263
Fire.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.972
We need to get to the ship.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.188
-We got to get out of here.
-Okay.

16:58.539 --> 17:01.063
Soong no doubt has got
this place surrounded by now.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.934
So, what do you suggest?

17:02.978 --> 17:06.416
Can't go in, can't go out,
but we can go down.

17:06.460 --> 17:10.333
There are a series of tunnels
underneath this house.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.119
But where was the entrance?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.604
Think faster,

17:20.648 --> 17:23.433
or the memory will escape
through the hole in your head.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.917
Maman? Where are you?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.838
Mother?

17:36.881 --> 17:39.101
Mother, I know it's you.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.537
I know.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.715
My boy.

17:48.415 --> 17:49.894
Maman?

17:51.853 --> 17:53.420
Yes.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.858
Yes, I know.

17:56.901 --> 18:00.122
Why don't we continue
somewhere less bright,

18:00.166 --> 18:03.952
somewhere your cleverness
has fewer senses to draw from.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.131
We have to go.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.134
It's just a game--
hide-and-seek down below.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.226
But, Maman, Papa's forbidden me
from going down there.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.141
We'll go.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.143
Everything will be better.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.406
I won't be sad.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.104
You want to be with me?

18:26.148 --> 18:27.454
Then let's go.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.760
-Hurry.
-It's dangerous.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.154
You're my light, Jean-Luc.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.809
The light that always
draws me out.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.117
Guide your own way.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.814
Find me.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.823
Ah.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.434
-Picard!

18:53.349 --> 18:54.829
In here. Quick.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
Now.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.154
Mother?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.287
Mother, where are you?

19:19.332 --> 19:21.769
This isn't fun anymore.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.170
Maman?

19:39.003 --> 19:40.788
I've seen this place.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.833
In your mind.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.748
What happened here?

19:44.792 --> 19:47.273
During the Second World War,

19:47.316 --> 19:50.537
the French Resistance
converted this place

19:50.580 --> 19:52.930
as a storage for munitions

19:52.974 --> 19:55.629
and a way of communicating
with the front.

19:55.672 --> 20:00.329
And then they locked it all away
when the Nazis invaded.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.505
That's not what I meant.

20:04.072 --> 20:07.597
In your memory,
this place felt unusually dark.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.211
What happened?

20:14.909 --> 20:18.739
I followed my mother
down here...

20:18.782 --> 20:20.741
playing hide-and-seek.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.525
And...

20:23.918 --> 20:25.746
I lost her.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.838
Or rather, she lost herself.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.798
Yeah, this is a very dangerous
playground.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.278
Oh.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.801
My father used to say,

20:37.845 --> 20:39.977
"There are
a thousand ways to die."

20:40.021 --> 20:42.241
Thousand ways to die.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.460
Yvette? Jean-Luc?

20:45.896 --> 20:47.333
Jean-Luc!

20:50.379 --> 20:52.033
Jean-Luc!

20:54.731 --> 20:56.429
These tunnels should lead
to a hatch

20:56.472 --> 20:58.039
on the other side
of the vineyard.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.780
From there,
we can take back the ship.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.825
Let's go.

21:16.057 --> 21:17.406
Come on.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.800
Time to arm up.
We still got a job to do.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.413
Listen to you.
You sound like a captain.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.720
You know, you should have
joined Starfleet.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.332
I tried-- after Voyager.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.334
Starfleet shut me down
because...

21:32.378 --> 21:34.118
You were Borg?

21:34.162 --> 21:37.078
Janeway went to bat for me,
threatened to resign, but...

21:37.121 --> 21:39.341
I gave it up, went full Ranger.

21:41.604 --> 21:44.346
All right.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.784
We have a dozen Borg
between us and the ship,

21:47.828 --> 21:50.221
a 50-yard sprint
across open terrain,

21:50.265 --> 21:54.095
and all we have is
a knife and a corkscrew.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.749
And an ice pick.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.145
You really would make
a great captain.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.236
-When we get out of this...
-We're not getting out of this.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.241
Nope.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.895
Probably not.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.047
You can't hide forever,
you know.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.158
Hello.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.649
How is he?

23:09.692 --> 23:11.302
Fast asleep.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.435
Half of him is terrified,
and the other half thinks

23:13.479 --> 23:15.089
that was the coolest thing
he's ever seen.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.525
Reminds me of myself.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.179
God forbid.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.615
What are you doing?

23:19.659 --> 23:21.356
If I can rewire the subroutines,
then maybe I can

23:21.400 --> 23:22.923
regain command access
to this panel.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.446
I would like
to rewire your brain.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.752
Teresa, I have to get back.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.101
And you'll get
your friends killed

23:27.144 --> 23:28.494
because you're
too injured to help.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.060
Just because we anesthetized
your wound

23:30.104 --> 23:31.671
doesn't mean your arm is fine.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.542
Now, sit down.

23:34.935 --> 23:38.199
Which of these thingies
will help me extract a bullet?

23:38.242 --> 23:41.071
That one-- the tricorder there.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.856
-Really?

23:42.899 --> 23:45.162
An entire ER fits
in your pocket?

23:45.206 --> 23:47.034
Pretty cool, huh?

23:47.077 --> 23:50.516
You have no idea what
this is like for me, do you?

23:50.559 --> 23:54.476
A miracle cure...
surrounded by miracles,

23:54.520 --> 23:57.261
knowing win or lose,

23:57.305 --> 23:59.438
I'll have to let them go.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.273
Show me your arm.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.856
So, where are you, Picard?

25:04.851 --> 25:06.983
Search for other entrances.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.470
Jean-Luc?

25:17.037 --> 25:20.344
Maman? Are you in here?

25:30.354 --> 25:32.182
You won.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.490
And I'm lost.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.145
Let's go back up, okay?

25:38.188 --> 25:40.582
Have tea, eat supper.

25:40.626 --> 25:44.717
And tonight, you can teach me
more constellations.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.284
Stars.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.243
Yes, yes.

25:49.286 --> 25:54.074
Did you know that
space is so vast, so infinite,

25:54.117 --> 25:57.643
it takes billions of years
for that tiny pinprick of light

25:57.686 --> 26:02.778
to make that lonely journey
from its star to our eyes?

26:02.822 --> 26:05.433
The brilliance you see
in the night sky, Jean-Luc,

26:05.476 --> 26:07.696
that exquisite light,

26:07.740 --> 26:09.611
it's just an echo, really,

26:09.655 --> 26:12.135
of a star that has
long since faded.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.010
Like me.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.883
When you remember me,
Jean-Luc, promise...

26:20.927 --> 26:26.715
promise me you will ignore
the coldness of a dying star,

26:26.759 --> 26:29.675
and remember instead her light

26:29.718 --> 26:33.461
and the infinite love
she so very much had for you.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.682
Yvette! Yvette!

26:36.725 --> 26:39.075
Jean-Luc! Where are you?

26:42.122 --> 26:44.646
Remarkable.
I only saw this once,

26:44.690 --> 26:46.692
and that was through
the eyes of a child.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.651
And it's how you remember it?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.435
Come on. We have to go.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.828
It's just you and me.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.184
Maman! Maman!

27:02.751 --> 27:04.840
More or less.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.103
Jean-Luc!
Thank God, there you are.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.457
What became of your mother?

27:13.501 --> 27:15.329
I found her,

27:15.372 --> 27:18.680
but my father took her
and locked her in that room.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.553
Please!

27:22.597 --> 27:24.599
Let me out, Jean-Luc.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.209
Please.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.385
Only you can save me.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.432
Only you can save me.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.694
Let me out.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.262
Let me out, Jean-Luc!

27:37.568 --> 27:39.701
So I opened the door.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.574
-What was that?

27:43.618 --> 27:44.663
They found us!

27:45.794 --> 27:47.100
There. That door.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.191
It's locked.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.329
Yes!

28:05.031 --> 28:06.467
Get away.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.447
Told you
you couldn't hide forever.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.885
Who said I was hiding?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.115
Raffi?

28:47.769 --> 28:50.119
Elnor?

28:50.163 --> 28:52.208
I'm not Elnor.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.993
At least, not exactly.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.779
But real enough to say
how good it is to see you.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.912
I've missed you, Raffi.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.218
-We don't
have much time.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.568
Maybe if I can access
the ship's systems...

29:04.612 --> 29:05.918
Seven, the systems are locked,

29:05.961 --> 29:07.789
for which I am the key.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.574
Jurati concealed the coding
engram within me to secure it.

29:10.618 --> 29:12.794
She's still in there
fighting the Queen.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.927
-Elnor, can you give me access?
-Hang on. Hang on.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.625
If we unlock the ship's
main systems,

29:17.668 --> 29:19.192
she can access them.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.194
We'll be giving the Queen
exactly what she wants.

29:21.237 --> 29:23.283
And if we don't, we have no way
to defend against her.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.328
Just trust me, I have an idea.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.943
-Ship's system unlocked.
-All right.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.684
I need to open a hatch and clear
a pathway to the transporter.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.251
Stand by.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.992
E-Elnor, wait.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.907
L-Listen to me.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.606
Look, I... I know
you're not really him.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.783
I know that.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.220
I didn't keep you with me

29:47.263 --> 29:50.353
because I was afraid
of you being by yourself.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.183
I kept you back...

29:54.227 --> 29:57.665
because I was frightened
of me being alone.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.842
Raffi...

30:00.886 --> 30:03.845
I share the recollection
of Elnor's final breath,

30:03.889 --> 30:06.195
enough to know that
his last thoughts of you

30:06.239 --> 30:08.284
were not of blame...

30:08.328 --> 30:09.982
but of love.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.421
All right, the way is clear.
Let's go.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.428
Which way?

30:28.696 --> 30:30.872
The left goes deeper
into the château.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.353
The right goes to the fields.
Come on.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.399
Oh. No.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.706
-All right.
-This way!

30:39.707 --> 30:41.230
Come on.

30:41.274 --> 30:42.928
Accessing transporters.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.671
Uh, whatever you're doing,
do it faster.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.848
I'll hold them off
as long as possible.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.025
Seven?

31:04.384 --> 31:08.475
Well, we seem to be regaining
the advantage.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.390
Are we nearly out?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.827
There's an exit in the solarium.
Come on.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.918
Your plan was successful.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.225
I detect only one Borg
still on board.

31:25.535 --> 31:26.928
-Seven.
-I see her.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.887
Transporting her to the brig.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.283
She has a transport inhibitor.

32:00.614 --> 32:03.704
Three against one
hardly seems fair.

32:03.747 --> 32:07.055
Jurati, please don't
make us do this.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.317
I know you're in there.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.319
I know you can fight.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.626
We've got you dead to rights.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.628
Do you?

32:21.504 --> 32:23.506
Seven! No!

32:24.507 --> 32:27.249
Computer, transfer
primary controls to me.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.956
Computer, set course
for the Delta Quadrant.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.220
We have 400 additional years
to expand the collective.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.179
She's gonna die
if I can't stop the bleeding.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.964
Don't do this.

32:46.007 --> 32:49.141
I have absorbed
millions of languages,

32:49.184 --> 32:52.187
and there are a few
common words among them.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.363
Love, certainly.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.149
Hope and fear.

32:57.192 --> 33:00.456
And one more common still.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.459
-Futility.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.941
Species thrive without love.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.814
Kingdoms conquer without fear.

33:10.858 --> 33:15.210
But it is the imperfect nature
of all organic things

33:15.254 --> 33:17.778
to fight an unwinnable battle

33:17.821 --> 33:20.259
against an undefeatable foe.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.783
Death.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.096
Now we can get to the ship.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.625
I'm no stranger
to lost lab rats.

33:38.668 --> 33:43.021
To catch one, you don't
follow it through the maze.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.980
You force it to the surface.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.913
Why am I crying?

34:05.956 --> 34:07.915
Those aren't your tears.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.569
They're mine.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.920
Those same chemicals
you used to take control--

34:12.963 --> 34:15.270
dopamine and adrenaline--
aren't just produced

34:15.314 --> 34:17.446
by a few drinks
and a torch song.

34:18.447 --> 34:21.929
Sadness, loss, despair.

34:23.104 --> 34:25.846
Basically, what happens
when you hurt my friends.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.022
That cooks the same neural soup,
only this time,

34:28.066 --> 34:29.719
it allowed me to wrestle
some control back.

34:29.763 --> 34:30.981
Impossible.

34:31.025 --> 34:32.461
You might be well on your way

34:32.505 --> 34:34.289
if you had just shown
a little mercy.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.950
Soong.

34:42.993 --> 34:47.128
You don't understand the future
you're about to create.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.566
Thriving, prosperous.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.656
I'm told we're beloved
across the galaxy.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.702
Feared.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.106
What is this?

35:08.149 --> 35:09.803
The history of the Borg.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.632
Well, the only history
that matters-- the ending.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.330
How it always ends for you.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.985
A lone Borgslayer,
a united Federation,

35:18.028 --> 35:20.161
they come for you--
for your top-shelf,

35:20.205 --> 35:22.555
overreaching,
Icarus-worthy arrogance.

35:22.598 --> 35:26.036
If prattling on is your choice
of weapon, I can wait.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.517
-You can't be sad forever.
-Do the math.

35:28.561 --> 35:32.130
In this or any other universe,
you always lose.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.741
That's why you fight so hard.

35:34.784 --> 35:37.178
You live with the death knell
of your species

35:37.222 --> 35:39.093
across infinite timelines.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.530
You fear loss, just like we do.

35:42.531 --> 35:45.273
You long for
what we all long for.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.190
Connection...

35:49.234 --> 35:51.801
longevity, discovery.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.892
Only you offer it
without choice.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.112
I'm saying...

35:58.156 --> 36:00.245
what if we ask for it?

36:00.288 --> 36:01.985
You and I.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.205
Finally, the semblance
of a point.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.730
The galaxy is filled with lives
that need saving.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.734
One of them is lying
at your feet right now.

36:11.778 --> 36:14.694
We have to create
our own destiny.

36:14.737 --> 36:18.001
Captains of ships
and captains of industry,

36:18.045 --> 36:20.090
to men like us,

36:20.134 --> 36:22.310
love and fear...

36:22.354 --> 36:24.356
the same thing.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.880
A means to an end.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.230
You'd have a cohort
pulled from the dying?

36:29.274 --> 36:31.232
Recruit from derelict ships?

36:31.276 --> 36:33.103
Flotsam of space?

36:33.147 --> 36:35.105
You'd have us collect scraps?

36:35.149 --> 36:37.934
And offer second chances.

36:37.978 --> 36:42.243
What if we take this ship
and build a better Borg?

36:42.287 --> 36:46.247
A real collective based not
on assimilation but salvation.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.294
Think about it:
a Borg collective that embraces

36:49.337 --> 36:51.296
the uniqueness of its members.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.298
You ask us to embrace weakness.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.561
I'm positing that what
you've written off as weakness

36:55.604 --> 36:57.302
is actually strength.

36:57.345 --> 36:59.217
Cooperation.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.090
Your proposal is absurd.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.921
But not entirely un-intriguing.

37:07.964 --> 37:12.926
Imagine, members who would fight
harder for what they chose.

37:14.362 --> 37:16.886
Who would lose no battles
because they made no enemies.

37:16.930 --> 37:20.542
Who would not be discarded
and replaced.

37:20.586 --> 37:24.067
Attachments could grow
and deepen.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.462
Like Seven.

37:27.506 --> 37:30.291
-Didn't you love her once, too?

37:31.292 --> 37:33.773
And wasn't she...

37:33.816 --> 37:36.384
the best of what we could be?

37:36.428 --> 37:39.300
Somebody who used her Borg half

37:39.344 --> 37:42.129
to serve the best
of her humanity.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.265
Let's build a universe
of Sevens.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.530
Let's start with this one.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.012
Shame, really.

37:56.056 --> 37:57.840
In another future,

37:57.884 --> 38:01.104
I imagine we might have
become friends.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.196
Goodbye, Picard.

38:09.548 --> 38:11.593
System rebooting.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.639
-Think I've got it.
-Ten percent.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.684
What if I don't want you
to get it?

38:15.728 --> 38:17.512
-What if I don't want you to go?
-20%.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.384
What if I want to see
your face again

38:19.427 --> 38:20.907
or something crazy like that?

38:20.950 --> 38:23.953
Teresa, I don't belong here.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.608
Why? The future has
enough heroes already.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.088
-Don't you think?
-40%.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.916
Believe me,
I've thought about it.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.439
I really have.

38:31.483 --> 38:33.311
This isn't my time line.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.574
-The future's yours. It's his.
-60%.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.316
I'm just trying to protect it.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.318
What if your future is here

38:40.361 --> 38:42.276
and it was always
supposed to be?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.930
80%.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.245
95%.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.030
Teresa, I...

39:13.002 --> 39:14.395
No, please.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.223
Please don't-don't do this.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.399
Please don't.

39:35.721 --> 39:37.723
-No, you're killing her!

39:47.994 --> 39:51.389
I bet you don't have to be from
the future to fire this thing.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.217
No.

39:54.261 --> 39:58.221
But you do need to have
the right DNA to unlock it.

39:58.265 --> 40:01.355
You hold it too long,
and, well...

40:01.399 --> 40:02.661
boom.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.416
She'll live.

40:23.029 --> 40:26.119
But there is a cost
in saving her.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.607
Jurati?

40:37.043 --> 40:38.827
Is that you?

40:39.828 --> 40:41.351
Yes.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.919
No.

40:45.181 --> 40:47.793
I think we are becoming
something new.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.448
Something better.

40:50.491 --> 40:51.884
Seven...

40:56.889 --> 40:58.934
I have to get to the ship.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.198
You're welcome, by the way.

41:08.248 --> 41:11.033
Let me out, Jean-Luc.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.861
Please.

41:15.995 --> 41:18.345
So I opened the door.

41:22.741 --> 41:25.787
I'm having the strangest memory.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.790
Follow it.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.879
See where it leads.

41:37.799 --> 41:40.541
There are moments in time

41:40.585 --> 41:43.196
we wish we could travel back to.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.155
Memories.

41:46.199 --> 41:49.550
Pieces of life
better lived in reverse.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.858
In those moments,

41:52.901 --> 41:58.428
tragic endings might rewind
into joyful beginnings.

41:58.472 --> 42:02.389
Moments of loss
into those of gains.

42:03.564 --> 42:07.263
I... remember now,

42:07.307 --> 42:12.225
in a cloudy moment
of extreme melancholy,

42:12.268 --> 42:16.621
my mother hung herself
here in this place.

42:17.709 --> 42:20.407
And for all I've lived,
all I've seen and done,

42:20.450 --> 42:23.279
I suppose this is the moment

42:23.323 --> 42:26.369
I've kept myself
from remembering,

42:26.413 --> 42:30.286
this moment I am so powerless
to reverse.

42:32.114 --> 42:35.857
My mother was ill, I'm told,

42:35.901 --> 42:39.469
but I only ever thought
she was...

42:39.513 --> 42:41.646
inspired.

42:42.647 --> 42:45.693
That night, my father
had locked her into her room

42:45.737 --> 42:47.913
for her own safety.

42:47.956 --> 42:51.177
Perhaps for mine, as well.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.658
But she begged me to help her,

42:53.701 --> 42:56.661
told me how much she needed me,

42:56.704 --> 42:59.925
how much she needed my help.

43:03.189 --> 43:06.758
And this is the part
I've spent my whole life

43:06.801 --> 43:09.717
trying not to remember.

43:09.761 --> 43:12.241
I thought I was saving her.

43:13.678 --> 43:16.158
So, after he fell asleep,

43:16.202 --> 43:18.596
I let her out, you see.

43:19.597 --> 43:23.078
If only I had left
that door closed,

43:23.122 --> 43:26.691
she might have become
an old woman.

43:26.734 --> 43:31.521
I used to imagine
seeing her older,

43:31.565 --> 43:33.915
offering me a cup of tea...

43:35.874 --> 43:38.354
...and asking for a chat.

43:41.227 --> 43:43.011
This skeleton key

43:43.055 --> 43:45.448
migrated all over the house.

43:47.407 --> 43:50.932
I wish, that day,
it hadn't ended up in my hand.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.197
I loved her.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.810
Desperately.

44:00.725 --> 44:04.250
Love can be a source
of great grief

44:04.293 --> 44:06.295
and immense pain.

44:06.339 --> 44:08.471
Of tremendous guilt.

44:10.169 --> 44:12.606
A reason to run from ourselves

44:12.650 --> 44:15.087
or away from each other.

44:17.437 --> 44:19.874
Love can be a curse.

44:21.571 --> 44:24.357
But always and completely...

44:25.532 --> 44:27.490
...it's a gift.

44:59.740 --> 45:01.742
I've been this, I've been...

45:03.701 --> 45:06.965
...Seven much longer
than I was ever Annika.

45:07.966 --> 45:09.968
It was just nice to...

45:11.491 --> 45:13.058
...be ordinary.

45:15.669 --> 45:17.715
Well, that's impossible.

45:17.758 --> 45:22.371
Because no matter how you come--
Borg or human--

45:22.415 --> 45:26.898
you are the most extraordinary
person I know.

45:30.466 --> 45:33.643
You know, all your life,
you've been running from these,

45:33.687 --> 45:35.602
from this.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.300
And I can't help but wonder

45:38.344 --> 45:40.433
how much more
you'd be capable of,

45:40.476 --> 45:43.784
how much more you could be,

45:43.828 --> 45:46.178
if you just stopped.

45:49.137 --> 45:50.791
It's time to go.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.101
We can't let her do this.

45:56.144 --> 45:58.407
Whatever she promised, we can...

46:01.367 --> 46:03.761
Whoever you are now,

46:03.804 --> 46:07.242
half of you is our friend.

46:07.286 --> 46:09.592
Maybe in time,
all of you could be.

46:10.855 --> 46:14.380
In time, perhaps.

46:14.423 --> 46:17.078
But now a deal must be honored.

46:18.079 --> 46:22.388
A ship for a life
is more than a fair exchange.

46:22.431 --> 46:25.608
And please inform your admiral,

46:25.652 --> 46:29.047
the future will have no need
for a Borgslayer.

46:29.090 --> 46:31.049
At least not from us.

46:31.092 --> 46:33.834
And tell him this:

46:33.878 --> 46:36.619
The mission must not
be postponed.

46:36.663 --> 46:39.274
To succeed,
there must be two Renées.

46:39.318 --> 46:41.581
One who lives

46:41.624 --> 46:43.365
and another who dies.

47:29.455 --> 47:31.283
-She took my ship.
-My ship.

47:31.326 --> 47:34.155
She gave it to the Queen--
Jurati--

47:34.199 --> 47:36.244
i-in exchange for Seven's life.

47:39.857 --> 47:41.336
Seven.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.251
Are you all right?

47:45.950 --> 47:48.126
I'm myself.

47:53.609 --> 47:56.395
Well, we've lost a friend,

47:56.438 --> 47:58.963
but we've regained ourselves.

47:59.006 --> 48:02.270
And we will need all ourselves

48:02.314 --> 48:04.272
if we are to succeed.

48:04.316 --> 48:06.622
Soong is still in the wind.

48:06.666 --> 48:08.450
And he's definitely not
the quitting type.

48:08.494 --> 48:10.626
Your ship may have slipped
through his fingers,

48:10.670 --> 48:13.499
but he'll find other means
to stop the Europa Mission.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.370
-And Renée.
-Or worse.

48:15.414 --> 48:18.852
Picard, before Agnes left,
she had a message for you:

48:18.896 --> 48:21.855
In order to succeed,
there must be two Renées.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.466
One who lives
and another who dies.

48:24.510 --> 48:28.818
I refuse to accept an outcome
that has not yet occurred.

48:28.862 --> 48:30.908
Come. We have work to do.
