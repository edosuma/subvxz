00:03.470 --> 00:04.871
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.904 --> 00:06.206
- LET'S ACCEPT THESE SIX

00:06.239 --> 00:07.273
THAT YOU DID A GREAT JOB
GETTING.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.109
- SIX DEALS IN SEVEN DAYS,
FULL ASK,

00:09.142 --> 00:10.710
IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS
OF MY CAREER.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.711
CHING-CHING!

00:11.745 --> 00:13.013
- YOU HAVE ONE WEEK.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.148
YOU SELL ONE UNIT, YOU HAVE
THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.149
- OKAY.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.584
IF WE CAN PICK UP THAT PHONE

00:17.617 --> 00:19.986
AND WE CALL ABSOLUTELY
EVERYBODY, WE WILL FIND A BUYER.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.521
WHO'S WITH ME?
[applause]

00:21.554 --> 00:24.391
- NO OPEN HOUSES.
NO WALKING AROUND.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.493
SHOW YOUR BROKERS
SOME PHOTOGRAPHS.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.761
- I MEAN,
THAT'S, LIKE, 20 PEOPLE.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.662
IF PAT FOUND OUT I WAS MAKING
A MUSIC VIDEO

00:29.696 --> 00:31.564
IN HIS APARTMENT,
HE'D CHOP MY NUTS OFF.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.669
- I WILL SELL YOU THE WHOLE
BUILDING IN THE NEXT WEEK.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.971
- I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.
THIS DEAL IS DEAD.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.174
[upbeat music]

00:41.207 --> 00:42.676
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:42.709 --> 00:46.646
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.949
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:49.983 --> 00:51.418
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.987
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.656
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.391
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.126
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?
- I WANTED THIS THING

01:00.160 --> 01:01.895
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:01.928 --> 01:03.196
- IT'S OVER!

01:03.229 --> 01:06.132

01:14.741 --> 01:15.842
[horn honks]

01:15.875 --> 01:17.177
- WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU SEEING?

01:28.588 --> 01:32.092
SO PAT FOUND OUT I SHOT
A MUSIC VIDEO IN HIS APARTMENT,

01:32.125 --> 01:36.096
AND HE IS PISSED.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.300
MY LISTING AT PENTHOUSE "B"
HAS BECOME A NIGHTMARE.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.769
- NO OPEN HOUSES,
NO PARTIES, NO RECEPTIONS.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.904
- PAT PUT SO MANY RESTRICTIONS
ON ME.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.639
I HAD TO THINK OF SOMETHING
TO GENERATE INTEREST,

01:46.673 --> 01:49.542
SO I MADE A MUSIC VIDEO.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.878
BUT THE PLAN DIDN'T REALLY
WORK OUT.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.548
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND,

01:55.582 --> 01:56.916
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME,
YOU'RE GONNA FIRE ME,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.118
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.154
I AM RESTRAINED IN SELLING
THIS APARTMENT

02:01.187 --> 02:03.123
TO THE EXTENT THAT I DON'T
THINK ANY OTHER BROKER

02:03.156 --> 02:04.958
HAS EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.393
I CAN'T HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.128
I CAN'T DO
THE NORMAL MARKETING

02:08.161 --> 02:10.397
BECAUSE WE AGREED
THAT I WOULD NOT DO THAT,

02:10.430 --> 02:12.132
AND THAT IS FINE, BUT YOU
SAID YOU WOULD ALLOW ME

02:12.165 --> 02:15.402
TO MAKE
A SMALL LISTING VIDEO.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.244
IF I MADE A SMALL LISTING VIDEO,
NO ONE WOULD HAVE WATCHED IT,

02:24.277 --> 02:26.513
BECAUSE EVERYBODY MAKES
LISTING VIDEOS.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.982
WHAT I DECIDED TO DO WAS
TO MAKE SOMETHING UNIQUE

02:29.082 --> 02:30.750
THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET
A LINK TO IT

02:30.784 --> 02:32.118
AND SEND IT TO THEIR FRIEND,

02:32.152 --> 02:33.186
WHO WILL SEND IT
TO THEIR FRIEND,

02:33.219 --> 02:34.354
WHO WILL PUT IT ON FACEBOOK,

02:34.387 --> 02:37.090
WHO WILL THEN TWEET IT,
JUST LIKE YOU GOT IT.

02:37.123 --> 02:39.726
AND IT'S ALREADY WORKING.
IT'S ALREADY WORKING.

02:44.130 --> 02:46.700
BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU WOULD SAY NO.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.967
I TOOK A BIG, BIG RISK,

02:48.001 --> 02:51.137
BUT THE GOAL IS TO SELL
THE APARTMENT.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.274
MUSIC VIDEO EQUALS SALE...
I HOPE.

02:57.410 --> 02:58.678
I AM WORKING HARDER FOR YOU

02:58.712 --> 03:01.414
THAN I'VE EVER WORKED
FOR ANYONE IN MY LIFE.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.260
OKAY.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.564
[upbeat music]

03:17.597 --> 03:18.832

03:18.865 --> 03:20.467
- ARE YOU FREDRIK?
- HI.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.936
- MY NAME IS DR. BALLU.
THIS IS JASMIT.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.170
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M FREDRIK EKLUND. HI.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.505
- JASMIT CHADHA.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.873
- TODAY, I'M MEETING
MY NEW CLIENTS.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.475
THEY ARE DEVELOPERS AND OWNERS

03:28.508 --> 03:30.477
OF A BUILDING, 50 LISPENARD,

03:30.510 --> 03:32.112
IN NORTHEAST TRIBECA.

03:32.145 --> 03:35.348
JUST RECENTLY, I SOLD SIX UNITS
IN THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR,

03:35.382 --> 03:38.952
46 LISPENARD, IN A WEEK,
I MIGHT ADD.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.620
WE HAVE A DEAL?
- YES.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.088
- OKAY.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.523
AND I'VE HEARD OTHER BROKERS
DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT

03:43.556 --> 03:45.625
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ME.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.327
- WE'VE HEARD YOU'VE GOT
A TREMENDOUS REPUTATION.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.996
- WHEE! THAT'S ME.
LET ME SEE IT, LET ME SEE IT.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.265
- WELL, LET'S SHOW YOU
INSIDE THEN.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.101
- 50 LISPENARD
IS AN AMAZING BUILDING.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.837
IT HAS FOUR TWO-BEDROOM UNITS,
FULL FLOORS,

03:57.871 --> 04:00.674
AND THEN, ON TOP OF IT ALL,
A DUPLEX PENTHOUSE

04:00.707 --> 04:02.075
WITH THREE TERRACES.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.810
- SO, THIS IS
OUR PENTHOUSE FLOOR.

04:03.843 --> 04:08.515
- WHOA!
THIS IS SO COOL, SO DRAMATIC.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.050
I LOVE IT.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.053
[upbeat music]

04:13.053 --> 04:17.057
* *

04:17.057 --> 04:20.293
IT'S AMAZING, HAVING
THE VIEW OF TRIBECA AND SOHO.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.228
I LOVE THIS DRAMATIC GLASS,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.631
ADDED ON TO THE OLD BRICK,
BEAUTIFUL BUILDING.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.166
WELL DONE.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.702
THE PENTHOUSE
AT 50 LISPENARD IS INCREDIBLE,

04:28.735 --> 04:30.970
BUT FOR A PENTHOUSE,
IT'S A LITTLE SMALL.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.673
STAGING IS A MUST HERE.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.276
SO, GUYS, WHY HAVEN'T YOU
PICKED A BROKER?

04:36.309 --> 04:37.744
- WELL, WE'VE MET
A LOT OF BROKERS,

04:37.777 --> 04:39.913
AND THE SINGLE QUESTION
I ASK IS,

04:39.946 --> 04:42.449
"CAN YOU SELL
A SINGLE UNIT?"

04:42.482 --> 04:45.085
AND THEN YOU GET THE REST
OF THE UNITS FOR YOURSELF.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.120
SO FAR, THE ANSWER TO THAT
HAS BEEN NO.

04:47.153 --> 04:49.255
- I JUST NEED TWO MORE DAYS.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.559
- WE SPOKE ABOUT ONE WEEK.
WE'RE DONE. THAT'S IT.

04:52.592 --> 04:56.830
- OKAY, SO I UNDERSTAND
THAT THE LOWER UNITS WILL LIST

04:56.863 --> 04:58.865
A TAD BELOW $3 MILLION.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.533
BUT LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE PENTHOUSE.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.569
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.872
- BUT IT NEEDS HELP.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.307
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

05:07.340 --> 05:09.642
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT SOME MONEY
INTO STAGING THIS

05:09.676 --> 05:11.711
AND MAKING IT BEAUTIFUL,
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.913
YOU'RE GONNA GET
THAT MONEY BACK TEN TIMES.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.851
- WE GOT A CALL FOR $25,000.
WHAT IS YOUR STAGING CHARGE?

05:17.884 --> 05:19.686
- I CAN IMAGINE IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT MORE THAN $25,000.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.721
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.156
- WE WANT YOU TO PAY FOR IT.

05:23.189 --> 05:27.060
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU WANT ME
TO PAY YOUR BILLS?

05:27.093 --> 05:29.896
- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE HAVE
INVESTED IN THIS PROPERTY

05:29.929 --> 05:31.164
IS CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.801
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ACTUALLY PAY
NO MORE THAN THAT.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.971
- I DON'T PAY FOR ANYTHING.
THAT'S THE SELLER'S BILL.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.975
BUT IT'S FIVE APARTMENTS.
IT'S A BIG COMMISSION.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.577
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PRICING
HERE FOR THE PENTHOUSE.

05:44.611 --> 05:49.816
I THINK, FOR NORTHEAST TRIBECA,
BEAUTIFUL, BUT NO DOORMAN,

05:49.849 --> 05:52.419
$3.8 MILLION.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.754
- I THINK WE CAN GET MORE
THAN THAT.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.423
- HOW MUCH?

05:56.456 --> 05:59.926
- I THINK 4.2.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.529
- WHEW!
YOU WANT $2,400 A FOOT?

06:02.562 --> 06:04.898
- ABSOLUTELY.

06:04.931 --> 06:08.702
- I SOLD 46 LISPENARD NEXT DOOR
FOR ALMOST $1,400 A FOOT.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.036
IT WAS A RECORD.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.373
AND NOW, THESE TWO ARE USING
MY OWN COMPS AGAINST ME.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.208
YES, IT IS A PENTHOUSE,

06:15.241 --> 06:18.345
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE $1,000 PER
SQUARE FOOT MORE THAN NEXT DOOR.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.813
THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

06:19.846 --> 06:23.850
- IT'S GONNA BE PRICELESS.
- [laughs]

06:23.883 --> 06:27.187
LET ME THINK FOR A SECOND.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.056
IF YOU SIGN WITH ME TODAY,
I'LL PAY FOR THE STAGING,

06:30.090 --> 06:32.659
BUT WE'RE GONNA PRICE THIS
AT $4 MILLION.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.829
NOT AS HIGH AS YOU WANT,
BUT HIGHER THAN WHAT I WANT.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.465
THAT'S A FAIR DEAL, GUYS.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.569
LET'S COMPROMISE.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.637
- CAN YOU DELIVER?

06:44.671 --> 06:45.905
- OH, I CAN DELIVER.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.107
I'M GONNA CALL EVERYONE

06:47.140 --> 06:50.944
WHO LOST OUT ON THAT BUILDING
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.179
- WE'RE READY TO MOVE AHEAD.
- GREAT.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.148
IT'S AMAZING TO HAVE
A WHOLE NOTHER BUILDING.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.651
MY STRATEGY HERE
IS TO FOCUS ON THE PENTHOUSE.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.855
ONCE THE TOP IS SOLD,
I'M GONNA WORK MY WAY DOWN.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.390
- THANK YOU, FREDRIK.
- I APPRECIATE IT.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.557
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.
- THANK YOU.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.292
- LOTS OF THINGS TO DO.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.895
WHOO!
FIVE MORE UNITS!

07:08.928 --> 07:12.032
[upbeat music]

07:12.032 --> 07:13.633
* *

07:13.667 --> 07:17.270
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO
TO 2 RIVER TERRACE.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.605
THANK YOU, SIR.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.041
LOSING THE LISTING ON
LISPENARD WAS VERY HARD ON ME,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.308
BUT I NEED TO GET
BACK OUT THERE.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.610
I DO NOT GIVE UP.

07:23.643 --> 07:26.212
I ALREADY HAVE A NEW LISTING
IN BATTERY PARK CITY.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.883
2 RIVER TERRACE IS NOT
YOUR AVERAGE BUILDING.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.519
MAJOR CELEBRITIES ARE THERE--
LEONARDO DICAPRIO,

07:32.552 --> 07:34.754
TYRA BANKS, ADAM LEVINE.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.755
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING
TO BE IN.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.924
- WHO IS IT?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.860
- THERE HE IS. OH, MY GOD.
THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.328
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?

07:42.362 --> 07:44.230
- GOOD.
- VERONICA, HOW ARE YOU?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.632
- I'M GOOD.
HELLO, LUIS.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.833
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.168
VERONICA IS AN OLD CLIENT
OF MINE WHO I SOLD

07:48.201 --> 07:49.669
THE APARTMENT THAT
SHE CURRENTLY LIVES IN

07:49.703 --> 07:51.838
SIX MONTHS AGO
FOR $2.2 MILLION.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.073
BUT NOW, BECAUSE OF WORK,

07:53.073 --> 07:54.441
SHE HAS TO MOVE
BACK TO SINGAPORE,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.843
SO SHE HAS ASKED ME TO HELP
HER SELL THE APARTMENT AGAIN.

07:56.876 --> 07:57.844
BOOM!
- AAH!

07:57.877 --> 07:59.412
- VERONICA HAS A SON,
ARTHUR,

07:59.446 --> 08:01.881
AND HE LOOKS AT ME
AS A BIG BROTHER.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.783
AAH!

08:03.817 --> 08:06.586
SO VERONICA AND ARTHUR HAVE
BECOME ALMOST LIKE FAMILY TO ME.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.787
I KNOW YOU'VE DONE
SOME IMPROVEMENTS,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.422
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.425
[upbeat music]

08:12.459 --> 08:16.596
* *

08:16.629 --> 08:18.798
- UH, PUT IN THE BLINDS,
YEAH.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.200
- HOW MUCH WERE THEY?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.768
- IT WAS $45,000
TO DO THE WHOLE HOUSE.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.138
- OKAY.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.942
- SO EVERY ROOM HAS GOT
CUSTOM-MADE CLOSETS, CABINETRY.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.611
- AND IT'S VERY GOOD MATERIAL.
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.912
- HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.848
- NEARLY $50,000
TO DO THE WHOLE HOUSE.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.216
- THE BUILT-IN CLOSETS,
THAT DEFINITELY ADDS VALUE.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.484
- YEAH, IT DOES.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.919
- SO WE HAVE THE SHADES,
WE HAVE THE CUSTOM CLOSETS.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.695
- SO, LET'S--LET'S TALK
ABOUT PRICING.

08:48.728 --> 08:49.763
- YES.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.731
- I'M THINKING,
SIX WEEKS FROM NOW,

08:51.765 --> 08:55.502
I'D LIKE TO BE GONE,
AND, I MEAN, IDEALLY FOR ME,

08:55.535 --> 08:57.370
I'D LIKE TO RELEASE
MY CAPITAL

08:57.404 --> 08:59.406
THAT I'VE GOT INVESTED
IN THIS PLACE.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.107
- EH, WELL,
IT'S ONLY BEEN SIX MONTHS

09:01.141 --> 09:02.308
SINCE YOU FIRST BOUGHT IT,

09:02.342 --> 09:04.878
AND IT'S VERY TOUGH FOR
APARTMENTS TO APPRECIATE

09:04.911 --> 09:06.846
IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.249
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO BE
REALISTIC ON THE PRICE.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.151
- SO, WHAT'S COMPARABLE?
- THERE'S NO COMPARABLES.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.154
THERE IS ACTUALLY NO MORE
THREE-BEDROOMS IN BATTERY PARK,

09:14.187 --> 09:15.922
BUT WE STILL HAVE
TO PRICE IT ACCORDINGLY,

09:16.022 --> 09:17.357
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
IS BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.125
SINCE PEOPLE KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU BOUGHT IT FOR,

09:19.159 --> 09:20.460
BECAUSE IT'S PUBLIC RECORDS,

09:20.493 --> 09:22.328
THEY WANT TO COME IN AND SAY,
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO--

09:22.362 --> 09:26.032
I DON'T WANT TO OVERPAY MORE
THAN SHE DID SIX MONTHS AGO.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.101
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE A LOSS.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.270
TO BE FAIR, WE'VE DONE
SOME CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.673
- POTENTIAL BUYERS ARE NOT
GOING TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION

09:33.707 --> 09:36.042
HOW MUCH MONEY SHE HAS SPENT
ON RENOVATION.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.546
THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT HOW MUCH
SHE BOUGHT IT SIX MONTHS AGO.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.047
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS
IN OUR ADVANTAGE.

09:41.047 --> 09:44.250
WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL APARTMENT
THAT IS IN PERFECT CONDITION,

09:44.284 --> 09:47.120
AND THAT FACT THAT IT'S THE
ONLY ONE ON THE MARKET TODAY,

09:47.153 --> 09:49.389
AND NOW BATTERY PARK
AFTER SANDY

09:49.422 --> 09:52.125
HAS BECOME EXTREMELY HOT BECAUSE
IT WAS THE ONLY BUILDING

09:52.158 --> 09:54.060
IN THE ENTIRE SOUTH
OF 14TH STREET

09:54.094 --> 09:55.128
THAT DID NOT LOSE POWER.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.363
SO, I THINK,

09:56.396 --> 10:01.634
AT ABOUT $12.64 A FOOT--

10:01.668 --> 10:04.504
- HMM.
- WHICH TAKES US TO ABOUT 2.65.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.439
I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HIGHER,

10:06.473 --> 10:08.842
BUT I THINK WE CAN STILL GET,
YOU KNOW,

10:08.875 --> 10:12.212
WE CAN GET--WE CAN GET SOME--
WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO COME IN.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.614
PRICING IT LIKE THAT
IS A STRATEGY TO GET INTEREST

10:14.647 --> 10:16.816
AND ENOUGH ROOM FOR US
TO NEGOTIATE.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.352
I WILL TRY MY BEST TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T LOSE A DIME.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.354
- LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.722
- THANKS, LUIS.
- ARTHUR, COME HERE.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.357
LET'S HAVE A LAST FIGHT.
ROUND 12.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.625
[claps]

10:25.658 --> 10:28.161
LET'S GO.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.329
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE PAINT.
YOU DO THE FURNITURE.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.730
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.198
MY OPEN HOUSE
IS THIS WEEKEND.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.566
EVERYTHING
NEEDS TO BE PERFECT.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.135
- DO YOU LIKE IT?

10:44.744 --> 10:46.980
- OKAY, LOVE,
THIS IS THE BIG DAY.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.049
I'M EXCITED TO GET STARTED.
- ME TOO. LET'S DO IT.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.885
- MY OPEN HOUSE
AT THE PENTHOUSE AT 50 LISPENARD

10:51.918 --> 10:53.386
IS THIS WEEKEND,

10:53.420 --> 10:57.090
WHICH MEANS I NEED
TO GET IT STAGED IMMEDIATELY.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.892
LIKE, IN ONE DAY.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.893
THE MOVING TRUCK'S COMING,
FIVE MINUTES?

10:59.926 --> 11:00.894
- IT'S COMING.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.629
- I HIRED CHERYL

11:02.662 --> 11:04.464
BECAUSE SHE'S THE BEST STAGER
IN NEW YORK CITY,

11:04.497 --> 11:06.533
AND SHE'S WORTH EVERY PENNY
I PAY HER.

11:06.566 --> 11:07.934
LET'S MAKE THIS PLACE
BEAUTIFUL.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.337
- LET'S DO IT.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.971
- THIS PLACE IS PERFECT
FOR A YOUNG AND HIP COUPLE,

11:12.072 --> 11:14.174
AND THE STAGING
NEEDS TO REFLECT THAT--

11:14.207 --> 11:17.877
YOUNG, HIP, SLEEK,
DING!

11:17.911 --> 11:19.379
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE PAINT.
YOU DO THE FURNITURE.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.414
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.083
AND SINCE THERE'S
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE,

11:23.116 --> 11:25.952
I'M GONNA HELP CHERYL.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.454
CHERYL!

11:27.487 --> 11:30.090
DON'T YOU THINK
IT SHOULD BE A LIGHTER COLOR?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.092
- NO. THIS IS GONNA ADD,
LIKE, DRAMA.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.260
- DRAMA? WHERE'S THE DRAMA?
- LEAVE THE DESIGN PART TO ME.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.729
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

11:35.762 --> 11:37.664
- THAT'S A LOT OF GRAY,
I'LL TELL YOU.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.835
- THANKS. PERFECT.
- NO.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.937
CAREFUL!
DON'T HIT THAT THING!

11:43.970 --> 11:46.673
WATCH THE FLOORS!
BE CAREFUL WITH THE FLOORS!

11:46.706 --> 11:47.941
CLOCK IS ALWAYS TICKING.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.344
I FEEL LIKE
NO ONE'S LISTENING TO ME.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.246
WHERE DO YOU WANT THEM?
- RIGHT THERE IS GOOD.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.948
- NO, I DON'T LIKE THAT.
OVER HERE.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.549
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

11:56.583 --> 11:57.717
THIS AREA AND THAT AREA
LOOKS PERFECT BEFORE THE--

11:57.751 --> 11:59.119
- I HAVE IT.
I'VE GOT THIS.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.053
IT'S GONNA LOOK PERFECT.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.654
JUST STAY OUT OF MY WAY
A LITTLE.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.223
- THESE LISTINGS
ARE LIKE MY BABIES.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.525
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME. I LOVE THEM.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.360
BE CAREFUL.
I'M TRUSTING YOU.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.396
DON'T GET ME IN TROUBLE HERE,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE CLIENT.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.798
- I WON'T. I'VE GOT THIS.
- GET THE MASTER GOING!

12:11.831 --> 12:15.468
- HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO WORK.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.471
[funky music]

12:18.505 --> 12:20.140
* *

12:20.173 --> 12:21.641
- LOOK AT ALL THESE BALLOONS.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.076
BATTERY PARK CITY,

12:23.109 --> 12:25.912
IT'S A PLACE THAT IT'S MOSTLY
KNOWN FOR FAMILIES.

12:25.945 --> 12:29.149
WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
MAYBE, UH, MAYBE A DINOSAUR.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.084
SO, MY PLAN FOR THE OPEN HOUSE
FOR 2 RIVER TERRACE

12:31.084 --> 12:32.886
IS TO DO SOMETHING FOR KIDS.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.288
LOOK, ARTHUR, THIS WAY.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.290
IF I'M DOING A KIDS-FRIENDLY
OPEN HOUSE,

12:37.323 --> 12:41.127
I NEED TO BRING THE BEST MAN
TO LET ME UNDERSTAND

12:41.161 --> 12:43.229
HOW KIDS THINK,
AND THAT'S ARTHUR.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.433
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME
PICK OUT AS MANY TOYS,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.768
AS MANY BALLOONS,
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN,

12:48.802 --> 12:50.937
'CAUSE WE'RE GOING TO USE THEM
FOR THE OPEN HOUSE.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.839
- OKAY.
- [laughs]

12:52.872 --> 12:54.107
THE MORE TIME I SPEND
WITH ARTHUR,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.009
THE MORE IN LOVE I AM
WITH HIM.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.111
- HOW ABOUT THESE?
- YOU WANT ALL OF 'EM?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.679
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

12:59.713 --> 13:02.082
OH, LOOK AT THE BOXING GLOVES.
REMEMBER? FOR FIGHTS.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.084
LOOK AT THIS,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.386
[laughs]

13:06.419 --> 13:09.055
ARTHUR, LET ME GO!
- NO!

13:09.055 --> 13:10.357
- PLEASE.
- NO.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.958
- OKAY, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ESCAPE NOW.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.561

AND I BE THE POLICE, OKAY?

13:25.171 --> 13:27.240
- OKAY, I'M THE BAD GUY,
AND YOU'RE POLICE.

13:27.273 --> 13:28.775
I'M GOING TO ESCAPE.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.477
IF THE KIDS IN THIS OPEN HOUSE
ARE GOING TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN

13:30.510 --> 13:31.911
AS I'M HAVING RIGHT NOW,

13:31.945 --> 13:33.413
THE PARENTS ARE GOING
TO BE SO HAPPY

13:33.446 --> 13:35.548
THAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE
TO SELL THIS IN NO TIME.

- OKAY, LET'S GET
100 BALLOONS.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.496
I DON'T THINK WE MISSED
ANYTHING, RIGHT?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.697
- YEAH.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.799
- SO, NOW WE CAN
SELL THE HOUSE.

UP THERE.

A REAL TERRACE NOW.

I'VE BEEN GETTING
A LOT OF CALLS

15:13.847 --> 15:16.316
FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE
THE APARTMENT,

15:16.349 --> 15:18.551
WHICH IS GREAT,
BUT IT MAKES ME NERVOUS

15:18.585 --> 15:21.588
BECAUSE PEOPLE
CAN'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.056
[doorbell rings]

15:23.089 --> 15:24.190
HELLO.

JUST TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.229
THE OWNER WILL COME THROUGH
WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.331
UM, IF I COULD JUST ASK
THAT YOU TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.438
MY CLIENT LOVED IT,

JUST TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF?

15:40.240 --> 15:43.176
HERE IS A SHOW SHEET, AND WE'LL

16:06.900 --> 16:09.602
- BEAUTIFUL. AND WHAT KIND
OF WALLS ARE THESE?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.439

16:33.059 --> 16:35.495
- MY PARENTS
ARE BUYING ME A PLACE, AND--

16:35.528 --> 16:37.263
- YOUR PARENTS ARE BUYING YOU
A PLACE?

- YEAH.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.800
- DO YOU NEED A BROTHER?

DO YOU WANT TO BE MY BROTHER?

- AND IT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY GOOD SIZE, RIGHT?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.021
- THIS COULD ALSO BE,
LIKE, THE KIKI ROOM.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.389
- WHAT IS A KIKI?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.524
- IT'S LIKE,
BEFORE YOU GO OUT, LIKE,

17:04.557 --> 17:06.459
YOU JUST TRY ON LOTS
OF DIFFERENT CLOTHES

17:06.493 --> 17:09.863
AND YOU BLAST MUSIC
AND HAVE A KIKI.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.297
- SWEET.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.432
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

DON'T NEED TO SEE THIS?

17:19.172 --> 17:21.441
THEY'RE JUST GONNA LET YOU
MAKE A DECISION?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.843
- HMM, YEAH.
I MEAN, PRETTY MUCH.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.947
FAJA JUST WANTS
TO MAKE ME HAPPY, SO...

17:28.048 --> 17:30.684
- FAJA WHAT?
WHO'S FAJA?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.753
- FAJA? OH. MY DAD.
- YOUR DAD'S NAME IS FAJA?

17:33.787 --> 17:35.622
- NO, NO, "FAJA" IS
JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

17:35.655 --> 17:39.392
A LITTLE FATHER-DAUGHTER
TYPE THING.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.095
- YOU HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP
WITH FAJA THEN, HUH?

17:42.128 --> 17:44.764
- YEAH.
I'M A PRINCESS.

17:44.798 --> 17:45.865
- AND THIS IS
A PRINCESS'S APARTMENT.

17:45.899 --> 17:46.866
- [laughs]

17:46.900 --> 17:48.868
- AND THE PRICE IS OKAY?

17:48.902 --> 17:53.807
- UM, I MEAN, I WOULD
JUST LEAVE FAJA UP TO ME.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.241
I'LL TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THE PRICE.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.243
IT SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.478
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.779
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE
TO COME THROUGH.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.247
THIS IS AWESOME.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.450
I'M SUPER EXCITED
THE MUSIC VIDEO ACTUALLY WORKED.

18:03.483 --> 18:08.288
CLEARLY, CORA AND FAJA
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP,

18:08.321 --> 18:10.023
AND I'M BANKING ON IT.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.191
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.859
- PERFECT.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.228
- YES, BRING A BUYER.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.763
- I-I WANTED TO GO
TO THE OPEN HOUSE

18:16.796 --> 18:19.366
BECAUSE EMOTIONALLY I GOT
VERY ATTACHED TO THIS PROJECT.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.668
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME
DOING THIS OPEN HOUSE.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.649
- [grunts]
NO, NO, NO!

18:36.683 --> 18:39.386
GETTING FAMILIES IS EXTREMELY
CRUCIAL AT THIS OPEN HOUSE

18:39.419 --> 18:41.287
TO BE ABLE TO SELL
THIS APARTMENT QUICKLY.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.223
ARTHUR!
LOOK WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.192
- AWESOME!
- WOW! LOOK AT THIS!

18:46.226 --> 18:47.594
- I'M SORRY I'M BRINGING
SO MUCH BALLOONS,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.796
BUT HE ASKED FOR 100,
AND 100 I GAVE.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.131
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT THAT WAY!

18:51.164 --> 18:52.599
BRING IT
TO THE LIVING ROOM.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.334
- RRARR!
- THAT'S IT.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.736
- HELP ME BREAK THIS ONE.
- YEP.

18:56.770 --> 18:58.405
- WHAT IS THAT?
YOU POP ONE?

18:58.438 --> 19:00.740
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- [laughs]

19:00.774 --> 19:02.575
OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THIS.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.677
- ARTHUR, WE'RE GONNA GO.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.146
- I WANT TO STAY HERE
AND HELP LUIS.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.214
[laughter]

19:08.248 --> 19:09.582
- HE CAN STAY?
- YEAH, HE CAN STAY.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.750
- ALL RIGHT, ARTHUR,
YOU'RE MY NEW ASSISTANT.

19:10.784 --> 19:12.185
COME HERE.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.653
WHILE HE ENTERTAINS THE KID
IN ONE ROOM,

19:13.687 --> 19:15.855
I CAN TALK TO THE PARENTS,
SO IT'S A PERFECT COMBINATION.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.691
NOW WE GET THE KIDS,
AND WE ENTERTAIN, OKAY?

19:17.724 --> 19:21.628
- I CAN EAT ALL THE CUPCAKES,
RIGHT?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.129
- DON'T EAT ALL THE CUPCAKES.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.397
[doorbell rings]

19:24.431 --> 19:25.598
HELLO.
- HI.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.034
- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
<i>HOLA.</i>WELCOME.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.503
THIS IS THE ONLY THREE-BEDROOM
ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW

19:30.537 --> 19:31.705
ON THE NORTH COVE
OF BATTERY PARK.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.273
IT'S 2,095 SQUARE FEET.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.541
THREE BEDROOMS,
FOUR FULL BATHROOMS.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.809
- VERY NICE.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.346
[overlapping chatter]

19:39.379 --> 19:40.647
- TAKE AS MANY
AS YOU WANT.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.215
YOU HAVE FOUR EXPOSURES.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.917
YOU HAVE WEST, NORTH,
EAST, AND SOUTH.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.385
SO, THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.853
- OH, THE--THANKS!

19:46.886 --> 19:49.589
- BALLOONS, BALLOONS.
BALLOONS, BALLOONS, BALLOONS.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.057
- ARTHUR,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:51.057 --> 19:53.193
- BALLOONS, BALLOONS,
BALLOONS, BALLOONS.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.131
[balloons popping]

19:58.164 --> 19:59.699
- ARTHUR, ARTHUR!
PLEASE, ARTHUR.

19:59.733 --> 20:00.767
I WILL GIVE YOU
100,000 CUPCAKES--

20:00.800 --> 20:01.768
[balloon pops]

20:01.801 --> 20:02.802
JESUS CHRIST!

20:02.836 --> 20:04.938
I HAVE NEVER HOSTED
AN OPEN HOUSE

20:04.971 --> 20:07.307
WHEN MY OWN RIGHT-HAND MAN
IS RUNNING AROUND,

20:07.340 --> 20:10.010
HIGH ON SUGAR AND EATING
ALL THE CUPCAKES.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.479
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL DESIGN
FROM THE SPONSOR.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.646
IF YOU CAN SEE ON THE BACK--

20:13.680 --> 20:15.849
[Arthur makes noise
with mouth on balloon]

20:15.882 --> 20:16.916
YOU HAVE
A TOP-INSTALL SHOWER.

20:16.950 --> 20:19.753
- HEY, NO, NO, NO.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.887
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.222
[balloon pops]
AAH!

20:22.255 --> 20:23.423
[balloons popping]
OH!

20:23.456 --> 20:25.058
IT'S ALL CHAOS,
AND BALLOONS ARE EXPLODING,

20:25.091 --> 20:26.893
AND MY HEAD IS NOT--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE [bleep] GOING ON,

20:26.926 --> 20:29.262
BUT I NEED TO GET IT
UNDER CONTROL.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.363
HELLO.
- HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.631
- HOW ARE YOU? LUIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.266
- NICE TO MEET YOU. SHARON.
- THE PLEASURE IS MINE.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.934
SO, UH, WELCOME
TO THE SPACE.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.870
- THANK YOU. I'M ACTUALLY
LOOKING ON BEHALF OF A CLIENT.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.039
THEY'RE ACTUALLY OUT OF
THE COUNTRY AT THE MOMENT,

20:39.072 --> 20:40.674
SO THEY'VE ASKED ME
TO REPRESENT THEM TODAY.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.941
THEY DON'T HAVE AN AGENT,

20:41.975 --> 20:43.877
BUT TRUST ME TO HAVE A LOOK
ON THEIR BEHALF.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.279
- OKAY. HERE IS
THE THIRD BEDROOM.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.014
- BEAUTIFUL VIEW.
VERY ROOMY.

20:48.048 --> 20:50.016
- DA MAH MAH MAH MAH.

20:50.050 --> 20:52.218
- I HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION
IN THE--IN THE WEBSITE,

20:52.252 --> 20:53.353
AND YOU CAN CALL ME ANYTIME.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.487
I BARELY SLEEP.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.423
- FANTASTIC.
- I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.490
- THANK YOU.
WONDERFUL TO HAVE MET YOU.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.491
[balloon pops]
- OH! SORRY.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.659
- [laughs]

20:59.693 --> 21:02.696
[jazzy music]

21:02.729 --> 21:11.571
* *

21:11.604 --> 21:13.640
- IN REAL ESTATE,
IT'S ALL ABOUT

21:13.673 --> 21:15.308
BRINGING ATTENTION
TO A PROPERTY.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.776
[pounding]

21:16.810 --> 21:19.312
SO, I THOUGHT, THIS PENTHOUSE
IS LIKE A GALLERY SPACE.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.314
BIG WALLS,
DRAMATIC, HIGH CEILINGS.

21:21.348 --> 21:24.517
AND BY MAKING THE OPEN HOUSE
AN ART GALLERY OPENING,

21:24.551 --> 21:27.454
I GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING EXTRA
TO TALK ABOUT.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.222
IF IT HAPPENS TO BE MY ARTWORK
THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT,

21:29.255 --> 21:30.490
EVEN THE BETTER.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.125
THAT'S MY FIANCE.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.361
HE'S ACTUALLY NAKED, BUT YOU
CAN'T SEE THAT UNDERWATER.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.528
[doorbell rings]

21:35.562 --> 21:37.964
OH, HI, GUYS.
HI, I'M FREDRIK. HI.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.466
WELCOME TO 50 LISPENARD.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.401
COME TO THE TERRACE
AND EXPERIENCE THE VIEW.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.937
IT'S 1,800 SQUARE FEET
INTERIOR,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.172
AND THEN WE HAVE ALMOST 1,000
SQUARE FEET OF OUTDOOR SPACE.

21:46.206 --> 21:48.274
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS INSANE.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.110
WHAT'S SO MAGNIFICENT--
OBVIOUSLY THE DRAMA,

21:50.110 --> 21:53.279
THE CEILING HEIGHTS,
ALL THIS GLASS.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.514
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT HAS IT ALL?

21:54.547 --> 21:55.782
- THIS APARTMENT
HAS IT ALL.

21:55.815 --> 21:56.783
[laughter]

21:56.816 --> 22:00.420
[jazzy music]

22:00.453 --> 22:01.921
- YEAH, NO, THE PHOTOS
ARE A GREAT IDEA.

22:01.955 --> 22:03.757
- THANK YOU. YOU CAN
BUY THEM IF YOU WANT.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.858
- OH, REALLY?

22:04.891 --> 22:05.859
- I THINK
IT'S ONE-OF-A-KIND,

22:05.892 --> 22:06.860
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THOSE TWO TERRACES HERE.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.495
- YEAH.
- AND ANOTHER TERRACE UPSTAIRS.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.130
- I THINK IT NEEDS TO HAVE
A GLASSED-IN SHOWER.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.065
- OKAY.
LET ME LOOK INTO IT.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.400
I LIKE PICKY BUYERS.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.670
PICKY BUYERS
ARE USUALLY BUYERS.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.673
[Latin music]

22:19.706 --> 22:21.841
- I WANTED TO GO
TO THE OPEN HOUSE

22:21.875 --> 22:24.611
BECAUSE EMOTIONALLY I GOT VERY
ATTACHED TO THIS PROJECT.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.379
I HAD A CHANCE
TO REPRESENT IT,

22:26.413 --> 22:29.716
BUT IT SLIPPED
THROUGH MY HANDS.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.184
- YOU'RE DONE.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.686
TOMORROW MORNING, I'VE GOT
TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.387
THIS DEAL IS DEAD.

22:34.421 --> 22:36.122
- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE,

22:36.156 --> 22:37.524
AND I'M, LIKE,
TRYING TO ENTERTAIN EVERYONE.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.758
I JUST WANT TO SELL IT.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.560
- I HAVE NOT MET FREDRIK
BEFORE.

22:40.593 --> 22:44.431
HE IS A TOP BROKER,
AND IT CLEARLY SHOWS.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.267
AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT HIM
DOING THIS AMAZING OPEN HOUSE

22:47.300 --> 22:48.902
AND EVERYBODY
ENJOYING THEMSELVES,

22:48.935 --> 22:52.105
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT I'M DISAPPOINTED.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.240
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME DOING
THIS OPEN HOUSE.

22:54.274 --> 22:55.742
- YES, BRING A BUYER.
BRING A BUYER.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.143
$4.5 MILLION,
THAT'S A STEAL.

22:57.177 --> 22:59.145
- SENOR, HOW ARE YOU?
LUIS ORTIZ.

22:59.179 --> 23:00.780
HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

23:00.814 --> 23:03.616
- VERY IMPRESSED, MAN.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.485
THE APARTMENT IS AMAZING.
DOUBLE-HEIGHT CEILINGS.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.786
- I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
- THREE TERRACES.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.588
YOU'VE SEEN THIS?
- BUT NEVER LIKE THIS.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.057
YES.
- OH.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.093
OH, SO THAT'S
ONE OF THOSE BROKERS

23:13.126 --> 23:14.494
THAT COULDN'T SEAL THE DEAL.

23:14.527 --> 23:18.164
- BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M VERY IMPRESSED, MAN.

23:18.198 --> 23:19.566
I MEAN, THE OPEN HOUSE
IS AMAZING,

23:19.599 --> 23:21.735
AND THERE WAS CLEARLY
SOMETHING THAT I MISSED

23:21.768 --> 23:24.804
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS
THAT HE DID NOT.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.340
IF I LEARN WHAT THAT IS,
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE

23:27.374 --> 23:28.775
I DON'T MISS IT THE NEXT TIME.

23:28.808 --> 23:32.779
LISTEN, IF YOU HAVE TIME,
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU OUT

23:32.812 --> 23:34.881
JUST TO TALK,
MAYBE OVER DRINKS.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.082
I MEAN THAT.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.917
- YOU AND ME, DRINKS?
- YES.

23:37.951 --> 23:39.085
I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
AND, YOU KNOW,

23:39.085 --> 23:40.120
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO LEARN THINGS.

23:40.153 --> 23:41.488
- OH, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.624
- MOST AGENTS WOULD SEE FREDRIK
AS EITHER COMPETITION OR,

23:44.657 --> 23:46.659
EVEN WORSE, AS AN ENEMY.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.629
HOWEVER, FOR ME, IT'S ALL
ABOUT LEARNING FROM THE BEST,

23:49.662 --> 23:50.930
AND I THINK HE'S ONE OF THEM.

23:50.964 --> 23:52.232
ALL RIGHT, MAN, GOOD NIGHT.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.434
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.236
- DID YOU?

23:56.269 --> 23:58.004
- THE NIGHT WAS A TRUE SUCCESS
BECAUSE OF THE TURNOUT

23:58.104 --> 24:00.306
AND THE REACTION
TO THE APARTMENT.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.574
- IT'S HARD TO FIND
OUTDOOR SPACE IN TRIBECA.

24:01.608 --> 24:02.842
- YEAH.

24:02.876 --> 24:04.377
- THE PENTHOUSE
IS NOW READY FOR OFFERS.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.147
THANK YOU.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.182
- I WANT ONE OF YOU,
SHIRTLESS.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.620
I'LL GOOGLE YOU.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.830
- OH,
I LOVE THE OPEN MARKET.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.632
DO WE HAVE TIME TO, LIKE,
JUMP IN HERE FOR A SECOND?

24:25.665 --> 24:28.435
- ALWAYS HAVE TIME TO SHOP.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.803
- OOH, TIES.
- YOUR FAVORITE.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.471
- I LIKE THIS ONE.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.073
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THIS?

24:33.106 --> 24:35.542
- DO YOU HAVE A STYLIST,
OR IS THIS ALL YOU?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.143
- IT'S ALL ME, BABY.
- HMM.

24:37.177 --> 24:38.445
- BUT I PUT IT TOGETHER

24:38.478 --> 24:40.080
WHEN I'M STUMBLING AROUND
IN THE DARK,

24:40.080 --> 24:41.114
TRYING TO KICK YOUR FRIENDS
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.549
- AH.
[cell phone rings]

24:42.582 --> 24:44.117
- OH, WHO IS THIS NUMBER?

24:44.150 --> 24:46.152
HELLO?

24:49.956 --> 24:52.826
OH, HEY, CORA,
HOW ARE YOU?

24:52.859 --> 24:54.327
GOOD.

24:54.361 --> 24:56.496
SO DID YOU LIKE
THE APARTMENT?

24:56.529 --> 24:59.532
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED
PRETTY GOOD IN IT.

25:05.138 --> 25:07.240
[whispering]
FAJA. DID I TELL YOU ABOUT FAJA?

25:12.412 --> 25:14.848
WHAT'S THE SMALL DETAIL?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.188
WAIT, I COULDN'T
REALLY HEAR YOU.

25:22.222 --> 25:26.760
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
DID YOU SAY 6.5?

25:26.793 --> 25:29.863
[groans]
THAT'S PRETTY LOW.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.466
I MEAN, WE'RE--THAT'S LIKE
A MILLION DOLLARS OFF.

25:37.137 --> 25:39.239
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID

WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

26:08.335 --> 26:09.536
I WAS HOPING THAT CORA

THAT IS A VERY,
VERY LOW NUMBER, SHARON.

28:25.205 --> 28:29.843
THE REASON I PRICED IT AT 2.65

YES, THERE WAS 20 APARTMENTS
THAT WERE AVAILABLE.

SINCE WE'RE FIGHTING TIME,

- $7 MILLION.
- $7 MILLION?

33:23.136 --> 33:26.306
- $7 MILLION. TO GET A SEVEN
IN FRONT OF THE NUMBER...

33:26.339 --> 33:29.642

33:29.676 --> 33:32.545
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING.

- ONE MORE THING, WHAT?

33:33.847 --> 33:35.415
- THEY--UM, THEY DO--

33:35.448 --> 33:38.785
THEY REALLY LIKED
SOME OF THE STUFF IN THERE.

- STUFF?

33:40.086 --> 33:42.622
- YEAH, LIKE,
ALL OF THE FURNITURE.

33:42.655 --> 33:46.292
- THEY WANT ALL OF THE FURNITURE
AS PART OF THE DEAL?

33:46.326 --> 33:47.994
THEY CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.730
- THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU
$7 MILLION FOR THIS APARTMENT,

33:50.764 --> 33:54.668
WHICH HAS MOSTLY SOUTH-FACING
VIEWS, NOT ALL PARK.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.269
YOU KNOW, YOU BOUGHT IT
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

33:56.302 --> 33:58.505
AND YOU PUT A LOT OF WORK
INTO IT, BUT YOU PAID--

33:58.538 --> 33:59.939
- A LOT OF WORK.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.341
- BUT YOU PAID A LOT LESS

34:01.374 --> 34:03.309
THAN WHAT THIS PERSON'S WILLING
TO PAY YOU FOR IT TODAY.

34:03.343 --> 34:07.247
SO WHAT I LOOK AT IS
THE OVERALL NET RETURN TO YOU,

34:07.280 --> 34:10.383
WHICH IS--WHICH IS AWESOME.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.688

TEN YEARS AGO.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.223
THAT'S AN INSANE RETURN
ON HIS INVESTMENT.

34:17.257 --> 34:19.292
IT'S LIKE ALMOST TRIPLE.

34:19.325 --> 34:21.361

- I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT
AND YOU'RE BEING A SALESMAN,

34:23.329 --> 34:24.531
AND THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

34:24.564 --> 34:28.101
MY CONCERN
IS THAT $1/2 MILLION

34:28.134 --> 34:30.970
FOR MY RENOVATION
IS THE FURNITURE, SO, YEAH,

34:31.071 --> 34:33.540
YOU'VE COME UP
FROM $6.5 MILLION TO $7,

34:33.573 --> 34:35.508
BUT YOU GAVE THEM VALUE
FOR THAT.

34:35.542 --> 34:36.876
HELP ME WITH THE MATH.

34:36.910 --> 34:39.145
- I HONESTLY THINK THAT
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS

34:39.179 --> 34:41.147
KIND OF THE WRONG WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

34:41.181 --> 34:42.582
BECAUSE WHEN WE DECIDED
WHAT THE LISTING PRICE WAS--

34:42.615 --> 34:43.817
- RIGHT.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.385
- IT WAS A LITTLE BIT--

34:45.418 --> 34:48.288
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT BIASED
TO THE EMOTIONAL TIE

34:48.321 --> 34:50.390
TO THAT APARTMENT,
BUT IT WASN'T BASED

34:50.423 --> 34:52.959
ON WHAT THE ACTUAL MARKET VALUE
WAS, RIGHT?

34:52.992 --> 34:54.994
SO THE MARKET VALUE,
HONESTLY,

34:55.095 --> 34:56.763
IF YOU JUST WANTED TO SELL THIS
TOMORROW,

34:56.796 --> 34:58.932
IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT
ON THE OPEN MARKET, LET'S GO,

SOMEWHERE AROUND $6 MILLION.

WILLING TO PAY $7 MILLION,

WENT ON THE MARKET.

THEY KNOW IT'S A GOOD DEAL.
YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD DEAL.

35:20.687 --> 35:22.188
