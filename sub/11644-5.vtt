00:22.200 --> 00:25.839
No, I don't love him. I love you.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.839

01:26.680 --> 01:29.199
you're telling me you wouldn't treat

Who was it?

05:14.440 --> 05:15.519
I don't know.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.919

That is not a pleasant way to die.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.479

05:21.480 --> 05:24.359
No. I'm universally popular
and well-liked.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.879
Why would anyone want to kill me?

05:27.880 --> 05:29.399
I can think of a few reasons.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.199
Definitely.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.079
Shitloads.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.439
You annoy people.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.039
See, why would you even say
something like that?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.519
That's very hurtful.
I thought we were friends,

05:40.520 --> 05:42.039

05:42.040 --> 05:43.199
Don't speak to him like that.

Why are you sticking up for him?

05:46.320 --> 05:48.159
Do you love him?

05:48.160 --> 05:50.719
Oh, look, why don't you go and suck
yourself off?

05:50.720 --> 05:53.159
I wish I could.
I can never reach it.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.839
Oh, that is too wrong.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.999
Oh, come on, now.
We've all tried, huh?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.599
This one time, right,
I tied a rope to my feet

06:01.600 --> 06:03.799
and tried to yank them over my head.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.799

six pillows...

06:09.960 --> 06:11.439

06:22.560 --> 06:25.279

this conversation.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.479
Uh! You see, it must be
physically impossible.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.519
Cos, if men could
suck themselves off,

06:30.520 --> 06:34.079
then the female of the species
would be surplus to requirements.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.479
Oh, don't even think about it.

watching her getting changed.

08:15.360 --> 08:18.399
I am telling you.
The bitch killed me.

Are you going to do the run?

08:23.520 --> 08:25.759

No. I think you're beautiful.

here? Your height, kind of funny-looking?

Where is he?

10:07.400 --> 10:10.759
He went out the back door. Start
running if you want to catch him.

against a sink like this,

10:39.120 --> 10:43.119
until my brains dribbled out
of my ears.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.839
She wouldn't do that.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.519
How do you know?
You don't know anything about her.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.399
Come on, man.
It all adds up. Do the maths.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.399
There is no maths.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.359
Right. She was here,
plus no-one else was around.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.159

leering at her semi-naked.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.839

that happens to us.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.839

She's a beautiful girl and
she's here in the community centre.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.399
So?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.479
So, I remember a similar scenario
that resulted in me

11:20.480 --> 11:22.319

and that probation worker.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.679
And did you know that some of these
marathon runners shit themselves?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.959
So, you think that if a girl
likes me,

11:37.960 --> 11:40.839
there must be something wrong
with her?

16:10.559 --> 16:14.398
Well, she just killed some other guy!

Do you...do you want a drink?

16:44.559 --> 16:46.798
Er...yeah, I'll have a beer.

16:46.799 --> 16:47.838
All right.

16:47.839 --> 16:51.798
I got myself a problem

on something like this.

My mum died of cancer.

17:37.839 --> 17:41.838
And I wanted to do something,
so I set up this charity run.

17:44.199 --> 17:48.198
I'm sorry about your mum.

17:48.279 --> 17:51.038
So, what's with the community
service?

17:51.039 --> 17:52.718
What did you do?

17:52.719 --> 17:55.918
You didn't murder anyone, did you?

No.

if you don't want to.

I want you to know.

18:07.159 --> 18:09.158
I hit this girl.

It's your face.
You wanna get that sorted.

Come on.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.478
So, why are you here?

are big pals.

19:13.399 --> 19:16.398
What, and you are? Why are you here?

19:16.399 --> 19:19.038

I let on.

Where are we going?

20:09.359 --> 20:11.838
She's like one of
those evil bitch spiders.

and then they eat their own faeces.

20:17.439 --> 20:21.438
What?

20:28.479 --> 20:32.478
I really wanted to do that.

20:33.879 --> 20:37.878
Are you OK?

20:38.079 --> 20:39.518
Yeah.

Just hanging out.
You know.

21:20.639 --> 21:23.238
Were you following me?

21:23.239 --> 21:26.958
We could ask you the same thing.

21:26.959 --> 21:28.558
OK, yes.

21:28.559 --> 21:30.278
Look, we were worried about you.

21:30.279 --> 21:32.598
You don't need to be.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.398
Tell that to the dead guy
at the Community Centre, all right?

21:35.399 --> 21:39.398
Oh, wait, you can't, because
your new girlfriend killed him.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.198
Urgh!

21:56.199 --> 21:57.638
I'm squatting.

21:57.639 --> 22:01.638
It's just temporary.

Oh.

22:13.759 --> 22:15.598
I haven't got any beers.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.998
So, it was just some bullshit story
to get me back here?

22:45.799 --> 22:47.318
What?

22:47.319 --> 22:51.318
Kiss me.

22:59.799 --> 23:01.798

I meet you

I heard you got a brand-new name

Being you can't be easy... 

24:08.279 --> 24:12.278
If I had your power...
I'd wait until I was coming

24:13.279 --> 24:17.278
and I'd rewind a couple of seconds...
and just...

24:18.799 --> 24:22.438
hover in the moment.

24:22.439 --> 24:27.478
Oh! Oh!

24:27.479 --> 24:30.798
Zhoozh!

24:30.799 --> 24:33.558
(GASPS) Oh!

24:33.559 --> 24:36.318
Oh! Oh!

24:36.319 --> 24:38.438
You're too good at faking it.

24:38.439 --> 24:40.358
(LAUGHS)

24:40.359 --> 24:42.318
Most people would want to do
something useful,

24:42.319 --> 24:45.998
like go back in time
and kill Hitler or something.

24:45.999 --> 24:48.158
Right.

24:48.159 --> 24:51.678
But after...after I'm done killing
Hitler,

24:51.679 --> 24:55.678
I'm doing the thing with the orgasms.

25:04.342 --> 25:07.341
He was lying right here, all right?

25:07.342 --> 25:09.381
Blood was all pouring
out of his throat,

25:09.382 --> 25:11.421
and he was all gurgling and shit.
Urgh!

25:11.422 --> 25:14.421
So, where is he now?

25:14.422 --> 25:15.941
She's moved the body.

25:15.942 --> 25:19.941
Right, huh? Who leaves a dead body
lying around to be discovered?

25:19.982 --> 25:22.301
We never do and we're not exactly
the most competent killers.

25:22.302 --> 25:26.301
And how did she do that
when she was in the bar with me?

25:28.822 --> 25:31.341
Why would I make it up?

25:31.342 --> 25:32.501
Maybe you're jealous.

25:32.502 --> 25:35.101
Look at me - beautiful.

25:35.102 --> 25:38.141
Look at you - not so much.

25:38.142 --> 25:41.261
So, why am I here?

25:41.262 --> 25:43.061
I don't know.

25:43.062 --> 25:45.541
You stay away from Jessica.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.381
You stay away from her.

25:47.382 --> 25:49.741
No.

25:49.742 --> 25:53.741
Well, I think you should.

26:13.195 --> 26:17.034
I'm sorry I had to leave early
yesterday. I...

26:17.035 --> 26:20.834
It's fine.

26:20.835 --> 26:24.834
Er...the charity's having
a fancy dress party tonight.

26:26.195 --> 26:29.034
I thought you and your friends...

26:29.035 --> 26:32.114
I thought you might like to come.

26:32.115 --> 26:36.114
Thanks.

26:39.355 --> 26:43.354
Well, I...I should
get to the start.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.514
Come and find me afterwards.

26:46.515 --> 26:50.514
Good luck.

26:50.595 --> 26:54.594
Oh.

26:57.475 --> 26:59.954
Look, what's so difficult
to believe?

26:59.955 --> 27:02.114
Did you actually see her kill him?

27:02.115 --> 27:06.114
No. I didn't have to. It was written
all over her cute little face.

27:06.755 --> 27:12.114
I'm telling you, there's something
seriously wrong with this girl. Shh.

27:12.115 --> 27:16.114
Jessica's invited us
to a fancy dress party tonight.

27:19.315 --> 27:23.314
You know what?
You were right, man. I was jealous.

27:23.355 --> 27:25.154
I'm jealous of your, er...

27:25.155 --> 27:29.034
neat hair and your...
the strange staring

27:29.035 --> 27:31.794
that the ladies
seem to love so much.

27:31.795 --> 27:33.874
And I hope that you and, er...

27:33.875 --> 27:37.714
Jessica.Jessica.
Lovely, lovely Jessica.

27:37.715 --> 27:41.514
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

27:41.515 --> 27:43.714
You'll find your own girlfriend.

27:43.715 --> 27:46.834
All ready got one, mate.

27:46.835 --> 27:48.394
Who is she?

27:48.395 --> 27:51.034
(SIGHS)

27:51.035 --> 27:55.034
Mo...ni...ca.

27:58.075 --> 27:59.994
(CLEARS THROAT) She's French.

27:59.995 --> 28:02.994
You should invite her to the party.

28:02.995 --> 28:05.874
She's in France, what with
being all French and that.

28:05.875 --> 28:09.874
But seeing as this party's happening ten
feet from my bedroom, I will see you there.

28:18.235 --> 28:20.994
Are you serious?
When am I ever serious?

28:20.995 --> 28:24.394
But we need to be there
to keep an eye on her, right?

28:24.395 --> 28:26.154
It's a fancy-dress party.

28:26.155 --> 28:28.874
It's dark.
You'll all be wearing masks.

28:28.875 --> 28:32.874
It's the perfect opportunity
to commit murder. And incest!

28:33.035 --> 28:35.674
Who's Mo...ni...ca?

28:35.675 --> 28:38.154
That is the worst made-up name
I've ever heard.

28:38.155 --> 28:40.434
You know,
names never were my strong point.

28:40.435 --> 28:44.434
But I think
the whole French thing sold it.

28:44.595 --> 28:48.594
Prick!
Sorry, mate.

28:56.555 --> 28:59.194
What are you doing?

28:59.195 --> 29:03.194
I wanted to see you.

29:07.275 --> 29:10.354
There's this party tonight.
It's fancy dress

29:10.355 --> 29:14.354
and it'll probably be really shit.

29:14.595 --> 29:18.594
I'll be there.

29:24.835 --> 29:28.394
Boom-boom, baby
La-la, la-la, la-la

29:28.395 --> 29:31.994

30:00.755 --> 30:03.794
Take it easy! What you doing?

30:03.795 --> 30:07.794
Stop it! Get off!

30:07.915 --> 30:11.274
Fuck off!

30:11.275 --> 30:15.274
You hurt me!

30:30.952 --> 30:34.951
How did it go?
I beat my personal best.

30:35.232 --> 30:39.231
That's great.

31:03.152 --> 31:07.151
What?
I have something I have to tell you.

31:07.392 --> 31:10.231
Jess?
It's my dad.

31:10.232 --> 31:14.231
I'll tell you at the party.

31:16.552 --> 31:20.551
Dad. This is Simon.

31:23.232 --> 31:27.231
Hello, sir.

31:29.352 --> 31:33.351

31:38.872 --> 31:42.871
We should get some lunch.

31:51.192 --> 31:55.191
(CLICKS FINGERS) We should be
getting into our costumes!

31:55.232 --> 31:58.191
(SIGHS) What's up with you?

31:58.192 --> 31:59.631
Nothing.

31:59.632 --> 32:02.551
You haven't been this quiet
since you got turned bald.

32:02.552 --> 32:05.071
Can you leave us alone, yeah?
All right.

32:05.072 --> 32:09.071
Please, Nathan.
