00:02.063 --> 00:04.050
Hello, my darlings!

00:04.156 --> 00:06.121
- How is everyone today?
- Hi.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.968
In good voice, I trust.

00:09.406 --> 00:11.037
Thank you.

00:11.071 --> 00:13.273
Bella, darling,
you know what I think we should do?

00:13.307 --> 00:15.975
I think we should simplify it.
Let the hosts come in, introduce me,

00:16.010 --> 00:17.583
we'll pitch the charity a little bit,

00:17.636 --> 00:20.880
Broadway hearts for hearts, and, um...

00:20.915 --> 00:22.982
And remember...
When she gets to the first

00:23.017 --> 00:25.318
"the things we do for love,"
stand by for snow drop.

00:25.352 --> 00:26.819
Shall we?

00:28.756 --> 00:31.558
This number has always
been one of my favorites...

00:32.317 --> 00:36.296
A classic love song from back in the day.

00:38.265 --> 00:39.785
Stand by for cue.

00:40.207 --> 00:44.404
Communication is the problem to the answer.

00:45.053 --> 00:48.866
You've got his number,
and your hand is on the phone.

00:49.261 --> 00:52.712
The weather's turned,
and all the lines are down.

00:52.746 --> 00:54.547
The things we do for love.

00:54.984 --> 00:57.250
- ♪ The things we do for love.
- Cue snow. Cue snow.

00:57.284 --> 00:59.919
♪ Like walking in the
rain and the snow ♪

00:59.954 --> 01:02.388
- ♪ And there's nowhere to go
- Get the snow going.

01:02.423 --> 01:06.726
♪ And you're feeling like
a part of you is dying ♪

01:06.760 --> 01:10.563
♪ And you're looking for
the answer in his eyes ♪

01:10.598 --> 01:11.431
Need more snow than that.

01:11.465 --> 01:13.499
♪ You think you're gonna break up ♪

01:13.534 --> 01:15.868
♪ Then he says he wants to make up ♪

01:18.572 --> 01:20.740
Oh, my God!

01:26.988 --> 01:30.550
So, captain Beckett,
have you successfully completed

01:30.584 --> 01:32.285
your agenda for your lunch meeting?

01:32.319 --> 01:33.920
Indeed I did... Three times.

01:33.954 --> 01:35.306
Three?

01:35.556 --> 01:36.623
Best meeting ever.

01:36.657 --> 01:38.191
Who would have thought

01:38.225 --> 01:39.859
that secret dating would be so productive?

01:39.893 --> 01:42.061
I know.
Our public fights have made

01:42.096 --> 01:44.731
- our private time so much more...
- Intense.

01:44.765 --> 01:46.366
- Right?
- Yes.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.768
I don't suppose the captain
has time for one more agenda?

01:48.802 --> 01:50.703
Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could.

01:50.738 --> 01:53.573
But I have to make this meeting
with Captain Gates at 1PP.

01:53.607 --> 01:55.575
And is "Gates" code for "Vikram"

01:55.609 --> 01:58.511
and "1PP" your secret strip-club hideout?

01:58.814 --> 02:02.148
No. The meeting with Gates is very real.

02:02.182 --> 02:04.450
Look, Rick, I'm done playing lone wolf,

02:04.485 --> 02:07.120
and I promise you...
When the time is right,

02:07.154 --> 02:10.223
I will loop you in on everything Loksat.

02:12.693 --> 02:14.994
I-I mean,
I get that the whole thing is a covert op.

02:15.029 --> 02:17.764
I'm just saying...
I could be your secret weapon

02:17.798 --> 02:19.265
in taking Loksat down.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.001
Trust me, 007... When it's time,

02:22.036 --> 02:25.171
you and I will take down Loksat together.

02:25.205 --> 02:28.408
Meanwhile, I will be sneaking in and out

02:28.442 --> 02:31.077
of the building next door to get here.

02:31.111 --> 02:32.111
While I do what?

02:32.146 --> 02:34.013
Provide support and comfort.

02:34.048 --> 02:37.383
Lots and lots of comfort.

02:40.487 --> 02:41.454
Bye.

02:45.159 --> 02:46.693
Ah.

02:46.727 --> 02:47.694
Mother.

02:47.728 --> 02:49.095
How's your day going?

02:55.402 --> 02:56.536
Mother!

02:56.570 --> 02:58.638
Oh! Richard, darling.

02:58.672 --> 03:00.139
Thank God you're here.

03:00.174 --> 03:01.974
I came as soon as I could.

03:02.009 --> 03:04.143
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Don't worry about me.

03:04.178 --> 03:06.846
It's poor, sweet Robyn that
we should be thinking about.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.681
- You knew her?
- I just met her yesterday.

03:08.716 --> 03:11.551
She... she sat through an entire rehearsal,

03:11.585 --> 03:12.852
and then she waited around

03:12.886 --> 03:14.687
so she could come up and thank me.

03:14.722 --> 03:17.690
She was just...

03:17.725 --> 03:18.891
She was lovely.

03:19.708 --> 03:20.860
Darling, I want you to promise me

03:20.894 --> 03:23.296
that you will handle this case personally

03:23.330 --> 03:25.038
and find out who did this.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.400
Yeah, of course. Of course.

03:27.434 --> 03:29.235
Gram, why don't I take you home?

03:29.269 --> 03:30.302
Okay.

03:30.355 --> 03:32.070
Perfect. Thank you. Okay.

03:32.956 --> 03:33.706
Hey.

03:33.741 --> 03:35.408
Hey. How's Martha?

03:35.442 --> 03:36.709
Uh, shaken up.

03:36.744 --> 03:38.154
What happened?

03:38.879 --> 03:41.514
Victim is Robyn King, 20 years old.

03:41.548 --> 03:43.549
Works as the theater's night janitor.

03:43.584 --> 03:46.552
Based on lividity and body temp,
I estimate the time of death

03:46.587 --> 03:49.155
is last night between 9:00 and 11:00.

03:49.189 --> 03:51.958
Cause of death... Blunt-force trauma.

03:53.193 --> 03:55.862
Killer hit Robyn in the head,
stuffed her in the snow box,

03:55.896 --> 03:57.330
and lifted her up to the rafter.

03:57.364 --> 03:58.531
Where she bled out.

03:58.565 --> 03:59.532
Yo.

03:59.566 --> 04:00.635
This is Chris Jackson.

04:00.754 --> 04:03.069
He's the theater's production manager.

04:03.103 --> 04:05.371
Richard Castle.
So, you're the one who hired Robyn?

04:05.406 --> 04:07.874
Yes. And I was a little nervous at first.

04:07.908 --> 04:09.776
Robyn was an ex-con,

04:09.810 --> 04:12.430
but her parole officer pressed
me to give her a job...

04:12.483 --> 04:14.714
Promised that she was
completely trustworthy.

04:14.748 --> 04:17.683
And until last night,
there hadn't been a single problem.

04:17.718 --> 04:19.285
What happened last night?

04:19.319 --> 04:21.921
A woman showed up looking for Robyn,

04:21.954 --> 04:23.473
and she was pissed.

04:23.539 --> 04:24.490
And Robyn knew her?

04:24.525 --> 04:26.350
Oh, yeah. She called her "mama."

04:26.455 --> 04:29.695
But they clearly weren't a happy family.

04:29.730 --> 04:32.198
As I was leaving,
I heard Robyn threaten to call the cops

04:32.232 --> 04:34.267
if her mom ever came near her again.

04:35.189 --> 04:37.128
I shouldn't have left them alone.

04:37.247 --> 04:41.641
Robyn might still be alive if I had just...
stayed behind.

04:42.524 --> 04:43.576
Hey.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.745
So, here's a surprise.

04:45.779 --> 04:49.148
Robyn's records show that her
mother died when she was 5.

04:49.183 --> 04:51.150
- Then who's "mama"?
- Exactly.

04:51.185 --> 04:53.286
And here's another mystery that I found...

04:53.320 --> 04:54.921
According to Robyn's metrocard,

04:54.955 --> 04:57.490
she's been taking subway
trips up to Spanish Harlem

04:57.524 --> 05:00.326
two nights a week ever since
she was released from prison.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.595
Each time, she leaves around 11:30 P.M.,

05:02.629 --> 05:05.231
stays for almost two
hours before going home.

05:05.265 --> 05:07.733
Any indication in her financials
what she's doing up there?

05:07.768 --> 05:08.734
No, nothing yet.

05:10.704 --> 05:12.104
- I got to take that.
- Okay.

05:12.139 --> 05:12.972
Hey!

05:13.006 --> 05:14.640
Hey. So, I heard about Martha.

05:14.675 --> 05:16.175
Why didn't you pull me out of the meeting?

05:16.210 --> 05:17.643
You know what? I thought about it.

05:17.678 --> 05:20.279
But this whole new...
secret relationship...

05:20.314 --> 05:21.647
I wasn't quite sure what the rules were.

05:21.682 --> 05:22.915
Well, I-is she okay?

05:22.950 --> 05:24.417
Physically, yes. She's fine.

05:24.451 --> 05:26.185
Emotionally, not so much.

05:26.220 --> 05:28.821
She made me promise to help
track down Robyn's killer.

05:28.856 --> 05:30.823
Of course, but you know that publicly,

05:30.858 --> 05:31.824
I can't agree to that.

05:31.859 --> 05:32.859
What do you mean?

05:32.893 --> 05:34.327
Well, it means that I love you,

05:34.361 --> 05:37.163
but right now,
I'm gonna have to yell at you.

05:39.466 --> 05:40.366
Castle!

05:40.400 --> 05:42.969
We talked about this! You can't be here!

05:43.003 --> 05:45.538
Well, excuse me for living,
but I've got a damn good reason.

05:45.572 --> 05:47.607
I don't care what your reason is.

05:47.641 --> 05:49.675
You can't just waltz in
and out of my precinct

05:49.710 --> 05:50.877
whenever you want.

05:50.911 --> 05:52.945
Uh, my mother was traumatized, Captain.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.947
I'm involved in this case,
whether you like it or not.

05:54.982 --> 05:57.683
Fine. But you're on a short leash.

05:57.718 --> 06:00.820
Oh, I'll decide how short my leash is.

06:01.755 --> 06:05.057
Yo. Just got off the phone
with Robyn's parole officer.

06:05.092 --> 06:06.826
Look who I found... Robyn's mama.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.794
Olivia "mama" Toussaint.

06:08.829 --> 06:11.364
She's a mid-level dealer who
sells party drugs to rich kids.

06:11.398 --> 06:13.799
Robyn was part of her crew two
years ago when she got busted.

06:13.834 --> 06:14.800
What was Robyn arrested for?

06:14.835 --> 06:17.470
Uh, grand theft auto,
reckless endangerment,

06:17.504 --> 06:18.704
destruction of private property.

06:18.739 --> 06:20.573
Robyn made a delivery to a country club

06:20.607 --> 06:22.508
on long island,
decided to stay for the party.

06:22.543 --> 06:24.544
She got wasted, stole a car,
drove into a house...

06:24.578 --> 06:26.145
Half a million dollars' worth of damage.

06:26.179 --> 06:28.214
Got her two years in albion correctional,
too.

06:28.248 --> 06:30.816
So, with Robyn out on parole,
mama must have gone

06:30.851 --> 06:32.685
to the theater to bring
her back into the fold.

06:32.719 --> 06:35.154
But Robyn refused and
threatened to rat mama out.

06:35.188 --> 06:37.356
So mama silenced Robyn for good.

06:37.391 --> 06:39.091
All right, boys, bring her in.

06:39.126 --> 06:40.826
All right.

06:42.596 --> 06:46.832
Tell me...
is the "mama" meant to be ironic?

06:46.867 --> 06:50.369
Not very motherly having
underage kids run drugs for you.

06:50.404 --> 06:52.204
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:52.239 --> 06:53.906
What about the name Robyn King?

06:53.941 --> 06:55.541
Does that ring a bell?

06:55.576 --> 06:57.043
Sure. What of it?

06:57.077 --> 06:58.744
She did two years in prison for you.

06:58.779 --> 07:01.514
You probably thought
the $40 a month you put

07:01.548 --> 07:03.950
in her prison commissary
account would keep her loyal.

07:03.984 --> 07:05.751
But I'm thinking it didn't.

07:05.786 --> 07:07.286
That's why you stopped by the theater

07:07.321 --> 07:09.388
to lay down a little
oldfashioned motherly guilt.

07:09.423 --> 07:12.458
Or was it to strong-arm
her back onto your crew?

07:12.492 --> 07:15.695
I went there to check on her,
make sure she was okay.

07:15.729 --> 07:17.930
We got a witness that says you
were angry when you showed up.

07:17.965 --> 07:20.299
What can I say? She hurt my feelings.

07:20.334 --> 07:21.801
Yeah. Kids.

07:21.835 --> 07:23.069
They don't call, they don't write.

07:23.103 --> 07:24.604
Tell me about it.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.205
You think they'd show a little gratitude

07:26.240 --> 07:28.351
instead of dumping you for a new family.

07:28.942 --> 07:30.676
Is that why you killed her?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.278
'Cause she started running
with that other crew?

07:32.312 --> 07:34.113
I didn't kill her, Detective.

07:34.148 --> 07:36.549
I went there, I said my piece, I left.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.717
And I can prove it.

07:37.751 --> 07:39.552
This new family...

07:39.586 --> 07:41.587
They wouldn't happen to live
in Spanish Harlem, would they?

07:41.622 --> 07:42.889
Hell if I know.

07:42.923 --> 07:45.191
Robyn said she hooked
up with them in prison

07:45.225 --> 07:47.393
and that they had a big thing coming up.

07:51.799 --> 07:53.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.635
How'd it go with mama?

07:55.669 --> 07:58.304
Oh, her, uh, alibi checks out.

07:58.338 --> 08:00.106
She was in a cab by 8:15.

08:00.140 --> 08:04.777
And it looks as though Robyn
was working with a new crew.

08:04.812 --> 08:06.263
Uh...

08:06.847 --> 08:08.881
I had a really great time earlier.

08:08.916 --> 08:10.483
Me too.

08:10.517 --> 08:12.251
Is it wrong that I want
to kiss you right now?

08:12.286 --> 08:13.958
So wrong, it's right.

08:15.489 --> 08:17.657
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

08:17.691 --> 08:19.859
You're a jerk!

08:21.495 --> 08:23.229
Whoa.

08:23.263 --> 08:24.497
H-hey, bro, you okay?

08:24.531 --> 08:25.572
Yeah.

08:25.652 --> 08:27.900
No. Ow! Man, she hits hard.

08:27.935 --> 08:30.136
Look, Castle, I-it's clearly not okay,

08:30.170 --> 08:31.137
you being here.

08:31.171 --> 08:32.337
Yeah, you better go home.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.640
We'll call you if we find anything.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:04.004 --> 09:05.338
You're right.

09:05.372 --> 09:07.673
The bubbles... very soothing.

09:09.009 --> 09:10.943
Mother. What are you doing here?

09:10.978 --> 09:12.778
You should be at home, resting.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.814
Please. How can I possibly rest?

09:14.848 --> 09:15.882
There's a murderer to catch.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.451
Listen, I-i have to warn you...
We found evidence

09:18.485 --> 09:20.653
that Robyn may have
returned to a life of crime.

09:20.687 --> 09:22.722
Nonsense. That girl has a good heart.

09:22.756 --> 09:24.857
I know she was trying
to turn her life around.

09:24.892 --> 09:27.293
So let's get to work.
What can I do to help?

09:27.327 --> 09:28.489
All right.

09:28.529 --> 09:31.564
We know that Robyn was
meeting with her new crew

09:31.598 --> 09:33.199
twice a week in Spanish Harlem.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.635
And I think these symbols on her phone

09:35.669 --> 09:37.970
have something to do with her next meeting.

09:38.005 --> 09:39.492
So, what's the problem?

09:39.795 --> 09:41.651
I don't speak emoji.

09:43.075 --> 09:45.292
I think that first symbol there...

09:45.371 --> 09:47.429
The buttony thing... is a clock, obviously.

09:47.508 --> 09:49.482
Uh-huh, and the hands are on 12,

09:49.516 --> 09:51.217
so Robyn's crew is meeting at noon.

09:51.251 --> 09:53.219
Not noon... midnight.

09:53.253 --> 09:55.721
So that gives us less than an hour

09:55.756 --> 09:57.323
to figure this out and get uptown.

09:57.357 --> 10:01.327
Okay, so we have a sheep,
an ear, a "d," a bull,

10:01.361 --> 10:04.397
a bag, a beach ball, and a fish on a pole.

10:04.431 --> 10:06.999
Emojis are symbolic for other things.

10:07.034 --> 10:09.936
Clearly,
but symbolic for what other things?

10:09.970 --> 10:11.504
Well, where would you go fishing?

10:11.538 --> 10:12.271
Water.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.606
By the river.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.608
What does that have to do with sheep?

10:15.642 --> 10:19.111
Well, emojis are often compound words,

10:19.146 --> 10:22.949
so "sheep" plus "ear"...

10:22.983 --> 10:24.884
Plus "d" could mean...

10:24.918 --> 10:26.352
Sheep eared. Shepherd.

10:26.386 --> 10:28.754
- Shepherd.
- Exactly.

10:28.789 --> 10:30.790
- And the bull?
- Stubborn?

10:30.824 --> 10:32.892
Wall street? That's not in Spanish Harlem.

10:32.926 --> 10:35.695
Bull is the astrological sign for Taurus.

10:35.729 --> 10:37.363
It is. Does that help us?

10:37.397 --> 10:38.464
We'll put a pin in that.

10:38.498 --> 10:39.799
Next are the bag and the ball.

10:39.833 --> 10:42.535
Oh. And not just any bag.

10:42.569 --> 10:44.470
That is a shopping bag.

10:44.504 --> 10:46.405
An item with which you
are intimately familiar.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.807
So, shopping ball?

10:47.841 --> 10:50.576
No... mall. Shopping mall.

10:50.611 --> 10:52.011
Wait a minute.

10:53.413 --> 10:54.814
Midnight by the river

10:54.848 --> 10:57.783
at the Shepherd Taurus shopping mall?

10:58.986 --> 11:00.753
Ohhhh!

11:00.787 --> 11:02.888
Well done. Let's go.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.624
Wait, wait. Shouldn't we call the cops?

11:04.658 --> 11:06.592
Yeah,
that's a kind of dangerous neighborhood.

11:06.627 --> 11:09.061
Ladies,
with all the gentrification going on,

11:09.096 --> 11:11.130
there's no such thing as
bad riverfront property.

11:12.299 --> 11:14.433
Okay. Maybe I was wrong.

11:16.303 --> 11:18.204
Watch your step.

11:19.206 --> 11:22.074
Maybe we should be texting Espo and Ryan.

11:22.109 --> 11:24.143
I already called them.
They're on their way.

11:24.177 --> 11:26.646
I don't know whether to be happy or hurt

11:26.680 --> 11:28.614
by your lack of faith in me.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.012
Okay, I'm gonna go with happy.

11:31.051 --> 11:33.386
- Was that a rat?
- That's too big to be a rat.

11:33.505 --> 11:35.919
- Great.
- Come on.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.752
All right, that's it.

Who are you?

14:18.040 --> 14:20.074
Uh, this is Alexis, and I'm Richard Castle.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.342
We're private investigators.

14:21.377 --> 14:23.211
We're here to talk to you about Robyn.

14:23.245 --> 14:24.779
Did something happen to her?

14:24.813 --> 14:25.747
- NYPD!
- Police! Nobody move!

14:25.781 --> 14:27.815
NYPD!

14:34.623 --> 14:36.090
Yo. Castle.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.070
Where's the 911?

14:38.149 --> 14:39.027
Oh. That was...

14:39.061 --> 14:40.061
Who are all these people?

14:40.095 --> 14:41.529
Uh...

14:41.955 --> 14:43.697
Robyn's new family.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.405
I can't believe it.

14:50.439 --> 14:53.241
Robyn was the first person
to talk to me in prison.

14:53.275 --> 14:54.709
She always had my back.

14:54.743 --> 14:56.778
Is prison where all the
girls in your group met?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.973
Yeah... Through the N.B.P.

14:59.685 --> 15:01.482
Uh, No Backsliding Partnership.

15:01.517 --> 15:04.919
It's a nonprofit arts program
that helps us stay straight.

15:04.953 --> 15:06.988
We all loved singing, but Robyn was the one

15:07.022 --> 15:09.123
who put together the a cappella group.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.964
Without her, there is no Aca-Cons.

15:15.230 --> 15:18.566
Do you have any idea who
might have killed her?

15:19.115 --> 15:20.034
Agnes.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.204
She was in the cons till
about three weeks ago.

15:23.238 --> 15:24.472
And then what happened?

15:24.506 --> 15:26.173
We were auditioning for the A.A.C.,

15:26.208 --> 15:28.375
the All American A Cappella Competition.

15:28.410 --> 15:31.145
We were crushing it. No way we could miss.

15:31.179 --> 15:32.980
Unless somebody screwed up.

15:33.014 --> 15:34.048
Somebody like Agnes?

15:34.082 --> 15:38.185
Look, the Aca-Cons,
we're all onetime offenders.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.155
We work really hard to stay clean.

15:41.189 --> 15:44.058
But Agnes... She's a repeat offender,

15:44.092 --> 15:46.227
and she's not interested in changing.

15:46.261 --> 15:48.095
So rather than take a chance
before your big break...

15:48.130 --> 15:49.563
We kicked her out.

15:49.598 --> 15:53.067
We all voted,
but Robyn was the one who told her.

15:53.101 --> 15:54.869
Agnes was pissed...

15:54.903 --> 15:57.138
Accused Robyn of stabbing her in the back.

15:59.374 --> 16:01.442
Agnes Molina... Three-time loser

16:01.476 --> 16:05.079
with a long list of priors,
including B&E and assault.

16:05.113 --> 16:06.914
Looks like we can add murder to that list.

16:06.948 --> 16:07.848
Yeah, we ran her prints

16:07.883 --> 16:09.250
against the ones we found at the theater.

16:09.284 --> 16:10.151
We got a match.

16:10.185 --> 16:12.066
- And where is she now?
- She's in the wind.

16:12.132 --> 16:14.401
Agnes didn't check in with
her parole officer yesterday.

16:14.494 --> 16:15.721
Unis searched her apartment.

16:15.801 --> 16:17.067
Looks like our girl packed up and left.

16:17.146 --> 16:19.293
Well, someone's got to have
a lead on where she's hiding.

16:19.327 --> 16:20.361
Yeah, that's what we figured.

16:20.395 --> 16:22.196
Yeah,
so we asked the couple that runs the N.B.P.

16:22.230 --> 16:23.898
to come in... Scott and Linda Weinberg.

16:23.932 --> 16:25.733
Great. I'll talk to them.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.581
You guys dig into Agnes' life,
see what you can find.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.138
We started this organization
when we were both

16:31.173 --> 16:33.304
young lawyers looking to give back,

16:33.396 --> 16:36.310
and the difference we made for
these girls was so profound

16:36.344 --> 16:39.280
that we dedicated our
lives to helping them.

16:39.314 --> 16:41.916
So, how well do you know Agnes Molina?

16:41.950 --> 16:44.285
Why? Is she a suspect?

16:44.319 --> 16:46.787
Uh, yeah. She is.

16:46.821 --> 16:50.090
Captain, Agnes certainly
did some bad things in her life,

16:50.125 --> 16:52.393
but she's a sweet kid, not a killer.

16:52.427 --> 16:54.094
Do you have any idea where she is now?

16:54.129 --> 16:55.229
No.

16:55.263 --> 16:57.998
I mean, her parents shut her
out after her last arrest.

16:58.033 --> 16:59.590
And what about friends?

17:00.368 --> 17:01.635
In jail, yes.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.837
But on the outside...

17:03.872 --> 17:05.271
Just the girls in the group.

17:05.307 --> 17:06.607
There's got to be somebody else.

17:06.641 --> 17:08.409
Um...

17:08.443 --> 17:11.579
I-if Agnes was in trouble,
who would she go to?

17:12.917 --> 17:14.726
There was an ex-boyfriend.

17:14.805 --> 17:17.050
He visited her in prison once.

17:17.615 --> 17:19.791
Ex-boyfriend's name is Dexter Grimes.

17:19.858 --> 17:22.056
He's an unemployed welder and ex-con.

17:22.089 --> 17:23.523
Sounds like a real catch.

17:23.559 --> 17:24.858
And, gentlemen, as I told you,

17:24.893 --> 17:26.727
Beckett is fine with me riding along.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.296
Oh, yeah, she's fine with it.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.898
I believe her exact words were,

17:30.933 --> 17:33.367
"sure. Maybe we'll get lucky
and Castle will get shot."

17:33.402 --> 17:34.869
- Damn, bro.
- Really? Ouch.

17:34.903 --> 17:36.246
What'd you do?

17:37.130 --> 17:38.039
Nothing.

17:38.073 --> 17:41.876
You got slapped, Castle.
You definitely did something.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.077
Or someone.

17:43.111 --> 17:44.312
You cheated?

17:44.346 --> 17:45.413
What?! No!

17:45.447 --> 17:48.216
Castle, don't you lie to us.
Beckett's our family.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.584
You cheat on her, you cheat on us.

17:49.618 --> 17:50.618
What's her name?

17:50.652 --> 17:52.954
Guys,
I'm telling you the truth.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.223
Ow! That's my skin!

17:55.257 --> 17:57.758
What... is... her... name?

17:57.793 --> 17:58.826
Svetlana?

17:58.861 --> 18:00.761
- Svetlana?
- Svetlana!

18:00.796 --> 18:02.563
What, is she some kind of
Russian underwear model?

18:02.598 --> 18:03.965
Uh, yeah?

18:04.933 --> 18:06.234
What the hell are you doing?

18:06.268 --> 18:07.235
NYPD.

18:07.269 --> 18:08.102
Ayy!

18:08.136 --> 18:09.604
We're coming in.

18:09.638 --> 18:10.605
Ow.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.575
So, Dexter Grimes,

18:14.610 --> 18:16.944
when was the last time
you saw Agnes Molina?

18:16.979 --> 18:18.012
Agnes?

18:18.046 --> 18:21.115
Haven't seen her in years...
Before she got busted.

18:21.149 --> 18:23.918
Nice try, Dex.
We know that you visited her in prison.

18:23.952 --> 18:25.119
And now she's on the run.

18:25.153 --> 18:27.755
You're such a catch,
we figured she came running to you.

18:27.789 --> 18:29.423
I'm telling you... Me and her are done.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.958
I got no idea where she is.

18:30.993 --> 18:32.260
Is that right?

18:32.294 --> 18:33.995
So, then, this lipstick is from...

18:34.029 --> 18:35.429
My mom.

18:36.899 --> 18:39.600
I suppose...

18:39.635 --> 18:40.935
This is your mom's bra?

18:40.969 --> 18:42.103
Yep.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.744
Fat chance.

18:49.778 --> 18:53.648
Matter of fact, Dexter,
I believe Agnes is hiding...

18:55.217 --> 18:56.450
right here.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.756
Almost had me.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.058
Too bad I know...

19:04.092 --> 19:05.126
She's under here!

19:05.160 --> 19:07.762
Man, who piles clothes under...

19:10.586 --> 19:13.067
Getting a little nervous, Dex?

19:13.101 --> 19:15.403
Am I getting...

19:15.437 --> 19:16.615
Warmer?!

19:16.708 --> 19:17.842
Seriously?

19:22.362 --> 19:23.563
Behind the...

19:26.415 --> 19:27.415
I was right there.

19:27.449 --> 19:28.983
- Mm.
- Well...

19:32.089 --> 19:33.321
Yes.

19:33.355 --> 19:34.121
Hi.

19:36.625 --> 19:37.758
Uh...

19:37.793 --> 19:39.437
I believe this is yours.

19:44.056 --> 19:45.558
We know you were at the theater, Agnes.

19:45.657 --> 19:46.790
We found your prints.

19:46.825 --> 19:48.692
Why do you think I ran?

19:48.727 --> 19:50.394
The second I heard Robyn was dead,

19:50.428 --> 19:51.996
I knew you'd pin it on me.

19:52.062 --> 19:53.697
So you're saying that
you didn't kill Robyn?

19:53.732 --> 19:54.965
'Cause we heard you were pissed

19:55.000 --> 19:56.533
when she kicked you out of the group.

19:56.568 --> 19:57.935
Damn straight I was mad.

19:57.969 --> 20:01.221
But I walked it off,
just like my prisoner counselors taught me.

20:02.422 --> 20:04.008
Robyn called me yesterday,

20:04.042 --> 20:06.744
asked me to meet her at the
theater last night at 10:00.

20:06.778 --> 20:07.511
Why?

20:07.545 --> 20:08.846
She said she needed a bodyguard

20:08.880 --> 20:10.733
and somebody to keep her safe.

20:10.759 --> 20:13.150
A bodyguard? Agnes, come on.
You can do better than that.

20:13.184 --> 20:15.853
It's true. She offered me 500 bucks.

20:15.887 --> 20:17.654
Money trumps feelings every time.

20:17.689 --> 20:20.758
Okay. Who did she need protection from?

20:20.792 --> 20:22.026
I don't know.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.962
All she said, it was somebody
from the a cappella competition.

20:25.173 --> 20:26.830
She was gonna tell me more
when I got to the theater,

20:26.865 --> 20:29.900
but I was a couple hours late,
and she wasn't there, so I left.

20:32.534 --> 20:34.738
But I guess she was there, huh?

20:37.323 --> 20:38.742
Dead.

20:41.191 --> 20:44.048
We got witnesses that put
Agnes in a diner across town

20:44.082 --> 20:45.416
during the time Robyn was killed.

20:45.450 --> 20:46.617
Which means our killer is probably

20:46.651 --> 20:48.552
someone inside the competition.

20:48.586 --> 20:51.555
Guys, who tipped Castle off?

20:51.589 --> 20:54.124
Not us. Not after, uh...

20:54.159 --> 20:55.492
After what?

21:00.166 --> 21:01.365
Castle told us about...

21:01.399 --> 21:02.466
Svetlana.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.700
He did?

21:03.735 --> 21:06.270
He... he... told you about...

21:06.304 --> 21:07.438
Svetlana... yeah.

21:07.472 --> 21:08.572
We're so sorry, Beckett.

21:08.606 --> 21:11.275
You want we should throw
him down a flight of stairs?

21:11.309 --> 21:12.943
N-no, I'll... I'll... I'll take...

21:12.977 --> 21:14.812
Yeah, I'll handle this myself.

21:14.846 --> 21:16.780
Why don't you guys go in
and interview some people?

21:16.815 --> 21:18.515
Okay.

21:21.319 --> 21:22.386
Hey.

21:23.088 --> 21:23.787
Oh!

21:23.822 --> 21:24.588
Hey!

21:26.524 --> 21:28.792
Thanks for the call. I came as soon as I...

21:29.417 --> 21:30.498
What?

21:30.670 --> 21:32.429
Svetlana?

21:32.464 --> 21:33.564
Oh.

21:33.598 --> 21:34.565
Yeah.

21:34.599 --> 21:36.800
I, uh,
I was gonna tell you about that earlier,

21:36.835 --> 21:39.444
and I thought it would be better
if I told you in person, so...

21:40.271 --> 21:41.672
- So...?
- So, uh, the boys...

21:41.706 --> 21:44.675
They got suspicious and
accused me of cheating.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.076
I panicked, and now they think

21:46.111 --> 21:48.512
I'm dating a Russian model named Svetlana.

21:48.546 --> 21:49.746
And you couldn't think of a better name?

21:49.781 --> 21:51.014
Right?! I know!

21:51.049 --> 21:53.250
It was the only name I could come up with.
I don't know why.

21:53.284 --> 21:55.419
But still, she's a... she's a model.

21:55.453 --> 21:58.255
She's a really, really hot model.

21:58.289 --> 22:00.207
Damn straight she is.

22:08.366 --> 22:09.433
Excuse me.

22:09.467 --> 22:12.002
Hi. I'm Captain Beckett.

22:12.036 --> 22:13.804
We need to speak with whoever's in charge.

22:13.838 --> 22:14.805
Yes, that would be me.

22:14.839 --> 22:17.207
I'm Dr. Larson,
director of the A.A.C. regionals.

22:17.242 --> 22:19.877
Head judge.
I oversee all aspects of this competition.

22:19.911 --> 22:21.879
Oh,
so then you would have known Robyn King.

22:21.913 --> 22:23.347
Vaguely.

22:23.381 --> 22:26.450
She wasn't my kind of people,
if you know what I mean.

22:26.484 --> 22:29.019
You don't seem very
shaken up about her death.

22:29.053 --> 22:31.555
Well, it's horrible, of course,
but I can't say I'm surprised.

22:31.589 --> 22:33.690
She and her friends are
not exactly aca material.

22:33.725 --> 22:35.459
Because they're ex-cons, you mean?

22:35.493 --> 22:38.695
The A.A.C. is a highly respected
and civilized institution.

22:38.730 --> 22:40.130
I told the national committee

22:40.165 --> 22:42.232
it was a mistake to have
their kind involved.

22:42.267 --> 22:43.901
But did they listen? No.

22:43.935 --> 22:46.737
Dr. Larson, where were you last
night between 9:00 and 11:00?

22:46.771 --> 22:48.472
Right here.

22:48.506 --> 22:50.807
Getting the show off the
ground is a 24-hour job.

22:50.842 --> 22:53.877
Now, if you need anything else,
talk to my assistant, Troy.

22:53.912 --> 22:55.812
Please do not upset any of my performers.

22:55.847 --> 22:57.301
Thank you.

23:00.111 --> 23:01.585
This guy for real?

23:01.619 --> 23:02.519
Unfortunately, yeah.

23:02.554 --> 23:04.388
So, what do you want to do now, Captain?

23:04.422 --> 23:05.422
Let's talk to the other contestants.

23:05.456 --> 23:08.859
Ryan, you're with me.
Espo, it's you and Castle.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.763
High five.

23:12.797 --> 23:13.931

24:01.028 --> 24:03.469
This was Robyn's dressing room.

24:05.149 --> 24:06.817
When was the last time you saw her?

24:06.851 --> 24:07.985
Yesterday, right after rehearsal.

24:08.019 --> 24:09.953
Must have been about 5:30.

24:09.988 --> 24:12.489
She stormed out of here...
Practically ran me over.

24:12.523 --> 24:13.590
Was she upset?

24:13.625 --> 24:15.292
Very. But I don't know why.

24:15.326 --> 24:16.994
- Where'd she go?
- No idea.

24:17.028 --> 24:18.829
But I heard that she left the theater

24:18.863 --> 24:20.130
about a half-hour later.

24:20.164 --> 24:21.431
The assistant stage manager

24:21.466 --> 24:23.100
saw her getting in a cab out front.

24:23.134 --> 24:24.668
Okay, well, I need to talk to him,

24:24.702 --> 24:25.669
and we also need a copy

24:25.703 --> 24:27.471
of Robyn's rehearsal
schedule from yesterday.

24:27.505 --> 24:28.438
Sure.

24:28.473 --> 24:30.007
Thanks.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.608
Here we go.

24:33.778 --> 24:34.745
Beckett.

24:34.779 --> 24:35.779
Yeah?

24:35.813 --> 24:37.681
You doing okay?

24:37.715 --> 24:39.249
Uh...

24:39.284 --> 24:40.689
Yeah.

24:41.219 --> 24:44.821
You know, I was crushed when
I heard about... Svetlana.

24:47.959 --> 24:49.026
You were?

24:49.060 --> 24:50.227
Mm.

24:53.064 --> 24:54.931
Oh. Uh, well...

24:54.966 --> 24:57.200
You know, I think it's for the best.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.836
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

24:59.871 --> 25:02.673
As a matter of fact,
I'm dating someone else, too.

25:03.562 --> 25:06.843
A, uh, a Dr... Livingstone.

25:11.716 --> 25:13.317

Yeah.

- Got me right in my eye.
- I got you, too? Sorry.

25:40.111 --> 25:42.312
This made me... caught up in the moment.

25:42.347 --> 25:43.246
Castle?

25:43.281 --> 25:44.481
Is that you?

25:45.717 --> 25:46.883
Beckett?

25:46.918 --> 25:47.884
What are you doing?

25:47.919 --> 25:49.152
We're just in...

25:49.187 --> 25:50.921
What... What are you doing?

25:50.955 --> 25:53.323
We're in the middle of
Robyn's dressing room.

25:53.358 --> 25:55.359
She ran out of here at 5:30 last night.

25:55.393 --> 25:57.067
Apparently, she was very upset.

25:57.119 --> 26:00.063
Maybe over something she heard in here?

26:00.098 --> 26:02.766
Were any of you boys in
this room 5:30 last night?

26:02.800 --> 26:04.534
- Nope.
- No.

26:04.569 --> 26:06.670
- Not me.
- Unh-unh.

26:10.241 --> 26:11.942
Got a runner!

26:23.421 --> 26:25.088
Move, move, move, move! Move! Move!

26:31.462 --> 26:32.763
Don't move.

26:34.065 --> 26:34.965
Sure.

26:37.838 --> 26:39.939
This is all a big misunderstanding.

26:40.039 --> 26:41.482
Do you seriously want to play that game?

26:41.522 --> 26:43.039
Yeah, fine by us.
Put your hands on your head.

26:43.131 --> 26:44.642
W-wait.

26:44.677 --> 26:45.810
Can't we work something out?

26:45.845 --> 26:48.113
Yeah... If you tell us the truth.

26:48.147 --> 26:51.015
Now, Robyn overheard something
from your dressing room.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.402
Didn't she?

26:54.130 --> 26:56.788
I knew that my group couldn't
beat the Aca-Cons, okay?

26:56.822 --> 26:57.856
Not with their feel-good,

26:57.890 --> 27:01.259
"orange is the new singing sensation"
backstory.

27:01.293 --> 27:03.079
So I...

27:04.570 --> 27:06.197
I sort of...

27:06.232 --> 27:08.600
Did you try to fix the competition?

27:10.035 --> 27:11.169
Yeah.

27:11.203 --> 27:13.271
- I bribed Dr. Larson.
- The head judge?

27:13.305 --> 27:15.273
He was the one who was
going on and on about

27:15.307 --> 27:17.775
how the Aca-Cons shouldn't
even be in the competition,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.449
how they weren't up to
the standard of the A.A.C.

27:19.501 --> 27:20.945
And did he accept your bribe?

27:20.980 --> 27:23.848
Yeah, but Robyn overheard us,
and she burst in.

27:23.883 --> 27:25.650
She threatened to tell
the national committee.

27:25.684 --> 27:27.685
That sounds like motive for murder to me.

27:27.720 --> 27:28.953
Not for me.

27:28.988 --> 27:32.290
Dr. Larson said he'd handle it,
and then he left with Robyn.

27:32.324 --> 27:33.591
That's all I know.

27:33.626 --> 27:36.161
You better have one heck of a
good reason to drag me down here.

27:36.195 --> 27:38.062
I'm warning you... I know people.

27:38.097 --> 27:40.532
Oh. So do we.

27:40.566 --> 27:41.866
People like Hunter.

27:41.901 --> 27:43.902
You know, he told us that you took a bribe

27:43.936 --> 27:46.037
to get the Aca-Cons out of the competition.

27:47.773 --> 27:50.175
That is an outrageous lie.

27:50.209 --> 27:53.044
Now, that Hunter fellow...
I bet he's the killer.

27:53.078 --> 27:56.047
- Yes, and he is trying to manipulate you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:56.081 --> 27:57.815
Maybe he's right.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.150
Yeah, maybe.

27:59.185 --> 28:01.553
No. Wait. Couldn't be Hunter.

28:01.587 --> 28:02.754
Remember... He has an alibi.

28:02.788 --> 28:04.222
Oh, yeah.

28:04.256 --> 28:05.190
That's right. Damn it.

28:05.224 --> 28:06.724
I guess we're back to you, doc.

28:06.759 --> 28:08.159
So, what did you do... Arrange a meeting

28:08.194 --> 28:09.727
and when Robyn wouldn't cooperate with you,

28:09.762 --> 28:10.995
is that when you killed her?

28:13.032 --> 28:14.766
There was no need to kill her.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.167
We'd worked out a deal.

28:16.202 --> 28:18.703
Look, Robyn was all set to report me,

28:18.737 --> 28:21.206
but then something... peculiar happened.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.240
Peculiar?

28:22.274 --> 28:24.542
Yes, we left Hunter's dressing room,
and onstage,

28:24.577 --> 28:26.945
the crew was in the middle
of a tech rehearsal.

28:26.979 --> 28:29.948
The Aca-Con introduction
video came up on the monitors.

28:29.982 --> 28:31.349
Robyn watched it.

28:31.383 --> 28:34.219
And then, suddenly, just like that...

28:34.253 --> 28:35.520
She changed her mind.

28:35.554 --> 28:37.722
S-so you're saying

28:37.756 --> 28:40.091
that Robyn changed her
mind about ratting you out

28:40.125 --> 28:41.859
because of what she saw in some video?

28:41.894 --> 28:43.928
Like I said, it was peculiar.

28:43.963 --> 28:46.097
But Robyn promised not to say anything,

28:46.131 --> 28:47.765
so long as I rejected the bribe

28:47.800 --> 28:50.168
and gave her a copy of
that introduction video.

28:51.967 --> 28:54.906
Ironically,
I didn't find my love for singing

28:54.940 --> 28:56.070
until I went to prison.

28:56.162 --> 29:00.290
At 18, Robyn had already
been running drugs for two years.

29:00.342 --> 29:01.859
Her life was a mess.

29:01.899 --> 29:04.564
And after making a delivery
to a country-club party,

29:04.604 --> 29:06.754
she stole and crashed a car.

29:06.833 --> 29:09.472
Truth is, I was so wasted,

29:09.577 --> 29:11.357
I don't even remember what happened.

29:11.409 --> 29:13.507
Robyn was trapped in the burning car.

29:13.573 --> 29:16.238
But then, the universe sent her a hero.

29:16.304 --> 29:18.930
I was driving home, and then...

29:18.964 --> 29:20.908
Oh, my God... car crash.

29:20.948 --> 29:23.468
I pulled Robyn out,
I dragged her to safety,

29:23.520 --> 29:27.005
and then I had to tourniquet
her leg with her scarf

29:27.039 --> 29:28.268
to stop all the bleeding.

29:28.347 --> 29:31.289
And like a Phoenix rising from the ashes,

29:31.328 --> 29:35.444
Robyn emerged from this
tragedy and started a new life.

29:35.497 --> 29:38.244
That crash was the best thing
that ever happened to me,

29:38.317 --> 29:40.218
because in prison, I got clean,

29:40.252 --> 29:42.654
hooked up with the N.B.P., and...

29:42.688 --> 29:44.856
And it saved my life.

29:45.342 --> 29:49.494
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Aca-Cons.

29:49.528 --> 29:50.729
Why would Robyn be so interested in this?

29:50.763 --> 29:51.863
Hey.

29:51.897 --> 29:54.532
I managed to track down that
cab that Robyn jumped into

29:54.567 --> 29:56.234
after she got the DVD from Dr. Larson.

29:56.268 --> 29:57.035
Where'd she go?

29:57.069 --> 29:58.636
Townhouse on the Upper East Side.

29:58.671 --> 30:00.672
And look who lives there.

30:00.706 --> 30:03.541
That cannot be a coincidence.

30:06.579 --> 30:07.679
So...

30:09.248 --> 30:11.683
you saw Robyn the night
that she was murdered, huh?

30:11.717 --> 30:12.717
Yeah.

30:12.752 --> 30:15.153
It's kind of eerie,
if you think about it, huh?

30:15.187 --> 30:16.921
Yeah. I mean, why would she visit?

30:16.956 --> 30:19.057
Well, she wanted to thank me personally.

30:19.091 --> 30:21.760
You see,
Robyn was unconscious when I saved her.

30:21.794 --> 30:23.161
Then after she recovered,

30:23.195 --> 30:24.729
she went straight to prison,

30:24.764 --> 30:26.698
so we never actually properly met.

30:26.732 --> 30:29.067
Ah. Well, Percy, you are a real hero.

30:29.101 --> 30:30.568
No, you're the heroes.

30:30.603 --> 30:32.704
I was just in the right
place at the right time.

30:32.738 --> 30:35.006
Mnh-mnh. No, don't be so modest.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.208
If you didn't make a
tourniquet out of that scarf,

30:37.243 --> 30:39.577
Robyn could have bled out and died.

30:39.612 --> 30:41.679
Speaking of that scarf,
where did it come from?

30:42.615 --> 30:44.616
Um... Robyn was wearing it.

30:44.650 --> 30:45.550
She was?

30:45.584 --> 30:46.584
Mm-hmm.

30:46.619 --> 30:48.492
Oh. That's funny.

30:49.059 --> 30:50.188
Because we reached out

30:50.222 --> 30:52.390
to the hospital where Robyn was taken,

30:52.425 --> 30:53.792
and on her intake form,

30:53.826 --> 30:56.795
there's a bit of a-a fashion discrepancy.

30:56.829 --> 31:02.200
Y-you see,
Robyn's entire outfit was worth about $50.

31:02.234 --> 31:04.602
But the scarf that you used,
it was an Hermes scarf,

31:04.637 --> 31:06.404
and that was worth about 2 grand.

31:06.439 --> 31:08.973
So what I'm wondering is...

31:09.008 --> 31:11.743
Why are you lying to me?

31:15.333 --> 31:17.215
Okay.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.750
Can you keep a secret?

31:18.784 --> 31:19.951
No.

31:19.985 --> 31:22.074
But you're gonna tell me anyway.

31:24.123 --> 31:25.657
I didn't save Robyn's life.

31:26.427 --> 31:27.492
By the time I got there,

31:27.526 --> 31:29.561
she was already safe and passed out cold,

31:29.595 --> 31:32.330
and the scarf tourniquet was on her leg.

31:32.364 --> 31:33.798
Why would you lie about that?

31:33.833 --> 31:35.233
Duh!

31:35.267 --> 31:36.734
To be a hero.

31:37.659 --> 31:40.004
Do you know how many Twitter
followers I got after that?

31:40.039 --> 31:43.775
So, uh,
Robyn figured out what really happened,

31:43.809 --> 31:45.243
and that's why she came to your house?

31:45.277 --> 31:47.479
She wanted the truth, so I told her.

31:47.513 --> 31:49.080
Somebody else pulled her from the car.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.683
Then they must have... run off.

31:51.717 --> 31:53.251
That's what all this must have been about.

31:53.285 --> 31:54.652
Robyn was digging into her old arrest.

31:54.687 --> 31:56.521
Yeah,
and whatever she found got her killed.

31:58.532 --> 32:00.142
In that video, Robyn said she was so high,

32:00.168 --> 32:01.267
she didn't remember anything,

32:01.301 --> 32:04.907
so how does she know that she's
the one who stole that car?

32:05.004 --> 32:06.638
Because Percy said she was alone.

32:06.672 --> 32:08.840
But he was lying. Someone else was there.

32:08.875 --> 32:12.677
And what if that someone
was the one driving the car?

32:12.712 --> 32:15.046
Think about it...
a reason to leave the scene of an accident

32:15.081 --> 32:17.015
is that you were the one responsible.

32:17.049 --> 32:19.851
So someone else crashed the car,
pulled Robyn out,

32:19.886 --> 32:21.887
ran off, leaving Robyn to take the fall.

32:21.921 --> 32:25.390
But not before bandaging Robyn's
leg with their own scarf.

32:25.424 --> 32:27.259
So if Robyn found out who
that scarf belonged to

32:27.293 --> 32:28.260
and then confronted them...

32:28.294 --> 32:29.895
There's a good chance
that person's our killer.

32:29.929 --> 32:31.730
Hey, guys, I talked to the country club,

32:31.764 --> 32:35.000
and I think I found the
woman who threw that party.

32:35.034 --> 32:37.202
Her name is Chloe Jarvis,

32:37.236 --> 32:40.438
and apparently, she is, like,
the Paris Hilton of Long Island.

32:40.473 --> 32:42.007
You say that like it's a good thing.

32:42.041 --> 32:43.074
Yeah, but that party was years ago.

32:43.109 --> 32:45.377
How are we gonna find out
who was wearing the scarf?

32:45.411 --> 32:46.278
Photos.

32:46.312 --> 32:48.680
Because Chloe has a Snappamatic account.

32:48.714 --> 32:49.781
Smart thinking.

32:49.816 --> 32:52.117
Hopefully,
the photos of that party are still up.

32:52.952 --> 32:55.053
Damn. Chloe's account is private.

32:55.087 --> 32:57.255
And we don't have enough probable cause yet

32:57.290 --> 32:58.356
to justify a warrant.

32:58.391 --> 33:01.960
Excuse me...
the NYPD may need probable cause.

33:01.994 --> 33:03.929
Richard Castle Investigations, however...

33:03.963 --> 33:04.930
No, Castle.

33:04.964 --> 33:06.898
You cannot...

33:06.933 --> 33:08.967
hack Chloe's account on behalf of the NYPD.

33:09.001 --> 33:11.203
We absolutely forbid you.

33:11.237 --> 33:14.291
Honestly, how did you guys
ever solve murders without me?

33:16.008 --> 33:17.275
All the time.

33:22.915 --> 33:24.490
Hey, where's Castle going?

33:24.648 --> 33:25.750
S...

33:26.853 --> 33:28.220
You don't want to know.

33:28.254 --> 33:30.989
'Cause, Beckett, y-you don't need him.

33:31.023 --> 33:32.824
And... and look, just so you know,

33:32.859 --> 33:34.926
you get us in the breakup, okay?

33:34.961 --> 33:36.995
Oh, yeah. Damn straight.

33:37.029 --> 33:37.996
Anyway...

33:38.030 --> 33:40.465
Um,
I was looking over Robyn's arrest reports

33:40.499 --> 33:41.900
from the Suffolk County PD.

33:41.934 --> 33:43.602
It's pretty thin, but apparently,

33:43.636 --> 33:46.004
the evidence box in their
property room is missing,

33:46.038 --> 33:47.672
which means either they're practicing

33:47.707 --> 33:49.641
really shoddy police work...

33:49.675 --> 33:51.276
Or somebody helped our
mystery driver to frame Robyn.

33:51.310 --> 33:52.244
Exactly.

33:52.278 --> 33:54.346
The arresting officer's
name is Dan O'Grady.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.449
He just retired from the
job and moved to Manhattan.

33:57.483 --> 33:59.251
Kind of cushy for a cop on a pension, huh?

33:59.285 --> 33:59.885
It is.

33:59.919 --> 34:01.219
All right, bring him in.

34:03.856 --> 34:05.257
I don't know what to tell you, Captain.

34:05.291 --> 34:08.860
The evidence... must have been misplaced.

34:08.895 --> 34:10.996
Call the desk sergeant...

34:11.030 --> 34:12.864
No, evidence is missing...

34:12.899 --> 34:14.699
Specifically, the Hermes scarf

34:14.734 --> 34:16.467
that was sent over by the hospital.

34:16.502 --> 34:17.835
So what did you do with it?

34:19.572 --> 34:21.306
Who do you think you are, lady?

34:22.072 --> 34:23.208
I came here as a courtesy,

34:23.242 --> 34:24.842
and you're gonna accuse me of misconduct?

34:24.877 --> 34:27.344
I'm not accusing you of anything.

34:27.380 --> 34:28.847
Your own bank account is.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.483
A week after Robyn took a plea deal,

34:31.516 --> 34:36.121
you made five deposits...
$9,900 each... over five days.

34:36.155 --> 34:37.621
I don't have to listen to this.

34:37.657 --> 34:38.989
The moment you leave this office,

34:39.025 --> 34:41.025
I will be calling Internal Affairs.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.128
What do you want me to tell them?

34:43.161 --> 34:45.697
That you were helpful in
solving Robyn's homicide

34:45.731 --> 34:47.032
or that you obstructed justice?

34:47.065 --> 34:48.600
It's your call.

34:49.835 --> 34:51.503
Look.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.840
You, um...

34:56.750 --> 34:58.476
You got to understand.

34:59.879 --> 35:02.347
I was four months away
from mandatory retirement.

35:02.381 --> 35:04.916
My bank account was a joke.

35:04.951 --> 35:06.051
I was desperate.

35:06.085 --> 35:07.919
The day after Robyn was arrested,

35:07.954 --> 35:09.688
I got a phone call from some woman.

35:09.722 --> 35:11.423
- From who?
- I didn't get a name.

35:11.457 --> 35:13.058
She said she'd give me 50 Gs

35:13.092 --> 35:15.026
if I gave her all the
evidence from the case,

35:15.061 --> 35:17.095
especially, uh...

35:17.129 --> 35:19.064
That scarf.

35:23.102 --> 35:25.437
I am in... Chloe's account.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.504
Now, Alexis, do a search

35:26.539 --> 35:30.075
for Chloe's golf course
party at the country club.

35:37.049 --> 35:39.050
Oh, there's Robyn!

35:39.085 --> 35:39.851
Ohhh.

35:39.885 --> 35:43.054
She was such a lovely young woman.

35:43.089 --> 35:44.756
And she's not wearing the scarf.

35:44.790 --> 35:46.658
I don't see anyone that is.

35:53.134 --> 35:55.367
Wait... there.

35:55.401 --> 35:56.668
There's the scarf.

35:58.904 --> 36:01.106
So, the woman who changed Robyn's life

36:01.140 --> 36:03.441
is also the one who took it.

36:08.897 --> 36:10.631
Linda, how did you know Robyn?

36:10.665 --> 36:12.099
Through N.B.P.

36:12.133 --> 36:14.839
She was one of our first
prison participants.

36:15.156 --> 36:17.874
Uh, actually, you met long before that.

36:18.540 --> 36:21.713
Except Robyn was too wasted to remember.

36:23.230 --> 36:25.275
I guess we bot didn't remember.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.648
That's a wonderful scarf.

36:27.682 --> 36:28.916
Very expensive.

36:28.950 --> 36:31.619
It was very generous of you to
use it to save Robyn's life.

36:31.653 --> 36:33.621
But, then again,
it's the least you could do,

36:33.655 --> 36:36.348
considering you're the
one who crashed the car.

36:37.726 --> 36:38.792
No, I didn't.

36:40.662 --> 36:43.775
You know what? It's coming back to me now.

36:43.907 --> 36:46.809
I-I gave Robyn that scarf at the party...

36:46.941 --> 36:48.273
As a gift.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.538
Look, Linda, I get it... You were scared.

36:51.573 --> 36:53.674
If found out, you would be sent to prison,

36:53.708 --> 36:55.643
kicked out of law school.

36:55.677 --> 36:57.544
Your entire future would go up in flames.

36:57.579 --> 37:00.214
So you ran,
and you let Robyn take the fall.

37:02.017 --> 37:03.517
You can't prove any of this.

37:03.551 --> 37:05.152
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

37:05.186 --> 37:07.588
I traced the call made to Officer o'Grady.

37:07.622 --> 37:08.656
It was from your phone.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.157
I also spoke with your bank.

37:10.191 --> 37:11.859
They found the $50,000 withdrawal

37:11.893 --> 37:13.394
you used to pay him off.

37:18.767 --> 37:21.702
I-I don't know what I was thinking.

37:21.736 --> 37:23.537
I panicked.

37:24.906 --> 37:28.442
And after Robyn went to jail, I just...

37:28.476 --> 37:30.444
I felt so guilty.

37:30.478 --> 37:32.746
Is that why you started N.B.P.?

37:32.781 --> 37:35.783
I thought maybe I could help Robyn,

37:35.817 --> 37:38.452
somehow make a difference.

37:38.486 --> 37:41.088
Except she found out the truth,
confronted you,

37:41.122 --> 37:43.187
and that's why you killed her.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.292
I didn't kill Robyn.

37:45.326 --> 37:47.394
I-I didn't even know
she found out the truth.

37:47.429 --> 37:49.196
Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.

37:49.230 --> 37:50.798
I just did.

37:50.832 --> 37:52.766
I crashed the car, fled the scene,

37:52.801 --> 37:54.935
but I didn't kill Robyn.

37:54.969 --> 37:57.934
I was in Philadelphia on business
at the time of the murder.

37:57.987 --> 37:59.876
Who else knew about the crash?

38:05.847 --> 38:08.182
I'd like to speak to my lawyer now.

38:11.286 --> 38:14.588
All groups, final checks.
10 minutes until curtain.

38:18.293 --> 38:20.728
Oh, Richard,
thank you for letting me be here.

38:20.762 --> 38:22.563
Of course, mother. You should be here.

38:27.936 --> 38:29.397
Linda. Hey. It's me.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.771
The show's about to start. Where are you?

38:30.805 --> 38:32.773
Mr. Weinberg, you can hang up the phone.

38:32.807 --> 38:35.303
Your wife's being held
at the 12th precinct.

38:36.044 --> 38:38.011
Why? What the hell's going on here?

38:38.046 --> 38:39.847
We know you killed Robyn.

38:39.881 --> 38:41.982
Excuse me, but that's absurd.

38:42.016 --> 38:43.851
We canvassed around your apartment.

38:43.885 --> 38:44.918
We found one of your shirts in a dumpster

38:44.953 --> 38:46.253
with Robyn's blood on it.

38:46.287 --> 38:49.189
When she realized your
wife was behind the car accident,

38:49.224 --> 38:51.351
Robyn came looking for her, didn't she?

38:53.128 --> 38:54.495
She was pissed.

38:54.529 --> 38:55.596
And Linda was out of town,

38:55.630 --> 38:59.433
so I told Robyn I'd have
Linda meet her at her job.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.435
But you just wanted to get her
alone so you could kill her

39:01.469 --> 39:04.805
and bury your wife's secret forever.

39:04.839 --> 39:06.073
No.

39:06.107 --> 39:09.510
I wanted to make her understand
that if the truth came out,

39:09.544 --> 39:12.813
it would ruin everything...
All we had worked for.

39:12.847 --> 39:15.115
All that you girls had worked for.

39:15.150 --> 39:16.683
And that's why you killed her?

39:16.718 --> 39:18.485
No. No, no, it was an accident.

39:18.520 --> 39:21.822
She was calling me a liar and a hypocrite,
and I just...

39:21.856 --> 39:23.824
I pushed her, and suddenly,
she hit her head off...

39:26.027 --> 39:27.661
Scott Weinberg, you're under arrest

39:27.695 --> 39:30.217
for the murder of Robyn King.

39:33.868 --> 39:35.803
Final rehearsal.

39:35.837 --> 39:37.437
Aca-Cons, you're up next.

39:38.873 --> 39:40.407
Oh.

39:40.441 --> 39:43.010
Oh, are you... Are you Robyn's girls?

39:43.044 --> 39:45.312
Oh, listen, I'm an acquaintance of hers.

39:45.346 --> 39:46.747
My name is Martha Rogers.

39:46.781 --> 39:48.715
I only have one real specialty...
performance.

39:48.750 --> 39:51.685
But if I can assist you
in any way at all...

39:51.719 --> 39:53.420
- Absolutely. That would be great.
- Yes? Okay.

39:53.454 --> 39:54.822
Darling, could you hold that for me?

39:54.856 --> 39:56.423
You gonna work your magic, mother?

39:56.457 --> 39:59.026
You bet your best-selling novels I am,
kiddo.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.161
All right, now I want you to listen to me.

40:01.196 --> 40:04.431
I know how hard this is. All right?

40:04.465 --> 40:06.500
But you can do this.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.937
You can rise above your
sorrow and win this for Robyn.

40:09.971 --> 40:11.071
Yes?

40:11.105 --> 40:12.673
- Yes.
- Let's go.

40:12.707 --> 40:14.842
I want you to go up there,
take a deep breath...

40:24.285 --> 40:27.387
Guys, I really appreciate you
letting me help out on this one.

40:27.422 --> 40:29.256
Well, you know...

40:29.290 --> 40:30.891
We'd do anything for Martha.

40:30.925 --> 40:32.459
Yeah. We still like her.

40:32.493 --> 40:33.727
Ow!

40:33.761 --> 40:36.063
W... are you saying that because
Beckett and I are separated

40:36.097 --> 40:37.598
that we can't be friends?

40:37.632 --> 40:39.766
Look...

40:39.801 --> 40:42.703
At first,
we thought it was just a temporary thing,

40:42.737 --> 40:44.938
but...
Now we know you're dating other people.

40:44.973 --> 40:45.973
Oh! That reminds me.

40:46.007 --> 40:47.908
Got to get ready for my
hot date with Svetlana.

40:47.942 --> 40:49.943
Have fun with that paperwork.

40:56.117 --> 40:56.817
What?

40:56.851 --> 40:57.751
Hey...

40:57.785 --> 41:00.988
If you need to vent, we're here for you.

41:01.022 --> 41:04.124
Yeah. We can...
we can talk all night if you need to.

41:05.093 --> 41:06.894
Yeah. Uh, you know what?

41:06.928 --> 41:09.429
Um, thanks, guys, but I've got

41:09.464 --> 41:11.932
a really hot date with that doctor.

41:13.001 --> 41:14.201
- Livingstone?
- Yeah.

41:18.673 --> 41:20.507
Is it just me, or is this just...

41:20.541 --> 41:23.143
Wrong... All kind of wrong.

41:25.513 --> 41:27.014
Who is it?

41:27.048 --> 41:30.117
Svetlana...
Your sexy Russian lover.

41:31.119 --> 41:32.853
Correction... My sexy Russian lover

41:32.887 --> 41:34.955
who happens to be a model.

41:34.989 --> 41:36.356
Oh.

41:36.391 --> 41:38.225
Get the...

41:39.027 --> 41:41.028
Ah.

41:41.062 --> 41:42.629
Dr. Livingstone, I presume?

41:42.664 --> 41:44.731
Couldn't find my pith helmet, so...

41:47.335 --> 41:48.068
Come.
