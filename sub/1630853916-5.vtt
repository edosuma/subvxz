00:17.000 --> 00:18.250
Gina.

00:18.833 --> 00:23.041
Gina, listen to me.
You have to get away from her.

00:24.375 --> 00:27.791
No matter what she says, don't listen.

00:28.750 --> 00:31.041
Just go.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.333
-We're going together.
-Promise me.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.416
Get away!

00:38.333 --> 00:41.583
-Stop! Dylan! Dylan, stop!

00:49.541 --> 00:51.750
<i>You know what Leni</i>
<i>wanted you to know.</i>

00:52.250 --> 00:53.625
<i>You don't know the truth.</i>

00:54.291 --> 00:57.125
<i>All right, Gina.</i>
<i>Tell me your truth.</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:04.458
<i>My mother was the only person</i>
<i>who could ever tell us apart.</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:09.541
<i>But when our mother died,</i>
<i>something changed in Leni.</i>

01:10.541 --> 01:11.666
<i>Leni closed up.</i>

01:12.541 --> 01:15.541
<i>Here's the thing. I never saw her cry.</i>

01:16.375 --> 01:17.750
<i>Not at the funeral.</i>

01:17.833 --> 01:21.708
<i>Not in the days and weeks that followed.</i>
<i>Not ever.</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:25.375
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>we were closer than ever.</i>

01:26.250 --> 01:28.000
<i>And we learned that together…</i>

01:28.083 --> 01:29.083
Leni!

01:29.833 --> 01:32.791
Yes? What do you want, Claudia?

01:36.125 --> 01:37.208
<i>…we had power.</i>

01:39.375 --> 01:41.000
<i>And when real trouble happened…</i>

01:43.416 --> 01:45.250
<i>The switch could save us.</i>

01:46.666 --> 01:47.916
<i>Or, so Leni said.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:51.041
Gina, your sister, Claudia,
has been very badly hurt.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.250
Just tell me the truth.

01:53.333 --> 01:57.125
<i>That's how I got blamed</i>
<i>even though I didn't do it.</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:09.458
<i>We started the switching for real</i>
<i>when we were teenagers.</i>

02:10.041 --> 02:11.958
<i>I was going through my punk phase</i>

02:12.041 --> 02:14.958
<i>and Leni was going through</i>
<i>her awkward phase.</i>

02:15.500 --> 02:18.000
<i>We switched all the time at school.</i>

02:18.083 --> 02:20.458
<i>Sometimes, just to trade dance partners.</i>

02:21.833 --> 02:24.333
<i>Leni and I shared everything.</i>

02:25.958 --> 02:28.291
<i>We even shared Jack.</i>

02:32.750 --> 02:33.833
Gina!

02:33.916 --> 02:37.291
Here. I got you there.
Let me help you. You okay?

02:37.375 --> 02:39.125
Yeah.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.875
Sure nothing hurts?

02:41.958 --> 02:42.875
You all right?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.291
She's fine.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.958
It'll toughen her up a bit.

02:57.708 --> 02:58.625
It's my turn.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.958
Okay. Help you up?

03:04.541 --> 03:06.291
-Feel all right?
-Mm-hmm.

03:14.416 --> 03:18.125
<i>Jack, Leni and I</i>
<i>were a tight threesome.</i>

03:21.875 --> 03:23.291
<i>Until we weren't.</i>

03:54.625 --> 03:56.291
<i>I needed someone of my own.</i>

04:09.875 --> 04:10.708
<i>I needed…</i>

04:12.958 --> 04:13.791
<i>my own life.</i>

04:19.375 --> 04:21.250
-Is that good, Jack?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.333
-Yeah. Sounds good.
-Cool.

04:23.416 --> 04:24.916
There's that boy again.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.541
You mean your
fifth period history class, G?

04:28.375 --> 04:29.875
I'm gonna go play that song again.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.375
Your sister seems uptight.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.166
She's cool if you get to know her.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.541
How about I get to know you instead?

04:50.083 --> 04:51.875
That's kind of the same thing.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.500
-Jesus. No, it's not.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.125
You're nothing like her.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.416
-Yeah.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.041
<i>That summer and fall, I…</i>

05:55.208 --> 05:57.000
<i>I remember every day.</i>

06:00.250 --> 06:01.791
<i>Every walk.</i>

06:05.750 --> 06:07.958
<i>Every curve of every road.</i>

06:11.916 --> 06:14.791
<i>Like I remember</i>
<i>the night at the Halloween party.</i>

06:18.458 --> 06:19.291
All right.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.500
What was that?

07:10.625 --> 07:11.500
I don't know.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.583
There's somebody in here.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.000
There's no one here.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.000
-Want me to check?
-Please?

07:26.375 --> 07:28.458
Fire! Shit! There's a fire!

07:29.666 --> 07:31.708
-Go! I'll get him! Go!
-No!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.541
Gina! What's going on?

07:36.625 --> 07:39.291
He's still inside.
Dylan! We have to help him!

07:41.416 --> 07:43.708
We'll meet up later. Let's go!

07:45.125 --> 07:48.416
<i>A man died, Gina. And Dylan ran.</i>

07:49.333 --> 07:51.291
<i>How's that going to look to the police?</i>

07:51.791 --> 07:53.958
<i>They're investigating him</i>
<i>for murder, Gina.</i>

07:56.000 --> 07:58.750
I mean, I was with him.
He couldn't have done it.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.500
You were with him the whole time?

08:02.208 --> 08:03.875
If he didn't do it, why'd he run?

08:05.291 --> 08:06.708
Why'd he leave town?

08:07.208 --> 08:08.166
I don't know.

08:08.916 --> 08:12.041
I mean… It must have…
It must have been an accident.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.583
Accident or not, a man died, Gina.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.041
But I love him.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.583
<i>The next morning you were gone.</i>

08:21.666 --> 08:22.875
<i>I thought you had run.</i>

08:23.541 --> 08:25.125
<i>I didn't know the truth.</i>

08:25.208 --> 08:27.416
<i>I didn't know what Leni had done.</i>

08:28.916 --> 08:33.041
<i>So I was alone again.</i>
<i>And Leni and Jack only got closer.</i>

08:36.541 --> 08:39.125
<i>And watching Leni marry Jack…</i>

08:43.375 --> 08:46.333
<i>felt like the end of us, her and me.</i>

08:46.958 --> 08:48.333
<i>Leni had Jack forever</i>

08:48.416 --> 08:50.958
<i>and I had to figure out</i>
<i>how to be on my own.</i>

08:51.833 --> 08:54.000
<i>I got a scholarship to UCLA.</i>

08:54.083 --> 08:56.208
<i>The other side of the country. I took it.</i>

08:56.916 --> 08:59.333
<i>No one in Los Angeles knew I was Bad Gina.</i>

08:59.916 --> 09:01.250
<i>I was free at last.</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:04.625
<i>I didn't realize I'd feel so disconnected.</i>

09:05.250 --> 09:06.958
<i>I started losing control.</i>

09:07.541 --> 09:10.083
<i>I had a breakdown</i>
<i>the fall of my sophomore year.</i>

09:11.291 --> 09:15.666
<i>UCLA student services referred me</i>
<i>to a doctor who did pro bono.</i>

09:15.750 --> 09:20.125
Gina, you've talked about
being her copy, her mirror, her equal.

09:20.916 --> 09:24.708
But now you are being reborn as just you.

09:25.958 --> 09:29.416
<i>Charlie helped me find me.</i>

09:30.833 --> 09:34.041
<i>Once I started telling my story,</i>
<i>it kept rolling.</i>

09:34.583 --> 09:37.625
<i>My senior thesis in creative writing</i>
<i>got published</i>

09:37.708 --> 09:39.875
<i>and well, you know. You read it.</i>

09:43.500 --> 09:47.000
<i>People loved the story</i>
<i>of two tragic twin sisters.</i>

09:47.583 --> 09:51.000
<i>And Charlie was so proud of me.</i>

09:51.791 --> 09:52.666
I did it.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.625
This is amazing.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.666
You were so instrumental
in getting me here.

09:58.708 --> 10:00.791
I am so impressed. Truly.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.041
We should celebrate.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.958
Let me take you to dinner, please.

10:05.666 --> 10:09.458
<i>He loved me</i>
<i>for all I was and all I wasn't.</i>

10:10.875 --> 10:13.041
<i>So Leni and I were both happily married</i>

10:13.125 --> 10:16.000
<i>and we both got pregnant at the same time.</i>

10:16.083 --> 10:19.333
<i>And for some reason</i>
<i>I thought that would be a good thing.</i>

10:19.916 --> 10:22.833
G, we get to be together.

10:22.916 --> 10:25.041
We get to raise the girls together.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.916
One in Mount Echo and one in LA.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.916
What? What do you mean?

10:31.875 --> 10:35.333
Wait, do you plan on staying there?
You can write from anywhere, G.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.333
I like my life in LA.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.833
And Charlie says
I need appropriate boundaries.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.958
Charlie doesn't know you like I do.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.541
He doesn't know the things that I know.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.625
You need special attention.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.750
I'm not that person anymore, Leni.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.250
-I'm stronger than you think.
-Okay.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.000
Well, I will be here when you need me.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.750
<i>I lost the baby.</i>

11:11.666 --> 11:13.791
<i>Dr. Martin pediatrics.</i>

11:13.875 --> 11:17.583
<i>After the miscarriage,</i>
<i>Leni was there for me.</i>

11:21.250 --> 11:22.833
I don't know what happened.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.750
We're gonna get
through this together.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.333
Power of two.

11:28.750 --> 11:29.916
<i>I needed her.</i>

11:49.375 --> 11:50.458
<i>Coming home…</i>

11:53.208 --> 11:54.208
<i>hurt.</i>

11:54.875 --> 11:58.333
Hey, good to see you.
Come on in, please.

11:58.916 --> 12:01.875
It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.333
Yeah. Well, it's only for a couple days.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.041
Here she is.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.083
Mattie.

12:21.583 --> 12:26.000
<i>Being in Mount Echo gave me</i>
<i>an opportunity to reconnect with Leni.</i>

12:26.083 --> 12:28.458
<i>I didn't know what was going on with her.</i>

12:29.708 --> 12:30.541
Got it.

12:37.541 --> 12:39.500
Leni! Oh, my God.

12:41.166 --> 12:45.083
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.125
Oh, my God.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.333
What is wrong with you?
You don't walk away from a baby like that.

12:50.416 --> 12:51.750
It was just a few seconds.

12:51.833 --> 12:52.791
Leni.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.291
Sometimes I wish…
I just wish she would die.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.666
You need help. All right? A nanny.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.958
We can't afford that.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.000
Charlie and I will pay for it.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.833
Jack would never accept that.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.166
You need to do something.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.416
She almost drowned.

13:15.541 --> 13:16.375
It was…

13:20.708 --> 13:22.916
I'm fine. We're fine.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.625
She never would've drowned.

13:30.666 --> 13:33.125
I think that
you have postpartum depression.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.375
Maybe I was never meant to be a mother.

13:37.958 --> 13:39.000
Don't say that.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.875
Of course you were meant to be a mother.

13:49.541 --> 13:50.625
And so are you.

13:56.541 --> 13:57.458
Leni.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.458
I'll be you for a while.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.458
Go back to LA.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.541
You stay here with Jack and Mattie.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.875
-We can't do that.
-Of course we can.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.916
We always have. Huh?

14:19.208 --> 14:20.916
We're one, you and me.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.083
And she's ours.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.875
<i>I stayed a few more weeks</i>
<i>to help Leni.</i>

14:34.000 --> 14:36.416
<i>At least that's what it was at first.</i>

14:37.125 --> 14:40.791
<i>No one thought anything of it</i>
<i>when we went together for makeovers.</i>

14:41.333 --> 14:43.625
<i>Same hair? It's a twin thing.</i>

14:46.666 --> 14:48.375
<i>Mattie took her first step.</i>

14:49.583 --> 14:52.625
<i>"Leni" and Jack celebrated.</i>

14:56.416 --> 15:01.541
<i>"Gina" suddenly grew to love</i>
<i>readings and Q and A's and all that shit.</i>

15:05.375 --> 15:11.625
<i>And Mattie grew. And Jack</i>
<i>was the perfect father and husband.</i>

15:11.708 --> 15:15.333
<i>Charlie was always incredible,</i>

15:15.416 --> 15:19.875
<i>brilliant, loving, accepting, sane.</i>

15:21.250 --> 15:24.541
<i>We switched every year on our birthday.</i>

15:24.625 --> 15:26.708
<i>Left the men for a girls day,</i>

15:26.791 --> 15:30.666
<i>went to the salon,</i>
<i>inspected our bodies for any new freckles.</i>

15:31.458 --> 15:32.791
<i>It became a ritual.</i>

15:32.875 --> 15:35.625
<i>Like the rites of a church</i>
<i>that you forgot you had founded.</i>

15:35.708 --> 15:38.208
…that it won't be long
before she's riding into the woods

15:38.291 --> 15:39.333
like we used to do.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.416
Yeah.

15:41.500 --> 15:46.708
She loved kindergarten this year,
but she's looking forward to first grade.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.208
You're sad to be going back to LA.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.458
I'm confused.

15:53.916 --> 15:55.791
I feel like I'm betraying everyone I love.

15:55.875 --> 15:57.375
Or saving them.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.875
I mean, we saved a life.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.458
We probably saved two marriages.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.833
But what are we doing now?

16:07.916 --> 16:10.750
We are living two incredible lives.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.000
Will we ever tell Mattie?

16:14.125 --> 16:15.458
Why would we do that?

16:15.541 --> 16:18.500
G, this is working for us. This is us.

16:19.291 --> 16:23.333
You have an amazing year ahead
of you in LA. I've got it all teed up.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.208
Go put your Gina clothes on.
The guys are waiting for us.

16:31.583 --> 16:32.458
I am Gina.

16:33.416 --> 16:34.708
This year you are.

16:48.666 --> 16:53.000
<i>But Leni grew</i>
<i>more controlling of both lives.</i>

16:53.083 --> 16:56.458
I won't hide the ball here, Gina.
We loved the new proposal.

16:56.541 --> 17:01.291
It was stunning,
incisive, brave, of course.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.708
That's fantastic.

17:02.791 --> 17:06.250
To tell the story
of your miscarriage and your healing…

17:06.333 --> 17:08.750
It's a story women need to hear.

17:09.333 --> 17:13.416
We're planning
a big initial run of 250,000 copies.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.375
Possibly three.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.583
Now, the last thing I'm going to do is…

17:16.666 --> 17:18.208
<i>Leni, what the fuck?</i>

17:19.041 --> 17:20.083
<i>You have no right.</i>

17:20.875 --> 17:22.541
You do press, you do photoshoots,

17:22.625 --> 17:26.333
you take marketing meetings,
but you do not pitch story.

17:27.833 --> 17:28.916
Especially that one.

18:37.625 --> 18:38.666
See you next week.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.041
Hello.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.375
<i>Why've you been at that building</i>
<i>every Thursday afternoon for months,</i>

18:49.458 --> 18:51.083
<i>without mentioning in the diary?</i>

18:51.166 --> 18:52.375
What building?

18:52.458 --> 18:56.083
<i>The building you're standing in front of,</i>
<i>Gina. What are you doing there?</i>

18:56.750 --> 18:57.708
Yoga class.

18:57.791 --> 19:02.208
<i>I know you're lying because I just called</i>
<i>and canceled all your future appointments.</i>

19:02.291 --> 19:03.708
What the fuck, Leni?

19:03.791 --> 19:06.541
<i>You don't need a psychiatrist, Gina.</i>
<i>You have me.</i>

19:33.666 --> 19:34.666
What's the matter?

19:38.333 --> 19:39.625
I can't, um…

19:42.833 --> 19:44.291
I can't do this again.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.875
I can't do it anymore.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.166
Can't do what?

19:56.291 --> 19:57.958
Hey, breathe.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.541
It's too much.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.125
Is this about the book?

20:06.583 --> 20:09.083
You don't want to tell that story, do you?

20:09.916 --> 20:12.416
That story is yours. No one else's.

20:15.208 --> 20:16.166
It's a lot.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.291
So don't write it.

20:22.125 --> 20:23.250
Yeah, they, um…

20:25.166 --> 20:26.333
They're counting on me.

20:27.291 --> 20:29.291
No. No, they don't matter.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.333
All that matters is that you are happy.

20:31.416 --> 20:33.916
You. Whatever that means.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.791
I'm such a fucking mess.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.000
I'm sorry.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.875
Don't apologize.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.666
It's okay to be messy.
Be very fucking messy.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.958
I would never judge you.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.416
<i>I started to make plans.</i>

21:23.000 --> 21:24.458
<i>I needed money.</i>

21:24.541 --> 21:26.875
<i>Cash that Charlie wouldn't know</i>
<i>was missing.</i>

22:52.125 --> 22:55.208
Our marriage… Us.

22:56.083 --> 22:56.916
Do you…

22:59.083 --> 22:59.916
love me?

23:01.875 --> 23:05.291
Or did you just, uh, find me
fascinating once upon a time?

23:06.250 --> 23:07.125
Um…

23:08.583 --> 23:09.458
Can't it be both?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
No. I don't think so.

23:20.458 --> 23:24.125
I am deeply, deeply, obsessed with you.

23:25.541 --> 23:28.583
And, yes, fascinated still.

23:29.208 --> 23:34.666
And I will always love you as you are.
As you come to me. Always.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.458
Gina, come away from the window.

23:57.541 --> 24:00.375
Hey, we better get this done
before the guys get back.

24:10.125 --> 24:11.625
-More wine?
-Yeah.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.666
Gina, you seem calm.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.333
Is that bad?

24:24.416 --> 24:28.083
No, it's good.
Yeah, it's been a tough year.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.458
I haven't always known
what's been going on with you.

24:31.416 --> 24:33.166
Despite your best efforts?

24:34.583 --> 24:36.666
What's that supposed to mean?

24:38.875 --> 24:41.166
Nothing. I'm good.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.083
I had a breakthrough actually.
On the book.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.833
Thank God.

24:50.333 --> 24:53.291
If I had to spend
another year pretending to write…

24:55.666 --> 24:56.541
I love you.

25:00.875 --> 25:02.125
You know that, right?

25:03.916 --> 25:07.166
I've always loved you. And I always will.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.250
You sure you're all right?

25:15.333 --> 25:17.000
I'm good.

25:18.416 --> 25:22.083
Yeah, I'm looking forward to, uh,
my year at Mount Echo.

25:23.333 --> 25:24.250
Going home.

25:25.916 --> 25:26.875
Good.

25:37.125 --> 25:40.833
They are so little
to have such big personalities.

25:40.916 --> 25:44.541
Oh, I know, right?
It's like they're born fully formed.

25:46.500 --> 25:51.250
Hey, do you think that they, um,
do diving lessons for adults here?

25:51.333 --> 25:53.458
We're going diving on our next vacation.

25:53.541 --> 25:56.208
You should talk to my cousin.
He's a coach here.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.208
Your cousin?

25:57.708 --> 25:58.875
You might remember him.

25:59.416 --> 26:01.625
He and Gina were close, back when.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.583
You're all right.
Want to grab a towel

26:05.666 --> 26:08.250
that will cover you? You good?
Yeah, all right.

26:09.833 --> 26:12.916
Keep that flow.
We're looking for elegance over speed.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.875
You don't need to have
your hands coming out of the water.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.083
Good flow, guys. There you go.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.250
Dylan James.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.000
You look good.

26:33.791 --> 26:36.208
I'll see you tomorrow. Be on time.

26:36.291 --> 26:38.916
You gotta have respect in all things.
Get some sleep.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.291
-See you.
-Good stuff.

26:41.958 --> 26:43.083
Good stuff.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.875
Hey. Dylan.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.416
Leni.

26:48.791 --> 26:50.791
-Long time.
-Yeah, good to see you.

26:51.791 --> 26:52.625
You look good.

26:53.541 --> 26:55.416
-How's Gina?
-She's in LA.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.375
Yeah, she's, um, a writer now.

26:59.083 --> 27:00.333
I know. I read her book.

27:01.291 --> 27:03.041
-You did?
-Of course.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.125
Wow. Um…

27:05.166 --> 27:06.166
Yeah, um…

27:07.833 --> 27:08.833
How are you?

27:09.333 --> 27:11.208
What have you… What have you been up to?

27:11.291 --> 27:15.208
Not much. You know, I was…
I was away for a while, but I'm back now.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.333
Putting my life together.
Staying with my grandma.

27:18.416 --> 27:19.625
-Georgia.
-Yeah.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.125
How is she?

27:23.416 --> 27:25.041
You know, I got to get going.

27:25.541 --> 27:26.833
Say hi to Gina for me.

27:26.916 --> 27:33.125
Wait. Do you, uh, happen to offer
diving lessons here for adults?

27:33.833 --> 27:35.375
I'm interested in free diving.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.166
Um, no. Not here.

27:38.958 --> 27:42.166
-That's something that we do on the coast.
-But you free dive?

27:42.250 --> 27:44.833
Yeah. I'm certified and everything.

27:44.916 --> 27:46.583
Well, maybe you could teach me.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.041
Privately.

27:56.916 --> 28:00.708
Hey, I got to get to Campbell's place.
One of his mares is foaling.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.750
I'm taking Mattie to her swim lesson.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.291
Dinner will be a little late.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.541
I said I can teach Mattie to swim.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.750
Jack, you don't have the time.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.583
Look, uh, the new foal, uh,

28:12.375 --> 28:14.000
I didn't see any paperwork.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.041
Yeah, they're paying cash.

28:18.416 --> 28:20.958
There should still be paperwork.
Unless, um…

28:28.916 --> 28:30.208
We need the money.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.625
All right? The new assessment,
the tax has doubled. You know that.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.000
It's this or sell land.

28:36.083 --> 28:37.625
Look, Charlie and Gina--

28:37.708 --> 28:41.208
Don't talk to me about Charlie.
I don't need his money.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.166
You'd rather lose the land?

28:43.250 --> 28:44.958
I'm not gonna lose the land, Len.

28:45.541 --> 28:47.958
I'll do whatever it takes. I will.

28:49.291 --> 28:50.625
Look, this is our home.

28:51.416 --> 28:54.250
Yours, mine, Mattie's.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.875
Our home could be 40 acres smaller.

28:56.958 --> 28:59.375
No. We're protecting this property.

28:59.458 --> 29:02.083
Charlie's got plenty of money.
He's got family money.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.750
Yeah, I know.
For all his fancy luxury trips.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.083
Which cost us plenty.

29:06.166 --> 29:09.125
Paying for dinners
and all kinds of expensive shit,

29:09.208 --> 29:12.458
just to keep up with your
pretentious sister and her rich husband?

29:12.541 --> 29:13.708
It's too much.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.458
I didn't know you felt that way.

29:16.541 --> 29:18.458
You know what, you can go jet setting.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.291
I'm not doing it anymore.

29:20.875 --> 29:22.750
I'll stay here and I'll run our farm.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.333
That's enough for me.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.208
It's enough for me too, Jack. Always.

29:29.208 --> 29:31.375
Lately it doesn't feel that way.

29:38.750 --> 29:41.041
-How long?
-Ninety-three seconds.

29:41.125 --> 29:42.333
-What?
-Yeah.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.125
-That's good.
-Yeah.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.125
I've been practicing.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.375
It's impressive.

29:59.458 --> 30:03.958
Let me tell you, that water
in Lake Tahoe is so much colder.

30:04.583 --> 30:06.041
Maybe we should try it in the ocean.

30:06.791 --> 30:08.000
It's about a half day away.

30:11.041 --> 30:12.208
I can get away if you can.

30:22.083 --> 30:23.291
All right. Another round?

30:23.875 --> 30:24.833
Uh…

30:25.541 --> 30:27.625
Yeah, thanks.

30:28.291 --> 30:29.833
Bold.

30:32.916 --> 30:34.208
What are you doing, Leni?

30:34.291 --> 30:36.750
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.500
-Having a drink.
-Mmm.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.958
With an old friend.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.833
Since when are we friends?

30:45.541 --> 30:46.750
We could be though.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.333
Look, I don't…

30:52.250 --> 30:54.666
I don't want to
disappoint anyone in my life

30:54.750 --> 30:56.083
or hurt anyone, but, um…

30:59.125 --> 31:01.666
Look, I'm not in the right place. So…

31:04.833 --> 31:06.791
Then where are you?

31:06.875 --> 31:10.458
Trapped by my own bad choices.

31:12.375 --> 31:13.333
Okay.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.041
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

31:23.583 --> 31:24.583
Do you know what I mean?

31:25.791 --> 31:28.666
I specialize in making bad choices.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.750
I'm trying to break that habit.

31:31.833 --> 31:32.708
Yeah.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.791
I'm sorry. This is…

31:37.083 --> 31:39.833
This isn't fun, you know. Um…

31:39.916 --> 31:40.916
It's all right.

31:43.333 --> 31:46.208
You know, it's real.
It's better to be real.

31:47.333 --> 31:48.166
Is it?

31:49.583 --> 31:50.666
Always.

32:02.333 --> 32:03.291
I can't do this.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.958
We got… Just too much history.

32:08.041 --> 32:10.708
When you destroyed
my relationship with Gina,

32:10.791 --> 32:12.416
you knew exactly what you were doing.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.375
What? The morning after the fire?

32:19.333 --> 32:21.833
-That was a terrible day--
-Bullshit!

32:22.833 --> 32:25.875
I left to protect Gina, like you said.

32:27.291 --> 32:28.791
You came to me,

32:28.875 --> 32:31.583
said the cops thought
it was me and Gina

32:31.666 --> 32:34.375
<i>and that I needed to leave town</i>
<i>to deflect attention.</i>

32:35.416 --> 32:39.666
And time went by.
And my life just went to shit.

32:39.750 --> 32:45.833
And it occurred to me that
maybe you were jealous of what we had.

32:45.916 --> 32:47.708
Maybe you just wanted me gone.

32:48.416 --> 32:49.250
No.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.583
But looking at you now. Seeing you.

32:56.041 --> 32:58.541
It's just… It's too complicated.

32:59.541 --> 33:00.416
I'm sorry.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.208
Dylan!

33:12.166 --> 33:13.333
Wait, please.

33:14.708 --> 33:18.708
You remember when we were 16,
when we first kissed?

33:18.791 --> 33:20.166
No, we never kissed.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.458
Dylan, I'm not Leni.

33:23.583 --> 33:24.458
I'm Gina.

33:27.791 --> 33:29.541
Shut the fuck up.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.166
Now, this is low even for you.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.666
There was a hawk circling above

33:32.750 --> 33:36.250
and we both said that we wanted
to be like the hawk. Flying free.

33:36.333 --> 33:37.291
And the sun was setting

33:37.375 --> 33:39.750
and I said that
I had to get back and you asked…

33:41.541 --> 33:44.583
If… If it'd be okay if I kissed you.

33:44.666 --> 33:46.625
You were so sweet to ask me.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.875
No. That's not you. That was Gina.

33:48.958 --> 33:52.166
No. There was a tiny drop of water
at the tip of my nose

33:52.250 --> 33:55.041
and you wiped it before you leaned in.

33:55.125 --> 33:58.000
And I never forgot it.

33:59.666 --> 34:01.416
Gina could have told you all that.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.208
-Gina?
-Yeah.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.666
You know what Leni wanted you to know.

34:28.416 --> 34:30.208
You don't know the truth.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.833
All right, Gina.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.708
Tell me your truth.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.333
Thank you.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.666
Oh. What is that?

35:17.250 --> 35:21.500
Did you know that the Victorians had
a whole thing about flowers?

35:21.583 --> 35:23.666
And that every flower has a meaning?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.125
I heard that.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.291
This one…

35:27.208 --> 35:30.166
This one means true love.

35:32.541 --> 35:33.541
I'll take it.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.750
Do you think it's finished?

35:37.833 --> 35:39.500
Princess Mattie and her rocket ship.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.833
Here, let me fix your crown.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.416
-Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Go get the basket of scarfs.

35:44.916 --> 35:45.916
Look at that.

35:46.458 --> 35:49.000
Thank you so much for looking after her.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.375
I really appreciate it.

35:50.458 --> 35:53.041
-So you're off to your diving lesson?
-I am.

35:54.041 --> 35:55.708
Why are you all dolled up?

35:55.791 --> 35:59.458
Those lessons have been going on
for weeks now. What's gotten into you?

35:59.541 --> 36:01.125
Uh…

36:01.625 --> 36:04.333
You know,
maybe you should be joining a dating app.

36:04.416 --> 36:05.583
What's a dating app?

36:06.666 --> 36:08.875
Talk to your Auntie Claudia about that.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.291
Night, sweetie.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.416
Bye, Mommy.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.208
Lindy's so excited
to be the first baby on Jupiter.

36:15.416 --> 36:16.583
Come with me.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.958
Yeah? To where?

36:21.250 --> 36:22.791
I have a town picked out.

36:25.791 --> 36:28.416
I have a connection in LA
who can get us birth certificates,

36:28.500 --> 36:31.208
passports, everything that we could need.

36:31.875 --> 36:34.916
I'm still trying to get
my life back together.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.375
-Here?
-Yeah.

36:39.083 --> 36:44.166
Is this really where you want to end up
after everything they did to you?

36:51.625 --> 36:52.791
Let's be new.

37:09.791 --> 37:10.708
Here you go.

37:19.458 --> 37:21.583
Did I get the wrong order?
Let me take it back.

37:21.666 --> 37:22.791
It's not the coffee.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.083
I can't believe you would do this.

37:27.833 --> 37:30.833
-We are friends, Leni. Best friends.
-What?

37:31.625 --> 37:32.833
Stay away from Dylan.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.458
Not your business.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.333
He is my cousin. I care about him.

37:49.041 --> 37:51.833
I watched your family
run him off once, Leni.

37:51.916 --> 37:52.916
After the fire.

37:53.458 --> 37:56.000
You are not going to do it again.
I won't let you.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.416
No one is running anyone off, Meg.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.041
All right? The past is the past.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.833
All right? We're adults now.

38:02.916 --> 38:06.916
We're getting a second chance
of getting to know each other.

38:11.875 --> 38:16.916
You know what it's like to find the person
that you're supposed to be with.

38:20.375 --> 38:23.083
You and Liss. I'm happy for you.

38:26.125 --> 38:30.458
But Track and Jerry,
they have no idea, do they?

38:32.166 --> 38:33.083
You wouldn't.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.083
Try me.

38:36.208 --> 38:37.250
I love him.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.916
And I need it to be kept a secret.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.500
It's positive.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.916
Well. Well…

39:05.291 --> 39:06.541
Okay.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.000
Are you sure it's not Jack's?

39:12.083 --> 39:14.083
No. We haven't had sex in weeks.

39:19.708 --> 39:21.208
Well, what do you want to do?

39:23.083 --> 39:24.125
What do you want to do?

39:24.208 --> 39:26.166
I want you to have a choice in this.

39:29.208 --> 39:32.125
So much of what's happened to you and me,

39:32.208 --> 39:33.666
we haven't had a say in it.

39:35.916 --> 39:38.625
I want you to have the final say in this.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.291
I love you.

39:47.291 --> 39:49.375
Once upon a time I dreamed…

39:51.375 --> 39:53.125
of running away with you.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.833
Starting a life together. A family.

39:57.958 --> 39:59.250
That was my dream.

40:03.916 --> 40:05.666
That was my dream too.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.875
What… What about Mattie and Jack?

40:22.291 --> 40:23.500
I ruined that.

40:24.500 --> 40:28.625
I love them, but lies aren't the answer,
no matter how long I've been living them.

40:30.458 --> 40:31.291
Okay.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.333
We can't wait until the birthday trip.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.833
We're gonna have to go soon.
Before I start showing.

40:45.916 --> 40:47.166
We'll need money.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.750
Can you get any from LA?

40:50.833 --> 40:54.666
No. Charlie's in control
of all the accounts.

40:54.750 --> 40:58.000
The kind of guy who oversees everything.
Every cent. He'll know.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.208
What about the book money?

41:00.291 --> 41:02.250
It was a best-seller, right?

41:02.333 --> 41:05.208
It was a literary best-seller.
That money's long gone now.

41:14.458 --> 41:15.666
But I have an idea.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.958
A way to get money right now.

41:49.375 --> 41:50.250
Zelda!

41:53.125 --> 41:54.083
Sorry, kiddo.

41:58.416 --> 42:00.250
It never should have come to this.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.083
Gina?

42:57.958 --> 42:59.041
I need some help.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.458
Oh, my goodness.

43:08.166 --> 43:09.375
You're okay.

43:09.458 --> 43:11.458
I was lost out there for so long.

43:11.541 --> 43:13.000
It's okay.

43:13.083 --> 43:14.958
I didn't even know if you were alive.

43:19.208 --> 43:22.000
-I had to shoot Zelda. She ran off.
-It's okay.

43:22.958 --> 43:26.250
It's okay. As long as you're okay.

43:30.125 --> 43:33.000
Hey, baby's okay. All right?

43:35.250 --> 43:38.166
I got to the cabin as soon
as I could. I saw you with Leni.

43:38.250 --> 43:40.333
Yeah. I took her there
to see what she knew.

43:40.416 --> 43:42.916
Yeah, but she stole
the passports and the tickets.

43:43.583 --> 43:46.958
Shit! Shit.

43:48.916 --> 43:50.375
I shouldn't have looked away.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.250
I'm sorry.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.000
What are we gonna do?

43:58.083 --> 43:59.791
Get out of town and never look back.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.750
I'm gonna go to that party.
Say my goodbyes.

44:04.791 --> 44:05.625
Okay?

44:11.791 --> 44:13.291
That cake was beautiful.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.458
Yeah, it was.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.708
Look at the moon. How pretty is that?

44:24.750 --> 44:25.791
I don't want to.

44:27.125 --> 44:28.708
I'm cross with Mrs. Moon.

44:29.291 --> 44:34.958
When Mommy was missing,
Mrs. Moon didn't tell me she was okay.

44:39.333 --> 44:41.833
Well, that all worked out.

44:41.916 --> 44:43.208
Didn't it? She was fine.

44:46.166 --> 44:49.333
Mrs. Moon is lovely,
but you don't really need her, do you?

44:50.291 --> 44:53.750
I mean, even people you love
who aren't by your side,

44:55.250 --> 44:56.541
they live in your heart.

44:57.791 --> 44:58.875
Like you and me.

45:00.541 --> 45:02.583
When I'm far, far away from you,

45:03.791 --> 45:06.916
I keep you right here.

45:09.916 --> 45:13.416
So will you keep me right here?

45:15.208 --> 45:17.000
Yeah? Okay.

45:31.750 --> 45:34.291
Gina? What are you doing here?

45:34.375 --> 45:35.958
We made a plan to meet here.

45:37.083 --> 45:39.791
-Where's Dylan?
-But you called and changed the plan.

45:39.875 --> 45:41.791
You're supposed to be at the cabin.

45:43.708 --> 45:46.333
No, it's Leni. Jesus.

45:53.750 --> 45:54.666
Dylan?

45:58.750 --> 46:00.875
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

46:02.208 --> 46:03.833
Baby. It's okay.

46:03.916 --> 46:06.500
-We're gonna go to the hospital. Come on.

46:06.583 --> 46:08.000
It's all right. I got you.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.750
-Gina.

46:15.833 --> 46:17.583
Gina, listen to me.

46:17.666 --> 46:22.791
You have to get away from her.
No matter what she says,

46:22.875 --> 46:24.750
don't listen.

46:25.458 --> 46:28.041
-Just go.
-No.

46:28.125 --> 46:30.333
-We're going together.
-Promise me.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.875
You and our baby, get away!

46:37.791 --> 46:40.166
Don't!
We're almost at the hospital.

46:40.250 --> 46:42.291
It hurts like hell, babe.

46:42.375 --> 46:43.291
Oh, God!

46:43.375 --> 46:44.916
No, no, no. Baby!

46:45.708 --> 46:46.958
Dylan! Dylan, stop!

46:47.041 --> 46:49.291
We're almost there, baby. Hold on.

46:50.416 --> 46:51.500
-Dylan, stop!

46:55.916 --> 46:57.166
No.

47:02.458 --> 47:03.750
No!

47:09.791 --> 47:11.541
-Fuck!

47:38.541 --> 47:40.791
Goodbye, my love.
