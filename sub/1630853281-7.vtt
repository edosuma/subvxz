WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
You bought Dumbo?
How are we supposed to pay for this?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
US licence deal.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.640
I told you, there's no more rubber.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.840
I'll double the wholesale price.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.440
Where are you getting this money
from?

00:08.440 --> 00:09.920
I really need that dough, Newbie.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
We're on it.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.480
I already told you that, Trotter.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.560
Buddy!

00:13.560 --> 00:14.680
(LAUGHS) Mac!

00:14.680 --> 00:15.960
Shirley, this is Mac.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.120
Mac, the legendary S Kwong.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.160
China white.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.520
I wanna make you a partner.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.880
My name on the board?

00:24.880 --> 00:25.960
No.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.920
While you're in my shop,
they're Bare Feet boards.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.560
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.840
Argh!

00:30.840 --> 00:32.040
Get off!

00:33.320 --> 00:34.880
(SCREAMS) No!

00:36.440 --> 00:38.920
You ever wonder
if it could've worked between us,

00:38.920 --> 00:40.640
what it would've been like?

02:24.680 --> 02:26.240
(INAUDIBLE)

03:05.160 --> 03:06.880
(CAR DOOR SQUEAKS AND CLOSES)

03:15.480 --> 03:16.640
Trace?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.240
I locked it.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.440
Ah, what? Why?

03:19.440 --> 03:21.960
I saw you with Margaux, Trot,
so you know why.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.480
Ah, let me in, Trace.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.680
Please, Tracy.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.760
Tracy, please?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.760
Isn't this too big
to take into a bank?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.120
Hey?

03:46.120 --> 03:47.440
No, this one's just for show.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.120
We'll give out the real one
next year,

03:49.120 --> 03:52.800
when we actually hold the comp,
yeah?

03:52.800 --> 03:56.600
Yeah, but, Snap, what's gonna stop
someone just stealing this one

03:56.600 --> 03:58.680
and then cashing it in?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.560
It's like real money.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.600
Look at the date, Choc.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.480
It's for next year.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.040
Oh, yeah.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.280
Put it down. Put it down!

04:09.400 --> 04:12.120
Arthur Foreman.
Hey!

04:12.120 --> 04:14.960
Ah, mate, thank you so much
for coming all this way.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.400
Yeah, no.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.200
Brian,
it's great to finally meet you.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.720
Hey, ah, just call me Snapper,
mate. Everyone does.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.800
Snapper?
Uh-huh.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.560
Snapper. That's great.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.200
Who's this?
Yeah, I'm Choc.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.000
Choc. Snapper and Choc.
Hey.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.240
(LAUGHS)

04:28.240 --> 04:30.560
Uh-oh, I see you've already gone
to the liberty of, ah,

04:30.560 --> 04:31.720
of spending my money.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.160
No, I just wanted you to see
what it would look like, you know?

04:34.160 --> 04:35.200
Righto.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.920
We can always discuss the amount,
of course.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.040
No, it all looks, ah, tickety-boo.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.840
Been looking forward
to this weekend for months.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.840
Yeah.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.000
Shall we, ah...?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.760
Please.
Yeah.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.600
Come on, Brian. (LAUGHS)

04:47.960 --> 04:50.000
Yeah, I had a nickname at school.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
Foreskin?
Don't.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.720
No.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.720
No, no, they, ah...
they tried that one.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.760
No. No, I was, ah, the Dodger.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.200
Arthur.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.400
Arty.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.480
Artful.

05:03.560 --> 05:04.560
Dodger.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.360
You don't know Oliver Twist?

05:07.440 --> 05:08.440
Oh, ye...

05:08.440 --> 05:09.800
Oh, hey, so, ah, listen,

05:09.800 --> 05:11.960
I wanted to do this thing
with the competition next year.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.480
I wanted to do this thing
with the heats.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.080
I wanna call it 'Man on Man', hey?

05:17.080 --> 05:19.280
Well, no,
maybe we call it 'Foreman on Man'.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.160
(LAUGHS)
Right. Because...

05:22.160 --> 05:24.040
Right? (LAUGHS)

05:24.040 --> 05:25.200
Yeah. We'll think about it.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.640
Hey, do you think I could present
that big cheque of yours

05:27.640 --> 05:28.960
to the winner?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.680
Wait, so you're in?

05:30.680 --> 05:33.760
Mate, I wouldn't come all this way
if I wasn't gonna sponsor your comp.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.600
Great! (LAUGHS)

05:35.600 --> 05:37.920
Yeah, of course you can. Yeah.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.840
And you do all your manufacturing
here?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.040
Yeah. Yeah.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.360
We're, ah, actually about to start
a new line of boardshorts.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.520
I've been designing them myself.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.080
Give them that, ah,
Bare Feet vibe, you know?

05:49.080 --> 05:52.160
I hear there's a small issue
with your wetsuit rubber supplier,

05:52.160 --> 05:53.760
bit of competition
from down the road?

05:55.280 --> 05:57.000
You're well-informed.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.320
Never spend money unless
you've done your research, Snap.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.600
It's impressive.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.280
Yeah, well, we've been watching
you fellas for a while.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.400
LightWave have secured that US deal.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.280
Must make you a bit worried?

06:08.280 --> 06:09.320
No.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.680
Best way to lose control
of the, ah, product.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.240
Exactly.
Yeah.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.960
Yeah. Yeah.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.920
The original and the best,
am I right?

06:16.920 --> 06:18.080
Hey!

06:18.080 --> 06:21.280
Staying salty since 1969, ugh!

06:21.280 --> 06:22.800
(LAUGHS)

06:22.800 --> 06:24.800
I love that. I love that.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.040
(SIGHS CONTENTEDLY)

06:26.040 --> 06:28.400
You're buying this place?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.160
I'm thinking about it.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.800
What does Sharpie think?

06:31.800 --> 06:34.120
I haven't told him yet.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.680
I'm the first?

06:35.680 --> 06:36.880
We're partners.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.080
We're building something together.
(LAUGHS)

06:41.520 --> 06:43.080
What?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.360
You're officially
part of the family.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.360
For now.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.760
Oh, no, admit it -
we've gotten under your skin.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.880
We have weaselled our way
into your heart.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.520
No. I just like the view, OK?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.360
Nah, you're gonna start surfing,
you'll lose the accent.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.720
You're gonna be a real local now.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.920
Well, whatever happens,
you will never see me in corduroy.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.360
Oh, but I look so good.
(LAUGHS)

07:07.920 --> 07:11.160
I heard you stole
all of Snapper's rubber.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.600
Didn't steal it.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.680
Bought it.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.520
Moneybags, eh?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.480
Can I borrow this, Reggie?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.000
What's wrong with your board?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.280
Nice chatting with you too, mate.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.720
MAN: (ON RADIO) It's 6:11.
11 minutes after 6am.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.720
Today, tonight and tomorrow
will be hazy and hot and humid,

08:02.720 --> 08:04.320
with a high today of...

08:45.440 --> 08:46.880
Hey, babe.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.960
Bud, we need to talk.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.560
Everything OK?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.320
It's just that...

08:59.400 --> 09:01.440
..I'm starting
to get some really good roles.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.920
And my agent has some really
important people for me to meet.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.680
And things are just starting
to take off for you.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.520
This is all good.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.000
And now I'm getting fat.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.640
Fat?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.000
What?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.400
No, you're not.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.640
I will though, Bud.

09:26.840 --> 09:31.840
I went to the doctor
and...I'm having a baby.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.400
(LAUGHS)

09:39.400 --> 09:41.640
Hey, this is amazing!

09:41.640 --> 09:42.640
Wha...

09:43.720 --> 09:44.960
Really?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.320
You want it?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.840
Your baby?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.320
Are you...you kidding?

09:49.320 --> 09:50.640
(LAUGHS)

09:50.640 --> 09:51.840
Our baby.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.480
This is just what we need.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.880
I'm in.

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
You're in?

09:56.880 --> 09:59.000
I'm in. Of course. I'm in.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.040
He knows! (LAUGHS)

10:06.080 --> 10:07.320
Yeah!

10:07.320 --> 10:09.800
Well, I'm not sure
who's gonna father who here,

10:09.800 --> 10:12.120
but I can guarantee

10:12.120 --> 10:16.160
this is going to be the best dressed
baby in all of California.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.120
I'm so excited for you guys.
Thank you.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.760
I'm proud of you.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.000
Hey, why don't you girls go,
ah, whip us up some champagne?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.240
(CONTINUE CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

10:30.480 --> 10:31.760
(CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS)

10:37.840 --> 10:39.400
Aah!

10:40.520 --> 10:42.000
Did you get the cash?

10:45.040 --> 10:46.560
It's coming.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.760
Man, I cannot wait
to get Trotter off our backs,

10:51.760 --> 10:53.960
just be free to do our own thing,
you know?

10:53.960 --> 10:55.360
Yeah.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
Hey.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.040
This is good news, right?

11:02.040 --> 11:03.760
The best.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.760
Champagne.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.080
Neat.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.120
You have to let me
give you a baby shower...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.400
Oh, come on, let her do it...

12:13.640 --> 12:15.240
Where is he now?

12:16.480 --> 12:17.560
I don't care.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.600
Can't believe
you're being so calm about this.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.360
I feel like this huge weight's
been lifted from my shoulders,

12:23.360 --> 12:24.360
to be honest.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.240
I always knew there was
something between them,

12:27.240 --> 12:29.760
but I was always made to feel
like an idiot for even thinking it.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.040
It's Friday night.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.720
Let's go to Snap's place.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.240
I don't think that's a good idea.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.880
You're always going to his parties
and I'm never allowed to go.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.400
Because he's your enemy.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.680
He's Trot's enemy.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.000
(GROANS)
Yes! (GIGGLES)

13:02.080 --> 13:04.520
(LIVELY CHATTER)

13:09.520 --> 13:11.400
I wanna introduce you to somebody.
Come.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.160
Apparently, he's loaded.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.640
He can invest in my film?

13:14.640 --> 13:16.960
Maybe let him invest
in Snapper's comp first.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.880
We don't all have an inheritance.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.360
You guys want more drinks?

13:20.360 --> 13:25.320
Jeez, I would love
a business like this.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.520
Honestly, mate,
I am constantly chasing cashflow.

13:28.520 --> 13:32.320
I mean, turnover's good,
don't get me wrong, but, ah,

13:32.320 --> 13:34.680
I just never actually
feel like I have any money.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.040
(LAUGHS)

13:36.040 --> 13:37.680
Maybe I could help with that, huh?

13:37.680 --> 13:39.600
I mean, you don't have to give me
an answer right now,

13:39.600 --> 13:41.840
but while I'm here I do want to talk
to you about a bigger investment

13:41.840 --> 13:43.240
than just a sponsorship.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
Like what?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
Like what?

13:45.240 --> 13:46.960
How about like giving you
some proper capital

13:46.960 --> 13:49.120
so you can run your business the way
you want and not have to worry?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.720
You want to wait
until you see the price, right?

13:52.720 --> 13:53.840
Fair enough.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.560
Shall we start
with this announcement?

13:56.760 --> 13:58.480
The Foreman...
Oh, yeah.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.080
Yeah? Yeah?
That's right. Yeah.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.360
OK.
OK.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.880
Um, hey. Alright, everybody!

14:05.880 --> 14:07.280
Gather round.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.520
Minute of your time.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.760
Ah, this is just a quick word

14:11.760 --> 14:14.480
to announce
that Foreman Sporting Goods

14:14.480 --> 14:20.880
is now the official sponsor
of next year's Bare Feet Classic!

14:20.880 --> 14:22.240
(CHEERING)

14:22.240 --> 14:24.680
You can see the prize money
right there.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.800
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the man himself,

14:27.800 --> 14:31.800
Mr Arthur Dodger Foreman!

14:31.800 --> 14:33.480
(CHEERING)
Come on, let's hear it for him.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.560
Hey, ladies, he's single.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
I'm not single.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.240
Well, you say that now.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.120
I, for one, am bloody thrilled

14:40.120 --> 14:45.360
that next year we will be able
to offer some real prize money.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.200
The times are finally changing,
folks.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.840
You got a woman's comp yet, Snap?

14:48.840 --> 14:51.600
You get me a cheque, Dani,
and I will get you a competition.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.160
Now, everyone, make sure you show
Dodger Foreman here a good time

14:56.160 --> 14:57.840
as you are getting pissed today,

14:57.840 --> 15:01.600
because he is paying for everything!

15:03.440 --> 15:05.400
Bear, come take care of this man.
Yeah.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.080
Have a good time.
Enjoy.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.480
Hey, Dim, how come
you never grew your hair out?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.120
Why do you care?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.480
Honestly, I don't.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.640
Just bored with working here
every night

15:19.640 --> 15:21.360
and not getting anything
back from you.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.120
I talk.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.080
No, mate, you mope.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.560
You mop and you mope.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.200
Maybe I've got a lot on my mind.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.080
You don't think
I've got a few problems, Dim?

15:35.760 --> 15:36.760
Finally.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.400
Breakthrough.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.200
No bloody way.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.400
What's this?

15:53.400 --> 15:56.160
I just wanna make sure
you don't burst into flames

15:56.160 --> 15:57.800
as you cross the threshold.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.160
(LAUGHS)

15:59.160 --> 16:00.840
Easy.
I'm OK.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.240
Oh, look at that, you're fine.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.520
I am so not fine, Snap.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.880
Hi, Margaux.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.520
Hi.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.840
Nice trip to Sydney?

16:26.840 --> 16:30.280
Ah, it was a work trip,
so it was quite productive.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.640
Hmm.

16:31.640 --> 16:36.200
Is that how you'd also describe
spending the night with my husband?

16:39.160 --> 16:40.520
Oh.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.040
Tracy, I'm...

16:45.080 --> 16:46.240
How long?

16:47.800 --> 16:50.280
How long has it been going on, huh?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.680
Months?

16:51.680 --> 16:52.960
Or years?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.320
It's not what you think.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.240
I saw you.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.360
I know what it was.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.560
Margaux.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.760
Is this true?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.880
It was just one night.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.120
Run, Sharpie.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.200
Don't look back.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.240
Tracy, I'm sorry.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.080
Apology not accepted.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.320
What are you looking at?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.240
Like you didn't already know!

17:36.240 --> 17:37.800
Trace.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.000
You all knew what happened in Bali

17:40.000 --> 17:42.120
and none of you
cared enough to tell me.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.120
How long have you all been
laughing behind my back, huh?

17:45.120 --> 17:47.040
Keeping Trot's secret safe?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.240
No, we didn't know about this.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.560
Why did you all choose him
and not me?

17:56.440 --> 17:57.800
To be fair...

17:59.640 --> 18:03.160
..you did take my money
and start a rival business with it.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.880
Right where you're standing,
if I recall.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.080

I do.

Don't.

I gave him everything and he just
threw it straight back in my face.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.960

ah,

24:50.040 --> 24:51.840
we can do a lot more deals like that.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.360
It's yours?

We're paying it off this week, yeah.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.480
So, Cee Cee, I hear that
you've organised some publicity.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.680
Ah, yes. A friend of a friend
works for West Coast Business News.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.600
It's a really great place
to launch the business.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.840
We also have a, ah, new campaign.

don't keep it too much of a secret.

last night.

How was it?

Yeah, it was OK.

Did you find your dad?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.800
Ah, yeah. Yeah, I did.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.480
And?

27:16.480 --> 27:18.320
Um, it was... it was good.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.760
Sorry, you must be jetlagged.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.600
No, actually, I...I...

27:25.960 --> 27:27.480
I came back through Bali.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.640
Oh, were you working in Bali?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.440
I'm so jealous. You are so lucky.

27:37.720 --> 27:41.480
Um, you should come see my new shop,
Dani's Surf Shack.

to speak to Trotter.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.120
What are you doing here?

28:17.880 --> 28:20.520
Why would you send me to Bali
when you knew what was gonna happen?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.120
What are you talking about?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.160
Hey. Hey.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.160
Shirley?

28:28.160 --> 28:30.240
Shirley, what's all this?

28:30.240 --> 28:32.320
Shirley?

28:33.360 --> 28:34.720
Don't.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.840
Did you know about the drugs?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.800
What? No.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
What about the kid?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.840
What kid, Shirley?

28:47.840 --> 28:49.800
The kid
that no-one gives a shit about

28:49.800 --> 28:51.560
because he's Asian and a nobody.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.200
OK, I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.960

28:57.440 --> 28:58.600
And Mac.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.480
Mac?

29:05.440 --> 29:09.440
Mac did a drug deal in Bali
and it went wrong.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.480
Trot, Mac killed someone,
a young boy.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.920
He just shot him right there
in the chest in front of us.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.280
And then Buddy just paddled it out
and just...

29:26.280 --> 29:28.000
..and just left him to the sharks.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.760
Yeah, so you all can just sit here
and get rich

29:31.760 --> 29:34.120
and wait while your American profits
start rolling in,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.280
because
no-one's going to say anything.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.240
No, Shirley. Shirley, I swear.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.360
I swear,
I didn't know anything about this.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.920
Don't worry.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.920
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.800
Your precious little company is safe,

29:49.800 --> 29:51.960
but this is on you.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.480
You want a beer?

29:59.480 --> 30:01.400
Beer? Um, no, thank you.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.440
Hmm.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.600
Alright.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.520
What the f...?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.800
(GRUNTS)

30:11.800 --> 30:13.520
Choc!

30:13.520 --> 30:14.640
Ch...

30:16.120 --> 30:17.720
Get my fridge open.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.080
Can't, Snap, that's superglue.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.320
What the hell is superglue?

30:21.320 --> 30:22.720
You're not getting any more beer

30:22.720 --> 30:24.520
until you promise
you're not selling out.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.520

30:31.800 --> 30:33.080
How does he even know?

30:33.080 --> 30:35.880
Well, I did have a few of those
funny cigarettes last night,

30:35.880 --> 30:37.400
who knows what I said?

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440

huh?

30:41.440 --> 30:42.800
Yeah, go on.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.440
You know, I love the set-up,

30:47.440 --> 30:50.600
but you must get swamped
when a big order comes in.

30:50.600 --> 30:54.200
Ah, yeah, well, no, I was gonna
take on a few more locals,

30:54.200 --> 30:57.240
once, ah, production of the
boardshorts got, ah...got going.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.480
Yeah.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.200
Yeah. Well, we've been looking into
offshore manufacturing.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.200
You know, Hong Kong, Penang.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.320
You can increase production
and your profit margin.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.520
What about the quality?

31:06.520 --> 31:08.040
Yeah.
Yeah, it's obviously important.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.040
Samples I've seen,
it's totally fine.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.440
I'm telling you,
offshore production's the future.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.080
The sooner you offload
this Australian payroll,

31:15.080 --> 31:16.640
the sooner
you start to see a profit.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.480
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh, jeez.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.560
Hey, Reg. (LAUGHS)

31:22.560 --> 31:25.200
How about you give a man
some warning next time?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.480
(LAUGHS)

31:26.480 --> 31:28.400
Can you hear yourself?

31:28.400 --> 31:31.520
OK, mate, why don't we give the, ah,
Dodger here a little bit of space.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.560
Hey.
Come on.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.400
Morning.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.440
So that's it?

31:35.440 --> 31:37.640
You're just gonna let them sell
and take everything offshore?

31:37.640 --> 31:39.760
Does that include me?
We're just talking, right?

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
Oh.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.240
That's how it starts, Snap.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.720
I'm allowed to explore my options,
aren't I, mate?

31:47.720 --> 31:49.800
I mean, Jesus, Reg, look at me.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.080
I live in a barn.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.400
Yeah, and I live on your couch,
Snap.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.600
We could do better.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.800
By selling out?

31:59.280 --> 32:02.280
Or being able to get back into
the water every once in a while,

32:02.280 --> 32:04.120
instead of fighting with Trotter
every day.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.800
Oh...
Huh?

32:05.800 --> 32:08.920
Or, I dunno, mate, maybe by being
able to focus on the surf comp.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.640
Don't you think it's time surfers
actually started making some money?

32:11.640 --> 32:14.840
You never used to care about
the money, Snap!

32:14.840 --> 32:18.560
I make a payroll every week,
that's it!

32:18.560 --> 32:21.840
And I am supporting
half of this town, including you,

32:21.840 --> 32:23.920
and what do I have to show for it,
huh?

32:26.160 --> 32:27.160
Oh.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.160
Fucker!

32:39.000 --> 32:40.480
Hey, Reg.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.120
You gonna show me a board?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.320
Samples are up there, Choc.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.160
Just put your name down.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.120
Not a Bare Feet board.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.840
I want one like Dimma's.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.680
Mine's a special commission.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.920
So do me one.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.360
I've been savin'.

32:53.360 --> 32:54.920
Or I could work here for you
and pay it off.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.640
How are you gonna work here
if I work here?

32:56.640 --> 32:59.560
No-one is working here!

33:01.640 --> 33:03.680
Now go on, rack off!

33:03.680 --> 33:04.920
Both of you.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.520
You know,
you should have your own place, Reg.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.320
Jesus, Dim,
just give it a rest, mate!

33:30.480 --> 33:32.240
We have to talk, Trace.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.320
OK.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.760
Let's hear it.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.000
I fucked up.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.520
Yeah, you did.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.200
Look, I didn't plan to see her,
but it happened.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.160
So you cheated on me by accident?

33:44.160 --> 33:45.440
It's not like that.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.880
Don't act like you didn't have
a choice, Trot.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.960
Look, I know this doesn't make it
any easier to hear, but what you saw

33:52.960 --> 33:56.000
was us drawing a line under
everything and saying goodbye.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.040
Goodbye?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.640
You live in the same town, Trot.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.720
What did you think that you would do?

34:04.720 --> 34:07.960
See Sharpie at the pub
and have a drink with him?

34:07.960 --> 34:10.400
Or have them over for dinner?

34:10.400 --> 34:13.560
Watch me
try and be friendly with her?

34:13.560 --> 34:17.360
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.760
Well, clearly
you weren't thinking about me.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.360
What do you need me to...

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
..to do, Tracy?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.600
What do you need me to do
to make this up to you?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.440
I'll do anything.
I'll do everything.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.000
I don't think you can.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.520
It's too late, Trot.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.360
Why her?

34:43.840 --> 34:45.960
What does she have that I don't?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.960
Give me another chance, Trace.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.560
Just go.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.040
Please.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.080
What did you think
when you were fucking my girlfriend?

35:41.520 --> 35:43.120
That it didn't matter
about anyone else?

35:43.120 --> 35:44.840
We'd had a lot to drink.
It was a one-off thing.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.960
Yeah, yeah. Shut up.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.480
Mate...
I don't wanna know.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.400
Here's the thing, Trot,
we're not mates.

35:53.560 --> 35:57.520
Yeah, definitely not now,
but I don't think we ever were.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.480
You took the best thing I ever had

36:05.480 --> 36:07.200
and you pissed it against the wall.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.520
You're right.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.160
Pissed everything
up against the wall.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.000
You just want everything, don't ya?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.840
Yeah, that's me.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.280
Arsehole.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.800
Take a swing.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.840
What did you say?

36:17.840 --> 36:20.400
Take a swing, Sharpie. Go on,
I'm an arsehole. I deserve it.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.640
Punch me.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.960
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.480
Well, maybe if you weren't
such a boring dickhead,

36:31.480 --> 36:32.560
she wouldn't have done it.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.160
MAN: Oi, stop it, both of you.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.440
MAN: Break it up, break it up!

36:38.440 --> 36:41.400
Actually,
that does feel kinda better.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.320
Are you alright?

36:46.320 --> 36:47.680
Yeah.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.960
Do you mind
if I start with some photos?

37:09.960 --> 37:11.120
Yeah, sure.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.080
Great.
Hey, try that.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.080
Hmm.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.760
(GIGGLES)

37:18.760 --> 37:21.040
I gotta say, this looks like
the perfect party house.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.080
Yeah. We've had a few.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
I bet.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.560
So is that the lifestyle
that you're trying to sell?

37:27.560 --> 37:29.640
(CAMERA CLICKS)

37:30.680 --> 37:35.000
We make shorts for surfers,
designed by surfers.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.800
You know what,
why don't we move you to the couch?

37:39.960 --> 37:41.760
We're at the beach, right?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.040
So...

37:43.040 --> 37:44.400
Yep.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.520
Put your feet up.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.120
Why don't you tell me
how it all started?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.160
That's Bud.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.760
Buddy Fraser, right there.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.120
He's my business partner.

38:03.120 --> 38:08.200
We did a surf trip to Bali
back in '71...

38:08.200 --> 38:09.400
Oh, yeah.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.160
And we were surfing

38:11.160 --> 38:17.280
and we noticed that everyone's trunks
were simply not up to the task.

38:17.280 --> 38:21.880
So I came up with this idea
of lightweight trunks

38:21.880 --> 38:26.200
with, you know, fairly bold designs
to stand out in the market.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.560
A piece of paradise
that you could hold in your hands.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.760
Or buy at the mall?

38:34.040 --> 38:36.360
Or go surfing in.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.320
I didn't know
they had surf in Missouri.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.800
(LAUGHS)

38:39.800 --> 38:41.440
Well, we can all dream.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.960
(CAMERA CLICKS)

38:58.440 --> 39:00.080
Would you excuse me for a moment?

39:00.080 --> 39:03.000
I'll show you some of the trunks.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.080
You created LightWave?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.040
I'm selling a story.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.120
Trotter's story.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.160
Well, what does it matter?
Trotter made up half of it, anyway.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.640
We were all in Bali together.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.120
Who even is that guy?

39:17.120 --> 39:20.360
Look, I'm doing an interview
for West Coast Business News.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.360
Why?

39:22.360 --> 39:26.680
If we're gonna grow, we need to
look like a serious business, Bud.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.080
What are you talking about?

39:28.080 --> 39:30.520
Wetsuits, boardshorts,
T-shirts, sponsorships,

39:30.520 --> 39:32.040
let's scale this right up.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.440
This is just the beginning.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.920
All we have to do is stay clear-eyed

39:36.920 --> 39:39.320
and you and I
are sitting on a goldmine.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.800
Clear-eyed?

39:44.920 --> 39:47.120
What, you're telling me
you're not high right now?

39:47.120 --> 39:48.120
Come on.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.840
Here's the cash
for Trotter's licence fee.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.560
Do you want me to tell your little
reporter friend how I got that?

39:59.960 --> 40:03.920
Hey, anything you need to know
about the business, this guy,

40:03.920 --> 40:06.040
this guy right here, he's your man.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.400
Alright?

40:10.920 --> 40:12.920
Ah, trouble in paradise?

40:12.920 --> 40:14.120
Oh, no, it's all good.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.200
All good.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.680
Shall we continue?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.040
Sure.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.320
(SIGHS)

40:19.320 --> 40:21.160
Why don't you pass me those?
Yeah.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.280
Ahem.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.320
There's something I wanna say.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.400
OK.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.440
Feels like every time I meet a guy,

40:45.440 --> 40:48.600
I jump into bed with him
and then he breaks my heart.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.040
Well, that's no good.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.120
No, it's not.

40:52.120 --> 40:56.200
So I made a rule that I wasn't
gonna do one-night stands anymore.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.240
You know, we were really,
really drunk.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.080
You don't have to feel bad about it.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.600
Oh, I don't regret rooting you.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.600
No, I've been reading this book
by Erica Jong, The Fear of Flying.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.440
There's this thing
that the woman does in the story,

41:10.440 --> 41:11.960
it's called a zipless...

41:16.120 --> 41:17.400
A zipless fuck.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.840
Is that, like,
sex with the clothes on or...?

41:21.840 --> 41:27.560
No. It's sorta like
sex without power or commitment.

41:27.560 --> 41:31.200
No-one asks any questions or wants
anything other than just sex.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.960
I wanna give it a try.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.400
With me?

41:34.400 --> 41:35.720
Of course with you.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.160
You in?

41:39.440 --> 41:40.600
Yeah.

41:43.120 --> 41:44.520
Glad we sorted that.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.520
What are you doing?

42:00.520 --> 42:04.240
It's a, ah, drumroll for when
you open that up and read the price.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.480
Right.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.000
And I get to keep 49%, yeah?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.400
Oh, well, for now.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.040
I'm joking.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.000
Right.
(LAUGHS)

42:19.360 --> 42:20.600
And Reggie's safe?

42:20.600 --> 42:23.000
Yeah, of course.
He's making me a board to take home.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.600
And no offshore manufacturing, we
keep all the locals on staff, yeah?

42:26.600 --> 42:28.040
Snapper, would you open it up?

42:28.040 --> 42:30.080
I wanna see the look on your face.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.640
Yeah.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.280
And I still get to run
the Bare Feet Classic?

42:42.280 --> 42:44.280
Ah, the Foreman Classic.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
What?

42:46.360 --> 42:47.800
Well, you can keep the name
for next year,

42:47.800 --> 42:49.840
you've already got the posters
and everything,

42:49.840 --> 42:52.120
but, ah, look, we're not investing
this much money

42:52.120 --> 42:54.040
to not have our name
on the competition.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.720
No.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.720
Excuse me?

43:10.400 --> 43:11.560
No.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.640
Nah.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.960
No. No way. No.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.680
I listened to you because I thought,

43:23.680 --> 43:26.760
well, here's a man that knows
something about manufacturing,

43:26.760 --> 43:30.520
but you don't know shit
about surf comps.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.600
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

43:31.600 --> 43:34.160
Snapper,
if it's that important to you,

43:34.160 --> 43:36.600
you can still run the surf comp.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
Thank you very much, Arthur.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.080
I will.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.360
So you're not selling?

43:46.360 --> 43:49.240
You seem like a decent guy,
but, ah...

43:49.240 --> 43:51.200
And no offence,

43:51.200 --> 43:54.840
you're just not that salty, hmm?

43:54.840 --> 44:00.040
I mean, let's face it, if you ran
this company, you'd just fuck it up.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.240
(LAUGHS)

44:18.480 --> 44:20.200
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

44:21.840 --> 44:24.280
(CAR DOOR CLOSES, ENGINE STARTS)

44:55.840 --> 44:58.240
I heard you were brawling
down at the club.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.720
Hey.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.400
Reggie!

45:01.400 --> 45:03.080
Hey, you want a beer?

45:03.080 --> 45:04.720
Looks like you've had enough
for two.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.400
Come on, have a drink.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.760
Go on, sit down.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.520
(SIGHS)

45:18.640 --> 45:20.840
If you're not gonna drink,
you can piss off, then.

45:21.960 --> 45:24.880
I really thought
you and Tracy were solid, Trot.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.200
So why, then?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.320
I don't know, Reggie.
Why do we do anything?

45:40.320 --> 45:43.120
Nah, I think she's looking
for a better reason than that, Trot.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.040
I am sorry about your beer.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.480
There's still a sip.

46:02.840 --> 46:07.320
You know, when I was a kid, man,
we moved all the time.

46:11.560 --> 46:16.320
But coming here, finding Tracy, I...

46:18.560 --> 46:19.880
It was...

46:23.240 --> 46:24.720
The way she loved me.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.720
I finally felt like I was home.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.920
But there's something in me, Reg...

46:44.680 --> 46:47.040
..as soon as I get my feet
on solid ground,

46:47.040 --> 46:49.080
I start looking at the horizon.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.480
No, mate, that's why you catch
all the best waves.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.080
(LAUGHS) It's why everything I touch
turns to shit.

47:02.600 --> 47:06.240
Buddy met up with Mac in Bali.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.880
Bali run?

47:08.880 --> 47:09.880
Oh.

47:11.040 --> 47:12.040
Shit.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.800
That's how they're getting the money
for the US licence.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.320
Still, it's not like you did it.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.200
Yeah, but I pushed them, you know?

47:25.520 --> 47:27.600
And I knew Buddy was a loose unit.

47:28.760 --> 47:33.360
To pay for a house that leaks,
for a wife who never wanted it,

47:33.360 --> 47:37.120
and don't even get me started
how much I paid for that rubber,

47:37.120 --> 47:38.120
to beat Snapper.

47:38.120 --> 47:41.120
So you're not Mr Clean anymore,
Trotter. Who cares?

47:41.120 --> 47:42.760
And who is?

47:42.760 --> 47:45.160
Yeah, well, that's the thing,
Reggie.

47:46.720 --> 47:48.240
There is more.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.560
I just...

47:51.600 --> 47:54.320
..can't tell you the whole story

47:54.320 --> 47:58.000
because then it's in your head,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.840
and I already
can't get it out of mine.

48:08.200 --> 48:09.520
Here.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.920
You know I actually hate that photo?

48:40.280 --> 48:44.200
It was like everything was good
before you all went on that trip.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.240
Yeah, I was just thinking
that same thing.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.840
Why didn't you tell me
what happened in Bali?

49:05.920 --> 49:07.400
I wanted to.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.840
But you looked so happy.

49:18.400 --> 49:21.120
Guess I thought
you deserved each other.

49:26.160 --> 49:28.240
Heard you're not selling.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.760
This town.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.040
(LAUGHS)

49:35.200 --> 49:37.120
You know,
I could've been a very rich man.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.240
You still might be.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.440
Nah, I don't think I care.

49:42.760 --> 49:44.560
When I started Bare Feet...

49:45.720 --> 49:48.280
..all I wanted
was to make enough money

49:48.280 --> 49:50.440
to live out here

49:50.440 --> 49:53.440
and surf with my mates every day.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.280
You know how often
I get out there now?

49:59.160 --> 50:01.280
I'm guessing as much as I do my art?

50:01.280 --> 50:03.240
Yeah.

50:07.440 --> 50:12.000
They finally offered me enough money
to do what I've always wanted,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.320
and I still said...no.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.600
What does that say about me?

50:41.560 --> 50:43.840
God, I've missed those lips.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.880
I didn't miss that mo.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.120
I'll shave it off.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.480
Really?

50:49.480 --> 50:51.240
Definitely not.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.480
No way.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.480
(LAUGHS)

51:08.680 --> 51:11.080
You really don't know
how to take a hint, do you?

51:11.080 --> 51:12.760
No.

51:12.760 --> 51:14.120
Not with you.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.160
What happened in Bali?

51:43.040 --> 51:44.320
(WEEPS)

51:44.320 --> 51:45.680
Hey...

51:45.680 --> 51:47.480
I've got all night.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.280
Tracy wants to sell LightWave.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.000
There's money about.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.400
It changes people.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.720
You're not selling my company.

55:11.720 --> 55:14.440
It's ours, and I'll do
what I like with my share.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.640
Well, I'm not letting this happen.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.760
No matter how hard you try
to slum it with us,

55:18.760 --> 55:20.840
you're always...
you're gonna be Newport.

55:20.840 --> 55:25.000
Family are the only people that you
should ever go into business with.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.560
So is it true?

55:29.040 --> 55:31.640
A thousand ways
to kneel and kiss the ground,

55:31.640 --> 55:34.160
a thousand ways to go home again.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.560
(LAUGHS)
