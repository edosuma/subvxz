00:11.440 --> 00:15.320
It's tough to be happy in tennis
because every single week everyone loses.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.680
But one person.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.320
<i>You get used to losing.</i>

00:23.080 --> 00:24.720
It's pretty non-stop.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.640
Minimum 30-something weeks
of the year traveling.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.400
It kills you.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.040
You just want to keep working,
keep improving.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.520
And since all I'm thinking about
is just like…

00:36.720 --> 00:38.680
doing absolutely everything
I possibly can do

00:38.760 --> 00:41.960
to like deserve to belong
with these guys in the top ten.

00:45.360 --> 00:49.560
I'm very excited for the next tournaments
because Indian Wells is going to be hot.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.400
This is not working. Whoo!

00:56.280 --> 00:57.280
Bye.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.520
That winning feeling
is just the best feeling.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.560
And the bigger the match
and the bigger the tournament,

01:06.640 --> 01:09.239
the better that winning feeling is,
you know?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.760
<i>Let's settle into tennis Paradise.</i>

01:29.840 --> 01:30.960
<i>It's Indian Wells.</i>

01:35.120 --> 01:37.440
Indian Wells is an iconic tournament.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.400
<i>Huge site in the middle of the desert.</i>

01:40.480 --> 01:44.480
It's a lot of wealth from the west coast
and celebrities and all that.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.160
I'm gonna standardize the look.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.520
There's much more money involved,
prestige and thrill.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.080
<i>The winner will net</i>
<i>over 1.2 million dollars.</i>

01:56.160 --> 01:58.120
It's a great tournament.
I just love to be there.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.320
Excuse me. Can you…?

02:00.400 --> 02:01.520
Who is this cat?

02:03.600 --> 02:07.240
It's a pretty good litmus test
for the way the year might go.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.360
It's probably the best tournament on tour.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.919
One of the best moments of my career,
and it always will be like that.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.080
<i>Winning Indian Wells</i>
<i>can change entire careers.</i>

02:20.160 --> 02:24.080
<i>It's a tournament that has always</i>
<i>been dominated by Grand Slam champions</i>

02:24.920 --> 02:27.440
<i>The stars of the tour</i>
<i>are ready to battle it out</i>

02:27.520 --> 02:30.040
<i>at a tournament known as the 5th Slam.</i>

02:30.120 --> 02:31.520
<i>In the men's competition,</i>

02:31.600 --> 02:35.680
<i>it's been 21 long years</i>
<i>since an American lifted the trophy.</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:38.000
<i>Nadal!</i>

02:38.080 --> 02:39.800
<i>And with Rafael Nadal</i>

02:39.880 --> 02:41.680
<i>steaming through his most successful start</i>

02:41.760 --> 02:43.160
<i>to the season ever,</i>

02:43.240 --> 02:46.520
<i>2022 looks set to make it</i>
<i>another tough year</i>

02:46.600 --> 02:48.160
<i>for homegrown talent.</i>

02:55.800 --> 02:57.960
-How you doing, Taylor?
-Good, how you doing?

02:58.040 --> 03:01.320
<i>I'm Taylor Fritz. I'm 24 years old.</i>

03:01.400 --> 03:04.200
<i>I'm originally</i>
<i>from Rancho Santa Fe, California.</i>

03:05.160 --> 03:08.400
It's your home state tournament.
How special of a feeling is that?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.760
It's so cool.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.600
This is the one tournament
that choose to have big results at, so…

03:14.680 --> 03:16.720
Um, it's just… It's so good.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.040
Indian Wells is one of the most
important tournaments for me.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.040
<i>I came here as a kid.</i>

03:26.200 --> 03:27.720
<i>My dad would take me.</i>

03:31.360 --> 03:34.840
<i>Good shot.</i>
<i>Taylor, eighteen and a half months old.</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:39.200
<i>My dad coached me pretty much</i>
<i>my whole life up until when I turned pro.</i>

03:40.800 --> 03:45.440
He worked me hard, and maybe at the time
I wasn't happy about it

03:45.520 --> 03:48.520
and it caused, you know, friction with us.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.480
But I know, in the end, he knew that
I'd be thankful for it all. And I am.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.280
<i>I remember one time we were</i>
<i>on center court and he said,</i>

03:58.360 --> 04:00.240
<i>"You're going to win</i>
<i>this tournament one day."</i>

04:03.040 --> 04:06.040
<i>You know, I want</i>
<i>to make my dad proud of me.</i>

04:10.960 --> 04:12.200
<i>And also, I think in the US</i>

04:12.280 --> 04:15.640
<i>we're used to always having someone</i>
<i>who's the best at everything.</i>

04:15.720 --> 04:18.520
Taylor, do you feel you can help get
tennis back to the level

04:18.600 --> 04:21.160
when Agassi and Sampras
and everyone were playing?

04:21.240 --> 04:24.040
I don't know
if I can get it back to that level.

04:24.120 --> 04:27.480
But I can definitely, uh, just help.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.360
<i>Who is the best American male right now?</i>

04:38.280 --> 04:41.480
I mean, on paper, on ranking,
that would be me.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.680
You're going to make me look
like a cocky asshole.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.360
<i>I've been moving up consistently</i>
<i>for the last couple years.</i>

04:57.360 --> 05:01.840
<i>If you take Roger</i>
<i>and Rafa and Novak out of it,</i>

05:01.920 --> 05:03.800
<i>I've beaten every other player.</i>

05:11.680 --> 05:13.640
<i>But I've never won a major tournament.</i>

05:13.720 --> 05:17.280
This could be the year.
This is the year that I feel up for it.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
<i>When we started dating, I was ranked 24.</i>

05:25.000 --> 05:27.840
-Yeah.
-And then what was my low point?

05:27.920 --> 05:31.360
-Forty one? Forty three, yeah.
-Forty two, forty three? Maybe.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.440
It was hard to watch you
so stressed about your ranking,

05:34.520 --> 05:38.000
but you also had a hard time
and would never talk to me about it.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.200
But I knew how hard on yourself you were.

05:42.280 --> 05:47.800
It's a process of top ten and top eight
and top five and top three and then, one.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.640
You're on your way.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.600
Taylor's really hard on himself sometimes,

05:54.680 --> 05:57.840
but it's not
a super rewarding sport for most.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.400
<i>Who knows where I'd be right now</i>

06:01.920 --> 06:03.440
<i>if we weren't together.</i>

06:05.240 --> 06:07.560
<i>She's been with me</i>
<i>for the last two and a half years,</i>

06:07.640 --> 06:10.040
<i>and they've been the best of my career.</i>

06:11.640 --> 06:14.000
<i>We met on a dating app.</i>

06:14.080 --> 06:18.400
That's how everyone our age meets,
so I don't feel weird saying that anymore.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.160
<i>American Taylor Fritz at Indian Wells.</i>

06:21.240 --> 06:23.200
<i>When we're at a tournament now,</i>

06:23.280 --> 06:27.000
<i>she is trying to do whatever she can</i>
<i>to help me.</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:28.720
You know, I feel like, um,

06:29.360 --> 06:32.360
what we've built is more like, uh,
almost like a team.

06:42.520 --> 06:45.680
<i>On the men's side,</i>
<i>Rafa might be the player to be,</i>

06:45.760 --> 06:48.720
<i>but for the women</i>
<i>there's no clear favorite.</i>

06:49.360 --> 06:53.840
<i>As world number one, Ash Barty,</i>
<i>stays away amid rumors of retirement.</i>

06:54.400 --> 06:56.560
<i>Just who could take her place?</i>

06:56.640 --> 07:00.120
With Ash Barty's possible retirement,
it's a massive opportunity

07:00.200 --> 07:02.400
for all the players here in Indian Wells.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.720
I'm Maria Sakkari.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.640
I'm from Greece.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.280
And I want to, um,

07:23.360 --> 07:25.520
I want to be number one in the world.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.920
<i>What's your worst fear?</i>

07:30.160 --> 07:31.440
Failure.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.920
<i>She's built like a Greek god.</i>

07:38.000 --> 07:39.840
She can run for days.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.120
<i>She can be more physical</i>
<i>than most players on tour.</i>

07:46.440 --> 07:48.480
She's one of the best players
in the world.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.760
Maria… On the course she's so intense.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.920
<i>And then off the course</i>
<i>she's like the biggest teddy bear.</i>

08:00.880 --> 08:02.480
She's a true friend.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.440
<i>Maria hasn't won a big title.</i>

08:14.120 --> 08:18.360
<i>And that has been the knock</i>
<i>on her career so far.</i>

08:20.320 --> 08:22.120
Hi, Mom.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.800
-Would you like a coffee?
-Yes.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.840
I'm excited to go.
It's just that I'm feeling a bit anxious.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.960
I want to reach the finals.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.280
You know that, Maria?

08:39.360 --> 08:45.000
The most important thing
is to enjoy what you're doing.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.880
Because if you're happy on court,
you'll perform better.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.360
<i>My mom was a professional tennis player.</i>

08:53.440 --> 08:56.880
She was the one who made tennis
in Greece an actual sport.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.440
<i>Maria has sacrificed</i>
<i>a lot from a young age.</i>

09:05.640 --> 09:09.800
<i>Only her own demons or an injury</i>

09:09.880 --> 09:12.720
<i>can keep her out from the tennis court.</i>

09:13.960 --> 09:17.160
<i>Because tennis players</i>
<i>don't just lose to their opponents,</i>

09:17.240 --> 09:18.560
<i>they lose to themselves.</i>

09:30.360 --> 09:32.520
<i>This is big time.</i>
<i>This is Indian Wells.</i>

09:32.600 --> 09:35.760
Let's go. Let's fucking go.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.200
<i>Maria Sakkari!</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:42.360
<i>Of course only half of these players</i>

09:42.440 --> 09:44.400
<i>will move on after the first round.</i>

09:45.600 --> 09:47.320
<i>Let's get into it.</i>

09:52.120 --> 09:54.080
Game. Frances Tiafoe.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.080
<i>Another straight set win.</i>

09:58.160 --> 09:59.240
<i>Both men and women</i>

09:59.320 --> 10:02.280
<i>are playing the best</i>
<i>of three sets to win the match.</i>

10:02.360 --> 10:06.120
It is stressful for all the seeds,
the opening round, just trying to get by.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.040
<i>Definitely nervous.</i>

10:08.680 --> 10:10.240
<i>Incredible stuff.</i>

10:10.320 --> 10:12.240
<i>Fritz moves on in the desert.</i>

10:17.080 --> 10:18.520
<i>Her fans are happy.</i>

10:19.840 --> 10:22.160
<i>Maria Sakkari is happy. She gets it done.</i>

10:24.040 --> 10:27.480
<i>Come one, make</i>
<i>some noise everyone for Maria Sakkari.</i>

10:30.000 --> 10:32.480
<i>It's hard for me even to put into words</i>

10:32.560 --> 10:36.000
<i>how it feels when you hear</i>
<i>that game set match.</i>

10:38.040 --> 10:39.480
<i>It's an addiction.</i>

10:43.440 --> 10:44.920
I'm sweating.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.560
Gosh, I feel so good right now.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.320
-I feel so good.
-Me, too.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.920
<i>Tom is probably</i>
<i>the youngest coach on the WTA Tour.</i>

10:58.400 --> 11:02.200
He's more than a coach to me.
He's my best friend.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.520
There's a lot more to my job
than just time on the court.

11:15.760 --> 11:20.000
I'm also talking to Maria
about her emotions, her psychology.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.400
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

11:21.480 --> 11:23.560
<i>the player is the one</i>
<i>that has to go out there and do it.</i>

11:23.640 --> 11:25.600
<i>She has to believe in herself.</i>

11:25.680 --> 11:27.280
-Coffee time?
-Yes.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.760
It's my sixth espresso today.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.360
Do you think I'm the player
that drinks the most coffees on the tour?

11:34.440 --> 11:37.120
-By far.
-I think it's a lot.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.440
Okay, do you want to talk about the match?
Because it was quite good.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.960
-Was it?
-I think so.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.000
What do you think, honestly?

11:48.080 --> 11:51.200
Even though
my tennis was not ten out of ten,

11:52.440 --> 11:53.440
mentally,

11:54.360 --> 11:55.800
I was eleven out of ten.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.240
Mentally, you were fantastic.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.440
I'm not trying to put you
into pressure to be perfect,

12:01.160 --> 12:03.280
but you know, as the rounds go on,

12:03.360 --> 12:05.720
you're playing really good players.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.600
The margins are like that.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.000
I want you to be disciplined.
In big moments, be disciplined.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.320
I don't know. I feel like
I can trust myself and I do trust myself.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.760
-Which is, I think, very good.
-That's good. You should trust yourself.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.240
<i>Maria's had a tough time.</i>

12:25.320 --> 12:26.880
<i>She lost a few semis in a row.</i>

12:31.040 --> 12:32.640
In tennis, these things
weigh on your head.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.200
And sometimes,
the closer you get to winning,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.440
and then losing, it almost hurts more.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.920
Here in Indian Wells,
the goal is to win the tournament.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.040
<i>Maria Sakkari.</i>

12:48.880 --> 12:50.920
<i>That is outstanding.</i>

12:51.000 --> 12:54.240
I can be myself.
I can be Maria Sakkari.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.360
Just doing what I love.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.560
<i>That ball goes long</i>

13:00.640 --> 13:03.560
<i>and Maria Sakkari</i>
<i>is into the fourth round at Indian Wells.</i>

13:11.680 --> 13:15.440
<i>Taylor Fritz is into</i>
<i>the Indian Wells quarterfinals.</i>

13:15.520 --> 13:17.800
<i>He has had to work mighty hard.</i>

13:21.680 --> 13:25.400
<i>And Maria Sakkari is</i>
<i>semifinal bound at Indian Wells.</i>

13:25.480 --> 13:28.800
When you're happy, you're enjoying
yourself and everything goes your way.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.160
<i>The American Taylor Fritz</i>
<i>moves himself a spot</i>

13:35.240 --> 13:37.440
<i>in the semifinals at Indian Wells.</i>

13:41.920 --> 13:45.920
Can I get an omelet with bacon, ham,
and a little bit of cheese?

13:47.280 --> 13:49.000
Yeah. Thank you.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.760
<i>No matter what your level is,</i>

13:51.240 --> 13:53.720
<i>you're only as good as your mind lets you.</i>

13:56.040 --> 13:58.360
Your mind is what's going to drive

13:58.440 --> 14:01.480
your ability to achieve
what you want to achieve on the court.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.680
-What's up, Hollywood?
-What's up?

14:05.760 --> 14:07.840
<i>My name is Paul Annocone.</i>

14:07.920 --> 14:11.040
<i>I've been fortunate enough</i>
<i>to coach a few of the all-time greats.</i>

14:11.120 --> 14:13.400
<i>Pete Sampras and Roger Federer.</i>

14:13.480 --> 14:15.560
Now I've got the good fortune
of working with Taylor Fritz.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.800
Good luck, Taylor.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.120
<i>Taylor Fritz</i>
<i>is one of the toughest,</i>

14:21.200 --> 14:24.120
<i>most strong-willed players</i>
<i>I've ever been around.</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:27.280
<i>That's probably his biggest asset.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.600
<i>It's also probably his biggest liability.</i>

14:34.760 --> 14:37.960
<i>Semifinals Saturday</i>
<i>in Tennis Paradise. It's Indian Wells.</i>

14:39.360 --> 14:42.280
<i>Taylor Fritz,</i>
<i>the last American in the draw.</i>

14:43.240 --> 14:46.440
<i>The California boy.</i>
<i>He takes on Andrey Rublev.</i>

14:46.520 --> 14:49.240
<i>To play even Nadal or Alcaraz.</i>

14:50.080 --> 14:51.080
<i>Rublev.</i>

14:51.160 --> 14:53.480
<i>He's on a 13-match win steak.</i>

14:54.800 --> 14:56.920
<i>Maybe on paper I'm not the favorite.</i>

14:57.000 --> 14:58.360
But in my mind, I am.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.560
<i>He's from just</i>
<i>a couple of freeways away.</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:06.000
<i>It's Taylor Fritz.</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:16.000
<i>When I'm coaching Taylor Fritz,</i>
<i>I look at three categories.</i>

15:16.640 --> 15:18.000
Taylor Fritz to serve.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.640
<i>Physical talents is what you have.</i>

15:22.720 --> 15:24.160
<i>The skill set.</i>

15:24.920 --> 15:27.840
<i>The strength, the conditioning,</i>
<i>the mobility, the jumping.</i>

15:28.480 --> 15:30.200
<i>A lot of that's God given.</i>

15:30.280 --> 15:31.680
<i>And it is what it is.</i>

15:34.000 --> 15:35.280
Taylor Fritz.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.840
Fritz. He's three games. Two down.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.760
Good start. Good start.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.680
<i>The second category is the heart.</i>

15:48.240 --> 15:50.640
<i>And that's the unconditional competing.</i>

15:51.560 --> 15:55.440
<i>Can you play every point</i>
<i>like your life depends on it?</i>

16:11.920 --> 16:15.880
<i>The first set</i>
<i>goes the way of the Californian.</i>

16:17.200 --> 16:19.520
<i>He's hardly put</i>
<i>a foot wrong so far.</i>

16:22.600 --> 16:23.840
<i>And then is the head.</i>

16:24.920 --> 16:27.200
<i>The head is your ability to process</i>

16:27.280 --> 16:31.000
<i>without letting the emotion overwhelm you.</i>

16:36.680 --> 16:37.680
Fritz.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.920
<i>Be careful there, Rublev.</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:43.200
<i>Goodness me, my leg was hurting</i>
<i>just watching that.</i>

16:43.280 --> 16:46.320
<i>Rublev. He just wants it so badly.</i>

16:47.920 --> 16:49.600
<i>It's a passion.</i>

16:49.680 --> 16:52.360
<i>Spills over into anger and rage.</i>

16:55.120 --> 16:56.640
<i>Evidence of the frustration…</i>

17:01.760 --> 17:05.880
<i>Fritz is still relaxed and he's only</i>
<i>a few points away from the final.</i>

17:07.240 --> 17:09.359
<i>At the biggest moment</i>
<i>in your life…</i>

17:17.160 --> 17:18.400
<i>It's only you.</i>

17:20.119 --> 17:21.560
<i>It's dead silent.</i>

17:22.400 --> 17:27.079
<i>Those three categories better be in line,</i>
<i>or else you're going to fail miserably.</i>

17:27.599 --> 17:28.599
<i>Match point.</i>

17:35.440 --> 17:38.320
<i>It is victory for Taylor Fritz.</i>

17:39.120 --> 17:41.280
<i>He's done it in California.</i>

17:41.360 --> 17:44.400
<i>What a special moment for the 24 year old.</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:45.920
<i>He can hardly believe it.</i>

17:46.680 --> 17:49.280
<i>It's the biggest final of his career.</i>

17:53.240 --> 17:56.480
<i>I think Taylor was starting to believe,</i>

17:56.560 --> 17:58.400
<i>"I can do this."</i>

17:58.920 --> 18:00.960
<i>And he was starting to believe</i>
<i>that key component.</i>

18:06.000 --> 18:08.360
<i>But still there are those times</i>
<i>when you have to grab him</i>

18:08.440 --> 18:09.960
<i>when he comes off the match.</i>

18:10.040 --> 18:12.680
<i>"That was terrible."</i>
<i>"I can't do this, I can't do that."</i>

18:12.760 --> 18:13.880
Good job, bro.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.800
-Don't let him get--
-Proud of you. Good job.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.720
-2:30.
-Get on the bike.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.760
I'll tell you…

18:22.040 --> 18:23.280
2:30.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.920
…playing someone who sat on the fence

18:25.000 --> 18:27.560
and spun the shit out of the ball
for three hours,

18:27.640 --> 18:30.200
made it impossible to hit a ball
for a set and a half.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.320
Cool. Skip, jump on the bike.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.440
All the decisions I made in the game

18:36.520 --> 18:39.520
were actually the right decisions,
just bad execution.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.160
We're not talking
about the result of the game,

18:41.240 --> 18:42.680
we're just talking about the mindset.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.680
And I'm saying, my mindset was good and…

18:45.760 --> 18:49.080
Remember how you told me to tell you
when things aren't in a top-ten mentality?

18:49.160 --> 18:52.120
-That isn't. I can promise you that.
-Okay.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.760
<i>We'll have to grab him</i>
<i>and say, "Taylor,</i>

18:54.840 --> 18:56.600
everybody comes up with great shots.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.840
Everybody comes up
with head-scratchers that are bad."

18:59.920 --> 19:01.400
That's life. That's tennis.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.320
When you berate yourself
and don't stop and you get so uptight

19:05.400 --> 19:07.280
and you beat the shit out of yourself,

19:07.360 --> 19:10.320
it is really hard to the just focus
on the next point

19:10.400 --> 19:12.240
and be clear, committed and confident.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.560
You did a much better job
once you got composed.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.960
You didn't play great today,
but you figured it out.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.360
That's a sign of someone
who's going to win.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.040
<i>The methodology has to be</i>
<i>"Don't want it too bad."</i>

19:29.120 --> 19:32.120
<i>Because self-imposed pressure is, to me,</i>

19:32.200 --> 19:36.360
the biggest catalyst to paralyze
your ability to maximize your talent.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.760
<i>I played, I think,</i>
<i>seven or eight semifinals last year.</i>

19:47.040 --> 19:51.360
<i>And I was just struggling</i>
<i>because I could see the finish line</i>

19:51.440 --> 19:54.680
<i>and then I wouldn't win the match.</i>

19:55.680 --> 19:59.880
My mind would go so far in a match
that I just couldn't close it out.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.400
<i>I was too excited.</i>

20:05.040 --> 20:07.160
<i>I was nearly there.</i>

20:08.040 --> 20:09.920
<i>But not there at the same time.</i>

20:11.720 --> 20:15.080
And there are a lot of losses
that hurt, even today,

20:15.600 --> 20:17.280
like the one last year in Paris.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.960
<i>The chances of Maria Sakkari</i>

20:19.040 --> 20:21.680
<i>have just ebbed away here.</i>

20:23.080 --> 20:25.520
Game, set, and match: Krejčíková.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.920
<i>Nothing</i>
<i>that Maria Sakkari could do today.</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:31.240
<i>I lost that match</i>
<i>from being match point up.</i>

20:32.400 --> 20:34.920
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>how to handle that situation.</i>

20:37.080 --> 20:38.560
<i>I couldn't sleep for three days.</i>

20:38.640 --> 20:43.120
<i>I was just lying in bed</i>
<i>and trying to sleep,</i>

20:43.200 --> 20:46.360
<i>but I was so nervous and so sad.</i>

20:46.920 --> 20:48.760
<i>It was tough for me to handle.</i>

20:49.760 --> 20:53.320
<i>And I told my coaches</i>
<i>that I want to retire from tennis.</i>

20:53.400 --> 20:55.120
<i>And I retired for four days.</i>

20:58.800 --> 21:01.320
<i>And then I was on a Greek island.</i>

21:02.000 --> 21:07.080
<i>And I just called Tom and I said, "Okay,</i>
<i>when can we start practicing again?"</i>

21:08.440 --> 21:12.160
"Coming back from retirement."
That's how we've been calling it.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.080
<i>Paula versus Maria.</i>

21:31.160 --> 21:33.200
<i>It's an incredibly</i>
<i>highly anticipated match.</i>

21:33.280 --> 21:36.800
Because these are two players
who have put themselves in the top ten,

21:36.880 --> 21:41.560
<i>had great starts to the season,</i>
<i>Paula's defending the title here.</i>

21:41.640 --> 21:42.760
I'm in a very good position.

21:42.840 --> 21:47.920
<i>I won the tournament last year.</i>
<i>I want to live that emotion again.</i>

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
But when you play as a favorite,
it's tricky

21:51.080 --> 21:53.840
because you're opening a place
with nothing to lose.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.600
Ready. Play.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.400
Bravo! Let's go!

22:18.320 --> 22:21.120
<i>Massive start here</i>
<i>from the Greek. Setting the tone.</i>

22:21.200 --> 22:23.960
<i>She's playing brave,</i>
<i>but she's going after the ball.</i>

22:24.040 --> 22:25.600
Good play. It's a good play.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.560
<i>I'm in the zone.</i>

22:28.640 --> 22:30.880
Great job, Maria. Great job.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.840
<i>I've never seen her</i>
<i>hit the forehand that well.</i>

22:34.920 --> 22:37.640
<i>Maria is playing lights-out tennis.</i>

22:47.040 --> 22:49.720
<i>I just want Maria</i>
<i>to keep this mentality.</i>

22:50.400 --> 22:51.440
<i>No way!</i>

23:01.040 --> 23:02.520
Game. Badosa.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.080
She's going into that mode again.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.320
Game. Badosa.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.720
<i>If she's starting to panic,</i>

23:16.120 --> 23:19.080
<i>I'm the person she's going</i>
<i>to take out her frustration on.</i>

23:19.160 --> 23:21.680
<i>I don't speak Greek, but she'll start</i>
<i>speaking in Greek it to me.</i>

23:21.760 --> 23:23.840
-She's asking if she's rushing.
-No, perfect.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.480
Let's go, Maria.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.480
<i>I see her starting to glare at me.</i>

23:30.560 --> 23:32.920
<i>Sakkari is starting to feel frustrated.</i>

23:33.760 --> 23:35.320
<i>Oh-uh, this is not good.</i>

23:37.160 --> 23:40.240
Set. Badosa.

23:40.320 --> 23:45.360
If she can get her head into a good place,
she could easily win this first set.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.080
<i>I need to try</i>
<i>and do something different</i>

23:48.160 --> 23:50.520
<i>just to kind of maybe throw her off.</i>

23:51.160 --> 23:52.760
<i>I remember standing up.</i>

23:55.040 --> 23:57.520
<i>And Maria looked at me like,</i>
<i>"Why are you standing up?"</i>

23:59.040 --> 24:00.560
Set.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.680
It just distracted her mind.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.640
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
<i>Keep the arm loose.</i>
<i>Keep the arm loose.</i>

24:15.600 --> 24:17.880
<i>That is outstanding.</i>

24:17.960 --> 24:19.760
Point by point. Point by point.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.720
<i>Closing out these big matches.</i>

24:22.800 --> 24:25.040
<i>It's sometimes been</i>
<i>so difficult for Sakkari.</i>

24:30.120 --> 24:32.400
Stay in the moment. Let's go.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.920
<i>Match point.</i>

24:36.000 --> 24:39.960
<i>Sakkari serving for a place</i>
<i>in the biggest final of her career.</i>

24:49.320 --> 24:53.760
<i>Few players deserve</i>
<i>moments like this more than Maria Sakkari.</i>

24:53.840 --> 24:56.280
<i>Through to the biggest final</i>
<i>of her career.</i>

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
<i>An understandably emotional reaction</i>

25:00.160 --> 25:04.000
<i>to a huge moment</i>
<i>against last year's winner.</i>

25:05.840 --> 25:07.920
<i>Paula Badosa.</i>

25:19.680 --> 25:21.360
<i>I couldn't defend the title.</i>

25:24.120 --> 25:27.560
<i>I really wanted to feel the same emotions</i>

25:27.640 --> 25:29.200
<i>I felt the last time.</i>

25:30.840 --> 25:31.960
<i>She's a fighter.</i>

25:32.920 --> 25:33.920
Maria!

25:35.320 --> 25:37.240
-Good job!
-Thank you.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.320
I'm so proud of you, Maria.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.520
All good. All good.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.520
Some way
to serve it out as well, huh?

26:21.600 --> 26:25.000
That was the best way
I've ever closed out a match.

26:38.040 --> 26:41.520
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>In Indian Wells, we have our final four.</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:45.640
<i>Maria Sakkari will take on</i>
<i>the Grand Slam winning Iga Swiatek</i>

26:45.720 --> 26:51.240
<i>and California kid, Taylor Fritz,</i>
<i>will face off against Rafael Nadal.</i>

26:55.640 --> 26:59.840
<i>I play Rafa Nadal</i>
<i>in the finals of Indian Wells.</i>

27:03.520 --> 27:05.680
<i>It's what you worked</i>
<i>your whole life to do.</i>

27:16.840 --> 27:19.640
<i>I had only</i>
<i>played Rafa once before.</i>

27:21.360 --> 27:24.000
<i>That would've been the other</i>
<i>biggest match of my life.</i>

27:25.080 --> 27:26.360
<i>He got me pretty good.</i>

27:27.880 --> 27:29.080
<i>Now it's different.</i>

27:30.000 --> 27:32.480
<i>I can trust my game and play within myself</i>

27:32.560 --> 27:36.480
and not think I have to do
all this crazy stuff until I, you know,

27:37.120 --> 27:38.800
think I have a chance at winning.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.160
Good night.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.880
<i>One of the toughest things</i>
<i>about it</i>

27:45.960 --> 27:48.920
<i>it's kind of convincing yourself</i>
<i>that you can beat this guy.</i>

27:53.800 --> 27:55.680
<i>You can beat this guy that never gives up.</i>

27:55.760 --> 27:58.800
<i>He literally comes back</i>
<i>from being down all the time.</i>

28:00.680 --> 28:04.920
<i>Someone who's just going to fight</i>
<i>for every single point until the end.</i>

28:06.400 --> 28:09.000
<i>Who's obviously been</i>
<i>in this situation a ton of times.</i>

28:13.080 --> 28:14.840
<i>This is just another day for him.</i>

28:20.400 --> 28:21.880
It's the biggest match of my life.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.600
P <i>laying guys like Nadal,</i>
<i>you know… he can't get nervous.</i>

28:53.680 --> 28:55.440
<i>He can't even afford to get nervous</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

28:55.520 --> 29:00.880
Um, he can't afford
to get, like, tight on a certain shot

29:00.960 --> 29:03.840
because he's playing fucking Nadal.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.640
It's crazy coming
to this tournament as a kid and then…

29:08.320 --> 29:13.160
We were sitting here last night,
I was like, "I'm in the finals tomorrow."

29:13.240 --> 29:17.640
I didn't even, you know…
It hasn't even fully, like, set in, so…

29:17.720 --> 29:18.760
Uh…

29:19.880 --> 29:21.800
I just got to kind take myself

29:22.760 --> 29:24.680
out of that mindset and, you know,

29:24.760 --> 29:26.920
I just came all this way so…

29:27.000 --> 29:30.760
Just one more match to go.
I might as well win that last match.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.840
<i>Players will always want to get</i>
<i>a little bit of practice in</i>

29:41.920 --> 29:43.600
<i>before their matches.</i>

29:44.520 --> 29:48.680
<i>The practice the day of the match is</i>
<i>really the only time you're going to get</i>

29:48.760 --> 29:51.960
<i>to work on the little details</i>
<i>that are going to make a difference.</i>

30:01.800 --> 30:03.240
Ouch!

30:03.320 --> 30:04.800
Fuck.

30:06.600 --> 30:11.120
-Where'd you feel it on, mate?
-That hurts so fucking bad.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.520
<i>A couple balls into the practice,</i>

30:14.600 --> 30:18.120
<i>when I push off to move to the left,</i>
<i>it's the sharpest pain.</i>

30:18.200 --> 30:19.200
<i>It's the right ankle.</i>

30:20.000 --> 30:20.960
Fuck.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.920
<i>It was just a sharp pain.</i>

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
<i>Like nine out of ten on the scale of…</i>

30:29.840 --> 30:31.120
<i>It just hurt so bad.</i>

30:32.400 --> 30:33.880
<i>I'm thinking like,</i>

30:33.960 --> 30:34.880
<i>"That's it."</i>

30:34.960 --> 30:36.280
<i>It's the biggest match of my life.</i>

30:36.360 --> 30:38.920
<i>And I'm going to have to pull out.</i>
<i>I can't even play.</i>

30:51.240 --> 30:55.040
-We're sure you're going to do it.
-Yeah.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.280
<i>Finals day in Tennis Paradise.</i>

31:10.040 --> 31:12.680
<i>PNB Paribas Open 2022.</i>

31:14.920 --> 31:16.840
<i>I've achieved great things in tennis.</i>

31:17.720 --> 31:19.640
-Good luck tonight.
-Thank you.

31:20.760 --> 31:24.120
<i>I know that I can achieve</i>
<i>even better and bigger things.</i>

31:26.840 --> 31:31.280
Mentally I'm prepared to handle
the emotions going into a final.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.160
<i>Maria has a great run of form,</i>

31:37.080 --> 31:40.120
<i>but Swiatek has played bigger finals.</i>

31:40.200 --> 31:42.280
<i>She's played a Grand Slam final.</i>

31:43.000 --> 31:45.040
<i>She's already won a WTA 1000.</i>

31:45.640 --> 31:49.920
<i>And this is literally the biggest match</i>
<i>Maria has ever played in her life.</i>

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
And back.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.160
Good. Relax.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.760
When serving, if you're with the wind,

32:07.840 --> 32:11.360
you can use good kick serves,
it's going to bounce so high.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.920
Against the wind,
I'd go more slice to bring it down.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.440
Guys, this is sand in the air.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.200
Yeah, I got it in my mouth.

32:32.880 --> 32:36.200
<i>For me, it's just a dream</i>
<i>coming true being here.</i>

32:45.040 --> 32:46.240
<i>I can do it.</i>

32:51.480 --> 32:52.920
<i>She comes to Indian Wells</i>

32:53.000 --> 32:55.440
<i>at a career high ranking</i>
<i>of number six in the world.</i>

32:55.520 --> 32:58.600
<i>From Greece, Maria Sakkari.</i>

33:01.640 --> 33:03.560
<i>She's a Grand Slam champion.</i>

33:03.640 --> 33:05.440
<i>She won Roland-Garros in 2020.</i>

33:05.520 --> 33:08.040
<i>From Poland, Iga Swiatek.</i>

33:12.760 --> 33:14.000
Go, Maria. Let's go.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
<i>Long way to go, but…</i>

33:33.720 --> 33:35.080
<i>What a start for the Greek.</i>

33:35.160 --> 33:36.400
Good job.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.200
-Come on, let's go.
-Great job. Maria. Great job.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.960
Sakkari leads. Two games to one.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.040
Nice shot.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.280
Nice shot.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.400
Good legs there, Maria.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.200
Game.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.520
Swiatek.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.840
Relax the arm.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.719
Game. Swiatek.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.840
Keep playing to the middle.
It's fine. You've got this.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.880
-I went middle and she went on the line.
-Yeah?

34:22.960 --> 34:25.040
-Fuck me!
-Keep making her go middle.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.560
<i>Keep going.</i>

34:30.360 --> 34:31.560
<i>Keep trying.</i>

34:32.719 --> 34:34.040
<i>Keep fighting for it.</i>

34:42.960 --> 34:46.440
Game and first set. Sakkari.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.400
<i>First set to Swiatek. Six-four.</i>

34:50.600 --> 34:51.920
<i>I just want to cry.</i>

34:53.840 --> 34:56.400
<i>But I was always a fighter.</i>

34:57.239 --> 35:01.280
<i>That's what got me to where I am today.</i>

35:08.600 --> 35:10.440
Game. Swiatek.

35:10.520 --> 35:13.840
<i>Maria Sakkari needs to get back into it.</i>

35:15.560 --> 35:17.280
<i>He just wouldn't rule her out.</i>

35:26.560 --> 35:27.800
Let's go. Let's go!

35:29.840 --> 35:31.280
<i>Maria has to fight for it.</i>

35:32.040 --> 35:33.800
Could be the greatest comeback ever.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.960
<i>Your heart starts beating faster.</i>

35:38.440 --> 35:40.360
She needs to stay strong mentally.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.640
<i>And then you struggle with your movement.</i>

35:43.800 --> 35:45.480
<i>You struggle hitting the ball.</i>

35:45.560 --> 35:47.720
Play everything through
the middle of the court.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.360
One more word
and I will break the racket.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.440
It doesn't matter.
Every ball through the middle.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.880
Advantage, Swiatek.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.120
She's getting stuck.

36:04.400 --> 36:05.920
<i>What is happening to me?</i>

36:08.040 --> 36:09.240
Deuce.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.800
Go to hell. Nothing goes in.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.000
<i>Dangerous territory here, Sakkari.</i>

36:15.080 --> 36:18.320
Anything we say now
is going to piss her off more.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.200
<i>When you want things so badly…</i>

36:23.280 --> 36:25.520
This is a mental capitulation.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.320
<i>…sometimes you just can't handle</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>

36:32.120 --> 36:35.960
<i>It's like two little creatures</i>
<i>inside of me just fighting.</i>

36:43.000 --> 36:44.120
<i>Championship point.</i>

36:45.680 --> 36:47.600
<i>This is my final chance.</i>

36:56.440 --> 36:59.280
Game. Iga Swiatek.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.160
<i>Indian Wells has a new champion.</i>

37:07.920 --> 37:10.400
Congratulate you and may I present to you

37:10.480 --> 37:14.360
your 2022 BNP Paribas Open
Women's Singles champion,

37:14.440 --> 37:16.520
Iga Swiatek.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.120
<i>All the pressure I had</i>
<i>all these years… it just came out.</i>

37:33.600 --> 37:35.480
<i>It was horrible.</i>

37:37.920 --> 37:39.040
<i>I just want to cry.</i>

37:40.120 --> 37:41.720
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

37:43.880 --> 37:45.160
<i>You're not yourself.</i>

37:47.400 --> 37:50.160
<i>I was not the Maria I was</i>
<i>for the entire two weeks.</i>

37:53.160 --> 37:56.720
<i>That emotional win against Paula</i>
<i>in the semifinals</i>

37:56.800 --> 38:00.040
<i>just took away a lot of energy from me.</i>

38:12.400 --> 38:15.440
<i>Even losing is part of the game.</i>

38:16.920 --> 38:18.080
<i>We all learn</i>

38:18.800 --> 38:19.840
<i>how to lose.</i>

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
<i>Unless you are</i>

38:22.640 --> 38:25.560
<i>Roger, Rafa or Novak.</i>

38:26.520 --> 38:28.000
<i>That's a different story.</i>

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
<i>The rest of us…</i>

38:31.560 --> 38:33.640
<i>we're going to lose more than we win.</i>

38:37.640 --> 38:40.160
But we need to get
some extra strong stuff,

38:40.240 --> 38:42.600
so the doctor is going to have
to prescribe it.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.240
Yeah.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.720
Anybody in there?

38:48.800 --> 38:51.280
Is one of you gentlemen a doctor?

38:52.440 --> 38:53.720
It's so painful.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.520
-I know.
-That would be weird…

38:55.600 --> 38:58.240
-It's deep in there.
-Yeah, painful.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.200
So we can… Yeah.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.520
Pain is like unmatched
to anything I've ever felt.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.320
This is so fucking painful.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.840
-More painful…
-Can you see where that bursa is?

39:07.920 --> 39:09.320
The most pain I've experienced.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.880
You may have a little fracture.
We're not… And then you…

39:12.960 --> 39:14.440
You could cause more harm than good.

39:15.160 --> 39:17.080
We could also just inject the bursa

39:17.720 --> 39:19.800
and see if that takes away the pain.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.720
Potential good versus potential harm.

39:22.800 --> 39:28.080
If this is my son, playing this match…
What I do want him to do?

39:28.160 --> 39:32.000
It's really hard for me to believe
that numbing it up is the right thing.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.480
Anything I can do to just, like,
try to get on the court.

39:34.560 --> 39:38.680
I'd much rather go out there and at least
try to play a game or two

39:38.760 --> 39:43.200
than to just pull out
and not even take the court at all to try.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.520
-You want to try, right?
-Yeah, of course.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.640
This is good.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.200
-I'll do whatever I can.
-Of course.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.080
<i>I've trained my whole life</i>
<i>for this moment.</i>

39:57.960 --> 40:01.160
<i>If I pulled out,</i>
<i>I'd be thinking about this forever.</i>

40:10.600 --> 40:12.840
You can't see it, but you're hesitating.

40:13.640 --> 40:18.040
This, to me, is a 60 percent showing
of what you can do.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.800
Let me try. It's all I'm asking.
I'll pull the plug if it's not there.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.400
You want to go out there
with 17,000 people--

40:24.480 --> 40:28.360
-It's better than not going out there.
-No, not at all. Totally not.

40:28.440 --> 40:32.120
I feel like I'm good enough right now
to give it a shot.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.760
-Against him in this wind?
-Why the fuck not?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.720
Would you be willing to walk on court,

40:37.800 --> 40:41.440
play at 60 percent,
and then we get the diagnostics?

40:41.520 --> 40:45.000
You made it worse and now you can't play
for maybe one or two months.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.760
We're wasting time

40:46.840 --> 40:50.400
because I need to get another injection
if I'm going to play.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.040
<i>Listening to Paul say</i>

40:53.120 --> 40:55.840
<i>he cannot go out and play right now,</i>

40:55.920 --> 41:00.760
that is horrifying for me
because playing with a foot injury,

41:00.840 --> 41:02.400
<i>that could be career ending.</i>

41:02.480 --> 41:03.880
Do you know how many
of these I've rehabbed?

41:03.960 --> 41:05.600
I've rehabbed 200 at least.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.000
It will make it worse.

41:07.080 --> 41:08.320
It will flare you up.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.920
You will miss minimum one event,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.120
possibly multiple events.

41:13.640 --> 41:17.920
Everything we're doing is trying to be
in your best interest, you know that.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.440
-I'm sorry I'm so stubborn.
-I know you're competitive.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.400
I know I'm just fighting with you guys.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.200
-That's what fucking makes you so good.
-I want to try.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.320
I know.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.240
<i>It is finals day. Just two remain.</i>

41:36.320 --> 41:38.520
<i>It promises to be such a great final,</i>

41:38.600 --> 41:41.000
<i>but there's a lot of uncertainty</i>
<i>over Taylor Fritz.</i>

41:41.080 --> 41:43.240
<i>Some injury concerns, in particular.</i>

41:43.320 --> 41:47.000
<i>Nadal isn't without</i>
<i>his injury concerns either, is he?</i>

41:47.080 --> 41:49.960
<i>Earlier in the week, it was the foot</i>
<i>was bothering him so much.</i>

41:50.040 --> 41:53.320
A <i>southern</i>
<i>California native is through to the finals</i>

41:53.400 --> 41:56.960
<i>it's American Taylor Fritz!</i>

41:57.040 --> 41:59.320
Come on, come on! Come on, Fritzy!

42:00.200 --> 42:01.960
<i>There hasn't been</i>
<i>an American champion</i>

42:02.040 --> 42:03.840
<i>in Indian Wells since 2001.</i>

42:03.920 --> 42:05.440
<i>That was Agassi.</i>

42:06.240 --> 42:08.520
<i>A little bit of nerves is a good thing.</i>

42:09.280 --> 42:12.520
<i>Two-time</i>
<i>Olympic gold medalist from Spain,</i>

42:12.600 --> 42:15.680
<i>Rafael Nadal!</i>

42:18.840 --> 42:24.440
<i>Rafa Nadal, looking</i>
<i>to make it 21 victories this season.</i>

42:24.520 --> 42:27.480
<i>Undefeated this year.</i>
<i>Looking for a fourth title.</i>

42:27.560 --> 42:30.560
<i>This is the biggest match</i>
<i>of Taylor Fritz's career.</i>

42:34.920 --> 42:38.120
<i>And feels fit enough to start this match,</i>
<i>which is great news.</i>

42:38.600 --> 42:40.560
<i>There's a difference</i>
<i>between "can play"</i>

42:40.640 --> 42:42.240
<i>and feeling you can win the match.</i>

42:42.320 --> 42:45.640
<i>But, if I pulled out,</i>
<i>it would bother me my whole life.</i>

42:58.080 --> 42:59.160
<i>What a start.</i>

42:59.240 --> 43:00.640
<i>I hope he's okay.</i>

43:03.480 --> 43:06.000
<i>Holy shit. I can play.</i>

43:10.760 --> 43:12.880
First game. Fritz.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.120
<i>The way I feel right now,</i>
<i>I need to go for this.</i>

43:17.240 --> 43:19.640
<i>Fantastic start for the American.</i>

43:19.720 --> 43:21.480
Good point there.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.080
<i>I'm playing Rafa.</i>
<i>I'm beating Rafa.</i>

43:28.720 --> 43:30.400
<i>I have to stay in the moment.</i>

43:30.480 --> 43:31.840
<i>I've got to fight it off.</i>

43:42.760 --> 43:45.160
-Come on!
-Game. Set. Fritz.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.360
Good job, Taylor.

43:49.440 --> 43:52.680
<i>The twist</i>
<i>to this opening set is a set away</i>

43:52.760 --> 43:54.560
<i>from becoming the Indian Wells champion.</i>

43:54.640 --> 43:57.120
<i>I feel like I'm super close to winning.</i>

43:57.200 --> 43:58.840
Here we go. Come on.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.080
<i>For someone like Rafa</i>
<i>who is known to just come back</i>

44:04.160 --> 44:05.840
<i>from these crazy matches.</i>

44:07.560 --> 44:09.640
<i>He wins matches from a set down.</i>

44:14.680 --> 44:16.240
<i>Brilliant from Nadal.</i>

44:17.640 --> 44:19.840
<i>Amazing how Fritz got there.</i>

44:20.800 --> 44:22.720
How long do numbing shots last?

44:23.520 --> 44:24.680
I don't know.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.040
The more sliding he does,
the more he could irritate it.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.120
Game. Nadal.

44:34.200 --> 44:38.080
<i>So, here we go.</i>
<i>Slightly different feel to this now.</i>

44:39.880 --> 44:43.040
<i>Incredible reactions from Taylor Fritz.</i>

44:43.120 --> 44:45.040
<i>How did he win that point?</i>

44:45.120 --> 44:46.240
<i>This is your match.</i>

44:47.160 --> 44:48.560
<i>You can win.</i>

44:54.920 --> 44:58.840
<i>What a response!</i>
<i>Fritz threw everything at Nadal.</i>

44:58.920 --> 45:00.520
<i>He's still found a way.</i>

45:01.640 --> 45:05.720
<i>It's Rafa. I've got to accept</i>
<i>he's going to win some crazy Rafa points.</i>

45:22.720 --> 45:26.080
Game. Nadal. Second set. Tie break.

45:26.160 --> 45:29.040
<i>A tie break to settle the second set.</i>

45:29.120 --> 45:30.840
<i>The first two of seven.</i>

45:43.200 --> 45:44.760
<i>It's going to be a dog fight.</i>

45:49.680 --> 45:52.880
<i>Levels things up</i>
<i>in this second set break up.</i>

45:58.560 --> 46:00.080
<i>What a tie break this is.</i>

46:02.960 --> 46:06.560
<i>Brilliant. He's got himself back in front.</i>

46:10.520 --> 46:12.040
<i>Championship point.</i>

46:22.920 --> 46:24.320
<i>Championship point.</i>

46:24.960 --> 46:28.160
<i>He's against the wind, so it's not</i>
<i>going to come super-fast at me.</i>

46:28.240 --> 46:31.400
<i>As long as I make my first serve,</i>
<i>he's going to play it a bit safer.</i>

46:31.480 --> 46:33.080
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

46:33.160 --> 46:36.800
<i>And I know that he knows that I'm nervous.</i>

46:37.360 --> 46:39.800
<i>Maybe I can break the pattern</i>
<i>of what I'm doing.</i>

46:40.440 --> 46:43.000
<i>Go for the shot</i>
<i>that he's going to expect least.</i>

46:45.400 --> 46:46.400
<i>Go.</i>

47:00.360 --> 47:03.360
<i>Taylor Fritz is the king in California.</i>

47:04.640 --> 47:09.080
<i>He wins his very first</i>
