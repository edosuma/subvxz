<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.836 --> 00:03.962
Stack!

00:03.962 --> 00:06.506
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Stay with me, okay?

00:06.631 --> 00:09.217
- How you doing?
- Not so good. Look at him.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.553
He's half a man.

00:11.720 --> 00:15.473
Mr. Reilly. You might want to get
a little Alzheimer's of your own.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.392
- Excuse me?
- Jeannie's happy here.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.477
Now you have to be happy too.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.479
You telling me, forget about my wife?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.315
Survivor's guilt.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.860
You're like the
second person, like,

00:27.652 --> 00:30.363
recently that's mentioned that to me.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.032
- How's it with Natalie?
- I don't know, man.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.701
I think she might have another guy
she's living with on the hook.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.411
This is my big brother, Rich.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.204
Rich, this is Franco.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.372
How's it going?

00:39.497 --> 00:42.042
If you want to run,
do it now and get it over with.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.544
No, sweetheart, not me. I'm sticking.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.047
This is a transfer. What is this, a joke?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.257
You work all day with a guy,
you think you know him.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.051
There's more about Mike
that you don't know.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.135
Oh, yeah, like what?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.678
He's playing for the other team, dude.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.306
- Mike's gay.
- Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.185
Oh, you mean gay gay.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.644
I got this cousin down in Florida.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.521
He's got this fishing boat. Charter boat.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.939
Makes a whole boat load of money.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.901
Got a first mate, the guy got married,
he's not coming back.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.904
He asked me if I was interested,
I said no. Now I'm thinking yes.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.655
I think the crew might be breaking up.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.782
- What?
- Yeah.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.784
That's why I'm here, Mr. Gavin,

01:15.784 --> 01:18.661
to ask you, most sincerely, for...

01:19.537 --> 01:21.331
for your daughter Maggie's
hand in marriage.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.874
Are you retarded?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.084
Let me help you.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.670
I can do that. I can make a better life
for the both of us.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.590
I have all that widow money
just sitting in the bank.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.343
All I have to do is call the bank,

01:33.885 --> 01:38.848
and the next day, I would have
a check for $3.1 million.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.767
I didn't want you finding out
from somebody else.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.144
Janet's pregnant.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.022
Congratulations.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.751
Stack?

02:14.551 --> 02:15.760
Stack?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.265
Listen to me.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.308
Think about the cabin.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.187
Up at the cabin with Deb and the kids.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.235
What?

02:38.867 --> 02:39.951
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.620
Hey. How's he doing? Hello.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.913
- How are you?
- How is he?

02:43.913 --> 02:45.498
- He's good. He's good.
- Good.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.001
- Here, I brought you some coffee.
- Let me give you a hand.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.003
- Thank you.
- How are the kids doing?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.797
I don't want them to see him like this.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.883
You know, the older ones,
they're gonna get upset.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.761
The younger ones, I don't know
the mental damage it's gonna do.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.763
- You know I'm right, right?
- Yes.

03:00.763 --> 03:04.517
The Yankees, they beat Boston last night,
and the boys, they were all excited.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.646
Like I could really give a shit.
It reminded me of him, you know.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.982
- Yeah.
- How much he hates the Red Sox.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.361
When they came back and won that four
and then they won that world series.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.988
- Remember?
- Yeah.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.115
Such a softie.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.951
He rooted for the Red Sox
in that world series

03:21.951 --> 03:23.494
because he felt bad for the fans.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.538
You know, for all the years they lost.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.706
Right.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.834
Oh... that's what I love about him.

03:31.044 --> 03:36.758
He had this, um, this survival thing.
This, uh... this guilt.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.468
You heard of it?

03:39.469 --> 03:41.596
A couple guys in...

03:43.431 --> 03:45.934
the firehouse were talking about it, yeah.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.019
Yeah? Oh, that's better.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.731
Go. You look exhausted.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.275
- You sure? 'Cause...
- Yeah. Really.

03:54.275 --> 03:55.735
My sister's coming.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.404
His mom and dad.
I'm gonna be fine. Really, go.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.073
'Cause I can stay until they get...

04:00.073 --> 04:01.866
It's fine. Thank you.

04:01.866 --> 04:05.954
Honestly, you have been amazing.
You've been a rock through all this.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.038
Thank you.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.709
Really, thank you for taking,
taking time off from your kids

04:11.709 --> 04:13.169
and your family. Thank you.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.505
Just doing what he would've done for me.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.257
You are amazing. Thank you.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.217
And please tell Janet I said

04:19.217 --> 04:21.844
I really appreciate
her letting you do this for us.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.388
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.098
All right, see you.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.391
Bye.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.571
- Hello?
- Hey. I, uh...

04:41.990 --> 04:43.241
I gotta see you.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.909
<i>For what? You already know the news.</i>

04:47.036 --> 04:48.788
I want to see you face to face, okay?

04:49.205 --> 04:51.666
You owe me that, at least,
don't you think?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.626
It's not gonna change anything.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.795
Okay, I need to...

04:56.170 --> 04:57.338
<i>To what?</i>

04:57.338 --> 05:02.051
I want to set up some rules. Figure out
how we're gonna explain everything to...

05:02.385 --> 05:05.680
everybody. Including him, okay?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.390
I mean...

05:07.807 --> 05:10.810
This family's screwed up, and now
it's about to get more screwed up.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.938
I think you and I should have
our stories straight, don't you think?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.732
Okay. When?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.611
How about tomorrow. Like 6:00?

05:20.903 --> 05:24.157
He gets home at 6:30. Do not be late.

05:33.791 --> 05:37.045
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:40.340
<i>With these ropes I tied
Can we do no wrong?</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:43.551
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

05:43.551 --> 05:46.721
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

05:46.721 --> 05:49.891
<i>With my teeth locked down
I could see the blood</i>

05:49.891 --> 05:53.353
<i>Of a thousand men who have come and gone</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:56.439
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

05:56.439 --> 05:59.609
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:02.779
<i>-Is it safe to say?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:02.779 --> 06:06.115
<i>-Was it right to leave?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:06.115 --> 06:09.369
<i>- Will I ever learn?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:09.369 --> 06:12.789
<i>C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:21.881 --> 06:23.216
What are you doing?

06:23.758 --> 06:27.136
Well, I know this is your regular schedule
nowadays, and I didn't wanna

06:27.136 --> 06:29.055
go up and see Stack or Deb.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.183
I just wouldn't know what to say
to either one of them, so...

06:32.183 --> 06:34.769
Yeah. Brutal up there.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.020
I know.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.939
What's this?

06:37.939 --> 06:41.818
Oh, well, so Damien has been after me
to get him a car 'cause, you know,

06:41.818 --> 06:43.653
he wants a ride, he wants his freedom,

06:43.653 --> 06:45.363
and so, I came up with this.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.116
You need some cheering up,
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him

06:48.116 --> 06:50.952
bash around town
in a brand-new vehicle. So,

06:50.952 --> 06:53.454
I will trade you this
for that piece of shit,

06:53.454 --> 06:55.790
and he can do whatever
the hell he wants to with it.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.375
This is mine.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.211
It's a Cadillac. Take it.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.922
- Take it, take it, take it, take it.
- I smell a rat.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.299
No, no, no. No rat. No rat. No.

07:05.299 --> 07:09.178
Yeah. This has nothing whatsoever
to do with what we talked about before?

07:09.178 --> 07:10.513
You can take the truck.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.349
And believe me, if you decide

07:13.349 --> 07:15.351
that you don't want to
run away with me and

07:15.726 --> 07:19.522
retire and go get a house by the beach
and all that junk, then it's okay.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.108
It's really okay. You can keep
the truck. Yay!

07:28.948 --> 07:31.868
Oh, well... it's nice.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.870
- It's fully loaded.
- Yeah.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.205
- It's a Cadillac.
- It's a pick-up truck.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.584
And you know, you giving him
something like this,

07:39.584 --> 07:41.961
that's sending completely
the wrong message.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.214
Right. Not to mention totally dangerous.
It's got a V-10 in it.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.133
That's a... deathtrap.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.885
- For a teenager.
- I know.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.969
Oh, yeah.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.304
Let me see a minute.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.349
- It's big, huh?
- Yeah.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.893
Big shit.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.853
It smells pretty, right?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.521
It still has the paper stuff on the floor.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.647
I know.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.691
Let's see what it sounds like.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.321
No, wait, wait. Don't you wanna
have a breaky or something?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.530
I can't, sweetheart. I'm late.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.282
- All right, okay.
- All right.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.451
- Yey. See you.
- Bye. See you.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.334
He's retarded?

08:21.876 --> 08:22.960
Kind of.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.672
Well, like, <i>Rain Man</i> retarded, or,
you know, Paris Hilton retarded?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.674
He's functional, all right, like Paris.

08:28.674 --> 08:32.053
He can go to the bathroom on his own,
which I'm assuming Paris can do.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.679
He's pretty good with numbers.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.225
I'm not saying the guy can count
toothpicks off the floor or anything.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.810
But, you know, then he eats things.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.230
Well, hey, hey, now.
There's nothing retarded about that.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.399
No, I'm not talking about food things,
Lou, I'm talking about actual things.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.151
All right, shit that's laying
around the room.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.488
Checkers, paper clips. Erasers, pen caps.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.573
Guy's lower intestine
must have a steel lining.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.408
You know how they
talk about retards having,

08:54.408 --> 08:55.743
what is it called, retard strength?

08:55.743 --> 08:57.453
What are you looking at me for?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.039
You know, maybe that's what
Richie the retard has.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.625
He's got all of his powers
concentrated in his digestive tract.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.461
The thing is, I really wanna
make a good impression with Nat.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.171
I was thinking I'd take him
to a ball game.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.881
Oh, yeah. That's a nice gesture.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.841
Give you a chance to bond.
That would be a good idea.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.843
Should work out real nice.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.596
Assuming, he doesn't eat the tickets
before you reach the gate.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.793
Not today, asshole.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.256
- It's incredible.
- Is it an Escalade?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.799
It's an Escalade pick-up.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.634
Cadillac goes white trash.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.261
- What?
- Nothing. How'd you get it?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.512
I decided to treat myself.

09:56.512 --> 09:59.932
Listen, it came with everything. It came
with a V-10, which is unheard of.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.642
They only made like
2,000 of those this year.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.603
It came with bucket seats,
it came with AC.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.354
Did it come with a chauffeur?

10:05.479 --> 10:06.731
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.316
God damn it! That's my truck!

10:08.858 --> 10:09.942
Hey!

10:10.401 --> 10:11.485
Shit!

10:15.406 --> 10:17.241
Well, it looks awfully nice from the back.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.870
Okay, yeah. Great. Thank you.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.706
Cops are on the case.
What's the city coming to?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.166
Twelve minutes, I owned that vehicle.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.543
Need I remind you how far
uptown our house is located.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.421
Nice to know you haven't lost touch
with your inner racist, Lou.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.298
Franco, I'm just stating
a geographical fact.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.508
I gave my other piece of shit to Damien.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.636
So it's gonna be at least three days

10:36.636 --> 10:38.763
before the cops find the Escalade,
or what's left of it.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.681
You're worried about
getting to work, take the bus.

10:40.806 --> 10:41.807
Yeah, the subway.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.434
Yeah, take the subway. I live in Brooklyn.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.144
I can't be stuck on the train
for 45 minutes

10:45.144 --> 10:47.938
in between Dom DeLuise and Ruben Studdard.
I'll take a hostage.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.899
Wait, Ruben Studdard,
that's the gay guy, right?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.777
No, no, no. Ruben Studdard
was the fat guy. Clay Aiken's the fag.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.945
Clay Aiken ain't a fag.
He's just not talented.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.281
- I should know, I voted for the guy.
- Guys.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.283
Mike, they didn't
mean anything by it.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.202
Sorry, Mike. I forgot you were gay.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.746
You know, I just got finished
being ragged on for being the probie,

11:03.746 --> 11:05.039
now I got to deal with this shit.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.083
It sucks.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.461
Did he just wink at me?

11:10.795 --> 11:13.464
Daddy knows what
his dirty little girl likes.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.758
- Right, baby, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.427
Yeah honey, your dirty, little girl.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.137
God, those drapes are awful.

11:20.262 --> 11:24.266
Hey, hey, hey. Get your game face on.
We only got 20 minutes.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.019
This room is so drab.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.400
I wonder if they'd let me spruce this up
a little bit, you know?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.402
Hey, hello. Hey.

11:35.361 --> 11:40.199
- Flowers, I don't know, burn some sage.
- Jesus Christ.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.868
I think it would help the mood.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.830
Sweetheart, check the hardware.
The mood's never been better.

11:45.955 --> 11:50.126
I mean, look at this place. I'm serious.
This is depressing, Theodore.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.420
I guess you're right.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.674
God damn it, probie. How about knocking.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.135
Here's my transfer form, chief.
I want out.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.012
From what I hear, you're already out.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.224
Thanks for the insurance policy,
now put my transfer through,

12:05.224 --> 12:07.768
or I dial up my union rep
and tell him what you just said.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.946
Hey, Nat. Are you doing okay?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.282
I am now. You?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.700
I miss you.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.785
You're sweet.

12:24.785 --> 12:28.456
Listen, Nat, I was thinking, if you need
to get a little work done tomorrow,

12:28.456 --> 12:30.332
I could maybe take Richard out.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.459
Watch him for a little bit.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.043
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.170
Take a sick day.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.130
Friend of mine's got box seats
at Yankee Stadium.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.716
That's so nice, but, um,

12:39.717 --> 12:42.678
Richard's kind of banned
from Yankee Stadium.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.763
Really?

12:43.763 --> 12:48.184
He's apparently the only one in New York
to ever toss racial slurs at Derek Jeter.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.229
Well, what about a, I don't know,
a tour of the firehouse?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.314
Richard might like that.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.065
Oh, he would love that.

12:55.065 --> 12:59.195
Uh, so, I don't know. Maybe I'll pick
him up tomorrow around lunchtime?

12:59.195 --> 13:00.946
That sounds great. I'll see you then.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.531
All right, sweetheart, bye.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.993
Hey, uh, chief. You wouldn't have
any problem with me bringing

13:05.993 --> 13:08.078
a retard to the house tomorrow, would you?

13:08.078 --> 13:10.873
We got two here as it is. I don't see how
another one would hurt.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.374
Thanks.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.960
Goddamn, it's 5:30.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.712
- Yeah.
- You're not going near Queens, are you?

13:16.712 --> 13:18.881
Nah, you know, I gotta go home. Study.

13:19.006 --> 13:22.593
- You're still... gonna take the exam?
- Oh, yeah.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.055
I thought that was all about Keela,
and now that she's gone, you'd, you know.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.681
Thanks for the reminder, Captain Obvious.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.142
You know what I'm saying.
Is it because of the money?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.727
Maybe I got my own reasons, Tommy.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.103
Like what? That's what I'm asking.

13:33.103 --> 13:35.064
Like this conversation for starters.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.149
- Frankie, that's not what...
- Yeah, yeah.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.275
Give you a lift?

13:38.567 --> 13:41.487
- Not on that goddamn deathtrap.
- Well, suit yourself.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.948
Hey, let me ask you something. You, uh...

13:45.157 --> 13:48.744
You still thinking about that thing
with your cousin, the boat thing?

13:48.744 --> 13:51.205
Yeah, yeah. I got a couple weeks
to let him know.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.624
Been thinking about making a trip
out there maybe next week or

13:53.624 --> 13:56.126
something like that. Check it out.
It's a pretty sweet deal.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.796
Look, you think I haven't thought
about things like that?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.256
I have. Many, many, many times.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.925
But then you think a little bit further,
and you realize, you know,

14:02.925 --> 14:06.178
we may walk amongst normal people.
We can't be out there with them full time.

14:06.178 --> 14:10.474
You know, we gotta be in firehouses.
That's where we're meant to be.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.686
And especially you and me,
our personal lives, man,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.479
it's all the family we got left.

14:15.479 --> 14:17.064
Probie's transferring.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
Call Dr. Phil. Maybe he can help.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.053
- Jackson Heights, please.
- Huh?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.263
Jackson Heights.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.650
Hey, pal, can you, uh...

15:02.276 --> 15:04.403
Can you speed it up, please, a little bit.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.325
Hey. You got...

15:11.035 --> 15:12.328
You can go here.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.122
Hello.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.046
Holy shit!

15:23.589 --> 15:24.840
Hey, you pay fare!

15:24.840 --> 15:26.592
- Move over. Move over.
- What're you doing?

15:26.592 --> 15:29.470
- What the hell?
- God damn it, move over.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.729
This guy up ahead, he stole my truck,
okay? I'll give you 50 bucks now, okay,

15:38.729 --> 15:42.274
and if I catch him,
I'll give you 75, all right?

15:55.496 --> 15:56.789
You son of a bitch!

15:59.458 --> 16:00.918
God damn it.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.461
Shit.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.758
So, uh, what are you?

16:08.258 --> 16:10.135
You a, uh, Muslim?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.096
Yeah.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.555
Uh-huh.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.893
So you believe in, in what,
like you die, and you

16:18.519 --> 16:22.356
go to heaven, and you get,
what, 77 virgins?

16:22.356 --> 16:24.858
- 72.
- 72. Right.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.069
I mean...

16:28.320 --> 16:31.615
What's the point of that, really,
when you think about it, I mean.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.743
Virgins? I mean, you think,
when you go to heaven,

16:34.868 --> 16:37.705
wouldn't you rather have,
you know, like, whores.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.125
You think there are whores in heaven?
There are no whores in heaven.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.752
I... you know, I would prefer,
if I went to heaven,

16:43.752 --> 16:46.171
- that I would get 77...
- 72.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.464
Okay, 72 whores.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.300
Chicks who know something.
Chicks who know how to blow you.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.761
- Know tricks.
- Let me ask you a question.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.973
- What?
- What are you, religion-wise?

16:56.181 --> 16:58.517
I'm nothing. I'm a lapsed Catholic,
but if I...

16:58.517 --> 17:01.103
Well, my friend,
you are going to hell, okay?

17:01.228 --> 17:04.648
- I'd rather go to hell with 77...
- 72!

17:04.648 --> 17:08.861
,,,2,000 whores! I've got 2-3,000 whores.

17:08.861 --> 17:14.408
And Babe Ruth, and John Lennon,
and Elvis Presley. Take me to hell. Jesus.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.326
Move!

17:24.710 --> 17:29.757
Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind waiting
like an extra 5-10 minutes?

17:32.634 --> 17:35.637
Yeah, good luck
with your virgins, asshole!

17:36.889 --> 17:40.392
I'm not even gonna ask.
Okay, let's get inside.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.769
He'll be here any minute.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.030
So?

17:55.866 --> 17:58.160
I don't even know where to start.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.745
Okay, I do.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.540
I had an abortion the last time
that you knocked me up,

18:03.665 --> 18:04.917
and I don't regret it.

18:05.709 --> 18:09.922
At the time, we were both
in the wrong place, but now, I want this.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.132
Whether it's his or yours.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.177
I want this child to replace what we lost.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.596
We?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.349
I was being kind.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.601
To replace what I lost.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.854
'Cause I'm doing this for me.
And for the girls.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.272
I think it'll help them heal.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.899
Especially if it's a boy.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.194
Actually, a boy would solve
a lot of problems for this family,

18:32.194 --> 18:33.278
don't you think?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.697
It's not like you have a shot.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.368
I mean, where are you gonna find
a co-conspirator, huh?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.912
You tell me. Who?

18:42.746 --> 18:45.374
Angie? Who?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.627
Look, you can freeze
all the sperm you want.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.630
You can jerk off into the goddamn freezer
for the next nine months

18:51.630 --> 18:54.258
and still not have
the extra added ingredient.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.803
A woman who wants to have your baby.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.140
Why didn't you listen to me?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.017
When?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.811
Six years ago.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.689
When I asked you
to spend more time with the kids.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.775
To spend more time at home,
to spend more time with me.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.026
Ok, wait, wait, wait.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.362
All you had to do was listen to me.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.115
All that was required
was for you to hear the words.

19:18.115 --> 19:21.326
I heard the words, okay?
I quit drinking, I quit my third job.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.995
I was home every Saturday.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.248
You were always playing softball
every Saturday during the summer

19:26.248 --> 19:27.833
and all winter, you played hockey.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.543
- All spring, all fall...
- That's not true.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.795
And the only reason that you quit drinking
was because

19:31.795 --> 19:33.714
Lou told you something the chief said.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.466
- That wasn't the only reason.
- Not because of me, not the kids.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.718
God damn you, Tommy.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.054
All you had to do was listen and none
of this would've happened. None of it!

19:41.054 --> 19:42.931
God damn it, stop!

19:45.058 --> 19:46.268
You're gonna tell me

19:46.643 --> 19:49.479
that simply because
I didn't listen well enough,

19:50.314 --> 19:56.695
that you then ruined my life
so far beyond what I could ever imagine.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.866
That's why, because
I didn't listen hard enough.

20:01.408 --> 20:05.495
That's why you're sucking
my brother's cock.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.334
God damn it.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.835
God damn it, Tommy.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.464
I was so lonely,
and I was scared shitless.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.051
- I had just buried my only son.
- So did I.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.928
What did you need, Tommy?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.472
God damn it.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.228
I needed you. The old you.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.773
And I needed someone to hold me
in my bed at night when I cry.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.151
I needed someone to help me.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.947
After I was done helping the girls
dry their goddamn tears.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.868
But the old you, he was gone.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.997
He's buried with
all of your lost brothers.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.874
And you know what?

20:50.874 --> 20:53.585
You can tell all your lost brothers
to go to hell.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.922
Because we're here, and they're not.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.219
Let her go, asshole.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.850
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

21:08.850 --> 21:09.977
- You all right?
- Yes.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.231
You ever lay a hand on her again,

21:14.690 --> 21:16.775
I swear to Christ, on our mother's grave,

21:16.775 --> 21:17.901
I will kill you.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.697
As I live and as I breathe,
Tommy. I will kill you.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.121
Wasn't what you thought.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.164
Get out of here, Tommy.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.708
God damn it, get out of here now.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.052
- You ok? Huh?
- Mmm-hmm

21:44.970 --> 21:45.971
I'm sorry.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.639
I'm sorry about that.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.316
I, uh, need to borrow
some money for a cab.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.610
15-20 bucks.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.992
You got anything, I'm a little short.

22:20.047 --> 22:23.425
A lot of your guys took their last ride
across that bridge that morning.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.010
Yeah.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.595
You gotta get out, brother.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.681
What do you mean?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.141
You know what I mean.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.853
Tommy, the moment you start having doubts

22:34.853 --> 22:36.646
about whether to stay in or not,

22:36.646 --> 22:39.107
or whether the new cocky-assed
sons of bitches behind you

22:39.107 --> 22:41.068
are incapable of watching your back.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.278
Tommy, that's the moment
you're gonna screw up.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.156
Kill yourself and maybe even
take some of them with you.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.950
- Right.
- Damn right.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.538
Just get out, Tommy.
Just take Sheila's deal.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.167
I thought you were against
the idea of me and her...

22:58.585 --> 23:01.213
being together. And, you know,
especially in this circumstance

23:01.213 --> 23:06.343
where she's talking about,
you know, a final kind of thing.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.471
She's talking about me
and her being together forever.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.431
- You understand that, right?
- I do. Yeah.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.559
And I was against it. Then.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.771
Tommy, this is now, man.
It's five years later.

23:19.398 --> 23:23.902
Things change. I've changed, all right.
I just want her happy.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.571
That would make me happy.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.074
Who are you talking to?

23:32.577 --> 23:34.704
Never mind who I'm talking to,
who are you talking to, huh?

23:35.455 --> 23:38.041
Huh? Just drive.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.293
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.588
You wouldn't believe the difference
in Jeannie from yesterday.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.508
I played her some reggae music.
She was very responsive.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.719
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Bob Marley & the Wailers.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.639
Wow. You know, we honeymooned in Negril.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.350
Spent every night in the reggae clubs.

23:55.350 --> 23:58.437
Drinking rum punches
and dancing up a storm.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.857
There's a great place in my neighborhood.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.608
I'll take you there if you like.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.196
Um, I'll let you know.

24:13.660 --> 24:17.038
Yeah, yeah. Go back
to your goddamn sleeper cell. Shut up.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.458
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.836
Hey, man, if they want to find
the next group of suicide bombers

24:22.836 --> 24:25.380
in this country, just bust
all the cab drivers in New York city.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.965
- Yeah.
- How you guys doing?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.758
- Good.
- Is Needles around?

24:28.758 --> 24:30.135
Needles?

24:30.802 --> 24:32.262
Uh, Chief Nelson.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.806
Oh, yes, sir. I'll get him for you, sir.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.061
Sir. Jesus.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.980
Hey, guys. How are you?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.068
<i>Battalion Four...</i>

25:01.791 --> 25:02.876
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.505
- You knew a bunch of these guys, right?
- Yeah. I did.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.592
Davey Smith. Ricky Daniels.

25:11.134 --> 25:16.264
Murph was in my class. Yeah.
Twelve years of catholic prison.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.559
He was an usher in Jimmy Keefe's wedding.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.521
- Hey, I miss Jimmy, man.
- Yeah.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.814
That guy was a firefighter's fire.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.068
Yeah, I know. I mean,
the guys you got now.

25:28.068 --> 25:31.446
Guys. Christ. The oldest one
in there now is 27.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.532
Can you believe this shit?

25:33.532 --> 25:36.535
When we were coming up,
you had to be, what, 55, 60 years old

25:36.535 --> 25:38.161
- before they made you chief.
- At least.

25:38.161 --> 25:41.540
Look at me. It's a different job, Tommy.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.584
- Yeah. It is.
- Different job.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.920
Speaking of which, uh...

25:47.254 --> 25:49.673
- I wanna talk to you a sec.
- About?

25:51.758 --> 25:53.343
I wanted to give you a...

25:53.468 --> 25:56.388
a heads up about, uh, my probie.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.139
Yeah, he called. He said he applied.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.475
It's a done deal.
I just gotta sign some papers.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.685
He's gay.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.271
What, like...

26:04.688 --> 26:08.400
Likes lotions-maybe a manicure
now and again-gay

26:08.400 --> 26:10.860
or actually blowing-other guys-gay?

26:10.860 --> 26:12.571
Blowing-other guys-gay.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.199
Perfect. All right, look, T,
this day and age,

26:16.199 --> 26:19.494
I can't justify saying no to a guy
based on the fact he likes cock.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.497
He goes to the union rep,
the next thing you know...

26:22.497 --> 26:24.165
I got you. I got you.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.795
He's also a coward.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.507
- I feel so guilty.
- I know, gay-wise...

26:32.507 --> 26:34.593
I used to work with Harry
over in Brooklyn...

26:34.593 --> 26:36.553
- Yeah.
- ...before he came out of the closet.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.638
That guy was the best firefighter
I ever saw.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.348
- That's what they say.
- He's a chief now.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.516
- I know.
- The guys are afraid

26:41.516 --> 26:43.727
to make gay jokes 'cause
they're afraid he'll beat them.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.811
And it's true.

26:44.811 --> 26:48.440
But a coward? Not in this house
or any other house.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.483
- It's up to you.
- All right. I'll spread the word.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.610
Okay. Thanks, pal.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.987
Is your house doing something special
for the fifth anniversary?

26:53.987 --> 26:56.197
I'm sure we are.
We just haven't figured it out yet.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.657
- All right. Let me know.
- All right.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.868
- Take care, brother.
- How is Harry anyways?

26:59.868 --> 27:00.952
Gorgeous.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.043
What can I get you?

27:51.127 --> 27:52.212
Um...

27:54.047 --> 27:55.090
Sir?

27:55.715 --> 27:57.676
It's, uh, Tom.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.345
Um, what's your high-end Irish whiskey?

28:01.137 --> 28:03.765
Midleton's, 25 bucks a shot.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.059
Give me eight fingers of that.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.228
Eight fingers?

28:11.398 --> 28:14.317
That's about 100 bucks worth
of whiskey there... Tom.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.403
Bring it on.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.922
Thanks.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.267
For a glass that's gonna cost
about a C-note,

28:47.267 --> 28:49.310
you're certainly drinking it
pretty fast there, pal.

28:49.561 --> 28:54.816
Yeah, you would, too, if you only had
about $2.75 in your pocket. Approximately.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.860
Give me the glass.
You better be bullshitting me.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.987
- I ain't bullshitting, pal.
- You lied, Tommy.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.656
- Come on, pal, it's just some booze.
- I'm calling the cops.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.950
Get off me. I'm FDNY. I'm FDNY.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.911
Bullshit. So prove it, huh? Prove it.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.210
See that? Huh?

29:15.336 --> 29:16.796
You like that, huh?

29:17.213 --> 29:20.091
See that? Huh? See that?

29:20.216 --> 29:24.554
I got that about 12 stories up.
Raging inferno up in Harlem.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.807
In the apartment looking around,
lost my helmet, I couldn't find it,

29:27.807 --> 29:30.101
but I found somebody's grandmother.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.228
I hand her out in a bucket to save her and

29:32.353 --> 29:34.063
punched my way through a window.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.066
She died about an hour later
at the hospital.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.819
Hey, uh...

29:39.819 --> 29:43.239
See that one? Look at that, huh? See?

29:43.239 --> 29:45.241
See that one? Huh?

29:45.366 --> 29:48.703
That was the drunken asshole in the Bronx.

29:48.703 --> 29:52.332
He fell asleep, while he was smoking
in bed. He started the fire.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.126
Woke up, he was trying to crawl out.
I got to bring him down,

29:55.126 --> 29:57.921
pried my mask off with him coming down
the stairs. The stairs give way,

29:57.921 --> 30:01.216
we go right through half a story,
onto these metal spikes.

30:01.925 --> 30:05.136
He lived. Four kids and their mom died.

30:05.970 --> 30:11.142
Yeah. Yeah, I knew 60 guys
who died on 9/11.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.730
And then what the funny part is, I betcha,
all the people in this bar,

30:15.730 --> 30:19.567
you could name five finalists
from <i>American Idol,</i>

30:19.567 --> 30:23.613
before they could name one,
one name of the 343 men

30:23.613 --> 30:26.866
who gave their lives
from the FDNY on 9/11.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.619
Huh? Anybody know a name?

30:29.744 --> 30:34.666
One name? Huh? Anybody know
a name? Of a dead fireman, huh?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.751
No, nobody. I didn't think so.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.090
I don't have any money because
my wallet and my badge

30:42.090 --> 30:44.759
were in my new truck
which got stolen this morning.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.512
My wife's pregnant. She's...

30:47.512 --> 30:49.514
She's gonna have a baby,
but we don't know whose it is

30:49.514 --> 30:51.975
'cause she's having sex with me
and my brother.

30:52.475 --> 30:55.186
My uncle's in the joint
'cause last year he shot my,

30:55.186 --> 30:58.982
uh, this drunk driver
who killed my only son,

30:58.982 --> 31:02.652
and I just saw my son
on a cross-town bus out

31:02.777 --> 31:05.780
in front of this place about
three minutes ago.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.339
Thanks.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.096
Sweetheart, believe me,

31:30.930 --> 31:34.559
this is way, way more bad boy
than you're ever gonna be able to handle.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.935
So do yourself a favor...

31:37.270 --> 31:38.354
What?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.065
Go blow a drummer.

32:04.881 --> 32:11.346
I was over at Needles Nelson's firehouse,
he's nearby, he's chief now. And...

32:12.764 --> 32:16.017
You know, they got that Murph plaque.
I had never seen it before,

32:16.017 --> 32:18.186
and I started thinking about...

32:19.312 --> 32:23.107
Timmy Higgins and Paddy Brown,
and all the guys, and...

32:24.609 --> 32:26.945
You know, then I thought
I saw Connor on this bus.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.947
- You think this honors them? Huh?
- What?

32:28.947 --> 32:32.492
You think this honors them,
Paddy, Timmy and the other 341?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.243
What did I tell you about
the survivor guilt?

32:34.243 --> 32:35.870
This shit's not going away, pal.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.830
It's not going away, shithead.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.624
You want a drink?

32:40.416 --> 32:42.126
Here, you want a drink?

32:42.418 --> 32:44.712
Drink it, drink it,
let's drink it. Come on.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.131
- You want it? Huh?
- Dude, don't do this, man.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.800
You want to drink it, huh, huh?

32:51.177 --> 32:54.222
Every time you do this, okay,
every time you come here and do this,

32:54.222 --> 32:56.975
it's gonna start all over again, okay?
It's just a poison.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.186
It's gonna start all over again.
It's a vicious cycle, pal.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.063
- You follow?
- Yeah, I follow.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.439
- Do you follow?
- I follow.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.692
All right, good.
Get yourself in the goddamn car.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.654
Put some goddamn coffee in you
and get you to a meeting

33:09.654 --> 33:11.823
so we can start this shit all over again.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.826
Jesus Christ.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.292
Uh-uh-uh, give me the lighter.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.920
I guarantee you, this is gonna taste
a whole lot better.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.011
You know, um...

33:33.386 --> 33:36.681
I'm really digging your sister. A lot.

33:37.181 --> 33:40.059
So it's really important to me
that we be pals, you know?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.437
Best friends forever...

33:43.604 --> 33:45.690
if you let me go down the fire pole.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.025
Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.485
My buddy over there tells me that
someone told them I was gay.

33:49.610 --> 33:51.446
- It wasn't me.
- It was someone from this house.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.822
Maybe it was your boyfriend.

33:52.822 --> 33:53.948
He's not my boyfriend.

33:53.948 --> 33:57.035
Sorry, sorry. Whatever. I meant, you know,
your suck buddy.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.206
Frank, you tell someone
from 74 truck that I was a fag?

34:02.373 --> 34:03.416
Uh, guys,

34:03.416 --> 34:05.251
this is Natalie's brother, Richard.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.711
Say hi, Richie.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.296
Hi, Richie.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.756
Unbelievable.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.759
Guys, come here for a second.

34:12.759 --> 34:13.926
What?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.848
I need you guys to be solid, ok.
Just look after him for a second.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.099
I gotta go make a phone call,

34:20.224 --> 34:22.977
make sure it's cool with Natalie
that he slides down the fire pole.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.606
- He's not dangerous, is he?
- Don't be a dipshit, Sean.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.067
No, he's not dangerous. Just, you know,
talk to him, make nice.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.694
Make sure he doesn't put anything
in his mouth except that sandwich.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.821
- All right.
- I'll be back, Rich.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.161
Hi

34:40.828 --> 34:43.581
So, Richie.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.750
You gay?

34:46.793 --> 34:47.960
No.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.379
He said you had a boyfriend.

34:51.756 --> 34:56.219
No. I... I had a roommate,
and, um, he used to...

34:56.928 --> 34:57.929
Blow you.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.642
Yeah.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.770
A little. Sometimes.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.563
But you're not gay.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.273
No. I'm not.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.067
Wow.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.612
And they call me a retard.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.997
That's funny.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.459
- What the hell, Sean?
- What, it was funny.

35:28.459 --> 35:32.046
- No, it wasn't. Now I know it was you.
- It wasn't me, what are you talking about?

35:32.046 --> 35:33.965
- You think this is a big joke?
- No. Come on.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.676
An actual retarded person says
that you're gay, I mean, come on.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.303
Wow. This is a really good peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.973
- It's a double decker, too.
- Hey, guys. Where's Richie?

35:43.182 --> 35:44.892
He was here a second ago.

35:44.892 --> 35:47.728
I don't care where he was a second ago,
Mikey. Where is he now?

35:49.230 --> 35:52.066
Huh? You know what?
You two are unbelievable.

35:52.066 --> 35:54.318
Can't even look after one of your own.
Thanks for nothing.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.904
Richard!

35:57.155 --> 35:59.073
Hey, Richie!

36:01.159 --> 36:02.535
Where you hiding, man?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.162
Richie Rich.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.292
Richie!

36:13.588 --> 36:16.382
Time's a-wasting.
We'll have to multi-task.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.803
I've got some candles,
some flowers, some music.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.014
How'd you get all this stuff in?

36:23.681 --> 36:25.975
Two bottles of French wine.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.852
Great. Let's knock some boots.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.397
You're gonna have to be patient, Theodore.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.901
Enjoy your chicken. I'm gonna
spruce this place up a little bit.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.666
Hello.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.960
This is he.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.630
Oh, that's great.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.465
Perfect.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.218
I will. Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:00.843 --> 37:04.430
That's the cops. They found the guy.
Drunk, passed out behind the wheel

37:04.430 --> 37:06.349
with the truck parked up
on riverside drive.

37:06.349 --> 37:10.853
Jesus Christ. Nobody knows
how to drink and drive anymore.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.440
Okay, these are my three favorite
in terms of table settings,

37:14.565 --> 37:17.610
but I'm kind of partial
to the cobalt gold band,

37:17.610 --> 37:19.070
you know, just 'cause it sounds cool.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.446
When is this happening anyway?

37:20.446 --> 37:24.033
Um, (CLEARS THROAT) we haven't really
discussed that yet, so...

37:24.033 --> 37:26.410
You know what, sooner the better.
One less thing to worry about.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.620
Okay. So how about sooner?

37:28.412 --> 37:29.580
Okay, like when?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.832
- Well, soon, really soon.
- Okay, where?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.085
Okay, well, how about, what if
we did it on the beach?

37:34.085 --> 37:36.379
- You know, it would be really beautiful.
- No.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.382
Okay, um... I got an idea.
Why don't we get scuba licenses,

37:39.382 --> 37:41.425
and we'll get married underwater.
That'll be so cool.

37:41.425 --> 37:43.469
But now you're being
a complete idiot, Sean.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.639
You know what, instead of
shooting down all my ideas,

37:46.639 --> 37:48.391
why don't you come up with your own ideas?

37:48.391 --> 37:49.809
Where would you like to get married?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.812
I don't care. How about, like, right here.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.190
- Here is a bar.
- Yes. But it's my bar.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.401
Okay, but don't you want to
get married someplace special?

37:58.401 --> 37:59.735
This is special to me.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.406
See, this is all about you and what
you want, and what you need.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.116
Do you ever consider my needs?

38:07.785 --> 38:09.620
Yeah, you're right. You're totally right.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.622
It's not about, you know,
family, or friends,

38:11.622 --> 38:14.125
it's just about you and me, right, so...

38:14.125 --> 38:17.378
You wanna get married in a bar room
or the back of a taxi

38:17.378 --> 38:19.797
or a friggin' rest stop, that's fine.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.757
Just tell me where
and I'll meet you, okay?

38:22.508 --> 38:25.845
God... I knew you'd come around.

38:27.638 --> 38:28.848
Here's to us.

38:28.848 --> 38:29.974
To romance.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.066
Hey, um, Nat. I, uh...

38:39.066 --> 38:40.234
Nigger!

38:40.234 --> 38:43.696
He's here? Oh, thank God.
Jesus, I thought I lost him.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.905
You did.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.949
The cops just dropped him off,
like 10 minutes ago.

38:46.949 --> 38:49.035
They found him wandering
the streets of Harlem.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.953
Not a good place to be
considering his outbursts.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.913
I know, look, I'm sorry,
but he's okay, right?

38:52.913 --> 38:55.374
- Yeah, he's fine.
- I just, I left him alone

38:55.374 --> 38:58.002
for like, two minutes with
a couple of the guys, and he slipped away.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.380
Richard has special needs, Franco.
You can't ask to spend time with him

39:01.380 --> 39:03.132
and then just pawn him off
on your buddies.

39:03.132 --> 39:06.093
I know, I wasn't doing that. I didn't want
to embarrass him by asking you

39:06.093 --> 39:07.887
about the fire pole
right in front of him, okay.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.555
We were doing very good for awhile there.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.682
- That's not what he says.
- What?

39:11.682 --> 39:14.602
He says you guys were making fun of him,
that you called him a retard.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.271
Nobody called him a retard.
That's ridiculous.

39:17.563 --> 39:18.606
Uh-huh.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.691
I'm not saying that
he's a liar, all right?

39:20.691 --> 39:22.443
He's probably just confused is all.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.695
I think you should go.

39:43.839 --> 39:47.426
Holy shit. I forgot what that music
does to me. It's like a drug.

39:47.426 --> 39:50.679
Gary, whoo, two more rums, please.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.558
Whoo.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.104
Listen, Jer,

39:58.354 --> 40:01.273
you can't let anyone
at my job know about this.

40:01.565 --> 40:02.608
I got it.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.777
I'm dead serious.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.530
First of all,
it's against the rules, obviously.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.825
Second of all, I'm an illegal.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.286
I'm under the table over there.

40:14.286 --> 40:18.290
Friend of mine set it up, and if I get in
any kind of trouble, so does she.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.877
The INS, we don't want them
sniffing around.

40:24.463 --> 40:27.883
Don't worry, sweetheart. Come on.
Let's get back on the dance floor.

40:27.883 --> 40:29.343
Oh, what you got, man.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.846
I got a lot, baby.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.100
Hey.

40:36.684 --> 40:37.685
What's going on?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.272
How's he doing?

40:41.981 --> 40:43.399
They want to take his hands.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.194
Shit.

40:48.529 --> 40:49.822
You're kidding me.

42:10.945 --> 42:12.029
Stack.

42:13.489 --> 42:14.532
Stack.

42:18.619 --> 42:19.620
Hey.

42:27.169 --> 42:29.046
Listen, man...

42:30.464 --> 42:33.759
You gotta let go, okay?

42:34.718 --> 42:36.637
I know you're a bull, everybody knows.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.181
You've always been a bull.

42:40.599 --> 42:43.644
Even when we were in probie school
together, man, you were...

42:44.436 --> 42:46.480
Me and my cousin Jimmy
thought we were gonna be

42:46.480 --> 42:48.107
the hotshots of that class.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.404
Kicked our ass in every part
of that physical exam.

42:53.404 --> 42:58.659
You brought that dummy down
seven flights in a goddamn flash.

42:59.493 --> 43:00.995
Son of a bitch.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.580
You gotta think of Deb.

43:04.498 --> 43:05.916
The kids, you know?

43:07.042 --> 43:09.837
Christ, she can't be wheeling
you around, man,

43:09.837 --> 43:11.380
and you don't want that.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.174
Spoon fed like a baby.

43:15.884 --> 43:17.219
I'll take care of Deb.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.139
And the kids. All five of them.

43:21.098 --> 43:22.266
Six, whatever.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.688
She'll meet somebody else.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.816
I'll make sure the guy's not a scumbag,
you know what I mean?

43:33.611 --> 43:36.196
You're not gonna win this fight.

43:36.322 --> 43:37.698
Stack, you're not.

43:38.657 --> 43:39.908
You gotta go.

43:41.076 --> 43:42.911
God damn it, you gotta go.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.452
Asystolic. Call a code and get a cart.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.960
<i>Code blue to burn ward.</i>

44:37.925 --> 44:40.636
- Start a line.
- Line in.

44:42.054 --> 44:43.305
Push epi.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.182
Pushing epi.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.769
I'm... I'm getting nothing.
