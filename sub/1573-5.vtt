<b>6x05 - "An Old Friend"</b>

00:22.349 --> 00:26.062
<i>As the war between the Republic
and the Separatists intensifies,</i>

00:26.103 --> 00:28.271
<i>many are driven
from their home planets,</i>

00:28.313 --> 00:32.067
<i>and it is up to Senator Amidala
to secure aid for them.</i>

00:32.109 --> 00:34.444
<i>All eyes turn
to the Banking Clan</i>

00:34.486 --> 00:36.697
<i>and the planet Scipio.</i>

00:36.739 --> 00:38.157
<i>In an effort
to remain independent</i>

00:38.199 --> 00:40.159
<i>from the Republic
and the Separatists,</i>

00:40.201 --> 00:42.078
<i>all operations are divided,</i>

00:42.119 --> 00:44.872
<i>and money transactions are
performed in a neutral zone</i>

00:44.914 --> 00:46.957
<i>surrounding the main vault.</i>

00:46.999 --> 00:48.751
<i>For operations to continue,</i>

00:48.792 --> 00:51.378
<i>there must be no war on Scipio.</i>

00:51.420 --> 00:53.172
<i>However, worry about the stability</i>

00:53.214 --> 00:56.217
<i>of the Banking Clan
is brewing within the Republic</i>

00:56.258 --> 00:59.970
<i>as the wellspring of money
may be in jeopardy.</i>

01:02.389 --> 01:04.766
Welcome to Scipio, Senator.

01:04.808 --> 01:06.435
If you will follow me,

01:06.476 --> 01:10.272
we will be traveling
into the neutral zone.

01:17.988 --> 01:21.075
<i>Va-tee, p'tee see-li
Senatee Amidala.</i>

01:26.205 --> 01:30.042
I am afraid your guards
will have to wait outside.

01:30.084 --> 01:33.754
Of course.

02:17.965 --> 02:20.301
As Council of Five,

02:20.342 --> 02:22.261
we are honored but surprised

02:22.303 --> 02:23.846
that you have traveled
all this way

02:23.887 --> 02:26.307
for a mere bank transfer.

02:26.348 --> 02:28.851
A transfer
that has not been forthcoming.

02:28.892 --> 02:31.187
By request
of the Supreme Chancellor,

02:31.228 --> 02:32.938
I am here
to expedite matters.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.481
Of course.

02:34.523 --> 02:36.025
We would merely request

02:36.066 --> 02:38.735
that you meet
with our special representative,

02:38.777 --> 02:43.448
who will go over the terms
and conditions of your loan.

02:51.414 --> 02:53.876
Senator Amidala.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.085
Clovis!

02:55.127 --> 02:57.462
You two know one another?

02:57.504 --> 03:00.381
Sir, I was assured
that this transaction

03:00.423 --> 03:02.968
would be free of prejudice
and partisan allegiance.

03:03.010 --> 03:07.014
This man is a known Separatist
and traitor to the Republic.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.307
Padmé.

03:08.349 --> 03:09.892
I can assure you

03:09.933 --> 03:13.394
Rush Clovis is our most trusted
and best negotiator.

03:13.436 --> 03:15.731
I am sorry, gentlemen,

03:15.772 --> 03:19.193
but I insist this man be removed
from these negotiations.

03:19.235 --> 03:23.864
Until then, we have
nothing further to discuss.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.597
My lady no longer requires
your assistance this evening.

03:48.638 --> 03:50.099
Thank you.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.772
My lady!
Watch out!

03:56.813 --> 03:59.775
I would stop right there
if I were you.

03:59.816 --> 04:03.237
How did you get a blaster
into the neutral zone?

04:03.279 --> 04:05.364
We're resourceful.

04:05.406 --> 04:08.533
Now, why are you breaking in
to my quarters?

04:08.575 --> 04:11.328
Padmé, you don't understand
what is going on here.

04:11.370 --> 04:12.871
I need your help.

04:12.913 --> 04:15.916
Last time you needed my help,
I ended up poisoned,

04:15.958 --> 04:17.041
and you did nothing.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.459
That's not true.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.503
You stole data files
from me.

04:20.545 --> 04:23.215
That revealed the location
of a Separatist droid factory

04:23.257 --> 04:25.008
sponsored by you!

04:25.050 --> 04:27.552
Look, it's not safe.

04:27.594 --> 04:29.138
We can't talk here.

04:33.016 --> 04:34.476
Senator,
I really don't think...

04:34.517 --> 04:35.894
It's all right.

04:35.936 --> 04:39.356
I want to hear
what he has to say.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.998
The simple fact is
the economics of this war

04:56.039 --> 04:57.249
are not adding up.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.875
You're here
for a bank transfer.

04:58.917 --> 05:02.087
But I can assure you,
there is no money in the bank.

05:02.129 --> 05:03.672
That's absurd.

05:03.713 --> 05:05.799
They were ready to give me
the funds today.

05:05.841 --> 05:09.386
Oh, they will give you
your first installment, yes,

05:09.428 --> 05:12.097
but they're robbing one side
to save the other.

05:12.139 --> 05:14.975
The entire Banking Clan
is on the verge of collapse.

05:15.017 --> 05:15.976
Collapse?

05:16.018 --> 05:17.436
Where's the evidence?

05:17.478 --> 05:18.854
In the vault.

05:18.895 --> 05:19.980
The accounts are sealed there,

05:20.022 --> 05:21.273
and no one is allowed
to see them

05:21.315 --> 05:22.941
besides the Core Five.

05:22.983 --> 05:24.985
Convenient.

05:32.117 --> 05:35.578
Well, now that you're here,
you must put pressure on them.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.123
And do what, exactly?

05:38.165 --> 05:40.583
Help me gain access
to the vault.

05:40.625 --> 05:44.545
You're insane to think
I would ever trust you.

05:44.587 --> 05:46.923
I'm sorry,
but I cannot help you.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.055
Take your hands off me!

05:55.140 --> 05:57.434
I've risked everything
to tell you this.

05:57.476 --> 05:59.520
Don't you see
they're trying to kill me

05:59.560 --> 06:00.979
because of what I know?

06:07.444 --> 06:09.071
Please believe me.

06:09.112 --> 06:11.323
Our past must count
for something.

06:11.365 --> 06:13.116
I can't stay here.

06:13.158 --> 06:15.035
Think about what I ask.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.102
If what you are saying
is true,

06:40.143 --> 06:42.896
then this information
Clovis is offering

06:42.938 --> 06:45.648
is vital to our security.

06:45.690 --> 06:49.194
I need you to be very clear
in this matter.

06:49.236 --> 06:51.530
For the Republic...

06:51.572 --> 06:53.532
Is he telling the truth?

06:53.574 --> 06:56.243
Yes, I am sure.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.661
Perhaps, then,
in this scenario,

06:58.703 --> 07:02.832
it would be best for you
to trust an old friend

07:02.874 --> 07:05.294
and do what he suggests.

07:26.773 --> 07:28.191
I've decided
to accept Clovis

07:28.233 --> 07:30.652
as the representative
of this transaction,

07:30.693 --> 07:32.362
as long as I can go
into the vault

07:32.404 --> 07:35.324
and accompany the funds
throughout the entire process.

07:35.365 --> 07:39.453
No outsider is ever allowed
into the vaults.

07:39.495 --> 07:42.372
I come with the authority
of the Supreme Chancellor.

07:42.414 --> 07:44.040
If you have
something to hide,

07:44.082 --> 07:46.209
then that is something
we should discuss.

07:46.251 --> 07:47.919
Hide?

07:47.961 --> 07:49.379
I think considering
last night's attack

07:49.421 --> 07:50.631
on the Senator,

07:50.672 --> 07:52.466
it is only fair
that we are transparent

07:52.508 --> 07:54.384
and agree to these terms.

07:54.426 --> 07:55.969
What harm
will come of it?

08:00.723 --> 08:03.519
The vault will be opened
first thing in the morning.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.438
Please make sure
you are here, Senator.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.667
Where, exactly are we,
Clovis?

08:26.708 --> 08:29.211
This is
my personal residence.

08:29.252 --> 08:32.839
A bit remote, but we'll have
more privacy here.

08:42.515 --> 08:45.768
Once I detonate the charge here
at the main power source,

08:45.810 --> 08:48.938
the vault will go
into immediate shutdown.

08:53.151 --> 08:55.195
No one will get in or out.

08:55.237 --> 08:56.905
This will give you
very little time

08:56.946 --> 09:01.243
before the emergency generator
cycles and takes over.

09:01.284 --> 09:03.412
You'll then use this to locate
the exact files

09:03.453 --> 09:07.790
and download them
from the mainframe.

09:07.832 --> 09:10.711
The vault is one of the most
secure in the galaxy,

09:10.752 --> 09:14.089
but it was designed
to keep people out.

09:14.130 --> 09:17.092
Once you're inside
and the power is down,

09:17.133 --> 09:18.885
there is little they can do.

09:25.183 --> 09:27.269
You make it sound so easy.

09:27.310 --> 09:30.939
If you don't mind, Senator,
I will retire for the night.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.774
Of course, Teckla.

09:32.815 --> 09:34.901
The information
we get tomorrow

09:34.943 --> 09:36.278
will go a long way
to expose

09:36.319 --> 09:38.488
perhaps the real criminals
behind this war.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.574
These are war profiteers.

09:40.616 --> 09:42.158
I've exposed that before.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.910
Nobody cares.

09:43.952 --> 09:47.914
Truth is not
on the battlefield.

09:49.832 --> 09:52.085
It's late.

09:52.127 --> 09:54.504
Good night, Clovis.

11:11.122 --> 11:14.875
Clovis,
where are you going?

11:14.917 --> 11:17.045
I have some business
to attend to.

11:17.086 --> 11:19.506
This was your idea.

11:19.548 --> 11:23.468
I should very much like for you
to await the Senator's return.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.316
If you will follow me.

11:38.358 --> 11:41.444
The credits for the Republic
are in this section.

12:38.585 --> 12:40.002
Uh!

12:49.095 --> 12:50.931
What happened to the lights?

12:51.013 --> 12:53.683
I can't see a thing!

12:53.725 --> 12:57.270
Find out what is going on,
and open the vault immediately.

12:57.312 --> 12:58.480
The power has been cut,

12:58.521 --> 13:00.315
and the security lock
has engaged.

13:00.356 --> 13:02.275
It will take some time
to switch over.

13:32.848 --> 13:34.390
Where is the Senator?

13:34.432 --> 13:36.184
We got separated
in the darkness.

13:36.225 --> 13:37.435
I'm here.

13:37.477 --> 13:39.813
No thanks
to your security system!

13:39.855 --> 13:41.940
This isn't a vault;
it's a tomb.

13:41.982 --> 13:42.983
What is going on?

13:43.023 --> 13:46.235
My deepest apologies, Senator.

13:46.277 --> 13:49.531
It seems I'm witness
to many firsts on Scipio.

13:49.572 --> 13:52.575
Is this an unfortunate incident
or a cover-up?

13:52.617 --> 13:55.578
I'm... I'm not sure
what you mean.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.455
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to report

13:57.497 --> 14:00.375
on your sad state of affairs
to the Chancellor.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.683
Let's see if you got
what we needed.

14:25.984 --> 14:29.111
As I said,
the vaults are empty.

14:29.153 --> 14:31.781
The Chancellor
must see this immediately.

14:35.243 --> 14:38.830
Senator Amidala, you are
under arrest for espionage.

14:38.872 --> 14:40.832
No, there's been
some kind of mistake.

14:40.874 --> 14:43.793
Take her away.

14:50.926 --> 14:52.594
I have powerful friends.

14:52.635 --> 14:54.136
The Chancellor
will hear about this.

15:13.489 --> 15:17.827
This way, Master Jedi.

15:19.412 --> 15:22.707
Ha ha ha.
Well, well, well.

15:22.749 --> 15:24.876
What exactly is
going on here?

15:24.918 --> 15:28.880
Ani, I'm so glad to see you.

15:28.922 --> 15:31.091
Ah, I guess
I'm not only useful

15:31.132 --> 15:32.842
for fighting wars after all.

15:32.884 --> 15:34.886
How long have I been
in here?

15:34.928 --> 15:36.596
A few days.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.264
They say Teckla is dead.

15:38.306 --> 15:39.599
Is it true?

15:39.641 --> 15:41.101
Yes.

15:41.142 --> 15:43.019
She was found shot
at the bomb site.

15:43.061 --> 15:44.186
By who?

15:44.228 --> 15:45.688
They don't know.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.857
The Muuns say she sabotaged
the power grid.

15:47.899 --> 15:49.776
What exactly is
going on here?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.778
You have to get me
out of here.

15:51.820 --> 15:52.779
Clovis has...

15:52.821 --> 15:54.864
Clovis?

15:54.906 --> 15:57.366
What exactly does Clovis
have to do with this?

15:57.408 --> 16:00.411
Ugh, I can't explain it here.

16:00.453 --> 16:03.414
How could you ever put
your trust in a man like Clovis

16:03.456 --> 16:04.624
after what he did?

16:04.666 --> 16:07.002
It's for the Republic, Anakin.

16:07.043 --> 16:09.921
Something is very wrong
with the banks.

16:09.963 --> 16:11.756
Why is it that
when Clovis is around,

16:11.798 --> 16:13.675
your excuse is always
that you're...

16:13.716 --> 16:16.970
"doing it for the Republic"?

16:17.012 --> 16:18.930
Anakin, please...

16:18.972 --> 16:21.683
You know, maybe I'll
just leave you here.

16:21.724 --> 16:23.434
Ani.

16:23.476 --> 16:25.436
You've already been released
into my custody.

16:25.478 --> 16:28.606
You better come with me
before I change my mind.

16:37.281 --> 16:39.534
Anakin, please trust me.

16:39.575 --> 16:40.952
I can't leave
without the files

16:40.994 --> 16:43.329
Clovis and I took
from the vault.

16:43.371 --> 16:45.874
Where exactly
do you suggest we look?

16:45.915 --> 16:47.792
The discs may be
outside the city

16:47.834 --> 16:50.086
at Clovis' private residence.

16:50.128 --> 16:53.840
Fine. I'll do this for
you, not for Clovis.

16:53.882 --> 16:54.883
Artoo...

16:56.342 --> 16:58.636
Have the ship ready
in case I need you.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.903
Over there.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.674
Huh!
Cozy place.

17:36.716 --> 17:38.760
Someone was looking
for the files.

17:38.801 --> 17:40.511
They must know
Clovis has them.

17:40.553 --> 17:42.722
Well, maybe they found
what they were looking for,

17:42.764 --> 17:44.306
and that's why he's missing.

17:44.348 --> 17:46.184
Ha!
We can only hope.

17:46.226 --> 17:48.394
Anakin,
you're not helping things.

17:48.436 --> 17:51.272
You don't seem to understand
how important these files are.

17:51.313 --> 17:52.815
They'll expose a corruption

17:52.857 --> 17:56.277
that goes to the very core
of the Banking Clan.

17:56.318 --> 17:58.196
Clovis!

17:58.238 --> 18:00.656
Padmé!

18:00.698 --> 18:02.075
I knew you'd come.

18:05.036 --> 18:06.204
You again?

18:06.246 --> 18:08.873
Yes, me again.

18:08.915 --> 18:11.667
All right, lover boy,
where's the disc?

18:11.709 --> 18:15.463
I'm not about to hand over
the information to some pilot.

18:15.504 --> 18:17.090
I'm a Jedi Knight
who can save your life

18:17.132 --> 18:18.758
<i>i f you hand over the files.</i>

18:18.800 --> 18:21.594
So what's it going to be?

18:21.636 --> 18:23.138
You going to give us the disc?

18:23.179 --> 18:25.807
What, so you can leave me
stranded like last time?

18:25.848 --> 18:28.309
Well, that depends on
how well-behaved you are.

18:28.350 --> 18:32.105
Can you both stop bickering,
so we can get out of here?

18:41.114 --> 18:42.282
Get down!

18:45.785 --> 18:46.995
Thanks.

18:47.036 --> 18:48.871
It wasn't you
I wanted to save.

18:48.913 --> 18:50.873
Anakin, get us out
of here.

18:50.915 --> 18:53.584
Follow me.

18:53.626 --> 18:55.753
Run for it!

19:28.203 --> 19:31.122
Artoo, bring the ship around,
and pick us up.

20:11.329 --> 20:13.039
Look out!

20:13.081 --> 20:15.250
Anakin!

20:24.133 --> 20:25.634
Did we lose him?

20:30.765 --> 20:31.766
Uh!

20:31.807 --> 20:33.059
I'm all right.

20:36.812 --> 20:39.274
Ahhh!

20:44.445 --> 20:46.281
Artoo.
Hone in on my signal.

20:46.322 --> 20:47.365
Artoo?

20:55.831 --> 20:57.250
Hey!
Nice catch!

21:15.851 --> 21:19.688
<i>Ah, gudtak Marrok.</i>

21:19.730 --> 21:22.733
<i>Que passkuna Bestiole-li!</i>

21:22.775 --> 21:27.071
It seems your mission
was a success, Bounty Hunter.

21:27.113 --> 21:31.409
From this point,
I will deal with them myself.
