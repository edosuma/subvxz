04:57.630 --> 05:00.716
Hey, Brad! Brad!

05:11.519 --> 05:13.463
He took our money.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.632
We... We just wanted a bottle of J.D.,

05:15.732 --> 05:17.383
and he said he'd go in and get it for us

05:17.483 --> 05:19.151
if we gave him the money.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.055
How much money? How much?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.823
$5. He bought himself a bottle of gin.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.065
Did you take their money?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.124
Yeah, I took $5.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.735
I was gonna give this to them,

05:35.835 --> 05:37.987
but they're smart-ass kids,
and now they're not getting it.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.614
So you'll give it back now?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.616
No, I'm not gonna give it back to them.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.201
You're not going
to give it back to them?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.495
No, I'm not,
because this kid's an asshole.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.538
- Which one?
- The big one.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.748
That's my brother.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.916
- That's your brother?
- Yeah.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.001
You ought to take care of him.
Besides, he's too young to drink.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.586
Give them their money back.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.047
I'm not giving them the money back.
What are you gonna do about it?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.507
Fuck you, and fuck them.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.720
That's what I thought.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.237
Brad!

06:11.788 --> 06:13.314
Do you?

06:13.414 --> 06:15.207
Get off the car, kid.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.613
You wanna play?

06:22.006 --> 06:23.465
All right. I can play.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.878
Come on, get off.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.396
All right, kid.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.717
You asked for it!

06:40.817 --> 06:42.510
Gas it. Come on.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.669
Get off, you nut case!

07:10.179 --> 07:12.889
All right, kid.
Come on, get off of the car.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.129
What do you want?

07:18.229 --> 07:19.729
The five.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.194
Now, get off the car, all right?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.435
Now what do you want?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.187
The gin.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.871
I gave you the five.

07:36.372 --> 07:40.709
Hey, man, you know,
we got your license plates.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.508
Now will you get off the car?

07:51.762 --> 07:53.680
You're weird, kid, you know that?

08:06.611 --> 08:08.805
Wow! That was fuckin' great, man!

08:08.905 --> 08:10.056
I liked it.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.808
Here. Take your gin.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.309
I'm taking the truck.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.868
Don't you want some of this?

08:15.953 --> 08:17.537
Come on, man.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.124
Nice move, man.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.700
Hi.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.259
Hello.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.386
This your friend?

08:35.222 --> 08:36.765
Yeah. Jill.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.669
Jill.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.294
Hi, Jill.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.812
Hi.

08:44.899 --> 08:45.982
You got a name?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.470
Brad.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.987
You don't sound so sure.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.247
Oh, I'm Terry.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.525
Terry.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.110
Hi.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.174
You have a really nice smile.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.595
Thanks.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.656
Terry doesn't take drugs.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.784
What are they?

09:38.494 --> 09:41.288
I don't really know,
but they make things stronger.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.165
What is that supposed to mean?

09:45.126 --> 09:48.461
Whatever you feel,
it makes you feel stronger.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.478
Brad!

10:06.314 --> 10:08.341
Just get her phone number and come on!

10:08.441 --> 10:10.485
Just get her phone number!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.221
Who's that?

10:13.321 --> 10:16.072
My brother and his partner.
I've got to drive 'em, I guess.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.121
Will I see you down here again?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.749
I don't know.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.296
Well, where will I see you?

10:31.922 --> 10:33.048
Um...

10:34.508 --> 10:38.803
Well, I guess I could be here,
like, day after tomorrow.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.889
All right.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.459
Well, I...

10:43.559 --> 10:45.143
I'll see you then.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.620
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.275
Bye.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.183
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, Bradford!

10:59.283 --> 11:01.394
Did you tell her your name was Bradford?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.062
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

11:03.162 --> 11:05.121
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

11:07.541 --> 11:09.527
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

11:09.627 --> 11:12.029
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

11:12.129 --> 11:13.922
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

11:23.474 --> 11:27.753
The Toyota SR5, the truck
that feels like a sports car.

11:27.853 --> 11:32.816
Oh-oh-oh, what a feeling to drive...
Toyota

11:35.444 --> 11:36.861
Hey, Brad?

11:38.447 --> 11:42.158
You're always trying to go out
with those real pretty women.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.079
All they got is a cunt.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.816
They're all the same.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.042
They tell you they want you to...

11:51.794 --> 11:54.087
To talk nice,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.033
and act nice...

11:57.133 --> 11:58.993
- Hello!
- Yeah, come on in.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.136
But all they got is a goddamn cunt.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.362
What you doing?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.240
The truck's all fucked up.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.869
Is she home?

12:26.328 --> 12:27.746
No.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.956
No.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.002
Now who's that?

12:41.343 --> 12:43.329
I want to give her some money.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.748
- Goddamn...
- Huh?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.958
I said, she could sure use it.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.809
So, what you think, $100?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.979
Two, three? What?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.011
Brad.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.388
Yeah.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.696
Tommy?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.226
No.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.534
Ah.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.330
See ya.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.546
How old are you now, anyway?

13:19.423 --> 13:21.007
Old enough.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.093
Damn.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.953
You know where he's living at?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.622
I don't care.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.420
He's over in Homeville.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.098
Oh, Brad...

14:12.059 --> 14:13.935
Don't even think about it.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.281
Oh, he's a brown cow.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.843
Is that my beer you're drinkin'?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.946
There's a Colt 45, you can't afford it.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.753
You know that shit you guys
are smokin' is gonna rot your brain.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.104
I guess in your case,
they're ain't no damage done, is it?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.403
- Why don't you get a job, boy?
- I tried that.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.114
Yeah, and you quit as soon as you paid off
that damn pick-up truck, didn't you?

16:05.214 --> 16:06.198
That's right.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.742
We ain't all got it
so lucky around here, you know?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.703
You see your mom in there,
she's got to work in the morning,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.789
your grandmom's got to work, but more
important, I gotta work tomorrow,

16:13.889 --> 16:14.999
and I need some sleep.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.143
You turn that damn thing on again,
and I'll beat the Jesus outta of ya.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.689
They're ain't no Jesus in me, Ernie.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.733
Go to bed, Tommy.

16:27.236 --> 16:31.015
Look, Ernie, this here's my house.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.350
We lived here four years,
before that Rising Sun,

16:33.450 --> 16:35.144
and six, before that, Jennersville.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.813
You've been five months with her,
you don't ever tell me what to do.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.231
- Ernie.
- Okay.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.774
You son-of-a...

16:40.874 --> 16:42.208
Ernie!

16:43.335 --> 16:45.112
I heard enough.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.671
You little fucker.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.203
Yeah, Homeville.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.637
Number for
Bradford Whitewood, Sr., please.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.479
Guess you must have heard about me
or something.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.508
I guess.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.317
What did you hear?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.488
I heard you was a thief.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.849
What did you think about that?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.201
Looks like you make
pretty good money at it.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.062
Well, to some folks,

18:00.162 --> 18:03.732
I'm just the devil in blue suede shoes.
Don't you believe it, okay?

18:03.832 --> 18:05.401
Okay.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.168
I never stole nothing.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.904
You hear?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.047
Yeah. Don't you worry about
getting a speeding ticket?

18:11.715 --> 18:13.993
Kid, you look
a thousand miles in any direction

18:14.093 --> 18:16.453
from Tennessee to Toronto.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.580
I go backroads just about anyplace.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.682
Never touch the interstate.
Never see one goddamn cop.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.060
Besides, this ain't fast!

18:31.860 --> 18:33.319
Hello!

18:36.365 --> 18:37.532
That's my son.

18:40.828 --> 18:41.911
It's Brad.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.541
He's staying with us... a few weeks.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.669
This is your uncle Dickie.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.907
Uncle Patch.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.617
Hi, kid.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.385
That's Boyd.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.122
Tony Pine.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.190
He's epileptic.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.895
They're sort of part of the family.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.066
And, uh, that's your stepmother.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.220
That's Mary Sue.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.904
Hi, Brad Jr.

19:17.781 --> 19:21.467
Mary Sue's about five years
older than you!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.078
You'll get along famous.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.581
We're late.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.294
Yep?

19:36.383 --> 19:37.675
Mary sue,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.120
show him that room we've got.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.289
Hell, he's cute.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.927
See you tomorrow.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.599
I didn't know you had a son, Brad.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.143
- He's got two.
- Sort of.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.978
Old Brad here went to prison,

20:05.078 --> 20:08.023
Julie started dickin' with some
grease monkey from Willerton.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.458
Nine months later, out pops Tommy.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.948
What exactly are you saying?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.866
Nothing.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.618
Nothing. I didn't say nothing.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.510
Just one thing here.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.555
Don't say nothing against the family.

20:25.807 --> 20:26.849
Okay.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.685
Let's go to work.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.066
So, uh... Where'd they go, anyway?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.207
One coming.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.589
Okay, I hear it.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.807
Patch, what's that car?

21:55.105 --> 21:56.439
Brad?

21:59.609 --> 22:00.802
- Brad?
- Yo.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.679
We lost our lookout.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.140
I think your brother's out there
pinching hubcaps or something.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.907
I'll stay where I can hear you.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.413
Hundreds?

22:28.513 --> 22:29.972
Twenties.

22:55.082 --> 22:57.708
You remind me of a guy
I knew in high school.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.739
Only he was a real dufus.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.704
Wanna go for a ride?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.012
Sure.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.000
Gimme that foot.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.544
- Gimme those little piggies.
- Honey, honey.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.111
Come do some laundry.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.287
Kid, you like pussy?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.580
Yeah.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.123
Smart boy.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.417
What's the sexiest thing
you've ever thought of in your whole...

23:55.517 --> 23:56.835
Excuse me, can I help you?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.086
Yeah, you got, uh...

23:58.186 --> 24:00.855
You got $5,500 on that car.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.399
I'll give you five.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.776
Cash.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.821
Do I drive her out?

24:39.895 --> 24:41.713
What are we doing here?

24:41.813 --> 24:43.647
Laundry.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.072
You know, that truck of mine
has gone punk dead?

24:52.949 --> 24:55.576
I could sure use a slick car sometime.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.521
Maybe.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.872
- Afternoon, sir.
- Yeah.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.750
I just bought this car.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.086
$5,500. It's a cherry.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.506
Could you give me $4,600 for her?

25:09.674 --> 25:10.784
Why you sellin' it?

25:10.884 --> 25:12.468
I don't like the radio.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.689
- You're kidding?
- No.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.568
Mom said, "That's my son.
Nobody touches my son."

25:44.668 --> 25:46.945
She threw his suitcase down the stairs.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.754
I wish I'd seen that.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.992
Brad?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.634
When are you gonna come home?

25:54.344 --> 25:55.370
I don't know.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.539
I'm hoping Dad might give me something.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.473
Yeah? What?

26:03.228 --> 26:05.172
Hey, Jill. Jill.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.939
Hey, Terry's friend.

27:43.828 --> 27:44.938
Hi.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.106
Hi.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.200
You scared the hell out of me.

27:48.897 --> 27:49.818
Sorry.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.710
Thanks for coming out.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.296
I can only stay a minute.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.908
Oh, well.

27:57.008 --> 28:00.245
Your friend Jill didn't know
if you wanted to come out at all.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.428
Jill.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.339
So, you do remember me, huh?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.841
Sure.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.010
You were supposed to meet me you know,
that night.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.528
I know. My mother wouldn't let me out.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.515
And...

28:20.615 --> 28:23.059
Then I tried to sneak out,
and she caught me.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.936
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.079
She grounded me for two weeks.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.526
She says until I'm 17
I can only go out...

28:31.626 --> 28:33.252
You're only 16?

28:34.212 --> 28:35.796
Yeah. So?

28:39.300 --> 28:41.301
I thought about your smile a lot.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.639
I thought about you, too.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.214
Jill says your last name's Whitewood.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.648
Yeah.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.611
Your father's got kind of a rep.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.723
Well, yeah.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.850
Don't believe everything you hear.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.435
Terry?

29:05.535 --> 29:07.161
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.981
- Um...
- Wait a minute.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.484
Jill didn't give me
your number or anything.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.403
555-6239.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.239
555-6239?

29:18.339 --> 29:19.741
Yeah. Okay.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.743
Hey, wait, don't go. Um...

29:21.843 --> 29:23.078
Terry?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.511
I gotta go.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.358
Bye.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.584
Hey, Patch, how come
you don't go out with them anymore?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.214
The other guys.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.536
'Cause your daddy's a dick face.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.304
Don't want me havin' no money.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.098
Don't want me havin' no fun.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.461
One day I'm gonna have my own empire.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.298
And I'm gonna steal everything.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.941
Want to help me?

30:19.692 --> 30:20.969
I don't know.

30:21.069 --> 30:22.846
Sure you can.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.192
You ever steal a police car?

30:26.699 --> 30:27.642
No.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.394
Me neither.

30:29.494 --> 30:33.064
Hey, we could steal
a whole lot of stuff, you and me.

30:33.164 --> 30:37.068
No sense sittin' around a dump
like this, wasting our time.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.236
I heard that.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.488
I mean, there's a world
out there waitin'!

30:40.588 --> 30:42.365
Tell you what,

30:42.465 --> 30:44.951
let's you and me

30:45.051 --> 30:46.677
go in the next room

30:47.428 --> 30:51.139
and start sniffin' some ideas.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.959
Let's go.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.434
Yeah.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.065
"Ideas" is my middle name.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.396
What do you think?

31:13.496 --> 31:15.231
It's fucking beautiful.

31:15.331 --> 31:17.124
It's a piece of shit, but it's yours.

31:19.627 --> 31:20.695
This legal?

31:20.795 --> 31:22.906
Yeah, it's legal.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.382
There's parts on it borrowed, but...

31:26.885 --> 31:29.283
Registration's clean.

31:30.096 --> 31:32.389
Don't never say I done nothing for you.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.100
Just don't know
if I could ever pay it back.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.902
Try this. Stay clear of my brother.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.597
Which one?

31:47.697 --> 31:49.656
You know damn well, boy.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.314
Okay. It's just a good way
for me to make some money.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.690
It's something I can do.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.151
You two jackasses,
you'll both end up in jail.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.986
Then, you teach me.
You show me what to do.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.155
If I'm gonna learn,
I should learn right, right? From you.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.797
I got no time.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.799
Just to show me?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.302
Don't seem right.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.513
Come on, Dad. I get some guys together.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.266
We'll see.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.856
You'd better go on home.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.651
To your Mother's.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.513
Here.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.739
I don't know why, but...

32:31.824 --> 32:33.951
You make Mary Sue awful skittish.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.056
- Five.
- I'm going to bed.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.558
10, 11, two, three.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.976
- Wait.
- Wait. Wait.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.160
- You've got... Mom.
- Julie, wait.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.481
Okay, she left. Hold on.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.816
Six, seven...

33:21.916 --> 33:24.084
- Six plus five is 11.
- Is 11.

33:24.627 --> 33:28.156
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

33:28.256 --> 33:31.633
nine, 10, 11... My property, no problem.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.261
Now we're gonna split her property up.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.248
I'll take boardwalk and park place,
and you can take...

33:37.348 --> 33:39.542
No. No, I want boardwalk.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.712
No, but... See, grandma,
if you take this property,

33:42.812 --> 33:46.507
you'll have a hotel on each
and there's better odds of landing on it.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.550
No, I want boardwalk.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.276
Cause there's three of them
and there's only...

33:57.326 --> 33:58.869
Big Brad, you know...

34:00.121 --> 34:03.775
When I married him
he had the biggest eyes you ever saw,

34:03.875 --> 34:06.376
and he courted me
like a regular gentlemen...

34:07.503 --> 34:09.670
With flowers and everything.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.592
Goodnight, little Brad.

34:14.510 --> 34:15.886
Good night.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.107
Hey, Brad,

34:29.984 --> 34:31.485
are you awake?

34:33.270 --> 34:35.554
There's a girl on the phone.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.594
I'd better get you home
before your mother starts to worry.

34:59.555 --> 35:00.748
Yeah.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.083
It's nice to meet you.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.459
Likewise.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.810
Good-bye.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.500
What's he like?

35:31.921 --> 35:33.213
Who?

36:23.848 --> 36:25.348
Found one there.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.936
Found one right there.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.481
Back in there, too.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.278
How can you tell?

36:39.280 --> 36:42.115
Size of the lawn, size of the stroke.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.660
Regular mower cuts about a foot wide.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.705
Good tractor do you three or four.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.502
See, most people that drive
through here, they see farms.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.757
Houses and fields and shit.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.135
I see money.
Everywhere I go, I see money.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.288
I see things that can move.

37:04.388 --> 37:07.041
Anything can move,
it's got my name written on it.

37:07.141 --> 37:11.033
Brad Whitewood,
please hold for delivery.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.438
My name, too.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.316
Yeah, little bastard.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.220
Oh, wait, I forgot.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.154
You's the bastard, ain't ya?

37:24.158 --> 37:25.200
Hey.

37:27.495 --> 37:31.039
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I swear I didn't mean nothin' by it.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.466
One day, you know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.012
Give you guys a present.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.402
What do you think of that?

38:02.530 --> 38:03.764
Looks like a pretty nice gun.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.642
Fuckin' A-plus, it's a nice gun.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.077
It's $350, retail.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.543
I got a good price on mine. Real good.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.112
Want to touch it?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.879
Can I? Is that all right?

38:27.596 --> 38:28.789
Like it?

38:28.889 --> 38:30.541
I like it a lot.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.559
You can't have it. It's mine.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.655
I've already given you a car.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.517
That don't mean nothing.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.519
I've gotta see something in you.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.605
I've gotta see you got something,

38:52.705 --> 38:54.122
right here

38:56.167 --> 38:57.751
between the legs.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.754
Then I'll give you a real present.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.299
You want to see we got something?

39:05.051 --> 39:06.702
We'll show you something.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.246
We'll show you something tonight.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.263
- Yeah?
- Hey, Brad!

39:12.975 --> 39:14.142
How's it going?

39:17.438 --> 39:18.631
These your new recruits?

39:18.731 --> 39:20.549
These are my sons, Lester.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.525
Oh, well.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.799
You boys have a very interesting family.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.475
Get out of my face, Lester.

39:29.575 --> 39:33.312
For instance,
remember when we stole those muskets

39:33.412 --> 39:35.523
from the revolutionary war museum?

39:35.623 --> 39:38.943
Of course, Dickie
conked out that janitor,

39:39.043 --> 39:41.696
making it grand larceny,
aggravated assault,

39:41.796 --> 39:43.630
but it was a good time, right, Brad?

39:47.468 --> 39:49.453
Oh, yeah. You're smart.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.706
You don't want to talk to me.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.124
Come on, Brad.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.875
I want to work with you again.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.961
I need some of that action.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.212
Why?

39:58.312 --> 39:59.672
So you can tell the cops?

40:01.357 --> 40:04.010
Cops ain't so bad. Just doing their job.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.053
Just kidding.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.560
Okay.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.061
I know.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.063
I'm going.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.414
I'm going.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.416
I'm gone.

40:23.462 --> 40:27.006
That boy ain't got
the life expectancy of a housefly.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.586
Like, this one time
Patch goes in this jewelry store, right?

41:20.686 --> 41:22.922
And he asks to see this $500 watch.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.715
So the lady,
she shows it to him, all right,

41:24.815 --> 41:26.300
but she don't want
to take her paws off it.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.136
He's tugging it one direction,
she's tugging the other direction,

41:29.236 --> 41:32.973
and finally, he pulls up his sleeve,
and he goes, "Lady,

41:33.073 --> 41:35.559
"mine's worth $1,000.
Why in the hell would I want yours?"

41:35.659 --> 41:37.269
This makes sense to her, right?

41:37.369 --> 41:39.480
So, she takes her hands off the thing,

41:39.580 --> 41:42.274
he grabs the son-of-a-bitch
and hightails it out of the store.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.176
Shit.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.545
Something comin'.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.185
Oh, what a feeling!

42:18.285 --> 42:20.146
Driving in style

42:20.246 --> 42:21.522
Oh, what a feeling!

42:21.622 --> 42:22.731
Mile to mile

42:22.831 --> 42:23.941
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

42:24.041 --> 42:25.401
What a feeling

42:25.901 --> 42:27.847
Toyota!

43:02.705 --> 43:03.939
Hurry up!

43:04.039 --> 43:05.790
We've got to stop before dawn.

43:06.709 --> 43:08.110
Yo, Brad!

43:08.210 --> 43:09.737
Yo! Telephone!

43:09.837 --> 43:11.739
- All right.
- The kiddy gang.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.909
Here, kiddy, kiddy, kiddy, kiddy!

43:15.009 --> 43:16.175
Hey!

43:22.683 --> 43:24.684
Make it spicy, Rose.

43:30.482 --> 43:31.967
Yo. What you got?

43:32.067 --> 43:33.511
Shot.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.678
Say it again.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.473
Shot. I got shot, man.
Birdshot in the face.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.974
Bad?

43:39.074 --> 43:40.742
Well, it hurts.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.537
Get any tractors?

43:45.247 --> 43:46.539
No.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.402
Go on home, then.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.837
I can't. Not with my face like this.

43:53.672 --> 43:56.424
You can't go to my place
if that's what you're asking.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.594
Mary Sue, me, we're here,
we're helping out late.

44:02.598 --> 44:03.973
Be at it all night.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.601
Can I come where you're at?

44:08.145 --> 44:09.687
You got a woman...

44:11.231 --> 44:12.940
...someplace.

44:54.900 --> 44:58.137
I want you both downstairs
with your clothes on in five minutes.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.779
Do you hear me, Terry?

45:41.572 --> 45:43.114
Whoo!

45:51.206 --> 45:53.541
Look at those two going at it!

47:27.052 --> 47:28.794
Sorry.

47:37.771 --> 47:39.146
Hey.

47:43.485 --> 47:44.944
Wake up.

47:56.123 --> 47:57.524
You know, I know my mom.

47:57.624 --> 48:00.126
She's not gonna sit there.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.672
She's going to call the cops after me.

48:13.974 --> 48:16.309
I mean, what are we gonna do?

48:19.062 --> 48:20.813
We got $18 left.

48:25.444 --> 48:28.237
I'm gonna have to go home.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.586
Listen.

48:47.799 --> 48:49.842
If we can sometime,

48:51.178 --> 48:53.512
you want to go somewhere,

48:54.139 --> 48:56.849
get our own place together?

48:59.394 --> 49:01.145
Okay.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.398
Mean it?

49:05.984 --> 49:07.526
Sure.

49:09.988 --> 49:12.281
- I mean it.
- Okay.

49:13.367 --> 49:16.202
It might take a little while,
but I can do it.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.997
Yeah, but...

49:20.832 --> 49:22.875
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.044
I worry about it.

49:30.467 --> 49:35.054
If you're thinking
you're too cool to boogie

49:37.766 --> 49:42.353
Boy oh boy, have I got news for you

49:45.482 --> 49:50.152
Everybody here tonight must boogie

49:51.154 --> 49:54.308
And right there, to my left,

49:54.408 --> 49:58.478
is the most beautiful woman
you guys ever seen in your life.

49:58.578 --> 50:01.106
- Mmm-hmm.
- Beautiful. She's a hooker.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.068
She wasn't a hooker.

50:05.168 --> 50:07.029
She was a...

50:07.129 --> 50:09.006
Architect.

50:10.924 --> 50:12.925
Some big firm in Philly.

50:21.935 --> 50:23.712
Except for the assholes and the faggots,

50:23.812 --> 50:25.839
I'm the richest son of a bitch
in this county.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.356
Mind if I sit down?

50:29.359 --> 50:32.346
I want you to taste something
'cause I saw you sitting there.

50:34.948 --> 50:36.115
Yeah.

50:37.284 --> 50:38.477
Private stock.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.687
There's no time to waste

50:40.787 --> 50:43.247
Let's get the show on the road

50:46.043 --> 50:48.278
- Were you here last week, hustling?
- No.

50:48.378 --> 50:49.529
I thought I saw you
sitting there last week.

50:49.629 --> 50:52.699
Whoa! Wait just a minute.
I need some I.D. on the lady.

50:52.799 --> 50:54.050
I shall return.

50:55.635 --> 50:57.621
- Come on, get out of here!
- Hey! That's my son!

50:57.721 --> 51:00.681
- Hell, Brad, I can't...
- Yeah, that's his girl. She's 23.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.673
Dad, this is Terry.

51:07.773 --> 51:08.981
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:10.150 --> 51:11.677
You treat my boy right.

51:11.777 --> 51:13.277
I will.

51:14.654 --> 51:15.847
I do.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.433
Come on sit down. Make yourself at home.

51:18.533 --> 51:21.895
Boogie no more

51:21.995 --> 51:26.566
You can't boogie no more

51:26.666 --> 51:29.502
You can't boogie no more

51:30.253 --> 51:31.670
- Terry?
- Yeah.

51:32.714 --> 51:34.006
That's Patch.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.468
Dickie.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.011
Boyd.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.180
Tony Pine. He's epileptic.

51:41.848 --> 51:43.417
What you drinkin'?

51:43.517 --> 51:44.876
I'm fine. Thanks.

51:44.976 --> 51:47.018
Hey, you're overage.

51:48.522 --> 51:49.688
She's 42.

51:50.982 --> 51:52.859
I'll have a rolling rock.

51:55.403 --> 51:57.180
I'll have a whiskey sour.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.057
- Whiskey sour?
- They're good.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.282
Yeah.

52:02.494 --> 52:04.703
We're real glad
to get to meet you, Terry.

52:05.205 --> 52:08.874
What do you think now that you
get to see us all in the flesh?

52:10.210 --> 52:11.418
I don't know.

52:12.504 --> 52:13.739
I've heard a lot about you.

52:13.839 --> 52:14.990
Nice things?

52:15.090 --> 52:16.950
You ain't done nothin' nice, Brad.

52:17.050 --> 52:18.884
I hope not.

52:21.179 --> 52:22.263
What did you hear?

52:23.390 --> 52:24.557
Different things.

52:27.727 --> 52:28.936
Dad?

52:29.646 --> 52:31.397
We wanna talk to you for a moment.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.350
I came here 'cause I wanted
to ask you about...

52:42.450 --> 52:44.895
You see, Terry and I,
we want to live together.

52:44.995 --> 52:48.372
We wanna get a place like that.
It's gonna cost some real money.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.792
So, I wanna join up with you guys.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.952
Just temporarily.

53:13.940 --> 53:15.467
Fine! Fine!

53:15.567 --> 53:17.969
You don't have to let him in,

53:18.069 --> 53:20.070
but you know, he's better than you.

53:41.968 --> 53:43.469
Would you excuse us?

53:45.305 --> 53:46.472
It's all right.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.857
That's not right.

53:58.526 --> 54:01.403
If you want to talk to me,
you talk to me in private.

54:02.405 --> 54:04.949
I'll tell you something.
That girl is trouble.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.727
She's nice, she's young, big mouth.

54:07.827 --> 54:11.565
You stick with us. You stick by me.
You can see this is a group.

54:11.665 --> 54:13.540
You know, you don't violate that.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.836
Take her home.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.631
Don't ever do that again.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.218
Okay? Don't worry about it. It's okay.

54:25.345 --> 54:26.804
And look,

54:30.141 --> 54:32.142
everything will work out fine.

54:33.853 --> 54:35.020
Yeah.

54:36.481 --> 54:37.856
Okay.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.235
Sorry.

54:58.044 --> 54:59.962
Go ahead. What else?

55:02.048 --> 55:05.092
Well, this group of guys,
whatever you call it

55:07.220 --> 55:08.622
goes all over the country, huh?

55:08.722 --> 55:09.805
Yeah.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.626
And it's organized?

55:12.726 --> 55:14.560
- Organized?
- Yeah.

55:16.479 --> 55:19.257
Enough. It's just guys, you know.

55:19.357 --> 55:22.302
I know guys and Tony pine knows some.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.721
Boyd, my brothers,
everybody knows some people.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.572
These people know people.

55:27.073 --> 55:28.365
Before you know it,

55:29.200 --> 55:31.561
you know everybody
you gotta know to get the job done.

55:31.661 --> 55:32.911
That's it.

55:35.165 --> 55:36.858
How do you keep the cops off your ass?

55:36.958 --> 55:40.502
I got a friend who reads
the police memos.

55:41.421 --> 55:43.990
For instance, they just got this report

55:44.090 --> 55:48.119
there's more tractors stolen in
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania...

55:48.219 --> 55:49.329
That's us.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.498
Than all the other 47 states together.

55:51.598 --> 55:53.807
Makes the cops around here kinda peppy,

55:55.101 --> 55:57.269
so we lay off tractors for a while.

55:58.688 --> 55:59.938
Anything else?

56:01.983 --> 56:05.486
- Why are you letting me ask you all this?
- Because you got to know.

56:06.112 --> 56:08.890
I gotta make sure you walk into this
with your eyes wide

56:08.990 --> 56:11.950
and know what you're doing
and who you're with.

56:13.953 --> 56:16.955
Especially, you know,
it's a family situation.

56:24.172 --> 56:26.199
You go out with us once or twice.

56:26.299 --> 56:29.176
See how it is, then you decide
if you still want it.

56:30.095 --> 56:32.221
'Cause if you do, that's it.

56:33.973 --> 56:36.266
It's blood. Don't break it.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.167
Dickie?

57:51.176 --> 57:52.843
The caretaker's light just went on.

57:53.928 --> 57:55.846
Okay, don't move at all! Don't move.

58:14.574 --> 58:15.809
Good.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.409
Good goin', kid.

58:21.789 --> 58:23.165
Bye-bye.

58:25.710 --> 58:27.044
Go, go, go!

58:28.254 --> 58:30.323
You know what? I've been thinking.

58:30.423 --> 58:32.575
I ought to sign up at the university.

58:32.675 --> 58:35.453
Hey, that's a real good idea, patch.
That's real swift.

58:35.553 --> 58:37.122
No, no, no, no, no.

58:37.222 --> 58:39.264
Take one of them art courses.

58:40.433 --> 58:42.210
We go into a joint like that,

58:42.310 --> 58:44.546
it must be trillions,

58:44.646 --> 58:46.798
hundreds of trillions of dollars
hanging on the wall.

58:46.898 --> 58:49.843
We're too dumb
to know which ones to take.

58:49.943 --> 58:51.302
Take the ugly ones.

58:51.402 --> 58:53.179
Uglier they are, more they're worth.

58:53.279 --> 58:54.446
That's right.

59:03.206 --> 59:04.691
What?

59:04.791 --> 59:06.234
You showed me somethin' tonight.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.126
- What?
- My own blood.

59:09.420 --> 59:10.754
Am I right?

59:14.467 --> 59:15.551
You're gonna make it.

59:16.261 --> 59:17.511
Heard that.

59:21.641 --> 59:22.724
Looky here.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.310
Good old Detective Mosker.

59:27.438 --> 59:28.855
They really got class.

59:33.611 --> 59:35.279
They're having hamburger steak.

59:40.660 --> 59:41.827
Hello.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.866
See you later.

01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:25.355
Oh, I know.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.206
Did you hear about that girl
who was eight before she was seven?

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.626
Oop.

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:33.211
I hate those short-eyes jokes.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.949
Look who waited up.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.534
Well,

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.452
I didn't want you getting
the wrong idea,

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.762
my sharing dinner with some fuckin' cop.

01:00:43.514 --> 01:00:45.599
We didn't get the wrong idea, Lester.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.086
We got the right idea.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.311
Yeah.

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:52.731
Want to go out?

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.717
Job?

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.469
- Right now?
- Okay, no...

01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:57.804
Don't say no.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.529
It's your chance to prove yourself.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:02.642
Come on, Lester.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.076
I know you're a good man.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.312
You catch up, Lester.

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:08.080
Come on, drink up, drink up.

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:11.833
That's more like it.

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.779
We're drunk as skunks.

01:01:14.879 --> 01:01:17.172
We want you to feel just as good.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:22.135
- That's more like it.
- Ah!

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.832
I have somethin'.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.417
You gettin' high? Drink it.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:28.850
- It's for you.
- I don't know.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.019
Eat this. Eat this.

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:34.674
What is it?

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:35.941
It's, um...

01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:39.495
Something to eat. Eat it.

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:43.683
What you been tellin' the cops, Lester?

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.117
Nothing.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.520
What you talkin' to Mosker about?

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.707
- The weather? Phillies?
- No. No! Just, uh...

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.694
I know you been talkin' about somethin'.

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:02.300
I'm scared.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.304
You can't be scared. You're a tough guy.

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:10.084
You used to be a member
of the Whitewood gang.

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:12.436
Yeah, I know,

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.229
but...

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.274
What'd you say?

01:02:17.942 --> 01:02:19.151
Speak up!

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.600
- Leave him alone.
- Well, I, uh...

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.560
- I sold him some information.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:30.229
Yeah, but it wasn't true information.
It was about Soleski.

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:33.039
- Oh. Oh, I hate him.
- Yeah. I know.

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:35.610
- I wouldn't hurt you, Brad. You know that.
- He's a fat pig.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:38.029
- I want to help you. I do.
- Yeah?

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.406
I was pumping him for information.
Stuff you guys can use.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.693
- Like...
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.703
I found out that, uh...

01:02:45.803 --> 01:02:47.846
- They brought the FBI here.
- Yeah?

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.416
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No shit!

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:55.129
And, uh, they got this
grand jury convened.

01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:56.422
About us?

01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:57.564
Sure.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.636
I'm telling you, who would tell you
this kind of stuff, Brad,

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.471
if it wasn't for me?

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.531
I don't know.
Guess you're just a real good friend.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.437
I don't feel too good. I drank too much.

01:03:11.537 --> 01:03:13.038
I better pull over.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.624
Pull over by this tree.

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.900
We're goin' down to the river?

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.486
Hey.

01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:49.115
I'm glad to be able to...

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.412
God, I can't walk.

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.737
Hey, hey!

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.295
Whoa!

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:06.716
- Feel that water, Les? It's good.
- Yeah.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.219
- Wake you right up.
- Whoo!

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.140
Hey, it's getting deeper.

01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:25.151
Get your face wet.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.680
Water on your face really wakes you up.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.516
Hey, I don't need your help.
No, I can do it alone!

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:32.534
Hey, no!

01:04:34.148 --> 01:04:36.236
Brad!

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.448
When we get this thing fixed up,

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.378
you'll be one cool dude. A real rumbler.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.377
I'm thinking of getting myself a job

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.464
fixing Chevys or something.

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.717
How much you make?

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.511
You can get like 10, 12 an hour.
It depends.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.209
That ain't that much.

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:40.352
Hey, it's a steady job.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.104
Nobody gets killed.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:48.860
Somebody got killed?

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.349
Brad, when you went out
with Dad and them,

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.059
did somebody get killed?

01:05:55.159 --> 01:05:56.451
Forget it.

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.834
- Brad!
- I said forget it, Tommy.

01:06:13.594 --> 01:06:15.454
- He's no good.
- What?

01:06:15.554 --> 01:06:16.805
They're no good.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.624
What are you talking about?

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:20.016
They're bad people.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.673
Hi, boys.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.148
Hi, Dad.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.313
What do you think of that?

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.330
- That's nice.
- I just got it.

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:45.542
You see, the thing is,
I'm gonna tell you...

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:48.920
I got some big business
over in Willerton.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.841
And I was wondering if you guys
could help me out with some of that...

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.427
Wacky-Tobacky.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.998
What do you say?

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.666
I got money.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.225
- Yeah.
- Hurry up.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:11.234
We're going out tonight.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.863
Be by around midnight.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:26.025
What's the damage? Twenty-five?

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.417
Forty.

01:07:28.335 --> 01:07:29.502
- Yeah?
- Forty.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.796
You a born thief.

01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:45.310
You're crazy. You know, you're crazy.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.426
Lookin' good!

01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:54.027
Julie Whitewood.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.696
Tired old bag of shit.

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:00.977
You like that car?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.728
You wanna sit in that car?

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:05.189
- Is it all right?
- Go on, sit in it.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.539
All right.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:14.380
I'm not going out tonight.

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:16.841
What?

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.094
I'm not gonna go out anymore.

01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:27.810
You want to live in a dump like this,

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.023
working 10 hours a day in a cannery?

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:34.442
I thought you were like me.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.278
I thought you wanted something.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:39.613
A car,

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:42.450
nice girl sitting in your lap.

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:44.536
Money in your pocket.

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.205
You said I could go out
and then decide, right?

01:08:48.249 --> 01:08:49.666
You scared?

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:51.944
I got something else.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:53.487
Something or somebody?

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.755
Yeah. Terry and I
are getting out of here.

01:08:57.758 --> 01:08:58.868
Where you gonna go?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.745
What are you gonna do
when you get where you go?

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.053
I got some ideas.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.684
How are you gonna pay?

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:13.131
Apartment, food, clothes. All that.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.439
I'll find something.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.803
You'll find shit!

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:20.029
All you know is how to steal.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:24.810
You're too fuckin' dumb
to do that by yourself!

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.604
Oh, you think so?

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:28.522
I know so!

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.318
You'll come back, crawlin' back to me,
"Daddy, daddy, give me somethin'."

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.752
- Well, we'll see. Yeah, we'll see.
- Yeah, we'll see.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:09:59.277
What's the matter?

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.119
Tell me about your uncle.

01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:11.039
Your uncle,

01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:14.125
will he really take us?

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:16.669
Sure.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.841
What's it like there?
What does it look like?

01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:31.684
It's called the Big Sky Country,

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.589
because the land goes on forever,

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:38.050
looking out 20 miles one way

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.984
and 50 in the other.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.265
And they got jobs there, too.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.725
My cousin's husband, Rollie,

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:48.352
he's got a job in billings.

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:51.287
And he's about as
dumb as a dog or something.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.709
You know what else they got?

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.489
My cousin,
she's just two years older than me

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.173
and she's got a baby.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.972
It's got little tiny feet
and little hands,

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.292
and it laughs already.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.670
It probably talks now.
But when I was there, it was just laughing.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.271
It was so tiny.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.029
I guess I love you, huh?

01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:45.508
So?

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:48.511
What do you think?

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.764
I don't know.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.100
It seems...

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:56.853
It's a little big.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.716
Who cares if it's a fucked-up idea, man?

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.551
If we get away with it,
we score big, right?

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.428
Okay, look, it's not a fucked-up idea.

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:07.655
All we have to do is get in
and out of there as fast as possible.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:13.369
Okay?

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.400
Okay.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.445
Ah! Come on! There's a car!

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:50.182
Shit! Somebody's coming.
Come on, let's go!

01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:51.725
Tommy, come on, help Tim
get these ramps.

01:12:51.825 --> 01:12:53.143
Get the crowbar!

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:55.688
- Where the fuck is it?
- Aggie! Come on!

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:57.246
Get a load of this, man.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:00.859
- Come on, a car!
- I got to have her!

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.043
Let's go!

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:09.133
- Come on!
- Isn't she's beautiful?

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:13.638
- Get in!
- Come on! Help me shut it!

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:21.312
Fuck it! Come on!

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.403
Now, I want you to climb down
from there very slowly.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:45.545
Fuck!

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.228
Okay. Bailed out.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:22.274
Essex, Milton, Smithson,

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:24.375
Whitewood, T.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.547
Go on.

01:14:43.795 --> 01:14:46.906
- I'll take 25-20.
- I'll lay you 25-20.

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.019
You gonna shut this down?

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:27.605
Maybe next week.

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:30.175
What do you want, Whitewood?

01:15:30.275 --> 01:15:32.700
I put 500 on that gray one.

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:34.278
That's a shrewd bet.

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:38.934
What's my son saying?

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.227
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:42.328
But they haven't really
started on him yet.

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:47.609
What about the FBI?

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.027
They really bring them in?

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.071
Mmm-hmm. Last month.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:52.698
- Grand jury?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.006
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.243
What they got?

01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:58.537
Well, not much so far.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:00.221
I'm sure they'll find something.

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.057
Maybe a body or two, hmm?

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.102
Uh...

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.397
Can I make a donation?

01:16:10.482 --> 01:16:12.301
- Political something, something?
- No.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.985
Not now. It's too hot.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:16.821
Oh.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:18.974
Your bird lost.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:20.491
So he did.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.235
Maybe next week
if they don't get anything more.

01:16:30.335 --> 01:16:31.904
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We'll see.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.755
If they do get more?

01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:02.074
Hi. Is Mr. whitewood here?
My name's Terry.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.578
It's okay.

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:14.837
Thanks.

01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:22.788
Um...

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.790
I was planning to go see Brad,

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:28.225
and, uh, his mother can't go
till the weekend 'cause she's working.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:31.896
So I was wondering
if you're planning to go.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:37.803
Hmm.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:39.028
Maybe.

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:41.739
Well...

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:46.369
If you do go,
um, do you mind if I go with you?

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.622
I don't see why not.

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.583
You done a lot for my boy.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.127
I hope so.

01:17:57.547 --> 01:17:59.006
You changed him.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.508
Thank you.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:04.762
You know what I don't get is why

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:09.350
they let everybody else out
and they set Brad's bail so high.

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:13.312
I don't get it.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:17.191
They figure,
if he's in there long enough,

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.568
we'll know what he's saying.

01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:22.154
About what?

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:41.424
You want some corn flakes?

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:45.136
No, thanks.

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.462
- You scared, kid?
- Of what?

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.146
Bunch of tractor thieves?

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.966
What do you owe those guys?

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.734
What did they ever do for you?

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.653
What did your father ever do for you?

01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.741
I don't talk against my family.

01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:14.540
Hello.

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:36.145
Uh, look, um...

01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:39.299
Do me a favor.

01:19:39.399 --> 01:19:41.859
That's 12,000 cash.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:44.262
Tell Brad that, uh...

01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:46.155
He don't want it.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.033
Let him decide.

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:51.827
I said he don't want it.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.900
Wow, that's a really nice cake.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.367
- Got a file in it?
- Yeah.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.381
I didn't... I didn't even know you...

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.577
I didn't know
you guys knew each other really.

01:20:07.677 --> 01:20:09.887
Lucas? Oh, yeah.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:15.460
Only one in the whole kiddy gang
knows his ass from a pitchfork.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.853
I'm kinda takin' him under my wing.

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:19.563
I see.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.096
How you doin'?

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:27.613
Nervous, I bet.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:30.308
I'm okay.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:32.644
Ever been inside a jail before?

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.938
No. No way.

01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:38.608
It's nasty. I'll tell you,
it gives me the jimmies every time.

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:45.089
Want some?

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.451
What is it? Bourbon?

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:48.994
This is rye.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.553
You're welcome to it, if you want.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:53.165
- Oh, yeah. I heard that...
- It's good stuff.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.541
It's not a bad idea.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:55.751
It's not a bad idea, really.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:57.461
Get a little juiced
before you get in there.

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.144
Get some system going.

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:07.611
See, the thing is,
it's gonna be worst of all on you.

01:21:08.337 --> 01:21:09.963
Why is that?

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:11.850
Being a girl.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.394
Being cute girl.

01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:17.898
Yeah. Being real cute, and being a girl.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:22.277
All them other convicts and the perverts
and such, be givin' you a real long look.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:25.906
Oh, they be lookin' at you all over.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:27.214
That's right.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.592
Convicts stare.

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.579
Aren't you gonna protect me?

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:35.222
- Can't. Not from their eyes.
- Sure.

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.349
Don't worry about it.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:43.314
Another sip of that,
you won't feel nothin'.

01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:46.150
Go on.

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:54.392
Well, just go on.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:56.019
That's good stuff, huh?

01:21:56.119 --> 01:21:57.562
Drink it.

01:21:57.662 --> 01:21:58.996
Yeah.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:15.580
I didn't move the cake.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.139
It's all right. Just leave it there.

01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:24.965
- Come on.
- What?

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.299
You touched me.

01:22:26.399 --> 01:22:27.566
Okay.

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.237
Come on.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.854
I want to go see Brad.
I don't want to go in there.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.871
Screw Brad.

01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:52.325
- What are you doing? Where's Lucas?
- My boy made a mistake.

01:22:52.425 --> 01:22:55.871
He let a woman rule his business.
That is a mistake.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.096
What do you mean?

01:22:58.598 --> 01:23:00.224
Where the fuck is...

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:04.937
I don't want to be
in this fucking place.

01:23:05.855 --> 01:23:07.132
You scared yet, hmm?

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.968
- Here, drink that down. You got that pill?
- What is this place?

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.304
Where is it? Where is it?
Let me see it. Right.

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.097
Drink it down.

01:23:14.197 --> 01:23:15.307
You scared yet?

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:16.850
Mmm.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:18.435
You ought to be.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:22.439
- I'm not scared of you.
- You scared yet? No?

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:24.316
Look, we gotta get something
straight now.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:27.652
No, no, you're not goin' anywhere.
We got to get something straight.

01:23:27.752 --> 01:23:29.461
You ain't gonna see my son.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.324
Okay?

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:33.757
You give me your word.

01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:37.219
I gotta hear it. I gotta believe it.

01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:40.832
I love Brad.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.000
Well, that's your mistake.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.418
I love him.

01:23:43.518 --> 01:23:45.837
That's a mistake. It's over. That's it.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.089
You know too much. You think too much.
You talk too much.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.841
That's it, okay?

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.484
Where you goin'? Where you goin'?
Where the fuck you goin'?

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.096
Come here. Let me tell you something.

01:23:55.196 --> 01:23:56.613
Let me tell you something.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:00.784
The answer's no.

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.619
I ain't askin'.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.002
The answer is no.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:15.116
By the time I'm through with you,
you wouldn't wanna see him.

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.868
He won't wanna touch you.
Do you understand?

01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:19.204
- Get off me!
- You understand?

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.039
- You understand?
- Get off me!

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.832
He wouldn't wanna fuckin' touch you.
Do you understand?

01:24:22.932 --> 01:24:24.808
You understand now, huh?

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:33.627
Well?

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:35.963
Sit down.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.384
Ma'am?

01:25:41.344 --> 01:25:42.553
Ma'am?

01:25:44.889 --> 01:25:46.041
Yes?

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.975
Is there a Thomas Whitewood here?

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.271
Are you Thomas whitewood?

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:56.984
- What about it?
- I need you to sign this.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:05.117
Please, just sign it.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.164
What is this?

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.211
Thank you.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:27.332
Somebody give your name
to the grand jury.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:30.517
All right! You mother fucker!

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.850
Mother fucker!

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:47.227
Skunk!

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.744
Mother fucker!

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:37.902
Hell, man.
Don't worry about no subpoena.

01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:39.628
They got nothin' on you.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:41.505
Yeah.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:45.243
Gee, I sure hope not.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:48.512
They're just fishing
for something or other.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.040
Now...

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.377
Where the hell is this tractor, anyhow?

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.296
- Patch?
- Up a ways.

01:27:56.396 --> 01:28:00.884
This is one hell of
a Jesus H. Christ kind of place

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:04.012
to go find some tractor.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:09.574
We only found it because last year, Dickie,
he poached a deer up in these woods.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:13.912
A white deer. Right over in there.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:23.130
Now, what's that...

01:28:27.593 --> 01:28:30.721
Damn, I thought he was gonna
back right into the grave.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:03.613
You know, Aggie,
I like that ring you got.

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:06.006
- What did it cost?
- Beats me.

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.110
Is that a real sapphire?

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:12.454
Wouldn't you like to know!

01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.224
Yeah, I would.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:23.690
Is that a real gun?

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:52.537
Come on, right over here!

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:54.262
Get your tickets right here!

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:56.932
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.210
Ever been out west, Tommy?

01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:27.947
No.

01:30:28.047 --> 01:30:29.673
Never heard a coyote?

01:30:31.418 --> 01:30:32.744
No.

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.929
They make this sound like...

01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:39.933
Coyote bitch gets in heat,

01:30:41.018 --> 01:30:42.727
first thing she does,

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:44.896
she'd take care of the males.

01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:49.109
Then she head toward town.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.779
All the neighborhood dogs,
they smell her.

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.906
They go crazy.

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:57.784
They follow her.

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:03.373
She lures them out onto the desert.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:05.709
She get the dog out there...

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.587
...alone.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:12.075
All the other coyote come along.

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:16.454
They circle around and kill that dog,

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:17.888
eat it.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:21.766
Tommy,

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:25.713
if you was to go up
in front of that grand jury,

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.272
what would you say?

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.483
Nothing.

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:35.840
- Dad.
- Liar!

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.815
That's our deal.
You let me outta here right now,

01:32:25.915 --> 01:32:27.457
or I don't say one more word.

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:30.710
Can't do it. Your father's hiding
three kids already.

01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:35.533
Besides, the only thing you've talked
about so far are tractor thefts.

01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:37.676
Why should we think you have
anything else to tell us?

01:32:39.637 --> 01:32:41.555
Have you guys ever heard
of Lester Peralsky?

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:52.065
Ma, Terry and I are leaving.
We're getting out of here.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.386
- Leaving?
- Going where?

01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:57.487
- I got relatives in...
- Far away.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.658
Do you have money we can borrow?

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.661
Not really.

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.748
Well, I have a little.

01:33:10.042 --> 01:33:11.068
Great.

01:33:11.168 --> 01:33:13.112
Say, Brad Jr.,

01:33:13.212 --> 01:33:15.531
have you heard anything from Tommy?

01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:16.631
No.

01:33:17.508 --> 01:33:19.634
I don't even wanna think about Tommy.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.998
What is that supposed to mean?

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:26.042
Just itself.

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:27.684
Don't think about him.

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:48.872
How about this?

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:51.833
Let's tie him to a tree

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:54.753
in the back of the woods

01:33:55.379 --> 01:33:57.907
and just stare at him for a while.

01:33:58.007 --> 01:33:59.049
No.

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.635
But can't you just see it?

01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:03.970
He's tied to a tree.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:06.332
Naked.

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:10.711
And we could give him
like a lollipop or somethin'

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.771
- or a can of Budweiser.
- Shut up.

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:18.735
Suppose that little girl is with him?

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:22.155
Then bye-bye, girl.

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:25.492
That's too bad.

01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:27.952
She was real cute.

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:32.707
Might be better, uh,

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.418
if it was at night.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:38.755
Right?

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.998
I don't want no part of this.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.306
Boyd.

01:34:50.476 --> 01:34:52.185
You got the soul of a pig.

01:34:55.106 --> 01:34:56.523
A stuck pig.

01:34:58.442 --> 01:34:59.677
Sooey.

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:01.486
Sooey, sooey.

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:06.616
I don't care.

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:10.412
I'm not touching this one.

01:35:11.914 --> 01:35:13.164
Okay.

01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:25.635
Well?

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.646
You can hang it up
where you're going to.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.496
I mean, if you want to.

01:35:54.373 --> 01:35:55.498
Thanks.

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.079
Better go.

01:36:08.179 --> 01:36:09.471
Brad?

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:13.933
It's something over 400.

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:16.019
Thanks a lot.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.688
I guess it's a rainy day.

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:22.525
Thanks, grandma.

01:36:29.366 --> 01:36:31.117
- Take care of Terry, now.
- I will.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:35.538
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

01:37:32.763 --> 01:37:34.290
How's it coming?

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:35.682
It's almost there.

01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:38.768
It could wait till morning.

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.730
No. Your mother'll be back
in the morning.

01:37:43.482 --> 01:37:45.468
Farther we are away,
it'll be a lot better.

01:38:07.673 --> 01:38:11.118
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and have a Pepsi day

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:13.412
It's the laughter of a world at play

01:38:13.512 --> 01:38:15.539
Memories of a Pepsi day

01:38:15.639 --> 01:38:18.209
C'mon, c'mon and have a Pepsi day

01:38:18.309 --> 01:38:20.211
You're the Pepsi Generation

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:25.090
Come and have a Pepsi day

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:08.566
Oh, I forgot to feed the dog.

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:12.612
Oh, no!

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:27.205
Hey, Dad.

01:41:34.713 --> 01:41:35.963
Let you outta the stir?

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:40.953
Yeah. I... I just told them
a pack of lies.

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:43.872
And now I'm just running
where they can't find me.

01:41:43.972 --> 01:41:45.223
That's good.

01:41:47.518 --> 01:41:49.185
Nobody can find me.

01:41:50.354 --> 01:41:51.604
Good.

01:41:53.982 --> 01:41:55.274
You got a beer?

01:41:57.569 --> 01:41:58.820
Yeah, sure.

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:11.916
I got to take a leak.

01:42:56.086 --> 01:42:57.253
Dad.

01:43:05.888 --> 01:43:07.138
It's good to see you.

01:43:08.098 --> 01:43:09.182
Really.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.270
You look pale.

01:43:15.105 --> 01:43:16.355
I am pale.

01:43:22.112 --> 01:43:23.446
Where you been tonight?

01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:30.687
I got drunk, had a fight.
Mary sue, you know, kicked her out.

01:43:30.787 --> 01:43:33.789
Went to Andy's.
Same old thing, you know?

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.583
Yeah, I know.

01:43:37.628 --> 01:43:38.920
You know where I been?

01:43:47.971 --> 01:43:50.848
It's nothing.
I just cut myself on some barbed wire.

01:43:52.684 --> 01:43:55.921
Don't move. I said, don't fuckin' move!

01:43:56.021 --> 01:43:58.648
- Just going to get some...
- I said, don't fuckin' move!

01:44:01.151 --> 01:44:02.610
Is this the gun you used?

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:05.488
That's a nice-looking gun.

01:44:10.452 --> 01:44:13.021
Is this the gun you used to kill Tommy?
Tommy's dead, isn't he?

01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:15.164
Don't talk to me about Tommy.

01:44:15.874 --> 01:44:17.750
Is this the gun you used to kill Terry?

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.503
I never did nothin' to Terry.

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:25.007
No! Whoa, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

01:44:25.634 --> 01:44:28.678
Is this the gun you used on everybody?
On me?

01:44:31.848 --> 01:44:33.724
Is this the family gun, Dad?

01:44:34.184 --> 01:44:35.393
Jesus.

01:44:37.187 --> 01:44:39.381
Put that down. What's eating you?

01:44:39.481 --> 01:44:40.799
You're gonna die.

01:44:40.899 --> 01:44:42.491
Come on...

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:46.263
I know one thing clearer than I've
ever known anything in my entire life,

01:44:46.363 --> 01:44:48.990
except that I loved Terry
before you killed her,

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.603
and that is that you're gonna die.

01:44:52.703 --> 01:44:53.995
You got the guts...

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:58.124
...to kill me?

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.695
I'm your blood. I'm your family.

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.739
You're not my family. Not anymore.

01:45:03.839 --> 01:45:05.574
Yeah, you're crazy.

01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:07.034
Crazy! Gone crazy. Crazy!

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:08.118
Nope.

01:45:08.218 --> 01:45:10.136
Listen. Listen!

01:45:10.929 --> 01:45:12.471
- What?
- I know how it is.

01:45:13.056 --> 01:45:16.460
Cops got ya in there, get your head
all fucked-up. I know how that is.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.185
My mind's simple, Dad.

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:22.064
Before they got you twisted,

01:45:23.108 --> 01:45:25.594
you must have known somethin',
you must've felt it.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:28.195
I gave you money.
I gave you car. I took you in.

01:45:29.239 --> 01:45:30.349
Don't that mean somethin'?

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:31.741
Means what?

01:45:33.035 --> 01:45:34.410
Means what?

01:45:36.413 --> 01:45:38.815
It means I got feelin' for you.

01:45:38.915 --> 01:45:40.484
What fuckin' feeling?

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:42.110
I care.

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:44.211
What do you... I love you.

01:45:45.088 --> 01:45:46.839
What... Is that what you want to hear?

01:45:47.924 --> 01:45:49.425
- I love you.
- Yeah?

01:45:52.596 --> 01:45:54.013
Mother fucker!

01:45:57.851 --> 01:45:59.143
I love you, too, Dad.

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.342
Whoa!

01:46:05.442 --> 01:46:06.650
Don't!

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.627
No.

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:28.756
No, I ain't you.

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:33.844
Besides, this is too easy.

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.307
I want you to die slow.

01:46:39.351 --> 01:46:42.728
I want you to die every day
for the rest of your life.

01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:07.711
Go on.

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.775
- Hey...
- Don't fuckin' move!

01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:46.083
I didn't move.

01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:26.517
Your name?

01:49:28.687 --> 01:49:30.145
Bradford Whitewood.

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:34.191
And what do they call you?

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:38.529
Brad. Little Brad. Brad Jr.

01:49:40.448 --> 01:49:42.893
And is there a Brad Sr.?

01:49:42.993 --> 01:49:44.535
A big Brad?

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:53.669
Yes.

01:49:54.254 --> 01:49:55.546
Who is he?

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.620
My father.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.137
What did you say?

01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:37.921
He's my father.

01:50:56.232 --> 01:51:02.446
<i>I have a tale to tell</i>

01:51:04.866 --> 01:51:10.829
<i>Sometimes it gets so hard
to hide it well</i>

01:51:14.626 --> 01:51:20.089
<i>I was not ready for the fall</i>

01:51:22.258 --> 01:51:28.263
<i>Too blind to see the writing on the wall</i>

01:51:31.142 --> 01:51:35.213
<i>A man can tell a thousand lies</i>

01:51:35.313 --> 01:51:38.550
<i>I've learned my lesson well</i>

01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:40.677
<i>Hope I live to tell</i>

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:46.016
<i>The secret I have learned, 'till then</i>

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:51.829
<i>It will burn inside of me</i>

01:52:08.138 --> 01:52:14.351
<i>I know where beauty lives</i>

01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:18.798
<i>I've seen it once</i>

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:23.485
<i>I know the warmth she gives</i>

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:31.952
<i>The light that you could never see</i>

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:40.210
<i>It shines inside,
you can't take that from me</i>

01:52:43.298 --> 01:52:47.202
<i>A man can tell a thousand lies</i>

01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:50.330

<i>The truth is never far behind</i>

01:53:11.326 --> 01:53:14.437
<i>You kept it hidden well</i>

01:53:14.537 --> 01:53:16.648
<i>If I live to tell</i>

01:53:16.748 --> 01:53:19.818
<i>The secret I knew then</i>

01:53:19.918 --> 01:53:26.590
<i>Will I ever have the chance again</i>

01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:45.927
<i>If I ran away</i>

01:53:46.027 --> 01:53:51.808
<i>I'd never have the strength
to go very far</i>

01:53:51.908 --> 01:53:54.811
<i>How would they hear</i>

01:53:54.911 --> 01:54:00.567
<i>The beating of my heart</i>

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:03.611
<i>Will it grow cold</i>

01:54:03.711 --> 01:54:07.031
<i>The secret that I hide</i>

01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:09.409
<i>Will I grow old</i>

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:11.745
<i>How will they hear</i>

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:13.872
<i>When will they learn</i>

01:54:13.972 --> 01:54:18.725
<i>How will they know</i>

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:31.681
<i>A man can tell a thousand lies</i>

01:54:31.781 --> 01:54:35.018
