Don't you move one more paw!

11:04.264 --> 11:06.031
EVERYPONY STOP!

11:06.033 --> 11:07.932
[tire screech]

11:09.735 --> 11:10.869

11:11.871 --> 11:12.871
OK, now it's a mess.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.873
[pow]

11:14.875 --> 11:16.741
What are we gonna do?

11:16.743 --> 11:19.811
I don't know, but Twilight's
blowout won't take that long!

11:19.813 --> 11:21.746
If she was avoiding
the castle before,

11:21.748 --> 11:23.748
she'll never set
hoof in here now!

11:23.750 --> 11:24.816
Come on, guys!

11:24.818 --> 11:26.017
We've gotta do something!

11:26.019 --> 11:28.319
Twilight's counting on us!

11:28.321 --> 11:31.956
Spike, you've got to get back
to that spa and stall her!

11:31.958 --> 11:34.359
Whatever you do, don't
let her come home!

11:34.361 --> 11:35.760
Like forever?

11:35.762 --> 11:36.828
But we live here.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.731
Well uh, maybe you
could manage until...

11:39.733 --> 11:40.865
...sunsetish?

11:43.102 --> 11:44.936
Anything for you, Rarity!

11:46.872 --> 11:49.741
OK, we all agree the castle
is too cluttered, right?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.944
So why doesn't everypony take
one of their own decorations out

11:52.946 --> 11:54.412
and we'll see how it looks?

11:54.414 --> 11:55.980
Uh huh!

11:57.917 --> 11:59.417
Spike, you're back!

11:59.419 --> 12:00.885
How do I look?

12:02.355 --> 12:06.725
And more importantly,
how does the castle look?

12:06.727 --> 12:08.326
Great!

12:08.328 --> 12:10.361
I can't wait to go
home and see it!

12:10.363 --> 12:11.329
Great!

12:11.331 --> 12:12.964
I mean, NO!

12:12.966 --> 12:15.900
I mean, uh, I'm not
quite ready to go yet.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.802
Why don't we have a massage?

12:17.804 --> 12:20.338
I was really hoping to
get uh, this thingy!

12:20.340 --> 12:23.341
The extra strength hot
stone deep tissue massage?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.776
[gulp]

12:24.778 --> 12:28.346
I think I'll just have
a traditional massage,

12:28.348 --> 12:30.348
but you go for it.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.817
Did somepony order massages?

12:32.819 --> 12:33.818
[crash]

12:33.820 --> 12:35.120
YEAH!

12:35.122 --> 12:37.756
Let's DO this, little dragon!

12:39.859 --> 12:40.959
[crash]

12:40.961 --> 12:42.460
Oh, I hate it when
he does that.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.429
Come with me, Princess.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.366
Come on, Rarity.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.369
Everypony has taken
somethin' out except you.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.837
I know!

12:52.839 --> 12:54.105
I simply can't decide.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.074
How about this?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.408
No! Not that!

12:57.410 --> 12:58.910
Anything but that!

12:58.912 --> 13:00.411
How about these?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.913
But those brighten
up the whole room!

13:01.915 --> 13:03.815
They're my favorite accent!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.450
Then let's lose the curtains.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.885
The room wouldn't
need brightening

13:06.887 --> 13:08.520
if they weren't
making it so dark!

13:08.522 --> 13:09.521
Not them!

13:09.523 --> 13:11.489
They're my favorite, too!

13:11.491 --> 13:14.192
They can't all be
your favorite!

13:14.194 --> 13:15.994
OK, I'm taking
down the portrait.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.929
We already know
what we look like.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.869
The room still looks a little
bit cluttered, doesn't it?

13:24.871 --> 13:26.504
Perhaps I'll take
down a poster or two.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.207
Only to be helpful, of course!

13:29.209 --> 13:32.143
OK, everypony calm down.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.546
I'm sure we can find a way
to remove the clutter...

13:34.548 --> 13:35.547
together!

13:35.549 --> 13:37.182
You're absolutely
right, dear.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.251
Hey! Those are my
warmin' quilts!

13:41.587 --> 13:43.154
Together!

13:43.156 --> 13:45.190
[popping]

13:45.192 --> 13:48.927
Fluttershy, tell your birds to
stop pecking at my balloons!

13:48.929 --> 13:51.162
I guess they must not like being
scared out of their wits

13:51.164 --> 13:54.132
by exploding confetti
cannons or something.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.234
But we can't get
rid of the cannons!

13:56.236 --> 13:58.036
I don't remember
where I hid 'em!

13:58.038 --> 13:59.170
[pop]

13:59.172 --> 14:00.605
Allow me to help you!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.006
Applejack: Oh no,
I'll help you!

14:02.008 --> 14:03.575
Rainbow: NOT IF I
HELP YOU FIRST!

14:05.044 --> 14:08.580
Ah. Great
suggestion, Spike.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.182
I feel totally relaxed.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.552
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

14:14.554 --> 14:15.920
You wanna hop on?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.922
Maybe I can get us
to the castle faster.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.028
OW!

14:24.030 --> 14:25.196
I mean, how...

14:25.198 --> 14:27.065
nice is this day?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.601
I was hoping we could
take the scenic way back.

14:29.603 --> 14:30.869
I don't know.

14:30.871 --> 14:34.172
Walking is good for
post-massage circulation.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.273
Really?

14:35.275 --> 14:36.941
I've never heard
that theory.

14:39.945 --> 14:43.281
[sigh] I really miss
this place, Spike.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.917
We had so many wonderful
memories here.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.587
We did, didn't we?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.956
Oh Spike, I'm so sorry.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.260
Of course losing the Golden Oak
Library was hard for you too.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.129
I've got an idea!

14:58.131 --> 14:59.998
Why don't we have the
girls add some things

15:00.000 --> 15:02.500
to make the castle feel more
like your home as well?

15:02.502 --> 15:03.902
Really?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.069
Hop on!

15:09.642 --> 15:10.642
[thud]

15:10.644 --> 15:11.643
Ow!

15:11.645 --> 15:15.980
I, um, I just thought
of what I want.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.583
Oh. OK. What is it?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.684
It's a...

15:19.686 --> 15:20.952
Well, I want a...

15:20.954 --> 15:22.987
it's - I kinda need a...

15:22.989 --> 15:24.622
A bed.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.292
I thought you said you sleep
like a baby in the castle.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.628
Pfft! Everypony knows babies
are terrible sleepers.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.930
Let's go!

15:34.667 --> 15:37.669
There! Now nothing is
cluttering the castle!

15:37.671 --> 15:42.307
There is literally NOTHING
cluttering this castle!

15:42.309 --> 15:44.309
What do we do now?

15:44.311 --> 15:47.111
I hate to be the bearer
of more bad news,

15:47.113 --> 15:48.680
but it's almost sunset.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.583
it's going to look like we
didn't lift a hoof to help her.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.252
Why is this so hard?

15:54.254 --> 15:55.954
We're Twilight's best friends.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.622
This should be easy for us!

15:57.624 --> 16:00.191
She said it herself: if
anypony should be able

16:00.193 --> 16:03.962
to make her feel comfortable
in her new home, it's us.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.563
If we can't do it...

16:05.565 --> 16:07.665
...then Twilight will be
stuck living in a castle

16:07.667 --> 16:10.101
that just makes her
feel sad...

16:10.103 --> 16:11.269
[echoes]

16:11.271 --> 16:14.272
...sad...sad.

didn't know you could be

16:17.043 --> 16:18.409
loud enough to echo.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.749
[muttering to
herself]

16:24.751 --> 16:27.018
What do we do?
What do we do?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.586
If Twilight comes home
now she'll be like

16:28.588 --> 16:31.322
And we'll have to
be like "NOTHING!"

16:31.324 --> 16:33.057
And then she'll be like
"I was counting on you!

16:33.059 --> 16:34.459
Some friends you are!"

16:34.461 --> 16:35.693
and we'll be like "AAAHHH!"

16:35.695 --> 16:39.630
[blubbering]

16:39.632 --> 16:41.099
Calm down, Pinkie.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.034
We just need to figure
out what we did wrong

16:43.036 --> 16:44.469
so we can make it right.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.404
Rarity: Well, I didn't
do anything wrong.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.740
I did exactly what I would
do if this were my home.

16:48.742 --> 16:52.010
But it's not your home;
it's Twilight's home!

16:52.012 --> 16:54.779
Where she keeps all her
Rainbow Dash trophies?

16:54.781 --> 16:57.615
Fluttershy: Maybe we're
all a little guilty

16:57.617 --> 17:01.085
of making ourselves feel at
home instead of Twilight.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.055
Come on, y'all, we just need
to think about Twilight!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.390
What was it she
loved about living

17:05.392 --> 17:07.158
in the Golden Oak Library?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.793
Oh, everything!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.628
The books, the
smell of books,

17:10.630 --> 17:13.398
the joy she felt from
organizing books.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.533
Remember that time I crashed
into all those books

17:15.535 --> 17:19.103
attempting my Sonic Rainboom
after you guys just cleaned up?

17:19.105 --> 17:22.106
[sigh] That was good times.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.641
Yeah, for YOU, maybe.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.678
remember when we were stuck
having a sleepover there?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.481
That turned out
to be so much fun!

17:30.483 --> 17:33.684
Remember the time it got
blown up to smithereens?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.722
Wait, no. That
was the worst!

17:37.724 --> 17:40.525
We had a lot of good
memories there, though.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.528
That's what made the
Golden Oak Library home.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.532

Too lumpy?

Ummm...

17:57.543 --> 17:59.210
Just right! I'll take it!

17:59.212 --> 18:01.079
Oh, thank goodness.

I thought you'd never
find one you liked.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.758
Whoa! What
happened in here?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.361
Last I checked this
place was empty!

21:03.363 --> 21:04.962
I couldn't help myself.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.365
It was just begging
for the personal touch.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.368
Truth be told, I
couldn't either.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.671
Your kitchen might have some
rustic farm decor, Twilight.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.840
And there may or may not be
some Derring Do posters

21:15.842 --> 21:17.375
up in your library.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.677
And some stuffed
animals in your bedroom.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.978
[pop and cheers]

21:20.980 --> 21:22.747
What was that?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.750
One of Pinkie Pie's
confetti cannons.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.886
What! It's not my fault
I hid them so well!

21:28.888 --> 21:30.988
[sigh] Ah, Pinkie!
