00:07.215 --> 00:08.758
- Hello.
My name is Detective Avraham.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.635
- This is my son, Vincent.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.636
He's missing.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.722
- When did you
last see Vincent?

00:13.763 --> 00:14.973
- Monday?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.224
I'm his tutor,
just helping him

00:16.266 --> 00:17.642
with his, uh,
writing skills.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.685
- Well, Zack's a writer.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.520
Why is there
a letter from Vincent?

00:20.562 --> 00:23.106
- This is what writers do.
We channel.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.066
- I don't believe you.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.944
- My feeling is that Vincent
never left that building

00:27.986 --> 00:30.030
on Tuesday morning.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.656
He's contained.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.700
- I never made a decision
to kiss him.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.201
It just happened.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.536
Vincent told you.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.121
You knew.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.415
- We got a 16-year-old missing
boy last seen with you,

00:40.457 --> 00:42.876
a homeless man of
questionable mental health--

00:42.917 --> 00:45.170
someone who was broomed from
his previous teaching career.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.963
You don't exactly
present well, John.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.132
- Why don't you say it?
You think he's dead.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.967
- Do you think
your son is dead?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.761
- How dare you ask me that?

00:52.802 --> 00:55.013
- His luggage.
The large one is not here.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.556
Where's the large?
- I don't know.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.224
- He wouldn't run away
because of something

00:58.266 --> 00:59.809
that I said or did.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.894
- Why would he run away?

01:00.935 --> 01:01.853
Do you have any idea?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.104
- No.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.901
[moody tone]

01:07.942 --> 01:15.116
* *

02:00.036 --> 02:02.956
[uneasy music]

02:02.997 --> 02:10.171

02:19.681 --> 02:21.349
[faucet running]

02:24.436 --> 02:27.355

02:27.397 --> 02:34.529

02:40.702 --> 02:42.662

02:49.210 --> 02:56.343

03:13.068 --> 03:16.571
[chiming noise]

03:20.575 --> 03:23.703
[contemplative music]

03:23.745 --> 03:30.669
* *

03:32.379 --> 03:35.924
[children playing in distance]

03:37.926 --> 03:39.552
- The mother.

03:39.594 --> 03:42.472
We're now seeing his
mother in the fish.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.391
- I can't really explain it.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.642
- I'm not gonna ask you to.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.727
You see anything
else in there, Avi?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.896
'Cause I will tell
you what I see.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.233
I see a fury
bordering on a mania

03:53.274 --> 03:54.901
bordering on disorder.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.361
- It's a process.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.779
- Yeah, I'm familiar.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.281
The longer a case goes on,
the more intense you get,

04:00.323 --> 04:02.575
the more intense your drawings.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.411
Did your mother draw?

04:04.452 --> 04:07.414
- This is not about my mother.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.873
- Is it about Vincent's?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.000
- How are we doing?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.001
[chuckles]

04:11.042 --> 04:12.627
Late night, I see.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.130
- We got a report that Kids
Campus is receiving threats.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.298
I need you to go check it out.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.758
- Meaning what?
I'm off this thing here?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.594
- Meaning when a day care in
our area receives threats,

04:21.636 --> 04:22.887
we check it out, Earl.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.514
We need to multitask.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.640
Rebecca took the call.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.058
Get the report and go, please.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.310
- We should also circle
back to the school,

04:29.352 --> 04:31.354
revisit everyone
in Vincent's life.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.398
Benjamin, Hailey Townsend,
her boyfriend.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.066
We are not dealing
with something random.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.943
I know it.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.739
- Oh.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.492
- Do I need to take
you off this case,

04:44.534 --> 04:46.786
put someone else on?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.121
Fresh eyes?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.748
- I'm almost there.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.376
- That's what you keep saying.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.004
By the way, there's
someone downstairs

04:56.046 --> 04:57.672
to speak to you and Janine.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.387
- Can we help you?

05:04.429 --> 05:05.805
- Uh, yes.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.683
I'm here about the missing
boy, Vincent Conte.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.226
I may have information.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.103
- What sort of information?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.146
- Well, perhaps none.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.105
- What's your name?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.982
- Michael Rosen.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.484
I teach a writing class.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.652
I have a student who's been
writing about a missing boy

05:19.694 --> 05:21.488
with similarities
to some of the details

05:21.529 --> 05:24.074
I've heard on the news
about this Vincent Conte.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.700
Come to learn
the student actually lives

05:25.742 --> 05:27.327
in the boy's building.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.412
- What's the student's name?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.997
- Zachary Miller.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.084
- Let's go upstairs.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.464
- As you can see,
the material's riveting,

05:39.506 --> 05:42.467
which is what first
made me suspicious.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.302
- Why?

05:45.178 --> 05:48.181
- Well, Zack has been
consistently mediocre.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.516
His work lacks.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.351
It's like he's
on the outside looking in.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.061
He just can't get there.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.690
I actually told him to give up
the pursuit of the craft.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.608
That's how uninspiring
I found it all.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.488
Then suddenly,
within the last week,

06:03.530 --> 06:05.490
he's writing this,

06:05.532 --> 06:07.367
like he's on the inside of it--

06:07.409 --> 06:08.993
well inside.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.537
And that he lives
in the kid's building

06:10.578 --> 06:12.497
gives me a very uneasy feeling.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.710
- It's not exactly
probative of anything.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.421
- It's too coincidental.
Add to that, these people

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
have been withholding.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.216
He's clearly writing
about Vincent's relationship

06:23.258 --> 06:24.592
with his parents.
- Even so,

06:24.634 --> 06:26.011
it doesn't make
him guilty of anything.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.138
What are we gonna do,
arrest him for plagiarism?

06:28.179 --> 06:29.264
- I'm with Avi on this.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.682
They've both been
playing hide the ball.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.726
- Okay, let's say this tutor
does have something to do

06:32.767 --> 06:34.019
with Vincent's disappearance.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.895
Do we really think that
he would write about it?

06:35.937 --> 06:38.023
- He might. Some twisted call
for attention.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.942
I'm gonna bring him in.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.068
- On what grounds?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.320
- My suggestion is
that we call them in

06:44.362 --> 06:45.822
to help.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.991
If we do some aggressive
round up, they'll get lawyers.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.577
So let's just ask them nicely
to come in and help us.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.663
I mean,
clearly Zack wants to play.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.624
[dramatic music]

06:56.666 --> 06:59.419
* *

06:59.461 --> 07:00.628
- Okay.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.005
- Great.
Thank you.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.675
* *

07:11.556 --> 07:13.933
- This morning.

07:13.975 --> 07:14.934
Okay.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.770
Yeah, I suppose
we could do that.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.564
Sure.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.192
Yeah, 10:00 is fine.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.276
See you there.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.280
- What's going on?

07:27.322 --> 07:29.115
- Some new developments.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.909
They got some security footage.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.912
They want us to take a look,

07:33.953 --> 07:35.955
see if we recognize anybody.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.378
- Did they say they have
an actual suspect?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.465
- No.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.301
[uneasy music]

07:48.343 --> 07:50.136
10:00.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.555
We can drop off Luke
at my mother's on the way.

07:52.597 --> 07:58.728
* *

07:58.770 --> 08:00.814
- Thank you so much
for coming in.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.942
- Yeah. What's this, uh,
new development?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.111
- Well, could be
just a blind alley,

08:06.152 --> 08:08.113
but we're turning over
every stone.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.865
We just would like for you
to look at some stills.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.826
- Earl, take Zack
to see, would you?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.245
Janine, you and Dania
can go to the spare room.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.080
- You're splitting us up?

08:17.122 --> 08:20.375
- If you and your wife happened
to identify the same person,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.544
we don't want his
or her lawyer arguing

08:22.585 --> 08:25.505
that the ID was suggestive.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.340
- Follow me, boss.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.343
[tense tone]

08:30.385 --> 08:37.350
* *

08:38.977 --> 08:40.645
- I have to say,
I'm getting

08:40.687 --> 08:41.980
a very odd feeling here.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.481
- Well, that's understandable.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.483
We're all unsettled.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.985
A boy is missing.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.820
One might argue
it would be more odd

08:48.862 --> 08:51.281
not to have an odd feeling.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.491
You otherwise doing okay?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.702
- Just fine.
Can I see these photos please?

08:55.744 --> 08:57.162
- Of course.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.997
Actually, before we
get to the pictures,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.790
I thought we might start
with this.

09:00.832 --> 09:03.752
[tense music]

09:03.793 --> 09:10.133
* *

09:10.175 --> 09:12.010
- Where did you get these?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.845
- Your writing instructor
brought them.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.597
He had concerns...

09:15.638 --> 09:17.515
as now do I.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.059
- What is going on here?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.770
- Well, that's my question
for you, sir.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.980
You seem to have
an intimate knowledge

09:24.022 --> 09:27.859
of Vincent's insecurities,
his fears, his frustrations.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.028
- No, this was
a writing assignment.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.863
- It's time to cut
the shit, Mr. Miller.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.198
- Careful.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.743
- Don't you have
somewhere to be, Earl?

09:36.785 --> 09:39.204
- This is excellent writing.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.040
And from what I'm told, you're
not an excellent writer.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.875
Did Vincent write this letter?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.544
* *

09:46.586 --> 09:48.046
- No.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.548
- You clearly had insight
as to his state of mind.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
You neglected to share
this insight with me.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.054
At a minimum, you failed
to aid this investigation.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.555
More likely, you obstructed it.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.973
- Obstr--obstructed?

09:59.015 --> 10:02.519
You have treated me
like a suspect from the start.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.729
- Whether or not that's true,
I certainly

10:04.771 --> 10:05.939
consider you one now,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.857
and your best path
to exoneration

10:07.899 --> 10:10.360
is a straight
and truthful line.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.570
Are you sexually
attracted to Vincent?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.905
- What?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.198
- Some of the emails
between you two

10:15.240 --> 10:16.533
suggest a certain intimacy.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.576
- No, I'm not sexually
attracted to Vincent.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.954
- His father had concerns
as to your sexuality.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.205
- Did he?
Did he have concerns?

10:22.247 --> 10:23.915
'Cause I had concerns
about him, too.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.875
He was--he was punishing.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.919
He oppressed Vincent
at every turn.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.921
Look, a big part
of my tutelage of Vincent

10:29.963 --> 10:32.090
was bolstering his esteem.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.842
You are off base
and way out of line.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.093
- I don't think so.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.636
You had knowledge
of what was going on

10:36.678 --> 10:37.887
with this young man's psyche.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.597
You chose to conceal it.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.517
You're facing a bit
of trouble, Mr. Miller.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.944
- It is serious, Dania.

10:52.986 --> 10:57.323
Let's face it: a bit damning.
- This is a writing exercise.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.701
He said he was trying
to get in Vincent's head.

10:59.743 --> 11:01.536
- I understand.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.913
Clearly, he has
an ability to do so.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.708
So why not share
that insight with us?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.713
Some of this,
as I understand it,

11:11.755 --> 11:14.591
is drawing
from Vincent's actual words.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.176
Admissions.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.055
Just explain to me how
you chose to sit on that.

11:20.096 --> 11:25.310
How do you reconcile that with
claiming to care about him?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.312
You spoke of how vulnerable

11:27.354 --> 11:29.147
you know Vincent to be,
and yet--

11:29.189 --> 11:30.982
- I just found out about this.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.693
- But you sat on it.

11:33.735 --> 11:34.903
You didn't tell his parents.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.196
You didn't tell us.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.199
[tense tone]

11:39.240 --> 11:41.034
* *

11:41.076 --> 11:43.078
- Actually--

11:43.119 --> 11:46.164
- Actually what?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.208
Actually what, Dania?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.793
- How many times
do I need to say this?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.671
I have no actual knowledge
as to what happened here.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.506
- "I have been gone
for a long time.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.467
You made me disappear."
- I conjured that.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.178
- "I suggest you stop looking
because you will not find me."

12:00.220 --> 12:01.721
- I want a lawyer.
I want a lawyer.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.722
- It appears you need one.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.848
- Avi.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.517
- We are not done here.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.893
- Now.

12:06.935 --> 12:14.067
* *

12:16.236 --> 12:18.071
[door shuts]

12:24.703 --> 12:27.747
- Dania, please, tell
Detective Avraham

12:27.789 --> 12:29.207
what you just told me.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.001
- Which part?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.377
- The part that
caused me to say,

12:32.419 --> 12:33.837
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

12:33.878 --> 12:35.588
That part.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.886
- Well... she had asked if--

12:41.928 --> 12:47.350
she asked how I could just sit
on what I know, this here.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.270
And I told her
I didn't completely sit on it.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.524
I couldn't sleep last night
because it was weighing on me.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.528
So I made copies,
put them in an envelope,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.655
and slipped them under
the Contes' door.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.451
- When exactly did you do this?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.953
- It was around 3:00 a.m.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.247
- Last night?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.582
- Yes.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.168
- The letters
purportedly from Vincent.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.587
You slid them
under the Contes' door.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.632
- Yes.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.844
- Dania, what would
compel you to do this?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.763
- Well, she's my friend.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.100
Or she was my friend.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.394
This is her worst nightmare.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.271
And all I've done is make
things harder for her.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.439
- But why the letters?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.941
- Well, I didn't
know what else to do.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.069
Zack wanted to keep
the letters to ourselves.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.529
But what if something in here
could lead Nora to her son?

13:41.571 --> 13:43.114
Slipping the letters
under the door

13:43.156 --> 13:44.616
seemed like the best option.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.701
- Does your husband know
you did this?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.620
- No.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.503
- Dania, is there anything else
you haven't told us?

13:56.544 --> 13:59.339
Because now would
very much be the time.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.928
- Mm-hmm.
There's more.

14:09.099 --> 14:13.687
- I think Zack knew
that I had kissed Vincent.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.897
I--I asked--

14:15.939 --> 14:19.818
I accused him of knowing,
and he didn't deny it.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.486
He knew.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.488
- Are you suggesting
Zack might have

14:23.530 --> 14:24.823
retaliated against Vincent?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.658
- No.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.327
No, I'm not
suggesting anything.

14:30.704 --> 14:34.457
All I can suggest
at the moment is,

14:34.499 --> 14:37.377
I don't know my husband
anymore.

14:37.419 --> 14:44.551
* *

14:47.220 --> 14:50.181
- This is fucked up.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.518
- So if I'm following,

14:53.560 --> 14:55.186
Nora and Leonard
got these letters

14:55.228 --> 14:59.190
supposedly written
by their son.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.233
And, what, they've
done nothing?

15:00.275 --> 15:02.569
They haven't called it in?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.863
- It means they know he's dead.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.242
- We can't jump to that.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.744
- Yes, we can.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.621
The parents get information
that may help in our search.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.582
They choose not to reveal it.

15:15.623 --> 15:19.210
That tells me they know
our search to be futile.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.503
They know he's dead.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.213
- That's a lot of assuming.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.424
- Tell me what you think.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.552
- Are the Millers still here?
- In lockup.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.179
We're holding them.
- On what grounds?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.472
- On whatever.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.015
We can't have them
tipping off the Contes

15:32.057 --> 15:33.933
that we know that they know
of those letters.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.896
- [sighs]

15:37.937 --> 15:39.481
How do we play this?

15:39.522 --> 15:46.654
* *

15:48.114 --> 15:49.991
- Come with me.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.874
[dishware clattering]

15:57.916 --> 16:00.627
[phone ringing]

16:09.094 --> 16:10.095
- Hello?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.222
- Hey, Nora. Dania.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.264
Any news?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.392
- No.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.227
- How are you holding up?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.896
How's Leonard?

16:19.938 --> 16:22.399
- Leonard is out of town
on business for the day.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.067
We're all holding up
best we can.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.487
Is there something
I can do for you?

16:30.657 --> 16:34.786
- Nora, I know you got
the letters from Vincent.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.541
I slid them under your door.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.292
I'm so sorry.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.545
But the thing is, evidently,

16:43.586 --> 16:47.215
Zack has been in touch
with Vincent.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.759
And--and possibly still is.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.345
Zack isn't telling me much,

16:52.387 --> 16:54.389
but I sense
he knows something.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.519
And I just couldn't
bear it any longer.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.856
So that's why
I slid them to you.

17:02.897 --> 17:07.485
* *

17:07.527 --> 17:11.906
Nora? Can you--
Are you there?

17:11.948 --> 17:14.951
- I'm here.

17:14.993 --> 17:18.580
- Well, should I give them
to the police?

17:20.582 --> 17:22.459
Can you hear me?

17:23.668 --> 17:26.629
- Vincent didn't write
those letters.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.507
- What do you mean?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.884
- I mean I know
my son's writing.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.302
He certainly didn't write them.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.972
* *

17:36.014 --> 17:37.891
[dial tone beeping]

17:40.643 --> 17:42.854
- Now we wait.
If she doesn't report the call

17:42.896 --> 17:45.648
or the letters,
that tells us something.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.317
Put her back in lockup.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.693
- Why?

17:48.735 --> 17:52.030
- Because you obstructed
our investigation, Dania.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.491
* *

18:11.549 --> 18:13.677
- You okay?

18:15.470 --> 18:18.598
- How long's it been?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.642
- Almost 30 minutes.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.773
- It's possible she's trying
to track down her husband,

18:26.815 --> 18:28.108
get his opinion before she--

18:28.149 --> 18:30.944
- Avi, she's guilty.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.987
Of what exactly,
maybe we don't know.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.281
But she's guilty.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.285
* *

18:39.327 --> 18:42.330
- Go pick her up.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.624
- Arrest her?

18:44.666 --> 18:48.211
- We don't have
enough for that.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.296
Just pick her up.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.299
[tense tone]

18:53.341 --> 19:00.265
* *

19:05.520 --> 19:07.981
- I didn't report any threat.

19:08.023 --> 19:11.192
And I would certainly know
if I did.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.153
- Uh, well, somebody,
uh, made the call,

19:13.194 --> 19:15.572
a Sarah Sowinsky.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.617
- Uh, Sarah?

19:21.369 --> 19:22.996
[clears throat]

19:25.665 --> 19:27.792
- Hi.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.836
- I told you about it.
I--I showed you.

19:29.878 --> 19:32.672
- Yes, you did not tell
me you called it in.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.132
- Well I just--
I thought that--

19:34.174 --> 19:35.842
- You showed her what?

19:35.884 --> 19:39.012
- Um--well, I just--
I thought--

19:39.054 --> 19:41.348
- You said you showed her.
Showed her what?

19:41.389 --> 19:46.853
- Um, well, when I came in
this morning to unlock, I, um--

19:46.895 --> 19:49.230
I found this taped
to the window.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.697
- And it wouldn't occur
to you to report this?

19:57.739 --> 19:59.491
- It's probably just a prank.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.036
- Hm.
That or a credible threat.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.038
Which side do you wanna err on?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.124
- Yeah, what do you
expect me to do?

20:08.166 --> 20:11.544
Shut down every time somebody
tapes a drawing to my window?

20:11.586 --> 20:15.173
- It's a drawing of a bomb,
ma'am.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.467
- Well, if you're
looking for suspects...

20:17.509 --> 20:18.760
- Yeah.
- I can give you two.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.970
- Okay.
- First, my landlord,

20:21.012 --> 20:23.390
who is dying for me
to break my lease

20:23.431 --> 20:25.058
so he can double my rent.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.187
And then walk two blocks down
to the new day care

20:29.229 --> 20:31.189
that just opened,
'cause they're also dying,

20:31.231 --> 20:32.816
in this case,
to steal my clients.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.609
So there is no bomb.

20:34.651 --> 20:38.154
Just two groups
of vicious, greedy people

20:38.196 --> 20:41.241
doing what vicious,
greedy people do.

20:41.282 --> 20:44.202
- Yeah, I'm not entirely s--
- No, and to be honest,

20:44.244 --> 20:47.080
you being here right now--
no offense--

20:47.122 --> 20:52.752
but you look, smell, and ooze
police officer,

20:52.794 --> 20:55.922
which is not
a good vibe for a day care

20:55.964 --> 20:59.217
when I am in the business
of selling happy.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.261
- And I'm in the business
of serving and protecting

21:01.302 --> 21:04.973
this community, of which you
and these children are a part.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.767
- And I'm just saying that
you're not doing that

21:07.809 --> 21:10.937
if you are helping
to close my doors.

21:14.315 --> 21:17.277
[mysterious music]

21:17.318 --> 21:24.242
* *

21:35.962 --> 21:38.423
- Do you know why you're here?

21:40.258 --> 21:42.635
Nora?

21:42.677 --> 21:45.305
Do you know why you're here?

21:45.347 --> 21:49.017
- I'm guessing you have
new information on the case.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.770
- Yes, there have been
some developments.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.026
We received letters
ostensibly written by Vincent.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.073
- They were not written by him.

22:03.114 --> 22:05.158
As I told Dania Miller
when she called,

22:05.200 --> 22:07.911
that was not
Vincent's writing style.

22:07.952 --> 22:11.498
- The point is, you received
them and didn't tell us.

22:11.539 --> 22:15.085
- We didn't tell you
because we didn't trust you.

22:15.126 --> 22:19.255
We knew you'd just accuse us
of hiding them or forging them

22:19.297 --> 22:22.217
or whatever you needed to say
to make us look guilty.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.013
- You also hid the fact
that Dania believed

22:27.055 --> 22:29.307
Zack might be in touch
with Vincent.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.851
Why would you not
report that to us?

22:31.893 --> 22:34.521
- Because I didn't
believe Dania.

22:34.562 --> 22:39.150
Quite frankly, I don't believe
a word she says about anything.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.860
Dania Miller is a sick person.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.696
She--she kissed Vincent.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.823
She's a sexual predator.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.533
For all I know,
she wrote those letters.

22:46.574 --> 22:50.203
I--I still don't understand
why you haven't arrested her.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.758
- We've been intently looking
for your son.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.052
I go to sleep
with Vincent in my head.

23:06.094 --> 23:08.847
And I wake up
with him in the morning.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.390
You get a phone call
from someone

23:10.432 --> 23:13.226
who tells you your husband
might know where Vincent is.

23:13.268 --> 23:16.229
And you don't
take it seriously.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.356
I don't believe that
a mother gets that call

23:18.398 --> 23:22.402
and doesn't take it
to her core.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.071
What mother would give up
even the slightest chance

23:25.113 --> 23:27.323
that it could be possible?

23:29.284 --> 23:32.871
You and I sat
together in his room.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.123
I held your hand.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.002
The reason you didn't call us
with this new information:

23:39.044 --> 23:41.129
you know what
happened to Vincent.

23:42.964 --> 23:46.760
- [scoffs]
- It's not too late to tell me.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.637
- Vincent left for school
Tuesday morning,

23:49.679 --> 23:51.056
and he never came back.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.515
I don't know what happened.

23:52.557 --> 23:56.728
- From the start, I've never
seen hope in your eyes.

23:56.770 --> 24:02.317
Only grief, despair,
resignation.

24:02.359 --> 24:09.282
* *

24:18.917 --> 24:21.294
This is Vincent's
class schedule.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.798
I took it off his desk,
you'll remember.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.257
According to the schedule
for Tuesday,

24:26.299 --> 24:27.759
Vincent should have started
the day

24:27.801 --> 24:31.054
with two hours of calculus,
followed by an hour of PE,

24:31.096 --> 24:34.265
an hour of sociology,
and an hour of literature.

24:36.851 --> 24:37.977
This is a list of the books

24:38.019 --> 24:40.647
that were found
in Vincent's bag.

24:40.689 --> 24:45.402
A civics book, a copy of
"Antigone," a geology text.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.278
No calculus book.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.572
It seems he packed
the wrong books.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.324
Geology, "Antigone"?

24:51.366 --> 24:53.243
Those were classes
from last semester.

24:55.036 --> 24:57.580
- I suppose he didn't have
any real intention

24:57.622 --> 24:59.165
of going to school that day.

24:59.207 --> 25:02.043
- And if he was running away,
best to take his geology text?

25:02.085 --> 25:04.045
Why take any schoolbooks?

25:05.630 --> 25:09.426
Someone other than Vincent
packed that bag.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.387
Someone who didn't know
his schedule.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.767
Was it you?

25:17.809 --> 25:19.936
- No.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.856
- Was it your husband?

25:22.897 --> 25:28.028
* *

25:28.069 --> 25:30.155
This is your son.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.614
This is also your last chance.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.366
- [exhales]

25:36.953 --> 25:38.204
I don't know what happened.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.791
He--he left, I thought,
for school.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.002
And he never came back.

25:48.631 --> 25:51.051
- We found Vincent's body.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.261
- What the fuck?

25:54.763 --> 25:56.806
- [gasps]

25:56.848 --> 25:59.059
- I would be sorry to have
to inform you that he is dead.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.894
But you already know this.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.438
- [mouths silently]

26:03.480 --> 26:05.523
- If there are
mitigating circumstances, Nora,

26:05.565 --> 26:07.067
now would be the time.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.569
- [exhales]

26:09.611 --> 26:11.988
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.537
- When your husband lands
at La Guardia,

26:19.579 --> 26:21.122
he'll be arrested.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.041
He'll then be told
that you informed us

26:23.083 --> 26:24.668
as to what happened.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.045
He will then likely give us
his version,

26:27.087 --> 26:30.090
one I suspect puts him in
the most favorable light.

26:32.008 --> 26:35.220
You have a daughter.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.139
Your best hope at getting
to continue to be her mother

26:38.181 --> 26:41.810
is to get your version
out first.

26:41.851 --> 26:48.608
* *

26:50.068 --> 26:51.277
We know they argued

26:51.319 --> 26:53.655
when Leonard came back
early from dinner.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.490
The neighbors heard it.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.079
What was that argument about?

27:02.330 --> 27:05.166
- [chuckles weakly, sniffles]

27:09.963 --> 27:13.049
[sighs]

27:14.092 --> 27:17.679
Leon--

27:17.721 --> 27:19.931
Leonard came home.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.808
And, uh...

27:21.850 --> 27:28.565
* *

27:28.606 --> 27:32.068
He walked in on--

27:32.110 --> 27:33.987
on Vincent and Olivia.

27:34.029 --> 27:39.284
* *

27:39.325 --> 27:43.705
Vincent was in her room...

27:43.747 --> 27:45.582
gratifying himself.

27:45.623 --> 27:49.127
* *

27:49.169 --> 27:52.088
[sniffling]

27:52.130 --> 27:54.716
Leonard saw it. He--

27:54.758 --> 27:57.552
he walked in,
and he saw him.

27:58.219 --> 28:01.556
He lost it.
He just--he lost control.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.768
- No!
[grunts]

28:04.809 --> 28:06.686
[Olivia screams]

28:07.896 --> 28:10.065
- And then I came home, and--

28:10.106 --> 28:11.566
and he was dead already.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.443
He was lying there
on the floor

28:13.485 --> 28:15.445
with his eyes open, but he--

28:15.487 --> 28:18.698
there was nothing there.
He...

28:18.740 --> 28:24.287
* *

28:24.329 --> 28:27.082
- And what did you do?

28:29.084 --> 28:30.627
- I hugged him.

28:33.672 --> 28:35.840
[sobs]
I hugged him.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.259
I just went down on the floor,
and I hugged him.

28:38.301 --> 28:41.221
* *

28:41.262 --> 28:44.224
And Leonard--
[sighs]

28:44.265 --> 28:48.186
Leonard was convinced
that he'd go to jail

28:48.228 --> 28:50.230
and that they would take
Olivia away from us.

28:50.271 --> 28:54.776
So we decided
to make it seem like--

28:54.818 --> 28:57.612
like he ran away, he was--

28:57.654 --> 28:59.447
[exhales]

29:02.826 --> 29:04.577
- And the body?

29:06.663 --> 29:10.041
- Leonard took him out
in the middle of the night.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.710
[sobs weakly]

29:13.128 --> 29:15.797
- Took him out how?

29:18.091 --> 29:19.801
- But if you--you--

29:19.843 --> 29:22.470
you found him,
you knew, obviously.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.852
- The large suitcase.

31:23.383 --> 31:26.803
to our onsite reporter
with an update from the scene.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.263
- Tragic news
out of Brooklyn

31:28.304 --> 31:31.057
in the disappearance
of minor Vincent Conte,

31:31.099 --> 31:32.475
whose body was retrieved

31:32.517 --> 31:35.437
this evening from
the bottom of the East River.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.814
The grisly discovery
made by NYPD

31:37.856 --> 31:40.567
after the parents
of the victim confessed

31:40.608 --> 31:43.153
to the accidental killing
of their son,

31:43.194 --> 31:45.363
then disposing of the body.

31:45.405 --> 31:46.781
- Officials

31:46.823 --> 31:48.199
at the Environmental
Protection Agency...

32:00.211 --> 32:03.548
- [sighs] I need a beer.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.967
- I don't have any.

32:06.009 --> 32:09.346
- Well, then we have
to go to a bar.

32:09.387 --> 32:11.181
- Okay.

[light piano music]

32:14.184 --> 32:21.066

32:21.107 --> 32:24.235
- And the sister maintains
that nothing happened.

32:24.277 --> 32:27.072
The psychologist thinks she's
either protecting Vincent,

32:27.113 --> 32:29.866
or, more likely,
she's blocking it out.

32:29.908 --> 32:32.994
[upbeat rock music playing]

32:34.537 --> 32:38.083
You okay?

32:38.124 --> 32:39.834
- I felt I knew him.

32:39.876 --> 32:45.131
That's... not the boy I knew.

32:45.173 --> 32:49.678
- Professionally speaking, Avi,
today was a really good day.

32:49.719 --> 32:51.137
You broke the case.

32:51.179 --> 32:52.389
- I misread everything.

32:52.430 --> 32:54.140
- No.

32:54.182 --> 32:56.309
You misread her.

32:56.351 --> 32:58.103
Everything else,
you were spot on.

32:58.144 --> 33:02.148
I mean, the father, that it
happened in the building.

33:02.190 --> 33:04.818
But you did misread her.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.201
- Is the point of this beer
to critique me?

33:13.243 --> 33:16.830
- Would you like me to?

33:16.871 --> 33:19.416
- Yes.

33:19.457 --> 33:23.628
- Okay, well, as I said,

33:23.670 --> 33:26.256
gold star
for breaking the case.

33:26.297 --> 33:31.553
Um, your drawings turned out
to be more accurate than not.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.972
- But?

33:34.014 --> 33:38.143
- You--you lost your way some.

33:38.184 --> 33:42.313
You believed in her
a little bit too hard.

33:42.355 --> 33:45.650
You got to the truth,
due in part to your compass,

33:45.692 --> 33:49.070
but also in spite of it.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.823
I mean, it's a truth
that's devastated you,

33:51.865 --> 33:53.616
not just because
Vincent's dead,

33:53.658 --> 33:56.327
but because this woman
you desperately wanted

33:56.369 --> 33:58.246
to be innocent

33:58.288 --> 34:00.540
turned out not to be.

34:02.292 --> 34:05.879
- I think it should be me
who learns from you.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.298
- Maybe we learn
from each other.

34:11.468 --> 34:15.055
- L'chaim.

You're okay.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.003
[baby babbling]
Yeah.

34:51.299 --> 34:53.551
- I suppose you've come
to apologize.

34:53.593 --> 34:55.845
[baby crying]
- For?

34:57.555 --> 34:59.724
- For--for everything.

34:59.766 --> 35:02.268
My innocence, to start with.

35:04.562 --> 35:05.980
And you know what?

35:06.022 --> 35:08.692
For being right
about everything that I wrote,

35:08.733 --> 35:10.777
which was excellent writing,
by the way,

35:10.819 --> 35:12.696
so much so that
I caused my own wife

35:12.737 --> 35:14.197
to believe every word of it,

35:14.239 --> 35:16.199
which occasioned her to give
my materials to the Contes,

35:16.241 --> 35:19.411
which occasioned you to lay
a trap and solve the case.

35:20.328 --> 35:22.497
For all your investigating,
it was the power of my writing

35:22.539 --> 35:25.041
that actually led to the break.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.043
- Perhaps, in addition
to an apology,

35:27.085 --> 35:29.963
I should offer my gratitude.

35:31.798 --> 35:34.509
- You are a--

35:34.551 --> 35:38.096
an arrogant man in sheep's
clothing is what you are.

35:38.138 --> 35:40.306
- That would not be
the metaphor I'd expect

35:40.348 --> 35:43.309
from an excellent writer.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.648
- You know what
I'm working on now?

35:48.690 --> 35:51.192
- What?
- A poem.

35:51.234 --> 35:54.654
It's going to be called "And
He Walked Away with Dignity."

35:54.696 --> 35:56.531
Which is what I'm
going to do right now.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.283
I'm going to walk away
from you.

35:59.534 --> 36:01.619
Come on, Luke.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.621
Let's go play on the swings,

36:03.663 --> 36:07.167
away from this nasty man, okay?

36:07.208 --> 36:08.752
Yeah.

Leonard and Nora.

my neighbors back.

- For now.

36:26.394 --> 36:28.772
How are you and Zack doing?

36:28.813 --> 36:32.400
- Oh...

36:32.442 --> 36:34.361
- That well, huh?

36:34.402 --> 36:38.907
- Still don't feel
like I know who he is.

36:38.948 --> 36:41.868
Not completely.

36:41.910 --> 36:43.661
Of course, I'm having
trouble trusting myself

36:43.703 --> 36:48.166
to trust or know anybody.

36:48.208 --> 36:52.128
But I guess that can happen
when the world shifts

36:52.170 --> 36:54.506
too much beneath your feet.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.257
- It can.

36:58.843 --> 37:01.096
- I'll tell you this, though.

37:01.137 --> 37:06.184
While I can't claim to truly
have known Vincent Conte,

37:06.226 --> 37:11.523
I sensed him, and I felt him
through and through.

37:11.564 --> 37:14.984
And what they're saying
about him and his sister?

37:15.026 --> 37:17.737
Not a fucking chance.

37:17.779 --> 37:19.572
It was not within that boy
to do

37:19.614 --> 37:21.700
what he's being accused of.

37:21.741 --> 37:23.159
- Leonard saw it.

37:23.201 --> 37:27.122
He walked in
on Vincent and Olivia.

37:27.163 --> 37:29.874
- Not a fucking chance.

37:29.916 --> 37:31.292
- I need to speak
to your daughter.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.544
- Why?

37:32.585 --> 37:35.046
- It would be helpful
to the investigation.

37:35.088 --> 37:38.258
- Well, I would need
to be present.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.011
- The psychologists think she's
either protecting Vincent...

37:41.052 --> 37:43.221
- No!
[grunts]

37:43.263 --> 37:44.472
[Olivia screams]

37:44.514 --> 37:46.891
- Or, more likely,
she's blocking it out.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.236

37:58.278 --> 38:00.321
- I came to brief you
on some closing details.

38:00.363 --> 38:02.240
We also have
a few follow-up questions.

38:02.282 --> 38:04.492
- Are you kidding me?
I'm represented by counsel.

38:04.534 --> 38:07.370
- It's just to fill you in
on a few things.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.207
- [sighs]

38:15.045 --> 38:16.671
Olivia, why don't you go to
your room for a second,

38:16.713 --> 38:17.881
Okay, hon?

38:17.922 --> 38:19.007
- Actually,
it's fine that she hears.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.884
It's probably best, even.

38:22.635 --> 38:25.138
First, I again want to convey
my sympathies

38:25.180 --> 38:30.602
for these very difficult
circumstances to lose a child,

38:30.643 --> 38:32.854
to discover that your child
had been inappropriate

38:32.896 --> 38:34.105
with his sibling.
- Yeah, what are these

38:34.147 --> 38:37.108
closing details, please?

38:37.150 --> 38:41.446
- Mainly that our discovery
was inaccurate.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.907
The discovery
that Vincent was inappropriate

38:43.948 --> 38:47.452
with his sibling?

38:47.494 --> 38:49.287
He wasn't.

38:49.329 --> 38:50.580
- What the hell
are you talking about?

38:50.622 --> 38:51.790
I saw it.
- Yes.

38:51.831 --> 38:55.335
We have your word
that you saw it.

38:55.377 --> 38:59.255
Are you able to reconcile
who you knew Vincent to be

38:59.297 --> 39:01.549
just with your husband's word?

39:01.591 --> 39:04.511
[tense music]

39:04.552 --> 39:06.346
- What's going on?

39:06.388 --> 39:08.556
* *

39:08.598 --> 39:10.141
- I'm told we still have yet

39:10.183 --> 39:11.935
to get
your word on this, Olivia.

39:11.976 --> 39:13.144
- You are out of line.

39:13.186 --> 39:15.021
- What's going on?

39:15.063 --> 39:16.898
- Perhaps you've
blocked out the memory,

39:16.940 --> 39:18.316
as the psychologists suggest.

39:18.358 --> 39:20.026
- You need to get the hell
out of this house

39:20.068 --> 39:21.277
right now.
- What is going on?

39:21.319 --> 39:23.029
- Our daughter's been
traumatized enough.

39:23.071 --> 39:25.824
- Yes.
My question is by who.

39:25.865 --> 39:27.992
- What is happening here?

39:29.703 --> 39:33.039
- Your husband didn't walk in
on your son with Olivia.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.166
* *

39:35.208 --> 39:38.211
Your son walked in
on your husband.

39:38.253 --> 39:40.797
- That is a fuckin' lie.
- Is it?

39:40.839 --> 39:45.510
* *

39:45.552 --> 39:46.928
- Oh, my God.

39:46.970 --> 39:49.931
Olivia. Stop.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.683
Olivia, you tell me the truth.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.268
- [chuckles]

39:53.309 --> 39:55.395
- Okay, tell me the truth.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.188
* *

39:57.230 --> 40:00.525
Olivia, honey. It's okay.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.819
Olivia, honey.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.572
Tell me the truth.

40:05.613 --> 40:09.868
* *

40:09.909 --> 40:11.411
Oh, my God.

40:11.453 --> 40:13.455
* *

40:13.496 --> 40:15.206
- It's a lie.
It's fuckin' bullshit.

40:15.248 --> 40:16.458
- Where do you
think you're going?

40:16.499 --> 40:18.209
- Fuck off. I'm calling
my lawyer right now.

40:18.251 --> 40:20.420
- Leonard.
I wasn't quite finished.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.213
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to re-arrest you.

40:22.255 --> 40:23.965
[cocks gun]
- He's got a gun!

40:24.007 --> 40:25.592
- Leonard.

40:25.633 --> 40:28.094
[intense music]

40:34.768 --> 40:36.186
- Nora, please take Olivia to
her room and stay there now.

40:36.227 --> 40:37.896
This is not how you
want it to end, Leonard.

40:37.937 --> 40:39.564
- Well, what about this ending?
Do you like this ending?

40:39.606 --> 40:40.732
- Drop that fuckin' gun!
- Do you like this ending?

40:40.774 --> 40:41.691
- Let's stay calm.
- Drop the fuckin' gun

40:41.733 --> 40:42.817
- Let's stay calm!
- Shut up!

40:42.859 --> 40:44.361
- Nobody here wants
anybody to die.

40:44.402 --> 40:45.653
- Shut the fuck up.
- Avi--

40:45.695 --> 40:47.113
- You are not
a homicidal person.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.615
- Stop. Stop talking.
- We all know

40:48.656 --> 40:49.949
what happened with Vincent.
You didn't mean to kill him.

40:49.991 --> 40:50.992
- Just shut the fuck up.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.202
- It happened in an instant.

40:52.243 --> 40:53.411
- Leonard,
drop the fucking gun.

40:53.453 --> 40:55.163
- Shut up!
- Avi.

40:55.205 --> 40:56.373
- He initiated
the confrontation.

40:56.414 --> 40:57.874
- I said shut up!
- There's no malice

40:57.916 --> 41:00.085
in your heart.
- You're not gonna fuckin'

41:00.126 --> 41:02.045
talk me down with clever.

41:02.087 --> 41:03.588
[grunting]

41:16.309 --> 41:23.441
* *

41:32.242 --> 41:34.994
- You okay?
- That is not the way, Avi.

41:35.036 --> 41:36.788
Taking on armed suspects
like that.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.040
It is not sustainable.

41:39.082 --> 41:41.835
- I damn near killed the guy.

41:41.876 --> 41:43.670
- We're all fine.

41:43.712 --> 41:50.677
* *

41:54.723 --> 41:55.682
- [knocks]

42:03.857 --> 42:05.358
I'm sorry.

42:07.861 --> 42:10.196
- Please just go.

42:11.948 --> 42:18.872
* *

42:25.378 --> 42:28.381
- Let's give them
a little longer together.

42:28.423 --> 42:31.217
- She knew.

42:31.259 --> 42:33.762
Nora knew.

42:35.513 --> 42:39.059
- At some level, she knew.
Yes.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.603
[clears throat]

42:41.644 --> 42:44.564
- Can we just get
five more minutes?

42:46.024 --> 42:47.400
- [exhales]

42:47.442 --> 42:54.574

42:58.912 --> 43:02.290
- Dad?

[Olivia screams]

43:05.752 --> 43:08.213
