08:29.910 --> 08:30.911
(scoffs)

08:30.911 --> 08:32.813
YOU'RE WELCOME, MARY SUNSHINE.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.014
(sighs, clicks keyboard key)

08:34.014 --> 08:36.015
(Tom)
TODAY I AM JUST GRATEFUL

08:36.015 --> 08:38.087
THAT JUSTICE PREVAILED

08:38.087 --> 08:40.090
AND THAT THIS TERRIBLE MAN
HAS BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE

08:40.090 --> 08:42.152
FOR HIS CRIMES
AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

08:42.152 --> 08:45.696
AS FOR THE FUTURE,
I HAVE ALWAYS PLANNED

08:45.696 --> 08:46.997
TO SERVE MY COUNTRY

08:46.997 --> 08:50.060
HOWEVER AND WHEREVER
IT NEEDS ME MOST.

08:50.060 --> 08:56.066
(reporters shouting
indistinctly)

09:08.018 --> 09:10.120
(footsteps approach)

09:10.120 --> 09:12.683
DO YOU LIKE
THE NECKLACE?

09:12.683 --> 09:14.184
WHAT WOMAN WOULDN'T?

09:14.184 --> 09:15.956
I'M JUST CURIOUS
AS TO WHY

09:15.956 --> 09:18.028
YOU'RE ANGRIER TODAY
THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY.

09:18.028 --> 09:20.030
BECAUSE YESTERDAY,
I DIDN'T HAVE A HOUSE

09:20.030 --> 09:21.832
FULL OF UNWANTED GUESTS.

09:21.832 --> 09:23.664
WEAR THE TEAL.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.297
FINE. YOU DON'T LIKE
TOM'S POLITICS.

09:27.297 --> 09:29.299
OH, I COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT HIS POLITICS.

09:29.299 --> 09:30.901
IT'S HIM I DON'T LIKE.

09:30.901 --> 09:32.572
WELL, HE'S DONE MORE FOR US
THAN WE'LL EVER

09:32.572 --> 09:34.044
BE ABLE TO DO FOR HIM.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.676
HOW COULD I EVER FORGET?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.907
COME ON.

09:36.907 --> 09:38.709
THIS WILL ALL BE OVER
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

09:38.709 --> 09:40.050
AND THEN...

09:40.050 --> 09:42.352
WE CAN GO TO PARIS
FOR A FEW DAYS, YOU KNOW?

09:42.352 --> 09:44.054
WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

09:44.054 --> 09:48.158
I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

09:48.158 --> 09:51.361
THEN YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE SLEPT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.332
(clicks keyboard keys)

10:02.332 --> 10:06.006
(beeping)

10:07.808 --> 10:09.309
JUST A SECOND.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.142
(clicks keyboard keys)

10:15.946 --> 10:17.818
HI.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.290
HEY.
OH, YOU LOOK LOVELY.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.192
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE PUNCTUAL.

10:22.192 --> 10:23.323
IS THAT A BAD THING?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.226
NO, NOT AT ALL.
I'LL JUST GRAB MY STUFF.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.312
ALL SET.

10:45.676 --> 10:47.978
WELL, AREN'T YOU
FULL OF SURPRISES?

10:47.978 --> 10:50.080
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I LIVE ALONE.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.922
WE SHOULD
GO SHOOTING SOMETIME.

10:51.922 --> 10:53.954
WE DEFINITELY SHOULD.

10:56.887 --> 10:58.228
SHALL WE?

10:58.228 --> 11:00.791
WE SHALL.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.062
(Jack) MY DAD ALWAYS SAID

11:02.062 --> 11:04.364
THAT AN EMPTY BAR
IS A SAD BAR.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.037
HE'D BE HAPPY TO SEE
YOU ALL HERE TODAY.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.368
HE MIGHT NOT
HAVE WANTED A FUNERAL,

11:08.368 --> 11:10.070
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A WAKE,

11:10.070 --> 11:12.042
SO, EVERYBODY, DRINK UP.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.744
TO CARL PORTER.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.405
(all) TO CARL PORTER.

11:15.405 --> 11:17.908
AND, UH, IN HONOR OF
JACK AND DECLAN'S FATHER,

11:17.908 --> 11:20.380
NEXT ROUND'S ON ME.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.252
(all cheer)

11:22.252 --> 11:25.385
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY DAD.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.017
NO, BUT...

11:27.017 --> 11:29.720
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S
A--HE'S A GOOD GUY--

11:29.720 --> 11:33.193
ALL THESE PEOPLE
DRINKING HERE TO HONOR HIM.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.266
WHEN MY DAD BITES IT, PEOPLE
WILL BE DRINKING TO CELEBRATE.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.729
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU,
MAN?

11:38.729 --> 11:40.731
UH, YOU KNOW TO MAKE
A MALIBU BAY BREEZE?

11:40.731 --> 11:42.072
I DO.

11:42.072 --> 11:44.735
I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE
AGAINST IT.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.907
IT'S MORE OF A WHISKEY
AND BEER CROWD.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.238
WELL...

11:48.238 --> 11:51.141
(clears throat)
WHEN IN ROME...

11:51.141 --> 11:53.944

11:53.944 --> 11:56.186
AH, HEY, SPORTY.

11:56.186 --> 11:58.418
WHOSE FIST

11:58.418 --> 12:01.251
OH, SOME RICH JERKWAD.

12:01.251 --> 12:03.954
THERE'S A LOT OF 'EM AROUND
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

12:03.954 --> 12:05.796
YOU, UH, PLANNING ON
GETTING EVEN?

12:05.796 --> 12:07.297
CONSIDERING
I'M HALF THE GUY'S SIZE

12:07.297 --> 12:08.799
WITH HALF THE FRIENDS,

12:08.799 --> 12:10.000
NO.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.833
VIOLENCE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO TAKE SOMEONE DOWN.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.435
(indistinct conversations)

12:15.435 --> 12:17.267
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.

12:17.267 --> 12:19.339
THE FAMILY VALUES CROWD
WOULD EAT THAT UP.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.771
WELL, THEN HERE'S TO
FAMILY VALUES.

12:20.771 --> 12:23.473
(clears throat) AND THE PASSAGE
OF THE KINGSLY FINANCE BILL.

12:23.473 --> 12:25.175
WHEN I'M REELECTED,

12:25.175 --> 12:27.277
IT'S MY FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS.

12:27.277 --> 12:28.418
ALL THIS TALK OF POLITICS.

12:28.418 --> 12:29.780
(all laugh)

12:29.780 --> 12:31.421
BELIEVE ME,
I'M USED TO IT.

12:31.421 --> 12:34.454
WHAT A LOVELY NECKLACE,

13:07.457 --> 13:10.090
(Steve) OH, MAN.
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.062
FIND OUT
WHERE THIS CAME FROM.

13:12.062 --> 13:13.463
NOW.

13:21.531 --> 13:25.535
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
SENATOR?

13:25.535 --> 13:28.438

13:30.540 --> 13:31.811

13:31.811 --> 13:34.384
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
LOOKS INTERESTING.

13:34.384 --> 13:37.988
IT'S AN ITALIAN STEAK HOUSE.
ASHLEY TURNED ME ON TO IT.

13:37.988 --> 13:40.991

13:43.193 --> 13:45.325
RED LEATHER BOOTHS

13:49.199 --> 13:51.301
MORE SUSHI BAR

EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.673

FOR WHAT YOU DID,

15:03.673 --> 15:05.305
YOU WOULDN'T BE APOLOGIZING

15:46.946 --> 15:49.179
OH, MORE POLITICS,
I'M AFRAID.

15:49.179 --> 15:51.721
AH. TROUBLE WITH
THE MAJORITY LEADER?

15:51.721 --> 15:53.553
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BORE YOU WITH THIS.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.989
DAVID CLARKE IS INNOCENT,
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

15:58.989 --> 16:00.991
TELL THE JUDGE AND HAVE HIM
CALL BACK THE JURY.

16:00.991 --> 16:02.732
THEY'RE ALREADY
IN DELIBERATIONS.

16:02.732 --> 16:05.065
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME,
YOU COMMITTED PERJURY?

16:05.065 --> 16:07.637

SHE'S IN LOVE WITH HIM.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.699
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

16:09.699 --> 16:11.701
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS,
YOU'VE JUST ARGUED

16:11.701 --> 16:14.204
AN AIRTIGHT CASE AGAINST
THE MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA,

16:14.204 --> 16:16.446
AND WHEN THE JURY CONVICTS HIM,

16:16.446 --> 16:18.448
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN INSTANT NATIONAL HERO.

16:18.448 --> 16:21.111
YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE, TOM,
IS WIDE OPEN,

16:21.111 --> 16:22.982
AND YOU HAVE
A POWERFUL SUPPORTER IN ME.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.186
NOW IF YOU DECIDE
TO LISTEN TO MY WIFE,

16:26.186 --> 16:29.259
WHO'S FOOLISHLY FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH THAT MONSTER,

16:29.259 --> 16:32.692
YOU'RE GONNA THROW
ALL THAT AWAY.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.165
IT'S YOUR CALL.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.034
WHAT'S THE CRISIS?

16:44.034 --> 16:45.205
(Steve) THERE IS NO CRISIS.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.636
JUST A LITTLE SITUATION.

16:46.636 --> 16:48.738
FRANK.

16:48.738 --> 16:50.210
VICTORIA.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.483
YOU AND DIANE GO AHEAD
AND FINISH DINNER WITHOUT US.

16:53.483 --> 16:57.016
IT MIGHT
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.790
REST ASSURED, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF IT.

17:00.790 --> 17:03.093
DON'T YOU ALWAYS?

17:14.164 --> 17:15.805
THANKS.

17:17.607 --> 17:20.170
I'M... I'M SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.811
BUT IN A WAY, I'M ALSO
GLAD IT HAPPENED.

17:22.811 --> 17:25.145
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.776
WELL, WHAT AM I
GETTING INTO?

17:26.776 --> 17:28.278
I MEAN, WHO WAS THAT GUY?

17:28.278 --> 17:29.779
PATRICK MUNELLO.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.781
I DATED HIS SISTER
LAST SUMMER.

17:31.781 --> 17:33.283
HER NAME'S SARA.

17:33.283 --> 17:34.784
SO YOU BREAK
THE SISTER'S HEART,

17:34.784 --> 17:37.227
AND THEN BIG BROTHER
BREAKS YOUR CAR?

17:37.227 --> 17:39.689
ACTUALLY, I BROKE HER SPINE.

17:39.689 --> 17:41.191
OH, MY GOD.

17:41.191 --> 17:43.093
SHE WASN'T PARALYZED,
THANK GOD, BUT, YOU KNOW,

17:43.093 --> 17:45.735
IT'S STILL A STRUGGLE
FOR HER.

17:45.735 --> 17:48.468
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

17:48.468 --> 17:51.571
MY MOM, AS YOU KNOW,
HAS A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.273
HER SON DATING
A COCKTAIL WAITRESS

17:53.273 --> 17:54.444
FROM PORTSMOUTH

17:54.444 --> 17:55.775
NOT ONE OF THEM.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.777
SO TOWARDS THE END
OF THE SUMMER,

17:57.777 --> 18:00.380
MY MOM
MADE HER FEELINGS PUBLIC

18:00.380 --> 18:02.212
AT ONE OF HER PARTIES.

18:02.212 --> 18:05.115
AND I TOOK OFF WITH SARA,
DRUNK.

18:05.115 --> 18:07.317
WRAPPED MY CAR
AROUND A UTILITY POLE,

18:07.317 --> 18:10.290
AND... THEY HAD TO
CUT US BOTH OUT.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.764
SO WHERE IS SHE NOW?

18:14.764 --> 18:17.667
STILL IN REHAB
LAST I HEARD.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.200
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER
SINCE THAT NIGHT.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.202
MY PARENTS COVERED
SARA'S MEDICAL BILLS

18:22.202 --> 18:24.774
AND SET HER UP
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY,

18:24.774 --> 18:26.776
PAID A JUDGE OFF
TO KEEP ME OUT OF JAIL,

18:26.776 --> 18:30.780
AND IN RETURN, I HAD TO SWEAR
I'D NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.213
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU REGRET THAT NOW.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.345
EVERY DAY.

18:37.687 --> 18:40.150
DO YOU THINK
I'M A BAD PERSON?

18:42.722 --> 18:44.624
I THINK...

18:44.624 --> 18:48.658
PEOPLE WHO MAKE MISTAKES
SHOULD OWN UP TO THEM.

18:48.658 --> 18:51.201
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

18:51.201 --> 18:54.764
TELL HER WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME NOW.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.269
WHEN DID THE AFFAIR END?

18:59.269 --> 19:02.272
FEBRUARY,
BUT ON GOOD TERMS.

19:02.272 --> 19:04.374
I DON'T BELIEVE
SHE'D BE BEHIND THIS.

19:04.374 --> 19:06.145
THEN IT CAN BE MANAGED.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.647
IF IT COMES OUT,
YOU BOTH DENY IT.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.649
CANDIDATES SURVIVE
THIS SORT OF THING ALL THE TIME.

19:09.649 --> 19:13.353
YOU'RE NOT TELLING US
THE WHOLE STORY.

19:15.385 --> 19:18.288
(Tom) SHORTLY BEFORE
WE DECIDED TO MOVE ON,

39:43.752 --> 39:44.713
AGAIN.

39:44.713 --> 39:45.714
(chuckles)

39:45.714 --> 39:48.016
(Sammy whines)

39:48.016 --> 39:50.689
SAMMY. (clicks tongue)

39:53.662 --> 39:56.465
COME ON. COME ON.

39:56.465 --> 39:58.697
(motor starts)

40:09.738 --> 40:11.440
(Emily) FOR THE INNOCENT,

40:11.440 --> 40:14.412
THE PAST MAY HOLD A REWARD.

40:18.787 --> 40:20.919
BUT FOR THE TREACHEROUS...

40:20.919 --> 40:23.191
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE PAST DELIVERS

40:23.191 --> 40:25.794
WHAT THEY TRULY DESERVE.

40:28.196 --> 40:30.799
THE KINGSLYS HAVE DECIDED

40:30.799 --> 40:33.602
TO AVOID THE SPOTLIGHT
FOR THE TIME BEING.

40:33.602 --> 40:35.433
THAT'S PROBABLY BEST.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.766
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
I LOCATED THE I.P. ADDRESS

40:37.766 --> 40:39.768
ALL THOSE E-MAILS CAME FROM.

40:39.768 --> 40:41.069
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.642
THE DAMAGE HAS
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.743
THEY CAME FROM RIGHT HERE.

40:46.975 --> 40:49.017
MY LAPTOP?

40:50.479 --> 40:51.950
WELL, I SURE AS HELL
DIDN'T DO IT.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.582
NOT YOU.

40:53.582 --> 40:56.555
SOMEONE WITH REAL MOTIVE

40:56.555 --> 40:58.086
AND ACCESS.

41:05.634 --> 41:07.666
(exhales)

41:07.666 --> 41:09.067
(necklace clatters)

41:19.077 --> 41:21.479
MM.

41:24.813 --> 41:26.915
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.019
(laughs)

41:35.764 --> 41:38.797
(exhales deeply)

41:38.797 --> 41:39.828
(gasps)

41:41.800 --> 41:43.672
I LOVE THEM.
(laughs)

41:43.672 --> 41:45.273
(laughs)

41:45.273 --> 41:47.005
(whispers) HEY.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.777
(normal voice) HEY.

41:48.777 --> 41:50.779
YOU PROMISE ME,
WHEN YOU WEAR THEM,

41:50.779 --> 41:52.581
THAT YOU THINK OF ME.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.846
ALWAYS.

41:57.846 --> 42:00.088
(chuckles)

42:05.854 --> 42:07.856
(whispers) LET ME SEE.

42:07.856 --> 42:09.858
(normal voice)
GOD, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.
