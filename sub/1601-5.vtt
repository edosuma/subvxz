00:00.016 --> 00:02.291
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:02.392 --> 00:04.059
Zane Morgan, I think
you might have forgotten

00:04.160 --> 00:05.394
how things work around here.

00:05.495 --> 00:08.931
I can be a real nice guy till I break you.

00:09.032 --> 00:10.032
Sheriff!

00:10.133 --> 00:11.400
Hold on a second. Yeah?

00:11.501 --> 00:12.935
You got to get over to
your house right away.

00:14.938 --> 00:17.239
Excuse me.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.508
I just haven't met anyone
else against the bypass

00:19.609 --> 00:22.377
and also who seems to know
how things work in this town.

00:23.947 --> 00:25.114
Give me a call.

00:25.215 --> 00:26.615
Hey, I'm looking for Norma Bates.

00:26.716 --> 00:28.550
- Who are you?
- I'm her brother.

00:28.651 --> 00:31.220
- My brother Caleb was here.
- What?

00:31.321 --> 00:33.388
She's lying! Can't you see that?

00:33.490 --> 00:35.124
Norman, stop it!

00:35.225 --> 00:37.993
He can't help it! It's his dad!

00:38.094 --> 00:39.928
Caleb is his dad.

00:40.029 --> 00:41.930
You had sex with my mother.
Did you know I was your son?

00:42.031 --> 00:44.099
You need to be strong. You
need to put this behind you.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.469
I can't put this behind me. It's me.

00:49.072 --> 00:51.006
I came here to tell you

00:51.107 --> 00:53.242
that I remember what you did to me,

00:53.343 --> 00:54.409
you son of a bitch!

00:54.511 --> 00:56.159
Don't lie again!

00:57.679 --> 01:01.316
Norman, it's me, Cody. Can you hear me?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:10.493 --> 01:11.609
Norman?

01:14.864 --> 01:15.940
Norman?

01:20.603 --> 01:22.100
Norman.

01:24.307 --> 01:25.707
Hey.

01:25.808 --> 01:27.600
You're back.

01:28.611 --> 01:31.947
I didn't want to drop you off
until I was sure you were okay.

01:33.015 --> 01:34.752
What happened?

01:36.319 --> 01:38.386
You were about a mile east of Eagle Creek.

01:38.488 --> 01:42.525
You were just in a coffee shop
down the road just zoning out.

01:42.575 --> 01:45.460
The manager called me, so here we are.

01:47.430 --> 01:50.699
Call... why... why would
they... why would they call you?

01:55.905 --> 01:57.939
Do you remember anything?

01:58.040 --> 02:00.375
I've never seen anyone
go into a hole like that.

02:00.476 --> 02:02.811
I mean, you were, like, not there.

02:02.912 --> 02:04.813
You take something?

02:04.914 --> 02:07.782
No, I... no, I didn't.

02:07.884 --> 02:09.851
Okay.

02:09.952 --> 02:12.848
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.359
Never.

02:19.996 --> 02:21.263
Did anyone call my mother?

02:21.364 --> 02:23.231
No, they just called me.

02:23.332 --> 02:25.534
They had no one else to call.

02:25.635 --> 02:28.270
Well, please don't tell her.

02:28.371 --> 02:30.639
Well, no, she'll just worry and, uh...

02:30.740 --> 02:34.539
You never have to worry about
me telling sh... to parents.

02:50.860 --> 02:53.361
What the hell?

02:54.830 --> 02:55.730
What?

02:55.831 --> 02:58.366
Why are you sleeping here?

02:58.467 --> 02:59.501
What are you doing, man?

02:59.602 --> 03:00.702
I'm trying to be unconscious.

03:00.803 --> 03:02.807
Why are you pouring water on me?

03:04.874 --> 03:07.175
See the 2,000 texts right here,

03:07.276 --> 03:09.244
all from me?

03:09.345 --> 03:10.812
What's the crisis?

03:10.913 --> 03:13.782
Someone set Romero's
house on fire last night.

03:13.883 --> 03:16.151
What?

03:16.252 --> 03:18.653
Yeah, it's major.

03:20.456 --> 03:22.357
Are you sure it wasn't an accident?

03:22.458 --> 03:25.827
Word is, it was set. Hmm.

03:25.928 --> 03:27.829
Now, who do you think
would be crazy nuts enough

03:27.930 --> 03:30.899
to mess with Romero?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.467
Huh?

03:32.568 --> 03:35.303
Anyone particular come to mind?

03:41.677 --> 03:42.777
What are we gonna do?

03:42.878 --> 03:46.881
You tell me.

03:46.983 --> 03:49.017
You're the boss.

03:58.945 --> 04:00.512
Morning.

04:00.613 --> 04:03.415
Hi, honey. Sit down. I'm
making scrambled eggs.

04:03.516 --> 04:05.143
Have you talked to Dylan yet?

04:06.686 --> 04:08.121
Dylan moved out.

04:09.522 --> 04:11.189
How do you mean?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.659
He moved out. He's not
gonna live here anymore.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.694
What kind of toast do you want, sweetie?

04:15.795 --> 04:17.228
Shouldn't we go after him?

04:17.329 --> 04:18.497
Shouldn't we try and do something?

04:18.598 --> 04:21.199
There's nothing we can do!

04:24.237 --> 04:25.704
Okay, mother.

04:34.681 --> 04:36.348
It's you and me, Norman.

04:36.449 --> 04:39.551
It's always been you and
me, and we have to move on.

05:19.213 --> 05:20.664
Why are you here?

05:22.886 --> 05:25.430
Might want to rework your
greeting for your guests.

05:25.831 --> 05:27.315
Need a room.

05:27.352 --> 05:29.735
Why do you need a room?

05:31.570 --> 05:34.174
Need a credit card, right?

05:34.807 --> 05:36.541
- What happened?
- Can we just check me in?

05:36.642 --> 05:39.265
- I really don't want to talk about it.
- Okay, fine.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.090
How long will you be staying?

05:41.909 --> 05:44.582
Uh, just... a while probably.

05:44.684 --> 05:46.270
I don't know... a few months.

05:48.854 --> 05:50.021
Somebody torched my house.

05:50.122 --> 05:51.656
They burned it down to the ground.

05:51.757 --> 05:53.491
- Now can I check in?
- They torched your house?

05:53.592 --> 05:56.194
- Yeah.
- Your house?

05:56.295 --> 05:58.697
Sheriff Romero, the big
daddy of White Pine Bay?

05:58.798 --> 06:01.032
I mean, what kind of crazy
lunatic would torch your house?

06:01.133 --> 06:02.767
- Yeah, good question.
- I mean, if I had torched

06:02.868 --> 06:04.602
your house, I'd be getting
the hell out of town,

06:04.704 --> 06:06.703
'cause I'd figure you'd
be coming for my ass.

06:07.773 --> 06:10.709
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Can I just check in?

06:18.884 --> 06:20.919
Room 11.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.522
Maid service is usually around noon.

06:24.623 --> 06:26.858
Any special requests?

06:26.959 --> 06:28.960
Privacy.

06:43.809 --> 06:45.443
Nick Ford's office.

06:45.544 --> 06:48.880
Yes, hello. I'd like to
speak with Nick Ford, please.

06:48.981 --> 06:50.448
Who's calling?

06:50.549 --> 06:52.050
Um, I'm Norma Bates.

06:52.151 --> 06:53.485
I own the Bates Motel.

06:53.586 --> 06:55.420
I met Mr. Ford at a party.

06:55.521 --> 06:59.991
He gave me his card, and we're
supposed to discuss something.

07:00.092 --> 07:01.593
Please hold.

07:07.967 --> 07:08.967
Hello, Norma Bates.

07:09.068 --> 07:12.437
Hi. Hello. Yes. Thank
you for taking my call.

07:12.538 --> 07:15.507
Well, I've actually been
waiting for you to call.

07:15.608 --> 07:18.109
I've been thinking about what we
talked about at the valet stand,

07:18.210 --> 07:20.512
and I have some ideas.

07:20.613 --> 07:22.380
You do? Ideas... great.

07:22.481 --> 07:25.583
Um, when can we get together?
Can I meet you somewhere?

07:25.684 --> 07:28.553
Well, how about you come down to my boat?

07:28.654 --> 07:30.722
Boat? Okay.

07:30.823 --> 07:32.824
It's at the Deep Cove Yacht Club.

07:32.925 --> 07:34.726
Just go down to the main gate

07:34.827 --> 07:37.562
on the docks at 2:30 and dial 4-8-1-6.

07:37.663 --> 07:39.831
Dial 4-8-1-6. Okay, got it.

07:39.932 --> 07:41.933
- I'll see you then.
- See you.

07:49.241 --> 07:50.642
Hey.

07:50.743 --> 07:52.110
I didn't know you were working today.

07:52.211 --> 07:53.611
Oh, I'm not.

07:53.712 --> 07:56.080
I'm just passing the time before tech.

07:56.182 --> 07:59.651
Oh.

07:59.752 --> 08:01.920
Yeah.

08:02.021 --> 08:03.988
Got to meet Cody in a little while.

08:04.089 --> 08:06.090
How's Dylan?

08:06.192 --> 08:09.027
- Dylan moved out.
- What?

08:11.197 --> 08:13.765
My mom and him... they've
never really gotten along.

08:13.866 --> 08:16.434
You know, they had a big fight.

08:16.535 --> 08:18.369
Anyway, it doesn't really
matter what it's about, right?

08:18.470 --> 08:19.771
It's just something that can't be fixed,

08:19.872 --> 08:21.506
and we have to accept it.

08:21.607 --> 08:25.143
What could possibly happen
that couldn't be fixed?

08:26.512 --> 08:29.080
- Hey, you.
- Hello.

08:29.181 --> 08:30.682
Anything we can do for you today?

08:30.783 --> 08:31.983
No, I'm good.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.118
So what do you like to do after work?

08:34.220 --> 08:38.722
Um, usually I...

08:38.823 --> 08:40.592
Usually I-I just go home.

08:40.693 --> 08:43.695
Yeah, that's, uh... that's not gonna work.

08:43.796 --> 08:45.096
Let me put it this way...

08:45.197 --> 08:48.833
What are we doing after work tonight?

08:50.569 --> 08:54.105
We could take a walk down by the beach.

08:54.206 --> 08:56.474
Okay, that sounds good. What time you done?

08:56.575 --> 08:59.043
- Around 5:00.
- Okay, cool.

08:59.144 --> 09:02.914
Well, you can pick me up
at my place just down there.

09:03.015 --> 09:04.916
It's that door right there.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.685
- Yeah, I-I remember.
- All right.

09:13.826 --> 09:15.960
- He sells pot, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.662
- Okay, okay.
- I'm not marrying him.

09:17.763 --> 09:19.764
He's here for the summer, and he's nice.

09:19.865 --> 09:22.786
- He sells pot.
- Nobody's perfect.

09:23.736 --> 09:27.872
And look, it's Cody Brennen.

09:41.987 --> 09:44.789
Hey.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.759
Norman, did you remember the handsaw?

09:47.860 --> 09:50.461
No. I'll... I'll be right back, okay?

09:50.562 --> 09:51.796
Hold on. I'll be back.

09:58.070 --> 09:59.170
- Who is that?
- Cody.

09:59.271 --> 10:00.672
We're doing tech together.

10:00.773 --> 10:02.106
She's just giving me a ride, okay?

10:02.207 --> 10:04.212
I'm getting a saw. I'll be right back.

10:05.711 --> 10:07.145
I'll be right back!

10:17.923 --> 10:19.891
Hello. I'm Norman's mother.

10:19.992 --> 10:21.926
How about that?

10:22.027 --> 10:24.595
- Excuse me?
- I said, "how about that?"

10:24.697 --> 10:27.598
That you're Norman's mom. That's awesome.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.734
I'm super excited.

10:31.937 --> 10:33.571
And you are?

10:33.672 --> 10:35.039
Cody.

10:35.140 --> 10:39.077
- Do you have a last name?
- Brennen.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.681
Well, can you turn down your radio?

10:43.782 --> 10:45.516
This is my motel.

10:45.617 --> 10:47.518
I'd like it to be a peaceful
experience for my guests.

10:47.619 --> 10:49.854
You got it.

10:49.955 --> 10:52.690
Better go.

10:52.791 --> 10:55.626
Got a lot to do.

10:57.162 --> 10:59.931
Later, Mrs. Bates.

11:09.997 --> 11:11.263
So...

11:11.817 --> 11:13.683
You met my mom.

11:13.818 --> 11:15.986
Yeah.

11:16.087 --> 11:18.589
She's a piece of work. Holy crap!

11:22.093 --> 11:23.260
I'm sorry.

11:23.361 --> 11:25.296
I keep forgetting you like your mom.

11:25.397 --> 11:27.231
It's cool.

11:27.332 --> 11:30.868
I'm pretty sure you're gonna
get an earful about me, though.

11:32.937 --> 11:34.872
Damn it.

11:34.973 --> 11:36.640
What?

11:38.710 --> 11:40.277
I forgot the money the producer gave me

11:40.378 --> 11:41.879
for lumber at my house.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.782
Can't we just swing on by and get it?

11:48.219 --> 11:50.054
Sure.

11:50.155 --> 11:53.057
Yeah, I guess we'll have to.

11:54.659 --> 11:56.226
I'm gonna be out for a few hours, Emma.

11:56.328 --> 11:59.997
Can you handle the desk? Sure.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.899
Norma, can I ask you something?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.901
- Sure. What?
- It might seem a little weird.

12:04.002 --> 12:08.572
And I wouldn't ask you except
I have no one else to ask.

12:08.673 --> 12:10.607
What?

12:12.977 --> 12:15.245
What's it like the first time you have sex?

12:21.886 --> 12:23.253
Um...

12:23.355 --> 12:24.788
Why?

12:24.889 --> 12:28.092
Well, there's someone that I met,

12:28.193 --> 12:30.761
and every time I'm with him,

12:30.862 --> 12:32.596
that's pretty much all I'm thinking about,

12:32.697 --> 12:34.365
so it seems in the realm of possibility

12:34.367 --> 12:36.266
that it could happen

12:36.368 --> 12:40.270
and, I mean, because
of my medical situation,

12:40.372 --> 12:42.106
I've never done it.

12:42.207 --> 12:44.608
And I don't have a mother
to ask or a close girlfriend,

12:44.709 --> 12:46.110
and I can't exactly ask my dad.

12:46.211 --> 12:49.213
I-I tried googling it, but
what I read just scared me.

12:49.314 --> 12:50.981
I hope you don't mind that I asked you.

12:51.082 --> 12:52.883
I mean, you don't have to
answer if you don't want to.

12:52.984 --> 12:54.685
It might be inappropriate. I don't...

13:00.291 --> 13:03.227
If you have feelings for him

13:03.328 --> 13:06.930
and he's a good person, then...

13:07.031 --> 13:10.801
The first time you have
sex should be lovely.

13:10.902 --> 13:14.705
- It should?
- Mm-hmm. It should.

13:14.806 --> 13:17.107
- Okay.
- You're old enough

13:17.208 --> 13:19.576
that I don't have to lecture
you about birth control and STDs

13:19.677 --> 13:21.245
- and...
- Oh, my God, no, you don't.

13:28.853 --> 13:30.921
Thank you.

13:32.791 --> 13:35.659
I'll be back in a few hours.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.295
I'm gonna stop the bypass from happening.

13:49.107 --> 13:50.874
No, wait in the car.

14:12.831 --> 14:15.833
Where the hell have you been?

14:59.744 --> 15:03.514
Don't you walk out on me
when I'm talking to you!

15:03.615 --> 15:05.215
Get back here now!

15:05.316 --> 15:10.153
I told
you to wait in the car.

15:19.297 --> 15:23.033
You okay?

15:23.134 --> 15:25.969
Yeah, fine.

15:26.070 --> 15:29.239
My dad's a dick. Whatever.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.575
- I got the money.
- How much is that?

15:31.676 --> 15:34.811
$600. Should be enough.

15:38.049 --> 15:39.783
Actually, screw the lumber.

15:39.884 --> 15:42.019
Maybe we should take this
dough and get out of here...

15:42.120 --> 15:45.656
put this whole stupid
place in our rearview.

15:45.757 --> 15:48.225
I'm not sure how well that
would work for me, but...

15:48.326 --> 15:50.627
Why? Because you're scared?

15:50.728 --> 15:54.131
No, because my mom would probably put out

15:54.232 --> 15:56.533
an amber alert before
we even hit Eagle Creek.

16:04.142 --> 16:07.778
We can do tech later. I
want to show you something.

16:07.879 --> 16:10.581
Don't worry. It's around here.

16:10.682 --> 16:13.183
Okay.

16:41.312 --> 16:42.813
May I help you?

16:42.914 --> 16:45.749
Yes, hello. I'm here to see Nick Ford.

16:54.025 --> 16:55.970
Over here, Norma Bates.

17:02.099 --> 17:04.968
I see you found the place.

17:05.069 --> 17:07.436
Is that your boat?

17:07.538 --> 17:09.539
Yes, it is.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.944
Come on aboard. Just
come up around the back.

17:30.661 --> 17:32.896
Thank you so much for seeing me.

17:32.997 --> 17:36.132
Your boat... uh, "boat"...
your yacht is beautiful.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.001
"Boat" is fine.

17:38.102 --> 17:39.536
Would you like something to drink?

17:39.637 --> 17:41.137
No. I'm okay. Thank you.

17:41.238 --> 17:42.872
- Let's have a little something.
- Okay.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.240
Andrea, a bottle

17:44.342 --> 17:46.242
of the Chevalier-Montrachet in the fridge.

17:46.344 --> 17:47.595
Of course, Mr. Ford.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.316
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

17:59.423 --> 18:02.158
So let's talk bypass, shall we?

18:02.459 --> 18:04.061
Okay.

18:05.629 --> 18:08.565
I'm still in awe of you, by the way...

18:08.666 --> 18:12.168
Going off on Lee Berman, that arrogant ass.

18:12.269 --> 18:14.704
Well, I'm sure you could
tell him whatever you wanted,

18:14.805 --> 18:16.206
and he'd actually listen.

18:16.307 --> 18:20.076
You would think so, yes.

18:20.177 --> 18:23.179
Yes, you would, but it
doesn't work that way.

18:23.280 --> 18:27.250
- Why doesn't it?
- It just doesn't.

18:27.351 --> 18:30.153
But you, Norma Bates,

18:30.254 --> 18:34.424
you have nothing to lose
by going against him.

18:34.525 --> 18:38.194
You have no position, no power.

18:38.295 --> 18:39.729
You're an innocent...

18:39.830 --> 18:42.565
a young...

18:42.666 --> 18:44.300
Single mother,

18:44.401 --> 18:46.769
a businesswoman fighting to save her motel.

18:46.870 --> 18:48.771
It's... it's quite touching. Hmm.

18:48.872 --> 18:50.506
Yes.

18:50.608 --> 18:52.609
I can't oppose him openly.

18:52.710 --> 18:56.346
I'm too mixed up in everything
that goes on in this town.

18:56.447 --> 18:58.982
- But you can.
- I can?

18:59.083 --> 19:02.518
You can oppose him for both of us.

19:02.620 --> 19:06.189
Well, if you ask me, the
problem is Lee Berman.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.191
Before he got on the city council,

19:08.292 --> 19:10.460
the bypass was totally stalled.

19:10.561 --> 19:12.662
Yeah, that's true.

19:12.763 --> 19:15.999
But don't worry about Lee Berman.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.201
I'm gonna help you maneuver this,

19:18.302 --> 19:22.071
and I'll pull some
strings when I'm able to.

19:22.172 --> 19:23.573
How does that sound? That sounds great.

19:23.674 --> 19:27.076
Good. This could be fun.

19:32.116 --> 19:35.018
To doing what's right.

19:39.323 --> 19:41.591
Mmm.

19:41.692 --> 19:43.126
You like it?

19:43.227 --> 19:46.162
Yes, it's... it's very good.

19:46.263 --> 19:50.400
- It's very good.
- Okay.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.502
The first thing I want you to do...

19:52.603 --> 19:54.203
Mm-hmm.

19:54.305 --> 19:58.374
- Go see this guy.
- Okay.

19:58.475 --> 20:01.377
This will be our first
shot across their bow.

20:01.478 --> 20:02.779
- So who... who...
- Excuse me.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.514
Mr. Ford, it's time
for the conference call.

20:04.615 --> 20:05.682
They're holding.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.417
I really have to take this call.

20:07.518 --> 20:11.354
Just go see him. I'll be in touch.

20:11.455 --> 20:12.488
Oh, okay.

20:12.589 --> 20:14.490
Sorry.

20:14.591 --> 20:16.659
But thank you so much for doing this.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.128
I can't begin to tell
you how grateful I am.

20:20.898 --> 20:22.799
You're a charming woman, Norma.

20:22.900 --> 20:26.536
It's gonna be a real
pleasure working with you.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.282
Hi.

20:56.652 --> 20:58.319
Sorry. I didn't realize this door opened

20:58.420 --> 20:59.854
right into your office.

20:59.955 --> 21:02.590
- I'm looking for Brian Fuller.
- Oh, that's me.

21:02.691 --> 21:04.959
I'm Norma Bates. Nick
Ford gave me your card?

21:05.060 --> 21:08.062
Oh, great. Yeah, I have
your report right here.

21:09.665 --> 21:12.200
- Okay.
- Yeah, just finished it.

21:12.301 --> 21:14.636
You just finished it? Finished what?

21:14.737 --> 21:16.204
The report. It's all set.

21:16.305 --> 21:17.472
You can file it as is.

21:17.573 --> 21:19.974
File it?

21:20.075 --> 21:23.211
Nick didn't explain all
the details to you, did he?

21:23.312 --> 21:25.580
- No.
- Okay, so I'm a biologist,

21:25.681 --> 21:27.382
and I prepared this.

21:27.483 --> 21:28.983
It's an environmental impact report

21:29.084 --> 21:32.520
with a request for an immediate injunction.

21:32.621 --> 21:35.223
"Pistol river pocket gopher"?

21:35.324 --> 21:38.226
Yeah, they're on the
endangered-species list,

21:38.327 --> 21:40.161
and they just happen to live on the land

21:40.262 --> 21:43.264
where they want to build the bypass.

21:43.365 --> 21:45.500
I see.

21:45.601 --> 21:48.169
Oh, okay, so...

21:48.270 --> 21:50.438
So just file that down at City Hall,

21:50.539 --> 21:53.441
and it should bring everything
to a grinding halt...

21:53.542 --> 21:56.477
For a while, anyways.

21:56.578 --> 21:58.179
Do I owe you anything for this?

21:58.280 --> 22:01.382
No, it's all taken care of.

22:01.483 --> 22:02.884
Okay, then.

22:04.787 --> 22:06.821
This is so great.

22:06.922 --> 22:09.891
This is great.
Thank you very much.

22:19.902 --> 22:21.836
Hey, boys.

22:21.937 --> 22:25.573
What's going on?

22:25.674 --> 22:26.974
We're just packaging up the 50 keys

22:27.076 --> 22:29.310
that we're shipping down to Palo Alto.

22:29.411 --> 22:31.546
Cool. Hey, you want to
grab some lunch later?

22:31.647 --> 22:33.281
Sure.

22:33.382 --> 22:34.749
Yeah, I thought we'd
go to that Mexican place

22:34.850 --> 22:36.451
that Remo's always talking about...

22:36.552 --> 22:38.820
You know, talk shop.

22:38.921 --> 22:41.489
Yeah, yeah. What time do you
want us to meet you there?

22:41.590 --> 22:44.158
"Us"?

22:44.259 --> 22:45.460
Yeah, me and Remo.

22:45.561 --> 22:48.296
Oh, no.

22:48.397 --> 22:49.931
No, Remo can't go.

22:50.032 --> 22:52.467
Those duffels of cash got
to make it up to checco's.

22:52.568 --> 22:54.602
He's making a delivery for me.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.810
You got a problem?

23:02.911 --> 23:05.179
No, no, I just kind of...

23:05.280 --> 23:08.583
just a bit psyched for some Mexican.

23:10.452 --> 23:12.487
Well, maybe Dylan will
bring you some leftovers.

23:18.293 --> 23:20.795
You said you, uh, come out here at night?

23:20.896 --> 23:23.931
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't it kind of scary?

23:24.032 --> 23:25.633
Well, I mean, you know,

23:25.734 --> 23:26.968
a girl out here by herself.

23:27.069 --> 23:28.703
What, I'm gonna have an altercation

23:28.804 --> 23:30.705
with a ground squirrel?

23:30.806 --> 23:35.343
No, you're just, uh, so alone out here.

23:35.444 --> 23:37.612
You don't avoid things just
because you're scared of them.

23:57.366 --> 24:00.268
You heard my dad yelling?

24:00.369 --> 24:03.771
Uh-huh.

24:03.872 --> 24:06.174
I'm sorry.

24:06.275 --> 24:09.243
It's okay. I'm almost 18.

24:09.344 --> 24:11.345
I can leave soon.

24:11.446 --> 24:14.430
You're lucky you have such a
good relationship with your mom.

24:21.723 --> 24:23.658
Hey.

24:31.667 --> 24:34.202
You remember when I said I
could be a really nice guy, Zane?

24:34.303 --> 24:35.736
You remember that? Till I break you?

24:35.838 --> 24:37.305
Get up.

24:53.989 --> 24:55.723
That's the warm-up, Zane.

24:55.824 --> 24:58.259
When you least expect
it, I'm gonna show up,

24:58.360 --> 25:01.195
and I'm gonna bury you and your
little business in the ground.

25:01.296 --> 25:04.765
And now you know I'm a man
of my word, right, Zane?

25:20.450 --> 25:23.318
Just between you and me, I've
been thinking of hitchhiking

25:23.419 --> 25:25.420
down the pacific coast of Mexico.

25:25.521 --> 25:26.888
Wouldn't that be cool?

25:28.791 --> 25:30.992
I've never met a girl like you.

25:31.093 --> 25:33.828
Like what?

25:33.929 --> 25:36.464
Uh, you're just so, um...

25:36.565 --> 25:38.833
I don't know.

25:38.934 --> 25:42.036
I guess I feel safe with you.

25:42.138 --> 25:44.773
That's a weird thing for
a guy to say, isn't it?

25:47.510 --> 25:50.345
No, it's nice, actually.

25:55.751 --> 25:57.752
Can I tell you something...

25:57.853 --> 25:59.687
Something I've never told anyone?

25:59.789 --> 26:01.523
Sure.

26:03.526 --> 26:05.260
When you found me in the coffee shop,

26:05.361 --> 26:08.863
that... that wasn't the first time.

26:08.964 --> 26:11.132
The blackout?

26:11.233 --> 26:14.869
How many times has that happened?

26:14.970 --> 26:17.839
I don't know... mm, a couple?

26:19.375 --> 26:21.109
You know, it's like I get upset

26:21.210 --> 26:24.546
or stressed or something,
and then I don't remember.

26:26.782 --> 26:28.917
At least you can get lost in your own head.

26:29.018 --> 26:31.553
I've got to come all the
way out here to do it.

26:39.495 --> 26:41.496
Come on, I want to show you something.

26:44.366 --> 26:47.402
Yo, wait up!

26:54.777 --> 26:56.778
Cody?

27:00.449 --> 27:01.883
- Right here, dude!
- Aah!

27:01.984 --> 27:03.651
You're just plain mean.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.821
You didn't know that? Check it out.

27:15.898 --> 27:17.899
Now we go up.

27:35.017 --> 27:37.018
Just follow me.

28:00.276 --> 28:02.777
You can use that board as a step.

28:05.114 --> 28:08.349
Aah!

28:08.450 --> 28:10.718
You're all right. You're fine.

28:10.819 --> 28:13.154
Just hang on.

28:13.255 --> 28:14.656
Pull yourself up.

28:14.757 --> 28:16.190
Grab up higher on the rope.

28:32.074 --> 28:35.877
Oh, boy, that was, uh...

28:38.914 --> 28:40.882
The rope is sketchy, but...

28:40.983 --> 28:44.118
Then again, I don't want
anybody else ever coming up here.

29:51.636 --> 29:53.103
Excuse me.

29:53.204 --> 29:54.971
I'm Norma Bates of the Bates Motel.

29:55.072 --> 29:56.506
I'd like to deliver this

29:56.607 --> 29:59.476
to all the members of the city council...

29:59.577 --> 30:03.079
Especially Mr. Lee Berman.

30:03.180 --> 30:06.716
Tell him Norma Bates said hello.

30:26.504 --> 30:28.705
It was really hard to find this address.

30:28.773 --> 30:31.041
I'm glad you did.

30:31.108 --> 30:33.810
Wow. You look beautiful.

30:36.805 --> 30:39.940
I was checking out the real-estate
last time I was up here.

30:40.008 --> 30:42.676
- You're moving here?
- I'd like to...

30:42.744 --> 30:44.145
Someday.

30:44.246 --> 30:45.746
I need a ton of money first, though.

30:45.814 --> 30:47.081
Well, if you want to make money,

30:47.182 --> 30:48.549
you're in the right business.

30:48.650 --> 30:52.119
Yeah. It'll take a while, though.

30:52.187 --> 30:53.921
I'd like to get my own
little piece of property

30:54.022 --> 30:57.558
up in the hills, you
know, grow my own crop.

30:57.659 --> 31:00.194
You mean weed, right? We're
talking weed, not corn.

31:00.295 --> 31:02.029
Yes, weed.

31:02.097 --> 31:05.900
So you want your own little
weed farm to call your own?

31:06.001 --> 31:08.736
- Something like that.
- That's nice.

31:08.837 --> 31:13.007
You can have that dream...
your own little weed farm.

31:13.108 --> 31:15.643
This is America.

31:19.581 --> 31:24.018
- Are you gonna kiss me now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

32:04.859 --> 32:06.547
What the hell happened to you?

32:08.597 --> 32:10.444
I had to kick the sh... out of somebody.

32:12.901 --> 32:14.868
- W-where are my clothes?
- Your clothes?

32:14.970 --> 32:16.437
You mean the ones you left
in a heap all over your room?

32:16.538 --> 32:18.005
Yeah, yeah, those clothes.

32:18.073 --> 32:19.673
They're upstairs. I washed them.

32:19.774 --> 32:21.508
You're sticking your hand in an ice bucket?

32:21.610 --> 32:22.843
- Have you cleaned that cut?
- Okay, I don't remember

32:22.944 --> 32:24.645
asking you to take care of my laundry.

32:24.713 --> 32:28.382
Sorry. Next time I'll
leave them on the floor.

32:28.450 --> 32:30.384
Well, isn't that what
happens at most motels?

32:30.452 --> 32:31.785
The motel owner doesn't come into your room

32:31.886 --> 32:33.153
and pick up your clothes

32:33.255 --> 32:34.822
- and do your laundry for you.
- I know you.

32:34.889 --> 32:36.957
- How does that matter?
- Of course it matters.

32:37.058 --> 32:38.158
Come upstairs. It's gonna get infected.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.127
No, I'm not... it's fine.

32:40.228 --> 32:42.630
It's not fine. It's dirty,
and you need to clean it up.

32:46.868 --> 32:50.471
So why exactly did you
need to beat up someone?

32:50.538 --> 32:52.706
Let's just say I had my reasons.

32:54.743 --> 32:56.977
Don't you ever get tired of being so stoic?

32:57.078 --> 32:59.013
Seriously, you never want
to talk about anything.

32:59.114 --> 33:01.181
It's a little boring.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.983
So is being dead.

33:03.084 --> 33:05.619
You learn not to shoot your
mouth off in this business.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.921
Okay, tough guy, whatever.

33:11.559 --> 33:13.594
I get it.

33:13.662 --> 33:17.197
Sometimes it just feels
good to whale on someone.

33:17.299 --> 33:19.199
I whacked the shit out
of the real-estate agent

33:19.301 --> 33:20.801
who sold me this house

33:20.902 --> 33:23.437
when I found out that
I-I couldn't unload it.

33:23.538 --> 33:26.807
I did it with my purse. It felt great.

33:26.908 --> 33:28.609
- Oh, my God.
- What?

33:28.710 --> 33:31.078
You smiled. I thought
your face was paralyzed.

33:31.179 --> 33:33.480
Uh-huh. I'm pretty sure I didn't smile.

33:33.581 --> 33:35.916
- God, you're contrary.
- Oh, and you're not?

33:46.828 --> 33:48.595
Well, I'm working on it.

33:48.663 --> 33:51.865
You know, I'm making friends,
trying to be more social.

33:51.966 --> 33:53.434
I met this guy recently.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.669
I wonder if you know
who he is... Nick Ford.

33:57.505 --> 33:59.206
Where'd you meet him?

33:59.273 --> 34:00.974
At a party at Christine
and Peter helden's house.

34:01.075 --> 34:02.309
Why? What's wrong?

34:02.410 --> 34:04.044
Nick Ford's in the drug business.

34:04.145 --> 34:06.046
You're not involved with
him somehow, are you?

34:06.147 --> 34:07.447
No.

34:07.548 --> 34:10.250
No, I'm not involved in anything at all.

34:10.351 --> 34:13.253
I'm just wondering if you know who he is.

34:13.353 --> 34:16.255
You want my advice? Stay
away from him at all costs.

34:16.357 --> 34:18.358
Okay.

34:21.996 --> 34:22.996
There's your laundry.

34:23.097 --> 34:27.100
- Yeah, don't ever do it again.
- You're welcome.

34:53.696 --> 34:57.233
Hello there. It's Norman,
and I will call you back.

35:20.391 --> 35:23.426
- What the hell happened to you?
- Romero.

35:23.494 --> 35:26.462
- He did that to you?
- Hey...

35:26.563 --> 35:29.032
I hired a guy to torch the dude's house.

35:29.133 --> 35:31.000
So what do you expect?

35:31.101 --> 35:34.203
But it was worth every minute of it.

35:34.304 --> 35:36.439
I see
you started without me.

35:36.507 --> 35:37.440
Hey!

35:37.508 --> 35:39.442
Can I get a damn beer?

35:39.510 --> 35:41.310
So we roll back to his place, right?

35:41.412 --> 35:43.479
Me, him, and three German girls.

35:43.580 --> 35:45.348
I mean, he's got this
insane house overlooking

35:45.416 --> 35:47.817
all of Hollywood with a vodka tasting room.

35:47.885 --> 35:50.186
- You know what that is?
- No.

35:50.254 --> 35:53.389
Hmm. It's an all-glass freezer room

35:53.490 --> 35:55.024
that he keeps at 28 degrees,

35:55.125 --> 35:56.826
and it's just stocked
with bottles of every...

35:56.894 --> 35:58.127
Premium vodka around the world.

35:58.228 --> 35:59.896
And we go inside...

36:54.505 --> 36:55.481
Norman.

36:58.343 --> 37:00.494
Norman, I need to talk to you.

37:02.413 --> 37:04.147
I don't know where you've been,

37:04.182 --> 37:06.917
and I'm not gonna give
you the third degree.

37:06.951 --> 37:09.086
I'm not gonna be that mother.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.556
I raised you to make good choices,

37:12.590 --> 37:14.491
and I'm gonna assume that you will,

37:14.525 --> 37:16.363
but I will tell you one thing.

37:18.529 --> 37:20.030
Okay.

37:20.064 --> 37:22.199
That girl is not a good choice.

37:22.233 --> 37:24.968
She's rude. She's disrespectful to adults.

37:25.003 --> 37:29.339
I mean, not to be prejudiced,
but she smokes and has tattoos,

37:29.374 --> 37:31.475
which I could live with if she was decent,

37:31.509 --> 37:33.710
but she's not.

37:33.745 --> 37:36.747
She's really not like that, mother.

37:36.781 --> 37:39.850
She's a nice girl.

37:39.884 --> 37:44.487
I think she just gets
uncomfortable around parents.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.663
Norman, women can be tricky.

37:56.333 --> 37:59.368
And you have such a good heart.

37:59.403 --> 38:02.505
There's girls like her,
girls that have no future.

38:02.539 --> 38:05.174
They're just raised like a weed.

38:05.209 --> 38:07.677
They're just trapped in
some unbearable circumstance

38:07.711 --> 38:10.213
that they can't get out of.

38:13.484 --> 38:17.553
I'm... I'm just saying,
that's the kind of girl

38:17.588 --> 38:19.922
that can get you into trouble, hmm?

38:19.957 --> 38:21.524
You know, talk you into
things, get pregnant.

38:21.558 --> 38:24.894
Next thing you know, your life is over.

38:24.928 --> 38:28.030
I-I didn't make the world the way it is.

38:28.065 --> 38:31.634
There are people who can help
you and people who can hurt you,

38:31.668 --> 38:33.436
and you gotta pick the right people.

38:33.470 --> 38:36.172
That girl Cody is not the right people.

38:36.206 --> 38:38.508
I really don't want you
seeing her anymore, Norman.

38:38.542 --> 38:41.077
I have to see her at tech.
The play's in a few weeks.

38:45.783 --> 38:48.084
Then we'll be done.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.519
Okay, fine.

38:49.553 --> 38:50.953
Finish the play. You made a commitment.

38:50.988 --> 38:52.889
But I don't want you spending time with her

38:52.923 --> 38:55.491
outside of there, okay?

38:55.526 --> 38:57.627
Okay, mother.

38:57.661 --> 38:59.662
Okay.

39:17.548 --> 39:20.016
Is that gonna be okay?

39:20.050 --> 39:22.084
We're not going underwater, are we?

39:22.119 --> 39:24.253
Not that I can think of.

39:44.241 --> 39:47.243
Second thought... maybe keep it close.

40:40.134 --> 40:41.601
What's the matter?

40:44.505 --> 40:47.373
- You didn't hear the news?
- No, what news?

40:49.576 --> 40:52.111
Lee Berman, from the city council,

40:52.146 --> 40:53.613
was in a car accident tonight.

40:53.647 --> 40:56.616
His car crashed off Summit Vista road

40:56.650 --> 40:59.126
and then went all the
way down into the Ravine.

41:00.754 --> 41:02.355
He's dead.

41:37.124 --> 41:38.638
You're awake.

41:42.896 --> 41:45.095
I heard you just saved my brother's life.

41:53.574 --> 41:55.685
We're gonna take care of all this...

41:56.777 --> 41:58.962
Expenses...

41:59.646 --> 42:01.714
Get you back on your feet.

42:01.748 --> 42:03.783
I don't want you worrying
about any of it, okay?

42:06.820 --> 42:10.189
I just wanted to meet
the famous Dylan massett.

42:12.693 --> 42:13.961
Who are you?

42:16.096 --> 42:17.583
I'm your boss.
