04:31.479 --> 04:33.773
You need a bath, Borras.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.999
- [ Manita, manita. ]
- [ Yes? ]

06:15.500 --> 06:19.587
- [ It's almost 1pm. ]
- [ I'm coming. ]

06:40.650 --> 06:44.237
- Manita, my keys...
- [ There they are. ]

06:56.249 --> 06:58.626
- [ I'm leaving. ]
- [ Take care. ]

07:03.256 --> 07:05.425
Borras, stay.

07:36.497 --> 07:40.501
- Don't let him out.
- Hi, Borras.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.217
[ Manita, manita!
Fermín is on the phone. ]

07:48.342 --> 07:51.262
What are you saying?

07:53.473 --> 07:58.603
- [ Go away. ]
- [ Ok, but I want to know. ]

07:58.728 --> 08:02.899
- What are you saying?
- Go upstairs.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.319
Stop talking like that.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.197
Go.

08:23.169 --> 08:27.215
- [ What did Fermín say? ]
- [ Just hello. ]

08:27.340 --> 08:30.468
[ Yeah right. ]
You're dating!

08:30.593 --> 08:35.431
[ Of course not. ]
He's just a friend.

08:35.556 --> 08:42.855
- Besides, you introduced us.
- I'm just messing with you.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.691
They're home.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.778
Borras.

08:50.613 --> 08:55.952
Borras, stay.
Come in.

09:10.675 --> 09:15.137
So that kid was throwing water balloons
at cars that were driving by.

09:15.263 --> 09:21.143
Then an army jeep drove by,
the kid throws a balloon at it,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.854
the solider gets mad,
he gets out, and shoots him.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.189
Oh God! Is he ok?

09:25.481 --> 09:27.858
He shot him in the head.
He's dead.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.402
How awful.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.071
Adela?

09:32.905 --> 09:38.327
Mrs. Sofia is here
and the kids want strawberries.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.538
Hurry.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.375
Thank you.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.003
- I got an A plus.
- That's great!

09:47.086 --> 09:49.755
And Sofi did, too, I imagine.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.926
Cleo, my husband's two suits
need to be taken to the cleaners.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.679
But do it today, please.
He needs to pack, he's leaving Friday.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.514
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.976
- Dad's going away?
- To a conference in Quebec.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.146
- Where is that?
- In Canada!

10:05.313 --> 10:10.359
- You're so stupid!
- I didn't know, so what?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.903
Not for Sofi, she'll get fat.

10:13.029 --> 10:21.787
...when I tell you that I'm poor,
you won't ever, smile again...

10:22.079 --> 10:29.962
...I long to have it all,
and lay it at your feet...

10:30.296 --> 10:39.263
...But I was born poor,
and you'll never love me.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.603
- You shouldn't be up here.
- I'm taking care of him.

10:45.770 --> 10:51.484
Your mom won't like it.
Don't go near the edge.

11:11.295 --> 11:15.132
- You were supposed to die.
- Why me?

11:15.257 --> 11:18.219
- 'Cause it's my game.
- Then I don't want to play anymore.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.138
Well, I don't want you to play it,
you little sissy.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.714
And what's up with you?
Aren't you gonna tell me?

11:54.922 --> 12:00.219
- Can't talk. I'm dead.
- Then resurrect.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.932
- I can't. I'm dead.
- Alright then.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.862
What are you doing?

12:20.114 --> 12:24.535
What are you doing?
Tell me.

12:24.660 --> 12:28.372
I can't. I'm dead.

12:34.503 --> 12:40.468
Hey. I like being dead.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.396
Here, Borras.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.913
Dad's home early!

14:26.866 --> 14:30.327
- Who's here?
- Daddy.

15:36.852 --> 15:40.731
- Hello.
- Who are these kids?

15:40.856 --> 15:45.235
- I'm glad you're home early.
- What a surprise!

15:49.990 --> 15:52.618
-Money for the hurdy gurdy?
-I don't see any.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.495
No, money to get one.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.164
- So tell me Your Excellence.
- Your Excellence.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.041
Thank you, sir.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.419
-Have you heard the latest news?
-What about?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.129
Hawaii, Doctor.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.383
I'm very well, thank you.

16:42.751 --> 16:47.673
-Cleo, can you get the Doctor a tea?
- No! She's with me!

16:47.756 --> 16:52.344
- She'll be right back.
-Just a few more minutes.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.913
[ Scoot. ]

17:20.039 --> 17:22.458
[ Hey! ]

17:22.958 --> 17:27.546
Make Dr. Antonio a chamomile.
[ Move. ]

17:37.347 --> 17:40.934
Angel of God, my guardian dear...

17:41.060 --> 17:44.396
...to whom God's love commits me here.
Ever this day, be at my side...

17:44.521 --> 17:48.108
...to light and guard,
and rule and guide.

17:52.613 --> 17:57.868
[ Little one, sleepy little one. ]

17:57.993 --> 18:03.791
[ Sleep with the angels. ]

18:14.676 --> 18:17.763
Time to sleep, my darling.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.433
- Good night, Cleo.
- Good night, Sofi.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.352
I love you.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.564
I love you too.
Sweet dreams.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.858
You too.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.739
Toño, go to sleep!

18:35.864 --> 18:39.952
...and if your mom asks
when you'll be back?

18:40.077 --> 18:44.206
I'll call her.
Where's my brown tie?

18:44.331 --> 18:48.418
- I'll ask Cleo.
- This house is a mess.

18:48.544 --> 18:55.134
The fridge is full of empty cartons
and there's dog crap everywhere.

20:39.655 --> 20:45.244
- [ Why so long, manita? ]
- [ Pepe turned on the lights again. ]

20:45.744 --> 20:47.829
[ He's a prankster. ]

20:47.955 --> 20:51.124
- Yes. My boy.
- Little devil.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.379
Yes. But I love him.
Turn off the light.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.091
[ Mrs. Teresa doesn't
like it on. ]

20:59.216 --> 21:05.264
[ Oh that Mrs. Teresa.
She is probably spying on us. ]

21:05.681 --> 21:11.103
Yeah, she's there stalking you.

21:11.228 --> 21:15.774
- Hurry up.
- She probably stays awake.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.903
Taking care of us.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.657
Taking care we don't
waste electricity.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.660
- Ready?
- Yes.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.621
One.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.791
Two.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.128
Three.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.425
[ Mrs. Adela. ]

21:43.218 --> 21:44.928
One.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.433
- For the tamales.
- They were yummy.

21:49.558 --> 21:53.395
Two.
For the tortas.

22:20.464 --> 22:24.009
- [ I won. ]
- [ We drew. ]

22:24.134 --> 22:27.137
- [ No, I won. ]
- [ But the car! ]

22:27.262 --> 22:30.015
[ Let's eat. ]

22:35.103 --> 22:38.440
No movement yet.

22:38.565 --> 22:44.529
Professor Zovek is used
to challenges.

22:44.780 --> 22:50.577
[ Do you remember 'pushy' Moises,
from home? ]

22:50.702 --> 22:55.707
- [ He kept sending me letters. ]
- [ What did they say? ]

22:55.832 --> 22:58.460
[ That he can't stop
thinking about me. ]

22:58.585 --> 23:01.421
[ That he needs to see me. ]

23:01.546 --> 23:06.843
[ Then my cousin arrives carrying
a bunch of letters. ]

23:06.968 --> 23:11.098
[ And I recognized Moises'
handwriting on one. ]

23:11.223 --> 23:15.102
[ So I grabbed it and opened it. ]

23:15.227 --> 23:21.775
[ "I can't stop thinking about you.
I want to see you." ]

23:21.900 --> 23:25.278
- [ Sweet thing. ]
- [ Yeah right, 'sweet'. ]

23:25.404 --> 23:29.658
- [ That letter was for another girl! ]
- No!

23:29.783 --> 23:35.080
The bastard sends exactly the
same letter to all the girls.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.670
Why so lonely with your tacos?

23:41.795 --> 23:44.548
Hello, Ramón!
Hello, Fermín!

23:44.673 --> 23:47.175
- You guys want a bite?
- Thanks, we ate.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.763
If you're done, let's go.
I like watching the previews.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.473
Let's go.

24:22.377 --> 24:27.466
- You really feel like seeing a movie?
- I like movies. Don't you?

24:27.591 --> 24:30.886
But it's so nice outside.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.389
Yes, it's nice.
Want to go to the park?

24:34.514 --> 24:37.642
Sure.
Give me a sec.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.982
What, you not coming?

24:44.107 --> 24:47.694
- It's really nice outside.
- Look at you.

24:47.819 --> 24:52.073
I'd rather play in the dark.
Tell me everything later.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.079
Shall we?

26:02.310 --> 26:06.439
- What?
- You train every day?

26:06.565 --> 26:12.028
I must.
I owe my life to martial arts.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.199
I grew up with nothing.

26:17.784 --> 26:26.918
My mother died when I was a kid.
I moved with my aunt to the slums.

26:27.711 --> 26:32.340
There my cousins beat me.
And I met the wrong crowd.

26:32.465 --> 26:37.554
And I started drinking, and then huffing.
I was dying.

26:39.848 --> 26:44.060
But then I discovered martial arts.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.271
And everything came into...

26:48.648 --> 26:49.899
...focus.

26:53.862 --> 26:58.450
Just like when you look at me.

28:34.295 --> 28:38.758
[ Kitty, kitty,
sleepy kitty cat. ]

28:38.925 --> 28:43.596
[ Wake up as here
comes the mouse. ]

28:54.357 --> 28:58.820
- Good morning, my princess.
- Morning, Cleo.

28:58.945 --> 29:01.322
Time to wake up.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.743
I need to pee.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.916
- Good morning, Sofi.
- Good morning, Grandma.

29:20.842 --> 29:24.846
Paco.
Wake up, my angel.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.599
Come on.

29:30.101 --> 29:32.771
It's time.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.529
- I want one!
- They're mine.

30:22.654 --> 30:26.366
- I got them for everyone.
- But I put them in the freezer.

30:26.491 --> 30:31.037
Give Sofi one and I'll
get you a box.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.462
Hurry up kids, it's 7:20.

30:39.587 --> 30:43.174
Nah-huh, it's 7:17.

30:43.299 --> 30:46.135
Here. Get fatter.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.263
- Turn that off!
- No!

30:48.388 --> 30:50.473
- Turn it off!
- Ok, I'll turn it off.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.101
- Cleo, hold the dog.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.436
- Get out my way!
- You get out of my way!

30:55.562 --> 30:56.980
Shotgun!

31:01.943 --> 31:06.656
- Put on Radio Exitos!
- I'm up front. I choose.

31:08.825 --> 31:12.328
- Be careful.
- Move over.

31:12.453 --> 31:16.457
- Change the station!
- No, it's Creedence vs. Beatles.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.336
- Move!
- Calm down, for God's sake!

31:20.461 --> 31:24.257
You choose when
it's your turn.

31:24.382 --> 31:28.052
- Settle down.
- Shut up.

31:28.177 --> 31:31.890
- I'm not going to shut up.
- You too, quiet!

31:55.079 --> 32:00.543
When I was old, you were there,
but you were someone else.

32:00.668 --> 32:04.213
- When you were old?
- Yes.

32:04.339 --> 32:09.344
- Or when you get old?
- No, when I was old.

32:09.469 --> 32:15.350
- And when was that?
- Before I was born.

32:15.475 --> 32:20.521
- And what did you do then?
- I was a pilot.

32:20.647 --> 32:24.233
- A pilot?
- Yes, a fighter pilot.

32:24.359 --> 32:28.112
- Did you like it?
- No, it was scary.

32:28.237 --> 32:32.909
Was it?
I'll be right back.

32:36.955 --> 32:40.750
- [ Good evening. ]
- [ Why didn't you wake me? ]

32:40.875 --> 32:47.048
God forbid you'll get tired.
Prepare Dr. Antonio's oatmeal.

32:47.674 --> 32:53.054
- Mom!
- Good morning!

33:00.353 --> 33:02.355
Your juice.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.984
Pepe will wait to say
goodbye to Daddy.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.611
- It's fine if he's late.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:08.736 --> 33:11.864
- I'll take the bags, Doctor.
- Thanks.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.034
- Hi, Daddy!
- Your oatmeal is ready, Doctor.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.704
Pepe waited to say goodbye.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.288
Morning, Pepón!

33:19.414 --> 33:21.624
Yuck! Cigarette!

33:45.314 --> 33:49.902
- Damn...
- Mom, Daddy stepped on dog poo.

33:50.028 --> 33:54.073
- Let me help you, Cleo.
- Thank you, Doctor.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.583
- Bye, Pepón!
- Bye, Daddy.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.377
- Take care.
- You too.

34:06.502 --> 34:09.839
- Go with Cleo.
- Yes, Mom.

34:22.726 --> 34:28.232
- We'll be here, Antonio.
- It's just a few weeks.

35:31.712 --> 35:37.260
Goddamnit! I've told you
to clean up the dog shit!

35:37.385 --> 35:40.555
I'll take him. Come on.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.850
- Bye, Cleo!
- Bye.

37:03.763 --> 37:07.433
Hey, I have to...

37:22.156 --> 37:26.327
It's just that, I'm late.

37:39.382 --> 37:44.053
I think I'm pregnant.

37:46.806 --> 37:52.228
Ah, well.
That's good, right?

37:52.353 --> 37:55.147
Yes?

37:57.316 --> 38:00.861
Yeah.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.971
- I need the bathroom.
- But it's almost over.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.432
Yes, but I have to go now.
I won't be long.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.767
- Want an ice cream?
- No.

40:39.478 --> 40:44.233
No strings!
No tricks!

40:50.906 --> 40:55.327
Boom!
Bones is dead!

41:04.086 --> 41:10.885
It's raining, it's pouring!
The old man is snoring...

41:47.630 --> 41:52.468
[ Manita. You take it. ]

41:53.177 --> 41:56.388
[ Don't be afraid. ]

42:04.813 --> 42:10.653
- And when they ask about their dad?
- Say he's on a business trip.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.908
Thank you, Cleo.

42:16.492 --> 42:21.830
Mrs. Sofi? When you have
a minute can we talk?

42:21.956 --> 42:27.211
Sure,
but just call the kids first.

42:27.336 --> 42:29.046
Ok.

42:30.464 --> 42:35.594
- Stay calm.
- Paco, Toño, your mom is calling you!

42:35.678 --> 42:41.684
- You have to be strong for the children.
- Okay, Mom.

42:44.103 --> 42:47.940
Sofi, Pepe, your mother
is calling you.

42:54.572 --> 43:00.869
Come, sweetie.
We'll come back after.

43:15.301 --> 43:20.097
- I got more hail than Sofi!
- I got more than Pepe!

43:20.222 --> 43:24.518
- No, I got more.
- You both have the same.

43:24.643 --> 43:28.814
- I'm going to the stationers.
- You can go later. Sit down, Cleo.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.524
I have news.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.235
- We're going to Disneyland!
- Yeah, Disneyland!

43:33.402 --> 43:36.822
No. We're spending Christmas
at your uncle's.

43:36.989 --> 43:41.952
- It's so boring there!
- No it isn't, my cousins are there!

43:42.119 --> 43:45.039
And New Year's,
we'll go to the Bárcenas' Hacienda.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.207
Are the Richards going?

43:47.374 --> 43:51.420
- And the Larssons.
- When's Dad coming?

43:51.503 --> 43:57.176
His research is keeping
him in Quebec a little longer.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.845
- Until January?
- He doesn't know.

43:59.928 --> 44:04.683
But I brought paper so you
can write him a letter.

44:04.808 --> 44:09.271
Tell him that you love him and
to please come home soon...

44:09.396 --> 44:10.856
I'm going to the store.

44:10.939 --> 44:13.692
You're not going anywhere
until you're done with your letter.

44:13.817 --> 44:17.321
- Where are you going?
- Can't I write it in my room?

44:17.446 --> 44:18.572
No!

44:19.657 --> 44:24.536
- Sure. Go to your room.
- Then I'm going up too.

44:31.418 --> 44:33.504
Sofi, I need to talk with Cleo.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.465
Help Pepe write his letter at the table.

44:36.590 --> 44:40.469
Help him write,
"I miss you a lot, Dad".

44:40.594 --> 44:44.848
- Make lots of pretty drawings.
- Let's go, Pepe.

44:48.852 --> 44:51.021
Wait, Sofi!

44:53.232 --> 44:55.818
Come, Cleo.

44:59.822 --> 45:02.032
What's up?

45:03.409 --> 45:07.705
What is it?
Are you alright?

45:07.830 --> 45:12.876
- Yes.
- Sure? What's wrong?

45:13.293 --> 45:17.798
- Is your mom alright?
- Yes.

45:17.923 --> 45:22.636
- Oh, Mrs. Sofi...
- What's wrong?

45:22.761 --> 45:27.933
It's just that I think
I'm pregnant.

45:29.309 --> 45:33.939
- What do you mean you "think"?
- I haven't gotten my period.

45:35.274 --> 45:40.946
- Since when?
- I don't know...

45:41.113 --> 45:46.910
- Who's the father?
- Fermín. The cousin of Adela's boyfriend.

45:47.035 --> 45:52.791
- Does he know?
- He's gone.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.836
Silly.

45:55.961 --> 46:02.217
- Are you going to fire me?
- Fire you? Of course not!

46:02.301 --> 46:07.598
We have to take
you to get checked.

46:07.723 --> 46:12.519
- Look, Mom! I drew a plane.
- Let's see.

46:12.853 --> 46:16.148
Why is Cleo crying?

46:16.273 --> 46:19.943
She has a tummy ache.

46:20.068 --> 46:26.241
Pain, pain, go away.
I don't want this pay to stay.

46:26.366 --> 46:29.745
Sofi! I told you to help Pepe
write "I miss you a lot, Dad".

46:29.912 --> 46:31.497
He wouldn't let me help!

47:14.039 --> 47:15.916
Sorry.

48:10.971 --> 48:15.058
We have an appointment
with Doctor Vélez.

48:15.183 --> 48:19.771
- Under what name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.315
Here she comes.

48:21.440 --> 48:25.235
- Sofía!
- Margarita! How are you?

48:25.360 --> 48:27.696
Thank you for seeing us.
Remember Cleo?

48:27.821 --> 48:30.824
- Hi, Cleo, how are you?
- Fine, thank you, Doctor.

48:30.949 --> 48:34.995
I'm going to check her
and we'll see you later.

48:35.120 --> 48:38.165
Ok. I'll go to say
hi to Dr. Zavala.

48:38.290 --> 48:41.460
It'll take about 40 minutes.

48:41.585 --> 48:44.546
Cleo, come with me.

48:44.963 --> 48:51.720
When was your last period?
About when?

48:51.845 --> 48:54.598
Three months.

48:54.723 --> 48:59.811
Are you sexually active?

49:00.979 --> 49:03.607
You are.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.654
When did you start?

49:10.572 --> 49:13.700
Has it been long?

49:15.661 --> 49:19.831
- Not long.
- One or two years?

49:21.708 --> 49:27.798
- Less.
- But more than three months?

49:27.923 --> 49:32.552
How many sexual partners
have you had?

49:33.845 --> 49:38.684
Just one?

49:38.809 --> 49:41.353
Don't worry. This is common.

49:41.478 --> 49:46.400
We'll examine you from the waist down...

49:46.525 --> 49:51.154
...she'll get you in position.

49:51.279 --> 49:54.408
Lie down, carefully.

50:00.497 --> 50:03.792
Put one leg here.

50:03.917 --> 50:06.878
And the other here.

50:11.508 --> 50:15.887
I'll see you in a month.
Any questions?

50:16.596 --> 50:21.226
There she is.
I'll go with you.

50:21.351 --> 50:25.397
He hasn't even
called the kids.

50:25.522 --> 50:28.775
- Mario!
- Doctor.

50:31.069 --> 50:34.448
- How's Cleo?
- Cleo is fine.

50:34.573 --> 50:38.076
She's three to four months
pregnant.

50:38.201 --> 50:41.663
With some rest she'll be fine.

50:41.788 --> 50:47.044
- When's she due?
- Around the end of June.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.172
- Thanks for seeing her.
- It's nothing!

50:50.297 --> 50:52.883
- Take care.
- You too.

50:53.008 --> 50:54.634
- Mario.
- Doctor.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.678
- Take care.
- Thanks.

50:56.803 --> 50:59.890
Cleo, why don't you go to see the
newborns...

51:00.015 --> 51:03.852
...while I finish up with Dr. Zavala?

51:03.977 --> 51:06.188
You have to talk to Antonio.

51:08.482 --> 51:14.905
- Look at your little sister, Azucena.
- I'm glad she's a girl.

51:15.072 --> 51:20.619
Yes. So you can play with her.

51:20.786 --> 51:26.583
I'll do her hair, and bathe her...

51:27.334 --> 51:34.132
Soon we'll take her home so
you can play with her.

51:35.592 --> 51:39.596
Earthquake!
Kneel.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.641
Get the babies out!

51:42.766 --> 51:45.685
- Don't run!
- Use the stairs!

51:45.811 --> 51:48.563
"Our Father, Who art in Heaven..."

51:50.440 --> 51:53.443
Hurry, the babies!

52:57.883 --> 52:59.885
Are they gonna be talking in English
the whole time?

52:59.968 --> 53:03.263
Yes. And Ricky isn't even Gringo,
he was born in Mexico.

53:03.388 --> 53:06.641
- Yes, but his mom is Gringa.
- Leslie scares me.

53:06.725 --> 53:08.727
She makes me feel like I stink.

53:08.810 --> 53:10.395
Because you do stink, fatty.

53:10.478 --> 53:13.064
You smell even more, idiot.

53:14.024 --> 53:15.525
Stinky.

53:16.651 --> 53:18.236
Shut up, idiot.

53:33.168 --> 53:37.172
- Comadre, welcome!
- Hi, "commy".

53:37.714 --> 53:42.427
- That belly of yours?
- I'll tell you later.

53:42.552 --> 53:48.391
- Yes, you will.
- Sure, but give me a hand.

53:49.684 --> 53:52.437
You sure you
can carry it all?

53:52.562 --> 53:56.316
I'm pregnant, not sick.
Why, you tired?

53:56.441 --> 54:00.654
- As if!
- You've got so old since last year.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.949
Mountains are old,
but they're still green.

54:04.074 --> 54:08.453
Here! You're pregnant
and forgetful?

54:09.496 --> 54:13.333
- That's one bed.
- This goes here.

54:13.458 --> 54:16.878
And there's the other.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.923
This one's for Paco.

54:22.926 --> 54:25.345
They were in storage.

54:25.470 --> 54:28.682
They're all the dogs
that lived here.

54:28.807 --> 54:32.269
Look. That there
was Pirata...

54:32.394 --> 54:36.022
...he died in 1911.

54:37.065 --> 54:40.610
- Do you remember Canela?
- Yes, where is she?

54:40.735 --> 54:44.364
Look at her.
She died last summer.

54:44.489 --> 54:47.409
They say she ate a poisoned rat.

54:47.534 --> 54:53.498
But I'm sure it was the villagers
angry with Don José over the land.

54:54.165 --> 54:57.043
Come on.

56:00.648 --> 56:02.984
What do you think
of these city folks, Celso?

56:03.109 --> 56:07.447
- Should we send for more bullets?
- There's plenty, Doctor José.

56:07.572 --> 56:11.701
Paco! Don't go there!
Cleo, get him.

56:11.826 --> 56:15.205
Paco, I'm telling you.
Stay there!

56:15.372 --> 56:17.832
What? Women don't shoot?

56:17.957 --> 56:21.169
No, no, no. Not that.
Leslie is our representative.

56:21.294 --> 56:25.882
- Doesn't count, she's a Gringa.
- Ok, I'll go.

56:40.939 --> 56:45.026
You look great, Lola.

56:52.784 --> 56:57.789
Watch out Pepe! Your wife is
going to join the guerrilla!

56:57.914 --> 57:03.753
- She's going to expropriate your hacienda!
- Nah, I'll whack her first.

58:45.813 --> 58:48.483
- Come with me.
- Where?

58:48.608 --> 58:51.402
- Just come.
- What about him?

58:51.528 --> 58:54.656
Is the boogeyman coming?

58:58.368 --> 59:02.247
Where are we going?

59:02.372 --> 59:06.251
Don't ask.
The city's made you distrustful.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.461
No, Benita.

59:08.586 --> 59:12.757
- Look at the dogs.
- They're tired.

59:12.882 --> 59:16.427
The kids won't leave
them alone.

59:20.598 --> 59:25.436
Be careful, don't roll down
with that belly of yours.

59:25.562 --> 59:28.398
No, Benita.

59:40.034 --> 59:44.330
- There's a lot of music.
- It's New Years!

59:44.455 --> 59:46.541
Should I call Lupe and Yola?

59:46.624 --> 59:50.086
No, no, no.
We don't want those city nannies here.

59:50.211 --> 59:52.880
They feel fancier than their bosses.
Come on.

59:57.635 --> 01:00:01.180
- They allowed you out?
- Move aside.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.516
Sit here.

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:08.021
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing, thank you.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:11.899
You're not going to toast the
New Year with us?

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:16.195
- It's not good for the baby.
- A little won't hurt.

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:21.034
Celebrate while you can!
See that man over there?

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:25.913
They killed his son in
August over the land dispute.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:29.667
- You're carrying life, right?
- Yes.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:34.213
- So then? Mezcal?
- No, just a little pulque.

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:37.008
That's the spirit!

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.305
Here.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:48.770
To a beautiful 1971 and
your baby's health!

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:54.567
- Sorry, Manita...
- Go dance, Gloria!

01:00:54.692 --> 01:01:00.073
Don't worry.
I'll pour you some more.

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:04.077
Here.
Clean yourself up.

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:06.746
Salud!

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:37.860
- What's wrong with you?
- I know you need it.

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:42.782
- Billy, no!
- I just wanted to comfort you.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:49.205
- You're drunk.
- You're not even that hot, comadre.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.488
Fire!

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.115
Fire!... Fire!...

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.785
The forest is burning!

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:14.540
Everybody! Quick!
Fire in the woods!...

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:20.087
Come on! Move!
This way, everyone!

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.433
Careful!
Cover that side!

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.274
- Come here. Now!
- We need water!

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:44.237
Make a chain!

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:51.035
We need water!
Pass the buckets!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.955
Kids! Stay back!

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:59.377
Kids! Don't step on the flames!

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:07.969
Cleo, help the little ones
get water.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.723
Just the little fires.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:18.604
That's it, Andy!
Gerardo, Cleo will help you.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:28.447
Not too close to the fire!

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:29.860
I got one!
It ran away!

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:37.159
Got it!

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:56.429
- We'll reach the hill skirt and come back!
- Skirt?

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:59.890
- The hillside.
- The hill has a skirt?

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:04.270
- The slope then!
- Alex! The hill has a skirt!

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:08.649
If we look under we
can see its panties.

01:07:08.774 --> 01:07:11.861
- What are you doing?
- Peeking at the hill's panties.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:14.655
Hills don't have panties.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.950
- Neither do you!
- Asshole!

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:21.162
I'm going to tell your parents!

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.597
This feels like my village.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.893
It's drier there.
But it feels like it...

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:49.899
The animals do that too.

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:56.906
It sounds like this.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:04.371
And smells the same.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:35.569
They repaired the Galaxy.
It looks like new!

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.160
The Cowboys won because
Baltimore got cocky.

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:47.665
- We won anyway!
- Baltimore got cocky...

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:51.836
- Who likes the Cowboys?
- And Cruz Azul champions forever!

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.754
- Hello, Beto.
- Afternoon, Señora.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:56.048
- Can we go to the movies?
- To see what?

01:08:56.173 --> 01:08:58.259
- Marooned.
- I wanna see it too.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.761
- Only Beto and me.
- Why?

01:09:01.886 --> 01:09:04.055
- I wanna go too!
- No!

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.517
- Everyone can go!
- Not fair!

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.812
- I'm going.
- You're not.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:12.481
- Everyone goes!
- That's not fair!

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:15.024
If you don't like it,
go live elsewhere!

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.069
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.238
- I'll get it upstairs.
- I'll take them.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.740
No! You won't like it.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.326
- I like movies.
- Not this one.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.495
Eat poo!

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.457
- Is it a cartoon?
- No, it's not.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:35.712
- You don't know what Marooned is.
- Yes, I do!

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:57.234
We're late!
Are you coming?

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:01.572
- Grandma, we need to go.
- Toño, let's go. We're leaving!

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:05.576
Wait! I'm coming.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:25.763
- Catch him!
- Hurry up!

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:29.433
Come on, we're late!

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.025
What are you waiting for?

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.531
Don't run!

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:03.467
- Toño!
- Run!

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:06.470
- Cleo, get them!
- I'll see you at the movies!

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.973
Control your children!

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:34.975
- Check her out!
- Look at her!

01:12:36.435 --> 01:12:38.228
Antonio.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:41.398
Hey, watch out!

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:44.276
- Look, your dad!
- Run, Antonio, run!

01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:47.321
- No, it wasn't my dad.
- Yes, it was your dad.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.948
I said no!

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.871
Put the magazine away!

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:03.087
Your grandma is worried.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.927
Come on, let's get the tickets.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:23.375
...following our illustrious governor
instructions...

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:29.798
...to improve the infrastructure,
I've come here today...

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:40.851
...to respond to your
demand for water.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:49.026
This can only happen by
uniting the will of the people...

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:57.409
...with the leadership of our illustrious
President Luis Echeverría Álvarez.

01:14:57.534 --> 01:15:01.205
Excuse me, do you know
where this address is?

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.916
- That way.
- Thank you.

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:08.712
We will move... above and beyond!

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.658
Ramón!

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.205
Ramón!

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:29.668
Hold up.
Wait.

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:32.087
- What's up, Cleo?
- Hi.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:34.965
I just came to give
Fermín his jacket.

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.885
- I'll give it to him.
- But, I need to talk to him.

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:42.431
- He's not here.
- It's important.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:45.475
But we're rehearsing.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.354
Adela said you
would help.

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:52.441
One sec.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.194
Hold on to this.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:59.197
Can you give me a ride?

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.407
Let's go.

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:03.493
Hold on, let me
put on some pants.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:24.723
Here is where he trains.

01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:27.059
Thank you, Ramón.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:33.774
- Don't tell him I brought you.
- No. Thank you.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:06.408
Right flank!

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.470
- It's Zovek.
- No! Really?

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.930
Yes! Look at him.

01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:32.309
- The Professor Zovek?
- Yes!

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.103
Does he always come here?

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:38.315
No. But sometimes
he trains them.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:20:00.378
Welcome!
May the energy dwell in you.

01:20:02.422 --> 01:20:03.715
You.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.050
You...

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:07.093
...and you as well!

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:09.262
You can become a warrior!

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:12.349
Every human has a great potential...

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.435
...that can be developed
through physical training.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:23.068
Yes! But most importantly through
the evolution of the mind...

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.612
...and the spirit.

01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:30.617
You can develop this potential.
But don't expect a miracle!

01:20:30.742 --> 01:20:37.123
The only miracle resides
within your own will.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:46.216
Remember, the mind
is the motor for the physical.

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:50.762
And next up next...

01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.184
an act.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:05.527
This act requires total
physical and mental focus.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:15.495
Only the Lamas, martial arts masters
and a few great athletes...

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.374
...have been able to master it.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.712
You.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.339
Yes, you. Come here.

01:21:29.342 --> 01:21:32.554
Please cover my eyes.

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:38.393
Make sure they are properly covered.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.816
Thank you. You may return to
your place.

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:27.901
What? Disappointed?

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:32.739
What did you expect?
For me to levitate or lift a jet?

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:35.533
You are witnessing an
incredible feat!

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:39.829
If you don't believe me?
Then try it.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:43.249
But with your eyes closed.

01:23:42.892 --> 01:23:44.644
Hey, Lobo!

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:46.688
Hey, Fermín.

01:23:46.813 --> 01:23:50.525
What about the new trainers?

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:56.364
- The Korean coach is good.
- Yes, but tough.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.457
Fermín.

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:09.502
Do you have a minute?

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.049
Piss off!

01:24:16.384 --> 01:24:19.220
- Hi, Cleo.
- Hi, Fermín.

01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:21.723
What brings you around?

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:26.936
I've left you messages,
but I couldn't find you.

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:30.607
I'm sorry, training has been intense.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.777
They even brought a gringo coach
and a Korean.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.155
Well, the American was already here,
but the Korean is new.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:41.576
- Is it for the Olympics?
- Something like that.

01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:44.704
Who told you I was here?

01:24:44.829 --> 01:24:52.003
A neighbor's brother-in-law
trains here with you.

01:24:52.128 --> 01:24:54.964
- It was Ramón.
- No.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:25:01.930
I'm gonna kick that
fat fucker's ass.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:08.186
- It's just that I'm pregnant.
- What's it to me?

01:25:08.311 --> 01:25:12.023
- It's that... The little one's yours.
- No fucking way.

01:25:12.148 --> 01:25:16.027
- I swear it is.
- I told you, no fucking way.

01:25:16.152 --> 01:25:19.989
And if you don't want me to beat
the shit out of you and your "little one"...

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:24.077
...don't ever say it again,
and don't ever come looking for me again.

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:30.542
Fucking servant!

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:36.339
Hurry up, Fermín!

01:25:58.027 --> 01:26:02.991
He went with his mistress
to Acapulco.

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:08.163
He hasn't sent a dime,
and it's been six months.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:12.458
He says he's short on money
and doesn't have any to send.

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:17.130
But now he likes diving,
and is buying all the gear.

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:21.968
You know how much that costs?

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:28.683
He sent the kids a letter
pretending he's in Quebec.

01:26:28.808 --> 01:26:35.899
Just bullshit he invents:
That the landscape is beautiful...

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:42.238
That he misses them
but his research is delayed.

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:45.658
Lies!

01:26:47.493 --> 01:26:51.539
- Ok, don't worry, I'll call you later.
- Paco, come here.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:56.044
Are you spying on me?

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:59.631
I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry!

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:06.012
And you! Why did
you let him? Why?

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:12.101
Why are you still there?
Don't you have anything to do?

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:14.896
Get out!

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:19.400
Please, don't tell your siblings.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:29.035
You're winning by two laps!

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.248
He's passing you, Paco!

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:36.417
But I'm still winning.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:41.714
- I want to play!
- No. Move!

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:45.426
- Move, Pepe.
- No.

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:48.012
- Move!
- No.

01:27:48.137 --> 01:27:50.598
I said move!

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.977
- That's mine, Paco!
- No, it's mine.

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:35.893
Cleo!

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:39.355
- They're fighting.
- I'm coming.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:48.906
Paco, Toño, stop!
You're going to get hurt!

01:28:49.032 --> 01:28:51.576
You're not animals!

01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:55.621
Let him go!

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.334
Paco, drop that!

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:02.128
What are you doing!
Drop that!

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:07.008
Don't be an idiot!

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:11.721
Are you stupid?
You could've killed him!

01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:15.308
It's very dangerous.

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.900
[ Hey manita. ]

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:27.904
[ I heard the government
came to the village... ]

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:31.741
[ ...to seize land, and they've
taken your mom's. ]

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:36.954
- [ How can I help her? ]
- [ You could go see her. ]

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:42.919
- [ Like this? ]
- [ Don't worry. ]

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:51.636
[ Go rest, I'll open the gate. ]

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:17.346
We are alone.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:23.644
No matter what they tell you,
we women are always alone.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:13.819
We'll have to park here.
The students are protesting.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:17.573
Oh, God. I hope they don't
beat them again.

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:19.492
Look. Someone's leaving.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:39.345
Go ahead.

01:33:42.992 --> 01:33:45.202
Good afternoon, Señora.

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:50.082
My maid needs a crib.
Can you show them to us?

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:55.087
- She'll show them to you.
- Thank you.

01:33:55.212 --> 01:33:58.341
This way, please.

01:34:06.265 --> 01:34:08.184
How about this one?

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:12.438
- Do you like it, Cleo?
- It's very pretty.

01:34:12.563 --> 01:34:14.774
How much is it?

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:18.861
No, but with a
long-standing client discount.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.781
Let me ask the manager.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:25.451
We bought the furniture for
the boy's room here.

01:34:25.534 --> 01:34:27.703
Which is now in
Sofi and Pepe's room.

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:29.664
- The blue set?
- Yes.

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:06.283
Please help me!
They're killing us!

01:35:13.165 --> 01:35:15.418
Where is he?

01:35:17.586 --> 01:35:20.214
Get in!
Leave him alone!

01:35:20.339 --> 01:35:22.174
Move!

01:35:22.299 --> 01:35:24.969
- Shut up!
- Come here!

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.889
I said shut up!

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.018
Fermín!
Let's go!

01:35:38.649 --> 01:35:41.318
Let's go! Now!

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:44.947
Help me!

01:35:49.618 --> 01:35:52.788
Help!

01:35:54.582 --> 01:36:00.421
Be calm, Cleo.
Ignacio!

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:27.323
Help me!

01:36:28.824 --> 01:36:31.911
Jorge, please, let's go!

01:36:34.246 --> 01:36:36.916
Why?

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.126
Help!

01:36:39.251 --> 01:36:42.588
Help me!

01:37:14.745 --> 01:37:20.376
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee...

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:23.731
Dr. Vélez!

01:38:24.106 --> 01:38:26.859
- Dr. Vélez!
- Get in line!

01:38:26.984 --> 01:38:29.778
- You have an appointment?
- Her water broke.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:34.742
- Find Dr. Vélez.
- Here she comes.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:37.661
Doctor, your patient is here.

01:38:37.786 --> 01:38:41.081
Orderly, please.
Sofía just called me.

01:38:41.206 --> 01:38:45.169
Hello, ma'am.
Cleo, you're having contractions.

01:38:45.294 --> 01:38:50.007
Let's get her to delivery.
You'll have to fill out some forms.

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:52.968
Paty, take their information.
We're going to delivery.

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:56.722
Yes, doctor.
Please, come this way.

01:38:56.847 --> 01:39:01.060
- What's her full name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:04.355
- Her middle name?
- I don't know.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.441
- How old is she?
- I don't know.

01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:10.486
Her date of birth?

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:14.114
- What's your relationship with the patient?
- I'm her employer.

01:39:14.239 --> 01:39:17.284
Is there any family
member here?

01:39:17.409 --> 01:39:20.079
- No. No.
- That's fine.

01:39:20.245 --> 01:39:23.332
One last question.
Is your patient insured?

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:33.133
Good evening.

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:38.138
Careful.
Let's go.

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:43.435
One moment, please.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.104
Excuse me.

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:46.855
Doctor.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:51.193
Hello, Cleo. How are you feeling?
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:54.196
Isn't it, Dr. Vélez?
How many babies have you delivered?

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:57.241
Hundreds, doctor.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:40:02.788
Give me your hand.
And breathe.

01:40:02.913 --> 01:40:06.542
- We must hurry.
- Yes, doctor.

01:40:10.879 --> 01:40:13.757
Excuse me.
Over here.

01:40:14.717 --> 01:40:16.385
This way.

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:20.180
Dr. Vélez won't let me go in.
You'll do great, Cleo.

01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:23.267
Feel free to come if you like.

01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:27.438
- I can't. I have an appointment.
- Come on, let's go.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:33.569
I'm taking a patient to delivery.
Ask admissions for her file.

01:40:36.155 --> 01:40:38.157
Please assist me.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:41.994
Pass me the partogram.
Let's examine her.

01:40:42.411 --> 01:40:44.288
Yes, doctor.

01:40:44.413 --> 01:40:48.417
She's in labor.
Her water broke.

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:51.837
Cleo, when was your last period?

01:40:51.962 --> 01:40:54.006
September.

01:40:54.131 --> 01:40:57.843
I'm removing your underwear
and shoes.

01:40:57.968 --> 01:41:00.262
We're moving you into position.

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:05.392
- I'm going to listen to your baby.
- When did your water break?

01:41:05.517 --> 01:41:10.522
- Around two hours ago?
- We couldn't get here quicker.

01:41:10.647 --> 01:41:15.027
- Don't worry. Breathe.
- I'm uncovering your belly.

01:41:15.194 --> 01:41:18.781
Easy, Cleo.
Breathe deep.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:23.410
- How is the heart rate?
- I can't hear anything, doctor.

01:41:23.535 --> 01:41:26.288
- A glove, please.
- Glove, doctor.

01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:29.958
I need you to breathe deeply.

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:34.213
I'm going to inspect you.
It'll bother a bit.

01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:37.674
- Relax. Easy, please.
- It's going to hurt a little.

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.762
- How is it?
- Complete. Direct. Third plane.

01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:46.225
- Meconium liquid, doctor.
- We need to canalize.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:50.354
- Moving patient to surgery.
- Let me listen to your baby.

01:41:50.479 --> 01:41:52.856
Easy.

01:41:52.981 --> 01:41:55.692
- I'm not hearing anything, doctor.
- Let's move.

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:58.487
Get the stretcher.

01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:01.865
Cleo, breathe deeply.
We're taking you to surgery.

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:04.660
Ok. One, two, three.

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:07.538
- Let's go!
- Easy.

01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:13.669
Patient coming through.
Call pediatrics!

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:49.913
- Call pediatrics.
- No scrubs. It's an emergency.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.374
Turning on lamp.

01:42:55.419 --> 01:42:59.506
Everyone ready?
One, two, three.

01:43:00.382 --> 01:43:03.552
Pediatrics to surgery!

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:08.849
Move your waist
further down, please.

01:43:10.976 --> 01:43:15.314
Doctor, she's crowning.
No time for your scrubs.

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:19.526
- Pediatrician to the room!
- He's in the room, doctor.

01:43:19.651 --> 01:43:24.489
- Doctor, she's crowning.
- I'm checking.

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:28.535
Where is the pediatrician?

01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.038
I'm here, doctor.

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:36.919
Patient ready to deliver.
The head is out.

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:42.007
Edwin, please.
Cut the cord.

01:43:42.132 --> 01:43:45.844
- Tongs.
- Cut the cord, please.

01:43:45.969 --> 01:43:48.263
Cutting.

01:43:48.847 --> 01:43:53.769
- We couldn't hear a heart rate, doctor.
- Bulb.

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:55.729
Your stethoscope.

01:43:55.854 --> 01:43:58.941
We're going to give you
a few stitches.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:02.653
- I can't hear a heartbeat.
- Listening.

01:44:02.778 --> 01:44:06.698
It's in arrest. Begin resuscitation.

01:44:06.823 --> 01:44:09.159
Your placenta is coming out.

01:44:09.284 --> 01:44:12.537
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

01:44:12.788 --> 01:44:14.122
Listening.

01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:17.459
Your placenta is coming out.

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:21.672
Ma'am, I can't hear
a heartbeat.

01:44:21.797 --> 01:44:23.507
Placenta coming out.

01:44:23.632 --> 01:44:28.136
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:33.058
Listening.
No response.

01:44:33.183 --> 01:44:36.061
- Another cycle, doctor?
- Let's continue.

01:44:36.186 --> 01:44:40.607
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

01:44:40.732 --> 01:44:44.278
- Here it is, doctor.
- Listening.

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:50.033
No response.
We're suspending CPR.

01:44:57.082 --> 01:45:02.629
- Doctor, what's the patient's name?
- Cleo, doctor.

01:45:02.754 --> 01:45:05.424
Cutting...

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:12.389
Cleo, I'm very sorry.
Your baby was born dead.

01:45:12.514 --> 01:45:16.977
We did all we could, but
there was no response.

01:45:17.102 --> 01:45:19.146
Would you like to hold it?

01:45:23.942 --> 01:45:29.364
Here is your baby.
It's a girl.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:39.166
Say goodbye to her.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:46.465
I need to take her now, Cleo.
Say goodbye to her.

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:56.558
Let me have her, please.
I need to prepare her.

01:46:02.397 --> 01:46:05.901
Allow me...

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:09.613
- Prepare her, please.
- Yes, doctor.

01:46:09.738 --> 01:46:11.740
...Gutiérrez, Cleodegaria.

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:15.077
Here's the file, doctor.

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:28.799
There's a bit of bleeding.
We gave you a few stitches.

01:46:28.965 --> 01:46:33.345
We're very sorry, Cleo.

01:48:21.077 --> 01:48:26.833
Cleo! The knife sharpener!
[ Shake yourself off. ]

01:50:02.053 --> 01:50:06.224
- Toño! Sofi! Come!
- Mom bought a new car!

01:50:06.349 --> 01:50:09.728
- You like it?
- How fast does it go?

01:50:09.853 --> 01:50:11.521
Why not a Maverick?

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:14.858
Too expensive.
I wanted a smaller car.

01:50:14.983 --> 01:50:18.820
- I've had it with that Galaxy.
- I like it, Mommy.

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:23.074
- What about the Galaxy?
- I sold it.

01:50:23.199 --> 01:50:25.285
- It goes next week.
- Does Dad know?

01:50:25.452 --> 01:50:28.371
No, it's a surprise.

01:50:28.496 --> 01:50:31.583
- Do you like the new car, Cleo?
- Yes.

01:50:31.708 --> 01:50:33.126
And speaking of surprises.

01:50:33.251 --> 01:50:36.630
We're taking the Galaxy
for a goodbye trip.

01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:38.256
- Where to?
- Tuxpan.

01:50:38.381 --> 01:50:39.424
Where's that?

01:50:39.549 --> 01:50:41.301
- I've got a match.
- Skip it.

01:50:41.426 --> 01:50:42.844
Tuxpan is near Veracruz.

01:50:42.969 --> 01:50:44.387
- Is there a beach?
- Yes.

01:50:44.512 --> 01:50:46.514
The beaches in Veracruz are ugly.

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:49.017
And we're going to invite
Cleo along, right?

01:50:49.184 --> 01:50:50.477
Yes!

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:52.395
Will you come?

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:54.356
Come on. It'll do you good.

01:50:54.439 --> 01:50:56.066
-Right, Adela?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:50:56.191 --> 01:50:59.194
Besides, the kids will miss you
if you don't come.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:02.614
But she'll be on vacation,
you can't make her work.

01:51:02.739 --> 01:51:07.494
- Will you come?
- [ Go Manita. I'll take care of the house. ]

01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:10.997
So, you're coming?

01:51:11.122 --> 01:51:13.291
Perfect!
Would you help me pack?

01:51:13.416 --> 01:51:15.377
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go pack.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:18.088
[ Go. It'll lift your spirits. ]

01:51:18.213 --> 01:51:23.176
- I'm gonna help her pack.
- Pepe, bring the guns.

01:51:53.289 --> 01:51:56.418
Stop changing it.

01:51:58.211 --> 01:52:02.507
- La Pantera doesn't reach this far.
- I just heard it.

01:52:02.632 --> 01:52:04.551
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:52:04.676 --> 01:52:07.262
No, it's not! It's only in the city.

01:52:08.847 --> 01:52:10.223
Look! The sea!

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.850
Mom, stop, stop!

01:52:11.975 --> 01:52:16.688
- Let's go to the hotel first.
- No. It'll be dark by then.

01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:19.399
Beach! Beach!

01:52:25.029 --> 01:52:27.323
Alright.
But just for a little bit!

01:52:27.490 --> 01:52:28.783
Yeah!

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:46.259
Let's go.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:07.906
- Come.
- No, I don't know how to swim.

01:53:08.031 --> 01:53:09.824
Come on.

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:13.661
You go.
I'll watch you from here.

01:53:31.513 --> 01:53:36.226
- Which way?
- Follow me.

01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:39.521
- Can we go back again?
- Yes, of course.

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:43.274
- But now a hot bath.
- Yes.

01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:47.445
I want to go back.

01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:49.280
It was amazing!

01:53:49.405 --> 01:53:52.158
I jumped over a huge wave!

01:54:04.045 --> 01:54:08.049
Ow! Mom. Ow! Don't!

01:54:14.305 --> 01:54:19.394
- Ow! It burns!
- I'm almost done.

01:54:20.436 --> 01:54:24.023
Did you like the waves?

01:54:24.148 --> 01:54:27.318
I did.

01:54:27.443 --> 01:54:32.240
Do you know how to dive
under them?

01:54:33.491 --> 01:54:36.369
Have you gone mute?

01:54:36.494 --> 01:54:38.621
No. Let's go.

01:54:38.955 --> 01:54:42.208
- I told you to put on a t-shirt!
- But it was cloudy!

01:54:42.333 --> 01:54:45.461
The glare burns the most.

01:54:47.755 --> 01:54:50.091
Dressed already?

01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:53.177
Yes, but Cleo's gone mute.

01:54:53.303 --> 01:54:55.597
- Thank you, Cleo.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:59.183
You two smell like salad.

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:25.418
Children...!

01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:29.005
Kids! Listen!

01:55:29.505 --> 01:55:31.382
I have something to tell you.

01:55:34.135 --> 01:55:36.554
Your dad isn't in Ottawa.

01:55:36.679 --> 01:55:42.060
- Is he back?
- No. Your dad never went away.

01:55:42.518 --> 01:55:46.648
Well he did, but only for a week.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:51.319
Your dad isn't coming back home.

01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:55.657
We came here so he
can take his things.

01:55:55.782 --> 01:56:01.454
- What things?
- What he says are his things.

01:56:01.579 --> 01:56:05.208
His clothes... his books...
the bookcases...

01:56:05.959 --> 01:56:08.962
Are you getting a divorce?

01:56:10.338 --> 01:56:14.092
- He doesn't know.
- He doesn't love us anymore?

01:56:14.217 --> 01:56:17.804
Of course he loves you,
a lot.

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:21.975
- He says he wants to see you.
- When?

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:27.522
He doesn't know.
But soon.

01:56:27.897 --> 01:56:31.943
There's going to be changes.
But we'll be together!

01:56:32.068 --> 01:56:34.445
And it's going to be an adventure!

01:56:34.570 --> 01:56:37.573
I'm starting a full-time job
at a publishing house.

01:56:37.699 --> 01:56:40.535
But you're a biochemist.

01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:43.871
I know, but your dad
hasn't sent us any money.

01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:46.499
And teaching isn't enough.

01:56:46.624 --> 01:56:51.045
And I love books!
And I never really liked biochemistry.

01:56:51.170 --> 01:56:54.090
It'll be another adventure.

01:56:54.215 --> 01:56:57.802
And we must stay together,
really close.

01:56:57.927 --> 01:57:00.430
- Right, Cleo?
- Yes.

01:57:00.555 --> 01:57:04.100
Very, very close...

01:57:04.225 --> 01:57:07.228
Darling?

01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:12.483
Are you finished?

01:57:12.608 --> 01:57:15.028
For dessert, we have ice cream...

01:57:15.153 --> 01:57:17.447
...coconut, strawberry...

01:57:17.572 --> 01:57:19.323
...vanilla, banana...

01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:22.201
...and flan.

01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:36.090
Ready for the picture.

01:58:39.862 --> 01:58:43.950
- Are you coming in?
- No, I have to go check the tires.

01:58:44.075 --> 01:58:46.786
We're leaving early tomorrow.
Want to come?

01:58:46.911 --> 01:58:49.497
- No, it's our last day.
- I want to stay too.

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:53.126
Ok, but no swimming.
Cleo can't swim.

01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:56.879
- But it's really calm.
- If you want to stay, that's the rule.

01:58:57.004 --> 01:58:59.966
- Near the shore?
- Ok. But only near the shore.

01:59:00.091 --> 01:59:02.135
- Yes!
- Can I swim too, Mom?

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:04.846
- Yes, but only near the shore.
- Yeah!

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:08.349
Can you watch over them?
I won't be long.

01:59:10.434 --> 01:59:13.354
Stay close to the shore!

01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:28.119
Paco! You heard your mom.
Otherwise, you're getting out.

01:59:32.957 --> 01:59:37.253
Sofi! Paco! Closer to the shore!

01:59:51.893 --> 01:59:57.064
When I was older,
I used to be a sailor.

01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:02.195
But I drowned in a storm.

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:06.949
The waves were huge!

02:00:07.408 --> 02:00:12.997
- Sofi! Paco! Near the shore!
- It was dark...

02:00:13.122 --> 02:00:18.044
...and there was lightning,
and I didn't know how to swim.

02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:22.006
Wait here.

02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:26.177
Paco! Come closer!

02:00:29.764 --> 02:00:31.974
Sofi!

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:38.231
Paco, help your sister!

02:02:43.356 --> 02:02:48.152
What happened?
Are you ok, my love?

02:02:48.277 --> 02:02:52.907
- Cleo saved us.
- Thank you... Thank you.

02:02:53.366 --> 02:02:56.369
Are you ok?

02:02:57.328 --> 02:03:02.333
- I didn't want her.
- What?

02:03:02.458 --> 02:03:07.421
- I didn't want her.
- They're ok.

02:03:09.131 --> 02:03:15.054
I didn't want her to be born.

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:22.728
- We love you so much, Cleo. Right?
- Poor little thing.

02:03:25.606 --> 02:03:30.861
We love you so, so much.

02:04:31.922 --> 02:04:38.679
- I love you, Cleo.
- I love you too, darling.

02:05:31.106 --> 02:05:36.654
Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, come help.
Don't play dumb.

02:05:38.906 --> 02:05:41.992
Hi, Borras.

02:05:45.829 --> 02:05:48.999
- Hi, Adela.
- Hi.

02:05:49.124 --> 02:05:52.878
- Hi, Adela.
- Hello, kids.

02:05:53.003 --> 02:05:55.589
- Hi, Adela.
- Welcome, ma'am.

02:05:55.714 --> 02:05:59.009
- Can I leave this with you?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:06:01.971 --> 02:06:05.057
It looks awful.

02:06:05.182 --> 02:06:08.727
Without the bookshelves,
it's awful.

02:06:08.852 --> 02:06:12.773
- I like it like this.
- It's awful.

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:17.027
- What's awful, Mommy?
- He misses the bookshelves.

02:06:17.152 --> 02:06:20.072
- Which bookshelves?
- The ones that were there.

02:06:20.197 --> 02:06:25.786
- [ I'm going to make dinner. ]
- [ I have so much to tell you. ]

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:31.333
- They've switched the rooms!
- Where's mine?

02:06:31.458 --> 02:06:34.712
- Why change them?
- It's better this way.

02:06:34.837 --> 02:06:37.881
- I liked the old way better.
- Go check yours.

02:06:38.007 --> 02:06:42.553
- How did it go?
- Sofi and Paco almost drowned.

02:06:42.678 --> 02:06:46.223
Hi, Cleo.
Mrs. Sofi's room is there.

02:06:46.348 --> 02:06:49.893
- It's bigger.
- More comfy.

02:06:50.019 --> 02:06:54.273
- Cleo, check out my room!
- In a bit, ok?

02:06:54.398 --> 02:06:58.068
I love it, Mom!

02:06:58.193 --> 02:07:05.159
And we'll have more adventures!
We'll travel a lot.

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:08.537
We'll go to Disneyland!

02:07:08.662 --> 02:07:12.916
We can't afford Disney,
but we can go to Oaxaca.

02:07:13.042 --> 02:07:17.129
- Yes, and visit Cleo's village!
- Great idea!

02:07:17.254 --> 02:07:21.467
Sure, whenever you like.
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

02:07:21.592 --> 02:07:25.346
- Tell me, you almost drowned?
- Yes, the current pulled us.

02:07:25.471 --> 02:07:29.350
- The waves were 15 meters tall.
- No, they were only two meters.

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:33.729
- No, they were taller!
- And Cleo saved us, right, Cleo?

02:07:33.854 --> 02:07:36.398
- Cleo, can I have a smoothie?
- Yes.

02:07:36.523 --> 02:07:38.776
- Me too.
- Are there any Twinkies?

02:07:38.901 --> 02:07:41.987
- Let me check.
- Yes, I got a box.

02:07:55.542 --> 02:07:57.878
[ Wait, ]
where are you going?

02:07:58.003 --> 02:08:01.465
- [ To buy ham. ]
- [ But I have so much to tell you. ]

02:08:01.590 --> 02:08:04.551
- [ Did you have a good time? ]
- [ Yes, it was very nice. ]

02:08:04.635 --> 02:08:07.262
[ I want to hear everything,
I'll be right back. ]

02:08:07.388 --> 02:08:10.683
[ But just get the ham.
No flirting. ]

02:08:45.759 --> 02:08:49.722
For Libo.
