00:04.937 --> 00:08.167
- Hellhounds.
- Yeah, Dean. Your favorite.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.510
- No.
- Aah!

00:12.511 --> 00:14.713
I can't fight. I can't walk.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.248
But I can do something.

00:16.248 --> 00:19.359
I got everything we need
to build a bomb.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.923
- What are we doing?
- Hunting a ghost.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.858
You know who does that? Crazy people.

00:26.859 --> 00:28.593
We are insane.

00:32.765 --> 00:34.566
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.268
This is our last night on earth.

00:36.269 --> 00:40.279
Take this thing to Lucifer
and empty it into his face.

00:44.076 --> 00:45.610
You know I'd never hurt you.

00:45.611 --> 00:47.712
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

00:47.713 --> 00:50.213
I'm gonna kill you myself.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.484
I'm going to rip your heart out.

00:52.485 --> 00:56.454
That's good, Sam.
You keep fanning that fire in your belly.

00:56.455 --> 00:58.089
All that pent-up rage.

00:58.090 --> 01:02.025
I'm gonna need it.

01:16.976 --> 01:20.512
The nurses tell me
that you're not taking your medication.

01:20.513 --> 01:23.013
You want to tell me why?

01:23.549 --> 01:25.984
Susan?

01:25.985 --> 01:29.045
The pills make me sleepy, but I can't-

01:29.989 --> 01:32.489
If I sleep, it'll come.

01:32.825 --> 01:34.792
You mean the monster?

01:34.793 --> 01:36.694
Now, we have talked about this.

01:36.695 --> 01:39.195
But it killed Annie.

01:39.965 --> 01:42.465
Susan, you're schizophrenic.

01:42.701 --> 01:45.431
Your mind plays tricks on you.

01:46.272 --> 01:50.208
You get confused.
Sometimes you see things.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.876
I know what I am.

01:52.878 --> 01:56.047
Like I can see my dead son
standing right behind you.

01:56.048 --> 01:58.548
I know he's not real.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.649
But the monster, it is real.

02:07.059 --> 02:10.562
Annie was your roommate
and what happened to her was painful...

02:10.562 --> 02:13.063
...for all of us.

02:13.399 --> 02:16.901
Perhaps it's easier for you
to conjure up a monster...

02:16.902 --> 02:20.599
...than to face how tragic
her suicide really was.

02:21.674 --> 02:25.303
I can hear it at night, in the walls.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.645
Please.

02:27.646 --> 02:29.814
You have to believe me.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.416
Susan...

02:31.417 --> 02:35.319
...there is no such thing as monsters.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.959
It's 10:30. Lights out.

03:22.935 --> 03:24.469
Oh, my God.

03:24.470 --> 03:27.539
Help me.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.873
- No.
Hey.

03:28.874 --> 03:31.374
They're starting early tonight.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.979
Hurry.

03:40.085 --> 03:41.653
It's coming.

03:41.654 --> 03:48.893
Help me.

04:25.698 --> 04:29.400
You were referred to me
by a Dr. Babar in Chicago?

04:29.401 --> 04:31.569
That's right.

04:31.570 --> 04:35.707
Isn't there a children's book
about an elephant named Babar?

04:35.708 --> 04:39.238
I don't know.
I don't have any elephant books.

04:39.411 --> 04:43.648
Look, doctor, I think that the doc
was in over his head with this one...

04:43.649 --> 04:46.149
...because my brother's, uh:

04:47.419 --> 04:49.220
Okay, fine, thank you, that's-

04:49.221 --> 04:51.222
That's really not necessary.

04:51.223 --> 04:55.125
Why don't you tell me
how you're feeling, Alex.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.430
I'm fine. Heh.

04:59.431 --> 05:02.601
I mean-
Okay, a little depressed, I guess.

05:02.701 --> 05:05.136
All right. Any idea why?

05:05.137 --> 05:08.127
Probably because
I started the apocalypse.

05:09.441 --> 05:12.251
- The apocalypse?
- Yeah. That's right.

05:13.612 --> 05:16.112
And you think you started it?

05:17.416 --> 05:18.616
Well, yeah.

05:18.617 --> 05:24.322
I mean, I killed this demon, Lilith,
and I accidentally freed Lucifer from hell.

05:24.323 --> 05:28.153
So now he's topside,
and we're trying to stop him.

05:29.928 --> 05:31.262
Who is?

05:31.263 --> 05:35.324
Me. Uh, him. And, uh, this one angel.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.068
Oh, you mean like a-?

05:37.069 --> 05:39.937
- Like an angel on your shoulder?
- No, his name's Castiel.

05:39.938 --> 05:42.707
- He wears a trench coat.
See what I mean, doc?

05:42.708 --> 05:46.344
The kid's been beating himself up
about this for months.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.845
The apocalypse wasn't his fault.

05:50.015 --> 05:52.083
- It's not?
- No.

05:52.084 --> 05:55.119
This other demon, Ruby,
got him addicted to demon blood.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.490
I mean, near the end,
he was practically chugging the stuff.

05:59.825 --> 06:02.325
My brother's not evil.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.861
He was just...

06:05.197 --> 06:07.697
...high.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.501
Yeah? So could you fix him up...

06:10.502 --> 06:15.892
...so we can get back to traveling around
the country and hunting monsters?

06:19.144 --> 06:20.978
Erma...

06:20.979 --> 06:23.479
...cancel my lunch.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.653
Dr. Fuller would like to keep you both
under observation for a couple of days.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.021
Both? Me too?

06:30.022 --> 06:33.612
Yes, sugar.
The doctor thinks that would be best.

06:36.261 --> 06:39.030
All right.
I'm just gonna give you a little check-up.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.633
Nurse Ratched, let's get one thing
straight. I've seen Cuckoo's Nest...

06:42.634 --> 06:47.672
...so don't try any of that soul-crushing,
authoritarian crap on me. Hmm?

06:47.673 --> 06:50.173
Okey-dokey.

06:52.344 --> 06:55.179
All right, you can go ahead
and take down your pants.

06:57.082 --> 06:59.582
What? What-? What for?

07:16.301 --> 07:19.202
- How was your Silkwood shower?
- Okay.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.930
Yeah, good. Yeah, good, um-

07:22.107 --> 07:24.108
Good water pressure. Did the nurse...?

07:24.109 --> 07:25.810
She was very thorough.

07:25.811 --> 07:28.871
Yeah. Yeah, good. Good. Yeah. Ahem.

07:35.554 --> 07:37.922
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

07:37.923 --> 07:41.592
Hey, it's the least we could do.
Martin saved Dad more than we can count.

07:41.593 --> 07:45.063
- He's a great hunter.
- Was. Until Albuquerque.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.899
Besides, I just figure
it's best we keep busy.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.400
Better than what?

07:51.236 --> 07:53.736
Nothing.

07:54.339 --> 07:56.839
Okay. Look...

07:57.443 --> 07:59.944
Last few weeks,
you kind of been worrying me.

07:59.945 --> 08:01.078
Come on, Sam. Stop.

08:01.079 --> 08:04.982
Just because we're in the loony bin
doesn't give you the right to shrink me.

08:04.983 --> 08:07.718
- Dean.
- Ellen and Jo dying was a tragedy.

08:07.719 --> 08:10.488
- I'm not gonna wallow in it.
- Dean, you always do this.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.156
You can't just keep this crap in.

08:13.959 --> 08:16.227
Watch me.

08:16.228 --> 08:18.728
Oh, there he is.

08:28.106 --> 08:30.606
Sam, Dean, wow.

08:30.642 --> 08:34.601
Wow, you boys got big. You look good.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.313
Thanks. You do too, Martin.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.984
Uh... Well, thanks for coming.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.655
Yeah.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.125
In the old days
I could've taken care of this...

08:48.126 --> 08:51.056
...with both hands tied behind my back...

08:51.530 --> 08:54.030
...but, well, now...

08:54.132 --> 08:57.068
- What do you think it is we're hunting?
- I don't know yet.

08:57.069 --> 09:01.506
A ghost, demon, monster.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.207
Animal, vegetable, mineral.

09:05.277 --> 09:07.979
Hospital's had five deaths
in the last four months.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.750
Doctors keep calling it suicides,
but they're wrong.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.384
So you've seen this thing?

09:15.587 --> 09:18.087
Has anyone seen this thing?

09:18.156 --> 09:23.666
Well, a couple patients have had glimpses,
but there's not a lot to go on.

09:24.096 --> 09:27.164
- Are they reliable?
- Oh, sure, why wouldn't they be?

09:33.372 --> 09:34.605
Gee, I don't know.

09:34.606 --> 09:37.608
I know you boys think
I'm a bag of loose screws.

09:37.609 --> 09:38.910
You wouldn't be wrong.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.880
But I wouldn't have called you
unless there was something here.

09:42.881 --> 09:45.381
I can feel it in my gut.

09:47.886 --> 09:53.257
We believe you. Have you checked any
of the bodies? Found signs of an attack?

09:53.258 --> 09:57.592
Well, no, I don't-

09:57.763 --> 10:00.698
I don't go around dead bodies anymore.

10:02.467 --> 10:06.404
Alex, Eddie.
Well, I'm glad to see you're making friends.

10:06.405 --> 10:09.774
Why don't you and Mr. Creaser
join us for group?

10:09.775 --> 10:12.275
Please. Right this way.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.953
Actually, I'm gonna be putting you
in the afternoon group.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.454
What? Why?

10:23.455 --> 10:26.757
To be frank, the relationship
that you have with your brother...

10:26.758 --> 10:28.659
...seems dangerously codependent.

10:28.660 --> 10:32.721
I think a little time apart
will do you both good.

10:37.769 --> 10:41.539
All right, so-
So who would like to start us off?

10:44.376 --> 10:45.943
Anyone else?

10:45.944 --> 10:48.444
Mm-mm-mm.

10:48.780 --> 10:51.749
All right, Ted. Calm down.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.485
I am calm.

10:54.486 --> 10:58.022
And I'd very calmly like to talk
about the monster that's hunting us.

10:58.023 --> 11:00.825
Ted, we're not going to have
that discussion again.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.294
It's not good for group.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.795
I agree.

11:05.797 --> 11:08.299
You know what else
isn't good for group?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.802
- A monster eating all our faces off.
- All right, fine, thank you.

11:11.803 --> 11:14.939
- Now, anyone else?
- I saw it when it killed Susan.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.675
- I did too. It had big lobster claws.
- No, it didn't.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.777
Yeah, it was an alien, like on X-Files.

11:19.778 --> 11:21.979
Stop it. Stop helping.

11:21.980 --> 11:25.570
- Listen to me. We're all dead.
- That's enough.

11:30.722 --> 11:34.055
There is no monster.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.510
Now, Ted, do you need me
to call the orderlies...

11:38.797 --> 11:41.297
...or can you behave?

11:41.299 --> 11:43.799
Behave.

11:49.474 --> 11:51.475
King me. Ha-ha-ha.

11:51.476 --> 11:53.577
Eddie?

11:53.578 --> 11:56.447
I'm Dr. Erica Cartwright.
I've been assigned your case.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.349
You're my shrink?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.384
Heh. Lucky me.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.753
And you're my paranoid schizophrenic...

12:02.754 --> 12:06.657
...with narcissistic personality disorder
and religious psychosis.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.392
Lucky me.

12:08.393 --> 12:12.022
- Hmm.
- Can we talk?

12:12.597 --> 12:16.033
Yes. I've actually got
some questions for you.

12:16.201 --> 12:18.536
What a coincidence,
I've got some for you too.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.905
Well, then quid pro quo, Clarice.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.268
Okay, Hannibal. I'll go first.

12:25.477 --> 12:29.280
- How many hours a night do you sleep?
- Three or four every couple of nights.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.248
Tell me about the recent suicides.

12:31.249 --> 12:32.483
They were tragic.

12:32.484 --> 12:36.887
But you haven't noticed anything
strange, like black smoke, sulfur?

12:36.888 --> 12:39.023
No. Why?
What's that supposed to mean?

12:39.024 --> 12:42.626
Demon signs. I hunt demons,
monsters, that kind of thing.

12:42.627 --> 12:45.730
- How many drinks do you have a week?
- I gotta sleep sometime.

12:45.731 --> 12:48.032
So, what's seven days times-?

12:48.033 --> 12:50.533
Somewhere in the mid-50s.

12:50.535 --> 12:54.438
You ever feel any cold spots
or get a chill walking through the hospital?

12:54.439 --> 12:57.575
- Not that I can remember. If I had?
- There's a ghost around.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.877
Okay.

12:59.878 --> 13:03.748
When was the last time
you were in a long-term relationship?

13:03.749 --> 13:06.250
- Define "long-term. "
- More than two months.

13:06.251 --> 13:08.751
Never.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.422
Have the patients reported seeing
anything weird?

13:11.423 --> 13:13.923
In here? Heh. All the time.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.960
Right.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.954
So let's talk about your father.

13:31.743 --> 13:34.243
Dean. Hey.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.480
- You okay?
- I just got thraped.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.350
So, no, I am not okay.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.987
- Tell me you found something.
- Yeah, a guy says he saw the creature.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.756
We should talk to him.
Wanna meet here in an hour?

13:45.757 --> 13:48.559
Sooner we take care of this,
sooner we can get gone.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.060
This place gives me the creeps.

14:03.308 --> 14:05.509
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.010
- I'm Wendy.
- Uh-huh.

14:14.119 --> 14:19.329
- Maybe this place isn't so bad after all.
- Dude, you cannot hit that.

14:20.892 --> 14:23.392
Oh, so torn.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.901
It's about time.

14:30.902 --> 14:33.404
Nurses are on their rounds.
Got 15, 20 minutes.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.905
- Where is this guy?
- Room 306.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.060
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Back off, Dean.

15:20.685 --> 15:22.286
Hey. I found something.

15:22.287 --> 15:24.421
- What do you got?
- Right here.

15:24.422 --> 15:26.922
Give me a hand.

15:29.794 --> 15:32.294
All right.

15:44.209 --> 15:47.011
This hole
goes all the way through to his brain.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.779
What does that mean?

15:50.749 --> 15:53.650
Let's find out.
- Seriously?

15:54.252 --> 15:56.752
You might wanna keep watch.

16:22.414 --> 16:25.449
- Dude.
- Look, his brain's been sucked dry.

16:25.450 --> 16:28.140
That's fascinating. Somebody's coming.

16:44.202 --> 16:46.702
What are you boys doing in here?

16:53.712 --> 16:56.212
Pudding.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.715
All right, come on, you two.

17:02.587 --> 17:05.087
Crazy works.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.532
Are those original Gacys?

17:16.534 --> 17:18.167
I painted those.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.503
Back on point, please. Um...

17:20.505 --> 17:22.406
- Whatever this thing is-
- It's good.

17:22.406 --> 17:24.641
It Slurpees your brain, sucks you dry.

17:24.642 --> 17:27.978
Yeah, then it makes the deaths
look like suicides.

17:27.979 --> 17:30.479
Any ideas?

17:32.250 --> 17:34.051
Yeah.

17:34.052 --> 17:36.552
A bad one.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.355
What is it?

17:38.356 --> 17:43.626
Well, I bet you a chicken dinner
it's what we're up against, a Wraith.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.196
They crack open skulls
and feed on brain juice.

17:46.197 --> 17:49.033
- You ever tangle with one before?
- Never.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.534
Never wanted to, neither.

17:50.535 --> 17:53.368
- So how do we kill it?
- Silver.

17:53.538 --> 17:56.807
You touch a Wraith with the stuff,
the skin will crackle.

17:56.808 --> 17:58.275
That's the good news.

17:58.276 --> 18:01.326
The bad news is
they can pass as humans.

18:02.781 --> 18:06.150
It could be any Peter, Paul and Mary
in the joint.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.651
Fantastic. So how do we find it?

18:09.154 --> 18:11.422
A mirror.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.525
Lore says a Wraith will show
its true form in a mirror.

18:14.526 --> 18:17.394
We just gotta spot check
every patient, staff member.

18:17.395 --> 18:19.430
Okay. Yeah.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.399
But- I mean,
what's it doing in a mental hospital?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.600
A nuthouse is-

18:23.601 --> 18:25.536
It's a perfect captive victim pool.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.171
Sure.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.340
Who's gonna believe a patient
when they say they saw a monster?

18:30.341 --> 18:32.841
It's the perfect hunting ground.

18:44.722 --> 18:46.457
What's up, doc?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.958
You tell me.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.727
Hunting.

18:50.728 --> 18:52.796
A Wraith, actually.

18:52.797 --> 18:54.231
Could be anybody.

18:54.232 --> 18:56.962
So I could be a monster?

18:58.002 --> 19:00.502
No, you're clean.

19:01.372 --> 19:03.872
- Why you?
- Why me what?

19:03.942 --> 19:05.809
Why do you have to hunt monsters?

19:05.810 --> 19:08.310
Why not let someone else do it?

19:09.514 --> 19:12.142
Can't find anybody else that dumb.

19:16.287 --> 19:17.721
It's my job.

19:17.722 --> 19:21.715
Somebody's gotta save people's asses,
yours included.

19:21.893 --> 19:23.660
So is there a quota?

19:23.661 --> 19:26.029
How many people do you have to save?

19:26.030 --> 19:29.090
- All of them.
- All of them?

19:29.267 --> 19:32.536
- You have to save everyone?
- Yep. Whole wide world of sports.

19:32.537 --> 19:35.037
How?

19:36.808 --> 19:40.638
Believe me, whatever you've got,
I've heard weirder.

19:41.546 --> 19:44.344
It's the end of the world, okay?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.417
I mean, it's a damn biblical apocalypse...

19:47.418 --> 19:50.654
...and if I don't stop it
and save everyone, then no one will...

19:50.655 --> 19:52.689
...and we all die.

19:52.690 --> 19:55.190
That's horrible.

19:55.326 --> 19:56.793
Yeah, tell me about it.

19:56.794 --> 20:00.631
I mean, apocalypse or no apocalypse,
monsters or no monsters...

20:00.632 --> 20:03.901
...that's a crushing weight to have
on your shoulders.

20:03.902 --> 20:07.072
To feel like 6 billion lives depend on you.

20:07.972 --> 20:10.472
God...

20:10.475 --> 20:13.165
...how do you get up in the morning?

20:16.915 --> 20:19.415
That's a good question.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.718
Hello, Eddie.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.219
Doc.

20:36.734 --> 20:40.404
All right. I had to raid three
nurses' stations to get these.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.995
They're only silver-plated,
but they should work.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.443
Oh, no, no, no.

20:46.444 --> 20:49.674
Not today, sweetheart.
Come on, keep walking.

20:59.824 --> 21:02.952
I want him now. He's larger.

21:08.099 --> 21:10.599
Hmm.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.569
You've had worse.

21:15.540 --> 21:19.576
Fuller is on call tonight,
so we'll have to hit him after lights out.

21:19.577 --> 21:22.012
- All three of us.
- What? No.

21:22.013 --> 21:25.549
Martin, we gotta get past the security,
past the orderlies...

21:25.550 --> 21:27.284
...then cut the man's throat.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.953
It's gonna suck,
but we could use the backup.

21:29.954 --> 21:32.454
Oh, I can't. I can't.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.087
We know what happened in Albuquerque.

21:36.861 --> 21:39.361
You don't know the half of it.

21:39.764 --> 21:42.597
God, I used to be just like you two.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.634
I used to think I was invincible,
and then...

21:46.804 --> 21:48.272
Well, I found out I'm not.

21:48.273 --> 21:52.676
- Martin. You're still a hunter.
- No. I'm not. I'm useless.

21:52.677 --> 21:55.512
Why do you think I checked myself
into the hotel?

21:55.513 --> 21:58.880
I'd give anything to help you boys.
I would.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.218
But I- I can't.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.915
I'm sorry. I can't.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.168
He's still in the building.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.399
You take the west wing. I'll take the east.

23:27.171 --> 23:29.731
No. No. Look at his arm.

23:29.974 --> 23:32.474
The cut's not burning.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.977
It's not him. It's not him.

23:56.534 --> 23:58.902
You okay?

23:58.903 --> 24:02.862
No. No, I'm not okay.

24:03.107 --> 24:05.175
I-

24:05.176 --> 24:08.737
I am awesome.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.814
They give you something?

24:10.815 --> 24:13.807
Oh, yeah. They gave me everything.

24:14.018 --> 24:18.853
It's spectaculacular.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.925
You always were a happy drunk.

24:27.498 --> 24:31.264
Dean, the doctor wasn't a Wraith.

24:31.502 --> 24:34.403
I know. I don't understand it.

24:34.572 --> 24:37.140
I mean, I saw it in the mirror.
It wasn't human.

24:37.141 --> 24:39.641
Or you're seeing things.

24:39.744 --> 24:42.712
- Maybe you're going crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

24:42.713 --> 24:44.581
Well, come on-

24:44.582 --> 24:48.952
I mean, you've been at least half crazy
for a long time...

24:49.153 --> 24:52.155
...since you got back from hell,
or since before that even.

24:52.156 --> 24:53.557
I mean, we're in a-

24:53.558 --> 24:58.161
We're in a mental hospital, ha-ha-ha.
Maybe you finally cracked.

24:58.162 --> 25:04.567
You know,
maybe now you are really for real crazy.

25:04.735 --> 25:08.565
I made a mistake, that's all.
I'll find the thing.

25:08.606 --> 25:11.476
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

25:11.609 --> 25:14.578
It's okay. Hey, hey. Look at me.

25:15.079 --> 25:19.709
It's okay, because you're my brother...

25:20.785 --> 25:23.285
...and I still love you.

25:27.758 --> 25:30.258
Boop!

25:34.765 --> 25:37.467
- You missed our session today.
- A little busy.

25:37.468 --> 25:39.936
- Still hunting that Wraith?
- People are dying.

25:39.937 --> 25:41.938
People die all the time.

25:41.939 --> 25:44.608
Why don't you let me do my job,
maybe save your life.

25:44.609 --> 25:48.745
- It's not my life that I'm worried about.
- Oh, my- I am fine, okay?

25:48.746 --> 25:51.114
I'm fine.

25:51.115 --> 25:53.865
Come on, even you don't believe that.

25:53.985 --> 25:58.788
All this pressure that you're putting
yourself under, this guilt, it's killing you.

25:58.789 --> 26:01.986
You can't save everybody. You can't.

26:03.127 --> 26:05.629
Hell, these days
you can't save anybody, Dean.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.664
- What did you say?
- The truth, Dean.

26:07.665 --> 26:09.332
You got Ellen and Jo killed.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.434
Shot Lucifer, but you couldn't gank him.

26:11.435 --> 26:15.272
You couldn't stop Sam from killing Lilith,
and you broke the first seal.

26:15.273 --> 26:17.773
All you do is fail.

26:17.842 --> 26:20.977
Did you really think that you,
Dean Winchester, with a GED...

26:20.978 --> 26:25.248
...and a give-them-hell attitude,
were gonna beat the devil? Please.

26:25.249 --> 26:28.652
The world is gonna burn,
and there is nothing that you can do.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.703
Who are you?
How do you know that stuff?

26:32.456 --> 26:34.956
- Hey, settle down.
- Tell me.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.761
I said settle down.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.166
Who are you?

26:44.969 --> 26:48.302
- Who is she?
- Who?

26:48.472 --> 26:50.006
What are you, blind? Her.

26:50.007 --> 26:52.805
Pal, there's nobody there.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.618
I'm not real, Dean.

27:01.619 --> 27:04.119
I'm in your head...

27:04.488 --> 27:07.321
...because you are going crazy.

27:15.032 --> 27:17.532
Just leave me alone.

27:58.209 --> 28:01.576
- You asked to see me?
- Yeah. Thanks.

28:02.913 --> 28:05.382
I-

28:05.383 --> 28:09.719
I just wanted to apologize.
I feel horrible about what I did to you.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.220
I thought you were a monster.

28:12.723 --> 28:14.658
I know that.

28:14.659 --> 28:17.159
The question is, why?

28:18.629 --> 28:21.129
I was-

28:22.500 --> 28:24.401
It doesn't matter...

28:24.402 --> 28:26.636
...because after what happened
last night...

28:26.637 --> 28:29.731
...I had a moment of clarity.

28:30.675 --> 28:36.079
I realized
there's no such thing as monsters.

28:39.784 --> 28:45.381
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that,
but, honestly?

28:45.589 --> 28:48.519
Monsters are
the least of your problems.

28:49.527 --> 28:55.432
People can learn to live with delusions,
but the anger I saw in you...

28:55.599 --> 28:59.669
You hurt those two men,
and you were going to kill me.

29:00.137 --> 29:03.937
The look in your eyes
when you came after me, I-

29:04.542 --> 29:07.412
It was like you were barely even human.

29:10.681 --> 29:13.181
Like a man possessed.

29:17.655 --> 29:20.155
I know.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.160
Please...

29:26.197 --> 29:28.697
...just...

29:29.233 --> 29:31.827
Could you give me a second chance?

29:34.572 --> 29:36.372
Well, this isn't a prison.

29:36.373 --> 29:39.976
You'll be allowed to go to the day room,
under supervision.

29:39.977 --> 29:42.477
Thank you.

29:43.647 --> 29:46.277
But if there is one more outburst...

29:46.383 --> 29:51.488
...I will transfer you to a facility that
is equipped to handle violent patients.

29:51.489 --> 29:56.483
And, believe me,
they will be far, far less forgiving.

30:04.335 --> 30:07.862
Dean? Hey. Oh. What's wrong?

30:09.206 --> 30:12.903
It's not the demon blood, Sam.
It never was.

30:13.110 --> 30:14.544
What?

30:14.545 --> 30:17.045
The problem was you.

30:17.214 --> 30:18.581
It was always you.

30:18.582 --> 30:20.416
The lies.

30:20.417 --> 30:21.751
Your arrogance.

30:21.752 --> 30:24.087
The black spot on your soul.

30:24.088 --> 30:26.356
Now we're all gonna die
because of you.

30:26.357 --> 30:28.491
- It's your fault.
You killed all of us.

30:28.492 --> 30:30.994
- Pathetic freak.
- You evil son of a bitch.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.762
- Loser.
Grow up and die.

30:32.763 --> 30:34.898
Freak.

30:43.207 --> 30:45.707
Leave me alone.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.911
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.879
No. Stop it.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.514
Leave me alone.

30:51.515 --> 30:54.317
Leave me alone. I didn't do it.
Get off of me.

30:54.318 --> 30:56.419
Leave me alone.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.755
Get off. No.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.790
Leave me alone.

31:00.791 --> 31:05.827
What's happening?

31:18.142 --> 31:21.852
- Martin. Martin, it's me. It's Dean.
- Oh, sorry.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.810
You- You look like hell, boy.

31:25.983 --> 31:27.584
I feel like it too.

31:27.585 --> 31:30.053
- Where's Sam?
- Lockdown.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.988
He went crazy. Thank God.

31:31.989 --> 31:34.489
- What?
- I'm going crazy too.

31:35.159 --> 31:39.095
I'm seeing things. I'm hearing things.
We both are.

31:39.763 --> 31:42.753
- Crazy is the clue.
- What do you mean?

31:46.170 --> 31:48.271
- Dean?
- Crazy is the clue.

31:48.272 --> 31:50.006
You said that. What?

31:50.007 --> 31:52.442
I mean,
the things that me and Sam have done...

31:52.443 --> 31:56.079
...the stuff that we've seen, we're
gonna end up going guano eventually.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.850
Probably end up
like a couple of drooling nut bags.

32:00.150 --> 32:02.675
- No offense.
- None taken.

32:03.287 --> 32:06.089
But me and him
freaking out on the same day?

32:06.090 --> 32:09.025
- I mean, it's gotta be-
- The monster.

32:09.026 --> 32:12.495
- What? Where? Where?
- Not- No, there's nothing there.

32:12.496 --> 32:14.996
Okay.

32:16.467 --> 32:19.102
What if this thing
doesn't just feed on the insane?

32:19.103 --> 32:22.095
What if it makes people insane?

32:23.841 --> 32:26.591
Is that possible? Does that seem real?

32:27.912 --> 32:33.544
Well, I'm not the most reliable source
on what is real, but it sounds-

32:33.717 --> 32:36.052
- It makes sense.
- Okay.

32:36.053 --> 32:38.553
Okay. So we got infected.

32:38.656 --> 32:42.666
Something shot us up with crazy.
You know, something...

32:44.395 --> 32:46.729
Maybe-

32:46.730 --> 32:50.029
- Maybe it's the ghost of my dad.
- No.

32:50.567 --> 32:52.068
Focus on the Wraith, Dean.

32:52.069 --> 32:54.070
- Focus.
- Right, the Wraith.

32:54.071 --> 32:57.601
Okay. So the Wraith, the Wraith,
it poisoned us.

32:57.908 --> 33:00.408
Yeah. Maybe with venom, you know?

33:00.411 --> 33:02.879
By touch, or-

33:02.880 --> 33:06.407
Or venom, or saliva.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.053
- Wendy.
- Wendy?

33:10.054 --> 33:15.356
Wendy. Wendy slobbered all over me
and Sam. That's how we got infected.

33:30.407 --> 33:32.907
Dean.

33:34.411 --> 33:36.911
I can't step on the cracks.

33:50.294 --> 33:52.794
Is this real?

34:02.106 --> 34:04.407
Oh, it is, sugar.

34:04.408 --> 34:06.908
It's very real.

34:43.981 --> 34:46.481
She's still alive.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.217
There's two patients in Wendy's room.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.719
They attacked me.

34:57.494 --> 35:00.184
Dean? Can you hear me? Dean.

35:01.298 --> 35:04.634
You've gotta get out there
and kill that thing.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.135
I'll take care of her.

35:08.772 --> 35:11.007
- I can't.
- You have to.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.508
You have no choice, son.

35:15.646 --> 35:19.946
Go. Dean, run. Run.

35:42.272 --> 35:44.772
Hey. Let me go.

35:45.476 --> 35:50.026
No. You are far too angry
to be out there in the real world.

35:52.916 --> 35:55.416
- You.
- Of course, it's me.

35:55.953 --> 35:59.989
I gotta say, you hunters
don't exactly live up to your rep.

35:59.990 --> 36:02.980
I mean, Martin's a wreck. He's harmless.

36:03.127 --> 36:07.330
And you and your brother come in here,
talking tough about killing monsters...

36:07.331 --> 36:09.831
...kind of made you easy to spot.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.900
Then all it took was a touch...

36:15.472 --> 36:17.972
...and you were mine.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.742
Oh, I love it in here.

36:21.812 --> 36:24.981
This place
is my own personal five-star restaurant.

36:27.117 --> 36:29.152
Mm.

36:29.153 --> 36:30.786
Crazy brains.

36:30.787 --> 36:34.780
They get soaked in dopamine
and adrenaline...

36:34.992 --> 36:39.842
...and all sorts of hormones
and chemicals that make them delicious.

36:41.498 --> 36:44.867
And the crazier they are,
the better they taste.

36:44.868 --> 36:47.368
You did this to me.

36:47.938 --> 36:51.135
Well, I helped, but that rage?

36:51.341 --> 36:53.109
No, no, no. That's all you.

36:53.110 --> 36:57.420
I don't make crazy.
I just crank up what's already there.

36:57.447 --> 37:01.217
You build your own hell,
but I give you the Legos.

37:01.585 --> 37:04.085
And when you're ripe...

37:05.022 --> 37:08.287
...I make all of your problems disappear.

37:11.662 --> 37:14.130
You get away from him.

37:14.131 --> 37:18.167
Do you really think this is gonna end well
for you, kiddo?

37:18.168 --> 37:20.668
No.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.899
But I'm crazy, so, what the hell?

38:26.770 --> 38:29.270
You still crazy?

38:31.074 --> 38:33.574
Not any more than usual.

38:34.111 --> 38:35.878
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah.

38:48.425 --> 38:52.615
Well, looks like Tom Cruise
was right. Shrinks suck.

38:53.630 --> 38:55.464
What are you doing?

38:55.465 --> 38:57.900
Sam? You okay?

38:57.901 --> 39:00.831
- No. No. The Wraith-
- What about her?

39:01.338 --> 39:03.573
- She was right.
- No, she wasn't.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.007
She's dead, okay?

39:05.008 --> 39:07.143
Let's hit the road. I need a drink or 12.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.278
Most of the time I can hide it...

39:09.279 --> 39:11.779
...but I am angry.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.849
I'm mad at everything.

39:13.850 --> 39:16.285
I used to be mad at you and Dad,
then Lilith...

39:16.286 --> 39:18.321
...now it's Lucifer, and I make excuses.

39:18.322 --> 39:21.524
I blame Ruby or the demon blood,
but it's not their fault.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.526
It's not them. It's me.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.394
It's inside me.

39:25.395 --> 39:27.263
I'm mad...

39:27.264 --> 39:29.764
...all the time...

39:29.933 --> 39:32.034
...and I don't know why.

39:32.035 --> 39:34.731
Stop. Stop it.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.809
So what if you are?

39:39.810 --> 39:42.678
What are you gonna do?
You gonna take a leave of absence?

39:42.679 --> 39:45.047
You gonna say yes to Lucifer? What?

39:45.048 --> 39:47.618
- No, of course not. I-
- Exactly.

39:48.885 --> 39:50.386
That's what you're gonna do.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.955
You're gonna take all that crap
and bury it.

39:52.956 --> 39:55.825
You're gonna forget it,
because that's how we keep going.

39:55.826 --> 39:58.954
That's how we don't end up like Martin.

40:01.865 --> 40:04.365
Are you with me?

40:05.068 --> 40:07.568
Come on, man. Are you with me?

40:10.073 --> 40:12.573
I'm with you.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.543
Good.

40:17.981 --> 40:20.481
Let's get the hell out of here.
