00:00.001 --> 00:01.868
[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter</i> .

00:01.869 --> 00:03.736
[FIVE] Something really bad
happened to you there.

00:03.738 --> 00:06.138
W-Why would you
ever wanna go back?

00:06.140 --> 00:08.107
I may not have a choice.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.275
I own a company
called Dwarf Star Technologies

00:10.277 --> 00:13.545
which owns Rebecca,
who you know as Portia.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.648
You know, she was created
right here in this facility.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.253
[ROOK] Although Rebecca's
biological components

00:21.255 --> 00:24.790
are superior, she must be
constantly monitored

00:24.792 --> 00:27.159
and maintained by her nanites.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.190
I was thinking...
it might be better

00:58.192 --> 01:01.260
if we kept this between us.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.063
It was one night,
and it was nice,

01:04.065 --> 01:05.464
and I'm not saying
it won't happen again,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.066
but I don't think either
of us should assume--

01:07.068 --> 01:08.634
Of course not.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.737
Listen, I enjoy your company.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.639
And I enjoy yours.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.741
Let's leave it at that.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.809
I just wanted to make sure--

01:16.811 --> 01:19.278
Can we stop talking about this?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.679
Okay.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.702
Wow, you two were really
going at it last night.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.304
--[NYX] Pardon?
--What?

01:47.141 --> 01:49.374
I passed you sparring
in the training room

01:49.376 --> 01:52.578
on the way back to
my quarters after dinner?

01:52.580 --> 01:55.514
Yeah, we were,
um, training late.

01:55.516 --> 01:59.852
[NYX] Yeah, bow staffs
and, um, swords.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.661
You guys moved on up
to grappling?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.769
Okay, um...

02:17.771 --> 02:19.371
I'm done.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.184
[beeping]

02:35.256 --> 02:36.655
Two, where are you?

02:40.928 --> 02:43.529
[sighs]

02:43.531 --> 02:44.930
[knocking]

03:00.748 --> 03:02.347
I need help.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.526
How do you feel?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.329
I'm fine.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.599
[THE ANDROID]
But... you're not.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.734
[TWO]
What're you talking about?

03:22.736 --> 03:26.772
Your nanites, they're in a
critical stage of failure.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.240
What does that mean?

03:28.242 --> 03:31.210
[THE ANDROID]
I'm sorry, Two.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.611
You're dying.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.936
[NYX] And so your nanites
are what gives you

03:57.938 --> 04:00.272
your special abilities.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.442
They also serve the basic
function of keeping me alive.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.911
But now they're powering down.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.647
Apparently it's been
happening for a while now.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.516
A slow progression that
manifested no symptoms

04:11.518 --> 04:14.319
until their decline reached
a critical threshold.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.888
That's when I started
showing signs.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.358
If they shut down
completely, one by one,

04:19.360 --> 04:22.261
my organs will fail.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.762
The simple fact is,
my body was not designed

04:23.764 --> 04:25.297
to function without them.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.666
Why hasn't the robot come up
with something, huh?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.668
You need nanites;
she's got nanites.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.336
It doesn't work like that.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.273
We're talking about completely
different nanite designs.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.944
Look, the solution to my
problem is not on this ship.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.612
It's here.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.851
Back when I had the neural
link, Five confronted me

04:45.853 --> 04:47.786
in one of my memories.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.720
I had just escaped from the
lab where I was constructed,

04:49.723 --> 04:52.457
and we were in this alleyway.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.327
This building was
in the background.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.964
It's the corporate headquarters
for Dwarf Star Technologies.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.667
If there's any hope for me,
that's where I'll find it.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.503
So, that's where I'm going.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.372
Hey, you're not
going anywhere.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.808
[SIX]
You said it yourself.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.576
You're weak, disoriented.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.129
At best, you're a non-factor.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.681
At worst, you jeopardize any
shot we have at fixing this.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.852
You know, it's okay to let
others take care of you

05:20.854 --> 05:22.454
once in a while.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.475
Yeah, fine.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.843
Fine...

05:46.714 --> 05:48.113
We're going to Earth.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.670
Raza, you seeing this?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.641
Whoa.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.977
That's a space elevator.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.780
Where does it go?

06:25.386 --> 06:26.952
According to the
short range scanners,

06:26.954 --> 06:30.789
it leads to a small space
station in geosynchronous orbit.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.758
All right, we're
going down for recon.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.559
[FIVE]
Copy that.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.861
Well, once we're
parked, me and Nyx

06:35.863 --> 06:37.746
will check the place out.

06:37.747 --> 06:39.630
You stay back in the
Marauder with Four.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.945
[TWO] You're not gonna
learn anything new, are you?

06:53.947 --> 06:56.448
Are you suggesting
I'm wasting our time?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.816
No.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.418
I think in your mind,
you're putting it

06:59.420 --> 07:02.020
to the best use possible,
all things considered.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.558
You're trying to give me
hope, take my mind off

07:06.560 --> 07:08.727
of what's going on
down on that planet.

07:08.729 --> 07:12.497
That would be atypical
android behavior.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.667
But it would be perfectly
normal behavior for a friend.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.172
[TWO] I appreciate you,
everyone looking out for me.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.774
But I can't just
stand by and do nothing.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.945
Look, I know that my current
state makes me a liability,

07:26.947 --> 07:30.482
but I'm wondering if there's
anything that you can do for me.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.983
I wish I could, Two, but--

07:31.985 --> 07:33.585
[TWO]
I-I know you can't solve this.

07:33.587 --> 07:36.555
So all I'm asking for
is a temporary fix.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.490
Something that'll let me
do more than just sit back

07:38.492 --> 07:41.493
on this ship while the others
risk their lives for me.

07:41.495 --> 07:44.095
I don't believe the others
have a problem with that.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.766
[TWO] Maybe not,
but I sure as hell do.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.668
I need options.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.015
[SIX sighs]

08:04.017 --> 08:06.518
A short while ago,
he'd have sooner killed you

08:06.520 --> 08:10.121
than permitted you to
accompany us on a mission.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.890
If you say so.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.126
You didn't think it would
be that easy, did you?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.895
Of course not.

08:18.165 --> 08:22.133
A practical argument can be
made for keeping you on board.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.169
Practical enough
to convince you?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.705
I understand why
you did what you did.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.843
[FOUR]
Divided loyalties, I empathize.

08:31.845 --> 08:36.081
My home world is about
to lose an interplanetary war.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.651
And defeat will cost it
for generations to come.

08:39.653 --> 08:43.288
And all I can do
is watch it happen.

08:44.858 --> 08:49.895
No, my place is with my people,
not sitting idle on a spaceship.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.130
So you're actually
thinking of leaving.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.869
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't consider it.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.738
Then what's stopping you?

08:59.740 --> 09:03.575
[FOUR] A sense of duty,
loyalty to this crew.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.210
So friendship.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.312
And the fact that
without my memories,

09:07.314 --> 09:10.081
I have nothing to offer Zairon.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.762
[THREE]
Hi.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.630
We're in the lobby, testing.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.032
[FIVE]
Copy that.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.102
[THREE]
How's the view?

09:31.104 --> 09:33.805
Eyes and ears.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.206
You're on.

09:41.782 --> 09:42.781
[NYX in British accent]
Good afternoon.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.616
I'm here to see Mr. Rook.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.017
ID?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.398
No.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.966
Sorry, you're not in the system.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.034
Well, there must be a mistake.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.636
Can you check again?

10:04.638 --> 10:07.372
I'm telling you,
your name isn't here.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.644
We're in.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.079
[NYX in British accent] I'm not
leaving until I see Mr. Rook.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.720
Fine.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.258
You seeing this?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.231
[FIVE]
Yeah, retinal scans.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.635
It's not gonna be
an easy smash and grab.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.813
So how do we get
in from up here?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.249
[THE ANDROID] It's not equipped
with docking capabilities

10:51.251 --> 10:54.019
or anything else that
would allow for access.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.353
It's highly secure.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.822
There's no possible way
to enter the station

10:57.824 --> 10:58.957
while in orbit.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.325
Which means the only
way in is by way

11:00.327 --> 11:01.426
of the space elevator.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.895
And how do we
get on that elevator?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.800
[FIVE] You catch a lift
with him, Eric Waver.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.168
According to
the company database,

11:10.170 --> 11:13.171
he's been with their R&D
division for over ten years.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.173
Which means he was probably
there on the station

11:15.175 --> 11:16.875
when I escaped.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.677
Well, maybe we won't have to
access the space station

11:18.679 --> 11:21.746
after all if he has
the answers we're looking for.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.982
[THE ANDROID] In the event he
doesn't, I'm working on a way

11:23.984 --> 11:27.218
to circumvent Dwarf Star's
retinal scan technology.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.720
How you gonna manage that?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.221
[THE ANDROID]
By using the infirmary's repair

11:30.223 --> 11:32.924
and reconstructive
technology in conjunction

11:32.926 --> 11:34.959
with some of the
illegal criminal devices

11:34.961 --> 11:37.328
I've been cataloging
from the store room.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.030
I need to see that list.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.466
Five's got Waver's address.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.134
We'll take the Marauder down.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.103
You're in no condition
to come with us.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.337
You agreed.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.274
My situation has
changed temporarily.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.042
The Android's figured
out a way to boost

11:51.044 --> 11:53.061
the power to my nanites.

11:53.062 --> 11:55.079
For the next 24 hours,
I'm at maximum charge.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.199
I'm stronger than ever.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.317
[FOUR] And what happens
after that 24 hours is up?

11:59.453 --> 12:02.921
[THE ANDROID] Her nanites
will shut down completely.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.190
Her death will be immediate.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.759
Why would you do that?

12:07.761 --> 12:12.363
Because I'm not going
to die a slow death.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.899
If I'm going out,
I'm going out fighting.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.110
[ERIC]
Interests: cooking, dancing.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.381
[beeping]

12:40.861 --> 12:42.327

Can I help you?

12:42.329 --> 12:43.862
Galactic Authority.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.230
Lieutenant Kal Varrick.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.465
I'd like to speak to
Eric Waver.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.134
Yeah, uh, that's me.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.436
Uh, what is this about?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.838
I'll need maybe
20 minutes of your time.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.007
[ERIC] Can I at least know
why I'm being questioned?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.810
Sir, we can talk here
or down at the station.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.111
Your choice.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.546
Okay, hang on.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.284
Come on in.

13:07.921 --> 13:08.953
Hey.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.321
Whoa, wh-what's going on?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.090
Wh-What do you guys want?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.130
Rebecca.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.333
You're a part of the team
that created me, weren't you?

13:22.335 --> 13:23.268
Yes.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.069
But you're not afraid.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.471
Why not?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.542
Because you spared me.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.078
The night you escaped.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.085
[ERIC] You were our
first successful prototype,

13:41.087 --> 13:45.523
a bio-engineered human
capable of self-sustainment

13:45.525 --> 13:47.125
and sentience.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.361
[ERIC] You were subjected
to a battery of tests

13:50.363 --> 13:53.298
designed to assess your limits.

13:53.300 --> 13:58.236
Force your nanites to
respond and push past them.

13:58.238 --> 14:02.106
You surpassed
all expectations.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.076
Unfortunately, that just
emboldened our research team

14:05.078 --> 14:06.878
to push you further.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.281
[ERIC]
It wasn't easy to watch.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.484
[ERIC]
It was torture for you.

14:18.024 --> 14:22.560
[ERIC] I was a junior member
of the research team,

14:22.562 --> 14:25.463
tasked with the
most basic duties.

14:25.465 --> 14:32.036
One of which, feeding you,
had an unintended consequence.

14:34.074 --> 14:37.442
[ERIC]
It allowed us to bond.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.944
Which, in turn, resulted
in me being charged

14:39.946 --> 14:44.315
with another duty--
your education.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.618
[ERIC]
You learned.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.355
You grew smarter.

14:50.357 --> 14:55.026
And, unbeknownst to us,
more dangerous.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.504
[ERIC]
We never saw it coming.

15:08.642 --> 15:15.313
[ERIC] When you broke free,
you were brutally efficient.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.351
[ERIC] It was like you were
proving yourself to them

15:20.353 --> 15:24.055
one last time,
one final test.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.959
[ERIC]
You killed them all.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.231
[ERIC] The research team,
uh, technicians,

15:33.233 --> 15:38.603
security personnel,
everyone on that station,

15:38.605 --> 15:40.204
except me.

15:41.241 --> 15:45.944
It's true what Alex said
about your missing memories.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.979
What else did Rook tell you?

15:47.981 --> 15:51.015
[ERIC] That you had friends
now, dangerous associates,

15:51.017 --> 15:53.117
and that you'd come back.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.054
You know about your nanites.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.489
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.992
It wasn't until several
months after your escape

16:00.994 --> 16:02.460
that we discovered that
the first generation

16:02.462 --> 16:04.062
nanorobotics were flawed.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.964
They were bleeding
an almost infinitesimal

16:05.966 --> 16:07.966
amount of energy over time.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.234
And that's when we realized
that sooner or later,

16:10.236 --> 16:13.972
they would all deteriorate
and shut down.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.974
But you fixed
the issue, didn't you?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.626
Yes.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.277
Yes, we improved the internal
design and we perfected

16:19.279 --> 16:22.113
a self-sufficiently
generated version.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.182
Where is it?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.617
It's in the research lab
up on the space station.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.569
[TWO]
Good.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.520
You're gonna take me up there,
and we'll go get them.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.223
No, uh, no.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.325
Y-You'd be identified
before you got anywhere

16:34.327 --> 16:36.361
near those elevators.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.062
Then I'll go.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.430
I can handle this one alone.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.232
[TWO]
No.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.434
You'll go together.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.603
Please.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.606
Fine.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.441
Okay...

16:50.443 --> 16:52.010
[ERIC] Uh, you can't
get up there without

16:52.012 --> 16:55.513
passing a retinal scan,
and you need identification.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.714
[SIX] Yeah, we're
gonna need you to call

16:56.716 --> 16:58.750
a couple of your coworkers,

16:58.752 --> 17:00.752
catch them on the
way home from work.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.320
M-My coworkers?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.422
Ah... Uh, No.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.724
I-I-I can't.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.593
I won't.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.063
You don't have a choice, buddy.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.367
Hey.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.819
Come on in.

17:17.820 --> 17:19.270
Well, Fists of Curry
was closed,

17:19.272 --> 17:22.173
so we had to take out from
House of Frying Daggers instead.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.574
Hope that's okay.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.380
What the hell, Eric?
What is this?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.315
He didn't have a choice.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.683
Wait, you're--

17:32.685 --> 17:34.252
Oh my god, you're Rebecca.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.219
Please don't kill us.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.755
[TWO]
Sit down.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.223
I'm not gonna kill you.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.526
I just need your help.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.461
We need your retinas.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.163
Oh, god...

17:57.610 --> 17:59.177
I should warn you
that rather than helping

17:59.179 --> 18:02.413
to calm one's nerves,
coffee acts as a stimulant.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.614
It's not coffee.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.516
It's hot chocolate.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.319
I picked it up on our
last station stopover.

18:12.459 --> 18:15.126
Hot chocolate?

18:15.128 --> 18:16.394
[FIVE]
Mm-hmm.

18:16.395 --> 18:17.661
Did you know that I
possess over 20 million

18:17.664 --> 18:19.430
taste receptors?

18:19.432 --> 18:23.101
Uh, do you want a sip?

18:23.103 --> 18:24.502
Okay.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.741
Interesting.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.551
Six reports they've come in
contact with the lead scientist.

18:40.553 --> 18:44.155
He remains confident in their
probability for success.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.193
You're worried.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.564
Of course I'm worried.

18:53.566 --> 18:58.136
In the past, she's been
almost invincible.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.637
I mean, I saw her
come back from the dead

18:59.639 --> 19:01.639
that time she was
blasted out the airlock,

19:01.641 --> 19:04.675
but that was because
of her nanites.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.882
And now instead of saving her,
they're gonna kill her.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.217
No, they won't.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.287
She won't let that happen.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.423
What makes Two special
isn't her nanites.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.827
It's her strength of will,
her ability to face adversity

19:22.829 --> 19:24.862
and never give up.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.799
Thanks.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.302
I feel a little better.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.815
She'll be fine.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.798
[TWO]
Hold still.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.270
[TWO]
Okay, who's up?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.842
How does this work exactly?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.945
[TWO] According to The Android,
it scans a retina,

20:13.947 --> 20:15.580
mapping out its unique pattern.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.782
This template gets imprinted
onto an organic gel,

20:17.784 --> 20:20.318
which gets injected
under your cornea.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.652
Are you kidding me?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.988
I know. That is so cool.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.624
The compound eventually
breaks down

20:26.626 --> 20:28.259
and is absorbed by your body.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.430
All right.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.232
Let's do it.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.701
Don't blink.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.602
That's amazing.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.636
Can you not?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.238
I'm sorry.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.575
[GNN REPORTER] In what some are
referring to as a colossal blow,

20:44.577 --> 20:47.378
forces from the Republic
of Pyr have retaken

20:47.380 --> 20:49.513
Enriss Sector,
scoring yet another

20:49.515 --> 20:53.517
decisive military victory
in their war against Zairon.

20:53.519 --> 20:56.320
Emperor Hiro Ishida described
the loss of the contested

20:56.322 --> 20:59.724
region as a temporary setback,
but sources within the palace

20:59.726 --> 21:03.928
reveal a royal court beset
by confusion and self-doubt.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.931
The execution of two more
Generals followed news

21:06.933 --> 21:09.433
of the defeat, bringing
to 12 the total number

21:09.435 --> 21:12.403
of high-ranking officials
who have paid the ultimate price

21:12.405 --> 21:16.474
for what Zairon's empress has
termed "a failure of spirit."

21:29.522 --> 21:31.656
Just in case you were thinking
of tipping anyone off,

21:31.658 --> 21:34.792
remember your friends are still
hanging out with Rebecca.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.601
Hey.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.362
Come on.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.630
Hey.

22:20.473 --> 22:21.706
Try it again.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.075
Okay.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.982
[sighs]

22:35.521 --> 22:37.621
It's been a little fussy
since the upgrade.

22:37.623 --> 22:38.489
Yeah.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.690
Technology, huh?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.135
[SIX]
And how many will she need?

23:24.136 --> 23:25.536
A single injection will
deliver more than enough

23:25.538 --> 23:27.772
second-generation
nanites to do the job.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.006
They'll replicate,
they'll disperse

23:29.008 --> 23:31.008
through her bloodstream
in seconds.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.077
Just to be on the safe side...

23:40.820 --> 23:45.589
Gentlemen, welcome
to Dwarf Star Technologies.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.158
I've been expecting you.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.167
If you're gonna lock us up,
I'm gonna need a pillow.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.102
That can be arranged.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.805
But first, I'm gonna need to
know where I can find her.

24:01.874 --> 24:04.742
Who?

24:04.744 --> 24:06.010
Where's Rebecca?

24:06.012 --> 24:08.212
--Oh.
--She's not with us.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.881
Nope.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.549
No, she's nowhere
near this place.

24:11.551 --> 24:15.119
[ALEX]
Hmm.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.755
Is she feeling a little ill?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.028
Yeah, her nanites are failing.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.664
And this was only
a matter of time.

24:26.666 --> 24:32.970
She is going to die a very slow
and very horrible death

24:32.972 --> 24:34.905
without this.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.877
Eric...

24:43.716 --> 24:46.984
I am incredibly
disappointed in you.

24:48.855 --> 24:52.089
You always had such an
unhealthy affection for her.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.926
He had no choice.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.127
We all have choices.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.865
[SIX] In this case,
it was help us or die.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.534
[ALEX]
Is that true, Eric?

25:03.536 --> 25:06.270
Were you in fear for your life?

25:09.041 --> 25:12.543
Yes. I was afraid.

25:12.545 --> 25:13.944
Sorry.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.748
That's okay.

25:17.750 --> 25:20.618
Hey, hey, hey.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.588
There is no shame
in wanting to live.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.525
[ALEX]
It's all right.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.161
Take him out?

25:45.177 --> 25:46.810
[gunshot]

25:50.650 --> 25:52.583
I probably should have
phrased that differently.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.269
[SIX]
You son of a bitch.

25:55.270 --> 25:57.954
[ALEX] Even if he was
an unwilling participant,

25:57.957 --> 26:00.624
what kind of example am I
setting for my other employees

26:00.626 --> 26:03.627
if I let him just
walk out of here?

26:03.629 --> 26:08.632
Loyalty is an extremely
important part of my business.

26:09.635 --> 26:12.803
[THREE] Oh, I am really
gonna enjoy killing you.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.572
Well, you know what?

26:14.574 --> 26:16.874
I don't think I'm going
to give you that pillow.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.067
[TWO]
I should've gone.

26:27.068 --> 26:29.118
No, facial recog would've
nabbed you in a second.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.722
[COWORKER B] You're pretty
high priority around there.

26:31.724 --> 26:34.758
They've been gone too long.
We should've heard back by now.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.327
I'm gonna go back to the ship.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.631
How much time does
she have left?

26:40.633 --> 26:42.249
I dunno.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.866
She said she had 24 hours,
but if we don't find a way

26:43.869 --> 26:45.202
to fix this soon...

26:48.107 --> 26:50.741
You, let's go.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.152
They've been gone too long.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.721
Something's happened to them.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.089
Then let's go get them.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.857
There's no way we're
getting anyone past

27:06.859 --> 27:08.943
that security checkpoint.

27:08.944 --> 27:11.028
If they've been caught, that
place is in full lockdown now.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.262
[FOUR] So then we don't
take the elevator.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.031
We find another way in.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.033
There is no other way in.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.369
Actually, there may be.

27:18.371 --> 27:22.906
My earlier scans confirmed
no other access points.

27:22.908 --> 27:26.877
However, this section was
a designed hangar area

27:26.879 --> 27:30.280
subsequently sealed off
upon the station's completion.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.183
It's large enough to
accommodate the Marauder.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.719
How does that help us?
We don't have an entry point.

27:35.721 --> 27:37.187
You don't need one.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.891
We use the Blink Drive.

27:40.893 --> 27:41.992
[THE ANDROID]
I believe I can adapt it

27:41.994 --> 27:44.328
to the Marauder's engine.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.764
We just... pop in.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.310
I need you to tell me
where I can find Rebecca.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.814
So that you can, what,
help her out?

28:03.816 --> 28:09.019
Now, I can save her.
But I need you to let me.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.922
With all due disrespect,

28:11.924 --> 28:13.357
go to hell.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.063
Hook him up.

28:33.345 --> 28:36.246
In case I don't get
the chance to say it:

Thank you.

It worked.

I'll go after the nanites.

Do you know where
they're located?

29:39.812 --> 29:42.346
I know what, I know
where, and I know how.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.515

were happy to help.

Two's on the clock, and we're no
good to her just sitting here.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.488
No, no.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.089
[SIX]
All right.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.230
[ALEX]
It's not there anymore.

30:50.231 --> 30:51.981
[ALEX] You understand that
I can't give it to you, right?

30:51.984 --> 30:57.621
You represent a professional
failure for me, Rebecca.

30:57.623 --> 31:00.858
And if I just had you
running around,

31:00.860 --> 31:03.994
it would make me
look really bad.

31:03.996 --> 31:06.296
And I... I just
hate looking bad.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.598
Where is it?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.600
It doesn't matter.

31:09.602 --> 31:11.301
Your time is up.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.211
Personal shield,
one of many wonderful

31:21.213 --> 31:23.280
technologies developed
by Dwarf Star's

31:23.282 --> 31:25.182
research and
development department.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.985
Like the damping field
I used to negate

31:27.987 --> 31:30.454
your nanites the
last time we met.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.089
And I could've used that again,

31:32.091 --> 31:35.259
but I thought,
"What a great opportunity

31:35.261 --> 31:38.228
to demonstrate
my new prototype?"

31:38.230 --> 31:40.197
Would you like to
meet the new you?

31:56.248 --> 31:58.315
[ALEX]
Faster, stronger,

31:58.317 --> 32:00.217
and possessed of an
advanced version of the

32:00.219 --> 32:03.086
nanites teeming within you.

32:03.555 --> 32:08.625
[ALEX] Oh, and best of all,
he is completely loyal.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.030
[BOTH grunting]

32:13.699 --> 32:15.599
[SIX groaning]

32:25.110 --> 32:26.576
You coming?

32:26.578 --> 32:27.711
[SIX]
Let's go.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.313
Come on.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.284
[BOTH grunting]

32:46.465 --> 32:48.065
[TWO groans]

33:18.330 --> 33:19.730
[TWO yells]

33:25.204 --> 33:27.270
[NYX grunting]

33:53.032 --> 33:55.399
[FOUR] I'd like to see
his nanites repair that.

33:55.401 --> 33:58.268
Hey, hey. Easy, easy.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.669
I got you.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.706
[SIX]
The nanites?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.674
He took them.

34:04.676 --> 34:05.709
It's too late.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.044
--[NYX] No...
--[SIX] No.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.578
Hey, hey!

34:08.580 --> 34:11.181
Hey, no! Two. Two...

34:11.183 --> 34:12.582
No, no, no, no...

34:15.387 --> 34:16.787
[SIX]
No...

34:34.406 --> 34:36.139
[NYX]
What're you looking for?

34:40.813 --> 34:42.279
[THREE]
What're you doing?

34:42.281 --> 34:43.814
[SIX]
Drawing blood.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.552
[SIX] Finding the
quickest way to get this

34:48.554 --> 34:50.287
into her bloodstream.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.857
The prototypes already have
the second generation nanites.

34:53.859 --> 34:56.526
According to Eric,
we just need a small sample

34:56.528 --> 34:57.761
to start the process.

35:07.139 --> 35:07.838
[gasps]

35:07.840 --> 35:09.506
[SIX]
Hey!

35:09.508 --> 35:11.341
Hey, hey...

35:11.343 --> 35:13.276
Welcome back.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.160
[FIVE]
So you're gonna be okay?

35:30.162 --> 35:32.562
We are gonna be fine.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.292
The new nanites have replicated
and integrated fully

36:02.294 --> 36:03.493
throughout your system.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.694
And the old ones?

36:04.696 --> 36:07.330
They're inert and
in a state of decay.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.833
You're going to be fine, Two.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.434
I'm relieved.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.607
Hey.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.643
How you feeling?

36:19.644 --> 36:21.678
A lot better thanks to you
and everyone else on this ship.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.680
[SIX] Well, like Five
says, we're family.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.315
We take care of
each other, right?

36:25.317 --> 36:26.383
Right.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.852
Right...

36:31.423 --> 36:34.925
[SIX] Hey, listen, I need to
talk to you about Three.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.860
What about him?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.929
He's... not himself.

37:01.486 --> 37:02.886
[SIX]
Hey.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.622
What're you doing down here?

37:20.906 --> 37:22.872
Let's get him
to the infirmary.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.651
[THREE]
What the hell's going on here?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.586
You tell us.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.455
What did Rook do to you?

37:40.492 --> 37:42.525
I dunno what
you're talking about.

37:45.264 --> 37:47.464
What did he tell you?

37:47.466 --> 37:48.398
He's betrayed us once.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.634
He can't be trusted.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.302
He's not the one
I'm worried about.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.470
[THE ANDROID]
Strange.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.272
Although he's awake,
his neural activity

37:55.274 --> 37:57.941
is consistent with REM sleep.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.811
Something happened
to you in Rook's lab.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.383
I'm not letting you out
until I find out what.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.962
[screeching]

38:18.964 --> 38:20.563
Drop the shield!

38:36.448 --> 38:38.515
And you have no idea
what's wrong with him?

38:38.517 --> 38:40.517
[TWO]
No, but the answers have to be

38:40.519 --> 38:42.052
back on that space station.

38:42.054 --> 38:45.021
I've had The Android set
a course. We're going back.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.690
Until then, I'm not
taking any chances.

38:46.692 --> 38:50.627
He's staying in this stasis pod
until we can figure it out.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.661
[SIX]
What the hell?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.496
He should be unconscious.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.433
Despite what it
looks like, he is.

38:56.435 --> 39:05.342
[screeching]

39:05.344 --> 39:07.077
[TWO] Help me move this
into the corridor.

39:07.079 --> 39:08.678
Let's go.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.015
I've completed my override
of the outer airlock door.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.283
Good.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.550
Four, Six, you're with me.

39:14.551 --> 39:15.817
Everyone else,
go behind the bulkhead.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.588
Whatever's inside of him's
trying to escape.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.457
When I open the pod,
you guys drag him clear.

39:20.459 --> 39:21.791
--Understood?
--[SIX] Yeah.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.560
[TWO]
Three, two...

39:24.730 --> 39:26.129
[TWO]
Go!

39:29.134 --> 39:33.837
[screeching]

39:33.839 --> 39:35.438
Space it!

39:38.877 --> 39:40.477
Okay.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.553
What the hell was on our ship?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.841
You look... okay.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.910
Yeah.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.879
So does that mean
you're gonna be fine?

40:15.881 --> 40:18.181
[TWO]
Yes.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.183
Great.

40:20.185 --> 40:21.885
We did it.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.052
Wait--

40:23.054 --> 40:25.722
What the hell
am I doing in here?

40:25.724 --> 40:27.624
What do you remember?

40:29.461 --> 40:31.528
Um...

40:32.764 --> 40:36.433
I remember going
to the space station.

40:36.435 --> 40:40.170
I remember Rook,
that bastard, killing Eric.

40:40.172 --> 40:43.807
I remember being
taken to the lab,

40:43.809 --> 40:45.975
being strapped down,
and then...

40:48.113 --> 40:49.712
...nothin'.

40:52.184 --> 40:55.051
His brain activity is normal.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.120
What?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.188
[THE ANDROID] It appears he's
back to his old self again.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.628
"Old self"?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.696
What happened to me?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.031
I don't know,
but I'll tell you

41:08.033 --> 41:10.600
what I do know,
later, over drinks.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.168
As uncharacteristic
as this sounds,

41:12.170 --> 41:14.537
screw the drinks;
I wanna know now.

41:14.539 --> 41:16.506
Trust me, you're gonna
want that drink.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.074
Trust you, seriously?

41:18.076 --> 41:19.776
If it wasn't for him,

41:19.777 --> 41:21.477
--you would--
--[THREE] Oh, come on.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.113
Did he save my life again?

41:27.786 --> 41:30.053
It's just getting
kinda old, isn't it?

41:30.055 --> 41:32.589
For you and me both.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.491
This experience has
reminded me of my own

41:34.493 --> 41:37.660
energy requirements.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.663
If anyone needs me, I'll be
on my charging platform.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.804
Good night.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.112
I think he's just doing it
on purpose now.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.116
Hey.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.522
What's going on
in that mind of yours?

42:05.524 --> 42:07.524
Rook.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.025
[THREE]
Oh, we'll get him next time.

42:10.262 --> 42:12.028
It's not revenge I want.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.730
It's answers.

42:13.732 --> 42:16.566
What the hell was going on
on that space station?

42:25.877 --> 42:29.879
[birds chirping]
