00:13.054 --> 00:14.347
- Sarah is just stronger
than me.

00:14.389 --> 00:17.434
- It's how you exploit
vulnerability that counts.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.478
- There's a panic button
in the Outpost.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.689
You press it,
and this calls me.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.859
- Ugh.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.327
- Stop!
Stop fighting now!

00:45.628 --> 00:48.548
- I am a vessel
filled with light.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.592
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.678
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.097
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.395
Getting warmer, Mom.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.316
Bigger chin?
Softer eyes?

01:06.358 --> 01:11.237
Yes? No? Maybe?

01:11.279 --> 01:14.407
I'll take that as a yes.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.638
- Carrie.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.060
- Carrie.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.649
both:
You're just rotting flesh.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.830
- Sooner.
It's still early.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.458
I am a vessel filled
with light.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.460
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.462
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.757
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.300
I am a vessel
filled with light.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.593
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.178
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.139
My sacrifice
is a symptom of--

02:19.180 --> 02:20.640
I am a vessel
filled with light.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.809
I am
a weapon against the shadow.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.561
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.105
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.274
I am a vessel
filled with light.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.775
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.610
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

03:15.320 --> 03:21.242
- You deserve care.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.287
You deserve sweet honey.

03:24.329 --> 03:28.416
I can make it all feel better.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.305
Calm mind.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.015
It's still early.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.622
Shh!

05:44.386 --> 05:47.931
I missed you.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.974
Stop.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.320
Shh!

06:02.362 --> 06:04.114
Sarah, they will kill us both.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.926
Do you have a bandage?

06:32.100 --> 06:34.436
You're stronger.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.896
Please.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.815
- You killed your own people.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.626
- Have you ever listened
to their music before?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.802
It's like listening
to a new color, isn't it?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.977
A friend taught this to me.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.729
- Why did you abandon
your post?

07:19.647 --> 07:22.567
- It's called slow dancing.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.611
Isn't it nice?

07:24.652 --> 07:27.989
- Why did you abandon us?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.242
- It should have been you
in here.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.828
- You're selfish.
- I know.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.122
- You're a coward.
- I know.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.917
- You disgust me.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.377
- I know.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.462
- I should rip your heart out
and throw it to the Herd.

07:48.009 --> 07:52.055
- But then I couldn't
make things right.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.468
- Mirrors.
Mirrors.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.450
- Alarm activated.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.806
- You can't move
if I can see you.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.896
- The Ledger isn't here.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.524
- Well, it was here
four days ago.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.235
- Your father had it removed
when I was installed.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.863
- That's against custom.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.198
Now how are you supposed
to identify threats?

10:57.240 --> 11:00.785
- He's council leader.
He invents custom.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.746
- He's a narcissist.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.998
- Generous view of your family.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.916
- Why did he take the book?
- I don't know.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.420
He doesn't have
to explain himself.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.255
How's that feel?

11:12.297 --> 11:14.924
- Yeah, better.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.763
The Ledger poisons
human souls.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.848
It can't leave Gehenna.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.725
- Well, it left Gehenna.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.977
Ask Hosea when Arthur
drags you back.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.438
That'll be a fun reunion.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.274
- Sarah, wait.

11:31.316 --> 11:36.654
I'm here, in the Butcher's Den,
doing the Guardians' work.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.163
Please.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.586
There was once a time where
you still had faith in me.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.843
- Carrie, I have full faith
in who you really are.

12:11.898 --> 12:16.528
- I will fill Arthur's shoes.
I promise.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.239
- Get out!

12:19.280 --> 12:22.409
- Just give me a chance.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.411
Call, and I will come.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.831
- I said, get out!

12:27.872 --> 12:32.002
- It was him or me, Sarah.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.346
- You want a redemption story?

12:43.388 --> 12:46.683
Turn yourself in to Hosea,
take his punishment,

12:46.725 --> 12:50.186
and let the Colony deal
with the tear in West Pine.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.900
I will never, as long
as I live, call for you.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.361
That's my promise.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.280
Out.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.027
- I heard stuff from
the south quadrant last night.

14:21.069 --> 14:25.448
I don't know if you saw that.
The further one fell.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.706
- The Ledger.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.858
"The Pestilent Stream."

15:41.900 --> 15:44.652
- Well, this is a surprise.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.033
So what's your plan then?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.747
- Why did you take the Ledger?

15:58.249 --> 16:01.378
- A certain someone
let the Herd out.

16:01.419 --> 16:05.757
We needed guidance.
What did you expect?

16:12.764 --> 16:16.267
- I'm returning it to Gehenna.
It'll poison you.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.771
- I think I've shown that
I can remain pretty impartial.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.439
- Some might say, "Cold."

16:25.360 --> 16:27.904
- Ever seen a fainting goat?

16:27.946 --> 16:30.156
It's a type of goat
that evolved

16:30.198 --> 16:34.536
so, when afraid,
it freezes and faints.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.623
It's a silly survival
mechanism, total failure.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.251
Always made me laugh as a boy.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.504
Sometimes I think
we're just like those goats

16:44.546 --> 16:46.965
but don't see it.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.051
A person might sacrifice

16:50.093 --> 16:55.265
thousands of lives in order
to save the one that they love.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.019
Our heart tells us
what feels right

16:59.060 --> 17:01.396
while blinding us to what is.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.939
- Good thing
you don't have a heart.

17:07.819 --> 17:12.699
- Very much, I do.

17:12.741 --> 17:18.121
I feel lonely at night...

17:20.540 --> 17:23.293
Nostalgic
for when you were a child.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.504
But I know this.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.008
I will always fight
for the thousands over the one.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.801
That's what makes
our colony special.

17:31.843 --> 17:34.637
- So that's how you justify
killing your daughter?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.933
- Why would I kill you?

17:38.975 --> 17:43.980
- To teach the others
not to make the mistakes I did.

17:44.022 --> 17:47.817
You sent Arthur
to drag me back.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.444
- Strangely enough,

17:49.486 --> 17:52.697
we found him dead in the woods

17:52.739 --> 17:56.242
for nothing, really.

17:56.284 --> 18:00.789
They've grown lazy, our town,

18:00.830 --> 18:04.209
but with the Bloodherd loose,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.212
they're starting to feel
the fire in their bellies.

18:07.253 --> 18:11.299
You see, their fear will
make them hungry for heroes.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.221
Arthur and the others
will be martyrs,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.683
and they will grow stronger.
I should thank you.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.143
- A new Door opened
because of me.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.062
I need the Ledger
to help me close it.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.023
- And I'm taking care of it.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.067
- I need to right my wrongs.

18:29.109 --> 18:32.445
- And once the new Door
is closed

18:32.487 --> 18:36.533
and we're all safe, what then?

18:36.574 --> 18:41.538
- I'll return.
It's what the Colony teaches.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.542
- Mm-hmm.

18:45.583 --> 18:49.838
Sure. Sure.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.548
Then warmth.

18:58.096 --> 19:00.390
When you were two years old,

19:00.432 --> 19:02.267
you found
an injured baby sparrow

19:02.308 --> 19:03.893
that had fallen from its nest,

19:03.935 --> 19:08.273
and you picked it up,
and you said, "My friend bird."

19:09.607 --> 19:13.278
You begged us to nurse it
back to health.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.447
Now, that was
so much grace from you.

19:18.450 --> 19:22.120
That's the fountain
I drink from, that grace.

19:24.706 --> 19:28.585
But think about the thousands
out there who depend on us

19:28.626 --> 19:31.504
for protection.
Don't they deserve grace too?

19:31.546 --> 19:32.881
- Stop.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.343
- The disciples who died

19:36.384 --> 19:37.969
to service your abandonment,

19:38.011 --> 19:41.097
don't they deserve grace?

19:41.139 --> 19:44.351
Arthur,

19:44.392 --> 19:50.690
who loved you, who you killed,
where is his grace?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.942
- I'm sorry.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.111
- Shh.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.946
Shh, shh, shh.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.282
It's okay.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.660
No, it's okay.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.954
Here.

20:04.996 --> 20:11.127
The others will be so happy
to hear that you're safe.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.420
Let's get you

20:12.462 --> 20:15.632
into some council-sanctioned
clothes,

20:15.674 --> 20:21.096
and I will bring you
a nice fresh meal,

20:21.137 --> 20:23.765
and then you can go.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.705
She's inside. Command.
- Mm-hmm.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.477
- Get her.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.408
- She escaped.

21:43.386 --> 21:50.226
- Tasha?

21:50.268 --> 21:52.771
Tasha?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.564
- Carrie?
Is that you?

21:58.360 --> 22:00.904
- You shared me with the world,
Tasha, against my wishes.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.655
- Get back here!
- You betrayed me.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.909
You said you would hide me.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.410
- It's touching
my neck, Carrie!

22:07.452 --> 22:08.620
- Wait, what?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.205
- If I blink, I die.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.665
You have to trust me now.
Carrie?

22:12.707 --> 22:15.543
- I do.
Of course, I do, Tasha.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.962
- Okay, then.
Take your blade out.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.589
- Okay, it's out.

22:19.631 --> 22:23.134
- Walk towards me but stop like
two feet away. Not too close.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.095
- Like here?
- Good.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.388
Stab, on three.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.515
- Wait, what?
- One, two--

22:28.556 --> 22:30.058
- Stab what?

22:30.100 --> 22:31.184
- Stab! I said, stab!

22:34.938 --> 22:36.189
- Are you okay?

22:36.231 --> 22:38.358
- Yeah.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.446
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

22:51.496 --> 22:53.456
Holy shit!

22:56.334 --> 22:57.836
both: Holy shit.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.965
- Carrie, I'm sorry
I made you trend on TikTok.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.466
- Tasha--
- I just wanted the world

23:03.508 --> 23:05.051
to see what a fun, cool fella
you are.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.386
- Tasha.
- What?

23:06.428 --> 23:07.679
- Look.

23:28.450 --> 23:31.119
They're human.
