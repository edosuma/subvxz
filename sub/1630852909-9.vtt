00:06.000 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.400 --> 00:15.440
Excuse me, Antonio. Thank you.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.360
Thanks, Charlie.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.080
Hello. Good evening, everyone.
How are you?

00:22.160 --> 00:25.160
I imagine that those
who waited and trained for this moment

00:25.240 --> 00:27.640
must be very anxious. So are we.

00:27.720 --> 00:32.480
Tomorrow's edition will be
the 15th Cielo Grande Summer Crush.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.560
All right!

00:35.480 --> 00:38.800
-Where could they be?
-I called a million times and no answer.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.240
How bad is the fire, Noda?

00:46.320 --> 00:49.600
I don't know. Augusto was worried,
but I didn't ask him that.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.000
I don't have a single bar.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.880
On this stretch,
it's impossible to communicate.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.240
As you know, our competitors
have been training on two rivers

01:02.320 --> 01:05.000
without knowing exactly
which one they'd compete on.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.680
And now it's time
to unveil the unknown. Charlie.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.360
The Summer Crush will be

01:13.440 --> 01:14.920
on the Correntoso.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.200
All right, Augusto!

01:18.280 --> 01:21.480
Now it's up to you guys.
I wish you a lot of luck.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.800
Here. For the competition.
It's my lucky amulet.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.440
Thanks. How sweet.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.600
What's up, Steffi? Where did you go?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.560
I've been looking for you all over.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.120
Steffi?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.680
Hello?

02:04.080 --> 02:05.000
Everything okay?

02:05.080 --> 02:08.840
I couldn't hear her well.
She mentioned something about a fire here.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.400
We're almost there.
It's there. Relax, girls.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.560
-I don't see anything.
-I don't see it.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.280
-I don't see smoke either.
-Get your things.

02:18.360 --> 02:19.480
I don't see any smoke.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.440
Get off quick.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.960
-I'll help you.
-Easy.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.760
Red alert.
Steffi, Luz, and her mother just arrived.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.000
-Do you see something?
-Nothing.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.120
-I don't smell anything.
-Me neither.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.480
-Noda, where did they say it was?
-Sorry. There's no fire.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.360
-What do you mean?
-I had to bring you back.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.640
Why did you do this?

02:39.720 --> 02:41.600
-Because I asked him to.
-Ron?

02:44.320 --> 02:45.600
Noda, some privacy.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.520
I didn't want Steffi
to be let down by you.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.080
-That doesn't make sense, Dad.
-Your daughter?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.720
Yeah, you heard right.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.120
This liar is my dad.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.080
And it seems like he's mine too.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.640
How am I your father?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.520
Then I'm Steffi's mom.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.120
-What?
-What?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.720
Lyn Ordóñez is my mom.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.240
Dad?

03:21.440 --> 03:23.280
You're twins.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.040
He's your dad, and I'm your mom.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.240
What are you talking about?
I never knew this.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.960
That's impossible.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.000
Steffi.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.440
I didn't want to hurt you.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.280
I didn't want you looking
for a mom who didn't love you.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.320
Yes, I did love her, and I do love her.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.840
Your parents convinced me
that separating them was best.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.840
Best?

03:47.680 --> 03:51.840
How can hiding a sister and a mom
from someone be what's best?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.600
My parents separated them?

03:59.680 --> 04:00.840
My grandparents?

04:01.360 --> 04:04.400
They said you didn't want the baby,
not that there were two.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.640
They told me you didn't want to know
about your daughters or me at all.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.240
My grandparents made all that up?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.240
I can't believe that all these years

04:21.720 --> 04:22.920
I had a mom.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.480
And they made me believe she was dead?

04:28.880 --> 04:30.800
And you went along with the lie?

04:34.720 --> 04:36.800
And you hid from me that I had a sister.

04:40.760 --> 04:41.960
No, don't touch me.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.720
-Safety?
-Paramedics and ambulance confirmed.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.880
Is the podium set up?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.800
We're missing some boxes,

05:08.880 --> 05:11.360
and the tent for the riders
arrives in an hour.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.120
Have the judges been selected?

05:13.200 --> 05:16.280
Augusto was on that,
and he said everything was okay.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
Hey.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.040
Nati.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.200
Nati, Julián and I were thinking
maybe you could help us

05:34.280 --> 05:37.480
with ushering people
during the competition. What do you think?

05:37.560 --> 05:41.040
Yeah, whatever you want.
We always do whatever you want.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.280
You're right, Nati.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.120
Sorry, I was mean. But look.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.920
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:53.160
<i>Friend zone</i>

05:55.440 --> 05:56.880
<i>Friend zone</i>

05:56.960 --> 05:59.440
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no…</i>

05:59.520 --> 06:02.480
-You put butterflies in.
-Yeah, Nati.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.000
Sorry for being so obtuse.

06:05.080 --> 06:09.440
I promise I'll try
to be more astute, acute. I don't know.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.480
As long as you're a triangle
and not a square, you're fine.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.480
-So should we post the video?
-Yes.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.600
-I'm joining in too.
-Let's do it.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.160
-On three.
-All right.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.600
Three, two, one…

06:22.640 --> 06:24.000
-All right!
-Yeah!

06:24.720 --> 06:25.760
Great team.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.120
Do you have a minute?
I'd like to talk to you.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.480
I never thought we'd see each other again.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.400
And even less that you'd want to talk
after disappearing all those years ago.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.640
I think we should face our past.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.200
I'm not gonna talk to someone
who's literally lied to me my whole life.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.680
Ron didn't know the truth either.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.840
They lied to him too.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.400
But that's no excuse.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.560
He chose to lie to me.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.000
This woman is supposed to be my mom.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.760
I have the picture
of some unknown woman on my screen.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.240
And since I got here, I've been into this.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.600
Lie after lie

07:27.360 --> 07:28.280
after lie.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.680
Enough. Let's concentrate
on the competition, all right?

07:35.760 --> 07:36.720
Yeah.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.280
Let's put our energy into the competition,
which will do us some good.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.000
-Good day.
-Good day.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.200
I hope your night
wasn't as stormy as ours.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.800
What? Nervous about the competition?

07:50.880 --> 07:51.920
Not exactly.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.400
I am about our family.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.360
Ron?

08:02.240 --> 08:03.800
Luz and I are sisters.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.000
It's a long story. I don't want us
distracted from the competition.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.680
We'll talk later.

08:14.120 --> 08:19.200
Steffi, I'm Natasha. Do you remember me,
or is your memory not totally back?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.880
I wish, but unfortunately,
you're like a cockroach.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.360
You survive anything.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.240
I'm glad your sense of humor is back.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.360
Today is gonna be a relaxing day for me.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.040
I'll probably be bored.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.320
I thought
I could take Julián out for a walk.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.880
Surely he must be really bored,
and you're so busy training.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.280
Steffi running away from me. Weird.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.040
Does she do that with everyone or just me?

08:50.080 --> 08:50.920
What did you do?

08:51.800 --> 08:56.520
They say the vitamins in fruit
are great for perfect skin.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.000
I'll see you on the Correntoso, Natasha.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.640
I've always loved you.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.360
I left 'cause I thought you hated me.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.400
Another of my parents' lies.
I should've looked for you.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.800
-Why didn't you?
-I didn't have the courage.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.440
I really thought
you didn't love our daughter or me.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.600
I never imagined
there being another child. All this time…

09:20.680 --> 09:25.320
I understand my parents lied,
but why didn't you ever tell me about Luz?

09:25.400 --> 09:28.720
-You were also in on this.
-What could I have done?

09:28.800 --> 09:32.400
They said you were an immature womanizer
and couldn't handle two girls,

09:32.480 --> 09:35.720
and if they handled it,
they'd be better off.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.640
I really did what I could, Ron.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.400
It's not true. I'm not a womanizer.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.960
But I am immature
to have let my parents handle everything.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.400
The boxes are for the podium.
They go over there, okay? Thanks.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.400
Well, one, two over there.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.000
What do I need to do?

09:55.600 --> 09:59.000
-Nati, you bring the scoreboard.
-Okay.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.000
And also the wooden boxes
are for the podium.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.960
When we get there,
make sure first place is in the middle,

10:05.040 --> 10:07.160
third to the left,
and second on the right.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.280
-So third goes in the middle--
-No, Nati.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.880
Don't worry, Charlie.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
I'm really good at math.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.840
What's the connection?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.640
-Hi. What's up?
-Hi.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.880
We're going to the Correntoso.
We gotta take advantage of the last day.

10:23.960 --> 10:24.920
Okay.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
Have a nice time.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.360
-I'll look for the others.
-Okay, perfect.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.640
Julián, today is my free day.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.520
What if we took a walk around to relax?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.960
Look, Natasha. Honestly,
I'm crazy busy organizing all this.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.720
Today and tomorrow are gonna be
full of work. Sorry.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.920
Well, next time.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.840
I wouldn't go
even if I had 10,000 days off.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.680
You put her in the nothing zone, buddy.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.240
Let's go. Come on.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.560
So you're twins

11:12.640 --> 11:14.120
but not identical twins.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.440
I never would've guessed.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.520
<i>Day by day, I look for</i>

11:28.600 --> 11:31.360
<i>Your gaze in mine</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:34.680
<i>That yesterday I saw you</i>

11:34.760 --> 11:37.560
<i>And I felt you a thousand steps away</i>

11:37.640 --> 11:40.880
<i>You are by my side</i>

11:40.960 --> 11:44.040
<i>But after a while you are leaving</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:46.840
<i>This image that I do not forget</i>

11:46.920 --> 11:51.560
<i>And insists that I return</i>

11:52.520 --> 11:55.680
<i>I find myself a thousand steps away</i>

11:55.760 --> 11:58.840
<i>I can't help it</i>

11:58.920 --> 12:02.080
<i>It will be fear, I go back to zero</i>

12:02.160 --> 12:07.560
<i>And I walk away trying</i>

12:08.080 --> 12:09.400
All right!

12:10.440 --> 12:11.360
Really good!

12:11.880 --> 12:13.720
<i>-Verdade ou consequência?</i>
-What?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.320
Truth or dare? You have to pick one.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.800
-That's for kids.
-I know.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.480
But if you were playing,
what would you pick?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.040
Truth.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.160
-Okay.
-No, dare.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.840
-Okay.
-No, truth.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.960
-Nati.
-Sorry. Truth.

12:29.560 --> 12:30.520
-Truth?
-Truth.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.720
Who were you thinking of
when you wrote the song?

12:36.360 --> 12:37.800
You already know who.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.240
And you? Who were you thinking
of when you heard it?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.360
Seems like you already know too.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.600
You know who I was thinking of,
yet no one asked me.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.480
Poor you.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.160
We should prepare two possible runs,
depending on the order you come out.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.360
Yeah, the selection is this afternoon.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.720
We could prepare a run
for if you go out before Natasha

13:01.800 --> 13:04.920
and another in case you go after,
based on her score.

13:06.400 --> 13:11.040
I was thinking at the end of the run,
there should be a more complicated trick.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.560
What about the 720?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.280
It seems really risky.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.200
You should try it
only if Natasha has a perfect run.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.520
We could do it now.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.680
The conditions are good,
and there's no danger for the landing.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.120
-Watch out for the log, Steffi!
-Watch out, Steffi!

13:37.000 --> 13:37.920
What do you think?

13:41.560 --> 13:42.720
Are you all right?

13:43.600 --> 13:44.440
Yeah.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.640
Look.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.920
Let's not force things. What's important
is that you've visualized your run.

13:53.000 --> 13:53.880
We can go.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.280
Let's go, Pedro.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.120
See you. I'm gonna rest right now.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.160
So?

14:14.240 --> 14:17.320
Are you ready for the competition?
How was training?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.560
The truth is being there gave me chills.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.960
-Nerves?
-Yeah, but not like the other times.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.680
It was like my body remembered the fall.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.360
Talking about it,
I feel a knot in my stomach.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.600
-I think I know how to help you.
-How?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.280
Let me talk to Tony first.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.680
-Good day.
-Good day.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.280
If you'd told me,
I'd have given you a better room.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.400
It's just that Cielo Grande was on fire.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.120
That boy, Noda,
told us there was a fire here.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.120
A fire? No, not at all.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.360
Who is he?

14:54.440 --> 14:56.320
His uncle asked me to give him a job.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.520
Noda thinks we've hired him,
but his uncle pays his salary.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.440
The weirdest part is that Ron Navarro
ordered him to make all this up.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.400
Ron Navarro, the wakeboarder?

15:05.480 --> 15:07.160
Yeah, the one who's staying here.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.200
Ron Lavalle is Ron Navarro.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.320
Of course. I knew
I knew him from somewhere.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.560
Are you all right?

15:20.880 --> 15:24.320
Yeah. It's just this debt issue
has really gotten to me.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.600
The loan?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.800
First payment's due this week.
We don't have it.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.960
We've achieved a lot thanks to Luz.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.040
She made it all happen.
You should be proud of your daughter.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.040
It's just that Luz…

15:41.640 --> 15:42.560
Luz is Luz.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.320
Why the mystery?
Do you know anything about this?

15:49.400 --> 15:51.920
I know nothing.
I'm just as intrigued as you are.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.840
I know nothing.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.920
-Hi. What's up?
-Hi.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Where are you two gonna take us?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.520
You need to focus, don't you?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.640
Honestly, it would be nice
if nothing bad came my way.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.720
We're gonna spend the night
camping on the side of the river.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.960
Yeah, Julián and I checked it out,

16:09.040 --> 16:11.280
and we thought it'd be a good plan.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.360
All right. Shall we?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.920
-Let's go.
-Let's do it.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.360
There are so many positive comments.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.040
I still found a couple
that didn't get the sharks.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.760
Several don't get the butterflies.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.280
But most are positive.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.280
The key was getting the twins
to mention it on their accounts.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.400
Great job, guys. How are we
with "Save Cielo"? Do we need anything?

16:59.480 --> 17:00.520
No, almost nothing.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.160
This is the sponsorship page.
It's almost finished.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.720
Tomorrow we'll publish it.

17:04.800 --> 17:09.480
This says how much money we've raised.
It gives you the option to contribute

17:09.560 --> 17:13.160
and also explains what we need
the money for. Absolutely everything.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
I'm anxious.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.120
And I am even more.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.040
There's a lot at stake.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.800
Let me know if you need anything.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.280
-All right.
-Okay, perfect. Let's go.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.200
Ron!

17:27.160 --> 17:28.440
Navarro or Lavalle?

17:29.520 --> 17:32.720
Lavalle from my mother
and Navarro from my father.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.720
What is this place?

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
Another one of my hideouts.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.480
And now that we're here,

17:52.160 --> 17:53.280
what's the plan?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.480
I brought you here to this special place

17:55.560 --> 17:59.720
because I think it's the connection
Steffi needs to give it her all tomorrow.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.520
So this is what you were planning.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.640
Hear that?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.080
That's the sound of nature.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.040
The idea is to push out any thoughts
and leave your mind blank.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.880
Now let's close our eyes.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.080
And we're gonna take three deep breaths.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.520
Concentrate on the air
that enters through your nose

18:36.200 --> 18:37.880
and leaves through your nose.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.560
Let go of all thoughts.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.320
What are you thinking about?

18:59.160 --> 19:00.600
The accident again.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.000
Every time I close my eyes,

19:05.040 --> 19:08.320
I feel all the sensations
from that moment coming back.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.320
I can't avoid it.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.160
Yes, you can.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.720
Concentrate on your breathing

19:17.440 --> 19:18.280
and my voice.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
Close your eyes.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.560
Let it go easily.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.720
Let all those thoughts pass.

19:34.960 --> 19:39.200
Don't try to hold them or block them,
but let them go.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.040
Get them and let them go.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.440
Like the air.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.280
That's it.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.480
We've decided the order
the participants will go in.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.200
All right!

20:02.840 --> 20:04.280
-Good.
-Bravo.

20:04.360 --> 20:09.360
Male participants. Rovegno,
Bessi, Scandalori, Blasi, Ferreiro.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.000
All right!

20:11.080 --> 20:15.640
Female participants.
Lambert, Velayos, Rossi, and Navarro.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.440
All right!

20:18.000 --> 20:20.040
That's all. Tomorrow's the big day.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.280
Have a relaxing and peaceful night.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.800
The competition awaits.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.360
And after the competition,
get your vocal cords ready

20:28.440 --> 20:30.400
because there's a party at Sky Vibes.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.560
All right!

20:34.280 --> 20:36.280
Where the hell is Steffi?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.920
Maybe tomorrow
she won't show up for the competition.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.160
And now,

20:53.680 --> 20:55.080
when you feel ready,

20:55.800 --> 20:58.160
you're gonna imagine
your run on the Correntoso,

20:58.240 --> 21:00.680
but this time it's gonna come out perfect.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.480
You're gonna imagine every movement,

21:06.360 --> 21:07.800
every drop of water.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.720
It's a peaceful, sunny day.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.200
Concentrate on how you feel being there,

21:15.800 --> 21:17.000
on your breathing.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.360
And now,

21:20.320 --> 21:21.400
start the run.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.640
You're doing all the tricks perfectly.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.200
That's it.

21:29.720 --> 21:30.560
Perfect.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.200
And finally,

21:34.600 --> 21:37.840
you've finished your run without falling.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.000
You did it.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.440
And?

21:49.040 --> 21:50.000
How do you feel?

21:50.720 --> 21:51.840
Better than ever.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.480
Thanks, Julián.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.720
That was just what I needed.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.800
I have to admit, at first,
I didn't think this would work.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.800
Every time I tried to clear my mind,

22:05.400 --> 22:07.320
more thoughts would come into my head.

22:08.400 --> 22:13.520
But now I was able to let go
of the anger I feel for my dad.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.480
That makes me really happy.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.480
Try to do this
when you're at the starting line.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.120
And you, Luz? How are you?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.520
Good.

22:30.720 --> 22:35.680
I'm still a little shook by everything
and a little worried for Charlie and Nati,

22:35.760 --> 22:38.600
since we left them alone
with "Save Cielo."

22:38.680 --> 22:41.040
No, don't worry about that.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.440
They're putting together something great.

22:43.520 --> 22:44.720
You'll see tomorrow.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.000
Plus, it's good to delegate sometimes.
You've been doing a lot.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.680
Well,

22:53.400 --> 22:57.040
I don't know about you,
but all this meditation's made me hungry.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.760
-Should we make dinner?
-All right. I'll help you.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
Am I interrupting?

23:12.600 --> 23:15.960
No, not at all. I was contemplating
the secrets of the universe.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.480
You got married.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.120
Yeah.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.360
I got married and widowed.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.480
How sad. I didn't know, Ron.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.280
Paula, Ian's mom,

23:29.880 --> 23:31.840
was really important to Steffi.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.720
She motivated her
to come here and find the truth.

23:37.120 --> 23:41.360
When I found out about Luz,
I thought you'd had her after we met.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.800
I never imagined she could be my daughter.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.760
I can't believe this is happening.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.280
<i>Now</i>

24:07.360 --> 24:08.840
<i>It's now</i>

24:08.920 --> 24:10.160
<i>I'm here now</i>

24:10.240 --> 24:11.960
<i>I'm going now</i>

24:12.040 --> 24:14.960
<i>I want to be, to take risks</i>

24:18.280 --> 24:21.400
<i>Trying is the only way</i>

24:21.480 --> 24:24.040
<i>And who knows? I could be wrong</i>

24:24.640 --> 24:27.800
<i>Together we're much more</i>

24:29.320 --> 24:32.280
<i>It's true</i>

24:32.360 --> 24:35.400
<i>I don't know if it will work</i>

24:35.480 --> 24:38.280
<i>And it's true</i>

24:38.880 --> 24:41.320
<i>We'll have to try</i>

24:41.840 --> 24:43.120
<i>Now</i>

24:43.200 --> 24:44.680
<i>It's now</i>

24:44.760 --> 24:45.600
<i>I'm here now</i>

24:45.680 --> 24:47.840
<i>I'm going now</i>

24:47.920 --> 24:51.960
<i>I know that with your help I'll make it</i>

24:53.880 --> 24:57.160
<i>It's not about winning, not about losing</i>

24:57.240 --> 25:00.360
<i>We have to try</i>

25:00.440 --> 25:01.920
<i>It's now</i>

25:02.720 --> 25:06.800
<i>Taking risks, hugging friendship</i>

25:06.880 --> 25:09.640
<i>There's no other than to try</i>

25:09.720 --> 25:12.600
<i>And I don't know, I could fall</i>

25:12.680 --> 25:19.040
<i>Together we're much more</i>

25:27.840 --> 25:31.800
I never imagined when I got here
all this would be waiting for me.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.400
Not you.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.360
And not me either.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.920
You don't even remember.
You were unbearable when we got here.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.600
I got over that pretty quickly though.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.200
Let's go.

26:03.080 --> 26:03.920
You know what?

26:08.000 --> 26:12.200
I think deep down
I always knew we were connected.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.240
It also makes sense

26:15.320 --> 26:18.040
that you met here at Cielo Grande,

26:18.720 --> 26:19.560
doesn't it?

26:44.240 --> 26:45.960
The moon looks so beautiful here.

26:48.120 --> 26:52.440
This the most special place in the delta.
Sometimes I come and spend the night here.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.480
I've never shown it to anyone.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.600
It was my secret.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.920
Thanks for everything you've done for me.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.200
Your meditations
have really helped me a lot.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.160
You know how to get the best out of me.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.560
My pleasure.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.480
Now I feel more ready than ever
for the competition.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.880
And it's all thanks to you.
