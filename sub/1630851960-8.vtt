[theme music plays]

00:53.261 --> 00:54.137
[exhales]

00:54.220 --> 00:57.140
[in Spanish] Oh, I pray to God
you're done, pig.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.309
JLo has the same cup.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.854
I love how it shines so pretty,
just like me!

01:02.937 --> 01:06.483
[speaking Mandarin]

01:06.775 --> 01:09.861
You're only pretty because your boyfriend
bought you new teeth.

01:09.944 --> 01:13.323
No, he only paid for one crown.
That's why he's my ex-novio.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.534
You need to love yourselves,
like I love myself.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.036
[in Spanish] Jealous bitches.

01:18.453 --> 01:22.332
You don't know how
to enjoy life. All you do is work.

01:22.916 --> 01:27.087
[in Spanish] Mari, you know what?
I'm the fucking queen of Los Angeles.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.506
When I get home,
my throne's ready

01:30.006 --> 01:32.342
with my face masks and my slippers.

01:32.759 --> 01:37.806
You know what, Mari?
I don't have time for #metime.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.224
And you know what?
I don't care.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.309
I care about “me time” too.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.230
So for me, I’ll let you
take this extra work home.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.192
I'm gonna need them by tomorrow morning.
No excuses.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.200
No excuses and no overtime, baboso.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.786
[bell chimes]

02:00.078 --> 02:02.080
[unintelligible chatter]

02:04.916 --> 02:05.917
You see?

02:07.168 --> 02:09.671
-We need to go to the union meeting.
-Shh!

02:11.047 --> 02:12.465
I'm exhausted.

02:12.757 --> 02:14.968
Too much work without any breaks.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.096
My back hurts,
thanks to these shitty chairs.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.098
Aye, my back hurts too.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.183
But for different reasons.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.226
[sound of disgust]

02:23.309 --> 02:26.479
I have heard about these
fake organizing meetings

02:26.646 --> 02:29.607
to see who they go.
And then they fire the people that go.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.442
I heard that at the bus stop.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.862
The bus chismes, all lies.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.947
They said that Juanga was still alive.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.907
I'm going to the meeting.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.661
-They give free stuff!
-I'm not gonna lose my job over bullshit.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.579
I'm not going.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.622
[slurps]

02:44.706 --> 02:45.665
[under breath] Whatever.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.296
Oh, please, Beatriz.
They will never fire you.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.882
[speaking Mandarin]

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
You're the best patternmaker here.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.401
[Yessica] Why?

03:13.735 --> 03:16.654
Why does he have to put arugula
on my carnitas?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.908
I actually kinda like it. But, I mean,
if you're not into free food...

03:19.991 --> 03:20.909
Bitch, please.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.244
-I'll never be above free food.
-[laughs]

03:23.328 --> 03:25.705
No wonder your ass
is always hanging out at food drives.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.790
[unintelligible chatter in Spanish]

03:28.583 --> 03:29.959
Uh-oh. [sighs]

03:30.793 --> 03:32.754
What is it? What'd I do now?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.339
I get hot sauce in your eyes?

03:34.422 --> 03:35.965
-Nothing.
-[text notification sound]

03:36.049 --> 03:38.384
Just actually really sad
about the arugula.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.762
Okay, stop it. I know you.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.014
I’m just a little stressed, that's all.

03:44.515 --> 03:48.228
Girl, I got you. What you need is a hit.

03:48.978 --> 03:49.812
[Exhales]

03:50.647 --> 03:52.815
-No. No, my love.
-No?

03:54.150 --> 03:55.151
I'm just...

03:56.861 --> 03:58.154
I'm feeling guilty.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.824
Like I'm out here enjoying the day

04:01.908 --> 04:05.411
when there's a long list of people
waiting for a miracle.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.624
And that means you don't deserve a break?

04:11.668 --> 04:15.129
Babe, self-care is the best care.
I'm pretty sure you taught me that.

04:15.213 --> 04:19.634
And, yeah. Okay, we can't all be
Cesar Chavez, but we're doing our best.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.761
[cell phone rings]

04:26.015 --> 04:28.017
-That's okay. You can answer.
-Nope.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.520
I'm here for you.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.272
What'd you need help with?

04:33.314 --> 04:35.566
Remember that homeless count
I told you about?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.485
Well, there's lots to do.

04:37.568 --> 04:40.321
-I gotta do the kits, the volunteers--
-Okay, great!

04:40.905 --> 04:42.407
Let's get this shit together.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.450
I got you.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.953
-Yeah?
-Well, yeah.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.706
Let's Cesar Chavez the fuck out of it!
[kisses]

04:50.290 --> 04:51.416
[both laugh]

05:02.427 --> 05:03.886
-Amá!
-[exhales]

05:05.138 --> 05:07.765
Mommy, can you help me
with my multiplication tables?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.560
-[in Spanish] Your sister can help you.
-Oh, not tonight. I got plans.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.979
[in Spanish] Oh, yeah?
Do you have plans to help your mother

05:13.062 --> 05:14.897
with the work that puts food on the table?

05:15.690 --> 05:19.068
Amá, don't worry.
I can get loose threads better than Ana.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.612
Small hands, remember? #chingona.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.614
Don't brag about child labor, Nayeli.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.035
[in Spanish] Well, here.
Imagine this is your art and help.

05:27.285 --> 05:31.164
Okay, don't be mad. I promised Yessika
that I'd help her prep the homeless count.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.333
And Nayeli, you got this!
I mean, you can do it!

05:33.416 --> 05:34.834
Two plus two equals four, baby girl.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.628
[in Spanish] Well, when you're counting
the homeless,

05:37.712 --> 05:41.132
remember to add us to the count,
because if I don't meet my quota,

05:41.215 --> 05:42.592
we'll end up on the streets.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.093
Aye, Amá, I always help you.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.637
Look, I just have to be there for Yessi
these next few days.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.555
[faucet running]

05:47.638 --> 05:50.516
[in Spanish] You always go out.
Here, there.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.144
And you leave me alone with Nayeli.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.521
When in reality,
I need you to be here.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.399
That's not true, Amá. I'm working hard!

05:58.483 --> 06:01.027
And all the work I do on the murals
is for all of us,

06:01.110 --> 06:02.737
so that you don't have to do this anymore.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.696
[dishes clink in sink]

06:03.780 --> 06:06.449
It's not right, Amá. I don't like it.
I don't like how they treat you.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.451
[in Spanish] Ha. And who does, hm?

06:09.452 --> 06:13.122
Okay, look. I'm really sorry,
but I just can't help this time.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.793
I heard Mari's mom said
that Juan Gabriel is still alive.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.337
-[in Spanish] Bye. I'm leaving!
-[in Spanish] Of course.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.468
Who washed the dishes?

06:25.551 --> 06:28.888
Not Ana. Guess it was Dishwasher Ghost
named Nayeli.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.225
[in Spanish] Oh, what a funny girl.
I don't need another jokester.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.231
[in Spanish] Are you dancing or working?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.734
-You need to go pee, don't you?
-Yeah.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.652
Me too.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.282
[whispers] Let's go.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.200
No.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.166
[chuckles] Whoa!

07:38.666 --> 07:40.543
Break's in two hours. Back to work.

07:40.918 --> 07:42.545
-But why?
-It's not worth it.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.882
Look, if I let you go, then everyone's
gonna wanna go whenever they want!

07:46.257 --> 07:48.509
I'm not going to discuss this.
Go back to work!

07:50.136 --> 07:51.512
[in Spanish] Let's go, Gloria.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.183
Whether now or later, it's the same.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.393
How does it affect anything?

07:57.602 --> 08:00.271
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go to your house

08:00.396 --> 08:03.441
where you can shit and piss
in your own bathroom whenever you want?

08:06.903 --> 08:07.737
Leave.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.991
You're fired.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.250
[in Spanish] And you?

08:21.626 --> 08:24.462
No. I like these bathrooms better.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.589
I'll wait for my break.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.387
We shouldn't have to raise our hand
to pee.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.014
[sobs]

08:35.431 --> 08:39.060
Maybe I'll invite him to wipe my ass
next time I take a dump.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.604
[sobs]

08:45.983 --> 08:47.985
[Bachata music plays from device]

08:49.946 --> 08:51.072
[in Spanish] Thank you.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.621
-[in Spanish] Old lady.
-[snickers]

08:58.704 --> 08:59.956
Let me get my beer.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.124
I got something else for you...

09:02.708 --> 09:04.877
if you keep looking as fine as you do.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.087
[in Spanish] Careful.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.838
Don't trick me
into giving you a fifth baby.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.298
Ew, uh-uh.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.925
[in Spanish] Don't be rude, Dad.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.427
I already fell for your brujería
with the first four.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.137
[in Spanish] Hey, give me another one.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.515
-[Mrs. Castillo chuckles]
-Y'all are really cute.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.684
Huh? Not as cute as us, though.

09:19.976 --> 09:20.810
[chuckles]

09:20.977 --> 09:22.603
[kisses] Hey, I'm happy you're here.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.774
[in Spanish] Hey, how's Pop?

09:27.316 --> 09:30.111
Chuey's driving Pop's truck para Uber.
[in Spanish] What happened?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.739
Uh, you know, they just got
some sort of arrangement.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.491
But it's all good.

09:35.950 --> 09:39.203
And Erik and Chris are actually,
like, hyping up the shop.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.914
You know, they have like Bite Heights,
or whatever.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.375
[in Spanish] Tell me when.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.295
[in Spanish] J, it's not
the white folks' fault

09:47.378 --> 09:49.630
they like Mama Fina's Barbacoa.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.383
I drive to Inglewood
for Little Kingston's curry goat.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.468
How very capitalist of you, Papi.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.053
Mm. [exhales]

09:56.137 --> 09:57.013
[in Spanish] Careful.

[cell phone rings]

09:58.681 --> 09:59.515
[sighs]

10:00.725 --> 10:02.018
[in Spanish] Hey, Amá. What’s up?

10:02.101 --> 10:04.937
[in Spanish] I need you to pick up Nayeli
after school.

10:05.479 --> 10:09.317
[sighs] It's your turn to pick her up.
I'm helping Yessika, remember?

10:09.400 --> 10:13.613
[sighs, in Spanish] Ana, I need your help,
okay? Just do it, please.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.409
It's okay. If you have to go, go.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.495
No.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.956
You know what, I'mma stay.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.835
I'll just... I'll call Chris.
He can pick her up. It's no problem.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.546
I'm here for you.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.011
[funk music plays]

10:39.347 --> 10:41.682
-Cool if you hang out here, homegirl?
-Yeah.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.560
But don't call me homegirl.
We're not there yet.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.062
Oh, let me know when you are.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.813
[in Spanish] Hey, cutie!

10:48.689 --> 10:49.523
[kisses]

10:49.607 --> 10:53.110
You know what? Dinner rush is
gonna hit soon. Let's go to the kitchen.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.570
-Okay, Pop.
-[in Spanish] Come on.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.868
Has anyone talked to Rob?
No? He's not answering my calls.

11:01.285 --> 11:04.038
Watermelon radish smoked brisket.

11:04.288 --> 11:08.167
-My mouth and my eyes already love it.
-All you're doing is listing ingredients.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.379
Like, the Big Mac was just a burger
until they hyped it with “Big” and “Mac.”

11:11.462 --> 11:14.173
What do you wanna do about it, Erik?
You wanna call it the Big McTaco?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.343
Does the watermelon radish
even taste like watermelon?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.720
You're just making a taco of McLies.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.642
Rob, this is Casimiro.
Call me back... por favor.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.479
You said you would have
the new lease for us by now.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.856
When are you coming? Tell me!

11:31.482 --> 11:33.150
Ay, Nayeli! You're in the way, girl.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.151
-Look.
-[food sizzles]

11:34.235 --> 11:37.196
Take my phone, go to the back,
and go play Candy Crush.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.907
Hey, don't roll your eyes at me.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.220
Hey, escuincla. What you up to?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.471
Homework.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.516
Mm. You hungry?
I can make you a huge burrito.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.601
I may even add a chile relleno for you.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.312
-How far is Bakersfield?
-Bakersfield?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.231
Woo! [exhales]

12:12.314 --> 12:15.776
Like, two hours?
What you know about Bakersfield?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.945
-Well, Danny lives there.
-Oh.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.280
So does Dolores Huerta.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.991
She's the one who came up
with the... [in Spanish]  "Yes, we can!"

12:22.408 --> 12:25.494
Yet, they can’t correct the history books.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.706
He says they have rows and rows
of fruit trees.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.249
I wanna go pick some one day.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.753
I don't think they're gonna have a problem
with the brown girl picking fruit.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.254
[scoffs]

12:35.629 --> 12:36.505
[hisses]

12:36.589 --> 12:37.798
Bakersfield.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.259
That's an interesting town.

12:41.552 --> 12:46.432
I once met a strong woman there
who gave me a weekend I'll never forget.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.349
[laughs]

12:47.475 --> 12:48.392
What's her name?

12:49.810 --> 12:50.853
I can't remember.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.938
But the bus ride was worth it.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.483
One big-ass burrito coming right up.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.123
[in Spanish] You deserve more.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.502
When they don't pay you overtime,

13:14.585 --> 13:17.922
the employers can be fined. By law.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.722
-[in Spanish] It's reserved.
-[in Spanish] Oh, Mari.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.308
Beatriz? I didn't recognize you.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.852
[slurps loudly]

13:32.311 --> 13:33.187
[exhales]

13:35.856 --> 13:38.067
Just because you don't have a US passport

13:38.150 --> 13:39.902
does not mean you are worthless.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.446
You have rights.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.865
You have the right to fair wages.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.577
You have the right to be treated equally

13:48.994 --> 13:52.957
and to earn enough money
to care for your family.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.918
You have the right
to live with dignity and hope.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.044
[applause]

14:04.510 --> 14:05.427
[in Spanish] Ma'am?

14:06.679 --> 14:07.847
Did you sign in?

14:08.305 --> 14:09.348
[in Spanish] No. Thank you.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.725
Every signature
gets us closer to our goal.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.686
To fight for what we deserve.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.027
[Norteño music plays softly]

14:33.122 --> 14:35.291
-[in Spanish] And Nayeli?
-[in Spanish] I don't know.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.757
[Erik, in Spanish] What's wrong?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.638
Where the hell is Nayeli?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.391
Oh, shit. Bakersfield?

14:54.351 --> 14:57.396
[street sounds, siren]

15:02.776 --> 15:05.863
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is this next bus going to Bakersfield?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.198
Oh, no, baby girl. It's going to Alameda.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.993
Oh, okay.
Guess I'll wait for the next one.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.330
Oh. Hi, Pop.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.708
Who runs away to Bakersfield?

15:18.250 --> 15:21.211
I'm not running away.
I'm just visiting my friend, Pop.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.338
Oh.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.007
Are you going to make me go home?

15:25.215 --> 15:28.844
[in Spanish] No. I'm not here to stop you.
I'm here to help you.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.305
You don't want to end up in Riverside.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.681
What's in Riverside?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.642
[chuckles, in Spanish] Exactly!

15:36.018 --> 15:37.519
Exactly.

15:39.063 --> 15:39.897
Are you hungry?

15:42.691 --> 15:46.111
Don't tell Chris,
but I think his new tacos sound weird.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.197
[in Spanish] I do too, kiddo.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.784
But new things are good.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.079
Like you traveling
by yourself, that's something new.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.456
I just need a break from them.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.209
Not that anyone would notice I'm gone.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.090
[in Spanish] Ah, now I understand.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.051
It's a revenge trip.
I'm going to tell your mom

16:09.134 --> 16:10.719
to not let you watch so many novelas.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.305
It's not revenge, Pop. Like...

16:14.515 --> 16:17.434
don't you wanna leave
when Chris and Erik fight all the time?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.354
[in Spanish] Yes, but fights
are temporary, sweetie.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.856
And family is forever.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.733
We always stick together.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.944
Through thick and thin.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.072
But this is real thick, abuelito.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.657
Like peanut butter.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.202
Mama Fina would know what to do.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.041
[sighs, in Spanish]
But you know what?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.628
The people we love
turn into angels,

16:45.170 --> 16:49.633
so they can help us
when the peanut butter gets too thick.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.594
Do you miss Mama Fina?

16:55.431 --> 16:57.641
[in Spanish] Yes, sweetie. Of course.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
Me too.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.690
[in Spanish] You're stronger
than you think.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.942
We're both strong.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.449
The last three buses were wrong.
Maybe I should try tomorrow.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.410
[in Spanish] Good idea!
I'll come with you.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.122
Come on.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.750
Let's go this way.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.174
-What's up, man? How you doing?
-All good.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.885
[mutters under breath]

17:34.887 --> 17:37.765
Wait, did I say 76 or 66?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.725
Think you were counting
in your head, babe.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
Um...

17:42.227 --> 17:44.438
-Yo, how's Nayeli?
-Oh, she's gone.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.647
Yeah, Pop took her home

17:45.731 --> 17:48.150
after she tried escaping
to Fresno or some shit.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.777
Your mamma was not happy.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.529
-Fresno? What the fuck?
-She's safe now.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.283
Anyway, hope your mom doesn't kill you!
Don't tell her I was involved. Bye!

17:56.366 --> 17:57.326
[phone hangs up]

17:58.660 --> 18:01.705
Babe, so I think Nayeli
tried running away to Fresno.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.957
-What? Are you serious? Is she OK?
-I mean, who the hell

18:04.041 --> 18:05.751
runs away to Fresno?
And I don't know, but...

18:06.168 --> 18:07.628
I think she's okay, but...
[sighs]

18:07.711 --> 18:08.879
...I gotta go home real quick.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.298
-Are you gonna come back?
-[sighs] I just gotta check in.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.967
I mean, my mom is going to be
so fucking pissed.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.136
Like, I was was supposed to be
watching her.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.680
-Keep it down! Trying to sleep.
-[sighs] Sorry.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.517
But, look, you gonna be okay?
Doing the count without me?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.435
I mean, I know you said
25 people RSVP'd--

18:23.519 --> 18:25.104
And four showed up. [scoffs]

18:25.187 --> 18:28.565
-It's kind of how volunteering goes.
-[sighs] Okay. I'm gonna be right back.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.567
-I promise, trust me. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.569
-Go. I'll see you soon.
-Okay.

18:35.739 --> 18:36.657
[sighs]

18:36.740 --> 18:38.742
Seventy-six? Sixty-six?

18:38.867 --> 18:40.786
-Sixty-seven?
-Oh, my God! It was 76!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.538
Thanks, dude. [scoffs]

18:44.039 --> 18:47.000
[door opens then closes]

18:50.420 --> 18:51.672
Is Nayeli okay?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.301
[in Spanish] Really?

18:56.802 --> 19:00.139
Mom, I told you I had plans today. I mean,
Chris was supposed to help, but...

19:00.973 --> 19:03.475
-I just can't be in two places at once.
-[in Spanish] Well, I can.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.145
Like a fucking magician.
I'm here. I'm there.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.730
I'm everywhere! Abracadabra!

19:08.814 --> 19:10.399
OK, Amá. Well, I'm here now. I can help.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.110
[in Spanish] Really? You're gonna help me?
Great.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.946
Now I can do backflips
because I'm so happy

19:16.029 --> 19:17.906
you're going to help me with the work

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
that pays for your house, clothes,
and food.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.579
[sighs] I swear, you treat me
like I'm not supposed to have a life.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.081
Like I'm supposed to be working
all the time to make you happy.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.544
[in Spanish] Ay. I'm so sorry, sweetie,
if helping your family survive

19:30.627 --> 19:33.297
-is too much for you.
-Aye, mamá, I'm doing my best.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.674
Look, I have to balance
my life at the bar,

19:35.799 --> 19:38.802
my murals, Nayeli, Yessika,
and helping you with everything else.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.430
-I'm trying!
-I'm trying my best too!

19:41.805 --> 19:44.766
[in Spanish] But multiplied by 100
since I was five!

19:44.850 --> 19:46.935
-And if I can do it, you can too!
-Yeah, Mom?

19:47.060 --> 19:48.687
But that was back in Mexico.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.815
Isn't that what you came here for?
So I wouldn't have to do all of that?

19:51.982 --> 19:54.193
Huh? Or are you just leading
the exact same life

19:54.276 --> 19:57.529
that you sacrificed everything for?
Is that what you want for me and Nayeli?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.074
Because if so...
[sighs]

20:01.158 --> 20:03.827
...you can keep that life, Mom.
I pass.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.174
[sobs]

20:30.520 --> 20:32.689
I have a leftover burrito if you want it?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.193
It's okay.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.909
[whimpers, sniffs]

21:12.187 --> 21:13.021
[exhales]

21:14.106 --> 21:16.108
-Hi. You're welcome.
-Thanks.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.193
[man] Thanks a lot.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.996

21:30.998 --> 21:31.873
[Yessica sighs]

21:33.667 --> 21:35.168
[woman speaking in Spanish] Thank you.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.131
[street sounds, unintelligible chatter]

21:45.137 --> 21:46.179
[inhales]

21:46.722 --> 21:47.597
[clears throat]

21:48.598 --> 21:52.144
Um, I don't mean to be disrespectful,
jefe, but I was...

21:52.436 --> 21:54.313
thinking if I can talk to you.

21:54.771 --> 21:58.066
Sure, that's what I'm known for:
chit-chats and bathroom breaks.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.361
Is it okay if I can finish this pile
tomorrow?

22:01.862 --> 22:04.990
I can't keep asking my kids
to help me to finish my work.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.284
It's just... It's not their job.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.829
Well, if you can't finish it tonight,
then maybe I find women who can.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.457
Yeah.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.294
But Alma and Mari are twice as fast
with the loose threads.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.548
So I should put them on thread trimming

22:21.631 --> 22:23.675
all day, instead of sewing.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.552
I knew you already thought about this.

22:26.094 --> 22:29.473
And that way,
you can complete your quota on time.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.350
You're such a smart man.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.267
[Frank chuckles]

22:32.351 --> 22:34.227
And I can leave this pile here.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.646
[chuckles]

22:37.939 --> 22:38.982
Um...

22:39.399 --> 22:40.400
Uh...

22:42.819 --> 22:43.695
Fine.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.325
