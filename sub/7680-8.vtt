01:20.667 --> 01:22.157
Some people say

01:22.166 --> 01:24.703
there are no more frontiers
left for us to conquer,

01:24.709 --> 01:27.155
but then again, some people

01:27.166 --> 01:28.702
still go out into the wilderness

01:28.709 --> 01:30.165
in search of their dream.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.700
MacGyver!

01:41.709 --> 01:43.700
Hey, Mac!

01:43.709 --> 01:45.700
Trouble is, sometimes that dream

01:45.709 --> 02:21.750
can become a living nightmare.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.739
Darlin'! Oh...

02:23.750 --> 02:27.743
Oh, I've missed you, MacGyver.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.241
Oh, elegant as ever.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.740
As beautiful as ever.

02:31.750 --> 02:32.739
And, also sexy!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.741
How did Bill ever see you before I did?

02:36.750 --> 02:38.741
Oh, just lucky, I guess.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.240
Yeah, I'd say.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.240
How is he?

02:42.250 --> 02:43.786
Terrific.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.248
Really.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.241
And how's the project?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.241
Wonderful, exciting,

02:49.250 --> 02:52.788
and Bill says it's gonna make us rich.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.783
Always said you're my best friend.

02:54.792 --> 02:58.239
Okay, Torg, tie it off! Slow it down.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.239
Okay, Bill.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.787
Hold the drilling bit steady.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.287
Okay, I got it.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.282
Hey, come on, let's go.

03:08.291 --> 03:12.284
That'll take us down
to about 1,800 feet.

03:12.291 --> 03:16.785
Yeah, maybe we'll have
to go down another 2,000.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.282
You gotta have faith.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.781
I smell hydrocarbons.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.282
There's oil down there, son!

03:23.291 --> 03:24.827
Hold it!

03:24.834 --> 03:28.281
Wow! Gas pocket! Whoo!

03:28.291 --> 03:31.283
But it means there's
really oil down there, Bill!

03:31.291 --> 03:32.827
Yeah!

03:32.834 --> 03:35.280
Come on, baby! Come on up!

03:35.291 --> 03:36.827
Hey-uh, hey-uh, hey-uh,
hey-uh, hey.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.827
Oh, I thank you, God.

03:38.834 --> 03:42.827
We gotta let the gas bleed
out before we can drill.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.324
Hey, MacGyver!

03:44.333 --> 03:45.823
We're gonna be rich!

03:45.834 --> 03:46.823
Hey, Pete,

03:46.834 --> 03:48.324
I want you to
meet my best friend.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.823
Oh, yeah!

03:49.834 --> 03:50.823
Whoo!

03:50.834 --> 03:54.326
Damn, MacGyver!

03:54.333 --> 03:56.824
I don't hardly recognize you.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.324
That's 'cause I'm not me anymore.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.823
Where have you been?

04:01.834 --> 04:03.324
Oh, you, get over here!

04:03.333 --> 04:04.869
Get over here with me.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.322
Get over here.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.870
Hey, glad you could drop by my estate.

04:08.875 --> 04:09.864
I was in the neighborhood.

04:09.875 --> 04:10.864
What can I say?

04:10.875 --> 04:11.864
It's good to see ya.

04:12.333 --> 04:12.867
You, too.

04:13.333 --> 04:13.867
It's been a while.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.322
Master of the understatement.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.322
It's been a while.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.322
What was it, Sumatra?

04:17.333 --> 04:18.322
Yeah.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.869
Flew straight in from Texas

04:20.333 --> 04:21.869
all duded up in your fancy hat,

04:21.875 --> 04:23.866
your ten-gallon boots
and put on a party.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.365
Didn't even know where Sumatra was.

04:25.875 --> 04:26.364
I had jet lag...

04:26.875 --> 04:27.864
from heavy-duty partyin'.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.866
Yeah. Before I met you, hon.

04:29.875 --> 04:30.864
Oh, sure, sure.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.365
Was he as hopeless a liar
when he was a kid, huh?

04:32.375 --> 04:34.366
I'd be lyin' if I said no.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.364
Mm-hmm.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.866
Hey, I'm about
to forget my manners.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.365
Hey, Pete!

04:39.375 --> 04:40.364
Get over here.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.911
Got somebody I want you to meet.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.364
MacGyver

04:46.375 --> 04:47.364
Pete Torgut

04:47.375 --> 04:48.911
Hey, Pete, how you doin'?

04:48.917 --> 04:50.908
Pleasure. Heard a lot about you.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.908
Hellcattin' with this clown?

04:52.917 --> 04:55.374
No way! No, I'd help rig the well,

04:55.375 --> 04:56.911
but he'd blow it out.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.908
Oh, MacGyver's just being modest.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.374
Listen, I got some
more pickin' up to do.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.364
Thanks for droppin' down.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.408
So this is what you gave up
hellfightin' for.

05:08.917 --> 05:09.906
You know, wildcat drillin'

05:09.917 --> 05:12.408
isn't exactly the greatest
way to make a living.

05:12.417 --> 05:13.406
Make a living.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.409
Mac, if today's core samples check out

05:16.917 --> 05:18.407
with the geological
reports you brought me,

05:18.417 --> 05:19.907
man, we're sitting on an empire.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.908
You wanna buy a share?

05:23.417 --> 05:25.954
Yeah, line it up here, Pete.
Yeah.

05:25.959 --> 05:26.948
Have a look.

05:26.959 --> 05:27.948
This is our area.

05:28.417 --> 05:30.408
That could be our gas pocket.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.409
Where is that
striation overlay?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.416
Let's see if it matches up.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.406
Laura, look, look.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.415
Oh, you're just amazing.

05:39.417 --> 05:42.409
Man of many, many, many, many,
many, many talents.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.453
I'll say.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.948
Fresh coffee.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.950
Get it while it's hot.
Bill?

05:47.959 --> 05:49.449
Thanks, hon.
Pete?

05:49.458 --> 05:50.948
Oh, thank you.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.450
Put the light on, would you?

05:53.458 --> 05:54.948
Oh, sure.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.948
See how that lower level juts down...

05:58.959 --> 06:00.449
Yeah, but we've gone deeper
than enough already.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.450
Fuse blew again.

06:04.458 --> 06:05.447
Oh, no!

06:05.458 --> 06:06.994
Got a fuse box?

06:07.001 --> 06:07.990
Uh-huh.

06:12.458 --> 06:13.447
See, I was right, Pete.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.995
Where's that second overlay?

06:22.001 --> 06:23.457
Well, there's the problem.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.990
Got a spare fuse?

06:28.001 --> 06:29.992
You're holding it.

06:30.001 --> 06:32.492
I, uh, tried to make do

06:32.500 --> 06:37.494
with shorter orders on the supply runs
-- fuses,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.991
batteries for the radio...

06:40.500 --> 06:42.991
Guess it's kinda catching up to me now.

06:44.500 --> 06:44.989
Gum?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.990
No, thanks.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.991
So things are kinda tight, huh?

06:52.500 --> 06:52.989
Yeah, kinda.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.492
What're you doing
with that gum wrapper?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.991
Well, maybe we can get around

07:04.000 --> 07:06.537
this fuse problem...temporarily.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.536
Great!

07:25.542 --> 07:28.033
You fixed the fuse!

07:28.041 --> 07:29.030
Now why can't I come up

07:29.041 --> 07:30.531
with money-saving ideas like that?

07:32.041 --> 07:37.035
Listen, Laura, when Bill
got hurt, how bad was it?

07:37.542 --> 07:40.534
I thought he was gonna die.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.032
Three months in the burnward.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.032
It was my worst nightmare.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.577
So he quit?

07:48.583 --> 07:51.575
He was the best, you know.

07:51.583 --> 07:56.031
Sure, and probably tough
enough just to last forever.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.574
But I'm not.

07:58.583 --> 08:03.031
And I asked hi
m to make a choice:

08:03.041 --> 08:07.580
hellfighting... or us.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.574
He chose right.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.574
I don't know.

08:12.583 --> 08:16.075
We've put all the
money we saved into it,

08:16.083 --> 08:19.075
every cent that we could borrow.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.573
Nothing's left.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.073
It's all out there...

08:22.583 --> 08:26.622
this land
and that derrick.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.620
If this doesn't work out...

08:33.625 --> 08:37.072
Bill'll go back to hellfighting.

08:37.082 --> 08:41.076
And... I...

08:48.125 --> 08:50.616
Hey, Bill, look at this!
It all checks out!

08:50.625 --> 08:52.115
Let's see.

08:52.125 --> 08:55.617
There it is.
That's it. Oil!

08:55.625 --> 08:58.617
Laura, we're gonna be rich!

09:03.625 --> 09:05.115
It looks good!

09:06.125 --> 09:08.662
We did it, babe!
We did it.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.659
Yeah! Yeah!

09:11.667 --> 09:13.123
We did it!

09:13.125 --> 09:14.661
All right!

09:14.667 --> 09:16.658
We're gonna be rich!

09:21.667 --> 09:23.123
Oh, I love you!

09:42.166 --> 09:43.656
Pete, cut the power!

09:43.667 --> 09:45.703
One of the bulbs blew!

09:45.709 --> 09:47.165
No! Get back, it's gonna blow!

09:47.166 --> 09:48.702
Get outta here! Get out!

09:53.709 --> 09:54.698
Help!

10:00.709 --> 10:02.165
Pete!

10:02.166 --> 10:02.700
Pete!

10:03.709 --> 10:04.698
Oh, God!

10:06.208 --> 10:07.197
Stay back!

10:07.208 --> 10:08.197
Get back!

10:09.709 --> 10:10.698
Come on, get him!

10:11.208 --> 10:11.708
Get it off!

10:14.709 --> 10:16.199
Oh, God.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.744
Turn him over!

10:34.750 --> 10:35.739
Come on!

10:35.750 --> 10:36.739
Hurry!

10:36.750 --> 10:38.741
God, hurry!

11:26.792 --> 11:27.781
Easy, Pete.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.282
You'll be all right.

11:29.291 --> 11:32.783
You know, you got yourself
a simple fracture there.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.282
Got off lucky.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.282
Yeah, I'm a real lucky guy.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.781
Couldn't get any better.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.283
Of course, you know
we're going to have

11:40.291 --> 11:41.781
to give it a pretty good yank

11:41.792 --> 11:44.283
to straighten it, get a splint on it.

11:44.291 --> 11:45.827
Well, what are you waiting for, Doc?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.290
Let's do it!

11:47.291 --> 11:49.828
Oh, I was just wondering...

11:49.834 --> 11:51.290
Do you have any doubts you can do it?

11:51.291 --> 11:52.280
Oh, no, that's no problem.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.290
It has to do with Curie's Law.

11:54.291 --> 11:57.283
Curie's what?

11:57.291 --> 11:58.280
Curie's Law?

11:58.291 --> 11:59.827
Yeah.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.826
You know, the one that says
the magnetic susceptibility

12:02.834 --> 12:04.324
of a paramagnetic substance

12:04.333 --> 12:06.824
is inversely proportional
to the absolute temperature.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.324
You know.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.825
The magnetic susceptibility to the...

12:13.333 --> 12:16.825
On the other hand...
don't think about it.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.325
Oh... whew.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.825
You're real slick, MacGyver.

12:21.834 --> 12:22.823
Well, naked dancing girls

12:22.834 --> 12:24.324
might have been a little better,

12:24.333 --> 12:25.869
but... you know.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.322
Just let everything flow, okay?

12:29.333 --> 12:30.869
Okay.
All right.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.331
Good man.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.870
I get the feeling we're
not rich anymore.

12:34.875 --> 12:35.864
You know, you guys

12:35.875 --> 12:37.331
are losing me here.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.324
You know, there are
all kinds of hydrocarbons

12:39.333 --> 12:40.322
coming out of that hole.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.324
Even with my limited experience,

12:42.333 --> 12:45.370
that generally means there's
oil down there.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.364
I agree.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.867
Just wait for the supply plane,
hire a fire-fighting crew.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.866
Your credit ought to be good

12:51.875 --> 12:53.365
with all that oil coming in

12:53.375 --> 12:56.367
Not inside the next two weeks.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.366
Which is when our lease runs out.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.867
No way we can get a crew here
inside two months.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.912
Well, maybe we ought to consider
putting it out ourselves.

13:04.917 --> 13:05.906
With what?

13:05.917 --> 13:07.908
Know-how, ingenuity...

13:09.375 --> 13:11.366
dynamite wouldn't hurt.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.366
The last time I did that kind of thing,

13:13.375 --> 13:15.912
I used 5 million dollars
worth of equipment and explosives.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.908
We don't have any gear.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.374
And the dynamite
blew away yesterday.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.367
Bill, they used dynamite
up at Tenstrike Mine.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.912
Where's that?

13:25.917 --> 13:27.908
It's an old
strip mining operation.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.908
Played out six, seven years ago.

13:29.917 --> 13:30.906
It's abandoned.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.408
Maybe they left some stuff behind.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.409
We could maybe do it.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.406
No.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.408
I almost lost you once, Bill.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.408
You made me a promise.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.407
No more hellfighting.

13:44.417 --> 13:47.955
You know, Laura,
I've worked with Bill before.

13:48.417 --> 13:49.953
Bet you I could handle it...

13:49.959 --> 13:51.415
with Bill backing me up, of course.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.953
He wouldn't have to go in?

13:52.959 --> 13:54.415
No way.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.953
Who needs him?

13:55.959 --> 13:59.952
I can do that part myself,
providing we find

13:59.959 --> 14:01.950
some dynamite up at the mine.

14:01.959 --> 14:03.415
Listen, does that truck run?

14:03.417 --> 14:05.453
Damn well better.

14:05.458 --> 14:09.451
That mine's 40, 50 miles
other side of the hills.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.450
Well, then, why don't we
take off at first light?

14:16.458 --> 14:20.451
This road would definitely be
an ''E'' ride at Disneyland.

14:20.458 --> 14:23.450
Yeah, it's a roller coaster, all right.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.450
We ought to be reaching
that old mine pretty soon.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.457
Unless we're lost.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.447
Hey, there she is!

14:42.458 --> 14:44.494
Tenstrike Mine up ahead!

14:47.500 --> 14:50.992
Where do you think they stored
the dynamite around here?

14:51.001 --> 14:51.990
Powder shack.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.491
Look for the powder shack.

14:58.001 --> 14:59.992
What do you say-- over there?

15:00.001 --> 15:01.992
Yeah, it looks like it.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.491
Cross your fingers

15:03.500 --> 15:05.991
that they left something
we can use behind.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.491
Yeah, finders keepers.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.538
Well, if there's any dynamite around,
it'd be in here.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.531
Look at that.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.533
Plenty for what we need.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.999
Oh! Oh, right!

15:37.000 --> 15:38.536
You always did have great moves.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.992
I wonder if I could sue the builder?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.536
You know this building's coming down

15:45.542 --> 15:47.032
with the first strong wind.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.532
Hey, you want to live forever?

15:49.542 --> 15:51.533
Thinking about it.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.574
Stuff's been here for awhile.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.074
Yeah. Could be touchy.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.081
Let's see what we got here.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.116
It's dry.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.616
Yeah, too dry.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.616
I'll bet you a lot of the nitroglycerin

17:17.625 --> 17:20.116
has leaked out already.

17:29.667 --> 17:32.124
Well, let's try it.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.116
Pure nitro.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.124
That stuff will go off if you sneeze.

17:42.667 --> 17:43.656
Let's try not to sneeze.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.744
The stuff works good.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.741
Well, that may be unstable,

18:51.750 --> 18:54.742
but there's nothing
worse than pure nitro.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.206
Still...

18:56.750 --> 18:58.741
It's going to be fun
putting it on my fire.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.745
...two... three!

19:04.750 --> 19:07.241
Oh!

19:07.750 --> 19:08.739
You okay?
Yeah.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.241
How does that feel?
Good. Good.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.740
What was it you said to me one time?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.240
You'd rather be burned than bored?

19:14.250 --> 19:15.239
Sure would.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.241
And you know all about that, Mac.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.741
Yeah, but I'm not married

19:19.750 --> 19:21.741
Laura's the reason I gave it up.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.240
There's no question about that.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.786
I have no regrets.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.784
You know, Laura,
I'm starting to understand

19:27.792 --> 19:29.248
what Bill used to do.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.241
Fighting something like that--

19:31.250 --> 19:33.241
that would scare
the hell out of me.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.783
We can put out the fire,
we bring in the well.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.781
That's all I want.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.239
And then I'll settle down.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.786
I'll get fat, I'll have kids.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.248
Uh-huh.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.239
And I'll tell
dumb stories

19:42.250 --> 19:43.239
about how great I used to be.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.282
And how we put out that fire, Mac.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.782
I just love Bill so much.

19:47.792 --> 19:53.788
And there's something in him
that... really scares me.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.282
Come on, this one last time, man.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.781
One last time.

19:56.792 --> 20:00.284
That's all I want. Okay?

20:00.291 --> 20:04.284
It's a rush, Mac!

20:04.291 --> 20:05.280
You got that right.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.827
Come on.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.290
All right, let's do it.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.827
All right!

20:09.834 --> 20:11.290
You know, back in the 1820s,

20:11.291 --> 20:13.282
they used to truck nitro
out to the fields.

20:13.834 --> 20:14.823
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.280
They used to call that
the suicide run, didn't they?

20:17.834 --> 20:18.823
You scared?
You bet.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.825
Me, too. Ain't it great?

20:23.291 --> 20:24.280
Yeah.

20:25.834 --> 20:26.823
Yeah.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.325
Laura, you really think
we still got a chance?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.324
With Bill and MacGyver together?

20:44.875 --> 20:46.866
They can work miracles.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.866
We gotta get this hose laid out

20:48.875 --> 20:49.864
before they get back.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.369
I'll unwrap it.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.364
Okay.

21:07.375 --> 21:09.366
Uh, give me the connection.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.364
All right, take it.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.366
You ever drop one of these?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.366
Not recently. You?

21:17.875 --> 21:19.365
Well, in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

21:19.375 --> 21:20.865
a guy once bet me

21:20.875 --> 21:22.365
that I couldn't balance

21:22.375 --> 21:24.366
a stick of burning dynamite

21:24.375 --> 21:25.364
on my forehead.

21:26.917 --> 21:28.908
Yeah, what happened?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.911
Blew my head off.

21:41.917 --> 21:42.906
Ooh, MacGyver?

21:43.375 --> 21:45.411
You know what I said
about blowing my head off?

21:45.417 --> 21:46.406
Yeah.

21:46.417 --> 21:48.408
Joke, man.

21:48.417 --> 21:49.406
A dumb joke.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.406
Be right back.

21:50.917 --> 21:52.407
Ah. I'm not going anywhere.

21:56.417 --> 21:57.907
Hold, darling.

22:16.959 --> 22:18.415
Hold it, baby, hold it.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.948
Okay, uh...

22:42.959 --> 22:45.450
Pow. You better hurry.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.995
Hand me...
Oh, my...

22:48.001 --> 22:48.990
Hand me your case.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.447
Got it?

22:57.458 --> 22:58.447
Yeah.

23:01.001 --> 23:01.990
Whew.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.489
That's definitely not going to work.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.489
Bill?
What?

23:11.500 --> 23:12.990
Take this case.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.489
Give me one good reason why.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.489
Laura.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.990
Get outta here.

23:17.001 --> 23:17.490
Take it.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.990
Okay.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.491
Now, gently, will ya?

23:25.500 --> 23:26.489
Tell that to be gentle.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.489
Hurry.

23:35.000 --> 23:35.489
Hurry.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.075
You are crazy!

24:29.083 --> 24:34.077
I mean, certifiable.

24:35.625 --> 24:37.616
Yeah?

24:37.625 --> 24:39.616
What does that make you?

24:40.625 --> 24:41.614
Oh...

24:44.083 --> 24:45.619
Oh...

24:46.083 --> 24:48.620
Well, let's get
this fire food...

24:48.625 --> 24:51.082
on the road.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.619
Yeah.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.615
All right, first thing we got to do

24:58.625 --> 25:00.115
is build a little cradle for
that nitro.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.114
Hey, these wagon springs

25:01.625 --> 25:02.614
ought to give that stuff a safe ride.

25:09.125 --> 25:10.615
And some nice
absorbent sand

25:10.625 --> 25:12.115
in case anything drips out.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.116
Hey, I'm with you, Mac.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.661
I want those blast ing sticks to feel

25:15.667 --> 25:19.114
real comfortable on the ride back.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.659
Listen, Bill,
you know any other way home

25:22.667 --> 25:25.124
besides that washboard road we took?

25:25.667 --> 25:28.659
You don't want it to
be too easy, do you?

25:30.125 --> 25:32.662
Well, nitro looks cozy.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.656
Oh, terrific.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.659
Just 54 bumpy miles to go.

25:51.166 --> 25:54.158
Watch that back wheel, Mac.

25:54.166 --> 25:56.157
Here comes the ditch.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.703
Could you wind down a little, please?

25:58.709 --> 26:03.157
Thank you.
You're fine, fine.

26:03.709 --> 26:04.698
It's okay.

26:04.709 --> 26:07.701
I'm sure we'll know when it's not.

26:07.709 --> 26:10.155
Oh, boy, you're a real comfort.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.700
Okay, Pete, crank it
about a quarter of the way open.

26:28.709 --> 26:30.199
Okay.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.206
You must know a lot about hell-fighting

26:37.208 --> 26:38.197
working with Bill, huh?

26:38.750 --> 26:39.739
Too much.

26:39.750 --> 26:42.207
Do you use the water
to wet down the fire?

26:42.208 --> 26:44.745
No, the firefighters.

26:44.750 --> 26:48.743
Most importantly, the explosives.

26:48.750 --> 26:51.207
You go in carrying an explosive charge.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.744
Has to keep being hosed down

26:52.750 --> 26:54.741
so it doesn't just blow from the fire.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.241
Okay, Pete, cut it.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.241
You rig the charge so that, uh,

27:05.250 --> 27:06.740
they can go right into the gut

27:07.250 --> 27:09.241
of the fire, and when it explodes,

27:09.750 --> 27:11.786
it eats up all the oxygen, and...

27:15.792 --> 27:18.249
...it blows out the fire
like a birthday candle.

27:19.792 --> 27:20.781
Simple, huh?

27:20.792 --> 27:24.239
Yeah... when it works.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.783
You know, Laura's real shook up

27:30.792 --> 27:32.783
over what happen ed in that last fire.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.783
It ain't my happiest memory, either.

27:34.792 --> 27:37.283
Hey, watch that bump.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.783
So, what happened in that fire?

27:44.792 --> 27:46.282
Oh, come on, that's...

27:46.291 --> 27:47.781
that's a long story.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.283
I'll tell it to you sometime.

27:59.834 --> 28:02.280
If that's what it's like
going over little rocks,

28:02.291 --> 28:03.827
stay clear of the boulders.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.824
Well, how do you feel
about crossing streams?

28:15.834 --> 28:18.826
Just dip in one toe at a time.

28:23.834 --> 28:26.325
See? No problem.

28:35.875 --> 28:38.332
What was it you were saying?

28:45.333 --> 28:48.325
Well, must be one of those days.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.912
Your linkage spring is busted.

29:20.375 --> 29:21.911
You got a ball-point pen?

29:21.917 --> 29:24.909
There's one in the glove compartment.

29:24.917 --> 29:27.374
Should I bother to ask why?

29:34.917 --> 29:35.406
Thank you.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.908
You always got an answer.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.415
It doesn't always work.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.954
No, your batting average is pretty good.

29:57.417 --> 29:58.953
Just get us back.

29:59.417 --> 30:02.409
Why? Thought you were having fun.

30:02.417 --> 30:04.954
Well, yeah,
but there's oil under that rig,

30:04.959 --> 30:06.950
and I think I can handle being rich.

30:06.959 --> 30:07.948
Yeah?

30:07.959 --> 30:09.415
Yeah. Mansions, yachts,

30:09.417 --> 30:10.953
maybe even a new truck.

30:10.959 --> 30:12.449
Try it, will you?

30:44.458 --> 30:46.449
All right, try it again, Bill.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.449
Yeah.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.991
Hey! Nice going!

30:56.001 --> 30:57.491
Voila!

30:59.001 --> 31:01.993
You can forget about that new truck.

31:02.001 --> 31:04.492
I'll take
a dozen of those ballpoint pens.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.990
I got a good feeling, Mac.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.991
We're gonna beat that fire.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.492
We're gonna win, partner.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.492
The eternal optimist.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.991
That's why I like you.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.991
Yeah.

32:24.583 --> 32:27.040
Boy, I can hardly wait
to see Laura's big smile

32:27.041 --> 32:29.032
when we come bouncing in there.

32:29.041 --> 32:31.578
Don't say bouncing.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.573
Fasten your seat belt, Mac.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.073
The hills are coming.

32:42.083 --> 32:44.074
Everything still looks secure.

33:02.625 --> 33:04.081
Hey! Homestretch!

33:14.625 --> 33:16.115
Pete!
Yeah!

33:16.125 --> 33:17.615
They made it!
All right!

33:30.125 --> 33:32.116
Hey, did you feel that?

33:37.667 --> 33:39.658
We could be in a little trouble here.

33:44.125 --> 33:45.661
MacGyver!

33:45.667 --> 33:46.656
Brakes are gone.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.658
Hang on!

34:02.667 --> 34:04.658
Pete?
They're going awfully fast.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.155
Oh, God!

34:21.708 --> 34:22.164
Oh, no!

34:25.166 --> 34:27.703
Oh!

34:27.708 --> 34:29.165
God!

35:02.750 --> 35:04.741
Piece of cake.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.741
Yeah.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.241
Let's not drop it,

35:26.250 --> 35:29.742
or we might not be around
to pick up the pieces.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.741
Set it down easy.

35:41.250 --> 35:44.242
All right, Billy boy, you tell me,

35:44.792 --> 35:46.248
how do we put that thing out?

35:46.792 --> 35:50.785
Well, the last time I used
a heat-proof vehicle.

35:50.792 --> 35:52.783
Sort of a tank,

35:52.792 --> 35:54.282
with an extensor armon it.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.282
It was computer-controlled

35:56.291 --> 35:59.283
with a directional mechanism
for fine-tuning.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.284
This time I think it's gonna be more
like the old days.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.282
Prayers and guts.

36:05.291 --> 36:07.282
Uh, wait a minute, here.

36:14.291 --> 36:16.828
He's thinking.

36:16.834 --> 36:19.280
I can hear the gears grinding away.

36:24.834 --> 36:27.826
How close am I gonna have to
get to that thing?

36:27.834 --> 36:29.825
Near enough

36:29.834 --> 36:32.826
to drop a charge down to the
well casing.

36:32.834 --> 36:34.324
But the closer you get,

36:34.333 --> 36:37.325
the temperature goes up exponentially.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.824
Eight, maybe ten
degrees a foot squared.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.826
So you gotta go in far as you can,

36:43.333 --> 36:46.325
extending the charge
on the end of the pole.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.823
Looks like I'm gonna need

36:47.834 --> 36:51.326
a longer pole or I'm gonna fry.

36:51.333 --> 36:53.324
Yeah, it looks that way.

36:53.333 --> 36:56.871
Well, I guess I'm gonna
have to entertain

36:57.333 --> 36:59.324
a couple of theories
a few of my buddies

36:59.333 --> 37:01.324
came up with a while ago.

37:01.333 --> 37:05.326
Archimedes and Euclid,
you may have heard of them.

37:05.333 --> 37:08.325
But we're definitely
gonna need some stuff.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.366
Yeah, we're gonna need a heat shield

37:15.375 --> 37:19.368
like this old refrigerator.

37:19.375 --> 37:21.866
We got that.

37:24.375 --> 37:24.864
We got our

37:25.375 --> 37:26.865
transportation.

37:33.375 --> 37:34.364
And the track for it.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.911
And we got our dynamite.

37:43.375 --> 37:46.367
There you are.

37:46.917 --> 37:49.374
You know what?
I think that could work.

37:49.375 --> 37:50.364
Where do we start?

37:50.375 --> 37:53.913
Well, the way you start
any railroad.

37:53.917 --> 37:56.408
You lay track.

38:04.917 --> 38:05.906
You ready?

38:05.917 --> 38:06.906
Ready.

38:06.917 --> 38:07.906
Move it.

38:20.959 --> 38:22.415
Laura, fill thisthermos with all

38:22.417 --> 38:25.409
the liquid nitro you can
squeeze out of those sticks.

38:25.417 --> 38:29.410
And need I say,be careful.

38:46.959 --> 38:47.948
How's it going?

38:48.458 --> 38:49.948
That's great.

39:07.001 --> 39:07.456
Wait a minute.

39:08.001 --> 39:10.447
Bill!

39:13.500 --> 39:15.491
MacGyver, soup's on.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.489
Keep it moving, honey.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.990
Get it down in that sand.

39:18.001 --> 39:18.490
Okay.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.000
Careful now.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.000
Yeah.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.489
Hey, Bill.

39:32.001 --> 39:33.491
Come on, we need some help here, bud.

39:33.500 --> 39:34.489
No.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.491
You can't handle it by yourself.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.990
Not in there.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.490
Bill...

39:40.500 --> 39:41.990
I think that's my choice, son.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.989
No!

39:43.500 --> 39:44.489
And you know why.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.991
That wasn't your fault.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.991
My God, three months in a burnward,

39:49.000 --> 39:50.991
I think that's enough punishment,
don't you?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.536
For three lives.

39:52.542 --> 39:55.989
The guys on my crew, man,
they bought it.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.993
They all bought it.

40:00.542 --> 40:01.998
They're dead, Mac.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.991
If you go in there by yourself,

40:04.000 --> 40:05.536
you're gonna die, too.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.536
So, no.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.537
This one's mine.

40:14.542 --> 40:17.033
You made me a promise.

40:17.041 --> 40:20.533
To let a good friend kill himself, Laura?

40:20.542 --> 40:22.533
I think I said

40:22.542 --> 40:24.032
that was my choice.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.030
All right?

40:25.041 --> 40:26.531
No, Bill!

40:26.542 --> 40:27.531
Stop it!

40:27.542 --> 40:29.032
What's the matter with you?

40:29.041 --> 40:31.032
Please!

40:31.041 --> 40:35.034
Stop it, you two! Stop!

40:35.041 --> 40:36.577
MacGyver!

40:36.583 --> 40:38.039
Please!

40:40.041 --> 40:42.578
Stop it! Have you both gone crazy?

40:42.583 --> 40:43.572
Stop!

40:45.583 --> 40:47.574
What's the matter with you?

40:47.583 --> 40:49.574
Stop, I said!

40:51.583 --> 40:53.073
Stop it!

40:53.083 --> 40:54.072
Stop it!

40:57.083 --> 41:00.575
I said stop it!

41:00.583 --> 41:02.073
Stop!

41:02.083 --> 41:04.574
Get off him!

41:04.583 --> 41:06.073
Bill's right.

41:06.083 --> 41:09.075
You can't do it alone, MacGyver.

41:12.083 --> 41:13.619
And don't say another word, Farren!

41:13.625 --> 41:15.081
Okay!

41:15.083 --> 41:16.072
Honey...

41:16.083 --> 41:18.074
Look, you're going in.

41:18.083 --> 41:21.075
This one last time.

41:21.083 --> 41:22.619
But the two of you together.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.081
That's the way you got this far.

41:24.625 --> 41:25.614
Laura, you know, I...

41:25.625 --> 41:28.082
Look, you'll fry your tail
in there without Bill.

41:28.083 --> 41:29.619
Damn it, he's the best!

41:30.083 --> 41:32.620
So are you.

41:32.625 --> 41:35.617
You heard the lady.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.115
Yeah.

41:47.625 --> 41:49.115
Ow.

42:09.667 --> 42:10.656
Let's go!
Okay, baby, I want you

42:10.667 --> 42:11.656
to keep that water cool.
Okay.

42:11.667 --> 42:12.122
while we head into the fire.

42:14.166 --> 42:17.158
Come on.

42:17.166 --> 42:18.656
Good luck.

42:29.667 --> 42:31.658
Keep it up, honey.

42:46.166 --> 42:49.704
MacGyver, this is as
close as we can get.

42:49.709 --> 42:51.700
Water!

43:01.709 --> 43:02.198
Careful!

43:03.709 --> 43:05.700
That was close.

43:05.709 --> 43:08.200
Very close.

43:10.709 --> 43:11.698
Better check the hitch release.

43:11.709 --> 43:13.745
It has to open easy so
the charge will pop.

43:15.208 --> 43:16.744
Okay, it works fine.

43:16.750 --> 43:19.742
Now let's get it to the shaft.

43:45.750 --> 43:48.241
It's too hot in here.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.241
Turn it all the way up, Pete!

43:52.250 --> 43:53.239
Turn it up!

44:07.250 --> 44:09.241
Keep it coming, Laura.

44:11.792 --> 44:14.283
That's the right amount of tension,
MacGyver.

44:21.792 --> 44:23.282
Oh, it's stuck.

44:23.291 --> 44:23.791
I gotta go out!

44:24.291 --> 44:25.781
Right here, Laura.

44:37.291 --> 44:39.282
Slide it forward, Mac.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.827
You got it!

44:43.291 --> 44:46.829
Now get back in here or you'll be fried!

44:48.291 --> 44:49.280
Laura!

44:49.291 --> 44:50.827
Mac, come on!

44:54.333 --> 44:56.324
Let's keep that canister
moving forward.

45:10.834 --> 45:14.873
It's just about over the shaft.

45:14.875 --> 45:17.332
Turn it up, Pete.

45:24.333 --> 45:25.869
Turn it up.

45:25.875 --> 45:27.866
Pete, come on, yeah!

45:30.333 --> 45:31.869
All right, get ready to move!

45:36.375 --> 45:37.865
Are you ready?

45:38.375 --> 45:39.364
Yeah!
Let's go!

45:39.375 --> 45:41.866
Go! Go, go, go!

46:03.917 --> 46:05.908
All right.

46:05.917 --> 46:06.906
For sure.

46:06.917 --> 46:07.906
Yeah.

46:07.917 --> 46:09.908
For damned sure.

46:20.917 --> 46:22.407
So what's next?

46:22.417 --> 46:24.908
Well, we know there's oil there.

46:24.917 --> 46:27.408
We just need to build
up a new derrick...

46:27.917 --> 46:30.909
Start drilling that hole,
soon as I can work again.

46:30.917 --> 46:32.407
You'll heal.

46:32.417 --> 46:33.406
I know it, buddy.

46:33.959 --> 46:36.951
Think you oughta do
that a little sooner.

46:36.959 --> 46:39.416
Like maybe get someone to help you.

46:39.959 --> 46:40.948
Hire somebody.

46:40.959 --> 46:42.950
Out here?

46:42.959 --> 46:43.948
Where in the world

46:43.959 --> 46:44.948
are we gonna find...?

46:48.959 --> 46:51.416
I've been wanting to take
a nice long vacation,

46:51.417 --> 46:53.453
a little rest and relaxation.

46:53.458 --> 46:55.949
Spend some time with friends,

46:55.959 --> 46:57.950
party down.

46:57.959 --> 47:00.450
I'll help you bring in the well.

47:00.458 --> 47:01.447
Then you're hired.

47:01.458 --> 47:02.447
All right!

47:02.458 --> 47:03.447
I like that.

47:03.458 --> 47:04.447
You're the best.

47:04.458 --> 47:05.447
Right.

47:13.458 --> 47:14.994
Ready... break.

47:15.001 --> 47:15.990
Whoo!
