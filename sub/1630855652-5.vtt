00:02.208 --> 00:04.875
Your legacy, like your Master's,

00:04.875 --> 00:07.583
is one of death and destruction.

00:15.458 --> 00:16.583
Stop!

00:17.916 --> 00:18.958
Destroy it!

00:20.708 --> 00:21.708
No!

00:22.666 --> 00:26.250
You and I share a common goal.
To make this journey.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.375
You, to be reunited
with your long lost friend,

00:29.916 --> 00:33.375
and I, to serve a greater good.

00:34.041 --> 00:36.958
Come with me. Willingly.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.500
Do it.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.000
For Ezra.

00:46.625 --> 00:48.833
No one will be following us.

00:52.541 --> 00:53.625
What can you tell me?

00:53.625 --> 00:56.583
<i>The enemy has built
a massive hyperspace ring.</i>

00:56.583 --> 00:58.000
<i>Do not let it escape.</i>

00:58.000 --> 00:59.458
Engage the hyperdrive.

01:02.541 --> 01:05.666
- That's a tremendous surge in power.
- They're gonna jump.

01:12.875 --> 01:16.416
Mom. I've got a bad feeling.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.583
<i>Hello, Snips.</i>

01:26.791 --> 01:28.666
I didn't expect to see you so soon.

01:34.458 --> 01:35.458
Anakin.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.291
Carson, come in.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.083
I got nothing down here.
Looks like we missed the party.

03:29.583 --> 03:32.333
<i>Copy, General,
there's nothing on the scope.</i>

03:32.333 --> 03:33.458
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

03:34.666 --> 03:35.833
That's what worries me.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.791
Do a full sweep and report back.

03:40.833 --> 03:41.875
<i>Copy, over.</i>

03:43.208 --> 03:44.208
Mom?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.208
Can I come out now?

03:55.791 --> 03:56.791
All right.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.833
But don't wander off too far.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.500
We don't know this planet,
so keep Chopper with you.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.583
Come on, Chop.

04:53.625 --> 04:54.625
Huyang?

04:56.083 --> 04:58.083
I told them to stay together.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.416
But they never listen.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.500
They never listen.

05:54.541 --> 05:55.625
Anakin.

06:00.375 --> 06:02.250
You look the same.

06:03.916 --> 06:05.041
You look old.

06:06.458 --> 06:09.125
Well, that happens.

06:12.666 --> 06:13.916
Actually, what happened?

06:15.541 --> 06:16.541
You lost a fight.

06:17.916 --> 06:19.333
I don't remember.

06:19.875 --> 06:20.875
Trust me.

06:22.458 --> 06:23.666
You lost.

06:27.375 --> 06:28.583
Baylan Skoll.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.333
So, you do remember.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.208
That's good.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.416
Why?

06:39.083 --> 06:40.833
It means you still have a chance.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.041
A chance?

06:46.583 --> 06:47.625
To live.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.916
Tell me what's going on.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.750
I'm here to finish your training.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.291
It's a little late for that.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.291
One is never too old to learn, Snips.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.041
All right.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.500
What's the lesson, Master?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.041
Live...

07:32.875 --> 07:34.000
or die.

07:36.416 --> 07:37.583
I won't fight you.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.500
I've heard that before.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.291
Anything?

08:31.291 --> 08:34.500
No, I'm afraid the map
is broken beyond repair.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.916
Wherever their destination was,
we have no hope of following.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.583
Well, once we find Sabine and Ahsoka,
we can worry about that.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.666
Unless the one thing answers the other.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.625
You think they were aboard that ship?

08:47.625 --> 08:50.875
Every minute that passes
without finding them here,

08:50.875 --> 08:53.375
the alternative becomes less desirable.

08:56.541 --> 08:58.083
We're overdue at HQ.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.500
Senator Organa says she can
only give us cover for so long.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.958
Well, we're not going anywhere
until I know exactly what happened here.

09:05.958 --> 09:08.666
If we stay out here any longer
without reporting in,

09:08.666 --> 09:10.750
people are gonna start asking questions.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.583
Mom.

09:12.583 --> 09:13.916
Not now, Jacen.

09:13.916 --> 09:16.958
Well, we might benefit from people
asking a few more questions.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.208
Not if we don't have any answers.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.666
But, Mom, there's something
about the water.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.166
What is it, Jacen?

09:29.166 --> 09:31.708
There's something out there, Mom.
I can feel it.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.250
Chopper?

09:38.541 --> 09:40.500
Jacen, if there was anything out there,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.083
- Chopper would pick it up on his scanner.
- No, Mom.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.708
General, we need to figure out
what we're gonna tell command.

09:48.250 --> 09:52.166
I'll cover it. What good is a high rank
if you can't use it every now and then?

09:52.166 --> 09:55.333
- Mom. Listen.
- I am.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.166
No, listen to the waves.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.458
General?

10:02.791 --> 10:03.791
Okay.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.833
What are we listening for?

10:08.375 --> 10:09.375
Don't you hear it?

10:18.125 --> 10:19.250
The waves crashing?

10:19.916 --> 10:22.708
No. The lightsabers.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.375
Carson, get your squadron airborne.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.208
I need you out over the ocean,
low altitude, full sweep.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.750
- We already did that.
- Well, we're doing it again.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.333
- Huyang, you're with me in the <i>Ghost.</i>
- Right away.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.541
Jacen, good work. Chopper, stay with him.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.791
What am I missing? What just happened?

11:21.791 --> 11:24.208
Jacen has abilities.

11:24.208 --> 11:27.333
His father, Kanan Jarrus, was a Jedi.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.000
Okay. We better get on it then.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.291
Lander, get everyone moving,
we're going back up again.

12:06.666 --> 12:09.333
Looks like you don't have
much left to offer.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.125
I haven't taught you everything yet.

12:51.416 --> 12:52.500
Come on!

12:53.583 --> 12:54.750
Forward!

12:57.250 --> 12:58.250
Master!

12:59.708 --> 13:00.875
Hurry up, Snips!

13:03.416 --> 13:04.416
Wait!

13:17.333 --> 13:19.000
This is the Clone Wars.

13:21.458 --> 13:22.875
Yeah, no kidding.

13:26.416 --> 13:29.000
This was one of our first missions.
Why are we here?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.083
You tell me.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.708
I don't understand.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.416
That's your problem.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.750
Master, wait!

13:51.916 --> 13:52.916
Gotta keep up!

13:54.500 --> 13:56.208
What about my training?

13:56.208 --> 13:57.666
This is your training!

15:04.125 --> 15:05.166
I'll be right back.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.916
Come on, Snips.

15:14.416 --> 15:15.750
The battle's not over yet.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.708
There are more
Separatist droids approaching.

15:41.291 --> 15:42.375
Is there a problem?

15:46.583 --> 15:48.000
We lost so many.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.333
There's always a price to be paid.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.666
It was my fault.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.041
They were following my orders.
I got them killed.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.166
Come here.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.041
This is war, Ahsoka.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.625
As Jedi, it's our job to lead.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.791
That doesn't mean we don't make mistakes.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.500
But our mistakes cost lives.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.416
That doesn't bother you?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.708
Of course it does.

16:27.583 --> 16:28.625
This...

16:30.458 --> 16:32.333
This isn't what I trained for.

16:33.041 --> 16:34.958
We must adjust to the times.

16:36.125 --> 16:39.208
Look, when Obi-Wan taught me,
we were keepers of the peace.

16:40.375 --> 16:45.041
But now, to win this war,
I have to teach you to be a soldier.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.750
Is that all I'll have to teach
my own Padawan one day?

16:55.250 --> 16:56.250
How to fight?

16:57.833 --> 16:59.208
Do you even want a Padawan?

17:00.625 --> 17:01.666
Hmm?

17:01.666 --> 17:04.375
You know, teaching's not all
it's cracked up to be.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.791
Really? What makes you say that?

17:07.708 --> 17:08.833
I'm joking.

17:08.833 --> 17:09.958
You're joking?

17:09.958 --> 17:11.166
Yeah, I'm joking.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.375
How can you joke at a time like this?

17:13.375 --> 17:14.583
What would you prefer?

17:15.250 --> 17:16.250
I don't know.

17:16.250 --> 17:19.833
Tell me. What do you want?
You want me to be more serious?

17:19.833 --> 17:21.166
I'd prefer it.

17:21.166 --> 17:25.041
Listen, I'm teaching you how to lead,
how to survive,

17:25.666 --> 17:28.000
and to do that
you're going to have to fight.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.458
What if I wanna stop fighting?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.375
Then you'll die.

17:46.916 --> 17:47.916
Let's go.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.625
General, how many more times
are we gonna make this circuit?

18:59.625 --> 19:01.083
There's nothing out here.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.541
<i>Try widening your sweep
along the coast.</i>

19:04.083 --> 19:05.916
We're gonna press our fuel reserves.

19:05.916 --> 19:09.041
<i>I appreciate that, Carson.
Now, widen your search.</i>

19:09.041 --> 19:10.416
Copy, over.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.208
Carson's not wrong.

19:26.958 --> 19:30.125
Sabine and Ahsoka seem lost
and soon we'll be stranded out here.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.875
Luckily, the New Republic
is only a short transmission away.

19:34.875 --> 19:39.291
I was surprised they changed their mind
and approved your mission.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.708
Oh, they never changed their mind.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.625
No, I just came anyway.

19:44.666 --> 19:45.875
For all the good it did.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.000
I see. So, this mission is unauthorized.

19:50.666 --> 19:53.291
Yeah. Some General I am.

19:54.916 --> 19:56.541
Maybe those Senators were right.

19:57.916 --> 19:59.958
I got us out here chasing ghosts.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.750
You do things your way because you care.

20:03.750 --> 20:05.583
This is why people like you.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.083
Huyang, where are they?

20:15.375 --> 20:17.666
People don't just vanish into thin air.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.458
Well, no. Normally, no.

20:22.791 --> 20:24.666
Is there a chance they're out here?

20:25.416 --> 20:28.166
Always. Especially with Lady Tano.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.041
Yeah, she is tenacious.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.375
So was her Master.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.666
Yeah? What was he like?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.708
Intense.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.000
<i>Mom?</i>

20:46.000 --> 20:47.250
Yes, Jacen, what is it?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.083
<i>Chopper thinks
he has something heading...</i>

20:50.083 --> 20:53.083
<i>Three-two-three mark one-five-seven.</i>

20:53.083 --> 20:54.416
Copy, we'll check it out.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.583
<i>Chopper says
you're gonna have to get low.</i>

20:58.416 --> 20:59.416
How low?

20:59.416 --> 21:02.208
<i>She wants to know how low.</i>

21:02.208 --> 21:05.375
<i>Pretty low, as low as you can.
Just go, Mom, please.</i>

21:05.375 --> 21:08.041
All right, the droid said low.

21:09.291 --> 21:10.416
Oh, wonderful.

21:42.541 --> 21:44.041
Nice work, Commander.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.291
We'll secure the perimeter.
Come on, come on, let's go!

22:17.583 --> 22:18.958
I don't know this battle.

22:20.791 --> 22:22.541
This was the Siege of Mandalore.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.000
We had parted ways by now.

22:26.916 --> 22:29.250
- Looks intense.
- It was.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.458
You did well.

22:33.666 --> 22:36.416
You're a warrior now,
as I trained you to be.

22:36.916 --> 22:39.458
Is that all?

22:41.750 --> 22:44.375
Ahsoka, within you will be
everything I am.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.416
All the knowledge I possess.

22:48.291 --> 22:51.666
Just as I inherited knowledge
from my Master and he from his.

22:53.666 --> 22:55.083
You're part of a legacy.

23:01.458 --> 23:05.000
But my part of that legacy
is one of death and war.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.791
But you're more than that,

23:08.916 --> 23:10.416
because I'm more than that.

23:16.916 --> 23:18.208
You are more, Anakin.

23:19.750 --> 23:23.750
But more powerful and dangerous
than anyone realized.

23:27.291 --> 23:28.666
Is that what this is about?

23:29.541 --> 23:31.333
If I am everything you are...

23:31.333 --> 23:32.583
You've learned nothing.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.000
Don't say that.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.208
Back to the beginning.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.041
I gave you a choice.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.500
Live...

23:48.583 --> 23:49.583
or die.

23:52.666 --> 23:53.916
No.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.166
Incorrect.

24:34.208 --> 24:35.708
You lack conviction.

24:56.875 --> 24:58.000
Time to die.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.666
I choose to live.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.375
There's hope for you yet.

26:13.875 --> 26:15.000
Anakin!

28:03.458 --> 28:05.375
<i>We got her, we got her.</i>

28:08.291 --> 28:09.833
<i>Get her inside.</i>

28:09.833 --> 28:12.333
<i>Copy.
You are clear. Repeat, clear.</i>

28:19.666 --> 28:20.791
Anakin.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.041
Anakin.

28:42.791 --> 28:43.958
They got her, Chop!

29:40.291 --> 29:42.541
Welcome back, Lady Tano.

29:47.541 --> 29:49.083
How long have I been out?

29:49.083 --> 29:50.333
One rotation.

29:51.125 --> 29:54.666
However, you might have been
lost for good, if not for Jacen.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.500
Jacen is here?

29:58.500 --> 30:02.208
With his mother and a squadron of X-wings.

30:02.208 --> 30:04.583
All unauthorized, of course.

30:11.250 --> 30:12.250
And Sabine?

30:12.958 --> 30:15.208
No, we have not found her.

30:16.541 --> 30:19.125
We were hoping you could explain
what happened.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Ahsoka!

31:11.833 --> 31:13.625
I owe you my thanks.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.875
I heard you fighting.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.458
You did?

31:18.458 --> 31:21.458
Yeah, lightsabers.
Who were you fighting with?

31:22.375 --> 31:23.625
Hey, I have an idea.

31:24.333 --> 31:27.541
Huyang, why don't you show Jacen
inside your starship?

31:27.541 --> 31:29.541
I've been in a starship before.

31:31.125 --> 31:32.458
A Jedi starship?

31:33.666 --> 31:36.208
Come along.
I'll show you the training room.

31:37.458 --> 31:40.666
You have a training room in your starship?
Will you train me?

31:40.666 --> 31:41.750
No.

31:42.666 --> 31:45.125
- Do you know how to build a lightsaber?
- Yes.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.458
- Will you teach me?
- No.

31:51.166 --> 31:53.708
I know you've just recovered,
but I have to ask.

31:55.708 --> 31:56.791
Where's Sabine?

31:58.875 --> 32:02.458
The last time I saw Sabine,
she was holding this.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.500
And that's significant?

32:06.375 --> 32:09.916
She might have left an impression on it.
Like a memory.

32:10.541 --> 32:12.416
So, we'll know what happened.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.250
Possibly.

32:28.041 --> 32:29.041
<i>Stop!</i>

32:30.000 --> 32:31.333
<i>Step away from her!</i>

32:32.333 --> 32:34.708
<i>Sabine... Destroy it!</i>

32:37.541 --> 32:38.541
<i>No!</i>

32:43.458 --> 32:44.541
<i>Stay back!</i>

32:45.500 --> 32:48.166
<i>But you're not
like her though, are you?</i>

32:48.833 --> 32:50.208
<i>More than you know.</i>

32:51.625 --> 32:54.000
<i>You and I share
a common goal.</i>

32:55.666 --> 32:56.750
<i>To make this journey.</i>

32:57.666 --> 32:59.916
<i>Come with me. Willingly.</i>

32:59.916 --> 33:02.833
<i>And I give you my word,
no harm will come to you.</i>

33:03.583 --> 33:06.791
<i>Sabine, you will be reunited
with your friend.</i>

33:10.250 --> 33:12.750
<i>Do it. For Ezra.</i>

33:29.208 --> 33:30.416
They took her with them.

33:33.375 --> 33:34.375
Then she's alive.

33:37.375 --> 33:40.500
Yes. At least she was
when she left Seatos.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.416
We have to go after them.

33:48.875 --> 33:49.958
I'm afraid...

33:51.750 --> 33:53.166
it's not that simple.

33:56.916 --> 33:58.625
General, we have a problem.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.625
- What else?
- It's the fleet. They're on their way.

34:02.625 --> 34:05.791
- They're a little late.
- I don't think they're coming to help.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.041
I'll deal with this.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.166
You can work out a way to find Sabine.

34:17.833 --> 34:18.833
Right.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.333
You can't be serious.

35:23.333 --> 35:25.458
<i>Do you have Morgan Elsbeth in custody?</i>

35:27.500 --> 35:28.500
No.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.250
<i>Do you have evidence
of Imperial Remnant activity</i>

35:31.250 --> 35:34.041
<i>or of Grand Admiral Thrawn's return?</i>

35:34.041 --> 35:35.125
No.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.541
<i>Then I'm afraid
there's nothing more I can do.</i>

35:38.541 --> 35:42.666
<i>You and Ahsoka Tano are to return
to Coruscant with the fleet.</i>

35:43.458 --> 35:47.166
I'm not sure she'll agree to that.
I'm not sure I agree to that.

35:49.291 --> 35:52.958
<i>Hera, the Senate oversight committee
is going to determine</i>

35:52.958 --> 35:56.208
<i>if your command should be
permanently suspended.</i>

35:59.166 --> 36:02.125
<i>You are going to need her testimony
to help you.</i>

36:03.541 --> 36:04.541
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:09.958 --> 36:12.916
I don't know how you score this,
but we're losing right now.

36:19.250 --> 36:20.666
I know how to follow Sabine.

36:44.666 --> 36:46.416
I'm not sure I like this plan.

36:46.958 --> 36:48.916
Yes, I would like to second that.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.041
There's no other way.

36:51.041 --> 36:54.333
Without the map, we don't have
the proper hyperspace coordinates.

37:00.625 --> 37:02.041
<i>And you think they do?</i>

37:03.291 --> 37:04.791
Only one way to find out.

38:05.916 --> 38:09.583
Up ahead. I think that
is one of the larger ones.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.250
Yeah.

38:17.708 --> 38:18.708
That'll do.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.041
Wish me luck.

39:20.958 --> 39:22.958
<i>General, we got incoming.</i>

39:22.958 --> 39:26.208
No good, Carson. They can't interrupt,
they'll frighten the pod.

39:26.208 --> 39:28.375
- <i>How much time do you need?</i>
- I don't know.

39:28.375 --> 39:30.458
- Just don't let them approach.
- <i>Copy.</i>

39:59.083 --> 40:02.791
<i>This is Captain Teva out of Adelphi Base,
please identify yourself.</i>

40:02.791 --> 40:06.333
Captain Teva. My, aren't you
far from home?

40:07.166 --> 40:09.958
<i>Repeat, please identify yourself.</i>

40:09.958 --> 40:13.791
Captain, you know very well who we are
and why we are here.

40:14.750 --> 40:17.000
Now, where is General Syndulla?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.500
<i>I'm afraid
that's classified information.</i>

40:19.500 --> 40:22.833
In fact, you're gonna have to halt
your approach to the planet

40:22.833 --> 40:25.125
until I receive confirmation
that the general

40:25.125 --> 40:27.166
has indeed completed her mission.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.250
<i>Mission?</i>

40:29.083 --> 40:32.250
<i>Captain, the reason we are here
is because there was no mission.</i>

40:34.708 --> 40:37.125
I respectfully disagree.

40:37.125 --> 40:39.958
Look, we're all on the same side here.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.750
Tell us what Ahsoka Tano
and General Syndulla are up to,

40:43.750 --> 40:45.458
and perhaps we can help.

40:47.375 --> 40:50.041
The best way you can help
is to maintain your distance

40:50.041 --> 40:53.916
until I can confirm that General Syndulla
has completed her mission.

40:53.916 --> 40:55.666
Arm the tractor beam.

40:56.708 --> 40:58.416
Tractor beam powering up, Captain.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.458
I'll give you one last chance,
Captain Teva.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.000
Explain the nature of this mission

41:05.000 --> 41:07.791
or I will see to it
that you are stripped of your rank

41:07.791 --> 41:10.375
for resisting a direct order
from Fleet Command.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.250
Okay, but you're not gonna believe me.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.500
Mom, is she really gonna talk to them?

41:22.625 --> 41:23.833
That's the idea.

41:26.208 --> 41:27.208
Wow!

41:29.166 --> 41:31.166
It's just like the stories you told me.

41:31.166 --> 41:34.708
How the whales took Ezra
and the bad guys far, far away.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.083
And they saved us.

41:41.458 --> 41:44.000
Now they'll take Ahsoka to where Ezra is?

41:44.916 --> 41:46.208
That's the hope, kiddo.

42:43.666 --> 42:45.000
Hey!

42:45.583 --> 42:46.666
Get in there.

42:48.416 --> 42:49.791
Move us in.

42:49.791 --> 42:53.416
All right, all right.
But you best come back inside.

43:31.625 --> 43:34.208
You're certain they know
where Sabine was taken?

43:35.500 --> 43:36.791
I have no idea.

43:37.791 --> 43:39.708
- What?
- No idea.

43:41.583 --> 43:43.041
We'll just see where it goes.

43:43.041 --> 43:45.000
It could go anywhere.

43:46.791 --> 43:47.833
I know.

43:49.250 --> 43:51.166
But that's better than going nowhere.

44:07.750 --> 44:11.291
<i>Correct. The whales will transport
her and her ship.</i>

44:11.291 --> 44:13.500
<i>Or, at least, that's the plan.</i>

44:13.500 --> 44:15.916
Captain, I'm receiving a signal
from the <i>Ghost.</i>

44:15.916 --> 44:18.083
<i>Captain Girard, this is General Syndulla.</i>

44:18.083 --> 44:20.875
<i>I'd move your fleet out of there
if I were you.</i>

44:24.708 --> 44:27.208
Evasive maneuvers,
get clear of their path.

45:31.666 --> 45:34.500
Ahsoka, looks like they're about to jump.

45:36.083 --> 45:38.083
<i>Sorry you can't make the trip.</i>

45:38.083 --> 45:41.666
Nah, it's all right. Jacen's too young
to travel between galaxies.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.666
Hera, I'll find them.

45:46.583 --> 45:47.875
I promise.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.375
May the Force be with you.
