<i>AMY: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager... </i>

00:03.089 --> 00:04.964
- Are you really going to go here?
- That depends.

00:04.982 --> 00:06.155
On whether or not I go here?

00:06.178 --> 00:07.555
That might have something to do with it.

00:07.578 --> 00:09.802
There was a $2,000 application fee.

00:09.846 --> 00:11.812
- It's non-refundable.
- Non-refundable?

00:11.932 --> 00:13.678
I recognize you from the newspapers.

00:14.046 --> 00:15.211
Johnny D.

00:15.250 --> 00:18.910
I'm going to lose $2,000 if I
decide not to go to the school.

00:18.957 --> 00:22.266
Well, you wanted to be sure you
got in, and, well, you got in.

00:22.297 --> 00:23.955
Ricky would never be comfortable

00:23.979 --> 00:25.903
with my coming to school
here if you're here.

00:25.924 --> 00:27.889
If you were really in love with Ricky

00:27.893 --> 00:28.960
and you cared what he thought,

00:28.968 --> 00:31.658
you wouldn't even consider
leaving him to come to school here.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.910
This lawyer came to see me today

00:33.936 --> 00:37.054
and he said I could sue the
school and make millions of dollars

00:37.077 --> 00:38.118
and they wouldn't have to pay it,

00:38.141 --> 00:39.416
it would be their insurance company.

00:39.447 --> 00:40.150
What?

00:40.190 --> 00:41.589
- Omar is leaving me!
- What?

00:41.589 --> 00:43.920
This company he works
for wants him in New York.

00:43.951 --> 00:46.219
How could you think this is about money?

00:46.251 --> 00:48.558
I want to feel satisfied
that I have made every effort

00:48.558 --> 00:49.895
to make this relationship work out.

00:49.895 --> 00:51.803
Well, that's pretty much what
someone says when they want

00:51.835 --> 00:53.915
out of a relationship without any guilt.

00:53.964 --> 00:55.112
I knew it was about money.

00:55.104 --> 00:56.065
You tricked me.

00:56.100 --> 00:58.768
Yeah, I did. And you fell for it.

Does your wife want anything else?

01:18.675 --> 01:20.521
Shh. No, no. We're fine.

01:51.928 --> 01:53.133
(SIGHS)

02:04.402 --> 02:06.047
I have to go, I have to get him to bed.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.943
You going to tell me what
you came over here for or not?

02:08.009 --> 02:10.226
I know you came over here for
something other than a free meal.

02:10.251 --> 02:11.760
All right, I just... 

02:11.815 --> 02:13.379
I feel funny talking in front of him.

02:13.392 --> 02:14.887
He's asleep. And he's three.

02:14.917 --> 02:15.898
He won't remember. Go ahead.

02:15.906 --> 02:17.627
I know Amy wants to go
to school in New York,

02:17.639 --> 02:20.599
and I don't think she wants
to get married before she goes.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.496
I'm trying, I'm really trying
to give her what she wants,

02:23.509 --> 02:26.180
to make going to school
in New York possible.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.401
But I don't really know exactly
how I'm going to do that.

02:28.426 --> 02:30.064
That's because there's no way to do that.

02:30.098 --> 02:31.936
There's no way she can
go to school in New York

02:31.967 --> 02:34.545
and be married to you and be
a responsible wife and mother.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.938
I know it's tough being a teenage mom,

02:36.973 --> 02:38.549
but Amy's had a lot of support,

02:38.543 --> 02:40.132
a lot of financial support.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.159
What, you supposed to pay for
everything for the next four years?

02:42.203 --> 02:44.512
I'd like to, but we need some help

02:44.549 --> 02:46.570
paying for wherever Amy
wants to live in New York.

02:46.570 --> 02:48.259
You shut that down right now.

02:48.290 --> 02:50.424
All right? She does not need
to get whatever she wants,

02:50.474 --> 02:52.739
it's not good for her,
really, shut that down.

02:53.658 --> 02:56.659
She should be thinking about
her son and about you, frankly.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.062
You've been good to Amy.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.410
Well, except for getting her pregnant.

03:01.429 --> 03:03.162
But for the last few years anyway.

03:03.282 --> 03:05.383
You two should get married this
summer like you said you would,

03:05.402 --> 03:07.216
and she should stay in
California to go to school.

03:07.266 --> 03:09.356
I don't think she's going to
get married to me this summer

03:09.381 --> 03:10.907
or stay here to go to school.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.052
She wants what she wants.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.573
No. You have to make her stay here

03:13.560 --> 03:14.943
and get married and go to school.

03:14.979 --> 03:16.000
I don't want to make her.

03:16.046 --> 03:17.858
I want her to want to stay here,

03:17.882 --> 03:19.883
- and I want her to want to get married, but...
- But what?

03:19.917 --> 03:20.898
But she doesn't want to do that

03:20.911 --> 03:22.451
so I want her to have what she wants

03:22.432 --> 03:25.204
because I did get her pregnant.

03:25.324 --> 03:27.150
Oh. Guilt.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.470
I see.

03:28.645 --> 03:31.061
You planning to pay for that little
slip-up the rest of your life?

03:31.061 --> 03:32.250
Uh, yeah.

03:32.306 --> 03:34.108
Because I want John around
for the rest of my life

03:34.102 --> 03:35.497
and it's the responsible thing to do.

03:35.503 --> 03:36.998
How the hell are you going to
live in two different cities

03:37.017 --> 03:38.594
and be parents to a three-year-old?

03:38.714 --> 03:41.490
If you were willing to help Amy
out with the housing in New York.

03:41.753 --> 03:44.581
No. I am not willing. And I can't.

03:44.631 --> 03:46.824
And I bought this place so I would
not be able to help anyone out

03:46.821 --> 03:48.404
because I don't want to help anyone out,

03:48.524 --> 03:51.106
I want to tie up all my money
in something that I want.

03:51.116 --> 03:52.376
I earned it and I'm going to spend it,

03:52.401 --> 03:54.510
and I'm not going to spend
it on Anne, or Amy, or Ashley,

03:54.504 --> 03:57.169
I'm going to spend it on me. I did already.

03:57.582 --> 03:59.421
You know what, I'll talk to Amy,

03:59.484 --> 04:00.297
I'll be the bad guy.

04:00.297 --> 04:02.330
Oh, no, no, no. No. I
don't want you to do that.

04:02.361 --> 04:04.257
You came to me for help,
that's the help I can give you.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.396
That's okay. I was just
exploring some options,

04:06.421 --> 04:07.679
trying to figure out a plan.

04:07.698 --> 04:09.033
It's not possible!

04:09.067 --> 04:10.989
Do not dream this dream with Amy!

04:13.460 --> 04:14.921
Could you please put the chair backs up,

04:14.911 --> 04:17.063
we should be landing shortly.

04:17.611 --> 04:18.964
Ew! Get off me!

04:19.346 --> 04:20.185
Sorry.

04:20.305 --> 04:21.548
You were on me first.

04:21.611 --> 04:23.645
So you were intentionally on me?

04:24.085 --> 04:26.273
Geez, Ben. Give it up.

04:26.479 --> 04:28.022
It was nice while it lasted.

I don't know what "it" is,

04:50.667 --> 04:54.915
but it's awfully early for you
to be up and getting anything.

04:54.950 --> 04:55.603
You got what?

04:55.660 --> 04:58.187
I got a good twenty-four
signatures, so far.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.768
Is this something political?

04:59.783 --> 05:02.771
No, it's not, it reaches
across all politics,

05:02.773 --> 05:04.462
all socio-economic groups,

05:04.468 --> 05:06.761
all religions and faiths and philosophies.

05:07.929 --> 05:09.680
Or maybe not, but it's big.

05:09.964 --> 05:12.426
Out of all people surveyed, adult people,

05:12.483 --> 05:14.040
not one has ever used algebra

05:14.068 --> 05:15.911
in their daily life or even at work.

05:15.937 --> 05:19.252
I wish I had this coffee
before you came in.

05:20.007 --> 05:23.169
Have you ever used algebra
in your work or in your life?

05:23.289 --> 05:25.027
- No.
- Twenty-five.

05:25.045 --> 05:27.116
And the day isn't over.

05:27.236 --> 05:29.543
Aren't you supposed to
be going over to Kathy's

05:29.537 --> 05:31.508
to study for the mid-term today?

05:31.502 --> 05:33.129
Yeah, but what's the point?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.474
I'm never gonna use algebra.

05:34.499 --> 05:35.694
I'm afraid you are.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.234
You're going to be taking a second year

05:38.234 --> 05:40.155
of algebra in your junior year.

05:40.275 --> 05:41.425
I'm afraid I'm not.

05:42.061 --> 05:43.371
Because if I keep going with this,

05:43.383 --> 05:45.148
no one's going to be taking algebra.

05:45.898 --> 05:47.599
I'm going to change things around here.

05:47.634 --> 05:48.364
Around where?

05:48.420 --> 05:50.672
Around school, the entire school system.

05:51.037 --> 05:53.594
I'm gonna get algebra removed
from the school curriculum.

05:53.607 --> 05:56.756
Well, unless you're going to
make that to happen by Monday,

05:56.779 --> 05:59.081
I suggest you get on over to Kathy's

05:59.081 --> 06:02.316
and get some help with that midterm.

06:04.051 --> 06:07.251
What's the worst that can
happen if I just fail algebra?

06:07.871 --> 06:09.842
I mean, I should fail,

06:09.962 --> 06:13.376
otherwise there's no point to my efforts
to get algebra removed from schools.

06:13.401 --> 06:14.703
Ethan,

06:16.123 --> 06:21.435
I... I agree with you in that
requiring all students to take algebra

06:21.435 --> 06:24.382
could possibly keep a
student who's bad at algebra

06:24.382 --> 06:26.665
from succeeding in school overall.

06:26.907 --> 06:29.530
And even though algebra is used by

06:29.650 --> 06:33.516
accountants, financial
planners, engineers, physicists,

06:33.541 --> 06:35.825
and a lot of occupations,

06:35.849 --> 06:38.083
not everyone does get algebra

06:38.083 --> 06:41.530
and not everyone uses
it in their adult life.

06:41.562 --> 06:43.837
But some people do.

06:44.214 --> 06:45.466
I haven't found one.

06:45.586 --> 06:46.892
Good morning.

06:49.112 --> 06:50.464
Well, good morning.

06:50.932 --> 06:51.999
What's all this?

06:52.033 --> 06:54.480
I thought you might like breakfast in bed.

06:55.068 --> 06:57.705
I should be making you breakfast in bed.

06:59.516 --> 07:02.019
So, is this what you call
being your own person?

07:02.075 --> 07:02.845
Waiting on me?

07:02.876 --> 07:05.595
Yes. I wanted to make
you breakfast and I did.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.025
But you're making me breakfast because
you don't want to go to New York.

07:08.145 --> 07:13.217
Not true. I wanna go,
just maybe not this year.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.791
It's something we have to figure out.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.610
I like that. I like that it's
something "we" have to figure out,

07:18.679 --> 07:20.968
sounds like two mature adults
in a healthy relationship.

07:20.964 --> 07:25.205
Omar, I'm really proud of you,

07:25.405 --> 07:27.707
but I want you to be proud of me too.

07:27.938 --> 07:30.273
And if I'm just your live-in girlfriend

07:30.279 --> 07:32.250
trying to get into college while you have

07:32.256 --> 07:33.488
this big important job,

07:33.513 --> 07:36.022
then I don't think you're
going to be so proud of me

07:36.080 --> 07:38.476
and I'm certainly not
going to be proud of me.

07:38.883 --> 07:42.600
Look, I need to finish all my core classes

07:42.630 --> 07:46.353
and it doesn't cost
anything for me to live here,

07:46.590 --> 07:48.018
I don't know, maybe

07:48.068 --> 07:49.613
you could work it out with your company

07:49.619 --> 07:51.590
so you can work from here the first year.

07:51.603 --> 07:53.974
The first teachers we're
working with are in New York,

07:54.337 --> 07:56.648
if I'm going to be involved in
this project from the ground up,

07:56.664 --> 07:57.471
I have to be there.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.829
Okay. But not every day,

07:59.036 --> 08:00.987
not every weekend, not all the time.

08:01.006 --> 08:02.571
Why don't you find a couple of schools

08:02.577 --> 08:04.298
that look good to you in New York, and

08:04.354 --> 08:06.256
let's see whether or not
your credits would transfer

08:06.281 --> 08:07.820
and how long it'll take you to get in.

08:08.045 --> 08:10.341
And you're not my
girlfriend, you're my fiancée.

08:10.398 --> 08:11.630
We're getting married.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.188
Maybe you could even

08:13.220 --> 08:15.190
get into a college in
New York for next fall,

08:15.310 --> 08:17.768
and in that case, I guess you
should continue classes here,

08:17.975 --> 08:19.689
but we don't know, maybe you can get in.

08:20.024 --> 08:22.510
Let's get all the information
before we make any decisions.

08:22.529 --> 08:24.850
- That sounds totally reasonable to me.
- Good.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.232
So you made me breakfast,

08:30.352 --> 08:32.802
why don't we take a drive to the
beach later and I'll buy you lunch?

08:32.836 --> 08:35.904
Mmm. Sorry. I told Grace
I'd have lunch with her.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.889
- You're having lunch with Grace?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:38.009 --> 08:39.058
Enjoy.

08:48.887 --> 08:51.396
I just want some options, that's all.

08:51.516 --> 08:53.630
And I'll probably go to
school right here next fall,

08:53.692 --> 08:56.552
but I don't have any
acceptance letters yet,

08:56.583 --> 08:58.623
but I do have options.

08:58.854 --> 09:01.050
And it's April, I have
a month or two to decide.

09:01.113 --> 09:03.046
Plus the school we went to visit in Utah,

09:03.046 --> 09:04.705
it was amazing.

09:04.755 --> 09:07.539
And it's really only like four
or five hours away if you drive?

09:07.659 --> 09:10.586
Yeah. I guess. But four or five
hours is four or five hours.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.100
You want to be four or five hours from me?

09:12.156 --> 09:15.484
I don't want to be, but I
can't like move the school here.

09:15.503 --> 09:17.074
Well, I'm already so far behind,

09:17.093 --> 09:18.451
I could just transfer and go with you.

09:18.476 --> 09:20.534
Um, I'm sure you could but... 

09:20.590 --> 09:22.899
I think we should wait to see how
it goes when you get your cast off.

09:23.019 --> 09:25.138
You're probably going to be
playing football again next fall.

09:25.207 --> 09:27.756
Yeah, but it wouldn't mean anything
if you weren't here to watch.

09:27.791 --> 09:28.654
That's sweet.

09:28.666 --> 09:29.949
I saw this class, it's

09:29.993 --> 09:31.820
for young couples who want to get married,

09:31.862 --> 09:33.240
who aren't engaged yet.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.330
It's a thing on campus.

09:35.517 --> 09:39.115
You want to take that class
with me, as kind of a first step?

09:39.235 --> 09:40.335
Well, I just... 

09:40.455 --> 09:42.653
I feel like I'm just finishing high school

09:42.687 --> 09:45.410
and I have all these decisions
to make about college.

09:45.530 --> 09:47.431
Maybe it's just not the right time.

09:47.474 --> 09:50.396
It's spring, this is
when people are in love.

09:50.516 --> 09:51.954
I think the class is just starting up.

09:51.982 --> 09:52.748
Really?

09:53.318 --> 09:54.882
Huh. How long is the class?

09:54.918 --> 09:56.965
It's a couple of hours,
once a week for four weeks.

09:56.987 --> 09:57.779
Huh.

09:58.273 --> 09:59.424
Well. Let me think about it.

09:59.449 --> 10:00.870
It's through the campus ministry.

10:00.924 --> 10:02.859
Okay! I'll think about it.

10:09.773 --> 10:10.934
Amy!

10:12.803 --> 10:14.772
Someone is waiting to say good morning.

10:17.518 --> 10:19.620
Hey. Hey, buddy.

10:19.740 --> 10:20.915
Hi.

10:21.222 --> 10:22.611
Wanna get in bed with Mommy?

10:22.731 --> 10:25.226
No, he doesn't. He wants
Mommy to get out of bed.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.333
It's 9:00.

10:26.346 --> 10:27.717
- Is it?
- Yeah.

10:28.329 --> 10:29.953
I was so tired.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.384
Yeah, nothing I can do about that.

10:32.504 --> 10:33.610
Now I have to go to work.

10:33.635 --> 10:34.792
Are you going to drop John off?

10:34.842 --> 10:37.232
- Drop him off where? It's Saturday.
- Oh, right. I forgot.

10:37.264 --> 10:38.959
Really, if you're going to
get a shower before I leave,

10:38.963 --> 10:40.867
you have to get up, I
need to get downstairs.

10:40.898 --> 10:42.500
I showered when I got in.

10:42.620 --> 10:43.933
Did John have breakfast?

10:43.968 --> 10:45.497
- At 6:00.
- Oh.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.080
Amy? Don't you want to get up?

10:47.071 --> 10:49.890
Yes. Yes, Ricky.

10:50.074 --> 10:52.493
All right, I'll get up. I'm getting up.

10:57.410 --> 11:00.326
- You want some breakfast?
- No, I'm fine, you can go.

11:00.376 --> 11:01.158
I know I can go,

11:01.177 --> 11:03.135
I just thought I'd make you
breakfast, hear about your trip.

11:03.173 --> 11:05.669
I'll tell you when you get home from
work, there's not that much to tell.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.352
- Really?
- Really.

11:07.390 --> 11:09.780
Did you have a good time? Wasn't
really there to have a good time,

11:09.900 --> 11:11.839
I was there to check out the school and

11:12.089 --> 11:13.622
we'll talk later.

11:14.729 --> 11:16.788
Where'd you lose my mother's wedding band?

11:16.833 --> 11:18.878
- What?
- I notice you're not wearing your wedding band

11:18.902 --> 11:20.435
or your engagement ring.

11:22.104 --> 11:25.497
I must have taken them off
and put them in my purse.

11:25.547 --> 11:27.499
Yeah. You must have. At a party?

11:27.549 --> 11:28.791
Didn't want anyone to know you're married?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.845
Well, I'm not married, but no.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.018
I think... 

11:34.212 --> 11:35.883
maybe I... 

11:36.552 --> 11:40.240
Yes, yes, I took them off when I was
going through security at the airport.

11:40.271 --> 11:44.091
Because I didn't want to set
off any alarms or anything.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.993
So, they have to be in my purse.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.562
I'll find them, you go to work.

11:53.587 --> 11:55.489
You better. It's my mother's wedding band.

11:55.508 --> 11:57.786
It means a lot to her even
if it means nothing to you

11:57.810 --> 11:59.493
and she gave it to you as a wedding gift.

11:59.613 --> 12:01.176
We're not even married

12:01.182 --> 12:02.702
and I don't think we're
going to be getting married,

12:02.709 --> 12:04.880
and we have to give the rings
back if we're not getting married.

12:04.913 --> 12:05.979
Yeah, of course.

12:06.013 --> 12:07.145
Of course, we're not getting married

12:07.158 --> 12:08.403
or, of course, we're giving the rings back?

12:08.416 --> 12:11.699
Ugh, what happened to, "Welcome
home, it's so good to see you?"

12:11.706 --> 12:12.986
It was good to see you

12:13.021 --> 12:14.721
until I noticed you
weren't wearing your rings.

12:15.722 --> 12:17.724
- We have to talk.
- I said that.

12:37.358 --> 12:38.253
Hey!

12:38.373 --> 12:39.391
What did you bring me?

12:39.511 --> 12:41.394
Bring you? What did I bring you?

12:41.437 --> 12:43.373
- From?
- New York?

12:43.407 --> 12:46.373
Anything you can get in
New York, you can get here.

12:46.649 --> 12:48.832
You can't get a "I heart
New York" T-shirt here.

12:48.857 --> 12:50.340
Did you want an "I
heart New York" T-shirt?

12:50.365 --> 12:52.198
I can order one over the internet for you,

12:52.217 --> 12:53.969
but later, I gotta go to work.

12:54.013 --> 12:56.572
That's not the same,
ordering over the internet.

12:57.717 --> 13:00.595
So, how was it? Was it fun?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.140
- What'd you do?
- I had some fun.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.904
Last night, coming back,

13:03.898 --> 13:07.471
Amy fell asleep on me and I
pretended to be married to her.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.198
And she didn't know you were
pretending to be married?

13:10.217 --> 13:11.211
No.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.301
- So how was the marriage?
- Short.

13:13.421 --> 13:15.115
That was the highlight
of your trip to New York?

13:15.178 --> 13:17.186
No. Don't tell my dad, but

13:17.306 --> 13:18.619
I found an apartment.

13:18.644 --> 13:19.776
If I could get that apartment,

13:19.763 --> 13:21.478
I would definitely go to Hudson University.

13:21.503 --> 13:22.955
Why don't you get a dorm room

13:22.930 --> 13:24.913
and be like a normal person for a change?

13:24.957 --> 13:27.465
I'm getting a dorm room too,
but I want the apartment.

13:27.585 --> 13:28.491
Dorms are too loud.

13:28.554 --> 13:31.320
You can't really sleep in
them and you can't study,

13:31.440 --> 13:33.447
but they're great for social purposes.

13:33.567 --> 13:36.631
And I have to go to work
now, like a normal person,

13:36.631 --> 13:37.789
so you have to go.

13:37.832 --> 13:39.165
You didn't meet any girls there?

13:39.228 --> 13:42.506
I met a few. I even had a date.

13:42.563 --> 13:44.271
- Kind of.
- No details, please.

13:44.308 --> 13:46.142
You know, maybe you
should go out some time.

13:46.185 --> 13:48.369
Have you met somebody
that you would go out with?

13:48.388 --> 13:49.502
Maybe you could call them

13:49.514 --> 13:52.905
and that would give you another
reason to get out of my room

13:53.118 --> 13:54.951
other than I have to go to work.

13:55.545 --> 13:56.446
What? Have you?

13:56.484 --> 13:59.300
No. No, I haven't met a single guy

13:59.331 --> 14:01.345
who wouldn't think
that dating an ex-hooker

14:01.381 --> 14:04.029
was all about getting her to have free sex.

14:04.149 --> 14:06.031
I forgot. Sorry.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.859
Nice you can forget, I can't forget.

14:08.865 --> 14:12.570
And, just for the record, I was
forced into doing what I did!

14:12.595 --> 14:14.484
I know, I know, I said I was sorry.

14:14.515 --> 14:16.561
I'm never going to have
a normal life, you know,

14:16.580 --> 14:18.006
because anyone I would
ever be interested in

14:18.050 --> 14:19.427
would never be interested in me

14:19.445 --> 14:20.828
because I am an ex-hooker!

14:20.866 --> 14:23.119
My face was on the cover of a newspaper!

14:23.144 --> 14:26.622
Anyone can go on the internet and see this

14:26.666 --> 14:30.263
and read "hooker." I
hate that word. I hate it!

14:33.479 --> 14:36.551
Like I could ever get a date! I hate you!

14:38.190 --> 14:40.384
Guess I should have
gotten her the T-shirt.

14:42.345 --> 14:44.310
I'm on my way to work.

14:44.942 --> 14:48.795
I forgot about her history,

14:48.839 --> 14:51.219
I just asked if she'd
found somebody to date.

14:52.230 --> 14:54.432
I... I'll... 

14:55.433 --> 14:58.799
Geez. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'll fix it, I will.

14:58.849 --> 15:00.189
You will.

15:08.014 --> 15:10.255
Hey! What's going on?

15:10.375 --> 15:12.669
Uh, Lauren, what's going on?

15:12.675 --> 15:15.716
I don't know, what's
going on with you, Madison?

15:15.903 --> 15:16.817
We're babysitting.

15:16.779 --> 15:18.431
Amy or John?

15:18.551 --> 15:19.951
- John.
- And where's Amy?

15:19.976 --> 15:24.631
I guess that's up to you and Amy.

15:24.650 --> 15:28.529
Yeah. We don't know where she is
or where she's going or anything.

15:32.011 --> 15:32.977
(SIGHING)

15:38.985 --> 15:40.799
Well, look who's here.

15:41.725 --> 15:43.840
Hello, Benjamin. Good to see you again.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.480
Good to be here. So what
do you need me to do?

15:46.600 --> 15:49.959
There's a bunch of boxes and packing
in the freezer that need to be removed.

15:50.396 --> 15:52.442
Why is he telling me and
you're not telling me?

15:52.430 --> 15:55.627
Because he's taking over on
Saturdays while I take off.

15:56.785 --> 15:59.575
- For how long?
- For as long as I want.

15:59.695 --> 16:01.890
So, uh, now you're my boss?

16:01.902 --> 16:03.879
I'm in charge of getting
things done on Saturday

16:03.930 --> 16:05.663
and that's what needs to
get done this Saturday.

16:05.694 --> 16:07.533
We had two large deliveries yesterday.

16:07.653 --> 16:09.757
- Thanks.
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

16:09.782 --> 16:11.459
I won't be spending my day in the freezer.

16:11.465 --> 16:13.265
Until you learn how to
run the cash register,

16:13.286 --> 16:15.932
package the meat or
something about cooking,

16:15.945 --> 16:18.223
there's really not a lot else you can do.

16:22.220 --> 16:24.685
- It's a fine line.
- I know that.

16:24.805 --> 16:26.624
Just keep it business,
I don't want any trouble,

16:26.624 --> 16:28.564
but I would love Saturdays off.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.954
And I would love the extra pay.

16:38.913 --> 16:41.209
I don't know what I
could have done with them.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.879
I swear I never take them off,

16:42.892 --> 16:45.284
I'm so afraid of losing them.

16:46.151 --> 16:48.466
They had to have fallen off somewhere.

16:48.586 --> 16:49.956
Like at a party or something?

16:49.974 --> 16:50.744
No.

16:50.864 --> 16:51.870
Are you sure?

16:51.883 --> 16:54.229
Yeah, I'm sure. I wasn't at any parties.

16:54.349 --> 16:56.031
I wanted to go to some parties,

16:56.099 --> 16:59.253
but I didn't because I
didn't want Ricky to get upset

16:59.284 --> 17:00.936
and have any reason

17:01.056 --> 17:02.788
to tell me not to go to school there.

17:02.825 --> 17:03.783
Hey, bud!

17:03.903 --> 17:04.683
Hi.

17:05.209 --> 17:05.840
What is that?

17:06.147 --> 17:07.674
I found it.

17:09.019 --> 17:10.243
Thank you.

17:13.943 --> 17:16.815
Ew. It's disgusting. It's an old band aid.

17:16.871 --> 17:17.816
Okay. But,

17:17.816 --> 17:20.343
Amy, don't you see that
Ricky already has a reason

17:20.367 --> 17:22.752
to tell you not to go
to school in New York?

17:22.872 --> 17:24.579
Yeah, what would you do with John?

17:24.585 --> 17:28.208
Well, either I'll take him with me
or else he'll stay here with Ricky.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.441
I'll get an apartment close to school

17:30.561 --> 17:32.237
and I'll put John in day care

17:32.231 --> 17:33.726
and I'll go to school.

17:33.732 --> 17:35.403
That's going to be really hard.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.849
Yeah, and really expensive.

17:36.874 --> 17:38.125
I mean, who's going to pay for that?

17:38.169 --> 17:39.126
I have a scholarship.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.365
That covers an apartment and day care?

17:41.403 --> 17:43.067
How much money does Ricky make

17:43.080 --> 17:44.419
working in that butcher shop?

17:44.437 --> 17:45.745
Not enough.

17:46.077 --> 17:47.978
So if you could take care of John, then

17:48.098 --> 17:50.800
I'll go talk to my dad and see
if he'd be willing to help me out.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.120
Us out. Us.

17:52.157 --> 17:53.671
Are you still getting married?

17:53.665 --> 17:55.967
You guys, we're, like,
already living together,

17:55.998 --> 17:57.788
we're engaged, we have a kid,

17:57.908 --> 17:59.333
practically married already.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.004
I don't see what the big deal is.

18:01.505 --> 18:04.131
All right, I'll be back. I'll
just going to go say bye to John.

18:05.303 --> 18:06.910
She's lost her mind.

18:06.922 --> 18:08.987
She's not gonna marry
Ricky. I can't believe it!

18:09.031 --> 18:10.276
It's what she always wanted.

18:10.282 --> 18:12.309
I know! And it's like she had a baby,

18:12.341 --> 18:14.293
but she doesn't know what a baby is.

18:15.801 --> 18:18.035
Don't worry about a thing.

18:18.028 --> 18:20.619
- Yeah, we'll be fine.
- Yeah, we're fine.

18:21.063 --> 18:24.240
And, uh, where did you tell
Ricky that you're going?

18:24.253 --> 18:26.343
Just so we know.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.105
I just want to talk to my Dad.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.172
Amy, you were gone a couple of days,

18:31.210 --> 18:32.611
you don't see your dad
every day when you're here.

18:32.661 --> 18:34.438
- I know that.
- You can't take John with you?

18:34.476 --> 18:35.439
We need babysitters?

18:35.439 --> 18:36.703
It's just for an hour or two.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.280
Are you going over to ask for a loan?

18:38.330 --> 18:40.382
I've already asked for a
loan for you. He said no.

18:40.413 --> 18:42.335
Well, you're not his daughter.

18:45.037 --> 18:46.595
Oh. Hi.

18:47.246 --> 18:48.691
Look, about last night... 

18:48.710 --> 18:51.700
Do you mind? We're having a
personal conversation here.

18:51.675 --> 18:54.309
No we're not, we're working here.

18:57.587 --> 18:58.776
What about last night?

18:58.801 --> 19:01.041
I'm sorry, I'm carrying heavy boxes here.

19:01.028 --> 19:02.605
We're going to be having
a lot more deliveries,

19:02.618 --> 19:04.451
because we're the local
supplier for Geoff's now.

19:04.445 --> 19:05.139
Just so you know.

19:05.114 --> 19:07.292
I got George to switch over to us.

19:07.804 --> 19:11.433
So I'll be doing a lot more of this.

19:11.553 --> 19:14.073
Probably. But I'll be doing
a lot more of that too.

19:14.098 --> 19:17.132
And you'll be doing a whole lot more
of this after I go off to school.

19:17.176 --> 19:19.259
Yeah. Unless I hire someone else

19:19.259 --> 19:21.086
or Bunny hires someone else.

19:21.393 --> 19:22.488
Are you going off to school?

19:22.506 --> 19:24.652
Yes. I am. And,

19:24.772 --> 19:26.460
look, I'm going to be getting an apartment.

19:26.498 --> 19:29.069
If Amy, or you and Amy and John,

19:29.106 --> 19:30.514
would care to share it with me... 

19:30.514 --> 19:33.718
I mean, help you out with your expenses.

19:33.838 --> 19:36.301
Just something to think about, boss.

19:43.171 --> 19:45.017
Ok, so, I just need... 

19:45.054 --> 19:47.175
about, $18,000

19:47.213 --> 19:47.882
plus the deposit.

19:47.876 --> 19:49.518
Amy, what's 1500 times 12?

19:50.297 --> 19:51.698
Oh, right.

19:51.955 --> 19:53.500
Eighteen thousand.

19:53.519 --> 19:57.235
I just need $18,000 plus the deposit.

19:57.423 --> 19:58.768
Just think of it as a student loan.

19:58.768 --> 20:01.277
The Bank of Dad folded.
There are no more loans.

20:01.328 --> 20:03.473
You're over 18. You have your own family.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.643
You have your own finances.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.839
Welcome to the world of adults.

20:05.864 --> 20:08.104
Where, by the way, people take
care of their own children.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.500
- Uh, you're not taking care of me.
- Oh, but I am.

20:10.719 --> 20:11.983
The whole goal of any
parent is to make sure

20:11.964 --> 20:13.434
the child is self-sufficient.

20:13.611 --> 20:15.105
Let's see what you can do without my help.

20:15.092 --> 20:15.937
Go get 'em, tiger.

20:15.993 --> 20:18.430
Dad, I will be self-sufficient,
once I get out of college,

20:18.452 --> 20:19.879
but right now I need a loan.

20:19.941 --> 20:22.150
So you can go to New York to go to college,

20:22.168 --> 20:23.257
away from your husband and son.

20:23.269 --> 20:25.659
I don't know if I'm taking
John with me yet or not,

20:25.647 --> 20:26.817
I mean, maybe I will.

20:26.937 --> 20:28.982
If I can also come up with
the money for a day care.

20:29.038 --> 20:31.622
- You're not going anywhere.
- I am, I'm going somewhere.

20:31.622 --> 20:33.574
And if you don't want to help me then fine.

20:33.631 --> 20:35.589
I don't want to help you. You know why?

20:35.652 --> 20:37.415
You have no business going to New York.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.355
You should stay right
here, and get married,

20:39.403 --> 20:41.996
and raise your son with your
husband and go to college.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.173
You get a free apartment and free day care.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.481
Who gets a free apartment
and free day care?

20:45.499 --> 20:48.526
I work at that day care. And I'm
sick of working at that day care.

20:48.559 --> 20:49.898
Listen to what I'm saying here, Amy,

20:49.923 --> 20:51.268
I've always given you good advice,

20:51.388 --> 20:53.289
remember all the things I've
been right about in the past?

20:53.358 --> 20:54.928
Eat your vegetables, brush your teeth,

20:55.048 --> 20:56.433
and don't have sex until you're married.

20:56.424 --> 20:59.101
I took your advice on two out of the three.

21:00.557 --> 21:01.672
Dad, come on.

21:01.697 --> 21:03.656
No, you're talking about twenty grand,

21:03.681 --> 21:05.533
I just bought a restaurant.
I don't have twenty grand.

21:05.729 --> 21:07.879
And if I did, I wouldn't give it to
you because it's the wrong thing to do.

21:07.911 --> 21:10.614
All right. Well, fine. I just had to ask.

21:10.620 --> 21:11.859
So now you're going to go ask your mother?

21:11.884 --> 21:13.484
Or Nora or Margaret.

21:13.454 --> 21:16.420
Because they'll understand
education is important to a woman.

21:16.414 --> 21:18.692
So is money. See if any of those
broads give you twenty grand.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.550
- Yeah, I will.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

21:24.354 --> 21:25.581
Hi.

21:25.616 --> 21:27.314
Who are you? What do you want?

21:27.434 --> 21:28.934
Aren't you the church organist?

21:29.191 --> 21:30.849
Kathy, Ethan. Is everything okay?

21:30.880 --> 21:32.726
Yeah, we're taking a survey.

21:32.951 --> 21:33.896
Hi. I'm Kathy.

21:33.908 --> 21:36.661
Oh yeah, the one who didn't listen
to her father either, how you doing?

21:36.655 --> 21:37.937
Well. Thank you.

21:37.969 --> 21:40.246
We just wanted to get your
signature on something.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.285
No politics.

21:41.335 --> 21:43.724
Interferes with business, I
don't want any calls or emails.

21:43.718 --> 21:45.520
What survey? Is this something for school?

21:45.537 --> 21:46.440
Yeah.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.606
Have you ever used
algebra in your adult life?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.169
No. And don't ask her, she's not an adult.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.709
No one has. That's why I feel
it shouldn't be taught in school,

21:52.747 --> 21:53.823
or it should be an elective.

21:53.848 --> 21:54.880
Is this to avoid a test?

21:54.912 --> 21:57.890
Yes. A midterm. He's avoiding, not me.

21:57.915 --> 21:59.429
Let me tell you something, all of you.

21:59.549 --> 22:01.463
Sometimes you got to do
things you don't want to do.

22:01.481 --> 22:03.421
And if you don't get anything
else out of taking algebra,

22:03.396 --> 22:05.548
you should get that. You
got it? Get out of here.

22:06.305 --> 22:07.707
Oh, nice.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.040
You are not going to New York.
The whole thing is ridiculous.

22:10.059 --> 22:12.855
Dad, if I don't go now, I may
never have this chance again.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.989
Amy, that's what being
a parent is all about.

22:15.109 --> 22:17.091
Missing opportunities in life.

22:17.129 --> 22:18.555
Never doing what you really want to do.

22:18.612 --> 22:20.357
Never being all you could have been.

22:20.604 --> 22:21.828
It's about settling.

22:21.948 --> 22:24.412
Settle. I don't care if
you love Ricky or not.

22:24.605 --> 22:26.291
He's John's father, he's good to you,

22:26.295 --> 22:28.115
he's good to your son, he's a hard worker,

22:28.140 --> 22:30.975
and he's come back from the depths
of hell to be a decent human being.

22:31.043 --> 22:33.484
So you get some appreciation
of that and suck it up.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.453
Hmm.

22:34.459 --> 22:37.626
You know, I think that should make me cry,

22:37.695 --> 22:39.972
but, for some reason,

22:40.092 --> 22:41.449
it's just funny.

22:42.437 --> 22:44.395
Dad, you're funny.

22:44.515 --> 22:46.941
No, I mean, maybe that's how
it was in the olden times,

22:46.929 --> 22:48.413
but I'm not going to settle.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.548
I want what I want.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.009
You want it all and you can't have it all.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.548
Or maybe I can.

22:52.773 --> 22:54.539
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Amy.

23:01.951 --> 23:05.061
So Amy would be settling?
Marrying Ricky would be settling?

23:05.074 --> 23:06.018
Aw, you know what I mean.

23:06.025 --> 23:07.927
Uh, no. I don't know what you mean.

23:08.047 --> 23:10.692
But I don't want my son to marry
someone who would be settling.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.868
Like he wouldn't be settling?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.601
If he's willing to
settle, why shouldn't she?

23:13.651 --> 23:14.753
Excuse me?

23:14.740 --> 23:15.585
Oh, come on,

23:15.641 --> 23:17.562
they're trying to make this work
without taking the final step,

23:17.568 --> 23:18.995
they had a kid, they have to get married.

23:19.013 --> 23:20.065
No, they don't.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.923
I know that. I want them to think that.

23:22.268 --> 23:22.899
Oh!

23:22.905 --> 23:24.526
Because it would be better for John.

23:24.877 --> 23:27.285
The kid is the most
important person in this,

23:27.310 --> 23:29.422
he had no say in this, why
should he be the one hurt?

23:29.456 --> 23:31.502
He deserves a mom and a dad
who are married to each other

23:31.544 --> 23:32.572
whether they want to be or not.

23:32.692 --> 23:34.460
So they're both miserable,
the kid should be happy.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.111
Wow.

23:35.231 --> 23:37.263
You are really not making a case here.

23:37.302 --> 23:40.161
Yeah, I know. The more I
talk, the worse it sounds.

23:40.412 --> 23:42.608
Am I wrong? Could I be wrong?

23:42.728 --> 23:44.591
I think I'm wrong, but maybe
that's what I'm wrong about.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.424
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:47.319 --> 23:50.954
I have a confession to make.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.569
The other day I told
Ricky not to marry Amy.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.090
That's why I'm looking for an apartment.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.829
I thought it was because Anne's
gonna take back the house.

23:56.885 --> 23:58.130
Yeah, that too, but

23:58.174 --> 24:00.120
mostly because I feel I betrayed you by

24:00.170 --> 24:02.135
telling Ricky not to marry Amy.

24:02.255 --> 24:03.312
You're entitled to your opinion,

24:03.287 --> 24:05.277
I can see where you would
think it's a bad idea.

24:06.427 --> 24:09.606
So, I'm living in your
house and not paying any rent

24:09.726 --> 24:11.577
and you've been a good friend and... 

24:11.585 --> 24:14.423
I told my son not to
marry your daughter and

24:14.543 --> 24:16.607
- that's not a problem?
- No.

24:16.851 --> 24:19.285
He's not listening to you any
more than she's listening to me.

24:19.405 --> 24:21.068
He's trying his damnedest
to get her to marry him.

24:21.099 --> 24:23.609
My point is, I said it, I betrayed you.

24:23.677 --> 24:24.947
I don't care.

24:25.861 --> 24:27.813
I told Ricky I'd try to
help him out and talk to Amy,

24:27.826 --> 24:28.777
and that was all for naught.

24:28.802 --> 24:32.319
You have no idea how much guilt
I've been holding over this?

24:32.349 --> 24:34.539
I was almost driven to drink again.

24:34.577 --> 24:36.404
Over those two? Please.

24:36.524 --> 24:37.981
I was so proud of them when they eloped.

24:37.993 --> 24:41.060
And then, it's as if they missed a movie

24:41.071 --> 24:42.867
and now he's trying to drag
her back to the theater.

24:42.892 --> 24:45.488
And even if he gets her in, neither
of them are going to enjoy the show... 

24:45.838 --> 24:47.841
- Should I go on?
- Nah.

24:47.961 --> 24:50.349
- What is the point of all this?
- It's fun.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.708
We haven't found one single
person who uses algebra,

24:52.739 --> 24:55.674
therefore algebra is a complete
waste of time and I've proven it.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.201
You're still going to
have to take the test,

24:57.182 --> 25:00.555
so sooner or later we're going
to have to stop walking around

25:00.598 --> 25:02.150
and go back to your house and study.

25:02.270 --> 25:03.927
No, I think we should keep going.

25:04.047 --> 25:06.285
Unless of course we find
the one freak in the universe

25:06.323 --> 25:08.131
who uses algebra and then I'll quit.

25:20.795 --> 25:22.666
Hi. We're taking a survey.

25:22.697 --> 25:24.962
Oh, did you need some help
calculating the results?

25:25.169 --> 25:27.552
No. So far, it's a hundred percent.

25:27.672 --> 25:30.524
I'm trying to get algebra removed
from the requirements in high school

25:30.528 --> 25:32.670
by asking people if
they've ever used algebra

25:32.733 --> 25:35.317
and so far, no one ever has.

25:35.361 --> 25:38.232
Um, I think maybe she has.

25:38.295 --> 25:40.185
Are you Danica McKellar?

25:40.305 --> 25:41.149
Yes, I am.

25:41.217 --> 25:44.077
Danica McKellar? I know that name.

25:44.102 --> 25:46.210
Are you a stripper?

25:46.860 --> 25:48.055
A what?

25:48.268 --> 25:49.343
What are you doing?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.626
Complimenting the lady.

25:50.746 --> 25:52.997
She's an actress and a mathematician.

25:53.022 --> 25:54.543
She writes books on math.

25:54.780 --> 25:58.270
<i>Math Doesn't Suck, Kiss My
Math, Hot X, Girls Get Curves?</i>

25:58.390 --> 26:00.391
All I get from that is something dirty.

26:01.651 --> 26:04.936
He has issues with women. And algebra.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.501
And we have an algebra
midterm to study for.

26:07.563 --> 26:10.035
- Bye.
- No. Wait.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.932
- I'll help you.
- I don't need any help, he does.

26:12.944 --> 26:15.553
And I'm helping him. Or trying to.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.218
Well, wait a minute. I mean... 

26:17.261 --> 26:18.913
why not let her have a shot at helping me?

26:18.926 --> 26:20.985
- How many people have you interviewed?
- Thirty-three,

26:21.105 --> 26:23.363
- counting you.
- And I'm the only one who uses algebra?

26:23.381 --> 26:26.115
Yeah. So ninety-nine
percent do not use algebra.

26:26.121 --> 26:27.110
Not exactly.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.519
Thirty-two out of 33 is not 99 percent.

26:29.556 --> 26:30.494
I could have told him that,

26:30.513 --> 26:31.689
but he won't listen to me.

26:31.752 --> 26:32.772
He doesn't want to believe

26:32.740 --> 26:34.648
that a girl is better in math than a guy.

26:34.642 --> 26:36.488
I had the same problem
with guys in high school.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.890
Girls not being good at math
and science is such a stereotype.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.068
Not girls, good looking girls.

26:41.188 --> 26:44.265
You can't look like that and be
good in math, it just doesn't add up.

26:46.023 --> 26:48.613
- Get it?
- You do need help.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.507
I don't know what you're so upset about.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.620
Because,

26:56.740 --> 26:59.355
I wanted to be the one to
inspire you to love math.

26:59.392 --> 27:00.837
Not that... stripper!

27:00.881 --> 27:01.955
She's not a stripper,

27:02.264 --> 27:04.410
although she could be one
if she wanted to, I'm sure.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.086
That is not a compliment,

27:06.149 --> 27:08.495
- that a woman looks like a stripper.
- It's not?

27:08.821 --> 27:10.723
They have to be attractive, right?

27:10.779 --> 27:12.681
They're taking their clothes off for money.

27:13.037 --> 27:14.702
If they didn't look good, then

27:14.822 --> 27:16.028
who would pay?

27:16.709 --> 27:17.961
Am I wrong?

27:19.487 --> 27:20.651
Oh... 

27:21.195 --> 27:22.534
you could be a stripper.

27:22.772 --> 27:24.086
Is that what you want me to say?

27:24.124 --> 27:26.050
Because you are good looking enough

27:26.050 --> 27:28.096
to take your clothes off
for money. If you wanted.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.992
I mean, I wouldn't want you to do that,

27:31.010 --> 27:32.575
I hope you wouldn't do that, but

27:33.313 --> 27:34.688
- you could.
- You...

27:34.808 --> 27:37.235
are so stupid.

27:37.267 --> 27:40.044
Danica didn't seem to
think I was... stupid.

27:40.088 --> 27:43.572
I'll just wait outside for
my grandmother, I texted her.

27:45.024 --> 27:47.878
I don't get it. I'm
learning algebra for you!

27:51.457 --> 27:52.424
(SIGHING)

27:54.260 --> 27:55.399
I'm hungry.

27:58.052 --> 28:00.173
Hey. I'm home.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.719
Well, yes you are, how was it?

28:02.750 --> 28:03.726
(PHONE RINGING)

28:03.745 --> 28:05.447
Oh. My phone.

28:06.079 --> 28:08.515
- Hey, look, it's your dad.
- No!

28:08.635 --> 28:10.292
Hi, Mr. Enriquez.

28:11.287 --> 28:12.444
How are you?

28:13.658 --> 28:14.709
8:00?

28:15.310 --> 28:17.716
Okay, thanks.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.228
Dinner at 8:00 with your parents.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.704
Have fun.

28:21.824 --> 28:24.107
I was thinking of having
sex with you at 8:00,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.384
but if you want to go to dinner... 

28:25.421 --> 28:27.198
I'll just take care of things myself.

28:27.235 --> 28:28.443
Well, that's an interesting threat.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.158
It's a win/win situation for me.

28:30.765 --> 28:32.704
I forgot to tell you that I had called them

28:32.742 --> 28:34.369
and said we'd like to
discuss something with them.

28:34.857 --> 28:36.902
Without asking me about
having dinner with them first?

28:36.940 --> 28:38.979
Yeah, I called them when
you were at lunch with Grace.

28:39.004 --> 28:41.707
I don't think they should
weigh in on the decision,

28:41.827 --> 28:43.027
it's none of their business.

28:43.233 --> 28:45.393
- But it's my mother's business?
- Huh?

28:45.606 --> 28:47.652
You had lunch with my mother
and tried to talk to her

28:47.658 --> 28:49.635
about talking to me about
staying here until we get married?

28:49.641 --> 28:51.862
She's a rat. She's isn't
supposed to say anything to you.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.258
- She's my mother.
- Well.

28:53.301 --> 28:54.021
Well?

28:54.052 --> 28:56.086
All right. We'll have
dinner with my parents.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.713
That wasn't your dad on the phone,

28:57.775 --> 28:59.352
and I was just trying to make a point.

28:59.352 --> 29:01.085
But maybe I didn't make it clear.

29:01.205 --> 29:02.599
I'm not happy with you.

29:02.668 --> 29:05.546
I don't like that you lie to me
or that you try to use my mother.

29:07.341 --> 29:09.650
Well, that's just because
your mother agrees with me!

29:10.588 --> 29:11.883
You going to marry him?

29:12.159 --> 29:13.760
- Ricky?
- Yes, Ricky.

29:13.754 --> 29:17.501
Yeah, yeah, we're planning
on getting married.

29:17.621 --> 29:20.085
Of course, it would help if
I could find my wedding rings.

29:20.135 --> 29:22.081
Yeah, they'll turn up.

29:22.201 --> 29:25.985
I lose everything. I lost my
engagement ring once before.

29:26.023 --> 29:29.001
And I lost my purse with
a bunch of cash in it once.

29:29.121 --> 29:30.353
I don't know why I do that.

29:30.397 --> 29:32.962
Hey Amy, you're going to high school,

29:33.218 --> 29:34.782
you're working after school

29:34.795 --> 29:36.065
and you're raising a three-year-old.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.360
I think it's understandable

29:37.366 --> 29:39.468
if you might misplace things now and then.

29:39.475 --> 29:42.366
Yeah, I know, but... 

29:42.910 --> 29:45.031
it was Margaret's mother's wedding band.

29:45.025 --> 29:47.846
- She gave us her parents' wedding bands.
- Oh.

29:48.359 --> 29:49.604
Do you think it would be horrible

29:49.629 --> 29:51.068
if I went to school in New York?

29:51.188 --> 29:53.527
I don't know. Not if
you're going for the school.

29:54.672 --> 29:57.125
But not if you're just running away.

29:57.169 --> 29:58.658
Or running to someone.

29:58.952 --> 30:00.822
You're not going for Ben, are you?

30:00.885 --> 30:02.756
I didn't realize we had company.

30:02.787 --> 30:04.101
I just have something for Ben

30:04.119 --> 30:05.972
and I just saw him pull up in the driveway.

30:06.529 --> 30:08.593
Wait. Those are mine!

30:10.307 --> 30:12.272
Hello. What's going on?

30:12.392 --> 30:14.349
I knew you had these.

30:15.018 --> 30:17.727
Did you know that he was
pretending to be married to you

30:17.752 --> 30:18.928
when he was sleeping on you?

30:18.972 --> 30:21.043
All right. That's enough. Chloe.

30:25.597 --> 30:28.106
You were pretending to be married
to me and you stole my wedding rings?

30:29.114 --> 30:31.341
Look, they were kind of
falling off your finger

30:31.366 --> 30:33.074
and so I kind of slid them off

30:33.093 --> 30:34.306
and then you moved your hand

30:34.300 --> 30:35.971
and I couldn't put them back on so... 

30:36.033 --> 30:37.729
I put them in my pocket and, yeah... 

30:37.742 --> 30:40.432
Look, I was going to give them back
to you when I saw you earlier today,

30:40.714 --> 30:42.890
but you and Ricky seemed to be
in the middle of something, so... 

30:43.010 --> 30:45.531
Yeah, we were fighting because
I thought I had lost this.

30:45.651 --> 30:48.233
Ben, this is Margaret's
mother's wedding band.

30:48.284 --> 30:49.679
She gave us her parents' wedding bands

30:49.698 --> 30:51.049
and I thought that I lost it.

30:51.169 --> 30:52.194
You stole it?

30:52.314 --> 30:54.177
You're like crazy, do you know that?

30:54.202 --> 30:55.679
No crazier than what you are.

30:55.923 --> 30:57.681
Look, you got what you wanted

30:57.694 --> 31:00.515
and now you don't want it only
you feel too guilty to say so.

31:00.635 --> 31:03.025
But speaking from experience,
all I can tell you is

31:03.012 --> 31:06.235
do not marry someone you're
not madly in love with.

31:06.716 --> 31:08.699
Ricky's the nice guy now,

31:08.819 --> 31:10.426
and it's hard to tell a nice guy no,

31:10.432 --> 31:12.253
but nice guys know when they're being used

31:12.253 --> 31:14.149
and if you're not madly in love with Ricky,

31:14.362 --> 31:15.538
you're using him.

31:15.894 --> 31:18.272
So end it nicely while you still can.

31:30.415 --> 31:30.997
Hello?

31:31.117 --> 31:33.794
Did you tell Kathy she
looks like a stripper?

31:33.775 --> 31:36.146
Hi. Are you back from France?

31:36.296 --> 31:37.035
Did you?

31:37.155 --> 31:38.699
Did Kathy tell you that I trapped Don?

31:38.699 --> 31:39.875
His father did.

31:39.900 --> 31:44.449
Did you tell my daughter that
she looks like a stripper or not?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.264
It's kind of a long story, sir

31:46.276 --> 31:47.953
and I know that's one of my weaknesses,

31:47.965 --> 31:50.719
telling long stories and rambling so... 

31:50.944 --> 31:51.607
Yes.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.359
What the hell is wrong with you, son?

31:53.359 --> 31:55.774
I thought she wanted me to tell
her she looks like a stripper,

31:55.894 --> 31:59.031
because I had said that this
other woman looks like a stripper

31:59.059 --> 32:01.243
and the other woman who looks like
a stripper is also good at math,

32:01.230 --> 32:02.532
better even than Kathy,

32:02.563 --> 32:05.972
but she's old, she's like
thirty, but good looking,

32:06.529 --> 32:09.194
and Kathy got a little
jealous so I said it.

32:09.213 --> 32:11.409
Yeah, I said she looks like a stripper,

32:11.431 --> 32:13.579
meaning that she's good looking. And fit.

32:13.573 --> 32:15.335
And healthy. And has a nice figure.

32:16.207 --> 32:17.496
Hey!

32:17.540 --> 32:19.279
Kathy called me.

32:21.381 --> 32:22.601
Did someone hit you?

32:22.632 --> 32:25.356
- Yes. My foster mother.
- Good.

32:26.451 --> 32:28.281
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

32:30.906 --> 32:34.341
Hi, Jack's mother.

32:34.461 --> 32:37.594
You can never remember my name.

32:37.714 --> 32:40.416
No, no. I can. It's Mrs. Stone.

32:41.698 --> 32:44.113
I just wanted to drop off Jack's laundry.

32:44.233 --> 32:45.852
My mom usually does his laundry.

32:45.972 --> 32:47.786
He likes how I do his laundry better.

32:48.004 --> 32:50.400
And I wanted to confront you.

32:50.706 --> 32:51.739
Confront?

32:51.745 --> 32:53.629
- I know what you're doing.
- What am I doing?

32:53.654 --> 32:55.887
You're trying to find a
way to break up with Jack.

32:55.931 --> 32:57.401
No. Where'd you get an idea like that?

32:57.457 --> 32:59.361
You're looking at colleges out of state?

32:59.372 --> 33:00.561
Yeah, but... 

33:00.623 --> 33:02.338
I don't know where I'm
going to go to college yet,

33:02.363 --> 33:04.108
and even if I did go
to college out of state,

33:04.127 --> 33:05.128
Jack and I wouldn't break up.

33:05.147 --> 33:07.793
I think you know exactly
where you're going to go

33:07.850 --> 33:09.320
and it's out of state.

33:09.491 --> 33:11.209
And you're going to go out of state

33:11.253 --> 33:12.911
just because you can't tell Jack

33:12.949 --> 33:14.319
that you don't want him anymore.

33:14.338 --> 33:15.596
No. That's not true.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.999
My son almost died.

33:19.988 --> 33:22.991
He had his bones broken
and his head smashed in

33:23.111 --> 33:25.694
and now you're going to
stomp all over his heart?

33:26.408 --> 33:27.322
I don't think so.

33:27.358 --> 33:29.148
No, I'm not... I'm not gonna do that.

33:29.185 --> 33:31.889
No. No, you're not.

33:32.289 --> 33:36.168
Because if you do, I might
snap and come after you

33:36.230 --> 33:38.839
because I can't stand the thought

33:39.033 --> 33:40.791
of anyone hurting him again.

33:40.784 --> 33:41.886
I'm not going to hurt him.

33:41.911 --> 33:43.644
I don't like you.

33:43.907 --> 33:45.802
You've never been a
good girlfriend for Jack,

33:45.808 --> 33:48.524
and I don't think you'd
make a good wife for Jack.

33:48.592 --> 33:50.744
"I want to have sex. No,
I don't want to have sex."

33:50.801 --> 33:52.202
"Come over and let's have sex."

33:52.221 --> 33:54.352
"I'm sorry, I changed my mind."

33:54.367 --> 33:55.938
"I'm a Christian, I'm not a Christian."

33:55.957 --> 33:58.941
You can't make up your mind about anything.

33:59.310 --> 34:03.052
And now, after dragging Jack
back into this relationship,

34:03.102 --> 34:05.561
honey, you are not breaking up with him,

34:05.681 --> 34:07.069
not this year

34:07.050 --> 34:09.471
not next year, and not the year after that.

34:09.476 --> 34:12.812
You are not breaking up
with him until I say you are.

34:12.849 --> 34:14.808
Is Reverend Stone with you or... ?

34:14.813 --> 34:15.783
No.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.248
And if you call him

34:18.293 --> 34:20.407
and tell him I said this to you,

34:20.676 --> 34:21.859
I'll deny it,

34:21.889 --> 34:25.411
tell him you're crazy and
he'll just nod in agreement.

34:25.826 --> 34:27.072
Okay.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.492
I hope I didn't scare you,

34:29.612 --> 34:32.150
I'm just protecting my son.

34:32.176 --> 34:34.760
Okay... Mrs. Stone.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.085
Didi.

34:44.752 --> 34:46.156
(EXHALING)

34:54.562 --> 34:57.496
John, I though I told you
to put those cookies down.

34:57.616 --> 34:58.760
John.

35:00.262 --> 35:01.946
Uh, what is that?

35:02.333 --> 35:05.762
That's not that chocolate that I
told you you couldn't have, is it?

35:07.664 --> 35:09.535
The thing about taking
care of a small child is

35:09.535 --> 35:11.005
that you have to be physically active.

35:11.005 --> 35:12.669
You can't just lie on the couch

35:12.688 --> 35:14.665
and read magazines, shouting orders.

35:14.703 --> 35:16.636
We're not reading magazines.

35:17.061 --> 35:18.225
We got tired.

35:18.256 --> 35:21.003
Amy said an hour or two,
she's been gone all day.

35:21.022 --> 35:23.004
Okay well, you can go now, I've got it.

35:23.124 --> 35:25.551
No, we're not going to
leave you with this mess,

35:25.538 --> 35:26.658
we're going to help you clean up.

35:26.721 --> 35:29.347
All right, I'll get the cleaning
supplies and the vacuum cleaner

35:29.379 --> 35:30.987
and you can help me clean up.

35:34.684 --> 35:37.287
Why did you say that? We
were almost out of here.

35:37.331 --> 35:39.489
I didn't think he was actually
going to let us clean up.

35:39.551 --> 35:42.373
I mean, we already took care
of a three-year-old all day.

35:42.429 --> 35:45.426
Yeah, if I were Amy, I would
go to school in New York.

35:45.426 --> 35:47.209
Yeah, I mean he's cute,

35:47.216 --> 35:49.392
but I'd leave him here with Ricky.

35:49.512 --> 35:51.287
A boy needs his father.

35:55.581 --> 35:57.677
I would be more than happy
to stay here with John

35:57.689 --> 35:59.378
while Amy goes to school in New York,

35:59.403 --> 36:00.786
if that's what Amy wants to do.

36:00.906 --> 36:02.394
I love Amy.

36:02.514 --> 36:03.670
And I want to be married to Amy.

36:03.658 --> 36:04.859
Any time she wants to get married.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.961
Now. Later. Whenever.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.337
- Aw!
- Aw!

36:09.708 --> 36:11.466
I don't even know if she likes me.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.938
I know. I don't know
what's going on with her.

36:15.451 --> 36:17.741
I think she feels trapped.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.255
No, that's all right, tell me.

36:19.318 --> 36:21.395
- I don't know what to do.
- I don't know either.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.879
But I don't think she
should go to New York,

36:23.999 --> 36:26.043
I think that's kind of selfish.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.046
But maybe when you're both out of college

36:29.090 --> 36:32.241
and John is a little older and in school,

36:32.293 --> 36:35.321
and if Mr. Boykewich
has a job for you there,

36:35.353 --> 36:36.923
then you could go. But... 

36:37.549 --> 36:40.664
splitting up and leaving
John with one of you,

36:41.008 --> 36:41.922
I don't know.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.905
You think she just doesn't
want to be married to me?

36:44.025 --> 36:46.551
I mean, she went with me
to get married and now... 

36:47.144 --> 36:48.929
(SIGHS) I don't think
she wants to get married.

36:48.935 --> 36:50.530
We're supposed to get married this summer,

36:50.574 --> 36:52.132
when school is out, but... 

36:52.401 --> 36:53.434
I'm not going to push her.

36:53.471 --> 36:54.766
No, don't push her.

36:54.886 --> 36:55.705
No.

36:55.899 --> 36:56.743
So... 

36:56.756 --> 37:00.460
Why would you marry her other
than she's John's mother?

37:00.498 --> 37:01.574
Isn't that reason enough?

37:01.580 --> 37:02.588
Are you in love with her?

37:02.607 --> 37:03.395
I love her.

37:03.408 --> 37:05.591
- Well, is the sex okay?
- Madison!

37:05.835 --> 37:07.310
Well, she won't tell us.

37:07.374 --> 37:10.665
Then I'm not going to
either, but yes, it is.

37:10.690 --> 37:13.562
So you love her but you're
not in love with her?

37:13.593 --> 37:14.738
I don't know what that means.

37:14.782 --> 37:16.319
Isn't it enough that I love her?

37:16.327 --> 37:18.142
Is it enough for you?

37:19.011 --> 37:20.025
Hey.

37:20.250 --> 37:23.397
Sorry, so sorry.

37:23.466 --> 37:25.262
After I went over to my dad's house,

37:25.287 --> 37:27.796
I just needed some time to myself and... 

37:28.572 --> 37:30.818
Whoa. What happened in here?

37:31.454 --> 37:33.515
Your friends are very active babysitters.

37:33.572 --> 37:34.460
And lenient.

37:34.529 --> 37:35.987
I'll clean it up.

37:36.181 --> 37:38.261
Oh, no, no. We'll clean it up.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.245
- Bye.
- Bye.

37:44.476 --> 37:45.590
Bye.

37:52.253 --> 37:53.792
I found them.

37:55.137 --> 37:58.090
So, let's set a date.

38:02.226 --> 38:04.046
You really think I could be a stripper?

38:04.068 --> 38:06.430
If I answer that question, are
you going to call your dad again?

38:06.550 --> 38:07.531
No.

38:07.538 --> 38:09.702
Then yeah, sure. I think you're hot.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.957
- Hotter than Miss Math Books?
- Well, yeah.

38:11.979 --> 38:13.699
I don't know why I got so jealous before.

38:13.736 --> 38:15.257
I kind of like it when you're jealous.

38:15.663 --> 38:17.515
Except for the fact
that you called your dad.

38:18.450 --> 38:20.187
Hey, you think I could be a stripper?

38:20.218 --> 38:21.601
A male stripper?

38:22.187 --> 38:24.592
I wonder how old you have to
be to take off your clothes.

38:25.123 --> 38:26.501
You think they make a lot of money?

38:29.372 --> 38:30.294
I have to go.

38:33.589 --> 38:35.031
I got it.

38:37.605 --> 38:39.244
Well, fancy meeting you here.

38:39.244 --> 38:40.289
Do you have a reservation?

38:40.314 --> 38:42.441
No, but I believe we have an in here.

38:42.472 --> 38:43.921
All right, I'll get you a booth.

38:44.041 --> 38:45.494
I'm still not giving
you twenty grand, toots.

38:45.519 --> 38:47.058
I hear the steaks are pretty good here.

38:47.078 --> 38:48.460
- Enjoy.
- This way.

38:50.181 --> 38:51.369
That's all you can tell me,

38:51.382 --> 38:52.927
is I shouldn't marry the woman I love?

38:52.984 --> 38:54.091
Love another woman.

38:54.118 --> 38:56.181
And by the way, you're
twenty-three years old,

38:56.187 --> 38:57.457
you just got out of college,

38:57.482 --> 38:58.836
you don't have to get married.

38:58.865 --> 39:00.991
- You can wait.
- I'm engaged, Dad.

39:01.025 --> 39:02.706
Eh, people get engaged all the time.

39:02.731 --> 39:06.154
Get unengaged or stay engaged
for 10 years, then decide.

39:06.191 --> 39:08.074
Mom seems to agree with Adrian,

39:08.137 --> 39:09.488
that I should stay here.

39:09.532 --> 39:11.009
Or she wants us to get married first

39:11.036 --> 39:12.336
and then move to New York.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.675
Which would mean, we were
getting married right away.

39:14.675 --> 39:16.396
She's a minister, I'm a cop.

39:16.408 --> 39:18.610
We don't always see things the same way.

39:18.616 --> 39:21.019
Son, go to New York,

39:21.248 --> 39:23.383
do a good job, have a good time.

39:23.408 --> 39:25.598
You are young, enjoy
your life, see the world.

39:25.642 --> 39:27.131
I want to see it with Adrian.

39:27.154 --> 39:28.414
She doesn't want to see it with you.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.896
She wants to stay here and go to school.

39:29.909 --> 39:31.992
She's really smart, she
wants to be an attorney,

39:32.026 --> 39:33.155
practice family law.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.807
Good for her. What do you want to do?

39:34.819 --> 39:36.202
I'm doing what I want to do,

39:36.208 --> 39:38.611
I'm moving to New York and I'm making money

39:38.661 --> 39:40.619
and I'm doing something I find meaningful,

39:40.844 --> 39:42.527
but it won't mean anything to me really,

39:42.565 --> 39:43.747
unless I have someone to share it with.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.118
If the shoe was on the other foot,

39:45.143 --> 39:46.325
would you go to New York with her?

39:46.350 --> 39:47.595
Yeah, definitely.

39:47.633 --> 39:48.753
(CHUCKLING)

39:49.309 --> 39:50.561
What?

39:50.681 --> 39:53.239
I've been in love with you
since the day I first saw you.

39:54.284 --> 39:55.860
We were meant for each other.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.151
I want to live with you

39:58.186 --> 40:00.020
and I want you to have my babies.

40:00.846 --> 40:01.955
(EXHALING)

40:02.761 --> 40:04.262
Would you like fries with that?

40:04.492 --> 40:06.671
(CLEARING THROAT) Yeah.

40:09.336 --> 40:12.684
Well, I asked you to have dinner with me

40:12.703 --> 40:14.010
because, one,

40:14.130 --> 40:18.459
I want to apologize for being
insensitive to your past.

40:18.509 --> 40:19.206
Huh?

40:19.240 --> 40:20.630
I shouldn't have brought up dating.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.408
When?

40:21.443 --> 40:23.070
When you were in my room this morning

40:23.095 --> 40:25.736
losing it because I suggested you
might go out on a date some time?

40:25.856 --> 40:26.993
You know, that whole

40:27.062 --> 40:29.214
screaming and yelling thing that you did?

40:29.218 --> 40:32.924
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. PMS.

40:32.988 --> 40:34.082
What?

40:34.113 --> 40:36.278
I get that way for a
couple of hours every month.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.006
But it's just a couple of hours.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.962
So you're not in the least bit
offended by what I said to you?

40:40.996 --> 40:41.721
No.

40:41.841 --> 40:44.136
All right, secondly,

40:44.366 --> 40:47.102
I'd like to talk to you
about repeating things

40:47.135 --> 40:49.069
that I say to you, back to Dad.

40:49.103 --> 40:50.204
Yeah, why do you do that?

40:50.271 --> 40:51.387
Why do you tell me things

40:51.400 --> 40:52.689
that you don't want him to know?

40:52.809 --> 40:55.541
I can't help but tell him. I love him.

40:55.661 --> 40:56.805
I love Leo.

40:57.145 --> 40:58.551
I have to rat you out. If I didn't,

40:58.582 --> 41:00.433
I would be hiding things
from him that he doesn't know

41:00.416 --> 41:02.767
and I owe it to him to tell him everything.

41:02.773 --> 41:05.101
I'm an only child, so
having a sister is new to me,

41:05.120 --> 41:07.222
but I had thought that one of
the benefits of having a sister

41:07.235 --> 41:09.318
is that I could talk to
you and you could talk to me

41:09.358 --> 41:11.220
and no one would talk to him.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.203
Why? Do you need to talk about Amy?

41:13.229 --> 41:15.468
Yeah, I do. But you can't
repeat what I say back to Dad.

41:15.518 --> 41:16.265
Go ahead.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.334
I think she's finally starting to be Amy.

41:18.368 --> 41:19.779
She's starting to see herself

41:19.816 --> 41:21.299
as someone other than John's mother.

41:21.272 --> 41:23.232
She's becoming her own person.

41:23.241 --> 41:26.042
Which you think will lead
to becoming your own person?

41:26.077 --> 41:26.968
Perhaps.

41:27.155 --> 41:30.258
Didn't I just tell you
you say to your father?

41:30.252 --> 41:31.979
I never learn, that's my problem.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.524
So... 

41:34.084 --> 41:36.703
So, I'm very proud of you.

41:38.456 --> 41:40.056
I love you, George.

41:40.091 --> 41:41.358
And I love you.

41:41.392 --> 41:43.960
So let's stop and make it official.

41:47.465 --> 41:48.808
Hi, Mom.

41:48.928 --> 41:51.849
Please tell me you're not back to ground zero.
