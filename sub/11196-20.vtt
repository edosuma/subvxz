00:06.173 --> 00:08.675
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:10.719 --> 00:12.054
Run!

00:13.889 --> 00:19.311
A requisition just came to me for a C- 5 to
make a classified pick- up at an NID site.

00:21.772 --> 00:24.107
We demand you return
the Touchstone!

00:24.441 --> 00:26.109
It's missing?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.695
They were dressed like you
and carried weapons.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.951
Colonel O'Neill.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.994
Is this a joke, Maybourne?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.580
I think you'll wanna hear
what I have to offer you.

00:39.248 --> 00:40.123
Your mission?

00:40.249 --> 00:43.585
Use any means necessary
to acquire technology to help Earth

00:43.710 --> 00:47.548
in the battle against the Goa'uld
or other unforeseen aggressors.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.009
There's an Asgard ship
over the base!

00:51.760 --> 00:55.514
I'll be holdin' the door open
so you can't go anywhere else.

00:58.016 --> 01:02.229
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to
announce that you are all under arrest

01:02.354 --> 01:06.358
for high crimes against
the United States and its allies.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.874
- How overdue is SG- 9?
- Coming up on 11 hours, sir.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.752
That's not like Major Benton.
Dial P2A- 018.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.755
Try to establish radio contact
from our end.

01:28.881 --> 01:33.218
Sir, my mission report.
Better late than never, I always say.

01:35.971 --> 01:38.015
Chevron one encoded.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.143
Yep. I always say that.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.813
- Chevron two encoded.
- What's goin' on?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.107
SG- 9 was on an extended mission

01:47.232 --> 01:50.569
to re- establish diplomatic relations
with P2A- 018.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.573
018...

01:54.990 --> 01:57.201
- Latona.
- Oh, yes.

01:57.326 --> 02:01.788
One of several planets visited by the NID
while running their offworld programme.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.415
Right.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.792
Major Benton has spent several months

02:05.918 --> 02:09.378
negotiating access to a defensive weapon
they call the Sentinel.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.382
It's said to be capable of
defending their entire planet.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.927
Yeah, I... read the report.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.765
They were scheduled to return
early this morning.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.351
Chevron seven locked.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.898
Standing by, sir. MALP relay is active.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.193
This is Hammond. SG- 9, report.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.114
Major Benton, you are overdue.
Please respond.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.159
General, sir, this is Sergeant Grogan.
Major Benton...

02:40.494 --> 02:42.621
...three days...

02:42.746 --> 02:44.289
The Star...

02:44.414 --> 02:48.627
The Latonans tried to...
but the thing didn't work.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.714
- Can you make it back to the Stargate?
- Negative. There are two Jaffa...

02:52.840 --> 02:54.800
...supported by a staff...

02:54.925 --> 02:57.386
There's no way I can
get back to the Stargate.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.271
- Sergeant, shut it down.
- Yes, sir.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.134
OK, Marul. Go ahead.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.640
Your friends will see me?

04:24.765 --> 04:29.353
Not right now. I'll send
your greeting back with my report.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.148
- What shall I say?
- Anything you like.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.571
How about "hello"?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.381
The rat bastard.

04:57.506 --> 05:02.094
- I thought he came across as very nice.
- The voice behind the camera.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.514
Colonel Sean Grieves,
formerly of the NID.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.933
He led an offworld team
for Colonel Maybourne

05:08.058 --> 05:12.521
and was one of the members of that
organisation convicted of high treason.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.399
And what was Grieves' team
trying to steal?

05:15.524 --> 05:19.486
The Latonans possess a planetary
defence they call the Sentinel,

05:19.611 --> 05:22.781
which has kept them safe
from the Goa'uld for generations.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.617
I can see why the NID would
wanna get their hands on it.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.036
We put'em all away before they could.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.039
Frankly, I'm afraid Colonel Grieves' team

05:31.165 --> 05:35.127
may have done something to the Sentinel
they haven't admitted to.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.922
- Fiddlin' around with it, was he?
- Well, according to his report,

05:39.047 --> 05:42.718
the Latonans never granted
Grieves' team access to the Sentinel,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.637
before they were... recalled and arrested.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.433
You don't think it's possible
for an NID operative to lie?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.810
I believe it is, Daniel Jackson.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.189
Right.

05:55.314 --> 05:59.526
So if Grieves' team disabled
the Latonans only means of self- defence...

05:59.651 --> 06:03.614
- We're responsible.
- Grieves is responsible, thank you.

06:03.739 --> 06:07.951
I doubt the Latonans will appreciate
that distinction, Colonel.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.662
Time will be of the essence.

06:10.787 --> 06:15.334
The Goa'uld forces SG- 9 encountered
on Latona were most likely sent as a test.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.922
- To see if the Sentinel was operational.
- And by now they'll have reported back.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.508
A Goa'uld mothership
most likely is not far off,

06:22.633 --> 06:25.385
if the Goa'uld believe
that Latona may be conquered.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.764
Might be a good time to try that
new guidance system on the UAV.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.933
I think that can be arranged.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.770
Sir, before we go anywhere,
we need to talk to Grieves.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.814
- Why?
- Well, whether we like it or not, sir,

06:37.940 --> 06:43.278
Colonel Grieves and Lieutenant Kershaw
may be the only people qualified to fix it.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.704
I'll go.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.676
You're dismissed.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.055
He's worried I might try to kill you.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.892
In that case, I insist.

07:25.112 --> 07:30.117
Had many visitors lately? Did Maybourne
stop by, see how the old team's doing?

07:30.993 --> 07:35.455
- What do you want, O'Neill?
- P2A- 018.

07:35.581 --> 07:39.251
- A device called the Sentinel.
- What about it?

07:39.376 --> 07:42.796
I need to know what you did to screw it up
and how I can fix it.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.341
I'm more inclined to tell you
where to shove it.

07:48.552 --> 07:53.891
As we speak, SG- 9 is either
pinned down by the Goa'uld or dead,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.018
so let's just cut the crap, OK?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.354
- How is this my problem?
- You're responsible.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.191
018 is defenceless because of you.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.569
Earth is defenceless because of you.
You don't mind that.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.488
You stole technology from our allies.

08:08.614 --> 08:11.033
If I hadn't shut you down,
they would have.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.786
Do you really think the Asgard
or the Tok'ra will rush to our defence

08:14.912 --> 08:18.081
when the Goa'uld finally
decide to stomp on us?

08:18.207 --> 08:21.877
That day is coming, Colonel.
Don't kid yourself.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.759
OK.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.803
I guess I should just
go have a chat with Kershaw.

08:36.390 --> 08:40.145
The Latonans didn't want
to show us the Sentinel.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.773
We found it ourselves
not far from the city.

08:42.898 --> 08:46.193
There was a force field
guarding the device itself.

08:47.027 --> 08:51.823
Kershaw and I took two weeks to get in,
take it apart, and put it back good as new.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.618
Not good as new.
You did something wrong.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.831
Only thing we did wrong was
come back to base to meet our new CO.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.960
It's funny. At the time I was
looking forward to meeting you.

09:03.085 --> 09:06.004
I need you to write down
exactly how you got in,

09:06.129 --> 09:08.882
and exactly what I need to do to fix this.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.802
If I do anything - anything -

09:11.927 --> 09:14.763
I want my sentence commuted.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.932
I think that's understood, goin' in.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.561
And you'll need to take us with you,
Kershaw and me.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.730
- SG-1 can handle it.
- Who do you think you are?

09:23.856 --> 09:26.191
We were good, Colonel.
Just as good as you.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.569
We were acting
for the good of the country.

09:28.694 --> 09:33.407
If you hadn't put me in here, we might
have had our own Sentinel by now.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.700
You done?

09:34.825 --> 09:38.078
I don't care how good Carter thinks she is
or how cocky you are.

09:38.203 --> 09:42.583
The device is way too complicated
for you to try to repair without us.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.462
You already know that,
or you wouldn't be here.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.393
UAV is away, sir. Climbing into position.

10:03.187 --> 10:09.151
Receiving telemetry. Confirm two staff
cannon emplacements 20m from the gate.

10:09.902 --> 10:14.781
We got lucky, sir. The cannons couldn't
down the UAV before it was out of range.

10:14.907 --> 10:18.869
Begin painting the targets
as soon as the UAV reaches altitude.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.663
Close the blast doors. Prepare to launch.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.958
Prepare to launch.

10:34.843 --> 10:39.264
- Target Sierra- 1 has been acquired.
- Sergeant, launch when ready.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.563
Missile away.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.003
Sierra- 1 destroyed.
Attempting to acquire Sierra- 2.

11:10.128 --> 11:14.383
How do you know those are the only
emplacements guarding the gate?

11:14.508 --> 11:17.553
- We don't.
- Sierra- 2 has been acquired by UAV.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.138
Launch when ready.

11:29.898 --> 11:34.111
Sierra- 2 has been destroyed,
but I can't confirm casualties.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.698
UAV switching to recon mode
for stage two.

11:37.823 --> 11:41.326
- That's us.
- Colonel, SG- 3 will take point.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.004
Kershaw.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.466
- Major Lawrence, make it a clean sweep.
- Yes, sir.

11:57.176 --> 12:00.012
Why don't you go with'em?
Keep'em out of trouble.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.347
Be on your six in 60 seconds.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.892
SG- 3, let's go, let's go, let's go!

12:06.143 --> 12:09.313
I'll say it again, I don't like
goin' into this unarmed.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.107
And... I don't care.

12:12.191 --> 12:15.611
I feel better knowing an archaeologist
is watching our backs.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.238
Which end do the bullets go in again?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.824
I'd be happy to show you.

12:23.285 --> 12:27.122
Our mission objective is to fix
whatever you screwed up.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.084
If you get any ideas other than that,

12:31.210 --> 12:33.378
I'll shoot you.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.797
Understood?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.634
Yeah.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.802
Move out.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.172
No sign of SG- 3.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.759
SG- 3, this is SG-1 niner. Report.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.897
Three Jaffa warriors survived the attack.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.734
SG- 3 is in pursuit to prevent them
from reporting our arrival.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.445
Major Lawrence suggests we continue on.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.782
Colonel?

13:43.907 --> 13:46.702
You want me to take point
without a weapon?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.955
I want you to point Teal'c
in the right direction.

13:59.548 --> 14:04.094
How many years did you promise
to take off their sentence if they fix this?

14:04.219 --> 14:06.930
Actually, they'll get
a few more years out of this.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.142
- More?
- They were on death row.

14:17.608 --> 14:21.153
How did you find the Sentinel
if the Latonans wouldn't show it to you?

14:21.278 --> 14:23.071
Maybe we're good.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.866
- Bribed the locals?
- You've done your homework.

14:25.991 --> 14:30.537
Major Benton's preliminary report said the
Latonans don't use currency of any kind.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.332
They don't care
about material things.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.876
Everybody's got their price.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.858
- Colonel.
- Grogan.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.820
You all right?

15:06.532 --> 15:10.035
There was a Jaffa patrol
on my six most of the day.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.454
I decided to stop running and fight it out.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.623
- How long ago?
- Last night.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.460
I guess I passed out
and they went right by me.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.296
- They'll be long gone.
- Where's the rest of your team?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.633
Major Benton took a hit in the chest
on our way back to the gate.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.345
Tarkman and Winters were with me
at first, but I'm the only one left.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.514
Here.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.226
This shouldn't happen, sir.
The Latonans have a device...

15:34.351 --> 15:37.396
- We know, Lieutenant.
- We're here to fix it.

15:38.272 --> 15:41.275
Sir, should I tell SG- 3
Grogan's coming back to the gate?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.360
Negative, Major.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.989
Teal'c, how soon should we
expect a mothership here?

15:47.114 --> 15:51.577
Of that I am unsure, O'Neill.
It could be hours, perhaps even days.

15:51.702 --> 15:53.745
Grogan, can you get me into the city?

15:53.871 --> 15:56.081
There are Jaffa patrols all over the place

15:56.206 --> 15:59.042
making sure the Latonans
keep their curfew.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.046
But I can take you
straight to Marul if you want.

16:03.172 --> 16:06.341
- That's a waste of time.
- Why do you say that?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.428
The Sentinel was built centuries ago
by Marul's ancestors.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.098
- He has no clue how to use it.
- None of'em do.

16:14.683 --> 16:18.896
- Look. We're here to help these people.
- What the hell do you think you can do?

16:19.021 --> 16:22.441
Maybe give them another option
other than being wiped out.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.736
- Grogan, are you good to go?
- Mm- hm.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.613
Good.

16:27.738 --> 16:30.782
- Carter, you're in charge.
- Yes, sir.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.994
- Fix it.
- Yes, sir. Good luck, sir.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.334
Let's go.

17:02.648 --> 17:06.068
That's the main road
leading in and out of the city.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.239
You wouldn't happen to know
a back way in there, would you?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.824
Yes, sir. I think I do.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.424
- This is it.
- What is?

17:30.926 --> 17:33.679
You have to know it's there.
We went right by it at first.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.848
All right, you're on.

17:46.275 --> 17:49.528
Major Carter, it would be wise
if we were to guard the entrance.

17:49.653 --> 17:52.948
Absolutely. At least
until the force field's down.

17:58.620 --> 18:02.749
- How long will that take?
- Last time it took just over 48 hours.

18:02.875 --> 18:07.129
Maybe Daniel can help you shave
a couple of days off that estimate.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.433
You're not preparing for
his arrival as I instructed.

18:19.558 --> 18:22.227
Your people ignore the curfew.

18:22.311 --> 18:26.273
- Because they do not understand it.
- It is a simple matter.

18:26.982 --> 18:30.569
Lord Svarog has claimed Latona
as part of his domain.

18:31.403 --> 18:35.365
Your conquest will happen,
as sure as the sun will rise.

18:36.283 --> 18:40.120
Accept that...
and you may live to serve him.

18:40.370 --> 18:43.207
My people have no desire
to serve anyone.

18:43.457 --> 18:47.377
When Svarog rains fire from the sky,
they will beg for his mercy

18:47.503 --> 18:51.131
- And offer him their devotion.
- No, they will not.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.593
They will, when those
around them begin to die.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.597
This is my last warning.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.891
Your Lord Svarog should not come.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.977
The Sentinel will send him away.
You will all be sent away.

19:04.102 --> 19:08.232
So you have said for three days,
yet here I stand.

19:09.775 --> 19:13.987
- The Sentinel is nothing but a legend.
- It is very real.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.282
Then my patrols will find it and destroy it.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.595
- It's all right, Marul. He's a friend.
- From your world?

19:38.720 --> 19:43.058
That's right. He's come all the way
from Earth just to see you.

19:43.183 --> 19:47.729
I'm Colonel Jack O'Neill. We need to talk.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.300
Please don't do that.

20:17.426 --> 20:19.469
It doesn't look much like a weapon.

20:19.595 --> 20:23.557
Why don't you make yourself useful,
Dr Jackson, and go watch the front door?

20:23.682 --> 20:27.519
I'd rather be helping you, but
your approach looks completely random.

20:27.644 --> 20:31.899
The patterns change randomly.
We're trying to keep ahead.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.025
The sounds?

20:33.150 --> 20:36.111
The code to shut off the field
is always changing

20:36.236 --> 20:39.656
relative to the harmonics
between the tones in each pattern.

20:39.781 --> 20:44.578
- How many different patterns are there?
- We've recorded over a hundred.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.789
- Oh. So I should probably...
- Shut up.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.334
Yeah.

20:56.507 --> 20:59.968
Your offer is kind, but not necessary.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.514
I think it is.

21:03.639 --> 21:06.600
The Sentinel has not
failed us in centuries.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.977
It will not fail us now.

21:10.229 --> 21:14.316
- What's taking it so long?
- I've sent a messenger to the Sentinel

21:14.441 --> 21:17.027
to seek the answer to that question.

21:19.363 --> 21:21.490
Perhaps it is waiting.

21:21.615 --> 21:24.743
You will see.
Our enemy will be sent away.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.120
How, exactly?

21:28.163 --> 21:32.793
One moment they are there,
the next they are gone in white light.

21:33.335 --> 21:37.339
- Gone where?
- To the place our ancestors divined.

21:38.006 --> 21:41.260
We are only grateful
that our enemies are gone.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.345
And that's it?

21:43.470 --> 21:46.223
Their civilisation has
technologically regressed.

21:46.348 --> 21:50.602
Nobody knows how anything works,
just so long as it keeps working.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.356
And you've seen this thing working?

21:54.648 --> 21:56.900
Oh, yes. As a child.

21:57.860 --> 22:03.031
An enemy of our people came
in a great ship, but it was sent away.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.617
That's the story we get
from everybody, sir.

22:05.742 --> 22:10.414
Marul, do you remember a team who
came here from Earth two years ago?

22:10.539 --> 22:12.791
Oh, Colonel Grieves, of course.

22:13.458 --> 22:17.671
He asked that he might see the Sentinel
to learn its mysteries,

22:17.796 --> 22:21.884
so that one day your people
might be protected as we are.

22:22.718 --> 22:26.847
But to do that... that would be
against our highest law.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.726
No one may see the Sentinel,
except its Caretaker.

22:31.059 --> 22:34.313
Yeah, well... They did anyway.

22:36.273 --> 22:40.277
They worked at night so no one
would know. Somehow they got in,

22:40.402 --> 22:44.281
they took it apart, put it back together,
but something's wrong.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.743
They're trying to fix it,
but we might be running out of time.

22:47.868 --> 22:51.079
But... what you say cannot be so.

22:51.205 --> 22:56.126
This flame burns to tell us
the Sentinel is watching over us,

22:56.251 --> 22:58.420
and in turn is being watched over.

22:58.670 --> 23:01.340
As long as this flame burns,

23:01.465 --> 23:04.635
we may rest assured
that we are safe from harm.

23:04.760 --> 23:10.098
There's a battalion of Jaffa in your city
right now, just waiting to harm you.

23:10.224 --> 23:14.019
- There is a barrier to the chamber.
- They got past it.

23:14.144 --> 23:17.397
- Colonel Grieves gave me his word.
- He lied.

23:19.191 --> 23:22.402
Yet you speak the truth?

23:23.820 --> 23:26.281
He does, Marul.

23:54.393 --> 23:56.436
Teal'c, come in.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.107
A Jaffa patrol.

24:00.232 --> 24:04.820
I count ten, maybe more.
With luck they'll pass right by us.

24:04.945 --> 24:08.782
It is more likely they followed
our tracks to this location.

24:23.338 --> 24:26.425
- This is impossible.
- We haven't been at it that long.

24:26.550 --> 24:30.095
- Let me try.
- Do you realise how complicated this is?

24:34.558 --> 24:37.227
It's hit the fan already.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.316
Give me your Beretta.

24:42.441 --> 24:45.194
You think you can help in here?
I can help out there.

25:17.559 --> 25:21.104
We have to take all of them out
so they can't report back.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.489
A Jaffa patrol must have
tracked us here.

25:34.618 --> 25:38.330
We can hold them off for now,
but get that force field down.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.085
Do you know what to listen for?

25:43.210 --> 25:48.757
The progression of the harmonic in each
pattern relative to its spectral equivalent.

26:12.781 --> 26:16.326
My people have depended on
the Sentinel for 300 years.

26:16.702 --> 26:19.454
It was created to be there always,

26:19.580 --> 26:24.251
so that we might feel free to pursue
matters of the mind and spirit,

26:24.376 --> 26:27.254
without fear of what is happening now.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.843
If what you say is true.

26:33.677 --> 26:35.721
I didn't come all this way to lie to you.

26:35.846 --> 26:39.057
- How many will die?
- I don't know.

26:39.183 --> 26:42.436
And I can't undo
what's already been done.

26:42.561 --> 26:45.522
But we can save hundreds
of your people, maybe all of them.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.024
How?

26:47.149 --> 26:50.736
We're prepared to evacuate
as many people as possible.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.447
And military support
to get'em to the gate.

26:53.572 --> 26:56.366
Leave our world...

26:56.492 --> 26:58.702
I'm afraid so.

26:58.827 --> 27:02.623
As we speak, a Goa'uld mothership
could be on its way here.

27:02.748 --> 27:05.083
What will I tell them?

27:05.209 --> 27:08.045
That the very people
who doomed our world

27:08.170 --> 27:11.340
now ask us to trust our lives to them?

27:21.600 --> 27:24.603
I am Svarog.

27:25.437 --> 27:29.775
From this day forth, you will serve me.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.969
That's all of'em I can see.

27:57.094 --> 27:59.263
- What are you doing out here?
- Helpin' you.

27:59.388 --> 28:02.140
- A mothership just fired on the city.
- I saw.

28:02.266 --> 28:05.435
You must get that force field down.
That's why you're here.

28:05.561 --> 28:09.690
Jackson wanted a try, I gave him a try.
You were getting shot at, I backed you up.

28:09.815 --> 28:12.651
Or is it you don't like
the idea of me with a gun?

28:12.776 --> 28:15.070
It's empty.

28:15.404 --> 28:18.073
Get back in there.

28:19.408 --> 28:23.120
Teal'c, I wanna see what's taking so long.
Keep an eye out.

28:27.499 --> 28:29.751
That voice...

28:31.003 --> 28:33.046
All part of the show.

28:34.131 --> 28:37.801
- The sky rained fire.
- It's from a ship in orbit.

28:37.926 --> 28:41.138
One with really big speakers.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.515
Marul! Marul!

28:48.854 --> 28:51.732
Has the messenger returned
with any news?

28:52.733 --> 28:56.945
There are Jaffa patrols everywhere.
I doubt anybody would make it very far.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.323
Go home. Tee h'eta.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.914
Do you have any other way
of defending yourself?

29:13.337 --> 29:16.048
- Carter, come in.
- Yes, sir.

29:16.173 --> 29:20.636
The mothership's here.
Some guy named... Svarog.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.347
He's a System Lord, sir.
You should get out.

29:23.472 --> 29:27.017
- Yeah. What's your progress?
- Still working on the force field.

29:27.142 --> 29:31.855
- Major, people are startin' to die here.
- Yes, sir. We're doing our best.

29:32.689 --> 29:37.319
You tell Grieves, if he doesn't fix
that thing, I'll shoot him anyway.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.701
Marul, you have to
make an announcement.

29:44.827 --> 29:48.038
Tell your people to evacuate the city
and head to the Stargate.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.958
Many of your people could survive.

29:53.335 --> 29:57.172
You've got two options: sit here and
watch your city burn to the ground,

29:57.297 --> 30:00.968
or surrender. You surrender,
they'll enslave your people.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.554
And they'll take some of them as hosts.

30:03.762 --> 30:07.057
The Goa'uld are parasites.
They take over the bodies of people.

30:07.182 --> 30:11.311
My people are innocent.
They have done nothing to deserve this.

30:11.436 --> 30:15.566
I can't stay here much longer.
You've got to make a decision.

30:15.691 --> 30:19.862
But your friends may yet be able
to repair the damage they have done.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.698
This Goa'uld is not gonna wait for that.

30:29.121 --> 30:31.707
It's time to go.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.084
With or without you.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.175
Dammit!

30:41.300 --> 30:45.762
You almost had it. You just had
the last two colours in the wrong order.

30:47.890 --> 30:50.142
- We're in!
- Go!

30:50.267 --> 30:55.606
Colonel, we've made it past the force field
and we're starting to work on the Sentinel.

31:01.862 --> 31:05.032
Warriors of Svarog approach
in greater numbers.

31:05.157 --> 31:08.285
Understood, Teal'c.
We'll make our stand inside the cave.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.996
Keep them at bay as long as you can
and then get in.

31:11.121 --> 31:13.916
Daniel, can you get
that force field working again?

31:14.041 --> 31:16.084
I'm on it.

31:29.723 --> 31:32.184
Incoming transmission!

31:34.311 --> 31:37.022
- It's SG- 3, sir.
- Put it on the speaker.

31:37.940 --> 31:42.236
- This is SG- 3 niner. Come in.
- What's your situation, Major?

31:45.614 --> 31:49.535
Goa'uld forces are headin' toward us.
A battalion supported by gliders.

31:49.660 --> 31:53.956
- Can you hold the Stargate?
- Not without reinforcements, sir.

31:54.081 --> 31:55.582
Understood.

31:55.707 --> 31:58.001
What's the status of SG-1?

31:58.126 --> 32:03.131
They're out of radio range, sir. We've
been out of contact for several hours.

32:03.257 --> 32:07.469
Very well, Major. Hold the Stargate for
as long as you can, then get out of there.

32:07.594 --> 32:12.057
- SG-1 will just have to get the job done.
- Yes, sir. SG- 3 niner out.

32:15.310 --> 32:19.940
- I'm sure they'll find a way, sir.
- It's not SG-1 I'm worried about.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.735
Colonel Grieves?

32:23.861 --> 32:27.990
While stealing a powerful beam weapon
from the people of P3Y- 294,

32:28.115 --> 32:33.537
Colonel Grieves turned the device
against his pursuers, killing all three.

32:33.662 --> 32:38.917
We returned the weapon, but P3Y- 294
would have nothing further to do with us.

32:40.711 --> 32:42.963
I'll be in my office, Sergeant.

32:43.714 --> 32:45.757
Yes, sir.

32:57.394 --> 33:00.898
Colonel, you and I know that we left this
exactly the way we found it.

33:01.023 --> 33:05.152
- We can't have. We missed something.
- We didn't. It must be something else.

33:05.277 --> 33:09.114
Either shut up or go help Jackson
get the force field back on.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.845
- How many?
- Several gliders, a battalion of warriors.

33:31.970 --> 33:34.723
You wanna be on this side
when we get this up again.

33:34.848 --> 33:37.100
Just tell us when.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.940
Go. Save yourselves.

33:43.857 --> 33:46.568
I will remain here
as long as this flame burns.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.487
Marul...

33:48.612 --> 33:51.824
As long is it burns, the Caretaker lives.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.826
What Caretaker?

33:53.951 --> 33:57.496
He is not to be spoken of.
It is against our law.

33:57.621 --> 34:01.375
Look, do you want
your people to survive or not?

34:06.380 --> 34:09.466
- I'm almost outta ammo!
- OK, get on this side.

34:19.141 --> 34:22.062
- Daniel!
- If you could stop shooting for a second.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.438
I got it. Go, go, go, go.

34:27.192 --> 34:29.360
Kershaw.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.998
It's gonna be all right.
They can't get past the force field.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.210
Colonel.

34:58.724 --> 35:00.517
Carter.

35:01.268 --> 35:03.687
Carter, if you can hear me,

35:03.812 --> 35:07.608
we've got to find
someone called the Caretaker.

35:07.733 --> 35:12.738
He's like a hermit. He lives near the
Sentinel and apparently takes care of it.

35:27.794 --> 35:30.923
One of my patrols
has discovered your Sentinel.

35:31.048 --> 35:34.426
Even now, warriors of the Tauri
endeavour to repair it.

35:35.761 --> 35:38.055
I cannot allow them to succeed.

35:42.392 --> 35:45.562
Tell me how to disable the force field.

35:45.687 --> 35:48.106
That would be against our highest law.

35:50.776 --> 35:54.071
You would sacrifice
your own life to defy me?

35:55.364 --> 35:57.616
I would.

36:08.585 --> 36:10.838
Colonel O'Neill, come in.

36:14.007 --> 36:17.010
Force field must be
blocking the radio signal.

36:18.595 --> 36:20.973
We put it back the way it was.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.935
- I know we did.
- Obviously we didn't.

36:27.396 --> 36:30.315
If Colonel Grieves can
get it working, I'll tell you.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.819
Wait a second. I think
I recognise some of these symbols.

36:33.944 --> 36:37.406
Their written language is similar
to the people of P2A- 463.

36:37.531 --> 36:41.118
- So?
- So it's possible they're related.

36:41.243 --> 36:43.370
Don't tell me you could read that.

36:43.495 --> 36:46.957
No, I'm just saying I recognise
some of these symbols.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.753
On P2A- 463, these symbols mean
"life force","life energy".

36:51.879 --> 36:53.463
Life energy?

36:53.589 --> 36:56.925
- These ones mean "two as one".
- And that means?

36:57.050 --> 37:01.930
I have no idea, but it means something
or they wouldn't have written it here.

37:02.055 --> 37:04.391
- The Caretaker, Colonel.
- Shut up!

37:04.516 --> 37:07.352
What if the device is only
part of the equation?

37:07.477 --> 37:11.773
- You're guessing.
- We both know nothing's wrong with it.

37:11.899 --> 37:14.151
We put it back the way it was.

37:15.444 --> 37:21.116
What if the Caretaker did more
than just look after it?

37:21.241 --> 37:23.285
Tell us of this Caretaker.

37:23.410 --> 37:27.581
The night we found this place,
a Latonan man took us by surprise.

37:28.457 --> 37:31.210
- What happened?
- He attacked us. I defended myself.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.357
Colonel, look out!

38:08.413 --> 38:13.252
My orders were to retrieve technology to
save Earth from the Goa'uld at all costs.

38:13.377 --> 38:16.797
- You killed him.
- I defended myself!

38:19.758 --> 38:23.637
We should have taken him into the city.

38:24.930 --> 38:27.933
They could have saved him.
I know they could have.

38:28.058 --> 38:31.228
The Caretaker... he begged us to.

38:32.062 --> 38:34.106
Please.

38:35.482 --> 38:38.193
Please. I do not wish to die.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.613
Colonel, maybe we can
take him back to the city.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.408
- Yes, the city...
- That's not an option.

38:44.533 --> 38:47.369
But, sir, he'll die if we just leave him here.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.666
We have our orders, Kershaw.

38:52.791 --> 38:55.794
- Then allow me to touch the Sentinel.
- Why?

38:55.919 --> 38:58.964
- Shut him up.
- Please...

38:59.089 --> 39:02.384
Allow me to touch the Sentinel
just once with my hand.

39:03.552 --> 39:07.264
- You're not touching anything.
- This is wrong.

39:07.389 --> 39:11.101
It's his own damn fault
for sneaking up on me like that.

39:11.226 --> 39:15.105
You've gotta think of the big picture here.
The Sentinel could save Earth.

39:15.230 --> 39:18.984
We're talking about one life- one life -
compared to billions of people.

39:19.109 --> 39:22.613
- We don't even know how it works.
- We'll find out.

39:23.405 --> 39:27.159
Will you allow me to give him
something for the pain, then, sir?

39:27.284 --> 39:29.953
Fine, but that's all we can do.

39:34.124 --> 39:36.585
When I die,

39:37.794 --> 39:40.172
Marul will know.

39:40.297 --> 39:42.841
What do you mean, he'll know?

39:43.717 --> 39:48.639
He told us that, if he were to die,
the Latonans would know anyway.

39:48.931 --> 39:50.057
How so?

39:50.182 --> 39:53.977
A flame in Marul's chamber
would die with him.

39:54.811 --> 39:58.649
He... wore a band around his wrist.

39:58.774 --> 40:01.276
It was a dead man's switch.

40:04.488 --> 40:07.241
I rigged it so nobody
would know he was gone.

40:08.158 --> 40:10.744
Two forces as one, man and machine.

40:10.869 --> 40:13.080
No, no! We missed something.

40:13.205 --> 40:15.541
We just need to find out what it is.

40:32.266 --> 40:33.392
Colonel.

40:33.517 --> 40:36.979
You know, now would be
a good time to turn that thing on.

40:38.438 --> 40:41.900
Lower the force field,
or your friends will be killed.

40:42.818 --> 40:46.071
- Sir...
- Don't do it, Carter. That's an order.

40:46.947 --> 40:48.699
Jaffa.

40:49.074 --> 40:50.576
Agh!

40:53.871 --> 40:56.456
- Blow it up! Don't let'em have it.
- Jaffa.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.919
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

41:01.044 --> 41:04.047
Wait! I can deactivate the force field.

41:15.559 --> 41:17.936
I can do it from here.

41:21.523 --> 41:24.693
I'm gonna let Colonel Grieves
take down the force field, sir.

41:24.818 --> 41:27.529
Carter, I gave you a direct order.

41:27.863 --> 41:30.532
Yes, sir. I understand that.

41:31.533 --> 41:33.744
I think it's the right thing to do.

42:08.570 --> 42:12.241
- He's gone.
- As are the Jaffa.

42:26.588 --> 42:28.215
What just happened?

42:28.340 --> 42:32.469
The Sentinel was never damaged, sir.
It just required a human component.

42:32.594 --> 42:36.473
Man and machine working together
to become a weapon.

42:36.598 --> 42:39.852
The Sentinel is indeed
a device of great power.

42:39.977 --> 42:44.022
We would be wise to ask the Latonans
if we may study it further.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.361
Oh, I think I know what they'd say.
