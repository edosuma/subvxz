Hi, everyone.
I'm Bart Simpson,

07:27.247 --> 07:28.680
the creator of<i> Angry Dad.</i>

07:28.682 --> 07:32.517
To make this film, I had to miss
countless hours of school.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.119
And there was also
some hardship.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.022
I hope you like it
as much as I do.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.760
<i>...The Movie!</i>

07:43.597 --> 07:45.897
What did they think?
Well, let's not
jump to conclusions.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.901
We'll look at the tape of the
audience watching the movie.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.904
(laughter, whistling)

For God's sake, turn it off!
Turn it off!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.048
(dejected):
Oh.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.850
Don't feel bad, boy.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.551
Everyone makes mistakes.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.220
Yours is just public
and expensive.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.889
You know, your movie's
not all bad.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.891
If you cut out the stuff
that didn't work,

08:12.893 --> 08:15.560
it would make a great
short film.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.528
A short film?!

08:16.530 --> 08:17.596
Many great directors

08:17.598 --> 08:19.764

Frank Tashlin

08:19.766 --> 08:22.100
