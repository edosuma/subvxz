WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.481
Previously onDynasty...What if I can never see again?

00:03.525 --> 00:04.961
Nadia, the nurse we spoke about.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.832
I don't need you,
so you're dismissed.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.530
The judge has agreed to
grant bail on the condition

00:08.573 --> 00:09.835
of house arrest. BLAKE:
I'm not gonna be much help

00:09.879 --> 00:11.881
to you if I'm in prison
for murder.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.622
If Jeff finds out
you're my stepdaughter...

00:13.665 --> 00:15.276
I won't tell anyone who I am.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.495
What are we gonna do? We're
supposed to have entertainment.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.019
Hello, everyone!
I'm Vanessa.

00:19.062 --> 00:19.845
Hey!

00:20.542 --> 00:21.499
You okay?Yeah.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.805
So, how's your fiancé?

00:22.848 --> 00:23.893
Nonexistent. Femperial

00:23.936 --> 00:26.504
is my company,
and I want it back.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.767
Is Liam's amnesia contagious
or have you just lost your mind?

00:28.811 --> 00:29.942
I love you, Liam,

00:29.986 --> 00:31.640
but I'm really moving on
this time.

00:35.078 --> 00:38.734
♪ You know, you know,
you know that I want you ♪

00:38.777 --> 00:42.477
♪ I don't, I don't,
I don't really want to ♪

00:42.520 --> 00:45.175
♪ I know, I know, I know

00:45.219 --> 00:48.178
♪ You always knew

00:48.222 --> 00:51.877
♪ You know, you know,
you know that I want you ♪

00:51.921 --> 00:55.533
♪ I don't, I don't,
I don't really want to ♪

00:55.577 --> 00:58.710
♪ I know, I know, I know

00:58.754 --> 01:00.756
♪ You always knew.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.020
MONICA:
New York was New York.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.413
Same as always.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.893
I am thinking about
opening a Club Colby there.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.374
Anyway, I want to
know about Evan Tate.

01:10.418 --> 01:13.116
Where is he on a scale
of boy toy to bae?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.075
Evan is strictly a rebound.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.902
Every rebound you've
had since junior high

01:16.946 --> 01:19.209
has involved peach schnapps
and lacrosse players.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.863
And since I don't
see either of those,

01:20.906 --> 01:22.865
I'm thinking you like him.

01:22.908 --> 01:25.650
Uh... maybe I like him.
A little bit.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.697
But I am removing the other
"L" word from my vocabulary.

01:28.740 --> 01:29.915
"Love" or "Liam"?

01:29.959 --> 01:31.743
Both. I need to work
on forgetting Liam,

01:31.787 --> 01:32.962
which is ironic.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.964
So, yeah,
Evan and I are just having fun.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.618
Mm. Classic denial.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.707
It's good that you're
distracting yourself.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.317
Wait, who's in denial?

01:40.361 --> 01:43.146
You. It doesn't matter
how much fun you have with Evan.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.408
You are not over Liam.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.106
You'll always
love him.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.542
Whitney Houston style.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.587
Hey, we are not focusing
on the "L" words, remember?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.111
We are focusing on work.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.416
Speaking of,

01:52.460 --> 01:55.245
Evan is also helping me
with my media company,

01:55.289 --> 01:57.117
which I am renaming...

01:57.160 --> 01:58.596
Fallon Unlimited.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.945
Right. The name
of the fake company

01:59.989 --> 02:01.208
that you launched last year.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.210
Yes, exactly.
But, this time, it's real.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.212
And the first thing I am doing
is remaking

02:05.255 --> 02:07.127
the company's
misogynistic men's magazine

02:07.170 --> 02:08.476
into a lifestyle monthly.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.347
You know, less phallic,
more Fallon.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.306
Think Obut less Oprah.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.090
So, basically, more Fallon.Yes.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.526
Good morning, ladies.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.006
How's business?

02:17.049 --> 02:19.748
You are still
co-owners

02:19.791 --> 02:22.229
of Broken Glass
Recording Artists, right?

02:22.272 --> 02:24.318
'Cause I thought
you might be

02:24.361 --> 02:27.016
interested in
actually doing some business.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.278
Uh...

02:28.322 --> 02:31.629
signing my latest
musical recording ingenue,

02:31.673 --> 02:33.979
Vanessa, before someone else
snaps her up.

02:34.023 --> 02:37.940
You manage the girl
from the hotel's opening?

02:37.983 --> 02:39.202
Sure do.
And if you're interested,

02:39.246 --> 02:40.377
I can make it happen.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.512
Well, I mean,
she's worth auditioning,

02:44.555 --> 02:46.209
if we're going
to revive the label,

02:46.253 --> 02:47.384
which we kind of should,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.343
because I am
in an empire-building mode.

02:49.386 --> 02:52.302
Okay, but we are not renaming
the label Fallon Unlimited.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.477
We can discuss it.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.610
BLAKE:
Forget about it, Mitchell.

02:55.653 --> 02:58.787
I'm putting plan B into action.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.833
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
about it on the phone, am I?

03:01.877 --> 03:04.314
I'm guessing the change of venue
didn't happen.

03:04.358 --> 03:05.924
You know, Mitchell's survey
shows that 89%

03:05.968 --> 03:09.406
of Atlanta residents polled
have an unfavorable association

03:09.450 --> 03:11.626
with the name
"Blake Carrington."

03:11.669 --> 03:13.367
And that wasn't enough
to sway the judge?No.

03:13.410 --> 03:16.500
I just paid good money
to find out that people hate me.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.676
But not enough to help my case.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.504
Well, the jury
will be sequestered,

03:20.548 --> 03:23.246
so hopefully they won't see
any more negative press.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.421
Which brings us to plan B.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.815
Right.
But I'm the one who's going.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.469
No, that is not
what we discussed.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.079
And I don't think I like it.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.559
You're under house arrest.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.735
And we're talking about
a civil servant,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.519
not a violent criminal.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.738
He's willing to help us.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.435
He's obviously not
the cleanest guy around.

03:38.479 --> 03:41.395
Look, I know if Anders
were here, you'd send him.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.918
But he's not.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.528
So, I'm the next best thing.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.357
I just don't want you
to end up on trial, too.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.619
I won't.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.534
I can handle it, Blake.

03:55.496 --> 03:58.281
Wow. He must be here for that
Synergy Horizons convention,

03:58.325 --> 04:00.544
'cause, uh, I can feel
the synergy from here,

04:00.588 --> 04:02.372
if you know what I'm saying.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.548
Hello? Is anyone home?

04:04.592 --> 04:06.246
Because an incredibly hot guy
just walked by,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.073
and you have your head
buried in ketchup.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.772
I have to finalize
the late-night bar menu.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.469
Don't you have people
that can do this for you?

04:12.513 --> 04:15.167
Yes, I do. But this
place is my baby.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.430
Blah, blah, blah.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.953
You are missing opportunities
left and right.

04:17.996 --> 04:20.172
When was the last time
you even kissed a guy?

04:21.957 --> 04:24.786
Okay, don't project your
lonely girl lifestyle,

04:24.829 --> 04:27.963
lack of a man and
general thirst onto me.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.486
No thirst here, my friend.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.140
I am fully hydrated.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.099
After a jailbird
and a security risk,

04:34.143 --> 04:35.666
I'm taking a break from men.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.451
You know, I even hired
a professional headhunter

04:37.494 --> 04:39.496
to help me find
a female CEO for Femperial.

04:39.540 --> 04:42.020
Why? 'Cause you can't trust
your own instincts there either?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.326
Right.
So I have nothing

04:43.370 --> 04:46.198
but time to help
find someone for you.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.504
I don't need someone, Kirby.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.071
Oh, come on.Mm.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.639
Who can resist a chance
at a little romance?

04:53.075 --> 04:55.338
Okay.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.819
You're right.
Maybe I could use some fun.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.473
Okay.

04:59.516 --> 05:00.865
EVAN:
Bad news.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.998
The name "Fallon Unlimited"
is apparently owned

05:03.041 --> 05:03.999
by someone already.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.348
What?

05:05.392 --> 05:06.610
But that's impossible.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.090
I'm holding
a press conference today

05:08.133 --> 05:10.571
to announce the company
and magazine rebrand.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.355
I need the rights
secured by then.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.357
I mean, the whole thing
is centered around the name.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.576
I'm on it.
All right?

05:15.619 --> 05:17.012
It's probably some old lady
named Fallon

05:17.055 --> 05:18.796
who knits holiday sweaters.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.495
Creating an attractive offer
sheet shouldn't be a problem.Okay.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.714
Well, good, because the magazine
is the first company asset

05:23.758 --> 05:25.194
that I'm putting
my own stamp on,

05:25.237 --> 05:27.065
and I don't want it
to be the last.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.459
Since we're talking deals,

05:29.503 --> 05:31.505
I've got another offer for you.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.899
I'm having dinner
with my mom tonight

05:34.943 --> 05:37.511
and was thinking
maybe you'd want to come along.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.382
Do you hate your mom that much?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.123
I mean, do you not remember
what happened

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
the last time I saw her?

05:42.603 --> 05:44.692
I've got meds and a masseuse
standing by.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.520
Yeah, I want you guys
to get along.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.696
And I didn't want her
to find out for the first time

05:48.739 --> 05:51.873
by accident that you and me
were dating and flip out.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.048
What do you think?

05:53.091 --> 05:55.877
You know what?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.705
Let's do it.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.536
An apple.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.494
Yeah.
You're doing great.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.496
Now, just remember, when
you're feeling your way around

06:06.540 --> 06:08.150
without the cane,
keep your fingers bent more

06:08.193 --> 06:10.500
so you don't snag a nail
or cut yourself.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.806
Well, a little more
pain won't matter.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.938
Oh, I didn't realize
this was a pity party.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.505
What's the occasion?

06:15.549 --> 06:19.074
I'm having trouble adjusting
to my new role in the family.

06:20.684 --> 06:23.426
They won't even let me help
with my father's defense.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.297
I know it can be
a very emotional time.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.909
Most of my patients
feel pretty lost,

06:27.952 --> 06:29.519
end up with
some serious trust issues.

06:29.563 --> 06:32.435
Well, that's nothing new,
especially with Fallon always...

06:32.479 --> 06:33.741
having it out for me.

06:33.784 --> 06:37.222
But... now my stepmother
is following her lead,

06:37.266 --> 06:38.789
and she's trying to
poison me against Blake.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.443
If there's any way I can help...

06:40.487 --> 06:42.358
How can you help me with that?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.925
And why would you want to?

06:43.968 --> 06:45.100
Because I know you.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.188
You've been hurt
a thousand times.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.798
That's why
you don't trust people.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.104
And I know,

06:49.147 --> 06:51.585
because I have the same scars.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.851
Why should I trust you?

06:56.894 --> 06:58.766
You shouldn't.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.942
Not yet.

07:00.985 --> 07:05.250
But you'll see
that you can.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.122
Bottomless mimosas
ended with brunch.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.950
But since I owe
you a drink,

07:08.993 --> 07:10.430
anything you want's
on the house.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.344
Tempting, but I just
came to check on you

07:12.388 --> 07:14.477
after our little I, Tonyascare.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.436
Don't worry.
There's not a scratch on me.

07:16.479 --> 07:19.482
And I don't scare easy, FYI.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.092
Good to know.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.617
Now, one of my sources tells me
that you're new to the city.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.315
So I thought I'd offer
my services as your on-call

07:26.358 --> 07:27.795
Atlanta tour guide.

07:27.838 --> 07:28.839
Give me your phone.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.500
That is my number.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.893
Use it at will.

07:38.936 --> 07:40.547
Oh, I absolutely will.

07:46.030 --> 07:48.163
You know those come out
of my paycheck, right?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.556
Don't be stingy.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.166
With the drinks or the gossip.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.298
What were you talking
to Michael Culhane about?

07:53.342 --> 07:55.736
Oh, just some light flirting
with the guy who saved my life.

07:55.779 --> 07:56.737
No biggie.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.086
I see you inherited my taste.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.174
Tall, dark, handsome

07:59.217 --> 08:00.392
and the owner

08:00.436 --> 08:03.483
of a multimillion-dollar
sports franchise.

08:03.526 --> 08:05.485
He's all over the gossip sites.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.921
I don't need his bio.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.923
He'd be the perfect partner
in a power couple.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.446
You could date
for a few weeks,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.666
establish yourself
on the social scene,

08:12.709 --> 08:14.842
and then use it
to help your music launch.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.800
Do you have to turn everything
in my life

08:16.844 --> 08:18.367
into part of your master plan?

08:18.410 --> 08:20.151
Uh, yeah. That's my job.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.023
Look, if I'm gonna be hanging
out with Michael Culhane,

08:22.066 --> 08:23.720
it's gonna be
because I like him.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.200
Perfect.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.246
Then we can both get
what we want out of this.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.729
Knock, knock.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.211
You're fine. You're fine.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.213
You've moved on.
You've moved on.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.389
Uh, your publisher's office
moved,

08:40.432 --> 08:43.566
probably to some crowded
coffee shop with free Wi-Fi.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.133
This isn't about work, Fallon.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.395
This is about us.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.571
I didn't know there was an us.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.138
Look, I don't know
what there is.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.575
All I know is that my memories
are starting to come back,

08:52.619 --> 08:54.011
and I really just...

08:55.317 --> 08:58.233
I think talking to you
might help me remember more.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.408
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize

08:59.451 --> 09:01.105
I was your on-call
memory technician.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.890
I get that playing
"guess that recollection"

09:02.933 --> 09:05.240
might be fun for you,
but it's not easy for me.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.850
And it's definitely not fair.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.331
I understand, but half of what
Ashley told me is about her

09:09.374 --> 09:10.767
is actually about you.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.247
And I don't know

09:12.290 --> 09:14.554
if there's any other way
for me to clear up what's what.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.207
Why don't you go ask that tramp?

09:16.251 --> 09:17.818
Because I don't trust her.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.994
And she's totally
out of my life now.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.866
Look, um,

09:22.910 --> 09:26.653
I don't think that going down
this road is a good idea,

09:26.696 --> 09:30.439
for me, so I'm going to
have to decline your offer.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.615
I know you're afraid
of being let down again.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.922
And, Fallon,
I get it.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.271
But if there's ever
gonna be a chance

09:36.314 --> 09:37.577
for the two of us in the future,

09:37.620 --> 09:39.230
I need you to go out
with me tonight.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.843
So I'm begging you. Please.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.282
Okay, fine.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.675
One dinner.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.938
But after that,
I am walking away.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.113
Okay.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.636
Okay.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.358
I had no idea
Dominique was a music manager.Mm.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.273
Does she have
a lot of clients?Right now,

10:22.317 --> 10:24.928
she's focused on me, which
is why it sometimes feels

10:24.972 --> 10:27.061
like she's trying to
control my entire life.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
Well, remember
that she works for you,

10:28.976 --> 10:30.325
not the other way around.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.240
You got to stand up for yourself
when you need to.

10:32.283 --> 10:35.243
I know I should, but she can
be a little scary sometimes.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.245
I thought you didn't scare easy.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.073
Well, that mainly applies
to back alley fights.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.859
But I'm glad
you were there.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.818
I'm glad I was there, too.

10:49.126 --> 10:52.260
What's wrong?Uh, a couple paparazzi
just pulled up outside.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.435
Oh. Do they know
who you are?

10:53.478 --> 10:55.350
Yeah, I just got
out of a situation

10:55.393 --> 10:57.091
they covered pretty heavily.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.614
You mean, when you were in jail?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.443
That would be the situation.
Yes.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.054
I'm not one for the spotlight.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.753
My mom's been through enough
heartache since my dad passed.

11:06.796 --> 11:10.104
Don't need her reading another
wild lie about me on Page Six.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.627
Well, we can go if you want.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.762
I do, but you want to have
a little fun while we do it?

11:15.805 --> 11:18.286
Not having my picture taken
might piss some people off

11:18.329 --> 11:20.288
on my end, but let's do it.

11:24.074 --> 11:26.294
♪ Have fun with your baby now

11:26.337 --> 11:28.905
♪ Before the room turns
upside down and hold on tight ♪

Ms. Carrington
will be overjoyed.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.069
Fallon Unlimited is yours.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.811
Oh, yes! See, I knew you
were worth every penny.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.465
Well, you haven't actually
paid me anything yet.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.337
Well, every metaphorical penny.Hmm. Well, now

12:09.380 --> 12:11.469
we have something to celebrate
tonight with my mother.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.038
What?

12:15.082 --> 12:16.648
It'll be fine, I promise.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.476
Look, I really hate to do
this so last minute,

12:18.520 --> 12:20.130
but I can't make it tonight.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.698
We can reschedule;
it's just that

12:22.742 --> 12:24.482
something just came up
that I have to go to.

12:24.526 --> 12:27.311
No, it's fine.
I, uh, I totally get it.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.791
Things happen.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
You, uh, forget
you have an appointment,

12:30.837 --> 12:32.664
your dad's on trial for murder.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.970
The usual issues.

12:34.014 --> 12:36.364
Thank you for understanding.Of course.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.844
We'll talk tomorrow?

12:37.887 --> 12:39.019
Yeah.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.816
KIRBY:
Uh, is the rooftop bar closed?

12:53.860 --> 12:55.557
Because that was only five
minutes, and that's too quick,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.037
even for a midafternoon date.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.690
Yeah, and it was
four minutes too long.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.344
Okay, well, that's not
really giving anyone a chance.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.390
It is when you set me up
on a date

13:02.433 --> 13:03.870
with one of my own employees.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.655
Oh. Yeah, I thought
he looked familiar.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.700
Kirby, that is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.702
Now I won't be able to fire him,

13:10.746 --> 13:12.835
no matter how bad
he is at his job.Okay.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.663
All right, that was
probably my fault.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.056
But you have
to admit,

13:16.099 --> 13:17.579
other than, you know,
the whole employee thing,

13:17.622 --> 13:19.668
Quincy was perfect for you.
I deserve another chance.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.584
Fine, just make sure
to check his W-2, okay?

13:22.627 --> 13:24.586
Absolutely. Wait, what's a W-2?

13:24.629 --> 13:26.240
Oh, my God. Google it.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.592
Do you know who that is?

13:30.635 --> 13:32.899
SAM:
Oh, he's just some guy
that rented one of the, um,

13:32.942 --> 13:34.422
conference rooms.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.598
But he's not my type, so focus.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.643
Mm-hmm.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.259
With a little advertising, we
could make a weekly showcase

13:45.302 --> 13:47.957
at the club into a thing,
like we always wanted.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.872
Are you even
hearing me?

13:49.916 --> 13:52.048
No, not really.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.008
I'm sorry. I'm trying to figure
out what to wear tonight.

13:56.183 --> 13:59.142
Um, excuse me. Hi.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.144
We're having
a private conversation.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.493
Oh, I'm just
fixing Adam a plate.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.844
Okay, well, make it quick.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.411
So where's Evan taking
you on this big date?

14:07.455 --> 14:09.152
Uh, it's not a date.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.677
And it's with Liam, not Evan.

14:12.721 --> 14:13.678
Oh, my God.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.419
I knew you weren't over Liam.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.508
I amover Liam. I am just
helping him with his memories.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.814
That is all.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860
His memories of
what your yoni looks like?

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
Fallon, this is
such a terrible idea.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.994
I'm going with you.I don't need a chaperone.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.867
Fine, you don't want me
to come, do me a favor.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.172
Every time you start to feel

14:29.216 --> 14:30.739
love butterflies
in your stomach,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.611
tear off a small piece of
bread and put it on the table.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.352
You know I don't eat bread.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.354
Not to eat.
To remind you to detach.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.052
Like you're detaching the bread.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.709
That's ridiculous,
but I do need your help.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.320
To pick out an outfit.

14:46.363 --> 14:50.019
Okay. On a scale from nun to
hooker, how sexy are we talking?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.891
Oh.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.384
BLAKE:
He just didn't show up?

15:07.428 --> 15:09.909
No. Well, he was
there somewhere,

15:09.952 --> 15:12.737
because he called
and said he'd still do the deal.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.697
It just has to be with you,
in person.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.351
Well, he can't
come to the house.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.874
And you can't leave, so...

15:20.049 --> 15:22.356
You're being monitored, Blake.

15:22.399 --> 15:24.097
And that thing
will let everyone know

15:24.140 --> 15:25.576
the second
you leave the property.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.100
I'm already on trial
for murder, honey.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.189
I can't get into much
more trouble than that.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.017
If you get caught,
you'll look guilty,

15:31.060 --> 15:32.714
and it will affect
the entire trial.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.672
And if we don't get to the jury,
it won't matter.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.413
How do you plan on keeping it
from going off?

15:36.457 --> 15:39.242
Well, who says
I'm taking it with me?

15:39.286 --> 15:40.983
This may be
my first ankle monitor,

15:41.027 --> 15:43.029
but it ain't
my first rodeo.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.423
I'm not sure if this is
interesting to you,

15:46.467 --> 15:48.164
but I found something
out about Liam.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.732
That's Fallon's
amnesiac ex, right?

15:50.775 --> 15:51.776
Yes. Did he get his memory back?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.691
No, but it sounded like Fallon

15:53.735 --> 15:55.432
was going on a date
with him tonight.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.043
Are you sure it wasn't a
business thing? Because they...

15:57.086 --> 15:58.827
No, no, no. It's definitely
a date, because she was

15:58.870 --> 16:01.264
supposed to go on a date
with someone else. Evan, maybe?

16:01.308 --> 16:03.266
Evan Tate. They're dating?Not anymore.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.747
It looks like she may be getting
back together with Liam.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.054
Uh, yeah, I'd really rather

16:08.097 --> 16:10.447
they didn't take a walk
down memory lane.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.623
It might be too
late to stop that.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.625
Unless we get Evan to show up
when Liam does.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.192
That would really
screw things up.

16:17.237 --> 16:18.629
But, um,

16:18.673 --> 16:20.414
I'm-a need your help with that.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.286
Although I... I don't want
you getting into trouble.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.636
I like a little trouble
every once in a while.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.291
I thought your issue
was with Cristal.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.077
My issue is with everyone
in this family except my father.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.383
I need to get back
to my rightful place.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.863
Well, where there's a
will, there's a way.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.473
Well, it's funny you should
say that, because I think

16:36.517 --> 16:37.605
where there's a will,
there's a stepmother

16:37.648 --> 16:38.867
trying to get her name in it.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.001
Which is another thing
I'd love your help with.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.227
Geez, Mom.

16:51.271 --> 16:52.750
How did you even get in here?

16:52.794 --> 16:54.709
That's the last thing
you need to be worried about

16:54.752 --> 16:57.016
after running around town
till all hours.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.582
So, what, I have a curfew now?No.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.628
But I can give you one
if I have to.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.065
If you act like a child,
I'll treat you like a child.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.240
What are you so upset about?

17:04.284 --> 17:06.416
I'm upset because
I called in a favor

17:06.460 --> 17:09.332
to some of those photographers
to catch you out with Culhane

17:09.376 --> 17:10.812
to get your face out there.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.249
But then they told me that
you ran away from them.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.947
I'm sorry. I guess I just
got caught up in the moment.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.601
That's not how this works.

17:17.645 --> 17:21.344
We don't get caught up.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.086
We do what we're supposed to do
when we're supposed to do it.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.392
Got it?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.610
Yes, ma'am.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.917
But I got you an audition

17:28.960 --> 17:31.093
at Club Colby tomorrow at 3:00

17:31.137 --> 17:33.835
with Monica and
Fallon Carrington.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.577
This is what we've
been working towards.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.449
I really appreciate this,
Fallon.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.103
I know it can't be easy.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.627
Anything I can do to help the
less fortunate. You know me.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.020
Or, at least, you used to.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.109
See, it's just so random.
I mean, I could be, like,

17:47.153 --> 17:48.589
working out or watching TV.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.547
It's just like, boom.
They just show up like flashes.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.853
You know, sometimes
it's full memories,

17:51.896 --> 17:53.550
and sometimes just, like,
little pieces.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.378
And that's all great,

17:55.422 --> 17:58.120
but at the risk
of sounding narcissistic,

17:58.164 --> 18:00.470
where exactly do I fit
into all of this?

18:00.514 --> 18:02.385
That's what I want to find out,
because between

18:02.429 --> 18:05.388
what Ashley told me, my mom
and-and the book I wrote,

18:05.432 --> 18:07.477
everything's just kind of like
a giant jumble in my head.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.044
So, the ski trip.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.567
That waswith Ashley?

18:10.611 --> 18:12.308
Yes.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.485
And I would rather not talk
about that, if possible.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.140
A weekend in Jamaica?

18:18.184 --> 18:20.882
Afraid that must've
been Ashley, as well.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.058
So Turks and Caicos was us.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.668
Okay, you know, I, uh...

18:24.712 --> 18:26.496
I don't think
I like this game anymore.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.933
Can we please talk
about something else?Yeah. Yeah.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.065
I'm sorry.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.330
This is so helpful.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
Are you gonna eat
any of that bread?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.726
You don't even remember
that I don't eat bread.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.339
Oh, God.

18:49.084 --> 18:50.825
Okay, now what?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.132
Um, knowing my father, he
keeps important paperwork

18:53.175 --> 18:55.351
in the bottom left-hand drawer
of his desk.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.092
But it-it's probably locked.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.399
What do you expect to find
in this will?

18:59.442 --> 19:00.878
I'm worried that Cristal's
trying to disinherit me.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.315
This is the easiest way
to find out.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.012
Or you could just ask.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.448
Try the-the desk behind you.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.581
Uh, the far left drawer.
The key should be in there.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.452
BLAKE:
I'll take it
in the study.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.501
BLAKE:
No, I left my
notes upstairs.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.678
That was too close.
We'll have to try another time.

19:20.637 --> 19:21.943
FALLON:
This whole night

19:21.986 --> 19:23.118
has basically been me

19:23.162 --> 19:24.946
helping you with
memories of Ashley,

19:24.989 --> 19:26.252
and I got to be honest.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.123
It's not exactly my idea
of a great date.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.039
Well, I never said
this was an actual date.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.824
I mean, it's more
of an exercise.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.304
Well, I hate exercise,

19:35.348 --> 19:38.873
which is yet another thing
you don't remember about me.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.440
Look, it may not seem like it,

19:40.483 --> 19:42.616
but remembering
anything at all is...

19:42.659 --> 19:43.965
is a really good sign.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.880
Yeah. For you.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.318
Liam, nothing has changed
when it comes to us,

19:49.362 --> 19:51.146
and it doesn't feel great to me.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.800
I mean, yeah,
you remember us

19:52.843 --> 19:55.411
in a park, which is great.

19:55.455 --> 19:59.633
But do you remember
that we were engaged?

19:59.676 --> 20:01.722
I mean, do you remember
that you loved me?

20:01.765 --> 20:03.854
Do you realize how painful
this is for me right now?

20:03.898 --> 20:07.075
I'm sorry. I really didn't.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.860
I-I don't know.
Maybe this wasn't the best idea.

20:09.904 --> 20:13.864
Look, Liam, I don't know
if you're moving on

20:13.908 --> 20:17.259
or you're moving forward
or you're moving backwards,

20:17.303 --> 20:20.088
but I just... I feel like
I'm moving in circles,

20:20.131 --> 20:21.524
and I just can't do it anymore.

20:21.568 --> 20:22.743
Okay? I'm sorry. I can't.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.664
Excuse me.Hey.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.406
Why don't you do everyone
a favor and leave Fallon alone.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.669
I'm sorry. Who are you?

20:35.712 --> 20:36.931
Someone who cares about her.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.107
Well, I'm not trying
to hurt her at all.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.370
Good. Because I don't
want to have to hurt you.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.417
Excuse me?

20:44.460 --> 20:46.332
Just don't test me.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.117
Stay away from her, okay?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.818
It is much cozier in here.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.037
Although I did have fun

20:56.080 --> 20:57.691
running from
the photographers yesterday.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.520
Though, Dominique
was not thrilled.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.957
How did she even know?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.002
Dominique somehow
knows everything.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.004
Well...

21:07.048 --> 21:09.355
there are
no photographers in here.

21:09.398 --> 21:13.010
So, uh... we can do
whatever we want?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.547
BLAKE:
You ready?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.244
JENNINGS:
No. Are you?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.115
Nerves of steel.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.466
Okay, we have 45 seconds
to get this right,

21:33.509 --> 21:35.555
or I go back to prison.
No pressure.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.387
Okay, the battery
should be dead in three,

21:41.430 --> 21:42.736
two,

21:42.779 --> 21:44.259
one.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.347
Go.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.704
Hurry.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.315
Now. Pull.

22:02.451 --> 22:03.626
Get the cord. Now.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.370
Okay.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.503
It's resetting.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.290
And there's the police.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.771
Right on time.

22:17.814 --> 22:20.034
Yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot
to charge it last night,

22:20.077 --> 22:22.036
but it's plugged in now,
as you can see.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.211
Yeah, and it's charging.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.604
Thank you.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.781
What is that?
Are you baking cookies?

22:27.824 --> 22:29.391
No. That's what's

22:29.435 --> 22:31.437
telling me that Blake's
house arrest ankle monitor

22:31.480 --> 22:32.916
just went off for a minute.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.832
How the hell do you know that?'Cause I hacked it.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.182
Hi. Jeff Colby, tech genius.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.575
You might've heard of me.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.403
Why on earth are you
keeping track of Blake?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.971
Because ever since he had
that judge thrown off his trial,

22:44.014 --> 22:45.712
the whole thing's felt crooked.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.236
I'll bet he's trying
to leave the manor right now

22:48.279 --> 22:49.629
to do something else shady.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.152
Uh, hello.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.502
May I speak to Blake Carrington?

22:53.546 --> 22:55.504
Oh, this is Richard
from his lawyer's office.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.114
It's, uh...
it's kind of an emergency.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.420
I'm sure he's there.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.422
It's probably just a glitch.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.816
Not available? Really?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.165
Oh, no. That's okay.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.036
I'll, uh, I'll just
try him back later.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.647
Thanks.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.344
Oh, he's definitely gone.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.128
And if Blake gets
caught off his property,

23:11.172 --> 23:13.261
he's in violation
of that court order.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.654
Doesn't matter what he's doing.

23:14.697 --> 23:17.178
He'll face more charges
and go back to jail.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.361
I just got your message
15 minutes ago.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.276
I am so sorry.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.366
Not only did you blow
another golden opportunity.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.021
You made me look like an idiot
in front of Monica.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.675
Well, where is she?
I'll apologize.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.459
She had somewhere else
she needed to be,

23:37.503 --> 23:39.983
which is why she and Fallon
moved up the audition,

23:40.027 --> 23:42.508
which you would have known
had you checked your phone.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.292
You said 3:00 p.m. I'm sorry.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.685
Where the hell were you?

23:45.728 --> 23:47.208
That's none of your business.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.602
You aremy business, sweetie.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.126
Now, really, where were you?

23:54.476 --> 23:57.131
You were with Michael Culhane
again, weren't you?

23:57.174 --> 23:59.742
So what?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.744
No, I like him.
He's fun.

24:03.790 --> 24:08.142
Do you think
Kim married Kanye for fun?

24:08.185 --> 24:10.492
Wait, who said anything
about getting married?

24:10.536 --> 24:12.712
I wanted you two together
for the free publicity.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.322
But since he's become
a distraction,

24:14.365 --> 24:15.715
you're done with him.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.981
You don't tell me what to do.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.765
Excuse me?

24:22.809 --> 24:24.985
Yes. Excuse you.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.770
The problem with
your plans is that

24:27.814 --> 24:29.642
they never include what I want.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.992
And right now, I want
some space to breathe.

24:32.035 --> 24:35.038
So just do your job,
and I will do mine.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.565
FALLON:
Hey.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.827
Thank you for coming.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.263
Are we all squared away
with the name?

24:42.306 --> 24:45.440
Yeah. All you have to do is,
uh, sign where indicated.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.748
Is everything okay?

24:48.791 --> 24:50.358
Look, I'm sorry I had to
cancel dinner so last minute.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.142
Was your mother upset?

24:52.186 --> 24:53.840
Please tell me she didn't
have another panic attack.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.363
No, no, she's fine.

24:55.406 --> 24:57.147
And I, uh, understand.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.280
When Liam calls,
you have to answer.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.673
Your assistant told me

25:00.716 --> 25:02.892
you wanted to meet
at 9:00 for drinks.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.112
When I got there,
I saw you and Liam,

25:05.155 --> 25:06.896
so I'm not sure
what's going on.

25:06.940 --> 25:11.118
I am. My assistant didn't know
where I was going. It was Adam.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.381
He is screwing with my
life because he is blind,

25:13.424 --> 25:15.383
and he has nothing better to do.Nevertheless,

25:15.426 --> 25:17.690
I wish you'd been
honest with me.Look, I was just

25:17.733 --> 25:19.256
going to meet with Liam
to make sure

25:19.300 --> 25:22.172
the relationship was totally
over and, believe me, it is.

25:22.216 --> 25:25.393
I hope so, you know, because
I... I saw how upset you were.

25:25.436 --> 25:27.526
But whatever is or was
going on with Liam

25:27.569 --> 25:29.789
has nothing to do
with my feelings for you.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.052
He doesn't even remember me,
and you and I are--

25:32.095 --> 25:33.880
we're just getting
to know each other again.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.012
And I really would like
to see where it goes.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.624
So come with me to the
press conference tonight.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.886
Okay, I'll introduce you

25:39.929 --> 25:41.278
as the in-house counsel
to Fallon Unlimited.

25:41.322 --> 25:42.715
It'll be kind of like a date.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.673
A, uh, date surrounded

25:44.717 --> 25:46.414
by a bunch of reporters
asking questions.

25:46.457 --> 25:49.591
That's how I roll.
You'll get used to it.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.991
Hey. Your new Anders told
me to hang out in here.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.601
Said they couldn't find Blake.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.647
I'm sorry.
What can I help you with?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.344
Oh, youcan't help me
with anything.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.476
I'm just here
to talk to my Uncle Blake

26:05.520 --> 26:06.739
about a business opportunity.

26:06.782 --> 26:08.131
Should only take a few minutes.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.350
Right.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.700
Um, the only problem is
he's resting.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.659
I didn't think house arrest
would be so strenuous.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.834
You'd be surprised.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.662
Those ankle monitors
are pretty heavy.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.577
Yeah, I bet.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.840
Well, I can just wait.

26:20.883 --> 26:24.408
Actually, that's probably not
a great idea.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.628
He gets a little cranky
after a nap.

26:26.672 --> 26:27.890
Uh, but I can relay a message.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.109
Yeah, that's okay.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.504
I'll just tell him
when I find him.

26:35.506 --> 26:36.856
MAN:
Our parents, our teachers,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.466
our institutions, all flood
our minds with poison...

26:38.509 --> 26:39.641
Where are you going?

26:39.685 --> 26:41.469
It's like cutie-palooza
over there.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.732
See, we're always looking
outward for the answers.

26:43.776 --> 26:47.257
But spoiler alert:
the answers are right inside us.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.782
I thought you were
supposed to help me.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.305
Hello?

26:51.348 --> 26:53.524
Fine.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.917
I'm going alone.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.919
MAN:
...for the simple fact
that the world is always

26:56.963 --> 26:58.834
trying to drown out
that little voice that's saying,

26:58.878 --> 27:02.055
"Trust your instincts."

27:02.098 --> 27:04.274
And that voice...

27:05.580 --> 27:07.147
...is the only one
that matters.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.539
Thank you.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.503
Pretty thought-provoking speech.

27:15.546 --> 27:18.288
I'm just a simple man trying to
get a message out to the people.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.030
Although, my instincts
are saying

27:21.074 --> 27:23.554
that you didn't pay
the entry fee.Yeah.

27:23.598 --> 27:27.210
Well, uh, I was still very
impressed by the message

27:27.254 --> 27:28.777
and  you.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.127
Were you impressed enough
to pay full price next time?

27:31.171 --> 27:32.476
No.Hmm.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.565
But impressed enough
to buy the first round.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.525
Hey, tell me something.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.179
Does Adam Carrington
still have that blue coupe

27:39.222 --> 27:40.354
with the black rims?

27:40.397 --> 27:42.530
Yeah. That is one sweet ride.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.663
It doesn't look like it's here.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.665
Uh, maybe Fallon took it out.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.842
Clearly, Adam isn't going
to be driving it anytime soon.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.713
Poor guy.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.021
Yeah. Poor guy.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.638
Yo. IG family,
let's play a game.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.988
I'm somewhere in Atlanta
driving around my car.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.990
The first five people to spot me

28:08.034 --> 28:11.820
and hit my DMs with my location
get five K in cash each.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.867
Car details are in my bio.
Catch me if you can.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.001
BLAKE: Okay, I have jumped
through all your hoops.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.090
So, if we could make this
as quick as possible,

28:21.134 --> 28:22.613
it would be greatly
appreciated.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.180
How the hell you get
that ankle monitor off?

28:24.224 --> 28:26.095
Is that your idea of
"quick as possible"?

28:26.139 --> 28:28.445
I need your help,
and I'm willing to pay.

28:28.489 --> 28:31.013
Look, you're in charge of
sequestering the jury, right?

28:31.057 --> 28:32.841
I set up
all transportation, meals,

28:32.885 --> 28:34.451
all the logistics during trials.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.540
That is fascinating.

28:36.584 --> 28:39.761
I need that jury at a
specific hotel-- La Mirage.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.937
Can you make that happen?Yeah, not a problem.

28:41.981 --> 28:44.461
But why you want the jury living
in that bougie hotel anyway?

28:44.505 --> 28:46.986
It's an environment
that I can control.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.292
Okay, I can make it happen,
but it's gonna cost you.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.207
MAN:
There it is!I guess you can afford it.

28:51.251 --> 28:52.208
That's the car.

28:52.252 --> 28:53.557
Yeah, I can pay.

28:53.601 --> 28:56.386
Did you tell anyone else
about this meeting?

28:56.430 --> 28:58.127
'Cause that would be an issue.

28:58.171 --> 28:59.955
Just you and me,
unless you told people.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.740
We need to wrap this up now.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.490
I know you can't
see me right now,

29:13.534 --> 29:15.144
but my face does
not look happy.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.493
Hello, Fallon.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.495
Mm, you do smell mad.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.019
Ugh. Gross.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.151
Do you really have
nothing better to do

29:22.195 --> 29:23.718
than to screw with my life?

29:23.762 --> 29:24.980
At this point, not really.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.243
But since I can barely
feed myself right now,

29:27.287 --> 29:29.724
how could I possibly
mess with you?I don't know.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.117
You always seem to find a way.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.119
Like inviting Evan
to my dinner with Liam.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.947
I mean, seriously,
what was that about?

29:34.990 --> 29:36.731
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.342
And it's not my fault if you
can't keep your men straight.

29:39.386 --> 29:43.607
But even if I had told,
uh, is it Eric, to show up...

29:43.651 --> 29:45.000
My eyes are rolling.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.089
...it would have been
to get you away from Liam,

29:47.133 --> 29:49.265
because I don't think that's
a healthy relationship for you.

29:49.309 --> 29:54.053
I need you to get your own life
and stay the hell out of mine.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.799
Dominique?

30:00.842 --> 30:03.714
I know we don't
know each other well, Michael,

30:03.758 --> 30:07.109
but you're going to stop
seeing Vanessa immediately.

30:07.153 --> 30:09.895
I don't remember asking for
your opinion on my social life.

30:09.938 --> 30:12.636
I'm not giving you my opinion.
This is fact.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.379
Wow. You really are
as crazy as she says.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.251
What if I told the press
you engineered

30:18.294 --> 30:21.210
that entire Victor Diaz attack
for free publicity?

30:21.254 --> 30:23.430
So I'm Jussie Smollett now?

30:23.473 --> 30:24.953
Because that's ridiculous,

30:24.997 --> 30:26.955
and there's no evidence
to back it up.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.609
I don't need evidence, darling.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.959
By the time
I'm done planting stories,

30:31.003 --> 30:33.309
your credibility will be shot,

30:33.353 --> 30:37.226
and the league will force you
to sell the Atlantix.

30:37.270 --> 30:41.056
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have your career to bury.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.061
Vanessa and I have been
on two dates.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.455
Not sure why
you're overreacting here.

30:48.498 --> 30:51.414
Because I've invested too much
into her to have you ruin it

30:51.458 --> 30:54.504
when we are on the cusp
of something great.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.985
I'm not doing anything
to hurt her career,

30:57.029 --> 31:00.467
but it seems to me
like you're using her.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.469
Are you kidding me?

31:02.512 --> 31:05.515
I have been grooming Vanessa
since she was a little girl.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.126
Choir practice, talent shows,

31:07.169 --> 31:09.171
voice lessons.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.391
I took her
to her first concert ever--

31:11.434 --> 31:13.132
Whitney Houston in London.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.047
I have invested
my time,

31:15.090 --> 31:17.571
my money and my heart
into this girl.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.704
There is too much on the line
to allow you to distract her.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.184
You know what?

31:22.228 --> 31:25.840
You might be a headache
that I don't have the pill for.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.276
You keep your drama.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.191
I'll save my sanity.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.802
I'm glad we've come
to an understanding.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.207
Hey.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.730
Blake. Hey.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.733
Who the hell are you?

31:49.777 --> 31:52.127
And what are you doing getting
into Adam Carrington's car?

31:52.171 --> 31:54.390
Wasn't getting into that car.
I was just taking a walk.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.436
I just saw you
turn off the alarm.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.397
Hey.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.411
Hello, everybody.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.848
Thank you so much for coming.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.502
By the end of today,

32:19.546 --> 32:21.461
hopefully, half of you
will be writing about this,

32:21.504 --> 32:23.158
and the other half
will be begging me

32:23.202 --> 32:25.073
for ad space
in my new magazine.

32:26.553 --> 32:30.731
I am here to introduce you
to Fallon Unlimited,

32:30.774 --> 32:33.777
which is more than just a name
that I paid a lot of money for.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.780
It is a brand, it's a lifestyle,

32:36.824 --> 32:38.957
and "unlimited" really is
the right word,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.611
because we are planning
to have businesses

32:41.655 --> 32:44.223
in every form of media
you can imagine,

32:44.266 --> 32:47.356
including our new
namesake magazine.

32:50.272 --> 32:53.188
I am presenting a new vision
and a new mission:

32:53.232 --> 32:55.843
to focus on girls and women

32:55.886 --> 32:58.846
feeling their own
unlimited power.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.804
Any questions?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.285
Yeah, I have a question.

33:04.504 --> 33:05.984
FALLON:
Excuse me?

33:08.029 --> 33:10.292
LIAM:
This new vision that
you have for the future,

33:10.336 --> 33:14.209
is there any possibility of
also going back to the past?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.046
The reason we are moving forward

33:25.090 --> 33:27.744
is so that people can
leave the past behind.

33:27.788 --> 33:31.052
What if you lose subscribers who
liked it the way that it was?

33:31.096 --> 33:35.143
I don't think that will happen,
because most subscribers

33:35.187 --> 33:37.319
don't even remember
what it was like.

33:37.363 --> 33:40.018
I mean, they must be thinking of
a different magazine. Questions?

33:40.061 --> 33:41.932
What if they're starting
to remember this one?

33:41.976 --> 33:44.326
FALLON:
Well, I can't just change

33:44.370 --> 33:48.069
my entire company
because someone thinks

33:48.113 --> 33:51.029
they may possibly remember
what a magazine did

33:51.072 --> 33:53.335
or did not look like
two years ago.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.816
REPORTER:
Hey, can someone else
ask a question here?

33:55.859 --> 33:57.687
In a minute.Okay, by the way,

33:57.731 --> 34:00.690
Fallon Unlimited
has new subscribers.

34:00.734 --> 34:02.605
Okay? Who actually
know the brand

34:02.649 --> 34:03.867
and appreciate it.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.044
Isn't your favorite color
cobalt blue?

34:06.087 --> 34:08.350
Well, it's...

34:08.394 --> 34:09.960
Yes, it is.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.440
And your favorite flowers are...

34:11.484 --> 34:12.920
are white lilies, right?

34:12.963 --> 34:15.096
Okay, I don't know what
this has to do with anything.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.098
It has to do with
the fact that

34:17.142 --> 34:20.275
I remember, Fallon.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.712
I remember that you love
drinking Southsides

34:22.756 --> 34:25.759
and eating bacon and
driving in convertibles.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.413
Liam, we can't do this anymore.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.806
And you hate wine
coolers and, uh,

34:29.850 --> 34:31.765
bangs.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.028
Well, I mean, who doesn't?

34:34.072 --> 34:36.726
Fallon, I'm not doing this
to blow up your world.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.728
I am doing this because
I remember my world

34:38.772 --> 34:40.469
won't be the same
without you in it.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.123
Most importantly,

34:42.167 --> 34:44.647
I remember
I was in love with you.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.099
Good news.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.665
I found the perfect guy.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.233
He's smart and funny and cute.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.582
Well, if I wanted
all those qualities,

35:06.626 --> 35:07.757
I would just date myself.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.411
No, he's not for you;
he's for me.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.847
I'm dating Joel Turner.

35:10.891 --> 35:14.024
The-the speaker guy
from the conference.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.765
Kirby, I'll let you
stay here if you want.

35:15.809 --> 35:17.941
You don't have to sleep with
a different guest every night

35:17.985 --> 35:19.682
just to keep a roof
over your head.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.293
We're not sleeping together.

35:21.336 --> 35:23.469
He's actually done a lot to help
me build my self-confidence.

35:23.512 --> 35:25.601
I might even be able
to be my own CEO.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.342
He's all about learning
to trust yourself.

35:27.386 --> 35:28.387
That sounds dangerous.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.391
What's wrong?

35:32.434 --> 35:35.045
The Atlantix's next opponent
just canceled their reservation.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.047
Why?Because the Victor Diaz story

35:37.091 --> 35:39.311
just came out, and now they
don't feel safe staying here.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.965
This is a disaster.I'm sorry, Sam.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.706
Hey, you.
Oh, Joel.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.622
Um, hi. This is
the-the hotel owner,

35:46.666 --> 35:48.537
Samuel Jones-Carrington.Pleasure.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.278
You don't have
any interest

35:50.322 --> 35:52.585
in joining Kirby and I
in Savannah, do you?

35:52.628 --> 35:54.108
You're going to Savannah?KIRBY:
Mm-hmm.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.066
Oh, I take groups down
from time to time

35:56.110 --> 35:57.981
for meditative retreats.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.766
There really is nothing like
the isolation of the country

35:59.809 --> 36:02.247
to make you feel a true
need for belonging.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.553
That sounds a little creepy.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.076
Well, I'm-I'm sure it does,

36:06.120 --> 36:07.991
to people without the capacity
to understand.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.212
Uh, we might even be
talking about Joel writing

36:11.256 --> 36:13.171
a book for Femperial.
Do you want to come?

36:13.214 --> 36:14.737
No, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

36:14.781 --> 36:18.306
I have, um, enough problems
to deal with here at home.

36:18.350 --> 36:21.048
Okay. Well, your loss.Hmm.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.057
Ah, nice of Sam
to set you up like this.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.493
Yeah, I like it.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.408
Better than where my stepmom
and I lived growing up.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.801
Oh, you lived with your stepmom?

36:34.844 --> 36:37.543
Yeah, my mom died when
I was really young,

36:37.586 --> 36:40.241
then my dad got remarried,
but then he left us all.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.592
Wow, I'm-I'm sorry.
Th-That's tough.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.941
Yeah, it was tough.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.074
But my stepmom
is fantastic.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.380
She encouraged me to sing.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.946
Paid for years
of vocal lessons.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.948
Took me to my
first concert.

36:51.992 --> 36:53.167
We saw Whitney.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.864
Where'd you see Whitney?

36:54.908 --> 36:56.736
We flew to London to see her.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.433
Best night of my life.

36:58.477 --> 37:01.784
That's funny...
because Dominique told me

37:01.828 --> 37:03.786
she took you to see
your first concert.

37:03.830 --> 37:06.528
Whitney Houston.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.964
In London.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.445
She did?

37:10.489 --> 37:12.273
Well, I don't,
I don't know why...

37:12.317 --> 37:14.449
Vanessa, stop.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.234
Dominique's your stepmom, right?

37:16.277 --> 37:18.279
I wanted to tell you.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.325
I was going to, I swear.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.283
You got to promise not
to tell Jeff and Monica

37:22.327 --> 37:24.633
anything about this, please.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.635
If they hear we're related
from someone else,

37:26.679 --> 37:28.246
they will never accept me.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.510
And Dominique will kill me.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.993
So you just snuck in there
and saw it?

37:37.037 --> 37:39.213
I was able to swipe the key,
then I went back during lunch.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.519
You took the actual will?

37:40.562 --> 37:42.651
No. Just pictures.
I'm not crazy.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.827
And? Wh...

37:44.871 --> 37:47.047
This legalese is pretty
thick, but it looks like

37:47.090 --> 37:48.962
Blake changed it
pretty recently

37:49.005 --> 37:52.008
and Cristal is
the sole heir.

37:53.923 --> 37:57.579
I'm sure he set up
something else for you.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.146
No.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.279
No. I...

38:01.322 --> 38:03.237
I had a feeling.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.849
She won, and now I have nothing
and he's abandoning me.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.503
You don't know that.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.026
Cristal's gonna pay
for this.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.419
Okay.

38:11.463 --> 38:13.769
But I can still help
you win Blake back.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.684
And, in the meantime,

38:15.728 --> 38:19.209
even if you're losing Blake,
you've still got me.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.835
FALLON:
Your fancy words

38:35.878 --> 38:38.707
were nice, but now it's time
to put your memory to the test.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.057
I didn't realize that
there was gonna be a quiz.

38:41.101 --> 38:43.756
You forget, I like
keeping you on your toes.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.975
Am I gonna be graded on this?

38:46.019 --> 38:48.064
Most definitely.

38:48.108 --> 38:51.894
Tell me, do you remember this?

38:55.071 --> 38:56.159
Not really.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.511
How about... this?

39:04.124 --> 39:05.517
That's vaguely familiar.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.909
Okay.

39:06.953 --> 39:10.130
Well, just this once,
I'll give you a reminder.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.437
Oh.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.224
Wait a minute.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.182
How did you...?

39:19.226 --> 39:21.402
Yeah, every step is strategic
and sets up the next several.

39:21.446 --> 39:22.447
It's just like the trial.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.100
First the judge, then the jury.

39:24.144 --> 39:25.493
It's all falling
into place.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.277
Having the jury at La Mirage
will be a big help.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.541
I just have to convince
Sam and Anders

39:29.584 --> 39:31.238
to allow me access to the floor,

39:31.281 --> 39:33.501
then persuade one of the jurors
to vote for acquittal.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.111
There's a hung jury.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.331
It's too expensive to retry me.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.289
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, Mr. Carrington.

39:39.333 --> 39:40.639
JEFF:
Blake.

39:40.682 --> 39:42.771
Hey. How was your nap?

39:42.815 --> 39:44.947
Well, it was great, thank you.

39:44.991 --> 39:47.385
Uh, I take my beauty rest
where I can get it.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.864
You think I don't know
what you're up to?

39:48.908 --> 39:51.563
Well, it's a king's gambit.
It's pretty basic, actually.

39:51.606 --> 39:54.566
I may not
have been able to catch you

39:54.609 --> 39:56.611
on your little
off-campus excursion,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.352
but your jury plan is dead.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.310
Yeah.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.138
I ran into your man, uh, Greg.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.706
He didn't want to chat,
but I found out who he is,

40:04.750 --> 40:07.274
and I told him about my cousin,
the police chief.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.189
Put a pretty good scare in him.

40:09.232 --> 40:12.366
Well, no crime
has been committed.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.021
Not one that you can prove.

40:15.064 --> 40:16.936
Oh, of course not.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.807
I know you're
too smart for that.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.635
But I also know
he won't be making

40:20.679 --> 40:22.724
any more risky moves
on your behalf.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.160
Hey, would you do me a favor

40:24.204 --> 40:25.858
and get out of my house
right now?

40:25.901 --> 40:28.382
Oh, you don't
have to tell me twice.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.000
Damn it.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.481
This puts us back
to square one with the jury.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.701
I guess it's better
that this blew up now

40:42.744 --> 40:45.530
as opposed to
in the middle of the trial.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.227
Then it would've
been over for me.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.055
I guess we dodged a bullet.

40:49.098 --> 40:51.013
Yeah.

40:51.057 --> 40:53.015
But with Jeff shooting,

40:53.059 --> 40:56.018
I don't know how many
more misses I have.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.938
Uh... hi.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.679
Your, uh, real assistant
let me in.

41:04.723 --> 41:08.030
Ah, yes. I should
probably fire her pretty soon.

41:08.074 --> 41:10.119
She assumes
I'm still in-house counsel,

41:10.163 --> 41:13.035
which, uh, I'm thinking
is not a great idea.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.037
Look, Evan, I really am sorry.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.952
It's just that
Liam and I have this...

41:16.996 --> 41:18.737
Hey, hey. I-I get it.You do?

41:18.780 --> 41:20.086
Yes.

41:20.129 --> 41:21.653
What you two have is special.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.698
You know, I can see that.

41:23.742 --> 41:26.527
And I don't want to stand
in the way of true love.

41:26.571 --> 41:28.442
I guess I'm just a romantic.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.401
Wow. Well, thank you.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.534
I hope we can still be friends.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.233
Oh, no.
Somebody shut down

41:37.277 --> 41:39.105
the Fallon Unlimited
website.

41:39.148 --> 41:41.716
Great first day.
Hey, Allison!

41:41.760 --> 41:43.544
Allison!
