00:08.175 --> 00:09.308
<i> [john] let me ask</i>
<i>  you somethin'.</i>

00:10.177 --> 00:13.112
Would you consider
goin' into a partnership?

00:16.550 --> 00:19.184
<i> [jeremy] just north</i>
<i>  of cocke county, tennessee,</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:22.388
<i>  mark and digger face</i>
<i>  an unexpected dilemma.</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:24.556
<i>  Unlimited access to one</i>
<i>  of the best</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.558
<i>  water sources</i>
<i>  in the country.</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:28.660
<i>  But, only if they partner</i>
<i>  with its owner</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:30.529
<i>  on a legal distillery.</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:32.598
[digger] there ain't nothing
tempts me any more

00:32.600 --> 00:33.932
than that right there.

00:34.869 --> 00:37.403
-There's a bet here.
-Yeah.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.639
I'm, I'm gonna have
to graciously decline

00:40.641 --> 00:43.575
right now just simply
because I don't know

00:43.577 --> 00:46.578
if I'm ready for that jump
in my life right now.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.014
Everybody's been told
the old cliche,

00:49.016 --> 00:50.249
if you love what you do,
you'll never

00:50.251 --> 00:52.317
work a day
in your life.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.453
I don't consider this work.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.156
<i>  I'm in the woods</i>
<i>  with my best friend.</i>

00:57.158 --> 01:01.226
And if I go legal, then
it becomes a job.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.530
And I'm afraid if it becomes
a job, I'll no longer love it.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.465
Well, guys, you know, when
the water leaves

01:06.467 --> 01:09.068
this property, I know
for a fact

01:09.070 --> 01:10.769
based on what I've seen
on the maps

01:10.771 --> 01:13.172
it probably travels two miles
before there's any

01:13.174 --> 01:16.008
other influence
of a tributary into it.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.945
What you're saying
is that once this

01:19.947 --> 01:22.548
water leaves your boundaries,
you no longer

01:22.550 --> 01:24.216
care how it's policed.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.119
Exactly. That would be
the best way I could put it.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.089
<i> [mark] once it runs past</i>
<i>  his property line,</i>

01:30.091 --> 01:31.790
he's no longer
in charge of it.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.192
John, thank you, sir.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.694
<i>  So, we might go further</i>
<i>  downstream,</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:37.896
find a still site
and continue making

01:37.898 --> 01:39.398
this tennessee whiskey.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.233
[digger]
how come, man, you can't
be lucky enough

01:41.235 --> 01:43.902
to have a piece of property
with water like he's owning?

01:43.904 --> 01:46.605
Well, I tend to refer
to my situation

01:46.607 --> 01:47.940
as financially embarrassed.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.208
[mark laughs]

01:49.243 --> 01:52.578
<i> [mark] this water, the quality</i>
<i>  of it, is not gonna change</i>

01:52.580 --> 01:55.013
until tributaries start
running into it

01:55.015 --> 01:57.116
and dilutin' its purity.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.918
Over yonder's where
we have to go with this.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.087
I don't know, we might get
through this culvert.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.822
So, we're gonna scout
this source

02:03.824 --> 02:07.126
a little farther
downstream and see if we can't

02:07.128 --> 02:09.328
<i>  find a suitable spot</i>
<i>  for a still site</i>

02:09.330 --> 02:11.964
using the same water,
but on different property.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.233
It don't look bad
through here, bud.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.567
All right, it's clear
as a bell down there

02:15.569 --> 02:17.236
except for that
big snake nest.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.570
[mark laughs]

02:29.483 --> 02:31.550
[mike] man, I'm ready
to put some benjamins
in the old pocket.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.585
-What about you?
-Ready, freddy.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.022
<i> [jeremy] over the</i>
<i>  state line in haywood county,</i>

02:37.024 --> 02:40.292
<i>  north carolina, moonshiners</i>
<i>  mike and jerry</i>

02:40.294 --> 02:43.195
<i>  are busy turning a windfall</i>
<i>  of blueberries</i>

02:43.197 --> 02:44.897
<i>  into high-end brandy.</i>

02:44.899 --> 02:49.001
Ooh boy!
That's blueberry in it.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.436
<i> [mike] me and jerry, we wanna</i>
<i>  make top shelf,</i>

02:51.438 --> 02:53.038
high dollar premium
alcohol.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.040
<i>  That's our goal</i>
<i>  for this season.</i>

02:55.042 --> 02:57.509
You know, less alcohol
but for a higher price.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.244
That's what we're
tryna do.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.579
You get your snort in it.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.582
What's it taste like?
Tastes pretty good.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.386
<i> [jerry] oh, god.</i>
<i>  Something is ready.</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:11.590
Holy.
Oh, my god.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.025
-That is fan...
-That's good,

03:13.027 --> 03:14.693
of a great crack,
just like it is.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.461
When you mash in
fruit and ferment it,

03:16.463 --> 03:17.796
it turns into wine.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.699
-It's a semi-sweet, dry.
-Semi-dry, yeah.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.301
-Oh, my god. It's good.
-It's dry wine.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.304
This blueberry mash,
this is some of the finest
looking wine

03:25.306 --> 03:27.606
a man could ever
blink his eyes on.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.209
Whatever we've done, by god,
we've done somethin' right.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.711
Let's get this stuff skimmed
off here and get it
in the pot.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.347
Got a nice, thick cake
on the top of it.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.783
<i>  Really, really pretty,</i>
<i>  real deep dark in color.</i>

03:38.786 --> 03:41.787
It smells great.
Tastes damn good, too.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.656
[mike] get some of that fine
blueberry wine pouring here.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.435
That's about full,
cap her off.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.672
When we get this started,
you can tap that cap a little.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.975
<i> [jerry] the pasteless cap.</i>

04:02.977 --> 04:05.310
-[mike] the pasteless cap.
-[jerry] authoritative.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.884
[mike]
hey, lets go over and
get yourself

04:12.886 --> 04:15.020
-a little bit of that wine.
-[jerry] that'd be good.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.888
[mike]
<i>  you know, I've bought a lot</i>
<i>  of wine in my life.</i>

04:16.890 --> 04:19.091
I've made a lot of wine
at home in my life.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.993
<i>  But, this is some</i>
<i>  of the best stuff, I believe,</i>

04:20.995 --> 04:22.294
<i>  I've ever put</i>
<i>  in my mouth.</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:24.696
It's too good not to drink,
man, I'm telling you.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.434
Well, you know, who would
love this right here?

04:29.436 --> 04:32.037
-[jerry] who?
-Jenna, my fiance.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.406
Me and jenna, we've been
together now for seven years.

04:34.408 --> 04:38.577
We've actually been engaged
for basically seven years.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.579
<i>  We finally made a date</i>
<i>  to get married,</i>

04:40.581 --> 04:42.714
gonna go ahead
and put the last nail

04:42.716 --> 04:44.116
in the coffin so to speak.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.183
She likes stuff like it?

04:45.185 --> 04:47.152
Damn! She loves a good
wine, man.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.787
She'd be over here
with a damn straw,

04:48.789 --> 04:51.156
sucking the bottom out
of this damn thing.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.892
You know, the, the blueberry
brandy is real damn good.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.594
Oh, yeah, this is that
whole different...

04:55.596 --> 04:58.030
-[mike] whole different taste?
-...Whole different
complexity to it.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.298
I'm gonna throw
one at you,

04:59.300 --> 05:00.666
somethin' I ain't never
even done.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.101
-I ain't even attempted to do.
-[jerry] what'd that be?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.037
You know how I like bubbly
[bleep].

05:05.039 --> 05:06.638
You know, you like bubbly.
All right.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.474
I'd like to make
a champagne, sparkling wine,

05:09.476 --> 05:12.411
something like it out of this,
a champagne.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.382
<i> [jeremy] champagne</i>
<i>  is a sparkling wine produced</i>

05:17.384 --> 05:19.785
<i>  in the champagne region</i>
<i>  of France.</i>

05:19.787 --> 05:23.188
<i>  While today, champagne</i>
<i>  is coveted the world over.</i>

05:23.190 --> 05:25.290
<i>  It was actually discovered</i>
<i>  accidentally</i>

05:25.292 --> 05:27.192
<i>  in the 17th century.</i>

05:27.194 --> 05:30.028
<i>  The vendors in champagne</i>
<i>  were vying to produce</i>

05:30.030 --> 05:31.997
<i>  better wine than their</i>
<i>  southern neighbors</i>

05:31.999 --> 05:33.131
<i>  in burgundy.</i>

05:33.133 --> 05:35.267
<i>  However, champagne's colder</i>
<i>  winter</i>

05:35.269 --> 05:36.535
<i>  led to bottles</i>
<i>  freezing</i>

05:36.537 --> 05:38.904
<i>  and yeast going</i>
<i>  dormant.</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:42.207
<i>  When warmer weather returned,</i>
<i>  the yeast reactivated,</i>

05:42.209 --> 05:44.876
<i>  releasing carbon dioxide.</i>

05:44.878 --> 05:48.880
<i>  This buildup of pressure</i>
<i>  caused most bottles</i>
<i>  to explode.</i>

05:48.882 --> 05:50.882
<i>  But those that remained</i>
<i>  intact,</i>

05:50.884 --> 05:53.985
<i>  had champagne signature</i>
<i>  bubbles.</i>

05:53.987 --> 05:55.954
<i>  Legend has it that</i>
<i>  a french monk</i>

05:55.956 --> 05:59.825
<i>  named dom perignon turned</i>
<i>  this serendipitous mishap</i>

05:59.827 --> 06:03.495
<i>  into the celebratory beverage</i>
<i>  we have today.</i>

06:03.497 --> 06:05.397
Have you ever looked into
the process of champagne?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.165
To my understanding,
it's pretty lengthy.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.234
Well, we can do a quick
process on it, maybe.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.203
Just add the sparkling note
to it.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.572
You know, make it fizzy
like champagne.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.307
Well, I'm gonna do
it like a cider,

06:15.309 --> 06:17.042
you know, they actually
add a little bit of yeast

06:17.044 --> 06:18.310
and sugar before they
can it.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.778
-Mmm-hmm.
-To kinda give it that "shh."

06:19.780 --> 06:21.913
-a little crisp I guess.
-Yeah.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.815
And look at the volume
that we're gonna have

06:23.817 --> 06:25.250
as opposed
to distilling it out.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.120
-Oh, yeah.
-Seven gallons,
after we distill it?

06:28.122 --> 06:29.654
And we've got 50
sitting around here.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.123
It's a no damn brainer.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.958
Are you down for a damn
challenge or what?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.560
You know me. Challenge
is my middle name.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.529
-[mike] jerry,
we got liquor, brother.
-[jerry] love it.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.065
-[mike] see that's hitting
the jar.
-[jerry] good deal.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.566
<i> [mike] our blueberry brandy</i>
<i>  goes for about</i>

06:41.568 --> 06:43.468
<i>  a hundred and twenty-five</i>
<i>  dollars a gallon.</i>

06:43.470 --> 06:44.703
We can probably sell,

06:44.705 --> 06:46.171
you know, a bottle
of the champagne

06:46.173 --> 06:47.572
for 50 bucks a bottle.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.242
For volume, that's double
the money, pretty much.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.145
<i>  Also, we'll have a hell</i>
<i>  of a lot more volume</i>

06:53.147 --> 06:55.814
<i>  than if we distilled</i>
<i>  it off into brandy.</i>

06:55.816 --> 06:57.783
-[jerry] it's getting cold.
-[mike] heck yeah, son.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.251
But it's a lot of extra work

06:59.253 --> 07:01.153
and making champagne
is a process

07:01.155 --> 07:03.188
that neither one of us
is really familiar with.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.390
<i>  We got money to be made</i>
<i>  on the brandy.</i>

07:05.392 --> 07:07.192
<i>  But if we turn this</i>
<i>  into a champagne,</i>

07:07.194 --> 07:08.927
<i>  we may fail completely.</i>

07:08.929 --> 07:10.061
We're basically risking

07:10.063 --> 07:11.363
the bird that we have
in our hand

07:11.365 --> 07:13.064
for two in the damn bush here.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.034
-[mike] money in the bank.
-[jerry] money in the bank.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.169
[mike] in the bottle anyway.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.186
...Meet me over here,

07:34.188 --> 07:36.888
uh, man's supposed to bring
as much raspberries.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.756
How many has he got?

07:37.758 --> 07:40.158
I don't know, a bunch,
whate he thought.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.894
Five, six hundred pound
or somethin', I don't know.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.429
Heck, how in the world
he got hold of 600 pounds

07:44.431 --> 07:46.298
-of raspberries?
-I have no idea.

07:47.334 --> 07:51.036
<i> [jeremy] eighty miles west in</i>
<i> graham county, north carolina.</i>

07:51.038 --> 07:54.339
<i>  Mark and huck</i>
<i>  are rendezvousing</i>
<i>  with a local contact</i>

07:54.341 --> 07:57.375
<i>  who has a line on</i>
<i>  mass quantities of fruit.</i>

07:57.377 --> 07:59.211
<i> [mark] man, huck's</i>
<i>  trying to make some money.</i>

07:59.213 --> 08:02.447
Mike, from last year,
didn't make this much really.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.583
[huck]
oh, he's got the whole truck
weighted down ain't it.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.419
-Yeah, it's scrawny,
isn't it.
-Yeah.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.554
Usually raspberries
four or five six dollars

08:09.556 --> 08:11.656
for this little bitty box that
we know.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.326
<i>  If you get a chance to get</i>
<i>  some product like that free,</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:15.794
<i>  you better grab it.</i>

08:15.796 --> 08:18.230
-Hello, up there.
-Hello, mark.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.631
[mark]
let's see, what we got here?

08:19.633 --> 08:20.465
[grunts]

08:24.338 --> 08:25.937
what is it, is it jelly?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.239
It looks like jelly to me.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.645
But it's raspberry, sir.

08:33.647 --> 08:35.647
What do you think we're
making? Pancakes, is it?

08:36.550 --> 08:38.483
[huck] boy, I tell you what,
that's sweet.

08:38.485 --> 08:40.185
It wouldn't take
much sugar with it.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.020
That won't take much...

08:42.022 --> 08:44.389
Work to get it mashed
in either, would it.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.058
Well, it's already
broke down that for sure.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.095
Do you see bits
and pieces of berries
in there?

08:50.097 --> 08:51.463
[mark] well, it'll save us
a lot of work

08:51.465 --> 08:53.932
and save us some money
on the sugar too.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.234
How in the world would you get
six hundred pound

08:56.236 --> 08:58.103
uh, syrup like it?

08:58.105 --> 09:01.006
There's a food processing
plant that was closing down.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.173
They were gonna throw it out

09:02.175 --> 09:03.875
and I told 'em I knew a couple
of guys that might

09:03.877 --> 09:05.010
do something with it.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.012
I'd say we can do
something for this.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.513
[huck]
it'd be good on a basket,
wouldn't it?

09:08.515 --> 09:09.614
[mark] even more.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.118
<i>  I thought I was gonna</i>
<i>  have raspberry.</i>

09:13.120 --> 09:15.787
I've never mashed in
no syrup like this before.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.057
<i>  It ain't no tellin' how much</i>
<i>  liquor is for my</i>
<i>  frail bucket for.</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:21.459
<i>  It's got a real strong</i>
<i>  raspberry taste,</i>

09:21.461 --> 09:24.996
you know if it's real sweet,
they've put a lot of sugar in.

09:24.998 --> 09:28.400
<i>  So, we're gonna try to make</i>
<i>  the best drink it would make.</i>

09:28.402 --> 09:29.935
-[mark] thank you.
-Appreciate it, guys.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.503
-[mark] thank you.
-Good luck, buddy.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.319
[mark] all right,
we've got to go down
through here.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.322
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.892
<i> You know, 2020 was a difficult</i>
<i>  year for everybody,</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.927
<i>  but this year,</i>
<i>  things are looking up.</i>

09:55.929 --> 09:57.629
People are willing
to pay top dollar

09:57.631 --> 09:59.164
for a top-shelf product.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.100
Hell, man, might we'll just
get right in the damn
middle of it.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.535
<i> [mark] we've jumped in</i>
<i>  with both feet,</i>

10:03.537 --> 10:06.037
<i>  went all in on this</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey.</i>

10:06.039 --> 10:07.205
<i>  But the dilemma is,</i>

10:07.207 --> 10:09.140
we have to have
limestone water

10:09.142 --> 10:10.575
to make our tennessee whiskey.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.580
Damn, look right under.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.349
Oh, this is nice spot,
ain't it?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.385
That'd be ideal
right there to setup.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.421
<i> [mark] this water,</i>
<i>  even on the other side</i>

10:23.423 --> 10:25.023
<i>  of john's property line,</i>

10:25.025 --> 10:27.425
<i>  it's still full of little</i>
<i>  periwinkle snails.</i>

10:27.427 --> 10:30.095
It's still crystal clear.
It's still cold.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.529
<i>  So, at this point,</i>

10:31.531 --> 10:34.199
<i>  it simply went</i>
<i>  from being his water</i>

10:34.201 --> 10:35.800
<i>  to not being his water.</i>

10:35.802 --> 10:38.737
There's ain't nobody
I know for this part,

10:38.739 --> 10:42.607
but if I scroll over

10:42.609 --> 10:44.776
to the next piece property,
you know who it is?

10:45.912 --> 10:46.945
Rodney stinson.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.381
Uh-huh.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.548
Digger has got this

10:50.550 --> 10:53.284
little deal on his phone,
it's a property app.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.353
And you can see the property
line right through there.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.123
We do know someone
and he's a friend of ours.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.792
-He's got like 30 acres there.
-Yeah.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.361
But the water is not
on his property.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.698
-That's a hell of a way
to put some water in it.
-Yeah.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.299
I think it's
100 vertical feet.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.268
I'd say it's close.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.537
Well, if we're going to stay
after tennessee whiskey,

11:12.539 --> 11:14.539
I mean, this is given here.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.775
You know, not only
is it a pretty good clip

11:16.777 --> 11:18.476
as far as the crow flies even

11:18.478 --> 11:21.012
it's a lot of elevation
to overcome

11:21.014 --> 11:23.214
to be able to put water
on the other side.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.517
But if we're going to make
tennessee whiskey,

11:25.519 --> 11:28.119
we need to get the water
to rodney's property.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.621
Let's go get us
some grasshoppers.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.460
[mark]
let's go see what we can
find up here.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.363
<i> We followed the angus mountain</i>
<i>  spring water downstream</i>

11:38.365 --> 11:41.366
and we found a place that
we think would work,

11:41.368 --> 11:43.168
but we can't
setup still on it.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.036
You didn't know
who owned this, right?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.171
I don't know the people

11:46.173 --> 11:47.639
their last name
ain't from here.

11:47.641 --> 11:49.007
[digger]
<i>  you know, by and large,</i>

11:49.009 --> 11:52.277
if you know the names
of local last name,

11:52.279 --> 11:55.046
you feel a little comfortable
getting on somebody's
property.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.216
<i>  The majority of people that</i>
<i>  have been lifelong residents</i>
<i>  over here,</i>

11:58.218 --> 11:59.951
they, for the most part,
embrace it.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.953
I knew over here,

12:01.955 --> 12:05.156
but I never thought of him
for ain't no water
on his property.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.125
You know, rodney,
he's a good old boy,

12:07.127 --> 12:09.260
he's been a friend of ours
for decades.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.629
<i>  We don't feel the need</i>
<i>  really to ask him</i>

12:11.631 --> 12:13.798
<i>  permission to set up</i>
<i>  on his property.</i>

12:13.800 --> 12:15.033
I know he don't mind,

12:15.035 --> 12:18.203
and honestly, the less
he knows, the better.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.004
Then it don't put
him in a position

12:20.006 --> 12:21.106
<i>  to have to lie for us.</i>

12:21.108 --> 12:22.240
What do you think?

12:22.242 --> 12:25.176
I think right over here
is good and flat right here.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.012
I love the fact
stem down junk cars this year.

12:28.014 --> 12:28.980
Yeah, boy.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.683
[digger]
man, they've plenty of it.

12:31.685 --> 12:34.252
[mark] we can park here
amongst them and not
at his place.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.787
[digger] cover up there.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.388
<i>  You know, the big benefit</i>
<i>  of setting up</i>

12:37.390 --> 12:40.091
<i>  next to some old junk cars is</i>

12:40.093 --> 12:42.794
the copper still fits
right in the junk.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.530
You... You can't see
the forest for the trees,

12:45.532 --> 12:47.132
so to speak.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.534
Hey, first look
at this right here.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.036
-This here can be wrecked.
-This here can be wrecked
to dig it out.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.040
-I think right here
is the place.
-Yep.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.610
-[digger] hey...
-[mark] huh?

12:58.612 --> 13:01.980
How are you planning on
getting water over here?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.248
Well, I hadn't really

13:03.250 --> 13:04.849
went that far
in my thinking,

13:04.851 --> 13:08.620
but we got that water
I know it's gotta come
from over here.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.989
You know, my papa
had a little old thing

13:10.991 --> 13:12.924
that he put in the spring box.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.094
It was some sort of
pump that worked off

13:16.096 --> 13:19.063
the flow of the water comin'
out of the spring house.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.233
-Out of the spring--
-water pressure and volume.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.035
-Yeah.
-I saw one, uh,

13:24.037 --> 13:25.937
putting water to a cabin.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.105
-Ram pump.
-[mark] ram pump.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.173
-Yeah.
-[mark] that was it.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.642
I'd want to say rampart,
but that's something else.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.877
If we can figure out
how to get a pump in here,

13:32.879 --> 13:34.846
<i>  we can get water</i>
<i>  across this hill.</i>

13:34.848 --> 13:36.981
Once we get to
the top of the ridge,

13:36.983 --> 13:39.517
the rest of it's all
downhill so to speak.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.754
Well, what... What do we need
to do to investigate that?

13:42.756 --> 13:46.024
Well, I say, we go ask
our resident macgyver.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.058
Daniel may have heard
of one.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.793
You know, he's all
about mechanic.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.962
Oh, yeah. If anybody
can build one

13:50.964 --> 13:52.564
and make it work,
daniel maner can.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.765
Exactly.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.600
<i>  We keep daniel</i>
<i>  in our hip pocket</i>

13:55.602 --> 13:58.102
and the fact that he's
a hillbilly macgyver

13:58.104 --> 14:00.104
that don't hurt things a bit.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.441
This part is settled,
let's go,
hunt daniel and talk to him.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.053
[mike] come on, jerry.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.088
There are some pretty glass
ice bottles, aren't they?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.122
[jerry] sure is.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.891
Make pretty wine out of these.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.060
Our big idea is
to turn this blueberry wine

14:22.062 --> 14:23.962
<i>  into actual champagne.</i>

14:23.964 --> 14:25.096
[jerry] this process started.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.464
[mike] let's hold it
directly on top.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.633
-Are you ready?
-[jerry] try out.

14:28.635 --> 14:29.801
There you go.

14:29.803 --> 14:32.003
<i> [mike] this wine's delicious.</i>

14:32.005 --> 14:33.671
<i>  But we made it out</i>
<i>  of crushed up blueberries.</i>

14:33.673 --> 14:36.107
It's got a lot
of settlement particles,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.976
uh, blueberry holes.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.177
We gotta clear
this stuff up

14:39.179 --> 14:41.646
before we ever start
the process
of making champagne.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.248
[jerry] I'm doing good
this stuff right here is

14:43.250 --> 14:44.716
looking pretty doggone good.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.286
<i> [mike] we're gonna soften</i>
<i>  this blueberry mash</i>

14:48.288 --> 14:49.621
over into our other vessels

14:49.623 --> 14:51.322
and leave the settlement
in the barrel.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.957
Let's get them out.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.158
<i>  That's called racking.</i>

14:54.160 --> 14:57.362
You do that several times
to keep clearing up your wine.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.664
We're gonna take it
and catchin' these car, boys.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.567
And it will allow
all the particles inside of it

15:02.569 --> 15:04.269
to be able to fall
to the bottom.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.670
And we will take
the good clear stuff

15:05.672 --> 15:07.005
that's coming off the top

15:07.007 --> 15:09.274
and pump it off
into another container.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.376
Whatever is in the bottom
will pitch and then we'll pump

15:11.378 --> 15:13.144
into another one
and you let that one settle

15:13.146 --> 15:14.245
you pump it into another one.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.047
So, pull it off
that third time

15:16.049 --> 15:17.515
it'll be nice
and clean and clear.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.884
Then we can start
our champagne
process from there.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.020
All right, we got her.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.788
You ready to get out
of here of this step, brother?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.290
-Yeah.
-Then grab us a jug
and throw in there.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.392
Me and jerry,
we do just about everything

15:27.394 --> 15:28.893
under the sun in the woods.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.162
But there's sometime you've
got to get out of the woods

15:31.164 --> 15:33.464
to do certain types
of processes.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.801
That's going to be a lot
of good sparkling wine.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.569
<i>  Usually, when me</i>
<i>  and jerry make liquor,</i>

15:38.571 --> 15:39.971
we ferment it one time.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.339
<i>  If we're making</i>
<i>  this champagne,</i>

15:41.341 --> 15:43.141
<i>  we gotta go through</i>
<i>  a second fermentation,</i>

15:43.143 --> 15:45.810
keeping the right temperature
for this stuff to ferment.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.212
<i>  We're gonna go over</i>
<i>  here to a little garage</i>

15:48.214 --> 15:49.814
<i>  which we're gonna</i>
<i>  make our winery.</i>

15:49.816 --> 15:52.350
Our good friend gave us
permission to be here

15:52.352 --> 15:55.520
and we got access to regulate
the temperature in here

15:55.522 --> 15:57.188
and we're gonna start
this whole process

15:57.190 --> 15:58.456
tryna make some champagne.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.060
I guess,
our time here is done

16:02.062 --> 16:03.227
for right
this minute, ain't it?

16:03.229 --> 16:04.529
Yeah. I'll just let her sit

16:04.531 --> 16:06.030
-and do her thing.
-Yeah.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.398
Yeah, you know,
you just gotta be patient.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.600
You gotta let this wine sit
and let gravity do its work.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.235
<i>  Let it be still for a while.</i>

16:11.237 --> 16:13.104
Rack it over
into another vessel.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.406
Do the same process
several times back and forth

16:15.408 --> 16:17.108
so you can clear your wine up.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.110
That's a cool deal, player.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.812
Let her rest.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.723
[huck sighs] well,
I tell you what, mark.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.460
I've never seen
that much syrup one time.

16:35.462 --> 16:39.664
We got the several buckets
of good high quality
raspberry syrup.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.199
<i>  We're gonna try</i>
<i>  to make some high quality</i>

16:41.201 --> 16:42.767
liquor out of this.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.669
-[huck] I tell you,
it smells good.
-[mark] yeah.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.405
I tell we'll get more
flavor out of that

16:47.407 --> 16:49.207
blend something else with it.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.274
Better, we could sell it.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.444
Well, we could, uh...

16:53.446 --> 16:55.380
We could make ouselves
some lemonade

16:56.449 --> 16:58.316
flavor of that bumper with it
and run it through it

16:58.318 --> 16:59.717
and see what we come up with.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.886
I like a glass of lemonade.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.188
-How about you?
-I would like good lemonade?

17:04.190 --> 17:06.858
[huck] I know, people drink
raspberry lemonade.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.559
Why not do it moonshine?

17:08.561 --> 17:09.994
I know it'd be a good flavor.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.095
As the old timers
would say

17:11.097 --> 17:12.330
we could doctor it up
a little bit.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.166
We could get some real
raspberries, you know.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.634
Pretty, that's a little maybe.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.303
We can make it look good
and taste good there by.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.471
<i>  Fortified wine.</i>

17:20.473 --> 17:22.874
Everybody looked at it, said
something about the color,

17:22.876 --> 17:24.575
you know, say my...

17:24.577 --> 17:26.144
<i>  I have to sell it,</i>
<i>  I believe this could be</i>

17:26.146 --> 17:27.678
<i>  just the biggest hit</i>
<i>  to say it.</i>

17:28.782 --> 17:31.649
Raspberry lemonade moonshine.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.217
So, if we can get
mashed in, I guess,

17:33.219 --> 17:34.385
the quicker it'll go
to working.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.453
[mark] yeah.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.621
Heave it, heave it.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.592
You know, five three buckets
to the barrel.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.561
[huck] a big hit play star,
don't you?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.496
-Yeah.
-Yeah, 150 pound of syrup

17:45.498 --> 17:47.165
that's a lot of syrup.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.366
It'd take a big biscuit

17:48.368 --> 17:49.434
for it, I'll tell you that.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.804
That looks like color,
don't it?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.605
[huck] somebody ripped
an old pillar open.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.542
Throw it on top of raspberry
and feathered.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.444
[both laughing]

17:59.446 --> 18:01.913
we usually put, uh,
50 pound of sugar.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.181
About 20 pound's
all we need,

18:03.183 --> 18:05.049
-I believe, don't you?
-Yeah.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.984
Uh, these raspberries
are sweet,

18:06.986 --> 18:09.053
you can over sugar something,
you know, what?

18:09.055 --> 18:11.355
It take forever and ever
for it to work off.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.357
So, we figured we'd cut
the sugar in half

18:13.359 --> 18:15.059
<i>  and try that.</i>

18:15.061 --> 18:16.160
[huck] here comes the yeast.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.932
Oh, look at that turmoil.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.402
Grab that sheet there, uh,
must cap this off.

18:24.404 --> 18:28.139
We gonna get both these
barrels capped off,
getting them to work,

18:28.141 --> 18:31.709
and we're gonna make as much
moonshine as we can out of it.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.446
[huck] new year,
new products, new flavors.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.015
Let's take the
old farmer, ain't it?

18:38.852 --> 18:39.917
Yeah.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.022
-[daniel] we ain't
got no water?
-[digger] no.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.991
Uh. Bull [bleep].

18:46.993 --> 18:49.794
<i> [digger] well, as difficult as</i>
<i>  this endeavor has been,</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.195
it's getting more
and more difficult.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.798
We've got to have this water
to do what we need to do.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.175
-[mark] daniel?
-[daniel] yes, sir.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.077
The reason
we're bringing you here

19:06.079 --> 19:09.347
we gotta have this water
and we can't run no generator

19:09.349 --> 19:11.048
-or nothing here.
-[daniel] but this style
of pump

19:11.050 --> 19:12.950
all you're gonna hear
is a little flicker.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.920
<i> [digger] well, as difficult as</i>
<i>  this endeavor has been,</i>

19:15.922 --> 19:17.555
<i>  it's getting more</i>
<i>  and more difficult.</i>

19:17.557 --> 19:19.223
<i>  We're kind of maybe...</i>

19:20.126 --> 19:21.926
We might be trespassing
a little bit,

19:21.928 --> 19:23.828
but we're only
doing it temporarily.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.531
<i>  The water is just passing</i>
<i>  by them just like the areas</i>

19:26.533 --> 19:28.432
that somebody's gonna breathe
on the next property.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.001
So, what's wrong
with getting a little of it

19:30.003 --> 19:31.135
off their property

19:31.137 --> 19:33.337
before it gets away?
So, we're gonna build

19:33.339 --> 19:36.107
this ramp pump and try to get
it over this hillside here.

19:36.109 --> 19:39.076
You have to be a jack of all
trades to be among us, daniel.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.878
-Ain't top that and...
-You've... You've got to be

19:40.880 --> 19:43.414
a plumber,
a carpenter and everything.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.550
I don't mind.
That actually don't hurt.

19:45.552 --> 19:49.253
This water is one of a kind
and we have to have it.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.454
That looks good
the threading on it.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.523
Pop pop, we're ready to go.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.425
You know, digger
and I know nothing at all

19:54.427 --> 19:55.626
about a ramp pump.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.461
This is our fresh reservoir.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.931
That's one of the reasons
we enlisted old daniel.

19:59.933 --> 20:03.367
Well, this right here.
It's a hydraulic ramp pump.

20:03.369 --> 20:07.939
It'll take gravity fed water
going in this, into the pump

20:07.941 --> 20:12.009
and sandwater up through here,
up in this pressure reservoir.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.512
Higher pressure that's trapped
in this tank

20:14.514 --> 20:18.216
will push down on it
and send it out to the outlet

20:18.218 --> 20:20.451
and send it up the hill.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.221
Uh-huh, there you put
a foot on that, daniel.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.655
Put a big rock on it.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.157
Big ass rock.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.093
Now, rodney's property
starts at the top

20:29.095 --> 20:30.461
of the ridge back
here behind us.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.862
<i>  So, the way it lies,</i>

20:31.864 --> 20:34.098
<i>  we've gotta come out</i>
<i>  of this branch,</i>

20:34.100 --> 20:36.467
<i>  then get to the top</i>
<i>  of the hill.</i>

20:36.469 --> 20:39.604
<i> And pump water into reservoir,</i>
<i>  we're going to put up there.</i>

20:39.606 --> 20:42.106
<i>  If we can get</i>
<i>  to the top of that,</i>

20:42.108 --> 20:43.941
then we can make the water
go downhill,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.310
it's getting it to go up
the hill is the problem.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.346
<i>  We've got a pretty good task</i>
<i>  ahead of us.</i>

20:48.348 --> 20:51.482
<i>  It's gonna involve</i>
<i>  a lot of black pipe.</i>

20:51.484 --> 20:54.151
[daniel] this reminds me
of being a youngster

20:54.153 --> 20:55.786
<i>  in playland creek.</i>

20:55.788 --> 20:57.355
[mark] basically,
what we're doing is...

20:57.357 --> 20:58.155
[daniel] yeah.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.557
<i> [digger] this is...</i>

20:59.559 --> 21:03.461
<i>  Outrageously ridiculous</i>
<i>  to go to these measures</i>

21:03.463 --> 21:05.029
<i>  to do this.</i>

21:05.031 --> 21:07.031
But, at the end of the day,
this water

21:07.033 --> 21:09.533
has been scrutinized
by the best in the business.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.402
And it has been declared
the best water

21:11.404 --> 21:12.703
in the world at one point.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.138
We've gotta
have this water to do

21:14.140 --> 21:15.439
what we need to do.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.008
Well, here we go, boy.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.379
[daniel] we ain't got
no water?

21:21.381 --> 21:22.446
[digger] no.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.649
[daniel]
may take it in there.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.554
-Ain't no water coming in?
-[digger] uh-uh.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.024
Ah, bull [bleep]!

21:33.026 --> 21:35.026
Nothing, it's just water
flowing through

21:35.028 --> 21:37.161
nothing's happening,
no clicking, no,

21:37.163 --> 21:40.364
no sound of anything
going on inside of this pump.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.599
-[mark] damn it.
-[digger] damn it.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.301
[digger] we've got to get
this thing going, boys.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.702
We've got to be
getting some liquor made.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.270
We ain't doing it
spinning our wheels.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.819
Smells good.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.088
It does.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.089
Getting better.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.891
<i> [huck] this raspberry syrup,</i>

22:06.893 --> 22:08.993
we've never run
anything like this before.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.529
<i>  There's nothing in it</i>
<i>  but raspberries,</i>

22:11.531 --> 22:12.863
<i>  and sugar you know,</i>

22:12.865 --> 22:15.666
so, we're just going to have
to see how it turns out.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.934
Hope it tastes good,
don't you?

22:16.936 --> 22:18.069
[mark] yeah.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.271
<i>  We lost a lot</i>
<i>  of money last year.</i>

22:20.273 --> 22:23.207
<i>  Our fortified wine</i>
<i>  it's so good</i>

22:23.209 --> 22:26.210
but the more we can make
the more what you sell,

22:26.212 --> 22:28.045
the better we're going
to make it this winter.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.647
[huck] I guess we'd better
build us a farm and squeeze

22:29.649 --> 22:31.415
-some lemons, hadn't we.
-[mark] yeah, buddy.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.484
These big, fancy restaurants

22:33.486 --> 22:35.953
<i>  people get this</i>
<i>  raspberry lemonade.</i>

22:35.955 --> 22:38.055
You see the sweat
running down the glass

22:38.057 --> 22:39.824
<i>  really tastes good</i>
<i>  and looks good.</i>

22:39.826 --> 22:41.592
So, I think this run here,
will be a hit.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.330
We don't want to put
no lemons in that still.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.765
<i>  What we're gonna do is</i>

22:47.767 --> 22:50.935
<i>  put it in the pump</i>
<i>  it'll give us</i>
<i>  a lot more flavor.</i>

22:50.937 --> 22:53.104
[huck] well if we can't
sell that as liquor.

22:53.106 --> 22:54.939
We can open up
a lemonade stand.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.240
[mark laughs]

23:01.881 --> 23:03.614
well, here comes all
that warm, you know,

23:03.616 --> 23:04.949
<i>  the brandy that we run</i>

23:04.951 --> 23:08.786
should have a little bit of
a raspberry taste

23:08.788 --> 23:10.521
<i>  by putting this lemonade</i>
<i>  in the pumper</i>

23:10.523 --> 23:13.524
we'd be able to taste
both of them in it.

23:13.526 --> 23:16.460
Raspberry lemonade moonshine,
and I ain't never heard of it.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.596
Since we got the lemonade
in the thumper

23:18.598 --> 23:20.531
<i>  we gotta get her cap on,</i>

23:20.533 --> 23:22.066
<i>  get everything pasted up.</i>

23:22.068 --> 23:23.234
<i>  Hottest we got her now,</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:25.102
<i>  it shouldn't take too long,</i>
<i>  we'll be around it</i>

23:25.104 --> 23:26.570
and ready to start running.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.173
[huck] here it comes, mark.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.574
She started running out

23:30.576 --> 23:32.276
and we're throwing out
the heads

23:32.278 --> 23:34.645
and I'm gonna take me
a good little taste here.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.550
<i>  Good high proof, son,</i>
<i>  and I'll tell you that.</i>

23:39.552 --> 23:41.485
Its got a good flavor to it
right now.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.087
<i>  We'll be able to tell more</i>
<i>  about it</i>

23:43.089 --> 23:44.789
<i>  at the back end of the run.</i>

23:44.791 --> 23:46.123
Get her doctored up
just right,

23:46.125 --> 23:47.258
its gonna be good.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.793
Since all we got was syrup

23:49.896 --> 23:51.595
<i>  we went out and bought</i>
<i>  a bunch of raspberries.</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:53.364
We're going to soak
some of the raspberries

23:53.366 --> 23:56.333
in some of the high proof
liquor that first comes out.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.635
[huck] that's gonna
be pretty.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.869
[mark] it is pretty, ain't it?

23:59.005 --> 24:01.305
<i>  And then we're going</i>
<i>  to doctor yours</i>
<i>  after the fact.</i>

24:05.144 --> 24:06.544
I believe this is just
about done.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.514
[mark] all right, huck,
let's get to her.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.183
[huck] yeah, sell her,
let's go jar it up.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.384
[mark] that's right.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.519
<i>  I smell this back here</i>
<i>  it's dirt, mark.</i>

24:15.521 --> 24:17.655
You're going
to real, eh, markie?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.089
[huck] oh, would you try, one?

24:19.091 --> 24:21.358
Oh, oh, however you will.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.333
You take your breath, huck.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.603
[huck]
<i>  I'll tell you them berries</i>
<i>  right there,</i>

24:32.605 --> 24:34.205
they're high proof.

24:34.207 --> 24:36.040
That is strong, hoo!

24:36.042 --> 24:37.374
If you eat
one of 'em berries,

24:37.376 --> 24:39.210
lay it out of top
of that shine

24:39.212 --> 24:41.879
the grounds level is flat
meets you at in the face.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.447
Hey, how many berries
you want me to put in there?

24:43.449 --> 24:44.915
[huck] I'm gonna put
about four or five.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.084
<i> [mark] yeah, we're about</i>
<i>  thirty-six jars with us.</i>

24:47.086 --> 24:50.120
Oh, huck,
he's scooping them out
and he's laying it to it.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.556
-[mark] oh, that's pretty
though, ain't it.
-[huck] mmm-hmm.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.625
[mark] does that remind you
of being on the binge?

24:54.627 --> 24:56.327
I'm gonna place some
berries and lemons.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.229
<i>  I get them in there,</i>
<i> you know, what I'm looking at?</i>

24:58.231 --> 24:59.396
<i>  It looks real calm...</i>

24:59.398 --> 25:01.098
[bird chirping]

25:01.100 --> 25:03.100
<i>  ...Peaceful I guess</i>
<i>  you would say.</i>

25:03.102 --> 25:05.135
I mean it, it's pretty.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.104
[huck] mark first let's do
a taste test here.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.581
Don't burn.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.884
Perfect.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.319
-I can taste the
raspberries set that start...
-[huck] mmm-hmm.

25:22.321 --> 25:25.456
Little bit a heat in
the start and then you

25:25.458 --> 25:27.291
-breathe lemon.
-Tell you what,

25:27.293 --> 25:28.792
if a man had
a little bad cold

25:28.794 --> 25:30.528
or something
that right there
would be good.

25:31.497 --> 25:32.930
We wound up with 12 gallon,

25:32.932 --> 25:35.866
a good raspberry
lemonade moonshine.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.101
<i>  This is something different.</i>

25:37.103 --> 25:39.770
<i>  I think people would buy it</i>
<i>  and pay us good for it.</i>

25:39.772 --> 25:43.173
Turn it this way,
no the other way.
Like that.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.776
We still got to make
a whole lot of alcohol.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.444
-Say, lemonade.
-[huck] lemonade.

25:48.447 --> 25:51.482
We didn't really make
nothing last year, you know,

25:51.484 --> 25:53.117
we got to make some
money this year.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.385
[huck] well, it's got
a good taste.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.986
[mark] I will have no trouble
selling that.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.298
You ready to rock n roll,
my brother?

26:07.300 --> 26:08.666
All right,
let's get this done.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.034
I believe it's cleared
up quite a lot.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.669
It has, looks like it anyway.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.804
<i> [mike] this wine,</i>
<i>  we've let it sit.</i>

26:13.806 --> 26:15.906
Let the settlements
go to the bottom.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.474
<i> We're gonna siphon it up again</i>

26:17.476 --> 26:19.610
and leave the settlement
behind in the first vessels

26:19.612 --> 26:20.678
that we're pulling from.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.680
You ready?

26:25.084 --> 26:28.018
-Here we go.
-[jerry] let her roll.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.453
[mike] another time
we tell you about that,

26:29.455 --> 26:31.021
she'll be right won't it,
baby?

26:31.023 --> 26:32.790
[jerry]
right as rain, son.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.158
[mike]
<i>  man, this wine is beautiful,</i>

26:34.160 --> 26:36.460
<i>  I mean, it's got</i>
<i>  that blueberry color</i>

26:36.462 --> 26:37.895
almost like a beet juice,

26:37.897 --> 26:40.598
so to speak
a deep red mahogany color.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.899
You've look right here next...

26:41.901 --> 26:43.634
-You see it.
-See all the floaties
and stuff

26:43.636 --> 26:45.603
-close to the bottom.
-[mike] yes, sir, I see it.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.605
[jerry] yeah, that's what we
don't wanna get in to.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.540
We don't want to lose
the color and the good flavor

26:49.542 --> 26:52.209
of this wine by racking it
a thousand times.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.545
-That was done.
-Let's crack another.

26:54.547 --> 26:57.514
<i>  But we don't get all the</i>
<i>  yeast out racked off,</i>

26:57.516 --> 27:01.318
it can create hydrogen sulfide
which is that rotten egg smell

27:01.320 --> 27:03.087
and nobody wants
to drink a damn fart.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.388
I tell you what
if they wasn't kidding,

27:04.390 --> 27:05.923
this is a timely process.

27:05.925 --> 27:08.492
Yeah, it takes a long damn
time to do all this, don't it?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.227
[jerry] just racking it off
is gonna take time.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.329
If you want it to be right.
I guess we gotta

27:12.331 --> 27:14.965
take our time
and do it right. Right?

27:14.967 --> 27:17.101
-That's right. Right.
-[mike] right, right, sir.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.637
Once it is washed out.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.339
<i>  Last year everything</i>
<i>  come to a screaming halt.</i>

27:22.341 --> 27:25.976
This year, everything's
blowing up, going wide open.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.346
People can now afford
a good high end product.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.215
<i>  This is going to be</i>
<i>  something different</i>

27:31.217 --> 27:33.317
<i>  that people are gonna</i>
<i>  wanna get their hands on.</i>

27:33.319 --> 27:35.285
This is a fine champagne.

27:37.056 --> 27:40.424
[jerry] we'll just check these
and see exactly
what we got going on.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.092
<i> [mike] champagne should be</i>
<i>  right around</i>

27:42.094 --> 27:44.194
<i>  12% alcohol by volume,</i>

27:44.196 --> 27:47.031
<i>  but the wine itself</i>
<i>  needs to be about 10%</i>

27:47.033 --> 27:48.465
<i>  because the second</i>
<i>  fermentation</i>

27:48.467 --> 27:50.801
<i>  that makes our bubbles</i>
<i>  will only create</i>

27:50.803 --> 27:52.803
<i>  two more percent of abv.</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:54.238
When we mashed in
all these blueberries,

27:54.240 --> 27:57.408
we weren't really concerned
about the alcohol content

27:57.410 --> 27:59.176
<i>  because we're just going to</i>
<i>  run this through</i>

27:59.178 --> 28:00.511
<i>  and make a brandy out of it.</i>

28:00.513 --> 28:01.612
[jerry] what do you say?

28:02.682 --> 28:04.214
-Proof.
-Uh-huh.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.315
Fair to say.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.084
<i> [mike] we are at the moment</i>
<i>  of truth right now.</i>

28:07.086 --> 28:09.219
I'm just hoping, like
the bacon's, man this wine

28:09.221 --> 28:12.289
rate around 10% so we can
make this champagne work.

28:15.494 --> 28:16.527
About, five.

28:20.433 --> 28:21.498
About, five.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.502
This stuff set in 5%,
that is way too low.

28:27.473 --> 28:28.906
Over here...

28:28.908 --> 28:30.474
It looks like about eight.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.042
-About eight?
-Yeah.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.677
Yeah, I reckon you're right.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.979
You know, eight percent is
a lot damn closer

28:35.981 --> 28:38.015
to the ten percent
we need to be at.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.683
<i>  But still, I don't know</i>
<i>  what in the hell</i>

28:39.685 --> 28:41.085
we're gonna do
to make it work.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.657
We got good flavor
across the board.

28:46.659 --> 28:49.593
All we gotta do
is just add a little
fortification juice here.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.061
[mike] have it ready
to rock and roll.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.262
[jerry] where she needs to be.

28:52.264 --> 28:55.399
Jerry comes up with the idea
of putting some brandy

28:55.401 --> 28:57.401
<i>  that we've already</i>
<i>  run off of these blueberries</i>

28:57.403 --> 29:00.537
into this wine to bring it up
to the ten percent mark.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.639
[jerry]
so, what we're doing here
is we're actually adding our,

29:02.641 --> 29:04.208
our blueberry brandy

29:04.210 --> 29:06.276
to our blueberry wine.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.479
We're actually bringing
the abv up

29:08.481 --> 29:11.815
on our wine, so, it'll be like
a normal champagne

29:11.817 --> 29:13.083
abv would be.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.318
You know,
I'm not wild about

29:14.320 --> 29:16.086
putting brandy in
the champagne

29:16.088 --> 29:18.956
<i>  because we sold the brandy</i>
<i>  and the champagne separately.</i>

29:18.958 --> 29:20.491
<i>  That's more money</i>
<i>  in our pockets.</i>

29:20.493 --> 29:22.459
But because this wine
turned out so good,

29:22.461 --> 29:24.962
this gives me and jerry
a unique opportunity.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.897
[mike] oh, look at that
pretty stuff.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.599
We're going to bring something
very special

29:28.601 --> 29:29.767
and high end to the market.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.376
It's showing about 10 or 11.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.978
That's what we're looking for.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.513
If we got it just right,
you know, me and jerry,

29:42.515 --> 29:44.515
we don't wanna serve
weak champagne.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.216
<i>  We don't want people to say,</i>
<i>  you know, that's good,</i>

29:46.218 --> 29:48.452
but it's awful sweet.
There ain't no alcohol there.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.788
This ought to get it done
right here, jerry.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.689
<i> [mike] we want to give them</i>
<i>  a good little punch</i>

29:52.691 --> 29:54.658
when they take that swallow
out of that glass.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.861
That's blueberry champagne
with a good kick of alcohol.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.062
Cap that bad boy off.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.632
Let him set, let them settle.
We're ready for bottlin'.

30:01.634 --> 30:04.201
<i> [mike] next step,</i>
<i>  we've got to do</i>
<i>  our second fermentation.</i>

30:04.203 --> 30:06.436
We got to put our champagne
yeast in each bottle,

30:06.438 --> 30:07.638
a little extra sugar

30:07.640 --> 30:09.940
<i>  that brings the abv</i>
<i>  a little bit more,</i>

30:09.942 --> 30:11.575
but creates
the bubbles as well.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.076
Sounds good to me, bubby.

30:13.078 --> 30:16.046
Long, long down process,
but we're making it happen,
ain't we?

30:16.048 --> 30:17.748
[jerry] we've got it this
far, don't we?

30:28.994 --> 30:30.594
[digger] what do you think
city hatty boy?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.663
[mark] I say right up front
on the bank

30:32.665 --> 30:34.231
beside that tree.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.400
Easy, I can't see
where I'm going.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.435
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i>  it seemed like</i>
<i>  every time we turn around,</i>

30:38.437 --> 30:40.604
we're meeting with
a little bit of reverse force

30:40.606 --> 30:42.639
in this tennessee
whiskey endeavor.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.775
What do you say,
right here, all right?

30:44.777 --> 30:47.578
With this ramp pump,
the biggest problem is

30:47.580 --> 30:50.013
there's such a gradual
flow downstream.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.249
<i>  There's just not water</i>
<i>  pressure sufficient enough</i>

30:52.251 --> 30:53.383
<i>  to make this pump work.</i>

30:54.587 --> 30:56.887
<i>  But we've got</i>
<i>  an old reservoir.</i>

30:56.889 --> 30:59.323
We think this reservoir,
once it fills up,

30:59.325 --> 31:01.925
<i>  we're gonna put enough</i>
<i> pressure down on this to force</i>

31:01.927 --> 31:03.393
<i>  the water downstream</i>
<i>  a whole lot</i>

31:03.395 --> 31:04.928
<i> quicker and faster and harder.</i>

31:04.930 --> 31:07.965
So, that should get us where
we need to be on this pump.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.768
I know you didn't run in here
on your knuckles last night,

31:11.770 --> 31:13.937
-but I'm gonna
tell you anyhow.
-[daniel] yeah.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.172
We can't be, uh,

31:15.174 --> 31:16.607
dawdling around up here
too much.

31:16.609 --> 31:19.443
You're officially trespassing
right now.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.245
[mark] got 100 gallons
of water here

31:21.247 --> 31:22.446
with down pressure on it.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.181
So, we're hoping it will

31:24.183 --> 31:26.216
give us enough pressure
and volume down at

31:26.218 --> 31:28.085
the ramp pump
that we need.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.186
Let it go!

31:31.991 --> 31:33.290
[mark] we wanna see it
right here.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.359
There it goes.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.105
[digger] here we go.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.307
If everything works
the way it's supposed to,

31:50.309 --> 31:52.109
we'll see the lower
check valve

31:52.111 --> 31:55.679
close, which in turn will
force water out the outlet,

31:55.681 --> 31:57.948
which will in turn
go up the hill.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.383
So, that's what
we're hoping to see.

31:59.385 --> 32:02.519
[water bubbling]

32:05.057 --> 32:06.990
[digger] that's what
it's supposed to do,
ain't it, daniel?

32:06.992 --> 32:08.458
I'm thinking of validating...

32:08.460 --> 32:10.160
[daniel laughing]

32:10.162 --> 32:11.295
hell yeah.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.932
<i> [digger] we've got sufficient</i>
<i>  pressure and flow.</i>

32:14.934 --> 32:19.002
Now the task remains to see
if we can get this

32:19.004 --> 32:22.039
water pumped up over this hill
and into the reservoir.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.640
Hey, boys look at this
[bleep].

32:23.642 --> 32:24.908
-Look at here.
-[daniel] yeah.

32:24.910 --> 32:25.943
There she comes.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.878
[mark] son, that's a heck
of a stream.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.881
[digger] been to maine
to Spain, smoked dope,
chewed rope

32:30.883 --> 32:32.282
let's go to the [bleep]
market place

32:32.284 --> 32:34.051
and some still be
all I've ever seen.

32:36.922 --> 32:39.289
[mark] you're gonna
go up there or you want me
go up there.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.191
[digger] well, I'd love to go
through there,

32:41.193 --> 32:42.960
but you're a damn sight
younger than I am, dan.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.996
[daniel] well, that's
what I say. I'll go.
I don't care be it.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.698
[mark] we just won't go
get our tote set.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.134
We're going to put this
275 gallon tote

32:51.136 --> 32:52.436
at the top of the ridge.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.238
<i>  And then from</i>
<i>  the outlet side of it,</i>

32:55.240 --> 32:57.975
<i>  you know, it's all down hill</i>
<i>  from there to the still site.</i>

32:57.977 --> 32:59.309
[daniel] boy, that's you
making it down

32:59.311 --> 33:01.678
-the liquor.
-[digger] well, everybody,
does it.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.486
[daniel] now you go,
will you, man?

33:11.023 --> 33:13.223
Look at this, this barrel's...

33:16.295 --> 33:17.794
[bleep]

33:17.796 --> 33:20.564
[mark] inthe name
of goodness, it all--

33:20.566 --> 33:22.933
[digger] it ain't a strong-un,
but it's cold water.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.769
That's all we need,
the trickle.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.938
I bet it'd be pretty much
full overnight.

33:27.940 --> 33:30.374
I mean, that's consistent.
Look at that. Look at that.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.676
<i>  We had to go to</i>
<i>  all this trouble</i>

33:32.678 --> 33:35.045
because this is the best water
in the world

33:35.047 --> 33:36.880
and we certainly feel

33:36.882 --> 33:38.682
that it's worth it.
We have to have it.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.684
It's gonna do this
around the clock.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.452
We still got to get
the still site

33:42.454 --> 33:44.121
and everything built
mashed in.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.422
Time we're ready
to mash in,

33:45.424 --> 33:47.424
we'll have enough water
in here to mash in.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.693
[daniel] I bet it'll be
running over by then.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.105
-You ready to get them in
them champagne bottles, bubba?
-Yeah.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.774
<i> [mike] you know what,</i>
<i>  this wine is clearing up.</i>

34:03.776 --> 34:04.941
<i>  It's looking</i>
<i>  really, really good.</i>

34:04.943 --> 34:06.610
We racked this stuff
about three times.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.979
I believe it's ready to go
into the bottles now.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.914
[jerry] we've got this little
bottling tube

34:10.916 --> 34:13.116
and basically a little
check valve right here
on the end of this.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.619
So, when I push it down
the bottle
and hit the bottom,

34:16.522 --> 34:18.121
it starts to flow.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.290
And then when I pull it up,
it stops the flow.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.727
So, every bottle has almost
the same amount
of product in it.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.298
It doesn't take long to do,
does it?

34:28.300 --> 34:31.301
[mike] no, just a few seconds
and it's full.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.537
[jerry]
modern day inventions, huh?

34:33.539 --> 34:36.206
Any mountain shiner made

34:36.208 --> 34:37.441
champagne have they.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.408
No.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.410
I think many people has.

34:47.019 --> 34:49.786
[mike]
we've got 48 bottles of this
champagne bottled up,

34:49.788 --> 34:52.622
and now we've got to put
our champagne yeast

34:52.624 --> 34:54.491
and a little bit of more
sugar in each bottle

34:54.493 --> 34:56.460
and cap them off
with a bottle capper.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.462
Then we can ferment
under pressure which can,

34:58.464 --> 35:01.565
uh, creates your bubble effect
inside of the wine.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.136
<i>  A quarter of</i>
<i>  a teaspoon of sugar,</i>

35:06.138 --> 35:07.804
<i>  a quarter of a teaspoon</i>
<i>  of champagne yeast</i>

35:07.806 --> 35:08.905
<i>  to each bottle.</i>

35:08.907 --> 35:11.074
If it's not the right amount,

35:11.076 --> 35:13.143
it could not do
anything at all.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.611
It could come out perfect

35:14.613 --> 35:16.980
or you can start
exploding bottles.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.448
[jerry] the cork on a bottle
of champagne

35:18.450 --> 35:20.450
the bubble that comes out
and pressurizes it.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.551
That's the carbon dioxide.

35:21.553 --> 35:24.421
That's the result of the yeast
eating the sugar

35:24.423 --> 35:26.289
creating the
carbon dioxide gas.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.159
Can't wait to see these
damn bottles bubble up.

35:31.063 --> 35:33.230
<i>  You know, these caps that</i>
<i>  we're putting on this is just</i>

35:33.232 --> 35:34.564
<i>  strictly to be able to do</i>

35:34.566 --> 35:37.000
our fermentation process
under pressure.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.401
We're gonna get rid
of those caps.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.003
<i>  Then we'll put</i>
<i>  our regular cork</i>

35:40.005 --> 35:41.638
and our wire cage around it

35:41.640 --> 35:43.773
to keep the cork in place
and then it's ready to drink.

35:43.775 --> 35:44.975
[cell phone ringing]

35:45.611 --> 35:47.177
hello, sweetheart!

35:47.179 --> 35:48.311
<i> [jenna] hey, buddy.</i>

35:48.313 --> 35:49.513
What are you doin'?

35:50.382 --> 35:52.249
[jenna]
<i>  um, I've been looking online</i>

35:52.251 --> 35:54.851
<i>  at a few dresses,</i>
<i>  and I think I've found me...</i>

35:54.853 --> 35:56.086
<i>  Two.</i>

35:56.088 --> 35:58.488
<i>  Um, I think I need some help</i>
<i>  deciding though.</i>

35:58.490 --> 35:59.656
Okay, well

35:59.658 --> 36:01.491
it's whatever you want,
baby girl.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.026
[jenna]
<i>  and I found a few caterers.</i>

36:03.028 --> 36:05.262
<i>  I think, you know, that'll</i>
<i>  give us a really good deal.</i>

36:05.264 --> 36:07.063
[mike] that's cool,
that is great.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.132
Well, me and jerry,
we're actually

36:09.134 --> 36:11.334
in the middle of our...

36:11.336 --> 36:14.771
Second fermentation on
our blueberry champagne.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.706
[jenna]
<i>  oh, is that gonna be</i>
<i>  for the wedding?</i>

36:19.611 --> 36:20.810
What, uh...

36:20.812 --> 36:22.479
-Well--
-for the wedding?

36:29.488 --> 36:32.255
I'll need a good bath
after all this, I'm sticky.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.090
[mark speaking]

36:35.294 --> 36:37.194
[huck] that is a good brush.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.296
[mark speaking]

36:41.099 --> 36:43.066
-[huck] shoo!
-[mark laughing]

36:43.068 --> 36:44.935
now you can use
that for other things.

36:44.937 --> 36:47.704
You know, when them chiggers
get all over you, scratch...

36:47.706 --> 36:50.774
[mark speaking]

36:54.980 --> 36:56.947
-[huck] yeah!
-[both laughing]

36:56.949 --> 36:59.649
-all right, go!
-[both laughing]

37:01.353 --> 37:03.286
[jenna]
<i>  oh, is that gonna be for</i>
<i>  the wedding?</i>

37:03.288 --> 37:04.354
What, uh...

37:04.356 --> 37:05.622
-Well--
-[jerry] for the wedding?

37:06.625 --> 37:08.358
You know, jenna,
she is very particular

37:08.360 --> 37:10.060
about what she wants
for the wedding.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.062
<i>  I really wasn't planning on</i>
<i>  using the champagne,</i>

37:12.064 --> 37:14.564
but happy wife, happy life,
right?

37:14.566 --> 37:15.932
Yeah, baby, yep, yep.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.834
That's going to be the
champagne for the wedding.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.502
Let me let you go
for a minute.

37:19.504 --> 37:22.105
I need to talk to jerry here.
Okay, love you.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.473
[jenna]
<i>  love you, bye.</i>

37:24.810 --> 37:26.376
You know, me and,
me and jenna has been

37:26.378 --> 37:28.144
engaged for a long time.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.280
-Quite a long time.
-Yeah.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.982
But we finally,

37:31.984 --> 37:34.351
you know, settled on a date
to get married.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.052
-Really?
-Yeah, yep.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.555
-Man, that's awesome.
-Yeah, we're fixing and doin'
the thing, brother.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.423
-That's for sure.
-Chicken dinner for you, man.

37:40.425 --> 37:41.491
-Yeah.
-Hell, yeah.

37:41.493 --> 37:42.592
Well, you got to be there.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.893
I know, that's what
I'm sayin'.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.161
You've just been
waiting on a date.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.363
-Waiting on the date.
-[mike laughs]

37:46.365 --> 37:47.530
you told me,
it's gonna to happen.

37:47.532 --> 37:49.566
Yeah, I knew how
excited she is, ain't she?

37:49.568 --> 37:51.234
We can definitely spare
you a couple of bottles

37:51.236 --> 37:52.602
for the, for the toast.

37:52.604 --> 37:55.005
Well, I was thinking
more like, you know,

37:55.007 --> 37:56.506
maybe at least half.

37:56.508 --> 37:57.974
You know,
we're looking to have

37:57.976 --> 37:59.809
at least a 100 guests
at our wedding.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.479
<i>  If everybody's going to get</i>
<i> toast or two of this champagne</i>

38:02.481 --> 38:04.948
<i>  man, I'm gonna need</i>
<i>  at least half</i>
<i>  of these rack sitting here.</i>

38:04.950 --> 38:06.383
This is, uh...

38:06.385 --> 38:09.519
In most cases a once
in a lifetime deal,

38:09.521 --> 38:10.854
like, the fourth for me.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.355
This is the...

38:12.357 --> 38:14.524
The last in the lifetime
deal for me.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.660
-And, uh...
-All right, I tell you what.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.195
We can take one half of it
for the wedding

38:19.197 --> 38:20.797
-under one condition.
-What's that?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.266
You have to find us a buyer

38:23.268 --> 38:25.402
to buy the rest of it
at a higher price.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.469
If we got to get double,

38:26.471 --> 38:28.605
at least double out
of the other half.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.507
<i> [mike] you know, jerry is kind</i>
<i>  of challenging me</i>

38:30.509 --> 38:32.976
to sell the other half
of the champagne,

38:32.978 --> 38:35.211
the one that we're
not taken to the wedding

38:35.213 --> 38:37.213
for double
the price on the bottle

38:37.215 --> 38:38.715
<i>  to get the same profit.</i>

38:38.717 --> 38:40.216
You know what we're
going to have to find?

38:40.218 --> 38:42.519
We gonna have to find
that one damn man.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.088
That one damn rich
high roller.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.290
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll put it out there.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.692
I'll try to find
the buyer, man.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.226
Let me try to put some money
in our pocket.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.361
You know, the type of customer

38:51.363 --> 38:53.396
you're looking for to
buy a good champagne

38:53.398 --> 38:54.364
is somebody don't mind

38:54.366 --> 38:55.932
spending money
on a good product.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.634
<i>  You know, I've got to find</i>
<i>  the customer now</i>

38:57.636 --> 38:59.769
that's willing to pay
that kind of price
for the champagne.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.938
-I'll take the challenge
I don't care.
-All right.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.391
[mark] here we go?

39:22.761 --> 39:24.461
Kelley, I wanna bring you up

39:24.463 --> 39:27.964
to speed on some stuff that
you ain't got a clue about.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.566
On the other end of this hose

39:29.568 --> 39:31.668
is angus mountain
spring water.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.436
Boy, as good as it
gets right there, bud.

39:33.438 --> 39:35.472
It's the best water
in the world.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.140
<i>  We're bringing kelley</i>
<i>  and daniel in,</i>

39:37.142 --> 39:39.109
to help with the
tennessee whiskey.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.511
<i>  We finally got us</i>
<i>  still site set up</i>

39:41.513 --> 39:44.381
with a great source
of limestone water.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.649
<i>  So, by bringing in</i>
<i>  daniel and kelley,</i>

39:46.651 --> 39:47.884
<i>  we can run in shifts</i>

39:47.886 --> 39:50.320
and basically double
our production.

39:50.322 --> 39:53.857
All right, boys,
there is a taste bucket,
yeast.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.593
Amylase enzyme, that's
an important ingredient.

39:56.595 --> 40:00.163
Corn fill that rascal up
three times to that point.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.799
Barley one time on each one
of these each barrel,

40:02.801 --> 40:04.934
rye, to right there just once.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.736
-Is everybody on board?
-Yes, sir.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.172
Barley.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.208
Once we get daniel and kelley
trained up on this recipe...

40:12.210 --> 40:14.043
You dip a bucket
and I'll dip a scoop.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.312
Let's scoop, scoop
we'll get it.

40:16.314 --> 40:19.282
And we see they're ready
to run with it by
their selves.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.984
<i>  We're going to run</i>
<i>  as much as this</i>

40:20.986 --> 40:24.020
tennessee whiskey as we can
as often as we can.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.356
Let's get some water hot
let's make some mash.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.059
To say this, tennessee whiskey
has been an uphill battle

40:30.061 --> 40:31.094
been an understatement.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.496
<i>  We faced obstacle</i>
<i>  after obstacle.</i>

40:33.498 --> 40:35.765
Now, we feel like we've got
all that out of the way.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.200
We're going to get busy.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.369
-We're ready to start
pumping water.
-All right.

40:39.371 --> 40:40.503
Ignition.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.143
[digger] got any lumps
down there, you feel?

40:47.145 --> 40:49.279
I still got a dam
in the bottom of it,

40:49.281 --> 40:51.214
-I'm getting out there.
-There you go.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.349
[cell phone ringing]

40:53.351 --> 40:54.451
yello!

40:54.453 --> 40:55.985
<i> [killer beaz] hey man,</i>
<i>  what are you doing?</i>

40:55.987 --> 40:57.387
[digger] what's up beaz?

40:57.389 --> 41:00.190
[killer beaz]
<i>  um, it's been six months</i>

41:00.192 --> 41:02.058
<i>  since we placed that order</i>

41:02.060 --> 41:04.661
<i>  for the hundred gallons</i>
<i>  of the tennessee whiskey.</i>

41:04.663 --> 41:06.663
You know, toward the end
of last season,

41:06.665 --> 41:08.364
when we finally dialed in
the recipe,

41:08.366 --> 41:11.000
<i>  we promised killer beaz</i>
<i>  100 gallons</i>

41:11.002 --> 41:14.003
of aged tennessee whiskey
in a six months.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.406
Now, I don't know if
time's moving faster

41:16.408 --> 41:18.374
or if I'm moving slower,

41:18.376 --> 41:20.310
but six months has passed so

41:20.312 --> 41:21.945
<i>  it's time to get it to doing.</i>

41:21.947 --> 41:23.613
[killer beaz]
<i>  can I come get that?</i>

41:23.615 --> 41:25.181
[digger]
okay, well, here's the deal.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.950
We had to take it
to the east coast

41:26.952 --> 41:28.952
to put it on a boat.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.220
[killer beaz]
<i>  you did what?</i>
