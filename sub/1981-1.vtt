00:41.041 --> 00:44.543
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence...

00:44.627 --> 00:46.628
they have been
regarded with fear...

00:46.713 --> 00:49.798
suspicion, often hatred.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.134
Across the planet, debate rages.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.637
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain...

00:55.722 --> 00:58.140
or simply a new species
of humanity...

00:58.224 --> 01:01.310
fighting for their share
of the world?

01:01.394 --> 01:04.396
Either way,
it is an historical fact:

01:04.480 --> 01:08.984
Sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.278
"We are not enemies, but friends.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.280
"We must not be enemies.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.282
"Though passion
may have strained...

01:57.367 --> 02:00.619
it must not break the bonds
of our affection. "

02:00.703 --> 02:05.833
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.418
It's one of my favorites.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.586
So, if you’ll please
have your tickets ready...

02:10.672 --> 02:12.673
we can begin the tour.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.390
Jackie, could you clear
my schedule this evening?

02:21.516 --> 02:24.393
I wanna have dinner with
my son. Yes, Mr. President.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.090
Excuse me, sir.
Are you lost?

03:04.809 --> 03:07.436
Perimeter breach
at visitor's checkpoint.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.567
Multiple subjects.

03:13.651 --> 03:18.447
Mr. President, security breach. Jackie,
leave. Let's get him out to the car.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.201
Exit's not clear. We don't
know how many there are.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.286
Post five. Secure.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.089
- There's something in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.342
Negative! Not clear!

03:43.514 --> 03:47.017
- It's outside the oval office.
- Lock this place down!

04:04.077 --> 04:06.328
- Don't shoot!
- There!

04:31.479 --> 04:32.854
My God.

07:12.557 --> 07:16.226
Neanderthals. We once believed
that they were wiped out...

07:16.310 --> 07:19.896
by years of conflict with a much
more advanced branch of humanity...

07:19.981 --> 07:21.898
called Cro-Magnon man.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.900
But recent research
into our own DNA...

07:23.985 --> 07:27.654
suggests that these two species
may have interbred...

07:27.738 --> 07:30.490
evolving into modern humans.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.492
In other words, into what?
Us.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.537
Us. Right.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.498
Artie, not here.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.923
Come on.
Pay attention.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.940
Makes me insane
when she does this.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.736
What are you looking at, you sick—

08:07.820 --> 08:10.155
Busted my lip.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.199
- I have cancer.
- To the shelter!

08:12.283 --> 08:14.117
- No!
- Hi.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.078
They're gonna kill—

08:17.163 --> 08:19.623
What's wrong with this?
It doesn't work.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.213
Jean? You okay?
Yeah.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.965
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.927
It's just, uh—
just a headache.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.306
It's not just a headache,
is it?

08:36.390 --> 08:39.308
Listen, I— I wasn't really
sure how to say this...

08:39.434 --> 08:42.270
but ever since Liberty
Island, you've been— Scott.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.314
You've been different.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.274
My telepathy's been off lately.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.778
I can't seem to focus. I can hear
everything. It's not just your telepathy.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.740
A month ago, you had to concentrate just to
levitate a book or a chair across the room.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.618
Now, when you have a nightmare,
the entire bedroom shakes.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.831
My dreams are getting worse.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.000
Scott.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.630
I keep feeling something terrible
is about to happen.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.681
I would never let anything
happen to you.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.642
Hey. Have you guys
seen Bobby and Rogue?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.479
Something's happening
in the food court.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.065
My brother asked you a simple
question. Why are you being such a dick?

09:27.149 --> 09:29.150
Yeah, why are you
being such a dick?

09:29.235 --> 09:32.904
Because I can.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.990
Can I have a light?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.119
Hmm.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.246
- Sorry. I can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.707
- Why don't
you stop showing off?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.918
For her? I can't help it if your
girlfriend's getting excited.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.796
- I don't think she's getting excited.
- Trying to have a good time.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.465
I think you're the only one
having a good time.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.385
Hey!

09:55.511 --> 09:58.346
That's real cute, man.
What are you gonna do?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.059
Suddenly,
you're not so tough.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.054
Hello? Honey, can you hear me?

10:47.730 --> 10:50.607
Bobby, what did you do?

10:50.733 --> 10:53.109
I didn't do this.
No.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.528
I did.

11:03.579 --> 11:07.624
And the next time you
feel like showing off, don't.

11:10.211 --> 11:15.173
Breaking news. We're coming
to you live from Washington...

11:15.257 --> 11:18.051
where there's been an attack in
the Oval Office of the White House.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.595
Details are still coming in,
but we have been informed...

11:20.680 --> 11:23.598
that the president and
vice-president were not harmed.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.267
Sources say the attack
involved one or more mutants.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.395
I think
it's time to leave, Professor.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.231
Authorities have closed off-
I think you're right.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.779
Yearrgh! Unh!

11:41.617 --> 11:44.285
My opinion?
Magneto's behind this.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.287
No. I don't
think so, Scott.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.332
While Eric is capable of organizing
something like this from prison...

11:49.417 --> 11:51.334
for him
it would be irrational.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.336
It would only hurt his goal
of mutant prosperity.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.880
You mean superiority.
You're right.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.634
- If Eric had his way—
- Of course, you know how the government will respond.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.886
They'll reintroduce
the Registration Act.

12:01.971 --> 12:06.141
Or worse. The president could
declare a state of emergency.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.727
Place every mutant
in the country under arrest.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.895
Do you think the assassin
was working alone?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.399
Well, we'll only know that if we
find him before the authorities do.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.651
I've been trying to
track him using Cerebro...

12:16.736 --> 12:21.239
but his movements
are inexplicably erratic.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.867
When I have
more exact coordinates...

12:23.951 --> 12:27.036
Storm, Jean, I'll need you to take
the jet and try and pick him up.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.417
It was close, wasn't it?

12:32.501 --> 12:35.378
Closer than anyone's admitted.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.089
What do you need, William?
Just your authorization...

12:38.174 --> 12:40.467
for a special operation.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.429
Uh, no, thank you,
Mr. President.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.265
And somehow I thought you were
here to talk about school reform.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.642
Funny you should say that,
Mr. President.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.229
Senator.
Mr. President.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.941
- Thank you for having me.
- Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.737
- How do you do?
- His department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon...

13:00.821 --> 13:03.281
since before my time.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.534
As I recall, you were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act, Senator.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.871
It seems your ideas on the mutant
problem have changed recently.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.123
For the best,
I hope.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.126
So, what are you proposing,
Mr. Stryker?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.504
Uh, may I,
Mr. President?

13:30.518 --> 13:34.103
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility...

13:34.188 --> 13:37.607
in the Salem region
of upstate New York.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.651
Where did you
get this information?

13:39.735 --> 13:42.320
Interrogation of one of
the mutant terrorists...

13:42.404 --> 13:44.447
from the Liberty Island
incident.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.908
Eric? Eric Lehnsherr?

13:47.034 --> 13:50.161
You have access to him?
Magneto. Yes.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.414
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.297
- This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.262
What the hell is that?
Ajet.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.473
- What kind of jet?
- We don't know...

14:10.558 --> 14:15.144
but it comes up
out of the basketball court.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.529
If we’d been allowed to do our jobs,
Mr. President, before this incident—

14:24.613 --> 14:26.948
All right. Listen.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.246
William, you enter,
you detain, you question...

14:33.330 --> 14:35.582
but the last thing
we need to see...

14:35.666 --> 14:38.585
is the body of a mutant kid
on the 6:00 news.

14:47.177 --> 14:49.304
Mr. Stryker.
Senator Kelly.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.558
This is Yuriko,
my personal assistant.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.603
Quite a handshake.
What can I do for you?

14:56.687 --> 15:00.440
Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison. I'd
like to arrange a visit if possible.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.567
It isn't a petting zoo,
Senator.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.569
In this conflict,
he is the enemy.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.906
You're just a spectator. So why
don't you sit this one out, all right?

15:07.990 --> 15:12.410
Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

15:17.249 --> 15:20.418
I was piloting black-ops missions
in the jungles of North Vietnam...

15:20.502 --> 15:23.755
while you were sucking on your
mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.757
Don't lecture me
about war.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.009
This already is a war.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.522
You're dead. You're so dead.
You're dead.

15:46.695 --> 15:48.863
I—I don't
wanna hurt you.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.951
I'm not afraid.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.995
Hey.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.721
Logan!
It's Logan.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.100
You miss me, kid?

16:17.226 --> 16:19.519
Not really.
Mm. How you doing?

16:19.645 --> 16:22.063
I'm okay. How are you? Who's this?

16:22.147 --> 16:25.400
Oh, this is Bobby. He's
my— I'm her boyfriend.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.902
Call me Iceman.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.158
Right.
Boyfriend?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.577
So how do you guys—

16:36.662 --> 16:39.872
Well, we're still
working on that.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.917
Look who's come back.
Just in time.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.254
For what?
We need a baby-sitter.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.841
Baby-sitter? Nice to
see you again, Logan.

16:49.925 --> 16:54.429
- Hi, Logan.
- Hi, Jean.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.182
Uh, I should go
and get the jet ready.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.768
Yeah, well,
it was good to meet you.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.937
Come on. Let's go. Bye, Logan.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.897
I'll see you later.
- Okay.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.113
Storm and I
are heading to Boston.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.115
We won't be gone long.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.452
The professor wants us to track down
a mutant who attacked the president.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.454
So it was a mutant?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.539
You'll be here
when we get back—

17:21.623 --> 17:24.541
unless you plan
on running off again.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.629
Well, I can probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.592
Find what you were
looking for, Logan?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.635
More or less.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.430
I'll see you boys later.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.224
- Be safe, okay?
- You too.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.852
- Bye.
- See ya.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.648
Aren't you gonna
welcome me home?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.903
Your bike needs gas.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.155
Then fill her up.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.718
Mr. Laurio.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.720
How long
can we keep this up?

18:19.807 --> 18:22.016
How long is your sentence?

18:22.142 --> 18:25.561
Forever. Not necessarily
forever, Mr. Lehnsherr.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.064
Just until
I've got all that I need.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.274
Mr. Stryker.
How kind of you to visit.

18:30.359 --> 18:36.072
Have you come back to make sure the
tax-payers' dollars are keeping me comfortable?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.869
Ohh!

19:00.556 --> 19:03.599
Done. You can go.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.937
Now...

19:10.732 --> 19:12.900
Mr. Lehnsherr...

19:16.071 --> 19:18.531
I'd like to have one final talk...

19:18.615 --> 19:21.284
about the house
that Xavier built...

19:21.368 --> 19:24.453
and the machine
called Cerebro.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.507
Logan, my tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding...

19:36.592 --> 19:40.386
continue smoking that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days...

19:40.470 --> 19:42.722
under the belief that
you're a six-year-old girl.

19:42.806 --> 19:46.851
- You'd do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.812
Welcome back.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.741
Ooh.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.999
You want me to leave?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.627
No. Just don't move.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.345
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.309
White lights are humans.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.731
And these
are the mutants.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.945
Through Cerebro,
I'm connected to them.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.197
And they to me.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.285
You see, Logan...

20:46.370 --> 20:48.621
We're not as alone
as you think.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.376
I found the base
at Alkali Lake.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.462
There was
nothing there.

20:56.546 --> 21:01.300
The broken line represents the path of
the mutant who attacked the president.

21:01.385 --> 21:05.137
I've been finding it difficult
to get a lock on him.

21:05.222 --> 21:08.599
Well, can't you just
concentrate harder?

21:08.684 --> 21:11.227
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.856
There.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.484
Looks like
he's finally stopped running.

21:34.042 --> 21:36.460
I need you
to read my mind again.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.423
Logan...

21:46.555 --> 21:49.515
I'm afraid the results
will be the same as before.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.978
- We had a deal.
- The mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked and opened.

21:54.062 --> 21:58.190
- It's a beehive with a million different compartments.
- Spare me the lecture.

21:58.275 --> 22:02.403
I have no doubt that your amnesia,
your adamantium skeleton, the claws...

22:02.487 --> 22:04.405
are all somehow connected.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.407
But, Logan...

22:06.491 --> 22:11.454
sometimes the mind needs to
discover things for itself.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.165
I promise you we'll
talk again when I return.

22:14.249 --> 22:19.420
Oh. If you will be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight...

22:19.504 --> 22:22.173
Scott and I are going to
visit an old friend.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.857
I'm sending coordinates of where the
mutant seems to have settled for now.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.610
Soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.612
Let's hope
he cooperates.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.531
Yes. For his sake.
Good luck.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.642
Stryker, William.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.085
What are you
doing in here?

25:46.169 --> 25:49.338
Estoy tirando la basura.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.507
Garbage.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.515
These are
the coordinates.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.745
He's a teleporter.

27:02.829 --> 27:06.832
- Must be why the professor
had trouble locking onto him.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.586
We're not here to hurt you!

27:11.713 --> 27:13.631
We just wanna talk!

27:18.970 --> 27:21.722
- Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.224
Sure you don't wanna come down?

27:47.082 --> 27:50.417
- You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.795
Are you?

27:52.879 --> 27:55.214
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.758
Now why would people
have gotten that impression?

27:59.052 --> 28:03.097
What's your name?
Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.853
There was so much shooting...

28:09.938 --> 28:11.855
such fear...

28:11.940 --> 28:13.941
and then
there was only pain.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.946
I could see it all happening...

28:19.030 --> 28:21.532
but I couldn't stop myself.

28:21.616 --> 28:24.118
It was like a bad dream.

28:25.161 --> 28:27.955
Perhaps He is testing me.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.876
And before you were
in the White House...

28:32.961 --> 28:34.878
what do you remember?

28:34.963 --> 28:37.923
Nothing. I was here.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.928
Jean.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.098
I'd rather get him
back to the professor.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.975
The professor?

28:53.064 --> 28:55.649
Did you do these yourself?

28:56.693 --> 28:58.694
Yes.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.951
And what about this?

29:26.306 --> 29:28.223
I need you
to read my mind again.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.684
I'm afraid the results
will be the same as before.

29:30.810 --> 29:33.020
He'll be indestructible.
His entire skeleton—

29:33.146 --> 29:38.525
Adamantium. Sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

29:38.651 --> 29:42.446
Wolverine.

29:42.530 --> 29:45.157
No memory. He'll have no memory.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.213
A dozen tourists in
the White House during the attack...

29:59.297 --> 30:01.215
are still being
held for questioning.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.676
Best tasting food.
A machine that's so darn easy—

30:07.430 --> 30:09.223
...president will
address the nation—

30:14.687 --> 30:17.773
For the White House assassin,
following hundreds of-

30:17.857 --> 30:19.358
Can't sleep?

30:20.860 --> 30:24.196
- How can you tell?
- 'Cause you're awake.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.491
Right. How about you?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.785
I don't sleep.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.876
Hey.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.962
Doesn't anybody
sleep around here?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.047
Apparently not.

30:43.216 --> 30:46.885
Got any beer?
This is a school.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.887
So that's a "no"?
Yeah, that's a "no. "

30:48.972 --> 30:50.889
Got anything other
than chocolate milk?

30:50.974 --> 30:54.101
There should be some soda
in that small cupboard.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.242
Thanks.
No problem.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.003
I'll take him from here.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.882
It's all right, Scott.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.509
Nice shades.
Thanks.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.417
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

32:00.501 --> 32:02.377
Sorry, Eric. Not today.

32:02.462 --> 32:05.339
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

32:08.009 --> 32:10.093
The assassination attempt
on the president—

32:10.219 --> 32:13.263
What do you know about it? Nothing.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.641
Only what I read
in the papers.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.353
You really shouldn't
have to ask, Charles.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.688
What's happened to you?

32:21.773 --> 32:25.275
I've had frequent visits
from William Stryker.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.195
You remember him,
don't you?

32:29.322 --> 32:31.615
William Stryker.

32:31.699 --> 32:35.994
His son, Jason, was once a
student of yours, wasn't he?

32:36.079 --> 32:38.121
Yes. Years ago.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.959
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to help him...

32:42.043 --> 32:44.294
at least not in the way
that his father wanted.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.797
And now you think
that taking in the Wolverine...

32:46.881 --> 32:50.509
will make up for your failure
with Stryker's son.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.724
How long you been here?
Couple years.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.978
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

33:02.647 --> 33:06.775
Actually, my parents
think this is a prep school.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.945
Oh, I see.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.699
I suppose lots of prep schools have
their own dorms, campuses— Jets.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.079
So you and Rogue, huh? Yeah.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.249
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just—

33:23.710 --> 33:25.919
It's just that it's not easy...

33:26.004 --> 33:28.296
when you wanna be
closer to someone...

33:29.757 --> 33:32.300
but you can't.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.722
You know, I've seen how
you look at Dr. Grey.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.601
Excuse me?
Nothing.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.229
You haven't told him
about his past, have you?

33:44.313 --> 33:46.523
I've put him on the path.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.192
Logan's mind is still fragile.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.278
Is it?

33:51.362 --> 33:54.948
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men...

33:55.033 --> 33:57.117
old friend?

34:00.496 --> 34:02.622
Eric, what have you done?

34:04.584 --> 34:06.585
I'm sorry, Charles.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.297
I couldn't help it.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.425
What have you told Stryker?

34:15.719 --> 34:17.637
Everything.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.812
The war has begun.

34:30.818 --> 34:35.822
Scott! You should've killed
me when you had the chance!

35:09.524 --> 35:11.566
But now and then...

35:11.651 --> 35:13.610
every mother needs to get away.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.947
Without her,
the babies are helpless.

35:17.031 --> 35:21.409
Sensing danger,
the mother rat races home.

35:21.494 --> 35:24.871
The babies can't
even see the killer.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.999
And someone uninvited
is coming to dinner.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.462
She arrives too late
for one baby.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.507
The centipede was deadly.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.177
Hi.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.029
- What is it?
- Shh, shh.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.941
You picked
the wrong house, bub.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.815
You all right?

37:26.160 --> 37:27.118
Stay here.

37:36.712 --> 37:39.214
Come on!
Run!

38:04.699 --> 38:07.492
Move, move, move!

38:14.750 --> 38:16.626
This way.
Let's go. Come on!

38:22.842 --> 38:24.718
Go, go, go!

38:31.434 --> 38:34.227
Run!

38:34.353 --> 38:36.855
Run! John! Hey. Where's Rogue?

38:36.981 --> 38:39.649
I don't know.
I gotta find her.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.234
Hey!

38:42.486 --> 38:44.904
Come on!
Here. Take her.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.157
Hurry!

38:50.453 --> 38:53.079
Go on. Get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.081
Come on.
Let's go! Come on!

38:57.918 --> 39:00.879
Hey. Take him.
He's stunned.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.964
I can help you.
Help them.

39:25.946 --> 39:27.864
Rogue!
Bobby!

39:27.948 --> 39:29.949
This way.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.005
Come on. Everybody,
follow me up here.

39:50.179 --> 39:52.931
Move! Move!
Go! Go!

40:00.606 --> 40:02.607
Come on.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.873
Let's go.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.835
Come on. This way.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.634
This is it.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.846
Logan!

40:32.930 --> 40:34.889
You wanna shoot me?
Shoot me!

40:34.974 --> 40:37.016
Don't shoot him!

40:37.101 --> 40:39.352
Not yet.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.897
Wolverine?

40:42.982 --> 40:45.358
Well, I must admit, this is
certainly the last place...

40:45.443 --> 40:47.694
I'd expect to find you.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.530
How long has it been?
Fifteen years?

40:51.699 --> 40:54.033
You haven't
changed one bit.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.495
Me, on the other hand—

40:59.832 --> 41:01.833
Nature.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.340
Wait! Wait! You guys, we gotta do
something. They're gonna kill him.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.885
- He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby!

41:13.179 --> 41:15.430
Please.

41:15.514 --> 41:18.933
I didn't realize Xavier
was taking in animals—

41:19.018 --> 41:21.102
even animals
as unique as you.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.271
Who are you?

41:24.690 --> 41:27.275
Don't you remember?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.459
No! No!

41:47.421 --> 41:49.422
Logan, come on.
Let's go.

42:02.102 --> 42:06.189
Logan.
Go! I'll be fine.

42:06.273 --> 42:08.441
But we won't.

42:17.326 --> 42:18.993
Go. Keep going.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.105
All right. Get in. Get in! I'm driving.

42:47.189 --> 42:49.857
Hey. Maybe next time.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.487
This is Cyclops's car.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.198
Oh, yeah?

43:15.384 --> 43:17.218
What the hell
was that back there?

43:19.179 --> 43:22.265
Stryker. His name is Stryker.

43:22.349 --> 43:24.392
Who is he?

43:24.476 --> 43:26.644
I can't remember.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.646
Zone one clear.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.024
Roger that.

43:35.863 --> 43:39.073
Here. This is yours.

43:48.709 --> 43:51.294
I don't like
uncomfortable silences.

43:51.378 --> 43:53.421
What are you doing?

43:59.345 --> 44:02.055
I don't think
that's the CD player.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.601
Whoa.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.439
Sit back.

44:11.523 --> 44:14.609
- Where we going?
- Storm and Jean are in Boston. We'll head that way.

44:16.153 --> 44:18.905
- My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.589
Sergeant?

44:36.674 --> 44:39.842
Most of the mutants escaped through a series
of tunnels that weren't in our schematics.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.803
We have several in custody.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.763
How many?
Six, sir.

45:09.123 --> 45:12.291
Welcome, Professor.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.648
Take what we need, gentlemen.

45:37.609 --> 45:40.236
Look, I just think all this
anti-mutant protesting...

45:40.320 --> 45:43.948
underscores the genuine growing
concern among most Americans.

45:44.032 --> 45:45.950
I think mutant registration—
But why stop there?

45:46.034 --> 45:49.495
Maybe it would be easier to
round up mutants by the truckload.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.290
Or maybe you'd like all-out
war, Mr. Shaw. Oh, please.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.917
Turn that shit off, Lou.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.503
Lot on your mind?

45:59.965 --> 46:03.468
Mr. Laurio?

46:05.137 --> 46:07.847
I'm Grace.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.026
You want another beer?

46:21.236 --> 46:23.321
Of course you do.

46:31.497 --> 46:34.582
You're really aggressive.
Yes, I am.

46:37.002 --> 46:40.087
Oh, I— I've never hooked up
with a girl like you before.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.381
I know.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.677
It's, uh, kinda dirty in here,
don't you think?

46:46.762 --> 46:49.514
That's the idea. Velcro.

46:49.598 --> 46:52.725
Nice.
Bottom's up.

46:52.810 --> 46:55.019
I certainly hope so.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.120
Bottom's up.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.768
- William.
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.231
I call it
the neural inhibitor.

47:40.315 --> 47:43.484
It keeps you outta here.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.863
What have you
done with Scott?

47:46.947 --> 47:50.992
Don't worry. I'm just giving
him a little reeducation.

47:51.076 --> 47:54.328
Of course, you know
all about that, don't you?

47:54.413 --> 47:56.455
William, you wanted me
to cure your son.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.083
But mutation is not a
disease. You're lying!

48:00.669 --> 48:03.671
You were more frightened
of him than I was.

48:03.755 --> 48:08.050
You know, just one year after
Jason returned from your school...

48:08.135 --> 48:10.052
my wife—

48:10.137 --> 48:13.055
You see he resented us.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.641
He blamed us
for his condition.

48:15.726 --> 48:18.269
So he would
toy with our minds...

48:18.353 --> 48:21.439
projecting visions
and scenarios into our brains.

48:21.523 --> 48:25.776
Well, my wife,
in the end—

48:25.861 --> 48:29.071
She took a power drill
to her left temple...

48:29.156 --> 48:31.824
in an attempt
to bore the images out.

48:32.993 --> 48:36.495
My boy, the great illusionist.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.463
For someone
who hates mutants...

48:45.547 --> 48:48.466
you certainly keep
some strange company.

48:48.550 --> 48:51.177
Oh, they serve
their purpose...

48:51.261 --> 48:54.472
as long as
they can be controlled.

48:59.519 --> 49:02.104
You arranged the attack
on the president.

49:04.274 --> 49:06.734
You didn't even
have to read my mind.

49:09.947 --> 49:13.532
You know, I've been working with
mutants as long as you have, Xavier...

49:13.617 --> 49:15.701
but the most frustrating thing
I've learned...

49:15.786 --> 49:18.663
is that nobody really knows
how many even exist...

49:18.747 --> 49:20.873
or how to find them—

49:22.626 --> 49:25.169
except you.

49:25.253 --> 49:28.047
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

49:28.131 --> 49:30.383
You're much too powerful
for that.

49:30.467 --> 49:34.303
Instead, we'll go
right to the source.

49:35.889 --> 49:39.892
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

49:41.478 --> 49:46.148
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.360
But that's only
where it begins.

49:49.444 --> 49:51.404
Jason.

49:51.488 --> 49:55.032
Oh, my God, William.
This is your son.

49:55.158 --> 49:57.326
What have you done to him? No, Charles!

49:58.495 --> 50:00.913
My son is dead...

50:00.998 --> 50:03.290
just like the rest of you.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.525
Mom? Dad? Ronny?

50:29.609 --> 50:33.863
Is anybody home?

50:33.947 --> 50:35.948
I'll try and find you
some clothes.

50:36.033 --> 50:39.160
Don't burn anything.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.383
Hey. I found some of
my mom's old clothes.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.635
I think they're from
before I was born.

50:59.639 --> 51:01.140
Groovy.

51:07.606 --> 51:13.235
Hello.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.113
Come on, Jean.
Where are you?

51:46.853 --> 51:50.147
These are
my grandmother's.

51:50.232 --> 51:52.525
Thanks.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.695
You won't hurt me.

52:05.997 --> 52:08.332
Wow.

52:17.425 --> 52:19.969
I'm— I'm sorry.

52:22.430 --> 52:24.431
It's okay.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.354
Mmm.

52:52.169 --> 52:54.378
Hey, Ronny. Next time you—

52:55.672 --> 52:58.465
Who the hell are you?

52:58.592 --> 53:00.759
Uh—
Bobby.

53:00.844 --> 53:03.387
Honey, aren't you
supposed to be at school?

53:03.471 --> 53:09.268
Bobby, who is this guy?
- Uh, this is Professor Logan.

53:15.817 --> 53:17.943
There's something I need to tell you.

53:37.964 --> 53:40.841
You're clear.

53:56.691 --> 53:58.817
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

54:02.447 --> 54:05.241
There's something different
about you, Mr. Laurio.

54:05.325 --> 54:08.244
Yeah. I was having
a good day.

54:08.328 --> 54:11.997
No. No, it's not that.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.335
- Sit down.
- No.

54:16.419 --> 54:18.587
Sit your ass down.

54:18.672 --> 54:22.049
What could it be?

54:22.133 --> 54:25.010
What are you doing?

54:26.012 --> 54:29.014
Ahh. There it is.

54:30.350 --> 54:33.352
Too much iron in your blood.

54:52.706 --> 54:55.249
Mr. Laurio, never trust
a beautiful woman...

54:55.333 --> 54:58.502
especially one
who's interested in you.

55:45.842 --> 55:47.926
So, uh...

55:48.011 --> 55:50.512
when did you first know
you were a—

55:52.349 --> 55:54.266
A-
A mutant?

55:55.685 --> 55:57.728
Would you cut that out?

55:57.854 --> 55:59.813
You have to understand,

55:59.898 --> 56:02.149
We thought Bobby was going
to a school for the gifted.

56:02.233 --> 56:05.527
- Bobby is gifted.
- We know that. We just didn't realize he was—

56:05.612 --> 56:10.407
We still love you, Bobby. It's just
this mutant problem is a little—

56:10.492 --> 56:15.245
- What mutant problem?
- Complicated.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.457
What exactly are you a
professor of, Mr. Logan?

56:18.541 --> 56:21.335
Art.

56:21.419 --> 56:23.670
Well, you should see
what Bobby can do.

56:29.969 --> 56:32.679
Bobby.

56:36.309 --> 56:38.894
I can do a lot more than that.

56:43.691 --> 56:46.026
Oh. Ronny!

56:50.115 --> 56:52.783
This is all my fault.
Actually...

56:52.867 --> 56:56.161
they discovered that males are the ones
who carry the mutant gene and pass it on...

56:56.246 --> 56:58.038
so it's his fault.

56:58.123 --> 57:00.040
...the assassination
attempt...

57:02.961 --> 57:05.212
911. Please state your emergency.

57:05.296 --> 57:07.673
I need the police. There
are people in our house.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.883
They won't let us leave.
Authorities refused to comment...

57:09.968 --> 57:12.761
but it's believed that a manhunt for
several fugitives from the facility...

57:12.846 --> 57:14.847
is now underway.

57:17.392 --> 57:21.270
Nobody's responding.
I can't get a signal.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.355
Why don't you take a break?
I'll keep trying.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.441
Right.

57:54.429 --> 57:58.182
So, what are they?

57:58.266 --> 58:01.059
They are angelic symbols...

58:01.144 --> 58:05.147
passed on to mankind
by the Archangel Gabriel.

58:05.231 --> 58:10.903
They're beautiful.
How many do you have?

58:10.987 --> 58:13.780
One for every sin...

58:13.865 --> 58:15.365
so quite a few.

58:19.412 --> 58:21.413
You and Miss Grey
are schoolteachers?

58:21.498 --> 58:26.835
Yes. At a school for people
like us... where we can be safe.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.087
Safe from what?

58:29.172 --> 58:31.256
Everyone else.

58:33.718 --> 58:38.305
You know, outside of the circus,
most people were afraid of me.

58:38.389 --> 58:42.226
But I didn't hate them.
I pitied them.

58:43.228 --> 58:45.646
Do you know why?

58:45.730 --> 58:48.857
Because most people
will never know anything...

58:48.942 --> 58:52.945
beyond what they see
with their own two eyes.

58:53.029 --> 58:56.782
Well, I gave up on pity
a long time ago.

59:01.037 --> 59:06.041
Someone so beautiful
should not be so angry.

59:08.461 --> 59:10.379
Sometimes anger...

59:10.463 --> 59:12.631
can help you survive.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.552
So can faith.

59:16.636 --> 59:19.888
Storm, I found
an active com device.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.765
Where?

59:29.983 --> 59:32.985
Oh, it's for me.

59:35.154 --> 59:37.531
Bobby...

59:37.615 --> 59:42.703
have you tried
not being a mutant?

59:42.787 --> 59:46.290
No one's left, Jean.
Soldiers came.

59:46.416 --> 59:50.210
What about the children? Some of them
escaped. I'm not sure about the rest.

59:50.295 --> 59:53.046
We haven't been able to reach
the professor or Scott either.

59:53.172 --> 59:56.842
Where are you, Logan? Boston,
with Bobby Drake's family.

59:56.926 --> 01:00:01.597
- Okay. We're on our way.
- And Storm? Make it fast.

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.354
We have to go now.
Why?

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.023
Now!
Logan, what's wrong?

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.905
Drop the knives
and put your hands in the air.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:22.200
What's going on here?
- Ronny.

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:24.870
I said drop the knives.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:28.248
Open the door!
Break it.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:30.626
Turn around.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.044
- Up against the wall.
- Okay!

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:37.257
This is just a misunderstanding.
Put the knives down.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.801
I can't.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.387
Look.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.889
Oh!

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.437
All right, the rest of you,
on the ground now.

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:53.231
Look, kid,
I said on the ground.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:03.075
We don't want to
hurt you, kid.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:10.874
You know all those dangerous
mutants you hear about on the news?

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:14.920
I'm the worst one.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.280
Look out!

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.340
Guten tag.

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:27.803
Who the hell is this?
Kurt Wagner.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:31.139
But in the Munich circus, I was known
as "the Incredible Night crawler"—

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:34.309
- Aw, save it. Storm?
We're outta here.

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:36.853
Whoa.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.791
Jason, stop it!

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:22.691
It's all right.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.026
You can come out.
Have they gone?

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.696
Yes.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.785
- Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.288
Well, then, we'll have to
find them, won't we?

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:45.797
We'll use Cerebro.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.383
Come on.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.562
How far are we?

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:03.148
We're actually coming up
on the mansion now.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.360
I've got two signals approaching.

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:11.114
Coming in fast.

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:19.748
Unidentified aircraft, you are ordered
to descend to 20,000 feet.

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:24.294
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air
Force base. You have 10 seconds to comply.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:27.297
- Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:31.927
We are coming up alongside you to
escort you to Hanscom Air Force base.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:35.013
Lower your altitude now.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:41.478
Repeat, lower your altitude to 20,000 feet.
This is your last warning.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.777
They're falling back.

01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:52.155
They're marking us.

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:54.032
- What?
- They're gonna fire. Hang on!

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:06.670
I gotta shake 'em.

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:16.054
- Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:21.101
Don't we have
any weapons in this heap?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.583
Warning, warning, warning.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.770
Warning, warning, warning,
warning, warning.

01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:12.485
Warning, warning, warning,
warning, warning, warning.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.779
Warning, warning, warning—

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:31.212
- Everybody okay back there?
- No.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.305
Oh, my God.
There's two of 'em.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:02.327
There's one more.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.995
Jean—

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:07.290
Oh, God!

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.259
Rogue!

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:21.679
No!

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:04.389
- Jean?
- It's not me.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.446
When will these people
learn how to fly?

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.551
Thank you.
Bitte schön.

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:52.478
- Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:55.607
His name is
Colonel William Stryker...

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:58.276
and he invaded your mansion
for one purpose:

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.905
He wanted Cerebro.

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:04.532
Or enough of it
to build one of his own.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:09.913
But that doesn't make any sense.
Stryker would need the professor to operate it.

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.874
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend is still alive.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:15.752
Oh, my God.

01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:18.546
Now, what are you all so afraid of?

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:20.965
While Cerebro is working,
Charles' mind is connected...

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.218
to every living person
on the planet.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:25.970
If he were forced to concentrate
hard enough on a particular group—

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:29.015
let's say, mutants,
for example—

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:32.477
- he could kill us all.
- Wait a minute.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:36.272
How would Stryker even know where
to find Cerebro in the first place?

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.569
Because I told him.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:46.032
I helped Charles build it,
remember?

01:10:46.116 --> 01:10:50.411
Mr. Stryker has powerful
methods of persuasion.

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.956
Even against a mutant
as strong as Charles.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:57.877
So who's this Stryker anyway?
He's a military scientist.

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:02.006
He spent his whole life trying
to solve the mutant problem.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:06.844
If you want a more intimate
perspective, why don't you ask Wolverine?

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:10.556
You don't remember,
do you?

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:14.769
William Stryker, the only other man
I know who can manipulate adamantium.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:19.357
The metal on your bones.
It carries his signature.

01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:23.361
- But the professor-
- The professor trusted...

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:27.031
you were smart enough to
discover this on your own.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.867
He gives you more credit
than I do.

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:34.747
- Why do you need us?
- Mystique has discovered plans of a base...

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.126
that Stryker's been
operating out off or decades.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.461
We know that's where
he's building the second Cerebro...

01:11:40.546 --> 01:11:44.173
but we don't know
where this base is...

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:46.676
and I believe
one of you might.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:52.432
- The professor already tried.
- Once again, you think it's all about you.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:58.187
Oh... hello.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:07.613
I didn't mean to snoop.
Just try and relax.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:25.381
I'm sorry.

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:31.220
Stryker's at Alkali Lake.

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:34.349
That's where the professor
sent me. There's nothing left.

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:39.395
There's nothing left on the surface,
Logan. The base is underground.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.037
Hey.
Hey.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:00.375
You okay?

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.835
Yeah.
You sure?

01:13:02.961 --> 01:13:07.215
How we doing?
Not good.

01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:10.093
It'll take four or five hours before
I can get it off the ground.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:13.304
That's not what I meant.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:17.767
I'm just worried about
Scott. I'm worried about you.

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:20.812
That was some display
of power up there.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:25.274
Obviously, it wasn't enough.
Hey, hey. Come on. All right?

01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.488
I love him.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.826
Do you?

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.412
Girls flirt with
the dangerous guy, Logan...

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.497
they don't take him home.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.291
They marry the good guy.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:44.335
I could be the good guy.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.171
Logan, the good guy
sticks around.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:57.265
Jean.
Please. Please.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:00.226
Don't make me do this. Do what?

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.813
This.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.783
Excuse me.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:20.455
They say you can imitate
anybody... even their voice.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:24.041
Even their voice.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:27.837
Then why not stay in
disguise all the time?

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:31.924
You know,
look like everyone else.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.844
Because
we shouldn't have to.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.708
Look—

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:32.151
No one's ever left a scar
quite like you.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.487
What do you want,
an apology?

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:36.989
You know what I want.

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.911
But what do you want?

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.299
What do you really want?

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.803
I want you to get out.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.811
Jesus.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:15.319
Why don't we get uniforms?
Yeah, where's ours?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:18.739
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:28.833
We love what you've done
with your hair.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:35.464
Hey, hey.
Come on. Let's go.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:45.641
So, they say
you're the bad guy.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:49.562
Is that what
they say?

01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:57.069
That's a dorky-looking
helmet. What's it for?

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:59.947
This dorky-looking helmet is the
only thing that's gonna protect me...

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.700
from the real bad guys.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.042
- What's your name?
- John.

01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:15.588
What's your real name,
John?

01:17:21.094 --> 01:17:23.596
Pyro.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.806
Quite a talent
you have there, Pyro.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.851
I can only manipulate
the fire.

01:17:28.935 --> 01:17:30.645
I can't create it.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.856
You are a god among insects.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.567
Never let anyone tell you different.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:01.133
Sir, the machine has been
completed to all specifications.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:03.010
Good.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:06.472
Ow!

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:10.476
If I may ask, sir, why are we
keeping the children here?

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.270
I'm a scientist,
Sergeant Lyman.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:18.442
When I build a machine, I wanna
make sure that it's working.

01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:27.034
All right, this is a
topographic map of the dam.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.036
This is the spillway.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.289
You see these density
changes in the terrain?

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.333
They're tire tracks.
That's the entrance.

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:38.379
Mm-hmm. And this shows the depth of
the ice that's covering the ground.

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:40.965
Now, this is recent
water activity.

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:43.092
If we go in there, Stryker
could flood the spillway.

01:18:43.176 --> 01:18:45.052
Can you teleport inside?

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:49.265
No. I have to be able
to see where I'm going...

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:52.101
otherwise I could
wind up inside a wall.

01:18:52.185 --> 01:18:56.522
I'll go. I have a hunch
he'll want me alive.

01:18:56.606 --> 01:19:01.402
Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs
to be able to operate the spillway mechanism.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:03.446
What do you intend to do?

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:06.365
Scratch it with your claws?

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.743
I'll take my chances.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:11.328
But I won't.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:36.353
Sir, there's someone
coming down the spillway.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:42.526
I'm flooding it.
Wait.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.701
Stryker!

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.836
Stryker!

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:06.050
Well, look who's come home.

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:21.398
Move and you're dead.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:54.640
The one thing I know better
than anyone is my own work.

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:57.643
Seal the room. Shoot it.

01:20:57.727 --> 01:20:59.436
Seal the room
Step away!

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:18.205
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.416
Anybody?
What—

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:32.887
Can you override
the spillway mechanism?

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:35.681
Everything's controlled from inside that
room. That's why the doors are so thick.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:39.143
Oh, really? Get some
charges! Blow the doors open!

01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:43.022
Take out these cameras!

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.819
I'm in.

01:21:48.945 --> 01:21:52.489
She's good.
You have no idea.

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:08.213
Fire in the hole.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.511
Move, move, move.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.530
Sergeant, she's opened
the spillway doors.

01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.866
More mutants have entered
the base. How many?

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.494
We've lost coms. There's some
sort of electrical interference—

01:22:38.578 --> 01:22:42.122
Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest of
your men and meet me outside Cerebro.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.417
You carry on. When I come back,
I want this door open all the way!

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:02.351
Welcome, Professor.

01:23:02.435 --> 01:23:06.897
- Don't leave me alone, please?
- You can come inside.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.412
Have you found it?

01:24:03.496 --> 01:24:07.958
A large portion of energy from the
dam has been diverted to this chamber.

01:24:08.084 --> 01:24:09.626
Cerebro.
There it is.

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:12.963
Can you shut it down from here? No.

01:24:13.089 --> 01:24:15.299
Come. There's little
time. Not without us.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:22.264
Oh, my God.
The children.

01:24:22.348 --> 01:24:24.433
- Kurt, will you come with me?
- Yes.

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:27.978
Where are they? They're being held
in a containment cell one level down.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:31.482
Stryker.
All right...

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.442
we'll get the children
and meet you at Cerebro.

01:24:33.526 --> 01:24:37.738
Okay. I'll try to find Scott
and the professor.

01:24:37.822 --> 01:24:41.909
- Will you be all right without us?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.328
Where's Logan?

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:52.503
He's gone.

01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:56.548
You, set up a perimeter.
Move, move.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.882
Jason.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.057
It's time.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:54.439
Time to
find our friends.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:02.906
Is it time to
find our friends?

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:06.201
- All of them.
- All of them?

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.912
- All of the mutants.
- All the mutants?

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:13.292
- Everywhere.
- Everywhere?

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:16.170
That's right.
Every one of them?

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:18.630
Oh, yes.
Good.

01:26:19.632 --> 01:26:23.594
It's time to
bring it to an end.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.931
Make me proud.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:59.296
Just don't move.

01:27:01.132 --> 01:27:05.510
Kill anyone who
approaches... even if it's me.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:33.872
Go! I'll take care of him!

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:37.668
This is one lover's quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:49.721
Scott!

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.223
Scott?

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:56.520
Help us! Anybody!
- Listen.

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:58.689
Help! Get us out of here.

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.691
- Julie?
- Storm.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:03.944
Get us out of here!
Okay, we're coming.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.459
Scott!

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.440
Scott, don't do this!

01:29:33.659 --> 01:29:35.744
Jean, no, no, no.
It's okay.

01:29:35.828 --> 01:29:37.329
It's okay. It's me.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:39.748
Scott.
I'm so sorry.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:44.086
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh, God.

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:49.174
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.218
I tried. I'm sorry. I love you so much.

01:29:51.302 --> 01:29:53.178
I love you.

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:58.600
My leg.
Okay, easy. Easy.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:00.143
Scott...

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.648
something's wrong.

01:30:13.449 --> 01:30:17.953
My God. No!

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:24.918
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:27.504
I'm trying.
There are so many of them.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:30.298
Then concentrate.

01:30:30.383 --> 01:30:32.342
Concentrate.

01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:40.554
The tricky thing about
adamantium is...

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:43.139
that if you ever
manage to process...

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:48.436
its raw, liquid form,
you gotta keep it that way.

01:32:49.438 --> 01:32:53.567
Keep it hot.

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.861
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.866
But you already
know that.

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:05.996
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:13.169
I was wrong.

01:33:31.731 --> 01:33:33.940
Holy shit.

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.004
That's it.

01:35:21.924 --> 01:35:23.842
Whoa. Where do you
think you're going?

01:35:23.926 --> 01:35:26.219
I'm sick of this kid's table shit.
I'm going in there.

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:29.264
John, they told us to stay here.

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:31.307
You always do as you're told?

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:35.330
Find all the mutants.

01:36:35.414 --> 01:36:37.332
Find them.

01:36:37.416 --> 01:36:41.878
Find all the mutants. Find
them all. Each one. All of them.

01:36:42.004 --> 01:36:44.005
Good.
Kill them.

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.723
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:38.059
Now, find them all.
Find all the mutants.

01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:40.478
You, concentrate harder.

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:46.025
Kill them.
Kill them all.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:48.027
Kill them.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:52.073
Cerebro.

01:37:52.157 --> 01:37:55.159
We're too late.

01:38:03.586 --> 01:38:06.254
Eric, hurry!

01:38:53.177 --> 01:38:57.180
That's strange.

01:39:33.926 --> 01:39:36.594
How does it
look from there, Charles?

01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:38.846
Still fighting the good fight?

01:39:38.931 --> 01:39:43.434
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

01:39:45.104 --> 01:39:48.189
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:28.479
There's been
a change of plan.

01:40:46.331 --> 01:40:49.667
Good-bye, Charles.

01:41:04.767 --> 01:41:07.393
There's been
a change of plans.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:11.064
Now find them. Find
them all— the humans.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:13.483
Find all the humans.
Every one.

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:36.005
How does it feel, bub?

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:43.805
Why did you come back? You
cut me open. You took my life!

01:41:43.889 --> 01:41:47.058
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

01:41:47.142 --> 01:41:50.728
As I recall, it was you who
volunteered for the procedure.

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:55.525
Who am I?
You...

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:58.194
are just a failed experiment.

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.491
If you really knew
about your past...

01:42:03.575 --> 01:42:06.202
what kind of person you were...

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:08.830
the work we did together-

01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:12.917
People don't change,
Wolverine.

01:42:13.001 --> 01:42:15.711
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:18.172
I just gave you claws.

01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:45.658
What the hell is that?
What is it?

01:42:45.742 --> 01:42:49.787
The dam's ruptured. It's gonna
flood water into the spillway.

01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:54.375
It's trying to relieve the pressure.
It's too late.

01:42:54.459 --> 01:42:56.836
In a few minutes,
we'll all be underwater.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.839
Come with me, and I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

01:42:59.923 --> 01:43:04.010
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

01:43:04.094 --> 01:43:08.973
You're a survivor,
always have been.

01:43:09.057 --> 01:43:13.394
Oh, I thought I was just
an animal... with claws.

01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:19.400
If we die, you die.

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:28.159
Aaah!

01:43:28.243 --> 01:43:31.078
There are no exits that way, Wolverine!

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:36.083
Find all the humans.
Every one. Find them.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:38.669
Find all the humans.
Find them all.

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:44.800
- What is this?
- Cerebro.

01:43:46.678 --> 01:43:48.304
Storm.

01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:51.098
Jean. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine.

01:43:51.183 --> 01:43:53.392
What's happening?

01:43:53.477 --> 01:43:56.729
Professor's still in there...
with another mutant.

01:43:56.813 --> 01:44:00.066
He's trapped
in some kind of illusion.

01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:02.693
Oh, my God.

01:44:02.778 --> 01:44:05.738
Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants anymore.

01:44:05.822 --> 01:44:09.700
Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.178
Impossible.

01:44:55.706 --> 01:44:58.916
- Everybody stand back.
- Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro.

01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:02.753
Opening the door could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

01:45:02.838 --> 01:45:06.340
Wait. Kurt, I need
you to take me inside.

01:45:06.425 --> 01:45:09.302
- Storm, who is this guy? Who are you?
- My name is Kurt Wagner...

01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:13.389
but in the Munich circus—
He's a teleporter.

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:16.559
I told you, if I can't see
where I'm going—

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:19.562
I have faith in you.

01:45:23.233 --> 01:45:25.776
Don't believe
anything you see in there.

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:34.118
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

01:45:34.202 --> 01:45:37.204
Thy kingdom come,
they will be done on Earth—

01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:41.792
As it is in heaven.

01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:53.304
Hello.

01:45:54.598 --> 01:45:56.599
What are you looking for?

01:45:58.393 --> 01:46:02.980
Professor, can you hear me?

01:46:03.065 --> 01:46:07.151
- You've got to stop Cerebro now.
- Who are you talking to?

01:46:08.945 --> 01:46:10.696
No. Don't move.

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:13.199
But she's just a little girl.

01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:15.576
No, she's not.

01:46:19.164 --> 01:46:22.917
I've got my eyes on you.

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:29.715
Mr. Stryker.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.426
Funny, we keep
running into each other.

01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:36.555
Mark my words,
it'll never happen again.

01:46:39.684 --> 01:46:43.687
Kurt, it's about
to get very cold in here.

01:46:43.772 --> 01:46:46.941
I'm not going anywhere.

01:46:52.614 --> 01:46:54.490
What are you doing?

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:34.530
Find all the humans. Kill them.

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.699
Every single one.
Find all the humans.

01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:43.497
Focus. Focus.
Find all the humans.

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:54.175
Stop it!

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:07.146
Jason. He's going to be so angry at me.

01:48:34.758 --> 01:48:38.594
Logan. Logan, where are you?

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:10.960
We have to get out
through the spillway.

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:52.001
You don't want to go
that way. Trust me.

01:50:03.054 --> 01:50:06.682
Come on. There's
another way out of here.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:40.716
The helicopter
was right here!

01:51:23.885 --> 01:51:27.721
I will take him.
Okay.

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:56.875
It's okay, Rogue. It's okay.
You can let go, honey.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.920
- Let go.
- Go. I'll be fine.

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:02.631
You sure?
Yeah.

01:52:14.352 --> 01:52:16.729
Who has the answers,
Wolverine?

01:52:16.813 --> 01:52:19.523
Those people?

01:52:19.607 --> 01:52:23.110
That creature
in your arms?

01:52:24.779 --> 01:52:26.405
Huh?

01:52:26.489 --> 01:52:28.449
Huh?

01:52:37.667 --> 01:52:39.752
I'll take my chances with him.

01:52:42.630 --> 01:52:46.383
One day, someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine!

01:52:46.468 --> 01:52:52.431
One day!

01:52:56.686 --> 01:53:01.356
Scott, we've got to
get to Washington.

01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:07.362
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

01:53:08.406 --> 01:53:10.491
Bobby.
I got 'im.

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:14.745
You okay?

01:53:14.829 --> 01:53:17.664
I am now.

01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:27.841
- What's wrong?
- Vertical thrusters are off line.

01:53:27.926 --> 01:53:29.092
So fix 'em.
I'm trying.

01:53:29.177 --> 01:53:31.929
- Has anyone seen John?
- Pyro?

01:53:32.013 --> 01:53:33.931
Where the hell
is he?

01:53:34.015 --> 01:53:36.600
He's with Magneto.

01:53:36.684 --> 01:53:39.853
They're functioning, but I don't
know how long they're going to last.

01:53:39.938 --> 01:53:41.855
I'm trying to override.
It's not responding.

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:47.027
- Come on!
- Oh, no, we've lost the power.

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:59.331
There's power in the fuel cells,
we're just not connecting.

01:53:59.415 --> 01:54:01.333
Okay. I've—

01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:22.437
Scott, the engine
control system is shot.

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:26.483
- Which part?
- All of it.

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:33.156
Where's the override?
- It's gonna take some time.

01:54:48.006 --> 01:54:50.507
Storm, we need some kind
of external power.

01:54:50.592 --> 01:54:53.135
- Jean?
- Wait. Where is Jean?

01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:58.098
She's outside.

01:55:12.196 --> 01:55:14.281
No, we're not leaving!
Lower the ramp!

01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:30.088
Storm, lower it!

01:55:30.173 --> 01:55:32.341
I can't.

01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:56.114
She's controlling the jet.

01:56:02.038 --> 01:56:05.707
You, get her, now!
She's not letting me.

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:07.042
Damn it!

01:56:12.256 --> 01:56:16.385
I know what I'm doing.

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:19.346
- This is—
... the only way.

01:56:20.932 --> 01:56:25.102
Jean, listen to me.

01:56:26.771 --> 01:56:29.648
Don't do this.
Good-bye.

01:56:29.732 --> 01:56:34.403
- Oh, no! No!
- No! No!

01:56:58.761 --> 01:57:00.721
She's gone.

01:57:02.765 --> 01:57:06.893
- She's gone.
- Don't you say that!

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.520
We gotta go back.
She's gone.

01:57:08.604 --> 01:57:12.399
No! No.

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:32.711
She's gone.
She's gone. She's—

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:37.466
She's gone.

01:57:49.145 --> 01:57:51.563
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

01:57:51.647 --> 01:57:56.443
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:57:56.527 --> 01:58:00.405
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of the death...

01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:02.824
I will fear no evil...

01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:07.579
for thou art with me.

01:58:18.883 --> 01:58:22.636
Today I've been given an opportunity
to shed light on recent occurrences...

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:24.888
from the attack that ended
in this office— Good morning.

01:58:24.972 --> 01:58:27.349
Good morning— to the unexplained
phenomenon that swept the Earth...

01:58:27.475 --> 01:58:30.102
nearly annihilating our way of
life. Good morning, Mr. President.

01:58:30.186 --> 01:58:33.438
- Good morning. Do we like
this word "annihilating"?

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:36.483
Good morning.

01:58:36.567 --> 01:58:39.945
Good morning,
Mr. President.

01:58:40.029 --> 01:58:41.321
Thank you.

01:58:48.287 --> 01:58:52.040
Mr. President, we're live
in five, four, three, two—

01:58:54.043 --> 01:58:58.463
My fellow Americans,
in this time of adversity...

01:58:58.548 --> 01:59:00.799
we are being offered
a moment...

01:59:00.883 --> 01:59:04.803
a moment to recognize a growing
threat within our own population...

01:59:04.887 --> 01:59:09.057
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

01:59:13.896 --> 01:59:16.565
Did we just lose the feed?
Are we still live?

01:59:52.268 --> 01:59:56.021
Good morning, Mr. President.

01:59:56.105 --> 02:00:00.567
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

02:00:00.651 --> 02:00:04.696
- Who are you people?
- We're mutants.

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.074
My name is Charles Xavier.
Please, sit down.

02:00:08.159 --> 02:00:12.746
- I'd rather stand.
- Rogue.

02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:17.250
These files were taken from the
private offices of William Stryker.

02:00:26.344 --> 02:00:28.553
How did you get this?

02:00:28.638 --> 02:00:32.307
Well, let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.653
I've never seen this
information. I know.

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.905
Then you also know
I don't respond well to threats.

02:00:46.989 --> 02:00:50.450
Mr. President, this is not a threat.
This is an opportunity.

02:00:50.534 --> 02:00:54.663
There are forces in this world,
both mutant and human alike...

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:57.082
who believe that a war is coming.

02:00:57.166 --> 02:01:01.002
You will see from those files that
some have already tried to start one...

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:04.756
and there have been casualties.

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:07.342
Losses on both sides.

02:01:13.266 --> 02:01:16.434
Mr. President...

02:01:16.519 --> 02:01:20.313
what you were about to tell the
world is true— this is a moment.

02:01:20.398 --> 02:01:23.108
A moment to repeat
the mistakes of the past...

02:01:23.192 --> 02:01:27.028
or to work together
for a better future.

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:32.784
We're here to stay, Mr. President.
The next move is yours.

02:01:32.868 --> 02:01:35.620
We'll be watching.

02:01:53.347 --> 02:01:57.225
Mr. President.

02:02:24.253 --> 02:02:26.171
You know...

02:02:26.255 --> 02:02:28.840
even when Jean
was a student...

02:02:28.924 --> 02:02:32.010
she was always hesitant
about her powers.

02:02:32.094 --> 02:02:36.890
Always looking to others.

02:02:36.974 --> 02:02:41.936
Feeling that in some way
she was left behind.

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:47.776
Do you think—

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.654
Could we have done
more to save her?

02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:57.118
In the past, she may have let us.

02:02:57.203 --> 02:03:00.789
There had to be another way.

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:03.375
Why did she leave the plane?

02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:09.547
Because she made a choice.

02:03:09.632 --> 02:03:13.551
Yes, come on in.

02:03:25.106 --> 02:03:27.315
Hey, hey.

02:03:29.276 --> 02:03:32.821
Listen, she did make a choice.

02:03:35.282 --> 02:03:37.283
It was you.

02:04:10.025 --> 02:04:12.527
Professor?

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:14.654
Is everything all right?

02:04:17.408 --> 02:04:20.618
Yes, I think it will be.

02:04:20.703 --> 02:04:23.663
Now, tell me, have any
of you read a book...

02:04:23.747 --> 02:04:27.375
by an English novelist
named T.H. White...

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:30.753
called The Once and Future King?

02:04:30.838 --> 02:04:33.423
No? Well—

02:04:38.846 --> 02:04:40.388
Mutation.

02:04:40.473 --> 02:04:42.724
It is the key
to our evolution.

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:45.810
It is how we have evolved from
a single-celled organism...

02:04:45.895 --> 02:04:48.938
into the dominant species
on the planet.

02:04:49.023 --> 02:04:50.857
This process is slow...

02:04:50.941 --> 02:04:54.652
normally taking thousands
and thousands of years.

02:04:54.737 --> 02:04:57.697
But every
few hundred millennia...

02:04:57.781 --> 02:05:00.445
evolution leaps forward.
