(TRAIN HORN BLASTS)

00:53.800 --> 00:56.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:56.400 --> 00:58.160
Welcome.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.440
Now, a couple of months ago,

01:00.480 --> 01:03.040
we were sitting around,
wondering what we should do

01:03.080 --> 01:06.000
for this, the last programme
in the series.

01:06.040 --> 01:10.200
Yeah. I said we should
build a car that's also
an aircraft carrier.

01:10.240 --> 01:14.280
Yeah, I wanted to
fire a car into space.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.200
But then we decided that
what we should actually do,

01:16.240 --> 01:18.840
because neither of those
things were ambitious enough,

01:18.880 --> 01:21.400
-was end world hunger.
-(LAUGHTER)

01:21.440 --> 01:23.320
Yeah. It's a big job.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.880
Yeah, it's not the sort
of thing that we could
achieve in 20 minutes

01:25.920 --> 01:29.040
with a couple of guests
and a bit of idle chit-chat
in-between.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.360
No. We were going to need
the whole show.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.120
So settle back now
as we take The Grand Tour
on a mini special

01:36.160 --> 01:40.080
to the poverty-stricken
but beautiful country

01:40.120 --> 01:41.440
of Mozambique.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.360
This is the village of Bingo
in the west of the country.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.600
The people here
are not starving,

02:02.640 --> 02:04.720
but they are very poor.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.360
Jesus here has to exist on
a diet of miserable gruel,

02:12.400 --> 02:16.200
which is fine for silly rich
women in London and New York.

02:16.240 --> 02:21.440
But food like this makes
the average red-blooded
African man very sad.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.280
And that's odd,
because just 200 miles away

02:28.320 --> 02:29.840
things are very different.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.760
(HUBBUB OF MARKET)

02:36.640 --> 02:39.440
This is Mozambique's
capital city, Maputo.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.840
And the people here are
well-nourished and happy

02:44.880 --> 02:46.640
because they live
by the ocean...

02:48.800 --> 02:50.440
...which is full of fish.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.480
(MARKET CHATTER)

02:54.320 --> 02:56.200
And that got us wondering.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.160
How hard can it be...

02:59.200 --> 03:02.680
...to get the fish from here
to that village we were
looking at earlier?

03:02.720 --> 03:05.200
Yeah. Now, this isn't
a very wealthy country.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.280
-In fact,
it's a poor country.
-Desperately poor.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.080
Desperately poor. So they
don't have refrigerated trucks,
all that kind of stuff.

03:11.120 --> 03:15.360
No, but we're talking about
200 miles. That's London to
Leeds, isn't it?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.280
It's nothing
to get this there.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.240
I'm telling you, when
we get this sorted out,

03:19.280 --> 03:22.840
when we move these fish
to Bingo,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.440
there'll be Nobel Prizes
in it for us.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.680
-And I'd be Boutros
Boutros-May.
-Yes.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.080
And I'd be Ban Ki-Hammond.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.520
-What? Oh, Ban Ki.
-Yeah.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.160
-I'm gonna go for
a knighthood...
-Do it. Why not?

03:34.200 --> 03:36.280
-...beat David Beckham to it.
-That'd go down well.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.760
JAMES: Unfortunately,
having agreed that
we would end world hunger

03:42.800 --> 03:44.920
by moving fish
across Mozambique,

03:44.960 --> 03:47.920
we couldn't agree on how
this might be achieved.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.120
So we ended up
with different solutions.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.600
This is what I came up with -
a 1984 Mercedes wagon,

03:59.640 --> 04:03.760
a car famous throughout
Africa for its rugged
dependability.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.160
However, I have modified it
extensively.

04:08.200 --> 04:12.680
In the back,
filling up all of the back,
is a Perspex tank.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.640
What I'm going to do
is fill that with sea water

04:15.680 --> 04:17.640
and then put the fishes
in there

04:17.680 --> 04:19.360
and they will stay alive

04:19.400 --> 04:21.160
as I make my way inland.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.440
Now, you can't get fish fresher
than fishes that are still
swimming around in the sea.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.880
I have been clever.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.160
Very clever.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.360
Not as clever as me.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.520
Because for the first time
in my entire life,

04:35.560 --> 04:39.280
I've made a sensible
decision. I've gone for this.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.680
It's a pick-up truck that
Nissan named after me.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.600
It's called the Hardbody.

04:45.640 --> 04:52.960
It's got tons of space in the
back for cod and bream
and sticklebacks.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.800
And it has four-wheel drive,
which I reckon is going to be
essential,

04:56.840 --> 04:59.440
because - and James hasn't
realised this -

04:59.480 --> 05:01.280
it's the rainy season
in Mozambique,

05:01.320 --> 05:08.520
so I reckon the roads
are gonna be... hell.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.800
JEREMY: Hammond, meanwhile,
hadn't been clever at all.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.720
What do you think of that?

05:15.040 --> 05:20.840
-Well, I think it's
a... motorcycle.
-Yes, it is.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.800
Specifically,
it's a TVS Star HLX E5

05:23.840 --> 05:26.920
and I've just bought this
brand new from a supermarket

05:26.960 --> 05:28.480
for 800 quid.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.120
Brand spankers.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.320
Hammond,
this is not a quality item.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.920
It's built down to a budget,
isn't it? You can feel that.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.600
Is it a 1,000cc?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.280
-No, 100.
-What?

05:38.320 --> 05:40.680
-100cc.
-How many cylinders? Four?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.840
-One.
-One?

05:42.880 --> 05:45.240
-That one.
-So how much horsepower
has it got?

05:45.280 --> 05:47.400
-Seven. Seven.
-Seven?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.120
But it's light, it's agile.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.600
These things are
actually built in India

05:50.640 --> 05:53.320
specifically to be used
in Africa.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.640
-(CHUCKLES)
-They are!

05:54.680 --> 05:57.240
They're built in India
specifically for use
in Africa...

05:57.280 --> 05:59.320
It's too poor to be used
in India.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.920
I can see why the Indians
don't want it.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.800
It's rugged, it's tough,
it can go off-road
if we need to.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.840
-It can do anything.
-But what it can't do,
Hammond,

06:06.880 --> 06:09.120
is transport
a large amount of fish.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.480
Exactly what I was thinking.
If I wanted a pizza delivery,

06:11.520 --> 06:12.880
this is the sort of
thing...

06:12.920 --> 06:15.920
I've thought about this.
Let me explain my idea.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.800
This is my genius. What
they do here is dry the fish
in the wind

06:19.840 --> 06:21.120
cos it lasts longer.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.040
-Is that fish?
-That's fish,
drying in the wind.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.480
-It looks like cats.
-No, it's fish!

06:25.520 --> 06:28.080
I'm gonna build a rack like
that, fit it to the back,

06:28.120 --> 06:30.800
and then I'll dry the fish
as I go along.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.920
It's brilliant!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.920
That is literally the
stupidest idea
I've ever heard of.

06:34.960 --> 06:38.040
What are you gonna do, sling
your fish in your pick-up and
watch them rot?

06:38.080 --> 06:41.560
Ah! No. Actually,
I have a plan on that.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.320
But I do need your help.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.720
RICHARD: Jeremy's plan was
to break into a hotel

06:52.760 --> 06:55.400
in the dead of night
and do a burglary.

You're gonna have to tilt it!

You're gonna have to tilt it!

07:06.320 --> 07:09.080

07:17.120 --> 07:19.560
JEREMY: Why is it so heavy?
RICHARD: Ssh!

07:19.600 --> 07:21.560
There's a lot of gubbins
in it.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.360
JEREMY: The next morning,
we all met up on the beach

07:30.400 --> 07:35.640
and I set about fitting
the hotel's ice machine
to my Hardbody.

07:35.680 --> 07:42.200
Right, so I need a bucket of
water above the height of
the stolen ice machine

07:42.240 --> 07:47.040
from which the Solenoid ice
machine can get the supply
that it can convert into ice.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.440
Oh, yeah.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.640
Generator in place.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.440
Water tank in place.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.520
Meanwhile, Hammond was
building his fish rack...

08:08.080 --> 08:12.080
...and May was filling
his Macquarium
with sea water.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.560
How much is your car going
to weigh when it's full?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.440
An extra 700.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.960
-Tons?
-No, kilograms.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.040
-So it's at 0.7 of a ton...
-Yeah, extra.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.560
-Extra. And he's parked it...
-On sand. Wet sand.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.400
-Wet sand.
-But the fish aren't heavy.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.960
Tyre. Look at the tyre.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.760
RICHARD: The tide is
definitely coming in.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.400
JEREMY: With the Indian Ocean
nibbling at his back end,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.960
James's tank
was eventually full.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.120

as quick as possible.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.000

104 horsepower.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.600

please,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.520
and tow me

That's what you've got it
for! Get it in front!

09:31.720 --> 09:33.840
He's really shouting at me.

I don't respond well
to shouting. I like calmness.

-Can you help?
-Yep.

-I want a tow!

09:41.200 --> 09:44.240
You've got a four-by-four.
Put it there.
Just tow me a bit.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.680
I helped you nick
the ice-making machine.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.720
Do something in return.

Oh, you pillock!

10:31.880 --> 10:36.720
Hammond,
there's a really bad noise...

10:36.760 --> 10:38.440
I dropped him right where
the sewage is.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.280
RICHARD: OK.
-There's a terrible noise.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.520
coming from the bottom
of my gear lever

10:42.560 --> 10:44.640
when it's underload,
pulling him.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.880
-What is that?
-That clicking metallic--

10:47.920 --> 10:49.600
-Could you hear it?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.200
Dunno. Honestly don't know.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.800
Thank you. But you were
supposed to do it gently.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.200
-That's what I was shouting.
-My car is broken.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.160
-Well...
-Mine's not, fortunately.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.000
-How did that happen?
-You did it.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.960
You might have
holed his radiator.
We haven't had a look yet.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.720
-When I said "Stop",
you accelerated.
-Yeah, that did happen.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.720
The noise of my
disintegrating gearbox

11:08.760 --> 11:10.560
was drowning you out.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.160
I didn't know your gearbox
was disintegrating.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.640
-It is now.
-Radiator and fan are OK.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.440
-I knew they were.
I judged it to perfection.
-Course you did.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.640
JEREMY: Once we'd replaced
the water James was now
wearing,

11:22.680 --> 11:25.280
we were ready to go
and catch some fish,

11:25.320 --> 11:29.440
using local methods that
we didn't really understand.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.120
So far as we could tell, we
had to put James in the sea

11:35.160 --> 11:36.760
with one end of the rope,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.600
and then Hammond and I had to
row about,

11:39.640 --> 11:42.000
dropping off a net
as we went.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.160
And pull!

11:51.760 --> 11:53.800
Hold on, James, we'll be...

11:53.840 --> 11:55.720
This is how they do it here.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.720
No, that's the wrong way.
Gotta go the other way.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.600
Oh, shit, I'm on
the wrong side!

11:59.640 --> 12:02.680
Turn it. Oh (BLEEP) hell!

12:02.720 --> 12:05.840
As Hammond and I were
struggling to get into
a rhythm...

12:05.880 --> 12:09.120
Hang on, hang on.
The oar's come out.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.680
...and, as it turned out,
the Indian Ocean wasn't
that deep...

(RICHARD LAUGHS)

12:16.160 --> 12:18.600
JEREMY:
Where has all the sea gone?

12:18.640 --> 12:21.720
...we decided to push
the boat instead.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.800
Any minute now we're going
to start fishing.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.400
I think this might
actually be working.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.320
If they can just get
themselves back to here,

12:29.360 --> 12:31.280
we've got two ends of a net,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.240
pull it in full of fish.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.120
Arg! Shit!

12:37.160 --> 12:39.560
I've caught myself
in the net!

12:39.600 --> 12:40.840
Oh, shit!

12:40.880 --> 12:42.680
After this calamity...

12:42.720 --> 12:45.240
-Hammond, get it!
-I can't get it!

12:45.280 --> 12:47.560
...we decided that
we'd be better off

12:47.600 --> 12:49.120
in the boat after all.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.440
And soon we'd worked our way
back to James.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.120
-God!
JAMES: Come on!

12:57.160 --> 12:59.160
We're coming. Right, anchor.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.720
Right. Dropping anchor.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.080
What we do is, we pull it in,

13:04.120 --> 13:05.880
and then, as the net comes
towards us...

13:05.920 --> 13:07.680
...it fills up with fish.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.080
So is that the other end
of it?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.760
This is my end,
the beginning end.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.760
-Where's the other end?
-At the back of your boat.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.040
This is the other end,
isn't it?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.360
Hold on. No, wait.
This is the other end.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.400
But that's also
the other end.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.720
RICHARD:
This is the other end!

13:22.240 --> 13:23.840
JEREMY: Once we'd established
that somehow

13:23.880 --> 13:27.640
our rope had three ends,
we began hauling in the net.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.080
(STRAINING AND GROANING)

13:30.120 --> 13:33.560
Behold the sparkling treasure
of the seas!

13:33.600 --> 13:36.800
What we've achieved -
not only solving world hunger

13:36.840 --> 13:39.800
but mastering fishing
in a single day.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.840
Have you ever seen
Bono do this?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.520
-Angelina Jolie?
-No.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.640
Both of them well respected
for their charitable work.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.400
I haven't seen them
in the sea hauling nets.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.080
Or David Beckham.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.600
Eventually our catch
was on board.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.600
We've got eight plus one
that got out in the boat.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.440
And, to make matters worse...

14:06.480 --> 14:08.320
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

14:08.360 --> 14:10.280
There's a big squall coming.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.080
Yep, I can see it.
That'll be it.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.520
(WIND HOWLS)

14:13.560 --> 14:16.040
Urgh! It's getting
quite hairy out here now.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.480
(THUNDERCLAPS)

14:25.920 --> 14:27.720
We're all on board.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.240
You can't row in this.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.080
If we lift up the anchor,

14:34.120 --> 14:36.520
the wind will blow us
onto the shore.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.680
That's good.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.680
Or we might just miss it
and end up in Madagascar.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.000
Or Somalia.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.600
-Yeah.
-What's Madagascar like?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.920
-Better than Somalia.
-Yeah.

14:47.960 --> 14:53.320
Faced with the prospect of
being kidnapped by pirates...

14:53.360 --> 14:56.440
...we bravely decided to
abandon the boat we'd
borrowed

14:56.480 --> 14:59.960
and the fish we'd caught,
and hitch a ride back
to the harbour

15:00.000 --> 15:01.520
with the film crew.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.200
Oh, bollocks!

15:09.400 --> 15:13.440
The next day, though,
things started to look up.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.960
We went off fishing
this morning,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.120
before the camera crews
were up,

15:17.160 --> 15:19.840
and we've had a much more
successful morning,
much more.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.800
This is the result.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.840
I caught the dorado by hand,
in fact.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.760
That was quite
a wrestling match.
I remember watching that.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.560
I was hauling these in
at the time, all of them.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.160
Anyway, we've got a lot of
fish that we caught
ourselves,

15:32.200 --> 15:35.240
without the crew,
early this morning.

15:35.280 --> 15:39.680
RICHARD: And now it was time
to load them into our fish
transportation vehicles.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.240
JEREMY:
That is an octopus, look.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.160
You can see its face,

15:46.200 --> 15:50.600
the surprise from when James
wrestled it. Look at that.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.320
With a cheese sauce,
got a thermidor going on
right there.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.360
They will be kept succulent
and fresh

15:56.400 --> 15:58.720
for the journey to Bingo.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.000
Right, come on, matey.
In the big tank.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.760
You'll like it
with your mates.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.960
Hey, hey, hey! Look at that!

16:07.000 --> 16:09.320
(BLEEP)

16:09.360 --> 16:10.440
Sorry, mate. Sorry.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.200
Sorry. Oh, he's sandy.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.400
Oh, bollocks.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.080
I'll rinse him off.
There you go.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.760
He's OK.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.640
So it goes in its mouth
and out of its anus?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.280
No. It'll go in its mouth

16:26.320 --> 16:28.960
and then I imagine
out of its gill.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.200
No, it needs to go through
its anus, then it goes
through its whole body.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.920
It goes through the gill,
not threaded all the way
through the fish!

16:34.960 --> 16:37.520
-If I were to dry you...
-Can somebody come and open
the lid?

16:37.560 --> 16:40.120
-No, I'm busy with him.
-Open the lid!

16:40.160 --> 16:41.400
(BLEEP)

16:41.440 --> 16:43.520
-(SPLASH)
-Oh, yeah.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.600
-Admire.
-Now what do you do?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.800
Hang it on here.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.920
JEREMY: Eventually
the loading and the hanging
were complete

16:54.960 --> 16:57.200
and we were ready.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.760
OK, it's time now...

17:00.800 --> 17:03.600
Nobody's ever said this
on a car show before.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.440
...to save the world.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.040
(IGNITION,
ENGINE CHOKES)

17:09.400 --> 17:12.120
(ENGINE JUDDERING)

17:15.440 --> 17:17.920
-(ENGINE FIRES UP)
-There you go.

17:17.960 --> 17:21.240
Right, forward into saving
the world. This is it.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.160
Oh, my God! Oh. Oh.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.320
Stupid...
What the hell is...?

17:29.360 --> 17:31.120
Oh, Lord above!

17:31.160 --> 17:34.080
What manner of thing
is happening here?

17:35.080 --> 17:36.560
Still, could be worse.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.520
Oh, it's steering me,
I'm not steering it.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.960
It is steering me! Oh!

17:42.000 --> 17:46.680
-Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with great...
-(SPLOSH)

17:46.720 --> 17:48.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with great...

17:51.720 --> 17:54.320
It is with great pride
and humility

17:54.360 --> 17:57.480
that I accept this award
for... Urgh!

18:01.240 --> 18:02.680
Ah, Tarmac!

18:02.720 --> 18:04.040
That's better!

18:09.440 --> 18:13.920
JEREMY: Our mercy mission
would take us through
the city of Maputo

18:13.960 --> 18:18.440
and then 200 miles north,
to the tiny village of Bingo.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.320
The great thing about
this particular vehicle

18:23.360 --> 18:27.240
is that it has a 3.2-litre
four-cylinder diesel engine.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.720
That's a great deal of power,
it'll get me there quickly.

18:30.760 --> 18:36.680
This is what Angelina
and Bob Geldof and Bono
don't realise.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.680
It's all very well singing
songs and adopting children.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.640
What you actually need is
a big, powerful engine,

18:43.680 --> 18:45.520
and that's what I've got
in my Hardbody.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.440
Everybody I pass, you can see
the light dawning in their
eyes.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.680
"Why didn't we
think of that?"

18:54.720 --> 18:57.840
Every morning in future
there'll be a fleet of
fishing boats

18:57.880 --> 18:59.320
coming in to shore here

18:59.360 --> 19:01.160
and a fleet of these bikes

19:01.200 --> 19:02.960
waiting to collect the fish

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
and transport it inland,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.640
And it's what, 200 miles?

19:07.680 --> 19:12.080
I reckon on a bike,
a good rider could get in

19:12.120 --> 19:15.320
two or even three fish trips
a day.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.520
See, it's brilliant,
isn't it?

19:19.560 --> 19:21.600
Yeah. It's a brilliant idea!

19:21.640 --> 19:24.680
You're gonna want to do it!
It's a great business!

19:24.720 --> 19:27.320
Yeah, you see!
This is like Lions' Den,

19:27.360 --> 19:29.280
Dragons' Den, whatever.
The Den.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.360
That show with Alan Sugar on.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.720
Temperatures and pressures
are OK.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.360
Tank is full of water.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.320
Quick look at my fish.
Yes, there's one.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.680
He's looking pretty happy.
Why wouldn't he be?
He's in the sea.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.680
He doesn't know
he's in a car.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.480
Fish are not, you know...

19:46.520 --> 19:48.120
They don't have
a big intellect.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.760
Overtaking
the Leaning Bus of Pisa!

19:57.680 --> 20:00.520
So here we are.
We've done 40 miles already.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.960
We're on a velvet-smooth,
almost Austrian road,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.240
heading towards Bingo.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.440
We should be there
in a couple of hours.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.960
Easiest thing I've ever done.
Easiest.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.200
In fact, since things
were going so smoothly,

20:15.240 --> 20:17.920
I decided to amuse myself.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.600
Ready, steady and
brake-testing James May.

20:25.760 --> 20:29.920
-Git!
-(CHORTLES)

20:29.960 --> 20:32.200
You're not helping with
the transport of my fish.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.120
This is supposed to be
a group effort.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.680
Don't be
such a petulant child.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.240
Oh, someone's fallen over
in the road. Nothing I can
do.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.400
(JAMES CACKLES)

20:49.400 --> 20:51.480
A few miles further on,
though,

20:51.520 --> 20:54.360
the smooth Tarmac ran out.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.760
And because Hammond had
rejected my anus suggestion

20:57.800 --> 20:59.600
and used gills instead,

20:59.640 --> 21:01.680
it caused him some problems.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.760
JEREMY: Hammond, you just
lost 90% of your fish.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.960
Oh, no, did I?

21:12.120 --> 21:14.720
Oh, he's lost another one!

21:14.760 --> 21:17.320
JAMES: I've just run over
a fish. Should I worry?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.560
Oh, mate, you're gonna be
running over more than one.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.400
Hammond is losing them
at a rate of knots.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.880
Two more just went there,
Hammond.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.600
Oh, God!

21:28.640 --> 21:30.280
And another one.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.280
He's gonna have...
And another one.

21:32.320 --> 21:34.800
...no fish at all.
And another.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.760
JAMES: This fish delivery was
supposed to be targeted.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.600
What you're doing is
carpet-bombing Mozambique
with bream.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.640
RICHARD: It's the principle
I'm proving.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.280
I'm not trying
to feed them all.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.000
I'm trying to show them
how to feed themselves.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.000
What a blithering idiot.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.080
The inside of the
windscreen's filthy

21:55.120 --> 21:58.760
because of... dollops of
sea water hitting it.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.640
I'm delighted to say
it's now spitting with rain,

22:18.680 --> 22:22.040
which of course is filling up
my water bucket.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.720
That's the sort of recycling
that will leave Prince
Charles breathless.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.520
When I go for my knighthood,
he'll probably bring it up,
I should imagine.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.040
(MIMICS CHARLES) What gave
you the idea of recycling?

22:36.080 --> 22:40.280
I think this is so inventive,
it really is.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.920
-Urgh!
-Sorry.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.480
-No point drying them if
you're gonna soak them!
-Sorry.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.960
Argh!

22:50.000 --> 22:51.840
Sorry, Hammond.
Did some of that go on you ?

22:51.880 --> 22:55.800
RICHARD: What's the point of
me drying fish if you then
get them wet in a puddle?

22:58.080 --> 23:03.040
JEREMY: It was still another
150 miles to Bingo.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.360
But we were confident
that even on these roads,

23:06.400 --> 23:08.600
we'd get there by nightfall.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.600
Soon, though, the going
started to get much worse.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.920
JAMES: Not so good.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.600
Steady, steady.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.640
Shit!

23:23.680 --> 23:25.280
That's a massive rut. Oh, no!

23:31.760 --> 23:33.400
Argh! (BLEEP)

23:38.040 --> 23:40.000
Come on!

23:42.080 --> 23:44.480
Hammond cannot possibly
make this.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.480
Oh, no! Not again!

23:47.520 --> 23:50.320
It's getting quite struggly
now for him.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.600
But actually it was the
ruggedly dependable Mercedes

23:55.640 --> 23:57.720
that was the first to crack.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.080
(ENGINE CUTS OUT)

24:01.280 --> 24:03.640
JAMES: That was going well.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.520
JEREMY:
What's the matter, May?

24:05.560 --> 24:07.840
It cut out when I went
through the puddle.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.840
Getting water on something
or in something.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.200
I'm trying to work out
what I can do about that.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.480
Nothing.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.200
However, because we were
all working as a team,

24:21.240 --> 24:24.040
we had to wait until
his engine dried out.

24:24.080 --> 24:26.720
(ENGINE STARTS)

24:26.760 --> 24:28.560
Right, let's go.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.440

There's nothing I can do.
Sorry, I have to wait for
a minute and a half.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.000
How have I put up with him
for so long?

25:12.800 --> 25:14.720
The slow progress of
the Mercedes

25:14.760 --> 25:16.840
was now causing me problems,

25:16.880 --> 25:21.320
because the skies were dry
and my water bucket was
nearly empty.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.400
He keeps breaking down
in front of me and then going,

25:26.440 --> 25:28.360
"It's a minute and a half.
You have to wait."

25:28.400 --> 25:30.800

and a half, it's about
15 minutes.

afford to wait for him
bumbling around.

No, you do need more ice.
You need more water.

work as a team and we are
working as a team.

-And the teamwork is,

-Yeah, as a team.

that that is normal water

37:13.440 --> 37:16.040
Sometime,
probably in the next hour,

37:16.080 --> 37:19.120
or the next week,
we'll flick the switch."

37:21.320 --> 37:23.320
Oh! Bollocks!

37:48.640 --> 37:50.680
Sod 'em!

37:52.640 --> 37:55.880
JAMES: Fire taken care of,
I was now back on the move.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.640
All right, fellas?

37:59.680 --> 38:01.600
I'm sort of assuming
the fish are boys.

38:01.640 --> 38:06.240
But some of them must be
girls. Do you get girl and
boy fishies? You must do.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.000
(HORN BEEPS)

38:08.040 --> 38:10.680
He needs to watch where
he's going, that boy.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.320
JEREMY: Meanwhile,
up ahead in the Hardbody...

38:26.720 --> 38:28.760
...I'd run into
a spot of bother.

38:36.920 --> 38:41.160
-What's up?
-Ice machine's broken.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.560
How does sawing your bonnet
up mend your ice machine?

38:43.600 --> 38:47.640
I've had a brilliant idea and
I'm glad you're here, actually,
cos you can give me a hand.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.000
No, seriously, James.
Most of our fish are in...

38:53.600 --> 38:55.240
The good fish are in here.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.240
(TOOTS HORN)

38:59.280 --> 39:03.120
90% of our fish are in the
back of my pick-up truck

39:03.160 --> 39:04.920
and he's just driven off.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.120
(Hammering)

39:11.280 --> 39:12.720
-(MOTORBIKE APPROACHES)
-There's Hammond.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.040
-Hello.
-Hello.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.000
-Behold, my gen--
-Yeah, fascinating.

39:21.880 --> 39:25.760
Well, there we are.
He's just done 100 yards
without falling off.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.400
Eventually, my new fish
preservation solution

39:31.440 --> 39:32.760
was up and running.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.960
What I've done is I've rerouted
the exhaust through the bonnet,
over the cabbie

39:42.000 --> 39:44.120
into the load area
where the fish are,

39:44.160 --> 39:46.360
which is now covered with
a tonneau cover.

39:48.440 --> 39:50.160
Then I've adjusted the
fuelling on the engine,

39:50.200 --> 39:54.720
so now it's producing thick,
lumpy black smoke

39:54.760 --> 39:57.200
which of course is smoking
the fish.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.800
And that's good for
the environment.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.160
Because normally
you'd have to have
a smokery, a factory,

40:04.200 --> 40:08.320
and then you have to
transport the fish to
wherever it is they're going.

40:08.360 --> 40:13.320
But what I'm doing here
is I'm making kippers
as I drive along.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.120
Coal-rolled kippers.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.400
(ACCELERATES)

40:17.440 --> 40:21.360
You'd buy those.
I know I would.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.440
Further ahead, Bono and
Angelina were discussing
the distance left to cover.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.800
By my very rough reckoning,

40:28.840 --> 40:31.440
because my speedo and
my mileometer aren't working,

40:31.480 --> 40:36.400
I think we've got about
somewhere between 70 and
80 kilometres to go to Bingo.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.360
Why do they have to live
so bloody far away?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.960
Any fish left?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.680
Yes. I have two.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.360
But I think it's better to
arrive with two fish

40:46.400 --> 40:48.560
than not to arrive with ten.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.000
That's a parable.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.800
Yes, it sounds
positively Biblical, I think.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.840
I don't like
the look of this.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.320
RICHARD: Oh, bollocks!

41:03.040 --> 41:05.040
Geez, that's a big one.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.000
What is this stuff?

41:17.040 --> 41:19.360
JEREMY: Ooh, hello!

41:19.400 --> 41:21.880
My colleagues.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.000
JAMES: Is that you, Clarkson?
-Sure is.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.160
Move your bloody car, May!

41:32.200 --> 41:35.400
What a muppet. He's got
a four-wheel-drive
pick-up truck!

41:37.120 --> 41:40.640
What are those bits of
scaffolding coming out of
your bonnet for?

41:40.680 --> 41:44.320
JEREMY: I'm making kippers,
or I would be if you hadn't
have blocked the way.

41:44.360 --> 41:46.080
Did he say "making kippers"?

41:46.120 --> 41:47.720
RICHARD: They look like
the handrails out of
a disabled shower

41:47.760 --> 41:49.880
from back here.
What are they?

41:49.920 --> 41:52.800
-They're exhaust pipes.
-What?

41:52.840 --> 41:56.040
Ice machine broke. I'm now
turning them into smoked
fish.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.920
This is a kipper factory.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.520
Hang on. You're smoking them
in diesel smoke?

42:00.560 --> 42:03.720
-Yes.
-Eh?

42:03.760 --> 42:06.320
-It's just smoke.
-Why do you think that's
never been done before?

42:06.360 --> 42:09.360
-Nobody's thought of it.
-No. Because it's vile!

42:09.400 --> 42:13.240
Well, you eat wood smoke.
That's disgusting. A bonfire!

42:13.280 --> 42:16.720
Do you think oak-smoked fish
is the same as diesel-smoked
fish?

42:16.760 --> 42:18.600
It's coal-rolled kippers!

42:18.640 --> 42:21.200
-It's under there smoking?
-No.
I've turned the engine off.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.960
JEREMY: This interesting
discussion was not helping
the people of Bingo.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.760
So we knuckled down to the
business of getting through
the mud.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.400
I'm gonna go behind
the trees, cos I'm narrow,
so I can.

42:34.960 --> 42:37.720
Oh! That's a thorn tree! No!

42:39.080 --> 42:40.120
Oh, Christ!

42:41.600 --> 42:43.160
Get off!

42:43.200 --> 42:46.080
Meanwhile, May made me
give him a tow.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.640
Right, James May,
are you ready?

42:49.680 --> 42:51.440
Go!

42:57.280 --> 42:58.960
Yes!

43:01.680 --> 43:03.480
Come on, keep going,
keep going.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.680
Hang on, I'm stuck here.
I've bottomed out.

43:07.720 --> 43:12.200
And that's pretty much all I
did for the rest of the day.

43:15.320 --> 43:17.200
JAMES: So close!

43:18.600 --> 43:21.200
Here we go again
to tow him out.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.680
(RATTLING)

43:25.720 --> 43:27.520
Listen to that CV joint.

43:29.960 --> 43:34.960
Damn him and his stupid
aquarium which weighs
1800 tons!

43:43.840 --> 43:45.440
JAMES: That's the most stuck
it's ever been.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.800
Oh, for Christ's sake!

43:48.840 --> 43:54.640
Luckily Ewan McHammond
was always on hand to provide
some comic relief.

43:54.680 --> 43:57.280
A-ha! I can go up the middle!
You see!

44:00.320 --> 44:02.080
(SNIGGERS)

44:05.920 --> 44:10.080
You do realise it's entirely
possible that we won't end up

44:10.120 --> 44:12.160
in Bingo even today?

44:13.320 --> 44:15.560
Ah...

44:15.600 --> 44:17.000
Half past three.

44:17.040 --> 44:20.280
And we have done
since we set off at
seven o'clock this morning...

44:21.880 --> 44:24.040
...52 miles.

44:25.880 --> 44:29.520
That meant there was another
50 miles to go.

44:29.560 --> 44:33.360
Fortunately, however,
there was no more mud.

44:33.400 --> 44:37.440
Unfortunately, it was
replaced by this.

44:39.920 --> 44:43.000
The wettest road
I'd ever seen.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.680
Oh, my word,
this is a deep one.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.600
Discs locked, low range.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.320
Oh, wow!

45:06.160 --> 45:08.920
There's water!
A lot of water has come in!

45:11.000 --> 45:14.360
I am up to my anus now
in water.

45:17.800 --> 45:21.320
RICHARD: As Jeremy waded
through the lake,

45:21.360 --> 45:24.200
I found a narrow path
round the edge.

45:24.240 --> 45:25.880
Aha-ha!

45:25.920 --> 45:27.360
Look what
clever Hammond's done.

45:30.480 --> 45:33.200
What an incredible machine
this is.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.200
Look at this, Hammond.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.360
Oh! Oh!

45:42.400 --> 45:44.640
-You've got
all water in it, mate.
-Yes, exactly.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.720
It's come up above
the level of my doors.

45:46.760 --> 45:49.320
Have you checked for fish?

45:49.360 --> 45:51.520
Look, don't be stupid.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.480
Given what we're doing...

45:53.520 --> 45:55.680
JEREMY:
With two of us safely across,

45:55.720 --> 45:59.120
all eyes were now on the
hopeless Macquarium.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.840
James, it is extremely deep.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.360
JAMES: Yeah, that's OK. I'll
do just a gentle bow wave

46:05.400 --> 46:08.040
like they do
at off-road school.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.480
JEREMY: Here he comes.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.480
There you go.

46:15.520 --> 46:17.440
(GURGLING)

46:19.400 --> 46:20.760
Oh, shit!

46:23.000 --> 46:24.200
Shit.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.800
Help!

46:27.840 --> 46:29.440
RICHARD: All your fish
are gonna escape!

46:29.480 --> 46:33.480
-Oh, bollocks.
JEREMY: Don't let the fresh
water get in your salt water.

46:33.520 --> 46:36.000
I don't give a toss about
that. Come and get me!

46:36.040 --> 46:38.120
I have rescued you
one million times

46:38.160 --> 46:41.040
and I'm not towing
that damn thing any more.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.280
You are breaking the CV
joints in my Hardbody.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.840
Having finally got fed up
with him,

46:47.880 --> 46:50.560
Hammond and I decided
to get radical.

46:54.840 --> 46:57.560
So that night,
as James slept...

47:00.360 --> 47:02.360
...we modified his car
slightly.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.320
(DRILLING)

47:22.960 --> 47:26.360
This made James
very unpleased.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.800
JAMES: You bastards!

47:28.840 --> 47:31.720
I hate you! Both of you!

47:33.960 --> 47:36.320
You utter bastards!

47:36.360 --> 47:41.000
Listen. I am prepared to tow
your bootful of water.
That's important.

47:41.040 --> 47:42.840
I'm not gonna
tow a dead engine

47:42.880 --> 47:46.000
that's full of water, as well.
That's just a waste of fuel.

47:46.040 --> 47:49.240
Rubbish. It wasn't dead.
I could have mended that
once we'd dragged it out.

47:49.280 --> 47:52.240
It's just the ignition.
I've done it five times
already!

47:52.280 --> 47:54.560
You complete moron!

47:54.600 --> 47:57.520
I hope you get bilharzia
of the ball sack!

47:57.560 --> 47:59.680
Right, that's it.
He's asked for it.

47:59.720 --> 48:01.880
(ACCELERATES)

48:05.000 --> 48:06.840
Funny. Very funny.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.240
Bloody mad.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.920
I think you're following him
too closely.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.960
Why don't you sod off?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.160
Has it affected
the handling?

48:28.240 --> 48:29.440
What was that?

48:31.480 --> 48:35.680
Fearful that James was about
to catch cancer from my
coal-rolling...

48:39.840 --> 48:42.880
...I invited him to enter
my Hardbody.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.720
And was he grateful?
No.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.680
(CLATTERING)

48:49.720 --> 48:52.080
The ride in this thing
is appalling.

48:52.120 --> 48:54.080
Why is it so bad?

48:54.120 --> 48:56.440
If an ambulance came
to rescue you,

48:56.480 --> 48:59.120
would you complain about
the quality of the ambulance?

48:59.160 --> 49:00.760
No.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.040
So why are you complaining
about everything I've done
for you?

49:03.080 --> 49:06.920
Because you're rescuing me
from effective injury
that you inflicted.

49:06.960 --> 49:08.800
I'd still complain about
the man who mugged me

49:08.840 --> 49:10.800
if he then said,
"I'll help you out, mate."
I'd still complain.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.440
JEREMY: Let's be brutally
honest, shall we?

49:14.480 --> 49:17.480
Your car's been a terrible
nuisance all the way along.

49:17.520 --> 49:18.920
Not to me.

49:18.960 --> 49:21.480
It has to me cos I've had
to wait for it for days.

49:21.520 --> 49:25.560
You're so noble, I won't
forget to mention you
in my speech.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.440
You're not getting
a Nobel Prize.

49:28.480 --> 49:31.760
-Why not?
-Because you're ending with
three-quarters of a car.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.960
You don't get the prize
for how much car you bring.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.760
You get the prize
for bringing the fish.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.640
Don't forget,
you're towing my fish,

49:39.680 --> 49:42.080
ie, the fish
that are still edible.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.640
-Mine are edible.
-No, they're not.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.360
-They are!
-I can assure you
they're not.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.240
JEREMY: It was a shame about
James's bad mood

49:49.280 --> 49:52.480
because we were
on the verge of success.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.040
Come on!

49:55.080 --> 49:58.680
Sure, our plan to feed
the world had been beset
on all sides

49:58.720 --> 50:01.040
by much discomfort...

50:01.080 --> 50:02.560
Urgh! Bollocks!

50:03.640 --> 50:05.160
...and many setbacks.

50:05.200 --> 50:08.200
We've got eight, plus one
that got out in the boat.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.080
I am up to my anus now
in water.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.360
Oh, God!

50:14.400 --> 50:17.560
There'd been
some terrible smells too.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.640
Oh! Argh!

50:19.680 --> 50:21.800
And several accidents.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.280
Some of which
were quite funny.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.200
-(HEAVY CLUNK)
-Bollocks!

50:28.240 --> 50:31.520
(HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER)

50:31.560 --> 50:35.880
But despite everything, we
were now just a few miles
from Bingo.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.080
I think, if we're going to
be sensible,

50:40.120 --> 50:43.520
what we should have done
is had a pick-up truck

50:43.560 --> 50:45.760
with an aquarium in the back.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.160
You sort of have now.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.200
JEREMY: That motorcycle
has been remarkable.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.360
800 quid from a supermarket.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.400
I know Hammond's been
obsessing about how

50:58.440 --> 51:01.280
he doesn't look
like Ewan McGregor
in "The Long Way Down,"

51:01.320 --> 51:06.000
but to me he does, cos it's
a motorcycle and they're all
exactly the same in my mind.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.280
We could make a film of all
of his crashes and call it
Wrong Way Up.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.240
(LAUGHTER)

51:13.560 --> 51:15.280
I'm going to tell you
one thing.

51:15.320 --> 51:19.440
You know normally people
from TV or film or whatever

51:19.480 --> 51:22.880
come out to Africa
to do charitable work?

51:22.920 --> 51:25.320
They're photographed by
Hello! magazine

51:25.360 --> 51:28.200
and then it's back to the
hotel, Châteauneuf-du-Pape,

51:28.240 --> 51:31.000
-fly home to get the OBE.
-Right.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.760
They don't actually do
what we've done, do they?

51:33.800 --> 51:35.280
No, I don't think so.

51:35.320 --> 51:41.160
I've never seen Victoria
Beckham trying to pull
half a Mercedes

51:41.200 --> 51:42.880
across Mozambique.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.400
Bingo!

51:53.600 --> 51:56.080
There it is!
Our quest is at an end!

51:58.320 --> 52:02.000
Sir Jeremy and the Nobel
Award-winning James May,

52:02.040 --> 52:03.760
and Richard Hammond,
are arriving!

52:05.600 --> 52:08.600
Hello. Have we got good news
for you guys!

52:10.680 --> 52:13.840
Aware that our fish
may cause a stampede,

52:13.880 --> 52:17.800
we found a spot with enough
space to accommodate
the crowds.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.800
Are you ready?

52:19.840 --> 52:21.880
This will get them running
over here, you watch.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
Oh, look at that!

52:28.800 --> 52:31.600
Hundreds and hundreds of
delicious fishes.

52:31.640 --> 52:34.720
Diesel-infused kippers.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.120
James, however, was not
so happy about the condition
of his fish.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.440
And for some reason,
he blamed me.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.360
All that messing around
and dragging around,
you killed them.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.320
Those were all alive
this morning!

52:50.360 --> 52:51.960
All of them are dead!

52:52.000 --> 52:53.240
How do you know
all are?

52:53.280 --> 52:55.320
Cos they're floating.
That's what fish do.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.840
I've kept those alive for
three days, you muppet.

52:57.880 --> 53:00.080
JEREMY:
How have I killed them?

53:00.120 --> 53:01.760
You did this.
You dragged it along,

53:01.800 --> 53:04.040
bouncing it around too much,
and not thinking about the fish.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.280
You finished them off!

53:06.320 --> 53:10.600
This, though, was no time
to get bogged down with
who'd killed James's fish,

53:10.640 --> 53:12.320
because it was him.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.840
So, we got on with the job
of setting up our stalls.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.080
-Is that straight?
RICHARD: No.

53:18.120 --> 53:22.080
And eventually we were ready
for the crowds
to descend.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.000
(FLIES BUZZING)

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
(BUZZING INTENSIFIES)

53:41.360 --> 53:42.920
Customer. Customer.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.800
Nobody's interested.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.320
So, we moved on to the next
phase of our plan.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.240
Is the man from Hello!
magazine getting these shots?

54:05.280 --> 54:06.400
-He's there.
-Oh, yeah.

54:08.240 --> 54:11.320
Look concerned. Let's see
your concerned face.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.640
Can you make sure you get
plenty of local people
in the background

54:19.680 --> 54:21.280
so it's obvious
I'm in Africa?

54:21.320 --> 54:22.480
Thank you.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.280
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

54:24.320 --> 54:28.120
And then with not a single
fish given away,
but the pictures taken,

54:28.160 --> 54:30.960
there was only one thing
left to do.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.880
Chaps,
let's get the helicopter.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.560
(ENGINE WHIRRING)
