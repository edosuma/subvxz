01:14.199 --> 01:16.451
Do you think I should
get her ears pierced?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.453
- I don't know!
- Yeah!

01:18.537 --> 01:21.832
I didn't get mine pierced
until I was 14, I think?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.375
Yeah, I think that's right.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.544
Yes, she's Grandma's little angel.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.713
Right? Grandma's little angel.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.923
- She sleeps so well.
- She does.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.676
Just share that with everybody.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.679
Let me get my phone
and we'll take a picture. Keep on going.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.600
Okay, look over here, guys.
One, two, three...

01:39.683 --> 01:41.476
Smile, Faith!

01:43.145 --> 01:45.814
- Dad is gonna document this whole life.
- That's right.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.275
- Still a tiny, tiny, thing.
- I'll take a selfie.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.402
Whose nose do you think she has?

01:51.153 --> 01:54.239
- Yours.
- I think it might be Omar's.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.992
Grandpa.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.619
It's me.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.371
Look at this. Look, look, look.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.583
She always grabs my finger.
No matter what she does.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.085
Is that your happy face?
She likes to grab your finger.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.880
She loves it.
She just holds my hand.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.424
Look at this, look at this.
She won't let go!

02:12.508 --> 02:15.636
- So funny!
- We're in a good family!

02:16.428 --> 02:18.263
<i>I'm sorry, baby Faith.</i>

02:19.348 --> 02:21.058
<i>God took your daddy.</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:25.103
<i>♪ Do you know the Muffin Man? ♪</i>

02:25.187 --> 02:28.148
<i>♪ The Muffin Man, the Muffin Man? ♪</i>

02:28.232 --> 02:30.526
<i>♪ Do you know the Muffin Man? ♪</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:32.194
<i>♪ Who lives on Drury Lane? ♪</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:36.073
- Who loves you?
- Mama!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.407
Where are you?

02:38.075 --> 02:39.409
<i>I love you, Grandpa.</i>

02:39.493 --> 02:42.579
<i>Now, he's taken you.</i>

02:44.665 --> 02:48.085
"Blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.212
For it is not the will of my Father
who is in Heaven

02:50.295 --> 02:52.172
that one of these little ones
should perish."

02:52.256 --> 02:54.216
Then why is she in the box?

02:54.299 --> 02:56.802
Where was our Father
when she got sick?

02:57.636 --> 03:00.681
Please rise and join me
in reciting Psalm 23

03:00.764 --> 03:06.311
from the Old Testament for the spirit
of Faith Elizabeth Amable-Amo-Fareed.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.025
- "The Lord is my shepherd."
- "The Lord is my shepherd."

03:12.109 --> 03:15.153
- "I shall not want."
- "I shall not want."

03:16.154 --> 03:19.241
"He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures."

03:19.324 --> 03:22.786
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

03:22.870 --> 03:25.330
"He restoreth my soul."

03:25.414 --> 03:28.709
Who kills innocent healers and children?

03:28.792 --> 03:31.962
Daddy. We have to have faith.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.964
I have no faith.

04:25.641 --> 04:26.934
Breakfast!

04:36.527 --> 04:39.738
Sheila Tranquinila,
how does your garden grow?

04:40.739 --> 04:43.742
Well, the rabbits seem to be enjoying it.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.621
I'll pick up some meshed wire.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.165
Hmm. That's what you said last summer.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.583
Well, last summer I lied.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.919
This summer, I promise.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.638
I really do need
that wire mesh.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.183
That Ladies Home and Garden contest
is fast approaching.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.652
How do I help you?

05:23.156 --> 05:27.244
Ask Whozit, your Eternal Love Lord.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.914
You know, if you make fun
of my faith one more time,

05:30.998 --> 05:33.166
I'm going to stop speaking to you.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.546
Let me think about that.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.550
I'd better get to work.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.552
That's a really good idea.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.596
You are getting on my last nerve.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.619
Be ready to forgive again and again...

06:11.705 --> 06:14.041
And again. Amen.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.008
Oh, God.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.138
Good morning, Mr. Amable-Amo.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.600
Would you like to be undisturbed?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.146
Disturb me at will, Karen.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.400
Um...

07:22.484 --> 07:25.320
<i>Mr. Amable-Amo,
your daughter is here.</i>

07:25.404 --> 07:27.072
Send her in, please.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.115
Hi, Daddy.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.199
Hi.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.619
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Thanks for seeing me.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.788
Oh, please.
As if I wouldn't see my baby.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.625
How are you, huh? Sit down.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.129
- A little situation.
- Oh.

07:42.212 --> 07:47.968
The pipes in the school's bathroom burst
and flooded the kitchen!

07:48.051 --> 07:50.804
- I'm really sorry, baby.
- Yeah, well.

07:50.888 --> 07:54.892
Uh, can you run an after-school program
if you're not actually open after school?

07:56.393 --> 07:58.645
How much is it gonna cost to fix?

08:00.105 --> 08:02.399
Um, just $5,000.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.902
But I'm already three months late

08:04.985 --> 08:06.695
on my mortgage payment, Daddy.
I'm so...

08:08.071 --> 08:10.073
I see. Your mom and I could help.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.659
No, you already do so much.

08:12.743 --> 08:16.830
We can do more.

08:16.914 --> 08:20.626
Hey, Daniel. Hey, Bruce.
What's going on? Janice!

08:20.709 --> 08:21.960
Oh, Daddy.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.504
Come on, baby. That's okay.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.382
That's me. Best job ever.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.176
Oh, I love you.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.097
So, Mr. A... Oh, sorry! Interrupting!
Nuisance guy! Private moment!

08:34.181 --> 08:37.768
No, no! I'm sorry. He's...
My dad, he's just...

08:38.602 --> 08:42.688
I... I... I wish I knew more dads
who were... just.

08:43.315 --> 08:47.611
This is Gabe Berkowitz,
my new Assistant VP for Compliance.

08:49.154 --> 08:53.075
This is my daughter.
Audrey Amable-Amo-Fareed.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.327
Hi. Of course. Hi.

08:55.410 --> 09:01.500
Words are worthless to say anything
meaningful about your losses, so I'll...

09:03.335 --> 09:05.420
So I'll stop trying to use 'em. Words.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.214
I know.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.717
Okay. I love you, Daddy. Bye.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.762
Um, you know, your dad told me
about the work that you do.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.890
If you ever need a mountain biker

09:16.974 --> 09:19.142
who's also a world-class
ukulele player...

09:20.561 --> 09:21.728
- ...I'll be there.
- Oh.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.982
- Cool.
- Okay.

09:42.124 --> 09:45.043
Well, hello there, hot dog! Huh?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.212
What are you doing here?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.756
Where'd you come from? Huh?

09:49.840 --> 09:54.178
Well, some very inclusive person
is missing you.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.306
Come here, little belly.
Come here, little belly.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.100
Oh, that's a little belly boy.
Wanna get some water?

10:07.774 --> 10:09.651
Anything else
you need from me, Mr. A?

10:09.735 --> 10:14.156
Yes. I want the bank to do more.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.577
More for who? Or whom.
Is it who or whom?

10:18.660 --> 10:20.662
Whom. Everybody.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.581
- Hmm.
- Our community.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.416
Audrey, my daughter is...

10:24.499 --> 10:26.752
Well, your daughter's
gonna miss another payment.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.587
The thing is, the examiner
isn't gonna care.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.380
He's gonna foreclose.
And we are a bank.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.217
Oh, really? Gee! Since when?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.844
The thing is, they will shut you down,
if you don't follow the rules.

10:35.928 --> 10:38.347
- When's our criminal defense due?
- Two days.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.141
Okay. Well, let's get ready
to be examined.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.726
Shave all your body hair.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.981
Okay, okay.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.776
Fist bump? Good talk.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.130
Oh, boy.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.513
"Joe, it's God. I have chosen you
for a special mission.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.057
I could have done
the whole burning bush thing,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.726
but all the plants in your office
are artificial."

11:27.020 --> 11:30.023
Um, very funny!

11:30.732 --> 11:33.777
Yeah. Thank you.

11:33.861 --> 11:38.991
Um, whoever hacked into my computer
and left me an attractive

11:39.074 --> 11:43.912
and grammatically correct
message from, uh...

11:45.539 --> 11:49.293
Oh. It's a bad idea.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.421
Whoever hacked my computer,
uh, no need to confess.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.922
Please, just un-hack it.

11:54.006 --> 11:58.051
And, uh, thank you all
for your kind attention to my...

11:58.802 --> 12:01.054
psychotic outbursts.

12:05.976 --> 12:11.481
All right. Whoever this is,
you want a playmate? Here you go.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.610
"Hey there, God.
About time I heard from you.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.613
Let's meet for lunch to discuss..."

12:19.948 --> 12:21.033
Oh!

12:22.701 --> 12:25.913
"Resist the sarcasm, Joe.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.208
Rather, behold and believe!"

12:29.291 --> 12:32.044
Karen, my printer prints in black, right?

12:32.711 --> 12:34.379
Yes, sir. Problem?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.092
There's someone that's trying...

12:40.177 --> 12:41.845
Ah, what?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.096
What?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.057
Thanks, Karen.

12:46.058 --> 12:49.937
"I'll give you a more traditional sign.
A big white dove will tap your window,

12:50.020 --> 12:52.189
wink at you, flap three times, fly away."

13:00.781 --> 13:03.367
Winking white dove drone.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.702
Very impressive.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.746
Hey, Gabe!

13:08.330 --> 13:11.208
Are you in control of all of this?

13:13.502 --> 13:14.461
Oh!

13:17.381 --> 13:21.218
Oh! I'll call the copy machine people.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.721
It's okay. It's just being innovative.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.560
First American Bank Examination Report?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.064
"I want you free
to concentrate on your mission."

13:34.147 --> 13:35.649
Well, what's my mission?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.319
Wait. Puppy dog.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.948
Hmm. Wait.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.118
Sand Wedge.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.328
Go give that to Joe.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.956
Good boy!

13:51.039 --> 13:52.082
Good boy!

13:52.165 --> 13:55.294
<i>You have reached
Sheila Amable-Amo.</i>

13:55.377 --> 13:57.045
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

14:06.471 --> 14:07.556
Hi.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.308
What have you got?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.770
Huh? What's this?

14:20.027 --> 14:23.405
"Sometimes we forget to remember
what we have known all of our lives.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.157
Such as the power of faith

14:25.240 --> 14:27.576
to fill us with the power
to change our lives.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.163
In an instant of revelation."

14:35.501 --> 14:39.505
Do you have to travel to the revelation
or can I stay in the air conditioning?

14:43.509 --> 14:47.095
Well, you know, honey, I've always
enjoyed the fact you're a little nuts.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.014
It's part of your charm.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.059
So, uh...

14:52.142 --> 14:53.977
- What's the mission?
- Yes.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.066
It's so ludicrous
that you're gonna say what I did.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.611
How could God,
given all the strife in the world,

15:02.694 --> 15:04.279
care about such a mission?

15:05.405 --> 15:09.034
Wouldn't, couldn't, so doesn't.

15:09.117 --> 15:13.914
Okay. So, the mission is
three, two, one...

15:16.458 --> 15:19.294
Win the Golf Championship
of the World Entire.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.173
I told you!

15:26.134 --> 15:28.595
That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard

15:28.679 --> 15:31.181
since probably the last
most ridiculous thing!

15:35.519 --> 15:37.104
Ah!

15:40.941 --> 15:42.609
I don't know if this is relevant,

15:42.693 --> 15:44.820
but there's a really big dove
on your head.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.072
- Is it pooping?
- No.

15:47.823 --> 15:49.950
It just winked at me.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.497
It did that to me too!

15:56.665 --> 16:01.420
Oh, Joseph, I haven't seen that smile
in such a long time.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.717
I'm not smiling. I'm grimacing.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.637
No, <i>querido.</i> That's a smile.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.308
I'm a little scared.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.475
Me too.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.898
But I figure that's par for the course.

16:35.454 --> 16:38.040
We haven't had this much to drink, right?

16:38.874 --> 16:39.875
No.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.837
Can we agree that what just happened
just happened?

16:47.549 --> 16:49.384
What are we gonna do?

16:52.137 --> 16:56.725
Well, I could take you
to the mental hospital or...

17:00.479 --> 17:05.817
you could accept
that not a prankster, not a hacker,

17:05.901 --> 17:11.573
but the Almighty... chose you.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.160
And you could follow the instructions.

17:15.827 --> 17:20.582
You believe that this was...
is an act of God?

17:23.919 --> 17:25.921
I not only believe.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.132
I am overjoyed

17:30.092 --> 17:34.096
that God has chosen Joseph Amable-Amo.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.978
And maybe it's no accident

17:41.061 --> 17:46.233
that your name means
what God needs you to be.

17:47.693 --> 17:51.280
Joe Kind-Love.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.574
But golf?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.474
I think you should go.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.146
All right.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.077
Are they kidding?

18:48.253 --> 18:49.296
Okay.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.093
Oh, wow.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.972
Could be someone's
a fabulous bird trainer...

19:02.267 --> 19:03.435
Or not.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.064
Boy.

19:39.388 --> 19:40.389
Wow.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.934
Could be set for a weird zombie movie...

19:53.110 --> 19:54.236
Or not.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.281
Hey, it's you again.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.993
What have you got there?

20:01.869 --> 20:04.663
Hey! What's this? What's this?

20:09.418 --> 20:10.752
"Amable-Amo Joseph.

20:10.836 --> 20:13.463
Kind-Love Joe, hit some warm-up shots.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.883
Dog's name is Sand Wedge."

20:16.800 --> 20:20.596
You Sandy or Wedgie for short?

20:21.680 --> 20:23.682
Ah. Sandy, of course.

20:24.766 --> 20:28.020
Wedgie would be a little risqué
for a divine operation like this.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.715
Aw, man!

21:01.261 --> 21:03.347
Phew!

21:28.205 --> 21:32.459
Not bad! For a stove-up
old banker.

21:32.543 --> 21:33.794
Herb.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.379
Joe Amable-Amo.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.549
I reckon the Almighty Lord
already told you about me, yeah?

21:39.341 --> 21:40.968
Almighty Lord?

21:41.051 --> 21:44.972
Almighty plus Lord, A.L. AL...

21:45.055 --> 21:46.014
Whoa.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.725
Heck, well, you know,
I kind of figured, uh...

21:49.852 --> 21:53.689
I kind of figured we were on the brink
of getting updates from the beyond.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.608
Whoo, these are old. Yeah.

21:56.692 --> 21:59.653
While you were figuring out
what you needed to figure out

21:59.736 --> 22:01.697
to get you to show up here, yeah?

22:01.780 --> 22:04.283
Well, that's interesting figuring, Herb.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.911
Well, can't say I blame you
for having your doubts.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.205
About the Almighty or my golf game?

22:10.289 --> 22:12.583
Well, I mean,
who could doubt the Almighty?

22:12.666 --> 22:16.170
Me, I could. I have. I do.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.964
And I'm not up for this ludicrous mission.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.843
Unless you have a robotics person
who can give me back

22:22.926 --> 22:25.304
the body and game I had when I was 30.

22:26.013 --> 22:29.850
Well, my part in this mission is, Joe,

22:29.933 --> 22:32.978
I get you to trust and believe.

22:33.061 --> 22:36.690
And your part is to turn all of that
self-doubt right there into faith.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.400
Now how 'bout...

22:38.483 --> 22:40.360
How 'bout you hit me a ball?

22:42.196 --> 22:43.363
What if I say no?

22:43.447 --> 22:46.283
You say no,
I give you money for gas

22:46.366 --> 22:49.494
and you go back to the incredible
excitement of your current life in...

22:49.578 --> 22:51.163
I'm sorry, I don't mean to laugh.

22:51.246 --> 22:52.915
...high finance!

22:55.334 --> 22:59.421
Trust in a higher purpose
than you figured was your highest purpose.

23:00.506 --> 23:02.257
Lots of things are possible, Joe.

23:04.343 --> 23:05.719
I'd love to cooperate,

23:06.845 --> 23:10.641
but when my daughter
lost her husband and child,

23:10.724 --> 23:13.268
and what she continues
to sacrifice her life for,

23:13.352 --> 23:16.563
a non-profit school for homeless kids.

23:16.647 --> 23:17.940
That's my...

23:19.358 --> 23:23.612
She and those kids. I mean...

23:25.864 --> 23:28.450
Well, then, heck, Joe!
I mean, cash in then!

23:28.534 --> 23:29.785
Cash it in!

23:30.536 --> 23:34.248
I don't know if you or Mighty AL know,

23:34.331 --> 23:39.169
but amateurs can't receive cash prizes.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.297
I'm thinking endorsements.

23:42.381 --> 23:44.550
Endorsements?

23:46.426 --> 23:49.054
Senile-guy swim diapers.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.226
Stair lifts with built-in bedpans.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.770
They don't have those, do they?

23:57.396 --> 23:59.731
Talking stool softeners.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.195
That is funny!

24:05.279 --> 24:06.405
I haven't seen those.

24:07.364 --> 24:10.659
Walk-in bathtub with...

24:11.243 --> 24:12.578
salad bar.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.538
And more! You know, sponge cake!

24:14.621 --> 24:15.914
Sponge cake.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.792
They've never had
a spokesperson.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.044
Sponge cake.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.464
Thirty-five years is too long.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.269
Ah!

24:39.563 --> 24:41.231
<i>Oh, it was just like that movie.</i>

24:41.815 --> 24:43.609
You know, <i>Close Encounters
of the Third Kind.</i>

24:43.692 --> 24:45.694
The light was on me.
And it wasn't for a long time,

24:45.777 --> 24:48.822
but it was on me and it was weird.

24:48.906 --> 24:52.451
I don't know. Some kind
of atmospheric anomaly. I don't know.

24:54.077 --> 24:57.122
Maybe what you thought
was an atmospheric anomaly

24:57.206 --> 24:59.374
was really a message from God.

25:04.379 --> 25:07.382
Or maybe it was an atmospheric anomaly.

25:07.466 --> 25:12.638
Joseph... no one, no one thing

25:12.721 --> 25:15.641
can force you back
to the faith you once had.

25:17.851 --> 25:21.021
I'm gonna change my concept
to what a day is.

25:21.104 --> 25:24.691
Hmm. I'm interested
in how you're gonna do that.

25:26.443 --> 25:29.446
Go to bed at 9:00, and wake up at 4:00.

25:29.530 --> 25:30.906
Theory being?

25:31.949 --> 25:35.536
A two-hour head start
on the rest of the world every day.

25:36.286 --> 25:39.873
Hmm. Maybe a way to hit 200 golf balls

25:39.957 --> 25:42.543
and run a bank and spend
enough time with your wife

25:42.626 --> 25:44.461
that she doesn't abandon you.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.631
Until further notice,

25:47.714 --> 25:50.843
I'll be coming in at 6:00
and leaving at 3:00.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.177
Thank you.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.809
Thanks for helping me
with this office.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.811
Hey, boss. Love the new hours.

26:00.894 --> 26:04.064
For me, not for you, Gabe.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.441
Knew it. Uh, oh, and great job
on those two reports.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.402
Looked them over. First time
I didn't make any mistakes.

26:08.485 --> 26:12.489
Oh, and also, I set up the exit interview
with the examiner for Friday at 11:00.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.700
Looking forward to that like a root canal.

26:14.783 --> 26:17.619
Oh, no, you should try a root canal.
You know what? My mom had one

26:17.703 --> 26:19.454
and she said that it was really
like a twilight sleep...

26:19.538 --> 26:20.914
- Gabe?
- Yep?

26:20.998 --> 26:24.793
If Audrey and I wanted
to start riding a bike,

26:24.877 --> 26:29.214
what would you suggest we do first

26:29.298 --> 26:32.301
after, say, buying the bike?

26:33.552 --> 26:34.553
Pedal?

26:37.514 --> 26:41.226
Now. Give these babies a try.

26:42.644 --> 26:47.149
Okay? Thing I taught Nicklaus
was, slow down at the top.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.484
Finish your backswing
before starting your downswing.

26:49.568 --> 26:51.153
It worked pretty good
for old Jackson, huh?

26:51.236 --> 26:52.654
You taught Jack Nicklaus.

26:52.738 --> 26:54.656
One lesson, all it took.

26:54.740 --> 26:56.909
Here, hit this.

26:56.992 --> 27:00.662
All the way back, all the way through.
Think ballet.

27:01.246 --> 27:04.875
Right? So that club you got right there,
I call it Joe's Slice Hotch,

27:04.958 --> 27:06.877
and this one right here
is your Hook Hotch.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.046
Now, Jojo, hit me a nice fade.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.217
Sponge cake!

27:14.176 --> 27:15.761
- Wow!
- Beautiful!

27:21.600 --> 27:23.936
- How 'bout a cold one?
- Absolutely!

27:24.561 --> 27:27.189
Hey, Sandy. How old are you?
Around 14?

27:27.272 --> 27:29.441
Pretty close.
Fourteen hundred, closer.

27:30.817 --> 27:34.404
Ooh, boy. My idea of a cold one's
are beer-related. What's this?

27:34.488 --> 27:38.450
- Ha! That's my special Herb's Herb Tea.
- Hmm.

27:38.534 --> 27:40.285
Huh? Say that ten times fast. But not now.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.663
Do it on your own time
'cause you've got golf balls to collect.

27:43.288 --> 27:46.625
Ah, you and your daddy boy
were real close, yeah?

27:47.668 --> 27:50.254
He was my hero.

27:51.213 --> 27:55.300
Hard worker, strong faith,
stronger values.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.470
Best golfer in town.

27:59.263 --> 28:03.225
When I graduated from high school,
I was offered a full-ride scholarship.

28:03.308 --> 28:07.312
College All-American.
Satellite tour. And then, uh...

28:08.021 --> 28:09.523
What? I don't recall.

28:10.148 --> 28:13.986
Oh, yeah. Then life kind of got in the way
of Kind-Love Joe's dreams, huh?

28:14.528 --> 28:17.114
Yeah. Isn't there something
in the Bible about

28:17.197 --> 28:18.907
God passing out new bodies?

28:18.991 --> 28:21.076
Yeah, Romans 8.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.080
But in Romans 5, it says,
"We rejoice in our suffering,

28:25.163 --> 28:27.291
because we know what suffering brings."
What is that?

28:27.374 --> 28:30.794
Massive resentment of God's inability

28:30.878 --> 28:33.172
to resist destroying innocent lives.

28:33.255 --> 28:36.008
I was gonna say perseverance,
but all right.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.259
I gotta go.

28:37.342 --> 28:40.053
Okay, well, go to your King James Bible
in your living room, Joe.

28:40.137 --> 28:43.056
If you have faith the size of a tiny
mustard seed, you can move mountains.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.725
I'm a mustard fan.

29:17.466 --> 29:20.594
You've heard the expression,
"Drive for show and putt for dough"?

29:21.637 --> 29:24.765
About 60,812 times.

29:24.848 --> 29:27.768
You're a good listener. I'm gonna show you
my foolproof method

29:27.851 --> 29:30.354
for making every putt inside of ten feet.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.897
Foolproof? Right.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.566
I don't know anything
that a human can't screw up.

29:34.650 --> 29:38.278
All right. I want you to grip the putter
firmly in your hands, Joe.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.531
Put the putter in the lifeline
of each hand.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.909
Good. Now. Put your elbows
against your side.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.828
No hand, arm or wrist movement.

29:46.912 --> 29:49.998
I want you to "visualate" the ball
going into the hole.

29:56.672 --> 30:01.677
Hmm.
So much for, uh, foolproof.

30:03.053 --> 30:04.471
- Bad "visualating."
- Okay.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.265
I want you to move the putter back, Joe,

30:06.348 --> 30:09.434
by rockin' the weight
off of your left instep

30:10.269 --> 30:12.271
and then back onto the left instep.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.691
So you're rockin' back,
rockin' back to your left foot.

30:15.774 --> 30:17.025
Okay? There's 50 balls here.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.444
Fifty?

30:19.528 --> 30:21.196
When you make all 50,
you can go home.

30:23.156 --> 30:27.327
And remember, faith is the belief
in the right to believe in yourself.

30:28.078 --> 30:30.956
I know, Joe.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.626
Baby Faith, huh?

30:36.879 --> 30:38.046
Putt.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.895
You got 49 more to go, Joe.
And you can go home.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.366
I was hungry at dinner time.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.911
Eat. I got this.

31:10.329 --> 31:12.039
So how was it?

31:13.707 --> 31:15.375
I sort of loved it.

31:15.459 --> 31:17.294
- Yeah.
- Really?

31:18.003 --> 31:19.505
You did?

31:22.216 --> 31:23.217
Tell me!

31:26.386 --> 31:29.598
It's fantastic. It felt really good.

31:31.016 --> 31:32.809
But we have a problem.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.021
Bank examiners
are coming in tomorrow.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.733
They're gonna want me to foreclose
on our daughter's school.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.032
And you're not properly prepared

31:47.115 --> 31:49.451
because you've been
tempted back to your faith

31:49.535 --> 31:51.286
that God will provide?

31:54.206 --> 31:58.126
Stuck on my faith that I have no clue
what God will provide,

31:59.211 --> 32:04.049
as the last offerings were
several people dead in our family.

32:08.971 --> 32:09.972
Well...

32:13.308 --> 32:16.645
Audrey's mortgage isn't gonna be an issue.

32:18.146 --> 32:20.858
- Tell me.
- Okay.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.277
Pay off Audrey's mortgage.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.447
With what? My stamp collection?

32:28.031 --> 32:32.661
Honey. All those...
those big payday speeches

32:32.744 --> 32:35.747
and autograph-signings
at those retirement homes

32:35.831 --> 32:40.169
after you win the Championship
of the World Entire.

32:40.252 --> 32:42.045
You really believe that?

32:42.129 --> 32:46.216
No. But I'm practicing pretending.

32:47.092 --> 32:50.429
- Here.
- Wait. Herb says that...

32:50.512 --> 32:52.514
Oh, Herb says.

32:54.183 --> 32:55.517
Oh. Come here.

32:58.020 --> 33:03.650
Now, let's just forget about
what Herb says for tonight, okay?

33:04.443 --> 33:05.861
Because we have the right.

33:06.612 --> 33:07.613
Hmm.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.033
We have the obligation.

33:16.079 --> 33:17.915
We have the desire.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.417
Your individual deposit accounts
are impressive.

33:20.501 --> 33:23.045
Your loan portfolio
to small local businesses,

33:23.128 --> 33:26.381
especially minorities
and first-time home buyers, admirable.

33:26.465 --> 33:28.509
Your collections
are persistent and effective,

33:28.592 --> 33:29.885
with the exception of one.

33:29.968 --> 33:34.097
Uh, a loan to
Jardin Del Sol Primary School

33:34.181 --> 33:36.266
that's four months in arrears.
Why haven't you foreclosed?

33:36.350 --> 33:38.310
That's a really important group in town.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.896
They feed and educate
poor and homeless children.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.564
Compassion is laudable,

33:42.648 --> 33:44.525
but it is not a hallmark
of the banking business.

33:44.608 --> 33:47.110
Sorry I'm late. Couldn't find
the right thing to wear.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.904
Joe, Gabe, Mrs. Perkins,

33:48.987 --> 33:52.241
I am the incoming president
of Mr. Amable-Amo's board.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.660
My name is Herbert Barreth,
PhD Philosophy,

33:54.743 --> 33:56.537
Physical Education, Arborist... Whoa!

33:56.620 --> 33:58.664
I love that little Buddhist thingy.

33:58.747 --> 34:00.457
One of my favorite thinkers,
Gautama Buddha.

34:00.541 --> 34:02.042
What's that other one? Don't tell me.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.044
- I won't tell you, Mr. Barreth.
- Uh, Dr. Barreth.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.796
Doctor. Because I have no idea...

34:05.879 --> 34:07.381
You have no idea what's going on.

34:07.464 --> 34:12.219
But whatever's going on can be fixed up
inside "eleventeen" days.

34:12.302 --> 34:14.388
Eleventeen? I'm sorry, I don't...

34:14.471 --> 34:16.723
That is a banking term
of where I hail from.

34:16.806 --> 34:19.016
- And where's that, Mister...
- Uh, Doctor.

34:19.101 --> 34:23.105
That is over yonder,
the last star that you see before dawn.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.400
She wants $300,000 in arrears.

34:26.483 --> 34:29.820
Okay, Mr. Amable-Amo will be going
on two fundraising trips,

34:29.902 --> 34:32.406
and when he returns
from the second trip in May,

34:32.489 --> 34:34.408
back payments, in full.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.702
It's only April 25th.
I'm afraid I can't poss...

34:36.784 --> 34:38.161
Don't be afraid that you can't.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.664
You remember what the Buddha said?
And if you don't, I'll remind you.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.042
"Death is not to be feared
by someone who has lived wisely."

34:44.126 --> 34:48.088
Wow! So, be brave, Mrs. Perkins,
and trust that you can do the right thing,

34:48.172 --> 34:51.300
even though it appears
increasingly unpopular.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.183
It's your funeral, fellas.

35:00.058 --> 35:03.478
Funerals don't exactly terrify me anymore,
Mrs. Perkins.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.981
For the record, you haven't heard
the last of this.

35:06.064 --> 35:09.484
Where I come from,
we never hear the last of anything.

35:09.568 --> 35:10.944
I think she's mad.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.323
- Yeah, okay, that was, uh...
- It was, wasn't it?

35:14.406 --> 35:15.490
Uh-huh, I have a question.

35:15.574 --> 35:16.950
I'm sure you do. Ask the boss.
I gotta go.

35:17.034 --> 35:18.577
Two trips in May?

35:18.660 --> 35:20.078
Yes. Think about it.

35:21.622 --> 35:25.375
The World Entire
Open Sectional Qualifier.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.961
I gotta finish in the top two in the...

35:28.587 --> 35:30.047
Oh, my God!

35:30.130 --> 35:32.257
Yes, exactly. Oh-your-God.

35:32.341 --> 35:34.176
Nothing to fear, Joe.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.761
Except fear itself, right?

35:35.844 --> 35:40.015
No. There is nothing to fear
except the burdens of success.

35:40.098 --> 35:41.099
Right, Gabe?

35:41.183 --> 35:43.852
I'm behind whatever you say.
Just get me the bumper stickers.

35:43.936 --> 35:45.812
Uh, don't suck up.
It's not appealing on you.

35:45.896 --> 35:46.939
Okay, sir.

35:47.022 --> 35:48.941
Tomorrow morning, Joe,
I want you to meet me

35:49.024 --> 35:51.026
at the Artesia Country Club
bright and early.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.402
- 8:00 a.m.
- Why?

35:52.486 --> 35:54.404
Don't ask why.

35:54.488 --> 35:55.989
Oh, and wear something nice.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.680
Supposed to clear up in two hours,
47 minutes and 63 seconds.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.017
Aha! Mrs. Amable-Amo!

36:24.101 --> 36:25.477
I know you.

36:25.561 --> 36:27.813
Does anybody really know anyone,
Mrs. Amable-Amo?

36:27.896 --> 36:30.607
Something told me
to come along today.

36:30.691 --> 36:33.360
I only sent you that message
once telepathically.

36:33.443 --> 36:36.029
When I was picking up
the wire mesh yesterday.

36:36.113 --> 36:37.990
Very good, Mrs. Amable-Amo.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.575
Are you allowed to call me Sheila?

36:39.658 --> 36:42.536
Only you can stop me, Sheila.
Come on, Joe.

36:42.619 --> 36:46.039
Some golfers
have personal trainers, huh?

36:46.123 --> 36:48.876
They don't use horse liniment anymore
like when you played last.

36:48.959 --> 36:50.961
- Sheila! Joe!
- Hi.

36:51.044 --> 36:53.046
Coming in to finish the sign up, Dave.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.798
You haven't played in years.

36:54.882 --> 36:56.425
Thirty-five to be exact.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.552
You don't have a handicap.

36:58.635 --> 37:02.222
Exactly, Dave. That's why he needs
to play in the club championship,

37:02.306 --> 37:06.810
so he can establish a handicap low enough
to enter a World Entire Qualifier.

37:06.894 --> 37:08.395
A World Entire Qualifier.

37:08.478 --> 37:09.730
She just said that.

37:09.813 --> 37:11.899
- And you are?
- I'm Herb.

37:12.441 --> 37:14.985
Director of Personal Hygiene and Hijinks.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.112
- I had to make you the lowest seed.
- Mm-hmm.

37:17.196 --> 37:19.531
Which means you play
our defending champion,

37:19.615 --> 37:21.533
Marco Figueroa, in the first round.

37:21.617 --> 37:24.203
Perfect. He gets clobbered
in the first match,

37:24.286 --> 37:28.123
it frees up his whole weekend for that
fence I've been nagging him to put up.

37:28.832 --> 37:32.127
Get the hammer out.
Marco hasn't lost a match in five years.

37:32.211 --> 37:33.170
Neither has Joe.

37:38.425 --> 37:41.637
One of my dearest Chinese friends
a few thousand years ago said,

37:41.720 --> 37:43.597
"The longest journey
starts with a single step."

37:43.680 --> 37:45.098
- You're ready.
- Oh, I doubt it.

37:45.182 --> 37:47.476
- Joe.
- Oh, yes, I'm ready. I'm ready.

37:47.559 --> 37:49.895
- Any sage advice?
- Most importantly, I think, uh...

37:49.978 --> 37:52.648
I know. Trust in AL.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.358
Oh, AL would appreciate that,

37:54.441 --> 37:56.318
but I was thinking
of something more spiritual,

37:56.401 --> 37:57.986
like forget about the mechanics.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.113
Who's AL?
Is Al that guy at the deli?

38:00.197 --> 38:01.949
AL, the Almighty Lord
does love pastrami.

38:02.032 --> 38:06.620
<i>...Marco Figueroa,
Joe Amable-Amo, you have the tee.</i>

38:15.629 --> 38:17.965
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello!

38:18.048 --> 38:19.550
I see you brought a caddy.

38:19.633 --> 38:22.719
No thoughts for the day, okay?
It's all up inside you.

38:31.395 --> 38:32.771
Herbert?

38:32.855 --> 38:34.314
- Bruce Lee.
- Yes!

38:55.085 --> 38:56.753
Amable-Amo, 1-up.

38:57.838 --> 38:59.673
Foolproof.

39:00.716 --> 39:02.217
Foolproof.

39:09.933 --> 39:11.310
{\an8}Yes!

39:12.895 --> 39:14.104
I couldn't do this without you.

39:15.731 --> 39:18.066
Amable-Amo, 2-up.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.277
Good shot, Marco!

39:20.360 --> 39:21.278
Breathe.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.197
Yeah, take a deep breath.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.781
Don't slow play me, Jose!

39:28.619 --> 39:30.954
Jesus, Moses and Mary!

39:32.539 --> 39:34.333
Love that group.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.627
<i>♪ Figueroa going down ♪</i>

39:36.710 --> 39:38.962
<i>♪ Down, down, down... ♪</i>

39:39.046 --> 39:40.214
I can never hit that note.

39:40.297 --> 39:41.131
<i>♪ Down ♪</i>

39:41.215 --> 39:42.174
One more time!

39:50.599 --> 39:52.309
You can let him win.

39:52.392 --> 39:55.437
Hey. Not a chance.

39:56.522 --> 39:57.606
Foolproof.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.024
Foolproof.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.907
Amable-Amo, 2-up,
one hole to go.

40:06.990 --> 40:09.576
That's the match!

40:10.327 --> 40:11.537
Oh!

40:12.579 --> 40:14.581
Wow!

40:14.665 --> 40:16.458
- Good game, Joe. Heck of a round.
- Thank you.

40:16.542 --> 40:17.668
- Terrific.
- Thank you.

40:17.751 --> 40:19.086
More matches, honey.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.008
Foolproof.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.178
Sponge cake.

40:28.262 --> 40:29.763
Come on. My bad.

40:33.183 --> 40:34.476
Whoo! Daddy!

40:37.437 --> 40:40.065
The Club Champion, Joe Amable-Amo!

40:41.483 --> 40:43.819
Thank you so much! Great game.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.030
Whoo!

40:49.992 --> 40:53.537
Thank you!
Thank you so much! Thank you.

40:54.997 --> 40:57.875
I haven't seen you play golf
like that before.

40:57.958 --> 41:02.379
Who would've thought? No.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.340
- I've never played golf like that before.
- Really?

41:05.424 --> 41:08.260
Not even when I was a kid, no.
Ever. Are you kidding?

41:09.428 --> 41:11.847
I'm so proud of you!

41:14.433 --> 41:17.519
I mean, I had my doubts.
Dove or no dove, but...

41:18.687 --> 41:19.938
I don't know, it's just...

41:20.022 --> 41:26.361
You're just becoming this new and improved
version of your younger self.

41:26.445 --> 41:31.783
I didn't think there was
that much room for improvement.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.579
Still don't think
God spoke to you, huh?

41:35.662 --> 41:40.834
Hmm. How can you seriously
weigh playing good golf

41:40.918 --> 41:44.004
against a family tragedy,
honey? That's all.

41:45.797 --> 41:46.882
I don't know.

41:47.841 --> 41:52.262
Maybe it's not about golf, or you.

41:53.722 --> 41:58.060
Maybe... maybe it's God
challenging people

41:58.143 --> 42:01.813
all over the world
who have become complacent to...

42:03.106 --> 42:06.777
to be more, to do more
than they ever thought possible.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.863
And not take refuge
in their personal pain.

42:15.244 --> 42:16.328
I love you.

42:19.289 --> 42:20.666
I really love you.

42:37.558 --> 42:38.767
Joe!

42:40.102 --> 42:41.103
Oh!

42:44.147 --> 42:45.190
Joe!

42:46.608 --> 42:49.820
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah?

42:49.903 --> 42:52.239
- What?
- Look at the garden.

42:52.322 --> 42:53.824
I'm sorry, baby.

42:54.741 --> 42:56.535
Really, I'm sorry.

42:56.618 --> 42:58.036
I'm so sorry.

42:58.662 --> 43:00.998
Get! Get! Get out!

43:03.542 --> 43:04.918
Get!

43:37.659 --> 43:38.493
Hello!

43:38.577 --> 43:40.829
- Hey, Mr. A! Um...
- Hey, Gabe.

43:40.913 --> 43:42.998
Give me ten minutes, all right?
If you can.

43:43.081 --> 43:44.708
You got it! You got it!

43:45.792 --> 43:47.503
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

43:47.586 --> 43:48.962
I didn't want to bother you, sir.

43:49.046 --> 43:51.673
I got a call from Herb
that you needed help?

43:52.508 --> 43:55.135
Uh, can you give me a hand?

43:55.219 --> 43:57.554
Yeah! May I? Okay.

43:59.765 --> 44:01.266
Is it doing it? Oh, it is!

44:12.653 --> 44:15.531
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

44:15.614 --> 44:17.199
Look at that!

44:17.282 --> 44:19.326
I'm just sorry it took so long.

44:19.409 --> 44:20.786
Oh! Oh! Oh!

44:23.956 --> 44:24.957
Two...

44:25.040 --> 44:26.333
- ...three.
- My tongue was out.

44:26.416 --> 44:28.210
I just said, "But that's not a monkey."

44:28.293 --> 44:32.923
So that was...
That was what happened to... to me.

44:33.841 --> 44:36.927
- Oh. You good, Daddy?
- Never better.

44:37.010 --> 44:39.346
Except maybe that Tuesday in November

44:39.429 --> 44:42.391
when we adopted our Bean Dip
35 years ago.

44:42.474 --> 44:43.892
My favorite day.

44:43.976 --> 44:45.269
My favorite day.

44:45.352 --> 44:47.604
My favorite day. Period.

44:47.688 --> 44:49.481
- Bean Dip.
- Definitely my favorite.

44:49.565 --> 44:50.899
You guys, I just can't stand to think

44:50.983 --> 44:53.443
that you're gonna start selling off
your retirement to help me.

44:53.527 --> 44:56.530
And I can't guarantee you, Daddy,
that I'm not gonna be in the same exact...

44:56.613 --> 44:58.615
What? What?

44:59.783 --> 45:00.868
Please just tell me.

45:01.743 --> 45:03.036
Don't worry about it.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.329
Because?

45:04.413 --> 45:06.582
Because your dad's gonna win
the Championship

45:06.665 --> 45:08.959
of the World Entire Golf Tournament.

45:09.042 --> 45:10.419
What? Daddy?

45:10.502 --> 45:13.797
Yep. And, um...

45:14.798 --> 45:17.426
I can't accept the prize money,

45:17.509 --> 45:19.678
but I can rent myself for endorsements.

45:19.761 --> 45:22.347
For Jardin Del Sol.

45:23.974 --> 45:27.019
This is the crazy tournament
the crazy oil billionaire is funding.

45:27.102 --> 45:28.979
It's the biggest prize money
in history, Daddy.

45:29.062 --> 45:31.148
All of the young guys are gonna be there.

45:31.231 --> 45:32.357
Have some faith.

45:32.441 --> 45:35.944
Yeah. He's gonna qualify
in Denver next week.

45:36.028 --> 45:38.864
And then he wins in Palm Springs
two weeks later.

49:48.906 --> 49:51.241
Win the World Entire?

49:56.788 --> 49:58.957
Are you out of your mind?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.794
Oh, God! Help!

50:06.173 --> 50:07.674
This fall's not gonna kill you.

50:07.758 --> 50:10.385
Probably make you an invalid,
which wouldn't be nice for Sheila,

50:10.469 --> 50:14.264
but if you still wanna die,
let's do it right now. I'll let go.

50:17.643 --> 50:18.810
No!

50:23.398 --> 50:25.859
Go back to your faith, Joe.

50:26.902 --> 50:29.154
Go back for you.

50:29.238 --> 50:30.822
You don't wanna die.

50:56.807 --> 50:57.808
Honey!

51:00.269 --> 51:01.895
You have to get up.

51:02.938 --> 51:07.317
You have to get up.
You have to get up.

51:07.401 --> 51:08.777
Come on with me.

51:08.861 --> 51:12.281
Honey, let's just get
a coffee first. Okay?

51:12.364 --> 51:13.365
Come on.

51:16.827 --> 51:18.203
Oh, my gosh!

51:18.287 --> 51:19.997
Oh, my God! Look at that!

51:20.664 --> 51:21.707
This is beautiful.

51:25.627 --> 51:27.713
Honey! How did this...

51:34.178 --> 51:37.264
Well, isn't that just such a clever way

51:37.347 --> 51:40.601
to keep You-Know-Who
in our good graces?

51:45.439 --> 51:48.942
{\an8}Well, here's one of golf's
most unusual stories.

51:49.026 --> 51:52.321
{\an8}In Denver today,
65-year-old Joe Amable-Amo

51:52.404 --> 51:56.408
won the southwest qualifier
for the Championship of the World Entire.

51:56.491 --> 52:00.245
{\an8}From New Mexico,
the bank president beat 40 guys

52:00.329 --> 52:03.290
{\an8}nowhere near his age like a bass drum.

52:03.373 --> 52:06.293
{\an8}Asked afterward how he did it,
Amable-Amo said,

52:06.376 --> 52:08.003
{\an8}"I'm a garden, blooming."

52:08.712 --> 52:10.756
{\an8}Really. Bloom away, old guy.

52:10.839 --> 52:15.636
{\an8}Amable-Amo will now play in golf's richest
and most prestigious tournament.

52:15.719 --> 52:19.306
{\an8}Every major on the planet
will be gunning for the inaugural title

52:19.389 --> 52:22.226
{\an8}and its staggering $3 million prize.

52:22.309 --> 52:27.272
The World Entire is shaping up to be
the biggest golf tournament in history.

52:27.356 --> 52:30.150
{\an8}Any golfer who's anybody
will be playing in it.

52:30.234 --> 52:32.611
{\an8}And apparently, one golfer who's nobody.

53:20.742 --> 53:23.078
Wow!

54:03.952 --> 54:08.248
Mrs. Perkins from the bank
would like "a word," as she put it.

54:09.499 --> 54:12.419
One word? Sardines? Plankton?

54:12.503 --> 54:13.629
Mrs. Perkins.

54:13.712 --> 54:16.423
Mr. Amable-Amo. Deadline approaching.

54:17.174 --> 54:19.134
That's five words, Mrs. Perkins.

54:19.218 --> 54:20.260
<i>Very amusing.</i>

54:20.344 --> 54:21.470
A friendly reminder.

54:21.553 --> 54:23.514
<i>And what form
does this "friendliness" take?</i>

54:23.597 --> 54:25.224
<i>If I were you...</i>

54:25.307 --> 54:26.850
I think we both agree you're not.

54:27.809 --> 54:29.102
I said "if."

54:29.186 --> 54:32.481
As me, Mrs. Plankton, you'd do what?

54:32.564 --> 54:35.150
I would get the foreclosure paperwork
ready for you to serve.

54:35.817 --> 54:40.113
Okay. Friendly reminder
taken as friendly. Thank you.

54:40.197 --> 54:44.201
And can you send the sardines on ice?

54:49.581 --> 54:51.959
- Something has happened.
- What?

54:52.042 --> 54:53.585
I don't know.

54:53.669 --> 54:55.504
But you are funny again.

54:55.587 --> 55:00.217
Just a temporary loss
of my inconsolable fury at the world.

55:00.300 --> 55:01.802
Hmm.

55:08.058 --> 55:09.184
Sheila!

55:09.935 --> 55:10.978
Yes?

55:11.728 --> 55:12.855
You don't need that?

55:13.981 --> 55:15.482
What are you doing? Hmm.

55:16.483 --> 55:17.776
Are we breaking up?

55:17.860 --> 55:20.112
Take your time and love for me.

55:27.452 --> 55:29.496
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Sheila. Hi!

55:29.580 --> 55:32.958
There's the baby. Hi, how are you?

55:33.041 --> 55:34.668
- Hey!
- Hey, Joe!

55:34.751 --> 55:41.258
Okay, so, what I'm saying is,
win or lose, I'm here for you. Okay?

55:41.341 --> 55:45.345
But I think God chose the right two guys
for the mission.

55:45.429 --> 55:47.264
- Wow!
- I love you.

55:47.347 --> 55:48.557
I love you.

55:49.892 --> 55:50.976
It means a lot to me.

55:51.059 --> 55:52.936
Yeah, to me too, Sheila. Thanks.

55:53.020 --> 55:57.399
"So you shall go on your way,
and you shall not hurt your foot."

55:57.482 --> 56:00.485
Hey! Proverbs 3:23-3:24.

56:00.569 --> 56:01.653
Very good.

56:23.550 --> 56:25.511
Couldn't spring for a place
a little nicer, Joe?

56:25.594 --> 56:28.347
Put me on a nicer per diem,
we'll move up.

56:29.056 --> 56:30.641
My funds are spoken for.

56:31.725 --> 56:33.143
Of course!

56:37.731 --> 56:39.149
You sure showed those rabbits!

56:39.233 --> 56:41.318
Yeah, that's right.

56:43.946 --> 56:46.657
I guess things do work out
sometimes, sweetheart.

56:47.491 --> 56:48.617
You know, like for you.

56:49.868 --> 56:52.579
If you have hope and you have faith,

56:53.914 --> 56:56.041
and you're working to change reality.

56:57.209 --> 57:01.296
And to my shock and delight,

57:01.380 --> 57:05.008
a guy who's helping me
to help myself to be new again.

57:05.092 --> 57:08.428
Oh, I share in that delight, darling!

57:09.513 --> 57:11.515
- You're my mommy.
- Yes, I am.

57:17.229 --> 57:18.897
Let's hit it to Palm Springs.

57:19.648 --> 57:21.441
- Right now?
- Yeah.

57:21.525 --> 57:24.945
We're gonna rent a bus,
go pick up the parents

57:25.028 --> 57:28.574
and all your kids and bring Dad
a busload of hope!

57:30.617 --> 57:31.785
- Yes?
- Yeah, cool.

57:31.869 --> 57:32.995
Okay.

57:34.788 --> 57:37.291
{\an8}<i>This is the game's next evolution.</i>

57:38.375 --> 57:40.919
{\an8}<i>The richest prize in golf history.</i>

57:43.338 --> 57:47.718
{\an8}<i>This is their time, their world
and their championship to win.</i>

57:48.677 --> 57:51.555
{\an8}<i>A new era, a new tournament,</i>

57:51.638 --> 57:53.557
{\an8}<i>a new story will be written.</i>

57:57.728 --> 58:00.731
<i>The Championship of the World Entire.</i>

58:02.566 --> 58:05.986
{\an8}The richest golf tournament.
in the history of mankind, folks.

58:06.069 --> 58:08.238
{\an8}Yeah, just about every country
and continent

58:08.322 --> 58:09.740
{\an8}are represented in this one.

58:09.823 --> 58:12.367
{\an8}The favorite, of course,
is Scotland's Archie Borthwick

58:12.451 --> 58:14.286
{\an8}<i>who has won pretty much every tournament.</i>

58:14.369 --> 58:15.704
{\an8}<i>Except the biggie.</i>

58:15.787 --> 58:17.039
{\an8}<i>Like the World Entire.</i>

58:17.122 --> 58:19.249
{\an8}Correct. Now Borthwick
will be playing with the man

58:19.333 --> 58:21.502
{\an8}least likely to win the golf tournament.

58:21.585 --> 58:23.045
{\an8}Jose Amable-Amo...

58:23.128 --> 58:24.296
{\an8}It's Joe.

58:24.379 --> 58:25.547
{\an8}Hey, I don't know who he is.

58:25.631 --> 58:27.132
{\an8}- Joe Amable-Amo.
- Right.

58:27.216 --> 58:31.136
{\an8}The 65-year-old banker from New Mexico
who somehow qualified his way in.

58:31.220 --> 58:34.473
{\an8}Now, Amable-Amo is just thrilled
to be here, I'm sure.

58:34.556 --> 58:36.808
{\an8}Amable-Amo winning this thing
would be like me

58:36.892 --> 58:39.686
{\an8}winning the Nobel Prize
for color commentary.

58:39.770 --> 58:42.356
{\an8}- In other words, no chance.
- Yep.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.441
Good morning, boys.

58:44.525 --> 58:45.943
- Good morning, gents!
- Good morning.

58:46.026 --> 58:48.820
- Pro-V.
- All right, we got a Titleist. Yeah.

58:51.114 --> 58:52.533
Okay. Good luck.

58:54.368 --> 58:58.705
From Scotland, three-time
Masters runner-up,

58:58.789 --> 59:00.749
Archie Borthwick.

59:09.675 --> 59:12.719
<i>Archie Borthwick
now getting set on the tee.</i>

59:12.803 --> 59:16.139
<i>Borthwick of course, with his
longtime caddy, Wiley Andrews</i>

59:16.223 --> 59:17.850
<i>and his wife, Camille.</i>

59:17.933 --> 59:21.270
<i>Camille is an interesting story
unto herself.</i>

59:21.353 --> 59:23.814
<i>A former Miss America contestant
from Illinois,</i>

59:23.897 --> 59:27.359
<i>she was the first-ever deaf contestant
in the Miss America contest</i>

59:27.442 --> 59:29.695
<i>and she finished third.</i>

59:29.778 --> 59:31.947
<i>Camille is right there
at her husband's side,</i>

59:32.030 --> 59:34.658
<i>and she hopes for great results
in this tournament too.</i>

59:35.367 --> 59:39.329
<i>Wife and caddy. Cheering hard
for Archie to win this thing.</i>

59:39.413 --> 59:42.249
- Quiet, please.
- Okay, stay focused.

59:44.168 --> 59:45.586
Get in the hole!

59:49.464 --> 59:52.050
You're on the tee
at The World Golf Entire, Joe.

59:52.134 --> 59:55.220
- An actor playing the...
- World's greatest golfer. I got it.

59:55.304 --> 59:56.722
Not much at stake though, really.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.390
I mean, God's message,

59:58.473 --> 01:00:00.642
the bank's future,
your daughter's non-profit.

01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:05.105
Oh, and this little thing called
your reputation for eternity.

01:00:05.189 --> 01:00:08.192
But only that long, right? Eternity.

01:00:09.151 --> 01:00:12.988
Please welcome,
from Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA,

01:00:13.071 --> 01:00:15.532
Joe Amable-Amo.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:19.995
- You got this, Joe!
- Come on, Joe!

01:00:36.887 --> 01:00:39.389
- Foolproof.
- Foolproof.

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:03.247
Good putt.

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:04.581
Mr. Amable-Amo.

01:01:05.374 --> 01:01:07.626
Read about you.
You've got quite the story there, sir.

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.127
Thank you.

01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.212
Nice going, dudler.

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:13.423
Good first hole.

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:01.930
<i>Go, Joe! Go, Joe!</i>

01:02:02.014 --> 01:02:03.432
Joe! Joe! Joe!

01:02:16.403 --> 01:02:17.696
Whoa!

01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:50.395
<i>Joe Amable-Amo, folks.</i>

01:02:50.479 --> 01:02:53.774
<i>Tied for fourth after an opening round 67</i>

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.442
<i>and a day two 68.</i>

01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:58.946
{\an8}Two rounds to go. Impossible, right?

01:02:59.029 --> 01:03:00.405
{\an8}Yeah, I don't believe it.

01:03:00.489 --> 01:03:02.407
{\an8}Playing with the likes
of Archie Borthwick,

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:04.743
{\an8}for whom greatness
has long been predicted,

01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:07.704
{\an8}but which so far has eluded
this very gifted,

01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:09.623
{\an8}angry young Scotsman.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:10.916
{\an8}Can you relate?

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:14.044
{\an8}No, I'm an old, angry Irishman.

01:03:14.127 --> 01:03:15.546
{\an8}Angry part's there.

01:03:15.629 --> 01:03:17.673
{\an8}Borthwick, however,
looking awfully strong

01:03:17.756 --> 01:03:21.885
{\an8}after a day two 66
currently in third place.

01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:33.814
You all right over there?

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:34.898
Phew.

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:38.861
This experience, this journey, you...

01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:43.073
it makes you think about, you know what?

01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:47.995
Yea, probably, but tell me anyway.

01:03:49.746 --> 01:03:52.374
Most religions since time immemorial

01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:58.297
have had something like what
the Judeo-Christians call The Golden Rule.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.384
Billions of people have been taught
to do for others

01:04:02.467 --> 01:04:06.388
without expectation of reciprocity.

01:04:09.224 --> 01:04:11.310
You'd think with a message
that simple and elegant,

01:04:11.393 --> 01:04:13.437
that you people would get along better.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.605
Good night, Joe.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.691
Good night, Herb.

01:04:32.831 --> 01:04:35.250
- It's a glorious day, Joe.
- Yep.

01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:38.086
Hey, keep it going, pro! Pulling for ya!

01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:41.215
Why don't you caddy for him
the rest of the season, eh, Wiley?

01:04:42.633 --> 01:04:44.343
See what you started?

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:47.179
You must be tired of me
chokin' major after major.

01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:49.765
What do you say?

01:04:50.557 --> 01:04:55.687
{\an8}The unlikely Joe Amable-Amo
at the age of 65

01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:58.857
{\an8}goes birdie, birdie on ten and eleven!

01:04:58.941 --> 01:05:01.276
{\an8}He's right there in the hunt.
I mean, what are the odds?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.987
<i>No odds. Not even
on the board, Dave. It can't be.</i>

01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:08.951
Uh, before you hit your next shot,

01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:13.038
you might wanna take a look
over yonder at that gallery.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:17.084
Coming through.
Thank you, thank you!

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.168
Mm-hmm.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:20.671
He's right there. Hi!

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:24.216
Oh!

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:25.467
Who's that with 'em?

01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:26.927
- The bikers?
- Yeah.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.679
Hey, president and founder.

01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:32.266
You're telling me
they're called the Apostles?

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:33.642
Hello!

01:05:34.852 --> 01:05:36.144
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

01:05:37.062 --> 01:05:39.398
Hello, everybody! Hello!

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.483
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:44.653
<i>And with a birdie on 18,</i>

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:47.739
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo,
alone in second place.

01:05:47.823 --> 01:05:51.285
{\an8}We all obviously
got this guy all wrong, David.

01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:54.246
{\an8}Yeah, I mean, he's behind
the tournament leader, Archie Borthwick

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:57.332
{\an8}by just one shot and they are going to be
paired together tomorrow.

01:05:57.416 --> 01:06:00.544
{\an8}Can you imagine the final round
we've got ahead of us tomorrow?

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:04.548
{\an8}Borthwick, Amable-Amo...
history or consigned to oblivion?

01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:06.008
{\an8}- Stay tuned.

01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:08.635
<i>♪ Someday you'll turn around ♪</i>

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:12.639
<i>♪ And realize you're mine ♪</i>

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:15.225
<i>♪ And I believe ♪</i>

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:18.437
<i>♪ It just might be tonight ♪</i>

01:06:20.189 --> 01:06:23.692
I'm gonna give my fingers a rest.
I'll be back in five.

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:31.700
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:35.495
Playing together again, huh?
Final twosome? Final round?

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:38.957
And the Borthwicks. What happened?
What did they do?

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:40.709
Hit a fancy bistro all alone?

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:45.130
Archibald's not big on human communion.

01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:48.133
Camille and I try to work it out with him.

01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:51.220
But, you know, what are you gonna do?
He's just, you know.

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:54.640
He likes you guys though.
You know that, don't you?

01:06:54.723 --> 01:06:56.850
- Hey.
- He's just a little, well...

01:06:56.934 --> 01:07:00.103
The feelings of expectation
of him are huge,

01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:06.068
and his feelings of obligation
to fulfill those expectations even huger.

01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:09.321
You read his psychiatric report.

01:07:09.404 --> 01:07:11.615
No, I felt that I've been there.

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:14.326
"No temptation has overtaken you
that is uncommon to man.

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:16.703
God is faithful. He will never
allow you to be tested

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:18.288
beyond your ability."

01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:20.874
- That goes for you too.
- Thank you.

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:22.125
I needed that.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:24.169
Archie, John Quiñones.

01:07:24.253 --> 01:07:26.296
How does it feel like
playing in the final pairing

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.340
in the world's richest golf tournament?

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:31.009
Playing against a man
who's twice your age?

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.887
It's a joke.

01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:36.306
A joke? What's the funny part?

01:07:39.685 --> 01:07:42.229
- Sorry, John. Big fan.
- Thank you.

01:07:42.312 --> 01:07:46.316
Joe Amable-Amo. Your opponent
considers your participation

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.778
in this high moment of drama a joke.

01:07:49.862 --> 01:07:51.446
What do you think of that?

01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:57.035
Well, Herb and I have been laughing
for the last three days.

01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:01.456
So, I think he's right.

01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:06.128
I hope you and Chong
get back together.

01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:10.549
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo,
all alone in second place.

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:14.469
{\an8}And the tournament leader,
Archibald Borthwick, ready to go here.

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:18.182
<i>Borthwick has a one-shot lead
on the amiable Amable-Amo</i>

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:19.600
<i>with 18 holes to play.</i>

01:08:19.683 --> 01:08:21.602
<i>This should be very interesting.</i>

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:23.270
- <i>I'm hoping for history.</i>
- Careful, boys.

01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:25.022
I'm sporting a lucky hat.

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.024
Have a good round.

01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:29.443
He's lucky he got it on his head.

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:33.113
Please welcome,
from Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA,

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:34.698
Joe Amable-Amo.

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:46.877
Nothing to fear but success, Joe.

01:08:53.884 --> 01:08:56.220
<i>Beautiful drive by Amable-Amo.</i>

01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.430
<i>Not gonna beat you with a power game,</i>

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:00.015
<i>but just splits the fairway.</i>

01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:02.518
Now that's a drive, yeah.

01:09:09.524 --> 01:09:12.653
And from Scotland, Archie Borthwick.

01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.029
Baba Booey!

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:15.948
<i>Archie Borthwick on the tee.</i>

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:20.786
<i>And he has been outdriving Amable-Amo
by about 50 or 60 yards.</i>

01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:22.996
<i>And I would expect
to see the same right here.</i>

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.292
<i>Borthwick with a beauty!</i>

01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:33.465
He wants to slide a little,
but what have I taught you?

01:09:34.383 --> 01:09:35.384
Foolproof!

01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:36.468
Knock it in, bro.

01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:41.598
<i>Amable-Amo from about 12 feet.</i>

01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:44.309
<i>He needs this to stay one shot
behind Borthwick,</i>

01:09:44.393 --> 01:09:47.187
<i>and he has been fantastic
with the putter all tournament long.</i>

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.189
<i>And, Terry, that's usually
the first thing to go</i>

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:51.233
<i>when you get to about 40 years of age.</i>

01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:52.734
<i>Speak for yourself.</i>

01:09:53.484 --> 01:09:55.654
<i>Looks like he's got the line!</i>

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:05.163
<i>Oh, wow!
He just keeps making us wrong.</i>

01:10:05.247 --> 01:10:07.833
<i>Amable-Amo with just a beautiful par,</i>

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:11.128
<i>keeping pace just one shot off the lead.</i>

01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:13.338
<i>One shot behind Archie Borthwick.
Amazing.</i>

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.257
That was good!

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.384
<i>This guy,
he's like a fart in a space suit.</i>

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:19.303
{\an8}He just will not go away.

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.138
{\an8}Uh, okay.

01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:23.473
Hey, uh, Arch. Favorite movie line.

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:26.393
Few movies, lot of golf.

01:10:26.476 --> 01:10:28.604
"Go ahead, make my day."
<i>Dirty Harry.</i>

01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:32.482
Yeah, mine is, uh... I watched it...
With the shark.

01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:34.443
It's, uh... <i>Teeth?</i>

01:10:34.526 --> 01:10:37.154
<i>Teeth?</i> No, it's Jaws, bro.

01:10:37.863 --> 01:10:39.865
- "I'm gonna need a bigger..."
- "...bigger boat."

01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:42.910
Yeah.

01:10:47.206 --> 01:10:50.918
We've got 225 to the pin,
220 to the center,

01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:55.172
so I want you to carry the front,
let it release back to the pin.

01:10:55.255 --> 01:10:56.840
Uh, Slice Hotch.

01:10:57.466 --> 01:11:00.802
Trust your swing
and let the monkey loose, <i>mijo.</i>

01:11:02.054 --> 01:11:05.349
<i>Amable-Amo now here
on the tee at the fourth.</i>

01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:09.394
<i>How about this hole? 240 yard par 3.</i>

01:11:09.478 --> 01:11:11.021
<i>He thinks he can get there</i>

01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:13.315
<i>with this really strange-looking
extra-long club</i>

01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:15.734
<i>that looks like an elephant's toenail
on a stick.</i>

01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:18.153
- <i>And he hits it.</i>
- Whoo!

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:20.948
<i>Oh, he hits it to perfection!</i>

01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:23.700
<i>Wow, look at this.
To about three feet.</i>

01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:26.286
<i>A beautiful shot by Amable-Amo.</i>

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:27.871
Absolutely heavenly!

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:31.250
Wiley! Don't. Don't. Get out!

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:40.259
<i>Borthwick with a very good look
at birdie here to maintain the lead.</i>

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.638
<i>Oh, a tough miss.</i>

01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:48.934
<i>So that par now gonna put
Borthwick and Amable-Amo</i>

01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:51.395
<i>into a share of first place, David.</i>

01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:55.107
<i>You know, Terry,
Borthwick, he just looks bewildered now</i>

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:56.900
<i>that this old goat won't go away.</i>

01:11:56.984 --> 01:12:00.195
{\an8}<i>I mean, he might be starting to unravel,
we've seen it before.</i>

01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:03.740
<i>His wife, Camille and caddy Wiley
are gonna have to work really hard</i>

01:12:03.824 --> 01:12:07.703
<i>to make sure this young man stays focused
and doesn't fall apart.</i>

01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:09.913
The boy's having
a tough time, huh, Wiley?

01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:12.583
When is Archie
gonna win the big one?

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.836
What kind of career can a guy have
when he don't win the big one?

01:12:15.919 --> 01:12:17.504
One of the great things
of being my age.

01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:19.214
Potential is dust in the wind.

01:12:19.298 --> 01:12:20.716
Oh, I like that song. It's a little grim,

01:12:20.799 --> 01:12:22.968
but if you substitute "lobsters"
for "dust."

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:26.680
<i>♪ Lobsters in the wind ♪</i>

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:30.517
<i>♪ All we are is lobsters in the wind... ♪</i>

01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:53.624
<i>Joe Amable-Amo on the tee
here at the fifth.</i>

01:13:01.298 --> 01:13:02.341
Archie!

01:13:04.426 --> 01:13:06.094
I have to win this tournament.

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.388
But I really believe in you.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:10.849
Let's go, Arch.

01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:13.602
Have I ever told you my recipe for cider?

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:18.607
Oh!

01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.276
<i>Oh, and that is just
a terrible tee shot.</i>

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.446
<i>The only way to say it for Borthwick,
here at the seventh.</i>

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.993
<i>This young man
is definitely starting to...</i>

01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:31.828
<i>Well, his head's about to fall off.</i>

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:37.584
He's got that two-way miss
going, huh, Wiley?

01:13:37.668 --> 01:13:39.586
Wiley. Come on, man.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.630
You tell him to relax,
you're just gonna agitate him.

01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:43.298
Yeah, that's been our pattern.

01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:46.426
Right, Arch. I think you take the seven.
Punch it out in the middle there.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.137
Take your medicine and take the par.

01:13:49.221 --> 01:13:51.390
No, I'll play the three.

01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:54.726
Archie, take the seven.
That's the right club.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.103
Three.

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:57.563
- Come on, man.
- Wiley!

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:01.859
Just give me the club, huh?

01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:03.235
We shouldn't be watching.

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:07.239
It's like looking through
someone's bedroom window.

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.005
Nice and easy swing,
you've done it a thousand times before.

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:24.256
I believe in you.

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:31.180
All you, all day.

01:14:48.989 --> 01:14:51.074
You don't have to feel obligated
to imitate him

01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:52.910
because he has unfulfilled talent.

01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:56.705
Yeah, okay. Let's go find your ball.

01:14:56.788 --> 01:15:00.542
Now his, Lassie couldn't find it
if it was wrapped in bacon.

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:04.588
{\an8}So with a par by Amable-Amo
on this eighth hole,

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.591
{\an8}and that bogie by Borthwick,
Amable-Amo...

01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:09.760
{\an8}Here's a phrase I did not expect to utter.

01:15:09.843 --> 01:15:13.597
{\an8}...is now the leader
of this golf tournament by one stroke.

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.183
{\an8}Well, you know, I wouldn't be
one to say I told you so.

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.351
{\an8}Because you didn't.

01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:19.895
{\an8}No. You're right.
I didn't. I didn't see it either.

01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:22.147
You play your game. Nobody else's.

01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:23.690
Is anyone else's available?

01:15:23.774 --> 01:15:27.194
I'll think of some other clichés
I can throw at you.

01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:29.154
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:31.657
Yeah, sorry, Joe.
I'm not much of a fisherman.

01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:36.370
Carp is a bony, malodorous fish.

01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:39.248
<i>Carpe diem</i> means "seize the day."

01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:43.502
Yeah! My boy Horace, 26 BC,
"Odes."

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:45.879
Yeah, that's right. Ode Horace.

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:47.214
Known to his mates as...

01:15:47.297 --> 01:15:48.465
Sparky.

01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:52.886
Aha! Well done, mate! Cheers.

01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.973
- The guy's all right.
- Thanks for that.

01:16:18.328 --> 01:16:19.288
Attaboy!

01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:34.970
<i>Borthwick
with a fabulous eagle putt.</i>

01:16:35.053 --> 01:16:37.222
<i>Yeah, he seems to have
regained some composure.</i>

01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:40.309
<i>Mm-hmm. And with it,
a share of the lead now.</i>

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.236
<i>Amable-Amo with yet another birdie.</i>

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.156
<i>Yeah, he and his caddy
are certainly having a good time.</i>

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:57.659
<i>I've never seen two sober people
on a golf course have this much fun.</i>

01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:04.416
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo, now the leader
of this golf tournament.

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:08.879
{\an8}But Borthwick is just one behind
after that fabulous eagle on 13.

01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:11.924
<i>Five holes to go.
Who wants it more?</i>

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:15.594
I heard about your family,
the loss you all had.

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.223
It's very kind of you. Thank you.

01:17:19.306 --> 01:17:23.852
Joe! Joe! Joe!

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:39.952
Same as yesterday?

01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:43.121
Right down the middle
left of the sand trap.

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:45.165
Easy swing.

01:17:51.004 --> 01:17:52.756
Watching you, Joe,

01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:56.927
I think Archie might be
getting a lesson in... life.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:59.346
It's him, Wiley. Him.

01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.015
Get in the hole!

01:18:05.102 --> 01:18:09.064
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo
with just an incredible birdie on 14

01:18:09.147 --> 01:18:11.066
{\an8}and still in the lead.

01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:14.570
{\an8}But Borthwick is still on his heels,
just a shot behind.

01:18:14.653 --> 01:18:16.655
{\an8}They're going to have
to wait a little while here

01:18:16.738 --> 01:18:19.032
{\an8}as play has slowed
and the field is really backed up.

01:18:19.116 --> 01:18:20.492
{\an8}Hmm. More time to think,

01:18:20.576 --> 01:18:22.578
{\an8}- which usually, is not a good thing.
- No.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:32.296
The guy's probably lost the ball up there.

01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:45.851
What?

01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:52.065
My family, what we've been through,
what we've lost.

01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:54.693
Well, there's no explanation

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:56.570
that could be understood
at the human level.

01:18:56.653 --> 01:18:59.823
Everything all right, Joe?
You're on the tee box.

01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:05.204
Climax of drama.

01:19:05.287 --> 01:19:07.706
Climax of drama, very exciting.

01:19:17.925 --> 01:19:19.801
You have anything else to offer?

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.929
Now, here. Anything for me?

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:23.847
You gotta have faith, Joe.

01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:26.517
Faith that I can blah, blah, blah.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.560
- Well, in the book of Job...
- Please.

01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:32.022
Joe, who are you to question God?

01:19:33.273 --> 01:19:35.901
Well, supposedly,
the chosen old guy golfer

01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:39.154
sent to prove who the hell knows?

01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:43.951
Pardon the Satanic references
at this juncture.

01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:48.330
"For I know that my Redeemer lives,

01:19:48.413 --> 01:19:51.333
and at last, he will stand
upon the golf course."

01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:55.754
Well, if your Redeemer doesn't get here
by this afternoon,

01:19:55.838 --> 01:19:57.673
there ain't gonna be anyone here.

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.014
I'm here.

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.356
Welcome back, son.

01:20:17.192 --> 01:20:18.318
I love you.

01:20:30.247 --> 01:20:32.249
<i>Amable-Amo,
here's that distance again.</i>

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:35.377
Just about 20 feet for birdie,

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.130
to maintain a share of the lead, David.

01:20:38.213 --> 01:20:41.925
And need I remind everybody,
three million American dollars.

01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:50.809
- Yeah! Whoa!
- Come on!

01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.133
I know you know this, but...

01:21:24.384 --> 01:21:27.554
this tee shot plays
like a slight dogleg left.

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:32.434
Almost ended up
in the water myself yesterday.

01:21:35.562 --> 01:21:36.730
Thank you, Archie.

01:21:43.654 --> 01:21:45.489
You see? He's not a bad guy.

01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.575
He's got daddy issues.

01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:53.747
Dad raised his boy
to be all the things dad wasn't,

01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:55.916
isn't, never will be.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.003
The kid will never,
never win the old man's love

01:22:00.087 --> 01:22:01.630
till he wins a major.

01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:05.509
He sees the kid
marries Miss Illinois.

01:22:06.927 --> 01:22:09.096
Dad says Arch will never hang on to her.

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:11.014
Well, he's wrong so far.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.144
Well, Archie could have
stayed at home

01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:17.938
counting his money
with his beautiful wife.

01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:19.857
Instead, he's here testing himself,

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:23.944
trying to figure out
how to relax under the stress

01:22:24.027 --> 01:22:26.613
of his own and his dad's expectations.

01:22:26.697 --> 01:22:27.781
Hmm.

01:22:28.866 --> 01:22:29.950
You try it.

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:33.620
- He did. Wiley played.
- Yep.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.457
That's why I'm caddying.

01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:38.917
{\an8}This incredible day.

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:42.212
{\an8}This incredible final round
is not done yet.

01:22:42.296 --> 01:22:44.798
{\an8}It all comes down to this, the 18th.

01:22:44.882 --> 01:22:47.426
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo
of Las Cruces, New Mexico

01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:52.514
<i>and Archibald Borthwick of Scotland
tied for the lead.</i>

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:54.766
Whatever happens here, Joe,

01:22:57.519 --> 01:22:59.062
I need you to know that...

01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:05.194
playing this round, it's...

01:23:06.028 --> 01:23:07.279
with you...

01:23:10.282 --> 01:23:11.408
You know what?

01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.168
Good luck.

01:23:24.379 --> 01:23:25.464
You all right?

01:23:29.301 --> 01:23:32.304
Well, here it is.
Your favorite birdie hole.

01:23:33.388 --> 01:23:35.015
Same as yesterday.

01:23:35.098 --> 01:23:37.684
Down the right side, equal to the center.

01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:39.978
Bring us home.

01:23:40.062 --> 01:23:41.813
- Quiet please.
- Thanks, Wiley.

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.533
Get in the hole!

01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:05.379
You know there's no pressure here,
unless of course you think there is.

01:24:06.505 --> 01:24:11.343
I've never felt pressure like this
in my life, Herbie.

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.554
But you know what?

01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:16.056
Yeah. You love it.

01:24:17.558 --> 01:24:21.311
All right. Keep it from going left, yeah.

01:24:24.773 --> 01:24:25.899
Left.

01:25:02.811 --> 01:25:04.021
Left.

01:25:35.761 --> 01:25:38.263
<i>Wait, what? What?
Is that a dove?</i>

01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:44.144
<i>Did a dove just grab Amable-Amo's ball
and drop it in a bush?</i>

01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:48.482
I think I know who might be
responsible for that.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:52.569
<i>The bush is now on fire!
I don't believe what I'm seeing!</i>

01:25:52.653 --> 01:25:54.613
<i>What's next? A pack of locusts?</i>

01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:58.033
<i>We've seen a lot of birdies today,
but nothing quite like that.</i>

01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.202
Thanks. Thanks for doing that.

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:05.958
Is that your ball right there?

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:11.046
Yep. That's my ball.

01:26:11.129 --> 01:26:13.257
I'm afraid it is. That's your ball.

01:26:14.299 --> 01:26:18.303
Joe, you play the ball as it lies
or under rule number 19-1 and 14-3,

01:26:18.387 --> 01:26:20.264
you're allowed to declare the ball
unplayable,

01:26:20.347 --> 01:26:23.016
take a drop with a new ball
and incur a one-stroke penalty.

01:26:24.768 --> 01:26:26.311
Yeah, I think that we should...

01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:31.817
I'll take the one-stroke penalty
and declare it unplayable.

01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:35.487
Burning bush. God says?

01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:38.240
"I will be who I will be."

01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:41.702
{\an8}David, I'm not even sure I believe
what I just saw.

01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:46.039
{\an8}I think it's safe to say
Joe Amable-Amo's ball is unplayable but...

01:26:46.123 --> 01:26:48.041
{\an8}I think it's safe to say
that it's inflammable.

01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:49.126
{\an8}Uh, yeah.

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:51.295
<i>Even, he's gotta laugh at this.</i>

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:54.464
{\an8}I've been tempted all day to say
there's something biblical about this day

01:26:54.548 --> 01:26:56.008
{\an8}and this round of golf.

01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:57.217
{\an8}I'm starting to believe you.

01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:58.802
I've never seen that before.

01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:01.054
Nor have I.

01:27:03.599 --> 01:27:04.850
Deep breaths, Joe.

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:12.983
Enjoy the place. The time. The moment.

01:27:15.277 --> 01:27:16.361
You earned it.

01:27:19.489 --> 01:27:20.699
Thank you, Archie.

01:27:21.491 --> 01:27:22.701
You're a good man.

01:27:58.737 --> 01:27:59.821
Here you go, Archie.

01:28:00.822 --> 01:28:02.699
A little bit of a left to right wind.

01:28:02.783 --> 01:28:04.952
- Look at the pin placement.
- Yeah.

01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:06.828
Okay, 182.

01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:09.206
- 182.
- Put her up there.

01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:34.022
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

01:28:39.111 --> 01:28:40.946
Ow!

01:28:41.029 --> 01:28:43.532
<i>Amable-Amo
needs to make this putt</i>

01:28:43.615 --> 01:28:46.618
{\an8}and have Borthwick miss
for this to be tied

01:28:46.702 --> 01:28:48.704
<i>and we would go to a playoff.</i>

01:28:48.787 --> 01:28:52.416
<i>And with everything that we have seen,
I wouldn't mind seeing more golf.</i>

01:28:52.499 --> 01:28:56.587
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the tournament co-leaders

01:28:56.670 --> 01:29:00.507
from Las Cruces, New Mexico,
Joe Amable-Amo!

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:05.345
<i>Well, here it is, the final hole
of the World Entire.</i>

01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:08.807
Try not to start anything on fire.
Till I get back.

01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:12.519
And from Scotland, Archie Borthwick.

01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:17.691
There's nothing there. Straight up.

01:29:17.774 --> 01:29:20.611
Good speed. Straight putt.

01:29:20.694 --> 01:29:23.363
<i>Borthwick's 12-footer
is a little bit right to left,</i>

01:29:23.447 --> 01:29:26.700
<i>and he's made many of these putts
throughout his career.</i>

01:29:26.783 --> 01:29:31.455
<i>If he makes this one, he's the winner
of the Championship of the World Entire.</i>

01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:33.457
That's all it is.

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.876
A cup and a half out. Right to left.

01:29:35.959 --> 01:29:37.085
All about the speed.

01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:38.921
- A cup and a half?
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.466
<i>If he makes this, folks,
this week,</i>

01:29:42.549 --> 01:29:45.135
<i>this long strange day is over.</i>

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.512
<i>It has been that.</i>

01:29:50.098 --> 01:29:53.560
<i>How many times has Archie Borthwick</i>

01:29:53.644 --> 01:29:57.523
<i>been in a big event
just to see it fall by the wayside?</i>

01:29:57.606 --> 01:30:02.069
<i>Hasn't been able to come through.
But now, has that opportunity.</i>

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.864
<i>Amazing that it would
come down to this.</i>

01:30:07.658 --> 01:30:09.743
<i>This for the win.</i>

01:30:25.175 --> 01:30:29.847
<i>The tap in and now it is up
to Joe Amable-Amo. Amazing.</i>

01:30:32.474 --> 01:30:38.021
<i> Joe Amable-Amo, the 65-year-old
from New Mexico has a five-footer.</i>

01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:40.941
<i>To send this
to a sudden death playoff.</i>

01:30:41.024 --> 01:30:43.652
I have faith you're gonna
make this putt.

01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:45.737
The question is, do you?

01:30:48.657 --> 01:30:51.410
Foolproof, Herb. Foolproof.

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.589
I will be who I will be.

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:48.425
Thank you, AL.

01:31:58.727 --> 01:32:02.105
<i>So the miss for Amable-Amo
and that is it.</i>

01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:08.612
<i>It's Archie Borthwick who's now the winner
of the Championship of the World Entire.</i>

01:32:08.695 --> 01:32:10.781
<i>Do you believe
what we have seen today?</i>

01:32:10.864 --> 01:32:13.367
<i>No, I can't imagine
what this must feel like</i>

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.618
<i>for Archie Borthwick.</i>

01:32:14.701 --> 01:32:16.912
<i>The monkey is finally off his back.</i>

01:32:16.995 --> 01:32:18.997
<i>He's a major winner!</i>

01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:21.458
<i>It's a life-changing moment
for this young man.</i>

01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:28.674
Oh, ye of abundant faith.

01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:32.469
You missed that putt on purpose.

01:32:50.779 --> 01:32:55.951
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
of the Championship of the World Entire,

01:32:56.034 --> 01:32:57.452
Archibald Borthwick!

01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:10.757
You're my champion!

01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:16.346
Yeah!

01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.746
- Congratulations, Champ.
- I know what happened here.

01:33:40.829 --> 01:33:42.789
Woo-hoo!

01:33:42.873 --> 01:33:43.874
Joe.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.084
Thank you, sir.

01:33:46.877 --> 01:33:49.087
Wiley, you've done a good job.

01:33:50.088 --> 01:33:51.131
You're the man.

01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:52.466
Thank you.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.593
Yes!

01:33:59.473 --> 01:34:00.599
Joe!

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.978
Take a deep breath.

01:34:07.022 --> 01:34:09.191
You deserve the feeling you're getting.

01:34:11.193 --> 01:34:12.861
Congratulations.

01:34:13.529 --> 01:34:15.447
You're really a great man.

01:34:18.992 --> 01:34:19.993
Thank you.

01:34:21.078 --> 01:34:22.204
Thank you.

01:34:36.134 --> 01:34:40.138
Mr. Kind-Love,
that was impressive.

01:34:40.973 --> 01:34:42.015
I'm honored.

01:34:42.933 --> 01:34:47.104
Clearly, you are, uh, very coachable.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.024
Herb. Thank you.

01:34:51.108 --> 01:34:52.276
Nice job, Joe.

01:35:04.621 --> 01:35:06.707
{\an8}Joe Amable-Amo, I gotta tell you,

01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:09.084
{\an8}I'm paid to know what to say
in these situations.

01:35:09.168 --> 01:35:12.546
{\an8}Right now, I'm at a loss.
Can you just tell me this?

01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:14.131
Are you a religious man, Joe?

01:35:14.756 --> 01:35:16.425
I am a disciple of AL.

01:35:17.092 --> 01:35:18.010
"AL"?

01:35:18.677 --> 01:35:20.971
The Almighty Lord. God.

01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:23.098
I know you can't accept
the runner-up check,

01:35:23.182 --> 01:35:25.517
but what are you gonna do
with all the endorsements?

01:35:25.601 --> 01:35:27.561
What are you gonna do with those
that may cause you

01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:30.606
to put in a dozen phone lines or so
in that bank in New Mexico?

01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:34.151
Something very selfish.
I'm gonna give it all away.

01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:38.739
- Congratulations on everything.
- Thank you.

01:35:38.822 --> 01:35:41.533
Archie? A heroic victory for you.

01:35:41.617 --> 01:35:44.870
Gutsy maybe, not heroic.

01:35:45.704 --> 01:35:49.249
A hero is someone that gives himself up
for the benefit of others.

01:35:50.667 --> 01:35:53.253
Gentlemen, you gave us
a once-in-a-lifetime show.

01:35:53.337 --> 01:35:55.047
Thank you!

01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:56.381
<i>You did it, so I believe it.</i>

01:35:56.465 --> 01:35:58.217
When you were a kid,

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.427
your old man was a
pretty doggone good golfer.

01:36:00.511 --> 01:36:04.598
Hey! He still is a pretty
doggone good golfer.

01:36:05.724 --> 01:36:06.808
Whoa!

01:36:07.726 --> 01:36:09.853
So, I think I know who you are.

01:36:09.937 --> 01:36:11.480
I'm pretty sure that you do.

01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:21.114
I know. Sandy and I are headed
to North Korea, yeah.

01:36:21.198 --> 01:36:25.619
Yeah, to deliver a message
to someone there of human compassion.

01:36:25.702 --> 01:36:26.828
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

01:36:26.912 --> 01:36:28.830
There you go. He is so good.

01:36:28.914 --> 01:36:30.207
- Thanks for watching him.
- Sure.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.168
Hold out your hand.

01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:38.549
Oh!

01:36:40.551 --> 01:36:41.927
Thanks, Sheila.

01:36:44.179 --> 01:36:45.222
Hold out your hand.

01:36:51.562 --> 01:36:52.729
For the baby.

01:36:52.813 --> 01:36:54.648
- Oh!
- For the...

01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:57.025
Oh, she's gonna be so happy!

01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:58.777
In time to come.

01:36:58.861 --> 01:37:01.029
Excuse me. You have a...

01:37:04.783 --> 01:37:07.077
I guess this is goodbye.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:10.497
It's not goodbye. You know what?
AL didn't give you full disclosure.

01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:12.291
Job's not done yet, Joe.

01:37:12.374 --> 01:37:15.752
You're gonna be delivering this message
for the rest of your life.

01:37:16.712 --> 01:37:18.755
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:37:20.257 --> 01:37:21.967
You and I will see each other again.

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.804
I love you.

01:37:26.471 --> 01:37:27.556
Thank you.

01:37:37.733 --> 01:37:39.067
I'm proud of you, buddy.

01:37:39.151 --> 01:37:40.569
Thank you.

01:37:48.702 --> 01:37:50.037
Come on, honey.

01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:57.753
Hey, everyone. Uh...

01:37:57.836 --> 01:37:59.588
You know my wife, Camille.

01:38:00.756 --> 01:38:03.258
Hi. We met on the course.

01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:10.307
I feel like I know each of you.

01:38:11.391 --> 01:38:13.560
Your love for each other is beautiful.

01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:19.358
Your support and your faith
in your husband is beautiful.

01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:24.947
Joe, Mrs. Amable-Amo, I'm no hero.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.993
But your daughter, Audrey? She is.

01:38:51.098 --> 01:38:53.851
"Pay to the order of Jardin Del Sol.

01:38:53.934 --> 01:38:57.020
Signed, Archibald Borthwick."

01:38:57.104 --> 01:38:59.481
I hope I spelled it right.

01:38:59.565 --> 01:39:01.024
Yes, you spelled it right!

01:39:02.067 --> 01:39:05.153
How can we ever... ever thank you?

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:08.198
Thank you, Joe.

01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:11.952
Thank you.

01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:23.046
Let's go home.
We have a lot to do.

01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:25.007
Oh my God!

01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:27.176
Your garden's going to be overrun.

01:39:36.059 --> 01:39:37.436
Sponge cake!
