10:33.740 --> 10:35.807
and how to handle her.

10:35.807 --> 10:38.344
And you--well, you know her
better than any of us.

10:38.344 --> 10:41.781
Well, I've just heard some
news that may be of interest.

10:41.781 --> 10:43.482
Don't keep us in suspense.

10:43.482 --> 10:47.252
I'm told she has persuaded
Henry Abbey and the others

10:47.252 --> 10:50.289
at the Metropolitan
to open on the same night

10:50.289 --> 10:51.857
as the Academy of Music.

10:51.857 --> 10:53.427
- What?
- Are you serious?

10:53.427 --> 10:54.493
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my.

10:54.493 --> 10:56.663
How dare they try to steal
the Academy's thunder.

10:56.663 --> 10:58.364
Our date is sacred.

10:58.364 --> 11:00.933
I suppose, in a way,
this makes it a cleaner fight.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.168
How?

11:02.168 --> 11:03.869
Well, everyone will have to
choose which side they're on.

11:03.869 --> 11:05.104
Why was that necessary?

11:05.104 --> 11:07.874
Thank heavens we are
all united in this house.

11:07.874 --> 11:10.309
There must be room
for two opera houses

11:10.309 --> 11:11.677
in a city like New York.

11:11.677 --> 11:13.580
Nonsense.
Now what can we do?

11:13.580 --> 11:14.613
Give us orders.

11:14.613 --> 11:16.449
In your letter,
you said you had a task for me.

11:16.449 --> 11:17.583
Yes.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.319
Agnes, I would like you to
write to the older members.

11:20.319 --> 11:22.721
Say that you've heard a rumor
that if any of them

11:22.721 --> 11:25.057
are thinking of taking a box
at the Metropolitan,

11:25.057 --> 11:26.959
their box at the Academy
will be removed.

11:26.959 --> 11:28.094
- Goodness.
- Seriously?

11:28.094 --> 11:31.397
I can't do it, as that would
make the threat official.

11:31.397 --> 11:32.464
But you can.

11:32.464 --> 11:33.733
Have got all that,
Miss Scott?

11:33.733 --> 11:34.868
Every word.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.235
We'll begin
the letters at once.

11:36.235 --> 11:37.264
Won't we, Miss Scott?

11:37.264 --> 11:39.438
- Of course.
- Thank you.

11:39.438 --> 11:40.940
I think I'll take my leave

11:40.940 --> 11:43.442
before you start
handing out weapons.

11:43.442 --> 11:45.314
If only it were that simple.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.383
Well, Mrs. Astor's
really looking for a fight.

11:50.383 --> 11:51.650
I heard her.

11:51.650 --> 11:53.853
I wouldn't say
Mrs. Russell has a chance.

11:53.853 --> 11:55.588
I knew Mrs. Van Rhijn
was right.

11:55.588 --> 11:56.888
Things must be heating up

11:56.888 --> 11:59.425
if Mrs. Astor's paying calls
to get people on her side.

11:59.425 --> 12:00.794
Miss Marian supports the Met.

12:00.794 --> 12:02.862
- So do I.
- And where will that get you?

12:02.862 --> 12:04.496
It's what I think,
that's all.

12:04.496 --> 12:06.899
You only think that because
Miss Adelheid Weber does.

12:06.899 --> 12:08.868
The mistress
has got Miss Scott

12:08.868 --> 12:11.070
writing to all
the Academy members,

12:11.070 --> 12:13.106
to make sure they hold firm.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.140
What?

12:14.140 --> 12:16.409
She can't write letters
to that sort of people.

12:16.409 --> 12:17.476
Why not?

12:17.476 --> 12:21.014
When a fight is big enough,
everyone gets sucked in.

12:21.014 --> 12:22.809
So Henderson
is traveling today?

12:22.809 --> 12:26.385
He is, and we have reserved
a suite at the Brunswick.

12:26.385 --> 12:28.121
And a carriage for tomorrow?

12:28.121 --> 12:29.488
Yes.

12:29.488 --> 12:32.024
Hope it doesn't make him think
he has power over us.

12:32.024 --> 12:33.687
He's not the first man
I've dealt with

12:33.687 --> 12:36.028
who has exaggerated ideas
of his own importance.

12:36.028 --> 12:38.598
I humor him to get him
to reveal his price.

12:38.598 --> 12:40.700
Suppose he hasn't got one?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.434
Oh, he has.

12:42.434 --> 12:45.638
He may tease us a little
so we raise our offer,

12:45.638 --> 12:48.107
but every man living
has a price.

12:48.107 --> 12:51.477
<i>♪ ♪</i>

12:51.477 --> 12:52.578
All right.

12:52.578 --> 12:53.880
The first tier has
all been claimed.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.682
However,
there are a few boxes...

12:55.682 --> 12:56.783
Where's Mr. Russell?

12:56.783 --> 12:58.685
At his office.
He slipped away.

12:58.685 --> 13:00.419
Is he enjoying the opera war?

13:00.419 --> 13:02.722
Well, he'd like to know if
you're going to take a box.

13:02.722 --> 13:03.783
So would I.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.225
You need more of the old
crowd in your audience.

13:06.225 --> 13:08.527
Recruit a few of them,
and I'll see.

13:08.527 --> 13:11.030
Now, where do the
Wintertons stand?

13:11.030 --> 13:14.366
She may be new,
but her husband's money is not,

13:14.366 --> 13:16.269
and her social standing
is gathering pace.

13:16.269 --> 13:17.403
Oh?

13:17.403 --> 13:19.071
They spent their
wedding journey in England,

13:19.071 --> 13:21.173
courting the aristocracy.

13:21.173 --> 13:22.942
Thank you
for having me today.

13:22.942 --> 13:24.878
I wish we could sign you up.

13:24.878 --> 13:27.412
I'm afraid we're very happy
at the Academy.

13:27.412 --> 13:30.015
At one time, I knew a woman
who was really desperate

13:30.015 --> 13:32.618
to get on their list, so I feel
it would be most ungrateful

13:32.618 --> 13:34.286
for me not to enjoy it.

13:34.286 --> 13:36.489
Did your friend ever
get their box at last?

13:36.489 --> 13:37.790
No.

13:37.790 --> 13:39.625
But like so many others
who failed,

13:39.625 --> 13:41.093
she now supports the Met.

13:41.093 --> 13:42.195
Oh.

13:42.195 --> 13:44.596
I was just telling Mrs. Russell
of all your friends

13:44.596 --> 13:47.399
you made in Europe, not least
the Duke of Buckingham.

13:47.399 --> 13:49.736
Mr. Winterton has many
friends in England,

13:49.736 --> 13:51.370
the Duke of Buckingham
among them.

13:51.370 --> 13:54.006
He entertained us while we were
there at his place in Devon.

13:54.006 --> 13:55.240
How interesting.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.276
And now
he's coming to America.

13:57.276 --> 13:59.946
Yes, we are to receive him
in Newport.

13:59.946 --> 14:01.280
Oh, would you excuse me?

14:01.280 --> 14:03.316
I want a word with Mrs. Wilson
before she leaves.

14:03.316 --> 14:06.319
But when I get back,
can I please see your ballroom?

14:06.319 --> 14:07.920
Of course.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.421
Mrs. Fish.

14:09.421 --> 14:11.524
Oh, Alice.
I'll join you in the hall.

14:11.524 --> 14:12.919
[laughs]

14:12.919 --> 14:15.528
I heard you were able to fill
that ballroom after all.

14:15.528 --> 14:16.996
It was a special night,

14:16.996 --> 14:19.131
as you'd have seen
if you'd stayed.

14:19.131 --> 14:21.201
Though you would have been
there in a different capacity,

14:21.201 --> 14:24.537
of course.

14:24.537 --> 14:28.307
Well, I hope you'll think
of joining our ranks.

14:28.307 --> 14:30.543
Would you,
if you were in my place?

14:30.543 --> 14:32.672
[scoffs] I understood
the earlier reference.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.747
But you could have a box
in both houses.

14:34.747 --> 14:36.949
Why, when it will take
the Met years

14:36.949 --> 14:39.151
even to begin to compete?

14:39.151 --> 14:41.053
It's a second-rate project,

14:41.053 --> 14:44.857
and it will be second-rate
for both our lifetimes.

14:44.857 --> 14:47.092
Or are you threatening me
with exposure?

14:47.092 --> 14:48.795
[scoffs] I have no wish
to make trouble.

14:48.795 --> 14:50.028
Good.

14:50.028 --> 14:52.865
Because if you make trouble
for me, I will respond in kind.

14:52.865 --> 14:54.333
- I don't understand.
- If I were you,

14:54.333 --> 14:56.068
I would discuss it with George
before you decide

14:56.068 --> 14:57.937
to stir things up.
- George?

14:57.937 --> 14:59.739
You mean Mr. Russell.

14:59.739 --> 15:02.842
So he never told you
about us?

15:02.842 --> 15:04.844
Funny, I thought that was why
I was sacked.

15:04.844 --> 15:07.179
Because you were jealous.
- Jealous of what?

15:07.179 --> 15:10.186
You should ask your husband.

15:15.691 --> 15:17.524
Oh, Mrs. Russell.

15:17.524 --> 15:19.558
I'm ready for my tour.

15:19.558 --> 15:22.128
I still can't believe it.
I had to see her for myself.

15:22.128 --> 15:26.394
So, Miss Turner is now
a great lady in New York.

15:26.394 --> 15:27.700
It makes you think.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.602
If she can do it, anyone can.

15:29.602 --> 15:31.405
I wonder how she managed it.

15:31.405 --> 15:33.239
How do you think?

15:33.239 --> 15:35.641
She saw what she wanted,
and she went for it.

15:35.641 --> 15:36.976
Peter, how do you know that?

15:36.976 --> 15:38.410
She told me.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.780
Have you kept up with her
since she left here?

15:40.780 --> 15:43.116
From time to time.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.384
So Mr. Winterton
was a marked man.

15:45.384 --> 15:47.019
Why do you think
she chose him?

15:47.019 --> 15:49.421
Mm.
I can answer that.

15:49.421 --> 15:51.423
He's been in the newspaper
a lot lately

15:51.423 --> 15:53.793
as one of the greatest donors
to the new Museum of Art.

15:53.793 --> 15:55.828
He gave millions.

15:55.828 --> 15:57.997
That's what
she was looking for.

15:57.997 --> 15:59.532
I wonder how
she pulled it off.

15:59.532 --> 16:01.267
She wrote,

16:01.267 --> 16:03.836
praising his taste
and his philanthropy,

16:03.836 --> 16:05.905
his culture and his wisdom,

16:05.905 --> 16:07.406
and she hoped that one day
they might meet.

16:07.406 --> 16:09.943
And that's all it took?
One letter?

16:09.943 --> 16:12.645
That's not quite all it took.

16:12.645 --> 16:15.382
[all chuckling]

16:15.382 --> 16:16.616
[gavel thunking]

16:16.616 --> 16:18.617
Oh, Miss Scott.

16:18.617 --> 16:21.020
I may be away for a while,
so I've written down some ideas

16:21.020 --> 16:22.788
for you to work on
while I'm gone.

16:22.788 --> 16:24.023
Where are you off to?

16:24.023 --> 16:25.892
Booker T. Washington
is opening a dormitory

16:25.892 --> 16:27.326
at the Tuskegee State
Normal School,

16:27.326 --> 16:29.128
and he's invited me
to cover the event.

16:29.128 --> 16:30.697
You know everyone.

16:30.697 --> 16:31.865
Well, I met Mr. Washington

16:31.865 --> 16:33.667
when he was here last year
raising money.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.968
Tell me about him.

16:34.968 --> 16:36.601
Well, he's intelligent
and driven,

16:36.601 --> 16:39.005
and quite adept
at getting large donations.

16:39.005 --> 16:41.073
Alfred Haynes Porter
funded this dormitory,

16:41.073 --> 16:43.208
so our angle will be
how white Brooklyn money

16:43.208 --> 16:45.144
is building a colored
institution at Tuskegee.

16:45.144 --> 16:46.774
No one would ever know that.

16:46.774 --> 16:48.181
Which is why
we're doing the story.

16:48.181 --> 16:52.118
[laughs]
Well, good for Mr. Washington.

16:52.118 --> 16:55.688
Oh, I suppose now they can
take students from anywhere,

16:55.688 --> 16:57.756
with the new dormitory.
- Well, that's the idea.

16:57.756 --> 17:00.727
But I don't know why
a colored student from New York

17:00.727 --> 17:02.561
would go all the way to Alabama

17:02.561 --> 17:04.663
just to learn
how to be a farm laborer.

17:04.663 --> 17:06.899
Well, I read that
Mr. Washington also trains

17:06.899 --> 17:08.467
the students in teaching.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.169
I know they promise
to be teachers for two years

17:10.169 --> 17:12.104
when they finish,
but after that's done,

17:12.104 --> 17:13.707
it seems they only get offered
the kind of jobs

17:13.707 --> 17:15.074
white people want to give them.

17:15.074 --> 17:16.442
Perhaps Mr. Washington sees

17:16.442 --> 17:18.177
what he's doing
as the first step.

17:18.177 --> 17:20.146
Well, that's what
I need to ask him.

17:20.146 --> 17:22.281
[laughs]
I envy you.

17:22.281 --> 17:24.784
I'd love to write
a story like that.

17:24.784 --> 17:26.018
Where will you stay?

17:26.018 --> 17:27.821
With Mr. Washington
and his wife.

17:27.821 --> 17:29.254
He wants publicity
for the school,

17:29.254 --> 17:31.190
so he's excited
for me to come there.

17:31.190 --> 17:33.125
When were you last
in the South?

17:33.125 --> 17:35.160
Not for many years.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.830
And when I lived there,
I was a slave.

17:37.830 --> 17:40.332
Oh. I see.

17:40.332 --> 17:42.805
No, you don't.
Because you can't.

17:44.605 --> 17:48.141
But somehow,
I have to put that behind me.

17:48.141 --> 17:51.643
When Booker T. Washington
calls, I must go.

17:51.643 --> 17:53.880
Well, I hope you'll consider
his point of view.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.414
So you like the idea

17:55.414 --> 17:58.918
of our highest ambition
being to milk a cow?

17:58.918 --> 18:00.754
I'll tell you
what I do like--

18:00.754 --> 18:02.922
when colored people open doors,

18:02.922 --> 18:05.090
when they help others
to earn a living.

18:05.090 --> 18:07.292
I like independence
and self-reliance.

18:07.292 --> 18:09.628
And even if it's not perfect,

18:09.628 --> 18:13.966
this Tuskegee school seems like
a step in the right direction.

18:13.966 --> 18:16.469
I'll tell Mr. Washington
you said so.

18:16.469 --> 18:20.006
I wish I could
tell him myself.

18:20.006 --> 18:21.340
You know it would
be highly unusual

18:21.340 --> 18:22.942
for us to travel together.

18:22.942 --> 18:24.376
Because I'm a woman?

18:24.376 --> 18:25.945
We must live
in the real world.

18:25.945 --> 18:27.279
But I became a journalist

18:27.279 --> 18:29.452
to cover stories
exactly like this.

18:33.421 --> 18:34.715
I'll think about it.

18:34.715 --> 18:36.459
- Is that a yes?
- Not quite.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.197
All right.

18:44.532 --> 18:45.765
<i>I should get back to work.</i>

18:45.765 --> 18:47.033
Why?

18:47.033 --> 18:49.668
Do you have a cruel mistress
who never allows you time off?

18:49.668 --> 18:52.371
She's an absolute tyrant,
take it from me.

a house like this before,

28:56.909 --> 28:59.044
and I don't suppose
I ever will again.

28:59.044 --> 29:00.813
Then I hope you enjoy yourself.

29:00.813 --> 29:02.081
Was your hotel comfortable?

29:02.081 --> 29:04.984
I've never been
so comfortable before.

29:04.984 --> 29:06.051
Ah.

29:06.051 --> 29:09.225
Our luncheon is ready,
so let us go in and eat it.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.226
[clears throat]

29:13.226 --> 29:15.528
I might be going away
for a few days.

29:15.528 --> 29:17.296
Oh?
Where are you going?

29:17.296 --> 29:18.964
Tuskegee, Alabama.

29:18.964 --> 29:21.935
Mr. Fortune and I are doing
a story on a school down there.

29:21.935 --> 29:23.903
I've already asked
Mrs. Van Rhijn's permission.

29:23.903 --> 29:26.072
You said might be.
So it's not definite?

29:26.072 --> 29:28.240
[sighs] Mr. Fortune hasn't
officially decided,

29:28.240 --> 29:30.676
but I've made
a good case for myself.

29:30.676 --> 29:32.412
I don't believe he'll refuse.

29:32.412 --> 29:33.913
Who else is going?

29:33.913 --> 29:35.347
Well,
he didn't mention anyone.

29:35.347 --> 29:37.183
Well, you can't go
all the way to Alabama

29:37.183 --> 29:38.752
alone with a man.

29:38.752 --> 29:39.952
I've told you.

29:39.952 --> 29:43.222
It is a professional trip,
and Mr. Fortune is my employer.

29:43.222 --> 29:46.059
He's also a man,
and a married one.

29:46.059 --> 29:47.392
[sighs]

29:47.392 --> 29:48.932
Be careful. That's all.

29:50.865 --> 29:52.899
Have you always
lived in Pittsburgh?

29:52.899 --> 29:54.500
No.
I was born in New Jersey,

29:54.500 --> 29:55.835
but I moved there for the work.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.036
But my wife's from Pittsburgh.

29:57.036 --> 29:59.239
How long have
you been married?

29:59.239 --> 30:00.306
23 years.

30:00.306 --> 30:01.874
We have six children
to show for it.

30:01.874 --> 30:03.208
Six! Heavens.

30:03.208 --> 30:04.810
We have all we can
handle with two.

30:04.810 --> 30:06.713
[laughs]
No, Susie works as well.

30:06.713 --> 30:07.981
She's a dressmaker.

30:07.981 --> 30:09.182
Mm. I admire her.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.151
Well, we have
to make ends meet.

30:11.151 --> 30:12.319
Mm.

30:12.319 --> 30:13.419
[clears throat]

30:13.419 --> 30:15.921
Why not take Mr. Henderson
through to the library?

30:15.921 --> 30:18.391
You can speak
more freely there.

30:18.391 --> 30:20.292
[laughter]
- It's true.

30:20.292 --> 30:22.895
And the worst thing is
that Marian has shown up

30:22.895 --> 30:24.864
Frances's other teachers.

30:24.864 --> 30:27.633
In her opinion, they are wrong.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.669
Only Miss Brook can do right.

30:29.669 --> 30:30.970
[all chuckle]

30:30.970 --> 30:32.304
Frances is an adorable child.

30:32.304 --> 30:34.006
But I must ask her
to be more tolerant.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.508
I wish you success,
as she may insist

30:36.508 --> 30:38.978
you take all her lessons,
and not just watercolors.

30:38.978 --> 30:40.613
You paint in watercolors?

30:40.613 --> 30:42.549
She does.
And very well.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.416
- Thank you.
- How pleasing.

30:44.416 --> 30:46.886
The showy oil paintings
of the masters

30:46.886 --> 30:48.821
normally get all the attention,

30:48.821 --> 30:50.990
but watercolors
have a champion in me.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.458
Oh, me too.
I just love them.

30:53.458 --> 30:56.162
Really, Ada?
I'd never heard you say that.

30:56.162 --> 30:58.932
Which watercolorist
do you especially favor?

30:58.932 --> 31:02.168
[laughs]
I know you mean to catch me out,

31:02.168 --> 31:04.036
but it happens
that I admire

31:04.036 --> 31:06.839
the German painter
Adolph Menzel.

31:06.839 --> 31:08.307
A marvelous fellow.

31:08.307 --> 31:11.210
He works in such
a range of styles.

31:11.210 --> 31:13.446
Aren't they mounting
a Menzel exhibition here?

31:13.446 --> 31:15.482
What is this?

31:15.482 --> 31:16.916
Soup.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.918
Soup? At luncheon?

31:18.918 --> 31:21.253
Wasn't it George IV
who decreed

31:21.253 --> 31:23.556
that no gentleman drinks soup
in the middle of the day?

31:23.556 --> 31:24.924
[laughter]

31:24.924 --> 31:27.026
This is New England
clam chowder.

31:27.026 --> 31:29.094
I thought it would
be a surprise.

31:29.094 --> 31:31.096
And so it is.
How did it get on my table?

31:31.096 --> 31:33.198
I conspired with Mrs. Bauer.

31:33.198 --> 31:34.794
And why was that, Aunt Ada?

31:34.794 --> 31:37.269
The Reverend mentioned
that he was in search

31:37.269 --> 31:40.473
of an authentic bowl of chowder
here in New York.

31:40.473 --> 31:42.141
I believe I did.

31:42.141 --> 31:44.376
So I set our cook
to the task.

31:44.376 --> 31:46.946
We went through
quite a few receipts.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.616
I hope you agree
with her choice.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.250
It smells delicious.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.786
Well, if we discuss the soup
any longer,

31:53.786 --> 31:55.588
it won't be fit to drink.

31:55.588 --> 31:57.460
Quite right, Mrs. Van Rhijn.

32:00.027 --> 32:01.995
I'm looking forward to the
evening with Oscar Wilde.

32:01.995 --> 32:04.263
Oh, I've read nothing
about the play.

32:04.263 --> 32:07.733
But we know him a little from
one of our visits to England.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.434
He's such an entertaining man.

32:09.434 --> 32:11.737
And Miss Beaton
will be in the party.

32:11.737 --> 32:13.673
I'm glad. I like her.

32:13.673 --> 32:15.207
And I think she likes you.

32:15.207 --> 32:17.276
But you must promise me
not to break her heart.

32:17.276 --> 32:19.778
You have a very
poor opinion of me.

32:19.778 --> 32:22.015
Are there more New England
treats waiting in the wings?

32:22.015 --> 32:24.183
No. Just the soup.

32:24.183 --> 32:26.618
- How kind of you, Aunt Ada.
- I agree.

32:26.618 --> 32:30.523
And it is kindness that does
the most good in the world.

32:30.523 --> 32:32.325
Well said, Reverend.

32:32.325 --> 32:35.431
- More wine, ma'am?
- Definitely.

32:36.965 --> 32:38.130
Where shall we start?

32:38.130 --> 32:40.366
Why not begin with
the simple facts?

32:40.366 --> 32:41.433
[grunts]

32:41.433 --> 32:43.235
Your average steel man
works 12 hours a day,

32:43.235 --> 32:45.872
six days a week,
and all for a pittance.

32:45.872 --> 32:47.506
When the bell sounds
their release,

32:47.506 --> 32:50.643
they're too broken for anything
more than a mouthful of food

32:50.643 --> 32:52.211
and sleep.

32:52.211 --> 32:55.014
It's an existence.
It's not a life.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.583
You know I cannot
pay my workers

32:56.583 --> 32:57.884
more than the normal rate.

32:57.884 --> 32:59.385
- Why not?
- It would upset the markets,

32:59.385 --> 33:01.716
which would not benefit anyone.

33:01.716 --> 33:04.223
I dare say, in time,
wages will rise.

33:04.223 --> 33:05.825
But you must let
these things evolve.

33:05.825 --> 33:09.457
And working conditions, hmm?

33:09.457 --> 33:10.596
Must they evolve too,

33:10.596 --> 33:12.698
while men are maimed and killed
through bad practice?

33:12.698 --> 33:16.035
Life is a dangerous business,
Mr. Henderson.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.303
I'm a patron of the
Brooklyn Bridge,

33:18.303 --> 33:20.406
and more than 20 men have died
in its construction.

33:20.406 --> 33:22.141
Would you rather
it had not been built,

33:22.141 --> 33:23.776
and New York was forever
a divided city?

33:23.776 --> 33:26.212
- No.
- No.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.782
We cannot make the world
a padded cell,

33:28.782 --> 33:30.316
even for the comfort
of your workers.

33:30.316 --> 33:32.084
Things are changing,
Mr. Russell.

33:32.084 --> 33:33.786
Unions are stronger, now.

33:33.786 --> 33:35.021
They will grow stronger still,

33:35.021 --> 33:36.255
and you will have
to deal with them.

33:36.255 --> 33:38.057
I am a man of business.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.459
And I have jobs to offer
in my mills,

33:40.459 --> 33:42.828
in my factories,
and on my railroads.

33:42.828 --> 33:44.563
And I pay the going rate.

33:44.563 --> 33:46.766
If your men don't want
to work for me,

33:46.766 --> 33:48.300
then I suggest they step aside

33:48.300 --> 33:49.835
and make way
for the many who do.

33:49.835 --> 33:50.870
Is that all you have to say?

33:50.870 --> 33:52.004
Did I come to New York
to hear that?

33:52.004 --> 33:55.441
Not quite.

33:55.441 --> 33:57.642
What if I offered you
a job in management?

33:57.642 --> 33:59.613
Is there any chance
that you might take it?

33:59.613 --> 34:02.081
[scoffs]
Why would I?

34:02.081 --> 34:03.883
To see your
children healthy,

34:03.883 --> 34:06.419
well fed,
and in the best schools.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.221
To let your wife give up her
sewing, if she so wishes.

34:09.221 --> 34:13.292
To be a figure in the community,
valued and admired.

34:13.292 --> 34:14.994
So it would be
to my own advantage?

34:14.994 --> 34:16.229
Indeed it would.

34:16.229 --> 34:17.930
And how would that
help the workforce?

34:17.930 --> 34:21.000
Oh, I see how it is.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.502
You are Saint Michael
with a flaming sword,

34:23.502 --> 34:25.971
and I am just
a greedy robber baron.

34:25.971 --> 34:28.708
[chuckles]
You used the phrase.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.577
Not I.

34:30.577 --> 34:32.673
<i>[soft tense music]</i>

34:32.673 --> 34:35.514
You're very good, you know.

34:35.514 --> 34:38.083
They were right to send you
as their spokesman.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.284
All we're asking
is for you to do

34:39.284 --> 34:41.553
the right thing, Mr. Russell.

34:41.553 --> 34:43.122
I pay you the compliment
of being sure

34:43.122 --> 34:45.291
that you know what
the right thing would be.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.526
I hope you believe me.

34:47.526 --> 34:51.330
I believe in your sincerity,
Mr. Henderson, I do.

34:51.330 --> 34:53.398
But do you believe workers
can win against capital?

34:53.398 --> 34:57.637
Of which I blush to say
I have a great deal.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.239
Ah.

35:00.239 --> 35:03.208
Now I understand why
you brought me here.

35:03.208 --> 35:05.377
But you're wrong, Mr. Russell.

35:05.377 --> 35:08.347
You have miscalculated.

35:08.347 --> 35:11.317
The future is on our side.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.454
And now I should go.

35:14.454 --> 35:18.757
<i>♪ ♪</i>

35:18.757 --> 35:21.360
Well, I've never been
west of the Mississippi.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.828
I'd like to see
the Pacific Ocean.

35:23.828 --> 35:26.599
I read that the California
winter is like our fall,

35:26.599 --> 35:29.769
except the leaves
don't change their color.

35:29.769 --> 35:31.337
I think I'd miss that.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.140
You'll go to San Francisco, then?

35:34.140 --> 35:36.976
[sighs]
I'm still undecided.

35:36.976 --> 35:38.744
It's a strange thing,

35:38.744 --> 35:42.415
to be forced out
of your child's life twice.

35:42.415 --> 35:45.151
Of course, when I first left,
she was just a little girl.

35:45.151 --> 35:46.318
It wasn't her fault.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.420
So you think she had a hand
in this proposition, then?

35:48.420 --> 35:50.489
Well, I can't imagine
that he would

35:50.489 --> 35:52.758
banish her own father to the
other side of the country

35:52.758 --> 35:54.159
without consulting her.

35:54.159 --> 35:55.395
I suppose.

35:55.395 --> 35:57.430
Maybe it was her idea.

35:57.430 --> 36:00.367
He just served
as the executioner.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.068
I don't have children,

36:02.068 --> 36:03.936
so I can't speak
to how it must feel.

36:03.936 --> 36:07.239
But you are still,
and will always be, her father.

36:07.239 --> 36:09.642
No one can change that.

36:09.642 --> 36:11.577
Maybe.

36:11.577 --> 36:14.981
But they are certainly trying
to erase any reminder of it.

36:14.981 --> 36:16.582
How did it go, Mr. Church?

36:16.582 --> 36:19.318
Well, I'm not used to serving
horny-handed sons of toil,

36:19.318 --> 36:20.652
but it seemed to go
fairly well.

36:20.652 --> 36:22.489
Did the mistress turn up
in the end?

36:22.489 --> 36:23.723
Oh, yes.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.623
Cool as a cucumber.

36:24.623 --> 36:26.058
Butter wouldn't melt
in her mouth.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.459
What's the argument about?

36:27.459 --> 36:29.261
I don't know,
but she hasn't forgiven him.

36:29.261 --> 36:30.395
Not yet.
- She will.

36:30.395 --> 36:31.731
Has the union man gone?

36:31.731 --> 36:33.032
Yes, and good riddance.

36:33.032 --> 36:34.400
All unions do
is make everything

36:34.400 --> 36:36.869
worse than it was before.

36:36.869 --> 36:39.338
I'm not sure that's quite
the whole picture, Mr. Church.

36:39.338 --> 36:41.907
What if they started
a servants' union?

36:41.907 --> 36:43.342
Would you join it?

36:43.342 --> 36:45.878
I'd rather be struck dead
by lightning.

36:45.878 --> 36:48.451
I take it that's a no.

36:52.754 --> 36:56.088
Thank you for today.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.823
He hasn't backed down.

36:57.823 --> 37:00.026
I can only hope I've given him
something to think about.

37:00.026 --> 37:03.229
Good.

37:03.229 --> 37:05.098
Are you going up to dress?

37:05.098 --> 37:09.202
No.
I'll have a tray in my room.

37:09.202 --> 37:10.503
Will the children
dine with me,

37:10.503 --> 37:12.005
or have you made other plans?

37:12.005 --> 37:15.441
This is our quarrel,
not theirs.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.310
But they're both going
to the theater tonight,

37:17.310 --> 37:19.446
so you'll eat on your own.

don't disappoint.

But what's your verdict?

41:37.470 --> 41:39.305
It was interesting.

41:39.305 --> 41:40.505
- Interesting...
- Mm-hmm.

41:40.505 --> 41:42.609
Is a weasel word,
and generally used

41:42.609 --> 41:45.578

I liked Marie Prescott.

41:47.280 --> 41:48.414
Yes.

41:48.414 --> 41:49.382
She's, uh--
she's glamorous enough

41:49.382 --> 41:50.783

42:02.027 --> 42:02.962
Oh.

42:02.962 --> 42:05.264
I hope you enjoyed the play,
Miss Russell.

42:05.264 --> 42:07.967
Is "enjoy" the right word
when a tsar is murdered,

42:07.967 --> 42:10.435

the heroine stabbing herself?

Gladys Russell?

42:25.118 --> 42:26.519
As a friend.

42:26.519 --> 42:28.253
What if she wants
more from you?

42:28.253 --> 42:31.194
She'll be disappointed,
as I'm already spoken for.

42:33.829 --> 42:35.060
Have he and I met?

42:35.060 --> 42:36.563
No.

42:36.563 --> 42:38.931
But I'll introduce you soon.

42:38.931 --> 42:42.134
Oh.

42:42.134 --> 42:43.402
Are you happy with him?

42:43.402 --> 42:45.571
Oscar, I'm happy with me.

42:45.571 --> 42:49.242
That's as much as
I need or hope for.

42:49.242 --> 42:51.544
I rather envy you.

42:51.544 --> 42:53.446
Who is Miss Russell?

42:53.446 --> 42:55.681
One of your famous heiresses,
I suppose?

42:55.681 --> 42:57.717
How clever you are,
Mr. Wilde.

42:57.717 --> 43:00.680
Yes, one of the
greatest of her year.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.890
Well, it seems we're in
a room full of young heiresses.

43:03.890 --> 43:06.059
Which is your cousin
sounding out?

43:06.059 --> 43:08.560
I shouldn't admit it,
but of course you're right.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.930
He has his eye on
Miss Beaton now.

43:10.930 --> 43:13.265
And the young man with him?

43:13.265 --> 43:16.503
John Adams.
He's an old friend of Oscar's.

43:16.503 --> 43:17.836
Is he, indeed?

43:17.836 --> 43:19.572
Yes, I can see that
getting rather complicated.

43:19.572 --> 43:21.607
I don't know what you mean.

43:21.607 --> 43:25.114
Nor should you.
You're far too well brought up.

43:30.718 --> 43:32.051
Have you not heard
of the opera battle

43:32.051 --> 43:33.420
that's being waged
at the moment?

43:33.420 --> 43:34.754
No, indeed, I have.

43:34.754 --> 43:36.022
Though it seems
strange to me to wage

43:36.022 --> 43:37.957
a war over that
yellow brick brewery

43:37.957 --> 43:39.692
on Broadway and 39th Street.

43:39.692 --> 43:41.160
Is that fair?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.461
No, you're quite right.

43:42.461 --> 43:43.930
If it were actually
a brewery,

43:43.930 --> 43:45.630
someone might hope
to get some pleasure from it.

43:45.630 --> 43:49.335
We're proud of our opera,
Mr. Wilde.

43:49.335 --> 43:50.402
It has been my experience

43:50.402 --> 43:51.971
that you are proud
of many things

43:51.971 --> 43:55.041
that would not translate
to the old world.

43:55.041 --> 43:57.176
- Hmm.
- But is the old world better?

43:57.176 --> 44:00.316
Not better, exactly.
Just more tested by time.

44:03.185 --> 44:04.120

44:05.487 --> 44:06.986
You're back so soon.

44:06.986 --> 44:08.487
I thought you were
in Newport all summer.

44:08.487 --> 44:10.357
I went with Mr. Church
and Mr. Watson,

44:10.357 --> 44:11.556
the master's valet.

44:11.556 --> 44:12.592
But we all came back
much sooner

44:12.592 --> 44:14.093
than Mr. Church expected.

44:14.093 --> 44:16.228
What's the Newport house
like?

44:16.228 --> 44:17.863
Gracious and grand.

44:17.863 --> 44:19.532
They called it a cottage.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.934
It's not like a cottage to me.

44:21.934 --> 44:24.203
I like the town, though.
We'll go back soon.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.705
We're only here for
the mistress's tea party.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.206
How'd it go?

44:27.206 --> 44:29.775
Do you know about Miss Turner,
the lady's maid?

44:29.775 --> 44:32.344
She turned up at the party
as a guest.

44:32.344 --> 44:34.213
- What?
- It's true.

44:34.213 --> 44:37.049
She's married
a rich old property man,

44:37.049 --> 44:38.451
and now she's
the talk of the town.

44:38.451 --> 44:40.386
What does Mrs. Russell
say to that?

44:40.386 --> 44:41.688
There's not much
she can say,

44:41.688 --> 44:43.055
but I don't think she likes it.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.451
Not one bit.

44:44.451 --> 44:45.857
Mrs. Van Rhijn
wouldn't like it much

44:45.857 --> 44:48.728
if Miss Armstrong left and
came back as Mrs. Rockefeller.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.597
- [laughs]
- Anyway.

44:50.597 --> 44:52.597
I'd better get back.

44:52.597 --> 44:54.837
Hurry now.
Don't let that fall.

45:00.142 --> 45:03.342
I have some contributions
for the rummage sale.

45:03.342 --> 45:05.411
In there?
Thank you so much.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.614
- I understand.
- Not one bit.

Miss Brook!

45:11.284 --> 45:12.619
Is everything all right?

45:12.619 --> 45:15.420
Oh, Mr. Dawson
had a low opinion

45:15.420 --> 45:17.256
of how we give out communion.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.125
What part of it
was he criticizing?

45:19.125 --> 45:20.960
The part where
I offer communion

45:20.960 --> 45:23.529
to those he deems undeserving.

45:23.529 --> 45:25.364
What you must
have to put up with.

45:25.364 --> 45:28.968
Let's just say some of God's
children can be very tiresome.

45:28.968 --> 45:31.804
[laughs]
Are you allowed to say that?

45:31.804 --> 45:33.272
Can't I, to you?

45:33.272 --> 45:35.442
Of course you can.

45:35.442 --> 45:36.710
We're friends.

45:36.710 --> 45:40.414
Good.

that you had

45:44.617 --> 45:45.919
your cook prepare the chowder.

45:45.919 --> 45:48.953
Oh, I'm happy
if you enjoyed it.

45:48.953 --> 45:52.125
I think everyone did,

45:52.125 --> 45:54.093
Oh, my sister.

you mentioned Adolph Menzel?

46:02.436 --> 46:04.003
I do.

46:04.003 --> 46:06.305
I found the exhibition
of his work that I mentioned.

46:06.305 --> 46:09.775
It's at the Ross Gallery
on West 42nd.

we might go together.
