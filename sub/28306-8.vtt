00:01.235 --> 00:04.205
ANNOUNCER: In space,
no one can hear you sc--

00:04.238 --> 00:06.340
(all screaming)

00:06.374 --> 00:08.076
ANNOUNCER: Archer 1999.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.744
Premieres Wednesday, May 29
on FXX.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.849
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.884
[bats squeal]

00:18.018 --> 00:20.020
*

00:22.923 --> 00:26.260
NADJA:
I have given a strange girl
the most beautiful gift--

00:26.294 --> 00:28.096
the gift of becoming a vampiric

00:28.129 --> 00:31.065
bloodsucking creature
of the shadows.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.400
Did you see that?

00:32.433 --> 00:33.667
NADJA:
She has not yet blossomed

00:33.701 --> 00:36.537
into her full vampiric state,

00:36.570 --> 00:38.272
but I think she is on her way.

00:38.306 --> 00:41.675
(quietly): Oh, what the hell
is happening to me?

00:41.709 --> 00:43.177
(takes deep breath)

00:43.211 --> 00:44.578
JENNA:
Sorry if I don't

00:44.612 --> 00:47.181
seem up to my normal self.
I just...

00:47.215 --> 00:49.450
I've just been
going through changes.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.884
(hissing)

00:51.919 --> 00:53.621
Having crazy dreams.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.988
Like, super weird.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.960
My friends have noticed.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.030
(grunts)

01:03.063 --> 01:04.898
Mood swings.
Unusual cravings.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.735
-(creature squeals)
-(hisses)

01:07.768 --> 01:09.970
I'm usually a flexatarian.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.206
Who else?
Michelangelo Buonarroti.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.707
-(hissing)
-Michelangelo...

01:13.741 --> 01:15.609
JENNA:
I've developed
an eye sensitivity

01:15.643 --> 01:18.346
and skin sensitivity.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.049
-And sometimes...
-(whimpering)

01:22.082 --> 01:23.651
sometimes I have this urge

01:23.684 --> 01:26.086
to tear my roommate to shreds.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.256
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:28.289 --> 01:30.791
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:30.824 --> 01:33.261
* They have no use
for your song *

01:33.294 --> 01:35.963
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:35.996 --> 01:38.299
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:40.368 --> 01:43.437
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:43.471 --> 01:46.174
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:46.207 --> 01:48.576
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:48.609 --> 01:50.644
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

01:50.678 --> 01:54.182
*

02:00.721 --> 02:04.958
NANDOR: Thank you all for
coming to this house meeting.

02:04.992 --> 02:09.029
I must remind everyone that
if you are gonna entice a victim

02:09.062 --> 02:12.132
into the house
and then you let them live,

02:12.166 --> 02:13.301
show them out.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.702
-Loud and clear.
-Fair enough.

02:14.735 --> 02:15.869
-It's common courtesy.
-NADJA: All right. Yes.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.371
-It is.
-It is.
-Also,

02:17.405 --> 02:20.007
is it possible,
for when you leave the house,

02:20.040 --> 02:23.043
to blow out the candles?

02:23.076 --> 02:26.947
Observe. (blows)

02:26.980 --> 02:28.649
Simple as that.
Major catastrophe

02:28.682 --> 02:30.284
-averted.
-LASZLO: What is that

02:30.318 --> 02:32.286
disgusting, putrefied smell?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.555
Like a... snake in heat?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.023
That may be me.

02:36.056 --> 02:39.393
I'm wearing a new cologne called
"Mr. Hijinks."

02:39.427 --> 02:40.828
-NANDOR: Okay, great. I am...
-Aftershave?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.663
COLIN:
It's a cologne-aftershave mix

02:42.696 --> 02:45.333
-and I found it
in the bathroom at work.
-NANDOR: Eh, great.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.535
Can we just not talk about
the cologne anymore, please?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.036
-Why would you use a cologne?
-NANDOR: Shush!

02:49.069 --> 02:50.103
To annoy you.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.540
-TouchÃ©.
-NANDOR: Please,
I am speaking here!

02:52.573 --> 02:55.075
And when I was the leader
of my country,

02:55.108 --> 02:58.178
I would kill anyone
who disrespected me

02:58.212 --> 02:59.847
when I'm talking about candles.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.716
You were the leader
of a country?

03:02.750 --> 03:06.587
Yes. I was the leader
of Al Quolanudar.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.223
That sounds like
you just made it up.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.024
-COLIN: Sounds fake.
-No, I have not just made it up.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.693
It's a real country.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.362
It's not a fake country,
it's a real country.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.929
Al Quolanudar.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.698
-Bless you.
-NANDOR: Guillermo, go on your

03:17.731 --> 03:20.668
intelligent telephone machine
and l-look it up.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.702
GUILLERMO:
Spell that A...

03:21.735 --> 03:22.870
-A-L. New word.
-Uh-huh.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.505
-I've got it.
-NANDOR: Oh, great!

03:24.538 --> 03:26.206
Uh, how-how's it doing?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.842
Not so hot.
It's dissolved.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.580
-Wha... When did this happen?
-1401.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.848
(whimpers)

03:34.882 --> 03:36.517
NANDOR:
To find out that your country

03:36.550 --> 03:39.687
has not existed since 1401

03:39.720 --> 03:41.389
is a pretty sudden shock.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.392
It was my home.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.194
Yes, I was driven out
for pillaging

03:47.227 --> 03:50.298
and killing and torturing,

03:50.331 --> 03:53.401
and that's fair enough, really.
But now what do I have?

03:55.168 --> 03:58.005
Nowhere is my home.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.909
Aah!
(hissing)

04:01.942 --> 04:03.344
(sucks teeth)

04:03.377 --> 04:06.046
NADJA:
It is very disgusting for me to
see this little one like this.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.247
She is like a disabled,

04:07.281 --> 04:09.249
very sickly donkey

04:09.283 --> 04:12.252
that you want to smash
in the skull because it is just

04:12.286 --> 04:14.054
too pitiful to look at.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.456
Eh, I suppose I was not

04:15.489 --> 04:16.890
much different when I first
became a vampire.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.426
No one had had

04:18.459 --> 04:21.462
"the talk" with me
about my unholy transition.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.164
I had had no one to guide me.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.968
(hissing)

04:28.001 --> 04:29.803
(groans)

04:29.837 --> 04:32.272
This is a bag of soil
from my homeland

04:32.306 --> 04:33.941
that I take with me
when I travel.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.578
'Tis all that is left
of Al Quolanudar.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.113
Al Quolanudar!

04:40.147 --> 04:42.816
Al Quolanudar... Shit.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.623
(car alarm chirps)

04:49.657 --> 04:51.425
(growling)

04:51.459 --> 04:52.526
Oh, my God!

04:53.827 --> 04:54.995
Forget it.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.464
What?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.031
You are released.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.967
I'm not hungry.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.769
It's just...

05:01.802 --> 05:05.105
I just found out that my country
doesn't exist anymore

05:05.138 --> 05:06.940
and I'm really depressed
about it.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.642
And I've lost my appetite.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.344
You don't want to hear
about all this.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.780
-Y-You were running away.
-W...

05:12.813 --> 05:14.682
Are you okay?

05:14.715 --> 05:17.050
It's kind of you to ask,
but really, you go.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.152
Flee. Flee!

05:23.557 --> 05:24.892
Master, are you all right?

05:24.925 --> 05:28.829
I have no country.
I have no home.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.999
What? No, this is your home.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.901
And this is your country.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.504
No, it's not and it's not.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.272
Well, maybe you'd feel better
if you were an American citizen?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.010
-Is that possible?
-Of course.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.145
Yes.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.516
I will make an alliance
with this unholy nation

05:48.549 --> 05:50.984
and make this place my home!

05:51.018 --> 05:52.085
There you go.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.253
I think that's a bus stop there.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.288
I'll see you back at home.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
(squeaking)

06:00.728 --> 06:02.830
Yeah, it's become
pretty clear to me

06:02.863 --> 06:06.099
-that I'm turning
into a vampire.
-I bit your neck.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.902
I made you drink my blood.
What did you think I was doing?

06:08.936 --> 06:12.773
I don't know. I-I just didn't
think vampires existed and...

06:12.806 --> 06:16.710
(scoffs) You are giving me
sarcasm? (laughs)

06:16.744 --> 06:19.246
I-I enjoy.
(laughs)

06:19.279 --> 06:21.749
Am I gonna feel like crap
for all eternity?

06:21.782 --> 06:25.686
Darling, you feel like crap
because you are eating crap.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.255
You are living
like a little chimney boy.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.525
If you want to be a powerful,
strong vampire,

06:31.559 --> 06:33.961
you just have to complete
your transition.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.797
-How do I do that?
-Darling, it's nothing. You just

06:36.830 --> 06:39.232
got to drink
some human blood, baby.

06:39.266 --> 06:43.270
That's all. I am going
to teach you how to kill.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.305
Okay, is there any way I could
just drink their blood,

06:45.338 --> 06:47.775
-but not kill them?
-Shh.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.178
-You just shut up now,
my stupid little baby.
-Okay.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.249
GUILLERMO:
So I promised
to help my master

06:56.283 --> 06:59.052
-apply for citizenship.
-NANDOR: Yes?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.054
Ah, Guillermo. Excellent.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.457
I called Immigration, and

07:03.491 --> 07:06.159
you are eligible
for citizenship.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.561
-You actually
started the process,
-Great.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.129
but you didn't finish.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.163
I didn't?

07:10.197 --> 07:12.265
No. 1992.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.635
I did apply
for my American citizenship

07:14.668 --> 07:16.837
back in 1992.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.973
For five reasons
and five reasons only:

07:20.007 --> 07:24.778
Johnson, Jordan,
Bird, Barkley, Ewing.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.447
The starting lineup for the 1992

07:27.481 --> 07:31.418
U.S. Olympic
men's basketball team.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.487
-The Dream Team, baby.
-* I got the moves... *

07:33.521 --> 07:36.289
I call this my Dunk Zone.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.958
They were merciless.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.827
Titans amongst men.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.428
Conquerors of the court.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.830
I simply had to

07:42.863 --> 07:45.966
pledge my undying allegiance
to their nation.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.034
GUILLERMO:
Well, what happened in 1992?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.937
Why didn't you
complete the process?

07:49.970 --> 07:53.641
Probably because the Macarena
swept the nation.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.210
So... I didn't really have time
for anything else.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.113
Okay, every vampire has
their own special power.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.015
So, we need to work out
what yours is,

08:02.049 --> 08:05.352
so you can trap and kill
your first human meal.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.788
I can fold my tongue
like a taco.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.022
What's that? Oh, no.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.825
No. Let's try... You seduce me.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.661
I am just stupid human man.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.863
Oh, ouch, ouch, my balls.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.298
I'd love to drink beer.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.401
-Okay.
-Bite your lip seductively.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.303
(lip crunches)

08:23.336 --> 08:24.972
-Ow.
-Okay.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.241
Maybe seduction
isn't your special power.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.509
Well, what's your power?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.879
I am an excellent crawler.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.080
-You can see.
-Oh.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.720
(quietly):
Oh, she can do everything.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.889
Come on, try it. Maybe you're
a creepy crawler like me.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.224
Darling, it's very easy,

08:44.257 --> 08:46.359
you just scratch up the wall.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.329
That's right. Come on.
That's it. You're doing...

08:49.362 --> 08:51.932
(screams, grunts)

08:51.965 --> 08:53.667
-Oh, no, are you okay?
-(groans)

08:53.701 --> 08:55.268
What the hell is going on?

08:55.302 --> 08:58.238
What's all this mess
and what are you doing up there?

08:58.271 --> 09:00.574
Calm down, Laszlo. I was just
teaching the little stupid baby

09:00.608 --> 09:02.042
vampire how to crawl.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.343
-Who?
-Jenna.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.878
-Who's Jenna?
-She's right there.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.180
Oh, right, I didn't see you.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.548
She should be in a bloody cage.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.283
(gasps) Laszlo.
(hisses)

09:10.317 --> 09:12.686
-(both hissing)
-JENNA: That's a horrible
thing to say.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.288
Ah, see what you've done.
Ruined her confidence. (hisses)

09:15.322 --> 09:18.959
-(door slams)
-Damn.
-Idiot. (hisses)

09:18.992 --> 09:21.428
GUILLERMO:
Okay, just imagine we're at
the Immigration office

09:21.461 --> 09:22.963
and I'll be
the government official.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.598
When and where were you born?

09:24.632 --> 09:27.801
Al Quolanudar. Eh, 1262.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.036
And where is that?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.237
Southern Iran.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.571
Mm-hmm.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.273
Maybe not mention Iran.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.808
Why did you leave your country?

09:34.842 --> 09:38.311
Standard reasons.
Uh, driven out by peasants.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.581
How many times
have you been married?

09:41.615 --> 09:43.583
-Just the once.
-Okay.

09:43.617 --> 09:44.818
To 37 women.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.288
-(knocking)
-NADJA: Jenna,

09:48.321 --> 09:51.258
Laszlo is very sorry
and he has something to say.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.460
I say, little vampire,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.462
I'm very sorry for saying

09:55.495 --> 09:57.464
you should be kept in a cage.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.267
All of my knowledge
and the best of my abilities

10:00.300 --> 10:01.434
will turn you into

10:01.468 --> 10:05.238
the most impressive vampire
there is.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.674
(whispers):
Yes!

10:06.707 --> 10:08.642
Hello.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.511
-Really?
-Absolutely.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.013
Who is George Washington?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.514
-George Washington?
-Yes.

10:14.547 --> 10:18.585
America's first gay president.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.954
I don't think that George
Washington was actually...

10:20.988 --> 10:22.489
Yes.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.458
-Hello, Nandor!
-Hello.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.860
Is that that virgin girl?

10:26.894 --> 10:28.361
Hi.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.630
Is she a vampire now?

10:30.664 --> 10:33.366
Well, she's got fangs
and the white pale face--

10:33.400 --> 10:35.002
it's a pretty major clue.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.706
(sighs)
Anyway, which one is better:

10:38.739 --> 10:40.841
alt-right or Antifa?

10:40.874 --> 10:43.010
I'm trying to decide
which team to join...

10:43.043 --> 10:46.379
GUILLERMO:
I just, uh, found out
that Nadja has turned someone--

10:46.413 --> 10:48.816
someone so random,
it's crazy, like, it's crazy--

10:48.849 --> 10:51.318
into a vampire.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.687
(muffled shrieking)

10:53.721 --> 10:55.689
The transformation into a bat

10:55.723 --> 10:57.524
is probably
the most important thing

10:57.557 --> 10:59.526
-a vampire can do.
-NADJA: Yes.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.961
Do you have somewhere
that I could put my clothes?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.395
-No, no, no. Don't do that.
-Wait, what are you doing?

11:02.429 --> 11:05.665
If I'm gonna be a bat,
then don't I have to get...

11:05.699 --> 11:07.267
nak...
Where do my clothes go?

11:08.769 --> 11:09.970
Huh.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.238
Um...

11:11.271 --> 11:13.506
let's not get bogged down
in the details.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.675
-Keep your clothes on for now.
-Oh, okay.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.311
Right.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.080
When I turn into a bat,

11:20.113 --> 11:21.749
there's no real skill
to it at all.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.051
I just shout "bat!"

11:24.084 --> 11:25.919
(squeaking)

11:25.953 --> 11:27.520
Human form!

11:27.554 --> 11:29.689
-Much like that.
-Oh, wow.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.724
Your turn.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.259
Okay.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.493
(exhales)

11:33.526 --> 11:36.096
Bat!

11:36.129 --> 11:37.731
-(high-pitched screaming)
-Oh.
-Ooh.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.900
NADJA:
It's okay. Calm down
and just stop screaming.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.501
-Terrifying.
-What the heck?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.003
-What would you even call that?
-I don't know.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.838
"We, the people..."

11:44.872 --> 11:46.774
We, the people...

11:46.807 --> 11:48.608
-"We, the..."
-(loud thud)

11:48.641 --> 11:50.377
-JENNA: Ow!
-What was that?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.413
Sounded like someone threw
a bag of garbage off the roof.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.883
Well, go and investigate.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.522
Sorry, hi.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.758
-Yep. Bag of garbage.
-Uh, hi.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.927
Is there any way
you could let me back in?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.762
Yeah.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.099
(quietly):
You can figure it out
on your own

12:12.132 --> 12:13.733
since you're
a fucking vampire now.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.035
JENNA:
Guillermo?

12:15.068 --> 12:18.005
I can hear you.
Heightened senses.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.145
NADJA:
I just don't understand.
Turning into a bat

12:25.178 --> 12:27.647
is the easiest thing
for a vampire to do.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.818
I am not disappointed
with Jenna's progress so far.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.154
So, you know, maybe she
doesn't have a special power.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.489
So what?
She's a below-average vampire.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.491
Either way, I do think
she's very much ready

12:38.525 --> 12:40.093
for her first human meal.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.494
I believe in you very much.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.762
We're going to go to a party

12:42.796 --> 12:44.297
full of hot idiots.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.799
We demand you invite us

12:45.833 --> 12:48.268
inside your house carnival, now.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.070
Yeah, that's gonna be a "no."

12:50.103 --> 12:51.338
Ew.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.941
We will do whatever the hell
we want to do.

12:53.974 --> 12:57.911
And you will respect women
a lot more after this, okay?

12:57.945 --> 12:59.112
Okay.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.848
(dramatic music playing)

13:03.116 --> 13:05.252
NANDOR:
Obviously, I'm just going to

13:05.285 --> 13:09.189
hypnotize my interviewer
into giving me my citizenship.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.192
When was the last time you
traveled out of this country?

13:12.225 --> 13:13.827
Listen to my words.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.296
You will grant me

13:16.329 --> 13:19.032
my American citizenship.

13:19.066 --> 13:22.870
Make me one
with your evil empire.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.940
Is this a joke to you, sir?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.942
Um...

13:28.976 --> 13:30.577
No.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.447
-Good.
-NANDOR: It seems

13:34.481 --> 13:36.616
that, uh, government workers

13:36.649 --> 13:39.352
are immune to hypnotism.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.689
It's like their souls are dead
or something.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.292
Please describe
the right to bear arms.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.661
NANDOR:
If it's a nice day,

13:48.695 --> 13:52.565
you should have the right

13:52.599 --> 13:55.835
to bare your arms.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.538
All right.
Moving on.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.539
NANDOR (whispers):
I don't detect

13:59.572 --> 14:01.909
any human left in them.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.843
-(ska band playing)
-NADJA: Right. Who in here looks

14:03.877 --> 14:05.879
lovely, yummy-yummy,
tasty enough to eat?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.347
Oh, what about him?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.982
He looks like
a really good laugh.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.650
JENNA:
He's in my stats class.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.019
So?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.154
So, I-I cannot kill him

14:14.187 --> 14:16.389
because that would be
a very big blow to his family.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.591
I can't take that on,
emotionally.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.859
Please, darling, listen to me.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.429
We are in a room
full of pure asshole.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.197
You can do no wrong.
Honestly.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.034
I believe in you, my darling.
(exclaims)

14:27.067 --> 14:28.435
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.404
We elect a president
for how many years?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.740
A thousand years.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.047
Okay.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.714
The idea of self-government

14:41.748 --> 14:44.851
is in the first three words
of the Constitution.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.987
So, what are these words?

14:49.822 --> 14:50.890
Hmm?

14:50.924 --> 14:54.227
"Hey... you guys."

14:54.261 --> 14:55.929
Yeah. Okay.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.799
What does the Constitution
do for the people?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.434
-It...
-Oppresses them.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.139
Try and get his attention,
darling.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.807
Lovely red face.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.977
Are you enjoying your drink?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.612
Are you enjoying your drink?!

15:12.645 --> 15:14.881
-I don't think he hears me.
-No,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.816
I just think maybe
you're not trying hard enough.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.151
Just watch me, okay?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.087
Oh, hello.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.324
Oops, I'm... very sorry
for bumping into you.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.426
I will punish myself later,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.728
'cause I'm such a bad girl.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.130
Who are your parents?

15:30.163 --> 15:31.631
They are very bad

15:31.664 --> 15:35.602
for making such a big boy.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.304
I love you.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.805
So much.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.108
See? It's very, very easy.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.076
Just might want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.745
-I live to be your slave.
-Yes, yes. Now, go upstairs,

15:45.778 --> 15:48.015
put your head
deep inside the toilet bowl,

15:48.048 --> 15:50.183
and flush it seven times.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.454
I think-I think
that was an abuse of power.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.523
I think it's just
an abuse of that boy.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.125
-Oh, my...!
-(Nadja gasps)

15:58.158 --> 15:59.159
Hello.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.260
Hello?!

16:00.293 --> 16:01.494
Okay. No, it's okay.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.263
-He'll-he'll apologize.
-No.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.697
You have just spilled

16:04.731 --> 16:06.966
your tankard of mead
all over my companion.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.135
What? Who?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.202
Me.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.337
(hisses)

16:10.370 --> 16:12.205
(groans)
This is pointless!

16:12.239 --> 16:13.706
Nobody sees me!

16:13.740 --> 16:16.009
Why don't they see me?
This is pointless!

16:16.043 --> 16:17.510
No, darling, it's not pointless.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.946
No! I'm done! I'm done.
I've had it.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.348
-Thank you, I'm sorry.
-But...

16:21.381 --> 16:23.550
(Jenna exhales heavily)
Excuse me! Could you just...

16:23.583 --> 16:26.386
Can you just get out of my way?!

16:26.419 --> 16:27.954
Get out of my way!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.023
Why does nobody hear me?!

16:30.057 --> 16:31.824
(screams)

16:31.858 --> 16:33.126
(gasps)
Wh...

16:33.160 --> 16:35.328
-(woman gasps)
-(man grunts)

16:35.362 --> 16:37.564
-Whoa!
-What is that?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.067
-(partygoers scream)
-(Nadja laughs)

16:40.100 --> 16:41.334
Did you see?

16:41.368 --> 16:43.002
Did anyone... Really?!

16:43.036 --> 16:44.171
-Jenna?
-Whoa.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.039
You went invisible.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.508
The... Didn't you see it?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.644
You have a very,
very special power.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.048
You are going to murder so many
human people with this.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.053
-Yes.
-(small scream)

17:00.087 --> 17:01.554
(screams)

17:01.588 --> 17:03.156
JENNA:
This is the best
night of my life!

17:03.190 --> 17:04.591
-Okay, wait, wait, wait.
-NADJA: Where has she gone?

17:04.624 --> 17:07.094
Dracula's in the house!

17:07.127 --> 17:08.495
Where's my Jenna?

17:08.528 --> 17:09.662
There she is!

17:09.696 --> 17:11.564
-(squeals)
-This is amazing!

17:11.598 --> 17:15.068
I have a cool vampire power.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.204
Now, I wonder if anyone looks

17:17.237 --> 17:18.871
a little bit yummy-scrummy-bummy

17:18.905 --> 17:21.508
for you to murder with
your mouth right now, hey?

17:21.541 --> 17:22.909
-(playing ska music)
-* Pick it up *

17:22.942 --> 17:24.944
* Pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up *

17:24.977 --> 17:26.213
* Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up... *

17:26.246 --> 17:28.381
-(yells)
-(music stops, partygoers gasp)

17:28.415 --> 17:29.582
-(grunting)
-(Jenna grunts)

17:29.616 --> 17:31.050
MAN:
Pick him up!

17:31.084 --> 17:33.086
(grunting)

17:39.226 --> 17:41.228
(panting)

17:44.131 --> 17:46.533
-What the fuck?!
-Hi.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.967
Hey, there.
Um, no, it's okay.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.603
Aah!
(gasping)

17:50.637 --> 17:54.307
Ah...

17:59.612 --> 18:01.381
Hmm.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.217
Just need a little bit of...
little bit of chill.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.919
Okay, s-sorry.
Hold-hold still.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.489
Just gonna get the lid on
nice and tight and...

18:09.522 --> 18:12.125
on your blood, so it doesn't,
um, leak in my backpack.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.826
I've done as you asked,
Mistress.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.295
Not now, big boy.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.629
Go and eat some bricks.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.566
IMMIGRATION OFFICER:
Now,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.134
to test
your English comprehension,

18:21.168 --> 18:23.136
I'm going to ask you to recite

18:23.170 --> 18:24.637
the Oath of Allegiance.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.373
NANDOR:
Okay.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.309
"I hereby declare, on oath,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.744
"that I absolutely and entirely
renounce and abjure

18:31.778 --> 18:34.581
"all allegiance and fidelity
to any foreign prince

18:34.614 --> 18:36.616
"and without
any mental reservation

18:36.649 --> 18:40.353
"or purpose of evasion,
so help me G..."

18:43.856 --> 18:46.125
So help me G...

18:46.159 --> 18:48.628
(sighs)
So help me G...

18:48.661 --> 18:52.299
Could I possibly
just skip the last bit? Huh?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.470
So help me Go...
(screaming)

18:58.638 --> 19:00.307
-(flames hiss out)
-Oh...

19:00.340 --> 19:02.775
(muffled):
Ow. Ow.

19:02.809 --> 19:03.976
(groaning)

19:10.683 --> 19:13.386
You ready to go?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.288
I didn't pass.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.457
Made a fool out of myself.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.159
I have no country,
I have no home.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.329
I have no people.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.964
I'm like a little lost duck,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.200
floating about
in the middle of the ocean.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.236
Oh, will you stop fucking
complaining?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.539
-Excuse me?
-You know, I'm tired of it.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.474
So what? You're not
a fucking American citizen.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.975
You're not
a citizen of anything.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.577
You're a vampire!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.679
Okay? You can fly.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.681
You can transport
anywhere as a bat!

19:41.714 --> 19:42.915
You are immortal.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.418
Do you have any idea how much

19:45.452 --> 19:47.554
people would pay,
who they would kill

19:47.587 --> 19:49.155
just to be who you are?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.690
To be in your shoes?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.759
In your fucking shoes!

19:52.792 --> 19:55.595
You should be fucking proud
of yourself.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.730
Proud of who you are.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.733
Wow.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.034
Guillermo.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.438
You are right.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.707
I am a vampire.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.943
A cool and powerful vampire.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.683
Hear my words!

20:16.716 --> 20:20.420
I am a proud vampire!

20:20.453 --> 20:23.222
I will not bow down

20:23.256 --> 20:25.392
to your pathetic bureaucracies.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.895
It is you
who will bow down to me!

20:28.928 --> 20:31.631
I don't need your citizenship.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.065
I will rule

20:33.099 --> 20:35.868
this earth for eternity

20:35.902 --> 20:37.437
as you rot

20:37.470 --> 20:40.273
and your bones turn to dust!

20:40.307 --> 20:41.408
(car alarm blaring)

20:41.441 --> 20:42.975
Yes!

20:43.009 --> 20:45.445
Sound the alarms!

20:45.478 --> 20:48.715
It won't make no difference!

20:48.748 --> 20:50.750
(car alarm dies away)

20:52.184 --> 20:54.186
(Nandor exhales)

20:56.756 --> 20:59.592
Guillermo...

20:59.626 --> 21:03.430
I appreciate you telling me
how it is back there.

21:03.463 --> 21:07.266
Your tone was
highly disrespectful, but...

21:07.300 --> 21:09.469
you were right.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.670
Thank you.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.605
You're welcome.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.275
I guess now that you have
your, uh, confidence back,

21:16.309 --> 21:18.845
you probably need
some vampire sidekick to...

21:18.878 --> 21:20.246
Nah, I'm good.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.515
Oh.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.116
Hands down,
the best night of my life.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.319
-I mean, I'm invisible,
-Yes.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.154
I ate my first dude,

21:28.187 --> 21:30.457
and I've never
stayed up this late.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.024
Can we, like,
watch the sun rise or something?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.125
-That would be so nice.
-Oh...

21:33.159 --> 21:34.126
We could cozy up.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.128
About that-- um...

21:36.162 --> 21:37.764
Funny... very funny story.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.966
You can never
go in the sun again,

21:39.999 --> 21:41.634
because if you do, you will

21:41.668 --> 21:44.704
burst into a boiling ball
of flame.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.273
Sorry.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
I am a little disappointed
I didn't get to be

21:49.175 --> 21:50.843
a American citizen.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.680
I was really looking forward
to buying a gun.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.515
Oh, you don't need to be
a citizen to get a gun.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.983
They'll give those to anyone.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.885
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.654
Even in Al Quolanudar
you couldn't get a sword

22:01.688 --> 22:03.690
without the checking
of your background.

22:03.723 --> 22:04.891
JENNA:
I got it!

22:04.924 --> 22:07.293
NADJA:
What? What is it?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.662
Motorcycle helmets protect
vampires from the sun.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.730
Haven't you seen Blade?

22:10.763 --> 22:12.231
They put the things on

22:12.264 --> 22:14.401
and then the sun can't hit you.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.035
-Oh.
-Trust me.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.538
It's the night of many firsts,
for both of us.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.307
NADJA:
You are now a full,
strong vampire.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.075
You no longer need me.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.979
And thus, your never-ending
journey begins.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.382
-It's so exciting!
-JENNA: It is!

22:29.416 --> 22:31.418
-(hissing)
-NADJA: What the fuck?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.319
-JENNA: Ow!
-NADJA: Curse!

22:33.352 --> 22:34.353
Oh, that's very hot!

22:34.387 --> 22:37.724
-We must go!
-(squealing)

22:37.757 --> 22:39.659
*

22:39.692 --> 22:43.029

22:43.062 --> 22:45.932
* Raise up the soul,
pack up the school time *

22:45.965 --> 22:48.401
* Everybody knew that
she was ruler *

22:48.435 --> 22:50.870
* Wants to sink her fangs deep
in your neck *

22:50.903 --> 22:53.072
* She's gonna take you home
and show you no respect *

22:53.105 --> 22:55.074
* She's a vampire *

22:55.107 --> 22:56.476
* Shake it up *

22:58.310 --> 23:01.614
* Oh, vampire ska *

23:01.648 --> 23:04.350
* She said, "You dress
like a city gent" *

23:04.383 --> 23:07.186
* So out for a pint
is where we went *

23:07.219 --> 23:09.722
* Her bomber jacket
had a Guinness towel *

23:09.756 --> 23:11.758
* She looked real sharp
in my chrome cowl *

23:11.791 --> 23:14.761
* She's a vampire. *

with other vampires

23:26.105 --> 23:28.340
are the vampires
I have chosen to stay with.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.343
Last night, there were
all these people half-drunk.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.912
Well, where did they find
the alcohol?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.281
-No, they'd been half-drunk.
-Oh.

23:35.314 --> 23:39.452
Please, finish a whole victim
before moving on to a next one,
okay?

23:39.486 --> 23:42.321

caught in the door.
-Well, yank it out!
