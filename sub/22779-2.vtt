00:23.857 --> 00:26.609
[Charlotte]  "Since Mr. James Sloan
took over Quicksilver Mining,

00:26.693 --> 00:29.195
a beneficial change
has taken place in the mines.

00:31.406 --> 00:35.869
Industry, order, and respect
for the constituted authorities prevail.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.830
Every man knows his place
and performs his duty.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.465
Mr. Sloan is said to be fair,

00:48.548 --> 00:50.550
honest and good-humored.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.553
This reporter can also attest
that he is a tall man,

00:53.636 --> 00:56.056
rather handsome,
with a beautiful baritone.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.059
And if all that isn't enough,

00:59.142 --> 01:01.019
he writes the most beautiful poetry."

01:01.686 --> 01:02.729
Sonnets.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.606
Just like Shakespeare.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.443
Least you coulda done is put on a dress.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.258
[sighs]

01:33.092 --> 01:35.345
Well... it's not very often

01:35.428 --> 01:39.557
that a gentleman is greeted
by such a passel of fine-looking ladies.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.020
[chuckles] Now, which one of you
would be Mayor Cummings' charming widow?

01:44.521 --> 01:45.522
Mary-Agnes.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.275
And you're Mr. Sloan?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.277
No, ma'am, I'm J.J. Valentine,

01:51.361 --> 01:53.113
Mr. Sloan's humble number two...

01:53.613 --> 01:55.740
now made a surprised number one...

01:56.449 --> 01:58.076
by unfortunate circumstance.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.453
What happened to...

02:01.246 --> 02:02.956
What unfortunate circumstance?

02:04.290 --> 02:07.710
Mr. Sloan was murdered by vicious outlaws.

02:07.794 --> 02:08.837
[woman gasps]

02:08.920 --> 02:10.130
[baby grizzles]

02:10.213 --> 02:11.756
This is Mrs. Charlotte Temple.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.303
And Miss Callie Dunne.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.639
A divine pleasure, ladies.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
[chuckles]

02:21.975 --> 02:23.601
This here is Colonel Farnsworth,

02:23.685 --> 02:25.937
from the Colorado School of Mines.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.566
How do you do?

02:30.733 --> 02:31.734
Colonel?

02:32.610 --> 02:33.736
Of what, may I ask?

02:33.820 --> 02:34.821
[laughs]

02:34.904 --> 02:39.450
Whether Colonel Farnsworth came by his
title in any military manner is doubtful,

02:39.534 --> 02:42.245
but I assure you,
he is a real mining engineer.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.040
My new head of security, Mr. Logan.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.294
Ladies.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.262
[mutters] Oh, my God.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.431
[clears throat]

03:01.514 --> 03:02.599
Shall we go inside?

03:03.641 --> 03:05.643
How was your trip, Mr. Valentine?

03:05.727 --> 03:08.062
[Valentine] I always say, ma'am,
that a trip on the stage

03:08.146 --> 03:11.316
is something to look back upon
with pleasure in the afterlife.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.452
[instrumental theme music plays]

04:18.967 --> 04:21.636
[man] Now, how was it exactly
you came to realize

04:21.719 --> 04:24.180
that you were facing the vile Roy Goode?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.474
By descriptions I had read
in your newspaper.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.393
[grunts]

04:30.937 --> 04:32.563
That captures him exactly right.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.359
I saw him,
and with rather crushing vividness,

04:36.442 --> 04:41.197
the phrase, "No virtuous woman is safe
near Roy Good" came back to me.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.491
Well, that must have been
very frightening.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.951
Yes.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.161
But I made an act of contrition

04:47.245 --> 04:50.164
and I concentrated my thoughts
on the presence of God.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.792
Now, do you recall...

04:54.002 --> 04:57.213
was his pistol black-boned in the handle?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.715
[press clatters]

05:01.092 --> 05:02.302
[clears throat]

05:02.385 --> 05:03.803
[clattering stops]

05:06.055 --> 05:09.100
And did he carry it on his right
or on his left side?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.852
-His pistol?
-Mm.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.687
I really couldn't say.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.815
I was too busy
paying attention to the coffin.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.697
And you're sure it was a coffin?

05:22.780 --> 05:23.781
[coffin dragging]

05:23.865 --> 05:24.866
[nun]  Yes.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.954
For some time later, I saw him in
our church graveyard, digging up a grave.

05:32.957 --> 05:37.128
He took the bones from the dirt and he put
them into the casket he brought with him,

05:37.211 --> 05:38.254
then re-buried them.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.758
And what town did you say this was?

05:41.841 --> 05:42.925
Moses.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.971
Which, until then,
had always been such a tranquil place.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.514
Now, do you recall...

05:49.432 --> 05:52.143
the name on the grave that he dug up?

05:52.643 --> 05:54.103
There was no name,

05:54.187 --> 05:55.980
just a stick for a marker.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.565
But that weren't the worst part.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.650
[metallic clattering]

06:03.821 --> 06:05.198
[whispers] He took the clothes.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.328
He took the old rags from the dirt
and he put them on.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.421
[gasps]

06:21.839 --> 06:24.008
It was as if I had seen the devil himself.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.023
[woman] Good day to you, Sheriff.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.069
Who's your, uh...
Who's your prisoner, Sheriff?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.695
Never you mind, Sarah Doyle.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.031
OK.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.660
[children giggling]

06:51.244 --> 06:53.246
[women chattering]

06:56.415 --> 06:58.584
-Where are all the men at?
-[McNue] Dead.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.336
Mine took them.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.838
All of them?

07:02.296 --> 07:04.257
Anyone able worked underground.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.967
[children laughing]

07:10.012 --> 07:11.514
You understand, Sheriff...

07:12.265 --> 07:14.308
if word gets out Roy Goode's here...

07:15.226 --> 07:17.061
there's gonna be no stopping Frank.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.983
Well, you ain't gonna be here that long.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.032
Know why they call me Whitey Winn?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.118
It's because I always do.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.954
[chuckles]

07:35.580 --> 07:37.373
Now, you weren't expecting that, were you?

07:41.085 --> 07:42.086
Or that.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.921
[chuckles]

07:45.548 --> 07:46.632
All right.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.601
All right.

07:57.977 --> 07:58.978
Both of them.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.815
Jesus Christ, Whitey!

08:02.899 --> 08:04.525
Put the damn cannon away.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.195
When was the last time you bathed, son?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.238
A few days ago.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.699
You sure it wasn't longer than that?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.452
You're about as ripe
as a human body can get.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.663
A black coach come into town today...

08:18.206 --> 08:19.874
with a full escort of firepower.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.460
Yeah, I saw. Must be them mining folks.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.378
Where are the damn keys at?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.011
Do I know you?

08:32.094 --> 08:33.137
No, I don't think so.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.223
[Whitey] What's your name?

08:35.306 --> 08:36.974
Whitey Winn, this here's, uh...

08:40.311 --> 08:41.229
Mr. Ward.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.731
-Ward?
-Lock him up.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.025
All right? No visitors.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.652
Why? He dangerous?

08:47.735 --> 08:48.819
Just do it.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.863
What did he do? What'd you do?

08:51.447 --> 08:52.740
Robbed a stage.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.824
Really?

08:54.617 --> 08:55.451
Where?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.370
Up in Alamogordo.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.496
Just lock him up.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.289
I'm gonna go check on my children.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.793
Well, he don't look much like
the stage-robbing type.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.342
Looks more like
the pissing-in-public type to me.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.232
[bird calls]

09:33.281 --> 09:36.993
[Gatz] "Perhaps there is some decency
in Roy Goode after all...

09:38.035 --> 09:40.955
as he continues to thwart Frank Griffin

09:41.038 --> 09:43.416
and his gang at every turn...

09:44.208 --> 09:46.794
most recently in Creede, Colorado...

09:47.461 --> 09:51.674
where Mr. Goode intervened
in a payroll robbery at the Tomboy Mine."

09:51.757 --> 09:52.842
That's enough.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.226
I want you all to clean up
for town tomorrow.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.604
[Gatz] Where we going?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.315
Taos.

10:09.358 --> 10:13.112
We're gonna intervene
with this Mr. A.T. Grigg.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.243
Get the man next to some facts.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.390
[gasps]

10:41.849 --> 10:42.850
[gasps]

10:46.270 --> 10:47.688
[speaks in Paiute]

10:49.231 --> 10:50.983
[speaks in Paiute]

10:55.863 --> 10:56.864
Mama?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.200
You all right?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.078
[Iyovi speaks in Paiute]

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
[Iyovi speaks in Paiute]

11:11.420 --> 11:12.421
[sighs]

11:12.963 --> 11:14.965
[panting]

11:38.739 --> 11:40.157
[horse whinnies in distance]

12:19.113 --> 12:20.489
[chattering]

12:20.573 --> 12:24.034
Such a fine meal would have done honor
to the best hotel in New York.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.494
Well, thank you.

12:27.997 --> 12:28.998
Good taste...

12:30.124 --> 12:31.125
good order...

12:31.834 --> 12:34.587
handsome children and domestic happiness

12:34.670 --> 12:36.505
are the necessary consequence...

12:37.214 --> 12:39.508
even in a wild place such as this.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.135
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

12:41.969 --> 12:42.970
Hear, hear.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.892
Miss Dunne...

12:48.642 --> 12:51.103
I don't believe I ever had me
a marm as pretty as you are.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.980
Thank you, sir.

12:53.063 --> 12:56.275
But may I ask, have you always had
a fondness for teaching children?

12:56.775 --> 12:59.153
No, sir. I'd always been a whore.

12:59.653 --> 13:03.032
I just sort of fell into teaching
after Magdalena's closed.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.660
Then the schoolhouse
got struck by lightning and burned down.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.162
Took the old marm with it.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.248
I see.

13:11.916 --> 13:12.958
[clears throat]

13:13.042 --> 13:14.585
So, tell me, Mrs. Cummings--

13:14.668 --> 13:16.170
-[Mary-Agnes] McNue.
-Excuse me?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.506
I've returned to my maiden surname.

13:20.716 --> 13:24.553
Albert's dead. No reason for me to keep
carrying his name like a bucket of water.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.556
He's got a brother in Missouri for that.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.268
How independent of you. [chuckles]

13:32.895 --> 13:35.606
So, tell me, Miss McNue,

13:35.689 --> 13:38.609
how has the lovely town of La Belle fared
these past two years

13:38.692 --> 13:39.860
without any men around?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.279
We've done all right.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.531
[Charlotte chuckles]

13:44.490 --> 13:45.366
Well...

13:47.326 --> 13:48.327
It's...

13:48.869 --> 13:50.412
It's been difficult. [chuckles]

13:52.039 --> 13:53.415
It's been quite difficult.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.418
As you can well imagine,
a town full of ladies...

13:56.919 --> 13:58.587
is ripe fruit for the wicked.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.882
It seems that, since the accident,

14:01.966 --> 14:04.718
everyone who's come through town
has tried to take advantage.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.053
[Valentine] Mm.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.558
Well, we at Quicksilver
aim to help you ladies all we can.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.603
You've got a mine with some value to it,
and I got the men to work it.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.232
But first,
before we strike any kind of deal...

14:18.983 --> 14:22.695
we need to determine
how much value there actually is.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.613
Colonel Farnsworth.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.243
Suppose you educate us
about the mine here at La Belle.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.160
Of course.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.204
[door opening]

14:34.665 --> 14:35.666
[horse whinnies]

14:35.749 --> 14:37.626
[Logan] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

14:37.710 --> 14:38.544
Goddamn it!

14:38.627 --> 14:40.087
Goddamn it!

14:40.170 --> 14:41.505
What are you doing?

14:41.589 --> 14:44.258
Goddamn! What are you doing?
Come here. Come here.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.634
[horse whinnies]

14:45.718 --> 14:46.719
Get over here.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.345
Get up there.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.308
[door opening]

14:58.814 --> 14:59.815
[Whitey] So, is it true?

15:00.941 --> 15:02.610
Alice Fletcher really shot you?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.362
Because I-I wouldn't doubt it...

15:05.863 --> 15:09.116
seeing as the woman was a widow twice
before she was even 21.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.619
First one died in a flash flood,

15:11.702 --> 15:13.704
and then, uh, she disappeared for a bit.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.916
I don't know, six years later,

15:16.999 --> 15:18.584
she shows back up on the ranch

15:18.667 --> 15:21.670
with a child and some Paiute husband,

15:21.754 --> 15:24.173
claiming that the property
was still rightfully hers.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.302
The trouble is,
Asa Leopold, the drygoodsman...

15:28.385 --> 15:29.386
[door closing]

15:29.470 --> 15:32.932
...him and his sons, they was squatting
the land while she was gone.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.393
They claimed
they paid a $200 relinquishment,

15:36.477 --> 15:38.062
and so the land was theirs.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.147
What happened?

15:41.982 --> 15:45.277
Well, Sheriff McNue,
he got into it with the Leopolds.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.697
Told them Alice's deed was still good
and they had to vacate.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.824
Got into it how?

15:51.325 --> 15:53.285
Well, the Leopolds was waiting for Bill

15:53.369 --> 15:56.372
when he went to the ranch to show them
the deed, and they bushwhacked him.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.792
Bill took a bullet in the hip,
but still managed to get up, shoot,

15:59.875 --> 16:01.627
and killed all three of Asa's boys.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.673
The same sheriff who brought me in?
He shot all three?

16:05.756 --> 16:08.133
Yes, sir.
He didn't monkey around none, either.

16:08.217 --> 16:12.054
He just walked right up whilst they was
all still shooting and put them all down.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.389
[mimics gunshots]

16:13.472 --> 16:14.473
[chuckles]

16:15.099 --> 16:17.184
There was a time
when Bill was quite the gun.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.812
He taught me everything I know.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.860
So, um... Alice and her family
moved into the property,

16:26.944 --> 16:28.570
and then, one day...

16:29.905 --> 16:32.825
her husband winds up dead
on the street, shot in the back.

16:34.952 --> 16:35.953
The old man?

16:37.204 --> 16:38.747
Well, nobody knows.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.583
Don't matter, though.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.670
Two weeks later,
Asa's wife dies of rheumatic fever, so...

16:45.337 --> 16:46.964
[Roy sighs]

16:48.173 --> 16:51.885
The folks around here, they like to say
that Alice and the old Indian woman

16:51.969 --> 16:54.513
conjured up a spell
that brung all the bad luck.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.809
I just say
it goes to show that, eventually,

16:58.892 --> 17:01.186
we, all of us, gonna find the dirt,
one way or another.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.857
The chloride ores reach from the surface

17:04.940 --> 17:06.650
to a depth of 60 or 70 feet.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.862
Then comes a barren streak,

17:09.945 --> 17:12.531
extending down 20 to 30 feet

17:12.614 --> 17:13.949
to the water level.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.286
It's this unproductive stratum

17:17.369 --> 17:20.205
that makes your mine not as...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.167
fertile as it might be.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.670
That's true, Colonel,
but you go below the water level...

17:27.463 --> 17:29.590
you'll see that the vein remains unbroken.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.469
We believe it'll keep its promise
for as far down as you can dig.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.266
It's our feeling, Miss McNue...

17:40.225 --> 17:42.227
that the lode
is far more ordinary than that.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.980
That perhaps, in the very beginning...

17:45.564 --> 17:48.192
it was salted
to make the deposit look richer.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.697
Now, you should know there have always
been rumors to that effect.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.576
Mr. Valentine, La Belle is no "ordinary
lode," but a goddamn mountain of quartz.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.078
You know it and I know it,

17:59.161 --> 18:02.206
and I would wager that there drunk pinhead
you brung with you knows it, too.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.582
Mary-Agnes--

18:03.665 --> 18:05.501
But if you don't want to talk sensibly,

18:05.584 --> 18:07.419
there's plenty of other outfits
we can go to.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.504
Mr. Valentine...

18:10.214 --> 18:11.215
we do want your help.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.093
[chuckles] We really do.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.763
-We need you.
-We're not gonna give it away, either.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.431
[Valentine] Give what away, exactly?

18:21.225 --> 18:23.644
Do you ladies know what they say
about La Belle?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.898
That it's more a place of note
than importance.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.443
A place of many houses...

18:32.402 --> 18:33.904
but few souls to live in them.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.531
As you well know,

18:36.156 --> 18:38.742
those houses were all full
not that long ago.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.120
Well, actually, Miss McNue, I don't know.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.997
The railroad
is closer to Lordsburg than here.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.457
So, to my way of seeing,

18:45.541 --> 18:48.460
they had already robbed you
of your population before the accident.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.712
We got enough ore here to bury Lordsburg.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.797
So you say.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.008
Yet your deepest shaft is, what, 86 feet?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.427
We have one finished
that goes down 103 feet,

18:57.511 --> 19:00.013
and another just about so
that goes down 160.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.601
Before the men died, we had plans to build
a 40-stamp mill and a 30-ton smelter

19:04.685 --> 19:06.812
to keep up with all the ore
they were pulling out.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.606
We know how to run the mine.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.526
We want to be partners.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.613
Fifty-fifty.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.828
[man] I spit more than you pour
in this place.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.121
[piano playing]

19:28.500 --> 19:29.501
Tickets?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.880
Where'd these other boys come from?

19:33.213 --> 19:36.383
One of them cattle outfits.
They come through now and again.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.094
Less and less
since we lost the whorehouse.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.226
[barman] Eighty-three good men...

19:46.643 --> 19:47.644
gone...

19:48.312 --> 19:49.771
in less than five minutes.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.856
Tragic.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.942
Let me ask you something, ladies.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.572
What's the strongest building
in this town?

19:59.072 --> 20:00.490
Well, that's easy. It's this one.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.701
What makes it so strong?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.870
It's built of iron and brick.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.164
My husband Theo insisted on it.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.666
And iron and brick comes from where?

20:10.876 --> 20:11.710
The East.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.672
Rifles, nails, gunpowder,

20:15.756 --> 20:18.050
flour, coffee, ammunition,

20:18.133 --> 20:20.510
all of it comes from the East.

20:21.678 --> 20:25.140
Quicksilver Mining
has been based in Pittsburgh for 22 years.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.600
If you allow us,

20:26.683 --> 20:28.602
we'll build your whole town

20:28.685 --> 20:30.145
out of iron and brick.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.359
Metaphorically speaking, of course.

20:35.442 --> 20:36.443
[chuckling]

20:36.944 --> 20:39.238
In a month's time,
I can have 50 good men here.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.906
A hundred the month after that.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.158
A hundred and fifty men...

20:43.951 --> 20:46.536
all here to work hard

20:46.620 --> 20:49.164
and take care of all of you.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.044
[Sarah] Well...

20:54.962 --> 20:56.380
that sounds real nice.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.592
Oh, I'm sure by now
you ladies have all got to be nostalgic

21:00.676 --> 21:01.802
for the scent of a man.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.389
A real man.

21:08.892 --> 21:13.230
Now, Quicksilver will take just 90%
of the claim and bear 100% of the costs.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.190
Maybe you didn't hear me before.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.193
-We want half.
-I heard you, Miss McNue.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.988
While you may possess
a working knowledge of the mine,

21:21.071 --> 21:24.533
you are naive when it comes
to the business of running it.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.576
Certainly not on your own.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.205
I think you, sir, are naive when it comes
to understanding what we all been through,

21:30.289 --> 21:33.000
and just how changed we are
on the other side.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.501
Some of you more than others.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.884
[chair bangs]

21:47.139 --> 21:49.891
There was nothing but a dozen tents
when Albert and I got here.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.437
One was a saloon,
another was a whorehouse.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.148
You remember that.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.776
So do you.

22:00.861 --> 22:01.903
So do all of you.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.824
We built this place together.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.495
We gave up our old lives
to build something new.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.080
Yes.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.500
But then we lost everything.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.211
We lost our husbands and a few horses.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.296
We're still here.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.964
Your children are still here.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.299
The silver's still here.

22:22.382 --> 22:25.927
And it's still our goddamn silver,
and that means we still got choices.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.972
Mister, we're a lot fucking stronger
than you think we are.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.307
I'm sure that's so,

22:30.390 --> 22:32.976
but they say
it takes a mine to work a mine.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.145
You don't have the capital.
You don't have the men.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.106
-We'll go to the Paiutes.
-[chuckles] You can't be serious!

22:38.190 --> 22:39.316
[man] I could work it.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.693
[Valentine] Who might you be, sir?

22:42.319 --> 22:44.613
Um... That's... That's John Doe.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.406
-John Doe?
-What's all this, then?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.616
[Charlotte] Yes, he, um...

22:48.158 --> 22:50.285
He was the only man
to survive the accident.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.870
Doesn't anybody know his name?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.497
It was his first day on the job,

22:53.580 --> 22:56.416
so I suspect that the foreman
knew his name, but he's...

22:57.125 --> 22:58.126
he's no longer with us.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.878
I can... I can work the mine.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.547
-Come on, baby, let's get you home.
-I can work it.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.091
[Sadie] I know, honey, I know.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.842
[John Doe] Please. Please!

23:05.926 --> 23:06.843
[door opening]

23:06.927 --> 23:07.928
[John Doe grunts]

23:09.471 --> 23:12.224
Well, a few dozen more like him
and your troubles are over.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.107
[Valentine clears throat]

23:25.529 --> 23:27.114
That's a cashier's check...

23:27.781 --> 23:29.407
for $20,000.

23:33.745 --> 23:38.333
And I will give you the time it takes
for me to put on my hat and my coat

23:38.416 --> 23:41.962
to decide whether you and your lovely town

23:42.045 --> 23:44.005
want the money and the men...

23:44.923 --> 23:45.924
or not.

23:57.310 --> 23:58.937
[Valentine hums tune]

24:00.522 --> 24:02.941
-Ladies, we deserve--
-Sarah.

24:04.442 --> 24:05.861
We deserve this.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.155
[continues humming]

24:14.286 --> 24:15.370
[stops humming]

24:15.453 --> 24:16.705
I suggest you put it to a vote.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.624
[resumes humming]

24:33.930 --> 24:35.098
I say we take the deal.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.104
Me, too.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.317
[whispers] I'm sorry.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.784
[Valentine] A wise decision, ladies.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.583
[chair creaking]

26:15.073 --> 26:16.199
You know what I want?

26:17.951 --> 26:19.869
A million dollars, I suppose?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.375
A little curly-headed girl.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.255
Well...

26:32.090 --> 26:33.675
I'll do the best that I can.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.388
[chuckles]

26:52.902 --> 26:54.321
[gunshot]

26:55.530 --> 26:57.032
[footsteps]

26:57.115 --> 26:59.200
Pa, I heard a gunshot.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.495
That you did, son.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.504
Mind your sister until I get back.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.511
[men whooping, gunfire]

27:18.595 --> 27:20.221
[women shrieking]

27:23.308 --> 27:24.351
[horse whinnies]

27:24.434 --> 27:26.436
[gunfire and whooping continues]

27:32.400 --> 27:35.695
[cowboy] We're wild wolves, and we're
gonna kill any man who carries a weapon!

27:36.488 --> 27:37.781
[gunfire continues]

27:37.864 --> 27:38.865
[horse whinnies]

27:38.948 --> 27:40.033
[whistling]

27:41.618 --> 27:42.619
[whistling]

27:43.161 --> 27:44.329
[McNue] Evening, fellas.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.538
What can I do for ya?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.749
We came here to see Magdalena.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.626
[McNue]
She cleared out of here months ago.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.796
Now, I'm sorry
you rode all this way for nothing,

27:52.879 --> 27:54.839
but I have to ask you boys
to ride on out of here.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.425
[cowboy] Or else what?

27:58.176 --> 27:59.344
[McNue] Or else what?

27:59.928 --> 28:02.222
Don't be like that.
There are women out here.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.517
[groans]

28:05.600 --> 28:07.227
Well, I'd best get on out there.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.193
[McNue] Come on, boys.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.112
I know you don't want no trouble.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.365
You ain't gonna be no trouble.
No trouble at all.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.325
Now, you listen...

28:23.451 --> 28:24.452
[cowboys laugh]

28:27.288 --> 28:28.581
[laughter continues]

28:28.665 --> 28:29.499
[McNue] Boys...

28:33.169 --> 28:34.254
Hey.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.424
[onlookers gasp]

28:39.175 --> 28:41.052
You shot me in the damn shoulder, boy!

28:41.136 --> 28:42.470
Name's not "boy."

28:43.263 --> 28:44.431
It's Whitey Winn.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.933
[cowboy groans]

28:47.016 --> 28:48.893
Next one spoils your face.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.272
Now, I think y'all heard the sheriff.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.315
-Yes, sir.
-[Whitey] I suggest you get.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.109
[cowboy] Come on.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.120
You all right there, Sheriff?

29:09.372 --> 29:10.790
[onlookers murmuring]

29:16.671 --> 29:17.922
Now, don't worry, folks.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.508
Ain't none of them gonna bother you again.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.683
[Whitey] All right, come on.
Let's go back inside.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.185
[murmuring]

29:34.898 --> 29:36.441
Well, well...

29:55.043 --> 29:56.669
[laughter in distance]

30:10.850 --> 30:11.851
Did you enjoy that?

30:15.980 --> 30:18.358
I... I suppose you'd have shot them two.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.445
Either way,

30:22.529 --> 30:25.990
I'm sure you think I'm a coward,
just like everyone else around here.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.619
I don't judge another man
unless I've walked in his shoes.

30:32.705 --> 30:34.666
What's the matter with your eyes?

30:36.251 --> 30:38.378
I had a horse once, lost his sight.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.964
He had the same heedful walk you do.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.218
I've been losing it...

30:46.761 --> 30:49.264
bit by bit since my wife died
a few years ago

30:49.347 --> 30:50.974
giving birth to my daughter.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.186
Hell... the way things are going,

30:55.270 --> 30:56.437
I figure I've got...

30:57.230 --> 31:00.108
maybe another six months
before I go completely blind.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.737
I'm sorry.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.576
I don't need your pity.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.923
Why don't you tell me about Frank Griffin?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.468
Where do you figure he's hiding?

31:28.469 --> 31:30.346
Frank ain't hiding, Sheriff.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.183
He's out there spilling blood
from hell to breakfast,

31:34.267 --> 31:35.894
trying to make me feel bad.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.645
For what? Stealing from him?

31:37.729 --> 31:38.855
Leaving him.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.357
He always thought of me as kin.

31:42.483 --> 31:45.153
Well, Frank don't like it much
when kin abandons him.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.155
Why did you abandon him?

31:47.238 --> 31:49.741
It ain't so simple, Sheriff.
It's personal.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.868
Not after a whole town
gets lynched it ain't.

31:51.951 --> 31:53.369
I tried to stop that.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.621
But you didn't.

31:57.790 --> 31:59.125
No, sir, I didn't.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.800
Griffin will probably go back up
to that canyon where you shot him...

32:09.010 --> 32:10.470
try and pick up your trail.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.347
He more than likely did just that.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.516
Which means you more than likely
just led the man right here.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.811
He ain't ever finding me, Sheriff.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.650
A man alone can be invisible
if he knows what he's doing.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.319
Griffin's riding with 30.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.574
Thirty men wouldn't at all be invisible,
now, would they?

32:33.785 --> 32:34.994
No, sir, they would not.

32:36.245 --> 32:39.374
So, if someone rode up
to Doubtful Canyon...

32:41.125 --> 32:44.045
they ought to be able to pick up
on his trail without too much trouble.

32:46.923 --> 32:47.924
Sure.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.888
If that "someone" had proper eyesight.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.435
I ain't blind yet.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.561
Mr. Griffin.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.441
I'm a big admirer of your work.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.652
I just wish it was more accurate.

33:52.071 --> 33:55.324
The way it sounds in your paper,
Roy Goode's making a fool of me.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.285
Well...

33:58.036 --> 33:59.579
he did best you at Creede.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.458
From the sweet end of a rifle.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.046
Are you crying, sir?

34:08.671 --> 34:09.672
No.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.799
It's just... my eye.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.302
Old war wound.

34:15.803 --> 34:16.888
You fought in what war?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.265
I fought my wife.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.517
May she rest in peace.

34:22.435 --> 34:26.773
And on the last occasion, she broke
a bottle of liniment across my cheek.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.158
That's true.

34:39.994 --> 34:40.870
[laughter stops]

34:40.953 --> 34:42.997
Now, what is it I can do
f-for you gentlemen?

34:43.456 --> 34:46.501
Well, let's just say
you're gonna give me immortality,

34:46.584 --> 34:48.961
and I'm gonna let you live longer
than you might have.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.132
I want you to write me a story,

34:53.216 --> 34:54.801
only as I prescribe it to you.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.638
Well, I'm sorry, I'm not for hire.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.100
I print the truth only as I see it.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.392
Could have fooled me.

35:03.476 --> 35:07.021
Hell,  The Daily Review  don't even come out
but once a week. That's a lie right there.

35:07.105 --> 35:07.939
[Grigg chuckles]

35:08.022 --> 35:10.066
I print the news of the day.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.276
Well, sir, the news of today is...

35:12.985 --> 35:16.906
that the crybaby editor
of  The Daily Review  was found this evening

35:16.989 --> 35:19.200
in a puddle of his own piss and brains.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.288
[chuckles]

35:28.334 --> 35:29.460
You're Gatz Brown.

Amos Green.

35:33.756 --> 35:34.590
[chuckles]

35:37.135 --> 35:38.427
And that's Alonzo Bunker.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.013
There's Floyd Wilson.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.475
Bill Chick.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.647
And Dyer Howe, of course.

35:51.774 --> 35:52.859
Mr. Ledbetter.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.319

35:56.070 --> 35:58.698
And the naughty... the naughty Devlins.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.408
[chuckles]

36:03.744 --> 36:06.205
I want you to write
that Roy Goode betrayed me...

36:07.290 --> 36:10.501
and that I will kill any man,
woman or child who harbors him.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.547
The good people of Creede
let him walk their streets and...

36:15.381 --> 36:16.966
now they don't have no streets.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.261
Or people... for that matter.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.977
[horses whinnying]

36:29.645 --> 36:31.522
[Truckee] Are you sure
you know how to do this?

36:31.606 --> 36:33.733
I watched your father do it lots of times.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.235
There's watching and there's doing.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.239
Too bad Roy ain't here.

36:40.865 --> 36:41.866
"Isn't" here.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.868

Hi, William.

Trudy.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.390
Is, uh...

38:29.473 --> 38:31.183
Is my sister about?

38:31.267 --> 38:33.978
She's out yonder,
trying to shoot some quail for breakfast.

38:34.478 --> 38:35.479
All right.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.523
[Callie] Oh! I'm sorry.

38:38.524 --> 38:40.901
How's that spelling coming, William?

38:41.694 --> 38:42.945
Just fine, Miss Dunne.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.072
You want to tell me what Callie Dunne's
doing over at your place?

39:27.365 --> 39:29.283
I assume her morning toilette.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.619
Jesus, Maggie.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.706
I get lonely same as you, Bill.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.671
Where are you running to this time?

39:42.755 --> 39:44.382
I ain't running nowhere.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.551
I'm gonna help Marshal Cook
bring in Frank Griffin.

39:47.927 --> 39:48.928
[scoffs]

39:49.011 --> 39:50.596
Don't you look at me like that.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.265
I've been known to kill a man or two.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.017
So has lightning.

39:55.101 --> 39:59.188
Well, I'm gonna see if I can't do
one last thing right as a lawman...

40:00.147 --> 40:02.566
before the whole damn world
goes dark on me.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.407
[shell loads]

40:10.241 --> 40:12.076
Are my children
gonna be all right with you?

40:12.159 --> 40:13.327
Why wouldn't they be?

40:13.828 --> 40:14.829
Look at you.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.415
You know, you ain't the same.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.668
What's different about me?

40:22.586 --> 40:23.671
Well...

40:24.588 --> 40:26.132
you're not maternal no more.

40:26.799 --> 40:27.633
Maternal?

40:27.716 --> 40:28.801
Well, yeah.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.972
Bill, I loved my husband,
may he rest in peace,

40:33.055 --> 40:34.765
and I love William and Trudy, too.

40:35.474 --> 40:38.227
But I'm done with the notion
that the bliss of me and my sisters

40:38.310 --> 40:40.354
is to be found in childbearing
and caregiving.

40:42.356 --> 40:43.899
I'm gonna go say my goodbyes.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.236
You best make it a good one.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.354
Pass me my damn rifle.

41:30.446 --> 41:32.615
You know, it's interesting
how the women around here

41:32.698 --> 41:35.367
all seem to believe
that a man's emotions ebb and flow

41:35.451 --> 41:37.495
right along with his digestive juices.

41:40.706 --> 41:41.707
Where you going?

41:43.167 --> 41:44.668
I'm gonna bring in Frank Griffin.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.177
Well, stop sitting there
with your mouth open like a flytrap

41:53.260 --> 41:54.929
and pass me a box of them shells.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.390
Now, hold on.
Shouldn't I at least go with you?

41:58.474 --> 41:59.558
No, you should not.

Marshal Cook's on his way up to Olegrande
to fetch the army.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.734
Once I pick up on Griffin's trail,
I'll meet up with them and...

42:10.069 --> 42:11.529
we'll go after him together.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.328
I think you're already full, Sheriff.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.377
In the meantime...

42:27.670 --> 42:30.130
you keep an eye on Mr. Ward here
until we get back.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.049
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.

42:32.716 --> 42:33.968
All right.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.761
I'll be a week or two at the most.

You going somewhere?

44:39.760 --> 44:42.179
The rest of your herd's
up in the hills by the creek.

44:42.262 --> 44:44.223
Whitey and Hiram
will help you fetch them all.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.771
Why don't you come inside, Bill?
Have a cup of coffee.

44:53.315 --> 44:54.400
I'd better not.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.820
I won't be in your road no more, Alice.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.447

Oh, no. Sheriff said Mr. Ward
ain't supposed to have any visitors.

Mister who?

You can leave any baked goods you might
have brung with me, though. That's all.

50:10.966 --> 50:11.967
Come on.

50:13.385 --> 50:14.386
[grunts] Here.

50:15.178 --> 50:16.680
Up, up.

50:16.763 --> 50:18.515
There you go. There.

50:18.598 --> 50:19.766
That leg over there.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.102
What did you folks say your names were?

50:22.769 --> 50:24.187
I'm Nicholas Gustavson.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.272
[Frank grunts]

50:25.814 --> 50:27.357
And this is my brother, Jacob.

50:28.650 --> 50:31.069
-Where are you all from?
-Norway.

50:32.904 --> 50:36.283
Well, I admire you making
the journey west. It's a hard run.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.161
I know. I done it.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.290
I came out West on a wagon train
from Arkansas.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.709
I was just a boy.

50:46.835 --> 50:48.336
Not much more than your age.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.421
[chuckles]

50:50.881 --> 50:54.718
The trip was going just fine until we all
came to a little knot in the road in Utah.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.512
A place called Mountain Meadows.

50:58.972 --> 51:02.559
See, my mammy and pappy
and almost everybody else were all killed.

51:03.101 --> 51:05.187
By Indians... it looked like.

51:05.771 --> 51:08.190
Except when these Indians
washed their faces,

51:08.273 --> 51:09.483
their skin was white.

51:11.193 --> 51:13.445
Turns out they all came from
the Great Salt Lake.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.990
"Men of religion," they said.

51:17.073 --> 51:17.908
[scoffs]

51:17.991 --> 51:20.118
Well, some of these religious men...

51:21.661 --> 51:24.623
applied themselves to my sister
before they killed her.

51:26.958 --> 51:30.003
Got their pretend war paint
all over her real skin.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.716
My baby brother, Liam,
wouldn't stop fussing

51:34.800 --> 51:36.718
while they was raping
and killing my family,

51:36.802 --> 51:38.970
so they grabbed him by the feet and...

51:39.805 --> 51:41.598
smashed his head on a wagon wheel.

51:43.892 --> 51:45.018
Like that one there.

51:49.356 --> 51:51.399
They killed over 100 people that day...

51:53.151 --> 51:54.903
including my mammy and pappy and...

51:55.612 --> 51:56.780
Liam,

51:56.863 --> 51:58.365
older sister, Lorie...

51:59.199 --> 52:01.952
my aunt and uncle
and their little girl, cousin Phoebe.

52:03.578 --> 52:06.581
One of them,
Mr. Isaac Haight, was all the time...

52:07.290 --> 52:09.835
preaching to the men
doing the killing how...

52:10.877 --> 52:13.255
about how all things
are purified with blood.

52:13.922 --> 52:16.883
How without the shedding of blood,
there is no remission.

52:18.260 --> 52:21.638
He said how they was giving us all
eternal salvation,

52:21.721 --> 52:23.682
spilling our gentile blood in the dirt.

52:25.475 --> 52:28.478
I heard him say how killing gentiles
was a means of grace...

52:29.145 --> 52:30.689
and a virtuous deed.

52:33.149 --> 52:34.568
And I thought to myself...

52:35.777 --> 52:36.778
"Hm."

52:39.072 --> 52:41.074
Well, after he saved my family,

52:41.157 --> 52:44.911
Mr. Isaac Haight became my new pappy,
and one of his wives my new mammy.

52:45.704 --> 52:48.540
My family, like all of the families
we was traveling with,

52:48.623 --> 52:51.459
had a considerable amount of gold
and personal property,

52:51.543 --> 52:53.837
all of which my new family
took right good care of.

52:54.379 --> 52:57.674
Mr. Haight gained ten pounds just so he
could fit into my old pappy's clothes.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.177
I remember seeing one of his 14 wives

53:01.261 --> 53:03.471
wearing one of my mammy's skirts
in church.

53:05.640 --> 53:08.435
But the image I have of my family

53:08.518 --> 53:11.605
is looking back at them
as Mr. Haight took us away.

53:14.733 --> 53:16.443
Their bodies left to...

53:18.653 --> 53:21.364
fester and corrupt in the hot sun.

53:25.327 --> 53:26.912
I learned to love Mr. Haight.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.666
He taught me with the stick

53:31.750 --> 53:34.169
and the bullwhip and the knife
how to love.

53:37.172 --> 53:39.382
Same as I love Roy Goode now.

53:41.801 --> 53:43.303
For he's my son.

53:44.638 --> 53:45.931
I chose him.

53:47.140 --> 53:49.225
And that is a more powerful bond,

53:49.309 --> 53:52.145
a more powerful love
than being born into it.

53:56.066 --> 53:58.818
I aim to show him that love
when we meet up again.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.157
We know he came through this way.

54:05.241 --> 54:06.534
A skinny little fella.

54:07.243 --> 54:09.537
The kind you might
mistakenly underestimate.

54:10.872 --> 54:12.540
We've not seen anyone.

54:14.584 --> 54:15.585
Hm.

54:17.045 --> 54:18.380
Of course, he may be dead.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.300
But then he's been dead before, so...

54:22.384 --> 54:23.510
[chuckles]

54:29.599 --> 54:30.892
Well, now...

54:31.935 --> 54:34.938
I think that tonight,
we're just gonna bed down over there.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.607
In the morning, we'll, uh, move on,

54:37.691 --> 54:38.858
leave you folks be.

54:41.069 --> 54:42.237
But before we do...

54:43.571 --> 54:45.907
I need you two gentlemen to decide...

54:48.076 --> 54:52.080
which of your lovely wives
is gonna visit me in my blankets.

54:53.331 --> 54:56.251
[speaking in Norwegian]

55:02.382 --> 55:03.591
[speaks in Norwegian]

55:04.342 --> 55:06.636
[Frank] Of course,
if you both want to come along...

55:07.804 --> 55:09.180
you're more than welcome.

55:14.227 --> 55:16.229
[horses whinnying]

55:33.913 --> 55:34.914
Ma'am.

55:37.667 --> 55:41.504
The Paiutes say you either live
with the land or you die.

55:43.298 --> 55:46.176
Well, I can't seem to live
with this land, but I'm stuck.

55:47.927 --> 55:50.096
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you've done...

55:51.306 --> 55:54.684
but I've got 30-something animals need
to be broke and no one to help me do it.

55:56.644 --> 55:58.271
Truckee's still just a boy.

55:58.897 --> 56:01.358
And he won't admit it,
but he's afraid of horses.

56:02.692 --> 56:06.488
Seems his father died before he could
teach his son how to be a proper Indian.

56:08.573 --> 56:10.575
Anyway, I'd go to the Paiutes, but then...

56:11.618 --> 56:15.580
Chief Narrienta would send me
one of his sons, and there'd be...

56:15.663 --> 56:18.249
well, certain strings attached.

56:20.168 --> 56:21.252
I can't pay you...

56:22.170 --> 56:24.339
but I'll give you the best horse
when you're through.

56:25.799 --> 56:28.968
An animal strong enough
to carry you all the way to California.

56:34.432 --> 56:37.227
Lady, I don't mean no offense...

56:38.228 --> 56:40.480
but you don't want me
anywhere near you or your boy.

56:41.856 --> 56:43.316
Because you're so dangerous?

56:44.025 --> 56:47.112
You were right the first time
you told me I couldn't stay.

56:48.029 --> 56:49.114
You don't know me.

56:50.198 --> 56:51.741
You're the terrible Roy Goode.

56:52.325 --> 56:54.494
You got a letter
with the man's name on it.

56:55.703 --> 56:59.165
But then again, it hasn't even been
opened, so maybe it's not yours.

57:00.667 --> 57:01.751
I don't know.

57:02.460 --> 57:05.588
I look you in the eye,
and you don't seem so stone cold to me.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.633
You just seem lost.

57:10.593 --> 57:11.803
Maybe a little sad.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.181
Oh, I am who I say.

57:17.308 --> 57:20.437
And it ain't gonna be long
before someone comes looking for me.

57:20.520 --> 57:24.149
-Like who? Bill's gone for a while.
-That deputy ain't gonna wake up happy.

57:24.232 --> 57:26.067
-I'll handle Whitey.
-Ma'am...

57:27.485 --> 57:28.611
I'm bad luck.

57:28.695 --> 57:29.529
Well...

57:30.280 --> 57:31.739
we have that in common, then.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.286
Do we have a deal?

57:39.414 --> 57:40.832
[sighs]

57:42.375 --> 57:43.376
No, ma'am.

57:45.003 --> 57:47.714
If I was to stay here
and break them horses for you...

57:48.882 --> 57:51.134
there'd be something else
I'd be wanting from you.

57:53.052 --> 57:54.262
And what might that be?

57:59.851 --> 58:01.102
Teach me how to read.

58:06.483 --> 58:07.567
I could do that.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.915
[knocking]

58:56.699 --> 58:57.700
[grunts]

58:58.076 --> 58:59.077
Morning.

59:00.245 --> 59:01.579
Mr. Law!

59:02.121 --> 59:03.414
-Morning.
-Coffee?

59:03.498 --> 59:04.499
Thank you.

59:06.668 --> 59:07.835
[coffee pouring]

59:07.919 --> 59:08.920
What's for breakfast?

59:13.633 --> 59:14.884
[grunts]

59:14.968 --> 59:15.969
I'll have, uh...

59:16.761 --> 59:17.887
I'll have whatever's good.

59:19.138 --> 59:20.139
Nothing's good.

59:21.766 --> 59:24.686
But you can't go wrong
with fried eggs and grits.

59:25.603 --> 59:27.063
I'll have that.

59:27.146 --> 59:28.147
Bacon?

59:28.231 --> 59:29.983
Sure. Why not? It's Saturday.

59:31.943 --> 59:33.069
Sweet Jesus!

59:34.654 --> 59:36.531
That's strong enough to float an egg.

59:37.115 --> 59:38.575
So they say.

59:38.658 --> 59:39.659
Hang on.

59:43.955 --> 59:46.624
Large party of men come through here
any time recent?

59:47.292 --> 59:48.418
Sadly, no.

59:49.627 --> 59:51.754
Truth is, nobody much comes through here.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.881
Unless it's Wednesday
and the train's coming.

59:53.965 --> 59:56.092
Of course. Thank you, anyhow.

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:03.182
[footsteps]

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:04.267
[man] Friend?

1:00:05.018 --> 1:00:06.019
Edward Solomon.

1:00:06.853 --> 1:00:08.938
Oh, that is one fearful conglomerate.

1:00:09.022 --> 1:00:09.856
[laughs]

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:12.567
Myself, I made it three sips
and abandoned all hope.

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:15.361
You may have seen my rig out front.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.115
Or not, given your condition.

1:00:20.283 --> 1:00:21.909
I believe I have just the thing.

1:00:24.662 --> 1:00:25.747
There you go, Sheriff.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:26.914
Try those on.

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:30.126
Go on. Your life's about to change.

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:41.888
[grunts]

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:43.139
I'm a bit dizzy.

1:00:43.222 --> 1:00:45.141
Well, they are
rather powerfully magnified.

1:00:45.224 --> 1:00:47.518
That's why I'd only wear them
for reading and such,

1:00:47.602 --> 1:00:49.395
and even then, not for too long.

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:50.480
How much?

1:00:50.563 --> 1:00:52.732
For you, an officer of the law,

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:56.027
a virtual human barricade
between chaos and civilization?

1:00:56.110 --> 1:00:57.945
-How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

1:00:58.029 --> 1:01:00.948
Half the cost of your breakfast,
and they'll last you twice as long.

1:01:04.243 --> 1:01:05.244
Thank you.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:12.085
You know, I was in Trinidad recently,
maybe about a month ago.

1:01:13.461 --> 1:01:15.963
-Trinidad?
-Colorado, just over the border.

1:01:16.506 --> 1:01:18.007
I was playing cards,

1:01:18.091 --> 1:01:20.968
a vice that I'm prone to, I'll admit,

1:01:21.052 --> 1:01:23.346
when a large group of gentlemen
came into the saloon.

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:25.556
Well, how large?

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.476
Oh, I'd say about... well, 25, at least.

1:01:29.102 --> 1:01:32.772
Most of them went upstairs to the
whorehouse. They have a good one there.

1:01:33.022 --> 1:01:34.732
Another vice you're prone to?

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:36.776
[chuckles] Well, I'm a married man.

1:01:36.859 --> 1:01:38.069
[McNue] Mm-hm.

1:01:38.152 --> 1:01:40.988
Anyway, one of the gents came over
and sat down at the table.

1:01:41.072 --> 1:01:42.448
I didn't know him, of course,

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:45.410
but I could see that all the others
were suddenly afraid to win.

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:47.120
Did he say anything to you?

1:01:47.662 --> 1:01:50.498
Uh... He had some
unusual thoughts on religion.

1:01:50.998 --> 1:01:54.293
I was particularly amused by his assertion
that the original Garden of Eden,

1:01:54.377 --> 1:01:57.547
according to him,
is to be found in Independence, Missouri.

1:01:58.423 --> 1:02:00.633
I assume you didn't share
your amusement with the man,

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:02.093
or you wouldn't be here to tell me.

1:02:02.176 --> 1:02:03.094
[chuckles] I did not.

1:02:03.678 --> 1:02:04.846
[McNue] Hm.

1:02:04.929 --> 1:02:07.014
Well, he say where he was headed?

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:09.225
No, but he did speak at some length

1:02:09.308 --> 1:02:11.561
as to the beauty of a place
called Bald Knob.

1:02:12.395 --> 1:02:14.939
One had the feeling
he was anxious to get back there.

1:02:15.898 --> 1:02:16.941
Bald Knob.

1:02:17.692 --> 1:02:19.902
You have any idea where that might be?

1:02:19.986 --> 1:02:22.405
No, I can't say. I didn't ask.

1:02:22.488 --> 1:02:24.782
I sensed a broody turn
in the man at that point,

1:02:24.866 --> 1:02:28.119
so I bid the table good night
and got the hell out while I could.

1:02:29.036 --> 1:02:30.037
[McNue] Hm.

1:02:31.372 --> 1:02:33.040
Well, thank you.

1:02:34.542 --> 1:02:35.543
Thank you.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.964
"To Marshal John Cook.

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:41.132
Stop.

1:02:41.215 --> 1:02:43.676
Have R.G. in custody in La Belle.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:44.761
Stop.

1:02:45.386 --> 1:02:47.180
Will meet up in Olegrande.

1:02:47.263 --> 1:02:48.097
Stop."

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:50.057
Signed... "Bill McNue."

1:02:51.642 --> 1:02:52.643
Who's "R.G."?

1:02:52.727 --> 1:02:54.937
[clears throat] Just send the damn thing.

1:02:56.522 --> 1:02:58.149
[child screaming]

1:02:58.232 --> 1:02:59.817
[hooves beating]

1:02:59.901 --> 1:03:00.902
[gunshot]

1:03:00.985 --> 1:03:02.612
[screaming continues]

1:03:08.826 --> 1:03:09.660
[gunshot]

1:03:09.744 --> 1:03:11.370
[screaming continues]

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:13.790
[gunshot]

1:03:16.542 --> 1:03:17.543
Papa!

1:03:18.753 --> 1:03:19.754
[gasps]

1:03:19.837 --> 1:03:21.672
[buzzing]

1:03:23.508 --> 1:03:25.134
[panting]

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:37.355
[woman gasps]

1:03:38.397 --> 1:03:39.816
[sobs]

1:03:42.151 --> 1:03:43.152
Dear Lord.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:45.571
[grunts]

1:03:46.531 --> 1:03:47.782
[Floyd] If he came this way...

1:03:48.699 --> 1:03:49.951
he didn't leave no trail.

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:58.835
So what you're saying is you ain't got
no idea which way he's headed?

1:04:01.629 --> 1:04:04.298
Well, maybe...
if we had come before the rains.

1:04:04.882 --> 1:04:06.509
[Frank panting]

1:04:24.944 --> 1:04:26.571
[child sobbing]

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.742
[bees buzzing]

1:04:43.963 --> 1:04:46.048
Call yourselves husbands and fathers?

1:04:46.132 --> 1:04:49.594
Why ain't neither of you dead,
or at least beat some around the face?

1:04:50.386 --> 1:04:51.804
Why don't you fight?

1:04:54.348 --> 1:04:57.810
Good Book says, "A man who lays down
like a lamb stays down."

1:04:58.769 --> 1:05:00.396
You are no man of God!

1:05:03.024 --> 1:05:04.025
[chuckles]

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:11.908
God?

1:05:13.910 --> 1:05:15.119
What God?

1:05:16.662 --> 1:05:18.539
Mister, you clearly don't know
where you are.

1:05:19.874 --> 1:05:20.875
Look around.

1:05:23.878 --> 1:05:27.673
There ain't no higher-up around here
to watch over you and your young'ns.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:32.386
This here's the paradise of the locust...

1:05:33.012 --> 1:05:35.222
the lizard... the snake.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.852
It's the land of the blade and the rifle.

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:44.106
It's godless country.

1:05:46.275 --> 1:05:49.111
And the sooner you accept
your inevitable demise,

1:05:49.195 --> 1:05:50.863
the longer you're all gonna live.

1:05:52.573 --> 1:05:53.616
If you think about it...

1:05:53.699 --> 1:05:54.533
[gunshot]

1:05:56.202 --> 1:05:57.745
-[gunshot]
-[Jacob yells]

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:00.873
[woman yells]

1:06:03.042 --> 1:06:04.669
[yelling continues]

1:06:05.336 --> 1:06:06.712
You know, if you think about it...

1:06:08.798 --> 1:06:12.093
the same God that made you and me
also made the rattlesnake.

1:06:14.136 --> 1:06:15.680
That just don't make no sense.

1:06:22.144 --> 1:06:24.105
All a man can count on is hisself.

1:06:26.732 --> 1:06:27.733
That's the truth.

1:06:32.113 --> 1:06:33.114
[chuckles]

1:06:34.198 --> 1:06:35.241
[buzzing]

1:06:35.324 --> 1:06:38.619
What... What is with
all these infernal bumblebees?

1:06:51.298 --> 1:06:53.300
[buzzing continues]

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:15.573
Floyd...

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:17.992
what town is that way?

1:07:19.452 --> 1:07:20.453
North?

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:22.496
Olegrande.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.043
Well, then...

1:07:31.130 --> 1:07:32.131
[grunts]

1:07:38.637 --> 1:07:40.639
...let's go to Olegrande.
