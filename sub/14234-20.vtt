WEBVTT

00:01.788 --> 00:03.343
BP dropping. 80 over 40.

00:03.368 --> 00:04.568
What's happening to him?

00:04.593 --> 00:05.590
Where the hell is neurosurge?

00:05.615 --> 00:06.996
We lost the pulse.
We lost the pulse.

00:07.414 --> 00:09.041
Elias!

00:11.294 --> 00:12.494
I know you poisoned the President.

00:13.048 --> 00:14.599
I know you're working
with Sophia.

00:14.683 --> 00:15.950
That's preposterous!
Now, you listen to me!

00:16.018 --> 00:17.318
You listen!

00:17.386 --> 00:19.053
The only reason she helped you
get where you are...

00:19.121 --> 00:20.722
Remember
who you're talking to!

00:20.789 --> 00:22.323
Is because she knew
it would give her control

00:22.391 --> 00:23.324
of this office.

00:23.392 --> 00:24.592
You may tender
your resignation

00:24.660 --> 00:26.027
effective immediately.

00:26.095 --> 00:28.329
We'll need to run more tests
on the lung tissue

00:28.397 --> 00:30.264
as soon as it ts here.
Where is it now?

00:30.332 --> 00:31.899
In a temperature-controlled
container.

00:31.950 --> 00:34.068
Our courier is hand-carrying it
as we speak.

00:34.136 --> 00:36.671
Sean! Go, go!

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.750 --> 00:49.851
Drop it
or I'll kill him!

00:49.918 --> 00:51.252
Drop it now!

00:51.303 --> 00:53.754
Vicky, shoot him!
Don't let them take the case!

00:59.661 --> 01:00.928
Gotta get you
out of here.

01:00.996 --> 01:02.263
Michael and Simon are gone.

01:02.314 --> 01:04.032
We have to find them
before they escape.

01:07.436 --> 01:09.654
There's a vial
in my pocket.

01:09.738 --> 01:11.873
Get it to the President
as soon as you can.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.776
No, dad! Dad!

01:20.215 --> 01:23.651
Michael...

01:29.892 --> 01:30.825
He's gone.

01:35.197 --> 01:39.033
Sophia, I'm--I'm sorry.

01:39.101 --> 01:40.468
We were trying to stop them
from escaping.

01:40.519 --> 01:42.170
I'm so sorry.

01:42.237 --> 01:43.871
It's not your fault.

01:43.939 --> 01:45.373
Look what you did
to him!

01:45.441 --> 01:47.542
You killed my father.
I hate you.

01:47.609 --> 01:50.278
I've known your father
longer than you can comprehend.

01:50.329 --> 01:54.148
You have no idea
what I felt for him.

01:54.216 --> 01:56.484
Did he have it?
Michael?

01:56.535 --> 01:59.153
- What are you talking about?
- The compound.

01:59.204 --> 02:01.422
Michael came into the lab.
I tried to stop him.

02:01.490 --> 02:03.257
- What compound?
- A counteragent.

02:03.325 --> 02:04.675
DNA repair enzymes.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.211
It can reverse the effects
of the poison we gave Martinez.

02:09.832 --> 02:14.168
- Search them.
- Let go of me!

02:14.219 --> 02:15.937
It has to be Simon.

02:16.004 --> 02:17.772
We have to assume
that he's on the way

02:17.839 --> 02:19.207
to the hospital now.

02:19.274 --> 02:20.641
If Martinez recovers,

02:20.709 --> 02:22.243
everything that we've
been working toward

02:22.311 --> 02:23.878
will be compromised.
No.

02:23.946 --> 02:25.213
I will send a search team
after him.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.181
No. Simon
is a highly trained agent.

02:27.249 --> 02:29.016
You'll never find him.

02:29.084 --> 02:30.368
But I have another way.

02:30.452 --> 02:31.652
In the meantime,

02:31.703 --> 02:33.204
we have to completely evacuate
the compound.

02:33.288 --> 02:35.957
Make sure everyone's safe
before Simon has a chance

02:36.024 --> 02:39.060
to alert the authorities.

02:40.696 --> 02:43.131
Get her away from him.

02:43.198 --> 02:47.885
No. No. Let--
let go of me!

02:57.045 --> 02:59.230
Daddy's still sleeping,
honey.

02:59.314 --> 03:01.749
But he wants you
to be strong

03:01.817 --> 03:04.485
and send him good thoughts,
okay?

03:09.224 --> 03:12.560
All right, be a good boy.
I'll be home soon.

03:12.611 --> 03:15.396
Love you.

03:20.836 --> 03:22.436
Our son...

03:22.504 --> 03:24.939
He wants to see his daddy.

03:28.677 --> 03:31.262
So what's the next step?

03:31.346 --> 03:33.614
At this point,
I'm afraid we've done

03:33.682 --> 03:37.351
everything we can,
Mrs. Martinez.

03:37.419 --> 03:41.322
He's not getting any better.
He's getting worse.

03:41.390 --> 03:43.991
I'm sorry.

03:44.059 --> 03:47.195
You're just gonna give up?

03:47.262 --> 03:50.398
No. No.

03:57.539 --> 03:58.739
We've narrowed down
the options

03:58.790 --> 04:00.608
for Director Sterling's
replacement.

04:00.659 --> 04:02.443
These are very good candidates.

04:02.494 --> 04:04.612
I don't want
very good candidates.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.815
- I want the best.
- You fired the best.

04:07.883 --> 04:10.718
With all due respect.

04:10.785 --> 04:13.721
Director Sterling
was a dangerous man.

04:13.788 --> 04:15.389
The things he said about me,

04:15.457 --> 04:17.524
the man is not
in his right mind.

04:17.593 --> 04:18.959
I can't have a man like that
at the head

04:19.027 --> 04:20.394
of the intelligence
operations.

04:20.462 --> 04:23.231
And for you to constantly
remind me of his importance

04:23.298 --> 04:28.569
only makes you suspect.

04:28.637 --> 04:30.688
I'm sorry.

04:30.772 --> 04:32.840
I didn't mean...

04:36.211 --> 04:38.329
One second.

04:38.413 --> 04:42.617
Hello.

04:42.668 --> 04:43.751
Excuse me.

04:43.819 --> 04:45.720
Uh, that'll be all,
Mr. Peel.

04:45.787 --> 04:46.887
Thank you very much.

04:54.763 --> 04:57.381
Yes?
We have a problem.

04:57.466 --> 04:59.600
Simon Lee has gotten a hold
of a counteragent.

04:59.668 --> 05:02.937
- A counteragent?
- He can use it

05:03.005 --> 05:05.106
to reverse the effects
of the poison we gave Martinez.

05:05.173 --> 05:07.892
How did this happen?

05:07.976 --> 05:09.944
I knew this was a mistake.

05:10.012 --> 05:12.280
I can't believe I let you--
Raymond, listen to me.

05:12.347 --> 05:14.015
You need to focus
all your energies

05:14.082 --> 05:16.017
on finding Simon Lee
and stopping him

05:16.084 --> 05:19.353
before he reaches
that hospital.

05:19.421 --> 05:21.722
It's easy for you to sit back
and issue commands.

05:21.790 --> 05:22.990
But I'm the one

05:23.058 --> 05:24.625
that has to handle the reality
on the ground.

05:24.693 --> 05:26.294
The reality is that you have
every resource

05:26.361 --> 05:28.095
of the federal government
available to you

05:28.163 --> 05:29.096
to find one man.

05:29.164 --> 05:30.414
Use them.

05:30.499 --> 05:34.135
Because if Martinez recovers
and the truth comes out,

05:34.202 --> 05:37.204
they will put you away
for the rest of your life.

05:54.356 --> 05:58.356

06:04.970 --> 06:06.970
There's no sign of their car.

06:06.996 --> 06:08.514
And we can't just keep driving.

06:08.598 --> 06:10.549
If we want to stop Sophia
from getting her hands

06:10.633 --> 06:12.667
on this virus,
then--then we're gonna need

06:12.719 --> 06:14.336
some help.
I'm working on it.

06:14.404 --> 06:16.772
No, we need to call the police
and just tell them what we know.

06:16.839 --> 06:18.440
We can't. We know
from what happened on the plane

06:18.508 --> 06:19.775
that someone high up
in the government

06:19.842 --> 06:21.076
is helping Sophia.

06:21.144 --> 06:22.861
But I've got their plates
and I know their car

06:22.946 --> 06:25.147
was a rental.
And?

06:25.198 --> 06:26.231
Since the mid-'90s,

06:26.316 --> 06:28.183
every rental car
has a tracking device

06:28.234 --> 06:29.818
so the companies can monitor
their vehicles.

06:29.869 --> 06:31.286
So if I can get
into the company's system,

06:31.354 --> 06:33.288
I might be able
to find the car.

06:33.356 --> 06:35.457
"Might."

06:35.525 --> 06:37.059
Sorry.

06:37.126 --> 06:39.528
You saw what that virus did
to those people on the ship.

06:39.579 --> 06:40.913
How they died.

06:40.997 --> 06:43.966
If Sophia releases the virus,
how bad could it be?

06:44.033 --> 06:45.968
The original Spanish flue
epidemic killed

06:46.035 --> 06:48.720
between 50
and 100 million people

06:48.805 --> 06:50.705
and that's before
international travel

06:50.757 --> 06:52.224
was so easy.

06:52.308 --> 06:54.209
And this strain's
more virulent?

06:54.260 --> 06:55.561
Way more.

06:55.645 --> 06:58.614
If Sophia released it,
I don't know what would be left.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.432
Hey.
What do you got?

07:00.517 --> 07:04.820
Hopefully them.
50 miles up ahead.

07:11.961 --> 07:14.396
Word from Gerard
just came in.

07:14.447 --> 07:15.948
He was able to establish
communication

07:16.032 --> 07:17.199
with the home planet.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.567
It's worse than we thought.

07:18.618 --> 07:20.836
Radiation levels
have become catastrophic.

07:20.903 --> 07:22.454
People are dying.

07:22.539 --> 07:24.423
We need to make room here.
We need to get this done.

07:24.507 --> 07:26.174
I understand that better
than anyone.

07:26.242 --> 07:28.677
How close are we
to releasing the virus?

07:28.744 --> 07:31.013
Close. But in order
for a global pandemic

07:31.080 --> 07:32.180
to be successful,

07:32.248 --> 07:33.982
the host has to survive
long enough

07:34.050 --> 07:35.601
to spread the disease.

07:35.685 --> 07:40.188
This is the footage Aaron sent
from the Irina Bogdanov.

07:40.256 --> 07:42.624
The doctor handling the virus
was human,

07:42.692 --> 07:44.476
and therefore not immune
like us.

07:44.561 --> 07:48.146
There. His clean suit
becomes compromised.

07:48.231 --> 07:49.464
This is the point of infection.

07:49.532 --> 07:52.200
The conditions for this outbreak
were not suitable

07:52.268 --> 07:53.802
for drawing any conclusions.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.637
It was released
in close quarters

07:55.705 --> 07:57.706
in great concentration.

07:57.774 --> 07:59.341
I need a more
accurate simulation

07:59.409 --> 08:02.628
to judge the efficacy
of the virus.

08:02.712 --> 08:04.913
If it's more reliable data
you need,

08:04.981 --> 08:07.115
the next field test
should provide it.

08:36.412 --> 08:40.782
Freeze.
Hands in the air.

08:40.832 --> 08:44.319
Turn around. Slowly.

08:50.159 --> 08:53.762
Simon.

08:53.829 --> 08:55.297
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't put

08:55.365 --> 08:56.348
a bullet in you right now?

08:56.432 --> 08:58.517
Martinez.
I can save his life.

08:58.601 --> 09:00.185
Don't play me, Simon.

09:00.269 --> 09:02.070
I know Sophia used Jarvis
to poison the President.

09:02.138 --> 09:03.522
Why would they want
to spare him now?

09:03.606 --> 09:06.074
They don't. I do.

09:06.142 --> 09:08.176
I've split with Sophia
for good.

09:08.227 --> 09:10.062
Once I realized
what she wanted to do.

09:10.146 --> 09:12.280
How many people she was willing
to murder.

09:15.818 --> 09:17.619
- I don't believe you.
- I have a counteragent.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.122
An antidote.
Why would I trust you?

09:20.189 --> 09:22.057
Everything you ever told me
was a lie.

09:22.125 --> 09:24.092
It's the truth.
I was free and clear.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.911
Why else would I risk
coming back here?

09:25.995 --> 09:28.130
Maybe you think
you can manipulate me.

09:28.197 --> 09:30.766
Sophia did it to Martinez
time and time again.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.868
Turns out I was an even bigger
fool than he was.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.737
I'm sorry.

09:35.805 --> 09:37.389
But believe me
when I say I was doing it

09:37.473 --> 09:38.890
for the common good.

09:38.975 --> 09:43.979
Even now, I still believe
there can be peace between us.

09:44.047 --> 09:46.481
- How?
- Starting with this.

09:46.549 --> 09:51.653
Slowly.

09:51.721 --> 09:54.723
You can undo what they did
to Martinez with this.

09:54.774 --> 09:57.159
Take it.

09:57.226 --> 09:58.560
What possible motive
could I have

09:58.628 --> 10:00.629
other than saving his life?

10:00.697 --> 10:04.533
He's going to die anyway?
What do you have to lose?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.768
Look, you don't believe me,
shoot me.

10:06.836 --> 10:09.955
Just get this to Martinez
before it's too late.

10:17.246 --> 10:18.413
Move away from the window.

10:18.464 --> 10:19.931
What is it?

10:24.604 --> 10:26.321
Silver sedan
across the street.

10:26.389 --> 10:29.257
Were you followed?
No. No. I'm sure of it.

10:29.325 --> 10:31.493
Then Jarvis must've put
a tail on me.

10:31.561 --> 10:33.094
Why?

10:33.146 --> 10:34.863
Sophia's working
with the Vice President.

10:34.931 --> 10:36.832
We have to assume she told him
to stop you

10:36.899 --> 10:38.667
before you could save
Martinez.

10:38.735 --> 10:41.503
And Jarvis knew
I'd come to you for help.

10:48.978 --> 10:52.180
- It's Lee.
- Are you sure?

10:52.248 --> 10:55.167
He was my partner
for ten years.

10:55.251 --> 10:59.421
Man. So they really are
working together.

10:59.472 --> 11:02.390
We have a visual of Agent Lee
inside the house.

11:02.458 --> 11:05.393
Copy that.
We'll cover the back.

11:06.896 --> 11:08.313
Let's move.

11:22.328 --> 11:24.813
They've stopped.
Ten miles out.

11:24.864 --> 11:26.147
Where?

11:26.199 --> 11:27.816
Cross-referencing
to a street map.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.001
There's the car.

11:46.068 --> 11:48.036
Okay.
Just keep driving past it.

11:51.891 --> 11:53.041
No one.

12:07.824 --> 12:09.124
I don't see any case.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.200
Blueprints of the mall.

12:19.252 --> 12:22.003
Details of the air
circulation system.

12:33.099 --> 12:35.049
Sophia wants a record
of this.

12:35.101 --> 12:36.885
Port all surveillance cameras
to her.

12:36.936 --> 12:39.387
Meet me on the roof.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.813
Biel and I will make
the front entry.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.023
Berman and Diaz,
you back us up

13:12.075 --> 13:13.325
and watch the side windows.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.494
Hayes and Reese,
hold down the back of the house.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.696
- Copy that.
- On my go, guys.

13:17.747 --> 13:22.200
What is that?

13:27.090 --> 13:29.925
Hold your positions.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.378
Drop your weapons now!

13:33.446 --> 13:34.730
- Federal Agent!
- Put it on the ground!

13:34.814 --> 13:35.931
- We have credentials!
- Shut up!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.065
I said drop your weapons!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.734
You guys are blowing
a CIA operation!

13:38.818 --> 13:41.019
Last warning!
Drop your guns!

13:41.070 --> 13:43.188
Drop them. Easy.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.690
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.774
Easy. Easy. Easy.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.698
Check my left back pocket.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.668
Left back pocket.

13:56.736 --> 14:00.038
We're on a covert op.
At least it was covert.

14:05.628 --> 14:08.430
They're legit.
Stand down.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.098
We got a 911 call
about an armed robbery

14:10.183 --> 14:12.434
at this address.
Son of a bitch. Move in.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.771
Hayes, Reese, move in!

14:21.194 --> 14:25.264
- Okay!
- Clear!

14:25.331 --> 14:28.900
Men down!

14:28.952 --> 14:33.972
- Went out?
- Yeah.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.775
Damn it.

14:36.826 --> 14:39.378
How did you let this happen?

14:39.445 --> 14:42.447
You had your best men
on this?

14:42.498 --> 14:46.168
I don't care.
You find them and stop them!

14:57.296 --> 15:00.632
- Yes.
- There's been a problem.

15:00.683 --> 15:02.334
We almost had
the counteragent.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.636
Agent Lee escaped.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.638
With all the resources
that you have

15:06.706 --> 15:08.807
at your disposal,
you can't find one man?

15:11.194 --> 15:12.644
There's something else.

15:12.695 --> 15:17.449
Agent Lee escaped
with Blake Sterling's help.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.052
They're working together now.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.854
You understand
that if Martinez recovers

15:22.922 --> 15:24.356
and returns
to the Presidency,

15:24.424 --> 15:26.291
we'd no longer
have an agreement.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.061
Because one of your people
found an antidote?

15:29.128 --> 15:33.165
I don't appreciate your tone,
Raymond.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.800
You're changing the terms.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.136
I did my part by getting
Martinez out of the way.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.039
And you agreed to spare
American lives.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.842
Keep Simon from getting
the counteragent to Martinez

15:43.910 --> 15:46.228
and that will still
be the case.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.847
Your country will be spared
when my people arrive.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.850
How do I know
you're not playing me?

15:51.901 --> 15:54.853
Do as I say, Raymond.
You have no other options.

16:02.245 --> 16:03.712
I didn't expect
to start the day

16:03.796 --> 16:05.047
by stealing a car.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.866
We have to assume Martinez
will be heavily guarded.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.585
There's no way we'll be able
to get the antidote to him.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.304
Not in time.

16:12.371 --> 16:15.073
Last word from the doctor
is it's only a matter of hours.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.258
Can we use Peel?

16:16.342 --> 16:19.210
Jarvis will be suspicious
of him too.

16:19.262 --> 16:20.679
There's only one other option.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.397
The First Lady.

16:22.482 --> 16:28.186
The only problem is Jarvis
probably realizes that too.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.828
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.131
This is a restricted zone.
What?

16:39.198 --> 16:41.133
The White House raised
the security protocol.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.901
Access to President Martinez
is restricted

16:42.952 --> 16:44.302
to essential personnel only.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.538
I'm his wife.
I was just with him.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.923
I left to go and see my son.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.541
I'm sorry, ma'am,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.376
but the Attorney General's
orders were very clear.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.752
Call the Attorney General's
office.

17:00.803 --> 17:02.687
I mean, there must be
some sort of mix-up.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.790
I'm his wife.
I should have access.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.023
Yes, ma'am.
I'll do it right away.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.325
I have to go.

17:07.393 --> 17:11.279
Call me as soon as you hear
anything. Hello?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.763
Christina,
it's Blake Sterling.

17:12.815 --> 17:14.483
- Blake.
- We need to talk,

17:14.567 --> 17:18.069
but we can't do it
under these circumstances.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.738
- Go ahead.
- We intercepted

17:19.789 --> 17:22.307
a 24-second conversation
between Mrs. Martinez

17:22.375 --> 17:23.992
and former Director
Sterling.

17:24.076 --> 17:28.880
- 24 seconds. Is that all?
- Yes, sir.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.383
- Well, what did Sterling say?
- We don't know yet.

17:31.451 --> 17:35.387
The call was encrypted.
Then decrypt it.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.590
As I told you before,
it's for her own protection.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.492
Now, how long will it take you
to decrypt it?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.727
- Within a few hours.
- Damn it.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.530
I don't have that kind of time.
Eva!

17:47.600 --> 17:49.000
Mr. President.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.486
Get me a location
on the First Lady.

18:23.650 --> 18:25.150
The air units
are on the roof.

18:25.235 --> 18:27.269
You have to evacuate everyone
as fast as you can.

18:27.337 --> 18:29.455
- Sean.
- What?

18:29.539 --> 18:30.839
Be careful.

18:50.844 --> 18:52.694
- Yes.
- I've got you routed

18:52.762 --> 18:54.496
into the video surveillance
system.

18:54.564 --> 18:56.315
You should have a visual
on the site now.

18:56.399 --> 18:58.233
How much longer
before you proceed

18:58.301 --> 18:59.651
with the test?

18:59.736 --> 19:02.971
Alex is aerosolizing
the virus as we speak.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.433
Excuse me.
I need your help.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.968
We have to evacuate the mall.
What?

19:33.036 --> 19:34.336
I'm a federal agent.

19:34.404 --> 19:35.571
Someone disabled
the fire alarm

19:35.638 --> 19:37.055
and they're about to release
a bioweapon

19:37.140 --> 19:39.007
through the ventilation system.
How do you know this?

19:39.058 --> 19:40.192
Listen to me.

19:40.276 --> 19:41.476
Everybody in this mall
is gonna die

19:41.544 --> 19:43.312
unless you sound the alarm
and get them out.

19:43.379 --> 19:46.982
I got to talk
to my supervisor, okay?

19:47.033 --> 19:48.450
No, you're gonna listen
to me

19:48.517 --> 19:50.953
or you're gonna be the first one
to die, all right?

19:51.020 --> 19:54.489
Now move.

19:59.078 --> 20:00.212
Look at camera four.

20:00.296 --> 20:01.914
That's the man
from Alex's flight.

20:01.998 --> 20:04.933
The one who tried to stop us.

20:05.001 --> 20:08.587
- His name is Sean Walker.
- You know him?

20:08.671 --> 20:10.405
Yes. And I think I know
who told him Alex

20:10.473 --> 20:11.907
was on the plane.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.576
He must've figured out
we were gonna release the virus.

20:14.644 --> 20:18.347
You can't let him stop it.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.370
- What's going on?
- Keep working.

21:22.045 --> 21:23.378
This is not acceptable.

21:23.446 --> 21:24.713
I don't care
what you have to do

21:24.780 --> 21:26.481
to get it done,
just do it.

21:26.549 --> 21:28.950
I am his wife.
They can't just shut me out.

21:29.002 --> 21:30.836
Christina.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.022
I came to check on Eli.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.058
I wanted to speak
to his doctors personally.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.260
How's he doing?
Well, I wouldn't know.

21:38.328 --> 21:39.928
They won't let me see him.

21:39.996 --> 21:42.147
The Attorney General
issued some sort of order.

21:42.231 --> 21:44.099
Well, there must be some
miscommunication.

21:44.150 --> 21:46.702
I told the Attorney General
to limit all access

21:46.769 --> 21:48.770
to Eli's room,
but I should have specified

21:48.838 --> 21:49.938
it didn't apply to you.

21:49.989 --> 21:53.025
I'll call him.
I'll make it right.

21:56.512 --> 21:59.948
Christina, there's something
I need to tell you.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.656
Eli didn't have a stroke.

22:07.724 --> 22:10.992
He was poisoned.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.194
What?

22:12.261 --> 22:14.796
I know this will come
as big of a shock to you

22:14.864 --> 22:15.964
as it did to me.

22:16.032 --> 22:17.699
But Director Blake Sterling

22:17.767 --> 22:20.702
and one of his agents,
Simon Lee,

22:20.770 --> 22:23.004
are working together.

22:23.056 --> 22:26.074
They're the ones that tried
to kill your husband.

22:26.142 --> 22:30.679
No. I don't believe that.
That can't be true.

22:30.747 --> 22:33.248
I didn't believe it either.
But there's no question.

22:33.316 --> 22:34.649
I'll show you
all the evidence later.

22:34.717 --> 22:36.718
But now you understand
why I have to control the access

22:36.786 --> 22:38.286
to Eli's room.

22:38.354 --> 22:42.741
I'm afraid Blake and Agent Lee
will try again.

22:42.825 --> 22:46.161
After what happened
in Coral Gables, Ray,

22:46.212 --> 22:48.263
how do you expect me
to ever trust me again?

22:48.331 --> 22:51.533
Christina, can't you see now
I had nothing to do with that?

22:51.601 --> 22:55.003
These men--Blake Sterling
and Agent Lee--

22:55.054 --> 22:59.608
will stop at nothing.

22:59.675 --> 23:02.878
Last time I saw Blake,
we were at Elias' bedside

23:02.945 --> 23:06.014
and I knew there was something
he wasn't telling me.

23:06.065 --> 23:07.716
What do you mean?

23:07.784 --> 23:12.154
He said that there was nothing
anyone could do

23:12.221 --> 23:13.939
to prevent Elias' stroke.

23:14.023 --> 23:15.457
But it was the way
he said it.

23:15.525 --> 23:18.226
I knew that he was keeping
something from me.

23:18.277 --> 23:19.995
And now it makes total sense.

23:20.062 --> 23:22.581
Well, we're going to do
everything we can to find him

23:22.665 --> 23:26.268
to make sure nothing worse
can happen.

23:26.335 --> 23:29.204
But we're at a bit
of a disadvantage.

23:29.255 --> 23:32.941
We have no idea where Sterling
and Agent Lee are.

23:37.096 --> 23:41.383
- I do.
- What?

23:41.451 --> 23:44.052
Blake called me today.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.421
He asked me to meet him
in secret.

23:46.489 --> 23:49.758
My God. Where?

23:49.826 --> 23:52.894
At a warehouse
on South Kendall Street.

23:52.962 --> 23:57.315
South Kendall Street.

23:58.668 --> 24:02.654
I can't believe
this is happening.

24:02.738 --> 24:05.073
Christina,
you have my word

24:05.141 --> 24:08.343
we're going to do everything
we can to find them

24:08.411 --> 24:10.679
and stop them.

24:28.905 --> 24:32.941
Give us a moment, please.

24:38.527 --> 24:42.213
It's hard for me to look at you
and not see him.

24:42.963 --> 24:48.167
Your father. His courage.
His resolve.

24:48.235 --> 24:51.571
I understand you better
than you think.

24:51.639 --> 24:55.475
But you have to know
how misguided you are.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.543
I don't want to hurt anyone.

24:57.611 --> 25:01.080
But if you had to choose
between saving your family

25:01.148 --> 25:03.416
and saving someone else's,
what would you do?

25:03.484 --> 25:07.353
Who would you save?

25:12.059 --> 25:14.560
I need to know what you told
Sean Walker.

25:20.034 --> 25:22.802
- I didn't tell him anything.
- But you did.

25:22.870 --> 25:26.873
Simon or your father told you
about the weapon we've acquired.

25:26.941 --> 25:31.377
I need to know what else
you told him.

25:31.428 --> 25:36.883
Tell me!
Go to hell.

25:36.951 --> 25:39.052
Don't choose the wrong side
on this, Leila,

25:39.119 --> 25:43.122
because I will do everything
I can to protect my people.

25:43.190 --> 25:47.060
My family.
Our family.

25:47.111 --> 25:49.395
I'm not telling you
anything.

25:59.206 --> 26:02.108
By involving Sean in this,
you've ensured his death.

26:02.176 --> 26:06.445
Same way you did
with your father.

26:06.497 --> 26:08.247
Their blood's on your hands.

26:19.259 --> 26:21.127
- Where's the alarm?
- Who did this?

26:21.178 --> 26:23.696
The people I told you about.
Now move it. The alarm.

26:23.764 --> 26:25.848
Master relay's in here.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.600
Even after the alarm sounds,

26:27.651 --> 26:29.969
evacuation time's still rated
at 20, 25 minutes.

26:30.037 --> 26:32.471
There's a lot of people
out there.

26:32.523 --> 26:33.690
Can you turn off
the air system?

26:33.774 --> 26:35.141
We can shut down
the breakers, but...

26:35.209 --> 26:36.275
Do it.

26:36.343 --> 26:37.643
There's a battery backup
somewhere.

26:37.695 --> 26:39.779
I wouldn't know how to do it.
Hit the alarm.

26:39.830 --> 26:43.315
There.

26:43.367 --> 26:45.335
This is an evacuation alert.

26:45.419 --> 26:48.121
Please proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

26:48.172 --> 26:49.672
This is an evacuation alert.

26:49.757 --> 26:52.992
Please proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

26:59.016 --> 27:00.800
This is an evacuation alert.

27:00.851 --> 27:03.335
Please proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

27:25.626 --> 27:28.044
Please proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

27:31.382 --> 27:35.501
Everybody out! Move it!
Come on! Move it!

27:40.557 --> 27:42.392
Let's go. Move.

27:55.856 --> 27:57.273
Keep it moving!
Let's go!

28:07.601 --> 28:09.735
This is an evacuation alert.

28:30.824 --> 28:32.975
Sean!

28:33.060 --> 28:34.861
Sean, where is she?

28:42.769 --> 28:43.970
Vicky!

28:44.037 --> 28:45.788
She's gone.

28:51.411 --> 28:53.246
What is it?

28:53.297 --> 28:55.414
Looks like a pressurized tank

28:55.482 --> 28:58.384
that's connected to the air
recirculating system.

28:58.452 --> 28:59.585
We have to disarm it.

28:59.653 --> 29:01.304
There's still hundreds of people
down there.

29:01.388 --> 29:03.623
Yeah.

29:13.183 --> 29:15.968
Here we are.

29:33.387 --> 29:35.154
This is real-time footage

29:35.222 --> 29:37.823
from an I-mint spy satellite
positioned

29:37.875 --> 29:39.959
on the South Kendall Street
address, sir.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.827
It appears
that the intelligence

29:41.895 --> 29:43.696
you provided was correct,
Mr. President.

29:43.764 --> 29:45.798
Blake Sterling and Simon Lee
are preparing to meet

29:45.849 --> 29:47.133
with your source.

29:47.201 --> 29:49.302
You still haven't told us
who this source is,

29:49.369 --> 29:50.536
Mr. President.

29:50.604 --> 29:52.338
All you need to know
is that the information

29:52.406 --> 29:55.174
I've received has informed me
that traitorous actions

29:55.225 --> 29:57.443
will be set in motion
against our government.

29:57.511 --> 29:59.228
Actions that must be stopped.

29:59.313 --> 30:01.414
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

30:01.481 --> 30:03.249
I find it hard to believe
that Blake Sterling

30:03.317 --> 30:05.751
would participate in any action
that would harm this country.

30:05.819 --> 30:07.920
What more proof do you need,
Mr. Peel?

30:07.988 --> 30:09.422
There it is plain as day.

30:09.489 --> 30:13.926
Meeting covertly with an enemy
of our government.

30:15.746 --> 30:18.047
Our tactical team
is ten minutes out, sir.

30:18.131 --> 30:20.666
Tell them to stand down.
They won't be necessary.

30:20.734 --> 30:22.201
Excuse me?

30:22.269 --> 30:26.205
I'm coordinating
with the Air Force on this.

30:26.273 --> 30:29.141
Ask General McMillan
if the predator drone

30:29.209 --> 30:31.177
is ready for its air strike.

30:31.245 --> 30:33.946
- Air strike?
- You can't possibly be serious.

30:34.014 --> 30:36.582
We are a country at war
and these men are traitors.

30:36.650 --> 30:38.718
With all due respect, sir,
this is a mistake.

30:38.785 --> 30:42.772
This is an order!

30:42.856 --> 30:46.259
Well,
I cannot condone it, sir.

30:46.326 --> 30:50.229
Well, I'm not asking
for your approval, General.

30:50.297 --> 30:52.498
I am the President
of the United States.

30:52.566 --> 30:55.167
I control the military.
I control this office.

30:55.235 --> 30:57.136
And if you can't condone

30:57.204 --> 30:59.071
the actions
of your Commander in Chief,

30:59.122 --> 31:00.539
you can get the hell out!

31:10.951 --> 31:12.051
Anyone else?

31:13.687 --> 31:16.755
The drone is in position,
Mr. President.

31:16.807 --> 31:20.810
This is an assassination.

31:20.894 --> 31:23.112
Tell them
to fire when ready.

31:23.196 --> 31:24.480
You have orders
from the President

31:24.564 --> 31:25.831
to fire when ready.

31:25.899 --> 31:30.303
Okay, you're clear.
Prepare to fire.

31:32.506 --> 31:34.740
Firing, sir.

31:41.415 --> 31:43.916
Copy that.
Missile's on its way.

31:59.733 --> 32:01.484
Direct hit, sir.

32:01.568 --> 32:03.769
The targets
have been eliminated.

32:20.871 --> 32:24.523
I need confirmation
on the kills.

32:24.591 --> 32:26.392
Commander, the President
requires confirmation

32:26.460 --> 32:29.378
that the targets
have been neutralized.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.748
Proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

32:38.964 --> 32:40.915
This is an evacuation alert.

32:40.966 --> 32:44.752
Please proceed immediately
to the nearest exit.

33:09.445 --> 33:10.528
I'm--

33:10.613 --> 33:13.531
I'm--I'm not sure
what I'm doing.

33:15.334 --> 33:16.618
I thought
you were an expert.

33:16.669 --> 33:19.120
I hack computers.
Not virus-releasing...

33:19.171 --> 33:21.956
Okay. Fine.
Okay. Fine.

33:22.007 --> 33:25.326
Fine.
Just--just do something.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.762
We're running out of time.
Okay. All right. All right.

33:27.829 --> 33:29.764
The timer's connected
to an actuator

33:29.832 --> 33:31.332
that opens a solenoid valve.

33:31.383 --> 33:35.603
So if I disrupt the signal
to the transducer...

33:39.808 --> 33:41.476
Ah. There.

33:41.527 --> 33:43.227
Okay, we have
to get out of here.

33:44.563 --> 33:46.013
Come on.
We have to save ourselves.

33:46.065 --> 33:48.349
There has to be--
there has to be a power source.

33:48.400 --> 33:51.018
A battery. If I can disrupt
the power to the timer--

33:51.070 --> 33:52.353
- But how?
- I don't know. I don't know.

33:52.404 --> 33:54.072
All of the components
are anchored.

33:54.156 --> 33:55.573
So if I pull the wrong wire,
everyone--

33:55.658 --> 33:57.408
Okay, Sean, we don't have time
for you to sit here

33:57.493 --> 33:59.661
and figure this out.

33:59.728 --> 34:01.696
Then go.

34:01.747 --> 34:03.464
Then you go, okay?

34:07.336 --> 34:10.388
I'm not going anywhere.
Just--just think.

34:10.472 --> 34:13.257
There's got to be something else
that will disrupt the power.

34:26.388 --> 34:30.391
Sorry. I-I panicked.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.060
It worked.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.029
Search him.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.748
I wanted
to thank you personally

34:53.815 --> 34:55.016
for everything you've done.

34:55.083 --> 34:57.085
Has there been any word
about the device

34:57.152 --> 34:58.386
at the mall?

34:58.454 --> 35:00.421
Yes. They managed
to disarm it.

35:00.489 --> 35:03.591
I'm sorry.
I should have stayed.

35:03.659 --> 35:05.960
No. If you had,
we might have lost everything.

35:06.028 --> 35:08.780
Dr. Lu has been studying
the video you filmed

35:08.864 --> 35:10.298
onboard the bus.

35:10.366 --> 35:12.200
Now that she's able
to see every minute

35:12.267 --> 35:14.068
of how the virus
affects humans

35:14.136 --> 35:17.905
as well as having
these test subjects to autopsy,

35:17.956 --> 35:19.574
we'll be able to move forward.

35:19.641 --> 35:22.810
We owe you a debt
of gratitude.

35:22.878 --> 35:25.313
Sophia, Dr. Lu needs you
in the lab.

35:25.381 --> 35:26.748
Excuse me.

35:35.090 --> 35:37.258
I think I have a way
to slow down the virus.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.676
Go on.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.361
Viruses mutate
when they jump

35:40.429 --> 35:42.463
from species to species.

35:42.531 --> 35:45.099
Like bird flu becoming H1N1

35:45.167 --> 35:46.434
when it crossed into humans.

35:46.502 --> 35:48.936
If we jump the virus
into the right species,

35:49.004 --> 35:50.521
it will mutate on its own
and we can screen

35:50.606 --> 35:52.006
for the variation we need.

35:52.074 --> 35:54.175
What kind of species
would that be?

35:54.243 --> 35:55.743
The virus
doesn't affect us at all,

35:55.811 --> 35:58.179
and it kills human beings
too quickly.

35:58.247 --> 36:00.348
We need to infect
a bridge species

36:00.416 --> 36:03.284
whose DNA lies somewhere
in-between.

36:03.352 --> 36:05.002
- A hybrid.
- Yes.

36:05.087 --> 36:08.022
And from what I understand,
we're in luck.

36:15.264 --> 36:18.266
Dr. Forest,
dial 118, please.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.919
- Give me a minute.
- Please dial 118.

36:31.012 --> 36:32.897
I was told I'm able
to see my husband now.

36:32.981 --> 36:34.215
Yes, ma'am.

36:34.283 --> 36:36.033
The order's been lifted
by order of the President.

36:43.459 --> 36:47.695
Ma'am, his vital signs
continue on a declining slope.

36:47.763 --> 36:50.031
His last E.E.G. indicated
no signs

36:50.098 --> 36:52.633
of high-functioning
brain activity.

36:52.701 --> 36:54.402
I'm sorry.
There's nothing to be done.

36:54.470 --> 36:57.205
I refuse to believe that.

36:57.272 --> 36:59.040
Mrs. Martinez,
there is just nothing--

36:59.107 --> 37:03.511
You heard me, doctor.
I refuse. Thank you.

37:03.579 --> 37:05.646
Thank you.

37:27.002 --> 37:29.604
We're gonna need something
to clear this debris!

37:37.212 --> 37:40.381
Sir.
I have something, sir.

37:42.083 --> 37:45.136
Get a team down there.
Find out where this goes now.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.289
What do you mean
"no bodies"?

37:48.357 --> 37:51.292
Reconnaissance found a tunnel
that lead to an outbuilding.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.060
They're canvassing the area.

37:53.111 --> 37:56.781
But the conclusion on the ground
is they're long gone.

38:00.469 --> 38:02.069
Mr. President.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.971
Sir, I've decrypted
the conversation

38:04.039 --> 38:06.240
between Director Sterling
and the First Lady.

38:06.308 --> 38:08.342
- Play it.
- Hello?

38:08.410 --> 38:10.344
Christina,
it's Blake Sterling.

38:10.412 --> 38:12.380
- Blake.
- We need to talk,

38:12.447 --> 38:14.114
but we can't do it
under these circumstances.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.783
I believe the phones
are monitored.

38:15.851 --> 38:18.786
Go outside. There's a pay phone
on the eastern side

38:18.854 --> 38:20.755
of the street
across from the hospital.

38:20.822 --> 38:22.156
Blake, what is it?

38:22.224 --> 38:25.459
Christina,
you have to trust me.

38:25.527 --> 38:28.396
Jarvis is behind everything
that's happened to your husband,

38:28.463 --> 38:30.398
but I have a way
to save him.

38:30.465 --> 38:33.467
I'll call you on the pay phone
in five minutes.

38:33.535 --> 38:35.870
Okay.
I'm on my way out now.

38:38.173 --> 38:40.575
She lied to me.

38:40.642 --> 38:45.913
He told her about the warehouse.
It was all a diversion.

38:48.917 --> 38:52.687
Oh. Oh, God.

38:58.844 --> 39:01.662
Give me a minute.

39:57.319 --> 40:00.237
What's going on?

40:00.322 --> 40:04.025
Carlos? Carlos, please.

40:04.092 --> 40:06.994
What is that?

40:07.062 --> 40:10.197
What is--what is that?

40:10.265 --> 40:13.451
In 1918,
the Spanish flu pandemic

40:13.535 --> 40:15.453
killed 20%
of the world's population.

40:15.537 --> 40:18.205
There were localized strains
and mutations.

40:18.273 --> 40:19.924
This is one of them.

40:20.008 --> 40:23.878
A strain so deadly,
it turned entire cities

40:23.929 --> 40:25.012
into graveyards...

40:25.080 --> 40:27.481
- No. Please.
- Overnight.

40:27.549 --> 40:29.283
Please.
Please don't do this.

40:29.351 --> 40:31.686
We worked very hard
to find this particular strain.

40:31.753 --> 40:36.157
And now you, a hybrid,
a bridge between our people...

40:36.224 --> 40:37.525
Mm. Mm.

40:37.592 --> 40:39.293
You're going to help us
spread it.
