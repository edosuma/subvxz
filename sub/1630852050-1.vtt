WEBVTT

00:40.615 --> 00:41.615
Hey.

00:42.517 --> 00:43.685
You're home early.

00:45.221 --> 00:46.221
Yes.

00:46.889 --> 00:48.791
I thought you were showing
a house today.

00:49.457 --> 00:50.692
I canceled it.

00:51.894 --> 00:54.329
Um. Is everything okay?

00:56.331 --> 00:57.432
It will be.

00:58.835 --> 00:59.835
I hope.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.772
Did something happen to Anna?

01:04.439 --> 01:05.908
No, she's fine.

01:08.743 --> 01:09.812
So...

01:11.379 --> 01:12.547
What's going on?

01:13.481 --> 01:15.051
I know about you and Vivienne.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.119
Who?

01:38.007 --> 01:40.475
- I can explain.
- I don't want to hear your explanation.

01:41.244 --> 01:42.677
I want you to listen to me.

01:45.047 --> 01:46.047
Sit down.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.763
You know, this is
not what it looks like.

02:03.132 --> 02:04.399
Sure it is.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.903
You've been fucking
a woman named Vivienne.

02:08.804 --> 02:11.406
She's one of your
creative writing students.

02:14.576 --> 02:15.945
Does she know you're married?

02:17.646 --> 02:19.315
I'm so fucking sorry.

02:19.714 --> 02:21.716
I'm gonna make this easy on you.

02:22.550 --> 02:24.186
I'm not divorcing you.

02:28.090 --> 02:32.361
I love our family and I love
the life that we've built

02:32.427 --> 02:34.562
and I'm not throwing it away.

02:35.231 --> 02:36.698
We can get therapy.

02:36.933 --> 02:37.933
First,

02:38.334 --> 02:39.936
you will never
see Vivienne again.

02:40.602 --> 02:42.637
Other than to tell her
that it's over.

02:43.505 --> 02:45.141
- Of course.
- Second...

02:46.309 --> 02:48.476
Neither of us
will mention this to Anna.

02:50.578 --> 02:54.183
Well, I agree with that.

02:54.516 --> 02:57.485
Third, we're going
on a vacation.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.824
- A what?
- A family vacation.

03:02.524 --> 03:04.759
You, me and Anna.

03:07.430 --> 03:10.532
- Okay.
- Our life, our... family,

03:10.598 --> 03:13.069
it means more to me
than anything in the world.

03:15.371 --> 03:16.571
Me too.

03:17.340 --> 03:18.340
Now...

03:19.909 --> 03:23.145
Go pick up Anna
from soccer practice, please.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.088
I still don't understand why
I have to come with you guys.

04:30.112 --> 04:32.281
'Cause you're too young
to leave at home.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.018
Are we almost there?

04:36.252 --> 04:37.386
It's a surprise.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.930
You know how I can tell
you picked this place

04:38.954 --> 04:40.356
- and not dad?
- Hmm?

04:40.655 --> 04:42.525
Because it's hot,
it's in the middle of nowhere

04:42.624 --> 04:43.624
and it's boring.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.495
You know what they say, honey.
"There are no boring places.

04:46.561 --> 04:48.596
- Only boring people."
- "Boring people."

04:49.131 --> 04:50.131
That's right.

04:50.299 --> 04:53.169
You know, if I were her age,
I wouldn't really wanna spend

04:53.235 --> 04:54.336
a week out here either.

04:54.970 --> 04:56.571
Well, thanks
for humoring me then.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.606
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I just...

04:58.673 --> 04:59.774
I'm sure you did.

05:04.046 --> 05:05.046
Hey.

05:06.315 --> 05:07.883
I... I'm trying.

05:09.151 --> 05:10.219
Try harder.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.693
Whoa.

05:22.932 --> 05:24.732
Wait until you see the pool.

05:46.122 --> 05:47.122
Holy shit.

05:47.622 --> 05:48.858
Language.

05:49.325 --> 05:52.862
No, but I mean, get real, dad.
This place is huge.

05:53.162 --> 05:54.563
This is really
where we're staying?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.799
I've been talking
about coming here for months.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.368
I even showed it to you online
and said I wanted to visit.

06:00.102 --> 06:02.872
- You don't remember, do you?
- Uh. Um.

06:03.272 --> 06:04.540
Yeah, well,

06:04.706 --> 06:06.346
the owner's selling it
and hired my agency

06:06.408 --> 06:07.443
to handle the details.

06:07.510 --> 06:08.787
It goes on the market
in a month.

06:08.811 --> 06:10.880
In the meantime,
they're letting us stay.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.581
They've been using it
as a rental.

06:12.848 --> 06:14.917
I told you that too,
but you don't remember.

06:17.685 --> 06:19.588
Who'd own a house
like this way out here?

06:20.222 --> 06:23.292
Someone very rich
and very tired of other people.

06:23.359 --> 06:24.359
Get the bags.

06:53.355 --> 06:54.423
It's beautiful.

06:55.391 --> 06:57.059
Not so boring now, is it?

06:58.227 --> 06:59.562
Is the person selling this house

06:59.628 --> 07:00.728
really old or something?

07:01.163 --> 07:04.133
To be honest, I don't know
who owns this house.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.035
It's part of a trust.

07:06.101 --> 07:07.636
Two hundred acres of land.

07:08.204 --> 07:09.848
Everything was done
through an intermediary.

07:09.872 --> 07:12.107
They specifically asked me
to handle the listing.

07:14.877 --> 07:17.079
Come on, tub tub.

07:17.346 --> 07:18.614
Hi, baby.

07:19.181 --> 07:20.616
Don't let tub tub loose outside.

07:20.748 --> 07:22.318
There are coyotes here.

07:23.385 --> 07:24.585
Oh, can I pick my own bedroom?

07:24.787 --> 07:26.322
Sure. They're upstairs.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.290
What now?

07:33.295 --> 07:35.864
I need to set up the camera
for the virtual tour.

07:36.764 --> 07:38.167
Sorry about the floor.

07:56.751 --> 08:00.256
Jesus Christ.

08:01.857 --> 08:05.060
I could use a drink.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.235
There's a store
about 20 miles up the road.

08:13.302 --> 08:14.336
I saw a sign.

08:18.807 --> 08:21.110
We can get groceries and wine.

08:22.011 --> 08:24.813
I was thinking of cooking
veal cutlets tonight.

08:26.448 --> 08:28.083
Or I could grill burgers.

08:29.451 --> 08:31.020
Anna and I hate veal.

08:36.358 --> 08:39.928
Great.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.298
Veal cutlets it is.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.571
You know,
just 'cause I messed up,

08:49.638 --> 08:50.639
don't be spiteful.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.840
Oh.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.076
I'm being spiteful?

09:01.150 --> 09:03.352
I really don't know
what the rules are anymore.

09:10.159 --> 09:12.061
Well, it was your idea
to come here.

09:12.695 --> 09:13.595
And you're lucky

09:13.662 --> 09:14.939
because the other
option's divorce

09:14.963 --> 09:17.132
and I don't think that'd
work out too well for you.

09:17.866 --> 09:19.635
Yeah, you would take Anna
and the money.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.971
- I've heard the threats before.
- Then they must be true.

09:26.141 --> 09:27.176
I hate this.

09:29.578 --> 09:30.578
Same.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.418
You know what?
I need a drink too.

09:37.653 --> 09:38.954
Go get food and wine.

09:43.926 --> 09:46.995
Anna, come on.
Mom wants us to run an errand.

09:47.396 --> 09:50.399
- Oh, come on, I'm having fun.
- Yeah, I know.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.869
Yeah, here.

10:04.446 --> 10:05.514
Need a little help.

10:45.921 --> 10:49.124
Wow.

10:53.128 --> 10:55.731
Looks like we're
the city slickers around here.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.733
We're city slickers
everywhere, dad.

11:03.572 --> 11:05.809
- What? You're not gonna help me shop?
- Sorry, dad.

11:06.141 --> 11:07.981
Vintage fashion magazines
are more interesting.

11:08.343 --> 11:09.663
- Oh.
- What do you want me to do?

11:09.813 --> 11:11.313
Okay.

11:47.316 --> 11:48.317
Hey.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.585
What you reading?

11:51.687 --> 11:52.687
Nothing.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.590
Where you from?

11:56.893 --> 11:57.993
Houston.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.129
Wow. That far?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.568
My name's Isaac.

12:09.638 --> 12:10.638
I'm Anna.

12:12.508 --> 12:13.242
You know what, Anna?

12:13.342 --> 12:15.344
You look a lot
like my ex-girlfriend.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.413
- I do?
- Yeah.

12:19.081 --> 12:20.315
Way cuter, though.

12:24.586 --> 12:26.121
Where are you
and your dad staying?

12:26.255 --> 12:27.456
I saw you come in with him.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.258
My mom's here with us too.

12:30.860 --> 12:32.127
They're not getting along.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.462
They mean to you?

12:34.831 --> 12:36.198
No. They're fine.

12:37.366 --> 12:41.503
Um. We're staying at this big,
old house on the water

12:41.804 --> 12:43.105
in the middle of nowhere.

12:44.239 --> 12:46.809
I think I know it.
Uh. About 20 miles east?

12:47.676 --> 12:51.246
Yeah, I think so. My dad drove.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.148
So...

12:54.650 --> 12:55.650
How old are you?

12:56.618 --> 12:57.619
I'm almost 15.

12:58.955 --> 13:01.490
Really? You look a lot older.

13:09.398 --> 13:11.099
We should get
some ice cream sometime.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.369
I'm 18. I'll drive.

13:30.019 --> 13:31.753
- Who were you talking to?
- Hmm?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.322
You making friends over there?

13:33.823 --> 13:34.857
Shut up.

13:38.027 --> 13:40.262
- Register's broken.
- Uh-huh.

13:43.599 --> 13:44.766
Hey.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.879
You wanna help me
bag these things up?

13:46.903 --> 13:47.903
Yeah.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.174
You know, your mom said
you'd like it here.

13:52.774 --> 13:54.576
Didn't she also say to get veal?

13:55.210 --> 13:56.578
Well, they didn't have any.

14:01.249 --> 14:03.318
Oh, look at this.

14:04.419 --> 14:05.419
Pop rocks.

14:05.721 --> 14:06.721
Those are nasty.

14:06.956 --> 14:08.801
What are you talking about?
You used to love these things.

14:08.825 --> 14:10.525
Yeah, when I was like ten.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.900
- Come on, dad.
- Hey, you know what?

14:13.695 --> 14:14.695
Add those.

14:15.631 --> 14:16.631
All right.

14:17.265 --> 14:19.836
Comes to 58 dollars
and six cents.

14:21.436 --> 14:22.604
That is 60.

14:23.605 --> 14:24.605
Keep the change.

14:28.477 --> 14:29.477
Thank you.

14:30.178 --> 14:31.580
Oh, here, you got it.

14:41.223 --> 14:42.391
Dad, you okay?

14:46.996 --> 14:48.163
Um.

14:50.332 --> 14:52.300
Did that old guy
seem odd to you?

14:53.335 --> 14:54.804
No, I don't think so. Why?

14:55.671 --> 14:58.340
Maybe there's somewhere
closer to the house we can shop.

14:58.507 --> 15:00.375
Oh, I don't mind
if we have to come back here.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.565
- Dad.
- Yeah?

15:23.632 --> 15:26.201
- I got a weird question.
- Shoot.

15:28.203 --> 15:30.372
Is everything okay
with you and mom?

15:32.008 --> 15:33.375
Okay in what way?

15:33.775 --> 15:34.844
Don't do that.

15:35.011 --> 15:36.311
- Don't...
- Don't deflect.

15:36.378 --> 15:39.414
That's what mom does.
Can you just be honest?

15:41.184 --> 15:42.584
Marriage is really hard work.

15:42.718 --> 15:45.822
And sometimes, it doesn't go
in the direction you hoped.

15:47.723 --> 15:49.624
- Are you guys getting a divorce?
- No.

15:49.725 --> 15:51.593
- No. No, no, no.
- Don't have to freak out.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.695
- It's fine. I don't care.
- Who's freaking out?

15:53.762 --> 15:56.199
It's just, like, all my friends'
parents are divorced.

15:56.264 --> 15:57.308
- Listen.
- It's not a big deal.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.434
- I...
- Let's not think like that, okay?

15:59.802 --> 16:00.502
Well...

16:00.702 --> 16:03.405
I love you both.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.175
- I just want you to know.
- Good.

16:06.775 --> 16:08.744
You know,
sometimes I think to myself,

16:09.078 --> 16:11.214
"how did I get
such a wise daughter?"

16:11.646 --> 16:13.615
And then I think,

16:14.217 --> 16:16.551
"wow, she probably has
a really wise dad."

16:16.853 --> 16:18.587
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:18.921 --> 16:20.255
Get out.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.165
Maybe Toby needs a friend.

16:29.464 --> 16:30.632
That'd be awesome.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.005
- Mom?
- Jess?

16:36.072 --> 16:38.107
Mom?

16:38.207 --> 16:41.676
Jess?

16:45.514 --> 16:46.748
Mom?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.185
This... this fucking thing
won't open.

16:49.351 --> 16:50.352
Language.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.587
- Door won't open?
- No, a manhole cover

16:52.654 --> 16:54.623
in lower Manhattan.
Yes, the door.

16:56.458 --> 16:58.795
I have to get inside
for the virtual tour.

16:58.995 --> 17:00.129
But don't you have a key?

17:00.362 --> 17:02.731
Yeah, to the house,
the... the pool shed,

17:02.799 --> 17:04.533
the mailbox,
but not for this door.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.868
Jess, let... let me help.

17:05.935 --> 17:06.935
Let me give it a shot.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.843
Okay.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.087
Yeah, that thing's not opening.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.322
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to kick it down?

17:27.622 --> 17:30.325
Hmm. Not yet.

17:31.127 --> 17:32.127
Did you get the veal?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.130
They didn't have any.

17:34.362 --> 17:35.898
So, what did you get instead?

17:36.531 --> 17:39.434
Burger meat for grilling.

17:40.535 --> 17:41.770
Let me see something.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.546
No sunlight gets in.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.415
That's weird.

17:58.054 --> 18:00.388
This room
wasn't on the blueprint.

18:01.356 --> 18:04.392
I... I think it's,
like, a storage room

18:04.459 --> 18:07.662
or maybe a... a panic room.

18:10.032 --> 18:11.766
Freaky.

18:15.905 --> 18:17.372
I'll get it.

18:30.286 --> 18:31.286
Can I help you?

18:31.320 --> 18:32.654
Yeah. So you're Anna's mom.

18:33.789 --> 18:34.789
Who's asking?

18:34.824 --> 18:36.691
Oh, I'm Isaac.
I'm... I'm a friend.

18:37.260 --> 18:38.294
A friend of Anna's?

18:38.895 --> 18:41.063
I met her at my grandpappy's
grocery store today.

18:41.130 --> 18:42.530
Uh-huh. And?

18:42.832 --> 18:44.766
Well, I was just stopping
to invite you

18:44.834 --> 18:46.836
and your family to dinner.

18:46.903 --> 18:49.205
We're your nearest neighbors,
just a few miles that way.

18:49.604 --> 18:51.473
That's very sweet of you, Isaac.

18:51.539 --> 18:52.674
Um.

18:53.109 --> 18:54.509
I'm sorry, we have other plans.

18:54.777 --> 18:57.579
We're on a family vacation.
I'm sure you understand.

18:57.646 --> 19:00.415
I do. I do.
But if you change your mind,

19:00.615 --> 19:01.793
we're having
veal cutlets tonight.

19:01.817 --> 19:03.185
We got a lot in at the store.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.923
Veal cutlets, at your store?

19:07.023 --> 19:07.722
Yes, ma'am.

19:07.957 --> 19:09.557
W... we got a huge
shipment in yesterday.

19:09.825 --> 19:11.827
They're on display.
No one could miss 'em.

19:14.763 --> 19:16.365
Give me your address, Isaac.

19:16.765 --> 19:19.567
On second thought,
we would love to join you.

19:48.763 --> 19:49.899
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

19:50.232 --> 19:51.334
I didn't see it.

19:51.867 --> 19:55.104
Or maybe he's lying
about the stupid cutlets.

19:55.470 --> 19:57.239
He's not lying. You are.

19:57.807 --> 20:00.176
Why would you trust
some stranger over me?

20:02.477 --> 20:04.080
I didn't wanna say anything...

20:06.315 --> 20:07.917
But the old man at the store...

20:09.684 --> 20:11.686
- He wrote this on my receipt.
- Hmm.

20:12.922 --> 20:14.857
"You're being watched
by the devil."

20:16.826 --> 20:19.594
- He's probably making a joke or...
- I don't wanna have dinner

20:19.661 --> 20:22.264
with some creepy locals
just so you can prove a point.

20:22.431 --> 20:23.698
Well... neither do I.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.835
Okay, then.
Would you knock this stuff off?

20:25.901 --> 20:28.904
- Come on. You are beautiful.
- What is wrong with you?

20:30.039 --> 20:31.719
Why couldn't you buy
the veal like I asked?

20:31.773 --> 20:34.576
- I am telling you, I didn't see it.
- Sure you did.

20:34.676 --> 20:37.013
But you hate veal,
so you didn't buy it.

20:37.079 --> 20:39.015
Because you do
exactly what you want

20:39.081 --> 20:40.648
and damn the consequences.

20:41.917 --> 20:43.853
You're not just
talking about veal.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.055
Wow, what a genius you are.

20:50.259 --> 20:53.561
You know, Anna hates veal too.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.332
But you never think about her.

20:56.698 --> 20:59.402
She's all I think about.

20:59.468 --> 21:00.469
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:00.735 --> 21:03.172
I think she would be
very surprised to hear that.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.573
So, now, I'm a bad parent?
Not you?

21:05.740 --> 21:08.177
N... not the cheater.
Never you. No, no, no.

21:09.577 --> 21:12.048
You're the nice one
and I'm the asshole.

21:12.448 --> 21:13.482
Isn't that right?

21:14.050 --> 21:15.951
Isn't that how
you try to manipulate Anna

21:16.018 --> 21:17.286
into seeing us?

21:17.787 --> 21:20.356
I'm not gonna stay here
and get emotionally abused.

21:20.588 --> 21:21.756
Then go to your whore.

21:22.024 --> 21:23.926
You know, at least
she made me feel good

21:23.993 --> 21:24.993
about myself.

21:25.094 --> 21:27.662
You make me feel
like slitting my wrists.

21:31.566 --> 21:33.335
Then fucking do it.

21:34.736 --> 21:38.706
You... broke my heart.

21:38.773 --> 21:41.143
Oh, my god.

21:51.287 --> 21:55.657
I loved you. I love you.

21:56.559 --> 21:59.061
- I'm your wife.
- I know.

22:00.429 --> 22:01.763
How could you
treat me like this?

22:01.831 --> 22:04.133
How can you do this to us?

22:04.400 --> 22:05.667
You're right. I am sorry.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.403
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

22:09.905 --> 22:11.673
Did you end things
with that woman?

22:11.807 --> 22:14.276
Yes. It's over
between me and Vivienne.

22:15.144 --> 22:16.879
Do you swear it?

22:18.147 --> 22:19.647
On Anna's life.

22:21.317 --> 22:22.852
Because this is why...

22:23.751 --> 22:26.021
- I brought us here.
- I...

22:26.621 --> 22:28.958
I didn't want you
to sneak off to go see her.

22:29.024 --> 22:33.963
I... I wanted you to give us
a chance to rebuild.

22:34.230 --> 22:35.264
I'm gonna get help.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.402
I just... oh, my god.

22:41.470 --> 22:43.038
It's hard to trust you.

22:43.638 --> 22:47.510
You just keep hurting me...
Over and over.

22:47.610 --> 22:49.145
I'm so sorry.

22:50.045 --> 22:52.281
I want things to be
like they used to.

22:52.348 --> 22:53.382
Mm-hmm.

22:54.649 --> 22:56.085
We're gonna be okay.

22:57.386 --> 22:58.387
We're gonna be okay.

23:21.343 --> 23:23.212
Mom! Dad!

23:25.447 --> 23:26.582
Wow.

23:26.681 --> 23:27.950
- Are you okay, hon?
- Yeah.

23:28.017 --> 23:29.952
I think it's finally stopping.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.422
You know, it happens
when she gets stressed.

23:33.989 --> 23:36.724
How do I look?

23:37.526 --> 23:40.629
Like a supermodel who
got punched in the nose.

23:41.564 --> 23:43.532
At least we have a reason
to stay home tonight.

23:43.899 --> 23:47.145
- Yeah, well, that boy didn't give me a number to call and cancel.
- His name is Isaac.

23:47.169 --> 23:49.572
- Who cares if we don't call and cancel?
- His name's Isaac.

23:50.172 --> 23:51.640
We can't just stand him...

23:51.706 --> 23:52.746
And his grandfather up,

23:52.808 --> 23:54.248
especially if they're
cooking a meal.

23:54.543 --> 23:57.780
- Okay, well...
- Like, what if they mess with the house when we leave?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.983
I'll go to the store
in the morning and apologize.

24:02.785 --> 24:04.863
I don't want Isaac to see me
with a bloody nose, mom.

24:04.887 --> 24:07.189
- I know, honey.
- What if it happens again?

24:09.124 --> 24:11.460
- Okay.
- We can have a nice dinner.

24:12.727 --> 24:14.063
Just the three of us.

24:19.235 --> 24:20.869
Oh. One minute!

24:38.954 --> 24:40.356
Hi there, Anna's mom and dad.

24:40.789 --> 24:42.791
- What are you doing here?
- I'm real sorry.

24:42.858 --> 24:44.603
I... I know you were supposed
to come to our place,

24:44.627 --> 24:46.195
but the strangest
thing happened.

24:46.295 --> 24:48.063
- What's that?
- Our oven died.

24:48.931 --> 24:50.833
- Seriously?
- Yeah. So,

24:51.100 --> 24:52.334
we did the next best thing.

24:52.601 --> 24:54.601
We just brought the food
over here to cook for you.

24:55.170 --> 24:57.273
It's... it's in the truck
with my grandpappy.

24:57.373 --> 24:58.373
Hmm.

24:58.474 --> 25:02.478
Uh. Veal cutlets,
onions, carrots, grits.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.513
Grandpappy sure can cook.

25:05.047 --> 25:06.915
Uh. We even brought
a bottle of wine.

25:08.417 --> 25:10.419
It... it's just how
we do things on the bayou.

25:12.121 --> 25:13.722
- Hmm.
- So, can we come in?

25:13.989 --> 25:15.958
Uh. We'll even do dishes.

25:17.860 --> 25:20.529
Ye... yes,
uh, of course you can.

25:21.096 --> 25:23.699
Hey, grandpappy,
they said it's okay to come in!

25:28.404 --> 25:29.404
Great.

25:29.538 --> 25:30.538
Come on in.

25:52.428 --> 25:53.428
Thanks for cooking.

25:53.696 --> 25:55.030
It's no big deal.

25:57.199 --> 25:58.199
My name's John.

26:01.870 --> 26:03.672
You know,
about that note you wrote me,

26:03.772 --> 26:05.140
the one on the receipt.

26:05.674 --> 26:06.674
I remember.

26:07.943 --> 26:09.211
What did you mean by that?

26:11.914 --> 26:13.916
Get me a measuring cup.

26:19.988 --> 26:21.156
The little one.

26:25.361 --> 26:26.462
Sometimes...

26:27.863 --> 26:31.900
When a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

26:32.534 --> 26:33.602
I don't understand.

26:34.370 --> 26:35.370
Are you sure?

26:39.007 --> 26:41.477
The devil is watching us
all the time.

26:42.745 --> 26:44.413
Some of us invite him in.

26:45.314 --> 26:46.314
Some don't.

26:47.116 --> 26:49.485
I felt you needed
to hear those words, but...

26:51.286 --> 26:53.389
Didn't want to say 'em
in front of your daughter.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.393
Well, no offense, but I don't
believe in the devil.

27:01.196 --> 27:02.898
The devil believes in you.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.035
Thanks. I appreciate that.

27:20.983 --> 27:22.050
His name's Toby.

27:22.251 --> 27:24.653
We call him tub tub.
He likes you.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.289
Cats can sense things
people can't.

27:31.527 --> 27:34.363
Come on, tub tub.
Yeah, there you go.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.067
Is that thing on?

27:40.502 --> 27:41.502
No.

27:42.938 --> 27:44.808
So, you were saying
it's just you

27:44.874 --> 27:46.408
and your grandfather out here?

27:46.876 --> 27:49.678
Yes, ma'am.
My parents died some time ago.

27:49.813 --> 27:51.213
He raised me as his own.

27:52.181 --> 27:54.149
- How'd your parents die?
- Anna.

27:54.516 --> 27:55.684
Don't. It's rude.

27:56.051 --> 27:58.654
It's fine.
I would be curious too.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.556
Uh. They died of bone cancer.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.425
- Both of them?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:04.226 --> 28:06.762
Grandpappy says bone cancer's
the most painful way to die.

28:07.429 --> 28:10.165
But he says
a lot of crazy things.

28:10.532 --> 28:11.567
He's a wild one.

28:13.135 --> 28:15.637
What are the schools
like around here?

28:16.371 --> 28:18.207
Why? Are you wanting
to move here with Anna?

28:18.740 --> 28:19.740
No.

28:20.275 --> 28:22.211
I wouldn't
know much about schools.

28:23.045 --> 28:24.781
Grandpappy taught me
everything I know.

28:25.314 --> 28:26.783
But I'm gonna run
the store one day.

28:27.115 --> 28:28.283
That's so cool.

28:28.818 --> 28:29.985
You really think so?

28:30.986 --> 28:31.986
Yeah.

28:32.221 --> 28:34.490
I... I like your shirt.
It matches your eyes.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.991
How old are you, Isaac?

28:36.525 --> 28:39.194
Eighteen. I'm trying
to grow a beard.

28:39.261 --> 28:40.529
Hmm.

28:42.364 --> 28:44.166
Who owns this house?
Do you know?

28:45.467 --> 28:48.370
I don't know much about 'em.
They're never really here.

28:48.737 --> 28:49.737
Really?

28:51.206 --> 28:53.475
But being your closest neighbor,
I'd think you'd know.

28:54.510 --> 28:57.079
Hey, everybody,
dinner is almost ready

28:57.145 --> 28:58.680
and it looks delicious.

29:07.589 --> 29:08.589
This is great.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.727
You are one hell of a cook.

29:14.263 --> 29:16.064
There's nothing
my grandpappy can't do.

29:17.399 --> 29:19.167
I bet your mom's
a hell of a cook too.

29:22.304 --> 29:23.304
Um.

29:24.807 --> 29:26.876
- She's, uh...
- No. That's okay, sweetie.

29:26.943 --> 29:30.013
Uh. Cooking isn't my forte.

29:30.078 --> 29:32.481
It's just,
I never got interested in it.

29:32.982 --> 29:35.217
Out here,
cooking isn't an interest.

29:36.685 --> 29:37.719
It's a necessity.

29:40.489 --> 29:42.157
We don't have
restaurants for miles.

29:42.859 --> 29:44.526
You don't cook, you don't eat.

29:45.627 --> 29:48.363
I know how to cook, Isaac.
It's just, uh,

29:48.730 --> 29:50.165
not a passion of mine.

29:51.567 --> 29:52.567
Hmm.

29:53.101 --> 29:54.536
Everyone's got their passion.

30:00.509 --> 30:02.244
Would you mind
if I light some candles?

30:02.711 --> 30:04.546
No, uh...

30:06.748 --> 30:07.749
That would be nice.

30:26.101 --> 30:28.071
- Isaac.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:28.570 --> 30:30.405
How did you know
where the candles are?

30:31.841 --> 30:34.142
Lucky guess.

30:34.710 --> 30:35.710
I'll be.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.221
I guess cats
aren't the only ones

30:37.245 --> 30:38.380
who can sense things.

30:49.491 --> 30:52.327
Pretty funny thing to say, huh, grandpappy?

30:58.901 --> 31:00.268
Gosh, you know...

31:01.938 --> 31:04.139
Uh, I don't have any matches.

31:05.108 --> 31:06.174
Oh, um...

31:06.541 --> 31:08.176
I'll find some
in the kitchen.

31:08.276 --> 31:10.612
John, come help me look.

31:20.089 --> 31:21.529
I want these people
out of the house.

31:21.723 --> 31:23.358
Look. Listen, they're weird,

31:23.425 --> 31:25.260
but they haven't done
anything wrong exactly.

31:25.327 --> 31:27.629
That creepy boy is looking
at Anna in a way I don't like.

31:27.729 --> 31:29.574
- Right.
- And how did he know where the candles are?

31:29.598 --> 31:31.199
Okay, listen,
we will finish dinner

31:31.266 --> 31:33.102
and then we will tell them
we're going to bed.

31:33.168 --> 31:34.328
Can't we get them out faster?

31:34.603 --> 31:36.843
Hey, you're the one that said
we shouldn't piss them off.

31:38.273 --> 31:39.474
Fine.

31:39.641 --> 31:42.711
I... I want them gone
the minute we finish eating.

31:43.245 --> 31:44.881
I don't want Anna
alone with them.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.784
Oh, shit, uh,
we forgot the matches.

31:47.884 --> 31:49.884
Here, come on. I'll tell
them we couldn't find 'em.

31:51.921 --> 31:54.322
Mom, dad, Isaac just did
something really cool.

31:54.857 --> 31:57.759
- What, he found matches?
- No, he touched the candles with his finger

31:57.827 --> 32:00.362
and they just lit up.
Can you do that trick again?

32:00.462 --> 32:02.965
Oh, I'll show you
a lot more tricks, Anna.

32:06.368 --> 32:09.204
Isaac, um,
John and I were talking

32:09.271 --> 32:12.708
and we're grateful for the meal,

32:13.076 --> 32:15.243
but we're really tired
after the drive

32:15.310 --> 32:18.447
and we're going to bed early,
right after dinner.

32:18.714 --> 32:21.249
And I... I just wanted you
and your grandpa to know.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.352
Wow, grandpappy. You hear that?

32:24.519 --> 32:26.055
They're inviting us
to stay the night.

32:26.155 --> 32:28.157
- No, I... I... I...
- We're touched, ma'am.

32:28.623 --> 32:31.760
No one's ever invited us to stay
in a house like this before.

32:34.663 --> 32:37.834
I... I'm not inviting you
to stay the night. I'm...

32:38.935 --> 32:41.703
I'm saying that
you have to leave after dinner,

32:42.604 --> 32:43.705
if not sooner.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.441
But we brought
ice cream for dessert.

32:47.076 --> 32:48.710
Well, we'll eat it
when you're gone.

32:52.115 --> 32:53.115
Oh, come on.

32:53.749 --> 32:54.749
What did we do?

32:55.517 --> 32:57.820
I know there's enough room
in this house for all of us.

32:58.121 --> 33:00.123
Six bedrooms,
if I'm not mistaken.

33:00.622 --> 33:02.390
That's not counting
the game room

33:03.059 --> 33:04.292
or the bonus room...

33:05.560 --> 33:07.763
Or even that locked room
you can't get into.

33:08.663 --> 33:10.298
How do you know
about the locked room?

33:10.732 --> 33:12.101
How do you think?

33:12.334 --> 33:13.903
You've been
in this house before.

33:14.469 --> 33:16.505
Oh, girl, you got a gusher.

33:19.008 --> 33:20.542
Mom, I don't feel good.

33:22.178 --> 33:24.046
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

33:24.346 --> 33:27.516
- Whoa. Come on. Anna, Anna.
- Oh. Get her.

33:28.251 --> 33:29.852
Oh, for Christ sakes.

33:30.086 --> 33:31.620
I gotta use your pisser.

33:33.321 --> 33:35.024
- Anna.
- Hey, baby?

33:35.557 --> 33:37.994
- Let's get her in the living room, okay?
- Okay.

33:41.696 --> 33:42.799
Anna.

33:43.365 --> 33:46.701
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Wake up. Wake up. Hey.

33:47.170 --> 33:48.170
Hey.

33:49.138 --> 33:51.773
Hey, are you okay? Are you okay?

33:54.743 --> 33:55.743
Hey, sweetie.

33:56.212 --> 33:58.014
- Can you hear my voice?
- Can you hear me?

33:58.080 --> 34:00.749
- Your mom's here. I'm here.
- You're okay.

34:01.884 --> 34:02.884
Mom.

34:04.987 --> 34:06.388
What happ... what happened?

34:06.588 --> 34:09.391
You fainted.
You had another nosebleed.

34:14.297 --> 34:15.530
I have to wash my face.

34:15.798 --> 34:17.934
Oh, it's fine.
I've seen blood before.

34:18.333 --> 34:20.236
- Much more than that.
- You need to leave.

34:20.602 --> 34:21.922
I'm not sure
you want that, ma'am.

34:22.071 --> 34:25.007
She's very sure.
Our daughter isn't feeling well.

34:25.074 --> 34:26.142
Dad, I'm fine.

34:26.242 --> 34:27.552
- No, hey. Isaac...
- No, you're not.

34:27.576 --> 34:29.444
Enough is enough. Come on.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.282
It can take
grandpappy a little bit.

34:33.348 --> 34:34.951
Sometimes he gets the squirts.

34:35.151 --> 34:37.153
- Then go wait in the truck.
- Mom.

34:37.452 --> 34:38.653
- It's okay.
- Wow.

34:39.789 --> 34:42.457
I feel like your cat's
the only one that likes me here.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.560
You cook veal cutlets
for strangers

34:45.627 --> 34:47.063
and this is the thanks you get?

34:49.232 --> 34:51.499
You like me though,
don't you, Anna?

34:52.367 --> 34:53.468
I can tell.

34:55.104 --> 34:57.139
- The way a woman likes a man.
- Stop it!

34:57.372 --> 34:59.175
You're done here,
Isaac. Get out.

34:59.242 --> 35:01.878
I knew you'd have problems
getting into that locked room.

35:02.912 --> 35:03.913
It's the only key.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.955
I think my grandpappy's
tangling with your cat.

35:13.222 --> 35:14.422
Toby?

35:15.523 --> 35:17.226
Wait. Wait.

35:17.293 --> 35:18.794
Toby.

35:21.463 --> 35:23.423
- Toby! Toby!
- What the hell is going on in here?

35:23.531 --> 35:24.651
- Did you hurt our cat?
- No!

35:24.967 --> 35:26.233
- Open the door.
- I was just looking for the bathroom.

35:26.235 --> 35:27.355
- That door was open.
- Toby!

35:27.402 --> 35:29.372
- The cat ran inside.
- Toby.

35:30.006 --> 35:32.942
Now, I may have
closed it by accident.

35:33.209 --> 35:35.410
You're lying. This door
has been locked the entire time.

35:35.778 --> 35:37.646
Grandpappy never lies.

35:37.746 --> 35:41.150
- Toby. Toby.
- Wait, you have a key to the room too?

35:42.318 --> 35:44.353
Toby, Toby, Toby!

35:44.419 --> 35:45.754
Give me the key.

35:46.022 --> 35:47.022
Give it to me.

35:47.422 --> 35:48.982
- Toby! Toby!
- Give me the fucking key!

35:49.025 --> 35:50.159
- This key?
- Yeah!

35:50.393 --> 35:51.553
- Just give it to me.
- Jesus.

35:51.693 --> 35:54.931
Grandpappy, he's hurting me.

35:59.302 --> 36:00.502
See, John?

36:00.803 --> 36:02.504
- Told you I'd show you some tricks.
- Huh?

36:02.737 --> 36:05.007
What's going on?

36:08.443 --> 36:09.845
Good thing we have candles.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.218
Anna, honey, are you okay?

36:16.551 --> 36:18.453
Take your grandson
and get out of here.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.356
- He's not my grandson.
- What?

36:20.689 --> 36:22.425
What do you mean, he's not your grandson?

36:22.490 --> 36:24.592
I mean, he's not my grandson.

36:24.659 --> 36:25.895
All right.

36:25.962 --> 36:27.638
All right, you know what?
Just give me the key.

36:27.662 --> 36:29.822
We're gonna take our cat
and I'm gonna call the police.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.576
- Something's hurting Toby, dad!
- Okay, calm down.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.711
- Something's hurting him!
- Calm down.

36:33.735 --> 36:34.937
Do something, dad.

36:35.004 --> 36:37.306
Can't just open it up.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.275
Toby.

36:39.474 --> 36:41.277
Oh, my god.

36:49.819 --> 36:51.988
Is Toby dead?

36:52.487 --> 36:54.756
Listen, give me the key!

36:55.657 --> 36:56.959
Check your back pocket.

36:58.995 --> 37:00.196
Jesus Christ.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.100
I'll be.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.280
- I'm opening it.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop!

37:07.336 --> 37:08.902
- John, John, John, please. You have to stop.
- I'm opening the door.

37:08.904 --> 37:10.048
- Please stop. We heard...
- I'm opening the door.

37:10.072 --> 37:11.673
- There's something in there.
- Mom,

37:11.740 --> 37:13.517
- Toby's in there!
- There is something... I know,

37:13.541 --> 37:14.981
but there
is something else in there.

37:15.044 --> 37:16.721
- We all heard it. Please don't...
- Could be a coyote went in there,

37:16.745 --> 37:18.280
you know, when the door opened.

37:18.580 --> 37:19.815
Oh, coyote.

37:19.915 --> 37:21.784
Now, that is bad news
for tub tub.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.452
No, no. Enough's enough!

37:23.518 --> 37:25.587
- I'm opening the damn door!
- No, please don't!

37:25.653 --> 37:26.932
- Don't open the door.
- Back off!

37:26.956 --> 37:28.800
Are you out of your mind?
Please, John, let's...

37:28.824 --> 37:30.059
- Come on!
- Let us go.

37:30.192 --> 37:32.004
- Let's go.
- Open the door. Dad, open the door.

37:32.028 --> 37:33.996
Damn, I must have brought
the wrong key.

37:36.765 --> 37:37.800
Can we go, please?

37:38.467 --> 37:41.804
- Can we go? Oh, my god.
- Mom, we can't go! We can't just leave Toby, mom!

37:42.004 --> 37:43.571
Listen to me. It's a cat.

37:43.638 --> 37:44.940
We will buy another cat.

37:45.007 --> 37:46.308
We will.

37:46.442 --> 37:48.144
Grandpappy,
did you find that bathroom?

37:48.576 --> 37:50.455
- We have to get out of here.
- Yeah. Through there.

37:50.479 --> 37:52.114
Of course. I remember now.

37:53.282 --> 37:54.950
Uh. Sorry about your cat.

37:55.683 --> 37:56.886
Fuck you.

37:59.687 --> 38:02.191
Listen,
you need to come with me.

38:02.391 --> 38:04.659
We need to talk
before Isaac gets back.

38:05.094 --> 38:06.829
Follow me.

38:06.896 --> 38:07.963
Come here. Come here.

38:08.230 --> 38:09.631
We have to go. We have to go.

38:11.867 --> 38:14.203
<i>So, are you robbing us?
Is that what's going on?</i>

38:14.669 --> 38:17.672
You ain't got nothing
we need or want.

38:18.174 --> 38:19.208
Then why are you here?

38:20.376 --> 38:21.609
Like I told him...

38:23.179 --> 38:26.714
When a man does bad things,
it opens up a door.

38:26.849 --> 38:29.085
You are nuts and so is that kid.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.153
Bad things?

38:31.220 --> 38:32.354
Bad things like what?

38:33.456 --> 38:34.589
Like lying.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.357
Cheating.

38:37.493 --> 38:38.493
Murder.

38:38.828 --> 38:40.996
- Ain't you read your <i>Bible?</i>
- Oh, god.

38:42.064 --> 38:44.400
In the store,
Isaac was so nice to me.

38:45.434 --> 38:47.870
He said I looked like his ex-girlfriend.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.339
Now, he's being so mean.

38:50.705 --> 38:52.942
Yeah, well...

38:53.409 --> 38:55.044
That's Isaac in a nutshell.

38:55.978 --> 38:58.180
If Isaac isn't your grandson,

38:58.347 --> 38:59.381
then who is he?

39:00.916 --> 39:04.787
He just
sort of appeared one summer.

39:05.653 --> 39:07.156
Walked right out of the bayou.

39:08.858 --> 39:12.627
Said his parents had died,
left him a bunch of money.

39:15.030 --> 39:18.633
Never even told me
his last name.

39:20.970 --> 39:23.205
But he didn't have
no place to live.

39:24.607 --> 39:26.242
Didn't have no possessions.

39:28.043 --> 39:30.813
So I kinda, sorta, took him in.

39:31.347 --> 39:33.115
- You took him in?
- Stop!

39:34.850 --> 39:36.418
I'm not done talking.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.360
He ain't got no education...

39:45.828 --> 39:47.963
But he's got
a good Christian spirit.

39:51.200 --> 39:55.437
I... I guess
I'm his helpmate, so to speak.

39:55.538 --> 39:56.839
Oh, god.

39:57.573 --> 39:58.908
How long has he lived with you?

39:59.275 --> 40:01.877
It's hard telling.
You lose track of time

40:02.278 --> 40:03.445
out on the bayou.

40:04.246 --> 40:07.349
Few years, maybe.

40:08.617 --> 40:09.652
Maybe decades.

40:09.818 --> 40:11.220
There's no way.

40:13.688 --> 40:14.790
Thing is...

40:16.025 --> 40:18.260
He don't never seem
to get any older.

40:19.895 --> 40:22.264
He's good with those damn
magic tricks, though, isn't he?

40:23.599 --> 40:25.401
But he always looks
the same to me.

40:25.668 --> 40:26.869
Maybe 18 or so.

40:27.069 --> 40:28.703
- This is bullshit.
- Just let him talk.

40:28.804 --> 40:30.406
- No, it's bullshit!
- Let him talk!

40:33.108 --> 40:35.044
I'd like to put some music on.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.880
Make sure Isaac can't hear.

40:39.515 --> 40:41.016
I got something else
to tell you.

41:05.874 --> 41:06.994
<i>So, what are you telling me?</i>

41:07.142 --> 41:08.286
<i>You telling me that
she found out about us?</i>

41:08.310 --> 41:09.310
<i>I wasn't careful enough.</i>

41:09.878 --> 41:12.514
<i>I was so stupid about it.
Yes, she followed me, okay?</i>

41:12.581 --> 41:13.649
<i>I just found out about it.</i>

41:14.083 --> 41:16.328
- <i>She could be watching us right now.</i>
- Well, that ain't the song

41:16.352 --> 41:18.096
- I was looking for.
- <i>I can't believe she knows.</i>

41:18.120 --> 41:20.189
<i>She's dragging me
on a trip with Anna. I...</i>

41:20.623 --> 41:23.225
- What is this? Wh... what is this?
- <i>God, I fucked this up.</i>

41:23.392 --> 41:25.928
<i>- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm telling you,</i>

41:26.262 --> 41:27.429
she is vicious.

41:28.864 --> 41:31.500
You have no idea.

41:31.734 --> 41:33.269
I have to be
more careful from now on.

41:33.502 --> 41:36.872
Everything will be different
when I get back, Vivienne.

41:37.039 --> 41:38.974
I will file the divorce papers,

41:39.041 --> 41:40.876
and we can start
our new life together.

41:41.010 --> 41:44.146
- No, no, no, no!
- Yes, yes.

41:44.413 --> 41:45.414
- No.
- Yes.

41:45.481 --> 41:47.049
- Come on.
- It's okay.

41:48.684 --> 41:50.819
Jessica, please.

41:50.886 --> 41:53.956
- I don't know what's going on right now.
- <i>I love you so much.</i>

41:54.723 --> 41:56.125
<i>I love you more.</i>

42:08.971 --> 42:10.239
How did you get that?

42:10.372 --> 42:12.741
- I think it's one of Isaac's magic tricks.
- Listen.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.243
Fuck your magic.

42:14.543 --> 42:16.045
Was that real?

42:16.145 --> 42:17.880
That was real. That was real.

42:17.946 --> 42:20.149
So, you've been seeing Vivienne.

42:20.849 --> 42:23.185
Yeah? Yeah?

42:23.886 --> 42:26.422
And you... you...
You're going to... to...

42:27.389 --> 42:29.024
You're going to divorce me?

42:30.559 --> 42:31.593
I... no.

42:31.994 --> 42:34.129
I said that to her,
but I didn't mean it.

42:35.664 --> 42:36.899
My god.

42:36.965 --> 42:39.134
You've been playing
both of us this entire time

42:39.201 --> 42:40.636
and you've been lying to me.

42:41.003 --> 42:42.404
I can't believe this.

42:42.638 --> 42:44.673
No, hey, listen,
don't get emotional.

42:44.873 --> 42:46.375
I can get however I want.

42:46.508 --> 42:50.279
- Not in front of Anna.
- Not in front of Anna? You're a piece of shit.

42:51.914 --> 42:53.549
Dad, are you leaving me and mom?

43:01.890 --> 43:03.926
I'm gonna kill you.

43:05.060 --> 43:06.060
Look.

43:06.295 --> 43:09.164
<i>Greatest hits</i>
<i>of gene Allison.</i> See?

43:10.199 --> 43:13.902
No. You're a liar
and so is that boy.

43:14.403 --> 43:16.672
You're doing this
to mess with me.

43:17.072 --> 43:18.512
Anna and I are gonna
leave right now.

43:18.574 --> 43:19.951
- Please don't.
- You... you're disgusting.

43:19.975 --> 43:21.543
- Please don't.
- You see this?

43:22.444 --> 43:23.444
Go to hell.

43:23.946 --> 43:25.481
Yeah, I'm divorcing you now.

43:25.547 --> 43:26.315
We're done.

43:26.382 --> 43:27.516
- Listen to me...
- I'm out.

43:27.583 --> 43:28.583
Jessica!

43:28.852 --> 43:31.029
- Come on. I want you to get up. Get up.
- No, you can't leave dad.

43:31.053 --> 43:33.122
- Jessica!
- I'm out.

43:34.523 --> 43:37.326
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

43:38.227 --> 43:39.261
Toby?

43:43.732 --> 43:46.635
Oh, my god.

43:47.804 --> 43:50.406
Wait. I figured it out.

43:59.515 --> 44:01.016
Other than Anna...

44:02.317 --> 44:04.319
You're all in on this,
aren't you?

44:07.656 --> 44:09.725
- In on what?
- In on this.

44:10.559 --> 44:12.694
You're all working together,
aren't you?

44:14.763 --> 44:15.763
You and the old man,

44:15.799 --> 44:18.367
both have keys
to the locked room.

44:18.934 --> 44:19.934
And you,

44:20.569 --> 44:23.105
you already know these people
and you paid them.

44:23.272 --> 44:26.141
You set me up
and taped me somehow

44:26.241 --> 44:28.177
and now, you're getting
your sick revenge.

44:28.243 --> 44:30.345
You don't want
to rebuild our marriage.

44:30.412 --> 44:31.480
You want revenge.

44:31.613 --> 44:34.249
- You're crazy.
- You know, I knew you were vicious

44:34.316 --> 44:35.350
I knew it,

44:35.451 --> 44:37.686
but I didn't know
you were a psychopath.

44:38.587 --> 44:40.322
How could you do this to Anna?

44:40.422 --> 44:42.591
I've never met
these people before in my life.

44:43.292 --> 44:44.492
I'm calling the police on you.

44:44.593 --> 44:45.970
- Call them. Call them right now.
- Wait, wait.

44:45.994 --> 44:47.095
Who took my phone?

44:47.262 --> 44:50.098
- Where is my phone?
- Stop, dad! Stop!

44:50.165 --> 44:51.165
Maybe it was Vivienne.

44:51.333 --> 44:52.377
Maybe... maybe she's the one
that set you up.

44:52.401 --> 44:53.702
Did you ever think about that?

44:55.370 --> 44:57.773
And you're a lying,
cheating asshole

44:57.907 --> 45:00.576
and she's probably
exactly like you.

45:01.410 --> 45:04.646
You're the one who followed me,
who stalked me.

45:04.948 --> 45:06.883
Exactly. What if she's doing
the same thing?

45:06.982 --> 45:09.418
Please stop!

45:12.789 --> 45:14.256
Before you played that...

45:15.457 --> 45:16.457
Record...

45:18.327 --> 45:19.628
What were you going to say?

45:20.596 --> 45:22.297
I was gonna tell you
that there's something

45:22.364 --> 45:24.533
you need to see
in that locked room.

45:33.075 --> 45:35.544
- Holy shit!
- What?

45:35.812 --> 45:37.012
Someone's out there.

45:38.146 --> 45:39.146
Where?

45:39.381 --> 45:41.450
I saw something by the water.

45:41.818 --> 45:43.018
Could be a coyote.

45:43.452 --> 45:46.555
Yeah, could be. Or maybe a wolf.

45:47.189 --> 45:48.457
Even a wild dog.

45:53.662 --> 45:54.797
There!

45:54.864 --> 45:56.775
- I don't see it. Where are you looking?
- No, I saw it.

45:56.799 --> 45:58.367
I saw it too.

46:00.803 --> 46:03.338
Probably just a coyote.
Or a wolf.

46:04.239 --> 46:05.674
Better to be safe though.

46:13.783 --> 46:15.250
Good thing
this gun's still here.

46:16.351 --> 46:17.351
Whoa.

46:19.087 --> 46:20.222
Don't worry.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.125
If you're righteous,
you'll survive.

46:24.259 --> 46:27.362
- Just be careful, please.
- Wait.

46:27.763 --> 46:28.831
How's this camera work?

46:32.601 --> 46:35.070
<i>Look, grandpappy.</i>

46:36.138 --> 46:37.339
<i>I'm a movie star.</i>

46:39.274 --> 46:41.143
Don't put me on that.

46:42.812 --> 46:43.812
Isaac.

46:45.180 --> 46:46.748
Isaac, what is it that you want?

46:49.151 --> 46:51.353
I want you to take
real good care of this camera.

46:52.521 --> 46:54.857
<i>I'm gonna be famous one day.</i>

46:55.858 --> 46:57.359
<i>Just like Charles manson.</i>

47:07.603 --> 47:10.138
You know,
you hear about god's son.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.208
Does Satan have a son?

47:13.943 --> 47:16.411
Food for thought.

47:21.383 --> 47:22.785
Please put that gun down.

47:24.020 --> 47:25.888
- Let's go outside, John.
- No.

47:28.423 --> 47:31.159
- Why not?
- Because you're gonna shoot me.

47:31.627 --> 47:32.627
Shoot you?

47:33.195 --> 47:36.899
- <i>♪ Tell me the truth... ♪</i>
- I thought we were gonna go hunt coyotes.

47:37.766 --> 47:40.602
We can talk about this.
Can we talk about this, please?

47:41.104 --> 47:42.839
Will you please
put that gun down?

47:43.205 --> 47:45.307
- Please?
- Jessica.

47:46.775 --> 47:47.775
Fine.

47:48.477 --> 47:50.379
I'll leave the gun
with grandpappy.

47:51.279 --> 47:52.581
You can stay here with your wife

47:52.648 --> 47:53.648
and your daughter.

47:55.350 --> 48:00.857
<i>♪ If you will only
tell me the truth ♪</i>

48:01.623 --> 48:03.625
Okay, John. No gun.

48:04.127 --> 48:06.395
- <i>♪ Whoa...</i>
- Let's go for that walk.

48:08.196 --> 48:10.265
- John.
- No, dad. Dad.

48:10.399 --> 48:12.434
Just stay here.
It'll be all right.

48:12.935 --> 48:13.970
- Don't go.
- It's okay.

48:14.037 --> 48:16.438
- Don't go, dad. Don't go.
- I know. I know.

48:16.772 --> 48:17.772
It's okay.

48:20.442 --> 48:25.447
<i>♪ And I just don't understand ♪</i>

48:27.817 --> 48:33.755
<i>♪ why don't you tell me

48:37.492 --> 48:39.361
Oh, come on, little girlie.

48:40.163 --> 48:41.763
You don't gotta be frightened.

48:43.132 --> 48:44.566
I'm not the bogeyman.

48:46.301 --> 48:51.640
<i>♪ That I'm willing

48:52.108 --> 48:53.575

48:53.843 --> 48:58.815

49:17.066 --> 49:20.469
This wasn't the deal we made.

49:22.604 --> 49:25.141
No, listen,
all you have to do is Rob us

49:25.340 --> 49:27.009
and shoot Jessica.

49:27.110 --> 49:28.744
What the fuck
are you doing in there?

49:28.811 --> 49:30.579
What the fuck are you
pushing me for?

49:32.815 --> 49:34.917
How did you get that recording
of me and Vivienne?

49:35.051 --> 49:36.685
- Oh, magic.
- Yeah?

49:36.752 --> 49:38.487
- Yeah.
- I have to look squeaky-clean

49:38.553 --> 49:41.157
and you have to be believable
for Anna's sake.

49:41.224 --> 49:42.357
Oh, I'm not believable?

49:42.892 --> 49:46.028
They don't know I'm 21,
that... that I was in the army.

49:46.361 --> 49:48.563
But you keep fucking up my plan.

49:48.931 --> 49:50.066
I'm fucking up?

49:50.599 --> 49:52.734
I'm not the one
trying to murder my wife.

49:52.835 --> 49:53.836
Don't say that.

49:54.302 --> 49:55.805
- Murder? Murder.
- Don't say that.

49:55.872 --> 49:57.381
- Don't say that.
- You don't like that word.

49:57.405 --> 49:59.741
- Murder. Murder.
- Don't say that. Don't say that.

49:59.809 --> 50:02.812
Don't say that.
Don't say that, Isaac.

50:03.645 --> 50:05.313
Get off of me.

50:09.051 --> 50:10.285
This was the perfect plan.

50:10.485 --> 50:11.845
I knew that
she would drag me here.

50:11.888 --> 50:14.489
She babbled
about this stupid house nonstop.

50:14.791 --> 50:17.759
I spent so long strategizing
and finding you.

50:17.827 --> 50:18.827
Yeah.

50:19.494 --> 50:21.998
It's not easy finding a killer for hire.

50:22.297 --> 50:24.133
You gotta visit
some pretty dark places.

50:24.901 --> 50:27.569
I'm not gonna pay you
if this thing goes sideways.

50:27.804 --> 50:28.805
Oh.

50:29.205 --> 50:31.339
Yeah, 'cause you'll be in jail.

50:31.874 --> 50:32.707
Well, so will you.

50:32.875 --> 50:34.519
Along with that crazy, old man
you work with.

50:34.543 --> 50:36.179
He's never
gonna see daylight again.

50:36.545 --> 50:38.680
You're gonna see
the electric chair, bub.

50:40.116 --> 50:41.750
You're the mastermind here.

50:42.819 --> 50:43.953
We're just country folk.

50:44.921 --> 50:47.455
What happened to our cat
in that locked room?

50:48.657 --> 50:51.326
Maybe a coyote killed him
and I brought him back to life.

50:51.393 --> 50:52.570
This is what I'm talking about.

50:52.594 --> 50:54.696
You quit scaring people
with this voodoo shit

50:54.763 --> 50:55.998
and do your job.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.767
This is my job.

50:59.101 --> 51:00.101
Okay.

51:00.702 --> 51:03.538
Keep the train on the tracks
and you'll get your 100 grand.

51:03.605 --> 51:06.275
Then you can take the car
to Mexico, like we planned.

51:06.441 --> 51:08.610
I feel like
you're trying to control me.

51:10.847 --> 51:12.148
You want your wife gone,

51:12.882 --> 51:14.516
you want a good story
for your kid,

51:15.017 --> 51:18.020
for the cops
and your shiny, new girlfriend.

51:19.322 --> 51:20.522
That takes work.

51:21.791 --> 51:23.025
That takes trust.

51:26.494 --> 51:28.663
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

51:29.531 --> 51:31.968
We can call
this whole thing off right now.

51:32.367 --> 51:33.468
No, we are doing it,

51:33.535 --> 51:35.704
but from now on,
play by the rules.

51:36.371 --> 51:37.639
- Okay.
- Okay.

51:38.406 --> 51:39.909
So go in there,

51:39.976 --> 51:41.911
Rob us,
and when we're walking back

51:41.978 --> 51:45.380
to the locked room,
you shoot Jessica in the head

51:45.480 --> 51:47.116
and then you get the fuck out.

51:49.584 --> 51:50.584
Okay.

52:06.701 --> 52:09.005
They've been gone so long now.

52:11.274 --> 52:14.643
I could put some music on again.

52:14.776 --> 52:15.776
No.

52:16.511 --> 52:17.712
No, it's okay.

52:18.047 --> 52:19.181
What...

52:21.350 --> 52:22.785
What's... what's your real name?

52:25.453 --> 52:26.923
Grandpappy's fine.

52:28.423 --> 52:30.092
Grandpappy. Grandpappy.

52:35.463 --> 52:36.966
I wanna ask you something.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.800
Yeah?

52:42.771 --> 52:44.773
I think there's something
wrong with Isaac.

52:45.674 --> 52:48.244
I think that he is... evil,

52:48.811 --> 52:50.445
and he wants to hurt people.

52:52.214 --> 52:54.116
Yeah, some days,
I think that too.

52:58.020 --> 52:59.956
- But you're not like him.
- Hmm.

53:00.323 --> 53:01.791
Not from what I can tell.

53:05.227 --> 53:06.227
So...

53:09.664 --> 53:11.133
I'd like to make a proposition.

53:12.234 --> 53:13.936
- A proposition?
- Yes.

53:17.206 --> 53:18.673
Let me and my daughter go.

53:19.308 --> 53:20.943
We'll sneak out.
Isaac won't see us.

53:21.010 --> 53:23.779
We'll get in our car
and drive away.

53:24.347 --> 53:25.580
What about dad?

53:25.815 --> 53:26.815
Quiet.

53:31.486 --> 53:32.855
You'll go to the police.

53:32.955 --> 53:34.991
I'll tell them
that you're innocent.

53:35.523 --> 53:37.927
I'll say that you're a hostage
just like us.

53:39.661 --> 53:43.165
But I have a gun.

53:45.567 --> 53:47.769
Well, I think Isaac
is making you do this.

53:48.503 --> 53:49.738
I know he is.

53:51.073 --> 53:54.877
I can't turn my back on him.

53:56.012 --> 53:57.813
If you let us go, I will...

53:57.980 --> 54:00.116
I will give you
everything I have.

54:01.683 --> 54:03.185
Mom, what about dad?

54:04.253 --> 54:05.921
We can't just
leave him here to die.

54:06.422 --> 54:07.522
Hush.

54:08.457 --> 54:09.758
They're almost back.

54:10.793 --> 54:12.594
Oh, shit.

54:14.629 --> 54:16.698
I can't believe
you wanted to leave dad.

54:18.700 --> 54:20.069
Don't tell him I said that.

54:31.313 --> 54:32.714
We didn't see any coyotes.

54:33.115 --> 54:34.216
But we did some talking.

54:35.518 --> 54:38.020
Ma'am, your husband's right.

54:38.454 --> 54:39.454
We're robbing you.

54:40.089 --> 54:42.258
Me and grandpappy
are gonna lock you in that room.

54:42.825 --> 54:44.236
See, we've been sneaking
in this house

54:44.260 --> 54:45.394
for a few weeks now.

54:45.693 --> 54:47.129
Thought you were the new owners.

54:47.662 --> 54:48.998
Just bad luck, really.

54:49.432 --> 54:50.598
Like bone cancer.

54:51.766 --> 54:53.202
You're gonna lock us
in the room?

54:53.536 --> 54:54.536
Yes, ma'am.

54:54.970 --> 54:56.771
After we take
your money and your SUV.

54:56.872 --> 55:01.743
- That was their plan all along.
- But we'll die if you lock us up. How... how will we get out?

55:02.178 --> 55:05.247
We'll call the police,
leave an anonymous tip.

55:05.981 --> 55:08.117
I'll leave some food and
water in there for you.

55:08.184 --> 55:10.319
Thank you. I trust them.

55:10.386 --> 55:12.021
You're a fucking idiot.

55:12.088 --> 55:14.156
They are not
gonna call the police.

55:16.425 --> 55:19.761
My daughter is 14 years old.

55:19.862 --> 55:24.100
Please, i'm... I'm asking you,
please don't do this.

55:24.533 --> 55:27.436
- Ma'am, you have my word.
- Your word?

55:27.735 --> 55:30.039
- Your word doesn't mean anything.
- Calm down, okay?

55:30.106 --> 55:33.209
Your word means even less.
Why the fuck would I calm down?

55:33.342 --> 55:35.710
Jess.

55:36.278 --> 55:37.513
It's the room or a bullet.

55:45.387 --> 55:46.889
It's okay.

56:02.505 --> 56:03.638
Time's wasting.

56:04.639 --> 56:06.142
What is this place?

56:06.609 --> 56:07.775
Why are you doing this?

56:08.344 --> 56:11.514
- Why are you doing this?
- I think we just have to put our differences aside...

56:11.580 --> 56:12.815
And do what they...

56:12.882 --> 56:14.150
Don't talk to me!

56:19.721 --> 56:21.157
You first, John.

56:22.657 --> 56:24.393
Me?

56:25.928 --> 56:27.796
- It's okay.
- Dad.

56:28.597 --> 56:29.798
- Go on.
- No.

56:33.335 --> 56:35.905
- No. No.
- All right.

56:44.213 --> 56:45.213
Dad.

56:47.616 --> 56:49.218
Come on.

57:00.963 --> 57:02.097
Isaac?

57:03.666 --> 57:05.301
Isaac, what are you doing?

57:05.935 --> 57:07.636
I'm putting you
where you belong, John.

57:07.836 --> 57:12.141
Isaac, let me out.

57:12.641 --> 57:13.741
John...

57:15.077 --> 57:16.077
Isaac.

57:16.946 --> 57:19.081
- Let me out.
- Hey, John?

57:20.249 --> 57:21.317
Murder.

57:24.719 --> 57:26.889
Let me out, Isaac.

57:29.158 --> 57:30.326
Isaac...

57:30.758 --> 57:32.161
Isaac...

57:33.028 --> 57:34.063
Isaac...

57:34.663 --> 57:36.599
I'm gonna kill you!

57:37.066 --> 57:39.702
Isaac, open the door!

57:39.868 --> 57:40.903
Open the door!

57:41.203 --> 57:43.305
I'm gonna fucking
tear you apart.

57:47.176 --> 57:48.176
See, ma'am,

57:48.310 --> 57:50.713
I'm guessing he's cheated on you
many a times before

57:50.813 --> 57:52.081
with many different women.

57:52.147 --> 57:53.983
But you always take
him back, don't you?

57:54.049 --> 57:56.027
- What is he talking about?
- I... I... I don't... I don't know.

57:56.051 --> 57:57.086
Anna...

57:57.152 --> 58:00.055
Hey, baby.
Don't listen to Isaac.

58:00.522 --> 58:01.756
Don't listen to him.

58:02.091 --> 58:05.561
Isaac! What do you
think you're doing?

58:05.728 --> 58:07.363
You've been in denial
about your husband

58:07.429 --> 58:08.597
for a long time now.

58:09.231 --> 58:11.231
- Anna! Let me out!
- It's time you face the truth.

58:13.936 --> 58:15.070
Better go get that.

58:15.770 --> 58:17.139
- Don't worry.
- Isaac...

58:17.206 --> 58:19.341
Me and grandpappy will stay
right here with Anna.

58:19.475 --> 58:20.943
No. No.

58:21.176 --> 58:24.647
No, mom, you can't leave me.
No, you can't leave, mom.

58:25.014 --> 58:27.283
- Mom.
- You dirty motherfucker!

58:28.317 --> 58:29.317
Isaac!

58:31.453 --> 58:32.655
Open the door.

58:32.721 --> 58:34.323
Open the door!

58:34.657 --> 58:38.460
Open this fucking door!

58:38.627 --> 58:40.429
Anna? Anna.

58:40.663 --> 58:44.433
Baby, don't listen to what he says, baby.

58:44.867 --> 58:46.235
Listen, he's a liar.

58:46.468 --> 58:51.240
If he says anything about me,
you know he's lying, okay?

58:51.640 --> 58:54.743
Okay? Same with your mother!

58:55.010 --> 58:57.813
Same with your fucking mother!

59:03.752 --> 59:04.920
You.

59:05.321 --> 59:06.321
Oh, my god.

59:07.289 --> 59:08.090
You're his wife.

59:08.290 --> 59:10.726
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry. I... I got a text.

59:10.893 --> 59:12.828
From my husband?

59:13.262 --> 59:14.262
Yes.

59:14.897 --> 59:16.465
You knew he was married?

59:17.032 --> 59:18.600
You're as bad as he is.

59:18.802 --> 59:20.369
I'm really, really sorry.

59:20.569 --> 59:23.305
I am. He... he told me that
he was here all alone here,

59:23.372 --> 59:25.074
that he needed me
to come right away.

59:25.274 --> 59:27.943
See? I drove as fast as I could.

59:28.977 --> 59:31.480
- My husband didn't text you that.
- What?

59:31.714 --> 59:32.794
This house is being robbed.

59:33.048 --> 59:35.048
The men are still inside.
They have John locked up.

59:35.819 --> 59:37.953
- Are you serious?
- Yes. My daughter's inside too.

59:38.220 --> 59:40.689
They took John's phone
and texted you to lure you here.

59:40.756 --> 59:42.291
- Why?
- To hurt you. They're crazy.

59:42.491 --> 59:45.036
- They have a gun.
- Okay, well... well, I'll help however you need, okay?

59:45.060 --> 59:47.906
- I'll... I'll call the police.
- No, phones don't work. Do you have anything

59:47.930 --> 59:49.833
I can use as a weapon?
I don't know, a knife?

59:49.998 --> 59:51.476
- Mace. Mace.
- Give it to me. Give it to me.

59:51.500 --> 59:53.020
- Okay.
- You need to go to the police.

59:53.068 --> 59:54.828
Tell them that we are
being held at gunpoint.

59:54.870 --> 59:56.572
There's an old man
and a teenage boy.

59:56.638 --> 59:58.640
Is John okay? Anna?

59:59.641 --> 1:00:01.577
Do not use my daughter's name.

1:00:02.812 --> 1:00:04.113
You disgust me.

1:00:04.747 --> 1:00:07.427
- I actually came here to break up with John.
- I don't give a shit.

1:00:07.516 --> 1:00:09.327
- You can have him.
- He told me all of this...

1:00:09.351 --> 1:00:10.351
Shut up.

1:00:12.121 --> 1:00:14.456
From now on,
my family is me and my daughter.

1:00:15.691 --> 1:00:19.261
If you don't come back here
with the police and I survive...

1:00:20.129 --> 1:00:23.499
I swear, I will find you
and I will kill you.

1:00:24.733 --> 1:00:26.034
I'll get help. I swear.

1:00:26.935 --> 1:00:28.270
- Go.
- Okay.

1:00:55.664 --> 1:00:57.299
No, don't do this.

1:00:59.935 --> 1:01:01.336
They're taking too long.

1:01:01.970 --> 1:01:03.605
Take Anna out
and get the gasoline.

1:01:04.239 --> 1:01:05.240
Anna!

1:01:05.340 --> 1:01:06.508
Dad! Dad!

1:01:06.608 --> 1:01:07.376
Anna!

1:01:07.576 --> 1:01:09.745
Isaac, you betrayed me.

1:01:10.179 --> 1:01:12.782
- You betrayed me!
- You betrayed your own family.

1:01:12.849 --> 1:01:14.450
I'm gonna Bury
every cent of that money.

1:01:14.516 --> 1:01:18.654
You're not gonna see anything.
You're not gonna see anything!

1:01:18.954 --> 1:01:20.924
You really think
I was in this for the money?

1:01:22.724 --> 1:01:27.596
Put the key in, Isaac.
Put the key in!

1:01:27.931 --> 1:01:30.432
Put the key in, Isaac!

1:01:30.566 --> 1:01:32.100
Let me out!

1:01:32.167 --> 1:01:34.069
Open the fucking door!

1:01:34.136 --> 1:01:36.271
Isaac. Isaac!

1:01:36.438 --> 1:01:39.007
- Open the door!
- Check the closet, John.

1:01:39.775 --> 1:01:41.176
It's your only way out.

1:02:17.145 --> 1:02:19.147
Open that closet fast, John.

1:02:27.824 --> 1:02:28.824
Come on.

1:02:32.661 --> 1:02:34.730
Shit.

1:02:36.498 --> 1:02:37.699
- Oh, my god.
- Try it again.

1:02:37.766 --> 1:02:39.286
- I'm trying.
- Try it again, Vivienne.

1:02:40.502 --> 1:02:41.804
Okay.

1:02:41.871 --> 1:02:43.105
- Oh, my god.
- Vivienne.

1:02:43.305 --> 1:02:45.040
The doors won't open.

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:47.209
- What is happening?
- I'm trapped!

1:02:48.310 --> 1:02:49.012
Jessica.

1:02:49.077 --> 1:02:50.646
- Look out.
- Mom.

1:02:51.981 --> 1:02:53.582
Grandpappy's making me do this.

1:03:00.023 --> 1:03:02.391
Stop.

1:03:02.457 --> 1:03:04.726
Right there.

1:03:09.698 --> 1:03:12.601
It's a fine night for a bonfire,
don't you think?

1:03:14.037 --> 1:03:15.203
That's what Isaac says.

1:03:15.337 --> 1:03:16.940
We called the police on you.

1:03:17.573 --> 1:03:20.409
- They're on their way.
- Now, you know that's not true.

1:03:21.911 --> 1:03:23.478
Isaac's controlling this,
isn't he?

1:03:23.913 --> 1:03:24.913
But why?

1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:27.382
Maybe he didn't have
nothing better to do.

1:03:28.550 --> 1:03:31.253
It's so heavy, mom.
I can't hold it anymore.

1:03:32.087 --> 1:03:34.489
You start pouring
that gasoline on the car.

1:03:36.625 --> 1:03:39.328
- There's a woman inside.
- That woman is no good.

1:03:40.095 --> 1:03:42.164
- You know what? Her and your dad...
- Hey.

1:03:42.497 --> 1:03:43.497
Don't say it.

1:03:43.732 --> 1:03:44.732
Why?

1:03:45.001 --> 1:03:46.768
You trying to protect
his good name?

1:03:46.836 --> 1:03:48.303
I'm protecting my daughter.

1:03:49.671 --> 1:03:50.671
Anna...

1:03:52.875 --> 1:03:55.677
Start pouring that gas
or I'm gonna shoot your mama.

1:03:57.346 --> 1:04:00.382
You do it yourself.
You don't make my child do it.

1:04:00.482 --> 1:04:02.085
That's not how this works.

1:04:02.317 --> 1:04:03.452
Don't.

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:04.921
Don't! Don't!

1:04:05.287 --> 1:04:07.155
- Don't. Stop it, please!
- No. Hey.

1:04:07.857 --> 1:04:08.857
Go back.

1:04:09.658 --> 1:04:10.658
I'll do it.

1:04:10.759 --> 1:04:11.759
- No!
- Good.

1:04:12.929 --> 1:04:13.929
No.

1:04:14.931 --> 1:04:16.498
- Don't!
- Anna, shut your eyes.

1:04:16.632 --> 1:04:17.332
Mom.

1:04:17.633 --> 1:04:19.768
No, Jessica!

1:04:20.469 --> 1:04:22.071
No!

1:04:22.471 --> 1:04:25.540
- Make sure you get some under the hood.
- I'm sorry!

1:04:25.741 --> 1:04:28.978
No, Jessica! Oh, my god!

1:04:29.378 --> 1:04:31.114
No, Jessica, please!

1:04:31.446 --> 1:04:33.715
- Jessica, no!
- I'm so fucking sorry.

1:04:33.783 --> 1:04:36.184
No!

1:04:37.486 --> 1:04:39.287
No!

1:04:44.593 --> 1:04:48.497
Jessica! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Jessica!

1:04:48.730 --> 1:04:51.166
Please! Stop!

1:04:52.035 --> 1:04:54.770
Jessica! Please!

1:04:55.038 --> 1:04:56.072
Stop!

1:04:56.139 --> 1:04:58.141
No!

1:04:58.540 --> 1:05:00.877
- Don't do it! No!
- Ashes to ashes.

1:05:02.111 --> 1:05:03.046
Dust to dust.

1:05:03.112 --> 1:05:04.881
No, Jessica!

1:05:05.547 --> 1:05:06.547
Oh, my god!

1:05:11.219 --> 1:05:13.122
Just like cooking veal.

1:05:13.255 --> 1:05:14.589
Oh, my god.

1:05:16.025 --> 1:05:18.727
Please, Jessica, no!

1:05:22.764 --> 1:05:24.801
Help me!

1:05:25.134 --> 1:05:26.635
No!

1:05:28.403 --> 1:05:29.538
No!

1:05:30.405 --> 1:05:33.642
- Anna, run!
- Jessica! No!

1:05:36.678 --> 1:05:39.448
Motherfucker!

1:05:43.152 --> 1:05:44.653
- Anna!
- Mom!

1:05:44.821 --> 1:05:47.656
Oh, god. Vivienne. Vivienne.

1:05:48.791 --> 1:05:49.992
Oh, god, Vivienne.

1:05:51.894 --> 1:05:52.895
Oh, my god!

1:05:53.395 --> 1:05:57.332
Shit. Vivienne! Fuck!

1:06:03.039 --> 1:06:04.941
Honey, no, it's okay.

1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:07.009
Come here, Anna.
Anna, look at me.

1:06:07.176 --> 1:06:10.012
Look at me. Are you okay?
Are you okay? Okay.

1:06:10.412 --> 1:06:13.082
All right. Honey. Oh, god.

1:06:13.381 --> 1:06:16.085
- No keys. Shit, shit, shit.
- Isaac has all the keys.

1:06:16.185 --> 1:06:20.189
Oh, dad has the other key.
Honey, honey, you have to stay.

1:06:20.489 --> 1:06:21.991
- Okay, listen to me.
- What?

1:06:22.058 --> 1:06:23.258
If you see Isaac,

1:06:23.425 --> 1:06:24.693
- you're gonna scream...
- No.

1:06:24.827 --> 1:06:26.270
- And then you shoot him.
- No, no, no.

1:06:26.294 --> 1:06:27.672
- Mom, I can't do this.
- You can do this.

1:06:27.696 --> 1:06:29.999
- You can't... I can't do this.
- You're gonna do this.

1:06:30.066 --> 1:06:31.733
Listen to me. You're gonna aim

1:06:31.868 --> 1:06:33.628
and you're gonna shoot
and I'll come running.

1:06:33.668 --> 1:06:36.371
You're gonna aim at his eyes, okay?

1:06:36.471 --> 1:06:38.406
- Listen to me.
- I can't do this, mom!

1:06:38.473 --> 1:06:39.474
Listen to me.

1:06:40.076 --> 1:06:42.945
If I don't try to save your dad,
you will never forgive me.

1:06:43.012 --> 1:06:45.747
Okay. Okay.

1:06:46.581 --> 1:06:48.050
Mom, what are you gonna do?

1:06:48.217 --> 1:06:49.919
Take this. It's mace.

1:06:50.385 --> 1:06:52.721
I'm gonna find Isaac.

1:07:17.746 --> 1:07:18.781
Isaac?

1:07:23.286 --> 1:07:25.720
Isaac.

1:07:34.496 --> 1:07:36.464
Grandpappy needs you.

1:07:37.934 --> 1:07:39.701
He's hurt real bad.

1:07:54.283 --> 1:07:55.450
John?

1:08:12.301 --> 1:08:14.136
Hello?

1:08:22.979 --> 1:08:26.182
John?

1:08:51.740 --> 1:08:54.210
John?

1:08:54.377 --> 1:08:55.878
John.

1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:05.220
Jess...

1:09:12.228 --> 1:09:15.398
Is Anna okay?

1:09:15.865 --> 1:09:18.667
She's fine.

1:09:18.733 --> 1:09:21.337
Isaac said
that Vivienne is here...

1:09:24.874 --> 1:09:27.176
And they killed her.

1:09:27.243 --> 1:09:28.243
No.

1:09:28.911 --> 1:09:30.745
Vivienne's...

1:09:30.813 --> 1:09:34.050
Vivienne's alive.

1:09:35.351 --> 1:09:38.553
She's... she's waiting for you.

1:09:48.596 --> 1:09:50.532
John, do you have the car keys?

1:09:53.936 --> 1:09:55.237
Isaac took them.

1:09:59.474 --> 1:10:00.775
Jessica...

1:10:02.644 --> 1:10:07.817
Tell Vivienne I love her.

1:10:08.616 --> 1:10:12.587
I will.

1:10:47.957 --> 1:10:48.957
Hey.

1:10:49.492 --> 1:10:50.625
Mom!

1:10:52.361 --> 1:10:53.362
Don't come any closer.

1:10:53.661 --> 1:10:55.965
- Or what?
- Or I'll shoot you.

1:10:57.033 --> 1:10:59.168
Mom, it's Isaac! Mom!

1:11:00.836 --> 1:11:02.604
You ever even shot a gun before?

1:11:04.407 --> 1:11:06.909
Did you hurt my dad?

1:11:07.877 --> 1:11:09.345
You're so pretty when you cry.

1:11:09.512 --> 1:11:11.947
You're such a good girl, Anna.

1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:14.316
So sweet and pure
in your nature.

1:11:14.517 --> 1:11:18.120
Stop it. Stop talking.

1:11:19.021 --> 1:11:20.356
I know
what you're going through.

1:11:20.923 --> 1:11:22.590
I've been there too.

1:11:24.126 --> 1:11:25.861
You deserve better
than your parents.

1:11:26.495 --> 1:11:27.662
You deserve love.

1:11:28.364 --> 1:11:29.865
My parents love me.

1:11:31.934 --> 1:11:33.302
Treat you like an afterbirth.

1:11:33.502 --> 1:11:35.337
That's not true.

1:11:36.072 --> 1:11:37.807
That's not true!

1:11:38.441 --> 1:11:39.842
You want to go
for a ride with me?

1:11:40.910 --> 1:11:41.910
No.

1:11:42.211 --> 1:11:43.879
But you don't even know
where I'm headed.

1:11:46.549 --> 1:11:48.683
I can show you things
you can't even dream of.

1:11:51.719 --> 1:11:53.355
Got a little boat
tied up out back.

1:11:53.688 --> 1:11:55.224
Grandpappy didn't even
know about it.

1:11:56.425 --> 1:11:59.895
We can disappear into the bayou.
No one will ever see us again.

1:12:01.430 --> 1:12:03.199
I don't make this
offer to many girls.

1:12:04.366 --> 1:12:06.035
It's a rare gem of an offer.

1:12:07.236 --> 1:12:08.236
Just like you.

1:12:10.005 --> 1:12:11.005
A rare gem.

1:12:14.510 --> 1:12:15.677
Anna!

1:12:29.125 --> 1:12:30.126
Mom!

1:12:31.227 --> 1:12:33.162
Let her go!

1:12:33.329 --> 1:12:36.298
Whoa, whoa. Whoa,
whoa. Can't do that, ma'am.

1:12:37.099 --> 1:12:39.568
See, I'm thinking about taking
your daughter here as my wife.

1:12:39.667 --> 1:12:40.936
Hardly seen a prettier girl.

1:12:41.070 --> 1:12:42.590
You'll go to hell
for what you've done.

1:12:42.637 --> 1:12:43.638
Been there already.

1:12:44.039 --> 1:12:45.808
Not much to see
compared to earth.

1:12:46.809 --> 1:12:49.245
Anna, stay strong.

1:12:50.712 --> 1:12:52.348
You know
why this happened, don't you?

1:12:53.015 --> 1:12:56.318
See, your husband hired me
and grandpappy to kill you.

1:13:00.089 --> 1:13:01.190
That's not true.

1:13:01.624 --> 1:13:02.657
Oh, sure it is.

1:13:03.125 --> 1:13:05.895
See, he thought
we were just country folk.

1:13:06.862 --> 1:13:08.864
Didn't understand
the nature of the beast.

1:13:10.665 --> 1:13:14.336
Truth is John's the one
who needed to be killed.

1:13:15.104 --> 1:13:16.104
Not you.

1:13:19.909 --> 1:13:21.310
Or your lovely, little Anna.

1:13:23.678 --> 1:13:24.847
Oh, fuck!

1:13:24.914 --> 1:13:26.248
Oh, fuck!

1:13:26.748 --> 1:13:28.284
No!

1:13:29.585 --> 1:13:30.786
Don't hurt my mom.

1:13:33.422 --> 1:13:34.657
Hey, hey.

1:13:34.722 --> 1:13:37.226
Hey.

1:13:39.795 --> 1:13:42.264
Hold on. Let's talk about this.

1:13:43.199 --> 1:13:46.602
If you're righteous,
you'll survive.

1:14:05.988 --> 1:14:09.925
I was just joshing
about marrying your daughter.

1:14:11.694 --> 1:14:13.761
From where I sit,

1:14:14.530 --> 1:14:16.232
marriage is just
a pit of spikes.

1:14:16.565 --> 1:14:18.100
Who the hell are you?

1:14:19.835 --> 1:14:22.705
I see myself as a moral compass.

1:14:23.138 --> 1:14:26.909
People spin
in the wrong direction,

1:14:27.343 --> 1:14:28.444
I set 'em straight.

1:14:33.215 --> 1:14:35.851
Me and the old man
built this house

1:14:36.452 --> 1:14:38.387
for people just like your husband.

1:14:39.754 --> 1:14:42.458
Murderers, liars, cheaters

1:14:43.359 --> 1:14:45.027
and sinners are all alike.

1:14:45.961 --> 1:14:47.762
They're drawn to it
like a magnet.

1:14:48.931 --> 1:14:50.332
It's my task to kill 'em.

1:14:50.866 --> 1:14:52.034
You're insane.

1:14:52.368 --> 1:14:55.070
I've been alive for centuries.

1:14:57.673 --> 1:14:58.974
Maybe I'm a demon.

1:15:00.042 --> 1:15:02.311
Or maybe I'm an angel.

1:15:03.579 --> 1:15:05.347
Or just a really confused kid.

1:15:22.564 --> 1:15:23.866
Here.

1:15:23.999 --> 1:15:26.068
Take 'em.

1:15:33.676 --> 1:15:35.878
Anna.

1:15:40.049 --> 1:15:41.250
Honey, Isaac's dying.

1:15:41.317 --> 1:15:43.118
- I'm fucking scared, mom.
- We have to go.

1:15:43.352 --> 1:15:44.920
Go. Go! We have to go.

1:15:44.987 --> 1:15:47.456
Everything's
gonna be okay. Run. Run! Run.

1:15:47.523 --> 1:15:49.992
Run. Run.

1:16:06.342 --> 1:16:09.378
Thank god.

1:16:20.656 --> 1:16:21.656
Check your phone.

1:16:21.924 --> 1:16:23.459
Check your phone
right now, please.

1:16:23.559 --> 1:16:26.195
Do you have a signal?

1:16:26.261 --> 1:16:28.664
I don't have any.
Why isn't it working, mom?

1:16:28.731 --> 1:16:30.232
It's not working.

1:16:30.466 --> 1:16:31.533
Did Isaac hurt you?

1:16:31.867 --> 1:16:33.435
Did he... did he touch you?

1:16:33.803 --> 1:16:35.738
- No.
- No?

1:16:36.071 --> 1:16:38.440
We left dad there, mom.

1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:41.377
We have to go back.
What about dad, mom?

1:16:41.477 --> 1:16:43.512
- What about... what about dad?
- What about dad?

1:16:43.612 --> 1:16:46.014
Listen to me. We're safe.

1:16:46.582 --> 1:16:49.786
That's what matters.
That we're safe right now.

1:16:49.853 --> 1:16:50.953
We're safe.

1:17:08.404 --> 1:17:10.706
And I keep telling you,
there are no houses out there.

1:17:11.006 --> 1:17:12.274
Not like the one you described.

1:17:12.541 --> 1:17:15.812
Yeah, something went wrong
with my phone and my computer

1:17:15.911 --> 1:17:18.213
and the pictures
aren't there anymore.

1:17:18.747 --> 1:17:20.115
It's not like
I don't believe you.

1:17:20.382 --> 1:17:23.485
We were inside that house.
I was the real estate agent.

1:17:23.585 --> 1:17:25.721
The house is real
and we need to find it

1:17:25.789 --> 1:17:26.789
and my husband.

1:17:27.055 --> 1:17:29.425
And we need to find Isaac
and... and the old man.

1:17:32.394 --> 1:17:36.165
- It's easy to get confused on the bayou.
- We're not confused.

1:17:36.698 --> 1:17:38.400
Isaac tried to kill us.

1:17:39.501 --> 1:17:41.370
And my dad is dead.

1:17:42.004 --> 1:17:44.173
Like I said,
deputies will be dispatched.

1:17:45.474 --> 1:17:46.985
Listen, I don't know
what really went on

1:17:47.009 --> 1:17:48.169
between you and your husband,

1:17:48.477 --> 1:17:50.145
but if he's out there, we'll find him.

1:17:50.345 --> 1:17:52.414
He's probably just disoriented.

1:17:52.981 --> 1:17:54.016
He may still be alive.

1:17:54.082 --> 1:17:56.786
You haven't heard a word I said.

1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:59.054
I heard you,
but you're not making any sense.

1:17:59.121 --> 1:18:00.456
Take me to this address.

1:18:01.023 --> 1:18:04.593
I wanna to see it myself.

1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:07.496
There are no homes around here.
It's just swamp.

1:18:08.564 --> 1:18:09.564
I'm ready when you are.

1:18:09.631 --> 1:18:11.767
And my daughter's
gonna stay here in the station.

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.101
Mom...

1:18:13.837 --> 1:18:16.071
It's safer if I leave you here.

1:18:17.907 --> 1:18:19.041
Like you left dad?

1:18:19.909 --> 1:18:21.143
Is he safe?

1:18:26.950 --> 1:18:30.385
I promise, I will be back
in a couple hours.

1:19:38.821 --> 1:19:41.423
I swear, there was a house.

1:19:42.691 --> 1:19:46.194
It was... it was a big house.

1:19:50.098 --> 1:19:53.168
Uh. And there was a fire
in... in the driveway.

1:19:56.005 --> 1:19:57.139
Where?

1:19:57.472 --> 1:19:58.473
It was there.

1:20:00.043 --> 1:20:04.580
It was... it was...
It was right here.

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.583
Like I said,
it's easy to get confused.

1:20:08.051 --> 1:20:10.053
I... I'm not confused. I'm not.

1:20:10.285 --> 1:20:12.922
Then you tell me,
are we at the wrong place?

1:20:13.221 --> 1:20:17.225
No. I don't know.

1:20:19.428 --> 1:20:22.364
Look, I'm happy to take you
somewhere else, within reason.

1:20:31.673 --> 1:20:33.375
It happened here.

1:21:27.797 --> 1:21:28.797
You're right.

1:21:35.872 --> 1:21:37.272
There's nothing here.

1:21:41.077 --> 1:21:42.344
There's no house.

1:21:46.983 --> 1:21:48.283
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1:21:52.989 --> 1:21:54.523
Take me back to the station.

1:22:09.204 --> 1:22:11.016
You know, to be honest,
you're not the first person

1:22:11.040 --> 1:22:12.307
to come to me with a crazy story

1:22:12.374 --> 1:22:13.608
about a house.

1:22:17.146 --> 1:22:18.647
Can you drive faster, please?

1:22:19.115 --> 1:22:20.549
First, I need you
to do me a favor.

1:22:20.749 --> 1:22:22.985
- What?
- Open the glove compartment.

1:22:31.094 --> 1:22:32.394
Oh, my god.

1:22:33.796 --> 1:22:35.965
But this was in the house.
How did you get it?

1:22:36.999 --> 1:22:38.901
That means
we have Isaac on tape.

1:22:39.468 --> 1:22:40.569
Turn it on.

1:22:43.873 --> 1:22:45.540
<i>We're right behind you, ma'am.</i>

1:22:50.278 --> 1:22:51.513
Oh, my god.

1:22:52.048 --> 1:22:54.483
Turn this off.

1:22:54.683 --> 1:22:56.518
It's on all the stations.

1:22:56.585 --> 1:22:58.921
That's not...
This can't be happening.

1:23:00.489 --> 1:23:05.393
<i>♪ Tell me the truth ♪</i>

1:23:06.528 --> 1:23:12.034
<i>♪ please stop me from guessing ♪</i>

1:23:14.636 --> 1:23:19.608
<i>♪ darling, it will be
a blessing ♪</i>

1:23:22.644 --> 1:23:26.082
<i>♪ if you will only
tell me the truth ♪</i>

1:23:29.051 --> 1:23:31.586
It was... them.

1:23:34.689 --> 1:23:35.689
Take a breath.

1:23:37.994 --> 1:23:38.994
It's not real.

1:23:40.362 --> 1:23:41.596
No, it can't be.

1:23:47.103 --> 1:23:49.504
Isaac and grandpappy
help us keep order.

1:23:51.207 --> 1:23:53.375
I don't know what they are.
They're not human.

1:23:54.376 --> 1:23:55.544
You're crazy.

1:23:57.013 --> 1:23:58.313
We protect Isaac,

1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:00.649
and he takes care
of the evildoers.

1:24:01.984 --> 1:24:04.020
Like a spider catching flies.

1:24:04.486 --> 1:24:06.022
He sends them straight to hell.

1:24:10.059 --> 1:24:11.093
It's an illusion.

1:24:11.260 --> 1:24:12.394
Tell yourself that.

1:24:12.761 --> 1:24:15.031
The bayou plays a lot of tricks.

1:24:18.366 --> 1:24:20.102
I'm gonna tell everyone
what happened.

1:24:20.735 --> 1:24:22.337
Who would believe you?

1:24:23.705 --> 1:24:26.575
Isaac doesn't hurt
the righteous, only the wicked.

1:24:29.444 --> 1:24:30.745
But I'm not wicked.

1:24:32.414 --> 1:24:33.850
It's a matter of degrees.

1:24:37.854 --> 1:24:39.688
Heaven and hell
are a choice away.

1:24:40.790 --> 1:24:43.993
Isaac gave you
a second chance. Embrace it.

1:24:45.127 --> 1:24:46.494
Be kind.

1:24:48.064 --> 1:24:50.765
And never come back
to the house on the bayou.

1:25:15.925 --> 1:25:17.093
- Anna?
- Mom.

1:25:17.260 --> 1:25:18.260
Anna.

1:25:19.128 --> 1:25:20.830
Oh, thank god.

1:25:21.330 --> 1:25:24.633
It's okay.

1:25:26.701 --> 1:25:28.403
I love you.

1:25:28.470 --> 1:25:29.638
Oh, honey.

1:25:30.639 --> 1:25:32.440
I'm never leaving you again.
