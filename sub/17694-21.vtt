WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.036
And now "On the Lighter Side,"

00:04.038 --> 00:05.971
a teenage boy was found guilty
of murdering his own father --

00:05.973 --> 00:08.140
"On the Lighter Side"?
Who the hell's writing this?!

00:08.142 --> 00:09.441
MAN:
I just get the coffee.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.044
I don't have one of those,
either!

00:12.046 --> 00:14.880
Ashton Carlyle, the so-called
prep-school killer,

00:14.882 --> 00:16.782
can be seen reacting
to the verdict

00:16.784 --> 00:19.485
in these dramatic images
from our new courtroom artist,

00:19.487 --> 00:21.353
cartoonist Cathy Guisewite.

00:23.657 --> 00:28.227
Bet that poor boy's father
didn't spend any time with him.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.295
I hope they fry him.

00:30.297 --> 00:33.298
STAN:<i> My God, I haven't spent</i>
<i> any time with Steve lately.</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:34.633
<i> Well, I'm sure he's fine.</i>

00:36.504 --> 00:38.904
<i> What the hell kind of smile</i>
<i> was that?!</i>

00:38.906 --> 00:41.206
<i> My God,</i>
<i> he's a ticking time bomb!</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:43.342
<i>If I don't spend some time with</i>
<i> the boy, there's no telling</i>

00:43.344 --> 00:46.712
<i> what twisted, gruesome fate</i>
<i> I'll meet at his savage hands!</i>

00:46.714 --> 00:49.648
(eerie music plays)

00:50.518 --> 00:52.017
That's it!
We're hanging out.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.852
If you're gonna kill anyone
in this family,

00:53.854 --> 00:55.654
it's gonna be
only Francine.
What?

00:55.656 --> 00:57.923
Don't talk back
to your father.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.548
(sighs) Just try to put
the ball through the hoop.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.016
No sweat.

01:24.018 --> 01:27.286
My peers don't call me
Swishy for nothing.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.455
(groans weakly)

01:29.457 --> 01:30.422
Wha!

01:30.424 --> 01:32.091
This is hopeless.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.759
How can we bond
if there's nothing

01:33.761 --> 01:36.428
Steve's good at
that we can bond over?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.364
I'm going inside.
Just put the ball away, please.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.805
(gasping)

01:46.807 --> 01:48.107
(ding!)

01:48.109 --> 01:49.942
That's it!

01:49.944 --> 01:53.545
I can teach Steve the basics
of electrical engineering!

01:53.547 --> 01:55.781
Oh, that's stupid.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.285

¶¶

02:33.954 --> 02:37.656
I found my ball.
I call her Whisper Willow.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.158
Okay...

02:39.160 --> 02:41.627
Now, a good roll
is all about the release.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.428
The release, of course.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.931
You can't hold on
to the ball.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.667
A bowler's ultimate goal
is to roll a strike,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.602
because you get
a hilarious little movie

02:50.604 --> 02:52.437
starring bowling-pin men!

02:57.878 --> 02:59.711
-Whoa!
-Cool beans!

02:59.713 --> 03:02.681
("Hail to the Chief" plays)

03:12.526 --> 03:14.793
Damn, son,
you're a natural!

03:14.795 --> 03:16.662
Here, I found us
some nachos.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.130
Mmm!

03:18.132 --> 03:20.666
I love the way the filth
from the finger holes

03:20.668 --> 03:22.401
mixes with
the synthetic cheese.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.536
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

03:24.538 --> 03:26.405
And blasting
all those pins

03:26.407 --> 03:28.373
must have made you
thirsty, too.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.908
What?
Are you -- really?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.343
Nothing wrong
with a father

03:31.345 --> 03:33.912
sharing a cold one
with his boy.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.981
(chuckles)

03:35.983 --> 03:39.051
These darn glasses seem
to be all fogged up.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.687
'Cause I'm not
seeing a thing.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.088
(ding!)

03:43.891 --> 03:45.357
Hanging out with you

03:45.359 --> 03:47.426
has been the most
awesome time ever, Dad.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.394
You know, I actually
feel the same way.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.063
Like -- like,
I'm not faking it

03:51.065 --> 03:53.065
and -- and your mom's not
making me say it.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.734
Would -- would it be weird
if I did this?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.403
Are --
Are we --

03:58.405 --> 03:59.738
Are we doing this?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.873
I think --
I think we are.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.141
We're hugging!

04:05.879 --> 04:07.546
(chuckling)
Well...

04:07.548 --> 04:11.083
I better get my gosh-darn
prescription checked...

04:11.085 --> 04:13.952
'cause I'm not seeing
anything here.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.587
(ding!)

04:22.396 --> 04:24.363
And not only
am I molding Steve

04:24.365 --> 04:26.865
into the best bowler
this side of Chimdale,

04:26.867 --> 04:30.435
he came up with, um, just
about the funniest joke names

04:30.437 --> 04:32.471
for the scoreboard
I've ever heard in my life.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.273
Isn't that right,
Mr. Butt?!

04:34.275 --> 04:36.742
Sure is, Dr. Balls!

04:36.744 --> 04:39.077
(both laughing)

04:39.079 --> 04:41.280
Oh, mmm!

04:41.282 --> 04:44.816
Do you have to hug after
every stupid thing you say?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.619
And there's a big father-son
tournament tomorrow night.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.421
We're pretty much
a lock to win.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.789
You guys should all come.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.791
-Ha.
-Roger, think you can make it?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.326
Yeah, of course,
you kidding me?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.994
I wouldn't miss it.
-That's great.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.063
And to the victory party
after the tournament?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.132
Tournament?
First I'm hearing of it.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.668
Oh, my God, Roger,
you have no attention span.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.136
(gasps)
How dare you!

05:05.105 --> 05:06.338
Leave it!

05:06.340 --> 05:08.774
Bald-ass alien
piece of shit.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.942
You're the one with
no attention span, Hayley!

05:10.944 --> 05:12.277
KLAUS:
I'll settle this!

05:12.279 --> 05:14.246
Now, here goes the fish.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.081
I propose a contest...

05:16.083 --> 05:19.484
that will settle which of you
has the worst attention span.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.421
And the contest is...

05:22.423 --> 05:23.789
T...

05:23.791 --> 05:25.357
B...

05:25.359 --> 05:27.592
D.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.531
(cheering)

05:32.533 --> 05:35.133
MAN: Let's hear it for Steve
and Stan Smith, folks --

05:35.135 --> 05:37.502
winners of this year's
father-son tournament.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.340
Schmueley, second place is
still pretty great, champ.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.342
Hey, that's not
that kid's dad!

05:43.344 --> 05:46.144
He's just a caring
and supportive friend
of the family!

05:46.146 --> 05:48.480
They're onto us!

05:48.482 --> 05:50.615
You did it, son!

05:50.617 --> 05:52.284
We did it, Dad.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.954
Hardly. You carried your father
like cheap luggage.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.389
How cheap we talking?

05:57.391 --> 05:59.391
-Nautica.
-I'll kill you!

05:59.393 --> 06:01.660
Mr. Smith,
your boy has a gift.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.729
But you've taken him
as far as you can.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.397
With
my coaching expertise,

06:05.399 --> 06:07.866
I can turn him
into the next Sid Bunch.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.502
Sid Bunch?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.304
The most famous bowler
of all time.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.406
He made the cover
of "Sports Illustrated."

06:16.343 --> 06:17.709
-Wow!
-Wow!

06:17.711 --> 06:19.511
But I don't know.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.480
Bowling is really
more just a fun thing

06:21.482 --> 06:22.881
me and my dad
do together.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.850
Yeah, I'm --
I'm not so sure, either.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.219
I understand.
There's nothing more beautiful

06:27.221 --> 06:29.654
than a father's love
for his son.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.260
So I guess...
this is goodbye.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.728
Except
bowling greatness!

06:36.730 --> 06:39.064
And we can get him there --
together.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.100
Team Steve.
What do you say?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.569
I guess I wouldn't want
to hold you back.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.706
And I'd end up being
a-a really great bowler.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.941
And we'd still be together.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.610
Right.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.678
So...
-So let's do it!

06:53.680 --> 06:55.547
Wait, how do I know
you're a good bowling coach?

06:55.549 --> 06:58.183
Would a bad bowling coach
have...this?!

06:58.185 --> 07:00.252
Would you accept
a blank check?

07:02.723 --> 07:04.356
I got it!

07:04.358 --> 07:06.958
The perfect test of your
attention-paying abilities.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.895
Hey, ding-a-ling,
pay attention, if you can.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.696
The winner will be
whoever makes it

07:11.698 --> 07:14.032
furthest through this --

07:14.034 --> 07:18.036
the 86-hour PBS series,
"Ken Burns' Bicycles,"

07:18.038 --> 07:21.039
a documentary so unwieldy
and meandering,

07:21.041 --> 07:24.042
Burns himself
has disavowed it.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.611
I found it
in a Goodwill --

07:26.613 --> 07:29.381
in between an old Teddy Ruxpin
and a baby coffin.

07:29.383 --> 07:32.851
Heads up, you are not gonna
find a better Goodwill.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.323
All the power of your roll
comes from your ankle.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.158
Now, I want you to shut
everything else out

07:40.160 --> 07:43.061
and focus intensely
on your ankle.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.132
(mysterious music plays)

07:49.770 --> 07:51.670
Should I roll
the ball now?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.205
You already have.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.944
Very good.
Now, roll again.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.779
-Mind that release, son!
-Whoop!

08:00.781 --> 08:02.848
(grunts)

08:02.850 --> 08:06.985
-(spider screeches)
-Nooooo!

08:06.987 --> 08:09.321
(sighs)

08:09.323 --> 08:11.656
Mr. Smith, I'm afraid
that from now on,

08:11.658 --> 08:13.358
these will be
closed practices.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.826
You --
you must be joking!

08:14.828 --> 08:16.127
I assure you, Mr. Smith,

08:16.129 --> 08:17.829
had I been making
an attempt at humor,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.865
I would have said,
"Boom shaka-laka."

08:19.867 --> 08:22.868
But I just ordered
a soft pretzel.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.936
Can I please wait for that,
at least?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.672
Sure...outside.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.608
Boom shaka-laka.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.018
All right, son, now,
remember what I taught you.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.019
You got it, Dad!

08:41.021 --> 08:42.687
Want some help rolling the ball?

08:42.689 --> 08:43.889
Sure do!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.959
Aah!

08:47.961 --> 08:51.062
It's just not the same
as bowling with Steve.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.397
Oh, honey.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.132
Just 'cause you're
not coaching Steve

08:54.134 --> 08:56.134
doesn't mean
you can't be with him.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.302
You can support him.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.537
Support him?

08:58.539 --> 09:01.806
Yes, I can cheer him on,
like a fan.

09:01.808 --> 09:04.042
His number-one fan!

09:04.044 --> 09:05.343
Oh, yeah!

09:05.345 --> 09:06.545
If you'll excuse me,

09:06.547 --> 09:08.513
I've got a bowling match
to get to.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.348
Wait -- match, contest?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.550
Never mind.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.052
You just worry
about that sink.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.988
You walk off, you lose.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.857
You doze off, you lose.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.193
The minute I push play,
it's Burns, baby, Burns!

09:22.195 --> 09:23.361
Scared?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.230
Sure you don't want
to pull out?

09:25.232 --> 09:28.433
News flash, bong brain,
I never pull out!

09:28.435 --> 09:29.901
Boom shaka-laka!
Ha ha.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.603
Now let's watch
this garbage.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.338
(violin playing)

09:33.340 --> 09:38.109
NARRATOR: "Woe be to the lost
art of perambulation...

09:38.111 --> 09:42.247
where those cherished
cobblestone thoroughfares

09:42.249 --> 09:45.183
where once we did walk,

09:45.185 --> 09:52.257
now do we pump, pedal,
and thus, truly, we fly."

09:52.593 --> 09:55.360
Walt Whitman.

09:55.362 --> 10:01.499
Oh, shi-i-i-i-i-i-t.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.205
Yeah-ha-ah!
Attaboy, Steve!

10:07.207 --> 10:09.107
Look how excited
my dad is.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.309
I mean, I miss
playing with him,

10:11.311 --> 10:13.945
but he obviously wants me
to be the best.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.480
Look how excited
Steve is.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.315
I mean, I miss
playing with him,

10:17.317 --> 10:19.417
but he obviously
wants to be the best.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.386
You gotta support
your kids, right?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.154
Even though
every time you cheer,

10:23.156 --> 10:25.657
it's like they're drifting
a little farther away from you.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.625
So true.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.226
You a bowling parent,
too?

10:28.228 --> 10:29.594
Oh, no!
I'm a pervert.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.596
Yep, just here
for the eye candy.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.965
So which boy is yours?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.734
Uh, the hot one, duh!

10:35.736 --> 10:38.303
¶¶

10:38.305 --> 10:40.238
Yay-hey-hey!

10:40.240 --> 10:41.239
Whoo!

10:41.241 --> 10:44.342
Yeah!

10:44.344 --> 10:46.678
They should call my boy
the Lumberjack

10:46.680 --> 10:49.147
the way he's chopping down
all that wood.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.682
Or Working Girl,

10:50.684 --> 10:54.252
the way he works those balls
so nice and sweet.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.855
You know what?
Let's stick with lumberjack.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.457
¶ Keep rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin' ¶

10:59.459 --> 11:02.127

Timber!

11:30.657 --> 11:32.123
What's wrong with Steve?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.491
He looks bummed.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.527
Maybe I'm not bringing
it hard enough.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.629
Come on, let's get it
going for Steve!

11:37.631 --> 11:39.330
I say, "Lumber,"
you say, "Jack!"

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
Lumber!

11:40.967 --> 11:43.501
Look, we just want to support
our own kids, okay?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.036
That's it, it's gorilla time!

11:47.474 --> 11:49.674
I'm an innocent man!

11:49.676 --> 11:52.177
(violin playing)

11:52.179 --> 11:56.581
NARRATOR: Adolphus Schwinn
next took his invention

11:56.583 --> 12:01.586
on tour to Quincy, Illinois;
Newport, Kentucky;

12:01.588 --> 12:06.191
Wheeling, West Virginia;
Utica, New York;

12:06.193 --> 12:11.730
Dorchester, Massachusetts;
back through Newport, Kentucky,

12:11.732 --> 12:14.999
then on to Portsmouth,
New Hampshire;

12:15.001 --> 12:18.770
and, finally,
Allegheny, Pennsylvania.

12:18.772 --> 12:23.374
But it was another discovery
in New Albany, Indiana,

12:23.376 --> 12:28.246
that was about to change
the bicycle forever.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.783
MAN: Now, you can't talk
about bicycles

12:31.785 --> 12:34.285
without talking about rubber.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.122
NARRATOR:
And talk about rubber, we shall,

12:37.124 --> 12:41.960
in the next 6-hour installment
of "Ken Burns' Bicycles."

12:41.962 --> 12:43.528
Wow.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.629
(whistle blows)

12:44.631 --> 12:45.697
Tape change!

12:45.699 --> 12:48.933
(groans)

12:48.935 --> 12:52.070
ANNOUNCER: Welcome
to the NBL Junior Invitational!

12:52.072 --> 12:54.239
The excitement
is palpable here.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.241
The stands,
absolutely packed

12:56.243 --> 12:58.810
with what I like to call
gutter people.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.111
(laughs)

13:00.113 --> 13:01.813
Delightful bowling
pun there, Greg.

13:01.815 --> 13:02.814
Bowling pun?

13:08.255 --> 13:10.755
Try to keep me from
the biggest tournament

13:10.757 --> 13:12.490
of Steve's life -- fat chance!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.259
He's gonna win this thing.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.262
And I'll be damned
if I'm not gonna be there

13:17.264 --> 13:20.131
to con-Taz-ulate my own son.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.338
Better hang out in the back
so as not to draw attention.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.744
What's your most
inconspicuous entrée?

13:32.746 --> 13:34.012
The chicken-fried steak

13:34.014 --> 13:36.147
ain't making
any lasting impressions.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.318
GREG: And the ball
is loose!

13:42.956 --> 13:44.656
GREG: It all comes down
to this.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.124
Knock down
just one more pin

13:46.126 --> 13:48.326
and you'll qualify for a spot
on the pro tour.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.028
That's right, Steve's days

13:50.030 --> 13:52.997
of bowling in lame-ass
father-son tournaments

13:52.999 --> 13:54.432
are about to be over.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.867
Oh, I didn't realize.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.203
But I guess
that's the sacrifice

13:58.205 --> 14:00.505
you have to make
to be the best.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.540
I've let this go too far.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.343
It's time
to make things right.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.058
(screams)

14:20.060 --> 14:21.292
ANNOUNCER: My God!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.127
The Lumberjack
has been stabbed!

14:23.129 --> 14:25.964
This is truly bowling's darkest,
most exciting day.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.733
(chuckles)

14:28.735 --> 14:30.969
Shh.
I'm right here with you.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.072
(gasps)
How bad is it, coach?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.640
Career-ending!

14:35.642 --> 14:38.576
Goodbye forever, Steve.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.311
(horn blares, tires screech)

14:40.313 --> 14:42.180
(crash!)

14:42.182 --> 14:44.382
What?!
What happened?!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.050
What have I done?!

14:46.052 --> 14:48.119
Oh, my God!
(gasps)

14:51.725 --> 14:54.626
I stabbed my son!

15:02.168 --> 15:04.569
I still can't believe
I stabbed my own son!

15:04.571 --> 15:06.237
But that's all in the past now.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.207
You've got your boy back,
so now you're just gonna focus

15:09.209 --> 15:11.910
on reconnecting with him
and never letting him go.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.878
You don't tell Steve
about this,

15:13.880 --> 15:15.213
and I won't tell Klaus

15:15.215 --> 15:17.515
you're the one who broke
his Dilbert mug.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.850
Okay, deal, deal!

15:20.954 --> 15:22.186
Hey, there, slugger!

15:22.188 --> 15:24.255
Want to work
on a Lego set together

15:24.257 --> 15:26.457
or go down to the
Whole Foods buffet,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.293
pick up some slops
and stews?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.061
Maybe get
super into jazz --

15:30.063 --> 15:32.196
father and son,
two big jazz heads.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.765
Actually, all
I really want to do

15:33.767 --> 15:35.266
is figure out
who attacked me.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.101
What if this sicko
tries again?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.938
I'm pretty sure
the stabber's stabbing days

15:39.940 --> 15:42.307
are behind Stan --
him -- it!

15:42.309 --> 15:43.708
You sound like the cops.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.910
They've given up
on the case already, too.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.046
To them, I'm just
one more white kid

15:48.048 --> 15:50.081
who got stabbed
in a bowling alley.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.482
Ah, what are you
gonna do?

15:51.484 --> 15:53.117
Let's home-brew
some root beer.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.753
But -- well, you're kind of
a detective --

15:55.755 --> 15:57.822
you know,
working for the C.I.A.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.625
Maybe you could help me
investigate, as a...

16:00.627 --> 16:02.126
Team?!
Team Steve?!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.127
Let me think.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.729
From what I recall,

16:04.731 --> 16:07.298
the stabber covered
<i> her</i> tracks perfectly,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.168
so, yeah, father-son time,
let's do it.

16:11.838 --> 16:16.007
Okay. This is where
the attack occurred.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.241
(screams)

16:17.243 --> 16:18.543
Hmm.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.246
(gasps)
Look!

16:22.248 --> 16:24.782
These must be
the stabber's footprints!

16:24.784 --> 16:27.118
See?! They're the only ones
with a tread.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.088
Bowling shoes
are smooth.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.790
And the shoe prints
continue out here,

16:32.792 --> 16:35.360
which means we can track
where the stabber went!

16:35.362 --> 16:37.595
Wait, since when
is Steve smart?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.031
He's a jock.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.468
NARRATOR: And who knows
what the future holds

16:43.470 --> 16:45.269
for the humble bicycle.

16:45.271 --> 16:49.507
Maybe a basket
to put all your stuff in.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.975
The end.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.310
(sniffles)

16:52.312 --> 16:53.678
So beautiful.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.779
(snoring)

16:54.781 --> 16:56.214
(whistle blows)

16:56.216 --> 16:58.016
Wha-- what's going on?!
Did -- did I win?

16:58.018 --> 17:01.152
Roger, you made it
through the whole thing.

17:01.154 --> 17:04.555
Kudos!

17:04.557 --> 17:06.491
(air gushing)

17:06.493 --> 17:08.793
(both screaming)

17:08.795 --> 17:10.528
Wait a minute.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.198
(laughing)

17:14.200 --> 17:15.400
(both scream)

17:15.402 --> 17:17.301
What are you doing
in my room?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.370
Are you serious?
The contest!

17:19.372 --> 17:22.140
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I got bored.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.574
That's why I molted

17:23.576 --> 17:25.476
and came in here
to watch "Yas Cat" videos.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.644
Molt and bolt, baby.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.745
Ha!
-Oh, snap!

17:27.747 --> 17:28.746
Is that a new
"Bad Lip Synch"?

17:28.748 --> 17:30.214
Oh, tight.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.651
Look at the two of you.
You're pathetic!

17:33.653 --> 17:35.520
No, Klaus.
I realized something

17:35.522 --> 17:38.489
about two days into whatever
it was we were watching.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.757
A short attention span

17:39.759 --> 17:41.526
is not something
to be ashamed of,

17:41.528 --> 17:43.261
it's something
to be proud of --

17:43.263 --> 17:45.730
like owning a sous-vide
or having big old tits.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.698
Throughout history,
it's been people

17:47.700 --> 17:49.067
with short attention spans

17:49.069 --> 17:51.903
who've been responsible
for...culture

17:51.905 --> 17:56.007
and inventions that, um,
have changed the course of...

17:56.009 --> 17:58.042
What are we
talking about?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.544
You were...
Uh...

17:59.546 --> 18:01.212
Didn't you
ask me something?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.747
-I thought -- what?
-Huh?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.849
I'm sorry,
I don't believe we've met.

18:04.851 --> 18:05.917
My name is Roger.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.620
You're digging
through trash, son.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.923
No judge is going to admit
garbage as evidence.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.924
It's gross.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.225
This Dumpster
is filled

18:14.227 --> 18:15.793
with weapons
and blood-soaked hoodies.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.562
How am I supposed
to find the ones

18:17.564 --> 18:18.963
that belong
to my stabber?

18:18.965 --> 18:20.531
Hey!

18:20.533 --> 18:22.533
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.136
Aha! I distinctly
remember the stabber

18:25.138 --> 18:27.405
reeking
of chicken-fried steak.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.539
(inhales deeply)

18:28.541 --> 18:29.974
Just like this hoodie!

18:29.976 --> 18:31.075
And, look!

18:31.077 --> 18:33.211
It's a receipt
for a custom

18:33.213 --> 18:35.646
"Con-Taz-ulations,
Steve!" cake.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.215
This Taz-loving sicko

18:37.217 --> 18:39.617
must have really
been obsessed with me.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.220
Find that cake and
we'll find our stabber.

18:51.664 --> 18:55.766
You...were the one
who stabbed me?!

18:55.768 --> 18:57.468
Where's your proof?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.971
Damn it!

18:59.973 --> 19:01.506
Why would you do this?!

19:01.508 --> 19:03.441
The edge pieces
have the most icing.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.443
No!
Stabbing me!

19:05.445 --> 19:06.811
I don't know!

19:06.813 --> 19:09.347
We had such a good thing
going for a while,

19:09.349 --> 19:11.516
and -- and then
I started to lose you.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.851
And -- and when I heard
I'd never be able

19:13.853 --> 19:15.153
to bowl with you again,
I -- I...

19:15.155 --> 19:16.687
I just snapped.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.023
Can you ever forgive me
and also not tell the police?!

19:19.025 --> 19:21.659
(sighs)
Yes.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.594
But you didn't have
to stab me.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.862
I didn't?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.532
Well, what?
Of course you didn't!

19:27.534 --> 19:29.934
There could never be
a reason to st--

19:29.936 --> 19:32.537
Never mind.
What I mean is...

19:32.539 --> 19:34.605
I was gonna gutter ball
that last roll.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.507
What?! Why?!

19:36.509 --> 19:38.643
You had a chance to go pro,
to be the best!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.478
I thought that was
what you wanted.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.946
I never cared
about that.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.881
I wanted things to go back
to how they were

19:43.883 --> 19:45.816
when it was just you and me
having fun.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.185
That's what I wanted.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.553
It was?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.321
Is that why
you were acting so weird?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.656
Weird?! How?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.391
Stabbing me
comes to mind!

19:53.393 --> 19:56.160
You're just never gonna let me
live that down, are you?

19:56.162 --> 19:58.462
Come on, look, getting stabbed
is not that big a deal.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.997
See? Bop!
See, nothing?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.332
Bop!
Bop, bop, bop!

20:01.334 --> 20:02.900
No biggie.
Do it in the back.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.635
Bop, bop!
I'm fine, see?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.370
Few more?
Bop, bop, bop.

20:11.077 --> 20:14.011
It's possible that some of this
could have been avoided.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.913
You know
where the breakdown was?

20:15.915 --> 20:16.847
In your mental state?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.349
In our communication.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.318
We both just wanted
to spend time together.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.919
And if we'd been open
about that,

20:21.921 --> 20:23.521
none of this
would have happened.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.256
So you swear
you're not upset

20:25.258 --> 20:27.525
that I'm never gonna
be the best bowler?

20:27.527 --> 20:29.827
Yes. Because you're already
the best son.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.929
At least,
the best I've ever had.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.764
Mmm!

20:33.766 --> 20:35.266
Let's agree
that from now on,

20:35.268 --> 20:37.535
before we assume we know
what the other person wants,

20:37.537 --> 20:39.537
that we'll talk to each other
about it first.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.705
You got it.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.873
Excuse me.
Langley Falls P.D.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.508
I couldn't help
but observe

20:44.510 --> 20:47.078
Steve's detective work
back at the bowling alley.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.413
Your boy's got a gift.
With my expertise --

20:49.415 --> 20:50.881
He would love to.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.451
(bird squawking loudly)

20:53.453 --> 20:54.285
Hmm!

20:54.287 --> 20:56.287
(retches)

20:56.289 --> 20:58.256
(sobbing)

20:58.258 --> 20:59.690
Whose kid is this?!

20:59.692 --> 21:02.193
Who would let their kid
see this?!

21:02.195 --> 21:04.195
Have a great night.
