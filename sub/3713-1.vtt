00:59.627 --> 01:01.560
<i>I believe in happy endings.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:04.430
And it's the only thing
that's ever made sense to me.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.198
You know, I used to
lock myself in my room

01:06.200 --> 01:08.534
and watch all the oldies on PBS.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.302
We couldn't afford cable,
which was fine.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.404
You know, who needs to watch
shows on teenage pregnancy

01:12.406 --> 01:15.074
and kids living in the same house
screaming at each other?

01:15.076 --> 01:18.210
In my neighborhood, that
was called wednesday.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.580
Well, I used to escape with
Spencer Tracy and Kate Hepburn

01:21.582 --> 01:24.416
and Fred Astaire spinning
Ginger Rogers on the dance floor

01:24.418 --> 01:28.087
and Bogie finally plant
one on Lauren Bacall.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.089
All in glorious black and white.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.824
You like fairy tales?

01:31.826 --> 01:34.660
I think we all need a little magic
from time to time, don't you think?

01:34.662 --> 01:36.295
I mean, what would
Lana Turner have done

01:36.297 --> 01:38.130
if Mervyn Leroy had
never gone into Schwab's

01:38.132 --> 01:39.331
on Hollywood and Vine

01:39.333 --> 01:40.866
and he saw her there,
drinking that coke.

01:40.868 --> 01:44.103
She was discovered right there,
and that coke changed her life.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.338
Well, so they tell the tourists,

01:46.340 --> 01:47.873
because it wasn't Schwab's

01:47.875 --> 01:51.210
It was actually a place called
top hat on Sunset and McCadden.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.995
And it wasn't Mervyn Leroy,

01:52.996 --> 01:54.779
<i>it was actually a guy from
the Hollywood Reporter.</i>

01:54.782 --> 01:56.615
And her name wasn't
even Lana Turner then.

01:56.617 --> 02:00.152
It was Judy... Actually
her real name was Julia.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.355
But you knew all that, right?

02:03.357 --> 02:07.192
You know, it doesn't really
have the same magic, though.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.713
<i>So you think you
got here by magic?</i>

02:27.715 --> 02:29.882
In its purest form.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.417
I mean, there are
a thousand, no...

02:32.419 --> 02:35.220
There are a million
lefts or rights.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.222
Picking up instead
of dodging a call.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.491
Deciding on indian
instead of italian.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.694
You know, willing yourself to go
out, when all you want to do is sleep.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.863
I can almost trace it back
to the very first step.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.866
Blows my mind...

02:47.868 --> 02:52.938
To think that just like Lana, a
chance encounter changed my life.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.508
<i>Of course, I always thought
the guy who would change my life</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:59.444
<i>would be powerful
like Marlon Brando</i>

02:59.446 --> 03:01.747
<i>or sparkle like Cary Grant</i>

03:01.749 --> 03:05.417
<i>or smell like worn
leather like James Dean.</i>

03:05.419 --> 03:07.686
Mr. Albertson, do you
need me for anything else?

03:07.688 --> 03:10.189
-I'm good. Fine. Thank you.
-Okay.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.292
<i>You never think it
will just be some guy</i>

03:14.395 --> 03:18.497
<i>who looks like some guy</i>

03:18.499 --> 03:20.566
<i>who's just as screwed
up as the rest of us.</i>

03:20.568 --> 03:23.502
Hello. I think I've a
reservation. Derek Thomas.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.838
Yes, Mr. Thomas.
You're in suite 1369.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.874
-Okay.
-Bellman.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.376
-Thank you.
-Sure. Right this way.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.378
-Where'd you fly in from?
-Los Angeles.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.214
L.A. I've always
wanted to go there.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.615
A lot of pretty girls.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.384
Of course, there are a lot
of pretty girls everywhere.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.386
That's one of the nice
things about the world.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.222
So have you stayed
with us before, sir?

03:43.224 --> 03:45.224
Yeah.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.792
So, how's the
weather out there now?

03:46.794 --> 03:50.629
You know, it's always
oppressively perfect.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.465
Well, look who's here!

03:53.467 --> 03:55.701
Seth, my darling. I thought
you were staying at the Pierre.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.502
And I thought you
were at your in-laws.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.938
No, not till tomorrow. That's
when Delta and the kids arrive.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.908
I can't handle her
parents by myself.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.843
-Man's best friend.
-This is Wilba.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.712
So what are you doing
later? You want some dinner?

04:06.714 --> 04:08.914
No, I'm so worn out.
Exhausted.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.482
You know, jet lag
and everything.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.251
It was a very tough
little picture.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.319
No sleep. Hurt my back.

04:14.321 --> 04:17.488
I better just take an epsom
salt bath and go straight to bed.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.361
Goodnight. I will
see you at Rehearsals.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.596
And why are you getting off?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.565
I'm on this floor. 1317.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.800
That's convenient. Okay.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.435
I'm going to turn in.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.838
Well, it's comforting to
know my director's close by.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.940
-Love to Delta.
-Okay.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.843
Actors...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.645
Yeah, I know what you
mean. I'm an actor!

04:39.647 --> 04:41.513
There's something special
about them, isn't there?

04:44.518 --> 04:45.751
That's just what I meant.

04:45.752 --> 04:46.985
What? We don't want to
buy anything so forget it!

04:46.987 --> 04:49.021
I was raised in Brooklyn
with my parents,

04:49.023 --> 04:51.423
which was tough, you know.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.825
They stopped believing in
happy endings a long time ago.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.861
Shut up! I can handle this.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.596
No! You shut up.

04:57.598 --> 04:58.797
But I try not to blame them.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.299
Things started
out great for them,

05:00.301 --> 05:02.801
like ma was crowned
miss Coney Island, 1974,

05:02.803 --> 05:04.369
All because of pops.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.971
He was one of the judges?

05:05.973 --> 05:07.873
No. He was selling the
hot-dogs on the boardwalk,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.809
but he watched the entire
pageant, and he sees my ma,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.078
And he falls for
her, like, hard.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.382
So he starts putting all this
rotten mustard in all the hot-dogs

05:17.384 --> 05:19.818
and my ma is the only one
who doesn't run off the stage

05:19.820 --> 05:21.453
clutching her stomach, so...

05:21.455 --> 05:22.654
That sealed it.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.490
But he had a million ideas

05:25.492 --> 05:27.826
and he used to promise my ma that
it was only gonna be a matter of time

05:27.828 --> 05:29.061
before one of them hit.

05:29.063 --> 05:32.664
So she got a job washing
hair in a beauty salon

05:32.666 --> 05:34.599
and she was waiting
and waiting...

05:34.601 --> 05:37.436
And you know, twenty years go
by and she's still washing hair.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.104
What does he do, your father?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.505
He invents things.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.940
Like what?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.475
Do you know the glue stick?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.710
He invented that?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.511
No. He invented
the butter stick,

05:46.513 --> 05:49.548
so you smooth it on
your toast real good.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.485
But... I mean, it
was huge in Japan.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.786
<i>Hello, Vickie's.</i>

05:54.788 --> 05:56.922
Hi, Vickie. I'm
over at the Barclay

05:56.924 --> 05:59.509
and I was calling
about the availability

05:59.510 --> 06:02.094
of one of your escorts
for this evening.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.662
<i>Which one is that, sir?</i>

06:03.664 --> 06:06.431
From the webpage here.
Glo.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.568
Can you hold on just
one minute? I'm sorry.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.669
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

06:13.507 --> 06:15.073
<i>-Hello?
-Mr. Albertson.</i>

06:15.075 --> 06:17.542
Who's this? Who is it?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.378
<i>It's me, dad. It's David.</i>

06:19.380 --> 06:21.480
David. Where are you?

06:21.482 --> 06:24.449
<i>Home. Geez, dad, where
do you think I am?</i>

06:24.451 --> 06:26.418
<i>We're getting ready to leave.</i>

06:26.420 --> 06:29.154
You're leaving? I thought you guys
weren't arriving until tomorrow.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.390
<i>Yeah, dad, we're
just going to dinner.</i>

06:31.392 --> 06:34.092
Okay. David, do me a
favor and put your mom on.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.395
<i>Mom? I thought mom was with you.</i>

06:36.397 --> 06:38.764
<i>-What?
-I'm kidding, dad.</i>

06:38.766 --> 06:41.633
<i>-Just a minute.
-Hold it, David.</i>

06:45.139 --> 06:48.507
I'm sorry, just one
more minute, Vickie.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.950
<i>You know, I really can't.</i>

06:49.951 --> 06:51.445
<i>Why don't I see
if Glo can do it?</i>

06:51.446 --> 06:53.709
Great. Yeah! That,
that and, and see if she

06:53.710 --> 06:55.714
can maybe come in
the next hour or so.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.717
<i>If I can reach her. I'll call you back.
What room are you in?</i>

06:58.719 --> 07:01.620
1369. The name's Derek Thomas.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.654
Thank you.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.058
<i>-Hey, David.
-No, it's Josie.</i>

07:07.060 --> 07:08.827
<i>And I'm kinda tired
of waiting, dad.</i>

07:08.829 --> 07:11.730
I'm sorry, Josie.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.767
<i>Hold on. Hold it.
I know. Hold it. Dad!</i>

07:17.805 --> 07:19.638
<i>-Hello?
-Hi, Arnold.</i>

07:19.639 --> 07:21.472
<i>I just wanted to confirm
the time for tomorrow...</i>

07:21.475 --> 07:23.208
No, no, Seth. It's not tomorrow.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.777
It's the day after
tomorrow. At noon.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.679
<i>-At the belasco?
-That's right.</i>

07:27.681 --> 07:29.614
<i>-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.</i>

07:32.186 --> 07:33.885
Sorry about that, Josie.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.154
<i>Hey, no, it's me.</i>

07:36.156 --> 07:37.756
Delta, how are you?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.927
Delta, I'm sorry, it's
room service. Just a second.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.797
<i>-Hello?
-Hello, who's this?</i>

07:45.799 --> 07:47.199
<i>-This is Arnold.
-Arnold?</i>

07:47.201 --> 07:49.501
I mean, this is Derek. Vickie?

07:49.503 --> 07:50.969
Yes. Why did you say Arnold?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.805
I didn't... You know,
just 'cause they...

07:53.807 --> 07:55.474
Derek, Arnold,
they sound alike.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.908
Or almost same
amount of letters.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.243
<i>What?</i>

07:58.245 --> 08:00.912
You know, like a joke.
Like it's my indian name.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.714
<i>-Are you indian?
-Honorary.</i>

08:02.716 --> 08:04.716
Can you hold for just a minute?

08:04.717 --> 08:06.118
<i>No, you know what,
I'm just keeping you posted.</i>

08:06.119 --> 08:08.718
<i>Glo's phone is busy. I'll keep
trying. I'll call you back.</i>

08:08.722 --> 08:10.522
Good. Good.
Keep trying. Okay.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.826
Delta, I'm sorry.
How are you?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.495
<i>Fine. Who were you talking to?</i>

08:16.497 --> 08:19.531
Just room service.
My back has been killing me.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.701
But how are you?

08:22.702 --> 08:24.769
<i>I'm a little nervous.
I can't believe it's been seven years</i>

08:24.770 --> 08:26.837
<i>since I've been on a stage.
I don't think I can sleep tonight.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.874
Me too. Me too.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.776
I'm just going to take a bath
and head straight to bed.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.746
I'll get it.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.248
It's always for you anyway.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.116
Hello? Hi, Vickie.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.751
Who is it?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.153
It's my boss, mom.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.188
Can't they never
leave you alone?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.924
<i>I'm trying to earn
a living, okay?</i>

08:45.926 --> 08:47.225
<i>Hi, Vickie, what's up?</i>

08:47.227 --> 08:48.760
When can you get to Manhattan?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.695
Maybe an hour.
Give me an hour.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.130
Great. You got a pencil?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.766
-Here's the name. Derek. D-E-R...
-I can spell it.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.902
Okay. Thomas, room 1369.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.803
Okay, got it.
Where'd you say?

08:58.805 --> 09:00.705
<i>-The Barclay.
-Done.</i>

09:00.707 --> 09:02.574
So the rumors are true?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.142
-You really did work as a...
-A muse?

09:05.546 --> 09:06.945
A what?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.280
A muse.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.550
That's a real job?

09:11.552 --> 09:14.252
Yeah.
It was for me.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.922
<i>My clients were
mostly poor souls.</i>

09:16.924 --> 09:18.857
<i>Completely empty of magic.</i>

09:18.859 --> 09:22.794
<i>So it was my job to
breathe life back into them.</i>

09:22.796 --> 09:25.897
<i>-Look!
-You make a person feel special.</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:29.034
<i>You treat them like they're the
most important thing in the world.</i>

09:29.036 --> 09:30.969
<i>And for an hour...</i>

09:30.971 --> 09:32.871
<i>They are.</i>

09:34.708 --> 09:37.042
<i>There was one particular
client which...</i>

09:37.044 --> 09:39.844
<i>I'll tell you more
about him in a minute.</i>

09:39.846 --> 09:44.649
<i>He hired a private eye, called
him a gumshoe, to follow me.</i>

09:44.651 --> 09:46.718
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

09:46.719 --> 09:48.786
<i>It was kind of flattering
that someone wanted to know</i>

09:48.789 --> 09:50.755
<i>where I was all the time.</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:11.176
Okay.
Hold it.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.086
Who is it?

10:21.088 --> 10:22.854
It's me.
It's Glo.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.824
-Hi. Hello.
-Hi, how are you?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.583
Good.
Glo, right?

10:27.584 --> 10:29.361
Yeah. That's right,
but don't wear it out.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.363
Say, can I use your bathroom?

10:31.365 --> 10:34.065
Yeah. It's right,
it's right over there.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.138
-Hello?
-Derek? Is she there yet?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.806
<i>Yeah, she's in the bathroom.</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:44.342
But, hold on.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.277
Glo, I'm sorry.
It's Vickie.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.914
Yeah... Tell her
I'll be right there.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.417
Vickie, she'll be
right there... Here.

10:52.419 --> 10:55.820
Here she is. Okay.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.256
-Hi.
-Why didn't you call?

10:58.257 --> 11:00.691
<i>I had to go. I'm fine.
I'll call you in an hour.</i>

11:00.694 --> 11:03.762
You know, it could
be more than an hour.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.064
He says it could be
more than an hour.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.767
Well, then have him pay you now
for two hours, and see how it goes.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.834
<i>Okay.</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:13.355
<i>-Hi.
-Pay her now for two hours</i>

11:13.356 --> 11:15.340
<i>and see how it goes.
And I'll call you back in two hours.</i>

11:15.342 --> 11:17.075
Okay. Sounds good.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.712
Can I get you a glass of wine?

11:20.714 --> 11:23.281
Sure. Yeah. You want
jasmine, citrus, or pear?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.216
-What?
-Lotion? Foot rub?

11:25.218 --> 11:27.819
No, no, no. I just
put my socks on.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.021
Well, I can't rub your feet if you're
going to be wearing socks.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.756
No, no. I thought
maybe we could go out.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.758
-We're going out?
-Yeah, let's go to dinner.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.895
-Wh... Are you serious?
-Yeah. Come on.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.964
You mean, we're going to go
out and then we come back again?

11:39.966 --> 11:43.468
Yeah, you know, it could be three
hours, it could be four hours.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.737
Big spender.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.372
Where do you want to
go? Are you hungry?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.741
Yeah, I know a place.
Do you like indian?

11:49.743 --> 11:51.076
-Okay.
-You don't like indian?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.011
No, no, I love it. I
love it. Yeah, yeah.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.113
-Not too spicy.
-No, mild.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.386
That was not mild.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.222
How about a carriage ride?

12:04.224 --> 12:07.058
-I could use the air.
-Fun!

12:12.466 --> 12:14.265
Derek...

12:14.267 --> 12:16.901
How come you're such a nice guy?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.837
-Me? I am?
-Yeah.

12:18.839 --> 12:22.273
Yeah, you are. You're a
real nice guy, you know.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.375
No other client ever
took me for a drink,

12:24.377 --> 12:27.445
or for a meal or a
buggy ride, you know?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.814
They just want to, you know,
"wham, bam", thank you, ma'am.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.284
I guess, I'm the romantic type.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.121
Yeah, you are.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.056
You are.
You are a romantic guy.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.459
What do you want to do?
I mean, besides this.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.928
What do you want to do?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.964
I want...

12:45.966 --> 12:48.399
I want to act, you know.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.201
Yeah, I want to be an actress.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.337
But then, of course, my dad
thinks I'm on cloud nine

12:52.339 --> 12:54.072
-with the whole acting thing.
-Why?

12:54.074 --> 12:56.274
'Cause it's like I just do
this as a way to earn a living

12:56.276 --> 12:58.343
while I wait until
my break, you know.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.112
Also help my folks out a little.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.782
Well, maybe there's a
better way to earn a living.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.951
Well, you know, you date guys...

13:07.487 --> 13:09.287
What do they want?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.089
They want you in the sack.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.091
So this way, guys I meet,
that's all they want, too,

13:13.093 --> 13:14.826
but at least they're
gonna pay for it.

13:14.828 --> 13:18.396
You know, you meet a guy and
they expect it for nothing.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.232
So this way I figure
I'm ahead of the game.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.870
But it doesn't really
make me feel good, really.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.106
I think you're terrific.

13:37.317 --> 13:43.488
You know, you are the most
detailed kind of lover!

13:43.490 --> 13:46.124
-Detailed?
-Yeah.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.227
Like... That was amazing.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.231
I really like you.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.001
Listen...

13:57.003 --> 13:58.570
You wanna make a deal with me?

13:58.572 --> 14:01.506
What kinda deal?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.575
No, no, no. I'm,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

14:03.577 --> 14:07.145
But if you... If you
promise me tonight, solemnly,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.479
on your word of honor,

14:08.481 --> 14:11.182
that you'll never do this again,

14:11.184 --> 14:15.987
I'll give you $30,000.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.990
What... To have sex?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.925
No, no, you know, for money.

14:20.927 --> 14:25.163
Promise me you'll only do it when you,
when you like someone, or for love.

14:25.165 --> 14:29.200
What you're gonna give
me $30,000 for that?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.902
Yeah.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.404
I mean, it'll give you a
fresh start on your acting,

14:33.406 --> 14:35.506
and whatever you want to do.

14:35.508 --> 14:39.244
You are a romantic guy!

14:39.246 --> 14:42.447
But you're not really serious?

14:42.449 --> 14:45.250
No, I'm serious. It's,
it's in the suitcase.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.987
No strings attached,
I promise. I just...

14:48.989 --> 14:50.288
I think you're great.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.058
I do.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.629
You're kinda the
first one, you know?

14:57.631 --> 15:01.432
Like, my, my dad always said that
I was just crazy for wanting to act

15:01.434 --> 15:03.902
and he said it was never
going to be "my place in life",

15:03.904 --> 15:05.370
He called it.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.538
-And my mom, too.
-That's ridiculous.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.507
Nobody can tell you
where your place is.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.577
Where's my place?
Where's anybody's place.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.146
You want to know where it is?
Wherever you're happy.

15:15.148 --> 15:19.150
That's where your place is.
And you're the best judge of that.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.552
In central park, for instance,

15:21.554 --> 15:24.322
some people like to feed
nuts to the squirrels.

15:24.324 --> 15:29.193
But if it makes someone happy
to feed squirrels to the nuts,

15:29.195 --> 15:31.496
who am I to say nuts
to the squirrels?

15:33.133 --> 15:35.500
-That is just terrific!
-It's good, right.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.438
Say, could you,
could you kiss me again?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.340
Before the 30 grand?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.949
You know, this man,
this beautiful person,

15:50.951 --> 15:53.318
all he wanted to do
was care for me.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.419
For me...

15:55.188 --> 15:57.055
And he did.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.591
And he changed my life,
in a New York minute.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.093
You know, I think I felt
something for him

16:02.095 --> 16:03.661
that I never felt
for anybody before.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.729
Love?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.433
Gratitude.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.002
He inspired me the way
that I inspired my clients.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.372
Even a muse needs a muse.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.246
I'll miss you, Glo...

16:22.248 --> 16:23.348
I mean, Izzy.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.183
No, I'll miss you...

16:31.124 --> 16:32.256
You have a good trip.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.758
Okay. Be safe.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.729
You know, I'll never
forget you, Derek.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.097
Me too.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.656
Justin!

16:48.657 --> 16:50.674
<i>That client I told you
about earlier, was a judge.</i>

16:50.677 --> 16:55.113
And he couldn't write his
judgments or opinions or whatever.

16:55.115 --> 17:00.018
So, I worked with him a little bit
and yeah, totally helped him out.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.154
<i>The problem is that when
you inspire people</i>

17:03.156 --> 17:07.191
<i>they want to keep getting
inspired, over and over again.</i>

17:07.193 --> 17:09.060
<i>Sometimes for hours.</i>

17:09.061 --> 17:11.762
<i>It's like a drug.
Highly addictive.</i>

17:11.765 --> 17:14.232
<i>If you don't get it,
you start to go batty.</i>

17:14.233 --> 17:16.501
<i>Hello, this is Vickie's.
We're not here right now,</i>

17:16.502 --> 17:18.435
<i>but leave a message and
we'll call you back soon.</i>

17:19.539 --> 17:21.571
Hello, Vickie?
This is Dr. Dolittle.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.540
<i>-You can't call me...
-Hello, hello, Doc.</i>

17:23.542 --> 17:26.743
Why are you whispering?
Where are you? Niagara falls?

17:26.746 --> 17:30.481
No, no, no. But I just
had to call you because...

17:30.483 --> 17:33.751
Glo... You know. I
need to see her again.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.820
<i>-She's quit.
-Quit?</i>

17:35.822 --> 17:38.623
<i>-What do you mean, quit?
-Quit means quit.</i>

17:38.625 --> 17:40.224
Now, would you
like anybody else?

17:40.226 --> 17:42.226
I have a very nice
blond I can send over.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.362
Not now.
I'll call back.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.836
<i>This is Dr. Vivian Claremont.</i>

17:52.839 --> 17:56.841
<i>I have gone on sabbatical and
will be in Tuscany for six months.</i>

17:56.843 --> 17:59.844
<i>Any of you who need immediate
help may speak to my daughter,</i>

17:59.846 --> 18:03.548
<i>who is very empathetic,
her name is Jane Claremont.</i>

18:03.550 --> 18:05.850
<i>In an emergency,
call her cellphone.</i>

18:11.191 --> 18:13.224
<i>Eight million people in New York</i>

18:13.226 --> 18:16.227
<i>and it seems like
everyone knows everyone.</i>

18:16.229 --> 18:19.630
Will somebody answer
their God damn phone?

18:19.632 --> 18:23.234
Didn't your mother leave
you an emergency line?

18:23.236 --> 18:25.019
Shit! Shit!

18:25.020 --> 18:26.803
<i>I like to think that coincidence
is a way of reminding us</i>

18:26.806 --> 18:28.806
<i>that there's somebody up
there with a master plan.</i>

18:28.808 --> 18:30.258
Yes? Hello?
Who is it?

18:30.259 --> 18:31.709
<i>Hello, is this the
Claremont daughter?</i>

18:31.711 --> 18:32.877
Yes. Who is it?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.246
Well, I'm having a
bit of an emergency.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.149
An emergency? All right, you
probably just think it's an emergency!

18:38.151 --> 18:40.885
I have just dropped all of my stuff
on the street in New York City.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.121
Now, that is an emergency!
What's yours?

18:43.123 --> 18:47.158
Well, I'm, I'm having a problem.
It's kind of an obsession...

18:47.160 --> 18:48.526
<i>An obsession?</i>

18:48.528 --> 18:50.728
All right, can I just tell
you something from experience,

18:50.730 --> 18:53.397
obsessions are not emergencies.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.666
They stick with
you your entire life

18:55.668 --> 18:58.269
so you better just face it, that
this thing is going to be with you

18:58.271 --> 19:00.671
for a really long time.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.507
<i>Either you just
have to get over it,</i>

19:02.509 --> 19:04.642
or deal with it, all right?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.411
So, if you would like to call me
during office hours, that's fine.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.846
I work monday, tuesday,

19:08.848 --> 19:11.215
not wednesday morning,
which is right now.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.384
<i>Not thursday mornings,
which is tomorrow.</i>

19:13.386 --> 19:14.599
So you can call
me this afternoon,

19:14.600 --> 19:16.420
tomorrow afternoon or
friday all day, all right?

19:16.422 --> 19:18.456
I don't want to be
bothered with nonsense.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.224
Please, you're a grown man.
Grow up!

19:26.332 --> 19:28.432
Me, me, me...

19:28.434 --> 19:29.667
Me, me, me, me, me.

19:33.173 --> 19:36.207
Joshua! Please, please,
can you just hold the dog?

19:36.209 --> 19:39.510
Please. I'm on the phone,
I'm dealing with emergencies.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.547
People need me. I'm a
caregiver, it's what I do and...

19:42.549 --> 19:45.650
Well, then, you know, you should
really try to be more polite to people.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.920
What is it with you today?

19:48.922 --> 19:50.855
Did someone take a
piss in your cornflakes?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.457
Nothing. I'm just a little
nervous about tomorrow's casting.

19:54.694 --> 19:58.863
What is the big
deal? It shouldn't...

19:58.865 --> 20:02.366
-I told you to please not call...
-No, it's my phone.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.602
It's not a good
time right now, dad.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.606
I cannot believe you're
talking to your father.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.274
-He just called.
-Your father!

20:10.276 --> 20:12.310
-I'm calling him back.
-Please!

20:12.312 --> 20:14.679
He calls you all the... It's like
its father's day with you every day!

20:14.681 --> 20:16.380
I mean, the guy calls
you all the time!

20:16.382 --> 20:18.316
-No, he doesn't.
-It's a little weird.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.384
-Honestly, I'm getting fed up with it.
-He's called me once.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.820
In fact, I am fed up with it.
I'm out of here.

20:22.822 --> 20:23.988
Taxi!

20:23.990 --> 20:25.456
Taxi!

20:25.458 --> 20:27.525
Don't you want your
dog or your bags?

20:29.662 --> 20:32.663
You are the rudest person
I have ever met.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.334
Come on.
Come on, shep.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.103
Taxi!

20:39.104 --> 20:41.871
<i>Maybe that judge or Dr. Jane
wasn't as nutty as I remember.</i>

20:43.476 --> 20:44.742
Good girl.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.945
<i>But memory isn't a video camera.</i>

20:47.947 --> 20:49.814
<i>Is it?</i>

20:52.719 --> 20:55.486
Hello? Fleet detectives.
We're never too busy.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.689
I can't give up. I've
thought about it all night.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.592
I've got to see her,
is that too much to ask?

21:01.594 --> 21:04.629
Just a minute, judge.
Her wiretap just came on.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.864
<i>-What's happening?
-Her agent is calling her.</i>

21:06.866 --> 21:08.799
<i>Hello? I've got an
audition for you.</i>

21:08.801 --> 21:10.568
<i>-When? What time?
-Tomorrow.</i>

21:10.570 --> 21:12.737
<i>-Can you make it at 11:00?
-Yeah, sure. I can make that.</i>

21:12.739 --> 21:15.573
<i>-What's the, what's the part?
-It's a leading role.</i>

21:15.575 --> 21:17.541
It's a lead?
No kidding.

21:17.543 --> 21:20.645
Yeah, I'm thrilled.
What's the character?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.313
<i>She's a hooker?</i>

21:22.315 --> 21:23.748
<i>-A hooker?
-Yeah.</i>

21:23.750 --> 21:25.716
No kidding.
That's kind of funny.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.618
What... What's
like the director?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.520
<i>Arnold Albertson.</i>

21:29.522 --> 21:31.656
Arnold Albertson?

21:31.657 --> 21:33.791
<i>-Yeah. He's very good.
-Never heard of him.</i>

21:33.793 --> 21:35.632
<i>-He's one of the best.
-Okay.</i>

21:35.633 --> 21:38.596
<i>-Bye.
-All right, bye.</i>

21:38.598 --> 21:40.665
<i>Okay, judge, don't worry.
I'll follow her.</i>

21:40.667 --> 21:42.633
I feel better now that you're
still on the case.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.914
-Hi, Derek.
-Hi.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.083
Remember me? Elizabeth!

21:59.085 --> 22:00.851
Elizabeth, right.
We...

22:01.821 --> 22:03.754
Squirrels To The Nuts?

22:03.756 --> 22:06.324
My God, yes!

22:07.026 --> 22:08.559
Yes, Chicago.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.960
No, Dallas.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.596
Dallas, that's right.
Yes. Yes.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.864
How have you been?

22:13.866 --> 22:16.000
How have I been?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.969
-You absolutely changed my entire life!
-Have I?

22:18.971 --> 22:21.472
I can't believe I'm running
into you right now.

22:21.474 --> 22:25.509
I started a dress line with that money.
I just got back from Paris.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.412
I'm going to Rio to start a deal!
How have I been?

22:28.414 --> 22:30.014
Well, it's great to
see you, I'm just...

22:30.016 --> 22:31.916
Derek, how do I find you?

22:31.918 --> 22:35.519
I feel like I've been asking myself
the same question the last 40 years.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.088
And I still don't
know, but listen,

22:37.090 --> 22:40.091
I'm just rushing off,
but we'll always have Dallas

22:40.093 --> 22:42.026
and I'm so happy
I was able to help.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.661
Okay, well, thank you again.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.563
-And I hope I see you again.
-I know.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.082
Okay. Okay...

22:48.083 --> 22:50.600
<i>So there were others. He
helped me and he helped them.</i>

22:50.603 --> 22:52.636
<i>And I'm not saying
what he did was right.</i>

22:52.638 --> 22:53.904
<i>I'm not defending him.</i>

22:53.906 --> 22:56.140
<i>But he did it for the high,</i>

22:56.141 --> 22:58.375
<i>and after every high there
always comes the crash.</i>

22:58.378 --> 22:59.610
Arnold!

23:03.750 --> 23:05.616
How was the flight?

23:08.554 --> 23:11.889
One of my clients gave me a
lifetime of therapy as a gift.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.691
And my therapist was a drunk.

23:13.693 --> 23:17.728
So she left to dry out.
Her daughter took over, Dr. Jane.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.766
And she wrote this book

23:21.768 --> 23:23.934
<i>finding your softer side.
Do you know it?</i>

23:23.936 --> 23:26.003
-No.
-Big best-seller.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.607
<i>She seemed like a sweet woman
and I was excited to talk to her.</i>

23:33.179 --> 23:35.613
<i>Yes, yes. My mother has
been gone for three months.</i>

23:35.615 --> 23:36.947
If you would like
to talk to me, fine.

23:36.949 --> 23:38.716
If you would not like to
talk to me, that's fine.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.451
-Have you decided?
-No.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.186
No. I mean,
I'd like to talk to you.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.555
She'd been through a rough
break up the year before

23:44.557 --> 23:45.923
with a hot yoga teacher.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.792
Well, I mean, the yoga
was hot, not the teacher.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.928
Well, actually, the teacher was,
too, but that's not the point.

23:50.930 --> 23:57.201
They meet in class, and he starts
to give her these private lessons.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.637
And then they move in together.
It turns out

23:59.639 --> 24:02.907
he had been giving every other woman
in the class private lessons, too.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.876
Can you imagine?

24:05.878 --> 24:09.980
<i>I mean, no wonder her latest book
is called Bitchy Is Beautiful.</i>

24:09.982 --> 24:11.816
That one I read.
Yeah.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.685
-All right, have a seat.
-Yeah, thanks.

24:14.687 --> 24:18.122
So, I've taken a look at your file.
What's your name again?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.690
Izzy.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.525
That's short for something.
What's your full name?

24:21.527 --> 24:22.693
I beg your pardon?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.628
What's your full name?
Pay attention!

24:24.630 --> 24:25.729
My name is Isabella.

24:25.731 --> 24:28.098
There.
Isabella.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.134
And you've cut it down to Izzy.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.169
That means you are cutting
off the sweet part of yourself

24:32.171 --> 24:36.240
because Isabella is so
sweet and Izzy is so hard.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.709
There's some insight into
your personality right there.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.711
It seems that you're insecure
with your sweet self,

24:40.713 --> 24:43.247
so you're emphasizing
your tough self.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.816
Am I right or am I wrong?
Where's your file?

24:47.553 --> 24:49.053
Okay...

24:49.055 --> 24:52.823
A.K.A. Glo stick...
Why A.K.A. Anyway? Do...

24:52.825 --> 24:54.925
Call girl?

24:56.562 --> 24:59.096
Well, that's disgusting.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.265
I mean, how do you feel when
you're even doing that?

25:02.034 --> 25:03.601
Honestly.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.836
Are there any up
sides to this job?

25:05.838 --> 25:10.508
Well, there were a lot of ups...
That wasn't really the problem.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.777
You don't joke in therapy.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.547
I'm just... I'm feeling
kind of nervous.

25:16.549 --> 25:19.149
You know, I've got this really
important audition tomorrow.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.785
What? So you're auditioning
to be a call girl?

25:21.787 --> 25:23.984
No, no, no.
I do that on the side,

25:23.985 --> 25:26.557
like, just to kind of
support my acting.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.226
So you have an audition.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.095
-What's the role?
-A call girl.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.563
Wait, I just asked you that.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.765
I know, it's so ironic,

25:34.767 --> 25:37.701
but life is like that sometimes.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.838
All right, well that's great.
At least you have a lot of experience.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.543
Shit!

25:45.545 --> 25:47.244
<i>-Hold on a second.
-Hello? Hi!</i>

25:47.246 --> 25:48.979
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

25:48.981 --> 25:50.915
<i>I guess you're
probably in a session.</i>

25:50.917 --> 25:52.850
Great, it's my mother.
She's drunk!

25:55.855 --> 25:57.221
Does he bite?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.256
I don't know. It depends.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.791
Yeah, 'cause...

26:02.028 --> 26:04.562
What are you doing?
Excuse me!

26:04.564 --> 26:05.896
Please get off the chair.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.898
-Are you insane?
-I don't really like dogs.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.770
Don't like dogs.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.772
Come on. Come on.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.740
Go on, scram! Scram.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.975
Come on.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.847
God, you're neurotic,
that's for sure.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.618
My mother's calling from a
Detox Center outside of Pisa.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.590
<i>Hello, I really need
to speak to somebody</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:34.358
<i>about my obsessional problem.
Maybe I could make an appointment.</i>

26:34.360 --> 26:37.628
<i>I'm on the Verge here...
The very Verge.</i>

26:37.630 --> 26:39.730
That voice sounds so familiar...

26:39.732 --> 26:43.767
Yeah, well, it's starting to
sound way too familiar to me.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.036
That guy is a total loon!

26:48.674 --> 26:50.140
But I cannot talk
about my clients.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.976
I cannot talk about
my clients...

26:51.978 --> 26:54.244
Because that's private.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.146
So I can't tell you who it is,
so don't ask me.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.149
Now, where was I?

26:59.151 --> 27:03.854
So if you would just embrace
the softer side of yourself,

27:03.856 --> 27:06.090
and stop living
on that hard edge,

27:06.092 --> 27:08.058
you would be in
such better shape.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.960
Just start calling
yourself Isabella

27:09.962 --> 27:14.031
and you may solve many,
if not all, of your problems.

27:14.033 --> 27:17.067
Well, today I've stopped
being a call girl.

27:20.373 --> 27:21.905
That's great!

27:21.907 --> 27:24.108
That's great!
You see how therapy works!

27:24.110 --> 27:26.910
It's like a... It's
like a swiss clock.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.346
That's fabulous. You don't need
therapy any more. We're finished.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.949
Just get yourself a large dog...
They're great company.

27:31.951 --> 27:35.052
Congratulations,
Izzy... Isabella.

27:35.054 --> 27:37.755
You've graduated.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.024
Well, your name is the first
thing people learn about you.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.393
You know, it's how they think
of you. It's who you are.

27:42.395 --> 27:45.029
Dr. Jane gave me that, but...

27:45.031 --> 27:49.333
I wasn't going to be Izzy Finklestein
from Brooklyn any more.

27:49.335 --> 27:53.170
I was going to be
Isabella Patterson.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.838
From wherever I wanted to be.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.155
What a thrill to
see you walk in!

28:11.157 --> 28:13.457
-Delta, you know Josh?
-Of course.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.393
Your play's only
gotten better, Joshua.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.228
Thank you! I can't
wait to see you do it.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.064
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.799
And you know Seth, of course.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.934
Do we know each other?
How long's it been since London?

28:23.936 --> 28:25.235
Too long, dear.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.371
Come here.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.972
Nice to meet you.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.908
Let's get everybody going.
Sandy!

28:32.945 --> 28:35.446
-You're looking gorgeous.
-Seth, you're such a charmer.

28:35.448 --> 28:37.114
Well, I hope so.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.882
Did you know Seth Gilbert was
going to be at the audition?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.751
No. No idea.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.153
I didn't even know he did theater
any more, since those movies.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.023
What's the one where he had
like pink, fluffy sleeves

28:46.025 --> 28:47.725
and the trained Bumble Bee
in his belt buckle?

28:47.727 --> 28:49.426
<i>-Red Bee man?
-Yeah...</i>

28:49.428 --> 28:52.930
Well, after all five of those
I sort of stopped following him.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.032
What about Delta Simmons?

28:55.034 --> 28:57.234
You want, you want to hear
something really funny?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.002
Sure.

28:59.004 --> 29:02.372
One time, she comes into the
salon and my ma washes her hair.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.809
So we got this picture of ma and
Delta above the fake fireplace.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.444
Talk about cosmic forces...

29:07.446 --> 29:09.813
Now, I had the chance
to work with her.

29:09.815 --> 29:12.750
<i>It was fate, but I
never got to tell her.</i>

29:18.157 --> 29:20.190
"Let me just ask
you one question.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.861
"Do you promise that
whenever I ask the...

29:23.863 --> 29:25.496
"Whenever I tell you something

29:25.498 --> 29:28.932
"that you'll always stand by
me and that you'll never be...

29:31.070 --> 29:34.805
"That you'll always be my
friend, and that you'll always...

29:34.807 --> 29:36.473
Do you promise that no
matter what I tell you..."

29:36.475 --> 29:39.042
Producer's daughters...

29:39.044 --> 29:41.545
"Do you promise that no matter
what, you'll always be my friend..."

29:41.547 --> 29:43.781
Great, thank you.
That was excellent.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.984
I think you're a little bit young,
but thanks so much for coming in.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.286
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

29:49.288 --> 29:50.988
Very good, darlings.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.923
Okay, Sandy, next!

29:52.925 --> 29:54.825
This is Isabella Patterson.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.300
Goodness!

30:04.136 --> 30:05.803
Hey, hey, hey!

30:05.805 --> 30:07.371
There we are.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.274
-Sorry. I'm so nervous.
-Don't be nervous. Just relax.

30:10.276 --> 30:13.143
Jesus, no! God damn it!

30:13.145 --> 30:14.511
She's not right.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.014
-Why not?
-Because she's not the right type.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.950
-Josh...
-I think she looks great for it.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.589
Just relax.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.027
Are you okay, Isabella?

30:30.029 --> 30:31.361
If you're not feeling well...

30:31.363 --> 30:33.197
Sandy, why don't we
get her information

30:33.199 --> 30:35.432
and come back another time when
you're feeling more up for it.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.234
She's sick, unfortunately.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.203
No, no, I'd rather do it today

30:39.205 --> 30:41.071
because I looked at
astrology zone today

30:41.073 --> 30:44.308
and it said it was going
to be a special day for me.

30:44.310 --> 30:47.511
Okay, well, we don't
want to argue with that.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.912
Let's proceed.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.147
Maybe we'll get surprised.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.349
So, I've prepared three scenes.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.018
We're only going to do one because
we're under a lot of pressure.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.954
Okay...

30:56.956 --> 31:00.123
So which one should I do?

31:00.125 --> 31:03.060
Arnold, don't you think we should
do the intimate scene with me?

31:03.062 --> 31:08.232
No, no. We're going to do
the scene with the two women.

31:08.234 --> 31:11.568
You look familiar. Were
you at the barclay recently?

31:11.570 --> 31:12.970
No.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.905
Seth, you're not in this scene.

31:14.907 --> 31:19.209
So, why don't you take a breather
and we'll let the ladies begin.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.411
I'm sorry.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.888
Are you okay, dear?
Do you need a second?

31:30.890 --> 31:32.256
-No.
-Sure?

31:32.258 --> 31:33.657
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.599
"You sure you
don't want a drink?"

31:42.601 --> 31:46.503
"No, no. I just don't
know where to start."

31:46.505 --> 31:48.538
"Well, start anywhere you like."

31:50.576 --> 31:54.111
"I just don't know how
it all happened, but...

31:54.113 --> 31:56.647
"It was sort of a
very grecian evening.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.918
"You see,

32:00.920 --> 32:05.355
"I got into this line of
work where you usually...

32:05.357 --> 32:07.557
"You don't know who
you're going to end up with

32:07.559 --> 32:09.291
"until you get to
your destination.

32:09.292 --> 32:12.262
Sort of like a temp,
but more intimate."

32:12.264 --> 32:13.363
"What are you talking about?"

32:16.135 --> 32:19.136
"Well, this is really difficult.

32:19.138 --> 32:23.974
"Because you are my very close
friend and I do tell you everything

32:23.976 --> 32:25.442
"and that's why
I'm telling you this.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.210
"Otherwise if I didn't care
for you, I wouldn't tell you.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.112
"And I could go on forever
being your best friend

32:29.114 --> 32:32.349
"and you really wouldn't have to
know, but I really need to tell you."

32:32.351 --> 32:34.451
-"What are you talking about?"
-"Well...

32:36.121 --> 32:38.322
"I was a call girl

32:40.225 --> 32:42.693
"and I pretty much
am a call girl."

32:44.229 --> 32:45.996
"A call girl!"

32:45.998 --> 32:47.731
"Let me just ask
you one question.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.534
"No matter what I say,

32:50.536 --> 32:54.204
"Please don't judge me

32:54.206 --> 32:57.040
"And whatever I tell you, promise
me you'll always be my friend

32:57.042 --> 32:58.675
"and you'll always stand by me."

32:58.677 --> 33:01.144
"Of course.
Anything.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.213
"I care about you.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.016
"But I'm also very,
very shocked.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.618
"And I also feel so sad.
Those rotten bastards!"

33:08.620 --> 33:10.354
"Put it this way.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.255
"Do you want the bad news?

33:12.257 --> 33:14.091
"Or the bad, bad news?

33:14.093 --> 33:16.226
"Or do you want the bad,
bad, bad news?"

33:16.228 --> 33:18.028
"My God, there's more?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.198
"Okay, give me the bad news."

33:22.034 --> 33:23.467
"The condom broke."

33:23.469 --> 33:25.736
-"No..."
-"Yeah.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.739
"And the bad, bad news
is that I'm pregnant."

33:28.741 --> 33:30.741
-"God!"
-"Yeah..."

33:30.743 --> 33:34.044
"Well, I guess I'll be an auntie...
That's not so bad."

33:34.747 --> 33:36.246
"Well...

33:36.248 --> 33:38.448
"The bad, bad, bad news?"

33:39.585 --> 33:40.650
"Yes?"

33:42.087 --> 33:44.521
"Gosh..."

33:45.758 --> 33:47.057
"What?
Tell me."

33:48.060 --> 33:50.360
"It was your Fred.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.230
"Please don't hate me.
And don't hate him.

33:53.232 --> 33:56.566
"It was just one of those crazy,
stupid, weird things

33:56.568 --> 33:58.101
"that happen to you in life

33:58.103 --> 34:01.405
"and you can't predict
it and you can't judge it!

34:01.407 --> 34:04.474
"So please...
Please don't hate me."

34:07.413 --> 34:10.746
That was brilliant, darling.
That was so good!

34:10.748 --> 34:13.382
Darling.
Wasn't she so good, Arnold?

34:14.152 --> 34:15.318
Very good.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.621
Very good.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.456
Thank you so much for coming,
we're running late, so...

34:20.458 --> 34:22.391
I'll show her out, Sandy.
You bring in the next girl.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.561
-Very good, Isabelle.
-Thanks a lot.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.797
-Yeah. Bye.
-Goodbye!

34:27.800 --> 34:29.433
Hey, I'll walk you out.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.534
Well done.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.837
Wasn't she good?

34:33.839 --> 34:36.273
She was. Very.
She nailed it!

34:36.275 --> 34:37.607
Wasn't she good, Arnold?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.510
I did think she was good.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.148
She really moved me.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.118
Okay, so what's next?
Let's move on...

34:56.829 --> 34:59.596
-So, you were a call girl?
-In the play.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.598
No, that's not what
you've been implying.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.266
Yeah, no.
Izzy was. Yeah.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.635
But you're Izzy.

35:07.406 --> 35:08.738
I am.

35:10.676 --> 35:14.111
So, are you by any chance
free for dinner tonight?

35:14.113 --> 35:16.513
I don't know. Yeah, I guess.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.714
Good. Good.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.784
I was so impressed
with that reading today.

35:20.786 --> 35:25.622
But, to be honest, I was impressed
before the reading too, so...

35:27.159 --> 35:29.192
Well, thanks a lot.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.393
Yeah.

35:30.395 --> 35:32.863
Do you know
Arnold Albertson that well?

35:32.865 --> 35:34.664
Yeah, I know him.
But not very well.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.534
He's helped me with the
play for a year. Why?

35:37.536 --> 35:41.905
Nothing. He just seemed
like a really nice guy.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.473
Yeah...
Do you like italian?

35:44.810 --> 35:46.910
Food.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.546
Yeah, sure.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.815
How about Nicks on Fifth?

35:51.817 --> 35:53.416
Or should I pick you up at home?

35:53.418 --> 35:56.353
No, no, no. I'll meet
you at the restaurant.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.388
-What time?
-Eight o'clock?

35:58.390 --> 36:01.625
Okay, sure. I'll see you then.

36:01.627 --> 36:05.829
Okay. Don't tell anybody,
but I'm rooting for you.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.665
Thanks a lot.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.268
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.402
Bye.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.907
<i>Do you know the movie
breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

36:16.909 --> 36:19.593
<i>-Yes.
-Well...</i>

36:19.594 --> 36:22.278
<i>They were playing it somewhere
downtown and I see this poster</i>

36:22.281 --> 36:24.214
of Audrey looking so gorgeous.

36:24.216 --> 36:26.183
So I bought a
ticket and I went in.

36:26.185 --> 36:30.187
And, for weeks I couldn't get this
movie out of my head, you know?

36:30.189 --> 36:32.455
She had everything
under control.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.324
Everything figured out,
she didn't need anything...

36:34.326 --> 36:36.259
She is a call girl.

36:36.261 --> 36:42.432
Well, maybe she was just somebody
who liked to have a drink and a dance

36:42.434 --> 36:44.301
and spread happiness,

36:44.303 --> 36:46.469
and if a guy was going to give her
50 on the way to the powder room

36:46.471 --> 36:50.340
then she deserved it because
she touched their lives.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.342
I'm perfectly aware
that it's an obsession.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.711
But maybe if I knew more
about the woman herself...

36:54.713 --> 36:56.246
Yes, what is it about this woman

36:56.248 --> 36:58.515
that makes her so
goddamn obsessionable?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.350
She doesn't sound
like my grandmother.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.519
Say, what?

37:02.521 --> 37:04.688
Every woman I've ever known
sounds like my grandmother,

37:04.690 --> 37:06.623
except for this one.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.757
Glo...

37:07.759 --> 37:08.758
Glo?

37:09.995 --> 37:11.695
As in Glo stick?

37:11.697 --> 37:13.697
Why, yes.
Why?

37:13.699 --> 37:15.966
My God.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.534
What do you mean, "My God?"

37:17.536 --> 37:20.303
I mean... My God!
That's terrific!

37:20.305 --> 37:22.639
What a terrific...
Terrific name.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.874
Yeah, you don't come
across that name too often.

37:24.876 --> 37:29.512
No, but in therapy you do.
It's kinda common in therapy.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.281
You know a Glo stick?

37:31.283 --> 37:34.517
Yes, I do. Okay?
In fact, I am her therapist.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.254
But professional reasons make
it impossible for me to discuss

37:37.256 --> 37:39.356
anything whatsoever
to do with her.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.957
She's a very nice
woman, however.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.326
She's a little neurotic and
she has got quite a few problems

37:43.328 --> 37:44.928
and she needs to get in
touch with her softer side.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.498
But that's... That's private!
That is private! I am a doctor.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.435
Doctors do not discuss their
patients' private lives.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.638
How would you like it if I
my next client walked in here

37:54.640 --> 37:56.506
and I said that the guy
that just walked out of here

37:56.508 --> 38:00.377
Is a lunatic weirdo obsessed
with a woman named Glo stick?

38:00.379 --> 38:01.645
How would you like that?

38:01.647 --> 38:03.546
Well...

38:03.548 --> 38:06.983
And by the way, I don't think
that this girl, however attractive,

38:06.985 --> 38:08.752
is worth being obsessed about.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.688
Especially for a married
judge of other humans.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.591
Now, I'm not judgmental,
but that's just stupid!

38:15.861 --> 38:17.427
<i>It's me, Josh.
Can you pick up?</i>

38:17.429 --> 38:18.728
See what a good therapist I am?

38:18.730 --> 38:20.730
That's my boyfriend
and I'm not picking up.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.883
This is your private time.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.035
<i>So, I'm kind of stuck with the play
tonight and I can't make it for dinner.</i>

38:27.906 --> 38:31.007
What do you mean? What do you
mean you can't make it to dinner?

38:31.009 --> 38:33.310
Fine! You know what?
I'll starve.

38:33.312 --> 38:35.512
I've starved before,
I'll starve again.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.714
You know, I've been
starving a lot myself lately.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.482
Perhaps we should
starve together.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.084
Would you care to have
dinner with me tonight?

38:41.086 --> 38:42.686
What kind of food do you eat?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.087
Do you like italian?

38:44.089 --> 38:45.922
It's all right.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.691
-So?
-All right.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.826
I'm going to change my tampon.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.796
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't agree with you.

38:52.798 --> 38:56.599
I just think that Patterson
girl "nailed it," as Seth put it.

38:56.601 --> 38:59.569
I just think that there was something
about her that nobody else had.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.672
Kind of an experienced quality.
Almost like she'd lived it.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.075
Yeah, I have to say,
I agree with Delta and Seth.

39:05.077 --> 39:08.011
I mean, she had something really,
really special.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.947
She reminds me of the girl that 
I fell in love with in kindergarten.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.115
Was she a hooker?

39:12.117 --> 39:14.050
Yeah, she was a
kindergarten hooker.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.419
That sounds like a
progressive school.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.421
Okay, Sandy, who have
we not discussed?

39:19.391 --> 39:20.824
You've covered it.

39:20.826 --> 39:24.394
Okay, well, why don't we call
it a night and sleep on it.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.596
That Izzy, though,

39:26.598 --> 39:29.399
I feel like I know
her from somewhere.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.935
Well, she did have one of
those sort of ordinary faces

39:31.937 --> 39:33.503
that are a dime a dozen, so...

39:33.505 --> 39:35.572
I don't think so.

39:35.574 --> 39:38.541
Well, what do I know? I'm so hungry
I can't even think straight right now.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.410
Okay, looks like that's a wrap.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.611
Okay.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.548
You're looking more
beautiful than ever.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.450
I can't wait to do this...
Especially the love scenes.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.651
Get out of here.

39:48.653 --> 39:49.986
Well, thank you, Mr. Director,

39:49.988 --> 39:53.022
that was a very surprising
first day, wasn't it?

39:53.024 --> 39:55.959
It sure was, yeah. That's why we go
to the theater... To be surprised.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.794
Incidentally, you might
find a few more colors

39:57.796 --> 40:00.096
in your performance
tomorrow in rehearsals.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.098
But good job today.
We're just beginning.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.033
Hey, sorry if I was a
little snappy, darling.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.736
But, why don't I make it up
with a little romantic dinner?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.054
Can I help you, sir?

40:25.056 --> 40:26.756
Table for one, over there.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.092
This way, please.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.595
Hi!

40:36.568 --> 40:37.667
Hi.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.135
I'm so sorry I'm late.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.740
My God, are you all right?

40:43.742 --> 40:45.008
It's all right, it's all right.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.209
No, no... Let me get you up.

40:49.181 --> 40:50.747
May I offer you some water?

40:50.749 --> 40:52.549
-No.
-Scotch and soda?

40:52.551 --> 40:54.484
-Maybe.
-I'll look into it.

40:57.889 --> 40:58.888
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.125
Such a beautiful restaurant.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.630
Ahem!

41:14.072 --> 41:15.872
-What's your problem?
-Nothing, nothing...

41:15.874 --> 41:18.541
I'm just... I was thirsty.

41:24.883 --> 41:25.982
Thank you.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.689
What is it with you?

41:32.691 --> 41:34.657
I don't know what's the matter
with me. I'm just very thirsty.

41:34.659 --> 41:38.127
Well, then pick up the glass!
Stop pushing it off the table.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.130
You must have been
such a demanding child.

41:41.132 --> 41:44.501
God, I'm just starving.

41:44.503 --> 41:48.638
Anyway, as I was saying,
I'm just so sick of artists.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.206
They just always let you down.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.575
Just give me a
great businessman.

41:52.577 --> 41:54.544
Dating this playwright...
They write plays,

41:54.546 --> 41:57.013
they don't think
about life, they...

41:57.015 --> 41:59.082
Are you listening to
anything that I'm saying?

41:59.084 --> 42:00.817
And why are you hiding
behind that menu?

42:00.819 --> 42:02.619
I'm not!

42:02.621 --> 42:06.956
Lawyers, good people. Yes. Yes.

42:06.958 --> 42:09.659
I just have to change my life,
that's all I can say. I have to.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.130
What are you looking at?

42:18.103 --> 42:19.669
Is that who I think it is?

42:22.240 --> 42:23.973
That son of a bitch!

42:25.944 --> 42:28.811
My gosh!
Are you all right?

42:28.813 --> 42:32.549
-Yeah, yeah.
-Everybody keeps falling down!

42:32.551 --> 42:35.118
Wow, how great!
Here's my therapist...

42:35.120 --> 42:37.220
Jane, look, you have to...

42:38.590 --> 42:39.923
You're fired!

42:42.928 --> 42:44.661
Josh!

42:44.663 --> 42:45.962
Are you okay?

42:45.964 --> 42:47.697
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
-You sure?

42:47.699 --> 42:49.299
-Yeah.
-Do you know her?

42:49.301 --> 42:50.667
Yeah, I guess I do.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.770
Don't just leave!

42:53.772 --> 42:56.005
You're fired, too!

42:56.007 --> 42:58.041
Watch where you're going!

42:59.978 --> 43:01.110
You...

43:04.683 --> 43:07.850
I have got to go
to the ladies room.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.892
-Are you all right, son?
-Dad!

43:15.894 --> 43:17.794
-What are you doing here?
-I work here.

43:17.796 --> 43:19.862
-From when?
-It's a long story,

43:19.864 --> 43:21.197
and neither of us
has time for it.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.169
I'll see you in a minute.

43:28.173 --> 43:29.906
I'm going to use the rest room.

43:33.311 --> 43:35.044
Jane! Wait!

43:47.392 --> 43:50.960
Well, hello, wonderful reading!

43:50.962 --> 43:55.231
I was just getting some air.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.833
Of course.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.403
Josh, what are you doing here?

44:00.405 --> 44:02.405
Arnold.
Hi.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.173
Delta always said
this was a great place

44:04.175 --> 44:05.875
-so I thought I'd try it.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:05.877 --> 44:08.277
I'm here with that girl, Izzy.
I was so impressed with her.

44:08.279 --> 44:10.913
-She's here?
-Yeah. In the ladies room.

44:11.883 --> 44:13.850
Dear God in heaven.

44:13.852 --> 44:14.917
What?

44:14.919 --> 44:18.955
Why would you...

44:18.957 --> 44:21.090
-Judge, let's take a little walk.
-I don't want a little walk.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.226
I'm going back in there
and see what's going on!

44:23.228 --> 44:25.828
Not right now, judge.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.664
Well, I can't follow
anything you say.

44:27.666 --> 44:28.765
Let's not blow it now.

44:28.767 --> 44:31.067
Look who I found
in the ladies room.

44:31.069 --> 44:32.301
-Josh...
-Yeah.

44:32.303 --> 44:34.370
Josh told me.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.172
-How are you?
-I'm fine, thanks.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.408
-Fast moves, Josh.
-No, I just...

44:38.410 --> 44:40.977
Have you had a chance to
look at the menu yet, Arnold?

44:40.979 --> 44:42.879
Luckily, our kids love
their grandparents,

44:42.881 --> 44:45.682
but we really should try to tuck
them in tonight, right, darling?

44:45.684 --> 44:48.184
You know, I don't feel too good.
I think I'm gonna go.

44:48.186 --> 44:50.386
-No.
-I'm sorry.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.155
-Feel better.
-Yeah.

44:52.157 --> 44:53.356
Feel better.

44:53.358 --> 44:56.793
Well, look whose here.
One minute, Dmitri.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.695
Hey, Glo! What do ya know?

45:00.298 --> 45:03.199
You talking to me?
No, I'm Isabella.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.734
You two know each other?

45:04.736 --> 45:05.835
No. Not really.

45:06.771 --> 45:08.471
Yeah, my mistake.

45:08.473 --> 45:11.841
The gang's all here.
Of all the gin joints...

45:11.843 --> 45:14.911
Delta, you look even younger now
than you did that time in Piccadilly

45:14.913 --> 45:16.946
when you played with
those children. Remember?

45:16.948 --> 45:19.348
That was fun, wasn't it?

45:19.350 --> 45:22.752
It was really nice to see
you all, but I gotta go.

45:22.754 --> 45:24.454
-Feel better.
-Yes.

45:24.456 --> 45:26.756
-See you tomorrow.
-Let's sit down, Frankie.

45:28.727 --> 45:30.460
Arnold,

45:30.462 --> 45:32.729
Frankie is friends with Vickie.

45:32.731 --> 45:33.963
I don't know any Vickies.

45:33.965 --> 45:35.998
My mistake.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.734
-Must be some other guy.
-Yeah.

45:37.736 --> 45:40.837
Everybody seems to be confused
tonight! Must be the weather.

45:40.839 --> 45:41.904
Yeah.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.072
Confusion reigns.

45:44.809 --> 45:46.209
See you in the morning.

45:46.211 --> 45:48.044
Good night, sweet princess.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.313
<i>Adieu.</i>

45:50.315 --> 45:52.448
Good night.

45:52.450 --> 45:53.816
<i>Adieu.</i>

45:55.754 --> 45:57.019
Why don't you like that girl?

45:57.021 --> 45:59.856
-Which girl?
-Isabella Patterson.

45:59.858 --> 46:01.057
Who said I don't like her?

46:01.059 --> 46:03.326
Well, you certainly
act weird around her.

46:03.328 --> 46:05.828
Act weird? I barely
even looked at her.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.797
Exactly.

46:07.799 --> 46:11.467
It's better, it's better than
swooning over Mr. Seth Seduction.

46:11.469 --> 46:14.370
I mean, everything he says you act like
it's the funniest thing you ever heard.

46:14.372 --> 46:16.839
Pish-Tosh... You're
always jealous.

46:16.841 --> 46:20.076
Why is everything always
back to London and Piccadilly?

46:20.078 --> 46:22.512
And this glorious
time you guys had.

46:22.514 --> 46:24.981
We had a good time on
that play, you know that.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.783
No, I know. I'm sorry.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.791
There they are!

46:34.793 --> 46:36.159
-Judge...
-What?

46:36.161 --> 46:38.928
I'm sorry to tell you,
but a problem has come up...

46:38.930 --> 46:40.196
That's my son.

46:41.032 --> 46:43.065
That's your son?

46:43.067 --> 46:46.169
There's something not kosher here.
How long has this been going on?

46:46.171 --> 46:50.139
What are you talking about? I didn't
know anything until half an hour ago,

46:50.141 --> 46:51.541
if that's what you're implying.

46:51.543 --> 46:53.042
I smell a rat.

46:53.044 --> 46:55.278
Ha, you do? So do I!

46:55.280 --> 46:57.513
-Wait, wait, wait!
-I'm tired of being abused.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.150
I hope you're
feeling better now.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.586
Yeah, I'm okay.

47:03.588 --> 47:05.588
But you, you didn't
get anything to eat.

47:05.590 --> 47:08.925
You want to come in
and have a sandwich?

47:08.927 --> 47:10.927
-Sure.
-Okay.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.230
God damn wrestling match!

47:14.232 --> 47:15.565
Would you stop complaining?

47:15.567 --> 47:17.433
Shut up!
I can't hear the TV.

47:17.435 --> 47:20.203
You shut up!
Go play on the highway!

47:20.205 --> 47:21.370
What's normal?

47:21.372 --> 47:23.506
He was the first playwright
that I ever met.

47:23.508 --> 47:25.208
And he was a true gentleman,
you know?

47:25.210 --> 47:29.011
He didn't even try to kiss me,
even when I knew he wanted to.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.314
And, he asked to meet my father.

47:31.316 --> 47:33.349
And no one had ever
done that before.

47:33.351 --> 47:36.419
I never even had a boy
in the house before.

47:36.421 --> 47:40.923
But... Yeah, he was exactly what
I imagined a playwright to be.

47:40.925 --> 47:45.394
Very sensitive and, he was like
the Arthur Miller to my Marilyn.

47:47.532 --> 47:50.867
That was a great sandwich.
Thanks.

47:50.869 --> 47:53.469
Are you okay?
You seem a little sad.

47:54.472 --> 47:56.939
Yeah, it's just...

47:56.941 --> 48:00.877
I don't think I'm
gonna get the part.

48:00.879 --> 48:03.279
I feel very optimistic about it.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.215
You're very sweet.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.519
May I call you?

48:13.024 --> 48:14.423
Yeah.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.392
Sure. Why not?

48:16.394 --> 48:18.995
Well, thanks for making
my play better.

48:21.499 --> 48:23.366
So long, Josh.

48:42.287 --> 48:44.921
That Loretta girl
gave a fair reading...

48:44.923 --> 48:46.522
Isabella gave a brilliant one.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.424
You have to make
a decision today.

48:48.426 --> 48:48.842
Yeah.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.092
I don't understand
what the problem is.

48:50.094 --> 48:53.062
It's not a problem. No one
said anything about a problem.

48:53.064 --> 48:55.331
-It's just that I have a process, okay?
-A process?

48:55.333 --> 48:57.133
And the process
begins with a bagel.

48:57.135 --> 49:00.636
-Pull the rigger, darling.
-I'm eating in silence, honey.

49:00.638 --> 49:02.004
-Come on.
-Arnold!

49:02.006 --> 49:04.540
We're going to go to
61st and Madison.

49:06.210 --> 49:07.410
Lovely day, isn't it?

49:10.615 --> 49:12.214
Well, he's a talker, isn't he?

49:12.216 --> 49:13.683
They gave me the wrong bagels...

49:13.685 --> 49:15.318
I asked for poppy seed.
They gave me four...

49:15.320 --> 49:16.686
Boy, are you in a mood today!

49:16.688 --> 49:17.987
Which nobody eats.

49:17.989 --> 49:20.056
Tell me why you don't like her?

49:20.058 --> 49:23.292
Who said that I don't like her? I just
don't want to make a snap decision.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.294
-A snap decision.
-It's too important. It's my process.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.530
Who is the one who always says
you have to go with your gut

49:27.532 --> 49:29.532
and not think about
things too much?

49:29.534 --> 49:31.334
-All right, not me.
-That was a direct quote...

49:31.335 --> 49:32.234
I don't talk like that.

49:32.236 --> 49:35.604
-I never... Talk about my gut.
-What is wrong with you?

49:35.606 --> 49:37.506
There's nothing wrong with me.
I am under a great deal of pressure

49:37.508 --> 49:40.543
and I don't need my wife
adding more pressure.

49:40.545 --> 49:42.678
You have to admit,
there is something about this girl.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.513
Maybe she was a
escort in a past life.

49:44.515 --> 49:47.316
-Now we're talking about past lives?
-I don't know.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.485
What's going on?
Where's the driver?

49:50.555 --> 49:52.088
Is that him?

49:52.090 --> 49:55.024
Yeah, that's him.
But where's he going?

49:55.026 --> 49:57.360
He seems to be
getting into a cab.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.228
This is the craziest thing
I've ever seen. What...

49:59.230 --> 50:01.564
Was it something we said?

50:01.566 --> 50:04.100
Apparently...

50:04.102 --> 50:06.602
Either that or it's a mob hit
and we're about to blow up.

50:06.604 --> 50:09.372
Yeah, well, get out. Get out.

50:09.374 --> 50:13.275
What is this, like a
existential cab driver.

50:13.277 --> 50:16.178
I think he couldn't take
the tension between us.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.214
I know, maybe that
was his process.

50:18.216 --> 50:20.116
Okay, I'll give her
the goddamn part!

50:20.118 --> 50:21.751
That's all it took?

50:21.753 --> 50:24.420
-Yeah.
-She owes that cabbie ten percent.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.325
Hello?

50:29.327 --> 50:30.393
Sandy?

50:32.230 --> 50:33.662
You're not kidding, are you?

50:35.433 --> 50:37.166
Tomorrow.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.501
10:00 A.M.

50:38.503 --> 50:41.437
Okay! Thank you so much!

50:42.373 --> 50:44.140
Okay, bye now.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.109
-I got the part!
-What part?

50:47.111 --> 50:49.111
-Broadway!
-Broadway?

50:49.113 --> 50:50.713
So that's how you got the part?

50:50.715 --> 50:52.114
That's what he told me, yeah.

50:52.116 --> 50:53.816
-And you believed him?
-Yeah!

50:53.818 --> 50:55.651
I think... It's kind of funny,

50:55.653 --> 50:58.120
but I really don't see how you
can make a story like that up.

50:58.122 --> 51:00.523
The same way you make up a
name or cheat on your wife.

51:00.525 --> 51:02.758
He lied to you!

51:02.760 --> 51:04.460
I don't know if I agree
with you, actually.

51:04.462 --> 51:07.496
Because Arnold and I met under
very specific circumstances.

51:07.498 --> 51:10.099
And he didn't owe me anything.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.767
Especially not the truth.

51:11.769 --> 51:14.503
And he certainly didn't
have to give me that part.

51:14.505 --> 51:15.638
And he probably shouldn't have,

51:15.640 --> 51:17.139
for all the grief
that it caused him.

51:31.789 --> 51:34.123
Now, don't yell...
Let me explain.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.324
Nope!

51:35.326 --> 51:36.492
No. No.

51:36.494 --> 51:37.726
No. Get out!

51:37.728 --> 51:39.462
-I was...
-No!

51:39.464 --> 51:42.131
You are one of the most
horrible people I've ever met...

51:42.133 --> 51:46.268
No, in fact, you know what, you are the
most horrible person I have ever met.

51:46.270 --> 51:50.506
You cancel our dinner to go out
with one of my sick patients.

51:50.508 --> 51:53.709
Do you know that only
tells me how sick you are!

51:53.711 --> 51:55.511
God, I just want to
shove this up your cock!

51:55.513 --> 51:58.714
Jane, for God's sake,
it all has to do with my play.

51:58.716 --> 52:00.483
Your play?

52:00.485 --> 52:03.419
I don't care about your play!

52:03.421 --> 52:05.721
Your stupid little play,
I don't care about you.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.223
Just get out!

52:07.225 --> 52:08.491
No.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.793
-Hello?
-How dare you answer your cellphone

52:10.795 --> 52:12.361
in my office!

52:12.363 --> 52:14.797
That's great! I'm
so happy for you.

52:14.799 --> 52:16.632
And now you're happy.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.535
Now he's happy. You're always
depressed with me. Why is that?

52:19.537 --> 52:20.836
Why is that? Who is that?

52:20.838 --> 52:23.172
I can't talk right now.
Call me later.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.141
Was that the crazy blond?

52:25.143 --> 52:26.375
Or the needy father?

52:26.377 --> 52:28.210
Jane, I must talk to you!

52:28.212 --> 52:31.313
God, you know what? I'm so sick
of both of you. Just get out!

52:32.183 --> 52:33.349
All of you, get out!

52:33.351 --> 52:35.451
Just get out!

52:35.453 --> 52:36.819
Okay.

52:36.821 --> 52:37.887
Out!

52:41.292 --> 52:43.492
I'm sick of these tight clothes.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.494
I've gotta get a loose-fitting
suit or something.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.196
Either that or it's liposuction.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.598
Come on, you look great.
You're fishing for compliments.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.734
-Stop it!
-Harpooning is more like it.

52:51.736 --> 52:54.570
Hey, you two strangers,
what are you doing here?

52:54.572 --> 52:56.939
Well, I know what
you're doing here.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.574
Promotion, promotion.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.342
-Promoting.
-Hi.

53:00.344 --> 53:01.944
This is Cece, my P.R. Lady.

53:01.946 --> 53:04.513
Miss Simmons, would you consider
doing a commercial for us?

53:04.515 --> 53:06.916
And of course you can
direct it, Mr. Simmons.

53:06.918 --> 53:08.617
It's Albertson.
Thank you.

53:08.619 --> 53:10.619
Well, I guess I blew
that one. I guess you did.

53:10.621 --> 53:12.421
Thank you, but I don't
really do commercials.

53:12.957 --> 53:14.690
Not my thing.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.725
Did you want to find
some large clothes?

53:16.727 --> 53:18.494
I said less tight...

53:18.496 --> 53:20.529
Yeah, but no, the relaxed or the
more looser fitting are over here.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.630
Nice to meet you.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.532
We'll see you, Seth.

53:24.569 --> 53:25.668
See you later, guys.

53:25.670 --> 53:27.236
My God.

53:27.238 --> 53:29.471
-What's the rush?
-This stuff doesn't look good,

53:29.473 --> 53:31.640
and it's too expensive.
Let's go some place nice.

53:31.642 --> 53:33.576
Like, like Chanel or Prada.

53:33.578 --> 53:35.377
That's bargain basement.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.414
I feel like I'm claustrophobic,
I can hardly breathe in here...

53:38.416 --> 53:40.649
-Look! I love tweed.
-Freaking me out...

53:40.651 --> 53:43.485
I'm going to try this on.

53:43.487 --> 53:45.788
Okay, here, come on, I'll help you.
I love tweed, too.

53:45.790 --> 53:47.356
Arnold, I don't need your help.

53:47.358 --> 53:48.924
Are you sure?
Here, let me watch.

53:48.926 --> 53:51.527
At home, maybe you can
watch me take it off.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.864
Take it easy, cowboy.

53:55.866 --> 53:58.000
I know, but I'm a
good judge of you in tweed.

53:58.002 --> 53:59.568
I know, but sometimes
it's like...

54:10.014 --> 54:11.680
Squirrels to the nuts!

54:11.682 --> 54:13.282
Are you okay?

54:14.485 --> 54:16.819
I cannot believe I'm
running into you, Derek!

54:16.821 --> 54:18.687
No, I'm not going to be quiet.

54:18.689 --> 54:20.623
It's Margie,
remember? From Chicago!

54:20.625 --> 54:22.524
I've looked everywhere for you.

54:22.526 --> 54:24.960
You don't understand,
you've changed my life.

54:24.962 --> 54:27.930
I went to fashion school and
I'm the executive buyer here...

54:27.932 --> 54:29.531
-Besides that...
-Shut up...

54:29.533 --> 54:31.267
You gave me the single best night
I've ever had!

54:31.269 --> 54:32.768
In bed and out.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.371
And it's all because of you
and the Squirrels To The Nuts!

54:35.373 --> 54:36.872
Please keep your voice down!

54:36.874 --> 54:38.574
Okay, see you later, guys.

54:38.576 --> 54:39.942
My God, Seth Gilbert!

54:39.944 --> 54:41.410
So, you guys friends, Arnold?

54:41.412 --> 54:42.911
Where are you going
with this, Seth?

54:42.913 --> 54:44.713
Now you two behave
yourselves, okay?

54:44.715 --> 54:46.348
Is there anything else you need?

54:47.551 --> 54:49.485
"Squirrels To The Nuts,"

54:49.487 --> 54:52.288
you weasily,
no good son of a bitch!

54:52.290 --> 54:54.790
Don't you ever,
ever speak to me again!

54:54.792 --> 54:56.558
Delta, no!
Delta...

55:00.031 --> 55:01.597
Seth, wait!

55:08.339 --> 55:10.306
I got the license plate!
Easy to trace.

55:10.308 --> 55:12.841
No, no, don't worry. I'll take
care of it. I'll pay for everything.

55:12.843 --> 55:14.943
She's my wife,
she was just in a hurry.

55:14.945 --> 55:17.546
Yes, she's a little late for a meeting
and she's a little scattered-brained.

55:17.548 --> 55:19.315
Just absent-minded.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.050
Brad, it's okay. I know him.
He's good for it. Believe me.

55:21.052 --> 55:22.384
Okay, okay.

55:22.386 --> 55:23.786
Tell your wife to be
more careful, Bub.

55:23.788 --> 55:25.621
I will... More careful.

55:25.623 --> 55:27.923
Look, Derek... Arnold...
Whatever your name is.

55:27.925 --> 55:31.560
I know I was speaking too loud.
I was just so excited to see you.

55:31.562 --> 55:35.497
-It's okay...
-Cash, check or charge?

55:35.499 --> 55:37.333
So what is that girl,
a hooker?

55:37.335 --> 55:38.767
Like the one you came
to Nick's with?

55:38.769 --> 55:40.035
Could be.

55:40.037 --> 55:41.970
Call girl.
Escort.

55:41.972 --> 55:45.341
What's the difference? They all
escort you in and out of their pants.

55:45.343 --> 55:46.809
Men!

55:46.811 --> 55:49.545
Yeah, you're right.
We're only good for one thing.

55:50.614 --> 55:52.381
So how about some?

55:52.383 --> 55:54.783
-I'm considering it!
-I still remember London, Delta.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.752
I haven't felt that way since.

55:56.754 --> 55:58.654
Come on, Seth.

55:58.656 --> 56:01.824
You know we were both too far down
other roads for us to get serious.

56:01.826 --> 56:04.360
You were. I would've switched
direction in a second.

56:04.362 --> 56:05.928
I know. You've switched
a bunch of since then.

56:05.930 --> 56:08.063
-It was different with you.
-Come on...

56:08.065 --> 56:09.798
I'm still ready, del.

56:10.735 --> 56:12.034
This is it, Mr. Gilbert.

56:12.036 --> 56:13.802
-What are you promoting this time?
-My new cologne.

56:13.804 --> 56:15.371
Don't tell me what it's called.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.772
They came up with a
pretty good name, actually.

56:16.774 --> 56:17.940
"Seth's Seduction."

56:17.942 --> 56:19.575
Great...

56:21.612 --> 56:23.879
Mr. Gilbert, it is so wonderful
to have you here!

56:23.881 --> 56:25.814
Everybody's been dying
to meet you in the flesh.

56:25.816 --> 56:27.516
-I beg your pardon?
-He's teasing you.

56:30.454 --> 56:32.621
-Delta, keep up! Keep up!
-I'm trying.

56:34.725 --> 56:35.958
Excuse me.

56:37.061 --> 56:38.894
Can we have your autograph?

56:38.896 --> 56:42.464
We waited four hours in line,
it'll only take you a second.

56:42.466 --> 56:45.801
I'm trying to get to you.
I'm behind here.

56:47.405 --> 56:48.737
Okay, lady, the jig's up.

56:48.739 --> 56:53.075
What are you...
Wait! Seth! Seth!

56:53.077 --> 56:56.412
Well, she ain't a pro.
What, you came back for more?

56:56.414 --> 56:57.813
The suit wasn't enough?

56:57.815 --> 56:59.648
No, I didn't steal
this from here.

56:59.650 --> 57:01.950
-Where did you steal it from?
-No, I didn't steal it at all.

57:01.952 --> 57:04.019
I got into an argument
with my husband at Barney's

57:04.021 --> 57:05.921
and I walked out by accident.
You should call them.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.023
His name is Arnold Albertson,
I'm sure he's paid for it by now.

57:08.025 --> 57:09.691
Could you please put me down?

57:09.693 --> 57:11.193
All right, lady, I'll put
you down. You're an idiot.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.762
We hear a lot of stories,
but this one tops them all.

57:13.764 --> 57:16.098
"I had an argument with
my husband at Barney's

57:16.100 --> 57:18.600
so I came over to Macy's
to steal another suit."

57:18.602 --> 57:20.536
No, you don't understand.
I didn't steal this at all!

57:21.772 --> 57:23.105
Yes. Hello?

57:23.107 --> 57:25.174
What? Who?

57:25.176 --> 57:27.776
The police? What are
you talking about?

57:27.778 --> 57:31.647
What, are you crazy? Yes,
put her on the phone, please!

57:31.649 --> 57:34.016
Arnold? You better get me
the hell out of here

57:34.018 --> 57:35.584
and over to my
parents' apartment!

57:35.586 --> 57:37.219
And I better get there
within the next 20 minutes!

57:37.221 --> 57:39.021
And you better make damn sure
that you're out of the apartment

57:39.023 --> 57:40.823
before I get there!

57:40.825 --> 57:42.991
And what I suggest you do is
get yourself a hotel room, buddy,

57:42.993 --> 57:44.726
and order another call girl!

57:44.728 --> 57:46.795
Squirrels to the fucking nuts!

57:58.976 --> 58:02.811
The unicorn, you see, was
a kind of symbol of women.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.881
And this comes from a period when
women were treated like Chattel.

58:05.883 --> 58:07.483
Like Cattle?

58:07.485 --> 58:08.917
No, Chattel.

58:08.919 --> 58:12.020
It basically means they were
whatever men wanted them to be.

58:12.022 --> 58:14.256
You mean, like now a lot?

58:14.258 --> 58:16.058
Yeah, I guess.

58:16.060 --> 58:18.627
Part of that's why
I wrote the play.

58:18.629 --> 58:23.532
You know, in really ancient times,
the prostitute was a sacred profession.

58:23.534 --> 58:25.067
When was this?

58:25.069 --> 58:29.271
Well, before spirituality and
sexuality were split apart.

58:29.273 --> 58:30.906
They really shouldn't be.

58:30.908 --> 58:31.974
Yeah.

58:33.611 --> 58:36.545
You're a real romantic
guy, aren't you?

58:36.547 --> 58:39.681
I guess Josh saw
something in me.

58:39.683 --> 58:41.850
And it wasn't really
like Arnold.

58:41.852 --> 58:44.253
You know, with Arnold, the money
was as much for him as it was for me.

58:44.255 --> 58:51.293
But with Josh, I think he was the
first person who ever believed in me.

58:51.295 --> 58:53.862
<i>So, of course, cue
somebody from my past</i>

58:53.864 --> 58:56.798
<i>who's going to show up and
ruin the whole damn picture.</i>

58:56.800 --> 58:58.800
Why are you breaking my heart?

58:58.802 --> 59:00.836
Don't you understand
you're breaking my heart,

59:00.838 --> 59:03.705
Izzy... Glo...
Whatever your name is.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.674
-Judges have feelings, too.
-Mister!

59:05.676 --> 59:08.777
I don't think we're in exactly the
best place to have this conversation.

59:08.779 --> 59:11.880
So I suggest you turn around and
go right back where you came from.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.549
And I suggest that
you shut your trap!

59:13.551 --> 59:15.083
I am talking to the lady...

59:15.085 --> 59:17.753
The lady of the night over
here who broke my heart.

59:17.755 --> 59:20.088
I call Vickie's escort
service and the next day...

59:24.061 --> 59:25.561
-Josh, what are you doing?
-Dad?

59:25.563 --> 59:26.728
He's an old man.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.630
-Yeah, a dirty old man!
-That is irrelevant.

59:28.632 --> 59:31.233
Okay, okay.
Dirty sometimes, but not old!

59:31.235 --> 59:35.003
For God's sake, Joshua, do you realize
what you're getting yourself into?

59:35.005 --> 59:37.706
This lady had a night
with your director!

59:37.708 --> 59:39.641
A perfectly romantic one,
I should say.

59:42.146 --> 59:43.879
Isabella! Wait!

59:45.149 --> 59:46.782
Isabella!

59:48.986 --> 59:51.954
It must have been really hard for
you, Josh finding out like that.

59:54.825 --> 59:57.225
<i>Double team him now, he's got
three seconds to get out of...</i>

59:57.227 --> 59:59.895
Where ya been honey? The phone's
been ringing off the hook for you!

59:59.897 --> 01:00:02.130
All day long!
That's too many calls!

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:05.233
-That Joshua... Sandy and Alfred...
-Again.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.902
What now?

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.203
A Derek.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:11.807
Hello?

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.775
Izzy, it's Arnold. I need
to see you right away.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.778
Can you come over to the
barclay, same room. 1369.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.748
<i>I'll explain everything.
Just meet me here.</i>

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.216
I don't know if I can do that.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.185
What do you mean you don't
know if you can do that?

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:27.789
We gotta rehearse!
Just, just, just get over here.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.324
<i>Now, they're all
five in the ring...</i>

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.926
Okay.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:34.229
Hello, Vickie, this is Dr. Do...

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.031
Yeah. Yeah, tonight.

01:00:36.033 --> 01:00:38.133
The barclay. 8:00 P.M.
Under the usual name.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.702
<i>You remember that
girl, Glo stick?</i>

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:41.903
<i>Anyone like that?</i>

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.406
Right this way, sir.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.774
Thank you, son.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.385
-Hello?
-Seth O'Malley?

01:00:56.387 --> 01:00:57.819
I'm just confirming
she's on her way.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.221
She'll be there in half an hour.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:00.956
Great, thanks. I'm
in a different room.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.424
<i>Yeah, I know.
You told me...</i>

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:04.059
Hang on a minute.
I want a description.

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:05.093
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:07.763
-Yes?
-Seth?

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:09.031
How about now?

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:11.733
<i>-Delta?
-No, the Queen of Sheba.</i>

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:15.737
Okay, hang on, Sheba. I'm just on
the other line. Long distance, okay?

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:18.407
<i>-Vickie?
-She's tall and blond and...</i>

01:01:18.409 --> 01:01:20.409
Stop her! I can't
see her right now.

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.377
Stop her? I can't stop
her. She's in transit.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.179
<i>-Has she got a cellphone?
-Yeah.</i>

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.715
Well, call her and tell her to
go on to her next appointment.

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:28.316
I'll call you later maybe.

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.285
Well I'll try, but her cellphone
hasn't been working so well.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.987
Okay, call her and
then call me back.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.055
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.957
-Hey.
-Yes?

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.426
<i>Well, come on over.</i>

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.428
Where are you, at your
parents'? I'm in 1328.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.296
<i>-Yes, I'll be right there.
-See you soon.</i>

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:11.326
Sorry...

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:13.028
It's okay.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:34.750
Did you not get the call?

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.418
You call me.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.254
No. Vickie. She called to tell you
to go to your next appointment.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.489
I'm busy now.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:43.125
Busy? Okay.

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:45.026
It's okay, I will wait for here.

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:48.196
No, no, no, no.
Another lady is coming now.

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:49.364
-Yes.
-Yes?

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.099
-Who I happen to love.
-Yes.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.901
Do you understand?

01:02:54.138 --> 01:02:57.939
My English is not so fast.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.207
God.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.010
Vickie, she tell me come here.

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:05.514
Room
1-3-2-8.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:06.982
-Yes?
-Yeah.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.450
You don't understand.

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:11.186
I call Vickie.

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.055
-Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no...
-Yes.

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:16.224
Wait, don't do that.
You need to go.

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:18.293
Yes. It's ringing.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.561
Jesus Christ...

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:35.010
It's all very confusing.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:38.079
And it's... Confusing.

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.815
Very.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.285
-You know, Josh knows about us now.
-He does?

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:46.488
So does Seth.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.591
Yeah, well... I figured that.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:52.928
All that's left is Delta...

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.143
You mean I should
stay in the play?

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:10.412
Are you kidding?
Of course. Why not?

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:11.913
We're professionals.

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:17.219
No, Kandi, you have to go
back down to the lobby now

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.854
and make your call there, okay?

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:22.123
No, Vickie, she tell me,
"hang on".

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.525
I hang.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.293
Shit!

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:26.995
-Who is it?
-It's me, Sethy.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.430
-Delta!
-Yes.

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:31.366
Just a second! Pants!

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.034
Bathroom! Get in the bathroom!

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.636
I call Vickie.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.571
You get in there now.

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:41.476
Okay...

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:48.416
How many women do you think he's
done this with? Why does he do this?

01:04:48.418 --> 01:04:51.152
What is it all about? Do you
have any idea what's going on?

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:53.255
What is this whole "changed my life"
business? What is the...

01:04:53.257 --> 01:04:56.658
What are you talking about?

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.960
I thought you wanted
to talk about us.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:02.397
Go back by the Serpentine
and Hyde Park and...

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:04.065
Just hold me for a moment,
will you?

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.201
Come here.

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:09.437
I still got it for you, Del.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:12.540
Darling,

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.209
let me use your bathroom.

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:16.411
My what?

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.481
Your bathroom...
My bathroom!

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:21.650
Well, the, the,
the toilet's broken.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.084
I need to call them again.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:24.319
I don't need to use your toilet.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:26.988
You don't need to use my toilet.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.657
No, I don't need
to use your toilet.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:32.327
Well, then I guess if you
don't need to use the toilet...

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.995
Please, stop saying toilet!

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.498
You are weird.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:51.980
<i>Hello, Kandi?
Kandi?</i>

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:54.983
<i>Kandi, is that you? I put
you on hold, are you there?</i>

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:08.029
Delta... Delta, darling,
listen, it's not what you think.

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:13.134
Delta!

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.420
Delta! Delta!

01:06:15.421 --> 01:06:17.705
<i>1329, it should be right
next door to where you are.</i>

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:20.108
Okay, thanks Vickie.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.077
Delta, it was a
misunderstanding.

01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:23.411
She wasn't supposed
to come to my room.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.547
Come on, Seth. You can
do better than that.

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:28.516
Why would I have you come over
with her? It doesn't make any sense!

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:31.386
The girl needed to use the bathroom...
She got scared. I don't know!

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:33.188
Lady, it's my fault.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.423
I supposed
to go 1-3-2-9.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:38.693
Wrong room.
Thanks for bathtub, mister.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.000
-You see? I told you.
-I still don't believe you.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.235
You love your hookers, too.
Just like my husband.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:50.105
No, it's because I can't
have you. He has you.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:52.173
Nobody has me.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.441
Good night.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:05.020
Yes. Arnold Albertson's
room, please?

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:10.658
Hello?

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.561
Who? Arnold?
Yes, this is me.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.497
Who is this?

01:07:15.499 --> 01:07:17.465
Delta! No, no...

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:21.403
Delta, darling. Where,
where, where are you?

01:07:21.405 --> 01:07:25.073
Downstairs?
What are you doing here?

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:28.710
I thought... No, no, no. Yes,
I'm happy to hear from you.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:31.246
You know, the last time I spoke
to you you were in jail, and...

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:32.614
Yes, come right up.

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:35.617
My God...

01:07:35.619 --> 01:07:37.252
Why'd you tell her
to come up here?

01:07:37.254 --> 01:07:39.220
We're in a code red, do you
understand what that means?

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.222
We have a tornado
coming up the elevator

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.158
and it's about to
touch down here.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.126
Now you've got to go.
We're gonna put you...

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.764
Jesus, that's the fastest
elevator I've ever seen!

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:51.766
Bathroom!

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:54.569
-I think I'm gonna throw up.
-Do it quietly.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:00.059
Hi, honey.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.709
Arnold, how long have
you been doing this?

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:03.845
-Doing what?
-Doing what you've been doing.

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.081
Obviously, you've
done it more than once.

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:07.449
This whole "Squirrels
To The Nuts" thing

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:10.385
is obviously your own
special little bit.

01:08:10.387 --> 01:08:12.420
I thought it was
just ours, Arnold.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.723
Something you said to help me get
through a difficult time in my career.

01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:18.259
Evidently you've been using
it as some kind of seduction,

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:22.162
a kind of lure, a kind of a general
serenade for whoever wants to listen.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.131
Delta, darling,
it's more complicated...

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:26.367
Than meets the eye, yes, I'm sure.
Well please, tell me. What is it?

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.236
Research for some wonderful
new play you're planning?

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:29.703
Some new film, perhaps?

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:32.640
Well, in a way, yes. I'm
touched by women's stories.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.142
Apparently!

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:36.544
No, it's... I'm
sort of a feminist...

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.246
Yeah, sure.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:41.249
That's not the right word,
but kind of a mental aware...

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.319
Odd perfume you're
wearing, Arnold.

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:47.322
Had a little "Squirrels To
The Nuts" up here lately?

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.890
What are you talking
about? No! I...

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.698
I don't believe this.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.435
Twice in a night?

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:02.837
Delta. Delta. Delta,
don't open the door.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:08.776
Delta, it's not
what you think it is.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:11.813
He's right, you know.
It... It's really not.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.249
Okay, you know what?
This is the Topper!

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.152
And now comes my exit.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.821
Out of the room,

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.488
out of the hotel,

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.291
out of this play,

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.228
out of my life!

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.430
Good luck to you both!

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.568
Delta, stop!
Wait!

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.836
Delta! Delta!

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.671
I don't wanna hear
anything more! Ever!

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.740
It's not what it looks like!

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:41.709
Well, it's not exactly first time
I've seen Izzy leave Arnold's room,

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.944
-to be honest, sorry.
-How interesting.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:47.348
It seems that everybody in the
entire world knew what was going on

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.550
except for me.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.318
-Stupid, stupid me.
-You're not stupid.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.687
So glad you boys stick
together in a time of crisis.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.889
Seth, what are you even doing
here? You're always lurking.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.392
Just loitering there, with your
scarves and your little dog.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:58.927
Just stay out of it!

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:00.795
You're the lunatic, chasing
dames with a wife like this.

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:02.530
It seems all men like
chasing dames, Seth.

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:05.400
No, miss Simmons, he was
just trying to help.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.936
You know, he changed my
life. He gave me $30,000

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:11.206
and today I got
my first apartment.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.908
-He what?
-Thirty thousand dollars? U.S.?

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.244
-Yeah.
-I can't handle any more!

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.912
For one night?
You must be good.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:20.415
No, no, no, you
don't understand...

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.516
I was trying...

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:22.850
You happy?

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.453
Where do you get the
right to be so judgmental!

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:28.523
Listen, mate! You don't want to fight
me, I'll kick the shit out of you!

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.391
-Trained on the streets of London!
-Really?

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.660
Is that the same London where you
seduced my wife, seven years ago?

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:34.896
Nothing of the sort at all.
She loved you!

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.464
Not that I can see why or how!

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:38.933
Why? Maybe because I'm
a good guy and I like...

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.768
-Who likes hookers!
-Yeah. Checkmate!

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:43.304
Because I'm not perfect,
okay? Neither are you!

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:45.540
Jesus Christ, this is a waste
of time. It's a waste of time!

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:46.841
I'm going to go to
sleep now, okay?

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:48.810
Tired! Tired!

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:50.745
All I can say is
that in the morning

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:54.349
it's going to be a distinct
pleasure working with you, Arnold.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.585
-Yeah. Your room's over here!
-I knew that!

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.288
<i>There were those
nights when you get home</i>

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.923
<i>and there's no one to call.</i>

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.425
<i>And there's no
vodka left to drink.</i>

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:08.596
And you got nothing on TV apart
from those stupid infomercials.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:13.001
And you're stuck with yourself.

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:16.471
And that's what they mean
when they say the word terror.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:19.040
Because all I wanted was to be
wrapped up in somebody's arms.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.942
Anybody's arms.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:23.811
Even a stranger's.

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:28.750
I hate... I hate being alone.

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:31.919
But when I am,
I look into the mirror

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.555
and I tell myself something
that Audrey Hepburn once said...

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:40.762
"I believe in pink.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:44.699
"I believe that laughter
is the best calorie burner.

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:48.069
"I believe in kissing.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.071
"Kissing a lot.

01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:53.508
"I believe in being strong

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:57.779
"even when everything around
you seems to be going wrong.

01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:03.384
"I believe that happy girls
are the prettiest girls.

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:07.355
"And I believe that tomorrow
is another day.

01:12:08.458 --> 01:12:11.392
And I believe in miracles!"

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.697
I believe in miracles.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:19.400
You know, that...

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:23.705
That works every single time.

01:12:29.112 --> 01:12:31.112
Hey, Isabella.
Thank God.

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:33.781
I was trying to call you all night last
night, you didn't pick up your phone.

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.416
I didn't really know what to do.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:37.485
You know, I figured
I'd just show up.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.420
-Morning Josh. Izzy.
-Hey.

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:41.489
-How did you sleep, darling?
-Not good.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:43.458
Don't let it get ya down!

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.927
Okay, let's start right in. We
don't want to waste any time today.

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:47.095
Is everybody here?

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:48.963
Yeah, everybody but Delta.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.531
Well, then,
everybody's not here!

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:52.066
What do you mean,
"Yeah, everybody but Delta?"

01:12:52.068 --> 01:12:54.769
You mean, "Everybody but Delta",
you leave out the "Yeah."

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:56.504
Everybody's here but Delta, sir.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.106
Okay, don't call me sir, Sandy.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:12:59.774
All right, we're going
to start without her.

01:12:59.776 --> 01:13:01.609
Let's just sit down
and have a table-read.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:03.378
Good morning, everybody!

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:04.779
I assume we're
starting with a reading.

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:06.264
Yes, that's what
I was just saying.

01:13:06.265 --> 01:13:07.748
-I thought maybe we'd just sit down...
-Fine!

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:36.611
Let me just say something
here before we get started.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.713
Look, we're all
professionals here.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:41.649
Which isn't to say that we don't
have problems in our private lives

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:43.751
from time to time.
Of course we do.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:47.855
But what makes us professionals
is that we don't let those problems

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:49.891
slop over into our work.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:55.530
And we can't talk about them
in any way, shape or form.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.665
Use it for your performance,
let it fuel that,

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:01.969
But don't let it distract
you from our purpose here.

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:05.173
Which is, of course, that
old show business cliche,

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:07.108
which I happen to
really believe in.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.510
The show must go on and it will!

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:10.945
-We owe it to the public.
-Fine!

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.213
I agree with you absolutely,

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:14.048
but I'd just as soon
not read the play.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:16.050
I would like to begin
with act 1 scene 1,

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:17.985
between Seth's character and mine.
I'd like to get it up right away.

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:19.987
-Wait, I beg your pardon?
-On its feet.

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.824
Okay...

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.892
Yeah, well, I think that we should
read the entire play first...

01:14:24.894 --> 01:14:26.494
Well, considering the situation,

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:28.463
which of course we're not
going to speak about,

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:30.798
I think we ought to just help
the actors get through this,

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.034
like getting to the end
of a long, dark tunnel,

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:36.137
rather than try to follow some
accepted directorial rules.

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:38.573
I'd like to think you're
bigger than that as a director.

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:43.044
Anybody have a problem
with this? Seth? Izzy?

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:44.145
-Anybody?
-Nope.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.780
-No, not me.
-Great!

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:52.753
Okay we'll start with scene 1.
Only Seth and Delta are needed.

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:55.923
The rest of us can
watch from the orchestra.

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:59.861
Would you bring out the bedroom
with the couch and the two chairs?

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.799
All right, the curtain rises.

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:07.635
It's hal finnegan's hotel suite.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:09.270
Delta, whenever you're ready...

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:12.740
Well, I don't have the first line.
But if I did I would begin.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:15.042
All right.

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.879
"Well, you refuse to understand
what I'm saying, so what can I say?

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.113
I'm sorry, I guess."

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.750
"That's okay, I'm used to it.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.686
You always yell when you don't
know what you're talking about."

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.922
"I know what I'm talking about,
you don't want to hear it.

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:29.957
It's a real female thing."

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.193
"When you don't want to hear
something, you just don't hear it."

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:33.961
"Well, it's very hard
for me to understand

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.731
"how you can sleep with other
women and then sleep with me

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.232
and tell me it doesn't
mean anything."

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:40.067
-"Well, it's true."
-"So you're saying

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.937
"that the time you
spend with other women

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:45.973
"doesn't exist any
more in your brain.

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.142
It isn't some sort
of pleasant memory?"

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:49.977
"No, I didn't say that."

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:52.313
-"Well, then..."
-"Well, then what?"

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.749
"How can I not think about
what you're thinking about

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.084
"when you're making love to me?

01:15:57.086 --> 01:15:59.654
"How do I know you're with me
and not with some other woman

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:01.923
"you made love to
some other time?

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.991
"Therefore we're not in sync?

01:16:03.993 --> 01:16:06.994
Because I might be thinking
about some guy, too, right?"

01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:08.896
"I don't know how we got here.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.232
"All I said was, 'why don't we
go to a vegetarian restaurant.'

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:12.800
"And this had to happen."

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.336
"Give me that."

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.171
-"No, you quit."
-"So did you."

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.106
"Well, just because I'm breaking
my thing, doesn't mean I..."

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:20.942
"What... I can't have a
puff on your cigarette?"

01:16:20.944 --> 01:16:22.944
-"I didn't say that."
-"Well, then, give it to me."

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:24.645
"No, I feel bad now for smoking.

01:16:24.647 --> 01:16:26.647
'Cause it's like I'm
breaking your thing..."

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:29.350
"I have an independent mind. I want
a fucking puff on the cigarette! Now!"

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:31.652
-"Okay, here."
-"Thank you."

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.361
Ring-Ring!
Ring-Ring!

01:16:40.363 --> 01:16:41.996
"Why don't you answer it?

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:43.230
"It's probably one
of your friends.

01:16:43.232 --> 01:16:45.866
"None of my friends
can ever get through."

01:16:45.868 --> 01:16:50.605
"Answer it yourself. I've no interest
in talking to anybody right now."

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:52.640
"I'm getting kinda hungry...

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:53.941
"What do you want to do?"

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.943
"I want you to come
over here and kiss me."

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.785
"Any particular way?"

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.954
"Blindfolded with
my legs crossed."

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.123
"How about blindfolded
with your legs apart?"

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.926
I'm not sure about that line,
Josh. What do you think?

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:13.995
Just read the
fucking script, Seth.

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:15.296
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.031
We'll get to your
dumb actor questions later.

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:19.133
Just read it, Seth.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.902
"How about blindfolded
with your legs apart?"

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:25.373
"Just shut up and kiss me."

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:28.376
"He, he, he leans in and
gives her a long kiss."

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:01.142
Okay...

01:18:04.414 --> 01:18:07.281
All right, okay. I got it!

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.383
Hey, that's it! Cut!

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:12.219
<i>What is this, caligula? I'm
suppose to sit here and watch this?</i>

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:14.288
Sorry, I got really into it.

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.390
Come on, that's it.
We're going to take ten.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:17.925
She's good.

01:18:23.433 --> 01:18:25.800
-Shep! What's going on?
-Heel!

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:27.034
Heel.

01:18:29.305 --> 01:18:31.472
What are you doing
here? Where's Jane?

01:18:34.077 --> 01:18:35.242
What? Wilba!

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.448
-Wilba, come back!
-What the hell is going on here?

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:42.249
I'll tell you
what's going on here.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:46.420
You hired that hooker
because she turns good tricks.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.155
Well, would you like
some good tricks?

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:51.025
'Cause I got a bag full of
them. Who wants to go first?

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:52.460
I've got tricks on all of you!

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:55.229
Jane, this is very
inappropriate and unprofessional!

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:57.898
I don't give a
shit what you think!

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.266
Who do you think
you are, Hemingway?

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:00.968
Miss Jane Claremont,

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.170
you have absolutely no right to
be talking about your patients

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:04.939
in any way, shape or form!

01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.491
And you are?

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.042
Dad! What are you
doing in that outfit?

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:10.978
-My goodness.
-That's your father?

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:14.181
The man who calls you
constantly... Is a rabbi?

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.851
Come on, we're in the middle
of a God damn rehearsal!

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:18.886
-Yeah.
-Well, from what I've just observed,

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.922
I think you might be in the
middle of losing your wife!

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.390
Who is this person?

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:25.126
Who is she, Arnold?

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:26.527
I have no idea!

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:29.230
She's my ex-girlfriend, Arnold.

01:19:29.232 --> 01:19:32.066
I am the person that
knows what's going on here

01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:34.034
and I'm fed up with it.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:37.505
This woman has been hired to sleep
with a number of people in this room.

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:40.007
Two that I know of,
by now probably three?

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:42.109
Really?

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.044
Then I'm going to beat
the shit out of anybody

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.813
who paid to sleep
with my daughter.

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.782
Who was it?

01:19:47.784 --> 01:19:49.016
It was him.

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:51.385
-Him... And him.
-That's a lie!

01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:55.256
<i>A bullet can kill, but a punch
can change things for the living.</i>

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:56.482
<i>I'll give you spoilers.</i>

01:19:56.483 --> 01:19:58.498
<i>John Wayne and
Randolph Scott tore</i>

01:19:58.499 --> 01:20:01.427
<i>apart a bar fighting
for Marlene Dietrich.</i>

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:05.566
<i>John Wayne won, of course,
and they lived happily ever after.</i>

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:08.550
We never did it.

01:20:09.539 --> 01:20:12.373
Stop it, Al, just stop it! What the
hell do you think you're doing?

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:13.974
This is all just a play!

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:16.076
And who... Who is this?

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:18.579
<i>My father tore a
hole in the sky.</i>

01:20:18.581 --> 01:20:20.147
<i>Everyone felt a release.</i>

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.583
Slow down, sir.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:25.419
You can't just come in here and
ruin everything I'm doing, dad.

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:26.887
What is going on?

01:20:39.235 --> 01:20:40.568
Don't come towards me!

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.436
Don't come, I'll blow
this whistle again!

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:49.310
<i>If you don't let go of your
past, it'll strangle your future.</i>

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.362
What is... Give me those!

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.563
Those are not playthings.

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:10.898
No, they're rubbers.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.367
It's not nice to say
rubbers, darling.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.169
-No, they're condoms.
-No, they're rubbers.

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:17.037
Wonderful plays your
father directs...

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.305
No, they're condoms.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.063
I'm going to live my life!

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:44.999
So long!

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:08.355
What? What?

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:10.925
There's our baby!

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:16.530
-Our baby!
-Hey! She's mine.

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:21.335
Bravo! Bravo!

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:28.976
Bravo!

01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:34.114
Bravo!

01:22:36.018 --> 01:22:38.118
<i>So the plays' reviews
were that good?</i>

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.653
<i>I thought it closed in a week?</i>

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.155
Yeah...

01:22:41.157 --> 01:22:43.223
I mean, the problem is,
Long Island house wives,

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:46.627
they don't want to spend their big
night out in the company of call girls.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.963
They want dancing lions.

01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:51.465
They want singing
mormons, you know.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:54.335
They go to the
theater to escape.

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:56.036
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.308
But there was still a sprinkle
of magic waiting for me.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.244
<i>There was this guy in the audience,
sat behind my mother,</i>

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:07.114
<i>and he owned a movie studio.</i>

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:09.216
And the rest is history.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:12.386
Yeah, well, I was really lucky.

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:14.288
Is that what caused you
and Josh to split up?

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.741
Your success?

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.193
<i>Well, you know, I just feel
like some things in life</i>

01:23:19.195 --> 01:23:20.627
<i>aren't meant to last forever.</i>

01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:22.463
Hey, Seth!

01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:24.198
-Hey, Vickie.
-Sorry we're late.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.766
-That's okay.
-Who's that?

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:28.302
Why is she here?
Who are all those women?

01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:30.571
Did you invite them?
Is this an activist group?

01:23:30.573 --> 01:23:33.374
You could say that.

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:35.242
-Dear God, no! Get down!
-What?

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.311
-My feet are killing me.
-My God...

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:39.246
-Squirrels to the nuts!
-No, no, no...

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:40.647
That's the guy I always
talked to you about!

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:42.750
-I thought that was the end.
-It is!

01:23:42.752 --> 01:23:46.186
You have no idea... You have
no idea! You changed my life!

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:49.156
I looked for every Michael Harrington
in the world, practically.

01:23:49.158 --> 01:23:53.260
I took that money and parlayed it into
the best escort service in town, honey.

01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:55.029
How do you like them apples?

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:56.196
Great to see you!

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.531
Bye, I'll catch you later.

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:00.167
That's the end.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:02.469
<i>And Arnold?</i>

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:04.338
Well, I haven't seen him.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:08.108
Last I heard he was working for
some sort of non-profit organization

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.445
making very large, anonymous
donations to women's charities.

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:14.214
And then Delta,
she fell for a new guy.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:17.684
Some sort of rocket scientist. You
know, she's over the moon about that.

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:22.656
And then my therapist... I think
she's still with Seth Gilbert.

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:25.793
<i>You know, the red bees.
So...</i>

01:24:25.795 --> 01:24:28.629
Yeah, it all wrapped
up real nice.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:31.298
You know, sort of
just like a movie.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.435
What about you? Is there
a person in your life?

01:24:34.437 --> 01:24:38.839
Well, let's just say
I got a mentor...

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:42.242
He's actually a lot of the reason
why I'm telling you all this.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:44.144
He's very into saying
it how it is.

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:47.448
He says that this town loves
an actress with a past

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.450
and he's sure right about that.

01:24:49.452 --> 01:24:51.718
Well, it sounds like you've
found your place.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.321
Wherever you are,
that's your happy place.

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:56.690
Squirrels to the
nuts, and all of that.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.292
<i>You're quoting cluny brown now?</i>

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:01.628
What?

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:03.864
<i>That "Squirrels To The Nuts" line,
it's from Lubitsch's Cluny Brown.</i>

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:06.200
-Hey, darling.
-Hey.

01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:08.368
It's what Charles Boyer
says to Jennifer Jones

01:25:08.370 --> 01:25:10.170
just before they fall in love.

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:12.739
You mean to tell me after all
that, it's not even original?

01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:14.575
What's original?

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:16.577
Honey, if we're going to get to
the Sonny Chiba triple feature

01:25:16.579 --> 01:25:18.545
we need to leave right now.

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:20.280
He's a kung-fu actor.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.116
He's the only guy on the planet
who loves movies more than I do.

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:24.751
Yep. True!
But you know a lot.

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.797
That's very interesting,

01:25:36.799 --> 01:25:38.732
you don't seem to be inhibited.

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.534
Try to be more specific,

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:43.203
what made you think that
you were out of place?

01:25:43.205 --> 01:25:44.571
I didn't think I was.

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:46.640
It's Uncle Arn.
He's always telling me,

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:49.276
"Cluny Brown,
you don't know your place."

01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:51.478
Nobody can tell you
where your place is.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.313
Where is my place?
Where is anybody's place?

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:54.715
I'll tell you where it is.

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:57.284
Wherever you're happy,
that's your place.

01:25:57.286 --> 01:26:00.654
And happiness is a matter
of purely personal adjustment

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:02.189
to your environment.

01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:03.624
In Hyde Park, for instance.

01:26:03.626 --> 01:26:06.593
Some people like to feed
nuts to the squirrels.

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:08.862
But if it makes you happy to
feed Squirrels To The Nuts,

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:11.198
who am I to say nuts
to the squirrels?

01:26:30.405 --> 01:26:32.646
What did you do?
Schmuck!

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.233
Thank you, Elliot.

01:26:55.235 --> 01:26:56.935
All you could come up with

01:26:56.937 --> 01:26:59.170
was this weak borscht
about professional ethics

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:02.774
<i>because you are worried about how
this thug will handle rejection.</i>
