12:30.584 --> 12:32.953
And that doesn't even
look like me,

12:32.986 --> 12:35.889
You're right!
That's better,

12:35.922 --> 12:38.291
Chowder, how many have you sold?

12:38.324 --> 12:40.460
Let's see, 1, 2, 3 ‐‐

12:40.493 --> 12:44.965
Can you hold this for a sec?
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,, ,

12:44.998 --> 12:47.267
‐ Are you gonna buy that?
‐ No,

12:47.300 --> 12:49.135
Then none, I've sold none,

12:49.169 --> 12:52.005
Oh, thank heavens! For a
second there, I actually

12:52.038 --> 12:55.842
thought someone bought one of
Chowder's silly newspapers,

12:55.876 --> 12:58.645
[crying] I'm a failure!

12:58.679 --> 13:01.081
Aw, come on!
You're not a failure,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.650
You just didn't succeed,
There's a difference,

13:03.684 --> 13:08.288
But what could be
more interesting than this
awesome crossword puzzle?

13:08.321 --> 13:12.659
Chowder, do you think I'm a
successful chef just because
my food tastes good?

13:12.693 --> 13:14.360
Your food tastes good?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.962
I'm a success because I give

13:15.996 --> 13:18.164
‐ the customer something more,
‐ Indigestion?

13:18.198 --> 13:21.502
I give the customer
an experience,

13:21.535 --> 13:23.537
Yeah, a horrible experience,

13:23.570 --> 13:26.507
‐ 'Cause your food is gross,
‐ Okay! Stop it! Really!

13:26.540 --> 13:31.177
Not another word, About your
yucky cooking, Not one word,

13:31.211 --> 13:34.781
‐ Thank you,
‐ Even though it's yucky,
I'll keep quiet,

13:34.815 --> 13:36.449
Thank you, [clears throat]

13:36.482 --> 13:40.053
as I was saying, I give the
customer an experience,

13:40.086 --> 13:42.989
First, they experience the look,

13:43.023 --> 13:46.359
then the smell, then the taste,

13:46.392 --> 13:48.361
[Truffles] Then the run
to the toilet,

13:48.394 --> 13:50.864
Please, will you stop it?!

13:50.897 --> 13:52.733
[Truffles] Sorry,
Couldn't help myself,

13:52.766 --> 13:53.976
I have feelings, too, you know,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.368
[Truffles] Aww, I know,
Mungy bum,

13:55.401 --> 13:56.870
I'm sorry, I love you,

13:56.903 --> 13:58.471
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I love you, too,

13:58.505 --> 13:59.873
So, my point is, Chowder,

13:59.906 --> 14:01.708
your magazine has to
do the same,

14:01.742 --> 14:04.645
Let me see the cover again,
[laughs] well ‐‐

14:04.678 --> 14:06.046
Aah! There's a problem!

14:06.079 --> 14:09.315
You have to grab them
with a visual experience,

14:09.349 --> 14:10.551
You need a snazzy cover,

14:10.584 --> 14:11.918
But what could be snazzier

14:11.952 --> 14:14.821
than a big block of text?
Hey, I know!

14:14.855 --> 14:18.659
I'll do a cover story on the
most important person
in the kitchen!

14:18.692 --> 14:22.596
‐ The "M, I, P," ‐ Good idea!

14:22.629 --> 14:25.031
The M, I, P, ‐‐ how cute!

14:25.065 --> 14:27.668
‐ Radda!
‐ So, when do you
want to take my picture?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.269
[Truffles] Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:29.302 --> 14:31.404
What, do you just assume
it's gonna be you?

14:31.437 --> 14:34.575
‐ Radda!
‐ I'm the chef,
It's my kitchen,

14:34.608 --> 14:37.410
The place is
named after me, See?

14:37.443 --> 14:40.213
Well, now, we're both
just as important as you,

14:40.246 --> 14:42.248
‐ Radda!
‐ Well, me more than him,

14:42.282 --> 14:45.586
Radda! Radda?
Radda radda radda radda!

14:45.619 --> 14:48.955
Don't oversell yourself, dear,
You're a forklift with eyes,

14:48.989 --> 14:51.858
Well, I say we
let Chowder decide,

14:51.892 --> 14:54.394
Remember, boy, I love you more
than they do,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.197
This is gonna be tough,
Really tough,

14:57.230 --> 15:01.134
Like tough plus more tough times
tough to the power of tough,

15:04.404 --> 15:08.842
Okay, everyone,
Show me why you deserve to be
the M, I, P,

15:11.612 --> 15:16.482
Running this place
takes skill, charm, and you have
to be able to multitask,

15:16.517 --> 15:18.885
‐ [telephone rings]
‐ Hello, darling,
How may we help you?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.922
Here's your change, dear,
Order up!
Please have a seat,

15:21.955 --> 15:25.225
Your order will be ready
shortly,
One at a time, please,

15:25.258 --> 15:29.262
‐ Don't crowd, ‐ [sniffs]

15:32.132 --> 15:35.401
Ah, there you are, Chowder,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.471
I was just about to pull some
fumplings out of the oven,

15:38.505 --> 15:42.442
I know how much you like
fumplings,

15:44.010 --> 15:46.479
Let's see what we've got,

15:49.282 --> 15:53.319
[siren wailing]

15:56.122 --> 16:00.193
Wow, Shnitzel!
You have crazy hose skills!

16:00.226 --> 16:02.863
Radda, Uh, radda radda,

16:05.131 --> 16:06.700
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

16:06.733 --> 16:09.369
[Truffles] I guess he
couldn't stand the heat,

16:09.402 --> 16:11.271
You see, Chowder, without me,

16:11.304 --> 16:13.473
there wouldn't be any water
to put out the fires, ,,

16:13.507 --> 16:15.776
or food to stock the
refrigerators, ,,

16:15.809 --> 16:18.612
because I'm the one paying all
the water bills

16:18.645 --> 16:21.848
‐ and the gas bills and the ‐‐
‐ Gee, I always thought Mung

16:21.882 --> 16:25.285
‐ provided the hot air in here,
‐ I keep this place running,

16:25.318 --> 16:28.188
[Mung Daal] Well, it looks
like someone forgot to pay
the electric bill,

16:28.221 --> 16:33.393
Good thing I made these
glow‐d'oeuvres,
Taste the innovation,

16:33.426 --> 16:37.197
‐ Yes, please!
‐ [munching]

16:37.230 --> 16:40.466
Ra‐dda, Uh, radda, radda?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.637
Of course I used milk
in these glow‐d'oeuvres,

16:43.670 --> 16:47.508
Radda?
[laughs] Uh, radda, radda?

16:50.677 --> 16:53.079
You told me that
milk was still good!

16:53.113 --> 16:58.318
‐ Blaah!
‐ Radda radda! Radda radda,

16:58.351 --> 17:02.756
‐ [singsong voice] Radda radda,
‐ Thanks, Shnitzel,
You're the best,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.091
The best?!

17:05.125 --> 17:06.693
[singsong voice]
Oh, nurse,

17:06.727 --> 17:09.229
When you have a moment, I need
you to deliver this package ‐‐

17:09.262 --> 17:12.733
‐ to the Southwest Pole!
‐ Radda,

17:12.766 --> 17:17.538
And while you're out, I need you
to pick up a few things,

17:21.942 --> 17:24.344
Bye‐bye, now, Toodles!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.079
‐ See ya, ‐ See ya later,

17:26.112 --> 17:27.514
‐ Bye‐bye, now, ‐ Au revoir,

17:27.548 --> 17:29.182
‐ Shabbat shalom, ‐ Goodbye,

17:29.215 --> 17:30.350
[Truffles] Buh‐bye,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.185
Pay attention, now, Chowder,

17:32.218 --> 17:33.787
There's something
I want to show you,

17:33.820 --> 17:36.022
[as Truffles]
Look at me! I'm Truffles!

17:36.056 --> 17:38.559
I like to multitask!
Order up!

17:38.592 --> 17:42.729
How may I help you?
Here's your change!

17:43.930 --> 17:46.199
[as Mung] Take me home!
Ooh, I'm delicious!

17:46.232 --> 17:49.035
Ooh, the ladies love me!
Look at my mustache!

17:49.069 --> 17:50.637
Mung looks shorter than usual,

17:50.671 --> 17:53.540
‐ I'm not paying for this,
‐ It's her fault!

17:53.574 --> 17:56.209
It's his fault! That's not
how I run my register,

17:56.242 --> 17:58.478
I would never
serve myself undercooked,

17:58.512 --> 18:02.382
You people are deranged!
And I am never coming back!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.450
‐ It's her fault!
‐ It's his fault!

18:04.484 --> 18:08.755
How am I supposed to choose
the most important person
in the catering company?

18:08.789 --> 18:12.092
I thought it would be like
choosing a pizza topping!

18:12.125 --> 18:16.563
But it's harder!
Oh, so much harder!

18:16.597 --> 18:22.402
I guess I'll just have a plain
cheese cover for my magazine,

18:22.435 --> 18:24.738
Maybe we should give up on this,

18:24.771 --> 18:27.273
Yeah, you're right,
You should give up!

18:27.307 --> 18:31.344
I'm the most important person
here, and I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows it!

18:31.377 --> 18:33.179
‐ Me, me, me, me, me!
‐ Over my blue body!

18:33.213 --> 18:36.249
Are you ready for a cover shoot?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.918
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am,

18:37.951 --> 18:39.319
I don't know,

18:39.352 --> 18:41.988
I'm beginning to think
this was a bad idea,

18:42.022 --> 18:43.189
Nonsense, Chowder,

18:43.223 --> 18:45.291
With me on the cover,
you can't lose,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.760
Unless you want to be fired!

18:46.793 --> 18:49.362
That cover belongs
to me, right, Chowder?

18:49.395 --> 18:52.265
No way! I've got
a better mustache than you!

18:52.298 --> 18:54.267
‐ Barely!
‐ [creeeeeak]

18:54.300 --> 18:56.436
Uh, guys, that kind of ‐‐

18:56.469 --> 18:57.971
Stay out of this, Chowder!

18:58.004 --> 19:00.306
[groaning]

19:00.340 --> 19:05.111
‐ Let go of him!
‐ You let go!

19:05.145 --> 19:08.882
‐ Ugh!
‐ [groaning]

19:08.915 --> 19:11.885
[groaning]

19:11.918 --> 19:15.589
[groaning]

19:17.591 --> 19:19.826
Ay yai yai yai yai
yai yai yai yai!

19:19.860 --> 19:22.195
Radda ra‐‐ radda?!

19:22.228 --> 19:24.130
[creeeeeeeeeeak]

19:24.164 --> 19:27.901
Radda radda radda!
Raaaah!

19:27.934 --> 19:30.470
Oh, get real, Shnitzel,

19:30.504 --> 19:34.307
[straining] You don't have
what it takes to be M, I, P,

19:34.340 --> 19:38.979
‐ [blam] ‐ [both groaning]

19:39.012 --> 19:40.013
‐ [whap] ‐ [zoom]

19:40.046 --> 19:41.347
‐ Oh, aah!
‐ [zip]

19:41.381 --> 19:43.850
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

19:56.897 --> 19:59.399
[mumbling]

19:59.432 --> 20:04.070
Ra, ,, haaaaaaa, ,,

20:04.104 --> 20:06.840
Oh, whoa, ohhhh,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.510
Ohhhhhhhhhh, no,

20:09.543 --> 20:14.981
My dream is dead, just like the
feeling in my arms,

20:33.066 --> 20:35.201
[Mung Daal snoring]

20:35.235 --> 20:36.637
‐ [door slams] ‐ [all gasp]

20:36.670 --> 20:38.471
‐ I'm up!
‐ [sighs]

20:38.505 --> 20:39.906
We kind of got
carried away, huh?

20:39.940 --> 20:42.876
Yeah, Over a silly little title,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.779
Radda, Radda radda radda radda,

20:45.812 --> 20:48.248
Shnitzel's right,
None of us deserve it,

20:48.281 --> 20:51.217
We put ourselves over the
welfare of the company,

20:51.251 --> 20:54.120
We're monsters, And by that,
I mean we're acting like
monsters,

20:54.154 --> 20:57.257
Technically, Shnitzel's the
monster 'cause he's
a rock monster,

20:57.290 --> 20:59.392
‐ Radda radda,
‐ "Radda radda", yeah,

20:59.425 --> 21:01.394
And Truffles looks
like a monster,

21:01.427 --> 21:03.664
‐ True, ‐ Come on,

21:03.697 --> 21:05.699
Let's get back to work,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.341
That's the M, I, P, Spirit
I was looking for!

21:15.375 --> 21:19.079
The three of you worked together
to clean up the whole kitchen!

21:19.112 --> 21:22.649
And for that, I'm putting all of
you on the cover!

21:24.450 --> 21:26.486
You three have made me proud,

21:26.520 --> 21:30.490
Congratulations, broom, dustpan,
and trash can!

21:34.561 --> 21:36.663
[customers clamoring]

21:36.697 --> 21:38.164
I want that!
Give it to me!

21:38.198 --> 21:39.265
You were right, Mung!

21:39.299 --> 21:40.867
The cover story was a hit!

21:40.901 --> 21:42.468
But I'm afraid our cover boys

21:42.503 --> 21:43.937
have let the fame go
to their heads,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.807
‐ [tires screech] ‐ We quit,

21:46.840 --> 21:49.876
‐ [tires squeal] ‐ [all cough]

21:49.910 --> 21:52.112
Well, I guess we
learned our lesson,

21:52.145 --> 21:54.548
‐ You can keep your cover story,
‐ You said it,

21:54.581 --> 21:58.619
‐ Radda radda radda,
‐ Hey, guys,
Get your suntan lotion out,

21:58.652 --> 22:02.889
'cause the next issue
is the swimsuit edition!

22:02.923 --> 22:06.560
[laughter]

22:07.160 --> 22:08.995
[Mung Daal] Swimsuits,

22:13.099 --> 22:15.135
Mung, Mung, I have some very
disturbing news!

22:15.168 --> 22:17.370
‐ What?!
‐ I was rooting
through your fridge,

22:17.403 --> 22:18.805
and you won't believe
what I found!

22:18.839 --> 22:19.873
Oh, my gosh!
What?

22:19.906 --> 22:21.842
Well, it's more what I
couldn't find,

22:21.875 --> 22:23.710
I couldn't find any snacks
that I like,

22:23.744 --> 22:26.479
I must ask you that you make me
something right away,

22:26.513 --> 22:28.815
Preferably something
with cheese in it,

22:28.849 --> 22:31.652
Or ‐‐ ooh! ‐‐ chocolate‐covered,
I will accept either,

22:31.685 --> 22:32.986
I've got an idea,

22:33.019 --> 22:35.321
How 'bout I make you a big bowl
of whup‐tushy?

22:35.355 --> 22:37.157
Sure, That sounds gre‐‐ aah!

22:37.190 --> 22:39.325
Uh, oh, I get it, I get it,

22:39.359 --> 22:42.629
It's not funny, but I get it,
