Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Thanks for what?

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:35.752
Thanks for what?
Thanks for the help.

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:38.349
It was real nice of you to throw the
money away. Well, you're welcome.

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.917
You're welcome, Mr. Braxton.
You're a fuck-up!

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:44.523
I have asked you not to use that
kind of language to me! Bullshit!

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:46.931
Did you want me to sit there
and watch you get killed?

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:49.027
That's real nice. Fifteen thousand dollars!
He had a gun!

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:51.038
He would have killed you for$15,000!
Killed shit!

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:53.040
That ain't nothin'
but a meatball!

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.702
Do you think I could sit there and let
'em blow your life away for nothing?

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.371
It ain't for nothing! I'm tryin' to help!
It is worth more!

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:02.883
Your life, joe, is worth more
to me than $15,000, you fool!

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:06.409
[Crying]
Here. The money.

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:09.423
Here, take what's left of it!
Here! Take it!

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.925
Take it! There it is! I don't want it!
Vivian--

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:14.052
You can have it! Here, take it!
Listen, Vivian.

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:17.223
Leave me alone! Vivian,
I don't want the money.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:21.395
I don't want the money. [Crying]

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.460
I don't want
the money.

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:25.904
I didn't do it for me.

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:29.569
Goddamn, I didn't--
Vivian.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:32.408

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.414
Vivian.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:42.522
Ain't nobody ever told me
I was worth no $15,000.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:45.889
My daddy used to say, “Boy, you ain't
worth a quarter for two ofya.“

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:53.493
You say that to me...
you set me on fire.

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:59.373
<i>Shit.

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:03.207
What the hell is that?
Where'd you get it from?

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:05.337
I don't know.
It's not mine.

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:08.541
Well, then,

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:14.547
<i>[Schuyler] Good-bye: children.

I hope you feel better.
Good-bye.

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:22.185
You must be Miss Perry
and Mr. Braxton.

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:25.164
Uh, what's wrong?
What are you doing here?

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:30.398
I'm Gladys Schuyler, and this is my
husband Alfred, whom I believe you met.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.703
Yes, but...
what's going on?

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:38.371
Well, these children have told us
about all the wonderful things...

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.846
<i>that you did for them.</i>

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:44.578
Hitchhiking 300 miles in a snowstorm
when your bus broke down.

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:49.021
<i>And sitting up all night for a week with
little Linda when she had the fever.</i>

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:52.753
Helping Harold learn Italian in Braille.
Malta grazie.

<i>[Sti? Ed Laughter] [Gladys]

<i>and they deserve e very chance

[Siren Blaring]

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.872
All right, Braxton,
this is it.

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:18.715
Officer, this man is in violation of
his parole. I'm his parole officer.

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:21.722
I'm taking him, this woman and
these brats back to Philadelphia.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.588
<i>- What's going on here?</i> - <i>You heard me. I'm
taking these people back to Philadelphia.</i>

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:26.388
Do you have a warrant
for my arrest?

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:30.522
Well?
No.

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:34.227
- I'm not going back.
- She's staying.

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:38.238
Who the hell are you? That's Mr.
Schuyler, our town mayor.

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:42.037
All right, now, look, this woman has
violated at least 20 federal statutes.

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:44.305
<i>Number one: kidnapping. [Alfred]
You want a legal battle?</i>

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:47.280
All right, I'm gonna get on the phone.
I'm gonna get a warrant for his arrest,

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:49.441
<i>for her arrest-- [Alfred]
Hold on a minute, friend.</i>

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:52.418
Before you get off the phone, all these
children will be registered in the state.

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:55.786
And I'm having the farm transferred
back to Miss Perry in her name...

01:24:55.857 --> 01:25:00.260
<i>with a big enough loan so she can
operate it properly</i> [Kids <i>Cheering]</i>

I gotta go back. I did something. Don't
worry. Please don't go, we need you!

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.907
We have a reason
for you to stay.

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:23.784
“Dear Mr. Braxton, we,

[Joe]
This is real special.

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:58.585
I just-- I did something
wrong, you know,

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.587
and I made a deal
with the government...

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:03.590
to let me off,
to stay on parole.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:07.924
That's my parole officer,

Shh, don't cry.
