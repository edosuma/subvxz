WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.604
Go.
In the door.

00:03.637 --> 00:04.638
Push!

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Oh, God.
Push.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.608
No no no!
Turn it around.

00:07.641 --> 00:08.609
Turn it around.
You're breaking--

00:08.642 --> 00:09.610
Shove it through!

00:09.643 --> 00:10.811
You shove it.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.147
Shove it back!

00:14.682 --> 00:16.250
Here we go.

00:16.284 --> 00:21.055
Don't break
the branches, Dwight.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.523
Ah, I got a splinter.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.558
Well, suck it up.
We all have problems.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.060
Hey, everybody!

00:26.094 --> 00:28.596
Look what we have!

00:30.198 --> 00:31.699
Nice, huh?

00:31.732 --> 00:33.601
I've got it leveraged.
Push!

00:33.634 --> 00:37.105
One, two, three!

00:37.138 --> 00:38.272
Ah!

00:39.673 --> 00:42.810
Merry Christmas!

01:18.779 --> 01:20.748
Did it work?

01:20.781 --> 01:23.251
Well, sort of.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.653
Why did you
get it so big?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.489
A: that's what she said.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.258
And B: I wanted it
to be impressive.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.159
The biggest day of the year

01:31.192 --> 01:32.226
deserves the
biggest tree of the year.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.729
But what are we gonna do
with this hacked off part?

01:35.763 --> 01:38.799
Well, that is perfectly good
mini tree, Kevin.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.802
And we are going
to sell that to charity.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.771
That's what Christmas
is all about.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.581
So this year,
for the first time ever,

01:53.614 --> 01:56.184
I got Pam
in Secret Santa.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.618
And I got her
this teapot

01:57.651 --> 01:59.753
which I know
she really wants.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.322
So she can make tea
at her desk,

02:01.355 --> 02:03.824
but I'm also gonna stuff it
with some inside jokes.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.595
Like, this is my
high school yearbook photo.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.197
She saw it at the party.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.432
And it really
makes her laugh.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.633
I'm not sure why.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.568
Um, what else?

02:14.602 --> 02:17.638
Ooh, this is
a hot sauce packet.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.608
She put this on a hot dog
a couple years ago

02:20.641 --> 02:23.577
because she thought
it was catsup.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.581
And it was really funny,
so I kept the other two.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.717
This would take a little
too long to explain.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.485
So I won't.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.587
And this is a card.

02:33.621 --> 02:39.760
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.463
Is there anything
we're missing?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.464
Phyllis, you got the lights?

02:43.497 --> 02:47.468
Yes, I got
those cute little ones.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.237
Do you think I should have
gotten the big ones?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.938
We'll see.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.474
Angela drafted me into
the party planning committee.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.509
Her memo said
that we need to

02:55.543 --> 02:59.613
prepare for every
possible disaster.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.384
Which, to me,
seems...excessive.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.686
Merry Christmas!

03:05.719 --> 03:08.356
Ho ho ho!
Pimp!

03:08.389 --> 03:09.823
I'm kidding!

03:09.857 --> 03:10.791
What do we got?
What do we got?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.360
How many plates
are we getting?

03:12.393 --> 03:13.527
50.
Ooh, double it.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.628
Double everything.
Double ice cream.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.564
Double napkins.
Double it.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.299
On me.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.500
It was a tough year.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.001
I had to fire somebody
this year.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.537
This party
has to really rock.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.573
Check it out.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.441
Christmas bonus,
3,000 Gs.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.878
I got this for helping
save the company money.

03:30.911 --> 03:31.912
So I guess some good
came out of

03:31.945 --> 03:34.482
firing Devin after all.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.450
Maybe I should call him,
tell him that.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.586
I want people to cut loose.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.520
I want people...

03:39.553 --> 03:41.289
making out in closets.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.559
I want people
hanging from the ceilings,

03:45.593 --> 03:46.427
lampshades on the heads.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.229
I want it to be
a Playboy Mansion party.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.599
And also,
I want you to know,

03:51.632 --> 03:52.400
and spread the word,

03:52.433 --> 03:53.867
that I will have
my digital camera.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.970
And I will be taking pictures
all the way.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.739
And the best and craziest
thing that happens

03:58.772 --> 04:00.441
will be on the cover
of the newsletter.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.509
Incentive.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.710
You do realize

04:02.743 --> 04:03.844
that we can't serve liquor
at the party.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.480
Yeah, I know.
Dammit.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.416
Stupid corporate
wet blankets.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.583
Like booze
ever killed anybody.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.920
One, two, three.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.358
You guys should use
a hand truck.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.560
Do we have one?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.461
No.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.899
Will you help me?

04:25.933 --> 04:26.900
No!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.036
No way.
It--no.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.037
Come on, Mike,
let me borrow the hat.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.038
For just a couple
of hours.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.072
You wanna be Santa?
Yeah.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.541
Have you ever
seen Santa?

04:33.574 --> 04:36.344
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Who cares?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.478
Well, I'm sorry.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.846
It just doesn't work.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.415
Michael, I would like
to be the elf.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.518
That makes sense,
because he has elfish features.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.488
Okay, everyone,
listen up!

04:47.521 --> 04:50.358
It is time
to get your presents,

04:50.391 --> 04:55.396
wrap them, and place them
under the tree like so.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.732
If you do not
get your present

04:58.766 --> 05:00.434
wrapped and under the tree

05:00.468 --> 05:02.970
within the next
five minutes...

05:03.003 --> 05:05.506
you will be disqualified
from Secret Santa.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.541
All right?
No exceptions.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.576
Except Michael.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.744
I got Angela.

05:10.778 --> 05:14.415
She's into
these posters of babies

05:14.448 --> 05:15.683
dressed as adults.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.351
I got her
one of those.

05:17.385 --> 05:20.588
I felt kind of weird
buying that.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.722
I got Creed.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.823
And to tell you the truth,

05:22.856 --> 05:24.492
I don't know
anything about Creed.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.626
I know his name's Creed.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.461
I know he works
right over there.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.963
I think he's Irish
and I...

05:29.997 --> 05:34.067
I got him this
shamrock keychain.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.405
I got myself
for Secret Santa.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.939
I was supposed
to tell somebody,

05:38.972 --> 05:41.942
but I didn't.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.444
You get something
good this year?

05:43.477 --> 05:46.380
Uh, I think I did
a pretty good job.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.549
Yeah?
Who'd you have?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.451
I can't tell you,
'cause it's a secret.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.119
I think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.454
Yeah?
Spent a lot of dough.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.922
A lot of dough.
Wow.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.124
Well, there's a $20 limit,
right?

05:57.157 --> 05:59.126
Yeah, I wanted this party
to be really special

05:59.159 --> 06:00.894
so I sorta went
above and beyond.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.596
That's great--well,
don't tell me who it is--

06:02.630 --> 06:04.131
It was Ryan!

06:04.164 --> 06:07.034
Yep, I have Ryan.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.636
Gather 'round.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.103
Secret Santa.
Let's go.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.772
Let's go.
Come on.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.707
Stanley--no, I'm gonna
handle the cord, okay?

06:13.741 --> 06:14.908
Safety reasons.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.710
I know how to
plug something in.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.647
I wanna do it.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.181
All right,
let's count it down

06:21.214 --> 06:22.450
like Rockefeller Center.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.084
Ready?

06:24.117 --> 06:27.120
Three, two, one.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.157
Yeah!

06:30.190 --> 06:31.559
Not great.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.528
Sorry, everybody.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.063
I think the tree looks nice.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.432
Hey, I could get some
flares from my car.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.533
No, no.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.568
Shake it off, everybody.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.035
Just--let's do
Secret Santa.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.838
Presents are the best way
to show someone

06:44.872 --> 06:46.173
how much you care.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.141
It is like
this tangible thing

06:48.175 --> 06:49.943
that you can point to
and say,

06:49.977 --> 06:51.679
"Hey, man, I love you...

06:51.712 --> 06:53.146
this many dollars worth."

06:53.180 --> 06:55.415
First present, Oscar.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.455
A shower radio, neat.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.456
Oh, great,
that was from me.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.323
Thanks, Kelly.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.024
You know, I was
gonna get one of these--

07:04.057 --> 07:05.526
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.194
Let's keep it moving on.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.195
Jim.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.229
Oh, cool.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.702
That's from me.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.705
Great.
Where'd you get it?

07:17.738 --> 07:20.073
I don't know,
it was so long ago.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.610
He obviously forgot
to get me something.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.410
And then he went into
his closet

07:23.443 --> 07:25.913
and dug out
this little number.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.481
And then threw it
in a bag.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.617
Yep, that's exactly
what happened.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.785
Pam.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.960
Oh, my God!

07:41.895 --> 07:43.564
Thank you very much, Santa.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.933
Whoever you are.
It's awesome.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.501
There's a little more
to it.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.769
All right, next.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.770
Ryan.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.804
No!

07:56.176 --> 07:57.978
Whoa.
Video ipod.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.814
Ho ho, wow, geez.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.982
Somebody really
got carried away

08:02.015 --> 08:03.250
with the spirit
of Christmas.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.718
It was me.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.286
I got carried away
with the spirit.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.857
Wasn't there a $20 limit
on the gifts?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.592
This is 400 bucks.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.060
You don't know that.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.662
Yeah, you left
the price on.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.564
I did
Oh, shoot.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.565
Wow, okay.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.099
Well, who cares?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.067
It doesn't matter
what I spent.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.836
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right?

08:24.137 --> 08:25.839
Michael.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.275
Oh, hey.
For me?

08:28.308 --> 08:31.044
What is in here?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.948
Oh, come on.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.149
I knitted it for you.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.185
An oven mitt?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.891
So Phyllis
is basically saying,

08:43.924 --> 08:45.058
"Hey, Michael, I know
you did a lot

08:45.092 --> 08:46.193
"to help
the office this year.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.695
"But I only care about you

08:47.728 --> 08:50.163
a homemade oven mitt's
worth."

08:50.197 --> 08:52.766
I gave Ryan an ipod.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.606
Uh, should we just keep
opening up the presents?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.907
We don't do anything

08:59.940 --> 09:01.675
until Michael gives us
further instructions.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.247
I got it!

09:07.280 --> 09:11.284
We are going to turn
Secret Santa

09:11.318 --> 09:13.186
into Yankee Swap!

09:13.220 --> 09:14.955
What is Yankee Swap?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.357
One person chooses a gift.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.160
The next person can either
choose a gift

09:20.193 --> 09:22.996
or steal
that person's gift.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.798
If your gift gets stolen,
then you can

09:24.832 --> 09:27.334
steal someone else's gift
or choose a new gift.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.703
I thought that was called
Nasty Christmas.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.605
Yeah, we call it
White Elephant.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.140
Well, I call it fun!

09:33.173 --> 09:34.107
Why are we doing this?

09:34.141 --> 09:36.376
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.645
It sounds mean.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.779
Shut...

09:38.812 --> 09:40.080
No--it's not.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.114
Okay, just give it a shot.

09:41.148 --> 09:41.915
Michael should have asked

09:41.949 --> 09:44.084
the party planning
committee first.

09:44.117 --> 09:44.918
He's not just supposed
to just

09:44.952 --> 09:47.354
spring things on us
out of nowhere.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.028
Okay, Meredith
is up first.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.664
Here's the deal.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.265
You can either
pick a new gift,

09:58.298 --> 10:00.868
or you can steal
somebody else's gift

10:00.901 --> 10:01.869
they've already gotten.

10:01.902 --> 10:02.870
Like the oven mitt.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.806
I'll take the teapot.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.974
Oh, shouldn't we...

10:07.007 --> 10:08.776
I bought that
specifically for Pam.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.977
Yaaankee Swap.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.079
That's what makes it fun.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.647
Pam, you can steal
the oven mitt now.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.715
I'll take the ipod.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.985
And I have to give it to her?
I don't have a choice?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.352
Yes, now you can steal
the oven mitt,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.088
the old shirt,
or the shower radio.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.023
Or pick a new gift.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.769
That was meant for Kelly.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.771
Yeah, I figured.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.978
I think this is
going great.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.154
Yikes.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.924
Well, it's for Angela, so...

10:59.392 --> 11:00.828
That's like the
creepiest thing

11:00.861 --> 11:02.395
that I've ever seen.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.663
Angela, you're up.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.302
I'll take the poster.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.206
Some people like these.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.142
I will steal
the ipod.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.477
Everyone wants the ipod.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.246
It is a huge hit.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.815
It is almost
a Christmas miracle.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.285
Ah, well, Oscar,
you little gourmand,

11:25.318 --> 11:27.287
you have
the next turn.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.423
I'll take the teapot.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.491
Dammit.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.160
Okay, moving along,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.428
Meredith, let's go.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.463
I really want
the ipod.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.965
A-ca-ca-ca.
It's already been stolen

11:37.998 --> 11:39.366
this round,
pick something else.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.501
I hope nobody
takes this baby,

11:41.534 --> 11:42.970
'cause this is great.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.306
Wow, look at
that fine craftsmanship.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.508
Somebody really put
a lot of work into that.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.843
It's beautiful.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.378
I'll take the oven mitt.

11:51.411 --> 11:55.015
Ssssssssucka!

11:56.784 --> 11:58.085
See, I wanted somebody
to take it.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.053
Boom.
Reverse psychology.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.056
Reverse psychology
is an awesome tool.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.457
I don't know if you guys
know about it.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.360
But, basically,
you make someone think

12:07.394 --> 12:10.297
the opposite
of what you believe.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.901
And that tricks them
into doing something stupid.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.102
Works like a charm.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.410
In addition to these
paint ball pellets,

12:23.443 --> 12:26.346
your gift includes
two paintball lessons

12:26.379 --> 12:27.447
with Dwight Shroot.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.350
You and me, Michael.
Yes!

12:33.286 --> 12:36.023
Who wants to take
paintball lessons?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.290
How is that better
than an ipod?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.960
I never said it was better
than an ipod.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.098
Michael keeps bragging
about his ipod.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.566
But, you know what?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.168
Two paintball lessons
with someone

12:48.201 --> 12:49.202
as experienced as I am,

12:49.236 --> 12:51.504
is worth, easily,
like, two grand.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.506
Take, that, Saddam.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.408
Last gift, Kevin.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.510
I want the footbath.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.249
That's the thing
I bought myself.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.518
I'm really psyched
to use it.

13:07.320 --> 13:12.292
Maybe I should have
taken the ipod.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.227
Oh, shoot.

13:14.261 --> 13:17.197
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.299
I want the ipod.
Dammit.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.333
Sure you don't want
the teapot?

13:20.367 --> 13:24.037
I mean, it's an ipod.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.038
Right.
Sorry.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.339
No no, definitely.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.277
Okay, well, I guess
I will take

13:30.310 --> 13:32.512
that book
of short stories.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.881
Yes!
There you go.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.184
I want the teapot.
Gracias.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.351
You gotta be kidding me.

13:38.385 --> 13:44.491
Yankee Swap is like
Machiavelli meets...

13:44.524 --> 13:46.493
Christmas.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.963
What is she
so upset about?

13:49.997 --> 13:51.932
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.534
Come on--I think Yankee Swap
was a big hit.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.969
I think it was a success.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.104
And I'm the one
who ended up

13:57.137 --> 13:58.371
with Dwight's stupid
paint ball pellets.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.439
Yeah, but Michael,
the point is

13:59.472 --> 14:01.608
is that we all bought gifts
for specific people.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.376
And you should have just
bought a $20 gift

14:03.410 --> 14:04.477
like everyone else.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.279
Well, I didn't!

14:06.313 --> 14:08.481
I got a big bonus
because I fired Devin,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.183
and I used the money
to buy something awesome.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.251
Sue me!

14:13.553 --> 14:14.922
You got a bonus check?

14:14.955 --> 14:15.989
How much?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.225
Uh, it wasn't...

14:18.258 --> 14:19.559
It wasn't that much.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.228
It was 3,000.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.163
All right, I'm done now.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.068
Unbelievable.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.170
I do the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done

14:30.203 --> 14:31.671
for these people
and they freak out.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.007
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.344
Sorry your party's so lame.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.948
That comes to
166.41.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.215
All right, now,
you're the expert.

14:42.249 --> 14:46.219
Is this enough to get
20 people plastered?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.122
15 bottles of vodka?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.290
Yeah, that should do it.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.325
Cool cool,
box it up.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.695
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

14:55.728 --> 14:58.298
a Merry Christmas *
* We wish you

14:58.331 --> 15:00.267
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

15:00.300 --> 15:01.368
* And a Happy New Year

15:01.401 --> 15:03.403
I bought this teapot
for Pam,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.138
and I know
she really wants it.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.139
So can I trade you for it?

15:06.173 --> 15:07.507
No trades.
Come on.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.476
It's a shamrock keychain.
Good luck.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.478
A real man
makes his own luck.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.280
Billy Zane, Titanic.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.615
Look, it has
sentimental value, Dwight.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.649
Can I buy it from you?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.952
No, I want it.
I'm going to use it.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.020
You don't even drink tea.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.255
True, but I get
sinus infections.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.957
And sinus infections
can be cured

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
by making a tea from
green tea leaf stems

15:26.126 --> 15:28.461
and pouring it directly
into your nose like so.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.400
To think that
my gift to Pam

15:33.433 --> 15:36.970
will be used for that...

15:37.004 --> 15:39.072
it's a little too much
to handle.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.240
This is awesome.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.142
I know, it's totally
gonna change the way

15:42.175 --> 15:43.076
I work out.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.544
Yeah, and I was gonna get you
one of these

15:44.577 --> 15:46.579
for Christmas.
Now I don't have to.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.647
I'm gonna save
a ton of money.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.648
So what are you gonna
get me instead?

15:48.681 --> 15:50.150
I don't know.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.285
Probably like
a sweater or something.

15:55.088 --> 15:59.359
Uh oh, looks like
Santa was a little naughty.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.694
What is that?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.231
This is Christmas spirit.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.266
As in spirits.
Booze.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.667
We can drink?

16:07.700 --> 16:10.237
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.104
Zip it, Toby.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.640
Just--I mean,
it's a party, come on.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.275
If I can't throw
a good party for my employees,

16:15.308 --> 16:16.409
then I am a terrible boss.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.280
Who wants a drink?
Me, please.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.282
Go!
Here we go!

16:22.315 --> 16:25.218
The deal is that
this is my last hurrah.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.220
'Cause I made a New Year's
resolution

16:27.254 --> 16:30.223
that I'm not gonna
drink anymore

16:30.257 --> 16:31.358
during the week.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.226
Hi, guys.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.561
Uh, does everyone
know my boyfriend

16:34.594 --> 16:35.628
Bob Vance?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.297
Kevin Malone.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.332
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.333
Stanley Hudson.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.302
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.503
Ryan Howard.
Bob Vance.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.637
Vance refrigeration.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.309
What line of work
are you in, Bob?

16:49.342 --> 16:53.246
I got--I lost Culpepper at TO,
it was over, man.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.148
Oh yeah, I need McNabb
and Deon Branch

16:55.182 --> 16:57.117
to have big games
or else I'm done.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.418
It's possible.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
I can't believe you traded
Sean Alexander, man.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.621
I had to,
I needed defense.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.156
Come on!
Sean Alexander?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.491
He's the best back
in the league!

17:04.524 --> 17:07.160
Defense.
Oh, no, that's not worth it.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.195
It is worth it.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.163
Are you kidding?
You wait.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.100
Anybody
making out in here?

17:13.133 --> 17:15.202
No yet, give it time.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.303
Oh, hey, Ebenezer.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.304
Boink.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.805
Okay, how's it going in here?

17:18.838 --> 17:20.173
We're running low on cups.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.308
Do you want me to just
run out and--

17:21.341 --> 17:22.175
No no no no no.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.776
We'll find some.
Don't leave the party.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.579
One, two, three!

17:28.481 --> 17:31.284
Gaah!
Ho ho ho!

17:31.318 --> 17:33.786
Kudos to Ryan,
king of the party committee!

17:33.820 --> 17:37.090
Oh, no, I really
did not do anything.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.291
No false modesty,
my friend.

17:38.325 --> 17:42.462
* And boogie all night

17:42.495 --> 17:44.197
You know, you don't have to
answer calls

17:44.231 --> 17:45.632
during a party.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.700
Just thought
you should know.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.071
No, I was just, um,
checking out my present.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.376
I traded with Dwight.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.678
Um, just--I figured,
you know,

17:58.711 --> 18:02.282
you went to a lot of trouble
and that means a lot.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.352
And also Roy
got me an ipod

18:05.385 --> 18:09.356
or was going
to get me an ipod, so...

18:09.389 --> 18:11.891
Well, either way.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.427
This is an amazing gift
because it comes with

18:14.461 --> 18:15.462
bonus gifts.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.498
Look inside.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.637
Oh, my God!

18:24.671 --> 18:27.140
The yearbook picture!

18:27.174 --> 18:30.610
Yeah, I think I made
the right choice.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.347
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.249
Is this the bottle timer?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.184
I didn't think you
were gonna get that one.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.751
I really didn't know.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.255
This is so awesome.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.390
Not bad--and if it couldn't
go to Ryan,

18:43.423 --> 18:45.758
you are the guy
I'd want it to go to.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.859
Thank you.
You're welcome.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.928
Merry Christmas, Asswipe.
No way!

18:48.961 --> 18:52.565
Oh, you're kidding me.
Packer!

18:52.599 --> 18:54.267
Yes!

18:54.301 --> 18:56.636
Todd Packer,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.904
What's up, my nerds?

18:57.937 --> 19:00.373
Check it out!
Oh, no.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.774
Oh, look at that!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.510
Icing on the cake!

19:03.543 --> 19:06.246
Pac man
need a drinky.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.247
Oh, let's fix you up.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.415
Who wants to fix up

19:08.448 --> 19:09.749
Toby's gonna
fix you up.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.451
Whoo!
Yeah.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.755

Christmas in Hollis]

19:15.788 --> 19:18.458
Daryl, here you go.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.492
You earned it.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.194
That's okay, Mike.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.962
No no no no no,
I really want you to have it.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.332
All right.
Thanks, man.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.633
Hey, Merry Christmas.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.603
Whose butt is that?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.439
Mine.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.441
Oh, how did I
not guess that?

19:34.474 --> 19:37.444
Lampshade on the head!

19:37.477 --> 19:38.911
It's happening!

19:49.722 --> 19:53.993
Hey.
Oh, hello there.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.262
What are you doing?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.929
I don't know.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.766
You shouldn't do
things like that.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.234
The man is supposed
to do that.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.615
Thanks for the party,
Michael.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.817
Listen up, we're going to
Poor Richards.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.486
Who's in?
I'm in.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.622
Yes.
Michael?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.357
Poor Richards?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.858
Yeah, that sounds good.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.328
Christmas is awesome.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.329
First of all,

20:29.362 --> 20:32.031
you get to spend time
with people you love.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.866
Secondly,
you can get drunk

20:33.900 --> 20:35.802
and no one
can say anything.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.271
Third, you give presents.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.306
What's better
than giving presents?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.841
And fourth,
getting presents.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.842
So four things.

20:42.875 --> 20:43.810
Not bad for one day.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.879
It's really
the greatest day of all time.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.385
Hey, Meredith, heading over
to Poor Richard's?

20:52.419 --> 20:54.854
Yep.
Cool cool cool.

20:54.887 --> 20:59.726
You need a ride?

21:06.533 --> 21:09.502
All right,
let's head out.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.070
Sounds good.
Do you have a coat?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.306
Yeah.
