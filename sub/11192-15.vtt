WEBVTT

00:26.699 --> 00:28.775
<i>Looks deserted.</i>

00:30.699 --> 00:34.448
O'Neill... I have been here before.

00:35.459 --> 00:38.710
- What? You have?
- Yes.

00:38.658 --> 00:42.953
- This world is called Cartago.
- What can you tell us about it?

00:44.936 --> 00:47.854
The Goa'uld visit here regularly.

00:47.816 --> 00:51.683
It is a favourite place to harvest hosts
for Goa'uld absorption.

00:51.616 --> 00:57.156
I wish you wouldn't say "harvest". They're
human beings, not Brussels sprouts.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.847
- That is how the Goa'uld perceive it.
- So the locals don't like visitors?

01:00.774 --> 01:03.774
That would answer why
no welcome mat, I suppose?

01:04.254 --> 01:08.418
Colonel, this is weird. The food is fresh.
Something's cooking on that fire.

01:10.093 --> 01:12.382
<i>But there's no one around.</i>

01:14.492 --> 01:17.280
Well, keep your heads up.

01:46.686 --> 01:49.307
<i>It hasn't been deserted long.</i>

02:10.762 --> 02:13.550
- Colonel?
- Hold your fire.

02:13.521 --> 02:15.099
They think we're Goa'ulds.

02:15.122 --> 02:18.906
Daniel, think you could find
a language to communicate to them

02:18.842 --> 02:22.543
that we're human like they are,
and that we're friendly?

02:24.080 --> 02:27.580
Why should I believe you?
That is a weapon.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.643
So's that.

02:29.639 --> 02:32.925
Tell you what... I'll go first.

03:11.353 --> 03:12.848
Jaffa!

03:12.872 --> 03:14.415
Hold it!

03:16.352 --> 03:19.602
Jaffa, yes. But he's a good guy.

03:19.551 --> 03:23.929
You don't know him. He's peaceful.
Tell him you're peaceful, Teal'c.

03:23.830 --> 03:26.368
- It is true.
- He lies! I know him!

03:26.349 --> 03:29.552
- How?
- This Jaffa killed my father!

04:36.579 --> 04:39.699
Teal'c... you ever seen this kid before?

04:40.377 --> 04:43.581
- I have not.
- He's a coward. He lies!

04:43.538 --> 04:45.281
Hanno! The mandates.

04:46.778 --> 04:49.612
He's not Byrsa.
The mandates do not apply.

04:50.497 --> 04:54.826
And what if you are mistaken?
I do not recognise this Jaffa.

04:55.735 --> 04:58.060
He is the one! He killed my father!

04:58.055 --> 05:02.136
If you are right,
he will be put through Cor-ai.

05:02.053 --> 05:06.514
We do not take revenge like this.
Or we are no better than the Jaffa.

05:12.293 --> 05:15.663
- Cor-ai will sustain my belief.
- Cor-ai?

05:15.612 --> 05:18.399
But first you meet the elders. Come!

05:23.850 --> 05:26.009
Always wanted to meet the elders.

05:42.048 --> 05:46.045
That's interesting. I wonder if they're
coming from a religious event.

05:45.966 --> 05:49.134
Why does it always have
to be a religious thing with you?

05:49.086 --> 05:51.495
Maybe they're coming from a swap meet.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.985
When the gods come through
the circ kakona, we scatter

05:54.927 --> 05:57.713
to hide from... those who would hurt us.

05:59.165 --> 06:01.490
They are overdue to visit us again.

06:04.843 --> 06:08.711
<i>Circ, that's a Latin derivation - circle.
But kakona, that's Greek.</i>

06:08.644 --> 06:11.598
That's weird.
Two root languages in one culture.

06:11.562 --> 06:16.937
- What does it mean?
- Uh... circ kakona - circle of woes.

06:18.242 --> 06:22.286
- Their name for the Stargate?
- I don't like this.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.786
You may approach.

06:44.596 --> 06:47.266
- You are the leader, yes?
- Yes.

06:47.836 --> 06:50.327
- You may go.
- Just like that?

06:51.076 --> 06:53.697
We'd like to stay a while
and learn from you.

06:53.675 --> 06:56.048
Possibly you can learn from us.

06:56.036 --> 06:59.451
You may go... now.

07:01.154 --> 07:06.029
Daniel, it's important that
we respect our elders.

07:05.913 --> 07:08.036
- Teal'c, dial it up.
- Not him!

07:10.353 --> 07:13.935
- Excuse me?
- For him, there will be Cor-ai.

07:13.872 --> 07:16.992
Let me bottomline it for you.
You can't have that man.

07:16.951 --> 07:18.495
He is not a man, he's Jaffa.

07:18.512 --> 07:21.846
He's already told you
he doesn't know who you are!

07:25.189 --> 07:28.024
- You say you don't remember me?
- I do not.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.196
Then do you remember this?

07:41.827 --> 07:45.872
<i>- Do it!
- Father! Father, no!</i>

07:49.466 --> 07:52.137
Father! No!

07:54.466 --> 07:55.877
Father!

07:59.944 --> 08:01.901
You remember me now, do you not?

08:02.504 --> 08:04.545
- Don't say a word.
- But I must.

08:04.543 --> 08:06.916
That's an order. Don't say anything!

08:08.863 --> 08:12.279
He does not need to say anything.
Take him in custody.

08:12.223 --> 08:15.841
- Hold it!
- Jack, that's not the way to handle this.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.524
I don't suppose we could
get him out on bail?

08:53.017 --> 08:56.931
He is guilty.
He must pay for what he has done.

08:56.855 --> 08:59.394
And you've already decided this?

09:00.174 --> 09:02.000
Yes.

09:02.014 --> 09:06.509
Hey. At least untie his hands. Come on.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.962
Tomorrow we will have the Cor-ai.
You are welcome to stay.

09:13.972 --> 09:16.048
Gee, thanks.

09:20.331 --> 09:24.115
All right, when they come back,
Daniel, you draw 'em in.

09:24.051 --> 09:29.126
- Carter and I'll take right and left flanks.
- Wait, are you talking break-out?

09:29.009 --> 09:31.168
Uh... yeah.

09:31.610 --> 09:36.106
We grab Teal'c and head for the Stargate.
It'd be nice to do it without bloodshed.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.801
No.

09:39.249 --> 09:42.618
- Excuse me?
- Do not attempt your plan.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.774
I will not go.

09:45.606 --> 09:50.731
You know, that's a really odd sound.
I thought you just said you wouldn't go.

09:50.606 --> 09:52.267
- That is correct.
- Why?

09:52.287 --> 09:55.951
- To go would disrespect the Byrsa.
- Disrespect?

09:55.884 --> 09:58.720
Teal'c is right.
We should show some respect.

09:58.684 --> 10:03.181
Did anyone else hear that kid say
that Teal'c was guilty already?

10:03.085 --> 10:06.535
- For all we know they wanna kill him!
- Who mentioned killing?

10:06.484 --> 10:10.812
They want to put him through Cor-ai.
Near as I can figure, it's a simple trial.

10:10.724 --> 10:15.100
It's that "near as I can figure"
part that's got me a little worried.

10:15.001 --> 10:18.869
What if their idea of a simple trial
is a simple beheading?

10:18.802 --> 10:20.878
I will not run.

10:40.398 --> 10:42.225
Excuse me.

10:43.038 --> 10:46.572
- What are you doing?
- I am the Jaffa's voice for the Cor-ai.

10:49.755 --> 10:54.299
- I think his voice is just fine.
- I think she means his defence attorney.

10:54.196 --> 10:58.275
I have been chosen.
I must witness his pecca-ve.

10:58.915 --> 10:59.947
What's a pecca-ve?

11:00.475 --> 11:03.927
There's a similar Latin word.
It means "I have sinned."

11:03.875 --> 11:06.745
She wants his confession?

11:06.714 --> 11:10.082
Has it occurred to anyone
that he might not be guilty?

11:10.033 --> 11:12.821
If he were not guilty,
there would be no Cor-ai.

11:21.831 --> 11:25.615
Innocent until proven guilty. Heard of it?

11:27.629 --> 11:29.586
Actually, the idea's pretty rare.

11:29.590 --> 11:32.625
Most cultures assume things
the other way around.

11:32.590 --> 11:34.998
I'm just saying.

11:38.389 --> 11:41.009
I must hear the Jaffa's pecca-ve.

11:41.187 --> 11:44.307
Well, you're not gonna
get him to "pecca" anything.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.841
Then who will be his voice?

11:48.586 --> 11:50.663
That would be me.

11:53.186 --> 11:55.095
Uh... you?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.893
- You will be his voice for the Cor-ai?
- Yep.

12:00.466 --> 12:03.038
As you wish. I will tell the elders.

12:13.224 --> 12:15.429
You sure you're up to this?

12:16.062 --> 12:18.101
Why? You don't think I am?

12:18.422 --> 12:20.995
I've never heard you
referred to as a diplomat.

12:20.981 --> 12:24.019
I think, um, "antagonist"
was the word used.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.519
But I'm his commanding officer.

12:26.740 --> 12:33.240
Wouldn't Daniel be better at it, being
a linguist and a cultural expert... sir?

12:34.578 --> 12:37.745
All right, we'll all do it. How's that?

12:40.099 --> 12:45.472
- That's fine.
- Co... co-counsels. Works for me.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.525
I am sorry.

13:40.768 --> 13:42.890
You are sorry?

13:42.888 --> 13:47.965
When I first saw you, I let my anger
control me and I threatened your life.

13:49.047 --> 13:51.585
This is counter to Byrsa mandates,

13:51.567 --> 13:55.232
and, by doing it, I shamed myself
and my whole clan.

13:55.686 --> 13:57.807
I ask your forgiveness.

13:58.725 --> 14:00.801
You have it.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.532
This is startin' off better
than I thought it would.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.552
Jaffa...

14:14.562 --> 14:16.639
you killed my father.

14:16.643 --> 14:20.011
For this crime, the punishment is death.

14:21.121 --> 14:24.572
- I will now lead the Cor-ai.
- Objection!

14:29.159 --> 14:31.782
That's something we say
back on Earth when...

14:33.759 --> 14:35.798
Never mind.

14:35.798 --> 14:39.500
You can't be the judge. That's not fair.

14:40.038 --> 14:42.659
- Judge?
- The guy who controls proceedings,

14:42.638 --> 14:45.591
- Decides what happens here.
- Why is it not fair?

14:45.557 --> 14:48.263
- Because you're the son of the victim.
- Yes.

14:49.716 --> 14:53.927
- The judge has to be impartial.
- What does that mean?

14:55.235 --> 14:58.854
Impartiality requires someone
who hasn't formed an opinion

14:58.794 --> 15:01.285
about Teal'c's guilt or innocence.

15:01.274 --> 15:06.614
How could there be such a person?
Anyone who has a mind has an opinion.

15:06.474 --> 15:12.346
Your Honours, I respectfully request
that someone else be in control of this...

15:12.192 --> 15:13.984
- What is it?
- Cor-ai.

15:13.991 --> 15:16.234
Cor-ai.

15:19.672 --> 15:21.664
Only the person who has suffered

15:21.671 --> 15:25.620
understands the pain
which has been inflicted.

15:26.071 --> 15:29.571
Who else can fairly say
what the punishment must be?

15:31.149 --> 15:33.356
Well, you could, for one.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.647
Hanno will continue.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.701
- Unbelievable.
- It's Talmudic.

15:41.707 --> 15:45.456
- Only he who is wronged can...
- Will you can it?

15:54.905 --> 15:57.397
You remember me?

15:57.385 --> 15:59.294
I do.

16:00.945 --> 16:03.518
And you are the one
who killed my father?

16:03.504 --> 16:05.961
Don't answer that, Teal'c.

16:09.024 --> 16:10.815
Yes.

16:10.822 --> 16:14.109
I am the one who killed your father.

16:36.698 --> 16:40.198
<i>Teal'c, are you
trying to commit suicide?</i>

16:40.139 --> 16:43.756
- I do not understand.
- Why didn't you tell me you were guilty?

16:43.697 --> 16:48.407
At least before you told a room full
of people that wanna see you dead.

16:48.298 --> 16:52.793
You already knew.
Only you did not want to hear it.

16:53.895 --> 16:56.565
That is why you asked me not to speak.

17:04.015 --> 17:07.762
- What happened?
- Apophis ordered me to kill his father.

17:11.492 --> 17:14.243
Hey, can you guys guard from outside?

17:16.893 --> 17:18.969
We're not goin' anywhere.

17:21.492 --> 17:23.236
So you were following orders?

17:23.251 --> 17:28.756
Hanno's father died by my hand.
No one else's.

17:28.611 --> 17:30.686
I am responsible.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.364
What I did while serving Apophis
I will not hide from.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.623
- Even if the punishment is death?
- Then that is what I deserve.

17:38.568 --> 17:40.561
You sound like you wanna die.

17:40.568 --> 17:44.780
Colonel O'Neill, have you ever
faced the crying eyes of a child

17:44.686 --> 17:47.557
whose father you have just murdered?

17:49.326 --> 17:51.403
Not exactly.

17:54.405 --> 17:59.317
Teal'c, there are a lot of things... we do...

18:00.286 --> 18:04.329
that we wish we could change,
and we sure as hell can't forget.

18:04.605 --> 18:10.441
But the concept of chain of command
undermines the idea of free will.

18:10.284 --> 18:15.361
So, as soldiers, we have to do
some pretty awful stuff.

18:16.282 --> 18:19.318
But we're following orders
like we were trained to.

18:19.281 --> 18:23.066
It doesn't make it easier.
It certainly doesn't make it right.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.500
But it puts responsibility
on the guy giving those orders.

18:26.442 --> 18:29.395
Then you are saying
Apophis is responsible?

18:29.361 --> 18:32.811
- Yes!
- You are wrong, O'Neill.

18:32.760 --> 18:36.593
While in the service of Apophis
I did many things.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.627
For these deeds
my victims deserve retribution.

18:40.598 --> 18:43.718
Can we focus on this one case
only for now, please?

18:43.677 --> 18:47.047
- This case represents the many.
- Well, it shouldn't!

18:53.876 --> 18:56.747
Why?

18:56.715 --> 18:59.502
Why are you doing this?

18:59.474 --> 19:04.634
When I look into Hanno's eyes, I see
the horror on the faces of many others,

19:04.515 --> 19:08.097
as their loved ones prepare
for Goa'uld absorption.

19:08.035 --> 19:12.078
<i>Worse yet is the face of the victims,
whom I selected,</i>

19:11.993 --> 19:16.204
as they realise they are about
to take their final human breath.

19:16.113 --> 19:20.109
Hanno's father's not the first
nor the last of the lives I've taken.

19:20.031 --> 19:22.866
And I have done far worse, O'Neill.

19:24.510 --> 19:28.425
I cannot give all of their loved ones
retribution.

19:28.351 --> 19:31.352
But I can at least give it to this one.

19:32.868 --> 19:35.194
I am sorry, O'Neill.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.109
I will not run.

19:39.148 --> 19:42.232
Well, I'm sorry, Teal'c,
but that's unacceptable.

19:43.388 --> 19:47.848
I'm gonna do what I have to do to keep
you alive, whether you like it or not.

19:58.546 --> 20:02.758
- What's the plan of attack?
- Well, Teal'c has already plead guilty.

20:02.664 --> 20:05.951
So, to draw a parallel to an American trial,

20:05.904 --> 20:08.775
we have to look at this
as, like, the sentencing phase.

20:08.743 --> 20:12.409
We need to prove to these people
that he doesn't deserve to die.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.669
How do we do that?

20:14.663 --> 20:17.451
We need to convince them
that he's different now.

20:17.423 --> 20:19.083
Good luck.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.125
Tell us what happened to your wife.

20:35.779 --> 20:38.152
Her name is Sha're.

20:38.137 --> 20:42.468
She was captured by Apophis's
serpent guards and... changed.

20:42.378 --> 20:46.211
- She's now a Goa'uld?
- Inhabited by one, yes.

20:46.136 --> 20:48.378
How did she get to be one of the victims?

20:48.377 --> 20:52.244
The leader of the serpent guards
picked her out of a crowd at random.

20:52.176 --> 20:54.929
- Who was this serpent guard?
- Teal'c.

20:54.895 --> 20:57.518
<i>He must be punished.</i>

21:01.135 --> 21:04.089
The old Teal'c.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.306
He hadn't joined us yet.
He didn't know me or Sha're.

21:07.255 --> 21:12.877
But you now work side by side with
the man responsible for your wife's fate.

21:13.932 --> 21:17.468
It was difficult for me at first.
I wanted to hate him.

21:17.413 --> 21:21.244
But now I know that it was
a different Teal'c that chose Sha're.

21:21.173 --> 21:24.873
I know that if there were any way
for him to help me get her back,

21:24.811 --> 21:26.887
this Teal'c would do it gladly.

21:27.931 --> 21:31.016
Even if it meant giving up his own life.

21:32.570 --> 21:34.858
This Teal'c is my friend.

21:37.609 --> 21:41.903
There were 50 human captives.
All were unarmed.

21:43.769 --> 21:47.552
- Apophis ordered me to slaughter them.
- But you didn't, did you?

21:47.488 --> 21:50.239
- I did not.
- What did you do?

21:53.247 --> 21:56.531
I turned my weapon
on my fellow serpent guards.

21:56.486 --> 21:59.605
- It was a huge risk, wasn't it?
- I made a decision.

21:59.566 --> 22:02.602
I think you're being a little modest here.

22:02.566 --> 22:06.101
You have a family.
Do you think you'll ever see them again?

22:11.044 --> 22:13.616
It is unlikely.

22:27.559 --> 22:29.470
Have you lost your way?

22:29.480 --> 22:32.980
No, I'm just looking around, if that's OK.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.240
You're welcome to do so.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.111
You have a very lovely existence.

22:39.078 --> 22:40.538
Thank you.

22:40.558 --> 22:45.055
It would be made lovelier were it not
for the Goa'ulds and the Jaffa.

22:46.317 --> 22:51.063
The one thing I can't seem
to figure out is... where you live.

22:50.957 --> 22:53.281
We live here.

22:53.276 --> 22:57.569
No, where do you sleep... at night?
Where do you take shelter?

22:57.476 --> 23:01.344
- We sleep in the hiding.
- The hiding?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.790
We have hidden caves
and tunnels in all directions.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.548
When the evil ones come in
through the circ kakona,

23:08.513 --> 23:11.266
we flee in all directions and we disappear.

23:12.713 --> 23:15.204
So they catch only
the slowest among you?

23:15.192 --> 23:18.728
No. We would never leave anyone behind.

23:18.672 --> 23:21.292
We all go, or none of us do.

23:26.351 --> 23:29.137
I think I have something
that might help us out.

23:29.111 --> 23:33.273
Teal'c... tell us exactly
what happened that day.

23:34.628 --> 23:38.578
Apophis ordered me to kill a villager,
so the rest would obey.

23:38.509 --> 23:43.634
<i>We've heard the Reader's Digest version,
but there's more to it, isn't there?</i>

23:43.509 --> 23:46.082
Like why you chose Hanno's father.

23:47.548 --> 23:50.750
We brought those we had captured
back to the hall.

23:50.708 --> 23:53.791
Apophis ordered the selection
process to begin.

23:57.425 --> 24:02.005
<i>- Leave us alone! Leave us alone!
- You can't leave us here!</i>

24:01.904 --> 24:03.980
<i>Teal'c.</i>

24:07.423 --> 24:10.046
Kill one of them!

24:18.063 --> 24:20.304
I said "Kill one of them."

24:21.142 --> 24:23.846
If you hesitate, I will kill them all.

24:36.299 --> 24:37.330
Do it!

24:40.778 --> 24:43.400
<i>Father! No!</i>

24:47.017 --> 24:48.476
No!

24:51.737 --> 24:54.309
Father! No!

25:01.295 --> 25:04.829
<i>Apophis chose seven women
and let the rest go.</i>

25:06.413 --> 25:08.571
The truth is our defence.

25:08.574 --> 25:12.820
I see where you're going. This could
make the difference in the Cor-ai.

25:12.733 --> 25:16.647
It's a kangaroo court.
Nothing's gonna make a difference.

25:16.573 --> 25:19.325
Isn't that painfully obvious to anybody?

25:19.291 --> 25:21.748
That kid made up his mind
before we got here.

25:21.731 --> 25:24.020
So what do you suggest?

25:24.692 --> 25:27.182
We'll go back to Earth for reinforcements.

25:27.171 --> 25:31.334
- You're gonna shoot his way out?
- No, Daniel!

25:31.250 --> 25:37.005
Maybe we can bring enough fire power
to scare 'em into turning Teal'c over.

25:36.848 --> 25:39.090
I have told you, O'Neill, I will not run.

25:39.089 --> 25:43.170
Teal'c, you're goin' back with us if I have
to knock ya out and carry ya myself.

25:43.088 --> 25:44.749
Got it?

25:44.768 --> 25:47.438
Buy as much time as you can, Daniel.

25:52.527 --> 25:55.362
- Where are Teal'c and Daniel?
- We'll explain.

25:55.326 --> 25:59.988
First, I need you to mobilise a combat unit
ready to go back to that planet ASAP.

25:59.885 --> 26:01.165
Do it.

26:01.204 --> 26:03.280
Now, how about filling me in?

26:07.525 --> 26:11.569
So, by killing that man, you saved
the lives of the rest of the villagers.

26:11.482 --> 26:15.528
- You even saved Hanno's life.
- It is true.

26:15.443 --> 26:20.355
But can you be sure Apophis would have
really killed the rest of the villagers?

26:20.242 --> 26:22.650
I have seen him do it many times.

26:22.642 --> 26:25.761
So although you were faced
with a terrible decision,

26:25.721 --> 26:27.798
you chose the lesser of two evils.

26:27.799 --> 26:31.845
He chose to kill a crippled man,
the man least able to run away,

26:31.760 --> 26:33.836
the most helpless of us all.

26:33.839 --> 26:37.173
His choice was not moral.
It was cowardly and evil.

26:37.118 --> 26:41.068
Hanno... I'm told the Byrsas'
only defence against the Goa'ulds

26:40.999 --> 26:43.834
is their ability to run and hide.

26:43.798 --> 26:46.336
Is that right?

26:46.317 --> 26:48.606
We have escape tunnels and caves.

26:49.797 --> 26:52.002
When the lights
on the circ kakona appear,

26:51.997 --> 26:55.163
we can disappear
before the Goa'uld arrive.

26:55.116 --> 26:59.197
- But you have to move fast, right?
- Of course.

26:59.115 --> 27:01.192
<i>What's he trying to say?</i>

27:02.234 --> 27:05.402
- Teal'c, did you know that back then?
- I did.

27:06.634 --> 27:10.680
It was often very difficult
to locate the villagers.

27:10.593 --> 27:15.255
They seemed to be able to vanish into
the forest as quickly as a flock of birds.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.923
How fast could your father
move with only one leg?

27:24.271 --> 27:28.897
It was not important. As a member of
the clan, he would never be left behind.

27:28.791 --> 27:34.212
In other words, your group can only move
as fast as its slowest member, right?

27:37.189 --> 27:41.602
- Why did you choose Hanno's father?
- I saw his injury.

27:42.828 --> 27:46.661
I knew that without him
the group could move more quickly.

27:46.587 --> 27:50.252
- Perhaps evade us next time we came.
- I will not hear this!

27:50.188 --> 27:54.766
You made a decision. You chose
to kill one that day to save many later.

27:54.666 --> 27:57.702
- Is that right?
- It is correct.

27:58.865 --> 28:01.784
So if Teal'c hadn't made that decision,

28:01.746 --> 28:05.328
many of you might not
be alive today to want him dead!

28:08.265 --> 28:12.179
I do not understand
the relevance of any of this.

28:13.743 --> 28:16.068
I'm trying to prove that he's a good man.

28:16.064 --> 28:20.441
He is very important to all of us
in fighting the Goa'ulds and the Jaffa.

28:20.343 --> 28:22.881
Therefore, I ask that you spare his life.

28:26.941 --> 28:31.233
You have defended this Jaffa repeatedly
by saying he is a changed man.

28:31.141 --> 28:35.269
For proof, you have given examples
of his firing upon his former comrades.

28:35.180 --> 28:38.346
- Yes.
- Why did he not fire upon them here?

28:38.299 --> 28:41.253
- It wouldn't have helped.
- My father might be alive!

28:41.218 --> 28:45.262
No. Not necessarily. Even if
Teal'c had succeeded that day,

28:45.179 --> 28:49.508
the Goa'uld would've sent more Jaffa
to exterminate your entire population!

28:49.417 --> 28:51.789
They did not do that to your people.

28:51.777 --> 28:55.229
They tried. We have
defences that you don't.

28:58.175 --> 29:01.342
Teal'c may have killed Hanno's father.

29:02.096 --> 29:07.682
But, in doing so, he saved you
and you and all of you!

29:07.535 --> 29:09.611
His death will not change the past,

29:09.614 --> 29:13.741
but his continued life
can help all of our future.

29:13.653 --> 29:17.271
Can you really justify killing him now?

29:18.853 --> 29:22.803
His fate is not to be decided by us.

29:22.732 --> 29:27.061
Cor-ai mandates that only
Hanno can make that decision.

29:33.250 --> 29:37.116
Your argument is wise and moving.
I commend you.

29:38.169 --> 29:39.248
Thank you.

29:42.367 --> 29:48.122
You have made a compelling argument
that this Jaffa's more recent good

29:47.968 --> 29:51.134
should somehow negate his past evil.

29:52.406 --> 29:55.159
I have but one final question.

29:57.125 --> 30:01.953
Can his recent actions
or any future actions

30:01.845 --> 30:03.968
return my father from the dead?

30:06.444 --> 30:09.231
No. No, of course not...

30:09.204 --> 30:12.039
Then, clearly, no amount
of good in the present

30:12.003 --> 30:15.171
can erase what he has done in the past.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.655
Jaffa...

30:20.642 --> 30:23.346
you are guilty of killing my father.

30:24.961 --> 30:28.046
Tomorrow at midday

30:30.441 --> 30:33.809
you will die by your own weapon.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.556
As my father did.

30:56.836 --> 31:00.122
I'm confused, Captain.
Are these people hostiles?

31:00.076 --> 31:02.992
That would depend on
your definition of hostiles.

31:02.955 --> 31:06.655
They have Teal'c prisoner and plan
to execute him. I call that hostile.

31:06.595 --> 31:10.426
But it sounds as if they've treated
the rest of you with respect.

31:10.354 --> 31:13.270
- You want to launch an assault on them?
- No, sir.

31:13.233 --> 31:17.811
I'm hoping once they see our fire power,
they'll release him without incident.

31:17.712 --> 31:23.501
The United States is not in the business
of interfering in other people's affairs.

31:25.471 --> 31:28.388
- Since when?
- Since this administration was elected.

31:28.352 --> 31:32.135
The president wouldn't mind us
trying to rescue one of our own.

31:32.069 --> 31:34.857
- Teal'c is not one of our own.
- He's not?

31:34.829 --> 31:37.830
I mean, in the eyes of the government.
He's not American.

31:37.789 --> 31:42.250
- He's not even an Earth citizen.
- I don't believe I'm hearing this from you.

31:42.148 --> 31:44.686
General Hammond, sir, if I may...

31:44.669 --> 31:46.993
Setting aside that Teal'c is our friend,

31:46.988 --> 31:50.153
how can you let such a valuable
resource be taken away?

31:50.106 --> 31:53.143
These people's laws are
no different from our own.

31:53.106 --> 31:56.393
We don't stop pursuing war criminals
because they change.

31:56.346 --> 31:59.596
- War criminals?
- Yes, Colonel, he is!

31:59.546 --> 32:04.587
What the Jaffa have done to these people,
and thousands of other people is a crime.

32:05.305 --> 32:10.430
Teal'c spent years serving the Goa'uld
doing some damn distasteful things.

32:10.305 --> 32:14.551
Surely you must realise that this
was bound to happen sooner or later.

32:14.463 --> 32:20.252
General Hammond, I have spent a lot
of years in the service of my country,

32:20.102 --> 32:23.554
and I have been ordered to do
some damn distasteful things.

32:25.461 --> 32:28.748
I will not allow them to execute my friend.

32:28.701 --> 32:31.820
Teal'c has proven his loyalty
to us countless times.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.022
Don't you think we should do the same?

32:34.020 --> 32:37.390
My own personal opinion says yes.

32:37.338 --> 32:41.799
But the government policies under which
I must weigh my decisions say no.

32:41.700 --> 32:45.614
- Well, fine, let's call the president!
- That's enough, Colonel!

32:52.977 --> 32:56.181
General, sir, we don't
have a lot of time here.

32:57.616 --> 32:59.692
Right.

33:20.451 --> 33:25.030
- What are they doing?
- Preparing me for my death.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.366
Oh.

33:37.528 --> 33:40.815
- I would like to ask one final favour.
- What is it?

33:40.769 --> 33:43.971
I would like to volunteer my lifeless body

33:43.929 --> 33:47.547
and that of my symbiote
for your scientists to study.

33:47.488 --> 33:50.987
Perhaps you can learn ways
to battle the Goa'uld and the Jaffa.

33:50.926 --> 33:54.509
Don't worry, Teal'c. There's not
gonna be any body to donate.

33:54.447 --> 33:56.736
They'll be back any minute
with the troops.

33:56.726 --> 33:58.635
Daniel Jackson,

33:58.645 --> 34:03.641
you must not allow Colonel O'Neill
to deny the retribution the Byrsa deserve.

34:03.525 --> 34:07.771
You know, I have to admit, Teal'c,
for once I agree with Jack.

34:07.684 --> 34:12.393
I mean, I respect your wishes,
but I don't believe that you deserve to die.

34:20.802 --> 34:24.135
I'm sorry. The president
won't authorise a rescue.

34:24.081 --> 34:25.576
- I don't believe it.
- What?

34:25.601 --> 34:28.010
I agree with the president's decision.

34:28.001 --> 34:33.126
We can't commit troops to risk their lives
in an action that is morally ambiguous.

34:33.001 --> 34:36.619
- That's where I disagree.
- You have the right to disagree,

34:36.559 --> 34:41.766
but you do not have the right to take
actions against orders. Understood?

34:49.038 --> 34:52.204
<i>Things look
a little different to you?</i>

34:58.237 --> 35:01.403
<i>- This way. This way.
- Move quickly!</i>

35:03.036 --> 35:05.112
<i>They burned our village.</i>

35:20.193 --> 35:22.518
Byrsa must have taken him with them.

35:22.512 --> 35:27.423
- Let's hope it was the Byrsa.
- Maybe Daniel broke him out.

35:27.311 --> 35:30.811
Keep those positive thoughts
coming, Captain. Let's go.

36:05.105 --> 36:08.722
O'Neill has proved to me
where his loyalties lie, and yours.

36:08.664 --> 36:11.498
If you believe he informed them,
you are mistaken.

36:11.465 --> 36:13.456
- They know our escape routes.
- What?

36:13.463 --> 36:16.465
We are trapped, cut off from the hidings.

36:16.423 --> 36:19.507
Jack went to Earth.
The Goa'uld figured it out on their own.

36:19.463 --> 36:23.876
The children and the slowest will hide.
The rest of us will try to draw them away.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.318
Let Teal'c go. He can help you.
He is no good to you like this.

36:27.262 --> 36:32.931
- I give you my word he won't run away.
- No, he will not. You will stay here.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.789
If I do not survive,
I entrust you to tell whoever does

36:37.739 --> 36:40.905
that I still wish my sentence
to be carried out.

37:19.293 --> 37:21.831
Try not to let them see your face in case...

37:24.972 --> 37:27.510
- Teal'c.
- Shak'l.

37:36.610 --> 37:38.686
Go.

37:44.088 --> 37:49.331
Your death will assure
my place as first prime.

37:54.646 --> 37:56.806
I'm sorry.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.896
Hey!

38:42.918 --> 38:45.670
Oh! Looks bad. Let's get him home.

38:45.958 --> 38:47.867
No.

39:06.795 --> 39:09.001
It is midday.

39:08.994 --> 39:12.329
- I am prepared to accept my punishment.
- Teal'c.

39:33.351 --> 39:36.351
You would save those
who wish to kill you?

39:36.311 --> 39:38.980
I would save those who deserve to live.

39:45.427 --> 39:47.670
I have made a mistake.

39:49.628 --> 39:51.916
My memory was faulty.

39:53.547 --> 39:56.253
You are not the same man
who murdered my father.

39:56.226 --> 39:58.349
I am the one.

39:59.226 --> 40:01.896
No. That Jaffa is dead.

40:03.706 --> 40:05.829
You have killed him.

40:07.465 --> 40:10.382
