WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.249
Previously on Harrow...

00:02.623 --> 00:04.576
A finger, severed.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.529
I don't know. It looks
mechanically cut to me.

00:06.554 --> 00:07.914
I mean, look at these ridges.

00:08.054 --> 00:09.373
It is an orthopaedic plate.

00:09.514 --> 00:12.577
We can look this up and find
out exactly who this guy is.

00:12.738 --> 00:14.577
Who keeps the serial numbers on file?

00:14.612 --> 00:16.911
You could track
down all of the ortho-surgeons

00:16.936 --> 00:18.295
that worked here in the '90s.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.857
Are you in trouble too?

00:20.095 --> 00:21.297
The police are coming.

00:21.417 --> 00:22.898
I know what they're looking for,

00:23.038 --> 00:25.087
but it doesn't have to be
here when they arrive.

00:25.163 --> 00:27.130
I want to check
if Harrow was working here

00:27.155 --> 00:28.754
on October 3rd last year,

00:28.834 --> 00:31.095
the date Robert Quinn
made his last phone call

00:31.132 --> 00:32.442
and his car went into the dam.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.555
These asterisks.
They're only there on this day.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.695
October 3rd.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.556
You guys had an outage late that night.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.553
Dr Harrow phoned through all the times.

00:39.822 --> 00:43.148
Dan, I'm so sorry. Jack has a DNR.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

02:29.089 --> 02:31.342
What a time you picked to go, Jack.

02:34.096 --> 02:35.804
I know you said no confessions,

02:35.829 --> 02:37.892
but someone is going
to have to hear this.

02:40.901 --> 02:42.636
I wish it was you.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.938
You might even get it.

02:48.009 --> 02:51.464
You might even understand
why I had to do it.

02:56.655 --> 02:58.655
The thing is, he...

03:03.676 --> 03:04.956
Sorry, Jack.

03:05.015 --> 03:06.576
I'm the only one rostered on.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.290
Public holiday.

03:19.168 --> 03:20.567
Murder-suicide.

03:20.629 --> 03:21.709
Who declared death?

03:21.734 --> 03:22.734
Paramedics.

03:22.759 --> 03:24.020
They took off in a hurry.

03:25.068 --> 03:26.628
Devlin.

03:32.582 --> 03:34.261
You knew him?

03:34.422 --> 03:35.821
Yes, blood specialist.

03:35.846 --> 03:37.135
Good doctor.

03:37.962 --> 03:40.218
So I suppose I can expect
someone from homicide.

03:40.436 --> 03:42.475
Not sure when, though. Public holiday.

03:42.862 --> 03:45.422
OK, well, I'll get these prepped.

04:13.449 --> 04:15.049
You might have called first.

04:16.975 --> 04:18.676
It's a holiday.

04:21.956 --> 04:23.995
On the afternoon of October 3rd,

04:24.109 --> 04:27.268
Quinn's phone received
a call from this number.

04:27.676 --> 04:29.548
It's a public phone
booth located just...

04:29.573 --> 04:31.476
Yeah, but we know where it is.

04:32.909 --> 04:35.906
Quinn's mobile spent
just over two hours

04:35.931 --> 04:37.259
in that area on the same night,

04:37.284 --> 04:38.264
October 3rd.
-Yeah,

04:38.289 --> 04:39.300
we know that too.

04:39.325 --> 04:40.987
Then it heads out west,
it goes black...

04:41.012 --> 04:42.864
And Quinn's car went into the dam.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.677
What are you saying?

04:46.155 --> 04:47.994
This area here

04:48.075 --> 04:50.034
is within walking
distance to the Bettie.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.349
This is the state's most
respected pathologist

04:57.374 --> 04:58.714
you are talking about.

04:59.955 --> 05:02.119
Jesus, Dass, this is your boyfriend.

05:04.051 --> 05:05.796
Harrow has a solid alibi.

05:06.628 --> 05:08.434
He was at Turbot Street October 3rd.

05:08.459 --> 05:10.658
He didn't clock off until
3am the following day.

05:10.835 --> 05:12.395
That's what his work log says.

05:14.402 --> 05:16.442
OK, look, we've considered all of this.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.702
But not this.

05:20.081 --> 05:21.254
This is four days

05:21.279 --> 05:23.345
before Quinn's bones were
pulled from the river.

05:23.668 --> 05:25.534
And here.

05:25.975 --> 05:28.947
That finger bone was cut
with a serrated blade.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.367
These shears might be serrated.

05:31.722 --> 05:34.009
Well, maybe. I mean, it's
beyond my poor bloody eyes.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.460
What, have you seen these yourself?

05:35.485 --> 05:37.355
No, but I've seen the kit on his boat.

05:37.509 --> 05:38.742
He keeps it locked.

05:40.755 --> 05:42.835
It's not enough, Sergeant.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.756
Did a good job on that.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.757
I really think you ought to sit down.

06:58.614 --> 06:59.933
This isn't the hospital.

07:00.042 --> 07:01.801
No, it's not.

07:02.302 --> 07:03.977
It's the morgue.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.276
Am I dead?

07:05.709 --> 07:07.342
Well, everyone thought you were.

07:08.855 --> 07:11.694
I'd say the impact of your fall
suppressed your heartbeat

07:11.719 --> 07:15.118
long enough for the paramedics
to make the fair call

07:15.182 --> 07:17.559
that you were dead.

07:19.215 --> 07:20.855
It's Tom, isn't it?

07:21.355 --> 07:23.599
I really think you ought to
let me call you an ambulance.

07:23.635 --> 07:24.874
Be quiet.

07:25.102 --> 07:26.187
Those broken bones...

07:26.212 --> 07:27.427
Be quiet.

07:46.322 --> 07:48.361
You know my name.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.081
Now, what's yours?

07:50.148 --> 07:51.677
Please, let me call you an ambulance.

07:51.702 --> 07:54.103
You're not going to save
my life. I don't want it.

07:54.455 --> 07:56.142
What I want to know is...

07:56.995 --> 08:00.071
What's your name?
-Daniel.

08:06.762 --> 08:08.161
Daniel Harrow.

08:08.715 --> 08:09.843
Yes.

08:09.868 --> 08:11.934
Well, it's not all bad news, is it?

08:12.195 --> 08:13.554
Do you know me?

08:13.754 --> 08:15.514
Yeah, I know you.

08:20.656 --> 08:22.529
Now I've just got to decide

08:23.028 --> 08:25.506
whether I stick this
into your heart too.

08:29.895 --> 08:31.254
I've told Nichols about this,

08:31.279 --> 08:34.764
I've told Daniel's new
girlfriend about it and now you.

08:34.876 --> 08:37.520
Why did you care about
Robert's wedding band?

08:37.669 --> 08:39.047
When did you get it back?

08:39.308 --> 08:40.948
I'm taking you off
the Christmas card list.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.705
Do you remember when you
got it back? Which day?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.372
No. Why do you care?

08:45.397 --> 08:47.596
Was it late September,
or early October...?

08:47.635 --> 08:49.372
Simon.
-Was it before or after

08:49.397 --> 08:50.492
you reported Robert missing?

08:50.517 --> 08:53.060
Wow. I know that Robert is dead

08:53.085 --> 08:55.089
and I know that you have
his body in your morgue,

08:55.114 --> 08:56.194
but this is very personal.

08:56.219 --> 08:58.258
It's really personal to me too, Steph.

09:01.349 --> 09:02.708
Why are you asking me this?

09:02.733 --> 09:04.772
Why isn't Dan?

09:04.849 --> 09:06.309
You have to trust me.

09:07.102 --> 09:09.662
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

09:12.674 --> 09:14.036
It's funny.

09:15.082 --> 09:16.839
This doesn't even hurt one little bit.

09:16.896 --> 09:19.725
I guess there is an upside
to falling five storeys.

09:19.909 --> 09:21.180
The other is

09:21.222 --> 09:23.861
it lets me reconnect
with the two people

09:23.989 --> 09:25.389
that ruined everything.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.155
Do you want me to guess
how you know me, Tom?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.762
I want you to feel

09:30.836 --> 09:33.761
like your whole life is
in someone else's hands.

09:37.235 --> 09:38.795
This is Bill Devlin.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.304
Haematologist.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.519
A very good haematologist.

09:42.562 --> 09:43.840
Why did you kill him?

09:43.865 --> 09:46.342
Well, you're supposed to be
very good too, Dr Harrow.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.596
Why don't you tell me?

09:50.149 --> 09:52.069
Very well.

09:53.868 --> 09:58.347
Single stab wound heading up
from under the sternum,

09:58.569 --> 10:00.648
probably straight into
the right ventricle.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.709
Likely died within a minute.

10:03.262 --> 10:06.883
No sign of a struggle, no
other wounds that I can see.

10:07.162 --> 10:08.961
Did you surprise him?

10:09.161 --> 10:11.025
No, you were in his office.

10:13.969 --> 10:16.408
So he knew you well
enough to let you in.

10:16.476 --> 10:17.956
He knew me well enough.

10:19.655 --> 10:21.614
Did you have a blood condition?

10:22.095 --> 10:24.111
Did he misdiagnose you?

10:24.442 --> 10:25.889
Is that why you killed yourself,

10:25.914 --> 10:27.711
because you had nothing to lose?

10:33.922 --> 10:35.479
My blood is just fine.

10:35.609 --> 10:37.409
But you still had nothing to lose.

10:39.075 --> 10:40.874
Because you already lost it.

10:41.002 --> 10:42.181
Parent?

10:42.248 --> 10:43.408
Child?

10:45.997 --> 10:47.476
Your wife?

10:52.596 --> 10:54.116
You lost your wife.

10:54.771 --> 10:56.516
Very good, Dr Harrow.

11:05.213 --> 11:07.881
I was in hospital on the third.

11:08.016 --> 11:09.815
Robert hit me in the stomach...

11:10.182 --> 11:11.484
..hard.

11:11.689 --> 11:14.574
And it was hurting a lot and I
thought something was damaged

11:14.659 --> 11:16.741
and they kept me in, did an MRI.

11:17.116 --> 11:18.686
Broken rib.
-God, Steph, I...

11:18.797 --> 11:21.084
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
-And the next day

11:21.349 --> 11:22.764
they discharged me

11:22.789 --> 11:24.014
and it was the day after that, I think,

11:24.038 --> 11:26.758
I'm sure, that I found
it in the letterbox.

11:27.369 --> 11:28.569
The fifth?

11:28.677 --> 11:31.703
That was two days after
Robert's car was sunk.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.650
You think it wasn't Robert
who put the ring in there?

12:08.062 --> 12:09.301
What was your wife's name?

12:09.529 --> 12:11.715
It wasn't Pinfold, I would
have remembered that.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.355
Come on, Harrow.

12:13.829 --> 12:15.282
You can do better than that.

12:15.307 --> 12:20.586
If it was a misdiagnosis, you
would have tried to sue him.

12:20.676 --> 12:23.376
And lost and appealed and lost again,

12:23.401 --> 12:25.078
so that would have taken time.

12:26.302 --> 12:27.701
Fatal disease.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.636
Wilkie?

12:30.622 --> 12:32.299
Wilkie, yes.

12:32.715 --> 12:34.675
Karen.
-Katie.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.134
Kept her surname.

12:37.235 --> 12:38.784
Katie Wilkie, yes.

12:38.889 --> 12:40.089
I did a post mortem.

12:40.114 --> 12:41.561
Yeah, you did.

12:42.222 --> 12:44.221
You agreed with him.

12:44.302 --> 12:46.773
You agreed that this
great haematologist

12:46.879 --> 12:48.317
could do nothing to help her.

12:48.369 --> 12:50.125
Yes.
-You were wrong.

12:50.235 --> 12:51.834
I wasn't wrong, no.

12:52.036 --> 12:53.556
Katie Wilkie.

12:54.256 --> 12:57.775
Your wife had two serious diseases.

12:58.082 --> 13:01.441
Hemochromatosis and
HLH-Hemophagocytosis.

13:01.535 --> 13:03.294
None of which should be fatal.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.414
Iron in the blood. Anaemia.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.184
Thousands of people
have these conditions.

13:07.249 --> 13:10.312
Yes, but not together.
Devlin did everything...

13:10.355 --> 13:11.795
Not enough.

13:12.408 --> 13:14.807
He is supposed to be the best.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.514
But did he do his best? No.

13:16.668 --> 13:19.665
And what took him so long to
order a course of phlebotomies?

13:19.749 --> 13:21.498
Or chemo, I don't know.

13:24.915 --> 13:26.434
You stuck together, you and him.

13:26.842 --> 13:29.723
You let him get away with
killing my wife. Admit it.

13:29.748 --> 13:32.388
It... wasn't... like... that.

13:33.382 --> 13:34.915
I'm sorry, Tom.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.293
But Devlin was right.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.348
Bullshit.

13:41.175 --> 13:43.095
That's bullshit.

14:00.429 --> 14:01.622
OK, Simon, what do you know?

14:01.676 --> 14:03.069
I don't know what I know.

14:03.094 --> 14:04.649
OK, well, what do you think?

14:06.122 --> 14:08.361
Alright, well, do you want
to know what I'm thinking?

14:08.876 --> 14:12.118
I'm thinking about all
the things that he did

14:12.209 --> 14:13.445
from the very beginning.

14:13.676 --> 14:15.952
When those bones first
came up from the river,

14:16.155 --> 14:18.043
he said that the bones
had been in the river

14:18.068 --> 14:20.307
for between two and four years.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.048
Maybe he was just wrong.

14:22.242 --> 14:24.281
When is he ever that wrong?

14:24.471 --> 14:26.896
Why couldn't we find a
match on Quinn's DNA?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.256
How hard did he try?

14:28.342 --> 14:30.159
Compared to any other case?

14:30.482 --> 14:32.642
You know again and
again all these steps,

14:32.667 --> 14:34.627
all these little roadblocks.

14:34.652 --> 14:36.571
I just accepted them.

14:37.035 --> 14:38.487
You did too.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.088
Then you found Quinn's car.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.289
Harrow was at Turbot Street

14:43.314 --> 14:44.981
the night the car went into the dam.

14:49.469 --> 14:50.869
What?

14:51.976 --> 14:53.583
OK, look, the servers went out

14:53.608 --> 14:55.021
in the early hours of the fourth.

14:56.821 --> 14:59.316
I checked Harrow's
work diary on the third.

15:00.341 --> 15:02.335
Harrow didn't do any work on the third.

15:02.461 --> 15:04.431
And I know all about
Quinn's wedding band,

15:04.456 --> 15:05.816
that Steph got it back.

15:06.562 --> 15:09.073
Except she thinks she got it back
after Quinn's car was dumped,

15:09.122 --> 15:11.030
two whole days after.

15:13.409 --> 15:15.768
There's an antique
surgeon kit in there.

15:18.749 --> 15:21.612
I want to know if the set of
shears matches the finger bones.

15:33.216 --> 15:35.615
What if they're missing?
-He dumped them?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.228
Yeah, and what if they're not a match?

15:37.302 --> 15:39.135
Then we were wrong.

15:39.328 --> 15:40.768
How great would that be?

15:42.402 --> 15:43.762
I have a key.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.815
Me too.

15:46.868 --> 15:48.387
OK, wait, wait, wait.

15:48.476 --> 15:49.955
It shouldn't be us.

15:50.056 --> 15:52.175
If this is going to happen,
we should do it properly.

15:52.207 --> 15:53.651
You said you spoke to
Nichols. What does he say?

15:53.675 --> 15:55.794
He said we needed something more.

15:55.936 --> 15:57.559
OK, more. More, like what?

15:59.461 --> 16:02.444
Why could we never find the
file on Quinn's orthotic plate?

16:05.315 --> 16:07.955
You and Harrow went to
the hospital archives and...

16:10.021 --> 16:11.742
Wait here.

16:23.835 --> 16:25.175
Tom.

16:26.315 --> 16:28.087
I'm sorry about your wife.

16:29.533 --> 16:33.591
But Devlin was thorough and methodical.

16:33.823 --> 16:38.284
Katie just had two
unfortunate genetic timebombs.

16:38.592 --> 16:43.271
If she had one or the other,
she would have lived, but both?

16:43.707 --> 16:45.854
It was just the hand
that she was dealt.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.308
She died, but you don't have to.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.502
Stay there.

16:50.082 --> 16:51.202
No.

16:51.297 --> 16:53.567
You have to let me pass you
so I can get you some help.

16:53.592 --> 16:55.045
Stay back. Stay back.

16:55.136 --> 16:56.336
Argh.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.968
Tom.
-Argh.

17:11.816 --> 17:13.535
Hang in there, Tom.

17:15.821 --> 17:17.102
Hang in there.

17:25.974 --> 17:27.969
I'm going to get some help.

17:42.309 --> 17:43.909
Hey, Dan, it's me.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.735
Simon was just here asking
about Robert's wedding band.

17:48.149 --> 17:49.804
Dad, Simon and your girlfriend,

17:49.828 --> 17:50.832
are on the Bettie.

17:50.857 --> 17:53.616
They're arguing and it
looks really serious.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.274
I'm at the Bettie.

17:57.428 --> 17:59.856
You really need to tell
me about Robert Quinn.

18:06.256 --> 18:07.815
Tom. Tom.

18:08.622 --> 18:10.622
Stay with me, Tom.

18:13.162 --> 18:14.542
Ambulance.

18:57.142 --> 18:58.989
You ever seen anything
like this before?

18:59.122 --> 19:01.002
Someone coming back from the dead?

19:01.202 --> 19:03.885
No, I did read an interesting
published account

19:03.910 --> 19:06.425
but it lacked the immediacy
of the real thing.

19:06.868 --> 19:09.203
So, can we sit down, get a statement?

19:09.490 --> 19:12.128
Do you mind if I just
finish cleaning myself up?

19:12.222 --> 19:14.862
Sure.
-Thank you.

20:13.649 --> 20:15.275
I threw them away.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.481
Well, dropped them, anyway.

20:23.675 --> 20:27.124
Upstream, in the river.

20:27.569 --> 20:29.184
Why?
-You know why,

20:29.209 --> 20:30.563
or you wouldn't be here.

20:32.185 --> 20:34.411
I should have got rid of the lot.

20:35.002 --> 20:36.561
Jack gave them to you.

20:39.736 --> 20:41.255
And Soroya?

20:41.429 --> 20:43.309
I don't know where she is.

20:45.256 --> 20:47.460
Mrs Whittemore?

20:48.001 --> 20:49.699
You're one of the police officers

20:49.731 --> 20:51.182
who came here looking for...

20:51.216 --> 20:52.815
whatever you were looking for.

20:53.229 --> 20:54.439
Did you find it?

20:54.679 --> 20:57.735
No, but I need to know
if someone else did.

21:06.489 --> 21:07.969
Did you kill Robert Quinn?

21:10.442 --> 21:11.762
Yes.

21:13.142 --> 21:14.222
Why?

21:15.415 --> 21:17.069
Because he hurt Steph?

21:18.661 --> 21:20.429
No.
-Then why,

21:20.454 --> 21:21.825
because he stole her from you?

21:21.862 --> 21:23.462
No, no, no.

21:26.489 --> 21:29.349
You know, for a while
I was happy for them.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.302
For Steph, especially.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.096
It was good to see her smile again.

21:37.462 --> 21:42.453
And for a while, she and he
and Fern all seemed happy.

21:43.422 --> 21:45.080
And I got on with my life.

21:49.536 --> 21:51.055
So what happened?

21:51.219 --> 21:52.799
A couple of years later,

21:52.859 --> 21:55.630
you remember Fern went off
the rails, left home?

21:55.696 --> 21:58.239
We thought it was a phase. It wasn't.

22:00.462 --> 22:04.521
But about a year ago, Fern called me.

22:05.148 --> 22:06.507
And she wanted to catch up.

22:07.058 --> 22:08.358
I was so excited.

22:08.382 --> 22:10.764
I got there about an hour early.

22:12.322 --> 22:13.882
And then I saw it.

22:32.348 --> 22:34.268
Suddenly, it all made sense.

22:35.275 --> 22:37.151
I could have done a number of things.

22:37.176 --> 22:38.535
I could have called Steph.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.712
I could have called Nichols.

22:39.737 --> 22:42.607
I could have waited until I had
a chance to speak to Fern.

22:43.035 --> 22:46.226
Instead, I decided
to ask Quinn himself.

22:47.468 --> 22:49.268
I used a payphone up the road.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.137
Asked him to come for a visit.

22:51.245 --> 22:53.135
I kept it light and breezy.

22:53.275 --> 22:55.635
Why did you use the payphone?

22:56.567 --> 22:59.024
Had you already decided
you were going to kill him?

23:05.502 --> 23:06.622
No.

23:08.736 --> 23:10.055
Though...

23:10.701 --> 23:14.124
part of me might have been
thinking what he'd say.

23:16.422 --> 23:17.967
What I'd do.

23:19.129 --> 23:22.261
And then I heard him
knock and I said...

23:24.248 --> 23:25.548
Come in, Robert.

23:28.382 --> 23:29.981
And I said, "Drink?"

23:30.136 --> 23:31.488
And he said...

23:31.701 --> 23:33.816
Only if it's your good stuff.

23:39.016 --> 23:40.736
So, this is where you live.

23:43.416 --> 23:46.295
I suppose I'll have to get
something like this for me too.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.370
Now that Steph has kicked us both out.

23:48.429 --> 23:51.709
The only difference is I bought
the Bettie with my own money.

23:55.815 --> 23:57.495
So that's what this is about.

23:59.736 --> 24:02.215
Being hauled into the
headmaster's office

24:02.302 --> 24:03.929
for a talking to about something

24:03.954 --> 24:06.240
that's really none of your business.

24:07.588 --> 24:09.482
I saw you with Fern today.

24:14.096 --> 24:15.655
You were arguing.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.068
On Water Street.

24:18.615 --> 24:20.067
What was that about?

24:23.715 --> 24:25.701
A watch of mine has gone missing.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.632
And you know what she's like, so...

24:29.075 --> 24:30.954
I figured she'd took
it to hock it or...

24:30.995 --> 24:32.235
Bullshit.

24:33.735 --> 24:35.541
Don't go calling me a liar, Dan.

24:35.639 --> 24:37.158
She was terrified of you.

24:37.321 --> 24:39.116
That wasn't about any watch.

24:49.022 --> 24:50.989
That's what this has
been about, isn't it?

24:52.502 --> 24:55.941
Her grades falling,
her quitting school,

24:56.002 --> 24:57.921
her leaving home, her...

24:58.096 --> 24:59.496
silence.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.001
It's because she's terrified of you.

25:03.441 --> 25:05.401
You should let this whole idea go.

25:07.108 --> 25:08.708
But you won't, will you?

25:09.462 --> 25:12.235
No. Not now.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.895
What did you do to her?

25:18.029 --> 25:20.363
Why don't you ask what she did to me?

25:20.759 --> 25:25.814
Why don't you ask about the time
that she invited me swimming

25:25.908 --> 25:27.427
when her Mum was out?

25:27.876 --> 25:30.911
Or about the time she
walked into my office

25:31.769 --> 25:35.408
pretending to have trouble
putting her necklace on?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.913
Or about the time when she
accidentally walked in on me

25:38.952 --> 25:40.553
when I was showering...
-I don't believe it.

25:40.608 --> 25:42.727
Come on, Dan. She's a smart girl.

25:43.263 --> 25:46.034
And she's so grown up.
She knew what she wanted.

25:46.102 --> 25:49.139
Don't you dare blame her.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.376
She was a child.

25:54.481 --> 25:56.037
You molested her.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.469
You abused my little girl.

25:58.494 --> 26:00.236
How the fuck was it abuse?

26:01.295 --> 26:05.015
She knew what she was doing. She knew.

26:06.662 --> 26:08.751
And I knew she didn't want it to stop.

26:21.262 --> 26:22.708
When did it end?

26:22.989 --> 26:24.535
She turned 15.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.468
Got a boyfriend, or...

26:27.493 --> 26:30.744
or... realised what we were doing was...

26:31.887 --> 26:35.224
Anyway, she said that
she was going to tell,

26:35.315 --> 26:40.074
and I had to explain
to her that ex-coppers

26:40.122 --> 26:42.555
don't really thrive in
the corrections system.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.722
Nor do paedophiles.

26:46.095 --> 26:50.046
So you threatened her?
-No, no, no. I didn't threaten her.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.618
I simply told her...

26:55.075 --> 26:57.085
that if she did tell anyone...

26:58.368 --> 27:00.768
that I would cut her mother's
throat in front of her.

27:03.629 --> 27:05.869
And then I would cut hers.

27:09.489 --> 27:11.409
I think that's why she left home.

27:14.349 --> 27:15.949
Always looking after her mum.

27:18.509 --> 27:19.869
Such a good kid.

27:22.169 --> 27:23.944
You know you shouldn't
have told me this.

27:24.026 --> 27:27.531
It doesn't matter, Dan, 'cause
you're not going to tell anyone.

27:28.016 --> 27:29.932
And don't worry about Steph and Fern.

27:30.308 --> 27:32.006
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

27:39.056 --> 27:41.496
You're a slippery bastard
now, aren't you?

28:11.016 --> 28:12.536
Argh.

28:19.896 --> 28:21.456
Argh.

28:55.315 --> 28:57.154
Stop.
-No.

28:57.588 --> 28:59.187
You didn't stop, did you?

28:59.284 --> 29:01.017
You should never have touched her.

29:01.082 --> 29:02.844
She was just a child.

29:23.296 --> 29:25.215
You could have called triple zero.

29:25.302 --> 29:27.662
You could have told them what he did.

29:30.635 --> 29:31.874
I know.

29:31.928 --> 29:34.487
You could have claimed self-defence.

29:34.829 --> 29:36.316
I know.

29:36.484 --> 29:37.885
You might not have gone to jail.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.481
It might not even have gone to trial.

29:39.535 --> 29:40.775
I know.

29:43.842 --> 29:45.282
But maybe it would have.

29:47.595 --> 29:49.826
And now I knew Fern's secret.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.804
Her hurt.

29:53.309 --> 29:55.507
And I wanted to be there for her.

29:55.709 --> 29:59.182
I couldn't face the
chance of being in jail,

29:59.673 --> 30:01.728
if she needed me whenever she was...

30:04.635 --> 30:06.595
whenever she was ready.

30:08.295 --> 30:11.903
I wanted to be there for her...

30:13.316 --> 30:15.036
so I got to work.

30:43.169 --> 30:45.683
I knew of a construction site upriver

30:45.708 --> 30:48.272
so I got the cement I needed.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.723
And I knew a spot where
it was very unlikely

30:50.762 --> 30:52.663
that any anchor would snag it.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.362
I don't know what made me
cut off his wedding ring.

30:58.869 --> 31:00.589
I just figured he didn't deserve it.

31:26.296 --> 31:28.475
I got rid of his car.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.842
I cleaned up here.

31:30.989 --> 31:34.610
I went to work, created an alibi and...

31:35.389 --> 31:36.753
then it was done.

31:41.586 --> 31:43.750
Please don't look at me like that.

31:44.242 --> 31:45.276
I haven't changed.

31:45.301 --> 31:46.700
I'm still the same person.

31:52.502 --> 31:53.982
Not to me.

32:00.402 --> 32:01.922
Well, I'm not sorry I did it.

32:03.893 --> 32:05.920
I'd do it all over again.

32:06.526 --> 32:08.692
The only thing I'm sorry about

32:09.050 --> 32:11.664
is lying to Soroya and lying to you.

32:14.609 --> 32:16.329
I'm so glad I don't have to anymore.

32:21.216 --> 32:22.616
Right.

32:26.375 --> 32:31.095
Well, I've just got a few
things I need to do.

32:31.707 --> 32:36.347
And, you should do
what you've got to do.

32:46.315 --> 32:49.655
Harrow visited the surgeon's
widow. He left with a file.

32:49.755 --> 32:52.116
He knew it would identify
the orthotic plate

32:52.141 --> 32:53.421
found in the river bones as Quinn's.

32:53.446 --> 32:54.645
No, I don't know where he is.

32:54.669 --> 32:56.148
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming in now.

32:56.495 --> 32:58.081
Hey, I've got to go into QIFM.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.890
There's been some incident with Harrow.

33:01.809 --> 33:03.608
Sergeant Dass?

33:04.126 --> 33:05.695
What's going on, Bryan?

33:06.030 --> 33:07.230
Yeah, Nichols here.

33:07.255 --> 33:09.383
Put me through to Superintendent Khan.

33:09.408 --> 33:11.196
I want to organise a search warrant.

33:12.518 --> 33:13.546
Daniel,

33:13.570 --> 33:15.038
I've just had a call from CIB.

33:15.115 --> 33:17.656
Apparently you've left QIFM unattended.

33:18.169 --> 33:19.609
Dad, where are you?

33:19.656 --> 33:21.655
I'm really worried... for you.

33:21.811 --> 33:24.865
I don't know what's going on.
I'm outside your work, OK?

33:24.932 --> 33:28.055
At the back. Just...
I'll... I'll wait here.

33:28.335 --> 33:30.556
Everything in his office,
including his computer.

33:30.581 --> 33:31.935
Bryan...

33:31.983 --> 33:33.375
Bryan.

33:33.423 --> 33:35.689
You've known Daniel
Harrow as long as I have.

33:35.775 --> 33:37.630
And you've been in this game
as long as I have, Max,

33:37.655 --> 33:41.043
and you know very well that
normal can do abnormal.

33:41.068 --> 33:43.187
Yeah, but Daniel is not normal.

33:43.212 --> 33:44.372
No, he's not.

33:44.449 --> 33:46.781
Maybe that's why he got
away with it for this long.

33:47.101 --> 33:49.775
You know, I would trust
him with my life.

33:50.156 --> 33:53.095
Do you really believe
he'd kill someone?

33:53.235 --> 33:54.995
I really need to find out.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.728
Sarge?

34:23.009 --> 34:24.168
Fern.

34:33.495 --> 34:35.677
Harrow. Harrow.

34:36.016 --> 34:38.695
Stay right there, please.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.871
Let's see your hands,
if you don't mind.

34:41.072 --> 34:42.655
Hands, Harrow.

34:42.822 --> 34:44.462
Let's see your hands, Harrow.

34:47.437 --> 34:49.357
Before I ask you any questions,

34:50.237 --> 34:53.677
I must tell you you have the
right to remain silent.

34:54.808 --> 34:56.206
Daniel.
-Hey, it's OK.

34:56.472 --> 34:58.135
That means you do not
have to say anything,

34:58.240 --> 35:00.366
make any statement or
answer any questions

35:00.415 --> 35:02.000
unless you wish to do so.

35:24.602 --> 35:26.402
I imagine you have a few questions.

35:29.016 --> 35:31.815
Why did you do it?
-Save it for the interview, Sergeant.

35:34.355 --> 35:35.555
Detective Leichhardt.

35:35.832 --> 35:39.261
Sarge, I'm looking at Dr Harrow's
pathology work register.

35:39.514 --> 35:41.709
No entries on October 3rd.

35:42.002 --> 35:44.688
Not a single autopsy processed.

35:45.902 --> 35:47.141
A few weeks ago,

35:47.166 --> 35:49.685
you visited the house of
Dr Anthony Whittemore.

35:49.910 --> 35:50.955
Why?

35:51.003 --> 35:53.361
Jack Twine was a friend
of the Whittemores.

35:53.711 --> 35:56.535
I thought Milly should
know that he was ill.

35:56.909 --> 35:58.304
Did you know he was the surgeon

35:58.329 --> 36:00.874
who put that bone plate
in Quinn's wrist?

36:01.495 --> 36:02.815
That makes sense.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.098
Did you remove Quinn's file?

36:06.496 --> 36:08.911
You make me sound very clever, Bryan.

36:20.322 --> 36:22.242
We can wait for the
warrant, if you like.

36:37.152 --> 36:42.143
Hi, Maxine. Er, this
parcel came for Harrow.

36:42.168 --> 36:44.597
Thank you. Did you find Simon?

36:44.622 --> 36:47.876
No, but I left a voicemail, so...

37:05.828 --> 37:07.868
How can I help you, Bryan?

37:10.048 --> 37:11.328
Is this yours?

37:13.168 --> 37:14.168
Yes.

37:14.456 --> 37:16.165
Pull it down, please.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.714
Have you had a look inside?

37:22.789 --> 37:24.548
We saw the security footage at Monte's

37:24.595 --> 37:26.355
when Fern tried to sell it.

37:37.276 --> 37:38.935
Can you open the box, please?

38:08.055 --> 38:10.495
I don't think you're
going to need that.

38:10.662 --> 38:12.022
Let's have a look, please.

38:34.902 --> 38:38.995
That's not even bloody close,
is it? There's no serration.

38:40.489 --> 38:42.088
They didn't cut that bone.

38:48.715 --> 38:50.008
Leichhardt?

38:50.258 --> 38:53.917
Sorry, Sarge. Dr
Pavich would like a word.

38:54.864 --> 38:55.908
Bryan.

38:55.977 --> 38:57.345
I'm kind of busy, Max.

38:57.425 --> 38:59.152
We have a letter here for Harrow,

38:59.177 --> 39:01.079
amongst Jack Twine's belongings.

39:01.235 --> 39:04.395
It's dated October 4th last year.

39:05.588 --> 39:06.963
What does it say?

39:07.099 --> 39:09.883
It says, "Thank you so much
for spending the day with me"

39:09.908 --> 39:11.401
"at Turbot Street yesterday."

39:11.426 --> 39:12.586
"It was such a pleasure"

39:12.611 --> 39:13.824
"to go through the old place"

39:13.849 --> 39:15.593
"one last time," etcetera, etcetera.

39:15.675 --> 39:16.715
4th of October?

39:16.796 --> 39:19.765
Yeah, so that's what Harrow
was doing on the 3rd of October.

39:19.790 --> 39:22.255
He was taking our old
boss through QIFM.

39:23.875 --> 39:25.562
Can you put Leichhardt back on?

39:25.869 --> 39:27.269
Say please.

39:28.122 --> 39:29.346
Please.

39:33.395 --> 39:35.095
Yeah, we phoned the old age home.

39:35.309 --> 39:36.802
Visitor log confirms that Jack Twine

39:36.827 --> 39:38.095
went out that day with Dr Harrow.

39:38.203 --> 39:40.787
Righto. Get a copy of that letter.

39:41.142 --> 39:42.502
Sure thing.

39:46.013 --> 39:47.701
Well, you might have
mentioned that, Harrow.

39:47.748 --> 39:49.375
Would have saved us a
little bit of trouble.

39:49.475 --> 39:52.475
I, I guess I forgot.

39:54.289 --> 39:56.129
Alright, let's clear out.

39:59.581 --> 40:02.211
We'll chat later, Sergeant.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.429
It's OK.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.716
I can't believe this.

40:23.307 --> 40:25.529
I can't believe any of this.

41:03.089 --> 41:06.455
What's going on? Fern
said you'd been arrested.

41:06.482 --> 41:08.302
Maxine's beside herself.

41:12.122 --> 41:13.768
Are you OK?

41:14.736 --> 41:16.576
It was just a misunderstanding.

41:20.456 --> 41:22.562
Do you know what happened to Robert?

41:24.195 --> 41:25.715
I wish I could tell you.

41:39.902 --> 41:42.462
You know, you should get
arrested more often.

41:42.656 --> 41:46.550
This room has not looked
this tidy in years.

41:46.656 --> 41:48.110
I'm surprised Fairly hasn't moved in.

41:48.135 --> 41:49.654
Why do you think I'm here?

41:49.976 --> 41:52.597
Stop him sneaking in and laying claim.

41:53.336 --> 41:58.351
You know, I got him to finish
the autopsy on Bill Devlin.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.655
He was a good haematologist.

42:00.803 --> 42:01.895
And Tom?

42:02.003 --> 42:03.210
Intensive care.

42:03.377 --> 42:04.770
If he lives,

42:05.269 --> 42:08.575
I guess you saved his life
to spend it behind bars.

42:14.769 --> 42:16.089
Are you OK?

42:17.016 --> 42:19.482
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

42:19.776 --> 42:23.932
And you?
-I'm not a happy camper.

42:24.252 --> 42:26.202
Simon's meant to be on call.
I don't know where he is.

42:26.242 --> 42:28.655
You turn up and all hell breaks loose.

42:28.702 --> 42:33.178
I have a $3,000 glass door
to deal with, and I...

42:34.689 --> 42:38.168
I'm furious with Bryan.

42:38.477 --> 42:39.855
He was just doing his job.

42:40.075 --> 42:41.798
And Dass?

42:42.549 --> 42:44.367
Don't be mad at her, either.

42:46.442 --> 42:48.395
I had to open this.

42:48.728 --> 42:50.554
I figured if anyone had
anything worth drinking,

42:50.579 --> 42:52.632
it would be Jack.

42:54.996 --> 42:56.423
I'm glad that you did.

42:58.049 --> 43:00.636
I suppose he forgot to post that.

43:01.456 --> 43:05.296
Yes, I... I guess
he was getting old.

43:10.589 --> 43:11.722
To Jack.

43:11.823 --> 43:13.042
To Jack.

43:21.056 --> 43:24.456
You brought Fairly in on
a public holiday. Why?

43:25.897 --> 43:27.577
Have you decided about Geneva?

43:27.656 --> 43:29.615
I'm not going to Geneva.

43:29.896 --> 43:33.636
But?
-We will talk about that tomorrow.

43:43.827 --> 43:47.750
I see you're no longer in custody.

43:48.262 --> 43:49.422
No.

43:49.490 --> 43:53.364
Look, I-I'll tell you this now.
That has got to stop.

43:54.963 --> 43:57.068
When you're boss.

43:57.376 --> 43:59.109
When I'm boss.

43:59.562 --> 44:02.561
What, no amusing riposte?

44:02.902 --> 44:04.083
No.

44:04.955 --> 44:06.435
Not today.

44:07.519 --> 44:12.275
Well, I am sorry that
you can't do this.

44:12.876 --> 44:14.855
I know that you very
much would like to.

44:15.015 --> 44:16.556
He's in good hands.

44:18.167 --> 44:21.279
His nursing home doctor
was right to order the PM.

44:21.329 --> 44:25.241
I got his bloods back.
Oxycodone overdose.

44:25.515 --> 44:27.315
Enough to kill a horse.

44:29.162 --> 44:31.471
Must have been stockpiling pills.

44:32.856 --> 44:36.591
Look... why don't I give
you a minute with him and...

44:36.789 --> 44:39.317
I'll do the internals later.

45:13.235 --> 45:15.229
Pavich is looking for you.

45:20.169 --> 45:21.608
I've been out.

45:21.743 --> 45:23.691
There's a pair of shears

45:23.809 --> 45:26.968
in my Mathieu de Paris surgeon's kit.

45:27.136 --> 45:30.681
Those shears are by Coxeter of England,

45:31.089 --> 45:32.849
a complete mismatch.

45:34.983 --> 45:39.992
I know of only one complete
Coxeter kit in the country.

45:42.109 --> 45:44.257
The School of Anatomy.

46:05.169 --> 46:06.842
It's not complete anymore.

46:09.331 --> 46:12.965
You fool. You shouldn't
have interfered.

46:13.202 --> 46:14.521
You should have rung the police.

46:14.546 --> 46:15.865
You knew what was
the right thing to do.

46:15.923 --> 46:17.802
I did.

46:18.236 --> 46:20.204
You made your choice and so did I.

46:21.842 --> 46:24.442
I just wanted to know the
truth, and I found it.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.423
Isn't that what you always
taught me, to find out why?

46:28.576 --> 46:31.567
But now you've gambled with your
career and you shouldn't have.

46:31.689 --> 46:33.820
You're too good a pathologist.

46:33.979 --> 46:35.888
Say that again.

46:36.835 --> 46:39.314
You're too good a pathologist.

46:45.822 --> 46:47.542
And now we're in it together.

46:52.515 --> 46:54.275
So don't lie to me again.

47:23.002 --> 47:25.862
It was you, wasn't it?

47:33.242 --> 47:34.602
I wanted to tell you.

47:36.396 --> 47:38.436
I wanted to tell you everything.

47:40.422 --> 47:43.256
I wanted to tell you
I know what he did.

47:45.648 --> 47:47.550
You should have told someone.

47:49.205 --> 47:50.825
I was so scared.

47:50.852 --> 47:52.198
You should have told someone.

47:52.256 --> 47:53.784
I was so scared.

47:54.915 --> 47:56.715
He said he'd hurt Mum.

47:58.309 --> 47:59.949
And I knew he would.

48:01.949 --> 48:05.023
I'm... I'm so sorry about everything.

48:05.088 --> 48:09.324
No, no. None of this was your fault.

48:09.355 --> 48:10.828
None of it.

48:18.249 --> 48:19.769
Does Mum know?

48:22.197 --> 48:24.061
What should I do, Dad?

48:24.135 --> 48:25.695
Whatever you want.

48:27.183 --> 48:29.183
Whatever you choose...

48:31.442 --> 48:32.822
I'll be here.

48:41.209 --> 48:42.649
Bora Bora?

48:43.262 --> 48:44.702
No.

48:46.256 --> 48:47.910
Not tonight.

49:08.349 --> 49:09.648
I love you, bub.

49:09.742 --> 49:11.302
Bye, Dad.

49:42.915 --> 49:44.275
Hi.

49:45.902 --> 49:49.476
Hi. You OK?

49:49.976 --> 49:51.736
No.

49:54.469 --> 49:55.909
You want to come over?

49:58.149 --> 49:59.549
I don't think I can.

50:01.249 --> 50:02.870
Goodbye, Daniel.
