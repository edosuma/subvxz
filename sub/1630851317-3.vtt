<i>Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...</i>

00:03.786 --> 00:05.831
Nigeria will be good for you.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.443
I will miss you.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.488
You have the best
of both worlds.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.491
Six months with your father,
and six months with me.

00:13.535 --> 00:18.844
♪ Yeah, and if you tell me
say make I bend low ♪

00:18.888 --> 00:21.804
♪ I no go waste time,
but to do like so... ♪

00:21.847 --> 00:24.285
This is so much better
than my first wedding.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.939
Mine, too.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.429
Did we just lose power?

00:38.473 --> 00:40.692
Welcome to Nigeria, Bob.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.131
Up Nepa!

00:57.187 --> 00:59.320
Eh-eh! Why are we going
through downtown?

00:59.363 --> 01:01.017
Listen well well.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.150
You should be on I-94.
No <i>wahala.</i>

01:03.193 --> 01:04.803
What?

01:04.847 --> 01:06.327
Stick to 94.

01:06.370 --> 01:09.547
"Johnny Just-Come" over here.

01:09.591 --> 01:11.680
I see my country has
rubbed off on you.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.421
It's my new favorite place.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.031
It's where I married the love
of my life, and I found out

01:15.075 --> 01:17.990
I could wear the hell
out of a dashiki.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.905
It does suit you.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.473
You know, the wedding was
not how we planned it,

01:22.517 --> 01:25.433
- but it was still perfect.
- Mm.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.740
I think your dad liked me.
He even hugged me goodbye.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.440
That is one more hug
than I have ever gotten.

01:32.483 --> 01:33.919
Come on.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.182
My mother said,
when I was born,

01:35.225 --> 01:36.357
he shook my hand.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.232
I am so tired, I just
want to go to sleep.

01:42.276 --> 01:45.148
The best part of every trip is
getting home to your own bed.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.759
My own bed.

01:47.803 --> 01:50.806
Nice and firm,
help out my back.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.330
So soft I can sink into it.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.376
My light cotton sheets.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.205
My heavy, weighted blanket.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.989
Like sleeping on a cloud.

02:00.032 --> 02:04.733
Like sleeping in a cozy grave.

02:04.776 --> 02:08.432
You know, we have our whole
lives to sleep together.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.088
What are you saying?

02:12.132 --> 02:15.700
Abishola, my wife, would you
do me the honor of sleeping

02:15.744 --> 02:17.920
in your own bed tonight
so that I can sleep in mine

02:17.963 --> 02:20.575
and spread out
like a starfish?

02:20.618 --> 02:21.967
Oh, I will.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.013
I love you so much.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.450
Eh-eh, two stops,
Uncle.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.148
Uncle?

02:28.191 --> 02:31.455
You want me to call you
something else? 'Cause I will.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.352
<i>E karo,</i> Auntie and Uncle.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.224
- Did you spend the night here?
- Yes.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.313
- Without Bob?
- Yes.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.708
What did you do?

03:06.751 --> 03:09.058
- Was there a fight?
- Did you hit him?

03:09.101 --> 03:13.193
No. Bob and I just wanted to
spend the night in our own beds.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.804
<i>Oluwa mi o.</i> What will
the neighbors say?

03:15.847 --> 03:17.240
The neighbors will not know.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.068
They will when she tells them.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.853
Am I supposed to talk
about the weather?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.291
My niece's marriage is
falling apart.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.249
Abishola,

03:26.293 --> 03:29.644
you understand that
we care about you very much.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.123
I do.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.213
So know this comes from
a place of love.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.999
Leave this apartment
and never come back.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.567
Do not make us spend money
on changing the locks.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.745
It is just one night.
Maybe two. I slept so soundly.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.617
Call the locksmith.

03:51.448 --> 03:54.364
There's the happy couple.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.279
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.281
I'll warn you,
it's a lot different

03:58.325 --> 03:59.456
knowing you can't leave.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.197
Where should I put this?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.851
Anywhere you want.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.200
Okay.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.594
- How come she gets a lamp?
- What?

04:06.637 --> 04:08.248
When you forced me to move in,

04:08.291 --> 04:10.511
I wasn't allowed to bring any
personal effects.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.339
You didn't let her
bring anything?

04:12.382 --> 04:15.255
I let her move into my home.
I built you a gym!

04:15.298 --> 04:18.040
I didn't ask for that
torture chamber.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.694
Your torture chamber
is one room.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.348
Mine was my whole childhood.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.697
Give it a rest, will ya?!

04:22.740 --> 04:24.264
Please stop fighting.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.875
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, we're just talking.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.920
I'll let you two settle in.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.095
Honey, I'm so happy you're here.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.532
So am I.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.795
If you need me,
I'll be in my cell.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.493
My yard time is up.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.886
I'm the one in prison.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.236
I'll see you at dinner!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.759
- We're having steak!
- Again?!

04:42.804 --> 04:44.414
Let's get you unpacked.

04:52.422 --> 04:53.815
Here you go.

04:53.858 --> 04:57.079
"Welcome to
the Number Two Club"?

04:57.122 --> 05:00.909
Husband number two. Same as us.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.606
That is the card I signed?

05:02.650 --> 05:05.305
Yes. You got a dead husband
and a serious boyfriend.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.958
You're an honorary member.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.744
Do not put me in
your failure club.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.354
You two are divorced,

05:11.398 --> 05:14.314
while my dear husband was
tragically taken from me.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.838
"Dear husband"?
You hated him.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.101
But I suffered through it
to the end.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.842
Which is why I will be
going to heaven,

05:20.885 --> 05:24.585
while you both are... iffy.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.457
Well,
I'm happy for you.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.937
I am happy for me, too.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.026
I never thought I would
get married again.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.028
He wooed you with socks.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.466
What woman can resist that?

05:36.510 --> 05:38.512
And now we are building
a home together.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.124
Is there a prenup?
No.

05:42.167 --> 05:45.475
Then it really is your home.

05:53.048 --> 05:56.051
Doesn't get more domestic
than this, huh?

05:56.094 --> 05:57.487
Next we'll be getting a dog.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.836
We are not getting a dog.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.185
Never say never.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.448
Never.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.714
Here it is. This is
the couch I wanted.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.630
- Wow.
- I know.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.066
That's why we had to get here

06:11.109 --> 06:12.502
before someone else
snapped it up.

06:12.546 --> 06:16.158
Well, looks like
we beat the rush.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.333
Isn't it elegant?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.684
Sure.
That's one word for it.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.992
You have to move back.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.563
What do you think?

06:29.606 --> 06:32.870
I kinda feel like a toddler.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.132
You don't like it.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.873
No, it's not that
I don't like it.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.180
It's just maybe we could
look at something

06:38.223 --> 06:41.444
that's more
traditionally... sittable.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.929
Elegant.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.283
Stuck the landing!

06:55.284 --> 06:58.505
Hold on, what do we have here?

06:58.548 --> 07:00.681
Now, yours may be elegant,

07:00.724 --> 07:03.597
but this one has cupholders.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.471
I have always dreamt
of a couch like this.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.038
You know, when I was 23,

07:10.081 --> 07:12.257
I studied for a semester
in Morocco.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.303
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.826
I lived with two friends
over a café

07:15.870 --> 07:17.698
that had something similar.

07:17.741 --> 07:21.484
Okay, now,
somebody was thinkin'.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
Tell me more about that place.

07:23.312 --> 07:24.705
It was beautiful.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.707
The owners knew
I could not afford much,

07:26.750 --> 07:30.145
so they would let me sit with
one coffee for hours,

07:30.188 --> 07:32.539
just watching people.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.890
Ah...

07:35.933 --> 07:37.152
Bob!

07:37.195 --> 07:41.243
Coffee, Morocco.
I'm listening.

07:54.952 --> 07:58.521
The holes were not in this
wall when you moved in.

07:58.565 --> 08:01.611
That is where I hung the
picture of you and Auntie.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.919
I see.

08:04.962 --> 08:08.357
You never smoked, painted or
had a cat in here, correct?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.272
Uncle, you know I did not.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.535
Uh-huh.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.799
This is for you.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.584
My recipe for
ogbono soup.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.456
Ah. You said you would only give
this to me on your deathbed.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.458
No, I said after death,

08:22.502 --> 08:25.592
I would tell it
to you in a dream.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.072
But I want you to have it now.
So that you and Bob

08:28.116 --> 08:31.946
can enjoy a family meal
in your new home.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.557
You and Uncle have been
such a blessing.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.298
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't let

08:36.341 --> 08:37.821
Dele and I stay here.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.388
I cannot thank you enough.

08:39.431 --> 08:42.957
You do not have to.
We are your family.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.789
Here is your full
security deposit.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.181
Uncle, no... Eh...

08:50.225 --> 08:53.358
Let him do this.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.273
The wall damage
is superficial.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.493
And besides,
after I plaster over it,

08:57.537 --> 09:01.628
it will be like
you were never here.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.586
Thank you.

09:03.630 --> 09:06.763
You are a wonderful niece...

09:06.807 --> 09:09.070
and an even better tenant.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.686
All right, uh, let's
set it right there.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.515
Ah, this is a nice couch.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.344
I am sorry your wife is
making you get rid of it.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.651
Oh, no, she's not making me.
I wanted to shake things up.

09:24.694 --> 09:28.829
Oh, it was kind of her to
let you think it was your idea.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.178
It was my idea.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.006
Yes. And it was my idea

09:32.049 --> 09:33.921
to let my wife have both closets

09:33.964 --> 09:36.750
while I keep my clothes
under the stairs.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.839
Kofo, back me up here.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.710
I am sorry, Mr. Wheeler,
but I barely know anything

09:40.754 --> 09:42.451
about you and your wife.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.932
He is still upset we did not
get to attend your wedding.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.890
Again, I am sorry about that.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.588
No need to apologize.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.286
I am just one of your many
insignificant employees.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.855
Look, after we get the
place how we want it,

09:54.898 --> 09:55.943
we're gonna have a
little get-together

09:55.986 --> 09:57.248
for friends and family.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.381
Well, I hope your friends
and family

09:59.424 --> 10:01.209
have a wonderful time.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.385
No, you guys are invited.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.909
So just anyone can come.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.389
Listen, I want you two there.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565
It'll be a
housewarming/wedding party

10:09.609 --> 10:11.654
for all the folks who couldn't
make it to Lagos.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.395
So a lot of people
could not make it?

10:13.438 --> 10:17.051
Well, there was you guys,
and Gloria,

10:17.094 --> 10:18.400
Abishola's nurse friend.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.836
So she was not invited either?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.015
I'm not gonna insult you

10:25.059 --> 10:26.669
by beating around
the bush; she was.

10:29.237 --> 10:32.544
Perhaps that is one bush
you should have beaten around.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.902
Abishola and I
want to thank you all

10:41.945 --> 10:44.252
for coming to celebrate
our wedding.

10:44.295 --> 10:47.342
Yes, we are so happy to share
this wonderful occasion

10:47.385 --> 10:49.257
in our beautiful home.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.173
We thought it was very important
to have a party here in Detroit,

10:52.216 --> 10:54.610
especially for those of you
who couldn't make it to Nigeria.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.526
- Or were not invited.
- You're here now!

10:57.569 --> 11:02.444
Please, eat, drink, and
above all, do not spill.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.968
- I'd like to say something.
- Sure.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.623
What the hell happened
to your house?

11:12.193 --> 11:13.455
You are being rude.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.458
- Why don't you mingle?
- I cannot.

11:16.501 --> 11:21.332
I am being swallowed
by this Moroccan monster.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.856
I will do it.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.553
Okay...

11:31.168 --> 11:34.171
Okay, we will mingle from here.

11:37.044 --> 11:39.742
Douglas, you gotta
take your shoes off.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.483
Didn't you see the sign
by the front door?

11:41.526 --> 11:43.485
I didn't think that meant me.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.400
Take 'em off. They're not
messing around.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.185
I had to roll
my wheels over a wet towel.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.536
Well, I think we
did a great job here.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.842
Oh, did "we"?

11:52.886 --> 11:54.322
Yeah, we went out
furniture shopping,

11:54.365 --> 11:58.021
got poufs, rugs,
the whole shebang. Together.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.067
I love it. I feel
like I'm in

12:00.110 --> 12:02.591
a bustling marketplace
in Marrakesh.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.332
That's exactly what
we were going for.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.073
Ugh. "We."

12:16.561 --> 12:17.693
Where's the TV?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.825
She removed it,

12:18.868 --> 12:20.217
along with
Bob's testicles.

12:20.261 --> 12:23.220
- Oh! Oh, hey, Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.527
- How's it going over here?
- Wonderful.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.834
I love what you've
done with the place.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.009
Very masculine.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.662
I brought my swimsuit.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.839
We gonna crank up that hot tub
a little later?

12:32.882 --> 12:34.884
Gloria, it is a
cocktail party.

12:34.928 --> 12:40.020
Oh, you're right, a few more
of these, who needs a suit?

12:42.152 --> 12:44.154
I'd like to make a toast.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.465
Everyone, I'd like
to make a toast.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.208
Hello?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.262
Get back to the party.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.135
Dude, there's not even a TV
in there anymore. It's sad.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.919
I told Abishola to
make the place her own,

13:09.963 --> 13:11.529
and that's what she did.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.183
The fact that you don't
know how sad it is

13:13.227 --> 13:15.229
makes it even more sad.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.100
It's a small change
in order for Abishola

13:17.144 --> 13:18.145
to feel happy here.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.363
She's excited, Douglas.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.974
Do you ever see her excited?

13:21.017 --> 13:23.672
Okay, what about you?
Do you like how it looks?

13:23.715 --> 13:25.239
No, I hate it.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.981
All the furniture is either
too small or too big.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.765
Then why did you change it?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.245
Because I love my wife.

13:31.288 --> 13:32.855
Ugh.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.162
Douglas, there are more
important things in life

13:35.205 --> 13:37.599
than my happiness or my comfort.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.470
Okay, what about my
happiness and comfort?

13:39.514 --> 13:40.994
Where am I supposed to go
after a long day

13:41.037 --> 13:42.952
to unwind and relax?

13:43.953 --> 13:45.520
Your own house!

13:45.563 --> 13:47.522
It may come to that.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.482
So, is this your first
party in America?

13:51.526 --> 13:52.962
Yes, it is.

13:53.006 --> 13:56.531
Well, don't worry,
they are not all like this.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.796
- Here you go, love.
- Oh, thank you.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.190
Oh, we have not met.
I am Chukwuemeka.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.366
This is Morenike,
a cousin of Abishola's

14:05.409 --> 14:06.410
staying with her family.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
It is wonderful to meet you.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.457
You as well.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.111
Are you a student?
Yes.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.503
At Wayne State.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.114
I went to Wayne State.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.942
I am studying to become
a pharmacist.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.118
You are kidding.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.293
I am a pharmacist.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.947
It must be fate that we met.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.688
Yes, what are the odds
you would meet

14:23.732 --> 14:26.517
another failed doctor?

14:28.345 --> 14:31.392
Oh, I think you're supposed to
use a coaster for the glasses.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.526
No need.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.313
This is a lovely party.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.229
You don't get out much, do you?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.927
Where is Bob?
Where is everybody?

14:44.971 --> 14:49.323
Sweetheart, you know I love you,
but you threw a dud.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.324
A dud?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.803
No, don't listen to her.

14:51.847 --> 14:54.371
I'm so proud of you
for doing this.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.808
Usually you have
your walls up.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.246
You know, fortress Abishola.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.814
But today you let us
deep inside you.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.773
And I like it.

15:06.644 --> 15:11.388
Dud. D-U-D.

15:13.564 --> 15:16.002
♪ That home out
on the range... ♪

15:16.045 --> 15:18.743
I'd like to take you all on
a little trip to "La Grange."

15:18.787 --> 15:21.181
Rest in peace, Dusty Hill.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.661
Oh, here we go.
Now it's a party!

15:23.705 --> 15:26.534
- Beer?
- Right here.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.973
♪ How, how, how,♪ How, how, how

15:31.017 --> 15:32.888
♪ How, how, how!

15:32.932 --> 15:34.629
Uh-oh.

15:35.630 --> 15:38.372
Great party. I love what
you've done with the place.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.200
I'm gonna go check the
temperature on the hot tub.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.811
Have mercy on him.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.121
I'm sorry.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.907
Hey. Talk to me.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.735
This party is a disaster.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.084
No, it isn't.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.217
Yes, it is.
Everybody hates everything.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.740
I thought Auntie
would like the new chair.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.089
It's her favorite color.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.525
What makes you think
she doesn't?

16:01.569 --> 16:04.224
She said,
"I do not like that chair."

16:04.267 --> 16:07.140
- Well, do you like it?
- Yes.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.882
Well, then sorry, Auntie,
the chair stays.

16:10.926 --> 16:14.625
It is not just Auntie.
I threw a dud.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.801
Maybe I am the dud.

16:16.845 --> 16:21.023
Okay, first of all,
you didn't throw a dud.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.590
<i>We</i> threw a dud.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.461
You don't get to take
all the credit.

16:24.505 --> 16:28.683
You are right.
- The party was your idea.
- There you go.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.119
What's the point
in being married

16:30.163 --> 16:32.426
if you can't blame stuff
on your spouse?

16:32.469 --> 16:34.863
Forget about the party.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
When you walk in
the living room,

16:37.083 --> 16:39.172
does it feel like
our home?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.609
Yes.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.350
Then that's all that matters.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.309
I do want to
change one thing.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.094
What's that?

16:48.137 --> 16:50.574
I think we need a TV
in the living room.

16:50.618 --> 16:53.273
I love you so much.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.971
There you are!

16:56.015 --> 16:58.582
Abishola needs to change me
for the hot tub.

17:05.154 --> 17:09.115
There she is, the Eighth
Wonder of the World.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.378
Mr. Wheeler,
we cannot accept this.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.989
No, no. Come on. Seriously.
I want you to have this.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.818
You guys looked after the
company for me while I was gone,

17:16.861 --> 17:19.299
and you deserve to be rewarded
for your efforts.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.083
Go ahead, try it out.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.479
Oh, my.

17:25.522 --> 17:28.177
It's like a cloud is
embracing me from below.

17:29.526 --> 17:31.311
Furniture like this
helps me to understand

17:31.354 --> 17:33.139
how Americans have
become so lazy.

17:33.182 --> 17:37.186
Who would get up from this
to go to work?

17:37.230 --> 17:39.188
Right? Now check this out.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.061
Oh...

17:42.104 --> 17:44.019
Ah...

17:44.063 --> 17:46.543
God bless America.
