My fellow Americans, thank you

Tonight we're
launching an effort

00:54.001 --> 00:57.575
which holds the promise of
changing the course
of human history.

00:57.575 --> 01:01.081
There will be risks and
results take time.

01:01.081 --> 01:02.818
But I believe we can do it.

02:26.953 --> 02:30.828
[narrator]
I heard about a man who carries
his own coffin.

02:31.729 --> 02:34.000
He doesn't wear a watch.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.639
He decides what time it is.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.913
Nino, are you ready for dinner?

This is a stick-up, mofos,
put your hands in the air!

06:32.443 --> 06:34.715
We can either
do this the easy way...

06:35.249 --> 06:37.955
Or my way.

06:37.955 --> 06:40.326

Don't you all know who I am?

07:03.171 --> 07:05.977
-Who is that guy?
-You don't know,
that's, that's...

With the central planners in
full genocidal effect,

08:43.905 --> 08:46.244
this whole city man,
needs a hero,

the blight, the smack,
the crack, the gangs,

08:50.285 --> 08:53.024

Oh, you'll take it
out of your ass.

29:50.369 --> 29:52.440
-Thunderstruck!
-Whooping Crane!

29:55.313 --> 29:57.585
Super Mario Brothers!

29:57.585 --> 29:59.121
[laughing]

30:04.866 --> 30:06.268
[groaning in slow motion]

30:32.487 --> 30:34.926
Leprechaun style wins.

30:35.761 --> 30:37.363
[birds chirping]

30:37.363 --> 30:38.733
[both groan]

30:38.733 --> 30:40.369
Who sent you?

30:40.369 --> 30:44.444
[out of breath]
You're making a mistake.

30:44.444 --> 30:46.616
[panting] Big mistake.

30:46.616 --> 30:49.755
Mistake's the first word
my mama said to me.

30:49.755 --> 30:51.559
Now who sent you!

30:51.559 --> 30:55.233
[hip hop playing]

31:00.009 --> 31:02.413
[Paco] Hey, Willy. You don't
got a TV at home?

31:02.413 --> 31:04.519
Even my family in Mexico
got a TV.

31:04.519 --> 31:06.856
And I bet it took
all 15 of your brothers
and sisters

31:06.856 --> 31:09.194
to pay for it, too, Nacho.

31:09.194 --> 31:12.835
You see this?
They might as well
call it toilet paper.

31:12.835 --> 31:15.373
It ain't money.
It's a Fed note.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.343
And it says, "I owe you"!

31:17.343 --> 31:20.216
So you stick it! Garbage!

31:20.216 --> 31:23.355
[screaming and laughing]

31:23.355 --> 31:26.562
This is my living room here!
I'm living here, people!

31:26.562 --> 31:28.700
[hip hop playing]

31:49.575 --> 31:51.512
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

31:51.512 --> 31:52.848
-Yeah.
-Whoo.

31:52.848 --> 31:54.417
[Johnny Fang]
Here we go, baby.

31:56.522 --> 31:57.925
Looks like a dead end, baby.

31:59.962 --> 32:02.768
We got you dead to rights.

32:02.768 --> 32:04.739
The only way
you're walking out of here

32:04.739 --> 32:06.274
is with the walking dead.

32:06.642 --> 32:08.312
Yeah.

32:08.312 --> 32:09.882
Aw, you must be tired.

32:09.882 --> 32:14.558
Let me guess,
I've been running
through your head all day.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.794
How'd you know that?

32:15.794 --> 32:18.032
So where's Superfly
to save your skinny ass?

32:18.032 --> 32:19.668
I don't need no Superfly

32:19.668 --> 32:21.606
to save my ass from you,
Ponyboy.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.908
[all] Ohh!

32:22.908 --> 32:25.947
Okay, whoa! Here's the deal!

32:25.947 --> 32:29.955
You can join our gang,
and serve me

32:29.955 --> 32:33.462
-on both knees.
-[all laughing]

32:36.669 --> 32:39.642
Oh, on your broken knees?

32:40.811 --> 32:44.685
Whoa. Whoo. What?
What did she say?

32:46.956 --> 32:49.795
You look like
the Boys of Summer.

32:49.795 --> 32:51.431
Too bad summer's over.

32:52.701 --> 32:54.337
Keep walking...

32:56.475 --> 32:58.780
if you want to
keep that look,
pretty boy.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.120
You know something funny?

33:02.120 --> 33:04.625
I used to fuck
guys like you in prison.

33:04.625 --> 33:07.531
[laughs]

33:07.531 --> 33:09.635
What were you
in the slammer for?

33:09.635 --> 33:11.739
Playing my guitar too loud!

33:11.739 --> 33:13.843
[grunting]

33:27.671 --> 33:31.411
[grunts]

33:31.411 --> 33:32.848
Better call the dentist.

33:34.484 --> 33:36.956
[whimpering]

33:38.392 --> 33:39.695
[The Fist] Drop 'em.

33:42.868 --> 33:43.970
[groans]

33:44.738 --> 33:46.776
Where you going, runaway?

33:46.776 --> 33:49.113
Looks like you're cruisin'
for a bruisin'.

33:49.113 --> 33:51.819
I'm looking for a She-Ra
to my He-Man.

33:51.819 --> 33:53.823
I'm pretty sure
She-Ra was his sister

33:53.823 --> 33:55.527
and He-Man is gay.

33:56.929 --> 33:59.635
Don't talk about He-Man
like that.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.471
Listen, you,
I'm a witch from hell,

34:01.471 --> 34:04.444
and you better not
forget it, creep.

34:04.444 --> 34:06.081
I come from hell.

34:06.081 --> 34:09.621
So when you go back,
tell Nicky, como estas?

34:09.621 --> 34:12.126
[El Guapo] Hey, Fist,
come on, man,
what you doing? Let's go.

34:12.126 --> 34:13.996
He's trying to bang something.

34:17.670 --> 34:19.875
Watch it,
don't step on his teeth.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.848
[narrator] When the
wanna-be gangster
Superfly got wasted,

34:22.848 --> 34:25.620
his two crazy-ass
white boy
bosses disrespected

34:25.620 --> 34:27.958
the Duck Suck Song dojo
looking to collect.

34:27.958 --> 34:29.995
After handing them
back their asses,

34:29.995 --> 34:32.634
Fist and friends
are on a retaliation train

34:32.634 --> 34:34.737
headed for
the next boss in line.

34:34.737 --> 34:36.742
'Cause you know what,
we all got one.

34:36.742 --> 34:41.851
Someone's gotta pay.
Someone always pays.

34:41.851 --> 34:44.190
[Willy] Service in this place
is terrible.

34:44.190 --> 34:45.893
Who picked this joint?

34:45.893 --> 34:47.463
So what's your name, kid?

34:48.031 --> 34:49.500
Ana.

34:51.539 --> 34:53.643
Ana Conda.

34:53.643 --> 34:56.549
I always wanted
to hunt an anaconda.

34:56.549 --> 34:58.653
See what it feels like
to get swallowed.

34:58.653 --> 35:00.557
I'd rather kill myself.

35:01.859 --> 35:03.228
Where you from?

35:03.228 --> 35:05.466
Wrong side of the tracks.

35:05.466 --> 35:08.071
That why you got
caught up with Superfly,

35:08.071 --> 35:10.109
trying to get even
with the game?

35:10.109 --> 35:12.514
He promised me a record deal.

35:12.514 --> 35:13.950
You sing the blues?

35:13.950 --> 35:17.824
No, I'm always happy!
[laughs]

35:17.824 --> 35:19.695
What's the 411?

35:19.695 --> 35:22.199
Aren't you, like, some sort
of has-been porn star?

35:22.199 --> 35:24.003
Why do you even
work at a bagel shop?

35:24.003 --> 35:25.807
I don't work
at a bagel shop.

35:25.807 --> 35:27.978
I'm waiting
for the night train.

35:27.978 --> 35:29.815
Night train to what?

35:29.815 --> 35:31.585
[The Fist]
To get my groove back.

35:31.585 --> 35:33.756
I think you might need
some silverware or something.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.794
[Willy] A fork, I need a fork.
[Willy's date] That's it.

35:35.794 --> 35:38.699
Waiter, bring me a fork.

35:38.699 --> 35:41.672
Chica, why you
dating this monkey?

35:41.672 --> 35:45.245
Monkey? [laughs] Oh, I always
wanted a monkey as a pet.

35:45.245 --> 35:47.483
-[Willy's date laughs]
-What?

35:47.483 --> 35:49.621
Did you know
that I'm Willy's date?

35:49.621 --> 35:55.132
Listen to me,
ju can pet my monkey anytime.

35:55.132 --> 35:57.771
-Oh, I can pet it?
-Anytime.

35:57.771 --> 35:59.741
Wow. [giggles]

35:59.741 --> 36:01.612
Are you really El Guapo?

36:01.612 --> 36:04.283
And is he really The Fist?
[laughs]

36:04.283 --> 36:06.989
Do you wanna know why
they call him The Fist?

36:06.989 --> 36:08.559
I've always wondered.

36:08.559 --> 36:12.601
Because he puts it
all the way in.

36:12.601 --> 36:16.007
Wow. That's crazy.
[giggles]

36:17.577 --> 36:21.484
I think Thunderfoot was right.
Chinese Boss is here.

36:23.488 --> 36:27.163
It smells like acrylic
and gold nail polish.

36:27.163 --> 36:29.066
[Willy] You know why gold
is so expensive?

36:29.066 --> 36:32.774
'Cause a dollar in gold
is always worth
a dollar in gold!

36:32.774 --> 36:35.847
[high-pitch voice] Sir.
You make too much noise.

36:35.847 --> 36:37.784
It's no good for business.

36:38.786 --> 36:41.124
Well, excuse me,
Ching-chong-chung.

36:42.627 --> 36:45.065
Last I heard
this is a free country.

36:45.065 --> 36:46.936
All except for
the Federal Reserve

36:46.936 --> 36:49.173
which has enslaved the people
since like 1917

36:49.173 --> 36:52.179
when Paul Warburg
pulled this bullshit
out on Jekyll Island

36:52.179 --> 36:54.317
and enslaved
the United States citizenry.

36:54.317 --> 36:56.855
All the people in America
are slaves.

36:56.855 --> 36:59.995
And now we don't even know
what a dollar is,

36:59.995 --> 37:02.667
it's just a worthless
piece of paper
with shit ink on it,

37:02.667 --> 37:04.337
and you can't even
buy a chopstick

37:04.337 --> 37:06.040
which, which will
poke your eye out

37:06.040 --> 37:08.980
because tuna's cud,
watching the world go by,

37:08.980 --> 37:12.887
while the Chinese come in here
and rape and pillage.

37:12.887 --> 37:15.827
They're planning on raping
for the next thousand years.

37:15.827 --> 37:17.998
It's like this whole
national debt thing,

37:17.998 --> 37:19.701
there's no such thing
as a national debt.

37:19.701 --> 37:22.607
It's a fraud.
It's a bunch of nonsense

37:22.607 --> 37:24.043
because it's worth nothing.

37:24.043 --> 37:27.917
And this is worth
as much as a fucking dollar!

37:27.917 --> 37:30.657
There's just
completely worthless shit.

37:31.759 --> 37:34.063
And we can do anything
we want! You understand?

37:34.063 --> 37:35.833
We are the
United States of America.

37:35.833 --> 37:37.570
We are the greatest
nation in the world!

37:37.570 --> 37:40.610
And you are a bunch
of Chinese-eating

37:40.610 --> 37:42.681
Long Duk Dong, plum sauce.

37:43.783 --> 37:46.054
You got these fake ducks,
rubber ducks,

37:46.054 --> 37:48.592
their fake dildos,
get these commies out of here!

37:48.592 --> 37:50.697
Next thing you know,
we'll have these commies

37:50.697 --> 37:54.070
selling their stuff
all over our biggest
stores in our country,

37:54.070 --> 37:57.610
enslaving the hard-working man!

37:57.610 --> 38:00.750
OJ wants some
Chinese spare ribs, Jack.

38:00.750 --> 38:02.687
-Chinese ribs?
-Yeah.

38:02.687 --> 38:04.190
I like 'em charred.

38:04.190 --> 38:09.100
[shouting] No ribs!
You go now. Now, go!

38:11.304 --> 38:15.011
No. I stay. You go!

38:16.615 --> 38:17.851
Take a seat.

38:17.851 --> 38:19.688
[all grunting]

38:36.053 --> 38:38.224
[dance music playing]

38:56.862 --> 38:58.833
[grunting]

39:07.082 --> 39:09.888
This is the worst date ever.

39:11.925 --> 39:13.061
[screams]

39:32.232 --> 39:34.871
[inaudible arguing]

40:08.338 --> 40:09.941
[cracking]

40:13.381 --> 40:15.418
[shouting]

40:17.322 --> 40:18.424
The fuck are you doing, boy?

40:29.246 --> 40:30.448
Jew Fu!

40:30.448 --> 40:31.852
Jew what?

40:36.995 --> 40:38.164
[The Fist] Ju on this.

40:42.005 --> 40:43.107
Boss.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.011
[grunts]

40:45.011 --> 40:47.449
Yeah. [grunting]

40:47.449 --> 40:50.422
Yeah!

40:50.422 --> 40:53.529
Everybody, take it easy.

40:53.529 --> 40:55.465
I'll take it
anyway I can get it.

40:59.073 --> 41:01.444
Wait. Ju the Chinese Boss?

41:03.014 --> 41:05.418
That's the last time
you call me a Jew.

41:05.418 --> 41:06.822
I'm Armenian!

41:06.822 --> 41:08.625
Ju da boss
at the bagel shop, too,
that's what I'm saying.

41:08.625 --> 41:09.961
-Ju the boss...
-Yeah, I saw, too.

41:09.961 --> 41:11.565
He runs both operations.

41:11.565 --> 41:13.367
He's the
Armenian mob's connection

41:13.367 --> 41:14.504
to the Chinese mafia.

41:14.504 --> 41:16.942
-Okay. Okay.
-What did you expect?

41:16.942 --> 41:18.311
Charlie Chan?

41:18.311 --> 41:21.150
Somebody's gotta pay
for the damage you did.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.319
Listen up, Boss,

41:22.319 --> 41:25.593
you got problems with me,
you can take it to the shop,

41:25.593 --> 41:27.195
the chop shop.

41:27.195 --> 41:29.901
Well, here's the deal.

41:29.901 --> 41:32.607
Your Scooby Gang
is not gonna interfere

41:32.607 --> 41:35.546
with my street racket anymore.

41:35.546 --> 41:36.948
Don't get upset, honey.

41:36.948 --> 41:38.519
You want a chair?

41:38.519 --> 41:40.455
I got one right here
that can fly.

41:40.455 --> 41:42.459
And it's powered
by a can of whoop ass.

41:42.459 --> 41:45.098
I'm the boss! What do you
think you're doing?

41:47.068 --> 41:50.543
[screams]

41:50.543 --> 41:53.114
[narrator] Whoo, you know,
sometimes, man,

41:53.114 --> 41:54.316
that spicy kung fu chicken

41:54.316 --> 41:56.253
can give you hot wings
to crush your boss

41:56.253 --> 41:57.289
like a Coke can.

41:57.289 --> 41:59.627
But even a boss is just
a dealer in this game.

41:59.627 --> 42:02.567
So Fist and his friends
gotta look further
down the supply chain

42:02.567 --> 42:04.537
if they're gonna find
the real gangsters
in this town.

42:04.537 --> 42:07.075
For real.
You know what I mean?

42:07.075 --> 42:09.246
Hey, man, what you doing
back there, be careful.

42:09.246 --> 42:10.315
This is the boss' car.

42:10.315 --> 42:12.085
Oh man, shut up, jack.

42:12.085 --> 42:15.325
Okinawa says that Fist
should've banged Willy's date!

42:15.325 --> 42:17.964
Man, this guy hasn't banged
anything since the '70s.

42:17.964 --> 42:19.499
Look at him. Ju know what,

42:19.499 --> 42:22.272
Okinawa, that's why ju gotta
keep your balls sharp.

42:22.272 --> 42:23.909
Okay, oh, look at this one!

42:23.909 --> 42:26.581
Hey, little lady! Ju wanna
ride my love machine?

42:26.581 --> 42:28.552
[honking] Okay.

42:28.552 --> 42:31.056
I got your machine, man.
What's up, man.

42:31.056 --> 42:32.325
Are you a cop?

42:32.325 --> 42:34.363
Are you a narc?
What you doing man?

42:34.363 --> 42:35.532
What do you mean
what am I doing here, man?

42:35.532 --> 42:37.637
You know I was coming.
I was supposed to be here, man.

42:37.637 --> 42:40.141
Hey, guess what?
Chinese restaurant closed.

42:40.141 --> 42:41.945
Which way to Brooklyn?

42:41.945 --> 42:45.084
Hey, man, Okinawa think
this man is fruity pebbles.

42:45.084 --> 42:47.155
I am Hong Kong 8.

42:47.155 --> 42:51.063
We the 8, the Hong Kong 8.
I'm on a rendezvous
with my group,

42:51.063 --> 42:53.669
the 55 Brooklyn Crew,
you understand?

42:53.669 --> 42:56.508
I don't know what you're

53:33.714 --> 53:37.120
and it pulls me in,
and it pulls me in.

53:37.120 --> 53:42.599
And Fist, this is for men.
Men. Man to man.

53:42.599 --> 53:48.644
You are the greatest porn star
the world has ever seen.

53:48.644 --> 53:51.082
And I wish every man
could be like you.

53:52.117 --> 53:54.021
If looks could kill.

53:57.829 --> 53:59.098
Yes.

54:02.004 --> 54:03.741
I'm just gonna watch.

[The Fist] Straight out
of a comic book.

54:20.941 --> 54:22.277
Hey, man, look.

54:22.277 --> 54:23.914
We got evicted
from our apartment.

54:23.914 --> 54:26.787
Su mi casa es su casa.
I love you, man.

54:26.787 --> 54:28.857
Dude, you got some food here
or something for us?

54:28.857 --> 54:31.763
[Willy] No, my refrigerator
broke so I threw it
out the window.

54:31.763 --> 54:34.268
Oh, man, you don't got
anything organic, vegetarian,

54:34.268 --> 54:36.940
something like pussy,
or vegetarian pussy,

54:36.940 --> 54:39.746
or cheapos, goat testicles?

54:39.746 --> 54:41.683
Ah, I got some bull balls.

54:41.683 --> 54:42.719
[knock at door]

54:42.719 --> 54:45.958
-That's protein. You want some?
-Blue balls.

54:45.958 --> 54:46.927
[Willy] Who the hell are you?

54:46.927 --> 54:49.766
I had dinner with you
last night, retard.

54:50.266 --> 54:51.903
Hi, Fist.

54:51.903 --> 54:53.741
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

54:53.741 --> 54:55.644
I brought you a doggybag.

54:55.644 --> 54:57.749
I promise in future
I won't be bad.

54:57.749 --> 54:59.017
[bell clanging]

54:59.017 --> 55:00.821
What, did your mother slap
some sense into you?

55:00.821 --> 55:02.892
I bet you don't
even have a mother.

55:02.892 --> 55:04.394
True story.

55:04.394 --> 55:08.637
Make sure that when you
take bites, they're big.

55:11.275 --> 55:13.079
Hey, okay, little lady.

55:13.079 --> 55:15.350
We gotta go now
because we got a mega fight

55:15.350 --> 55:17.087
with the Superboss
at the car wash.

55:17.087 --> 55:20.393
Right, Fist? So you gotta go,
little one. Okay?

55:20.393 --> 55:21.530
I'm not the little one.

55:21.530 --> 55:24.334
You're the little one
for hiding behind The Fist.

55:24.334 --> 55:29.344
Hey! I'm a political refugee
from Cuba, okay.

55:29.344 --> 55:32.284
And I want my human right like
the President Jimmy Carter says.

55:32.284 --> 55:34.656
Now you go. Peace be upon you.

55:34.656 --> 55:36.860

What a glorious day!

56:01.075 --> 56:03.112
What's the matter with this guy.

56:03.112 --> 56:06.987
This guy's acting like he banged
the Victoria Secret birds, man.

56:06.987 --> 56:09.926
Hey, he's got a nice smile.

56:09.926 --> 56:11.796
Fist, you shave
or something, man?

56:11.796 --> 56:13.800
The razor broke
before I could shave my chest.

56:15.370 --> 56:17.140
Guy's going a little cuckoo.

56:18.042 --> 56:20.981
Yeah, but he's got a nice smile.

57:37.367 --> 57:38.770
Okay, chica?

57:38.770 --> 57:41.341
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't catch that.

57:41.341 --> 57:42.812
But you know what,

57:42.812 --> 57:45.116
I think I detect
a Soviet accent?

57:45.116 --> 57:46.953
Oh, my gosh,
that's the first time

57:46.953 --> 57:49.024
a Russian has been in our store.

57:49.024 --> 57:50.226

about your car wash.

58:35.049 --> 58:38.322
More like a money wash
where you launder Fed Notes

58:38.322 --> 58:43.365
from making sales
of garbage meat, garbage meat

58:43.365 --> 58:45.938
to the hard-working
American man.

58:45.938 --> 58:47.473
I got your meat in my pants.

58:48.475 --> 58:50.614
You got nothing!

58:50.614 --> 58:55.456
Sleep, sleep, little boy. Okay.

-Name? What's your name?

58:59.431 --> 59:00.934
What's your name?

59:00.934 --> 59:02.972
-I asked you first.
-I asked you second.

59:02.972 --> 59:06.546

I hope everyone is having
a beautiful day.

59:28.122 --> 59:29.859
Are my friends too much
of a nuisance for you?

59:29.859 --> 59:32.297
No, no problem,
no problem, Fist.

59:32.297 --> 59:37.040
Now Superboss,
he wants to see your fist, Fist.

59:37.040 --> 59:38.409
Not as much
as I want to see him.

Not as much
as I want to see your fist.

Fantastic.

01:00:16.418 --> 01:00:18.288
I'm sorry if my Supervisor

01:00:18.288 --> 01:00:20.326
was a little rough
with your friends.

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:22.363
Not good.

01:00:22.363 --> 01:00:24.267
They were probably
asking for it.

01:00:24.267 --> 01:00:26.238
What my little friend
is trying to say is,

01:00:26.238 --> 01:00:27.508
we heard a rumor

01:00:27.508 --> 01:00:29.244
that you're selling

01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:32.250
meat pumped full of estrogen
to emasculate men.

reduction in male testosterone.

will become interchangeable,

I've been taking this
organic testosterone booster

01:01:28.428 --> 01:01:31.201
for years now, and I'm ready,

what I'm saying, Mean Gene?

01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:36.278
I'm ready to fight
your reptilian army!

01:01:36.278 --> 01:01:40.486

Would you like a discount
to our super saver plan?

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:54.113
I don't do discounts.

01:01:56.586 --> 01:01:58.523
Ah!

01:01:58.523 --> 01:02:01.127
Senorita, you sure
you don't want a discount?

[Superboss] I can't let you
go off

01:02:05.804 --> 01:02:09.277
and warn these half-men
about my operation.

01:02:09.277 --> 01:02:12.149
We need them slaving away
for the rest of their days.

01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:15.422
Give it 30 years.

01:02:15.422 --> 01:02:18.630
We'll be feeding them
genetically modified food,

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:21.101
and these idiots
will be eating it up.

01:02:22.169 --> 01:02:23.506
Slaves!

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:27.279
They keep the economy going

01:02:27.279 --> 01:02:29.150
in the hopes of one day

01:02:30.219 --> 01:02:32.289
finding a man-eating,

01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:37.500
ball busting, credit-swiping
witch for a wife.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.470
Witch?

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:42.811
Boy! I told you
not to call women witches.

01:02:42.811 --> 01:02:45.115
Mom!

01:02:45.115 --> 01:02:47.119
I'm right in the middle
of a final showdown here.

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:48.523
Have some respect, Marian...

01:02:48.523 --> 01:02:50.292
-Marian?
-Marian?

01:02:50.292 --> 01:02:54.133
That's a sissy-ass name, man.
You like a lady!

01:02:54.133 --> 01:02:55.704
-Shut up!
-Marian.

01:02:55.704 --> 01:02:58.710
Just shut up! You die right now.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.880
[laughing]

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.450
Who's this?

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:04.888
Hey, big boy. Take me.

01:03:04.888 --> 01:03:06.525
-Hey.
-I'm yours.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:08.796
Okay.

01:03:08.796 --> 01:03:10.834
Give it to me, daddy.
Give it to me.

01:03:14.608 --> 01:03:18.148
Mom! Mom! Mom!

01:03:20.553 --> 01:03:22.156
Mother!

01:03:22.156 --> 01:03:25.195
Look, I love you,
but will please just leave.

01:03:25.195 --> 01:03:26.866
This is still my car wash.
Mine.

01:03:26.866 --> 01:03:29.805
Okay, but remember he's mine.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.341
Sure.

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:32.711
Fine. Fine.

01:03:33.679 --> 01:03:34.815
Let's go.

01:03:38.388 --> 01:03:40.860
Okay, cut, cut,
this is not right.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.631
What did you do to The Fist!

01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:44.167
I did.

01:03:45.435 --> 01:03:46.639
I put enough estrogen

01:03:46.639 --> 01:03:49.912
in those camel-filled
sweaty hairy balls

01:03:49.912 --> 01:03:52.349
to grow you another tit.

01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:55.489
What does Fist need
a third tittie for?

01:03:55.489 --> 01:03:58.295
I told you, and I warned you
that I'm a witch from hell,

01:03:58.295 --> 01:04:00.365
and you didn't believe me!

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:02.671
Ju know what your problem is,
pussycat?

01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:05.777
Ju got nothing to do.

01:04:05.777 --> 01:04:08.716
Ju need a passion in life.
And a Quaalude.

01:04:08.716 --> 01:04:10.987
That's why I'd take
made in China

01:04:10.987 --> 01:04:13.593
over American crap any day.

01:04:13.593 --> 01:04:15.830
Don't make too much noise, boys,

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.299
I'm putting mama to bed,

01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:19.203
you know when you blow
their brains out.

01:04:20.573 --> 01:04:23.245
[singing in foreign language]

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.544
So this survey
says you're dead.

01:04:39.544 --> 01:04:42.817
In this world, there's right,
and there's wrong.

01:04:42.817 --> 01:04:46.692
And you. You're wrong.
Dead wrong.

01:04:46.692 --> 01:04:48.428
Got anything else to declare?

01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:51.467
[The Fist] You're damaged goods.

01:04:52.469 --> 01:04:54.240
[shrieking]

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.981
Have no fear, KGB is here!

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.427
[yelling]

01:05:08.034 --> 01:05:09.738
Gimme some of that DDT!

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:12.844
I'm ready!
I need to resent the reptilians.

01:05:22.429 --> 01:05:24.266
[upbeat music playing]

01:07:55.736 --> 01:07:57.573
[gagging]

01:08:05.723 --> 01:08:07.426
Have a super day.

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:10.933
[laughing]

01:08:21.755 --> 01:08:23.625
You got a nice smile.

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:25.127
And you do, too.

01:08:28.434 --> 01:08:30.037
Who's next!

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.478
[laughing]

01:08:35.983 --> 01:08:37.653
You know, I don't have
to do this today.

01:08:37.653 --> 01:08:39.390
I can come back tomorrow.

01:08:41.862 --> 01:08:43.665
Just tell me,
is it still screwed on?

01:08:47.072 --> 01:08:48.474
I'm out of lines.

01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:52.082
Ha, ha!

01:08:52.082 --> 01:08:53.886
Not so tough now, huh!

01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:54.988
[narrator] Now don't go
scratching your heads

01:08:54.988 --> 01:08:57.459
and shaking dandruff all over
the person next to you.

01:08:57.459 --> 01:08:59.162
Fist might look tough
as Swayze,

01:08:59.162 --> 01:09:02.169
but that Soylent Green GMO
estrogen he got slipped

01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:04.974
would have you feeling
like Tinker Bell, too.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.712
It's time for Fist to find
that tiger's eye he lost

01:09:07.712 --> 01:09:09.049
with his gold fleece jacket.

01:09:12.421 --> 01:09:13.792
[grunts]

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:15.930
Where has my gold gone?

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:18.501
Forged in the hearts of men,

01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:21.439
grown drunk
on the spoils of war.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:24.046
[Drunk Santa]
Shut that shit up.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:26.751
How we doing?

01:09:28.988 --> 01:09:31.627
Was it something,
I was off-key or something?

01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:32.930
Hey, listen up everybody.

01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.935
When the dragon sings,
everybody listen.

01:09:35.935 --> 01:09:37.072
[The Fist] Dragon?

01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:42.750
Dragons are meant to be wise.

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.854
Tell me,
where is my gold fleece?

01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:46.858
Dragon mist.

01:09:54.006 --> 01:09:55.241
Ain't you The Fist?

01:09:56.277 --> 01:09:58.247
[sighs] Used to be.

01:09:59.918 --> 01:10:01.888
When the world's
on your shoulders,

01:10:01.888 --> 01:10:03.491
there's only one way down.

01:10:04.861 --> 01:10:07.600
I lost it all. My home.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.702
My job.

01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:10.973
My manhood.

01:10:12.877 --> 01:10:14.914
When you lose something,

01:10:14.914 --> 01:10:16.718
there's only one thing to do,

01:10:18.789 --> 01:10:20.024
retrace your steps.

01:10:20.993 --> 01:10:22.830
[shrieking]

01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:38.662
[Duck Suck Song]
We are faced with a simple
complex formula, people.

01:10:39.664 --> 01:10:42.002
The tide
in the affairs of men

01:10:42.002 --> 01:10:45.174
have become a flood
in a bucket of tears.

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:47.279
It is time for us

01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:50.051
to build our castles
in the air.

01:10:55.295 --> 01:11:01.875
Fist, you have been looking
for the one for many moons.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:04.179
But you will never reach
your potential

01:11:04.179 --> 01:11:08.054
until you can forget
what you cannot remember.

01:11:17.138 --> 01:11:18.809
There has been

01:11:20.078 --> 01:11:24.286
and always was only one.

01:11:31.968 --> 01:11:34.306
He who cries in the dojo,

01:11:34.306 --> 01:11:36.210
laughs on the battlefield.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.959
The heartbeat of a man

01:11:43.959 --> 01:11:46.296
is what powers the earth.

01:11:46.296 --> 01:11:47.767
Listen for it.

01:11:49.035 --> 01:11:52.910
But do not dwell on it,
for like a thief,

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:55.716
if you let him in,
he will steal the night.

01:11:58.688 --> 01:12:00.391
Body, mind, soul must be one.

01:12:01.059 --> 01:12:02.930
Come on, punch me.

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:06.069
Punch me. Kick me.

01:12:06.771 --> 01:12:07.973
Kick me.

01:12:08.842 --> 01:12:10.077
[El Guapo] Get him, Fist.

01:12:10.077 --> 01:12:11.213
Again.

01:12:11.213 --> 01:12:12.883
Again, come on.

01:12:12.883 --> 01:12:14.386
[grunting]

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.103
Everyone gets knocked down.

01:12:23.103 --> 01:12:24.774
Just make sure
to punish the ground

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:26.276
so it knows
to hold you up next time.

01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:29.282
Man, this Chinese bullshit
don't work, Jack.

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:31.955
Fist, don't worry.

01:12:31.955 --> 01:12:34.226
I got something
to jack you up, man.

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:36.430
A little steroids,
a little cocaine.

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:39.102
I got a guy in Colombia.
Sosa.

01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:40.906
Class A shit.

01:12:40.906 --> 01:12:42.475
Man, this is the '80s.

01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:44.947
You can just go downtown,
baby.

01:12:44.947 --> 01:12:46.316
Now ju talking, Jackson.

01:12:47.485 --> 01:12:49.389
The temple is the body.

01:12:49.389 --> 01:12:50.826
If you burn it down,

01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:53.397
you cannot honor the gods.

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:56.804
Honor the gods!

01:12:56.804 --> 01:12:58.775
It's okay, Fist.
I'll be back, man.

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.244
We'll come back, come on.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.832
We're being watched.

01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:13.939
They're everywhere.

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:17.947
People will die.

heading for war in Brooklyn.

01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:28.067
And that means,
the war is here.

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:32.943
The war is here.

01:13:33.845 --> 01:13:36.316
Okay. Ju wanna go to war,

01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:43.083
It is not my time.

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:45.522
You have to defeat me,
if you want to take me.

01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:49.195
I have not come here
to fight you this time.

01:14:49.195 --> 01:14:50.464
But to warn you.

01:14:50.464 --> 01:14:54.139
You must fight
next to The Fist.

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:55.575
The Fist has lost his way.

01:14:56.376 --> 01:14:58.247
His heart is broken.

01:14:58.247 --> 01:15:02.589
There are many different ways
to the mountain's top.

01:15:02.589 --> 01:15:05.361
What matters is that
he gets there.

01:15:05.361 --> 01:15:07.298
He doesn't need me.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:10.104
You must fight with him.

01:15:10.104 --> 01:15:13.845

depends on your victory.

in from his castle in the sky.

Here, take this beret.

01:15:53.323 --> 01:15:56.964
You have been knighted
a black cat in Panther Fu.

Watch Fist's back.

Let's put these witches
in their places

Action Jackson.

Is that what you want?

This is why I do not
have children.

Will you fight with us?

Hell no! I got
a political action committee
to run.

Money doesn't
exactly raise itself.

That's all right,
I got this.

everybody looks up.

I do not need an invitation.

fought and won, man,

01:39:43.013 --> 01:39:45.586
but you know what,
the battle stays the same.

01:39:45.586 --> 01:39:47.021
You know what I'm
talking about, man?

01:39:47.021 --> 01:39:49.727
Because of the fact
you found the tiger's eye.
