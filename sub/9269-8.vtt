00:28.747 --> 00:30.107
Daddy?

00:38.340 --> 00:39.980
'Edward?'

00:41.500 --> 00:43.539
'Edward?'

00:43.540 --> 00:45.340
A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

00:45.953 --> 00:48.233
Yargh!

00:50.573 --> 00:53.572
Eddie! Eddie! Wake up!

00:53.573 --> 00:55.533
Eddie, wake up!

00:56.793 --> 00:58.513
You were dreaming!

01:00.153 --> 01:01.593
I'm sorry.

01:02.673 --> 01:05.111
It's all right.

01:05.113 --> 01:07.112
You're home now. You're safe.

01:07.113 --> 01:08.553
'Jia-Li?!'

01:11.593 --> 01:13.193
Go to your room.

01:22.433 --> 01:24.472
Stay away from her.

01:24.473 --> 01:25.953
Or you'll regret it, boy.

02:32.393 --> 02:34.472
Shot it myself, you know.

02:34.473 --> 02:36.392
Magnificent beast, is it not?

02:36.393 --> 02:38.313
Yes, I'm sure it was.

02:39.673 --> 02:41.233
Once. Jia-Li?

02:43.433 --> 02:46.952
Have I ever told you the story of how
this one came to live with us, Father?

02:46.953 --> 02:48.552
Papa, everyone knows that story.

02:48.553 --> 02:51.392
In a remote Chinese village,
she was six years old.

02:51.393 --> 02:53.312
She was knee-deep in a rice paddy,

02:53.313 --> 02:55.873
where she'd be to this day,
if I hadn't rescued her.

02:57.993 --> 03:00.552
Don't be angry, but Edward
won't come out of his room.

03:00.553 --> 03:02.952
What?! Why?!

03:02.953 --> 03:05.112
He's not ready yet, Cecil.
I've told you that.

03:05.113 --> 03:08.152
Rubbish. He's been moping about
for weeks. I'll fetch him myself.

03:08.153 --> 03:11.272
Let me talk to him, Papa!

03:11.273 --> 03:12.913
You stay and enjoy the party.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.553
All right.

03:22.793 --> 03:24.392
Perhaps Ada's right, Colonel.

03:24.393 --> 03:27.912
At the moment, a party may not be
what your nephew needs.

03:27.913 --> 03:31.073
Rubbish! I'd have been proud of the
honour when I returned from the war.

03:34.593 --> 03:36.672
Everyone's asking for you.

03:36.673 --> 03:38.512
Is everyone my uncle?

03:38.513 --> 03:42.072
Come on, stop being a bore.
You used to love parties.

03:42.073 --> 03:44.672
I see you're still happy
to let him dress you up.

03:44.673 --> 03:46.153
His very own China doll.

03:48.433 --> 03:49.592
I didn't mean that.

03:49.593 --> 03:52.993
I do what I can to keep the peace
around here. I know.

03:55.073 --> 03:56.512
I'm sorry.

03:56.513 --> 03:58.153
I'll come down.

04:10.993 --> 04:12.432
Nothing fits any more.

04:12.433 --> 04:14.433
Just tuck your shirt in.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.753
You could use a comb
once in a while.

04:22.513 --> 04:23.553
OK.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.273
I'm ready.

04:28.953 --> 04:31.152
I say, what have we here?

04:31.153 --> 04:33.993
Ooh, I may have to have
a... double helping.

04:35.033 --> 04:38.352
Alice!
Those are for the actual guests.

04:38.353 --> 04:40.033
Yes, Chef.

04:53.153 --> 04:56.112
Um... it... it, er...

04:56.113 --> 04:58.792
It was a proud moment for me

04:58.793 --> 05:02.112
to see my young nephew heading off
to serve his Queen and country.

05:02.113 --> 05:06.072
He has valiantly fought to rid us
of the cancer of Communism

05:06.073 --> 05:08.672
which threatens our free world.
So...

05:08.673 --> 05:13.792
let us all raise our glasses
in thanks to Edward.

05:13.793 --> 05:15.513
To Edward!

05:17.433 --> 05:19.432
Thank you.

05:19.433 --> 05:20.832
Thanks very much.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.192
A-hem!

05:22.193 --> 05:24.832
Let's not disappoint our friends,
Edward.

05:24.833 --> 05:28.153
I'm sure they'd all like to hear a
few words from the guest of honour.

05:34.113 --> 05:38.193
I-I'm very grateful to you all
for coming today.

05:41.393 --> 05:43.393
However, I do not share
my uncle's view.

05:46.353 --> 05:49.633
I hold no ill will toward
the North Koreans who captured me.

05:50.873 --> 05:53.472
I had no right to be
in their country in the first place.

05:53.473 --> 05:56.032
None of us did. All right,
um... let's have some music.

05:56.033 --> 05:58.752
I'm not ashamed to call them
my comrades!

05:58.753 --> 06:02.072
Silence me if you must,
but it won't change the truth!

06:02.073 --> 06:03.872
Let's find your shoes, Edward.

06:03.873 --> 06:07.832
Imperialism is the cancer,
not Communism.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.473
Down with capitalism!

06:11.873 --> 06:15.753
Please... please forgive my nephew.
I'm afraid...

06:17.073 --> 06:21.032
..torture does leave its mark
on a man in more ways than one.

06:21.033 --> 06:23.712
Let us not dwell on such horrors.
This is a joyous occasion.

06:23.713 --> 06:28.513
So please, all of you,
stay and enjoy the party.

06:33.913 --> 06:35.352
He's young, Colonel.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.592
I've indulged him
out of love for my brother.

06:37.593 --> 06:39.192
It's made him feeble-minded.

06:39.193 --> 06:40.912
Hm. I'm sure that's not true.

06:40.913 --> 06:42.672
There's something wrong
with his brain.

06:42.673 --> 06:45.112
I thought the war would make
a man of him. He's got worse.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.752
Perhaps I should talk to him, then.

06:47.753 --> 06:49.273
If you like. I never could.

07:06.273 --> 07:08.152
You're missing the festivities.

07:08.153 --> 07:10.353
I doubt I'd be very welcome now.
Do you?

07:12.233 --> 07:16.192
Not everyone warms to the sight
of a priest at a party either.

07:16.193 --> 07:19.113
But I've never let it keep me away
from a good rum punch.

07:22.153 --> 07:24.113
I know what it's like
to return from war...

07:25.273 --> 07:27.992
..and feel like a stranger
amongst your own.

07:27.993 --> 07:31.312
And after what you've been through...
I wasn't tortured.

07:31.313 --> 07:33.313
That just fits
with my uncle's narrative.

07:34.753 --> 07:36.592
But you were starved,
by all accounts.

07:36.593 --> 07:39.793
Should the villagers have fed us
before feeding their own children?

07:42.353 --> 07:44.712
Your mother says you suffer
from nightmares.

07:44.713 --> 07:46.272
Almost every night.

07:46.273 --> 07:48.472
So would you
if you lived in this house.

07:48.473 --> 07:49.673
What do you mean?

07:51.473 --> 07:52.512
Forget it.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.153
Whatever you have to say
will remain between us.

07:56.313 --> 07:59.353
And God, of course, but he's never
been known to betray a confidence.

08:02.433 --> 08:05.472
Perhaps you should ask the Colonel
what really happened to my father.

08:05.473 --> 08:07.592
I heard it was an accident.

08:07.593 --> 08:11.233
He was an experienced climber.
He never would have fallen.

08:13.593 --> 08:17.393
When my uncle sees something
he wants... he takes it.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.353
Like a little girl from China.

08:23.153 --> 08:25.112
Or his brother's wife.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.592
I saw the way
he looked at my mother.

08:27.593 --> 08:29.513
But you didn't see
what happened that day.

08:31.473 --> 08:34.153
I wanted to go with them, but
the Colonel said I was too young.

08:35.673 --> 08:37.352
You see?

08:37.352 --> 08:39.712
He didn't want any witnesses.

08:39.712 --> 08:42.952
Or he was protecting a young boy
from a hazardous climb

08:42.953 --> 08:45.872
that claimed the life of your father.

08:45.873 --> 08:49.632
I know it must've been painful
to see your mother remarry so soon.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.232
But perhaps you have to forgive
your uncle

08:52.233 --> 08:53.953
for replacing the man you loved.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.072
Father,
is that your second glass of punch?

09:02.073 --> 09:03.832
And my last.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.512
This house has you corrupted.

09:05.513 --> 09:09.072
Tigers and... foreigners!

09:09.073 --> 09:12.472
It's so lifelike.
Not a hair out of place.

09:12.473 --> 09:15.873
What a strange compulsion man has
to try and conquer nature.

09:17.113 --> 09:20.632
I fear someday we will reap
the whirlwind for such arrogance.

09:20.633 --> 09:23.432
Eddie! Get off me! Get off me!

09:23.433 --> 09:25.632
Eddie! Get off me!

09:25.633 --> 09:28.473
Stop! Don't! I'll kill you!

09:29.593 --> 09:32.312
Cecil!

09:32.313 --> 09:35.072
You all saw that. He's gone mad.
He's gone mad.

09:35.073 --> 09:37.953
And I'll see you put away for life,
boy!

09:47.153 --> 09:49.113
Edward? No.

09:58.353 --> 10:01.233
Is Edward all right?
He needs some time alone.

10:02.353 --> 10:03.592
I hate it when they fight.

10:03.593 --> 10:06.712
May I ask what the argument
was about? I wish I knew.

10:06.713 --> 10:08.993
I came in and they just flew
at each other.

10:10.553 --> 10:12.832
I should go and find Papa. Hm.

10:12.833 --> 10:15.353
Excuse me, Father. Of course.

10:34.393 --> 10:35.793
Upside down.

10:40.153 --> 10:42.112
Still up to your old tricks, I hope.

10:42.113 --> 10:45.032
I still see you're trying
to wind up your uncle.

10:45.033 --> 10:47.152
Your performance at that party,
that was...

10:47.153 --> 10:48.872
Well, I thought it was brilliant.

10:48.873 --> 10:50.472
It wasn't a performance.

10:50.473 --> 10:52.753
It's what I believe.
That's fair enough.

10:54.033 --> 10:57.473
If you need anybody to redistribute
a bit of wealth, you know where to find me.

11:01.313 --> 11:04.593
The world's a big place, Eddie.
What's keeping you here?

11:10.113 --> 11:11.712
Oh, I see.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.513
What?

11:16.033 --> 11:18.672
She's my sister. She's not
your blood, though, is she?

11:18.673 --> 11:19.753
That's not the point.

11:22.113 --> 11:24.392
I doubt the guests will be
back again in a hurry.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.192
Nonsense. Everybody loves a scandal.

11:27.193 --> 11:29.993
Gives them something to gossip
about, doesn't it, Mrs McCarthy?

11:31.913 --> 11:34.993
It's lucky for some
I know how to keep my mouth shut.

11:36.993 --> 11:38.553
Where are my scissors?

11:39.593 --> 11:42.272
I think Cecil means it this time.

11:42.273 --> 11:45.512
He wants Edward committed.
Surely that can be avoided.

11:45.513 --> 11:48.313
After Edward's behaviour this
afternoon, I very much doubt it.

11:49.553 --> 11:52.832
Is there anything
I can do to help, Mrs Gerard?

11:52.833 --> 11:54.432
You could stay the night, Father.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.072
I'd be delighted,
but how would that help?

11:57.073 --> 11:59.832
My husband respects you greatly,
as does my son.

11:59.833 --> 12:03.152
If they could just be in the same
room together without fighting,

12:03.153 --> 12:04.953
perhaps Cecil would reconsider.

12:05.953 --> 12:07.432
We'd have to leave first thing

12:07.433 --> 12:09.352
in the morning though, Father,
wouldn't we?

12:09.353 --> 12:13.232
Oh, yes, plenty of room
for you too, Mrs McCarthy.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.152
Well, if they're staying,
count me in.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.992
We'll make a night of it!

12:17.993 --> 12:21.513
The cheek of the woman,
inviting herself...

12:26.313 --> 12:31.672
If I asked you to do something
for me, no questions asked,

12:31.673 --> 12:34.632
would you do it?

12:34.633 --> 12:37.392
Would this something be illegal?

12:37.393 --> 12:41.072
Yes. I'd pay you of course.

12:41.073 --> 12:43.192
Course you will.

12:43.193 --> 12:44.953
All right.

12:55.113 --> 12:57.073
Sorry I'm late.

13:03.673 --> 13:06.833
We dine at seven in this house.

13:19.473 --> 13:23.793
I'd like to apologise to you all
for my behaviour today.

13:25.153 --> 13:29.312
I behaved abominably,
especially towards you, Uncle.

13:29.313 --> 13:30.832
I hope you can forgive me.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.752
You put yourself to shame, Edward.

13:32.753 --> 13:34.752
I'm just glad your father
wasn't here to see it.

13:34.753 --> 13:37.072
But it's brave to
admit you're wrong,

13:37.073 --> 13:39.033
so I accept your apology.

13:41.353 --> 13:44.032
Thank you, Uncle.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.312
Well...

13:45.313 --> 13:48.112
Father Brown, do we have you
to thank for this

13:48.113 --> 13:50.232
welcome change in my nephew?

13:50.233 --> 13:54.552
Not at all. I think
Edward knows his own mind.

13:54.553 --> 13:56.592
Perhaps you'd like
to say Grace, Father,

13:56.593 --> 13:59.473
before the soup gets any colder.
I thought you'd never ask.

14:01.313 --> 14:04.073
In nonime Patris et filii et
Spiritus Sancti...

14:15.473 --> 14:18.152
Cecil? Where are you going?
To bed.

14:18.153 --> 14:21.032
But it's only nine o'clock.
I've got indigestion.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.832
Cecil, Father Brown
stayed especially

14:22.833 --> 14:24.472
and Edward wants to make amends.

14:24.473 --> 14:26.272
Won't you have a brandy
with him at least?

14:26.273 --> 14:28.752
Why, do you want me to change
my mind about the mad house?

14:28.753 --> 14:31.072
Edward said he was sorry.

14:31.073 --> 14:34.312
Look, Cecil,
he's not ill, he's just confused.

14:34.313 --> 14:36.712
We need to be patient with him.

14:36.713 --> 14:39.792
He'll forget these silly
notions about the war and...

14:39.793 --> 14:42.392
get back to normal.

14:42.393 --> 14:43.792
Don't embarrass yourself.

14:43.793 --> 14:45.432
You may have been beautiful once,

14:45.433 --> 14:47.673
but that was a very, very
long time ago.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.952
Hey! Hey! Let her go!

14:51.953 --> 14:54.912
How dare you treat
my sister this way!

14:54.913 --> 14:57.272
Rupert, it's nothing,
go back and join the others.

14:57.273 --> 15:00.432
It's not nothing. He's a brute
and I won't stand for it.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.192
And you are a fat, lazy imbecile

15:02.193 --> 15:04.952
who's lived off my hospitality
for far too long.

15:04.953 --> 15:06.672
So if you don't like
the way I run my home,

15:06.673 --> 15:08.072
I suggest you find another one.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.512
Tomorrow.

15:09.513 --> 15:12.113
Tell Jia-Li to bring me up
some stomach salts.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.432
Morning, Father.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.793
Lovely.

15:45.473 --> 15:48.352
It's a shame the Colonel had to
retire so early last night.

15:48.353 --> 15:51.432
Is it? Remember the tantrum
he had last time we played charades?

15:51.433 --> 15:54.992
You were teasing him mercilessly,
Felicia, as well you know.

15:54.993 --> 15:58.112
Jia-Li, be a dear and see if
your father will be joining us.

15:58.113 --> 16:00.153
Yes, Mama.

16:09.273 --> 16:11.392
Morning, all.

16:11.393 --> 16:12.992
Mother.

16:12.993 --> 16:16.032
Did you sleep well, darling?
Well, thank you.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.952
No more nightmares.

16:17.953 --> 16:21.232
I'm glad somebody slept well last
night, because I didn't get a wink.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.393
And why was that, Mrs McCarthy?

16:42.353 --> 16:44.153
What happened to him?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.072
Some room please, Father.

17:03.073 --> 17:04.553
Apologies, Inspector.

17:08.792 --> 17:13.632
Mrs Gerard, may I ask why your
husband's body was undiscovered

17:13.633 --> 17:16.872
until this morning?
This is your bedroom, isn't it?

17:16.873 --> 17:18.912
I have a private room.

17:18.913 --> 17:22.672
You say the Colonel was
complaining of indigestion?

17:22.673 --> 17:27.152
Yes, just after dinner. My daughter
brought him some stomach salts.

17:27.153 --> 17:28.832
And what time was this?

17:28.833 --> 17:30.752
About ten o'clock.

17:30.753 --> 17:33.152
He was in too much pain
to get out of bed.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.392
I wanted to call a doctor,
but he said no.

17:35.393 --> 17:38.553
Residue of stomach salts, sir.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.912
I take it no-one else was unwell?

17:41.913 --> 17:44.472
Did you all eat the same
food last night? Yes.

17:44.473 --> 17:46.352
Some more than others.

17:46.353 --> 17:48.472
And did anyone enter the
room after ten o'clock?

17:48.473 --> 17:49.872
Somebody did.

17:49.873 --> 17:52.672
My room was directly below
and I heard nothing

17:52.673 --> 17:54.872
but creaking floorboards
half the night.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.353
Well, it clearly wasn't the Colonel.

17:58.353 --> 18:00.352
So which of you was it?

18:00.353 --> 18:03.392
Hmm... Strange consistency.

18:03.393 --> 18:05.192
Quite unlike stomach salts.

18:05.193 --> 18:06.872
I can't think what it could be.

18:06.873 --> 18:09.353
That's what laboratories
are for, Father.

18:15.873 --> 18:17.433
Papa...

18:20.073 --> 18:22.752
Jia-Li, is it?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.232
Did I say that right?

18:25.233 --> 18:27.632
Can I ask how you came to live
with the Gerard family?

18:27.633 --> 18:29.312
What's that got to do with anything?

18:29.313 --> 18:31.632
I'm merely establishing
Miss Gerard's relationship

18:31.633 --> 18:34.232
with the deceased. She's adopted.

18:34.233 --> 18:37.673
Now, if you don't mind, my sister's
been through enough today.

18:39.673 --> 18:42.552
Would you care to tell me
what happened to your lip?

18:42.553 --> 18:44.712
I had a disagreement with my uncle.

18:44.713 --> 18:46.552
What about?

18:46.553 --> 18:49.872
Just about everything...
over the years.

18:49.873 --> 18:52.552
That's not a crime, is it?

18:52.553 --> 18:56.033
We'll find out.
After the post mortem.

18:59.073 --> 19:02.992
Listen, Father, I didn't want to say
anything in front of the coppers,

19:02.993 --> 19:05.672
cos I didn't want to get
Edward in trouble...

19:05.673 --> 19:08.312
or me, for that matter.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.193
I'm involved. Involved in what?

19:26.913 --> 19:29.232
Are you fond of theatre, Edward?

19:29.233 --> 19:30.672
Not especially.

19:30.673 --> 19:36.232
No? Nothing better than
a bit of Shakespeare.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.992
King Lear. Macbeth.

19:38.993 --> 19:44.112
You must know this one - young
Prince of Denmark, Hamlet his name,

19:44.113 --> 19:48.192
pretends to be mad in order
to murder his uncle

19:48.193 --> 19:51.032
and avenge his father's death.

19:51.033 --> 19:54.473
That's not funny. No, it's not.

19:55.593 --> 19:57.433
I know about the passports.

20:02.313 --> 20:05.392
You were planning to
leg it with your sister.

20:05.393 --> 20:07.872
Not the action of an innocent man.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.192
I wanted us to leave, that's all.

20:11.193 --> 20:13.872
If we'd travelled under our
real names, he would've found us.

20:13.873 --> 20:18.352
He'd have seen it as theft,
do you understand?

20:18.353 --> 20:21.352
Jia-Li belonged to him.

20:21.353 --> 20:25.953
The truth is, Father, I wish
I'd had the courage to kill him.

20:33.353 --> 20:34.593
Mr Digby.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.833
Father. Didn't see you there.

20:40.953 --> 20:44.032
If you don't mind my saying so,
you seem rather anxious to avoid me.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.912
Me? No!

20:45.913 --> 20:47.392
Not at all!

20:47.393 --> 20:49.192
Glad to hear it.

20:49.193 --> 20:52.672
Because if there was something you
wanted to get off your chest,

20:52.673 --> 20:55.792
you know I'm always here to listen...

20:55.793 --> 20:57.712
May God forgive me...

20:57.713 --> 20:59.272
What is it?

20:59.273 --> 21:01.233
I've committed a grave sin...

21:02.313 --> 21:04.712
Do you think it's too early
for a gin and tonic?

21:04.713 --> 21:07.592
Not at all! Take the edge off.

21:07.593 --> 21:10.513
There's no need to run, is there?
Mr Digby?

21:41.153 --> 21:43.113
Hello again...

22:22.713 --> 22:24.473
Ah...

22:37.553 --> 22:39.233
I need to speak to the chef.

22:41.913 --> 22:44.833
Inspector?
Not now, Father.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.512
They were found in the
Colonel's stomach.

22:50.513 --> 22:53.512
And you think these
came from my kitchen?

22:53.513 --> 22:55.152
Herbs? Oui.

22:55.153 --> 22:57.192
Spices? Oui.

22:57.193 --> 22:59.152
Disgusting fragments?

22:59.153 --> 23:00.752
Non!

23:00.753 --> 23:02.913
So you have no idea what it is?

23:05.473 --> 23:07.152
Tiger's whiskers.

23:07.153 --> 23:11.312
What? Cut finely enough,
they can be sprinkled on food.

23:11.313 --> 23:14.752
Tasteless, odourless,
virtually invisible,

23:14.753 --> 23:17.512
but sharp enough to
penetrate the intestines.

23:17.513 --> 23:22.112
Chinese assassination technique
known since the 17th century.

23:22.113 --> 23:24.112
How do you know this?

23:24.113 --> 23:29.313
Well, anyone could know it if
they consulted this Encyclopaedia.

23:30.353 --> 23:32.512
The Colonel died of
massive haemorrhaging.

23:32.513 --> 23:35.832
Somebody here put
tiger's whiskers in his food.

23:35.833 --> 23:39.072
That's preposterous!
We all loved Cecil dearly.

23:39.073 --> 23:42.952
I suppose that's why Edward
threatened to kill him yesterday?

23:42.953 --> 23:46.872
We all saw him,
he had his hands around his throat.

23:46.873 --> 23:51.112
That's right. Because he was
a selfish, imperialistic boor

23:51.113 --> 23:53.672
and I despised everything
he stood for. Eddie, don't.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.752
Why not? I'm not sorry he's dead
and I don't care who knows it.

23:56.753 --> 23:58.792
Well, perhaps you'll care
in the dock.

23:58.793 --> 24:01.912
Edward Gerard, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

24:01.913 --> 24:03.992
of Colonel Gerard. No!

24:03.993 --> 24:06.112
Get your hands off me. Inspector...

24:06.113 --> 24:08.352
He murdered my father, you know!

24:08.353 --> 24:10.312
Where were you lot then? Eh?!

24:10.313 --> 24:13.632
He doesn't know what he's saying.
He's not in his right mind!

24:13.633 --> 24:14.952
He was brainwashed in Korea.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.152
Father Brown can vouch for it,
can't you, Father?

24:17.153 --> 24:19.072
I doubt if my opinion
has any relevance.

24:19.073 --> 24:20.592
That rarely holds you back.

24:20.593 --> 24:24.632
But I believe Edward's
war experiences have

24:24.633 --> 24:26.272
affected his behaviour...

24:26.273 --> 24:29.072
but I'd say he's completely sane.

24:29.073 --> 24:32.392
Are you prepared to
testify to that in court?

24:32.393 --> 24:34.153
If I'm called upon.

24:35.473 --> 24:39.433
May I ask what was the substance
on Colonel Gerard's pyjamas?

24:40.593 --> 24:42.192
It has me puzzled.

24:42.193 --> 24:44.832
You and me both. It was cornflour.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.872
He'd ingested it.

24:46.873 --> 24:49.072
Cornflour...

24:49.073 --> 24:51.072
It was my duty, Father,
to tell the police,

24:51.073 --> 24:52.912
whether Edward's innocent or not.

24:52.913 --> 24:54.072
Quite right.

24:54.073 --> 24:57.512
But if he is innocent, that raises
a rather troubling question.

24:57.513 --> 25:00.312
The answer to which may be
under our very noses.

25:00.313 --> 25:02.673
Or rather, the nose of a tiger...

25:09.713 --> 25:11.952
Let us apply our reason.

25:11.953 --> 25:14.192
Last time we saw
the tiger intact was

25:14.193 --> 25:15.952
when we stood beneath it
at the party.

25:15.953 --> 25:18.392
What time that was?
About six o'clock.

25:18.393 --> 25:22.032
We then went in to dine
together which is

25:22.033 --> 25:24.432
when the Colonel must have
swallowed the whiskers.

25:24.433 --> 25:26.072
He remained in our company,

25:26.073 --> 25:29.752
and began feeling unwell
around nine o'clock.

25:29.753 --> 25:33.792
So the killer would have had to
have been alone with

25:33.793 --> 25:36.592
the tiger in the hour
preceding dinner...

25:36.593 --> 25:40.273
You're getting rather
good at this, Mrs McCarthy. Oh!

25:43.153 --> 25:49.192
So, all we have to do is confirm
the whereabouts of everybody

25:49.193 --> 25:51.512
during that crucial hour.

25:51.513 --> 25:55.792
Edward was late for dinner,
so we can't rule him out.

25:55.793 --> 25:57.792
Jia-Li was looking for the Colonel.

25:57.793 --> 26:01.992
Mrs Gerard was with us,
but she left shortly after.

26:01.993 --> 26:04.232
And the tiger's just next door...

26:04.233 --> 26:05.792
Well observed.

26:05.793 --> 26:10.672
However, if you recall, her scissors
had already been stolen.

26:10.673 --> 26:13.432
Why draw attention to that
if you're the killer?

26:13.433 --> 26:17.312
True enough. Then there's
the incomprehensible chef.

26:17.313 --> 26:19.713
And Mr Digby, of course.

26:29.353 --> 26:31.752
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

26:31.753 --> 26:33.952
Is this a private party
or can anyone join in?

26:33.953 --> 26:36.752
Lady Felicia, perhaps you'd
like to take Mrs McCarthy

26:36.753 --> 26:39.513
outside for a breath of fresh air.
Oh, yes...

26:46.313 --> 26:48.592
I say, you won't tell
my sister, will you?

26:48.593 --> 26:50.432
She'll think me terribly callous.

26:50.433 --> 26:52.152
My lips are sealed, Mr Digby.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.793
However, you need to loosen yours.

26:56.953 --> 27:00.112
Yesterday, where were you
the hour before we dined?

27:00.113 --> 27:02.272
I'm afraid much as you
found me now, Father.

27:02.273 --> 27:04.792
Only in a linen cupboard, upstairs.

27:04.793 --> 27:06.552
With an Eton Mess.

27:06.553 --> 27:08.912
Which it certainly was.

27:08.913 --> 27:10.992
Oh.

27:10.993 --> 27:14.592
So what was the grave sin you wanted
to confess to me earlier?

27:14.593 --> 27:18.992
This morning,
when I saw Cecil dead...

27:18.993 --> 27:21.952
I'd never felt happier in my life.

27:21.953 --> 27:23.712
What sort of man am I, Father,

27:23.713 --> 27:29.032
to feel joy, even as my dear
nephew faces the gallows?

27:29.033 --> 27:34.593
None of us can censor our feelings,
Mr Digby, only our actions.

27:36.193 --> 27:39.072
Did you play a part in
the Colonel's death?

27:39.073 --> 27:40.752
Certainly not.

27:40.753 --> 27:43.153
Then the killer alone
must bear the guilt.

27:45.313 --> 27:46.953
Guilt...

27:57.633 --> 27:59.713
Alice! Stir the soup.

28:01.753 --> 28:03.512
Er, no, thank you.

28:03.513 --> 28:05.992
May I ask how you came to be
working for the Colonel?

28:05.993 --> 28:09.153
My mother cooked for
his family in Indochina.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.833
I'll let you get on.

28:16.913 --> 28:19.993
Oh, just one more thing.

28:21.473 --> 28:24.952
Could I possibly
borrow some cornflour?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.593
Cornflour? Oui.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.072
Alice! Where's the cornflour?

28:30.073 --> 28:34.352
I don't know. Imbecile!
You never put things back!

28:34.353 --> 28:37.033
That's OK, thank you.

28:44.033 --> 28:48.952
I was here, freshening up
before dinner. Why do you ask?

28:48.953 --> 28:52.432
Well, we're all pieces
in this puzzle, Mrs Gerard.

28:52.433 --> 28:54.992
I was just wondering
where to place you.

28:54.993 --> 28:59.632
You mean... you think Edward
might be innocent?

28:59.633 --> 29:01.312
Don't you?

29:01.313 --> 29:04.472
I brought him into
the world, Father.

29:04.473 --> 29:07.272
You couldn't hope for
a gentler child.

29:07.273 --> 29:09.633
But everyone has
their breaking point.

29:12.193 --> 29:14.713
Cecil enjoyed thrashing him,
you see.

29:16.593 --> 29:18.752
I'd see it in his eyes.

29:18.753 --> 29:22.392
I mean, what kind of a monster...

29:22.393 --> 29:24.352
I'm sorry, Father.

29:24.353 --> 29:26.953
I know I shouldn't speak
ill of the dead.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.873
Not everyone deserves
a favourable epitaph.

29:36.193 --> 29:38.192
Did he ever harm Jia-Li?

29:38.193 --> 29:39.833
No, never. You?

29:48.593 --> 29:51.752
You will stay to dinner,
won't you, Father?

29:51.753 --> 29:53.952
Having you here is such a comfort.

29:53.953 --> 29:55.433
I'd be honoured.

30:00.033 --> 30:04.272
Didn't know you smoked, Mrs Gerard?

30:04.273 --> 30:06.513
Only occasionally.

30:14.273 --> 30:17.032
Why do you think Henri stayed on
all these years?

30:17.033 --> 30:20.032
It wasn't for the salary,
that's for sure.

30:20.033 --> 30:24.032
Now the Colonel's gone,
he has Ada all to himself...

30:24.033 --> 30:25.832
Good for them, I say.

30:25.833 --> 30:28.672
I hear he's a tiger in bed.

30:28.673 --> 30:30.873
Sorry, poor taste.

30:42.113 --> 30:44.152
Fish soup.

30:44.153 --> 30:45.633
Une bouillabaisse.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.313
Would you like to say Grace, Father?

30:51.153 --> 30:54.593
In nonime Patris et filii
et Spiritus Sancti.

30:56.993 --> 31:01.312
Lord, as we give thanks
for Thy great bounty,

31:01.313 --> 31:03.552
we humbly ask a blessing
for one who cannot

31:03.553 --> 31:07.192
break bread with us here today...

31:07.193 --> 31:10.192
Let young Edward
be filled with Thy Love,

31:10.193 --> 31:13.673
that he may face the trials
ahead without fear.

31:22.713 --> 31:24.912
What is it, Father?

31:24.913 --> 31:28.792
It seems everyone had a motive
for killing the Colonel.

31:28.793 --> 31:31.352
And I'm no closer to a suspect.

31:31.353 --> 31:36.113
Well, maybe Inspector Sullivan
arrested the right man.

31:39.353 --> 31:41.353
Or maybe not...

31:42.953 --> 31:44.633
They're all gone...

31:45.953 --> 31:49.152
Who on earth would want
to poison any of us?

31:49.153 --> 31:51.672
That has yet to be determined.

31:51.673 --> 31:53.712
Please, try and remain calm.

31:53.713 --> 31:55.912
Calm? You saw what happened to Papa.

31:55.913 --> 31:58.752
He died a slow, agonising death.

31:58.753 --> 32:01.152
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.552
Rupert!

32:03.553 --> 32:04.952
Mr Digby...

32:04.953 --> 32:08.032
The pain, it's unbearable!

32:08.033 --> 32:09.712
Well, somebody DO something!

32:09.713 --> 32:11.712
I'll call for an ambulance.

32:11.713 --> 32:13.793
Why me? I don't want to die!

32:15.673 --> 32:18.152
Ooh!

32:18.153 --> 32:20.392
Actually, that's much better.

32:20.393 --> 32:21.833
Oh, heavens.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.033
Apologies, ladies.

32:28.153 --> 32:30.553
Father Brown, are you all right?

32:32.073 --> 32:34.873
I'm perfectly well, thank you.
Oh, Father Brown.

32:36.473 --> 32:39.312
It's you. You must have eaten them.

32:39.313 --> 32:41.072
I'm sure it's nothing.

32:41.073 --> 32:43.472
No arguments, you are going
straight to the hospital!

32:43.473 --> 32:46.472
And what could they do
if I HAVE swallowed them?

32:46.473 --> 32:48.832
I'd rather use my time wisely.

32:48.833 --> 32:52.672
Mrs Gerard, erm... I'd like
to make a phone call, please.

32:52.673 --> 32:55.792
I think Inspector Sullivan should
know that the killer

32:55.793 --> 32:57.313
has struck again...

32:58.513 --> 33:01.432
Round everyone up
and search the premises.

33:01.433 --> 33:04.112
Miss Gerard, the Inspector
wants us all inside.

33:04.113 --> 33:05.672
I need to see Edward.

33:05.673 --> 33:07.232
What's going on?

33:07.233 --> 33:08.912
Father Brown's been poisoned too.

33:08.913 --> 33:10.553
What?

33:12.113 --> 33:14.472
Is that everyone?

33:14.473 --> 33:16.432
Is it true?

33:16.433 --> 33:18.032
Do you mind? I'm in the middle of...

33:18.033 --> 33:20.313
Has he been poisoned?!

33:22.233 --> 33:24.992
Who did it? Eh?

33:24.993 --> 33:27.872
That's what I intend to find out...
Oh!

33:27.873 --> 33:29.392
Oh, this is absurd.

33:29.393 --> 33:32.192
Do you really think one
of us would harm a priest?

33:32.193 --> 33:35.072
I think the facts
speak for themselves.

33:35.073 --> 33:37.752
I want each and every one of you
to account

33:37.753 --> 33:39.952
for your whereabouts
before dinner.

33:39.953 --> 33:42.792
Where would a chef be
before dinner...?!

33:42.793 --> 33:45.312
I was playing backgammon
with Lady Felicia.

33:45.313 --> 33:47.553
And I was with Father Brown.

33:55.233 --> 33:59.033
Drag marks, from this chest.

34:06.073 --> 34:08.992
Because the killer couldn't reach...

34:08.993 --> 34:11.351
Where is Jia-Li Gerard?

34:11.353 --> 34:14.553
He's dying? Are you sure?

34:16.672 --> 34:19.992
Who would do such a thing?
The same person who killed Papa.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.592
But who? I don't know.

34:22.592 --> 34:25.193
All that matters is
they'll have to let you go.

34:28.072 --> 34:30.192
Jia-Li?

34:30.193 --> 34:31.712
I have to go.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.632
Tell me it wasn't you.

34:33.632 --> 34:35.712
Officer, I'd like to go now.

34:35.713 --> 34:38.032
Just one minute more, please.
Stand back, Mr Gerard.

34:38.033 --> 34:40.232
Jia-Li! I'll see you soon.

34:40.233 --> 34:41.793
Jia-Li!

34:43.313 --> 34:45.391
Officer, do you...

34:45.393 --> 34:48.793
Miss Gerard, would you
step into my office, please?

34:57.633 --> 35:02.152
What is this? Your mistake -
finally catching up with you.

35:02.153 --> 35:03.872
What mistake?

35:03.873 --> 35:06.152
The assumption that
no-one would be arrested...

35:06.153 --> 35:09.233
so obscure was your method
of murdering your father...

35:12.833 --> 35:14.512
Is Edward all right?

35:14.513 --> 35:17.672
You claimed to go off
in search of the Colonel,

35:17.673 --> 35:20.153
an alibi that could
not be contested.

35:21.793 --> 35:25.353
But once alone with the tiger,
your height proved a problem...

35:30.113 --> 35:34.032
That's absurd. When could
I have put it in Papa's food?

35:34.033 --> 35:36.872
It happened before
our very eyes.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.872
Because our eyes were closed.

35:38.873 --> 35:42.592
I suspect you repeated
the same trick this evening,

35:42.593 --> 35:44.353
while I was saying Grace.

35:45.993 --> 35:48.033
Stop! Stay there!

35:57.593 --> 35:59.672
Miss Gerard!

35:59.673 --> 36:02.953
Miss Gerard, you're only making
this worse for yourself.

36:04.473 --> 36:06.233
Miss Gerard, we're coming in.

36:11.673 --> 36:13.312
Get the car.

36:13.313 --> 36:16.712
Find out from Edward
if he knows where she'd go.

36:16.713 --> 36:18.272
Then release him.

36:18.273 --> 36:19.752
Someone must have seen her.

36:19.753 --> 36:22.792
There can't be too many Chinese
women in these parts.

36:22.793 --> 36:24.672
We have to find her first.

36:24.673 --> 36:27.232
Hang about, first thing we need
to do is get you to a hospital.

36:27.233 --> 36:30.192
Not while a young girl's soul's
in danger. Father, I'm not arguing!

36:30.193 --> 36:32.793
No! The only thing left
for me to do now is pray.

36:40.113 --> 36:44.512
O most merciful Jesus,
Lover of souls,

36:44.513 --> 36:47.912
I pray Thee, by the agony
of Thy most Sacred Heart,

36:47.913 --> 36:50.792
and by the suffering of
Thy Immaculate Mother...

36:50.793 --> 36:52.473
Argh!

36:53.593 --> 36:57.072
Cleanse in Thine Own Blood
this humble sinner

36:57.073 --> 36:59.552
who in his agony
is to die today...

36:59.553 --> 37:03.033
Heart of Jesus,
once in agony, pity me.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.673
Father Brown!

37:08.393 --> 37:11.432
You're not going to die.
I have a cure.

37:11.433 --> 37:13.752
You need to drink
cornflour and water.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.312
It won't work.

37:15.313 --> 37:19.232
Yes, it will,
I was just too late before.

37:19.233 --> 37:23.192
It's just a forgotten passage
in an outdated book.

37:23.193 --> 37:27.673
Remembered by a little lost girl
and remembered as truth.

37:30.953 --> 37:32.793
What have I done?

37:36.713 --> 37:41.752
What have I done, more to the point,
to deserve this gruesome end?

37:41.753 --> 37:44.512
You were going to testify.

37:44.513 --> 37:48.032
An insanity plea was
Edward's only hope.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.032
Unless you confessed.

37:50.033 --> 37:51.952
Who'd have believed me?

37:51.953 --> 37:55.473
They'd have thought
I was lying to protect him.

37:57.193 --> 38:00.632
But no jury would doubt
the word of a priest.

38:00.633 --> 38:04.033
I'm so sorry, Father.
I never meant to kill a man of God.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.552
Well, that's lucky.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.793
Because I never ate the
whiskers in the first place.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.392
What?

38:14.393 --> 38:18.392
Fortunately, The Lord gave me
an aversion to fish soup.

38:18.393 --> 38:21.432
But... I saw you eating it.
Did you?

38:21.433 --> 38:26.232
It's a ruse to avoid
offending my hosts.

38:26.233 --> 38:29.152
It seems I'm becoming
a rather good actor.

38:29.153 --> 38:31.473
I almost believed I was ill myself.

38:33.073 --> 38:34.912
But why pretend?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.632
Because I knew the killer
had a conscience.

38:37.633 --> 38:40.152
The cornflour in the
Colonel's stomach proved that.

38:40.153 --> 38:43.312
This evening, when no-one else
was afflicted,

38:43.313 --> 38:45.633
I realised I was the intended victim.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.392
I took a chance that
your guilt would bring you

38:51.393 --> 38:54.313
to my church in order
to undo your crime.

38:56.233 --> 38:59.952
Can you ever forgive me, Father?
For the attempt on my life, yes.

38:59.953 --> 39:02.352
For the Colonel's,

39:02.353 --> 39:04.353
only God can forgive you.

39:06.553 --> 39:10.312
He has to forgive her.
She was driven to it.

39:10.313 --> 39:14.152
How can you defend her after
everything that she's done?

39:14.153 --> 39:16.113
Because I love her.

39:22.833 --> 39:26.032
But it's not that simple,
is it, Jia-Li?

39:26.033 --> 39:28.633
Your father had designs on you...

39:31.633 --> 39:33.433
You're lovelier by the day.

39:34.993 --> 39:36.992
He'll never have you, you know.

39:36.993 --> 39:38.713
Do you understand?

39:39.873 --> 39:43.512
Papa! I didn't take you in,
look after you, feed you, clothe you

39:43.513 --> 39:45.592
to share you with anyone.

39:45.593 --> 39:47.192
Don't!

39:47.193 --> 39:49.792
Get away from her!
I'll do what I like with her.

39:49.793 --> 39:51.273
Get off me. Eddie! No!

39:52.313 --> 39:53.753
Get off me!

39:55.113 --> 39:56.873
I'll kill you!

39:58.033 --> 39:59.512
Cecil!

39:59.513 --> 40:02.232
He would've kept Edward locked
up to have me for himself.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.872
Motive enough for murder.

40:04.873 --> 40:07.393
Yet you still tried
to save him...

40:08.753 --> 40:10.632
I was afraid of what he'd made me.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.913
You have to drink this.

40:15.513 --> 40:17.953
What is it? It'll fix you.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.273
Who did this?

40:25.073 --> 40:27.952
Tell Edward...

40:27.953 --> 40:30.112
his father

40:30.113 --> 40:32.673
screamed like a child.

40:34.673 --> 40:36.913
And I pushed him.

40:39.473 --> 40:42.592
I looked the devil
in the eye that night.

40:42.593 --> 40:45.393
And I saw my own face
looking back at me.

40:47.433 --> 40:50.392
He deserved to die.
Because he took a life...

40:50.393 --> 40:52.233
So did I.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.752
That's why I'm giving myself up.

40:56.753 --> 40:59.992
Jia-Li, you can't. They'll hang you.

40:59.993 --> 41:04.392
Then that's what I deserve.
Don't say that. We can still run.

41:04.393 --> 41:06.872
I can never run from what I did.

41:06.873 --> 41:08.832
You're not like him.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.112
You'll never be like him.

41:11.113 --> 41:13.313
Jia-Li, please.

41:15.513 --> 41:17.872
I need you.

41:17.873 --> 41:20.272
I'm sorry.

41:20.273 --> 41:22.312
Father, tell her not to do this.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.713
That's a decision
only Jia-Li can make.

41:26.153 --> 41:29.632
But if I were her, I'd ask myself

41:29.633 --> 41:31.993
if I felt true remorse for my sin?

41:33.953 --> 41:35.632
Yes.

41:35.633 --> 41:38.312
And I'd ask myself if
I acted selflessly

41:38.313 --> 41:40.793
out of love for another human being?

41:44.393 --> 41:45.993
Yes.

41:47.393 --> 41:52.313
Then if you truly repent before God,
He will know what is in your heart.

41:54.753 --> 41:57.232
Here. Come on...

41:57.233 --> 42:01.112
Well, I'd hate a good forgery
to go to waste.

42:01.113 --> 42:03.553
There isn't much time...

42:19.553 --> 42:21.952
Inspector, what brings you here?

42:21.953 --> 42:26.112
Mrs McCarthy called us.
She saw Jia-Li entering the church.

42:26.113 --> 42:29.752
Really?
Well, she's not here now.

42:29.753 --> 42:32.592
Search the area, quickly.

42:32.593 --> 42:35.832
When I find her, there'll be
questions to answer...

42:35.833 --> 42:37.633
from both of you.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.592
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

42:42.593 --> 42:44.272
Turns out it was just wind.

42:44.273 --> 42:46.753
Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord...

42:58.433 --> 43:01.112
Her husband's barely been
in the ground a month.

43:01.113 --> 43:03.153
People grieve in different ways.

43:05.393 --> 43:06.833
Ooh! Naughty man.

43:08.033 --> 43:10.233
I'm so glad you were able to come.

43:11.593 --> 43:14.752
Shame Edward and Jia-Li
couldn't be here.

43:14.753 --> 43:17.272
Have you heard from them recently?

43:17.273 --> 43:20.633
Actually, Father,
they're the reason for this party.

43:22.073 --> 43:23.312
Ah...

43:23.313 --> 43:27.393
This arrived a few days ago.
No return address.

43:33.233 --> 43:35.753
Sound advice, Mrs Gerard.

43:41.033 --> 43:42.792
Thank you, no.

43:42.793 --> 43:45.873
I'll never eat another morsel
in this house.

43:48.993 --> 43:51.472
Don't worry, Mrs McCarthy,
you're perfectly safe.

43:51.473 --> 43:53.633
He's quite harmless now.
