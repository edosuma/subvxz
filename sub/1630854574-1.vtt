00:26.860 --> 00:29.988
<i>On a very special night every year,</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:36.578
<i>legend has it that a jolly old man</i>
<i>in a red suit flies through the air</i>

00:36.661 --> 00:41.583
<i>and brings gifts, laughter,</i>
<i>and joy to children everywhere.</i>

00:51.384 --> 00:55.430
<i>There are those who believe in him</i>
<i>and those who don't.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:06.149
And so I say, God bless America.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.861
Of course. So I say, God bless America.

01:09.944 --> 01:14.574
Of course,
but God bless our different views?

01:15.825 --> 01:19.037
Yeah. Oh, I think ours, freedom.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.082
God bless freedom in all of its forms.

01:22.165 --> 01:22.999
Okay.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.794
Yes.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.046
"Forms." All right…

01:28.129 --> 01:31.925
Uh-huh. Yes, that sounds perfect.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.427
-Okay, thank you.
-Yeah!

01:36.429 --> 01:39.682
I finally set up an interview
with Mallards for my article

01:39.766 --> 01:41.184
about their fall fashion line.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.270
And I just sent Grant
my Fourth of July article.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.189
Ah! Well, yours is better.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.358
This was the easiest article
I've ever had to write.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.818
It practically wrote itself.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.611
I love this holiday.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.655
-Lisa!
-Yes, Grant?

01:53.738 --> 01:56.241
-Did you just email me your article?
-Yes, Grant.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.243
Did you mention hot dogs?

01:58.326 --> 01:59.661
I did.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.081
I cannot wait for wiener ads
next to my article.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.749
Yeah, well, we got to keep the lights on.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.585
Oh, uh, did you mention the ski pants?

02:08.169 --> 02:11.256
It is an article about the Fourth of July.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.173
We'll talk.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.178
You just said "wiener" to Grant.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.306
-You're my hero.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.184
Oh, okay. You know what?
I gotta go pick up

02:23.268 --> 02:25.770
Ella's bumblebee costume
for this Saturday.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.939
I thought that Robert was on fair duty.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.901
I volunteered to get the costume.
We are still on for this weekend.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.320
"Independence Day."

02:35.280 --> 02:36.865
"Best holiday on the calendar."

02:40.118 --> 02:42.412
<i>"The Fourth of July never lets you down."</i>

02:42.495 --> 02:45.665
<i>"It's just simple, summer fun with games,</i>

02:45.748 --> 02:48.376
<i>"parades, concerts, burgers…"</i>

02:48.459 --> 02:52.213
<i>…hot dogs and bursts</i>
<i>of fiery embers in the sky.</i>

02:52.297 --> 02:55.550
<i>There's no cooking a turkey for six hours.</i>

02:55.633 --> 02:58.720
<i>No cross-country travel</i>
<i>through snow and ice,</i>

02:59.345 --> 03:01.764
<i>no feeling pressure to spend money,</i>

03:01.848 --> 03:05.018
<i>which makes it way better than Christmas.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:07.020
"Way better than Christmas"?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.771
Pfft. That's lame.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.857
-Who wrote this?

03:10.940 --> 03:13.651
Hey, Assan, I'm glad you're up.
I'm gonna get you in, like, 30 minutes.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.029
We have to set up the booth.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.198
All right, thanks, buddy. Bye.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.760
-Mom, we have to hurry.
-Wait, wait, wait.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.720
-Get the rest of your costume, please.
-Oh!

03:42.805 --> 03:45.600
So, tell me more about Robert.

03:45.683 --> 03:49.062
Oh, Robert had a little conflict today.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.814
He's at the lake with his new girlfriend.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.733
See? Just a little conflict.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.776
Mom, my antenna.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.402
Oh.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.656
Hmm.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.617
Oh, you know what? Here. Mm-hmm.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.369
-That'll keep.
-Okay, come on.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.247
-Come on.
-Ella!

04:07.330 --> 04:10.333
Ella! We're going to get there.
It's going to be okay.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.751
Okay. Thank you.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.003
I will. We're going to be fine.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.880
We still have like 25 minutes.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.007
That's not enough time. Come on.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.384
Ahh! Ella!

04:20.635 --> 04:23.805
Well, the gnome is not where it was.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.516
Yes, uh, I get that,

04:26.599 --> 04:30.144
but you can't just accuse
your neighbor without proof.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.356
He's been eyeing it
since the day I got it.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.484
Look, it's a vintage Heissner.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.111
-Oh.
-I just know he took it.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.198
Okay, but just knowing and proving
are two different things.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.576
Incontrovertible proof
is the basis of our legal system.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.872
If you get some proof,
just give me a call at my firm. Okay?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.207
And we'll see what we can do.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.293
Wait. Here.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.711
Take it.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.547
Happy Fourth!

05:00.008 --> 05:03.219
Well, we've accomplished
some amazing legal work today.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
Oh yeah.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.098
-It's time for vegan hot dogs.
-Stop. Stay.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.350
We're just getting started.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.813
Come on, Tom. Look at all the fun
people are having out there.

05:13.896 --> 05:18.067
Cute guys for me, cute gals for you.
We should be mingling.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.445
You're not supposed to work on a holiday.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.739
You get paid for work.
This is volunteering.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.617
This is you volunteering
and me getting wrangled-in, as usual.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.954
-That's the spirit.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.873
Oh! Hi, Marissa.

05:31.956 --> 05:32.999
Hi, guys.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.418
Um, is the show still on schedule?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.920
I think so.
We'll probably go on at around 12:30.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.257
Okay, thanks. "Bee" awesome!

05:41.341 --> 05:42.592
Thanks, Mom.

05:43.801 --> 05:44.761
Everyone ready?

05:44.844 --> 05:47.472
Let's go run the dance a few times
before we go on.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.850
Stay together.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.733
The kids want to go play on the slide.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.613
-Hey, happy Fourth of July.
-Oh, happy Fourth of July.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.700
Marissa?

06:11.871 --> 06:12.747
Mom?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.209
Oh, no.

06:32.850 --> 06:33.684
Tom.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.316
Hi.

06:41.109 --> 06:41.943
Are you okay?

06:42.777 --> 06:44.320
I can't find my mom.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.989
Oh, well,
I could try to help you find her.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.410
Um, she's not dressed
like a bumblebee too, is she?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.746
No, just like a regular person.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.331
Right. Um…

06:56.124 --> 06:58.334
All right, well, I have a booth here,

06:58.418 --> 07:01.129
so why don't we just get out
of that crowd for a second, yeah?

07:01.212 --> 07:04.006
You're not, like,
gonna offer me candy, right?

07:04.090 --> 07:05.508
No.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.053
-I mean, I wouldn't mind some candy.
-Okay.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.180
-No, Tom.
-What?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.474
We're not suing any parents
for a later bedtime.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.644
No, she doesn't need legal advice.
She needs a lost mom.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.855
I'm gonna go see
if there's like a lost kid booth.

07:18.938 --> 07:19.772
-I'll go.
-What?

07:19.856 --> 07:23.401
-You stay here in case her mom comes back.
-You're not going to get a hot dog, right?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.236
Please, Tom.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.571
I might get a lemonade too.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.365
Hey, well, have them
make an announcement if you can't find…

07:31.284 --> 07:33.870
We'll just wait here until he comes back,
I guess, all right?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.705
-I'm Tom.
-I know.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.833
-You're not going to sting me, are you?
-I don't have a stinger.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.168
Oh, thank goodness.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.545
My dance studio is performing.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.630
Oh, yeah. Why don't I just take you there?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.967
-I don't know where they went.
-Oh, not to the stage?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.218
Not until later.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.803
Okay.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.056
Um, let's just wait
and see what Assan can find out.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.100
Um, what happened here?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.394
-It broke somehow.
-Let me see.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.774
I mean, how hard is it

08:03.858 --> 08:07.153
to say that you're going to do something
and then actually do it?

08:07.236 --> 08:10.239
Oh, you know, that's not exactly
a part of Robert's operating system, so--

08:10.323 --> 08:11.991
Never was.

08:12.074 --> 08:12.909
Mm.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.582
Hold this.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.105
-Hello?
-Hi.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.315
Uh…

08:44.982 --> 08:48.236
-Do you need legal advice?
-I do not, but you might.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.237
I'm sorry?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.447
-Why is my daughter in your booth?
-Mom!

08:51.531 --> 08:53.449
-This is your daughter?
-Yeah, pretty sure.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.284
Are you okay?

08:55.368 --> 08:58.204
-I got lost.
-She was just wandering around, and…

08:58.746 --> 09:02.291
His friend went to go look for you,
and he fixed my headband.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.836
Oh.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.715
Okay, well, that was very nice of you.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.717
I'm just glad you're both back together.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.555
We should probably go find Marissa.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.015
Do you want to go see my dance?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.767
Oh, um…

09:20.518 --> 09:21.644
Uh…

09:24.480 --> 09:27.191
They go on at 12:30,
I mean, if you're free.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.362
Uh, yes, I would love
to come see your dance.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.782
-Cool.
-Okay. Well, thanks.

09:34.865 --> 09:35.908
-Sure.
-Mm-hmm.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.786
That was weird.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.163
Yeah, cute guy stole your kid.
What are the odds?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.127
-There was nobody there.
-Nobody where?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.170
The hot dog stand or the lost and found?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.382
They were right next to each other.
Buck 99.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.177
Tom, you lost the kid!

10:09.775 --> 10:11.235
Yay! Ella!

10:11.319 --> 10:13.070
Whoo!

10:14.488 --> 10:15.698
Thank you, everyone.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.831
Did you lose another child?

10:24.915 --> 10:25.750
No.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.422
Well, if you're looking for the booth guy,
he's right over there.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.301
He came.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.427
Mm-hmm.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.512
You should go, uh, thank him.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.097
I already did.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.390
You should go thank him again.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.602
And this time
do a little hair flip or two.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.772
-Ella's coming.
-I've got Ella. You go.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.192
Go.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.027
Go.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.487
Hair flip.

10:54.987 --> 10:55.821
Yes.

10:57.990 --> 10:58.824
That's cute.

11:00.159 --> 11:00.993
Sure.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.788
You came.

11:03.871 --> 11:07.667
Yeah, I mean, I said I was going to come,
so I couldn't just not show up.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.502
Right.

11:10.461 --> 11:14.423
I wanted to properly thank you again
for taking care of my daughter.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.133
-Yeah.
-It was really nice of you.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.136
And I'm sorry
if I thought you were a creep.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.054
I get it.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.223
There's a lot of child abduction booths
this year.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.933
-It's weird.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.686
So, um, what was your booth for again?

11:26.769 --> 11:29.105
It was free legal advice. I'm a lawyer.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.356
So you are a creep.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.361
No, I'm one of those rare good lawyers.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.197
I'm Tom.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.491
Lisa.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.159
What do you do, Lisa?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.119
Uh, I'm a writer.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.746
Mom, come on!

11:45.830 --> 11:47.915
Oh, are you guys going
to stay for the fireworks?

11:47.998 --> 11:49.083
Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.502
-I know a great place to watch them from.
-We usually go to--

11:51.585 --> 11:53.045
Windy Saddle Lookout.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.005
Huh.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.720
I'm surprised that we haven't
seen each other there before.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.764
Maybe we didn't know
what we were looking for.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.812
Ooh!

12:16.694 --> 12:18.320
-Oh, that's purple.
-That was a good one.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.531
-I liked that that one's purple.
-Mm-hmm.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.326
So…

12:27.121 --> 12:29.206
Do you have a favorite restaurant?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.292
Yes.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.002
I said yes,

12:33.085 --> 12:35.296
and that's what brought me to Denver.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.047
Well, I'm glad you're here.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.132
Oh.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.218
I guess someone's
trying to give us a hint.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.539
-Trick or treat!
-Trick or treat!

13:14.960 --> 13:16.378
Ella, slow down!

13:20.591 --> 13:21.509
You missed.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.650
There you are.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.027
Aw.

13:40.986 --> 13:41.862
I love you.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.155
I love you too.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.824
-Mm.
-Mm.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.826
I love you too.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.994
Oh.

13:49.078 --> 13:49.954
Oh.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.040
-Good night.
-Good night.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.221
Five months already.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.475
I don't think
I've ever seen you this happy before.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.894
It has been pretty magical.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.565
Mm-hmm. And oh, God,
Ella loves Tom so much.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.692
-I know, right?
-Mm-hmm.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.443
So what am I not seeing?

14:21.527 --> 14:22.528
What do you mean?

14:22.611 --> 14:25.489
Well, he can't be this perfect,
so what am I missing?

14:25.573 --> 14:26.448
Uh-uh, Lis.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.702
I am not going to let you
talk yourself out of this love story.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.328
I mean, what could possibly go wrong?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.496
Oh! God!

14:36.500 --> 14:39.920
Whoa! Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Are you okay?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.339
Yeah, I… I…
It just surprised me, that's all.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.092
You can never
go too big on Christmas, right?

14:45.885 --> 14:46.844
Hmm.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.137
Yeah. Come on, girl.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.264
-Right. Thank you.
-I got you.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.224
Merry Christmas.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.269
Maybe I should put that
in my Christmas article.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.314
Wait, Grant has you writing an article
about Christmas?

14:59.481 --> 15:00.566
Oh, boy.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.027
I can't wait to see how that turns out.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.659
Oh. That's sweet.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.705
Hi. Assan.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.999
Is everything okay?

15:17.082 --> 15:20.669
Absolutely, ladies.
Here, let me take your coats.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.795
Okay.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.882
We're going to get these back, right?

15:24.965 --> 15:27.384
Of course.
Tom just wants you to be comfortable.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.720
Oh, okay.
Well, you're scaring me a little.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.140
-You have no idea.
-What does that mean?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.267
Welcome to Christmas.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.609
Are we in the right place?

16:14.264 --> 16:16.558
Hey. Sorry, guys.
I was running late. Welcome.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.811
<i>-Ho, ho, ho, ho!</i>

16:19.561 --> 16:21.939
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

16:22.022 --> 16:23.232
-Hi, Sharon.
-Hi.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.900
Hi. Merry Christmas.

16:24.984 --> 16:30.197
Yeah, um, what is going on?
Is this for real?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.574
It's for real, every bit of it.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.868
Yeah, whatever contest you entered,
you won it.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.330
No, it's just to celebrate the season.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.250
Hmm.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.129
-Show them the photo wall.
-Oh, yeah, come this way.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.261
Yeah, I got this whole setup here.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.015
We thought we could do some poses
with, like, props and things,

16:56.098 --> 16:57.474
and Santa himself.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.685
Okay, #NorthPoleFever.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.814
Are you guys pranking me?

17:03.897 --> 17:05.441
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

17:05.524 --> 17:07.317
Sharon, are you in on this?

17:07.401 --> 17:08.527
Don't look at me.

17:09.611 --> 17:10.654
You don't like it?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.866
I kind of famously don't like it.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.492
Have we not talked about this?

17:15.576 --> 17:18.871
No, that's-- That's something
I would have remembered you saying.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.957
You do this every year?

17:22.041 --> 17:22.875
Yeah.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.710
But who's it for?

17:24.793 --> 17:29.089
Me. And you guys tonight.
I mean, mostly just 'cause it's Christmas.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.551
And as a reminder
to keep the spirit of the season alive.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.095
Couldn't you just put a Post-It note
on the fridge?

17:36.930 --> 17:39.683
Think of this as one massive Post-It note.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.061
Okay, but isn't it expensive?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.729
No.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.566
Yeah. If you added everything up,
I guess it's a lot of money.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.319
But I've had most of this stuff
since I was a kid.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.404
I don't buy all-new decorations
every year.

17:52.488 --> 17:56.241
Yeah, but it's still
Christmas-moving merchandise.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.287
I mean, would anybody
ever have a nutcracker

18:00.370 --> 18:02.581
or a stuffed reindeer
if it wasn't for Christmas?

18:02.664 --> 18:05.959
No, but you don't need
to spend money to decorate, right?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.629
I have a bunch
of homemade decorating ideas.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.631
Right? It's just about the spirit.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.926
Is this the work project
you had this weekend?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.552
Yeah. I mean, this was the fun part.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.014
The hard part was getting my work stuff
organized and up to the office.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.726
Why didn't you just tell me?

18:23.727 --> 18:25.521
I wanted to surprise you.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.817
Well, you did.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.079
I put the whole train together.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.456
Hmm. I hope Tom gave you a sticker.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.586
Now wait, it's not just decorations,
all right?

18:49.670 --> 18:52.714
Christmastime is also
about all the different holiday events.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.093
There are so many things
going on around town. Here, look.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.013
I am sure you guys
have been to some of them.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.598
I've been to all of them.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.145
I mean, there's tree lighting,
Christmas carol singing,

19:06.228 --> 19:07.479
holiday productions.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.941
It's fun just to walk around town
and take in Christmas energy.

19:11.024 --> 19:11.900
Is it?

19:11.984 --> 19:15.070
Okay, look, I get it.
You don't like Christmas.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.240
But let me show you how fun it can be.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.535
Well, I guess Ella
will enjoy a couple of these.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.452
Oh.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.706
So is Ella with her dad tonight?

19:25.789 --> 19:29.835
Yep, they have a big cardboard
sledding competition coming up.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.421
I bet I know what the key is. Duct tape.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.340
-What? Duct tape?
-You know what they say?

19:35.424 --> 19:40.012
If duct tape can't solve your problem,
you're not using enough duct tape.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.598
-Oh, I will pass that along.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.184
Oh! But wait, there's more.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.560
Ah, more food?

19:46.643 --> 19:47.686
-Yeah.
-Oh, boy.

19:47.769 --> 19:49.605
Anyone for pumpkin pie?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.691
-I'll find room.
-I will too.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.109
Move over, rice balls.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.195
Thank you.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.530
-Bye.
-Bye.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.991
-Are you here for Pasha?
-Yeah. I'm Lisa.

20:04.786 --> 20:08.707
So, Lisa, not a fan of Christmas.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.292
I sensed that.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.295
Well, if she survives it, anyway.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.213
Hmm.

20:14.922 --> 20:19.009
-I noticed you didn't mention Santa.
-Oh, that's not a hill I'm ready to climb.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.388
Maybe I can get her to like it.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.350
What the-- Are you okay?

20:26.433 --> 20:29.436
Yes, we're fine. Sorry about that.
Just keep driving.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.896
She's just working some things out.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.732
My boyfriend loves Christmas.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.610
-My boyfriend.
-Yeah, did not see that coming.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.195
What I supposed to do now?

20:38.278 --> 20:41.031
Just break up
and then get back together in January?

20:41.114 --> 20:44.868
You and Tom are like the dream couple.
You can handle a bit of Christmas fun.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.995
Oh, that was not fun.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.872
That was weird.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.375
I mean, all the decorations,
all that time.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.711
He took three straight days
to do that place.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.755
Well, we know that Tom
can get hyper-focused.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.090
That's the lawyer side of him.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.759
And the guy who never has time
to do stuff on the weekdays

21:00.842 --> 21:03.303
now has all this time
to do Christmas stuff?

21:03.387 --> 21:04.554
That's the beauty of it.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.765
And all that stuff
that he was talking about at dinner,

21:06.848 --> 21:09.268
and the sleigh rides,
and the Christmas movies, whatever,

21:09.893 --> 21:12.521
you're going to get
to see each other every single day.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.108
To celebrate Christmas.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.859
Yeah, well, that's the challenge.

21:17.943 --> 21:22.197
And I know just how we're gonna
have you jump right into the deep end.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.448
Give me your phone.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
Give me your phone.

21:26.868 --> 21:27.703
Thank you.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.538
Yes!

21:32.040 --> 21:34.418
Oh, I'm good.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.589
Yeah, thanks for the help, Spielberg.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.466
I did the train.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.343
-Yeah.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.138
That's Lisa.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.224
Oh. Sorry, buddy.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.226
You guys had a good run.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.148
No, she wants me to show her
some of my homemade decorating ideas.

21:57.774 --> 22:01.236
"Tomorrow with Ella after school.
I want to give Christmas a chance."

22:02.863 --> 22:05.699
Huh. That is not the vibe
I got as they were leaving.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.951
Well, that's the Christmas magic at work.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.121
All right, I got to go to my storage unit
in the morning,

22:11.204 --> 22:13.874
pick up my backup ornaments.
I can use those for her tree,

22:13.957 --> 22:16.501
because that is still technically
not spending any money.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.544
You got work tomorrow.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.963
I can call in sick.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.050
You're gonna call in sick?

22:23.133 --> 22:25.093
Yeah, why? Wait, how do you call in sick?

22:25.594 --> 22:26.803
Do you call the nurse's office?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.680
Do we have a nurse's office
at my law firm?

22:28.764 --> 22:29.890
Call your assistant.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.350
Yes. I'm gonna call my assistant.

22:31.975 --> 22:32.893
-Tom.
-Yes?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.519
-Take a breath here.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.396
-Bigger.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.192
Just write back to Lisa.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.361
Oh, right. Yes.

22:43.111 --> 22:44.529
Writing back to…

22:46.865 --> 22:47.783
Okay.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.204
Well?

22:53.121 --> 22:55.540
He's in for tomorrow.

22:56.041 --> 22:56.917
A Monday.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.210
Tomorrow night?

22:58.293 --> 22:59.753
-All day.
-Ah!

23:00.796 --> 23:02.547
-Hallelujah!
-You girls scream too much.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.342
But Pasha, it's Christmas.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.959
-Hey.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.085
T-Tom.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.504
Lisa, you're leaving?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.090
I thought you were coming at 11:00.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.926
Sorry, I was up,
and then the storage place was open,

23:48.009 --> 23:50.762
and I got moving,
and I thought if you were up early…

23:50.846 --> 23:52.472
I have to go into the office.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.974
You're not working from home today?

23:54.474 --> 23:55.767
We have a staff meeting.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.647
Are we going to use all of that?

24:02.441 --> 24:05.902
Um, there's two more crates by the car.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.950
Are you gonna be okay here by yourself?

24:12.033 --> 24:13.410
Oh, absolutely. Yes.

24:13.493 --> 24:17.080
No, I still need to go through
all these backup ornaments that I got.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.249
-And do you have any ornaments?
-Oh. Yeah.

24:19.332 --> 24:22.335
-We should see how many we have total.
-That's my Christmas box right there.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.297
Great. I will go through the box
and the ornaments.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.090
You go to work. Don't worry about it.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.136
-All right. There is some coffee left.
-Do you have cocoa?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.681
-Since when do you drink hot chocolate?
-Cocoa?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.018
That is one of the many joys of Christmas.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.563
Oh, okay. No, I don't have cocoa.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.856
I will grab some.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.065
-Okay.
-Okay.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.609
Mwah! Off to work I go.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.776
Off you go.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.199
Mm-hmm.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.868
We need more clicks.
We're not-- Nobody's opening us up.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.537
And if nobody opens us up,
then we don't come to work.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.414
So we want them to see something

24:59.498 --> 25:02.125
that makes them want to stay there
and then go to the next thing.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.419
-Lisa, you with us
Yup. Yes, Grant.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.964
Great. So we got to come up
with some new ideas.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.222
More spitballing different ideas.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.850
Somebody threw out something
about this hipsters' climbers club.

25:21.102 --> 25:23.980
I mean, and what the hell,
Glenn's obsession with ASMR.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.482
I don't even know what that's about.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.151
I'm glad he didn't come in today.
I was going to--

25:28.235 --> 25:29.361
<i>Christmas.</i>

25:29.861 --> 25:31.571
<i>One man's obsession,</i>

25:32.405 --> 25:33.949
<i>one woman's nightmare.</i>

25:35.075 --> 25:36.993
Ta-da! Cocoa.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.954
Wow, that's fancy.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.874
I put the tiniest little bit of nutmeg
in it to give it a kick.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.877
-I have nutmeg?
-I grabbed a whole one while I was out.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.171
You gotta grind it fresh
or it loses its flavor.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.839
-Oh, is that, right?
-That is right.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.759
Well, it's not your mom's hot chocolate.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.762
Oh, no, no. It is cocoa.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.518
-Mmm. Wow.
-Oh!

26:01.601 --> 26:04.604
-That is delicious.
-Okay. Okay.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.398
Can I show you what I've been up to?

26:06.481 --> 26:07.983
-Yeah, lead the way.
-Come on.

26:08.066 --> 26:08.984
So…

26:10.527 --> 26:12.487
ornaments all ready to hang.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.155
Had to add a hook to a few of them.

26:14.239 --> 26:17.492
And the lights.
I checked all the strands for dead bulbs.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.244
-You don't want any surprises there.
-Good.

26:19.327 --> 26:23.164
Oh, and then a tree, I thought I could
clear a spot right here in the corner.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.208
-Yeah.
-Right? All right. Come here.

26:27.168 --> 26:31.590
And project station,
ready to make decorations by hand.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.634
You've been busy.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.677
It's fun.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.512
Everything good at work?

26:38.847 --> 26:41.683
Yeah, I got an article
that's giving me a little trouble.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.601
Oh.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.644
You know what?
Ella's out of school at 3:00.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.688
-Should we get some lunch?
-Yeah. Perfect.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.231
Finish your cocoa and we'll head out.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.013
So you never had any fun
with your family at Christmas?

27:20.597 --> 27:24.309
Hmm. My parents
never really had fun, ever.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.230
Maybe it's because none of them
was wearing this.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.376
-No. Mm-mm.
-Jingle?

27:49.459 --> 27:52.712
This is pretty great.
Look at this. For me.

27:56.007 --> 27:59.469
Oh. And I know a place
that does Christmas cupcakes,

27:59.552 --> 28:01.012
where they take the icing…

28:01.096 --> 28:05.141
Here, sorry, just walk on this side.
It's a pretty dangerous neighborhood.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.644
-Get him!
-Whoa! Get back.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.230
Duck! All right, go!

28:10.313 --> 28:12.107
Go, go, go, go, go!

28:12.190 --> 28:14.025
Ha-ha! Not today, Freckles!

28:16.611 --> 28:19.406
So, have you thought
about your Christmas list for Santa?

28:19.906 --> 28:21.533
I have a few ideas.

28:21.616 --> 28:22.575
Like what?

28:22.659 --> 28:24.452
-An iPhone.
-Ha.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.164
Oh, I don't think that the elves
have iPhone technology.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.916
They can make an iPhone.

28:29.999 --> 28:33.628
Uh, I'm pretty sure
they don't make iPhones at the North Pole.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.964
They can make anything you want
at the North Pole.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.051
Oh, um, Tom, go with me here.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.304
I heard there's an age limit for iPhones.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.764
Santa said it was 11.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.558
Eleven?

28:46.641 --> 28:51.187
Oh, um, Santa doesn't bring presents
to kids older than 10.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.899
Not the point, Tom.

28:55.692 --> 28:59.696
I heard that he thinks eight
is too young for an iPhone.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.157
Oh, yes, right.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.368
Well, your mom is right.
Santa knows everything about you,

29:05.452 --> 29:07.871
and he can't bring you a present
that you're not ready for.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.707
Fine.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.002
Fine. All right, come on.
Let's get a tree. Let's go.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.673
You want a tree for your house
that's about six feet tall.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.342
So I'm going to say that's these here.

29:22.469 --> 29:25.597
So this is our first possibility.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.932
Now I just need an inspector
to walk around

29:28.016 --> 29:29.601
and make sure there's no dead spots.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.727
On it.

29:30.810 --> 29:31.853
-Okay.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.105
Check that back.
That's how they get you sometimes.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.190
Branches look good.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.151
It's perfect.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.945
-Then we have picked our tree.
-I love it.

29:41.029 --> 29:44.866
But wait, it's not done yet.
You guys ever been flocked?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.751
Who knew?

29:54.834 --> 29:56.085
That is so cool.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.171
What else can we flock?

29:59.380 --> 30:00.673
Just the tree today.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.676
All right,
we have to leave it here overnight to dry,

30:03.760 --> 30:06.262
but we can go get
all of our ornaments ready

30:06.346 --> 30:07.722
so we can decorate it tomorrow.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.182
Yeah? All right. Come on.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.072
Look at that!

30:47.595 --> 30:51.224
Oh, there it is. That's it.

30:51.307 --> 30:54.018
"The Grinch had been caught
by this little Who daughter

30:54.102 --> 30:57.272
who'd gotten out of bed
for a cup of cold water."

30:57.355 --> 30:59.899
"And she looked at the Grinch and said…"

30:59.983 --> 31:01.860
"Santa Claus, why?"

31:01.943 --> 31:05.446
"Why are you taking
my Christmas tree? Why?"

31:06.072 --> 31:10.243
"But you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick."

31:10.326 --> 31:13.288
<i>"He thought up a lie,</i>
<i>and he thought it up quick."</i>

31:13.872 --> 31:16.416
<i>"Why, my sweet little tot…"</i>

31:21.296 --> 31:23.006
Merry Christmas.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.257
Merry Christmas.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.682
That was quite a day.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.352
Did you like it?

31:37.770 --> 31:40.023
I have to admit I did.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.024
Yeah?

31:41.107 --> 31:43.943
Yeah. But mostly because we were together,

31:44.444 --> 31:46.613
and we always have fun
when we're together.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.325
Yeah, but Christmas makes it more magical.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.244
Christmas made it happen on a Monday.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.455
-Right.

31:55.955 --> 32:00.543
Oh, hey, there is, um,
one more thing that I made

32:00.627 --> 32:02.086
that I haven't shown you yet.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.005
Oh, boy. What else?

32:06.341 --> 32:07.175
This.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.427
Huh.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.055
What is it? Cilantro?

32:12.138 --> 32:14.891
Mm-mm. This is mistletoe.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.726
Oh. I've heard of it.

32:16.809 --> 32:17.644
Mm-hmm.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.314
-We supposed to do something?
-Mm-hmm.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.820
It is a merry Christmas.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.546
That came in after I left,
so no, I did not do that.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.050
Okay, just put it on my desk.
I'm gonna take a look in the morning.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.888
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

33:00.103 --> 33:03.523
<i>Don't forget to leave</i>
<i>a carrot for Rudolph.</i>

33:07.694 --> 33:08.569
Flock yeah.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.863
It's so pretty.

33:10.947 --> 33:11.823
Right?

33:11.906 --> 33:14.200
-Oh, Tom, your coat.
-Yeah?

33:14.784 --> 33:17.286
Ew! Looks like I've been flocked.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.666
Last one. That was the last one, promise.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.086
-Come on in.
-Okay.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.256
I don't need any help. Wow. No. I got it.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.010
Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.931
This was me when I was, like, your age.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.767
What happened to your hair?

33:41.310 --> 33:43.312
That's when I still let Nana Joy cut it.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.443
Oh. That's cute.

33:57.618 --> 33:58.870
Is Santa Claus is real?

33:59.454 --> 34:01.789
What? Of course, he is.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.750
This boy at school says he's not,

34:03.833 --> 34:06.669
that it's just your parents
buying you presents.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.463
Why does he think that?

34:09.130 --> 34:10.506
His brother told him.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.050
Oh. Brothers.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.302
What's this boy's name?

34:15.136 --> 34:15.970
Connor.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.473
All right, well,
let's say that you're Santa

34:18.556 --> 34:20.266
and Connor doesn't believe in you.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.018
Would you want to bring him something?

34:22.769 --> 34:25.521
How could he not believe in me?
I'm a real person.

34:25.605 --> 34:30.443
Yeah. Well, so is Santa, all right?
So if Connor doesn't believe in Santa,

34:30.526 --> 34:32.320
is Santa gonna want
to bring him a present?

34:34.489 --> 34:37.492
-I guess not.
-Yeah, so that's a problem for Connor.

34:37.575 --> 34:39.827
But that is not a problem for you.

34:40.787 --> 34:41.913
Not as long as you believe.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.002
I'll make a list just to be safe.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.796
I think that's a great idea.

34:55.968 --> 34:59.013
Ready? Three, two, one.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.266
I love it.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.229
That's the prettiest tree we've ever had.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.690
Ooh. She's out.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.607
Ah.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.656
Me?

36:03.369 --> 36:04.287
Are you okay?

36:05.288 --> 36:06.289
Writer's block.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.167
You spent all week celebrating Christmas

36:09.250 --> 36:11.043
and you still can't figure out
what to write?

36:12.044 --> 36:13.838
I'm more confused than ever.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.131
Hmm.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.049
We spent a week
doing all these fun things,

36:17.133 --> 36:21.179
but why does this one holiday
have to be so freaking important?

36:23.723 --> 36:25.641
-Lisa.
-Yes, Grant?

36:25.725 --> 36:27.059
Christmas article.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.854
Oh, just trying to get it perfect, boss.

36:29.937 --> 36:33.065
Well, Santa Claus is coming to town,
and I got ads to sell.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.568
Cha-ching. Let's have it.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.527
You got it.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.866
And that's why he has resting Grinch face.

36:46.621 --> 36:50.625
So then Ella asked
how Scrooge died but didn't die.

36:50.708 --> 36:54.086
She may have missed a few plot points,
but I think she got the idea.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.463
No, she loved it.

36:55.546 --> 36:57.340
-Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, that's awesome.

36:57.924 --> 36:58.883
No offense, Tom,

36:58.966 --> 37:02.136
but I was ready for a year off
from <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

37:02.220 --> 37:04.639
-Oh, offense taken.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.767
On behalf of me and Ebenezer.
He's very sensitive.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.768
I'm sorry.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.687
This whole week has been
super eye-opening.

37:11.771 --> 37:16.192
Oh, look at you, getting your Santa on.
Okay, I'm proud of you.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.652
-Thank you.

37:17.735 --> 37:18.986
Oh my gosh, and Tom,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.072
thank you for talking
to Ella about Santa Claus.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.241
I always dread that conversation.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.242
How come?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.120
Well, I don't want to rob her
of the fun of believing in Santa,

37:28.204 --> 37:30.081
but I feel bad lying to her

37:30.164 --> 37:32.124
and I don't want her
to get teased at school

37:32.208 --> 37:33.834
for still believing.

37:33.918 --> 37:36.295
Oh my God. I got teased
so bad in the third grade.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.340
There was this uppity rich girl,
Jennifer Alerdese,

37:39.423 --> 37:40.967
who controlled the whole class.

37:41.050 --> 37:43.886
So when she stopped believing,
everybody else had to too.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.555
I was the lone holdout that Christmas.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.682
So tragic.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.434
Oh, poor little baby Sharon. I'm sorry.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.936
I know, right? Oh God.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.235
But what if he is real?

37:59.318 --> 38:00.319
Who? Santa?

38:02.822 --> 38:05.283
Yeah, what if the believers are right

38:05.366 --> 38:07.118
and the doubters are wrong?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.496
-Like in third grade?
-No, like always.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.208
That Santa Claus is real?

38:16.794 --> 38:17.628
Yeah.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.673
Shut up.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.259
No, for real.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.052
Tom.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.638
Uh-oh.

38:27.722 --> 38:32.601
Okay, so you think that there's a real guy
who travels around the world in one night

38:32.685 --> 38:34.603
and brings presents to everybody?

38:34.687 --> 38:36.939
Well, just to children, but yes.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.860
You can't be serious.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.904
You believe that there's a guy
who lives in the North Pole

38:43.988 --> 38:46.032
and has elves making toys.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.658
Yep. All that.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.746
But that's not possible, Tom.

38:51.829 --> 38:56.375
That's why kids stop believing,
because they start to understand the logic

38:56.459 --> 38:58.419
and it doesn't make sense.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.881
It's not about logic. It's about magic.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.551
Oh, so you think that magic is real?

39:05.634 --> 39:08.179
Christmas magic. Yeah.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.854
Okay, let's just go with it.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.481
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:18.564 --> 39:22.485
So you believe that this guy has a sleigh

39:22.568 --> 39:23.986
and it's pulled by reindeer.

39:24.070 --> 39:24.945
Yes.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.197
Reindeer can fly?

39:26.280 --> 39:28.324
Yes, through Christmas magic.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.743
And he has a sack
that's full of millions of toys?

39:30.826 --> 39:31.952
Yes, he does.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.914
-Because of Christmas magic.
-Couldn't happen without it.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.005
I just really can't tell
if you're being serious or not.

39:43.756 --> 39:48.469
Okay, how does he get around
the entire world in one night?

39:49.011 --> 39:51.764
And don't just say "Christmas magic."

39:53.307 --> 39:54.433
That's part of it, though.

39:54.517 --> 39:58.979
But also, he obviously lives
in a different version of time than we do.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.732
-What's that now?
-Well, think about it.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.026
He can get around the world in one night.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.986
He lives longer than any other person.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.572
That's just about the concept of time.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.409
He lives in one model of time
and we live in another.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.413
I thought you were the guy
who makes a living dealing in rules

40:15.496 --> 40:17.081
and proof and logic.

40:17.164 --> 40:20.501
Yes. Let's talk logic, right?
Let's look at it from your side.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.963
What you're saying is
there's a completely made-up story

40:24.046 --> 40:27.091
that over 2 billion people agree on?

40:27.174 --> 40:29.051
And that every parent in America

40:29.135 --> 40:33.305
is part of some
vast conspiracy to perpetuate a lie,

40:33.931 --> 40:35.975
but the exact same lie.

40:36.058 --> 40:38.352
All right, that seems a lot less logical

40:38.436 --> 40:42.273
than there's a real person
with Christmas magic that we celebrate.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.650
Yeah, but not everybody
celebrates Christmas.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.902
In most of the world, they do.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.239
Assan, you're a Muslim.
Do you have something to add here?

40:50.322 --> 40:53.409
I fought this fight years ago.
You're on your own.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.163
-Assan celebrates Christmas.
-Oh, I'm pretty sure he doesn't.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.249
He doesn't celebrate Christmas
as a religious holiday.

41:00.332 --> 41:03.335
I'm talking about Santa's Christmas.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.129
All right, when you find yourself

41:05.212 --> 41:07.715
humming along
to a Christmas carol on the radio,

41:08.382 --> 41:10.217
you're celebrating Christmas.

41:10.301 --> 41:14.013
When you go to a holiday party
or make plans to see family,

41:14.096 --> 41:15.389
you're celebrating Christmas.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.476
Those are just holiday things
that we can't escape.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.395
I mean, "escape" suggests
that we're all trapped somehow.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.773
But we're not.
We look forward to Christmas every year.

41:25.608 --> 41:29.028
It's the one thing
that brings everybody together.

41:29.111 --> 41:33.616
And you're trying to tell me
that a unifying energy like that,

41:33.699 --> 41:37.620
a global presence
that transcends country and religion

41:37.703 --> 41:39.788
isn't because of a real person?

41:42.166 --> 41:48.380
Well, I think Santa
as a spirit of Christmas is real,

41:48.464 --> 41:50.799
-like you obviously do.
-I do, yes.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.177
But I'm not making a joke.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.096
I believe in Santa Claus.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.060
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, she'll be fine.

42:01.143 --> 42:03.062
Don't worry about her. Just keep driving.

42:03.145 --> 42:05.314
Okay, we're fine. Go ahead. Drive.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.859
My boyfriend believes in Santa Claus.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.487
My wife believes in astrology.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.280
-Not talking to you.
-Sorry.

42:14.657 --> 42:15.699
Gemini.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.284
This is totally insane.

42:18.035 --> 42:21.080
Okay, I mean,
he did make some good points in there.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.623
It makes you think.

42:22.706 --> 42:26.919
No, no, Sharon, not you too.
You want me just to be okay with this?

42:27.002 --> 42:29.421
Well, you said yourself
that you had a great week with Tom.

42:29.505 --> 42:32.091
Yeah, with Tom and Santa.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.175
And Ella.

42:33.676 --> 42:37.972
Oh God, now I have two people
to convince that Santa isn't real.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.560
She didn't storm out.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.187
She didn't like it, though.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.775
No one likes it, Tom.

42:50.609 --> 42:51.986
That's hoping for too much.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.446
I thought you liked it.

42:54.530 --> 42:58.784
I like you, buddy.
The whole Santa thing is…whatever.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.370
So you think I'm crazy, too.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.497
No, I didn't say that.

43:04.957 --> 43:08.460
Look, if we'll never really know
if Santa is real,

43:08.544 --> 43:13.048
then I'm happy to believe with you,
for you, for us being friends.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.552
I don't have the same conviction you do

43:16.635 --> 43:19.471
because it's not that important to me
either way.

43:20.848 --> 43:24.393
So what do I do? I have the tree lighting
on the schedule for Monday.

43:25.144 --> 43:28.022
Well, sometimes
you have to adjust your schedule

43:28.105 --> 43:29.815
to consider other people's needs.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.027
You want to write
a killer article about Christmas?

43:33.652 --> 43:36.280
I think you just found your in.

43:37.323 --> 43:39.283
No, I don't think I can take it.

43:39.366 --> 43:41.660
No, don't run away. Go deeper.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.579
There's so much more to unpack here.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.749
This is better than an article
that writes itself.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.626
It can be written by Santa.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.211
-Bottom line is, you love her.
-I do.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.672
-And she loves you.
-I hope.

43:54.173 --> 43:57.301
So then have some faith
that she'll accept you for who you are.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.802
I will try to have some faith.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.471
-All right.
-Yes. Thank you.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.514
Hey, that's what elves are for.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.099
Yeah. You're the best.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.145
-Good night.
-Night.

45:14.503 --> 45:17.548
So how does the tree lighting
figure into Christmas magic?

45:17.631 --> 45:19.717
Oh, we have to keep
the Christmas spirit alive.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.885
That's where Christmas magic comes from.

45:21.969 --> 45:23.929
By putting lights on a tree?

45:25.013 --> 45:28.225
Twinkle lights
are the fireworks of Christmas.

45:28.308 --> 45:32.271
We look at these things every day,
a tree, a house, a lamppost.

45:32.771 --> 45:34.440
But then one month out of the year,

45:34.523 --> 45:38.193
they are covered in a beautiful glow
of color and light,

45:38.277 --> 45:40.738
and we look at our world a whole new way.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.783
It's that childlike wonder
that makes the magic.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.944
-They're so awesome.
-Yeah.

46:21.028 --> 46:25.032
Thank you all for coming out tonight.
I think we should light this sucker up.

46:25.115 --> 46:26.575
-Yeah!
-Hit it, Ben!

46:31.038 --> 46:33.290
Yes! No problem!

46:51.225 --> 46:52.518
Get him!

46:54.144 --> 46:55.020
Ha!

46:59.233 --> 47:00.734
-Retreat!
-You got it!

47:01.235 --> 47:03.278
Yes! Whoo!

47:04.613 --> 47:06.824
Eat it, Freckles!

47:08.242 --> 47:09.117
Yes!

47:13.288 --> 47:14.915
-Okay.

47:14.998 --> 47:17.709
Okay. Look, there's-- Look at the elf.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.504
Ho, ho, ho! Look at Eflie. Ho, ho, ho!

47:20.587 --> 47:23.423
Elfie is so sweet. Oh, look at Elfie.

47:23.507 --> 47:24.675
Oh, no.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.887
Is that kid gonna kill Santa Claus?

47:28.971 --> 47:31.765
She might kill that one,
but the real one will be fine.

47:32.307 --> 47:33.308
Talk to Twinkles.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.518
Hello. Ho, ho, ho.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.311
-Thank you.
-Oh, it's okay.

47:36.395 --> 47:40.774
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.696
Ho, ho. Hello. Come on up. Hi.

47:45.779 --> 47:47.739
-Hi.
-Ho, ho, ho. What's your name?

47:47.823 --> 47:50.033
-I'm Ella.
-Nice to meet you, Bella.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.535
What would you like for Christmas?

47:51.618 --> 47:53.871
I would like an iPhone.

47:53.954 --> 47:55.497
An iPhone. Oh, my!

47:55.581 --> 47:58.250
You know why Santa's
never going to die, Tom?

47:58.333 --> 47:59.293
Why is that?

47:59.918 --> 48:04.256
Because he's the poster child
for spending money at Christmas.

48:04.923 --> 48:07.968
I mean, all of these stores
that sell toys and cards

48:08.051 --> 48:12.180
and Lexuses with big bows on it
aren't going to let their point man go.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.182
-Yeah.
-I mean, not when everyone

48:14.266 --> 48:17.436
is counting presents
to see how happy their Christmas is.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.856
-But what I'd really like is…
-Yeah? What's this?

48:23.525 --> 48:24.359
Oh!

48:24.443 --> 48:26.486
Companies are gonna do
what they're gonna do,

48:26.570 --> 48:31.074
but thinking about that moment,
watching someone open the perfect present

48:31.158 --> 48:32.826
and that look in their eyes.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.536
That is just so awesome.

48:35.078 --> 48:38.457
Yeah, but you don't have to believe
in Santa to gift one another.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.542
Well, no, no, of course not.

48:40.626 --> 48:44.004
Yeah. And shouldn't we be doing that
all year round?

48:44.671 --> 48:45.589
Yes.

48:45.672 --> 48:48.634
The thing about Christmas presents is,
they're always a surprise.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.552
So I can't make any promises, okay?

48:51.386 --> 48:52.638
-You understand? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

48:52.721 --> 48:54.514
Very good. Let's take a picture, okay?

48:54.598 --> 48:56.725
Look at Sprinkles.
Ho, ho! Hello, Sprinkles.

48:56.808 --> 48:58.101
-Ho, ho, ho, ho.

48:58.185 --> 48:59.895
Merry Christmas. Thank you so much.

48:59.978 --> 49:01.813
-Thank you, Santa.
-Thank you, Santa.

49:01.897 --> 49:04.566
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

49:04.650 --> 49:05.651
Hmm.

49:06.985 --> 49:07.986
Thanks, Mom.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.197
Aww.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.325
Okay, so, what did you ask Santa for?

49:13.408 --> 49:14.493
Not gonna tell.

49:15.535 --> 49:16.954
Why?

49:17.037 --> 49:19.164
It's between me and the big man.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.377
Ho, ho, ho!

49:25.295 --> 49:26.922
Okay, next question.

49:28.298 --> 49:33.345
What are Santa's three rules
for making a great garden?

49:33.428 --> 49:35.639
What are Santa's three rules

49:35.722 --> 49:38.183
for making a great garden?

49:39.101 --> 49:39.935
Ooh!

49:40.018 --> 49:43.021
-You already got three?
-Already done. Trust me on this one.

49:43.897 --> 49:44.815
Okay.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.444
If you could see Santa,
that would prove it.

49:49.945 --> 49:52.030
-So have you seen Santa?
-No.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.240
No, you can't.

49:53.323 --> 49:56.201
He's not going to come to your house
if you're up waiting for him,

49:56.284 --> 49:59.121
trying to catch him
like he's trying to rob the place.

49:59.830 --> 50:03.500
But if you can't prove it,
then why believe in him?

50:03.583 --> 50:06.503
It's because you can't prove it
that you have to believe.

50:07.170 --> 50:10.090
It takes faith
to believe in the unknowable.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.718
Okay.

50:14.678 --> 50:15.971
What if you're wrong?

50:17.806 --> 50:22.561
I guess I'd rather be wrong
having faith in something wonderful

50:23.437 --> 50:26.189
than wrong
because I didn't have any faith.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.612
Answer coming through!

50:34.656 --> 50:39.828
The three rules from Santa
for making a great garden:

50:39.911 --> 50:43.665
-ho, ho, ho!

50:44.666 --> 50:46.043
Got it. Got it.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.045
If you said that, you were right.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.338
You got it. Congrats.

50:51.089 --> 50:52.382
Still in the lead.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.730
Next batch, please.

51:11.109 --> 51:12.319
Watch fingers.

51:13.278 --> 51:14.279
Perfect!

51:14.905 --> 51:15.906
Boom.

51:19.701 --> 51:20.952
One more batch?

51:21.036 --> 51:23.288
That was the last batch, honey.

51:23.371 --> 51:24.873
Just one more?

51:24.956 --> 51:27.334
You already did your one more.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.752
You did great, kiddo.

51:28.835 --> 51:29.920
-Here.

51:30.545 --> 51:34.299
Now, go brush your teeth
and I will come and check on you.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.306
Hmm.

51:53.401 --> 51:55.278
How many more batches, Tom?

51:55.362 --> 51:58.031
Uh, let's see,
I got six more ready to go in the oven,

51:58.115 --> 52:00.200
and then about four more?

52:00.784 --> 52:02.494
Enough dough for four more after that.

52:02.577 --> 52:04.162
Oh. Okay.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.582
Just, I got to make sure
I have enough for everyone on my list.

52:07.666 --> 52:09.543
Your list? Right. Yeah.

52:12.546 --> 52:14.840
Hey, did you ever find out
what Ella asked Santa for?

52:16.133 --> 52:18.802
No, she wouldn't tell me,
but if I had to guess,

52:18.885 --> 52:21.763
it starts with an "I"
and ends with a "phone."

52:22.889 --> 52:24.099
Poor thing.

52:24.933 --> 52:27.477
I have all kinds of things
that I think she'll really like.

52:27.561 --> 52:31.189
Yeah, but it's still good
that she let Santa know what she wants.

52:33.608 --> 52:37.696
Santa doesn't bring her any presents.
They come from me and Robert.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.406
Not if she believes.

52:45.620 --> 52:46.454
Um…

52:47.455 --> 52:51.084
Maybe, could you not talk to Ella
about Santa anymore?

52:52.169 --> 52:54.045
I think she's getting the wrong message.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.922
That Santa Claus is real?

52:58.091 --> 53:00.302
Yeah, that message.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.890
So last week when I told her
Santa Claus was real,

53:04.973 --> 53:07.184
you were fine with it
because you thought I was lying.

53:07.267 --> 53:10.061
And now that it's the truth,
you don't like it.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.192
I don't think it's the truth.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.528
Well, don't rob Ella of her belief.

53:18.612 --> 53:21.114
I'm not going to. I mean, not right now.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.365
But there's gonna come a day,

53:22.449 --> 53:24.409
and she's gonna ask,
and I'm gonna tell the truth…

53:24.492 --> 53:27.245
I don't think it's fair for you
to put your lack of faith onto Ella.

53:27.329 --> 53:29.456
Okay, Ella is my daughter, Tom.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.085
Yes, that-- You're right.

53:34.169 --> 53:37.255
I don't really want
to make a big deal out of this.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.507
-I am sorry.
-I just have to protect my kid.

53:42.510 --> 53:43.345
I get it.

53:45.889 --> 53:49.726
Tom, can you read me "The Grinch" tonight?

53:50.560 --> 53:55.232
Oh, you know what? I gotta keep working.
But your mom can do it.

53:56.149 --> 53:58.318
She's not as good at the Grinch voice.

53:58.401 --> 54:02.239
-Huh?
-Well, thank you, but duty calls.

54:03.073 --> 54:03.990
Fine.

54:04.866 --> 54:06.076
Are you coming, Mom?

54:07.244 --> 54:10.038
I'm not your mom. I'm the Grinch.

54:10.121 --> 54:11.331
See?

54:11.957 --> 54:12.832
I do.

54:12.916 --> 54:15.252
-Oh, I am the Grinch!

54:15.335 --> 54:17.379
I am the Grinch! I am the Grinch!

54:17.462 --> 54:19.256
That's not a Grinch thing.

55:05.218 --> 55:06.386
-<i>Christmas.</i>

55:06.469 --> 55:09.723
<i>If you're not on the bus, you're under it.</i>

55:59.689 --> 56:00.648
Oh my God.

56:16.998 --> 56:19.793
I saw this and I thought of you.

56:29.469 --> 56:30.345
It's…

56:31.471 --> 56:32.305
great.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.515
Um…

56:35.183 --> 56:36.851
I'm gonna look so…

56:38.645 --> 56:39.604
festive.

56:39.687 --> 56:40.605
Yeah.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.777
Ho! Ho! Ho!

56:47.404 --> 56:48.405
Oh.

56:55.787 --> 56:56.621
Ugh…

57:16.224 --> 57:17.684
So how was work?

57:17.767 --> 57:19.018
It was good. Busy.

57:19.602 --> 57:22.313
-Is Ella still here?
-No, she left with Robert already.

57:22.397 --> 57:25.775
I figured. I wanted to catch her,
because I put all my Christmas songs

57:25.859 --> 57:27.193
on this flash drive for her.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.237
-Yeah, well, you can give it to her later.
-Yeah.

57:29.779 --> 57:31.948
Are we going to pound those
before you go get ready?

57:32.866 --> 57:33.783
For what?

57:33.867 --> 57:35.160
For the sleigh ride.

57:36.077 --> 57:37.412
-Oh, that's tonight?
-Yeah.

57:38.246 --> 57:40.957
I really thought you said it was Saturday.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.710
No, tomorrow is the Christmas carol
sing-along.

57:43.793 --> 57:45.128
The sleigh ride's tonight.

57:46.045 --> 57:51.718
Oh, well, what if we just took a night off
from all things Christmas?

57:52.427 --> 57:53.595
It's totally sold out.

57:53.678 --> 57:56.181
So this is the only night we can go.

57:56.264 --> 57:58.475
Yeah, but what if we didn't go?

57:58.558 --> 57:59.767
I go every year.

58:00.768 --> 58:04.230
Tom. Look at yourself. You're exhausted.

58:04.731 --> 58:07.775
You can't keep burning
the Christmas candle at both ends.

58:08.359 --> 58:09.402
I will be fine.

58:09.486 --> 58:11.571
Okay. Well, I don't feel like going

58:11.654 --> 58:14.365
and getting bundled up
to just freeze on a sleigh ride.

58:14.949 --> 58:17.744
They have hot drinks,
and it's a pretty mild night.

58:17.827 --> 58:19.412
-Okay, Tom…
-Once you get there,

58:19.496 --> 58:21.164
you'll see it's really fun.

58:21.247 --> 58:24.000
Okay, Tom, I said I don't want to go.

58:25.293 --> 58:29.506
Yeah, but I planned on going.
So I feel like I really need to go.

58:31.883 --> 58:32.842
Then go.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.139
You're not coming?

58:38.890 --> 58:39.724
I'm not.

58:41.893 --> 58:44.354
Hey. You can't give up on Christmas now.

58:44.437 --> 58:46.314
Okay, I'm not giving up, Tom.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.358
I just need a break.

58:48.942 --> 58:50.235
Christmas is a break.

58:50.318 --> 58:53.279
This is when we all get
to be the better versions of ourselves.

58:53.905 --> 58:55.156
Is that what this is?

58:55.949 --> 58:57.659
The better version of Tom?

58:58.201 --> 59:00.578
-Yes.
-All right, I thought so too.

59:00.662 --> 59:04.040
Because I thought that you were,
you know, interrupting your work schedule

59:04.123 --> 59:07.669
to make time to do Christmassy things
with me and Ella.

59:08.419 --> 59:11.214
Well, now I realize that you
weren't making time for us.

59:11.923 --> 59:13.633
You're making time for Santa.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.844
Because it's a celebration.

59:16.928 --> 59:19.681
No, Tom. It's an obsession.

59:19.764 --> 59:24.018
It isn't all just joy and fun
and rainbows, okay?

59:24.602 --> 59:29.232
To some of us,
it is empty rituals and broken promises,

59:29.315 --> 59:30.608
and sometimes, Tom,

59:31.484 --> 59:33.236
it really doesn't feel good.

59:42.203 --> 59:47.333
Okay, when I was seven years old
I found a Barbie in my parents' closet.

59:48.042 --> 59:50.753
It was supposed to be to me from Santa.

59:52.463 --> 59:55.508
And when I told them about it,
they didn't give it to me.

59:56.092 --> 1:00:00.680
They returned it and they blamed me
for ruining my own Christmas.

1:00:01.889 --> 1:00:05.393
And Santa didn't show up again after that.

1:00:06.311 --> 1:00:09.063
-I'm sorry.
-They put their precious rituals

1:00:09.147 --> 1:00:11.190
ahead of that little girl's feelings.

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:15.903
And now it's happening again.

1:00:17.864 --> 1:00:18.698
Oh.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:20.992
Okay.

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:32.295
What can I do to make this okay?

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:33.713
You can't, Tom.

1:00:33.796 --> 1:00:39.135
You can't just wave some magic
Christmas wand and make it all better.

1:00:40.553 --> 1:00:43.306
We're just two very different people.

1:00:48.186 --> 1:00:50.313
I don't think we should
keep seeing each other.

1:00:50.396 --> 1:00:51.689
No, Lis.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:54.984
That's not what I want.

1:00:56.319 --> 1:00:58.154
I can't give you what you want, Tom.

1:01:00.865 --> 1:01:02.325
So this is what I want.

1:01:10.958 --> 1:01:13.294
Well, okay. Um…

1:01:18.091 --> 1:01:21.386
You know what, this--
You can give that to Ella.

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:41.781
I never should have
told Lisa about Santa.

1:01:42.949 --> 1:01:43.991
That's not true, buddy.

1:01:44.951 --> 1:01:47.829
It's part of who you are.
That would've killed you.

1:01:47.912 --> 1:01:50.790
Well, not being with her
is killing me more.

1:01:53.626 --> 1:01:55.169
What exactly did she say?

1:01:58.381 --> 1:01:59.382
I ruined our…

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:04.262
That I ruined everything because of Santa.

1:02:06.931 --> 1:02:08.391
Are those the word she used?

1:02:08.933 --> 1:02:11.477
No, I mean not exactly. But…

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:14.021
I got the message.

1:02:16.482 --> 1:02:17.525
Maybe it's not about you.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:22.071
Maybe she has
her own issues with Christmas.

1:02:24.824 --> 1:02:26.576
Well, it's too late now.

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:31.289
Hi, friends.
Welcome to our Christmas sing-along.

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:37.503
We're going to start with an old favorite,
"Jolly Old St. Nicholas."

1:02:37.587 --> 1:02:39.839
And I want to hear everyone singing.

1:02:39.922 --> 1:02:42.633
Lisa would've been
a much better fit for this.

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:44.218
Stop it.

1:03:14.081 --> 1:03:16.083
-Hey.

1:03:16.959 --> 1:03:17.877
You all right?

1:03:20.171 --> 1:03:21.088
No.

1:03:23.174 --> 1:03:24.300
Want to get out of here?

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:27.303
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Come on.

1:03:35.019 --> 1:03:37.730
<i>Mrs. Claus and I have decided</i>

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:42.568
<i>that this is going to be</i>
<i>the best Christmas ever.</i>

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:45.321
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Mer--</i>

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:58.084
<i>"How Christmas turned</i>
<i>my relationship into a lump of coal."</i>

1:04:28.322 --> 1:04:30.116
-I came as fast as I could.

1:04:30.199 --> 1:04:31.409
What is the emergency?

1:04:37.081 --> 1:04:38.332
Hi, Sharon.

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:42.837
Robert had to leave the country
on assignment.

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.589
And the sled race is Sunday.

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:50.094
Oh boy. I have not built
a lot of cardboard sleds in my life.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.140
I told my mom to call Tom,
but she called you.

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:56.601
Tom is busy this week.

1:04:56.684 --> 1:04:59.478
How do you know? You didn't even ask him.

1:04:59.562 --> 1:05:00.521
I just know.

1:05:01.898 --> 1:05:03.524
Okay, well,

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:08.696
what if you just get into a box
and then just slide down the hill? Hmm?

1:05:10.406 --> 1:05:12.116
-Come in.

1:05:12.199 --> 1:05:13.743
-Tom!
-Yahoo!

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:16.871
Ella! Hi! Oh, yeah.

1:05:17.413 --> 1:05:19.832
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:23.377
-You got a project going?
-A big one.

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:29.342
Okay, let me look into it here.
Let me see what we got, Sharon.

1:05:29.425 --> 1:05:30.301
Mm-hmm.

1:05:35.848 --> 1:05:37.600
Oh my gosh!

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:39.977
This is so cool.

1:05:44.231 --> 1:05:46.108
I love this.

1:05:46.776 --> 1:05:48.152
Your place is awesome!

1:05:52.448 --> 1:05:53.449
What's under that?

1:05:55.868 --> 1:05:57.620
-Mmm.
-Uh, whoops.

1:05:58.245 --> 1:06:02.416
How did this sheet get over Santa Claus?

1:06:03.918 --> 1:06:07.004
-You like it?
-Wow. Does he do anything?

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:08.172
Great question.

1:06:09.966 --> 1:06:13.594
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!</i>

1:06:13.678 --> 1:06:17.098
It's alive. Mm-hmm.

1:06:17.181 --> 1:06:20.434
-Can we play with the train?
-Don't you have a project to do?

1:06:20.518 --> 1:06:22.770
Yeah, and it's not good.

1:06:30.903 --> 1:06:31.821
When is this race?

1:06:32.697 --> 1:06:33.698
Sunday morning.

1:06:35.533 --> 1:06:37.159
We're going to need a lot more duct tape.

1:06:38.369 --> 1:06:39.870
What's this supposed to even look like?

1:06:52.550 --> 1:06:57.555
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:05.646
Good night, Jen.

1:07:22.872 --> 1:07:25.041
Grant, do you have a minute?

1:07:26.459 --> 1:07:27.626
You want to talk to me?

1:07:27.710 --> 1:07:30.379
Well, this ought to be good.

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:33.174
Is this about
your delinquent Christmas article?

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:35.259
Delinquent. Big word.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:37.094
Well, I am an editor.

1:07:37.178 --> 1:07:38.012
Hmm.

1:07:39.096 --> 1:07:41.182
-I don't think I can write it.
-Not an option.

1:07:41.265 --> 1:07:44.477
Grant. You know, me.
You know I don't like Christmas.

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:46.270
Why would you assign me this?

1:08:00.701 --> 1:08:04.246
Lisa, I didn't want someone
to just write an article

1:08:04.330 --> 1:08:06.373
about tinsel and eggnog.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:11.420
I wanted someone with a very interesting
take on this whole thing.

1:08:11.504 --> 1:08:12.880
And that is you.

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:14.673
Now, you hate Christmas.

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:16.467
I know. I get it.

1:08:17.426 --> 1:08:18.969
But the whole rest of the world doesn't.

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:22.389
So, how do you meet in the middle?

1:08:24.517 --> 1:08:25.684
Is that all you got?

1:08:28.479 --> 1:08:30.689
I chose you for this
because I have faith in you.

1:08:35.903 --> 1:08:36.779
I know you'll find it.

1:08:53.379 --> 1:08:54.922
-Hey.
-Hi!

1:08:55.005 --> 1:08:55.840
Come on in.

1:08:55.923 --> 1:08:58.467
Thank you for letting me come over.

1:08:58.551 --> 1:08:59.385
Absolutely.

1:09:02.304 --> 1:09:04.932
Whoa, that is delicious!

1:09:06.183 --> 1:09:07.518
Brings back memories.

1:09:08.018 --> 1:09:09.520
But I'll never be as good as my mom's.

1:09:09.603 --> 1:09:11.313
Oh. I bet.

1:09:11.897 --> 1:09:12.731
But I love it.

1:09:15.901 --> 1:09:16.777
So…

1:09:18.362 --> 1:09:19.196
Tom.

1:09:20.489 --> 1:09:23.159
So… yeah.

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:24.785
Hmm.

1:09:26.078 --> 1:09:27.496
I need some perspective.

1:09:28.289 --> 1:09:30.416
How are you so okay with this?

1:09:31.876 --> 1:09:35.588
You have to know, Tom was really worried
about telling you about Santa.

1:09:36.422 --> 1:09:39.550
I mean, I knew Tom for three years
before he told me about him.

1:09:40.426 --> 1:09:43.220
And I thought I kind of knew
everything there was about him,

1:09:43.304 --> 1:09:45.764
and then he dropped this crazy bomb on me.

1:09:45.848 --> 1:09:47.683
But it is crazy, though.

1:09:47.766 --> 1:09:49.476
I thought so too at first.

1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:53.439
But I don't want to judge him
on just this one thing.

1:09:54.106 --> 1:09:55.441
I like being friends with him and…

1:09:58.194 --> 1:10:00.654
I'm not saying it was easy
to have a friend believe in something

1:10:00.738 --> 1:10:04.158
-that no one else over the age of 10 does.
-Right?

1:10:04.241 --> 1:10:08.704
Then I thought about my life
as a Muslim in Denver, Colorado.

1:10:10.664 --> 1:10:13.584
Most days, I'm surrounded by people
who don't believe the same things I do.

1:10:15.753 --> 1:10:17.922
I see the look on some
of the people's faces

1:10:18.005 --> 1:10:19.465
when they find out that I'm a Muslim.

1:10:20.049 --> 1:10:24.637
As if my beliefs somehow
put me in the category of dangerous,

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.222
or evil, or weird,

1:10:26.305 --> 1:10:28.390
or whatever
they associate that part of me with.

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:31.352
Once they put me in that box,

1:10:32.561 --> 1:10:33.479
that's all I'm to them.

1:10:36.148 --> 1:10:37.024
I'm sorry.

1:10:39.068 --> 1:10:39.944
Thank you.

1:10:42.905 --> 1:10:46.075
But Tom, he never did that to me.

1:10:47.076 --> 1:10:49.495
He didn't care that my beliefs
were different from his, so…

1:10:50.579 --> 1:10:51.747
How could I do that to him?

1:10:59.672 --> 1:11:04.176
I hear what you're saying, Assan,
but Santa isn't religion.

1:11:05.552 --> 1:11:09.014
The only difference
between religion and Santa

1:11:09.098 --> 1:11:11.934
is that as we get older,
religious grown-ups

1:11:12.017 --> 1:11:13.811
tell us that our faith
was right all along.

1:11:14.728 --> 1:11:16.480
But they don't have proof either.

1:11:16.563 --> 1:11:18.941
They just tell us that the stories
we believe are true.

1:11:19.817 --> 1:11:23.946
But with Santa, the grown-ups are there
to tell you that the stories are not true.

1:11:24.822 --> 1:11:28.200
And Tom just chose
not to believe the grown-ups.

1:11:31.287 --> 1:11:32.663
You're a good friend.

1:11:33.998 --> 1:11:34.832
So is he.

1:11:44.967 --> 1:11:46.218
Hey, buddy, what's up?

1:11:46.302 --> 1:11:48.178
What time is <i>The Nutcracker</i> tonight?

1:11:48.262 --> 1:11:50.889
I got to load up on caffeine
about 30 minutes before.

1:11:50.973 --> 1:11:52.266
Oh, we are not going.

1:11:53.267 --> 1:11:54.101
What?

1:11:54.893 --> 1:11:57.479
Wait a minute, who is this?
Please put Tom on the phone.

1:11:57.563 --> 1:12:00.399
I can't.
I've got to work on Ella's sled race.

1:12:00.482 --> 1:12:03.569
<i>She stayed way past her bedtime</i>
<i>and we still didn't finish it.</i>

1:12:03.652 --> 1:12:05.988
The greatest Mouse King
to ever grace the stage

1:12:06.071 --> 1:12:09.867
at Woodbury Elementary
is going to skip attending <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

1:12:09.950 --> 1:12:11.702
You know my mom wrote that review.

1:12:12.745 --> 1:12:14.038
What about your schedule?

1:12:14.121 --> 1:12:15.998
<i>Assan, don't you know</i>

1:12:16.081 --> 1:12:18.292
that sometimes you have
to adjust your schedule

1:12:18.375 --> 1:12:20.044
to consider other people's needs?

1:12:21.086 --> 1:12:23.672
Hmm. That sounds like
some real wisdom, buddy.

1:12:23.756 --> 1:12:25.799
<i>One might even say genius.</i>

1:12:26.383 --> 1:12:27.593
How's it coming?

1:12:27.676 --> 1:12:30.095
Still in the assembly phase right now.

1:12:30.179 --> 1:12:31.722
Haven't had a chance to test anything.

1:12:32.973 --> 1:12:34.516
The race is tomorrow, isn't it?

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:35.851
Not helping.

1:12:35.934 --> 1:12:37.519
duct tape.

1:12:37.603 --> 1:12:38.520
I'm hanging up now.

1:12:40.397 --> 1:12:45.194
"Santy Claus, why are you
taking my Christmas tree? Why?"

1:12:54.203 --> 1:12:55.037
<i>Christmas.</i>

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:58.665
<i>Even the Grinch figured it out eventually.</i>

1:13:11.053 --> 1:13:11.887
Tom!

1:13:11.970 --> 1:13:13.639
Hey, Ella!

1:13:15.391 --> 1:13:16.433
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:13:16.975 --> 1:13:19.311
The winning sled is ready to go.

1:13:20.437 --> 1:13:22.689
-Did you add more duct tape?
-I put on every piece we had.

1:13:22.773 --> 1:13:23.857
Here we go!

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:25.818
Did you borrow this from Santa Claus?

1:13:25.901 --> 1:13:29.446
Ha-ha! No, but I did
get a little inspiration from him.

1:13:30.155 --> 1:13:31.115
It looks great,

1:13:31.657 --> 1:13:33.784
but we've never ridden in it before.

1:13:34.284 --> 1:13:35.661
What if it falls apart?

1:13:36.328 --> 1:13:39.248
What if?
You better give it a final inspection.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:44.044
Okay, so I'm gonna head down
to the finish line, to get some pictures.

1:13:44.128 --> 1:13:45.129
Good luck, y'all.

1:13:45.212 --> 1:13:46.130
Stay warm.

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.010
Thank you for making time for this, Tom.

1:13:52.094 --> 1:13:53.679
Ella is super excited.

1:13:53.762 --> 1:13:54.930
She really loves it.

1:13:55.013 --> 1:13:58.475
Well, it's the childlike wonder
that makes the magic.

1:13:59.226 --> 1:14:00.144
Hmm.

1:14:01.603 --> 1:14:06.275
Hey, I'm sorry
for putting Christmas before us.

1:14:07.317 --> 1:14:08.986
I got a little crazy.

1:14:11.572 --> 1:14:13.449
I wouldn't use the word "crazy."

1:14:14.491 --> 1:14:15.367
But thank you.

1:14:16.201 --> 1:14:18.495
-Inspection's all done, chief.
-And?

1:14:19.037 --> 1:14:20.914
She passed with flying colors.

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:23.834
Whoo-hoo! All right, get in there.
Let's see how she feels.

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:27.379
What do you think?

1:14:28.755 --> 1:14:30.799
-She feels perfect.
-Yeah.

1:14:30.883 --> 1:14:32.301
All right, let's do it.

1:14:32.384 --> 1:14:35.429
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

1:14:37.347 --> 1:14:40.058
Oh, Freckles.

1:14:41.018 --> 1:14:42.519
Now we got to win.

1:14:43.270 --> 1:14:45.898
Okay, riders. Load in.

1:14:45.981 --> 1:14:48.609
Family sled race starts in one minute.

1:14:49.151 --> 1:14:51.570
-Are you gonna ride with us, Mom?
-You should.

1:14:51.653 --> 1:14:54.323
I was just going to watch from up here.

1:14:54.406 --> 1:14:56.867
-Come on.
-Yes, there's plenty of room.

1:14:56.950 --> 1:14:58.118
Please, Mom.

1:14:58.202 --> 1:15:00.120
Come on. I can help you.

1:15:00.204 --> 1:15:02.206
I think you're gonna like it… ish.

1:15:05.167 --> 1:15:08.086
All right, everyone squeeze up
to the front there.

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:10.506
I'm kind of eating my kneecaps here.

1:15:10.589 --> 1:15:14.635
That's how she's designed.
Everything good up there, pilot?

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:16.220
Aye, aye, chief.

1:15:17.721 --> 1:15:19.014
So how do we get started?

1:15:19.097 --> 1:15:20.182
Oh, um…

1:15:20.265 --> 1:15:21.308
Am I in time?

1:15:21.391 --> 1:15:24.228
You are, just barely.
She just asked about you.

1:15:25.437 --> 1:15:28.857
All right, when she says "go," you push us
and then we'll do the hard part.

1:15:28.941 --> 1:15:31.568
Uh, pushing is the hard part.

1:15:32.152 --> 1:15:34.321
Riders, take your mark.

1:15:34.404 --> 1:15:35.989
All right, everyone heads down.

1:15:36.073 --> 1:15:36.990
Roger that.

1:15:37.074 --> 1:15:39.034
Tom, I really don't know about this.

1:15:39.117 --> 1:15:41.745
It's going to be okay.
It's a leap of faith.

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:44.790
No, it's a leap off of a literal mountain.

1:15:45.874 --> 1:15:47.501
See you on the other side.

1:15:48.252 --> 1:15:49.336
Riders ready?

1:15:52.422 --> 1:15:53.882
And go!

1:15:55.175 --> 1:15:56.677
Here we go!

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:58.595
Whoa!

1:16:01.974 --> 1:16:04.810
-Ah, this is so scary!

1:16:14.027 --> 1:16:15.445
One sled left to catch!

1:16:18.156 --> 1:16:19.449
We got 'em!

1:16:26.915 --> 1:16:30.335
We can catch them if we take the jump.
Lean right.

1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:35.257
-Brace yourself!
-Ah!

1:16:37.175 --> 1:16:39.011
It'll go faster in the air.

1:16:42.389 --> 1:16:43.432
-Oh my God!

1:16:47.477 --> 1:16:48.770
No!

1:16:53.775 --> 1:16:55.277
Ah!

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:56.236
Come on!

1:17:03.827 --> 1:17:04.828
Yes!

1:17:06.246 --> 1:17:07.372
-Oh!
-Yay!

1:17:07.456 --> 1:17:09.249
-We did it! Yes we…
-We won!

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:11.126
Ah! They won!

1:17:11.209 --> 1:17:13.587
-We won!
-Yeah! We won!

1:17:13.670 --> 1:17:14.963
Yeah!

1:17:16.798 --> 1:17:18.842
Okay! Cheese!

1:17:19.968 --> 1:17:20.844
I pushed them.

1:17:26.892 --> 1:17:29.269
How is the cocoa here at the lodge?

1:17:29.353 --> 1:17:32.105
It's okay,
but not as good as yours.

1:17:32.189 --> 1:17:34.983
Well, I'm gonna make you the cocoa
of champions when we get home

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:39.363
Oh, I'll be talking
about this team forever.

1:17:40.030 --> 1:17:40.989
We're legend.

1:17:41.073 --> 1:17:42.908
-Oh, yes, we are.
-Yes.

1:17:42.991 --> 1:17:45.702
Well, couldn't have done it
without a little push from Assan.

1:17:46.703 --> 1:17:48.038
Thank you, Assan.

1:17:48.121 --> 1:17:51.875
Ahem, um, I would like
to say something to everybody.

1:17:51.958 --> 1:17:53.710
You're going to stand now?

1:17:53.794 --> 1:17:55.545
This is pretty important. Yeah.

1:17:55.629 --> 1:17:56.922
-Here it comes.
-Okay.

1:17:57.589 --> 1:18:01.635
Um, you all know that I love Christmas.

1:18:01.718 --> 1:18:02.594
Understatement.

1:18:02.678 --> 1:18:08.684
But this year I learned
that Christmas can come with challenges

1:18:08.767 --> 1:18:10.060
as well as gifts,

1:18:10.143 --> 1:18:13.605
and that it's the time of year to reflect.

1:18:13.689 --> 1:18:16.650
But reflection can sometimes be painful.

1:18:16.733 --> 1:18:21.738
But I know that I can embrace
whatever the season may bring.

1:18:22.948 --> 1:18:26.034
And that it's spending time
with the people you love

1:18:26.118 --> 1:18:27.911
that makes Christmas magical.

1:18:27.994 --> 1:18:31.540
Not just decorations or holiday events.

1:18:31.623 --> 1:18:32.833
Amen, brother.

1:18:32.916 --> 1:18:33.750
Right.

1:18:36.586 --> 1:18:38.588
Well, I want to say something too.

1:18:38.672 --> 1:18:40.048
Oh, here it comes.

1:18:40.132 --> 1:18:41.174
Yeah.

1:18:42.259 --> 1:18:46.388
Um, well, you all know
I was a little reluctant about Christmas.

1:18:46.471 --> 1:18:47.305
A little?

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:50.726
But, Tom, you have taught me

1:18:50.809 --> 1:18:55.313
that it's not just
about strict traditions.

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:56.898
It can be fun again.

1:18:57.482 --> 1:19:02.404
And there isn't always a Barbie
hiding in the closet to ruin everything.

1:19:04.364 --> 1:19:06.825
-A what now?
-Don't stop her. She's on a roll.

1:19:06.908 --> 1:19:08.034
Oh, okay.

1:19:08.577 --> 1:19:09.453
Tom.

1:19:10.078 --> 1:19:11.788
You did this thing for Ella.

1:19:13.039 --> 1:19:14.916
Not because it was Christmas,

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.878
but because you love her and me.

1:19:19.087 --> 1:19:22.799
And when we needed you most,
you were there all in.

1:19:23.425 --> 1:19:26.219
And that's the kind of magic
that I want to believe in.

1:19:27.345 --> 1:19:28.597
Aw.

1:19:29.181 --> 1:19:30.348
Amen, sister.

1:19:31.641 --> 1:19:34.394
And that thing
that I said the other night,

1:19:34.978 --> 1:19:36.104
could I take that back?

1:19:36.188 --> 1:19:37.731
Please. Yes. Please.

1:19:37.814 --> 1:19:40.066
-I agree, yes, thank you.
-Mmm.

1:19:40.984 --> 1:19:41.818
Called it.

1:19:41.902 --> 1:19:43.904
Yeah, it didn't take a genius.

1:19:44.654 --> 1:19:47.407
-But I have one more thing,
-Oh, but I had one more thing.

1:19:47.491 --> 1:19:50.076
-Well, is your thing my thing?
-I don't know what your thing is.

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:52.370
-Maybe you just do your thing.
-You should do your thing.

1:19:52.454 --> 1:19:54.164
Someone do their thing.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.459
You do it. You do it, please.

1:19:57.542 --> 1:19:58.502
Okay.

1:19:59.878 --> 1:20:04.883
Tom, I don't ever want you
to lose your belief in Santa,

1:20:05.425 --> 1:20:06.635
your love of Christmas.

1:20:07.427 --> 1:20:09.221
Because you've taught me
how important it is

1:20:09.304 --> 1:20:12.015
to believe in something
bigger than ourselves.

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:14.392
And something we can't prove.

1:20:15.018 --> 1:20:16.520
And that every grown-up

1:20:16.603 --> 1:20:19.898
should be able to tap into
that childlike wonder

1:20:19.981 --> 1:20:21.983
that just makes life sweeter.

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:23.735
Oh.

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:26.196
Wait, they're not done yet.

1:20:26.738 --> 1:20:29.741
Stay right there. Just gonna do my thing.

1:20:30.325 --> 1:20:32.160
-It's a different thing.
-I knew it.

1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:35.497
I made this list.

1:20:36.331 --> 1:20:40.168
This is my wish list for Santa this year.

1:20:48.260 --> 1:20:49.094
That's it.

1:20:50.178 --> 1:20:51.847
This is everything I want.

1:20:53.390 --> 1:20:54.224
It's us.

1:20:57.686 --> 1:21:02.607
Ella, you are the coolest kid
I have ever met,

1:21:03.191 --> 1:21:07.028
and I promise to always be your friend.

1:21:12.075 --> 1:21:12.951
And Lisa.

1:21:15.078 --> 1:21:20.208
I love you more than
I could even put into words.

1:21:21.209 --> 1:21:22.043
So…

1:21:23.587 --> 1:21:27.048
Instead, I am going
to take a leap of faith

1:21:27.841 --> 1:21:29.634
that our love

1:21:30.218 --> 1:21:36.224
and our future together
will be even bigger than Santa Claus.

1:21:47.527 --> 1:21:49.195
Shut the front door.

1:21:51.197 --> 1:21:52.115
Oh.

1:21:57.704 --> 1:21:59.247
Lisa Ann Russell…

1:22:02.042 --> 1:22:03.293
will you marry me?

1:22:08.798 --> 1:22:11.885
I never expected my proposal
to include Santa Claus.

1:22:13.094 --> 1:22:16.348
-Yes! Yes.
-Yes? Oh good.

1:22:17.557 --> 1:22:18.975
Yes! Whoo!

1:22:19.059 --> 1:22:19.893
Yes!

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:24.564
He is real.

1:22:24.648 --> 1:22:25.482
What?

1:22:25.565 --> 1:22:27.025
Santa is real.

1:22:28.568 --> 1:22:30.487
That's what I asked him for.

1:22:30.987 --> 1:22:32.781
That you and Tom would get married.

1:22:32.864 --> 1:22:34.199
And now you're gonna.

1:22:43.625 --> 1:22:45.335
You can't argue with logic like that.

1:22:50.590 --> 1:22:52.926
Come here. Come here.

1:22:53.009 --> 1:22:55.095
Give me some of that. Aw.

1:22:55.178 --> 1:22:56.596
Oh!

1:22:58.139 --> 1:22:58.974
Boom!

1:22:59.057 --> 1:23:01.267
I did it! I am a man!

1:23:02.477 --> 1:23:05.063
-Ooh! Oh my God, I am sweating.
-You feeling good? Yeah.

1:23:05.146 --> 1:23:06.564
-Every part of me.
-Yeah.

1:23:09.150 --> 1:23:10.068
<i>Christmas.</i>

1:23:10.735 --> 1:23:11.861
<i>Love it or dread it,</i>

1:23:11.945 --> 1:23:15.657
<i>it's the one time of year</i>
<i>when everyone's on the same page.</i>

1:23:16.533 --> 1:23:20.328
<i>Want to turn your house</i>
<i>into a temporary Mardi Gras celebration?</i>

1:23:21.121 --> 1:23:24.374
<i>No need to worry</i>
<i>about your neighbors getting mad.</i>

1:23:24.457 --> 1:23:27.419
<i>They'll turn out in droves</i>
<i>to admire it instead.</i>

1:23:31.172 --> 1:23:33.133
<i>Haven't seen your relatives in a while?</i>

1:23:33.216 --> 1:23:34.050
Ah!

1:23:34.843 --> 1:23:37.887
<i>Take those travel delays</i>
<i>in stride, friends,</i>

1:23:37.971 --> 1:23:41.516
<i>because you're not the only ones</i>
<i>making a journey to reconnect.</i>

1:23:43.893 --> 1:23:48.273
<i>For a short time, the pressures</i>
<i>and the deadlines of our fast-paced world</i>

1:23:48.356 --> 1:23:52.318
<i>give way to traditions both old and new.</i>

1:24:06.041 --> 1:24:07.751
<i>It's Santa's Christmas.</i>

1:24:08.376 --> 1:24:11.129
<i>He transcends country and religion.</i>

1:24:11.629 --> 1:24:14.549
<i>He is unrivaled.</i>
<i>You either believe in him…</i>

1:24:16.009 --> 1:24:16.968
<i>or you don't.</i>

1:24:19.846 --> 1:24:24.059
<i>And we should never doubt the power</i>
<i>of taking our little leaps of faith.</i>

1:24:24.893 --> 1:24:30.940
<i>Faith may be the last great universal</i>
<i>concept holding the whole world together.</i>

1:24:37.322 --> 1:24:41.076
"And besides,
a little magic never hurt anybody."

1:24:42.118 --> 1:24:44.329
"Merry Christmas everyone."

1:24:44.412 --> 1:24:45.830
Aw.

1:24:45.914 --> 1:24:48.416
-Do you like it?
-I love it.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.001
Mwah.

1:24:50.835 --> 1:24:52.003
Well, everything's wrapped.

1:24:52.087 --> 1:24:53.546
-Yeah.
-And we're ready for tomorrow.

1:24:53.630 --> 1:24:55.006
It looks amazing.

1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:58.426
Now we just have to go to bed
and see what Santa brings.

1:24:58.510 --> 1:24:59.886
-Tom.
-Lisa.

1:25:01.387 --> 1:25:04.390
You can believe that,
and I love you anyway.

1:25:05.517 --> 1:25:08.603
And you cannot believe that,
and I love you anyway.

1:25:09.270 --> 1:25:10.355
Hmm.

1:25:13.233 --> 1:25:15.860
A whole crate of this waiting for you

1:25:16.653 --> 1:25:18.321
-in my bedroom.
-Oh.

1:25:18.404 --> 1:25:19.989
I love cilantro.

1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:23.868
Wait for me!

1:25:42.095 --> 1:25:44.222
Oh my gosh!

1:25:44.305 --> 1:25:45.431
Yay!

1:25:48.393 --> 1:25:49.519
Tom?

1:25:56.609 --> 1:25:58.111
<i>Do you believe?</i>
