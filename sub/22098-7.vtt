NARRATOR: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.901
GAETA: Twenty-four
ships jumped away.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.861
That's almost
a third of the fleet.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.948
TIGH: They're gonna follow
Roslin to Kobol to their death.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.743
WOMAN: Cally shot
Sharon!

00:35.828 --> 00:38.830
ADAMA: There are many copies.
You'll see her again.

00:39.498 --> 00:44.085
One of those things put two
rounds into my father's chest.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.878
ROSLIN: We have found Kobol.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.799
And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the Tomb of Athena

00:49.883 --> 00:52.135
and we will find
the road to Earth.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.011
What I need
to know

00:54.096 --> 00:57.181
is exactly how to find
the Tomb of Athena.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.725
I can show
you the path.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.394
BOOMER: I don't know how long the
path is, or exactly where it leads to,

01:01.478 --> 01:04.689
but I can tell you that you're gonna
have to move very, very quickly.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.904
I want to see all recon material
on Kobol immediately in my quarters.

01:11.989 --> 01:13.114
TIGH: Kobol?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.324
I'm putting the
fleet back together.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.910
I'm putting our family
back together again.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.289
The scriptures say some
of us will die on Kobol.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.375
Like a certain
Capt. Apollo?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.659
She could be anywhere.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.871
If we only use information
contained within the book of Pythia,

02:44.081 --> 02:48.709
which makes sense given the president's
identification with that particular gospel,

02:48.919 --> 02:53.422
then the Tomb of Athena is
most likely located somewhere

02:54.132 --> 02:56.843
in the mountains to the
west of the City of the Gods.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.179
Let's assume she starts at the
most easily recognized landmark,

03:00.264 --> 03:02.223
which is the
opera house.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.643
ADAMA: They'd be setting down
somewhere right here in this meadow,

03:06.103 --> 03:07.770
then heading west.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.653
Are you okay?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.530
Yes. I am.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.326
We got to get out of this ravine.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.538
I don't want us to get
caught in a flash flood.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.210
Raptor One
went down

03:31.295 --> 03:33.880
right about here just
outside the ruins of the city.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.757
Now we never made it past, say, here.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.802
But we visually scouted the
approaches out to the mountains.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.687
Thanks.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.688
Any time.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.442
If this is all
she's got to go on,

03:54.526 --> 03:57.653
I don't know how the hell that woman
thinks she's gonna find this tomb.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.489
Well, maybe she's
seen it in a vision.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.782
(SNICKERS)

04:03.160 --> 04:04.577
I'm serious.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.747
She says she
sees things.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.833
Images, prophecies,
whatever.

04:12.544 --> 04:16.422
The point is that she believes in them
and so do the people that are with her.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.633
Sir, with all due respect,
that terrain is so rugged

04:18.717 --> 04:21.427
I can't imagine navigating
it without a map or a guide.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.559
Okay.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.269
King of the hill.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.355
Queen of the hill,
thank you very much.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.899
We should take shelter
until the storm passes.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.193
Sounds good.
After that?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.946
Then we start
the tough part.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.031
(THUNDER CRACKING)

04:44.284 --> 04:45.534
Let's go!

04:50.540 --> 04:53.626
The last rescue team reported
no sign of a Cylon Baseship

04:53.710 --> 04:55.419
or a Raider anywhere
near Kobol.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.048
We'll set the jump arrival
coordinates in the upper atmosphere

04:59.132 --> 05:00.424
just in case.

05:00.509 --> 05:05.262
Sir, that's risky and it's certainly
not possible with a ship of this size.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.640
I'll be going
down in a Raptor.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.891
What?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.812
I'm not gonna leave
the fleet undefended

05:12.896 --> 05:15.398
and it's too risky
to try and take all of us.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.733
Send a search party,
for frak's sake.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.739
"And Zeus warned the leaders
of the 12 tribes

05:23.991 --> 05:27.493
"that any return to Kobol
would exact a price in blood. "

05:27.577 --> 05:29.578
It certainly
did for us.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.083
No more bloodshed,
enough loss.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.211
I'm only gonna take people
who are absolutely necessary.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.255
Don't try and argue
with me, Saul.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.216
Truth is,

05:43.427 --> 05:46.262
I'm the only one that
can reach out to Roslin.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.390
It's always been
between us anyway.

05:49.474 --> 05:53.102
We may have gone down separately,
but we're gonna come back together.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.812
Hopefully on our feet.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.400
But even in body bags we're
gonna be coming back together.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.862
I'm gonna contact
the Astral Queen.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.947
See if they can pick us up
until the weather clears.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.658
You're not in charge here, Tom.
All com traffic goes through me.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.285
Try to
remember that.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.458
How much longer do
you want to wait, Tom?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.462
Just keep your
eyes on him.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.767
There's a formation
of twin rocks up ahead.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.185
APOLLO: Yeah, I got it.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.937
I think those are
the Gates of Hera.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.355
You think?

07:20.148 --> 07:24.527
I'm putting together a lot of pieces from
a lot of sources beyond your scriptures.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.028
If I'm right,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.239
that's the spot where
your god supposedly stood

07:28.323 --> 07:31.117
and watched Athena throw
herself down onto the rocks below

07:31.201 --> 07:33.994
out of despair over the
exodus of the 13 tribes.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.204
Supposedly?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.081
I thought the Cylons
believed in the gods.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.041
STARBUCK: Yeah, don't get her started.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.919
They believe in one true
God or something like that.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.879
And we don't
worship false idols.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.132
You were quick enough
to come on this mission.

07:46.216 --> 07:50.344
Lead us all to some tomb only actually
mentioned in our false scriptures.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.972

religion than you do.

Athena's Tomb,
whoever,

07:56.601 --> 08:00.187

is probably up there.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.982
That part
is true.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.193
Madam President, we won't make
it up there before nightfall.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.571
Let's go,
see how far we get.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.162
This is a
depressing place.

never made it in here.

Our child will be born
here. In this room.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.645
You're
not listening.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.938
Oh, you noticed?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.691
No, I have
had enough.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.027
Do you seriously expect
me to listen to you

08:48.111 --> 08:50.154
while you sit around stark naked?

08:50.906 --> 08:53.240

mythical baby of ours?

Mythical?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.035
Yes, mythical.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.414
Do you have any notion of
how ridiculous you've become?

The whole turn of our conversation
is completely shot to pieces.

09:03.752 --> 09:08.088
I'm the father of a baby who'll be
born to me from my fantasy woman,

09:08.173 --> 09:09.673
who I see
solely in my head.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.259
My fantasy woman, by the way,
who stopped being my fantasy.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.261
You're not my
fantasy anymore.

09:14.346 --> 09:18.265
No, sadly now you're nothing
more than a common tease.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.768
I never said I would bear the child.

09:20.852 --> 09:25.314
Wonderful! More
doubletalk. More mind games.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.524
All right, then
who is it gonna be?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.986
Who's going to bear
our secret love child?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.821
It's not Starbuck,
is it?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.951
Careful, Gaius, you're in
dangerous territory now.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.495
Then I guess
I'm really scared.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.748
So, what's it going to
be this week? What is it?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.917
Don't tell me,
I'll guess.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.254
The ship's
gonna blow up!

09:48.338 --> 09:49.755
No, damn!

09:49.839 --> 09:53.050
Done that one. So it's
gotta be someone else.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.010
Someone... Me!

09:55.178 --> 09:58.055
But, of course, me!
I'm gonna explode! God!

09:58.139 --> 10:01.600
God is gonna make me spontaneously
combust into a great big ball of flame,

10:01.685 --> 10:04.603
and then the whole crew of
Galactica can celebrate on ambrosia.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.355

Okay. Enough,
I can't do this anymore.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.119
You're right.
Game's over you win.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.831
I win?

10:27.752 --> 10:28.877
What did I win?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.045
You don't get it?

10:31.881 --> 10:35.718
Come on, Gaius, wake up and
smell the psychosis already.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.221
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.557
Okay. Look,

10:42.267 --> 10:45.394
there's no Cylon chip
implanted in your brain.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.563
I'm not real.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.442
You're not really getting
secret messages from the Cylons.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.236
You're just crazy.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.077
Very funny.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.913
Hysterical. Do you
write your own material?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.498
You don't believe me,
do you?

11:06.583 --> 11:07.791
No, I don't.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.209

11:11.296 --> 11:13.339
That's great! I love it. Is it?

11:13.423 --> 11:14.965
Good. I've had enough
of this, all right?

11:15.050 --> 11:16.675
So can we just stop
playing this stupid game?

11:16.760 --> 11:17.968
I'm sorry.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.930
But it's the truth.
There is no chip.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.102
If there is no chip,

11:28.271 --> 11:29.563
then who

11:30.607 --> 11:33.525
or what are
you exactly?

11:34.361 --> 11:35.652
I'm you.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.948
I'm your subconscious
frakking with your mind.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.621
Okay,
check it out.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.376
You helped the Cylons commit
genocide against your own people,

11:50.460 --> 11:53.629
and your fragile little mind
couldn't handle it. So, poof!

11:54.130 --> 11:56.965
I appear and start telling
you how special you are.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.886
How God has chosen you. Yeah, right!

12:06.434 --> 12:09.144
Well, I don't know what
game you're playing anymore.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.316
But I'm not playing this stupid
game, so, now you've had your fun.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.319
Why don't you get yourself checked out?

12:18.154 --> 12:21.615
Go down to sickbay and get a brain
scan. That would settle it, wouldn't it?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.745
Go ahead.
I dare you.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.257
How simple
could it be?

12:38.341 --> 12:42.010
Okay, we're in the
North-northwest continent.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.930
Quadrant C, Sector two, which...

12:45.723 --> 12:48.809
Oh, for frak's sake let me see if
I can make heads or tails of it.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.354
Look, I marked the terrain as
best I could, but we're not...

12:53.398 --> 12:55.649
Topography's for
pansies anyways.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.527
How're you feeling?
Diplomatic?

12:58.862 --> 13:01.738
I still don't think this is
a very good idea, Commander.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.283
The last time she saw me
she wasn't too happy with me.

13:04.367 --> 13:08.454
She trusts you. Values your
counsel. She'll listen to you.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.289
I doubt that
very much.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.167
I'm her assistant. She doesn't put
any more stock than what I say...

13:13.251 --> 13:15.627
She thinks you'll
be president one day.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.298
Excuse me?

13:19.382 --> 13:20.883
That's what she
said to me once.

13:21.718 --> 13:26.180
That you reminded her of President
Adar when he ran for his first office.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.977
I don't really know how
to respond to that, sir.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.606
Don't let it go to your
head. Adar was a moron.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.358
This is an
intra-atmos entry.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.485
You guys
buckled in?

13:39.569 --> 13:40.569
ADAMA: Yeah.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.502
Perimeter's clear!
No Cylon presence!

13:56.586 --> 13:59.546
See? Nothing
to worry about.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.466
Having good
luck already.

14:33.081 --> 14:37.960
Gives me the creeps seeing
him acting like that with her.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.880
He loves her.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.882
And, yeah, he knows she's a machine.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.969
He doesn't care.
He loves her anyway.

14:48.763 --> 14:52.140
Frak. How can one of us get
that roped in by one of them?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.643
We should keep
an eye on him, too.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.397
Helo's a friend of mine, all
right? He's one of the good guys.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.148
Yeah?

15:00.775 --> 15:02.568
Sharon was a friend
of yours, too.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.702
Feel like
I'm back on Caprica.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.372
No, thanks.
I'm happy right here.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.166
Really?

15:19.335 --> 15:23.672
Yeah, actually. Just being with you
and Kara feels like I've come home.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.757
It's like I'm
back in the fleet.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.094
But you were never in the
fleet. That was the other Sharon.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.471
I know.
I know that.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.641
But I remember
all of it.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.937
Like getting my wings. My
first trip aboard the Galactica.

15:41.399 --> 15:46.069
You know, the memory of being in
a uniform is so strong, so potent,

15:46.154 --> 15:49.573
it's like, "I'm Sharon Valerii
and this is my family. "

15:53.703 --> 15:54.911
That's pretty
weird, huh?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.038
It's okay.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.540
I like weird.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.962
Losing that priest
really frakked her up.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.882
She's lost a
lot of people.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.468
Friends,
supporters.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.055
All she has left
is her young prince.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.266
We're here.
He's here.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.685
We know what
we have to do.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.980
Terrain's rougher
than we thought.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.274
Don't know how far
until we reach this tomb.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.901
Why are you backing
out of this now?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.486
I'm not backing out of anything.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.073
Getting blood on your hands is
a lot harder than washing it off.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.742
Then let the
Cylon do it.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.205
What if the Cylon were to get
a weapon and shoot him herself?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.583
There'll be a lot of
confusion, stress, panic.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.462
Then the Cylon could find
herself getting shot real easy.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.883
And how would you propose
such a thing might happen?

16:50.718 --> 16:53.553
This has to happen,
Tom. You know that.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.850
Not until we
find the tomb.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.786
HELO: How much
further?

17:17.870 --> 17:18.995
Farther.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.872
HELO: What?

17:20.957 --> 17:24.334
Farther describes actual distance,
further is more figurative.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.421
What are you
a dictionary now?

17:27.505 --> 17:29.297
I'm sorry
I'm smarter than you.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.761
That's okay. The baby can have your
brains as long as he gets my looks.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.806
Yeah, that'd be
a real blessing for her.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.558
Her?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.227
You know
it's a girl?

17:43.813 --> 17:44.980
Yeah.

17:47.608 --> 17:51.653
STARBUCK: So from what I could tell,
the Cylons have a plan for Caprica.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.989
They're cleaning
up the bodies,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.742
bringing in the heavy machinery
to fix the infrastructure.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.201
I understand.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.787
But they haven't
killed everyone.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.831
There's a
resistance movement.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.626
Once we find the tomb and get the map,
I think our first order of business

18:06.711 --> 18:09.588
has to be planning a rescue
mission back to Caprica.

18:10.965 --> 18:14.092
Lieutenant, I hope you know how
grateful I am for everything you've done

18:14.177 --> 18:16.928
and what you risked, but right
now I can't think about anything

18:17.013 --> 18:18.555
but finding
that tomb.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.182
Thank you.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.779
Comfy?
Can't talk.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.281
Can't move.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.491
Then you

18:37.909 --> 18:40.494
certainly wouldn't want me to do this.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.998
Oh, for... I told you
not to move.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.377
I'm so terribly sorry,
Doctor. It won't happen again.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.840
All right. Now I have to reset
and start from the beginning.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.468
Now he's got to reset
and start all over again.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.054
(SIGHS)

19:02.391 --> 19:03.683
Why are you
doing this to me?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.519
Come on, Gaius, even
back when you weren't nuts

19:05.603 --> 19:07.729
there was always that
little voice in your head.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.482
That little voice helping you
through the rough times, remember?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.487
I'm just the latest version
of that little voice.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.074
I don't believe
that for one moment.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.993
No, God has
a plan for me.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.495
God's plan?

19:23.830 --> 19:24.830
(LAUGHING)

19:24.914 --> 19:28.333
Okay. Yeah,
God has a plan and

19:28.417 --> 19:31.253
there is a God and he
talks to Gaius Baltar.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.129
Okay.
Shut up will you!

19:33.673 --> 19:34.673
(GROANS)

19:37.927 --> 19:40.095
Will you stop going
crazy in there?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.098
I'm not crazy.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.274
Once you find this tomb, you know
he's gonna have you killed, right?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.483
He's not
like that.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.653
He's a soldier, you're the enemy.
Nothing's gonna change that.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.572
Your twin, your copy or whatever...

19:58.656 --> 19:59.823
I know.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.785
The other Sharon shot the old man.
I've heard it about a thousand times.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.787
Do you remember
shooting him?

20:07.582 --> 20:08.874
It wasn't me.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.292
Do you remember?

20:10.376 --> 20:11.459
No.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.421
I see.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.548
What do you think
happened to her?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.966
I don't know.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.428
Probably threw her in
the brig or something.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.310
She was murdered
by one of the crew.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.271
And everyone aboard
Galactica just let it happen.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.984
Think I'm lying?
Ask Lee.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.822
They're not gonna let
your child be born.

20:41.449 --> 20:45.035
You think they're gonna let you raise
a potential enemy right in their midst?

20:46.704 --> 20:50.624
You want to get off this planet alive,
you better start looking out for yourself.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.628
(WINGS FLUTTERING)

21:03.054 --> 21:04.179

Put down your weapon, Captain.

to see you.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.463
Billy.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.258
Billy, you have no idea

22:23.676 --> 22:26.219
what it means to me
to have you here.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.304
It's good to
see you, too.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.632
Oh, my gods.
Commander!

23:11.766 --> 23:13.767

23:41.045 --> 23:42.420
Why?

23:47.134 --> 23:48.384
ROSLIN: Commander, no!

23:48.469 --> 23:49.677
Get off him.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.764
I want you to die.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.273
Commander, please
don't. We need her.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.818
Commander,
you got to let her go.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.111
Die.

satisfied?

24:48.404 --> 24:49.529
Yes. Yes, I am.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.114
Thank you very
much, Doctor.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.407
Just...

24:54.743 --> 24:57.912
We're absolutely positive,
aren't we, that there's no

25:00.416 --> 25:02.792
unidentified objects?

25:03.085 --> 25:06.754
You can obsess over these as
much as you like on your own time.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.215
Freaking
hypochondriac.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.092
One on every
bloody ship.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.347
You interfered with
a military mission

25:16.432 --> 25:18.391
and you broke
your word to me.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.812
It's the second part that
really bothers you, isn't it?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.607
Laura, I forgive you.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.612
Thank you, Bill.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.033
I didn't ask for
your forgiveness.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.037
Well, you have
it anyway.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.126
I can't believe the old
man reacted like that.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.795
You know they killed
the other Sharon?

25:48.797 --> 25:49.881
What?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.759
In cold blood,
not even a trial.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.764
TYROL: Hi.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.312
Hi.

26:07.316 --> 26:08.483
Sharon?

26:15.950 --> 26:17.200
Hello, Chief.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.745
You know who I am?

26:22.539 --> 26:23.665
Yes.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.793
We haven't met but

26:27.670 --> 26:29.003
I remember you.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.315
It's good
to see you.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.869
So where does
this leave us?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.372
Back to where
we started.

27:04.707 --> 27:08.042
Under the yoke of President
Roslin and Commander Adama.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.798
Not if we go back to the
ship with a map to Earth.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.258
And a sad story
of how many people

27:15.342 --> 27:17.468
were killed down on
Kobol by the Cylons.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.886
It's over.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.056
Let it go for now.

27:33.527 --> 27:37.780
Lieutenant Thrace says that there
are survivors on the Colonies.

27:39.783 --> 27:43.328
There are people fighting
against the Cylons every day.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.539
They're fighting for
their homes, their future.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.541
I see.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.419
Doesn't give
you pause?

27:52.546 --> 27:55.256
Maybe your impulse the day
the Cylons attacked was right.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.092
Maybe we should've stayed
and fought for our homes.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.719
Maybe the President
of the Colonies

27:59.803 --> 28:01.637
should've stayed
with her people.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.556
I didn't come
here for this.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.893
I didn't come
here to navel-gaze

28:06.977 --> 28:09.771
or to catalog
our mistakes.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.609
We made a decision to leave
the Colonies after the attack.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.487
We made that decision.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.282
It was the right one then,
it's the right one now.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.037
So every moment of
every day since then

28:26.663 --> 28:27.997
is a gift.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.083
From the gods?

28:30.167 --> 28:31.376
No.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.752
From you.

28:33.754 --> 28:37.006
For convincing me
that I should go.

28:39.468 --> 28:40.968
I would be dead.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.304
My son would be dead.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.392
Whatever else
the costs,

28:47.476 --> 28:49.977
I won't second-guess
that outcome.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.622
I think it's time
to go find this

29:10.499 --> 29:11.916
tomb of yours.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.965
So Cally kills
Sharon

29:19.550 --> 29:22.385
and the old man gives
her 30 days in the brig.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.303
Thirty days for murder.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.514
They don't see it
as murder, Helo.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.765
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.976
That's what
you're not hearing.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.187
To him, to the
president, to all of them,

29:34.314 --> 29:36.190
Cylons aren't
people.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.362
I'm not a person
to them,

29:42.030 --> 29:43.448
I'm a thing.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.284
(SIGHS)

29:46.368 --> 29:50.288
I won't just stand by and let them
kill you like the other Sharon.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.165
Okay?

29:54.710 --> 29:57.128
I believe you,
Helo. I do.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.261
(SIGHS)

30:07.806 --> 30:10.600
But if we're gonna have
any future together,

30:11.560 --> 30:13.060
any at all,

30:15.272 --> 30:18.191
I'm gonna have to take
matters into my own hands.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.113
What're you
talking about?

30:25.407 --> 30:26.824
Do you love me?

30:26.909 --> 30:27.950
Yes.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.077
Do you trust me?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.246
Yes.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.666
Then don't ask me
what I have to do.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.752
Sharon, what the
frak are you...

30:38.962 --> 30:40.254
Trust me.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.465
Trust us.

30:50.891 --> 30:53.142
Have you had a chance to
think about our conversation?

30:53.227 --> 30:54.602
Haven't thought
about anything else.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.770
And?

30:55.854 --> 30:58.064
When we get to the entrance,
they'll be distracted.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.691
I'll take the father
and you take the son.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.527
You should see this!

31:44.278 --> 31:47.321
Lieutenant Thrace, I hope
you have that Arrow handy.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.212
I need you to
know something.

32:03.297 --> 32:04.880
I'm Sharon but I'm
a different Sharon.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.173
I know who I am.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.677
I don't have hidden protocols or
programs lying in wait to be activated.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.512
I make my own choices.
I make my own decisions

32:11.597 --> 32:14.390
and I need you to know
that this is my choice.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.453
This is one of
the old stallions.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.621
It's not
military issue.

32:36.705 --> 32:37.788
Where the hell
did you get this?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.123
It's his.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.084
(GASPS)

32:47.549 --> 32:50.134
(GROANING)

32:50.218 --> 32:51.469
Take it easy.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.055
Just wanted

32:54.806 --> 32:56.849
to see you
get your due.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.976
You never did
listen to me.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.311
(GROANS)

33:26.588 --> 33:29.757
Stupid frakking thing
couldn't come with a handbook.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.928
No, because that would just
be too logical, wouldn't it?

33:34.971 --> 33:38.724
"And the Arrow of Apollo will
open the Tomb of Athena. "

33:38.809 --> 33:42.937
Yeah, well, unless anyone
sees a keyhole, or whatever,

33:43.021 --> 33:44.689
then we're either
in the wrong place

33:44.773 --> 33:46.440
or we're just
perfectly screwed.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.858
ADAMA: Okay, then why
don't we just...

33:47.943 --> 33:49.193
Helo, come here.

33:56.451 --> 34:00.204
APOLLO: On three.
One, two, three!

34:02.457 --> 34:03.541
There it is.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.792
Oh, my gods.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.848
After you.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.190
Helo, you stay out.
Yes, sir.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.984
Chief?
TYROL: Sir.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.028
ADAMA:
Guard everybody.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.447
TYROL: Yes, sir.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.914
STARBUCK: If the Arrow
didn't actually open the tomb,

34:43.999 --> 34:46.292
how do we know this is the right place?

34:46.376 --> 34:48.002
We don't.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.171
But it's a tomb all right.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.340
The scriptures say you need
the Arrow to find the map.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.886
These broken statues,
I recognize them.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.847
The ram, Aerilon.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.682
Gemenon, the twins.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.935
These are the icons of the
12 tribes, the 12 Colonies.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.605
This is really
where it all began.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.733
STARBUCK: We all came
from this place.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.027
This could be Picon,
the fish.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.280
I guess, this little lady
could be Virgon, right?

35:18.033 --> 35:19.742
The goat,
Caprica.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.368
ROSLIN: Sagittaron,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.538
the archer.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.965
He's missing
something.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.517
APOLLO: Where
the hell are we?

36:26.601 --> 36:27.852
ROSLIN: I don't know.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.982
Tomb of Athena,
I think.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.484
I thought we were
already in the tomb.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.945
STARBUCK: (WHISPERING) I
think that was the lobby.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.949
Again the
ancient symbols.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.953
ROSLIN: These patterns

36:46.788 --> 36:49.582
were on the original
flags of the 12 Colonies,

36:49.666 --> 36:53.377
back in the days when the Colonies
were called by their ancient names:

36:54.713 --> 36:55.921
ROSLIN: Aries.

36:59.801 --> 37:00.968
Taurus.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.845
Gemini.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.847
Cancer.

37:05.891 --> 37:06.974
Leo.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.726
ROSLIN: Libra.

37:09.311 --> 37:10.477
Virgo.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.856
ADAMA: The jewels match
the constellations.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.567
APOLLO: This is the map.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.904
This is the
map to Earth.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.614
ADAMA: Maybe.

37:22.824 --> 37:26.285
So is Earth in one
of these constellations?

37:29.664 --> 37:31.415
We're standing on it.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.836
We're standing on Earth.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.465
STARBUCK: The scriptures say

37:39.674 --> 37:42.426
that when the 13th
tribe landed on Earth,

37:42.886 --> 37:46.221
they looked up into the heavens
and they saw their 12 brothers.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.932
ROSLIN: Earth
is the place

37:48.767 --> 37:51.018
where you can
look up in the sky

37:52.103 --> 37:55.731
and see the constellations
of the 12 Colonies.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.695
I don't know what good
it's gonna do us though.

38:02.072 --> 38:04.031
Then what are we
supposed to do?

38:04.324 --> 38:08.452
Search the entire galaxy for
one particular star pattern?

38:11.081 --> 38:14.166
There. There in Scorpio.
I've seen that before.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.962
APOLLO: It's the
Lagoon nebula.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.965
ADAMA: Astro body M8.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.467
That's a long
way from here.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.302
Yeah.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.389
But at least
now we have

38:28.890 --> 38:30.808
a map and a direction.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.614
We have struggled
since the attacks,

38:48.076 --> 38:50.327
trying to rely
on one another.

38:51.413 --> 38:54.540
Our strength, and our
only hope as a people

38:56.084 --> 38:58.043
is to remain
undivided.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.090
We haven't always done
all we could to ensure that.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.845
Many people believe
that the scriptures,

39:08.138 --> 39:09.972
the letters
from the gods,

39:10.515 --> 39:13.100
will lead us
to salvation.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.645
Maybe they will.

39:19.441 --> 39:22.860
"But the gods shall lift
those who lift each other. "

39:23.862 --> 39:26.947
And so, to
lift all of us,

39:28.408 --> 39:30.451
let me present once again

39:30.702 --> 39:34.038
the President of the Colonies,
Laura Roslin.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.625
(CLAPPING CONTINUES)

40:35.183 --> 40:36.308
Thank you.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.122
I'm okay.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.834
I'm okay, really.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.545
Yeah?

41:13.721 --> 41:15.180
It's just...

41:17.433 --> 41:20.060
I don't want our baby
born in this cell.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.402
Their child?

41:28.736 --> 41:30.779
I told you
a child would arrive.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.782
Told you it would be born
right here in this room.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.785
How could you
ever doubt me?

41:39.664 --> 41:41.665
Boomer is
going to bear

41:43.084 --> 41:44.334
our child?

41:44.460 --> 41:46.545
An honor for which she
is hardly deserving,

41:46.629 --> 41:49.089
but one doesn't
question God's will.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.763
Well, you're
not a chip.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.850
That we've
established.

42:00.393 --> 42:01.435
Yes.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.023
BALTAR: Sharon being
pregnant does suggest

42:06.107 --> 42:10.068
that you are rather more than a simple
manifestation of my subconscious.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.447
I'm not...

42:14.574 --> 42:16.450
Crazy?
No.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.579
Then who,

42:22.332 --> 42:23.457
or what,

42:24.417 --> 42:25.584
are you

42:26.085 --> 42:27.336
exactly?

42:28.671 --> 42:31.298
I'm an angel of God
sent here to protect you.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.717
To guide you,
to love you.

42:35.929 --> 42:37.304
To what end?

42:39.015 --> 42:41.225
To the end
of the human race.

43:00.745 --> 43:02.329
