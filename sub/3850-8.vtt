WEBVTT

00:00.007 --> 00:01.231
I don't know what we're supposed to do

00:01.232 --> 00:02.500
when Vivian's not in town either.

00:02.501 --> 00:04.882
We probably should've talked
about it before she left.

00:04.918 --> 00:07.018
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:07.054 --> 00:09.287
Maybe we shouldn't tell Vivian about this.

00:09.323 --> 00:11.022
- Can it be my decision?
- Sure.

00:11.058 --> 00:12.324
I'm... I'm three years sober.

00:12.392 --> 00:14.025
I know what I must look like,

00:14.094 --> 00:15.794
but once I owned up to it, I was free.

00:15.829 --> 00:17.662
What if you knew exactly when and where

00:17.731 --> 00:18.863
Luca was gonna cheat next?

00:18.932 --> 00:20.732
What if I got Luca in bed long enough

00:20.801 --> 00:21.900
for us to catch it on camera?

00:21.935 --> 00:22.969
- Right. Right. Right.
- Right.

00:22.970 --> 00:23.969
Yeah, yeah. Perfect!

00:24.037 --> 00:25.036
The texts aren't sending.

00:25.138 --> 00:26.771
There's bad reception in the lobby.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.107
There. You're all set.
We're gonna nail him.

00:31.878 --> 00:33.578
Come on. Come on.

00:35.148 --> 00:37.582
Aah!

00:37.651 --> 00:38.950
Oh, my god!

00:41.288 --> 00:44.823
Luca?

00:44.858 --> 00:49.227
Luca. Oh!

00:49.329 --> 00:54.099
Luca? Can you hear me? Oh, my god.

01:02.209 --> 01:03.775
Oh, my god. O... oh, my god.

You've reached Calista.

01:14.921 --> 01:16.354
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

01:16.423 --> 01:18.056
Where are you? You need to call me.

01:18.091 --> 01:19.290
Please. Something happened. Please.

01:23.463 --> 01:25.163
Harry, please pick up.
Please, please, please.

01:26.767 --> 01:28.933
Hi. It's Harry. Leave a message,

01:28.969 --> 01:31.703
and I'll call you back...

01:33.073 --> 01:36.408
Calista!

01:46.319 --> 01:49.687
Karen! Karen?

01:49.790 --> 01:50.822
Karen!

02:21.421 --> 02:23.121
Fancy meetin' you here.

02:23.190 --> 02:24.522
You can't sleep either, huh?

02:24.624 --> 02:28.927
I bet you miss Scotty.

02:29.029 --> 02:30.228
I do, actually.

02:30.330 --> 02:33.064
I've grown used to his tiny-man snores.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.634
But I always have a hard time sleeping.

02:36.736 --> 02:38.536
Insomnia's kind of my thing.

02:38.638 --> 02:40.538
- Lucky you.
- Oh, it's not so bad.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.874
Gives me some time to
ponder the meaning of life

02:42.976 --> 02:45.710
and come up with iPhone apps
that haven't been invented yet.

02:45.812 --> 02:48.947
Frankly, I'm closer to
solving the meaning of life.

02:49.049 --> 02:52.183
You still upset about your mom?

02:52.252 --> 02:54.719
A little.

02:54.821 --> 02:56.387
I'm also dreading telling Blair.

02:56.490 --> 02:57.989
He's gonna be so disappointed.

02:58.118 --> 03:00.051
Well, no offense, but I'm not sure

03:00.153 --> 03:03.121
Blair's disappointment is
worth keeping you up at night.

03:03.223 --> 03:05.823
I mean, are you guys
even really that serious?

03:05.926 --> 03:07.926
I don't know.

03:08.028 --> 03:09.494
Hey, how's Harry?

03:09.596 --> 03:12.230
Harry? He... he's great. Why?

03:12.332 --> 03:13.498
How can he be great?

03:13.600 --> 03:15.833
He and Joss just broke
up, and she's devastated.

03:15.902 --> 03:19.470
I thought we were talking
about you and Blair.

03:19.573 --> 03:21.072
Now we're talking about Harry and Joss.

03:21.174 --> 03:22.473
Why is he great?

03:22.576 --> 03:24.175
Uh, he's not. He's just...

03:24.277 --> 03:25.577
You know, he's fine.

03:25.679 --> 03:27.645
No, you didn't say
"fine." You said "great."

03:27.747 --> 03:29.314
Uh... look, April,

03:29.416 --> 03:34.586
uh... men and women tend to...
deal with breakups differently.

03:34.688 --> 03:36.854
I'm... sure you know this.

03:36.957 --> 03:38.089
Differently how?

03:38.191 --> 03:40.725
Oh, in the way we express... sadness.

03:40.794 --> 03:43.728
You know, women tend
to be sadder... longer.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.897
So you're saying Harry's not sad?

03:45.999 --> 03:47.565
I'm not saying that at
all. I'm sure he's sad.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.234
That's probably why he's acting out.

03:49.336 --> 03:52.704
Acting out how?

03:52.806 --> 03:54.739
Is Harry already dating another woman?

03:54.841 --> 03:57.008
Dating? No. Definitely not.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.143
But he had sex with another woman.

04:01.147 --> 04:02.447
Who?

04:02.515 --> 04:05.583
Uh, I really, really can't say.

04:05.685 --> 04:07.085
- Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
- Niko. Niko.

04:07.187 --> 04:08.686
He slept with Niko.

04:08.788 --> 04:09.988
Who the hell is Niko?

04:10.090 --> 04:11.389
What is wrong with men?!

04:11.491 --> 04:14.058
April, you cannot say anything.
This is serious bro code stuff.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.361
I'm not gonna break your stupid-ass code.

04:16.463 --> 04:17.695
You think I wanna hurt Joss?

04:17.731 --> 04:19.564
But damn! I am really disappointed in him.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.298
I thought Harry was better than that.

04:21.401 --> 04:22.867
I know. Me, too.

04:23.034 --> 04:26.836
Y'all are pathetic.
Predictable and pathetic.

04:26.905 --> 04:29.772
Why you mad at me? I didn't do anything.

04:49.728 --> 04:52.061
What the hell?

04:52.163 --> 04:54.230
Why are all the lights on?

04:55.934 --> 04:57.867
Oh, my god.

04:57.969 --> 04:59.168
Joss, what happened?

05:00.705 --> 05:02.238
Did he hurt you?

05:02.307 --> 05:03.806
I need to know what happened.

05:03.908 --> 05:06.142
I don't know. He...

05:06.244 --> 05:07.510
What did Luca do?

05:07.612 --> 05:09.712
He died.

05:09.814 --> 05:11.047
What?

05:11.149 --> 05:12.849
Someone killed him
while I was in the house.

05:12.917 --> 05:15.418
I was upstairs. The
lights went out. He was...

05:15.520 --> 05:18.287
He was lying on the stairs. I...

05:18.390 --> 05:20.723
There was so much blood, Karen.

05:20.825 --> 05:22.458
Okay. Breathe.

05:22.527 --> 05:24.427
I want you to breathe.

05:25.864 --> 05:26.763
Where is Calista?

05:26.865 --> 05:29.532
I don't know. I... I... I...

05:29.634 --> 05:30.967
Her phone keeps going to voicemail.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.835
- I don't know if she's hurt.
- I don't know.

05:32.937 --> 05:34.971
- Did you call the police?
- I was too afraid.

05:35.039 --> 05:36.406
That's okay.

05:36.508 --> 05:38.741
But we're gonna call
them now. Together, okay?

05:38.843 --> 05:40.343
Okay.

05:40.445 --> 05:42.378
Okay? I'm here.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.381
Don't worry. I'm here.

06:18.183 --> 06:20.216
Who's... who's in charge?
Who's in charge here?

06:20.318 --> 06:22.852
Hi. I am Detective Libby Whitehead.

06:22.954 --> 06:24.901
- You the owner of this house?
- Yes, I am.

06:24.902 --> 06:26.352
What happened? Tell me what happened.

06:26.524 --> 06:28.891
That would make you... Calista Raines?

06:28.960 --> 06:30.193
Wife of Luca Raines?

06:30.228 --> 06:31.928
Yes. What happened?

06:31.963 --> 06:34.063
Would you come with me, please,
so that we can speak privately?

06:34.098 --> 06:37.133
Why do we need to speak
privately? What's going on?

06:37.168 --> 06:40.236
Just please, tell me what happened.

06:40.305 --> 06:41.871
I'm sorry, Mrs. Raines,

06:41.906 --> 06:44.240
but your husband was shot tonight.

06:44.309 --> 06:46.676
He was... shot?

06:46.744 --> 06:48.277
Mm-hmm.

06:49.948 --> 06:51.347
Is... is he dead?

06:51.382 --> 06:53.416
He was pronounced dead when
we arrived on the scene.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.386
Who...

06:57.455 --> 06:58.955
How did... who called...

06:59.023 --> 07:00.456
We are still gathering
information, Mrs. Raines.

07:00.525 --> 07:02.625
Whoa. Okay. You need some air?

07:02.694 --> 07:04.527
You know what? Let get you outside. Okay?

07:04.629 --> 07:07.129
Yeah.

07:10.735 --> 07:13.936
Okay, and this is your direct
number or your assistant's?

07:14.005 --> 07:15.505
That's my cell phone.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.106
Okay, look, I'm gonna get Officer Krebbs

07:17.141 --> 07:18.508
to take you where you need to go.

07:18.576 --> 07:20.877
Is there someplace that
you can stay tonight?

07:20.945 --> 07:22.912
A friend or family that you can go to?

07:22.981 --> 07:25.515
The ChÃ¢teau is fine.

07:36.528 --> 07:37.527
Where are you? You need to call me.

07:37.595 --> 07:39.629
Please. Something happened.

07:51.943 --> 07:54.610
So you had a sexual
relationship with Mr. Raines?

07:54.679 --> 07:56.312
No, I was pretending to make out with him

07:56.381 --> 07:57.914
so we could catch him cheating.

07:58.016 --> 07:59.282
"We"?

07:59.317 --> 08:01.050
Yes. Me and Calista.

08:01.119 --> 08:02.418
You're saying Mrs. Raines
was aware of the fact

08:02.487 --> 08:03.819
that you were in bed with
her husband this evening.

08:03.888 --> 08:04.887
That was the plan.

08:04.956 --> 08:07.089
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but it...

08:07.158 --> 08:09.325
I'm just making sure I'm
getting down the facts correctly.

08:09.394 --> 08:11.093
Can we finish this in the morning,

08:11.195 --> 08:13.296
when we all have clearer heads?

08:13.331 --> 08:15.865
Unless you need anything
else from us right now?

08:15.967 --> 08:17.500
This is enough for my initial report.

08:17.602 --> 08:18.968
Thank you, Detective.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.503
In the meantime,

08:20.605 --> 08:23.372
- I'll need the clothes you were wearing tonight.
- My clothes?

08:23.441 --> 08:25.241
Yeah. Sure.

08:32.817 --> 08:33.916
You two are roommates?

08:34.018 --> 08:35.150
This is my place.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.687
Joss has just been staying
with me for a while.

08:37.755 --> 08:39.221
And your last name again?

08:39.323 --> 08:42.525
Kim. Karen Kim.

08:48.566 --> 08:51.033
I, uh, I took a shower.

08:51.135 --> 08:52.602
In your clothes.

08:52.704 --> 08:54.904
I wasn't thinking clearly.

08:55.039 --> 08:57.907
We'll be in touch.

09:05.817 --> 09:08.250
You did great.

09:08.319 --> 09:10.119
I... I don't even know
what I just said. I...

09:10.221 --> 09:12.421
What the hell was that? Why
did they need my clothes?

09:12.523 --> 09:17.360
They're probably going to
test for gunshot residue.

09:17.462 --> 09:19.195
Gunshot residue?

09:23.134 --> 09:25.201
Oh, my god. They think I did it.

09:39.263 --> 09:42.164
So I missed a call from Joss.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.500
Oh, yeah? What'd she say?

09:44.602 --> 09:45.667
She didn't leave a message.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.669
I don't know if I should
call her back or what.

09:47.738 --> 09:49.171
You know, I wouldn't.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.873
What's there to talk about, really?

09:50.941 --> 09:52.407
You guys are supposed
to be broken up, right?

09:52.510 --> 09:53.540
Oh, that's true. I just...

09:53.948 --> 09:57.330
- I don't know. Women are confusing.
- Yeah, try living with one.

09:57.382 --> 09:59.215
I did. I was married, remember?

09:59.284 --> 10:00.951
Oh, yeah. Well, I never have,

10:00.986 --> 10:04.854
and, uh, I'm finding it,
uh, very enlightening.

10:04.957 --> 10:05.855
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.223
Enlightening how?

10:07.292 --> 10:09.060
Well, like how April's this
total mess of contradictions.

10:09.281 --> 10:11.081
I mean, for someone who's
got it together so tight,

10:11.116 --> 10:13.717
man, you should see how she
fawns over this blowhard Blair.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.085
Dude is unbelievably arrogant

10:15.120 --> 10:16.920
and also crazy boring at the same time.

10:16.989 --> 10:18.455
It makes no sense why she's into him.

10:18.557 --> 10:20.457
Sounds like you might be into her.

10:20.526 --> 10:21.558
- April?
- Unh-unh.

10:21.594 --> 10:23.627
Oh, that's good 'cause, uh...

10:23.729 --> 10:26.163
she might be a bit out of
your league, mate. No offense.

10:26.232 --> 10:27.664
Okay, okay, I'll have you know

10:27.733 --> 10:29.800
I've enjoyed my fair
share of beautiful women.

10:29.902 --> 10:31.535
But it never ceases to amaze me

10:31.637 --> 10:33.737
how easily they fall for the classic douche

10:33.806 --> 10:35.906
with the $100 haircut and tricked out cars.

10:35.941 --> 10:39.009
- Scott bought Joss a Tesla.
- My point exactly.

10:39.044 --> 10:41.178
You know, maybe you shouldn't
focus so much on, uh,

10:41.213 --> 10:43.580
understanding women as, you know...

10:43.649 --> 10:45.148
- having sex with one of them.
- Okay, dude.

10:45.217 --> 10:46.850
No, I'm saying this as a friend, mate.

10:46.885 --> 10:48.752
- How long has it actually been?
- I don't know. Not that long.

10:48.821 --> 10:51.221
Really? How long have you been
living in another woman's home

10:51.257 --> 10:53.423
and sharing your bunk bed
with your 6-year-old nephew?

10:53.492 --> 10:54.705
Well, Scotty's with my mom for the week,

10:54.706 --> 10:56.340
so I've got the bunk bed all to myself.

10:59.264 --> 11:01.398
Okay, yeah.

11:01.433 --> 11:04.501
Some sex would be good.

11:13.912 --> 11:15.145
Soccer practice after school?

11:15.213 --> 11:16.379
Yep. See you later, Mom.

11:16.448 --> 11:18.615
Mwah.

11:19.951 --> 11:21.151
You look happy.

11:21.219 --> 11:23.153
Blair, hi!

11:23.188 --> 11:24.721
Must've gone well with your mom.

11:24.790 --> 11:28.391
Um, actually, it was a disaster.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.126
My mom and I got into a huge fight,

11:30.195 --> 11:31.261
and she left early.

11:31.329 --> 11:33.530
But I still think her
visit was a good thing.

11:33.565 --> 11:35.498
Lucy and I are in a much better place.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.500
And for that, I am eternally grateful.

11:37.569 --> 11:39.269
Well, I'm sorry about you and your mom.

11:39.304 --> 11:41.438
Uh, maybe I can make up
for that error in judgment.

11:41.506 --> 11:43.673
Guess who got floor seats
to the Lakers game tonight.

11:43.742 --> 11:44.641
- Floor seats?
- Mm.

11:44.709 --> 11:45.842
Hello, Mr. Fancy.

11:45.877 --> 11:48.111
Perks of being a headmaster
at a private school.

11:48.180 --> 11:49.446
Laker kids.

11:49.481 --> 11:51.514
Any chance I can interest
you and Lucy in joining me?

11:51.583 --> 11:53.883
Me and Lucy?

11:53.952 --> 11:55.885
Unless you think it's
too soon to include her.

11:55.954 --> 11:58.154
I don't want to rush that
step. I know it's important.

11:58.223 --> 11:59.956
I don't think we're rushing.

11:59.991 --> 12:02.158
I... I think it feels right on time.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.359
Good.

12:05.263 --> 12:06.329
That's weird.

12:06.364 --> 12:07.764
It's a little early for
Karen to be calling me.

12:07.799 --> 12:08.832
Answer it. I'll text you later.

12:08.934 --> 12:10.767
Mmm.

12:14.439 --> 12:15.872
Hey, Karen.

12:18.376 --> 12:19.409
The body of Luca Raines

12:19.478 --> 12:21.077
was discovered early this morning.

12:21.146 --> 12:23.546
At this point, no arrests have been made.

12:23.582 --> 12:25.782
Local law enforcement are
still gathering evidence.

12:25.851 --> 12:27.050
Back to you, Donna.

12:30.755 --> 12:32.222
You'd think that more news outlets

12:32.324 --> 12:33.289
would be covering this.

12:33.358 --> 12:34.691
Here. Drink this. It'll calm your nerves.

12:35.994 --> 12:37.427
Have you heard from Calista yet?

12:37.496 --> 12:38.761
No, which is weird.

12:38.797 --> 12:40.029
But I'm just... I'm glad she's okay.

12:40.098 --> 12:41.331
I honestly thought she might be dead.

12:44.369 --> 12:45.401
The fact the police
haven't called me yet...

12:45.470 --> 12:46.903
that's good, right?

12:46.972 --> 12:48.238
It means they probably
found the real killer.

12:48.306 --> 12:49.305
If they really thought it was me,

12:49.374 --> 12:50.406
wouldn't they have called me by now?

12:50.475 --> 12:52.075
Try to stop spinning, Joss.

12:52.144 --> 12:55.044
I know how you're feeling.
Believe me, I've been there.

12:55.113 --> 12:57.213
Yeah, but Elizabeth confessed
to killing Sam right away.

12:57.315 --> 12:58.948
You were never really a suspect, were you?

12:59.017 --> 13:01.618
The police made me feel like I
was, even with her confession.

13:01.686 --> 13:03.586
There's so much red tape.

13:03.622 --> 13:06.189
It takes a lot longer than you think.

13:06.291 --> 13:08.124
I still can't believe this is happening.

13:08.193 --> 13:10.193
I mean, it just doesn't...
doesn't feel real, you know?

13:10.262 --> 13:11.628
It's gonna be okay.

13:11.696 --> 13:13.363
Is it bad that I wanna call Harry?

13:13.431 --> 13:16.566
I mean, I... I called him.
He didn't call me back.

13:16.635 --> 13:17.834
And I know we're broken up.

13:17.869 --> 13:19.903
I just feel like this
is special circumstances.

13:20.005 --> 13:21.971
If that will make you feel better.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.274
Or maybe you shouldn't.

13:24.376 --> 13:25.775
Why shouldn't I?

13:25.844 --> 13:28.778
Just... because, you know?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.748
No, I don't know. What's going on?

13:31.816 --> 13:33.416
In... in the grand scheme of things,

13:33.485 --> 13:35.118
I don't even think it really matters.

13:35.187 --> 13:36.753
Tell me, April. What?

13:39.858 --> 13:41.891
Harry slept with some girl.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.326
What?

13:43.428 --> 13:45.261
What girl?

13:45.330 --> 13:48.131
I think her name is... Niko?

13:48.233 --> 13:51.501
Unbelievable.

13:51.536 --> 13:53.002
I'm so sorry. Should I not have told you?

13:53.104 --> 13:54.971
I just didn't want you calling him

13:55.040 --> 13:56.606
and feeling worse about everything.

13:56.675 --> 13:58.174
No, no, I'm just... I'm
I'm glad you told me.

13:58.210 --> 13:59.709
I'm just literally in a
state of shock right now.

14:03.515 --> 14:06.816
Karen. Come on. Answer your phone.

14:06.885 --> 14:08.885
It's okay. It's just Vivian.

14:08.954 --> 14:10.887
No, go and deal with your life, okay?

14:10.956 --> 14:13.623
I'm just gonna be sitting
here, watching TMZ.

14:13.725 --> 14:14.591
It's not like you can do anything for me

14:14.693 --> 14:16.226
right now anyway.

14:16.294 --> 14:17.994
The singer has so many
girlfriend admirers...

14:18.063 --> 14:19.529
I'll watch TMZ with you.

14:19.598 --> 14:21.464
Just last night, two of them...

14:21.566 --> 14:24.067
Hey, Vivian.

14:25.437 --> 14:26.703
Huh.

14:26.771 --> 14:28.338
So you were having a drink at the Ace Hotel

14:28.406 --> 14:29.739
at 1:30 in the morning.

14:29.808 --> 14:31.541
You usually out that late on a weeknight?

14:31.576 --> 14:34.877
I... I work seven days a week.
Every night is a weeknight.

14:34.946 --> 14:37.146
Okay. And you were alone?

14:37.215 --> 14:40.516
I was with my friend Denise.
I already told you that.

14:40.585 --> 14:43.052
Right. Denise. Hairstylist. Sorry.

14:43.121 --> 14:46.089
Just... notes are all
kind of mixed up here.

14:46.157 --> 14:52.528
Okay, so let's move on to
your publicist, Josslyn Carver.

14:52.597 --> 14:54.697
Joss is my party planner.

14:54.766 --> 14:56.799
My publicist is Lauren Sweeney.

14:56.901 --> 14:59.202
I will make a note.

14:59.271 --> 15:03.373
So... about this plan that
you and Joss hatched...

15:03.441 --> 15:05.074
What plan?

15:07.712 --> 15:09.812
Detective Cannon took a statement

15:09.914 --> 15:12.882
from Josslyn last night
where she mentioned a plan

15:12.951 --> 15:15.451
that you and she made to
catch your husband cheating.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.488
I'm sorry. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:20.725 --> 15:21.958
You had no idea that

15:22.027 --> 15:24.327
Josslyn Carver was in bed
with your husband last night?

15:24.396 --> 15:26.729
I don't believe that to be true.

15:26.831 --> 15:28.298
You don't believe?

15:32.504 --> 15:34.804
What if I showed you a tape
that could prove it were true?

15:34.906 --> 15:36.606
I'd have to see it to believe it.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.975
Joss would never do
something like that to me.

15:39.077 --> 15:43.513
Sit tight, Mrs. Raines. I'll be right back.

15:52.237 --> 15:54.136
Seriously, how gorgeous is she?

15:54.190 --> 15:55.757
8 pounds. That's big, isn't it?

15:55.825 --> 15:56.991
I think it's pretty average.

15:57.060 --> 15:58.393
Oh, I bet it doesn't feel average

15:58.461 --> 16:00.094
when you're pushing it out of your hoo-ha.

16:00.163 --> 16:02.163
Vivid, honey. Thank you for that image.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.500
Are you okay?

16:05.568 --> 16:08.069
Did I drive you crazy
leaving you so many messages?

16:08.138 --> 16:10.471
Not at all. I'm sorry I couldn't answer,

16:10.540 --> 16:12.607
but I've just been so preoccupied.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.475
But I do wanna hear about your trip.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.377
Ah, it's pretty much all baby stuff.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.913
What about you guys? What'd
you do while I was gone?

16:20.417 --> 16:23.251
Not much. Was on call. Poker game.

16:23.319 --> 16:26.287
Karen and I had lunch.

16:26.389 --> 16:28.056
That's nice.

16:29.726 --> 16:32.160
Hey, talk to me about your friend.

16:32.228 --> 16:34.028
Is there anything I can do?

16:34.097 --> 16:36.130
Ali knows a few good lawyers.

16:36.166 --> 16:39.067
I can't tell if we're there yet.

16:39.102 --> 16:40.768
And I don't wanna make
Joss any more anxious

16:40.804 --> 16:42.003
than she already is.

16:44.074 --> 16:46.941
But I am worried that
she's in over her head.

16:47.010 --> 16:51.612
She's got you, which means
she's already at an advantage.

16:54.617 --> 16:56.284
I missed you.

16:56.352 --> 16:59.520
I missed you more.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.061
Oh, April, you really don't
have to clean up after me.

17:08.131 --> 17:09.363
I'll do it later.

17:09.465 --> 17:11.132
I don't mind.

17:18.575 --> 17:20.108
Hello?

17:20.175 --> 17:25.079
Uh... This is Josslyn.

17:25.147 --> 17:27.281
Right now?

17:27.349 --> 17:30.118
Uh, sure. Bye.

17:32.255 --> 17:33.888
They want me to come down to the station.

17:33.990 --> 17:35.490
I'm going with you.

17:35.558 --> 17:36.524
No, no, no. I...

17:36.593 --> 17:38.226
I don't know how long that's gonna take.

17:38.328 --> 17:40.361
And I don't want you to
miss your Lakers game.

17:40.463 --> 17:41.529
Don't be crazy.

17:41.564 --> 17:44.832
It's not like you can
go in the room with me.

17:44.868 --> 17:47.401
I promise you, I'll call
you when I'm done, okay?

17:49.072 --> 17:52.440
Hey. You're not allowed
to be more scared than me.

17:52.509 --> 17:54.442
I can't help it.

17:54.511 --> 17:56.110
You're my family, Joss. I love you.

17:56.179 --> 17:57.812
Oh, honey.

17:57.914 --> 18:00.781
I love you, too.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.260
Yeah, that's, uh, nice. Very smooth.

18:12.328 --> 18:14.128
Isn't it? It's distilled from a combination

18:14.197 --> 18:16.898
of organic potatoes and the finest grains.

18:16.966 --> 18:18.299
Potatoes, huh? That's, uh...

18:18.334 --> 18:20.134
That's very, uh, interesting.

18:20.236 --> 18:21.469
But you know what?

18:21.504 --> 18:22.937
Marc is actually the best
man to make this decision.

18:23.006 --> 18:24.305
He's my top bartender. Hey, Marc?

18:24.407 --> 18:25.540
Yo! You got a sec?

18:25.608 --> 18:28.109
Mm. Have you guys met? Marc, this is Ever.

18:28.178 --> 18:31.045
We have definitely never
met. I would remember you.

18:31.114 --> 18:32.713
You just stole my line.

18:34.150 --> 18:37.818
So what are we selling today... Ever?

18:37.887 --> 18:39.854
Only the finest vodka money can buy.

18:39.923 --> 18:41.822
But, uh, you don't have to pay me.

18:41.891 --> 18:44.125
One of my favorite sentences right there.

18:45.328 --> 18:47.361
Talk to me about this vodka.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.264
Sure.

18:50.366 --> 18:53.901
Uh... Oh, look. The tap is on.

18:54.003 --> 18:56.103
- Excuse me.
- Why don't you try it?

18:56.206 --> 18:58.039
And then you tell me what you think.

18:58.107 --> 19:01.042
Mm, that's too easy.

19:01.146 --> 19:03.080
Get me drunk, and I'll buy anything.

19:03.148 --> 19:07.351
I prefer to be drawn
in. Seduced, if you will.

19:09.154 --> 19:12.055
Describe how it tastes,
how it makes you feel.

19:12.157 --> 19:15.959
Well, I would be happy to seduce you.

19:16.028 --> 19:18.895
Why don't we start with the fact

19:18.964 --> 19:23.767
that we use the oldest legal
distillery in the country?

19:23.869 --> 19:25.736
The oldest?

19:25.804 --> 19:27.204
Mm-hmm.

19:55.768 --> 19:57.601
- Josslyn Carver?
- Yeah.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.136
Follow me, please.

20:00.372 --> 20:03.307
Thanks, April. I'm on my way home now,

20:03.375 --> 20:05.709
so I'll be there when she gets back.

20:05.778 --> 20:07.878
Sounds good. Okay.

20:10.949 --> 20:13.083
Viv's on the phone with her sister.

20:13.185 --> 20:14.951
I gotta get back to the hospital, so...

20:15.020 --> 20:16.386
See you there?

20:16.422 --> 20:19.690
Uh, actually, I need to be
home for Joss tonight, so...

20:19.758 --> 20:23.393
Right. Well... maybe tomorrow, then.

20:23.495 --> 20:24.861
Alec...

20:24.930 --> 20:27.798
I hope you didn't keep anything
from Vivian because of me.

20:27.866 --> 20:30.500
Like I said, I'm happy to follow your lead.

20:30.602 --> 20:32.069
I didn't lie for you.

20:32.104 --> 20:34.938
I lied 'cause I don't want to hurt my wife.

20:35.007 --> 20:36.973
I don't wanna hurt her either.

20:37.042 --> 20:40.010
I know you don't. I...
I'm not mad at you, Karen.

20:40.045 --> 20:44.448
It's just... this whole situation...

20:44.516 --> 20:47.184
I know.

20:52.858 --> 20:54.424
Good luck with your friend.

21:04.436 --> 21:08.305
Hmm. Okay. And how much
time would you say took place

21:08.374 --> 21:10.741
between the power being
cut and you finding Luca?

21:10.809 --> 21:12.175
Okay, just to be clear, I didn't realize

21:12.244 --> 21:13.910
that the power was cut. I
thought it was a blackout.

21:13.979 --> 21:15.812
So between the blackout
and you getting downstairs,

21:15.881 --> 21:17.114
was it one minute, two minutes?

21:17.182 --> 21:19.216
I... I don't know. Maybe... two minutes?

21:19.284 --> 21:21.451
I was looking for my
shoes, and it was dark.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.019
Why'd you need your shoes?

21:23.088 --> 21:24.454
Because they're my shoes.

21:24.523 --> 21:26.623
They're a little on the pricey side.

21:26.692 --> 21:28.258
Were you afraid that
Calista might find them?

21:28.360 --> 21:30.026
Of course not.

21:30.062 --> 21:33.029
No, because Calista knew that
you were there the whole time.

21:33.098 --> 21:35.232
Yes. Right.

21:35.334 --> 21:37.134
Is this frustrating for you?

21:37.236 --> 21:39.336
No. I... I just...

21:39.438 --> 21:40.971
I... I feel like I'm
saying the same exact thing

21:41.039 --> 21:42.205
over and over again, that's all.

21:42.274 --> 21:46.309
Well, your story is
mostly consistent, but...

21:46.378 --> 21:47.511
see, when we showed the video

21:47.579 --> 21:49.045
of you and Mr. Raines in the bedroom,

21:49.114 --> 21:51.815
Mrs. Raines appeared so shocked.

21:51.884 --> 21:54.351
She... what?

21:54.453 --> 21:56.420
And deeply hurt, I might add.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.889
That's crazy. Calista was a
part of the plan the whole time.

21:58.991 --> 22:00.524
Part of the plan to kill Luca?

22:00.626 --> 22:02.659
What?

22:02.761 --> 22:04.027
No. I...

22:04.129 --> 22:05.529
What was the plan, then?

22:05.631 --> 22:10.534
Okay, I... I... I think
I... I want a lawyer present.

22:10.636 --> 22:13.270
That's okay. We're done for the time being.

22:13.372 --> 22:15.071
You're free to leave.

22:18.444 --> 22:20.243
But I wouldn't go too far.

22:27.602 --> 22:28.702
Do you guys think

22:28.770 --> 22:29.869
we have a chance of seeing Ashton Kutcher?

22:29.905 --> 22:31.438
Well, I've seen him at games before.

22:31.506 --> 22:33.073
I've also seen Justin Timberlake.

22:33.175 --> 22:34.374
I will die.

22:34.443 --> 22:37.711
I remember the first
basketball game I ever went to.

22:37.779 --> 22:40.046
I was 7 or 8, and my dad warned me

22:40.082 --> 22:42.315
that we were gonna be sitting
in the nosebleed section.

22:42.350 --> 22:43.917
But I had no idea what that meant,

22:43.952 --> 22:45.485
so the whole ride over, I was terrified

22:45.554 --> 22:47.153
that my nose was gonna start bleeding

22:47.255 --> 22:48.388
when we got to the game.

22:49.891 --> 22:52.559
Lucy, your mother is talking.

22:52.627 --> 22:53.693
Oh, that's okay.

22:53.729 --> 22:54.961
Don't you think you should listen

22:55.030 --> 22:57.097
when your mom's telling a story?

22:57.199 --> 22:58.565
I am listening.

22:58.633 --> 22:59.833
Put the phone away.

22:59.901 --> 23:02.068
Please.

23:02.137 --> 23:04.537
Okay.

23:04.606 --> 23:06.239
You were saying?

23:06.341 --> 23:09.542
Oh. I was finished, actually.

23:11.646 --> 23:13.246
Why would Calista lie like that?

23:13.348 --> 23:14.914
It makes no sense.

23:15.016 --> 23:16.883
Maybe she didn't lie.

23:16.985 --> 23:19.018
Maybe the police are just saying that.

23:19.121 --> 23:21.171
They could be using you to
get to her, or vice versa.

23:21.183 --> 23:22.159
- No.
- You don't know.

23:22.174 --> 23:23.407
You should've seen the
way she looked at me.

23:23.475 --> 23:24.808
It was so weird, and the fact that

23:24.910 --> 23:26.643
- she didn't call me back, Karen?
- Maybe...

23:26.679 --> 23:29.579
- What? Maybe what?
- Well, look at it from her perspective.

23:29.648 --> 23:32.516
You were the last person
to be seen with her husband.

23:32.584 --> 23:34.651
Maybe she thought things got rough?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.053
What? Do you...

23:36.088 --> 23:38.789
Do you think that she
thinks that I killed Luca?

23:38.824 --> 23:41.658
I don't know. I'm just trying
to put myself in her position.

23:43.462 --> 23:46.430
Oh, finally.

23:46.498 --> 23:47.631
Wilson, hi.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.933
Calista's assistant.

23:49.968 --> 23:52.336
Yes! Yeah, I'd...

23:52.404 --> 23:54.104
I'd be happy to meet her.

23:54.173 --> 23:57.040
No, I... I would love to meet her. Where?

23:57.142 --> 23:59.209
Okay. I'm on my way.

23:59.278 --> 24:00.711
Do you need me to come with you?

24:00.813 --> 24:02.212
No. This I can handle.

24:05.017 --> 24:06.950
Oh. Hi.

24:06.985 --> 24:09.753
Hi. Who... are you?

24:09.822 --> 24:11.888
I'm Vivian.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.223
You must be Joss.

24:13.292 --> 24:16.193
Oh, my god! You're Vivian! It's...

24:16.295 --> 24:17.861
It's so nice to meet you.

24:19.198 --> 24:22.065
Mm. I wish that I could stay, but I...

24:22.167 --> 24:24.201
- You've got things. I know.
- Yeah.

24:24.303 --> 24:25.502
Have a good night.

24:25.571 --> 24:28.538
Totally get it, by the way.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.006
I like her.

24:30.109 --> 24:31.608
Everyone does.

24:31.643 --> 24:33.777
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

24:33.846 --> 24:35.245
It's just...

24:35.347 --> 24:36.413
can we talk?

24:50.696 --> 24:51.962
Yo.

24:52.030 --> 24:53.997
Send a good bubbly over
to table 3, would you?

24:54.099 --> 24:56.833
- Dude, Ever wants to come over after work.
- Who?

24:56.935 --> 24:58.468
- Vodka?
- Yeah.

24:58.504 --> 24:59.836
Yes!

24:59.938 --> 25:01.738
- I mean, excellent.
- No, it's not excellent.

25:01.774 --> 25:03.340
I can't exactly bring
her back to April's house.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.775
And something tells me
L.A. ladies aren't too keen

25:04.843 --> 25:06.009
on hooking up in a motor home.

25:06.078 --> 25:07.978
Yes, they're a snobby breed. It's true.

25:08.046 --> 25:09.646
All right, know what?

25:09.715 --> 25:11.047
You can use my place.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.116
That's... I can't do that.

25:13.218 --> 25:14.785
There's a spare key under
the paint can by the garage.

25:14.853 --> 25:16.553
- Knock yourself out.
- Oh!

25:16.622 --> 25:17.954
You're the best, eh?

25:18.056 --> 25:19.256
That's awkward.

25:19.324 --> 25:20.991
I promise to make it fast, man.

25:21.093 --> 25:22.426
Okay.

25:23.896 --> 25:26.263
Yes!

25:27.533 --> 25:31.435
Is everything okay? I wasn't expecting you.

25:31.583 --> 25:35.085
Did something happen with
you and Alec while I was away?

25:35.153 --> 25:36.753
You always cut right to the chase.

25:36.822 --> 25:38.588
Byproduct of thinking I was gonna die.

25:38.657 --> 25:40.090
No time to waste.

25:40.158 --> 25:43.426
So... did you two have sex?

25:45.464 --> 25:46.863
Did Alec say that?

25:46.932 --> 25:50.433
No, but he's been acting
strange ever since I got home,

25:50.536 --> 25:51.835
and you've been acting strange.

25:51.870 --> 25:53.837
But I know you've got so
much happening with Joss,

25:53.872 --> 25:57.007
so I wasn't sure if maybe
I was being paranoid.

25:58.977 --> 26:00.610
You're not being paranoid.

26:02.184 --> 26:03.316
Wow.

26:03.418 --> 26:07.253
I guess I was kinda hoping I was wrong.

26:07.356 --> 26:08.254
I'm sorry.

26:08.357 --> 26:09.990
I should've said something earlier,

26:10.025 --> 26:11.925
but I thought it was Alec's place.

26:11.994 --> 26:16.896
And honestly, I wasn't
even sure if it mattered.

26:16.965 --> 26:19.466
Of course it matters.

26:21.903 --> 26:23.069
Are you angry?

26:23.138 --> 26:25.372
No.

26:25.474 --> 26:26.506
Yes.

26:28.710 --> 26:32.112
I just feel gross. I
don't know why, but I do.

26:32.270 --> 26:34.503
Vivian, please don't go.

26:34.572 --> 26:37.373
I wish you weren't so beautiful, Karen.

26:37.442 --> 26:40.276
Sometimes I think I'm jealous of that.

26:40.458 --> 26:43.993
We should all talk this out together.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.028
Maybe...

26:46.330 --> 26:48.063
But not right now.

26:48.165 --> 26:51.400
Right now I just wanna go home.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.067
I'm telling you, he is an
incredibly famous actor.

27:01.169 --> 27:02.469
That old guy? I've never seen him.

27:02.571 --> 27:04.671
"A Few Good Men." "The Shining."

27:04.739 --> 27:06.272
No idea what you're talking about.

27:07.442 --> 27:08.942
But thanks again for the seats.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.376
You're welcome, Lucy.

27:10.479 --> 27:12.445
Yes, thank you. It was amazing.

27:12.481 --> 27:14.581
Well, I'm glad you had fun.

27:17.919 --> 27:20.053
Is something wrong?

27:20.155 --> 27:21.221
No.

27:21.289 --> 27:24.991
Well, yes. I feel like I should just say it

27:25.060 --> 27:26.559
so it doesn't become a thing.

27:26.595 --> 27:28.595
Although now it already feels like a thing,

27:28.630 --> 27:30.263
which is silly, because it is so not.

27:30.298 --> 27:31.598
Tell me what's on your mind.

27:31.633 --> 27:34.000
I want you to always be honest with me.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.569
I feel like you were a little hard on Lucy

27:36.638 --> 27:38.037
about the texting thing.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.539
Disciplining her should be my job.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.840
Well, I agree.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.309
I was surprised when
you didn't say anything.

27:43.345 --> 27:45.411
Didn't it bother you what she was doing?

27:45.447 --> 27:48.114
I mean, yeah, a little, but
it's such a minor offense.

27:48.183 --> 27:49.949
Considering everything
we've been through lately,

27:50.018 --> 27:51.417
why upset her?

27:51.486 --> 27:54.153
Well, I apologize if I crossed a line.

27:54.189 --> 27:57.423
I... I raised my daughter
before texting was invented,

27:57.492 --> 27:59.192
so I may have overreacted.

27:59.227 --> 28:01.127
But I don't think you should worry

28:01.162 --> 28:02.996
about Lucy being upset with you.

28:03.064 --> 28:04.831
- She's about to be a teenager.
- Mm.

28:04.866 --> 28:07.300
Being upset with you is
gonna be her full-time job.

28:07.402 --> 28:08.401
I know.

28:08.470 --> 28:11.004
Boundaries are critical at this age.

28:11.039 --> 28:12.405
You must do this for a living or something.

28:12.907 --> 28:15.375
Or something.

28:26.221 --> 28:27.687
Don't worry. I'm not sleeping over.

28:27.722 --> 28:28.922
I wish you could.

28:28.990 --> 28:30.523
- It's just that...
- No, it's cool.

28:30.559 --> 28:31.824
I have a dog who will pee everywhere

28:31.893 --> 28:33.293
if I don't get home soon.

28:39.534 --> 28:42.068
Why do you have a picture
of Harry Davis on your shelf?

28:42.170 --> 28:44.437
Hmm? Oh, that's, uh...

28:44.472 --> 28:48.374
This is Harry Davis' apartment, isn't it?

28:48.443 --> 28:49.776
Uh, this is gonna seem strange,

28:49.844 --> 28:52.111
but, uh, my place is being fumigated.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.480
Is this Harry Davis' bed?

28:54.583 --> 28:56.449
I wish you wouldn't keep
saying his whole name like that.

28:56.518 --> 28:57.750
You don't understand.

28:57.786 --> 29:00.053
I've had a crush on him since
I pitched him Jagermeister

29:00.121 --> 29:01.354
at Savannah's kitchen.

29:01.423 --> 29:02.822
He was married then.

29:02.924 --> 29:05.091
Is he...

29:05.193 --> 29:06.459
He's not.

29:06.561 --> 29:08.127
So he's single?

29:08.196 --> 29:09.696
Look, I'm still naked here, so maybe...

29:09.798 --> 29:12.799
Right. No, I... I'm sorry.

29:12.901 --> 29:15.535
I'm just so excited.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.238
Um, well, that was fun!

29:19.307 --> 29:20.907
You were fun!

29:22.477 --> 29:24.143
You're his bartender, right?

29:24.245 --> 29:25.111
Mm-hmm.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.379
That is so cool.

29:26.481 --> 29:28.214
Good for you.

29:28.283 --> 29:30.984
Well, um, maybe, uh...

29:31.019 --> 29:34.921
put in a good word to him for me?

29:34.990 --> 29:36.422
If you want.

29:36.491 --> 29:38.224
No pressure.

29:38.326 --> 29:40.493
Okay, bye.

29:55.477 --> 29:57.977
Hi, Alec.

29:58.079 --> 30:00.747
Yep. Be right there.

30:20.929 --> 30:22.094
Hey.

30:23.564 --> 30:26.298
Close the door.

30:28.569 --> 30:30.503
You all right?

30:30.571 --> 30:32.238
No, I am not all right.

30:32.306 --> 30:34.240
I'm not all right.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.643
And neither are you.

30:37.945 --> 30:39.545
We're being investigated for murder now.

30:39.614 --> 30:40.779
I know.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.482
Mm. What did you tell the cops?

30:43.584 --> 30:45.251
I told them the truth.

30:45.353 --> 30:46.719
Why would you do that?

30:46.754 --> 30:48.020
What do you mean?

30:48.055 --> 30:51.590
I didn't know where you
were. I was worried about you.

30:51.659 --> 30:53.325
I was at the Ace Hotel getting drunk,

30:53.427 --> 30:54.860
what any normal person would do

30:54.962 --> 30:56.495
when they allow their best friend

30:56.597 --> 30:58.297
to go and make out with their husband.

30:58.366 --> 30:59.932
Okay, but you didn't tell me
that you were gonna do that,

30:59.967 --> 31:00.899
- so I was...
- And you didn't tell me

31:01.002 --> 31:03.369
that he was gonna end up killed.

31:03.437 --> 31:05.771
I didn't kill him.

31:05.873 --> 31:07.740
Calista.

31:07.808 --> 31:09.608
I know.

31:09.710 --> 31:11.076
Okay, good,

31:11.145 --> 31:13.946
because I just wanna make
sure that you don't think that.

31:13.981 --> 31:16.982
All right, well, now we have a situation.

31:17.051 --> 31:20.586
Yeah. I know. But maybe if
you just tell the truth...

31:20.688 --> 31:21.854
Are you crazy?

31:21.922 --> 31:25.557
I'm gonna tell them that
I was part of a... a scam

31:25.626 --> 31:26.893
to trick my cheating husband

31:26.908 --> 31:28.175
so I don't have to pay him alimony?

31:28.630 --> 31:30.763
I'm practically giving them a motive,

31:30.832 --> 31:33.566
plus I will be crucified in the press.

31:33.635 --> 31:35.701
- Yeah, but it...
- But... but nothing.

31:35.804 --> 31:38.271
I already gave them my
story. I can't change it now.

31:38.339 --> 31:41.040
Okay, so where exactly does that leave me?

31:41.109 --> 31:43.176
Why did you tell them the truth?

31:43.278 --> 31:46.746
I'm sorry! I've never been in
a situation like this before!

31:46.815 --> 31:47.880
We need to get you a lawyer.

31:47.982 --> 31:48.915
We need to get you a good lawyer.

31:48.983 --> 31:50.183
I will pay for everything.

31:50.251 --> 31:52.418
I don't want you to pay for
a lawyer for me, Calista.

31:52.487 --> 31:53.953
I want you to be my friend.

31:54.022 --> 31:55.922
Look, they have nothing on you.

31:56.024 --> 31:57.123
You have no motive.

31:57.192 --> 31:59.325
You were just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.127
Yeah, but they think that
I'm lying. Do you understand?

32:01.196 --> 32:02.528
And you refusing to tell the truth

32:02.630 --> 32:04.230
makes me look like I'm lying.

32:04.365 --> 32:05.431
I understand that,

32:05.533 --> 32:08.000
but do you understand
that I have no choice?

32:08.102 --> 32:10.636
No, you do have a choice.
You absolutely have a choice.

32:10.738 --> 32:12.939
I know it makes things
harder for you, but...

32:13.041 --> 32:14.340
I am not going down for this

32:14.442 --> 32:16.876
because you're too stupid
to keep your mouth shut.

32:19.347 --> 32:21.948
Oh, don't. I didn't mean it like that.

32:22.050 --> 32:23.216
I can help you.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.984
I don't want your help.

32:35.399 --> 32:36.899
Stop. Stop.

32:37.001 --> 32:38.166
God, you're the one that
got us into this mess.

32:38.235 --> 32:39.401
- Got you into this mess?
- Yes!

32:39.503 --> 32:40.836
- That... that's what we're going with?
- Yes!

32:40.905 --> 32:41.770
I didn't know you were
an unwilling participant

32:41.839 --> 32:43.872
in this relationship.

32:43.908 --> 32:47.409
- Wow!
- I cannot believe you went to her without me.

32:47.444 --> 32:49.595
- I...
- Don't you do that to her.

32:49.596 --> 32:50.176
This is not Karen's fault.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.513
I went to her because I knew

32:51.548 --> 32:52.781
that she and I could have
a measured conversation,

32:52.816 --> 32:55.250
whereas I knew you would
immediately become defensive.

32:55.319 --> 32:57.785
I'm not defensive. I'm angry.

32:57.887 --> 32:59.862
I understand why you're upset.

32:59.882 --> 33:02.116
And for the record, I wouldn't be angry

33:02.151 --> 33:04.185
if you'd at least come to me first.

33:04.253 --> 33:05.486
Aren't I at least owed that?

33:05.672 --> 33:07.005
But you were the one who made
the decision to lie to me.

33:07.273 --> 33:08.940
Stop! Everyone, stop!

33:09.008 --> 33:11.742
It doesn't matter how this all came out.

33:11.778 --> 33:14.779
What matters is how we deal
with things moving forward.

33:14.881 --> 33:16.113
Exactly.

33:16.249 --> 33:17.848
We need to establish some rules

33:17.884 --> 33:20.651
so no one ever gets hurt like this again.

33:20.687 --> 33:23.788
Good idea. Honestly, I think
I was more upset about the fact

33:23.823 --> 33:25.790
that you both felt the
need to keep this from me.

33:25.858 --> 33:27.224
That makes perfect sense.

33:27.260 --> 33:30.094
I'm sorry. What in the hell
are you two talking about?

33:30.129 --> 33:32.863
I had sex with another woman
when you were out of town,

33:32.932 --> 33:35.366
and the only thing you're mad
about is I didn't tell you?

33:35.435 --> 33:37.068
Do you know how insane that sounds?

33:37.103 --> 33:39.603
You've been having sex with
another woman for weeks, Ali.

33:39.639 --> 33:41.072
That's obviously not the issue.

33:41.140 --> 33:44.542
Well, I think it is. It is for me.

33:46.646 --> 33:48.546
I can't do this anymore.

33:48.614 --> 33:50.348
- Ali...
- No, I'm done.

33:50.383 --> 33:52.950
It's too much.

33:53.019 --> 33:54.251
I'm scared.

33:56.289 --> 33:59.323
Karen, you know how much I care about you,

33:59.392 --> 34:02.660
and obviously I'm very attracted to you.

34:02.729 --> 34:04.128
But, Vivian, you are my wife.

34:04.163 --> 34:08.099
I chose you to spend
the rest of my life with.

34:08.167 --> 34:10.001
And I'm worried the longer we stay in this,

34:10.103 --> 34:12.136
whatever this is,

34:12.170 --> 34:14.304
everything we have may fall apart.

34:14.340 --> 34:17.808
I think we've been falling
apart for a while, Ali.

34:17.909 --> 34:19.476
That's not true.

34:19.545 --> 34:21.245
Before Karen came into our lives,

34:21.313 --> 34:23.214
you and I were practically roommates.

34:23.248 --> 34:26.050
We both know a marriage
can't survive the way we were.

34:26.119 --> 34:28.552
Without Karen,

34:28.621 --> 34:31.589
I'm not sure it won't go
back to being the same.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.725
Oh, I'm betting on us.

34:36.195 --> 34:37.628
I think we can find our way back.

34:37.730 --> 34:40.197
At least... I wanna try.

34:42.101 --> 34:45.101
Don't you?

34:47.572 --> 34:49.407
Karen...

34:49.509 --> 34:52.943
No, Vivian.

34:52.978 --> 34:54.512
It's okay.

34:55.848 --> 34:58.516
He's right.

35:11.364 --> 35:12.463
Hey.

35:12.565 --> 35:14.231
I come bearing breakfast.

35:16.602 --> 35:18.803
Hmm. You wouldn't have any
chocolate chips lying around,

35:18.905 --> 35:19.904
would you?

35:20.039 --> 35:21.172
Yeah, in the cupboard.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.773
Sit, sit, sit. I got it.

35:25.978 --> 35:27.845
You're back.

35:27.947 --> 35:30.247
Oh, you were doubting my
waffle skills last night,

35:30.349 --> 35:31.415
so I came to prove you wrong...

35:31.484 --> 35:32.850
unless you don't like chocolate chips.

35:32.919 --> 35:33.951
No, I like 'em.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.152
Mm, I thought you might.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.623
It's Joss. Give me two minutes.

35:39.725 --> 35:41.759
Take your time.  Sit.

35:46.265 --> 35:47.765
Here you go, Lucy.

35:47.834 --> 35:48.766
Thank you.

35:50.269 --> 35:52.503
You know, I'm proud of you.

35:52.572 --> 35:53.871
For what?

35:53.906 --> 35:55.372
Keeping up your end of the bargain.

35:55.475 --> 35:56.807
A happy home is a 2-way street.

35:56.843 --> 35:58.576
The more you treat your mom with respect,

35:58.644 --> 36:00.578
the easier it'll be for
your mom to do the same.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.113
Yeah, that makes sense.

36:05.885 --> 36:08.052
Mnh-mnh. You don't reach.

36:09.655 --> 36:11.622
You ask.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.657
"May I please have the syrup?"

36:13.726 --> 36:17.061
May I please have the syrup?

36:17.163 --> 36:20.631
Of course.

36:27.206 --> 36:30.241
Hey. You're bloody late.

36:30.343 --> 36:31.709
I had a night.

36:31.777 --> 36:34.178
Did ya?

36:34.247 --> 36:35.546
All right, let's hear it.

36:35.648 --> 36:38.749
Unfortunately, it wasn't exactly
the night I was hoping for,

36:38.818 --> 36:40.551
but, uh, she did...

36:40.620 --> 36:42.586
ask me to give you her number.

36:42.688 --> 36:44.889
No.

36:44.957 --> 36:45.856
Yeah.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.458
Oh, mate. Sorry.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.894
Oh, these things happen.

36:49.962 --> 36:51.328
You know I would never go there, right?

36:51.397 --> 36:54.031
Oh, it doesn't matter.
It's not so much about her.

36:54.066 --> 36:57.368
It's... it's more the
fact that you were right.

36:57.436 --> 36:59.236
Really? What was I right about?

36:59.272 --> 37:01.572
The other day, when you called me a loser.

37:01.641 --> 37:04.642
What are you talking about?
I never called you a loser.

37:04.710 --> 37:06.443
I had to use your apartment to get laid.

37:06.512 --> 37:10.080
I mean, that's the basic
definition of loser.

37:11.217 --> 37:13.117
I mean, the point is,

37:13.219 --> 37:15.085
why would April ever go for a guy like me?

37:15.188 --> 37:16.420
I got nothing.

37:16.489 --> 37:18.656
Come on, mate. You got plenty...

37:18.724 --> 37:21.358
What? Wait a minute.

37:24.063 --> 37:26.063
Pretty sure you said you
didn't have feelings for April.

37:26.132 --> 37:27.331
Even if I did, it doesn't matter.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.066
She's all about that Blair guy.

37:29.135 --> 37:31.535
And why shouldn't she be? He's
got everything figured out.

37:31.604 --> 37:33.771
He takes her to nice dinners and whatever.

37:33.873 --> 37:35.973
He's much more her speed.

37:36.042 --> 37:37.241
Not if he's a douche.

37:37.310 --> 37:38.609
Yeah, well, maybe he's not.

37:38.678 --> 37:40.978
Maybe I'm just jealous,
you know? Who knows?

37:41.080 --> 37:42.213
Okay.

37:42.248 --> 37:44.481
You're being way too hard
on yourself here, mate.

37:44.584 --> 37:47.518
Come on. Just relax.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.086
Have a beer.

38:14.614 --> 38:16.580
And the way she turned it all around,

38:16.682 --> 38:17.881
it was literally genius.

38:17.950 --> 38:18.916
I was up all night long,

38:18.985 --> 38:20.184
thinking that I did the wrong thing,

38:20.253 --> 38:21.518
that maybe me telling
the truth was a mistake.

38:21.587 --> 38:23.087
- That's crazy.
- It... it is crazy.

38:23.155 --> 38:24.722
But that's what crazy people are good at...

38:24.757 --> 38:26.323
making you feel like you're the crazy one.

38:26.392 --> 38:29.360
Well, we knew about the plan.
We can corroborate your story.

38:29.395 --> 38:30.828
Yeah, oh, my best friends
corroborating my story.

38:30.930 --> 38:31.929
I don't think that's gonna fly.

38:32.031 --> 38:33.030
Was there anyone else who knew?

38:33.099 --> 38:34.431
No, I only told you guys.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.300
I can't imagine she told anyone.

38:36.369 --> 38:37.234
Although there... there was the guy

38:37.303 --> 38:38.369
who installed the camera.

38:38.437 --> 38:39.336
We were both there when he did it.

38:39.405 --> 38:40.504
He could at least verify that much.

38:40.573 --> 38:41.905
Well, maybe that's
enough to cast some doubt

38:42.008 --> 38:43.807
on Calista's version of things.
What company did you use?

38:43.909 --> 38:46.677
Oh! I... I don't know.
It was one of her guys.

38:46.746 --> 38:47.845
Do you remember anything?

38:47.913 --> 38:49.613
A business card? A logo on his shirt?

38:49.649 --> 38:51.982
No, I... I... nothing. I don't
even remember what he looked like.

38:52.018 --> 38:53.651
A credit card would show the transaction.

38:53.719 --> 38:55.085
You could subpoena those records.

38:55.154 --> 38:57.354
She always pays in cash. I'm so screwed!

38:57.390 --> 39:00.024
What kind of a person
does something like this?

39:00.092 --> 39:02.826
People with Cluster B personality disorder.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.162
Please don't shrink out on me
right now, Karen. In English.

39:05.231 --> 39:06.730
It's a form of narcissism.

39:06.799 --> 39:08.532
People who are excessively preoccupied

39:08.601 --> 39:10.734
with power, prestige, and vanity

39:10.803 --> 39:12.670
can become mentally unable to see

39:12.738 --> 39:15.839
the destructive damage they're
causing to themselves or others.

39:15.908 --> 39:17.875
So, what? She's some kind of sociopath?

39:17.943 --> 39:19.176
Technically, no.

39:19.245 --> 39:22.513
Oh, my god! She's totally a sociopath.

39:22.581 --> 39:25.349
Well, you know what else
sociopaths do? Kill people.

39:25.418 --> 39:27.851
- Wait. I did not say...
- No, I'm saying that.

39:27.920 --> 39:30.354
What if Calista is the killer?

39:31.324 --> 39:33.624
No, you guys, it totally makes sense.

39:33.659 --> 39:35.759
I mean, it makes absolute sense.

39:35.795 --> 39:38.095
She hated Luca. She eally hated him.

39:38.164 --> 39:39.797
He was gonna take everything
from her in the divorce.

39:39.865 --> 39:41.298
If that's not a motive,
I don't know what is.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.633
- Joss...
- And then that night?

39:42.702 --> 39:44.301
Guys, I was texting her and texting her

39:44.370 --> 39:46.103
to see if we got everything
that we needed on the camera,

39:46.172 --> 39:47.771
and she just never responded.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.873
- What? What do you mean?
- I texted her a few times,

39:49.909 --> 39:51.108
- and she didn't write back.
- And then...

39:51.177 --> 39:52.843
The lights went out.

39:52.912 --> 39:55.212
Oh, my god.

39:55.247 --> 39:57.081
What if she was in the
house the whole time?

39:57.149 --> 39:59.116
What if the reason that
she didn't write me back

39:59.185 --> 40:00.784
was because she was too
busy cutting the power,

40:00.853 --> 40:02.353
getting ready to kill Luca?

40:05.691 --> 40:08.125
Do you really think she's capable of that?

40:08.194 --> 40:11.762
I don't know. I really don't know.
