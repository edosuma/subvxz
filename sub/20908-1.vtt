00:56.757 --> 00:59.693
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:04.232 --> 01:06.634
Ely Braxton!

01:25.619 --> 01:28.356
What you are about to see
is

01:28.389 --> 01:31.625
ro-de-o history!

04:25.999 --> 04:28.336
-Hey, Joe.
-How's Ely?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.703
He's good.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.710
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, Joe.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.846
Did I leave the prescription?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.848
Just like a wedding night.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.616
Not my wedding night.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.786
Here it is.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.856
Let's get some coffee brewing.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.660
HANK: There.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.932
-There you go.
-Watch the leg.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.703
Now's the best time for us to
get him thinking, while he's
got the pain.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.639
He's not gonna listen to
no doctor, and he's not
gonna listen to me.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.441
That makes two of us.

05:24.758 --> 05:29.463
Check it out, son!
It don't get better than this.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.936
You know, it's funny.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.838
It could've been anything,
from what I hear.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.710
Football, baseball, wrestling.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.845
You just chose bull riding,
is all.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.448
Could've chose anything.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.518
You still can, you know.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.420
No.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.522
Choosing time's come and gone.

05:55.923 --> 06:00.594
Well, maybe for riding bulls
or baseball,

06:00.628 --> 06:03.464
but there's all sorts of other
things to look forward to,

06:03.497 --> 06:05.365
all kinds of other choices
to make.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.770
Never chose bull riding,
Connie.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.506
It just sort of chose me.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.945
That might make it easier to
let it go then.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.881
-Don't you think?
-It might.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.485
We'll see.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.820
CONNIE: I don't think there's
any other way to see it.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.088
Are you two okay?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.160
CONNIE: The doctor was
pretty clear about that.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.430
ELY: Yeah.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.469
Go on, take it down.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.071
-What?
-The poster.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.606
Take it down.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.841
You sure?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.444
I'm sure.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.233
HANK: I started out
a bull rider, ended up
a bullfighter.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.002
Best goddamn decision
I ever made.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.505
PRCA bullfighting
hall-of-famer

07:51.539 --> 07:53.040
and a few other things I could
mention if I wanted to.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.276
Hold up now.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.080
Point is, I've been doing this
for 15 years on both sides
of the chutes.

08:00.113 --> 08:04.117
I can tell you one thing for
certain, there's only two
ways to ride a bull.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.087
You can either make it happen,
or you can let it happen.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.823
There's been a few champs
that have made it happen

08:09.857 --> 08:14.962
but the really great riders,
the guys that have ridden
hard and long,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.865
guys like George Paul,
Gary Leffew,

08:17.898 --> 08:20.534
those guys just let it happen.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.771
Are you giving them the
"you have to dance
with the bulls" speech again?

08:23.804 --> 08:27.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Ely Braxton
is back.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.815
And he'll be the first
to tell you, it starts here.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.284
You've gotta clear your heart
and your head,

08:38.318 --> 08:42.022
so that when you get on
that bull, you've already won.

08:42.054 --> 08:45.726
It's just a dancing partner.
You just gotta be man enough
to let it lead.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.161
You've gotta be able to have
enough confidence in yourself,

08:48.195 --> 08:52.099
and faith that you can
sit back and let it happen.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.867
It's attitude, pure attitude.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.137
Whether you're
making a putt,

08:57.170 --> 08:58.639
whether you're riding
a bull...

08:59.807 --> 09:00.741
Attitude.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.044
That's what separates
the best from the rest.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.680
-Let's go.
Clean up the arena.
-All right.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.683
Stay focused. Real simple.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.689
HANK: Remember what
we talked about.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.225
Clear your head.
Don't force anything on him.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.828
Just react, okay? Okay.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.964
-He's ready to dance,
so are you.
-Okay, man, let's go.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.622
(HORN BLOWS)

09:53.661 --> 09:55.362
(HANK YELLS)

09:55.395 --> 09:56.997
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:58.031 --> 09:59.332
Shit!

10:00.701 --> 10:02.803
Get up. We gotta go to work.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.072
-What?
-We gotta go to work.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.912
I gotta pick up Connie
to do the vaccines.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.114
You guys need anything else
from town?

10:14.147 --> 10:16.083
Shots already? Seems like
we just did them.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.251
-Always does.
-What?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.788
-The shots.
-The shots!

10:20.821 --> 10:22.890
Got it. We gotta do the shots.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.658
You started it, man.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.995
Thanks, Mom.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.131
Hey, Doc.

10:57.290 --> 11:01.228
Hold. Hold. Okay, he's safe.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.464
-Where's Zapata?
-Who cares? He's a dud.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.367
No one's ever ridden him.
Besides, he needs
his vaccination.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.336
You won him in a card game.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.839
It don't matter.
He needs his vaccination.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.274
-Turn this one out
and go get him.
-All right.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.178
Move! Move!

11:20.480 --> 11:23.751
Guys, roll up Zapata.
Move, bull.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.421
Damn!
He's a big son of a buck.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.825
Yeah. I wouldn't worry
about him. He's all bark,
no bite.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.428
I'm just gonna
center this for you.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.269
Ely!

11:42.302 --> 11:44.337
CONNIE: What the hell are
you doing? Get off!

11:45.538 --> 11:46.807
Ely!

11:46.840 --> 11:49.376
What do you got, huh? Nothing!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.845
What you got? Nothing!

11:51.879 --> 11:54.114
Ely, get off the bull.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.183
-Get off!
-This thing can kick, man!

11:56.216 --> 11:59.386
Get off. You wanna
ride him, or you want me
to turn him out?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.154
Hell no. Turn him out.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.490
What are you talking about?
Get on this thing!

12:03.523 --> 12:05.826
-Ely, get off the bull.
-I'm getting off.

12:05.859 --> 12:06.994
Go!

12:40.460 --> 12:41.929
Watch out. Look at him.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.375
Nice dancing, brother.
He nipped you, too.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.278
Thank God for my sneakers.
That's one hell of an athlete.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.451
Number 24 and 21,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.119
pick up your orders.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.922
-What?
-Damn.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.091
I think I got a cavity.
Take this.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.827
-Do you put nutmeg
or clove on it?
-Clove.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.563
-How do you know?
It's nutmeg.
-It's definitely clove.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.232
-You're a vet, not a dentist.
-It's clove.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.234
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

13:21.268 --> 13:24.104
What do you put on a cavity,
nutmeg or clove?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.538
-Clove.
-She says nutmeg.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.507
You're still gonna have
to get that looked at.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.910
Yeah, when I get back.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.912
-Back from where?
-Salinas.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.148
Hank's taking some bulls.
I thought I'd give him a hand.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.218
Huh. When did you decide
on the Salinas thing?

13:38.251 --> 13:41.588
Well, I need a change.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.992
I need to do something new.
The ranch is getting old.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.428
What's new about
a rinky-dink rodeo in Salinas?

13:48.461 --> 13:52.365
It's just about being there,
being with some of the guys
and being around it.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.367
Well, that's not new.
That's old.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.508
If you want new,
I got plenty of ideas.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.876
Oh, yeah? Like what?

14:04.311 --> 14:07.080
You know,
you've been incredible.

14:07.114 --> 14:11.484
You got hurt, and just went
on getting better,
getting on with your life.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.586
You made it look
a lot easier than it's been.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.190
It's been hard, I know.
Hard as hell.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.360
Well, I got hurt sooner
than I wanted to.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.596
But sooner or later,
most guys get hurt.
That's just the way it is.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.085
You're gonna get carsick.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.555
Shit. I thought I downloaded
this stuff.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.490
What?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.293
There it is.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.629
"A used Huntley trailer
in excellent condition."

14:56.663 --> 14:59.666
I figure we can use Zapata
to frontline us up with PBR,

15:00.968 --> 15:03.036
five or six shows, and then...

15:05.538 --> 15:08.308
Yeah, that's plenty
for a down payment.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.411
Zapata's gonna be a star.
We're gonna get paid
our breeding fees.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.146
We might even get him on TV.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.115
They got an agency
for that kind of shit.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.927
I bet you a hundred dollars
that no man can ride
that bull.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.698
I don't doubt your eye
for talent,

15:31.731 --> 15:34.467
but I got Put Hustead's bull
back in the pens.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.469
Ray, talk to him for me.

15:36.503 --> 15:40.207
How many times have
I driven all night to fill in
a slot for you guys?

15:40.240 --> 15:43.343
I know that.
But I'm telling you,
Pat ain't gonna like this.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.513
Pat doesn't have to know
about it. This ain't
a sanctioned event.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.281
Hell, it's just
a draw pot, right?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.552
For Christ sakes, guys!
I'm talking about one bull!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.469
Okay. This is what I'll do.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.738
I'll fight for you tomorrow,
free of charge.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.675
All right. All right.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.710
I'll tell you what.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.747
You bring him, and if there's
any re-rides, he's in.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.382
How's that, huh?

16:23.716 --> 16:24.717
Okay.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.754
Thank you, guys.

16:27.787 --> 16:32.559
-Thanks. We'll see you
bright and early.
-Nice to see you, Ray.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.262
Great to have you back, kid.
Can't wait to see
you ride tomorrow.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.164
-I'm not gonna ride.
-You're not?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.601
Don't even think about it.
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:43.303 --> 16:46.139
Yep, they always come back.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.577
Long as they can walk.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.212
God, I love 'em.

17:05.657 --> 17:08.361
Gather around ladies
and gentlemen. Welcome to
Salinas, California.

17:08.395 --> 17:12.065
We have the thrills,
spills and chills
of a professional rodeo...

17:14.666 --> 17:18.805
HANK: So he gets in one
of these umpire masks,
his nose is completely mashed.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.675
Guess what bull he draws?
Knock Him Out John.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.546
Son of a bitch gets out
the chute, he turns
back around, and whack!

17:26.579 --> 17:29.182
Ely Braxton, you big dumb dog.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.084
Welcome home.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.753
Hey, Jed. We was just talking
about you.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.755
I was telling the boys
about that umpire mask.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.694
Goddamn thing nearly turned me
into a Belgian waffle.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.364
Braxton, keep your hand out
of the money pot, you hear?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.733
I'm riding for alimony
these days.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.336
-Who'd you draw?
-I didn't.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.673
Doctor's orders.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.276
We got bigger fish to fry.
Next five years,

17:56.309 --> 17:59.179
you boys are all gonna
be riding Braxton bulls.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.714
You watch.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.418
Yeah, you watch. You watch.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.420
I gotta go get some gas.
I'll see you later.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.190
We're only gonna be
a couple hours, so don't
be late, okay?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.268
Oh, come on. Please?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.921
Bull!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.890
ANNOUNCER:
Nobody yet made
a qualified ride.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.593
Let's go down
to chute number seven.
Here's Rough And Ready.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.596
He's... No! Another one down!

18:49.629 --> 18:53.366
I've seen some bull riding
before, but these guys are
really bringing it up.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.703
-Hey, Ray.
-Hey!

18:56.736 --> 18:58.838
ANNOUNCER:
He made the whistle.
What are ride we'll see there.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.240
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

19:03.943 --> 19:06.246
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.718
Hell, yeah, boy. Right here.

19:11.751 --> 19:16.456
ANNOUNCER: There's no buck
in him. He's just standing,
waving to the crowd.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.293
The Yuma, Oklahoma cowboy,
Tom Sharples, they're gonna
give him a re-ride.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.395
Stu, Ray.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.396
Pen six.

19:27.734 --> 19:30.169
Kid in chute two.
Let's go with him.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.644
ANNOUNCER:
The young man getting
on this bull

19:37.677 --> 19:40.480
has not been on a bull
for over a year.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.686
A serious injury kept him
out of competition.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.456
His brother Hank,
his dad Reid,

19:49.489 --> 19:51.724
both performed
in the rodeo business.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.796
Ladies and gentlemen,
over here in chute number two

19:56.829 --> 20:00.300
is Ely Braxton
from Santa Maria, California

20:00.333 --> 20:03.270
on a bull they call Doomsday!

20:05.438 --> 20:06.973
Let's watch him ride!

20:10.277 --> 20:11.878
HANK: Hang on!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.288
Son of a bitch.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.631
(HORN BLOWS)

20:36.869 --> 20:38.805
Stay! Stay!

20:38.838 --> 20:40.573
Come on! Go, go!

20:42.309 --> 20:44.644
ANNOUNCER:
Eighty-eight points!

20:44.677 --> 20:47.013
Eighty-eight points
for Ely Braxton!

20:47.046 --> 20:49.616
I don't know whether
to hug you or hit you,
you son of a bitch!

20:49.649 --> 20:51.684
-Great ride!
-Yeah!

20:51.718 --> 20:54.487
Welcome back, my friend.
You ain't missed a day.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.308
Zapata, don't let me down.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.879
There you go.
You have a good ride.

21:31.558 --> 21:34.026
ANNOUNCER:
I've been in the business
a long time

21:34.060 --> 21:37.797
and Zapata's one of
the rankest bulls I've seen.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.566
I told you, Ray!

21:50.677 --> 21:53.713
-Five thousand.
-No, I'm sorry.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.649
-Ten thousand.
-I'm sorry. I can't.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.085
I can't sell this bull.
He's my future, okay?

21:59.118 --> 22:02.555
Fifteen grand, and my wife.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.794
Is that for me or Zapata?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.530
What exactly were
your thoughts
when you got back on the bull?

22:10.563 --> 22:12.465
I don't know.
Stay on, I guess.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.867
How did you prepare?

22:14.901 --> 22:18.004
I didn't.
I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.673
What does your father think
about you coming with
a metal plate in your skull?

22:21.808 --> 22:22.609
It's not metal.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.382
-It's good to have you back.
-It's good to be back.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.119
-See you at the truck.
-Thanks a lot.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.454
Take care.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.633
You made a mistake today.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.602
I don't know.
It felt pretty good.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.938
I ain't talking
about your ride.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.541
You're a big boy.
I ain't gonna judge
you for that.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.444
I'm talking
about the reporter.

22:59.178 --> 23:02.482
-What if it makes
the papers back home?
-Don't worry. It won't.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.552
You better hope it doesn't.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.557
Mom, Connie, they'll skin you.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.961
-It was a hell
of a ride though.
-Thanks.

23:14.994 --> 23:18.130
Sure do know how
to sit on a bull.
It must be God given.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.135
Answer me one question.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.640
What's it mean to you in here?

23:30.710 --> 23:31.711
I don't know.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.549
You will.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.607
Morning.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.881
Use a glass.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.726
(SIGHS)

24:21.661 --> 24:23.229
So, is it true?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.535
Is what true?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.870
Ow!
What'd you do that for?

24:34.073 --> 24:37.076
-I'm sorry.
-You have done me in.
You really have.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.646
I was just trying to find
the right time to explain it
to you.

24:39.679 --> 24:43.115
Just done me in.
Just know that.
You've done me in!

24:43.149 --> 24:45.618
Well, you know what?
It felt great!

24:54.193 --> 24:55.562
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

24:57.797 --> 24:59.999
Ely, come here, boy.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.569
Come on. Now watch, Ely.

25:02.602 --> 25:06.839
Take ahold of this, and watch.
Squeeze the trigger real slow.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.908
-Piece of cake, Dad.
-Okay, son.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.144
Cowboy up.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.013
Reid, what are you doing?

25:14.046 --> 25:15.047
(GUN FIRES)

25:19.018 --> 25:20.019
Go!

25:21.187 --> 25:23.255
Come on, Rose.
It's just a bit of fun.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.661
What the hell? Put that down.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.897
-Go on! Get outta here!
-Come on, Rose.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.595
We're gonna need ten CC's
of penicillin.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.597
-Okay.
-Make him feel
real good later.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.737
-Hey.
-Hi, liar.

26:14.206 --> 26:17.977
Dr. Fremont, Ely Braxton.
He's a liar.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.879
He's also dumb enough
to ride a bull
with half his skull missing.

26:21.147 --> 26:24.651
-Maybe I should step...
-No. It's okay.

26:24.684 --> 26:25.752
You should go. We're busy.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.659
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.396
Ely, I'm serious!

26:37.429 --> 26:39.766
If you lie like that,
where does it stop?

26:39.799 --> 26:42.101
Come on. Don't make this
such a big deal.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.171
I haven't done anything.
You lied to me.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.407
After everything we've been
through this year, you can't
give me the real you.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.743
I'm still trying to find
my way back.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.945
-I swear I didn't see
it coming.
-Don't do that.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.981
I didn't know.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.951
Do you want me to lie
to you to make you think that
I'm telling the truth?

26:58.985 --> 27:01.821
It's so scary.
I'm standing here with you
in front of me

27:01.854 --> 27:03.222
and I don't even know
who you are.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.825
If you don't, nobody does.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.794
Including me.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.198
That's a terrible
thing to say.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.402
I'm sorry.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.983
MAN: (ON TV)
In the late '70s,

27:31.017 --> 27:33.252
the Mitchell technique made
its first appearance
on the circuit

27:33.285 --> 27:36.789
with Reid Braxton
leading the way.

27:36.823 --> 27:40.927
While the technique involved
a pronounced shift forward
in the riding position,

27:40.960 --> 27:45.297
it was best known
for its credo, "Cowboy up."

27:45.331 --> 27:47.433
An all-strength,
take-no-prisoners attitude

27:47.466 --> 27:50.102
which is being demonstrated
by Reid Braxton here.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.745
(ELY GRUNTING)

28:12.759 --> 28:13.993
Thanks, Mom.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.095
You gotta talk to him.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.300
-Talk to who?
-Ely. He's out there packing.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.436
Somebody's got to talk
some sense into him.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.506
Mom, Ely and I get along

28:27.539 --> 28:30.442
because I never daddied him,
I'm not about to start now.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.311
He's healed up fine.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.213
I promise you, I'll take care
of him, okay?

28:35.214 --> 28:36.282
Stop worrying.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.031
-Where do you want these?
-Over there is fine.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.499
Thanks.

28:57.103 --> 29:00.206
Well, the good news is,
I'm done worrying about you,
Ely.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.312
But if you get hurt,
you don't come back here
again.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.880
You understand?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.916
Socks go in the other drawer.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.488
Go. Go see him.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.793
You're a grown man. Do it.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.230
No, thanks.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.900
I'm sure Hank has the address
up there somewhere.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.235
This has nothing
to do with Dad.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.841
You're not him, Ely!
You're you!

29:35.374 --> 29:36.943
God bless you for that.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.879
Bye.

29:43.149 --> 29:43.950
Bye.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.636
(LINE RINGING)

30:07.239 --> 30:09.441
This is Connie.
I'm not in right now.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.477
Leave me a message, or
you can try me at the clinic.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.584
-No Connie?
-Nope.

30:22.588 --> 30:27.159
-Check the clinic?
-No. She's probably busy.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.229
Yeah, she's probably
with that doctor, getting rug
burns on her ass.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.921
What are you looking for?

30:57.689 --> 31:00.026
Oh, there's this girl I know.
She ain't there.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.428
-Is this her rig?
-It's pretty nice, isn't it?

31:02.461 --> 31:03.862
It's real nice.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.083
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.019
Hey, Celia.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.921
-How you doing?
-Good.

31:28.955 --> 31:31.123
You doing an exhibition
or something?

31:31.157 --> 31:34.560
I am selling barbecue sauce.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.534
There's someone
I want you to meet.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.037
-My brother, Ely.
-Nice to meet you.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.239
Nice to meet you.
You're the one
that hurt your head.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.975
-That's right.
-This is Sophie.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.046
What about having dinner
with us tonight?

31:54.080 --> 31:55.047
Sounds good.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.384
You're on, Miss Jones.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.352
Gotta go. Bye.

Grab that for me. Push "talk."

32:08.294 --> 32:11.630
No, she's gone into the arena.

Here she is,

32:14.166 --> 32:18.170
the world's champion,
Celia Jones.

32:18.204 --> 32:21.173
Damn. They better be paying
her a lot of money.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.509
The joke is,
she's a vegetarian.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.112
-I wouldn't have put you
two together.
-That's why it works.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.381
Tell you the truth,

32:29.415 --> 32:31.283
with a woman like that,
most guys are just scared
of them.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.619
Probably for a good reason,
don't you think?

32:33.652 --> 32:36.088
-Well, they gotta love
somebody.
-And that'd be you?

32:37.356 --> 32:38.390
Why not?

32:44.530 --> 32:45.331
Hello?

32:49.801 --> 32:53.172
Hey, thanks.
I'm sorry. Dinner's off.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.543
Maybe we'll hook up
in Carson City or something.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.181
Sounds good. Nice to meet you.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.549
-Bye, Celia.
-Bye-bye.

We got our bullfighters
over here.

33:56.435 --> 33:59.071
Dinner's back on if you guys
wanna hang out.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.341
That'd be great.
That'd be great.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.645
-Mario's at 8:00?
-Yeah.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.049
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.530
Seems stupid to bring
me along.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.199
Au contraire.
It's the slow approach.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.838
In matters of love,
brotherly accompaniment
equals respect.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.206
You go in slow
like an iceberg

34:35.241 --> 34:38.143
and by the time
she knows what's happening,
it's too late.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.811
That sounds more
like war than love.

34:39.844 --> 34:43.349
-Love is war.
-You're so romantic.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.317
How's your year been, Ely?

34:45.351 --> 34:47.585
-Pretty good.
-Yeah?

34:47.619 --> 34:50.722
He's been getting checks.
Wrangler called and made
him an offer.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.725
They've really been beefing up
their budget this year.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.694
It's not exactly like
they're giving the money away.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.466
I don't know how you guys
deal with the judge thing.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.667
The judge thing?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.603
You know, the judges
give the scores.

35:04.636 --> 35:08.207
It's like ice skating
or boxing.
Where's the win in that?

35:10.709 --> 35:14.112
If you watched enough,
you'd be able to tell
the winners from the losers.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.515
Really?

35:16.548 --> 35:17.816
I'll take that, please.

35:21.487 --> 35:24.156
-Are you all through?
-Yes, thank you.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.559
I'm sorry.
We don't take credit cards.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.228
-You've gotta be kidding.
-I'm sorry.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.167
They call this a restaurant.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.303
I'm gonna take a pit stop.
I'll see you guys out front.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.771
Sure. It was nice to meet you.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.773
-You're not coming with us?
-No, I'm gonna walk.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.776
Okay. See you.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.911
I'll meet you outside.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.188
-You got any cash?
-No. You said dinner was
on you.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.257
That's when I thought t
hey took credit cards.
I don't have any cash.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.726
Bit of a tight spot, eh?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.595
Shit!

36:03.629 --> 36:05.497
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.867
I love you,
you son of a bitch.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.369
Go get her.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.842
Oh, she loves that.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.713
-You ever get a massage?
-Every chance I get.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.582
You?

36:23.615 --> 36:26.184
Once. It was kind of like
a gift certificate.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.954
And?

36:28.987 --> 36:32.524
Son of a bitch damn near
put me in the hospital.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.393
And then during the whole
thing, I keep feeling
something dripping on me.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.930
Then I realized
the guy was sweating.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.266
It was a guy?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.569
You got a massage from a guy?

36:45.737 --> 36:46.538
Yeah.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.344
Not a sports massage. I mean,
I get massages from guys.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.312
I didn't know you guys did.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.316
Well, I didn't either.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.357
Give me a hand here?

37:08.927 --> 37:12.831
-Nicely done.
-Thanks.

37:12.864 --> 37:16.835
It was nice to meet
your brother. You guys
are pretty different, though.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.705
Yeah. Ely's a good kid.
He just gets tangled up
sometimes.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.412
Thanks for dinner.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.447
Good night.

37:30.782 --> 37:35.287
Hey, I was thinking about
that massage stuff
we were talking about earlier.

37:35.321 --> 37:38.390
The deal with that was,
it was a gift certificate

37:38.424 --> 37:40.392
and so I kind of felt awkward.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.594
'Cause if it were me,
you know,

37:42.628 --> 37:46.398
I would've asked
for someone else,
like a woman.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.737
You are so funny.
Don't worry about it.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.772
-Good night.
-Night.

38:20.065 --> 38:23.335
I don't know, man.
She gives me a bad feeling.

38:23.369 --> 38:25.437
Why?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.605
She never looks you
in the eye.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.442
She's shy.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.512
That's part of why I love her.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.013
Yeah? What's the other part?

38:36.948 --> 38:38.417
You know, I've been thinking.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.755
I don't think this clown
thing's helping me.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.824
You're not a clown.
You're a bullfighter.

38:47.526 --> 38:50.629
Well, next time we go out,

38:50.662 --> 38:53.031
remind me to talk more
about the stock contracting.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.366
Gee, that'll grab her.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.071
Any woman that makes you feel
like you have to explain
yourself

39:00.105 --> 39:01.640
is the wrong woman.

39:14.152 --> 39:18.924
-Where the hell did you
pick that up?
-My feet?

39:18.957 --> 39:22.528
Ever watch that James Bond
movie where they painted
that lady in gold?

39:22.561 --> 39:25.431
-She suffocated.
-I thought it was
lead poisoning.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.035
No. Her skin couldn't breathe,
something like that.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.003
Shit, I don't know.
I've just always done it.

39:40.779 --> 39:41.580
Hey.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.348
What?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.918
What's the old man been up to
these days?

39:47.853 --> 39:50.021
I don't know.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.890
Probably just waiting around
to go to hell.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.565
Do you think he knows?

40:04.670 --> 40:07.639
I mean,
do you think he knows
how we've done?

40:14.012 --> 40:15.180
Probably.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.230
Gotta do it, boy.
He ain't going nowhere.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.933
-He might make it.
-Come on!

40:34.966 --> 40:37.669
This is your last chance
to put some hair
on your balls.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.571
-He's gonna make it!
-Get outta here.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.007
Ely, come here, boy.

40:53.552 --> 40:54.853
Good night, little big man.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.809
Hey, hey.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.178
Come on, Ely. You all right?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.009
(MOUTHING)

41:54.813 --> 41:57.182
Have you ever been
with a zookeeper, Ely?

41:57.215 --> 42:01.620
'Cause this girl had
a funny smell, but she had
the best body I ever saw.

42:14.966 --> 42:20.105
This is Connie. I'm not
in right now. Please leave
a message.

42:20.138 --> 42:24.209
ANNOUNCER:
Poor Randy Frost has drawn
Zapata, the unridden bull.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.911
Randy gets started,

42:25.944 --> 42:27.646
but whoop, he's down!

42:35.186 --> 42:38.123
Now in the winners' circle,
we see the familiar faces
of Ely Braxton

42:38.156 --> 42:40.158
along with Celia Jones,
with another buckle.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.564
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

43:07.819 --> 43:11.690
"After the wreck, the closest
I ever thought I was gonna get
to a bull

43:11.723 --> 43:14.860
"was cleaning out the stalls
back home," Braxton said.

43:14.893 --> 43:18.196
-I never said that.
I never said that.
-Here we go.

43:18.229 --> 43:21.933
"Ely blames his busy schedule
on keeping he and his father
apart.

43:23.702 --> 43:25.904
"Although he says
he phones him often."

43:25.937 --> 43:28.339
Damn, that is such bullshit.

43:28.373 --> 43:31.777
Relax, cowboy. I'm just
enjoying some fine journalism.

43:34.012 --> 43:35.881
They always find a way
to bring Dad into it.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.893
-Hey, how are you?
-How are you?

43:47.926 --> 43:50.628
-Are you guys in the rodeo?
-Yes.

43:52.898 --> 43:54.900
What's this?
Do you want me to sign it?

44:02.874 --> 44:04.810
How you guys doing?

44:06.211 --> 44:07.713
About ready to go?

44:26.765 --> 44:29.367
You coming in or going out?

44:29.400 --> 44:31.002
Great. Great.

44:57.162 --> 44:58.296
Son of a bitch.

45:00.431 --> 45:03.501
Sorry. Did I wake you?

45:03.534 --> 45:06.437
'Cause I was just trying
to figure out, while you were
having fun last night,

45:06.471 --> 45:09.908
I spent my night freezing
my ass off in this truck.

45:09.941 --> 45:13.444
Yeah. And while you've
been sleeping, I've had to do
all the driving.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.246
I'd like to know how
the hell that works.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.948
It works well.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.418
I bet it does.

45:33.031 --> 45:34.099
-Hey.
-I don't believe it.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.768
How are you?

45:36.802 --> 45:38.236
Ooh. How are you?

45:39.237 --> 45:40.538
Good. It went well.

45:40.571 --> 45:43.541
I'm glad to hear that.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.777
-Where's your brother?
-Right behind me.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.881
I'm gonna go put
some coffee on. Be right back.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.455
Hey, Ma. What do you think?

45:57.488 --> 45:59.324
-Whose it is?
-It's mine.

46:00.025 --> 46:00.859
Yours?

46:02.961 --> 46:05.263
-You look like hell, kid.
-Thanks.

46:05.296 --> 46:06.497
You look great, as always.

46:11.236 --> 46:14.806
Come here. Give me a hug.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.175
You're all in one piece, huh?
Are you?

46:17.208 --> 46:19.210
Yep, I'm great. You all right?

46:19.244 --> 46:23.414
-Yeah, I'm all right.
-Let's go.

46:23.448 --> 46:27.886
I think I'm gonna sign
a contract with Wrangler,
Ford, and Bud Light.

46:27.919 --> 46:31.389
He's got Southwest coupons,
too. He's been doing
really good.

46:31.422 --> 46:33.491
A good showing in Nashville
ought to sew up the PBR

46:33.524 --> 46:36.361
and then he can quit
and come back and help us
with the ranch.

46:36.394 --> 46:39.397
Maybe. But there's always
something to be said
for sticking with it.

46:39.430 --> 46:41.266
I wanna keep my edge.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.068
Well, we could use your help
back here too.

46:44.602 --> 46:47.238
Maybe I'll do like
a back-and-forth or something.

46:47.272 --> 46:49.274
Let's not get
all confused about

46:49.307 --> 46:52.077
what people are doing
or aren't doing.

46:52.110 --> 46:54.112
Joe and I are working out
just fine here.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.182
You and Joe, huh?

46:57.215 --> 46:58.884
Things getting a little lonely
at the ranch?

47:08.059 --> 47:09.861
You best not forget
what's important.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.968
Home, sweet home.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.151
-Hi.
-Hi.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.321
That's my shirt.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.890
You're wearing my T-shirt.

47:38.924 --> 47:41.126
-What are you doing here?
-I'm home for the Fourth.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.628
-Oh...
-Here, I got this for you.

47:43.661 --> 47:47.165
-Thanks.
-Go on. Open it.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.067
Connie, do we have
a miniature Phillips-head
screwdriver?

47:51.402 --> 47:54.005
Gene, you guys remember
each other? Ely.

47:56.274 --> 47:57.275
Sure.

47:57.976 --> 48:00.045
Howdy.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.348
These model 1740s,
it takes a degree
to figure them out.

48:03.381 --> 48:06.117
Do we have one of those
little, tiny, miniature...

48:06.151 --> 48:07.052
Under the sink.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.956
Excuse me?

48:10.989 --> 48:12.523
There's a toolbox
under the sink
with a screwdriver in it.

48:14.359 --> 48:15.593
Great. Thanks.

48:22.133 --> 48:24.002
-Is that yours?
-Yeah. You like it?

48:24.669 --> 48:26.071
It's nice.

48:29.975 --> 48:31.709
You wanna come inside?
We're just hanging out.

48:31.742 --> 48:33.211
No, thanks.
Maybe another time.

48:36.982 --> 48:39.317
Why don't you just
come back tomorrow,
bring this.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.086
We'll make a plan,
try to do this right.

48:46.457 --> 48:47.592
No, thanks.

48:49.027 --> 48:50.695
You're incredible!

48:50.728 --> 48:53.531
You're gone for two months,
you don't even call

48:53.564 --> 48:56.267
and then you show up
out of the blue and act
like I'm a bitch.

48:56.301 --> 48:59.170
-I called a lot.
-No, you didn't.

48:59.204 --> 49:01.239
-You only called once.
-That's not true.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.674
I left a message once.
I called lots of times.

49:03.708 --> 49:05.710
Oh, that is lame!

49:05.743 --> 49:07.945
I can't believe you!
That is so lame!

49:27.398 --> 49:29.667
If Zapata keeps rolling
along the way he is,

49:29.700 --> 49:33.238
I'd like to take some
of that cash, maybe put
something together.

49:33.271 --> 49:35.173
Like a book?

49:35.206 --> 49:38.176
I was thinking more
like a video. I want something
that says it all.

49:38.209 --> 49:40.211
There's a lot of guys teaching
a lot of different things,

49:40.245 --> 49:42.580
but it's all based
on power and strength.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.016
There's nothing wrong
with a little effort.

49:45.050 --> 49:49.054
Are you kidding me?
Have you seen some
of these guys in the chutes?

49:49.087 --> 49:52.457
All muscled up.
They don't know a single thing
about bull riding.

49:52.490 --> 49:56.194
Take Denny Presser,
for example. Pulls his biceps
clean off the bone.

49:56.227 --> 49:58.563
Never thinks
he's gonna ride again.

49:58.596 --> 50:02.333
I work with him, get him
to focus on balance,
stretching, visualization.

50:02.367 --> 50:04.602
He wins the PBR
two years later.

50:04.635 --> 50:07.305
Oh, come on!
You know that final went
to whoever drew Meathead.

50:09.307 --> 50:12.310
I think I'd give Denny
a little more credit
than that.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.279
He's one out of three guys
who rode him that year.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.247
That was luck of the draw.

50:16.281 --> 50:20.618
Ely, it takes a lot of heart
and skill to ride a bull.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.620
All I'm saying is,
I'm just sick and tired

50:22.653 --> 50:25.423
of these bull riders
with bad attitudes
and bad habits.

50:25.456 --> 50:28.159
It's getting like
I can tell already
who's gonna get injured.

50:28.193 --> 50:31.262
-That's bullshit!
-Ely!

50:31.296 --> 50:34.132
-You don't know
who's gonna get hurt.
-Sure, I do.

50:34.165 --> 50:38.203
It's the power guys,
using the Mitchell technique,
slapping themselves around.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.705
-Just like Dad did.
-All right, Mr. Expert.

50:40.738 --> 50:43.441
What are you gonna tell
Ronnie Kitchens about getting
his face rearranged?

50:43.474 --> 50:45.276
That was the bull.

50:45.310 --> 50:46.777
Fine. Then what are you gonna
tell me?

50:50.615 --> 50:52.383
If you don't smarten up
and start listening,

50:52.417 --> 50:54.752
you're gonna get hurt again,
real bad.

50:54.785 --> 50:57.355
You know what?
I've had it
with all your talking.

50:57.388 --> 51:01.192
My brother loves to go on
and on about this and that,
all day long.

51:01.226 --> 51:04.095
Who made you the expert
anyway, huh?

51:04.129 --> 51:08.166
Besides, Dad got
two money titles.
When did you win anything?

51:08.199 --> 51:10.235
-That's enough!
-You bet it is.

51:15.206 --> 51:18.576
Whatever point you are trying
to make, you just ruined
that dinner!

51:18.609 --> 51:20.645
I didn't ruin that dinner.
Hank did.

51:20.678 --> 51:22.447
And if nobody can see that,
then forget it!

51:23.648 --> 51:25.516
Get back here. Come here.

51:25.550 --> 51:29.120
-This isn't like you.
-Yeah? Maybe it is.

51:29.154 --> 51:31.422
Maybe I'm finally taking up
my place in the world

51:31.456 --> 51:33.358
instead of wandering around
like a goddamn ghost.

51:33.391 --> 51:35.092
Get in here! Come on back!

51:43.334 --> 51:45.436
Eddie, you know he won
all the big ones, right?

51:45.470 --> 51:48.839
-Sure did.
-Cheyenne, Calgary, Denver.

51:48.873 --> 51:52.477
All of them except the finals.
Placed high, but he never
won it.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.412
-Who, your pops?
-Yeah.

51:54.445 --> 51:58.416
It's like Jim Kelly,
Dan Marino. Something's always
gonna be missing.

51:58.449 --> 52:01.919
Hell. Finals back then was
just another rodeo.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.722
PBR was just a pipe dream.

52:04.755 --> 52:07.858
I don't think your daddy
or the rest of us gave
a second goddamn thought.

52:07.892 --> 52:10.428
Yeah, well, hell,
everything's different now.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.764
Everything. Just look at
the old films.

52:13.798 --> 52:16.467
The bulls were pussies
compared to the bulls
we ride now.

52:16.501 --> 52:18.669
These bulls we ride,
they're killers.

52:18.703 --> 52:21.406
-They're killers!
-Looks pretty much
the same to me.

52:21.439 --> 52:23.441
-You don't know shit.
-Come on!

52:23.474 --> 52:25.843
Break it up, goddamn it!
Come on!

52:25.876 --> 52:27.912
Oh, shit.
What the hell happened?

52:27.945 --> 52:29.547
I didn't touch him!

52:47.698 --> 52:51.202
DOCTOR: We have to find out.
It could be a number
of things.

52:51.236 --> 52:53.804
An injury in the past years.

52:53.838 --> 52:56.974
It could be a hemorrhage
from the hits he took
over the past months.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.644
Or maybe from the one tonight.

53:01.946 --> 53:05.883
-I didn't realize
it was that serious.
-Hard to tell.

53:05.916 --> 53:10.421
-I still think he should
stay overnight.
-I sort of have already.

53:10.455 --> 53:12.657
At least come back tomorrow
for more blood work

53:12.690 --> 53:14.392
and X ray follow-up.

53:14.425 --> 53:15.226
Okay.

53:16.427 --> 53:18.463
Prednisone. Take with food.

53:23.768 --> 53:25.436
And no more bulls, young man.

53:29.740 --> 53:31.442
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Night.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.615
Your shirt's all screwed up.

53:44.021 --> 53:46.291
You know when
I'm talking and stuff?

53:47.425 --> 53:49.727
I'm not talking about you.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.962
That conversation about you,

53:51.996 --> 53:54.432
that's a whole other deal.

53:54.465 --> 53:56.267
Don't make me have it
with you now.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.870
-Come back tomorrow?
-Yeah.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.872
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.641
Let's get outta here.

54:14.319 --> 54:16.354
Hey. I'll give you
a ride down.

54:16.387 --> 54:17.422
No, I'm all right. Thanks.

54:19.424 --> 54:20.858
What do you mean?
You don't want the company?

54:22.427 --> 54:23.828
Not unless you're going
to Salt Lake.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.598
Salt Lake City?

54:27.632 --> 54:30.468
-You're going
to Salt Lake City rodeo?
-Yeah.

54:30.501 --> 54:32.770
Jesus Christ, Ely!
Didn't you listen to what
the doctor said?

54:32.803 --> 54:35.573
I feel fine. Whatever they
gave me, it worked.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.274
-Don't do that!
-You listen to me!

54:40.578 --> 54:44.415
If you go now, in the shape
you're in, you are going to be
killing yourself.

54:44.449 --> 54:47.318
And if I do, it'll be me
doing it, okay?

54:47.352 --> 54:50.388
Not you, not Mom, Connie.

54:50.421 --> 54:51.322
Me.

54:54.058 --> 54:56.661
Christ, I can't do
this anymore.

54:56.694 --> 54:58.429
This is your deal, not mine.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.474
You know,

55:13.478 --> 55:17.382
maybe you can explain
to me why it always had to be
your deal or my deal,

55:18.983 --> 55:21.352
why it never could just
be ours.

55:25.423 --> 55:26.757
I don't know.

56:13.471 --> 56:16.541
Back office says
we need to take
a wait-and-see attitude.

56:16.574 --> 56:18.676
Granted, you're a great story
with the comeback,

56:18.709 --> 56:21.045
but we only sponsor guys
who make the finals.

56:21.078 --> 56:23.814
-I'm going to the finals!
-I know that.

56:23.848 --> 56:27.485
It's a formality.
Just a few spots up
in the rankings is all.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.487
-We're rooting for you.
-Yeah, right.

56:31.689 --> 56:33.524
I'll see you around.

56:43.133 --> 56:47.438
Check it out, son.
It don't get better than this.

57:08.493 --> 57:09.994
Hey, comeback kid!

57:10.895 --> 57:12.129
Come here.

57:13.197 --> 57:14.965
Give me a hand, cowboy.

57:18.503 --> 57:22.172
Whoa! Easy, cowboy.
There's a foot in there.

57:26.944 --> 57:30.881
-Like them?
-They're nice.

57:30.915 --> 57:34.552
Why don't you talk to the rep?
You're high up, aren't you?

57:34.585 --> 57:36.721
-Top five.
-That's what I thought.

57:39.657 --> 57:41.726
What does someone like you do
when there's no one around?

57:44.028 --> 57:45.095
I find someone.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.498
Right.

57:50.267 --> 57:53.938
Out of the five dates
you've had with my brother,
you came through on only one.

57:56.273 --> 57:57.642
Is that true?

57:59.143 --> 58:01.646
Jesus, I have no life.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.480
It's true!

58:05.282 --> 58:08.886
What's with the score keeping?
You got a notebook somewhere?

58:08.919 --> 58:10.988
If you saw what it does
to him, you wouldn't need
a notebook.

58:14.058 --> 58:17.595
You're making me feel bad.
Your brother's a good man.

58:17.628 --> 58:18.696
You bet.

58:20.931 --> 58:22.767
You want a drink?

58:22.800 --> 58:24.201
I'll see you around.

58:49.126 --> 58:51.762
-Hey, Doc?
-It popped.

58:51.796 --> 58:54.732
Okay, hold on.
Let him get his feet up.

58:55.933 --> 58:57.334
(YELLING)

58:57.367 --> 58:59.236
It's gonna hurt. Ready?

59:00.871 --> 59:02.306
(CRACKING)

59:02.339 --> 59:05.009
Every time you pop that out,
you're making it worse.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.011
What do you want me to do?

59:07.044 --> 59:08.846
Try landing on
your left shoulder.

59:11.015 --> 59:13.784
-This is for the pain.
-Good old Dr. Hack.

59:13.818 --> 59:17.154
No, I don't want
a prescription. I need
something now for the pain.

59:17.187 --> 59:21.225
You boys are gonna have
to learn how to ride better.
I gave them all away.

59:21.258 --> 59:23.260
Let's get outta here.

59:23.293 --> 59:25.295
You gave them to who?
I never seen you give
a pill to no one.

59:26.664 --> 59:29.033
Next!

59:29.066 --> 59:31.802
-Rooster!
-Hey, boys, what's going on?

59:34.004 --> 59:36.240
-I got something
for that pain.
-What do you got?

59:36.273 --> 59:37.808
I got some good stuff.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.710
What a nice surprise!

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.048
Excellent timing, Connie.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:19.650
Thank you.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.888
-It's been too long!
-I know.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:29.359
Listen, I came out here 'cause

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.961
I was thinking that...

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:35.199
I don't know how to say this,
but you know,

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:37.868
when you break up
with someone,

01:00:37.902 --> 01:00:40.705
it's not just the two of you,
it's everyone else too.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:46.110
And I was thinking
that maybe it doesn't have
to be that way.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:50.948
I must have picked up
that telephone 20 times
to call you.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:54.118
As far as Ely goes,
you did the right thing.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.988
Most of us just go on and on,

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:02.727
taking whatever comes,
not asking for more.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.696
But you have a right
to expect more,
'cause you deserve it.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:09.366
Thanks.

01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:15.873
Hank and his shiny new toy!

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.777
-Wow!
-What do you think?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.413
-It's gonna be a shame
to get it dirty.
-Mom tell ya?

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:27.084
-Hank's got a contract
for Bakersfield.
-Congratulations.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:31.155
Thanks. We're leaving when
I get these bulls loaded.
I'll stop on my way back.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.290
See ya.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:01:59.884
(DOOR KNOCKING)

01:02:03.487 --> 01:02:06.757
-Hey, how you doing?
-I'm good. How are you?

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:10.494
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted
to get a bite to eat.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:14.231
How sweet.
This is my sister Debbie.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.367
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Ely Braxton, ma'am.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.337
Nice to meet you, Ely Braxton.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.907
Why don't you come in
and have some ice cream
with the girls?

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.876
Come on.
Get your butt in here.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:28.512
Honey, you cannot call
that a dress!

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.915
I can so! It was a dress!

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:36.053
Last year I give her
a Victoria's Secret
gift certificate.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.788
Do you know
what she buys herself?

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:41.325
Overalls. Can you imagine?

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:46.363
Why would anyone buy
themselves work clothes
out of that catalog?

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:50.935
It's a little like buying
yourself a hot dog
in a French restaurant.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.903
Aren't you clever!

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:56.506
Our mama always thought
she would be happier as a man.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.845
That is a lie! That is a lie.
That is not true.

01:03:00.878 --> 01:03:03.513
-It is too true.
-It is not.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:07.484
-What's the matter with you?
-You're trying to pick up
this boy...

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.287
We're just having a good time.
I'm not trying to pick him up.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.123
-He knows a woman
when he sees one.
-Flashing your titties?

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:17.828
Honey, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry if I'm a real woman!

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:22.099
Why would a man go
for a hamburger
when he can get a big sirloin?

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.401
-You okay to drive home?
-Yeah.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:28.338
Ah!

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.340
What a nightmare!

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.413
I like her.

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:38.983
Oh, yeah? I bet you do.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:43.087
Celia!

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.922
I gotta use the phone
before I go!

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:46.423
No!

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.059
Why?

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:51.328
Because you're a pain
in the ass.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:53.130
Stupid, selfish little bitch!

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.332
Be good.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.902
What are
you looking at?

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:04.141
Joe, stop here.
I'm just gonna be a minute.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.919
Leave us alone!

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:30.027
Talk to him.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.113
Let's just go.
Come on, let's go.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:07.131
I thought I was pretty clear
on the phone.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:12.236
Yeah, I know, Hank,
but I already penciled you in.
I suppose I just...

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.738
I don't know.
I figured since you was here,
you'd be fighting.

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:17.641
You knew what this meant
to me.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:21.245
This was supposed to be
my first full-on deal
as a contractor.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:24.381
Hey, it's just a little more
dinero. Right?

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.650
What the hell's wrong
with that? Huh?

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.286
For Christ's sake!

01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:34.358
Fine.

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:38.162
ANNOUNCER:
This bull, Zapata,
has never been ridden.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.040
Whoo! I'd say Zapata won
that war.

01:06:57.381 --> 01:06:59.549
Hank, damn, he's bucking good!

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:03.520
You rooting for the bulls now?

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:07.124
That's Zapata!

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.592
Where you been?

01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.260
You don't want to know.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.723
(HORN BLOWS)

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:46.096
Yeah!

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:49.065
ANNOUNCER:
Eighty-eight points!
What a ride! Eighty-eight!

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:14.524
You pull a stunt like
that again and you're out
of the loop. You got it?

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.529
What the heck was that?
What the hell are you doing?

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.532
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:26.736
You do not come back
to the ranch. Understand me?
No more.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:30.307
You wanna know what kind
of a father you got?
Take a look in the mirror!

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.844
Yeah. That's what I thought.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.156
I was wondering when
you were gonna show me
that temper.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.124
Let's go load the bulls.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.259
Hi, handsome.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:35.699
I'm taking Zapata
and the other bulls down
to PBR in Vegas.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:39.836
-I figure, when in Rome...
-Great. This calls
for a celebration.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:43.340
-What do you wanna do?
-Um, pie? Louanne's?

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:45.842
Okay. Park.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.650
Wow.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:55.585
It's the frosting.
Don't you think?

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.820
Must be.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.290
You seem really good.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:03.259
I am. I'm okay. How about you?

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.629
I'm good.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:07.931
And bad.

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.533
And bad and good.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:15.305
Do you see him much?

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:17.307
Not really.

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:20.477
How is he?

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.615
I don't know. He seems okay.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.958
You know,

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:39.763
in a different world,
you and I would've made
a lot more sense.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:43.800
Yeah. In a different world.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.347
Mr. PBR!

01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:59.549
Hey, you're in!

01:11:59.583 --> 01:12:01.951
Yeah, that was close.
I got lucky, I guess.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.721
You did not get lucky.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:07.056
I'm gonna come with you.
We're gonna do something sick
in Vegas.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.393
What? You wanna get married?

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.560
Who knows?

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:13.863
Oh, get this!
Ray is looking for you.

01:12:13.897 --> 01:12:16.900
-TNN wants an interview.
-Don't do that.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.669
I'm sorry. Aren't you excited?

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:22.038
Say something! You're the man!

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:24.140
Vegas! It's yours!

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.144
-Did you get any other calls?
-You keep asking me that.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:32.048
I was hoping to hear
from Hank. We always go
to the finals together.

01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:44.060
-Take the phone. Call him.
-I don't want the phone.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.463
You are really hung up
on the past.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.933
You should just get rid
of this big brother,
little brother, father shit.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.768
It is not helping you.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:56.039
You are almost at the top now.
You don't need all this crap.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:59.809
Maybe you should deal with it.
Hank will be at the finals
with his bulls.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:00.944
Just face it.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:20.096
Ely, I would hold off
on those pills
until after the interview.

01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:24.100
So now I have to pay you
to be my manager?

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:27.604
Oh, my God!

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:29.806
What the hell is with you?

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.208
Nothing.

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:35.011
For the last few days,
you've made me feel like
I've done something wrong.

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:36.546
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.549
Then what is it?

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:46.523
Are you gonna be mad
at me for wanting you
instead of him?

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:50.860
If you are, you should
let me know.

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:53.863
I got better things to do
than follow you to Vegas
and be treated like shit.

01:14:08.712 --> 01:14:12.982
Hey, Hank! Ely's gonna be
on television any minute!

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:14.217
Come on.

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.923
Ely, it's been
an impressive year.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.158
Did you really think you'd
have a shot
at the championship?

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:25.495
It's important to take it
one bull at a time.

01:14:25.529 --> 01:14:28.632
When I came up,
your dad was the man.

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:32.902
He looked like he was
in control all the time, and
I see a little of that in you.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:35.171
That can't be helped, I guess.

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:38.207
Good genes, they'll only take
you so far.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:42.145
Did you pick up any words
of wisdom from your dad?

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:44.247
Sure, you bet. Lots of things.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.883
- Share them with us.
-This ought to be interesting.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:50.153
Not to think too much,
to stay centered,

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:53.723
get through the eight seconds
the best you can
and cowboy up.

01:14:53.757 --> 01:14:57.927
All right. Thanks, Ely.
Good luck, and give Pops
my best.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:03.232
Ely Braxton, he's
my dark horse pick for the PBR
championships in Las Vegas.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.534
I'm Donnie Gay for TNN.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:21.685
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.824
If things were reversed,
would Hank have given me
up for you?

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.194
Yeah, he would have.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.534
Take care of yourself,
all right?

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:37.687
(BELL DINGING)

01:17:53.036 --> 01:17:57.073
Again Ely Braxton
with another powerful ride.
How did it feel?

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.876
It felt great.
I'm just rocking
along as usual.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:02.746
Well, rocking along,
it was a great ride, Ely.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:05.949
Your next draw,
your brother's bull,
the bad boy, Zapata.

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.283
What do you think about him?

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:16.059
That seemed to even get
his attention, Pam.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.061
But in all honesty,
that bull is a bad one.

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:20.730
(YELLING)

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:43.987
Hey.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.459
That's something new.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:55.899
Tell me something.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:58.768
At least...

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:02.371
At least tell me all this
had to do with love.

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:11.414
You know, Ray swears
Zapata was luck of the draw.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.319
Yeah.

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:20.890
What do you think?

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.961
Me?

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.363
I thought you might have me
set up for the ass-kicking
I deserve.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.781
What's this?

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:49.853
It's Dad's address.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.126
It's not far from here.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:07.937
You got your work
cut out for you.

01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:18.982
Hey, Hank.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.165
I could really use your help
with this one.

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:47.510
Ely, you gotta lighten
your load.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.983
All that shit you've been
hanging on to for,
Jesus Christ,

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:56.953
God only knows how long.

01:20:58.054 --> 01:20:59.455
You gotta let it go.

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.327
If you wanna ride Zapata,

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:07.931
you've gotta drop everything
and everyone

01:21:10.133 --> 01:21:11.467
that isn't you.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.339
Then you'll be fine.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.677
We both know
you can ride anything.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.612
You'll be fine.

01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:24.647
Hey.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:28.884
I'm sorry.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:37.893
That's a start.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:42.431
You be careful.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:45.001
And I love you.

ANNOUNCER:
It don't get better than this.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.264
What the hell?

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:26.435
-What time is it?
-It's late.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:30.039
You guys got the shits
of a life.

01:23:30.073 --> 01:23:32.241
Least ways, you didn't bring
no camera with you this year.

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.112
What the hell?

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:38.547
Suppose you better come on in.
Come on.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.752
Same thing every year.

01:23:43.786 --> 01:23:48.324
I know when it's finals time,
when you reporters start
coming round.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.659
-I'm not a reporter.
-What the hell are you then?

01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:56.132
-I'm a bull rider.
-Oh! A cowboy, huh?

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:59.368
I used to ride bulls,
real ones.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:04.807
Not this corn-fed,
feedlot pussies you see
nowadays.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.210
Come on, sit yourself down.
Have a seat.

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:09.745
Go on through.

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:15.151
Get kids like you
in here asking for advice.

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:18.487
I don't got much to tell them
except you gotta fight
that damn bull

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:21.490
like he's just crawled out
of your sweetheart's bed.

01:24:21.524 --> 01:24:25.528
You gotta hate that sucker,
and then you gotta hate him
some more.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:28.731
It's a goddamn war,
is what it is.

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:31.700
And you're a damn fool
if you think it's otherwise.

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:34.603
Let me show you
this here thing.
Now, where is that...

01:24:34.637 --> 01:24:38.141
Where is that thing I put...
There it is.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:40.343
Wait a minute now.
Look at this.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:47.183
That's Wyoming, 1969.
I won that.

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:50.286
I was out the night before
with the boys, tomcatting.

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:53.556
That's a hell of a town
for that.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:56.492
We left that bar,
went straight to the rodeo.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:59.428
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:02.465
And damn me if I didn't win
that damned thing.

01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:05.368
You just sit right here.
Wait one minute.

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:08.103
I got something, I just put
my hands to it here.

01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:12.575
Where the hell did I put
those sons of bitches?

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.211
There they are.

01:25:15.244 --> 01:25:18.814
Well, almost out of them.

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:21.317
I got one left.
You can have it.

01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:23.486
There you are, son.
What do you think of that?

01:25:26.389 --> 01:25:30.359
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Let me have that.

01:25:30.393 --> 01:25:32.561
What did you say
your name was, cowboy?

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:35.130
Ely.

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.633

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.239
Ely what?

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.276
Just Ely.

01:25:47.943 --> 01:25:49.545
Just plain old Ely?

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:52.715
There you go.

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:57.486
"From Reid Braxton
to just old Ely."

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.589
Now, son, you take care
of that. That's gonna be worth
a lot of money someday.

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:05.194
Want another beer?
I'll get you another beer.

01:26:05.228 --> 01:26:07.363
Yep, one more beer coming up.

01:26:25.314 --> 01:26:26.215

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.353
Wow, you're there.

01:26:33.356 --> 01:26:34.957
-Ely?
- Afraid so.

-Where are you?
- Somewhere near Vegas.

01:26:41.264 --> 01:26:42.431
Been up all night?

Is there still a chance
for the two of us?

You're the one
that's gambling.

Forty-five world-class

started this competition
last Thursday

01:27:46.329 --> 01:27:48.397
and after three go-arounds,

01:27:48.431 --> 01:27:53.035

for tonight's finals!

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:55.771

with over half a million
dollars worth of prize money
tonight

01:28:39.682 --> 01:28:43.652
if they make it through
the eight seconds safe
and sound.

01:28:43.686 --> 01:28:46.622
But it won't be that easy,
as you know.

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:49.124
Because each and every one
of our heroes

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.595
will ride the rankest,

01:28:52.628 --> 01:28:56.932
the meanest bulls known
to mankind!

01:28:56.965 --> 01:29:00.903

in your prayers!

PAM: (ON TV) Welcome back
to the PBR Finals,
live from Las Vegas.

01:29:15.418 --> 01:29:18.821
Donnie, the action
has been exciting.
Do you have any predictions?

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:22.591
DONNIE: Well, Eric Black's
been on a run since Cheyenne.

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:24.693
And you know
what momentum means when
you come to the PBR Finals.

01:29:24.727 --> 01:29:26.895
Best bulls, best bull riders.

01:29:26.929 --> 01:29:29.432
But you gotta take
the injuries into account.

01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:33.669
Like Weathers and Franks,
they're hurting.
You gotta look to Ely Braxton.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.839
PAM: He's gotten by one bull
but what about this draw
in the next round?

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:39.041
DONNIE: It's the classic
good news/bad news story.

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:41.944
He knows the bull because
he belongs to his brother.
The bad news,

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:45.814
the bull's Zapata. Unridden,
and maybe the most dangerous
animal on earth.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:48.617
PAM: He's got his hands
full, but what makes that bull
so tough?

01:29:48.651 --> 01:29:50.986
DONNIE: Pam, he's got
a lot of moves,

01:29:51.019 --> 01:29:54.657
but in reality, he's just
so dangerous, it makes
it real hard to concentrate.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:56.625
PAM: As we wait for that ride,
let's move
to chute number three.

to bring him back.

01:37:46.428 --> 01:37:47.362
It's okay.

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:58.673
Come on.
I'll take care of this, okay?

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.608
Come on, put it down.

01:38:00.642 --> 01:38:02.577
Come on, it's okay.

01:38:07.449 --> 01:38:08.917
(SOBBING)

01:38:35.077 --> 01:38:37.079
All right, Joe, come on.
Let's go.

01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:28.696
You sure you wanna do this?

01:39:28.730 --> 01:39:30.298
Yeah. Let him out.

01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:30.292
That's what he would've done.

01:40:31.426 --> 01:40:32.660
Yeah.

01:40:36.731 --> 01:40:38.100
Come on.
