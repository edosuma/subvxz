WEBVTT

00:20.353 --> 00:21.312
This is delicious.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.150
You wouldn't even know
it's not meat, right?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.276
-Wrong.
-Char.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.778
-This isn't meat?
-Nope. I can't eat this.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.071
Okay. You know what?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.907
You are being a jerk. We have a guest.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.201
Is she a guest or does she live here now?

00:35.285 --> 00:37.078
Yeah. How long is Judy staying with us?

00:37.370 --> 00:40.040
Um... Well, I don't know. It's the...

00:40.290 --> 00:43.209
-first night, so...
-I mean, we haven't talked about it.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.046
-No. We've never discussed the exact...
-I don't know. Is it like...

00:46.129 --> 00:48.590
-...time frame, but...
-I don't wanna be awkward about it.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.592
No. Let's not be awkward, it's--

00:50.884 --> 00:53.053
-Whatever you...
-Whatever you need.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.138
-As long as you want it.
-As long as you want it.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.641
-Sounds good.
-Okay?

00:58.725 --> 01:00.185
You don't even know her.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.645
You met her in some group a few weeks ago.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.106
And now she's gonna live in Dad's studio.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.400
-Do you know how fucked up that is?
-Okay.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.988
She is sitting right here,
so you're being rude, A.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.824
B, enough with the "fucks," okay?

01:14.908 --> 01:19.287
You're 14 years old. And C, I would never,
ever put you in harm's way.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.248
Okay? Everything is gonna be fine.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.125
I'm an excellent judge of character.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.671
Except for that one babysitter
that stole money from your evening bag.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.381
Stephanie.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.549
Yeah, Stephanie.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.887
Okay. You know, well, Judy is not
a petty thief with an opioid addiction.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.807
-That I know of.
-No, I'm not.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.184
But I hope that Stephanie
got the help that she needs.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.393
She's dead.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.562
Um...

01:45.105 --> 01:48.775
Charlie, I totally get it
that it's weird that I'm here.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.527
Look, you could be anybody.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.694
I could be anybody.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
She could be a crazy person.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.239
So could I.

01:54.906 --> 01:55.907
So could I.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.331
[ominous music playing]

02:08.044 --> 02:09.420
I'm really sorry about Charlie.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.090
He's just... God, he's been such
a little dick since his dad died.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.801
-Oh, he's great.
-If you think he's great,

02:14.884 --> 02:16.761
-then you are a saint.
-[chuckles]

02:16.886 --> 02:19.139
-Oh, he's great.
-No, I'm not a saint.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.558
-You are an angel.
-Oh, please. No.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.227
-You'll come to find that I am the devil.
-I'm the devil.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.563
I'm glad you're here.

02:28.022 --> 02:28.898
Me, too.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.235
Oh, you know what?

02:32.318 --> 02:35.029
There's some fresh linens
and towels over there for you.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.490
I... I'm sorry, I didn't make up the bed.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.535
I just haven't been able to bring myself
to go into the guesthouse since--

02:40.618 --> 02:44.372
Oh, stop it. Come on. You are so nice.
I can't thank you enough.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.249
-You're such a good friend.
-Oh!

02:46.875 --> 02:48.209
[clears throat] Well...

02:49.794 --> 02:50.712
not that good.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.630
[scoffs] What?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.926
Look, this... wasn't my finest moment.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.344
But...

02:59.846 --> 03:03.808
I gave Steve my business card
the night I found out he wasn't dead.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.351
-Oh.
-And...

03:05.435 --> 03:06.352
he called me,

03:07.103 --> 03:09.397
and I'm selling his house.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.317
-Okay.
-I'm really sorry.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.154
But to be fair, in the moment,
I thought you were a lying psychopath.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.573
-No, of course.
-Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.782
-What?
-You're bleeding.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.950
Oh, God.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.203
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah. It's a nick.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.705
-The glass chipped. Sorry.
-Okay.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.248
Look, I just...

03:27.332 --> 03:30.376
I just hope it's not gonna be weird,
me working with Steve.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.545
Hmm... It's a little weird.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.048
I mean, not as weird as you
lying about him being dead, but...

03:35.131 --> 03:36.466
No. Right, not that weird.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.259
-That was way weird.
-Yeah.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.095
-Can I please get you a Band-Aid?
-No, I'm...

03:41.179 --> 03:43.348
Because it looks like a gash,
not really a nick.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.390
I'm a bleeder.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.644
Everyone's a bleeder,
but that's just real... grim.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.480
I just... I don't know.
I guess maybe I thought that, like,

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
I don't know, if Steve and I
would work it out or something.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.569
[sighs heavily]

03:56.778 --> 04:00.406
-Do you still have feelings for him?
-No. I shouldn't.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.993
You know what?
This is probably for the best, you know?

04:04.077 --> 04:08.039
-It's gonna force you to just move on.
-Yeah.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.750
But I just... That was our house.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.212
We were gonna have a family there.
And he doesn't even run it past me?

04:14.379 --> 04:17.215
Well, you know what?
You can stay here as long as you want.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.299
-Oh, stop.
-Okay?

04:18.675 --> 04:19.550
Oh!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.928
Yeah. You know, I'm gonna get

04:22.428 --> 04:25.348
the first aid kit,
'cause this looks like a horror movie.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.349
Thank you.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.354
[exhales]

05:21.362 --> 05:23.364
[breathing rapidly]

05:28.703 --> 05:30.413
Oh, Jesus...

05:41.716 --> 05:43.092
[sighing]

06:05.782 --> 06:07.158
-[screams]
-[tires screech]

06:08.076 --> 06:09.285
[panting] Oh, my God.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.635
[ringing tone]

06:46.572 --> 06:48.157
Hey! Slow down!

06:49.158 --> 06:51.077
2QCE 265.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.454
-2QCE 265.
-[tires screech]

06:53.621 --> 06:55.873
[repeats number under her breath]

06:56.666 --> 06:58.292
2QCE 265.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.963
Hi, Gina. Is Steve around?

07:02.046 --> 07:02.880
-Judy.
-Hi.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.341
Haven't seen you in a while.
Steve's actually not in.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.760
-Oh. Mind if I just check?
-Actually, I'm not supposed to...

07:08.469 --> 07:11.097
-Judy. Hey, girl. Can I help...
-Hey, girl.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.521
Sorry, girl,
but you really can't be in here.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.148
Girl, I know!

07:21.899 --> 07:22.900
Bye, girl.

07:24.110 --> 07:24.944
Bye.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.322
Uh-huh. 2QCE 265.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.950
He was speeding near the street
that Ted was hit,

07:31.033 --> 07:33.244
so I just thought maybe
there'd be a connection there.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.246
Oh, that's a stretch?

07:35.705 --> 07:39.083
Well, maybe if you found the guy,
I wouldn't have to fucking stretch!

07:39.167 --> 07:40.835
-Who we yelling at now?
-Cops.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.004
-Wonderful. Steve is here.
-[sighs]

07:45.047 --> 07:47.133
-Hey-o.
-Hey! There he is!

07:47.216 --> 07:49.552
[chuckles] Christopher was just giving me
a tour of your office.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.430
Nice! Love it.
It's, like,Â beachy but not tacky.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.557
You know, it's a tough wave to surf.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.100
Thank you. Have a seat.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.978
I can't wait to take a tour of <i>your </i>house.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.105
I drove past it last week.

08:01.355 --> 08:04.942
Goosebumps from stem to stern.
Oh, here's the exclusivity agreement.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.778
Yeah, thanks. No, it's a sweet place,
definitely, but...

08:08.446 --> 08:10.031
way too much room for me now.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.574
-Right, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.911
Oh, hey, how's Judy? Did you find her
that night you came looking for her?

08:15.286 --> 08:16.245
I did.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.664
Yes. Actually, um...

08:19.457 --> 08:22.376
It was just a really
funny misunderstanding, but...

08:22.668 --> 08:23.503
meant to be.

08:23.961 --> 08:24.795
How so?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.798
Well, I met you.
And now we are working together.

08:29.008 --> 08:32.261
You have been hanging out with Judy.
Sounds like something she would say.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.096
Judy's actually living with Jen now.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.557
-Is she?
-[Jen] Mm-hmm.

08:36.641 --> 08:37.892
Yeah, in my guesthouse.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.519
It's, uh, really...

08:39.602 --> 08:42.313
It's nice having another adult around
after my husband died, so...

08:43.272 --> 08:46.817
She needed a place to land.
And it just worked out for both of us.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.236
Great. It's very kind of you.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.612
You know, Judy's...

08:49.695 --> 08:50.863
She's been through a lot.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.031
I know. I know.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.700
She's really... She's been a rock for me.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.035
[chuckles]

08:58.246 --> 08:59.080
Really?

08:59.872 --> 09:00.706
Yeah.

09:01.082 --> 09:01.999
Why?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.752
Uh, look, I don't want to talk badly
about her, but...

09:04.835 --> 09:09.131
uh, for whatever it's worth,
let's just say wherever Judy goes,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.633
chaos tends to follow.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.886
-Okay.
-No, really. I wish her the best.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.514
But, uh, she is, um...

09:19.225 --> 09:21.102
a little nuts. [laughs]

09:21.435 --> 09:24.188
[laughs nervously]
Well, that feels like new information.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.694
[sitar music playing]

09:46.586 --> 09:49.088
What in the holy fuck?

09:52.341 --> 09:53.509
You are free.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
[sighs] Oh, God.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.309
[clapping hands]

10:01.976 --> 10:02.893
Oh, boy.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.739
[engine roars]

10:14.989 --> 10:16.198
-[tires screech]
-Motherfucker!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.326
[grunts]

10:21.621 --> 10:23.122
-[tires screech]
-[Jen laughs]

10:25.958 --> 10:26.792
[Jen] Hey!

10:26.876 --> 10:28.419
[man] You threw a rock at my car,
crazy bitch?

10:28.502 --> 10:30.504
You could've hit someone, asshole.
Slow the fuck down.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.672
Yeah? Make me. [spits]

10:31.756 --> 10:33.215
Ew! Fuck you!

10:39.639 --> 10:43.768
Yes, it was the same asshole,
still speeding, and the fucker spit at me.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.022
Mm-hmm.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.276
Yes, that is the exact message
I want you to give the detective.

10:52.693 --> 10:53.527
Thank you.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.369
[Judy snoring]

11:09.627 --> 11:10.461
[Jen] Hey.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.879
Hi.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.632
Breakfast is almost ready.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.593
Um, have you been sleeping outside?

11:18.886 --> 11:19.929
Oh, yeah.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.806
Okay.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.057
Um...

11:23.349 --> 11:25.559
I mean, is the guesthouse not...
Are you....

11:26.143 --> 11:27.061
not...

11:27.645 --> 11:29.480
-Why?
-The guesthouse is great.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.482
-Okay.
-It's just, it's...

11:33.442 --> 11:34.777
Honestly, it's hard.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.196
Okay.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.031
There's a lot of Ted in there.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.951
Like, a lot of his stuff, and I just...

11:43.411 --> 11:44.620
It's, like, I don't know.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.872
It's kinda, like,
spiritually overwhelming.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.499
Oh.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.335
But it's okay.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.590
Well, it doesn't... You're clearly upset,
so it doesn't seem okay.

11:56.757 --> 11:57.925
I'm sorry.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.428
No, no, please. I'm... I'm sorry.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.887
No, I'm so sorry.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.099
And honestly, there's, like,
a lot of valuable stuff in there.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.393
So, I mean, maybe the kids want it or...

12:07.476 --> 12:09.687
you could even sell some of it
and make some money.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.398
I can't even bring myself to go in there.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.775
You think I'm ready
to start selling his stuff?

12:14.859 --> 12:16.152
Oh, God, you're right. I'm sorry.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.153
-I didn't...
-Oh, no.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.238
I swear I didn't mean for you
to get rid of anything.

12:19.321 --> 12:22.199
I can never get rid of anything.
I mean, I'm such a collector.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.367
I totally am. I get it.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.494
I even keep some of my stuff
in a storage facility.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.412
[doorbell chimes]

12:27.204 --> 12:29.540
-Okay. Just... one sec.
-Wait, you know what?

12:29.623 --> 12:30.916
Forget I even said that.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.587
[whispers] Shit!

12:36.338 --> 12:37.173
Ugh.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.425
-Hi.
-Ma'am.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.094
So, did you find the guy?
The license plate I called in?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.763
That fucking aggro piece of shit?

12:44.346 --> 12:45.848
-That's not...
-I don't know.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.349
We're looking for Judy Hale.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.310
[heartbeat pounding]

12:49.393 --> 12:51.645
Oh. Why are you looking for Judy?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.151
-I'm Judy.
-Ma'am, we're here to inform you

12:57.234 --> 12:59.779
that a temporary restraining order
has been placed on you,

12:59.862 --> 13:02.281
barring you
within 100 feet of Steven Wood.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.909
If we receive a complaint or notice

13:04.992 --> 13:07.953
that you have violated the terms
of this order, you will be arrested.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.455
Do you understand?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.123
I understand.

13:11.707 --> 13:12.666
Have a good day.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.087
-[Judy] I can see how this looks.
-So, what, are you...

13:17.630 --> 13:18.714
Are you stalking him?

13:19.006 --> 13:19.840
No.

13:20.090 --> 13:20.966
Not really.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.719
So, what is it?
Just, like, a light stalking?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.055
I called him a bunch of times,
and he didn't answer,

13:26.138 --> 13:27.473
so I showed up at his office.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.517
-So you went to his office?
-And his house.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.812
-And then the golf course.
-Judy...

13:32.895 --> 13:36.273
I swear, this is more a reflection
of his character than it is of mine.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.025
I have two kids
who've been through a lot.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.736
I don't need cops showing up at my door.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.988
I just wanted to talk to him
about selling the house,

13:43.364 --> 13:46.242
But he'd rather call up his cop friends
and file a restraining order

13:46.367 --> 13:47.993
to keep me from telling him
how hurt I am.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.245
Hmm.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.455
I'm just hurt.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.748
Mm-hmm.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.419
[sighs]

13:57.962 --> 13:59.588
Bet you didn't know
she was a stalker, huh?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.674
I did, actually, so...

14:05.678 --> 14:06.512
Fuck.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.265
-I told you that Steven was an asshole.
-[scoffs] I know.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.725
Why'd you even wanna talk to that putz?

14:12.059 --> 14:15.312
-There's a lot of things left unsaid.
-Let him go.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.190
-Good riddance.
-I know. I can't.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.025
Maybe I <i>am </i>crazy.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.778
You <i>are </i>crazy. But who isn't?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.655
You know what you oughta do?

14:24.738 --> 14:27.408
You oughta fill out
one of these online profiles.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.244
Or help me. I don't know what I'm doing.

14:31.078 --> 14:31.912
All right.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.581
Let's see.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.294
Abe, you know,
you don't need to do online dating.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.296
Half the women in here
are dying to get with you.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.673
[Judy] Let's see how you did.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.800
Yup, you're alive.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.636
Oh, you don't hear that
too often around here.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.223
You know, if I saw you in here, I'd click.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.392
I'm not good enough for you.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.979
Forty years ago, maybe, but...

14:57.813 --> 14:59.148
I'm not so picky now.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.692
-I'm serious.
-Hmm?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.194
I've done some really bad things, Abe.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.405
Aww, who among us?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.532
We all mess up.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.035
But I know you.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.245
You're good.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.539
Crazy or not.

15:15.998 --> 15:16.874
I love you.

15:16.957 --> 15:17.958
Aww.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.759
Welcome to my humble abode.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.054
-[Christopher gasps]
-Told you I'd make it up to you.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.388
You did good.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.182
Steve, can I be honest?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.601
-No, lie to me.
-Hilarious.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.144
This place is stunning, bro.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.605
-Oh, thanks, man.
-No, it's perfect.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
It-- It'll sell so fast.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.109
I mean, these interiors!
Are you sure you're not gay?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.819
[chuckles] That I know of.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.989
No, I'm sure. Water? Cold, room temp?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.533
Oh, I'm so good.
Can I keep giving myself a tour?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.285
Yeah, man. Knock yourself out, bro.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.955
-Here we are.
-Oh, thanks.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.040
-Figured you were a room temp girl.
-You got me.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.875
-Perfect.
-It really is stunning.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.168
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.672
It's weird, though. I wouldÂ never know
Judy ever lived here.

16:04.922 --> 16:05.839
Hm.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.343
Yeah, I just always had a pretty clear
vision of the space, I guess.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.511
She just let me run with it.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.346
You know, I, um...

16:12.429 --> 16:15.265
I don't wanna get
in the middle of anything, but...

16:15.849 --> 16:17.393
a restraining order?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.354
I mean, how concerned should I be?

16:21.146 --> 16:22.398
Uh... [chuckles]

16:22.481 --> 16:24.608
I'm sorry if that whole thing
caused any drama,

16:24.692 --> 16:28.195
but, um, I felt like I needed
to send a message.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.280
You know, she won't leave me alone.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.740
-[Jen murmurs]
-Um...

16:32.491 --> 16:34.326
I just wanna move on. That's all.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.203
Right.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.247
[Christopher] I'm gonna--
Can I go upstairs?

16:38.622 --> 16:41.333
-Mm. Mi casa is your casa. Please.
-Going up, too?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.793
-Of course.
-Great.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.461
[Christopher laughs in delight]

16:44.795 --> 16:46.130
Ooh! What's in here?

16:46.213 --> 16:48.132
Oh, you know, actually...
Maybe you don't...

16:48.465 --> 16:50.259
Okay. Well, this needs a little work.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.428
[Steven] Oh, I'm sorry about this.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.637
[Jen] Oh.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.015
Uh, it's okay.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.601
Well, you know, I honestly kind of...
forget about this room.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.729
I usually just keep the doors shut and...

17:02.896 --> 17:05.774
-I can't really bring myself to--
-It's... I get it.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.570
Judy told me about the miscarriages.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.572
She did?

17:11.822 --> 17:12.906
Yeah. She did.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.409
[sighs] It's terrible.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.829
Can't tell you how many times
we started decorating this room.

17:18.996 --> 17:19.830
I can imagine.

17:21.081 --> 17:24.710
We waited, too. You know, this last time,
we thought we were in the clear.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.504
I mean, she was five months.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.673
Um...

17:33.260 --> 17:34.511
Should've waited longer.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.724
You know, babies don't even need
their own room...

17:41.518 --> 17:45.773
Look, I guess I don't know
either of you very well, but...

17:46.940 --> 17:51.111
for what's it's worth, if I had gone
through what you and Judy went through,

17:51.195 --> 17:53.280
I'd... be a little nuts too.

17:58.160 --> 17:58.994
Yeah.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.622
I'm gonna show you the master suite.
It's sick.

18:02.081 --> 18:02.998
Okay.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.686
[creatures roaring]

18:26.730 --> 18:28.398
Hey, Charlie. What's up?

18:31.902 --> 18:32.945
What are you doing?

18:35.114 --> 18:35.989
Oh!

18:36.573 --> 18:37.616
Cool.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.661
That game looks... so violent.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.456
It's, like, disturbing, huh?

18:44.998 --> 18:46.625
I don't talk to strangers.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.418
Yeah, me neither.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.170
Or stalkers.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.839
No, that's smart.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.050
But just so you know,
I'm not really a stalker.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.511
I mean, not a good one, anyway.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.721
Yeah. You got caught.

18:59.847 --> 19:00.806
This time.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.227
Honestly, the whole thing
is a misunderstanding.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.648
And you expect me to believe that?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.110
Well, you're playing a game where
the women have watermelon boobs,

19:13.193 --> 19:17.239
but can somehow run 80 miles an hour,
so, I don't know what you believe.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.366
I believe you're annoying me.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.869
I just wanted to say that, um...

19:23.078 --> 19:26.331
I really appreciate you guys
letting me stay in your dad's studio.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.170
Um, well, it wasn't my call.
My vote doesn't count.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.172
It counts to me.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.509
Whatever. It's...

19:39.303 --> 19:41.305
It's just weird you being in there.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.224
It's weird for me, too.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.023
Do you have any weed?

19:51.690 --> 19:52.566
Do you?

19:53.650 --> 19:54.484
No.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.195
Good.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.866
Uh... You didn't answer.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.369
I don't talk to strangers.

20:06.830 --> 20:11.084
But I am gonna order a pizza
if you are at all interested.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.589
Only if it has meat on it.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.758
It shall.

20:25.057 --> 20:25.933
[Judy] How is it?

20:26.016 --> 20:27.434
-[Henry] Good.
-[Judy] Good? Meaty?

20:27.517 --> 20:29.770
Seriously, they killed a whole herd
of animals

20:29.853 --> 20:31.688
for you to have that much meat
on your pizza.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.941
-[Henry] Okay.
-They taste pretty good.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.568
-[Judy] Want some of my meat?
-[Henry] Sure.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.737
[Judy] There's meat on yours.
You can have all my meat.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.947
[Henry] Okay. I like it.

22:30.849 --> 22:31.767
[scoffs]

22:32.476 --> 22:33.977
No wonder you couldn't sleep.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.521
There's just so much shit in here.
[sniffles]

22:48.325 --> 22:50.327
[sighs] Let's clear it all, okay?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.079
-Really?
-Yeah.

22:52.871 --> 22:53.747
You go ahead.

22:55.582 --> 22:56.666
-Go ahead.
-No, go, please.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.460
-You first.
-I'm not gonna fight with you about this.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.378
Okay.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.506
[sighs wearily]

23:07.260 --> 23:08.887
[Henry] Can I have Dad's Les Paul?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.182
All right, kiddo. There you go.

23:13.058 --> 23:13.934
-Thanks, Mom.
-Yeah.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.478
Cool!

23:19.064 --> 23:20.816
-I want the gun.
-Hmm?

23:21.149 --> 23:22.567
-What gun?
-Dad's gun.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.362
Okay. Well, it is in the safe,
and I do not have the combination.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.615
And even if I did have the combination,
I would be getting rid of the gun.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.617
Why do you want Daddy's gun?

23:31.076 --> 23:34.204
For protection, you know?
I'm the man of the house now.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.747
Oh, come on, please.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.291
I don't know where you're getting
this patriarchal shit from,

23:38.375 --> 23:40.836
but you are not the man of the house,
you are a child.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.797
I am the woman of the house
and I do the protecting.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.173
So...

23:45.882 --> 23:47.008
You can have the drums.

23:47.092 --> 23:47.968
Yes!

23:53.682 --> 23:55.851
-Did I just get played?
-I'm pretty sure you did.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.895
Wait. I'm sorry. There's a gun in here?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.105
Mm-hmm.

24:00.814 --> 24:01.648
[Jen] Sorry.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.987
Shit, this is heavy.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.157
It's so heavy!

24:10.365 --> 24:12.409
Why didn't we hire guys to do this for us?

24:12.742 --> 24:15.287
Because we're empowered women.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.539
And I might have told you
it would be cathartic for you.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.249
Yeah. Well, it's not.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.375
Well, now we know.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.670
And, you know, hiring men to do our
bidding is also very empowering, so...

24:24.254 --> 24:26.298
Yes. Uh, note taken.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.261
I appreciate you making room for me.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.805
Yeah. I appreciate you telling me
about the storage place.

24:35.849 --> 24:39.603
You know, I saw the nursery
at Steve's house the other day.

24:41.146 --> 24:41.980
Your house.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.356
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.943
He, uh... He couldn't bear
to go in there either.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.029
He couldn't even look
when I opened the door.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.949
Well, I told you Steve's notÂ really good
at dealing with feelings.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.035
I mean, I honestlyÂ can't blame him.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.119
You know?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.873
Grief does some weird shit to people.

24:59.956 --> 25:00.790
You know?

25:02.167 --> 25:05.337
What you guys went through was...
was intense.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.380
Yeah.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.300
It was.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.347
-[screams]
-[tires screech]

25:15.430 --> 25:16.890
[panting]

25:17.682 --> 25:18.600
Holy shit.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.484
[Judy sighs]

25:29.361 --> 25:31.571
[heartbeat pounding]

25:41.039 --> 25:42.082
[sighs deeply]

25:42.207 --> 25:43.291
Are you all right?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.168
Oh, yeah.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.003
Mm-hmm.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.131
Hey, you know what?

25:52.759 --> 25:53.718
This is for you.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.265
[Jen] I just thought you might
want it back.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.851
Oh, my God!

26:03.562 --> 26:04.604
Thank you.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.732
Wow. [chuckles]

26:08.525 --> 26:10.402
-Did you steal it?
-No.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.362
No, Steve said I could have it.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.864
I mean, I would've stolen it
if I had to, you know.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.992
That's so sweet.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.537
You know,

26:21.121 --> 26:24.624
there was something that Steve
said that really, really bothered me.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.169
What?

26:28.837 --> 26:30.130
He said you were nuts.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.423
Oh, yeah.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.134
It was practically my nickname.

26:34.217 --> 26:35.552
No, but that's not okay.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.888
Men call women nuts and crazy
way too often

26:38.972 --> 26:40.390
just to undermine us.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.267
You know?

26:42.350 --> 26:43.268
Yeah. You're right.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.438
No, you shouldn't.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.399
No, crazy should go
the way of the R-word.

26:49.858 --> 26:50.900
R-word?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.485
Don't make me say it.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.112
-Retard--
-Got it, got it.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.743
Oh, you motherfucker!

26:59.993 --> 27:02.245
[Judy] What? What? What's wrong?

27:02.787 --> 27:03.705
Wait here.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.041
[rock music playing]

27:07.917 --> 27:09.252
[Judy] What are you doing?

27:10.003 --> 27:10.879
Jen?

27:14.549 --> 27:16.551
You shouldn't be able
to call someone crazy anymore.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.470
[car alarm wailing]

27:19.846 --> 27:20.722
[grunting]

27:24.726 --> 27:25.685
[man] Hey!

27:27.520 --> 27:28.396
Hey!

27:29.230 --> 27:30.857
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

27:30.940 --> 27:31.941
Get in the car!

27:32.609 --> 27:33.943
[Jen cackles]

27:35.278 --> 27:36.821
-Hey!
-[tires screech]
