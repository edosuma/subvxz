WEBVTT

03:24.955 --> 03:25.956
Stop right there.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.504
Get on the floor now.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.846
Ladies.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.190
I wouldn't do that.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.695
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?

03:56.778 --> 03:58.196
Lucy Swanson.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.992
Lucy was here a week ago
on a night out with her friends.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.828
Thing is, this is the
last place she was seen.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.790
Do you know how many bored
little rich girls run away from home?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.625
Happens every
day in the big city.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.419
Unfortunately,

04:12.502 --> 04:15.922
your boys did a terrible job
of disposing of the evidence.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.257
The police found
her body last night.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.427
Lucy's parents
are friends of mine,

04:20.510 --> 04:22.846
- so here I am.
- So here you are.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.431
So what now, then?

04:24.514 --> 04:28.143
Now, turn yourselves
in and confess.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.520
And what happens
if we say fuck you?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.275
- That.
- Kill this fucking prick.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.639
Haven't lost your touch, I see.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.724
Frost. What are you doing here?

05:08.725 --> 05:10.143
Got something to tell you.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.144
Nope.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.190
Don't you want to
know how I found you?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.776
Satellites, cameras, et cetera?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.154
John, look, I needed to
speak to you face to face.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.281
About a job.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.534
How many times?

05:25.617 --> 05:27.369
Not. Interested.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.787
You will be this time.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.871
It's Teague.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.793
Sean Teague is dead.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.795
This was taken yesterday.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.300
The operative who sent it was deep
undercover for the past two years.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.820
He was about to
take his targets down

05:43.844 --> 05:46.638
when he was introduced to an arms
dealer that turned out to be Teague.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.724
I'm putting a team together to catch
Teague, and I want you to lead it.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.727
You want me to bring
Teague in... alive?

05:52.811 --> 05:55.373
I know what he did to you and your
team, but we need Teague breathing.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.775
His intel and contacts alone are enough
to bring down the baddest of the bad.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.320
Come on, do it for your country.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.281
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.991
Okay, do it for yourself, then.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.493
- Meaning?
- Meaning you bring Teague in,

06:08.577 --> 06:12.497
in one piece, the department
wipes your slate clean.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.333
All is forgiven.
No more running.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.835
Think about it, John.

06:16.918 --> 06:21.423
Bring Teague in alive, and
you get your life back again.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.998
Gentlemen. Ladies.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.750
You all know Commander Grayson.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.877
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.881
Our target: Sean Teague.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.927
As you all know, Teague
was an elite operative,

07:07.010 --> 07:09.930
one of our best, until
he turned on his team

07:10.013 --> 07:13.892
during their final mission in
Eastern Europe several years ago.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.687
Many of them met
with rather grisly ends.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.897
Quite.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.860
After going rogue, Teague was responsible
for the deaths of dozens of personnel,

07:23.944 --> 07:27.155
as well as countless civilians in
mercenary operations across the globe.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.785
Arms deals, smuggling
state secrets, assassinations.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.162
You name it, Teague
profited from it.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.414
Well, yeah, he did.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.917
Until he was reported killed
two years ago in the ♪.R.C.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.795
Yes, well, we've
all heard that story.

07:41.878 --> 07:45.006
Authorities on the ground confirmed
that Teague had been killed,

07:45.090 --> 07:47.300
but he's here now, and
we're going to bring him in.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.053
Who's the tree trunk?

07:50.136 --> 07:53.306
You're kidding. It's
only John fucking Gold.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.141
- Get away.
- Uh-huh.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.437
Wonder how many
people he's killed this week.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.855
Five.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.941
So far.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.318
Nice to meet you.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.820
Likewise.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.239
Lynch and Shapiro, you've
somewhat preempted me.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.200
Everybody, meet John Gold.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.707
Nobody knows Teague better
than Gold, especially in the field.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.042
And nobody has a more
compelling reason to bring him in.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.006
From what I've heard, you'll more
likely put a bullet behind Teague's ear

08:24.045 --> 08:25.422
than put him behind bars.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.215
People do like
to talk, don't they?

08:27.298 --> 08:30.635
Your mission is breach
Teague's location,

08:30.719 --> 08:33.722
transport him to an
off-the-books airbase,

08:33.804 --> 08:39.102
then fly him to an ever-so-hush-hush
black site secure facility,

08:39.184 --> 08:41.980
where he'll live out
his days in a steel box.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.106
So what's the play, boss?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.733
Gold here will lead,

08:44.816 --> 08:48.862
with you two reprobates providing
ground support and flying/driving services.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.990
- Shit work. Standard.
- That's what we get paid for.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.994
What? They pay you for this?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.329
That's enough, you two.

08:58.413 --> 09:02.125
Kelso, Plachecki and Stiles, you'll
serve and support the operation from here.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.251
Any questions?

09:05.837 --> 09:08.214
'Course not. I'll
see you at the R.V.

09:12.594 --> 09:15.513
I'm sorry we can't give you the
support you need for this one, John.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.850
You know I can't be seen
to authorize a full team.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.478
If news about Teague
being alive got out,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.022
top brass will have
a major flap-on.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.024
But Lynch and Shapiro
are two of the best.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.530
Believe it or not.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.991
A team can be a liability.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.494
Teague taught me that.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.067
Morning, lads.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.068
- Boss.
- Boss.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.611
Nice morning for it.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.196
- Heard from Pearl yet?
- Not yet.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.281
We agreed on radio
silence until she arrives.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.658
Yeah, yeah, just in case.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.078
Pretty smart... coming from you.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.593
Okay, lads, we're here for the
duration until we hear from Pearl.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.220
Smoke 'em if you've got 'em.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.304
Come on.

10:46.563 --> 10:47.814
What's all this?

10:47.897 --> 10:51.276
What? Oh, uh, nothing.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.365
What is all this?

10:59.409 --> 11:00.493
[, uh...

11:01.703 --> 11:03.371
I-1 really need a piss.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.623
So go take a piss.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.375
What am I, your mother?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.447
Better than sex!

11:38.448 --> 11:39.824
Then you're doing it wrong.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.506
Fuck!

12:48.810 --> 12:50.728
Steady!

12:54.190 --> 12:57.235
As I live and
breathe. John Gold.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.238
Teague. You're coming with me.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.740
Yeah, of course I am.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.825
Lads!

13:28.766 --> 13:29.767
Bennett, move!

13:49.203 --> 13:50.580
Go.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.145
Go, go, go.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.608
Teague!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.906
Teague! Hands in the air!

15:06.989 --> 15:09.617
Don't stop us now. We're
just starting to have some fun.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.619
Assume the position.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.121
Or what?

15:22.463 --> 15:23.631
To be continued.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.385
Are you sure you're
going to make our window?

15:28.386 --> 15:30.447
We've got a tight timeframe
to get that plane in the air.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
Yeah, we'll make it.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.892
Our E.T.A's about 60 minutes.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.703
Okay, great. Just get
Teague to that airbase,

15:36.727 --> 15:39.522
- and we can all breathe out.
- Yep, copy that.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.568
Lynch and Shapiro are securing
Teague, and we'll be on our way in a few.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.404
Just make sure that
plane is good to go.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.740
Twat's ready for transport.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.909
Hey, you're going nowhere, mate.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.411
Here's Prince Charming now.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.247
I'll keep you
updated. Stay frosty.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.583
Yeah, funny, I've
never heard that before.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.754
This is excellent, by the way.

16:03.838 --> 16:04.922
I know.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.427
Good to go.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.138
Believe it or not, Teague,
this is all for your own good.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.891
You're being flown to a
remote, black site prison

16:14.974 --> 16:17.810
"cause there's too many people out
here that want your head on a pike."

16:17.894 --> 16:18.936
People like you?

16:19.020 --> 16:23.941
You're a traitor, you're a murderer,
and you sacrificed our own team.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.528
Now, you either pay
for those crimes this way,

16:27.612 --> 16:29.947
or someone's going to
tear you limb from limb.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.575
Alleged crimes.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.952
And I'm supposed to
believe all this from a man

16:35.036 --> 16:37.079
who wants to see me
dead more than most?

16:38.414 --> 16:42.460
For my own good,
eh? That's bullshit.

16:45.963 --> 16:46.964
Let's go.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.640
Get in! Get in!

17:01.562 --> 17:03.189
I knew it... you're
trying to kill me!

17:03.272 --> 17:05.358
Don't be ridiculous,
we'd just let him do it.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.858
Anyone got eyes on the shooter?

17:11.571 --> 17:13.991
Right, we need a
volunteer to draw their fire.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.542
Fuck off.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.592
- Fucking...!
- Where are they?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.719
Three o'clock, tower.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.013
Probably one of Teague's...

17:36.097 --> 17:39.225
- No, Teague's the target.
- Bollocks.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.227
Whoa...

17:42.853 --> 17:45.398
- Maybe.
- Let's go.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.899
On it.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.526
- Mine.
- Really?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.329
Lynch! Step on it.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.248
Hold onto your balls back there.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.548
Talk to me.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.551
We had an unexpected
guest, but we're on our way.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.302
Any idea who it was?

18:14.385 --> 18:16.846
Not a clue, but they
wanted Teague's head.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.180
And nearly got it.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.058
I'll keep you posted.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.563
We're on our way, people.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.064
Take it steady.

18:31.152 --> 18:35.072
Hey, hope you've got some nice, hot
stewardesses on this flight for me, John.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.160
I wouldn't get your hopes up, Teague.
You're going to prison, not Ibiza.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.883
And they're called
cabin crew these days.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.957
Touch a nerve there, did 1?

18:57.178 --> 18:58.929
Oh, for... We've got incoming.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.617
Shit!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.118
Lynch, floor it!

19:23.704 --> 19:24.997
Come on, then.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.146
Shit.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.984
Dead end!

20:04.120 --> 20:05.371
Brace! Brace!

20:05.454 --> 20:06.664
Move! Now!

20:26.767 --> 20:29.186
- Everyone all right?
- Fuck off.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.563
Lynch, you okay?

20:30.646 --> 20:33.023
Yeah, just great.

20:37.278 --> 20:39.697
Look, I don't give a shit
about whoever's out there.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.701
But you either give me a gun or
you get me the fuck out of here.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.371
Someone's finally got to the big,
bad, tough-as-fuck Sean Teague.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
I'll shake them by the hand.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.586
Gold.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.214
Check this out.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.633
You think we can make
it over to that factory?

20:59.717 --> 21:02.052
Yeah, that'll do for now.

21:03.053 --> 21:07.141
Okay, I'll draw his fire,
you two follow Lynch.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.935
I'll catch up to you once
I've dealt with our new friend.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.830
Or we could just hand
Teague over to whoever that is.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.105
You're supposed to protect me.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.732
Tell me again what my job is?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.233
Shapiro.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.735
You see, John?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.570
That's what it comes down to.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.739
Me, and a quarter-ounce of lead.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.243
Don't tempt me.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.456
Guys, if we're going,
we should go now.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.751
Right, then.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.474
Move!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.266
Who the fuck are you?

23:03.424 --> 23:04.675
Greetings.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.022
Now this... This
is gonna be fun.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.863
- How are we doing?
- We got held up again.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.865
Our new friend took out our van.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.366
There's something else.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.368
We were attacked
by another team.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.954
As in a different team
that attacked both of you?

23:38.417 --> 23:42.379
That is what the sentence
that I just said would mean, yes.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.881
Any idea who they were?

23:43.964 --> 23:47.885
I didn't hang around to find out.
I'm regrouping with the others now.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.562
Okay.

23:59.563 --> 24:03.400
We're not authorized, but fuck
this sitting on our thumbs shit.

24:03.484 --> 24:06.695
I'm going in there to
help our guys. Fancy it?

24:08.614 --> 24:09.698
Just say the word.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.450
That's what I like to hear.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.285
Let's get going, people.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.505
- How long should we give it?
- Ten minutes?

24:24.588 --> 24:26.924
I mean, we can't
wait much longer.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.430
Who was that back there?

24:33.514 --> 24:36.058
Didn't get a name.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.769
They're still out there.
Some others too.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.145
Others like who?

24:40.229 --> 24:43.315
No idea. You?

24:43.399 --> 24:44.942
How the fuck do I know?

24:45.025 --> 24:46.443
So it could be anyone, then.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.654
Right, we need to
get to that airbase.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.448
Take a look around, see if
we can find some wheels.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.867
You lot don't know what
you've got yourselves into.

24:53.951 --> 24:54.951
Quiet!

25:01.083 --> 25:02.083
Move!

25:25.691 --> 25:27.317
Gold.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.499
Gold.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.501
Gold!

25:47.087 --> 25:48.922
That's it. Get up.

25:53.594 --> 25:57.014
Say hello to my boys,
and my beautiful fiancée.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.477
We're going to use
this to keep track of you.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.272
How long does it take to work?

26:05.355 --> 26:06.675
Should already
be up and running.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.028
We're good.

26:12.613 --> 26:13.864
Just don't lose that phone.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.952
I told you there'd be no
plane for me, didn't 1?

26:19.036 --> 26:20.537
You just wouldn't listen.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.164
You're going nowhere, Teague.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.999
It's Mr. Teague to you.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.043
Cut these, Gunnar.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.423
Keep them here.

26:31.507 --> 26:34.259
Any trouble, you
kill the chick first.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.552
Fuck you!

26:38.138 --> 26:40.057
You got it, boss.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.576
When you're all done
with the womanfolk...

27:00.661 --> 27:04.581
why don't you just come show
us how tough you really are?

27:24.184 --> 27:25.727
I'm gonna need this.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.606
Moan feebly if that's okay.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.485
Good. Right.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.613
I'm gonna go kill those guys,
while you go after Teague.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.323
Right...

27:38.407 --> 27:40.284
But don't engage him.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.952
Just let me know where you are.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.120
Yeah, but hold on. I...

27:43.203 --> 27:44.203
Hey, Gold!

27:45.038 --> 27:48.250
I always heard you were some
kind of one-man killing machine.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.128
So, what're you waiting for?

27:51.211 --> 27:54.965
Hang on, I'll be through in a
second to kick your teeth in.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.179
Go find Teague, and let
me know where you are.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.639
We'll get him together.

28:02.723 --> 28:06.143
Okay. Don't get
killed and stuff.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.187
You too.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.153
Right, then.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.532
You all right, mate?

28:30.876 --> 28:31.876
Finally.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.172
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gold.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.255
Likewise.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.009
So...

28:39.092 --> 28:41.637
you're John Gold.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.680
The John Gold?

28:43.764 --> 28:45.182
Yep.

28:45.265 --> 28:50.020
You know, Teague told us all these
stories about how bloodthirsty you are.

28:50.103 --> 28:55.442
Yet here we all
are with... these.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.819
And there you are with...

28:59.780 --> 29:01.406
With that.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.367
I mean, what're you
even going to do with...

29:29.518 --> 29:31.061
- Kendrick, get the car.
- Okay.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.730
- Be out of here in five.
- Knew you'd come through, babe.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.232
Teague!

29:37.192 --> 29:38.360
Stay where you are.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.738
Look, we've got somewhere to
go. Why don't you just back off?

29:45.826 --> 29:48.245
What? This shouldn't take long.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.747
Yeah, you're right, it'll
take me about 30 seconds.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.018
Maybe we should offer her a job.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.821
Fuck...

31:18.251 --> 31:19.878
Shoot him!

31:21.505 --> 31:23.340
Say goodbye, prick-hole.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.843
Shit!

31:26.927 --> 31:27.844
Stoppage.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.930
Okay, okay.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.357
Let's get bloody.

31:48.198 --> 31:51.368
- Get behind me.
- Do something, then.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.122
Just stay back.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.878
Step aside. This
isn't your fight.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.381
Who are you? Who is she?

32:04.464 --> 32:07.592
Long story, but
she should be dead.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.970
Oh, your men tried all right.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.013
You're trying to save
the life of a murderer,

32:12.097 --> 32:15.600
which makes you naive at
best, but you're not my problem.

32:15.684 --> 32:18.437
Just get out of my way,
I don't want to hurt you.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.440
Then don't. But I'm not moving.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.608
We're taking Teague
to prison, to face justice.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.402
This is justice!

32:32.993 --> 32:34.411
Well, come on, do it!

32:34.494 --> 32:36.621
Don't rush me!

32:36.705 --> 32:39.416
I'm killing a hero here.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.252
It's a big moment for me.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.425
Any last words?

32:51.428 --> 32:54.639
Prepare to be
deeply embarrassed.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.855
He's a live one, all right!

33:04.941 --> 33:07.152
But not for long.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.406
Here it comes.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.458
Well, stop dicking
around and kill him!

33:22.459 --> 33:23.459
I'm trying...

33:30.175 --> 33:31.593
Last chance. Walk away.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.013
Okay.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.392
I tried.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.505
All right.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.520
Getting paid
overtime for this, right?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.679
Well, thanks for all your help.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.318
You okay?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.946
Where's Lynch?

34:34.739 --> 34:37.742
Right, I'll deal with that,
you go cover the entrance.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.161
We don't need any
more unexpected guests.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.746
Roger that.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.389
Use this.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.255
Stand back, babe.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.136
Come on, babe! Let's go.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.521
If you...

36:13.463 --> 36:14.463
Teague!

36:19.678 --> 36:21.078
You want to have
a go hand-to-hand?

36:22.222 --> 36:24.140
Yeah, I fancy my chances.

36:49.916 --> 36:52.168
Hey. Whoever you are.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.629
I can see you've
got your reasons,

36:54.713 --> 36:57.215
but let us bring
Teague in the right way.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.591
You don't understand, he...

37:11.771 --> 37:13.690
Dumb fucking luck!

37:15.775 --> 37:17.444
You're amazing, but give it up.

37:17.527 --> 37:18.695
Get real!

37:27.203 --> 37:28.747
Gold!

37:28.830 --> 37:30.290
Lynch! Hold on!

38:17.337 --> 38:18.254
You okay?

38:18.338 --> 38:20.256
We had a disagreement.

38:20.340 --> 38:21.925
That's her specialty.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.426
Long time, no see, Jen.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.053
You know her?

38:25.136 --> 38:27.931
Jen Quaid. I served
with her father.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.432
Until Teague ended all that.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.311
Let me go, Gold. I've
got no problem with you.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.980
Not this time. We're
taking Teague to prison.

38:36.064 --> 38:39.108
Three square meals a day
and a roof over his head?

38:39.192 --> 38:41.945
After everything he's done?

38:42.028 --> 38:44.781
That's not nearly
enough, and you know it.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.544
I'm amazed you haven't
killed him yourself.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.409
He's come close.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.204
This is bigger than what
Teague's done to either of us.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.208
You've got clean
hands, is that it?

38:55.291 --> 38:58.127
My dad told me
about every mission.

38:58.211 --> 39:01.631
All the horrible, fucked-up
shit you guys did together.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.383
And that's my point.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.301
Do you want to end up like us?

39:05.385 --> 39:08.638
We both know that's not the
path your dad wanted for you.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.141
So don't make this
harder than it has to be.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.003
He's off again.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.337
What do you want me to do?

39:41.421 --> 39:43.882
Call Frost. Check on Shapiro.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.009
Then catch up with me.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.928
I'll catch you later.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.266
Boss.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.559
- Lynch?
- Yeah, it's me.

39:54.642 --> 39:56.519
- Go ahead.
- We caught up with the sniper.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.271
Name's Jen Quaid.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.898
Christ, really?

39:59.981 --> 40:01.524
Gold and I worked
with her old man.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.359
Yeah, that's right.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.987
She's tied up on the upper
level of our current location,

40:06.070 --> 40:07.864
- if you want to pick her up.
- Copy that.

40:13.453 --> 40:16.539
I've got Gold after me, and
I've got Jen Quaid after me,

40:16.623 --> 40:18.875
so come and pick me up now.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.501
We've got your position.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.295
Just keep moving,
and we'll come to you.

40:26.049 --> 40:29.385
Gunnar, Price. Let's get movin'.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.140
It's okay, chum. It's okay.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.786
Even if you get Teague
to that prison cell,

40:54.869 --> 40:56.412
how long do you
think he'll last?

40:56.496 --> 40:58.081
That's not my problem.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.833
My mission ends
once he's in that cell.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.169
All the shit Teague
has on the government.

41:03.252 --> 41:07.632
All those black bag, disavowable
jobs he did with my dad and Gold?

41:07.715 --> 41:11.427
They just want him in there so that
they can make sure he dies on their terms.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.846
Well, seeing as you want
Teague dead so badly,

41:13.930 --> 41:15.515
why don't you
let us bring him in,

41:15.598 --> 41:17.433
and he'll get what
you think he deserves.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.517
No!

41:20.979 --> 41:22.689
I have to kill him myself.

41:25.858 --> 41:26.943
Jen.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.448
Jen.

41:34.242 --> 41:36.482
Do you really think your dad
would want you to go through

41:36.536 --> 41:40.957
all this emotional agony and
violence, just to murder this one man?

41:42.667 --> 41:43.960
Yes.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.965
Okay, that's not
crazy or anything.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.299
See you around.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.720
Preferably not.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.439
You're coming with me.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.607
I'm going nowhere with you.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.109
We don't have time for this.

42:08.192 --> 42:09.819
You're not listening to me.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.446
Or do you want me
to beat it into you?

42:11.529 --> 42:13.740
I said we don't
have time for this.

42:13.823 --> 42:16.117
How many of your mates
did I have killed again?

42:17.702 --> 42:19.287
They were good men.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.498
And you sold them
out for cold, hard cash.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.500
I didn't do it for the
money, and you know that!

42:24.584 --> 42:26.252
Teague! Just listen...

42:37.305 --> 42:39.265
Just like old times.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.517
Always did like giving the
orders, didn't you, John?

42:47.648 --> 42:49.233
This is your last warning.

42:49.317 --> 42:52.111
If it wasn't for me, Jen Quaid
would have killed you by now.

42:52.195 --> 42:54.614
If it weren't for you slowing
me down, I'd have killed her!

43:23.810 --> 43:26.062
I put everything on
the line for this country,

43:26.145 --> 43:29.273
and I get made the scapegoat
for mistakes made over my head.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.276
Shit rolls downhill.
You know that.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.780
Years of loyal service, and I
get thrown on the scrapheap.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.449
Well, that's no excuse for
betraying your own team.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.128
You wouldn't understand
until it happened to you.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.423
Why don't you
just admit it, John?

43:54.507 --> 43:56.926
You're enjoying this.

43:58.302 --> 44:01.430
That's it. That's the
Gold I remember.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.015
Come on!

44:17.155 --> 44:19.282
Lynch advised that
Qaid is on the upper level.

44:20.283 --> 44:21.283
Be ready to move in.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.049
Is this what you want?

44:37.133 --> 44:39.135
Is this what you fucking want?

44:42.221 --> 44:43.055
Enough...

44:43.139 --> 44:45.474
Are you fucking
happy now, Teague?

44:46.559 --> 44:47.560
Gold!

44:50.229 --> 44:52.648
Hey, John.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.653
You're killing him.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.879
I'll call the team
to pick us up.

45:14.962 --> 45:19.050
No. Let's just get to
the airbase ourselves.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.677
The three of us will be
harder for Jen to track.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.679
You really think Jen's
still gonna be a problem?

45:23.763 --> 45:26.182
There's one thing you need
to know about Jen Quaid.

45:27.183 --> 45:29.477
She's always going
to be a problem.

45:32.647 --> 45:33.689
Hello, boys.

45:35.274 --> 45:36.692
Frost.

45:36.776 --> 45:38.361
You know the routine, Jen.

45:38.444 --> 45:41.697
Down on the ground.
Hands behind your head.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.339
All right?

45:58.422 --> 46:00.883
I want a chat about hazard
pay, but apart from that...

46:02.009 --> 46:03.719
I'm a-okay.

46:03.803 --> 46:06.722
Jen, I had a lot of
respect for your old man.

46:06.806 --> 46:09.225
But we have to treat
you as an active threat,

46:09.308 --> 46:12.019
so just behave and
let us bring you in.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.107
What're we doing?

46:16.190 --> 46:18.859
She's just some chick.
She's not even strapped.

46:18.943 --> 46:22.738
That "chick" nearly
killed us all. Twice.

46:24.448 --> 46:25.449
She's amazing.

46:27.827 --> 46:30.246
Kelso. Cuff her.

46:44.552 --> 46:45.636
Take cover!

46:55.646 --> 46:57.648
Let's find some wheels.

46:59.567 --> 47:02.028
This is a wild goose chase.

47:02.111 --> 47:04.113
I'm done, I ain't
going any further.

47:06.365 --> 47:07.825
Fine.

47:07.908 --> 47:09.452
You stay here, then,

47:09.535 --> 47:12.997
wait for Jen to catch up
and shoot you in the head.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.219
You fucking arsehole.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.109
Hold fire! Hold fire!

47:44.612 --> 47:45.821
Jen!

47:45.905 --> 47:47.323
This is your last chance!

47:48.324 --> 47:49.867
Surrender!

47:51.410 --> 47:52.828
Right now!

47:59.627 --> 48:00.836
Check it out.

48:05.007 --> 48:08.344
Be careful. She's much more
dangerous than she looks.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.932
Okay, on me.

48:47.591 --> 48:48.926
Foyer clear.

48:49.009 --> 48:51.720
You two, clear the upper
floor. We'll check this level.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.223
<i>- RV. back here.
- Roger that. Let's go.</i>

48:55.599 --> 48:56.892
Keep comms open.

48:56.976 --> 48:59.979
- You heard the boss. Don't get brave.
- Understood.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.551
Just some chick?

49:30.634 --> 49:31.677
I didn't mean...

50:24.647 --> 50:26.398
Someone talk to me.

50:27.650 --> 50:28.984
What's going on?

50:44.500 --> 50:45.501
You okay?

50:54.093 --> 50:56.178
Kelso?

50:56.262 --> 50:57.555
Stiles?

51:35.718 --> 51:37.052
What about this one?

51:53.986 --> 51:56.739
Yeah. I can work with this.

51:58.324 --> 51:59.644
You think you
can get it running?

52:00.576 --> 52:02.077
Please.

52:07.333 --> 52:08.542
Gold?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.385
Cheers.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.130
Right, straight to the airbase.

52:55.214 --> 52:57.466
- Roger that.
- You hear that, Teague?

52:57.549 --> 53:00.427
Very soon we'll be
flying the friendly skies.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.138
We'll see about that.

53:18.487 --> 53:20.406
How's that, Gunnar babe?

53:23.242 --> 53:24.660
You look quite lovely, miss.

53:28.580 --> 53:31.500
Not far now. Take the next left.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.086
You got it.

53:46.265 --> 53:47.599
Okay.

53:47.683 --> 53:51.186
Okay. So she got one over on me.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.230
Can one of you at least
give me something to wear?

53:54.481 --> 53:56.233
Sure. Here.

53:59.611 --> 54:02.698
Quaid deactivated the
vehicle tracking system.

54:02.781 --> 54:05.617
- She could be anywhere.
- Smart move.

54:05.701 --> 54:07.453
Come on, you lot.
Let's get moving.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.968
We're making good
time. Not far now.

54:23.051 --> 54:26.054
Yeah, as long as this rust
bucket makes it that far.

54:52.331 --> 54:53.749
Jesus...!

54:53.832 --> 54:55.250
Come on, we've got to move.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.007
This way, Mr. Teague.

55:03.509 --> 55:04.551
That's fucked, innit?

55:04.635 --> 55:06.094
Teague!

55:06.178 --> 55:07.721
Let's go.

55:09.515 --> 55:12.267
Sean! Come on, let's go.

55:29.868 --> 55:31.245
You okay?

55:32.496 --> 55:35.290
I'm seeing three of you.
Other than that, I'm good.

55:36.917 --> 55:38.752
Right, I'm going
to go after them.

55:38.836 --> 55:41.380
You R.V. with Frost, and
I'll see you at the airbase.

55:41.463 --> 55:42.463
On it.

55:51.890 --> 55:53.642
Fucker don't know when to quit.

55:57.813 --> 55:58.814
I've got this.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.526
Guard her with your life.

56:09.449 --> 56:11.910
- What's he doing?
- He needs to see this through, miss.

56:22.004 --> 56:23.839
This fucking guy.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.801
Go and finish him.

56:33.223 --> 56:34.223
Sean!

56:41.857 --> 56:43.150
Not her again.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.412
Shit.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.254
Who is that?

57:06.632 --> 57:09.384
That's the daughter of a
man I killed a long time ago.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.389
Gold.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.808
Jen, listen...

57:16.892 --> 57:19.353
I understand why you
want to kill Teague.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.147
And trust me, I want
to put a bullet in him too.

57:22.230 --> 57:23.899
But it's not gonna
bring back my men.

57:25.484 --> 57:27.402
And it's not gonna
bring back your dad.

57:28.779 --> 57:32.407
So, please, help me
to do this the right way.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.125
Here.

57:43.502 --> 57:46.630
- Kill them both.
- You got it.

57:49.007 --> 57:50.759
You get Teague,
I'll get the other guy.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.810
Not bad.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.497
We've got to make that plane.

58:20.580 --> 58:23.000
Why the fuck would I
go anywhere with you?

58:23.083 --> 58:26.461
Well, in case you've
forgotten, that's Jen Quaid.

58:26.545 --> 58:29.464
You know he's killed
his own men, right?

58:29.548 --> 58:31.967
- Really going to take his money?
- I'm a mercenary.

58:33.051 --> 58:35.470
The clue is in the
job description.

58:35.554 --> 58:38.890
A highly trained killing machine
who's been following you all day,

58:38.974 --> 58:43.103
and so far everything you've
tried to do to stop her has failed.

58:44.104 --> 58:47.482
Now, are you sure your guy's
got what it takes to bring her down?

58:51.570 --> 58:53.280
"Cause I've got to
be honest with you..."

58:54.740 --> 58:55.991
My money's on her.

59:08.754 --> 59:10.130
Now, move it!

59:36.531 --> 59:37.532
You know what?

59:37.616 --> 59:40.035
I might just stick around
and see how this pans out.

59:44.748 --> 59:46.291
You know...

59:46.374 --> 59:49.044
I'm really starting
to enjoy this job.

59:55.634 --> 59:57.302
Damn it, Jen.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:03.391
I've got to say, fighting you
has been a bit of a thrill for me.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.868
Best part is, you're next.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.624
You did good, by the way.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.085
You've got some moves.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:34.422
And you've got fighting spirit.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.470
But now it's time to say...

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.060
Come on, let's go.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.481
Fucking prick.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:55.819
Ah, fuck.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.114
Sean! Go!

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.619
Price, Gunnar. Shoot them!

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:08.415
Go after Teague, I'll cover you.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.376
You really want to take
on this lot by yourself?

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.460
You would.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.594
Go now, before we lose him!

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:22.887
Take cover!

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.319
Gunnar, Price, move in.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:52.250
Close in, we'll surround her.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.047
Right, then.

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.014
Fuck me. You're like
herpes... I can't get rid of you.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.683
On. Now.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:09.935
Move in.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.705
Shit.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.084
She's a tricky one all right.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.566
Room for one more?

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.616
That your summer
look or something?

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:08.743
Don't want to talk about it.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.745
But where are your
trousers, though?

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.414
What's the latest?

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.416
Teague's men grabbed
him, and Gold was...

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:20.380
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appear.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.758
Gold, you're on speaker and
I'm with the gang, so no sexy talk.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.760
Gold! Let me off
this fucking thing!

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.512
- So you got him again, then.
- Yup.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.764
- I got some wheels too.
- Cool.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.766
We'll be at the airbase
in about ten minutes.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.269
Roger that. I'll see you soon.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.271
You heard the man, let's go.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:53.204
Fucking dead man,
Gold, do you hear me?

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.206
Fucking dead man.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:56.791
You might want to hold on tight.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.793
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:16.478
Well? Did you get her?

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:49.010
- Enjoy the ride?
- You're a prick.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:52.347
Any more trouble out of you, and
I'll be carrying you onto that plane.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:55.266
And how much trouble
do you think I can get in?

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.351
Just move.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:17.872
Your gun, please.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.464
That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.889
Now the keys, please.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:38.893
You know, you might be the most
polite mercenary I've ever encountered.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.562
That's very kind of you to say.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.278
And we're taking the plane.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.906
We're flying out of here.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:55.410
No, you're getting on that
plane, and you're going to prison.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.912
I've had enough of this
you-and-me bollocks.

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.539
Get on your knees.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.170
Do as you're told.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.761
You might want to
stand back, darling.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:19.934
This is over.

01:06:21.519 --> 01:06:22.937
Now.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:24.021
Hey, Teague.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.669
That was quite the entrance.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.796
Dad always said I was dramatic.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.010
Shit. Teague's guys
are already here.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:38.471
Stiles. Take point.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.299
Let's go get these bastards.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:24.058
Okay, stay here, you'll be safe.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.185
Do what you've got to do.

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:41.576
Move in.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:56.591
I'm nearly out.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:57.759
You?

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.095
Don't ask.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.229
Go!

01:10:02.657 --> 01:10:03.658
Fuck.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.195
Believe it or not, this is
how I killed your old man!

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:04.051
Let's just go!

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:09.682
No, I can't, I've got to stay.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.559
- No.
- I've got to finish this.

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:26.323
John!

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.744
You're really starting to
fucking irritate me now.

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.750
In my office.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.145
Just... Kill him... already!

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.685
Ladies.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.354
Ladies.

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:24.358
Do you really think
you can take me?

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:18.597
Fuck...

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:37.658
It's your choice.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:40.554
Jen...

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.677
I've been there.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.270
What're we going
to do with him now?

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.147
This ain't over, John.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.607
Believe me, this ain't over.

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:37.111
I'm coming for
your friends, John!

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.196
I'm coming for your kids, John!

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.115
I'm coming for your dog!

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:45.619
Well, it may not be a
plane, but he's on his way.

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:46.954
Well done.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.625
We'll debrief tomorrow at 0900.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:53.127
Did we win this one, then?

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:56.130
Beers are on me, so I guess.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.969
Victory. Yay.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.141
I'll see you in the pub.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.812
You know, Teague's probably
gonna die in that prison.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.445
Maybe.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.074
