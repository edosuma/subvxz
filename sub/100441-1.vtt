01:39.933 --> 01:40.809
Hello.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.312
<i>Rendell Locke is dead.</i>

01:45.855 --> 01:46.773
What?

01:47.941 --> 01:48.775
What happened?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.360
<i>You know what happened.</i>

01:59.869 --> 02:01.121
I know what I need to do.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.511
- Let's play a game.
- Bode, no.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.472
We can play "I Saw a Monster,"

03:42.555 --> 03:44.265
"Whack-A-Bode" or "Serious Question"?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.267
-No Whack-A-Bode in the car.
- Okay.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.685
Serious Questions, then.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.312
Serious Question:

03:49.395 --> 03:51.564
If you had to lose one sense,
what would it be?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.566
Right now, my sense of hearing.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.944
It's a serious question, Kinsey.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.696
-Pass.
-Boring. Tyler?

03:58.780 --> 04:00.323
Tyler?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.116
- Tyler!
- One more time

04:02.200 --> 04:03.868
and G.I. Joe loses a leg.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.037
I think that's the first thing you've said
since Ohio.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.373
I said something in Ohio?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.875
Yeah. You said, "Oh look, we're in Ohio."

04:10.959 --> 04:12.168
Oh. I was right.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.128
Now I have a serious question.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.173
What would you be doing right now

04:17.257 --> 04:18.341
if we were still in Seattle?

04:18.424 --> 04:21.010
I'd either be playing Fortnite
with Stuart and Wyatt

04:21.094 --> 04:23.763
or I'd be playing Fortnite
with Stuart and Chase.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.640
What would you be doing, Ty?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.476
I would be on a French Club ski trip
with Sarah Johnson.

04:29.727 --> 04:30.895
You took Spanish.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.106
Why isn't anyone playing for real?

04:33.189 --> 04:35.441
Definitely wouldn't wanna lose
my sense of smell.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.360
Smell is tied to memory.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.529
When your father and I would sell a house,

04:39.612 --> 04:42.198
we'd grind up a lemon
in the garbage disposal.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.284
Covers the smell of the paint.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.706
No one likes the smell of paint.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.958
But everyone...

04:54.794 --> 04:57.297
everyone has a good memory of a lemon.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.221
Hey, check it out. We're here.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.227
Whoa...

05:45.636 --> 05:48.056
Okay, let's stop, huh?
Check out the town.

05:49.140 --> 05:49.974
Yeah.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.644
Hey, who wants ice cream?

05:53.853 --> 05:54.687
Me!

05:54.771 --> 05:56.564
- You're kidding, right?

06:13.748 --> 06:14.749
Come on, Rufus!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.712
- Must've just missed the rush.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.549
Only pregnant women and masochists
crave ice cream in this weather.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.593
-We're one of two.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.345
I like your bracelet.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.973
-Thanks.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.563
It's on the house, Mrs. Locke.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.731
Mm!

06:39.190 --> 06:40.024
Newcomers discount.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.568
That's very kind of you.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.488
We don't need charity.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.572
It's hospitality.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.199
Welcome to Matheson.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.914
How does he know who we are?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.519
Oh, cool!

07:31.993 --> 07:33.161
Whoa!

07:33.786 --> 07:35.288
Are we rich?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.165
I don't know if I'd say rich,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.750
so much as very lucky kids.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.295
Yeah, I feel so lucky.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.756
It's bigger than the pictures.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.717
It's also a little more Norman Bates.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.510
How come
dad never brought us here?

07:49.594 --> 07:52.513
He'd say it was a depressing shithole
that wasn't fit for derelicts.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.682
-Paraphrasing.

07:54.765 --> 07:55.641
Hey!

07:56.350 --> 07:57.310
Welcome to Key House!

07:57.393 --> 07:59.145
Uncle Duncan! Uncle Duncan!

07:59.228 --> 08:00.855
We have a house with a name!

08:00.938 --> 08:02.940
Well, puns are a Locke family tradition.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.150
How was Boston?

08:05.401 --> 08:07.778
It was good.
I wanted to get you guys something

08:07.862 --> 08:10.740
to mark the occasion of coming
to your ancestral home for the first time.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.288
Wanted to get you something
like a plant but then I was running late,

08:17.371 --> 08:18.873
I didn't want to miss the movers, so...

08:19.624 --> 08:20.958
that's for you.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.793
That's for you.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.879
Okay...

08:27.798 --> 08:29.300
-Who wants to see inside?

08:29.383 --> 08:30.218
-Me!

08:30.301 --> 08:31.802
Okay, let's go!

08:32.303 --> 08:33.387
- Yeah!
- Whoa!

08:37.850 --> 08:39.602
- Holy sh--
- Jesus.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.481
Well, you saw
that your other car got here.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.359
The movers unloaded
the rest of your boxes so...

08:47.652 --> 08:49.195
all you have to do is unpack.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.988
Oh, my god, these floors are original.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.699
-Oh, it's all original.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.617
Quick tour.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.452
This is the drawing room.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.995
Ooh. Drawing room.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.040
That's good for you, Kinsey.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.876
She likes to draw just like you,
Uncle Duncan.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.127
A drawing room is where people

09:05.211 --> 09:07.964
would go drink and smoke cigars
after dinner, snot-gobbler.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.715
Well then why don't they call it that?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.552
And this...

09:14.136 --> 09:15.471
well, this is the Winter Study.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.307
Our ancestors amassed
a pretty big library.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.603
Historical stuff.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.356
-Revolutionary War.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.358
Books on Matheson.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.859
-Weaponry.
- Wow.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.611
-Can't wait to dive in.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.574
Okay...

09:36.158 --> 09:37.994
Washer, dryer...

09:38.911 --> 09:42.623
basement is down the steps, on your left.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.668
It's chilly in here,

09:45.751 --> 09:47.378
has the insulation ever been replaced?

09:47.545 --> 09:50.840
Well, replaced would imply
that it was ever added.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.968
This place is huge! It just keeps going!

09:54.051 --> 09:56.345
And this is the Great Room.
It's multi-functional.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.680
Living room,

09:57.763 --> 10:00.683
-creepy portrait gallery.
- Who are these guys?

10:01.183 --> 10:02.977
Well, this... is Devon Locke.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.896
He still holds the high score
in the Galaga machine at Stan's Pizza.

10:07.732 --> 10:08.774
And this is Snooki,

10:08.858 --> 10:11.902
Lemonjello, Buzz Lightyear,
Snooki the Second,

10:11.986 --> 10:12.945
Phoebe, Chandler

10:13.029 --> 10:14.614
and Monica, but...

10:15.406 --> 10:16.949
the most famous relative,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.409
no one's ever seen.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.746
The Locke-ness Monster

10:24.040 --> 10:26.917
-That's not even spelled the same.
- Concluding our tour

10:27.001 --> 10:28.252
in the kitchen.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.088
Excellent.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.259
Okay, guys. Unpack, explore.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.137
-Let's do this thing.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.725
Tyler. Want to pick rooms?

10:43.434 --> 10:44.435
You pick for me.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.114
Hmm...

10:58.157 --> 10:59.367
I sense a theme.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.910
I'm applying to Parsons

11:01.035 --> 11:02.745
-for their summer program.
-Hmm.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.498
I have to submit one sketch
of a bicycle.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.249
Famously hard to draw.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.542
Exactly.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.960
They all look warped.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.129
Warped isn't a bad thing.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.632
Just ask Picasso.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.760
Yeah...

11:54.088 --> 11:55.923
You wouldn't do that
if Dad were still here.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.177
If Dad were still here,
we'd be in Seattle, dum-dum.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.097
Serious question, Tyler.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.641
Are you okay?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.103
I mean, I know none of us are okay, but...

12:10.354 --> 12:11.814
you seem really far away.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.570
I know you and Dad were fighting a lot
right before.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.578
Are you okay?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.122
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.499
Frickin' liar.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.044
I can't believe that guy already knew
who we were.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.463
Get used to it.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.339
Tomorrow at school
it's gonna be even worse.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.927
You wanna know something real stupid?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.848
When I saw this place,
the first thing I wanted to do

12:45.931 --> 12:47.391
was text a picture to Dad.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.852
He'd really like this.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.563
You know what?

12:53.481 --> 12:54.398
I think we should.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.859
Come on.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.792
Check my work, boss?

13:55.042 --> 13:56.126
<i>♪ It's the time ♪</i>

13:57.461 --> 13:58.546
<i>♪ Of the season ♪</i>

13:59.046 --> 14:00.005
Hmm...

14:00.881 --> 14:02.132
Exquisite job.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.510
I'd say you're ready to move upstairs.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.472
-Is that an invitation?
- To paint.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.851
-Do I have to go?
-Yes.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.478
Is it so bad that in our busy lives

14:14.562 --> 14:17.523
I want to spend the afternoon
working in the same room as my wife?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.316
One coat in the bedroom, two in the bath.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.694
Yes, boss.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
I love you.

14:24.154 --> 14:24.989
Love you, too.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.824
I'm twerp-hunting,
have you seen him?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.325
We're playing Whack-A-Bode.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.785
Uh... No.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.663
I don't know where Bode is.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.540
- Try the basement.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.710
<i>♪ What's your name? ♪</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:41.505
Tyler forgot his key. Again.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.305
Oh. Hi. You're--

Sam. Sam Lesser.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.017
-I know Ty.
- Right. He's at hockey practice.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.393
Actually I came to see Mr. Locke.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.770
-Sam.
- Come in.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.981
-Everything all right?
- Must be freezing.

14:59.940 --> 15:00.941
I just need to talk.

15:02.776 --> 15:03.652
Well, uh...

15:03.777 --> 15:05.696
Why don't you come by my office

15:05.779 --> 15:07.114
at school first thing Monday?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.407
It really can't wait.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.660
We can talk Monday, Sam.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.374
No, no, we can't.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.252
-Tell me everything I need to know.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.087
Sam.
I need you to put that down.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.005
I don't think so.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.215
Well, I'm not talking to you
when you're holding a gun.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.259
-You sure? You might wanna reconsider.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.310
Tell me what I need to know
about Key House!

15:36.393 --> 15:39.271
Whatever you think you understand
about that place...

15:40.481 --> 15:42.191
-you don't.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.276
- Dad! No!

15:44.360 --> 15:45.694
-Dad!

15:48.906 --> 15:50.407
-It's locked!

15:50.824 --> 15:53.202
No, no, no, no!

15:53.285 --> 15:55.537
Open the door, please! Mom!

17:26.920 --> 17:27.796
No!

18:09.838 --> 18:11.090
Hello?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.428
Hello!

18:19.723 --> 18:21.809
Are you my echo?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.649
Yes.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.152
I am...

18:32.402 --> 18:33.695
Bode.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.457
Um... Hey, Dunc,

18:45.707 --> 18:48.335
weren't you in charge
of taking care of this place?

18:49.920 --> 18:51.255
Well, I've been very busy.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.006
-Teaching drunk ladies to paint?
-Exactly.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.509
It's time-consuming. And exhausting.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.137
Well, have there been any updates

18:58.220 --> 18:59.096
to the plumbing?

18:59.179 --> 19:01.265
-Electrical? Heating?
-Hmm...

19:02.015 --> 19:02.850
Roof?

19:02.933 --> 19:05.269
-I've been very consistent in my neglect.
-Okay,

19:05.352 --> 19:09.481
so, both you and Rendell
have avoided this place like the plague.

19:10.649 --> 19:11.608
It wasn't a happy place.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.153
Well, if you both hated it so much,
why didn't you just sell it?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.238
I wanted to, believe me,
but Rendell wouldn't let me.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.073
But once you fix it up,

19:18.157 --> 19:20.617
we can sell Key House for jillions
and you can move anywhere.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.286
No, that's not the plan.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.454
I mean, I need a project.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.456
My kids need a home.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.167
Does it have to be this project?

19:30.544 --> 19:31.753
This home?

19:36.049 --> 19:39.511
Listen, Bode's freaking out.
He says there's a girl in the well house.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.231
Hey, sweetheart, let me check it out.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.361
Okay, the door's locked,
do you have the key?

19:57.154 --> 19:58.363
I haven't seen it in years.

19:58.488 --> 20:00.782
No reason to go in,
the well's contaminated with sea water.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.659
There's no one in here.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.579
I heard a voice, I swear!

20:05.662 --> 20:08.207
-Maybe you heard an echo.
-Yeah, that's what she said!

20:08.290 --> 20:10.709
-She said she was my echo!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.045
Oh.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.880
Okay, listen, now, bud.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.258
That's not a safe place to play.
The roof is old

20:18.342 --> 20:19.718
and it might collapse
at any minute.

20:19.801 --> 20:20.969
It's full of bats and tetanus.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.930
If you go near it again,
I'll beat your ass.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.389
I know what I heard.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.599
I'm not lying!

20:25.682 --> 20:26.683
There is a girl in there!

20:26.767 --> 20:28.143
It's been a long day,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.311
we're all tired.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.521
Come on, now. Let's call it a night.

20:32.105 --> 20:32.940
Come on.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.995

20:59.049 --> 21:00.509

21:03.136 --> 21:04.137

21:11.061 --> 21:12.729
Is this an eggshell
or a fingernail?

21:14.106 --> 21:14.940
Ew.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.154
Sorry.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.572
Eggshell.

21:23.115 --> 21:23.949
Want a, um...

21:24.491 --> 21:25.659
frozen waffle?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.744
They gave me a swipe card
for the dining hall, so...

21:27.828 --> 21:28.662
Okay.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.377
Hey, like the new look.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.546
Yeah, it's very "saving it for Jesus."

21:38.130 --> 21:39.423
Forget your eye drops in Seattle?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.424
Guys,

21:40.507 --> 21:41.758
same team. Omelets?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.260
It's eggshell free.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.137
I'm not hungry.

21:56.815 --> 21:57.816
Oh, god.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.236
That's disgusting.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.363
You're so lucky it's a week
before your school starts.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.240
Someone has to map out the house.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.451
How are we in boarding school
and aren't even boarding?

22:07.534 --> 22:09.453
They also have day students.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.288
Listen, guys.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.205
Hey,

22:12.289 --> 22:14.791
going to a new school,
starting in the middle of the year,

22:14.875 --> 22:16.043
sure, it might suck, but,

22:16.168 --> 22:17.336
also it might not.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.505
-Stellar pep talk, Mom.
-Yeah, wait, let me write that down.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.049
What did I forget?
Permission slips?

22:22.132 --> 22:25.260
Ty, you have that hockey thingamabob.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.262
-Medical consent.
-Already turned it in.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.806
I forged your signature.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.308
And I sent an email

22:31.391 --> 22:33.727
from your account to the Assistant Head
so we can catch up on

22:33.810 --> 22:34.686
whatever we've missed.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.521
Great. Okay.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.731
Okay, next time,

22:38.648 --> 22:39.941
I got it, just ask me, okay?

22:40.650 --> 22:41.943
Good morning, guys!

22:42.903 --> 22:44.696
Gonna head back to work in Boston.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.783
Never fear,
Uncle Dunc'll be back tomorrow.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.327
Later.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.495
Bye, Uncle Duncan!

22:52.537 --> 22:54.289
I really know how to clear a room.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.960
-I believe these belong to you now.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.923
-Keys to the proverbial kingdom.
-Thanks.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.259
One night we'll all grab dinner
in the city.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.844
You, me, Bryan.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.679
Sounds like you're already planning
an escape.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.014
Good luck.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.910
<i>Sayonara,</i> Key House.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.166
Were you just flipping off the house?

23:39.167 --> 23:41.753
Uh... No, I was saying goodbye.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.466
There's more than one meaning
to the middle finger.

23:46.883 --> 23:47.717
Like <i>aloha?</i>

23:47.801 --> 23:48.635
Yeah.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
Yeah, like <i>aloha.</i>

23:50.929 --> 23:51.763
<i>Aloha!</i>

23:52.389 --> 23:55.100
See you, bud!

24:12.951 --> 24:13.869
Bye!

24:14.202 --> 24:15.328
Here we go.

24:25.046 --> 24:25.964
See you at lunch?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.091
I've got hockey tryouts.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.438
So, Angelica's coming
to Javi's party, Emma,

24:41.521 --> 24:44.107
other Emma, Logan,

24:44.316 --> 24:45.901
-Peter.
-You should invite the Locke girl.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.737
I know, but come on,
she's probably a real killjoy.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.406
Can't exactly blame her.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.533
It's really not that big of a deal.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.784
I mean, my aunt died last year

24:54.868 --> 24:56.703
and I didn't get any special treatment.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.874
Okay, but your aunt didn't die like that.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.000
And your point is?

25:20.977 --> 25:21.811
Ah, yes!

25:22.437 --> 25:23.438
Hey, how's it going?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.982
You mind if I sit, Rocky Road?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.527
-Excuse me?
-Rocky Road!

25:28.944 --> 25:30.654
It's a <i>"Nom De Guerre."</i>

25:31.279 --> 25:34.407
You know, it's both the ice cream
you ordered yesterday and...

25:35.408 --> 25:36.368
well, your life?

25:37.953 --> 25:38.870
Rocky road.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.247
I ordered mint chip.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.499
But imagine if you didn't.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.167
Look, if this is your spot,

25:44.292 --> 25:45.627
-I'll move.
-No, no, no, no, no!

25:45.710 --> 25:47.879
I've been looking for you,
like, everywhere.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.256
That came out wrong.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.133
What I meant to say was,
when I saw you yesterday, I thought,

25:52.884 --> 25:54.844
"Man, now that girl's weird."

25:54.928 --> 25:56.054
Hmm?

25:56.137 --> 25:57.389
No, look, I thought,

25:57.472 --> 26:00.600
"Now here's a girl who is clearly
trying to play down how cool she is,

26:00.684 --> 26:02.602
just sitting under the stairs
eating her bologna."

26:03.436 --> 26:05.438
Okay, first of all,
it's pronounced baloney.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.733
Second, this is fologna, I'm vegetarian.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.361
And third?
I like my fologna just fine, thanks.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.697
Mm...
Fologna doesn't even like itself.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.243
It's a self loathing substitute lunch meat
for a self loathing lunch meat.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.536
It tastes like boredom.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.454
And you, Kinsey Locke,

26:21.621 --> 26:23.290
are not boring.

26:26.793 --> 26:27.627
Scot Cavendish.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.924
So,

26:33.008 --> 26:34.968
me and my <i>droogs</i>

26:35.218 --> 26:36.720
are having a thing later.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.138
You should come.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.431
You have friends?

26:39.556 --> 26:40.849
More than one, in fact.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.475
Call ourselves the Savini Squad.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.811
You said your last name was Cavendish.

26:44.894 --> 26:46.438
Well, I did, and it is.

26:46.521 --> 26:49.566
But it'd be pretty lame
to name a squad after myself,

26:49.649 --> 26:50.609
wouldn't it?

26:50.734 --> 26:51.568
No, Savini.

26:52.027 --> 26:52.902
Tom Savini.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.155
You know, the Godfather of Gore?

26:56.781 --> 27:00.410
The man who put the word artist
in special effects and make-up artist?

27:02.495 --> 27:03.371
<i>Dawn of the Dead?</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:05.081
<i>Creepshow? Friday the 13th?</i>

27:05.165 --> 27:06.958
Are those movies or something?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.711
Wait, are you messing with me?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.469
Come play with us, Rocky Road.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.096
Thanks, but no.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.641
So, what, you're just gonna sit
under the stairs all year round?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.727
Mm-hmm. I have 118 fologna sandwiches
until the end of the year.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.396
-Mm.
-I'll be here every day counting down.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.440
Well, that sounds bloody awful.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.400
So, how about I ping you the address

27:32.525 --> 27:36.529
and when you're ready
for a dollop of sriracha, we'll be here.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.632

in Seattle.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.759
You don't have to play center
to get laid here.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.469

28:54.733 --> 28:57.444

Bode! Hey, Bode.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.635
I'm going to the hardware store

29:22.802 --> 29:23.636
No, not really.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.431
Well, text me on the iPad
if you need something.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.390
Okay.

Echo?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.823
I'm here, Bode.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.450
Who are you?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.952
I'm an echo.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.787
Your echo.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.330
You woke me up.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.791
Why are you down there?

31:18.167 --> 31:20.920
Echoes can come to life
in this place.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.631
No way.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.800
Have you found any keys yet?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.468
What keys?

31:27.552 --> 31:31.180
Your house is filled with amazing keys.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.515
There's a key that can let you

31:32.599 --> 31:35.143
step outside your body and be a ghost.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.185
Whoa...

31:36.311 --> 31:39.272
And another that can change
the way you look.

31:39.355 --> 31:43.401
The best is the key that can take you
anywhere in the world

31:43.484 --> 31:45.236
you wanna go if you know how to use it.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.321
Whoa.

31:46.446 --> 31:50.116
It's made of gold
and has six interlinked circles.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.285
Where can I find them?

31:52.368 --> 31:54.078
You listen for them.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.289
They whisper, Bode.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.000
Have you heard any whispering
in Key House?

31:59.792 --> 32:01.252
Yes...

32:01.336 --> 32:04.756
They'll only call to people
who are very special.

32:05.173 --> 32:06.299
Like you,

32:06.382 --> 32:08.384
-Bode.
- Bode!

32:08.801 --> 32:10.011
Gotta go.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.347
Better not tell anyone
about visiting your echo

32:12.430 --> 32:13.556
in the well house.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.099
They might worry.

32:15.934 --> 32:16.809
Okay.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.776
Oh, my gosh, Kins, the most amazing thing
just happened to me.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.612
I'll hear about it later.
This place is freezing.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.740
All I wanna do right now
is stand in a hot shower

32:30.823 --> 32:31.783
until my skin falls off.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.286
I wanna get some ice cream.

33:23.543 --> 33:24.502

-Your sister here?

35:16.155 --> 35:17.073
You broke my bracelet.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.492
No, I found this inside.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.329
Dad gave this to me.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.249
I promised I'd take care of it,
he trusted me with it.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.708
But it's a hidden magical key,

35:27.792 --> 35:29.127
it can take you anywhere!

35:29.252 --> 35:31.212
Enough of these stupid games, Bode!

35:31.295 --> 35:32.797

35:33.506 --> 35:34.423
The freezer.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.050
It's not pretend.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.552
Promise!

35:38.094 --> 35:39.679
Take me to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.028
Eiffel Tower.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.036
-What?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.539
Why didn't it work?

36:07.123 --> 36:08.708
Because you're delusional.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.754
-Hey!
-Get outta my room!

36:59.383 --> 37:00.218
Mom,

37:00.301 --> 37:01.385
Bode broke my bracelet!

37:01.636 --> 37:03.512
Can you tell him
to stay the hell out of my room?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.723
Yeah, sure.

37:05.848 --> 37:06.849
I'm sorry.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.434
What's that?

37:09.143 --> 37:12.271
I found a box of your father's things
in the attic.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.397
Look at this.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.984
It's a picture of him

37:17.735 --> 37:20.279
and, I think, his high school friends?

37:21.030 --> 37:22.782
Wow. Look at Dad.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.620
Where's Tyler?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.873
Hanging with his hockey bros.

37:31.123 --> 37:33.376
I'm glad he's making friends.

37:36.879 --> 37:37.838
Looks like you both are.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.300
Why are we even here?

37:42.760 --> 37:44.971
Away from everything and everyone we know?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.764
Dad never even wanted us to come here.

37:46.847 --> 37:47.932
We needed a fresh start

37:48.015 --> 37:49.976
and we were never gonna get it back there.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.852
Okay, you know what?
It's no different here.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.688
People still stare whenever they see us.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.690
But it's gonna get better, I promise.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.442
Okay.

38:01.821 --> 38:02.655
What?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.285
Dad never did bullshit platitudes.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.038
Hmm.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.165
-I'm coming back!

38:54.915 --> 38:56.959
Did you find any keys?

38:57.043 --> 38:59.211
I found that anywhere key
you told me about.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.547
But it only worked for me, not Kinsey.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.841
She couldn't go to the Eiffel Tower.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.677
Have you ever seen a door

39:06.761 --> 39:08.304
-at the Eiffel Tower?
-No.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.222
To travel through a door,

39:10.306 --> 39:11.766
you have to have seen it.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.393
Makes sense, I suppose.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.773
You know a lot of stuff about me,
but I don't know anything about you.

39:18.898 --> 39:20.816
Well, we're friends, Bode.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.444
So I can tell you anything
you wanna know.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.696
How do you live down there?

39:25.821 --> 39:27.239
I already told you.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.491
Magic.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.451
Don't you get hungry?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.912
Yes, I can get hungry.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.874
I get so hungry sometimes.

39:37.124 --> 39:38.959
Well, I could bring you some Doritos.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.045
Doritos are important in my world.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.338
I would like that a lot.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.840
I found another key.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.385
It has two faces and a mirror on it.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.303
What does it do?

39:54.433 --> 39:57.728
If you could have one wish
in the entire world, Bode,

39:58.396 --> 39:59.271
what would it be?

40:00.648 --> 40:02.817
I wish I could talk to my dad again.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.027
-He died.
-Oh.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.947
I'm so sorry.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.533
But you're in luck.

40:11.617 --> 40:12.868
That key you found?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.329
The one with the mirror?

40:17.039 --> 40:18.999
It'll let you see people who have died.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.377
That's impossible.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.838
Death is not as final as you think.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.508
Your whole family can see your dad again.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.303
Show it to your mom.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.702
They stay quiet

44:24.620 --> 44:26.538

They don't even know

44:30.542 --> 44:33.128

48:34.828 --> 48:35.746

48:35.829 --> 48:38.332

It's a fine place to trap your enemies.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.381
Yup. And that part is true.

48:47.132 --> 48:49.801

because it's very hard to get out.

-I'll show you! Come on!

-Keep going!

51:00.223 --> 51:01.058
Pull us out!

51:05.228 --> 51:06.646
- Whoa!

51:09.441 --> 51:10.776
Are you all right?

51:17.199 --> 51:19.159
-What the hell just happened?
- I told you,

51:19.242 --> 51:21.119
these keys are for real business.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.455
This is... what is this?

51:24.539 --> 51:26.541
This house is full of magical keys.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.839
-Mom?

51:36.218 --> 51:37.135
Are you okay?

51:38.136 --> 51:40.055
Fine. Fine!

51:44.351 --> 51:46.269
Did you have fun at your party?

51:48.897 --> 51:49.981
The mirror?

51:54.194 --> 51:55.654
It's nice, right?

51:55.904 --> 51:59.199
Uh... It could use some polishing.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.536
Mom!

52:02.661 --> 52:05.580
You went through the mirror in there!
And then you got lost inside!

52:08.416 --> 52:09.417
He's not lying.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.378
You were just in there.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.879
What are we talking about?

52:15.006 --> 52:15.841
The mirror.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.260
Oh, right.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.762
We can get you one for your room, too.

52:21.346 --> 52:22.681
I'll add it to the list.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.902
What is this place?

52:43.243 --> 52:44.786
-Lesser?

52:46.454 --> 52:47.414
You got a visitor.

53:19.154 --> 53:20.238
Hi, Sam.

53:22.365 --> 53:24.159
I told you I'd come see you.
