00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Hey!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hey!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Watch where
you're walking, nigga.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
H-hey, what you say, nigga?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
: Watch closely.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
You're about to experience a "Nigga Moment."

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Webster defines the "Nigga Moment"

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
of an otherwise logical Negro male--

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
What did you say,
bitch nigga?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hey, squeeze it, nigga!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
--causing him to act in an illogical,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
self-destructive manner, i.e., like a nigga.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
You want it?
Right here.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Nigga Moments are unpredictable.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Hey, wait, man. Wait.
This is stupid.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Hey, you right, dawg.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Look, let's put the guns away
and go on about our business.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
MAN: Freeze!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
HUEY: But they all end up bad.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
If they had their own category, Nigga Moments

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
would be the third leading killer of black men

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
behind pork chops and FEMA.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
It's a fact.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Now, let's see how a Nigga Moment

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
affects a white man.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Prick.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Watch where you walkin', bitch.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
What did you--?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Wait a minute.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm white.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Where you goin'?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Don't you ignore me.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
This is a perfectly
good moment

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
to throw your life away.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
A big misconception about the Nigga Moment

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
is that it can be avoided

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
by simply moving away from niggas.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
If only it were that easy.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
See, niggas always got a new trick

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
right around the corner.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Listen up, boys.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm about to sing
the "New Shoes" song.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Boy, Nike makes some good shoes.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Hoo!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
MAN:

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
MAN:
Oh!

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
GRANDDAD:
What the hell?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Hey! What's goin' on, man?
Damn!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I know there's nobody
in my space.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
This is handicapped parking.
Isn't it?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
GRANDDAD:
Don't do that, don't do that!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
HUEY:
Yo, man, watch

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
where you're going.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Stupid son of a bitch!

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
HUEY: Every Nigga Moment begins

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
with the nigga.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Without that key element,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
all you're left with is peace and quiet.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Colonel H. Stinkmeaner is, and always has been,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
a cantankerous, ornery old man.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
He spent his childhood disagreeing with most things,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
especially things involving happiness,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
unity and kindness.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Stinkmeaner got no pleasure seeing sunsets and trees,

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
dolphins or rainbows.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Man, this some old bullshit.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
So he didn't particularly mind

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
when at age 15, he lost his sight to cancer.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
At least I don't have to look
at your ugly ass no more.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
The doctors gave him three years to live.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So he dedicated those three years

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
to spreading a lifetime of misery and hatred.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
You danged fool!

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Nobody knows how Stinkmeaner managed to live so long.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
He believed it was his love of hatred that kept him going.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Who in the hell parked
in my space?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That's like calling
1-800-Collect-An-Ass-Whupping.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
And no, that ain't
no toll-free call, partner.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
GRANDDAD:
You hit my car!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Are you blind?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Yes, I am! So?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Wait. You're blind?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Blind!

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You got a problem
with that, ni-yagga?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
You could have killed somebody.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I-I'd be doing them a favor.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Getting run over by me

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
is as close
to an honorable death

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
as most of these people
are gonna get.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Some days,
I'm quite the humanitarian.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
I think I hit a wheelchair
on the way over here. Heh.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh, look what you did
to Dorothy.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
You'd better have insurance.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Ni-yagga,
you better have insurance!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Ass-whupping insurance.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And you about to pay
a deductible.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
HUEY: And just like that,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
my granddad was trapped in a Nigga Moment.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
At this point, he can:

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Let's see which one he chooses.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
That's right.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I backed into your car,
ni-yagga.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What you gonna do?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
What you gonna do?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
RILEY:
Oh, hell nah.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Granddad, let's whup
this nigga's ass right now.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Bitch-ass, faggot-ass,

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
punk-ass, pussy-ass,
bitch-ass nigga.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Do you wanna do something,

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
bitch-ass ni-yagga?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Hold up.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I smell new shoes.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
RILEY:
Awe, man.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh! Not the shoes!

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Fool, what you--
Hey!

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
HUEY: I've said it before.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Expensive sneakers are like $150 land mines.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Step on one and boom!

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
A perfectly rational black man can explode.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah!

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
They ain't new anymore
are they, ni-yagga?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
RILEY:
And that nigga's

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
spittin' on you.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
You better hit him,
Granddad.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Hit him. Hit him! Yeah!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
RILEY: Hit him!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh!

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
GRANDDAD: Uh-oh.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Yeah!
My bad knee!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, Lordy-Lordy-Lord.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
RILEY: What you doing, man?
My bad knee.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
RILEY:
Oh, man.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
MAN: Huh?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
RILEY:
You lose all your pimp status.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
This fight is over.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
GRANDDAD:
I hate this damn song.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I can't believe you got

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
your ass kicked
by a blind man, Granddad.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
My knee went out.
You know I got a bad knee.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Bad knee?
That nigga had bad eyes.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
He couldn't see, Granddad.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
He beat you like a piñata.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Nah.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Yo, we can rent Granddad out
for Mexican birthday parties.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
We can call him
Señor Piñata.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Hola,  Señor Piñata.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Stop it, boy!
Stop it.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Where's my belt?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
RILEY:
Whoo. Whoo.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I must be blind too,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
'cause I sure didn't see
that ass-whupping coming.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Boy.
Riley.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
Yo, how bad you gotta
telegraph your punches

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
for a blind nigga

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
to see 'em coming,
Granddad?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Riley, the man had
a heightened sense of hearing.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh, I thought Granddad had
a heightened sense of falling.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Now, that's enough.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Now, you just stop laughing
at your granddaddy.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What's wrong with you?
Granddad had "hit me"

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
written on his forehead
in Braille.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I said, that's enough!

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Okay. What you gonna do?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Beat me?

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Maybe I should get
a blindfold first.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, I'm ready.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Wait.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Maybe he gonna fall on me.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
HUEY:
Riley, stop.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Granddad...
Rodney King just called,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and said...

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
"Damn, I thought
I got my ass whupped!"

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Ow!

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
HUEY: That night, I dreamt

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
of a blind swordsman.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
HUEY: He knows my every move,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
yet, he cannot see.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
As my mind fights to make sense of the impossible,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
he has turned my sight into a liability.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
HUEY: He has no just cause

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
to want my life.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
There is no forethought, no logic in his actions.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
This isn't just any swordsman.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
This is the Blind Nigga Samurai.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
What's good, nigga?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
What's really good?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Niggas.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
A Nigga Moment isn't necessarily over

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
when you think it's over.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
It kind of hangs around like a unpaid bill.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
: And in a case of the blind

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
beating the dumb,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
security cameras from the Woodcrest Square Mall

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
captured a fight between a blind old man

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
and an unidentified assailant following a parking dispute.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Aw...

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Man.
It's just local news.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
MAN 2: CNN has now confirmed

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
that it was this man,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Robert Jebediah Freeman,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
who got beat up by a slightly older,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
significantly blinder gentleman.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Police aren't pressing charges against Mr. Freeman.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
They say that ass-whupping was punishment enough.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
We at CNN agree.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Granddad,
I don't think

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
you should watch
this anymore.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
El residente de Woodcrest, Robert Freeman,

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
tiene un nuevo apodo:
Señor Piñata.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
: Oh, Patty.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Granddad,
you gotta ask yourself,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
would you really
be better off

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
if you had beaten up
a blind old man in the street?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It was a Nigga Moment,
Granddad.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
You gotta let it go.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Maybe you're right.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You have reached the Freeman residence.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
If this is a lovely cutie-pie,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
please leave a message.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Everybody else should just hang up right now,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
because I'm not interested.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
RUCKUS: Come on, Robert.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Pick up the phone.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Pick up the phone. I know you there in hiding.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I seen you on the news getting your black ass whupped

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
by that blind, old monkey.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That's why they shouldn't let niggas go shopping.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Call me back.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Don't you walk away from this answering machine.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Granddad,
just let it die.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I promise you,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
nobody's gonna call you
a punk.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
RILEY:
I will.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Well, Riley will.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Granddad.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
I can't believe Granddad went
back to fight that man.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
RILEY:
Yo!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Check this out, Huey.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
RILEY:
All right, all right.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Wait. Wait, wait.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Watch. Watch, watch.
W-watch this.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Here it comes.
Here it comes. Oh!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Eat this right here!

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That song's shit.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
RILEY:
Hey, you ever notice

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
whenever someone throws
a chair,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
a brawl jumps off?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Aren't you worried
about Granddad?

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Look, you wanna
see it again?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Hey, look. Look.
L-look, look, see?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I think you don't
even have

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
to hit nobody
with a chair.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And niggas will still
start wilin' out.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, you don't
look hurt.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Two weeks.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Good for you.
A rematch in two weeks.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
This'll be great.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Hey, we might be able
to make some money off this.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
"The Slugfest
in Woodcrest." Yeah.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
You don't understand, boy.
I have to do this.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Follow me.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I want you to see
what you're up against.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Holy shit.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
You remember the way
he dodged your punch?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Your enemy is the Zatoichi.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
The Blind Swordsman.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
His ears give him
more information

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
than all your senses
put together.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
If you underestimate him,
he will kill you.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Ah!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
You must train.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I won't fail you.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm not afraid.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh, you will be.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
You will be.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
GRANDDAD:
And a one, two...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And a three...
Wa-ta!

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Ah. Between me
and you,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
your granddad shouldn't
be too worried.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Everybody knows
niggas can't fight.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm sorry?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You heard me, nigga.
Niggas can't fight.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
They don't possess
the strength of character

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
or the mental quickness
to be a great fighter.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
That's why all the best
fighters in the world

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
have always been white men.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Jack Dempsey,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Rocky Marciano,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
"Slyvester" Stallone.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And don't forget
Ralph Macchio.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You name me one great
black heavyweight fighter.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Name one. Go ahead.
Try and name one.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
See that?
You can't do it.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
What?
What, what, what?

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Oh, oh, oh. You wanna pull Ali
out your ass?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
That what you
thinking about?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Muhammad Ali?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, if that nigga's
so tough,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
then why he didn't
go to Vietnam?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I'll tell you why.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
'Cause he was scared.
That's why.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Shoot. "No Vietnamese
ever called me nigga."

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I call him a nigga
eight times

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
before I have breakfast.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
Now, what he gonna do?
Hold on, I'll make it nine.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Nigga!

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I don't understand
why I'm blindfolded.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
HUEY:
Because the enemy

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
cannot see.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But, see, the thing is,

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I don't have super hearing,
so I don't get why I'm--

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
HUEY: Fight!

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Ow!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Stop!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Jean-Claude Van Damme

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
is the best martial artist
in the world.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
He killed a man
with his butt cheek power.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Steven Seagal, David Carradine,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Chuck Norris.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Shoot.  Walker, Texas Ranger?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Now, that's a karate man
right there.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
HUEY: Word got out that my granddad

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
was training for a rematch,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
and it quickly became the talk of the town.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
What was that?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
An exhibition?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
You need emotional content.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Now, try again.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Oooooh-ah-da!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Damn! That hurt.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn it, boy!

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Hoo. Haa.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Ooh.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Everybody knows niggas
climb trees, not kick 'em.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
HUEY: Riley had the brilliant idea

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
to take advance orders for the DVD release of the fight,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and take a little action on the side.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GRANDDAD:
Ugh! Pain.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
He hired a street team to create the necessary hype.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
HUEY: The fight had a huge turnout.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
MAN:
Come on...

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Seems like watching niggas act stupid

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
was becoming America's favorite pastime.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Hey, listen up!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'm gonna tell y'all
one more time.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
This fight ain't startin'
till I get $10 from all y'all.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Hey. You. Nah, nigga,
I didn't get yours yet.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Give me that.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
That's the difference between private Nigga Moments

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
and public Nigga Moments.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
A private Nigga Moment shames  you.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
A public Nigga Moment shames the whole race.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Ooh, this is it.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I'm gonna kick
some ass now.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Granddad, the only way to win
is not to fight.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
That's right, Robert.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Nobody's gonna call you
a fruity boy

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
or a pansy pants
if you don't do this.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
RILEY:
I will.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Right.
Well, Riley will.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
MAN:
I mean, everybody's

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
real focused so far.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
MAN 2:
Here we go.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
You scared?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah. You scared,
ain't ya, bitch nigga?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I can smell
the bitch in ya.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Hm, hm, mm...

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Ooh, that's
vintage bitch.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
You must have
Alzheimer's, old man.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
You already forgot
that ass-whupping?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Uh-oh. Huh-huh.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, I hear ya coming.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
HUEY: And as I watched Stinkmeaner

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
move blindly around the ring,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I had a terrifying realization.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
He wasn't a trained swordsman,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
and he didn't have super hearing.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
He was a blind, old man who had just gotten lucky.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
Granddad! Wait!
No, stop!

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
RILEY:
Come on, Granddad.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm gonna
keep comin' anyway!

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
MAN:
Damn! Kick him

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
in the nut.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
You know, we could all be reading a book right now.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
MAN 3:
He got what

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
he deserved, man.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
MAN:
Come on, now.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Wait a minute.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
MAN 2:
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I can't believe it.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
RILEY:
Dang, Granddad!

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
You didn't have to kill him.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
HUEY: And so, Granddad emerged

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
from the Nigga Moment victorious.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Congratulations,
Robert.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
I told you a nigga
that black couldn't fight.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Whew! Good goin'.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
MAN 4:
Hey, that wasn't worth it, man.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I had my fingers crossed.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
MAN 5:
I want my money.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
MAN 6:
You owe me money, man.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Gimme my money back!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
I want my money now.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Gimme my damn money, kid.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
WOMAN:
Oh, my God, a chair!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
MAN 7:
Hey, what does he think--?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
MAN:
I'm mad, man!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Niggas.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
HUEY: As he contemplated

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
spending the remainder

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
of his natural life in prison,

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Granddad never stopped to realize

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
that he had gotten the respect he so desperately wanted.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
Yo, that mug killed a blind,
old man with his bare hands.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Now, that's
gangsta.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Robert Jebediah
Freeman?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Tom and I had gotten the fight licensed

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
by the state boxing commission at the last minute,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
legally indemnifying Granddad against Stinkmeaner's death.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
But he was still pretty shook up by the whole thing.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
Colonel Stinkmeaner had no family and no friends.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
He lived a life without love or companionship,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
or even pets.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
He was a horrible, awful human being.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
And in truth, the world was better off with him dead.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Still, he was our brother.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Lord, please forgive us
for taking this man's life.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Why you say "us"?
You killed him--

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Shut your ass and pray, boy.
