NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:12.292 --> 01:13.708
<i>...very warm in France today.</i>

01:13.792 --> 01:18.250
<i>Will June 2018 top June 2017's</i>
<i>record-breaking temperatures,</i>

01:18.333 --> 01:22.792
<i>already the second hottest month</i>
<i>on record?</i>

01:25.083 --> 01:27.875
<i>Thunderstorm activity is set to continue</i>
<i>over much of France. </i>

01:27.958 --> 01:32.417
<i>No less than 31 regions have been issued</i>
<i>with a severe weather warning,</i>

01:32.500 --> 01:35.167
<i>from the Pyrenees to the Massif Central,</i>

01:35.250 --> 01:39.125
<i>and the central regions,</i>
<i>Upper Normandy and Picardy.</i>

02:11.667 --> 02:12.667
Noumouké.

02:19.792 --> 02:20.625
Noumouké!

02:21.208 --> 02:22.083
Wake up.

02:22.167 --> 02:25.375
Wake up, Noumouké. It's time.
You're gonna be late. Wake up!

02:25.458 --> 02:27.792
-I'm dreaming.
-I'm not going to repeat myself!

02:30.083 --> 02:31.208
Look at your room!

02:35.167 --> 02:39.375
I'm going out. I want you up and dressed
by the time I do.

02:40.375 --> 02:42.542
Otherwise... You have five minutes!

03:01.042 --> 03:01.958
Good morning.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.917
Good morning, Mr. Mirabeau.

03:08.208 --> 03:11.375
Mom, leave that. Let me. I'll do it.

03:13.792 --> 03:14.750
My son...

03:15.583 --> 03:18.375
-It's gonna be all right. <i>Inch'Allah.</i>
-Okay.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.750
Please wake your brother.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.667
-Okay. Have a good day, Mom.
-Thanks, you too.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.583
-You have five minutes.
-Leave me alone.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.042
No. Get in the back.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.125
Need a lift?

05:10.208 --> 05:11.292
No, I'm okay.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.000
Can I drive, please?

05:26.625 --> 05:27.500
So?

05:28.292 --> 05:31.000
Hey. Stop looking at him, you idiots.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.500
I don't give a fuck
about Noumouké and his brother.

05:33.583 --> 05:37.000
He's no big deal.
My uncle's got a ride like that, too.

05:39.583 --> 05:40.708
So?

05:41.083 --> 05:42.208
You brake too hard.

05:43.417 --> 05:44.792
What do you want?

05:44.875 --> 05:46.167
Nothing, sir.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.458
-You're a Fitoussi, aren't you?
-Yes.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.708
You look exactly like Fawziyah.

05:50.792 --> 05:52.750
-That your mom?
-No, I'm her niece

05:52.833 --> 05:53.667
Lamia's daughter?

05:53.750 --> 05:55.375
No, I'm her niece.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.250
-Samia's?
-No, her niece.

05:57.917 --> 05:58.833
Never mind.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.417
What are you laughing at?

06:01.375 --> 06:03.917
-You're Hakima's daughter.
-Yes, sir, exactly.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.708
Why are you calling me "sir"?

06:07.083 --> 06:09.167
-Yes, Demba.
-Who told you to call me Demba?

06:09.250 --> 06:10.167
I'm not your friend.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.125
He's just messing with you.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.250
Here you go.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.708
Share it with your friend.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.667
What's up? You're looking good.

06:35.417 --> 06:36.500
Seven years.

06:37.042 --> 06:39.042
If I'd been busted
for everything I'd done,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.125
I'd have come out in a box.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.583
Sonia told me about your warrants.

06:46.958 --> 06:50.042
The first time I made big money
was with you. I won't forget.

07:01.042 --> 07:02.542
I quit eight months ago.

07:03.208 --> 07:04.417
Congrats.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.625
What are you going to do now?

07:06.708 --> 07:08.083
Someone I know from Marseille

07:08.167 --> 07:11.042
is bringing in 100 kilograms of cocaine
next week.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.833
Does that answer your question?

07:15.583 --> 07:16.500
You in?

07:16.917 --> 07:18.708
I go to the source now, Abdel.

07:19.708 --> 07:21.667
But if I need something, I'll ask you.

07:28.792 --> 07:29.625
What's that?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.500
I'm not here to beg.

07:37.292 --> 07:38.708
There's 10,000 euros.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.667
Well, if you insist.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.833
Any news of Francis?

07:52.750 --> 07:55.375
If he didn't snitch,
the cops would have nothing on us.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.042
You'll never hear of him again.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.875
You never taken someone down?

08:04.208 --> 08:06.958
They say the first time's the hardest,
because...

08:07.042 --> 08:08.167
you have no choice.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.625
But I say it's the second time...

08:10.708 --> 08:13.042
because you realize you have it in you.

08:17.042 --> 08:20.292
I want to warn you...
Sahli's about to arrive.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.417
Then I'll go.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.000
Nice seeing you, Abdel.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.000
Let him in.

08:57.958 --> 08:58.792
Go ahead.

09:08.083 --> 09:12.750
-Where do you think you're going?
-Go on, let him in.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.042
-What are you after?
-A block.

09:22.125 --> 09:22.958
-A block?
-Yeah.

09:23.042 --> 09:23.875
Fine.

09:50.042 --> 09:52.458
That teacher's breath stinks!

09:52.542 --> 09:54.333
He was nice, you mean.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.750
Like he had roadkill in his mouth!

09:57.708 --> 10:02.208
He kept getting real close
to give me advice during class.

10:02.292 --> 10:06.417
Yeah, but when he came near me,
I went straight into scuba diving mode.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.250
Yo, that stinks!

10:08.833 --> 10:11.042
-Beat it!
-I'm gonna tell.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.042
Right. Have you thought about it?

10:27.042 --> 10:28.125
Yeah. No way.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.458
You scared?

10:29.542 --> 10:32.458
What are you talking about?
How are you gonna get in, anyway?

10:32.542 --> 10:35.500
Kick the door down.
You think I'm gonna ask for their keys?

10:35.583 --> 10:39.042
Drop it. If we get busted, it'll cause
problems between my brother and Sahli.

10:39.125 --> 10:43.083
We won't! Anyway, your bro Demba
will kick Sahli's ass.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.958
You wanna stay here all summer?

10:45.042 --> 10:47.333
I'm not rotting here. We gotta get away.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.333
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.375
Please, take a seat.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.958
It is with great pleasure
that I welcome you to this chamber.

11:06.042 --> 11:09.708
It has a very special resonance
for us lawyers.

11:09.792 --> 11:14.167
Here, you'll defend, accuse,
try to convince.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.583
As per the rule,

11:16.667 --> 11:20.583
I will now reveal the topic of the debate

11:21.250 --> 11:24.917
for the oratory competition final.

11:27.500 --> 11:31.250
Is the State solely responsible

11:31.333 --> 11:35.667
for the current situation
of the suburbs in France?

11:36.917 --> 11:40.167
You'll defend the affirmative,
Ms. Crèvecœur.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.417
Throwing light on the responsibility
of the State

11:44.500 --> 11:46.292
in the situation of the suburbs.

11:46.375 --> 11:47.292
Thank you, sir.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.417
And therefore, Mr. Traoré,
you'll defend the negative.

11:52.542 --> 11:55.292
-Thank you.
-Being convinced won't be enough.

11:55.375 --> 11:58.292
You need to be convincing and eloquent.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.333
You'll be judged on these two criteria.

12:02.792 --> 12:04.583
I'll leave you to look around.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.375
See you in two weeks.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.292
Thank you, sir.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.833
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.250
Be imposing to not have to impose.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.000
Exactly.

12:20.167 --> 12:21.708
Have you seen him defend?

12:21.792 --> 12:23.042
No, never.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.292
You should. You learn a lot.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.250
Undoubtedly.

12:28.042 --> 12:29.708
What do you think of the topic?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.208
Inspiring.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.250
I have lots to say.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.750
You don't mind defending the State?

12:39.292 --> 12:42.417
Because I grew up in the suburbs,
I should be against the State?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.750
A bit cliché, I admit.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.625
For you, the State is responsible
for all the problems in the suburbs?

12:48.708 --> 12:49.792
Indeed, sir.

12:50.292 --> 12:51.625
Make your case, ma'am.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.750
-What, now?
-Yes.

12:59.042 --> 13:00.208
The prosecutor!

13:02.750 --> 13:06.000
The question, sir, is who is the State?

13:07.292 --> 13:09.458
The State is not the people.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.208
The State is those who govern us.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.417
More often than not, white and wealthy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.167
Those who govern us,

13:18.250 --> 13:22.000
whose disastrous policies
towards people living in the suburbs

13:22.083 --> 13:25.125
and taunting words

13:25.208 --> 13:27.917
have split France in two.

13:32.958 --> 13:34.083
The defense!

13:35.875 --> 13:39.708
You tell us the State
is those who govern us.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.875
But those who govern...

13:43.542 --> 13:47.375
were elected by those governed...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.917
or by the absence of their vote.

13:50.875 --> 13:53.042
If the former are responsible,

13:53.583 --> 13:56.000
how are the latter exempted?

13:56.083 --> 13:56.958
Excuse me.

13:57.792 --> 13:59.333
The hearings will resume.

13:59.417 --> 14:00.292
Thank you.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.958
Save some energy for the final.
You'll need it.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.125
Speak for yourself.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.458
-Presumptuous.
-Realistic.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.667
When was
the International Criminal Court created?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.000
In 1998.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.083
No, in 2002.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.167
The Rome Statute of ICC was adopted on--

14:16.250 --> 14:18.083
On July 17, 1998,

14:18.167 --> 14:20.625
but entered into force in 2002,
when ratified.

14:20.708 --> 14:21.625
Exactly.

14:24.792 --> 14:29.208
The problem is that since its creation,
the ICC only initiated proceedings

14:29.292 --> 14:31.042
against African leaders,

14:31.125 --> 14:33.542
thus discrediting itself completely.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.042
Hey! Watch it!

14:59.417 --> 15:01.167
Not your cellphone, your book!

15:01.250 --> 15:03.917
Keep going.
I have to tend to the kids, okay?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.167
I don't believe this!

15:07.250 --> 15:09.708
It's not my fault.
I waited 40 minutes for the train.

15:09.792 --> 15:12.583
-Of course, it's--
-The State's fault, exactly.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.083
I'm not joking, Soulaymaan.

15:14.167 --> 15:18.125
Honestly, I can't do it on my own.
It's the third time this month.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.625
-I'm here now. Smile.
-Hold your horses.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.542
Without other volunteers, we won't last.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.625
I want you to be on time, okay?
Take the French group.

15:25.708 --> 15:26.667
At your service.

15:28.042 --> 15:29.250
-Hello, kids.
-Hello.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.375
Hello. Soulaymaan, I have a problem.

15:32.458 --> 15:36.833
-My pencil doesn't work.
-I'll give you another one.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.042
Malak, why don't you take out your things?

15:40.083 --> 15:42.292
-What are you working on?
-Reading.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.333
Reading?

15:46.083 --> 15:49.833
You need to find the missing vowels
and write the words correctly.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.583
-What's a vowel?
-In second grade and you don't know?

15:53.083 --> 15:54.083
What's a vowel, kids?

15:54.167 --> 15:55.667
-Oh, I know!
-Fatou.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.417
A, E, I, O, U, Y.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.000
Hi, Mom.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.625
Let me help you.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.542
Leave me alone. You know me?

16:14.625 --> 16:15.792
Leave me alone.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.292
I told you to leave me alone.

16:20.083 --> 16:21.458
Out of my life!

16:21.542 --> 16:23.500
I don't want anything to do with you.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.333
That's all!

16:29.417 --> 16:30.583
It's good, Mom.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.458
-Do you know what time it is?
-Come on, it's barely 8.00 p.m.

16:44.542 --> 16:45.542
Watch your mouth!

16:46.042 --> 16:48.542
You have time to hang around
but not for homework?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.667
Wash your hands and come to eat.

17:14.708 --> 17:15.541
Where's my spoon?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.916
Go get it yourself.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.292
It's okay, Mom.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.250
Don't move. I'll do it myself.

17:33.667 --> 17:35.458
Yes. Thank you, son.

17:36.458 --> 17:40.292
You'll make your future wife very happy
if you take care of her like that.

17:41.042 --> 17:44.375
I'm not sure I could do it
for another woman.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.042
Nonsense.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.750
You're a gentleman,
you know how to talk to ladies.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.250
-Doesn't he, Noumouké?
-Yep.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.083
"Yep," and what about you?

17:54.167 --> 17:57.917
-What do you mean?
-You'll find a nice, pretty wife.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.583
To take care of your poor mother.

18:01.417 --> 18:02.375
Promise?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.125
Noumouké.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.750
Can you see the waitress?

18:18.250 --> 18:19.250
Rim, Aïcha!

18:19.333 --> 18:20.167
Thanks.

18:27.458 --> 18:29.833
I pistol whipped him,
he was pissing blood!

18:30.208 --> 18:33.667
-You're trigger happy. Be careful.
-I won't roll around at 35!

18:33.750 --> 18:36.583
You know what they say.
Since the Chinese invented gunpowder.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.667
-What the hell's he talking about?
-What's up? Majid. Demba.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.000
-How's it going?
-Good.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.333
Yo, Jason Statham.

18:43.417 --> 18:44.375
What's up, bro?

18:44.458 --> 18:48.000
Still the same:
money, sex, violence, <i>la vida loca.</i>

18:50.208 --> 18:54.042
-Let's grab something to eat.
-Nah, or I'll end up closing the shop.

18:54.125 --> 18:58.042
You know what? I've been seeing this girl.
She's about to fall into my trap.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.083
She'll get it.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.292
-How much did you make?
-6,500.

19:03.375 --> 19:04.750
-Nothing for me?
-Nope.

19:05.625 --> 19:09.417
Another client said Sahli's team
tried to keep him from scoring with us.

19:09.500 --> 19:13.875
-What's his problem? Let's kick his ass!
-Anytime now, I'll whoop him.

19:13.958 --> 19:15.917
Give the cash to Rim
and come back tomorrow.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.875
Got it. See you later, Samir.

19:21.958 --> 19:24.750
-I'm gonna go.
-All right. I'll call you tomorrow.

19:24.833 --> 19:26.708
-Take care, bro.
-You too.

19:45.833 --> 19:47.708
Don't worry. I've prepared a feast.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.167
You like fish?

19:51.042 --> 19:53.500
Okay then, let's go.

19:54.292 --> 19:55.458
See you.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.125
Samir's gonna score tonight!

20:12.208 --> 20:13.208
Get in!

20:14.417 --> 20:15.750
I missed him!

20:17.042 --> 20:19.667
They shot me in front of my own house!

20:19.750 --> 20:21.667
-My own house!
-Did you see him?

20:21.750 --> 20:23.208
The guy was hooded!

20:23.292 --> 20:24.167
So, it was Lakdar?

20:24.250 --> 20:27.500
I beat him up last week
and today I get shot. You think?

20:28.042 --> 20:31.333
I'm gonna get my AK
and set this fucking project on fire!

20:31.417 --> 20:34.625
-I'm gonna shoot those motherfuckers!
-Calm down.

20:34.708 --> 20:36.750
I can't! They tried to kill me!

20:36.833 --> 20:38.917
-Want jail time?
-I don't give a fuck!

20:39.000 --> 20:42.375
Between ten years and a bullet,
I'd take the ten years.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.833
Do what you want, but tomorrow
the cops are on your doorstep.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.333
So be it.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.458
Demba, if you're not in,
I won't be offended.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.042
But in this business,
you have to be ready to kill.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.833
Everyone else is.

20:54.917 --> 20:56.083
I said I'd come.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.750
-I don't know.
-Did I say that?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.042
-I'm starving.
-Go to McDonald's.

21:09.125 --> 21:09.958
What?

21:10.042 --> 21:12.917
I told you to eat here,
you chose McDonald's.

21:16.542 --> 21:20.208
If the inhabitants of the suburbs
consider the State responsible

21:20.292 --> 21:21.792
for all their problems,

21:21.875 --> 21:27.792
they would expect the State
to have all the solutions.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.375
But the State,

21:30.625 --> 21:32.167
so strong in your opinion,

21:33.167 --> 21:34.125
cannot,

21:35.292 --> 21:37.000
maybe doesn't want to...

21:37.667 --> 21:40.583
Either way,
will not provide these solutions.

21:40.667 --> 21:45.083
So, what's left except for...

21:46.708 --> 21:48.333
whining victimhood?

22:07.250 --> 22:08.167
May I?

22:13.167 --> 22:16.417
Here to bribe me to let you win?

22:16.500 --> 22:20.708
No, I suggest you abandon
before your grand defeat.

22:22.167 --> 22:26.333
As a woman, I banned the word "abandon"
a long time ago.

22:26.417 --> 22:28.708
As a black man from the suburbs, same.

22:28.792 --> 22:33.667
But if I considered the State
solely responsible for my troubles...

22:36.458 --> 22:38.875
-What are you doing?
-Give me a smile.

22:39.250 --> 22:42.292
A happy memory before you lose.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.542
-There, that's what I call a smile.
-Stop it.

22:47.833 --> 22:48.708
Can I see it?

22:53.917 --> 22:54.958
My expression!

22:56.458 --> 22:58.333
-Can I look at the rest?
-Sure.

23:03.250 --> 23:04.625
You've got the eye for it.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.500
I don't know, I just love it.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.250
I think I'll need your eye for something.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.542
Mom!

23:29.917 --> 23:32.875
My son! It's so kind of you.

23:33.625 --> 23:34.750
-How are you?
-Good.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.500
I like it when you come to pick me up.

23:38.458 --> 23:41.667
But don't you have a debate
to prepare for?

23:41.750 --> 23:44.208
Don't worry, Mom. I have ten days left.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.000
But I'm gonna win.

23:46.083 --> 23:47.083
<i>Inch'Allah.</i>

24:07.792 --> 24:09.792
-You doin' something?
-Nothin'.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.125
-Wanna play some ball?
-It's been a while.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.167
-You gonna stay?
-Yeah.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.250
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.250
Excuse me,
could you turn the music down, please?

24:20.333 --> 24:23.292
Who you talkin' to?
Shut the fuck up and drive your bus!

24:23.375 --> 24:25.708
-For the other passengers.
-Shut the fuck up!

24:25.792 --> 24:29.625
Motherfucker!
We chillin' and nobody complainin'.

24:29.708 --> 24:33.500
You talkin' shit.
Sit the fuck down and drive your bus!

24:33.583 --> 24:35.708
Don't even talk to him.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.917
-We gonna bust him up.
-Motherfucker.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.083
Thinks he's some kind of sheriff.

24:46.292 --> 24:49.458
Son! Please turn the music down.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.167
Behave yourself!

25:09.625 --> 25:11.083
Pass it over here!

25:11.167 --> 25:13.250
-Pass it to me!
-Go, go!

25:13.333 --> 25:14.792
Outta my way!

25:14.875 --> 25:16.458
Hey! Beat it!

25:17.333 --> 25:20.792
What do you want?
You want me to fuck you, or what?

25:20.875 --> 25:23.125
-Who do you think you are?
-You're dead, asshole!

25:23.208 --> 25:25.083
-Go on!
-Fuck him up, Noumouké!

25:32.208 --> 25:34.125
Fuck him up, Noumouké!

25:45.250 --> 25:46.833
-Stop it!
-I'll kill you!

25:46.917 --> 25:48.667
Let go!

25:48.750 --> 25:50.708
Beat it! Fuck!

25:50.792 --> 25:54.292
I'm gonna get you, Traoré,
and I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

26:03.875 --> 26:05.833
<i>...a turbulent week ahead.</i>

26:05.917 --> 26:09.000
<i>Truckers, pensioners,</i><i>and civil servants</i>
<i>are taking to the streets,</i>

26:09.083 --> 26:10.458
<i>with two large protests...</i>

26:13.625 --> 26:14.500
You okay, Mom?

26:18.458 --> 26:19.583
What's he done now?

26:20.292 --> 26:22.583
He said that he banged into a post.

26:23.250 --> 26:26.792
And I get a call from the school.
They want to see me.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.458
I'm so ashamed, Noumouké!

26:30.875 --> 26:31.958
Proud of yourself?

26:33.750 --> 26:35.375
I'll go talk to the principal.

26:35.458 --> 26:38.875
For them to say
that I don't take care of my kids?

26:38.958 --> 26:40.042
No, Soulaymaan!

26:41.208 --> 26:42.042
No.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.125
We'll go together, then.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
All right.

26:59.667 --> 27:00.500
Traoré...

27:01.292 --> 27:02.292
Pray for us.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.625
May the Lord give me strength.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.750
I do everything I can to educate him.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.042
I don't doubt it, Ms. Traoré.

27:22.250 --> 27:25.333
Never had a problem with this one.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.208
Never called in. But him...

27:29.708 --> 27:33.333
He's on the same path as his brother.
I don't know what to do.

27:33.417 --> 27:34.417
Please, sir,

27:34.958 --> 27:36.833
at least let him finish the year.

27:36.917 --> 27:38.667
I understand your distress,

27:38.750 --> 27:42.375
but he got into a fight with a student
and punched a teacher.

27:50.250 --> 27:51.667
Like I did it on purpose.

27:52.792 --> 27:55.792
You're so stupid! Kicked out
two weeks before your exams!

27:55.875 --> 27:57.958
-Are you dumb or what?
-Leave me alone!

27:58.042 --> 27:58.917
Leave me alone?!

27:59.500 --> 28:00.833
What's wrong with you?

28:04.042 --> 28:05.583
You're gonna kill me.

28:05.667 --> 28:06.750
Are you okay, Mom?

28:26.958 --> 28:28.958
Yo, Lawman! Come in.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.875
Nah, I'm in a hurry, Samir.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.833
-What's up?
-Still alive.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.208
-Good, isn't it?
-Don't worry, Lawman.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.542
"You need an army to take me!

28:37.625 --> 28:39.792
You think you can kill me
with two bullets?"

28:40.375 --> 28:42.542
Demba? Can we talk?

28:56.375 --> 28:57.250
What's up?

28:58.333 --> 29:01.417
-You need to talk to the little one.
-What's he done?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.333
He got expelled from high school.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.667
He punched a teacher.
You need to talk to him.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.500
All I did at school was fight.

29:08.583 --> 29:11.833
That's my point. You need to talk to him.
He's acting like you.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.167
"Acting like me?"

29:14.000 --> 29:15.833
You and Mom love saying that.

29:15.917 --> 29:19.792
When he's good, he's like you,
and when he fucks up, he's like me?

29:19.875 --> 29:22.833
Life is about choices.
He'll do what he wants.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.542
Your choices are shaped
by your family and surroundings.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.833
"Your choices, blah, blah..."
Enough, bookworm!

29:29.042 --> 29:30.667
Why didn't you act like me?

29:31.250 --> 29:33.042
Why didn't I act like Dad?

29:34.333 --> 29:35.583
Demba this, Demba that.

29:35.667 --> 29:39.292
-If you need money, you know where I am!
-It's only for my studies.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.333
You know where the money comes from.

29:41.417 --> 29:42.958
It's all about choice.

29:43.042 --> 29:45.250
Except your choice killed Dad.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.958
-What'd you say?
-You heard me.

29:48.042 --> 29:49.083
My choice killed Dad?

29:49.167 --> 29:52.042
-He couldn't stand seeing you in jail.
-You lay your hand on me?

29:52.125 --> 29:53.625
-Demba, what's wrong?
-Get off me!

29:53.708 --> 29:54.667
-Get inside!
-Hey!

29:54.750 --> 29:56.917
Get lost before I cut you in half!

30:05.083 --> 30:06.125
You serious?

30:07.667 --> 30:10.208
Hold on. What do you think you're doing?!

30:11.917 --> 30:13.583
Have you lost your mind?

30:13.667 --> 30:14.583
Fuck!

30:33.833 --> 30:34.667
Yo!

30:37.250 --> 30:39.000
Hey, but...

30:39.083 --> 30:39.917
Fuck!

30:41.167 --> 30:42.083
"Gracious:

30:42.917 --> 30:44.583
You love the little birds, I think?

30:44.667 --> 30:50.333
I see you've managed with a fond research,
to find their tiny claws a roomy perch.

30:50.417 --> 30:51.292
Truculent:

30:51.375 --> 30:54.083
When you smoke your pipe,

30:54.167 --> 30:56.708
I suppose that the tobacco smoke
spouts from your nose--

30:56.792 --> 30:59.750
Do not the neighbors cry terror-struck:
'The chimney is afire?'"

30:59.833 --> 31:01.750
He's mad! Why is he makin' fun of himself?

31:01.833 --> 31:02.667
Exactly.

31:03.292 --> 31:06.000
It's in terms of rhetoric
that this speech is interesting.

31:06.083 --> 31:07.125
What's rhetoric?

31:08.708 --> 31:09.792
I'll let you look.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.333
R-E?

31:12.417 --> 31:13.500
No, R-H.

31:15.792 --> 31:16.750
Give me that.

31:24.167 --> 31:28.833
"Rhetoric is the science and the art
of discourse on the mind.

31:28.917 --> 31:31.875
The word derives from the Latin <i>rhetorica.</i>

31:32.667 --> 31:35.292
Do it yourself
if you think it's that easy.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.208
Rhetoric is the art of speaking well.

31:41.292 --> 31:42.625
Simple as that.

31:42.708 --> 31:44.792
-Simple as that?
-Not that complicated.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.333
-Get home safely.
-Thanks.

31:48.417 --> 31:49.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

31:50.167 --> 31:53.792
-I'm off. Lisa, thank you for coming.
-No problem.

31:53.875 --> 31:56.292
It'd be great if you could come back
next week.

31:56.375 --> 32:00.292
I'm getting ready to leave for London,
but if I find the time, I'll come.

32:00.375 --> 32:02.667
-Okay, discuss that with Soulaymaan.
-Yeah.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.542
-Have a nice evening.
-Thanks, you too.

32:04.625 --> 32:05.875
-Bye.
-Bye.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.458
London?

32:08.542 --> 32:11.375
Yeah, I got an internship at a law firm.

32:12.375 --> 32:13.625
I'm going for a year.

32:16.458 --> 32:18.292
So, this is where you live?

32:18.375 --> 32:19.208
Yep.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.208
Would you like a tour?

32:22.333 --> 32:23.167
All right.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.042
-Okay.
-Watch your step.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.583
Okay. Wait.

32:49.708 --> 32:50.542
Here it is.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.333
My secret garden.

32:53.083 --> 32:55.458
I come here when I need a break.

32:55.958 --> 32:58.125
It's... impressive.

33:10.500 --> 33:12.000
Have you lived here long?

33:13.125 --> 33:13.958
Since forever.

33:14.333 --> 33:15.875
You never wanted to leave?

33:16.458 --> 33:17.500
To go where?

33:18.083 --> 33:18.958
Paris?

33:19.417 --> 33:20.750
I couldn't live there.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.792
My whole life is here.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.792
My little brother, my mom.

33:25.875 --> 33:29.250
I can't see myself saying,
"Mom, I found a flat in Paris."

33:29.917 --> 33:32.958
For us, when we leave the family,
it's to start another one.

33:34.417 --> 33:36.333
-You only have one brother?
-No.

33:36.417 --> 33:38.042
I have two older sisters.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.000
One in Mali.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.750
The other in Limoges.

33:41.750 --> 33:42.625
And...

33:43.208 --> 33:44.625
I have an older brother.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.583
Where does he live?

33:50.125 --> 33:51.875
Let's just say he's back and forth.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.083
What about you?

33:57.333 --> 34:01.250
I had my own place at the age of 13.

34:01.333 --> 34:04.083
Where I'm from, we leave the nest early.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.250
Really?

34:05.333 --> 34:06.875
No. I live at my parents'.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.542
But they don't really live together.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.083
Are they separated?

34:14.833 --> 34:18.375
Maybe they should be, given the tension.
I don't get why they persist.

34:56.875 --> 34:59.000
It was a busy night. I'm almost out.

35:00.417 --> 35:03.875
If you could bring me a pack of coal
and 35 bags of mouth tips...

35:05.417 --> 35:07.333
If you could drop by tonight...

35:07.417 --> 35:08.875
Demba. The kid's here.

35:11.208 --> 35:12.042
Yeah.

35:13.125 --> 35:14.333
I'm counting on you.

35:16.125 --> 35:17.333
You ain't at school?

35:17.417 --> 35:18.250
No.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.583
The English teacher...

35:21.333 --> 35:22.500
is sick.

35:23.875 --> 35:24.833
What's this?

35:27.167 --> 35:28.125
Naçim did it.

35:29.333 --> 35:32.000
Sahli's nephew.
Don't worry, I kicked his ass.

35:32.083 --> 35:33.833
He punched first, that's all.

35:33.917 --> 35:36.417
-Didn't I tell you to punch first?
-I know.

35:37.625 --> 35:38.583
Grab a seat.

35:55.333 --> 35:56.208
Look at you...

35:58.125 --> 35:58.958
Thanks.

36:00.167 --> 36:01.458
What's up, Demba?

36:08.250 --> 36:09.875
Can you give me 200 euros, please?

36:10.917 --> 36:11.792
That's it?

36:12.333 --> 36:13.250
Why?

36:13.333 --> 36:14.208
I need it.

36:14.792 --> 36:15.708
What for?

36:16.417 --> 36:18.167
I want to buy a new pair of Air Max.

36:20.750 --> 36:22.792
Everyone has them.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.292
-I ain't got nothin'.
-And that's my problem?

36:25.958 --> 36:27.917
It's not a matter of how much.

36:28.625 --> 36:29.833
Check out this cash.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.250
Here it is.

36:32.542 --> 36:33.500
Take it.

36:34.375 --> 36:37.917
When I wanted something at your age,
I didn't rely on anyone.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.000
I can get by myself.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.708
Show me, then.
You want money? Go get it!

36:48.500 --> 36:49.708
Noumouké!

36:49.792 --> 36:52.333
Noumouké! Stop that and move your ass!

36:53.083 --> 36:54.958
-Over there!
-Stop yelling!

37:01.542 --> 37:02.417
Careful.

37:03.708 --> 37:05.417
Yo, people live here!

37:05.500 --> 37:07.208
Noumouké, stop that!

37:07.292 --> 37:09.708
-I know it's there.
-There's nothin' here.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.125
-Let's look somewhere else. Come on.
-It's here, stupid!

37:13.208 --> 37:14.250
Found anything? No!

37:27.208 --> 37:28.208
Fuck yeah!

37:29.042 --> 37:29.875
Yo!

37:39.792 --> 37:41.000
Put that away!

37:41.750 --> 37:43.250
Put that away!

37:43.333 --> 37:45.042
Chill out, ain't nobody in here.

37:45.125 --> 37:46.875
I'll keep it for a while.

37:46.958 --> 37:48.000
How long?

37:48.083 --> 37:49.875
Till summer. We can't spend any yet.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.958
-Where you gonna hide it?
-Think I'm gonna cheat you?

37:53.042 --> 37:54.625
-Let's split it.
-Split it now.

37:57.083 --> 38:00.500
-Be careful, or there'll be trouble.
-Yeah, yeah. I get it.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.875
Sofia, you don't realize what we're doing.

38:02.958 --> 38:05.000
-We can go on holiday.
-Shut up!

38:06.292 --> 38:08.542
Just chill out and count.

38:09.083 --> 38:10.500
You ordering me around now?

38:13.042 --> 38:16.042
Fifteen thousand each!
Fifteen thousand!

38:16.333 --> 38:17.833
Fifteen thousand!

38:17.917 --> 38:20.125
Yo, that's crazy!

38:24.458 --> 38:26.000
Paris is pretty nice, huh?

38:27.458 --> 38:28.708
I'm going to miss it.

38:30.292 --> 38:31.417
I'll miss you, too.

38:32.500 --> 38:33.625
I'll miss you, too.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.458
If that wasn't true, would you tell me?

38:37.542 --> 38:39.750
Yeah. I think so.

38:39.833 --> 38:41.792
-You liar!
-No, it's true.

38:42.625 --> 38:43.625
I'm not a liar.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.750
If you weren't a liar,
you'd be in another profession, no?

38:47.833 --> 38:49.667
That's how you see the work of a lawyer?

38:50.292 --> 38:51.833
It's about seeing facts

38:51.917 --> 38:55.042
from a point of view
sometimes far from reality, but plausible.

39:03.042 --> 39:05.292
-You know, I've been thinking...
-What?

39:06.667 --> 39:08.750
London is only two hours away by train.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.333
It's doable.

39:12.542 --> 39:13.500
That's true.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.708
Sorry, it's my little brother.

39:23.125 --> 39:24.750
-Hello.
<i>-Soulay, where are you?</i>

39:24.833 --> 39:27.250
-I'm not around
<i>-She fell over. I dunno what happened!</i>

39:27.333 --> 39:28.583
-Mom?
<i>-Mom fell over!</i>

39:28.667 --> 39:31.250
-What?!
<i>-She's on the floor! Where are you?</i>

39:31.333 --> 39:34.333
-Did you call an ambulance?
<i>-No! I don't know what to do!</i>

39:34.417 --> 39:36.958
Calm down, Noumouké. What happened?

39:37.042 --> 39:40.958
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Mom fell and she's not waking up.</i>

39:41.042 --> 39:42.583
<i>-She was fine, and then...</i>
-Call...

39:42.667 --> 39:43.833
<i>What? Call who?</i>

39:43.917 --> 39:46.125
-Don't move. I'm on my way!
<i>-Yeah.</i>

39:46.667 --> 39:49.875
Lisa, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
My mom's in trouble. Sorry.

40:14.208 --> 40:17.417
His girl.
The motherfucker'll be down any minute.

40:42.042 --> 40:43.625
The bastard's here. Balaclavas on!

41:02.083 --> 41:03.083
Lakdar!

41:08.875 --> 41:10.292
Give me the room number.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.583
Come out. I'm here.

41:23.792 --> 41:26.583
I tried calling you all night,
but got your voicemail.

41:26.667 --> 41:28.167
Tell me what happened.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.375
She had a stroke.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.875
She'll be okay. It was a little stroke.

41:35.958 --> 41:37.000
What's a little stroke?

41:37.083 --> 41:38.542
It could've been worse.

41:39.042 --> 41:40.708
She'll be out in a few days.

41:47.042 --> 41:47.958
Come in.

41:49.792 --> 41:52.625
-Drop it, she doesn't want to see me.
-Demba!

41:52.708 --> 41:53.875
She asked for you.

43:32.875 --> 43:34.167
You hungry?

43:34.250 --> 43:35.083
Yeah.

43:37.792 --> 43:38.667
Me too.

43:52.333 --> 43:53.708
We only have eggs left.

43:56.125 --> 43:58.208
Doesn't matter. An omelet's fine.

44:11.875 --> 44:14.417
LISA
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

44:24.083 --> 44:30.375
SHE'LL BE OUT IN A FEW DAYS.
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.250
I have 100 euros if you need it.

44:43.875 --> 44:45.833
We can go get groceries tomorrow.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.958
Where did you get 100 euros?

44:52.708 --> 44:54.083
Demba gave it to me.

44:55.333 --> 44:57.958
You know Mom would never
accept that money.

44:59.500 --> 45:03.167
Don't worry. We'll figure it out.
It's not your responsibility.

45:04.250 --> 45:05.333
We'll get by.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.917
<i>Who did you tell my stash was here?!</i>

45:11.000 --> 45:14.875
-You told someone! He came looking!
-Why would I do that? I'm not crazy.

45:17.333 --> 45:19.417
How did they know you weren't here?

45:19.500 --> 45:22.542
I don't know. Maybe they saw me leave
with my suitcase.

45:22.625 --> 45:23.625
Where's my money?

45:24.292 --> 45:26.958
-Where's my money?
-You're hurting me!

45:30.708 --> 45:32.083
Stop your whining!

45:32.167 --> 45:34.708
There was 30,000 euros.
Think I found it on the ground?

45:42.292 --> 45:44.583
You can always do renovations
if you want.

45:44.667 --> 45:47.208
But in this case,
the flats are rented as is.

45:48.875 --> 45:52.375
-How much rent per month?
-Four thousand two hundred euros.

45:53.583 --> 45:55.958
There's just one tenant
who hasn't paid for six months,

45:56.042 --> 45:58.333
but that's not
a big problem for you, obviously.

45:59.292 --> 46:01.125
Unless it's a family with kids.

46:04.875 --> 46:05.708
What?

46:06.250 --> 46:08.583
You want to pressure
a family with kids?

46:09.208 --> 46:11.000
If they can't pay, what do we do?

46:11.083 --> 46:13.167
If they can't pay, they can't stay.

46:13.875 --> 46:16.333
I don't do that kind of stuff.
I'm not interested.

46:20.292 --> 46:21.167
I...

46:22.083 --> 46:23.375
-I'm off.
-Okay.

46:24.625 --> 46:25.833
I'll call you later.

46:26.375 --> 46:27.208
Sure.

46:35.167 --> 46:39.125
You sell drugs to the whole district,
but can't evict people who don't pay rent?

46:39.208 --> 46:40.750
I see you've never been evicted.

46:40.833 --> 46:43.750
-You've been weird since the other night.
-Nothing to do with it.

46:44.292 --> 46:45.500
What's done is done.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.208
You sure?

46:47.292 --> 46:48.458
I'm telling you.

46:53.292 --> 46:54.500
My mom had a stroke.

46:56.542 --> 46:57.708
I didn't know, bro.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.250
You should've told me.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.000
How is she?

47:05.208 --> 47:06.083
She's okay.

47:06.833 --> 47:07.833
When did it happen?

47:08.250 --> 47:09.292
The other night.

47:11.917 --> 47:13.875
We took a life, my mom almost lost hers.

47:13.958 --> 47:15.292
Don't think like that, bro.

47:15.375 --> 47:16.250
Yo, Noumou!

47:18.042 --> 47:18.958
What's up?

47:19.042 --> 47:20.083
Chillin'.

47:20.167 --> 47:21.000
Good?

47:21.625 --> 47:22.542
What about me?

47:22.625 --> 47:24.667
-Got five euros?
-No, Chico, please.

47:24.750 --> 47:27.208
Yo, gimme five euros.

47:27.292 --> 47:29.042
You're always asking me for somethin'.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.042
Yes, five euros.
You know who I fucking am!

47:31.125 --> 47:33.292
I know! Please, no beef.

47:34.167 --> 47:36.083
-You want five euros?
-Yeah.

47:36.167 --> 47:37.000
Here.

47:39.708 --> 47:41.625
-What do you want, Chico?
-Hey, what's up?

47:41.708 --> 47:43.083
-Not much. You?
-Oh...

47:43.167 --> 47:44.083
Yeah.

47:44.167 --> 47:45.083
Fine...

47:49.167 --> 47:50.500
Where we goin'?

47:50.583 --> 47:53.375
Why, not happy to spend time
with your big bro?

47:53.458 --> 47:54.292
Yeah.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.250
We'll go see Mom,
and then go somewhere else.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.125
What you doin'?

47:59.208 --> 48:00.208
Other side. Move.

48:02.125 --> 48:03.750
Does Wors still train here?

48:06.958 --> 48:07.958
Hey, guys.

48:12.083 --> 48:12.917
Jaqueau!

48:14.167 --> 48:15.000
Here's the boy.

48:16.042 --> 48:18.792
Wanna get in the ring?
You can box Sébastien.

48:19.292 --> 48:20.458
I've never boxed before.

48:20.542 --> 48:22.750
You like your brother?
Here just for the show?

48:24.083 --> 48:24.917
You scared?

48:25.000 --> 48:26.500
-Get up here!
-Scared of who?

48:27.083 --> 48:27.958
We'll see.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.750
-What's your dad's problem?
-You know what he's like.

48:32.833 --> 48:34.708
It's 'cause you stopped boxing.

48:34.792 --> 48:36.958
I didn't. Prison stopped me boxing.

48:37.042 --> 48:38.208
Know what he'd say?

48:38.625 --> 48:40.292
-Life is...
-About choices.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.375
Exactly.

48:42.167 --> 48:44.750
-Boxing won't fill the fridge.
-Yeah.

48:44.833 --> 48:46.792
I know. Over there.

48:50.208 --> 48:51.042
Slowly.

49:00.542 --> 49:01.750
Quicker on the left.

49:02.875 --> 49:04.625
Longer strike.

49:06.917 --> 49:07.792
Longer on the left.

49:09.208 --> 49:10.500
Keep moving.

49:10.583 --> 49:11.500
On the left.

49:15.167 --> 49:16.958
Come on, focus!

49:18.875 --> 49:20.792
Don't get riled up, stay calm.

49:22.917 --> 49:25.917
Avoid the punches. Get out of the corner!

49:27.458 --> 49:28.625
Stop.

49:28.958 --> 49:29.958
Shake hands.

49:33.125 --> 49:34.125
Shake hands.

49:38.083 --> 49:40.000
-Concentrate.
-Breathe.

49:41.292 --> 49:42.167
Relax the left.

49:42.250 --> 49:44.042
Boxing is like life.

49:45.292 --> 49:46.625
You need strategy.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.125
Endurance.

49:50.208 --> 49:51.167
Strength.

49:51.667 --> 49:52.917
Anger and rage...

49:53.500 --> 49:54.750
aren't enough.

49:54.833 --> 49:55.750
Okay?

49:55.833 --> 49:56.875
Go, champ!

49:58.000 --> 49:59.625
I'll teach you to box.

50:03.125 --> 50:04.208
Get in the middle.

50:05.708 --> 50:06.625
Hands up.

50:08.125 --> 50:10.708
You're gonna move from side to side.

50:10.792 --> 50:13.042
Okay. On your toes.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.042
That's it. To the left.

50:15.125 --> 50:18.500
Light on your feet. That's it. Left.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.250
Hands up.

50:20.333 --> 50:21.375
To the right.

50:21.458 --> 50:22.417
Keep moving.

50:22.500 --> 50:23.625
Send me your left.

50:24.417 --> 50:25.417
No!

50:25.917 --> 50:29.042
Stop jumping when you throw your left.

50:29.125 --> 50:32.292
You can't walk and eat at the same time.

50:32.375 --> 50:33.292
Agreed?

50:34.583 --> 50:35.542
Watch your brother.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.042
Remember the next step?

50:40.417 --> 50:41.500
Left, right...

50:41.583 --> 50:43.125
Left, right, and dodge.

50:43.208 --> 50:46.250
One, two, three, hook, and repeat.

50:46.333 --> 50:47.667
-Okay.
-Okay, go ahead.

51:13.208 --> 51:14.083
Noumouké!

51:16.125 --> 51:16.958
Yeah?

51:18.458 --> 51:20.375
-You know Chico?
-Yeah.

51:20.458 --> 51:22.583
-He used to be legendary.
-Chico?

51:22.667 --> 51:24.042
Everyone talked about him.

51:24.125 --> 51:26.958
He had the money,
the reputation, the ladies.

51:27.458 --> 51:29.208
Everyone was afraid of him.

51:29.292 --> 51:31.708
Look at him now. You get it?

51:34.875 --> 51:36.083
You comin' back to boxing?

51:36.167 --> 51:39.458
Yeah, but next time
don't put me with a semi-pro!

51:39.833 --> 51:41.750
That's how you get stronger.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.083
Go on, get inside.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.000
It wasn't me.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.750
Yeah? Everyone says it was.

52:11.333 --> 52:13.000
Look at him when you speak!

52:13.083 --> 52:14.125
Lower your eyes.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.875
Little shits.

52:16.958 --> 52:17.875
You'll pay!

52:38.292 --> 52:39.125
What?

52:40.167 --> 52:41.042
Not happy?

52:42.250 --> 52:43.667
I'm talkin' to you!

52:43.750 --> 52:45.208
Whadda ya want?

52:46.917 --> 52:49.250
Three thousand euros a month ain't enough?

52:49.333 --> 52:51.333
If it's one of you, you'll get it!

52:51.958 --> 52:53.958
-Whadda ya want?
-I just wanna buy.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.500
I'll be back.

53:00.458 --> 53:02.458
-Whadda ya need?
-Twenty euros' worth.

53:06.042 --> 53:06.875
Here.

53:08.083 --> 53:09.500
That black dude's scary.

53:09.583 --> 53:10.792
Shut the fuck up!

53:30.000 --> 53:31.417
-Get back.
-You serious?

53:31.500 --> 53:32.333
Get back!

53:34.083 --> 53:35.917
<i>Since when does being poor...</i>

53:37.042 --> 53:40.917
<i>lead to resorting to stealing,</i>
<i>to trafficking, to violence?</i>

53:43.792 --> 53:46.125
<i>And what poverty are we talking about?</i>

53:46.833 --> 53:50.542
The precarious situation
of certain suburbanites...

53:52.167 --> 53:56.167
is luxurious and comfortable
next to what their parents fled.

53:56.792 --> 53:58.208
<i>In gathering people,</i>

53:59.375 --> 54:00.708
<i>or rather, penning them in...</i>

54:02.000 --> 54:05.417
not only blacks and Arabs,
but poor people in particular...

54:05.958 --> 54:09.500
to the "sub" of the "urban,"
the root of the word "suburb,"

54:13.167 --> 54:18.500
could the French State ignore the risk
a parallel economy would develop there?

54:20.417 --> 54:22.292
Maybe even a parallel France.

54:24.208 --> 54:27.125
If the State could not predict this,
then it did not govern.

54:27.792 --> 54:29.583
As to govern is to predict.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.333
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

54:31.417 --> 54:35.000
have you heard
of the towns Establet or Joucou?

54:36.667 --> 54:40.750
These are two small rural towns,

54:41.292 --> 54:44.500
with levels of precarity equal
to their suburban Parisian counterparts.

54:44.583 --> 54:45.417
And yet...

54:46.125 --> 54:48.167
you've never heard of them.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.083
The responsibility...

55:19.375 --> 55:20.292
Noumouké...

55:21.083 --> 55:22.000
take the key.

55:53.708 --> 55:54.542
Thank you.

55:55.958 --> 55:57.167
Thank you, boys.

56:23.042 --> 56:28.833
Allow me to cite the Argentinian author
who acquired French nationality in 1981,

56:28.917 --> 56:31.167
Julio Cortazar, who says,

56:31.625 --> 56:35.958
"Cowardice tries to throw on others
the responsibility that we refuse."

56:38.333 --> 56:40.458
Good sir, would you have the kindness

56:40.542 --> 56:44.958
to accord me two minutes of your time
to discuss the Senegalese Tirailleurs?

56:46.000 --> 56:48.125
You learn that in school now?

56:49.458 --> 56:51.667
Some, like Grandpa, fought for France

56:51.750 --> 56:54.875
because he was promised
a salary and citizenship.

56:57.500 --> 57:00.792
Yeah, but Grandpa wasn't Senegalese.
He was Malian.

57:00.875 --> 57:02.792
They were called
the Senegalese Tirailleurs

57:02.875 --> 57:04.875
because the first soldiers
came from Senegal.

57:04.958 --> 57:09.458
There were soldiers from other colonies.
Malians, Algerians, Moroccans...

57:11.292 --> 57:12.500
Need something, Mom?

57:12.583 --> 57:14.750
No. Thank you, son.

57:14.833 --> 57:16.708
I'm not handicapped.

57:26.458 --> 57:28.250
She's playing the warrior,  but...

57:28.333 --> 57:29.417
she's tired.

57:30.125 --> 57:33.875
She can't keep worrying about you.
It's not good for her health.

57:33.958 --> 57:35.750
You'd better get your diploma.

57:42.792 --> 57:43.875
Where are you going?

57:43.958 --> 57:46.375
The library. I can't concentrate at home.

57:47.125 --> 57:48.083
The library?

57:58.000 --> 57:58.833
Noumouké!

58:00.625 --> 58:01.583
Noumouké!

58:05.125 --> 58:07.000
-What's that?
-What?

58:07.958 --> 58:10.333
The clothes, the bike?
That's what you call discreet?

58:10.417 --> 58:13.208
Chill. I told everyone it was my cousin's.

58:13.292 --> 58:16.500
Your cousins ain't got shit!
If you get caught, leave me out of it!

58:27.083 --> 58:28.333
Where you running to, boy?

58:28.417 --> 58:29.500
Don't you speak French?

58:29.583 --> 58:32.250
I speak French perfectly well.
I don't get your slang.

58:32.333 --> 58:35.083
-Got a problem with slang?
-Not with my friends.

58:35.167 --> 58:37.125
But I don't believe we know each other.

58:37.208 --> 58:39.500
Let's get to know each other.
Your papers?

58:39.583 --> 58:41.667
-Papers, now!
-I've my student card.

58:42.542 --> 58:46.500
French law doesn't oblige us to be polite,
but you must carry ID.

58:46.583 --> 58:48.000
We can take you in, you know.

58:48.083 --> 58:51.000
-If you've nothing better to do.
-See, you speak informally, too.

58:51.833 --> 58:52.667
Traoré.

58:53.250 --> 58:54.208
Like Demba Traoré?

58:54.292 --> 58:56.292
-Yes, and?
-Gonna frisk you.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.125
Get back. Don't film.

58:58.792 --> 59:01.000
-Spread your legs.
-I'm gonna miss my train!

59:01.083 --> 59:02.708
-Nothing dangerous on you?
-Nothing.

59:02.792 --> 59:03.625
Check his bag.

59:03.708 --> 59:05.833
-My train! I've got class.
-Don't worry.

59:05.917 --> 59:08.250
There's nothing but books in my bag.
And a computer.

59:08.333 --> 59:10.083
-Something on him or not?
-Nothing.

59:10.167 --> 59:12.500
Let him get his train. Here.

59:13.667 --> 59:15.625
He'll get it. These creatures run fast.

59:16.750 --> 59:18.333
Run, little Sambo.

59:18.417 --> 59:20.833
He says that in front of you
and you say nothing!

59:20.917 --> 59:22.750
You think we're the same?

59:22.833 --> 59:23.667
Let's go.

59:46.500 --> 59:49.333
Hey, Soulay. Lookin' for Demba?
He's at the cafe.

59:49.417 --> 59:51.958
I'm not looking for him.
Come here a minute.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:01.208
Give me something to smoke.

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:03.000
What? Are you nuts?

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:05.458
Come on.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.000
INCOMING CALL: LISA

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:54.875
Yeah!

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.833
It's been a while.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:57.792
Yo!

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:01.625
Let go!

01:01:02.542 --> 01:01:04.125
Get in and shut the fuck up!

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.708
Letter to the Republic.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:38.250
To all these racists
and their hypocritical tolerance,

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:41.000
who built their nation on blood,

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:44.625
turn now to giving lessons.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.792
Pillager of riches.

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:48.500
Killer of Africans.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.458
Colonizers, torturer of Algerians.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.833
This colonial past is yours.

01:01:54.917 --> 01:01:59.292
You tied your history to ours!

01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:08.458
Fuck you, racists!

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Fuck your police!

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:14.750
Fuck your judges, your hypocrisy!

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:22.833
Noumouké!

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:35.292
Hey, Soulaymaan. Come here.

01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:42.458
What's wrong?

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:51.208
Look!

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:54.125
I found this in Noumouké's room.

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:57.792
Demba has nothing to do with it.

01:03:03.875 --> 01:03:04.917
Get up!

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:10.042
Get over here!

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:12.375
Here, now!

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.708
Hey, how are you?

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:35.875
-Noumouké took it from Sahli's stash.
-What?

01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:37.208
He stole it.

01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.750
-He told you?
-He admitted it, yes.

01:03:39.833 --> 01:03:41.375
We need to deal with this.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:43.833
What do you mean "we"?
What are you gonna do?

01:03:46.333 --> 01:03:49.708
-Mom knows?
-Yes, she found the money in his room.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:50.792
Little idiot!

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:53.667
-Hope she doesn't think it came from me!
-She knows.

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:02.583
Tell the boy not to leave the house
till I deal with things.

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:03.958
Okay.

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:15.500
Wrong day, Nadya. I'm late and that's all.

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:17.292
-I didn't say anything.
-Okay.

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.375
-Hi, kids.
-Hello.

01:04:32.833 --> 01:04:34.625
I don't understand exercise A.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:36.917
Number one or two?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.792
The first one, please.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:47.958
See you later, Soulaymaan.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.833
Lisa!

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:51.250
Bye.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.333
What are you playing?

01:05:01.542 --> 01:05:04.125
I've been calling you for days,
no answer.

01:05:04.208 --> 01:05:06.625
Don't pretend
you didn't see my calls or texts.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.333
You know my mom was hospitalized?

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:10.792
I know, but...

01:05:11.417 --> 01:05:14.042
You can't take five minutes to call?

01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:16.083
I can't deal with that right now.

01:05:16.167 --> 01:05:17.375
Deal with what?

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.500
Better leave it at that, you and me.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.292
I don't have a say?

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.625
-We've got the debate.
-Nothing new there.

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:27.250
Maybe we shouldn't see each other
so much. We're too different.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.792
Oh, really? How so?

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.208
Listen, let's not...

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:34.417
No, please. Share your theory.
I'm interested.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.000
We're too different!

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.917
Us, the blacks and Arabs of the suburbs,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.958
and you, the white bourgeois
from Paris, okay?

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:45.500
I'm a little white bourgeois?

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:47.750
That's how you see me?

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:50.125
No, but... Listen.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.875
Take your stupid photos!

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.042
You're so hung up!

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:56.375
You identify yourself as black
and live in fear others will do the same.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.125
We never promised each other anything.

01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:22.792
You know your little brother
really fucked up, right?

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:26.875
-Sahli might think it came from you.
-He can think what he likes.

01:06:26.958 --> 01:06:28.458
What does that mean?

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.042
If it were me, I'd go all the way.

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:33.833
-I'll go all the way if you don't pay me!
-See how he talks?

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:36.000
I'm supposed to suck his dick, too?

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.417
We know how problems start,
not how they finish.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.000
I have nothing to gain here.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:43.958
How much was there?

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.458
-Fifty thousand.
-Says you!

01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:47.000
Fifty thousand!

01:06:47.083 --> 01:06:48.000
Demba...

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.750
Let's try to move forward.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:54.083
Don't believe him, don't pay.
Take responsibility. Okay?

01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:59.333
I'll pay 25,000, not a cent more.

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:01.458
I won't pay for the girl,
I'm telling you now.

01:07:01.542 --> 01:07:04.625
Already dealt with!
She'll work for me forever!

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.208
Kill her if you want.

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:07.750
Okay for the 25,000?

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.583
Yes, but when? I need it now!

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:13.625
You down to your last euros?
I'll send Farid tomorrow.

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:15.208
-What time?
-Tomorrow I said!

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:17.917
Hey, I backed you both.

01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:20.458
Don't want one of you
stabbing me in the back.

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.250
I say it as it is.

01:07:22.333 --> 01:07:24.583
-And I'm a bitch, is that it?
-Up to you.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:25.500
Oh, yeah?

01:07:36.792 --> 01:07:38.875
-If you wanna take down Sahli, I'm in.
-I know.

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:41.792
Don't give a fuck about Abdel.
I'll take him down if I need to.

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:43.125
Abdel won't hurt me.

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:44.542
I stuck by him.

01:07:44.625 --> 01:07:45.792
Be careful.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.417
I heard he was involved in some shit
with guys from Marseille.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.250
-He's in trouble.
-Why?

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.583
Money, what else?

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:56.000
He's broke. Watch out.

01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:09.125
<i>His spot earns ten to 15,000 a day.</i>
<i>More than me, son of a bitch!</i>

01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:12.250
<i>Ten to 15,000 a day?</i>

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.792
How much was in Sahli's stash?

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:19.042
Thirty thousand euros.

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:24.667
I swear! Thirty thousand euros.
I took 15 and Sofia 15.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.750
I didn't spend a cent.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.500
Now you start crying?

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:31.832
Scram!

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.417
That piece of shit is here.

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:58.750
Stay where you are.

01:09:08.707 --> 01:09:10.542
Don't bother, there's 15,00 euros.

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:13.082
We said 25,000, Demba.

01:09:16.832 --> 01:09:19.125
There was 30,000 euros,
and you know it.

01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:21.167
Take that or you'll get nothing!

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.125
The fuck?

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:27.582
Son of a bitch! Move and I'll shoot!

01:09:32.207 --> 01:09:33.375
Get in the car.

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.625
Hey, Sahli, get up.

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:51.457
What are you lookin' at?

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.333
What's up, guys?

01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:09.708
-How you doin'?
-Yeah, good.

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:30.333
Did you see Sahli?

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:33.167
-Don't worry, he won't touch the kid.

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:34.708
Okay.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.542
I wanted to apologize
for what I said last time.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:40.833
I didn't even think it.

01:10:40.917 --> 01:10:43.292
Don't worry, we won't mention it again.

01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:49.417
Farid said you asked him for a joint.
What's going on?

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.958
Fuck. I told him to keep his mouth shut.

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:55.458
Think he'd hide that from me?
You wanna smoke, don't come to us.

01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:58.000
I've got the debate final tomorrow.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.375
I was stressed out.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:01.083
You don't need that.

01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:03.792
Stick to your thing.

01:11:05.125 --> 01:11:06.125
I'm off.

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.958
Come by and see Mom sometime.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.208
She'd be pleased.

01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:24.167
Okay.

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.250
Good evening, all.

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.875
The topic of this debate is the following:

01:11:56.958 --> 01:12:00.000
Is the State solely responsible

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:03.750
for the current situation
in the French suburbs?

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:06.500
For the affirmative, Ms. Crèvecœur.

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.708
For the negative, Mr. Traoré.

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:09.917
The floor is yours.

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:13.042
Emancipation!

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:17.958
E-man-ci-pa-tion!

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:23.667
My position is founded on the principles
of emancipation and responsibility.

01:12:24.583 --> 01:12:29.000
Hers, without a doubt, on victimization.

01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:37.708
On September 21, 1792,
the monarchy was abolished in France.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:44.833
Today, our governors,
called "the State" for our debate,

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:48.000
don't find themselves in positions
of responsibility unintentionally.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:52.458
These responsibility bulimics
go so far as to accumulate mandates.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:56.042
And in doing so, they accumulate...

01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:57.958
Responsibilities.

01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.417
Allow me to cite two quotes,
Master Soulaymaan--

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.417
Master!

01:13:02.583 --> 01:13:03.458
Master!

01:13:04.375 --> 01:13:06.042
I didn't ask for that.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.792
I am but a mere law student.

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:12.542
However, it would be difficult for me
to call this individual "Master".

01:13:12.625 --> 01:13:15.333
Not because of the painful history
of my ancestors,

01:13:15.417 --> 01:13:18.333
made slaves by her ancestors
for over 400 years.

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:24.000
It is difficult for me
to call her "Master"

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:27.458
because of the lamentable mediocrity
of her defense.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.417
Boring...

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:31.125
repetitive...

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:33.333
and ultimately, unconvincing.

01:13:33.417 --> 01:13:36.250
But I'll let you find that out
for yourselves.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.250
What a disappointment!

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:43.375
What a disappointment to learn
that my model,

01:13:43.458 --> 01:13:44.792
the magnificent Soulaymaan...

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:46.000
Sorry, I mean...

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:47.625
Soulaymaan the Magnificent...

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:51.167
finds my defense boring,

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.417
repetitive, and unconvincing.

01:13:54.208 --> 01:13:57.708
Well, I'm not afraid to say it,
Great Master Soulaymaan,

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:02.417
I find you captivating,

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.708
discerning,

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:05.083
inspiring,

01:14:05.167 --> 01:14:06.083
stimulating...

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:07.000
Thank you!

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.167
And so many other adjectives
ending with -ing.

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.500
If we recognize the State

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:19.417
as solely responsible for the current
situation of the French suburbs,

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:24.667
we must then imagine these people believe
they have suffered a prejudice,

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:26.667
institute civil proceedings,

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.167
and demand compensation.

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:32.792
These so-called compensations
would be financed by the Crèvecœur tax.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.333
A new tax also known as CVDFS.

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:37.792
But what is this CVDFS?

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.875
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:43.542
CVDFS is the Compensation
for the Victimization

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:45.833
and of total Dependence
of the French Suburbs.

01:14:46.875 --> 01:14:47.792
An example?

01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:49.583
I missed my train,

01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:53.292
and I'm late for a job interview.

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:58.625
It's not because I overslept
by 15 minutes. No!

01:14:58.708 --> 01:15:00.125
A small hit of CVDFS.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.583
It's the fault of the French State.

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:09.000
Lisa Crèvecœur, you don't want
these people to take control.

01:15:09.083 --> 01:15:13.000
You only see their future through
the guise of unemployment benefits.

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:17.167
A way for you to limit their aspirations
and their success.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:22.833
You need them to remain
permanently distressed and victimized.

01:15:22.917 --> 01:15:26.500
What you need is for them to need you...

01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:31.625
so that you feel less guilty...

01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:36.208
less guilty about all the comforts
you've had since childhood.

01:15:36.833 --> 01:15:39.125
Not guilty about being white.

01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:47.750
"Less guilty about all the comforts
I've had since childhood," he tells us.

01:15:48.333 --> 01:15:50.833
It's true that we're different
in many ways...

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:53.792
Us, the white bourgeois
from central Paris,

01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:56.708
to you, the blacks and Arabs
from the suburbs.

01:15:57.667 --> 01:15:59.667
I admit never having been in need.

01:16:00.333 --> 01:16:03.083
From birth,
we were not in the same position.

01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:04.542
Nothing new there.

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:06.458
I was born in a private clinic.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:09.250
A clinic owned by my father,

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:12.542
who just so happens so be here with us.

01:16:13.333 --> 01:16:17.292
Easily recognizable, he sits on a chair
covered in diamonds and rubies.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.708
Shall I stop there?

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:22.833
I think you've understood

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:25.958
that I'm a white bourgeois woman
from central Paris.

01:16:26.042 --> 01:16:29.583
Soulaymaan doesn't need to make this
the pillar of his defense.

01:16:32.042 --> 01:16:35.542
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
the Grand Soulaymaan before you

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:38.208
hopes that just by seeing him,

01:16:38.292 --> 01:16:41.125
you will conclude
that social mobility exists.

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:47.458
He is what Malcolm X termed
a "house negro"

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:50.458
Or what his own community call
"a bounty".

01:16:51.292 --> 01:16:54.375
Black on the outside
and white on the inside.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:56.708
Wow, she's giving it to him!

01:17:02.042 --> 01:17:03.125
Zyed and Bouna...

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:05.625
Ali Ziri...

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:08.417
Adama Traoré...

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.833
All killed directly or indirectly
by the police,

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:15.833
the State's armed force.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:20.542
How can you tell the families
of victims of police violence

01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:23.125
that the State is in no way responsible.

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:27.292
Tell Amal Bentounsi,
who's here with us today,

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:30.125
whose brother was shot in the back
by a policeman,

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:32.500
that the State is not responsible

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:35.125
for the fact that the victims
of police violence

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:38.125
are most often
French of immigrant origin...

01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:40.958
and that the police in these cases

01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:44.917
are almost never condemned,
or otherwise with laughable sentences.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.667
Mr. Traoré, a response?

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:56.083
You know,

01:17:56.625 --> 01:17:59.250
I never fantasized
about life in the suburbs,

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:04.042
to deform the reality
with the lens of a camera.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.250
The suburbs? I know them.

01:18:10.042 --> 01:18:10.917
I live there.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.750
And it's true that in the suburbs
there is talent.

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:17.083
There are ideas.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19.500
There is intelligence.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.542
There are dreams.

01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:25.333
But life is about choices.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.875
Lisa Crèvecœur,

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:30.625
when two drug dealers from the suburbs

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:34.250
make war for purely financial reasons,

01:18:34.333 --> 01:18:36.875
and this war takes the life
of one of them,

01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:39.208
is it the State who arms the assassin?

01:18:42.542 --> 01:18:44.958
Is it the State who arms the assassin?

01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:48.167
Forces him to pull the trigger?

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:53.958
Is it the State who prevents suburbanites
from coming together?

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:55.000
From uniting?

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:59.458
From improving their situation themselves?

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:02.375
Or to protect their youth
from making the same mistakes?

01:19:02.917 --> 01:19:04.917
I'll tell you what prevents them!

01:19:05.667 --> 01:19:06.917
It's greed...

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:08.667
jealousy...

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:12.542
and the total absence
of what we call "the common good".

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:16.583
Because there are two ways
to combat poverty.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.583
Solidarity...

01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:21.042
or each man for himself.

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:22.958
It's always a matter of choice.

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:27.417
Please now conclude.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:30.667
Duels without armor...

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:34.167
A man and a woman
opposed by so many factors.

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.625
It's time to conclude, I devote myself,

01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:38.583
turn my back on prose.

01:19:38.667 --> 01:19:41.542
If my verse touches you,
stings your heart,

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:44.625
leaves you stranded
with a swift backhand,

01:19:44.708 --> 01:19:46.917
oh, Queen of Bitterness,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.125
call me Cyrano.

01:19:53.208 --> 01:19:54.417
Who is the State?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.958
You?

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.083
Me?

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:01.792
Us?

01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:07.458
Our so-called democratic system
is nothing but a masquerade.

01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:11.875
The 49.3 law, the decrees are
but the tip of the iceberg.

01:20:12.292 --> 01:20:15.625
The State is not the people,
as they haven't made decisions

01:20:15.708 --> 01:20:18.958
on internal or foreign policy
for a long time.

01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:21.625
I am not sure they ever did.

01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:28.250
Who here feels they have real influence
on the future of this country when voting?

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:29.917
Liberty is a fact.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.917
I have it. I believe in it. I proclaim it.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.000
Target for wrongdoing,
I don't shy from combat.

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:37.917
I'd rather raise my weapon.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.333
I am not a spectator of my life.

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:42.125
I am its subject.

01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:46.000
From nightmares, I survive
until my dreams become realized.

01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:48.458
We are proposed,

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:50.542
or rather ordered,

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:53.792
to always vote for candidates
from the same cast...

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:56.875
who share the same world vision.

01:20:56.958 --> 01:21:00.458
But these people don't even act
on their election promises.

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:03.667
Those who pushed us
to appoint them to govern.

01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:07.875
They pretend to divide into parties
and give us a choice.

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:10.958
But these stubborn careerists,
controlled by the ogres of finance,

01:21:11.542 --> 01:21:13.792
have no scruples in passing
from one to another.

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:17.458
My hope flies on the wings
of my fearlessness.

01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:20.875
My courage emerges
from the depths of adversity.

01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:24.875
Audacious, proud, I take part willingly
in the battle of life.

01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:28.708
Even when the battle inspires anger,
I take no pity.

01:21:28.792 --> 01:21:30.792
"The State" is not you.

01:21:30.875 --> 01:21:34.917
I will never accept that the State
is responsible for all my sorrows.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.083
"The State" is not only the rich.

01:21:37.167 --> 01:21:41.125
Accepting this idea means accepting
being a victim for the torturer.

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:44.042
"The State" is not only whites.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:47.875
Accepting to be a victim
is akin to giving up arms.

01:21:47.958 --> 01:21:51.958
Passive victimization
is fertile ground for defeat.

01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:55.792
My very presence defeats your equation:

01:21:55.875 --> 01:22:00.500
the suburbs plus poverty leads fatally
to the grave or incarceration.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:05.750
"The State" hasn't recognized
the amplitude of moral damage,

01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:08.458
caused by territorial,

01:22:08.542 --> 01:22:10.500
and yes, I'll say it,
racial discrimination.

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:14.375
I, suburbanite of ebony skin,
disrupt your fantasies.

01:22:14.458 --> 01:22:18.750
I tell you without sarcasm,
my place is not in prison.

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:23.333
"The State" is those who,
with the complicity of the media,

01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:27.417
have succeeded in dividing our country

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.250
while coldly manipulating
the consequences

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.667
without ever thinking about the causes.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:35.792
This comes with responsibility.

01:22:35.875 --> 01:22:40.000
I won't give you, or the State,
the power to decide for me.

01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:45.000
Victim or soldier,
remember which of the two I choose.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.708
He's a real Traoré!

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:39.667
-Listen, Lisa, for the last time...
-We didn't promise each other anything.

01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:42.000
I shouldn't have insisted.

01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:46.792
I've had a lot of problems lately.
I was overcome with stress.

01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:47.792
I get it.

01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:51.125
You don't have to explain. Don't worry.

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.750
-Whatever the result...
-I leave for London tomorrow...

01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:55.917
for my internship.

01:23:56.417 --> 01:23:59.125
-I don't know when I'll be back.
-When do you leave?

01:23:59.208 --> 01:24:00.167
I just told you.

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:02.958
-Tomorrow.
-What time?

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:06.583
4:15 p.m., Gare du Nord station.

01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:15.000
I'll be there to say goodbye.

01:24:23.542 --> 01:24:25.500
The jury has deliberated.

01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:26.417
Let's go.

01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:17.000
GRADUATE CERTIFICATE:
PERSUASIVE ORATORY CONTEST 2018

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.375
Traoré, Alhamdulillah.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:23.875
Traoré.

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.250
Yo, Lawman!

01:25:53.792 --> 01:25:57.417
He's taking a seat!
We've become socially acceptable.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.042
Need to get used to it.
You'll be my clients soon.

01:26:00.125 --> 01:26:03.458
If we need you to avoid prison,
that means we've got no money!

01:26:03.542 --> 01:26:05.125
I saw him defend, he's good!

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:06.583
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:08.375
Want a drink?

01:26:08.458 --> 01:26:11.500
No time, gotta get the train.
Gotta meet someone.

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.708
Have a drink. I'll drop you off after.

01:26:13.792 --> 01:26:15.625
Okay. An orange juice then.

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.917
You really impressed me yesterday.

01:26:18.875 --> 01:26:21.167
-Yeah, but I didn't win.
-You didn't lose.

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:25.583
It was a tie. It was close!
Even I didn't know what to think.

01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:30.333
-I really liked what Mirabeau said.
-Mirabeau was there?

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:31.792
President of the jury.

01:26:32.417 --> 01:26:34.042
What did he say again?

01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:36.167
-"You gave..."
-He's a big gun!

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:40.000
The lawyer I had for my last case
was from his firm. He's a killer!

01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:44.083
Believe it or not, I have an interview
there on Monday for an internship.

01:26:44.167 --> 01:26:46.792
So, I was saying, he said, "You've not--"

01:26:46.875 --> 01:26:49.875
-That's some serious shit.
-Shut up! Let me speak.

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:54.667
Listen. He said,
"You haven't given us answers,

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:58.583
but you allowed us to question
the ready-made answers we're given."

01:27:12.167 --> 01:27:13.875
Why you going to the station?

01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:16.083
-The girl opposite me in the debate?
-Yeah.

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:18.333
She's off to London for a year.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:20.875
I just wanna say bye.

01:27:20.958 --> 01:27:22.917
He's gonna get some!

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.500
That's crap!

01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:27.125
Leave him alone, he's discreet.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.125
Soulaymaan, listen.

01:27:29.208 --> 01:27:32.250
"In this country,
you gotta make money first.

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.250
When you get the money,
you get the power."

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:36.500
"When you get the power,
you get the women."

01:27:37.083 --> 01:27:38.083
He knows it!

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:40.333
Think I live in a cave or what?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.500
EXAMINATION NOTICE

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:02.208
-I'll take you to the station.
-Yeah?

01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:06.583
-Rim, tell Samir I'm taking my brother.
-Okay.

01:28:09.625 --> 01:28:10.458
Soulay!

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:20.542
INCOMING CALL: LISA

01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:07.250
Demba?

01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:08.167
Demba?!

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.667
Wake up, bro! Demba!

01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:14.708
Wake up! Demba! Call an ambulance!

01:29:15.208 --> 01:29:17.083
Demba! Wake up!

01:29:17.167 --> 01:29:18.375
Demba!

01:29:18.458 --> 01:29:20.167
Demba!

01:29:21.375 --> 01:29:23.708
Call an ambulance!

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.042
Call an ambulance!

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:29.917
Call an ambulance!
