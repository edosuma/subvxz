be the last time

40:39.704 --> 40:41.905
I would ever see him,

40:41.907 --> 40:45.909
And I remember when they
were wheeling him away,

40:45.911 --> 40:48.845
I just kept watching
until he was gone.

I hate being a daddy's girl.

I got a phone call
that he had passed away,

41:19.211 --> 41:23.746
And I felt I thought
I was going to feel...

41:25.817 --> 41:29.452
A relief and no more guilt,

41:29.454 --> 41:33.656
But that's when
it all seemed to --

41:33.658 --> 41:35.925
All the guilt fell on me.

41:35.927 --> 41:39.262
I felt like I had the burden

41:39.264 --> 41:42.832
Of the things that he had done.

41:42.834 --> 41:48.037
I felt like my dad kind of
ran out on his sentence

41:48.039 --> 41:51.274
And put it on me.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.277
It was really hard for me
to accept.

41:56.414 --> 42:01.317
I often ask myself
if my dad loved me,

42:01.319 --> 42:03.953
And...

42:03.955 --> 42:06.256
Oh, god.

I believe he did love us.

42:09.127 --> 42:12.962
I believe that
there were two people.

There was the good one

And I think, unfortunately,
the bad won a lot of times.

I'm here because I hope I can
let the victims' family know

42:27.078 --> 42:33.850
That there is remorse
from the family.

42:33.852 --> 42:36.586
I'm sorry this happened to you,

42:36.588 --> 42:40.857
And I wish I could go back

42:40.859 --> 42:45.094
And change what happened,

42:45.096 --> 42:47.130
But you can't.
