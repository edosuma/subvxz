WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:12.178
Squad Commander Blue,
this is Squad Commander Red.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.390
Cheese.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.851
Possible rebel suspect.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.644
Inspection initiated.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.108
Scanning for rebel soldiers.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.407
Resistance icon identified.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.908
-It's a trap.

00:34.993 --> 00:35.952
Now!

00:48.381 --> 00:51.551
Recording initiated.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.220
Eat plasma, you dirty bots.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.768
Blue hedgehog detected.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.436
Whoa!

01:04.397 --> 01:07.233
I'm back in New Yolk City?

01:07.317 --> 01:10.070
-How did I end up back--

01:10.153 --> 01:12.072
For a better tomorrow!

01:12.155 --> 01:14.032
Who's with me?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.423
New Yolk City
isn't quite how I remember it.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.966
Sonic?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.052
Never thought I'd see
your smug mug again.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.136
Where were you?

01:39.057 --> 01:41.226
Dude, I had zero
intention of leaving you.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.145
I touched the Shard and I got
zipped into another world

01:44.229 --> 01:46.231
with another you
fighting another battle.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.649
Shard?

01:47.732 --> 01:50.193
You mean
that energy crystal thingy?

01:50.276 --> 01:51.402
Yeah. That.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.531
Shard?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.366
Anyway, super stoked
to be back to help

01:56.449 --> 01:58.284
with whatever
the heck's going on here.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.370
Where's Nine?
I gotta pick his brain

02:00.453 --> 02:02.080
about this other Shard I found.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.500
Nine? I ought to be asking
you the same question.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.168
Now do me a solid and pipe down.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.753
I got shells to crack.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.508
Nice spin attack,
by the way.

02:13.591 --> 02:16.010
But I bet you can't do this.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.979
Retreat.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.492
Still bummed about me
disappearing.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.203
Come on.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.038
All right.
Everybody scatter.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.716
<i>First,</i>
<i>they steal our energy crystal.</i>

02:54.799 --> 02:57.844
Now these ants decide
to stand up for themselves?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.888
How dare they.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.850
The baby is right.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.311
We won't rest
until every last rebel

03:06.394 --> 03:08.229
has been sentenced to oblivion.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.399
Or until
our backup power runs out.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.653
Sonic is back.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.745
<i>I had zero intention</i>
<i>of leaving you.</i>

03:23.828 --> 03:25.496
<i>I touched the Shard</i>
<i>and I got zipped</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:27.248
<i>into another world</i>
<i>with another you</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:28.458
<i>fighting another battle.</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:30.376
Another world?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.545
And what does he mean by "Shard"?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.632
He means
the energy crystal. Duh.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.759
<i>Where's Nine?</i>
<i>I gotta pick his brain</i>

03:37.842 --> 03:39.385
<i>about this other Shard I found.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:41.763
What?
Another Shard?

03:41.846 --> 03:44.057
We can power
a city with one Shard.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.809
Imagine what we could do
with two Shards.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.771
There might be
like several Shards.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.022
Huh?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.566
We have to find that hedgehog.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.235
If he's seen another Shard,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.403
then maybe he can lead us to it.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.863
If my readings are correct,

03:58.947 --> 04:00.823
the last indication
of his energy

04:00.907 --> 04:02.700
was in Deep's District.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.452
Let's smoke them out.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.621
Send in the bots.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.633
I take it you radioed ahead

04:18.716 --> 04:20.551
and let Rebel know what's what.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.970
I did.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.389
Look who decided
to drop in.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.683
Welcome back.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.351
Here to face the music?

04:28.434 --> 04:30.687
Depends what kind of music.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.563
Am I sensing a negative vibe?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.816
Using us to help you
steal the Shard

04:34.899 --> 04:37.986
then deserting us as soon as you got
what you came for?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.281
Yeah, I'd say the vibe
is pretty negative.

04:41.364 --> 04:45.285
I should let the Chaos Council
turn you into a handbag.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.288
Uh, I thought
you explained everything.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.207
I did. She didn't care.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.251
The rodent is lying.
Let's toast him.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.044
I didn't steal the Shard.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.671
But your fox friend did,

04:56.754 --> 04:59.132
right before he left us
high and dry.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.925
He did?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.177
And to think
we believed in you.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.099
<i>After sticking</i>
<i>our necks out like we did.</i>

05:30.246 --> 05:31.998
<i>Backup systems engaged.</i>

05:32.081 --> 05:34.208
They have the energy crystal!

05:34.292 --> 05:35.168
Got it.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.515
Find them.
They can't be far.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.832
Initiating system override.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.543
Chaos Council
programming restored.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.392
<i>Word of our work</i>
<i>spread throughout the city.</i>

06:33.476 --> 06:37.188
<i>Our army grew without you</i>
<i>or that traitorous fox.</i>

06:40.483 --> 06:44.112
And, tonight, we finally
finish what we started.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.532
I skip town for a day
and you cook up a revolution?

06:47.615 --> 06:50.243
A day?
You've been gone weeks.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.203
Weeks? Really?

06:52.995 --> 06:55.331
Time must move
differently there.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.958
All that matters right now

06:57.041 --> 06:59.168
is taking out the council
while we still can.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.379
If they get
that energy crystal back,

07:01.462 --> 07:02.839
we're done for.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.674
Nine won't let that happen.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.008
You tell us where he is

07:06.092 --> 07:07.760
and we'll make sure he doesn't.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.721
-How would I know?
-I smell baloney.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.474
-Let's put the screws to him.
-Come on, boss.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.977
Let me tear this scoundrel
limb from limb.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.312
Screws and baloney
would taste terrible.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.481
There's better ways
to get more iron in your diet.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.025
Jokes? After all
we've been through?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.278
Don't you understand
what's at stake?

07:42.211 --> 07:44.964
It's a symbol
of the life we deserve,

07:45.047 --> 07:47.758
growing and thriving in peace.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.552
If we lose this fight,

07:49.635 --> 07:52.013
there won't be anything left
to fight for.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.601
The palm.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.605
Ta-da!

08:05.067 --> 08:07.361
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.864
but I'm not a traitor
and neither is Nine.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.616
Let me prove it to you.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.326
Let me fight by your side.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.664
It's the Chaos Council.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.791
They've located us.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.386
Secure the tree!

08:32.470 --> 08:33.804
How did they find us?

08:33.888 --> 08:35.264
It can't be a coincidence.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.682
Everyone up top

08:36.766 --> 08:38.267
before our location
is compromised.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.777
They are somewhere
near. Continue the attack.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.404
We will force them out.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.657
Not on my watch, automaton.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.239
Surrender the energy crystal
and we'll promise

09:33.322 --> 09:36.200
to make your demise
quick and painless.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.827
We need backup.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.255
Sonic, hang on!

09:49.338 --> 09:50.631
Nine?

09:50.715 --> 09:52.967
You got a plane... kinda.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.637
Wait. Was that an energy portal?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.514
How did he do that?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.725
It's the fox
who stole the Shard.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.809
Get him!

10:34.425 --> 10:37.219
Nine! Holy, man.
Just in time!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.846
We could really use some backup.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.848
Whoa. Whoa.
Where are we going?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.853
We got a fight on our hands
back there and--

10:45.936 --> 10:47.563
What did you just do?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.774
-I opened a portal.
-Whoa.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.026
I think I cross
through here

10:52.109 --> 10:54.695
every time I enter
the other worlds.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.530
I call them Shatterspaces.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.240
Huh, I guess that makes sense.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.826
Really glad to see you
but we have to go back.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.287
-The rebels need my help.
-Not until you tell me

11:03.371 --> 11:05.456
-where you've been.
-Well...

11:08.209 --> 11:10.628
Whoa.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.171
Then you showed up
in your spaceship

11:12.254 --> 11:14.882
and pulled me into
this portal thingy.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.509
That confirms
what I've discovered.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.469
From the moment you vanished,

11:18.552 --> 11:21.055
I suspected there was more
to the Shard than I'd realized.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.727
So you <i>did </i>take it.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.397
Yeah, that and I hacked into
their power core schematics.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.065
Pretty elementary.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.983
So I adapted them and
created the Shatter Drive.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.195
Now we can travel the
Shatterverse at our discretion.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.530
Shatter what?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.156
This is cool
and everything

11:39.532 --> 11:41.242
but we really gotta
get back to New Yolk.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.369
I have to show you what I found.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.592
Another world?!

11:58.676 --> 12:01.262
Welcome to our bright
new future.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.848
I call it The Grim.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.226
Yeah, that seems accurate.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.228
What?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.439
Fascinating.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.233
Your shoes have
recalibrated to The Grim.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.360
Yeah, I get a fancy upgrade

12:16.444 --> 12:18.446
every time I enter
a new Shatterspace.

12:18.779 --> 12:22.032
Huh. Prism energy
truly is magnificent.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.119
We're only just scratching
the surface of its capabilities.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.621
Be on the lookout
for whacked-out versions of you,

12:27.705 --> 12:29.623
me, or anyone else
you might know.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.542
That's the best part of all.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.712
There's no one here.
It's a clean slate.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.174
The perfect place to start over
and get the world right.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.343
With the proper fortifications
and enough Shard energy,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.095
it could be home.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.805
The one you lost.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.807
The one I never had.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.769
I can make that hope a reality,
for both of us.

12:50.853 --> 12:55.441
Look, Nine, it's incredible
but it's not going anywhere.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.735
And those rebels
really need our help.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.654
Come with me.
Help me finish the fight.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.909
That city never brought me
anything but misery.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.327
I owe it nothing.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.245
I'll help you get back...

13:09.538 --> 13:11.332
but I have work to do.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.088
I hope
I see you in New Yolk.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.968
-<i>Sonic.</i>

13:23.052 --> 13:25.179
-Huh?
-<i>Sonic.</i>

13:29.266 --> 13:31.393
-I'm out.
-Same.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.188
Lousy Egg tech.
You can't trust it.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.203
Surrender the energy crystal.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.623
Or tell us where the hedgehog
went. We're not picky.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.124
We don't know where they are.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.918
And wouldn't tell you if we did.

13:56.001 --> 13:59.338
Spill it, punks,
or we'll spill something else.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.131
I got a better idea.

14:01.215 --> 14:05.094
How about you bums line up
and kiss my bright red--

14:05.177 --> 14:07.137
Another portal?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.693
Uh, I know, I know.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.278
No more vanishing
into thin air.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.988
Let's just beat
these guys to a pulp

14:24.071 --> 14:25.573
and if you still think
I'm a traitor,

14:25.656 --> 14:27.992
then you can screw my baloney.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.660
Better late than never.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.287
That's the spirit.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.802
Hey. Play nice.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
Isn't it past your bedtime?

15:00.107 --> 15:02.443
Get ready to give it
everything you got.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.362
Pull!

15:09.199 --> 15:11.243
Oh, I love this game.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.787
Let's see what
you're made of, blue.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.289
Hit the jets.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.346
Comin' in hot. Take cover!

15:32.014 --> 15:33.807
How is a baby so mean?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.280
-Rebel!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.409
Ah-ah-ah.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.337
A noble effort.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.174
It wasn't noble.
It was annoying.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.926
Enough games.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.552
Hand over the crystal,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.596
or we'll stick you
in a hamster wheel

16:12.680 --> 16:16.266
and see how long you can keep
the lights on before you drop.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.396
Pace yourself,
Dr. Babble.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.064
And while we're at it,

16:22.147 --> 16:25.859
do tell about another world
with another Shard.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.029
That's what you're calling
the energy crystal, aren't you?

16:29.113 --> 16:31.281
-We're all ears.
-Really?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.701
I mean, I'd say you're more
jowls but I honestly

16:33.784 --> 16:36.078
have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.331
This should
jog your memory.

16:39.415 --> 16:43.335
Rusty Amy? Yes!
Butt kicking time.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.004
Rusty Rose.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.423
I have returned
to my original directive

16:47.506 --> 16:49.633
under the Chaos Council.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.927
Oh, no butt kicking.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.389
<i>I had zero intention</i>
<i>of leaving you</i>

16:55.472 --> 16:58.058
<i>and I got zipped into</i>
<i>another world with another you</i>

16:58.142 --> 17:00.060
<i>fighting another battle.</i>
<i>Where's Nine?</i>

17:00.144 --> 17:02.146
<i>I gotta pick his brain</i>
<i>about this other Shard I found.</i>

17:06.108 --> 17:08.444
Gulp.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.574
You will talk, cretin,

17:13.657 --> 17:15.784
or you will scream.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.584
Did he just do
that portal thingy again?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.056
My scan indicates
he has the Shard.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.142
There is heavy
prismatic energy on the craft.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.770
This confirms everything
we've suspected.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.313
And more.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.648
The Shard was never
just an energy source.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.742
Nine, you came!

17:56.825 --> 17:58.660
When this is over,
I'm going home

17:58.744 --> 18:01.163
and never looking back.
Whether I go it alone

18:01.246 --> 18:03.040
is entirely up to you.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.917
I knew you'd come back, buddy.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.297
He's using our Shard's energy
to teleport somehow.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.091
He's not teleporting.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.094
That fox has figured out
how to travel to other worlds.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.929
The plan has changed.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.139
We need to capture that craft.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.142
Deep, Babble,
full volley at the rebel HQ.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.727
I'll lure the fox away.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.396
Don't, Done It,
prepare the mother ship.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.357
Yeah. Fine.
Whatevs.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.532
I'll take 'em low.
You take 'em high.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.033
Already on it.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.623
We're back on.
Let's take these clowns down

18:44.706 --> 18:46.041
once and for all.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.126
Once again,

18:47.209 --> 18:48.544
better late than never.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.629
Hey, I never
let you down, Rebel.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.841
When you say "never,"
you do mean "all the time?"

18:53.924 --> 18:56.051
-No time for small talk.

19:07.729 --> 19:08.939
What an amateur.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.482
Time to put some scuff marks

19:10.566 --> 19:12.109
on that fancy paint job.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.261
I've got this weasel on the run.
Prepare for launch!

19:47.477 --> 19:49.104
Time to go home.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.024
Eggforcers,
keep them distracted.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.266
Fox shmox,

20:26.350 --> 20:28.602
what we've got here
is a sitting duck.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.189
No, no, no, no!

20:43.283 --> 20:45.661
Come on, come on, come on.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.412
One more portal
and I'm home free.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.750
No!

20:57.547 --> 20:59.925
Rusty, the vermin
is on the bus.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.678
I repeat,
the vermin is on the bus.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.390
Eggforcers, finish them off.
We have what we need.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.573
-Yes! We did it!

21:23.657 --> 21:25.826
-You guys good?
-We're good.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.120
Not sure what happened
to your friend though.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.789
I don't like this.
The Shard could be anywhere.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.457
You're right.
I better find him

21:32.541 --> 21:34.251
before he portals
out of here again.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.335
Back in a flash.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.923
I still don't trust that guy.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.554
With our Shard and your tech,

21:45.637 --> 21:47.639
you've just handed us
the universe

21:47.723 --> 21:50.309
on a silver platter.
