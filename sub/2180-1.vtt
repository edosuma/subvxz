WEBVTT

02:36.782 --> 02:39.118
Dead eyes of the night...

02:40.828 --> 02:43.330
...stare at me not!

03:17.072 --> 03:19.283
Long ago...

03:20.367 --> 03:24.330
...our lands were the scene of a great battle.

03:27.708 --> 03:32.546
It was a bloody and glorious time.

03:36.425 --> 03:42.014
But now, peace reigns in these lands, and we all enjoy it.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.187
Welcome, Wirepa.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.315
Your father is not with you?

03:51.815 --> 03:54.026
He apologises...

03:55.778 --> 03:57.780
...and sends you his regards.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.534
Let us go then...

04:02.534 --> 04:05.496
...to the Place of Bones.

04:18.801 --> 04:23.931
It is noble of you to listen to your ancestors...

04:23.931 --> 04:27.059
...and seek proper burial for them.

04:28.811 --> 04:35.234
We have not hunted or fished here since the great war...

04:38.237 --> 04:42.408
...your ancestors have been honoured all these years.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.620
May you find what you seek.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.886
Do you still walk here, my ancestors?

05:43.886 --> 05:47.723
I will avenge your deaths.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.313
You will sing my name...

05:55.689 --> 05:57.858
...and of my glory.-

06:13.123 --> 06:16.543
Welcome me, my noble ancestors.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.273
I have a gift for you.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.606
Sacrilege!

07:26.071 --> 07:28.115
You dare lay hands on a chief's son?

07:28.907 --> 07:30.534
Sacrilege!

07:31.660 --> 07:32.995
There in the forest...

07:33.745 --> 07:35.164
...your son...

07:36.081 --> 07:40.252
...defiling the bones of my ancestors.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.379
I saw him!

07:42.379 --> 07:44.590
Did you do what he says?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.258
No, Father!

07:47.050 --> 07:48.844
He did it.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.596
This is his plan...

07:50.596 --> 07:53.307
...to blame us. I know it!

07:54.349 --> 07:57.519
When my father finds out...

07:58.228 --> 08:00.856
...it will be war.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.193
We are at the edge of a precipice, Lord.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.657
If my son did this act...

08:12.701 --> 08:15.370
...then I myself will kill him...

08:15.954 --> 08:19.249
...so that the bond between our two tribes remains strong.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.127
Father!

08:22.294 --> 08:24.087
Be still, fool.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.679
If I sacrifice my son...

08:34.056 --> 08:36.350
...to the God of War...

08:36.975 --> 08:38.769
...would you consider the balance restored?

08:39.811 --> 08:43.565
Will it end your grievance against me and my kin...

08:45.442 --> 08:47.861
...for now and always?

08:49.613 --> 08:52.616
It is all right, Father.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.412
I did not do this thing...

08:59.790 --> 09:02.334
...but I embrace death, if it helps you.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.881
You make me proud that you are mine.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.140
Is it at an end?

09:17.849 --> 09:22.145
Will his death serve to bring us together, for all time...

09:23.647 --> 09:26.275
...as witnessed here by us all?

09:27.526 --> 09:28.402
Yes?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.948
Or is it no?

09:37.494 --> 09:41.540
No sacrifice can repair this insult to my ancestors.

09:43.208 --> 09:47.212
You are all responsible, and my father will hear of it.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.759
And when he does...

09:55.637 --> 10:00.976
...pray doom does not fall upon your heads.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.070
Brave warriors!

10:14.197 --> 10:17.367
War feeds our glory...

10:18.118 --> 10:22.039
...there is no place for peace.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.229
Do you want them followed?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.982
We could kill them in their sleep...

10:48.982 --> 10:51.985
...and feast on their flesh this very night.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.947
There has been a desecration.

10:57.449 --> 11:03.080
It was likely done by Wirepa himself...

11:04.831 --> 11:09.961
...a pretext for what is to come.

11:09.961 --> 11:14.216
If his father wants cause for war, he has it.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.636
There is nothing that will stop it now.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.851
Finally something honourable for a warrior to do.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.859
If you were not so stupid, boy...

11:32.859 --> 11:35.946
...I would thank you.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.639
I want to be a warrior.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.980
Is it not good to die in a great battle?

12:11.022 --> 12:14.276
Does it not honour our ancestors?

12:15.986 --> 12:19.448
To the east of here...

12:19.448 --> 12:23.869
...lies the place we call the Dead Lands.

12:25.203 --> 12:30.125
Once, a great tribe lived there...

12:31.376 --> 12:33.962
...but they disappeared.

12:35.672 --> 12:40.510
One day they were there, the next...

12:40.510 --> 12:43.013
...they were gone.

12:43.013 --> 12:49.770
A land without people, a dead place.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.233
I do not want that...

12:55.233 --> 12:58.028
...for our tribe.

13:26.056 --> 13:30.268
They sigh at us.

13:31.019 --> 13:38.026
The dead moan at us from the earth.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.448
We can hear them.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.829
We must heed their call...

13:48.829 --> 13:52.040
...listen to their sighs.

13:52.040 --> 13:57.546
We walk with our dead...

14:00.632 --> 14:05.428
...but we don't yet know it.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.290
Murder!

14:33.290 --> 14:34.749
Treachery!

17:03.273 --> 17:08.570
I underestimated you.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.911
You are truly your father's son.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.497
Yes.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.624
Before long...

17:22.083 --> 17:25.003
...your tribe will be no more.

17:25.003 --> 17:29.257
I will fill your daughter's uterus with dirt.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.803
And that will be your lineage forever...

17:35.930 --> 17:38.600
...dead earth.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.069
Indeed“.

17:51.112 --> 17:53.406
...you are a warrior, Tane.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.160
You will remember this face.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.623
I will stare at you from death...

18:01.956 --> 18:05.251
...and wait for you to join me.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.756
You, and all here...

18:11.549 --> 18:13.676
...are cursed.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.598
Well said.

18:20.391 --> 18:24.562
A glorious way to die.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.079
Slaughter the rest!

18:43.289 --> 18:46.835
We will eat our fill tonight.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.130
We take his head.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.717
You are cursed.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.220
<i>1 DRY You.</i>

19:44.642 --> 19:46.102
Did you find the boy?

19:47.478 --> 19:48.479
No.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.739
The boy fled.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.408
We leave.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.813
Our men are dead...

21:13.815 --> 21:17.068
...and they took your father's head.

21:18.945 --> 21:22.448
Where were you, boy?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.742
Look“.

21:25.827 --> 21:29.580
...see what you have done to our glorious people.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.670
Look!

22:02.322 --> 22:03.906
What plant is this?

22:15.168 --> 22:18.921
Wirepa has our father's head.

22:31.809 --> 22:35.104
Do you understand the lesson?

22:40.068 --> 22:43.946
Our ancestors scream at me for repayment.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.372
And what can you do?

22:52.914 --> 22:55.666
One against so many?

22:57.335 --> 23:01.130
I will get repayment alone...

23:01.130 --> 23:03.841
...or die seeking it.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.264
If I could...

23:10.264 --> 23:12.934
...I would kill Wirepa myself.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.484
But I cannot.

23:23.361 --> 23:26.030
And neither can you.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.788
If I do not return...

23:35.415 --> 23:38.251
...tell stories about me.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.396
We will cross here.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.315
That way is forbidden.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.317
It goes though the Dead Lands.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.945
So we'll move swiftly, then.

24:05.945 --> 24:09.699
Travelling through the Dead Lands saves us five clays.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.326
My lord...

24:13.035 --> 24:14.203
...Tahi is right.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.291
Those lands are forbidden...

24:18.291 --> 24:21.752
...we risk the wrath of its spirits.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.256
They say there is...

24:28.926 --> 24:30.178
...a monster.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.764
A monster who eats the flesh of anyone who passes...

24:33.764 --> 24:36.142
...who consumed a whole tribe.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.561
What do I care...

24:39.020 --> 24:40.813
...of monsters?

24:41.355 --> 24:43.608
Or the dead ancestors of this place?

24:45.067 --> 24:47.028
They will marvel at my glory!

24:48.488 --> 24:50.323
And the ghosts will hide from us.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.121
Yes, Lord.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.375
We go.

26:40.308 --> 26:41.559
Come here, boy.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.813
Don't you recognise me?

26:49.317 --> 26:53.154
The young have such short memories.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.325
I am your grandmother.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.790
I have never spoken with the dead before.

27:04.790 --> 27:09.211
I am proud of you.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.796
But...

27:11.797 --> 27:14.258
...you are a fool.

27:14.258 --> 27:18.346
What do you think you will do on your own?

27:19.889 --> 27:22.308
I will kill Wirepa.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.561
He will kill you.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.355
Stupid!

27:28.230 --> 27:31.150
I will not let it be so.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.446
I am my father's son.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.495
Then think, boy...

27:42.495 --> 27:46.040
...as your father would have.

27:51.212 --> 27:54.548
I know who can help us.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.351
The flesh-eating warrior who haunts these lands.

28:11.816 --> 28:15.903
There is something of your father in you after all.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.761
Why are you here, little one?

28:41.721 --> 28:44.682
Don't you know men who come here never leave?

28:45.850 --> 28:49.520
I am here to speak with the warrior who is said to live here.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.314
I am a chief.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.650
Is that right?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.736
A chief?

29:16.714 --> 29:19.175
Show these witches no fear...

29:19.842 --> 29:21.969
...or they will devour you.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.389
They feast on the blood of great warriors.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.813
This way, boy.

29:53.501 --> 29:56.003
What you seek is inside.

29:56.003 --> 29:59.340
Enter at your peril.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.403
How old are you, boy?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.957
Nearly sixteen seasons.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.459
You are a dwarf, then.

30:40.130 --> 30:44.009
Even small things can be useful...

30:46.470 --> 30:51.100
...and some large things not.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.820
You're funny.

31:03.988 --> 31:06.574
Perhaps I should hang you above the fire...

31:06.574 --> 31:09.535
...keep you as my entertainment.

31:10.703 --> 31:13.789
Or a tasty treat.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.548
What do you think?

31:24.049 --> 31:25.718
Nothing?

31:26.302 --> 31:29.847
I caught this fellow hunting on my lands.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.601
See what I did to him?

31:35.019 --> 31:38.647
Why aren't you laughing, boy?

31:49.533 --> 31:51.285
Why are you here?

31:53.203 --> 31:54.997
Tell me...

31:55.497 --> 31:57.499
...and I'll decide...

31:57.499 --> 32:03.130
...whether to kill you and eat you, or not.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.972
I follow a man...

32:12.556 --> 32:14.808
...he is called Wirepa.

32:15.351 --> 32:19.146
Even now he walks through your lands...

32:19.146 --> 32:21.899
...as if you do not exist.

32:33.577 --> 32:34.995
Be quiet!

32:35.996 --> 32:38.374
Mind those wives of mine, boy.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.920
You know what they are doing?

32:43.963 --> 32:46.048
They eat these mushrooms...

32:47.466 --> 32:50.552
...and their heads fill with visions...

32:51.512 --> 32:55.683
...and they talk to the dead.

32:59.311 --> 33:03.190
Finish your story then...

33:06.151 --> 33:10.155
...and we'll see if I eat you.

33:25.462 --> 33:26.755
What is it?

33:28.048 --> 33:30.050
A lizard on my staff...

33:30.050 --> 33:32.094
...it is a bad omen.

33:33.637 --> 33:35.597
Or not.

33:36.932 --> 33:40.602
I told you we would be cursed.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.396
This is proof.

33:42.396 --> 33:45.065
The creature has polluted my weapon.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.943
I cannot use it now.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.988
We must leave this place.

33:53.407 --> 33:54.825
Fool!

33:54.825 --> 33:56.785
It is a genuine omen.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.912
We are cursed...

33:59.705 --> 34:01.457
...that is what it says.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.255
You can hear it talk, can you?

34:13.677 --> 34:15.721
Sleep.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.224
Tomorrow we move on...

34:19.224 --> 34:22.811
...and all will be as before.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.533
The boy reminds you of your own dishonour...

34:37.701 --> 34:39.745
...that much is plain.

34:48.796 --> 34:52.508
You won't escape this life so easily.

34:54.051 --> 34:59.098
Until you die, I cannot kill myself.

34:59.098 --> 35:03.685
I am trapped in this dishonour with you.

35:05.813 --> 35:08.607
Seeing you suffer...

35:08.607 --> 35:13.153
...is the only pleasure left to me.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.791
Help the boy.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.253
Why?

35:29.962 --> 35:33.423
Give his blood to your ancestors.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.554
Ask their forgiveness...

35:38.554 --> 35:42.266
...so that you might join them in the afterlife.

35:42.266 --> 35:44.726
And then we both can die.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.983
Stupid woman!

35:52.067 --> 35:54.987
You think a dwarf's blood...

35:55.654 --> 35:58.657
...will make them forgive me for what I have clone?

35:58.657 --> 35:59.825
Yes!

36:01.076 --> 36:04.037
Because he is a prize.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.169
He is a prize!

36:13.338 --> 36:16.633
Because he is everything...

36:19.178 --> 36:21.722
...that you are not.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.821
We are going south...

36:37.821 --> 36:39.781
...leaving this place.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.662
Good.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.666
I do not want to share my glory with you.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.127
Go.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.135
Well...

37:00.135 --> 37:02.930
...anyone else want to go with them?

37:02.930 --> 37:05.182
No? Then move.

37:05.182 --> 37:08.268
There is no glory lying here.

37:11.271 --> 37:15.442
I feel there is something wrong, with these lands.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.281
So what of it?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.785
The spirits cry at us...

37:24.785 --> 37:28.580
...and yet, what can they do?

37:29.581 --> 37:31.458
Curse us?

37:34.878 --> 37:38.924
It is they who were cursed...

37:41.718 --> 37:44.012
...not us.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.664
We should rest.

38:57.002 --> 38:57.753
The monster!

38:58.045 --> 38:58.795
Run!

39:02.883 --> 39:05.635
The fat one should be slow enough for you!

39:23.111 --> 39:25.113
Bravado is pointless...

39:25.947 --> 39:28.033
...look where it got you!

39:36.249 --> 39:37.751
Ah, the novice.

39:38.919 --> 39:39.920
Come here!

40:01.441 --> 40:03.652
Die nobly!

40:03.652 --> 40:07.239
Come on boy, don't tickle him!

40:16.206 --> 40:18.041
Watch this.

40:21.169 --> 40:24.339
Greet your ancestors from me.

40:47.571 --> 40:50.699
You weren't very good today.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.578
In fact, you were hopeless.

41:03.086 --> 41:08.008
But next time, you'll be better.

41:11.928 --> 41:15.265
My father was right.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.436
He knew I was no warrior.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.856
You don't say.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.402
His death...

41:29.321 --> 41:32.324
...was not a noble one.

41:32.908 --> 41:35.785
How else should he have died?

41:37.537 --> 41:41.041
Like an animal, crawling away in the forest?

41:41.917 --> 41:44.878
Is that how a warrior should die?

41:46.505 --> 41:50.050
He fought, he died.

41:50.592 --> 41:52.344
Noble?

41:53.136 --> 41:56.139
That is what old men teach boys...

41:56.139 --> 42:00.519
...so they will rush into death for their tribes.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.438
But death is not noble.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.483
Nor is life.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.027
If you ask me...

42:09.027 --> 42:12.739
...the gods have made this life...

42:12.739 --> 42:15.242
...to take pleasure in our suffering.

42:22.374 --> 42:24.251
Tough meat...

42:28.129 --> 42:31.132
...hardly worth the effort.

42:51.027 --> 42:53.989
You are getting worse.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.701
Come, I'll show you something.

42:59.369 --> 43:04.457
Your opponents will thank you for a cleaner kill.

43:07.711 --> 43:09.129
First...

43:10.005 --> 43:12.882
...make them angry.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.263
They lose focus.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.767
Make a joke about their mother...

43:23.351 --> 43:25.061
...that usually works for me.

43:26.146 --> 43:28.023
Now, come at me.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.446
Right here.

43:35.864 --> 43:39.534
As hard as you can.

43:39.534 --> 43:43.038
Their legs go like runny shit!

43:43.038 --> 43:45.248
Then here, see?

43:48.043 --> 43:51.046
Always keep the cord around your wrist...

43:52.422 --> 43:55.550
...then it won't slip when you come down hard.

43:57.844 --> 44:00.055
You try.

44:04.601 --> 44:05.977
I said do it!

44:06.436 --> 44:08.355
Don't tickle me...

44:08.355 --> 44:10.065
...I don't like it!

44:11.816 --> 44:13.234
Again.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.953
That's better!

44:24.287 --> 44:27.749
Fire in the eyes now, eh boy?

44:29.959 --> 44:32.629
You just needed a little encouragement.

44:33.380 --> 44:34.839
Again!

44:43.056 --> 44:45.433
Not bad.

44:46.142 --> 44:49.020
Not very good either...

44:49.020 --> 44:52.107
...but maybe enough.

44:55.402 --> 44:57.445
Now sleep.

44:57.987 --> 45:01.491
Tomorrow we run all clay.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.497
Follow me, now.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.457
Move!

46:35.752 --> 46:37.295
They're getting away!

46:37.712 --> 46:39.506
That's what you think.

47:00.819 --> 47:02.195
Run.

47:02.195 --> 47:04.280
Remember what I taught you!

47:32.559 --> 47:35.061
Where is the boy?

47:35.061 --> 47:37.897
So you like boys, eh?

47:42.110 --> 47:44.904
Before you die...

47:44.904 --> 47:47.490
...the boy's father...

47:49.075 --> 47:51.119
...wishes you well...

47:51.119 --> 47:55.373
...and encourages me to spare you no pain.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.750
Find the boy.

47:58.418 --> 48:00.003
Now.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.173
Brave warriors...

48:04.173 --> 48:05.633
...get ready!

48:09.804 --> 48:11.347
Where are you?

48:15.935 --> 48:17.896
Kill this dog!

48:45.632 --> 48:48.426
It is him!

48:48.968 --> 48:51.721
The monster in the flesh.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.392
Indeed it is.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.047
Come, little one.

49:26.839 --> 49:30.093
I'll teach you a lesson.

49:30.677 --> 49:32.136
Your mother mates with clogs!

50:21.436 --> 50:22.895
Dog!

51:29.212 --> 51:30.671
Move!

51:57.240 --> 51:59.951
Is that all you can do?

52:01.369 --> 52:05.206
You must earn the right to dispatch us!

52:13.297 --> 52:14.715
He is a demon!

52:14.715 --> 52:16.384
Lord...

52:16.384 --> 52:18.511
...you have been compromised!

52:25.101 --> 52:26.144
Let's go!

52:32.525 --> 52:34.068
Cowards!

52:34.610 --> 52:37.738
Hunt what's in front of you, eh?

52:56.007 --> 52:57.925
You can't kill me...

53:01.345 --> 53:04.432
...I'm dead already.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.437
Am I not?

53:43.512 --> 53:45.640
Leave me be!

53:45.640 --> 53:47.141
What is it?

53:48.601 --> 53:51.729
They are judging me-

53:55.524 --> 53:57.526
They cannot.

53:58.069 --> 54:01.072
They are my ancestors.

54:06.535 --> 54:11.791
They judge me.

54:29.016 --> 54:32.019
Am I not dead?

54:33.771 --> 54:35.731
You will live.

55:05.678 --> 55:08.097
What is it, boy?

55:08.806 --> 55:12.059
Why didn't you tell me...

55:12.059 --> 55:14.895
...these were your tribe's lands?

55:15.354 --> 55:17.440
What is it to you?

55:19.191 --> 55:21.235
What does it matter at all?

55:23.612 --> 55:26.615
They're all gone.

55:29.327 --> 55:31.787
They are your ancestors...

55:32.163 --> 55:34.457
...you should honour them.

55:34.457 --> 55:37.043
You know nothing.

55:38.044 --> 55:41.422
You are the last of your people.

55:51.140 --> 55:54.310
Then we are the same, eh?

56:00.483 --> 56:03.611
All I want is Wirepa.

56:03.611 --> 56:06.030
We need to do something.

56:06.989 --> 56:09.116
Like what?

56:09.116 --> 56:12.703
We can't catch them now.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.506
We are surrounded by your ancestors.

56:26.842 --> 56:29.303
They will slow Wirepa down.

56:31.472 --> 56:33.974
I won't.

56:35.518 --> 56:37.686
You will.

56:39.980 --> 56:43.109
I'm not eating those.

56:43.442 --> 56:45.194
Yes you are.

56:45.903 --> 56:49.407
You will talk to your ancestors.

56:50.950 --> 56:55.287
Ask them to slow Wirepa down.

56:56.956 --> 56:59.458
Why don't you then...

57:01.210 --> 57:03.295
...if it's such a good idea.

57:04.255 --> 57:06.215
This is your land.

57:06.966 --> 57:08.843
These are your ancestors.

57:13.097 --> 57:15.558
Why are you afraid?

57:24.984 --> 57:27.736
They will not speak to me.

57:35.578 --> 57:37.872
If Wirepa gets away...

57:37.872 --> 57:41.792
...he will have beaten you as well as me.

58:01.437 --> 58:04.356
What difference...

58:04.356 --> 58:07.151
...does it make to you...

58:07.151 --> 58:10.070
...dead things?

58:14.909 --> 58:20.915
They moan, our ancestors...

58:22.875 --> 58:27.004
...they call to us.

58:28.172 --> 58:33.344
The dead are calling...

58:34.512 --> 58:43.395
...pleading for revenge, and we heed them.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.755
Where are you going, you two?

59:11.507 --> 59:14.093
Will they help us?

59:26.063 --> 59:29.108
They already have.

59:29.483 --> 59:33.070
We have angered the ancestors of this place...

59:33.070 --> 59:36.907
...they are punishing us for coming here.

59:36.907 --> 59:41.287
Your fear will not stop my glory.

59:45.499 --> 59:48.043
Do you hear me?

1:00:04.685 --> 1:00:07.271
He truly is a demon.

1:00:09.023 --> 1:00:10.691
He is glorious!

1:00:11.150 --> 1:00:13.277
You don't deserve to fight him.

1:00:13.277 --> 1:00:14.862
Faster.

1:00:14.862 --> 1:00:16.780
Cursed, are we?

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:19.950
And yet the ground opens up to hide us.

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:22.411
Mother earth is alive!

1:01:06.789 --> 1:01:08.791
Where are you going, you two?

1:01:15.881 --> 1:01:18.300
We were travelling with companions...

1:01:18.300 --> 1:01:21.178
...but became lost.

1:01:21.178 --> 1:01:23.305
You might have seen them?

1:01:27.810 --> 1:01:29.645
We've seen no one.

1:01:32.147 --> 1:01:34.191
You're hurt.

1:01:36.610 --> 1:01:39.655
My father fell...

1:01:39.655 --> 1:01:42.991
...but I nursed him back to health.

1:01:46.787 --> 1:01:49.707
I welcome you, little brother...

1:01:49.707 --> 1:01:53.836
...to share our camp for the night.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:59.133
Thank you, we will.

1:02:01.135 --> 1:02:04.054
He doesn't talk much does he, your father?

1:02:09.268 --> 1:02:11.687
What are you doing?

1:02:11.687 --> 1:02:14.440
We should kill them.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:17.860
I've no argument with them.

1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:19.903
Then we should leave.

1:02:19.903 --> 1:02:24.074
I thought you wanted to find Wirepa.

1:02:24.074 --> 1:02:26.744
What does it matter to you?

1:02:26.744 --> 1:02:30.080
You said to carry on was hopeless.

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:35.544
Why are you sad, little brother?

1:02:36.879 --> 1:02:38.839
I miss my family.

1:02:40.549 --> 1:02:42.885
But you're with your father.

1:02:44.928 --> 1:02:47.765
The rest of my family.

1:02:56.356 --> 1:02:59.193
I don't think he is your father.

1:03:04.198 --> 1:03:05.949
Yes he is.

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:10.704
Perhaps we should take you back with us.

1:03:10.704 --> 1:03:14.041
My father would find out the truth.

1:03:14.708 --> 1:03:17.377
It would do you no good.

1:03:36.522 --> 1:03:39.316
I know one thing...

1:03:43.111 --> 1:03:46.114
...you are indeed a proud and brave warrior.

1:04:50.929 --> 1:04:52.973
The boy confessed...

1:04:52.973 --> 1:04:55.517
...you are not his father.

1:04:55.934 --> 1:04:57.686
Stupid boy!

1:04:58.562 --> 1:05:00.856
I might have known.

1:05:04.902 --> 1:05:08.906
People don't enter the Dead Lands unless they have to.

1:05:08.906 --> 1:05:11.742
Unless they are very desperate.

1:05:18.290 --> 1:05:20.918
Why are you here then?

1:05:20.918 --> 1:05:24.129
Our own lands are empty of birds.

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:29.134
You should try eating less.

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:34.514
And what is it you want here...

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:37.309
...warrior?

1:05:46.485 --> 1:05:48.570
Who are you?

1:05:51.365 --> 1:05:53.325
Tell me.

1:05:58.664 --> 1:06:01.875
Tell me who it is I'm touching.

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:22.896
So much pain this body has seen.

1:06:30.779 --> 1:06:34.866
Has it seen many noble deeds...

1:06:34.866 --> 1:06:37.202
...great warrior?

1:06:40.122 --> 1:06:44.042
Keep going...

1:06:45.627 --> 1:06:48.797
...and I may yet tell you my name.

1:07:04.104 --> 1:07:07.649
You bear the mark of the dead tribe.

1:07:13.238 --> 1:07:15.449
Don't touch me!

1:07:33.216 --> 1:07:35.385
Yes.

1:07:37.054 --> 1:07:39.931
Your tribe will be no more.

1:07:39.931 --> 1:07:43.185
You will disappear like mist.

1:08:17.511 --> 1:08:20.263
Come then, monster...

1:08:21.098 --> 1:08:24.434
...if it is death you want.

1:09:26.246 --> 1:09:28.540
Don't! Please!

1:09:54.441 --> 1:09:56.610
You should not have come here.

1:10:52.999 --> 1:10:54.209
Why?

1:10:58.838 --> 1:11:00.548
Why would you do this?

1:11:01.091 --> 1:11:04.552
What are you, a demon?

1:11:04.552 --> 1:11:06.846
Are you even a man at all?

1:11:07.347 --> 1:11:11.434
She would have told them.

1:11:13.144 --> 1:11:14.604
What?

1:11:15.897 --> 1:11:19.859
That I exist.

1:11:21.152 --> 1:11:25.448
They would know I am but a man...

1:11:28.326 --> 1:11:31.329
...and come to take my lands.

1:11:33.957 --> 1:11:36.001
I know who you are...

1:11:37.085 --> 1:11:40.922
...why do you not kill me?

1:12:02.902 --> 1:12:05.613
I told you boy...

1:12:09.117 --> 1:12:11.536
...I told you.

1:12:12.412 --> 1:12:15.790
I was not honourable, I told you!

1:12:15.790 --> 1:12:18.335
I said we should go!

1:12:18.752 --> 1:12:21.254
This is your fault.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:23.340
Liar!

1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:26.092
Careful, boy.

1:12:30.722 --> 1:12:32.515
You're an animal!

1:12:33.892 --> 1:12:40.106
Not noble enough for you?

1:12:41.066 --> 1:12:43.610
Not like you are.

1:12:43.902 --> 1:12:47.739
My father taught me honour.

1:12:47.739 --> 1:12:50.617
You should restore your own.

1:12:51.743 --> 1:12:55.246
And where is your father now?

1:12:55.246 --> 1:12:58.958
Where your people are.

1:13:06.424 --> 1:13:11.388
You want to know about honour, boy?

1:13:17.727 --> 1:13:21.773
My father asked me...

1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:26.403
...to slay my whole family.

1:13:28.113 --> 1:13:30.615
My wife...

1:13:33.326 --> 1:13:36.496
...my children.

1:13:37.831 --> 1:13:40.959
As repayment to an enemy.

1:13:41.793 --> 1:13:45.130
I did it, to honour him...

1:13:45.130 --> 1:13:48.049
...and my tribe.

1:13:53.346 --> 1:13:56.891
But the world is not honourable, boy.

1:13:56.891 --> 1:14:01.312
Did the betrayal of your father teach you nothing?

1:14:03.064 --> 1:14:05.400
Do you hear me?

1:14:06.568 --> 1:14:10.405
There is no nobility, just politics.

1:14:17.871 --> 1:14:19.539
So...

1:14:25.253 --> 1:14:29.382
...I killed everybody else, too.

1:14:38.558 --> 1:14:41.352
I killed them all...

1:14:41.352 --> 1:14:43.521
...in the night.

1:14:45.565 --> 1:14:48.485
While they slept.

1:14:52.238 --> 1:14:56.451
That is why people fear me.

1:14:58.119 --> 1:15:03.249
The monster who killed his own tribe.

1:15:10.548 --> 1:15:13.468
Do you hear me?

1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:20.058
Do you hear?

1:15:21.351 --> 1:15:24.229
I admit it!

1:15:30.193 --> 1:15:34.364
I have a blackness that comes upon me...

1:15:34.364 --> 1:15:38.868
...where even the God of War would not venture.

1:15:44.749 --> 1:15:48.711
I've clone many bad things.

1:15:51.548 --> 1:15:53.883
I told you...

1:15:54.759 --> 1:15:58.096
...do not mistake me for a good man.

1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:06.479
I am not the hero from the stories.

1:16:12.694 --> 1:16:15.446
I am the monster.

1:17:07.999 --> 1:17:13.921
You've clone well so far, eh boy?

1:17:17.925 --> 1:17:20.720
You're still alive.

1:17:22.805 --> 1:17:25.725
I have failed.

1:17:27.935 --> 1:17:30.521
Wirepa got away.

1:17:32.190 --> 1:17:34.942
Well, you can give up...

1:17:36.277 --> 1:17:39.489
...anyone can give up.

1:17:40.406 --> 1:17:42.158
I didn't say I was giving up.

1:17:44.285 --> 1:17:46.204
That's good.

1:17:53.711 --> 1:17:57.757
I want repayment for what happened to my son...

1:18:00.009 --> 1:18:03.346
...and you are the only one who can get it.

1:18:54.397 --> 1:18:57.859
Why do you stare at me?

1:19:01.779 --> 1:19:04.449
What right do you have...

1:19:05.742 --> 1:19:08.244
...to stare at me?

1:19:14.250 --> 1:19:16.335
How dare you?

1:19:18.004 --> 1:19:20.548
Sigh at me not!

1:20:19.106 --> 1:20:23.194
I have something to show you.

1:20:33.538 --> 1:20:34.455
There...

1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:36.415
...see it?

1:20:38.167 --> 1:20:41.504
There will be more flesh tonight.

1:20:44.215 --> 1:20:48.886
Now we can settle up.

1:21:10.449 --> 1:21:11.659
They will see it.

1:21:11.659 --> 1:21:13.244
Fool!

1:21:13.578 --> 1:21:15.580
You talk of fools?

1:21:17.748 --> 1:21:21.252
Who set the ancestors of this land against us?

1:21:24.672 --> 1:21:26.465
And dragged us through it...

1:21:27.675 --> 1:21:29.093
...with empty bellies!

1:21:41.981 --> 1:21:43.274
He's a fool...

1:21:44.191 --> 1:21:45.902
...but no need to kill him.

1:21:46.777 --> 1:21:49.280
Why are we here?

1:21:51.157 --> 1:21:53.242
You could not go on...

1:21:53.242 --> 1:21:55.369
...so we took shelter.

1:21:55.369 --> 1:21:56.996
It's defendable.

1:22:06.505 --> 1:22:08.549
Are you ready to travel?

1:22:26.817 --> 1:22:29.278
Fight him when you control the ground.

1:22:37.536 --> 1:22:38.537
Back inside the fort!

1:22:51.634 --> 1:22:52.927
Cowards!

1:22:56.514 --> 1:22:58.224
It was glory you wanted.

1:22:59.058 --> 1:23:00.685
Come then...

1:23:02.603 --> 1:23:05.439
...and I will tell stories about how brave you were.

1:23:06.273 --> 1:23:10.236
Instead of hiding behind a fence like cowards!

1:23:21.956 --> 1:23:26.085
Look upon your son, Tane.

1:23:28.170 --> 1:23:30.381
The weeping dwarf...

1:23:30.381 --> 1:23:32.466
...who caused your tribe's suffering.

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:54.780
You are funny.

1:23:55.156 --> 1:23:57.324
So brave, eh...

1:23:57.783 --> 1:24:00.745
...behind a fence?

1:24:02.663 --> 1:24:05.708
Behind my fence.

1:24:27.063 --> 1:24:27.980
Glory...

1:24:28.898 --> 1:24:30.274
...or death.

1:24:30.274 --> 1:24:31.776
Either way...

1:24:32.526 --> 1:24:35.321
...you'll make a handsome corpse, eh boy?

1:24:36.906 --> 1:24:40.326
We will die here without water.

1:24:41.285 --> 1:24:42.953
Be still.

1:24:42.953 --> 1:24:45.122
It's only been a day.

1:24:45.664 --> 1:24:47.541
Just one clay, yes...

1:24:51.212 --> 1:24:53.339
...but my mouth is filled with nothing but dust!

1:24:55.883 --> 1:24:57.843
Mana is right.

1:24:57.843 --> 1:24:59.637
We have no supplies.

1:24:59.637 --> 1:25:02.056
You have put us in a trap.

1:25:02.348 --> 1:25:05.643
Remember your place.

1:25:05.643 --> 1:25:08.312
So it's our place...

1:25:09.313 --> 1:25:11.482
...to die of thirst?

1:25:12.733 --> 1:25:15.277
They have no food or water.

1:25:15.778 --> 1:25:17.738
We have them.

1:25:19.448 --> 1:25:20.950
Your quest for glory...

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:24.036
...where has it led us?

1:25:25.663 --> 1:25:27.957
Into this trap...

1:25:29.792 --> 1:25:31.877
...from which there is no escape!

1:25:31.877 --> 1:25:35.673
We wither here until the demon sees fit to consume us.

1:25:36.465 --> 1:25:37.800
Settle down!

1:25:46.433 --> 1:25:47.601
Come and look...

1:25:47.601 --> 1:25:50.980
You are not your father.

1:25:53.232 --> 1:25:54.441
Lord...

1:25:54.441 --> 1:25:56.068
You are a fool!

1:26:00.656 --> 1:26:02.408
There!

1:26:03.284 --> 1:26:05.619
Let his blood sustain us.

1:26:19.466 --> 1:26:20.551
Lord...

1:26:22.219 --> 1:26:23.762
...look.

1:26:33.564 --> 1:26:35.399
What did I tell you?

1:26:36.150 --> 1:26:39.612
The ancestors of this place choose me.

1:26:51.957 --> 1:26:54.043
I will make the boy's head...

1:26:54.543 --> 1:26:56.003
...a match with his father's.

1:26:58.839 --> 1:27:02.384
The gods smile on me...

1:27:02.384 --> 1:27:05.429
...and I am like a son to them.

1:27:16.232 --> 1:27:17.358
There!

1:28:03.279 --> 1:28:04.947
My warriors...

1:28:05.197 --> 1:28:06.448
...we leave!

1:28:20.421 --> 1:28:21.463
There!

1:28:24.967 --> 1:28:26.677
Cowards!

1:28:26.677 --> 1:28:28.095
Come, boy...

1:28:29.930 --> 1:28:31.598
...time to claim what's yours.

1:28:38.814 --> 1:28:40.399
Come on, boy!

1:28:56.832 --> 1:28:58.876
Stupid boy!

1:29:23.734 --> 1:29:26.445
You're afraid, aren't you.

1:29:29.323 --> 1:29:31.158
I am so glorious...

1:29:31.158 --> 1:29:33.369
...that is what you're in awe of.

1:29:53.222 --> 1:29:55.599
The monster's spirit...

1:29:55.599 --> 1:29:58.769
...and these dead lands have possessed you.

1:29:59.144 --> 1:30:01.146
So be it.

1:30:03.148 --> 1:30:04.191
No mercy!

1:30:53.699 --> 1:30:55.075
Come on, boy!

1:30:58.162 --> 1:31:00.622
You're embarrassing me!

1:31:02.958 --> 1:31:05.961
Put up a decent fight!

1:32:49.189 --> 1:32:50.816
I am your better...

1:32:52.234 --> 1:32:54.570
...and now you know it.

1:33:11.295 --> 1:33:13.255
Pick it up, demon...

1:33:13.255 --> 1:33:15.966
...I will honour you with a good death.

1:33:50.459 --> 1:33:52.336
Go!

1:33:53.003 --> 1:33:55.255
Go to your father.

1:34:13.899 --> 1:34:17.194
You are a fool to honour me.

1:34:17.194 --> 1:34:19.863
Tell the dead...

1:34:21.365 --> 1:34:24.326
...I am coming.

1:34:53.814 --> 1:34:57.025
The demon is but a man, after all.

1:34:58.652 --> 1:34:59.986
No!

1:35:38.233 --> 1:35:41.027
Glorious...

1:35:41.445 --> 1:35:44.906
...as your father before you.

1:35:48.869 --> 1:35:51.913
You will pay for the slaughter of my family.

1:35:51.913 --> 1:35:54.583
As it should be!

1:35:54.583 --> 1:35:58.378
Your father will be proud...

1:35:58.378 --> 1:36:01.840
...just as mine is proud of me.

1:36:03.467 --> 1:36:06.428
Tell them how I met death.

1:36:06.803 --> 1:36:07.929
Promise me!

1:36:07.929 --> 1:36:10.140
And if I do...

1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:11.975
...what then?

1:36:14.853 --> 1:36:18.523
Your kin will seek repayment for your death.

1:36:19.691 --> 1:36:24.237
They will tell of our glory...

1:36:24.237 --> 1:36:27.908
...and remember us in stories.

1:36:27.908 --> 1:36:30.577
You didn't have to kill them all!

1:36:33.455 --> 1:36:36.958
How could I live with the dishonour...

1:36:37.584 --> 1:36:42.214
...of my kin lying unburied?

1:36:43.673 --> 1:36:46.760
I have given them glory.

1:36:48.345 --> 1:36:53.433
Just as you will do when you kill me.

1:36:55.101 --> 1:36:57.729
So it goes, then...

1:37:00.816 --> 1:37:03.860
...around in circles.

1:37:08.281 --> 1:37:11.159
When you think of me...

1:37:12.369 --> 1:37:15.121
...you will remember how I spared you.

1:37:15.121 --> 1:37:17.916
And that forever...

1:37:18.625 --> 1:37:21.545
...you owe me a debt.

1:37:21.545 --> 1:37:25.173
The debt lies with you...

1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:29.261
...your father...

1:37:29.261 --> 1:37:31.513
...and your tribe.

1:37:31.930 --> 1:37:33.849
For all time.

1:37:35.684 --> 1:37:37.811
Do you swear?

1:37:41.231 --> 1:37:42.816
Swear.

1:37:46.736 --> 1:37:48.154
Say it!

1:37:48.154 --> 1:37:50.031
I swear.

1:37:51.199 --> 1:37:52.784
On your honour...

1:37:52.784 --> 1:37:54.786
...and that of your father.

1:37:55.871 --> 1:37:57.497
I swear it.

1:37:59.207 --> 1:38:02.794
Then the ancestors of this place...

1:38:03.587 --> 1:38:06.298
...are my witness.

1:38:46.838 --> 1:38:49.090
Stupid boy...

1:38:53.094 --> 1:38:57.641
...let me die in peace.

1:39:02.020 --> 1:39:06.191
I can see them, boy...

1:39:10.695 --> 1:39:14.324
...my ancestors.

1:39:16.201 --> 1:39:20.038
They reject me.

1:39:20.956 --> 1:39:28.964
They banish me from the afterlife.

1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:37.639
I have nowhere to go now.

1:39:42.644 --> 1:39:46.189
You will be welcomed by my ancestors.

1:39:46.481 --> 1:39:49.192
Do you hear me?

1:39:49.192 --> 1:39:52.654
They will lead you into the afterlife.

1:39:54.072 --> 1:39:57.909
And we will speak of you in stories.

1:40:00.286 --> 1:40:03.623
Speak of your honour.
