00:07.875 --> 00:10.611
- More salad, Phoebe?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.680
Phoebe?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.315
- [cell phone rings]
- Phoebe.

00:14.415 --> 00:15.449
- Hello?

00:15.549 --> 00:18.486
- Mom wants to know
if you want more salad.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.621
- Why didn't she just ask me?

00:23.524 --> 00:26.327
Sorry... I was just chirping
my friends on Chirper.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.363
- Phoebs, you're confusing Mom.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.633
- No, she's not--I chirp
my friends all the time.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.968
We're all, like, "Chirp,
chirp, girlfriend!"

00:37.971 --> 00:41.409
- See, Mom, Chirper is
a social networking site.

00:41.509 --> 00:45.146
Let me back up--
this is a cell phone.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.714
- [car horn honks]

00:46.814 --> 00:48.782
- Hey, I know that honk!

00:51.018 --> 00:53.554
The Thundervan!
- NORA: Cool!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.956
- Yup, got this old
crime-fighting machine

00:56.056 --> 00:58.926
out of storage from Metroburg.
- Oh, yeah?

00:59.026 --> 01:01.129
Your father and I chirped
up a lot of memories

01:01.229 --> 01:03.197
in this swag wagon.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.568
- Mom... don't.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.138
- I gave this baby
a new security system,

01:10.171 --> 01:13.040
and so the non-supe's
think it's a normal van,

01:13.141 --> 01:16.377
I got a state-of -the-art
cloaking device.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.647
[chuckles]

01:24.518 --> 01:25.753
Huh?

01:25.853 --> 01:29.890
- Wow, Dad... where'd
the Thundervan go?

01:30.658 --> 01:32.460
- Come on, let's go for a ride.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.961
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:34.061 --> 01:37.365
the Thundervan is full of
dangerous weapons and gadgets.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.968
- Yeahhhh!
- Nooooo!

01:41.068 --> 01:43.171
This van is off-limits
to you kids.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.339
I only brought it home
so Phoebe could start

01:45.439 --> 01:48.008
her next level of superhero
training.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.610
- Wait, for real?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.012
I thought Thundervan
training started next year.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.748
- Hero University is offering
an early admissions test.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.884
If you ace it, you
could be a full supe

01:56.984 --> 01:59.487
before Max can
grow a mustache.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.191
- Hey, Max-stache is coming in.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.494
- Just think Phoebe, you could
drop the normal teen act

02:06.594 --> 02:09.663
and be who you were born to be.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.031
- I'll tell you where
I was born to be--

02:11.199 --> 02:13.601
in the driver's seat
of that meat wagon.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.002
- Give me the keys, Hank-yo.

02:15.102 --> 02:17.238
- Unh-unh... once you're
over your evil phase,

02:17.338 --> 02:19.106
then we'll talk.
- It's not a phase!

02:19.207 --> 02:20.874
- Then we're done talking.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.110
- Oh, you just got chirped, son.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.579
Wh-what!

02:25.679 --> 02:28.482
- Barb, don't.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.984
- *

02:31.084 --> 02:33.987
- WOMAN: * What you see
is not what you get *

02:34.087 --> 02:37.225
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:37.291 --> 02:40.494
* We fit right in,
bet you never guessed *

02:40.594 --> 02:43.664
* Living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:43.764 --> 02:47.235
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:47.335 --> 02:50.638
* Look closer, you might
see the crazy things we do *

02:50.738 --> 02:53.674
* This isn't make-believe,
it's our reality *

02:53.774 --> 02:56.710
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:56.810 --> 02:58.512
* And stay out of trouble

02:58.612 --> 03:02.049
* Living a double life

03:07.988 --> 03:10.924
- Are we still training or
is Nora having a play date?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.127
- [scoffs] You don't
train in the Thundervan

03:14.262 --> 03:16.630
until you first practice
here in our...

03:16.730 --> 03:18.699
- ...play date.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.335
- Here, follow
along in the manual.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.272
- [thud]

03:24.305 --> 03:26.574
- We'll work
on the balance later.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.077
But first, this
is your driver's seat

03:30.177 --> 03:32.280
and these are
your navigation controls.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.282
- [toys squeaking]
- [laughing]

03:36.484 --> 03:38.786
Continue.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.389
- Your high-tech crime-fighting
center is in the back.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.592
Now to go from the front to
the back quickly, you swivel.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.295
- Got it--swivel.
- Yeah, swivel!

03:47.361 --> 03:49.763
Faster... swivel.
- Swivel!

03:49.863 --> 03:52.566
- Sorry to interrupt
your play date...

03:52.666 --> 03:54.101
- [cell phone chirping]

03:54.201 --> 03:55.936
- ...but Phoebe's phone
is going crazy.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.639
She's getting chirped
on the chirper.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.741
I mean, hash tag, am I right?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.312
- Mom, don't.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.516
Ooh, uh, Cherry's mom
is driving all our friends

04:08.616 --> 04:11.084
to the midnight show of "Last
Teen Mission to Space Part II."

04:11.184 --> 04:12.886
Can I go?
- At midnight tonight?

04:12.986 --> 04:14.455
No way!
- I know, right?

04:14.555 --> 04:17.157
- No, I mean, "No way."

04:17.325 --> 04:18.892
- But Dad, my friends
and I have seen

04:18.992 --> 04:21.595
"Last Teen Mission to Space
Part I" like a million times.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.064
I can't miss Part II--
everyone I know is going.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.199
- Aww, she's got a point, Hank.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.035
- But if you stay
out late tonight,

04:28.135 --> 04:30.070
you'll be too exhausted
to train tomorrow.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.506
- He's got a point, Phoebe.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.042
Not helping... got it.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.445
- Your early admissions
test is in a week.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.347
- Wait, a week...
that's so soon!

04:39.413 --> 04:40.948
- If you don't know your
superhero vehicle

04:41.048 --> 04:43.050
inside and out,
you'll fail.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.018
You don't want to fail, do you?

04:45.118 --> 04:48.021
- Course not...
that's Max's thing.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.924
- Exactly... that's
why you're not going.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.726
You've been preparing
for this your whole life.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.695
So you miss the movie tonight.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.498
Someday they'll make
a movie about you.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.968
- Long as it's not a flop
like somebody's movie.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.671
- Hey, "Thunderpants
the Musical"

05:03.771 --> 05:06.507
paid for this house.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.543
- All right, fine, I'll
stay home and study.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.414
Where'd that Thundervan
manual go?

05:13.514 --> 05:16.684
- Max, stop learning.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.388
- It was worth it
just to hear you say that.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.022
- I'll take that.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.493
Whoa!
[thud]

05:25.593 --> 05:28.061
- Hope that's in your movie.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.303
- Please take me with you, Max.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.106
I would do anything for
a joyride in the Thundervan.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.443
- No can do, Colosso,
but I got you this guy

05:42.543 --> 05:45.546
to keep you company.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.415
- A stuffed bear?

05:47.448 --> 05:48.849
What am I, a child?

05:48.949 --> 05:52.786
- No, you whine
way more than a child.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.424
- [whining] I do not!

05:56.490 --> 05:59.793
- You'll be fine--
just use your imagination.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.128
- Fine.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.465
I'll imagine you care.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.568
Like I'm gonna
play with some toy.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.605
Hmm...

06:11.705 --> 06:15.509
Okay, I'm intrepid explorer
Colosso Beauregard,

06:15.609 --> 06:19.880
and you're my faithful
sidekick Teddy Stuffington.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.484
Today we conquer Mt. Everest!

06:23.584 --> 06:26.987
- [dramatic music]

06:32.626 --> 06:35.863
- No, I love you more!

06:35.963 --> 06:38.466
- Why do I have parents who
enjoy each other's company?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.367
Just go to bed already!

06:40.468 --> 06:42.903
- You know, I should
probably take out the trash.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.473
- You're going
outside like that?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.775
- Yeah, I'll be so fast
no one's gonna see me.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.510
Time me!

06:54.347 --> 06:56.049
Like a human cheetah!

06:58.385 --> 06:59.920
How'd I do?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.321
- Super fast, baby.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.790
- Yes!

07:09.563 --> 07:11.198
- Finally.

07:11.298 --> 07:15.503
- [spy music]

07:24.945 --> 07:27.080
- [keypad beeping]

07:28.949 --> 07:30.684
- Max?
- [screams]

07:36.389 --> 07:37.958
- What are you doing in here?
- Shhh!

07:38.058 --> 07:40.661
- Why are you shushing me--
the van is soundproof.

07:40.761 --> 07:44.064
- Oh, well, in that
case, get out!

07:44.164 --> 07:45.566
Taking it on a joyride.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.868
-You get out--
I'm trying to study.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.136
How did you even get in here?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.104
- I spent the last hour
hacking into Dad's computer

07:51.204 --> 07:53.340
to get his password.
- BOTH: Hamburger.

07:55.442 --> 07:59.346
- How'd you know?
- I've met him.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.948
- Well, since we're both here,

08:01.048 --> 08:02.616
let's take this baby
to Medieval Munchies--

08:02.716 --> 08:04.952
Friday's 2-for-1
turkey leg night.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.820
- No, I'm trying
to study this manual.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.322
- Fine, okay, I'll quiz ya.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.561
All right, so where is...

08:13.661 --> 08:15.729
hyperspeed button?
- PHOEBE: Uh, there.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.798
- MAX: Rocket mode button?
- PHOEBE: There.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.433
- Button that turns on the van?

08:20.568 --> 08:22.235
- Nice try.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.237
- Oh, so you don't
know where it is.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.806
- I'm not falling for that.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.309
- Phoebe, it's okay to not
know everything about the van.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.444
- It's right there!
- [car starts]

08:31.579 --> 08:33.781
- Max!

08:33.881 --> 08:37.317
- Autopilot, take
us to Medieval Munchies.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.361
- Well, Teddy, we're
halfway up the mountain.

08:48.461 --> 08:52.299
Which way next,
my faithful sidekick?

08:52.399 --> 08:55.468
What do you mean
you lost the map?

08:55.603 --> 08:58.606
You fool, you stranded us.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.341
Arghhhhh!!!

09:04.244 --> 09:07.815
- MAN: [in English accent]
Two Henry VIIIs

09:07.915 --> 09:10.483
and two Black Death Coolers.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.152
Thank ye--cometh again.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.420
- Thank you.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.990
- Autopilot, driveth.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.993
Let us hoist
our medieval munchies.

09:20.093 --> 09:23.631
- [cell phone chirping]

09:23.731 --> 09:26.066
- Could I not hear a dying bird

09:26.166 --> 09:28.168
while I eat my turkey leg?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.370
- It's just my friends
chirping about the movie.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.805
- Space Teens?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.642
Phoebe, you're in a
super-powered van on a joyride.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.443
This is a lot more fun.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.046
- But it's not a joyride--
it's a pre-training session.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.148
- Whatever you call
it, it's a blast.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.955
- What happened
to my turkey leg?

09:48.055 --> 09:49.790
- [loud belch]

09:49.890 --> 09:52.726
- Something tells me
that burp comes with a bow.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.328
Autopilot, pull over.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.874
- [loud belch]

10:06.974 --> 10:09.476
Excuse me.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.511
- What are you
two doing in here?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.213
- Playing where
we're not supposed to.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.349
It's how we do!

10:16.449 --> 10:19.653
- Who told you Dad's
password was hamburger?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.455
- The grease stains
on his T-shirt.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.591
- Okay, well, we gotta
get you guys back home.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.260
- No! We don't
want to go home yet!

10:27.360 --> 10:28.696
- Yeah, I haven't
finished my joyride.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.063
- We're gonna get busted.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.665
- No, we're not!
- We're not gonna get busted.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.933
- [shouting over each other]

10:33.033 --> 10:34.868
- Guys! Guys!

10:34.968 --> 10:36.837
- [alarm sounding]

10:36.937 --> 10:38.071
- What did you do?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.539
Everyone was all stressed out,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.809
so I pushed
the de-stress button.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.779
- De-stress?
- BILLY: Uh-huh.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.250
- That says "Distress"...

10:50.350 --> 10:53.320
as in send out an alert
saying, "Hey, world,

10:53.420 --> 10:57.390
"We're a bunch of kids in a van
who shouldn't be in a van!"

10:57.490 --> 10:59.226
- So I should stop pushing it?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.868
- Hank...

11:08.969 --> 11:11.538
- I thought I heard a burglar.

11:11.638 --> 11:15.108
- In the refrigerator?

11:15.208 --> 11:18.045
Look it's the Thundervan's
distress signal.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.652
- HANK: It's gone!

11:25.753 --> 11:28.155
I bet one of my enemies followed
me home from Metroburg

11:28.255 --> 11:29.757
and stole it.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.826
But how did he figure
out my foolproof password?

11:32.926 --> 11:35.662
- You mean "hamburger"?
- [sputtering]

11:35.763 --> 11:39.399
Well, that evil genius is
in for the ride of his life,

11:39.499 --> 11:42.235
thanks to my advanced
security system.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.074
- MALE VOICE: Intruder
Lockdown Mode activated.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.009
- I swear I didn't
push anything.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.347
- ALL: [screaming]

11:55.883 --> 11:57.084
- MALE VOICE: Five, four...

11:57.184 --> 11:59.887
- Everybody buckle up!
- MALE VOICE: Three, two, one...

12:01.789 --> 12:03.991
- [rushing sound]

12:04.091 --> 12:06.293
- It's hyperspeed!

12:06.393 --> 12:09.362
- [slowly] G-force selfies!

12:13.700 --> 12:15.335
Ugh!

12:21.541 --> 12:25.178
We're at the bottom
of the ocean.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.679
- Is everyone okay?
- No,

12:26.814 --> 12:29.216
[screaming] 'cause we're
at the bottom of the ocean!

12:38.491 --> 12:39.592
- We've pushed every button.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.861
Nothing's getting
us out of here!

12:40.961 --> 12:43.831
- MALE VOICE: Two minutes
of oxygen remaining.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.465
- We're running out of air!

12:45.565 --> 12:47.000
- Just calm down, everybody.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.468
Take deep breaths.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.138
- [inhales deeply]

12:56.743 --> 13:00.280
- There's gotta be some way to
turn off Intruder Lockdown Mode.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.714
Uh, let's see... aha!

13:01.849 --> 13:04.551
Chapter 75.
- Yeah, yeah, right there.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.520
- "Chapter removed
in case you are an intruder."

13:08.455 --> 13:12.659
Uh, "Please see Chapter 76,
'Sucks to be you.'"

13:14.962 --> 13:18.398
We really are stuck down here.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.968
- Or not!

13:21.068 --> 13:23.770
- [chuckling]
- You're having a good old time

13:23.871 --> 13:25.438
pushing buttons,
aren't you, Hank?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.876
-Whoever's in the van
deserves this.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.311
- All you've done is bring
it back into the driveway.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.713
- Yes, but thanks
to this simulator,

13:33.881 --> 13:36.716
the thief thinks he was
at the bottom of the ocean,

13:36.884 --> 13:40.153
and now... [chuckles]

13:40.253 --> 13:43.290
he thinks he's riding
at hyperspeed.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.393
- ALL: [screaming]

13:49.930 --> 13:51.631
- [chuckling]
- Hank, shh!

13:51.731 --> 13:53.800
You'll wake the kids.
- Oh, you're right.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.903
We don't want to wake
our little angels...

13:55.969 --> 13:58.038
or Max.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.740
- [keypad beeping]
- [chuckling]

14:00.908 --> 14:03.510
All right, and now,
thanks to my new cameras,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.745
we are gonna see who's inside.

14:05.913 --> 14:09.249
- [alarm beeping]
- "Audio and video unavailable"!

14:09.349 --> 14:11.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not good.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.453
All right, better
call Tech Support.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.488
- Can I pretend
to send him somewhere?

14:15.588 --> 14:16.957
- Yep, just be quick.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.525
Hello, this is Thunderman.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.060
I'm having a problem--

14:20.160 --> 14:22.963
oh--uh--yeah, uh, sure.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.297
I'll do it.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.667
Thunderman, away!

14:27.767 --> 14:30.270
I would love to do it
for your boss.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.174
I can't say no to a fan--
I'm all he has.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.609
- Ooh, this one looks scary.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.451
- Well... at least
we're probably not

14:44.551 --> 14:46.353
at the bottom
of the ocean anymore.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.592
- Right, Max... we're
inside a boiling volcano.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.328
Much better.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.131
- Yeah, Max, thanks
for the joyride.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.732
- Oh, and the turkey leg.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.569
It really hit the spot.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.972
- We were just fine
hiding in the back

15:05.005 --> 15:07.307
while Phoebe was studying.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.776
- Hey, you guys remember

15:09.876 --> 15:12.345
when Billy hit
the Distress button?

15:12.445 --> 15:15.448
- Don't you dare bring
this back to me!

15:17.750 --> 15:20.287
- COLOSSO: "This will be
my final journal entry.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.122
"Morale is low.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.057
"Rations are lower.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.994
"I've come to accept
the inevitable.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.762
Tonight I eat Teddy."

15:32.565 --> 15:34.001
Oh, what's that, Teddy?

15:34.067 --> 15:37.004
Oh, I'm just jotting down
a recipe for breakfast.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.838
Well, get some sleep.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.608
I'll take the first watch.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.910
[sinister laugh]

15:46.246 --> 15:48.448
- Okay, guys, there's
good news and bad news.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.083
The bad news is it's
only a matter of time

15:50.183 --> 15:51.718
before the lava melts
through the van.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.820
- What's the good news?
- I don't have any.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.856
Didn't think I'd live long
enough to finish the sentence.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.758
- What are we supposed to do?

15:58.858 --> 16:01.794
As long as the van is
in lockdown, we're...

16:01.894 --> 16:03.396
trapped.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.467
- This can't be it.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.203
I haven't conquered
the world yet.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.439
And I was so close!

16:12.539 --> 16:14.774
Seriously, you guys
have no idea.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.576
- What about me?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.246
I haven't finished
reading Phoebe's diary.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.780
- Nora!

16:20.880 --> 16:23.416
- And I haven't finished
learning how to read.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.885
De-stress? Who am I kidding?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.689
- What are we worried about?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.124
Phoebe's gonna save us!

16:31.224 --> 16:34.161
- Yeah, she's going to be
the best superhero ever.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.263
- I'm not so sure
about that, guys.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.198
- Phoebe, they're right, okay?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.866
You might as well
be a full supe already.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.069
You train like crazy.
- Yeah,

16:42.135 --> 16:44.837
and you were in here studying
when this whole thing started.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.773
- Yeah, Phoebe--
- ALL: [talking over each other]

16:46.873 --> 16:49.476
- You are gonna save us!
- You guys, stop!

16:49.576 --> 16:53.180
I wasn't studying.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.284
I was in the Thundervan
'cause I was gonna take it

16:57.384 --> 16:59.252
to sneak out
and meet my friends.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.189
- ALL: [gasp]

17:02.289 --> 17:05.258
Shocked selfie!

17:07.627 --> 17:10.097
- Ohh, no, thank you, Kevin.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.100
Thunderman, good-bye!

17:13.166 --> 17:15.102
All right, they rebooted
the surveillance system.

17:15.135 --> 17:21.174
Now let's see the criminal
mastermind who stole our van!

17:21.274 --> 17:24.577
- BARB: Those are our
criminal masterminds!

17:24.677 --> 17:26.946
- [on TV] I was gonna
take the Thundervan

17:27.114 --> 17:29.249
and go to the movies
without Mom and Dad knowing.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.817
- She what?

17:30.917 --> 17:33.120
- I know I was supposed
to study tonight, but...

17:33.153 --> 17:34.887
when I got that message
from my friends,

17:34.987 --> 17:36.789
all I really wanted
was to skip training

17:36.889 --> 17:38.291
and go have fun with them.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.229
- Phoebe, that is
so irresponsible.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.597
I'm so proud of you.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.536
- Yeah, well, Mom
and Dad won't be.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.538
I can't help it.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.740
I really like being
a normal girl.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.543
- Is she saying she wants to
blow off being a superhero?

17:56.643 --> 17:59.146
- [on TV] I'm not saying I want
to blow off being a superhero.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.651
I just don't want to go
to Hero University right now.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.154
I want to go to prom
and school plays

18:07.187 --> 18:09.422
and football games.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.992
Isn't that why we moved to
Hiddenville in the first place?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.462
- Yes, it is, baby, yes it is!

18:15.562 --> 18:18.064
Hank, get them out of there!

18:18.165 --> 18:21.434
- [keypad beeps]

18:21.534 --> 18:23.203
- [alarms sounding]

18:23.303 --> 18:25.172
- Not again!

18:25.205 --> 18:27.174
Please, Thundervan gods,

18:27.274 --> 18:30.577
take us to a puppy farm!

18:30.677 --> 18:33.380
- MALE VOICE: Intruder Lockdown
Mode deactivated.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.217
- [yelling] It's horrible!

18:37.317 --> 18:40.787
It's worse than I could
have possibly imagined!

18:40.887 --> 18:42.955
[normal voice] Oh, I live here.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.526
- We're home.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.461
Oh, my gosh, you
guys, we're home.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.497
Wait, how are we home?

18:50.597 --> 18:53.433
- We're sorry, kids--the whole
thing was a simulation.

18:53.533 --> 18:57.036
We thought the van had been
stolen by some evil mastermind.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.939
- Well, technically
you weren't too far off.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.342
- Let's get out of here!

19:02.442 --> 19:03.576
- [electric buzzing]

19:03.676 --> 19:05.212
- PHOEBE: Billy!

19:05.278 --> 19:07.614
- MALE VOICE: Rocket
Mode activated.

19:07.714 --> 19:11.050
- Uh-oh.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.254
- [air hissing]

19:14.354 --> 19:15.822
- It's in Rocket Mode.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.425
They're about to blast
off... for real.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.460
- Blast off to where?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.094
- I don't know!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.999
- [on TV] Kids, do whatever you
can to get out of there.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.701
This is not a simulation.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.304
We're trying to--

19:31.404 --> 19:34.541
- I got it--the manual!

19:34.641 --> 19:39.111
[yelling] I don't want
to get blasted into space!

19:39.246 --> 19:41.147
[panting]

19:41.248 --> 19:45.151
This isn't working!

19:45.252 --> 19:47.153
- Space--space... that's it!

19:47.254 --> 19:49.889
Max, when everyone was
trapped in an enemy ship

19:49.989 --> 19:51.391
in "Last Teen Mission
to Space Part I,"

19:51.491 --> 19:53.326
they escaped by ripping
a hole in the floor.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.362
- Spoiler alert!

19:55.462 --> 19:58.265
- No, Billy, we might be able
to melt a hole in the floor

19:58.331 --> 20:00.500
and get out of here.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.869
- Barb, use your electricity!

20:02.969 --> 20:04.437
- Hank, I can't--
the van's metal.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.506
- Just do it!

20:06.606 --> 20:10.843
[voice wobbling] Ahh,
stop doing it!

20:14.314 --> 20:15.382
- How would we do that?

20:15.482 --> 20:17.350
The melting point of the van's
2,000 degrees.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.119
- Okay, well, maybe if Billy
super-shuffles his feet

20:20.219 --> 20:21.888
and Nora concentrates her lasers

20:21.988 --> 20:23.323
while you and I
combine our heat breath,

20:23.423 --> 20:24.957
it might be hot enough
to melt the van.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.426
What do you think?
- [laser blasting]

20:26.526 --> 20:28.227
- Just waiting for you, blabby.

20:28.328 --> 20:32.899
- MALE VOICE: Blastoff in five,
four, three, two, one...

20:32.999 --> 20:39.839
- [action music]

20:39.939 --> 20:42.509
- My babies, they're...
- Right there?

20:45.111 --> 20:46.946
Thank goodness!
- BARB: I love you guys!

20:47.046 --> 20:49.449
- NORA: Phoebe saved us!
- It was so intense!

20:49.549 --> 20:52.151
- Listen, Phoebe, I heard
everything you said in there

20:52.251 --> 20:54.186
about Hero University.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.855
- Are you disappointed
that I don't want to take

20:55.955 --> 20:58.090
the early admissions test?
- A little,

20:58.190 --> 21:01.160
but I'll always be more
disappointed in Max.

21:01.328 --> 21:05.064
- BOTH: Aww, thanks, Dad!

21:05.164 --> 21:06.933
- Hey, looks like the Thundervan

21:07.033 --> 21:09.168
is just gonna crash
into the ocean.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.472
- Oh no, I left my bow in there!

21:12.572 --> 21:15.241
- [sighs] Thunderman, away!

21:17.176 --> 21:20.212
- Oh, wait, heh...
here it is.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.219
- Honey, I know you want
to take a break from training,

21:27.354 --> 21:29.589
but there's one last
feature of the Thundervan

21:29.689 --> 21:30.957
I want to show you.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.792
Juuust push that button.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.797
[chuckles]

21:37.897 --> 21:40.667
Perfect hamburgers!

21:40.767 --> 21:42.935
- Everybody grab a password!

21:45.204 --> 21:47.574
- Good call on
the drive-in, Dad.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.509
- Bad call on the movie, Phoebe.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.077
- What?

21:51.177 --> 21:53.446
"Last Teen Mission
to Space Part II"

21:53.546 --> 21:55.247
is totes cool.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.883
- Not bad, Mom.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.985
- Yeah, well, I am groovetastic.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.720
Ooh, Barb in the house--

22:00.820 --> 22:02.121
Oh!

22:05.392 --> 22:07.560
- And we're back to don't.

22:11.698 --> 22:15.902
- *
