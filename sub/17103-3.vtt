WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:07.475
( theme music playing )

01:40.968 --> 01:44.104
( metal jangling;
creaking )

02:20.608 --> 02:24.212
( Sofie whispering )
BEN? BEN, WAKE UP.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.348
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I SMELL SMOKE.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.199
NO FIRE.
NO SMOKE.
NOTHING.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.636
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I'M SURE.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.804
THERE'S NOTHING.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.241
MAYBE IT WAS A DREAM.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.476
YEAH, MAYBE.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.712
PROBABLY.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.197
( barks )

03:35.949 --> 03:38.752
GABE?

04:13.854 --> 04:17.157
Tommy:
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE AWAY.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.792
WE ALREADY WENT
OVER THIS, MR. DOLAN.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.894
I WENT OVER IT WITH YOU,
NOW WITH YOUR BROTHER.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.497
- JUSTIN?
- NOT A SINGLE SOUL
WILL BE TURNED AWAY.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.799
FOR PETE'S SAKE, JUSTIN,
YOU KNOW THE ONLY REASON

04:25.899 --> 04:27.768
A LOT OF THEM ARE HERE
IS FOR A HOT MEAL.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.603
THEN THEY WILL BE FED.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.672
( laughing )

04:33.273 --> 04:35.309
IT'S NOT JUST THE FOOD.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.378
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE
MIGHT BE CRIMINALS.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.112
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
POURING IN.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.815
- MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR AN ANGLE--
- ( splashes )

04:41.915 --> 04:44.318
DAMN IT!

04:44.418 --> 04:47.220
THEY'RE NOT ALL HERE
TO BE SAVED, BROTHER JUSTIN.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.923
THEY'VE COME BECAUSE
THEY WERE CALLED,
MR. DOLAN.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.660
I NEED THEM ALL.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.933
Sofie:
EVERYTHING SEEMS WORSE
WHEN I'M TRYING TO SLEEP.

05:01.369 --> 05:04.805
I SMELLED SMOKE.
IT WASN'T A DREAM.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.576
IT WASN'T.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.479
SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF ALL THIS AIN'T THE DREAM.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.782
IF IT IS,
I WANT TO WAKE UP.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.454
YOU SHOULD DO THAT MORE.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.826
I WAS WONDERING...

05:25.926 --> 05:29.497
IF YOU WANNA DO ONE
OF THOSE READINGS
WITH THE CARDS.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.900
IT DOESN'T WORK
WITHOUT MAMA.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.370
WE COULD GIVE IT A SHOT.

05:36.470 --> 05:39.373
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.612
DO ME A FAVOR,

05:44.712 --> 05:47.448
GET THE CARDS.
BURN THEM.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.183
TAKE THEM OUT OF MY PLACE
AND BURN THEM.

05:50.283 --> 05:53.754
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE 'EM AGAIN.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.729
I TAKE IT YOU'LL
BE NEEDING A TRUCK.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.964
YEAH.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.800
BEEN IN INGRAM A WEEK.

06:06.900 --> 06:12.506
A SHIT BURG LIKE THIS...
IT AIN'T WORTH A DAY.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.209
WHAT'RE YOU SAYIN'?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.746
IF WE STICK AROUND
MUCH LONGER,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.748
THEY'RE GONNA
START GROUSING.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.750
YOU TELL HIM I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.819
- HE KNOWS THAT.
- THEN WHY YOU CRAWLING UP
MY HOOP ABOUT IT?

06:25.919 --> 06:28.556
I'VE BEEN
ALL OVER THIS PLACE.
I AIN'T FOUND NOTHING.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.592
IT'S NOT LIKE KERRIGAN
GAVE ME A ROAD MAP.

06:31.692 --> 06:35.696
ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST ASKING.

06:38.866 --> 06:42.002
THERE'S SOME RANCH ROADS
IN THE HILLS.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.106
I'M GONNA RUN THEM OUT,
SEE WHAT'S WHAT.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.645
I'LL TELL HIM.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.585
KID...

06:58.919 --> 07:01.188
WATCH YOUR BACK.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.891
IS THAT COMING
FROM YOU OR HIM?

07:03.991 --> 07:06.694
IT'S BOTH OF US.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.569
- ( ragtime music blaring )
- ( wind roaring )

07:16.970 --> 07:20.641
TURN OFF THAT DAMNED
SQUAWK-O-DYNE.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.617
Announcer:
Drink Moxie,
the only soft drink

07:29.717 --> 07:31.585
with the genuine
Moxie taste.

07:31.685 --> 07:35.723
MOXIE, THE ONLY SOFT DRINK
YOU'LL EVER CRAVE.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.626
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,

07:38.726 --> 07:40.994
LEND A KIND EAR,
AS WE BRING YOU

07:41.094 --> 07:46.967
Brother Justin's
Saturday morning
"Church of the Air"!

07:53.641 --> 07:56.109
GOOD MORNING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

07:56.209 --> 08:00.648
I WAS JUST MAKING SOME NOTES
A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

08:00.748 --> 08:04.918
AND YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT.

08:05.018 --> 08:10.057
I WAS THINKING ABOUT...
SALT.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.894
IN MANY WAYS,
SALT MIGHT APPEAR TO BE
A CURSE FROM ABOVE.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.731
THE SALT FROM THE SWEAT
OF OUR BACK-BREAKING LABORS.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.401
THE SALT FROM THE TEARS
OF A CHILD GONE HUNGRY.

08:21.501 --> 08:27.140
THE SALT RUBBED UNMERCIFULLY
INTO THE LASH MARKS
LEFT BY THE WHIP.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.877
THE OCEANS THEMSELVES,
GREAT BODIES OF WATER

08:29.977 --> 08:33.346
THAT MIGHT IRRIGATE
THIS WITHERED LAND,
BUT CANNOT. AND WHY?

08:33.446 --> 08:38.151
BECAUSE THEY ARE
POISONED WITH SALT.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.590
AND YET... WE KNOW

08:42.690 --> 08:44.958
THAT IT IS NOT A CURSE;

08:46.259 --> 08:47.828
IT IS A BLESSING.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.699
A MERE PINCH KILLS
THE WRITHING SLUG

08:51.799 --> 08:53.567
THAT RAVISHES OUR GARDEN,

08:53.667 --> 08:57.270
the leech that sucks
our lifeblood.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.309
And let us not forget,
brothers and sisters,

09:02.409 --> 09:04.544
the salt upon our tables,

09:04.645 --> 09:07.781
PURE AND WHITE,

09:07.881 --> 09:11.451
THAT INCREASES
OUR ENJOYMENT

09:11.551 --> 09:14.622
OF GOD'S SIMPLE BOUNTY.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.663
Ruthie:
YOU MIND?

09:22.763 --> 09:26.466
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- THEY'VE BEEN SKITTISH.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.369
ONE OF THEM MUST'VE BIT
THE OTHERS...

09:29.469 --> 09:31.939
OR THEY GOT SICK.

09:34.107 --> 09:37.210
WHO KNOWS WHY
SOME THINGS DIE?

09:40.447 --> 09:43.483
WHY YOU BEEN
DUCKING ME, BEN?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.620
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.357
YEAH?
THEN WHY WON'T YOU
EVEN LOOK AT ME?

09:51.859 --> 09:54.194
IF I DID SOMETHING TO YOU,
OR SAID SOMETHING,

09:54.294 --> 09:57.164
YOU STAND UP LIKE A MAN,
BEN HAWKINS, AND YOU TELL ME.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.267
DON'T YOU HIDE
FROM ME LIKE YOU HIDE
FROM EVERYTHING ELSE.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.235
I AIN'T HIDING FROM YOU.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.539
WELL, YOU'RE DOING
A PRETTY GOOD IMPERSONATION.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.442
OKAY, I DON'T WANT
TO BE AROUND YOU.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.879
SATISFIED?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.315
YOU'RE SCARED OF SOMETHING.

10:15.415 --> 10:19.787
THE ONLY THING SCARES ME
IS FOLKS USING OTHER FOLKS
TO USE ME.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.922
YOU THINK
I WANT TO USE YOU?
FOR WHAT?

10:22.022 --> 10:25.125
FORGET IT, GOD DAMN IT.
IT AIN'T EVEN ABOUT YOU!

10:27.494 --> 10:29.897
JUST FORGET EVERYTHING.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.801
YOU SAID IT--
SOME THINGS DIE;

10:35.769 --> 10:38.238
SOME THINGS DON'T.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.781
( ragtime music playing )

11:20.881 --> 11:23.851
Rita Sue:
I CAN'T KEEP UP
THIS PACE, FELIX.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.652
Stumpy:
OH HELL,
THIS AIN'T NOTHING.

11:25.753 --> 11:29.489
YOU GOT US PUTTING OUT
FROM NOON TILL SUNDAY.

11:29.589 --> 11:33.560
WELL, THIS ONE HERE'S
A SPECIAL FELLOW.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.864
TRUTH BE TOLD, HE'S AN ALDERMAN,
COULD BE MAYOR OF INGRAM
SOME DAY.

11:36.964 --> 11:39.366
I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE...

11:39.466 --> 11:42.770
MAKE PRETTY GOOD SENSE
FOR THE FUTURE, IS WHA
I THOUGHT.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.973
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT,
AS USUAL.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.808
OKAY, THEN.
I'LL SEND HIM ON HIS WAY.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.143
NO MATTER.
YOU SAY THE WORD.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.751
I'M ALL...

11:57.851 --> 12:00.187
MESSED UP
DOWN THERE.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.843
( belches )

12:32.352 --> 12:34.254
( groans )

12:39.159 --> 12:42.863
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
GET!

12:44.631 --> 12:47.968
( fizzing )

13:04.918 --> 13:06.954
HEY, SOFIE!

13:12.092 --> 13:13.560
DID YOU DO
LIKE I ASKED?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.463
YEAH, I BURNED THEM.
EXCEPT THIS ONE.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.499
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

13:19.599 --> 13:21.134
NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.170
IT WAS IN THERE
WITH THE OTHERS.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.572
WELL, I'VE SEEN EVERY ONE
A THOUSAND TIMES.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.541
IT'S NOT ONE OF MINE.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.311
IT WAS IN THERE
WITH THE OTHERS!

13:31.411 --> 13:33.580
THEN BURN IT!

14:28.835 --> 14:31.404
WELCOME HOME, NORMAN.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.111
HEY, JONES.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.447
LIBBY.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.786
- HERE, I GOT IT.
- NO, DON'T.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.122
NO, NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.526
PUT HER THERE.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.067
THERE YOU GO.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.671
Samson:
HEY, JONESY.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.940
HOW YOU DOING THERE,
BUTTERCUP?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.409
- HOW COME YOU AIN'T INSIDE?
- COMMERCE.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.946
SINCE WHEN'D YOUR MAMA
PLY HER TRADE BEFORE
THE CRACK OF NOON?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.382
ASK HER SQUEALING JOHNNIE.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.960
I COULD USE AN EXTRA PAIR
OF HANDS ON COLOSSUS.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.329
HELL, YOU GOT FOUR GUYS
ON THERE NOW.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.598
THREE GUYS.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.635
Samson:
SHE SEEMS TO BE
HOLDING HER OWN.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.438
Jones:
IT AIN'T HER.
IT'S THE REST OF THEM.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.273
THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.010
- SINCE WHEN DOES THAT CUT ICE?
- PLUS SHE DON'T KNOW JACK.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.346
SO? OSGOOD DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIND HIS PECKER

15:46.446 --> 15:49.449
IF THE LIGHT ISN'T ON.
HE MANAGES.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.021
LOOK, IF YOU'RE ANGLING
TO GET HER ASS CAND,

15:54.121 --> 15:56.723
YOU'RE HUNTING
WITH THE WRONG DOG.
I LIKE HER.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.858
HELL, SAMSON!
IT'S YOUR SHOW--

15:58.958 --> 16:02.462
AND IT'S YOUR CREW!
YOU WANNA CAN HER,
DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.331
YOU HANDLE IT!

16:11.571 --> 16:13.740
( clangs )

16:13.840 --> 16:15.875
WATCH IT UP THERE!

16:15.975 --> 16:18.345
SORRY.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.190
LITTLE LATE IN THE DAY
FOR BREAKFAST.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.761
HONEY PIE,
I COULD EAT BREAKFAST
THREE TIMES A DAY.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.267
GIVE A HOLLER
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.273
ONE THING--

16:46.373 --> 16:48.508
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE
AT THE MISSION,

16:48.608 --> 16:51.078
YOU SAW THE CAR.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.847
DAMNED VULTURE.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.684
YOU WANT A STORY,
TALK TO THE COPS.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.288
IT'S OVER.
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE IT A REST?

17:01.388 --> 17:05.892
YOU KNOW, A YOUNG LADY
CAME TO ME THE OTHER DAY,

17:05.992 --> 17:07.727
NO OLDER THAN YOU,
I'M SURE.

17:07.827 --> 17:11.264
SHE WAS A GOOD CHRISTIAN
WHO HAD BEEN IN A BAD WAY.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.801
AN UNWED MOTHER,
HAD TO GIVE HER BABY UP
A FEW YEARS BACK.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.037
SHE'D GOTTEN HER LIFE
BACK ON TRACK

17:18.138 --> 17:19.872
AND TOLD ME
I COULD INTERVIEW HER

17:19.972 --> 17:21.641
IF I COULD JUST FIND OUT
IF HER BABY

17:21.741 --> 17:24.577
WAS AMONG THOSE WHO PERISHED
IN THE MINTERN FIRE.

17:24.677 --> 17:28.081
I HAD TO TELL HER
HE WAS.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.684
ME, NOT THE COPS.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.256
NOW, WHAT I COULDN'T
TELL HER

17:36.356 --> 17:39.192
WAS THAT THE FLESH
OF THOSE CHILDREN

17:39.292 --> 17:41.094
ROASTED SO BLACK,

17:41.194 --> 17:43.763
IT FELL STRAIGHT AWAY
FROM THEIR LITTLE BONES

17:43.863 --> 17:46.266
WHEN THEY TRIED
TO MOVE THEM.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.408
( change jingles )

17:56.075 --> 17:57.377
"LET IT REST"?

17:57.477 --> 17:59.646
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
SHE RESTS?

17:59.746 --> 18:03.383
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
THOSE KIDS ARE RESTING?

18:12.225 --> 18:14.261
HE WAS SLUMPED DOWN.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.263
SLUMPED DOWN,
OR NOT VERY TALL?

18:16.363 --> 18:18.465
I COULDN'T SEE HIM.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.100
YOU'RE SURE
IT WAS A HIM?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.836
COULD IT HAVE BEEN
A WOMAN?

18:26.939 --> 18:30.277
YEAH. YEAH,
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.218
JUST ONE MORE THING--

18:42.121 --> 18:44.491
TOAST.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.527
I ASKED
FOR WHEAT TOAST.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.129
DRY.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.501
YEAH.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.629
HOWDY, FRIEND.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.665
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY
AROUND THESE PARTS
CALLED THE CRONE?

19:25.765 --> 19:28.468
TAKE THIS ROAD
FOR A COUPLE OF MILES,

19:28.568 --> 19:31.771
AND RIGHT UP YONDER,
THE ROAD SPLITS.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.373
YOU BEAR RIGHT,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.908
THEN YOU WILL BE ON
OLD CHERRY BLOSSOM ROAD.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.744
YOU GO TILL YOU SEE
A HOUSE.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.713
HOW DO I KNOW
THE HOUSE?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.549
AIN'T BUT ONE.

19:42.649 --> 19:46.085
HEY, HEY,
HOLD UP A MITE,
FRIEND.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.822
HERE. COME ON OUT.
I NEED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

19:49.922 --> 19:54.193
- WHAT?
- WELL, COME ON OUT.
I WON'T HURT YOU.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.219
GO ON.
SHOW HIM.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.328
WHAT THE HELL
YOU DO THAT FOR?

20:28.428 --> 20:32.131
SHE'S ABNORMAL.
A RETARD.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.734
BUT SHE DON'T COMPLAIN.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.571
WON'T TELL NOBODY.
BACK OF YOUR TRUCK
FOR $2.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.974
SHE'S TIGHT.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.492
( whimpering )

21:05.332 --> 21:07.700
I'M SORRY.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.523
DON'T DO THAT NO MORE.

21:31.324 --> 21:34.694
NO, I WON'T.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.063
EVER AGAIN.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.902
( sniveling )

21:53.913 --> 21:59.619
Stroud:
* JUST ME AND MY SHADOW

21:59.719 --> 22:04.090
* ALL ALONE
AND FEELIN' BLUE... *

22:23.743 --> 22:25.578
( humming )

22:41.761 --> 22:46.098
HENRY SCUDDER.
LOOK AT YOU.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.539
* AND WHEN IT'S 12:00

22:52.639 --> 22:55.174
* WE CLIMB THE STAIRS

22:55.274 --> 22:56.743
* WE NEVER KNOCK

22:56.843 --> 23:00.046
( echoing )
* 'CAUSE NOBODY'S THERE.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.349
Justin:
* AND WHEN IT'S 12:00

23:03.450 --> 23:07.019
* AND WE CLIMB
THE STAIRS *

23:07.119 --> 23:10.222
* WE NEVER KNOCK

23:10.322 --> 23:14.527
* FOR THERE'S NOBODY--
WHOOP!

23:16.729 --> 23:19.499
THERE.

23:33.446 --> 23:37.717
YOU KNOW,
I CAN REMEMBER...

23:37.817 --> 23:40.587
SITTING
AT YOUR KNEE
AT THE PERGOLA

23:40.687 --> 23:43.322
IN THE COOL
SPRING EVENINGS

23:43.422 --> 23:45.357
WHILE YOU READ
YOUR BIBLE.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.660
OPEN.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.197
GOOD.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.766
I REMEMBER TRYING
TO LIFT IT.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.472
IT SEEMED TOO HEAVY
FOR ONE PERSON TO HOLD.

23:59.572 --> 24:03.075
YOU KNOW THE FIRST WORD
I COULD READ IN ENGLISH--

24:03.175 --> 24:05.211
OPEN.

24:05.311 --> 24:08.080
--WAS FROM YOUR BIBLE.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.456
IT WAS "GARDEN."
REMEMBER?

24:17.557 --> 24:21.594
OH, IT'S GOING
TO GLISTEN, NORMAN.

24:21.694 --> 24:25.832
THE RADIO TOWER ALONE
WILL BE OVER 200 FEET TALL.

24:42.414 --> 24:45.852
DID I TELL YOU
WHAT TOMMY DOLAN SAID?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.456
HE SAID,

24:50.557 --> 24:54.694
IN A SINGLE
COAST-TO-COAST
BROADCAST...

24:54.794 --> 24:56.796
I WILL SPEAK
TO MORE SOULS

24:56.896 --> 25:01.133
THAN OUR LORD DID
IN HIS ENTIRE LIFETIME.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.175
IT'S GOING
TO BE BREATHTAKING.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.684
THAT'S RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
STEP RIGHT UP IN CLOSE

25:51.784 --> 25:56.388
TO WITNESS THE PLUSH, RICH
TEXTURE OF WOMANHOOD
SELDOM SEEN.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.726
PLENTY OF ROOM, BOYS.
STEP ON IN.

25:59.826 --> 26:02.762
YOU AIN'T GONNA
LIKE THIS, MAMA.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.900
C'MON BOYS.
COME ON IN TIGHT

26:08.000 --> 26:10.770
AND GET A GANDER
OF SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT
LIKELY TO SEE

26:10.870 --> 26:15.207
UNTIL YOUR WEDDING NIGHT,
AND MAYBE NOT EVEN THEN.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.610
( chuckles )

26:20.579 --> 26:23.883
COME ON OUT HERE,
LITTLE FLOWERS,

26:23.983 --> 26:28.621
AND DEMONSTRATE THE MEANING
OF THE WORD DESIRE!

26:28.721 --> 26:30.857
( cheering )

26:34.661 --> 26:37.596
( burlesque music playing )

26:37.697 --> 26:39.565
THIS IS NOT
YOUR MOTHER.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.500
THIS IS
NOT YOUR SISTER.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.303
THIS IS NOT
YOUR AUNT CLAUDINE.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.572
FRET NOT,
GENTLEMEN,

26:46.673 --> 26:48.841
WHERE YOUR IMAGINATION
WILL TAKE YOU.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.243
IT TAKES YOU
TO A LAND

26:51.343 --> 26:54.881
WHERE ONLY PLEASURE
RESIDES.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.885
( boys hooting )

27:06.926 --> 27:09.061
YOU BEEN SWIGGING
WOOD ALCOHOL AGAIN?

27:09.161 --> 27:12.598
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE PEDDLING FLESH TO A
GODDAMN SUNDAY SCHOOL OUTING.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.400
DON'T YOU EVER DEMEAN
WHAT I DO.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.736
I DO NOT PEDDLE FLESH.
I SELL DREAMS.

27:16.836 --> 27:19.171
THIS IS WHAT COMES FROM DOING
A SHOW BEFORE DUSK.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.307
IF THEY DON'T RUN US OUT
THEY'RE GONNA LOCK US UP.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.810
Stumpy:
NO, NO, DARLING.
NO, NO, NO.

27:23.910 --> 27:27.479
THE LITTLE
FRECKLY-FACED KID OUT THERE,
HE'S THE SHERIFF'S SON.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.883
SEE, HIS OLD MAN
SLIPPED ME A FIN,
TOLD ME TO WALK THEM IN.

27:30.983 --> 27:34.586
AND YOU KNOW ME.
I NEVER ARGUE WITH LAW
OR LOCAL CUSTOM.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.123
WE DOING KIDDIE SHOWS NOW?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.527
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.429
OH.

27:45.331 --> 27:49.101
YOU BETTER GO OUT THERE.
GET ON. YOUR DAUGHTER'S
DANCING LONELY.

27:49.201 --> 27:52.772
( sighs )

27:59.178 --> 28:01.313
( cheering )

28:12.191 --> 28:13.592
HEY THERE, BUD!

28:13.692 --> 28:17.129
HEY. WHY DON'T YOU
GET ON IN THERE

28:17.229 --> 28:18.630
FREE OF CHARGE?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.599
OH GOD,
IT'S GONNA BE A HELL
OF A BLOW-OFF.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.769
I AIN'T HERE
FOR NO TITTY SHOW.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.872
OH HELL NO.
I KNOW THAT.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.947
WELL.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.649
I HAD BETTER--
I'D BETTER GET BACK
ON IN THERE

28:37.750 --> 28:40.419
OR THE WARDEN WILL
SKIN ME ALIVE.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.922
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

28:50.529 --> 28:53.465
LATER.
AFTER THE SHOW.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.514
( squeaking )

29:56.128 --> 29:58.164
HEY!

30:36.635 --> 30:38.971
( buzzing )

30:48.680 --> 30:51.483

31:00.259 --> 31:02.761
I'D LIKE TO SEND
A TELEGRAM, PLEASE.

IMPRESSIVE SCENERY.

31:20.146 --> 31:23.249
OH--

32:09.461 --> 32:12.131
- ANYONE?
- ( distant shouting )

32:12.231 --> 32:14.066
I AIN'T NO TRESPASSER.

32:14.166 --> 32:17.669
- WHAT'S YOURS IS YOURS.
- ( men hooting )

32:18.804 --> 32:21.707
( noises continuing )

32:24.543 --> 32:27.046
( metal clattering )

32:29.781 --> 32:31.550
I AIN'T THE LAW!

32:31.650 --> 32:34.453
I AIN'T NO POACHER!

32:45.431 --> 32:47.599
( hollering )

33:20.999 --> 33:23.369
( grunts )

33:26.138 --> 33:28.074

33:33.912 --> 33:36.448

34:10.048 --> 34:13.252
COME ON.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.821

- ( Ben coughing )

34:40.812 --> 34:42.814
( sighs )

34:48.854 --> 34:51.190
( softly )
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

34:51.290 --> 34:54.860
YOU THOUGHT THE SEAMS

34:54.960 --> 34:57.863
WERE VEINS.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.779
- ( exotic music playing )
- Man: YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE,
HONEY.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.655
Man 2:
COME ON, GIVE IT A KISS!

36:04.296 --> 36:07.266
- ( snake hisses )

37:01.787 --> 37:05.557
HEY, THAT SHITSACK MONKEY

37:09.328 --> 37:11.363
( spits )

37:13.365 --> 37:16.435
( laughing )
LOOK AT THAT FUCKING MONKEY.

37:18.337 --> 37:21.540
ALL HE DOES IS
PISS AND SHIT.

37:52.203 --> 37:54.205
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

37:54.306 --> 37:56.375
AIN'T IT CLEAR?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.319
THAT'S ENOUGH NOW.

38:07.419 --> 38:09.355
LEAVE SOME FOR THE WORMS.

38:10.456 --> 38:13.759
I SAID THAT'S
E-GODDAMN-NOUGH!

38:31.810 --> 38:33.812
GO BURY HIM.

38:51.296 --> 38:55.200
DEEP!
NOT LIKE THE LAST ONE.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.369
THAT'S RIGHT, JOANNE.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.406
YOU A PRETTY LITTLE LADY,

39:00.506 --> 39:02.374
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

39:02.474 --> 39:05.744
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.816
Man:
INSIDE'S SHUT DOWN!

39:10.916 --> 39:12.851
( honks )

39:18.056 --> 39:21.527
Stumpy:
I'M SORRY
IT'S TAKEN SO LONG,

39:21.627 --> 39:23.795
BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING
TRIPLE-TIME

39:23.895 --> 39:27.533
- JUST TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.
- Bud: THAT'S SWEET.
WHERE IS IT?

39:40.612 --> 39:44.282
Bud:
WHERE'S THE REST?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.753
Stumpy:
LOOK, DO YOU
WANT A DRINK?

39:50.055 --> 39:53.191
- NEXT WEEK?
- NEXT WEEK.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.161
DON'T, UH...

39:57.529 --> 39:59.431
DON'T MAKE ME
TAKE MEASURES.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.300
- NO. HELL NO.
- NO.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.603
BUD, I WOULD NEVER
MAKE YOU DO THAT.

40:04.703 --> 40:07.238
- NO, NOT EVER.
- Bud: NO, OF COURSE.

40:07.338 --> 40:09.475
- NEXT WEEK, THEN?
- YES, SIR.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.710
THAT'S MIGHTY WHITE
OF YOU.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.846
WELL, HEY THERE,
LAMBCHOP!

40:14.946 --> 40:19.751
YOU REMEMBER BUD EVERHARD,
MY OLD PARTNER IN CRIME.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.754
- I DON'T BELIEVE SO.
- BUD AND I TRIED TO OPEN

40:22.854 --> 40:26.057
THAT CATHOUSE
ON THE RESERVATION
OUTSIDE ALBUQUERQUE

40:26.157 --> 40:28.059
ONCE UPON A TIME.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.961
IT WAS...
( laughing )

40:30.061 --> 40:34.132
I TOLD YOU THAT ONE.
I TOLD YOU THAT,
I'M SURE.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.934
I TOLD HER THAT ONE
50 TIMES.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.736
UH-HUH.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.471
I HAVE ANOTHER STOP
TO MAKE,

40:39.571 --> 40:43.041
BUT IT WAS A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU, MRS. DREIFUSS.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.944
NEXT WEEK.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.217
BEST EGG IN THE WORLD,
BUD EVERHARD.

40:52.317 --> 40:56.221
RAN INTO SOME HARD LUCK
RECENTLY WITH THIS WIDOW
HE TOOK UP WITH--

40:56.321 --> 40:58.356
HOW MUCH ARE YOU
INTO HIM FOR?

40:58.456 --> 41:01.292
NOW, YOU SEE,
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

41:01.392 --> 41:03.995
I GOT A TOUGH HIDE,
BUT SOMETIMES

41:04.095 --> 41:07.232
IT'S LIKE YOU AIM
TO HURT ME SOMETIMES.

41:56.381 --> 41:58.684
WHAT DO YOU WANT?!

42:12.631 --> 42:16.134
"I MAY NOT RETURN WITH THEE
AND NOR GO IN WITH THEE
BY THE BY,

42:16.234 --> 42:21.206
EAT BREAD WITH THEE
NOR DRINK WATER WITH THEE
IN THIS PLACE."

42:46.598 --> 42:49.200
OH, DEAR.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.336
GOODNESS!

42:51.436 --> 42:55.040
YES.
TERRIBLY CLUMSY OF ME.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.219
DOWN THERE.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.608
CELESTE?

43:56.134 --> 44:00.071
YOU LOOK AS IF
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PRAY.

44:00.171 --> 44:03.842
YOUR MOTHER TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO PRAY, DIDN'T SHE?

44:14.652 --> 44:18.189
- ( sighs deeply )
- ( zipper unzips )

44:19.557 --> 44:22.460
OH, MY DEAR, DEAR CELESTE.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.763
I WILL SHOW YOU THINGS.

44:24.863 --> 44:29.735
WONDERFUL, TERRIBLE THINGS.

44:58.496 --> 45:02.133
( panting )

45:41.840 --> 45:43.174
THAT'S IT?

45:43.274 --> 45:46.878
$3.28, A HOBO KNIFE
AND SOME GODDAMN BUTTONS?

45:48.246 --> 45:49.781
THAT DON'T HELP.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.483
SHE'S HOLDING OUT.

45:54.853 --> 45:57.255
HEY, COME ON.

45:57.355 --> 46:00.291
COME ON.

46:00.391 --> 46:02.527
COME ON!

46:04.830 --> 46:07.332
LOOK AT THAT.
I SAID.
YOU SEE THAT!

46:07.432 --> 46:09.500
IT'S SILVER.

46:14.639 --> 46:17.008
- OH, SHIT.
- WHAT?

46:22.647 --> 46:23.614
OH SHIT.

46:23.714 --> 46:26.017
HEY, ERN! ERN!
STOP!

46:26.117 --> 46:28.419
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DAMN IT!
- STOP!

46:28.519 --> 46:30.856
DIG!

46:35.660 --> 46:37.528
- COME ON, SET HIM DOWN.
- ( panting )

46:37.628 --> 46:40.565
( coughing )

46:40.665 --> 46:42.300
GO ON.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.802
YOU OKAY?

46:48.573 --> 46:52.177
LOOK AT THIS.
IS THIS YOURS?

46:53.644 --> 46:56.147
- HUH?
- YEAH, YEAH.

46:58.116 --> 47:01.319
SHE'S BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.055
YES, SIR.

47:05.423 --> 47:08.459
( wind gusting )

47:23.308 --> 47:25.343
WHO'S THERE?

47:33.985 --> 47:38.089
LODZ.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

48:06.417 --> 48:09.220
( classical waltz
playing )

49:03.941 --> 49:06.577
( door closes )

49:09.680 --> 49:12.117
( static )

49:29.100 --> 49:31.002
Justin's voice:
In lush green pastures

49:31.102 --> 49:33.471
the shepherd lies down
with his flock.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.206
But he does not sleep,

49:35.306 --> 49:37.442
forever vigilant
against the beast.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.877
The sheep are nothing
without the shepherd,

49:39.977 --> 49:42.147
but prey to the beasts
of the night.

49:42.247 --> 49:44.982
When the sheep gives its life
for the shepherd's table,

49:45.083 --> 49:47.752
there is no greater honor.

49:49.687 --> 49:52.990
( theme music playing )
