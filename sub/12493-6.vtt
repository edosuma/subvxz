00:10.240 --> 00:12.540
- Thanks for
the ride home, evan.
- Sure.

00:12.570 --> 00:14.510
You didn't mind sitting
through my practice?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.010
Oh, no no no,
not at all.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.380
You look cute
in your uniform.

00:18.410 --> 00:21.910
- I'm on the swim team.
- Yeah.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.180
- Hey.
- Oh, uh, evan,
this is my brother gabe.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.720
- <i>Gabe, this is evan.</i>
- Wait a minute.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.520
- Don't I know you
from somewhere?
- I don't think so.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.390
I've definitely
seen you before.

00:36.420 --> 00:37.990
Hey, why don't you go
check your room?

00:38.020 --> 00:40.690
Lots of really good
clues there.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.950
- I should get going.
See you tomorrow?
- Bye.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.720
Yeah.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.960
Oh god.
Thanks a lot.

00:47.940 --> 00:48.790
What did I do?

00:48.850 --> 00:51.400
He's been driving
me home every day
for the past two weeks.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.460
I think he was finally
going to ask me out

00:53.500 --> 00:55.630
Until you scared him off
with all your talking

00:55.670 --> 00:58.240
And pointing and-- ugh.

00:58.270 --> 01:02.210
I'm sorry,
but he looks familiar.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.709
Was he my camp counselor?

01:04.739 --> 01:06.940
No no no, he seemed
afraid of me,

01:06.980 --> 01:09.510
But not that afraid of me.

01:10.910 --> 01:14.180
Why would a totally hot guy
like evan know you?

01:14.220 --> 01:16.580
What's wrong with me?
Slegowart!

01:16.620 --> 01:18.720
You say things
like "slegowart."

01:18.750 --> 01:21.550
No no, slegowart
is a character in pokeo.

01:21.590 --> 01:25.120
That's how I know evan--
from the game store.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.890
Evan plays pokeo?

01:26.920 --> 01:30.060
That nerdy card game
with those stupid
cartoon creatures?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.300
No.

01:32.330 --> 01:35.500
Evan plays pokeo,
the fantasy card game

01:35.530 --> 01:39.900
That requires a keen level
of skill and strategy.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.740
But why would evan play that?
That's for little kids.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.810
Wigimon is for little kids.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.080
Pokeo is for nine and up.

01:50.350 --> 01:52.080
How is that possible?

01:52.110 --> 01:55.920
Now the cute hot guy
is a secret nerd?

01:55.950 --> 01:59.620
Well, many of us in the world
of fantasy card games

01:59.660 --> 02:02.620
Are considered
quite attractive.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.500
- Mom's home!
- Hey, honey!

03:20.530 --> 03:22.400
Hey, the banquet's tonight.
Did you rent me a tux?

03:22.430 --> 03:24.070
- It's right over there.
- Okay.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.830
Did you get me the one
that makes me look like
james bond?

03:25.870 --> 03:28.000
Yeah, honey, I got you
the magic tux.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.170
Mom, did you type my report?
You know, because of
my broken finger?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.510
- Yes, I typed your report.
- What's it about?

03:33.540 --> 03:35.040
- The civil war.
- What's my take?

03:35.080 --> 03:38.080
- Why don't you read it?
- No, that's the teacher's job.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.280
Mom, I'm hungry.
Is there anything to eat?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.650
What's that thing filled
with food right next to you?

03:43.680 --> 03:46.520
Dad?

03:46.550 --> 03:47.950
Hey, mom,
could you help out

03:47.990 --> 03:49.460
With my school car wash
on Saturday morning?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.060
Honey, that's my only day
off work.

03:51.090 --> 03:52.260
Perfect.
So you're free.

03:52.290 --> 03:53.760
All right,
bring your own chamois.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.800
Okay okay, stop.

03:55.830 --> 03:59.370
I need five minutes
of peace, please.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.670
That is a wonderful idea.
You just sit there and relax.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.710
Thank you.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.780
- I'm not seeing the bow tie--
- oh my-- okay, come on.
Let's go, charlie.

04:11.810 --> 04:15.250
You're the only one
who isn't annoying me
right now.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.950
There's no cover page.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.920
Boom.
( cooing )

04:21.959 --> 04:23.890
Where's my nose?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.660
That's my nose.
That's great.

04:25.690 --> 04:28.700
What else do you know?
Where's my ear?

04:28.730 --> 04:30.200
That's my ear.

04:30.230 --> 04:32.730
Where's my eye?

04:32.770 --> 04:35.240
Ow!  Ow.
Oh my gosh.

04:35.270 --> 04:38.340
- Wow, she got me.  Ow.
- What?

04:38.370 --> 04:40.180
Ow, charlie poked me
in the eye.

04:40.210 --> 04:44.010
Oh, I can't open my eye.
Bob, it really hurts.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.880
Mom, maybe you should
get it checked out.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.580
Teddy, I'm a nurse.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.090
I don't need you
to tell me

04:49.120 --> 04:50.850
When I need to get
something checked out.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.420
Bob, I need
to get this
checked out.

04:57.090 --> 05:01.160
Well, amy, it doesn't
look like your cornea
is scratched.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.000
I'm going to prescribe
some drops.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.540
Wear this eyepatch overnight
and you'll be good to go.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.270
You mean go,
as in go home?

05:09.310 --> 05:11.410
Well, that's good news,
isn't it?

05:11.440 --> 05:15.040
Well, home is where
the cooking and cleaning

05:15.080 --> 05:18.420
And laundry and homework
and husband and kids and--

05:18.450 --> 05:21.580
( crying )
I don't wanna go home.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.590
But there's nothing
wrong with you.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.990
- ( crying continues )
- well, with your eye.

05:27.030 --> 05:31.960
Can't you just
keep me overnight
for observation?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.770
Amy, as a nurse you know
that's not appropriate.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.370
This is not a hotel.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.270
You know what else isn't
appropriate, dr. Meyers?

05:41.310 --> 05:43.370
Telling people you're
working at the free clinic

05:43.410 --> 05:44.980
When you're really
playing 18 holes

05:45.010 --> 05:46.510
At the denver
country club.

05:48.350 --> 05:51.450
I think you'll enjoy
room 207.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.160
Where's mom?

06:01.190 --> 06:03.430
Oh no, she didn't
make it, did she?

06:03.460 --> 06:05.760
Your mom is going
to be fine.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.470
No, I'm talking
about the meatloaf.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.130
She didn't make it,
did she?

06:10.170 --> 06:14.310
You know, the concern
you have for the woman

06:14.340 --> 06:16.480
Who gave birth to you
is overwhelming.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.180
She was going
to wrap it in bacon.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.650
Really?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.350
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking about?

06:23.380 --> 06:25.180
I've got my banquet
tonight.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.550
Hey, you wanna
come with?

06:27.590 --> 06:31.660
Denver pest control
association puts on
quite a do.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.660
- I don't know.
- Why not?

06:33.690 --> 06:36.900
Because I had trouble
staying awake during
that sentence.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.730
Are you telling me
you don't wanna see
your old man

06:40.770 --> 06:42.670
Win the exterminator
of the year award?

06:42.700 --> 06:45.340
Oh right, that award
you think you're going
to win every year,

06:45.370 --> 06:47.570
But you don't because
murray always does.

06:47.610 --> 06:50.040
Look, there is no way
that the same guy

06:50.080 --> 06:52.040
- Can win every year.
- <i>Why not?</i>

06:52.080 --> 06:54.010
The same guy loses
every year.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.750
All right, you know what?
Enough about murray.

06:56.780 --> 06:59.320
Do you wanna see your father
win the award or not?

06:59.350 --> 07:02.560
Murray's my dad?

07:07.930 --> 07:09.560
- <i>( knocking at door )</i>
- teddy: <i>Mom?</i>

07:09.600 --> 07:12.360
Oh my--

07:14.070 --> 07:15.530
How are you feeling?

07:15.570 --> 07:18.640
- Oh, a little better.
- Yeah?

07:18.670 --> 07:21.270
But I miss you
and charlie and...

07:21.310 --> 07:24.710
The others.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.850
I'm glad one of us
is doing well.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.180
That's nice.

07:29.220 --> 07:31.520
Thank you for coming.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.520
Mom, I just got here.

07:33.550 --> 07:37.460
Oh right.  Ha.
Well, how are you?

07:37.490 --> 07:42.000
Well, actually
there's this boy evan

07:42.030 --> 07:44.070
That I really like,
but, um...

07:44.100 --> 07:46.700
I found out something
kind of disturbing about him.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.370
He's into pokeo.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.400
Pokeo?  That thing
gabe likes?

07:51.440 --> 07:54.070
Well, honey, what would
you see in a guy like that?

07:54.110 --> 07:58.580
Well, this is evan
at a swim meet.

07:58.610 --> 08:02.210
Yeah, that explains that.

08:02.250 --> 08:05.220
Well, honey,
no one's perfect.
Everyone has their flaws.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.750
You think I was thrilled
when I found out your
father was into bugs?

08:07.790 --> 08:09.950
But you got over it?

08:09.990 --> 08:14.690
Yeah, that's what I did--
got over it.

08:14.730 --> 08:17.060
Look, honey, relationships
are about compromise.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.560
If you really like
this guy,

08:18.600 --> 08:21.230
Try being interested
in things he's interested in.

08:21.270 --> 08:23.170
On my second date
with your father

08:23.200 --> 08:25.770
I threw out three facts
about bark beetles.

08:25.810 --> 08:28.810
Ha ha,
the man was mine.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.510
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.980
Mom, didn't you get poked
in the other eye?

08:36.020 --> 08:38.250
No no, it was--
it was this eye.

08:38.289 --> 08:39.990
I'm pretty sure
it was the other one.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.450
No no no no.

08:41.490 --> 08:44.660
Oh gosh,
let mama rest, dear.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.590
Let mama rest.
( groans )

08:51.600 --> 08:55.670
Okay, let's do this
one more time.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.140
I'm putting down
my dragony card.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.970
What's your
counterattack?

09:00.010 --> 09:02.670
Um...

09:02.710 --> 09:05.740
- Weepok?
- Weepok?

09:05.780 --> 09:09.180
You played a weepok
when you could have played
a scalamaster?

09:10.550 --> 09:14.790
Scalamaster-- that's--
that's the octopus dude

09:14.820 --> 09:16.320
With the suction cup
thingies?

09:16.360 --> 09:20.900
Vortexes.
They're called vortexes.

09:20.930 --> 09:22.830
You know what?
I can't work with you.

09:22.870 --> 09:26.000
You have no respect
for the mythical world
of dort.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.500
Oh no.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.770
Gabe, please, just give me
one more chance.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.340
Forget it.
Forget it.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.610
- This is hopeless.
- You're right.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.040
I feel like gasio going up
against misrod.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.340
Wait a minute.
That wasn't wrong.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.110
- It wasn't?
- No no.

09:42.150 --> 09:46.850
Gasio would have no chance
against misrod because?

09:46.890 --> 09:50.590
Because grass power
is no match for
volcano power?

09:50.620 --> 09:54.660
Yes yes yes!

09:54.690 --> 09:58.030
Wow, teachers really do
make a difference.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.640
- <i>( knocking at door )</i>
- bob: Honey?

10:15.220 --> 10:18.180
Honey?  Hey.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.720
How are you feeling,
sweetie?

10:19.750 --> 10:21.850
( mumbles )
I've been better.

10:21.890 --> 10:25.660
Well, I got something
that's going to help
cheer you up.

10:26.730 --> 10:28.690
Tada!

10:28.730 --> 10:31.100
Exterminator of the year!

10:31.130 --> 10:33.800
You won?
That is fantastic!

10:33.830 --> 10:35.440
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you!

10:35.470 --> 10:37.540
I gave a great big speech
and everything.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.210
- Aw, did you say
something nice about me?
- Of course I did.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.310
P.J., he got the whole thing
recorded on his phone.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.110
- Show her the speech.
- Yeah, let me see it.

10:44.150 --> 10:45.980
Dad, can I speak to you
outside for a second?

10:46.010 --> 10:48.880
- What?
- Yeah.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.590
- What the heck are you doing?
- Go go go.

10:53.790 --> 10:56.290
- You can't show mom
that video.
- Why not?

10:56.320 --> 10:59.060
- Because you don't thank her.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.

10:59.090 --> 11:02.600
- You don't even mention her.
- Of course I did.

11:02.630 --> 11:04.760
Let's take a look.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.770
Okay.  Oh, man,
where do I start?

11:07.800 --> 11:11.910
Oh yeah,
in your face, murray!

11:11.940 --> 11:13.680
Huh?

11:13.710 --> 11:15.580
<i>I want to--</i>

11:15.610 --> 11:17.080
You know what?
I want to--

11:17.110 --> 11:22.050
I want to thank my kids
p.J., teddy, gabe, charlie,

11:22.090 --> 11:25.550
Who make me want to work
so hard every day.

11:25.590 --> 11:29.730
Oh, and how about a shout-out
to all the bugs out there, huh?

11:29.760 --> 11:31.330
Without whom none of us
would be here.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.530
<i>( laughs )</i>

11:33.560 --> 11:35.730
Most importantly
I want to thank

11:35.770 --> 11:38.500
One very special lady
tonight--

11:38.540 --> 11:41.170
My waitress!
Iris!

11:41.200 --> 11:43.570
Keep 'em comin', baby!

11:43.610 --> 11:45.880
I'm a winner!

11:51.850 --> 11:55.120
Wow, that's not good.

11:55.150 --> 11:57.820
Oh man.

11:57.860 --> 11:59.690
What am I gonna do?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.390
- You could tell mom
the truth.
- Or?

12:05.130 --> 12:07.060
I could tell mom
the truth?

12:08.870 --> 12:10.870
Or?

12:12.270 --> 12:14.710
We could sneak out of here
and think of something later?

12:14.740 --> 12:17.140
Ding ding ding ding.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.880
Thanks again
for giving me a ride.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.720
Thanks again for waiting
till my swim practice was over.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.720
Thank me?
Thank <i>you.</i>

12:37.750 --> 12:41.160
- Same time tomorrow?
- Yeah, sounds good.

12:41.190 --> 12:43.960
- All right.
- Hey, could you
do me a favor

12:43.990 --> 12:45.790
And grab my keys
out of my backpack?

12:45.830 --> 12:47.660
Sure.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.570
You have pokeo cards?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
Oh no, you weren't
supposed to see those.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.640
I'm so embarrassed.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.840
Don't be.
I'm into pokeo too.

13:00.870 --> 13:02.770
Wait, what?

13:02.810 --> 13:06.480
I didn't want to
say anything because...

13:06.510 --> 13:08.280
I was afraid you'd
think I was weird.

13:08.310 --> 13:10.980
Wait, yeah, that's why
I didn't want to say
anything to you.

13:11.020 --> 13:14.050
My dream is to become
a level-four card master

13:14.090 --> 13:15.920
And earn
my gorgonic shield.

13:15.950 --> 13:18.260
That's my dream.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.790
Wait, what?

13:20.830 --> 13:23.030
Will you go out
with me?

13:23.060 --> 13:25.030
Does scalamaster
have vortexes?

13:25.060 --> 13:27.260
Yeah.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.870
Are you sure
this is going to work?

13:33.910 --> 13:37.610
Trust me, it's going
to look exactly like
your real acceptance speech.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.440
But you might want
to move charlie.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.180
Huh?  Oh okay.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.720
Come here, sweetie.
Come on.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.150
Let's help daddy
deceive mommy.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.690
Okay let's make
some magic, bobby.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.690
- Ready?
- Yeah.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.830
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.530
On.  Action!

13:55.560 --> 13:59.330
Hey hey!
Hey, okay, whoo.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.740
I have-- no.
No no no.

14:01.770 --> 14:03.270
( stuttering )
I want to--

14:03.310 --> 14:07.570
I want to thank my wife
amy b. Duncan.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.480
Cut.  Dad, you are
stiff as a board.

14:10.510 --> 14:13.510
- Help me.
- Show me some emotion.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.720
Okay.
All right, action.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.620
( crying )

14:17.650 --> 14:20.550
Thank you for this award.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.590
This is one
of the great moments
of my life.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.890
- ( ringing )
- cut.  I gotta take this.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.560
Hello?

14:26.590 --> 14:28.230
Oh no, I'm not
doing anything.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.400
What's going on?

14:36.370 --> 14:38.340
Sorry I had
to bring charlie
on our first date.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.840
I kind of thought
my mom would be out
of the hospital by now.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.780
Actually I'm excited
you brought her.

14:42.810 --> 14:44.440
She's going to make this
even better.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.350
Yeah, what is this anyway?
What are we doing?

14:46.380 --> 14:49.120
- We're going to larp.
- Larp?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.480
"larp" stands for
"live action role-play."

14:51.520 --> 14:53.320
Anyone can play pokeo
with cards,

14:53.350 --> 14:56.120
But when you
put on the costumes
and you act it out,

14:56.160 --> 14:57.620
It takes it
to a whole new level.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.960
Oh, you're joking, right?

14:59.990 --> 15:01.990
Oh, you're not joking.

15:03.430 --> 15:05.700
Guys, this is teddy
and charlie.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.200
Teddy and charlie,
this is slugmar,

15:08.230 --> 15:12.270
Weepok, scalamaster,
and gulagon.

15:12.300 --> 15:16.410
You brought girls.
We've never had girls.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.440
Okay.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.010
Well, since
we're not really dressed

15:21.050 --> 15:23.050
For the whole larping thing,

15:23.080 --> 15:26.520
Charlie and I are just
going to go sit over here
while you guys play.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.450
Oh, no no no, don't worry.
I thought of everything.

15:34.630 --> 15:38.770
And the best part is
we're out in public.

15:43.370 --> 15:46.570
Oh, bad news, mom.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.840
You got a b-
on my civil war report.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.680
Not your best work.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.910
I'll try harder
next time.

15:52.950 --> 15:58.280
So, honey,
ready to see
my big speech?

15:58.320 --> 16:00.420
That I shot
with my phone...

16:00.450 --> 16:02.690
At the hotel...

16:02.720 --> 16:04.360
The other night.

16:04.390 --> 16:05.990
Just hit "play."

16:06.030 --> 16:08.190
- <i>( applause )</i>
- <i>thank you, thank you,</i>
<i>thank you.</i>

16:08.230 --> 16:11.100
Thank you,
denver pest control
association.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.130
Not a very nice
hotel this year.

16:13.170 --> 16:16.700
Uh, it's budget cuts.
( clears throat )

16:16.740 --> 16:21.240
You know, winning
an award like this
is incredible,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.680
But I'm already a winner

16:23.710 --> 16:26.010
Because of
my wonderful wife amy.

16:27.550 --> 16:31.080
When I think about
this amazing woman...

16:32.850 --> 16:36.060
I get all emotional.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.120
Wait, what is that?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.160
P.J., rewind.

16:41.890 --> 16:43.900
There, pause.

16:46.370 --> 16:51.070
- Bob, what's going on?
- All right, look...

16:51.110 --> 16:53.770
( sighs )

16:53.810 --> 16:57.080
Honey, the truth is
in all the excitement
of that night

16:57.110 --> 16:59.510
With the award
and the lights--

16:59.550 --> 17:00.820
I don't know.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.990
I just-- I forgot
to thank you.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.490
And then we made the tape
to cover up the lie

17:07.520 --> 17:10.560
And I just--
I'm really really sorry.

17:10.589 --> 17:13.790
Look, bob, I really--
I appreciate the effort,

17:13.829 --> 17:15.760
But why did you have
to lie to me?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.900
I mean if we don't
have honesty,

17:17.930 --> 17:19.400
What do we have here?

17:19.430 --> 17:21.599
What do we have <i>here?</i>

17:22.740 --> 17:25.599
Mom, according to
your chart,

17:25.640 --> 17:28.470
It says there's nothing
wrong with your eye

17:28.510 --> 17:30.780
And you should have
gone home yesterday.

17:35.150 --> 17:38.580
Hey, you wanna pretend
the last minute of our lives
never happened?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.790
What last minute?

17:46.960 --> 17:50.090
Our two peoples have been
in conflict for many years.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.360
Boys: Mm.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.600
Today the final
battle begins.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.540
Chicapu is supposed to say,
"assume the positions

18:01.570 --> 18:03.370
And prepare for
the gorgonic war."

18:03.410 --> 18:07.240
- Charlie, say "go."
- go!

18:07.280 --> 18:10.050
Chicapu has spoken.
Let the battle commence!

18:10.080 --> 18:12.920
- Wardart, come quick!
- ( boy yelling )

18:15.150 --> 18:18.420
Ha!  Feel my wrath,
you knaves!

18:18.460 --> 18:22.600
Never!
Vengeance will be mine
in the name of gorgon.

18:22.630 --> 18:26.570
Hey, evan, evan,
what am I supposed to do?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.140
- Reality!
- For crying out loud.

18:29.170 --> 18:32.270
You can't call me
by my human name.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.580
- I'm slegowart.
- I'm sorry, slegowart.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.210
No, now I'm evan.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.750
Okay, guys, we've been
in reality for too long.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.420
Game on!

18:43.450 --> 18:44.950
Ooh!

18:46.050 --> 18:47.960
I am wounded.

18:47.990 --> 18:50.730
Chicapu, you're a worthy
adversary indeed.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.100
Quick, wardart,
throw your fireball.

18:56.130 --> 19:00.200
No, not at me.
No, not--

19:00.240 --> 19:03.510
Ha ha, dead!
You are dead.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.170
What is wrong with you?

19:06.210 --> 19:07.640
Well, you told me
to throw it.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.840
Not at me.
I'm out of the game now.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.150
Well, can't you just call
backsies or something?

19:12.180 --> 19:15.320
Backsies?
What are you, five?

19:15.350 --> 19:17.980
Oh, <i>I'm</i> five?

19:18.020 --> 19:19.850
You're the one
running around the park

19:19.890 --> 19:21.350
Dressed like a giant frog.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.660
( boys gasp )

19:23.690 --> 19:26.360
I am a magic toad.

19:26.390 --> 19:28.160
Yes yes, you are,

19:28.200 --> 19:29.960
Which means
I must now leave

19:30.000 --> 19:32.370
The mythical land
of nerdingham,

19:32.400 --> 19:33.900
For I have lost interest

19:33.930 --> 19:37.270
No matter how good
thou looketh in a swimsuit.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.910
Chicapu, away!

19:42.740 --> 19:44.680
Come here, you.
Okay.

19:44.710 --> 19:48.480
So you brought
that girl here
on a date?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.720
Yeah.

19:50.750 --> 19:56.290
So it's almost as if
I were on a date.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.840
Hey, charlie.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.840
Listen, when you
get to be my age,

20:08.870 --> 20:11.870
Don't pretend
to be someone you're not
just to impress a guy.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.710
I just learned that.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.280
I also learned that
if you walk home
from the park

20:16.310 --> 20:18.280
Dressed like
a giant chicken,

20:18.320 --> 20:20.580
You're going to be
chased by a dog.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.120
Hey, did you touch
my pokeo cards?

20:26.160 --> 20:28.590
- No.
- Liar!

20:28.630 --> 20:32.030
There's a bent corner
on my slugmar card.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.060
Mom!

20:37.270 --> 20:39.240
Oh, one more thing.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.040
If you fall for a guy
with something in common
with gabe,

20:42.390 --> 20:43.900
Good luck, charlie.

20:49.060 --> 20:51.470
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

20:56.170 --> 20:58.740
- Lewis!
- Hello, mr. D.

20:58.780 --> 20:59.840
Come on in.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.380
Hey, teddy,
lewis is here.

21:02.410 --> 21:04.480
Actually I came here
to talk to you, bob.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.950
- Can I call you bob?
- Can you?

21:07.990 --> 21:10.220
It would be my pleasure.

21:10.250 --> 21:13.160
Well, bob,
as you know

21:13.190 --> 21:14.960
I've been spending
a lot of time with teddy

21:14.990 --> 21:18.660
And things are going
very well.

21:18.700 --> 21:22.230
And amy and I are absolutely
thrilled about that.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.630
My future is bright, sir.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.170
I have a good part-time job
at the comic book store.

21:27.200 --> 21:31.070
- I own my own bike.
- I think I know where
this is headed.

21:31.110 --> 21:34.210
I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

21:34.240 --> 21:36.680
I'd like your permission
to ask teddy

21:36.710 --> 21:39.450
To be my g-girlfriend.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.680
- Welcome to the family, son.
- ( mouths word )

21:44.350 --> 21:46.920
Reality!

21:50.760 --> 21:53.630
Well, thank you
for the larp,
mr. Duncan.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.430
Just go wash
the car, lewis.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.130
Yes, sir.
