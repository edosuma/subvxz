00:02.625 --> 00:04.250
You sure school's
worth all this?

00:04.250 --> 00:06.875
Dan, I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up North

00:06.875 --> 00:08.542
and work in the DA's office
where everybody talks

00:08.542 --> 00:10.625
in flat Yankee vowels.

00:10.625 --> 00:12.000
Mom, what is this?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
It says
my scholarship was canceled.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.167
Tighten up!

00:16.167 --> 00:17.209
[all screaming]

00:18.000 --> 00:20.375
Six weeks?
I'll miss qualifiers.

00:20.375 --> 00:22.000
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.209
I have one now
for cheerleading.

00:24.209 --> 00:25.834
Cheerleading?

00:30.250 --> 00:32.333
- Oh.
- Hello, Marti.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.208
- Welcome to Cheer Town.
- I voted against you.

00:34.208 --> 00:37.000
- Democracy's a bitch.
- Apparently, so are you.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.084
Vanessa, I'm sure you remember
the famous coach Red Raymond?

00:40.084 --> 00:42.417
Just so we're clear,
I have a boyfriend.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.667
Things change.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.000
The Hellcats
are short on flyers

00:45.000 --> 00:46.167
at a crucial moment.

00:46.167 --> 00:48.125
Come Sunday,
you'll get bounced.

00:48.125 --> 00:50.125
I was a gymnast
up until high school.

00:50.125 --> 00:52.875
My mom was screaming
and hooting and hollering.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.084
I'd feel
her soul-sucking presence

00:55.084 --> 00:57.333
get wigged out
and fail the routine.

00:57.333 --> 00:59.875
You must be really
excited about seeing
Marti at qualifiers.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.500
It would be fun
to surprise her.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.291
Uh, your boyfriend's welcome,
of course.

01:03.291 --> 01:06.042
What? Dan?
Oh, no, we're just buds.

in life.

01:29.917 --> 01:33.125

Circle up, Hellcats!

01:33.125 --> 01:34.625
Do you feel it?

01:34.625 --> 01:37.125
Do you feel the weight?

01:37.125 --> 01:39.625
Today one squad
will qualify for regionals.

01:39.625 --> 01:44.291
No one in their right mind
thinks it's gonna be us.

01:44.291 --> 01:48.333
The university,
they've given us an ultimatum.

01:48.333 --> 01:52.084
Place at Nationals
or they will gut our program.

01:52.084 --> 01:53.583
Are you feeling the weight?

01:55.875 --> 01:57.209
[chuckles]

01:57.209 --> 01:59.041
Well, I'm not.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.458
I'm light as a feather

02:01.458 --> 02:05.125
because you are
champions of the spirit.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.209
You ignore the scoreboard.

02:07.209 --> 02:09.667

Exciting, huh?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.209
It's, uh...something.

02:44.209 --> 02:47.000
- Who're those guys?
- Memphis Christian.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.125
'The team to beat.'

02:49.125 --> 02:51.166
Not much for showing the skin,
are they?

02:51.166 --> 02:53.667
Well, Mem-Chris
is a religious school.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.500
Jesus is the wind
beneath their skirts.

02:57.917 --> 03:00.291
Savannah went there before
she transferred to Lancer.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.291
Charlotte,
I want to wish you luck.

03:09.083 --> 03:11.125
I heard Alice got hurt.

03:12.042 --> 03:13.209
Yeah, but we got
this new girl.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.250
- Marti.
- Yeah, I saw her.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.375
She's a moose.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.000
We're going to bury you,
so you should

03:18.000 --> 03:19.792
probably keep that luck
for yourself.

03:19.792 --> 03:23.667
- I don't believe in it.
- Still...I wish you the best.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.834
Okay, Cyclones, let's run that
again, like you mean it!

03:28.834 --> 03:31.041
'Five, six, seven, eight!'

03:33.041 --> 03:35.209
What'd Charlotte have to say?

03:35.959 --> 03:37.708
She wished us luck.

03:38.875 --> 03:39.959
[screaming]

03:39.959 --> 03:41.583
Oh, I'll be back.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.291
'Yo, Dan Patch!'

03:45.375 --> 03:47.583
You look amazing,
despite the fact

03:47.583 --> 03:49.583
that you're dressed
like a cheerleader.

03:49.583 --> 03:52.042
- That part's weird.
- It's not weird,
it's perverse.

03:52.042 --> 03:53.917
Been missing your fly moves
at Empire.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.291
- You seduced Rosalie?
- I tried.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.125
Ended up making sweet love
to myself by mistake.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.291
- Happens to the best of us.
- What can I say, you know?

04:01.291 --> 04:04.250
I need my wing woman
to keep my head on straight.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.834
Well, I've been studying
like a   banshee

04:05.834 --> 04:08.125
and training 24-7
for this thing.

04:08.125 --> 04:11.875
When things settle down,
you know, my time
will free up.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.750
Hey, you want to come
and hang with us?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.084
Sitting with
the cheerleaders?

04:15.084 --> 04:18.333
- Yeah.
- Lordy, am I even allowed?

04:19.291 --> 04:21.791
I'm new.
We'll just plead ignorance.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.000
(man on radio)
'Marti Perkins
to convention security.'

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
'Marti Perkins to security.'

04:26.000 --> 04:27.125
Yeah.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.000
Don't you understand?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.875
This is her
first cheer competition ever

04:32.875 --> 04:35.291
and she wants her mom here
for support

04:35.291 --> 04:37.000
but I can't let her know
I'm here

04:37.000 --> 04:39.083
if you don't let me backstage.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.917
Ma'am, we've paged
your daughter

04:40.917 --> 04:42.625
and she should be here
any minute.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.041
- Mom?
- Baby!

04:44.041 --> 04:46.042
Oh, I am so excited
to be here.

04:46.042 --> 04:48.625
I hope no one mistakes me
for a Hellcat.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.291
What are you doing here?
How did you find out
about this?

04:50.291 --> 04:53.250
Alice invited me,
but she's got me
sitting in the stands

04:53.250 --> 04:56.875
and I really think that
I should be backstage
with you.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.959
So would you
let this lady here

04:58.959 --> 05:00.792
know that it's okay
to let me through?

05:00.792 --> 05:02.166
Is there a problem?

05:03.250 --> 05:05.708
No problem.
Mom, you cannot be here.

05:07.458 --> 05:09.167
Why is Dan here?

05:10.875 --> 05:14.208
I'm-I'm dating
this cheerleader here.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.500
Baby, you look fine tonight.

05:17.583 --> 05:18.875
Okay, we're leaving.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.042
- I just got here!
- Now! Come on! We..

05:24.166 --> 05:25.875
Why did you say
we were dating?

05:25.875 --> 05:28.166
I was just taking
the heat off Marti.

05:28.166 --> 05:33.000
- It was a joke.
- Oh. I sometimes miss those.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.500
Anyway, you're Dan, right?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.792
- I'm Savannah Monroe.
- Yeah, charmed.

05:36.792 --> 05:39.542
I'm short on time, so please
keep your answers concise.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.208
You know Marti better
than I do. How much
trouble are we in?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.209
There was a scene
back in high school.

05:44.209 --> 05:46.083
Uh, her mom showed up
at a gymnastics event drunk--

05:46.083 --> 05:47.959
And vomited on her.
Yes, yes, I know all that.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.209
So you also know
what Wanda did

05:49.209 --> 05:51.167
the night before
Marti took her SATs

05:51.167 --> 05:53.000
'and what happened
at her high school graduation'

05:53.000 --> 05:54.125
and her 21st birthday--

05:54.125 --> 05:55.458
Okay, in 20 minutes

05:55.458 --> 05:57.208
we're putting Marti
out in front of a crowd.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.500
- What can I do to help her?
- Get rid of mom.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.209
'Marti's one of the most
capable people I've ever met.'

06:02.209 --> 06:05.125
You help get her head cleared,
she'll come through.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.166
Positive attitude.
I like the way you think.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.042
Good talk.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.000
I just don't understand,
Marti, why I can't stay.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.333
I can't have this argument
right now, please.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.375
I love you
and I am so proud of you

06:24.375 --> 06:26.166
and, Marti, Marti

06:26.166 --> 06:29.083
I wouldn't miss
one of your events for
the whole wide world.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.208
Look at that eyeliner,
you look like
a truck stop tranny.

06:32.208 --> 06:33.417
Mom!

06:33.417 --> 06:35.750
This is the first time
I've competed in anything

06:35.750 --> 06:36.875
since I quit gymnastics

06:36.875 --> 06:39.042
and my entire future
is on the line.

06:39.042 --> 06:41.084
Look, I, I can't focus on me

06:41.084 --> 06:43.084
when I have to deal
with things like being paged

06:43.084 --> 06:44.792
over the loudspeaker
to come manage you.

06:44.792 --> 06:47.166
I-I never asked you
to manage me.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.041
She loves you,
but you have to go.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.500

swap our time slot
with King College.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.000
So we'll take their place
on the last day
of competition.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.167
We got another shot
to qualify.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.083
I need that girl
I met at tryouts.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.000
The university
isn't screwing around.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.542
- They will cut our program.
- And the scholarships?

10:31.542 --> 10:33.250
Count on it.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.542
Head on straight.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.834
- How's Charlotte?
- Things look good so far.

10:41.834 --> 10:45.083
But the neurologist wants her
to stay just for observation.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.333
Have you seen her yet?

10:46.333 --> 10:48.542
After the CT scan is finished.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.917
My mom is with her now.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.083
We're here
as long as you need us.

10:53.083 --> 10:54.458
It looks like we're all set.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.417
So why don't you head on
over there, Savannah?

11:05.959 --> 11:09.209
Well, I've got to admit,
it's , uh, handy

11:09.209 --> 11:10.208
being in love with a doctor.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.291
You get all that
universal healthcare.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.166
[giggling]

11:16.959 --> 11:18.542
With benefits.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.041
Aren't you supposed
to be somewhere

11:29.041 --> 11:31.125
getting your head on straight?

11:47.458 --> 11:50.291
Hey, Char.
Hi, Mom.

11:54.084 --> 11:56.084
I'm gonna go get a coffee,
sweetheart.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.375
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.209
Are you feeling okay?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.084
Well, mom's here..

12:16.084 --> 12:18.125
...and she's the best
when you're sick.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.959
Where's dad?
Wait, never mind.

12:24.959 --> 12:27.167
No need to answer.
I know your head hurts.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.708
An accident like this really
puts things in perspective.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.417
It's been what..

12:37.417 --> 12:40.083
...almost a year since
we've all been in
the same room together?

12:43.084 --> 12:44.667
I miss my family.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.542
I'm pretty sure...all this..

12:53.000 --> 12:55.083
...isn't about you.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.458
- All set.
- That was quick.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.959
- Everything okay?
- Charlotte's great.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.542
She just needs some rest.

You talked to Wanda
since the incident?

15:26.083 --> 15:28.000
No time.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.667
And I felt kind of bad.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.959
I really bit her head off.

15:31.959 --> 15:34.625
- You need help
hiding the body?
- Nah, she regenerates.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.625
She means well. I mean..

15:38.625 --> 15:40.333
She doesn't wanna
make my life miserable.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.209
Yeah, it just kinda
works out that way.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.917
Manifest destiny.

15:43.917 --> 15:47.167
You know,
it takes two to tango.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.125
That is true.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.375
And when she's around,
I, I snap into caretaker mode

15:54.375 --> 15:56.458
and I can't help it,
so that's on me.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.667
No, but it doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.875
See, the end result
is always the same.

16:00.875 --> 16:02.750
Wanda makes a scene,
and I end up

16:02.750 --> 16:04.625
blowing the spelling bee
or taking my driver's test.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.875
- Space.
- From Wanda?

16:13.875 --> 16:15.625
- Yeah.
- Huh!

16:15.625 --> 16:19.000
- Good luck to you.
- Just a grace period.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.166
Until I can get this whole
schedule thing under control.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.125
It's teaching a pig to sing.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.708
It doesn't work
and it annoys the pig.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.834
- Oh, I love pig metaphors.
- Yeah.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.291
Now, can we, like,
slap some lipstick on it

16:28.291 --> 16:29.959
maybe cut off its ear
and make a silk purse?

16:29.959 --> 16:32.834
Okay, family goes
where it goes.
You can't control it.

16:32.834 --> 16:36.084

and I moved back home
to help out

all under one roof.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.917
It's a war zone. Yeah.

16:43.917 --> 16:45.208
You know,
we're tripping over ourselves

16:45.208 --> 16:46.500
getting in each other's way

16:46.500 --> 16:50.458
but...I guess if you
just sit back and you..

16:50.458 --> 16:52.167
...accept the messiness..

16:53.291 --> 16:55.209
...you can have
an excellent time.

You know, I'm really
glad this whole Zen-master
serenity thing

16:58.208 --> 17:02.042
is working for you, Dan Patch,
but it's not an option for me.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.541
I'll still help you
hide the body.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.041

of reading to do

17:24.290 --> 17:25.834
and a paper
on constitutional law.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.166
- What?
- You've got a visitor.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.583
She brought ribs.

17:36.084 --> 17:37.792
Mom?

17:37.792 --> 17:40.458
Why are you here?
Oh, and you brought food.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.458
The ribs are from Cozy Corner,
your favorite.

17:43.458 --> 17:46.291
- Mm-hmm.
- All is forgiven. Come here.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.959
I mean to tell you, we were
starting to get funny looks.

17:54.959 --> 17:58.125
And he really did
look like a hippie.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.291
So I told him,
if he wanted to see me again

18:01.291 --> 18:03.084
he had to lose
the soul patch.

18:03.084 --> 18:04.291

And..

18:04.291 --> 18:07.708

an hour later.

- She's actually fitting in.
- I'd give it time.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.583

18:20.583 --> 18:23.708
Any good dish
in the romance department?

18:23.708 --> 18:27.083
You know, I have
to imagine that a family
like the Hellcats

18:27.083 --> 18:29.125
can get a little
bit incestuous.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.583
Yeah, you got that right

to Lewis and Alice.

18:32.959 --> 18:37.208
Well, my advice to you
is to stick with it

beautiful babies.

- I'm a huge fan.
- Really?

you turned around

21:08.167 --> 21:11.125
Yeah, the same place,
uh, Justin Timberlake's
from, right?

21:11.125 --> 21:12.917
Oh, I love him.

21:13.834 --> 21:16.041
I would rock that body.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.375
[laughing]

21:22.125 --> 21:24.125
[instrumental music]

21:25.167 --> 21:27.917
Oh, this was
a delightful evening.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.083
I don't want it to end.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.667
Come on, Mom.
You know, I'll just,
I'll walk you to the car.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.208
Is this a sofa bed?

21:34.208 --> 21:37.875
Not a chance in hell.
Yeah, okay.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.167
[music continues]

21:45.625 --> 21:48.000
I can't go home.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.250
I know you get lonely.

21:49.250 --> 21:50.875
I'll-I'll just,
I'll drive you home

21:50.875 --> 21:52.083
I'll tuck you in,
we'll watch a bad movie.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.375
No, really, I can't go home.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.042
I came home from work,
and there is this

21:55.042 --> 21:56.375
big padlock on the front door.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.166
- You got evicted?
- I am not paying
for that car.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.625
Even if I could afford it
on principle.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.166
Car? W-what are you,
what are you talking about?

22:03.166 --> 22:05.500
You remember
that flood upstairs
last winter?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.209
You know the landlord,
Mr. Aziki?

22:07.209 --> 22:09.542
Yes, Mom. I sent in
your rent checks.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.959
Okay, he finally agrees

22:11.959 --> 22:14.500
to fix the water stains
on that kitchen wall.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.458
He wants to paint it eggshell.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.959
So..

22:18.959 --> 22:21.000
The wall has always been sage.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It matches the tablecloth

22:23.000 --> 22:26.959
but Mr. Aziki insists
on painting it a neutral color

22:26.959 --> 22:29.209
because, get this,
it's easier to rent

22:29.209 --> 22:30.917
and I'm still living there.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.875
I mean,
can you imagine the nerve?

22:32.875 --> 22:34.041
So the man raises his voice

22:34.041 --> 22:37.167
and I will not be talked to
with disrespect.

22:37.167 --> 22:39.333
And I pick up that paint can
and then I open the window--

22:39.333 --> 22:42.750
Wait, does this end with you
trashing our landlord's car?

22:42.750 --> 22:45.125
He said some very ugly things.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.708
No! Okay!
Okay, you know what?

22:48.708 --> 22:50.167
- You, you can stay.
- Ah.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.417
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,
on one condition.

22:52.417 --> 22:54.167
Tomorrow you sit down
with Mr. Aziki

22:54.167 --> 22:55.208
and you fix this on your own.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.125
Oh, how am I supposed
to do that?

22:57.125 --> 22:59.041
I mean, I don't have the money
to fix his stupid car.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.458
You're a big girl,
figure it out.

23:00.458 --> 23:01.750
But I don't have the--

23:01.750 --> 23:03.959
Otherwise you sleep
in a motel.

23:07.167 --> 23:09.542
- Do we have a deal?
- Oh.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.166
Deal.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.209
[sighs]

23:21.750 --> 23:26.041
Savannah!
I was just going to call you.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.291
You were? Why?
Is Charlotte okay?

23:28.291 --> 23:30.542
Doctor say she's fine,
but she's in pain

23:30.542 --> 23:33.125
and you just never know
with a head injury.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.083
Your dad and I
are holding a prayer circle

23:35.083 --> 23:38.000
for her on Saturday
if you would like to come.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.417
- Of course. I'll be there.
- Good, 10 a.m.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.959
Wait, that's our redo time
for qualifiers.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.458
Well, your sister's
not getting a redo.

23:52.084 --> 23:54.750
It's just a prayer, right?

23:54.750 --> 23:56.417
I mean, can't that be done
at any time?

23:56.417 --> 24:00.125
- I-I can make it by noon.
- Just a prayer?

24:00.125 --> 24:01.959
There are a lot of people
coming, Savannah.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.333
Pastor George
is making a special trip

24:03.333 --> 24:06.959
so if this is important
to you, you'll be here.

24:08.167 --> 24:10.083
We do hope
to see you tomorrow.

24:17.458 --> 24:21.084
Hey, hon, it's me.
I hope your day's going well.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.917
I got your message
about picking up dinner

24:22.917 --> 24:24.417
and I just thought that..

24:24.417 --> 24:25.500
[gasps]

24:25.500 --> 24:27.542
Oh, my gosh!

24:27.542 --> 24:31.042
Derrick, I'm gonna kill you.

24:31.042 --> 24:33.500
You know we shouldn't be
spending money on..

24:35.750 --> 24:38.041
...takeout food every night.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.500
So, um, I'm just gonna
pick up some veggies

24:41.500 --> 24:44.125
and make a stir fry

24:44.125 --> 24:47.083
with some buckwheat noodles
like you like.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.500
Okay. Love you.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.542
[instrumental music]

24:55.042 --> 24:56.083
[grunting]

24:56.083 --> 24:57.375
Oops.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.500
Again, Marti, lock your knees.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.042
Okay. Again.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.041
[instrumental music]

25:09.583 --> 25:12.125
Ooh! Oh!

25:12.125 --> 25:15.208
What's with you today?
Focus. Come on.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.583
Help.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.291
Oop, uh!

25:26.542 --> 25:28.041
[grunting]

25:31.333 --> 25:32.959
Who am I kidding?

25:32.959 --> 25:35.084
She's gonna die
a horrible death without me.

25:35.084 --> 25:36.583
What? Who's gonna die
a horrible death?

25:36.583 --> 25:37.708
[sighs]

25:37.708 --> 25:39.167
Who do you think?

25:39.167 --> 25:41.125
Marti, where are you going?

25:42.333 --> 25:45.375
[music continues]

26:01.167 --> 26:04.209
Mr. Aziki, you do realize
by locking my mother out

26:04.209 --> 26:05.125
you've violated the uniform

26:05.125 --> 26:06.917
residential landlord
and tenant acts?

26:06.917 --> 26:08.375
My baby's studying
to be a lawyer.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.875
I could have you arrested
for throwing paint on my car.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.041
We could file suit.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.041
Mutually assured destruction.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.959
But why go to the dark place?

26:19.083 --> 26:20.917
Where'd you get all that cash?

26:20.917 --> 26:22.250
Cash advance.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.500
This should cover the damage,
Mr. Aziki.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.375
Barely.

26:26.375 --> 26:27.834
On one condition, though.

26:27.834 --> 26:29.875
You paint the wall sage,
primer, two coats.

26:29.875 --> 26:32.167
- Sage.
- Mm-hmm.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.084
Agreed.

26:38.417 --> 26:42.042
Thank you, sweetheart.
You really came through.

26:42.042 --> 26:44.209
I, I don't want your thanks.

26:44.209 --> 26:45.041
I want you to pay me back.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.667
I want you to be responsible.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.375
I don't want to have
to save your ass
every day of our lives.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.208
- Got it?
- Got it.

26:51.208 --> 26:55.042
Yeah, so Alice was
saying that you're
gonna get a do-over

26:55.042 --> 26:57.458
for qualifiers?

26:57.458 --> 26:59.041
- She was?
- At dinner.

26:59.041 --> 27:00.667
She said
that the Hellcats are gonna

27:00.667 --> 27:03.667
get another chance
to go in front of the judges.

27:03.667 --> 27:06.667
Um, yeah, yeah, Vanessa tried,
but it, it didn't work out.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.834
Oh, but what about
your scholarship?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.083
I'll figure out something.

27:14.083 --> 27:17.084
Well, if anyone can
figure it out, it's you.

27:24.250 --> 27:27.167
Mom, come on.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.667
Of course, I do.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.667
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to support Charlotte

27:31.667 --> 27:34.041
in my own way.
The squad is depending on me.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.792
[door opens]

27:36.792 --> 27:38.750
Yeah, well,
they're my family, too.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.959
Right now
they're my only family.

27:41.959 --> 27:44.667
I made sure of that.

27:44.667 --> 27:47.084
Mom? Mom?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.750
[scoffs]

27:51.208 --> 27:53.166
Mom trouble?

27:53.166 --> 27:55.166
No, of course not.

27:57.084 --> 27:58.959
- You?
- Same.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.667
- I lied to my mom's face.
- [indistinct]

28:03.000 --> 28:04.959
[chuckles]

28:04.959 --> 28:06.458
You first.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.333
Well, my mom asked
about qualifiers

28:09.333 --> 28:11.792
and I told her
that they weren't happening.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.083
When she finds out..

28:14.083 --> 28:16.875
Yeah, it'll break her heart,
I know.

28:16.875 --> 28:21.250
I feel awful,
but she brings it on herself.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.291
I need to concentrate on me
this one time.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.458
And if she doesn't
respect that

28:25.458 --> 28:27.458
then she deserves
to get shut out.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.542
[instrumental music]

28:32.625 --> 28:35.084
What?

28:35.084 --> 28:36.625
I got shut out.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.417
Yeah?

28:40.291 --> 28:42.167
When I transferred to Lancer

28:42.167 --> 28:44.500
it was a huge betrayal
to my folks.

28:44.500 --> 28:45.625
Why?

28:45.625 --> 28:48.583
Memphis Christian
is my family's legacy school.

28:49.875 --> 28:51.291
My mom and dad met there.

28:51.291 --> 28:54.208
My grandfather spent 15 years
as vice chancellor

28:54.208 --> 28:56.125
and my great-grandmother
was the first woman

28:56.125 --> 28:58.000
ever admitted on campus.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.250
There's some serious pressure.

29:00.250 --> 29:04.125
So I went
...but after my freshman year

29:04.125 --> 29:05.708
I realized I wasn't growing.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.417
My sister and I
were homeschooled

29:08.417 --> 29:10.375
and it just felt
more of the same.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.542
There's a whole world
out there

29:11.542 --> 29:13.708
and I wasn't getting
to experience it.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.000
So without telling them

29:18.000 --> 29:20.417
I filled out
a Lancer application.

29:20.417 --> 29:22.125
The cheer scholarship
gave me the freedom

29:22.125 --> 29:24.333
to tell them no..

29:24.333 --> 29:26.208
...for the first time
in my life.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.417
You're happy, though, right?

29:29.417 --> 29:31.125
You should be glad about that.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.084
Lancer is a secular school.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.084
When I came here,
I didn't just

29:37.084 --> 29:39.084
turn my back
on my family history.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.417
They think
I turned my back on God.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.542
They think I'm partying
and screwing around
every night.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.291
Have they met you?
Have they seen your bedspread?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.458
It's a coverlet, and they're
not exactly open-minded.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.291
I'm really sorry, Savannah.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.500

30:11.750 --> 30:13.625
She may not have
the best way of showing it

30:13.625 --> 30:17.291
but trust me,
the alternative is worse.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.291
So are you gonna
do something about it?
