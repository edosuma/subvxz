01:46.567 --> 01:48.533
- A wise man once said,

01:48.533 --> 01:52.166
"Life is an adventure
in forgiveness."

01:52.166 --> 01:55.900
Now, you might rank bungee jumps
off a bridge in New Zealand

01:55.900 --> 01:58.333
or bachelor parties in Vegas
a few notches higher

01:58.333 --> 01:59.967
on the adventure ladder,

01:59.967 --> 02:02.400
but think about
the risks involved.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.900
You could climb
to the mountaintop of attrition

02:04.900 --> 02:08.633
only to get shot down by
a victim who refuses to forgive.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.400
Think about the rewards.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.867
A chance to heal
those nasty wounds,

02:12.867 --> 02:15.300
reconcile with someone you love.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.567
Huh.
Now, that I think about it,

02:17.567 --> 02:19.166
forgiveness might knock
bungee jumps

02:19.166 --> 02:23.300
and bachelor parties
off the charts.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.734
- It's okay.
Take a break.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.166
Cutler's a suicide, huh?

02:35.166 --> 02:38.934
- That's what Reimondo's saying,
and I ain't disagreeing.

02:38.934 --> 02:42.433
- I didn't imagine you would.
- So, now what, Vern?

02:42.433 --> 02:44.266
Is there someone else
who needs to commit suicide

02:44.266 --> 02:45.834
before I get some respect?

02:45.834 --> 02:47.667
- Jesus Christ, Robson,
you made your point, all right?

02:47.667 --> 02:48.834
Shut the fuck up and spot me.

02:53.133 --> 02:56.200
And...one!

02:56.200 --> 02:58.567
Come on!
Come on!

03:01.033 --> 03:03.633
- Miguel, sit down.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.800
- What'd I do?

03:09.800 --> 03:12.166
- Well, that's what
I'm wondering.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.734
Tell me about your relationship
with Wolfgang Cutler.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.500
- Cutler?
Nazi guy?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.066
We didn't have a relationship.

03:18.066 --> 03:20.834
Dome-head was
an equal-opportunity racist.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.133
- So, it would surprise you

03:22.133 --> 03:23.567
if he left you something
in his will?

03:23.567 --> 03:26.533
- He left me something?
Like what?

03:26.533 --> 03:28.133
- Like everything he owned.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.867
- What?

03:29.867 --> 03:32.767
- You are the sole beneficiary
of all his worldly goods,

03:32.767 --> 03:35.166
both in Oz and on the outside.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.400
His house, his car,

03:38.400 --> 03:41.734
hell,
his 1942 Indian motorcycle.

03:41.734 --> 03:43.200
- Get the fuck out of here.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.033
- The will is signed
and notarized.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.367
- Are you shittin' me?

03:46.367 --> 03:48.500
I barely even spoke
to the fucking guy,

03:48.500 --> 03:50.400
a couple of times at rehearsal.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.800
That's it.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.300
The guy had any wife, kids,
family, anything?

03:55.300 --> 03:57.233
- Wife, no kids.

03:57.233 --> 04:00.633
- Ahh.
This is fucking crazy.

04:00.633 --> 04:04.600
- So, we packed up his cell,
put all his belongings in a box.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.533
You're gonna have to decide
what you want to keep.

04:06.533 --> 04:10.166
- I'm not gonna look through
a dead guy's things.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.066
Jesus.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.100
- I guess we'll have to wait
till the afterlife

04:22.100 --> 04:23.500
to find out why Cutler
would up and give

04:23.500 --> 04:26.533
his belongings
to a fucking wetback.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.934
- Yo, I'm as bugged out as you.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.900
I mean, I know you guys
spent a lot of time with Cutler.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.400
Did he ever mention anything
about me?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.400
- Uh, yeah,
in his sleep at night.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.667
He'd whisper your name.
Fuck off.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.767
- I'll suggest this now,
Alvarez, or I'll find a way

04:41.767 --> 04:44.133
to make it happen later,

04:44.133 --> 04:45.967
you sign all his stuff over
to his wife.

04:45.967 --> 04:47.266
- I already thought about that.

04:47.266 --> 04:50.500
- Don't think, spic.
Do.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.667
- You know what,
maybe I should give

04:51.667 --> 04:54.033
all his assets to you, Roby,

04:54.033 --> 04:56.300
being that you already
gave him your ass.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.400
- Cunt.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.567
You miss me?
I've been missing you.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.300
- What happened to you
the last few months?

05:31.100 --> 05:32.333
Things got a little hectic.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.867
But now I'm back on track.

05:37.867 --> 05:41.066
God damn, Leez,
you look good.

05:49.767 --> 05:53.433
Beat me off, baby.
Beat me off.

05:53.433 --> 05:54.934
Will you relax?
What the fuck is your problem?

05:54.934 --> 05:57.400
- Let go of me!
- Sit down, now!

05:57.400 --> 05:59.233
- Let go of me,
you cocksucker!

05:59.233 --> 06:00.433
- What'd you just call me?

06:00.433 --> 06:02.600
- Cocksucker!

06:02.600 --> 06:04.767
- Don't you ever call me
that again, ever!

06:04.767 --> 06:06.467
- Robson, what's your problem?
- I am not a cocksucker!

06:06.467 --> 06:08.266
- Fuck!

06:12.066 --> 06:13.767
Fuck!

06:53.233 --> 06:55.133
- I'm at a Chinese restaurant.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.100
My fortune cookie says,

06:57.100 --> 07:00.533
"Whoever opts for revenge
should dig two graves."

07:00.533 --> 07:02.600
- I hate Chinese food.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.266
- Shut the fuck up, Hank.
- "Shut the fuck up, Hank."

07:05.266 --> 07:08.967
- My brother's an annoying
little prick, but I forgive him.

07:08.967 --> 07:13.000
Why?
'Cause we only get two choices.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.500
Forgive or die a slow death.

07:19.633 --> 07:23.133
One of them studies doctors do
shows that carrying around

07:23.133 --> 07:25.200
the baggage of anger
and bitterness

07:25.200 --> 07:27.800
can put you at risk
for mental illness,

07:27.800 --> 07:31.967
for depression and anxiety,
as well as strokes,

07:31.967 --> 07:34.734
heart disease,
and heart attacks.

07:39.233 --> 07:40.400
- Who knew?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.433
Forgiveness is good
for your health.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.266
- Everybody's attention, please.

07:51.266 --> 07:54.367
Can I have your attention,
please?

07:54.367 --> 07:56.900
When Augustus Hill died,

07:56.900 --> 07:59.734
we thought we lost him forever,
but we didn't.

07:59.734 --> 08:02.367
He wrote a book

08:02.367 --> 08:04.934
about his life here,

08:04.934 --> 08:07.300
about your lives,

08:07.300 --> 08:10.700
and Kareem Said's last great act

08:10.700 --> 08:13.667
was to get
Augustus' book published.

08:13.667 --> 08:18.667
Now, when Kareem died,
the book could've died with him,

08:18.667 --> 08:20.800
but it didn't

08:20.800 --> 08:26.000
because of the hard work
and the dedication of these men.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.200
I want you all to share
in their triumph.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.333
- Here you go.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.133
- Fuck, man.

09:19.133 --> 09:20.734
All right, already.

09:20.734 --> 09:21.967
Yo, quit fuckin' with me!

09:21.967 --> 09:23.934
- Rawls, Rawls! Take it easy.

09:23.934 --> 09:25.767
You have any idea
how much this machine costs?

09:25.767 --> 09:28.033
- Yo, I'm doing something wrong.

09:28.033 --> 09:30.800
- Don't touch it.
I'll get Arif.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.033
We got big trouble.

09:37.033 --> 09:39.300
One of the guys are having
problems with something

09:39.300 --> 09:40.900
I couldn't help him with.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.734
You might want to go take
a few minutes and check it out.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.200
- I don't have a few minutes,
Jamal.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.266
You can see that, can't you?

09:46.266 --> 09:48.100
- Would it help to hire someone
from the outside

09:48.100 --> 09:50.066
to do the accounting?

09:50.066 --> 09:51.800
- And pay them with what?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.300
You see that figure on
the bottom right, right there?

09:54.300 --> 09:57.433
That's our gross so far,
1/5 of what it should be.

09:57.433 --> 10:00.100
With all due respect
to Kareem Said,

10:00.100 --> 10:03.367
taking on Hill's book pro bono
wasn't a sound business plan.

10:03.367 --> 10:05.734
- Us paying minimum wage
is the problem.

10:05.734 --> 10:08.000
A small cut, which would
still be far above

10:08.000 --> 10:10.433
what prisoners usually make,
might be the best solution.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.767
- And defeat the whole purpose
of this operation?

10:12.767 --> 10:13.967
No.

10:13.967 --> 10:15.433
- What is the purpose exactly,
to run

10:15.433 --> 10:17.734
a successful company,
or humiliate Burr Redding?

10:30.433 --> 10:33.200
- Prisoner number 01R934,

10:33.200 --> 10:35.233
Reginald Rawls.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.667
Convicted January 10, 2001,

10:47.667 --> 10:49.000
aggravated assault.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.233
Sentence: 12 years,

10:51.233 --> 10:54.367
up for parole in 4.

10:54.367 --> 10:58.567
- First, telemarketing,
now bookbinding?

10:58.567 --> 11:00.400
Ain't exactly
the kind of prison life

11:00.400 --> 11:02.200
you hear about on the street.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.233
- All right, game's over.

11:05.233 --> 11:09.467
I want you two back with me
in Degenhart's company.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.400
Poet put you up to this,

11:11.400 --> 11:15.367
following him to work
for the Muslims.

11:15.367 --> 11:17.934
Well, in case you forgot,

11:17.934 --> 11:19.800
you answer to me.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.900
- We do?

11:21.900 --> 11:25.300
Kenaniah, we still answer
to Mr. Redding here?

11:25.300 --> 11:29.066
- You two begged like bitches
to get a place in my clan.

11:30.934 --> 11:32.333
I gave you shelter.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.633
I showed you the ropes.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.467
And this is the thanks I get.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.000
- Please.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.834
We were your foot soldiers,

11:40.834 --> 11:44.166
day and night
running tits and shit.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.633
Now, you turn around
and want us to do work

11:46.633 --> 11:50.300
that's just plain fuckin' work?

11:50.300 --> 11:53.233
Kiss my ass, old man.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.133
- Preach that shit, Reggie.

12:04.133 --> 12:06.767
- You know it, nigga.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.033
Give me that,
give me that.

12:08.033 --> 12:09.367
Boom!

12:10.667 --> 12:14.000
- So, Redding,
you wanted to see me.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.200
About what?

12:16.200 --> 12:19.433
- Well, when I told you fellas
I was giving up the tit trade,

12:19.433 --> 12:21.533
you didn't believe me.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.400
- No, we didn't.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.800
- Well, now you can see
that my words are righteous.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.100
I got involved in this
telemarketing business

12:30.100 --> 12:33.400
to keep my boys from slinging,

12:33.400 --> 12:35.500
but it's not working,

12:35.500 --> 12:37.300
and I need your help.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.967
If you see Poet, Rawls,
or any of the others dealing,

12:41.967 --> 12:45.567
I want you to squash 'em,
squash 'em hard.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.066
- You want us
to kill your own men?

12:47.066 --> 12:50.734
- Not kill, demobilize.

12:50.734 --> 12:54.300
Weaken 'em until they
have to come back to me.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.300
- Looks like you got yourself
a deal.

13:10.133 --> 13:14.300
- Yo, I am done toting
and lifting heavy machinery.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.200
We need to get back
to slinging drugs.

13:18.200 --> 13:22.667
- I hear ya, Reggie,
but the timing ain't right.

13:24.367 --> 13:26.700
- Man, I would love
to take that dago down.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.600
- You will, yo, you will.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.066
But not yet, though.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.834
We got to play this
real smooth, real smooth.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.000
- Hey, guys.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.767
Y'all want ball?

13:36.767 --> 13:39.433
- Drop dead, Omar.

13:49.100 --> 13:52.834
- Prisoner number 03I462,
Lemuel Idzik.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.633
Convicted February 2, 2003,

13:56.633 --> 13:58.066
murder in the second degree.

13:58.066 --> 14:00.000
Sentence:
Life imprisonment

14:00.000 --> 14:02.767
without the possibility
of parole.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.600
- You'll be staying here in J,
at least temporarily,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.233
until we see how
the rest of the population

14:07.233 --> 14:09.900
adjusts to you being around.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.233
There's your nest.

14:17.467 --> 14:20.066
- Good to see you there, Warden.

14:29.033 --> 14:31.367
I'm Alvin Yood.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.400
Friendly type, huh?

14:55.700 --> 14:58.967
- Arif, I just heard
the motherfucker

14:58.967 --> 15:02.734
that killed Said
is coming to Oz.

15:02.734 --> 15:04.367
- He's already here.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.266
- Here?

15:06.266 --> 15:09.033
Well, what we gonna do?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.033
- Do?
- Yeah, yeah. Do. Do.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.166
What are we doing to do?
I mean, you know.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.333
We gotta whack his white ass.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.200
- No!

15:16.200 --> 15:18.767
- What's the matter, Arif,
ain't you got the balls?

15:18.767 --> 15:21.633
- I promised the warden
no harm would come to Idzik,

15:21.633 --> 15:24.967
and no Muslim
would seek revenge.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.133
- Like I said, no balls.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.166
- Listen to me.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.633
I saw Kareem Said get shot.

15:32.633 --> 15:35.900
I held him in my arms
as he died.

15:35.900 --> 15:40.033
The last words he said were,
"Don't harm him."

15:40.033 --> 15:43.300
Now, as hard as it is
not to do something,

15:43.300 --> 15:46.700
I will respect and obey
the Minister's wishes,

15:46.700 --> 15:48.667
and you will do the same.

15:51.500 --> 15:56.367
- Don't you be ordering me
around, motherfucker.

15:56.367 --> 15:59.567
You don't own me,
you understand?

15:59.567 --> 16:02.700
Not one little bit of me.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.667
- Mail call.

16:17.533 --> 16:18.734
How's the new guy?

16:18.734 --> 16:20.567
- Marathon talker.

16:30.300 --> 16:34.500
- The Brotherhood is grateful
for what you did to Said.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.900
Them Muslim bastards
start to hassle you,

16:36.900 --> 16:39.567
you just let me know,
we'll take care of them.

16:39.567 --> 16:42.767
- I am a Jew.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.600
- A Jew.

16:46.900 --> 16:51.266
Well, I've always said there's
some good use for you people.

16:51.266 --> 16:54.100
So explain.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.734
Why the fuck
did you kill him?

16:55.734 --> 16:57.734
Some Israeli-Palestine thing?

16:57.734 --> 16:59.200
- Water.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.133
Cold water.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.700
- Huh?

17:02.700 --> 17:04.867
- You put cold water in a...

17:04.867 --> 17:07.800
let's say a teapot,

17:07.800 --> 17:11.567
turn the stove on,

17:11.567 --> 17:13.133
the water gets hot, right?

17:13.133 --> 17:17.166
At some point it gets as hot
as it will ever be, blistering.

17:17.166 --> 17:22.033
Meanwhile, the stove is off,
the water starts to cool,

17:22.033 --> 17:24.867
until eventually it's cold.

17:24.867 --> 17:27.567
That's the way things work
in the universe,

17:27.567 --> 17:31.667
cold, hot, cold.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.333
- You should've pleaded
insanity.

17:46.834 --> 17:49.400
- Omar, you wanted to see me?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.066
- Y-yes, sir.

17:53.700 --> 17:57.500
I am hereby
and officially requesting

17:57.500 --> 18:00.567
a face-to-face meeting
with Lemuel Idzik.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.667
- Ah, that would be a no.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.667
- Wait, wait, wait,
hear me out, hear me out.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.100
- He killed Said.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.567
I'm not gonna give you a chance
to return the favor.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.100
- I'm not going to hurt him.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.066
- Yeah, that's what you say now,
but what will you say

18:10.066 --> 18:12.667
when you stand over his dead
body with a shank in your hand?

18:12.667 --> 18:14.367
Not gonna happen.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.367
- Fuck!

18:41.100 --> 18:44.567
- So, if forgiveness
is so good for us,

18:44.567 --> 18:46.633
why don't we do it more?

18:46.633 --> 18:49.100
- Same reason I don't eat tofu.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.533
It tastes like shit.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.033
- There are two reasons
we hold back.

18:53.033 --> 18:56.100
First, accountability.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.567
As long as we're still in pain,
we need someone to blame.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.000
What can you do
with all that pain

19:01.000 --> 19:03.400
if you've let the bastard
off the hook?

19:03.400 --> 19:05.900
Second, identity.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.000
Without this rage
consuming me,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.600
without this resentment,
this bitterness,

19:11.600 --> 19:13.667
who am I?

19:13.667 --> 19:16.233
- And finally, the Correctional
Officers Association

19:16.233 --> 19:18.900
is holding their annual
awards dinner and banquet

19:18.900 --> 19:20.467
here later this month.

19:20.467 --> 19:23.266
- How come we always have
to host these fuckin' things?

19:23.266 --> 19:25.266
- That attitude, Claire,
is why you probably

19:25.266 --> 19:27.500
won't be taking home a trophy
again this year.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.467
Don't forget,
it's black tie and evening gown.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.700
Okay, let's make
a good showing.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.567
All right, that's all for today.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.000
- An evening gown.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.333
- I can't wear
an evening gown.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.800
- I don't even own one.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.033
- Warden, can I have a minute?

19:46.033 --> 19:47.667
- Sure.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.100
- I've been a CO a lot of years,

19:51.100 --> 19:55.934
and in that time I've done
some things I regret.

19:55.934 --> 19:57.934
- We all have, Sean.

19:57.934 --> 20:00.200
Occupational hazard.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.066
- Yeah, well, what I mean is
that we spend a lot of time

20:03.066 --> 20:05.867
trying to get the prisoners
to rat each other out,

20:05.867 --> 20:08.333
yet when it comes to us,
there's this...

20:08.333 --> 20:10.233
code of silence.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.233
- Which you're about to break.

20:12.233 --> 20:13.233
- Yeah.

20:13.233 --> 20:15.567
- I don't envy you right now.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.800
Who?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.133
- Dave Brass.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.734
- He killed Carlos Martinez?

20:25.734 --> 20:28.367
- No, no, no, but Dave lied
about talking to Martinez

20:28.367 --> 20:29.867
the night he died.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.633
There was no
death bed confession.

20:31.633 --> 20:34.066
Martinez never
implicated Morales

20:34.066 --> 20:35.533
in the cutting
of Dave's tendons.

20:35.533 --> 20:37.633
- So, that's the real reason
you asked me to move

20:37.633 --> 20:39.100
Morales to the hospital.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.066
- I still think the dink
is guilty.

20:41.066 --> 20:42.433
- But there's no proof.

20:42.433 --> 20:46.400
We dumped him
in solitary unjustly.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.400
- Worse.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.066
Dave, Claire Howell,
and myself, we...

20:52.066 --> 20:55.033
we're the ones
who cut up Morales' ankles.

21:03.734 --> 21:06.400
- I suspected that Brass
was involved

21:06.400 --> 21:08.300
and that Howell allowed it
to happen.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.667
But you, Sean...

21:09.667 --> 21:11.133
- Dave was my pal, you know?

21:11.133 --> 21:13.567
Morales fucked up his life
forever.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.533
- Okay.

21:17.533 --> 21:19.233
Thank you.

21:19.233 --> 21:20.667
- That's it, thanks?

21:20.667 --> 21:23.200
- I'll discipline
the three of you,

21:23.200 --> 21:27.000
but how exactly
I don't know yet.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.467
- Right.

21:28.467 --> 21:31.834
- Sean?
- Yeah?

21:31.834 --> 21:34.600
- It takes balls,
what you just did.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.200
- Well, I didn't become
a zoo keeper

21:36.200 --> 21:38.166
just to behave
like one of the animals.

21:44.567 --> 21:46.734
- Put it into your mouth.

21:46.734 --> 21:48.667
- Morales.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.633
I'm releasing you from solitary,
permanently,

21:53.633 --> 21:55.767
putting you back
in Emerald City.

21:55.767 --> 21:56.967
- Why?

21:56.967 --> 21:59.000
- I don't need to give a reason,
do I?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.934
That might make me think twice.

22:00.934 --> 22:03.200
- All right, forget the why.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.367
Hey, Warden,

22:07.367 --> 22:10.934
what do you know
about Nurse Grace?

22:10.934 --> 22:12.467
- Know about her?

22:12.467 --> 22:13.967
Nothing,

22:13.967 --> 22:15.333
except she's worked here
for years.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.700
- If I were you,
I'd check her background.

22:18.700 --> 22:22.834
- What, she's medically
incompetent?

22:22.834 --> 22:24.266
- I'm afraid.

22:24.266 --> 22:26.100
Afraid?

22:26.100 --> 22:27.567
You?

22:27.567 --> 22:28.834
Of her?

22:28.834 --> 22:31.266
- Yeah.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.834
- Must be the medication
you're on.

22:43.867 --> 22:47.367
- Hey, Rebadow.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.967
- What do you want?

22:49.967 --> 22:51.567
- Didn't I give you
all the money

22:51.567 --> 22:54.033
that was left
from that lottery?

22:54.033 --> 22:57.066
- Too late to save my grandson.

22:57.066 --> 22:59.500
- You blame me,
but you shouldn't.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.300
- Who then?
- Morales.

23:02.300 --> 23:05.700
He had Martinez cut me,
which screwed with my head,

23:05.700 --> 23:07.133
which made me take off
with your winnings.

23:07.133 --> 23:10.700
He's the bastard
you should hate.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.934
- There's room in my heart
for both of you.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.600
- Yeah?

23:15.600 --> 23:18.367
Well, Morales is on his way
back to Em City,

23:18.367 --> 23:21.500
and I got fined
and suspended,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.367
a solid month, no pay,
no benefits.

23:23.367 --> 23:25.033
You think I can afford that?

23:25.033 --> 23:28.066
I just got married
for Chrissake.

23:28.066 --> 23:30.300
- I'll repeat my question.

23:30.300 --> 23:34.233
What do you want,
for me to feel sorry for you?

23:34.233 --> 23:36.800
No chance.

23:42.834 --> 23:45.934
- Fuck you, Murphy.

23:55.266 --> 23:58.100
- So, you happy?

23:58.100 --> 24:00.433
Brass gets his ass handed
to him,

24:00.433 --> 24:04.166
we lose a week's vacation,
all for what,

24:04.166 --> 24:06.700
Enrique fucking Morales?

24:06.700 --> 24:08.900
- For the truth, Howell,
for justice.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.300
- Justice.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.300
Justice, my pink ass.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.133
Oh, call the blood banks.

24:16.133 --> 24:18.834
Here comes another
bleeding heart.

24:24.900 --> 24:27.433
- So, Leo told me
all the gory details.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.533
- I'm sorry, Tim.
- You're sorry?

24:29.533 --> 24:32.033
I bring you into Oz
because we've known each other

24:32.033 --> 24:35.633
since sixth grade,
because you're the one person

24:35.633 --> 24:39.767
in my entire life
that I can trust

24:39.767 --> 24:42.767
with my life, if necessary.

24:42.767 --> 24:46.166
But then, see,
I find out I can't trust you,

24:46.166 --> 24:48.166
that you're just another
thickheaded,

24:48.166 --> 24:51.734
redneck slug who uses his badge
as a weapon.

24:51.734 --> 24:53.166
- You're right,
you're absolutely right.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.200
- Don't you fuckin'
agree with me!

24:55.200 --> 24:57.734
I'm telling you to fuck off!

25:00.433 --> 25:03.834
- Listen, I've betrayed
your trust.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.734
If you don't see me
getting it back,

25:05.734 --> 25:07.767
maybe I should just transfer out
of Em City.

25:07.767 --> 25:08.900
- What?

25:08.900 --> 25:10.533
- Maybe I should
just quit altogether.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.233
- No. Jesus!

25:12.233 --> 25:14.934
Jesus, stop being
so fuckin' remorseful!

25:14.934 --> 25:16.266
- What, you don't want me
to be remorseful?

25:16.266 --> 25:18.266
- No, yes!

25:28.533 --> 25:29.934
We're going to dinner tonight.

25:29.934 --> 25:31.800
You're paying.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.266
- Okay.

25:37.367 --> 25:43.033
- Sean, I'm proud of you
that you stepped forward.

25:43.033 --> 25:46.633
It means I can
still trust you.

25:55.066 --> 25:57.867
- Morales?

25:57.867 --> 26:01.333
Morales...

26:01.333 --> 26:04.266
I'm sorry to disturb you.

26:04.266 --> 26:07.433
That sedative I gave you
was pretty strong, huh?

26:07.433 --> 26:09.200
- Yeah.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.333
- It's a precaution.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.633
You're a big fella.

26:13.633 --> 26:14.934
I didn't want to struggle.

26:14.934 --> 26:16.734
- Struggle?

26:16.734 --> 26:18.500
- Martinez was so weak,

26:18.500 --> 26:22.867
he couldn't fight me,
but you...

26:22.867 --> 26:24.834
Say your prayers, Enrique.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.200
- No, don't.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.667
- You're just like Martinez,

26:27.667 --> 26:30.300
a nasty man
who deserves to die.

26:40.133 --> 26:41.367
- Knock, knock.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.767
- Hi.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.066
Can you say, "Who's there?"

26:45.066 --> 26:48.433
- Might be a while before
she can say Agamemnon Busmalis.

26:48.433 --> 26:52.133
Oh, God, she's gorgeous.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.700
Hi.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.266
Thank you.

26:58.266 --> 27:01.633
Oh, that fresh smell
of baby skin,

27:01.633 --> 27:03.367
in Oz of all places.

27:03.367 --> 27:05.467
Can I touch her?

27:05.467 --> 27:07.700
- Of course.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.600
- Can I keep her?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.266
- How about we share?

27:17.266 --> 27:20.166
Ruby needs a father, Agamemnon,

27:20.166 --> 27:22.400
and I need you back.

27:24.533 --> 27:28.133
Agamemnon, will you marry me?

27:28.133 --> 27:30.300
- What?

27:30.300 --> 27:33.400
You're proposing to me now?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.734
- Is that a yes?

27:35.734 --> 27:38.934
- I think so.

27:38.934 --> 27:40.800
Yeah.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.133
Oh, my God, yes!
- Yes.

27:46.266 --> 27:47.834
Oh...

27:47.834 --> 27:49.734
- Oh, you little doll.
- Yes.

27:49.734 --> 27:52.266
Little doll.

27:52.266 --> 27:55.033
- I can't work
in the library anymore.

27:55.033 --> 27:56.133
- What?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.467
Why not?

27:57.467 --> 27:59.500
- I'd rather not get
into the specifics.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
- Given that I run this place,
I need specifics.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.033
Something happen
I should know about?

28:04.033 --> 28:05.166
- No.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.100
- Trouble with other inmates?

28:07.100 --> 28:10.200
- No.
- Is it Stella?

28:13.700 --> 28:15.633
Are you two having problems?

28:15.633 --> 28:16.734
- No.

28:16.734 --> 28:17.867
- Well, what is it then?

28:17.867 --> 28:20.033
Did you forget
the fuckin' alphabet?

28:30.133 --> 28:32.033
- I don't want
to get Robert in trouble,

28:32.033 --> 28:34.166
but I thought you should know.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.800
- It's not like Rebadow
to just stop showing up,

28:36.800 --> 28:40.800
though he did come to me asking
to be switched to another job.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.767
You have any idea why?

28:44.767 --> 28:47.233
- No.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.133
- He's probably still depressed
about Alex Jr.

28:50.133 --> 28:52.000
- Who?

28:52.000 --> 28:54.166
- His grandson.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.100
He died last year of leukemia.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.800
- His grandson?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.734
Of leukemia?

29:00.734 --> 29:04.333
- I didn't say anything
when I initially came to you.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.467
I thought that the library
would be a good place

29:06.467 --> 29:09.133
to distract his mind
from his misery.

29:09.133 --> 29:11.266
Anyway, he'll be there tomorrow.

29:13.266 --> 29:15.600
- So, I did good by you
with "ball four"?

29:15.600 --> 29:17.066
I hit a home run.

29:17.066 --> 29:19.533
- I like the beaver shooting,
where the players

29:19.533 --> 29:21.367
drilled the holes
in the door of the hotel room

29:21.367 --> 29:23.033
and watched
the stewardess fuckin'?

29:23.033 --> 29:25.033
- Yeah, well,
it's fun for the guys,

29:25.033 --> 29:27.867
but how would you like
to have been on the other side?

29:27.867 --> 29:30.700
What they did
was an invasion of privacy.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.266
- Oh, whatever.
- Whatever.

29:33.266 --> 29:37.533
Now, this is a very good book
about women.

29:37.533 --> 29:39.967
And I thought something
wilderness-based,

29:39.967 --> 29:43.233
"Into Thin Air," might be
a nice antidote to Oz.

29:43.233 --> 29:45.467
- Do I look like
a fuckin' Boy Scout?

29:45.467 --> 29:46.800
- Scout, no.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.934
Boy, yes.

29:49.934 --> 29:52.233
I'll just be a minute.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.433
Robert, I'd like to talk to you.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.600
When I told you
about my breast cancer,

30:03.600 --> 30:07.467
I wasn't asking you to watch me
waste away and die, Robert.

30:07.467 --> 30:11.734
I don't need you for that,
if that's what you're afraid of.

30:17.433 --> 30:19.533
I know about Alex Jr.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.200
This isn't that.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.233
I know you're thinking you can't
go through the grief again,

30:28.233 --> 30:30.900
but what if you're missing
the chance

30:30.900 --> 30:34.266
to go through the joy,
the joy of being there

30:34.266 --> 30:36.633
for someone who is
going to make it?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.166
According to Blake,
they go hand in hand,

30:41.166 --> 30:45.233
joy and grief, "piping down
the valleys wild," remember?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.667
Stop being an asshole.

30:57.166 --> 30:58.533
- If she's talking to you,
old man,

30:58.533 --> 31:00.433
show some respect
and talk back.

31:00.433 --> 31:01.700
- That's enough, Pablo.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.667
Take your book,
we're done for today.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.000
- 70 times 77.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.900
Jesus said
that's how many times

31:43.900 --> 31:46.100
you're supposed to forgive
your brother.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.133
- Hank and I are still working
on seven.

31:49.133 --> 31:51.867
Meanwhile, an innocent man
nailed to a cross

31:51.867 --> 31:54.467
with iron spikes
says while dying,

31:54.467 --> 31:56.734
"Forgive them, Father.

31:56.734 --> 31:59.266
They know not what they do."

31:59.266 --> 32:02.967
Kind of raises the stakes
for the rest of us, huh?

32:07.533 --> 32:09.967
- Officer Schwartzmyer says
on the night of the murder,

32:09.967 --> 32:11.266
you started screaming.

32:11.266 --> 32:13.333
- I had a bad reaction
to the medicine.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.934
- As he came over
to check you out,

32:14.934 --> 32:18.033
someone snuck in the private
room and stabbed Mayor Loewen.

32:18.033 --> 32:19.767
- The medicine
was giving me hives.

32:19.767 --> 32:22.400
- Mr. Kelsch,
Dr. Nathan tells us

32:22.400 --> 32:24.967
you weren't having a negative
reaction to the medicine.

32:24.967 --> 32:26.867
- I couldn't stop itching.

32:26.867 --> 32:28.700
- You want to know what I think?

32:28.700 --> 32:30.300
I think you were paid to
distract

32:30.300 --> 32:32.567
Officer Schwartzmyer
from his post.

32:32.567 --> 32:35.000
- The scratching
was driving me crazy.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
- That makes you
guilty of murder.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.300
That means you go
to death row.

32:39.300 --> 32:40.300
- Huh?

32:40.300 --> 32:41.900
Death row?

32:41.900 --> 32:43.467
For hives?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.000
- Okay, Brandt, here's the deal.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.367
We now know you're guilty
of killing Wilson Loewen.

32:59.367 --> 33:00.934
- That's a lie.

33:00.934 --> 33:03.066
- We have statements
from two of the other inmates

33:03.066 --> 33:04.734
who were in the ward that night.

33:04.734 --> 33:06.800
They say they saw you
get out of bed

33:06.800 --> 33:07.800
and go into Loewen's room.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.200
- They're lying.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.834
- We also have a confession
from Lionel Kelsch

33:11.834 --> 33:15.166
who says you offered him $1,000
to distract the officer on duty.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.834
- He's a liar.

33:16.834 --> 33:18.500
- Okay, we'll play it your way.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.667
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.800
- Aryans are gonna be so pissed
when they hear you're guilty

33:22.800 --> 33:24.500
of killing their hero.
- Anything you say

33:24.500 --> 33:26.166
may be used
against you in a court of law.

33:26.166 --> 33:29.100
- Without my protection,
you'll be dead within the hour.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.133
- You have the right to a lawyer
before speaking to me.

33:32.133 --> 33:35.400
- All right.
All right, all right.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.633
I'll tell you who hired me.

33:37.633 --> 33:41.333
It was that CO,
what's his name?

33:41.333 --> 33:42.734
Johnson.

33:51.800 --> 33:55.200
- Johnson, how's it going?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.934
- Not bad, sir, and you?

33:56.934 --> 33:59.033
- The usual brouhaha.

33:59.033 --> 34:03.767
Hey, I hear you just
bought a car, Jaguar.

34:03.767 --> 34:05.066
- Yup.

34:05.066 --> 34:06.767
- That's a beautiful automobile.

34:06.767 --> 34:08.934
Pretty pricey on a CO's salary.

34:08.934 --> 34:11.667
- My wife's maiden aunt kicked.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.433
She left us a little dough.

34:13.433 --> 34:15.633
- Nice.

34:15.633 --> 34:18.233
Willy Brandt.

34:18.233 --> 34:19.734
- What, sir?

34:19.734 --> 34:23.033
- Willy Brandt confessed
to the murder of Wilson Loewen.

34:23.033 --> 34:25.500
- Congratulations.

34:25.500 --> 34:28.100
How did you manage
to get that thing to spill?

34:28.100 --> 34:30.333
- The truth?

34:32.333 --> 34:33.967
We lied.

34:33.967 --> 34:36.000
We told Brandt
that we had two witnesses,

34:36.000 --> 34:38.633
which we don't,
and that his partner confessed,

34:38.633 --> 34:40.400
which he didn't.

34:40.400 --> 34:41.934
- Brilliant.

34:41.934 --> 34:43.633
- Oh, here's the good part.

34:43.633 --> 34:46.333
Brandt claims that you offered
to pay him $5,000

34:46.333 --> 34:49.667
to waste Wilson Loewen.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.233
Not that I believe him
or anything.

34:52.233 --> 34:53.800
- No, sir.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.834
He's a lying piece of shit.

34:55.834 --> 34:57.533
- Right.

34:57.533 --> 35:00.333
Well, good night.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.533
Enjoy that car.

35:18.266 --> 35:20.567
- Hey, it's me.
We got a problem.

35:20.567 --> 35:22.367
Glynn knows I set up the murder.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.300
What do you want me to do?

35:26.767 --> 35:28.367
Okay.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.800
- He brought the devil in here,
your son.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.433
Do you hear me?

35:37.433 --> 35:41.133
Your baby boy
got butt-fucked by Satan,

35:41.133 --> 35:43.967
and now we're all gonna burn,

35:43.967 --> 35:46.500
you fuckin' bitch!

35:49.533 --> 35:51.467
- I'm an idiot.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.734
I thought by talking to the man
who killed Timmy,

35:53.734 --> 35:56.600
I would get to know more
about my boy,

35:56.600 --> 35:59.667
that I would understand how
he became the man he became.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.867
- Well, like I said,

36:01.867 --> 36:04.100
Jazz Hoyt isn't very coherent
these days.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.834
He's been ruled mentally insane
by the court of appeals.

36:06.834 --> 36:09.200
Tomorrow they're moving him up
to the psych unit.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.333
- So, what do I do now?

36:10.333 --> 36:12.734
How do I calm this guilt
inside of me?

36:12.734 --> 36:14.500
And don't tell me to pray.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.900
I've prayed so hard
my knees hurt.

36:17.900 --> 36:20.934
- Well, when praying stalls,
I usually try to imagine

36:20.934 --> 36:23.533
what my dad would've done
in the situation.

36:23.533 --> 36:27.266
That's an excellent idea.

36:27.266 --> 36:29.934
Do you drink, Father?

36:29.934 --> 36:31.300
- Ah, sure.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.633
- Good.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.800
I'll go into town,
I'll get us a quart of Jameson's

36:34.800 --> 36:36.567
and sit in the dark
and drink until dawn,

36:36.567 --> 36:38.667
'cause that's how my dad would
have handled the situation.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.500
- Mrs. Kirk, I-I...

36:40.500 --> 36:43.367
- I'm joking, Father.

36:43.367 --> 36:46.266
Call me Jessica.

36:46.266 --> 36:47.934
- Call me Ray.

36:47.934 --> 36:50.467
- Ray...

36:50.467 --> 36:52.900
Like a ray of sunshine.

36:58.567 --> 37:02.166
I think what I should do
is what I should've done

37:02.166 --> 37:05.100
when Timmy was alive,
and that's volunteer

37:05.100 --> 37:07.700
to work at Oswald,

37:07.700 --> 37:10.934
help men like my son
become better people.

37:10.934 --> 37:12.934
- Volunteer?

37:12.934 --> 37:14.233
What would you do?

37:14.233 --> 37:15.834
- I'm a nurse.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.433
I bet they could use some help
in the hospital ward.

37:17.433 --> 37:19.066
- Yes.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.900
- You'll set that up for me,
Ray?

37:20.900 --> 37:22.367
- Of course.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.934
- Thank you.

37:26.934 --> 37:30.133
I consider you
my really good friend.

37:41.567 --> 37:43.633
- Morning, kiddies.

37:43.633 --> 37:46.333
- Do I have to go get more ECT?

37:46.333 --> 37:48.033
- Later.

37:48.033 --> 37:51.166
Come on, Hoyt,
time to move you up to psych.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.133
Hoyt!

38:00.834 --> 38:03.033
- What the fuck?

38:03.033 --> 38:04.967
I'm bleeding.

38:07.367 --> 38:08.500
- He'll sleep.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.600
I sedated him.

38:11.600 --> 38:13.700
- He's got no cuts
on his forehead.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.200
What's causing the bleeding?

38:15.200 --> 38:19.834
- A rare condition
called hematidrosis.

38:19.834 --> 38:21.233
Underneath the skin
there are these

38:21.233 --> 38:23.700
tiny blood vessels,
capillaries.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.567
When people are stressed,
they sweat, right?

38:26.567 --> 38:29.633
Well, sometimes
under extreme stress

38:29.633 --> 38:31.567
the capillaries hemorrhage,

38:31.567 --> 38:34.734
releasing small amounts of blood
into the sweat glands.

38:34.734 --> 38:37.433
Hoyt is literally
sweating blood.

38:39.934 --> 38:42.300
- "And being in fear,
he prayed more earnestly,

38:42.300 --> 38:44.667
"and his sweat became
like great drops of blood,

38:44.667 --> 38:47.433
which fell upon the ground."

38:47.433 --> 38:51.333
Luke 22:44, the agony
of Christ in Gethsemane.

38:54.233 --> 38:56.667
- Jesus and Jazz,

38:56.667 --> 38:59.633
I didn't know they had
so much in common.

39:08.133 --> 39:09.900
What's the matter with him?

39:09.900 --> 39:12.567
- Side effects
of the electric shock.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.500
- I threw up on myself.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.633
- Oh, poor Cyril.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.467
Clean him up
and then admit him.

39:21.467 --> 39:22.900
- I was going to give him
some Emetrol

39:22.900 --> 39:24.400
and send him back
to death row.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.967
- Well, he spent enough time
up there.

39:25.967 --> 39:27.500
He could use
a change of scenery.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.900
- All right, but I'm putting him
in restraints.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.700
- Hey, Gloria.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.834
Hey, thanks a lot for letting
my brother, you know,

39:41.834 --> 39:43.033
chill out in the hospital ward.

39:43.033 --> 39:44.333
It means a lot to me.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.166
- Well, that's okay.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.600
- Yeah.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.300
Hey, we just heard that, yeah,

39:51.300 --> 39:56.734
his latest appeal has
been denied and the lawyer's

39:56.734 --> 39:59.367
gonna plead his case
to the state supreme court,

39:59.367 --> 40:02.367
but, you know, unless
a fuckin' miracle happens,

40:02.367 --> 40:05.066
I think Cyril's going
to be executed next week.

40:15.133 --> 40:17.166
- I have to go.

40:17.166 --> 40:20.667
- Hey, Gloria,

40:20.667 --> 40:22.600
I never stopped loving you,

40:22.600 --> 40:25.200
not for a second.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.133
- Excuse me.

40:38.266 --> 40:39.834
Excuse me.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.567
Excuse me.

40:46.367 --> 40:49.133
- Don't you fuckin' ignore me.

40:49.133 --> 40:52.700
You think because I'm slow that
I don't know what's going on.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.200
- I have to go to the bathroom.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.834
- Listen to me,
you fuckin' asshole,

40:59.834 --> 41:02.200
I'm gonna shit in my pants.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.834
- Help me.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.900
- Too late.

41:16.834 --> 41:21.333
Hey, you gonna leave me
lying here in my own shit?

41:24.667 --> 41:27.467
both: Hey!

41:27.467 --> 41:28.767
- What's the matter?

41:28.767 --> 41:31.233
- I had an accident.

41:31.233 --> 41:34.934
- Not again.

41:34.934 --> 41:36.667
Machelo?

41:38.433 --> 41:40.433
Can you give me a hand
over here, please?

41:48.900 --> 41:52.333
- Okay, I'm here.
What's the reason?

41:52.333 --> 41:57.467
- Mr. Neema, your reputation
on the street is,

41:57.467 --> 42:00.700
well, it's massive.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.000
Back in the day
with the Black Panther thing,

42:03.000 --> 42:06.600
and since then with
the community development and--

42:06.600 --> 42:09.400
- I know my own resume.
Get to the point.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.800
- Well, you see, sir, we've
been a little leaderless lately.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.834
Burr Redding's off on some
telemarketing ego trip.

42:17.834 --> 42:20.967
- Yeah, and you want me
to take over.

42:20.967 --> 42:23.133
- Shit, yeah.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.934
- You fellas know
why I'm in Oz?

42:28.934 --> 42:31.734
- For kidnapping or some such.

42:34.700 --> 42:38.300
- I picked up my daughter
from day care.

42:40.700 --> 42:43.333
My ex-wife was intending
to leave this country,

42:43.333 --> 42:46.133
thereby depriving me
of my rights to see my child,

42:46.133 --> 42:48.934
and I love my children,
gentlemen,

42:48.934 --> 42:52.000
every single one,
and I got 16.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.967
- Maybe it's your turn
to get to the point.

42:54.967 --> 43:00.700
- None of my children do drugs,
sell drugs, or hang in gangs.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.967
Each lives a life
of their own choosing,

43:02.967 --> 43:06.433
contributing as best they can
to make a better world.

43:06.433 --> 43:09.467
My children are my pride

43:09.467 --> 43:13.834
because they make me proud.

43:13.834 --> 43:16.200
So, rather than use
this classroom

43:16.200 --> 43:20.633
as a place to plot your plans,

43:20.633 --> 43:24.133
use it for a real purpose,

43:24.133 --> 43:27.200
to learn.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.667
End of sermon.

43:29.667 --> 43:31.967
End of discussion.

43:39.467 --> 43:41.300
- Thanks.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.000
Hey, stranger, haven't seen
much of you lately.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.433
- Yeah, well, you know,
you've been busy.

43:48.433 --> 43:50.600
With the play,
your boyfriend.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.667
- Boyfriend?
- Jahfree Neema.

43:52.667 --> 43:54.934
I see you here,
I see you there,

43:54.934 --> 43:57.200
laughing, whispering.

43:57.200 --> 43:58.734
It's very sweet, very intimate.

43:58.734 --> 44:00.166
- Ryan, come on.
- What?

44:00.166 --> 44:02.066
You gonna tell me
I'm imagining it,

44:02.066 --> 44:03.867
that my eyes deceive me?
- No.

44:03.867 --> 44:05.500
- You asked me
to be nice to the guy.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.667
I tried, he blew me off.

44:07.667 --> 44:10.600
You know, I know you think
he's some sort of hotshot savior

44:10.600 --> 44:14.100
and all, but to me he's just
another fuckin' wanker.

44:14.100 --> 44:15.734
You two enjoy yourselves.

44:15.734 --> 44:18.667
Meanwhile, my little brother's
gonna die.

44:18.667 --> 44:20.734
- Ryan.
- What?

44:20.734 --> 44:24.633
- Promise me you won't
do anything to harm Jahfree.

44:24.633 --> 44:27.233
- Oh, gee, Ma,

44:27.233 --> 44:30.100
you really think I'm capable
of something like that?

44:38.600 --> 44:41.633
- Neema, I know we haven't had

44:41.633 --> 44:43.367
much of a chance to talk
since you arrived here--

44:43.367 --> 44:44.400
- That's probably because
we have

44:44.400 --> 44:46.433
nothing to say to each other.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.767
- Well, look, I know
on the outside you and me,

44:48.767 --> 44:50.200
we was never that friendly,
but--

44:50.200 --> 44:51.667
- Friendly?

44:51.667 --> 44:56.000
Redding, you are anathema to me.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.567
- See, there you go using
them big words,

44:57.567 --> 45:00.200
think you're going to curl me,
but it don't.

45:00.200 --> 45:02.166
- For the past
30-something years,

45:02.166 --> 45:04.300
you've been supplying
the children of our community

45:04.300 --> 45:07.000
with lethal drugs
while I have fought

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
to keep those
same children safe.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.100
And now, just because
we both find ourselves

45:12.100 --> 45:15.400
in this clap shack, you want
to believe that we have a bond.

45:15.400 --> 45:18.266
We don't.
- We do!

45:18.266 --> 45:22.033
I've seen the error of my ways,
and I'm trying to correct them.

45:22.033 --> 45:25.066
- I don't believe you.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.834
- You know, Burr,
that Neema,

45:30.834 --> 45:33.066
he's a pompous
piece of shit, man.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.433
I say it's time he learned
who's the boss around here.

45:36.433 --> 45:38.233
- You want him dead, O'Reily?

45:38.233 --> 45:41.333
- I wouldn't weep if he was.

45:41.333 --> 45:44.967
- If you really  want
to do Neema some harm,

45:44.967 --> 45:47.834
tie him to your mother's crime.

45:47.834 --> 45:50.266
- What do you mean?

45:50.266 --> 45:51.700
- You're a clever boy.

45:51.700 --> 45:53.767
You figure that one out.

45:58.367 --> 46:01.166
- Who's the hardest person
of all to forgive?

46:01.166 --> 46:02.700
Oneself.

46:02.700 --> 46:05.400
The demons inside,
they laugh at the thought.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.500
- When you forgive
some other guy,

46:07.500 --> 46:09.266
he's not likely to turn you
down, say, "Fuck that."

46:09.266 --> 46:11.700
- Tryin' to forgive yourself,
though,

46:11.700 --> 46:13.233
it's "Fuck that" all the time.

46:13.233 --> 46:16.233
- Ten years go by, you still
can't let yourself off the hook.

46:16.233 --> 46:18.667
- 15 years, 20, 40.

46:18.667 --> 46:20.934
You gonna take that grudge
against yourself to the grave?

46:20.934 --> 46:23.166
- You gonna carry it for
eternity?

46:30.266 --> 46:32.000
- Well, well, well.
Agent Taylor.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.033
Are you here to visit me?

46:33.033 --> 46:35.200
- Fuck you, Keller.

46:35.200 --> 46:39.033
- Aww, G-man,
don't get grumpy.

46:39.033 --> 46:41.233
You're the one who made
the deal with Heekin.

46:41.233 --> 46:42.600
You're the one
who got him to fib.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.033
- He saw you dump the body.

46:45.033 --> 46:46.867
- Hey, wasn't it
J. Edgar Hoover who said,

46:46.867 --> 46:48.200
"Cheaters never prosper"?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.133
- Careful there, sir.

46:52.133 --> 46:54.533
- You killed two other men,
Keller,

46:54.533 --> 46:57.400
and I'm gonna get you
for one of them.

47:09.767 --> 47:12.200
- Henry Stanton?
I'm Tobias Beecher.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.867
Sister Peter Marie
suggested I come see you.

47:14.867 --> 47:17.367
- You're the one doing
pro bono work, right?

47:17.367 --> 47:18.867
- Yeah, that's right.

47:18.867 --> 47:20.934
- Helping the prisoners
with legal shit and such.

47:20.934 --> 47:22.767
Well, I hurt my back
doing sanitation duty

47:22.767 --> 47:24.400
a few months ago.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.500
Dr. Nathan told me not to do
anything too strenuous.

47:27.500 --> 47:30.033
I told my COs and they put me
right back to work again

47:30.033 --> 47:33.300
because they think I'm faking,
but I'm not.

47:33.300 --> 47:36.166
In fact,
they give me harder work.

47:36.166 --> 47:39.767
I complain to my unit manager,
nothing changes.

47:39.767 --> 47:42.233
And the other day
I screwed up my back again.

47:42.233 --> 47:46.400
- Uh...
Well, off the top of my head,

47:46.400 --> 47:49.033
it appears the COs
violated your rights

47:49.033 --> 47:51.734
under the eighth amendment,
deliberate indifference.

47:51.734 --> 47:54.767
Let me talk to Dr. Nathan,
the officers involved,

47:54.767 --> 47:57.500
and Warden Glynn,
let me see what I can do.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.533
Meanwhile, take it easy.

47:59.533 --> 48:00.900
Back injuries suck.

48:00.900 --> 48:02.500
- Thanks a lot, man.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.433
- Stanton is not lying, Leo.

48:04.433 --> 48:06.333
I gave him the proper
medical documentation

48:06.333 --> 48:07.767
at least three times.

48:07.767 --> 48:09.834
- Okay, the COs screwed up.

48:09.834 --> 48:11.266
They will be reprimanded.

48:11.266 --> 48:13.133
- That's not good enough.

48:13.133 --> 48:15.066
I've got a rock-solid case here,
Warden.

48:15.066 --> 48:16.834
If we go to court, I'll win.

48:16.834 --> 48:18.700
- What do you want?

48:18.700 --> 48:21.767
- Full physical rehab for
Stanton at the prison's expense

48:21.767 --> 48:25.166
and a guarantee that he'll
be assigned light duty tasks.

48:27.100 --> 48:28.600
- Okay.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.233
- And I want those
two Cos fired.

48:30.233 --> 48:32.633
- Beecher--
- Gone, today.

48:32.633 --> 48:34.166
- The union will fight this.

48:34.166 --> 48:37.633
- So, let the union
take the heat.

48:37.633 --> 48:39.900
- All right, they're fired,
I'm busy.

48:42.734 --> 48:44.233
- You're good at this, Tobias.

48:44.233 --> 48:46.333
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

48:51.200 --> 48:54.200
- So, how are you adjusting
to life after death row?

48:54.200 --> 48:55.934
- I'm bored.

48:55.934 --> 48:58.133
Bored of the everyday,

48:58.133 --> 49:01.433
bored with shaving,
brushing my teeth,

49:01.433 --> 49:04.100
taking a shit,
wiping my ass.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.900
- You know what?

49:05.900 --> 49:08.000
I don't think you're bored.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.633
I think you miss Tobias.

49:14.633 --> 49:18.266
- Well, he's turned
into a real firebrand.

49:18.266 --> 49:20.967
No sooner does he get
my sentence overturned

49:20.967 --> 49:24.100
that he's out taking on the case
of some other jamoke.

49:24.100 --> 49:27.667
- He's found a lot of joy
in helping others.

49:27.667 --> 49:30.233
You might want to try
the same thing.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.800
- And how would I do that,
Sister?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.233
I'm not a lawyer.

49:39.233 --> 49:44.066
- Well, who besides Beecher
do you care about?

49:46.900 --> 49:50.066
- My ex-wives, I guess.

49:50.066 --> 49:52.834
- Start there.

49:52.834 --> 49:56.600
- You know something, Sister,
you just gave me a great idea.

49:59.567 --> 50:01.567
Thanks.

50:04.533 --> 50:06.133
Socks.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.800
- Yeah, I know how you are.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.266
You wear them until
they fall off your feet.

50:09.266 --> 50:11.767
Exactly.

50:11.767 --> 50:14.000
- So, what's the latest
from the outside world?

50:16.633 --> 50:18.367
- Kids are great.

50:20.300 --> 50:24.400
Harry...
actually hugged me yesterday.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.500
- Sweet.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.300
I'd like to meet your kids.

50:28.300 --> 50:30.667
- Yeah, right.

50:30.667 --> 50:34.033
- I'm serious.

50:34.033 --> 50:36.066
- Yeah, okay.
Yeah, definitely.

50:36.066 --> 50:40.533
You know, you know,
just not right away, though.

50:40.533 --> 50:42.333
- Been drinking?

50:44.233 --> 50:46.100
- Not a drop.

50:46.100 --> 50:48.200
Went to a cocktail party
the other night

50:48.200 --> 50:50.767
and passed with flying colors.

50:50.767 --> 50:52.834
- Good boy.

50:52.834 --> 50:56.433
And Holly's teacher,
how's she?

50:56.433 --> 50:59.200
- Why do you ask that?

50:59.200 --> 51:00.633
- I don't know, you're the one

51:00.633 --> 51:04.367
who's mentioned her
a couple times.

51:04.367 --> 51:09.033
- You know, actually,
to be honest, Chris--

51:09.033 --> 51:11.900
- Yes, let's be honest.

51:14.633 --> 51:17.133
- Marian and I
have been dating.

51:17.133 --> 51:19.400
- You fuck her yet?

51:19.400 --> 51:20.667
- Chris.

51:20.667 --> 51:22.700
- Be honest.

51:25.834 --> 51:28.066
- Yes.

51:28.066 --> 51:32.600
- Good for you,
you sexy motherfucker.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.934
- You're pissed.

51:34.934 --> 51:37.600
- I'm not.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.567
- Be honest.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.667
- You want a slice of truth?

51:50.967 --> 51:53.700
I killed Franklin Winthrop.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.333
- What?

51:55.333 --> 51:57.100
- No...

51:58.266 --> 52:00.800
- Bitch kills your dad,
bitch gotta die.

52:05.333 --> 52:07.934
- Are you trying to get sent
back to death row?

52:07.934 --> 52:11.100
- I covered my tracks.

52:11.100 --> 52:12.433
- Shit.

52:12.433 --> 52:13.900
- Toby, look,
I'm telling you this--

52:13.900 --> 52:15.734
I'm telling you this...

52:19.266 --> 52:22.133
- I'm not bragging.
I'm not trying to upset you.

52:22.133 --> 52:25.133
I'm telling you this 'cause
I need you to do me a favor.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.533
My ex-wife, Bonnie.

52:32.133 --> 52:35.367
She's been diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

52:37.967 --> 52:41.567
She's dying, Toby,

52:41.567 --> 52:44.066
and the only hope
that she's got is this drug,

52:44.066 --> 52:46.967
it's called oxaliplatin.

52:46.967 --> 52:50.266
And the problem is that
it's illegal in this country,

52:50.266 --> 52:54.934
so, I contacted this guy who,
you know, he just,

52:54.934 --> 52:58.100
he peddles in these kind
of illegal drugs.

52:58.100 --> 53:01.400
All I need you to do
is just meet him,

53:01.400 --> 53:05.433
take the oxaliplatin to Bonnie.

53:05.433 --> 53:07.467
- I can't.

53:07.467 --> 53:09.567
- Why the fuck not?

53:09.567 --> 53:11.367
- I'd be violating my parole.

53:11.367 --> 53:13.934
- Bullshit, I'm asking you to
take a small package

53:13.934 --> 53:17.500
in your pocket
from point A to point B.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.433
- I can't.

53:20.433 --> 53:23.600
- Bonnie is dying.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.433
- Chris...
- I love you.

53:26.433 --> 53:29.333
- Don't...
- I know that you love me.

53:32.533 --> 53:36.633
I'm begging you, please.

53:36.633 --> 53:38.667
Toby, I'm begging you.

53:38.667 --> 53:40.967
- All right.

53:40.967 --> 53:43.967
Give me the address.

53:49.734 --> 53:51.333
I gotta go.

53:51.333 --> 53:55.834
- Toby, you'll see,
this is all for the best.

53:55.834 --> 53:59.166
It's all for the best, Toby.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.667
Yeah, is Detective Weber there?

54:01.667 --> 54:05.300
I got a tip for him,

54:05.300 --> 54:09.533
the sale
of illegal pharmaceuticals.

54:09.533 --> 54:12.633
- A man stands in the cemetery
reading a letter he wrote

54:12.633 --> 54:15.266
finally forgiving
his long-dead father.

54:15.266 --> 54:17.834
The mother of a girl
killed by a drunk driver

54:17.834 --> 54:20.734
is wracked with fantasies
of retaliation.

54:20.734 --> 54:23.734
Your boyfriend begs you
for one more chance,

54:23.734 --> 54:27.533
you say to a mirror
you're done hating yourself.

54:27.533 --> 54:29.633
But you know you're not.

54:29.633 --> 54:31.533
Maybe instead
of forgive and forget

54:31.533 --> 54:33.667
it should be
forgive and remember.

54:33.667 --> 54:35.333
Remember that you might
wake up tomorrow

54:35.333 --> 54:37.600
and have to forgive
all over again,

54:37.600 --> 54:39.867
and again and again,

54:39.867 --> 54:42.800
the way the heart keeps beating
like a drum.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.100
Forgive.

54:44.100 --> 54:45.400
I can't.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.033
You can.

54:47.033 --> 54:50.233
Forgive. Forgive.

54:50.233 --> 54:51.700
I can't.

54:51.700 --> 54:55.000
You can.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Forgive.

55:13.266 --> 55:18.100
- Same old story.

55:18.100 --> 55:20.633
I got fucked in the ass.

55:22.700 --> 55:24.600
- Sit down.

55:30.066 --> 55:32.000
Sit the fuck down.

55:34.467 --> 55:36.633
All right, guys,
welcome to Oz.

55:36.633 --> 55:38.700
Here's the procedure.
