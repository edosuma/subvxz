About me?

- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I thought it would go away...

...but it hasn't. And I feel that it never
will, unless I do something about it.

08:55.610 --> 08:58.033
- So you're leaving?
- Just for the fall...

...to help my cousin in Charm
and to have time to think.

- That's why I came...

during the busy season.

around town, if you'd like?

12:59.779 --> 13:02.160
Well, thank you, but...

13:02.240 --> 13:04.280
...I like to find my own way.

13:05.161 --> 13:06.470
As you wish.

13:13.906 --> 13:16.371
So you're a friend of Lydia-Ann's?

13:16.651 --> 13:19.858
Levi, her husband, is my cousin.

13:21.392 --> 13:23.449

It must have been really hard
for you when he passed.

13:30.204 --> 13:33.898
Yeah, it was... quite a bit harder
for Lydia-Ann and Mary.

13:34.218 --> 13:38.451
Their farm's bigger than most,
so I try to help out as much as I can.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.579

21:23.655 --> 21:25.513
Bye, Sarah.

21:28.015 --> 21:30.594
- I'd like these, please.
- Sure.

21:35.721 --> 21:37.935
(WHINNIES)

21:41.587 --> 21:43.396
Come on!

21:45.618 --> 21:47.986
Yah! Come on!

21:49.098 --> 21:50.379
Come on!

21:55.339 --> 21:58.858
<i>'In vain, I have struggled. It will not do.</i>

21:58.938 --> 22:01.780
<i>My feelings will no longer be repressed.'</i>

22:05.370 --> 22:07.526
(BLEATING)

22:10.001 --> 22:13.809
- EMMA: How did they get out?
- Come on! Come on, kids! Let's go!

22:17.554 --> 22:21.233
- EMMA: This... this one? Come on.
- I don't know why this keeps happening.

22:22.711 --> 22:24.631
Come on!

22:24.711 --> 22:26.788
Yah! Yah!

22:47.053 --> 22:48.643
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

22:49.314 --> 22:50.843
The... goats.

22:51.876 --> 22:53.690
Yeah, the goats.

22:57.817 --> 22:59.818
Sure you're okay?

23:00.348 --> 23:02.831
EMMA:
Yes, it's not my first time wrestling goats.

23:05.202 --> 23:07.967
- Well, thank you for the help.
- EMMA: You're welcome.

23:08.397 --> 23:11.020
You know, Lydia-Ann gave me
a sample of the cheese...

23:11.100 --> 23:14.660
...you made from these little brutes.
It was really good.

23:14.740 --> 23:17.523
Oh. Well... thank you.

23:17.603 --> 23:20.281
I've never tasted anything quite like it.

23:20.361 --> 23:24.783
She said it was because you had
some... secret ingredient.

23:26.031 --> 23:30.543
It's, uh... it's not really a secret,
I just don't tell anybody.

23:31.054 --> 23:34.680
You know, you should enter it into
the Cheese Auction at the Autumn Fest.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.777
Yeah, I, um...
I saw the sign for that in town.

23:38.857 --> 23:42.058
You know, last year
a single block sold for $100.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.253
That's a lot of money.

23:46.233 --> 23:49.242
It was so good, I can't help but wonder
if there's someone back in Shipshewana...

23:49.322 --> 23:51.990
...who's missing your secret ingredient.

23:53.836 --> 23:55.419
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

23:56.965 --> 23:59.081
Why would you think that?

23:59.711 --> 24:01.339
'Cause I know I would.

24:02.706 --> 24:06.691
Well, even if there was someone
waiting for me...

24:06.771 --> 24:09.419
...if that's even what you're asking...

24:09.499 --> 24:12.090
...it wouldn't really matter, because...

24:12.170 --> 24:14.173
...I do as I choose.

24:16.033 --> 24:17.616
So you said.

24:18.853 --> 24:21.496
Well... now you know.

24:24.586 --> 24:26.759
So what is it you choose?

24:26.839 --> 24:28.304
Excuse me?

24:28.384 --> 24:31.861
I mean, you said you do as you choose, so...

24:32.555 --> 24:34.598
...what do you choose?

24:35.626 --> 24:39.641
I mean... when you close your eyes,
what do you see?

24:39.721 --> 24:41.531
Where do you go?

24:42.611 --> 24:44.034
What do you want?

24:49.830 --> 24:51.337
Different.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.669
I want different.

24:56.572 --> 25:00.266
So is that what brings you to Charm,
to your cousin's farm?

25:00.346 --> 25:01.857
Yes.

25:02.555 --> 25:06.085
- But...
- But it's not quite different enough.

25:13.361 --> 25:15.404
I want to see the ocean.

25:18.076 --> 25:20.492
I think it's important to see both worlds...

25:20.872 --> 25:22.757
...the Englisch and the Amish...

25:23.417 --> 25:25.499
...to know what's out there.

25:25.829 --> 25:29.161
And you've done that... seen both?

25:35.217 --> 25:37.020
This is where I belong.

26:02.973 --> 26:04.222
Emma!

26:05.308 --> 26:07.423
- Hey! I thought that was you.
- Hi! Hi!

26:07.503 --> 26:10.260
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, my cousin's farm.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.789
It's just another mile or two down the road.

26:12.869 --> 26:15.392
A mile? Come on, I'll give you a ride.

26:15.472 --> 26:19.546
- Oh, no, I don't want to trouble you.
- Girl, it is no trouble at all.

26:19.626 --> 26:23.031
I mean... if you're allowed.
Are you allowed to get in the car?

26:24.776 --> 26:26.277
Yeah!

26:33.517 --> 26:35.690
(CHUCKLES)

26:35.770 --> 26:39.671
It must be so nice, just to get
in your car any time you feel like it...

26:39.751 --> 26:42.016
...and just go wherever you want.

26:42.096 --> 26:44.138
Yeah, sure. I guess.

26:46.493 --> 26:48.208
Have you ever been to the ocean?

26:48.288 --> 26:51.565
Yeah, my, uh, family has a place.
We go every summer.

26:53.003 --> 26:55.217
I read in a book once that...

26:55.297 --> 26:59.052
...the sound of the waves
and the smell of the saltwater...

26:59.132 --> 27:00.953
...there's nothing like it.

27:01.831 --> 27:04.742
If I could drive, that's where I'd go.

27:04.822 --> 27:08.132
- Well, you can. You should totally go.
- What?

27:08.212 --> 27:10.960
Yeah, you could get a ticket
online to Miami tonight...

27:11.040 --> 27:15.078
...and be drinking, you know,
mai tais tomorrow on the beach.

27:15.158 --> 27:17.998
- Drinking my what?
- Mai tai...

27:20.446 --> 27:23.081
(LAUGHS) Never mind. Never mind.

27:23.161 --> 27:26.676
Oh, my gosh. Me on a plane to Miami!

27:26.756 --> 27:29.110
This is the furthest I've ever been
from Shipshewana.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.714
- Oh! So you're not from Charm?
- No.

27:31.794 --> 27:35.285
No, I'm only here for the fall,
helping my cousin with her produce stand.

27:35.365 --> 27:37.847
Oh. I'm, uh... I'm in town
doing the same thing.

27:37.927 --> 27:41.577
I'm helping out at the library
and my aunt's place.

27:41.657 --> 27:43.839
She's got a bed and breakfast.

27:43.919 --> 27:46.426
We came a very long way to meet.

27:46.506 --> 27:48.924
Maybe we have more in common than we think.

27:50.676 --> 27:52.235
Yeah.

28:02.837 --> 28:05.118
Wow! Look at this place.

28:05.198 --> 28:07.805
Someone has a serious green thumb.

28:07.885 --> 28:10.124
In the smallest space, a fruit tree place.

28:10.204 --> 28:12.394
Attend it well, have fruit to sell.

28:12.474 --> 28:15.423
- What's that?
- An old Amish proverb.

28:15.503 --> 28:18.106
It means 'make the most of what you've got'.

28:19.009 --> 28:22.039
This is Kelly Bennett.
She gave me a ride from town.

28:22.119 --> 28:24.496
And this is my cousin, Lydia-Ann Plank.

28:24.576 --> 28:26.815
- Your aunt is Irene Abbott.
- Yeah.

28:26.895 --> 28:30.286
I deliver my cheese to her inn.
Her cheese, I should say.

28:30.366 --> 28:33.874
Wait, Emma, that's your cheese? It's amazing!

28:33.954 --> 28:36.244
The guests keep asking
where they can find it.

28:36.324 --> 28:39.183
Oh. Well, uh... now you know.

28:39.813 --> 28:42.677
- More customers. Nice to meet you, Kelly.
- You, too.

28:42.757 --> 28:45.417
- Come on, I'll show you around.
- Great.

28:45.837 --> 28:48.219
- KELLY: Cheese girl, huh?
- (LAUGHTER)

28:48.299 --> 28:50.280
- It's amazing!
- Well, thank you.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.644
(BLEATING)

28:55.851 --> 28:57.482
Whoa!

28:57.562 --> 28:59.193
Well...

28:59.273 --> 29:01.654
...they won't be getting out of there again.

29:01.734 --> 29:04.366
- That's what you said last time.
- Hey!

29:04.446 --> 29:08.205
Oh, uh... Noah, this is Kelly Bennett.
Kelly, this is Noah Weaver.

29:08.285 --> 29:11.501
- Hello.
- Hello. Hey.

29:11.581 --> 29:14.171
- Kelly works at the library.
- Oh.

29:14.251 --> 29:18.876
Yeah. Uh... well, this one's blazing
through the romance section like...

29:18.956 --> 29:21.373
...nobody... cares about that.

29:21.603 --> 29:23.650
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:24.130 --> 29:25.604
I've got something for you.

29:25.684 --> 29:28.485
- For me?
- Mm-hm.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.749
Close your eyes.

29:40.829 --> 29:42.544
What?

29:42.624 --> 29:44.482
Go on.

29:46.446 --> 29:47.921
(SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

29:48.001 --> 29:50.446
It's not ridiculous, it's a gift.

29:51.703 --> 29:52.931
Noah.

29:54.515 --> 29:56.621
Emma, come on.

29:56.701 --> 29:58.960
EMMA: Okay, fine.

29:59.271 --> 30:01.088
Turn around.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.827
(WAVES CRASHING)

30:06.907 --> 30:08.730
What is that?

30:09.410 --> 30:11.253
What does it sound like?

30:13.223 --> 30:15.866
Like... a roar.

30:17.171 --> 30:19.045
Like it's alive.

30:19.925 --> 30:21.768
It is alive.

30:23.496 --> 30:26.355
- But it's... not an animal.
- No.

30:27.335 --> 30:29.578
Okay, what... what is it?

30:32.526 --> 30:34.273
It's for you.

30:37.658 --> 30:38.979
It's the ocean.

30:46.461 --> 30:48.328
Thank you.

30:54.973 --> 30:58.000
Wow! So, uh... what's the deal there?

30:58.937 --> 31:01.461
- What do you mean?
- Noah.

31:01.541 --> 31:04.114
Husband? Boyfriend?

31:04.194 --> 31:08.178
No. Uh... Lydia-Ann's husband died last year.

31:08.258 --> 31:11.207
That was Noah's cousin,
and they were very close.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.569
He helps out at the farm whenever he can.

31:13.649 --> 31:16.030
- Oh.
- He's a good man.

31:16.110 --> 31:19.083
- He's probably good at a couple of things.
- Kelly!

31:19.323 --> 31:23.249
- Come on! Like you haven't thought it.
- Oh, my gosh!

31:23.329 --> 31:27.203
No, I... I could never think
of him in that way.

31:27.283 --> 31:29.691
Well, I'm pretty sure
he thinks about you in that way.

31:29.771 --> 31:32.236
Oh, no! Don't be silly.

31:32.316 --> 31:35.892
There's nothing silly about a guy
holding a seashell to your ear.

31:35.972 --> 31:39.385
It's a long story. It's hard to explain.

31:40.911 --> 31:42.917
Yeah, well...

31:42.997 --> 31:45.002
...if I ever met a guy like that...

31:46.218 --> 31:48.316
...maybe my life would be different.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.429
There's a verse in the Bible. It says...

31:51.509 --> 31:55.210
'"...Come out from among them
and ye be separate," sayeth the Lord'.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.897
The way we see it,
the best way to avoid temptation...

31:57.977 --> 32:00.859
...is to isolate ourselves
from the rest of society.

32:00.939 --> 32:05.201
- Temptation?
- Anyone who isn't Amish.

32:05.654 --> 32:09.490
Oh. So they're not too crazy
about you hanging out with me?

32:10.769 --> 32:14.336
My whole life,
I have felt like the Englischer...

32:14.416 --> 32:16.255
...an outsider.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.937
I love my home and my family, but...

32:20.465 --> 32:23.448
...the clothes I wear
and the things that I'm drawn to...

32:23.928 --> 32:26.813
...I just want more color in my life.

32:27.350 --> 32:29.799
That doesn't sound like too much to ask.

32:30.479 --> 32:32.522
It's like asking for the world.

32:33.849 --> 32:36.450
And now... I must decide.

32:37.598 --> 32:39.467
Decide what?

32:42.287 --> 32:45.111
I didn't just come to Charm
to help my cousin.

32:45.884 --> 32:50.007
I came because now is the time when
I have to choose which path to follow.

32:53.327 --> 32:55.962
I've taken a lot of wrong turns in my life.

32:56.682 --> 32:58.488
It's all part of growing up.

32:58.568 --> 33:00.257
No.

33:00.337 --> 33:02.707
The Amish faith isn't like that.

33:03.007 --> 33:04.930
It's strict.

33:05.010 --> 33:06.817
We're given a choice.

33:07.647 --> 33:11.197
I can choose whether to join the Church...

33:11.277 --> 33:14.365
...marry an Amish man and follow
our laws for the rest of my life...

33:14.445 --> 33:19.126
...or I can go out into the world
and try and find my way there.

33:20.782 --> 33:24.508
But if I do that... my path might be set.

33:25.388 --> 33:27.430
It's much harder to come back.

33:35.894 --> 33:37.409
Emma! (SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

33:38.214 --> 33:40.079
I could use some help.

33:55.103 --> 33:57.518
WOMAN:
So how was your first week at the library?

33:57.598 --> 33:59.839
It was great. You know?

33:59.919 --> 34:01.959
Everybody's been so nice.

34:02.339 --> 34:06.128
I, uh... I met this Amish girl
that's very sweet.

34:06.428 --> 34:10.342
- She's seriously into Jane Austen.
- That doesn't sound very Amish.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.675
Yeah, I have a feeling
she's going through something.

34:13.755 --> 34:17.585
It's nice, though... having a
conversation with someone who's...

34:17.666 --> 34:20.742
...not constantly updating their
Instagram every ten seconds.

34:20.822 --> 34:24.100
You see there? You were so worried
about leaving the city...

34:24.179 --> 34:26.016
...missing your friends.

34:27.248 --> 34:30.534
Yeah. This place is definitely growing on me.

34:30.614 --> 34:32.659
That's how life works.

34:33.340 --> 34:36.348
You take a new direction,
you make new friends.

34:36.828 --> 34:38.521
You just have to be open.

34:39.706 --> 34:42.489
It would be a lot easier
if Nick would stop texting me.

34:42.918 --> 34:46.163
- He just won't leave me alone.
- You need to stop worrying about him.

34:46.243 --> 34:49.494
The best thing you ever did was
get that meathead out of your life.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.074
I know it's hard now, honey.

35:01.654 --> 35:04.729
But it'll get better. I promise.

35:05.009 --> 35:06.851
I hope so.

35:08.363 --> 35:11.236
There is something special here for everyone.

35:14.171 --> 35:16.096
I hope it finds you.

35:41.683 --> 35:44.493
The Englischer... how did you meet her?

35:46.331 --> 35:51.109
Oh. She, um... she lost her phone
and I found it, and we started talking.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.021
I can't imagine what you have to talk about.

35:54.201 --> 35:56.083
Do you plan on seeing her again?

35:56.663 --> 35:58.502
I don't know. Uh...

35:58.582 --> 36:01.267
...maybe, yeah.

36:02.921 --> 36:05.938
Look... Kelly is really nice.

36:06.018 --> 36:07.909
You know her aunt.

36:07.989 --> 36:12.517
To sell my cheese.
You must not forget who you are.

36:12.597 --> 36:15.734
- This is how it begins.
- How what begins?

36:16.014 --> 36:18.696
I know more about these things
than you think, Emma...

36:18.776 --> 36:20.657
...mixing the two worlds.

36:20.737 --> 36:24.541
I've seen this before...
with someone else very close to me.

36:25.911 --> 36:27.451
What?

36:28.581 --> 36:30.143
Who?

36:31.043 --> 36:34.201
- Who?
- That is not for me to say.

36:34.281 --> 36:38.432
What I will say... is you must not
make the same mistake.

36:38.512 --> 36:40.194
What are you talking about?

36:41.674 --> 36:45.292
I set out more of your cheese samples
today and they sold out in an hour.

36:45.372 --> 36:47.439
You must make more for tomorrow.

36:49.235 --> 36:52.268
Noah thinks I should enter it
in the Autumn Fest Cheese Auction.

36:52.908 --> 36:55.113
Noah is a wise man.

36:55.393 --> 36:57.236
It may fetch a good price.

36:58.714 --> 37:01.158
Good money for your dad and family back home.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.561
Of course.

have been more wretchedly blind...</i>

(JET ENGINE)

38:07.551 --> 38:09.585
You're sure quiet this morning.

38:10.430 --> 38:14.072
I could sing, if you'd like?
What's your favorite hymn?

38:14.152 --> 38:17.562
- Oh, never mind.
- I'm joking.

38:22.747 --> 38:25.171
You know, when I used
to work in the fields...

38:25.251 --> 38:29.468
...I'd look up at the passing planes all day,
wondering where people were going...

38:29.548 --> 38:34.157
...what I was missing out on, until I finally
went searching for my own answers.

38:34.947 --> 38:37.008
To see new places.

38:37.450 --> 38:39.293
But you came back.

38:42.282 --> 38:46.308
You spend your entire life looking for
something you believe must be out there...

38:46.388 --> 38:49.807
...the one thing that will answer
all of your doubts and fears.

38:51.553 --> 38:55.631
But in the end, the answer I found,
was right here all along.

38:58.499 --> 39:00.377
But that was you.

39:00.857 --> 39:03.072
I don't know yet what's right for me.

39:03.552 --> 39:08.759
I'm only sharing this with you, Emma,
to spare you from all the time I lost...

39:08.840 --> 39:12.668
- ...all the dead ends.
- I don't want to be spared, Noah.

39:12.748 --> 39:15.391
I want to see the world for myself...

39:15.778 --> 39:17.821
...to make my own choices.

39:21.161 --> 39:25.005
Well, I truly hope that you find
what makes you happy.

39:37.642 --> 39:41.083
IRENE: It's not too far. We'll help you
with directions when you get inside.

39:41.163 --> 39:42.694
- All right? So have fun.
- Thank you.

39:42.774 --> 39:45.489
- GIRL: Thank you.
- Bye.

39:45.569 --> 39:50.188
- Morning, Mrs. Abbott. How are you today?
- Just dandy, thank you.

39:50.268 --> 39:54.026
And you must be Emma. Kelly tells me
you two hit it off at the library.

39:54.106 --> 39:55.886
Oh, yeah.

39:55.966 --> 39:58.849
- I feel like I already know you.
- You do?

39:58.929 --> 40:03.280
Well, between everything Kelly's told me,
and that wonderful cheese of yours!

40:03.360 --> 40:05.366
Oh, well... thank you.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.376
- I hope you've brought more.
- Sure did.

40:08.456 --> 40:10.017
Wonderful!

40:10.612 --> 40:12.489
Hey, is, um... is Kelly here?

40:12.569 --> 40:14.638
She's around back.

40:14.818 --> 40:17.061
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

40:19.674 --> 40:22.499
Look, I'm sorry for just
surprising you like this...

40:22.579 --> 40:24.802
...and all the calls and texts,
but I had to talk to you.

40:24.882 --> 40:27.898
- Nick, I want you to leave.
- Please give me a chance.

40:27.978 --> 40:31.054
No. There's no more chances. We're done.

40:31.649 --> 40:33.705
You're the only one I care about.

40:35.253 --> 40:37.060
The only one I love.

40:37.140 --> 40:39.068
Yeah, we both know that's not true.

40:39.148 --> 40:41.499
It's different this time. I'm different.

40:41.579 --> 40:43.527
I trusted you.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.491
You humiliated me. Everyone knows.

40:48.021 --> 40:51.471
I don't want to be with you. I came here
to get away from you and all of that.

40:51.551 --> 40:55.794
You can't be serious? This place
is in the middle of the boonies!

40:56.474 --> 40:58.517
There's nothing here for you.

41:00.672 --> 41:02.679
Actually, there is.

41:03.359 --> 41:05.607
I really like it here.

41:05.687 --> 41:09.112
I like my friends, I like the people
that I'm around, I like how I feel...

41:09.192 --> 41:11.499
...and you're not a part of that.

41:11.579 --> 41:12.659
Come on, Kelly.

41:12.739 --> 41:15.552
- Nick, stop!
- I drove all the way out here.

41:15.632 --> 41:18.316
- The least you can do is...
- Let go of my arm!

41:18.396 --> 41:21.891
- Why have you got to be so difficult, Kelly?
- Kelly! There you are.

41:21.971 --> 41:25.977
- We're kinda in the middle of something.
- I'm Emma. I'm a friend of Kelly's.

41:26.057 --> 41:28.146
Hi. I'm Nick. I don't care.

41:28.226 --> 41:29.857
- Nick, stop!
- We're not done here.

41:29.937 --> 41:31.524
- Nick, you're hurting my arm!
- Stop it!

41:31.604 --> 41:33.254
- Stay out of this!
- Come on, let go of me!

41:33.384 --> 41:35.537
Everything okay here, Emma?

41:36.137 --> 41:37.986
Great, another one.

41:38.366 --> 41:41.128
- Let go of her arm.
- Or what?

42:00.429 --> 42:01.988
Whatever.

42:04.819 --> 42:07.645
Have a nice life
with your new friends, Kelly.

42:12.897 --> 42:14.739
Are you okay?

42:17.160 --> 42:18.669
Yeah.

42:21.283 --> 42:23.402
I'm so sorry, you guys.

42:25.889 --> 42:27.729
I've got an idea.

42:28.209 --> 42:30.017
Come on.

42:49.489 --> 42:50.996
Thanks.

43:17.694 --> 43:20.575
Excuse me? Can you get to Charm on this road?

43:20.655 --> 43:22.849
Yeah. Just go two miles straight ahead.

43:22.929 --> 43:26.372
Thanks. Uh... By the way...

43:26.452 --> 43:29.187
...I kind of ate all your cheese samples.

43:29.267 --> 43:31.360
That's okay.

43:34.366 --> 43:36.169
(CLEARS THROAT)

43:36.619 --> 43:39.310
This isn't gonna be in the auction
at the festival tomorrow, is it?

43:39.390 --> 43:42.812
Yeah. Yes. Yes, it will be.

43:42.892 --> 43:44.903
Did you make it?

43:45.356 --> 43:47.243
I did.

43:47.323 --> 43:50.990
Well, it's exquisite... just like its maker.

43:53.217 --> 43:55.551
- You shouldn't say such things.
- No?

43:55.631 --> 43:58.654
- No.
- Even if it's true?

43:58.734 --> 44:01.550
- You don't even know me.
- What's your name?

44:01.630 --> 44:04.054
- Emma Miller.
- Emma Miller.

44:04.734 --> 44:06.776
Andy Nevins.

44:08.563 --> 44:12.412
I'm the editor for Wine, Cheese and Dining,
one of the biggest food blogs on the Internet.

44:14.587 --> 44:17.546
Well, I can't say I spend
a lot of time on a computer, so...

44:17.626 --> 44:20.215
Right. Sorry.

44:20.295 --> 44:23.408
Well, we've never done a story
on the Amish and their cheese before.

44:23.488 --> 44:26.570
Would you possibly have time
for an interview?

44:27.514 --> 44:29.080
- You want to interview me?
- Yeah.

44:29.160 --> 44:33.563
We could meet at the pavilion before
the auction tomorrow. Say, two o'clock?

44:35.217 --> 44:38.057
- I don't know. I...
- Emma, I have traveled...

44:38.137 --> 44:42.214
...all over the world, eaten at the best
restaurants, and I am telling you...

44:42.294 --> 44:45.346
...it would be a crime
to keep your cheese a secret.

44:46.482 --> 44:48.255
You're teasing.

44:48.335 --> 44:50.411
Do you wanna bet?

44:54.118 --> 44:55.903
You're busy. Uh...

44:56.563 --> 44:59.272
This is my number. Call me.
I'm staying in town. We can...

45:00.402 --> 45:02.799
- You don't have a phone, do you?
- No.

45:02.879 --> 45:06.350
Okay, forget that. Let's just meet up
tomorrow before the auction.

45:08.705 --> 45:12.524
- Okay.
- Okay. It's a date.

45:28.119 --> 45:30.134
Is that your batch for the auction?

45:30.814 --> 45:34.299
Yes, I'm... trying not to think about it.

45:41.787 --> 45:45.123
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

45:45.203 --> 45:47.068
When you met Levi...

45:47.795 --> 45:50.729
...did you know right away
that he was the one?

45:52.302 --> 45:54.183
What I knew...

45:54.263 --> 45:57.249
...was that he was the first person
I wanted to go to to tell things.

45:57.329 --> 46:00.718
And that he... always was interested
in what I had to say.

46:01.982 --> 46:04.025
That he was my best friend.

46:07.782 --> 46:10.364
I can't even imagine how hard it is...

46:10.444 --> 46:12.651
...to find love and then lose it.

46:13.031 --> 46:15.873
Hard, yes.

46:16.477 --> 46:19.912
But I was blessed to have Levi
for as long as I did.

46:23.980 --> 46:26.332
Is this about the time you've been
spending with the Englischer?

46:26.412 --> 46:29.468
No. No, it's not her.

46:30.271 --> 46:32.168
It's me.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.124
I just...

46:34.652 --> 46:37.951
...I need to figure out why I feel
the way that I do.

46:38.031 --> 46:40.038
Well, then, we'll talk.

46:40.118 --> 46:41.908
Then we'll pray.

46:42.288 --> 46:46.106
And with God's help, you'll find your answer.

46:49.063 --> 46:51.278
But what if God's answer...

46:51.358 --> 46:54.618
...takes me away from everything that I know?

46:55.431 --> 46:57.574
Then that is his will, too.

easily be the next big thing.

- And you're blushing.

No! No! No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

49:48.907 --> 49:51.509
- Yeah.
- No, but it...

49:51.589 --> 49:54.137
- ...it's just cheese.
- Emma, it's more than that.

49:54.217 --> 49:56.024

will be lining up to place an order.

- Manhattan?
- I'm assuming you've never been there.

- No.
- Okay. The energy... it's magical...

50:12.810 --> 50:16.836

but you'd get used to that.

Um, I have a pound of chevre,
which is goat cheese.

Neither do you.

58:31.212 --> 58:33.424
I know more than you think.

58:35.785 --> 58:37.844

58:38.639 --> 58:41.646
What others say? What others know?

58:41.726 --> 58:45.570
I've seen these people...
out there in the world. They're...

That's a lot of men in your life.

59:25.052 --> 59:27.225
How did you know when you were in love?

59:27.305 --> 59:31.322
It was... such a long time ago.

59:31.402 --> 59:35.637
To tell you the truth, Nick and I spent
most of our time together out of love.

59:35.717 --> 59:38.933
- I was just too busy to notice.
- Busy?

59:39.013 --> 59:43.051
Trying to keep everyone happy,
pretending like everything was perfect.

59:46.290 --> 59:49.669
What happened between you two,
if you don't mind me asking?

59:53.658 --> 59:57.094
Well, my school had a study-abroad program...

59:57.788 --> 01:00:00.684
...so I spent last summer in London,
traveled all around Europe...

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.793
...until I came home and started hearing...

01:00:05.408 --> 01:00:09.113
...stories from a lot of people about Nick.

01:00:09.196 --> 01:00:11.039
What kind of stories?

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:15.786
That he was cheating on me...

01:00:16.297 --> 01:00:18.140
...while I was away.

01:00:19.836 --> 01:00:21.879
It wasn't the first time, either.

01:00:22.682 --> 01:00:25.717
That's why I ended up
calling off the engagement.

01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:31.041
When I told him
I wasn't changing my mind, he, um...

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.890
...he got so angry.

01:00:44.703 --> 01:00:46.386
Yeah.

01:00:49.719 --> 01:00:51.782
That's when I knew I had to get away.

01:00:52.598 --> 01:00:56.372
Away from him, away from everything
that reminded me of him.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:59.722
Somewhere... somewhere I could start over.

01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:02.824
So you came to Charm.

01:01:03.504 --> 01:01:07.196
Yeah, between working for my aunt,
my job at the library...

01:01:07.276 --> 01:01:11.688
...I get by, and don't have time to think
about where I'm going and what I'm doing.

01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:13.904
My next chapter.

01:01:18.525 --> 01:01:20.935
I will pray for you to find happiness.

01:01:21.821 --> 01:01:25.454
I don't know if that will work for me.
It's been so long.

01:01:25.534 --> 01:01:28.027

They're... really pretty.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.284
Well, it was love at first sight.

01:01:58.555 --> 01:02:02.024
I saw in a magazine once these pink,
high-heeled sandals...

01:02:02.104 --> 01:02:04.258
...with little diamonds all over the top.

01:02:04.338 --> 01:02:06.303
- Flashy!
- (LAUGHS) Yeah!

had this cute little ring on her pinkie toe.

Amish Vogue, right?

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:18.763

- Oh, I got caught.

01:02:19.383 --> 01:02:23.272

Well, I won't tell.

They said you never had it as a child.

It gets more dangerous
as you grow older, Emma.

- It's delicious.
- See what you've been missing?

01:09:33.589 --> 01:09:36.810
There is so much in this world
that I don't know about.

There's just... there's so many things
that I want to see and that I want to do.

01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:23.293
So the guy at the auction said there was
a secret ingredient in your cheese.

01:10:23.373 --> 01:10:25.388
You care to let us in on it?

01:10:25.868 --> 01:10:28.192
Well, I just...

01:10:28.272 --> 01:10:30.270
...add a little honey.

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.298
- Just honey?
- Mm-hm.

01:10:32.378 --> 01:10:34.826
Well, my neighbor
in Shipshewana had a hive...

01:10:34.906 --> 01:10:38.314
...and so normally I would get it there,
but here I just go to the market.

01:10:38.394 --> 01:10:43.183
Okay. So the honey's organic, locally grown.

01:10:43.268 --> 01:10:45.908
Like an old Amish family recipe
that's been passed down?

01:10:45.988 --> 01:10:48.704
(LAUGHS) No. Actually,
the first time it was an accident.

01:10:48.784 --> 01:10:52.292
- I knocked over the jar of honey...
- But now? I mean, it's a family recipe now.

01:10:52.372 --> 01:10:55.438
You're probably gonna pass it down, so...

01:10:55.518 --> 01:11:00.679
Um... well, yes, but that kind of makes it
sound like my mom or my grandmother.

01:11:00.859 --> 01:11:03.883
Emma, what we're doing here
is we're creating a hook...

01:11:03.963 --> 01:11:07.564
...something that's gonna draw the reader in.
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:11:08.244 --> 01:11:10.164
But it's not true.

01:11:10.246 --> 01:11:12.689
You want people to read the story?

01:11:14.211 --> 01:11:15.757
Yes.

01:11:15.837 --> 01:11:18.736
So sometimes you've got to fudge
a little on the details.

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:23.610
I mean, who's it really gonna hurt?
The point is, you make a really great cheese.

01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:26.958
I should know... I paid enough for it.

01:11:33.462 --> 01:11:34.981
Okay.

You want to have dinner with me?

Yeah. We could do it at the inn
where you're staying, if it's easier?

What is it? What... what's wrong?

Of course! I... Jacob is a good man...

...and he will be a good husband to Abby.

01:13:29.384 --> 01:13:32.741
So, uh... no regrets?

I have love for Jacob
like you would a brother.

have if they plan to marry.

how lucky I was to have him in my life.

...my whole life...

...I have tried to follow the rules
and to behave the way that I should.

01:22:37.444 --> 01:22:38.825
Oh, my gosh!

01:22:42.918 --> 01:22:45.361
It is so beautiful.

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:50.193
You're the most beautiful.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:22:59.186
BOTH: Oh, look at that!

01:22:59.466 --> 01:23:01.275
EMMA: I like that one.

01:23:02.503 --> 01:23:04.512
KELLY: <i>She just left.</i>

01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:06.724
With Andy?

01:23:07.619 --> 01:23:10.062
But I'm sure they'll be right back.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.609
Yeah.

01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:16.401
Thanks, Kelly.

01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:18.547
I'll tell her you stopped by.

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.793
Please don't.

01:23:29.794 --> 01:23:31.632
You love it.

01:23:32.769 --> 01:23:34.358
Yeah.

01:23:34.438 --> 01:23:35.906
I love it.

01:23:36.566 --> 01:23:38.609
(LAUGHTER)

01:23:51.879 --> 01:23:55.106
Hey... it's okay, it's just a kiss.

01:23:55.893 --> 01:23:57.710
Don't be nervous.

01:24:01.725 --> 01:24:05.902
Look at me. You said you wanted
to try new things, right?

01:24:05.982 --> 01:24:08.589
- Please stop.
- It's just a kiss.

01:24:09.152 --> 01:24:10.835
Andy...

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:14.727
Andy, please don't. Andy, please. Stop!

01:24:18.357 --> 01:24:21.741
What's your problem, Emma? You show up
dressed like that and you're telling me...

01:24:21.821 --> 01:24:24.801
- ...this isn't what you wanted?
- No, never!

01:24:24.991 --> 01:24:27.706
Really? Well, I got news for you.

01:24:27.786 --> 01:24:30.210
You say you want to see the world?

01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:33.962
Take a good look,
because this is what people do.

01:24:35.797 --> 01:24:37.420
This is not my world.

01:25:08.944 --> 01:25:12.242
Hey. Are you all right? You changed.

01:25:12.602 --> 01:25:14.396
What happened?

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:16.052
Yes.

01:25:16.828 --> 01:25:18.671
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:22.140
Yes, I do, but...

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.822
...right now... I just need to go.

01:25:25.224 --> 01:25:27.263
I'll take you to Lydia's.

01:25:27.343 --> 01:25:30.770
Thank you, but... I need to go home.

01:26:06.714 --> 01:26:08.937
I see you've made your decision.

01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:13.788
I have.

01:26:15.602 --> 01:26:16.704
And?

01:26:19.744 --> 01:26:23.190
Everyone said that they had faith
in me to make the right choices.

01:26:25.173 --> 01:26:27.329
But what I really needed...

01:26:27.409 --> 01:26:29.494
...was faith in myself.

01:26:30.497 --> 01:26:33.362
Faith that I would know
the answers when they came.

01:26:35.896 --> 01:26:37.943
That's all you have.

01:26:42.706 --> 01:26:44.127
Sometimes...

01:26:45.334 --> 01:26:47.373
...God willing...

01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:49.416
...we find our answers in another.

01:26:54.363 --> 01:26:58.958
Someone who is the first person
that we want to go to to tell things.

01:27:02.507 --> 01:27:05.926
Someone who is always interested
in what we have to say.

01:27:11.252 --> 01:27:13.303
Someone who is our best friend.

01:27:19.243 --> 01:27:20.926
Someone who loves you.

01:27:22.928 --> 01:27:24.904
This is where I belong.

01:28:24.821 --> 01:28:26.763
(RATTLING)

01:28:31.579 --> 01:28:32.626
(CHUCKLES)

01:28:32.706 --> 01:28:34.555
She's okay. (SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

01:28:35.035 --> 01:28:38.704
- Hi! Good morning!
- Hey! Good morning!

01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:45.052
- How is my little baby girl doing?
- Oh, she's so good. Just woke up.

01:28:45.132 --> 01:28:47.004
- Aw!
- Always smiling.

01:28:47.084 --> 01:28:50.423
- KELLY: Oh, my God. She's gorgeous.
- How are things at the inn?

01:28:50.503 --> 01:28:54.365
Great. They're great. Except,
we keep running out of Emma Chevre.

01:28:54.445 --> 01:28:57.755
We're having orders from New York,
Canada. I mean, it's just...

01:28:57.835 --> 01:29:01.752
- ...it's the best. It's the best cheese.
- Not bad for two girls from the boonies.

01:29:01.832 --> 01:29:05.017
Not bad at all. Not bad at all. That's right.

01:29:05.097 --> 01:29:07.171
- That's right. That's right.
- (JET ENGINE)

01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:19.424
- She's so sweet. She looks like Noah.
- EMMA: Yeah.

01:29:19.504 --> 01:29:21.986
- Where is he, by the way?
- Uh...

01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:24.014
(BLEATING)

01:29:24.094 --> 01:29:25.744
Morning!
