00:24.566 --> 00:26.693
**

00:26.735 --> 00:28.570
- Oh, no!

00:38.246 --> 00:40.749
Ow, ow! Hot!

00:40.790 --> 00:43.209
- That was quite
a crash, son.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.255
Oh, look at
that goose egg.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.051
Where are your parents,
sweetie?

00:51.092 --> 00:54.137
- I don't know.
- How old are you?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.181
10, 11?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.058
- I-I don't know.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.226
- The crash must
have rung your bell.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.853
Well, let's start simple.
You got a name?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.563
- I don't know!

01:03.605 --> 01:04.606
I don't know!
- [Wandering woman] Shh, shh!

01:04.647 --> 01:06.399
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Let me help you.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.443
I can help
get you home safe.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.320
[groaning]

01:11.571 --> 01:12.697
- Wait!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.449
- Fat chance, kid!
Watkin storm's a comin'.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.411
- Hey, that's my car!

01:23.667 --> 01:25.502

01:29.631 --> 01:32.092

[thunder crackling]

**

01:44.938 --> 01:46.398
Who is this asshole?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.240
- Give me those glasses.
The sun's bullying me.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.866
- I can't, I'm dyin'.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.119
Say nice things
at my funeral.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.830
Take the time to speak
highly of my good deeds.

02:01.871 --> 02:05.125
- Man, dudes cannot handle
hangovers for shit.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.085
- No hangovers in
New San Francisco,

02:07.127 --> 02:08.545
I'll tell you that.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.297
Oh, I had this sexy
pork tenderloin last time.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.342
[smacking lips]
God, I can't wait.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.970
- I can't wait for a dog.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.430
- Nah, too gamey.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.682
- What?! No!
Not to eat.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.100
- Oh.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.935
- I always wanted a pet.

02:23.977 --> 02:28.398
You know, like a wolfdog
with three legs named Patrick.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.275
- I'm not taking
care of a dog.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.609
- Nobody asked you to!

02:31.651 --> 02:33.028
- Well, we're living
together. I mean...

02:33.069 --> 02:34.571
- What?!
Are we living together?

02:34.612 --> 02:35.822
- What?! No!

02:35.864 --> 02:38.158
What? No!
Why? No!

02:38.199 --> 02:40.577
I mean, like living together
in the same city.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.995
- Oh.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.079
- You call me to walk your dog
when you're not home,

02:43.121 --> 02:44.831
at your home,
and I'm home at my home.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.335
See, two separate homes.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.045
So, that makes two homes.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.088
- Hmm.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.840
- Unless you want
to live together.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.592
- Do you?
- I don't know.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.344
Do you?

02:57.385 --> 02:58.720
- You seem like
a shitty roommate.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.347
I mean, you can't even share
your fuckin' sunglasses.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.892
- Yeah, I can share
my shitty popcorn.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.854
- Wow, your aim
is so good.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.273
Oh, shit!
[gasps]

03:10.315 --> 03:12.484
Is this the infamous photo?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.735
- Hey!
- Dude, what the hell happened?

03:13.777 --> 03:14.694
You were so cute.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.821
- Take it easy with that.
- Oh!

03:16.863 --> 03:19.616
This is the only photo
you have of your past life

03:19.657 --> 03:20.825
and you keep it
in your visor.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.869
I think I can handle
holding it for one...

03:22.911 --> 03:24.371
Shit!

03:24.412 --> 03:26.206
- I fuckin' told you
to be careful.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.999
Stupid!

03:31.795 --> 03:33.213
Hey, I said stay back
with Evelyn

03:33.254 --> 03:34.422
and watch the package.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.133
- I can do two things.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.635
[sighs]

03:38.677 --> 03:40.512
How old were you
in that photo anyway?

03:40.553 --> 03:42.722
- How does anyone keep
track of that shit?

03:42.764 --> 03:45.767
- I mean, birthdays,
moon phases,

03:45.809 --> 03:47.560
cut your dick open
and count the rings.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.104
- Can we just focus on
finding the picture?

03:49.145 --> 03:50.355
We're running out
of day light.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.732
- [Quiet] Oh, found it!

03:55.402 --> 03:57.070
Ah-ah, what do you say?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.406
- Don't drop it again.
- Hmm.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.865
[engine starting]

04:00.907 --> 04:03.410
- Come on, get in the car!

04:03.451 --> 04:05.036
- No, no, no, no!

04:05.078 --> 04:06.746
[gun firing]

04:06.788 --> 04:09.082
[grunting]

04:09.124 --> 04:11.418
[gun firing]
Ugh!

04:11.459 --> 04:15.296
[retching]
- [Quiet] Fucking holy men!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.590
- [John Doe]
Goddamn [indistinct].

04:17.632 --> 04:21.720
[grunting]

04:21.761 --> 04:23.638
- I can't believe some fucking
holy men stole our--

04:23.680 --> 04:26.099
- What the fuck
did you do?

04:26.141 --> 04:28.309
- John.
- Fuck.

04:31.771 --> 04:45.869
**

04:45.910 --> 04:47.287
- Okay, we've been
walking for an hour

04:47.328 --> 04:50.165
and you haven't said shit.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.375
I don't know what else
to say, John.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.961
I fucked up.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.714
If you want to focus on
being mad, then... go ahead.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.884
I guess we'll just
walk until we die.

05:00.925 --> 05:05.305
**

05:05.347 --> 05:07.891
- This isn't the first time
I lost Evelyn.

05:07.932 --> 05:11.269
Vultures took her one time,
Necros another time.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.479
- Oh, shit!

05:12.520 --> 05:14.147
- One time I just forgot
where I parked her.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.940
- Okay, well, that's stupid.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.401
- Yeah, it's stupid,
but every time I've lost her,

05:18.443 --> 05:20.403
she's come back to me.

05:20.445 --> 05:24.282
- Then let me help you
find her this time.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.409
Please.

05:27.869 --> 05:28.995
- Fine.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.081
[church bell ringing]

05:35.627 --> 05:37.420
- [Quiet] Wait, wait!
Where you going?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.172
- I'm following the bells.
That's where Evelyn is.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.216
- We can't just waltz into
a holy man murder-palooza.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.426
You saw what those fuckers did
to the convoy's milkman.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.054
- Evelyn is so close.
We need to go get her back.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.056
And I can't
do it by myself.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.558
So, what do
you say, partner?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.437
- Okay.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.147
Let's go get your car.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.733
- Great.
- What?

05:58.775 --> 05:59.943
- We've gotta go get
those masks off

05:59.984 --> 06:02.779
those holy men we killed
so we can blend in.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.115
- Isn't that like
an hour that way?

06:07.409 --> 06:10.203
I'm just gonna wait here.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.497
Did you hear me?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.582
He didn't hear me.

06:21.089 --> 06:21.548
- Please, please.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.512
Ugh!

Stomach, shut up!

Excuse me, sir.

Too bad.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.712
- Sounds like this is it.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.302
- I don't love
how moist this mask is.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.138
- At least your guy
didn't have a beard.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.473
I'm gonna be pullin' face pubes
out of my mouth all night.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.683
- Ick!

08:36.725 --> 08:38.852
- Also, we gotta work
on your dude voice.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.979
- Dude voice?
- Yeah.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.982
Holy men.
You gotta fit in.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.442
Go deep,
let me hear it.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.651
- Um...

08:46.693 --> 08:48.945
I love killing
and guns, I do.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.658
- Just try not to talk.

I'm gonna kill you.

- Well, I'm gonna kill you.
Let's do it.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.881
- Cool party, huh?

09:09.299 --> 09:13.178
- Dinner for the sinner!
[chuckling]

09:13.219 --> 09:14.804
- Holy shit!

09:14.846 --> 09:16.431
How are these guys
not dead already?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.308
- Stop staring.
Just blend in.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.477
- My man!

09:20.518 --> 09:22.896
- I want that!
- Too fuckin' bad!

09:22.937 --> 09:26.524
- From one brother to another,
I propose a clash.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.443
[chuckles]
- Let it begin!

09:28.485 --> 09:31.112

having a good time.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
- Holy shit!

09:36.409 --> 09:37.869
Maybe he deserved it.

- I didn't.

- Cool. I hate this place.

So, just blend in
with these freaks

09:56.304 --> 09:57.555

Oh, shit!
Uh, uh...

10:01.726 --> 10:03.311
Oh, bullocks.

- Who told you to speak?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.399
- Agh!

- Here.

It's chug-a-lug time!

a Jack and coke.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.061

it crunchy?

10:45.103 --> 10:47.981

10:48.023 --> 10:49.441
- It's Preacher.
- It's Preacher.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.577
- [Holy Man] Absolve my sins!

11:00.618 --> 11:01.911
- I think the coke
is kicking in.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.371
- I can't feel my throat.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.206
- I'm gonna shit myself.

Which one of you
blessed fucks

- [Preacher] Okay.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.150
- Enjoy.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.319
- Gods and Goddesses,

11:34.361 --> 11:37.864
it is my honor
to be with you again

11:37.906 --> 11:42.035
here in Colorado
for our annual pilgrimage,

11:42.077 --> 11:44.913
The Rocky Mountain
Fuck Fest!

11:44.954 --> 11:47.499
[laughing, cheering]

11:47.540 --> 11:52.837
Now, while we are indulging
in the seven deadly delights,

11:52.879 --> 11:55.048
let us recall
our past

11:55.090 --> 11:57.967
and celebrate
our futures!

11:58.009 --> 12:01.763
Me? I was a man of God.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.349
Shit, I was even celibate.

God was nowhere
to be found.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.280
And I thought, huh!
This fucker's forsaken us.

12:19.322 --> 12:23.326
Right? But then
I realized, no!

12:25.328 --> 12:27.163

Okay, guys, you gotta get
more creative than just drugs.

so keep your distance.

Now the whole vibe

25:43.209 --> 25:56.306
**

25:56.348 --> 25:59.642
* You used to
captivate me *

25:59.684 --> 26:03.480
* By your
resonating light *

26:03.521 --> 26:09.903
* Now I'm bound by the life
you left behind *

26:09.944 --> 26:13.156
* Your face it holds *

26:13.198 --> 26:16.493
* My once plans
and dreams *

26:16.534 --> 26:19.996
* Your voice
it chased away *

26:20.038 --> 26:23.750
* All the sanity
in me *

26:23.792 --> 26:27.128
* These wounds
won't seem to heal *

26:27.170 --> 26:30.382
* This pain
is just too real *

26:30.423 --> 26:35.970
* There's just too much
that time cannot erase *

26:36.012 --> 26:42.185
* When your cried I'd wipe away
all of your tears *

26:42.227 --> 26:43.645
* When you'd scream *

26:43.687 --> 26:48.400
* I'd fight away
all of your fears *

26:48.441 --> 26:55.198
* You still have *

26:55.240 --> 27:00.870
* All of me *

27:00.912 --> 27:07.460
* Ah me *

27:07.502 --> 27:17.429
* Ah me ah *

27:17.470 --> 27:29.524
**
