WEBVTT

00:02.378 --> 00:05.254
Hey, nigga, is there gonna be
some pussy in this motherfucker?

00:05.422 --> 00:09.258
There's gonna be a gang of ho's up in this
motherfucker. I threw the shit myself.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.386
Can y'all brothers spare some change?

00:11.553 --> 00:13.763
Hey, yo, man,
get the fuck out of my face, fool!

00:13.931 --> 00:15.640
Fuck what he say. Remember that bitch?

00:15.808 --> 00:19.560
Hell, yeah, nigga. Shit, man.
That bitch was crying like a motherfucker.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.688
- I heard that bitch was a toss up.
- Keisha?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.815
She gonna be
at the motherfucking party, niggas.

00:23.982 --> 00:27.318
Oh, oh. Fade it.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.945
Hey, that bitch got a body.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.571
Yeah, she got a body, man.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.408
- Shit, boy. I'm gonna have to get with her.
- I heard that.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.369
Let's see what's up in this motherfucker.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.579
You ain't got to be creeping.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.917
I don't know why you're trying to act
like you're cleaning up.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.380
Damn. Always think
we gonna steal something.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.424
What you want, Dog?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.884
Go ahead and give me that Old E. Yeah.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.970
I'm gonna fuck with some of this Ides.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.304
Oh, no. Wait.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.099
Man, I'm from the old school, brother.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.185
- Shit.
- You not drink beer in store.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.770
Hey, man, I'm gonna pay you.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.650
Hey, look, bitch. Stop following me
around this motherfucker.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.152
You getting on my nerves.

01:09.486 --> 01:10.778
Hurry up and buy.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.573
Shut the fuck up, man.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.661
Just pay and leave.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.831
I'm gonna pay you. Why don't
you calm your motherfucking nerves?

01:21.999 --> 01:23.541
Hurry up and go.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.169
- Why don't you go ahead and get it?
- Shit.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.422
I got your back.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.760
Shit.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.722
- Why don't you get my change?
- Thank you.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.643
Hey, why don't you give my homeboy
his change?

01:43.979 --> 01:46.189
I don't want any trouble. Just get out.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.024
I can't stand y'all, motherfucker.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.359
I feel sorry for your mother.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.155
What you say about my mama?

01:54.323 --> 01:55.615
You feel sorry for who?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.242
I don't want any trouble. Just get out!

01:58.410 --> 02:01.037
- What the fuck did you say?
- I don't want any trouble.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.288
You talking shit?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.041
Every time I come in this motherfucker,
you got something to say.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.294
Yeah, yeah.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.047
Where the motherfucking videotape?

02:11.215 --> 02:13.132
Give me the motherfucking video. Stop.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.384
Give me the motherfucking videotape
right now.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.471
Hey, nigga. Clean the cash register.
Come on. You shut up. You shu... Hey.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.557
Shut the fuck up with your noise.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.518
- Oh, shit!
- You better shut the fuck...

02:23.685 --> 02:24.727
I ain't playing.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.396
- Where's the tape at?
- What the fuck did you do, man?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.982
Go get this motherfucker
right now. I said eject it.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.109
If you don't eject it
I'm gonna smoke your ass.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.402
Hey, bitch, do it right now.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.571
Bitch, I told your stupid ass
to shut the fuck up!

02:37.032 --> 02:38.157
Nigga, hurry up!

02:38.325 --> 02:39.367
Hell, yeah.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.369
Come on, man. Let's raise up, man. Damn!

02:41.745 --> 02:43.996
- Wha... I can't believe this.
- Move.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.499
I thought I told you
to open the damn register

02:46.959 --> 02:49.377
Thought you were down.
How do you open this shit?

02:51.213 --> 02:54.257
What the fu...?
Six motherfucking dollars, nigga?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.593
Y'all got money
in this motherfucker somewhere.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.762
This don't make sense.
Let's just go, man.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.765
- Give me your change. Goddamn ready teller.
- Dog!

03:03.100 --> 03:04.475
I'm gonna keep your shit too.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.854
- Fuck!
- Jackpot. Hell, yeah.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.940
Get this motherfucker, here. Shit.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.192
Ain't gonna talk shit, are you?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.778
Where all the money at, man? Fuck that.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.447
- Fuck, let's go!
- Goddamn.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.033
- Went into the store just to get a beer.
- Wait up.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.161
Came out an accessory to murder
and armed robbery.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.664
It was funny like that
in the 'hood sometimes.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.625
But you never knew
what was gonna happen or when.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.587
After that,
I knew it was gonna be a long summer.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.551
One thousand persons
rioted in the Watts district last night.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.220
They attacked police with rocks,
bricks and bottles...

03:41.388 --> 03:42.638
before some 100...

03:42.806 --> 03:45.641
officers sealed off the four-block area...

03:45.809 --> 03:48.978
in the vicinity of 116th Street
and Avalon Boulevard.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.564
Four persons were arrested
and a number of others...

03:51.732 --> 03:54.567
including one policeman
were injured in the melee.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.321
The riot was touched off
when three drunk drivers...

04:06.163 --> 04:09.999
This is Donald Miller, Mobile Unit 3.
We're right in the center of this...

04:10.167 --> 04:12.084
Burn, baby, burn

04:12.252 --> 04:14.503
Burn, baby, burn

04:14.671 --> 04:17.839
to battle rioters in the burning
and looted Negro area.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.216
- Come on!
- What the fuck are you doing?

04:20.385 --> 04:22.678
The commander
of the California National Guard...

04:22.846 --> 04:25.181
said his troops sent
into the riot area...

04:25.349 --> 04:29.310
would use whatever force
is necessary to do the job.

04:29.478 --> 04:33.147
Residents
of this primarily colored area.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.441
The rattle of gunfire
was heard increasingly...

04:35.609 --> 04:38.027
in the Negro section
during the smoggy evening...

04:38.195 --> 04:41.989
as the police confronted
roving bands of rampaging Negroes.

04:42.157 --> 04:46.911
One guard unit opened machine-gun
fire for 10 minutes on a gang of negros...

04:47.079 --> 04:49.038
who then fled down the street.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.250
William H. Parker,
Los Angeles Police Chief...

04:53.418 --> 04:55.836
angrily blamed
last night's violence...

04:56.004 --> 04:58.881
When the riots stopped,
the drugs started.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.303
My father sold dope...

05:04.471 --> 05:07.556
and my mother was a heroin addict.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.227
Moms and Pops were real popular
in the neighborhood.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.356
They would always be having parties for
friends of theirs who just got out of jail...

05:15.524 --> 05:17.733
or who was on their way to jail.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.611
They only got married
because I was born.

05:20.821 --> 05:25.533
My pop sometimes worked as an electrician
or a cab driver or a plumber...

05:25.701 --> 05:28.661
but his main job was selling drugs.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.415
Sometimes, Mom would use them all up
before he could even sell them.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.875
Then he'd have to beat her up.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.836
Growing up with parents like that...

05:37.004 --> 05:40.506
I heard a lot, and I saw a lot.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.968
I caught on to the
criminal life real quick.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.095
Instead of keeping me out of trouble...

05:46.263 --> 05:48.431
they turned me on to it.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.100
That motherfucker's got
some love up there too.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.019
I think there were some tears of joy.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.273
You give me the pig, I get you...
And he said...

05:57.441 --> 06:00.276
What's up, Pernell? Clyde?

06:00.569 --> 06:02.570
KayDee Caine. What you doing out here?

06:02.904 --> 06:04.238
Stop calling me that.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.283
Shut up, little old nigga.
This party here for grown folks.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.244
- Y'all ain't grown.
- We older than your little ass.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.454
Tat know you out here?

06:11.621 --> 06:12.997
Nope. I snuck out.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.708
You a bad fucker. Come here.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.210
Gonna get us in trouble. What you doing?

06:18.628 --> 06:21.088
Now, go on and give the nigga a drink.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.637
What the fuck is that?

06:34.436 --> 06:36.103
What the hell you doing, boy?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.731
You mess around and shoot all of us.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.941
Let me see it.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.360
Let me show you how to hold it.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.112
Caine.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.032
Caine.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.658
What you doing out that room?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.494
I'm just out here playing, Mama.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.997
You better get your little ass in that room
before your daddy catch you.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.708
You hear me talking to you? Now.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.293
What the hell?

06:59.461 --> 07:02.463
Pernell looked out for me when things
got rough. He taught me.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.632
He showed me what being a hustler
was all about.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.511
- Hi-ya! Twenty-one.
- Motherfucker!

07:08.678 --> 07:10.346
Hey.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.264
Hey, are you all done yet?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.268
Yeah.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.730
Hold up, bitch. Let us clean off the table.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.857
Shit, I've been waiting all day.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.110
- You got change for a 5?
- No. You got it.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.862
- You got change for a 5?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.697
Cheating me out of my goddamn money.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.243
Shit.
Gonna bust that head wide open, man.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.830
Yeah. Yeah, I got something for you.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.797
Say, Tat.
Your lady here looks a little tired.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.176
Tat keeping her up at night trying
to knock the lining out that motherfucker.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.303
Y'all are some damn motherfuckers, man.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.430
- Fuck that shit.
- Come on, deal the cards.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.183
Look, man. Tonight you got
the junk about two weeks.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.477
Don't you think it's time
you gave me my money?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.647
Told you
I ain't have your money yet, man.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.483
Fuck you mean,
you ain't got my money yet?

08:04.651 --> 08:08.237
Everybody know you hid the money
from that robbery before you went upstate.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.657
I told you, motherfucker,
I ain't got your money yet, man.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.287
What the fuck you mean, you ain't
got the money yet, motherfucker?

08:16.454 --> 08:19.415
You best be coming up with my cash
or else, you know what I'm saying?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.417
Fuck you, Tat.

08:22.752 --> 08:27.089
The fuck you think you is, man?
Motherfucking Ron O'Neil or something?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.592
Talking about I better pay or else.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.760
I ain't your bitch, nigga.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.763
What you gonna do?

08:35.307 --> 08:36.932
What...? What am I...?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.726
What am I going to do?

08:40.477 --> 08:42.354
- Hold up, Tat.
- Get the fuck out the way.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.357
No, no, no. Don't squeeze that shit, man.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.362
I'm supposed to be scared now,
because you got a pistol?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.699
I just spent five motherfucking years
in the joint.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.411
I told you I'd pay your monkey ass
when I feel like it.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.790
You better suck my dick.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.460
- Suck on this, motherfucker!
- Damn.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.296
Punk-ass, punk-ass fucking boy.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.134
Tat, Tat, Tat, what the fuck, man?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.970
- What the fuck...?
- You owe me some money, motherfucker?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.972
Hell, no, but here you go.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.362
Hit me.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.322
Here, take it.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.574
Caine.

09:35.742 --> 09:39.495
That was the first time I'd ever seen
my father kill anybody.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.330
But it wasn't the last.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.291
- I got used to it, though.
- Caine.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.296
Caine.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.968
KayDee.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.352
Boulevard South.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.855
It occurred at the Flamingo entrance...

10:08.066 --> 10:10.651
Suspect is...

10:39.723 --> 10:43.600
Whatever you decide to do,
remember what we learned.

10:43.768 --> 10:48.188
And for those of you who are coming back,
I'll see you next year.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.734
For all the bullshit they try to teach you
in high school...

10:51.901 --> 10:55.279
I graduated with about half of it.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.325
But then, I didn't go to school
but half the time.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.619
The other half, I was out selling dope.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.330
Growing up out here...

11:04.497 --> 11:07.124
there was shit that can't be learned
in no classroom.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.584
I just want to say...

11:09.919 --> 11:12.588
- Yo, what's up?
- Is that me? Is that me? Is that me?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.974
What the hell you doing?

11:24.142 --> 11:27.186
Trying to ride this old raggedy thing.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.105
You must want a new Big Wheel.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.942
Yeah, because this old Big Wheel
doesn't work right.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.278
Look, I'm gonna...

11:36.446 --> 11:38.781
- Buy you a new one, okay?
- Okay.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.908
- All right? All right.
- All right.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.619
- What's up, little man? Hey, Caine.
- What's up?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.955
Caine's gonna buy me a new Big Wheel,
Mama.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.791
Oh, is he?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.126
You don't have to keep buying him stuff.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.628
It ain't no thing.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.296
This is my partner right there.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.757
- Ain't that right, little man?
- Yep.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.427
So you finally did it?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.722
Yep. Finally done.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.474
All right.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.268
Oh, man. Congratulations.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.105
Hey, come on.
Let's make it in the house.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.149
Ronnie was Pernell's girl
before he went to the pen.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.568
Anthony came right after that.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.321
Pernell hooked up a house
and a little money for them.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.573
But I still went by to check on them.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.882
My pops was killed in a drug deal
when I was 10.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.676
And my moms was too strung out.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.346
So I went to live with my grandparents
in Jordan Downs.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.852
It was only supposed to be temporary.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.479
But my moms died from an overdose...

12:52.647 --> 12:54.022
so I just stayed.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.024
Hey, Grandma.

13:05.577 --> 13:09.538
Me and your grandpa
are so proud of you, Caine.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.958
Thomas, come on out of that room.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.462
Come on down here
and say hello to our grandson.

13:16.629 --> 13:21.049
The Lord's grace is with you, boy.
And I wanna let you know...

13:21.217 --> 13:23.886
that next week
when you get that diploma...

13:24.053 --> 13:28.640
I'll be the proudest grandfather
in all of L.A.

13:28.808 --> 13:34.229
And I know if your mama and papa was
still alive, they'd be proud of you too.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.942
It's all right.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.704
Let's dip into the cock pot, man.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.955
Graduation night.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.916
My homey Doc threw a party.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.084
- My cousin Harold rode with me.
- What's up?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.254
He stayed down in Long Beach
so we didn't hang out that much.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.839
Now, he was a hustler.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.593
Had a Beemer, a crib, and a fat pocket.

14:04.761 --> 14:08.764
Whenever we were together and some shit
popped off, I never had to worry.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.599
He had my back, and I had his.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.769
Man, we was down
for each other like that.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.522
All the homeys was down for each other.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.068
What's up? What's up?
Caine's in the house.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.112
What's up? What's happening?
What's up?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.241
- Where's the Doc? What's up?
- Caine.

14:27.742 --> 14:30.452
- This is my cousin Harold.
- What's up, motherfucker?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.454
You wanna be on prime time,
motherfucker?

14:32.622 --> 14:34.623
- What?
- Seen your ass on prime time, nigga.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.125
I got the tape.
I got the motherfucking tape.

14:37.293 --> 14:41.296
- I told you. I told you. I'm after bitches.
- The rest of the guys are in back.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.174
What's up, baby?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.096
What's up, Wayne?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.361
How you all doing?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.572
- Yo, what's up?
- Yo, Caine.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.907
What's up, man?

15:09.367 --> 15:12.160
- My motherfucking nigga...
- What's up, man?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.122
Taking these fools money and shit.
You know what's up, nigga.

15:15.290 --> 15:19.209
- Hey, let me talk to you for a minute.
- Hold my motherfucking shit there.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.586
What's up?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.338
You ain't dumb enough to be
showing niggas the robbery tape.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.299
- What's up with that?
- Cool out, nigga.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.385
We just having fun
with the motherfucking tape.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.598
All right, ain't nobody else gonna see
the tape. This shit is funny to me, though.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.183
Hey, man, let me get back to this shit.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.188
- What's up, fool?
- What up, Caine, locster, nigga?

15:40.356 --> 15:42.024
What's up? Where the bud at, fool?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.484
Nigga, watch me break
these motherfuckers here.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.987
Y'all give up this snatch.
Know what I'm saying?

15:47.155 --> 15:50.657
A-Wax was older than the rest of us.
I mean, he was what we called a "G."

15:50.825 --> 15:54.745
Always in the middle of things.
Instigating, arguing, fussing.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.496
He was funny to us.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.707
He had been putting in work
for so long...

15:58.875 --> 16:01.835
it got to a point where he liked to see
other people do dirt.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.465
Now, O-Dog was the craziest nigga alive.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.675
America's nightmare.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.970
Young, black and didn't give a fuck.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.222
Do it, fool.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.058
Oh, man. Nigga crapped out.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.518
Give me my fucking money, nigga.
Give me my shit.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.355
- Crapped out like a motherfucker.
- Y'all fucking bullshit.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.898
Brew's in the cooler.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.234
- Give me my motherfucking money.
- Yo, nigga, throw that money down.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.323
- What's up, black man?
- I'm cooling.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.534
Why you got that hood on your head?
Look like the grim reaper.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.411
It's cold out here, my brother.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.039
You know us black folks not used
to this cold air.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.166
We the tropical people, you understand?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.543
Let them Europeans deal
with this madness.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.214
Then why your tropical ass
sitting on the goddamn cooler?

16:47.590 --> 16:51.259
To keep you fools
from drinking this poison. That's why.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.428
You better get
your shelenkem-shilom ass...

16:53.596 --> 16:56.098
up off this box
and pass me a motherfucking brew.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.184
Sharif was an ex-knucklehead
turned Muslim.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.770
He was so happy
to be learning something he liked...

17:01.938 --> 17:03.772
he kept coming at us with it.

17:03.940 --> 17:07.108
He thought Allah could save black people.
Yeah, right.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.404
Yo, Caine. Toss me one, homey.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.448
Now, Stacy thought he was the pimp
of the bunch.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.450
We was homeys since we were little.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.869
He went to a different high school,
though, because he could play ball.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.705
After he got that scholarship...

17:20.873 --> 17:24.710
he was always talking
about going to Kansas to play football.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.588
I'm telling you, man. I'm straight starving.
I gotta get something to eat, man.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.967
Y'all niggas hurry up, man.
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, man.

17:32.135 --> 17:36.304
Yeah, yeah. Man, I got the munchies
like a motherfucker, boy.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.725
Your big ass eats too much as it is.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.315
- Damn.
- Damn.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.985
What the fuck's going on
out in this motherfucker?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.487
What y'all gonna do?
Me and Harold going to Jack's.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.406
You niggas going to Jack in the Crack?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.450
Yeah, hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.411
Gonna need gas for the hooptie.
You know what I'm saying?

17:59.579 --> 18:03.039
Your ass should have filled up before
we got here. Stupid ass motherfucker.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.500
- Shut up, bitch.
- You all gonna follow us, right?

18:05.668 --> 18:08.462
Yeah, nigga.
We know where it's at, fool.

18:21.893 --> 18:25.854
Go, man. Get the fuck out of here, man.
Get your ass out of here.

18:26.022 --> 18:29.191
We don't need that shit. Damn.
I can't stand when they do that shit.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.359
Who got some snaps on the petro?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.111
I ain't giving you shit.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.030
I'll catch you tomorrow. I promise.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.365
- My pocket is hurting.
- Y'all niggas is broke...

18:37.533 --> 18:41.036
Slanging shit in the 'hood
and y'all ain't got no motherfucking money.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.371
- We'll get you back.
- Fuck. Pump my shit.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.207
Peace.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.837
All that motherfucking money.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.714
Wake up, nigga.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.633
Three dollars.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.676
Fool.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.939
- It is hot as hell.
- Turn off the heater then, man.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.316
- You know what I'm saying?
- Hell, yeah.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.026
Kind of fucked up?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.821
- You crazy. All I had was two 40's.
- Of what?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.073
Two bottles of Ides, baby.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.742
- Yeah, you real fucked up, nigga.
- Fucked.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.203
I'm tired as a motherfucker.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.914
Get your ass up out the car, nigga.

19:26.082 --> 19:30.502
Get the fuck out!
Break yourself, nigga. Break yourself.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.087
Ain't this a bitch!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.506
Get your motherfucking ass up
out the car.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.841
All right, nigga. Chill.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.219
Caine, get out the car, man.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.762
I ain't going like a chump.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.765
Nigga, don't make me rush you.
Get your ass up out the car.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.350
- Get out the car.
- All right.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.728
- Get out!
- All right, nigga. I'm coming.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.023
Nigga, I got you, right.
Get your motherfucking ass up out the car!

19:52.525 --> 19:54.276
- Bitch, move!
- Shoot that nigga.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.111
Nigga, fuck you!

19:56.279 --> 19:58.280
- Oh, shit!
- Get out of the car!

19:58.656 --> 20:01.658
Oh, shit! That's Caine.
Hey, they getting jacked! Come on.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.076
That's Caine and Harold.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.467
Hell, I know that ain't my nigga, man.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.635
Shit.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.013
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.435
Shit. Damn.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.562
- Hey, man, you all right?
- Harold!

20:30.730 --> 20:33.648
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- What about him?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.984
- We gotta do that another time.
- Let's go, man.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.903
We can't leave Harold here like this.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.446
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.657
Hey, man. We can't leave him
like this. It's not right, all right?

20:42.825 --> 20:47.245
Hey, Sharif, that motherfucker's dead.
He's dead, man! Fuck that. Let's go.

20:47.413 --> 20:51.207
- Stacy. Stacy, help me get him in the car.
- I got Caine, man. I got Caine.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.376
Stacy, A-Wax!
Help me get him in the car!

20:53.544 --> 20:56.588
- Sharif, come on, man!
- It ain't right, okay?

20:56.756 --> 21:00.717
- Hey, fuck, you stay with him then.
- I'm staying. I'm staying.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.309
He's bleeding to death.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.936
- What?
- Where the doctor?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.687
Where the doctor at?

21:14.523 --> 21:17.359
Yo, give us a motherfucking doctor.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.195
You'll have to fill out these forms first.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.366
Bitch, fuck the forms. We need a doctor.
He's bleeding to death there!

21:25.409 --> 21:28.995
This bitch can't find us a doctor.
Look at him. He's bleeding.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.830
Get a fucking doctor right now!

21:30.998 --> 21:33.541
- Where's that bitch with the doctor?
- Where's the doctor?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.754
A week out of high school
and I got blasted in the shoulder.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.715
I went to shock
when I saw all that damn blood.

21:40.883 --> 21:45.261
I mean, I ain't never been shot before
so I thought I was gonna die.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.639
They kept me in the hospital
a week or so.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.601
I mostly stayed up thinking about my cousin
and watching old gangster movies.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.228
I've gotta see some identification.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.897
How about my Army discharge? Got it here.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.493
What you doing here?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.913
Are you surprised
or is it that you don't wanna see me?

22:12.081 --> 22:16.084
No. I just thought my grandparents
were gonna come and pick me up.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.919
Well...

22:18.754 --> 22:22.090
I told them they didn't have to.
I told them I would come get you...

22:22.258 --> 22:24.384
and they could stay home and relax.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.262
And your grandmother gave me
your clothes to give to you.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.764
Oh, shit.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.018
First, I get shot.
Then you're gonna drive me home?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.937
Somebody must want me to die.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.522
Trying to say I can't drive?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.859
Yo, Rashid, Rashid, hold up.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.739
- Have you seen my wife?
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!

22:45.906 --> 22:48.825
Kids! Pete.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.373
Kids! Janie, Janie. Tommy.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.296
- Where's your mother?
- Looking for you.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.089
- With Uncle Billy.
- Daddy.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.676
Zuzu. Zuzu, my little ginger snap.
How do you feel?

23:06.844 --> 23:09.971
- Fine. Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of temp...

23:10.723 --> 23:12.265
- Hallelujah.
- Hello.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.436
- George! George, darling.
- Mary, Mary.

23:16.604 --> 23:17.979
George, darling!

23:18.147 --> 23:20.482
- Where have you...?
- What's up, O?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.902
- What's going on, big boy?
- Just chilling, man.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.570
You going to come on out today?

23:25.780 --> 23:27.238
Yeah.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.824
- I'll be in front if you all need...
- KayDee, Kevin.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.202
Come on inside.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.246
What's up with that, man?

23:38.084 --> 23:41.336
Yeah, you come over here
and sit right there on the couch.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.339
Hey, y'all.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.592
Can you stand right over here
by the tree? Right there.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.556
Well, I guess I better let y'all talk.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.813
Now, what I wanna talk
to you two about...

23:59.980 --> 24:02.732
is the trouble
that you've been getting into.

24:02.900 --> 24:07.112
Boys, the Lord didn't put you here
to be shooting and killing each other.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.533
It's right there in the Bible.
Exodus 20:13:

24:11.700 --> 24:13.493
"Thou shall not kill."

24:14.036 --> 24:17.872
- Grandpa, I ain't never killed nobody.
- Oh, I doubt that.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.291
And, Kevin, I've heard stories about you.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.296
Sir, I don't think God really care
too much about us.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.048
Or he wouldn't have put us here.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.051
I mean, look where we stay at.
It's all fuck...

24:33.973 --> 24:35.473
It's messed up around here.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.768
You don't have any belief, boy.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.521
The Lord don't care
about who's got the biggest house.

24:41.772 --> 24:45.567
My grandpops was always coming at us
with that religion.

24:45.734 --> 24:50.196
And every time it would go in one ear
and out the other.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.371
Caine.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.749
Do you care whether you live or die?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.841
I don't know.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.343
Come on, man, let's bail. Come on.

25:16.599 --> 25:20.268
Boy, oh, boy, man. Shit.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.978
Sorry about that, man.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.731
Grandpa can get carried away
with that Bible and shit.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.066
- Hell, yeah, he be in Church every Sunday?
- Faithfully.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.278
I mean, sitting there praying
to a white Jesus.

25:30.446 --> 25:33.114
Man, black people got too much
damn religion as it is.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.908
- What I'm saying.
- But anyway, man.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.621
- What's up on the shoulder, boy?
- It's fucked up, but it ain't no thing.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.081
That ain't what you was hollering
to the hospital.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.791
You was:

25:45.711 --> 25:48.087
You was sounding like a little bitch, man.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.131
Fuck you, man. That shit did hurt.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.593
You fools swear you all so damn hard.
I heard that shit.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.930
- What? Who? Who?
- "Stay up, Caine. Don't die."

25:57.097 --> 25:59.349
- Wasn't me.
- Trying to act caring and sensitive.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.725
Yeah, that was you.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.645
We still mad at you
for dropping all that blood on us, man.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.980
Fuck y'all.
I almost died in that motherfucker.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.901
Shit, man. I was gonna tell you something
before we went up the house, man.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.444
What's up?

26:11.612 --> 26:13.279
Oh, nigga, guess what.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.616
Word got back about the little marks
who jacked you and Harold.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.118
I know where they be kicking it at.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.872
Down with the 187?

26:24.541 --> 26:26.334
Let's do this.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.128
Do this for Harold, man.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.965
Man, you getting down, nigga.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.508
Yo, Wax, check out Caine.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.927
Back there with a 40,
looking like a sucker.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.595
What you get up in there, boy?

26:37.846 --> 26:41.307
Shit. Hey, hey, check this out.
Check this out. Boom!

26:41.475 --> 26:43.601
Yep. Nigga, did y'all see that?

26:43.811 --> 26:45.603
Yeah.

26:47.022 --> 26:50.358
You bad, nigga.
That nigga shot that boy. Straight up, boy.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.902
- Didn't know I had that shit in me.
- Give it to me.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.655
You jacked that Korean!

26:56.490 --> 26:58.825
- You like that shit.
- You always try to put a show.

26:58.993 --> 27:03.079
Yo, dog. Let me get a dub
of this motherfucker, man. This is bad.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.915
Oh, shit. Man, fuck that.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.377
I'm selling these motherfuckers
for 59.95.

27:09.545 --> 27:13.381
- I got money, nigga. Shut up, Wax.
- Fifty dollars, you can have this.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.468
Oh, shit. This gonna be a trip.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.721
Caine ready to put a hole
into the fucker?

27:21.807 --> 27:22.974
Yup.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.226
All right.

27:32.234 --> 27:35.153
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.
- Fuck, man.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.115
- Hey, man, this with the...
- Yo, man! What you doing?

27:39.283 --> 27:41.075
Point that somewhere else. You stupid.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.244
Y'all scared like some bitches.

27:44.246 --> 27:48.333
I seen lots of people killed before
but I ain't never done it myself.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.002
I mean, I never had a reason to.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.171
But when they killed my cousin...

27:53.339 --> 27:55.048
I knew I was gonna kill them.

27:55.215 --> 27:58.468
Hey, man,
so you like my little tape, don't you?

27:58.635 --> 28:00.762
- Yeah, that shit was cool, nigga.
- Yeah, nigga.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.349
- That was proper.
- You should have came to the Wax, boy.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.143
- He could have did it much better.
- Oh, shit, nigga.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.854
It's all about O-Dog, nigga.

28:10.022 --> 28:14.650
I'm larger than that nigga Steven Seagal.
I'm gonna be a big-ass movie star.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.612
Look, nigga. I told you
to stop showing the fucking tape.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.450
Man, why you keep on bitching
about my tape, man?

28:22.618 --> 28:26.287
Goddamn.
Ain't shit gonna happen. All right?

28:26.455 --> 28:27.955
All right?

28:28.123 --> 28:31.376
Damn. Now, we're just gonna find
these little marks and smoke them.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.628
Shit ain't that hard.

28:33.962 --> 28:38.716
As long as there ain't no crowd. I'm not
killing no kids or no old folks, all right?

28:39.134 --> 28:43.346
Hey, man, who the fuck gonna be old
out there at 12:00 at night, man?

28:43.514 --> 28:47.225
Shit, nigga. I smoke anybody, nigga.
I just don't give a fuck. Shit.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.935
I'm gonna hit this shit, nigga.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.105
Look, all right. Not me, all right.
I'm not killing no kids.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.775
You know what, nigga?
You acting like a little bitch right now.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.277
You acting real paranoid and shit.

28:58.445 --> 29:03.032
Now, these motherfuckers smoked your
goddamn cousin in front of you, nigga.

29:03.200 --> 29:07.328
Blew his head off in front of your face
and you ain't gonna do shit?

29:07.496 --> 29:09.831
You acting like a little bitch
right now, nigga.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.208
Man, fuck that.
I ain't letting that shit ride.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.502
We gonna go ahead
and smoke all these fuckers.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.046
I don't care who the fuck out there.
Goddamn it!

29:17.214 --> 29:21.676
- Is you down, nigga?
- Man, both of y'all shut the fuck up!

29:22.302 --> 29:25.012
Both of y'all acting
like some motherfucking bitches.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.640
Scared to peel
these punk-ass niggas' cap.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.852
Man, give me
my motherfucking joint, nigga.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.187
Fuck you, nigga.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.148
Shit.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.025
You go hook us up with them
fucking hot dogs or something.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.945
Why don't you get away begging,
hungry-ass motherfucker?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.281
Hey, who you saying begging?

29:43.449 --> 29:45.158
- You.
- Who you think you are?

29:45.325 --> 29:47.201
- Get a job.
- I ain't gonna beg you.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.328
You go ahead and get us one of them dogs.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.247
I gots money. I sell for my money.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.876
Why don't you go ahead
and hook us up, Dee? What you waiting on?

29:55.169 --> 29:57.545
You hooked us up 50 times.
What you talking about?

29:57.713 --> 30:00.631
I'm tired hooking your sorry ass up.
Go get a goddamn job.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.717
That's what you do to pay for this shit.

30:02.885 --> 30:06.387
The hell are you sweating this?
Take your ass, get us something to eat.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.264
- Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

30:08.432 --> 30:09.474
And fuck you, okay?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.232
You all niggas, hurry up. Go in there.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.152
Book them niggas
and get the fuck out and don't be playing.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.404
Dog, Caine, you hear what I'm saying?

30:23.572 --> 30:25.490
Kill them niggas and get the fuck back...

30:25.657 --> 30:28.242
so we can stab out.
I'm gonna be chilling right here.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.620
Hey, nigga, I wanna know
if you're ready to do this shit.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.040
Are you ready to do this shit
or what, motherfucker?

30:34.208 --> 30:37.502
And don't be acting like no pussy
when we get the fuck out there.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.170
Hey, you wanna go to my house?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.422
My mom's made a big-ass
pot of chitlins.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.925
Let's rush them chitlins.
We don't need no hot dog.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.220
That's where you all need to be,
in the house. You got a curfew.

30:47.387 --> 30:50.723
Why don't you take us and get us
some burger or something, stupid bitch.

30:50.891 --> 30:54.101
Fuck you, nigga.
It's time for both of you all to go, okay?

30:54.770 --> 30:57.021
Let's go to mom's house.
We don't need this shit.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.608
- That's what I'm saying.
- Go home to your mammies, okay?

31:00.776 --> 31:02.068
Yeah, nigga. Break out...!

31:12.204 --> 31:14.622
Bitch, shut the fuck up
before we blast your ass too.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.791
Shut the fuck up.

31:17.584 --> 31:20.002
Hey, homey, you need some help?

31:25.968 --> 31:28.803
Punk-ass nigga. Come on, niggas.

31:37.104 --> 31:40.064
I thought killing those fools
would make me feel good.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.984
But it really didn't make me feel
anything.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.820
I just knew that I could kill somebody.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.863
And if I had to...

31:48.031 --> 31:50.032
I could do it again.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.127
What's up, Caine?

32:01.295 --> 32:02.336
How you doing today?

32:02.504 --> 32:04.130
I'm all right.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.717
That's good.
I'm tired. I'm in there studying.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.011
- You want something to eat?
- No. I'm straight.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.971
Okay, have a seat.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.769
So where's Anthony?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.354
He's in the back taking a nap.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.316
He should be up in a second, actually.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.320
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. You know where it is.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.206
Shit.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.547
I got some money
this time, man. I got $2.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.382
You ain't got no money, nigga.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.343
Where that motherfucking 20 at?

32:50.761 --> 32:53.721
Nigga, come with 20, nigga.
You owe me a dub from last week.

32:53.889 --> 32:57.683
Oh, nigga, much as I buy from you,
you gonna trip about that? Come on, man.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.894
Look, man. I got $2 for you, man.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.396
I know I'm a little short but...

33:02.564 --> 33:04.565
- You know...
- You a motherfucking fool.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.693
- Come with 20, nigga. Come with 20.
- Man, I ain't got nothing.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.570
- Come on.
- Hand nigga's money back.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.197
Give me my $2 back, man.

33:11.365 --> 33:14.075
I'll go buy a cheeseburger, man.
Let me go buy a burger.

33:14.409 --> 33:18.537
Man, as much as I buy from you,
you gonna come on me like that, man?

33:21.583 --> 33:22.583
Get that fuck...

33:24.419 --> 33:25.586
Leave me alone.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.756
I gotta save, man.
Come on, man, give me my money back.

33:31.093 --> 33:32.593
Hey, get Weed. Get Weed.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.388
- Caine?
- What's up?

33:35.722 --> 33:37.598
Wanna play me in boxing?

33:38.850 --> 33:41.435
- What do you think?
- I'll whoop your ass.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.438
Anthony, what did I tell you
about your mouth?

33:45.357 --> 33:48.609
- What? Why you tripping?
- What do you mean, why am I tripping?

33:48.777 --> 33:51.862
Because he's 5 years old
and he has no business talking like that.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.532
Well, you gotta
be hard growing up out here.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.661
Caine, that has nothing to do
with being hard, okay?

33:58.829 --> 34:02.123
Because he gets that crap from you,
Dog, and that fool, Stacy.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.376
Well, Pernell showed me what's up.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.212
And? Is that something to be proud of?

34:11.507 --> 34:14.635
And speaking of his father,
I got a letter from him today.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.472
- He asked about you.
- For real?

34:18.974 --> 34:20.474
- What's he up to?
- Nothing.

34:21.268 --> 34:24.728
Lifting and trying to read every book
in the library.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.940
When I'm done in here,
I'll get you your letter.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.900
All right, cool.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.652
I'm gonna be whooping your son's ass
in this game.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.947
I mean...

34:35.114 --> 34:36.866
we're gonna box and shit.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.868
I mean, you know, a little some...

34:39.034 --> 34:41.911
Come on, Anthony. Let's just... Come on.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.581
I'm gonna beat your butt.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.753
- Get out of here. Damn.
- I made these cheeseburgers, man.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.670
What's with your motherfucking teeth?

34:50.839 --> 34:54.175
That's from all the cheese I've
been eating. You want burgers? Come on.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.303
- Fuck out of here, man. You stink.
- Oh, shit. One time.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.929
- Break!
- Go around. Yo, come on.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.347
Go around.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.688
Move, man. Move, move.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.871
Hold up.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.084
Now I'm gonna wear you out, little punk.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.380
Let me see that.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.550
The gun.

35:41.389 --> 35:44.391
All right. Where did I put that letter?

35:45.852 --> 35:47.186
Oh, here we go.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.271
Is this it? Yeah.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.322
Now, see, you hold it like this
and pull the trigger.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.242
Pow! Punk-ass.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.244
Look, it ain't loaded.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.079
What the hell are you doing?

36:05.247 --> 36:07.915
I don't want my son
learning to pull drive-bys!

36:08.083 --> 36:11.544
- I was just showing him how to shoot.
- Yeah, Mama.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.421
Anthony, get over here. Get over here.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.759
Let me tell you something.

36:18.927 --> 36:23.681
If I ever catch you with a gun in your hand,
I'm gonna break your tail. You got that?

36:24.349 --> 36:25.391
Get out of here.

36:25.559 --> 36:28.102
Get up and get out.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.109
How many times do I have to tell you
to stop giving us money?

36:35.277 --> 36:36.777
Don't give me that shit, okay?

36:37.112 --> 36:39.864
Because I don't see nobody
with no fucking job around here.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.908
You know what?
I don't need your money.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.202
Look...

36:45.370 --> 36:47.246
Pernell looked out for me, okay?

36:47.414 --> 36:50.207
- If it wasn't for him... No. Listen.
- Don't start...

36:50.375 --> 36:53.043
If it wasn't for him,
my black ass would be dead by now.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.462
- I'm paying back.
- You know what? Fuck Pernell.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.798
Because you don't owe him shit,
all right?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.634
You need to be glad
that you graduated from high school...

37:00.802 --> 37:02.303
and that you're alive at 18.

37:02.470 --> 37:06.265
You need to do something with yourself
before you end up like he did.

37:07.517 --> 37:10.144
Look, I'm not gonna end up like he did,
all right?

37:10.312 --> 37:11.645
Oh, really?

37:11.813 --> 37:15.149
Why you tripping? You act like you
never was down. What's up with that?

37:15.317 --> 37:18.277
Caine, it's not even about being down,
all right?

37:18.445 --> 37:21.280
I got a little son to look after.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.949
And you know what's really sad?

37:24.117 --> 37:25.993
Is that I look at you...

37:26.161 --> 37:30.205
and you remind me
of how Pernell used to be.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.208
- Yeah, and?
- Yeah, and what?

37:34.628 --> 37:36.337
Look at you.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.756
I gotta go, all right? Here.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.595
Cool.

37:47.849 --> 37:48.849
This is the good part.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.437
- Yeah.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.647

37:54.814 --> 37:57.691

37:57.859 --> 38:00.527
- Who that?

38:00.695 --> 38:02.404
- Hey, where you at?
- What's up, man?

38:02.572 --> 38:04.365

38:11.331 --> 38:13.082
So what's up? We gonna roll or what?

38:13.249 --> 38:15.542
- So you down with rolling tonight?
- Oh, it's on.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.086

38:19.673 --> 38:22.007
Turn this shit off, man.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.718
- Wake that fool to answer the door.

Yo, who is it?

38:44.072 --> 38:45.572
Nick?

38:47.701 --> 38:50.536
- Yo, nigga, what up?
- Nothing.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.122
Why you come so early
all the time, man?

38:53.289 --> 38:56.917
- You said 1:00.
- I don't give a fuck what I said, nigga.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.879
I don't get out of bed before 2:30.
Don't come through this so early next time.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.631
Understood.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.384

- Go ahead, Nick.
- It's gotta be...

39:27.782 --> 39:29.658
in excellent running condition too.

39:29.826 --> 39:33.078
Insurance company ain't gonna give money
for a car that doesn't run.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.040
- Can you hang with this?
- Yeah, I'll hook you up.

You ain't too scared to have a black man
steal for your funky ass.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.564

40:00.732 --> 40:02.107

42:30.798 --> 42:32.799

42:33.218 --> 42:35.052
Since it was my first offense...

42:35.678 --> 42:38.263
Well, actually, the first time
I ever been caught for anything...

42:38.431 --> 42:40.933
the judge reduced
my crime from grand theft auto...

42:41.100 --> 42:42.684
to attempted joyriding.

42:42.852 --> 42:46.313
They let O-Dog off with a warning
because he was still a minor.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.148
My dad had been to jail before.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.441
Pernell went to jail.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.985
I mean,
even O-Dog had been to youth camp.

42:52.153 --> 42:56.531
But I didn't care what any of them said.
It was no place I could get used to.

42:58.618 --> 43:01.161
Motherfucker, you don't own me, nigga.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.340
Man, you got some money or not?

43:13.508 --> 43:15.842
Come on, man.
Why don't you hook me up this time?

43:16.010 --> 43:17.886
Nigga, you crazy? Hook you up?

43:18.054 --> 43:20.097
- Get the fuck out of here.

43:20.265 --> 43:22.516
Got these burgers.
They some double cheeseburgers.

43:22.684 --> 43:24.559
Nigga, I just ate. I just ate, fool.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.687
I don't want
no motherfucking cheeseburger.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.189
If you ain't got no money,
you just assed out.

43:29.357 --> 43:30.691
Call this motherfucker.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.484

43:40.994 --> 43:42.536

43:45.999 --> 43:47.040

43:47.208 --> 43:49.626

43:50.003 --> 43:52.004
O-Dog, what the fuck you doing?

43:52.171 --> 43:53.547
Yo, Dog! Hurry up!

43:56.050 --> 43:58.385
Any of you all want a hamburger?

43:59.053 --> 44:01.638
What's wrong?
You don't want no hamburger?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.725
- I don't want no hamburger.
- Even if it got cheese on it?

44:04.892 --> 44:07.060
- Man, you stupid.
- I got it from that basehead.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.729
You stupid.

44:11.649 --> 44:12.899
I didn't even have a record...

44:13.067 --> 44:16.069
but when they fingerprinted me,
the cops matched my prints...

44:16.237 --> 44:20.866
to the ones from that bottle I dropped in
the liquor store the night of the robbery.

45:08.581 --> 45:11.083
Now, listen to me, you little bitch.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.089
I'm gonna ask you
some real simple questions...

45:17.256 --> 45:19.800
and I want some real simple answers.

45:20.385 --> 45:21.968
You understand?

45:26.057 --> 45:28.016
Let me get this right.

45:30.436 --> 45:33.146
You bought the bottle of beer...

45:34.399 --> 45:36.733
about 11:15?

45:37.777 --> 45:40.862
Ye... I bought the beer
and I accidentally dropped it.

45:41.030 --> 45:45.158
You bought the bottle of beer...

45:45.952 --> 45:47.577
at 11:15?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.538

45:49.705 --> 45:50.747
At 11:15, I...

45:50.915 --> 45:53.333
Yeah, 11:15.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.502
Then why wasn't the bottle cleaned up?

45:55.670 --> 45:58.839
- Why did we find it still...
- Be...

46:00.258 --> 46:01.550
there...

46:01.717 --> 46:04.302
spilt on the floor...

46:04.470 --> 46:06.721
after the shoot?

46:06.889 --> 46:07.931
When I was...

46:08.099 --> 46:12.185
After we was leaving, after I left...
Pe... Other people was coming in.

46:12.353 --> 46:13.979
They... When we was leaving.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.857
- But you don't remember what they...?
- What they look...

46:17.024 --> 46:23.029
But you bought the bottle of beer
definitely at 12:15?

46:23.197 --> 46:25.532
Yeah, it was 12:15, exact.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.118
- If I'm not mistaken, it...
- Now, you see something?

46:30.538 --> 46:32.289
Now, you see, now...

46:32.457 --> 46:34.666

No, I thought...

46:39.130 --> 46:41.047
Yo, I'm saying you done fucked up now.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.507
You know that, don't you?

46:44.260 --> 46:46.720
The more questions that cop asked...

46:46.888 --> 46:50.015
the more I thought
I wasn't gonna never see daylight again.

46:50.183 --> 46:53.059
And this time, you said
you bought the bottle of beer...

46:53.227 --> 46:56.480
I was just waiting for them to tell me
they seen that damn videotape.

46:56.647 --> 46:57.898
But they hadn't.

46:58.065 --> 46:59.316
Yeah... I...

46:59.484 --> 47:01.735
You know you done fucked up,
don't you?

47:01.903 --> 47:03.778
- I...

47:05.239 --> 47:06.531
You know you done fucked up.

47:06.699 --> 47:07.949
Without the tape...

47:08.117 --> 47:10.035
they had nothing.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.421
What's wrong with my brother?

47:21.589 --> 47:24.257
He's sick as a dog. Look at him.

47:26.427 --> 47:28.929
Caine, man. It's Stacy and Sharif.
You all right, man?

47:29.764 --> 47:31.932
Hell, no. I ain't shit in a week.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.434
Goddamn. In a week.

47:34.602 --> 47:37.562
Come on, brother. You wasn't there
long enough to catch the HIV.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.023
Fuck you.

47:40.650 --> 47:42.901
What you fools want anyway?

47:43.069 --> 47:45.946
You still want me to take you
to get this car or what?

47:47.156 --> 47:48.657
Hold on.

47:49.075 --> 47:52.202
Come on, get up from off your knees,
praying to that porcelain god.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.788
That white porcelain god.

47:54.956 --> 47:57.457
Why don't you chill, Farrakhan?

47:58.251 --> 48:00.794
Hey, man, you better not throw up
in my ride, man.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.797
Ain't nobody gonna throw up
in your ride.

48:21.732 --> 48:24.651
Say, homey, why don't you
come to Kansas with us?

48:25.152 --> 48:26.486
What, nigga?

48:26.654 --> 48:28.863
You all need to stop
calling each other "nigga."

48:29.031 --> 48:30.657
That's what you need to stop doing.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.492
Anyways...

48:32.660 --> 48:35.328
nigga, I said you should come
up to Kansas with us.

48:35.496 --> 48:36.997
You going deaf, motherfucker?

48:38.874 --> 48:40.500
You going to Kansas with this fool?

48:40.668 --> 48:42.252
Yeah, Caine. You should come too.

48:42.420 --> 48:46.256
I mean, you're not doing nothing here
but getting yourself in a lot of trouble.

48:46.424 --> 48:47.966
Your grandmother would be happy.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.343
Shit, I ain't going no place.

48:50.845 --> 48:53.346
I think Ronnie got a lock
on this fool is what I think.

48:53.848 --> 48:56.266
- Fool, you tripping.
- Caine.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.519
Wait. You still
pushing up on Ronnie, man?

49:00.021 --> 49:02.355
Man, hell, no. Pernell would kick my ass.

49:02.940 --> 49:03.982
Oh, shit.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.901
Nigga, on life without parole?
I don't think so.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.195
You spend enough time
up in that motherfucker.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.364
You should be trying to fuck.

49:11.532 --> 49:13.783
I know I'd be trying to fuck.
What about you?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.161
Yeah. Whatever. Here, put that in for me.

49:16.329 --> 49:18.955
You better go somewhere
with that black power shit.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.207
You know that shit gets no play
in this ride.

49:21.626 --> 49:24.544
Man, I wish this motherfucker
would hurry up.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.382
Oh, there that motherfucker go
right there, shit.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.218
What's up? You all gonna kick it?

49:32.720 --> 49:35.180
No, man,
I gotta go scoop up one of my kids.

49:35.348 --> 49:37.724
All right, man.
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brother.

49:40.061 --> 49:42.062
What is that, man?
Get that shit out my face.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.064
That's for Junior and shit, man.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.066
Now get your ass in the front seat, man.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.740
This is the ride, bro.

50:07.797 --> 50:10.215
- Hey, you got the bread?
- Shut up.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.302
This shit legit?

50:14.470 --> 50:16.763
Hey, I told you, man.
My brother works at the DMV.

50:16.931 --> 50:18.264
All the numbers are clean.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.934
I had the dope ride...

50:21.102 --> 50:23.687
but I was sitting on some bullshit.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.189
I needed some rims bad.

50:26.565 --> 50:29.067
And I knew just how to get them.

50:29.235 --> 50:31.111
And I sure in the hell
wasn't gonna pay for them.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.074
All I had to do
was catch some fool slipping...

50:36.242 --> 50:37.701
and jack his ass.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.989
- Turn that motherfucking shit down.
- Shit.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.742
Nigga, what the fuck
you want from me?

51:18.909 --> 51:20.660
Nigga, you know what the fuck I want.

51:20.828 --> 51:23.621
I want your motherfucking Daytons
and your stereo.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.833
- And I'll take a double burger with cheese.
- What?

51:27.001 --> 51:29.836
Wha...?
Motherfucker, order my motherfucking food.

51:30.004 --> 51:32.422
Hi, may I take your order please?

51:32.590 --> 51:33.882
Yeah...

51:34.633 --> 51:37.177
let me have a double burger...

51:37.344 --> 51:40.263
- Some fries...
- Motherfucker, I said with cheese, nigga.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.056
Shit.

51:42.641 --> 51:45.685
Hey, yo,
make that a double burger with cheese.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.188
You almost made me shoot your ass
over nothing.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.857
Hey, come on, man.
We supposed to be brothers.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.859
Oh, what, you trying to get smart?

51:53.027 --> 51:55.278
Oh, you trying to catch some mileage?
Fuck that.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.197
Give me your motherfucking jewelry.

51:57.364 --> 51:58.615
- Take that shit off.
- Shit.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.535
You got a pager too.
You're a baller? You a baller?

52:02.703 --> 52:05.121
Yo, give me this motherfucking shit.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.457
Better me than the motherfucking cops.

52:08.209 --> 52:09.876
Yo, what's up?

52:11.045 --> 52:12.837
Chilling.

52:13.672 --> 52:17.717
Yeah. I had to creep up
on some fool today at the drive-through.

52:18.594 --> 52:21.596
Trying the high sign and shit.
I had to get him.

52:23.098 --> 52:24.599
Yeah, but a trip.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.018
A nigga straight on short.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.480
Yeah. I need you to hook me up
with some shit.

52:43.369 --> 52:44.577
How much you want, nigga?

52:44.745 --> 52:46.204
Give me like 400.

52:46.372 --> 52:48.706
All right, give him 400, man.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.875
- What up?
- What's up, black?

52:51.043 --> 52:52.836
How much you all fools got back there?

52:53.003 --> 52:55.463
Got enough.
You gotta make this shit up yourself.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.424
- I'm gonna watch this motherfucking video.
- All right.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.260
- What's up, nigga?
- Chilling.

53:00.427 --> 53:03.263
Everything you need
up on this damn sink.

53:03.639 --> 53:05.765
Clean up before you leave.
This better be 400.

53:05.933 --> 53:08.601
Oh, don't even
come at me like that, partner.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.722
Working for minimum wage
was never my style.

53:45.890 --> 53:47.974
I like big dollars.

53:48.142 --> 53:50.184
I learned how to mix drugs
when I was little.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.271
Heroin, cocaine, all of it.

53:53.439 --> 53:54.981
My dad taught me.

53:55.149 --> 53:58.443
That was about the only thing
he taught me before he was killed.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.558
You in my way.
What the hell are you doing?

54:30.726 --> 54:33.478
Hey, calm down, baby.
That's one of my natural reflexes.

54:33.646 --> 54:35.855
Oh, so what? You like being in my way?

54:36.023 --> 54:37.190
What you think?

54:37.358 --> 54:39.359
Hey, they call me Caine.

54:41.111 --> 54:43.863
- I'm Ilena.
- Ilena?

54:46.241 --> 54:48.493
Goddamn. This shit is gonna be good.

54:48.661 --> 54:51.037
Real good. Real good.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.373
- What up?
- The Holy Koran says if you...

54:53.540 --> 54:55.375
I don't wanna hear that shit right now.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.586
- How you be talking to the other bitch?
- Watch your mouth.

54:58.754 --> 55:02.215
Yo, Wax.
Turn that motherfucker up, man.

55:02.383 --> 55:03.883
Shit.

55:04.218 --> 55:05.885
What's up, girl?

55:07.721 --> 55:09.639
Yo, Stacy.

55:09.807 --> 55:10.932
What up?

55:11.100 --> 55:14.602
That nigga Caine out there trying to play
Mack Daddy in the parking lot?

55:14.770 --> 55:17.897
Nigga, yeah. That's that nigga, man.
Trying to be me and shit.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.525
Hey, yo, Caine. What's up, nigga?

55:20.693 --> 55:22.068
Hey, what's up, nigga?

55:22.236 --> 55:23.653
Man, leave that bitch alone.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.697
Nigga, what's up?

55:29.410 --> 55:30.827
I'm gonna call you, all right?

55:30.995 --> 55:32.745
- Yeah.
- You take care of that body.

55:38.252 --> 55:39.877
What up?

55:40.045 --> 55:41.212
- What's up, fools?
- Hey.

55:41.380 --> 55:42.797
- What's up?
- What's up, man?

55:42.965 --> 55:46.092
The fool think he hard,
now that he a little convict and shit.

55:46.260 --> 55:48.302
Hey, man, fuck you.

55:48.554 --> 55:51.472
Hey, which one of you fools
put this picnic together, anyway?

55:51.640 --> 55:55.101
I don't know, but a nigga like Stace
gotta get his eat on and shit, man.

55:55.269 --> 55:58.021
- Hell, yeah.
- Lew-Loc over there bullshitting on the grill.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.606
- What's up with that fool?
- The meat is ready.

56:00.774 --> 56:02.442
- Hell, yeah.
- What's up, fool?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.444
Yo, hold up, man.

56:06.321 --> 56:09.365
- Hold up, man.
- Watch out, man. Calm down.

56:09.533 --> 56:11.075
- I got this piece.
- Not too close.

56:11.243 --> 56:12.285
Hey, chill, boy.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.705
- Yeah, I'm out.
- Why the fuck you let this nigga win again?

56:16.832 --> 56:18.082
- Shit.
- Fuck you, nigga.

56:18.250 --> 56:20.793
I won and I'm out, so pay me.

56:20.961 --> 56:23.212
Pay me in bud.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.422
Hey, hey, Sharif.

56:24.590 --> 56:26.591
Hey, man, is that your pops over there?

56:26.759 --> 56:29.510
That's him. Where you coming
from with a smile on your face?

56:29.678 --> 56:31.971
- What's up, Mr. Butler?
- I smelled that barbecue.

56:32.139 --> 56:34.265
You all know,
I ain't passing up on a barbecue.

56:34.433 --> 56:36.726
- Oh, we heard that.
- Pops wanna get his eat on.

56:36.894 --> 56:38.478
- Let me sit down, here.
- Go ahead.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.272
Now, I know
there's some food left, right?

56:41.482 --> 56:43.608
Hey, hey. Hey, Keisha! Keisha!

56:43.776 --> 56:46.152
- What, nigga?
- Bring Mr. Butler a plate.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.404
A nice size plate, Keisha.

56:48.572 --> 56:50.156
Anyway, Pops, I'm glad you come...

56:50.324 --> 56:53.493
because I was talking to my brothers
about drugs, the community.

56:53.660 --> 56:56.871
I always seem to be outnumbered.
I just wanna know your opinion of it.

56:57.039 --> 57:00.958
You know, well, as I see Kevin trying
to hide that reefer, it's okay to smoke it.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.836
I used to smoke a little reefer myself
when I was younger.

57:04.004 --> 57:06.255
Bet you ain't never smoked
the chronic, though.

57:07.299 --> 57:09.675
I ain't never...
I don't know nothing about the...

57:10.344 --> 57:14.263
They're not doing nothing but destroying
their minds, falling into the devil's plan.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.390
What the hell is the devil's plan, nigga?

57:16.558 --> 57:18.893
This is the devil's plan.
That's the devil's plan.

57:19.061 --> 57:20.686
- Don't throw it on me.
- All right.

57:20.854 --> 57:23.523
Hey, don't throw away
my motherfucking joint.

57:23.690 --> 57:24.982
Hey, 'Rif.

57:25.150 --> 57:26.859
Man, why you always tripping, man?

57:27.027 --> 57:30.113
- I know. Calm your boy down.
- I mean, you got a father, man.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.406
And you got a grandmother
and a grandfather.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.535
I'm pretty sure they tell you
everything that my father tell me.

57:35.702 --> 57:38.329
But you don't listen anyway,
so, what's the difference?

57:38.497 --> 57:41.874
No, no, man. Hold on. Mr. Butler, man.

57:42.334 --> 57:45.419
I'm just curious to know
what's up about that, you know...

57:45.587 --> 57:47.922
Sharif be coming at us every day.
I mean what...?

57:48.090 --> 57:50.133
- Straight up.
- Why does he act like this?

57:50.300 --> 57:53.386
- What are you all talking about at home?
- Sharif's a good guy, man.

57:53.637 --> 57:55.972
That girl a little slow on that plate,
ain't she?

57:56.140 --> 57:57.723
- Hey, Keisha!
- Hey, hurry up.

57:57.891 --> 57:59.392
Bring the motherfucking plate.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.602
Excuse my language.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.439
- Why do you think that's so funny?
- Because it is.

58:05.607 --> 58:07.066
You know, I could see it now.

58:07.234 --> 58:09.235
You're gonna go up there
and mess around...

58:09.403 --> 58:13.072
and bring back
one of your devils to my house.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.741
Wait. You know
I'm not bringing no devil to the house.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.119
Oh, I see you checking out
them white girls.

58:18.287 --> 58:21.581
You know how I feel about black women.
Why you go and throw that on me?

58:21.748 --> 58:24.750
I ought to take you outside
and knock you out. Right now.

58:24.918 --> 58:26.085
Hey, hey, hey, boy.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.461
I brought you in...

58:27.629 --> 58:30.631
- I'll take you out.
- Yeah, okay.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.596
What's up, Caine?
It took you long enough, my brother.

58:36.763 --> 58:39.473
- Anyway.
- Hey, KayDee.

58:39.641 --> 58:41.350
You know, so what's up, young buck?

58:41.518 --> 58:42.810
- Man, I'm all right.
- Yeah?

58:42.978 --> 58:44.270
- How's work?
- You know...

58:44.438 --> 58:47.648
white man always on your back,
but what else is new?

58:47.816 --> 58:49.442
Have a seat.

58:50.110 --> 58:51.861
- What's up, man? Chilling.
- What's up?

58:52.029 --> 58:53.696
So, what you all talking about?

58:53.864 --> 58:57.867
- Not much, just chatting.
- Yeah, we're talking about this Kansas trip.

58:59.119 --> 59:00.620
Kansas?

59:00.787 --> 59:02.747
So, what about Kansas?

59:04.958 --> 59:07.543
So, what are you gonna do, KayDee?

59:08.378 --> 59:11.380
You gonna fuck around out there
in the streets...

59:11.548 --> 59:12.965
until you get killed?

59:13.383 --> 59:15.509
Like your cousin, maybe?

59:15.844 --> 59:17.136
What's that, sir?

59:17.679 --> 59:20.681
Well, Sharif tells me him and Stacy...

59:20.849 --> 59:23.226
have been trying
to get you to leave with them.

59:25.979 --> 59:27.813
Yeah...

59:29.942 --> 59:31.651
but I don't know about no Kansas.

59:32.361 --> 59:35.363
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I hear you there, you know?

59:35.530 --> 59:38.824
I was teasing Sharif
about that before you came in.

59:38.992 --> 59:41.911
But what are you gonna do if you stay?

59:43.580 --> 59:47.708
You know, Sharif used to get
into all kinds of shit...

59:47.876 --> 59:50.086
before he found the Nation.

59:50.504 --> 59:52.546
Now, I'm no Muslim.

59:52.881 --> 59:54.173
But I agree...

59:54.341 --> 59:57.468
with some of the things they say
regarding black people.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:03.432
And if Allah helps to make him
a better man than Jesus can...

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.018
then I'm all for it.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.982
What you trying to say, Mr. Butler?

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.777
Whatever changes you have to make...

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:17.113
then you just do it.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.534
You gotta think about your life.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.789
Being a black man in America...

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:28.791
isn't easy.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:32.461
The hunt is on.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.549
And you're the prey.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.512
All I'm saying is...

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:44.557
All I'm saying is...

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.601
survive.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.645
All right?

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.272
Mr. Butler had me thinking...

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.232
because he was the only one
who ever came at me...

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:55.026
like he gave a damn.

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.570
And Grandpops always kicked
that religious stuff...

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.655
and my dad never said anything.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.199
Pernell showed me
how to survive on the streets...

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.994
but Mr. Butler was talking
about surviving for good.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.247
How did it go between you and that girl
you met at the barbeque?

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.416
- Oh, the baby in the black shorts?
- Yeah.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.752
Yeah, I fucked her.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:16.088
- I did, fool.
- Yeah. Well, I hope you wore a hat...

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.758
because a couple of brothers
eased up in that.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:21.135
Come on, now.
Don't even play me like that.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:25.222
You know I'm packing a plastic. Shit. I
ain't going out like Willy Lump-Lump.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.392
Well, if you don't pack the plastic,
you're definitely going out.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.770
I don't know
if it's like Willy Lump-Lump.

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.605
Whoever that is.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:34.607
Who is Willy Lump-Lump?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.152
Oh, a little inside thing. It ain't nothing.
It ain't nothing.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:42.615
Growing up in the 'hood, we were used
to getting sweated by the cops.

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:45.743
I mean, they would follow us
in the car, then turn away.

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:48.704
I mean, they would stop us
for no reason and question us.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:52.375
Especially with a car like mine,
a 5.0 and Daytons?

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.626
I knew we was in for it.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:56.045
Hands on the hood and spread your legs.

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.713
This motherfucking hood is hot.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.424
Are your hands burning?
I thought you boys liked barbecue.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:02.385
- Why don't get somebody's...?
- Shut up.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.387
- You got a smart mouth.
- Get on there.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.263
What's up with reading me my rights?

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.641
- Shut up.
- Why don't you just read me my rights?

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.018
My tags are up to date, man.
I got registration.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:14.105
- Yeah. That's enough. Come on.
- Read me my rights!

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.816
Just because I'm a black man,
that's why. A black man.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.276
I'm gonna beat your motherfucking ass!

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.112
- That's why...
- Shut the fuck up!

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.613
If I was white...!

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:27.201
- Get the fuck in the car, both you guys.
- Oh, shit!

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:29.036
Fuck, man. This thing hurts.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.997
- What the fuck you doing to us?
- Quit fucking moving!

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.959
- Hey, fuck this, man!
- Stop fucking moving!

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.545
- Stop! The hell, are you crazy?
- Shit! Shit!

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:41.757
Shut the fuck up!
I told you to quit fucking moving!

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:46.637
Hey, get me the wire cutters, ése.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.764
Fuck you, holmes. I ain't doing this shit.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.559
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go with me?

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:52.768
You take care of it.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.855
Hey, what's your fucking problem, man?

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.131
- That's cool.
- Take care of it.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.383
But don't forget, all right, holmes?

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.901
- Hey, check it out, holmes.
- What's up?

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:45.654
What is it, holmes?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.366
- See? Over there.
- Let's move on them, ése.

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.285
Don't sweat it, ése.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.042
That night, the cops let us have it.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:01.420
They dropped us off
in the wrong 'hood, where the éses stay.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.423
I guess they was thinking
we'd get our ass kicked even more.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.258
The éses was cool, though.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.385
They took us to the hospital.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:13.724
You know you can read this yourself.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:17.770
- I know, but I like it when you read it.
- Okay.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:21.565
Mom, why'd the police beat up
Caine and Sharif?

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.984
Did they do something bad?

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.738
No, I don't think they did.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:30.699
I think it was a big mistake.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:34.328
You know? Just a big mistake.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:38.374
Like the same kind of mistake
ever happened to Daddy?

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.670
No, what happened to Daddy
was something different.

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:45.089
You know, with Caine...

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.425
Well, see, you have
a certain group of people...

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:51.971
that don't like another group
of people for whatever reasons.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.806
And the police...

01:04:53.974 --> 01:04:57.309
didn't like Caine and Sharif very much.

01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:59.979
My friend Michael says
the police hate black people.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:02.106
Well, no, no, no. That's not true.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:06.944
- That's not true at all. Some of us...
- Mom, is Caine gonna die?

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.072
No.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.199
Caine's not gonna die.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:14.326
Caine's gonna be just fine.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:17.496
Okay? So don't worry about it.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:19.331
He'll be fine.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.837
You look so mean.
Why don't you smile for a change?

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:30.342
I ain't got shit to smile about.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.177
You're alive, ain't you?

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.723
Yeah, and who says that's good?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.852
Well, guess what.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.687
I got a job.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.731
- For real?
- Yup. Sure did.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.316
My aunt hooked it up for me.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:48.777
Making decent money too.
It's about 24 a year.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.321
What are you gonna be doing?

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:53.699
I will be doing office stuff,
thank you very much.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.951
You know, filing, typing...

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.704
- That's cool. That's cool.
- Answering the phone...

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.914
getting coffee.

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.168
Stuff like that.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:11.759
Caine.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.808
The job is in Atlanta.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.896
Caine.

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:31.403
Did you hear me?
I said the job is in Atlanta.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.113
Hey, take it.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:36.200
I mean, you might as well
get the hell away from here.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:41.747
Well...

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:44.083
to be honest...

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.922
you know what I was hoping?

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:53.342
I was hoping
that maybe you would come with me.

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:56.220
Came with you?

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:57.680
Yeah, I mean...

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.641
you ain't doing jack shit here.
And the way I see it...

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.726
you'll be dead or you'll be in jail.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.603
I mean...

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:08.107
I don't know.
I don't see it as such a bad idea.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.861
Why are you so worried about me?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.493
Why shouldn't I be?

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.878
Think about leaving, Caine.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:45.644
I got to thinking about all the things
I done on the streets...

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:49.648
and all the things
I probably would end up doing if I stayed.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:55.070
I mean, being on the streets was cool.

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:57.489
But I cared about Ronnie.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.826
And, well, Anthony.

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:04.246
He reminded me of me when I was little.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:08.041
I didn't want him to grow up
and go through what I've been through.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.296
It was all so crazy.

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:15.215
I mean, things
was starting to look different to me.

01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:21.680
It was the end of the summer.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:22.973
Ronnie had a little going-away party.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.852
She and Anthony
were getting ready to move to Atlanta.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:30.272
And Stacy and Sharif
were getting ready to leave for Kansas.

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:33.233
Why are you drinking up all the beer?

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:35.527
I don't know what you been
going on with that.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.322
Could you please save some beer
for somebody else?

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:39.615
Oh, who, like Caine?

01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:42.868
- Whenever that fucker come...
- See, Caine, that's the key word.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:45.703
You ain't Caine.
Stop drinking up all the beer.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.332
You're all on his nut sack.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.670
- Hey, y'all.
- What's up?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:56.256
I'm gonna go in this game,
take some of y'all money.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.551
Why don't you go over there
and try and talk to a girl for a change.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:01.053
Why don't you wash your feet?

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.888
- Stinking ass.
- You kiss my ass.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.264
You got one, motherfucker.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:05.849
- Hey.
- Like I was saying...

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.725
how can we say that we're equal...

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:10.562
- When we gotta go to them for jobs?
- Cut that bullshit.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.689
- Get up.
- I was talking to the lady.

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:14.399
She don't wanna hear that shit.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.236
Like I was saying, we're not equal
until we have the same amount...

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.906
- Who is it?
- Five-O, nigga. Five-O.

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.450
I'm selling encyclopedias, motherfucker.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:27.203
- Oh, y'all brought jokes.
- What up, what up, what up?

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.915
- Please.
- Mr. Wax in the house.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.960
- Hey.
- And the 'hood rat's in the house.

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.252
'Hood rats?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.714
Don't start that 'hood rat shit.
You know ain't nobody no 'hood rat.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:41.176
- Don't let me break on your ass.
- Hey, where's Ronnie's fine ass at?

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.970
- Break something on me?
- Yo, baby.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:46.223
- Yo, yo, yo, what up?
- What up, what up?

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:52.520
Stacy, how many times I gotta tell you?
Don't smoke that when Anthony's home.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.983
- Goddamn, what you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.902
Go take that shit outside.

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:02.281
- Can you take it now, please.
- You wanna to go outside with me?

01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:06.952
Hey, little man, what you doing?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.121
Just playing games.

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:12.749
You know, if you need anything,
I'm right in the next room.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.543
I'm thirsty.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.169
Can I have some beer?

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:17.546
Beer? No.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.965
You may have some juice.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:26.054
Hey, this is for the homeys
who ain't here.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.891
My motherfucking cousin Harold.

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:32.728
Hey, Reef, why don't you go
and get a little hit of this?

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.692
- It's all right, Kevin.
- Oh, man. You're a little punk, man.

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:40.819
Yo, what's up?

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:45.324
Boy, you better get your butt back in
before your mama try to kill us all.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:48.076
- Hey, Ant, what you doing out here?
- Just kicking it.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.494
Yo, let me have a drink.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:51.830
Hey, no, man. No.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.957
Man, give the little nigga a drink.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:57.336
Man, what's wrong with you, Kevin?
Don't be giving this kid no liquor.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.005
- You ain't his daddy.
- You're not either, Kevin.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.465
Shit.

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:04.426
Anthony, what are you doing out here?
You know better.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.179
Come on. Let's make it.
Get in the house.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:10.390
And, Caine, can I speak to you
for a second?

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.143
It's about to rain out here.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.478
Pussywhipped.

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:18.023
She got that nigga in some panties, man.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:21.193
Take your juice and go to your room.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.861
Go on, boy.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:25.072
What up, babe?
What up, what up, what up?

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:26.406
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.617
- Come here, come here, come here.
- Chill.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.535
Chauncy, chill out, nigga.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.580
Oh, nigga. I'm just joking.
You know you're my nigga, Caine.

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.040
Yo, Ronnie.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.209
I'm gonna catch you later.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:40.712
Caine, me and you, baby.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:43.548
Cock-blocking motherfucker.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:51.181
Why haven't I heard from you?

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.933
I been busy.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:57.062
Well, have you at least thought
about what we talked about?

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.232
Yeah, about leaving with you?
Yeah, I thought about it.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.650
Why are you tripping?

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.527
You ain't doing jack shit here.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.405
Caine, why don't you just come with me?

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:08.532
Ain't nothing gonna change in Atlanta.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.076
I mean, I'm still gonna be black.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:13.370
Just another nigga from the ghetto.

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:16.540
Why do you say stupid shit like that?

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.583
Because it's true.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:21.420
I mean, you act
like Atlanta ain't in America.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.755
They don't give a fuck.

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:26.717
You know what?

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:32.597
You know what Anthony asked me
the other night?

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.435
He asked me if you were gonna die.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:39.187
If you were gonna die, Caine.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.447
Are you gonna come with us or not?

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.786
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:00.792
Hey, that's not cool, all right?

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.035
Let me guess, man.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:19.746
You was up in there
knocking it out?

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:22.290
Get out of my business, Stace.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.629
Me and A-Wax, Caine went to the Laker
game last night. Why you sweating me, girl?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.716
All night, motherfucker. Hold on.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:36.054
- Come here. I'm just fucking with you.
- Stop.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:38.557
- Okay. Let's not.
- Come here. I wanna talk to you.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.725
- About what?
- Let me get this dance.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.061
- No dancing. You're drunk.
- Come on, Ronnie.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:45.355
- I've been checking you out.
- I know.

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.357
That Caine be standing in my way.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.234
Sit down. You're drunk. No dancing.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:52.654
What's up with Chauncy
tonight, man? He over there tripping.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:56.700
Why you pulling my arm?
Are you crazy, Chauncy? Will you stop it!

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:00.620
- Dog, you strapped?
- You know it.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.080
Give me your gun.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.249
- What for?
- Give me the motherfucking gun.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.418
What you gonna do, Caine?

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.587
Man, what you need a gun for?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.506
I don't give a fuck
what you're asking. Get off me!

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:14.259
Man, come on.

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.887
- Fucking...!
- You crazy motherfucker!

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:20.056
Caine, stop it. It's not that serious!
Will you stop it?

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:21.433
You're going to kill him!

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:24.186
Get him off of him! Get him off of him!
Stop it!

01:15:24.604 --> 01:15:27.606
- Chill out, man!
- Fuck that nigga!

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:31.318
Anthony, get in your room!
Get in your room.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:34.446
Fuck that, man! Fuck him!

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.741
Fuck! Fuck him, man!

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.175
Yeah?

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:56.760
It's me.

01:15:56.928 --> 01:15:58.970
Ilena? What's up?

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.515
Caine.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.476
I'm pregnant.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.604
What?

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.148
I'm pregnant.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.817
What the fuck you telling me for?

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:17.113
What? What, so you're just
gonna dog me?

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.657
It ain't mine.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:23.119
Look, you're the only one I was with.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.580
Stop lying, all right?

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.958
Besides, I had the jimmy on extra tight.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.085
That don't mean nothing, Caine.

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.504
That mean it's not mine.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.673
Caine, so, what?

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.260
You man enough to take a life,
you ain't man enough to take care of one?

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.138
Look, I ain't got time for this, all right?

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:43.974
Peace.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:56.194
Damn, man. Hey, man, this motherfucker
on this team, he whooping this boy ass.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.029
Man, this is a good-ass fight.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:01.324
This is like Caine beating your ass
the other night, man.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.036
Yeah, nigga?

01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.124
I bet you Caine won't be laughing...

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:12.627
after the five-0 get a hold
of this motherfucking tape.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.713
You can bet that shit, nigga.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.799
Look, man. If this was Caine
whooping your ass on this TV...

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:20.427
Hey, nigga, fuck Caine, nigga.

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.513
Motherfucking Caine.
Don't talk to me about Caine.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:26.558
- Man, fuck you. That look like you.
- Punk-ass motherfucker.

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:30.145
If this was you on TV, you got
your ass whooped. I don't give a fuck.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:08.600
How you doing?

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.104
I'm fine. And you?

01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:15.065
Living.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.277
The baby?

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.157
He's fine.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:28.953
Let me talk to Caine.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.627
Ronnie.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:40.131
I love you.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.654
It's been a long time, Caine.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.574
How you doing, man?

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.328
How come you ain't never come
to see me?

01:19:10.996 --> 01:19:15.333
Man, I didn't want to see you
caged in like some fucking animal.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:17.752
Is that what you think?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.295
I'm an animal?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.757
No, man.

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:27.929
When I was growing up...

01:19:33.436 --> 01:19:35.687
you was like my dad, man.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:50.493
Your letters...

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.204
in the beginning...

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.708
it got me through, young bro.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.045
Away from my girl...

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:02.881
away from my baby...

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.549
away from you.

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.642
Go with Ronnie, Caine.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:17.228
Oh, man, that ain't even...

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:20.648
I know how she feels about you,
and that's cool.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:30.492
She's a good girl, man, you know?

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.580
I just want her to be happy.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.583
You take care of my son.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.673
I can't do shit for him in here.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.136
You teach him better
than I taught you, man.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.891
Teach him the way we grew up
was bullshit.

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:00.480
All right?

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:09.030
Give me some.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.229
Hey, nigga, give up the car right now.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.441
Look at your ass, scared straight.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:47.986
Nigga, I was just tripping with you.

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.406
Hey, I ain't got time
for this shit no more.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.575
What's wrong? Why you acting like a ho?

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.243
Where you just coming from?

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.662
- Went to the pen to see Pernell, man.
- For real?

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.998
That nigga get mad at you or what?

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:01.624
- He all right.
- Oh, cool.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:04.919
- That boy out there...
- Hey, which one of y'all is Caine?

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:06.963
Who is this fool, man?

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.840
Who want to know?

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.174
A friend, homey.

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:14.846
Homey, hey, I don't think you know me.

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:18.516
Check this out.
I'm Ilena's cousin, partner.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:21.811
She don't like the way
you've been dogging her and I don't either.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.607
We supposed to fight over a bitch?

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.943
I think you need to watch
who you calling a bitch, partner.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:31.362
I think you better watch
who the fuck you...

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.157
Go ahead, scrap that fool.

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:36.534
Rush him, nigga! Rush him!

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:39.203
Hell, you stomp. Yeah.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:41.998
Trying to come in my 'hood
and start all that shit.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.458
Stomp! Stomp!

01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:46.044
KayDee! KayDee!

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.545
Caine. Caine.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:50.882
Get your ass in the house.

01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:55.178
Punk motherfucker.

01:22:55.346 --> 01:22:58.264
Proverbs 22:10

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:01.809
Cast out the scorner
and the contention shall go out.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:06.064
Yea, strife and reproach shall cease.

01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:07.940
So, what you trying to say, Grandpa?

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.984
Son, you got to go.

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.404
I don't want you to remain
in our house another night.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.157
What y'all want me to do?

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:19.994
I want you out of here tonight.

01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:22.080
We're sorry, Caine.

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:24.457
Y'all not too sorry.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.417
I mean, y'all kicking me out.

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:28.252
I've done all I can do for you.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.171
We tried our best to raise you.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.090
But you're bad.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.550
I wasn't gonna tell y'all until later...

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:36.219
but in a couple of weeks...

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:38.596
I'm moving to Atlanta with Ronnie.

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:40.515
I mean, can I just stay until then?

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:43.434
I hope you're not gonna mess up
that girl's life, Caine.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:46.062
- Grandma, I'm not...
- Caine!

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:50.108
Now, I sincerely hope
you get your life together.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:52.860
Lord knows I do.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.949
But I cannot have you in my home
one more night.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.120
Grandma...

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.962
Fine.

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:31.190
The same day I was leaving...

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:34.193
O-Dog had told me the cops was looking
for us over that liquor store robbery.

01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:36.654
He didn't care, though.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.574
He just hid out
with different homeys each night.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:42.160
Doc dropped a dime
on Chauncy's punk-ass.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:45.121
O-Dog was gonna kill him
if he didn't get caught first.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:46.956
Man, I ain't going nowhere, man.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.626
And you'll be a silly motherfucker
if you leave with this broad, man.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:53.421
Straight up. I ain't bullshitting.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.264
Shit, Ronnie.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:06.934
Just you and Ant moving or you taking
the whole fucking house with you?

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:10.188
Can you just take the box to the car?
Thank you.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:18.863
- What's this for?
- So you can take it to the car.

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.741
I don't know
why y'all want me to help y'all move.

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:23.868
I ain't the one leaving.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.747
Sellout motherfucker.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.305
What seems to be your problem?

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:48.476
I was just thinking about...

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:50.645
saying goodbye to my grandparents.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:52.939
You haven't talked to them yet?

01:25:56.235 --> 01:26:00.196
Well, if you want to,
we can stop by there before we go.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:04.575
But can you take some of these bags
to the car, please?

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:07.328
You keep bossing me around,
I ain't going nowhere.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.372
You ain't going where?

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:15.878
Hey, coz, come on, man.

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.758
Look, I just don't want you to go out
and do something crazy.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:24.136
Don't worry about shit.
I'm gonna handle this nigga for you.

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:26.514
Yo, I got to handle my business.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:32.061
Stupid ass, quit looking out, nigga.
Just get in the car.

01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:37.441
What's up, homeys? Hey, let's go twist
this nigga's cap back, man.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.652
Let's go. Let's do this.

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:48.494
- Come on, dog.
- I ain't getting paid for this.

01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:52.623
- I ain't getting paid for this shit.
- Nobody's not getting paid, Kevin.

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.625
This nigger got a gang of shit in here.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.544
Okay, Kevin. Let's stop arguing.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.087
Bitch.

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:04.468
Fuck that. Fuck. Y'all niggers ready?

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:09.098
Fuck that. We got to break this nigga up
something real proper-like. Man, fuck it.

01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:22.320
Vroom, vroom, vroom. Bam!

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.698
I bought you a new Big Wheel.
You gonna hit me?

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.325
Just gonna crash into me?

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:35.166
Fucker.

01:27:41.214 --> 01:27:43.925
Caine. Caine.

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:47.136
Thought you was gonna help out.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:50.181
You lazy.

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.391
L-A-Z-Y, lazy.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:55.227
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:11.118
You're lazy. You know that, right?

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:15.039
I want some money for this, Caine,
for real.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.551
Yo, what's up now, partner?

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:42.984
Get down, Ronnie! Stay down!

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:13.264
Damn, Sharif.

01:29:13.974 --> 01:29:16.684
What the fuck happened, man?

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:32.116
Get off me. I gotta get Anthony. Get up!

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.621
Come on. Get some fucking help, nigga!

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.040
- Get going.
- My God. Caine.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:42.835
Get Anthony out of here. Get him out.

01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.795
Go get some fucking help, nigga!

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:48.466
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
- Get some fucking help!

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:51.927
Not my niggas.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:55.222
Come on. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:57.099
Get some fucking help! Shit!

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:59.268
Get the fuck out of here!

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:05.816
Oh, shit. It's okay. You're okay.

01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:08.319
Don't quit now, nigga.
Come on, come on.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:10.488
Fight. Fight.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:12.573
Come on. No.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:15.993
You're just fucking me up again, you know.
Come on, baby.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.871
After stomping Ilena's cousin like that...

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:22.249
I knew I was gonna have to deal
with that fool someday.

01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:23.959
Damn.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:27.088
I never thought he'd come back like this.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.006
Blasting.

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:31.133
Like I said...

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:33.969
it was funny like that
in the 'hood sometimes.

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:37.515
I mean, you never knew
what was gonna happen or when.

01:30:39.184 --> 01:30:41.936
I had done too much to turn back...

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:43.813
and I had done too much to go on.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.149
I guess in the end...

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.693
it all catches up with you.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.946
My grandpa asked me one time...

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:54.198
if I care whether I live or die.

01:30:56.368 --> 01:30:57.868
Yeah, I do.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:01.580
And now it's too late.

01:31:02.305 --> 01:31:08.902
