WEBVTT

00:09.313 --> 00:12.099
What I want to know is
how did my son die?

00:12.142 --> 00:14.840
Isaac was executed.
He was shot in the back of the head...

00:14.884 --> 00:16.277
No!

00:16.320 --> 00:17.602
During a failed escaped attempt.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.280
I know people

00:19.323 --> 00:20.605
- who can get us out of here, George.
- There's a total

00:20.629 --> 00:22.326
of 15 million here.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.721
33 payments were sanctioned
around the date that Miller

00:25.764 --> 00:27.070
was released. The first payments

00:27.114 --> 00:29.290
originated from a company here.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.380
The source of the ransom,
and it's this place?

00:32.423 --> 00:35.296
I've been accused of...

00:35.339 --> 00:37.167
of harassment.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.864
What's your take on Al Moctar?

00:38.908 --> 00:40.083
He's dedicated.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.085
He's smart.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.608
The air force...
That is my problem.

00:43.652 --> 00:44.957
I can help you with that.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.831
This is the long arm of KMPH.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.572
They infiltrated
the intelligence services

00:50.615 --> 00:51.964
to act on their behalf.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.705
I made a deal with Max Easton,

00:53.749 --> 00:56.206
- Harry Clarke's father.
- I don't care what you've got to do...

00:56.230 --> 00:58.058
Issue a warrant...
Just pick 'em up.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.327
Harry, what are we gonna do?

01:06.370 --> 01:08.503
What is he doing?

Dramatic footage
today posted online

02:11.261 --> 02:14.090
by Malian Separatists who have,
for the first time,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.092
shot down a government
air force fighter

02:16.136 --> 02:17.615
with a surface-to-air missile.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.704
Rebels can be heard yelling,
"Azawad," the name

02:19.748 --> 02:21.750
of the Northern Malian
territory, which they

02:21.793 --> 02:23.012
- claim is...
- Daddy?

02:23.055 --> 02:24.883
Morning, sweetheart.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.451
You hungry?
Want me to make you a waffle

02:27.495 --> 02:29.888
or some eggs or something?

02:31.455 --> 02:33.588
What is it?

02:35.416 --> 02:38.158
Are you and Mommy
getting divorced?

02:44.729 --> 02:46.644
Who told you that?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.473
Are you?

02:53.782 --> 02:55.653
Sit down.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.089
Hey.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.269
Everything's gonna be all right.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
No! No!

05:45.867 --> 05:48.217
- No! No!
- Shh! Shh!

05:48.260 --> 05:49.784
- No! No!
- Shh!

05:49.827 --> 05:52.613
Shh...

05:52.656 --> 05:54.223
No!

07:30.101 --> 07:32.060
No!

07:32.103 --> 07:33.801
No! No!

07:33.844 --> 07:35.890
No! No!

07:38.719 --> 07:39.937
No! No!

07:48.468 --> 07:49.860
No!

08:01.568 --> 08:02.873
Aicha!

08:05.006 --> 08:06.224
No, no, no, no, no!

08:59.930 --> 09:01.410
Leyla!

09:40.405 --> 09:43.278
The Americans are playing you.

09:51.547 --> 09:52.592
Who cares?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.115
You know what I did today?

09:56.204 --> 09:57.727
I declared our independence.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.382
Only because they let you.
Because it suits their purpose.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.260
There has been no assault
by American forces

10:09.304 --> 10:11.872
since you took this town,
am I right?

10:13.438 --> 10:15.758
Why do you think that is?

10:17.529 --> 10:19.575
Or...

10:19.619 --> 10:22.447
because it's in their interest
to let you hold it.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.366
How long after we left you
two years ago

10:28.410 --> 10:29.933
did you start receiving arms?

10:31.239 --> 10:32.457
And what did they give you?

10:32.501 --> 10:35.417
Let me guess... FIM 92s.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.681
The same missiles
they gave the Taliban

10:38.725 --> 10:40.552
to shoot down
Soviet helicopters.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.425
The difference is this time
it's not the CIA

10:43.468 --> 10:44.861
that's supplying the arms,

10:44.905 --> 10:46.820
it's a corporation

10:46.863 --> 10:49.126
called KMPH.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.393
You think I care
whose weapons I use?

10:55.437 --> 10:58.832
You're their patsy,
their errand boy.

10:58.875 --> 11:02.574
They built you up as an excuse
to bring in American troops,

11:02.618 --> 11:04.446
and when they
no longer need you,

11:04.489 --> 11:06.100
your supply of arms
will be switched off

11:06.143 --> 11:07.667
as soon as it was turned on.

11:11.845 --> 11:15.587
You give us your contact
who supplied the arms.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.722
We follow the trail
back to KMPH,

11:19.766 --> 11:21.681
get the truth out there.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.379
An American company profiting

11:24.422 --> 11:26.598
from dead American soldiers.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.992
That's something even this
White House can't ignore.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.908
Undermines their whole purpose
for being here.

11:31.952 --> 11:35.738
Maybe they draw down
their troops.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.871
Maybe they withdraw altogether.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.618
Yeah, well, I ran out of road.

12:04.506 --> 12:07.509
Hey, now, look, I never said
when they would cut you off.

12:07.552 --> 12:08.902
Only that they will.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.549
You will be hanging
from that scaffold out there.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.404
All of you.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.951
George?

12:59.126 --> 13:01.171
- George?
- Huh?

13:01.215 --> 13:03.217
Oh, sorry, sorry.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.696
Are you okay?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.698
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.831
Family okay?

13:08.875 --> 13:12.443
Uh, you said... it was urgent?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.663
Yes. Um...

13:14.706 --> 13:16.056
I need a favor.

13:16.099 --> 13:19.146
A subject in London.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.864
Malian opposition leader

13:21.888 --> 13:23.933
needs a bit of hand-holding.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.848
Take him to Kempton Park
or whatever it is

13:25.892 --> 13:28.329
- you usually do with them.
- Yambo Kanté.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.374
Why are we courting him?

13:30.418 --> 13:32.376
- Useful.
- What's he doing in the UK?

13:32.420 --> 13:34.161
Financial irregularities.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.859
You know how it works, George...
He's a potential asset.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.382
- We just need...
- We? Uh...

13:39.601 --> 13:42.778
Uh... who is "we"?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.433
Because I'm-I'm just
a little bit confused here.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.957
- Okay.
- We the U.S.,

13:48.001 --> 13:50.481
we the CIA or...

13:50.525 --> 13:53.484
we the Daughters
of the American Revolution?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.965
- Maybe just keep your voice down.
- Who paid the ransom?

13:56.009 --> 13:58.838
- Nathan didn't tell you?
- No.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.144
No, he didn't.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.755
You're alive.
Let's just be thankful.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.106
It wasn't aid money, was it?

14:07.237 --> 14:08.325
You need answers.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.631
This is not the moment.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.502
I was this close

14:11.546 --> 14:12.895
to getting a bullet.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.290
I don't have the capacity
to play games.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.901
- Let's just order.
- Where...

14:18.945 --> 14:22.383
did the money come from?

14:26.474 --> 14:27.954
18 words I know by heart.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.869
You'll know them, too, I'll bet.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.003
The assessed intelligence
has proved beyond doubt...

14:34.047 --> 14:36.092
That Saddam Hussein continues
in his efforts

14:36.136 --> 14:38.051
to create nuclear weapons.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.880
Doesn't it make you embarrassed?

14:40.923 --> 14:43.926
The system's cracking.
It's not fit for purpose.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.015
Overworked, undervalued.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.235
The intelligence service
is falling apart.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.759
- Hmm.
- 9/11,

14:50.802 --> 14:52.674
Afghanistan, New Delhi...

14:52.717 --> 14:55.416
The CIA missed all of them.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.374
Someone had to do something.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.857
Someone?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.990
I can sleep easy, I really can,

15:04.033 --> 15:07.384
knowing I don't have to rely
upon a broken-down machine.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.084
You have your own
intelligence capability.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.567
There's more than one way
to get things done around here.

15:20.789 --> 15:24.010
- Why am I here again?
- Charm offensive.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.056
- George White to see Mr. Kanté.
- Go straight inside.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.623
And you were there?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.103
No, no, not Magdalen.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.495
Trinity.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.715
What's your son studying?

15:33.758 --> 15:35.499
Economics.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.023
He has an accent now.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.547
Two years, and he talks
like an English prince.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.030
Couple of things
we need to iron out.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.032
Sure.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.121
More champagne?

15:52.864 --> 15:54.692
Thank you.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.044
Men's business.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.437
Yes, of course.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.533
Dan Lotz here to see
Yambo Kanté.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.405
Of course.
Go right through, sir.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.021
Gentlemen.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.114
You're going to have to do this

16:25.158 --> 16:26.202
in a courtroom.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.161
Get used to saying it out loud.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.206
Learn to be dispassionate.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.514
- I need to hear it from you, Gina.
- Yeah.

16:33.557 --> 16:36.256
Uh...

16:36.299 --> 16:38.954
her name is Lauren...

16:38.998 --> 16:41.739
Hansen. Uh...

16:41.783 --> 16:43.959
I see her at the gym sometimes.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.743
You've shared a changing room.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.572
You've been naked
in each other's presence.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.139
It was a gym, for Christ's sake.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.227
Meg.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.316
And what does she say happened?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.362
I marked her down,

16:55.405 --> 16:57.451
a couple of essays.
I told her that she needed

16:57.494 --> 16:59.559
to spend some extra time working
to get her grades back up.

16:59.583 --> 17:02.760
- Time with you?
- Well, obviously, you know, I-I didn't mean...

17:02.804 --> 17:04.719
You offered her
private coaching.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.808
I never intended...
You know, I-I didn't mean...

17:06.851 --> 17:09.897
- What exactly did you say to her?
- I said that we

17:09.941 --> 17:11.987
- should meet after class.
- So you invited her

17:12.031 --> 17:14.163
- to your home.
- No. Jesus!

17:14.207 --> 17:16.644
- I know the rules, you know. I'm not stupid.
- Gina.

17:16.686 --> 17:19.386
The letter says
that I came on to her.

17:19.429 --> 17:22.563
That is bullshit. There's no way
that that happened.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.913
And why would she lie about it?

17:26.393 --> 17:27.568
I don't know.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.615
You find anything?

17:31.659 --> 17:32.921
Yeah.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.010
The funeral store's owned by...

17:35.054 --> 17:37.534
Belcap International.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.189
They used the funeral home
as a write-off.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.497
And Belcap in turn
is owned by Seracom.

17:43.540 --> 17:46.152
- I know them.
- Big portfolio.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.284
Transport, health care,

17:48.328 --> 17:51.766
justice, hotels, security,
clothing... you name it.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.856
They even have a chain
of Christian bookshops.

17:54.899 --> 17:57.424
- Any government contracts?
- Yeah, a ton.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.861
But none of that linked to Mali

17:59.904 --> 18:02.211
or the CIA
or the Department of Defense

18:02.255 --> 18:04.257
or Nathan Miller.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.391
So why was Miller's ransom

18:08.435 --> 18:11.394
paid out of one of their assets?

18:11.438 --> 18:14.005
I don't know.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.051
It's a dead end.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.922
I'm sorry.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.583
Helen, could you
give us a minute?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.107
Sure.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.940
What happened?
You look terrible.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.770
Pack it up.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.121
- The desk?
- The whole thing.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.081
We're done.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.127
We're getting nowhere.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.564
Maybe there is nothing
to get to.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.132
I fucked my own career for this,

18:53.175 --> 18:54.698
my wife's career.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.483
What are you
talking about, Meaghan?

18:56.526 --> 18:58.572
Pack it up, all of it.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.443
They win.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.474
- General Kouyate.
- Military aircraft are bringing in equipment

19:31.518 --> 19:34.129
to fight Islamic militia
in North Africa.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.088
On the main airfield,
in the capital of Bamako,

19:37.132 --> 19:40.570
a huge operation is underway.
Meanwhile, the police

19:40.614 --> 19:43.834
are being stretched to breaking
point as civil unrest,

19:43.878 --> 19:46.446
riots and violent protests
continue

19:46.489 --> 19:50.101
throughout Bamako in opposition
to President Diabate's

19:50.145 --> 19:51.775
- failing regime.
- This is the tipping point.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.367
This administration
has lost control. It's time.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.848
I say when it's time.
Do I need to remind you?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.983
You're absolutely right,
General.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.898
My apologies.

20:05.334 --> 20:08.337
This is your show now.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.602
Yambo Kanté is on a flight
from London.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.518
It's time to welcome him home.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.266
Two miles from target.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.635
All cameras checked.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.617
Laser sensor check.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.402
We still have
two Hellfire missiles.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.794
Do you see it?

20:30.838 --> 20:32.361
That's a negative, sir.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.058
Not yet.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.026
Ma'am.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.109
Right over there.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.303
Colonel.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.306
We have a confirmed sighting
of Al Moctar.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.266
I just received the go
on a kill strike.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.374
Shh, shh!

21:37.513 --> 21:38.949
That him?

21:38.993 --> 21:40.995
We have confirmation

21:41.038 --> 21:42.431
from the source, sir.

21:42.475 --> 21:43.650
That is Al Moctar.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.351
Is that it?

21:49.395 --> 21:51.614
- That's it.
- Take out the target.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.096
Rifle, rifle, rifle,
weapon away.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.316
Cleared to engage.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.969
Engage now.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.798
Free in three, two...

22:04.627 --> 22:06.934
What the fuck just happened?

22:06.977 --> 22:09.328
We just lost signal, sir.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.286
- We've lost it.
- The connection?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.549
No, sir. The drone.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.900
- We've lost the drone, sir.
- What the fuck do you mean

22:16.944 --> 22:18.859
we lost the drone?
How did that happen?

22:19.947 --> 22:22.123
Their drone is destroyed, sir.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.129
Nice work.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.348
Thanks.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.459
That was too close. I thought
you were supposed to be

22:53.502 --> 22:55.983
- leading them away from Al Moctar.
- I was.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.854
It was third-party intel.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.595
We keep Al Moctar in play

22:59.639 --> 23:01.771
until the new president
is sworn in.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.643
I'm aware of the plan, Nate.

23:03.686 --> 23:06.776
Well, then I shouldn't have
to remind you of it, should I?

23:08.082 --> 23:10.040
What did Kingsley say?

23:13.174 --> 23:15.785
I'm seeing him again
this afternoon.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.439
What does that mean for me?

23:17.483 --> 23:19.267
I don't know.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.138
Amanda, honestly, I don't know.

23:48.775 --> 23:51.299
Mr. Weaver.

23:51.342 --> 23:52.735
You know horses, Miller?

23:52.779 --> 23:54.911
Well, my uncle used to have
a few on his farm, but

23:54.955 --> 23:56.522
they didn't look
anything like this,

23:56.565 --> 23:58.480
if that's what you're asking.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.874
Used them for breeding stock.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.311
The beginnings
of the modern dynasty.

24:03.354 --> 24:06.706
Bred for speed.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.577
Sir, did you talk to Kingsley?

24:09.883 --> 24:11.841
You think you'd be here
if I did?

24:12.973 --> 24:15.802
Mali's merely a prototype.
If this thing

24:15.845 --> 24:19.109
works there, we roll it out
across Africa.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.198
This is about the wars
we're gonna be fighting

24:21.242 --> 24:23.287
in ten, 20 years' time.

24:23.331 --> 24:26.552
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth?

24:28.075 --> 24:29.816
Well, the bill for Afghanistan

24:29.859 --> 24:32.906
is currently running
at $1.7 trillion.

24:32.949 --> 24:36.213
Now you multiply that
across a continent.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.956
So, given the stakes,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.002
I've decided to give you
a chance to put

24:42.045 --> 24:45.919
some flesh on the bones of that
audacious proposal of yours.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.226
Okay.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.274
Well...

24:55.581 --> 24:58.627
We mothball KMPH
until the scandal passes.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.890
We restructure
our corporate architecture,

25:00.934 --> 25:02.544
bury all of our assets,

25:02.588 --> 25:04.851
cauterize any possible link
to the boardroom.

25:04.894 --> 25:08.724
- You talking about a garage sale?
- No, sir, I'm not.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.248
We keep it all in the family.

25:11.292 --> 25:15.252
Munitions, construction,
support services.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.776
We bury all of our companies

25:16.819 --> 25:19.561
deep inside new holdings.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.129
And if that's not enough?

25:22.172 --> 25:25.001
We sell off any contracts
connected to the Mali operation

25:25.045 --> 25:28.222
to other companies of which you
were a non-executive director.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.441
That way, if this tape
does come out...

25:30.485 --> 25:33.836
If KMPH does go down...
The program is protected.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.577
It continues.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.883
What about Kingsley?

25:37.971 --> 25:40.451
Kingsley will survive, sir.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.453
There are so many scandals
these days,

25:42.497 --> 25:43.759
it's hard to tell them apart.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.326
The new normal.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.719
Exactly.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.592
And Amanda Jones?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.293
I think that she is still

25:56.337 --> 25:59.166
a valuable... asset to us

25:59.209 --> 26:01.037
inside the agency, sir.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.605
I think we should do everything
that we can to protect her.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.571
I'll be in touch.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.359
Fuck.

26:25.279 --> 26:29.109
Sole meunièreis good here.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.328
Brown butter and shrimps.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.595
I buried him.

26:39.162 --> 26:42.296
You see these,
uh, these blisters?

26:44.907 --> 26:45.987
They haven't really healed.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.305
Have you ever dug a grave

26:51.348 --> 26:53.960
in the sand, Marcus?

26:56.092 --> 26:57.790
I'm sorry, George.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.097
We did everything we could.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.230
Did you? Hmm.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.363
No one took it lightly.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.931
Well, that's good to hear.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.328
Because, for a while there,
it looked like

27:14.371 --> 27:16.635
you'd fucking well
forgotten all about us.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.115
Or I followed protocol.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.682
Things were taken
out of my hands.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.684
Oh, it was just
following orders.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.384
You've heard of shock, George.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.648
And it's understandable
that you're...

27:29.691 --> 27:31.171
What?

27:31.214 --> 27:33.042
Anxious?

27:33.086 --> 27:34.696
Depressed?

27:35.915 --> 27:38.744
An embarrassment?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.661
All right, I get it.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.752
Now, I know you're upset
about Thomas...

27:46.795 --> 27:48.057
Turner.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.454
His name is Isaac Turner.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718
- Sorry.
- Say it.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.198
- George.
- Say his name, Marcus.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.896
Just say his name.

28:00.940 --> 28:03.246
Isaac Turner.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.031
You were supposed
to have his back, Marcus.

28:05.074 --> 28:08.338
You were supposed to have
his fucking back!

28:11.820 --> 28:13.909
Enjoy your sole.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.827
Hey, George.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.612
You told me you can
sleep at night.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.137
Yes, that is what I said,
and I meant it.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.882
I'm in.

29:42.215 --> 29:45.218
Azawad! Azawad!

29:45.261 --> 29:47.786
General Kouyate, sir.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.664
Mr. President.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.972
I see you have a new shadow.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.061
Mr. President.

30:02.104 --> 30:04.454
This can't go on.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.587
Al Moctar is advancing
in the north.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.677
We are struggling to control
the streets here in Bamako.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.288
We continue the fight.

30:13.637 --> 30:17.250
I'm sorry
to have to inform you...

30:17.293 --> 30:20.993
you no longer have
the support of your generals.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.125
Then I will replace them.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.997
All of them.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.477
In that case, sir,

30:27.521 --> 30:30.524
I cannot guarantee your safety.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.224
The West...

30:35.268 --> 30:37.400
are happy to promote democracy

30:37.444 --> 30:41.056
until the leaders we elect
start thinking for ourselves.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.190
So, I ask you, what is my sin?

30:44.233 --> 30:47.846
That I did business
with Beijing and not Washington?

30:49.151 --> 30:52.154
We can offer you safe passage
out of the country, sir.

30:52.198 --> 30:55.288
If you leave now.

30:57.551 --> 31:00.946
Who have you chosen
to replace me?

31:33.456 --> 31:36.372
Why didn't you tell us
what happened to you?

31:36.416 --> 31:39.245
Would it have made a difference?

31:39.288 --> 31:42.117
He still would have
come back here.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
I'm sorry.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.869
Really?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.958
If that was true,

31:57.002 --> 31:59.178
we wouldn't be here.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.920
You'd be on a plane to England,
wouldn't you?

32:01.963 --> 32:05.358
And I'd be back home
with my brother and sister.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.157
Hey. Leyla.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.598
Do you think
they're going for the arms?

34:34.420 --> 34:35.638
Aicha, get in the car.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.042
Let her go!

34:50.043 --> 34:51.393
Let her go! Let her go!

34:58.748 --> 35:00.533
Harry, no!

35:00.576 --> 35:02.317
No!

35:56.893 --> 35:59.374
Senator, where are you going?

35:59.418 --> 36:01.507
You can't just walk in here.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.596
I'm sorry, Mr. Thompson.
I tried to stop her.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.685
It's all right, Sally.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.469
Why don't you, uh, take a seat.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.515
You represent Lauren Hansen,
who has filed

36:09.558 --> 36:11.299
what we both know
to be a baseless claim

36:11.343 --> 36:13.301
of harassment against my wife.

36:13.345 --> 36:17.000
Look, I'm... I'm not permitted
to discuss my client's matters

36:17.044 --> 36:19.220
with third parties. I'm sorry.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.980
- How much are they paying her?
- Excuse me?

36:21.004 --> 36:24.094
More to the point...
how much are they paying you?

36:24.138 --> 36:27.315
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Senator.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.360
Course you don't.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.583
Tell them
to call off their dogs.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.892
I'm throwing in the towel.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.895
They won't get any more trouble
from me.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.987
And tell that cunt
to go join another gym.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.169
Hey.

36:57.563 --> 37:01.393
- Smells good.
- Braised rabbit, marjoram and hazelnuts.

37:01.436 --> 37:03.003
Vintage?

37:03.046 --> 37:05.266
The complaint's been withdrawn.

37:08.008 --> 37:10.445
That's great news.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.665
Just like that, you know,

37:12.708 --> 37:15.189
the girl admitted
that she just made it up

37:15.233 --> 37:17.757
so she could get back at me
for marking her down.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.672
I didn't-I didn't
do anything, Meg.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.587
I know you didn't.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.115
I never doubted you.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.683
Yeah.

37:30.726 --> 37:33.163
Not for a moment.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.339
Thank you.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.170
Oh.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.696
Thank you for your support,

37:43.739 --> 37:45.828
for believing me...

37:47.830 --> 37:49.179
What is it?

37:51.051 --> 37:53.358
Oh, Gina.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.100
What?

37:59.451 --> 38:02.105
This was me.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.371
Uh, I don't understand.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.218
- What do you mean?
- I'm working on something.

38:08.242 --> 38:11.289
I can't go into details.
I was treading on some toes.

38:11.332 --> 38:14.030
This was their way
of warning me to back off.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.468
- Jesus.
- I told them I'd drop it.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.880
That's why the complaint
was withdrawn.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.384
W-Who?

38:19.427 --> 38:22.256
- I can't tell you that.
- But you-you can't...

38:22.300 --> 38:24.389
you-you can't cave.
You can't back down.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.869
It's done. Wasn't gonna see them

38:26.913 --> 38:28.393
destroy your career.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.748
You did that for me?

38:38.925 --> 38:41.144
Course.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.105
There was never any doubt.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.455
I love you so much.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.327
You know that?

39:02.688 --> 39:05.778
So, I thought it was time

39:05.821 --> 39:09.477
to move out of that hotel
and get my own place.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.479
Hey, this is mine.

39:11.523 --> 39:13.089
Come over here.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.700
Guess what's down here.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.092
Your room,

39:16.136 --> 39:18.181
for whenever
you stay over with me.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.531
Okay.

39:24.013 --> 39:26.015
Voilà.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.583
I tried to make it
like your room at home.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.151
But it isn't home.

39:41.857 --> 39:45.208
I'm doing the best
that I can, Katie.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.646
I know you are, Daddy.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.307
I've got to take this.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.397
It's okay.

40:23.769 --> 40:27.337
I'm gonna go ahead
with your recommendations.

40:27.381 --> 40:30.036
Neutralize
the threat of the tape.

40:32.604 --> 40:34.693
Kingsley's out.

40:37.043 --> 40:39.915
And what about Amanda Jones?

40:42.657 --> 40:45.355
Next time we speak, you're gonna
tell me that Harry Clarke

40:45.399 --> 40:47.706
and Leyla Toumi
have been dealt with.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.500
There's someone here
to see you, sir.

40:59.544 --> 41:00.719
In the study.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.461
Mm. Thank you, Maggie.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.957
Hope you don't mind.

41:22.001 --> 41:24.003
The maid let me in.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.615
Charming woman.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.664
What's this, late 1800s?

41:32.707 --> 41:34.796
1880.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.714
My wife found it.

41:39.758 --> 41:41.847
In Holt, Norfolk.

41:43.762 --> 41:44.763
In England.

41:47.069 --> 41:50.203
I have great affection
for you, William.

41:50.246 --> 41:52.510
So I'm gonna be honest with you.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.904
Okay.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.342
I know you lied.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.475
About Tehran.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.955
Oh, Hal...

42:02.998 --> 42:06.393
And I know about
the Collins tape.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.573
Hell, why didn't you come to me?

42:12.617 --> 42:14.575
20 years, we've worked together.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.012
21.

42:19.232 --> 42:22.322
I was ashamed.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.672
Of being played.

42:26.544 --> 42:29.242
There'll be an investigation.

42:29.285 --> 42:32.375
Of course,
we'll cloak our assets,

42:32.419 --> 42:35.509
make sure the Mali operation
isn't affected,

42:35.553 --> 42:37.119
as far as possible.

42:38.207 --> 42:39.644
But...

42:41.210 --> 42:43.082
we'll have to offer you up.

42:46.041 --> 42:49.305
You might have to do
a little time.

42:49.349 --> 42:52.439
Now, I'm gonna make that
as comfortable as I can.

42:52.482 --> 42:53.962
And you keep to the script,

42:54.006 --> 42:57.009
there's gonna be a respectable
nest egg waiting for you

42:57.052 --> 42:58.358
when you come out.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.882
Who was it?

43:00.926 --> 43:02.754
Miller?

43:06.453 --> 43:09.978
Ungrateful son of a bitch.

43:10.022 --> 43:12.590
You leave Miller alone,
you hear?

43:12.633 --> 43:14.722
Otherwise you're gonna
find yourself

43:14.766 --> 43:17.246
without any friends.

43:46.711 --> 43:49.365
There's been a
coup in the capital.

43:56.590 --> 43:59.288
Yambo Kanté, puppet of the West.

44:03.641 --> 44:06.165
Be my guess...

44:07.732 --> 44:09.385
They'll wait for him
to be sworn in

44:09.429 --> 44:11.736
and then they'll come for you.

44:15.957 --> 44:17.655
Offer up your head
for the new president.

44:30.058 --> 44:31.973
Look at them.

44:32.017 --> 44:34.497
They're itching
for the Americans to arrive.

45:03.744 --> 45:05.137
What will you do?

45:40.259 --> 45:42.348
Issouf...

45:45.307 --> 45:48.136
who was your contact
for the arms deal?

45:56.710 --> 45:59.278
I will not bow
before imperialism

45:59.321 --> 46:01.106
and colonialism.

46:01.149 --> 46:04.283
I will restore the dignity
of Malian people.

46:04.326 --> 46:06.938
I will defend
the territorial integrity

46:06.981 --> 46:08.766
of our country.

46:08.809 --> 46:11.638
And I alone can do that.

46:11.681 --> 46:13.596
The election will take place

46:13.640 --> 46:15.903
as soon as the situation

46:15.947 --> 46:18.036
has settled down in the country.

46:18.079 --> 46:21.474
Meanwhile, I will hunt down
Issouf Al Moctar.

46:21.517 --> 46:24.694
- People of Mali...
- Our troops are on the move to Temera.

46:24.738 --> 46:26.827
You can see it in their eyes.

46:26.871 --> 46:28.631
The moment he's sworn in,
you can begin your strike

46:28.655 --> 46:30.396
on Al Moctar's forces.

46:33.965 --> 46:36.097
Issouf Al Moctar

46:36.141 --> 46:37.925
will be brought to justice.

46:40.275 --> 46:43.104
You can see it in their eyes.
I...

46:43.148 --> 46:45.237
There's too many.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.804
What?

46:46.847 --> 46:48.240
Birds of North America.

46:48.283 --> 46:50.155
I'm supposed
to do a project on them,

46:50.198 --> 46:52.331
but there's just too many.

46:52.374 --> 46:54.507
Well, you know how

46:54.550 --> 46:56.204
- we're gonna do this?
- How?

46:57.597 --> 46:59.599
Bird by bird.

46:59.642 --> 47:01.098
What's your favorite color?

47:01.122 --> 47:02.515
Mm... green.

47:02.558 --> 47:04.256
Green.

47:04.299 --> 47:05.953
Oh-ho-ho-ho. Okay.

47:05.997 --> 47:07.825
Uh...

47:07.868 --> 47:10.523
give me a green bird.

47:14.744 --> 47:16.616
This is who I dealt with.

47:18.052 --> 47:19.932
South African.

47:21.403 --> 47:22.840
Didn't know his name.

47:27.235 --> 47:29.542
Musa was the name we used
for deliveries.

47:31.674 --> 47:33.198
Here's where you can find him.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.725
What about you?

47:43.861 --> 47:46.515
We're going to the desert.

47:46.559 --> 47:48.866
Live to fight another day.

47:55.089 --> 47:57.265
Our time will come.

48:50.971 --> 48:53.669
We'll be sure to keep
an eye on your selected stocks.

48:53.713 --> 48:55.497
Breaking news concerning

48:55.541 --> 48:58.283
Kingsley, Merchant, Proctor,
Hall... one of America's

48:58.326 --> 49:01.547
biggest companies. Now,
over to Karen. And in a move

49:01.590 --> 49:03.375
that took analysts by surprise,

49:03.418 --> 49:05.725
KMPH is selling
service contracts

49:05.768 --> 49:08.075
to provide
U.S. military with meals

49:08.119 --> 49:10.295
during the current
military operation in Mali

49:10.338 --> 49:12.079
to its rival, Seracom.

49:20.044 --> 49:21.306
Hey.

49:21.349 --> 49:23.047
You still have those boxes?

49:24.265 --> 49:26.137
Yeah, they're right here.

49:30.576 --> 49:32.621
Seracom paid Miller's ransom,

49:32.665 --> 49:34.275
- right?
- Right.

49:34.319 --> 49:37.713
Well... I just found
a link between them

49:37.757 --> 49:40.020
and our military operations
in Mali.

49:41.674 --> 49:44.329
Unpack those boxes.
This isn't over.
