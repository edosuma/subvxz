WEBVTT

00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
- I have a four-year-old.
- Aww.

00:16.999 --> 00:17.999
- We've never met
a real grown-up.

00:17.999 --> 00:20.999
- Saw, um, Miss Stassi
the other night.

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
- Our engagement party's
coming up,

00:21.999 --> 00:24.000
and I would love
for you to come.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- I'm hoping to actually
talk to her

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
at some point before then.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
- Her and Kristen
really want both of us

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
to go to Palm Springs.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
- Look, I've been going
through a really hard time,

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
and I take it out
through alcohol.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
- The worst thing is
for somebody to drink

00:37.000 --> 00:38.999
when they're in a bad place.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
- We understand that you
turned up loaded.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
- Kristen showed up too.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- I cannot have you
in Pump.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.999
I want you to go back to bussing
tables three days a week.

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- Stop making everybody
look like sháá

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
because you're too much
of a pussy

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
to admit to your
fáááing wrongdoings.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- I'm not wrong.
- Oh, fááá you, man.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
- I've been pretending like
I've been having a good time

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
around you guys
for a long time.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
So for a party of six or more,

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
we just need a credit card
to put on file.

01:36.999 --> 01:38.999
- ♪ It's time to break away ♪

01:38.999 --> 01:40.999
- Okay, thanks.
- Hi.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.999
- Hi, ladies.
- Is Lisa around?

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
- I haven't seen her.
No, I don't think she's here.

01:45.999 --> 01:47.999
- If you see her,
can you let her know in a hurry?

01:47.999 --> 01:48.999
- We need some money.
- I would love to.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.999
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

01:50.999 --> 01:53.999
- There's one day that is
the best day to be at Sur.

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
I mean,
better than a Saturday night.

01:55.999 --> 01:59.999
Better than a private event,
and that is payday.

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
It's been a rough couple days.

02:01.999 --> 02:03.999
- No, I just want
to get out of town.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.999
Seriously.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
When I went home this morning,
Tom was there,

02:07.999 --> 02:09.999
and he just started
shaking his head at me.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
After the beach,
we go to dinner,

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
and we'd been drinking,

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
and I was upset with Ariana
because she mentioned

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
that she's just been pretending
to have fun with us.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.000
- I'm mortified and embarrassed.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I go to the dark side
sometimes.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.999
Tom started blaming me
for the things that she said.

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
And I had no fáááing patience
for it at the end of the day,

02:27.999 --> 02:28.999
and I lost it on him.

02:28.999 --> 02:29.999
But I took it way too far

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
and should not have said
those mean things.

02:31.999 --> 02:35.999
I was drunk and just sending
these text messages.

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
I just said things like,
"Thank God I'm not pregnant.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.999
I can't believe
I almost married you."

02:39.999 --> 02:42.999
I just wanted to be mean
because I was hurt.

02:42.999 --> 02:44.000
- I mean, when I was looking
at the things

02:44.000 --> 02:45.999
you were sending him,
I was just like,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.999
"Katie, stop."
And you were like, "No.

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
I need to tell him
I'm giving him the ring back."

02:48.999 --> 02:51.999
And I was like, "No, no, don't--
don't say that, don't say that."

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
- Well, I mean, that's how
Tequila Katie felt about it.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.999
When Tequila Katie's pissed,
it's not normal,

02:55.999 --> 02:57.999
but it's, like,
end of the world pissed.

02:57.999 --> 03:01.999
My own boyfriend is sticking up
for the whore in there.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
I'll just apologize for it,
and we can talk about it.

03:03.999 --> 03:06.999
But right now, like,
he doesn't want to talk to me.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
- Hi.
- Do you guys know

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
if Lisa's here yet?
- We're waiting.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
- No, she's not here yet.
- Oh.

03:12.999 --> 03:15.999
- I thought your shoes were her.
- All right, well...

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
if Lisa's not here yet,

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
just try to figure out
how to get my check.

03:19.999 --> 03:22.999
- You can try the office.
We didn't go up there yet.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
- All right, I'll try.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.999
- Like, that's what
I'm getting so tired of,

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
the condescending attitude,

03:30.999 --> 03:32.999
and just, like, the iciness
that comes from it,

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
and just--oh, God.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
- Hello, girls.
- Hi.

03:38.999 --> 03:41.999
- We've been waiting for you.
- You're waiting for me?

03:41.999 --> 03:42.999
- Yeah.
- What are you waiting for?

03:42.999 --> 03:44.999
- Our paychecks.
- We need some money.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999
- That's all you want me for
is money.

03:46.999 --> 03:47.999
- Yes.
- I don't actually have it.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
- So you're not working tonight?
- No.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
- Our shifts are covered.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
- We're kind of making
a surprise.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.000
- Making a surprise what?

03:55.999 --> 03:57.999
- Well, we were invited
by Kristen.

03:57.999 --> 04:00.999
- Oh, that doesn't sound
like a good invitation.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
- We're doing a girls'
Palm Springs trip.

04:01.999 --> 04:04.999
And Stassi's gonna be there.

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
- Hold on a second.
You're gonna go to Stassi

04:06.999 --> 04:07.999
all the way down
to Palm Springs?

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- I want to catch her
off guard.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
I don't want her
to be preparing a speech.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
I kind of want to just, like,
go to Palm Springs

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
and just knock on her door.

04:14.999 --> 04:16.999
- Oh, my God, the look
on her face would be priceless.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
- The less she is prepared
for it,

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
the more authentic
I will see from her.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
- Yeah, I think so.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
- I don't want you to go back

04:23.999 --> 04:26.999
to being deferential to her,
and you know what I mean.

04:26.999 --> 04:27.999
I just don't want
to see you hurt.

04:27.999 --> 04:29.999
- Lisa does not need to worry
about me

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
standing my ground with Stassi.

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
That's all I have been doing
for the last year.

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
Believe me, no one is gonna
be tougher on her than I am.

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
- Yeah, go see her.

04:37.999 --> 04:40.999
If you want my advice,
hold your ground,

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
but keep your heart open.

04:41.999 --> 04:43.999
- That's my plan, exactly.
- Good luck.

04:43.999 --> 04:44.999
- Thank you.
- All right, bye.

04:44.999 --> 04:45.999
Drive safely.
- Thank you.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.999
- Let's hit the road, bitch.
- All right.

04:57.999 --> 04:58.999
- Hey, you guys,

04:58.999 --> 05:01.999
I got some rum or some tequila
if you want some.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
- Whoa, we got to babysit.
- That depends.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
- I think I'm gonna need this.
- How old is Liam again?

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
- He's four.
- And how tired is he?

05:07.999 --> 05:09.999
- He's probably gonna
be excited.

05:09.999 --> 05:10.999
- All right, cool.
Give me some shots.

05:10.999 --> 05:12.999
- Buzzed babysitting.
- I'm excited.

05:12.999 --> 05:13.999
Like, this is gonna be
kind of fun.

05:13.999 --> 05:16.999
- Dude, three men and a baby.
- Three men and a baby.

05:16.999 --> 05:17.999
Thanks.
- Thanks, Peter.

05:17.999 --> 05:18.999
- Here you go.
- Dude, thank you, man.

05:18.999 --> 05:19.999
- Yeah, of course.

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
I've never dated a woman
with a kid before.

05:21.999 --> 05:22.999
But I know my girlfriend
can trust me.

05:22.999 --> 05:25.999
- You look like a pirate.
- Ahh!

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
I don't know--I don't--
- I win.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
- Honestly I don't think
that we're gonna do anything

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
remotely stupid.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
- So yesterday was fun, huh?
- Hell, yeah, it was.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
- It was really fun, but it--
- I mean it got--you know,

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
I got into
some serious conversation.

05:41.999 --> 05:45.999
Am I happy with who I am?
Am I happy with where I am?

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
- Well, are you happy
with who you are?

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
- I don't know.
I got to figure it out.

05:48.999 --> 05:49.999
I don't want to say
it's a midlife crisis

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
although I am
at the age almost

05:51.999 --> 05:53.999
where I have to start thinking
about stuff like that,

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
but everyone goes through
their ups and downs.

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
- You saw at dinner last night,
after the beach at dinner.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
- I know, I did see it.
- Did you see how fast

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
that escalated?

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
I started trying to justify
a little bit Ariana's behavior,

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
more just trying to see
where she came from.

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
Katie just lost it.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.999
She spun a story so much
to fit her narrative.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
And I just, like, snapped
in that moment.

06:09.999 --> 06:10.999
I told her
that's a scumbag move.

06:10.999 --> 06:14.999
From there on out, she was
rage-texting me for four hours.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
The bubble never stopped
for one second.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
She starts with the,
"You're a piece of sháá.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.999
You're not a good boyfriend."
Then it started escalating to,

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
"Thank God
I'm not pregnant.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.000
"Fááá, I can't believe
I almost married you.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
I can't even believe
I considered you as a fiancé."

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
Like, "I want all your sháá
out of the apartment."

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
She's like, "I don't give
a fááá about this ring."

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
Even though when it's happening,
I know--

06:31.999 --> 06:34.999
I know it's the alcohol,
and I know it's just blind rage,

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
but it still hurts
to hear that.

06:35.999 --> 06:38.000
Katie's like the Shakespeare
of rage-texting.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
I mean, it's a brutal poetry.

06:40.999 --> 06:44.999
And sometimes the words,
you know, they really hit home.

06:44.999 --> 06:46.999
- Uh-oh.

06:46.999 --> 06:47.999
Let's do a cheers real quick.
- Yeah.

06:47.999 --> 06:50.999
- Get a little heated.

06:50.999 --> 06:51.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
- How you doing?
- Oh!

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
There's the most handsome guy
in the world.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
- Liam.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
- Who's gonna be the princess?

06:59.999 --> 07:00.999
- Who's gonna be
the princess?

07:00.999 --> 07:01.999
- He plays--here.
- It'll be me.

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
- He plays princess and monster.
- Uh-oh.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- It's a role I know well,
unfortunately.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
- He does. Uh-oh.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
- Thank you so much
for watching him

07:09.999 --> 07:12.999
'cause my babysitter canceled
really last-minute.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
I have to go to these meetings
with my sister.

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
Thank you so much.
- Yeah, we got this.

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
- And I just--
I wrote down some rules.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- Ah, there's rules.
- Rules?

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- I mean, it's not like
a big deal.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
I just, like, wrote them down.
- He doesn't do well with rules.

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
- Oh, my God.
Is that page one of five?

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
- It's just one.
- Is it bullet points?

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- No candy, 'cause he just--
he gets, like, crazy.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, I wrote them in, like,

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
bold just so
you don't forget.

07:33.999 --> 07:34.999
- If we do go out,
should we just, like,

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
put him in a cage
with a little water bowl?

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
- No.
- Maybe I invited

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
the wrong two people
to help me out.

07:39.999 --> 07:40.999
- We'll be good.
- Bye, Ma.

07:40.999 --> 07:43.999
- All right, keep him alive.

07:43.999 --> 07:46.000
- I'm sorry, but anything
that happens to this kid,

07:46.999 --> 07:47.999
that's on Sarah.

07:47.999 --> 07:48.999
I mean, she never should have
trusted us.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
Your mom's gone, that means
you can do whatever you want.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
- You can do
whatever you want.

07:51.999 --> 07:54.999
- The rules do not apply
once you walk out that door.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.999
- Liam, so...
I got a bunch of stuff for you.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.000
- Oh!
- You like toys?

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
- Yeah.
- Shoot him!

08:02.999 --> 08:04.999
Oh!

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
- I got him!
- Whoa.

08:06.999 --> 08:07.999
- I'm realizing
babysitting's awesome

08:08.000 --> 08:10.999
because more or less,
your job is to be a kid again.

08:10.999 --> 08:14.999
More toys, more toys,
more toys.

08:14.999 --> 08:15.999
- Here, let's draw Mommy.
- Guys, come on now.

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
- They're Mommy's boobs.
- Those aren't Mommy's boobs.

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
Did you say that?
- No.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
- No.

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- I mean,
we're playing Zombie Slayer.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
I'm the zombie princess.
We're building forts.

08:25.999 --> 08:29.999
- I'm hungry, I'm hungry.
I want some too.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.000
- Don't tell Mom.
- Okay.

08:31.999 --> 08:32.999
- We're eating candy.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
- Want a peanut butter cup?
- She was just joking.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
- Oh, she was?

08:36.999 --> 08:37.999
- Yeah, I used to say
the same thing.

08:37.999 --> 08:40.999
- She gave me a list of rules.
- Yeah, she was just jo--

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
This is an awesome lesson
for Liam on how to be a man.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
You do whatever the hell
you want,

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
but you make sure
that you never tell the woman

08:46.999 --> 08:47.999
what you're actually doing.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.999
- Whoa!

08:59.999 --> 09:01.999
- Yeah.
- Whoo-hoo.

09:01.999 --> 09:06.999
Freaking finally.
Let's do this.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.999
- Do you need anything
back here?

09:10.999 --> 09:12.999
- Okay.
- It's really hot.

09:12.999 --> 09:14.999
- I have a bottle of vodka
in my goddamn--

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
- You are carrying
two paper bags.

09:16.999 --> 09:19.999
- We have such a strong team
in Palm Springs.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
Me, Rachael, Stassi, vodka.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
This is Rachael's parents'
vacation house

09:23.999 --> 09:24.999
and they're not here.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
So we're gonna act like
a bunch of teenagers

09:26.999 --> 09:27.999
with no parents.

09:27.999 --> 09:30.999
Stassi, there's your bed.
- Oh, my God.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
Can this be the new place
where I squat?

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
- We should really come here
more often.

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
- Katie and Scheana
are gonna be really upset...

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
- Yeah, they're gonna be mad
they didn't come.

09:38.999 --> 09:39.999
This is gonna be so fun.
- When I take all these awesome

09:39.999 --> 09:40.999
photos and they're gonna be
like, "Fááá.

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
We should have came."

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
- Can we go sit outside?

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
It's really upsetting
that Katie and Scheana

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
didn't want to come
to Palm Springs

09:47.999 --> 09:48.999
because I used to be the one
who, like,

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
decided who was going
on a trip or not.

09:51.999 --> 09:52.999
Now I'm the one that people

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
will literally stay home
to avoid.

09:54.999 --> 09:57.999
- This is heaven on Earth.

09:57.999 --> 10:01.999
- Who would be here?

10:01.999 --> 10:03.000
- Surprise.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- Cheers.
- Thank you so much--

10:15.999 --> 10:18.999
- #wildweekend.
- Thank you guys for coming.

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, three wild girls.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
- It's gonna be so wild.
- I think it's only about,

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
like, 102 right now.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.999
- Oh, no big deal.
Just 102 and bugs.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
- I'm so happy you guys came.

10:29.999 --> 10:33.999
- I had no idea Palm Springs
would be so hot and jungly.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.999
It's like the devil
just sháá me out

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
into this weird, like,
Mars planet

10:37.999 --> 10:40.999
where there's palm trees
and old people

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
in this desert
unbearable heat.

10:42.999 --> 10:44.999
- That's an aggressive lighter
for a cigarette.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
- I know. That's right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
- She's lighting hard.
- I know, I'm sorry.

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
I know you guys don't like it.
I'm sorry.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.000
Literally, I'm so, so sorry.

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
And now James has literally
been blowing

10:51.999 --> 10:54.999
my fáááing phone up.

10:54.999 --> 10:57.999
- What is he saying to you
that's making you so upset?

10:57.999 --> 10:59.999
- James brought a girl
to the Malibu beach party

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
who no one knows.

11:01.999 --> 11:05.999
- This is Laurel, Scheana.
Scheana, Laurel.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.999
- Block him, yeah.
- No more James.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- I mean, this is
beyond Kristen, like,

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
being into bad boys.

11:11.999 --> 11:13.999
This is Kristen
being into losers now.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.999
- Block.
- You're too old for this.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
Not in a mean way.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
- That's great.

11:28.999 --> 11:32.999
Okay, so we will see you
tonight at 10:30.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.999
You're so welcome.
Bye-bye.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.999
Hi, James.
- Hi, gorgeous, what's up?

11:38.999 --> 11:41.999
- What was up
with the random basic yesterday?

11:41.999 --> 11:43.999
- Laurel?
She's not a random basic.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
I've known her
for a little while.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
We're just hanging out.
- What's the motive, James?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
Come on.
- What are you trying to say?

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
- I know that she wouldn't
be around making me jealous.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
And there's only
one other person

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
that you'd be trying
to make jealous.

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
- Well, I didn't know if
you were gonna bring someone

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
and Kristen was gonna
bring someone,

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
and then I'm just that loser
that showed up

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
to the beach alone
who just lost his job, like...

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
- What is up with you, man?

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
James is in this place
where he, like,

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
wants to make
me and Kristen jealous.

12:06.999 --> 12:10.999
I keep asking myself what kind
of grown-ass man would do that,

12:10.999 --> 12:13.999
but then I remember
James is still a little boy.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.999
Instead of being the DJ
that he wants to be,

12:17.999 --> 12:20.000
he's fáááing bussing tables.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
Truthfully,
even when you and I were,

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
you know, doing whatever
we were doing, messing around...

12:24.999 --> 12:26.999
- Yeah.
- I still didn't feel like

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
you were 100% over Kristen.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.999
Cut the little boy sháá,
take the bitch to dinner,

12:31.999 --> 12:34.999
and discuss how you feel
about her.

12:34.999 --> 12:35.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:35.999 --> 12:38.999
- I guess so.
- All right, there we go.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.999
We're gonna be adults.
We're gonna be grown-ups now.

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
Take the bitch to dinner.
- Ooh.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
- And cry on her shoulder
or something.

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
- Oh.
- I'm going back to work.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.999
- Lala, killing it.
- Have a good day.

12:48.999 --> 12:49.999
- Killing the game.

12:58.999 --> 13:01.999
- What's up, man?
- What's the story?

13:01.999 --> 13:02.999
- Oh, I've just been busy, man.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
I had a photo shoot
the other day.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.999
I'm also executive producing
my music video.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
It's been a lot.

13:09.999 --> 13:10.999
- Everyone thinks you guys
are kind of, like,

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
separating yourself
from one another.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.999
- I haven't really done
anything

13:15.999 --> 13:18.999
to separate myself
from anyone.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.999
- You don't think so?

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
- I don't know, man.
- What? Say what's on your mind.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
- I feel like I've gone
out of my way

13:26.999 --> 13:27.999
to be a good friend,
and lately,

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
all you've been kind of doing
is taking opportunities

13:30.999 --> 13:33.999
to sort of, like--like,
knock my character.

13:33.999 --> 13:34.999
- I don't even talk about you.
- You don't--

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
- I honestly don't even
bring your name up.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
- Rachael and Kristen
specifically said,

13:39.999 --> 13:43.999
"Jax just told me that you guys
were making fun of us."

13:44.000 --> 13:45.999
- We were talking about
your sketch comedy

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
before you got here, and then
when Ariana got involved,

13:47.999 --> 13:50.999
she was like, "All of a sudden,
she's a sketch artist?"

13:50.999 --> 13:51.999
She's like, "I'm sorry,
I've been trained in sketch.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.999
I take that sháá
really seriously."

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
I feel like Tom and Ariana live
on their own goddamn planet.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.999
- You go run
and tell somebody something

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
and blow it out
of proportion and exaggerate,

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
and, like, purposely try
to make me look bad

14:02.999 --> 14:05.999
and put me in
an uncomfortable position.

14:05.999 --> 14:09.999
I'm genuinely happy when I hear
about my friends doing stuff

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
and making moves,
but Jax, I mean,

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
he--he gets, like,
threatened

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
if he's not getting
that attention

14:15.999 --> 14:16.999
that he so desperately wants.

14:16.999 --> 14:19.999
It's like he has
to stir sháá up.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.000
Why don't you fáááing stick up
for your friend,

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
and not throw me under the bus?

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
- I'm not throwing you
under the bus personally.

14:24.999 --> 14:27.999
- I don't get attention
off the expense of other people.

14:27.999 --> 14:30.999
- The beach day was all about
your girlfriend, not you.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
Instead of being so negative
all day--

14:32.999 --> 14:34.999
- I'm not negative, homie.
I'm not negative, dude.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.999
- Ariana does bring a little
negativity towards Tom.

14:37.999 --> 14:39.999
And I think it makes Tom
be more negative.

14:39.999 --> 14:41.999
And I hate to say this,

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
but I think Tom was more fun
when he was dating Kristen.

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
- There's a totem pole here,
okay?

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
For me and Ariana,
your consideration

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
towards our feelings
and how we feel about anything

14:49.999 --> 14:52.000
is way down here
at the very bottom.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
It would just be nice
if I got a little reciprocation

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
as a friend, that's all.

15:02.999 --> 15:05.999
- ♪ I know you'll see me
on the come around ♪

15:05.999 --> 15:06.999
♪ Come around ♪

15:06.999 --> 15:09.999
♪ If you try a little harder ♪

15:09.999 --> 15:11.999
♪ You can feel it on... ♪

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- Malibu was honestly the sháá.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
Like, it was such
a gorgeous day.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
Faith was there,
she was super sweet.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
Max was there with his, like,
40-year-old girlfriend.

15:19.999 --> 15:20.999
But my thing was, like,

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
I just wanted to hang out
with Rachael and Katie

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
and Scheana and Jax.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
And it was just, like, fun

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
because we were there
for Tom and Katie.

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
- Okay, I've been listening
to the fact

15:29.999 --> 15:32.999
that Katie and Tom are, like,
doing all these things,

15:32.999 --> 15:36.999
and I'm literally the only one
that's not even welcome

15:36.999 --> 15:39.999
to send, like,
even a fáááing emoji

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
to either of their phones,
it feels like.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.999
So it's just really frustrating.
- It's not fair.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
- It's like, "Fááá!"
I feel like every week

15:46.999 --> 15:49.999
there's something big
that's happening in Katie's life

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
and I'm just missing it.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
I need a seriously
strong drink.

15:52.999 --> 15:56.999
It feels like you miss enough
of these big life events

15:56.999 --> 16:00.999
to where you realize
you're no longer a friend.

16:00.999 --> 16:03.999
Oh, my God.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.999
My heart's, like, pounding.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
- Are you sure
you still want to do this?

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
- Yeah, no, no, I-I do,
but it's just like this whole,

16:09.999 --> 16:13.999
like, this--the whole surprise
element of just whatever

16:13.999 --> 16:18.000
is like...

16:18.999 --> 16:20.999
- I'll let you do the honors.
- I don't want to do nothing.

16:20.999 --> 16:22.999
I know, but...

16:27.999 --> 16:31.999
This is so weird.
So weird. Ready?

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
- Yeah, that's messed up.

16:33.999 --> 16:37.999
- Off.
- Who would be here?

16:37.999 --> 16:41.999
- I ordered male strippers.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
- This isn't a chance for me
to tell Stassi

16:43.999 --> 16:45.999
everything that
she's done wrong.

16:45.999 --> 16:46.999
This is Stassi's chance
to tell me

16:46.999 --> 16:48.999
everything that
she's done wrong,

16:48.999 --> 16:49.999
and why she's sorry for them.

16:49.999 --> 16:52.999
And if the conversation
doesn't go that way,

16:52.999 --> 16:55.999
then we're gonna have problems.

16:55.999 --> 16:58.999
- Surprise.
- Oh, my God.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
- I hear there's
some thirsty bitches.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
- I can't believe
you guys came.

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
- What the...?
- I know.

17:05.999 --> 17:09.999
- Moral support
and to hang out with you.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
And I just saw Kristen.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
- Surprise, bitches.
- Hi.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.999
- Oh, my God.
- Holy fááá.

17:19.999 --> 17:24.999
- This is just...
shocking and insane.

17:24.999 --> 17:25.999
Heart in butt-hole.

17:25.999 --> 17:28.999
- Hi.
Nice to see you.

17:28.999 --> 17:31.999
So actually, I know you guys
invited us to come

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
and thank you,
but my reason for coming

17:33.999 --> 17:36.999
is to talk to this one.

17:36.999 --> 17:37.999
Don't.

17:37.999 --> 17:40.999
Come here.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
- Um, glasses.

17:44.999 --> 17:48.999
- Rachael,
where are your glasses?

17:48.999 --> 17:49.999
- Um, over here.

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
- I will let you talk.

18:01.999 --> 18:05.999
- I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
- Too little, too late.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.999
- We did book a hotel room
already for tonight.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.999
Just 'cause we didn't know how
this was gonna go.

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- I mean, you're welcome
to stay the night,

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
but I understand if like--
- I know.

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
- I can't believe
I'm looking at you right now.

18:29.999 --> 18:33.999
- I tried to think about
how this would go and where,

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
and nothing seemed appropriate.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
I wasn't gonna have the
conversation at my house or at--

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
it's not a conversation
I wanted to have

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
at a restaurant or a bar
either, but--

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
- I just didn't understand.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
I thought for the longest time
what--

18:45.999 --> 18:48.999
what possibly could have been
because nothing

18:48.999 --> 18:50.999
I could have done
would have warranted that.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.999
- The way that I felt
last year

18:53.999 --> 18:57.999
when you went off
with Scheana going to her--

18:57.999 --> 19:00.999
her fáááing
bachelorette party,

19:00.999 --> 19:04.000
when I had felt like she was

19:04.000 --> 19:09.999
a huge part
of that sex tape thing

19:09.999 --> 19:11.000
and what made me so sad

19:11.000 --> 19:12.999
and, like, what was
the whole reason

19:12.999 --> 19:15.999
that I wanted nothing
to do with her,

19:15.999 --> 19:17.999
it was just such
a huge deal to me,

19:17.999 --> 19:19.999
and then I'm, like,
seeing all of the sudden

19:19.999 --> 19:22.999
you're now with this person.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
- A lot of times
it's not about you.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.999
I put my life on hold
and nothing was about me

19:27.999 --> 19:28.999
because it was about you
for so long.

19:28.999 --> 19:31.999
That's so unfair, and that's not
how friendship works.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
- Like, I know that.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.999
I know that I have literally--

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
I've made a lot
of bad decisions

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
and a lot
of selfish decisions,

19:38.999 --> 19:41.999
and I'm just trying
to realize the things

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
that I've done wrong.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
I should never
have cut you out.

19:45.999 --> 19:48.000
I've missed you.
I've missed our friendship.

19:48.999 --> 19:49.999
I haven't had a friendship
like yours.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.999
- I was looking out for you.

19:53.999 --> 19:57.999
Stassi, you're like my sister.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
Like, all of the things
we've been through,

19:59.999 --> 20:02.999
you think I'm just gonna not
give a sháá about you?

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
- Like, I--it's a big--
it's a big fáááing deal.

20:05.999 --> 20:06.999
- No sháá
because your friendships

20:06.999 --> 20:08.999
are fluff with people.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.999
I don't think friends
are disposable, period.

20:11.999 --> 20:14.999
Or people are disposable
or anything, and especially me.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
Like, I'm sorry, but I was
a fáááing amazing friend to you.

20:16.999 --> 20:20.999
And it was so, so hurtful
the way you just tossed me aside

20:20.999 --> 20:22.999
because I didn't fit
into your credo.

20:22.999 --> 20:26.999
You--you were so above and
beyond everyone and everything.

20:26.999 --> 20:29.999
And it became so gross to me.
You were never gonna step down.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.999
You were never gonna be wrong
about anything.

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
I was always gonna be
the bad guy.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.999
I was always gonna be the one
that was a sháááy friend.

20:35.999 --> 20:37.999
And that--that--I can never
actually agree

20:37.999 --> 20:39.000
or admit to that
or apologize for any of that

20:39.999 --> 20:41.999
because I never fááá
did anything wrong.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.999
- It's when I feel hurt
by someone

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
then my way of dealing with it
is, like,

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
"I can't let this person
hurt me again,"

20:48.999 --> 20:49.999
and then you're done.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.999
And--and I was wrong.
I'm telling you I was wrong.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.999
And I don't want to do those
sorts of things again to anyone.

20:55.999 --> 20:58.999
- That's great,
but too little, too late.

21:12.999 --> 21:15.999
- I've got, like, obviously,
like, amazing people in my life.

21:15.999 --> 21:19.999
You know, I just wouldn't have
time to go through that again.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
I would--
I would be a damn fool.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
- Want a drink?

21:30.999 --> 21:31.999
Oh, I don't--
I can't make that.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
That's too hard.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
Do you really want
a Metropolitan?

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
- Yes.
- I'll make it.

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
I'll figure it out.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
I just threw it together.
- Thank you.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
- What's up, dude?
- Hey, dude, what's going on?

21:55.999 --> 21:57.999
- Thanks, dude.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
So babysitting,
how do you feel about it?

21:59.999 --> 22:00.999
- I-I had a good time.

22:00.999 --> 22:03.000
But I'm just--I don't know
if I'm ready for the kid phase.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.999
Cutest kid in the world though,
I'm not gonna lie.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
He was a cute kid.
- Yeah.

22:06.999 --> 22:07.999
- But there's three of us
and we struggled.

22:07.999 --> 22:09.999
- What are you two
gossiping about?

22:09.999 --> 22:12.999
- Ah, we're just gossiping.
- Yeah, you okay?

22:12.999 --> 22:15.999
- I need a beer.
- What's going on?

22:15.999 --> 22:18.999
- Me and Katie got in
a big spat.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
- Okay, you go serve
those people over there.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
What's going on?
You're fighting with Katie?

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
- Well, Tequila Katie
reared her head.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
They were all ganging up
on Ariana,

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
and I just, like,
I stepped in,

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
and I was just trying to be
the voice of reason.

22:29.999 --> 22:31.999
I'm reminding them that,
you know, she's our friend.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
Let's try to see it from
her point of view, you know?

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
And then Katie loses it.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
She's like,
"You never have my back,"

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
which is a fight we have
all the time.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
- Well yeah, I've heard that.
- Yeah, yeah. But it's BS.

22:40.999 --> 22:43.999
- But you know what, Tom?
I've seen your relationship,

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
and I've seen--
what is that for?

22:45.999 --> 22:48.999
- Rosé for you.
- Lordy, I think I need it.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
Actually, I will
have a sip of this.

22:50.999 --> 22:53.999
- Two down.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
- You know what?
Sometimes with Katie,

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
or with women,
you don't have to solve it.

22:57.999 --> 22:58.999
You don't have to fight.

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
You don't have
to shout and scream.

23:00.999 --> 23:03.999
You don't have to do anything.
You just have to listen.

23:03.999 --> 23:04.999
- She just sometimes--
when she vents,

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
the stuff that comes out
of her mouth,

23:06.999 --> 23:08.999
it's like,
"Where is this coming from?"

23:08.999 --> 23:09.999
- Yeah, but I think
she gets frustrated

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
because she doesn't feel
that you're on her side.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
I've seen this before.
- I know. Yes, yes.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
- And I think sometimes women
want to think--like with Ken,

23:15.999 --> 23:18.999
I think even when I'm wrong,
I'm right to him.

23:18.999 --> 23:22.999
And he's probably defended me
maybe even when I've been wrong.

23:22.999 --> 23:24.999
Tom Schwartz should learn
that sometimes

23:24.999 --> 23:26.000
it's better to be wrong
and happy

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
than right
and sleeping on the couch.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
She's gone down to Palm Springs
to see Stassi.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- Yes, yes.
- Which I don't know that--

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
- Yeah.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
- Yeah.
Oh, you didn't know that.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
Katie went to Palm Springs--
- She's gone down to see Stassi.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
- I just can't believe
that she's going

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
all the way over there--I don't
think that this is a good thing.

23:40.999 --> 23:41.999
- You don't want her around,
do you?

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
- The timing couldn't be worse,
actually.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.999
- I don't think this is the
best time for Jax right now.

23:46.999 --> 23:51.999
I mean, he's got this brand-new,
shiny felony on his résumé.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
He's still at Sur doing
the same things

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
that he did when Stassi left.

23:55.999 --> 23:56.999
- It's just you don't want
a fight.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
- Gonna have a go at you.
- Oh, yeah.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
It's not up to me.
It has nothing to do with me.

24:00.999 --> 24:01.999
It's Katie
at the end of the day.

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. And--
- If she wants to take her back,

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
you know, that's on her.
- Yeah, exactly.

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
- She's been burned once.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
The worst-case scenario is
if everyone becomes friends

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
with Stassi again,
and then she convinces everybody

24:11.999 --> 24:12.999
not to be friends with me.

24:12.999 --> 24:14.999
I mean, I'm not the one
that acted like

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
my life was better
than everyone else's.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
I'm the one
that's still around.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
I didn't tell everyone
to fááá off.

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
I hope everybody
can remember that.

24:21.999 --> 24:22.999
I'm curious to see what's gonna
happen with this.

24:22.999 --> 24:25.999
- Yeah, me too.
- Now I'm, like, anxious to--

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
I just want to know.
To be a fly on that wall.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
- I know.
- To be a fly on that wall.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.999
- I haven't heard
anything break

24:37.999 --> 24:38.999
or anyone yelling,
so that's good.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
- That's positive.
- Actually I don't know

24:40.999 --> 24:41.999
which room they're in, so I--
- They're, like, right there

24:41.999 --> 24:44.000
on the right.

24:44.999 --> 24:45.999
- It's been, like--
- Shh!

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
- It's been a while.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
- Sounds calm.

24:48.999 --> 24:54.999
- I mean, like, I...

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
I hate that I missed out
on so much.

24:56.999 --> 25:01.999
Like, and I-I hate that I know
that you were

25:01.999 --> 25:04.999
one of the best friends
I've ever had.

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
'Cause I missed out on a lot,

25:06.999 --> 25:11.999
and I'm--I'm sorry
about a lot.

25:11.999 --> 25:14.999
- I know, I mean, the night
that Tom and I got engaged,

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
it was weird, like, your face,
like, flashed across me,

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
and I was just like, "Wow.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
I didn't think
that she wouldn't be here."

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
But then I would just be like,

25:22.999 --> 25:23.999
"Well, she didn't want
to be here.

25:23.999 --> 25:28.999
'Cause I'm just a big,
fat loser."

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
- I'm really sorry.

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
I'm really sorry.
- Thank you for apologizing.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
- And thank you
for listening to me.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
- I've been waiting for that
for a really, really, really,

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
really long time, and even
though I wasn't waiting anymore,

25:39.999 --> 25:40.999
I was still waiting.

25:40.999 --> 25:41.999
This might be
the very first time

25:41.999 --> 25:44.999
I've ever heard Stassi admit
she was wrong

25:44.999 --> 25:47.999
and actually sincerely
meaning it.

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
When people can just be
forthright and admit to things

25:50.999 --> 25:53.999
and take responsibility,
that goes a long way with me.

25:53.999 --> 25:57.999
And I know Schwartz said
he invited you

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
to our engagement party.

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
And I know you said
you wouldn't go

26:01.999 --> 26:04.999
unless I invited you,
so we can start with that.

26:04.999 --> 26:10.999
That you are welcome to come,
if you want to.

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
That's an invitation.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
- Like, I want to give you
a hug.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
- You can give me a hug.
- I feel like a girlfriend

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
who's seeing her ex-boyfriend.

26:17.999 --> 26:20.999
- ♪ I'd like to be
off the ground ♪

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
- Thank you.
I don't believe this.

26:30.999 --> 26:31.999
It's so weird.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
- Maybe you haven't been
giving enough time to them

26:36.000 --> 26:37.999
or attention to them.

26:37.999 --> 26:38.999
You know what friends
are like sometimes.

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
- What, are they babies?

26:49.999 --> 26:51.999
- Hi, folks.
- Hi.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
- Well.
- Come on in here, no blood.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
- We had a really,
really good conversation.

26:55.999 --> 26:58.999
It's, like, not the last--
I mean, it's, like,

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
there's gonna be
other conversations obviously.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
- You know what?
I'll take slowly.

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
I'm okay with that.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999
I mean, I don't know how
this could've gone better,

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
so this is good.

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
- I mean, Scheana,
what do you want to do?

27:10.999 --> 27:14.999
- It is up to you.
I'm doing whatever you want.

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
I mean, I already paid
for the room,

27:15.999 --> 27:18.999
so I can't get that back,
but whatever.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
- Well, then we can go.
- Unh-uh.

27:20.999 --> 27:21.999
No, you'll just pay me back.

27:21.999 --> 27:23.999
I don't care.
It's completely up to you.

27:23.999 --> 27:24.999
I'm not making the decision.
- Let's just hang out

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
for a little while.
- Whatever you want to do.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
- I want to hang out
for a little while.

27:28.999 --> 27:29.999
- I just came
for moral support...

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- Katie, what would you like?
- And that doesn't seem

27:31.999 --> 27:34.999
to be needed,
so I'm good right here.

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
I'm fine.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
When Kristen, Stassi,
and Katie

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
were all friends before,

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
they weren't people
I wanted in my life.

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
I'm like,
"This is not my sháá.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
I need my girl Ariana."

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
- Good night.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
- Good night.

27:49.999 --> 27:50.999
Katie was, like,
my new Ariana,

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
but if Katie goes back
to the dark side,

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
I just don't know where
that leaves me.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
- I literally had made a joke

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
that I had ordered
male strippers.

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
- Oh, there were no--yeah.
I was--

27:59.999 --> 28:04.999
- And I'm like,
"Those are my male strippers.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
Those are my male strippers."

28:05.999 --> 28:06.999
- But, like, right before
you arrived--

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
- And then I heard
Scheana's voice.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
- Let's have a cocktail.

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
This is exactly
what I wanted.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.999
I wanted a weekend
with all of the girls,

28:14.999 --> 28:17.999
like the old days,
and that's exactly what it is.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.999
We can get drunk and we can
go topless in the pool

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
like old times' sake.

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
- I'm just--
I'm gonna go call and...

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
- Okay.
- Tell them we're not coming.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
- ♪ You and me ♪

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999

28:47.999 --> 28:50.000
- Good morning.
- Morning, sunshine.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
- Hi.
- Good morning.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
- Um, I'm okay.
- Why are you such an adult?

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
Like, you get married
and all of a sudden you're like,

28:58.999 --> 28:59.999
"I don't need to drink
for breakfast."

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
Like, is this what happens?
I'm never getting married.

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
- I mean, Kristen,
I have news for you.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
The morning drinking
isn't the only reason

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
you shouldn't be married
right now.

29:07.999 --> 29:10.999
- Ariana was so fáááing rude
about you at the beach.

29:10.999 --> 29:11.999
It, like, pissed me off.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
- If we're gonna talk
about this today,

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
I'm gonna actually need
a drink or some--

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
- Do you want a vodka and--
- Sure, thank you.

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
- So I heard she was
talking sháá about Rachael.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
And I confronted her
about it,

29:21.999 --> 29:23.999
then it was like,
"Oh, well, Jax lied."

29:23.999 --> 29:24.999
I'm like, "Okay,
you guys might--

29:24.999 --> 29:25.999
Scheana told me it was you,
like, come on."

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
And I was like, "And that's,
like, your best friend."

29:27.999 --> 29:31.999
And she said,
"No, she's not."

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
- Fááá no, she's not.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
She has not been acting
like my best friend.

29:34.999 --> 29:35.999
She's been talking
a lot of sháá about me.

29:35.999 --> 29:36.999
- Because you're negative
and you're sour.

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
- So I wouldn't call her
my best friend.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
- It's just kind of sháááy when,
like, she knows, like,

29:40.999 --> 29:41.999
everything Shay and I
have been, like,

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
going through this summer,

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
and she's still, like,
a bitch to me.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.999
But not to him, just to me.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.999
- That's upsetting to me.
- I don't want to talk about it

29:49.999 --> 29:52.999
anymore, so I'm gonna go
put on my bathing suit.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.999
I'm gonna go jump in the pool.
- Okay.

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
- 1, 2, 3,

30:08.999 --> 30:12.999
6, 11, 12, 15, 17.

30:12.999 --> 30:13.999
Perfect.

30:13.999 --> 30:14.999
- I would bartend
for the mere fact

30:14.999 --> 30:18.999
that you guys get to just wear
cute stuff all the time.

30:18.999 --> 30:21.999
- Thing is is that you ca--you
don't want to have too much...

30:21.999 --> 30:25.999
cleave 'cause when you go
to make things, it's just like--

30:26.000 --> 30:27.999
- But then you get better tips,
babe.

30:27.999 --> 30:30.999
- Mm, mm, mm.
That's what you think.

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
The guys that want to look
at your tits

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
are the cheap assáááás.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
- Ugh.
- What are you up to?

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
- Hi.
- Listen, do you want to stop

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
messing about and go back
to the hostess stand?

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
Anything going on with you?

30:41.999 --> 30:45.999
- I'm just enjoying my time
away from Scheana and Katie.

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
- So your relationship
with Scheana's

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
pretty much broken down then?

30:49.999 --> 30:51.999
- I don't want to be
in a complicated dynamic.

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
- Life is complicated sometimes,

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
and with friends,
you can work through it.

30:55.999 --> 30:56.999
- Depends on the friends.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
- Oh, my God,
this is the best day of my life.

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

31:08.999 --> 31:13.999
I'm just...
annoyed over several things.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
I knew everyone was gonna
be friends again.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
That's what I wanted,
but now it's, like,

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
the one friend I had outside
of this group

31:20.999 --> 31:23.999
doesn't want to be my friend
anymore and it's hurtful.

31:23.999 --> 31:24.999
- But you have friends here
though.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- I know,
but it's always been you guys

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
and then me,
and now I'm a part of it,

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
but I still had that one friend.

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
Even though Ariana and I

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
haven't had the perfect
friendship this summer,

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
she's still one of
the closest people in my life,

31:35.999 --> 31:38.999
but hearing her tell Kristen

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
that she doesn't think I'm one
of her best friends anymore

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
just makes me wonder,
"Then what am I to you?"

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
All you guys are, like,

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
having fun and hanging out

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
and all friends again,
and I'm like, "Cool."

31:47.999 --> 31:50.999
All I can think about is my--

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
one of my "best friends"
so I thought, like,

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
doesn't see me that way and
doesn't fáááing like me anymore.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
- How long have you
been friends with Scheana?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
- Almost five years.

31:59.999 --> 32:00.999
- You don't throw that away.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.999
- She's not being herself
right now.

32:02.999 --> 32:06.999
- I have seen the strength
of the friendship

32:06.999 --> 32:09.999
between Scheana and Ariana.
They really loved each other,

32:09.999 --> 32:10.999
and in their times of need,

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999
they were really there
for each other,

32:13.999 --> 32:16.999
and I think it'd be sad
to see that relationship end.

32:16.999 --> 32:19.999
I mean, maybe you haven't been
giving enough time to them

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
or attention to them.
You know what friends are like.

32:21.999 --> 32:22.999
- What, are they babies?
- Sometimes if they--

32:22.999 --> 32:25.999
- I get it.
Lisa loves Scheana,

32:25.999 --> 32:27.999
and she wants everybody
to get along,

32:27.999 --> 32:29.999
but this is a completely
different situation.

32:29.999 --> 32:32.999
- And it's a shame
just to let that friendship go.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- I'm not trying to.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
- Well, sit down
and talk to her.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
- She turns into
a different person.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- It's like, well, if she can
just peace out on me so easy,

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
like, maybe
everyone else can too.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.999
- But that's what I went through
exactly with Stassi,

32:44.999 --> 32:45.999
and it's, like,
everything changed.

32:45.999 --> 32:49.999
Now, you're one of my
best friends in the whole world.

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
I'm not--they're not
my best friends anymore,

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
but you are.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
You were there
when everyone left.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.999
You know, I mean, like,
I have people that appreciate

32:57.999 --> 32:59.999
and cherish friendships
in my life,

32:59.999 --> 33:02.999
and I'm not,
like, gonna change that.

33:02.999 --> 33:05.999
Come here, my little--
my little bean.

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
I love you.
I love you so much.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
- Oh, my God, Scheana,

33:09.999 --> 33:12.999
I'm not trying to move in
and kick you out.

33:12.999 --> 33:15.999
Seriously, this isn't like
Taylor Swift and Katy Perry

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
fighting over backup dancers.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
Like, everything's
gonna be okay.

33:18.999 --> 33:21.999
- It's, like,
a really fáááing long summer.

33:21.999 --> 33:22.999
- Guess what.
- Like, the last time I was,

33:22.999 --> 33:26.999
like, away from Shay was when
we were, like, not cool at all,

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
and I just--
- I know,

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
and I'm in that same boat
right now

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
with Tom and that old me

33:31.999 --> 33:33.999
that just can be so mean

33:33.999 --> 33:36.999
and just impulsive
with things that came out

33:36.999 --> 33:37.999
and--I mean,
I shouldn't say sháá like,

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
"I don't want to marry you,"

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
and like,
"You can have the ring back.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
You can sell it
if you need the money."

33:43.999 --> 33:44.999
Like, I need to have
a conversation with him

33:44.999 --> 33:46.999
just to kind of get it all out,

33:46.999 --> 33:49.999
so that way, we really do
leave it behind us.

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
This weekend has been
all about forgiveness,

33:51.999 --> 33:53.999
but I still have to go home
and face Tom,

33:53.999 --> 33:56.999
and I don't even know
where we stand these days.

33:56.999 --> 33:57.999
Thank you so much
for being here with me.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
- Yeah, of course.
- I, like, I wouldn't--

33:59.999 --> 34:00.999
- I wasn't gonna let you
do this by yourself.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.999
- I wouldn't have been able
to do it without you, honestly.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.999
- I've never seen Kristen
without a drink in hand.

34:07.999 --> 34:09.999
That's the cause.
- Yeah, you're one to talk.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
- Katie, do you still have
a cocktail right now?

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
- Yeah.
- You want to come sit with me?

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
- Sure.

34:30.999 --> 34:31.999
This was fun.

34:31.999 --> 34:32.999
It still feels, like, surreal

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
because it's, like, I didn't
think that

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
I would ever talk to you,
we would ever be friends,

34:36.999 --> 34:38.999
and I was okay with that.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.999
- I'm really glad that you
gave me this opportunity.

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
Katie and I aren't
all the way back,

34:43.999 --> 34:45.999
but this was the first step,

34:45.999 --> 34:47.000
and I couldn't be happier
about that.

34:47.999 --> 34:49.000
- It's obviously been
a really long time

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
since we had a conversation
that wasn't heated

34:51.999 --> 34:53.999
or something like that,
but obviously, like,

34:53.999 --> 34:55.999
I'm still getting used
to a lot of things.

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- When Kristen and I
started talking again,

34:57.999 --> 35:01.999
it took a very long time
for us to get to a place

35:01.999 --> 35:04.999
where we are now,
so I get that.

35:04.999 --> 35:06.999
I get that things take a while,

35:06.999 --> 35:09.999
and so that's why I don't want
to overstep any boundaries,

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
and I-I'm just, like, trying
not to be a fáááing weirdo

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
because, like, I feel like,
okay, when I see you walk by,

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
I want to be able
to just be like,

35:16.999 --> 35:19.999
"Okay," and just, like, say
whatever, what we used to,

35:19.999 --> 35:21.999
but I know I can't
because that will take awhile.

35:21.999 --> 35:23.999
- You know, there are still,
like, reservations with me,

35:24.000 --> 35:25.999
obviously, you know?
It doesn't feel real.

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
Like, I feel like
I'd still, like--

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
I'm, like, this is--
it isn't real.

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
Like, it's--it's all
catching up with ne.

35:30.999 --> 35:34.999
I'm still very cautious
about the stuff with Stassi.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.999
We weren't on,
like, a two-week hiatus

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
where we just were, like,
giving each other space.

35:38.999 --> 35:39.999
Like, it was a year.

35:39.999 --> 35:41.999
It feels good to talk,
and it feels right.

35:41.999 --> 35:44.999
Like, I just want you to be as,
like, 100%,

35:44.999 --> 35:45.999
and I will be as well.

35:45.999 --> 35:48.999
I think we have
to kind of re-meet each other,

35:48.999 --> 35:50.999
re-get to know one another,

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
and that's gonna take some time.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
- I want you to be able
to ask me any question though

35:53.999 --> 35:54.999
that comes to your brain.

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
- I will.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.999
I don't know if you've got
your stuff together,

35:58.999 --> 35:59.999
but I think we have to leave.
- No, I know we need to leave.

36:03.999 --> 36:06.999
- I haven't been in a good mood
like this in a really long time.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.000
♪ Family's back together ♪

36:09.000 --> 36:10.999
- But it's not,
like, perfectly in place.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.999
- But it's baby steps.
- On the right track.

36:12.999 --> 36:14.999
- I'm as desperate
as Stassi is.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
I want to delete
the last two years,

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
be best friends again,
but with better men.

36:23.999 --> 36:25.999
Maybe we can, like, stop
for a cocktail closer to LA.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
- I am not gonna stop
for a cocktail.

36:27.999 --> 36:29.000
I'm driving.

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
- Can I stop for a cocktail?

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
- The last 12 hours
has been so intense.

36:35.999 --> 36:39.999
I mean, Katie shows up,
I almost sháá my pants.

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
Then Katie's being cautious,

36:41.999 --> 36:42.999
but then she's not
being cautious,

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
and I feel like
things are fine.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
I love you. It was good to talk.
- I'm gonna text you.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
- Drive safe, okay?
- Text us when you get back.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
- I don't care about caution.
Let's cut the sháá.

36:50.999 --> 36:51.999
Let's just be friends.

36:51.999 --> 36:52.999
- Ow, sháá.

36:52.999 --> 36:56.999
- It's so hot.
- I know.

37:06.999 --> 37:09.999
Hello.

37:09.999 --> 37:11.999
- Muah.
- Hi, baby.

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
- How are you?
- How are you? Good.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.999
- You look lovely.
- Good. You look great.

37:15.999 --> 37:16.999
As usual.
- Thank you.

37:16.999 --> 37:18.999
- As per usual.
- Hello, welcome.

37:18.999 --> 37:19.999
- Hi, darling, how are you?

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
- Would you like to start
with some waters?

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
- I'm gonna have oysters.

37:23.999 --> 37:24.999
- Can I get the fish and chips,
please, babe?

37:24.999 --> 37:25.999
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
May as well go
with the bad news first.

37:27.999 --> 37:30.999
I got basically fired
from Pump from DJing.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
- What?

37:32.999 --> 37:35.999
- Yeah, I went into work
drunk on Saturday.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- You went into work drunk?
- Yeah.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
- But what brought you onto
that path...

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
- Calm down, calm down.
- When you had to work?

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- Calm down a little bit.
You know, I've let Lisa down,

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
and I've let you down as well

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
since you got me the job
two years ago.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.999
- And you were happy, right?

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
- I mean, for a split second
until Kristen walked in,

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
and then everything just goes--
- But there you go.

37:52.999 --> 37:53.999
Why was Kristen at Pump?
- I don't know.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
She just showed up.

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
- If she wasn't there,
would you have gotten fired?

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
Answer me that.
That's all I want to know.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.999
- Yeah, yeah, I would have.
- Why?

37:59.999 --> 38:00.999
- 'Cause it would have
happened eventually.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
My mom's not the biggest fan
of Kristen.

38:02.999 --> 38:03.999
She wants to blame her
for the position

38:03.999 --> 38:05.999
that I'm in nowadays.

38:05.999 --> 38:07.999
But I take full responsibility
in the way I fáááed up.

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
- These ones here are
the Fanny Bay, the smooth ones.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- James will have
the Fanny ones.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
He's good at taking
a fanny out of a shell.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
- Stop it.
God's sakes.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
- You know I'm a dirty bitch.
- Oh, fááá off.

38:17.999 --> 38:19.999
- I've never seen Kristen
without a drink in hand.

38:19.999 --> 38:22.999
And that's the cause.
- Yeah, you're one to talk.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
- Please don't compare me
to Kristen.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
- But everyone--
- Do not--no, no, no, respect.

38:28.999 --> 38:29.999
- I will.
- Do not compare me to Kristen

38:29.999 --> 38:32.000
when I'm your mother.
Have some respect.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.999
- Yeah, I know,
but you like--

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- I like what, James?
- Sorry, sorry.

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
- I make mistakes.
- Stop crying. Enough.

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
People say, like,
sons date their moms,

38:40.999 --> 38:41.999
like, through girls.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.999
And that's, like,
a subconscious thing

38:43.999 --> 38:44.999
that I think I've always done.

38:44.999 --> 38:46.999
Because Kristen drinks a bottle
of white wine every day.

38:46.999 --> 38:47.999
And my mom used to do that.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.999
Kristen and my mom
actually are--

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
they're the same
fáááing person.

38:51.999 --> 38:52.999
Regardless,
I'm still gonna see her.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.999
- What the fááá?
Are you--what?

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
- It's just a conversation.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
- Oh, oh, bitch,
you got me fired,

38:57.999 --> 38:59.999
but I'm gonna sit
and have dinner with you...

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- She didn't get me fired.
- 'Cause we're cool.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.999
- Why are you saying that?
- Because there was a kerfuffle.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
- She did not get me fired.
I got me fired.

39:03.999 --> 39:05.999
I got me fired.
- No, no, no, no.

39:05.999 --> 39:06.999
No defense.
She's not your girlfriend.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.999
- Man, I love my mom.
Like, I've always been

39:08.999 --> 39:09.999
the shining light
in her eyes.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.999
Like, I could never do
anything wrong,

39:11.999 --> 39:13.999
but don't hate Kristen
because she was my ex-girlfriend

39:13.999 --> 39:16.999
and I'm your first son.
That annoys me.

39:16.999 --> 39:17.999
- You need to keep your eye
on the prize.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.999
- I've got a plan.
Quit alcohol.

39:20.999 --> 39:24.999
Get super fit.
Massive six-pack.

39:24.999 --> 39:27.999
Get my job back at Pump.
Kill the album.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.999
- And get a big, massive thing
of Calvin Klein underwear, baby.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
- Fááá, if I can, yeah, why not?
- That's what I want to see.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.999
New York, here he comes.
- 110%.

39:38.999 --> 39:39.999
- Don't try to defend them
because they're criticizing me

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
for simply living my life.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
- Stop going around touting
that I don't have your back.

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
- But that's not having
my back.

39:55.999 --> 39:59.999
♪ How could I know?
How could I know? ♪

39:59.999 --> 40:03.999
- Air?
- Hi. How are you?

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
Hi.

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
Oh, my gosh.
It was so hot there.

40:07.999 --> 40:08.999
It's so hot here too.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
What is that?
Do I smell Stassi?

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
- I walked in the kitchen.

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
The look on her face,
she was just like...

40:13.999 --> 40:15.999
and she immediately
started, like, crying.

40:15.999 --> 40:18.999
- Aww.
- Also while I was there,

40:18.999 --> 40:21.999
I also had time to think about
the whole text argument

40:21.999 --> 40:22.999
that we got into
the other night.

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
- Does what you said
still stand?

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
Can I pawn this
and start a new life?

40:25.999 --> 40:29.999
- No, Tom, I haven't gotten
to that dark place

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
in so long and, like,
feel really let down

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
that I let myself get there.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.999
And still, it was really
messed up to say that, you know,

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
I don't want to marry you
and I want to call it all off.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
I mean, like, that's just--
- "Thank God I'm not pregnant."

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
- What I feel--

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
- "I can't believe I even
ever considered you

40:44.999 --> 40:47.999
as marriage material."
- Stop, I know.

40:47.999 --> 40:48.999
- I don't understand how
when we have fights

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
how it gets to that level.

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
Sometimes I feel like there's
a nugget of truth in there.

40:52.999 --> 40:55.999
Like some of it comes from you
actually, you know, not--

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
maybe you don't love me.
- Well, it's just--no.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
No, of course--stop.
Don't even say that.

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
- I feel like somewhere--no, no.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
I feel like you
have doubts still,

41:00.999 --> 41:01.999
and if you do, that's okay.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
- I don't have doubts.
Like, you have to understand

41:03.999 --> 41:04.999
that on the other side
I'm hurt

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
and you're being insensitive
about it.

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
- Okay, yes. But it is--
- You're, like--you're not--

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
you're not hearing me out.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.000
There was a reason
that kicked it off.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.999
By, you know,
Tom and especially Ariana,

41:11.999 --> 41:14.000
I've been criticized
for my life choices,

41:14.000 --> 41:15.999
and that's what I've had
an issue with,

41:15.999 --> 41:17.999
and that's why I'm saying
don't try to defend them

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
because they're criticizing me
for simply living my life.

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
- Stop going around touting
that I don't have your back.

41:20.999 --> 41:23.999
- But that's not having--
that's not having my back.

41:23.999 --> 41:25.999
- You were ruthless.
- But you were also an assáááá.

41:25.999 --> 41:26.999
- Yeah, a little.
I was an assáááá,

41:26.999 --> 41:28.999
but it was very brief
and I apologized

41:28.999 --> 41:29.999
and I tried to squash it,

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
but you went off
the fáááing deep end.

41:31.999 --> 41:33.999
- I felt like
I wasn't being heard.

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
I felt like
I wasn't being understood,

41:34.999 --> 41:35.999
so I had to keep yelling.

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
- It was a one-way conversation
for four hours

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
of you berating me
and belittling me.

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
- Okay.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- I mean, it's like getting
in the ring with Holyfield.

41:42.999 --> 41:45.999
I'm like...fááá, man.
I was up against the ropes.

41:45.999 --> 41:48.999
- You were so, like,
on their side about stuff.

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
- No, I wasn't.
- I felt that way.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
- That's how I felt.
- Okay, yes. Okay.

41:51.999 --> 41:54.999
I can't discount your feelings.
I've learned that.

41:54.999 --> 41:57.999
God, that's--Bubbie, I don't
like when we fight like that.

41:57.999 --> 42:00.999
- I don't either.
I feel bad.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
What I thought about
was just that

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
I don't need you to, like,
defend me,

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
come in and fight
my battle and, like,

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
bear my cross,
but if I am feeling hurt,

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
if I am worked up
over something,

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
I just need you to be
loving and supportive.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.999
- Yeah, point taken.
I, like, shut down too.

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
And then I know
I do not help the situation

42:14.999 --> 42:18.999
'cause I shut off, and I just
turned into a cold assáááá.

42:18.999 --> 42:20.999
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, Bubba, I love you.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
- I love you too, man.
- And I do really want

42:22.999 --> 42:23.999
to marry you.
- Look at that.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.999
- Gordo doesn't like
when we fight.

42:25.999 --> 42:27.999
I'm sorry.

42:27.999 --> 42:29.999
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
- You keep telling me
I broke your heart, James.

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
- You did break
my fáááing heart.

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- I was so fáááing good
to you.
