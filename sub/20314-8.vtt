00:02.917 --> 00:03.500
-Okay.

00:05.709 --> 00:11.250
Today we're going to do an
exercise based on the teaching
of a woman named Jane Elliot.

00:11.291 --> 00:17.583
To show you how ludicrous
and arbitrary racism really is.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.583
So, what I want you to do,
if you have blue eyes,

00:19.625 --> 00:22.500
all the people with blue eyes
you're going to go to the right
side of the room.

00:22.542 --> 00:25.792
If you don't have blue eyes,
grab a scarf, put it around your
neck and go to this side.

00:25.834 --> 00:29.083
Let's go. Let's do that quickly
please. Blue eyes to the right.

00:29.125 --> 00:32.583
Not blue eyes, grab a scarf
around your neck go to the left.

00:32.625 --> 00:37.667
Let's go, hurry up. And here's
what the exercise is going to
be.

00:37.709 --> 00:42.750
For the day, I am going to treat
the blue eyed students much
better.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.166
I'm going to be a lot
friendlier, a lot nicer.

00:46.208 --> 00:50.583
They're going to get a longer
lunch, special privileges,
maybe a couple bonus marks.

00:50.625 --> 00:56.375
It's going to be very different
for them and how I treat this
group.

00:56.417 --> 01:01.500
It is time we all felt...racism.

01:01.542 --> 01:03.792
All of us.
-I've heard of this sir.

01:03.834 --> 01:07.667
It's a great exercise.
-It's a wonderful exercise.
Thank you Sheila.

01:07.709 --> 01:10.000
-Sir, how will the blue eyed
people know how it feels?

01:10.041 --> 01:12.750
-When we switch roles tomorrow.
-When we switch roles?
What are you ta...

01:12.792 --> 01:16.000
I can't waste another day on
this. I'm doing this one day.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.000
It's one day I thought this
was a great thing to do to
give you a little break.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.417
And it was a nice way to
show you about racism.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.250
-But sir, the exercise that...
-Sheila! No.

01:24.291 --> 01:28.125
You need to understand Sheila,
that today you're a black woman.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.709
You're wearing a scarf, which
means you don't talk today.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.166
-I think...
-I think you're a minority.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.792
And you need to stop talking
'cause you're not getting
this right now.

01:38.834 --> 01:41.792
-But, sir...
-Scarf. Okay, see how it works?

-I don't know, let me try.
-Okay. you gotta
push hard though.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.667
-And then you just lift
your arms at the end?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.667
-No, you don't lift them,
they lift on their own.
-What?!

02:57.709 --> 03:00.291
-That's the trick.
-Ah, I thought you were
just lifting your arms.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.667
-But you gotta push hard enough.
-Is it supposed to hurt?

03:02.709 --> 03:05.125
-No, it's not supposed to hurt.

-Now, move forward, your
arms will just rise up.

You didn't push hard enough.
-I'm not very strong.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.709
