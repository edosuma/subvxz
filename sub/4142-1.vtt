After all, she had no
choice in the matter.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.735

that the world is a round ball

rides on the back of a turtle

running into the stars.

that everyone knows one thing

another thing?

The world is ball

I believe.

You believe?

30:11.893 --> 30:14.312
Does that mean that
you do not know?

But you must know,
because you are king.

I know everything?

37:31.666 --> 37:38.294
Because of all the
beautiful and new things

37:38.298 --> 37:41.216
I'm learning about you

37:41.217 --> 37:45.179
day by

37:45.180 --> 37:47.223
day.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.101
ALL (SINGING): Getting to know you,

37:51.102 --> 37:55.808
Getting to know all about you.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.026
Getting to like you,

37:59.027 --> 38:02.902
Getting to hope you like me.

38:04.407 --> 38:07.034
Getting to know you,

38:07.035 --> 38:12.116
Putting it my way, but nicely,

38:12.248 --> 38:15.375
You are precisely

38:15.376 --> 38:18.500
My cup of tea!

38:20.548 --> 38:22.925
Getting to know you,

38:22.926 --> 38:27.927
Getting to feel free and easy.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.891
When I am with you,

38:30.892 --> 38:34.767
Getting to know what to say,

38:36.439 --> 38:38.941
Haven't you noticed?

38:38.942 --> 38:43.403
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy

38:43.404 --> 38:49.952
Because of all the
beautiful and new things

38:49.953 --> 38:52.871
I'm learning about you

38:52.872 --> 38:56.747
day by

38:56.835 --> 38:58.378
day.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.296
CHILDREN (SINGING):
Getting to know you,

39:42.297 --> 39:47.344
Getting to feel free and easy.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.050
When I am with you,

39:50.138 --> 39:55.265
Getting to know what to say,

39:55.476 --> 39:57.895
Haven't you noticed?

39:57.896 --> 40:02.399
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy

40:02.400 --> 40:08.822
Because of all the
beautiful and new things

40:08.823 --> 40:11.742
I'm learning about you

40:11.743 --> 40:15.698
day by

40:15.705 --> 40:17.703
day

40:19.167 --> 40:21.710
(SINGING) Getting to know you,

40:21.711 --> 40:26.382
Getting to feel free and easy.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.676
When I am with you,

40:29.677 --> 40:33.882
Getting to know what to say,

40:35.350 --> 40:37.643
Haven't you noticed?

40:37.644 --> 40:42.224
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy

40:42.231 --> 40:49.029
Because of all the
beautiful and new things

40:49.030 --> 40:51.824
I'm learning about you

40:51.866 --> 40:53.113
day

40:53.785 --> 40:55.077
by

40:55.787 --> 40:57.079
day.

41:04.212 --> 41:07.214
(SPEAKING) Goodness, this started
out to be a geography lesson.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.759
Quickly, let's get back to work.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.017
Shh! Shh! Shh!

41:18.518 --> 41:22.393
- Now...
- What is that green up there?

41:22.480 --> 41:25.148
That is Norway.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.317
Nor... way.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.604
ALL: Nor... way.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.152
Norway is a very cold place.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.116
Sometimes it is so cold,

41:34.117 --> 41:36.243
that the lakes and rivers freeze

41:36.244 --> 41:39.573
and the water becomes so hard
that you can walk on it.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.282
Walk on water?

41:41.332 --> 41:43.079
Yes, walk on water.

41:43.084 --> 41:45.002
How is it possible?

41:45.003 --> 41:46.455
Hard water?

41:46.462 --> 41:50.465
Not only that, but the raindrops
change into small white spots

41:50.466 --> 41:52.009
that look like lace.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.463
And this is called "snow."

41:54.679 --> 41:56.096
Snow.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.140
Spots of lace!

41:58.349 --> 42:02.102
Yes, Your Highness. The water freezes
on its way down from the sky.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.522
I do not believe
such thing as snow.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.941
And I do not believe
such thing as snow.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.485
And I do not believe
Siam is this big.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.487
And other country so big.

42:12.488 --> 42:16.366
- Siam is biggest country in world!
- CHILDREN: Siam!

42:16.367 --> 42:17.693
(SHOUTING)

42:20.872 --> 42:22.494
What, what, what?

42:26.127 --> 42:29.001
How can schoolroom
be so unscientific?

42:29.464 --> 42:33.050
Well, Your Majesty,
we had a little misunderstanding.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.885
I was trying to describe snow

42:34.886 --> 42:38.010
and they refused to believe
there is such a thing.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.933
Snow?

42:41.976 --> 42:43.519
Snow.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.312
From mountaintop.

42:45.313 --> 42:46.813
From sky, Your Majesty.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.316
From sky to mountaintop.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.151
That's right, Your Majesty.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.904
I remember. I see
pictures of Switzerland.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.075
Land all white with snow.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.244
Who does not believe this?

43:01.245 --> 43:04.039
Well, after all,
they've never seen it.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.166
Never seen?

43:06.167 --> 43:10.668
If they believe only what they see,
why do we have schoolroom? Rise!

43:12.340 --> 43:15.714
Never let me hear
of not believing schoolteacher

43:16.344 --> 43:20.299
whom I have bring
here at high expense.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.681
Twenty pounds each month.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.097
Twenty English pounds.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.065
Sterling!

43:30.441 --> 43:31.984
Rise!

43:33.736 --> 43:34.861
I command all of you

43:34.862 --> 43:38.862
to make most of this opportunity
for expensive education.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.157
For sake of selves and country.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.538
Furthermore, it is...

43:44.539 --> 43:47.492
What, what, what? This is not
study book I have provide.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.210
No, Your Majesty, it's one of mine.

43:50.211 --> 43:53.085
- I gave it to Tuptim.
- The name! You tell me!

43:53.381 --> 43:56.383
Is called The Small
House of Uncle Thomas.

43:56.384 --> 43:59.884
Is by American lady,
Harriet Beecher Stowe.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.472
A woman has written a book?

44:02.473 --> 44:05.809
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
A wonderful book, Your Majesty.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.728
All about the evils of
slavery in America.

44:08.729 --> 44:11.898
President Lincoln of America
against slavery, no?

44:11.899 --> 44:13.772
Very definitely, Your Majesty.

44:13.776 --> 44:15.402
Me too.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.981
Slavery very bad thing.

44:19.115 --> 44:23.445
Mr. Lincoln is fighting a war,
even now, to set the slaves free.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.412
You admire him for this?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.122
Very much, Your Majesty.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.916
He seems to be a fine man
who has studied hard

44:29.917 --> 44:32.085
and educated himself.

44:32.128 --> 44:35.127
In that, he is not unlike yourself.

44:39.135 --> 44:42.714
Shall Mr. Lincoln be winning this
war he is fighting at present?

44:42.763 --> 44:44.431
No one knows, really.

44:44.432 --> 44:48.307
Does he have enough guns and
elephants for transporting same?

44:48.644 --> 44:52.606
I don't think they have elephants
in America, Your Majesty.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.730
- No elephants?
- No.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.894
No wonder he's not winning war.

44:58.613 --> 45:01.407
All right, children,
you may be seated now.

45:06.412 --> 45:09.286
- CHOWFA: Mrs. Anna?
- Yes, Your Highness?

45:09.457 --> 45:11.416
I do not understand

45:11.417 --> 45:15.121
how slaves can be set free
if their masters wish to keep them.

45:15.796 --> 45:18.381
It's done by the passing of a law

45:18.382 --> 45:21.176
and by the enforcing of that law,
if necessary.

45:21.552 --> 45:22.969
But my slaves

45:22.970 --> 45:24.971
and the slaves of my father...

45:24.972 --> 45:28.517
Suppose there was such a law in
Siam and we did not want it so?

45:28.643 --> 45:33.480
Sometimes things can't be just a
question of what we want, Highness,

45:33.481 --> 45:35.103
but of what is right.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.360
Ha.

45:49.914 --> 45:53.333
I think perhaps we had better call
recess until after luncheon.

45:53.334 --> 45:54.876
You may be excused.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.499
(CHEERING)

46:16.148 --> 46:19.359
Young prince has healthy respect

46:19.360 --> 46:21.528
for ways of his own people.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.989
Sometimes more than king.

46:23.990 --> 46:28.411
Prince Chulalongkorn is a fine boy
with a keen and probing mind.

46:29.537 --> 46:32.081
But he still has much to learn,
Your Excellency.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.792
What is important for him to learn

46:35.793 --> 46:38.462
I do not think he'll find
in this classroom.

46:38.879 --> 46:42.465
I'm fully aware that you do not
approve of my coming to Siam.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.552
Why are you so blind?
Have you no eyes to see?

46:45.553 --> 46:48.221
King tries impossible task

46:48.222 --> 46:51.433
wishing to be scientific man
who learn all modern things.

46:51.434 --> 46:53.518
I think it a fine ambition.

46:53.519 --> 46:57.189
Inside him is strong king like
his father, who cannot change.

46:57.356 --> 47:01.231
He will only tear himself in two,
trying to be something he can never be.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.403
Of course he can never be

47:03.404 --> 47:06.156
if those closest to him
are unwilling to help him.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.576
You do not know king
as well as you think you do.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.537
You believe you have
great influence over him.

47:12.538 --> 47:15.832
You will end up as his slave
like all the others.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.125
I...

47:23.507 --> 47:25.835
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

47:43.235 --> 47:45.813
Yes, yes. Just a moment.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.745
(SPEAKING CHINESE)

47:53.746 --> 47:55.243
The king?

47:55.456 --> 47:57.579
At this hour of the night?

47:59.335 --> 48:03.631
Well, I trust His Majesty won't object
if I put some clothes on first.

48:13.099 --> 48:15.393
You sent for me, Your Majesty?

48:22.149 --> 48:23.692
Your Majesty.

48:30.616 --> 48:33.569
Oh, Your Majesty is reading
the Bible.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.582
Mrs. Anna,

48:38.833 --> 48:41.536
I think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.374
Moses?

48:43.421 --> 48:46.966
Moses, Moses, Moses.
I think he shall have been a fool.

48:46.967 --> 48:49.342
Here it stands written by him

48:49.343 --> 48:52.717
that the world was created
in six days.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.764
Now you know and I know

48:54.765 --> 48:57.809
that it took many ages
to create world.

48:58.144 --> 49:01.393
I think he shall have been a fool
to have written so.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.565
What is your opinion?

49:04.150 --> 49:07.945
Is that why Your Majesty sent for
me at this hour of the night?

49:07.987 --> 49:11.030
That is not reason, but first
I wish to discuss Moses.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.616
Now, how am I ever to learn truth

49:13.617 --> 49:16.912
if different English books
state different things?

49:18.622 --> 49:23.419
The Bible was not written by men
of science, but by men of faith.

49:24.420 --> 49:27.172
It was their explanation
of the miracle of creation,

49:27.173 --> 49:31.469
which is the same miracle whether
it took six days or many centuries.

49:40.269 --> 49:43.018
I still think your Moses
shall have been a fool.

49:44.106 --> 49:45.815
As you wish, Your Majesty.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.859
Now, was there something else?

49:47.860 --> 49:49.437
Take letter.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.530
A letter? Now?

49:52.531 --> 49:55.575
Now. When else?
Now is always best time.

49:55.576 --> 49:59.622
Take letter to Mr. Lincoln of America,
who is very scientific ruler.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.121
Very well, Your Majesty.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.707
From Phra Mana Mongut,

50:06.420 --> 50:09.672
by the blessing of the highest
super agency in the world

50:09.673 --> 50:12.877
of the whole universe,
the king of Siam.

50:13.802 --> 50:18.473
Sovereign of all tributary countries
adjacent and in every direction,

50:18.474 --> 50:21.223
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.644
Do you not have any respect for me?

50:27.149 --> 50:28.851
Why do you stand over my head?

50:29.109 --> 50:31.482
I cannot stand all the time.

50:31.779 --> 50:35.324
And in this country no one's head
shall be higher than king's.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.824
From now on in presence, you shall
so conduct like all other subjects.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.490
You mean, on the floor?

50:42.581 --> 50:44.658
All subjects do so.

50:45.042 --> 50:46.584
I'm very sorry.

50:46.585 --> 50:50.415
I shall try my best not to let my
head be higher than Your Majesty's,

50:50.673 --> 50:53.132
but I simply cannot
grovel on the floor.

50:53.133 --> 50:56.337
I couldn't possibly
work that way, or think.

51:02.851 --> 51:05.895
You are very difficult woman!

51:05.896 --> 51:07.939
Perhaps so, Your Majesty.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.650
But observe care that head
shall not be higher than mine.

51:10.651 --> 51:14.445
When I shall sit, you shall sit!
When I shall kneel, you shall kneel.

51:14.446 --> 51:17.365
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!

51:19.326 --> 51:21.403
Very well, Your Majesty.

51:22.538 --> 51:24.456
Is promise?

51:27.626 --> 51:30.705
- Is promise.
- Good.

51:38.554 --> 51:42.557
To His Royal Presidency
of the United States in America...

51:42.558 --> 51:44.977
"Abrahom Lingkong"...

51:46.937 --> 51:49.014
et cetera. You fix up.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.730
It has occurred to us...

51:54.320 --> 51:57.865
You see, it has occurred to us...

52:09.126 --> 52:12.629
it has occurred to us that if we
shall be sending you several pairs

52:12.630 --> 52:15.049
of young male elephants

52:15.132 --> 52:18.757
to be turned loose
in forests of America...

52:19.178 --> 52:21.130
A-mer-i-ca.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.265
We are of opinion

52:24.266 --> 52:28.096
that after a while
they shall increase in number.

52:28.520 --> 52:31.606
- And inhabitants of America shall...
- Your Majesty.

52:31.607 --> 52:32.732
Well?

52:32.733 --> 52:35.943
I don't think you mean pairs
of male elephants.

52:35.944 --> 52:38.272
How can I make letter
if you interrupt?

52:38.572 --> 52:43.242
And inhabitants of America shall be
able to catch and tame them

52:43.243 --> 52:46.579
and use them as beasts of burden.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.659
Only male elephants, Your Majesty?

52:54.338 --> 52:56.214
You put in the details.

52:56.215 --> 52:57.792
Good night.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.927
Moses.

53:05.224 --> 53:06.349
Lincoln!

53:06.350 --> 53:07.725
Elephants!

53:07.726 --> 53:10.850
Groveling on the floor
at 2:00 in the morning.

53:12.106 --> 53:13.307
I am Lun Tha.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.983
You are Mrs. Anna, schoolteacher?

53:15.984 --> 53:18.312
Yes, but you shouldn't be...

53:18.362 --> 53:21.441
I must meet with
Tuptim again. Please!

53:21.782 --> 53:23.950
You have been seeing her here?

53:24.368 --> 53:25.827
Twice we have spoken.

53:25.828 --> 53:28.326
Each time it becomes
more difficult.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.407
She has said you will help us.

53:30.916 --> 53:32.625
Oh, no, I couldn't!

53:32.626 --> 53:34.252
It's much too dangerous.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.587
Not for me, but for Tuptim and you.

53:36.588 --> 53:41.134
You'll be killed if they find you in
the City of Women. You must leave!

53:41.343 --> 53:45.593
Death is not worse pain than
empty life. Please, Mrs. Anna.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.182
I'm sorry, Lun Tha.

53:48.183 --> 53:50.385
There's nothing I can do.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.164
Wait there.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.603
Tuptim.

55:16.063 --> 55:17.897
Oh, Lun Tha.

55:17.898 --> 55:20.521
Seeing you this way is not enough.

55:22.069 --> 55:24.363
There is nothing we can do.

55:25.906 --> 55:29.235
I am watched too closely.

55:30.702 --> 55:34.281
Must we go on forever
hiding our love like this?

55:37.084 --> 55:42.088
(SINGING) We kiss in a shadow

55:42.089 --> 55:47.134
We hide from the moon,

55:47.135 --> 55:50.012
Our meetings are few

55:50.013 --> 55:55.265
and over too soon.

55:57.104 --> 56:02.024
We speak in a whisper,

56:02.025 --> 56:06.150
Afraid to be heard;

56:07.114 --> 56:09.949
When people are near,

56:09.950 --> 56:14.781
We speak not a word.

56:17.040 --> 56:21.836
Alone in our secret,

56:21.837 --> 56:25.631
Together we sigh

56:25.632 --> 56:29.594
for one smiling day

56:29.595 --> 56:35.848
to be free,

56:37.311 --> 56:42.233
To kiss in the sunlight,

56:42.608 --> 56:47.188
And say to the sky:

56:47.738 --> 56:50.323
Behold and believe

56:50.324 --> 56:56.531
what you see!

56:56.830 --> 56:59.457
Behold

56:59.458 --> 57:04.209
how my lover

57:04.963 --> 57:10.920
loves me!

57:14.514 --> 57:16.724
(SPEAKING)
When will we be together, Tuptim?

57:16.725 --> 57:18.051
When?

57:18.352 --> 57:20.350
It can never be, Lun Tha.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.396
Not ever.

57:24.983 --> 57:30.154
(SINGING) To kiss in the sunlight

57:30.155 --> 57:35.201
And say to the sky:

57:35.202 --> 57:38.037
Behold and believe

57:38.038 --> 57:43.210
What you see!

57:44.503 --> 57:47.213
Behold

57:47.214 --> 57:53.469
how my lover

57:53.470 --> 58:00.178
loves me!

58:10.570 --> 58:12.655
(SPEAKING) You must go now.

58:12.656 --> 58:16.110
I will be missed, and they will
start searching for me.

58:20.247 --> 58:22.950
When I return, it will be
to take you from here.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.081
There is no way, Lun Tha.

58:26.086 --> 58:28.629
There is a river. There are boats.

58:28.630 --> 58:30.207
I will find a way.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.797
Oh, if it could only be.

58:32.926 --> 58:35.800
It will be. I swear this.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.632
When all is arranged,
I will get word to you.

58:40.559 --> 58:42.261
I shall pray, Lun Tha.

58:50.986 --> 58:54.071
If you see a chaba flower in
your path, broken like this,

58:54.072 --> 58:57.526
it will be the sign that
I have come for you. Watch for it.

58:58.160 --> 58:59.987
I will be ready.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.841
(MUSIC PLAYING)

59:31.818 --> 59:33.611
Stop, stop, stop!

59:34.946 --> 59:37.194
- Your Majesty.
- What, what, what?

59:39.326 --> 59:40.652
Well?

59:40.786 --> 59:43.704
When Siam's richest province
was stolen by France,

59:43.705 --> 59:47.000
I warned it was only
beginning of Western treachery.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.337
If enemies of ours,
with lies such as this

59:51.338 --> 59:54.673
can convince British that you are
unfit to be ruler of Siam,

59:54.674 --> 59:58.799
our seas will soon be thick
with ships, greedy for conquest.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.466
So it has finally come.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.511
We must act quickly.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.056
But how? Where?

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.232
I must think.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.606
Clearly. Scientifically.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.444
I must think.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.779
(CHILDREN SINGING)

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.575
But how can I think
while being driven out of mind!

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:27.665
ALL (SINGING):
A charm from the skies

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:33.339
Seems to hallow us there

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:38.050
Which seek through the world,

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:45.260
ls ne'er met with elsewhere.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.137
(SPEAKING)
That was splendid. Very effective.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.102
Now...

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.069
- Good morning.
- You think you teach king lesson!

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.364
This is one lesson you do not
be paid for teaching!

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:06.078
You will stop instructing wives
and children in "Home Sweet House"

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.957
in order to remind me of breaking
promises I never make, et cetera.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:14.587
Your Majesty, I do not intend to
have my boy brought up in a harem.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:18.424
You did promise me a house. "A brick
residence adjoining the palace."

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:22.971
- Those were your very words.
- I do not remember such words!

01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.636
- I remember them.
- I will do remembering!

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.968
Who is king here?

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:32.271
I remind you so you remember that.
I do not remember any promises.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:36.147
I do not remember anything
except that you are my servant.

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.442
Oh, no, Your Majesty.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.030
What, what, what?

01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:44.116
I said, you are my servant!

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:48.454
No, Your Majesty, that is not true.
I am most certainly not your servant!

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:51.248
If you do not give me
the house you promised,

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.577
I shall be forced
to return to England.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.129
CHILDREN:
No! No! Please, Mrs. Anna.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:58.547

Please. We believe schoolteacher!

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.500
I believe in snow!

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.176
Do not let her go away.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:05.012
I let her do nothing
that is not my pleasure.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:08.057
It is my pleasure
that you stay here!

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:11.477
In palace! In palace!

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.351
No, Your Majesty.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:18.108
Why do you wish
to leave these children,

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:21.654
all of whom are loving you
so extraordinarily?

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:26.577
I do not wish to leave them. I love
them too, quite extraordinarily.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.787
I cannot stay where a
promise has no meaning.

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:30.996
I will hear no more!

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.832
A land where there is a wish
for Siam

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.252
to take her place
in the modern world,

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:40.923
but where everything still remains
according to the wishes of the king!

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.133
You will say no more! No more!

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:46.759
I will say no more, because
there is no more to say!

01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:47.972

Mrs. Anna, it is I, Lady Thiang.

Oh, well, come in, Lady Thiang.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:34.893
Mrs. Anna, you must
go to king at once.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.354
Indeed? And why must I?

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.149
I plan to leave on
the next sailing.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.023
Please, Mrs. Anna.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.570
Did he send you here to ask me?

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.194
No. It is I who ask you.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.951
King is in terrible distress,
not knowing where to turn.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.449
Distress?

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:58.083
Agents in Singapore have found copies
of letters to British government

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.211
which describe king as barbarian

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:05.924
and suggest necessity
of making Siam a protectorate.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.635
Oh, but that is outrageous!

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:12.973
The king is many things I dislike,
but he is not a barbarian.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.850
Then you will go to him now?

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.554
You mean, to advise him?

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:21.023
It must not sound like advice.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.817
King cannot take advice.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:28.489
And he will not bring up subject.
You must do it for him.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.996
No, Lady Thiang, I can't.
It's against all my principles.

He needs help, Mrs. Anna.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.334
Oh, but he has you.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.168
I am not equal to
his special needs.

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:51.470
Please, Lady Thiang, I simply cannot
go to him, especially without

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.048
his having asked for me.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.513
What more can I say to you?

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:02.648
(SINGING) This is a man
who thinks with his heart,

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:08.026
His heart is not always wise.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:12.991
This is a man who
stumbles and falls.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:18.619
But this is a man who tries.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:24.670

forgive and forgive,

He will not always say

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:55.910
What you would have him say,

01:05:56.369 --> 01:06:00.706
But now and then he'll say

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:06.914
something wonderful.

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:13.385
The thoughtless things he'll do

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:18.638
will hurt and worry you.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:23.854
Then all at once he'll do

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:29.482
something wonderful.

- I am sorry, Your Majesty, but...
- Good! You apologize.

- I didn't say...
- I accept.

Anything you wish
to discuss with me?

Why should I discuss
important matter with woman?

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.883
Very well, Your Majesty. In that
case I shall say good night.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.796
Good night!

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.892
Your Majesty...

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.693
- What, what, what?
- I wonder...

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.528
- When the boat came from Singapore...
- Singapore!

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:21.608
- Was there any news from abroad?
- News!

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.359
There were news!

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.703
- They call me barbarian.
- Who?

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:29.956
Parties who would use this
as excuse to steal my country.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:32.417
Now suppose you are Queen Victoria,

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:36.254
and someone say to you king of
Siam is barbarian. Do you believe?

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.506
- Well, Your Majesty...
- You will!

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:43.220
You will believe I am because
there is no one to speak otherwise.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.138
Oh, but this is a lie!

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:47.636
It is a false lie!

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.108
What have you decided
to do about it?

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:09.701
You guess.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.168
Well,

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.463
if someone were sending a lie
about me to England,

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.508
I would do my best to send
the truth to England.

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:24.386
Is that what you have decided
to do, Your Majesty?

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.682
Yes, that is what I have
decided to do. But how?

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.636
Guess how I shall do this.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:35.397
Well, my guess would be
that you would seek

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:38.316
some kind of personal contact
with the British.

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:42.320
Personal contact! When British
ambassador and party arrive in Siam...

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.148
The ambassador, here?

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:47.409
On quick tour of Orient.
Friendship tour, they say.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:51.706
I receive letters from his aide, Sir
Edward Ramsay, who accompanies him.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:54.033
Edward, coming here?

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.832
"Edward"?

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.669
You call him this?

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:05.420
We are old friends. I knew him
in London before I was married.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:14.436
When they're here, I'll take
opportunity of expressing my opinion

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.230
of thieves who would try
to steal my country.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:20.810
I will show them who is barbarian!

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:25.864
Well, what is this face you put on?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:30.911
My guess is that you will not fight
with your distinguished visitors.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.331
- I will not?
- No, Your Majesty.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.702
You will give a banquet
in their honor.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:40.045
You will entertain them in
a particularly grand manner.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:43.089
You will make them all
witnesses in your favor.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.550
They will return to England
and report to the queen

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.755
that you are most certainly
not a barbarian.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.850
Naturally!

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.435
(LAUGHS)

01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:59.141
Naturally! This is what
I shall have intended to do.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:02.984
That's it, Your Majesty.
Stand up to them.

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:05.279
Put your best foot forward.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:09.783
It's an expression, Your Majesty.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:12.285
It means put on your best clothes,

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:16.081
show them your most intelligent men
and most beautiful women.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:20.919
Shall it be proper for the British
to see my women without shoes?

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.045
Shall it be proper for my women to
put their best bare feet fonuard?

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.844
No, we shall make them look
like ladies of Europe:

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:30.637
Shoes on feet, dresses on bodies.

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:33.765
You will tell me which ladies
are most like Europeans

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:37.394
and educate them in European customs
and manner for presentation.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.771
- Also, sew dresses.
- Sew dresses?

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.231
All women shall help.

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:44.109
Don't you think it would
make a better impression

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.778
in their own manner and dress?

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:51.199
You are not being scientific. The
ambassador knows we are Siamese.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.743
I wish him to know
we are also Europeans.

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.787
Wake up! Everybody to the temple!

We will entertain
them with acrobats.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.423
We could give them
a theatrical performance.

01:13:06.424 --> 01:13:10.927
Tuptim has written a play, her own
version of Uncle Tom's Cabin.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:14.723
We shall give them theatricals.
We'll show them who is barbarian.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.559
We could make European dishes
for dinner.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.771
You teach. To be served on high
table. Long white tablecloth...

01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:23.940
- And napkins.
- Of finest silk.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:26.818
- Using best gold chopsticks.
- Chopsticks?

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:30.238
Don't you think knives and forks
would be more suitable?

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:34.284
British not scientific enough
for the use of chopsticks.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:37.704
You are to order finest
gold knives and forks.

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:42.375
Also spoons.
Why do you not think of spoons?

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:45.462
An inspired idea, Your Majesty.

We mustn't forget cigars.
Englishmen are fond of them.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:52.677
You are to make list of all eminent
Europeans residing in Bangkok

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:55.430
- for sending of invitations.
- Very well.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:59.100
You will instruct court musicians
their learning music of Europe

(GUESTS APPLAUDING)

01:41:51.063 --> 01:41:54.024
Very clever. Very clever,
Your Majesty.

01:41:54.025 --> 01:41:56.648
Author! Author!

01:43:05.596 --> 01:43:06.763
KING: Ah.

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:09.474
Is there anything else
before I say good night?

01:43:09.475 --> 01:43:11.177
Sit, sit, sit.

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:15.021
Plenty for two. Eat.

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.395
Oh, no, thank you.

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:21.900
Fork is a foolhardy instrument.

01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:24.948
You pick up food, and it leaks.

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:26.700
(LAUGHING)

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:30.829
Oh, your conversation at dinner
was most amusing, Your Majesty.

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:34.159
I was forced to laugh myself.
I was so funny.

01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:39.713
Before leaving, Edward confided that
the ambassador was quite impressed.

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:42.674
Edward.

01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:47.843
And he will most certainly send
a glowing report to Queen Victoria.

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:52.055
I am so pleased, Your Majesty.

01:43:53.477 --> 01:43:56.681
I am aware of your interest.

01:43:58.524 --> 01:44:00.351
I wish to say...

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:04.230
you have been of great help
to me in this endeavor.

01:44:06.699 --> 01:44:08.697
I wish to make gift.

01:44:11.287 --> 01:44:12.909
I have hope you accept.

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:18.585
Put it on.

01:44:18.586 --> 01:44:20.413
Put it on finger.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:24.170
Oh, put it on,
put it on, put it on.

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:31.048
Your Majesty,
I don't know what to say.

01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:35.643
When one does not know
what to say...

01:44:35.644 --> 01:44:38.063
it is a time to be silent.

01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:48.865
It is late, Your Majesty.
If there's nothing else...

01:44:48.866 --> 01:44:51.319
There is, there is, there is else.

01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:53.912
Have good news to tell.

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:59.083
Yesterday, a white elephant has been
discovered in forest of Ayutthaya.

01:44:59.084 --> 01:45:01.294
And you regard this as a good omen?

01:45:01.295 --> 01:45:03.623
Yes. Very good omen.

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:09.003
Everything going well with us?

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:13.891
Yes, everything going well with us.

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:24.106
Tuptim, your pupil.

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:25.944
Her play tonight.

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:29.072
Oh, but, Your Majesty,
everyone enjoyed it immensely.

01:45:29.073 --> 01:45:33.449
It is immoral for king to drown when
pursuing slave who deceive him.

01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:35.989
Immoral. Immoral!

01:45:37.081 --> 01:45:40.083
Tuptim shall hear of my displeasure
when she is found.

01:45:40.084 --> 01:45:41.417
Found?

01:45:41.418 --> 01:45:44.337
It is believed she hides
somewhere in palace...

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:47.587
to escape king's anger and...

01:45:50.970 --> 01:45:52.296
You know something of this?

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:56.634
- Only that she has been unhappy.
- Why unhappy?

01:45:57.268 --> 01:45:58.811
She is in palace of king!

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:03.773
What is greater honor for girl
than to be in palace of king?

01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:08.400
Oh, but, Your Majesty, of what interest
to you is one girl like Tuptim?

01:46:08.654 --> 01:46:10.905
In your house,
she's just another woman.

01:46:10.906 --> 01:46:15.368
As a bowl of rice is just another bowl
of rice, no different from any other.

01:46:15.369 --> 01:46:18.163
Now you understand about women.

01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:23.209
So many English books I read
introduce strange idea...

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:27.210
of love, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:29.048
You disapprove?

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:32.970
But it is a silly complication
of a pleasant simplicity.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:37.137
A woman is designed for
pleasing man. That is all.

01:46:37.266 --> 01:46:40.518
A man is designed to be pleased
by many women.

01:46:40.519 --> 01:46:42.979
How do you explain the fact,
Your Majesty...

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:45.979
that many men remain
faithful to one wife?

01:46:46.859 --> 01:46:48.561
They are sick.

01:46:49.153 --> 01:46:51.613
But you do expect women
to be faithful.

01:46:51.614 --> 01:46:53.740
- Naturally.
- Well, why naturally?

01:46:53.741 --> 01:46:55.818
Because it is natural.

01:46:56.994 --> 01:46:59.572
It is like old Siamese rhyme:

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:03.159
(SINGING)
A girl must be like a blossom

01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.920
with honey for just one man.

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.675
A man must live like honeybee

01:47:12.176 --> 01:47:15.220
and gather all he can.

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:19.262
To fly from blossom to blossom,

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:23.266
A honeybee must be free,

01:47:23.979 --> 01:47:27.809
But blossom must not ever fly

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:31.061
from bee, to bee, to bee.

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:37.068
(SPEAKING) Oh, Your Majesty, in my country
we have a far different attitude.

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:40.370
We believe that
for a man to be truly happy...

01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:43.450
he must love one woman
and one woman only.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.541
This idea was invented by woman.

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:48.127
But it's a beautiful idea,
Your Majesty.

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:50.338
In England, we're
brought up with it.

01:47:50.339 --> 01:47:53.549
And by the time a young girl
goes to her first dance...

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:55.093
Young girl?

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:56.719
They dance also?

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.430
Like tonight?
In arms of man not her husband?

01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:00.932
Why, of course.

01:48:00.933 --> 01:48:02.510
I would not permit.

01:48:02.643 --> 01:48:04.937
Oh, but it's very exciting.

01:48:05.437 --> 01:48:07.063
When you're young...

01:48:07.064 --> 01:48:09.232
at your first dance...

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:12.107
and you're sitting
on a small gilt chair...

01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:13.938
with your eyes lowered...

01:48:14.989 --> 01:48:17.692
terrified that you'll be
a Wallflower.

01:48:18.283 --> 01:48:21.657
And suddenly you see
two black shoes...

01:48:22.746 --> 01:48:24.573
a white waistcoat...

01:48:25.624 --> 01:48:29.294
a face. It speaks.

01:48:30.295 --> 01:48:33.047
(SINGING)
We've just been introduced,

01:48:33.048 --> 01:48:35.675
I do not know you well.

01:48:35.676 --> 01:48:40.972
But when the music started,
something drew me to your side.

01:48:40.973 --> 01:48:43.599
So many men and girls

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.223
Are in each other's arms,

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.305
It made me think

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:51.142
we might be

01:48:51.567 --> 01:48:56.318
similarly occupied.

01:48:57.406 --> 01:49:01.577
Shall we dance?

01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:07.332
On a bright cloud of
music shall we fly?

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:10.210
Shall we dance?

01:49:10.502 --> 01:49:15.173
Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"

01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:18.259
Oh, perchance

01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:23.011
when the last little star
has left the sky.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:28.559
Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,

01:49:28.645 --> 01:49:33.191
And shall you be my new romance?

01:49:33.776 --> 01:49:38.905
On the clear understanding that
this kind of thing can happen,

01:49:38.906 --> 01:49:40.239
Shall we dance?

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.491
Shall we dance?

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:43.285
Shall we dance?

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.425
(SPEAKING) Why do you stop?
You dance pretty. Go on.

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:03.346
Your Majesty, I didn't realize.
After all, I'm not a dancing girl.

01:50:03.347 --> 01:50:06.349
In England, no woman dances alone
while a man looks on.

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:09.102
But she dances with
stranger, holding hands?

01:50:09.103 --> 01:50:11.270
Yes, but not always a stranger.

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:14.524
- Usually a very good friend.
- Then we'll dance together.

01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:16.651
You show me. Teach, teach, teach.

01:50:16.652 --> 01:50:18.486
It's quite simple, the polka.

01:50:18.487 --> 01:50:21.447
You count, "One, two, three,
and one, two, three...

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:23.533
and one, two, three, and..."

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:24.784
(SINGING) Shall we dance?

01:50:24.785 --> 01:50:26.035
One, two, three, and.

01:50:26.036 --> 01:50:29.413
On a bright cloud of
music shall we fly?

01:50:29.414 --> 01:50:30.706
One, two, three, and.

01:50:30.707 --> 01:50:31.958
Shall we dance?

01:50:31.959 --> 01:50:33.209
One, two, three, and.

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:36.420
Shall we then say "goodnight"
and mean "goodbye?"

01:50:36.421 --> 01:50:37.797
One, two, three, and.

01:50:37.798 --> 01:50:39.466
Oh, perchance

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:44.138
when the last little
star has left the sky.

01:50:44.888 --> 01:50:49.600
Shall we still be together
with our arms around each other,

01:50:49.601 --> 01:50:53.601
And shall you be my new romance?

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:58.901
On the clear understanding that
this kind of thing can happen,

01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:00.111
Shall we dance?

01:51:00.112 --> 01:51:01.404
Shall we dance?

01:51:01.405 --> 01:51:03.107
Shall we dance?

01:51:03.615 --> 01:51:08.446
- (SPEAKING) And one, two, three...
- One, two, three, one, two, three...

01:51:08.829 --> 01:51:10.288
Something wrong.

01:51:10.289 --> 01:51:12.912
I know, I forgot "and."
Next time I remember.

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:14.918
BOTH: One, two, three,
and one, two, three...

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.420
That's splendid, Your Majesty.

01:51:17.421 --> 01:51:19.339
Splendid, splendid!

01:51:20.465 --> 01:51:22.588
You throw me off count!

01:51:23.552 --> 01:51:28.258
BOTH: And, one, two, three,
and one, two, three, and...

01:51:28.891 --> 01:51:30.183
That is not right.

01:51:30.184 --> 01:51:32.810
You were doing beautifully,
Your Majesty.

01:51:32.811 --> 01:51:36.732
No, no. Not the way I see
Europeans dancing tonight.

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:39.150
Yes, it was. It was just like that.

01:51:39.151 --> 01:51:41.979
Were not holding two
hands like this.

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:48.910
No...

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.493
as a matter of fact.

01:51:53.165 --> 01:51:54.537
Was...

01:52:01.506 --> 01:52:03.174
like this?

01:52:03.884 --> 01:52:05.131
No?

01:52:06.053 --> 01:52:07.303
Yes.

01:52:07.304 --> 01:52:08.630
Come.

01:52:47.010 --> 01:52:48.507
(PANTING)

01:53:05.696 --> 01:53:07.196
Come.

01:53:07.197 --> 01:53:08.694
We do it again.

01:53:16.915 --> 01:53:19.789
(BELL GONGS)

01:53:22.212 --> 01:53:24.213
- Your Majesty...
- Why do you burst in here?

01:53:24.214 --> 01:53:26.257
We have found Tuptim.

01:53:29.052 --> 01:53:32.221
- Where is she?
- Secret police are questioning her.

01:53:32.222 --> 01:53:34.641
Her lover has not been caught.
Not yet.

01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:35.975
What?

01:53:35.976 --> 01:53:38.769
It is believed she was
running away with Lun Tha...

01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:40.972
man who bring her here from Burma.

01:53:42.065 --> 01:53:43.562
Dishonor.

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:46.436
Dishonor. Dishonor!

01:53:47.321 --> 01:53:50.573
- Bring her in.
- Your Majesty, what will you do?

01:53:50.574 --> 01:53:53.072
I shall do what is usually done
in such event.

01:53:53.243 --> 01:53:54.945
TUPTIM: No. No!

01:53:55.329 --> 01:53:58.914
No! Mrs. Anna,
do not let them beat me.

01:53:58.915 --> 01:54:00.913
Do not let them!

01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:04.086
- Where is this man?
- I do not know.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:06.130
It is known you were
lovers with him.

01:54:06.131 --> 01:54:08.382
I was not lovers with this man!

01:54:08.383 --> 01:54:09.835
Dishonor!

01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:15.140
- We will have truth of you.
- Stop that! Do you hear? Stop it!

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:18.059
It is better if you
understand at once...

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:20.144
that this does not concern you.

01:54:20.145 --> 01:54:23.397
Oh, but it does, Your Majesty.
It does, dreadfully.

01:54:23.398 --> 01:54:26.275
Because of her, and even
more because of you.

01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:29.236
She's a child, running away
because she was unhappy.

01:54:29.237 --> 01:54:30.863
Can't you understand that?

01:54:30.864 --> 01:54:32.448
You waste my time!

01:54:32.449 --> 01:54:35.701
I beg of you not to take revenge
on this girl.

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:40.247
You'll throw away everything you've
accomplished for yourself and country.

01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:44.043
The girl hurt your vanity, that's all.
She didn't hurt your heart.

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:45.669
You have no heart!

01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:48.547
You've never loved anyone
and you never will.

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:50.174
I will show you. Give me.

01:54:50.175 --> 01:54:53.094
I can't believe you will do
this dreadful thing!

01:54:53.095 --> 01:54:57.181

- No, no. Not orders.
- Silence!

Who can say what it is
that makes a man die?

Ever since night of great banquet, he
has shut himself away in palace...

only to push them aside in despair.

change his ways quickly...

He would not listen.

was forbidden to speak of it.

I am frightened
because I love my father...

dies, I shall be king.

they become kings, Your Highness.

It will be good to think back...

on all that
Mrs. Anna has taught you.

01:59:55.355 --> 01:59:59.310
When king heard you were sailing
tonight, he started to write letter.

01:59:59.859 --> 02:00:02.608
It was difficult for
him, Mrs. Anna.

02:00:03.238 --> 02:00:04.985
Very difficult.

02:00:05.573 --> 02:00:08.401
He has commanded
that I give it to you.

02:00:16.918 --> 02:00:20.964
Please, may I hear what
my father has said, Mrs. Anna?

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:36.512
"While I am lying here...

02:00:36.688 --> 02:00:38.890
I think perhaps I die.

I have not got...

is that he shall have tried
his utmost best.

02:00:57.834 --> 02:01:02.289
In looking back, I discover that
you think much on those people

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:05.633
who require that you
live up to best of self.

02:01:07.177 --> 02:01:10.051
You have spoken truth
to me always...

02:01:10.889 --> 02:01:14.263
and for this I have often
lost my temper on you.

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.686
But now I do not wish to die...

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:20.731

most earnest help of all.

But, Mrs. Anna,
you must remember...

02:01:35.705 --> 02:01:38.909
that you have been
a very difficult woman...

02:01:40.043 --> 02:01:43.247

than generality."

does that make you friends again?

02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:27.127
I suppose so, Louis.

02:02:27.632 --> 02:02:30.255
We can't hurt each other anymore.

You two could have been
such good friends.

In many ways he was
just as young as you.

Was he as good a king
as he could have been?

02:02:50.321 --> 02:02:54.617
I don't think any man has ever been
as good a king as he could have been.

02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:57.828
But this one tried.

02:02:58.538 --> 02:03:00.490

don't you, Mother?

Is there nothing you would do?

02:09:22.546 --> 02:09:24.172
I...

02:09:24.173 --> 02:09:26.501
would make proclamations.

02:09:26.676 --> 02:09:28.549
Yes. Yes?

02:09:29.178 --> 02:09:32.473
First, I would proclaim
for coming New Year...

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.182
fireworks.

02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:36.184
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:09:36.185 --> 02:09:38.012
Also boat races.

02:09:38.521 --> 02:09:40.064
Boat races?

02:09:40.356 --> 02:09:43.230
Why boat races
with New Year's celebration?

02:09:44.694 --> 02:09:46.567
I like boat races.

02:09:46.904 --> 02:09:49.864
And, Father, I would make
second proclamation.

02:09:49.865 --> 02:09:52.363
Yes, what is second proclamation?
Make it, make it.

02:09:52.952 --> 02:09:55.701
Regarding custom
of bowing to king...

02:09:56.205 --> 02:09:58.407
in fashion of lowly toad.

02:09:59.959 --> 02:10:02.085
I do not believe
this is good thing.

02:10:02.086 --> 02:10:04.546
Causing embarrassing fatigue
of body...

02:10:04.547 --> 02:10:07.048
degrading experience for soul...

02:10:07.049 --> 02:10:09.217
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

02:10:09.218 --> 02:10:11.091
This is bad thing.

02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:14.803
I believe.

02:10:20.438 --> 02:10:23.266
You are angry with me, my father?

02:10:23.733 --> 02:10:26.812
Oh, why do you ask question?

02:10:27.737 --> 02:10:29.610
If you are king...

02:10:30.531 --> 02:10:32.984
you are king!

02:10:34.744 --> 02:10:37.242
Don't ask question of sick man.

02:10:39.373 --> 02:10:40.620
Nor...

02:10:41.208 --> 02:10:42.660
of woman.

02:10:44.170 --> 02:10:46.122
This proclamation...

02:10:46.964 --> 02:10:49.132
against bowing to king...

02:10:50.092 --> 02:10:53.922
I believe to be your fault.

02:10:55.473 --> 02:10:57.801
Oh, I hope so, Your Majesty.

02:10:58.934 --> 02:11:00.636
I do hope so.

02:11:02.813 --> 02:11:04.640
Up! Rise up!

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:10.945
Father?

02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:14.067
Up, up. up!

02:11:15.159 --> 02:11:17.612
Like soldiers in lines.

02:11:21.332 --> 02:11:23.159
It has been said.

02:11:24.585 --> 02:11:27.129
There shall be no more bowing...

02:11:28.798 --> 02:11:30.625
for showing...

02:11:30.966 --> 02:11:32.634
respect...

02:11:33.302 --> 02:11:34.924
for king.

02:11:39.975 --> 02:11:42.223
It has been said by one...

02:11:44.939 --> 02:11:47.107
who has been trained...

02:11:48.275 --> 02:11:50.227
for royal...

02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:52.772
government.

02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:08.253
There shall be no bowing like toad.

02:12:08.254 --> 02:12:09.587
No crouching.

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:11.423
No crawling.

02:12:11.424 --> 02:12:15.754
This does not mean, however, that
you do not show respect for king.

02:12:16.178 --> 02:12:18.888
You will stand with
shoulders back...

02:12:18.889 --> 02:12:21.217
and chin high, like this.

02:12:22.351 --> 02:12:25.145
You will face king
with proud expression...

02:12:25.146 --> 02:12:28.441
showing pride in self
as well as in king.

02:12:29.567 --> 02:12:33.362
This is proper way for men
to show esteem for one another...

02:12:33.404 --> 02:12:37.734
by looking upon each other's faces
with calmness of spirit...

02:12:37.825 --> 02:12:40.743
eyes meeting eyes in equal gaze...

02:12:40.744 --> 02:12:44.744
bodies upright, standing as men
were meant to stand...

02:12:44.915 --> 02:12:47.789
with dignity and awareness of self.

02:12:48.294 --> 02:12:50.588
So from this day forward...

02:12:51.305 --> 02:12:57.666
