00:28.960 --> 00:31.520
Is this because of what I suggested after we watched

00:31.520 --> 00:32.640
Fifty Shades Of Grey?

00:34.160 --> 00:35.640
Happy birthday!

00:39.200 --> 00:41.520
Can you put it back on again?

00:41.520 --> 00:43.240
It's an escape room.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.840
- A what?
- Well, you must have heard of them.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.400
- It's basically a room...
- And you have to escape.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.640
- So you do know!
- No, I just understand words.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.120
They're like a big interactive puzzle.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.120
The challenge is you're trapped somewhere

00:56.120 --> 00:57.960
and you have to try and find your way out.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.080
Right, well, call me Harry Houdini,

01:00.080 --> 01:02.320
but my instincts are pointing that way.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.040
We haven't started yet.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.120
The idea is that you're faced with problems

01:06.120 --> 01:08.120
that make the situation more difficult.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.560
- What sort of problems?
- How do, son?

01:13.360 --> 01:15.680
- Where's the bar?
- There's no bar, Frank.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.960
Like I told you on the phone, it's an escape room.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.800
When I was married to Lee's mum,

01:19.800 --> 01:21.880
an escape room was what we called the bar.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.280
It must have been a very difficult one, Dad,

01:25.280 --> 01:26.840
because you were in there for days.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.840
- Happy birthday, Lee!
- Happy birthday!

01:30.840 --> 01:32.320
Well, what do you think, Mum?

01:32.320 --> 01:35.160
Oh, it's so exciting! Who knows what might happen!

01:35.160 --> 01:36.640
Yeah, what is going to happen?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.640
I've no idea. When you book online, they tell you nothing.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.400
I hope you're not going to make the same mistake as last year, Lucy.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.840
Ah, yes, the notorious Thorpe Park outing.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.080
I don't know why everyone keeps banging on about that.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.960
Those rides are supposed to make you scream.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.640
When you're on them, yes, but not while you're in the queue.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.880
Oh, this is...lovely.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.560
Sorry we're late.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, God knows how we're going to cope with an escape room.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.800
It took Anna three hours to get out of the bathroom.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.039
Let's crack on and try to get this solved,

02:10.039 --> 02:12.680
then we can get to Wetherspoons.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.320
It's Free-Pie-With-Every-Fourth-Pint Day today.

02:15.320 --> 02:19.160
How lovely, Frank. You can't buy class.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.960
True, but you've certainly tried.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.280
Look, there's an envelope on the table!

02:24.280 --> 02:26.440
You're the birthday boy, Lee, you should open it.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.280
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. What's the scariest thing it could be?

02:29.280 --> 02:30.840
Tickets for Thorpe Park.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.960
"You will see a padlock on the door.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.160
"Use it to lock the door from the inside."

02:41.160 --> 02:44.040
So...the adventure begins!

02:44.040 --> 02:47.360
Oh, hang on, don't do that. We'll be locked in!

02:47.360 --> 02:49.720
Yeah, maybe I should grab my phone from the car first

02:49.720 --> 02:52.640
- in case of an emergency.
- Oh, for God's sake, Toby, relax!

02:52.640 --> 02:55.600
Sorry, my husband does have an irritating tendency

02:55.600 --> 02:57.240
to be overly cautious.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.680
I don't know, I did say, "Until death do us part."

03:01.360 --> 03:03.480
No, the rules are, no phones.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.960
They were very specific about that on the e-mail.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.240
Wendy Adams doesn't cheat.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.080
Well done.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.280
I hope there's someone close by in case we need to open this door.

03:15.280 --> 03:18.160
Well, I assume you were greeted by the organisers.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.160
No, we followed the sign that said, "Go straight to the cellar".

03:21.160 --> 03:22.760
- Well, that's what we did.
- And us.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.640
Look, it's all perfectly safe.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.880
They'll be monitoring us...somehow.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.680
Lee, they'll open the door in an emergency.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.080
- You mean, if we want to go and buy...
- Not for drinks, Frank.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.200
This is the worst lock-in ever.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.960
So, now what?

03:39.960 --> 03:43.400
When my friend Pippa did a zombie escape room, they told her nothing.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.440
She just had to start looking for clues.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.080
I say we begin by examining the room.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.640
Ask yourself, what would Holmes do?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.640
- Sherlock?
- No, Eamonn.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.000
Presumably we should start by taking this cover off the table.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.840
Hm! It appears to be some kind of bomb.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.400
How exciting! Let's press the button!

04:09.400 --> 04:11.480
Don't do that!

04:11.480 --> 04:13.120
It's not going to kill you, Lee.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.920
These places work on repeat business.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.800
I know it's not going to kill us, I'm not an idiot.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.600
But it might, you know, shoot out sparks and make a loud noise.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.880
You mean like the ghost train?

04:23.880 --> 04:25.960
If anyone else mentions what I was like

04:25.960 --> 04:27.800
at Thorpe Park last year, I'll...

04:27.800 --> 04:29.120
Scream?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.120
Fine!

04:32.120 --> 04:34.920
Oh, my goodness, Lee, what have you done?

04:34.920 --> 04:37.560
- We've only got 60 minutes to live!
- You what?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.080
Don't worry, you were obviously supposed to press the button.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.880
There's no game without the bomb.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.000
So we clearly need to defuse it.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.920
There's something else written on the back of this note.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.680
"Look inside the cupboard door."

04:48.680 --> 04:50.520
Well, I've already looked, it's empty.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.040
No, you looked behind the door.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.400
You didn't look inside the door.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.280
Ah, well done, Frank! Very clever.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.880
Yes, well done, Frank.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.520
All those years of hiding things

05:01.520 --> 05:03.760
from prison wardens not completely wasted.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.880
It's a videotape.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.440
Oh, it's bang up to date, this experience, isn't it?

05:09.440 --> 05:12.680
What else is in there, a ZX Spectrum and the cast of Byker Grove?

05:15.040 --> 05:18.640
Greetings, my new friends, and welcome to my humble abode.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.320
It may not look like much but, believe me,

05:21.320 --> 05:25.720
it has everything you need to make your day go with a bang.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.680
I recognise that actor. Was he in Doctor Who?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.560
He's not an actor.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.440
Yeah, you can say that again.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.880
He's a deranged madman, remember?

05:35.880 --> 05:38.040
So, can we all get into the swing of the game, please?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.200
Well, I'm sure I've seen him before somewhere.

05:42.240 --> 05:45.360
Yeah, well, it wasn't the BAFTAs, I'm telling you that.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.440
By now, you're probably all wondering, "Why am I here?"

05:49.440 --> 05:51.000
Yep.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.680
Allow me to explain.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.000
Life, as I see it, is one big test.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.480
And I failed, or so society told me.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.800
This handsome fellow was me a year ago, with my wife Penny.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.600
This was before I was sacked from my job -

06:07.600 --> 06:10.720
or streamlining, as they called it.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.320
Three months after this photo was taken, she left me.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.200
She took the kids with her.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.960
All because I failed to make the grade.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.280
Well, now, I'm putting you to the test.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.440
Pass and you leave in one piece.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.520
Fail...

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
..and you leave in hundreds of pieces.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.920
You probably think I've got a screw loose,

06:35.920 --> 06:39.800
but don't keep yourselves in the dark for too long.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.560
I reckon that last bit was a clue.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.760
Oh, well done, Toby. Nothing gets past you.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.040
Hard to believe this is my husband's first escape room.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.240
Did you not do the zombie escape room, Toby?

06:51.240 --> 06:53.560
No. But I do share a bedroom with Anna.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.600
Maybe we have to search for something.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.320
Let's think outside the box.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.800
He said his wife's name was Penny, short for Penelope,

07:02.800 --> 07:06.320
who, as Homer tells us, was the wife of Odysseus.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.280
I suspect that is the key to solving this challenge.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.880
Found it!

07:10.880 --> 07:12.520
Well, where did that come from?

07:12.520 --> 07:14.920
Well, as he said, there was a screw loose, and there was,

07:14.920 --> 07:16.440
on the back of this unit.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.320
So I took off a panel and I found this.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.360
- He beat you to it again, Dad.
- Hm.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.480
Yes, or as Homer tells us, "D'oh"!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.360
Well done, Frank, you're clearly ahead of the rest of us.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.880
Yes, well done, Frank.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.280
Somehow managing to get inside the mind of a bitter,

07:32.280 --> 07:34.560
delusional alcoholic better than anyone else.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.520
- Well, open it, then.
- How♪ It's a lock with numbers on.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.560
- I think I've got it.
- Go on!

07:40.560 --> 07:43.360
Was he the coroner in Midsomer Murders?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.640
It's Lee's birthday, try putting in his age.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.120
It's a three-digit padlock.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.240
All right, try putting in Geoffrey's age.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.520
It's quite clear to me how we should work this out.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.600
He said we wouldn't be in the dark for long.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.360
Now, if that's as literal as his previous clue,

08:00.360 --> 08:05.400
all we have to do is switch the lights off, thus revealing...

08:05.400 --> 08:08.040
Oh, yeah, it's gone dark, Geoffrey.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.560
Who'd have guessed that's what a light switch did?

08:10.560 --> 08:11.600
I assumed there'd be

08:11.600 --> 08:13.720
glow-in-the-dark numbers painted on the wall.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.720
Can someone just turn the lights on, please?!

08:16.720 --> 08:18.720
Good God, switch them off again.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.720
Frank, what are you doing?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.720
You see, there's two bulbs here.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.640
One's normal, one's ultraviolet.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.240
If I take out the normal one...

08:29.920 --> 08:33.200
- ..it just leaves...
- Look! Frank, that's brilliant!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.640
How do you know about UV lights?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.280
They've got them in strip clubs.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.320
How intriguing!

08:48.320 --> 08:49.800
Ever worn handcuffs, Wendy?

08:51.480 --> 08:54.800
No, Frank, but I'm sure you've had to wear a few in your time.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.200
- What's happening?!
- Maybe they've turned them off because

09:01.200 --> 09:02.640
someone's about to get murdered!

09:02.640 --> 09:05.440
- I nominate Frank.
- Will someone find the bloody switch?!

09:05.440 --> 09:08.680
- Found it!
- Argh! That's not the switch!

09:08.680 --> 09:10.240
Sorry.

09:10.240 --> 09:12.680
- Argh! What's the matter?
- Somebody just grabbed my arm!

09:12.680 --> 09:14.040
Calm down, it's just a game!

09:14.040 --> 09:16.440
They've put something on me! Get it off!

09:18.640 --> 09:20.360
Right, come on, who did this?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.240
It's probably part of the game.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.600
Not everything that happens is part of the game, Dad.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.440
If I suddenly kick you in the bollocks, is that part of the game?

09:27.440 --> 09:29.640
I'd say it's worth a try.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.040
That door is padlocked from the inside,

09:32.040 --> 09:33.840
which means one of you lot must have done it.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.160
So whoever it was, get them off right now!

09:36.160 --> 09:38.120
Oh, calm down, Lee, it's not a real bomb!

09:38.120 --> 09:40.520
It probably just shoots out confetti.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.680
Yes, in my face!

09:42.680 --> 09:45.360
Yeah, it could go in his eye and cause an ocular trauma.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.080
Oh, for God's sake, Toby,

09:47.080 --> 09:50.160
no-one ever had a traumatic experience triggered by confetti!

09:56.760 --> 09:58.880
There's something engraved on these.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.920
"Find the enemy within."

10:00.920 --> 10:03.320
If that message was on the handcuffs from the start,

10:03.320 --> 10:05.880
it means that whichever one of us did this to Lee

10:05.880 --> 10:07.880
is in cahoots with the organisers!

10:07.880 --> 10:10.080
How exciting! We've got a dirty rat!

10:11.160 --> 10:14.320
And it's obvious who - Lucy. She's the one that did the booking

10:14.320 --> 10:16.920
and the only one that's been in contact with them.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.240
Not necessarily.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.400
When I booked, they asked me

10:19.400 --> 10:21.800
to provide the e-mail addresses of everyone in the group.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.360
Seemed odd at the time, but now I know why.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.400
- So, it's not you?
- No.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.000
- Anna?
- It's not me.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
- Toby?
- Not me either.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.480
- Dad?
- It's not me.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.760
Well, it's a brilliant system, Lee.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.000
It's only a matter of time before one of them cracks.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.920
This is pointless. It could be any one of us!

10:40.920 --> 10:44.200
Well, except Lee. It was a surprise, so I didn't give his e-mail.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.960
So how are we going to find out?

10:45.960 --> 10:48.440
I say the good, old-fashioned way, let's beat it out of them.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.640
Yes, good idea. I say we start with Frank.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.760
There must be a logical way of working out this.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.000
We need to examine all the clues in the room.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.280
And I say we start...with that swan over there.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.520
Hang on, why is he in charge?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.120
Because in any hostage situation,

11:07.120 --> 11:08.960
a natural order begins to take place.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.120
One person becomes the leader,

11:11.120 --> 11:14.920
others decide to stand on a table and become a stripper.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.320
This is how the Nazis started.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.960
All locked in an underground bunker with their husbands and wives?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.480
Actually, I think that's how the Nazis ended.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.040
Well, I'm not happy him taking the lead.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.480
All right, Frank, if you feel so strongly,

11:29.480 --> 11:32.400
- why don't you examine the clues?
- I will.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.280
What's the least humiliating for you -

11:39.280 --> 11:41.200
if I take it down, or I lift you up?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.880
- Taking it down would be better.
- I'll lift you up, then.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.200
How do you reach those magazines on the top shelf?

11:49.440 --> 11:56.080
So, how could this swan tell us who the secret agent is?

11:57.120 --> 11:59.160
Well, what do we know about swans?

11:59.160 --> 12:01.840
Well, a female swan is called a pen.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.040
Perhaps we could use a feather as a clue.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.320
A young swan is a signet, also a type of ring,

12:07.320 --> 12:09.800
which might relate to the handcuffs.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.560
- A mute swan...
- It was Wendy.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.760
- What?
- My dead swan.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.840
Swap the letters around and you get -

12:17.840 --> 12:19.280
Wendy Adams.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.880
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

12:20.880 --> 12:23.920
Well, it's either that or someone called Demys Wanda did it.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.800
It can't be her! Tell them, Wendy!

12:26.800 --> 12:29.520
Frank's right, it was me!

12:29.520 --> 12:31.120
I hate this bloody game.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.640
I got a mysterious e-mail a few days ago saying,

12:35.640 --> 12:38.480
"Your secret mission is to handcuff someone to the bomb.

12:38.480 --> 12:42.240
"If you succeed, your team will be rewarded with an extra clue."

12:42.240 --> 12:45.200
- Well, what clue?
- Once you worked out it was me, I'm supposed to say,

12:45.200 --> 12:47.640
"You need to look where I made my deal".

12:47.640 --> 12:49.680
- Well, what does that mean?
- I've no idea.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.520
Where did you make your deal♪ That's clearly where the next clue is.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.040
Please say a Threshers.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.160
Let's think about this.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.440
If Wendy's agreement was made by e-mail,

13:00.440 --> 13:03.120
well, one might say, on the web. Hm!

13:03.120 --> 13:07.000
Whereabouts is there a web♪ Well, spiders have webs, and...

13:07.000 --> 13:09.520
- Found it!
- Oh, for God's sake!

13:09.520 --> 13:12.080
She made the deal in secret,

13:12.080 --> 13:16.400
which some might say is under the table.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.080
This was stuck under the table.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.160
- Bravo!
- Very good!

13:21.160 --> 13:24.200
Ah, please, come on, this is getting embarrassing.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.160
I'm sure you can handle it.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.120
No, I meant embarrassing for you.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.760
Well, well, well!

13:33.760 --> 13:37.080
If you're watching this, it means you've passed the first test.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.920
Unlike me, thrown on the scrapheap at 45.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.320
But you've got more important things to worry about,

13:43.320 --> 13:45.480
like being handcuffed to a bomb.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.040
Believe me, you don't want to be

13:49.040 --> 13:51.360
within half a mile when that thing goes off.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.720
- See!
- But guess what?

13:53.720 --> 13:57.760
I'm going to be helpful and give you the key to defuse the bomb.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.800
Oh, how wonderfully generous of the mentally unhinged gobshite!

14:00.800 --> 14:03.880
Just pause this tape and break away the plaster

14:03.880 --> 14:05.920
on the left-hand side of the TV

14:05.920 --> 14:08.040
and there you'll find the key.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.360
- Stand back.
- Seriously, stand back.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.480
Toby is useless at DIY.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.360
He once put up some shelves

14:16.360 --> 14:19.160
and accidentally injured me two rooms away.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.000
Accidentally.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.440
Two dolls.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.160
But each of them has got a key.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.160
Which key do we use?

14:38.160 --> 14:41.240
"Which key do we use?" I hear you ask.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.520
Well, that would be telling.

14:43.520 --> 14:48.640
One key defuses the bomb, the other one...detonates it!

14:48.640 --> 14:49.880
Well, which key is which?

14:49.880 --> 14:54.240
"Yeah, but which key is which?" I hear you ask.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.400
Well, that would be telling.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.880
"Oh, just tell us, you irritating twat!"

14:58.880 --> 15:01.240
I hear me ask.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.080
"Can we have another clue?" I hear you ask.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.640
Well, look a little deeper to see the bigger picture

15:07.640 --> 15:10.400
to find which key gives the best result.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.200
- Well, what kind of clue is that?
- Why don't we just guess which key?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.040
What's the worst that can happen?

15:16.040 --> 15:19.680
Er...the bomb could explode in my face and disfigure me for life.

15:19.680 --> 15:23.200
Why don't we just guess which key♪ What's the worst that can happen?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.480
Let's think rationally.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.080
He said to look at the bigger picture.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.560
But there aren't any pictures.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.640
Hang on, yes, there is.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.440
- Where?
- On that first tape.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.120
Remember♪ Earlier, he held up a picture of his wife.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.600
- Clever!
- Well, Dad has a keen eye for other people's wives.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.800
He told us to look closer, so let's do that.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.360
Oh, my God! Look!

15:50.360 --> 15:52.800
- That's weird!
- What is?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.680
Lee, you're in the photograph.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.840
No, I'm not. It's probably someone who just looks like me!

15:57.840 --> 16:01.120
I wish I could tell you it was a Chuckle Brother,

16:01.120 --> 16:02.840
but it's definitely you.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.000
- What's going on?
- Probably just a coincidence.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.360
A coincidence?!

16:09.360 --> 16:13.360
I'm in that photo and I'm trapped in here, strapped to a ticking bomb!

16:13.360 --> 16:16.080
- Is it a wind-up?
- Probably, if it's ticking.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.400
Oh! I get it.

16:19.400 --> 16:23.520
- What?
- You lot, you're all in on this, to freak me out.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.880
- No, we're not.
- If we wanted to scare you,

16:25.880 --> 16:27.840
we wouldn't need to do anything so elaborate.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.240
We'd just take you on the log flume again.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.520
I was the only one without a plastic poncho!

16:35.640 --> 16:38.120
Hang on, this is even odder than we thought.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.280
- Why?
- Because it's not just you in the photo. Toby's in it, too!

16:42.280 --> 16:43.880
What?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.600
That man chatting to Lee, it's you.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.240
- Oh, yeah.
- When was this picture taken?!

16:49.240 --> 16:53.560
Judging by Toby's jeans, I'd say 1983.

16:53.560 --> 16:56.320
Snow-wash will have a revival.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.000
I know exactly where that photograph was taken.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.520
That is my department's Christmas party last year.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.280
Do you remember, Lee, you tagged along for the free food and drink?

17:07.280 --> 17:09.960
Right, this is getting seriously creepy now.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.880
And I know why I recognise that guy now.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.760
I worked with him at the hospital.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.040
- You knew him?
- Well, hardly.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.119
He was in IT, in the department that I joined,

17:19.119 --> 17:21.720
but he left shortly after I'd started.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.359
Left♪ He said on that tape he was sacked.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.200
What exactly was your job in this new department?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.800
- Doctor, of course.
- Anything else?

17:32.800 --> 17:37.800
Well, I was brought in to implement some sort of efficiency programmes.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.320
Which meant a bit of...streamlining.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.720
- You got him the sack?
- Well, I could be mistaken,

17:45.720 --> 17:48.640
it's difficult to remember, with all the staff that come and go.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.840
So all this could be real!

17:49.840 --> 17:52.640
That certainly explains the lack of drink.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.240
Oh, my God!

17:54.240 --> 17:58.840
Excuse me. If you can all rejoin me on planet Earth for a moment?

17:58.840 --> 18:03.600
May I remind you that Lucy chose this experience, not vice versa.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.840
Actually...that's not exactly how it happened.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.640
- What do you mean?
- I didn't contact them, they contacted me.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.360
I got a random e-mail.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.200
It said, "Escape rooms - prices so cheap, we must be mad."

18:17.840 --> 18:21.400
Ooo! Please keep talking, this just gets better and better!

18:21.400 --> 18:23.360
I assume you checked out the company.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.240
They must have had a website or something?

18:25.240 --> 18:28.560
In the e-mail, he said he hadn't had a chance to set one up yet.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.040
Said it was a brand-new experience and that we'd be the first.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.720
He didn't say anything about us being the last, did he?

18:34.720 --> 18:37.960
Look, he's not a maniac, this is all part of the game!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.400
I think.

18:40.400 --> 18:45.000
Of course, it's clearly part of the game, and Lucy's in on it.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.720
- No, I'm not.
- How on earth would this man have got your e-mail address?

18:48.720 --> 18:52.600
He was an IT expert, he could easily have hacked into my work e-mail.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.600
And Lucy's copied in on various group e-mails I receive.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.240
You know, Lee, important ones, like video clips of a drunk man

18:59.240 --> 19:01.960
showing his arse crack at a family barbecue.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.920
That was a very funny clip, actually.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.800
- You didn't send it to me.
- Whose arse do you think it was?

19:10.520 --> 19:12.560
So the man acquired Lucy's address somehow,

19:12.560 --> 19:15.240
but if he wanted to harm Toby, why punish the rest of us?

19:15.240 --> 19:17.680
You heard him on that tape, he's lost everything!

19:17.680 --> 19:19.720
And now he wants Toby to lose everything, too!

19:19.720 --> 19:21.200
Including his close friends!

19:21.200 --> 19:23.720
But me and Geoffrey aren't his close friends!

19:23.720 --> 19:26.360
- No offence, Toby.
- None taken.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.800
- I'm not a close friend either.
- Still no offence.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.560
I wouldn't even say we were particularly close.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.480
Little bit of offence taken there, though.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.720
All that maniac cares about

19:39.720 --> 19:41.840
is that Toby is in here with some of his friends.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.760
He doesn't care about the specifics!

19:43.760 --> 19:46.920
- We're going to die!
- As I recall, you said the same thing last year

19:46.920 --> 19:49.280
on the waltzers at Thorpe Park.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.840
The waltzers were not being operated

19:50.840 --> 19:53.240
by a man with a homicidal grudge against Toby!

19:53.240 --> 19:55.800
It didn't stop you shouting hysterically

19:55.800 --> 19:57.720
at the man spinning you around.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.400
I was just trying to make the point

19:59.400 --> 20:01.280
that "scream if you want to go faster"

20:01.280 --> 20:03.240
is a system that is inherently flawed!

20:07.400 --> 20:10.960
Tell me this, then - if the grudge is against Toby,

20:10.960 --> 20:13.760
why did they not handcuff him to the bomb?

20:13.760 --> 20:16.080
That is a good point.

20:16.080 --> 20:20.000
- Actually...
- I am starting to hate the word "actually"!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.280
I was suppose to handcuff Toby,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.200
that's what it really said in the e-mail.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.520
But in the darkness, I got Lee by mistake.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.240
Well, why didn't you tell us this before?

20:28.240 --> 20:30.760
I was worried I'd got it wrong. I thought they'd stop the game!

20:30.760 --> 20:33.440
Well, why did he let us carry on if you'd broken the rules?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.840
Well, he didn't let us carry on, did he♪ He's not here!

20:35.840 --> 20:38.800
He's probably 50 miles away, waiting for this bomb to explode!

20:38.800 --> 20:42.280
Don't be stupid. He's upstairs with the rest of the game's organisers,

20:42.280 --> 20:44.920
listening in and laughing at your ridiculous rantings!

20:44.920 --> 20:47.600
- Actually...
- Don't you start!

20:47.600 --> 20:49.520
He's not. There's nobody upstairs.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.720
When I turned up, I was desperate for the bog,

20:51.720 --> 20:53.240
so I went searching.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.280
Trust me, we're in a derelict old building in the middle of nowhere.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.800
And you tell us this now?

20:58.800 --> 21:00.600
Well, I don't know how this works, do I?!

21:00.600 --> 21:02.280
I've never done it before!

21:02.280 --> 21:04.040
Normal people celebrate their birthday

21:04.040 --> 21:05.440
by opening a can of Special Brew

21:05.440 --> 21:07.520
and sticking a candle in a Mr Kipling!

21:09.920 --> 21:13.080
There's a poetry to the sadness of your life, isn't there, Frank?

21:14.200 --> 21:15.880
Right, enough is enough!

21:15.880 --> 21:19.080
If this is somebody's idea of an elaborate joke, it's not funny!

21:19.080 --> 21:22.080
So this is your last chance to tell me...right now!

21:22.080 --> 21:25.240
- Well, it's not us.
- Look, I really did work with him at the hospital

21:25.240 --> 21:27.400
and I really could have got him the sack.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
And he really did e-mail me out of the blue, I swear to God!

21:30.000 --> 21:31.480
- Dad?
- Me?

21:31.480 --> 21:32.840
My idea of an elaborate wind-up

21:32.840 --> 21:34.680
is breaking wind when you pull my finger!

21:36.960 --> 21:40.200
- It's not us.
- Wendy and I wouldn't do anything like this.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.680
Seeing you teary last year on Billy Badger's Big Bumpy Boat...

21:48.160 --> 21:49.880
..that was embarrassing enough, Lee.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.480
I wouldn't want to go through all that again.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.000
- Oh, my God, it is real!
- No, it isn't!

21:55.000 --> 21:57.360
Nobody puts a digital timer on a bomb!

21:57.360 --> 22:00.760
Look, it's even got a switch on the back to turn the bloody thing off!

22:05.120 --> 22:06.520
Oh!

22:06.520 --> 22:09.200
Funny how time seems to go faster when you're enjoying yourself.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.600
Oh, good! He's included some dramatic music

22:13.600 --> 22:15.400
because this isn't quite tense enough!

22:15.400 --> 22:19.080
- Geoffrey, what have you done?
- Nothing! It isn't real!

22:19.080 --> 22:21.480
- Is it?
- Yes, it is! We're going to die!

22:21.480 --> 22:23.920
- And it's all my fault!
- None of us are dead yet!

22:23.920 --> 22:27.120
We've still got a chance of solving the puzzles and getting out of here!

22:27.120 --> 22:30.480
Frank, you're the problem-solving genius, which is the right key?

22:30.480 --> 22:33.040
Oh! Er... I don't know!

22:33.040 --> 22:35.760
Oh, you see, when we really need him, he's got nothing!

22:35.760 --> 22:39.280
You're just jealous because I'm better than you at doing mammograms!

22:42.280 --> 22:44.960
The word is anagrams, you imbecile!

22:44.960 --> 22:48.120
Stop it, the pair of you! Now think, and quickly.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.400
The man said, "Look back at the old clues."

22:50.400 --> 22:52.840
Yes, and we did that, and we made the connection to Toby.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.680
But how does that help us now?

22:54.680 --> 22:58.320
Well, last time, when we worked out that Wendy was the secret agent,

22:58.320 --> 23:00.000
it was linked to the swan.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.360
This time, it might link Toby to the dolls.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.320
Yeah, but we don't have an anagram this time,

23:04.320 --> 23:06.080
we only have the letters A and B.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.400
All right, all right, all right, let's think about this.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.000
Two Victorian dolls, each with a key,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.640
both made of fine biscuit porcelain.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.720
What do we know about fine biscuit porcelain?!

23:13.720 --> 23:15.240
- Got it!
- You can't have!

23:17.720 --> 23:19.080
- I have! It's, er...
- Don't!

23:19.080 --> 23:21.440
Don't...don't say it, just give me a minute!

23:21.440 --> 23:24.320
You what?!

23:24.320 --> 23:26.040
You'll be kicking yourselves.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.840
I'll be bloody kicking you if you don't say it!

23:28.840 --> 23:30.760
Oh, for God's sake, just spit it out!

23:30.760 --> 23:33.880
It's an anagram of Toby - Toy B.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.440
Goddamn it!

23:40.800 --> 23:42.280
Wait! What are you doing?!

23:42.280 --> 23:44.240
It's the key from Toy B.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.800
The man said, "Choose the key which gives the best result,"

23:46.800 --> 23:48.360
but the best result for who?!

23:48.360 --> 23:51.000
The best result for him is if we blow ourselves up!

23:51.000 --> 23:54.280
- So, do you think I should use the other key?
- I don't know!

23:54.280 --> 23:56.240
Quickly!

24:11.680 --> 24:14.920
Well, I don't know about anyone else, but I thoroughly enjoyed that.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.640
Perhaps you're all now willing to accept that this was just a game.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.480
Bit of a coincidence, that man being a colleague of Toby's,

24:23.480 --> 24:25.400
whether Toby got him the sack or not.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.960
Well, flukes happen all the time.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.320
I mean, look at Frank, solving all those clues.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.920
Now, can we go to the pub, please?

24:32.920 --> 24:35.560
Well, not quite. We still have to find a way to uncuff me.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.960
And open the door.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.520
Oh, well, the door's an easy one,

24:38.520 --> 24:40.560
that's obviously what Key B is for. Toby?

24:45.360 --> 24:46.960
It fits.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.240
What's going on?!

24:59.240 --> 25:01.560
- Oh, my God!
- Open the door!

25:01.560 --> 25:03.720
I can't! It won't open!

25:05.360 --> 25:08.320
Looks like you passed the test, Toby, but who cares?

25:08.320 --> 25:11.200
I hate tests, and I hate you!

25:11.200 --> 25:12.280
You know, most people

25:12.280 --> 25:14.760
would just have stopped sending Christmas cards!

25:16.360 --> 25:18.920
You're going to regret getting me sacked, Toby.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.880
We're all going to die!

25:20.880 --> 25:23.080
For once in your life, Toby, do something!

25:23.080 --> 25:25.080
Oh, don't you worry - if I get out of here alive,

25:25.080 --> 25:27.320
I'm going to have some pretty harsh things to say

25:27.320 --> 25:29.520
about all of this on TripAdvisor!

25:31.240 --> 25:33.360
It's going to blow!

25:38.280 --> 25:40.280
Prepare to die!

25:49.160 --> 25:51.720
# Happy birthday to me

25:51.720 --> 25:53.960
# It was hilarious to see

25:53.960 --> 25:57.840
# You all hide from a pretend bomb

25:57.840 --> 26:00.120
♪ That was put there by me. ♪

26:08.560 --> 26:10.440
Hip-hip!

26:10.440 --> 26:13.000
No?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.760
So, are you saying you arranged all this, Lee?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.280
Yep!

26:17.280 --> 26:19.600
With more than a little help from Greg.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.480
Who the hell's Greg?

26:21.480 --> 26:23.520
The IT bloke from Toby's work.

26:23.520 --> 26:26.120
I got chatting to him at that Christmas party last year.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.320
Told me that he'd handed his notice in.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.320
- So, Toby didn't get him sacked?
- Nope!

26:31.320 --> 26:34.120
He was leaving anyway, to start his own business -

26:34.120 --> 26:37.240
- escape rooms.
- You got him to e-mail Lucy.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.560
See, Geoffrey, you can get the clues when they're a little bit easier.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.360
So, how did you know I'd sign up for it?

26:44.360 --> 26:46.920
Because, Lucy, I knew, like every year,

26:46.920 --> 26:49.960
that you would leave my birthday arrangements until the last minute

26:49.960 --> 26:51.160
and sign up to anything.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.680
I was just a bit surprised you did it without a Wowcher being involved.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.840
- They're in my pocket, by the way.
- What are?

26:58.840 --> 27:01.960
The keys. They've been there the whole time.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.800
Big one opens the padlock on the door,

27:03.800 --> 27:06.200
little one opens the handcuffs.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.000
Why♪ Why go to all this effort?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.440
Because, Geoffrey, perhaps now

27:10.440 --> 27:12.480
we've got a different topic of conversation

27:12.480 --> 27:15.760
other than how scared I was last year at Thorpe Park.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.000
You scared us all senseless for that?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.520
Here's us thinking we've been lured here by a madman

27:22.520 --> 27:24.120
hell-bent on revenge.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.560
When all along, we've been lured here

27:26.560 --> 27:28.840
by a madman hell-bent on revenge.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.040
Come on, everyone, pub.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.200
Er...aren't you forgetting something?

27:33.200 --> 27:35.560
Aren't you going to unlock me?

27:35.560 --> 27:37.560
See if you can solve this riddle -

27:37.560 --> 27:40.720
My first is in "never" and "no chance" and "no".

27:40.720 --> 27:43.480
The second is in "bollocks to you".

27:45.400 --> 27:48.000
Hang on! You can't just leave me here!

27:48.000 --> 27:49.840
Come on, Lucy, it was only a bit of fun!

27:49.840 --> 27:53.200
Oh, well, lucky you! You get to enjoy it for several more hours.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.280
Are you winding me up?

27:59.120 --> 28:00.800
Ha!

28:03.080 --> 28:04.960
No!

28:06.320 --> 28:07.840
Well, some people can't take a joke.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.520
# We're not going out

28:14.520 --> 28:16.120

28:16.120 --> 28:19.240
# Just hanging around with my head in a spin

28:19.240 --> 28:22.240
# But there is no need to scream and shout
