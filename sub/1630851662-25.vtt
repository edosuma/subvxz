[people groaning]

00:27.944 --> 00:29.654
[agony scream]

00:34.743 --> 00:36.411
Ookir<i> [Father].</i> Jeju<i> [Mother].</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.249
The Galaxy is yours.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.128
You claim to be our son?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.380
Yes. I have come
from the distant future

00:47.464 --> 00:49.215
to free you
from the Phantom Zone.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.925
There is much to explain,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.303
but you should know
that 40 years ago,
Rao exploded,

00:53.386 --> 00:54.679
taking Krypton with it.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.474
But Krypton lives on
in the House of Zod,

00:57.557 --> 00:59.642
and you, General Dru-Zod,

00:59.726 --> 01:04.147
are destined
to unite this Galaxy
under your rule.

01:04.230 --> 01:08.777
Not long ago,
the Phantom Zone Projector
sought to draw me out.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.612
That was me.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.490
But you see before you
warriors determined
to thwart my efforts

01:13.573 --> 01:18.912
and your destiny in order
to keep you trapped in
the living death of the Zone.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.331
And you see that,
as your loyal son,

01:21.414 --> 01:25.585
I have gathered the resources
to bring them all low.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.003
Even this one.

01:27.086 --> 01:31.341
-[groaning]
-Kal-El,
the so called Superman.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.010
Last survivor
of the House of El.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.180
Some of what you say
tallies with
what we already know.

01:37.263 --> 01:42.393
But if you are truly our son,
speak the Secret Maxim
of the House of Zod.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.230
"From the will comes strength.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.149
From strength comes the will."

01:48.233 --> 01:49.901
He is our son.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.111
Of course, he's our son, Dru.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.196
[sighing emotionally]

01:54.155 --> 01:55.907
[Ursa] He has your eyes.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.742
Follow me,

01:57.826 --> 02:01.329
and I will bring you to a world
under a yellow sun

02:01.412 --> 02:05.208
that will grant both of you
power unimaginable.

02:05.291 --> 02:10.839
And with that power
will come the true ascension
of the House of Zod.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.346
[theme music playing]

02:48.668 --> 02:51.462
[grunting]

02:51.546 --> 02:53.840
Go back through the Boomtube.
Organize the others.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.259
Gather every Zone inmate
from the other Forts.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.428
Bring my Army back
through this portal.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.637
As you command.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.390
[grunting]

03:05.643 --> 03:06.853
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

[groans]

03:07.937 --> 03:08.771
[grunts]

03:09.814 --> 03:11.316
What just-- How did she--

03:11.399 --> 03:12.400
<i>Damn it.</i>

03:12.483 --> 03:13.902
<i>The Lantern's will is strong.</i>

03:13.985 --> 03:15.653
<i>My brain-blast</i>
<i>barely phased her,</i>

03:15.737 --> 03:17.780
<i>and the Mother-Thrall</i>
<i>cannot contain her for long.</i>

03:17.864 --> 03:20.241
<i>-You should--</i>
-My parents
are vulnerable here.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.910
Get us back to Earth, now!

03:21.993 --> 03:23.745
<i>As you wish.</i>

03:23.828 --> 03:26.873
<i>But Mother-Thrall</i>
<i>can only create</i>
<i>one Boomtube at a time.</i>

03:26.956 --> 03:28.291
You have your orders!

03:31.544 --> 03:32.629
[Mother-Thrall ping-beeps]

03:34.339 --> 03:36.007
Those are
the General's orders--

03:39.177 --> 03:41.971
[Tigress exhales]
<i>Well, that takes care</i>
<i>of that problem.</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:45.058
[Rocket]<i> Yeah. I thought</i>
<i>we'd have to fight off</i>
<i>an entire Kryptonian Army</i>

03:45.141 --> 03:46.392
<i>to keep 'em out</i>
<i>of that Boomtube.</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:48.645
[Nightwing]<i> Z, time to go.</i>

03:48.728 --> 03:50.855
[Mother-Thrall ping-beeps]

03:50.939 --> 03:54.609
Wait! We will not flee!
We still have people
in the Zone!

03:54.692 --> 03:57.445
And we'll get them all out
once you're secure.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.571
Trust me, Father.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.249
[grunts]

04:11.918 --> 04:13.670
[groaning continues]

04:17.173 --> 04:18.633
[grunting]

04:28.226 --> 04:30.687
[wind howling]

04:30.770 --> 04:31.854
[Boomtube opens inside]

04:42.532 --> 04:43.825
[Dru-Zod] Where are we?

04:43.908 --> 04:45.827
[Lor-Zod laughs]

04:45.910 --> 04:49.914
I thought it appropriate
to take possession
of the Fortress of our enemy,

04:49.998 --> 04:53.501
Earth's Superman, Kal-El,

04:53.584 --> 04:55.586
son of Lara and Jor-El.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.630
[Superboy moans]

05:00.425 --> 05:01.718
[Lor-Zod] He is alive.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.387
Well, not for long.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.014
[Dru-Zod] Stop.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.599
Father, you don't understand.
This is Kon-El, your enemy.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.645
And look, this world's
yellow sun
already begins to heal him.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.566
We must kill him now,
before he recovers
his invulnerability.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.693
I have turned this Superboy.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.737
Now, his loyalty
is only to Zod.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.406
-But--
-My son, do you challenge
the word of Zod?

05:23.489 --> 05:26.159
No. No, of course not.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.286
Calm yourself, husband.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.080
All children test their elders.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.666
Ah, your touch,

05:33.750 --> 05:38.254
your actual physical touch
could calm a Devourer.

05:38.337 --> 05:43.468
It is wonderful
to be real again.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.136
It's more than that.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.429
I feel better.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.723
Stronger than I ever have.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.516
That's Earth's yellow sun.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.310
After being under
Trombus' red sun,

05:52.393 --> 05:55.605
I'm not yet at my peak,
but I can still do this.

05:59.275 --> 06:01.194
That should prevent
any interference.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.113
Now, please.
Step inside these devices.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.326
They are solar pods
that will hasten
your ascendancy to true power.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.619
First things first.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.329
Reopen the portal to the Zone.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.122
We need to get my people out.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.625
We need the Army
of the House of Zod.

06:16.667 --> 06:17.668
[Mother-Thrall ping-beeps]

06:19.545 --> 06:23.925
Now, let us claim our power.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.469
[Zatanna]<i> One school-bus portal</i>

06:26.552 --> 06:28.096
[Boomtube opens]

06:28.179 --> 06:30.348
[Kaldur]
<i>The Boomtube has reopened.</i>

06:30.431 --> 06:33.101
[Zatanna]<i> So first a Boomtube</i>
<i>opens, then it closes,</i>
<i>then it opens again?</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.520
[Tigress]
<i>And we come here</i>
<i>to get Superboy.</i>

06:35.603 --> 06:36.562
<i>He won't go with us.</i>

06:36.646 --> 06:38.439
<i>And then he leaves without us?</i>

06:38.523 --> 06:41.234
[Rocket]
<i>Yeah, I'm really getting</i>
<i>to hate the Phantom Zone.</i>

06:41.317 --> 06:42.944
[Nightwing]<i> Mother of Goat.</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:45.446
<i>All right, come on.</i>
<i>Job to do.</i>

06:45.530 --> 06:47.865
I told you the General
would come through.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.034
Now, go! Gather his army!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.037
[groaning]

06:56.290 --> 06:57.416
Kid Flash?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.335
-Are you all right?
-[grunts]

06:59.418 --> 07:01.712
[grunts] Yeah, fine, big guy.
Just feeling
a little<i> inhibited,</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:02.839
if you know what I mean.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.840
Oh, right.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.175
[grunts]

07:06.259 --> 07:07.218
Ah-ha!

07:07.301 --> 07:08.928
Thanks. BRB. Peow!

07:09.011 --> 07:12.098
-Where the hell's he going?
-We'll find out soon enough.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.349
Miss Martian.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.309
Conner is alive.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.103
And he's in so much pain.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.938
Physical and emotional.

07:19.021 --> 07:23.359
Even while we were
being tortured by my brother,
I could feel it.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.486
Clark, he's so lost.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.364
He's regressed to his base
Cadmus programming.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.700
Meaning he's back
to thinking
he's just a weapon?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.619
Meaning he's a loose cannon
under enemy control.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.787
I<i> need</i> to find him.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.248
We need to
get back to Earth.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.584
Closest planet
under a yellow sun.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.960
That's where they'd go.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.212
We've lost Motherbox.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.299
There will be no Boomtube.

07:46.382 --> 07:50.052
But perhaps Green Lantern
can take us through subspace.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.721
[Kid Flash] Hello, Megan!

07:51.804 --> 07:53.139
She will have some help.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.521
[Glamour warps]

08:00.605 --> 08:01.439
Look.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.567
[Zatanna]<i> Damn it.</i>

08:04.650 --> 08:06.068
<i>The Boomtube</i>
<i>warped my glamour.</i>
<i>I couldn't hold it.</i>

08:06.152 --> 08:07.862
[Kaldur]
<i>Then we must hold the door.</i>

08:07.945 --> 08:09.363
Move, Soldiers of Zod!

08:10.323 --> 08:13.242
You shall not pass!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.620
<i>Huh. I bet he's always</i>
<i>wanted to say that.</i>

08:15.703 --> 08:17.788
[laughs]<i> I always</i>
<i>wanted to say that.</i>

08:17.872 --> 08:20.625
<i>Focus. Do not forget</i>
<i>that they defeated us before.</i>
<i>And handily.</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:24.170
<i>For the sake of the galaxy,</i>
<i>we cannot let them</i>
<i>defeat us again.</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:29.759
[laughs]

08:29.842 --> 08:32.470
Forager's warp-field
is so crash!

08:32.553 --> 08:34.639
I'm running fast,
so Bio-Ship can run faster,

08:34.722 --> 08:38.434
and now Forager's breaking
all modes to get us back
to Earth even faster still!

08:38.517 --> 08:40.603
<i>Thank you, Bio-Ship.</i>

08:40.686 --> 08:44.524
<i>It means worlds to me that</i>
<i>you've foregone your retirement</i>
<i>for Conner's sake.</i>

08:44.607 --> 08:46.442
[Saturn Girl]
<i>You really did it.</i>

08:46.525 --> 08:48.778
<i>You really saved Superboy!</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:54.742
<i>I'm afraid I... we...</i>
<i>haven't quite saved him yet.</i>

08:54.825 --> 08:59.622
<i>Maybe not, but after</i>
<i>spending months believing</i>
<i>we'd failed and lost you both,</i>

08:59.705 --> 09:02.959
<i>it's a miracle to learn</i>
<i>there's at least now hope.</i>

09:03.042 --> 09:06.629
[Chameleon Boy]<i> But...</i>
<i>should we be involving</i>
<i>these heroes?</i>

09:06.712 --> 09:09.298
<i>We're putting the timestream</i>
<i>at real risk.</i>

09:09.382 --> 09:13.010
<i>With Zod free,</i>
<i>that's the least</i>
<i>of our worries.</i>

09:21.519 --> 09:23.354
How you doing?

09:23.437 --> 09:27.483
Learning there are
other survivors from Krypton
must be an adjustment.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.154
You know, I've wished for this
my whole life.

09:32.238 --> 09:37.785
But now the very thing
I've wished for is putting
the entire galaxy at risk.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.788
Honestly, I... I have no idea
what I'm feeling.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.624
Except this.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.167
I'm relieved Conner's alive.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.129
And right now our focus
needs to be on saving him.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.423
Kid Flash, have you heard
from Zatanna or Nightwing?

09:50.506 --> 09:53.134
Last time I saw them,
they were looking for you.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.510
Well, they never found me.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.886
<i>No clue where they are now.</i>

10:07.440 --> 10:10.067

<i>Thanks, Z!</i>

[Zatanna]<i> Happy to help.</i>

10:21.996 --> 10:23.706
[Nightwing]<i> Not that</i>
<i>this isn't asterous, but</i>
<i>someone needs to find out</i>

10:23.789 --> 10:24.957
<i>what's at the other end</i>

10:25.041 --> 10:26.042
[Tigress]<i> Go. We've got this.</i>

10:26.125 --> 10:27.418
[Nightwing]<i> Okay, then.</i>

10:27.501 --> 10:28.961

-[Rocket]<i> Very.</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:29.879

10:34.592 --> 10:38.137
I have never felt
like this before.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.348
It is akin to miraculous.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.981
No! [grunts]

So much power
yet so much more to gain.

11:36.570 --> 11:40.449
Ah! The process
was interrupted
before its peak!

[Lor-Zod] Patience, Mother.

After 40 years
in the Phantom Zone, do not
speak to me of patience!

11:47.248 --> 11:50.459
I have endured helplessness
for too long.

11:50.543 --> 11:55.506
In any just universe,
the true power I've tasted here
would be mine by right!

12:32.668 --> 12:33.961
[grunting]

12:37.673 --> 12:40.551
Kryptonians, build your rage!

12:41.510 --> 12:43.179
Build your rage!

12:43.262 --> 12:45.598
[grunting furiously]

12:45.681 --> 12:48.476
Build your rage!

12:48.559 --> 12:51.353
You're not the only ones
getting angry here!

12:53.939 --> 12:55.733
I should hope not.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.862
Now, Soldiers of Zod,
still your hearts,
as the General taught you!

12:59.945 --> 13:01.614
[creature roaring]

13:05.409 --> 13:06.952
[screeching]

13:07.995 --> 13:09.038
[Rocket] What the--

13:09.121 --> 13:11.248
-What is that thing?
-No idea.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.293
[Tigress] Whatever it is,
at least it's blocking
the entrance.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.003
[Faora Hu-Ul]
You cannot win, Earthers.

13:16.086 --> 13:19.715
For you do not understand
the ways of the Zone.

13:19.798 --> 13:23.511
Of course!
Within the Boomtube,
the old rules still apply!

13:24.803 --> 13:26.263
[Faora Hu-Ul] No!

13:26.347 --> 13:29.725
I was sentenced to five years!
I've been here over 40!

13:29.808 --> 13:31.644
It isn't right!

13:31.727 --> 13:35.147
Our offer still stands.
We will consider parole.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.106
[grunting]

13:38.484 --> 13:40.361
The time for patience
has passed!

13:40.444 --> 13:41.737
[screams]

13:46.408 --> 13:47.993
[Dru-Zod] What sorcery is this?

13:48.077 --> 13:49.870
Sorcery, indeed, Father.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.580
This is the Eye of Ekron,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.375
one of the most powerful
mystic weapons
of the 31st century,

13:54.458 --> 13:58.671
wielded in that era by a woman
known as the Emerald Empress.

13:58.754 --> 14:02.925
And this Eye has chosen me?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.176
[Lor-Zod] Who better?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.595
Who could possibly
be more worthy?

14:06.679 --> 14:10.891
No one but Ursa Zod,
the new Emerald Empress.

14:10.975 --> 14:15.688
Still, we cannot allow
ourselves to be distracted,
even by this good fortune.

14:15.771 --> 14:19.024
It's not hard to guess that
this one's four companions

14:19.108 --> 14:22.611
are the reason our people
haven't come through
the Boomtube.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.488
Leave that to me.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.282
<i>Beware, Lor-Zod,</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:29.493
<i>Boomtubes were not designed</i>
<i>to remain open forever.</i>

14:29.577 --> 14:31.954
Maintain control of that thing
and keep it open.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.832
<i>It's not about control,</i>
<i>it's about physics.</i>

14:34.915 --> 14:36.500
<i>You won't have much time.</i>

14:36.584 --> 14:37.418
[grunts]

14:41.380 --> 14:42.965
-[Miss Martian] We're here.
-[Kid Flash laughs]

14:43.048 --> 14:45.843
[sighs] I Love
that Big Blue Marble!

14:45.926 --> 14:47.469
Searching for Boomtube spikes.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.306
Here, a substantial signal.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.557
What is that place?

14:51.640 --> 14:53.183
My Fortress of Solitude.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.894
The enemy has invaded
<i>your</i> sanctum?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.229
Maybe don't rub it in.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.439
[Superman sighs]

14:58.522 --> 15:00.858
The Fortress
has external sensors.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.319
When we get close,
it will alert
whomever's inside.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.323
Bio-Ship has already
interfaced with the Fortress'
Kryptonian systems.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.866
They'll never see us coming.

15:10.492 --> 15:11.285
[roars]

15:11.368 --> 15:12.244
[screaming]

15:15.914 --> 15:19.710
We make our stand here,
where our weapons
and limbs are solid.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.003
Incoming, on our six!

15:23.589 --> 15:26.175
There. That should stop
traffic both ways.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.929
Stop, fools! You're only
strengthening her field!

15:33.932 --> 15:38.228
Okay, his heat vision
is going to become
a problem very soon.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.276
What are you trying to tell me?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.706
[Mother-Thrall ping-beeps]

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
<i>It is as I feared.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:01.627
<i>The Mother-Thrall</i>
<i>can no longer maintain</i>
<i>the Boomtube.</i>

16:01.710 --> 16:03.212
<i>It's losing cohesion.</i>

16:04.213 --> 16:05.673
<i>Lor! Time is up!</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:06.632
[Conner groaning]

16:09.051 --> 16:12.054
[Dru-Zod]
The Boomtube is collapsing!

16:12.137 --> 16:15.474
Uh, what happens
if we're inside of a Boomtube
when it collapses?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.851
I'm betting
we don't want to find out.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.937
The portal fails! Move!

16:20.020 --> 16:23.482
-[Dru-Zod] Lor-Zod! Now!
That's an order!
-[grunting]

16:24.566 --> 16:25.567
Get us out of here, Z.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.069
<i>Mutrap a latrop!</i>

16:27.152 --> 16:28.237
[Kaldur] Move!

16:28.320 --> 16:30.072
-Rocket--
-Go! I'm right behind you!

16:34.284 --> 16:35.202
[gasps]

16:36.870 --> 16:37.830
Rocket.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.969
Prepare to engage.

16:57.641 --> 16:58.809
It's not possible!

16:58.892 --> 16:59.852
<i>Listen--</i>

17:13.198 --> 17:14.074
I knew it.

17:17.035 --> 17:18.120
I've killed her.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.789
[Superman grunts]

17:26.628 --> 17:29.131
In truth,
I'd prefer not to fight you.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.302
Though you are a son of El,

17:33.385 --> 17:37.097
you are also a son of Krypton,

17:37.181 --> 17:40.142
which makes you
a rare commodity.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.686
Kneel before Zod, Kal-El,

17:42.770 --> 17:45.773
and together
we can turn this Earth

17:45.856 --> 17:49.985
into a paradise of strength
for what remains of our people.

17:50.068 --> 17:50.903
Pass.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.155
As you wish.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.825
[groans]

17:56.909 --> 17:58.327
Well...

17:58.410 --> 18:00.621
it seems you're on your knees
before me, after all.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.291
Kon-El...

18:05.042 --> 18:07.002
Conner, help me.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.630
-Hold your place, boy.
-It's all right.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.465
-I can't help him.
-Why?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.176
Because you're already dead.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.762
[groaning]

18:16.845 --> 18:19.890
Do you see, Father,
they are House of El.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.935
That one's your enemy,
and this one doesn't know
his own mind.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.353
We must kill them both.

18:24.978 --> 18:25.896
No.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.190
I have a better idea.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.989
[people gasping]

18:42.746 --> 18:43.831
[man gasps]

18:45.290 --> 18:46.583
[indistinct scream]

18:46.667 --> 18:48.627
[people clamoring]

18:55.467 --> 18:57.344
[people screaming]

19:12.234 --> 19:15.737
People of Earth,
I am General Zod.

19:15.821 --> 19:19.283
And on the basis of my will
and my strength,

19:19.366 --> 19:25.956
I lay claim to this world
in the name of Krypton
and the House of Zod.

19:26.039 --> 19:30.085
Do not look for succor
from terrestrial forces.

19:30.168 --> 19:33.130
Here are your greatest heroes,

19:33.213 --> 19:36.133
Superman and Superboy,

19:36.216 --> 19:40.220
both Sons of Krypton,
who betrayed their homeworld.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.264
One has already fallen,

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
the other has wisely chosen
to serve...

19:47.477 --> 19:49.396
at my side.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.107
-Is that really Superboy?
-I thought he was dead.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.901
What's wrong with Superman?

19:53.984 --> 20:00.574
Watch, as I order
this loyal follower
to slay his only brother.

20:00.657 --> 20:05.954
You are the weapon created
to slay the Superman,
should he turn from the light.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.664
Prove your loyalty, my son.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.126
Prove you are loyal
to the House of Zod.

20:11.209 --> 20:14.463
Kal-El has turned away
from the light of Krypton.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.924
Finish the work you started.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.759
<i>We have nothing here.</i>

20:18.842 --> 20:20.469
<i>Nothing but each other.</i>

20:20.552 --> 20:22.304
<i>It helps to stay together.</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:25.599
<i>Stay and be a part</i>
<i>of what the House of Zod</i>
<i>builds.</i>

20:27.643 --> 20:29.144
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

20:29.227 --> 20:30.646
[Ursa]
<i>That's what family does.</i>

20:30.729 --> 20:32.940
[Dru-Zod]<i> Come on, my boy.</i>
<i>One more jump.</i>

20:35.025 --> 20:36.026
<i>Whom do you serve?</i>

20:37.319 --> 20:38.820
[Superboy]
<i>I serve the House of Zod.</i>

20:38.904 --> 20:39.905
[Kaldur] Conner, stop!

20:41.073 --> 20:41.949
Prove it!

20:43.116 --> 20:43.951
[grunts]

20:46.328 --> 20:47.746
[Dru-Zod] On my signal...

20:49.206 --> 20:51.458
at my command.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.460
And once this is done,
Earthers,

20:53.543 --> 20:57.798
you will see that
all must kneel before Zod.
