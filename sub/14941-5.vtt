WEBVTT

00:08.109 --> 00:11.112
(Panting)

00:20.321 --> 00:22.653
H-Help me.

00:26.497 --> 00:29.259
(Emergency vehicle horn honks)

00:29.260 --> 00:31.261
(Siren whoops)

00:31.262 --> 00:33.663
(Police radio chatter)

00:33.664 --> 00:36.506
Liberty mall. You know
what they have there?

00:36.507 --> 00:38.268
What? A shark.

00:38.269 --> 00:40.270
Why in the world
would you know that?

00:40.271 --> 00:42.512
Northeast general is a
couple blocks from here.

00:42.513 --> 00:45.515
Whenever I used to operate,
I'd come visit the shark.

00:45.516 --> 00:47.817
Oh, communing with
one of your own, huh?

00:47.818 --> 00:51.081
I'm kinder and gentler now.
(Chuckles) Oh, yeah, right.

00:51.082 --> 00:53.153
I am. Good morning, detective.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.155
Good morning, Dr. Hunt.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.357
Peter. (Camera shutter clicking)

00:57.358 --> 01:00.260
What have we got, Sam?

01:00.261 --> 01:03.193
Well, a couple of shoppers
found the body, called it in.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.195
There's no I.D. On him.

01:05.196 --> 01:07.597
I'm thinking it's a
mugging gone wrong.

01:07.598 --> 01:09.469
A man was seen hurrying away

01:09.470 --> 01:11.701
from the scene
carrying a duffel bag.

01:11.702 --> 01:14.374
African-American, 30s, low-riding
jeans, tats. Security cameras?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.106
(Chuckles) That
would be too easy.

01:16.107 --> 01:19.078
So the guy gets hit on the
head, and he comes over the rail.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.511
I see multiple cuts and
scratches from the bushes,

01:21.512 --> 01:24.684
but I don't see anything
bad enough to kill him.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.257
What are you
looking for? A pulse.

01:27.258 --> 01:30.260
I think it's safe to say, by
the time you get the call,

01:30.261 --> 01:33.763
he's already dead. You don't want to
know some of the mistakes I've seen.

01:33.764 --> 01:36.796
Detective! Found it on
the street two blocks away.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.870
No cash or credit cards.
He left the driver's license.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.435
Ted harbison.
Callowhill street. Age 35.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.877
Let me see that.

01:47.878 --> 01:49.739
(Sniffs)

01:49.740 --> 01:52.312
Is there a cheesesteak
place around here?

01:52.313 --> 01:54.414
(Chuckles) Yeah, probably. Why?

01:54.415 --> 01:55.845
(Sniffs)

01:55.846 --> 01:58.248
That's cheesesteak cheese.

01:58.249 --> 02:00.320
(Sam) How many
cheesesteak places

02:00.321 --> 02:04.155
can there be in
one neighborhood?

02:05.856 --> 02:07.897
Here's your order.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.359
Thank you.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.301
(Bell on door jingles)

02:11.302 --> 02:13.833
What can I get you, officers?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.765
Detective. Sorry.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.268
You seen an African-American
guy around here...

02:18.269 --> 02:21.771
30s, baggy jeans,
tattoos on his arms?

02:21.772 --> 02:23.744
Carl! Get out here!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.317
Go!

02:27.318 --> 02:28.678
(Objects clatter)

02:28.679 --> 02:30.551
(Grunts)

02:34.385 --> 02:35.885
What's her name?

02:35.886 --> 02:37.887
(Curtis) Jessica Archer, age 33.

02:37.888 --> 02:40.390
Died in her sleep
in her hotel room.

02:40.391 --> 02:43.463
(Sighs) What a waste.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.164
Cause of death?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.466
This.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.167
Saddle embolism

02:48.168 --> 02:50.470
blocking the left and right
main pulmonary arteries.

02:50.471 --> 02:53.373
It's as thick as your finger.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.874
She's young,

02:54.875 --> 02:57.707
her valves are normal,
and she looks healthy.

02:57.708 --> 03:01.252
So how'd she get a blood
clot the size of a hot dog?

03:07.888 --> 03:09.389
Carl Anders,

03:09.390 --> 03:12.222
member of the
Bronson street gang.

03:12.223 --> 03:13.523
Ex-member.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.225
Mm. Current or ex,

03:15.226 --> 03:17.527
causing a death in the
commission of a robbery

03:17.528 --> 03:19.229
is Criminally
negligent homicide.

03:19.230 --> 03:21.231
Look, I didn't Rob
nobody, a'ight?

03:21.232 --> 03:23.933
I went on my break.
That's it. Mm. (Chuckles)

03:23.934 --> 03:26.406
And you expect me to
believe a poor ex-gangbanger

03:26.407 --> 03:28.938
like you, hmm? It's true.

03:28.939 --> 03:31.911
Ted harbison's credit
cards. Explain that.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.545
I saw a bag on
the ground. I took it.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.548
And you didn't see the
guy you took it from?

03:38.549 --> 03:41.551
I saw a guy. He was up
ahead of me, kinda weaving.

03:41.552 --> 03:44.454
Weaving? (Chuckles) Know what I'm
saying? Like he was drunk or something.

03:44.455 --> 03:46.456
He ducked down some stairs.

03:46.457 --> 03:48.658
By the time I got
there, he was gone.

03:48.659 --> 03:50.930
The bag was on the
ground, so I took it,

03:50.931 --> 03:52.932
but I didn't see no
body in the bushes.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.465
(Scoffs)

03:56.767 --> 03:59.238
I do not see any evidence

03:59.239 --> 04:00.910
of physical trauma.

04:00.911 --> 04:03.913
What else did they
find in that bag of his?

04:03.914 --> 04:06.245
Toiletries,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.017
two issues of "certified
accountant" magazine,

04:08.018 --> 04:10.019
private pilot logbooks

04:10.020 --> 04:11.981
and flight maps,

04:11.982 --> 04:16.025
prescriptions for Vicodin
and promethazine.

04:16.026 --> 04:17.857
What's promethazine?

04:17.858 --> 04:20.530
It's prescribed post-op
for nausea and vomiting.

04:20.531 --> 04:22.532
Is there a doctor listed?

04:22.533 --> 04:24.964
Dr. Mark Chandler.
Northeast general hospital.

04:24.965 --> 04:28.738
Those are porthole incisions.
This guy just had surgery.

04:28.739 --> 04:31.341
Let's get his clothes off.
Move that light, will you?

04:31.342 --> 04:32.843
Sure.

04:37.748 --> 04:40.049
So tell me something.
They let you just walk

04:40.050 --> 04:42.712
out of the hospital right
after surgery? Not right after.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.985
He probably went in
first thing this morning.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.358
The whole idea is to
shorten recovery time.

04:48.359 --> 04:51.290
Four little holes... That
one's for the scope,

04:51.291 --> 04:53.563
these two are for
the instruments,

04:53.564 --> 04:55.965
and that one's for whatever
they took out of him.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.967
By the location, I
would say... gallbladder.

04:57.968 --> 05:01.672
But that's just routine, right?

05:03.434 --> 05:04.934
Hey, you okay?

05:04.935 --> 05:06.436
Your paresthesia acting up?

05:06.437 --> 05:09.609
I am fine.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.513
Let's see what's
going on in him.

05:27.558 --> 05:29.960
Why is his abdomen
full of blood?

05:32.963 --> 05:35.435
You can tell Sam that a mugger

05:35.436 --> 05:38.439
did not kill Ted harbison.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.813
His surgeon did.

05:44.114 --> 05:48.048
(Fabric snaps)

05:55.386 --> 05:57.957
(Woman) Ted passed
a gallstone last year.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.030
Anyone who's ever done it
will tell you, one is enough.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.032
When his symptoms
started up again,

06:03.033 --> 06:06.035
we found a surgeon right away.

06:06.036 --> 06:07.867
It wasn't the surgery, was it?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.500
We're looking into
every possibility.

06:10.501 --> 06:13.403
Can you tell me
why he was alone?

06:13.404 --> 06:16.105
Hospitals don't normally
release post-op patients

06:16.106 --> 06:18.578
without an escort.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.580
(Voice breaking)
After surgery, Ted said

06:20.581 --> 06:22.582
he'd be fine in recovery,

06:22.583 --> 06:25.655
and I should just
come back after work.

06:25.656 --> 06:28.918
I had no idea he was
gonna sneak out by himself.

06:28.919 --> 06:32.622
(Crying) If only I'd stayed.

06:32.623 --> 06:35.625
(Sobs)

06:35.626 --> 06:37.797
Your husband was an accountant?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.699
Yes.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.000
Because we found, uh,

06:41.001 --> 06:43.002
pilot logbooks and
flight maps in his duffel.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.104
I don't know too
many accountant pilots.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.106
He wasn't a pilot really.

06:47.107 --> 06:50.880
He had not flown since
the day he got his license.

06:50.881 --> 06:52.882
Then why did he get his license?

06:52.883 --> 06:56.145
To overcome his fear of
flying. That's Ted, you see.

06:56.146 --> 06:59.088
Mr. Sensible. If he
got caught in the rain

06:59.089 --> 07:02.021
in a nice pair of shoes,
he'd take his shoes off.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.724
Easier to clean feet
than shoes. (Chuckles)

07:04.725 --> 07:05.996
(Sniffles)

07:07.498 --> 07:09.959
Mrs. Harbison, I promise you,

07:09.960 --> 07:13.002
we're gonna find out what
happened to your husband.

07:13.003 --> 07:15.004
(Ethan) Well, according
to Jessica's labs,

07:15.005 --> 07:16.636
she didn't have cancer.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.769
She wasn't a smoker, or
pregnant, or dehydrated.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.911
And she definitely wasn't obese.

07:21.912 --> 07:23.943
Which reminds me, have you
had your heart checked lately?

07:23.944 --> 07:27.016
You had your face
checked lately?

07:27.017 --> 07:28.918
(Clicking mouse button)

07:28.919 --> 07:30.920
Wait. Look at this.

07:30.921 --> 07:33.452
Jessica had elevated
levels of progesterone.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.454
She was on the pill.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.087
Okay, she has one marginal
risk factor for hypercoagulation,

07:38.088 --> 07:40.790
but there are millions
of women on the pill,

07:40.791 --> 07:43.893
and they don't all
die in their hotel beds.

07:43.894 --> 07:45.194
Wait. That's it.

07:45.195 --> 07:46.896
What's it?

07:46.897 --> 07:48.969
She died in her
hotel room, right?

07:51.071 --> 07:55.074
You thinking she just
got off an airplane?

07:55.075 --> 07:58.107
(People speaking indistinctly)

07:58.108 --> 08:00.680
(Peter) How long
since you've been here?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.982
Not since Gwen took over. Gwen?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.684
Gwen Baldwin.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.817
Nurse turned equipment rep
turned hospital administrator.

08:07.818 --> 08:09.959
A real health
care success story.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.961
I'm getting the warm fuzzies.

08:11.962 --> 08:13.963
Mm. We were friends once.

08:13.964 --> 08:16.666
You'd be amazed how many
Christmas cards stop coming

08:16.667 --> 08:19.999
after you've killed a patient
on the operating table.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.073
Just a second, Megan.

08:26.977 --> 08:30.580
I've never been accused
of having a green thumb,

08:30.581 --> 08:33.983
but these have
become my obsession.

08:33.984 --> 08:35.885
We're here about Ted harbison.

08:35.886 --> 08:37.887
Mark Chandler operated
on him this morning.

08:37.888 --> 08:40.990
A cholecystectomy, to be exact.
He exsanguinated internally.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.993
Might be an issue with his care.

08:43.994 --> 08:47.927
Well, then there are procedures
that have to be followed.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.000
Can you give us a second?

08:51.001 --> 08:53.863
Gwen.

08:53.864 --> 08:57.106
I know all about
your procedures.

08:57.107 --> 09:00.209
I just want to talk to
him, surgeon to surgeon.

09:00.210 --> 09:03.012
I used to be one,

09:03.013 --> 09:04.914
if you remember.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.976
Of course. I'm sorry.

09:06.977 --> 09:09.779
That must've been
horrible for you.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.081
The car accident and
then losing a patient.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.784
If I didn't reach out to you,

09:14.785 --> 09:17.787
it was because I was
dealing with a loss of my own.

09:17.788 --> 09:19.890
My son Nick.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.094
He o.D.'Ed his freshman
year at a frat party.

09:25.095 --> 09:27.066
The bonsai was his.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.769
For four years, I
have kept it alive,

09:29.770 --> 09:31.701
through plant lice

09:31.702 --> 09:33.973
and root rot. (Chuckles)

09:33.974 --> 09:36.746
Oh, god. I... Gwen, i'm...

09:36.747 --> 09:38.608
No, that is awful.

09:38.609 --> 09:40.610
(Voice breaks) Oh. Oh, god.

09:40.611 --> 09:42.753
(Sniffles)

09:44.615 --> 09:46.686
(Exhales deeply)

09:46.687 --> 09:49.088
(Sighs)

09:49.089 --> 09:51.891
Let's go find Dr. Chandler.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.894
I'm late for rounds.
What's this all about?

09:54.895 --> 09:57.196
Dr. Hunt is with the
medical examiner's office.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.198
You might want to pay attention.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.901
Ted harbison. You
operated on him this morning,

10:01.902 --> 10:03.202
a cholecystectomy.

10:03.203 --> 10:06.005
8:00. Discharged
at noon, I believe.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.809
And dead an hour later.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.811
(Sighs) That's my last
surgery of the morning.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.044
Then I went to my country
club after. Is he really dead?

10:15.045 --> 10:17.987
Exsanguinated internally.
Well, that's not possible.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.819
Oh, it's possible. It happened.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.121
Ted had two cystic
ducts, not one.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.794
You should've checked
for anomalous vasculature,

10:24.795 --> 10:27.797
but you didn't. You clipped one artery,
missed the other. Hey, hold on a second here.

10:27.798 --> 10:30.259
And how a man with
crashing blood pressure

10:30.260 --> 10:32.862
managed to sneak out
of your recovery room...

10:32.863 --> 10:36.135
That's another question I have.
He was a dead man walking. Wait.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.708
You're wrong, Dr. Hunt.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.070
Of course I checked for
anomalous vasculature,

10:41.071 --> 10:43.072
and of course I
clipped both arteries.

10:43.073 --> 10:45.244
The procedure went
perfectly. You don't believe me,

10:45.245 --> 10:48.918
check the video. Like I
said, I'm late for rounds.

10:48.919 --> 10:51.650
I'm gonna need that video.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.025
From now on, you can
talk to our general counsel.

10:57.027 --> 11:00.089
Kate is not gonna be happy
with you walking around

11:00.090 --> 11:03.092
making accusations without all your
ducks in a row. Kate is not a surgeon.

11:03.093 --> 11:06.736
You do not close a patient without
checking your work. Somehow I don't think

11:06.737 --> 11:09.739
your friend Gwen is gonna hand
over that video anytime soon.

11:09.740 --> 11:12.742
And how are you gonna prove
Chandler wrong without it, huh?

11:12.743 --> 11:15.745
Excuse me. I'm Nancy
follett. I'm a surgical nurse.

11:15.746 --> 11:17.246
I couldn't help overhearing.

11:17.247 --> 11:20.349
Yes?

11:20.350 --> 11:23.052
(Lowered voice) Chandler is
a disaster waiting to happen.

11:23.053 --> 11:25.354
The hospital loves him because
he whips through surgeries

11:25.355 --> 11:28.057
faster than a pit
crew, but he's reckless.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.859
He's left sponges
in the patients

11:29.860 --> 11:32.762
and then blamed the nurses
for getting the count wrong.

11:32.763 --> 11:35.194
Has he ever lost
a patient before?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.197
Not that I know of, but
it's just a matter of time.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.699
(Elevator bell dings)

11:41.171 --> 11:43.172
Somebody wanted to see me?

11:43.173 --> 11:45.836
Dr. Gross, this is Karen Archer.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.381
Oh, my god. You're...

11:52.382 --> 11:55.115
Jessica's twin sister.

11:57.187 --> 12:00.890
So if this guy is leaving
sponges in patients,

12:00.891 --> 12:03.923
how is he still practicing?
Happens all the time, unfortunately.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.925
The nurses keep the count,

12:05.926 --> 12:08.928
but if the surgeons disagree
and the nurses dare correct 'em,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.000
they get their heads
handed to them.

12:11.001 --> 12:13.302
Well, remind me to
never need an operation.

12:13.303 --> 12:16.265
Well, that looks like an
unclipped artery to me.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.267
Look again.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.770
What are they?

12:20.771 --> 12:23.442
Traumatic impressions
on the adventitia...

12:23.443 --> 12:25.744
The outer lining of the artery.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.077
Chandler did clip both arteries.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.780
Okay, so what
happened to the clips?

12:30.781 --> 12:34.354
There's only one
place they could be.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.073
Well, I'll be damned.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.017
We removed Ted
harbison's blood at autopsy,

13:08.018 --> 13:10.890
and this is what we found
when we put it through a sieve.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.892
(Megan) It turns
out that Dr. Chandler

13:12.893 --> 13:15.224
did clip the other artery,
but look at the clips.

13:15.225 --> 13:18.367
I can understand one not
being properly closed maybe,

13:18.368 --> 13:21.170
but three?

13:21.171 --> 13:24.133
Either Chandler was in such
a hurry to get to his golf game,

13:24.134 --> 13:26.135
he didn't notice,
making this malpractice,

13:26.136 --> 13:28.838
or that's how he
wanted it to look.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.240
Murder made to
look like malpractice?

13:31.241 --> 13:33.242
Never seen such a bad clip job.

13:33.243 --> 13:35.514
Yeah, but what's the motive?

13:35.515 --> 13:37.516
Well, Ted was an
accountant, right?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.518
So maybe there's
a hidden connection

13:39.519 --> 13:41.220
between him and Chandler.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.522
Well, guess I know
what I'm gonna be doing

13:43.523 --> 13:45.524
the rest of my afternoon.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.226
Murder by malpractice.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.159
That's bold, even for you.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.201
Thank you.

13:52.202 --> 13:54.203
So bold that I'm wondering

13:54.204 --> 13:57.106
if it has anything to do
with the patient you lost.

13:57.107 --> 13:59.538
Expiation for past sins maybe?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.610
What I did was an accident,

14:01.611 --> 14:04.213
and... (Sighs) Yeah,
i-I'm haunted by it.

14:04.214 --> 14:06.175
That guy isn't
haunted by anything.

14:06.176 --> 14:09.478
I'm gonna put him out of
business. No, what you're gonna do

14:09.479 --> 14:11.480
is give Chandler every
benefit of the doubt.

14:11.481 --> 14:14.583
Thenyou nail him, after
you are absolutely sure.

14:14.584 --> 14:17.486
Uh, we have a couple of
problems before we get to that.

14:17.487 --> 14:19.929
The video?

14:19.930 --> 14:23.032
Right. The hospital has
a video of Ted's surgery.

14:23.033 --> 14:26.265
I need you to lean on the
c.O.O. To give us a copy.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.597
(Chuckles) Her name
is Gwen Baldwin.

14:28.598 --> 14:30.269
Is that all? No.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.601
Mm. We also need the
staple gun that the doctor used

14:32.602 --> 14:34.103
during the procedure.

14:34.104 --> 14:36.275
Usually they're destroyed
within 24 hours of use.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.277
Without it, he will
claim equipment failure,

14:38.278 --> 14:42.011
and we will not have any evidence to prove
otherwise. Unless it was equipment failure.

14:42.012 --> 14:45.615
Are you gonna help me or not?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.167
She died from a clot

14:58.168 --> 15:00.199
that stopped blood
flowing to her heart.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.631
We checked her for risk factors

15:02.632 --> 15:04.633
and found that
she was on the pill.

15:04.634 --> 15:07.206
That, in combination
with her recent travels,

15:07.207 --> 15:09.509
leads us to think it was
deep vein thrombosis.

15:11.942 --> 15:14.183
(Karen) Our parents are dead.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.245
We're all each other had.

15:16.246 --> 15:18.547
(Voice breaks) We
were inseparable once...

15:18.548 --> 15:21.450
(Sniffles) But life happened.

15:21.451 --> 15:24.123
Different careers
in different cities.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.127
But I always missed
the way we used to be.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.232
(Sniffles)

15:33.233 --> 15:34.533
Thank you.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.308
Would you like to go
somewhere else to talk?

15:42.142 --> 15:43.473
(Sniffles)

15:48.018 --> 15:50.279
You mentioned something
about my sister's recent travels.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.682
What did you mean? Long flights,
sitting for long periods of time,

15:53.683 --> 15:55.484
can cause blood clots.

15:55.485 --> 15:58.657
That, in combination
with other risk factors.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.330
By the way, do you know
where you sister was flying from?

16:01.331 --> 16:04.263
She didn't fly from anywhere.
But she was staying in a hotel.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.096
No, Jess lives in Philly.
She was staying at that hotel

16:07.097 --> 16:09.638
because her apartment's
being painted. Oh.

16:09.639 --> 16:12.141
I have to go to her
apartment tomorrow.

16:12.142 --> 16:14.303
Any idea where
45th and locust is?

16:14.304 --> 16:16.305
I've never been
to Philly before.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.647
Yeah. It's, um, it's
near penn campus.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.409
Where is that? (Chuckles)

16:20.410 --> 16:23.252
(Laughs) It's, uh,
it's in west Philly.

16:23.253 --> 16:27.116
Would you come with me?
We grew up in Minneapolis.

16:27.117 --> 16:29.118
That's where my
parents are buried.

16:29.119 --> 16:31.490
That's where I'm
taking Jess and her stuff.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.193
I could use some help
finding my way around,

16:34.194 --> 16:37.196
and you're the only person
I know here. (Chuckles)

16:37.197 --> 16:38.497
(Chuckles)

16:38.498 --> 16:41.300
Well, I, um...

16:41.301 --> 16:43.632
I-I...

16:43.633 --> 16:46.205
I'm your sister's doctor,

16:46.206 --> 16:48.637
and... you're in, uh,

16:48.638 --> 16:50.409
an emotional state,

16:50.410 --> 16:53.312
and, um, i-it would be
inappropriate, you know?

16:53.313 --> 16:56.285
Right? Don't you think?
What do you think?

16:56.286 --> 16:59.689
I don't think it'd be
inappropriate at all.

17:08.198 --> 17:10.700
See you tomorrow?

17:21.271 --> 17:24.743
Dr. Chandler was a
referral from my ob-gyn.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.246
We'd never heard
of him before that.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.248
Well, maybe in a
different context.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.650
Did Ted ever do any
accounting for him?

17:31.651 --> 17:35.053
Uh, no. No, most of his
clients were nonprofits.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.655
Mm. You recycle?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.657
Um, end of the counter.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.159
Nonprofits need accountants?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.660
I know, right?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.662
We used to joke about it...

17:43.663 --> 17:46.335
Who had less money,
us or his clients.

17:46.336 --> 17:48.367
For a money guy,

17:48.368 --> 17:51.400
Ted was not very
good at making it.

17:51.401 --> 17:54.644
Ted have any life insurance?

18:00.610 --> 18:04.213
Unfortunately, there is
no video. We checked.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.215
The recording
equipment was turned off.

18:06.216 --> 18:08.317
Okay, I didn't come
here to be stonewalled.

18:08.318 --> 18:11.290
Mr. Hollis, you sure you
want to tangle with me?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.422
We can't give you a
video that doesn't exist.

18:13.423 --> 18:16.425
Hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong,
but your bottom line depends on

18:16.426 --> 18:20.169
tax breaks that are up for renewal
by the city council. (Telephone rings)

18:20.170 --> 18:22.171
(Woman) Mayor's
office. Hi, Maggie. It's...

18:22.172 --> 18:25.604
Hi, Dr. Murphy, how are you?
I'm fine, Maggie. Thanks. Is he in?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.437
Yeah. Hold on. I'll put
you right through. (Clicks)

18:28.438 --> 18:30.409
There really is no
video tape. I swear.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.411
You can bring
your I.T. People in

18:32.412 --> 18:34.743
and check yourself.

18:34.744 --> 18:37.786
But in the spirit
of cooperation...

18:37.787 --> 18:40.349
These are the employee files

18:40.350 --> 18:42.651
for everyone on
Dr. Chandler's surgical team

18:42.652 --> 18:44.653
with access to that equipment.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.355
Well, that's a start.

18:46.356 --> 18:49.358
I also want access to
your biohazard waste.

18:49.359 --> 18:52.362

19:21.331 --> 19:23.562
This is her case.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.265
Well, Megan offered to
help us solve our case

19:26.266 --> 19:28.367
if we helped her solve hers.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.669
What do you mean
"solve our case"?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.701
Jessica Archer died
from a blood clot.

19:32.702 --> 19:35.704
Yeah, well, technically,
yes, but I would like to be able

19:35.705 --> 19:38.577
to tell her sister more
than just what killed her.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.509
Why?

19:40.510 --> 19:42.511
(Sighs) 'Cause I'm
seeing her tomorrow,

19:42.512 --> 19:44.553
and I don't know
what to talk about.

19:44.554 --> 19:47.916
You using a dead
girl to hit on her sister?

19:47.917 --> 19:50.419
No. No way. I-I told
her it was inappropriate,

19:50.420 --> 19:52.421
but she kind of insisted.

19:52.422 --> 19:55.794
Mm-hmm. So you telling me
I'm up to my knees in biowaste

19:55.795 --> 19:59.528
just so you have
something to talk about?

19:59.529 --> 20:01.230
Yes.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.573
Oh, no. I'm so
outta here. Unh-unh.

20:23.293 --> 20:25.394
Are you afraid of flying?

20:25.395 --> 20:26.895
No.

20:26.896 --> 20:29.398
That was a hell of
thing that Ted did,

20:29.399 --> 20:31.400
getting into that pilot's seat

20:31.401 --> 20:33.732
just to overcome his fear.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.705
I get the feeling that
this case has brought up

20:36.706 --> 20:38.707
a fear of your own.

20:38.708 --> 20:41.940
One that I will never
have to face again.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.443
But you're worried
that Chandler will.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.546
You know what happens to a
surgeon when he screws up?

20:47.547 --> 20:49.948
Physician-related
deaths get reported

20:49.949 --> 20:51.450
to an independent commission,

20:51.451 --> 20:54.383
and that commission can
take as long as they want to act.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.855
Meanwhile, the doctor
is still performing surgery.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.527
You know why? Lawyers?

20:58.528 --> 21:00.689
Malpractice lawyers. Ah.

21:00.690 --> 21:03.662
I could've hidden behind
them if I wanted to, but I didn't.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.664
I mean, how could
I live with myself?

21:05.665 --> 21:08.667
So I settled out of court,
and when I found out

21:08.668 --> 21:11.370
that my paresthesias
were not going away,

21:11.371 --> 21:13.842
I just closed my practice,
and that was that.

21:13.843 --> 21:15.844
Well, if it matters, it was a...

21:15.845 --> 21:18.947
It was a hell of a thing
that you did, Megan.

21:18.948 --> 21:21.950
I don't see Dr. Chandler doing
that anytime soon, do you?

21:21.951 --> 21:24.313
Who's the man? Who's theman?!

21:24.314 --> 21:27.316
Uh, you forgetting somebody?

21:27.317 --> 21:29.618
Who are the men?
Who are themen?!

21:29.619 --> 21:32.891
(Chuckles) All right. Bring
'em over. Let's have a look.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.964
Unh-unh. First Jessica Archer.

21:35.965 --> 21:39.498
All right.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.029
You're on.

21:41.030 --> 21:44.403
Did she have fatigue,
shortness of breath,

21:44.404 --> 21:47.305
palpitations before she died?

21:47.306 --> 21:48.777
How would we know?

21:48.778 --> 21:50.709
Fair point. Blood in the urine?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.341
No. All right.

21:52.342 --> 21:55.013
That eliminates paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.946
What about kidney
damage? Unh-unh.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.818
No nephrotic syndrome.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.950
Did you check for
lupus anticoagulant,

22:01.951 --> 22:03.622
acquired conditions?

22:03.623 --> 22:06.054
Of course.
Hereditary conditions?

22:06.055 --> 22:08.557
Protein c, protein
s, factor v leiden?

22:08.558 --> 22:11.360
All very common. (Sighs) Mm.

22:11.361 --> 22:14.433
(Laughs) Hand it over.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.105
You're good.
(Singsongy) Thank you.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.967
(Clicks)

22:18.968 --> 22:21.740
(Click)

22:21.741 --> 22:23.742
Good.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.874
(Click) Good.

22:25.875 --> 22:29.978
(Click)

22:29.979 --> 22:32.582
So it was equipment failure.

22:36.486 --> 22:39.357
The seal is broken.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.460
(Clatters)

22:41.461 --> 22:44.494
Someone has
tampered with this gun.

22:53.042 --> 22:56.405
You got the wrong
guy. I didn't do anything.

22:56.406 --> 22:59.408
Let me tell you something,
petty theft is one thing,

22:59.409 --> 23:01.610
but conspiracy to
commit murder is another.

23:01.611 --> 23:04.453
Now did mindy harbison
hire you to jump her husband

23:04.454 --> 23:06.114
after his surgery? No!

23:06.115 --> 23:09.788
Look familiar? I've never
even seen her before.

23:09.789 --> 23:13.391
(Chuckles) Why don't I believe
you? Because you prejudiced.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.694
Hey, detective. Can I see that?

23:15.695 --> 23:19.528
Oh, yeah. I saw her
here a couple of days ago.

23:19.529 --> 23:22.070
She got three cheesesteaks...
Two for here and one to go.

23:22.071 --> 23:24.903
And who was the other "for here"
cheesesteak for? A nurse. Yeah.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.806
She was wearing the, you
know, the blue hospital scrubs.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.539
The hospital's right down the
street. What did this nurse look like?

23:30.540 --> 23:33.041
You were looking for me?

23:33.042 --> 23:34.543
Yeah.

23:34.544 --> 23:37.546
Swimming in a bunch of
biowaste yesterday got me thinking.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.548
That stuff is kept
sterile for a reason.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.550
If somebody tampered
with our staple gun,

23:41.551 --> 23:44.553
maybe they contaminated it,
too, so I swabbed the chamber

23:44.554 --> 23:47.556
and found a bunch of resting
spores. What kind of spores?

23:47.557 --> 23:49.558
Don't know yet. I
ordered a p.C.R.

23:49.559 --> 23:52.561
Should have the results in a
few hours. Good work, doctor.

23:52.562 --> 23:54.102
Damn straight.

23:54.103 --> 23:56.805
I think this is the last box.

23:56.806 --> 23:58.106
(Grunts)

23:58.107 --> 24:00.839
Still worried about
taking advantage of me?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.841
I'm getting over it.
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)

24:02.842 --> 24:05.143
Hey, thanks.
(Grunts) No problem.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.645
(Sighs)

24:06.646 --> 24:08.747
Are you cold?

24:08.748 --> 24:11.149
Yeah.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.121
I made this for Jess.

24:13.122 --> 24:16.124
She said she couldn't get
any good knits out here.

24:16.125 --> 24:19.127
Mm.

24:19.128 --> 24:22.832
(Thunder rumbling)

24:24.093 --> 24:27.096
(Crying) And it
still smells like her.

24:32.542 --> 24:36.105
(Crying)

24:38.648 --> 24:41.780
(Sighs) It's okay.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.481
It's okay.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.815
I'm sorry.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.987
You're right. (Sniffles)

24:48.988 --> 24:51.489
I'm in an emotional state.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.491
(Laughs and sniffles)

24:53.492 --> 24:56.064
So...

24:56.065 --> 24:58.567
When are you...
When are you leaving?

24:58.568 --> 25:00.629
(Laughs and sniffles)

25:00.630 --> 25:03.131
Not soon enough for
you, I'm sure. (Laughs)

25:03.132 --> 25:06.004
(Laughs) No, no, no, no.
I... are you kidding me?

25:06.005 --> 25:08.006
You know... You
know, I love moving.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.008
Pianos are my specialty.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.180
(Laughs and sniffles)

25:12.181 --> 25:15.243
Thanks. I needed that.

25:15.244 --> 25:18.286
I'm not kidding. (Laughs)

25:18.287 --> 25:20.819
There is no video
of Ted's surgery.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.852
The equipment was turned off.

25:23.853 --> 25:27.225
It would have to be one of the
nurses. (Sam) I can help you there.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.197
Ted's wife mindy had lunch

25:29.198 --> 25:31.199
near the hospital the
day before his surgery.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.032
She was with a nurse in
northeast general scrubs.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.635
Uh, she was thin, about
5'6", African-American,

25:36.636 --> 25:38.206
wearing black-rimmed eyeglasses.

25:38.207 --> 25:41.840
Nancy follett. We talked to
her at the hospital yesterday,

25:41.841 --> 25:45.543
and she called Chandler "a disaster
waiting to happen." (Kate) Wait a minute.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.545
Nancy follett? That was
one of the employee files

25:47.546 --> 25:49.247
they showed me at the hospital.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.249
Chandler wrote her
up multiple times.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.823
So Nancy makes a disaster
happen to get back at Chandler,

25:54.824 --> 25:57.155
but why talk to mindy?

25:57.156 --> 25:59.828
Money. I checked them out.

25:59.829 --> 26:02.891
Ted had none, and they were
mortgaged up to their eyeballs,

26:02.892 --> 26:05.163
and Ted's life insurance
policy was terminated

26:05.164 --> 26:07.165
when he got his pilot's license.

26:07.166 --> 26:10.799
So a malpractice lawsuit solves both
their problems. It was genius, actually.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.742
(Sighs) So Nancy tampers
with gun, turns off the camera...

26:13.743 --> 26:15.744
And Ted leaves
the hospital unaware

26:15.745 --> 26:18.246
that his clips are popping
off with every step.

26:18.247 --> 26:20.749
Then he lost consciousness
and fell into the bushes.

26:20.750 --> 26:24.312
Well, I guess it's time I
spoke with Nancy follett.

26:24.313 --> 26:27.315
And I think you should
take another stab at mindy.

26:27.316 --> 26:28.987
(Elevator bell dings)

26:28.988 --> 26:30.258
Hey. What's up?

26:30.259 --> 26:32.891
Where the hell have you been?

26:32.892 --> 26:34.863
I was out.

26:34.864 --> 26:36.194
Mm-hmm.

26:36.195 --> 26:39.197
Well, why you were
out, I got your answer.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.699
Jessica was positive

26:40.700 --> 26:43.171
for the factor v
leiden gene mutation.

26:43.172 --> 26:46.334
Thank you.

26:46.335 --> 26:48.206
Hey, refresh my memory.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.639
It's like a coagulation
cutoff switch

26:50.640 --> 26:53.181
that doesn't cut
off when it should.

26:53.182 --> 26:55.784
And you better run
a d.N.A. For zygosity.

26:55.785 --> 26:57.816
There's a difference
in morbidity. How big?

26:57.817 --> 27:00.318
Big. You get the mild version,
you have five to seven times

27:00.319 --> 27:02.320
greater risk of developing
a clot like Jessica's.

27:02.321 --> 27:05.293
You get the severe version,
up to an 80 times greater risk.

27:05.294 --> 27:07.295
Wait. So... so if Jessica
had the severe version,

27:07.296 --> 27:09.627
and Karen's her
identical twin, then sh...

27:09.628 --> 27:11.329
Then she's got it, too.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.701
(Ding)

27:12.702 --> 27:14.132
(Doors open)

27:14.133 --> 27:16.064
(Mindy) No, look, look.

27:16.065 --> 27:17.736
You've got it all wrong.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.368
Nancy was just trying to
warn us about Dr. Chandler.

27:20.369 --> 27:22.240
Why you, huh?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.042
We have the same ob-gyn.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.644
She heard him referring
us to Dr. Chandler.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.217
She said she felt obligated
to try to dissuade us,

27:29.218 --> 27:32.350
so we went to the cheesesteak place to talk.
And you kept this to yourself the whole time?

27:32.351 --> 27:34.853
She said she'd be fired
if Chandler found out.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.886
If she was trying to warn you,
why did Ted go through with it?

27:37.887 --> 27:39.357
His pain had become acute.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.230
He wasn't even scheduled
to be operated on yesterday.

27:42.231 --> 27:45.994
Dr. Chandler squeezed
him in at the last minute.

27:45.995 --> 27:49.738
How did you overlook turning
on the video equipment?

27:49.739 --> 27:52.670
Video equipment gets
overlooked all the time.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.672
But you're the one who
hands the staple gun over

27:54.673 --> 27:56.144
to the doctor, aren't you?

27:56.145 --> 27:57.445
Sorry to interrupt.

27:57.446 --> 27:59.677
Sam, we just talked
to mindy harbison.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.750
Did Dr. Chandler have
any surgeries scheduled

28:01.751 --> 28:05.083
yesterday after rounds? Only one at
10:00 P.M., another cholecystectomy.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.415
And did he use the same
surgical setup as he did on Ted,

28:07.416 --> 28:09.417
a new pack of staple guns?

28:09.418 --> 28:12.290
Yes and no. We didn't use a
new pack for Ted's operation.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.092
What? What do you
mean? The circulating nurse

28:14.093 --> 28:16.795
brought two guns from
a previous operation.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.997
We only used one
from the new pack.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.199
What's going on, Megan? Ted
was a last-minute reschedule.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.271
He wasn't the
intended target. What?

28:23.272 --> 28:25.303
Staple guns come
in packs of three.

28:25.304 --> 28:28.336
This whole time, I thought
we were talking about

28:28.337 --> 28:30.138
one gun being tampered with.

28:30.139 --> 28:32.310
There are now two guns
that are unaccounted for.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.442
We have to get to the hospital
before somebody else dies.

28:34.443 --> 28:37.415
My name is Dr. Kate Murphy.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.248
I'm with the medical
examiner's office.

28:40.249 --> 28:42.821
I want you all to stop
what you're doing.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.924
I'm shutting you down.

28:52.201 --> 28:55.433
(Indistinct conversations)

28:55.434 --> 28:58.837
You can't do this. You
don't have the authority.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.009
I do. Imminent
circumstances, Ms. Baldwin.

29:01.010 --> 29:03.141
You have a life-threatening
situation on your hands.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.974
What are you talking about? (Chandler)
What in the hell's going on? Hey.

29:05.975 --> 29:08.376
I got an appendix in there
prepped and ready to go.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.378
Chandler, you used three
staple guns on harbison.

29:10.379 --> 29:12.220
Two were from a previous pack.

29:12.221 --> 29:15.053
So? So the tampered
gun you used on him

29:15.054 --> 29:16.925
was the first of a
new pack of three.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.887
If the entire pack was
tampered with, there are

29:18.888 --> 29:21.259
two guns unaccounted for that
were used on someone else.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.332
Who did you operate on last night? Male, 20s,
suffering from idiopathic cholelithiasis.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.234
Does he have a name? Um...

29:26.235 --> 29:29.868
Why am I not surprised? You stand
in my shoes, then you can judge me.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.240
I've already done both.
(Peter) Megan, I got it.

29:32.241 --> 29:34.302
George white, cholecystectomy
last night at 10:00 P.M.

29:34.303 --> 29:37.183
We have an address. All right, go. I'll
have the ambulance meet you there.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.249
Yes, this is Dr. Brumfield.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.252
I sent you a p.C.R. Request
that came back positive

29:44.253 --> 29:46.915
for a fungus called
apiosporina collinsii.

29:46.916 --> 29:49.088
Are you sure that's right?

29:50.389 --> 29:52.390
Hi, Karen. It's Ethan again.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.093
Um, if you could call
me back at the office,

29:55.094 --> 29:58.096
I would greatly appreciate
it. It's really important, okay?

29:58.097 --> 30:00.098
So call me back
when you get this.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.100
Okay. Bye-bye. Okay,
call me back. (Sighs)

30:02.101 --> 30:03.471
Okay.

30:03.472 --> 30:05.304
(Exhales)

30:06.575 --> 30:08.336
(Exhales) What?

30:08.337 --> 30:10.338
You leave the girl
any more messages,

30:10.339 --> 30:13.241
she'll think you're stalking
her. Well, what would you do?

30:13.242 --> 30:15.483
I wouldn't be sitting
here talking to me.

30:15.484 --> 30:19.447
(Indistinct conversations)

30:19.448 --> 30:21.519
Hey. Thank you.

30:21.520 --> 30:25.053
The boy is crazy.

30:25.054 --> 30:28.097
(Tires squeal)

30:31.500 --> 30:34.333
Where's the damn ambulance?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.870
(Rattles door)

30:41.871 --> 30:43.841
Stand back.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.315
(Glass clatters)

30:54.283 --> 30:55.854
He's alive, but barely.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.527
What are you doing?

30:59.528 --> 31:02.860
There's no time.
(Utensils clattering)

31:02.861 --> 31:06.395
I open him up now... Or he dies.

31:33.422 --> 31:35.363
What's wrong?

31:35.364 --> 31:38.266
Last time I did this,
I killed somebody.

31:38.267 --> 31:40.668
Megan, it's okay.
You can do this.

31:40.669 --> 31:42.501
I hope you're right.

31:50.179 --> 31:52.610
Grab those towels.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.383
Keep as much blood
inside him as possible.

31:55.384 --> 31:57.285
I thought too much
blood was the problem.

31:57.286 --> 31:59.988
At this point, it's
restricting the blood flow.

31:59.989 --> 32:03.492
It's probably the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.328
You okay? Yeah. Why?

32:10.329 --> 32:13.001
My first time in the O.R., I
fainted. Well, I'll faint later on, okay?

32:13.002 --> 32:16.064
Grab the towels.
Did you find the leak?

32:16.065 --> 32:18.366
There's no way to know
for sure what's leaking.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.668
The thing that I'm
looking for is the...

32:20.669 --> 32:23.241
Ah. There it is.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.942
Descending aorta.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.445
Now the trick is
to squeeze it shut,

32:27.446 --> 32:29.177
but not completely shut.

32:29.178 --> 32:32.080
Why is that the trick?
He's young, he's healthy.

32:32.081 --> 32:34.582
Right now, I am depriving blood

32:34.583 --> 32:36.584
not only to his leaking vessels

32:36.585 --> 32:39.457
but his entire lower
half of his body.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.659
If I squeeze too tight,

32:41.660 --> 32:44.732
or if the ambulance
doesn't get here,

32:44.733 --> 32:47.366
he'll never walk again.

32:59.348 --> 33:01.249
(Nancy) This is Dr. Megan hunt

33:01.250 --> 33:03.411
and her colleague, Peter dunlop.

33:03.412 --> 33:05.613
They're the ones
who saved your life.

33:05.614 --> 33:07.615
Actually, it was, uh, all her.

33:07.616 --> 33:10.188
Oh.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.320
I don't know how to thank you.

33:12.321 --> 33:14.462
How are you feeling? Confused.

33:14.463 --> 33:17.165
One minute I was headed for
the fridge... (Cell phone rings)

33:17.166 --> 33:18.496
Next, I woke up here.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.498
Hello. Hey, Curtis.
How you doing?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.431
Well, you had a close call.

33:23.432 --> 33:25.433
And i'm... I'm very
sorry about the scar.

33:25.434 --> 33:28.476
Your kitchen knives are
not too sharp. (Laughs)

33:28.477 --> 33:30.378
You kidding?

33:30.379 --> 33:33.281
I'm already the envy of all my
frat buddies. (Cell phone beeps)

33:33.282 --> 33:36.013
They won't leave me alone.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.515
(Sighs)

33:41.490 --> 33:44.192

indistinctly over P.A.)

33:44.193 --> 33:46.094
When did you graduate?

33:46.095 --> 33:48.127
Four years ago.

33:52.201 --> 33:54.632
Have you ever heard
of a boy named...

33:54.633 --> 33:57.066
Nick Baldwin?

33:58.737 --> 34:00.808
(People speaking indistinctly)

34:00.809 --> 34:03.271
(Mouse button clicking)

34:03.272 --> 34:04.613
Congratulations.

34:06.345 --> 34:09.217
A colleague of mine...

34:09.218 --> 34:14.322
Just told me something
that I never knew before.

34:14.323 --> 34:16.784
There is no such thing

34:16.785 --> 34:19.127
as a bonsai tree seed.

34:19.128 --> 34:24.132
Instead, you take the
seed of a healthy tree

34:24.133 --> 34:27.435
and infect it with
a fungus that...

34:27.436 --> 34:30.067
Genetically alters
its root system.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.301
It's called
apiosporina collinsii.

34:33.302 --> 34:36.404
We found it on the
staple gun, Gwen.

34:36.405 --> 34:38.376
You gave us all the files

34:38.377 --> 34:40.808
of everyone who had
access to the supply room.

34:40.809 --> 34:43.751
You failed to include yours.

34:43.752 --> 34:47.084
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.687
I'm talking about
the death of your son.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.819
George white... the social chair

34:51.820 --> 34:55.823
of the Dexter fraternity.

34:55.824 --> 34:59.467
The fraternity where Nick
o.D.'Ed four years ago.

34:59.468 --> 35:01.329
George just told
me all about it...

35:01.330 --> 35:03.771
The rush party,
the peer pressure,

35:03.772 --> 35:05.533
cocaine.

35:05.534 --> 35:08.176
Nick tried it. He collapsed.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.438
And nobody realized
that he'd suffered

35:10.439 --> 35:12.410
cocaine-induced
cardiac arrhythmia

35:12.411 --> 35:14.342
until the next morning.

35:14.343 --> 35:15.843
(Crying) Please stop, Megan.

35:15.844 --> 35:17.845
When you found
out that George white

35:17.846 --> 35:20.348
was scheduled for surgery
in your own hospital,

35:20.349 --> 35:24.592
you saw the chance to get
back at him for killing your son.

35:24.593 --> 35:27.195
You knew
Dr. Chandler's reputation.

35:27.196 --> 35:31.299
You knew the ins and
outs of surgical staple guns.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.302
You were an equipment
rep when I was a surgeon.

35:34.303 --> 35:36.334
You knew exactly what to do.

35:36.335 --> 35:38.336
But in doing it, you
contaminated the guns

35:38.337 --> 35:41.509
with the fungus
from the bonsai tree.

35:41.510 --> 35:43.511
Then you switched
out the tampered gun

35:43.512 --> 35:46.514
with the guns that were to
be used in George's operation.

35:46.515 --> 35:50.147
The one thing
you didn't count on

35:50.148 --> 35:53.421
was the schedule change.

35:53.422 --> 35:57.585
Putting Ted harbison
in George white's place.

35:57.586 --> 35:59.587
(Voice breaking)
Do you know what...

35:59.588 --> 36:02.890
George white and his
fraternity brothers got

36:02.891 --> 36:04.663
for killing my son?

36:06.235 --> 36:07.695
Nothing.

36:07.696 --> 36:09.367
No criminal charges.

36:09.368 --> 36:13.441
The university put them
on administrative probation.

36:13.442 --> 36:15.403
Probation.

36:15.404 --> 36:18.306
(Sobs) What would
you have done, Megan,

36:18.307 --> 36:19.747
if it was your daughter

36:19.748 --> 36:22.450
and the son of a
bitch who killed her

36:22.451 --> 36:24.282
was under your scalpel?

36:24.283 --> 36:26.654
I wouldn't kill him.

36:26.655 --> 36:29.458
Then you're not the
Megan hunt I remember.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.967
We were friends once, Gwen.

36:41.370 --> 36:44.372
It's the only reason I'm
not gonna turn you in.

36:44.373 --> 36:46.774
Oh. Thank you.

36:46.775 --> 36:50.207
(Sobs) Oh, god.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.540
Thank you, Megan.

36:52.541 --> 36:55.283
I'm gonna let
you do it yourself.

36:55.284 --> 36:57.286
(Gasps)

36:58.717 --> 37:01.790
(Rainfall)

37:06.555 --> 37:10.228
(Horn honking)

37:13.802 --> 37:17.004
Ethan. You know, I've
been calling you all day.

37:17.005 --> 37:19.006
I left my cell phone
here this morning.

37:19.007 --> 37:21.839
I'm just going to the airport.
No. No, you're not. No, you're not.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.541
Your... your sister was positive

37:23.542 --> 37:25.943
for the factor v leiden
mutation. I do... i...

37:25.944 --> 37:27.575
Depending on
your d.N.A. Results,

37:27.576 --> 37:30.578
you getting on a plane is like,
uh, playing Russian roulette.

37:30.579 --> 37:32.280
What are you talking about?

37:32.281 --> 37:33.951
I've been flying my whole life.

37:33.952 --> 37:37.285
Are you really gonna
argue with me about this?

37:37.286 --> 37:40.458
Well... this is a long way
to go to keep me around.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.961
I'll settle for
keeping you alive.

37:47.496 --> 37:48.996
(Tires squeal)

37:48.997 --> 37:50.538
(Parking brake clicks)

37:50.539 --> 37:52.540
(Turns off engine)
What'd I do now?

37:52.541 --> 37:55.603
Not that you care, but
George white is fine.

37:55.604 --> 37:59.447
Your 10:00 from last night.

37:59.448 --> 38:02.810
Let me guess. (Grunts)
You want to split the fee.

38:02.811 --> 38:04.352
(Chuckles)

38:04.353 --> 38:07.585
Yeah, I used to
be as smug as you.

38:07.586 --> 38:11.589
Technically, Ted harbison's
death is not your fault.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.461
Gwen relied upon

38:13.462 --> 38:14.922
your reputation
for recklessness.

38:14.923 --> 38:17.595
You didn't check
yourwork, doctor.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.597
One day, you
will kill a patient.

38:19.598 --> 38:22.430
You don't want that
on your conscience.

38:22.431 --> 38:24.772
Like it is on yours?

38:24.773 --> 38:26.774
Yeah, I looked you up. Ah.

38:26.775 --> 38:29.076
I know your story, doctor.

38:29.077 --> 38:31.078
I admire your
decision to retire.

38:31.079 --> 38:32.510
Oh.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.512
But don't presume to lecture me.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.514
I'm not the one
who killed a patient.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.086
And I'm not the
monster you think I am.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.088
I'm devastated by what happened.

38:41.089 --> 38:42.450
Really?

38:42.451 --> 38:45.723
You mourn on the golf course?

38:45.724 --> 38:48.726
I guess I'm just not
the Saint you are.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.428
(Laughs)

38:50.429 --> 38:54.402
I am no Saint, believe me.

38:54.403 --> 38:56.604
But if your name

38:56.605 --> 38:59.667
ever comes up in connection
with one of my patients again,

38:59.668 --> 39:01.839
your work better be flawless

39:01.840 --> 39:04.542
or you're gonna
be selling this baby

39:04.543 --> 39:06.514
to cover your legal fees.

39:06.515 --> 39:09.477
(Laughs)

39:09.478 --> 39:10.619
Yeah.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.452
You and your sister
are homozygote carriers

39:14.453 --> 39:17.655
of the factor v leiden mutation.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.356
What does that mean?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.358
It means we're gonna send you

39:21.359 --> 39:23.360
to the best
hematologist in the city.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.033
But from now on, you're
gonna be monitored by a doctor.

39:26.034 --> 39:28.596
From now on? Look,
this is serious, Karen.

39:28.597 --> 39:30.468
I mean, with medication

39:30.469 --> 39:32.400
and minor lifestyle adjustments,

39:32.401 --> 39:34.141
you... probably nothing
will ever happen.

39:34.142 --> 39:36.474
But you have to be vigilant.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.577
And you are not
getting on another plane

39:39.578 --> 39:42.109
without being checked
out by an expert first.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.452
Why are you smiling?

39:44.453 --> 39:46.584
I like it when you're bossy.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.687
It's cute.

39:50.519 --> 39:54.161
It is?

39:54.162 --> 39:55.663
(Laughs)

39:55.664 --> 39:57.565
Well, doctors,

39:57.566 --> 39:59.727
it seems my fate
is in your hands,

39:59.728 --> 40:03.472
so... where do you
want to send me?

40:20.118 --> 40:22.149
(Mouths words)

40:22.150 --> 40:23.821
I don't know what's appropriate

40:23.822 --> 40:25.493

40:25.494 --> 40:28.797
so when you find
out, give me a call.

How long, ethically speaking,

40:38.206 --> 40:42.039
