WEBVTT

00:07.549 --> 00:11.261
And five, six, seven, eight.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.973
Clap, punch, kick. Clap, punch, kick.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.725
Clap, punch, kick.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.853
And sweep up.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.730
Up.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.442
Up and out of bed, you lazy bitch.

01:54.031 --> 01:58.493
And just like that,
it's over and you're you again.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.834
Just another sweaty bitch sitting
on your fat ass waiting for the next one.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.795
How long until you get back here?
What's it gonna take?

02:12.424 --> 02:15.844
Get more. More time, more money.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.638
-Just get the damn toilet paper.
-Time. Money.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.015
Time. Money.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.809
You ever think about
getting another teacher?

02:22.893 --> 02:23.936
You lead every class.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.896
You can't grow your business.
You should get another teacher.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.858
You mean like you?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.738
Of all the conceited yuppie, asshole crap.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.281
You've been in classes for,
like, two weeks.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.367
But I've been in dance my whole life.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.952
I don't give a squirt of shit.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.996
You stole from us and now you're, like,
begging to teach at my studio.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.415
Pretty sure you're just a total psycho.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.918
I'm a woman, and I was in trouble.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.002
I needed money.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.463
I didn't have a way to get my own.
I still don't.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.216
I'm supposed to feel sorry for you
'cause you didn't rob us good enough.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.677
Now I'm supposed to let you
rob my students too?

02:56.760 --> 02:59.680
I would bring in my own students,
help your business grow.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.433
Just like you got Tyler a job.
But he hasn't heard shit.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.937
You're just like his porn directors.
Overpromising and under-delivering.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.023
I don't know, Bunny.
Isn't delivering kind of all they do?

03:10.107 --> 03:13.151
I'm not talking about fucking.
I'm talking about paying.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.446
I would deliver to both of you.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.448
What do you got to lose?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.201
She could be right.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.788
Isn't, like, passive income
the American dream?

03:25.622 --> 03:29.877
Like sitting back, a beer and a joint,
letting the little man bring it on home.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.596
One try, one class, one time.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.307
But ditch the ballet slippers.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.310
It's a workout, not a recital.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.521
And bring some toilet paper.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.734
I can't afford another trip to the gyno.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.570
Have that.

04:00.032 --> 04:04.161
All we need are a thousand voters'
signatures and then we are on the ballot.

04:05.871 --> 04:09.041
Okay, so the only bummer is that
we don't really have so much time, okay.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.460
So we've really got to hit it to the max.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.296
Your locations should be
on your clipboards.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.382
Sheila, if you wanna--

04:17.466 --> 04:18.926
-Sorry.
-The clipboards.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.302
Remember, voters,

04:20.385 --> 04:23.096
they need to write their names
exactly as they're registered, okay.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.057
And they can only sign for themselves.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.558
Yeah. So, you know, be on the lookout

04:26.642 --> 04:28.519
for any Mickey Mouses,
Clark Kents, Jim Browns.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.603
Definitely.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.481
Saboteurs can, like, completely
invalidate your entire petition

04:32.564 --> 04:34.441
with one wrong name or date.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.819
Plus don't forget blue ink only.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.697
-Say it with me.
-Blue ink only.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.615
Good Lord.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.908
And I-- If I may, just for a second,

04:42.991 --> 04:44.576
I know a lot of you heard me say in class

04:44.660 --> 04:47.538
that democracy only works
when we participate in it.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.831
I'll tell you what I see
in my living room right now.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.208
Coeds with visible nipples?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.876
Democracy at work.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.671
We may not have the money
the other guys have.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.006
But I'll tell you what, we have you.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.176
People who believe in the process
and their place in it.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.013
So, from the bottom of my heart,
thank you very much.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.974
All right, let's get out there.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.934
Let's fucking shred those talking points,
all right.

05:09.017 --> 05:14.690
Danny is the democratically endorsed
candidate leading Save Our Wave.

05:16.525 --> 05:17.651
All right.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.988
Oh, God.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.324
Great turnout, babe.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.618
Yeah, I gotta say
it feels pretty good, you know.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.371
I knew I was liked.
I didn't know I was this liked.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.873
You thought you were this liked.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.958
Hey, how do you feel about
hitting up the co-op?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.918
-You know, Simone and I--
-"Simone and I"?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.045
We're thinking that could be good
because they already know you there.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.047
And then there's that stretch of park
right by Maya's school--

05:39.131 --> 05:42.009
I wasn't planning on
hitting the pavements.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.595
What? Babe, we all gotta do our part.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.305
Are you getting signatures?

05:47.306 --> 05:49.224
No. I'm the candidate.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.976
That would really hurt my legitimacy.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.853
And plus, Simone and I are gonna
sit down and powwow some--

05:52.936 --> 05:54.354
some strategic ideas, so.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.898
I have Maya, babe. I--

05:55.981 --> 05:57.232
And a fucking life.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.109
You'll figure it out, I guess. Right?

05:59.193 --> 06:02.362
These crackers are incredible,
if I can just say that, so.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.947
I gotta dash out. Love you, okay.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.242
-All right, you ready?
-Yeah, let's go.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.453
Mommy.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.537
Coming.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.707
Hi, Greta. I'm so sorry to bother you.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.292
I was hoping for a favor.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.753
Is there any chance
you could watch Maya today?

06:17.836 --> 06:20.547
I hate to ask, but I have to collect
voter signatures for Danny.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.382
All hands on deck for the campaign.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.637
His opponent's in the pocket
of big business funded by John Breem.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.263
Los Angelization, here we come.

06:28.347 --> 06:32.226
And not to get all gnarly,
but the development would kill the wave.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.062
Nothing but malls and chain stores
up and down our beautiful coast.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.606
Any interest
giving a "fuck you" to the man?

06:37.689 --> 06:40.400
Say no to capitalist thugs, not drugs.
Am I right?

06:40.484 --> 06:42.361
I would love to, but I can't right now.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.780
But Danny and I both agree
that it should be legal.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.283
Danny's been arrested.
And he spent the night in jail.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.701
Yeah, we both did.

06:49.785 --> 06:53.789
Protesting the war of aggression
in Vietnam, and we'd do it again.

06:55.791 --> 06:59.378
There's tons of cool, young women.
It's a really happening vibe.

07:01.839 --> 07:06.134
It's like you're a better mom,
you have more patience, more time.

07:07.636 --> 07:11.181
Ten for him. None for you.
You're a total fucking bust.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.308
Jesus, please bless this food.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.853
Let it nourish and strengthen our bodies

07:15.936 --> 07:18.105
to help Timothy
handle the bullies at school

07:18.188 --> 07:21.400
who, I hope, find it in their hearts
to love him more.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.945
And help our volleyball team
crush Rancho Palmas tonight

07:25.028 --> 07:26.113
to clinch the Avocado League.

07:27.239 --> 07:32.619
And also, to give Mother the energy
to inspire the workers

07:32.703 --> 07:35.914
to construct her walk-in closet
correctly this time.

07:36.498 --> 07:42.713
And, of course, give Father
the courage and the foresight

07:42.796 --> 07:45.257
to keep building a better America

07:45.340 --> 07:50.846
where honest, strong and loving
families like ours come first.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.181
-Amen.
-Amen.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.225
Beautiful words, my son.

07:55.309 --> 07:59.646
I'm grateful to you for them,
and I am grateful for…

08:04.443 --> 08:05.736
For…

08:10.115 --> 08:12.201
What is he even praying for?

08:12.284 --> 08:14.328
He already owns everything
he lays his eyes on.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.538
How much money does one man need?

08:16.622 --> 08:17.706
For all of you.

08:18.749 --> 08:19.750
Let's eat.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.683
Bye.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.019
Eavesdrop much?

08:39.102 --> 08:42.731
No, I was just wanting to talk to you
about my class.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.567
What about it? You got ten students yet?

08:46.777 --> 08:50.405
Ten? Is that the number
that we've settled on?

08:50.489 --> 08:53.242
Well, has to be ten bodies or over
to make it worth my while.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.160
Great. No problem.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.703
And remember to get a solid ten,

08:56.787 --> 08:59.331
you gotta confirm 20
to account for the flake rate.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.796
Twenty? You barely had 20 people
to invite to your wedding.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.340
And Sheila,

09:09.091 --> 09:11.134
bring some damn toilet paper.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.098
If you don't have students,
you don't have a class.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.309
And if you don't have a class then
you might as well just be one of them.

09:23.105 --> 09:27.651
Shoveling chicken fried cheese,
fat noodle, pizza,

09:28.360 --> 09:33.782
doughnut, corn dog,
cream pie fat into your face

09:33.866 --> 09:36.702
until you're exploding all over your--

09:36.785 --> 09:38.161
What in God's name?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.747
Sweetie? What-- What are you doing here?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.040
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.877
Hey. We were on our way to the library.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.380
It was story time, I swear. And then
they got cranky 'cause I forgot snacks,

09:48.463 --> 09:50.299
and then I got cranky
'cause I forgot snacks.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.009
So we got snacks.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.052
That's not a snack.
That's two adult-sized meals.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.638
It's fine. Really.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.682
Are you here collecting signatures
in a leotard?

09:59.474 --> 10:00.642
No. I just…

10:01.643 --> 10:03.937
I was getting signatures
and then I had to--

10:04.021 --> 10:07.608
Well, I didn't have to, but--
It's kind of embarrassing.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.776
She's halfway through a corn dog.
You think she's judging you?

10:09.860 --> 10:12.196
I've been doing aerobics classes.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.614
Teaching, in fact.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.241
Starting tomorrow. I love it.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.368
You're teaching exercise classes.
That's amazing.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.745
You're amazing.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.332
I really love how it makes me feel awake.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.501
Yeah, right. That sounds great.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
Usually, I'm so tired.
I'm, like, half dead.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.299
One time, Ernie and I tried cocaine

10:33.300 --> 10:35.636
but it just ended up
making me hit the shitter.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.804
So I tried jogging.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.225
And then I thought about
stopping a lot, so I did.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.602
You should try aerobics.
You might like it.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.562
I should, right? Yeah, I might.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.774
You-- Do you think
I'd stick out like a sore thumb?

10:48.857 --> 10:51.485
She'll stick out like her fat ass.
You can't let this happen.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.569
No.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.154
Okay.

10:59.576 --> 11:03.830
I've counted 1,108 signatures.
I think-- I think we're good.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.958
Yeah, that is good.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.168
We're, you know,
we're about halfway there.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.712
What? Halfway? We--

11:10.796 --> 11:12.756
We only need a thousand
to get on the ballot.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.218
Yeah,
we need a thousand verified signatures.

11:16.301 --> 11:20.055
You need double that just to cancel out
any dupes or unregistered voters.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.391
But, yeah, we're close.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.102
You're not close. You're
right back where you fucking started.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.063
Oh, shit.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.858
-Honey, it's okay. It's okay.
-Oh, shit. Sweetie.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.777
-Take her away.
-I got it.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.821
It's okay. We can be done.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.328
She's crabby all the time lately.
Do you think something's wrong with her?

11:43.412 --> 11:44.997
No, kids just get crabby.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.249
You're just never here this much.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.792
Okay, well, she's not the only one.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.128
I mean, if there's a problem
with the signatures, I can--

11:51.211 --> 11:55.048
No, no, I just,
I know my daughter and she's fine.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.887
-Hey. Hi. Hey. Sorry, it was open.
-Hi.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.600
Oh, gosh. You guys make domesticity
look so fucking sexy, I swear.

12:05.976 --> 12:06.977
You want coffee?

12:07.060 --> 12:10.939
Yeah, I'd fucking murder for some coffee
and for some more clipboards.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.317
You know, I actually got
some of the marine bio heads

12:13.400 --> 12:14.985
to start collecting sigs for us,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
and I only barely had to use my sexuality.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.489
Barely. Did you hear that, Sheil?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.574
I did. Yeah.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.658
And it wasn't funny.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.410
Well, I mean, all hands on deck, right?

12:24.286 --> 12:27.289
Sheil, I was just wondering,
do you have any, like,

12:27.372 --> 12:29.499
I don't know, tennis friends
or, like, mom friends

12:29.583 --> 12:30.918
who would be willing to help us out?

12:31.835 --> 12:32.836
Yeah, let me think.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.671
Sheila's never had any female friends.

12:36.507 --> 12:37.799
That's not true.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.635
No, it's totally cool.

12:39.718 --> 12:40.719
It was just a thought.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.848
You know, I also struggle
to connect with other women as well.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.893
Or at least they struggled
to connect with me.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.981
I hope you like it sweet.

12:54.107 --> 12:54.983
Thank you.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.027
No students, no time.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.197
Just him and Simone.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.618
And Greta who moves like a puddle of mayo
will be the only one in class.

13:04.701 --> 13:08.288
And you won't even break a fucking sweat
in your old ass ballet shoes.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.875
Ballet shoes, ballet shoes, ballet shoes,

13:11.959 --> 13:14.878
ballet shoes, ballet shoes, ballet--

13:14.962 --> 13:17.506
I love your place. It's so atmospheric.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.759
You're the first student of mine
who hasn't been here.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.970
What brings you by now?

13:24.888 --> 13:28.392
I was so sad to see you
close your ballet studio!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.520
Did you find a new space yet?

13:32.104 --> 13:33.397
Nope. Nothing I can afford.

13:33.981 --> 13:38.068
Well, I was really at a loss
without your classes.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.783
Until I found aerobics at the mall.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.537
What mall? John Breem's new development?

13:48.620 --> 13:51.039
The man who pushed me out
and destroyed my business?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.917
I-- Maybe. I'm so-- I don't know.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.212
Yeah, of course it is. He's everywhere.

13:57.963 --> 14:02.134
Well, regardless,
I think you would really enjoy aerobics.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.262
It's inspired by ballet,
only the moves are faster.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.346
That's why I came by.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.057
I wanted to invite you, and also
any of your other former students

14:09.141 --> 14:11.602
if they may be interested, to my class.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.354
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're-- you're teaching a class?

14:14.438 --> 14:15.606
You're teaching a class?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.690
Yeah.

14:17.941 --> 14:18.942
Okay.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.613
I didn't know you liked people enough
to do that.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.448
What? No, I like people.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.826
I'm a big fan of people.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.871
You never said hello.
You never made eye contact, ever.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.124
I was probably concentrating on my form.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.503
So were all these people right here.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.006
And yet they remembered
that I exist afterwards

14:41.089 --> 14:43.050
and they still keep in touch.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.927
And not just because they want something.

14:46.887 --> 14:51.099
Not only did you never come
to any of my get-togethers,

14:51.183 --> 14:56.104
it was like you didn't even hear me
inviting you, you know?

14:56.188 --> 14:59.399
And my Cinco de Mayo parties
are, like, legend.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.151
I--

15:01.985 --> 15:04.738
I'm sorry. I have a daughter,
and I-- I'm full-time with--

15:04.821 --> 15:07.157
Sure, sure, sure. Parenting.
You invented it.

15:08.492 --> 15:09.993
Okay, Abigail.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.246
I've obviously offended you somehow
at some point,

15:12.329 --> 15:14.665
so I'll just see myself out.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.544
You know-- you know what?

15:19.253 --> 15:21.588
Word of advice on your new calling.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.342
Bitchy may play in LA
but not in the coastal communities.

15:25.884 --> 15:26.885
Okay?

15:27.386 --> 15:29.012
She's doling out advice?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.849
She's chugging colada
straight from the fucking blender.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.102
She doesn't deserve those contacts.
You do. See ya, bitch.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.528
Hi. It's Sheila Rubin from ballet class.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.614
The studio's been closed for weeks,
and, I mean, if you're like me,

15:47.698 --> 15:51.451
you probably feel a little lousy
without purpose, weighed down…

15:52.286 --> 15:53.996
And that's why you need my class.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.081
And that's why you need my class.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.916
And that's why you need my class.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.755
You'll be amazed
by how quickly it transforms you.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.092
After just one class,
you can feel it happening.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.719
You becoming you again.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.140
I'm wrangling and harnessing our power

16:13.223 --> 16:18.478
to influence every situation
with intention and purpose.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.355
If we can harness the strength…

16:20.439 --> 16:21.899
Holy shit, it's Jack.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.110
…of our animal nature,
our primal shriek, if you will.

16:25.194 --> 16:28.322
Wrangling it critically,
as only humans do,

16:28.405 --> 16:30.699
we can convert impulse to order
and streamline…

16:30.782 --> 16:31.992
Oh, God.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.745
You used to fuck
that bolo-tie-wearing buffoon.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.123
But first, and if I can address
the viewers at home,

16:38.874 --> 16:40.792
you need to admit it.

16:40.876 --> 16:42.294
Believe it.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.795
Is anyone really buying this shit?

16:43.879 --> 16:45.380
You have the power to carve your own path.

16:45.464 --> 16:50.719
You have the ability to be a visionary
who pushes us all forward.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.304
It all starts with you.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.517
-Is something funny?
-Excuse me?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.853
You seemed drawn to his teaching,
but then you laughed.

17:01.355 --> 17:06.568
Yeah. Well, I mean, no, I wasn't drawn.
I just, I know him in real life.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.614
You have one?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.451
What one? A husband?

17:14.535 --> 17:16.161
Yeah, I have a husband.

17:16.244 --> 17:17.412
I meant a color TV.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.957
I know you have a husband.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.961
Right, yes. The ring.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.253
Not the ring. I know who you are.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.798
You're Sheila Rubin.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.342
I saw the Save Our Wave coverage.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.594
Smart way to launch a campaign.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.432
But it won't be enough.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.893
You can't stop progress.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.771
Though I'm not sure you want to.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.947
I'm late. Bye.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.285
Guess what, Bill.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.954
I believed. And I took it.

17:59.580 --> 18:03.667
And I know you booked me on the show,
but this is something that I manifested.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.140
Right on.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.225
I have to take, like, an epic shit.
This is killer.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.270
-I'm happy to be of service.
-Right on.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.440
I gotta show you,
I sliced together some dynamic B-roll.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.026
Should be, like, truly impactful
for Save Our Wave.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.904
Yeah, sure. I'd love to see it.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.281
Right on. Wanna check it out after class?

18:34.364 --> 18:37.659
Yeah, well, I can't today,
but I could tomorrow.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.249
You know, I built this studio alone.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.045
I climbed over dicks and went through
asses because I had a dream.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.215
A clean studio
with a bitchin' sound system.

18:51.882 --> 18:54.259
If you screw this up, you're done here.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.053
You're not welcome back.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.721
Duly noted.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.237
You should've never let her come.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.780
She's gonna be destroyed.

19:15.447 --> 19:16.823
But here we go.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.493
Thank you all for coming.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.620
This is gonna be great.

19:23.914 --> 19:27.334
Just follow along and you'll--
you'll get it.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.516
I'm sorry. Does anyone know
how this-- these speakers work?

19:42.599 --> 19:44.268
You have to press "power."

19:49.773 --> 19:50.732
Thanks.

19:53.402 --> 19:54.903
Let's do this thing.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.659
Five, six, seven, eight.
To the right. Two, three.

20:00.742 --> 20:04.246
Sorry, so the-- Your left.
So let's do it again.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.915
Okay. I meant your left.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.878
Five, six, seven, eight. To the right.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.630
I mean, left. Sorry.
Let me do that again. Okay.

20:13.714 --> 20:17.176
Five, six, seven, eight. To the left.
Two, three.

20:17.843 --> 20:21.305
Back, two, three. Back, two, three.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.432
Back. To the right.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.601
To the left.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.520
And punch, and punch,
and sweep to the right.

20:28.604 --> 20:31.607
I meant left. Sweep, sweep.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.318
Toss, toss, toss. March it out.

20:35.611 --> 20:36.987
March it out. That's it.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.282
March it out.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.617
And out.

20:42.618 --> 20:44.870
That's right. And up.

20:45.787 --> 20:49.249
Two, up, up. One, two, up, up.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.044
One, two, up, up. One.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.754
That's it. Okay.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.758
You're nothing. Worse than nothing.

20:58.884 --> 21:02.012
You're a ghost. A fat ghost.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.642
The world's first fat fucking ghost.

21:06.725 --> 21:10.187
Fat fucking ghost.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.522
Fat--

21:11.605 --> 21:13.941
Don't look in my eyes. Look in yours.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.276
Find you.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.779
Every ugly thought
you've ever had about yourself,

21:18.862 --> 21:21.240
your body, your right to be here.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.033
Use it. Let it fuel you.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.955
Only you have the power to change you.
Are you ready to change?

21:29.665 --> 21:31.583
Starting right now.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.502
-Are you ready to change?
-Yes! Yes!

21:33.585 --> 21:35.128
Let's do this thing!

21:36.421 --> 21:38.757
Okay! Let's punch it out, ladies!

21:38.841 --> 21:41.802
Punch, punch, punch,
punch, punch, punch!

21:45.430 --> 21:46.431
Punch!

21:47.432 --> 21:49.518
Punch, punch, punch, punch!

21:52.020 --> 21:53.355
Great class, Sheila.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.815
Such a great class.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.609
Didn't think you could do that.

21:57.693 --> 21:59.528
I know. It helped.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.612
Nice to see that.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.948
People usually wanna be coddled
in this country.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.950
You're not from here?

22:05.033 --> 22:06.243
No one's from here, really.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.956
But if you want a teaching spot,
it's yours.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.126
Wow.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.586
And I should give you your cut.

22:21.675 --> 22:22.676
That's it?

22:22.759 --> 22:24.845
Well, I take 60%.

22:26.555 --> 22:29.266
You're using my moves, my studio.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.727
Welcome to America. None of this is yours.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.499
Hey.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.088
The first class is always the hardest.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.799
No. I'm not like you.

23:04.676 --> 23:05.928
I can't keep up…

23:07.638 --> 23:09.681
or blend in or wear a leotard.

23:09.765 --> 23:12.100
Oh, my God. I look like
a fricking beached whale.

23:12.184 --> 23:15.103
Once they're on the beach,
they're done for. Just leave her.

23:15.187 --> 23:16.522
I wanna, like--

23:16.605 --> 23:19.316
I wanna own my pain, you know?

23:19.399 --> 23:21.360
But I don't know, sometimes I--

23:28.242 --> 23:29.910
Sometimes I feel too much, right.

23:29.993 --> 23:33.121
Like, I-- I feel so low, like I'm nothing.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.629
I'm rambling. I'm sorry. You don't--

23:41.672 --> 23:43.048
You don't understand.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.510
How could you understand
something so pathetic?

23:46.593 --> 23:50.264
Don't do it. You can't tell her.
You can open that door.

23:50.347 --> 23:53.225
I could come to your house.
I could teach you aerobics there.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.187
No one else would see. Make you strong.

23:59.231 --> 24:01.024
Just don't give up.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.035
There they are.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.328
Hi, Daddy!

24:13.412 --> 24:15.497
-Hey, sweetie.
-So sorry I'm late.

24:15.581 --> 24:18.041
We got stuck running errands, and then…

24:18.125 --> 24:19.793
Thanks. And…

24:20.544 --> 24:22.504
there was a line at the store.

24:24.131 --> 24:25.632
Everything okay?

24:25.716 --> 24:29.595
Yeah, we tallied up the petitions,

24:29.678 --> 24:34.641
and we got over 2,000.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.768
I'm officially on the ballot!

24:36.852 --> 24:38.270
-Really?
-Yes.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.356
Oh, my God. Congrats.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.692
I couldn't have done any of this
without you. You know that, right?

24:44.443 --> 24:45.944
He doesn't believe that for a second.

24:46.028 --> 24:47.696
And I think you're right.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.865
Simone and her gang, they've been amazing,

24:49.948 --> 24:53.785
but we need more formal organization.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.580
We should bite the bullet.
Hire a campaign manager.

24:58.707 --> 24:59.958
Now?

25:00.042 --> 25:02.836
Shouldn't we wait
till we raise the money first?

25:02.920 --> 25:06.715
Well, no, just take it out of our savings.
And then the campaign will pay us back.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.177
Nothing wrong
with betting on yourself, right?

25:47.673 --> 25:49.341
Clap, punch, kick.

25:49.424 --> 25:51.176
Clap, punch, kick.

25:51.260 --> 25:55.389
Clap, punch, kick. Clap, punch, kick.

25:55.472 --> 25:57.516
Clap, punch, kick.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.393
Clap, punch, kick.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.646
Clap, punch, kick. Clap, punch, kick.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.064
Clap, punch, kick.

26:55.324 --> 26:56.325
You like it?

26:59.369 --> 27:02.164
I don't like it. I see it.

27:09.796 --> 27:10.756
Sheila.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.467
I think Maya…

27:16.970 --> 27:18.055
Sheil?

27:19.640 --> 27:20.933
Oh, God.

27:25.562 --> 27:26.688
Sheila.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.358
Sheila!
