CHRIS ROCK:
High school changes
everybody's life.

00:05.173 --> 00:08.042
After three years at Corleone,
I went to Tattaglia High.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.644
Now, I didn't know what
to expect when I got out,

00:10.678 --> 00:13.447
but I knew what to expect
when I went in.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.083
Get him!
White kids.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.617
(Power Station's
"Some Like It Hot" plays)

00:18.486 --> 00:22.022
And these weren't your everyday
white kids.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.093
They were bigger.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.529
They were faster.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.297
What the...?

00:31.432 --> 00:32.600
* Feel the heat

00:32.633 --> 00:34.602
They were stronger.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.171
* Pushing you to decide

00:37.205 --> 00:38.572
Hyah!

00:39.507 --> 00:42.643
* Feel the heat

00:42.676 --> 00:45.513
* Burning you up, ready or not

00:45.546 --> 00:47.281
And they were sexier.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.816
They had sexier backs.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.484
* When the heat is on

00:50.518 --> 00:52.386
They had sexier fronts.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.324
* Some feel the heat...

00:56.357 --> 00:58.259
Thank you, Lord.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.729
I had been the only black kid
at my school for three years,

01:01.762 --> 01:04.798
and I still wasn't ready
for what happened next...

01:07.601 --> 01:08.702
Nothing!

01:08.736 --> 01:09.837
Hey, you.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.207
What?

01:13.241 --> 01:14.642
How come you didn't punch me
a second ago?

01:14.675 --> 01:16.210
I don't even know you.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.711
That never stopped anyone
before.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.213
What the hell's your problem?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.581
In an ironic twist of fate,

01:20.614 --> 01:22.483
I was about
to get my ass kicked

01:22.516 --> 01:24.385
for expecting
to get my ass kicked.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.854
Nothing. It's just I'm the only
black kid here. I thought...

01:26.887 --> 01:27.888
What are you talking about?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.557
You're not
the only black kid here.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.892
Maybe the dumbest one,
but you're not the only one.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.435
Finally, I thought
my troubles were over.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.505
I wouldn't be
the only black kid on the bus.

01:46.174 --> 01:49.410
Yo, back of the bus, lady.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.847
I wouldn't be
the only black kid at lunch.

01:53.881 --> 01:58.386
*

02:01.422 --> 02:02.723
And for a change,

02:02.756 --> 02:05.826
I wouldn't be the only black
kid in my classes.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.574
Maybe these are all black kids
wearing whiteface.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.511
Who the hell are you?

02:23.544 --> 02:24.678
I'm Chris.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.248
Star of the new movie,
Guess Who's Coming to Homeroom.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.595
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.415
ROCK:
In a school that was
seven-percent Latino,

03:01.449 --> 03:03.417
nine-percent black
and three-percent Asian,

03:03.451 --> 03:07.488
I somehow ended up in a class
that was 99.9% white.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.891
Everybody take a seat,
take a seat.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.326
What are you
doing in here?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.828
It's my class.
You're Mr. Thurman, right?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.731
No, genius, I'm Mr. Magoo.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.434
You don't belong in here.

03:20.468 --> 03:21.535
Why not?

03:21.569 --> 03:22.703
You're black, you're black.
You're the black guy.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.673
I took a wrong turn
and ended up in South Africa.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.441
What's that got to do
with anything?

03:27.475 --> 03:28.809
You're gonna disturb my balance.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.644
You're like Crispus Attucks
in the Boston Massacre.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.380
Whatever happens in here,
good or bad,

03:32.413 --> 03:34.315
we're all gonna end up
talking about you.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.716
I'm doing it already
and I'm sick of it.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.718
Listen here, Mr. Magoo,
I would love to leave,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.787
but I ain't got nowhere else
to go.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.822
What's the matter? What are you,
what are you, Cuban?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.857
Hmm? Go ahead, sit
down, sit down.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.393
Don't touch anybody, huh?

03:45.426 --> 03:48.296
And it's Thurman.
Magoo's a joke.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.363
Hilarious.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.465
No, no, not here.
You people like to march, right?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.834
March your way to the back
of the class. Go ahead.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.806
He was afraid I'd bring
the property value

03:58.839 --> 04:00.641
of his classroom down.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.644
The hardest part about being
a black nerd

04:03.677 --> 04:05.579
was that I didn't fit in
with anybody.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.014
Not to mention,
before the Internet,

04:07.047 --> 04:12.320
there were only two black
nerds-- me and this guy.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.988
(Huey Lewis and the News'
"Hip To Be Square" plays)

04:15.022 --> 04:17.358
Officer, that's him!

04:17.391 --> 04:19.327
Black translation: run!

04:25.466 --> 04:27.501
Thank you, honey.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.902
All right.
What's wrong
with you, man?

04:28.936 --> 04:29.870
That wasn't funny!

04:29.903 --> 04:32.039
Dude, why'd you run?
You didn't do anything.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.441
Tell that to Emmett Till.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.742
I was scared.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.876
All the white people think

04:35.909 --> 04:37.778
I look like every
black person on Earth.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.847
I could go to jail
for anything

04:39.880 --> 04:40.814
from a parking ticket

04:40.848 --> 04:42.850
to throwing little baby
Jessica down the well.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.518
Dude, that didn't
even happen yet.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.653
I'm just saying.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.088
What you doing
down here?
We had a half day
today.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.023
I figured I'd try
and catch up with you.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.892
Is that coat the attire
for the Bronx Academy?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.093
Man, you wouldn't
believe it.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.929
I found the one place
on Earth where I'm
not a nerd.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.631
Where, in that coat?
The Bronx Academy.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.667
I'm the only one coming
from a public school.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.901
I'm, like, the toughest
kid there.

05:00.934 --> 05:01.735
Everyone's scared of me.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.704
Scared of you
or scared of that coat?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.839
This was the first time
Greg scared anyone

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
outside of a spelling bee.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.976
Is that blood
on that coat?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.043
Yeah. Cool, huh?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.345
No.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.680
Don't worry.
It's not mine.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.615
Not your blood
or not your coat?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.750
Yes and yes.
Want some cash?

05:16.784 --> 05:17.951
You kidding me?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.887
Take it, man. I can
get more tomorrow.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.889
Greg was like an ATM machine
with acne.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.724
So how's it over here?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.559
Same old, same old.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.596
I start my day like I always did
for the past three years:

05:28.629 --> 05:30.330
room full of white people.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.501
Hang in there, man.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.603
If there's anything
I can do for you,

05:35.636 --> 05:36.937
you let me know.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.105
Got any more of them coats?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.607
Sorry. I'll catch you later.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.513
While I dealt
with my new school,

05:45.546 --> 05:48.516
my mother dealt
with her own hairy situation.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.050
Hey, Mom,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.952
what happened
to your hair?

05:51.985 --> 05:54.755
That is not the way you give
a woman a compliment, Drew.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.123
I wasn't giving
a compliment, I was

05:56.156 --> 05:57.491
just trying to find
out what happened.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.560
Whatever happened,
it looks nice.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.629
What did happen?
Nothing happened!

06:01.662 --> 06:03.497
Something happened--
all the hair on

06:03.531 --> 06:05.599
the right side of
your head is missing.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.536
Maybe aliens came and
cut it so they could
put a probe in your ear.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.571
I do not have a probe in my ear.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.972
You sure?

06:12.005 --> 06:15.175
It's called an
"asymmetrical bob."

06:15.208 --> 06:16.544
Sounds alien to me!

06:16.577 --> 06:18.546
I got it done at Vanessa's shop.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.813
Wait, I thought it was
Pam's shop.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.516
Vanessa hit the number
and bought Pam out.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.518
Yeah, now I'm the new manager.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.587
What happened
to your old job?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.557
Something that hadn't happened
in a long time.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.559
I do not need this, okay?!

06:31.592 --> 06:34.094
My man has two jobs!

06:36.830 --> 06:39.467
Two jobs equals one finger.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.834
What you reading, baby?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.636
After Tonya's crush
on Billy Ocean ended,

06:42.670 --> 06:43.904
she got a new one

06:43.937 --> 06:47.207
on one of the top movie stars
of the time, Danny Glover.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.510
Danny Glover?
Didn't he play Benson?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.612
No, no, that was
Robert Guillaume.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.781
Danny Glover played the father
on Good Times.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.617
No, no, that's John Amos.
Danny Glover was Chicken George.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.718
No, that's Ben Vereen.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.653
Danny Glover's the voice
of Darth Vader.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.555
No, that's James Earl Jones.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.924
Danny Glover played "Mister"
in The Color Purple.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.125
ALL:
Oh...

07:05.158 --> 07:06.860
I thought
that was Whoopi Goldberg.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.597
His next movie is with some
white guy named Mel Gibson.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.599
Drew, what are you doing?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.667
Looking for a job.
Since I'm 13,

07:13.701 --> 07:15.636
I figured I'd start working
and make some real money.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.436
Well, you just remember,

07:16.470 --> 07:19.540
for now,
school is your first job.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.875
There's nothing wrong with
looking for your second job.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.044
If Drew gets a job,
can I have his allowance?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.078
No.
No.
No.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.213
So, how was school?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.681
Horrible.
Fine.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.584
How was your
first day, Drew?
Fine.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.186
His "fine" and my "fine"
were two different "fines."

07:33.220 --> 07:35.556
(Kool and the Gang's
"Celebrate" plays)

07:35.589 --> 07:37.558
* Whoo-hoo!

07:38.291 --> 07:40.260
* It's a celebration

07:40.293 --> 07:44.097
* Celebrate good times,
come on! *

07:44.131 --> 07:46.066
And they did that for Drew
every single day.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.970
Daddy, I wanted
to ask you something.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.605
Yes, baby?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.175
Can I get a job?

07:56.443 --> 07:59.747
This may have been the happiest
moment of my father's life.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.754
My baby wants a job!

08:06.787 --> 08:09.590
Get off of my
car, fool!

08:09.623 --> 08:10.924
I don't see why not.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.793
ROCHELLE:
I don't know, baby.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.661
You're only 12.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.696
You're a little too young
to be working.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.698
But Chris had a job
when he was 12.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.032
I had a job when I was two.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.736
Well, go do your homework,
and we'll talk about it
in the morning.

08:27.007 --> 08:27.741
What?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.209
:
What?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.111
I don't want Tonya working.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.614
She's still a little girl.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.882
This will be good for her.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.049
She'll be learning
responsibility

08:36.083 --> 08:37.818
and plus, she'll be making
a little money.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.252
What he really meant was...

08:39.286 --> 08:41.689
She'll be making money.
She'll be making money.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.692
She'll be making money
and she'll be making money!

08:44.725 --> 08:46.760
Well, where are we supposed
to find her a job?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.629
She can work at
the beauty shop
with you.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.797
She could
sweep up here.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.264
I don't want
her breathing
those chemicals.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.132
She can wear
a mask.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.934
When is she supposed
to do her homework?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.302
When she's not sweeping.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.638
What if she hears something
she's not supposed to?

08:57.671 --> 08:58.872
Don't tell me.
You really want her

08:58.906 --> 09:00.307
to work that bad?
Yes!

09:00.340 --> 09:03.711
No, but it's not me, it's her.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.846
Fine.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.849
Sweep up those crumbs.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.884
Tonya wants to work.
Let her do it.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.222
To get out
from under Mr. Thurman,

09:15.255 --> 09:17.324
I decided to go straight
to the top.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.592
Excuse me.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.662
Oh, my God! Chris!

09:21.695 --> 09:25.599
It'd be 20 yearsbefore another
woman had that reaction.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.867
Miss Morello,
you're the principal?

09:26.900 --> 09:27.935
How'd you end up here?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.903
You wouldn't believe it.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.306
I hate this school!
I hate these kids!

09:33.340 --> 09:37.144
And every last one of you
can kiss my white...

09:38.779 --> 09:40.080
As luck would have it,

09:40.113 --> 09:43.316
I ended up doing the same
thing over at Corleone.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.184
Only topless.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.787
So I took the job here.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.722
Come, come, come, sit.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.728
So, what can
I do for you?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.196
I need to change homerooms.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.998
Oh, what's the problem?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.833
Mr. Thurman hates me.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.702
Everyone does. It's in
the title of the show, dummy.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.871
I'm tired of being around
only white kids all the time.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.038
Doesn't bother Michael Jackson.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.207
Chris, I thought you'd like
that room.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.876
That's why
I had you placed there.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.012
You put me in that class?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.848
Yes, but if I had known
you were a racist...

10:14.882 --> 10:16.784
No, I'm not a racist.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.719
Well, I don't hear any of
the white kids complaining

10:18.752 --> 10:20.420
about being around you.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.089
It's hard to talk
when you're wearing a hood.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.858
And I think
that's mighty white of them.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.159
While I regain my composure,

10:26.193 --> 10:28.996
let's hear a word
from our sponsors.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.301
CHRIS ROCK:
Before I strangled her,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.403
I wanted to know
why she did what she did.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.438
Chris, when I saw your
name on the register,

10:38.471 --> 10:40.407
I thought, if you
hadn't gotten shot,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.142
ended up slinging rock,

10:42.175 --> 10:44.177
or become a baby daddy
over the summer,

10:44.211 --> 10:46.780
that you'd want
to get back to
something you knew.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.082
Yeah. I know black kids,
Asians, Latinos.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.318
So why can't I be
in the homeroom with them?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.887
Chris, the black boys
are all in gangs,

10:53.921 --> 10:55.689
the girls are all bougie,

10:55.723 --> 10:58.025
and don't even get me started
on the Puerto Ricans.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.193
Boriqua

11:00.227 --> 11:02.696
What have you got against
white people anyway?

11:02.730 --> 11:03.897
Oh, you'll find out.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.733
Nothing. I just don't want
to start every day

11:05.766 --> 11:07.334
in a roomful of people
who hate me.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.369
Tell you what.
If you can find
a black friend,

11:09.402 --> 11:11.905
or a group of people
that you can fit in with

11:11.939 --> 11:14.374
that aren't all white,
I'll put you in
a new homeroom.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.143
Serious?
As a heart attack.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.812
If I'm lucky, maybe
you'll have one before me.

11:18.846 --> 11:23.050
While I had a job to do,
my sister was going to work.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.985
Now, you remember what
I told you, Tonya, right?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.387
What happens in the beauty shop
stays in the beauty shop.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.822
That's my girl.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.824
Women need to know
this is a place

11:30.858 --> 11:32.893
where they can come
and say anything they want.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.995
Got it.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.165
Like every white basketball
player who makes the NBA,

11:38.198 --> 11:42.770
I had a tough job ahead of me:
I had to find black friends.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.938
I tried black guys.

11:44.972 --> 11:49.176
Uh... man, where
you get those clothes?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.780
Looking like page 32
of the Sears catalog.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.447
Hey, where's your football?

11:54.481 --> 11:55.916
Page 49.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.252
I tried
tender-headed black girls.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.190
Ow! Ow!

12:03.223 --> 12:04.391
Stupid!

12:04.424 --> 12:06.760
I even tried
the Black Student Union.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.495
You've been hoodwinked!
You've been had!

12:08.528 --> 12:11.164
You've been took! You've been
led astray! Run amok!

12:11.198 --> 12:13.033
You have been bamboozled!

12:13.066 --> 12:16.970
Hey! Get your hand
out of my pocket!

12:17.004 --> 12:19.072
Rest in peace, Talcum X.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.875
When my mother told Tonya

12:21.909 --> 12:23.844
she could say
anything she wanted,

12:23.877 --> 12:25.846
Tonya took her at her word.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.183
* Tonight I feel
the need for passion... *

12:30.217 --> 12:31.484
Did you dye
your hair blond

12:31.518 --> 12:33.854
or did you dye
your eyebrows black?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.923
Your perm looks nice,

12:35.956 --> 12:38.391
but what's wrong
with your toenails?

12:40.828 --> 12:44.097
Should you be using food stamps
to pay for this?

12:44.131 --> 12:49.202
* I want to see you,
I want to breathe you... *

12:49.236 --> 12:51.805
Vanessa, you need to
talk to that little girl.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.907
You think I don't
know I got a mole?

12:53.941 --> 12:55.976
Holy moley!
I know I got a mole.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.978
Does your mole know
about your mustache?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.546
What? Gloria, wait a minute!

13:01.081 --> 13:03.083
Tonya.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.052
What?

13:08.488 --> 13:09.957
I hate these guys!

13:09.990 --> 13:12.893
I frickin' hate them!

13:12.926 --> 13:13.994
All of them!

13:14.027 --> 13:17.564
Why did I ever take this job?

13:17.597 --> 13:19.032
Huh?

13:19.066 --> 13:20.067
You have to be crazy,

13:20.100 --> 13:21.835
have no friends, no prospects,

13:21.869 --> 13:24.504
and no reason to believe that
your life could be any better

13:24.537 --> 13:27.440
than to be tormented
and hated every day!

13:27.474 --> 13:29.076
Sounds like the perfect job
for me.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.511
I quit!

13:31.544 --> 13:34.181
Football team manager
was a horrible job,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.884
but if it was going to get
me away from Mr. Thurman,

13:36.917 --> 13:38.919
I'd work for the devil himself.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.889
What's going on out here?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.924
You're the coach?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.159
Make that
the white devil himself.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.232
I had a dilemma.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.466
To get out of Thurman's
homeroom,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.102
I had to get into
his locker room.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.070
What are you, the
one Hmm?
You going to

13:57.104 --> 13:59.339
integrate every room I'm in,
whether I like it or not?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.074
I'm here to apply
for team manager.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.476
At least the locker room
wasn't all white.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.378
Hi, Dickerson.
How's your ankle?

14:05.412 --> 14:06.880
It's good.
Who's this?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.315
That's Chris.
He wants to be

14:08.348 --> 14:09.249
the new team manager.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.051
What happened to that
skinny white dude?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.119
He quit.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.120
Hey...

14:13.153 --> 14:14.421
There you go.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.089
And don't be putting
no bleach in my drawers.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.925
I'm allergic.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.093
Who's that?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.162
That's Walter Dickerson,
our star running black.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.463
"Back."

14:23.496 --> 14:27.500
Hmm What

14:27.534 --> 14:28.635
Nothing.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.469
Give me one good reason

14:29.502 --> 14:31.338
why I should let
you be team manager.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.206
Because the last guy quit.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.641
Because I'm
the only one here.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.276
Don't be a smartass.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.978
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.047
Is Dickerson the only
black player on the team?

14:40.080 --> 14:42.515
Oh, for God's sake!
Now you want to get
on the team, too?

14:42.549 --> 14:43.716
What do you want to be?
A jockstrap?

14:43.750 --> 14:46.053
I guess you're just going
to black your way through life.

14:46.086 --> 14:46.853
Is that right?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.121
It didn't work
for Jesse Jackson,

14:48.155 --> 14:49.656
and it's not going
to work for you.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.025
Actually, it worked
for both of us.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.361
Let me tell you something.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.029
If you're going
to be around me,

14:56.063 --> 14:57.965
you need to
understand something.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.632
I don't like people.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.968
You forgot to say "black."

15:01.001 --> 15:02.569
Because people are idiots.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.305
They don't read, they don't
think, and they're lazy.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.507
If they can find an easier
way to do something,

15:07.540 --> 15:09.076
they'll take it every time.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.510
White people didn't have slaves
because they're racist.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.012
Yes, they did.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.546
They did it
because they're lazy.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.582
Lazyracists!
If they had gotten
off their butts

15:15.615 --> 15:17.084
and picked
their own damn cotton,

15:17.117 --> 15:18.718
they wouldn't have had
to shoot Dr. King.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.354
He's dead because
white people are lazy!

15:21.388 --> 15:23.290
And what do we do
to honor him?

15:23.323 --> 15:26.093
We take a damn day off work.
I'm sick of it!

15:26.126 --> 15:28.528
You want to get along with me,
don't be lazy.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.330
Or black.

15:30.363 --> 15:34.968
4:00. Be there. Every day.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.038
And don't be late.
You understand?

15:40.207 --> 15:43.476
And you're not
getting on this team.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.678
Thanks for the job, Coach!

15:45.712 --> 15:48.148
While I talked my way
into a job,

15:48.181 --> 15:49.649
Tonya talked her way
out of one.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.319
You gotta fire Tonya.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.254
Vanessa, let me
talk to her first.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.123
Rochelle,
I don't have time for that.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.258
I'm losing more customers
than a Muslim rib shack.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.292
Ah salaam a lick 'em!

15:59.326 --> 16:00.994
She broke up two marriages,

16:01.028 --> 16:02.062
she outed Jerome's uncle,

16:02.095 --> 16:03.563
and she told Gloria
about her mole.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.033
She told Gloria
about her mole?

16:06.066 --> 16:07.234
Oh, Lord! Not the mole!

16:07.267 --> 16:09.702
Everybody knows how sensitive
Gloria is about that mole.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.404
She ain't say nothing
about her mustache, did she?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.172
She didn't have to.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.107
Oh! Oh, Vanessa...

16:14.141 --> 16:17.210
Rochelle, either you fire her or
I'm going to have to fire you.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.481
Since me and Miss Morello
had a deal,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.316
it was time to pay the piper.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.417
Great. Thanks.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.420
Well, Chris,
you did it.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.522
I thought you had about
as much chance of working

16:29.556 --> 16:30.757
with the football team

16:30.790 --> 16:34.561
as Boy George does of joining
Quiet Riot, but you did it!

16:34.594 --> 16:37.164
And oddly enough,
so did Boy George.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.400
* Come on, feel the noise

16:40.433 --> 16:43.303
* Girls rock your boys

16:43.336 --> 16:46.706
* We'll get wild,
wild, wild... *

16:46.739 --> 16:48.575
Walter, I didn't
mean to doubt you.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.077
I just had to make sure

16:50.110 --> 16:52.779
Chris wasn't trying
to run game on me.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.515
That's cool. So can I go?

16:55.548 --> 16:59.186
Well, I guess. Yeah. Sure.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.560
So you going to move me
to a new homeroom?

17:07.594 --> 17:10.097
A deal is a deal.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.132
While my future was looking up,

17:12.165 --> 17:13.533
Tonya's was going
down the drain.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.269
I'm fired

17:16.303 --> 17:19.072
I swept up all the hair,
I cleaned out the shampoo bowls,

17:19.106 --> 17:20.673
I even picked up
those nasty toenail clippings.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.576
It's not that, Tonya.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.246
You know how
I told you that women need

17:26.279 --> 17:28.415
to be able to say anything
in the beauty salon?

17:28.448 --> 17:29.649
Yes.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.284
Well, baby,
there is a difference

17:31.318 --> 17:34.287
between saying anything
and saying everything.

17:34.321 --> 17:37.657
So I'm getting fired
for being honest?

17:37.690 --> 17:40.260
It happened to Don Imus.
It could happen to you.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.163
I'm sorry, but yes.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.767
You know what?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.370
I don't need this mess!

17:50.403 --> 17:52.639
My father has two jobs!

17:52.672 --> 17:54.807
Deja vu.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.213
My mother would have snatched
the naps out of Tonya's head,

18:00.247 --> 18:04.151
but at that moment,
she was just too proud.

18:04.184 --> 18:08.321
My new homeroom was a war zone
with no general in charge.

18:08.355 --> 18:09.889
Okay, settle down.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.228
You just going
to sit there?

18:15.262 --> 18:18.265
What do you want me to do?
I'm a teacher, not riot control.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.467
We need a Morgan Freeman
with a bat!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.901
You could
say something.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.704
I said, "Settle down."
You got a better idea?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.307
Rubber bullets?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.376
Yeah. You could...

18:29.409 --> 18:31.544
After five minutes
in my new homeroom,

18:31.578 --> 18:33.813
I learned being
in a class with Mr. Thurman

18:33.846 --> 18:35.448
would require character.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.151
Being in a class without him
required stitches.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.353
Chris, I'm not
doing this again.
Are you sure?

18:40.387 --> 18:41.421
I'm sure.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.360
THURMAN:
All right.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.462
Jameson Jones?
Here!
Here!

18:49.496 --> 18:51.331
What the hell you doing
back in here?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.865
I thought I
was done with you.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.168
I asked Miss Morello
if I could come back.

18:55.202 --> 18:58.371
For what? You wanted out.
I wanted you out. You're out.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.508
Your work here is done.
Come on, get the hell
out of here. Go, go.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.542
No. I'm staying.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.743
Why?

19:03.776 --> 19:05.678
See, if we're gonna be working
together,

19:05.712 --> 19:07.214
why should I avoid you?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.681
So whatever you got,
bring it.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.517
I might as well get used to it.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.752
Translation:
You might not like me,

19:12.785 --> 19:15.955
but those other guys
tried to kill me.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.325
What are you,
special, hmm?
A big

19:18.358 --> 19:21.694
Don't you eye-ball me.
I eye-ball you.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.830
Sit down.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.233
Aah!

19:26.266 --> 19:27.767
Up front.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.639
You wanted my
attention, you got it!

19:37.944 --> 19:39.912
I'll deal with that.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.649
Coming into Tattaglia, I
thought I would stand out

19:42.682 --> 19:44.884
because I was the
only black kid.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.220
But all I was was
just another teenager.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.389
If I wanted people to notice
me, I was actually

19:49.422 --> 19:52.459
going to have to do something
worth noticing.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.761
Not quite what I had in mind.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.430
Caruso

19:57.464 --> 20:00.333
I'm knocking you on the floor,
Bumpy. What's it look like?

20:00.367 --> 20:03.303
There's so many blacks here now,
I almost didn't recognize you.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.438
Well, feel free
to punch one of them.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.640
That's okay.
But thanks for the offer.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.876
Welcome to Tattaglia.

20:10.910 --> 20:15.915
* Everybody hates Chris...

20:30.530 --> 20:33.300
* Ah, make it funky now.
