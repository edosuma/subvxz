09:54.294 --> 09:56.694
Matter of fact, I have your
letter with me right now.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.930
Yeah, I'll take it up
with my staff

09:58.932 --> 10:00.398
First thing in the morning.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.733
Oh, not at all!

10:02.735 --> 10:04.802
It's what you sent me
to Washington to do.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.371
Now you take care.
[beep]

10:07.373 --> 10:09.874
[coughing]

10:09.876 --> 10:11.375
[retches]

10:32.331 --> 10:34.599
It's a good week
for indoor drownings.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.567
A senator this time...

10:36.569 --> 10:38.502
Honorable John Wilton,
of Missouri.

10:38.504 --> 10:40.838
Yeah, I heard.
Field office wants some answers.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.974
Is that a parking ticket?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.809
Why didn't your service plates
stop the...

10:44.811 --> 10:46.477
Yeah, I'll get that fixed.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.813
I got it running errands
last night.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.949
So I, uh, pulled
Wilton's phone records.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.952
His last conversation was with
a constituent... Harriet Evans.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.754
Wrote to him
about a zoning issue.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.322
Said he promised
he'd look into it.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.824
Yeah, that's the letter.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.559
I think she's gonna be
pretty disappointed

11:01.561 --> 11:03.361
With her senator's
follow-through.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.729
Oh, yeah.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.600
Salt.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.602
How's that?

11:11.604 --> 11:13.638
Nothing.
Uh, Pete and Elise

11:13.640 --> 11:16.040
Are interviewing
the senator's staff.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.509
We should get going.
Yeah, sure.

11:21.446 --> 11:24.649
Yes, the senator ruffled
some feathers, but...

11:24.651 --> 11:26.384
[crash]
[gasps] uh...

11:27.719 --> 11:29.887
Thank you.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.922
Please.

11:33.925 --> 11:37.495
Senator Wilton was one
of the natural-gas industry's

11:37.497 --> 11:39.930
Most ardent supporters.

11:39.932 --> 11:43.000
He and Mr. Tager
interacted on a daily basis.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.002
Then we'll need
the senator's calendar

11:45.004 --> 11:46.804
To compare with Tager's, ms...

11:46.806 --> 11:49.307
Uh, Diane Hewlett.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.409
I'm the senator's...

11:51.411 --> 11:54.345
Uh, I was
the senator's chief of staff.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.080
- I'll get the calendar.
- Thank you.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.948
Please don't let him touch
anything else.

12:00.519 --> 12:02.420
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.821
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.489
- So...
- So...

12:05.491 --> 12:06.590
So...

12:08.493 --> 12:09.827
- I know we said share...
- Promise to call

12:09.829 --> 12:11.562
- As soon as we get a lead...
- Share alike...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.564
We get it... yeah, we should
check with the field office.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.965
We're all good.
Okay, great.

12:14.967 --> 12:15.866
- Great!
- Awesome.

12:15.868 --> 12:16.801
Cool.

12:20.572 --> 12:23.341
So get this.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.343
I found dried salt
on senator's Wilton's car.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.844
Salt, sand...

12:26.846 --> 12:28.746
I think these people
are drowning in sea water.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.415
So what?
A violin from the <i>titanic,</i>

12:31.417 --> 12:33.084
A chariot wheel
from the red sea...

12:33.086 --> 12:35.720
[snaps fingers]
teddy Kennedy's turn signal.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.455
Huh.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.590
Look, I got, um, Artie
to overnight an artifact

12:39.592 --> 12:42.026
So we would have something
to counter the drowning effect.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.562
If we can stay ahead of this
guy and find out who's next.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.998
Now, Wilton and Tager were both
in favor of the same policies.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.633
Someone
doesn't like natural gas.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.068
You mean besides you?

12:51.070 --> 12:52.970
- I will cut you.
- Yeah.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.878
Did you know them?

13:00.880 --> 13:02.646
No. This is as close
as I got.

13:02.648 --> 13:03.981
I want to hear
what they're saying.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.916
We can't.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.852
We can only go where my memory
can take us.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.059
Listen, I've got to check
her gym locker still,

13:15.061 --> 13:16.560
But it doesn't look like

13:16.562 --> 13:20.064
It must be quite powerful
to have such a lasting effect.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.766
I want to discuss this
with the regents.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.435
Good. I'll finish up here
and meet you at the car.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.904
Arthur, remember,
she's highly volatile.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.173
Do not engage until we know
what we're dealing with.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.675
Right. Announce that
I'm a secret government agent,

13:31.677 --> 13:34.145
And the next object she hurls
might be me.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.446
Precisely.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.790
So do you take over Wilton's
seat now that he's gone?

13:45.792 --> 13:47.558
I will keep his office
functioning

13:47.560 --> 13:49.160
Until the governor
names a replacement.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.763
But I have no interest in being
the senator from Missouri,

13:52.765 --> 13:54.565
- If that's what you're asking.
- Why not?

13:54.567 --> 13:57.201
Power, money, prestige?

13:57.203 --> 13:58.769
No, thanks.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.438
I have done my time
in this town.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.773
This is the same copy of
the bill that Gavin Tager had...

14:02.775 --> 14:04.141
Fracking rights.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.544
Senator Wilton was one
of the cosponsors of the bill.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.979
Gavin was helping draft
the language.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.981
How many cosponsors are there?

14:10.983 --> 14:12.850
About ten other senators.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.585
Okay, we're gonna need
all their names,

14:14.587 --> 14:17.154
Right now, please.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.490
Ten senators,
ten possible targets.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.826
Yeah, all hands on deck.
I'm gonna call ted.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.961
I'm gonna do the same
with Elise.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.835
- Straight to voice mail.
- Yeah, her too.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.170
Mykes, why would
they turn their phones off

14:33.172 --> 14:35.739
If they were just stopping by
the field office?

14:35.741 --> 14:38.075
Why would they ever turn
their phones off?

14:38.077 --> 14:40.611
You know, earlier today,
ted was really evasive

14:40.613 --> 14:42.546
About this parking ticket.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.648
When I asked him about it,
he actually hid it away.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.750
Yeah, well, Elise refused
to go out with me,

14:46.752 --> 14:48.819
Said she had a thing.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.120
Pete, I hate
to even think this,

14:50.122 --> 14:52.089
But a pair
of secret service agents...

14:52.091 --> 14:55.259
They might be the perfect people
to commit these crimes.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.994
They had access
to the health club,

14:56.996 --> 14:59.663
To the senator, but why?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.031
We'll ask them
after we stop them

15:01.033 --> 15:02.266
From drowning
their next victim.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.101
Do you remember
where that ticket was from?

15:04.103 --> 15:06.103
Judiciary square.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.806
Pete, that's their car.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.841
Maybe the next victim's a judge

15:10.843 --> 15:13.043
Who's in favor of fracking.

15:20.051 --> 15:22.753
- In and out.
- Yeah.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.555
- Hands where I can see them.
- Oh...

15:24.557 --> 15:25.890
- Hold it right there.
- What the hell?

15:25.892 --> 15:27.925
- Wait. What are you guys doing?
- What's that, huh?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.661
Instruction label
from the first life raft?

15:30.663 --> 15:33.197
Wait.
What are you talking about?

15:33.199 --> 15:36.066
It's a certificate of marriage.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.068
- What?
- Um...

15:38.070 --> 15:40.771
They just got married
in the... in the courthouse.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.873
All right, fine.
Sorry.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.310
God, you guys have been acting
so weird, you know,

15:46.312 --> 15:48.712
Giving each other
all these signals and stuff.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.915
Yeah, you both had your
cell phones off during a case.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.583
Oh!
I get it.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.819
So that's, uh... that's why
you wouldn't go out with me.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.955
Yeah, that's why.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.723
Sorry.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.859
We just... we had to keep it
quiet, you know?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.794
I mean, you guys know
how the agency feels

16:03.796 --> 16:06.130
If two agents get involved
in a relationship.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.331
I hate to break this up, guys,

16:07.333 --> 16:08.999
But we're gonna have
to explain later.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.601
There's been another victim.

16:14.339 --> 16:16.340
Oh, boy.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.742
Oh, my god.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.011
- This is...
- Claire, come on, let's go.

16:23.014 --> 16:25.049
No. You said we were just
going for a walk.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.684
- Honey, come on.
- No!

16:26.686 --> 16:28.252
You're sending me away.
I'm not going.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.921
Please, honey, we just want
you to talk to a doctor.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.656
No one's sending
you away, baby.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.091
You're lying, both of you.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.360
Please, honey,
just get in the car.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.162
No.
I don't believe you.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.798
I'm not going anywhere
with you!

16:40.800 --> 16:42.800
- L-listen, we s... we should go.
- No, Artie.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.234
You... really, you don't know.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.203
I do.
I need to see this.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.771
All right, you know what?
That's it.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.007
- I've had enough.
- No!

16:59.851 --> 17:01.018
[gasps]

17:23.907 --> 17:27.176
I remember coming in
to find out if you were okay.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.412
[door opens]

17:32.384 --> 17:36.120
Hi.
You're Claudia, right?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.956
Something bad happened,
didn't it?

17:41.660 --> 17:44.428
You d... you didn't see
anything, did you?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.430
I heard it.
It sounded bad.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.032
Huh.

17:50.368 --> 17:53.070
It was the music box,
wasn't it?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.139
It made Claire mad.

17:56.441 --> 17:58.142
Frances farmer's music box.

18:01.012 --> 18:03.147
H-how did you know?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.082
I just knew it was bad.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.817
You're right.
It was.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.419
It was very, very, very bad.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.755
And you are
a very special girl.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.429
Did you find
the artifact, Arthur?

18:20.198 --> 18:23.801
Frances farmer's music box
causes telekinetic outbursts...

18:23.803 --> 18:25.936
Triggered by anger.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.806
Uh, I've given Claire
a sedative.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.041
She must come with us.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.311
And I've asked the neighbor
to watch Claudia

18:34.313 --> 18:37.781
Until a relative arrives.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.952
Claudia, do... do you have
a-a favorite toy?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.821
Would you run and go get it?

18:47.358 --> 18:50.160
She intuitively recognized
the artifact.

18:50.162 --> 18:52.062
Rare.

18:52.064 --> 18:55.966
We must keep our eyes on her.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.269
She's a very special girl.

19:01.973 --> 19:04.508
What happened to Claire?

19:04.510 --> 19:07.111
The music box...
it infected her.

19:07.113 --> 19:10.247
But it was destroyed, so we had
no artifact to neutralize.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.182
So it stayed in her
permanently.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.751
We tried everything.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.352
We tried artifacts,
antipsychotics...

19:15.354 --> 19:16.820
Nothing worked.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.057
The only solution
was to put Claire

19:20.059 --> 19:22.226
In an artifact-induced coma.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.762
I wanted you to see
we had no choice.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.463
Is Claire being like this
my fault?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.799
Artie, did I throw the music box
into the fire?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.501
You weren't in the room.
It's not in your memories.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.103
Claudia, it doesn't matter.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.505
It matters to me!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.340
I want to see things
from my memories now.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.408
Oh, what possible difference
could it make?

19:43.782 --> 19:44.982
[gasping]
you guys okay?

19:44.984 --> 19:46.784
You were starting
to get pretty agitated.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.218
What happened?
Why'd we come out?

19:48.220 --> 19:49.853
Claudia,
I think it was your mind

19:49.855 --> 19:51.121
That was blocking the memories.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.456
Remember, it's a very
emotional day for you.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.158
You lost... you...

19:59.397 --> 20:01.098
All right,
so let me talk to my partner,

20:01.100 --> 20:02.266
And I'll get back to you, okay?

20:02.268 --> 20:04.234
Thanks.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.839
Hey. So the guy's name
is Freddy Olin.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.874
He's a real-estate investor.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.943
He bought and sold
high-end listings.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.979
Now, his assistant said
he was on the phone with a buyer

20:15.981 --> 20:18.182
When he said, and I quote...

20:18.184 --> 20:21.852
[imitates choking]

20:21.854 --> 20:24.354
- Any connection to the others?
- No.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.956
No, the guy's not political.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.225
I asked his assistant
where Freddy stood on fracking.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.327
She thought I meant
on <i>Battlestar</i> and giggled.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.863
So ted and Elise
aren't the only thing

20:32.865 --> 20:35.365
We were completely
wrong about today.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.069
Yep.
We're two for two.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.971
How'd we miss it?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.440
Well, good partners
are good partners.

20:45.210 --> 20:46.577
Let's go.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.418
So, um, until about a year ago,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.386
- This guy was a bartender.
- Yeah, worked at the pool bar

20:56.388 --> 20:58.422
At the palladium hotel.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.524
From frozen margaritas
to a cheesy McMansion...

21:00.526 --> 21:02.226
That's a pretty big jump.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.228
God, the palladium hotel
sounds familiar.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.129
Yeah, that's where we talked
about putting up your mom.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.065
- No, that's not it.
- Yeah, it is.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.466
We were gonna put her up
at the other one.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.034
- I know the other one was...
- No, remember, I told you

21:11.036 --> 21:13.036
- She doesn't like the pools.
- Yeah, the other place,

21:13.038 --> 21:15.272
- Then we went to the palladium...
- Guys, guys!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.507
Can we just go check it out?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.176
- Yeah.
- Sure.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.911
- It was the...
- It was not the same one.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.279
- It was the same one.
- She said that she wanted...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.514
- And also, she said that she...
- No...

21:24.516 --> 21:28.485
No, no, no, Freddy...
he just up and quit one day.

21:28.487 --> 21:31.188
He kept talking about a big
inheritance from his aunt.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.522
Lucky bastard, right?

21:32.524 --> 21:35.392
Well, I mean, you know,
until today.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.461
- Uh, Pete?
- Yeah?

21:39.364 --> 21:41.932
Wow.
Nice place.

21:51.142 --> 21:52.342
[both clearing throats]

21:52.344 --> 21:54.278
Hey, you got a...?
Diet coke, please...

21:54.280 --> 21:55.612
- Ice cold.
- Yeah.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.147
- Thank you, Dolores.
- Thanks.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.649
Hmm.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.984
So how did you and ted happen?

22:00.986 --> 22:03.153
Oh, uh, I don't know.
We were partners for years.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.123
And then one day we kind of just
looked at each other and went,

22:06.125 --> 22:07.424
"wow.
We're partners."

22:07.426 --> 22:09.293
It just made sense.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.428
We had a shorthand.
We had each other's backs.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.264
We're the most important person
in the world to each other.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.400
And then I had a kind of scare.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.402
A scare?
What kind of scare?

22:18.404 --> 22:20.470
Um, I thought I was pregnant.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.672
Oh.
[laughs]

22:21.674 --> 22:23.573
I mean, oh...
I wasn't.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.142
- Right.
- You know?

22:25.144 --> 22:26.977
But it just makes you
reevaluate your priorities.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.712
Like, what do you want in life,
you know?

22:28.714 --> 22:30.314
Yeah.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.549
So we decided to tie the knot.

22:32.551 --> 22:36.286
Wow. Seriously, dude,
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.588
And, uh, I promise you,
your secret is safe with us.

22:38.590 --> 22:39.957
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Yeah.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.658
So how about you guys?

22:41.660 --> 22:43.627
I mean, come on,
anybody can feel that vibe.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.062
- What?
- Yeah.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.296
- Me and Mykes?
- Yeah!

22:46.298 --> 22:47.965
No.
[laughs]

22:47.967 --> 22:50.233
No.
Seriously, no.

22:50.235 --> 22:53.470
I mean, we care
about each other, but...

22:53.472 --> 22:55.472
No. No, no.
All I'm saying is,

22:55.474 --> 22:57.674
That's what we said,
and one day you just wake up,

22:57.676 --> 22:59.509
You realize
exactly what you want

22:59.511 --> 23:01.278
Is staring you
right in the face.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.279
Hey.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.513
Hey.

23:05.049 --> 23:06.650
- What?
- What?

23:06.652 --> 23:08.185
Nothing.

23:10.321 --> 23:12.990
- What?
- Nothing.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.124
All right.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.692
- Oh, my god.
- Elise?

23:15.694 --> 23:17.227
That's it.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.762
That's... that's what familiar,
the logo.

23:20.698 --> 23:22.399
- Yeah, honey, 'cause this is...
- Do not start.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.001
She does not like pools.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.469
The room service here
is fantastic.

23:25.471 --> 23:27.037
Hey, guys, wait.
This hotel...

23:27.039 --> 23:29.072
It was in the news
about year ago...

23:29.074 --> 23:32.142
Some sort of political scandal.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.044
Pete, come on.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.445
- See?
- And your mom was gonna...

23:35.447 --> 23:36.713
Ow!

23:38.416 --> 23:41.685
So Julia Helmsworth
disappeared last summer.

23:41.687 --> 23:44.221
An anonymous tipster
said that they saw her here

23:44.223 --> 23:46.390
Partying at the hotel pool

23:46.392 --> 23:48.525
With her boss,
senator Dean Kelton.

23:48.527 --> 23:52.729
The media went bananas,
and they said that they thought

23:52.731 --> 23:54.598
That he was either
sleeping with her

23:54.600 --> 23:57.367
Or there was blackmail
or that maybe he killed her.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.369
Yeah, but it was
all speculation,

23:59.371 --> 24:02.239
Even though it ended up
ruining his life.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.074
I mean,
I-it broke up his marriage.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.809
He lost the reelection

24:05.811 --> 24:07.677
And eventually
he killed himself.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.112
Right.
And our dead bartender,

24:09.114 --> 24:10.814
Aka anonymous tipster,

24:10.816 --> 24:14.217
Got his inheritance
at the same time.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.153
Whoa, Mykes.
Check this out.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.221
Senator Wilton, the guy
they found dead in his car...

24:18.223 --> 24:19.823
- Yeah.
- He's the same guy

24:19.825 --> 24:23.326
Who won that election
and took over Kelton's seat.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.296
So our victims

24:26.298 --> 24:28.598
Ruined Kelton
to win an election,

24:28.600 --> 24:31.401
And someone
I-is taking them out.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.837
Yeah, but who's
the next victim?

24:33.839 --> 24:36.139
Uh...

24:36.141 --> 24:39.476
I'm gonna bet on
Nancy Malloy...

24:39.478 --> 24:42.712
The reporter
that broke the story first.

24:42.714 --> 24:44.714
Artie, I want to talk.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.316
What do you want?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.551
Take me to the real Claire.

24:47.553 --> 24:49.286
I want to use the baby shoes
with her.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.687
Her memories can tell me
what happened.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.689
No!
Absolutely not.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.691
It's too dangerous.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.327
In perfect condition, the shoes
can cause a psychotic break.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.695
We have no idea
how they'll interact

24:58.697 --> 25:00.330
With a mind like Claire's.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.266
- Artie, you started this.
- To finish it...

25:03.268 --> 25:05.302
And to show you
that some things, Claudia,

25:05.304 --> 25:06.837
Just can't be fixed.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.538
- What aren't you underst...
- Claudia...

25:08.540 --> 25:10.307
[clears throat]

25:12.176 --> 25:14.744
Through no one's fault,

25:14.746 --> 25:18.415
I have been completely deprived
of my own history,

25:18.417 --> 25:20.784
The truth about who I am
and where I come from.

25:20.786 --> 25:23.386
I'll leave it alone
after this, I promise,

25:23.388 --> 25:25.489
But I need to know
what happened.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.826
All right, listen,
w-what about this?

25:29.828 --> 25:33.663
Would you at least agree
to letting me go instead of you?

25:33.665 --> 25:36.433
And I'll take the risk,
and I'll tell you what I find.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.136
No, no.
I need to see this for myself.

25:39.138 --> 25:41.371
Well, then how I'm supposed
to keep you safe?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.906
Keeping me safe
is not your job.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.708
Yes, it is!

25:44.710 --> 25:46.443
It is precisely my job!

25:46.445 --> 25:48.678
- I'll go!
- What?

25:48.680 --> 25:49.713
No!
Why?

25:49.715 --> 25:50.847
- No. What?
- Artie.

25:50.849 --> 25:52.149
Artie, I was thinking
that maybe,

25:52.151 --> 25:53.450
Whether you meant it or not,

25:53.452 --> 25:54.818
It's possible
that you blocked Claudia

25:54.820 --> 25:56.853
From seeing those memories
to protect her...

25:56.855 --> 25:58.889
Subconsciously.
Subconsciously.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.757
Now...

26:00.759 --> 26:03.160
I would be a neutral party.

26:04.362 --> 26:05.762
Uh...

26:05.764 --> 26:07.230
Uh...

26:07.232 --> 26:08.565
I'll take that as a yes.

26:11.335 --> 26:13.670
[door beeping]

26:23.614 --> 26:25.248
What is all this?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.717
Joseph Pilate's
resistance bands...

26:27.719 --> 26:29.686
They keep
her circulation active,

26:29.688 --> 26:31.788
And they keep her muscles
from atrophying.

26:34.859 --> 26:36.826
Oliver sacks' record player...

26:36.828 --> 26:40.197
That's what keeps her
in a perpetual coma.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.865
Is she conscious,
like in the bronzer?

26:41.867 --> 26:44.334
No, no. As far as we know,
she doesn't even dream.

26:47.738 --> 26:51.341
This was the most humane thing
we could do.

26:58.382 --> 27:00.317
What exactly
are you insinuating?

27:00.319 --> 27:03.453
We are not... we are not
insinuating anything, lady.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.488
We're saying it outright.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.791
Freddy Olin was paid
to be your anonymous source.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.993
Look, your life
may be in danger.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.895
Someone is getting revenge.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.599
Wilton, Tager, Freddy Olin...
they're all dead.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.601
We're trying to keep you
from being next.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.936
Sorry.
You're out of luck.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.905
I was just reporting a story.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.673
And if there was
some vast conspiracy

27:23.675 --> 27:25.609
Against senator Kelton,

27:25.611 --> 27:27.410
I had nothing to do with it.

27:27.412 --> 27:29.512
Now, if you'll excuse me...

27:29.514 --> 27:30.981
[coughs]
I have to get ready.

27:33.851 --> 27:36.786
- Mykes, she's drowning.
- Pete...

27:47.331 --> 27:49.966
Silver from the mine's
of the Atacama desert.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.534
- It's the driest place on earth.
- Okay.

27:51.536 --> 27:53.370
- Okay, just breathe.
- Good, good, good.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.438
- Okay.
- You're gonna be fine, okay?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.774
Just breathe.
Okay.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.643
Good.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.814
But why'd she start drowning
at that moment?

28:04.816 --> 28:06.483
I mean,
no one did anything to her.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.452
There was no artifact on her.
She was just talking.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.488
Maybe it was something
she said.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.024
The last thing that she said

28:14.026 --> 28:15.625
Was that she didn't know
anything

28:15.627 --> 28:17.327
About the conspiracy, right?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.362
Right, which I'm betting
is a total lie.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.564
A lie.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.600
A lie.

28:23.602 --> 28:27.470
There was a-a letter
in... in Wilton's car.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.340
He promised this woman
he would look into an issue,

28:30.342 --> 28:31.808
And then he tore it up.

28:31.810 --> 28:34.544
Pete, maybe it's triggered
by lying.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.746
Well, that would be
a perfect artifact, right?

28:36.748 --> 28:38.748
'Cause the perp wouldn't even
have to be around

28:38.750 --> 28:39.949
- When it happened.
- Right.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.351
Um, guys, can you just hold up?

28:41.353 --> 28:42.519
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.054
Nancy, we think
that you were attacked

28:44.056 --> 28:46.690
With sort of a, um...
a truth serum

28:46.692 --> 28:49.392
That reacts to your
nervous system when you lie.

28:49.394 --> 28:53.096
Yeah, so do you want to tell
us the truth this time?

28:53.098 --> 28:55.031
Okay, Freddy Olin
was paid to say

28:55.033 --> 28:58.001
That he saw senator Kelton
at the hotel with a girl.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.737
Were you paid too?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.472
Okay, good.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.707
Now, tell us who paid you,

29:03.709 --> 29:05.742
Because we think
they're next on that list.

29:07.478 --> 29:10.747
Hewlett, his chief of staff.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.948
No one thought

29:11.950 --> 29:13.483
That senator Kelton
would kill himself.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.485
We were... we were just trying
to win an election.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.987
So that's why you're retiring?

29:17.989 --> 29:20.423
[sighs] I don't have
the stomach for it anymore.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.058
And what
about Julia Helmsworth,

29:22.060 --> 29:23.793
The girl who disappeared?

29:23.795 --> 29:26.896
No idea.
Dead, for all I know.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.799
Wilton and Tager and I heard
about her disappearance,

29:29.801 --> 29:32.102
And we saw it
as an opportunity.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.603
Oh, god.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.138
All right.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.006
Now, we are gonna secure
this office,

29:37.008 --> 29:40.377
And you are gonna tell me
who else knew what you did

29:40.379 --> 29:42.145
So that we can find this guy.

29:45.649 --> 29:48.485
Claire...

29:48.487 --> 29:51.154
I don't know if you can hear me

29:51.156 --> 29:53.022
Or if this is even gonna work,

29:53.024 --> 29:57.761
But I need to see something
maybe only you know.

29:57.763 --> 30:00.930
So, if you can hear
any of this,

30:00.932 --> 30:03.933
Try to focus on the music box.

30:03.935 --> 30:07.036
I need to see what happened
to the music box.

30:07.038 --> 30:08.571
I'll be monitoring her vitals.

30:08.573 --> 30:09.906
First sign of trouble,

30:09.908 --> 30:12.509
I'm pulling you both out,
understood?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.010
I'll make sure
we get home okay.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.483
All right.

30:34.432 --> 30:35.932
Where are we?
Did it work?

30:35.934 --> 30:37.066
I-I don't know.

30:37.068 --> 30:40.537
This looks like
some kind of yard sale.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.606
Claire,
is this the right place?

30:43.608 --> 30:46.042
Hey, don't electrocute
yourself, okay?

30:46.044 --> 30:48.077
I'm the one
who's gonna get in trouble.

30:48.079 --> 30:50.146
I don't need you to protect me.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.015
I'd know that 'tude anywhere.

30:57.788 --> 30:59.489
Fixed it.

31:13.771 --> 31:15.171
It's the music box.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.607
It worked.
Claire took us here.

31:21.011 --> 31:23.813
Claire, that thing's bad.
You should put it down.

31:23.815 --> 31:27.550
No, it's not bad, Claudia.
It's just old.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.118
I want to see if it works.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.963
Claire.
Claire, put it down.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.832
I don't like it.
[music box playing]

31:42.834 --> 31:44.901
Well, good.
Then you'll leave it alone.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.604
[chuckles]

31:47.606 --> 31:50.206
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

31:58.215 --> 32:00.116
Here you go, sweetheart.

32:00.118 --> 32:02.519
Thanks.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.087
What, you're still not done
with that?

32:04.089 --> 32:06.656
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you did the eye-roll thing

32:06.658 --> 32:08.291
When I said
I remembered the hotel.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.093
I did not do
the eye-roll thing.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.528
You so did!
I'm just sorry

32:11.530 --> 32:12.962
That you feel threatened
when I'm right.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.164
- You want to hit me again?
- Kind of.

32:18.068 --> 32:21.004
You know, I am so glad
that we have boundaries.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.805
Work is work,
and personal's personal.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.073
It's much better that way.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.909
Boundaries, yep.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.310
We work together every day

32:27.312 --> 32:30.680
And live next to each other
in a b&b.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.916
You know, I still wish that
you would close your bathrobe

32:32.918 --> 32:34.183
In the morning.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.718
That's involuntary, Myka, okay?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.220
All guys wake up like that.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.329
Is that a weapon?

32:46.331 --> 32:49.165
A long time ago.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.234
It's just a souvenir now.
See?

32:55.839 --> 32:59.676
Veterans affairs
gave it to me years ago.

32:59.678 --> 33:03.680
I guess I'm just thinking
about more honorable times.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.815
All right, well, just, uh...

33:05.817 --> 33:08.785
Just don't turn this
into a suicide watch, hmm?

33:08.787 --> 33:10.753
Don't worry about me.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.890
That hotel

33:13.892 --> 33:15.925
Is also where we talked
about putting up your mom.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.760
[laughs]
had to have the last word.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.796
Don't think I didn't catch
that thing between you and Pete.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.831
What? That was before
we even knew each other.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.633
And what about you?
You were ogling girls

33:23.635 --> 33:25.268
At the pool, like,
before the ink had even dried

33:25.270 --> 33:27.270
On our marriage certificate.
I was not!

33:27.272 --> 33:30.073
[coughs, wheezes]

33:30.075 --> 33:33.009
Ted, ted.

33:38.315 --> 33:39.882
Hey!

33:41.619 --> 33:43.720
[ted gags and wheezes]

33:51.095 --> 33:52.762
This is
special agent Elise Meyer.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.764
I need an ambulance
at the Russell building.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.666
Got an agent down.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.941
[ted gasping, wheezing]
Hewlett took off.

34:07.011 --> 34:10.746
- What is that?
- Something that will help him.

34:17.187 --> 34:19.422
Ted, listen to me.
I need you to relax.

34:19.424 --> 34:23.960
Okay, now, did Hewlett do
anything... anything strange?

34:23.962 --> 34:27.697
Did she have
any strange objects?

34:27.699 --> 34:28.931
[hoarsely]
part of sword...

34:28.933 --> 34:31.266
Broken, just the hilt,

34:31.268 --> 34:34.203
Military, ceremonial.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.304
Just the hilt.

34:38.175 --> 34:39.809
Okay.
Breathe.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.745
- Pete?
- Just the hilt, right?

34:42.746 --> 34:44.213
There's a little statue
in Paris.

34:44.215 --> 34:47.050
It's, like,
world war I-ish, right?

34:47.052 --> 34:48.384
I saw it a few years ago.

34:48.386 --> 34:50.987
It's, uh, uh, Alfred, uh...

34:50.989 --> 34:52.955
- Alfred Dreyfus?
- Yes.

34:52.956 --> 34:54.956
Falsely accused of spying...
the Dreyfus affair.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.092
That's right.
That's right.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.862
And during the ceremony where
they stripped him of his rank,

34:59.864 --> 35:01.397
They snapped his sword in half.

35:01.399 --> 35:06.102
Now, the... the statue is of him
holding this broken sword.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.704
- Right.
- But I can't figure out

35:07.706 --> 35:09.739
The connection
to the salt water.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.775
He was imprisoned
on devil's island for ten years.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.311
The only escape
was a nine-mile ocean swim.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.180
Okay, hello?
Hey!

35:17.182 --> 35:21.084
So you're saying that a...
that a broken old sword

35:21.086 --> 35:23.219
Is what made ted almost drown?

35:23.221 --> 35:24.921
- No.
- Yes.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.223
- Yes.
- No?

35:27.225 --> 35:29.125
Should I ignore the fact that
that just sounds insane?

35:29.127 --> 35:31.794
Uh...

35:31.796 --> 35:34.430
I mean, you're welcome
to giggle a little.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.266
But it's... it's true.
[clears throat]

35:37.268 --> 35:39.802
Okay, let's say we buy that.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.337
You're also suggesting

35:41.339 --> 35:44.073
That Hewlett is killing
her cohorts. Why?

35:44.075 --> 35:46.109
Remorse.

35:46.111 --> 35:49.112
She said that she didn't have
the stomach for it anymore.

35:49.114 --> 35:53.349
Well, why now?
And why attack ted?

35:53.351 --> 35:55.251
My guess is,

35:55.253 --> 35:56.486
Is that she needed
to finish the job.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.955
There still must be
someone out there

35:58.957 --> 36:01.257
- That she needs to punish.
- That girl.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.993
What girl?

36:03.995 --> 36:06.162
From the paper...
um, uh, Julia...

36:06.164 --> 36:07.096
Both:
Helmsworth.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.164
Yeah.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.467
Myka, maybe she's still alive.

36:14.538 --> 36:16.272
[car horn honks]

36:32.523 --> 36:35.224
Honey, we're sure your
teachers are exaggerating.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.059
They're lying.
It makes no sense.

36:37.061 --> 36:38.995
We just want you
to talk with someone.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.496
You're sending me away.

36:40.498 --> 36:43.533
You don't like me anymore,
so you're getting rid of me.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.034
It's the music box.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.136
The music box
is making Claire bad.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.939
Everything's fine, sweetie.
Just put on your sweater.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.507
We're gonna go
for a little drive.

36:51.509 --> 36:53.409
No, you're lying to me.

36:53.411 --> 36:57.180
- [groaning]
- Claudia, look.

36:57.182 --> 36:59.916
Maybe she doesn't want to be
here anymore.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.151
Just a little bit
longer, Claire.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.586
I'm not going.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.588
We'll stay with you
the whole time.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.156
You'll come right home.
You'll see.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.257
No.

37:10.961 --> 37:14.230
Please, Claire,
the music box is hurting you.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.567
Who cares
about the stupid music box?

37:21.939 --> 37:23.606
There, now it's gone, okay?

37:33.116 --> 37:35.251
What the hell happened?
You were all shaking.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.620
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't my fault.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.489
Claire threw the music box
into the fire herself.

37:40.491 --> 37:42.525
Oh, thank god.

37:44.261 --> 37:46.329
She stayed, though.

37:48.398 --> 37:50.366
Even though she was in pain,

37:50.368 --> 37:53.603
She stayed long enough
to show me.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.275
Okay, thank you.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.510
Hey, um, I just talked
to Reagan general.

38:01.512 --> 38:04.413
Nancy Malloy's lungs are slowly
filling back up with fluid.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.250
Okay, you're gonna have to
split the time with the necklace

38:07.252 --> 38:10.386
Between Nancy and ted
and just stick by him.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.189
Couldn't get rid of me
if he tried.

38:16.660 --> 38:20.062
All right, now,
Hewlett has to have some intel

38:20.064 --> 38:22.999
About Julia Helmsworth here.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.400
- Right.
- Hey, hey, ted.

38:24.402 --> 38:27.303
Where did she get the hilt?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.906
Right there, desk drawer.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.411
- Here we go.
- Okay...

38:35.413 --> 38:38.247
Here.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.516
Ah, ha ha ha!

38:40.518 --> 38:42.485
- Paper trail-a-palooza.
- Okay.

38:42.487 --> 38:46.322
We have meetings
with Wilton and Tager

38:46.324 --> 38:48.925
And payoffs to Malloy
and the bartender.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.259
- Mykes?
- Yeah?

38:50.261 --> 38:53.296
Checks made out
to Julia Helmsworth.

38:53.298 --> 38:55.698
Bingo.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.401
- Julia, it's okay.
- Someone knows, don't they?

38:58.403 --> 39:00.670
You know, I never wanted to be
a part of this.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.538
You people forced me into it.
That's why I'm here.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.040
Go and pack a bag.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.542
I'm going to take you
someplace safe.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.312
Julia, you trust me, don't you?

39:11.014 --> 39:13.482
- Freeze, Hewlett!
- Who are you?

39:15.018 --> 39:17.353
Julia, don't say another word.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.689
Hewlett, come on out, okay?

39:19.691 --> 39:22.224
There's no place else to go.

39:22.226 --> 39:24.994
It's okay.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.963
I'm coming out.

39:31.401 --> 39:32.468
Hewlett!

39:35.005 --> 39:37.473
I'm innocent.
I haven't hurt anyone.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.678
[gagging]

39:42.680 --> 39:44.714
Hewlett!
[thud]

39:57.461 --> 39:59.328
Mykes, grab it.

40:09.706 --> 40:11.540
Liar.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.543
Well, sorry
you couldn't punish yourself.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.313
I guess we'll see
what a jury can come up with.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.056
So ted and Elise wrote
in their report

40:27.058 --> 40:29.759
That Hewlett used
an unidentified toxin

40:29.761 --> 40:31.560
On her victims.

40:31.562 --> 40:34.597
Yeah, well, you know,

40:34.599 --> 40:39.502
We keep their secret,
and they shall keep ours.

40:39.504 --> 40:42.505
[giggles]
sir.

40:46.209 --> 40:47.510
Good.
All right.

40:47.512 --> 40:52.048
All right, so,
hey, Mykes, um...

40:52.050 --> 40:56.419
Speaking of partners who,
you know, work things out...

40:56.421 --> 40:57.720
- Pete.
- What?

40:57.722 --> 40:58.821
- No.
- Don't...

40:58.823 --> 41:00.056
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait,

41:00.058 --> 41:01.824
- Wait, just... just...
- I...

41:01.826 --> 41:03.592
Hear me out.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.361
Okay.

41:06.730 --> 41:10.232
Look, I know that I...

41:10.234 --> 41:12.201
Joke around a lot.

41:13.670 --> 41:16.205
But, um...

41:16.207 --> 41:18.274
In regards
to this whole baby thing,

41:18.276 --> 41:22.445
I just...
I just wanted to tell you...

41:22.447 --> 41:26.215
You know, for real, just once,
so that you know...

41:29.486 --> 41:33.456
Look, Mykes, you... you are
the most important person

41:33.458 --> 41:35.257
In my life.

41:35.259 --> 41:38.294
So, if you ever want to,
you know,

41:38.296 --> 41:42.364
If you ever want to talk
seriously...

41:42.366 --> 41:46.535
About any version of...

41:50.674 --> 41:54.844
You know, uh...

41:54.846 --> 41:56.645
We can do that.

41:58.582 --> 42:00.216
Or not.
I'm, uh...

42:00.218 --> 42:02.184
I mean, I could be wrong, okay?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.787
I-I won't mention it again.
I got to go. Bye.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.403
I know Artie
says he tried everything,

42:21.405 --> 42:24.173
And he means well...

42:25.542 --> 42:27.343
But you're my sister...

42:32.315 --> 42:35.551
And there's no way
I'm leaving you like this.
