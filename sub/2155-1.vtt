<i>When I was a kid,
whenever I'd feel small or lonely...</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:47.048
<i>...I'd look up at the stars.</i>

00:47.799 --> 00:50.009
<i>Wondered if there was life
up there.</i>

00:51.094 --> 00:53.930
<i>Turns out I was looking
in the wrong direction.</i>

00:54.681 --> 00:59.519
<i>When alien life entered our world it was
from deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:02.939
<i>A fissure between two tectonic plates.</i>

01:03.856 --> 01:06.401
<i>A portal between dimensions.</i>

01:07.485 --> 01:08.945
<i>The Breach.</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:13.866
<i>I was 15 when the first Kaiju
made land in San Francisco.</i>

01:40.518 --> 01:43.563
<i>By the time tanks,
jets and missiles took it down...</i>

01:43.813 --> 01:46.274
<i>...six days and 35 miles later...</i>

01:46.649 --> 01:47.692
<i>...three cities...</i>

01:47.942 --> 01:48.693
<i>...were destroyed.</i>

01:50.069 --> 01:51.321
<i>Tens of thousands...</i>

01:51.571 --> 01:52.989
<i>...of lives were lost.</i>

01:57.619 --> 01:58.202
<i>We mourned...</i>

01:58.453 --> 01:59.203
<i>...our dead...</i>

01:59.454 --> 02:00.614
<i>...memorialized the attack...</i>

02:01.497 --> 02:02.624
<i>...and moved on.</i>

02:08.086 --> 02:10.548
<i>And then, only six months later...</i>

02:11.090 --> 02:12.175
<i>...the second attack...</i>

02:12.425 --> 02:13.968
<i>...hit Manila.</i>

02:14.218 --> 02:15.928
<i>The acid factor of the Kaiju blood...</i>

02:16.179 --> 02:18.389
<i>...creates a toxic phenomenon
named Kaiju Blue.</i>

02:18.890 --> 02:20.725
<i>And then the third one hit Cabo.</i>

02:21.643 --> 02:23.269
<i>And then the fourth.</i>

02:23.519 --> 02:24.399
<i>And then we learned...</i>

02:25.063 --> 02:26.773
<i>...this was not gonna stop.</i>

02:27.023 --> 02:28.191
<i>This was just the beginning.</i>

02:30.485 --> 02:31.277
<i>We needed...</i>

02:31.527 --> 02:32.278
<i>...a new weapon.</i>

02:33.071 --> 02:34.111
<i>The world came together...</i>

02:34.322 --> 02:36.449
<i>pooling its resources
and throwing aside...</i>

02:36.699 --> 02:37.825
<i>...old rivalries...</i>

02:38.076 --> 02:39.535
<i>...for the sake of the greater good.</i>

02:41.079 --> 02:42.914
<i>To fight monsters...</i>

02:43.164 --> 02:45.249
<i>...we created monsters of our own.</i>

02:46.417 --> 02:47.257
<i>The Jaeger program...</i>

02:47.502 --> 02:48.753
<i>...was born.</i>

02:50.421 --> 02:52.423
<i>There were setbacks at first.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:54.634
<i>The neural load to interface...</i>

02:54.884 --> 02:57.679
<i>...with a Jaeger proved too much
for a single pilot.</i>

02:58.805 --> 03:00.890
<i>A two-pilot system
was implemented.</i>

03:01.140 --> 03:04.936
<i>Left-hemisphere, right-hemisphere
pilot control.</i>

03:05.186 --> 03:06.688
<i>We started winning.</i>

03:08.398 --> 03:10.066
<i>Jaegers stopping Kaijus
everywhere.</i>

03:11.317 --> 03:13.486
<i>But the Jaegers were only as good
as their pilots.</i>

03:14.904 --> 03:15.664
<i>So Jaeger pilots...</i>

03:15.905 --> 03:17.115
<i>...turned into rock stars.</i>

03:17.365 --> 03:18.116
<i>Danger...</i>

03:18.366 --> 03:19.617
<i>...turned into propaganda.</i>

03:20.660 --> 03:21.327
<i>Kaijus...</i>

03:21.577 --> 03:22.328
<i>...into toys.</i>

03:25.456 --> 03:26.874
<i>We got really good at it.</i>

03:28.042 --> 03:28.710
<i>Winning.</i>

03:33.256 --> 03:34.507
<i>Then...</i>

03:35.049 --> 03:35.717
<i>Then it</i> all...

03:35.967 --> 03:37.051
<i>...changed.</i>

03:38.761 --> 03:42.056
Gipsy Danger <i>report to Bay 08, level A-42.</i>

03:42.306 --> 03:46.060
<i>Kaiju. Code name: Knifehead.
Category 3. 8700 metric tons.</i>

03:46.310 --> 03:48.187
Yo, Yancy, wake up! Movement...

03:48.438 --> 03:49.439
...in the Breach.

03:49.689 --> 03:53.401
- Hey, come on! We're being deployed.
- Great.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.820
- Good morning.
- Morning.

03:56.571 --> 03:59.365
Kaiju's a Category 3, biggest one yet.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.201
Code name: Knifehead.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.620
- What time is it?
- Two.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.373
Yep.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.752
What do you say?
Fifth notch on the belt?

04:12.795 --> 04:14.088
Come on, Beckets.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.590
Time for the drop.

04:17.091 --> 04:17.841
Hey, kid.

04:18.091 --> 04:18.801
Yeah?

04:19.260 --> 04:20.803
Don't get cocky.

04:22.555 --> 04:23.681
<i>Years before...</i>

04:23.931 --> 04:27.351
<i>you wouldn't have picked my
brother Yancy and I for heroes.</i>

04:27.602 --> 04:29.187
<i>No chance.</i>

04:29.437 --> 04:32.023
All right, let's
suit up and kick some ass!

04:33.024 --> 04:35.067
<i>We were never star athletes.</i>

04:35.318 --> 04:37.153
<i>Never at the head of the class.</i>

04:37.779 --> 04:40.656
<i>But we could hold our own
in a fight.</i>

04:40.907 --> 04:42.200
<i>And it turned out we had...</i>

04:42.450 --> 04:43.618
<i>...a unique skill:</i>

04:43.868 --> 04:45.912
<i>We were Drift compatible.</i>

05:03.054 --> 05:04.347
<i>Data on helmet.</i>

05:04.597 --> 05:08.935
<i>Data relay gel
dispersing in circuitry suit.</i>

05:36.420 --> 05:37.880
<i>Good morning, Becket boys!</i>

05:38.130 --> 05:41.133
- Tendo, what's happening, my man?
- How'd that date with Alison...

05:41.384 --> 05:42.593
<i>go last night, Mr. Choi?</i>

05:42.844 --> 05:44.887
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.014
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

05:47.265 --> 05:49.600
<i>Ha, ha. A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, brother.</i>

05:49.851 --> 05:51.269
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.854
Engaging drop, sir.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.107
Marshal Pentecost on deck.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.237
Securing the Conn Pod.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.527
Getting ready to drop.

06:02.113 --> 06:03.906
Conn Pod door lock secure.

06:06.492 --> 06:07.932
- Release for drop.
<i>- Gipsy Danger...</i>

06:08.119 --> 06:09.159
...ready for the big drop.

06:11.873 --> 06:13.040
- Here we go.
- Yeah!

06:13.291 --> 06:14.625
<i>Here we go!</i>

06:24.552 --> 06:25.792
Coupling confirmed, sir.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.889

06:28.389 --> 06:30.099
<i>Engaging now.</i>
<i>Pilot to-pilot connection...</i>

06:30.349 --> 06:31.601

07:08.638 --> 07:09.518
<i>Gipsy Danger...</i>

07:09.597 --> 07:10.765
- ...ready and aligned, sir.
<i>- Rangers, this is Marshal...</i>

07:11.015 --> 07:13.517
...Stacker Pentecost.
Prepare for neural handshake.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.061
Starting in 15 seconds.

07:16.062 --> 07:17.313
Fourteen...

07:18.356 --> 07:19.357
...thirteen...

07:19.607 --> 07:21.859
<i>...twelve, eleven, ten.</i>

07:22.109 --> 07:23.945
Ready to step into my head, kid?

07:24.195 --> 07:26.155
Please, after you. Age...

07:26.405 --> 07:27.990
...before beauty, old man.
<i>- Pilot-to-pilot connection...</i>

07:28.240 --> 07:29.909

07:30.159 --> 07:33.287
<i>Neural handshake initiated.</i>

07:34.830 --> 07:36.191
<i>The Drift.</i>

07:36.374 --> 07:37.792
<i>Jaeger tech.</i>

07:38.042 --> 07:41.170
<i>Based on DARPA jet fighter
neural systems.</i>

07:41.879 --> 07:44.423
<i>Two pilots, mind-melding
through memories...</i>

07:44.674 --> 07:47.051
<i>...with the body
of a giant machine.</i>

07:47.301 --> 07:48.970
<i>The deeper the bond...</i>

07:50.137 --> 07:51.722
<i>...the better you fight.</i>

07:53.808 --> 07:54.934
Neural handshake...

07:55.184 --> 07:56.185
...strong and holding.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.689
<i>Right hemisphere is calibrating.</i>

08:00.106 --> 08:01.146
Left hemisphere...

08:01.148 --> 08:02.066
...calibrating.

08:04.694 --> 08:05.361
<i>Proofed...</i>

08:05.611 --> 08:06.988
<i>...and transmitting.</i>

08:16.664 --> 08:17.665
<i>Gentlemen, your orders...</i>

08:17.915 --> 08:19.625
...are to hold the miracle mile
off Anchorage. Copy?

08:19.875 --> 08:20.755
<i>Copy that, sir.</i>

08:20.960 --> 08:23.629
Sir, there's still a civilian vessel
in the Gulf...

08:23.879 --> 08:25.381
You're protecting a city
of two million people.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.832
You will not risk those lives
for a boat that holds ten.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.007
<i>- Am I clear?</i>
- Yes...

08:29.135 --> 08:31.303
- ...sir.
- Man, that's cold.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.890
You know what I'm thinking.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.350
I'm in your brain.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.019
- I know.
- Then let's go fishing.

08:38.936 --> 08:39.602
Here we go!

08:39.854 --> 08:42.313
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!

08:42.898 --> 08:45.192
Worry about yourself, kiddo!

08:55.536 --> 08:58.456
<i>There are
things you can't fight, acts of God.</i>

08:58.706 --> 09:00.499
<i>You see a hurricane coming...</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:02.126
<i>you have to get out of the way.</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:05.004
<i>But when you're in a Jaeger, suddenly...</i>

09:05.254 --> 09:07.423
<i>you can fight the hurricane.</i>

09:07.673 --> 09:08.966
<i>You can win.</i>

09:13.804 --> 09:15.014
Get them tied down...

09:15.264 --> 09:18.059
...and go down below! Now!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.438
How far to the mainland?

09:22.688 --> 09:24.190
Seven miles off Anchorage, sir.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.400
But we won't even make it
past the shallows.

09:26.650 --> 09:27.610
No, we won't!

09:27.860 --> 09:30.321
What about that island
three miles east?

09:30.571 --> 09:32.448
No! It's two miles, sir.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.867
One mile, sir!

09:35.117 --> 09:36.702
It's getting closer.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.532
How the hell...

09:38.746 --> 09:40.122
...can it be getting closer?

09:44.835 --> 09:46.128
Kaiju.

09:54.345 --> 09:55.930
Harder starboard!

09:56.180 --> 09:56.972
Turn her around!

09:57.223 --> 09:58.474
Now!

10:19.120 --> 10:20.955
- Oh, God!
- What the hell?

10:40.808 --> 10:41.600
Hang on!

10:41.851 --> 10:43.018
<i>Ship secure.</i>

10:43.269 --> 10:44.979
- Adjust the torque!
- I'm on it.

10:46.147 --> 10:47.106
<i>Torque locked.</i>

11:27.605 --> 11:28.772
Get him. Come on.

11:29.023 --> 11:30.624
<i>- Shoot him.</i>
<i>- I'm on it! I'm on it!</i>

11:41.452 --> 11:42.373
<i>Discharge reading, sir.</i>

11:42.411 --> 11:43.579
Plasma cannon in the shallow shelves...

11:43.829 --> 11:44.997
...seven miles off the coastal line.
<i>- Gipsy...</i>

11:45.247 --> 11:47.416
<i>...what the hell is going on?</i>
- Job's done, sir.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.044
Lit it up twice. Bagged our fifth kill.

11:50.294 --> 11:53.172
- You disobeyed a direct order!
<i>- Respectfully, sir...</i>

11:53.422 --> 11:55.174
...we intercepted a Kaiju...

11:55.424 --> 11:56.384
...and saved everyone...

11:56.634 --> 11:58.514
<i>- ...on that boat.</i>
- Get back to your post. Now!

11:59.887 --> 12:01.722
Yes, sir.

12:01.972 --> 12:02.893
Kaiju signature rising!

12:06.143 --> 12:07.978
That thing's still alive, sir.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.188
<i>Gipsy!</i>

12:09.438 --> 12:10.814
<i>We're still getting a signature!</i>

12:12.483 --> 12:14.443
<i>That Kaiju is still alive!</i>

12:15.236 --> 12:17.154
<i>Grab the boat and get out of there.</i>

12:17.738 --> 12:18.405
<i>You copy?</i>

12:19.698 --> 12:22.159
<i>Grab the boat
and get out of there now!</i>

12:30.709 --> 12:31.390
Take it, Raleigh!

12:31.627 --> 12:32.428
I got this!

12:42.096 --> 12:43.305
Loccent, we're hit!

12:47.977 --> 12:48.686
Left arm's...

12:48.936 --> 12:50.104
...gone cold, sir.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.506
The hull! It
went through the hull!

13:10.833 --> 13:11.713
Raleigh, listen to me!

13:11.917 --> 13:12.751
You need... Aah!

13:17.172 --> 13:18.632
No!

13:18.882 --> 13:19.925
No!

13:52.791 --> 13:54.168
<i>Loading.</i>

14:12.936 --> 14:15.736
Second discharge fried all the comms,
sir. I'm not getting any signals.

14:20.069 --> 14:21.612
No signatures, sir.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.075
What do we do now, sir?

14:29.953 --> 14:32.998
Now, I want you to keep your eye
on that gauge there.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.751
Now, you know what I'd like to find?

14:36.001 --> 14:39.421
I'd like to find a whole ship.
That's what I'd like to find.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.257
Wait, wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Wait!

14:42.508 --> 14:44.343
Right there, right there! Dig!

14:46.095 --> 14:47.596
Hey, what is it?

14:48.597 --> 14:50.516
It's just an old toy.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.268
We never find anything good.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.646
Listen.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.824
Oh, my God.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.181
Stay here!

15:53.036 --> 15:54.288
Mister?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.500
Can I help?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.010
Yancy.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.387
Yancy.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.520
Run! Get help, fast!

16:19.271 --> 16:21.815
It's gonna be all right.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.238
<i>The Kaiju are learning our defenses.</i>

17:09.488 --> 17:12.156
<i>They're adapting. Evolving.</i>

17:12.491 --> 17:15.243
<i>And we're losing Jaegers faster
than we can build them.</i>

17:16.369 --> 17:17.371
<i>Lima.</i>

17:17.829 --> 17:19.205
<i>Seattle.</i>

17:19.748 --> 17:21.165

17:21.791 --> 17:23.210
<i>Category 4 Kaijus...</i>

17:23.460 --> 17:24.940
<i>...are now coming through the Breach.</i>

17:25.170 --> 17:27.923
<i>I think even you can see,
marshal, this is no longer...</i>

17:28.173 --> 17:29.299
<i>...a sound strategy.</i>

17:29.550 --> 17:31.510
<i>The frequency of the attacks
has increased.</i>

17:31.760 --> 17:35.889
<i>The Jaegers are not the most viable
line of defense anymore.</i>

17:36.139 --> 17:37.140
I am aware.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.018
Those are my rangers that die...

17:40.269 --> 17:41.603
...every time a Jaeger falls...

17:41.853 --> 17:43.272
...which is why I'm asking you...

17:43.522 --> 17:45.363
...for one last chance.
<i>- Excuse me, marshal.</i>

17:45.607 --> 17:48.235
One final assault
with everything we've got.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.237
<i>The Jaeger program is dead, marshal.</i>

17:50.487 --> 17:52.239
<i>On the other hand, the coastal wall...</i>

17:52.489 --> 17:54.324
<i>program is a promising option.</i>

17:54.866 --> 17:57.536
<i>The world appreciates
all that you and your men have done...</i>

17:57.786 --> 17:58.662
<i>...but it's over.</i>

17:58.912 --> 18:01.164
<i>We will authorize you to take
all remaining Jaegers...</i>

18:01.415 --> 18:03.709
<i>...to the last battle statio: Hong Kong.</i>

18:04.334 --> 18:05.502
<i>We're prepared to fund you...</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:07.421
<i>...for the next eight months
while the coastal wall...</i>

18:07.671 --> 18:08.797
<i>...is completed.</i>

18:09.047 --> 18:11.800
<i>After that, you will receive
no further support.</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:13.927
<i>You have your answer, marshal.</i>

18:16.888 --> 18:17.689
So that's it?

18:19.516 --> 18:20.601
It's over?

18:21.518 --> 18:23.103
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.814
That's all they are, Stacker.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.154
We don't need them.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.549
Eight hundred more beams.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.887
Ration cards, guys! Come on, come on!

18:57.137 --> 18:58.221
Let's go!

18:59.389 --> 19:03.226
Now, I got good news and I got
bad news, fellas. Which one...

19:03.477 --> 19:05.187
- ...you wanna hear first?
- Bad news!

19:07.564 --> 19:10.317
Three guys died yesterday
working the top of the wall.

19:11.485 --> 19:14.154
- What's the good news?
- The good news is...

19:15.197 --> 19:17.199
...I got three new job openings.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.034
Top of the wall.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.204
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?

19:22.996 --> 19:24.373
<i>Come on!</i>

20:06.123 --> 20:08.083
<i>I am here in Sydney, where earlier today...</i>

20:08.333 --> 20:10.877
<i>yet another Kaiju attack took place.</i>

20:11.128 --> 20:13.714
<i>The Kaiju, an enormous Category 4...</i>

20:13.964 --> 20:15.632
<i>...broke through the coastal wall...</i>

20:15.882 --> 20:17.300
<i>...in less than an hour.</i>

20:21.221 --> 20:24.433
<i>The Wall of Life had been deemed
unbreachable by its builders.</i>

20:24.683 --> 20:25.563
Why the hell...

20:25.600 --> 20:27.144
...are we even building this thing?

20:27.978 --> 20:30.772
That thing went through the wall
like it was nothing.

20:31.022 --> 20:31.940
<i>Ironically, it was...</i>

20:32.190 --> 20:34.735
<i>...the recently decommissioned Jaeger,</i>
Striker Eureka...

20:34.985 --> 20:35.861
<i>piloted by Herc...</i>

20:36.111 --> 20:37.779
<i>...and Chuck Hansen that finally...</i>

20:38.029 --> 20:39.030
<i>...took the beast down.</i>

21:02.763 --> 21:05.390
<i>Look, they decommissioned
the Jaeger program...</i>

21:05.640 --> 21:07.520
<i>...because of mediocre pilots.
It's that simple.</i>

21:07.768 --> 21:11.062
<i>That's Striker Eureka's tenth kill
to date. It's a new record.</i>

21:11.730 --> 21:14.941
<i>And you're still going to Hong Kong,
even at a time like this?</i>

21:15.192 --> 21:17.903
<i>Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?</i>

21:23.992 --> 21:25.994
<i>Chuck Hansen,
one of the pilots...</i>

21:26.244 --> 21:27.204
<i>...of Striker Eureka...</i>

21:27.454 --> 21:29.748
<i>...the Jaeger that took down the Kaiju.</i>

21:37.464 --> 21:38.799
Mr. Becket.

21:39.049 --> 21:39.716
Marshal.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.676
Looking sharp.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.178
Long time.

21:43.762 --> 21:45.347
Five years, four months.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.724
Can I have a word?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.479
Step into my office, marshal.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.524
Took me a while to find you.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.567
Anchorage, Sheldon Point, Nome...

21:57.818 --> 21:58.985
Yeah, a man in my position...

21:59.236 --> 22:02.155
...travels with the wall,
chasing shifts to make a living.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.740
What do you want?

22:06.159 --> 22:10.080
I've spent the last six months activating
everything I can get my hands on.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.959
There's an old Jaeger, a Mark 3.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.545
You may know it. It needs a pilot.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.588
I'm guessing I wasn't your first choice.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.383
You are my first choice.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.302
All the other Mark 3 pilots are dead.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.059
Look...

22:32.894 --> 22:36.064
...I can't have anyone else
in my head again.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.400
I'm done.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.445
I was still connected to my brother
when he died.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.448
I can't go through that again, man,
I'm sorry.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.368
Haven't you heard, Mr. Becket?

22:50.745 --> 22:52.664
The world is coming to an end.

22:53.915 --> 22:54.755
So where would you...

22:55.000 --> 22:55.959
...rather die?

22:56.209 --> 22:59.296
Here, or in a Jaeger?

24:07.948 --> 24:09.240
Mr. Becket...

24:09.491 --> 24:10.784
...this is Mako Mori.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.410
One of our brightest.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.663
Also in charge of the Mark 3
restoration program.

24:15.622 --> 24:19.292
She personally handpicked
your copilot candidates.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.173
Hey.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.147
At ease.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.176
We will tour the facility first...

24:43.400 --> 24:45.610
...and then Miss Mori will show you
to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.

24:45.860 --> 24:46.611
- Wait for us, please!
- Hold the door...

24:46.861 --> 24:48.222
- ...please!
- Thank you.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.198
Thank you. Thank you.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.456
Stay back. Kaiju specimens
are extremely rare...

24:55.704 --> 24:56.663
...so look but don't touch, please.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.207
Mr. Becket, this is our research team.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.459
Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Geiszler.

25:01.710 --> 25:02.752
Oh, no, call me Newt.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.963
Only my mother calls me Doctor.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.205
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.982
I have asked you not to refer to me
by my first name around others.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.414
I am a doctor with over 10 years
of decorated experience...

25:13.596 --> 25:14.723
Ten years! I'm very sorry.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.254
- Oh, please.
- Who is that...

25:17.350 --> 25:18.268
...Yamarashi?

25:18.518 --> 25:21.187
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.

25:21.438 --> 25:24.315
My brother and I took him down in 2017.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.606
You know he was one of the biggest
Category 3s ever?

25:26.776 --> 25:29.154
He was 2500 tons of awesome.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.041
Or awful. You know,
whatever you wanna call it.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.455
Please excuse him. He's a Kaiju
groupie. He loves them.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.499
Shut up, Hermann, I don't love them,
okay? I study them.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.627
And unlike most people, I wanna see
one alive and up close one day.

25:46.755 --> 25:47.672
Trust me...

25:47.922 --> 25:48.923
...you don't want to.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.887
So that's your Research Division?

25:54.137 --> 25:55.889
Things have changed.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.186
We're not an army anymore, Mr. Becket.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.646
We're the resistance.

26:04.439 --> 26:06.191
Welcome to the Shatterdome.

26:25.710 --> 26:30.423
War clock. We reset it after every
Kaiju attack. Keeps everyone focused.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.550
The frequency of attacks
is accelerating.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.135
How long till the next reset?

26:34.385 --> 26:36.387
A week, if we're lucky.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.185
My experts believe
there'll be a Kaiju attack...

26:39.390 --> 26:40.642
...even before that.

26:40.892 --> 26:42.060
This complex used to lodge...

26:42.310 --> 26:45.355
...30 Jaegers in five bays
just like this one.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.692
Now we only have four Jaegers left.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.403
I didn't know it was this bad.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.197
It is that bad.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.617
Crimson Typhoon, China.
One of the greatest.

26:57.867 --> 27:01.121
Assembled in Changzhou.
Full titanium core, no alloys.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.957
Fifty diesel engines
per muscle strand.

27:04.207 --> 27:05.458
Deadly, precise fighter.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.920
She's piloted by the Wei Tang
brothers. Triplets.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.338
Local lads.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.591
They've successfully defended
Hong Kong port seven times.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.552
They use the Thundercloud formation.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.887
Hell, yeah. Triple-arm technique.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.178
Very effective.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.105
That tank, last of the T-90s.
<i>Chemo Alpha.</i>

27:27.355 --> 27:31.067
First generation Mark 1. The heaviest
and oldest Jaeger in the service.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.404
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket,
it's a brutal war machine.

27:34.654 --> 27:35.530
And those two:

27:35.780 --> 27:37.490
Sasha and Aleksis Kaidanovsky.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.994
Yeah, I've heard of them.
Perimeter patrol, Siberian wall.

27:41.619 --> 27:46.166
On their watch it stayed
unbreached for six years. Six years.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.015
Herc! Chuck!

28:03.516 --> 28:06.144
Gentlemen, welcome to Hong Kong!

28:06.603 --> 28:07.770
Wait here.

28:08.605 --> 28:10.064
Max! Come here!

28:10.899 --> 28:12.339
- Remember me?
- Don't drool...

28:12.400 --> 28:14.402
...over Miss Mori. Sees a pretty girl...

28:14.652 --> 28:15.778
...and he gets all wound up.

28:16.029 --> 28:19.574
Raleigh, this is Hercules Hansen,
an old friend from the Mark 1 glory days.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.464
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.

28:21.534 --> 28:23.661
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.872
- It was a three Jaeger team drop.
- That's right. Manila.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.248
Sorry about your brother.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.209
Thank you, sir.

28:29.459 --> 28:32.253
Herc and his son Chuck'll be running
point using Striker Eureka.

28:32.795 --> 28:33.546
Fastest Jaeger...

28:33.796 --> 28:36.883
...in the world.
First and last of the Mark 5s.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.594
Australia decommissioned it
a day before the Sydney attack.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.930
- Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
- Yep.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.660
- Now it's running point for us.
- Wait, running point on what?

28:44.849 --> 28:47.185
You haven't told me
what I'm doing here yet.

28:48.186 --> 28:49.812
We're going for the Breach, Mr. Becket.

28:50.063 --> 28:54.359
We're gonna strap a 2400 pound
thermonuclear warhead to Striker's back.

28:54.609 --> 28:56.194
Detonate an equivalent of 1.2...

28:56.444 --> 28:58.071
...million tons of TNT.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.864
And you and two other Jaegers...

29:00.114 --> 29:02.492
- ...will be running defense for them.
- Thought we were the resistance.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.369
Where'd you get something that big?

29:04.911 --> 29:08.206
See the Russians back there?
They can get us anything.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.415
Herc, shall we?

29:09.666 --> 29:11.417
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you, sir.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.878
- I'll show you to your Jaeger now.
- Miss Mori...

29:15.505 --> 29:16.665
...will you give me a minute?

29:18.007 --> 29:19.008
Marshal!

29:20.301 --> 29:23.763
Sir, we've hit the Breach before.
It doesn't work. Nothing goes through.

29:24.013 --> 29:24.973
What's changed?

29:25.556 --> 29:28.810
I've got a plan. I need you ready.
That's all.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.520
Let's go, Herc!

29:31.604 --> 29:32.897
Max, come here!

29:35.233 --> 29:35.984
<i>Crew 17...</i>

29:36.234 --> 29:37.944
<i>please report to the fifth floor.</i>

29:39.570 --> 29:40.989
Zero minus two.

29:41.239 --> 29:44.242
XY minus two. R-E-Q...

29:44.492 --> 29:46.852
In the beginning, the Kaiju attacks
were spaced by 24 weeks.

29:47.620 --> 29:50.206
Then twelve, then six,
then every two weeks.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.459
The last one in Sydney was a week.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.336
In four days...

29:55.586 --> 29:57.005
...we could be seeing
a Kaiju every eight hours...

29:57.255 --> 29:59.048
...until they are coming
every four minutes.

29:59.299 --> 30:02.302
Marshal, we should witness a double
event within seven days.

30:03.219 --> 30:07.473
Mr. Gottlieb, I'm to drop a 2400 pound
thermonuclear bomb...

30:07.724 --> 30:08.604
...I need more than...

30:08.850 --> 30:10.435
- ...a prediction.
- Well, uh...

30:10.685 --> 30:11.811
...that's a problem, then...

30:12.061 --> 30:15.023
...because see, he actually can't give
you anything more than a prediction.

30:15.273 --> 30:18.109
No Kaiju entrails over my side
of the room. You know the rules.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.529
- Every bloody day. It's incessant.
- Gents! On point.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.906
Numbers do not lie.

30:24.157 --> 30:27.201
Politics and poetry, promises,
these are lies.

30:27.452 --> 30:30.330
Numbers are as close as we get
to the handwriting of God.

30:30.580 --> 30:33.041
- What?
- Would you give me a moment?

30:33.291 --> 30:34.667
There will be a double event.

30:35.084 --> 30:37.712
And then, shortly thereafter,
three. And then four...

30:37.962 --> 30:39.505
And then we're dead.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.758
- I get it.
- Alas.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.010
This is where the good news comes.

30:45.845 --> 30:49.349
Here is our universe...

30:50.141 --> 30:52.518
...and here is theirs.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.809
And this is what we call "The Throat,"
the passage between the Breach and us.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.398
We know that it's atomic in nature.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.234
I predict that the increased traffic...

31:00.485 --> 31:02.820
...will force the Breach to stabilize...

31:03.071 --> 31:04.405
...and remain open long enough...

31:04.655 --> 31:06.657
...to get the device through...

31:08.242 --> 31:09.827
...and collapse its structure.

31:10.578 --> 31:11.578
Yeah, and that's...

31:11.662 --> 31:13.664
...where I gotta chime in because,
really...

31:13.915 --> 31:16.755
...I wouldn't wanna go in there with
that limited amount of information.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.628
Newton, don't embarrass yourself.

31:18.878 --> 31:19.962
Just hear me out for a second.
Give me a second.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.130
Please.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.466
Why do we judge the Kaiju
on a category system?

31:23.716 --> 31:24.717
It's because each one...

31:24.967 --> 31:26.847
...is completely different
from the next, right?

31:26.969 --> 31:29.389
You see what I'm saying? Like, one looks
like a shark and one looks like a fish...

31:29.639 --> 31:31.516
Dr. Geiszler. Just get to the point.

31:31.766 --> 31:32.926
- Yes.
- The point is...

31:33.059 --> 31:35.019
...I don't think they're all
completely different after all.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.070
These are some samples
I collected, all right?

31:38.147 --> 31:40.316
Now, this one here
was harvested in Sydney.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.777
And this was harvested in Manila.

31:43.027 --> 31:43.986
Six years ago.

31:44.779 --> 31:47.782
They have the same exact DNA.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.076
They're clones.

31:50.326 --> 31:50.993
And this is...

31:51.244 --> 31:54.330
...the point where he goes
completely crazy.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.625
There's so much more
to the Kaiju than we understand.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.961
And we've really only scratched
the surface.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.547
This is a piece of a Kaiju's brain.

32:02.797 --> 32:05.925
Now, unfortunately, it's damaged.
It's a little bit weak.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.219
But it's still alive. Now, I think...

32:08.469 --> 32:09.554
...I can tap into it...

32:09.804 --> 32:12.364
...using the same technology
that allows the two Jaeger pilots...

32:12.598 --> 32:13.724
...to share a neural bridge.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.435
Now, think about that.

32:15.685 --> 32:17.562
I could tell you exactly...

32:17.812 --> 32:19.532
...how to get through
the Breach yourselves.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.983
You're suggesting that we initiate
a Drift with a Kaiju?

32:22.233 --> 32:25.862
No, no. No, no. Not like a whole Kaiju,
you know, just a tiny piece of its brain.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.030
The neural surge would be too much...

32:28.281 --> 32:29.365
- ...for the human brain.
- I agree.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.909
- I don't agree.
- Gottlieb...

32:32.160 --> 32:34.162
...I'd like your data on my desk ASAP.

32:34.412 --> 32:35.079
Sir.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.498
- No, but his is so...
- Thank you, Newt.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.834
Guys, now, this is the most amazing
thing...

32:40.084 --> 32:42.170
Newton, I know that
you're desperate to be right...

32:42.420 --> 32:44.839
...so you've not wasted your life
being a Kaiju groupie...

32:45.089 --> 32:46.299
...but it's not going to work.

32:46.549 --> 32:48.509
It is going to work, Hermann.
And I'll tell you...

32:48.759 --> 32:49.802
...something else.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.096
- Fortune favors the brave, dude.
- You heard them.

32:52.346 --> 32:55.016
They won't give you the equipment
and even if they did...

32:56.225 --> 32:57.226
...you'd kill yourself.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.562
Or I'd be a rock star.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.442
There she is.

33:08.738 --> 33:10.281
Oh, my God.

33:12.283 --> 33:13.284
Look at her.

33:15.119 --> 33:17.079
<i>Gipsy Danger.</i>

33:18.581 --> 33:21.000
God, it's so beautiful.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.460
She looks like new.

33:22.710 --> 33:23.590
Better than new.

33:23.794 --> 33:26.214
She has a double-core
nuclear reactor.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.091
She's one of a kind now.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.094
She always was.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.639
How do you like
your ride, Becket boy?

33:34.889 --> 33:38.809
Solid iron hull, no alloys.
Forty engine blocks per muscle strand.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.270
Hyper-torque driver for every limb
and a new fluid...

33:41.521 --> 33:42.772
...synapse system.

33:43.397 --> 33:44.482
Come here.

33:44.732 --> 33:47.318
Tendo. It's
good to see you, buddy.

33:47.944 --> 33:51.739
It's good to see you too, brother.
It's just like old times.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.868
So, what's your story?

33:56.118 --> 33:59.372
Restoring old Jaegers,
showing has-beens like me around.

33:59.997 --> 34:01.541
That can't be it.

34:01.999 --> 34:03.042
You a pilot?

34:03.292 --> 34:05.044
No. Not yet.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.088
But I wanna be one...

34:07.338 --> 34:08.422
...more than anything.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.675
What's your simulator score?

34:10.925 --> 34:13.928
Fifty-one drops, 51 kills.

34:14.178 --> 34:15.429
Wow, that's amazing.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.848
But you're not
one of the candidates tomorrow?

34:18.849 --> 34:20.226
I am not.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.228
The marshal has his reasons.

34:23.020 --> 34:24.522
Yeah, he always does, doesn't he?

34:24.772 --> 34:27.567
But with 51 kills,
I can't imagine what they could be.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.530
I hope you approve of my choices.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.199
I've studied your fighting techniques
and strategy.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.202
Even Alaska.

34:38.452 --> 34:39.911
And what do you think?

34:41.706 --> 34:45.293
I think you're unpredictable.

34:45.668 --> 34:49.505
You have a habit of deviating
from standard combat techniques.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.384
You take risks that endanger
yourself and your crew.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.344
I don't think you're the right man
for this mission.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.725
Wow.

35:01.392 --> 35:04.729
Thank you for your honesty.
You might be right.

35:05.104 --> 35:09.442
But one day, when you're a pilot,
you're gonna see that in combat...

35:10.192 --> 35:11.986
...you make decisions.

35:15.656 --> 35:17.700
And you have to live
with the consequences.

35:19.952 --> 35:22.038
That's what I'm trying to do.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.738
The candidates are ready.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.990
We will commence
the trials immediately, sir.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.784
- Good.
- But there is one thing.

36:00.034 --> 36:02.620
Mako, we have talked about this.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.247
We will not be talking about it again.

36:06.248 --> 36:08.000
You promised me.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.421
Mako.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.427
Vengeance is like an open wound.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.138
You cannot take that level of emotion
into the Drift.

36:21.389 --> 36:22.349
For my family, I need...

36:36.112 --> 36:37.405
Raleigh.

36:38.072 --> 36:39.407
Come sit with us.

36:39.657 --> 36:41.117
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.911
Ah, come on,
there's plenty of room at our table.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.122
I haven't seen bread in a while.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.707
Hong Kong.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.834
Beauty of an open port, no rationing.

36:50.084 --> 36:54.046
We've got potatoes, peas,
sweet beans, decent meat loaf.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.464
Pass the potatoes.

36:56.298 --> 36:57.338
Raleigh, this is my son...

36:57.550 --> 36:59.301
...Chuck. He's my copilot now.

36:59.552 --> 37:00.803
He's more my copilot.

37:01.053 --> 37:02.513
Right, Dad?

37:02.763 --> 37:04.432
So you're the guy, eh?

37:04.682 --> 37:06.267
You're the guy who's gonna run defense
for me...

37:06.517 --> 37:09.103
- ...in that old rust bucket of yours?
- That's the plan.

37:09.353 --> 37:10.312
Good.

37:10.563 --> 37:12.815
So when was the last time
you jockeyed, Ray?

37:14.358 --> 37:16.152
About five years ago.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.780
What have you been doing for five years?
Something pretty important, I reckon.

37:20.823 --> 37:21.949
I was in construction.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.326
Oh, wow, that's great.

37:24.577 --> 37:26.203
I mean, that's really useful.

37:26.454 --> 37:28.894
We get into a fight, you can build
our way out of it, eh, Ray?

37:30.708 --> 37:32.001
It's Raleigh.

37:32.543 --> 37:33.711
Whatever.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.589
Look, you're Pentecost's bright idea.

37:36.839 --> 37:38.507
And my old man, he seems to like you.

37:38.758 --> 37:42.094
But it's guys like you who brought
down the Jaeger program. To me...

37:42.344 --> 37:43.304
...you're dead weight.

37:43.554 --> 37:44.597
You slow me down...

37:44.847 --> 37:46.849
...I'm gonna drop you
like a sack of Kaiju shit.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.187
I'll see you around, Raleigh.
Come on, Max.

37:53.981 --> 37:56.525
You can blame me for that one.
I've raised him on my own.

37:56.776 --> 37:59.445
He's a smart kid, but I never knew
whether to give him a hug...

37:59.695 --> 38:01.197
...or a kick in the ass.

38:03.282 --> 38:04.909
With respect, sir...

38:05.993 --> 38:08.078
...I'm pretty sure which one he needs.

38:16.629 --> 38:17.963
Four points to 0.

38:29.058 --> 38:30.226
Four points to 1.

38:45.616 --> 38:46.325
Four points...

38:46.575 --> 38:47.409
...to 2.

38:48.202 --> 38:49.245
Okay, what?

38:50.162 --> 38:50.963
You don't like them?

38:51.205 --> 38:52.039
I thought you selected them...

38:52.289 --> 38:53.207
...personally.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.333
Excuse me?

38:54.583 --> 38:58.462
Every time a match ends
you make this little gesture...

38:58.754 --> 39:00.514
...like you're critical
of their performance.

39:00.631 --> 39:03.384
It's not their performance,
it's yours. Your gambit.

39:03.634 --> 39:05.135
You could have taken...

39:05.386 --> 39:06.720
...all of them two moves earlier.

39:08.222 --> 39:08.931
You think so?

39:09.181 --> 39:10.140
I know so.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.184
Can we change this up?

39:12.643 --> 39:13.444
How about we give...

39:13.686 --> 39:14.728
...her a shot.

39:16.355 --> 39:19.817
No. We stick to
the cadet list we have, ranger.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.944
Only candidates with Drift
compatibility...

39:22.194 --> 39:23.404
Which I have, marshal.

39:23.654 --> 39:25.239
Mako, this is not only
about a neural connection.

39:25.489 --> 39:27.449
It's also about a physical compatibility.

39:27.700 --> 39:28.781
What's the matter, marshal?

39:29.743 --> 39:32.024
Don't think your brightest
can cut it in the ring with me?

39:34.999 --> 39:36.208
Go.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.716
Four strikes marks a win.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.473
Remember, it's about compatibility.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.350
It's a dialogue, not a fight.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.081
But I'm not gonna dial down my moves.

39:56.729 --> 39:57.563
Okay.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.482
Then neither will I.

40:17.917 --> 40:18.751
One-zero.

40:20.961 --> 40:21.795
One-one.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.302
Two-one. Concentrate.

40:36.810 --> 40:37.728
Two-two.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.021
Better watch it.

40:49.365 --> 40:50.491
Oh.

40:50.991 --> 40:52.368
Three-two.

41:18.185 --> 41:18.811
Enough.

41:21.397 --> 41:22.557
I've seen what I need to see.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.400
Me too.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.402
She's my copilot.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.570
That's not going to work.

41:29.279 --> 41:29.947
Why not?

41:30.197 --> 41:31.740
Because I said so, Mr. Becket.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.617
I made my decision. Report to...

41:33.867 --> 41:36.996
...the Shatterdome in two hours
and find out who your copilot will be.

41:52.428 --> 41:53.679
Mako.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.098
What was all that about?

41:57.099 --> 41:57.766
I mean...

41:58.017 --> 41:59.685
...I'm not crazy. You felt it, right?

42:00.519 --> 42:01.687
We are Drift compatible.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.564
Thank you for standing up for me.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.568
But there is nothing to talk about.

42:12.406 --> 42:13.866
That's my room.

42:15.784 --> 42:16.994
Excuse me.

42:17.703 --> 42:20.103
I mean, come on.
I thought you wanted to be a pilot.

42:20.372 --> 42:21.040
Mako...

42:21.290 --> 42:23.125
...this is worth fighting for.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.754
We don't have to just obey him.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.215
It's not obedience, Mr. Becket.

42:34.011 --> 42:35.512
It's respect.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.265
Would you at least tell me...

42:38.515 --> 42:39.767
...what his problem is?

43:01.205 --> 43:02.456
<i>In the wake...</i>

43:02.706 --> 43:05.667
<i>...of the Sydney incident
which showed the ineffective nature...</i>

43:05.918 --> 43:08.962
<i>...of the Wall of Life program,
many are questioning...</i>

43:09.213 --> 43:11.093
<i>...the government's motives
and wondering why...</i>

43:11.298 --> 43:13.842
<i>...the Jaeger program
has been discontinued.</i>

43:14.093 --> 43:16.637
<i>Riots have erupted
along the coastlines of several...</i>

43:16.887 --> 43:17.805
<i>...Pan Pacific...</i>

43:18.055 --> 43:18.764
<i>...cities.</i>

43:20.015 --> 43:24.478
<i>We have now relocated
millions of civilians and supplies...</i>

43:24.728 --> 43:27.106
<i>...300 miles inland
to the safe zones.</i>

43:27.356 --> 43:31.110
<i>Safe zones? For the rich and powerful?
What about the rest of us?</i>

43:31.360 --> 43:32.600
<i>Yeah, answer the question.</i>

43:32.611 --> 43:35.852
<i>I believe the Wall of Life
is still our best option at this time.</i>

43:36.073 --> 43:38.193
<i>And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter. Thank you.</i>

43:43.038 --> 43:43.839
Kaiju/Human...

43:43.956 --> 43:45.916
...Drift experiment, take one.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.377
The, uh...

43:48.627 --> 43:51.338
The brain segment is the frontal lobe.

43:51.713 --> 43:54.174
Um, chances are...

43:54.424 --> 43:56.718
...the segment's far too damaged
to Drift with.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.304
Unscientific aside:

43:59.555 --> 44:02.015
Hermann,
if you're listening to this...

44:02.266 --> 44:05.811
...well, I'm either alive and
I've proven what I've just done works...

44:06.145 --> 44:07.646
...in which case, ha, ha, I won...

44:07.896 --> 44:10.456
...or I'm dead and I'd like you to know
that it's all your fault.

44:10.691 --> 44:12.109
It really is. You know,
you drove me to this.

44:12.359 --> 44:13.318
In which case...

44:13.569 --> 44:15.028
...ha, I also won.

44:16.029 --> 44:17.281
Sort of.

44:18.323 --> 44:20.242
I'm going in in three...

44:21.201 --> 44:22.578
...two...

44:23.412 --> 44:24.246
...one.

44:49.271 --> 44:50.981
Newton. Newton!

44:51.440 --> 44:52.900
What have you done?

45:00.324 --> 45:03.744
<i>Gipsy Danger neural test commencing...</i>

45:03.994 --> 45:04.995
<i>...in 20 minutes.</i>

45:07.289 --> 45:08.081
Gipsy Danger...

45:08.332 --> 45:10.792
<i>...neural test commencing...</i>

45:11.043 --> 45:12.586
<i>...in 20 minutes.</i>

45:14.379 --> 45:16.632
<i>Gipsy Danger neural test...</i>

45:26.391 --> 45:28.101
May I come in, Mako?

45:34.233 --> 45:35.609
A long time ago...

45:35.859 --> 45:37.361
...I made you a promise.

45:47.829 --> 45:50.666
These transmitters are non-operative.
I need them replaced.

45:57.172 --> 45:58.733
<i>Setting harness for test mode.</i>

45:58.924 --> 46:00.342
Waiting for second pilot.

46:09.476 --> 46:10.936
<i>Two pilots on board.</i>

46:11.186 --> 46:15.357
I'm gonna take this side if you don't
mind. My left arm's kind of shot.

46:15.607 --> 46:16.650
Sure.

46:19.528 --> 46:21.363
Are you gonna say anything?

46:22.572 --> 46:24.950
No point. In five minutes
you're gonna be...

46:25.200 --> 46:26.576
...inside my head.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.328
You look good.

46:31.707 --> 46:34.793
<i>Pilots on board and ready to connect.</i>

46:35.043 --> 46:37.403
- Prepare for neural handshake.
- Initiating...

46:37.629 --> 46:38.588
...neural handshake.

46:45.971 --> 46:48.307
Okay. We're not in
the simulator now, Mako.

46:48.557 --> 46:51.184
Remember, don't chase the rabbit.

46:51.435 --> 46:53.276
Random Access Brain Impulse
Triggers. Memories.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.355
Just let them flow, don't latch on.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.524
Tune them out. Stay in the Drift.

46:57.774 --> 46:58.775
The Drift is silence.

46:59.651 --> 47:03.280
<i>Neural interface Drift initiated.</i>

47:03.530 --> 47:05.073
<i>Raleigh!</i>

47:14.666 --> 47:16.251
<i>Mama!</i>

47:17.002 --> 47:20.297
<i>Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!</i>

47:25.093 --> 47:27.387
<i>Right hemisphere calibrated.</i>

47:27.637 --> 47:30.474
<i>Left hemisphere calibrated.</i>

47:32.351 --> 47:34.227
<i>Ready to activate...</i>

47:34.478 --> 47:35.687
<i>...the Jaeger.</i>

47:37.022 --> 47:39.941
Okay, <i>Gipsy.</i> Lining up nicely.

47:40.484 --> 47:41.818
Better get ready.

47:42.069 --> 47:43.820
<i>Pilot to Jaeger connection complete.</i>

47:44.071 --> 47:45.947
Marshal! Marshal!

47:46.198 --> 47:47.240
I need to talk to you.

47:47.699 --> 47:48.658
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.

47:48.909 --> 47:51.411
I'm sure you can appreciate
how important this moment is to me.

47:51.661 --> 47:55.040
Newton created a neural bridge from
garbage and Drifted with a Kaiju.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.212
I found him prone...

48:00.462 --> 48:03.048
...and he's sort of dazed.

48:03.298 --> 48:06.301
I don't exactly know what to do.

48:09.846 --> 48:11.056
I told you it would work.

48:11.390 --> 48:13.892
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?

48:14.393 --> 48:17.729
It was only a fragment of a brain, so
really all I was able to get was, like...

48:17.979 --> 48:19.773
...a series of, uh, images...

48:20.023 --> 48:21.066
...or impressions.

48:21.316 --> 48:24.027
Like when you blink your eyes over and
over and over again all you really see...

48:24.277 --> 48:25.904
...are, like, frames. It was emotion.

48:26.154 --> 48:27.072
Newton, Newton.

48:27.322 --> 48:30.325
Okay, Newton. Newton, look at me.

48:31.535 --> 48:35.705
Now I want you to take your time
and be very specific.

48:36.331 --> 48:38.750
Okay. Okay.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.121
Well, I don't feel like they're just
following some sort of animalistic urge...

48:42.254 --> 48:43.855
...you know, just hunting and gathering.

48:43.964 --> 48:45.799
And I think they're attacking us
under orders.

48:46.049 --> 48:47.134
That's impossible.

48:47.384 --> 48:48.945
- Is that impossible?
- It's impossible.

48:49.177 --> 48:49.886
Why don't you...

48:50.137 --> 48:50.720
...Drift with a Kaiju?

48:50.971 --> 48:52.431
You! Shut up!

48:54.057 --> 48:56.518
You, keep talking.

48:59.521 --> 49:03.817
These beings, these masters,
they're colonists.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.944
They overtake worlds.
They just consume them...

49:06.194 --> 49:07.863
...and then they move on to the next.

49:08.321 --> 49:11.241
And they've been here before
in sort of a trial run.

49:12.284 --> 49:13.124
It was the dinosaurs.

49:13.368 --> 49:15.048
But the atmosphere
wasn't conducive, right?

49:15.287 --> 49:17.164
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.

49:17.414 --> 49:20.250
And now with ozone depletion,
and carbon monoxide, polluted waters...

49:20.500 --> 49:22.752
...well, we've practically
terraformed it for them.

49:23.003 --> 49:25.255
Because now they're coming back,
and it's perfect.

49:25.505 --> 49:27.306
See, the first wave,
that was just the hounds.

49:27.549 --> 49:29.069
Categories 1 through 4,
it was nothing.

49:29.301 --> 49:31.011
Their sole purpose was to aim
for the populated areas...

49:31.261 --> 49:32.262
...and to take out the vermin: Us!

49:32.512 --> 49:35.056
The second wave,
that is the exterminators.

49:35.307 --> 49:37.350
And they will finish the job. And then...

49:37.601 --> 49:38.560
...the new tenants...

49:38.810 --> 49:39.936
...will take possession.

49:41.688 --> 49:44.929
See, the reason that I found the identical
DNA in the two separate Kaiju organs...

49:45.150 --> 49:46.818
...is because they are grown!

49:47.068 --> 49:48.429
Newton, I need you to do it again.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.780
I need more information.

49:51.281 --> 49:53.241
I can't do it again.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.952
I mean, not unless you have
a fresh Kaiju brain...

49:56.203 --> 49:57.245
...lying around.

50:00.499 --> 50:01.500
Do you?

50:09.341 --> 50:10.258
Pretty impressive.

50:10.509 --> 50:12.052
Yeah, he remembers how to turn it on.

50:12.302 --> 50:13.887
Oi, show some respect.

50:14.137 --> 50:16.737
When his brother died, he got
the Jaeger back to shore on his own.

50:16.973 --> 50:19.134
I've known one other pilot
that's been able to do that.

50:20.727 --> 50:23.230
Now, there are certain individuals
whose business is the preservation...

50:23.480 --> 50:25.315
...and exploitation of Kaiju remains.

50:25.565 --> 50:27.776
Uh, yeah, right, um,
black market dealers, right?

50:28.026 --> 50:29.945
Yep. They're in and out
in a matter of hours.

50:30.195 --> 50:32.115
They neutralize the acidic factor
of the blood...

50:32.364 --> 50:33.907
...and they harvest what they need.

50:34.157 --> 50:36.952
Now, this guy, this is Hannibal Chau.

50:37.452 --> 50:38.828
He runs the Kaiju black market...

50:39.079 --> 50:40.539
...here in Asia.
When our funding ran out...

50:40.789 --> 50:42.249
...we turned to him for help
and in return...

50:42.499 --> 50:44.751
...I gave him exclusive rights
to all Kaiju remains in the region.

50:45.001 --> 50:45.961
You did that?

50:46.211 --> 50:47.796
Last days of war, gentlemen.

50:48.296 --> 50:49.464
Go to the corner of Fong...

50:49.714 --> 50:51.174
...and Tull. Show them that card.

50:51.424 --> 50:52.634
Look for that symbol.

50:52.884 --> 50:55.470
And a word to the wise, do not trust him.

51:00.141 --> 51:01.309
<i>Calibration...</i>

51:01.560 --> 51:03.019
<i>...complete.</i>

51:03.603 --> 51:05.522
<i>The hull! It
went through the hull!</i>

51:05.772 --> 51:07.412
Raleigh, listen to me! You need...

51:10.026 --> 51:10.735
<i>Pilot...</i>

51:10.986 --> 51:11.787
<i>...out of alignment.</i>

51:12.028 --> 51:14.573
- Both out of alignment.
- Both of them?

51:15.574 --> 51:16.375
Both of them.

51:16.491 --> 51:18.493
<i>Gipsy, Gipsy!</i> You're out of alignment!

51:18.743 --> 51:20.954
<i>- You are both out of alignment.</i>
- I'm okay. Just let me control it.

51:21.204 --> 51:24.457
<i>- Out of alignment. Code red.</i>
<i>- You're stabilizing. But Mako is way out.</i>

51:24.708 --> 51:26.459
<i>She's starting to chase the rabbit!</i>

51:26.710 --> 51:28.962
Mako, don't get stuck in a memory.

51:29.212 --> 51:31.423
Stay with me. Stay in the now.

51:31.673 --> 51:33.925
Don't engage in a memory.

51:34.259 --> 51:35.719
Mako.

51:35.969 --> 51:38.638
Mako! Listen to me.

51:38.888 --> 51:40.390
Mako?

52:01.453 --> 52:02.704
<i>Mama!</i>

52:04.456 --> 52:05.332
<i>Mama!</i>

53:00.345 --> 53:01.596
Mako.

53:02.263 --> 53:04.349
This is just a memory.

53:04.599 --> 53:06.226
None of this is real.

53:30.250 --> 53:32.419
<i>Weapons system engaged.</i>

53:32.836 --> 53:35.171
<i>Plasma cannon powering up.</i>

53:35.922 --> 53:36.673
Oh, no.

53:49.894 --> 53:50.812
Weapon system engaged!

53:51.062 --> 53:51.980
Go to fail-safe!

53:52.230 --> 53:54.911
Fail-safe not responding. There's
a problem with the neural blocker!

53:55.400 --> 53:56.680
Her connection's way too strong!

53:58.027 --> 53:59.279
<i>- Fully charged.</i>
- Mako!

54:00.113 --> 54:04.409
Mako, listen to me. This is just
a memory. None of it is real.

54:22.594 --> 54:24.721
The power line! The power line!

54:24.971 --> 54:25.931
Get the main power line!

54:46.826 --> 54:48.411
Take them offline!

54:48.661 --> 54:49.412
Take them offline!

54:51.456 --> 54:52.416
I just did.

55:01.299 --> 55:03.468
<i>Weapon system disengaged.</i>

55:05.762 --> 55:07.013
Mako!

55:11.893 --> 55:13.228
<i>Neural bridge exercise...</i>

55:13.978 --> 55:14.979
<i>...in valid.</i>

55:18.274 --> 55:20.819
It's okay. It's okay.

55:21.069 --> 55:23.947
<i>Drift sequence terminated.</i>

55:24.197 --> 55:24.878
<i>Would you like...</i>

55:25.824 --> 55:27.408
<i>...to try again?</i>

55:47.345 --> 55:48.012
Hmm...

55:58.147 --> 55:59.440
Hello.

56:16.749 --> 56:17.792
Pss, pss.

56:18.626 --> 56:20.962
You looking for some Kaiju...

56:21.212 --> 56:23.298
- ...bone powder?
- Some...? Some bone...?

56:24.090 --> 56:25.758
Some bone powder?

56:26.342 --> 56:28.344
Uh, no, why would I want that?

56:28.595 --> 56:29.721
Male potency.

56:31.055 --> 56:31.806
I take it myself.

56:32.473 --> 56:34.809
I see. Uh, no, thank you.

56:35.059 --> 56:35.894
I'm looking...

56:36.144 --> 56:37.270
...for Hannibal Chau.

56:39.606 --> 56:40.732
Come.

56:43.610 --> 56:45.612
You want Chau, huh?

56:46.654 --> 56:48.072
Good luck.

56:55.997 --> 57:00.043
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
this place is heaven!

57:00.293 --> 57:04.047
That's a lymph gland from a Category 2!
And what are you working on here?

57:04.297 --> 57:06.799
Is this a cuticle? In mint condition?

57:07.842 --> 57:11.346
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?
I've never seen them alive before!

57:11.596 --> 57:14.015
They usually die
as soon as the Kaiju falls!

57:14.265 --> 57:17.705
- I thought you couldn't keep them alive!
- You can if you soak them in ammonia.

57:22.857 --> 57:23.900
What do you want?

57:24.150 --> 57:25.870
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.
I was told...

57:26.110 --> 57:27.195
...he was here.

57:29.822 --> 57:31.074
Who wants to know?

57:32.075 --> 57:33.076
I really can't say.

57:39.207 --> 57:40.247
Stacker Pentecost sent me!

57:43.878 --> 57:46.422
Oh, that's great. That's real great.

57:46.673 --> 57:48.758
So I take it you're Hannibal Chau, right?

57:49.008 --> 57:51.094
You like the name? I took it...

57:51.344 --> 57:53.064
...from my favorite historical character...

57:53.096 --> 57:55.377
...and my second-favorite
Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn.

57:55.765 --> 57:57.100
Now tell me what you want...

57:57.350 --> 58:00.019
...before I gut you like a pig
and feed you to the skin louse.

58:00.269 --> 58:01.309
<i>She can't control...</i>

58:01.312 --> 58:04.312
- ...her Drift, and he went out of phase first!
- We all know what happened.

58:04.524 --> 58:08.861
We can't afford mistakes. The Kaiju
keep evolving, they keep kicking our asses!

58:09.112 --> 58:11.114
He's a has-been, she's a rookie.

58:11.364 --> 58:14.450
I don't want them protecting
my bomb run, sir.

58:16.703 --> 58:19.497
You need to watch
your tone, Mr. Hansen.

58:19.872 --> 58:21.833
Hey, stay there.

58:22.583 --> 58:24.085
Give me a moment.

58:27.422 --> 58:29.799
You two are a goddamn disgrace.

58:30.341 --> 58:33.428
You're gonna get us all killed,
and here's the thing, Raleigh:

58:33.970 --> 58:35.888
I want to come back
from this mission...

58:36.139 --> 58:38.307
...because I quite like my life.

58:39.851 --> 58:42.645
So why don't you just do us all
a favor and disappear?

58:42.895 --> 58:44.295
It's the only thing you're good at.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.481
Stop! Now!

58:46.065 --> 58:47.608
Yeah, that's right.

58:48.026 --> 58:49.694
You just hold back
your little girlfriend.

58:50.820 --> 58:52.864
One of you bitches needs a leash.

58:59.245 --> 59:01.080
Apologize to her.

59:01.539 --> 59:02.290
Screw you.

59:19.766 --> 59:23.227
I said apologize to her.

59:29.233 --> 59:30.276
Hey, hey! Enough!

59:31.277 --> 59:32.028
What's going on?

59:32.820 --> 59:34.739
On your feet, both of you!

59:39.577 --> 59:40.411
Becket...

59:40.661 --> 59:42.701
- ...Mori, into my office.
- No, we aren't finished!

59:42.747 --> 59:43.873
This is over!

59:44.123 --> 59:46.523
You're a ranger, for chrissake.
Why don't you start acting...

59:46.751 --> 59:47.585
...like one?

59:53.049 --> 59:54.717
<i>I went out of phase first.</i>

59:54.967 --> 59:57.095
- It was my mistake.
- No.

59:58.638 --> 01:00:01.057
It was my mistake.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.807
I should have never let you two
in the same machine.

01:00:04.894 --> 01:00:06.104
So, what...

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:07.480
...you're grounding us?

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.065
Not you.

01:00:16.906 --> 01:00:19.408
Permission to be dismissed, sir.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:25.998
Permission granted, Miss Mori.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:31.712
Mako.

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:35.842
Sir, what are you doing?

01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:38.678
She is the strongest candidate by far.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.058
What other options do we have?
Huh? Tell me!

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:47.478
Do not let my calm demeanor fool you...

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:48.980
...ranger!

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.149
Now is not a good moment...

01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:53.025
...for your insubordination!

01:00:54.569 --> 01:00:57.572
Mako is too inexperienced to rein in
her memories during combat.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.200
That's not why...

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.702
...you grounded her.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:06.664
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.

01:01:07.165 --> 01:01:09.208
I don't care what you think you saw.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:05.700
I know what she means to you. I saw it!

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.201
Hey! Hey!

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.203
This conversation is over.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:12.832
Marshal. Marshal,
can we just talk about this...

01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:14.166
...for one second?

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:20.172
You rescued her.

01:03:21.257 --> 01:03:22.842
You raised her.

01:03:23.092 --> 01:03:25.052
You're not protecting her now.

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:26.929
You are holding her back.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:28.472
One:

01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:30.808
Don't you ever touch me again.

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.101
Two:

01:03:32.435 --> 01:03:34.687
Don't you ever touch me again.

01:03:37.106 --> 01:03:41.027
Now, you have no idea who the hell
I am or where I've come from...

01:03:41.277 --> 01:03:43.696
...and I'm not about to tell you
my whole life story.

01:03:44.113 --> 01:03:46.574
All I need to be to you
and everybody on this dome...

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.868
...is a fixed point.

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:51.120
The last man standing.

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:54.707
I do not need your sympathy
or your admiration.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:58.961
All I need is your compliance
and your fighting skills.

01:04:00.129 --> 01:04:01.380
And if I can't get that...

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:05.301
...then you can go back to the wall
that I found you crawling on.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:07.845
Do I make myself clear?

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:15.561
Yes, sir.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:19.523
Good.

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.178
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:51.680
<i>I should've warned you.</i>

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:54.558
First Drifts are rough.

01:04:54.809 --> 01:04:56.689
But you weren't just tapping
into my memories...

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.495
...you were tapping into my brother's...

01:04:58.729 --> 01:04:59.647
...too.

01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:04.777
When Yancy was taken,
we were still connected.

01:05:07.113 --> 01:05:09.865
I felt his fear, his pain,
his helplessness...

01:05:10.116 --> 01:05:11.200
...and then...

01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:14.036
...he was gone.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:16.997
I felt it. I know.

01:05:20.292 --> 01:05:22.795
You know, you live in someone else's
head for so long...

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:25.131
...the hardest part to deal with
is the silence.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:28.884
To let someone else in,
to really connect...

01:05:29.385 --> 01:05:31.345
...you have to trust them.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.683
And today the Drift was strong.

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:44.567
Her heart.

01:05:45.276 --> 01:05:47.361
When's the last time you saw it?

01:05:48.237 --> 01:05:49.488
Not in a long time.

01:05:56.162 --> 01:05:58.289
<i>Movement in the Breach.</i>

01:05:58.539 --> 01:05:59.373
<i>Double event.</i>

01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:04.211
<i>Two signatures.</i>

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:08.382
<i>Dilation indicator, Category 4.</i>

01:06:18.684 --> 01:06:20.084
- Excuse me.
- Breach was exposed...

01:06:20.186 --> 01:06:20.867
...at 2300 hours.

01:06:21.896 --> 01:06:22.897
We have two signatures...

01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:23.948
...both Category 4s.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:25.983
Code names: Otachi and Leatherback.

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.794
They'll reach Hong Kong
within the hour.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:29.862
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.

01:06:30.112 --> 01:06:32.573
I want every single civilian
in a refuge right now.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:33.543
<i>Crimson Typhoon...</i>

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:34.700
<i>Chemo Alpha...</i>

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.577
...I want you to frontline the harbor.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.037
Stay on the miracle mile.

01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:41.207
Striker, I want you to stay back,
look after the coastline.

01:06:41.457 --> 01:06:45.044
We cannot afford to lose you,
so only engage as a final option.

01:06:45.294 --> 01:06:46.253
Yes, sir!

01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:47.254
You two.

01:06:47.922 --> 01:06:49.298
You stay put.

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:51.383
Let's go!

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.026
<i>Loccent, Striker's got the ball...</i>

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:10.486
...and we're on the roll.

01:07:11.904 --> 01:07:13.197
Loccent...

01:07:13.656 --> 01:07:14.698
...near positions...

01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:16.534
...and awaiting your orders.

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:20.204
<i>Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.</i>

01:07:20.454 --> 01:07:21.622
<i>Guys, keep your eyes open.</i>

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:24.959
<i>These Category 4s are the biggest
we've ever seen, both in size and weight.</i>

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:29.380
<i>Cherno Alpha
reaching target zone.</i>

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.173
Disengaging transport.

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.696
<i>Cherno Alpha in position. Miracle mile.</i>

01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.907
<i>Chemo Alpha</i> holding the coastline.

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.492
<i>Beacon is on.</i>

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:08.586
<i>Look at them.</i>

01:08:08.836 --> 01:08:10.754
They believe the Kaiju
were sent from heaven.

01:08:11.005 --> 01:08:14.049
That the gods are expressing their
displeasure with our behavior.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.718
The silly bastards.

01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:17.344
And what do you believe?

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:18.554
Well...

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:22.683
...I believe that Kaiju bone powder
is 500 bucks a pound.

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:24.602
- What do you want?
- I need to access...

01:08:24.852 --> 01:08:27.729
...a Kaiju brain. Completely intact.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.859
No, no. The skull plate is so dense
that by the time you drill into it...

01:08:31.066 --> 01:08:32.443
The brain's rotted away.
But I'm talking...

01:08:32.693 --> 01:08:33.944
...about the secondary brain.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:36.529
Now we both know
that the Kaiju are so large...

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.981
...they need two brains to move
around, like a dinosaur.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.439
I want to get my hands on that.

01:08:41.035 --> 01:08:44.912
Mm. What the hell do you want
a secondary brain for, anyway?

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:47.416
I mean, every part of the Kaiju sells.

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:49.335
Cartilage, spleen, liver.

01:08:49.585 --> 01:08:50.669
Even the crap!

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:53.631
One cubic meter of crap
has enough phosphorous in it...

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:55.215
...to fertilize a whole field!

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:56.800
But the brain...

01:08:57.343 --> 01:08:58.969
Too much ammonia.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.305
So, what's the deal, little fella?

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.182
Well, that's classified.

01:09:03.432 --> 01:09:05.975
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.270
- Mm.
- But it is pretty cool.

01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:11.482
Sol might tell you.

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:13.901
I'm gonna tell you.

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:16.194
I figured out how to Drift
with a Kaiju.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.656
Are you funning me, son?

01:09:18.906 --> 01:09:20.741
It's fascinating how their minds work.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:22.158
Every single Kaiju...

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.618
...his mind's connected.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:24.870
The species has, like...

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.747
Like a hive mind.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.502
Holy jeez.

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:33.774
You've gone and done it, haven't you?

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.465
I did it a little bit, yeah.

01:09:39.843 --> 01:09:41.804
You goddamn moron.

01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:17.148
Loccent! <i>Typhoon...</i>

01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:18.525
...and <i>Alpha</i> are in trouble.

01:11:18.776 --> 01:11:19.443
<i>We're moving in!</i>

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:21.945
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.

01:11:22.196 --> 01:11:23.614
<i>We need you to carry that bomb.</i>

01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:24.907
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.603
Jesus, we can't just sit here...

01:11:36.627 --> 01:11:37.867
...and watch them die. Come on!

01:11:38.045 --> 01:11:38.712
Screw this.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:39.755
Loccent, we're moving in...

01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:41.381
<i>...now!</i>

01:12:12.663 --> 01:12:15.824
<i>Chemo Alpha,</i>
we've been hit with some type of acid!

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:17.436
- Come on!
<i>- Hull has been compromised.</i>

01:12:18.085 --> 01:12:19.503
<i>We need backup immediately!</i>

01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:20.793
Just hold on, <i>Chemo!</i>

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.256
<i>We're on our way!</i>

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:57.374
Our power move! Yeah!

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.306
We just lost <i>Chemo</i>, sir.

01:13:49.134 --> 01:13:50.010
Engaging...

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:50.928
...air missiles!

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:19.862
What's going on? What happened?

01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:22.459
The blast. It jumbled all the Jaegers'
electrical circuits.

01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:24.044
What the hell was that?

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.415
I've never seen that before.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:26.747
- Loccent!
<i>- They're adapting.</i>

01:14:26.922 --> 01:14:29.132
This isn't a defense mechanism,
it's a weapon!

01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:30.300
Get me <i>Striker.</i>

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.270
Nothing, sir. The Mark 5's digital's fried.

01:14:32.511 --> 01:14:35.931
It'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary.
All the Jaegers, they're digital!

01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:37.891
Not all of them, marshal.

01:14:38.433 --> 01:14:40.394
<i>Gipsy's</i> analog. Nuclear.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:57.828
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out. This way.

01:14:58.078 --> 01:14:59.955
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
What's going on?

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:02.685
There are two goddamn Kaiju
headed straight for Hong Kong City.

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:03.876
No, that's not possible.

01:15:04.001 --> 01:15:04.918
There's never been two before.

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:09.548
Well, maybe that's because nobody ever
Drifted with one before, eh? Genius!

01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:12.676
When Jaeger pilots Drift,
it's a two-way street.

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:15.012
A bridge, right?
It sets up a connection.

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:16.763
Both ways!

01:15:17.764 --> 01:15:19.558
"A hive mentality," you said!

01:15:19.808 --> 01:15:22.227
Maybe those Kaiju are trying to find you.

01:15:22.644 --> 01:15:24.062
What're we gonna do?

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:27.024
I'm gonna wait out this shitstorm
in my own private Kaiju bunker.

01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:29.901
But you are going to a public refuge.

01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:31.153
I tried it once.

01:15:32.446 --> 01:15:33.780
Once.

01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:35.282
Now get the hell out of here.

01:16:28.877 --> 01:16:30.962
Move! Move! I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!

01:16:32.839 --> 01:16:34.174
Okay, hold on. Let me in.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:37.552
Okay, I'm a doctor. Okay, let me in,
I'm a doctor.

01:17:02.244 --> 01:17:04.045
- There's no emergency power.
- We gotta bail.

01:17:04.204 --> 01:17:06.248
- I'm gonna try something else.
- No!

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:07.624
<i>Don't disengage!</i>

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:11.920
My arm!

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.570
Come on! Get on your feet, old man!

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:16.049
Don't call me that!

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.256
<i>He's right outside.
We gotta get out of here now!</i>

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:26.059
<i>We're not going anywhere!</i>

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:29.070
Now you and I are the only thing
standing between that ugly bastard...

01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:30.671
...and a city of 10 million people.

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:32.816
Now we have a choice here.
We either sit and wait...

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:36.862
...or we take these flare guns
and do something really stupid.

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:52.912
- How's your arm?
- Ah, just give me the gun.

01:17:54.212 --> 01:17:54.921
Hey, you!

01:18:05.891 --> 01:18:07.350
I think we just pissed it off!

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:32.542
All right, Mako.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.586
Get ready, this is for real!

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.961
- Yeah!
- Come on, <i>Gipsy!</i>

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:49.851
Kick his ass!

01:19:37.607 --> 01:19:38.275
Come on!

01:19:38.525 --> 01:19:39.567
Let's do this! Together!

01:20:00.422 --> 01:20:01.381
<i>Elbow rocket!</i>

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:02.424
<i>Elbow rocket...</i>

01:20:02.674 --> 01:20:03.383
<i>...engaged.</i>

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:05.093
<i>Now!</i>

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:47.844
Hang on, Mako!

01:21:05.945 --> 01:21:07.822
<i>Plasma cannon, now!</i>

01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:09.866
<i>Plasma cannon engaged.</i>

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:16.081
Empty the clip!

01:21:16.498 --> 01:21:18.124
<i>Empty the clip!</i>

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:53.952
<i>Wait.</i>

01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:57.163
I think this guy's dead.

01:21:57.414 --> 01:21:59.416
But let's check for a pulse.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:00.375
Okay.

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:11.052
No pulse.

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:43.084
He stopped right above us.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.044
Oh, my God.

01:22:45.295 --> 01:22:46.963
Oh, my God. This isn't a refuge.

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:48.339
This is a buffet line!

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.013
He knows I'm here.

01:22:55.263 --> 01:22:57.390
- He knows I'm here!
- Shh. He knows we're all here.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.477
No, you don't understand, he's trying
to get me! He knows I'm here!

01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:05.398
What was she saying?
I gotta get out of here!

01:23:06.441 --> 01:23:07.567
Let me out of here!

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.277
Oh, come on!

01:23:10.945 --> 01:23:12.238
Those were expensive glasses.

01:23:12.614 --> 01:23:13.865
This is the worst.

01:24:27.272 --> 01:24:28.231
<i>Torque...</i>

01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:29.649
<i>...engaged.</i>

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:24.162
I can't pinpoint it.

01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:26.956
It's moving quick. Keep your eyes open.

01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:32.629
<i>Choppers, do you have a visual? Over.</i>

01:26:15.296 --> 01:26:16.547
Come on!

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:41.239
I'll hold it!

01:26:41.489 --> 01:26:44.158
- Vent the coolant on the left flank!
<i>- Coolant venting.</i>

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.119
Venting coolant.

01:27:49.599 --> 01:27:51.726
<i>Atmosphere loss in progress.</i>

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:52.897
Temperature's dropping!

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:53.978
We're losing oxygen!

01:27:54.228 --> 01:27:54.896
Both plasma...

01:27:55.146 --> 01:27:55.947
...cannons are shot.

01:27:56.063 --> 01:27:57.690
We're out of options, Mako.

01:28:02.403 --> 01:28:03.821
<i>Sword deployment.</i>

01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:27.637
<i>Altitude actuation off-balance.</i>

01:28:28.763 --> 01:28:32.266
<i>50,000 feet to ground contact.</i>

01:28:34.435 --> 01:28:35.686
Look, there!

01:28:37.772 --> 01:28:38.689
<i>Altitude loss...</i>

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.399
<i>...critical.</i>

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:42.318
<i>40,000 feet.</i>

01:28:45.446 --> 01:28:46.614
<i>Gipsy,</i> listen to me!

01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:49.384
<i>Loosen all the shock
absorbers, use your gyroscope...</i>

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:50.576
<i>...as balance and ball up!</i>

01:28:50.827 --> 01:28:52.495
<i>It's your only chance!</i>

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:53.871
<i>20,000...</i>

01:28:54.121 --> 01:28:55.540
<i>...feet.</i>

01:28:56.123 --> 01:28:56.924
Fuel purge!

01:28:57.959 --> 01:28:58.960
<i>Now!</i>

01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:03.798
<i>Impact alert.</i>

01:29:04.131 --> 01:29:05.492
<i>We're coming in too fast.</i>

01:29:06.592 --> 01:29:08.469
<i>We're coming in too fast!
Brace for it, Mako!</i>

01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:39.000
Mako, talk to me.

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:43.754
Mako, you okay?

01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:44.922
Yeah.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.133
You?

01:30:02.148 --> 01:30:04.358
- Go to Dr. Geiszler now!
- Yes, sir!

01:30:04.609 --> 01:30:07.361
I want the two remaining Jaegers back
to 100 percent functionality.

01:30:07.612 --> 01:30:08.821
Yes, sir!

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:11.453
We're gonna harvest...

01:30:11.657 --> 01:30:13.701
...the skin, the talons and the wing.

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:16.329
Germans are gonna go nuts
for that stuff.

01:30:16.579 --> 01:30:18.164
Let me see that map.

01:30:20.708 --> 01:30:24.295
Here is where the Kaiju fell, here's
where we concentrate our efforts.

01:30:24.545 --> 01:30:25.755
- We'll get it, boss.
- Right.

01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:27.006
Hey!

01:30:28.758 --> 01:30:29.425
Okay.

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:32.386
Guess who's back,
you one-eyed bitch?

01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:35.181
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.

01:30:47.985 --> 01:30:48.819
Raleigh!

01:30:55.368 --> 01:30:57.286
My kid'd never admit it...

01:30:57.745 --> 01:30:58.585
...but he's grateful.

01:30:59.497 --> 01:31:00.581
We both are.

01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:07.421
Mr. Becket!

01:31:07.672 --> 01:31:08.881
Miss Mori!

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.219
In all of my years fighting...

01:31:15.596 --> 01:31:17.139
...I've never...

01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:20.101
...seen anything like that.

01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:21.978
Well done.

01:31:23.354 --> 01:31:24.397
Proud of you.

01:31:26.399 --> 01:31:27.775
Proud of us all.

01:31:28.025 --> 01:31:29.318
But...

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:33.072
...as harsh as it sounds...

01:31:33.656 --> 01:31:36.075
...there is no time to celebrate.

01:31:38.619 --> 01:31:40.663
We lost two crews.

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.083
No time to grieve.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:49.630
Reset that clock.

01:32:03.019 --> 01:32:04.020
Reset the clock.

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:39.722
I still can't believe what you did to
me. I mean, I could have been eaten.

01:32:39.972 --> 01:32:41.640
Well, that was definitely the plan.

01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:43.811
Lucky for you, that didn't
become necessary, huh?

01:32:44.435 --> 01:32:47.076
Thank you so much, you're so kind.
I really appreciate all of this.

01:32:47.313 --> 01:32:49.356
But now do you mind telling me
exactly what is taking so long...

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:51.087
...for your
workers to get that brain?

01:32:51.192 --> 01:32:53.694
Well, they pump the cavity
full of CO2...

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:55.785
...just like in any other
laparoscopic surgery.

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:57.111
Okay, yes, obviously.

01:32:57.156 --> 01:32:59.241
The CO2's gonna delay
the acidic reaction, yes.

01:32:59.492 --> 01:33:01.368
And it allows us to harvest.

01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:04.163
But our boys need oxygen
pumped into their suits.

01:33:04.413 --> 01:33:05.456
They move slow.

01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:07.625
What's going on in there, boys?

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:09.293
<i>We've reach...</i>

01:33:09.543 --> 01:33:11.545
...the upper pelvic area. Unh.

01:33:11.796 --> 01:33:14.340
Moving to the 25th vertebra.

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:16.425
Shit.

01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:21.055
Even through the suit, boss,
it smells like dead catfish in here.

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:26.310
Boss.

01:33:26.727 --> 01:33:28.771
The secondary brain...

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.439
<i>- ...is damage.</i>
- Aw.

01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:31.732
<i>- It's ruin.</i>
- Bitch!

01:33:31.982 --> 01:33:33.275
How could they screw that up?

01:33:33.526 --> 01:33:34.652
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

01:33:35.027 --> 01:33:35.736
What was that?

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:37.780
Did he say "wait"? Why wait?

01:33:40.449 --> 01:33:41.575
Do you hear that?

01:33:42.409 --> 01:33:43.953
It's like a heartbeat.

01:33:45.538 --> 01:33:48.415
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this can't be.
Hold on a second.

01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:49.959
Hey! Let me have that!

01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:52.503
Shh, shh! Listen, listen!

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:54.463
Listen to this.

01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:04.557
It's pregnant.

01:35:02.239 --> 01:35:04.408
No, no! Please.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.800
- I knew it.
- Unh.

01:35:25.596 --> 01:35:26.430
Gone.

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.600
His lungs weren't fully formed.

01:35:30.559 --> 01:35:32.811
Umbilical cord tied around his neck.

01:35:33.729 --> 01:35:37.274
No way he could survive outside
the womb for more than a minute.

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:42.029
One look, that's all I needed.
I knew he wouldn't make it.

01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:52.706
Ugly little bastard.

01:35:53.499 --> 01:35:54.250
Anyway, I would...

01:36:41.422 --> 01:36:43.132
How sick are you?

01:36:43.924 --> 01:36:45.801
And why didn't you tell me?

01:36:46.635 --> 01:36:47.678
Uh...

01:36:48.929 --> 01:36:50.764
What's to tell?

01:36:53.392 --> 01:36:58.731
You know, them Mark 1s, we scraped
them bad boys together in 14 months.

01:37:01.317 --> 01:37:04.903
Last thing we were thinking about
was radiation shielding.

01:37:06.113 --> 01:37:08.615
I ran nearly a dozen missions.

01:37:10.117 --> 01:37:12.369
I stayed under the medical radar
for a while...

01:37:13.454 --> 01:37:15.664
...but the last time I jockeyed
was in Tokyo.

01:37:15.914 --> 01:37:17.374
I finished the fight solo...

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:19.168
...but for three hours...

01:37:20.044 --> 01:37:21.211
...I burned.

01:37:21.462 --> 01:37:23.380
They warned me if I ever stepped foot...

01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:25.674
...into a Jaeger again,
the toll would be too much.

01:37:28.552 --> 01:37:31.430
You and I are the only two
that ever ran solo combat.

01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:34.141
That's why I brought you here.

01:37:44.068 --> 01:37:45.778
- What is it?
<i>- Sir, it's happening.</i>

01:37:46.028 --> 01:37:49.698
<i>I just got two signatures with
unprecedented dilation, 40-meter spikes.</i>

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:50.866
What category?

01:37:51.116 --> 01:37:52.659
<i>Checking the ratios, Category 4.</i>

01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:53.827
Where're they headed?

01:37:54.078 --> 01:37:55.954
<i>That's the thing, they're not heading
anywhere. They're hovering...</i>

01:37:56.205 --> 01:37:58.749
<i>...just above the Breach.
It's like they're protecting it...</i>

01:37:58.999 --> 01:38:02.836
<i>- ...or something.</i>
- All right, <i>Gipsy, Striker</i> on deck.

01:38:03.087 --> 01:38:05.255
Sir, Herc cannot ride. His arm...

01:38:05.506 --> 01:38:06.799
You heard me.

01:38:08.926 --> 01:38:11.303
Two signatures. Two?

01:38:12.596 --> 01:38:16.058
There are two Kaiju signatures in
the Breach, not three like I predicted!

01:38:16.308 --> 01:38:18.936
Hermann! I haven't exactly
had a very good day, okay?

01:38:19.186 --> 01:38:20.979
I got about 5 minutes...

01:38:21.230 --> 01:38:22.231
Should be three Kaijus.

01:38:22.481 --> 01:38:25.317
...before brain death occurs here!
I don't wanna spend it talking...

01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:27.368
- ...about your theories!
- This is all wrong!

01:38:27.528 --> 01:38:29.780
There should be three Kaijus
coming through, not two!

01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:32.533
There should be three and there's two?
I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong.

01:38:32.783 --> 01:38:34.993
I am not wrong, but there is something
here we don't understand.

01:38:35.244 --> 01:38:37.324
Hopefully we can argue about
any mistakes you made...

01:38:37.413 --> 01:38:40.457
...in your predictive model in the future!
But in the meantime, the neural interface...

01:38:40.707 --> 01:38:42.668
...is way off the charts!
If you want to help, help with that!

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:44.239
Newton, I am not wrong.

01:38:44.878 --> 01:38:46.672
There is only one way
to make sure...

01:38:47.339 --> 01:38:49.049
...and that is to do this...

01:38:50.092 --> 01:38:50.968
...together.

01:38:52.302 --> 01:38:53.512
I'll go with you.

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:58.267
That's what the Jaeger pilots do,
share the neural load.

01:38:58.559 --> 01:39:00.018
You're serious?

01:39:00.394 --> 01:39:02.563
You would do that for me?

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:04.690
Or you would do that with me?

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:08.277
Well, with worldwide destruction
a certain alternative...

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:10.070
...do I really have a choice?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.573
Then say it with me, my man:
"We're gonna own...

01:39:12.823 --> 01:39:13.699
...this bad boy!"

01:39:13.949 --> 01:39:18.328
By Jove, we are going to own
this thing for sure!

01:39:24.168 --> 01:39:26.128
Oi, Tendo. Tendo!

01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:28.797
You're not suited up.

01:39:29.047 --> 01:39:31.527
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.
I need to know what's going on.

01:39:31.758 --> 01:39:33.093
He said suit up, so suit up.

01:39:33.343 --> 01:39:36.597
Tendo, I can't pilot Striker
on my own, now, can I?

01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:39.224
Dad's hurt,
so who's gonna be my copilot?

01:40:01.538 --> 01:40:03.707
I don't remember it being so tight.

01:40:06.793 --> 01:40:09.505
Getting back into that Jaeger
will kill you.

01:40:12.216 --> 01:40:14.259
Not getting into one would kill us all.

01:40:14.718 --> 01:40:15.886
Listen...

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:19.056
...you are a brave girl.

01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:22.935
I'm so lucky to have seen you grow.

01:40:24.728 --> 01:40:26.813
But if I'm going to do this...

01:40:27.814 --> 01:40:30.067
...I need you to protect me.

01:40:34.905 --> 01:40:36.365
Can you do that?

01:40:41.578 --> 01:40:42.412
Right.

01:40:45.749 --> 01:40:47.084
Everyone...

01:40:48.168 --> 01:40:49.294
...listen up!

01:40:55.926 --> 01:40:57.135
Today...

01:40:58.804 --> 01:41:00.097
...today...

01:41:02.015 --> 01:41:03.892
...at the edge of our hope...

01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:08.981
...at the end of our time...

01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:15.404
...we have chosen not only to believe
in ourselves, but in each other.

01:41:18.365 --> 01:41:19.166
Today there's not...

01:41:19.408 --> 01:41:21.952
...a man nor woman in here
that shall stand alone.

01:41:23.412 --> 01:41:24.746
Not today.

01:41:26.039 --> 01:41:29.376
Today we face the monsters
that are at our door...

01:41:29.626 --> 01:41:31.712
...and bring the fight to them!

01:41:32.546 --> 01:41:35.632
Today we are canceling the apocalypse!

01:41:56.361 --> 01:41:57.529
Hey, marshal!

01:41:57.779 --> 01:41:59.219
You know, that was a great speech...

01:41:59.448 --> 01:42:01.742
...but how exactly are you and I
supposed to match up...

01:42:01.992 --> 01:42:02.951
...in there?

01:42:03.201 --> 01:42:05.329
I carry nothing into the Drift.

01:42:05.787 --> 01:42:08.040
No memories, no fear.

01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:09.458
No rank.

01:42:09.708 --> 01:42:11.335
And as for you...

01:42:11.668 --> 01:42:13.128
...well, you're easy.

01:42:13.378 --> 01:42:14.921
You're an egotistical jerk...

01:42:15.172 --> 01:42:16.012
...with daddy issues.

01:42:16.256 --> 01:42:18.717
A simple puzzle I solved on day one.

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.137
But you are your father's son...

01:42:23.513 --> 01:42:24.848
...so we'll Drift just fine.

01:42:26.683 --> 01:42:28.018
Works for me.

01:42:43.408 --> 01:42:44.409
Hey, now.

01:42:50.290 --> 01:42:51.708
<i>When you Drift with someone...</i>

01:42:53.418 --> 01:42:56.004
<i>you feel like there's nothing
to talk about.</i>

01:42:59.341 --> 01:43:00.541
I just don't want to regret...

01:43:00.676 --> 01:43:02.877
- ...all the things that I never said out loud.
- Don't.

01:43:06.765 --> 01:43:08.433
You don't need to.

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:13.063
I know them all.

01:43:14.898 --> 01:43:16.316
I always have.

01:43:19.653 --> 01:43:21.446
Hey. Hey, handsome.

01:43:24.449 --> 01:43:26.368
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

01:43:32.874 --> 01:43:34.543
You look after him for me.

01:43:36.586 --> 01:43:37.587
Stacker.

01:43:39.965 --> 01:43:41.883
That's my son you got there.

01:43:44.553 --> 01:43:46.012
My son.

01:43:51.893 --> 01:43:56.356
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent living in the past...

01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:59.568
...I never really thought
about the future.

01:44:01.445 --> 01:44:02.738
Until now.

01:44:05.115 --> 01:44:07.451
I never did have very good timing.

01:44:26.344 --> 01:44:27.554
You ready for this?

01:44:27.804 --> 01:44:31.975
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Initiating neural handshake in five...

01:44:32.225 --> 01:44:33.143
...four...

01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:34.186
...three...

01:44:34.728 --> 01:44:35.562
...two...

01:44:35.812 --> 01:44:36.480
...one.

01:45:00.086 --> 01:45:01.630
Are you okay?

01:45:02.172 --> 01:45:03.715
Yes, of course.

01:45:04.716 --> 01:45:06.510
I'm completely fine.

01:45:14.392 --> 01:45:16.311
- The Drift. You saw it?
- Yeah.

01:45:16.561 --> 01:45:18.522
- Did you?
- Listen, we have to warn them.

01:45:18.772 --> 01:45:21.858
The Jaegers... The Breach... The plan...

01:45:22.776 --> 01:45:24.361
It's not going to work.

01:45:25.445 --> 01:45:27.322
<i>Disengaging transport.</i>

01:45:37.666 --> 01:45:40.502
<i>Loccent, all ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.</i>

01:45:40.752 --> 01:45:42.170
<i>All ports sealed.</i>

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.880
<i>Ready to submerge.</i>

01:45:51.096 --> 01:45:52.931
<i>Both neural handshakes at 100 percent.</i>

01:45:53.723 --> 01:45:55.475
Neural handshake confirmed, sir.

01:45:55.725 --> 01:45:58.436
Two actives still in circle formation
in the Guam quadrant.

01:45:58.895 --> 01:46:02.148
<i>Code names: Scunner, Raiju.
Both Category 4.</i>

01:46:02.399 --> 01:46:03.279
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:46:03.692 --> 01:46:05.819
Half a mile to the ocean cliff...

01:46:06.069 --> 01:46:06.987
...we jump!

01:46:07.237 --> 01:46:09.072
It's 3000 meters to the Breach.

01:46:09.322 --> 01:46:10.907
Half a mile? I can't even see...

01:46:11.157 --> 01:46:11.741
...a damn inch ahead!

01:46:11.992 --> 01:46:14.494
<i>How are we supposed
to deliver the bomb?</i>

01:46:16.746 --> 01:46:18.081
Visibility's zero.

01:46:18.331 --> 01:46:19.624
Switching to instruments now.

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:30.176
Sir!

01:46:30.969 --> 01:46:33.138
<i>Gipsy, you have movement on your right.
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!</i>

01:46:33.388 --> 01:46:35.181
100-feet radius...

01:46:35.432 --> 01:46:37.112
<i>- ...clear.</i>
- Right flank's clear.

01:46:37.309 --> 01:46:38.184
I got nothing.

01:46:38.435 --> 01:46:41.229
Left now! And moving fast!
Fastest Kaiju on record!

01:46:45.275 --> 01:46:47.652
I don't see anything.
It's moving too fast!

01:46:47.903 --> 01:46:51.907
<i>Eyes on the prize, Gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.</i>

01:47:17.015 --> 01:47:19.684
<i>400 meters and closing.</i>

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:25.815
Bogeys are stopping.

01:47:26.983 --> 01:47:30.070
<i>Striker! Bogeys are stopping.
One o'clock.</i>

01:47:31.404 --> 01:47:32.197
Marshal, what are you doing?

01:47:32.447 --> 01:47:33.281
They're stopping.

01:47:33.531 --> 01:47:35.325
- Why the hell are they stopping?
- I don't give a damn, sir!

01:47:35.575 --> 01:47:36.952
We're 300 meters from the jump!

01:47:37.202 --> 01:47:37.994
- Something's not right!
<i>- Striker...</i>

01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:39.204
<i>...the bogeys aren't following.</i>

01:47:39.454 --> 01:47:41.289
Take the leap now.

01:47:41.539 --> 01:47:42.832
Don't do it! Don't do it!

01:47:43.083 --> 01:47:43.884
It's not gonna work!

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:46.357
Move, you fascist! Blowing up
the Breach, it's not gonna work!

01:47:46.628 --> 01:47:48.189
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?

01:47:48.296 --> 01:47:50.882
Just because the Breach is open does not
mean you're able to get a bomb through.

01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:52.759
<i>The Breach
genetically reads the Kaiju...</i>

01:47:53.009 --> 01:47:54.928
...like a barcode at the supermarket
and then lets them pass.

01:47:55.178 --> 01:47:57.847
You're gonna have to fool the Breach into
thinking that you have the same code!

01:47:58.098 --> 01:48:00.739
- And how are we supposed to do that?
<i>- By making it think...</i>

01:48:00.809 --> 01:48:01.768
...you are a Kaiju.

01:48:02.018 --> 01:48:03.603
You have to lock onto the Kaiju,
ride it into the Breach.

01:48:03.853 --> 01:48:04.974
The Throat will then read...

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:05.814
...the Kaiju's genetic code...

01:48:06.064 --> 01:48:08.104
<i>- ...and let you pass.</i>
<i>- If you don't do it...</i>

01:48:08.274 --> 01:48:09.150
<i>...the bomb will deflect off the Breach...</i>

01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:10.402
<i>...like it always has...</i>

01:48:10.652 --> 01:48:11.812
...and the mission will fail.

01:48:12.028 --> 01:48:12.696
All right.

01:48:12.946 --> 01:48:14.489
Now that you've heard all that,
<i>Striker,</i> take the leap!

01:48:14.739 --> 01:48:16.241
Sir! I have a third signature...

01:48:16.491 --> 01:48:17.784
- ...emerging from the Breach!
- Third signature...

01:48:18.034 --> 01:48:19.577
...emerging from the Breach.

01:48:19.828 --> 01:48:20.870
It's a triple event.

01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:22.455
Oh, God, I was right.

01:48:23.123 --> 01:48:23.873
How big is it?

01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:27.252
<i>- What category?</i>
- Category 5.

01:48:28.628 --> 01:48:29.379
<i>Striker...</i>

01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:31.256
<i>...it's a Category 5.</i>

01:48:31.756 --> 01:48:33.258
<i>The first ever.</i>

01:48:57.699 --> 01:48:59.860
<i>Striker, we see him.
We're right behind you...</i>

01:49:00.035 --> 01:49:00.994
<i>...about 100 meters.</i>

01:49:01.244 --> 01:49:03.913
<i>We're gonna come around
your 3 o'clock, try to flank him.</i>

01:49:04.164 --> 01:49:05.957
<i>Standard two-team formation.</i>

01:49:06.207 --> 01:49:07.447
<i>Just keep him busy for a few...</i>

01:49:19.888 --> 01:49:20.930
Brace for impact!

01:49:28.897 --> 01:49:29.617
<i>Chain sword...</i>

01:49:29.731 --> 01:49:30.315
<i>...deployed.</i>

01:49:55.131 --> 01:49:57.383
<i>Let's get this son of a bitch!</i>

01:50:18.905 --> 01:50:19.697
<i>Gipsy, coming up...</i>

01:50:19.948 --> 01:50:20.828
<i>...on your 12 o'clock!</i>

01:50:21.074 --> 01:50:22.992
<i>Full speed!</i>

01:50:23.243 --> 01:50:24.702
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

01:50:44.806 --> 01:50:46.726
The release is jammed!
We can't deliver...

01:50:46.808 --> 01:50:48.143
<i>...the payload, sir!</i>

01:50:48.726 --> 01:50:50.228
<i>We're still armed.</i>

01:50:50.478 --> 01:50:52.188
But the hull is compromised!

01:50:52.438 --> 01:50:53.799
Half our systems are offline, sir.

01:50:54.023 --> 01:50:55.233
We need to override the...

01:51:43.489 --> 01:51:44.157
Both Kaijus...

01:51:44.407 --> 01:51:45.607
...converging on <i>Striker</i> fast!

01:51:48.286 --> 01:51:49.996
<i>Hang on, Striker!</i>

01:51:50.246 --> 01:51:52.081
<i>- We 're coming to you!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

01:51:52.332 --> 01:51:54.000
<i>Gipsy! Do not come to our aid!</i>

01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:55.001
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:51:55.251 --> 01:51:57.492
- Hang on!
<i>- Stay as far back as you can!</i>

01:51:57.629 --> 01:52:00.006
We can still reach you.
We're coming for you.

01:52:00.882 --> 01:52:02.467
No, Raleigh, listen to me.

01:52:02.717 --> 01:52:04.385
You know exactly what you have to do!

01:52:04.636 --> 01:52:05.762
<i>Gipsy is nuclear!</i>

01:52:06.012 --> 01:52:07.513
<i>Take her to the Breach!</i>

01:52:07.764 --> 01:52:09.015
I hear you, sir.

01:52:09.265 --> 01:52:10.683
Heading for the Breach.

01:52:10.934 --> 01:52:12.134
<i>- Structural damage...</i>
- Now.

01:52:12.185 --> 01:52:13.228
<i>- ...eighty percent.</i>
- Unh.

01:52:14.354 --> 01:52:15.146
<i>Mako.</i>

01:52:15.605 --> 01:52:16.272
<i>Listen.</i>

01:52:18.358 --> 01:52:20.276
You can finish this.

01:52:21.653 --> 01:52:23.947
I'll always be here for you.

01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:27.075
You can always find me in the Drift.

01:52:32.664 --> 01:52:33.623
We're a walking...

01:52:33.873 --> 01:52:35.250
...nuclear reactor.

01:52:35.625 --> 01:52:37.460
We can destroy the Breach.

01:52:51.099 --> 01:52:52.934
<i>What can we do, sir?</i>

01:52:53.184 --> 01:52:55.228
We can clear a path!

01:52:55.895 --> 01:52:57.397
For the lady!

01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:59.774
They're gonna detonate the payload.

01:53:02.735 --> 01:53:04.946
If you have the shot, you take it!

01:53:05.697 --> 01:53:07.323
<i>So let's do this!</i>

01:53:10.493 --> 01:53:11.995
It was a pleasure, sir.

01:54:10.136 --> 01:54:13.139
<i>All systems critical. Fluid loss.</i>

01:54:13.806 --> 01:54:15.683
Systems are critical!

01:54:15.933 --> 01:54:17.602
Fuel is leaking!

01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:18.852
Our right leg's crippled!

01:54:18.936 --> 01:54:20.563
<i>Code red.</i>

01:54:20.813 --> 01:54:22.565
- Let's finish this.
<i>- All systems critical.</i>

01:54:22.815 --> 01:54:24.233
What are they doing?

01:54:24.901 --> 01:54:26.361
Finishing the mission.

01:54:26.611 --> 01:54:27.945
<i>Loccent. We have...</i>

01:54:28.196 --> 01:54:29.364
<i>...the Kaiju carcass.</i>

01:54:29.614 --> 01:54:30.782
<i>We're heading for the Breach.</i>

01:54:34.035 --> 01:54:35.661
<i>You guys better be right.</i>

01:54:35.912 --> 01:54:37.872
<i>Because one way or another...</i>

01:54:38.247 --> 01:54:40.500
<i>...we 're getting this thing done.</i>

01:54:51.928 --> 01:54:54.889
On my count, rear jets!

01:54:55.139 --> 01:54:56.140
Three...

01:54:56.391 --> 01:54:57.475
...two...

01:54:57.725 --> 01:54:58.476
...one.

01:54:58.726 --> 01:54:59.227
Now!

01:55:08.528 --> 01:55:09.779
Hold on.

01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:25.128
Mako's oxygen is down. Half capacity!

01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:28.172
- Can you reroute it?
- I'm trying, sir.

01:55:28.423 --> 01:55:29.344
Hold on, Mako.

01:55:30.174 --> 01:55:31.467
- Heat shaft purge.
- I'm gonna burn...

01:55:31.717 --> 01:55:32.927
<i>...this son of a bitch.</i>

01:55:51.487 --> 01:55:52.196
They're in.

01:55:52.447 --> 01:55:54.365
- They're in!
- It worked.

01:56:08.713 --> 01:56:10.006
<i>Oxygen main...</i>

01:56:10.256 --> 01:56:12.300
<i>...left hemisphere, critical levels.</i>

01:56:13.509 --> 01:56:14.302
<i>Operating at...</i>

01:56:16.095 --> 01:56:17.638
<i>...fifteen percent capacity.</i>

01:56:18.306 --> 01:56:20.266
<i>Ten percent capacity.</i>

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:21.934
<i>Five percent.</i>

01:56:22.268 --> 01:56:23.561
He's giving her his oxygen.

01:56:27.857 --> 01:56:28.816
It's okay now, Mako.

01:56:30.067 --> 01:56:31.527
We did it.

01:56:32.236 --> 01:56:34.113
I can finish this alone.

01:56:35.031 --> 01:56:36.741
All I have to do is fall.

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:39.494
Anyone can fall.

01:56:40.036 --> 01:56:40.717
<i>Raleigh...</i>

01:56:40.953 --> 01:56:41.913
<i>...your oxygen levels...</i>

01:56:42.163 --> 01:56:44.624
<i>...are critical now.
You don't have much time.</i>

01:56:45.124 --> 01:56:48.628
<i>Start the core meltdown and
get out of there. Do you hear me?</i>

01:56:48.878 --> 01:56:50.087
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

01:56:58.179 --> 01:57:01.224
One pod is ejected. No detonation, sir.

01:57:01.474 --> 01:57:02.892
<i>Loccent, if you
can still hear me...</i>

01:57:03.142 --> 01:57:04.060
...I'm initiating...

01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:06.187
...reactor override now.

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:08.940
<i>Manual activation...</i>

01:57:09.106 --> 01:57:10.608
<i>...required.</i>

01:57:10.858 --> 01:57:11.526
What's going on?

01:57:11.776 --> 01:57:13.653
Trigger's offline!
He has to do it by hand.

01:57:13.903 --> 01:57:15.704
He's out of time.
He has to self-destruct now.

01:57:18.324 --> 01:57:21.285
<i>Manual activation required.</i>

01:57:32.547 --> 01:57:34.173
No!

01:57:52.191 --> 01:57:54.193
Manual override initiated.

01:57:54.443 --> 01:57:56.946
Core meltdown in T-minus 60.

01:57:57.196 --> 01:58:00.491
<i>Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.</i>

01:58:03.452 --> 01:58:05.121
<i>Fifty seconds.</i>

01:58:37.862 --> 01:58:39.322
<i>Evac pod engaged.</i>

01:58:46.704 --> 01:58:47.830
<i>Five...</i>

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:50.249
<i>...four, three...</i>

01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:53.544
<i>...two, one.</i>

01:58:53.794 --> 01:58:55.129
<i>Reactor meltdown.</i>

01:59:02.219 --> 01:59:04.972
Direct hit! The Breach has collapsed!

01:59:07.642 --> 01:59:11.187
To the choppers! To the choppers now!

01:59:28.245 --> 01:59:29.955
Visuals on first pod.

01:59:30.206 --> 01:59:33.292
<i>Tracking solid. Vital signs are good.</i>

01:59:38.631 --> 01:59:40.257
Okay, where's the second pod?

01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:43.552
I'm tracking it,
but I'm getting no vital signs.

02:00:11.122 --> 02:00:12.832
<i>I can't find his pulse.</i>

02:00:13.249 --> 02:00:14.625
<i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>

02:00:14.875 --> 02:00:17.336
Can you read his pulse?
Does he have a pulse?

02:00:17.586 --> 02:00:18.671
<i>Raleigh?</i>

02:00:19.338 --> 02:00:20.631
<i>Mako, listen to me.</i>

02:00:20.881 --> 02:00:22.442
<i>It could be the sensors are networking.</i>

02:00:23.426 --> 02:00:24.719
<i>We can't be sure.</i>

02:00:24.969 --> 02:00:25.928
No.

02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:28.764
No. Don't go.

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:30.975
- Please.
<i>- Mako.</i>

02:00:31.767 --> 02:00:32.935
Don't go.

02:00:33.185 --> 02:00:34.395
<i>Mako.</i>

02:00:36.814 --> 02:00:37.898
<i>No.</i>

02:00:38.399 --> 02:00:40.568
Don't go. Please.

02:00:43.028 --> 02:00:45.348
You're squeezing me too tight.

02:00:51.996 --> 02:00:53.831
I couldn't breathe.

02:01:09.555 --> 02:01:11.515
This is Marshal Hercules Hansen.

02:01:12.391 --> 02:01:14.101
<i>The Breach is sealed.</i>

02:01:15.269 --> 02:01:16.562
Stop the clock!

02:01:44.590 --> 02:01:45.591
<i>Mako, Raleigh.</i>

02:01:45.841 --> 02:01:48.177
<i>We have your position.
The choppers are on their way.</i>

02:01:48.427 --> 02:01:49.553
<i>Just hang on.</i>

02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:54.433
<i>Are you okay?</i>

02:01:55.476 --> 02:01:57.019
<i>Do you copy?</i>

02:01:58.354 --> 02:02:00.648
<i>Uh, guys?</i>

02:04:59.952 --> 02:05:03.205
Where is my goddamn shoe?

02:05:04.305 --> 02:05:10.593
