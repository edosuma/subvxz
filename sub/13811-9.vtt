Maybe not for me!

What -- What's
the matter, Squid?

01:24.876 --> 01:25.919
Not scared, are you?

Oh, little Squiddy
is scared of the wave!

01:28.838 --> 01:31.007
He's afraid he's
going to get whomped.

Squiddy, Squid.

He doesn't have to surf it
if he doesn't want to.

01:38.973 --> 01:39.724
Any other takers?

01:39.808 --> 01:42.894

Mmm, guess I'm not
in the mood.

03:37.717 --> 03:42.305

Go check out Madtown, maybe.

03:42.388 --> 03:46.142
Great idea!
I'm getting out of this.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.478

are awesome.

{\an1}Yeah, Otto,
this is a wicked swell.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.067
Sure, but, uh, we've been
on the waves a lot lately.

You don't want
to wear them out.

shoobies here today.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.293
It's -- It's Shoobie City!

04:54.377 --> 04:56.963
But we're practically
the only the people here.

barney over there?

04:59.424 --> 05:01.801

to grab their blades?

the "Otto Grind"!

Hey, that was close.

Can you imagine
if I really fell?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.122
Whoa! Unh!

05:31.205 --> 05:34.625
Might have been...
pretty gnarly.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.378
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

05:37.462 --> 05:39.589
( screaming )

05:39.672 --> 05:46.346

05:46.429 --> 05:49.015
Twister: Hey, Otto! What's up
with the slow cruise style?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.641
Thought you were
going to bust a grind.

05:50.725 --> 05:54.937
Nah, I just want to work
on my...form, you know.

05:55.021 --> 05:55.938
Your form?

05:56.022 --> 05:58.608
Yeah. Like, maybe
you should get some!

05:58.691 --> 06:00.109
Man, this is weak.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.695
I'm taking off my blades
and checking out of here!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.447
But you're the one
who wanted

06:04.530 --> 06:06.616
to go blading
in the first place!

06:06.699 --> 06:09.744
Yeah, you're all no surfing,
no skateboarding.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.120
Pretty soon it'll be,
like, no living!

06:11.204 --> 06:13.831
What's wrong, Otto?

06:13.915 --> 06:17.752
Nothing. This is boring,
that's all. I'm over it.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.214
{\an8}♪♪

06:21.297 --> 06:23.132
{\an1}Can you believe Otto's
missing this swell?

06:23.216 --> 06:26.052
{\an1}He keeps bailing
on everything.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.471
It's almost like
he's somebody else.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.225
Yeah, almost like a...
sh-shoobie.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.977
Something is
seriously wrong.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.688
And yet
strangely familiar.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.983
( screaming )

06:41.067 --> 06:43.945
That's it!
He's scared, like Sammy!

06:44.028 --> 06:46.823
-No way!
-No, I think she's right.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.700
He's displaying
all of the classic symptoms --

06:49.784 --> 06:51.285
irritability,
avoidance of heights,

06:51.369 --> 06:54.288
of all dangerous activities.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.332
{\an3}Must be from when he got
whomped on that wave.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.293
Twister: That's it!
You're crazy!

06:59.377 --> 07:01.003
{\an1}Trust me, if there's
one thing I know about,

07:01.087 --> 07:03.464
it's being scared.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.176
Otto's not scared,
and I'll prove it!

07:07.260 --> 07:10.263
{\an8}♪♪

07:10.346 --> 07:11.973
( tires squealing )

07:12.056 --> 07:14.392
Hey, Otto, man!

07:16.144 --> 07:18.062
( softly ) Hey.

07:18.146 --> 07:18.855
I know this is
totally wacked,

07:18.938 --> 07:21.232
but these guys think

07:21.315 --> 07:22.692
{\an3}that the reason you're not
surfing and stuff is --

07:22.775 --> 07:27.029
Well, they think you're --
you're all scared.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.156
You're not, right?

07:28.239 --> 07:31.993
No way, 'course not!
That's weak!

07:32.076 --> 07:34.745
( sighs ) Cool.
Then come on down, man!

07:34.829 --> 07:37.165
We're taking our bikes out,
and you'll totally rip.

07:37.248 --> 07:42.003
It'll be
Otto-matic!

07:42.086 --> 07:47.258
( screaming )

07:47.341 --> 07:50.386
Sorry, dude.
I got...homework.

07:50.469 --> 07:54.056
-Did you say homework?
-Yeah, homework!

07:54.140 --> 07:55.725
Ever heard of it?

07:55.808 --> 08:00.563
Homework. Man, it's true.
Otto is scared.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.356
-We have to talk to him.
-Allow me.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.484
I speak the language
of fear.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.447
{\an8}♪♪

08:09.530 --> 08:11.991
Come on, Otto.
You can do this thing.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.159
It's nothing.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.244
( Sam clears throat )

08:15.328 --> 08:16.746
Looks pretty steep, huh?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.080
I know that feeling.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.750
{\an3}Man, you shouldn't sneak up
on someone like that!

08:20.833 --> 08:22.627
You know, fear is
a funny thing.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.254
I told you guys,
I'm not scared.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.756
I know just what you mean.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.507
Admitting it
is the hardest part.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.467
{\an1}The thing is,
it comes out anyway.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.178
{\an1}Like the traditional
wipeout dream

08:32.260 --> 08:34.138
where you keep crashing
and falling...

08:34.222 --> 08:35.556
You mean you
have the same --

08:35.640 --> 08:38.476
Why would I dream
about wiping out?

08:38.558 --> 08:39.727
That's wacked!

08:39.809 --> 08:42.355
Sometimes you have to start
with baby steps.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.775
Try some risk-free activities.
Play a board game, read a book.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.693
There's nothing
wrong with me, Squid!

08:47.777 --> 08:52.949
{\an3}Just get out of here!
I want to be alone!

08:53.032 --> 08:54.909
( slurping )

08:54.992 --> 08:56.410
Well?

08:56.494 --> 09:00.539
( sighs )
A textbook case of denial.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.457
So, where's my
little Otto cuz?

09:01.540 --> 09:04.710
His body was snatched
by a shoobie.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.754
He means Otto
lost his nerve.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.381
But he won't admit it.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.590
Well, my friends

09:09.674 --> 09:11.592
like the ancient
Hawaiian saying goes --

09:11.676 --> 09:13.886
"A coconut is
a hard nut to crack.

09:13.970 --> 09:19.141
{\an3}Then again, it takes something
hard to crack the coconut."

09:19.225 --> 09:20.142
All: Huh?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.144
Sometimes the problem
is the solution.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.773
Yeah!
Yeah, that's it!

09:25.856 --> 09:27.817
The way Otto won't
admit he's scared --

09:27.900 --> 09:29.443
that's how we're
going to help him.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.486
What?

09:30.569 --> 09:32.530
You're not
making sense, Reg.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.782
Come on!
I'll explain later!

09:34.865 --> 09:40.329
{\an8}♪♪

09:40.413 --> 09:43.082
Are you sure this is
a good idea, Reg?

09:43.165 --> 09:44.834
Otto's not
going to like it.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.169
Trust me.
It's the only way.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.838
I know my brother.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.841
Hey, Rocket Boy!

09:51.924 --> 09:53.009
How about
a little challenge?

09:53.092 --> 09:57.346
Just you and me, bro.
Rocket versus Rocket.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.180
On the waves.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.640
First one to
get tubed wins.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.226
No, thanks. Think I'll
just catch some rays.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.937
Wait. Did I hear right?

10:05.021 --> 10:07.857
Hey, everybody,
can you believe this?

10:07.940 --> 10:10.860
Otto Rocket
turning down a challenge?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.237
( crowd murmuring )

10:13.321 --> 10:14.613
Boy: Otto's scared!

10:14.697 --> 10:18.159
Later, Reg.
Not now, okay?

10:18.242 --> 10:21.871
The great Otto Rocket, awesomest
surfer in Ocean Shores.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.082
Now look at him. Won't even
surf against his sister!

10:25.166 --> 10:28.377
( crowd exclaims )

10:28.461 --> 10:30.087
I'm not scared!

10:30.171 --> 10:32.381
Then show me.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.841
Fine. I'll show you.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.678
You going to take it?

10:37.762 --> 10:40.389
Um, maybe --
maybe the next one.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.726
Okay. Guess this one
goes to Rocket Girl.

10:43.809 --> 10:47.938
Let's see. If I'm the winner,
that makes you...

10:48.022 --> 10:50.441
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

10:50.524 --> 10:53.569
( panting )

10:53.652 --> 10:54.195
Yeah!

10:54.278 --> 11:00.826
{\an8}♪♪

11:00.910 --> 11:06.540
{\an8}♪♪

11:06.624 --> 11:07.708
Got it!

11:07.792 --> 11:10.252
Way to go, bro!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.088
( cheering )

11:12.171 --> 11:14.131
That was pretty harsh, Reg.
But thanks.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.384
No prob, bro.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.428
{\an1}Only way to deal with a stubborn
Rocket Boy like you.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.596
Nice work, Otto!

11:20.679 --> 11:25.643
Dude, you're --
you're not a shoobie!

11:25.726 --> 11:27.144
{\an5}Dude, what are
you doing?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.771
Uh, Sammy?

11:28.854 --> 11:32.942
{\an3}Sorry about giving you
such a hard time before.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.318
You just surf
whatever waves you want.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.320
No pressure, man.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.114
Aw, no worries, Otto.

11:38.197 --> 11:42.201
Unlike <i> some</i> people,
I admit it when I'm scared.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.537
Like for instance
right now.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.454
( screaming )

11:45.538 --> 11:48.207
( others laughing )

11:53.045 --> 12:01.345
{\an8}♪♪

12:01.429 --> 12:03.806
( loud clicking )

12:03.889 --> 12:07.643
{\an8}♪♪

12:07.726 --> 12:10.104
( kids exclaiming and cheering )

12:10.187 --> 12:12.440
{\an8}♪♪

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
That was awesome!

12:14.942 --> 12:16.569
I can't believe
I kept up with you guys!

12:16.652 --> 12:19.071
You guys down
to bomb it again?

12:19.155 --> 12:22.491
{\an3}Sure, but, Twist, what's
with the lame sound effects?

12:22.575 --> 12:26.036
{\an1}Lame? It sounds like I put
a motor on this bad boy.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.498
{\an3}No, it sounds like you put
a trading card in your spoke.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.209
Take it out, bro.
It's mega-annoying.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.752
All right, all right.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.672
I forgot I even had
these surf cards

12:36.755 --> 12:38.924
till my mom made me
clean under my bed.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.342
Check this one out.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.721
A Rhino rookie card!

12:43.804 --> 12:46.432
Twist, you got to let me
score that card.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.684
No way!
This is my favorite one.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.187
Check out the colors.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.732
( flatly ) Wow. This is
super-interesting.

12:54.815 --> 12:58.694
Are we going to
keep riding or what?

12:58.777 --> 13:02.865
Sam, Reg, you guys go on.
We'll catch up.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.952
Whatever.
Come on, Sam.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.914
Twist, have I ever shown you
<i>my</i> favorite card?

13:09.997 --> 13:13.375
{\an8}♪♪

13:13.459 --> 13:15.920
{\an1}I'll show this to you
but don't touch it, okay?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.087
Okay, okay.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.341
This is the rarest,
most awesomest surf card

13:20.424 --> 13:21.342
known to anyone.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.469
Anywhere.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.596
Um, there's
nothing on it.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.515
Exactly, dude!

13:27.598 --> 13:29.266
{\an1}A card with nothing
on either side

13:29.350 --> 13:30.726
in mint condition.

13:30.809 --> 13:34.313
Wow. Nothing
on either side.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.982
It's ultra-rare.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.193
That card
is awesome.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.738
{\an3}So, what would you want
for a card like that?

13:42.821 --> 13:44.281
Are you kidding me?

13:44.365 --> 13:47.493
{\an1}I'd never trade this away
in a million, billion years!

13:47.576 --> 13:50.120
Aw, come on,
Otto, please.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.540
I don't know, man.

13:52.623 --> 13:56.752
Well, how about I trade you
my favorite card?

13:56.835 --> 14:00.172
Your Rhino card?
Are you joking?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.716
( giggles )

14:02.800 --> 14:04.176
Okay, Twist.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.886
Because you're
my best bud

14:05.970 --> 14:07.429
and I can tell you
really like the card,

14:07.513 --> 14:11.183
I'll do the trade.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.395
All right!
Thanks, Otto, man!

14:14.478 --> 14:16.605
Hey, hey!
What are best buds for?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.608
( smooches loudly )

14:19.692 --> 14:20.693
{\an8}♪♪

14:20.776 --> 14:22.152
Tito:
Hey, little cuzzes.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.904
{\an1}Say, where's
Otto and Twister?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.322
I think they're
trading surf cards.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.949
Trading surf cards!

14:27.032 --> 14:28.867
Say, Tito, remember
that time you traded me

14:28.951 --> 14:32.621
for my Duke Kahanamoku
autographed photo?

14:32.705 --> 14:36.125
Uh, yeah, brother.
Yeah, yeah...

14:36.208 --> 14:40.462
{\an8}♪♪

14:40.546 --> 14:42.506
I don't know, Tito. Are you
sure this is a fair trade?

14:42.590 --> 14:45.593
It's winter, brother.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.971
{\an1}You know how hard it is
to find ripe bananas?

14:49.054 --> 14:52.433
{\an3}RAY: And it was the
best trade I ever made.

14:52.516 --> 14:53.892
Those bananas
were delicious.

14:53.976 --> 14:58.230
A bunch of bananas for a Duke
Kahanamoku autographed photo?

14:58.314 --> 15:03.152
{\an1}Yep. Your old man really got
the best of Tito that day.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.655
{\an3}( chuckling ) Yeah.
You sure did, brother.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.200
( whistling
innocently )

15:10.284 --> 15:11.493
Hey, isn't that
Twister's card?

15:11.577 --> 15:14.455
Twister: Not anymore.
We traded. Check this out.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.373
( humming idly )

15:16.457 --> 15:17.499
( slurping )

15:17.583 --> 15:20.794
It doesn't look like
there's anything on it.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.964
{\an5}You traded your Rhino away
for a blank piece of cardboard?

15:24.048 --> 15:28.177
This card happens
to be ultra-rare.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.014
Really. How come you've never
shown me that card, Otto?

15:33.599 --> 15:34.975
Because, Reg,
only a serious collector

15:35.059 --> 15:38.062
would care about
a card this sweet.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.688
{\an1}Anyway, me and Twist are
on our way to the card shop

15:39.772 --> 15:42.483
to buy containers
for these.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.901
Let's roll, Twist!

15:43.984 --> 15:48.947
Uh...hmm.
Something's not right here.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.949
Sam, what do you say you and me
teach a certain someone

15:51.033 --> 15:55.204
{\an3}a little lesson about
ripping off his friends?

15:55.287 --> 15:58.540
{\an1}But I don't think Raymundo
knows he got ripped off.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.875
Not Raymundo.
Twister!

15:59.958 --> 16:03.671
Come on. We're going
to the card shop.

16:03.754 --> 16:07.007
{\an8}♪♪

16:07.091 --> 16:09.259
( bell dings, door closes )

16:11.387 --> 16:13.013
Excuse me. Can I look
at this card?

16:15.766 --> 16:20.521
{\an1}Cool. And can you help me
with one other thing?

16:20.604 --> 16:22.856
( whispering )

16:22.940 --> 16:27.444
{\an8}♪♪

16:27.528 --> 16:29.822
Can I help you?

16:29.905 --> 16:34.076
{\an3}Do you have a special
cardholder I can put this in?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.327
Are you kidding me?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.871
You've got the 1995
double-sided error card?!

16:37.955 --> 16:42.084
The 1995 double-sided
error card?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.961
I can't believe
I'm holding this.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.921
Can't believe
you're holding what?

16:46.004 --> 16:49.466
{\an5}The blank-on-both-sides
'95 error card!

16:49.550 --> 16:53.929
There's only one in existence!
This card is gold, kid! Gold!

16:54.012 --> 16:56.598
Gold?! But I thought
it was just a...

16:56.682 --> 16:57.558
I mean -- What?!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.017
Kid, you're going to need

16:59.101 --> 17:02.521
the best cardholder
we've got for that baby.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.981
{\an3}Cool!

17:04.064 --> 17:06.775
But -- But -- I --
But -- Huh?!

17:10.529 --> 17:14.657
{\an8}♪♪

17:14.742 --> 17:16.617
Now, we've got to make sure
Otto trades him

17:16.702 --> 17:18.954
something big to
get that card back.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.957
This is going to
be so good!

17:22.040 --> 17:25.042
{\an8}♪♪

17:25.127 --> 17:29.006
Say, Twist.
I've been thinking.

17:29.089 --> 17:32.009
I know how much you like
that Rhino card,

17:32.092 --> 17:35.220
so I'd be cool with doing
a trade-back, if you want.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.805
Reggie:
If you guys trade,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.641
you'll have to give him
something really good, Otto.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.435
That error card
is the bomb.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.479
He knows, Reg.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.147
{\an8}♪♪

17:45.230 --> 17:48.150
{\an3}Twister: Yeah, I'm pretty
stoked on that card.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.986
SAM: Maybe you can
sweeten the deal, Otto.

17:51.069 --> 17:55.824
All right, how about my new
trucks and your Rhino card?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
Your new trucks
<i>and</i> the Rhino card?

17:58.410 --> 18:01.205
I don't know, Twist.
Sounds sort of weak.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.582
Yeah, Otto, what are you
trying to do?

18:03.665 --> 18:05.083
Rip off your friend?

18:05.167 --> 18:08.420
Rip off my friend?
No way!

18:08.504 --> 18:11.298
Okay, Twist.
My new trucks, the Rhino card,

18:11.381 --> 18:12.508
and I'll rewax
your surfboard.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.678
{\an8}♪♪

18:16.762 --> 18:19.973
I don't know, Otto.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.893
All right!
Look. Get the card.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.228
Meet me at Madtown
in half an hour,

18:24.311 --> 18:27.314
I guarantee you'll
change your mind.

18:27.397 --> 18:34.780
{\an8}♪♪

18:34.863 --> 18:37.699
( Sam and Reggie cheering )

18:37.783 --> 18:41.370
( chuckling )

18:41.453 --> 18:44.373
Otto: Bust out the error card,
Twist, my man.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.458
Whatever you want is yours.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.418
The error card?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.254
Uh, w-well, uh...

18:50.337 --> 18:54.550
{\an3}gee, Otto, I kind of already
traded it to Trish.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.218
-Huh?!
-What?!

18:56.301 --> 18:57.553
To Trish?!

18:57.636 --> 19:00.222
Yeah, for this awesome board
I'm riding.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.682
I saw her on my way here,

19:01.765 --> 19:03.892
and she said Eddie told her
about the card and that --

19:03.976 --> 19:07.396
Trish?! Dude, we were
supposed to trade!

19:07.479 --> 19:09.064
Reggie: Yeah, Twist.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.233
You were supposed to
trade with Otto.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.276
Man, I'm sorry, bro.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.946
Dude, how could you
do this to me?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.614
Well, maybe you guys
can find Trish,

19:17.698 --> 19:21.201
Twister can trade back with her,
and then you two can trade.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.828
This board <i> is</i> kind of sweet.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.539
Reggie: Twister!

19:25.622 --> 19:27.457
Okay!

19:30.127 --> 19:31.253
Good thinking, Sam,

19:31.336 --> 19:33.172
{\an3}but now we've got to find
Trish before they do

19:33.255 --> 19:36.258
{\an3}and make sure she trades
that card back to Twister.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.843
{\an8}♪♪

19:37.926 --> 19:40.262
What's going on, guys?

19:40.345 --> 19:43.056
Trish, we need
to do a trade-back

19:43.140 --> 19:44.016
for that card I gave you.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.476
You're a little late,
Twist.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.395
{\an3}I already traded it to Sherry
for this surfboard.

19:48.478 --> 19:54.443
Sherry?! Oh, man! Come on.
You got to help us find her.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.945
( panting )

19:57.029 --> 19:57.613
( yelping )

19:57.696 --> 19:59.573
Watch out!

19:59.656 --> 20:02.826
You kids gotta pay attention
to where you're going.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.870
Yeah, we know.
You seen Trish anywhere?

20:04.953 --> 20:08.290
Trish? Yeah. I think I saw her
go thataway with Twist and Otto.

20:08.373 --> 20:12.211
With Twist and Otto?!
Oh, no! Come on, Sam!

20:12.294 --> 20:14.630
-Hey, there she is!
-Sherry!

20:14.713 --> 20:17.466
{\an3}I got to trade you something
for that error card!

20:17.549 --> 20:20.010
Error card?
Sorry, Otto.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.511
I already swapped it to Eddie
for these blades.

20:21.595 --> 20:24.389
All: Eddie?!

20:24.473 --> 20:26.516
I don't see her anywhere!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.477
Maybe they went
to Trish's house.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.520
Come on! We're running
out of time!

20:30.604 --> 20:33.732
{\an8}♪♪

20:33.815 --> 20:36.860
Eddie: Apologies, but the card
you seek has thus been bartered.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.947
-Huh?
-I traded it.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.114
To who?

20:41.198 --> 20:43.075
Girl:
Yeah, I got the card.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.327
And I ain't trading it!

20:45.410 --> 20:47.120
Come on, MacKenzie.

20:47.204 --> 20:50.082
Not even for a nice,
bouncy skate wheel?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.500
Wheel, huh? Okay.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.253
Hmm. Skateboard, too, eh?
That looks good.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.631
And hockey sticks.
A hat!

20:57.714 --> 21:00.509
All right.
I'll take it.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.512
All of it?
You don't even use this stuff.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.306
Take it
or leave it, buster.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.016
{\an8}♪♪

21:08.100 --> 21:10.435
I'll take it!
I'll take it!

21:10.519 --> 21:12.938
( laughs ) Yes!

21:13.021 --> 21:15.983
( kids yelling excitedly )

21:16.066 --> 21:19.027
( exclaiming )

21:19.111 --> 21:21.488
Hey, Otto's got
the card back!

21:21.571 --> 21:23.115
What's he doing?

21:23.198 --> 21:26.034
Looks like he's trying
to trade it again.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.536
-Wait!
-Stop!

21:27.619 --> 21:30.622
Nobody give him
anything for that card!

21:30.706 --> 21:33.000
( panting )
It's worthless!

21:33.083 --> 21:34.376
-Huh?!
-What?!

21:34.459 --> 21:36.461
What do you mean,
worthless?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.171
{\an1}We knew you tricked Twister
out of his Rhino card,

21:38.255 --> 21:41.133
{\an1}so we started a rumor about that
fake card to get you back.

21:41.216 --> 21:44.469
You mean...
you set me up?

21:44.553 --> 21:45.846
{\an1}Sam: We were just trying
to teach you a lesson.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.140
I got tricked?

21:48.223 --> 21:50.267
But I traded away
all my stuff.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.729
-Trade's a trade!
-Yeah, Otto!

21:53.812 --> 21:55.981
-Trade's a trade.
-Trade's a trade.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.232
-That's right.
-That's right.

21:57.315 --> 21:58.567
That's great.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.446
Everybody gets cool stuff,
and I get ripped off!

22:02.529 --> 22:04.823
Uh...

22:04.906 --> 22:07.951
Best buds, huh?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.911
{\an8}♪♪

22:09.995 --> 22:12.789
Hold up, bro. Wait!

22:12.873 --> 22:14.249
I'm sorry, Twist.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.917
I just really
wanted that card.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.461
But I got totally
carried away.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.755
You <i> are</i> my best bud.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.215
But I guess I didn't
act like yours.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.594
Here.
This belongs to you.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.513
I'm sorry, bro.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.808
Well, how about we trade?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.351
I mean, if MacKenzie's
got your board,

22:33.435 --> 22:36.354
how are we supposed
to shred Madtown?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.440
Does this mean
we're buds again?

22:38.523 --> 22:40.108
Best of!

22:40.192 --> 22:42.486
Both:
Woogie, woogie, woogie, woogie!

22:42.569 --> 22:44.446
( card clicking against spokes )

22:44.529 --> 22:47.491
Twister: Man, this one sounds
even better than the other one.

22:47.574 --> 22:50.702
This is definitely
my new favorite card.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.454
-Twister!
-Oh, man!

22:52.537 --> 22:54.122
( laughing )

22:54.206 --> 22:56.541
Whatever, dude.

22:58.085 --> 23:06.843
{\an8}♪♪

23:06.927 --> 23:15.685
{\an8}♪♪

23:15.769 --> 23:23.819
{\an8}♪♪

23:23.902 --> 23:33.662
{\an8}♪♪

23:39.000 --> 23:41.837
{\an8}Twister: Dude, you're --
you're not a shoobie!
