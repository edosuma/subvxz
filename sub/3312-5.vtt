00:06.140 --> 00:09.977
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.712
Boy in film: We
can't do it, Mom.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.147
We'll never beat those guys.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.083
Mom: Well, Cody,

00:15.116 --> 00:17.718
you've got something that
big-city team doesn't have...

00:17.751 --> 00:21.089
- you've got a whole town that believes in you.
- ( crying )

00:21.122 --> 00:23.124
I BELIEVE IN YOU, CODY.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.027
- TISSUE?
- NO.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.630
( crowd in film cheering )

00:29.663 --> 00:33.000
- ( cellphone rings )
- YO, NOT MUCH.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.736
JUST WATCHING A MOVIE.
NAH, IT'S PRETTY LAME.

00:35.769 --> 00:39.073
- Crowd: SHH!
- HOW MANY CALLS IS THIS GUY GONNA TAKE?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.609
- SOMEONE SHOULD SHOVE THAT PHONE DOWN HIS THROAT.
- ( man laughs )

00:41.642 --> 00:43.644
- IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.
- NO, JOE.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.046
LOOK, I'D LIKE TO DECK HIM TOO, BUT
WE CAN'T IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.182
- Man: YEAH, WELL...
- DAMN IT. WHY DID WE BRING THE KIDS?

00:48.216 --> 00:50.184
KIDS RUIN EVERYTHING.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.186
WE CAN HEAR YOU, YOU KNOW.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.021
SO YOU SAW THIS ONE?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.756
- OH MY GOD.
- ( Mel sighs )

00:55.789 --> 00:59.693
- THE KID LOSES THE BIG GAME?
- ( people moan )

00:59.727 --> 01:01.162
SOMEONE HAS TO TALK TO THIS GUY.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.198
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM WITH MR.
CHUCK AND MR. NORRIS.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.767
JOE, WE HAVE TO SET
A GOOD EXAMPLE.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.703
- SINCE WHEN?
- I READ THIS IN A MAGAZINE

01:09.737 --> 01:11.205
ABOUT CONTROLLING YOUR TEMPER.

01:11.239 --> 01:15.075
IT WAS A DOG MAGAZINE, BUT
THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.778
SO HOW'S YOUR BROTHER?
IS HE STILL A DOUCHE?

01:17.811 --> 01:20.047
OH, GO GET AN USHER.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.749
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.787
- Man: NAH, I GOT TIME.
- HEY, YOU ARE MAKING IT

01:26.820 --> 01:29.723
- REALLY HARD FOR ME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.
- ( beeps )

01:29.757 --> 01:32.226
YOU KNOW WHAT'S MAKING IT HARD
FOR ME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE?

01:32.260 --> 01:35.229
THIS BEANPOLE FREAK OF NATURE
HERE BLOCKING MY VIEW.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.731
( gasps ) YOU DID NOT TOUCH HIM!

01:37.765 --> 01:40.801
- I THINK I DID.
- NO, YOU DON'T TOUCH HIM.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.837
- OR WHAT?
- ( people murmuring )

01:45.239 --> 01:49.243
OR I WILL GET THE MANAGER.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.245
YOU GO DO THAT, BLONDIELOCKS.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.714
- YOU GO DO THAT.
- ( scoffs )

01:55.283 --> 01:57.151
- ( woman gasps )
- ( Lennox laughing )

01:57.185 --> 01:59.187
( crowd cheers )

02:02.723 --> 02:04.258
WE'RE GOOD. HE'S QUIETED DOWN.

MORNING, MEL. I WAS JUST
GONNA BEAT THESE EGGS,

02:32.286 --> 02:33.854
BUT I FIGURE YOU
MIGHT WANNA DO IT,

02:33.887 --> 02:35.789
'CAUSE ONE PUNCH...
BOOM... OMELET.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.926
LET'S GET READY TO SCRAMBLE!

02:40.261 --> 02:43.130
OKAY, IF THIS IS
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.266
I TOTALLY REGRET MY ACTIONS.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.167
THAT PUNCH WAS NOT WHO I AM.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.737
WHAT, ARE YOU MORE
OF AN EAR-BITER?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.272
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, COUNCILWOMAN?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.907
AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS
OF YOU CALLING ME A HOTHEAD,

02:53.941 --> 02:56.143
WHO'S THE ONE WHO DECKS THE PERSON
FOR TALKING IN THE MOVIE THEATER?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.313
HOLD ON, LET ME SAVOR
THIS DELICIOUSNESS.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.749
YOU. YOU KNOW WHY?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.785
BECAUSE YOU ARE JUST LIKE ME.
HA!

03:05.853 --> 03:07.788
I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.158
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES EVEN A RATIONAL
PERSON CAN BE PUSHED TO A POINT,

03:11.191 --> 03:13.761
FOR INSTANCE, WHEN HER
CUB IS THREATENED.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.797
CUB? THIS KID IS LIKE 8' TALL.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.300
- YOU REALLY WANNA POKE THE MAMA BEAR?
- ( chuckles )

03:19.333 --> 03:22.803
CAN WE JUST MOVE ON? I DON'T WANT
THIS TO DEFINE ME, YOU KNOW?

03:22.836 --> 03:25.839
WOULD YOU WANNA BE KNOWN ONLY AS THE
GUY WHO WORKED FOR THAT COMPANY

03:25.873 --> 03:27.841
THAT SWINDLED PEOPLE OUT
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS?

03:29.810 --> 03:31.879
THAT IS ALL I'M KNOWN FOR.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.814
HEY, AUNT MEL, LOOK.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.350
SOMEBODY SHOT VIDEO OF YOU AT
THE MOVIE THEATER LAST NIGHT.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.286
- YOU'VE GONE VIRAL.
- OH.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.321
"BLONDE DECKS CELLPHONE GUY.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.256
WHO IS THIS HOT-HEADED HOTTIE?"

03:42.290 --> 03:45.793
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET SOMEONE ELSE
TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT, ARE YOU?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.295
YES, I AM. THE INTERNET AND I

03:47.328 --> 03:49.229
ARE ALREADY VERY
WELL ACQUAINTED.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.333
THAT'S FOR SURE.
WHATEVER YOU DO,

03:52.366 --> 03:54.935
DO NOT GOOGLE "OHIO SENATOR'S
DAUGHTER FLASHES WORLD

03:54.968 --> 03:57.271
STEPPING OUT OF A LIMO
IN A SHORT SKIRT."

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
HEY, IT WAS LAUNDRY DAY.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.843
YOU DID A LOT OF
LAUNDRY BACK THEN.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.916
HARPER, THIS IS NOT A
GOOD TIME FOR A MEETING.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.352
WE HAD AN APPOINTMENT. HEY,
YOU'RE LUCKY I SHOWED UP.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.954
MY OVARY'S THE SIZE
OF A BASEBALL.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.292
- SO NO DONUT HOLES FOR ME.
- THE NEWS IS BAD, MEL...

04:18.326 --> 04:21.362
- POOP-HITTING-THE-FAN BAD.
- WELL, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:21.395 --> 04:23.331
HE THREATENED ME AND
MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.232
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.835
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.970
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
POLLING RESEARCH.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.839
AS AM I.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.974
I AM HERE TO GET YOU RE-ELECTED.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.243
DO YOU SEE THIS LINE HERE?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.246
LIKE MY ESTROGEN, YOU
ARE TRENDING DOWN.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.982
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE A
STRONG ENOUGH BRAND.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.884
30% OF THE RESPONDENTS THINK

04:43.917 --> 04:46.320
THAT YOU'RE THAT PERKY WEATHER
GIRL WHO'S BANGING THE MAYOR.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.889
- UCK! I WOULD NEVER.
- UCK ALL YOU WANT,

04:48.922 --> 04:52.292
BUT PEOPLE KNOW WHO SHE IS. AND IT
WOULDN'T KILL YOU TO WEAR A PUSH-UP BRA.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.365
WAIT, 4% OF PEOPLE THINK MEL
BURKE IS A CITY IN AUSTRALIA?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.032
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE

04:59.066 --> 05:01.001
OR THEY JUST DON'T
SEE YOU AT ALL.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.404
WHERE'S MEL? I DON'T SEE MEL.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.972
OH. ( laughs )

05:05.005 --> 05:08.275
THERE YOU ARE. SOMEONE
JUST SENT THIS TO ME.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.978
IS THIS YOU COLDCOCKING
A GUY AT THE MOVIES?

05:11.011 --> 05:13.914
- NOT NOW, NOT NOW.
- OH, THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER UP?

05:13.947 --> 05:16.884
I LOST MY HEAD, OKAY?
THIS IS NOT WHO I AM.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.019
I'M A NEGOTIATOR, A
CONSENSUS MAKER.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.022
THIS VIDEO MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A
SHORT, WHITE, FEMALE MIKE TYSON.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.025
NO NO NO, THIS IS SICK.
I LOVE IT.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.429
YOU KNOW, VOTERS ALWAYS WORRY THAT A WOMAN
IN PUBLIC OFFICE ISN'T TOUGH ENOUGH,

05:28.462 --> 05:32.966
THAT SHE CAN'T HANDLE A FIGHT. I CAN
TOTALLY SPIN THIS LIKE A DREIDEL.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.403
WELL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE ASSAULT AND BATTERY

05:35.436 --> 05:37.070
SEEM REASONABLE AND RATIONAL?

05:37.104 --> 05:41.308
LIKE THIS: "FINALLY SOMEONE
HAS THE BIG, BLONDE COJONES

05:41.341 --> 05:43.444
TO DEAL WITH ONE OF THOSE
MOVIE-THEATER JERKS.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.346
THREE CHEERS FOR
COUNCILWOMAN MEL BURKE."

05:46.380 --> 05:49.417
- WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU, INSANE?
- OH, FOR SURE.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.419
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOU'RE GONNA BE KNOWN

05:51.452 --> 05:53.387
AS FIGHTER FOR THE
LITTLE PEOPLE.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.322
- YAY, LITTLE PEOPLE!
- YEAH.

05:55.355 --> 05:59.059
OKAY, LOOK, HARPER, I KNOW YOU'VE
TURNED AROUND A LOT OF CAMPAIGNS

05:59.092 --> 06:02.463
I NEVER LOSE. AND DON'T YOU
FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT I DO,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.331
OTHER UNBIASED CITIZEN?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.467
YES. BOY, DO I.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.937
WELL, THEN LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD
IN THE COMMENT SECTION RIGHT THERE.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.440
"BATTLING BURKE
SURE GETS MY VOTE.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.476
WHO SAYS WOMEN CAN'T DISH IT OUT?
NOT ME, BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY...

06:15.509 --> 06:18.111
- SEND. SEND, STEPHANIE.
- WHOA WHOA, WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.980
ARE WE SURE THIS IS THE
SMARTEST STRATEGY?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.482
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL JUST
TAKE A BREATH HERE.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.117
- SURE, AFTER YOU PRESS "SEND."
- ( beeps )

06:24.151 --> 06:26.487
( laughs ) NOW WE
CAN ALL BREATHE.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.456
( strained ) NOT YET.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.059
( school bell rings )

06:32.092 --> 06:36.029
WOW, I RECOGNIZE THAT
BURRITO FROM MY OLD SCHOOL.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.131
I HEARD IT GOT PREGNANT
AND DROPPED OUT.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.534
( laughs ) WHATEVER, I'M HUNGRY.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.407
CREEPY NEW GIRL HESTER EATS BY HERSELF
AT THAT TABLE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.510
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE'S CREEPY?

06:49.543 --> 06:52.480
HER GENERAL CREEPITUDE.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.414
SHE NEVER TALKS TO ANYBODY.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.150
SHE JUST SCRIBBLES IN HER
LITTLE BOOK AND EATS WALNUTS...

06:57.184 --> 07:01.121
- NOTHING BUT WALNUTS.
- SHE'S JUST NEW.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.423
I WAS NEW LAST YEAR. IT'S HARD.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.994
YEAH, I REMEMBER. I
HATED YOU LAST YEAR.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.596
HEY, ONE PERSON CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.602
IT'S HESTER, RIGHT?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.138
THIS MAY BE A FEW WEEKS LATE,

07:18.171 --> 07:21.108
BUT WELCOME TO
GRANT HIGH SCHOOL.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.044
- WHO ARE YOU?
- OH.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.046
I'M YOUR NEW FRIEND...
LENNOX SCANLON.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.182
YOU WANNA SHARE AN UNWED
BURRITO FROM THE '90s?

07:30.183 --> 07:33.186
AMAZING... 537 COMMENTS ALREADY?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.588
THIS COULD MOVE MY
COMMANDO PICTURE

07:34.622 --> 07:36.490
TO THE SECOND PAGE OF
MY GOOGLE SEARCH...

07:36.524 --> 07:38.492
IF SUCH PHOTOS EXISTED.

07:38.526 --> 07:42.095
OH, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. "GOD
BLESS BATTLING MEL BURKE

07:42.129 --> 07:45.465
FOR MAKING OUR MOVIE THEATERS SAFE AGAIN.
AND HOW GREAT IS HER HAIR?"

07:45.499 --> 07:48.035
- ( laughs )
- EVEN IN A BRAWL IT HOLDS ITS CURL.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.138
- THE PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN.
- BYE-BYE, WEAK POLLING DATA.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.040
- AND HELLO SECOND TERM.
- YES.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.075
( snapping out of sync )

08:05.519 --> 08:07.154
THANKS FOR COMING
OVER TO MY HOUSE.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.090
WELL, YOU DIDN'T LEAVE
ME MUCH CHOICE.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.526
YEAH, BUT THIS'LL BE FUN.
I MEAN A NEW FRIEND?

08:12.560 --> 08:15.495
HOW GREAT IS THAT? 'CAUSE YOU
AND I HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.264
YOU HAVE COLITIS TOO?

08:19.266 --> 08:22.570
NO, I MEAN I WRITE ALL THE TIME

08:22.603 --> 08:25.472
AND I SEE YOU WRITING. YOU KNOW,
YOU AND ME, US WRITERS...

08:25.505 --> 08:28.542
WE BOTH HAVE WORDS JUST
EXPLODING OUT OF US, RIGHT?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.210
YOU SURE DO.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.248
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT?
I KNOW YOU LIKE WALNUTS.

08:35.282 --> 08:39.252
WE EVEN HAVE PISTACHIOS
IF YOU WANNA GO NUTS.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.157
HOW LONG IS THIS PLAYDATE
SUPPOSED TO LAST?

08:45.225 --> 08:48.528
HEY, LENNOX. HEY,
LENNOX'S FRIEND.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.497
I'M NOT TECHNICALLY HER FRIEND.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.133
BUT I'M WORKING ON IT.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.702
APPARENTLY I'M HER PROJECT.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.637
SHE'S ENTERING ME IN
THE SCIENCE FAIR.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.172
( laughs ) NO. NO.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.174
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
BACK-AND-FORTH THING WE DO.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.644
YOU KNOW, SHE'S THE DRY
ONE, I'M THE GOOFY ONE.

09:05.212 --> 09:09.216
ANYWAY, HESTER, THIS IS JOE
AND HE AND I ARE GONNA

09:09.249 --> 09:11.318
- GET YOU THAT SNACK.
- OKAY.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.655
- ( chuckles )
- ( chuckles nervously )

09:14.688 --> 09:16.323
- WE'RE GONNA GO OVER...
- YEAH.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.627
WOW, SHE'S A HAPPY ONE.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.662
I INVITED HER OVER
BECAUSE SHE'S NEW.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.231
TO WHAT, THE HUMAN RACE?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.667
OKAY, I WAS NEW LAST YEAR. I
HAD A HARD TIME FITTING IN,

09:26.700 --> 09:29.302
AND I'M GONNA DO FOR HER WHAT
SOMEONE SHOULD'VE DONE FOR ME.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.239
GET HER A PERSONALITY
TRANSPLANT?

09:32.272 --> 09:34.642
MAKE HER A FRIEND. BRING
HER OUT OF HER SHELL.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.310
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, JOE.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.680
SHE'S ME.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.219
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
LOOKING IN A MIRROR.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.259
- HEY.
- HEY THERE.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.728
OH, SO TELL ME...
ANY BACKLASH TODAY

09:54.762 --> 09:59.299
FROM THE TWO-FISTED JUSTICE YOU DISPENSED
IN THE MOVIE THEATER LAST NIGHT?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.769
NO, IT DID NOT COME UP.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.672
GREAT, SO YOU CAN JUST
PUT IT BEHIND YOU,

10:04.705 --> 10:07.340
- PRETEND LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.
- EXACTLY MY PLAN.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.277
NICE. NICE. OH, ON A
TOTALLY UNRELATED MATTER,

10:10.310 --> 10:13.280
THESE DRAWINGS OF YOU
WEARING BOXING GLOVES

10:13.313 --> 10:14.648
WERE FAXED OVER FROM
YOUR OFFICE TODAY.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.351
I LIKE THIS CONCEPT
FOUR HERE THE BEST,

10:18.385 --> 10:22.322
'CAUSE I THINK IT TRULY
CAPTURES THE BLOODLUST.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.758
WELL, HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW THOSE ARE ME?

10:24.792 --> 10:28.228
WELL, BECAUSE IT SAYS
"BATTLING BURKE."

10:28.261 --> 10:32.265
IT'S JUST A LITTLE IDEA MY
CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT HAD.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.635
- FOR A MAILER. IT'S A METAPHOR.
- METAPHOR?

10:35.669 --> 10:39.239
IS THAT THE NEW, HIP TERM FOR
"YOU'RE KIDDING YOURSELF"?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.308
JOE, THE VIDEO WENT VIRAL.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.811
AT LEAST NOW WE'RE IN
CONTROL OF THE MESSAGE.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.646
I WASN'T SO SURE THIS MORNING, BUT THIS
IS TURNING OUT TO BE A VERY GOOD DAY.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.616
THIS MIGHT'VE BEEN
THE WORST DAY EVER.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.753
WELL, IT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO
DO WITH MY BADA-BING, DID IT?

10:52.786 --> 10:55.255
OH, IT HAD EVERYTHING TO
DO WITH YOUR BADA-BING.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.790
TO EVERYONE ON EARTH WITH
A COMPUTER OR PHONE,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.726
I'M THE BIG WEENIE WHOSE
LITTLE BLONDE AUNT

10:58.759 --> 11:00.660
HAD TO DEFEND HIM IN
THE MOVIE THEATER.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.662
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, BUDDY.
ALL THE KIDS ARE GONNA

11:02.696 --> 11:06.633
FORGET ABOUT THAT AS SOON AS
THIS WHOLE INTERNET FAD IS OVER.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.836
AND THIS ONE 11th GRADE KID,

11:08.869 --> 11:11.671
DONNIE KEATON, WOULD NOT LET
IT GO, AND I WAS WITH HOLLY.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.741
DUDE DISSED ME IN
FRONT OF MY WOMAN.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.310
AND YOU JUST WALKED AWAY, RIGHT?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.813
NO, I TOLD HIM TO KNOCK
IT OFF AND THEN...

11:19.847 --> 11:22.816
- THEN HE CHALLENGED ME TO A FIGHT.
- AND THEN YOU WALKED AWAY?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.684
I COULDN'T DO THAT.
I WAS WITH HOLLY.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.387
- I HAVE A REPUTATION.
- NO, I DON'T THINK YOU DO, BUD.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.292
RYDER, YOU DO KNOW THAT FIGHTING IS
THE WRONG WAY TO RESOLVE AN ISSUE?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.694
WHAT, SO IF HE HITS ME,
I JUST DON'T HIT BACK?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.830
NOW WOULDN'T THAT BE A
POWERFUL STATEMENT?

11:36.864 --> 11:39.666
- ( cellphone rings )
- THINK ABOUT IT.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.835
HEY, HARPER. YEAH, I'M
LOOKING AT THE CONCEPTS NOW.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.405
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT PINK BOXING GLOVES?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.841
- OKAY, JOE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
- NO, MAN.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.743
THERE'S NO WAY I'M
TEACHING YOU HOW TO FIGHT.

11:49.777 --> 11:53.480
- AUNT MEL WOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW.
- YES, RYDER, BUT I WOULD KNOW.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.750
I'M JUST KIDDING, MAN.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.853
OH YEAH, WHO'S THE
WEENIE NOW, HUH?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.923
NOT ME. MY NANNY'S
TEACHING ME HOW TO FIGHT.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.864
SO IS IT TRUE THAT MOST
BULLIES ARE JUST TALK?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.732
NO, THEY CAN KICK
SOME SERIOUS ASS.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.468
ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?
HERE WE GO.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.737
- I'M COMING AT YOU.
- OH, DUDE.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.739
- OW.
- OW?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.809
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BLOCK. THAT
WAS THE STRATEGY, REMEMBER?

12:21.842 --> 12:23.443
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET THIS
BULLY PUNCH HIMSELF OUT.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.712
HOW DO YOU KNOW SO
MUCH ABOUT BOXING?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.881
BECAUSE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU HAD
TO LEARN HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.783
I TOOK OUT MANY A
BULLY TWICE MY SIZE.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.485
- SO YOUR DAD TAUGHT YOU?
- NO, MY MOM...

12:32.519 --> 12:34.822
AND MY AUNT CECILIA.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.757
YEAH, YOU DID NOT WANT TO
MESS WITH THOSE LADIES.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.392
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
PUNCH, LET'S GO.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.794
- ONE, TWO. OH HEY, HI.
- JOE.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.729
WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.497
BEAT EACH OTHER SENSELESS.
I DON'T CARE.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.433
I'M LOOKING FOR MY NOTEBOOK...

12:46.466 --> 12:48.768
THE SPIRAL ONE WITH ALL MY
ENGLISH LIT NOTES IN IT?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.838
HERE, HOLD THESE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.908
IT WAS RIGHT HERE ON THE TABLE WHEN
YOU WERE WORKING HERE WITH, UM...

12:54.942 --> 12:57.544
WHAT'S HER NAME? BEETLEJUICE.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.482
HER NAME IS HESTER.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.884
OH, WELL, THEN JUST
BORROW HESTER'S NOTES.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.920
SHE DIDN'T TAKE ANY.
SHE'S HAVING

13:06.954 --> 13:09.456
A REALLY HARD TIME
ADJUSTING TO A NEW SCHOOL.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.391
NO ONE EVEN TALKS TO HER.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.894
WELL, EXCEPT FOR ME BECAUSE
I'M A GOOD PERSON.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.529
WELL, GOOD PERSON,
SINCE YOU TOOK NOTES

13:16.563 --> 13:18.932
AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE ANY, I THINK
YOU GOT YOURSELF A THIEF.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.970
LOOKS LIKE HESTER IS A HEISTER.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.839
WHAT'S YOUR EVIDENCE?

13:25.873 --> 13:28.408
UM, SHE WAS OVER HERE,
SHE LOOKS CREEPY...

13:28.441 --> 13:29.877
SHE DID IT.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.913
EVERYONE IS INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.849
OH, SWEETIE, THAT'S
JUST AN EXPRESSION.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.819
I WOULD BET IT'S IN THAT
BIG, RATTY BACKPACK OF HERS.

13:39.853 --> 13:43.790
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY TO VERIFY
YOUR WILD, PARANOID THEORY.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.992
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'D BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT

13:45.025 --> 13:47.027
UNLESS WE GET HER BACK OVER
HERE AND GO THROUGH IT.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.931
FINE, I WILL DO THAT.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.866
JUST TO PROVE HOW WRONG YOU ARE.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.802
YOU KNOW WHAT, LENNOX?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.504
I THOUGHT I WAS WRONG ONCE.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.873
TURNS OUT I WAS MISTAKEN.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.978
WE NEED TO GO. YOU'RE
DUE AT THE ARMORY.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.846
YOU'LL SPEAK, SHAKE SOME HANDS

14:06.880 --> 14:08.548
AND THEN WE'LL HEAD OVER
TO THE ATHLETIC CLUB.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.517
YOU'RE BOOKED SOLID
FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.553
- EVERYBODY LOVES BATTLING BURKE.
- YOU KNOW, I GOTTA SAY

14:13.586 --> 14:15.923
AT FIRST I WASN'T SO SURE,
BUT THIS IS KINDA FUN.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.857
IT SAYS "EXPRESS LINE,

14:17.891 --> 14:19.559
EIGHT ITEMS OR LESS."

14:19.592 --> 14:21.561
YOU'VE GOT 15 THINGS HERE.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.830
I'M ALREADY HERE.
WHAT'S THE BIG WHOOP?

14:23.863 --> 14:27.034
IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT
RUIN IT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.471
( scoffs ) HEY, IT'S MEL BURKE.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.940
BATTLIN' BURKE!

14:32.973 --> 14:34.607
- ( chuckles ) HEY.
- ( all talking )

14:34.641 --> 14:38.011
MEL, MEL, LOOK WHAT
THIS GUY'S DOING.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.847
- IT'S INJUSTICE!
- WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY INJUSTICE.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.515
IT'S JUST MAYBE A
LITTLE ANNOYING.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.918
COME ON, PUNCH HIM OUT
LIKE IN THE VIDEO.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.520
- ( people talking )
- OKAY, COME ON, EVERYBODY.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.056
IS VIOLENCE REALLY THE
WAY TO SOLVE THIS?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.524
- Woman: YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.
- People: YEAH.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.561
- SIR, CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?
- ( gasps )

14:54.594 --> 14:57.530
( laughs ) YOU DID IT.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.867
- JUSTICE!
- ( crowd cheering )

15:00.900 --> 15:03.903
ANOTHER EVIL-DOER PUT IN HIS
PLACE BY BATTLING BURKE!

15:03.937 --> 15:07.674
( crowd cheers ) BURKE! BURKE!
BURKE! BURKE! BURKE!

15:11.611 --> 15:13.446
REFILL YOUR ICE TEA
THERE, HESTER?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.914
FOURTH ONE'S THE CHARM.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.916
NO, I CAN'T DRINK ANYMORE.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.420
- WHERE'S YOUR BATHROOM?
- TOP OF THE STAIRS TO THE LEFT.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.595
- CLEAR.
- THAT TOOK A LOT MORE ICE TEA THAN I THOUGHT.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.597
I KNOW, SHE MUST
HAVE A HUGE BLADDER.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.566
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN HERE.
HERE WE... UCK.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.468
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE GOT?

15:35.502 --> 15:37.504
WE GOT A SWEATER, BOOK,

15:37.537 --> 15:38.671
- SHRUNKEN HEAD...
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.607
YES, I AM. IT'S AN AVOCADO.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.509
WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT...
WHAT'S THIS?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.511
- OH, THAT LOOK FAMILIAR?
- OH MY GOSH,

15:44.544 --> 15:46.980
- THAT'S MY NOTEBOOK.
- SHOCKER.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.917
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU STOLE MY NOTEBOOK.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.453
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.954
YOU WERE OFFERING
ME NUTS AND STUFF

15:54.988 --> 15:57.957
- AND SO I FIGURED...
- THAT MY NOTEBOOK WAS UP FOR GRABS TOO?

15:57.991 --> 15:59.959
I GUESS, YEAH.

15:59.993 --> 16:03.630
SO AM I REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO
TELL YOU THAT STEALING IS WRONG?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.599
THE FIRST PERSON TO
SPIT WHEN SHE SAID IT.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.636
OKAY, LET ME GIVE YOU THE WHOLE
RUNDOWN OF HOW LIFE WORKS.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.005
DON'T STEAL. BE NICE TO PEOPLE.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.507
- SMILE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
- ALL RIGHT, EASY, GIRL.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.610
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OTHER FOODS
IN THE WORLD BESIDES WALNUTS.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.612
RETURN KINDNESS WHEN
KINDNESS IS OFFERED TO YOU,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.981
- AND I WAS FRICKING KIND TO YOU.
- YOU'RE SPITTING AGAIN.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.651
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, DIDN'T YOU
EVER GO TO KINDERGARTEN?

16:24.684 --> 16:27.054
I THINK I SHOULD GO. YOUR
NOTES WEREN'T EVEN THAT GOOD.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.989
OH!

16:30.023 --> 16:32.625
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I SAID
THAT WE'RE SO MUCH ALIKE?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.594
I WAS WRONG. YOU'RE
NOTHING LIKE ME.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.029
I AM A SWEET, WONDERFUL PERSON

16:36.063 --> 16:38.665
WHO GIVES AND GIVES AND GIVES!

16:40.067 --> 16:43.536
- HOO!
- COME BACK AND SEE US AGAIN, HESTER.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.076
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. AFTER
EVERYTHING I DID FOR HER.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.679
YEAH.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.582
OH, THAT'S THE LOOK
YOU GIVE AUNT MEL.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.051
THAT'S THE I-TOLD-YOU-SO LOOK.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.587
LENNOX, YOU ACTUALLY
THINK I LIKE

17:00.620 --> 17:02.589
BEING RIGHT ALL THE TIME?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.692
WELL, I DO.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.698
SO I TAKE ONE STEP TOWARDS HIM
AND HE TEARS OUT OF THE DOOR.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.600
AND EVERYBODY'S
YELLING "BURKE HIM!"

17:13.633 --> 17:16.669
LOOK AT YOU, GIRL... YOU'RE A VERB.
I LIKE IT.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.772
"OUT OF MY WAY, YOU DUMB
BASTARD, OR I'LL BURKE YA."

17:19.806 --> 17:22.675
NOW THAT'S BRANDING. COME HERE.
STAND OVER HERE.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.012
- OKAY.
- HEY, HARPER, I'M SORRY I EVER QUESTIONED YOU.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.748
NOW YOU KNOW BETTER. OKAY,
LET'S GET YOU RE-ELECTED.

17:28.781 --> 17:32.085
- NOW DO THIS. GIVE ME YOUR KILLER LOOK.
- ( camera clicking )

17:32.119 --> 17:34.787
MAYBE YOUR OTHER KILLER LOOK.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.590
MMM, MAYBE JUST SMILE.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.659
( camera clicking )

17:39.692 --> 17:41.794
HEY, AWESOME DAY, BEST DAY EVER.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.763
RYDER! OH MY GOSH, WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR LIP?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.533
SO DONNIE KEATON AMBUSHES
ME AFTER 4th PERIOD...

17:46.566 --> 17:49.602
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
- AND, JOE, JOE, YOUR STRATEGY WORKED.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.671
DONNIE PUNCHED AND PUNCHED,
AND I DUCKED AND DODGED

17:51.704 --> 17:54.574
AND WAITED FOR MY OPENING AND THEN...
( grunts ) I BURKED HIM.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.743
- YES.
- YOU BURKED HIM?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.778
SEE? IT'S CATCHING ON.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.781
I'M MAKING T-SHIRTS, GETTING MY
GRAPHICS GUY ON IT RIGHT NOW.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.617
WAY TO GO, BUDDY. I GOTTA
CALL MY MOM AND LET HER KNOW,

18:04.651 --> 18:08.688
'CAUSE IT'S HER MOVE. WELL,
HERS AND, UM, MUHAMMAD ALI'S.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.557
WHOA WHOA, YOU FOUGHT HIM?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.592
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT THE WAY
YOU SETTLE A DISAGREEMENT.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.827
OH, STOP IT, BURKE. YOU'RE PROUD AS HELL.
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?

18:14.861 --> 18:17.597
BECAUSE I'M PROUD AND
YOU ARE JUST LIKE ME.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.699
- I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU.
- SURE YOU ARE.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.801
YOU PRETEND TO BE ALL CIVILIZED,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

18:21.834 --> 18:24.137
WHEN PUSH COMES TO
SHOVE, YOU SHOVE.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.806
( knocks ) IS THIS
RYDER SCANLON'S HOUSE?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.708
WHO'S ASKING?

18:28.741 --> 18:31.144
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THUG
THAT BEAT UP MY SON DONNY?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.647
THE PERSON WEARING
THE BOXING GLOVES.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.816
LOOK, I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.785
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE
TASTE OF WHAT MY SON GOT TODAY?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.086
WHOA WHOA, LADY, LADY.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
LET'S JUST ALL BE
CIVILIZED HERE, OKAY?

18:42.155 --> 18:44.691
( chuckles ) PUT THESE ON.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.728
NO NO NO NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO MORE FIGHTING.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.164
WE ARE DONE BEHAVING
LIKE ANIMALS.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.734
RYDER, WHAT I DID IN THE
MOVIE THEATER WAS WRONG,

18:54.767 --> 18:56.836
WHAT YOU DID TO DONNIE WAS WRONG

18:56.869 --> 18:59.839
AND WHAT DONNIE DID
TO RYDER WAS WRONG.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.874
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE ARE
WE SENDING OUR KIDS?

19:01.908 --> 19:03.843
I DON'T KNOW... THAT ONE?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.148
YEAH, WELL, MEL BURKE
IS REBRANDING.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.718
I AM TAKING OFF THE
GLOVES, NOW AND FOREVER.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.888
MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW, BUT
AS SOON AS I FIND A SAW.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.157
OKAY, LOOK, HERE'S WHAT
I THINK WE SHOULD DO...

19:18.191 --> 19:19.792
I'M GONNA SPEND SOME
TIME WITH MY NEPHEW,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.828
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND LOOK AFTER YOUR SON.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.698
YEAH, MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.767
I WILL.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.203
I THINK WE'RE BOTH SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.705
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.874
ARE YOU THAT WEATHER
GIRL ON CHANNEL 5?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.777
I AM.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.815
SMART MOVE NOT
FIGHTING HER, BURKE.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.917
I DON'T THINK YOU WERE
QUITE IN HER WEIGHT CLASS.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.221
RYDER, GO PUT SOME ICE ON THAT.
I'LL BE IN THE KITCHEN IN A MINUTE.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.224
I HOPE IT LEAVES A SCAR.
CHICKS DIG SCARS.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.226
YEAH, THEY DO.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.729
HEY, IT'S TIME TO
RETIRE BATTLING BURKE.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.897
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, BUT
BEFORE WE DO THAT...

19:57.930 --> 19:59.866
A MOMENT AGO WHEN SHE
WAS SHOVING YOU,

19:59.899 --> 20:02.735
THERE WASN'T SOMETHING DEEP DOWN INSIDE
WHERE YOU JUST WANTED TO POP HER BACK?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.804
NO, NOT POP HER.

20:04.837 --> 20:08.875
- BITCH SLAP HER.
- SEE, THAT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.877
EVERYBODY'S GOT AN AGGRESSIVE STREAK.
IT'S JUST HOW YOU CHANNEL IT.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.845
IT'S HOW YOU WORK IT OUT.
TELL YOU WHAT...

20:12.879 --> 20:14.914
LET'S WORK A LITTLE OF YOUR
AGGRESSION OUT RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.917
GIMME A GOOD ONE. COME ON.
NICE NICE NICE NICE.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.820
OKAY, NOW... WAIT WAIT. TRY TO POP
ME RIGHT HERE. ( clicks tongue )

20:20.853 --> 20:22.955
- I DON'T WANNA.
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT. LET'S GO. COME ON.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.292
LET'S GO. COME ON.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.829
THIS IS STUPID. I'VE GOT
NO MORE FIGHT LEFT.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.831
- I GIVE UP.
- ( chuckles ) OKAY.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.934
- ( grunts )
- ( laughs )

20:34.967 --> 20:36.836
♪ HA! YOU GOT BURKED.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.215
SO YOU'RE FLYING
SOLO TODAY, HUH?

20:49.248 --> 20:53.219
WHERE'S YOUR SWEET,
PSYCHOTIC FRIEND?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.554
WHAT, SHE GO BACK
TO THE MOTHER SHIP?

20:56.556 --> 20:59.258
HESTER HAS ACTUALLY
CLEANED UP HER ACT.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.328
SHE SAYS HELLO TO
PEOPLE AT LUNCH.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.364
SHE SMILES ONCE IN A WHILE.
SHE'S EVEN TRYING OTHER NUTS.

21:06.399 --> 21:10.236
WOW, SO YOU BERATED HER
INTO BEING A BETTER PERSON.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.406
I DID. ( laughs ) JUST
LIKE I SAID I WOULD.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.343
OH JEEZ, I KNOW THAT LOOK.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.311
THAT'S THE LOOK I GET FROM
YOUR AUNT ALL THE TIME

21:18.345 --> 21:20.547
WHEN SHE THINKS SHE'S
BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.451
- AND YOU DON'T LIKE THAT LOOK?
- NO NO, I'M KINDA USED TO IT.
