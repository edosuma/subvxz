WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:05.100
- SO WHAT'S HER NAME?

00:05.100 --> 00:07.100
- ANGELA.
- OH, UH-HUH.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.600
AND WHERE DID YOU MEET HER?

00:08.600 --> 00:11.233
- WELL, I WENT TO GET A TRIM
OVER AT THE HAIR BARN.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.033
AND THEY HAVE THIS GUY
WHO'S WORKING THERE,

00:13.033 --> 00:14.367
ARMANDO, YOU KNOW,

00:14.367 --> 00:16.233
AND I LIKE THE WAY
HE DOES MY SIDEBURNS.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.367
ANYWAY, HE DOUBLE BOOKED.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.767
I HAD A 3:15
AND ANGELA HAD A 3:15.

00:21.767 --> 00:23.133
[breathes deeply]

00:23.133 --> 00:25.100
OKAY.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.667
AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

00:26.667 --> 00:29.000
- YOU GOT A BAD HAIRCUT
AND NOW YOU'RE DATING?

00:30.633 --> 00:35.100
- YES, WE'RE DATING,
AND ANGELA LIKES MY HAIR.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.967
- SO HOW MANY DATES
HAVE YOU BEEN ON?

00:36.967 --> 00:38.767
- WELL, TONIGHT
WAS THE THIRD ONE,

00:38.767 --> 00:43.167
AND I KNOW IT'S KIND OF EARLY,
BUT I'M GETTING THIS FEELING.

00:43.167 --> 00:47.367
I DON'T KNOW--
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE...

00:47.367 --> 00:50.467
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
"THE ONE"?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.933
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU THINK
ANGELA MIGHT BE THE ONE?

00:52.933 --> 00:54.033
- ALL RIGHT, WHOA.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.433
LET'S NOT JUMP THE GUN, OKAY?

00:55.433 --> 00:57.100
I MEAN, DON'T FORGET,

00:57.100 --> 00:59.733
HE MARRIED ONE
THAT WASN'T THE ONE.

01:01.900 --> 01:03.933
- SO WHEN ARE WE GONNA MEET HER?

01:03.933 --> 01:05.533
- WELL, LISTEN,
I WOULD LOVE THAT,

01:05.533 --> 01:07.367
BUT I'M A LITTLE AFRAID
ABOUT BRINGIN' HER OVER HERE

01:07.367 --> 01:09.000
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MOM AND DAD WILL POP BY,

01:09.000 --> 01:14.033
AND I KINDA DON'T WANT HER
TO MEET THEM UNTIL...EVER.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.100
- NO, NO, NO!
YOU BRING HER OVER

01:17.100 --> 01:19.167
TO MEET MOM AND DAD
RIGHT AWAY!

01:19.167 --> 01:20.633
YOU GOTTA
GET IT OVER WITH QUICK.

01:20.633 --> 01:22.667
IT'S LIKE RIPPIN' OFF
A BAND-AID.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.567
YEAH, YOU LET HER KNOW
WHAT SHE'S IN FOR,

01:24.567 --> 01:26.433
AND IF SHE DOESN'T
RUN AWAY SCREAMIN',

01:26.433 --> 01:28.700
THEN YOU KNOW
YOU GOT A KEEPER.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.833
HAH?

01:29.833 --> 01:31.533
AM I RIGHT, SQUEEZIOLI?

01:31.533 --> 01:35.133
- GO AWAY.

01:35.133 --> 01:36.967
SO ANYWAY,
WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT?

01:36.967 --> 01:38.800
'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS
ARE GOING TO ATLANTIC CITY

01:38.800 --> 01:40.267
WITH LEE AND STAN.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.133
- REALLY? YOU SURE?
- YES, IT WOULD BE PERFECT.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.033
SATURDAY NIGHT,
I'LL MAKE DINNER.

01:44.033 --> 01:46.200
- THAT'S ANOTHER BAND-AID.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.833
- SO, ANGELA, WHAT KIND OF LAW
DO YOU PRACTICE?

01:56.833 --> 02:00.100
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I DEAL MOSTLY
WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.167
- ANGELA SPEAKS
FOUR LANGUAGES.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.333
- WHOA!
- WOW!

02:03.333 --> 02:04.900
- WELL, IT'S NOTHING,
REALLY.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.367
I STUDIED SPANISH AND FRENCH,

02:06.367 --> 02:08.700
AND I SPEAK ITALIAN
BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE ITALIAN.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.533
- OH. HEY, OUR PARENTS
ARE ITALIAN.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.133
YOU SHOULD
MEET THEM SOMETIME.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.267
- DEBRA, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

02:17.267 --> 02:20.600
YOUR LEMON CHICKEN
IS DELICIOUS.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.600
- OH, THANKS.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.400
I LIKE YOU.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.067
- I LIKE YOU TOO.
- OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.300
- SHOULD I GET
SOME DESSERT FOR US?

02:30.300 --> 02:33.233
- YEAH, DESSERT TIME.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:34.700 --> 02:35.867
- OH, GREAT.

02:35.867 --> 02:37.667
HEY, SOMEONE ELSE
LIKES YOUR COOKIN'.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.567
WE GOT A FLY IN HERE.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.100
- OH, UGH, ANGELA, I'M SORRY.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.400
HEY, RAY, COULD YOU CLEAR OFF
THE REST OF THE PLATES, PLEASE?

02:44.400 --> 02:47.233
- OH, I'LL DO IT.
- NO, NO, I'M DOING IT.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.733
I LIKE TO HELP OUT
AROUND THE HOUSE

02:49.733 --> 02:53.267
AS MUCH AS I CAN.

02:53.267 --> 02:56.467
IT'S JUST MY NATURE.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.300
- YEAH,
I'D BETTER HELP OUT TOO,

02:59.300 --> 03:03.800
OR I'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT LATER.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.333
THAT'S HER NATURE.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.467
OH. OH--

03:12.767 --> 03:14.000
HEY, YOU GOT HIM!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.400
- YEAH, I GUESS I DID.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.900
- OH, WOW, GOOD HANDS.
ALL RIGHT, UM--

03:17.900 --> 03:19.500
- OH, IT'S OKAY; I GOT IT.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.533
- OKAY, I'LL PUT THIS DOWN.

03:21.533 --> 03:24.167
- HOW GREAT IS SHE?
SHE'S PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT?

03:24.167 --> 03:25.767
- YEAH, NOT BAD,
BIG TOP.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.800
- ROBERT, I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.033
SHE IS TERRIFIC.
- OH, THANK YOU.

03:30.033 --> 03:32.200
- YOU SEE I MADE HER LAUGH
A COUPLE TIMES?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.100
- YEAH, YOU'RE HILARIOUS.
GO.

04:15.233 --> 04:16.767
- I GOT THE PLATES.

04:16.767 --> 04:18.067
- OKAY, CAN YOU JUST GRAB
THOSE FORKS THERE, ROBERT?

04:18.067 --> 04:20.233
- SURE.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.233
- COME ON, RAY.

04:22.233 --> 04:25.100
BE CAREFUL WHERE
YOU SET THAT COFFEE DOWN.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.633
- I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT ANYMORE.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:31.633 --> 04:32.767
- HELLO.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.400
- HELLO, DEAR.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.200
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOIN' BACK SO SOON?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.500
- YOUR FATHER MADE A SCENE,

04:38.500 --> 04:41.400
AND WE WERE ESCORTED
OUT OF THE CASINO.

04:42.833 --> 04:45.700
- TWO BUCKETS OF NICKELS
AND NOT ONE PAY-OUT.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.167
- THAT'S NO REASON
TO THROW A ROAST BEEF SANDWICH

04:48.167 --> 04:49.667
AT THE MACHINE!

04:53.167 --> 04:56.000
HELLO.
- HI.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.633
- HI. I'M MARIE.

04:57.633 --> 05:01.500
ARE YOU...
A SINGLE FRIEND OF ROBERT'S?

05:01.500 --> 05:03.533
- YES, YES.

05:03.533 --> 05:07.267
ANGELA, THESE ARE
RAY AND DEBRA'S NEIGHBORS...

05:11.600 --> 05:15.000
MOM AND DAD.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.333
- HOW NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YOU TOO.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.733
- OH, I SEE YOU'RE HAVING
A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER.

05:20.733 --> 05:24.233
IF I HAD KNOWN, I WOULD HAVE
NEVER GONE TO ATLANTIC CITY.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.500
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME, RAYMOND?

05:33.733 --> 05:36.567
- YOU KNOW, MOM, IT WAS JUST
KIND OF A LAST-MINUTE THING.

05:36.567 --> 05:37.800
- WHO CARES?

05:37.800 --> 05:40.800
THE POINT IS, WE'RE HERE NOW,
AND I SEE CAKE.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.033
- BE QUIET, FRANK.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.467
COME OVER HERE
AND SIT DOWN, HONEY,

05:43.467 --> 05:45.233
AND TELL ME
ALL ABOUT YOURSELF.

05:45.233 --> 05:48.100
LOOK AT THAT
CUTE LITTLE FIGURE YOU HAVE.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.867
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

05:51.867 --> 05:53.467
MOM CAN SENSE
WHEN I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME,

05:53.467 --> 05:55.300
AND SHE'S HERE TO KILL IT.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.300
- LISTEN, ROBERT,
JUST RELAX; IT'LL BE FINE.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.833
LOOK, IF ANGELA
REALLY IS THE ONE,

05:59.833 --> 06:01.600
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO MEET
YOUR PARENTS AT SOME POINT.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.133
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT OVER WITH.

06:03.133 --> 06:04.767
RIGHT, RAY?

06:09.933 --> 06:12.267
- SHE'S NOT THE ONE.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.167
- WHAT?

06:25.800 --> 06:29.233
- C'MERE. LISTEN. LISTEN.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.767
I SAW SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

06:31.767 --> 06:35.600
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW,
BECAUSE I SAW IT.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.000
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT DID YOU SEE, RAY?

06:39.267 --> 06:41.500
- ANGELA ATE THE FLY.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.967
- WHAT?

06:43.967 --> 06:45.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:45.433 --> 06:49.700
- THE FLY
THAT WAS FLYING AROUND--

06:49.700 --> 06:51.133
ANGELA KILLED IT,

06:51.133 --> 06:53.067
IT FELL ON THE TABLE,

06:53.067 --> 06:54.333
SHE PUT IT IN A NAPKIN,

06:54.333 --> 06:59.033
AND THEN SHE ATE IT!

07:06.500 --> 07:09.533
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, RAY?

07:09.533 --> 07:12.533
- YEAH, MAN,
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.200
- I'M TELLING YOU,
I SAW THAT WOMAN EAT A FLY!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.367
- OH, SHE DID NOT.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.300
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN
SOMETHING ELSE.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.833
- WH-WHAT THEN?
WHAT DID I SEE?

07:18.833 --> 07:21.033
- I DON'T KNOW; MAYBE IT WAS
A CROUTON OR SOMETHING.

07:21.033 --> 07:24.167
- A FLYING CROUTON?

07:24.167 --> 07:26.033
- ARE YOU DRUNK?

07:26.033 --> 07:27.400
- LOOK, I'M TRYING
TO HELP HIM.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.267
- HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO HELP ME, RAYMOND?

07:29.267 --> 07:30.833
- I'M DOING WHAT
ANY BROTHER WOULD DO.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.033
IF YOU SEE DEBRA EAT A FLY,

07:32.033 --> 07:34.567
I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME RIGHT AWAY!

07:36.167 --> 07:38.233
- SHE DID NOT EAT A FLY.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.467
- YES, SHE--
- NO, SHE--

07:39.467 --> 07:46.000
- YEEEEEEES!

07:46.000 --> 07:47.400
- NOW, JUST A SECOND, RAYMOND,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.200
BECAUSE WHAT I THINK
YOU'RE REALLY SAYING IS,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.167
"UH-OH, ROBERT
FOUND SOMEONE SPECIAL,

07:51.167 --> 07:52.400
"SOMEONE WHO'S SO GREAT

07:52.400 --> 07:54.600
THAT SHE ACTUALLY
MAY BE THE ONE."

07:54.600 --> 07:57.633
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH
A SNIVELING LITTLE INSECURE MAN,

07:57.633 --> 07:58.700
YOU'LL DO ANYTHING

07:58.700 --> 08:02.267
TO KEEP ME FROM HAVING
WHAT YOU HAVE.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.700
- SHE ATE A FLY.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.000
- GOOD-BYE, RAYMOND.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.767
- ROBERT!

08:15.767 --> 08:18.333
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.633
- OH, ROBBIE.
SIT DOWN.

08:20.633 --> 08:25.267
WE'RE HAVING SUCH FUN
WITH YOUR SINGLE FRIEND HERE.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.467
- I'D LOVE TO, MA,

08:26.467 --> 08:27.867
BUT I MUST HAVE
LEFT MY PAGER SOMEWHERE,

08:27.867 --> 08:29.800
AND IF THE CAPTAIN
TRIES TO GET AHOLD OF ME,

08:29.800 --> 08:31.267
I COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.367
SO, UH, I'M SORRY, ANGELA,
BUT WE HAVE TO GO.

08:33.367 --> 08:34.867
- OH, SURE.
OF COURSE.

08:34.867 --> 08:38.067
- WE WERE JUST GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.533
- YEAH, ROBERT,
PLEASE STAY.

08:39.533 --> 08:42.100
- I'M SORRY, DEB.
REALLY, THANKS VERY MUCH.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.700
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT--
THAT YOU DID.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.567
- YOU GUYS, THIS WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:48.567 --> 08:51.167
- OH, SURE.
MY PLEASURE.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.067
- THANKS, RAY.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.900
- YEAH, IT WAS NICE.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.500
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.833
YEAH.

08:58.833 --> 08:59.967
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

08:59.967 --> 09:02.033
- THANKS.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.333
- BYE.
- BYE.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.667
TALK TO YOU SOON.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.667
WELL, THEY DID SAY
IT WAS GONNA RAIN.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.467
I THINK WE MADE IT
JUST IN TIME.

09:21.467 --> 09:22.867
HERE, LET ME
TAKE YOUR COAT.

09:22.867 --> 09:24.867
- OH, THANK YOU.
- SURE.

09:24.867 --> 09:27.600
WOULD YOU, UH,
LIKE A DRINK?

09:27.600 --> 09:30.033
- NO, THANKS.
I'M FINE NOW.

09:30.033 --> 09:31.700
IT'S A NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.067
- OH, THANKS.

09:33.067 --> 09:34.533
WELL, COME HERE.
SIT DOWN.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.433
WAS, UM, SOMETHING
BOTHERING YOU TONIGHT, ROBERT?

09:37.433 --> 09:39.533
- NAH, IT'S NOTHIN',
JUST MY BROTHER.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.233
- YOUR BROTHER?
HE SEEMED SO SWEET.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.600
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.067
MY BROTHER HAS
A LOT OF ISSUES.

09:45.067 --> 09:47.100
LET'S JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.033
- DID HE...DO SOMETHING?

09:50.033 --> 09:52.700
- NAH, HE'S JUST CRAZY.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

09:58.433 --> 10:00.467
I THINK THAT
YOUR BROTHER

10:00.467 --> 10:03.533
MAY BE A LITTLE
JEALOUS OF YOU.

10:03.533 --> 10:04.967
- WHAT?

10:04.967 --> 10:06.767
- WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS.

10:06.767 --> 10:10.200
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE TALL,
FUNNY, HEROIC,

10:10.200 --> 10:13.033
GOOD-LOOKING ONE.

10:15.733 --> 10:21.067
- ACTUALLY, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A LITTLE JEALOUS OF ME.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.800
- WHO WOULDN'T BE?

10:22.800 --> 10:28.200
- AND IT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED HIM
THAT OUR MOTHER PREFERS ME.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.867
- WHO WOULDN'T PREFER YOU?

10:30.867 --> 10:33.900
- I REALLY LIKE YOU.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.733
- I REALLY
LIKE YOU.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.767
- YOU KNOW, HE ONCE
SOLD MY BICYCLE

10:38.767 --> 10:41.333
TO ANOTHER KID.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.867
- ROBERT?
- YES?

10:43.867 --> 10:46.267
- COULD WE KISS NOW?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.000
YOU OKAY?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.133
- OH, I'M VERY OKAY.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.400
- WANT TO BE MORE OKAY?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.633
- OKAY.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.700
- WANT TO GO IN THERE?

11:21.700 --> 11:23.400
- OKAY.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.100
- I'LL BE IN IN A MINUTE.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.900
- AND I'LL BE IN THERE...

11:31.900 --> 11:35.100
BEING VERY OKAY.

11:44.733 --> 11:47.700
[thunder crashes]

12:10.067 --> 12:11.400
[croaks]

12:21.367 --> 12:23.233
- I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.733
[crickets chirp,
frogs croak]

12:37.800 --> 12:41.267
[thunder crashes]

13:09.800 --> 13:11.167
ROBERT?

13:12.067 --> 13:15.767
- OH! HELLO!

13:15.767 --> 13:16.900
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:16.900 --> 13:19.033
- I'M...

13:19.033 --> 13:21.800
SEEING IF
IT'S STILL RAINING.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.300
- I THINK IT IS.

13:23.300 --> 13:27.333
- [laughs]
I THINK IT IS TOO.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.967
- YOU'RE GOING OUT THE WINDOW.

13:30.967 --> 13:33.667
- YES, YES, I AM...

13:33.667 --> 13:40.467
BECAUSE MY CAR
HAS MY PONCHO IN IT.

13:40.467 --> 13:46.700
SO I'M GONNA GO GET
MY TRUSTY PONCHO...

13:48.333 --> 13:51.900
AND THEN I'M GONNA GO
GET SOME ICE CREAM FOR US.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.600
YOU LIKE ICE CREAM?

13:54.600 --> 13:58.000
I DO.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.933
I LIKE IT
WITH CHOCOLATE CHIPS

13:59.933 --> 14:01.700
OR NUTS

14:01.700 --> 14:03.700
AND SPRINKLES...

14:09.800 --> 14:11.267
AND ACTUALLY,

14:11.267 --> 14:15.400
SOMEONE TOLD ME YOU MIGHT PREFER
A DIFFERENT TOPPING.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.267
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT,

14:24.267 --> 14:28.133
WE ALL COME FROM FROGS.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.567
- AHH.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.733
INTERESTING.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.567
GOOD NIGHT.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.567
- OH, ROBBIE!

15:02.567 --> 15:04.533
- HELLO.

15:04.533 --> 15:07.200
- LOOK AT YOU.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.567
- WHAT, IS IT RAINING?

15:12.567 --> 15:17.133
- NO, RAYMOND.
I'M A PEARL DIVER.

15:18.867 --> 15:22.667
- ROBERT, WHAT HAPPENED?

15:22.667 --> 15:24.600
- WELL...

15:24.600 --> 15:26.867
RAYMOND WAS RIGHT.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.600
- HUH! HA!

15:34.067 --> 15:35.667
- WHAT?

15:35.667 --> 15:38.233
- RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?
- THE GIRL.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.400
- IF HE SAID SHE HAD
A NICE UPSTAIRS

15:40.400 --> 15:44.167
AND AN AMPLE DOWNSTAIRS,
THEN I AGREE.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.133
- WHAT ABOUT ANGELA, ROBBIE?

15:47.133 --> 15:50.033
SHE SEEMED SO GENUINE
AND SO REFINED.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.300
WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.033
- FORGET IT, MA.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

15:56.033 --> 15:57.767
- OHH, NO.

15:57.767 --> 15:59.567
WHAT DID YOU DO?

16:02.333 --> 16:07.233
- WHAT HAPPENED, ROBERT?
SHE EAT ANOTHER ONE?

16:09.967 --> 16:11.933
- WHAT?
EAT ANOTHER WHAT?

16:11.933 --> 16:14.700
- YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW, MA.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.100
- YOU TELL ME RIGHT THIS MINUTE,
YOUNG MAN.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.033
- ALL RIGHT, MA, FINE.

16:19.033 --> 16:21.167
SHE EATS BUGS.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.033
- COME AGAIN?

16:24.033 --> 16:26.467
- COME ON, ROBERT,
SHE DOES NOT.

16:26.467 --> 16:27.933
- OH, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU

16:27.933 --> 16:29.467
THAT YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU?

16:29.467 --> 16:31.533
SHE SAT RIGHT THERE
AT YOUR DINNER TABLE

16:31.533 --> 16:34.267
AND ATE A FLY!

16:34.267 --> 16:37.633
- I COULD BELIEVE THAT.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.900
- NO, MOM,
IT WASN'T IN THE FOOD.

16:45.900 --> 16:51.167
- OH. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.300
- WELL, YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, MA.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.800
IT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.200
I FINALLY MEET A GIRL

16:56.200 --> 16:58.133
WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.

16:58.133 --> 17:03.367
SHE'S THE FROG WOMAN
OF MASSAPEQUA.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.167
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS FLIES.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.767
- SHE KEEPS FROGS,

17:06.767 --> 17:08.867
THOUSANDS OF FROGS
ALL OVER HER APARTMENT,

17:08.867 --> 17:10.900
AND SHE FEEDS THEM FLIES,
I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW.

17:10.900 --> 17:16.333
SHE'S A FREAKIN' SIDE SHOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

17:16.333 --> 17:18.833
- I DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD OF THAT, ROBBIE.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.367
SHE HAD SUCH NICE SHOES.

17:22.367 --> 17:26.367
- I HAD TO GO OUT THE WINDOW.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.400
- DID SHE TRY TO STOP YOU
WITH HER TONGUE?

17:33.233 --> 17:34.900
- IT'S NOT FUNNY, RAYMOND.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.733
- HEH HEH HEH HEH!

17:36.733 --> 17:38.500
THHHP!

17:41.900 --> 17:43.267
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:43.267 --> 17:46.133
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT,
'CAUSE I'M DONE.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.133
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE DONE?

17:47.133 --> 17:48.133
- I'M DONE.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.300
I'M DONE DATING.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.733
I'M DONE TRYING
TO MEET SOMEONE.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.233
I'M DONE WITH HUMILIATION;
I CAN'T ANYMORE.

17:53.233 --> 17:56.400
- THERE'S NOTHING HUMILIATIN'
ABOUT GOING OUT THE WINDOW.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.867
IF YOUR MOTHER'S APARTMENT
HAD BEEN ONE FLOOR LOWER,

17:58.867 --> 18:02.300
WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

18:08.133 --> 18:10.033
- JUST STOP IT, FRANK.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.333
ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.
NOW, LOOK,

18:11.333 --> 18:12.967
I KNOW THAT
IT'S TOUGH OUT THERE,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.267
BUT YOU WILL FIND SOMEONE.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.800
YOU HAVE SO MUCH
GOING FOR YOU.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.833
YOU'RE KIND, YOU'RE SENSITIVE,
YOU'RE HONEST--

18:19.833 --> 18:20.833
- BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

18:20.833 --> 18:22.733
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.100
- GOOD LUCK
WITH THE FROG LADY.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.267
- ROBBIE, HONEY,

18:35.267 --> 18:38.300
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

18:38.300 --> 18:39.833
AND I CAN HELP YOU.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.200
I JUST WANT YOU, ONCE
AND FOR ALL, TO SAY IT TO ME.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.500
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SAY WHAT TO YOU?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.567
- THAT YOU'RE HOMOSEXUAL.
- MA!

18:48.567 --> 18:51.667
- JUST SAY IT!
- NO, DON'T SAY IT!

18:51.667 --> 18:53.800
- I'M NOT SAYING IT!
THIS AGAIN?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.033
- A WOMAN ATE A FLY?

18:55.033 --> 18:56.433
NOBODY BELIEVES
YOUR STORIES, ROBBIE.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.167
JUST SAY IT.
- NO!

18:58.167 --> 19:00.733
- "I'M A GAY."
- WHAT?

19:00.733 --> 19:02.167
- YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

19:02.167 --> 19:05.767
"HELLO, I'M QUEER,
AND NOW I'M HERE!"

19:09.600 --> 19:10.400
- WHO SAYS THAT?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.633
- THAT'S THE SLOGAN.

19:12.633 --> 19:14.400
JUST ADMIT IT, ALREADY!

19:14.400 --> 19:15.867
- NO! WOULD YOU STOP?

19:15.867 --> 19:17.400
- WELL, THEN,
WHAT IS IT?

19:17.400 --> 19:19.467
BECAUSE I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.600
YOU'RE TORTURING ME.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

19:21.600 --> 19:25.200
YOU ARE INTO YOUR 40s,
AND STILL YOU CAN'T SETTLE DOWN.

19:25.200 --> 19:29.300
I STAY UP NIGHTS
TOSSING AND TURNING IN MY BED

19:29.300 --> 19:31.333
BECAUSE I'M SO SICK ABOUT IT.

19:31.333 --> 19:34.833
I JUST WANT YOU TO BE
WITH SOMEONE, ANYONE.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.833
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.

19:36.833 --> 19:41.700
I MEAN, FOR GOD'S SAKES,
DO YOU WANT TO DIE ALONE?

19:41.700 --> 19:43.133
- YES!

19:52.733 --> 19:55.500
OH, HIM.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.200
- MA, I SAW THAT GIRL
EAT A FLY!

20:00.200 --> 20:01.833
- STOP IT, RAYMOND!

20:01.833 --> 20:05.900
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT
THAT YOUR BROTHER IS DIFFERENT?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.567
I ACCEPT YOU, ROBBIE.

20:11.733 --> 20:13.333
- LISTEN, MA,

20:13.333 --> 20:17.500
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE
THAN TO TELL YOU I'M GAY.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.000
- MARIE, LOOK WHAT
YOU'RE DOING!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.433
- BUT I'M NOT, DAD, ALL RIGHT?

20:22.433 --> 20:25.900
SO YOU CAN UNCLENCH
YOUR INTESTINES.

20:25.900 --> 20:29.900
I WISH I HAD A GOOD REASON
WHY I'M ALWAYS STRIKING OUT.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.667
BUT I DON'T.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.633
IT'S ME...

20:34.633 --> 20:36.467
IT'S ME.

20:38.633 --> 20:40.733
MOST PEOPLE
FIND THEIR OTHER HALF.

20:40.733 --> 20:43.467
AND I JUST HAVE TO
WAKE UP AND ACCEPT ALREADY

20:43.467 --> 20:47.733
THAT MAYBE THERE IS
NO OTHER HALF...

20:47.733 --> 20:50.067
FOR THIS.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.567
- OH, ROBBIE!

20:56.567 --> 20:58.467
- SEE YA LATER.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.633
- ROBERT, PLEASE.
- COME ON, MAN.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.500
- HEY, SON--

21:07.700 --> 21:10.667
[patrons talking]

21:15.333 --> 21:17.300
- HEY, RICK.
SCOTCH ROCKS.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.500
- COMIN' UP.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.467
LOT OF FRESH FACES
HERE TONIGHT, BIG MAN.

21:22.467 --> 21:25.000
I'LL JUST TAKE THE DRINK.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.767
- I'M SORRY; YOU OKAY?
