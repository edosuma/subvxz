00:01.067 --> 00:02.434
Come to Papa.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.775
Where are you?
Where are you?

00:13.947 --> 00:15.714
150 bucks well spent!

00:16.917 --> 00:18.050
Cash, there's nothing in there.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.153
Nothing in here?
This is Sue Storm. Hello!

00:21.155 --> 00:23.455
Fantastic Four?
The Invisible Woman?

00:23.457 --> 00:26.525
You paid $150
for a box of air?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.293
I know, right?
Half price.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.397
What do you even do
with it?

00:31.531 --> 00:32.398
That.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.265
Dude, where does it end?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.868
There's always gonna be
something bigger, better, geekier.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.871
You're buying something else
right now, aren't you?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.039
Uh, not buying.
Bidding.

00:40.041 --> 00:44.510
Behold. The limited edition
Marty Mcfly self-lacing sneakers

00:44.512 --> 00:46.345
from
<i>Back to the Future II.</i>

00:46.347 --> 00:47.346
Aside from
owning a DeLorean

00:47.348 --> 00:50.549
or kidnapping Michael J. Fox,
there's no bigger collectible

00:50.551 --> 00:52.284
for the  <i>B to the F</i>
<i>enthusiast.</i>

00:52.286 --> 00:55.254
You're bidding
on $300 sneakers?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.856
I wish. $3,000.

00:57.858 --> 00:58.891
What?

00:58.893 --> 01:03.295
Damn! Biff1985
just raised it $500.

01:03.297 --> 01:03.929
Okay, it's go time.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.964
No, no. It's stop time.
Stop. Stop.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.166
You live
with your mom, okay?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.401
You can't even afford
to supersize at lunch.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.237
This is not...
I... I can't watch this.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.073
Don't listen to him,
Red Hulk.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.175
He doesn't understand us.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.710
What? $4,000?

01:18.712 --> 01:20.846
No, I really shouldn't.
I just...

01:20.848 --> 01:23.649
Oops.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.586
Armor Safe Transpo.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.089
They own half the armored trucks
in California.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.490
They want to upgrade
their fleet.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.825
We're gonna go in
fast and furious,

01:32.827 --> 01:34.193
and we are gonna
win this job.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.394
"No" is not an option.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.595
All right.
Just so you know,

01:36.597 --> 01:38.764
I'm going commando down here,
so if you need me to pull

01:38.766 --> 01:40.999
a Sharon Stone,
just give me the nod.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.070
Um, uh, should we establish a bit of,
uh, a game plan

01:45.072 --> 01:47.406
for the presentation?
Who speaks first?

01:47.408 --> 01:50.109
I know a bit of, uh,
an icebreaking joke.

01:50.111 --> 01:50.943
Do you?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.111
Oh, God, no.
No jokes are necessary.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.913
I've already laid the groundwork
with Alonso.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.014
All we're here to do is
sign the papers

01:56.016 --> 01:57.983
- and collect a large check.
- Got it?

01:57.985 --> 02:01.453
Oh, you cocky bastard.
Let's close this!

02:01.455 --> 02:05.224
Great idea. Let's keep
everything closed.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.024
Shaw.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.260
Oz. My brotha.

02:08.262 --> 02:11.396
Looking good
for your age.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.599
'Sup, ladies? Henry Shaw.
Double Dragon Security.

02:13.601 --> 02:16.168
Looks like we're going
for the same client, huh?

02:16.170 --> 02:19.471
Sucks for you, 'cause this young stud
just took your job.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.006
If I were you, I'd buy a new
trapper keeper,

02:21.008 --> 02:23.142
slip your compass
and protractor inside,

02:23.144 --> 02:24.009
and don't be late
for the bus,

02:24.011 --> 02:26.011
'cause you just
got schooled.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.346
Am I a pimp or what?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.413
Fly's open, baby.

02:28.415 --> 02:31.950
Must be real dark times
for you, huh, Ferris?

02:31.952 --> 02:32.484
Mmm.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.521
Yeah.
Oz's first name is Ferris.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.323
Kinda kills the illusion,
doesn't it?

02:38.925 --> 02:41.393
Son of a fricken-fracken...

02:41.395 --> 02:42.027
Son of your frism!

02:42.029 --> 02:46.565
Uh-oh. Oz is fricken-fracken.
What is going on?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.433
Well, we lost the job.

02:48.435 --> 02:52.638
Yeah, we got snaked by some power tool
named Shaw.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.741
He who must not
be named!

02:55.743 --> 02:58.277
You saw
he who must not be named?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.111
Who the hell is Shaw?

02:59.113 --> 03:01.813
He who must not be named?

03:01.815 --> 03:04.683
Oh, man. This is heavy.
What did Oz do to him?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.218
He... He didn't do anything.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.954
Little bastard.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.055
What... What's happening?

03:10.057 --> 03:12.457
I'll tell you
what's happening.

03:12.459 --> 03:16.695
I am getting ready
to rock your world.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.332
Okay, listen, we're not supposed
to talk about him,

03:20.334 --> 03:23.635
but Shaw used to be
our star hacker.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.205
He and Oz were very close.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.780
Whoa. Looks like you guys
were pretty close, too.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.515
They used to give each other
back rubs in public.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.450
It was
a little extremely gay.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.219
Man, it was
over the shirt.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.322
Anyways, then came
the great betrayal...

03:43.324 --> 03:45.691
Shaw secretly opened
his own company,

03:45.693 --> 03:47.960
and he stole
all of Contra's files.

03:47.962 --> 03:50.829
Friendship, betrayal,
sabotage...

03:50.831 --> 03:54.600
I know just
what this man needs.

03:54.701 --> 03:58.203
Come on. Take the hug.
Now talk to me.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.571
Fine! You want me to talk?

03:59.573 --> 04:03.041
I hate
that little pimple.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.776
You see
that sword up there?

04:04.778 --> 04:05.911
Uh-uh.
Exactly.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.145
The sword
that should be there

04:07.147 --> 04:09.414
belonged to my father
and his father before him,

04:09.416 --> 04:12.150
who stole it off a wall
of a
sushi restaurant in Oakland.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.653
<i>It meant the world to me,</i>
<i>which is why I gave it</i>

04:14.655 --> 04:17.055
<i>to my friend and protege</i>
<i>Henry Shaw...</i>

04:17.057 --> 04:18.123
Oh!

04:18.125 --> 04:19.358
Man, that is so sharp!

04:19.360 --> 04:20.892
Let me see. How could you
not warn me?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.328
Then he used it
to stab me in the back,

04:23.330 --> 04:27.165
right about where your bony chin
is sticking in.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.700
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.837
I didn't know that, Oswald.
Well, from here on out,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.606
we avoid that little dickweed
at all costs.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.142
No. No, that's not how
I do things, V.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.678
I admit, Shaw did take me
off my game,

04:39.680 --> 04:42.114
but the Oz-Man is back
in charge.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.116
Next time,
I'll be ready for him.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.184
Attaboy, Ferris.

04:46.619 --> 04:50.489
Thrilled to see you
glommed on to that one, V.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.026
Okay. It's you
and me, Biff.

04:54.028 --> 04:54.893
One more minute to go,

04:54.895 --> 04:57.863
and those kicks
of the future are mine.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.334
What? Cats?
Oh, man. Aw.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.402
Sorry, pal.
Couldn't let you do it,

05:03.404 --> 05:04.469
so I hijacked
your browser.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.871
Dude, I know you're
my best friend,

05:05.873 --> 05:07.806
but I will
physically fight you.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.174
I think I'll be fine.

05:09.176 --> 05:09.941
You're right.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.911
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.047
Thanks for the lookout.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.216
Won it!

05:18.218 --> 05:20.085
You spent $6,000?

05:20.087 --> 05:21.186
Dude, you made me panic,

05:21.188 --> 05:22.220
so I hit
the "buy it now" button.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.790
What?
Oh, so this is my fault?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.358
Ow! Are you out
of your mind?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.392
You don't have six grand!

05:27.394 --> 05:29.795
Dude, you hit me
in my allergy shot,

05:29.797 --> 05:32.631
and I may not have six grand,
but you know what I do have?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.000
I have 169 IQ
I'm Mensa, bitch!

05:35.002 --> 05:39.838
I got revenue streams coming in
that you can't even comprehend!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.273
Okay.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.408
Let's do this.

05:43.843 --> 05:44.509
The cinnamon challenge.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.946
I saw a guy do this online,
and he went into shock.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.982
Here we go.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.751
Whoa.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.353
Mmm.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.790
Sorry.
No swallow, no money.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.258
Yeah!

06:00.260 --> 06:01.860
I'm so boned.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.311
<i>♪ Oh</i>

06:19.313 --> 06:21.646
<i>♪ We got your back</i>

06:28.788 --> 06:32.624
Erasing all my stuff?
That's not even a thing.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.126
Shaw-zam!

06:34.128 --> 06:35.727
You'd better soak
some soft gauze

06:35.729 --> 06:36.928
in aloe vera
and have a nurse apply it

06:36.930 --> 06:40.866
in a layered fashion, 'cause you just
got burned!

06:40.868 --> 06:42.634
Fly's open, dude.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.635
Whatever.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.271
Cage may be open, but the beast
is still asleep.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.107
Ah, lovely.
It seems I have a visitor.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.976
Carol, handcuffs!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.879
Don't want to go to jail
for nerdicide.

06:53.881 --> 06:56.648
I didn't come here
to fight you, Ferry.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.583
I actually came here
to reconnect.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.686
An old friend of yours
wants to say hello.

07:02.021 --> 07:03.855
It's your sword.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.390
We're very close.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.092
Here's me and swordy
in Maui

07:07.094 --> 07:09.895
and me and swordy getting
a lap dance.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.997
Oh, me and swordy making
a chopped salad.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.432
Well, don't worry. I didn't dull him
or anything,

07:13.434 --> 07:17.369
'cause actually I also still use him to
do a little manscaping.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.171
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.673
Damn my escape training!
Aah!

07:21.675 --> 07:23.041
Wait, wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Aah!

07:25.779 --> 07:26.344
Let's reboot this.

07:26.346 --> 07:30.582
Listen, when I totally skunked you
on that armored car job,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.384
I realized...

07:32.386 --> 07:33.452
I want all your jobs,

07:33.454 --> 07:36.855
so what do you say you and I make
a little wager...

07:36.857 --> 07:38.323
My client list
for yours?

07:38.325 --> 07:40.058
You know I won't do that.

07:40.060 --> 07:44.463
Come on. It's just one teensy-weensy
little bet.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.597
It'll be just like
the old days.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.467
You can pick the game.
Poker, high card.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.502
Hell, I'll even arm wrestle
you for it.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.436
It's not gonna
happen, Shaw.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.238
What? Why?
Just rip his arm off.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.273
Look at them.
They're like straws.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.012
Hey! Hey!

08:01.014 --> 08:03.114
No can do-ey.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.282
I knew it.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.317
Looks like you're gonna
have to head down

08:05.319 --> 08:08.153
to your local one-hour photo shop
and ask 'em to leave

08:08.155 --> 08:09.988
the negatives
of your vacation pics

08:09.990 --> 08:12.157
in the developing fluid
a little longer,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.926
'cause you've
been exposed!

08:14.928 --> 08:16.328
Unh!

08:17.997 --> 08:19.231
Leave the...
The... The exp...

08:19.233 --> 08:21.132
Leave the photos? Photo...
Yeah, 'cause you...

08:21.134 --> 08:23.535
You leave it on too long,
and you expose it.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.570
Oh.
That's what... Yeah.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.739
Oh. Oh.

08:28.475 --> 08:32.277
Thank you, Lord, for bestowing
this gift upon myself.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.259
He spent six grand
on freaking sneakers.

08:47.261 --> 08:51.396
What? Veronica just
lent him $6,000.

08:51.398 --> 08:51.997
Wait. What?

08:51.999 --> 08:53.899
That fraudster gave us

08:53.901 --> 08:57.536
a heartbreaking sob story
about his 500-pound mother

08:57.538 --> 09:00.238
and how she's trapped on the
first floor of their house.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.208
That's why I need the money,

09:03.210 --> 09:05.510
to get one of those
electric cable cars...

09:05.512 --> 09:08.446
That bring her
up and down the stairs.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.415
I am writing you a check
right now,

09:10.417 --> 09:13.985
and I want you to buy
your poor, sweet mother...

09:13.987 --> 09:14.719
The strongest,

09:14.721 --> 09:19.658
most load-bearing fatty stair gondola...
on the market today.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.593
Come here.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.696
Will this check
clear today?

09:24.698 --> 09:25.864
Oh, man.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.133
I really need to
help this guy.

09:33.139 --> 09:33.872
Now what are you doing?

09:33.874 --> 09:36.241
Dude, I had to put 'em on.
I just had to,

09:36.243 --> 09:39.110
but once you get a scuff mark
or human oils on 'em,

09:39.112 --> 09:39.878
they just
become sneakers.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.747
So listen, Veronica wants us
all in the conference room.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.283
No sweat. Ah.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.622
You'll get used to it.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.658
'Sup? 'Sup?
'Suppers?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.894
Ah. Let's do this.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.830
Actually, this meeting is
kind of about you.

09:58.832 --> 10:02.334
We're here to talk
about your problem.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.902
What problem?

10:03.904 --> 10:07.339
You buy useless crap
you can't afford.

10:07.873 --> 10:08.640
Oh.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.909
You bought
a life-sized Tauntaun?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.510
Is that necessary?

10:12.512 --> 10:13.144
Yes.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.680
Oh, my God.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.515
We're having
a nerdervention.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.483
Nerdervention?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.385
Mm-hmm. Yes.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.219
This is bull.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.287
Look,
you're in safe hands.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.123
Veronica here has been intervened
against a number of times.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.360
It's true,
for men and the wacky weed.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.127
Look, I don't care.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.130
This is racist. I don't know how yet,
but it is.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.666
Man, it's not racist.
You're a straight-up nerd,

10:34.668 --> 10:36.701
and I don't like
the way you make me feel.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.370
I read Faulkner,
James Joyce,

10:38.372 --> 10:40.805
yet you mock me for not knowing
what a muggle is?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.375
Please. Everyone knows
what a muggle is.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.442
The very fact
that you don't

10:44.444 --> 10:47.545
only proves that you're a muggle...
A giant muggle.

10:47.547 --> 10:51.016
Cash, this is
classic addict behavior.

10:51.018 --> 10:51.683
Lashing out, lying.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.585
You're utterly consumed
with this stuff.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.787
"Utterly consumed"?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.088
Really? How?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.858
The force
is strong with me.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.995
Release the Kraken!

11:04.897 --> 11:07.232
Kiss my converse!

11:07.234 --> 11:09.601
When I say,
"Who's the master?"

11:09.603 --> 11:13.938
You say, "Sho'nuff."

11:14.106 --> 11:16.141
This is bull.
I do not need help.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.778
You sold your own platelets
to buy action figures.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.645
They replenish.

11:20.647 --> 11:24.449
I do not have
a problem.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.517
I can quit anytime
I want to.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.218
As a matter of fact,
that's a good idea.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.054
How about I quit
right now...

11:29.056 --> 11:31.056
This job?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.591
Sit down and listen up.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.561
You want to know why
I'm not going after Shaw?

11:36.563 --> 11:39.431
I'll tell you why.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.299
He's got
something on me...

11:41.301 --> 11:43.435
Something I'm not
particularly proud of.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.570
You're an arms dealer.
You're a government spook.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.538
You killed a hooker
in Vegas.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.307
Get ahold of yourselves, people.
I've got a gambling problem.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.511
Oh, knock it off.
Stop your murmuring.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.213
I'm human.
Well, mostly.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.750
So that's why you were unwilling to
engage in Shaw's wager?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.185
It gets worse.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.954
You all know I gave Shaw
my father's sword.

12:02.956 --> 12:03.788
After he betrayed me,

12:03.790 --> 12:05.490
I couldn't bear the thought
of him having it,

12:05.492 --> 12:09.661
but he knew my weakness,
and he would only bet me for it,

12:09.663 --> 12:10.995
so I went crazy,

12:10.997 --> 12:14.499
totally obsessed and broke
trying to win it back.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.168
That's why
I had to sell Contra.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.105
You lost Contra
over a sword?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.073
Really? Weak sauce.

12:22.075 --> 12:26.811
Yes, it is, Mcfly.
Perhaps you can relate.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.448
I need help.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.156
Okay. This is
where the recovery begins.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.091
I'll be down the hall
with the gamblers.

12:40.093 --> 12:40.959
Don't leave
before the miracle.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.062
All right. Well, guess I'll see you
in an hour.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.632
Actually, I thought maybe I'd stay,
show you some support.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.734
Really?
Yeah. Why not?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.669
Nice.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.607
Hi. I'm Hollywood Director
James Gunn.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.610
Hi, Hollywood Director
James Gunn.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.578
I know what
you guys are thinking.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.080
This guy is crushing it.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.316
He wrote  <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>
<i>and </i> <i>Tromeo and Juliet.</i>

13:05.318 --> 13:05.817
He's a genius.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.585
And that's...
that's very true.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.287
I am, but inside myself,
there's a hole

13:09.289 --> 13:14.759
that I try to fill with zombies and superheroes
and P.G. porn stars.

13:14.761 --> 13:19.264
Dabbling in the dork arts
has led me to a new low.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.799
I can't make love
to a woman

13:20.801 --> 13:22.567
unless I close my eyes
and imagine

13:22.569 --> 13:24.903
Elita One,
the female Transformer.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.371
Elita One's hot.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.507
Okay.
I'll see you in an hour.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.847
Oh. Where in the hell's bells
have you been?

13:35.849 --> 13:36.548
We're at Code Red!

13:36.550 --> 13:38.049
No. Someone found
my plutonium?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.451
No! Look!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.787
We're at war with Shaw
and Double Dragon!

13:42.789 --> 13:45.290
- What?
-   If any of those pigs come in here,

13:45.292 --> 13:49.494
I will execute every mother-humping
last one of them!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.095
Take it down a notch,
honey bunny.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.197
Listen, listen.
What?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.631
Now we're at war
with Double Dragon?

13:53.633 --> 13:54.632
Yeah.
Since when?

13:54.634 --> 13:56.134
Since when? Oh, gosh.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.070
Um, probably
since I went over there

13:59.072 --> 14:02.540
and tried to reason with Shaw.
Don't get mad.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.108
Shh. Let it go.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.376
Let it go.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.411
No, no. You let me go.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.847
Oh, God! Your chin
is like a stiletto!

14:08.849 --> 14:12.217
I gave him the classic back hug
with a full boob press,

14:12.219 --> 14:13.051
just the way you like it,

14:13.053 --> 14:16.654
but, you know, for some reason,
he just was not having me,

14:16.656 --> 14:19.691
so I very, very calmly

14:19.693 --> 14:21.626
left the building, and that's all
that happened.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.362
Double Dragon isn't even
in our league!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.531
Oh, if that's the case,
then maybe you're man enough

14:26.533 --> 14:28.032
to put your money
where your mouth is.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.935
Oh! If you knew what had
been in this mouth,

14:30.937 --> 14:34.472
you would not want
to make that bet.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.642
What did you do?

14:37.644 --> 14:42.180
Oh, um, well, I think
that I may have just

14:42.182 --> 14:47.886
risked the entire future of the company
to defend your honor.

14:47.888 --> 14:48.586
Huh.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.687
So we good?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.222
Since Veronica cockered
the spaniel,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.391
you've got yourselves
a bit of a situation.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.526
The game is
Capture The Flag.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.895
Now the rules
are very simple.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.897
Whoever breaks into
the other's office first

14:58.899 --> 15:01.065
and steals their client list wins it all.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.101
Okay. What's the plan,
hack their system?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.302
Classic penetration.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.570
Go heavy. Go hard.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.237
Backdoor entry!

15:06.239 --> 15:08.273
My God.
I'm really horny.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.643
My plan is to handcuff myself
to this column,

15:11.645 --> 15:12.543
because this
is gambling,

15:12.545 --> 15:13.611
and I'm not allowed
to participate.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.180
What about
your escape training?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.349
Good point. Carol!

15:22.222 --> 15:23.621
Two is my limit.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.990
Okay. You're on your own.

15:25.992 --> 15:26.524
Cameron!

15:26.526 --> 15:27.825
Cameron.
Cameron. Cameron. Cameron.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.628
All right, look, Shaw is
a master manipulator

15:30.630 --> 15:32.964
and a genius at exploiting
his enemies' weaknesses.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.033
Copy that.
Make me proud, kid.

15:35.035 --> 15:39.137
Damn! I'm just too good!
It's annoying, really.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.572
<i>Okay. We're striking first.</i>

15:41.574 --> 15:43.541
<i>I just saw Shaw and the double</i>
<i>douches leave.</i>

15:43.543 --> 15:45.710
<i>Okay. Okay, I'm in.</i>
<i>I hacked their alarm system,</i>

15:45.712 --> 15:48.713
<i>and I looped their surveil cameras</i>
<i>so I'm a ghost.</i>

15:48.715 --> 15:49.280
Okay, Casper.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.950
Just grab the client list
and go to the light.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.117
<i>Wait. There it is.</i>

15:53.119 --> 15:55.553
<i>Wait! Wait. Somebody left</i>
<i>their laptop logged in.</i>

15:55.555 --> 15:56.621
<i>Oh, I'm gonna</i>
<i>be able to do</i>

15:56.623 --> 15:58.189
<i>a lot more than</i>
<i>get their client list.</i>

15:58.191 --> 16:01.259
Laptop? Wait. That's too easy.
Cameron, it's a trap!

16:01.261 --> 16:03.428
It's a trap!

16:03.430 --> 16:04.162
Oh!

16:04.164 --> 16:07.298
<i>Yeah, I pieced</i>
<i>that together.</i>

16:10.002 --> 16:11.302
Okay, hold tight, buddy.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.972
- I'm on my way.
- Nothing's gonna stop me.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.508
Sweet silver time machine
of my dreams

16:17.510 --> 16:20.878
in its glorious
stainless steel flesh!

16:21.948 --> 16:22.947
Pretty dope, right?

16:22.949 --> 16:25.049
It's kinda like the car version
of the Holy Grail.

16:25.051 --> 16:28.152
What are you doing here, Shaw?
Hit the road.

16:28.154 --> 16:28.953
Roads?

16:28.955 --> 16:32.256
Where you're going,
you don't need roads.

16:32.624 --> 16:35.059
What are you saying,
this is your car?

16:35.061 --> 16:37.195
Yep. You want it?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.130
Come on.
You know you do.

16:39.132 --> 16:39.964
What's your angle?

16:39.966 --> 16:41.332
Why would you give me
a DeLorean?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.368
Oh. No givesies.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.370
Tradesies. One kindness for another.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.973
Just disable Contra's alarm
by the back door, 8:00 p.m.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.441
He's preying
on your weakness, Cash.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.609
It's just a car.
It's just a car.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.678
It's just a car!

16:53.680 --> 16:56.647
Just a car with the complete
flux capacitor package,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.549
and I may have rigged
the tires

16:58.551 --> 17:00.385
to leave a streak
of flames.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.922
Give me the damn keys.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.361
Yes.

17:12.731 --> 17:13.731
Gull wings, son.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.067
Part of me feels
so good...

17:16.069 --> 17:19.837
But so horrible
for selling out to Shaw!

17:19.839 --> 17:21.906
So good!

17:21.908 --> 17:22.607
Horrible!

17:22.609 --> 17:23.841
Good!

17:23.843 --> 17:25.510
Horrible!

17:25.512 --> 17:26.744
New car?

17:26.746 --> 17:27.678
Uh... What?

17:27.680 --> 17:32.750
No, I'm just holding it for a friend of mine...
M.C. Hammer.

17:32.752 --> 17:37.522
Not the rapper. The other one.
He's an optometrist.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.723
You don't wear glasses.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.260
Uh, thanks
to Dr. Michael Carl Hammer.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.962
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go to a meeting,

17:44.964 --> 17:47.598
before we both
fall off the wagon.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.172
Cash, come quickly.
It's Cameron.

17:57.110 --> 18:02.280
<i>Hey, guys. It's me.</i>
<i>I've, uh, prepared a statement.</i>

18:02.282 --> 18:05.583
<i>Come on. Really? This is</i>
<i>so stupid, all right?</i>

18:05.585 --> 18:06.317
<i>I'm a grown man.</i>

18:06.319 --> 18:08.086
<i>- Say it!</i>
<i>- No!</i>

18:08.088 --> 18:08.853
<i>Aah!</i>

18:08.855 --> 18:11.089
<i>Oh, fine! Fine, fine,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>

18:11.091 --> 18:15.259
<i>I'm not even wearing</i>
<i>goggles, okay? Holy crap!</i>

18:15.261 --> 18:16.227
<i>Aah!</i>

18:16.229 --> 18:17.862
<i>Okay. Okay. All right.</i>
<i>I'll say whatever you want.</i>

18:17.864 --> 18:19.831
<i>Oz is a douche.</i>
<i>Contra sucks.</i>

18:19.833 --> 18:21.799
<i>Just please, whatever,</i>
<i>don't shoot me.</i>

18:21.801 --> 18:23.868
<i>Please don't shoot me.</i>

18:24.838 --> 18:26.571
Oh. We can't beat
these people.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.408
We'll never figure out a way
into the Double Dragon offices.

18:32.344 --> 18:35.947
Yes, we will!
I know a way in.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.683
Let me lay
a little science on you.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.550
This is an infrared scan

18:39.552 --> 18:42.887
of Double Dragon's so-called
"impenetrable" offices.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.288
Oh. Nice work.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.623
Mmm.
Who's Mr. Blinky?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.759
Mr. Blinky is Cameron.
He's the only one there.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.794
And where is
everyone else?

18:49.796 --> 18:52.163
Most likely, headed
over here to break in,

18:52.165 --> 18:53.197
but before they can,
I got a way

18:53.199 --> 18:57.502
to capture the flag and prove to Shaw
I can't be bought.

18:58.504 --> 18:59.737
If my calculations
are correct,

18:59.739 --> 19:02.006
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour,
you're gonna see

19:02.008 --> 19:04.342
some serious
shiitake mushrooms.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.145
Um, I thought
the speed limit was 55.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.746
Oh, gun it!

19:36.276 --> 19:37.441
Whoa.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.377
Great Scott!

19:41.780 --> 19:45.116
What the hell was that?
You dicks almost killed me!

19:45.118 --> 19:45.983
We're here
to rescue you.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.085
What, by running me over
with a DeLorean?

19:48.087 --> 19:51.956
Come on, you dumbass
Marty Mcfly-lookin' idiot!

19:51.958 --> 19:53.624
Get me out of here!

19:53.626 --> 19:54.926
Oh, my God.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.962
I think I might have
found something.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.601
Thank you, Cash.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.538
Aah! Aah. Aah.
Come on. Ear. Ear!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.106
You'd better run
through the casino

20:09.108 --> 20:10.675
straight to the ATM
for more money,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.243
even though there's
a $10 processing fee,

20:12.245 --> 20:14.779
'cause you just drew a 22
at the blackjack table,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.447
and your ass is busted!

20:16.449 --> 20:18.916
Come on.
Who even talks like that?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.586
Ear! Ear! Aah.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.787
Well, hello, little boy.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.556
Did you come
for our client list?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.557
Or did you come
for yours?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.427
Well played, Contra.
You got my client list.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.129
I don't want
your client list, Shaw.

20:32.464 --> 20:33.731
Never did.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.933
Then what do you want?

20:44.143 --> 20:46.077
Thank you, Veronica.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.979
You really had my back.

20:47.981 --> 20:49.880
<i>Do itashimashite.</i>

20:49.882 --> 20:52.817
That means "you're welcome"
in Japanese.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.854
<i>Wakatterutte, Onei-chan.</i>

20:57.656 --> 20:58.122
And you.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.324
You gave up a DeLorean.
I'm proud of you.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.260
That's a big step.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.397
What's going on?

21:06.399 --> 21:09.333
Oh, I'm just selling some of my stuff
to pay Veronica back.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.602
Why don't you just sell
those stupid sneakers?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.570
Oh, I did,

21:12.572 --> 21:14.405
but I could only get
$3,500 for 'em

21:14.407 --> 21:16.774
'cause my feet
deflowered 'em.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.378
But it's kinda cool to let
some of this stuff go.

21:20.380 --> 21:20.978
But a Tauntaun?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.847
I mean, even I can admit
that's pretty cool.

21:22.849 --> 21:26.851
Yeah, but it's a little crazy
owning two of 'em.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.885
Two of 'em?

21:27.887 --> 21:31.589
Oh. Progress,
not perfection, buddy.
