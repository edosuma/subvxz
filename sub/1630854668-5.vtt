00:36.953 --> 00:39.080
<i>There's some things</i>
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

00:41.499 --> 00:43.084
<i>They ain't easy to explain.</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:49.132
<i>I want to say that the choices I made,</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:51.509
<i>I made them for you.</i>

00:53.803 --> 00:54.929
<i>For your mom.</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:57.891
<i>But I don't know if that's true.</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:00.852
<i>Sometimes they went okay.</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.646
<i>Sometimes they went real wrong.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:08.068
<i>And I want to be done with</i>
<i>making those kinds of choices.</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:10.153
<i>But I don't know if I can.</i>

01:11.362 --> 01:12.363
<i>I just don't know.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.492
Old billionaire
is talking to a young banker,

01:15.575 --> 01:18.828
he says, "I was dead broke,
with my last nickel."

01:19.662 --> 01:20.663
"I bought an apple."

01:21.206 --> 01:23.625
"I polished that apple up,
I sold it for a dime."

01:23.792 --> 01:25.251
"Next day I bought two apples."

01:25.335 --> 01:27.337
"I polished both up,
sold them for 20 cents."

01:27.420 --> 01:30.048
Young banker says, "Yeah,
you kept reinvesting, made it big."

01:30.131 --> 01:32.592
He says, "No, my wife's father
choked to death on the apple,

01:32.675 --> 01:33.510
left me a fortune."

01:33.593 --> 01:34.969
Now that's the way you do it.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.304
-Uh…

01:36.387 --> 01:38.473
-Can I get two more?
-Sure thing.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.684
I'm guessing
this is the part of the evening

01:41.768 --> 01:45.355
where you tell me why you're the guy
to manage my investments.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.524
I can think of better ways
to spend our time.

01:55.031 --> 01:55.865
Ooh.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.480
Okay, Mom and Pop,
I brought him home!

02:29.315 --> 02:31.651
This is how you live, baby!

02:32.277 --> 02:33.194
Okay.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.197
Yeah!

02:37.782 --> 02:40.869
Who wants one of my famous martinis?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.287
-Yeah, you can count me in.
-Yeah?

02:58.511 --> 02:59.971
I'm gonna hit the head.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.932
Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.144
I am.

03:06.227 --> 03:09.272
Double. Double. Double! Double!

03:09.355 --> 03:11.191
Ready?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.707
Speed it up. They can hear you.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.375
I'm 30 seconds out of here.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.044
Wait, can you spin it open?

03:31.127 --> 03:32.503
You couldn't keep them out longer?

03:32.587 --> 03:35.673
What kind of asshole has a TL-30
in a fucking closet.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.802
A rich guy. Look at this.
Audemars Piguet. 5K easy.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.137
Just give me a hand here.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.065
Got it. I got it.

03:56.027 --> 03:56.861
What the fuck?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.947
Crowbar. Right here. Just help me out.

03:59.030 --> 03:59.864
Okay.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.366
Okay. Get it in there.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.117
-One, two, three.
-Okay.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.244
Yes.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.789
All right.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.876
Okay.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.050
Yeah, yes!
No, no, no, I'll be right back down.

04:19.133 --> 04:21.219
-Let's go, go!
-Have another drink!

04:22.553 --> 04:24.138
-Hey.
-What are you doing in here?

04:24.222 --> 04:27.183
You must have 100 bathrooms here.
I can't find one.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.937
Let's go check on the ladies.
I see they're warming up on you.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.897
Gonna get a little more comfortable.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.782
You… you should think about Chicago.

04:43.574 --> 04:47.578
You gotta deal with the winters,
but you can make a lot of money here.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.539
No doubt.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.040
Hey.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.002
You got that, uh, that bathroom?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.879
Down the hall and to the left.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.131
-Down the hall?
-Yep.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.008
Which hall? You got so many halls.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.303
-That one.
-That one.

05:06.848 --> 05:11.477
-Hey, hey, hey! Ladies. Here I come.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.069
Hey, Ray.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.946
Yeah, Graham, come on.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.114
Get me out of here!

05:24.449 --> 05:25.742
Fuck!

05:26.701 --> 05:27.618
Wait, wait!

05:30.413 --> 05:31.664
Hold on, hold on.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.749
Hurry!

05:33.624 --> 05:35.752
Okay, it's coming, it's coming.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.427
You okay?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.264
-Jesus.
-You good?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.350
Yeah, I'm good. Go, go, go.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.018
Fucking crazy bastard.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.689
Oh, fuck.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.780
Come on, just eat your victory steak.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.200
Oh, watch the shoulder.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.410
Oh, fuck, you hurt?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.245
Still a bit bruised. I'll be fine.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.080
How much we got, 50?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.457
Seventy.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.376
Maybe 40 to split after the fence.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.002
Plus…

07:02.130 --> 07:02.964
this.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.465
You motherfucker.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.301
"Leave the watch," he says.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.721
I can't have my man
strutting around in a Casio.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.933
Gotta have you looking good
when we pull in a big whale like Max.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.768
You're like a fucking diamond, man.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.396
Put you under pressure
you just come up shining.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.274
If those doors were closed
one-eighth of an inch more,

07:21.774 --> 07:23.401
those bars locked in…

07:23.484 --> 07:25.027
Fucking airtight safe, man.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.114
Imagine me
trying to re-crack the cylinder.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.533
Couldn't open a jar of pickles.
You'd have been fucked.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.749
Not gonna eat that?

07:39.917 --> 07:41.085
Nah, no, it's for you.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.796
Don't mind if I do.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.696
Hey.

08:09.947 --> 08:10.823
Good morning.

08:16.537 --> 08:17.663
How was Chicago?

08:17.747 --> 08:18.956
It was good.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.585
Real good.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.588
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.506
Oh!

08:27.423 --> 08:29.592
-Ray.
-I'm bringing this stuff to Ava later.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.511
I thought I'd save a piece.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.930
Might go really well
with those earrings from Memphis.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.724
Oh, God, it's beautiful.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.727
-Oh, thank you, baby. Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.730
-Whoo!
-Oh!

08:42.813 --> 08:43.773
Whoa!

08:45.107 --> 08:45.942
Good morning.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.362
This little squirrel was up
late last night waiting for her daddy.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.656
Do you want to tell him what happened?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.533
I got my yellow belt.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.534
Wow!

08:54.617 --> 08:57.328
Congratulations. Come on.
Show your old man some moves.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.793
All right, now stand up tall.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.003
Show me some pride.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.505
Eyes straight ahead.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.090
-Focus.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.133
Show me where you're brave.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.221
Show me where you're strong.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.640
Hmm.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.934
Now, give your daddy a hug.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.689
Why don't you two go out for breakfast

09:24.772 --> 09:27.441
and give Mommy some more time
to properly wake up.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.442
All right.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.445
-Love you, baby.
-Love you.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.199
H-A-N-N-A-H.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.953
It works both ways.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.248
Can we play a game?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.875
-Let's see. Seven o'clock.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.503
It's a family.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.048
Mom, son, grandparents.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.801
What's their story?

09:55.344 --> 09:59.682
Grandparents are visiting from… Wisconsin.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.270
They're happy 'cause they don't get to see
their grandson much since the divorce.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.107
-What do you know about divorce?

10:08.190 --> 10:10.067
Sammy's parents got a divorce.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.487
Her mom wanted to get a dog
and then her dad got to get her a dog too.

10:14.238 --> 10:17.241
Grownups let you do anything
after they split up.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.326
Can I have a dog?

10:18.409 --> 10:20.244
I'll feed him
and play with him in the yard.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.080
I don't think
we have the right fence.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.708
So we get a fence!

10:25.791 --> 10:27.752
With flowers on it, so it's pretty.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.714
Get the green.
Then we'll talk.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.549
I like your outfit.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.345
Well, aren't you the sweetest.
Can I get you guys anything else?

10:37.428 --> 10:39.472
I'll take some chocolate pie.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.265
Oh, nice try, kiddo.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.059
-Just the check, please.

10:49.690 --> 10:50.983
I gotta make a call.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.652
Talk to the hand.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.070
Ha!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.295
Everything all right?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.506
<i>Ray, pack your jumpsuits</i>

11:13.589 --> 11:15.299
<i>'cause we're going to Vegas, baby.</i>

11:18.928 --> 11:20.346
Dude, we just got back.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.099
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>It's Comdex at the Sands.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:25.559
<i>These computers</i>
<i>are just like easy fucking cash.</i>

11:25.643 --> 11:27.561
<i>-Hit the strip on the way out.</i>

11:27.645 --> 11:29.355
<i>Double the fucking take. Come on.</i>

11:29.438 --> 11:31.190
Let me finish my breakfast.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.199
I thought we said no pie.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.368
She just gave it to me.

11:44.286 --> 11:48.457
I said, I liked her cat apron
and she asked me if I liked cats

11:48.541 --> 11:50.209
and I said I did,

11:50.292 --> 11:53.212
but it makes me sad
to think about them since the accident.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.297
What accident?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.675
The accident that killed our cat.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.592
Hannah!

11:58.676 --> 12:00.761
I'm a tricky little squirrel, huh?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.783
That flutter kick could use some work.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.744
Why don't you hop in
and show me how it's done.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.746
Grab a towel. I'm on the clock.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.542
Nice.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.469
So what do you think? Forty? Fifty?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.345
I have to talk with Zanetti.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.723
This is more than usual.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.933
Funnel it through the company
like I always do.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.103
The government's
turning up the heat on laundering.

12:51.771 --> 12:56.066
You will need a sub-chapter S,
some LLCs out of Delaware, you know.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.068
Law school's teaching you new tricks.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.363
If you live beneath the waves,
it's good to swim with the fish.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.618
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It sounds better in Spanish.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.787
Anyway.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.874
Let me set you up. Double your take.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.545
I'm taking on enough risk as it is.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.341
I go any bigger, I'm asking to get caught
and I can't do that to my family.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.886
Hey. This was your biggest haul in years.

13:23.969 --> 13:29.767
And after the split
you'll get maybe 20,000? 25?

13:32.102 --> 13:37.274
Most guys I fence for,
they don't have families, lives.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.693
But you,

13:42.238 --> 13:45.115
you need to figure out
what you really want, hmm?

13:45.699 --> 13:46.700
I'll be in touch.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.748
When I told you
that Chicago went real good.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.416
It…

13:56.210 --> 13:57.419
It almost went real bad.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.005
Okay.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.717
Ever since I was Hannah's age,

14:05.177 --> 14:10.558
it feels like I've been hanging on
to the edge of a cliff.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.646
I look at you and Hannah and…

14:16.981 --> 14:21.277
I know it ain't fair
to ask you to hang there with me.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.947
I… I want to get something real
under our feet.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.036
I've been thinking about auto parts.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.080
Now, I know my way around.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.584
I can sell things to people.
Do some repairs on the side.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.919
Starting a business is hard, Ray,

14:39.003 --> 14:41.672
I mean, we… we'd have to tighten the belt.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.549
We don't live large.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.676
And I don't mind smaller if it's better.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.888
I could pick up bookkeeping jobs.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.057
Not so fast.
See, I'm going to need an accountant.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.644
Yeah, like you could afford me.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.354
Oh!

15:03.736 --> 15:05.362
You think you could stop?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.330
Ah!

15:14.413 --> 15:16.206
Who's ready for a good time?

15:16.290 --> 15:19.668
Look at you! It's been so long, huh?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.420
-It has been.
-Hey, hey, hey!

15:21.587 --> 15:22.630
Hey.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.925
Look at Master Chef over here!

15:26.717 --> 15:27.760
Ray's been at it all day.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.763
Courtney, the famous Lily and Ray Vernon.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.599
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you for inviting us.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.768
So you two met at a convention?

15:35.851 --> 15:39.605
Rolling Greens Golf Club.
It's not far from here, actually.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.524
Yeah, Graham was a member.
I was, uh, just working there.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.360
-My parents were members.
-Oh, yeah.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.196
Yeah. My dad worked double shifts
to afford it, but--

15:48.572 --> 15:51.659
We stuck out
like sore thumbs in that place, huh?

15:51.742 --> 15:54.078
Just hiding bread rolls in our pants.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.330
Those rich fuckers staring us down.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.375
This guy was working
one hell of a con from the Pro Shop.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.460
No, it was more like a loophole.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.753
What's a loophole?

16:03.712 --> 16:08.634
Oh, that's a good question.
Let's say your mom, she lays down the law.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.512
She says you can't take any more bread.

16:12.721 --> 16:16.850
A loophole is when you ask me to take it
and then I hand it over to you.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.270
Now, did you break the law?

16:22.272 --> 16:26.694
No. Somebody else took it. I just ate it.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.737
Good girl, that is a loophole.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.738
That's cool.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.949
Yeah, but you still got in trouble.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.742
Eh, that's for the courts to decide.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.036
Is that what you do when you go to work?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.914
No, no. No, no, no, we work with money.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.874
Oh, I set 'em up,
your pop knocks 'em down.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.837
Okay, baby, um, why don't you
go upstairs now and get ready for bed.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.339
I want to hear more about the loophole.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.591
Now. Hmm.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.764
I was thinking
that maybe we should take a break.

16:57.474 --> 17:01.061
I think, after Vegas, what we should do

17:01.145 --> 17:04.982
is just take a couple months out,
slow it down.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.069
Hannah's getting older,
she's becoming aware of things.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.156
And Lily, she's on her own
when we're on the road.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.408
Yeah. No, I hear you.

17:14.491 --> 17:18.454
I think we should just cut back, you know,
take it easy, play it smart.

17:24.960 --> 17:30.299
Yeah, and just, when the time is right,
we strike again, my old friend.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.344
Fuck yeah.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.809
Look, I'm… I'm out, man.

17:42.102 --> 17:45.522
I am done… for good.

17:49.985 --> 17:53.614
-How long you been holding this in?
-We always said it was temporary.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.451
Well, yeah, like 15 years ago.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.204
You said it yourself,
Chicago could've gone sideways.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.414
-You punishing me?
-No, it's not like that.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.666
Chicago's a fluke.
I won't let that happen again.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.418
I can't keep covering your ass.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.046
Covering my ass?

18:10.005 --> 18:13.133
What is that supposed to mean?
I take just as much risk as you.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.885
What do you think happens

18:14.968 --> 18:18.013
when they see a Black man
breaking into a white man's house?

18:20.140 --> 18:22.976
I'm the one
who's jumping out of windows and you,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.937
you get to walk out the front door.

18:57.094 --> 18:57.928
Oh!

19:03.350 --> 19:04.184
Hmm.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.439
-Straight arms, straight arms.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.192
So, you want the good news
or the bad news?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.776
Well, who wants bad news?

19:55.986 --> 19:59.740
So we are only…
six grand short this month.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.117
This bank loan's killing us.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.911
Ray, if we could just refinance--

20:03.994 --> 20:06.580
I put up everything we had
to get the nine-and-a-half,

20:06.747 --> 20:08.832
but they're not giving money
to guys like me.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.834
-We need bodies through the door.
-Hmm.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.628
I gotta run.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
What, you going to the club?

20:15.839 --> 20:19.509
Believe me, I would much rather be here
with you than in that dark cellar.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.178
Come pick me up when you close.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.137
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.222
Okay. You!

20:23.305 --> 20:24.973
-Hmm?
-Watch out for Daddy while I'm gone.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.976
-Can I come? I like the club.
-No, let Mama do her thing.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.562
-Please.
-Uh, yeah, you know what? Yeah.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.773
Yeah, let's get out of the store
for a bit.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.733
-You sure?
-Give you some space, sure.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.778
All right? We'll have fun.
You'll help Mommy, my little helper.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.280
-Yeah.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go. Love you.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.199
-Bye!
-See you, squirrel.

20:52.876 --> 20:53.835
Hello, sir.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.630
I need three copies of my house keys.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.298
Uh, yeah, sure.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.968
How about you come back
in what, uh, 30 minutes?

21:05.305 --> 21:06.556
-Oh!

21:06.640 --> 21:07.474
Shit.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.062
Go on, make yourself a copy.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.731
What? That'd be illegal, wouldn't it?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.443
-How the fuck you doing, baby?
-Good.

21:18.527 --> 21:22.781
I was in the vicinity, thought I'd,
uh, come and check the place out.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.741
-Eight months this Tuesday.
-Yeah.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.163
You fucking did it, man. I'm proud of you.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.125
Doing okay. Got some repeat customers.
Neighborhood's catching on.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.169
-Gotta keep paying the bank, right?
-Yeah, we're doing okay.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.587
You get in that fucker's house,

21:37.671 --> 21:41.341
you could start paying your debt
right quick.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.971
What kind of alarm system
you reckon that guy has?

21:46.054 --> 21:47.931
A guy like that, basic dual trigger.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.517
-You know, central monitoring station.
-Yeah.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.686
You bypass it with a circuit bridge.

21:52.769 --> 21:53.979
Wall safe?

21:54.062 --> 21:56.023
-Floor.
-Yeah.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.357
-Digital dial.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.192
But he keeps the code in his Rolodex.

21:59.985 --> 22:05.991
-Easy money.
-Easy money… 'til it ain't.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.617
Yeah.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.495
So what, you just happen to be
in the neighborhood?

22:12.706 --> 22:15.500
Okay. You got me.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.754
Um, no actually. The truth is, um…

22:22.507 --> 22:24.593
Okay. I'm in trouble.

22:26.011 --> 22:26.845
How bad?

22:26.928 --> 22:29.306
250. Closer to 300 with the--

22:29.389 --> 22:31.558
Shit, who fronted you
that kind of money?

22:31.641 --> 22:35.520
Look, all I need to do
is get my head above water and just…

22:35.604 --> 22:38.607
get some fucking big cash
and I need it fast, you know.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.734
I can't…
You gotta find somebody else.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.736
Oh, I tried. No one can do what you do.

22:44.279 --> 22:49.368
Ray… I… I fucking need you, man.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.801
-Hey, Hannah.
-Hmm?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.261
Baby, could you take that outside?

23:08.887 --> 23:09.846
Okey-dokey.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.426
Mama, I'm in the brig!

24:31.887 --> 24:32.971
Can I help you, sir?

24:33.054 --> 24:35.599
I'm here to see my wife. Lily Vernon.
Works at purchasing.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.393
I'll call over, just one… second. Uh, sir.

24:39.603 --> 24:43.690
Hi, could you let Lily know
that her husband is here?

24:45.233 --> 24:46.067
Thank you.

24:46.151 --> 24:48.653
-Yeah, good, I'm just--
-Feel free to have a seat.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.574
There's cucumber water.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.448
Ow, you're hurting me!

25:33.532 --> 25:35.200
-Hannah?
-Let me go.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.618
Hannah!

25:36.701 --> 25:38.787
Sir. Ex-- Sir!

25:39.621 --> 25:42.082
-Let go of me.
-Could we have security to the lobby?

25:42.165 --> 25:44.626
-Hannah!
-Just get off, you're hurting me!

25:45.210 --> 25:48.088
Wait-- Get your goddamn hands off my kid!

25:48.672 --> 25:50.382
She's breaking into club property.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.051
What is wrong with you?
She's just a child.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.469
This isn't a playground.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.804
There are rules here.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.181
-Look at me, did he hurt you?
-Maybe not in your house.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.225
What? Okay, come on, come on…

26:00.308 --> 26:02.602
Just walk. Let's just get out of here, go.

26:03.728 --> 26:05.230
What, what's going on? Ray?

26:05.313 --> 26:09.192
This is a place of business.
Not some ghetto backyard cookout.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.361
-What the fuck did you say?
-Ray, stop.

26:11.444 --> 26:15.574
-No, you say it again. Say it again!
-Kyle, I'm so sorry, this is my fault.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.659
-How is it your fault?
-I should've been attentive.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.828
-You shouldn't have brought her.
-This is bullshit.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.288
It won't happen again, I promise.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.457
You're right, it won't. Pack your things.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.252
-No, you can't take this out on her!
-No, Kyle! Kyle!

26:30.255 --> 26:32.507
That's it?
You're gonna let him get away with that?

26:40.098 --> 26:41.474
I'm sorry, Daddy.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.105
It's all right, baby.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.442
It's not your fault.

26:50.525 --> 26:53.069
I just wanted to play in the hidey-hole.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.533
Yeah.

27:00.660 --> 27:02.912
Hey, uh,
let's go wait in the car, squirrel.

27:02.996 --> 27:03.913
Okay.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.006
Let's take 'em down.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.931
Christmas Charity Auction.
There'll be security all over the place.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.642
I've been to these things.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.393
They bring in girls to model the jewels

27:25.477 --> 27:27.228
while the husbands
get all tipsy and horny,

27:27.312 --> 27:29.773
-drives the bids up.
-More cover for us.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.067
We need to know
when the jewelry is going to arrive.

27:32.150 --> 27:35.236
We'll find out storage and display areas.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.572
What about entrance and exits?

27:37.656 --> 27:38.823
As usual, you know,

27:38.907 --> 27:42.160
you put on a suit and a smile
and walk through the front door.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.370
And I'll do what I do.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.042
And go. Real gems come out.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.382
Fake gems go in.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.639
And… done.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.140
Seventeen seconds.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.269
Okay. I figure
I have four minutes between rotations

28:08.353 --> 28:09.646
to take out all the gems.

28:09.729 --> 28:13.316
If costume jewelry looks so good,
why waste money on the real thing?

28:13.400 --> 28:17.821
It won't hold up under a loupe,
but it'll last for as long as we need it.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.406
So, what about the Orchid?

28:20.824 --> 28:22.033
It's too hard to fence.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.662
Okay, again.

28:28.665 --> 28:29.582
And Lily?

28:31.960 --> 28:32.961
I'll tell her.

28:36.881 --> 28:38.007
I'll tell her.

28:39.926 --> 28:43.263
I just spent an hour
organizing paint samples.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.265
I think I might be going color blind.

28:46.516 --> 28:50.979
-Hey. You okay?
-Yeah, I was just thinking I--

28:51.062 --> 28:51.896
About money?

28:53.606 --> 28:55.150
-Glen Hills.
-Oh, no!

28:55.233 --> 28:59.863
Nope, they do not get another second
of free rent in our heads, Ray.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.699
-They-- they got this auction--
-Forget about the club!

29:05.285 --> 29:06.786
You're betting on yourself.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.874
And you just gotta trust your instincts.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.251
Hmm?

29:21.426 --> 29:26.014
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

29:26.639 --> 29:29.893
Yeah, I, uh, I gotta take out
that sales rep from Airtex.

29:29.976 --> 29:34.314
See if he'll give me a better price.
You know, I might be home a bit late.

29:34.397 --> 29:37.192
Okay. See you later tonight.

30:18.691 --> 30:19.692
Oh.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.444
Excuse me. Thank you.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.867
I can't believe I'm about to lose.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.412
You made this too hard for Mommy.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.957
It wasn't me. Pepper picked the code.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.917
Oh, oh? Really?

30:37.335 --> 30:41.631
Okay. Let's try this.
This is it. This is it. I feel it.

30:42.465 --> 30:46.177
-You got it wrong.
-Oh, come on.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.137
-Ha-ha!
-To your own mother, Pepper?

30:48.221 --> 30:49.347
No.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.599
You're Pepper's grandma.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.102
-And just like that I'm a grandmother?
-Yep.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.440
Hello?

31:07.448 --> 31:08.867
Um…

31:09.742 --> 31:13.621
Okay. Yeah, I-- I can be there in 45.

31:16.249 --> 31:20.253
Mm, uh, sweetie,
I've got to run to the club.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.963
So I'm going to call Beverley

31:22.046 --> 31:24.257
and see if she can come over
and watch you, okay?

31:24.340 --> 31:25.675
But you got fired.

31:25.758 --> 31:31.347
Yes. And now my boss is calling me back
because he needs my help.

31:32.515 --> 31:35.560
Why don't you stay here
and read until Beverley comes.

31:35.643 --> 31:36.519
-Okay?
-Okay.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.646
-Okay. I love you.
-Love you too.

31:42.942 --> 31:45.111
How's it looking? Busy?

31:46.696 --> 31:49.324
-Wealthy.
-<i>I'm heading there now.</i>

31:55.955 --> 31:56.831
Hey, hey, hey.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.710
Come on, let's keep it moving.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.295
We have 200 covers tonight.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.212
<i>Ándale.</i>

32:14.432 --> 32:15.266
Hi.

32:25.443 --> 32:26.444
Sir.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.864
Uh, no thank… The fuck?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.117
Uh, would you like one of, uh, these?

32:34.661 --> 32:36.245
-Okay.
-Take a napkin.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.530
I'm heading in.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.064
Excuse me.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.818
First one's on the way.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.454
Bogey's on your six.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.251
Clear. Keep a watch.

34:53.549 --> 34:57.386
Jen claims she was in some sort of
fender-bender on tonight of all nights.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.888
I'm not saying she's a liar,

34:58.971 --> 35:01.390
but she's been in
a lot of accidents lately.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.726
Yeah, it's all right,
I'm glad to help out.

35:04.227 --> 35:08.272
I just need someone to reconcile
the… the purchases from the invoices.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.776
The last time we had an auction like this,
it was a paperwork nightmare.

35:11.859 --> 35:15.947
It… It's okay, Kyle, I, um…
You know what, why don't you go

35:16.030 --> 35:19.784
and take care of your guests
and I will handle everything.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.995
-Yes, well… Thank you.
-Okay.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.092
You don't think
it's a little over-the-top?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.429
No! If anything, it's nuanced.

36:21.929 --> 36:23.764
-Nuanced? Thank you.
-Hmm.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.142
-Oh, would you excuse me?
-Sure.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.438
Houseguests in two, Ray.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.526
-You copy? Incoming.
<i>-Can't stop.</i>

36:35.610 --> 36:36.611
Get me more time.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.156
Excuse me, miss. Um…

36:40.239 --> 36:42.325
My mother would very much
like to have a look…

36:42.408 --> 36:44.327
-Sir, please. Step back.
-…at that necklace.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.412
She is very rich.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.081
-Quite drunk.
-Sir, please.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.458
-Okay.
-Thank you.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.087
Ray, get out. Get out now.

37:25.785 --> 37:29.247
Okay. Let's do this one. Here.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.306
-Hey you, don't move! Don't move!
-Wait, wait.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.892
-Stay down. Get down on the ground.
-Okay, hold on.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.062
-Look, this is a misunderstanding!
-What are you doing in here?

37:53.145 --> 37:55.940
-Fellas! What's going on here?
-Please return to the party.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.650
I'm gonna to need some backup--

38:12.957 --> 38:14.583
<i>David, David. Come in.</i>

38:14.667 --> 38:17.295
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.591
<i>David, David. Are you there?</i>

38:23.175 --> 38:25.594
-You all right?
-Let's get the fuck out of here.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.765
-Okay. Get the bag.
-We gotta get out of here.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.850
Yeah, we're going.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.686
We gotta move. We gotta move.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.236
-What are you doing?
-Buying us some time.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.076
-Shit.
-Jesus.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.915
-Jesus Christ!
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:56.792 --> 38:59.128
Get the fuck out. I got this.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.505
Come on, come on!

39:34.455 --> 39:36.374
-Where are you going?
-No, no. She's here.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.751
-Who?
-Lily. I saw her car in the parking lot.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.087
-I thought she got fired.
-She's here somewhere.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.421
I'm going this way.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.131
Shit.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.049
Help.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.802
-Help! Help!
-Lily!

39:47.885 --> 39:48.719
Ray?

39:49.970 --> 39:52.598
-Help! I'm in here!
-Lily!

39:52.681 --> 39:53.516
Fuck!

39:58.020 --> 40:00.022
-Lily! Lily!
-Help me.

40:02.024 --> 40:02.858
Help!

40:03.943 --> 40:04.777
Lily!

40:06.362 --> 40:07.321
Help!

40:07.405 --> 40:10.783
Lily, look at me, look at me.
Move! Move baby, please!

40:10.866 --> 40:17.164
Lily! Lily, Lily, just stay low.
Just stay low. I got you.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.208
Just stay low. I got… Oh, shit!

40:21.544 --> 40:22.795
Graham?

40:22.878 --> 40:26.715
Graham! She's right there!
She's right there!

40:26.799 --> 40:30.010
-Where is she?
-Graham, she's right there, man. Come on.

40:30.094 --> 40:34.056
Graham, you got her.
Graham has got you. He's got you, Lily.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.141
Stay low.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.643
-We hear you.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.853
Help is on the way.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.525
Graham, no! No!

40:49.113 --> 40:51.323
<i>There's some things</i>
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:54.410
<i>They ain't easy to explain.</i>

40:55.369 --> 40:57.288
<i>I want to say that the choices I made…</i>

40:57.371 --> 40:58.205
Lily!

40:58.956 --> 41:02.501
<i>…I made them for you. For your mom.</i>

41:04.837 --> 41:06.505
<i>But I don't know if that's true.</i>

41:10.176 --> 41:12.011
<i>Sometimes they went okay.</i>

41:15.890 --> 41:17.141
<i>Sometimes…</i>

41:17.224 --> 41:18.058
No.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.310
<i>…they went real wrong.</i>

41:19.393 --> 41:20.394
Lily!

41:21.562 --> 41:23.189
Help!

41:26.609 --> 41:28.652
Help!

41:28.736 --> 41:31.739
<i>And I want to be done</i>
<i>making those kinds of choices.</i>

41:32.656 --> 41:34.408
<i>But I don't know if I can.</i>

41:35.743 --> 41:37.119
<i>I just don't know.</i>

41:38.829 --> 41:41.415
<i>Maybe tomorrow it'll all be better.</i>

41:45.878 --> 41:47.880
Is Mama gonna be okay?

41:51.217 --> 41:52.218
I don't know.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.012
When can we see her?

42:03.437 --> 42:04.438
I don't know.

42:16.951 --> 42:19.161
Hi. Can I help you?

42:19.245 --> 42:20.955
This is Detective Tony Barrelli.

42:27.753 --> 42:31.465
Come on, squirrel.
Come on, let me zip you up.

42:37.638 --> 42:38.472
Things…

42:41.225 --> 42:43.185
Things may be different a little while.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.397
What do you mean?

42:50.651 --> 42:55.823
The world may not be as you expect.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.286
People may not do as they should.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.079
But…

43:07.876 --> 43:11.964
I want you to stand up straight

43:12.840 --> 43:15.259
and you, you make it right.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.275
You see that woman down there?

43:33.485 --> 43:34.695
Her name is Ava.

43:35.362 --> 43:36.780
You're going to walk to her.

43:37.364 --> 43:40.492
You're gonna do what she tells you.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.039
And you keep walking.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.794
You don't look back. No matter what.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.549
But… But I want to stay with you.

43:56.383 --> 44:00.137
I know, baby, but I need you
to walk on alone just for a little while.

44:01.138 --> 44:02.097
And be brave?

44:04.224 --> 44:05.059
Yeah.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.895
Remember what we say about being brave?

44:13.067 --> 44:14.485
Show me where you're brave.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.455
Show me where you're strong.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.467
Ray Vernon,
you have the right to remain silent.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.763
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.016
You have the right to an attorney…
