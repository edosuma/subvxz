WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:02.960
So here's what happened
last week.

00:03.045 --> 00:05.963
Will's old rival
tried to cancel the club.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.215
- You're done here.
- Then he was really into it.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.676
I got custom-made
jean jackets.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.135
Then he tried
to cancel it again.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.637
You think you're helping
these kids,

00:12.721 --> 00:14.722
when all you're doing
is setting them up
to be jaded and bitter.

00:14.807 --> 00:18.101
Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad,
which was totally part of Kurt's
plan to get closer to Finn,

00:18.185 --> 00:19.977
who he's always
sorta had a crush on.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.105
When will you learn
that nothing is impossible
when it comes to love?

00:22.189 --> 00:23.815
Artie told Tina
what his greatest dream was,

00:23.899 --> 00:25.817
then realized
that not every dream
is achievable.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.443
Is that even a word—
achievable?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.904
Achievitate? Achievalize?

00:29.988 --> 00:31.364
Okay, you just said,
like, 10 offensive things.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.658
Jesse pushed Rachel
to find out who her mom was,

00:33.742 --> 00:36.119
and it turns out
it's Shelby Corcoran,
the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.329
I want a look
that's so optimistic,
it could cure cancer.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.623
Geez. And that's
what you missed on Glee.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.676
Am I in trouble?
Come on. You've got
more self-esteem than that.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.387
This might have something to do
with your perfect attendance
last semester.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.140
No, Miss Cohen-Chang
is in trouble.

00:57.224 --> 01:01.602
It has come to my attention
that the look you sport
is what is known as goth.

01:01.687 --> 01:06.107
American teens are coming down
with a serious case
of Twilight fever,

01:06.191 --> 01:11.028
transformed from
normal children into vampires
obsessed with the occult.

01:11.113 --> 01:15.783
And only yesterday
this dark specter reared
its head at McKinley High.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.122
This is totally gonna get
Robert Pattinson's attention.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.707
- [Hissing]
- Oh, hey!

01:22.791 --> 01:24.876
- [Growling]
- [Shrieking]

01:24.960 --> 01:27.295
- [Roaring]
- Oh, dear God!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
I don't mean
to state the obvious,

01:30.632 --> 01:33.676
but you do know that
vampires aren't real, right?

01:33.761 --> 01:36.804
- They don't exist?
- William, denial will not
make this problem go away.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.056
My parents won't even
let me watch Twilight.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.142
My mom says she thinks
Kristen Stewart
seems like a bitch.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.813
This is a serious problem.
Miss Cohen-Chang, you've got to
find another style of dress!

01:45.898 --> 01:47.690
Hold on a second.

01:47.775 --> 01:51.527
Tina is shy, and one way
she's found to express herself
is through her clothes.

01:51.612 --> 01:56.115
High school is an incredibly
important time when kids
get to explore who they are.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.452
When I was in high school I had
a whole year where I dressed
exactly like Kurt Cobain.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.538
Come on. There has to be
someone you used to dress like.

02:02.623 --> 02:06.209
Yes, for several years
in my early '20s
I dressed up as Elvis,

02:06.293 --> 02:11.506
but he was a Christian, Will,
and he did not possess the
ability to transform into a bat!

02:12.883 --> 02:15.468
I think he thinks
vampires are real.
I think you're right.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.638
Studies have shown
that a strict dress code...

02:18.722 --> 02:21.641
fosters a safe and stable
learning environment...

02:21.725 --> 02:24.477
with fewer instances
of gang violence
and vampirism.

02:24.561 --> 02:29.524
So if I see you dressed
in lacy demon clothes again,
Tina Cohen-Chang,

02:29.608 --> 02:31.692
you will be suspended!

02:35.113 --> 02:37.782
Step.
One more.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.785
Is there a car down here
for me?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.454
Honey,
we're indoors.
Oh.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.581
And open your eyes!

02:48.418 --> 02:50.461
Sparkling cider?

02:50.546 --> 02:52.129
Yeah.

02:52.214 --> 02:55.842
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?

02:55.926 --> 02:57.844
Burt asked us
to move in with them.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.972
And this is how
you're telling me?

03:01.056 --> 03:04.684
The party was my idea.
If you’re gonna say something,
say it loud, right?

03:04.768 --> 03:08.229
Yeah, it's gonna take
some getting used to,
but you're gonna love it.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.649
Now you don't have to drag
your tail over here every time
you wanna watch the 55-incher.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.986
We got a lot of food.
Some ethnic food. It's some
ethnicity that's not ours.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.531
Look how pretty that is.
Want a crudité?
There you go.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.284
Finn, this house
is twice as big as ours.
It has two bathrooms.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.578
- Two and a half.
- I don't want an extra bathroom.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.664
Or a tuna... crude.
I just want my house back.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.333
I think I know
what this resistance
is about.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.085
Our room.
And I couldn't agree more.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.422
The palette in here
is totally unflattering
to your skin tone.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.841
Not everyone can
pull off Dior gray.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.052
- We need to redecorate.
- Wait. We're sharing a room?

03:40.137 --> 03:43.389
- I'm not cool with that.
- Baby, I know it's weird. Okay?

03:43.473 --> 03:47.101
But it can't be much of
a surprise, and in time you're
gonna be as happy as I am.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.104
Look, I'll knock down
a wall upstairs,
I'll put an addition on.

03:50.188 --> 03:53.316
But until then maybe this'll
grease the wheels a bit? Huh?

03:53.400 --> 03:56.819
Hey, look, there's 300.
Have at it.
You redecorate.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.656
Don't worry, roomie.
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I
will have this all figured out.

04:00.741 --> 04:05.745
I am going to put together a palette
that expresses who you are
and who I want you to be—

04:05.829 --> 04:07.538
who you want to be.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.458
Hey, what night's game night?
You play Sorry?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.584
You know.
You will now.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.003
- Sorry!
- I will— I will beat you.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.339
It's so weird.
This so isn't you.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.424
I feel like
an Asian Branch Davidian.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.177
- Tina, are there any other
looks you can try?
- Biker chick?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.553
- Cowgirl?
- Hood rat.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.639
- Computer programmer.
- Cross-country skier.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.184
- Catholic schoolgirl?
- A Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.896
Look, I appreciate it, guys,
but it just isn't me.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.941
I know who I am,
and I'm not allowed to show it.
It's like communism.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.943
Guys, we have
a serious problem.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.320
I've been doing some deep background
on Vocal Adrenaline.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.740
- Isn't that against the rules?
- No, not at all. Or probably. Whatever.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.910
Anyway, what I figured out,
I rooted through the Dumpsters
behind the Carmel auditorium...

04:45.994 --> 04:49.163
and I found 18 empty boxes
of Christmas lights.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.374
- Oh, no.
- Which led me to Joelle Fabrics.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.710
I asked them about red Chantilly lace,
and they were sold out!

04:54.795 --> 04:56.796
- Oh, sweet Jesus.
- Oh, my.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.631
- W-W-What?
- They're doing Gaga.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.341
- That's it. It's over.
- Exactly!

05:00.425 --> 05:02.635
We should have guessed it.
They're going for full-out theatricality.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.262
They know it's
the easiest way to beat us.
Damn them!

05:05.347 --> 05:08.516
What's up with this Gaga dude?
He just, like, dresses weird, right?
Like Bowie?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.518
- [Sighs]
- Lady Gaga is a woman!

05:10.602 --> 05:13.104
She's only the biggest pop act
to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.147
The most theatrical performer
of our generation.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.149
She changes her look
faster than Britt
changes sexual partners.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.152
- That's true.
- It makes sense that Vocal Adrenaline
would pay homage.

05:20.237 --> 05:23.823
- It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit for them.
- Now, hold on a second.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.034
We might be able
to kill two birds
with one stone here.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.538
We can help Tina find a new look
and find a competitive
number for regionals.

05:30.622 --> 05:34.000
This week, your assignment:
Gaga.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.169
- [All Gasping]
- Pens. Need pens.
My ideas just come to me.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.089
- My office.
- I'm brainstorming.
- Oh, man!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.382
And claw, claw, up, clap-clap!

05:41.466 --> 05:45.344
And five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four—

05:45.470 --> 05:48.389
You think they can see us?
If they catch us, are we
gonna have to go to jail?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.391
Stealing their ideas
is not a crime.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.309
Five, six, seven, eight,
and one—

05:52.394 --> 05:53.728
Your shoes
are making noise.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.813
Five, six, seven, eight.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.483
- And one, two, three, four,
five, six and seven, eight.
- They look amazing.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.194
Claw, claw, up, clap-clap.
And five, six- [Stammers]

06:02.279 --> 06:05.197
Okay, okay, okay.
It's just— Enough.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.367
You guys aren't getting it.
You're letting the costumes
do all the work.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.828
Theatricality
isn't about crazy outfits.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.247
It's not enough to douse
yourselves with gasoline.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.791
You have to light yourselves
on fire to make it work!

06:15.876 --> 06:18.127
God, she's good.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.797
Being theatrical doesn't mean
you have to be a nuclear explosion.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.800
It can be like a quiet storm.

06:24.885 --> 06:30.139
You just have to radiate emotion,
express what's deep inside you.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.435
That's what theatricality
is truly about.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.399

Ms. Corcoran?

09:13.762 --> 09:15.888
I'm Rachel Berry.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.141
I'm your daughter.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.484
Did you ever regret it?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.403
Yes.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.405
Then no.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.658
Then so much.

09:35.742 --> 09:40.120
But when did you realize
it was the right time
for me to find you?

09:40.205 --> 09:43.082
[Chuckles]
I saw you sing
at sectionals.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.750
You were
extraordinary.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.835
You were me.
[Laughs]

09:49.047 --> 09:54.301
Was it hard for you
to not become a star, to not
have your dreams come true?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.931
It felt like
a broken promise.

09:59.015 --> 10:03.102
Like the fisher king's wound-
it never heals.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.313
Wow. Genetics
really are amazing.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.109
You see the world
with the same fierce
theatricality as I do.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.569
Even the way we're sitting
right now is so dramatic,

10:12.654 --> 10:14.571
and yet we feel
so comfortable with it.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.366
I've missed so much.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.750
How do you feel?
Thirsty.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.714
When I was little
and I used to get sad,

10:31.798 --> 10:34.383
my dads would bring me
a glass of water.

10:36.052 --> 10:41.223
It got so I couldn't tell
if I was sad or just thirsty.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.607
Uh...

10:50.692 --> 10:52.735
I shouldn't have done this.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.241
This was supposed to feel good.

10:59.326 --> 11:04.747
W-We were supposed to have
some kind of slow-motion...
run into each other's arms.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.666
- This is all wrong.
- Maybe we can just
g-go to dinner or something?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.752
Just to get over
the initial shock.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.426
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.013
Uh-

11:21.097 --> 11:23.849
I'll- I'll call you.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.948
Oh, hey, Finn. Come on in.
I'm learning all this
amazing stuff about Lady Gaga.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.701
She's got this thing
called the Haus of Gaga,

11:42.786 --> 11:47.456
this collective of artists
and designers who collaborate on
her styles, stage sets, music.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.293
I think it's an exciting model
for what we could be doing in Glee Club.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.464
Yeah, that's kinda what
I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't wanna do Lady Gaga.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.092
And I suspect that,
with the exception of Kurt,

11:58.176 --> 12:01.678
that none of the other guys
are gonna want to do it either.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.099
I just feel like
we're always doing whatever
the girls want us to do.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.268
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.147
You know, maybe I haven't
been listening to you guys
hard enough.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.693
So let's find a solution.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.447
Well, I, uh—
I actually already have one.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.951
[School Bell Rings]
You're wrong. It's a good name.
It's a rock star name.

12:24.035 --> 12:27.246
You want to name our daughter
Jack Daniels? She's a girl!

12:27.330 --> 12:29.164
Okay, fine, whatever.
Jackie Daniels.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.958
The name is not the point!

12:31.042 --> 12:34.503
I told you this.
I'm giving up the baby so I
don't have to do this with you.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505
This is good for you.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.967
Now you can go off
and be a rock star yourself.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.929
I love wearing
champagne bubbles.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.265
I get to express
a whole different side
of myself.

12:46.349 --> 12:50.144
Even though I'm painfully shy
and obsessed with death,
I'm a really effervescent person.

12:52.063 --> 12:55.315
- Excuse me! Were you
dropped on your heads?
- What was that?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.609
I think you heard me.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.028
I'm just saying,
pick on me, that's fine.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.699
- But don't throw around a girl.
- Lately we haven't been able
to tell the difference.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.993
We're not gaga
for Gaga.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.995
You dress
all freaky,

13:08.079 --> 13:10.164

in everybody's faces.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.041
I don't wanna
look at it all day.
It's weird.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.585
Makes my eyes tired.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.504
You wanna switch it up a bit,
just go from Gap
to Banana Republic.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.507
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who we are.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.760
It's the same thing you do
when you go to school
with your football uniforms on.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.971
You're expressing yourself,
and we have every right
to do the same.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.183
Well, the next time
you wanna express yourself
and look like a circus freak,

13:29.267 --> 13:33.479
don't be shocked when my fist
feels like expressing itself
against your chin!

13:33.563 --> 13:37.524
Okay? I'll knock
that crazy-fool crepe-paper
nonsense off you.

some intense news

what'd you find out?

Okay, y'all ready?

14:26.658 --> 14:30.619

she's Rachel's mom.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.663

over to Vocal Adrenaline.

Never. I really don't want
to talk about it though.
I'm still processing the news.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.133
And my dads are moving

later this afternoon.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.303
A-A-All I know is that
I'm not going anywhere...

14:48.388 --> 14:52.599
and I've chosen a Lady Gaga look
that expresses the longing for
a childhood I was deprived of.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.977
You look terrible.
I look awesome.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.021

Whoa! Guys, why are you all
in your theatricality costumes?

40:39.938 --> 40:42.314
It's the end of the week.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.317
We were kind of hoping
to learn what the lesson
of the assignment was.

40:45.401 --> 40:51.198
Well, you guys have had
some great numbers this week,
but I'm not sure I know either.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.700
- [All Laughing]
- I do.

40:53.785 --> 40:57.329
I refuse to dress
like somebody I'm not
to be somebody I'm not.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.874
And I learned it's good
to be a little theatrical.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.878
- [Gasps]
- So here's what's gonna happen.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.214
My dad, he's the king
of the vampires,

41:07.298 --> 41:10.801
and Asian vampires
are the most vicious
of all the vampires.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.803
You're going to let me
wear my lady demon clothes,

41:12.887 --> 41:16.098
or my dad will fly into your bedroom
and bite your face off.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.725
He's really pissed.
Is that what you want?

41:18.810 --> 41:20.853
No, I don't want that,
I'm afraid.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.313
Good.
I'm glad we had this talk.

41:23.398 --> 41:27.151

Fine. You wanna hit me?
You wanna beat me up? Go ahead.

I will never change.

41:43.501 --> 41:47.129
I'm proud to be different.
It's the best thing about me.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.798
So go ahead.
Hit me.

41:49.883 --> 41:52.551
I believe I will.
Sir, would you like
to go first?

41:52.635 --> 41:55.095
You're not hitting anyone.

41:57.682 --> 42:01.059
- Oh, my God.
- Is he wearing a red rubber dress,
or am I trippin'?

42:01.144 --> 42:06.023
I wanna thank you, Kurt.
I realize I still have a lot to learn.

42:06.107 --> 42:11.361
But the reason
I'm here right now
in a shower curtain is...

42:11.446 --> 42:13.739
because of you.

42:13.823 --> 42:17.242
- And I'm not gonna let
anyone lay a hand on you.
- Oh. Really, dude?

42:17.327 --> 42:19.995
'Cause I'm pretty sure
we can take both of you.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.998
Yeah, but can you
take all of us?

42:23.082 --> 42:25.042
Okay.
Okay, I get it.

We are freaks.

But we're all freaks
together,

have to hide it.

Nice job, Finn.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.410
Think you just figured out
what the lesson was.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.746
Kinda makes me wish
I'd planned it.
