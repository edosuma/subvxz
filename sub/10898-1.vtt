00:16.684 --> 00:17.685
[crowd cheering]

00:17.718 --> 00:19.053
[bell dings]

00:19.087 --> 00:20.754
[Man]
Box!

00:20.788 --> 00:23.257
[punches landing]

00:26.260 --> 00:28.829
[thud against canvas]

00:28.862 --> 00:32.133
[bell dings]

00:35.203 --> 00:38.806
[Man]
They say you should never
let go of your dreams.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.342
But if your dream
is to be a Mouseketeer,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.311
and you're 45,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.546
you may wanna
let that one go.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.316
On the other hand,

00:48.349 --> 00:50.218
if your dream's to be
a Wal-Mart greeter,

00:50.251 --> 00:52.086
you can hang on
to that baby

00:52.120 --> 00:54.588
until, like,
a year after you die.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.591
Me, I don't even
know what my dream is.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.328
But it's all right.
I got time.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.430
I won't be turning
40 for another--

01:02.463 --> 01:04.232
[alarm buzzes]

01:04.265 --> 01:06.167
Ugh. I just turned 40.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.435
[glass of water spills]

01:07.468 --> 01:10.471
Jerry, what
are you doing?

01:10.504 --> 01:14.108
Sorry.
Good morning, sweet pea.

01:14.142 --> 01:17.178
No, it's not morning
until the sun's up.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.647
Oh. If you just get
your contractor's license,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.849
you could set your own hours.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.451
Yup.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.671
God damn it.

02:18.906 --> 02:22.610
Oh, that's perfect,
Speed Racer.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.886
[heavy accent]
Happy birthday, Jerry.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.523
Oh, Ozzie.
You shouldn't have, buddy.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.892
What is it?
Is this that Clapton box
set I've been wanting?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.361
Open it, man.
Open it.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.529
It's for you.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.498
Oh, a commuter mug.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.866
Happy birthday, man.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.335
Thanks, buddy.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.636
What you gonna do
for your birthday, Jerry?

02:48.669 --> 02:51.405
Ah, thought I'd go
to my crappy job

02:51.439 --> 02:53.641
to get yelled at
by my angry boss.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.609
You did that last year.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.844
Yeah, I know.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.347
It's a Jerry Ferro tradition.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.981
I bake a cake
for you.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.552
Do me a favor,
don't put the novelty
candles on it this year.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.986
Yeah, why not?
It's funny.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.655
No, it's not funny.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.490
I almost blew a lung out
on those things.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.260
And by the way,
who's the joke on?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.494
I'm blowing snot
all over the cake,

03:13.527 --> 03:14.928
and then you
eat three pieces?

03:14.962 --> 03:17.365
Very funny.
You blew out,
I eat the cake.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.433
No, Ozzie,
you're not listening.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.670
It's not funny.
You're eating booger cake.
[Ozzie laughing]

03:35.015 --> 03:37.785
Morning, Mike.
Nice truck.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.387
Yeah, you like it, Ferro?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.422
You know, someday,
you get your own crew,

03:41.455 --> 03:43.891
you might be able to upgrade
from your piece of shit.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.431
Thanks, buddy.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.371
I think this chicken's
gone south, Ozzie.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.372
It's cactus.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.840
Cactus?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.509
It's good.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.911
It's good if your plane
goes down in the desert,

04:03.944 --> 04:07.014
but not if you can
walk to a supermarket.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.517
What'd the old lady pack
for dessert, a pinecone?

04:09.550 --> 04:10.918
What do you take
of marriage, Jerry?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.686
What do I take
of marriage?

04:12.720 --> 04:14.888
I'm not getting married
until I get health insurance.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.558
Health insurance,
then marriage.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.858
That's my policy.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.728
You just turned 40.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.530
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna do it like you.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.897
Marriage, 30 kids

04:23.931 --> 04:25.966
with a wait-and-see approach
to health insurance.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.902
Hey, you two
get 10 minutes
for lunch.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.338
You're way behind
on this wall.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.505
Behind what?

04:31.539 --> 04:32.906
Behind schedule,
dipshit.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.508
You know, Ferro,

04:34.542 --> 04:35.709
you think you're
smarter than everyone

04:35.743 --> 04:37.711
'cause you got
a quick tongue.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.880
But you're just a grunt
working with illiterates,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.014
amounting to nothing.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.350
Leave him alone.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.052
No, hablo retardo,
Speedy Gonzalez.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.020
You know, you're lazy
even for a Mexican.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.523
Hey, Nicaragua.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.359
Oh, well, same
difference, Sanchez.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.627
Now come on,
get back to work.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.520
Ozzie.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.798
Nice try, assholes.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.545
[glass shattering]

05:44.578 --> 05:46.714
[car alarm blaring]

05:52.085 --> 05:56.089
Mike, somebody
threw a belt sander
at your windshield.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.561
Ferro.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.567
Mike, Mike, calm down.
It's the heat.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.368
It's getting to both of us.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.972
Yeah, you better run,
you pussy.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.841
And take the wetback with you!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.412
Here, take this
with you, too.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.718
Got a little going away
present for you.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.019
How about that, huh?

06:26.053 --> 06:29.557
Yeah, get the hell off
my job site, you pussy!

06:29.590 --> 06:32.826
And take the beaner with you!
I hope the Minutemen get you!

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
Thanks for the mug, buddy.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.537
I'll talk to Steve
about getting you some
work around the gym.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.580
See you.

06:52.613 --> 06:55.783
Why don't you have me
and Ozzie come in here
and spruce it up?

06:55.816 --> 06:56.950
If you're
looking for work,

06:56.984 --> 06:58.852
why don't you just
add another class?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.588
You're still
the people's choice.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.790
That's not gonna
help Ozzie.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.627
I'm running a gym here,
not an unemployment agency.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.901
Good job, Gus.
Good work.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.737
Free, can you give me
a couple of rounds?

07:16.770 --> 07:19.640
Sure, man.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.709
Work it. Yeah.
Right there.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.544
You training this guy?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.078
Nah, I'm just
babysitting him

07:25.112 --> 07:27.247
till Manny gets back
from Chicago.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.683
Just like that.
Just like that.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.686
They call you
the Hammer 'cause
you're a handyman, huh?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.623
First off,
I'm not a handyman.
I'm a carpenter.

07:35.656 --> 07:39.226
And secondly,
you're gonna find out why
they call me the Hammer.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.194
Jab. One-two.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.930
Right there.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.865
Punching angry, huh?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.500
I got fired today.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.071
Who's that guy?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.273
That's Jerry Ferro.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.743
Long lefty with some pop.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.746
What's his class?

07:58.779 --> 08:01.148
Uh, he does
the evening class.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.950
No, I mean
what weight class.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.217
He was light heavy.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.020
Back in the day,
he was pretty good.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.128
Work, work, work!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.864
[wood creaking, crash]

08:16.897 --> 08:18.732
[crowd cheering]

08:20.868 --> 08:23.937
Yo, Hammer!

08:23.971 --> 08:26.206
Come on, get your hammer
and get up here.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.644
[crowd shouting]

08:34.715 --> 08:37.049
That's the same thing
that's gonna happen
to Taylor.

08:37.083 --> 08:40.953
Hi, fellas. Hey.
Wow, what've we got here?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.655
Look at
the sky, baby.

08:42.690 --> 08:47.060
Wow. Who hangs
a heavy bag with
toggle bolts?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.662
What?

08:48.696 --> 08:49.830
God damn.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.332
No, I mean you don't
hang a heavy bag

08:52.365 --> 08:54.768
with toggle bolts
right under
the dry wall.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.204
You'd lag it into
a ceiling joist.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.573
A good fart would
take this thing down.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.841
Yo, man,
you don't know shit

09:00.874 --> 09:03.043
about punching power,
bitch.
Yeah, but--

09:03.076 --> 09:05.245
I do know something
about toggle bolts.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.015
You'd use toggle bolts,
like, you're hanging,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.817
like, a humming bird feeder,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.719
a picture, or a mobile,

09:11.752 --> 09:13.621
or like a wind chime,
or something like that.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.889
One of those dream catchers.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.960
North American Indians--

09:19.993 --> 09:21.795
use these, uh--

09:21.829 --> 09:25.899
You gotta--
You drill a pilot hole,

09:25.933 --> 09:28.168
and, you know,
I use half-inch,

09:28.201 --> 09:30.904
but some guys use 5/8,
and you would--

09:35.142 --> 09:38.779
I'm gonna take--
Take five. Take five.

09:41.281 --> 09:45.385
How would you like
to move a few rounds
with Malice Blake?

09:45.418 --> 09:48.255
That sounds fantastic.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.725
Perhaps later we could
put my balls in a vice.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.664
Hundred bucks.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.766
[crowd cheering]

10:01.301 --> 10:02.903
All right,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.105
this guy's been known
to fall for a touch and go.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.874
Understand?
Yeah.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.876
Okay.
You got the money?

10:11.344 --> 10:12.680
Time.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.822
[cheering continues]

10:45.746 --> 10:46.980
[cheering stops]

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
Oh, it's on now,
toggle bolt.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.055
[cheering continues]

11:06.266 --> 11:07.968
All right,
all right, all right!

11:08.001 --> 11:09.870
That's enough!
That's enough.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.472
That was a sample,
motherfucker!

11:12.505 --> 11:15.142
Don't go saying
you knocked Malice Blake
to the canvas.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.212
Did you fellas see me
knock Malice Blake
to the canvas?

11:19.246 --> 11:20.914
Oh!

11:21.949 --> 11:24.017
Man, that's
the slick.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.886
Jerry, you still
got it, man.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.788
Thanks. Listen.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.757
Someone's going to have
to fix that bag.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.260
Ozzie'll do it,
then Ozzie can check
all the rest of 'em, too,

11:33.293 --> 11:35.896
otherwise you're gonna
have a lawsuit on your hands.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.331
Don't worry about it.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.440
You got
a heavy left hand.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.877
How come I haven't
seen you before?

11:49.910 --> 11:51.945
I teach the 6 P.M. class.

11:51.979 --> 11:56.083
No, I mean I thought
I'd seen every pro
in California.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.185
Oh, I'm not a pro.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.787
I just fought
some Golden Gloves,

11:59.820 --> 12:00.788
that's all.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.089
So what are you?

12:02.122 --> 12:05.192
Well, up until
two hours ago,
I was a carpenter.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.494
So you still have
your amateur status?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.296
Not as a carpenter.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.364
Listen, I'm taking
a look at some prospects

12:11.398 --> 12:14.134
tomorrow morning
for the Olympic trials.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.503
[chuckles] No.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.773
No, no, that ship--
That ship sailed
a long time ago.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.843
Well, if you
change your mind.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.244
The address is on there.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.179
You're Eddie Bell.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.016
Last time I checked.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.263
Jab, cross.
One-two.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.466
Step out with the jab,
little step with the jab,

12:46.499 --> 12:47.801
and then poom!

12:47.835 --> 12:49.036
Turn the hips.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.305
Good job, Shellie.
Push off the back foot.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.811
[chuckles]
What is going
on here, new girl?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.112
What?

12:59.146 --> 13:02.149
The punch starts in
the ball of the back foot,

13:02.182 --> 13:05.152
travels up the thigh,
through the shoulder,

13:05.185 --> 13:06.286
and out the fist.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.856
Look at your fist
as a package

13:08.889 --> 13:10.390
that needs
to be delivered.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.361
Now, look at your thigh
as the UPS truck.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.229
Don't hit him with your arm.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.132
Hit him with
your thigh and your ass.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.902
Right. Uh.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.537
That was more
of a golf cart,
but all right.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.108
Stick your ass out,
suck your elbows in.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.944
Are you trying
to take a dump, Tony?

13:30.978 --> 13:33.213
Good face, Jeff.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.548
Come on. Yeah.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.287
How'd you get your shiner?

13:40.320 --> 13:44.091
Oh, let's just
say a client got
a little out of hand.

13:45.358 --> 13:50.163
I feel like prostitution
should be legal, you know?

13:50.197 --> 13:53.333
I'm a lawyer.
Public defender.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.135
Oh, yeah.
No, I figured that.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.137
I'm just saying,
apropos of nothing.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.141
It's a victimless crime.
You know.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.010
How'd you get yours?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.445
Trick got out of hand
on Santa Monica Boulevard.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.914
[laughs]

14:07.948 --> 14:11.484
Punch with your
hips, everybody.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.921
Hey, Jerry.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.222
What's going on, Jeff?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.589
I'm entering
my first tournament.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.358
Fantastic.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.027
You've been boxing
for like four weeks.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.094
You think that's
a good plan?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.930
Oh, I'm ready
for this one.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.164
It's the Gay Games.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.267
Yeah, but, Jeff,
you're not gay.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.903
No, no,
but they don't check.
That's the beauty of it.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.572
I figure I'll get
a little competitive
experience, you know?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.474
Kick a little ass.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.343
I don't know, I've seen
some of those guys.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.510
They're pretty ripped.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.312
Come on, you think
I'm gonna lose

14:39.346 --> 14:42.115
to a guy who
enters the ring
to Barbara Streisand?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.484
Uh, I think you'd
lose to Barbara Streisand.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.955
Come on. I've learned
from the best.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.997
Jerry? Jesus.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.565
I mean, you refuse to get
your contractor's license,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.167
but, what, you'll
go be a punching bag

15:00.200 --> 15:01.969
for a few extra bucks?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.237
Ozzie and I quit today.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.173
Well, Matt's an a-hole.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.675
I take on two extra shifts,

15:08.708 --> 15:12.112
and you quit your job?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.514
I'm thinking about
getting back into
competitive boxing.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
[chuckles]

15:16.416 --> 15:18.485
What a great idea.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.555
Come on, short stack,
it's my birthday.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.024
Yeah, that's right, Jerry.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.558
Another year
has come and gone,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
and you've done nothing.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.062
You just quit your job!

15:29.096 --> 15:30.597
You get another
speeding ticket,

15:30.630 --> 15:34.367
and I find
a fucking maxi pad
in the coffee maker.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.703
All right? [sighs]

15:36.736 --> 15:40.440
This isn't
working, Jerry.

15:55.288 --> 15:59.159
I knocked this guy out
in the first round.

16:05.698 --> 16:09.136
Hey, Jerry,
the best boxer I know, man.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.405
Yeah, I'm the only
boxer you know,
but thanks, buddy.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.178
Hey, it's true.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.547
Alexis Arguello.
Nicaragua!

16:20.580 --> 16:22.482
Rosendo รกlvarez.
Nicaragua.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.517
Ricardo Mayorga.
Nicaragua!

16:24.551 --> 16:25.685
Nicaragua numero uno.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.620
[all]
Nicaragua!

16:27.654 --> 16:30.290
You guys sure seem
to love Nicaragua

16:30.323 --> 16:33.226
except for the part
where you risked your lives

16:33.260 --> 16:35.462
not to live there anymore.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.431
[speaking in Spanish]

16:41.401 --> 16:45.072
All right, but one round,
then you're going to bed.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.273
Oh!
Oh!

16:46.306 --> 16:48.741
[all]
Nicaragua!

16:59.419 --> 17:03.090
Hey, Jerry,
time to bed, man.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.758
Big day tomorrow.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.796
Good night, Jerry.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.232
Good night, Oz.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.766
Jerry! Jerry!

18:20.767 --> 18:22.669
Wake up, man!

18:22.702 --> 18:25.705
You're missing
the trials, man.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.575
I'm gonna do
the Olympics next time.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.946
Better watch out
for me, Coach.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.181
I got mad skills.

19:08.215 --> 19:11.251
Pop! Pop! Pop! Bow!

19:11.284 --> 19:13.620
You got the sound
effects down.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.888
Are you his
legal guardian?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.658
No. No, I'm a boxer.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.294
[chuckles]
This ain't no open call.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.629
You have to be invited.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.830
Eddie invited me himself.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.333
Well, I guess he's
getting desperate.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.667
[chuckles]

19:27.700 --> 19:30.337
[whistle blows]

19:31.971 --> 19:34.474
Who here knows
how many gold medals

19:34.507 --> 19:36.809
the United States
boxing team has won

19:36.843 --> 19:41.348
in the last two
Olympics combined?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.950
One!

19:43.983 --> 19:45.918
That's right. Uno!

19:46.786 --> 19:49.422
Cuba has won nine.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.259
Kazakhstan has won three.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.761
I don't even know
where that is.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.397
France has won
as many gold medals

19:57.430 --> 20:00.233
as the United States
in the last two Olympics.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.969
France, for Christ's sake!

20:03.002 --> 20:05.572
Today, we're going
to find out

20:05.605 --> 20:08.441
if anyone here
might have what it takes

20:08.475 --> 20:11.278
to change that in 2008.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.383
Let's get started!

20:16.416 --> 20:18.518
[fighters grunting]
[shouting]

20:20.953 --> 20:22.021
No, no, no.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.022
No, no, no.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.857
[whistle blows]

20:30.062 --> 20:32.632
You look like shit.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.268
I didn't get
a ton of sleep
last night.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.270
Well, maybe you want
to take a rain check, huh?

20:37.304 --> 20:39.639
No, no.
No, I'm--

20:39.672 --> 20:41.408
I'm good.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.009
All right, put that on--

20:43.042 --> 20:45.812
unless you think that eyebrow
could protect your whole head.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.348
[laughs]

20:50.016 --> 20:52.452
Good stuff.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.586
[Man]
Come on!

20:53.620 --> 20:55.988
[Men cheering]

21:03.430 --> 21:05.365
[Eddie]
And time!

21:13.473 --> 21:15.575
[Men groaning]

21:18.010 --> 21:20.513
All right, I think
that's enough, huh?

21:20.547 --> 21:22.415
I'm fine.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.016
Are you sure?

21:24.050 --> 21:27.387
I've never felt
better in my life.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.722
All right, go ahead.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.570
[All]
Ooh!

22:04.891 --> 22:07.927
[Men]
Oh!

22:07.960 --> 22:11.431
[crowd whispering]

22:15.568 --> 22:17.770
Victor Padilla.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.445
Did you fight
Golden Gloves?

22:25.478 --> 22:29.716
I fought Golden Gloves,
a while back.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.017
You know,
I was watching you.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.019
You look good,
but I noticed

22:33.052 --> 22:35.488
you throw the jab,
you drop your right
just a little bit,

22:35.522 --> 22:37.757
which is fine against
an orthodox guy,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.826
but if you get in
with a southpaw,

22:39.859 --> 22:42.595
you know,
that could be trouble.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.803
So when was your last fight?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.705
November.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.509
1987.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.678
[laughs]
How come?

22:59.846 --> 23:01.047
Hey, it's none
of my business.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.615
I'd like to see
what you could do

23:02.649 --> 23:04.651
if you took care
of yourself.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.419
I want you
to lose 15 pounds

23:06.453 --> 23:09.622
and be ready to fight
at 178 in a month.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.524
What's in a month?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.727
The regionals in Phoenix.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.496
Congratulations.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.732
* [ska]

23:22.068 --> 23:23.903
* Fueled by a lack

23:23.936 --> 23:26.072
* Drew inspiration
from a need *

23:26.105 --> 23:30.209
* So many problems
to crack *

23:30.242 --> 23:32.612
* And mouths to feed

23:32.645 --> 23:35.515
* Crooked was the path

23:35.548 --> 23:40.086
[grunting song melody]

23:40.119 --> 23:42.789
* The last hurrah?
Nu-uh *

23:42.822 --> 23:43.956
* I'd do it again

23:43.990 --> 23:46.493
[grunting song melody]

23:46.526 --> 23:49.095
* The rascal king
behind the bars *

23:49.128 --> 23:50.863
* Or the one
in front of them *

23:50.897 --> 23:51.998
* Let's go

23:52.031 --> 23:53.733
* The last hurrah?
Nu-uh *

23:53.766 --> 23:55.935
* Do it again

23:55.968 --> 23:57.236
[grunting song melody]

23:57.269 --> 23:59.739
* The rascal king
behind the bars *

23:59.772 --> 24:01.708
* Or the one
in front of them *

24:01.741 --> 24:03.843
All right, everyone,
find your bag

24:03.876 --> 24:05.645
and do something
horrible to it.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.847
Not you, Lindsay.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.248
I wanna work
a little shoe shine,

24:09.281 --> 24:10.850
a little left, right.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.552
Okay.
All right.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.053
You ready?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.588
Are you ready?

24:15.622 --> 24:16.923
Let's see what you got.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.759
[grunting]

24:19.792 --> 24:21.060
[chuckles]

24:21.093 --> 24:23.730
Don't take the mace
off the key chain just yet.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.865
Come on.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.670
You got plans tomorrow?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.940
Not during the day.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.976
Maybe we should
just hold off

24:37.009 --> 24:38.978
until an evening
frees up for you.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.880
Oh, just pick me up
at noon tomorrow.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.248
What's the big deal?

24:42.281 --> 24:44.884
Oh, the dreaded day date.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.219
Oh, come on,
what is so bad
about a day date?

24:47.253 --> 24:48.688
What's so bad about it?

24:48.721 --> 24:52.592
It's not a date,
it's an outing at best.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.561
Jerry girlfriend
leaving him.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.528
Excuse me?

24:55.562 --> 24:57.129
Jerry girlfriend
leaving him.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.998
She--
My girlfriend.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.299
Oh.
We-- We broke up.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.668
I'm sorry.
Broke up, yeah.

25:01.701 --> 25:02.935
Have you guys met?

25:02.969 --> 25:05.638
Lindsay, Loud-mouth.
Loud-mouth, Lindsay.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.039
When?

25:07.073 --> 25:09.742
She left, uh--

25:09.776 --> 25:11.077
You know,
it's been a while.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.112
Wednesday.
Wednesday.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.581
Wednesday.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.550
She technically
moved out on Wednesday,

25:17.584 --> 25:21.320
but she checked out
a year before that.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.254
We both did.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.557
Oh.
It's been a while.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.659
Well, um,
I'll see you at noon.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.027
All right.
Bye-bye.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.663
See you.
Nice to meet you.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.666
Silky smooth.
Yeah.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.134
Silk.
Working?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.704
Yeah, velvety smooth.
Oh.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.573
I don't know if you can
understand this, Ozzie,

25:40.607 --> 25:43.275
but chicks don't dig it
when they find out

25:43.309 --> 25:44.711
you've been dumped.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.145
But it's true.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.781
It's also true
I have a hairy ass,

25:48.815 --> 25:52.719
but I don't weave it into
every conversation I have.

25:58.858 --> 25:59.859
Hey, yo, Vic.

25:59.892 --> 26:00.960
You know Coach
won gold

26:00.993 --> 26:02.662
in four different
weight classes?

26:02.695 --> 26:04.330
I'm gonna make it five.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.332
I'm going to be his
second lightweight.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.267
Hey, they say
you're pretty good
with the little dudes.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.202
Let's see what
you're gonna do
with the big boys.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.605
[kissing]
What's happening,
fellas?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.742
Well, if it isn't
the Pale Rider.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.209
I was just telling
my man Vic here

26:17.243 --> 26:18.811
how I'm gonna be the latest
in Coach Bell's

26:18.845 --> 26:20.880
long tradition
of Olympic champs.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.616
Are you light heavy?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.251
That's right.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.153
I'm surprised Eddie
didn't tell you,

26:27.186 --> 26:30.657
but I'm going to be the new
sheriff around here at 178.

26:33.025 --> 26:33.960
You?

26:33.993 --> 26:35.194
Good, good.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.996
I'm glad you guys
got to know each other,

26:37.029 --> 26:39.331
'cause you're going
to be spending a lot
of time together.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.800
Let's get to work.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.234
Hold on, Coach.
Man, you can't be serious.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.771
This dude's, like,
40 years old.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.238
I'm standing
right here,
you know?

26:46.272 --> 26:47.406
I can hear what
you're saying.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.808
Coach, man,
you wouldn't give

26:48.841 --> 26:50.209
a 40-year-old
black guy a shot.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.944
Yeah, Coach,
when is the black man

26:51.978 --> 26:53.345
finally gonna get
a fair shake

26:53.379 --> 26:54.814
in the fight game?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.983
Come on, let's get
a little lather going.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.695
Okay, let's keep
the feet moving,

27:42.729 --> 27:44.396
keep the elbows in,
and your hands up.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.833
Amateur boxing is about
scoring punches.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.803
A light jab scores
just as much as a big hook.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.039
And a knockout still
counts, though, right?

27:53.072 --> 27:54.941
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, it counts.

27:54.974 --> 27:58.144
All right.
And, time!

28:03.883 --> 28:05.384
[laughs]
You know what?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.153
If you think I want
some middle-aged,

28:07.186 --> 28:08.420
middle-class white dude

28:08.454 --> 28:10.189
thinking he's in some
boxing fantasy camp

28:10.222 --> 28:11.824
messing with my mission,

28:11.858 --> 28:15.161
[scoffs]
man, you even more
stupid than you look.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.064
I'd have kicked
your ass,

28:18.097 --> 28:19.966
but calling me
middle-class

28:19.999 --> 28:24.136
is about the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.146
[engine clanking]

28:36.115 --> 28:38.184
How much
for the roses?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.318
$12 a dozen.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.454
Will you take ten bucks
for the dozen?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.023
Okay.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.292
Como se llama?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.895
Carlos.
Carlos.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.297
Carlos, two days ago,
my friend,

28:51.330 --> 28:52.899
I was right
where you're at.

28:52.932 --> 28:56.335
Not on the onramp
of the 405,

28:56.368 --> 28:57.336
but in my head.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.370
You know what I mean?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.772
I didn't know
what was going on.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.908
I was at a crossroads
in my life.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.876
Now, look at me.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.313
Huh?

29:07.346 --> 29:09.515
You know, it's like--
like I wanna tell everyone
about this, you know?

29:09.548 --> 29:12.118
And I'm thinking, like,
what do you want to do,
Carlos?

29:12.151 --> 29:15.154
When's your time?
You know what I mean?

29:15.187 --> 29:16.789
When's Carlos
going to start doing

29:16.823 --> 29:18.390
what Carlos wants
to do, right?

29:18.424 --> 29:19.959
All right?
All right.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.393
All right.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.196
What's Carlos want to do?

29:26.132 --> 29:28.534
Peanut?

29:30.870 --> 29:33.139
[Jerry]
Uh, the door's
a little sticky

29:33.172 --> 29:34.440
on the passenger side,

29:34.473 --> 29:37.977
so just hang tight here
and I'll explain.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.017
It's, uh--
It's kind of
a two-man gig.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.418
Just stay clear there.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.520
On three,
lift the handle, please.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.122
You want me to lift it?

29:50.156 --> 29:52.491
Yeah, lift it on three,
but just stay wide of it.

29:52.524 --> 29:53.860
All right, you ready?
Yeah.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.428
One, two, three.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.396
One more--
One more try.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.430
Okay.
We'll go-- Okay?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.599
Ready? Here we go.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.201
Perfect.
Okay.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.236
Like you've been doing it
your whole life.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.337
Your chariot awaits.

30:05.371 --> 30:08.540
Nice to see chivalry
isn't dead.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.147
And because--

30:15.181 --> 30:17.083
the door's been flying open
on left-hand turns,

30:17.116 --> 30:18.450
I'll give you
a little bungee action.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.486
Okay.
There.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.921
Thank you.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.556
And it's off we go.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.131
The La Brea Tar Pits.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.900
Yeah.
Wow.

30:33.933 --> 30:38.237
This date's officially been
downgraded to a field trip.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.272
Come on, now what's wrong
with the La Brea Tar Pits?

30:40.306 --> 30:42.241
I've lived in L.A.
for six years,
I've never been.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.176
I really want
to see them.
You want to see them?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.277
Yeah.
You want to see them?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.413
Close your eyes--

30:47.446 --> 30:50.382
and picture a giant pit

30:50.416 --> 30:53.319
filled with used
transmission fluid.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.288
We've been there.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.890
[Lindsay]
God, look,
it's really bubbling.

30:57.924 --> 31:00.927
Yeah, I really--
I owe you an apology.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.361
This is breath-taking.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.663
Can you smell it?
I wish I had a condo
right here.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.566
To wake up every morning
to the smell of burning tar.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.369
No other city but Los Angeles
would put up with this.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.637
It's really
an embarrassment.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.306
Is it more than you
even dared to dream?

31:14.340 --> 31:17.543
Tar is not an attraction,
it's a detraction.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.278
You try to get
away from tar.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.346
I don't know why
there's not

31:20.379 --> 31:21.647
more postcards
with this on it.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.116
Do chick mastodons
have the tusks

31:24.150 --> 31:25.317
or is that just
the dude--

31:25.351 --> 31:27.119
Any other city,
by the way,

31:27.153 --> 31:29.421
would have filled this in
with kitty litter years ago.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.522
This is humiliating.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.391
Look, it says here
that every one

31:32.424 --> 31:34.126
of the exhibits
in the museum

31:34.160 --> 31:35.627
was pulled from
one of these pits.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.696
Right in the middle of L.A.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.231
I'll tell ya, I--

31:39.265 --> 31:40.599
My heart's beating
too fast.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.334
I think I gotta sit down.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.569
Los Angeles is awesome.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.571
No professional
football team,

31:45.604 --> 31:49.308
but all the fiberglass
elephants you want.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.643
Look at these kids.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.413
They look pissed off that
they're not at Disneyland.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.149
I would sue my parents
if they took me here.

31:57.183 --> 31:58.650
[Lindsay]
Oh, look!

31:58.684 --> 32:01.153
I did not realize
we were gonna get
to experience

32:01.187 --> 32:03.055
what it would be like
to be trapped in tar.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.957
I was all wrong
about this place.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.292
See?
Yeah.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.626
I told you
how fun it is.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.595
Yeah, and maybe later
we could find out

32:09.628 --> 32:11.697
what it feels like
to step in a bear trap

32:11.730 --> 32:14.133
or be run over
by a cattle truck.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.068
This is going to be
a great day.
Yeah.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.238
You wanna dip an apple
into that or something,
or you're okay?

32:19.271 --> 32:20.339
No, I'm good.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.475
[Jerry]
24,000 years.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.113
[sotto voce]
I think someone needs
to read their Bible again.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.016
[Lindsay]
Doesn't it make you feel
kind of insignificant?

32:30.049 --> 32:33.519
[Jerry]
Oh, I had that covered
a long time ago.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.221
Don't you ever
ponder your place

32:35.254 --> 32:37.189
in the continuum
of life?

32:37.223 --> 32:38.290
Well, wherever it is,

32:38.324 --> 32:42.094
I'm sure it's behind
the slow driver.

32:42.128 --> 32:46.665
I'd put you
right about here.

32:46.698 --> 32:49.535
That reminds me,
it is loincloth season.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.103
I gotta get into shape.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.439
[chuckling]

32:53.472 --> 32:56.175
Are your glutes
this size?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.710
No, that's enhanced.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.646
So, what happens
at the regionals?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.781
Well, if I win
at the regionals,

33:02.814 --> 33:04.416
then I go
to the nationals.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.718
And if you win
at the nationals?

33:06.752 --> 33:09.521
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.723
Success isn't
exactly in my DNA.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.259
But if you did?

33:13.292 --> 33:16.495
If I did,
I go to the Olympics.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.497
Oh.

33:19.598 --> 33:23.335
So, why did you quit
in the first place?

33:23.369 --> 33:25.037
I killed a man
in the ring.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.438
Oh, my God, really?

33:26.472 --> 33:29.675
Nah. I wish I had
an excuse that good.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.211
I was just, you know--

33:32.244 --> 33:33.712
I don't have
any reason why.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.514
I didn't get clipped
by a motorcycle

33:35.547 --> 33:37.149
or have to take care
of my sick mom.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.685
I was just-- I was 19
and I was stupid.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.321
Like, when you're 19,
you just--

33:42.354 --> 33:43.722
At that age,
it's just more fun

33:43.755 --> 33:45.391
to play Atari
and smoke pot

33:45.424 --> 33:48.427
than it is to do
sit-ups and road work.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.196
And at what age
is doing sit-ups

33:50.229 --> 33:53.432
more fun than getting high
and playing video games?

33:53.465 --> 33:56.502
That age.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.504
[Jerry]
Public defender.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.473
But why grind
through law school

34:01.507 --> 34:03.775
if not to cash in
on the big bucks?

34:03.809 --> 34:06.345
Irrational love
of the underdog.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.813
And by "underdog"
you mean crackhead?

34:08.847 --> 34:12.118
Hey, not all my clients
are crackheads.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.252
Some are meth-heads.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.386
[chuckles]
[phone ringing]

34:14.420 --> 34:15.687
There's probably
one now.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.724
Just a sec.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.757
Hello?

34:19.791 --> 34:23.195
But it's Saturday.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.732
Crime doesn't take
weekends off,
I'm afraid.

34:26.764 --> 34:29.135
You're so butch.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.141
[Lindsay]
Well, that was fun--

34:35.174 --> 34:36.375
for a day date.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.310
A little abbreviated.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.745
Perhaps we can
work our way up

34:39.777 --> 34:41.213
to late afternoon date?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.848
Maybe even a dusk date?

34:42.880 --> 34:46.118
I know a romantic little
landfill up in Pacoima.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.152
You'd love it.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.654
Oh, I'm sure I would,

34:48.687 --> 34:50.589
but, um, this is
a rough stretch for me.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.491
I have depositions
all week.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.126
Yeah, me too.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.363
I mean, not depositions,
but I'm up early

34:57.396 --> 34:59.231
because I'm in
training now,
you know.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.599
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, training regimen.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.268
Crack of dawn
and road work.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.470
You know,
the whole thing.
Right.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.739
Well, I'll see you
in class.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.408
Okay.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.254
Take care.

35:23.422 --> 35:25.424
I got it.

35:37.836 --> 35:41.173
[tires squealing]

35:48.980 --> 35:53.219
[alarm beeping]

35:53.252 --> 35:55.221

36:14.240 --> 36:15.907
[lamp breaking]

36:18.977 --> 36:20.779
196, Coach.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.348
[sighs]

36:22.381 --> 36:23.682
Oh, you're off
to a great start.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.384
You put on three pounds.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.453
Muscle mass, Coach.
Ah.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.888
I just don't see how
you can be skinny and fat

36:29.921 --> 36:31.490
at the same time.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.891
You know, I've see guys
like you before.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.227
You're one of those
95-percenters

36:35.261 --> 36:37.763
who never quite gives it
everything he's got.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.831
Actually,
I'm a 75-percenter

36:39.865 --> 36:42.401
who's giving you
an extra 20%.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.769
Get out of here.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.405
Scrub.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.608
Okay. And jab.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.478
Jab, jab, jab.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.647
Jab, jab, jab.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.015
And uppercut.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.250
Uppercut.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.785
Uppercut. Uppercut.

36:59.818 --> 37:00.786
Uppercut.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.354
Oz! Ho!

37:02.388 --> 37:04.523
Oswaldo Sanchez,
everybody.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.658
Yeah, thank you.

37:06.692 --> 37:07.759
Thanks for
covering for me.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.795
You go vomit
in the men's room.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.364
Sorry I'm late.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.899
Weight on the ball
of the back foot.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.934
Start with
the straight jab.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.438
Don't be squared off.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.707
This is the third class
she's missed.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.275
I don't know, buddy.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.943
You know, some women,
you tell them

37:24.976 --> 37:26.712
you have no money,

37:26.745 --> 37:28.914
no education,
no career path, and pow,

37:28.947 --> 37:30.749
they lose interest.

37:30.782 --> 37:34.886
Yeah, I know.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.055
Just as well, anyway.
You know, with my
training schedule,

37:37.088 --> 37:40.526
I don't have time to jump
into a new relationship.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.071
You guys got ten days
to the regionals,

37:53.104 --> 37:55.073
and you both need
six months work.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.977
You can use your back hand,
but only to the body,

37:59.010 --> 38:01.747
nothing to the head,
you got it? Time!

38:06.117 --> 38:08.053
Ho, whoa!
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

38:08.086 --> 38:09.788
Get off!
I told you--

38:09.821 --> 38:12.524
I told you
no punches to the head!

38:12.558 --> 38:15.361
All right, you guys
wanna fight, take it outside.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.962
In here, we box.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.635
Yeah, weight on the ball
of the back foot,

38:23.669 --> 38:26.438
and then turn the hip.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.541
Al though you don't
have hips, but if you had 'em,

38:29.575 --> 38:31.510
turn 'em,
and drive the right.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.011
Hey, yo, Jerry,
what's next?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.113
How to hit the canvas?

38:35.146 --> 38:38.083
Whoever does not
love his brother,
cannot love God.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.686
And whoever loves God
must love his brother.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.389
He ain't my brother. Huh.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.923
But he sure is heavy.

38:44.956 --> 38:48.927
You ain't gonna never
make 178, fat boy.

38:52.798 --> 38:54.900
I gotta get into
shape, Oz-man.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.369
I train you, man.
No worry.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.671
Yeah, I gotta
get on your program.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.773
Orale queso.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.341
What's your secret?

39:12.818 --> 39:15.787
* Oh, plug me in
and turn me on *

39:15.821 --> 39:18.524
* Listen here
'cause here it come *

39:18.557 --> 39:21.460
* Got hot licks on
your guitar strings *

39:21.493 --> 39:24.730
* Riffs and rhythms
and guitar things *

39:24.763 --> 39:26.598
* Turn me on and turn me up
and turn me loose *

39:26.632 --> 39:29.768
* I am alive and amplified

39:29.801 --> 39:31.703
* Turn me on and turn me up
and turn me loose *

39:31.737 --> 39:35.006
* I am alive and amplified

39:35.040 --> 39:37.008
* Turn me on and turn me up
and turn me loose *

39:37.042 --> 39:40.479
* I am alive and amplified

39:40.512 --> 39:42.514
* Turn me on and turn me up
and turn me loose *

39:42.548 --> 39:44.916
* I am alive and amplified

39:44.950 --> 39:47.553
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *

39:47.586 --> 39:50.088
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *

39:50.121 --> 39:52.958
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *

39:52.991 --> 39:55.093
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *

39:55.126 --> 39:57.763
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *

39:57.796 --> 40:00.866
* Na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na *
[laughing]

40:08.640 --> 40:10.509
Whoo! Yeah.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.082
Gordito.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.186
Get off of there,
you jackass.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.657
178, baby.

40:25.691 --> 40:26.758
You got it.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.759
178.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.528
Punch it. Go ahead.

40:29.561 --> 40:32.030
Get away from here.
Are you kidding?

40:42.941 --> 40:44.576
Hey, Coach--

40:44.610 --> 40:46.778
I thought I was
your light heavy.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.146
You wanna win
the gold medal,

40:48.179 --> 40:49.648
and you're worried
about Jerry?

40:49.681 --> 40:51.149
No, I just don't see
why he has to be here.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.919
Every great champion
had someone to push them.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.654
Robinson had LaMotta,

40:55.687 --> 40:57.756
Archie Moore
had Joey Maxim,

40:57.789 --> 41:00.759
Zale and Graziano
had--each other.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.227
Who are those guys?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.662
Ah. Listen.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.931
Two of your biggest
challenges for the gold

41:05.964 --> 41:07.633
are tall lefties
like Jerry.

41:07.666 --> 41:11.169
Now, I could pay him
100 bucks a day
to spar with you,

41:11.202 --> 41:15.106
or I could let him
think he's got a shot
at making the team,

41:15.140 --> 41:17.242
and get him for free.

41:17.275 --> 41:20.512
Trust me, working
with Jerry every day

41:20.546 --> 41:23.014
is gonna help you
win a gold medal.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.950
You're my light
heavyweight.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.618
Huh?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.087
Okay, Coach.
Huh?

41:38.730 --> 41:39.865
You got some change?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.733
Yeah.
All right.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.735
Remember, you're
worried about
your citizenship,

41:43.769 --> 41:46.538
your record,
and your eligibility,

41:46.572 --> 41:50.075
and Uncle Jerr
is the only one

41:50.108 --> 41:52.043
willing to stick
his neck out for you.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.178
All right?

41:53.211 --> 41:54.780
But I was born
here in Los Angeles.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.548
Don't overthink
it, buddy.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.817
Just act natural.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.254
This comes off his record
when he turns 18 next month.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.894
His parole's been impeccable.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.262
I don't see anything
to be worried about here.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.832
Victor, what made you
think you had a problem?

42:13.865 --> 42:16.935
[heavy accent]
Jerry is the only
one who help me.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.971
Wow. I gotta tell you,
this is a personal
relief to me.

42:20.005 --> 42:21.172
I mean,
this is great news.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.340
I told you.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.942
I told you it
would all work out.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.844
Uh, listen, why don't
you go wait out front,

42:25.877 --> 42:28.580
let Jerry mop up
in here?

42:28.614 --> 42:30.682
Huh? Good news, huh?

42:30.716 --> 42:32.651
I'll get you
some ice cream.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.921
That's, uh--

42:35.954 --> 42:37.589
Poor kid.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.791
I've seen what society
can do to these kids.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.594
The latch,
the latchkey kids.

42:42.628 --> 42:44.763
They just-- just
turn their backs
on these kids.

42:44.796 --> 42:48.133
Then I've seen the
streets just chew 'em up
and spit 'em out.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.234
They're--
They're dis--

42:49.267 --> 42:51.069
They're dispensable.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.804
Dispendable--
Expendable.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.274
Missing class?

42:56.307 --> 42:58.243
Yeah, I've been swamped.

42:58.276 --> 43:02.247
Oh. You think a night
might free up for you?

43:02.280 --> 43:05.651
It doesn't look good.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.088
How about dinner
tomorrow night?

43:10.121 --> 43:11.990
Pick me up at eight?

43:12.023 --> 43:13.324
Works for me.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.028
Oh, and Jerry?

43:17.062 --> 43:20.165
You could've just called.

43:20.198 --> 43:23.134
Yeah.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.940
Did a perp really
take a swing at you?

43:28.974 --> 43:30.308
Oh, not exactly.

43:30.341 --> 43:31.777
They offered us
a plea bargain,

43:31.810 --> 43:33.912
I said he should take it,
he got mad,

43:33.945 --> 43:35.280
threw my scales of
justice paperweight at me,

43:35.313 --> 43:36.982
I ducked and hit
my head on the desk.

43:37.015 --> 43:38.850
Oh. You know,
when my boss

43:38.884 --> 43:40.418
was attacking me
with a pickaxe,
[laughs]

43:40.451 --> 43:42.320
I tendered
my resignation

43:42.353 --> 43:43.889
right then and there
on the spot.

43:43.922 --> 43:46.124
I said to him,
"Good day to you, sir!"
I see.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.926
I bid him adieu
right there.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.661
Can we still
call you the Hammer

43:49.695 --> 43:51.129
even though you're not
a carpenter anymore?

43:51.162 --> 43:55.133
Yes, because I got
the name not because
I'm a carpenter,

43:55.166 --> 43:58.136
but because
I knocked this kid out
many years ago.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.238
That's where I got
the nickname the Hammer.

44:00.271 --> 44:02.207
Oh, really?
Yes.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.975
Really. I got this.

44:04.009 --> 44:05.944
You just lost your job.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.847
Yep, but I picked up
a bunch of classes
at the gym,

44:08.880 --> 44:10.315
and Steve's having
me and Ozzie

44:10.348 --> 44:12.250
do some work
around the place,
so I'm flush.

44:12.283 --> 44:14.319
I'm thinking about
retiring in a few years.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.187
I'm going out
tiara shopping
after this.

44:16.221 --> 44:17.288
You need a tiara?

44:17.322 --> 44:18.724
A pony?

44:18.757 --> 44:20.158
Let's go Dutch.

44:20.191 --> 44:22.994
The Dutch must be
some cheap bastards

44:23.028 --> 44:25.396
to be known
throughout the word
for this one thing.

44:25.430 --> 44:26.998
You ever think
about that?

44:27.032 --> 44:29.868
Yes. Well, don't forget
tulips or wooden shoes.

44:29.901 --> 44:31.737
Yeah, but when people
say let's go Dutch,

44:31.770 --> 44:33.772
they're not talking about
going wooden shoe shopping,

44:33.805 --> 44:35.440
they're talking about
splitting the check.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.242
I'm just saying,
how many checks

44:37.275 --> 44:39.044
do you have to split
as a nation

44:39.077 --> 44:41.079
before this becomes
your thing?

44:41.112 --> 44:44.082
And do you think
they find it racist?

44:44.115 --> 44:45.717
I would find it racist.

44:45.751 --> 44:47.252
I didn't mean to slur
the entire country
of Holland.

44:47.285 --> 44:48.854
I just think
we should split it.

44:48.887 --> 44:50.021
Well, we're not

44:50.055 --> 44:51.890
because this is going
in the books

44:51.923 --> 44:53.859
as a date, not a draw,
all right?

44:53.892 --> 44:57.462
So--you can, uh--

44:57.495 --> 44:59.831
Try that one, my good man.

44:59.865 --> 45:02.000
And, uh, take
these two for backup.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.135
[mouths words]

45:08.539 --> 45:11.142
So what's the best
part of your job?

45:11.176 --> 45:13.011
Getting someone
a second chance.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.880
And what's the worst
part of your job?

45:14.913 --> 45:16.281
Watching them squander it

45:16.314 --> 45:18.149
and come back across
my desk a month later.

45:18.183 --> 45:21.787
Oh. This is nice
stucco work.

45:21.820 --> 45:24.189
You know, this is done
with a sponge trowel,

45:24.222 --> 45:26.324
and if you wanted it
to be smooth,
you'd use a--

45:26.357 --> 45:28.860
I don't do stucco, really.
--a metal trowel.

45:37.102 --> 45:40.071
It's too bad
you're in training.

45:40.105 --> 45:41.472
Why?

45:41.506 --> 45:43.208
Well, don't they say
that boxers should

45:43.241 --> 45:46.211
refrain from intimacy
when they're in training?

45:46.244 --> 45:49.047
[scoffs]
That old wives' tale?

45:49.080 --> 45:50.115
Please.

45:50.148 --> 45:51.449
That's a thousand
years old.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.885
Well, you know, Eastern
philosophy says that

45:53.919 --> 45:57.222
you expend massive
amounts of chi when you--

45:57.255 --> 45:58.790
Eastern philosophy?
Yeah.

45:58.824 --> 46:00.258
We're in Burbank,
grasshopper,

46:00.291 --> 46:02.093
and I got enough chi
for the whole valley.

46:02.127 --> 46:03.261
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

46:03.294 --> 46:04.863
Yeah, I'm overstocked
with chi.

46:04.896 --> 46:06.264
Watch out, it's
chi dealing days.

46:06.297 --> 46:07.365
Oh, really?

46:07.398 --> 46:08.566
Yes, I'm
Chi Chi Rodriguez.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.235
Believe me,
I'm a Chia Pet.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.269
Okay, no, no.

46:11.302 --> 46:12.370
I'm not gonna
be responsible for

46:12.403 --> 46:14.005
messing up your
big comeback. No.

46:14.039 --> 46:17.375
I will gladly
sign a waiver.

46:17.408 --> 46:21.246
You could draft it up
in your lunch hour.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.048
It'll be all aboveboard.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.886
Let me know
how it goes, okay?

46:27.919 --> 46:30.255
All right,
I'll call you
from Arizona.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.191
Don't take too many
shots to the face.

46:33.224 --> 46:35.360
Oh, that's inspirational.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.129
How about a little
something like,
"I believe in you, Jerry"?

46:38.163 --> 46:40.065
Oh, right.

46:40.098 --> 46:41.833
I believe
in you, Jerry.

46:41.867 --> 46:43.334
How could I lose?

46:58.083 --> 46:59.217
I'll see you
in Phoenix.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.252
You're not riding
with us, Coach?

47:01.286 --> 47:04.322
I'm too old for
a six-hour van ride.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.958
I'm flying.
I'll be there
when you get there.

47:06.992 --> 47:09.360
Okay. Hey, uh, Coach,
you think we could use

47:09.394 --> 47:11.562
a little extra
help in the corner?

47:12.998 --> 47:14.432
Yeah?
Yeah.

47:14.465 --> 47:16.167
Ozzie!

47:21.572 --> 47:22.941
Coach.

47:22.974 --> 47:24.943
No, you get your rest
and stay focused.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.212
Basically, this should be
just a walkover for you.

47:27.245 --> 47:28.947
Give you a chance
to work on some of

47:28.980 --> 47:30.148
the things
I taught you, okay?

47:30.181 --> 47:31.282
Okay.

47:31.316 --> 47:33.284
Come on, the party
patrol's leaving!

47:34.185 --> 47:35.954
Poor schmuck.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.523
It's a long way to drive
just to get your ass kicked.
[chuckles]

47:48.333 --> 47:51.269
Who's your
favorite boxer?

47:51.302 --> 47:53.038
Me.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.239
Shocking.

47:54.272 --> 47:57.242
You know, Coach Bell
says two fighters

47:57.275 --> 48:00.345
from each weight division
can advance, so--

48:00.378 --> 48:03.181
we may both move on
to the nationals.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.650
Look, man, maybe
after I knock you out,

48:05.683 --> 48:08.086
we can spend some time
really connecting.

48:08.119 --> 48:09.354
But in the meantime,

48:09.387 --> 48:12.057
this ain't no
Big Brother program.

48:12.090 --> 48:13.291
That's good.

48:13.324 --> 48:15.193
Take that energy,
take that hostility,

48:15.226 --> 48:16.261
and harness it.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.562
Use it.

48:17.595 --> 48:20.698
You've got the eye of
the asshole, my brother.

48:20.731 --> 48:25.971
[Ozzie]
Cheeseburger. Cheeseburger.
Onion ring. Chicken nugget.

48:26.004 --> 48:27.505
Keep digging, Ozzie.

48:27.538 --> 48:30.441
I'm sure there's
some cactus in
there somewhere.

48:34.145 --> 48:37.015
I see where you got
your killer abs.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.085
Hey, look, Jerry,
don't even start talkin'
how the black athlete

48:40.118 --> 48:42.353
don't have to work
as hard to stay fit.

48:42.387 --> 48:43.554
No. That's right.

48:43.588 --> 48:46.157
Everyone's
exactly the same.

48:46.191 --> 48:49.127
Eskimos and Kenyans
have the same metabolism.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.261
And the Kenyans,

48:50.295 --> 48:51.562
they just win the
marathons every year

48:51.596 --> 48:53.131
because they're better
at jogging.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.732
What is it?

48:54.765 --> 48:58.003
If I said blacks were
better natural athletes,
you'd be pissed.

48:58.036 --> 49:00.638
If I said whites were
better natural athletes,
you'd be pissed.

49:00.671 --> 49:03.041
If I said we were the same,
you'd be pissed.

49:03.074 --> 49:05.243
So screw it,
you're gonna be pissed.

49:05.276 --> 49:06.711
You know what, Jerry?

49:06.744 --> 49:08.713
I'm sensing a little jealousy.

49:08.746 --> 49:11.749
Are you mad because
I'm a black Lamborghini,

49:11.782 --> 49:14.685
and you're just putting
along in a Ford Festiva?

49:15.686 --> 49:17.722
How's that salad?

49:17.755 --> 49:19.657
Tastes like a rabbit
crapped in my mouth.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.565
[indistinct chatter]

49:36.174 --> 49:38.476
Jesus Christ,
that guy's an amateur?

49:38.509 --> 49:40.111
That's Darius Reece.

49:40.145 --> 49:42.647
Coach Bell said
he'd make sure he's
not in my bracket,

49:42.680 --> 49:45.150
so I don't have to worry
about him till the nationals.

49:53.291 --> 49:54.592
Oh, perfect.

49:54.625 --> 49:56.427
Anybody you want us
to notify?

49:56.461 --> 49:58.229
Next of kin?

49:58.263 --> 50:00.165
Are you an organ donor?

50:00.198 --> 50:02.300
The Lord works through me.

50:02.333 --> 50:06.304
He is all knowing
and forgiving.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.373
I know He loves me,
and He loves you, too

50:08.406 --> 50:11.709
because we are
all His children.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.445
God loves us all.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.247
He is love.

50:26.457 --> 50:27.658
Amen.

50:29.394 --> 50:30.461
Coach.

50:30.495 --> 50:31.429
Robert.

50:31.462 --> 50:33.631
So where's Jerry?

50:33.664 --> 50:35.566
I'm going to tape him up.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.336
That's one cold draw
he got with Reece.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.338
He served his purpose.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.108
You just worry about
what you have to do.

50:44.442 --> 50:47.312
Coach, don't let him
get hurt too bad.

50:53.318 --> 50:56.754
Now, you can't fight
inside with this guy.

50:56.787 --> 50:59.157
He's too strong.

50:59.190 --> 51:01.126
And you can't dance
on the outside.

51:01.159 --> 51:02.627
He's too fast.

51:02.660 --> 51:03.694
What's that leave?

51:03.728 --> 51:05.530
Construction.

51:07.332 --> 51:09.100
Hey, I'm just kidding.

51:09.134 --> 51:10.368
But you gotta keep moving.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.271
This guy was not
the number-one ranked amateur

51:13.304 --> 51:15.140
five years ago for nothing.

51:15.173 --> 51:17.442
What's he been doing
for the last five years?

51:17.475 --> 51:19.577
He's been doing five years.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.585
I gotta pee.

51:27.618 --> 51:30.788
I just taped your gloves.

51:30.821 --> 51:33.491
And you've got
a protective cup on.

51:33.524 --> 51:36.127
I'm not gonna help you.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.700
It's gotta go down
and to the left.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.835
Hold still.
Don't fight me.

51:44.869 --> 51:48.306
Hurry. Hurry.

51:48.339 --> 51:49.374
[door opens]

51:49.407 --> 51:51.542
It's too hard, man.
It's too hard.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.144
Quit complaining.

51:53.178 --> 51:55.313
I not sign up for this.

51:55.346 --> 51:58.249
[crowd cheering]

52:22.607 --> 52:24.709
Come on.
Be hard to hit

52:24.742 --> 52:26.611
and jab, jab, jab.

52:26.644 --> 52:29.880
Yeah, be hard to hit, Jerry.
And jab, jab jab.

52:29.914 --> 52:31.616
Work the body early.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.184
Work the body, Jerry.

52:34.752 --> 52:36.221
[bell dings]

52:38.956 --> 52:42.227
* Love is a burning thing

52:43.928 --> 52:47.732
* And it makes a fiery ring

52:49.600 --> 52:54.205
* Bound by wild desire

52:54.239 --> 52:55.673
Ozzie!

52:55.706 --> 52:57.708
Sorry.

52:57.742 --> 52:58.876
[bell dings]

53:00.511 --> 53:04.815
* I fell into
a burning ring of fire *

53:04.849 --> 53:07.552
* I went down, down, down

53:07.585 --> 53:10.555
* And the flames went higher

53:10.588 --> 53:13.758
* And it burns, burns, burns

53:13.791 --> 53:16.894
You can't stand right
in front of this guy.
He's killing you.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.497
He'll be punched out
by the tenth round, Coach.

53:19.530 --> 53:21.432
It's only
a four-round fight.

53:21.466 --> 53:23.801
Oh, thank Christ,
'cause I'm gassed.
[bell dings]

53:23.834 --> 53:28.839
* I fell into
a burning ring of fire *

53:28.873 --> 53:31.442
* I went down, down, down

53:31.476 --> 53:34.579
* And the flames went higher

53:34.612 --> 53:37.748
* And it burns, burns, burns

53:37.782 --> 53:40.451
* The ring of fire

* The ring of fire

[bell dings]

53:44.054 --> 53:46.357
* The ring of fire

53:46.391 --> 53:48.793
* The ring of fire

53:48.826 --> 53:50.695
I gotta get going.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.430
What do you mean?

53:52.463 --> 53:54.299
I gotta go tape Robert.

53:54.332 --> 53:56.567
I got another
round here, Coach.

53:56.601 --> 53:59.937
Hey, we had a good run.

53:59.970 --> 54:01.806
Good run?
This is my first fight.

54:01.839 --> 54:03.608
Where's Ozzie?

54:03.641 --> 54:05.910
I sent him to get
something out of the van.

54:05.943 --> 54:09.847
Listen, when you're
finished here, come on
over and root for Robert.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.889
[Mike]
You're just
a grunt working

54:18.923 --> 54:21.459
with illiterates,
amounting to nothing.

54:21.492 --> 54:23.594
[Nicole]
Another year
has come and gone,

54:23.628 --> 54:25.563
and you've done nothing.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.399
[Eddie]
You're one of those
95-percenters

54:28.433 --> 54:31.469
who never quite gives it
everything he's got.

54:34.639 --> 54:36.441
Okay, Jerry.

54:37.508 --> 54:39.477
[bell dings]

54:53.023 --> 54:56.026
Wow! Wow!
[shouting in Spanish]

54:59.964 --> 55:02.099
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Oh!

55:02.132 --> 55:04.735
[bell dings]

55:06.571 --> 55:08.573
[shouting]

55:08.606 --> 55:10.875
Hey, you there?
Pick up.

55:10.908 --> 55:12.910
I won all my fights.

55:15.780 --> 55:18.783
The only dicey
moment I had was
in the first fight,

55:18.816 --> 55:20.985
when the ringside doctor
almost stopped it

55:21.018 --> 55:24.655
because he said I had
dangerously high
levels of chi.

55:25.823 --> 55:28.893
[crowd cheering]

55:30.127 --> 55:32.397
I wish you
could've seen it.

55:32.430 --> 55:34.965
Are you sprinting--
Are you sprinting
to the phone?

55:34.999 --> 55:36.333
Can you hear me?

55:40.971 --> 55:42.840
[shouting, cheering]

55:42.873 --> 55:46.944
This is Jerry,
by the way.

55:46.977 --> 55:49.480
Hey, yo, hand me
your keys, man.
I'll drive.

55:49.514 --> 55:50.915
Ah, I don't mind.
I got it.

55:50.948 --> 55:52.950
No, I needed
my rest on the way
out here, dawg.

55:52.983 --> 55:55.386
I can drive back.
Hand me the keys.

55:55.420 --> 55:57.522
It's no problem.
I got it.

55:57.555 --> 55:59.089
It's like that, Jerr?

56:02.760 --> 56:05.696
Come on, man.
I got this, baby.

56:07.498 --> 56:09.166
[Jerry]
Hey, get around this guy.

56:09.199 --> 56:10.701
[Robert]
I didn't tell you
how to drive.

56:10.735 --> 56:13.070
That's 'cause I know
how to drive.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.905
Go, go, go.
Make this light.

56:14.939 --> 56:18.476
Hold up, man.
I know what I'm doing.

56:18.509 --> 56:21.846
[Jerry]
Hey, can you drop me off?
I'm going to rent a donkey.

56:30.488 --> 56:33.090
[police siren]

56:35.760 --> 56:38.796
Jerry. Wake up, man.

56:38.829 --> 56:39.797
What?

56:39.830 --> 56:40.831
Jerry, wake up.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.066
You gotta pull over.

56:42.099 --> 56:44.769
No, man, I can't.
Switch seats with me.

56:44.802 --> 56:46.737
Switch seats.
Are you high?
Pull over.

56:46.771 --> 56:48.839
Jerry, I got
warrants, okay?

56:48.873 --> 56:50.441
So what?
Pull over.

56:50.475 --> 56:51.776
I'm not taking
a ticket for you.

56:51.809 --> 56:53.077
Dude, the police
gonna pull us over,

56:53.110 --> 56:54.579
they gonna
impound the car.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.954
Officer, um, I don't know.

57:03.988 --> 57:05.990
I must've just had
highway hypnosis.

57:06.023 --> 57:08.826
Usually she'll start
to shimmy around 65

57:08.859 --> 57:10.561
and give me a little
heads up, you know.

57:10.595 --> 57:12.697
Tells me--
You were going 37.

57:12.730 --> 57:15.600
License and registration.

57:20.771 --> 57:23.474
License and
registration, please.

57:26.043 --> 57:28.145
You haven't been
drinking, have you?

57:28.178 --> 57:29.514
No.

57:29.547 --> 57:30.915
Let me tell you
why you're getting

57:30.948 --> 57:32.717
a citation this evening.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.852
Driving too slow

57:34.885 --> 57:38.022
can be just as dangerous
as driving too fast.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.858
Slow pokes like yourself

57:40.891 --> 57:45.129
place other drivers
in tight spots.

57:45.162 --> 57:47.698
You may think you were
being extra cautious,

57:47.732 --> 57:50.768
but actually, you're putting
everyone else in jeopardy.

57:50.801 --> 57:54.104
Imagine a large boulder
sitting in the middle

57:54.138 --> 57:55.940
of a travel lane
on a dark highway,

57:55.973 --> 57:57.508
and you might
just get an idea

57:57.542 --> 57:59.910
of how dangerous this
kind of driving can be.

58:02.813 --> 58:05.983
There you are.

58:06.016 --> 58:08.218
Let's not let this
happen again.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.691
And listen,
this is the highway.

58:13.724 --> 58:15.125
This is for the big boys.

58:15.159 --> 58:18.062
If you can't handle it,
with all due respect,

58:18.095 --> 58:19.764
stick to the side streets.

58:19.797 --> 58:21.966
You have a good night.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.707
37.

58:31.909 --> 58:33.110
37.

58:35.245 --> 58:38.749
We're going 35 now,
and we're not moving!

58:38.783 --> 58:40.685
Hold on, let me
do some rough math!

58:40.718 --> 58:42.987
We'll be back in L.A.
in nine months!

58:43.020 --> 58:45.155
Or should we just
stay here in neutral

58:45.189 --> 58:47.592
and hope that the Earth
just comes around.

58:47.625 --> 58:49.760
L.A. will just come
around underneath us.

58:49.794 --> 58:52.763
My walk to the van
was faster than 37.

58:52.797 --> 58:55.666
What are we, like
20 feet from Phoenix?

58:55.700 --> 58:58.636
37!

58:58.669 --> 59:02.807
Do you understand glaciers
are kicking our ass?

59:02.840 --> 59:05.743
So Robert hits this guy
in the ribs so hard,

59:05.776 --> 59:09.246
I actually hear
cracking come from
the guy's midsection.

59:09.279 --> 59:13.618
And then Victor breaks
a guy's nose wide open,

59:13.651 --> 59:15.119
so it's like a--
It's a blood bath.

59:15.152 --> 59:16.821
Sounds like
a lot of fun.

59:16.854 --> 59:18.288
Yeah, it's good times.

59:18.322 --> 59:19.289
Yeah.

59:19.323 --> 59:21.025
[Eddie]
Good, good, good!

59:21.058 --> 59:22.326
Way to go.
All right.

59:22.359 --> 59:23.728
Atta boy, Victor!

59:23.761 --> 59:24.962
All right.

59:26.330 --> 59:28.966
Why do men need
to punch each other
in the face?

59:28.999 --> 59:30.267
'Cause they deduct points

59:30.300 --> 59:31.936
if we punch each other
in the balls.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.103
Oh, I see.

59:34.805 --> 59:35.973
You got it?

59:36.006 --> 59:37.808
Oh!

59:41.011 --> 59:43.113
No, no, I got it.
I got it.

59:43.147 --> 59:47.184
Let's review.
Smart, good looking,
non-smoker.

59:47.217 --> 59:49.186
Shouldn't you
be married by now?

59:49.219 --> 59:50.888
I am married.

59:50.921 --> 59:53.190
To my work.

59:57.327 --> 01:00:00.164
Was that to me?

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:02.232
Any chance you two
will get a divorce?

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.636
No, not for you.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:08.038
I'd like to start
seeing your work.

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:10.908
I've always been
attracted to your job.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.009
[giggles]

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.343
Does your job
ever talk about me?

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:32.096
I could stare
at this forever.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.398
Me, too.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.834
Are you hungry?

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:37.868
Yeah.

01:00:37.902 --> 01:00:38.969
Let's go.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.370
My ass is asleep.

01:00:40.404 --> 01:00:42.006
[laughs]

01:00:45.843 --> 01:00:48.378
No offense, but I think you
should fire your gardener.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:50.280
I mean,
this is like

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.249
the surface
of the moon out here.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.886
I've been offered a job.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.221
In real estate law.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:59.890
Great.
That's fantastic.

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:01.759
You know what, I didn't
want to say anything,

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.161
but get out of that
public defender's office.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.831
What do you need
with the crackheads
and the pedophiles.

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.866
It's in Seattle.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:11.969
So you're just
gonna turn your back
on your clients.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.104
I'm flying up tomorrow
to meet with the partners.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:16.974
I'm weighing my options
a little bit.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.376
You know what the annual
rainfall is in Seattle?

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:20.477
A lot.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.412
Yes, it real--

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:25.415
It's underwater
like nine months
out of the year.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.819
You'd essentially
be moving into
an aquarium.

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:30.788
You wanna live
in that castle

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:32.923
with the bubbles coming
out of the chimney?

01:01:32.957 --> 01:01:35.059
It's a lot more money.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.727
What about
the tar pits?

01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:37.928
Your beloved tar pits.

01:01:37.962 --> 01:01:41.098
You think they have
tar pits in Seattle?

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:44.268
No, they don't
have big holes
filled with tar.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.003
That's--
That's us, baby.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.137
That's L.A.

01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:48.739
Look, I'm not
a 24-year old idealist

01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:50.340
fresh out of law school
anymore, you know?

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.309
I mean, it's
a really good firm.

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:58.916
Well, I guess you
should check it out.

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:02.086
I'm probably not
the guy to be giving
out career advice.

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:10.027
Was that the grill?

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:19.970
Hey, Jerry, man,
wait up.

01:02:20.004 --> 01:02:22.840
Hey, uh, I just wanted
to thank you again

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:25.042
for helping me
back there at the van.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:26.210
You did me a solid.

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:27.945
Yeah. You know
what that ticket's

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.880
gonna do to my rates?

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:32.817
I mean,
if I had car insurance?

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.351
Hey, Jerry, man,
hold up.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:36.286
I got something else
to tell you.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.023
What's going on?

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:41.959
Coach Bell's not being
straight up with you.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:44.494
What do you mean?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.532
Sparring partner?

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.400
And a damn good one, too.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.468
You know how much better

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.038
Robert's gotten
working with you?

01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:56.440
[scoffs]

01:02:56.473 --> 01:03:00.144
I didn't sign up
to be someone's
sparring partner.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.312
Hey, you ate a lot
of leather in Phoenix.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:04.815
We're moving up in class now.
You could really get hurt.

01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:07.852
I knocked out
Darius Reece in Phoenix.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.054
Hey, who are we kidding?

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.355
That was a fluke.

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:15.092
You had the key
to his roller skates.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.526
Look, the point is

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.929
I gotta choose my date
for the prom,

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.430
and it's Robert.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.400
I can't take you both.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.909
Where we working?
Where are we working?

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:07.111
Get in the truck,
I'll tell you en route.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.578
Covert ops, baby.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.349
When you talk to Mike?

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:13.617
I talked to
Mike yesterday.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.052
He said it's cool.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:16.887
Come on, she gets back
tomorrow night.

01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:18.022
We're up against
the clock, buddy.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.623
Let's go.
We'll never finish.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:22.159
We'll never finish
with that attitude.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.260
Now, come one.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.129
You bring
the 16-penny nails?

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.396
You didn't tell
to me nothing.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.899
You can't think of
anything on your own?

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:54.091
What are you building?

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:57.627
Storage shed.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.330
What are you
siding it with?

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.298
T-111.

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:02.399
T-111.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.134
You gotta be careful
with that T-111.

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:06.070
You wanna get
the margins right, you know.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.072
They have a T&G joint.
Wanna get it just right.

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:11.575
If by T&G you mean
tongue and groove,
you're wrong.

01:05:11.608 --> 01:05:13.477
The T-111 has
a shiplap seam.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.413
I'm pretty sure it's T&G.
I've worked with it a lot.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:18.682
No. No.
It's shiplap.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.487
Well, let's talk
foundation bolting.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.589
What are you holding the bottom
plate down to the slab with.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:26.723
Redheads.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.258
Oh, you're going
with wedge anchors.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:29.459
Yeah, I'd go
with J bolts.

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:31.128
I'd put 'em in
when the slab was wet.

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:33.397
That way, I wouldn't
have to bust out
the roto hammer.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.665
Well, if I was going
with the footing,
I'd use the J bolts,

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:37.734
but we have
a 4-inch slab, so--

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.104
Cut corners,
people get hurt.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.638
It's a tool shed.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.507
It's not an underground
parking structure.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:46.143
Okay. We're in
earthquake country.

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:48.045
I don't know if you heard.

01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:50.447
So what you
building your man?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.082
Uh, a deck.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:53.383
Oh, that's sweet.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:54.651
A deck, right?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.086
No, I'm not building it.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.121
You're not building it?

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.322
I'm building a deck,
but not--

01:05:58.355 --> 01:06:00.024
I'm not building
a deck for him.
No.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:01.225
I'm building
a deck for my lady.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.426
Oh, for your lady.
Yeah.

01:06:02.459 --> 01:06:04.161
What you screwing it
off with, deckers?

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.530
No, using 16-penny
galvanized common heads.

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:08.698
Oh, you get a hell of
a lot more grab

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.135
with a core-stripped
bugle head zinc
drywall screw.

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:13.603
I hit .690 in the Van Nuys
Unlimited Arc League.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:16.473
All-American,
Arizona state.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.010
Ozzie.
Yeah?

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:22.379
Let's get those uh--
Let's get those drywall
screws.

01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:24.781
And let's go.
March now.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:28.218
6,500 more washers,
and we're on deck.

01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:30.187
[hammers pounding]

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:36.193
[electric saw whirring]

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:48.138
She lands in 34 minutes.

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:49.339
And more.

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:52.142
Hey, don't tell anyone
about this part.

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:09.726
* You are so

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:13.730
* Beautiful

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.365
* You are

01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:18.702
* I want you to know

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.805
* I won't let it go

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.608
* I won't let it sleep

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:27.811
* Any day of the week

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:30.514
* I should not talk

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.850
* But I would like to say

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.121
* I want you to know

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:40.324
* I want you to stay

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:44.261
* Here, please

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:07.151
You're a piece
of work, Ferro.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:08.585
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:10.187
Hey, happy to see me?

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.323
Hey, Mike, listen,
you owed me and Ozzie

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:14.691
two and a half
days pay.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.193
That should've more
than covered the price

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.327
of that windshield.

01:08:17.361 --> 01:08:18.761
Yeah, yeah, but
I get to work today,

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.430
and I see that
some assholes
helped themselves

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:22.832
to a big old
pile of wood.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.768
Wasn't me.

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:26.502
Hold him still.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.372
Now, you tell me
where you stashed it,

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:31.241
or I'm slamming this door
on the count of three.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.475
Mike, don't show off.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:33.710
One--
Come on, Mike.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.645
Two--
Seriously, Mike.
Come on.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.281
Excuse me.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.819
Problem?

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.523
You're still dropping
your right a little

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.425
when you throw your left.

01:08:49.393 --> 01:08:50.694
You don't need Bell.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.828
Jerry, you can
go on your own.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:55.732
Trainers don't qualify
for the Olympics, boxers do.

01:08:57.434 --> 01:08:58.635
I don't know.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.837
Maybe he's right.
I think he's right.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.506
So that's it.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:05.175
You gotta worry about
yourself now, man.

01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:07.211
Bell reigns you in.
You gotta let your hands go.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.778
Come on, Jerry, man.
Don't change the subject.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.747
I'm just saying,
you got a lot of ability.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.850
You gotta think
about your pro career.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:17.787
I actually think
you're relieved
you don't have to go.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:26.529
Could I just--
Do you have taquitos?

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:29.533
[Woman]
No, no tequila.
Only sodas.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:30.466
No, taquitos.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.736
Eh?
Taquitos.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:34.571
Taquito?

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.474
Look, if you said spaghetti,
I wouldn't be confused.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.908
Taquito.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.511
And then he hit me
with two lefts

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:42.746
and a huge right,

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.413
and then I realize

01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:46.515
how do I know
the guy beating
the crap out of me

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.417
is actually gay?

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:50.754
'Cause no one else
would be stupid enough

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:52.256
to pretend they were gay

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.391
to enter
a boxing tournament.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.460
Or would they?

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.395
What better way
for a homophobe

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:00.196
to legally gay bash?

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:05.269
Jeff, do you think you're
a victim of a hate crime?

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:07.537
Possibly.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.282
Hey.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:21.818
Hey.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:24.488
That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.356
By far.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.924
Well, you deserve it.

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:31.928
I should've told you
I rent that place.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:37.734
Well, I got a break
on the lumber, so--

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.969
How's the training coming?

01:10:40.003 --> 01:10:44.040
Uh, I'm not.
I mean, I'm not gonna go.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:47.344
Why? You worked so hard.

01:10:47.377 --> 01:10:51.581
It's-- It's just
not in my DNA.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:54.884
Don't tell me you're
playing Atari again.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:57.954
No, no.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.691
What's happening with Seattle?

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:05.362
I, um--

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:06.930
I have to take it.

01:11:06.963 --> 01:11:10.334
It's just too good
to pass up.

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:12.602
I, um--

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:16.740
I gotta go.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:29.919
I know it's no great digs,
but it's a week's work.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.488
We'll be fine.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:34.057
When I live in Nicaragua,

01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:37.461
the civil war--
Sandinistas, Contras--

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.062
I come here
for opportunity.

01:11:39.095 --> 01:11:41.097
Well, in about
five minutes,

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.000
you're gonna get
an opportunity to
form some trenches.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.703
You have
opportunity, Jerry.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.772
Fight for your country.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.107
Fight for yourself.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.742
[sighs]

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:55.044
I gotta get suck
off the hose.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:58.582
* Where have
all my friends gone? *

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:01.718
* They've all disappeared

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:05.655
* Turn around maybe one day

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:08.925
* You're all that was there

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.596
* Stood by unbelieving

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:15.765
* Stood by on my own

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:19.903
* Always thought
I was someone *

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:22.872
* Turned out I was wrong

01:12:24.408 --> 01:12:27.644
* You brought me through

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:31.047
* And you made me feel

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.017
* So good

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:38.722
* Why don't you
stay behind? *

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:41.090
* So good

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.827
* Why don't you stop?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.897
* Look at what's going down

01:13:16.593 --> 01:13:20.530
* [rock]

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:26.736
Come on!

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:30.874
Come on!

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:34.578
[grunting]

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:38.214
* Now here I go

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.216
* Hope I don't break down

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.452
* I won't take anything

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:44.521
* I don't need anything

01:13:44.554 --> 01:13:46.155
* I want to kill you

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.957
* Upon the altar

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:50.059
* You and me

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:53.930
* You and me

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.931
Come on!

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.933
[grunting]

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.870
[bag crashes to floor]

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:06.776
Who hangs a heavy bag
with toggle bolts?

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:37.073
Looks like I won't
be seeing you
till the finals.

01:14:37.106 --> 01:14:39.776
Hi, Jerry.
What's happenin', man?

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:42.546
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be there.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:48.217
[Announcer]
Another clinic
by Robert Brown.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:52.522
Victor Padilla with
a narrow victory.

01:14:52.556 --> 01:14:53.723
Yeah!

01:14:53.757 --> 01:14:57.060
And Jerry Ferro's
remarkable run continues.

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.696
Ferro advances
to the semis.

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:02.832
A heartbreaking loss
for young Victor Padilla.

01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:05.101
Brown breezes
into the semis.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:06.903
Brown!
Ferro!

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:08.805
Ferro!
Brown!

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.240
Jerry Ferro will
join Robert Brown

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:14.844
in the light
heavyweight finals.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:21.217
Jerry told me that
even Mike Tyson lost
an Olympic qualifier.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.554
It's true.

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:27.591
He also said that
I have a bright future.

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.559
You should listen to him.

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:32.228
I mean a guy that old
with arms that skinny, man,

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.932
that punch that hard,
he gotta know something.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:42.606
I pray for you
both tonight.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.708
Thanks, brother.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.750
[sighs]

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.885
Ozzie, it's time.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:03.927
Come on, Ponch.

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:09.298
I make it for you.

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:11.701
Thanks, brother.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:28.985
[Announcer]
And now, we move on to
the light heavyweight final

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:31.287
between young Robert Brown,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.256
one of the most
promising amateurs

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:34.824
in recent history,

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:37.026
and the 40-year-old
Jerry Ferro,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.895
nicknamed the Hammer

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:42.065
no doubt because he's
a fulltime carpenter.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.667
[crowd cheering, applauding]

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:51.708
These are two boxers at the
opposite ends of their careers.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:54.844
For Ferro, it's
a last shot at glory.

01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:58.047
And for Brown, it could
be a step on the road

01:16:58.081 --> 01:17:02.351
to Olympic champion, and
maybe even world champion.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:14.630
Hey, Jerry.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.372
Thanks, buddy.
That's sweet.

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:24.808
Hey, man, from her.

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:27.376
She. Lindsay.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.896
What's up, Eddie?

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:49.265
Listen, no quick
triggers tonight, okay?

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.167
My kid can take a punch.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.237
Let's let it
go to the cards.

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.707
This one's scheduled
for four rounds of boxing.

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:59.442
But Ferro has yet
to have a fight

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.978
here at the trials
go to the judges.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.379
Touch gloves.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:07.717
You ready?
You ready?

01:18:07.751 --> 01:18:09.385
Box!

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:20.864
And right from the outset,

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:23.266
the younger fighter looks
like the quicker fighter.

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:27.837
Box.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:40.383
Brown scoring at will
with the jab.

01:18:42.819 --> 01:18:44.153
Jerry, Jerry, move!

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:46.189
[bell dings]

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:49.158
Brown is building an
impressive early lead.

01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:52.195
Beautiful, babe.
Beautiful.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:54.363
I don't feel like
I'm hurting him.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.765
You're winning the fight.

01:18:55.799 --> 01:18:58.367
That's all you gotta
worry about.

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.937
Hey, Jerry,
go for the body.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:04.808
Only this way
for him breaking nose.

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:07.110
I think he said
to work the body.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:09.779
And that actually
makes sense.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:11.247
Hey, I learn
from the best, man.

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:19.288
Both fighters
working outside again.

01:19:22.058 --> 01:19:23.993
Ferro trying to make
a move to the body,

01:19:24.027 --> 01:19:27.063
but, oh, that right
and left combination
did connect.

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.067
And down goes Ferro!

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.969
This could be it.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:38.241
--two, three, four, five,

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:41.477
six, seven, eight.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:45.114
And Ferro makes it
to his feet.

01:19:45.148 --> 01:19:46.115
[bell dings]

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:49.085
Just as the round ends.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.453
[chuckles]

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.424
You gotta knock
him out, Jerry.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:56.592
You need
to knock him out.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.161
Oh, you want me
to knock him out,

01:19:58.194 --> 01:19:59.462
you should've said
something earlier.

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:01.097
I would've done it
in the first round.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.167
Listen, you stay away
from this guy

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.003
for four minutes,
and you're going
to the Olympics.

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:08.437
Now, get on your bicycle.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:10.439
He's too old
and too slow to catch you.

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:12.475
What hand would
you like me to use?

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.410
Whatever, you know?
You gotta knock him out, man.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.045
I don't know,
I go right, I go left.

01:20:16.079 --> 01:20:17.881
I tell you what,
I'll surprise you,
okay?

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:19.115
How about that?
Okay, man.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.850
On your bicycle.

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:23.953
[bell dings]

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:26.422
And we're ready
for round three.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:35.932
With a big lead
and two rounds to go,

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.600
young Robert Brown
is putting

01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:39.903
his foot speed
on full display,

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:41.871
content to make
his older opponent

01:20:41.905 --> 01:20:44.207
chase him
around the ring.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:45.541
[crowd booing]

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.377
The crowd may not like it,

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:51.314
but Brown is dancing
his way to the Olympics.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.449
[makes chicken noises]

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.456
[continues chicken noises]

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:08.497
And-- Oh!
Here comes Brown again,

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:11.234
scoring with a right,
left combination.
Keep moving.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:12.936
Keep moving!

01:21:16.405 --> 01:21:20.176
And Ferro lands
a big overhand left

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.045
just as the round
comes to an end.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:23.980
What the hell
are you doing?

01:21:24.013 --> 01:21:26.649
He can't hurt me.
I can beat him.

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:29.518
You already have.
No stay away from him,
God damn it.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:32.688
I didn't get in boxing
to run from people.

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.957
You do what I tell ya.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:35.558
Now you get your hands up,

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:36.592
and get your elbows in,

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.361
and stay away
from this guy

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.163
for two minutes,
you got that?

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:47.103
On my card, Brown
is way ahead on points.

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:50.473
It's gonna take
a knockout from Ferro
to win this fight.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.909
Last round.
Touch 'em up.

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:58.414
You gonna run this round?
I'm through runnin'.

01:21:58.447 --> 01:21:59.482
Box.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:00.683
[bell dings]

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:04.553
And we're ready for the
fourth and final round.

01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:11.294
It looks like Brown's
dancing days are over,

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:13.496
as he moves in
for the knockout.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.402
Holy cow!

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:22.038
Brown is a man possessed.

01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:23.306
Ferro is taking
his best shots.

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:25.574
Break! Break!
No pushing!

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.110
Box.

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:29.678
Robert, stay away from him.
Stay away from him.

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:37.386
Two hard lefts to the head!

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:42.525
Another one!
And Ferro has hurt Brown.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:45.494
God damn it, kid!
Get out of there!

01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:50.133
Brown is hurt.
Up against the ropes.

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:53.036
Brown appears to be
out on his feet.

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:55.604
Don't stop it!
Do not stop it!

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:23.666
[bell dings]

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:26.435
And it's over!

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:31.107
It looks like Robert Brown
is going to the Olympics.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.742
Jerry Ferro practically
held him up.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:42.251
Why don't you listen
to me, kid?

01:23:42.285 --> 01:23:44.320
'Cause I don't need you.

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.722
Oh, is that so?

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:49.558
Well, you're gonna find out
who needs who around here,

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:52.027
small-time punk.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:07.410
[crowd cheers]

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:13.082
[crowd cheers louder]

01:24:13.116 --> 01:24:14.650
He the champion!
I know, man!

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:17.586
I talk to you, man!
I talk to you!

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:22.758
I guess you miss
your crackheads, huh?

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:25.128
Just my boxing instructor.

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:35.138
Lindsay! You back!

01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:38.274
When you leave,
Jerry cried like the baby.

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:39.308
Thanks, buddy.

01:24:39.342 --> 01:24:40.476
Huh?

01:24:43.379 --> 01:24:44.813
Why'd you hold back?

01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:46.515
Affirmative action.

01:24:46.549 --> 01:24:48.484
I figured it was your
arthritis acting up.

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:51.387
You're going to
the Olympics, baby.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.556
Yeah, but I'm going
to need a trainer.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.724
All right, I accept.

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.760
No, you got
Ozzie's number?

01:24:57.793 --> 01:24:59.395
Oh, that's great.
[laughs]

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:00.463
That is good stuff.

01:25:00.496 --> 01:25:02.131
You're gonna
love Beijing.

01:25:02.165 --> 01:25:05.168
None of the rickshaws
go over 37 miles an hour.

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:08.404
* [mariachi]

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.143
[chatter]

01:25:14.177 --> 01:25:16.679
[Jerry]
We break ground on Monday.

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:19.415
Steve says when we're finished
we can use his place.

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.749
That's great.

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:23.252
Are you going to have
spinning classes?

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:25.521
No. No. This is
a boxing gym.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.523
I'm saying,
but spinning classes
have the finest women.

01:25:27.556 --> 01:25:28.591
They be--

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:30.159
Yeah, Robert,
you shouldn't even

01:25:30.193 --> 01:25:33.196
be thinking about women
until after the Olympics.

01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:37.166
Let me tell you guys about
a circulating life energy

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.567
known as chi.

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:39.568
Cheese?

01:25:39.602 --> 01:25:41.304
Chi.

01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:43.572
So close.
Chi.

01:25:43.606 --> 01:25:44.940
It's very important.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.476
Yeah, you don't
melt it on chips.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:50.413
A great lady,
a loyal best friend,

01:25:50.446 --> 01:25:51.847
two promising boxers,

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.782
and my own gym
to train them in.

01:25:53.816 --> 01:25:57.320
Now that sounds like
a dream come true.

01:25:57.353 --> 01:25:58.854
[Ozzie]
Are you going
to cry again?

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.589
[Jerry]
I wasn't crying.

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:01.590
I see you!

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:03.459
I had sawdust in my eye.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.727
You liar!

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.462
Why do you have
to bust my chops?

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.730
You cry-baby.

01:26:07.763 --> 01:26:09.865
What, that makes me
less of a man?

01:26:09.898 --> 01:26:11.834
Lindsay, he cry!

01:26:16.439 --> 01:26:19.808
* Life

01:26:19.842 --> 01:26:24.980
* Story of my life

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:29.618
* Well, high school
seemed like such a blur *

01:26:29.652 --> 01:26:31.887
* I didn't have
much interest *

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.257
* In sports
or school elections *

01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:37.626
* And in class
I dreamed all day *

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.296
* About a rock 'n' roll
weekend *

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:43.266
* Oh

01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:47.803
* And the girl in the front
of the room *

01:26:47.836 --> 01:26:49.672
* So close yet so far

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:52.375
* You know she never
seemed to notice *

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:56.011
* This silly
school-boy crush *

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.447
* Wasn't just pretend

01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:01.684
* Oh

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:05.888
* Life goes by so fast

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:10.726
* You only want to do
what you think is right *

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:14.463
* Close your eyes,
then it's past *

01:27:14.497 --> 01:27:19.335
* Story of my life

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:21.604
* Story of my life

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:23.739
* La la huh huh

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:28.944
* Story of my life

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:33.749
* And I went down
to my old neighborhood *

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.651
* The faces have
all changed *

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:38.387
* There's no one there
left to talk to *

01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:41.824
* And the pool hall
that I loved as a kid *

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:44.560
* Is now a 7-Eleven

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:47.463
* Oh

01:27:47.496 --> 01:27:52.067
* And I went downtown
to look for a job *

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:56.672
* I had no training,
no experience to speak of *

01:27:56.705 --> 01:28:00.309
* And I looked at
the holes in my jeans *

01:28:00.343 --> 01:28:02.745
* And I turned
and headed back *

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:06.048
* Oh

01:28:06.081 --> 01:28:10.553
* Life goes by so fast

01:28:10.586 --> 01:28:15.324
* You only want to do
what you think is right *

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:18.794
* Close your eyes,
then it's past *

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:23.732
* Story of my life

01:28:23.766 --> 01:28:25.968
* Story of my life

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:28.404
* La la huh huh

01:28:28.437 --> 01:28:33.509
* Story of my life

01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:24.560
* And good times come
and good times go *

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:29.432
* I only wish the good times
would last a little longer *

01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:32.868
* I think about
the good times we had *

01:29:32.901 --> 01:29:35.471
* And why they had to end

01:29:35.504 --> 01:29:38.541
* Oh

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:43.178
* So I sit at the edge
of my bed *

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.514
* I strum my guitar

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:48.050
* And I sing
an outlaw love song *

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:51.420
* I think about
what you're doin' now *

01:29:51.454 --> 01:29:54.056
* And when you're
coming back *

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:57.560
* Oh

01:29:57.593 --> 01:30:01.964
* Life goes by so fast

01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:06.669
* You only want to do
what you think is right *

01:30:06.702 --> 01:30:10.172
* Close your eyes,
then it's past *

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:14.743
* Story of my life

01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:19.515
* Story of my life

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:21.817
* Story of my life

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.052
* La la da da

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:29.424
* Story of my life

01:30:33.996 --> 01:30:35.030
[crowd cheering]

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:36.031
So you're just
gonna turn your back
on your clients.

01:30:36.064 --> 01:30:36.865
I'm flying up tomorrow
to meet with the partners.

01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:37.866
I'm weighing my options
a little bit.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.166
You know what the annual
rainfall is in Seattle?

01:30:39.201 --> 01:30:39.602
A lot.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:40.636
Yes, it real--

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:41.704
It's underwater
like nine months
out of the year.

01:30:41.737 --> 01:30:42.437
You'd essentially
be moving into
an aquarium.

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:43.438
You wanna live
in that castle

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:45.173
with the bubbles coming
out of the chimney?

01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:45.841
It's a lot more money.

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:46.408
What about
the tar pits?

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:47.275
Your beloved tar pits.

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:48.243
You think they have
tar pits in Seattle?

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:48.844
No, they don't
have big holes
filled with tar.

01:30:48.877 --> 01:30:50.245
That's--
That's us, baby.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.046
That's L.A.

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:51.947
Look, I'm not
a 24-year old idealist

01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:52.681
fresh out of law school
anymore, you know?

01:30:52.715 --> 01:30:52.748
I mean, it's
a really good firm.

01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:55.684
Well, I guess you
should check it out.

01:30:55.718 --> 01:30:55.751
I'm probably not
the guy to be giving
out career advice.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:56.318
Was that the grill?

01:30:56.919 --> 01:30:57.820
Hey, Jerry, man,
wait up.

01:30:57.853 --> 01:30:58.687
Hey, uh, I just wanted
to thank you again

01:30:58.721 --> 01:30:59.221
for helping me
back there at the van.

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:01.156
You did me a solid.

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.690
Yeah. You know
what that ticket's

01:31:01.724 --> 01:31:02.424
gonna do to my rates?

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:03.025
I mean,
if I had car insurance?

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:03.759
Hey, Jerry, man,
hold up.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:04.192
I got something else
to tell you.

01:31:04.226 --> 01:31:06.194
What's going on?

01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:06.261
Coach Bell's not being
straight up with you.

01:31:06.729 --> 01:31:06.762
What do you mean?

01:31:07.262 --> 01:31:07.830
Sparring partner?

01:31:07.863 --> 01:31:08.396
And a damn good one, too.

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:09.164
You know how much better

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:09.498
Robert's gotten
working with you?

01:31:09.532 --> 01:31:11.667
[scoffs]

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.535
I didn't sign up
to be someone's
sparring partner.

01:31:12.568 --> 01:31:13.669
Hey, you ate a lot
of leather in Phoenix.

01:31:13.702 --> 01:31:14.503
We're moving up in class now.
You could really get hurt.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:15.070
I knocked out
Darius Reece in Phoenix.

01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:16.739
Hey, who are we kidding?

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:17.573
That was a fluke.

01:31:17.606 --> 01:31:18.040
You had the key
to his roller skates.

01:31:18.073 --> 01:31:18.841
Look, the point is

01:31:18.874 --> 01:31:19.274
I gotta choose my date
for the prom,

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:19.808
and it's Robert.

01:31:19.842 --> 01:31:19.875
I can't take you both.

01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:22.711
Where we working?
Where are we working?

01:31:22.745 --> 01:31:23.211
Get in the truck,
I'll tell you en route.

01:31:23.245 --> 01:31:23.278
Covert ops, baby.

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:24.513
When you talk to Mike?

01:31:24.547 --> 01:31:25.013
I talked to
Mike yesterday.

01:31:25.047 --> 01:31:25.914
He said it's cool.

01:31:25.948 --> 01:31:27.750
Come on, she gets back
tomorrow night.

01:31:27.783 --> 01:31:28.483
We're up against
the clock, buddy.

01:31:28.517 --> 01:31:29.384
Let's go.
We'll never finish.

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:29.818
We'll never finish
with that attitude.

01:31:29.852 --> 01:31:30.586
Now, come one.

01:31:30.619 --> 01:31:31.286
You bring
the 16-penny nails?

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.421
You didn't tell
to me nothing.

01:31:33.455 --> 01:31:33.488
You can't think of
anything on your own?

01:31:34.056 --> 01:31:34.089
What are you building?

01:31:34.523 --> 01:31:35.157
Storage shed.

01:31:35.190 --> 01:31:35.457
What are you
siding it with?

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:35.724
T-111.

01:31:35.758 --> 01:31:36.525
T-111.

01:31:36.559 --> 01:31:38.426
You gotta be careful
with that T-111.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:38.927
You wanna get
the margins right, you know.
