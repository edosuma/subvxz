We didn't know. Can you ever forgive us?

There's nothing to forgive.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.428
Coco Village is my home.

Then it's our turn to sacrifice.
We're done living in fear.

You might not think it's a pleasure

I have received word

Yes, an unfortunate incident.

I assure you,
we have the situation under control.

We also have word
that Arlong and his fishmen

across these islands.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.806

- No.

- Cadets.
- That's not possible.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.154
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.865
Luffy would never do anything like that.

How dare you accuse me?
I am a Marine captain.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.560
Be a good Marine.

33:42.895 --> 33:43.896
Be a good pirate.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.712
[chuckles]

34:07.712 --> 34:08.755
Ah!

34:11.007 --> 34:11.841
Guys!

34:13.134 --> 34:13.968
Check it out.

34:21.684 --> 34:24.187
Hey, look. I'm famous!

34:24.187 --> 34:26.314
What are you on about?
That's Luffy's wanted poster.

34:26.314 --> 34:27.857
Not just Luffy.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.903
[chuckles]

34:31.903 --> 34:35.281
Sorry, guys. Maybe if you work
a little harder, you'll get a bounty too.

34:35.281 --> 34:36.532
That doesn't count.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.951
It's okay to be jealous.
Feel what you need to feel.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.203
I... mmm...

34:40.203 --> 34:42.789
- This is stupid.
- This is gonna make things much harder.

34:44.332 --> 34:46.918
With that price on your head,
every bounty hunter in the East Blue

34:46.918 --> 34:48.044
will be gunning for you.

34:48.044 --> 34:50.755
Not just Luffy.
They're gonna be gunning for all of us.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.218
Then it's a good thing
we're not staying in the East Blue.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.642
We're going to the Grand Line.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.394
[adventurous music plays]

35:39.220 --> 35:40.221
Oh, Usopp.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.452
[laughs]

36:04.495 --> 36:05.913
Thirty million?

36:05.913 --> 36:08.499
[laughs]

36:09.917 --> 36:12.920
I'll kill the little shit myself.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.547
[Alvida] If you don't, I will.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.565
[chuckles]

36:33.900 --> 36:35.818
A hell of a first bounty.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.906
I guess there is
some of me in him after all.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.823
[Koby] Sir?

36:44.702 --> 36:46.412
I don't regret my actions.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.789
I'm ready to accept my punishment.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.168
Yes. Me too.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.631
Following orders
doesn't make you a good Marine.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.967
It's following your code.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.136
All men have their own brand of justice,

37:02.970 --> 37:05.890
and you both followed yours, so well done.

37:08.809 --> 37:11.479
So you're not going to punish us?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.022
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.526
My training methods have been called
the worst kind of punishment.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.197
So...

37:23.324 --> 37:24.367
you think you're up for it?

37:24.367 --> 37:26.369
You're gonna train us yourself?

37:27.203 --> 37:30.206
Well, you want to get stronger, don't you?
Learn how to fight?

37:31.540 --> 37:32.375
Yes, sir.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.796
I wanna be worthy of holding my own
against someone like Luffy.

37:36.796 --> 37:37.880
[Garp] Huh.

37:42.468 --> 37:44.762
And you, what do you want?

37:44.762 --> 37:45.972
I want to show people

37:45.972 --> 37:49.517
that Roronoa Zoro isn't the only one
that knows how to use swords.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.270
I want to get stronger too.

37:52.895 --> 37:53.813
Like my friend.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.524
Or whatever.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.363
Maybe the old chef was right.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.366
It <i>is</i> your turn.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.370
Your training begins tomorrow.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.330
Dismissed.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.306
This is an unusual place
for a man of your stature.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.269
Come on, lads.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.439
We're in the presence
of a mighty Warlord of the Sea.

38:36.939 --> 38:40.151
Show a little... [grunts] ...respect.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.573
Afraid I'm not in the mood
for a duel today, Hawk Eyes.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.201
- I'm a wee bit hungover.
- I'm not here to fight.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.079
Not when you're half the man
you used to be.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.332
I could still take you.

38:55.708 --> 39:00.046
- And with one arm tied behind my back.
- [laughing]

39:02.798 --> 39:06.052
I recently ran into someone
who might be of interest to you.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.888
A boy you mentioned long ago.

39:15.644 --> 39:16.479
Luffy!

39:17.438 --> 39:18.522
[chuckles]

39:18.522 --> 39:19.690
He really did it.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.402
No way. It's Luffy. He's a pirate!

39:23.402 --> 39:24.445
He's a captain!

39:24.445 --> 39:26.030
[all laugh]

39:26.030 --> 39:27.573
I guess we better watch our backs.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.657
[all laugh]

39:28.657 --> 39:30.785
Bring out the reserve booze, boys!

39:30.785 --> 39:32.328
I thought you were hungover.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.412
[Shanks] Oh, lighten up,

39:33.412 --> 39:35.998
you somber old son of a gun.
Drink with us.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.626
I suppose a drink wouldn't hurt.

39:38.626 --> 39:42.088
- This is cause to celebrate!
- [pirates] Yeah!

39:43.756 --> 39:45.049
[Luffy] <i>So what do you think?</i>

39:51.305 --> 39:53.682
It's a little piece of home
to take with you on our journey.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.227
And I can whip up tangerine tarts
anytime you want.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.312
[emotional music plays]

40:10.783 --> 40:11.700
It's perfect.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.167
We actually have something for you too.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.295
Usopp, set the main!

40:24.088 --> 40:25.756
[Usopp] Setting the main.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.927
[adventurous music plays]

40:55.828 --> 40:58.080
Whoo-hoo!

40:58.080 --> 40:58.998
Whoa!

40:58.998 --> 41:00.875
[Nami and Sanji chuckle]

41:00.875 --> 41:03.502
Whoo!

41:04.128 --> 41:06.046
Yeah! Hoo-hoo!

41:07.715 --> 41:09.008
Wha!

41:09.008 --> 41:10.092
Yah!

41:10.885 --> 41:13.179
The entrance to the Grand Line
isn't too far off,

41:13.179 --> 41:16.640
but I think there's a mistake on the map.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.892
[Luffy] What do you mean?

41:17.892 --> 41:22.521
[Nami] Well, it looks like a river
or a canal or something,

41:22.521 --> 41:24.356
but it doesn't make any sense.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.442
These elevations show a mountain.

41:26.442 --> 41:28.402
I mean, how can a river go up a mountain?

41:29.570 --> 41:30.863
You're our navigator.

41:31.780 --> 41:32.990
You'll figure it out.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.033
[Sanji] Hey, Luffy!

41:35.910 --> 41:37.703
Come here. I've got an idea.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.216
Straw Hats!

41:51.091 --> 41:53.761
All hands on deck for a cast-off ceremony.

41:57.431 --> 41:58.432
[grunts]

42:07.149 --> 42:08.526
I'm gonna find the All Blue.

42:12.947 --> 42:13.781
Ah!

42:14.365 --> 42:16.325
I'm gonna be King of the Pirates.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.332
I'm gonna be
the world's greatest swordsman.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.463
I'm gonna draw a map of the world.

42:33.092 --> 42:33.968
I...

42:42.226 --> 42:44.687
am gonna become
a brave warrior of the sea!

42:45.187 --> 42:46.313
[laughs]

42:49.108 --> 42:50.109
This is it, crew.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.530
The Grand Line.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.868
Nothing's gonna stand in our way!

42:59.868 --> 43:01.829
Yeah!

43:01.829 --> 43:05.291
Whoo!

43:06.834 --> 43:07.793
[chuckles]

43:08.877 --> 43:10.421
Yeah!
