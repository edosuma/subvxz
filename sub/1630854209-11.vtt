00:02.741 --> 00:04.134
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...
<i>You were supposed</i>

00:04.134 --> 00:05.788
<i>to be giving me $30,000
as a down payment,</i>

00:05.788 --> 00:07.224
and instead you're giving
me a baseball bat?

00:07.224 --> 00:08.399
Roy Campanella's bat.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.966
The joint's yours.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.274
Play the long game, Regina.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.753
To get done
what we both want

00:14.753 --> 00:15.928
to get done.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.234
You need your job,
and I need mine.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.453
<i>I don't want to keep this</i>

00:18.453 --> 00:20.368
a secret any longer
than we need to.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.630
What's up, man?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.590
Bentley!

00:25.590 --> 00:27.984
I put that punk-ass partner
of yours in a box myself.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.768
<i>Is he dead?</i>

00:29.768 --> 00:31.074
Very much alive.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.771
I recorded his confession.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.077
There's gonna be
consequences behind this.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.297
Am I gonna get fired?

00:50.311 --> 00:53.488
♪ I'm tired of arguing
with you ♪

00:53.488 --> 00:55.968

You got it?

01:16.119 --> 01:17.686
What do you think?

01:17.686 --> 01:19.340
I-- it's straight finally.
You sure?

01:19.340 --> 01:20.645
'Cause I'm cockeyed.
I can't tell.

01:20.645 --> 01:23.126
No, I can.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.780
Detective Killian.

01:24.780 --> 01:25.737
Goody!

01:25.737 --> 01:27.696
Grand opening tonight. For real.

01:27.696 --> 01:31.613
This here's a summons and
complaint commencing a lawsuit

01:31.613 --> 01:34.181
against the two of you
for fraud in the inducement.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.183
Goody, what are you--
what are you talking about?

01:36.183 --> 01:39.708
In lieu of cash, you gave me a
baseball bat to buy this place.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.449
Yeah. Roy Campanella's bat.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.667
Said to have been used
by Roy Campanella

01:42.667 --> 01:44.321
in the 1955 World Series.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.322
Exactly.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.323
And-and it's worth

01:46.323 --> 01:47.585
more than $30,000

01:47.585 --> 01:49.021
that we'd agreed on
for a down payment.

01:49.021 --> 01:51.589
I had that bat appraised
for insurance purposes.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.808
Its approximate value--

01:52.808 --> 01:54.810
17 dollars

01:54.810 --> 01:56.333
and 79 cents.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.552
Wait, wait, wait...

01:57.552 --> 01:58.857
It was not used
by Roy Campanella.

01:58.857 --> 02:00.685
It was not used in
the World Series.

02:00.685 --> 02:04.689
It was a souvenir sold in
a gift shop in Cooperstown,

02:04.689 --> 02:06.561
rendering your purchase
of my establishment

02:06.561 --> 02:07.910
null and void.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.520
All right, all
right, let's just

02:09.520 --> 02:10.956
take this a step at a time.
I have taken it

02:10.956 --> 02:13.002
a step at a time. I've
retained an attorney

02:13.002 --> 02:14.873
who's taken the case
on contingency,

02:14.873 --> 02:17.180
so certain he is
that I will prevail.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.226
He advised me that there is
no better time to serve you

02:19.226 --> 02:22.359
with legal process than just
prior to your grand opening,

02:22.359 --> 02:24.361
an event you may
want to put off

02:24.361 --> 02:26.146
until such time
as your reputation

02:26.146 --> 02:29.236
and financial situation
has been rectified.

02:29.236 --> 02:32.761
Unfortunately, I think your
reputation is beyond repair.

02:32.761 --> 02:33.979
Good day.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.546
Wait, Goody...

02:35.546 --> 02:36.982
Just...

02:39.463 --> 02:40.943
Hey.

02:41.813 --> 02:44.164
All right.
Yeah, all right.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.083
What do you think's
gonna happen to Sandeford?

02:51.083 --> 02:53.042
I can't think
about Sandeford right now.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.696
Tommy, it was a
good faith error.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.740
You thought the bat
was the real thing.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.394
You mean when I acquired it,

02:57.394 --> 02:59.048
thinking it was the real thing.
The fact that you

02:59.048 --> 03:00.832
acquired it the way
you did is irrelevant

03:00.832 --> 03:02.486
to the fraud in the
inducement part,

03:02.486 --> 03:03.966
which is what you're
being sued for.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.794
Thank you, Counselor.
I feel so much better now.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.970
All right. What do we got, Aziz?

03:07.970 --> 03:08.840
Jane Doe.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.233
M.E.'s first impression--

03:10.233 --> 03:11.756
head trauma received in a fall.

03:11.756 --> 03:14.063
Watch your step.
You're good.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.940
I don't see a purse anywhere.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.379
She got a missing button.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.597
We do have
a cell phone.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.251
Have Crime Scene bag up

03:28.251 --> 03:30.253
whatever's on the ground nearby.
You guys have

03:30.253 --> 03:32.647
any idea how long it's
gonna take to restore service?

03:32.647 --> 03:33.952
There's a dead woman, guy.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.258
It'll take
as long as it takes.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.259
Look, I got a boss

03:36.259 --> 03:37.521
asking me when, man.

03:37.521 --> 03:39.828
We all got bosses
asking us when.

03:42.047 --> 03:45.616
Bill T. Jones dance performance
at City Center.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.792
Was she scalping tickets?

03:47.792 --> 03:50.839
Why is that the first
thing that occurs to you?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.799
<i>She could've gone
through the turnstile</i>

03:54.799 --> 03:56.148
using a card or a phone.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.281
She could have also jumped
the turnstile.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.153
Does that seem likely?
Does it seem likely
she was scalping tickets?

04:01.153 --> 04:02.590
That's all right.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.679
That's who would've bought
these tickets?

04:04.679 --> 04:07.247
Can you give us the name
on that credit card?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.813
Thank you. Much appreciated.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.424
They were
student tickets,

04:10.424 --> 04:13.470
bought with a credit card in the
name of KR Dance Experience.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.385
What kind of students?

04:20.042 --> 04:22.827
And five, six,
seven, eight.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.743
One, two, three, four,

04:25.743 --> 04:29.356
five, six, seven. Nice.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.010
Two, three. And lift.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.447
Uh-huh.

04:33.447 --> 04:34.578
Seven, eight.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.799
Two, two,
three, four,

04:37.799 --> 04:41.150
five, six, seven, eight.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.543
Mmm.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.022
Nice elbows.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.898
Nice, ladies.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.641
Head melt. Uh-huh!

04:53.641 --> 04:57.297
All right, take five, then
we'll work on the second phrase.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.863
Can I help you?

04:58.863 --> 05:01.692
Uh, we're detectives
from the 7-4 Squad.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.042
Can you tell us
who might have picked up

05:04.042 --> 05:06.044
or purchased tickets
to see Bill T. Jones?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.916
Yeah. That would've been Kia.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.222
And what's Kia's last name?

05:10.222 --> 05:11.615
Kia Russell.

05:11.615 --> 05:14.401
When's the last time
you saw Kia Russell?

05:14.401 --> 05:16.054
Yesterday afternoon.

05:16.054 --> 05:19.971
Is she a student here
or an instructor?

05:19.971 --> 05:21.625
She started
this place.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.366
It's her school.

05:23.366 --> 05:24.889
Has something happened?

05:24.889 --> 05:27.805
Unfortunately,
something <i>has</i> happened.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.111
Kia Russell's body

05:29.111 --> 05:31.287
was found this morning
on the subway tracks.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.897
What do you mean?

05:32.897 --> 05:34.421
We're trying to
piece together

05:34.421 --> 05:35.639
how it happened.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.032
If you
can provide

05:37.032 --> 05:39.295
any family members
we should be in touch with...

05:39.295 --> 05:41.297
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.907
What happened, Tanya?

05:43.952 --> 05:46.171
Something terrible, honey.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.218
Our Kia's gone.

06:13.285 --> 06:16.201
You got some real psychopaths
working here, you know that?

06:16.201 --> 06:18.029
I'm sorry you feel
that way, ma'am.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.292
You're sorry I feel that way.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.078
But are you sorry one of
your officers is a bully?

06:23.078 --> 06:24.906
Well, you're
gonna be sorry

06:24.906 --> 06:26.342
when Sotomayor
hears about it.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.648
And she will hear about it.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.171
I'll see to that.
Have a good day, ma'am.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.436
What are you looking at?

06:35.525 --> 06:37.745
What was that all about?

06:37.745 --> 06:41.096
Uh, she was collared
on the late tour for shoplifting

06:41.096 --> 06:42.445
at a convenience store.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.621
According to the...
arresting officer,

06:44.621 --> 06:47.450
she put up a struggle
when they got out to the car.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.322
Had some kind of head injury
that the desk sergeant decided

06:50.322 --> 06:51.715
required attention.

06:51.715 --> 06:52.934
Called an ambulance.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.588
EMTs said
it didn't require stitches.

06:54.588 --> 06:58.156
So they cleaned her up
and put a bandage on it.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.637
Petit larceny, disorderly
conduct, resisting arrest.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.117
Who's the arresting officer?

07:02.117 --> 07:04.641
Gabe Finley.

07:04.641 --> 07:05.816
I don't get it.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.296
She gets detained
for shoplifting,

07:07.296 --> 07:08.776
doesn't put up a struggle,

07:08.776 --> 07:11.169
gets outside
and goes crazy.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.128
Maybe she freaked out when
he tried to put her in the car.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.347
What do we know about
the arresting officer?

07:15.347 --> 07:16.566
I don't know that much about him

07:16.566 --> 07:19.134
because, uh, he's
on the midnight tour.

07:19.134 --> 07:20.875
Although now
that I think of it,

07:20.875 --> 07:24.444
he has a high number
of CCRB complaints against him.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.706
How high?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.621
Precinct top ten, for sure.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.842
Yeah.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.540
Yeah, get me his personnel file.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.952
She was pushed.
She was definitely pushed.

07:54.952 --> 07:58.042
And the M.E. confirms blunt
force trauma to the skull.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.480
There's that missing button.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.220
And what does that tell you?

08:02.220 --> 08:05.136
With a loose thread,
tells me there was a struggle.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.703
Yeah, what, she couldn't
have left her house

08:06.703 --> 08:08.357
with a button missing?

08:09.097 --> 08:11.055
Look at that scarf.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.579
A woman who ties
a scarf like that

08:12.579 --> 08:14.711
doesn't go out with
a button missing.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.585
Hey.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.761
Someone's trying to use
Kia Russell's credit card.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.987
Yeah.
Officer Sandeford here for you.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.599
Oh, sure. Send him in.

08:35.950 --> 08:36.951
Got a minute to talk, Chief?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.779
Sure.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.433
How are you doing,
Marvin?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.262
Good. I think
maybe I...

08:44.262 --> 08:46.438
left you with the
wrong impression

08:46.438 --> 08:47.657
in the immediate aftermath

08:47.657 --> 08:49.311
of collaring my
partner's shooter.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.008
You definitely left me
with an impression.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.575
I don't know that it was wrong.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.229
It was emotion.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.492
My head was all twisted.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.887
Kept reliving the gunshots
and seeing that kid go down.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.759
You're lucky you didn't
kill anybody, Marvin.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.761
Given your state
of mind,

09:04.761 --> 09:06.763
that could've easily been
the case.
All due respect,

09:06.763 --> 09:08.112
Chief, it wasn't luck.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.679
I took pains in making
sure that didn't happen.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.377
I thought you said your head
was all twisted. Uh...

09:12.377 --> 09:14.379
which is it?
I know it's up to the first dep,

09:14.379 --> 09:16.207
but I also know you carry
a lot of weight with him.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.166
Can you give me

09:18.166 --> 09:19.602
a clue to what's likely
to happen?

09:19.602 --> 09:22.605
As of right now,
you're on modified duty.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.085
How long for,

09:24.085 --> 09:25.565
to be determined.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.653
Hmm.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.872
Whether anything happens
beyond that...

09:30.700 --> 09:32.484
...to be determined.

09:35.662 --> 09:39.753
I-I hope they're gonna let me
keep on being a cop, Chief.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.321
I don't know
how to do nothing else.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.805
So...

09:48.805 --> 09:51.591
you came into possession
of this credit card how?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.549
I found it
on the subway platform, a'ight?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.507
I intended on
returning it

09:55.507 --> 09:57.118
to its rightful owner.
Did you also intend

09:57.118 --> 09:59.468
on returning the pocketbook
you picked up?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.818
I bought a pair of
freakin' sneakers, okay?

10:01.818 --> 10:03.124
You want, I'll return 'em.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.604
Did you speak to the woman
whose bag it is?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.779
I didn't know whose bag it was.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.476
Here's what I think happened--

10:07.476 --> 10:08.782
you tried to snatch the
bag out of her hand...

10:08.782 --> 10:09.609
Whoa.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.958
...she put up a fight,

10:10.958 --> 10:12.829
so you pushed her off
the platform onto the tracks.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.526
Her body was found
on the tracks,

10:14.526 --> 10:15.876
and it's our job to find out

10:15.876 --> 10:17.529
how it got there.
And the fact that you're

10:17.529 --> 10:19.531
in possession of her credit card
kinda makes you a...

10:19.531 --> 10:21.185
prime suspect, wouldn't you say?

10:21.185 --> 10:23.318
I would never try to snatch
a bag out of somebody's hands.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.496
Did I pick it up off the ground
and try to use her credit card?

10:27.496 --> 10:28.845
Yes.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.151
But I didn't touch anybody.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.109
Well, you might be
telling the truth,

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
but we won't know that
until we check

10:33.676 --> 10:36.897
the timecodes on the security
cameras in the subway station.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.550
In the meantime,

10:38.550 --> 10:42.337
you're under arrest for criminal
possession of stolen property.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.517
I'm going over to the
hospital to see Bentley.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.953
Is there anything
you want me to bring?

10:49.953 --> 10:51.259
Did you get him
those cinnamon rolls he likes?

10:51.259 --> 10:52.695
Yep. Got 'em right here.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.001
And don't forget--
you got to get

10:54.001 --> 10:55.219
the rugs up in his apartment.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.133
I did that before
I left for work.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.395
'Cause if he trips on o...

10:57.395 --> 10:58.527
I-I know.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.140
I also got him this.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.533
What is it?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.578
It's called a sock valet. Mm.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.232
Allows him to
lie down in bed

11:08.232 --> 11:09.581
and put his socks on
without bending over.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.714
Is that something
he's gonna want?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.194
I mean, he's always complaining
about his feet being cold,

11:13.194 --> 11:14.456
so I think...

11:15.196 --> 11:17.024
Yes. I-I think

11:17.024 --> 11:18.939
he's gonna want it.
Oh, he's gonna love it.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.244
He is gonna love it.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.506
I'll talk to you soon.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.249
Inspector.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.034
This is
Don Jankowicz.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.209
Union trustee

11:28.209 --> 11:29.514
from Brooklyn North.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.820
Inspector, I've heard
only good things.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.953
You and I both know
that isn't true.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.606
Oh, you got a lot more
people rooting for you
than you might think.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.260
You're here
regarding Officer Finley?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.306
Yes.
They maintain

11:38.306 --> 11:39.742
that the use of force

11:39.742 --> 11:42.005
was proportionate
and necessary.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.615
Because?

11:44.312 --> 11:46.618
Perpetrator failed to
comply with instructions.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.621
Resisted reasonable efforts
to contain and control

11:49.621 --> 11:52.624
and represented a...
immediate physical threat

11:52.624 --> 11:53.756
to myself
and others.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.627
Did you memorize that, Officer?

11:55.627 --> 11:57.760
JANKOWICZ [chuckles]:
He's just trying to be
precise, Inspector.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.370
I tell him he doesn't
have to worry about

11:59.370 --> 12:01.895
the legal mumbo jumbo--
just be real.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.462
Well, sometimes that is
the hardest part, isn't it?

12:04.462 --> 12:07.639
Not for me, Inspector.
The woman refused
to get in the car.

12:07.639 --> 12:10.164
Did she give you a
reason for her refusal?
I don't know,

12:10.164 --> 12:12.166
I guess it had something to do
with not wanting to go to jail

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
or...

12:13.907 --> 12:15.343
Officer Finley?

12:15.343 --> 12:17.258
She did not give a reason.

12:17.258 --> 12:20.870
But you did eventually get her
into the car, did you not?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.045
Yes, I did, Captain.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.743
I effectuated a
posterior restraint.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.919
Was able to maneuver the
suspect into the back seat.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.659
Did "effectuating
a posterior restraint"

12:27.659 --> 12:30.750
cause her to require
medical attention?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.490
Oh. That's
really a question

12:32.490 --> 12:34.014
for someone
with medical expertise.

12:34.014 --> 12:37.495
I think we can still hear
from the officer on the subject.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.323
Can we not?

12:41.021 --> 12:43.284
Notwithstanding
that she had a small frame,

12:43.284 --> 12:44.764
she put up a fight.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.243
As I'm sure you know, Inspector,

12:46.243 --> 12:48.115
police officers are not allowed
to lose fights.

12:48.115 --> 12:50.682
Uh, you seem to charge
a high proportion

12:50.682 --> 12:53.163
of the people you
collar with, uh,

12:53.163 --> 12:54.556
resisting arrest. Uh...

12:54.556 --> 12:57.733
I think that may tell us
something about <i>you.</i>

12:57.733 --> 13:00.344
Gabe, would you give us
a minute here?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.042
Yeah.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.915
What's going on here,
Inspector?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.004
All due respect.
I'm looking into this
officer's compliance

13:08.004 --> 13:10.702
with the departmental
use of force policy.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.009
All well and good, and maybe
given the ever-changing

13:13.009 --> 13:14.445
definition of "excessive,"
he's gonna have

13:14.445 --> 13:15.707
to take a rip for that.

13:15.707 --> 13:16.970
But why are we bringing up

13:16.970 --> 13:18.232
this grab bag
of unrelated statistics?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.711
Because they're not unrelated.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.409
This is a good guy, Inspector.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.498
Has a wife, a three-year-old.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.891
Been working midnights

13:24.891 --> 13:26.675
for over two years
without complaining.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.808
Can we not put this to rest
without jeopardizing

13:28.808 --> 13:30.548
his career by getting
Internal Affairs involved?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.376
Investigation
will determine that.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.856
An investigation?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.553
Or a power play
against the union?

13:35.553 --> 13:36.816
All right, that's uncalled for.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.426
All I can say is that the union

13:38.426 --> 13:40.080
will be paying attention.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.386
And they will have
something to say about it.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.655
Inspector?

13:50.655 --> 13:51.874
Yes?
The mother of the DOA

13:51.874 --> 13:53.789
from the subway's here
to see somebody.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.183
She can see me. You can
bring her in now, Sergeant.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.446
Thank you.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.104
My daughter's been dancing
since she was five.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.410
She didn't slip.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.412
She didn't trip.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.632
She knew exactly
where her body was

14:10.632 --> 14:12.590
and exactly what it was doing.

14:12.590 --> 14:16.203
Ms. Russell, we don't think
she slipped either.

14:16.203 --> 14:19.075
Somebody pushed her?

14:19.075 --> 14:21.208
We believe so.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.253
Who would do that?

14:24.037 --> 14:26.387
That's what we're
trying to find out.

14:28.955 --> 14:32.088
These are Detectives
Killian and Morales.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.438
They're going to be
the lead investigators

14:34.438 --> 14:35.700
in your daughter's case.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.660
Detectives,
this is Bettina Russell.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.793
And we're very sorry about
your daughter, Ms. Russell.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.927
Do you mind if they ask
you some questions?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.189
No.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.495
Do you know
if your daughter was out

14:47.495 --> 14:48.539
with anyone last night?

14:48.539 --> 14:50.106
I don't know.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.674
To the best of your knowledge
was she seeing anyone?

14:52.674 --> 14:54.937
The only people she saw were

14:54.937 --> 14:56.808
the people who came
to her dance studio.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.594
And this was a dance studio
that was owned by her?

14:59.594 --> 15:01.465
She didn't own
the building.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.511
She found a vacant space and...

15:03.511 --> 15:06.122
managed to come up
with the rent.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.385
Kia had a purpose.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.170
Ever since she was
a little girl,

15:10.170 --> 15:11.693
she always had a purpose.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.956
The most important thing
to her was to provide

15:13.956 --> 15:16.785
a space for kids
from East New York to dance.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.657
That was her-- her whole life.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.659
We're going to find whoever

15:21.659 --> 15:23.270
it was that did this.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.968
I'm... numb

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
right now.

15:27.970 --> 15:31.060
But I guess I won't
always be numb, and...

15:31.060 --> 15:34.411
whoever took my daughter
out of this world,

15:34.411 --> 15:36.979
I-I want to know why

15:36.979 --> 15:39.939
and I want to see them punished.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.157
Me, too.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.811
I got to let

15:42.811 --> 15:44.160
some people know. Yes.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.475
Uh, transit just sent this.
What is it?

15:54.475 --> 15:58.000
Two more subway attacks
at the Van Siclen J platform.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.046
Okay, go.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.756
Where's my sexy patient?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.714
Hi.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.760
Brandy.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.892
Hey.
Brandy?

16:20.892 --> 16:22.546
This is my dad.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.852
How do you do? Hi.

16:23.852 --> 16:24.766
Hi.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.028
It's really happening.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.203
I get to go home.

16:27.203 --> 16:28.596
I was afraid there was gonna be

16:28.596 --> 16:29.727
a last-minute complication
or something.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.381
No, no complication.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.644
Now he's got a good six weeks of
physical therapy ahead of him.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.038
But he can do that at home.
Absolutely, and I can

16:36.038 --> 16:38.171
always drive him, there will
always be someone to drive him.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.694
I can drive him, dear.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.304
Of course.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.914
You work at the same precinct
as Andre?
I do, yeah.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.047
I was telling you about her,
Dad. She's who moved into

16:45.047 --> 16:47.136
the housing project first.
Ah, yes.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.529
The housing project.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.791
Proof positive
that you're both nuts.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.055
We better get going if
we're gonna beat the traffic.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.230
Yeah.
Oh!

16:54.230 --> 16:55.927
Highway's sending an escort.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.407
And one of our neighbors prepared

16:57.407 --> 16:59.670
a welcome home
basket for you.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.107
I'm not gonna be going back

17:01.107 --> 17:03.109
to Ruskin Gardens
right now, Brandy.

17:04.414 --> 17:05.589
You're not?

17:05.589 --> 17:08.244
We got a bedroom all set up.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.420
Bathroom that's easy
to move in and out of.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.814
And we're there.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.859
You'll come to visit.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.253
Sure.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.565
- Hey, Marvin.
- Hey.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.219
How you doing?
Oh, good,
you looking for Tommy?

17:26.219 --> 17:28.308
Yeah, if he's around.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.875
Thanks.
I got you.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.094
<i>You could go to jail.</i>

17:32.094 --> 17:33.530
I'm not gonna go
to jail.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.531
But you could.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.185
It's a civil matter, Corinne.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.752
All right?
Worst comes to worst,

17:37.752 --> 17:39.101
we get banged for money we don't
have and that's that.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.624
When you tell me
something like that,

17:40.624 --> 17:42.322
you know what you're
really telling me?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.975
That you think
I am stupid enough

17:43.975 --> 17:45.455
to believe it.
I am not that stupid.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.067
I don't think
you're stupid, Corinne.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.983
Tell Goody we want
to talk to him.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.985
Just us, no lawyers.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.726
Tell him we have
a proposition to make.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.251
All right,
what's the proposition?

17:58.251 --> 18:00.644
I don't know yet.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.733
You don't know?

18:23.841 --> 18:25.191
Teenagers.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.975
That's who plays
the knockout game.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.324
What is that exactly?

18:28.324 --> 18:29.760
All right, you walk up
to a stranger

18:29.760 --> 18:31.022
and you hit 'em
in the face.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.067
I guess you won't be taking

18:32.067 --> 18:33.155
Gang Initiation Rituals

18:33.155 --> 18:34.374
for your category next time

18:34.374 --> 18:36.463
you're on <i>Jeopardy!</i>

18:36.463 --> 18:38.334
All right,
set up a decoy.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.641
Maybe we'll catch 'em
in the act.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.731
<i>I just wanted
to give you a heads-up.</i>

18:43.731 --> 18:46.995
I have a situation
that I may need

18:46.995 --> 18:50.129
Internal Affairs to investigate.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.305
What kind of situation?

18:52.305 --> 18:54.829
One of my cops arrested
a female for shoplifting.

18:54.829 --> 18:58.572
And it seems like he may
have used an excessive

18:58.572 --> 19:00.095
amount of force.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.402
Going to IAB can have

19:02.402 --> 19:05.187
major implications for his
career, but you know that.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.059
Well, if he's beating up
on collars for no reason,

19:08.059 --> 19:10.584
he doesn't deserve
to have a career.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.542
You're right.
You know how many

19:12.542 --> 19:15.023
excessive force complaints
my predecessor sent up to IAB?

19:15.023 --> 19:16.546
Two.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.157
In six years.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.855
So that says to me
that things were being

19:20.855 --> 19:22.857
swept under the rug, which sends

19:22.857 --> 19:26.034
the message that that kind
of behavior is acceptable.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.905
Do what you got to do.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.690
I have some more digging to do

19:29.690 --> 19:32.388
before I decide how to proceed.
I was just...

19:32.388 --> 19:34.042
keeping you
in the loop.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.652
And I appreciate it.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.483
Okay.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.748
Quinlan?

19:44.748 --> 19:46.750
Where's your head?
Nothing, I'm fine.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.056
You're not thinking
about your boyfriend

19:48.056 --> 19:49.579
in the middle
of an operation?

19:49.579 --> 19:51.668
I think it's weird that he moved
back in with his parents.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.105
A big house in Westchester over
Ruskin Gardens is not weird.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.586
Yeah, but don't you think
that says something about us?

19:56.586 --> 19:58.893
That maybe I'm just
his "projects girlfriend"?

19:58.893 --> 20:00.721
Honey, you can't ask me that.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.244
You got to ask him.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.115
Right now you got to put
all of that out of your mind.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.247
Can you do that?

20:05.247 --> 20:06.944
Yes, I can.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.119
What's your distress phrase?

20:08.119 --> 20:09.208
About time.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.426
You got a ghost on the bench.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.427
Transit's ready
to stop the train.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.124
And TARU for the cameras.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.735
All good?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.781
All good.

20:32.187 --> 20:34.276
OFFICER [over radio]:
All units be on the lookout

20:34.276 --> 20:36.583
for two teen males
in white masks.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.280
Goody, it's Tom Killian again.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.412
Can you give me a call back, please?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.457
Still not picking up?

20:41.457 --> 20:42.676
No.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.504
You should just walk away
from it, Tommy.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.680
I can't walk away from it.
He's suing us.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.812
Right. He's suing you.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.249
And what if he wins?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.641
You rent
your apartment.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.904
Your car's ten years old.
What's he gonna get?

20:53.904 --> 20:55.471
Your ties?

20:55.471 --> 20:56.994
Look, I don't want Corinne
to go through that, okay?

20:56.994 --> 20:58.822
I don't want her to
have to go back to...

20:58.822 --> 21:00.781
managing somebody
else's restaurant.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.000
How many jobs are
you working right now?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.698
What's the difference?
How many?

21:04.698 --> 21:07.440
I bounce at the other joint
three nights a week,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.224
do bodyguard work
for the guy in Connecticut,

21:09.224 --> 21:10.834
and this.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.358
And you don't want Corinne
to have to go back

21:12.358 --> 21:14.882
to managing
somebody else's restaurant?

21:14.882 --> 21:16.753
She's my girl.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.712
What can I say?

21:18.712 --> 21:20.931
You ever been
to the White Mountains?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.455
No, I can't say that I have.

21:22.455 --> 21:23.760
Went up there with Francine
a couple of years ago,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.327
stopped in Portsmouth
on the way up.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.198
Began chatting
with this Portsmouth cop.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.461
Where's this going, Stan?

21:28.461 --> 21:29.853
I knew
from his personnel file

21:29.853 --> 21:31.942
that Gabe Finley had been
a cop in Portsmouth.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.683
And because I have this habit

21:33.683 --> 21:35.685
of collecting business cards,
I had

21:35.685 --> 21:38.471
the business card
of this Portsmouth cop

21:38.471 --> 21:40.690
that I struck up
- a conversation with.
- Uh-huh.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.388
I called this cop, whose name--

21:42.388 --> 21:44.128
Beryl Garabedian--

21:44.128 --> 21:45.739
I don't know
why I remember the name.

21:45.739 --> 21:48.872
He's very forthcoming with
information about Gabe Finley.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.353
Telling me he has a string
of complaints filed

21:51.353 --> 21:54.225
against him for use
of excessive force.

21:54.225 --> 21:58.099
Some of which have resulted
in some significant injuries.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.883
How is it that the job didn't

21:59.883 --> 22:02.277
know about that
before he was hired here?

22:02.277 --> 22:05.019
Because his father is
a lieutenant in

22:05.019 --> 22:07.717
the fire department up there
and he was allowed to resign.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.241
Keeping it out
of his personnel file.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.899
Notify Internal Affairs.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.945
He's done.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.432
Oh, here you go.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.262
Half day today?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.569
And he's a comedian.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.005
How's it going, Don?
I'm good.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.659
I just wanted to catch you
before you left.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.052
You going out to your car?
I'll walk with you.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.401
Can it wait?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.576
I don't want to be
a pain in the ass,

22:40.576 --> 22:42.143
but I don't think
it really can.

22:42.143 --> 22:45.320
Listen, what's the story
with this, uh, Regina Haywood?

22:46.452 --> 22:47.975
What do you mean,
what's the story?

22:47.975 --> 22:49.977
Well, I'm sure she's performed
admirably in the past,

22:49.977 --> 22:52.327
elsewise she wouldn't
be precinct commander,

22:52.327 --> 22:54.677
but she's really going
after this kid

22:54.677 --> 22:56.679
Gabe Finley like she's
got it in for him.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.507
I know it's your job to make
a case for your member,

22:58.507 --> 23:00.379
but it's possible
this guy's a problem.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.468
He's an active cop.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.469
You know what
that's like.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.166
Active? I do.

23:05.166 --> 23:08.343
So many guys on the job today--
all they want to do is hide.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.127
But Finley's not like that.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.042
You take a look at how
many collars he's got?

23:12.042 --> 23:13.957
Nobody's saying he's not
doing his job, Donnie.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.090
But we can't have loose cannons
out there, not anymore.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.049
Haywood keeps talking about
community support, am I wrong?

23:19.049 --> 23:21.443
Mm-hmm.
But if she keeps going
the way she's going,

23:21.443 --> 23:24.141
she's gonna lose the
community that matters most.

23:24.141 --> 23:25.665
Us.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.453
She's the C.O. of the 7-4.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.325
I'm not gonna interfere with
her going to Internal Affairs

23:34.325 --> 23:35.892
if that's what she wants to do.

23:35.892 --> 23:38.068
But if she goes, maybe
you can, uh, I don't know,

23:38.068 --> 23:41.202
weigh in on what you think is
a reasonable resolution to this.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.073
Let's see what happens.

23:43.073 --> 23:46.512
Let's see what their
investigation concludes.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.035
Hey, all I'm asking.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.558
Can I go home now?

23:49.558 --> 23:52.474
The unions are down
the line for you, Chief.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.824
And I appreciate it.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.696
And when they start talking
about possible candidates

23:56.696 --> 23:58.959
for three stars and beyond,

23:58.959 --> 24:01.614
you're on the short list,
my friend.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.051
You wouldn't be
presenting this

24:04.051 --> 24:05.748
as if it was a quid pro quo,

24:05.748 --> 24:07.968
now would you, Donnie?
Not at all.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.624
You show yourself out.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.600
Tommy.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.429
Look alive.
Two teen males, white masks,

24:34.429 --> 24:36.083
just entered the platform.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.101
Stay down! Don't move!

25:01.500 --> 25:02.718
What'd I do?!

25:02.718 --> 25:04.154
I was just talking to her!

25:04.154 --> 25:05.504
Now you get to talk to me.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.896
Give me your hands.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.116
You good?
Yeah, we're good.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.127
Where were you two nights
ago, Rocket?
King's Plaza.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.998
Yeah, what were
you doing there?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.826
Trying to get a job
at Foot Locker.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.046
Where were you two nights ago,
Troylen?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.743
My Aunt Shanika's.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.092
Who else was there?

25:29.092 --> 25:30.529
My cousins, everybody.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.531
How can we get in contact
with your cousins?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.533
One of them's
in the police academy.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.143
Just ask for him.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.101
What time did
you leave King's Plaza?

25:38.101 --> 25:39.973
When they closed.
Where'd you go then?

25:39.973 --> 25:41.104
My mom's.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.584
Total stranger?

25:42.584 --> 25:44.499
You just punch them in the face?

25:44.499 --> 25:46.588
What do you get out of that?
I don't get nothing.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.198
<i>I ain't never done it.</i>

25:48.198 --> 25:50.723
How many times you play
this knockout game, Rocket?

25:50.723 --> 25:53.247
<i>If you're asking
why other people do it,</i>

25:53.247 --> 25:55.336
I'd say they do it
because it's fun.

25:55.336 --> 25:59.209
We have these guys for assault
three, but sorry to say,

25:59.209 --> 26:00.863
their alibi
for pushing Kia Russell

26:00.863 --> 26:02.212
off the platform holds up.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.562
Twisted
little bastards.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.172
Stay open to the possibility
that it's

26:05.172 --> 26:07.391
another crew
who are equally as twisted.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.610
Got it.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.394
Just got word
from Internal Affairs.

26:10.394 --> 26:14.964
They're bouncing back the Finley
case to Borough Investigations.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.619
Our friend Jankowicz from the
union must have gotten to them.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.968
Well, somebody did.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.189
Hey. Um, since Officer Bentley

26:22.189 --> 26:23.625
is out of the hospital,
I was wondering

26:23.625 --> 26:26.323
if I might be assigned
to drive him to physical therapy

26:26.323 --> 26:28.717
and whatever treatment
he may need.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.371
Got to assign someone.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.855
I'm happy to have it be you,
Officer Quinlan.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.819
What happened?

26:43.819 --> 26:44.951
You get detention?

26:44.951 --> 26:46.561
Yeah. Something
like that there.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.215
Where's your badge?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.565
It's called a shield.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.523
No gun?

26:52.523 --> 26:54.351
No. No gun.

26:54.351 --> 26:57.746
What the hell? You might as well
be a school crossing guard.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.530
Hey, Goody.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.662
Thanks for coming.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.837
Yeah.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.318
Drop by anytime.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.363
Damn.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.190
Hey.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.844
You tell him yet?

27:08.844 --> 27:10.237
No. Um...

27:10.237 --> 27:11.673
We have
a proposition

27:11.673 --> 27:12.674
to make.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.980
I'm listening.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.636
Take 50% of the bar back and...

27:17.636 --> 27:19.463
come run it
with Corinne. Together.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.988
I used to own 100%,
and I ran it by myself.

27:22.815 --> 27:25.121
Look, we both know
you weren't making any money.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.383
You were worn out.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.907
You wanted
to walk away.

27:27.907 --> 27:31.040
I think you might've changed
your mind about walking away.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.564
I think
it can make money.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.697
And I think you liked
having that old saloon

27:35.697 --> 27:37.568
to come to every day.

27:37.568 --> 27:40.528
Oh. So then this would
be you helping <i>me</i> out.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.705
No. We're trying
to help ourselves, Goody.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.141
Okay? But...

27:45.141 --> 27:48.362
but if we team up, maybe
it'll be good for all of us.

27:59.068 --> 28:02.245

Hey!

28:29.359 --> 28:30.621
Hi.

28:30.621 --> 28:33.537
Everybody, this is--
this is Brandy Quinlan.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.322
She's been assigned
to check up on me.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.498
Yeah. Um, how are you feeling?

28:37.498 --> 28:38.542
Good.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.414
I'm feeling good. Good.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.024
His mother confers
with his doctor

28:42.024 --> 28:43.765
at least five
or six times a day.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.726
You can assure your boss
Andre's on the mend.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.510
I'll tell them.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.340
Well, there's a--
there's a whole

28:53.340 --> 28:54.471
spread laid out
in the dining room.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.734
Get yourself
something to eat.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.300
Um...
Carmelina will fix her

28:57.300 --> 28:58.780
a plate. Actually,
that's-that's okay.

28:58.780 --> 28:59.955
I'm actually not hungry.

28:59.955 --> 29:00.869
Well, I'll put
on some shoes.

29:00.869 --> 29:01.957
We can take a walk.

29:01.957 --> 29:02.784
Please, Andre, don't push it.

29:02.784 --> 29:03.742
Mom, I'm fine.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.395
I'm fine.
We'll just...

29:05.395 --> 29:06.788
We'll do it another time.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.312
Okay. RJ, hey, can you--
can you go get her a...

29:09.312 --> 29:10.792
get her a chair,
please?
I've actually got

29:10.792 --> 29:12.794
to run.
You just got here.
Go... get the chair.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.754
Well, I mean, they just wanted
me to check in on you,

29:15.754 --> 29:16.929
see if you need anything,

29:16.929 --> 29:18.800
and then
get back. So...

29:18.800 --> 29:20.236
do you need anything?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.631
No. I'm all set.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.502
Okay.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.504
Well, um, I'll check in

29:27.504 --> 29:28.636
tomorrow and...

29:28.636 --> 29:32.074
It was very nice
to meet all of you.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.716
Still don't have a suspect
on that subway pushing?

30:05.716 --> 30:07.370
No. We, uh,
thought we did.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.068
As of now, nada.

30:09.068 --> 30:11.113
Well, Sergeant Kee brought
something to my attention

30:11.113 --> 30:12.375
which may prove relevant.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.724
Well, I happened
to see some of what

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
was collected
on the tracks.

30:15.204 --> 30:18.468
One of the things I noticed
was this book.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.299
<i>To The Finland Station?</i>

30:23.299 --> 30:24.735
And what is it,
a travel book?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.085
Classic book

30:26.085 --> 30:27.521
on the history
of the Russian Revolution.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.306
It's not a first edition
but it's an early edition.

30:30.306 --> 30:33.527
And it happens to have
been signed by the author.

30:33.527 --> 30:34.789
What are you, a communist?

30:35.616 --> 30:37.444
I happen to know something
about rare books.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.576
So what's significant
about this?
Well, the value

30:39.576 --> 30:42.841
of a signed edition of this book
in excellent to fine condition

30:42.841 --> 30:44.364
is about $500.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.670
Wow.
So how'd it wind up in a puddle

30:46.670 --> 30:48.803
on the tracks?
Well, I don't know
the answer to that,

30:48.803 --> 30:51.066
but you might start by looking
at the East New York branch

30:51.066 --> 30:52.372
of the public library.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.895
That's where
it was taken out from.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.202
Thanks.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.464
Library.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.729
Hey, I want Finley inside.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.123
Well, I don't know what
administrative jobs are open

31:04.123 --> 31:05.124
on the midnight tour.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.212
No, forget the midnight tour.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.996
I want him on the day tour.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.998
That way, we can keep
an eye on him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.000
You sure you
want to do this?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.828
Do I have the authority
to do it?

31:13.828 --> 31:16.004
Of course.
Then do it.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.051
Okay.

31:23.925 --> 31:26.232
Well, might be something,
might be nothing.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.060
Either way,
it's all we got.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.804
We're detectives
from the 7-4 Squad.

31:33.804 --> 31:34.849
Here about a book.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.285
Well, you're in the right place.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.896
We need to know who took out
a particular book.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.898
Uh...

31:39.898 --> 31:41.900
<i>To The Finland Station</i>
by Edmund Wilson.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.120
No one took it out.
It should be on the shelf.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.121
I'm wondering

31:46.121 --> 31:47.427
if we can verify that.

31:48.297 --> 31:51.561
Albert? Can you take these
detectives to the stacks

31:51.561 --> 31:53.563
and see
if <i>To The Finland Station</i> is

31:53.563 --> 31:54.564
on the shelf?

31:54.564 --> 31:55.739
I'm leaving early today.

31:55.739 --> 31:57.045
Can someone else do it?

31:57.045 --> 31:59.134
First of all, you
never cleared it with me

31:59.134 --> 32:00.788
to leave
early today.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.269
Second of all, you can still
do what I'm asking you to do.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.494
Uh, why don't you go
with Albert?

32:11.494 --> 32:12.843
I'll meet you there.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.846
Albert's been a little
high-strung lately,

32:15.846 --> 32:17.065
even for him.

32:17.892 --> 32:20.982
There someplace people
who work here might stash books

32:20.982 --> 32:22.984
they're looking to steal?

32:25.291 --> 32:28.990
Well, Albert, I guess you will
be going home early today.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.774
<i>Whatever books I took,</i>

32:30.774 --> 32:32.080
<i>the library was getting rid of.</i>

32:32.080 --> 32:33.473
Why would they be
getting rid of

32:33.473 --> 32:34.909
a signed edition worth
hundreds of dollars?

32:34.909 --> 32:37.172
Because they don't know anything.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.131
And because they don't take
the time to learn anything.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.132
This is easy

32:40.132 --> 32:41.307
to sort out.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.873
I mean, we'll get
a search warrant,

32:42.873 --> 32:44.745
go through your apartment,
see what you got in there.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.051
What, this?

32:46.051 --> 32:48.792
This is a
high-priority item

32:48.792 --> 32:51.273
right now
in East New York? Really?

32:51.273 --> 32:53.667
I would think that you'd have
more pressing matters

32:53.667 --> 32:54.973
to attend to.

32:56.409 --> 32:59.673
Did you take the J train
from the Van Siclen platform

32:59.673 --> 33:01.805
two nights
ago, Albert?

33:01.805 --> 33:03.111
I don't know.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.504
We're gonna
run your card

33:04.504 --> 33:06.375
and find that out.
Might as well tell us.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.116
Anything happen while you were
waiting for the train, Albert?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.512
What, i-is this some sort
of trick question?

33:12.512 --> 33:14.035
It's a simple question.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.080
Did you speak
to a young woman

33:15.080 --> 33:16.385
while you
were there?

33:16.385 --> 33:19.432
I don't recall
speaking to anyone.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.609
This young woman.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.052
It's possible I had
some random encounter

33:31.052 --> 33:33.750
with her or someone
that looked like her.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.143
What kind of
random encounter?

33:35.143 --> 33:37.928
Look, I keep to myself.
All right?

33:37.928 --> 33:39.321
I don't bother anyone,

33:39.321 --> 33:41.454
and I don't want anyone
to bother me.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.501
What kind of random
encounter, Albert?

33:51.072 --> 33:52.856
She asked to use my phone.

33:53.683 --> 33:56.077
She said hers had died
and she had to call someone

33:56.077 --> 33:58.384
to tell them
that she couldn't meet them--

33:58.384 --> 34:01.822
all details I wasn't
the least bit interested in.

34:02.649 --> 34:06.261
But because I thought it would
be easier to just hand it to her

34:06.261 --> 34:08.524
rather than to continue
the conversation,

34:08.524 --> 34:12.267
I reached in my bag
to pull it out and...

34:12.267 --> 34:15.401
somehow the contents
spilled out.

34:15.401 --> 34:19.100
She got in the way
of my dealing with that,

34:19.100 --> 34:20.928
so...

34:20.928 --> 34:23.148
I pushed her <i>out</i> of the way.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.673
I suppose
she thought

34:26.673 --> 34:28.501
she was helping.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.721
How hard did you
push, Albert?

34:31.721 --> 34:33.636
I don't know.

34:33.636 --> 34:36.291
Hard enough for her to
wind up on the tracks?

34:38.206 --> 34:40.121
Oh, dear God.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.312
Sorry to interrupt.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.662
I wanted to tell
you in person.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.534
We made an arrest.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.449
Was it someone
my daughter knew?

35:03.449 --> 35:06.365
No. Apparently, it was
someone she had never met.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.367
According to
what this...

35:08.367 --> 35:10.412
individual told us,

35:10.412 --> 35:13.328
they had some kind
of interaction

35:13.328 --> 35:15.200
on the subway platform,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.854
he became agitated and...

35:17.854 --> 35:20.292
he pushed her onto the tracks.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.337
A total stranger?

35:22.337 --> 35:24.513
So it would seem.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.734
Who had no idea
who my daughter was.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.693
Didn't know she trudged
around for six months

35:30.693 --> 35:32.739
before she found a space
for her dance studio

35:32.739 --> 35:34.915
that she could afford.

35:34.915 --> 35:37.831
Didn't know she loaned
what little money she had

35:37.831 --> 35:41.704
to her students who couldn't
afford to pay for anything.

35:43.184 --> 35:46.970
When a young woman like your
daughter is taken from us,

35:46.970 --> 35:49.277
we look for
a reason.

35:49.277 --> 35:53.455
Sometimes there is
no reason, it's...

35:55.196 --> 35:58.199
There are some who
say it's the city,

35:58.199 --> 35:59.940
but I don't think so.

36:00.723 --> 36:03.422
The city's also
my daughter.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.164
And looks like
you're picking up

36:06.164 --> 36:07.904
where your
daughter's left off.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.213
Her girls came
for class.

36:13.475 --> 36:17.392
Thought it would be a good idea
for all of us to have one.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.700
I won't keep you.

there'll be a few more
people showing up.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.382
Hey.

36:50.382 --> 36:51.948
And it's a weeknight.

36:51.948 --> 36:54.081
I know. It's just
we've been promoting it

36:54.081 --> 36:55.778
as the grand opening.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.780
I thought there'd be at least a
few people from the neighborhood

36:57.780 --> 36:59.478
showing up to
check it out.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.654
It's known
as a cop bar, Corinne.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.873
People from the neighborhood
aren't necessarily interested

37:03.873 --> 37:05.658
in checking it out.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.574

37:25.721 --> 37:26.983
Correct.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.376
I've already spoken to him.

37:28.376 --> 37:30.291
He knows it's against
department regulations

37:30.291 --> 37:33.990
to have any interest in
an establishment selling liquor.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.297
He's doing it by the book, boss.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.820
Uh, restaurants are tough.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.822
I don't know that they'll
make a go of it here.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.084
It's fine. It's early.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.085
No, but...

37:42.085 --> 37:43.348
No, it's early.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.915
What?

37:56.535 --> 37:58.450
50% of liquor,
food and the door.

37:58.450 --> 37:59.581
What door?

37:59.581 --> 38:01.104
When we have entertainment,

38:01.104 --> 38:02.149

39:17.746 --> 39:19.879
You're not messing with me,
are you, Chief?

39:19.879 --> 39:21.794
I convinced
the first dep

39:21.794 --> 39:24.144
to chalk up what you did
to special circumstances.

39:24.144 --> 39:25.537
He took my word,

39:25.537 --> 39:26.929
based on how long
we've known each other,

39:26.929 --> 39:30.585
that nothing like it
will ever happen again.

39:32.587 --> 39:35.547

39:35.547 --> 39:37.331

brighten up the sky... ♪

39:39.333 --> 39:41.596
Well, what do you know?

39:42.554 --> 39:44.207
I don't
usually see you

39:44.207 --> 39:45.905
in these venues, Chief.
Yeah, well,

39:45.905 --> 39:47.907
I like to get out
every once in a while.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.039
Seems like, uh, whatever
you said to Internal Affairs

39:50.039 --> 39:51.650
about Finley here...

39:52.564 --> 39:55.044
...had
the desired effect.

39:55.044 --> 39:56.437
I didn't desire any

39:56.437 --> 39:57.960
particular effect.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.441
What I said to them
is that I expected

40:00.441 --> 40:03.096
a fair and impartial evaluation.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.619
Which is exactly what we got.

40:04.619 --> 40:07.448
The problem is
Deputy Inspector Haywood,

40:07.448 --> 40:09.537
who's neither fair
nor impartial.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.452
She took Finley
off the late tour

40:11.452 --> 40:13.019
and put him
on a desk

40:13.019 --> 40:14.629
without so much
as a whiff of due process.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.501
Donnie, it's well
within her authority

40:16.501 --> 40:17.980
to manage personnel.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.026
And it's well within
your authority to manage <i>her.</i>

40:21.114 --> 40:23.899
I'm with you
till the last dog dies.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.379
But that's me.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.469
The police unions are watching
how you're handling this.

40:28.469 --> 40:30.950
Don't take their support
for granted.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.663
Hold on.

40:51.187 --> 40:53.407
Oh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.195
Hey, Chief.

40:59.195 --> 41:00.240
- Regina.
- Chief.

41:02.068 --> 41:03.722
<i>Gracias.</i>

41:04.984 --> 41:08.204
Finley's got to stay
on the late tour.
Sorry, what?

41:08.204 --> 41:11.773
You can have the late tour
platoon commander monitor him,

41:11.773 --> 41:14.428
but, uh, you
can't move him.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.518
This come out of
your conversation with Jankowicz

41:17.518 --> 41:18.693
just now?

41:18.693 --> 41:19.955
It comes out of
my determination

41:19.955 --> 41:21.261
of what's right.

41:21.261 --> 41:24.133
And that union trustee
has nothing to do with it.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.485
I'll let you draw
your own conclusions.

41:32.881 --> 41:35.754
Hello. Uh, this on?

41:37.843 --> 41:40.149
This on?

41:44.545 --> 41:47.374
All right then.

41:47.374 --> 41:48.897
I want everybody
to raise a glass

41:48.897 --> 41:51.770
to the official reopening
of this establishment

41:51.770 --> 41:54.816
and the official
partnership between myself

41:54.816 --> 41:56.905
and Ms. Corinne Moynahan.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.516
Come on up here,
young lady.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.041
So, uh, according to

42:02.041 --> 42:03.695
State Liquor Authority records,

42:03.695 --> 42:06.828
there's been a bar
in this location since 1951.

42:06.828 --> 42:09.091
Now,
I wasn't here then

42:09.091 --> 42:10.571
and Goody wasn't here then...
Sure about that?

42:10.571 --> 42:13.487
I'm kidding!

42:13.487 --> 42:14.662
But we are here now,

42:14.662 --> 42:16.011
so, cheers, everyone.

42:16.011 --> 42:18.144
Thank you all
for coming.

42:19.058 --> 42:21.321
Ah, look who
else is here!
