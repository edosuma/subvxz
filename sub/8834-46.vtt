Hey, Kit. How about handing me my shades?

01:19.208 --> 01:21.125
Aren't you scared of the police?

01:21.208 --> 01:26.542
The cops have better things to do
than bother upstanding citizens like me.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.375
Upstanding?

01:28.458 --> 01:32.250
You call taking parking laws
sitting down upstanding?

01:32.333 --> 01:34.750
Small potatoes, Little Britches.

01:34.834 --> 01:37.625
I don't break any big laws.

01:37.709 --> 01:39.875
The cops want real criminals.

Gangsters involved in bank robberies,

01:42.458 --> 01:44.792
high-speed chases and bombings.

Well, I've gotta admit,
you've never done that stuff.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.667
[chuckles] I probably never will.

01:51.750 --> 01:56.041

rubbing elbows with gangster types.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.417
Babyface Half Nelson?

01:58.500 --> 02:02.041
You just have to fly him from
Prison island to Cape Suzette for trial.

02:02.125 --> 02:04.250
He's a big gangster.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.166
He cracks safes with his head.

02:07.250 --> 02:11.458
Don't be a baby.
He'll be handcuffed to an armed guard.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.917
Well, OK.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.083
How do I know which one's him?

02:16.166 --> 02:19.083
He'll be wearing stripes, silly.

02:19.583 --> 02:25.125
[Mrs. Half Nelson] Now, do whatever
it takes to spring my Babyface

02:25.208 --> 02:27.667
and get him safely to our hideout.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.375
I sure do miss him.

02:30.625 --> 02:35.667
We ain't never seen your son.
What's he look like?

02:35.750 --> 02:41.208
He'll have a twinkle in his eye
and a sweetest smile you ever did see.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.000
And he'll be wearing stripes,
you chuckleheads!

02:45.500 --> 02:48.500
Now don't forget,
this is a big surprise for his birthday.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.166
He doesn't know you're coming,

02:50.250 --> 02:51.542
so don't blow it!

03:02.083 --> 03:04.917
Comb your hair, Half Nelson.
You're going to trial.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.583
Only Ma tells me to comb my hair.

[Baloo] Hiya, officer.

03:59.041 --> 04:01.709
Say, what happened to Half Nelson?

04:01.792 --> 04:05.375
Uh... He tried to escape,
so I subdued him.

04:05.458 --> 04:08.375
Escape? [laughing] In front of a prison?

04:08.458 --> 04:11.125
Gangsters must be pretty stupid, huh?

04:21.083 --> 04:22.709
Yes, sir, officer,

04:22.792 --> 04:26.834
I was just telling my little buddy Kit
the importance of obeying the law.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.542
Obeying the law, huh?

04:32.625 --> 04:35.208
[nervous chuckle] Well, most of them.

04:36.834 --> 04:40.792
I mean, you're not interested
in small fry like me, right, officer?

04:42.166 --> 04:44.041
Where is that handcuff key?

04:44.625 --> 04:49.375
Parking violations are just
small potatoes, right, officer?

04:49.458 --> 04:51.041
You're not saying much.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.834
Does that mean
they're big potatoes, officer?

04:54.917 --> 04:56.959
Shut your trap.

04:57.041 --> 04:59.875
I got official police business
to worry about.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.542
Why, you!

05:03.333 --> 05:06.458
Hey, big mouth, give me a hand!

05:06.542 --> 05:08.917
Anything you say, officer.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.750
I scratch your back
and you scratch mine, right?

Now, that's some sock.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.667
A bald head wasn't all he was hiding.

05:30.750 --> 05:35.000
He's both a safe-cracker and a pickpocket.

[Babyface] Upholding law and order
kind of makes me thirsty.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.375
I'll go get a soda.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.667
It's bigger than you think.

14:57.750 --> 15:02.000
Here's the address.
Be there at 10:00 sharp.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.000
Cape Suzette Nationel Bank.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.583
Shouldn't there be two As in "national"?

15:16.667 --> 15:19.750
I was in a hurry.

15:27.625 --> 15:30.208
[Baloo] Babyface will walk in there,

15:30.291 --> 15:34.083
get himself arrested,
and we'll collect the reward money.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.417
Somebody say money?

15:37.041 --> 15:39.959
Ahem. Babyface, here's the plan.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.458
Go and crack the safe.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.709
What about you?

15:43.792 --> 15:47.875
Wait out here and watch
because I'm the boss, see?

15:49.792 --> 15:50.667
[gasp]

15:50.750 --> 15:52.208
I give orders.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.542
You're just the help, see?

15:54.625 --> 15:56.959
[Kit] Psst! Baloo! Psst!

15:58.625 --> 16:02.041
I'm so tough my mustache is scared.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.583
You're no mobster.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.291
You're that pilot clown.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.208
Hey, what's the racket?

16:16.792 --> 16:19.208
There he is! Get him!

16:20.291 --> 16:22.583
It's Baloo The Desperado.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.250
[officers grunt]

16:32.000 --> 16:33.166
That was close.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.834
We've got to lead them to the hideout.

16:36.917 --> 16:37.875
Oh.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.542
I'll try waking them.
You go get the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

16:45.375 --> 16:48.500
Wake up. Please, you got to wake up!

17:12.916 --> 17:14.290
[loud thud]

17:39.959 --> 17:41.208
Free doughnuts.

17:42.917 --> 17:43.792
It... It's him!

17:45.208 --> 17:47.583
This time we stop him for good.

17:54.875 --> 17:56.583
[siren blaring]

17:57.583 --> 18:00.750
We got to get Half Nelson
before he skips town.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.417
[Rebecca] We'll never catch him.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.834
He's in the sewer.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.291
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

18:14.542 --> 18:16.375
[officer 2] He's in the sewer.

18:16.875 --> 18:20.125
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.875
Calling all cars.

18:47.959 --> 18:52.083
<i>Suspect headed toward</i>
<i>fifth and sewer under Main.</i>

18:52.166 --> 18:53.583
<i>Attempt to intercept.</i>

19:05.709 --> 19:07.083
What's up ahead?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.417
It's not a welcoming committee.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.333
Red means stop!

19:13.417 --> 19:16.500
[Baloo] For cars. We're in a plane.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.417
Watch for that birch!

19:50.875 --> 19:53.041
[yelling]

19:54.792 --> 19:57.667
Maybe we should turn ourselves in.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.458
Lighten up, Becky. There's nothing left.

20:00.542 --> 20:03.041
They've thrown
everything but the kitchen sink.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.542
Look out!

20:05.875 --> 20:09.542
-I wish you hadn't said that.
-Could have been a bathtub.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.333
Will you be quiet?

20:30.750 --> 20:33.375
I'm almost home, ma!

20:34.041 --> 20:34.875
Huh?

20:36.625 --> 20:38.458
[laughing]

20:38.542 --> 20:41.458
So long, suckers!

20:42.542 --> 20:44.041
[all screaming]

20:47.208 --> 20:48.959
[siren blaring]

20:51.709 --> 20:53.875
[Babyface screaming]

20:53.959 --> 20:56.166
[crash]

21:02.166 --> 21:05.208
Oh, I just swept this place.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.375
[crash]

21:12.625 --> 21:15.250
[Baloo] Whoo-ha! We got them!

21:21.625 --> 21:27.000
Here's your reward for the capture
of Babyface Half Nelson and his gang.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.417
Thanks.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.834
I told you I wasn't a criminal.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.083
Hey! My reward money.

21:33.166 --> 21:37.333
Which should about cover
your parking tickets.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.500
You got me.

21:39.583 --> 21:43.709
I'll never break another small law
as long as I live.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.166
You learned little crimes are real crimes?

21:47.250 --> 21:49.875
No. Because it's too expensive.
