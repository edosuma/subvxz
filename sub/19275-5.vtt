00:00.829 --> 00:02.713
<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:02.713 --> 00:03.958
Yes, Doctor, we're on schedule.

00:03.958 --> 00:05.333
I have a concern.

00:05.335 --> 00:07.168
Is she getting distracted?

00:07.170 --> 00:08.269
Are you attracted to me?

00:10.239 --> 00:12.640
I almost jumped you at the coffee shop,

00:12.642 --> 00:15.910
- first time we met.
- Oh.

00:15.912 --> 00:17.912
I drive up and there's
some strange guy here,

00:17.914 --> 00:19.347
- touching your face.
- Just because we had

00:19.349 --> 00:21.415
one awkward dinner
and you grabbed my tit,

00:21.417 --> 00:23.618
doesn't give you the
right to be an asshole.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.119
Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.

00:25.121 --> 00:29.023
Hello, Maddie. I'm Lenny Cohen.

00:29.025 --> 00:31.692
This is Florence Hayes, our new IT man.

00:31.694 --> 00:34.428
- It symbolizes what?
- The wanderer

00:34.430 --> 00:36.664
who finally stopped his wondering.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.084
I did get this.

00:38.267 --> 00:40.301
Now we can track her
through her IP address.

00:40.303 --> 00:41.836
- Oh, my God, she opened it.
- Is it working?

00:41.838 --> 00:44.305
- What's happening?
- Seattle.

00:44.307 --> 00:47.074
- She's in Seattle.
- We're gonna need more money.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.315
- Do you work for the Doctor?
- No, sir.

00:54.317 --> 00:56.550
- Ah!
- Mr. Heller?

01:02.392 --> 01:04.325
Get out of here. Get out of here.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:33.356 --> 01:36.824
First dead body?

01:36.826 --> 01:39.694
Yeah.

01:39.696 --> 01:42.096
When's she getting here?

01:42.098 --> 01:44.331
Soon.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.200
She'll be here soon.

02:00.249 --> 02:02.183
It's late for you to
be out here, isn't it?

02:02.185 --> 02:04.885
My dad said I'm allowed
to patrol the alley.

02:04.887 --> 02:06.454
- Oh.
- Are you a good guy

02:06.456 --> 02:10.257
- or a bad guy?
- I'm not a guy at all.

02:10.258 --> 02:14.361
Fine. Are you a good girl or a bad girl?

02:14.363 --> 02:18.065
Let me see. Is a shark good or bad?

02:18.067 --> 02:19.900
- Bad.
- Why?

02:19.902 --> 02:21.869
Because it eats people.

02:21.871 --> 02:24.939
So if you're a person, a shark is bad

02:24.941 --> 02:26.707
because it might eat you.

02:26.709 --> 02:28.909
But if you're a shark yourself...

02:28.911 --> 02:30.911
Say, a hungry little
boy shark that likes to

02:30.913 --> 02:33.214
- eat people for snacks...
- If you're bad,

02:33.216 --> 02:35.916
I have to smash you with
my Hammer of Justice.

02:35.918 --> 02:38.619
Oh, please don't smash me
with your hammer of justice.

02:38.621 --> 02:41.388
Are you good or bad?

02:41.390 --> 02:44.725
What if I won't say? Or don't know?

02:44.727 --> 02:47.728
Can your Hammer of Justice
tell if I'm good or bad?

02:47.730 --> 02:49.563
What? No.

02:49.565 --> 02:52.566
My Hammer of Justice
is just, like, my tool.

02:52.568 --> 02:55.736
- I'm Hammer Man.
- Hm.

02:55.738 --> 02:57.247
Look...

02:59.275 --> 03:02.409
Think about it this way, Hammer Man:

03:02.411 --> 03:03.978
I'm a tool, too.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.614
So what do I know
about being good or bad?

03:06.616 --> 03:09.416
- You're no fun.
- Not true, Hammer Man.

03:09.418 --> 03:13.154
First, I get to have so much fun.

03:13.156 --> 03:15.422
I'm like the shark's teeth.

03:15.424 --> 03:18.192
Or that Hammer of
Justice you're holding.

03:18.194 --> 03:20.494
Or maybe I'm like the fire that's burned

03:20.496 --> 03:22.263
since the beginning of time.

03:22.265 --> 03:26.100
No one knows who started it,
and no one can put it out.

03:26.102 --> 03:28.636
But I get to be the fire.

03:28.638 --> 03:33.307
So maybe I'm not good or bad.

03:33.309 --> 03:36.210
I just am.

03:36.674 --> 03:37.444
Sorry.

03:37.446 --> 03:39.980
Was that too poetic?

03:39.982 --> 03:41.782
A bit forced?

03:41.784 --> 03:44.318
All right.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.123
Time for you to go home.

03:47.990 --> 03:53.394
Look, I promise I'll keep
an eye on the alley for you.

03:53.396 --> 03:55.863
Okay? Go on home.

03:55.865 --> 03:58.232
- Go!
- Ah!

04:14.750 --> 04:16.684
Ouch.

04:16.685 --> 04:19.353
I could see why you didn't
want to fuck the guy.

04:19.355 --> 04:21.488
All righty then. Let's do this.

04:27.864 --> 04:30.698
Cheapest flight to
Seattle's $349 one way.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.200
That's just over $1,000
for the three of us.

04:33.202 --> 04:35.369
Jeez, man. Don't forget food and motels

04:35.371 --> 04:37.371
Hey, are you sure you wanna use red?

04:37.373 --> 04:39.406
We always used red for
everything must go sales.

04:39.408 --> 04:41.008
It kinda screams desperation, no?

04:41.010 --> 04:44.378
- Red works, okay?
- All right.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.880
We pull off your little scheme,

04:45.882 --> 04:47.748
we'll be able to buy the tickets

04:47.750 --> 04:49.917
and have enough to live
off of for a while, right?

04:49.919 --> 04:52.186
My little scheme is
actually quite elegant.

04:52.188 --> 04:55.055
It's all about a synchronized
execution of various...

04:55.057 --> 04:56.457
Hey, wouldn't cursive be more effective?

04:56.459 --> 04:58.025
Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying.

04:58.027 --> 04:59.693
- The block letters are so...
- Which one of you guys

04:59.695 --> 05:01.562
went to art school?

05:01.564 --> 05:02.763
Oh, yeah. Me.

05:02.765 --> 05:04.899
Okay, back off. Both of you. Go.

05:04.901 --> 05:06.033
- I got this, okay?
- I'm just trying to...

05:06.035 --> 05:08.569
- Go!
- Okay, okay, fine.

05:08.571 --> 05:10.304
- Fine.
- Hey, you're right

05:10.306 --> 05:11.872
about execution, though, man.

05:11.874 --> 05:13.874
The halfback doesn't stay back to block

05:13.876 --> 05:15.409
or the guys on the sales
floor don't move product,

05:15.411 --> 05:17.711
- doesn't mean a thing, you know?
- Yeah.

05:17.713 --> 05:19.113
- You feel me?
- Yeah, yeah, man.

05:19.115 --> 05:20.581
I feel you. Definitely.

05:22.385 --> 05:24.084
Whoa.

05:24.086 --> 05:27.054
- That's actually really good.
- Totally nailed it.

05:27.056 --> 05:28.856
_

05:44.240 --> 05:47.174
Dad, it's not fair! Mom
said you'd get it for me.

05:47.176 --> 05:49.209
- Everyone has one.
- How many times

05:49.211 --> 05:50.945
do I have to tell you
it's not gonna happen?

05:50.947 --> 05:52.947
Just sit there and wait for
me while I run my errands!

05:52.949 --> 05:55.182
And do not move a muscle!

05:57.586 --> 05:59.453
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

05:59.455 --> 06:01.088
Did he not put my wallet back?

06:01.090 --> 06:02.489
Oh, there it is. Thank God.

06:21.010 --> 06:22.710
Where the hell's Sally?

06:22.712 --> 06:24.845
Check if she got back to you, will you?

06:29.218 --> 06:30.884
Nothing.

06:30.886 --> 06:32.286
I don't know. Maybe she's asleep.

06:32.288 --> 06:33.620
This is not good.

06:33.622 --> 06:35.656
You think maybe it was
someone at the bank?

06:35.658 --> 06:37.992
I mean, we pissed off a lot of people.

06:37.994 --> 06:39.493
Maybe someone over there...

06:39.495 --> 06:41.729
Sally did this. Don't kid yourselves.

06:41.731 --> 06:43.364
No, this is not Sally's style at all.

06:43.366 --> 06:44.898
We shouldn't jump to that conclusion.

06:44.900 --> 06:45.899
I'm thinking it, you're thinking it.

06:45.901 --> 06:47.501
- But...
- Occam's razor.

06:47.503 --> 06:49.470
The simplest explanation
is the correct explanation.

06:49.472 --> 06:52.006
Sally found the Doctor's
money under the floorboard.

06:52.008 --> 06:54.975
Heller found Sally. Violence ensued.

06:54.977 --> 06:56.810
Sally ran off with the Doctor's money.

06:56.812 --> 07:00.214
What do you mean the Doctor's money?

07:00.216 --> 07:02.316
Heller was laundering
money for the Doctor.

07:02.318 --> 07:04.051
He has been for years.
And then he started

07:04.053 --> 07:06.320
- skimming more and more and...
- How did you not tell me this?

07:06.322 --> 07:08.856
- How am I supposed to do my job?
- You didn't need to know!

07:08.858 --> 07:10.524
If I don't know this
kind of information...

07:10.526 --> 07:11.525
No, you just had to
land the guy, that's all.

07:11.527 --> 07:13.727
Kids, shh!

07:13.729 --> 07:17.498
I'm sorry that Heller was
not exactly beloved, okay?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.133
And if someone is holding
some kind of a grudge

07:19.135 --> 07:21.935
and... and knew that he
was keeping money here...

07:21.937 --> 07:24.238
Sally's overcoat?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.774
- Yes.
- Hm. She left it in the hall.

07:28.783 --> 07:29.889
And...

07:31.514 --> 07:35.082
this, in our dead friend's fist.

07:37.053 --> 07:38.585
It's her hair.

07:38.587 --> 07:39.987
Same color, no?

07:43.759 --> 07:46.860
Think it's a little
bit of scalp in there.

07:46.862 --> 07:50.364
Eyes on the prize. Scrub, scrub.

07:50.366 --> 07:52.032
I'm gonna give the
Doctor a ring-a-ding,

07:52.034 --> 07:53.767
figure out how to get you out of

07:53.769 --> 07:57.704
this ridiculous shit show
you've got yourselves in.

07:57.706 --> 07:59.706
Stay tuned.

08:06.215 --> 08:08.782
Okay, a little to the left.
I wanna get Dad's store.

08:15.424 --> 08:16.890
Got it.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.831
- So sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.799
29 years old and still chasing PokÃ©mon.

08:25.801 --> 08:29.470
- My bad.
- Yeah, your bad.

08:31.474 --> 08:34.775
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

08:34.777 --> 08:36.309
Thank you.

08:46.355 --> 08:47.788
Ma'am, sorry to bother you.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.823
- May I see your receipt, please?
- Of course.

08:49.825 --> 08:51.625
Oh, thank you.

08:51.627 --> 08:53.827
- Ooh, an espresso machine, huh?
- Yeah, it's a beauty.

08:53.829 --> 08:55.596
Oh, it's lovely. All right.

08:55.598 --> 08:57.998
- Well, you have a great day.
- I will. Thank you.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.811
Hi. This was a birthday
gift from my husband.

09:10.813 --> 09:12.713
It's a beautiful machine, but I think

09:12.715 --> 09:15.015
it's a little extravagant
for our budget.

09:15.017 --> 09:17.017
No problem. Do you have your receipt?

09:17.019 --> 09:18.719
Yes, I do.

09:25.294 --> 09:26.827
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

09:26.829 --> 09:28.662
- I'm so sorry
- What a klutz.

09:28.664 --> 09:29.897
- I know, I'm such an idiot.
- You know what, my grandma

09:29.899 --> 09:31.565
says seltzer's the best on a stain.

09:31.567 --> 09:32.799
Why don't we just take it off?

09:32.801 --> 09:34.168
I'm gonna get some more towels.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.536
Please, you're only making it worse.

09:35.538 --> 09:36.870
- Okay.
- All right, I'll be right back.

09:36.872 --> 09:38.172
- We'll have towels
- Okay, okay.

09:38.174 --> 09:39.806
That's not gonna work on this shade.

09:39.808 --> 09:42.676
How long is that flight?

09:42.678 --> 09:47.147
Okay, yeah. Let's go ahead and
book those three coach tickets.

09:47.149 --> 09:48.916
Yes, the number is

09:49.265 --> 09:55.189
4012-7496-2390-5185.

09:55.191 --> 09:57.958
Oh, uh, the zip code is 17902.

09:59.695 --> 10:02.930
Perfect. Yeah. Thank you very much.

10:02.932 --> 10:04.331
Hey, how much is it to upgrade?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.733
Yeah, let's go ahead and make it
three first class tickets.

10:06.735 --> 10:08.769
There we go, almost good as new.

10:08.771 --> 10:10.537
Incredible. Thank you, I think.

10:10.539 --> 10:11.672
- See? What'd I tell you?
- Yeah, no problem.

10:11.674 --> 10:13.207
Seltzer water. Grandma knows best.

10:13.209 --> 10:14.608
- Here we go.
- The apple doesn't fall far

10:14.610 --> 10:15.876
- from the tree.
- Thanks.

10:15.878 --> 10:17.344
- I have a big meeting.
- Oh, good.

10:17.346 --> 10:18.579
- Well have a great one.
- Thank you.

10:18.581 --> 10:20.080
Yeah, you keep rocking that seersucker.

10:20.082 --> 10:21.281
- Sorry, yeah, I'm so clumsy.
- Such a klutz.

10:21.283 --> 10:23.383
No worries, I think you saved it.

10:31.099 --> 10:33.834
Tell me about Gary Heller.

10:33.836 --> 10:35.936
- He was the kind of guy...
- Maddie first.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.541
He was, um...

10:44.520 --> 10:47.814
Go on, take a breath. Use
your head, not your heart.

10:47.816 --> 10:50.751
Hon, keep talking.

10:50.753 --> 10:52.753
He liked darts.

10:52.755 --> 10:55.188
Not helpful.

10:55.190 --> 10:57.924
He had his gallbladder removed,

10:57.926 --> 11:01.228
- liked dumplings... I don't...
- Charming.

11:01.556 --> 11:02.718
Max, your turn.

11:02.748 --> 11:04.748
Well, thank you.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.784
He had a bunch of kinda
sad dating profiles.

11:07.786 --> 11:11.355
And he was looking into
Russian mail-order brides

11:11.357 --> 11:14.458
before Miss Saffron Keyes
here waltzed into his life.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.193
Mm. Much better. What else?

11:16.195 --> 11:18.762
He was not well liked at work.

11:18.764 --> 11:20.063
Because?

11:20.065 --> 11:21.598
- He was a dick.
- He could be a dick.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.100
Hm.

11:23.102 --> 11:27.371
It's getting better all the time.

11:27.373 --> 11:30.540
Now here's the play:

11:30.542 --> 11:32.309
We finish here.

11:32.311 --> 11:34.464
You leave your scrubs and you go home.

11:36.448 --> 11:38.048
Throw away the clothes you're wearing

11:38.050 --> 11:40.584
in the same bag as some kitchen garbage.

11:40.586 --> 11:42.653
Whatever your day was supposed to be

11:42.655 --> 11:45.055
is still what your day will be.

11:45.057 --> 11:46.623
You will go to work.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.458
You will do all the things you would do

11:48.460 --> 11:51.261
- if your boss didn't show up.
- Any word from Heller?

11:51.263 --> 11:52.329
There's absolutely no way we can push

11:52.331 --> 11:53.930
that 10:00 conference call.

11:53.932 --> 11:55.999
I left him a message
at home and on his cell,

11:56.001 --> 11:57.934
but I'll try again now.

11:57.936 --> 11:59.336
- Well, let me know.
- Okay.

11:59.338 --> 12:00.660
Please leave a message.

12:01.507 --> 12:04.107
Hi, Mr. Heller. Just checking in again.

12:04.109 --> 12:06.243
Your 10:00 call is still on,

12:06.245 --> 12:08.412
so let me know if you
need anything at all.

12:08.666 --> 12:12.082
Max, check the hospitals.

12:12.084 --> 12:13.984
- Check her apartment.
- The number you have reached

12:13.986 --> 12:15.352
is no longer in service.

12:15.354 --> 12:17.354
She's injured and scared.

12:17.356 --> 12:19.156
But she's not in trouble.

12:19.158 --> 12:20.311
Yes, I wonder if you could help me.

12:20.311 --> 12:21.650
I'm looking for a woman
who might have been

12:21.650 --> 12:22.955
treated at your facility at 5'7...

12:22.955 --> 12:25.391
Find her. Don't let her leave.

12:25.582 --> 12:29.366
It's only dangerous
for her if she leaves.

12:29.368 --> 12:32.102
This afternoon, a package from
an associate of the Doctor's

12:32.104 --> 12:33.770
will arrive at the bank

12:33.772 --> 12:37.274
addressed to Heller,
care of Saffron Keyes.

12:37.276 --> 12:38.942
- Here you go.
- It will contain

12:38.944 --> 12:41.845
everything we need to
resolve the situation.

12:41.847 --> 12:44.548
If you stay calm, if you keep your wits

12:44.550 --> 12:48.385
and do exactly as I
say, all will be well.

12:48.387 --> 12:50.887
Just do your job.

12:53.459 --> 12:55.559
No, for a second, the card
actually slipped out of my hand.

12:55.711 --> 12:57.160
It was like slow motion.

12:57.162 --> 12:58.962
It was in the air and
boom, I snatched it back.

12:58.964 --> 13:01.031
- Odell Beckham Jr. style.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13:01.033 --> 13:02.966
Practice pays off, man. Good shit.

13:02.968 --> 13:04.634
Oh, you're all grown up.
We're so proud of

13:04.636 --> 13:06.136
our little mastermind.

13:06.138 --> 13:08.505
Get off, man. Stop screwing around.

13:08.507 --> 13:11.508
I gotta say, that was fun as F.

13:11.510 --> 13:14.911
- I like being a master criminal.
- I do too.

13:14.913 --> 13:16.246
Are we terrible people?

13:16.248 --> 13:18.148
Do you feel like a terrible person?

13:18.150 --> 13:20.717
I actually don't at all.

13:20.719 --> 13:22.252
- Do you?
- No.

13:22.254 --> 13:24.388
Get busy living or get
busy dying, am I right?

13:24.390 --> 13:26.923
Exactly. And that's
why we have the code,

13:26.925 --> 13:29.559
and now we get to
confront the real criminal,

13:29.561 --> 13:30.861
Maddie Jonson.

13:30.863 --> 13:32.863
No "H" in Jonson.

13:32.865 --> 13:36.197
We could be in the same room
with her in six, seven hours.

13:37.736 --> 13:39.040
Jesus.

13:39.772 --> 13:40.836
Wow.

14:17.543 --> 14:19.876
Amaretto rocks.

14:19.878 --> 14:21.411
You remember that?

14:21.413 --> 14:24.614
You must be really good at your job.

14:24.616 --> 14:28.318
I actually suck at my job,
but I remember you.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.887
About a week ago, in
that corner over there.

14:30.889 --> 14:34.991
A bunch of college girls.
Amaretto rocks.

14:34.993 --> 14:36.270
College girls?

14:37.095 --> 14:39.830
I've been out of college for years.

14:39.832 --> 14:41.131
College-looking girls.

14:41.133 --> 14:44.434
Girls who, like, went
to college, you know?

14:44.436 --> 14:47.971
Yeah, just some old friends.
I don't see them a lot.

14:47.973 --> 14:49.506
You don't have to
apologize for your friends.

14:49.508 --> 14:51.608
I was just being a dick.

15:02.692 --> 15:07.123
Would you settle me up, please?

15:07.125 --> 15:10.694
- Aww.
- Why? You like being a dick?

15:10.696 --> 15:12.025
Sometimes.

15:13.198 --> 15:15.332
Come on, I'm harmless.

15:20.606 --> 15:24.441
Hey, you're Jules Langmore?

15:24.443 --> 15:27.777
- Yeah. Why?
- Jules Langmore the artist?

15:27.779 --> 15:29.779
I am, yeah.

15:29.781 --> 15:34.618
- But... wait, what?
- Yeah, I saw your show.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.154
- The one on Perk Haus on...
- On Stanhope.

15:38.156 --> 15:39.789
Yeah. Yeah, that was you, right?

15:39.791 --> 15:42.025
- That was your show?
- Hardly my show.

15:42.027 --> 15:44.528
I mean, just 'cause the
coffee shop puts your art up

15:44.530 --> 15:45.729
because your friend works there...

15:45.731 --> 15:47.297
I don't know shit about art,

15:47.299 --> 15:50.367
but those little box thingies
you make, that is dope.

15:51.305 --> 15:53.837
It's like when you hear
a great song for the first time

15:53.839 --> 15:56.840
and you go, "What the
fuck is that?" you know?

15:56.842 --> 16:00.010
- Do I sound like an idiot?
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.

16:00.012 --> 16:04.548
Thanks. I'm so flattered. I...

16:04.550 --> 16:07.183
I'm Jules.

16:07.185 --> 16:08.418
Cece.

16:14.993 --> 16:20.430
I... I didn't mean to be rude, before.

16:20.432 --> 16:23.533
I can be really aggro with pretty girls.

16:23.535 --> 16:25.502
- Sorry.
- No, don't...

16:25.504 --> 16:28.271
Don't apologize; you're fine.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.273
I mean, if you love my art,
you must be crazy, but...

16:30.275 --> 16:32.208
Don't do that.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.978
You're good. End of story.

16:39.851 --> 16:43.520
You know I came here to see you, right?

16:44.068 --> 16:47.057
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:47.059 --> 16:50.093
What? You think I got out
early on a Saturday night

16:50.095 --> 16:52.514
without my minions of
rich girls to protect me?

16:52.531 --> 16:53.722
I don't know your life.

16:54.032 --> 16:55.632
Well, I don't.

16:58.437 --> 17:00.103
Well, I'll drink to that.

17:02.874 --> 17:05.040
Jules Langmore

17:05.042 --> 17:06.977
came to find me.

17:06.979 --> 17:08.278
Whoo!

17:11.215 --> 17:12.248
Shit.

17:21.593 --> 17:22.826
- Come on.
- Don't you have to be

17:22.828 --> 17:24.728
- behind the bar?
- What?

17:24.730 --> 17:26.730
Don't you have to be behind the bar?

17:26.732 --> 17:29.099
No, I think I'm gonna quit tomorrow.

17:29.101 --> 17:30.734
- What?
- You can't quit.

17:30.736 --> 17:32.936
- Why not?
- You just... you can't.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.170
I don't know.

17:34.172 --> 17:36.239
âª Blink at me, good âª

17:36.241 --> 17:38.141
âª Look to the right âª

17:38.243 --> 17:40.343
âª Look to the right âª

17:40.345 --> 17:42.546
âª Let me get a close-up âª

17:42.648 --> 17:44.948
âª Let me get a close-up âª

17:44.950 --> 17:46.850
âª On your knees âª

17:46.852 --> 17:49.085
âª Roll on over âª

17:49.087 --> 17:51.521
âª Let me get a close-up âª

17:51.523 --> 17:53.423
You wanna go somewhere we can be alone?

17:53.425 --> 17:55.725
We are alone.

17:55.727 --> 17:57.861
âª Look to the right âª

17:57.863 --> 17:59.996
âª Let me get a close-up âª

18:00.098 --> 18:02.332
âª Let me get a close-up âª

18:02.334 --> 18:04.434
âª On your knees âª

18:04.436 --> 18:06.603
âª Roll on over âª

18:06.605 --> 18:08.738
âª Let me get a close-up âª

18:08.840 --> 18:11.174
âª Let me get a close-up âª

18:17.449 --> 18:18.715
âª Are you ready? âª

18:22.020 --> 18:23.053
What the fuck?

18:23.055 --> 18:25.388
Stop! What are you doing?

18:25.390 --> 18:28.658
Cece! Cece!

18:28.660 --> 18:30.527
Get the fuck out of my dream.

18:37.636 --> 18:39.202
Hey, guys, guys.

18:39.204 --> 18:41.471
- We need a new code.
- What? Why?

18:41.473 --> 18:44.674
Come on, relax. The ATM
guy was a definite asshole.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.176
And the seersucker
guy will get reimbursed

18:46.178 --> 18:47.510
by his credit card company.

18:47.512 --> 18:48.745
Don't use that soothing Ezra tone.

18:48.747 --> 18:50.313
- I hate that tone.
- Sorry, jeez.

18:50.315 --> 18:53.483
I'm not talking about a grifter's code.

18:53.485 --> 18:55.051
Wha...

18:55.053 --> 18:56.519
We need a Maddie code.

18:57.698 --> 18:59.906
What does that even
mean, the Maddie code?

19:00.150 --> 19:02.588
We have no idea what seeing
her is gonna do to us.

19:02.962 --> 19:05.353
I do. I'm gonna get my money back...

19:05.355 --> 19:06.855
Okay, no, don't. Don't pretend like

19:06.857 --> 19:08.656
this is someone who
stole your lunch money.

19:08.658 --> 19:10.158
This is your ex-wife.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.496
Your shape-shifting, money stealing,
professional con artist ex-wife.

19:14.498 --> 19:16.931
And mine. And his.

19:16.933 --> 19:18.600
What are you thinking?

19:18.602 --> 19:21.336
Okay, what if she sees me
and declares her love for me

19:21.338 --> 19:22.937
and begs me to leave you
two schmoes in the dust

19:22.939 --> 19:24.205
- and take off with her?
- How do you know

19:24.207 --> 19:25.540
- she won't do that with me?
- Or me?

19:25.542 --> 19:27.208
I don't. And neither do you.

19:27.210 --> 19:29.043
I mean, you wouldn't do that?

19:29.045 --> 19:30.678
- I wouldn't.
- Would you?

19:30.680 --> 19:32.480
I don't know.

19:32.482 --> 19:34.215
- Would you?
- Guys, come on.

19:34.217 --> 19:35.984
If she comes at me
with that stupid offer,

19:35.986 --> 19:37.585
all Alicey and shit,

19:37.587 --> 19:38.853
is like, "This is the real me.

19:38.855 --> 19:43.057
I wasn't faking it with you."

19:43.059 --> 19:44.826
- Okay, maybe I would consider...
- Jesus, really?

19:44.828 --> 19:47.061
- What is with you two?
- Oh, come on, Ezra.

19:47.063 --> 19:48.696
She speaks a little Francois to you,

19:48.698 --> 19:50.298
you're gonna pop a chub so fast

19:50.300 --> 19:52.600
- you're not even gonna know...
- She's not Eva.

19:52.602 --> 19:54.202
I know you guys better than I know her.

19:54.204 --> 19:56.871
Maybe. Probably. But
what if she's more Eva

19:56.873 --> 19:59.674
- than anything else?
- She was in the French Club.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.075
The point is, all we
really know about her

20:01.077 --> 20:02.377
is that she's better than us.

20:02.379 --> 20:04.702
She's a master. I mean, she could
turn us against each other.

20:04.702 --> 20:06.723
We really don't know
what she's capable of.

20:06.723 --> 20:08.064
You're right.

20:09.453 --> 20:10.452
Yeah, she's right.

20:10.454 --> 20:13.288
We need a Maddie code.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.858
No contacting her...

20:16.860 --> 20:18.860
on our own.

20:18.862 --> 20:20.529
No alone time.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.433
- No sex.
- Uh, I think we could...

20:25.435 --> 20:27.869
No sex.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.075
Jesus.

21:11.048 --> 21:13.081
Come on, come on.

21:18.388 --> 21:20.155
Hi.

21:20.157 --> 21:21.723
I'm good. Kinda crazy right now.

21:21.725 --> 21:23.002
Can I call you back?

21:24.494 --> 21:25.861
Bye.

21:59.129 --> 22:00.996
How's your day going?

22:07.104 --> 22:10.438
Train 457
departing to San Francisco.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.107
Will be boarding on platform four.

22:12.109 --> 22:15.377
It's now leaving at 1:55.

22:15.379 --> 22:18.246
Train 457 departing to San Francisco.

22:18.248 --> 22:23.251
Is now leaving at 1:55
p.m. on platform four.

22:23.253 --> 22:25.654
You always liked
trains best, didn't you?

22:30.594 --> 22:32.594
Max.

22:35.899 --> 22:38.133
That looks like it hurts pretty bad.

22:38.135 --> 22:39.968
You should see the other guy.

22:39.970 --> 22:41.336
I did.

22:44.908 --> 22:47.842
- How much?
- About 300 grand.

22:47.844 --> 22:48.977
I found them under the floorboard

22:48.979 --> 22:50.946
a couple of weeks ago.

22:50.948 --> 22:53.381
That's when I knew this was
not a run-of-the-mill gig,

22:53.383 --> 22:55.016
was it, Max?

22:56.987 --> 22:58.653
I didn't tell you because
the Doctor thought...

22:58.655 --> 23:00.922
Screw the Doctor, to
quote our dear girl Maddie.

23:00.924 --> 23:02.657
- Sal.
- We went with them

23:02.659 --> 23:04.926
because we thought that
would make life easier,

23:04.928 --> 23:06.494
give us more freedom.

23:06.496 --> 23:08.496
That's not how it turned out, is it?

23:08.498 --> 23:10.198
I don't know.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.499
We have a good setup.

23:11.501 --> 23:13.201
Security, protection.

23:13.203 --> 23:15.337
At what cost, Max?

23:15.339 --> 23:18.206
You're 60 years old and you
answer to him like you're a kid.

23:18.208 --> 23:21.176
You don't think that doesn't
kill me a little bit every day?

23:21.178 --> 23:23.845
Well this is the life we chose.

23:23.847 --> 23:25.647
It's not who you are.

23:25.649 --> 23:27.615
You never would have
kept secrets from me.

23:27.617 --> 23:28.817
Not like this.

23:28.819 --> 23:31.953
What am I supposed to do here, Sal?

23:31.955 --> 23:35.457
I don't know.

23:35.459 --> 23:37.692
If you turn me in, he'll kill me.

23:42.566 --> 23:44.532
I'm not gonna turn you in.

23:44.534 --> 23:48.837
Then what? Hm?

23:48.839 --> 23:51.281
Don't you ever think about getting out?

23:53.010 --> 23:55.089
Yeah, once in a while, sure.

23:56.179 --> 24:00.048
The grift, the life...

24:00.050 --> 24:02.183
that is who I am.

24:02.185 --> 24:05.854
Once upon a time we had something.

24:05.856 --> 24:09.057
Maybe you were too
proud to give in to it.

24:09.059 --> 24:11.593
Maybe I screwed things up in Tulsa.

24:11.595 --> 24:13.695
But we had something.

24:13.697 --> 24:15.764
Come with me, Max.

24:15.766 --> 24:21.369
We can try again and see what
happens, just the two of us.

24:21.371 --> 24:23.204
Come with me.

24:25.675 --> 24:27.542
He'll look for us and he'll never stop.

24:27.544 --> 24:29.611
I don't like the train
idea. I think we drive.

24:29.613 --> 24:31.079
It's three hours to the
border. We'll put the money

24:31.081 --> 24:33.381
in a spare tire like we
did in Sarasota that time.

24:33.383 --> 24:35.283
I'm gonna need 20 minutes
to get my stuff together.

24:35.285 --> 24:37.185
We're gonna have to
move as fast as possible,

24:37.187 --> 24:38.753
given the Heller situation.

24:38.755 --> 24:41.423
Who knows who the cops
are gonna be talking to.

24:41.425 --> 24:43.191
- What?
- I love it

24:43.193 --> 24:45.760
when you get all riled up.

24:45.762 --> 24:47.796
It's always been you, Sal.

24:47.798 --> 24:49.864
You know that, don't you?

24:49.866 --> 24:51.800
Max.

25:09.609 --> 25:12.076
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey.

25:12.076 --> 25:13.789
So sorry I'm late.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.289
It's okay.

25:17.351 --> 25:18.950
So glad you called. I wasn't sure

25:18.952 --> 25:21.219
I was gonna hear from
you after yesterday.

25:21.221 --> 25:23.655
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

25:23.657 --> 25:27.025
Maybe I overreacted.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.161
But I just didn't know
that you and he were...

25:29.163 --> 25:31.363
We're not.

25:31.365 --> 25:35.534
It's just a little more
complicated than it seems.

25:35.536 --> 25:39.070
Okay, well maybe you
should tell me about it.

25:39.072 --> 25:41.006
Trust me, I don't
really, really want to.

25:41.008 --> 25:44.309
But right now, I don't wanna lie to you

25:44.311 --> 25:47.679
- and I can't tell you the truth.
- Yeah.

25:47.681 --> 25:50.782
Okay. Guess there's nothing I can do.

25:53.387 --> 25:57.322
Well you can maybe take
me back to your place.

25:57.324 --> 26:00.358
Curl up on the sofa. Order a pizza.

26:04.064 --> 26:07.599
You are always asking
for the impossible.

26:11.839 --> 26:13.271
- Thank you.
- There you go.

26:13.273 --> 26:17.442
So are you feeling
Neapolitan or Sicilian?

26:17.444 --> 26:18.877
Ah, but first, you know what?

26:18.879 --> 26:20.447
I'm gonna get a fire going.

26:21.782 --> 26:22.806
Hey.

26:24.355 --> 26:26.885
Yeah.

26:26.887 --> 26:28.386
Come here.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.894
How's this?

26:35.896 --> 26:37.128
Closer.

27:50.137 --> 27:53.672
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Shh.

27:53.674 --> 27:58.176
Just a little longer
without words, please.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.678
Thank you.

28:02.950 --> 28:04.749
It's beautiful.

28:09.189 --> 28:10.989
It's from an old lover.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.724
That's okay.

28:12.726 --> 28:14.526
You can tell me.

28:14.528 --> 28:16.394
And trust me, I have stories.

28:16.396 --> 28:17.936
Oh, I bet you do.

28:20.500 --> 28:24.769
He gave it to me and
made up this stupid story

28:24.771 --> 28:27.138
about a wanderer.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.174
- A wanderer?
- Yeah, he said that

28:29.176 --> 28:32.844
he was a wanderer, traveling through

28:32.846 --> 28:38.316
the dating wilderness until he met me.

28:38.318 --> 28:41.086
And what happened?

28:41.088 --> 28:45.590
Turned out I wasn't
done with my wandering.

28:45.592 --> 28:50.161
After it ended, I couldn't
get the clasp to open and...

28:50.163 --> 28:54.099
just kinda got used to having it on.

28:54.101 --> 28:56.368
Or maybe I was just
not ready to let him go.

28:59.873 --> 29:01.940
What you doing?

29:01.942 --> 29:06.845
It is a tricky little sucker, isn't it?

29:06.847 --> 29:08.813
Oh. Boom.

29:11.551 --> 29:12.984
There you go.

29:16.790 --> 29:18.623
Now you can move on.

29:23.864 --> 29:25.330
Boom.

29:31.805 --> 29:34.406
Who does a girl gotta screw
to get a scotch in this joint?

29:37.444 --> 29:39.277
That'll be me.

29:52.092 --> 29:54.092
Tell me again how this is going to work.

29:54.094 --> 29:55.326
'Cause I'm still not convinced

29:55.328 --> 29:56.728
we should get in bed with this guy.

29:56.730 --> 29:58.129
All I'm saying is what he's offering

29:58.131 --> 29:59.564
makes sense for both of us.

29:59.566 --> 30:01.066
And his whole model... his genius...

30:01.068 --> 30:03.234
is that it's Internet-based.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.469
That's how he found us.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.405
That's how he gets this information
for potential marks.

30:07.407 --> 30:10.508
The financial information...
Just everything.

30:10.510 --> 30:13.244
- I don't know, Maxie.
- The old timers

30:13.246 --> 30:15.146
that we learned from,
they just go to a new town,

30:15.148 --> 30:17.649
trick up a driver's license
or a Social Security card

30:17.651 --> 30:18.917
and bingo, they're in.

30:18.919 --> 30:20.085
Well, not anymore.

30:20.087 --> 30:21.686
You know, not anymore... These days,

30:21.688 --> 30:23.588
- you need infrastructure.
- But some stranger

30:23.590 --> 30:24.956
behind a computer somewhere?

30:24.958 --> 30:26.458
I like to know who I'm working with.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.660
I mean, what kind of doctor is he?

30:28.662 --> 30:30.695
He didn't say and I didn't ask.

30:30.697 --> 30:32.363
He just said to call him the Doctor.

30:32.365 --> 30:35.467
Okay, well that's just creepy.

30:35.469 --> 30:37.202
I've been in business
with shadier people.

30:37.204 --> 30:39.938
And Sy Roberts vouches
for us and Sy is a rock.

30:39.940 --> 30:42.107
- You know that.
- And too good to be true

30:42.109 --> 30:44.109
is too good to be true every time.

30:44.111 --> 30:46.010
Yeah, right, right. But times change.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.979
And we have to adapt.
This could be our chance

30:47.981 --> 30:50.815
- at the big time.
- Such a big dreamer.

30:50.817 --> 30:52.817
Okay, so sue me. I'm excited.

30:52.819 --> 30:55.120
My mother said I was unduly exuberant.

30:55.122 --> 30:56.688
Here, sit down.

30:58.225 --> 31:01.893
Sal, I'm good at this,
you're good at this.

31:01.895 --> 31:05.463
When we work together, it's dynamite.

31:05.465 --> 31:06.731
I don't disagree.

31:06.733 --> 31:09.200
Hey, come on. He gave us a year out.

31:09.202 --> 31:11.669
If we're not happy in
a year, we walk away.

31:11.671 --> 31:13.972
And who knows, we might end up

31:13.974 --> 31:16.441
on some beach together somewhere.

31:16.443 --> 31:19.077
Oh, man, you're really worked up.

31:19.079 --> 31:23.414
- The beach!
- 12:00, about 30 paces out.

31:23.416 --> 31:26.457
Got him. All right.

31:27.220 --> 31:29.687
Lay one on me, baby.

31:35.095 --> 31:36.828
We're certainly dynamite at this part.

31:43.424 --> 31:44.235
Oh, my...

31:44.237 --> 31:45.703
- Easy.
- Oh, my goodness.

31:45.705 --> 31:47.338
Was that me? That was embarrassing.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.140
- Are you all right?
- Whoa, whoa.

31:49.142 --> 31:50.542
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you all right?

31:50.544 --> 31:53.444
I'm fine. I apologize. Bird watcher.

31:53.446 --> 31:54.712
Aren't you guys staying at The Grand?

31:54.714 --> 31:56.181
- Yeah, we are.
- Oh, so are we.

31:56.183 --> 31:57.949
You gotta let us buy
you a drink tonight.

31:57.951 --> 31:59.350
- It's the least we can do.
- Yeah, promise you,

31:59.352 --> 32:00.451
we're good company.

32:00.453 --> 32:02.053
- I'm Ted.
- I'm Eloise.

32:17.137 --> 32:18.803
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi.

32:18.805 --> 32:21.206
Ready to go?

32:21.208 --> 32:22.740
Let's do it.

32:42.229 --> 32:44.262
Anybody need a ride?

32:48.049 --> 32:50.284
Hello. I'm Sally. And you must be...

32:50.286 --> 32:51.785
Yes, I must be.

32:51.787 --> 32:53.487
And I know who you are.

32:53.489 --> 32:54.822
- Right.
- And this is Max.

32:54.824 --> 32:57.391
- We've met.
- Of course.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.994
Uh, we have the Doctor's
money, right here.

32:59.996 --> 33:01.929
I called Max after Heller attacked me

33:01.931 --> 33:03.898
and we were looking for
you, so you can give it

33:03.900 --> 33:05.566
to the Doctor, so here.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.801
- We're all good.
- In the trunk.

33:17.641 --> 33:20.447
Listen, uh,

33:20.449 --> 33:23.651
I want you to know that, um,
we were never gonna run, okay?

33:23.653 --> 33:26.153
We were just really concerned
about the Heller situation,

33:26.155 --> 33:28.455
you know, and so relieved to see that

33:28.457 --> 33:31.358
you've taken care of it, and...

33:31.360 --> 33:34.695
- Time to go.
- Please, I promise you,

33:34.697 --> 33:36.197
we were never going to run.

33:36.199 --> 33:38.699
You need to stop saying "we."

33:44.507 --> 33:46.307
Maxie.

33:46.309 --> 33:48.442
Rules of the game, Sal.

33:48.444 --> 33:50.911
You knew 'em. You broke 'em.

33:55.318 --> 33:57.151
Get in, Sally.

34:04.493 --> 34:08.963
Chin up, Max. It's better
to be sad than dead.

34:45.568 --> 34:47.900
You're just gonna sneak out, huh?

34:47.902 --> 34:49.837
Didn't wanna wake you.

34:51.815 --> 34:53.107
Come here.

34:58.914 --> 35:00.381
Morning.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.886
That was quite a night.

35:05.888 --> 35:08.722
- Think we should do it again?
- Maybe.

35:08.724 --> 35:12.593
All right, well how about maybe tonight

35:12.595 --> 35:15.696
and then maybe tomorrow?

35:15.698 --> 35:19.380
And then definitely Friday
after your birthday party.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.970
- October 25th, right?
- Yeah.

35:22.972 --> 35:27.141
I'm gonna throw you one kick
ass birthday party, lady.

35:27.143 --> 35:28.809
I don't think so.

35:28.811 --> 35:30.611
I'm not into birthday parties.

35:30.613 --> 35:32.379
I always hated them.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.366
Until you met me.

35:37.050 --> 35:37.785
Yeah.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.254
I don't have a say in this do I?

35:40.256 --> 35:41.989
No.

35:41.991 --> 35:43.123
Have a good day.

35:44.151 --> 35:45.059
Idiot.

36:05.448 --> 36:07.548
Morning, sunshine.

36:22.475 --> 36:24.631
It was a crazy day, yesterday.

36:24.633 --> 36:26.300
- In all my years...
- Max.

36:29.105 --> 36:31.205
Look, I totally get how
after a day like that

36:31.207 --> 36:34.842
a person would need some comfort.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.343
To be held and loved in a world

36:36.345 --> 36:38.112
where love doesn't seem possible.

36:38.114 --> 36:40.781
Or there's only violence
and retribution and betrayal.

36:40.783 --> 36:42.983
You're really laying it on thick.

36:42.985 --> 36:44.852
You're like a daughter to me.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.754
- You know that, don't you?
- And what?

36:46.756 --> 36:49.790
You caught me staying out after curfew?

36:49.792 --> 36:53.694
Get to the point, pops.

36:53.896 --> 36:54.869
Pops?

36:56.532 --> 36:58.532
Oh, that's good.

36:58.534 --> 37:00.801
It's all good.

37:00.803 --> 37:03.070
And this guy, Patrick... that's
his name, Patrick Campbell.

37:03.072 --> 37:05.372
- You know his name.
- The point is,

37:05.374 --> 37:08.308
- you did some good work.
- I wasn't working.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.346
Well, you just didn't
know you were working.

37:16.719 --> 37:20.187
He's an assignment, sweetie pie.

37:20.189 --> 37:22.022
- No.
- Yeah, the Doctor called it in.

37:22.024 --> 37:24.558
- Nope. Not gonna happen.
- He said that Patrick Campbell

37:24.560 --> 37:26.260
could be one of our biggest scores.

37:26.262 --> 37:28.429
The numbers aren't
good; they are amazing.

37:28.431 --> 37:30.431
- Not in a million years, Max.
- Oh, yes,

37:30.433 --> 37:33.267
you most definitely will, and so will I.

37:33.269 --> 37:37.104
Because the payoff...
the payoff is huge.

37:37.106 --> 37:39.239
This is the big one.

37:39.241 --> 37:41.842
- Hazard a guess?
- I give up, Max.

37:41.844 --> 37:43.615
What's the payoff?

37:45.281 --> 37:47.032
We get to live.

37:48.217 --> 37:49.516
We get to keep breathing fresh air

37:49.518 --> 37:51.418
and keep drinking good booze.

37:51.420 --> 37:53.854
Some of us get to keep
screwing handsome, rich men.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.889
At least for a while, anyway.

37:55.891 --> 37:58.025
I figure you'll get
engaged to him in what,

37:58.027 --> 37:59.460
six weeks, tops.

37:59.462 --> 38:00.861
I mean, you're so hot for each other.

38:00.863 --> 38:04.264
Married right away and 28 days later...

38:07.536 --> 38:09.158
It's our lives, Maddie.

38:23.118 --> 38:25.419
So freshen up. Go back to work.

38:25.421 --> 38:27.187
Wait for the flowers to arrive.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.258
What about Sally?

38:31.260 --> 38:32.993
What about her?

38:32.995 --> 38:35.229
She made a big mistake
and he'll find her.

38:35.231 --> 38:37.297
Rest assured, the Doctor will find her.

38:37.299 --> 38:40.100
- And when he does...
- That's it?

38:40.102 --> 38:41.635
You loved her.

38:41.637 --> 38:44.271
Don't even try to tell
me that you didn't.

38:44.273 --> 38:45.906
And?

38:45.908 --> 38:48.075
You love this guy Patrick.

38:48.077 --> 38:49.810
Doesn't change anything.

38:49.812 --> 38:52.012
And don't be arrogant.
This is the life we chose.

38:52.014 --> 38:53.514
There are rules. We
don't get to break them

38:53.516 --> 38:56.016
because we're stupid
enough to fall in love.

38:56.018 --> 38:58.085
Now get going.

38:58.087 --> 38:59.953
I'll see you in the game.

39:06.462 --> 39:09.363
In the game.

39:16.505 --> 39:19.473
Yeah, the mother-effing game.

39:39.259 --> 39:40.758
Yes, ma'am, they were
just following protocol,

39:40.760 --> 39:42.493
but it shouldn't be much...

39:45.865 --> 39:47.799
- Holy shit.
- Andy, what the hell?

39:47.801 --> 39:51.102
- I mean, holy shit, he's gone.
- Andy, Andy, just...

39:51.104 --> 39:53.037
just tell me what's going on.

39:53.039 --> 39:55.506
- Heller bailed, man.
- What do you mean, bailed?

39:55.508 --> 39:58.676
He, like, embezzled a bunch of money
to marry some Russian chick

39:58.678 --> 40:00.778
and they, like, ran off to the Maldives,

40:00.780 --> 40:02.714
where they, like, don't
have extradition or whatever.

40:02.716 --> 40:05.283
Wow.

40:05.285 --> 40:07.852
Gary Heller in the wind, huh?

40:07.854 --> 40:09.854
Yeah. I mean, I never liked the guy,

40:09.856 --> 40:12.390
but yeesh.

40:12.392 --> 40:14.692
Yeesh, indeed, Mr. Wang.

40:14.694 --> 40:16.127
Yeesh, indeed.

40:31.567 --> 40:32.760

40:39.753 --> 40:41.018
Ez.

40:44.057 --> 40:45.723
Hi, Eva.

40:49.395 --> 40:50.828
What are you...

40:56.669 --> 40:59.370
What the f...?

40:59.372 --> 41:01.405
- Alice.
- How did you...

41:01.407 --> 41:03.975
Always forward, never back.

41:08.381 --> 41:09.847
Hey, Ce.
