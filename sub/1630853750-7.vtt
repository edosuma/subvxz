WEBVTT

00:19.644 --> 00:24.899
Oh, the heartbeat.
Strong and steady, just like I like them.

00:26.776 --> 00:30.905
I'll send your blood samples over
to the lab just to make sure,

00:30.989 --> 00:33.825
but heartbeats don't lie.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.454
-That's great.
-It certainly is.

00:37.954 --> 00:42.333
And now that we're settled,
congratulations on the baby.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.169
Thank you.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.047
-But we're not telling--
-No, I won't say a word.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.841
-Thanks.
-Now, you just take it easy today.

00:49.924 --> 00:53.636
-Cameron and I will cover the clinic.
-No, I'm fine. I can work.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.681
You can, but you're not going to.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.853
And I'll give you two a minute,
then just meet up with me in my office.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.525
See? Everything's okay.

01:09.861 --> 01:10.862
Yeah.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.490
-You need anything?
-No.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.620
-No, I'll meet you in there. Okay?
-Okay.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.137
You hungry? I'll make you some eggs.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.848
No, no. I'm not hungry.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.851
Are you still in pain?

01:42.685 --> 01:43.853
No, I'm just tired.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.773
At least everything's okay now.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.693
You think everything's okay?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.112
That's what Doc just said.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.117
He was talking about the baby.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.914
And you're talking about...?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.542
You were passed out.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.086
No, I was asleep.

02:09.921 --> 02:13.341
Jack, I thought I was having a miscarriage

02:13.424 --> 02:16.553
and that I would have
to drive myself to the clinic.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.180
Come on, I was 20 feet away from you.

02:19.264 --> 02:22.100
Physically being someplace
and actually being available

02:22.183 --> 02:23.768
are two different things.

02:31.067 --> 02:31.901
I'm sorry.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.782
Come on, it was an isolated incident.
It's not like it happens every night.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.870
Yeah, I see you.
Whenever you get stressed out, you drink.

02:41.953 --> 02:46.374
Okay. I admit, last night
I went overboard, and I'm sorry.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.794
I'm just worried about you.

02:50.336 --> 02:54.340
Well, you don't need to worry about me.
Okay? I'm fine.

02:55.258 --> 03:00.805
The only thing you need to focus on
is you and our baby.

03:02.265 --> 03:07.520
Jack, can you please stop telling me
you're fine and just talk to me?

03:08.313 --> 03:11.900
You think hearing about things that
stress me out is gonna be good for you?

03:11.983 --> 03:17.780
It's better than you isolating yourself
and drinking until you're unconscious.

03:21.910 --> 03:27.916
Jack, what I'm trying to tell you is that
what you did really scared me.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.835
And it made me feel alone.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.760
I'm really sorry.
That's not how I want you to feel, ever.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.470
I know. I know.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.516
-Who is that?
-I don't know.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.609
Is that your sister?

03:54.692 --> 03:56.152
Yeah. Hi.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.570
Hi!

03:58.154 --> 03:59.656
What are you doing here?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.407
I'm engaged.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.327
Oh.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.080
Hi.

04:09.123 --> 04:09.958
Okay.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.236
Hey. Someone's trying to get ahold of you.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.487
Let them wait!

04:53.876 --> 04:54.836
Hey.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.672
That was fast.
Did I use all the hot water?

04:57.755 --> 05:01.092
Nope, just not as much fun in there
without you.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.972
So I was thinking more
about what happened yesterday.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.058
Calvin called you
all the way to Emerald Lumber,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.477
but he didn't tell you anything
about the drugs?

05:12.395 --> 05:16.941
No, he... Just throwing his weight around.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.485
That just does not track.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.453
-Aren't you gonna check your voicemail?
-Oh, no. Saw who it was. It's nothing.

05:29.454 --> 05:33.750
Mike wanting you to come down
to the sheriff's office is not nothing.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.171
I'm sorry, did you...?
Did you go through my phone?

05:38.254 --> 05:42.175
No, but I saw the lock screen
and I thought it might be important.

05:42.258 --> 05:43.509
Yeah, well, it's not.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.887
How do you know?

05:45.970 --> 05:48.890
Because it's Mike.
If he wants to talk, he can come to me.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.769
What if what he has to talk about
can help you with your case?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.108
Everything's okay with the baby?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.652
Yeah. Everything is fine. It's fine.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.155
They were just cramps,
but that's not how it felt.

06:04.238 --> 06:07.241
-I had those with James. They're scary.
-Yeah.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.161
-I'm still trying to shake it off.
-Yeah, I don't blame you.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.123
Anyway, can you finish
telling me about you and Nate, please?

06:15.041 --> 06:19.337
Okay. All right. You might not remember
because you were, like, 10...

06:19.420 --> 06:21.506
-Mm-hm.
-...but we dated in high school.

06:22.131 --> 06:26.594
Yeah, he was captain of the football team,
class valedictorian.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.889
And the reason we broke up was
we were going to different colleges.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.140
Did you keep in touch?

06:31.224 --> 06:34.811
No, but he heard through a mutual friend
that I got divorced,

06:34.894 --> 06:37.814
and he messaged me on Instagram,

06:37.897 --> 06:40.983
and it turns out
he is divorced and living in L.A.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.529
Okay, so how did that turn into
you getting engaged?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.572
Well, it just felt right.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.034
The first time we went out
was like zero time had passed.

06:50.118 --> 06:50.993
Mm.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.954
How long ago was that?

06:53.037 --> 06:54.080
A month ago.

06:54.163 --> 06:57.291
-Oh.
-I know, and that's not even the big news.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.755
Um, okay, so the big news is that
we are getting married tomorrow

07:02.839 --> 07:05.633
in Clear River,
and I want you to be my maid of honor.

07:05.716 --> 07:09.637
-You're getting married tomorrow?
-Mm-hm. At city hall.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.347
-Oh, my gosh.
-Yeah.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.641
-Hey, ladies.
-Hi.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.768
-Joey, can I steal you away for a bit?
-Yeah.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.562
I wanna check in on the rental.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.940
-I'll text you so we can meet up.
-Okay.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.704
-Well, Joey's getting married tomorrow.
-Tell her I say congratulations.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.249
What? They've been dating for a month.
Can you believe it?

07:38.332 --> 07:40.376
Yeah. That's called a shotgun wedding.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.129
No, a shotgun wedding
is when the bride is pregnant.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.631
Oh, so if you and I got married?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.758
-Can we focus here, please?
-Okay.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.053
Yes. Well, when I proposed,
we hadn't known each other that long.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.223
Yeah, but we weren't gonna get married
two days later.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.350
She's just not thinking straight.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.689
-What?
-I don't know if you wanna get involved.

08:01.772 --> 08:05.318
-You seem upset.
-Of course I'm upset. She's my sister.

08:05.401 --> 08:08.321
I don't want her
making a decision she'll regret.

08:08.404 --> 08:13.284
Try to remember what Doc said, okay?
Don't get too riled up. The baby.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.037
Right. I know, I'm sorry. I'm trying.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.123
What is this? What's with the map?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.876
I'm figuring out what to do with the land.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.837
It'll take a year
to get a permit to rebuild.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.088
What are you thinking?

08:26.172 --> 08:28.925
I don't know, but if I can monetize it,

08:29.008 --> 08:32.470
I can take that cash
and I can build us something new.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.389
-Really? Oh, I like that plan.
-Mm.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.307
Yeah.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.684
-Ah, kiss?
-All right.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.145
-All right. I love you.
-I love you too.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.148
-Go easy!
-I will.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.861
Hey! Mel's sure in a hurry.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.030
-Yeah, don't ask.
-Copy that.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.033
I'll be cutting out at lunch time.
Is that cool?

08:54.116 --> 08:58.329
-Yeah, sure. Something special going on?
-A private aikido lesson from Julia.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.623
Private? Things getting interesting?

09:00.706 --> 09:02.792
Right now, it's just about aikido.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.169
Don't sell yourself short.
I got faith in you.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.733
The remote slipped out of my hand.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.367
-Here.
-Thank you.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.414
-Are you gonna watch something?
-I was going to tape one of my shows.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.748
Do you mind if I try?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.836
Unless you have a Ph.D. in engineering,
I doubt you'll get it to work.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.841
<i>What day is it, Molly?</i>

09:51.924 --> 09:53.884
-Show-off.
-<i>I'm not Molly.</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:58.431
-This one turns the power on.
-I've had this TV for ten years.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.309
Sometimes I need a minute
to get my bearings.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.896
Vernon's at work.
He suggested we have dinner together.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.190
Only if you let me cook.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.610
You sure you're related to Vernon?

10:10.693 --> 10:13.195
You're letting me stay here.
I'd like to contribute.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.114
Do you have soba noodles?

10:15.197 --> 10:19.368
No, but if you come to the bar with me,
Preacher might help you out.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.912
Sounds good. When do you plan on leaving?

10:22.413 --> 10:25.207
As soon as I remember how to tape my show.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.170
-What's it called?
<i>-Jeopardy!</i>

10:29.253 --> 10:33.883
Comes on at 5, Channel 11. Or is it 13?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.136
Channel 13.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.350
Done and done.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.311
All right, Einstein. Let's go.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.527
-Nate didn't wanna come?
-He wanted to. He's just wiped out.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.404
-Oh.
-He did all the driving last night

10:55.488 --> 10:56.489
so I could sleep.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.033
-That's very thoughtful.
-Yeah.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.786
I'm telling you,
he is the opposite of Bill.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.496
He always puts my needs first.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.374
-That's great. Yeah.
-It is.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.504
So why haven't you congratulated me
on my engagement?

11:12.880 --> 11:16.467
-Well... Oh, hold on a second.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.763
-It's Doc. I'm sorry. Just one second.
-Okay.

11:21.555 --> 11:25.267
Hey, Doc. If this isn't an emergency,
can I call you back?

11:25.351 --> 11:29.689
Mel, there has been an accident
out at the Northpoint Deer Stand.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.940
<i>What happened?</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:34.819
I'm not sure. Bert called,
but the cell reception's bad up there.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.696
Okay. What do I need to do?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.699
Hope won't answer the phone,
and I can't reach Denny.

11:39.782 --> 11:44.745
So would you just let them know
that I don't know when I'll be home?

11:44.829 --> 11:47.123
Okay, did you call Emergency Services?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.041
I need to make sure it's warranted.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.796
But if it turns out we need an ambulance,
I'll hike out and call one.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
Okay. What about the clinic?

11:56.173 --> 11:59.969
<i>Nothing on the schedule,</i>
<i>so if you could just be on call...</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:01.303
Of course, no problem.

12:01.804 --> 12:05.307
All right.
I'll do my best to stay in touch.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.607
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.609
I'm sorry about that. Um--

12:15.693 --> 12:18.779
Doc and Cameron
are dealing with an emergency,

12:18.863 --> 12:20.448
so I have to be on call.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.741
-It's okay.
-Yeah.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.077
Why are you so negative about me and Nate?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.706
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be.
I'm trying to be practical.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.458
Look, I know it's sudden.

12:30.541 --> 12:35.129
Right! So all I'm saying is, you know,
maybe just slow it down a little bit.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.216
Why are you so adamant about us waiting?

12:39.300 --> 12:41.761
Because marriage is a really big deal,

12:41.844 --> 12:44.472
and I just don't want you to regret it.

12:44.555 --> 12:48.017
And I don't wanna go through life
being afraid things aren't gonna work out.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.646
I just-- I think you're getting married
because you're afraid of being alone.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.940
Wow. Uh...

12:55.024 --> 12:58.277
Come on. You've been in relationships
since you were 15.

12:58.360 --> 13:04.658
And I didn't go looking for someone.
Okay? Nate just popped back into my life.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.078
I'm not gonna pass on a great guy
just to prove that I can be alone.

13:08.162 --> 13:14.835
I know. I just think there's a difference
between passing and taking things slow.

13:15.836 --> 13:21.717
What does that mean? Taking things slow?
I mean, six months? A year? Five years?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.137
Okay, Joey, will you just ask yourself...

13:27.431 --> 13:29.016
why you're in such a hurry?

13:29.558 --> 13:34.146
I already know the answer.
Love doesn't scare me.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.197
-Hey!
-Oh, there she is.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.282
Aw. I'm so glad you made it.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.617
Me too.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.829
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.540
Sorry I didn't text you back last night.
I was with Hope.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.918
Oh, no worries.
So, what are you doing tonight?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.838
Maybe we could hang out again?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.298
I can't.
I offered to cook Doc and Hope dinner.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.678
-Oh, okay. Yeah.
-Wait, do you wanna join us?

14:06.554 --> 14:09.640
-I'm sure they wouldn't mind.
-That'd be nice.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.893
Great. Oh, is Preacher around?

14:12.977 --> 14:15.896
-He's in the kitchen.
-I'll see you tonight, then.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.446
-That's Doc's grandson?
-Yeah.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.324
-He's hot.
-He's okay.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.368
I don't get him.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.872
Sometimes he's super cool,
other times he acts like we're strangers.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.583
Ah, the classic commitment-phobe.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.587
Men all over the world suffer
from this debilitating condition.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.508
-Do you think that's his problem?
-That, or he's hiding something.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.015
Okay, wait.

14:51.098 --> 14:55.769
So Mel's sister
has only been dating this guy for a month?

14:55.853 --> 14:59.148
That's what she told Shirley
on their way in.

14:59.231 --> 15:00.649
How exciting for her.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.778
You have to go through seasons
with someone before you can know them.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.614
Oh, really? Which ones?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.574
-Tax season.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.492
The holidays. Winter.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.164
Ladies, let's get back to why we're here.
The community garden space for Lilly.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.291
Whatever you wanna do is fine.

15:17.374 --> 15:21.211
Oh, good, because we're gonna
line the entrance pathway

15:21.295 --> 15:23.547
with miniature purple roses.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.801
The succulent garden should go
in the northwest corner of the lot.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.638
Only hard succulents
can survive our winters.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.014
How about petunias?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.807
Petunias are just as bad.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.853
Why don't we just go with
wintergreen boxwoods and call it a day?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.148
You obviously can't do this without me.

15:41.231 --> 15:45.611
Let's start with the soil.
We'll need mulch, wood chips, fertilizer.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.529
And, oh, the four of us,

15:47.613 --> 15:51.533
we'll be meeting up with the contractor
in an hour to discuss the gazebo.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.410
I'd go, but Nick has my car.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.329
I'll drive you.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.790
-You can drive?
-Of course I can.

15:57.873 --> 16:02.294
So I think we should go with stone pavers
rather than brick for the walkway.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.129
Yes. I like that.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.050
-Somebody have paper?
-I'll write it down on my phone.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.849
Now, Brie, why are you here?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.602
-She's the only reason I'm here.
-What's the deal?

16:19.561 --> 16:24.400
Okay, the DA is
charging Jimmy with aggravated mayhem.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.569
He beat some rival pot grower with a hose
until the guy lost an eye.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.155
Hold on. Why is he out of jail?

16:30.739 --> 16:34.952
All pending charges against Emerald Lumber
employees have been dropped.

16:35.035 --> 16:35.869
Dropped?

16:36.912 --> 16:37.955
That's great.

16:38.038 --> 16:42.042
I stick out my neck for you,
you can't even put a case together?

16:42.126 --> 16:45.504
-We had a case, Brady, until you just--
-Me?

16:45.587 --> 16:46.797
-Don't touch me!
-Listen--

16:46.880 --> 16:50.467
Hey, hey, hey,
can we just focus on why we're here?

16:50.551 --> 16:51.385
Yeah.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.345
Aggravated mayhem, that's a felony.

16:53.429 --> 16:57.224
Jimmy's already got two strikes.
So he's facing life in prison.

16:57.307 --> 17:02.563
Mm-hm. So we're offering Jimmy a deal.
In exchange for a new identity,

17:02.646 --> 17:05.899
-he testifies against Calvin.
-Come on. He's never gonna go for that.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.570
Jimmy's a psycho,
yeah, but he's loyal as hell.

17:09.653 --> 17:15.325
Yeah, that's what he told the DA,
which is why I want you to talk to him.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.495
You'd know which buttons to push
to get him to roll.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
It's your call.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.173
How much further?

17:29.256 --> 17:34.011
About four miles. The rest of the way
is pretty rough terrain.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.054
Yeah.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.476
Are we lost?

17:40.559 --> 17:45.439
No, no, but we better get a move on
if we're gonna make it out by nightfall.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.107
And if we don't?

17:47.191 --> 17:50.778
Oh, that'll be a long, long night.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.252
-Malty. Good body. Not bad.
-Yeah?

18:10.672 --> 18:12.132
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.592
Nice surprise.

18:13.675 --> 18:17.429
I was on my way to Hope's.
I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.473
Oh, hang on. Give me a minute.

18:20.057 --> 18:20.891
Sure.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.477
-Ready for your check?
-Yes, please.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.105
You guys staying in town
or passing through?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.148
Passing through. On our way to Washington.

18:28.232 --> 18:33.028
Oh. If you're looking for a place
to crash, we got a great B&B here.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.906
Actually, we're glamping
outside of Portland.

18:35.989 --> 18:36.865
Glamping, huh?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.827
Yeah, we booked this Airstream.
It's pretty cool.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.495
The inside's all art deco.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.247
All our friends swear it's the best.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.873
What's the appeal?

18:44.957 --> 18:48.001
It's cheaper than a hotel
and way more original.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.462
Just plan ahead. They book up fast.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.089
Hmm.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.425
Sounds cool. Enjoy the rest of your trip.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.343
Thanks.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.057
-You want me to get you something to eat?
-No, I gotta get over to Hope's.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.434
Something you wanna talk about?

19:04.518 --> 19:08.063
I wanted your advice, actually,
'cause I went to see Joey,

19:08.147 --> 19:12.526
and I told her that
I think she's afraid of being alone...

19:12.609 --> 19:14.319
-Ooh.
-...which she did not love hearing.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.529
-I bet.
-Yeah.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.699
If I tell her what she wants to hear,
I'd be lying.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.911
Well, as long as you tell her
you're coming from a place of love,

19:22.995 --> 19:24.621
there's not much more you can do.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.582
Yeah. Right.

19:26.665 --> 19:30.878
Oh, hey. If you're heading to Hope's,
do you wanna take that?

19:30.961 --> 19:33.463
-Sure. See you later.
-Thanks.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.634
Hey, Nick.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.179
-Hey, you all set?
-Yep. There you go.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.140
Oh, hey! Wait, wait.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.350
-I wanna ask you something.
-Yeah?

19:46.226 --> 19:48.770
-What do you know about Airstreams?
-Ah, the Silver Bullet.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.440
Say I wanted to set one up on my property.

19:51.523 --> 19:55.194
-How much would it take to get a permit?
-You don't need one.

19:55.277 --> 19:58.322
-I don't?
-No. You'd need sewage disposal,

19:58.405 --> 20:00.824
water supply, an electrical hook-up.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.161
I got everything but the electrical.
But that'd be easy.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.455
Why? You in need of a man cave?

20:06.955 --> 20:09.666
-No, I'm in need of income.
-Ah.

20:10.417 --> 20:14.087
Maybe if I rented one or two out,
it could help offset the mortgage.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.964
You could put four or five on there.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.133
-You think I could make money?
-Yeah.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.677
Enough that I'd be willing
to kick in some capital.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.388
-You being for real?
-Sure am.

20:24.389 --> 20:25.557
That'd be amazing.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.687
We could do guided tours, you know,
like fishing, kayaking.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.397
I know Preacher would be into that.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.360
Why don't you draw up a business plan,
and we'll hash out the details?

20:36.443 --> 20:37.527
Okay.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.615
All right, I'll get that to you
as soon as I can.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.283
All right, I'll be waiting for it.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.416
Your turn, big guy. Let's go.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.670
All right.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.755
Like this?

20:58.006 --> 20:59.841
This, down you go.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
-Perfect. That was perfect.
-Uh-huh.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.140
-Well, I got a great teacher.
-Hmm.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.103
So are you gonna help me up, or...?

21:12.479 --> 21:13.438
Yeah, right.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.695
All right. So are we good to go?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.280
Yeah. Um...

21:22.155 --> 21:24.700
Can I ask you a question first?

21:24.783 --> 21:27.077
-Yeah, sure.
-On our picnic,

21:27.160 --> 21:30.831
there was a drawing
at the bottom of the basket

21:30.914 --> 21:34.543
of you and a little boy and a woman.

21:34.626 --> 21:39.715
Yeah, that was Christopher,
and his mom, Paige.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.341
And how do you know them?

21:42.509 --> 21:45.387
Oh, it's complicated.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.640
Complicated, as in a relationship?

21:48.724 --> 21:52.060
Well, they are no longer in town.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.772
-Are they coming back?
-Honestly, um...

21:56.982 --> 21:58.442
I don't know.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.695
And I'm not really in the position
to discuss it.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.741
Okay. That's cool, I get it.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.453
-I think that's it for our session today.
-Okay.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.581
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a rain check on lunch.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.376
Yeah, okay. Sure.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.005
Text me if you want to schedule
another session, okay?

22:20.922 --> 22:22.674
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.559
-Hi!
-Hi.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.102
So the pie is from Jack.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.564
And since you're not answering your phone,
Doc wanted me to let you know

22:37.647 --> 22:39.983
that he and Cameron
are on their way to Northpoint.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.235
-Okay.
-There's been an accident,

22:42.319 --> 22:44.279
and he doesn't know
what time he'll be home.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.491
-He just doesn't want you to worry.
-I appreciate you letting me know.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.951
Hope. I'm sorry.
Can I come in for a second?

22:50.035 --> 22:52.454
-Of course.
-Thanks.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.624
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.958
I'm fine.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.795
Okay, so no more headaches or memory loss?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.631
-Depends on the day.
-Okay. Well, that's good.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.466
So there has been some progress.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.134
I suppose you could call it that.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.969
I was just about to take a shower,

23:08.053 --> 23:11.223
and I'm sure you must have stuff to do
with your sister.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.350
Wait, how do you know
that my sister's here?

23:14.184 --> 23:15.644
Oh, right.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.104
It's quite the story.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.231
Oh, I'm sure it is.

23:19.314 --> 23:23.110
Yeah, I've been trying to talk her into
holding off on the wedding,

23:23.193 --> 23:25.320
but she's just not listening to me.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.280
So you don't approve.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.658
You know what? It's not that.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.911
Um, Nate seems like
a really nice guy and...

23:33.453 --> 23:35.580
I think he makes Joey happy.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.666
So, what's the problem?

23:37.749 --> 23:38.917
Um...

23:39.793 --> 23:41.920
Well, it's-- I'm just worried...

23:42.546 --> 23:45.632
why she's jumping into something
that's such a huge commitment.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.717
I feel like she's just being reckless.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.302
Is she reckless?

23:49.386 --> 23:52.389
I mean, if you're asking if her life
is a mess, no, it's not.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.600
So even though she's more likely
to jump into something,

23:55.684 --> 23:58.353
for the most part,
things have worked out okay?

23:58.437 --> 24:03.066
Yes, but I think jumping into something
as big as marriage is...

24:03.150 --> 24:05.026
I don't know, it's just crazy to me.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.947
Yeah, I just want to protect her.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.240
I know you do, dear.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.950
But think about this:

24:12.033 --> 24:15.829
Even though you and Joey
don't see the world the same way,

24:15.912 --> 24:18.874
she still managed to build a life
for herself.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.500
Right.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.294
You probably don't know this,

24:22.377 --> 24:24.629
but I'd known Vernon
for about five minutes

24:24.713 --> 24:27.048
when I decided I wanted to marry him.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.426
Mm. But did you act on it?

24:29.509 --> 24:30.719
Married within a month.

24:30.802 --> 24:31.887
No.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.222
Wow, I didn't know that.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.308
So that's why you're on her side.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.769
Honey, I'm on your side.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.688
You've been honest with Joey,

24:41.771 --> 24:44.107
and she's still set on
getting married, right?

24:45.108 --> 24:45.942
Yeah.

24:46.026 --> 24:49.196
So unless you're willing to risk
your relationship on this...

24:50.280 --> 24:51.907
it's time to be supportive.

24:53.366 --> 24:55.744
Right. Yeah, yeah.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.078
That makes sense.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.664
You're right.

25:00.248 --> 25:03.335
-Um, well, thank you for listening.
-You're very welcome.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.713
Now, go have fun with your sister.

25:06.796 --> 25:07.756
Okay.

25:20.435 --> 25:24.022
-Doc! Cameron! Over here!
-Got here as quick as we could.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.982
We were scouting pronghorn.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.319
I climbed down first, by the time
I hit the ground, the floor gave way.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.656
That looks like 12 feet.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.159
Charlie.
I suspect you fractured your tibia.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.828
Hey, Bert, I need you to find me
two thick branches

25:38.912 --> 25:40.705
about the length of Charlie's leg.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.916
Charlie, did you hit your head
when you fell?

25:42.999 --> 25:44.251
Yeah, I saw stars.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.504
Ears are ringing,
my head's just killing me.

25:47.587 --> 25:48.630
-Okay.
-Charlie.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.423
I think you also have a concussion.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.726
Ah. Hey, look what the cat dragged in.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.271
A big, fat rat.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.858
-Where's your lawyer?
-Fired him.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.279
Don't wanna let no one speak for me.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.406
Smart.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.624
You still don't get it, do you?

26:25.375 --> 26:26.585
Get what?

26:27.711 --> 26:28.628
Calvin.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.632
All those times he got you to leave
the room so we could talk business...

26:34.217 --> 26:36.094
what do you think we were talking about?

26:36.177 --> 26:37.554
That's a load of crap.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.180
Calvin wanted to get rid of you.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.890
Said you were a liability.

26:41.474 --> 26:45.020
So you understand why he put
Emerald Lumber in my name.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.397
And not yours.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.775
Man, I'm not cutting a deal,
if that's what you're getting at.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.153
You think I care?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.865
I don't care, Jimmy.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.825
The only reason I'm here...

26:59.534 --> 27:01.244
is to look you in the eye...

27:01.870 --> 27:04.706
and tell you I am walking free.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.125
And you?

27:08.084 --> 27:09.878
You're just a dog in a cage.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.425
Woof.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.182
You know, I wonder,

27:22.265 --> 27:24.100
if Calvin doesn't need you anymore...

27:25.226 --> 27:29.481
how long do you think he waits
until he puts you down?

27:46.206 --> 27:47.499
Hey, tough day?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.669
Yeah, my enlistment contract came in.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.546
Oh. Didn't get what you want?

27:54.631 --> 27:56.216
Actually, I did.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.968
Why are you so bummed?

27:59.052 --> 28:02.305
Well, till today, nothing was real.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.725
What if I'm not tough enough
to be a Marine?

28:05.809 --> 28:07.352
I think you're tough enough.

28:07.435 --> 28:10.397
Jack, look at me.
Do I look like I can fight?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.023
Well, that's what basic's for.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.568
They're gonna teach you combat skills
and the booters are gonna lift you up.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.196
-It's how it works.
-I've heard a lot of people drop out.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.240
What if I just can't hack it?

28:20.323 --> 28:22.826
You'll come back here.
You'll figure something else out.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.621
But you never, never know
if you never, never go.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.706
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.375
Yeah, I'm right.
Now, you deserve to give yourself a shot.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.335
-All right. Thanks, Jack.
-Yeah.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.046
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.924
You're back early. How'd it go with Julia?

28:38.007 --> 28:40.844
Yeah, it was... It was good.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.470
We just had to cut it short.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.181
-Are you gonna hang here a while?
-Mm-hm.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.685
Good. I wanna head up to Baker's Grove
and check out an Airstream.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.437
-Oh.
-Yeah, I'm gonna buy a few.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.563
I'm gonna rent them out,

28:51.646 --> 28:54.899
-and it's gonna cover my mortgage.
-Ah. Hey. I like that.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.234
-Right?
-Yeah.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.819
-Take your time.
-Thanks.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.910
BP's 120 over 90 and heart rate is 118.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.122
Charlie, your blood pressure is normal.

29:09.205 --> 29:12.292
But your heart rate's slightly elevated,
likely due to the pain.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.169
Grab the IM morphine.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.172
Charlie, to stabilize your leg,
we're gonna have to splint it.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.715
I'm not gonna lie to you,

29:18.798 --> 29:21.342
even with morphine,
it's gonna hurt a little bit.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.635
-Yeah.
-All right.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.766
Okay, Charlie.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.020
There we go.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.897
-All right, give me a hand here.
-Yep.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.190
-Stabilize.
-Right.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.067
Ready, Charlie?
Here comes the first one. Now.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.087
-Hey!
-Hey.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.507
-Is Joey around?
-No. She went out for a run.

30:00.590 --> 30:04.260
-Oh, okay. I'll just come back later.
-Did you try calling her?

30:04.344 --> 30:07.472
I did, it just went straight to voicemail.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.808
Is there something
you want me to tell her?

30:11.100 --> 30:13.978
Um, I just owe her an apology.

30:14.062 --> 30:14.896
Oh.

30:14.979 --> 30:19.150
Yeah. Yeah, and I hope you know that
this has nothing to do with you at all.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.486
It's just she hasn't been divorced
that long and...

30:21.569 --> 30:22.487
Uh-huh.

30:22.570 --> 30:26.324
I just thought she wasn't
thinking things through and...

30:27.367 --> 30:29.702
And that we're rushing
into the whole thing.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.121
-Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
-Right.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.499
But I realized that it's not my place...

30:35.291 --> 30:36.125
at all.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.712
So, you know, I support Joey,
no matter what.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.798
-Right.
-Yeah.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.717
-Well, I will tell her you stopped by.
-Okay.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.969
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

30:46.052 --> 30:46.970
Bye.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.065
Hey, it's me. Uh...

30:59.524 --> 31:01.192
Your sister just stopped by.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.612
Why didn't you tell me
you were fighting about the wedding?

31:10.243 --> 31:13.872
Hey. Just wanted to tell you in person.
Jimmy's taking the deal.

31:14.747 --> 31:15.790
Well, you're welcome.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.127
Yeah, he also gave us a lead
on Calvin's possible location,

31:19.210 --> 31:21.421
a boat called <i>Starkissed.</i>

31:21.504 --> 31:23.423
You ever hear him talk about it?

31:24.173 --> 31:25.717
-No.
-No?

31:28.011 --> 31:28.845
Okay.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.140
So we done here?

31:33.182 --> 31:35.476
I know that Brie's plan
was for you to play possum

31:35.560 --> 31:38.479
while Calvin got the pipeline
back up and running,

31:38.563 --> 31:40.064
but make no mistake.

31:40.148 --> 31:45.069
If any drugs pass through Emerald Lumber
and you're involved,

31:45.153 --> 31:48.323
-you're going straight back to county.
-Relax. Okay?

31:49.198 --> 31:50.617
Brie's smarter than that.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.037
But Brie has a hell of a lot more to lose
than you do.

31:54.120 --> 31:54.954
Okay?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.750
So if you really do love her...

32:00.460 --> 32:01.878
you gotta cut her loose.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.508
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by, huh?

32:10.887 --> 32:12.221
Hey.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.642
Don't you dare cut me loose.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.814
He's right.

32:23.733 --> 32:24.817
Brie, it's...

32:25.318 --> 32:26.986
It's too dangerous.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.196
Brady.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.240
This is my call.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.036
Come here.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.212
So, what's this called again?

32:44.295 --> 32:47.423
Chicken yakisoba.
It's a Japanese stir fry.

32:47.507 --> 32:50.468
-Is it complicated?
-No. Super easy.

32:50.551 --> 32:53.721
My dad taught me how to make it
when I was like 11.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.599
-I never made anything until I moved here.
-Really?

32:56.683 --> 33:00.311
-No one showed you how to cook?
-No, we ordered in a lot or went out.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.815
Well, my parents went out
and I ate cereal in front of the TV.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.733
-That's terrible.
-Not really.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.944
I was obsessed with Captain Crunch.

33:08.695 --> 33:12.699
Well, I hope my yakisoba
can impress your sophisticated palate.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.034
I'm sure I'll love it.

33:17.286 --> 33:21.124
So do you know when Doc and Hope
are coming home?

33:21.708 --> 33:24.085
Uh, Hope said Doc's on a work emergency,

33:24.168 --> 33:26.379
and she's been at the hardware store
for a while.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.714
So I figured I'd prep now

33:27.797 --> 33:30.174
and throw it in the wok
when she gets here.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.428
What do you wanna do
when you're done cooking?

33:35.555 --> 33:36.472
Uh...

33:37.181 --> 33:40.977
Actually, my phone's dead,

33:41.060 --> 33:42.603
and I wanna check in with Hope.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.814
Do you mind grabbing my charger for me?

33:44.897 --> 33:47.650
It's on the desk in the guest room.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.818
Sure.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.558
So, what'd you say to Mel?

34:20.641 --> 34:23.561
That people have the right
to make their own choices.

34:23.644 --> 34:24.604
That's true.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.148
Plus, Joey's the only family she has left.

34:27.231 --> 34:30.151
That's too important
a relationship to risk.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.319
That's a good point.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.113
-I'm very intuitive about these things.
-Mm.

34:34.614 --> 34:38.117
Um, Hope, it's a left here, remember?

34:38.201 --> 34:40.870
-No, it's not.
-I'm pretty sure it is.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.498
Do you know how many times
I've been to Bruce's Hardware?

34:43.581 --> 34:45.374
I can get us there with a blindfold on.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.168
Ooh.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.967
Jo Ellen? Are you okay?

34:55.051 --> 34:58.304
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. How are you?

34:58.387 --> 35:01.432
Please don't tell anybody about this,
especially Vernon.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.393
You weren't really cleared to drive,
were you?

35:07.146 --> 35:08.064
Hope...

35:09.440 --> 35:12.485
You were right. We never would have
made it back to the trailhead before dark.

35:12.568 --> 35:17.031
Yeah, unfortunately, I have a lot
of experience in this area.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.826
These deer stands are just death traps.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.245
So, what's your prognosis?

35:22.328 --> 35:25.331
Well, the good news
is that he's not displaying

35:25.414 --> 35:27.708
vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath,

35:27.792 --> 35:29.752
and his blood pressure is stable.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.796
So we can likely rule out
internal bleeding

35:31.879 --> 35:33.923
-or any severe head injury.
-It appears so.

35:34.006 --> 35:37.009
Now, he is on a low dose
of blood thinners,

35:37.093 --> 35:38.678
so we have to keep a close watch

35:38.761 --> 35:42.682
in case there's any drop in blood pressure
or change in the LOC.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.309
Yeah. Are you sure
we can't get a medevac in here?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.645
No. Trees are too dense.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.064
So I will hike out, get help,

35:50.148 --> 35:53.526
you and Bert take turns
monitoring Charlie's concussion,

35:53.609 --> 35:58.656
and at dawn, me and the rescue EMTs
will hike back in, we'll carry him out.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.951
But are you sure you have
enough daylight to get back safely?

36:02.034 --> 36:03.494
Well, I sure hope so.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.080
Well, you hang in there.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.082
Okay, I got this. Thanks, Doc.

36:20.928 --> 36:21.762
Hey.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.600
Hey.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.437
What's going on? You look happy.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.064
I think I figured out
a second income source.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.609
Okay.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.027
I'm gonna take Airstreams,

36:36.110 --> 36:38.988
I'm gonna put them on my property,
turn it into a glamping site.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.115
I just got a killer deal on my first one.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.992
If I can keep up the momentum,

36:43.075 --> 36:45.912
you and I are gonna be able
to start building a new house

36:45.995 --> 36:47.246
by the end of the year.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.789
Oh, wow.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.708
Oh, that's great.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.419
Really? You don't sound that into it.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.338
I am. I'm-- I am. Sorry.

36:56.672 --> 36:57.506
Okay.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.054
Are you upset about something?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.480
Why are you drinking?

37:13.606 --> 37:15.524
Because I'm stoked about the Airstream.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.695
No. When I came to the bar earlier today,
you were drinking a beer.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.490
Oh, okay.

37:22.573 --> 37:26.786
So, what are we-- We're keeping track now?
Is that what we're doing?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.664
No, I'm not keeping track, okay?

37:29.747 --> 37:31.874
Last night was absolutely awful,

37:31.958 --> 37:33.751
and you swore it wouldn't happen again,

37:33.834 --> 37:36.128
but then I come home and you're drinking.

37:36.212 --> 37:40.841
I honestly didn't think having
one or two drinks was a problem.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.678
You know, I spend every waking moment

37:43.761 --> 37:46.430
worried about what I'm eating,
what I'm drinking,

37:46.514 --> 37:47.974
how I'm working out...

37:48.766 --> 37:50.518
just so that I can protect our baby,

37:50.601 --> 37:53.521
but I feel like you're being
completely careless with yourself.

37:53.604 --> 37:57.108
I'm not being careless. I'm doing
what I need to do to support you, okay?

37:57.191 --> 37:59.819
And Lonergan, Charmaine, the house,

37:59.902 --> 38:02.321
these are my issues. Okay? But--

38:06.033 --> 38:09.203
Well, I hope you're happy.
You got what you wanted.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.164
-What happened?
-You talked to Nate?

38:13.165 --> 38:16.168
-Yeah.
-Thanks to you, he called off the wedding.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.878
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

38:17.962 --> 38:18.921
Oh, Joey.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.173
Joey.
