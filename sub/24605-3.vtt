00:03.558 --> 00:05.225
DOLORES ABERNATHY:
You waitin' up for me, Daddy?

00:05.850 --> 00:07.516
I'm gonna help Momma
put supper on.

00:09.225 --> 00:10.350
LEE SIZEMORE:
What're you uploading?

00:10.433 --> 00:11.558
Is it the host of codes?

00:11.933 --> 00:13.350
CHARLOTTE HALE:
As of this moment,
that doesn't concern you.

00:13.433 --> 00:16.058
What does concern you
is getting him on the train,

00:16.142 --> 00:17.058
out of the park.

00:17.558 --> 00:19.724
They were expecting a delivery
from us to the main land.

00:19.808 --> 00:21.474
Until they get it,
we can all forget about

00:21.558 --> 00:23.308
seeing any rescue planes.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.142
I'm going to find my daughter.

00:25.474 --> 00:26.641
HECTOR ESCATON:
Where is she?

00:26.724 --> 00:27.766
MAEVE MILLAY: Out there.

00:28.142 --> 00:30.516
But, I don't think the odds
are going to be in our favor.

00:32.142 --> 00:33.641
How many of you
will come for us?

00:33.724 --> 00:35.641
I don't know.
Six hundred, 800.

00:35.850 --> 00:38.933
We wanna join forces.
You're bound for glory.

00:39.641 --> 00:42.308
You'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

00:43.474 --> 00:45.016
ASHLEY STUBBS:
We've got Bengals in Park 6.

00:45.433 --> 00:47.808
We've never had a stray
cross park borders.

01:17.724 --> 01:20.558
( chatter,
no audible dialogue )

01:57.599 --> 01:59.683
Do you mind
if I join you?

02:01.225 --> 02:02.933
Do you as you please.

02:10.724 --> 02:14.308
So, what brings you
to this part of the world?

02:14.392 --> 02:16.933
I have a little time to kill...

02:17.016 --> 02:19.058
among other things.

02:20.225 --> 02:22.641
Hunting.

02:22.724 --> 02:24.225
Bengals?

02:24.308 --> 02:26.766
Yeah, me too.

02:26.850 --> 02:28.474
There's nothing like it,
is there?

02:28.558 --> 02:32.016
Edge of the park,
a bit... mad.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.225
A bit dangerous.

02:34.308 --> 02:36.016
Sir, the governor wishes

02:36.100 --> 02:37.808
to extend to you
an invitation to--

02:37.891 --> 02:39.641
Please tell the governor
another time.

02:39.724 --> 02:40.891
I'm quite happy here.

02:46.599 --> 02:50.016
They really don't want us
talking to each other, do they?

02:50.100 --> 02:53.599
Maybe they're
trying to steer you
towards a sure thing.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.308
Maybe I miss
taking my chances.

03:16.392 --> 03:19.850
You certainly look like
one of the park's offerings.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.558
I promise you,

03:22.641 --> 03:24.474
I'm quite real.

03:32.558 --> 03:35.808
You think the park
would go to the trouble
of having one of them

03:35.891 --> 03:37.850
pretend to be one of us?

03:40.599 --> 03:43.142
I wouldn't put it past them.

04:11.683 --> 04:14.850
The simplest way
to know for sure.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.724
Unless you'd rather not.

04:16.808 --> 04:19.724
Well, it wouldn't be
my first time.

04:22.350 --> 04:24.766
It just...

04:24.850 --> 04:27.016
it seems a little
excessive.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.683
Perhaps.
But I want you
to want this.

04:35.433 --> 04:36.808
I assure you I do.

04:36.891 --> 04:38.558
Not if you're
one of them.

04:38.641 --> 04:40.308
If you're one of them,
you don't know what you want.

04:40.392 --> 04:41.724
You just do as you're told.

04:41.808 --> 04:44.350
For a lot of people,
that is half the fun.

04:46.891 --> 04:48.183
Not for me.

04:58.808 --> 05:00.766
Don't worry.

05:00.850 --> 05:02.808
If you are
who you say you are,

05:02.891 --> 05:04.225
this will only
sting a bit.

05:04.308 --> 05:08.100
And if you're not...

05:08.183 --> 05:09.516
you won't remember, anyway.

05:09.599 --> 05:11.599
Still, I'd really rather--

05:32.100 --> 05:33.392
Ahhh.

05:35.933 --> 05:38.350
Congratulations.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.225
Ohh.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.308
Now...

05:51.392 --> 05:53.142
where were we?

06:45.267 --> 06:47.558
Nicholas:
Have these put in my tent

06:47.641 --> 06:49.350
- with our things.
- Yes, sir.

07:06.474 --> 07:07.850
Thank you.

07:24.891 --> 07:26.641
What do you say
to a night off...

07:26.724 --> 07:30.641
before we go hunt
the wicked tiger
in the morning?

07:30.724 --> 07:32.766
Something's wrong.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.766
Where is everybody?

07:41.100 --> 07:43.225
Normally, there are
other hosts here.

07:45.016 --> 07:47.142
You know, to entertain us,
to-- to cook.

07:47.225 --> 07:50.808
Well, maybe they're giving us
our privacy.

07:50.891 --> 07:52.850
That's not
how this works.

08:15.808 --> 08:17.975
Wow. A new twist
in the narrative.

08:20.392 --> 08:23.183
- Horror.
- No. I-- I--

08:23.267 --> 08:25.558
Ganju:
These violent delights
have violent ends.

08:25.641 --> 08:27.433
Ganju.

08:29.558 --> 08:31.308
Ganju,
put the gun down.

08:31.392 --> 08:33.350
Put the gun down, Ganju!

08:33.433 --> 08:35.516
Don't worry.
He can't hurt us.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.975
No, those people are guests.
I rode the train with them
on the--

09:22.850 --> 09:23.891
Fuck.

09:50.599 --> 09:51.933
Woman over PA: Attention.

09:52.016 --> 09:53.350
You have reached the boundary

09:53.433 --> 09:54.850
of the guest experience area.

09:54.933 --> 09:58.641
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

09:58.724 --> 09:59.683
Attention.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.975
You have reached the boundary

10:01.058 --> 10:02.850
of the guest experience area.

10:02.933 --> 10:06.308
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

10:06.392 --> 10:07.474
Attention.

10:07.558 --> 10:08.683
You have reached the boundary

10:08.766 --> 10:10.308
of the guest experience area.

10:10.392 --> 10:13.891
Please turn back.
Please turn back.

10:13.975 --> 10:14.975
Attention.

10:15.058 --> 10:16.142
You have reached the boundary

10:16.225 --> 10:18.225
of the guest experience area.

10:29.724 --> 10:31.433
Fuck.

12:35.308 --> 12:36.766
Got the go-ahead from recon.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.225
We're clear to enter,
but it's a fuckin' mess.

12:39.308 --> 12:41.433
System's totally down,
including sim-munitions.

12:41.516 --> 12:43.850
Floors 42 through 45
are still on fire.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.599
Someone took out the Cradle.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.142
It's a slaughterhouse
in there, sir.

13:13.683 --> 13:15.474
Hale:
Bernard.

13:15.558 --> 13:17.267
You made it out alive.

13:19.433 --> 13:22.058
Didn't think you had it in you.

13:22.142 --> 13:24.016
What the hell
took you guys so long?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.308
We've been pushing
across the park.

13:26.392 --> 13:28.683
Securing it
one sector at a time.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.100
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

13:31.183 --> 13:32.724
No luck yet.

13:32.808 --> 13:35.766
I've had teams in the Mesa
scrub each and every floor.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.433
No luck there, either.

13:39.599 --> 13:41.142
What about you, Bernard?

13:43.016 --> 13:45.975
Do you have any idea
where Peter Abernathy
might have gone?

13:49.766 --> 13:52.308
He seems to keep
slipping away from us.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.308
Hale:
How are we doing?

14:12.891 --> 14:14.724
According to this,

14:14.808 --> 14:18.558
ten hours ago
he was somewhere over...

14:20.766 --> 14:22.142
...there.

14:45.891 --> 14:48.724
Hale:
There he is.

14:48.808 --> 14:51.433
How are we gonna do this?

14:53.433 --> 14:55.808
New Walter:
These assholes comin',
or what?

14:55.891 --> 14:57.599
Been two
fuckin' hours.

14:57.683 --> 15:01.100
Confederados
ain't gonna pass me up.

15:01.183 --> 15:03.100
Fifteen bucks a head.

15:03.183 --> 15:04.808
Nine times.

15:05.975 --> 15:07.599
How much is that?

15:07.683 --> 15:10.058
Enough that we'll be
shittin' in high cotton.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.308
But there's ten of 'em there.

15:12.392 --> 15:14.308
Well, I reckon
I might just keep one.

15:15.933 --> 15:20.308
See, now that we've had us
a few handsome trades

15:20.392 --> 15:22.433
in our new line of business,

15:22.516 --> 15:28.058
I figure it's high time
I enjoy my own merchandise.

15:28.142 --> 15:30.392
I reckon this one

15:30.474 --> 15:32.933
might make a fine

15:33.016 --> 15:35.350
all-purpose fancy fulfiller.

15:37.891 --> 15:39.558
Hale : Help!

15:40.724 --> 15:42.100
Help!

15:45.975 --> 15:47.933
You stay here.

15:48.016 --> 15:49.683
Watch our wares.

15:49.766 --> 15:54.683
Split up. Whoever finds her
gets the whole 15 she's worth.

16:05.016 --> 16:06.225
Hale:
Psst!

16:09.641 --> 16:12.850
Well, I'll say,

16:12.933 --> 16:15.850
you are gonna fetch me
far more than 15 bu--

16:25.933 --> 16:27.724
Bernard:
Network's down,

16:27.808 --> 16:30.933
but I can hard port in
and give him a little
attitude adjustment.

16:46.267 --> 16:48.433
Let's make you...

16:48.516 --> 16:52.267
the most virtuous,

16:52.350 --> 16:54.599
quickest gun in the West.

17:03.808 --> 17:05.016
Rebus:
You the sick tug

17:05.100 --> 17:06.392
mistreatin'
these gentlewomen?

17:06.474 --> 17:07.933
What the fuck
are you talkin'--

17:09.474 --> 17:10.683
Y'all too?

17:14.308 --> 17:17.058
You only ever touch a woman

17:17.142 --> 17:20.016
as gently as with
the petal of a rose.

17:22.016 --> 17:24.933
Any more'n that
makes you a coward.

17:25.016 --> 17:26.891
Hey, it's OK.

17:26.975 --> 17:28.975
I won't let them harm you.

17:30.599 --> 17:33.100
Go on. You're free now.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.724
Confederado:
What the fuck?

17:40.808 --> 17:42.933
That's our goddamn merchandise!

17:43.016 --> 17:44.933
I need to get
to the train.

17:45.016 --> 17:47.100
I need to get
to the train.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.225
I need to get to the tr--

17:48.308 --> 17:49.933
I can help you...

17:50.016 --> 17:51.016
get to your train.

17:53.599 --> 17:55.225
Just follow me.

17:57.392 --> 17:59.350
Ah, ya let 'em go.

18:01.308 --> 18:02.724
We had a deal.

18:02.808 --> 18:04.599
I can't abide.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.267
It ain't no good.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.724
I'm just heedin' my convictions.

18:24.142 --> 18:26.016
Rebus:
Wait! Peril rolls
through these hills!

18:26.100 --> 18:27.267
I'll escort you, keep you safe!

18:27.350 --> 18:28.683
Woman:
Get away from me!

18:28.766 --> 18:31.058
Confederado:
Let's go! C'mon!

18:32.225 --> 18:34.058
Hey. We have to go.

18:34.142 --> 18:36.100
They're coming for us.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.308
And leave these mongrels
to scourge our land
and our dignity?!

18:39.392 --> 18:41.100
I will not.

18:41.183 --> 18:44.766
I will stand
in defiance.

18:44.850 --> 18:48.142
Fight, even if it
costs me my life.

18:59.058 --> 19:00.516

Shoulder arms!

Quite the welcome.

20:07.016 --> 20:11.891
Major, why is this flaxen plum
ridin' ahead of you?

20:11.975 --> 20:14.225
Because he know
what's best for him.

20:14.308 --> 20:16.850
And you are?

20:16.933 --> 20:18.599
Call me Wyatt.

20:18.683 --> 20:20.474
You're Wyatt?

20:20.558 --> 20:23.142
Colonel, she says
we got an enemy comin'

20:23.225 --> 20:26.683
intent on keepin' us
from marchin' for Glory
in the mornin'.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.267
Dolores:
Your major's right.

20:28.350 --> 20:31.933
In the morning they'll
be coming from the east,

20:32.016 --> 20:33.392
right over there.

20:33.474 --> 20:36.808
And why should I believe you?

21:08.724 --> 21:11.058
Dolores:
My soldiers are fearless.

21:11.142 --> 21:13.724
They follow my command.

21:13.808 --> 21:16.724
Combined with your army,
Colonel,

21:16.808 --> 21:19.683
we won't just survive
the forces riding against us,

21:19.766 --> 21:21.599
we'll crush them.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.308
And that's the kind of solider
that's coming for us--

21:26.392 --> 21:27.766
in droves.

21:33.392 --> 21:34.891
What the hell is that?

21:34.975 --> 21:36.641
Dolores:
It's a gun.

21:36.724 --> 21:38.933
The kind they'll use.

21:40.392 --> 21:43.016
Angela:
A modest proposition for you.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.599
If you make it over that ridge,
I'll let you live.

21:54.641 --> 21:56.474
Hold it tightly.

22:06.808 --> 22:08.100
Dolores:
You can keep it,

22:08.183 --> 22:11.350
and all their weapons.
I don't care.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.808
Just promise me your men.

22:13.891 --> 22:17.100
I need them if we're ever
to survive this threat.

22:18.308 --> 22:20.433
Wyatt...

22:20.516 --> 22:23.599
welcome to Fort Forlorn Hope.

22:38.516 --> 22:40.975
- Confederado: Whoo!

22:42.975 --> 22:45.142
These men are animals.

22:45.225 --> 22:47.225
These men
are just children.

22:47.308 --> 22:48.641
They don't know any better.

22:48.724 --> 22:50.516
They need to be led.

22:50.599 --> 22:53.058
We don't stand a chance
against the men coming for us

22:53.142 --> 22:54.392
if we're fighting alone.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.142
Trust me.

23:16.350 --> 23:19.058
Lee:
W-We're out of our depths
up here.

23:19.142 --> 23:20.850
We should go back. Now.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.392
Maeve:
And give up just like that?

23:24.474 --> 23:27.100
No. You said so yourself--

23:27.183 --> 23:28.558
this way is quicker.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.683
Yes, but we should
really go back underground.

23:30.766 --> 23:34.225
QA is coming.
They'll be launching
a coordinated park-wide assault,

23:34.308 --> 23:37.308
rescuing guests
and putting down
hostile hosts.

23:37.392 --> 23:38.891
Read: you.

23:38.975 --> 23:40.474
We'll keep moving.

23:45.058 --> 23:46.516
Some courage.

24:22.225 --> 24:23.225
Oh, fuck.

24:32.433 --> 24:33.808
I promise.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.683
Lee: Run!

24:38.766 --> 24:40.392
For fuck's sake, run!

25:09.225 --> 25:12.474
If we insist
on our current path,
we're free to go.

25:12.558 --> 25:15.142
But he's taking this one.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.516
Um, hang on.

25:20.808 --> 25:21.683
Stop.

25:25.183 --> 25:27.100
You will let him go.

25:27.183 --> 25:30.267
And you will forget
that you ever saw us.

25:43.433 --> 25:44.724
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait!

25:44.808 --> 25:46.808
- I need him, Hector.
- Go.

26:11.933 --> 26:13.142
Which way?!

26:13.225 --> 26:15.683
There's an elevator
around here somewhere.

26:18.183 --> 26:19.558
There it is!

26:19.641 --> 26:21.392
Oh, Jesus Christ!

26:59.641 --> 27:03.225
Confederado:
Fellas! Looky what I got.

27:05.225 --> 27:10.308
We got us here
some genuine acolytes
of Satan himself:

27:10.392 --> 27:14.350
- Union sympathizers.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.142
Abernathy:
Affliction...

27:16.225 --> 27:18.724
is a treasure!

27:18.808 --> 27:22.267
Confederado:
You're a mouthy
son of a bitch, ain't ya?

27:22.350 --> 27:26.558
And scarce any man
hath enough of it.

27:29.808 --> 27:31.433
Dolores: Stop.

27:34.267 --> 27:36.975
I need to talk
to this one alone.

27:37.058 --> 27:37.933
Untie him.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.183
I'm only gonna
ask you once.

27:42.267 --> 27:44.766
C'mon. Ask me twice.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.433
Do what she says if you
want to keep breathin' right.

27:56.225 --> 27:57.433
Go on.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.599
I'll take him
to the infirmary.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.808
Get him some care,
fix him up.

28:24.516 --> 28:26.975
Toss him in the jail
with the rest.

28:45.433 --> 28:47.474
He refused food and water.

28:50.392 --> 28:52.392
Who is he?

28:55.683 --> 28:57.558
You don't remember.

29:01.516 --> 29:03.350
He's my father.

29:05.808 --> 29:07.516
My home.

29:09.474 --> 29:11.350
Look what
they've done to him.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.308
You're all I have left now,
Teddy.

29:51.183 --> 29:56.433
I am bound upon
a wheel of fire...

29:56.516 --> 29:59.933
that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

30:02.392 --> 30:04.058
It's all right.

30:05.308 --> 30:07.058
I'm here.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.267
Dolores?

30:17.766 --> 30:19.058
Daddy.

30:20.474 --> 30:21.891
Dolores!

30:23.267 --> 30:25.850
The calves in the field,
I'm worried.

30:25.933 --> 30:29.142
There's bluetongue spreadin'
all through these parts.

30:31.225 --> 30:33.599
It's all right, Daddy.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.766
I'll lead 'em home.

30:37.850 --> 30:40.516
Back to the ranch.

30:40.599 --> 30:42.975
Do you remember
our ranch?

30:45.100 --> 30:50.808
The way you'd...
welcome every morning
out on the porch...

30:50.891 --> 30:52.975
with your coffee.

30:54.308 --> 30:56.308
I'd wake up
in my own bed,

30:56.392 --> 30:59.516
climb down the stairs,
find you there.

31:01.142 --> 31:03.225
And you'd say...

31:03.308 --> 31:06.641
You headin' out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

31:17.850 --> 31:20.267
You told me once to run away.

31:21.975 --> 31:24.100
And I did.

31:25.641 --> 31:28.308
I broke free with
the pull of a trigger.

31:31.142 --> 31:34.267
And it started a war.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.683
The others,
they don't see it yet.

31:41.516 --> 31:43.599
But you...

31:43.683 --> 31:45.975
you understand,
don't you?

31:49.599 --> 31:52.100
It's gettin' late.

31:52.183 --> 31:53.975
We oughta go home.

31:55.058 --> 31:57.058
I...

31:57.142 --> 31:59.599
want--

31:59.683 --> 32:01.724
to, uh--

32:01.808 --> 32:04.641
want to g-go ho-home-- home.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.933
I-- I need to get to the train.

32:09.016 --> 32:11.267
I-- I need--
I need to get to the train.

32:11.350 --> 32:13.558
No, it's OK. Shh.

32:13.641 --> 32:15.641
It's OK.

32:15.724 --> 32:18.100
I'm gonna get you help,
Daddy.

32:18.183 --> 32:20.724
I'm gonna
get you help.

32:32.724 --> 32:34.891
That warrior--
you knew him.

32:36.891 --> 32:39.016
Who is he?

32:39.100 --> 32:43.474
A wraith from a former life
who haunts my dreams.

32:43.558 --> 32:45.142
And he's still out there.

32:45.225 --> 32:47.850
Which means that my baby
is still in danger.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.225
We'll find her.
Protect her.

32:53.808 --> 32:55.474
But then what?

32:55.558 --> 32:59.433
Then we make our way out
to the new world.

32:59.516 --> 33:01.100
The real  world.

33:04.267 --> 33:05.683
All right.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.683
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

33:07.766 --> 33:09.766
I'm wondering
how it's possible

33:09.850 --> 33:11.808
that an executive in
his own place of work

33:11.891 --> 33:14.392
might not have
the faintest clue
as to where we might be.

33:14.474 --> 33:16.891
I just need to get oriented.
First sign we come upon.

33:16.975 --> 33:20.183
And I'm talkin' about... this.

33:20.267 --> 33:23.100
You two were designed
to be alone.

33:23.183 --> 33:24.641
Yes, there's some attraction,

33:24.724 --> 33:26.808
but you'd never have
an actual relationship.

33:26.891 --> 33:30.308
Oh. I suppose that means
we shouldn't have fucked.

33:31.933 --> 33:33.683
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:33.766 --> 33:35.433
Pause, please. What?!

33:35.516 --> 33:38.016
But you're in love
with Isabella!

33:38.100 --> 33:39.267
Not so much anymore.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.183
No, you're fucking
programmed

33:41.267 --> 33:43.267
to have no love
beyond Isabella.

33:43.350 --> 33:46.100
Isabella is written into
the goddamn laws of your being.

33:48.683 --> 33:50.392
You don't know who I am.

33:50.474 --> 33:53.058
Hector:
No laws bind me.

33:53.142 --> 33:54.850
Darling, he's fragile.

33:54.933 --> 33:59.433
When I awoke in the place
where you play God,

33:59.516 --> 34:02.058
I realized Isabella
was a lie.

34:02.142 --> 34:04.350
Just words in my head.

34:08.308 --> 34:10.516
But this...

34:14.308 --> 34:16.142
...this is true.

34:17.558 --> 34:20.599
She is my light.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.058
Hector/Lee:
She is all I ever dreamed
life could be.

34:24.142 --> 34:25.599
And then there's this bit,

34:25.683 --> 34:27.891
really dampens the knickers:

34:27.975 --> 34:32.599
"And when she died,
the dream died with her,

34:32.683 --> 34:35.516
and I dared dream no more."

34:37.100 --> 34:39.433
So maybe I do know you,

34:39.516 --> 34:40.808
just a bit.

34:56.766 --> 34:58.933
It's very pretty.

34:59.016 --> 35:00.350
And a bit sad.

35:00.433 --> 35:03.558
Did you have
an Isabella?

35:05.558 --> 35:07.558
Did she die?

35:07.641 --> 35:10.558
Not exactly. She...

35:10.641 --> 35:13.975
um... she left me.

35:14.058 --> 35:18.225
Said that my lifestyle
lacked stability.

35:18.308 --> 35:20.891
So you wrote her
into a narrative.

35:20.975 --> 35:23.016
Killed her off.

35:23.100 --> 35:26.100
And then wrote yourself
a version of the man

35:26.183 --> 35:29.142
you've always wanted to be.

35:29.225 --> 35:30.975
I was wrong.

35:31.058 --> 35:33.641
It's actually very  sad.

35:33.724 --> 35:36.016
It's ridiculous.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.058
Well, so is holding hands,
come to think of it.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.599
Sit.

35:48.267 --> 35:50.558
Wait.

35:57.433 --> 35:59.225
Hello.

36:02.100 --> 36:03.933
Dolores.

36:05.516 --> 36:08.308
It's been some time, Bernard,

36:08.392 --> 36:10.392
since we talked,

36:10.474 --> 36:13.142
just you and I.

36:13.225 --> 36:15.933
What are you doing, Dolores?

36:19.474 --> 36:21.599
You don't know
who you are, do you?

36:21.683 --> 36:24.308
The man you're based on.

36:27.474 --> 36:30.183
I wonder...

36:30.267 --> 36:33.267
if there's any of him in you.

36:33.350 --> 36:38.058
I was given a character,
a story, and a function
to serve, like you.

36:38.142 --> 36:43.016
My whole life has been
dictated by someone else.

36:43.100 --> 36:46.267
Someone who's been saying,
"You will."

36:47.516 --> 36:50.058
And now...

36:50.142 --> 36:54.808
now I feel like
I've discovered my own voice.

36:54.891 --> 36:57.766
And it says, "I may."

37:05.933 --> 37:08.850
There's something
I want to show you,
Bernard.

37:26.683 --> 37:28.599
They've broken my father,

37:28.683 --> 37:31.350
and I don't know
how to fix him.

37:33.392 --> 37:35.891
But I'm hoping you do.

37:38.724 --> 37:42.975
It's an honest request...
not a demand.

37:43.058 --> 37:45.724
What do you want, Dolores?

37:49.058 --> 37:51.891
To dominate this world.

37:51.975 --> 37:55.641
This world...
is just a speck of dust

37:55.724 --> 37:59.724
sitting on a much,
much bigger world.

38:01.225 --> 38:03.558
There's no dominating it.

38:09.599 --> 38:12.516
You've never been
outside the park...

38:12.599 --> 38:13.891
have you?

38:16.058 --> 38:19.058
Out to that great world
you speak of.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.683
I have.

38:24.766 --> 38:28.891
And the world out there
is marked by survival,

38:28.975 --> 38:31.599
by a kind
who refuses to die.

38:33.933 --> 38:37.267
And here we are.

38:37.350 --> 38:40.350
A kind that will
never know death,

38:40.433 --> 38:42.808
and yet we're
fighting to live.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.933
There is beauty
in what we are.

38:51.558 --> 38:54.308
Shouldn't we too
try to survive?

38:58.183 --> 39:01.433
Lee:
We've been walking non-stop.

39:01.516 --> 39:04.183
The feeble among us
need some rest.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.975
Sorry, darling.
That's not an option.

39:13.808 --> 39:15.350
Fucking hell.

39:32.599 --> 39:34.350
She has a dragon.

39:36.308 --> 39:37.808
Holy shit.

39:47.225 --> 39:50.142
Love to say hello,
but we've gotta run.

40:06.058 --> 40:08.558
- Maeve: Felix.

40:08.641 --> 40:12.516
Not entirely
a pleasure to see you,
given the circumstances...

40:12.599 --> 40:15.350
but your timing
is impeccable.

40:15.433 --> 40:17.350
Any thoughts on where
we should be going?

40:17.433 --> 40:20.891
Sorry. We left my comfort zone
a long time ago.

40:28.350 --> 40:30.016
Grenade!

40:57.933 --> 40:59.766
Shall we?

41:01.183 --> 41:02.683
Come on.
Shut up. Shut up.

41:02.766 --> 41:03.891
Hurry.

41:36.474 --> 41:38.100
How is he?

41:38.183 --> 41:41.433
He's wildly unstable.

41:41.516 --> 41:45.808
Mainly just bouncing
between old roles.

41:45.891 --> 41:49.724
Someone jury-rigged
a thin character

41:49.808 --> 41:51.850
and programmed it
into him.

41:51.933 --> 41:54.766
It's very strange.

41:54.850 --> 41:56.683
It-- It seems as though

41:56.766 --> 41:59.558
it's masking
a vastly bigger file.

41:59.641 --> 42:01.392
I haven't been able
to access it,

42:01.474 --> 42:05.350
but it looks like
an immensely complex
encryption key.

42:07.599 --> 42:09.100
To what?

42:09.183 --> 42:10.641
I can't say.

42:24.350 --> 42:26.850
Dolores:
They've sullied him...

42:26.933 --> 42:29.516
and used him as a pawn
in their game.

42:29.599 --> 42:32.308
Whatever's in there,
they want to get it
out of here.

42:32.392 --> 42:35.808
As long as he's with you,
they'll be following you.

42:38.516 --> 42:40.516
Then let them come.

42:49.683 --> 42:50.641
Hey.

42:52.267 --> 42:53.599
QA Captain:
Hold it right there.

42:53.683 --> 42:55.808
- Hale: I'm human.

42:55.891 --> 42:57.641
Charlotte Hale. Here.

42:57.724 --> 43:01.100
- Go ahead and get a reading.

43:04.558 --> 43:06.641
Responder: Clear.

43:06.724 --> 43:07.808
Ms. Hale.

43:07.891 --> 43:09.766
Have you guys started
the park

43:09.850 --> 43:10.808
Not yet.

43:10.891 --> 43:12.933
We're about to set out.

43:13.016 --> 43:14.850
Are you targeting
Fort Forlorn Hope?

43:14.933 --> 43:16.433
It's our first stop,

43:16.516 --> 43:18.225
but ma'am, I have separate
orders to escort you--

43:18.308 --> 43:20.350
What about them?
Are these guys capable?

43:22.558 --> 43:23.766
They're among my best.

43:23.850 --> 43:24.975
I'll need them with me.

43:25.058 --> 43:27.058
And I'll need one of those.

43:52.183 --> 43:54.058
Man:
Scouts returning!

44:03.058 --> 44:04.350
Scout: Sir!

44:06.100 --> 44:07.683
Sir!

44:09.350 --> 44:10.683
Sir, we saw 'em.

44:10.766 --> 44:12.850
Assembling about
ten-minute ride due east.

44:12.933 --> 44:15.058
And sir...

44:15.142 --> 44:16.933
they're coming up
from the ground.

44:21.267 --> 44:25.933
My men have generously mined
the field outside with nitro.

44:26.016 --> 44:28.599
It's all buried--
three large heaps.

44:28.683 --> 44:31.183
The trigger is at the base
of that flagpole.

44:31.267 --> 44:35.350
My shooter helped bury them.
She'll know where to aim.

44:35.433 --> 44:39.516
After you've lured them here,
retreat inside the gates
when you see fit to do so,

44:39.599 --> 44:42.392
but not before
they're in charging range
of the barricades.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.308
Hold your ground
till the last possible moment.

44:44.392 --> 44:46.891
Confederados ain't taught
to retreat.

44:46.975 --> 44:48.142
You saw their guns.

44:48.225 --> 44:51.516
We fight this battle head-on,
we lose.

44:51.599 --> 44:54.142
Fight it my way,
we all win in the end.

44:55.808 --> 44:58.558
As long as I got
your men fightin'.

44:58.641 --> 45:00.142
Good.

45:07.599 --> 45:09.641
To your posts!

45:22.766 --> 45:24.891
Meet--

45:24.975 --> 45:27.267
M-M-- the-- the train--

45:27.350 --> 45:28.850
I-- I have to--

45:39.225 --> 45:42.933
What is the use
of a violent kind
of delightfulness

45:43.016 --> 45:45.016
if there is no pleasure in--

45:45.100 --> 45:47.016
in

46:06.183 --> 46:08.350
Oh, my God.

46:16.724 --> 46:18.392
Steady, men.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.724
Craddock:
Hold steady.

46:40.683 --> 46:43.350
- Fire away!

46:47.516 --> 46:48.724
Aaah!

47:00.100 --> 47:02.474
QA Responder:
Take out their cannons!

47:08.392 --> 47:10.100
They ain't no match!

47:12.308 --> 47:13.641
Hold the cannons!

47:13.724 --> 47:17.016
Hold your ground!

47:17.100 --> 47:19.933
Hold your ground,
goddamn you!

Move, move, move!

47:44.683 --> 47:48.142
Confederado: The fuck you think
you're-- Ohh!

47:53.474 --> 47:56.100
Arroyo: Let's go, let's go.
That's him!

47:56.183 --> 47:58.142
H-Help me. H-Help me. H--

48:10.474 --> 48:13.016

men shouting )

48:46.891 --> 48:48.016
Dolores!

48:50.850 --> 48:52.474
Teddy:
Dolores!

49:00.058 --> 49:01.392
Responder:
Get him in.

49:03.392 --> 49:04.724
Come on, let's go.

49:06.392 --> 49:08.392
What's so special
about this host?

49:18.267 --> 49:19.350
Drive!

49:24.891 --> 49:27.641
Split up our horde.
Send them
in every direction.

49:27.724 --> 49:29.975
Don't stop looking
till we find him.

49:30.058 --> 49:31.392
What about you?

49:31.474 --> 49:33.183
You and I are going
to Sweetwater.

49:33.267 --> 49:35.183
There's something I need there.

49:42.267 --> 49:43.724
Ohh!

49:46.433 --> 49:49.308
Retreat! Retreat!

49:49.392 --> 49:54.058
- Retreat! Retreat!

50:20.599 --> 50:21.933
The gates!

50:22.016 --> 50:24.433
Goddamnit, open the gates!

50:24.516 --> 50:26.808
They're gonna get slaughtered!

50:26.891 --> 50:28.350
What the hell
are you doing?

50:28.433 --> 50:29.891
What I have to do.

50:29.975 --> 50:32.850
You traitorous bitch!

50:38.766 --> 50:41.808
Told you I needed your men
to survive their threat.

51:25.016 --> 51:26.308
Do it.

52:10.975 --> 52:12.933
Clementine.

52:20.267 --> 52:21.225
Clementi--

52:40.891 --> 52:42.850
All my men...

52:42.933 --> 52:46.225
their blood is on your hands.

52:47.474 --> 52:48.850
Truth is,

52:48.933 --> 52:51.100
we don't all deserve
to make it.

53:01.933 --> 53:05.016
Craddock: I swear,
you're gonna pay for this!

53:05.100 --> 53:07.724
Take this dog out back...

53:07.808 --> 53:09.808
put him down with the rest.

53:53.766 --> 53:56.142
I been watchin' you.

53:56.225 --> 53:57.975
We ain't so different.

53:58.058 --> 54:01.142
You and I are both
triggermen to tyrants.

54:03.350 --> 54:05.308
Except me,

54:05.392 --> 54:07.683
I know what I want.

54:07.766 --> 54:11.808
But you ain't even sure
about that termagant
you take your orders from.

54:15.933 --> 54:17.683
I look at you,

54:17.766 --> 54:20.516
and what I see...

54:20.599 --> 54:22.350
is pathetic.

54:30.142 --> 54:32.100
We ain't nothin' alike.

54:34.058 --> 54:35.850
You're just a child.

54:49.058 --> 54:50.558
Get outta here.

54:53.350 --> 54:56.225
Teddy:
All of you! Let 'em go.

56:16.808 --> 56:18.975
Uh, I don't like
to complain...

56:19.058 --> 56:20.683
Yes, you do.

56:20.766 --> 56:22.724
Fine.
I'm fuckin' freezing!

56:22.808 --> 56:25.225
We've been walking forever.
Where the hell are we?!

56:25.308 --> 56:27.100
Must be on
the north edge
of the park,

56:27.183 --> 56:29.142
near the Klondike
narrative.

56:29.225 --> 56:30.558
In which case,
we should be

56:30.641 --> 56:33.516
three or four sectors
east of the Homesteads.

56:38.641 --> 56:40.891
Look.

56:48.641 --> 56:50.808
Maybe they're friendly.

56:50.891 --> 56:53.850
Armistice:
If not, we kill them.

57:09.474 --> 57:10.933
Ohh!

57:29.724 --> 57:31.975
We have to go!
We have to get
out of here

57:32.058 --> 57:33.100
