( man on loudspeaker )
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain has illuminated

00:43.811 --> 00:45.613
our seat belt sign

00:45.679 --> 00:49.250
indicating our descent to
Miami International Airport.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.719
Please put your tray tables
and your seat backs

00:51.785 --> 00:53.154
in the upright position.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.788
We'll be landing
in Miami soon.

01:28.789 --> 01:29.823
Hi, I'm checking in.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.628
( keys clanking )

01:39.400 --> 01:43.171
I know it's not popular to say,
but I hate balloons.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.583
( woman giggling )

02:00.721 --> 02:02.590
This is bullshit.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.264
Jesus.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.131
I'm sorry, bro,
I didn't see you there.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.600
I'm sorry.

03:05.185 --> 03:09.357
( waves crashing )

03:22.270 --> 03:25.439
( waves crashing )

03:45.926 --> 03:47.561
Hey!

03:50.431 --> 03:52.566
Hey, that's my--
Don't take my chair!

03:57.405 --> 03:58.939
That's my stuff!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.610
Hey!

04:05.178 --> 04:06.947
That's my stuff!

04:11.151 --> 04:11.885
( Louie )
Hey!

04:18.759 --> 04:19.893
Hey!

04:27.368 --> 04:28.035
Buddy, I'm not drown...

04:29.670 --> 04:31.038
I'm not drowning!
Relax.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.706
I'm not drowning!

04:32.773 --> 04:34.708
That guy was taking
my stuff, I'm not--
Relax, relax.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.378
I'm not drowning!

04:37.445 --> 04:38.812
I'm not drowning,
I'm telling you!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.519
I got you, I got you,
I got you!

04:47.821 --> 04:50.758
( coughing )

04:50.824 --> 04:51.959
( man )
Is he all right?
( man )
Is he okay?

04:52.025 --> 04:54.261
Hey, come on, bro.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.763
( coughing )

04:55.829 --> 04:57.631
You all right, bro?

04:57.698 --> 04:59.400
Yeah.
Don't be
embarrassed, man.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.869
Anyone can lose control
in the water.
Okay.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.404
You okay?
Uh-huh.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.973
God!
I'll stay here
with you for a bit.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.841
Okay.
I'm Ramon.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.879
I'm Louie.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.547
You on vacation?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.015
What?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.016
You on vacation, you--

05:16.083 --> 05:17.718
No, I...

05:17.785 --> 05:18.852
( coughing )

05:18.919 --> 05:20.354
I'm a comedian, I--

05:20.421 --> 05:22.790
I'm working at the hotel,
I'm doing shows.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.358
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard
there was a comedian

05:24.425 --> 05:25.926
in the lounge, man.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.061
I'm might have to
come check you out.
Okay.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.230
You know, it's good to laugh,
you know, it's like--

05:30.297 --> 05:32.433
it's like a gift you
give people, you know?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.834
You funny?
Are you funny?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.369
Yeah.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.404
Well, then I did a good
thing by saving you.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.905
( coughing )

05:37.971 --> 05:40.107
Yeah, but you know, I...

05:40.173 --> 05:41.742
I wasn't drowning.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.477
I, uh...
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.212
Yeah, you weren't
drowning.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.414
Totally, man, I got you.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.889
( groaning )

06:03.397 --> 06:05.065
Anyway, thank you
very much.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.667
Good night, thank you.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.736
( audience applauding )

06:10.571 --> 06:12.039
Hey.
( Ramon )
Hey, man.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.173
Hey, Ramon.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.341
Hey, I'm glad
you came, man.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.544
Hey, man, you were
so funny, like--

06:16.610 --> 06:19.680
So funny, I was
laughing so hard, man.
Oh, thanks, man.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.149
Can I buy you a drink
for saving my life?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.851
I'll have Sprite.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.253
Can I get a thing--

06:26.319 --> 06:28.355
Brown shot?
Thanks, man.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.291
So, um...
You from Miami?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.026
Well, I was born in Cuba.
Really?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.228
Yeah, then I came here
when I was a baby.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.464
That's a big move
for a little baby.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.632
( laughing )

06:38.699 --> 06:41.101
I mean my parents brought me
here when I was a baby.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.836
Like on a raft
or something?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.439
Or something.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.774
I'm sorry, man.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.676
I-- I know nothing.
No worries, man.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.810
No, that was stupid.
No, no, no.

06:49.877 --> 06:52.680
My Uncle Chavo
used to say,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.749
"Dice no se,
entonces aprendes todo."

06:55.816 --> 06:57.084
It means--

06:57.150 --> 06:59.520
Say you don't know
and then you learn everything.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.054
Â¿ Hablas espaÃ±ol?
Well, not really.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.457
I forgot a lot of it,
but we lived in Mexico

07:03.524 --> 07:04.525
when I was a kid.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.026
My dad's Mexican.
No shit.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.128
No shit at all.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.863
My mom's American, but we
came here when I was seven,

07:09.930 --> 07:10.798
just like you.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.500
Well, all right, hermano.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.768
( laughing )

07:18.706 --> 07:20.340
Can I have
one of these?

07:20.407 --> 07:21.675
Thanks.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.211
Uh, no, you can't.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.713
What?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.148
No, you can't have
one of my strawberries.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.150
But I already ate it.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.785
I know, that's what--

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
You asked me if you could
have one and I said no,

07:33.921 --> 07:37.525
so you just ate a strawberry
that you can't have.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.566
Hey.
Hey.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.100
What are you doing?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.736
This.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.305
I'm going to a big party
with good music, good food,

07:52.372 --> 07:54.842
Cuban style.
Pechuga a la parilla.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.444
It's gonna be
a good time.
Great.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.512
So come on, let's go.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.848
What, me?
You.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.415
No, man,
I don't want to--

08:02.482 --> 08:04.918
You don't want to what?
Have a good time?

08:04.985 --> 08:08.756
Come on, man, I'm gonna show
you Miami, like, for real.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.025
You're really
inviting me?
I'm inviting you.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.493
Okay.
Yeah?

08:13.561 --> 08:15.362
Yeah, all right.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.630
Let's go.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.898
Now?
Like right now.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.099
Okay, all right.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.875
( Ramon )
Louie.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.409
Louie, Â¿ cÃ³mo estÃ¡?

09:36.476 --> 09:38.045
Hey, Santiago.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.351

09:44.417 --> 09:46.186
Hi. Hello.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.889

09:48.956 --> 09:51.324
( Ramon )
Mama, Mama.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.660
Louie... Louie!

09:54.294 --> 09:56.496
Ay, quÃ© sudado estÃ¡

09:56.563 --> 09:59.299
Oyeme,Â¿ vas a comer

09:59.366 --> 10:02.302
Mofongo, platanitos, lechÃ³n.

10:02.369 --> 10:02.836
Â¿ Algo de tomar, mira?

10:02.903 --> 10:05.472
Dale, dale comida.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.774
Te voy a presentarte

10:06.840 --> 10:08.075
Se llama Louie.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.376
Si.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.744
Louie.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.047
Un amigo es un hermano

10:14.114 --> 10:16.016
y un hermano
es un amigo.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.951
Me entiende?
Si, yes.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.053
( laughing )

10:20.120 --> 10:21.188
Lo vemos.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.256
Thank you, thank you.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.100
Vamos, pues!

10:45.345 --> 10:47.114
Hola.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.416
( laughs )

10:53.220 --> 10:54.855
I see what you're doing.
Hey, Ramon.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.190
I got no moves.
How you liking it,
hermano ?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.525
Oh, it's-- it's great.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.060
I mean, you took me
here and let me

11:00.127 --> 11:02.095
meet your
whole family, man.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.397
Thank you, I appreciate it.
Of course, man,
it's my pleasure.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.834
How you liking
the real Miami?
Oh, it's amazing, man.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.869
I never-- in fact,

11:08.936 --> 11:10.237
I've been coming to Miami
for 20 years, I never saw it.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.304
Not like this.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.677
It's kind of like
those people up there.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.912
Some of them been living
there their whole lives

11:18.979 --> 11:21.982
and they've never seen
where they live.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.151
And you look up and then
you see 'em on their balconies

11:24.217 --> 11:26.754
and they're alone.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.588
And you kind of feel
sorry for 'em

11:28.655 --> 11:33.093
because they're alone,
you know?
Yeah, I know, I know.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.328
Anyways, man, how--
Where'd you--

11:35.395 --> 11:37.364
Where did you get the balls
to be a comedian?

11:37.430 --> 11:39.266
I gotta admire that.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.068
Shit, I got a show.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.736
I got a show in, like,
half an hour.
Of course you got--

11:42.803 --> 11:44.104
I gotta--
Let me call a cab.
No, no, no.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.705
Hey, hey, Benny!

11:45.773 --> 11:47.540
Benny, you got
a car, right?

11:47.607 --> 11:49.442
We gotta take Louie!

11:52.279 --> 11:53.213
Out of the way!

11:57.484 --> 11:58.518
( all shouting and hollering )

11:58.585 --> 11:59.486
( whistling )

12:01.755 --> 12:03.490
Here we go.
Here we go.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
( all hollering )

12:07.027 --> 12:08.796
Hey!

12:08.862 --> 12:11.531
TÃº con curvas
y yo sin frenos!

12:11.598 --> 12:13.233
( all laughing )

12:13.300 --> 12:14.802
We're gonna get arrested
with this guy.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.736
( tires screeching )

12:16.804 --> 12:19.539
( shouting, laughing )

12:19.606 --> 12:22.575
Oh, shit,
oh, oh, oh!

12:22.642 --> 12:23.777
( whistling )

12:23.844 --> 12:26.079
( all )
Hey!

12:27.214 --> 12:28.849
( all laughing )

12:36.523 --> 12:37.290
Oye, Louie.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.126
Suerte esta noche,
brother, tÃ­rate.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.728
Okay, muchos
pantalones, man.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.530
( laughing )

12:43.596 --> 12:45.398
Hey, man, I made it.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.534
Couple minutes to spare,
so thanks.
Yeah, that's good, man.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.836
Thanks for coming,
you know?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.904
Hey, this is my
last show tonight

12:50.971 --> 12:52.639
and then I go home tomorrow,
so...
That's too bad.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.774
Well, you know,
life goes on.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.609
But you know what,
it was nice to meet you.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.579
And I wasn't drowning,

12:59.646 --> 13:01.849
but I'm glad you saved me.
Yeah.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.084
And it was good
to know you.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.685
Thanks for
making me laugh.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.855
Hey, okay.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.322
Have a good one.
Okay.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.893
Thanks, man.

13:26.840 --> 13:27.975
Hello?

13:28.041 --> 13:30.143
Hey, Janet, it's Louie.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.678
What's up?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.247
Well, I'm in Florida.
Right.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.715
You're coming back
tomorrow, right?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.150
You're gonna
pick up the girls?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.751
See, that's the thing,
I--

13:38.818 --> 13:40.520
If you can't
do this, it's okay,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.122
I just was wondering if maybe
you could keep the girls

13:42.189 --> 13:44.224
an extra couple nights.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.593
Um, yeah, shouldn't be
a problem.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.528
Are you stuck
down there?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
No, I just--

13:50.563 --> 13:52.199
I'm just thinking of staying
a couple days more, that's all.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.167
And again, if you can't do it,

13:54.234 --> 13:56.236
I'll pick up
the girls tomorrow.
I'm just checking.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.371
Oh.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.007
You met somebody.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.009
What?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.944
Oh, you met a girl

14:04.011 --> 14:05.278
and you want to stay down
there and be with her.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.846
That's fine.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.581
No, that's not what's
going on here.

14:08.648 --> 14:09.917
Well, why else would you
want to stay down there?

14:09.983 --> 14:12.119
You hate Florida.
You met someone.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.555
I didn't-- I mean,
I met somebody, but not--

14:15.622 --> 14:16.789
Oh, see?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.825
Good for you, Louie.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.327
We've been divorced
for three years.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.895
You don't have to
hide that shit from me.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.730
I'm glad for you.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.733
Stay in Florida for a couple
days, I'll cover for you.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.936
Enjoy your new someone.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.621
Hey.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.058
( Ramon )
Hey, man.
Hey.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.160
What are you doing here?

14:53.226 --> 14:56.196
I thought you left today.
No, I changed my flight.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.365
I'm going--
I'm staying 'til Wednesday.

14:58.431 --> 15:02.102
Okay. Cool.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.436
You going for a swim
or...

15:03.503 --> 15:05.238
Yeah, yeah.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.440
Well, I'm on break
so I'll join you.
Okay, all right.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.650
Let me get back in
the chair.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.152
Okay, man, yeah.
All right.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.054
Have a good one.
Yeah, you too.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.871
Ramon.
Hey, Louie.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.373
Hey.
What's up?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.509
Hey, how you doing?
Good.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.245
What are you--
You wanna hang out?

16:18.311 --> 16:21.048
What are you doing?
Yeah, uh...

16:21.114 --> 16:22.282
I got an idea.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.784
Let's, uh,
let's grab a drink.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.619
Yeah, okay.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.328
Hey, Louie, can I--

16:35.395 --> 16:37.430
Can I ask you
something?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.699
Yeah.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.002
It might be
a little weird

16:43.070 --> 16:45.105
kind of question,
but it's--

16:45.172 --> 16:46.873
It's just I been--

16:46.939 --> 16:50.710
Why did you
stay here longer?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.246
Oh, why-- why did I--

16:53.313 --> 16:55.782
Yeah.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.785
Well, I, you know...

16:58.851 --> 17:00.853
I just...

17:00.920 --> 17:02.889
Okay, you know,

17:02.955 --> 17:04.724
to be honest,
I just wanted to

17:04.791 --> 17:08.561
spend more time, you know,
hanging out and--

17:08.628 --> 17:11.298
Yeah, see--

17:11.364 --> 17:14.534
That's what I thought.
Yeah, but-- but-- but--
yeah, but...

17:14.601 --> 17:16.203
Look, I know what--

17:16.269 --> 17:18.105
I know what-- I know what--
I know what you're asking,

17:18.171 --> 17:20.607
but-- but--

17:20.673 --> 17:22.075
No, no, no, no.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.610
I mean, it's cool.
Yeah, yeah, no, no--

17:23.676 --> 17:26.045
It's me,
it's just that...
Yeah, but--

17:26.113 --> 17:27.714
It's just that I,
you know, I--

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
Yeah, but I'm not--

17:29.182 --> 17:31.118
I'm not--
Okay.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.653
Like, I don't--

17:33.720 --> 17:36.456
Like, I don't judge anybody.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
me neither, it's not--

17:36.523 --> 17:38.225
And I'm not--

17:38.291 --> 17:40.827
Okay, first of all, I have
zero anything, okay?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.962
Okay.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.897
I guess what--
the thing is is just that--

17:44.964 --> 17:46.065
I feel like--

17:46.133 --> 17:48.034
See, see?
No.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.769
I'm gonna stop you there.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.937
Okay, thank you.
Look, man.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.539
What--
My Uncle Chavo, right?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.607
Yeah.
When he said all men
are brothers?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.209
Mm-hmm.
Cool.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.510
It's true, man.
Right, right.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.479
And honestly,
you're a great guy.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.081
You're a great guy.
Cool, fun to hang out with.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.950
Same to you, you know.
It's...

18:04.016 --> 18:07.654
It's just... be yourself.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.988
You know what I mean?
What do you mean?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.623
No, what do you mean?
Be myself?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.325
Yeah, like...

18:12.392 --> 18:13.493
All right, I got this
cousin Manny, right?

18:13.560 --> 18:16.028
Oh, no, no,
yeah, but that...

18:16.095 --> 18:18.731
Ramon... I'm not...

18:21.801 --> 18:23.102
I...

18:23.170 --> 18:25.905
You-- you--
I just--

18:25.972 --> 18:27.507
It's-- it's not--

18:27.574 --> 18:29.409
It's like I don't know
if I've ever--

18:29.476 --> 18:31.811
I don't know
that I've ever--

18:31.878 --> 18:35.114
I'm not trying--
I'm not trying anything to...

18:35.182 --> 18:36.216
And I don't even--

18:36.283 --> 18:38.518
I mean, I'm not--

18:38.585 --> 18:39.986
I mean, dude.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.688
Okay, you know,
no, I know.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.055
I'm-- hey, man, y'know--

18:43.122 --> 18:45.091
Yeah, okay.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.059
All right, uh...
Okay.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.295
I don't take
anything back.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.197
You know what I mean?
Me neither, man.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.
It was fun, it was cool,
you know what I mean?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.833
And you're a good dude
and I wish you the best.
Yeah, you too, man.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.702
Hey, man, me too.
Yeah.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.936
Yeah, man, thanks a lot.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.070
Cool, man.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.939
Yeah.
Okay.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.241
Take it easy.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.516
( Louie )
Heterosexual men have a big
burden that we put on ourselves

19:09.582 --> 19:13.286
which is that we want to be
identified as heterosexual men.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.154
We're the only ones that care.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.324
We're the only sexual group
that gives a shit

19:17.390 --> 19:20.993
that we are not mistaken
for anything else.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.295
Nobody else cares.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.730
I don't know
any women that are

19:23.796 --> 19:26.299
worried someone will think
they're a lesbian.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.067
I've never heard a gay guy say,

19:28.134 --> 19:29.202
"Everybody's gonna think
I'm straight."

19:29.269 --> 19:30.637
It just doesn't happen.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.439
We're the only ones
that care,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.841
and it's a drag
for us because we--

19:34.907 --> 19:38.211
There's a lot of things
that we maybe could do

19:38.278 --> 19:40.680
that might be nice

19:40.747 --> 19:44.417
but we can't 'cause someone
will think we're gay.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.719
We can't even
throw some words around.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.223
You can't really throw
"wonderful" around so much.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.592
You can't say "wonderful"

19:52.659 --> 19:54.527
unless you say it, like,
in a gay voice to be funny.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.095
"Oh, it was wonderful."

19:56.162 --> 19:57.564
Like, you can do that
and "ha-ha-ha,"

19:57.630 --> 19:59.332
like I would
ever really say that.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.268
No, but it was wonderful,
it was.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.437
I can't just say
that about anything.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.240
No, that strip club
was wonderful.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.741
It was wonderful.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.592
Oh!

20:25.658 --> 20:29.362
Buddy--
buddy, I'm not--

20:29.429 --> 20:31.398
I'm not drowning,
I'm not--

20:31.464 --> 20:34.166
( Ramon )
Big waves,
relax, buddy, relax.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.636
I'm not drowning,
I'm telling you right now.
You're almost there.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.505
Okay, stop, freeze, freeze,
Miguel, freeze.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.707
Get ahead of us,
get ahead of us.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.675
Get ahead of us.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.876
Ready, ready?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.245
Everybody get ahead of us,
including Sean.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.415
Ready?
Yeah.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.751
Tell me when you're ready.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.653
You ready?
Go.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.021
Ready?
Yeah.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.989
And... action, guys!
