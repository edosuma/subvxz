Johnny Teatime. What ya thinkin'?

14:37.291 --> 14:38.416
[meows]

14:38.500 --> 14:43.250
Agreed. Yes. Johnny declares
it's like watching pathetic tiny babies

14:43.333 --> 14:45.291
learning how to crawl. [chuckles]

14:45.375 --> 14:46.583
His words, not mine.

14:47.541 --> 14:49.208
Hmm. Mmm.

14:49.291 --> 14:53.250
-You are real bad at this.
-Do you always talk at the same time?

14:53.333 --> 14:54.333
Yes.

14:55.375 --> 14:58.166
-Yes.
-Scram your behinds towards the moonlight!

14:58.250 --> 15:01.375
So, let me put this gently,
you're the worst out there

15:01.458 --> 15:04.125

of losing everything you've loved.

15:04.208 --> 15:05.791

And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.458

You've got to step it up.

You've got no style,
no poise, no Glitter Cats.

15:51.208 --> 15:53.875
And, as I feel my backstory
has clearly established,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.500
