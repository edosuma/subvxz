09:32.241 --> 09:35.664
Hey, isn't that that girl
from that time? Remember?

09:35.697 --> 09:37.974
Oh, yeah, the one who
wanted a photo with you

09:38.002 --> 09:39.882
because you were famous
for fucking your students?

09:39.917 --> 09:41.213
Yeah, that made me feel awesome.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.755
- Good times, dad.
- You should go talk to her.

09:42.797 --> 09:43.772
She's all by her lonesome over there.

09:43.952 --> 09:45.452
- Go on.
- She's not really my type.

09:45.509 --> 09:46.833
You don't have a type.

09:46.882 --> 09:48.396
Sure I do. Everyone has a type.

09:48.438 --> 09:49.474
Well, you shouldn't.

09:49.594 --> 09:50.375
You should be open

09:50.382 --> 09:53.262
to anything with a couple
"X" chromosomes, dude.

09:54.516 --> 09:56.192
Shit, she's staring right at me.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.324
- What do I do?
- [Mockingly] Aah!

09:57.357 --> 09:58.565
Wave at her.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.438
No, not like the Queen of England.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.928
Come here. Come with me.

10:02.142 --> 10:04.305
Look, somewhere inside you

10:04.338 --> 10:06.340
is the courage to put yourself out there.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.467
- Now reach in and grab it.
- Okay.

10:08.488 --> 10:12.005
Be funny, be charming,
be bold, motherfucker.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.263
- Hey, hey.
- What's up, prof?

10:14.383 --> 10:16.355
Nothing much, former student...

10:16.475 --> 10:18.905
Whose name I can't recall at this time.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.074
Apologies. You remember Levon.

10:20.116 --> 10:22.321
Yeah, you're the actor guy, right?

10:22.335 --> 10:23.701
- Not really, no.
- Yeah.

10:23.821 --> 10:25.021
Ow.

10:25.054 --> 10:27.624
- Okay, aspiring actor, yes.
- Right.

10:27.976 --> 10:29.592
You're Tara, right?

10:29.625 --> 10:31.590
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.724
I went to school with
this chick named Sara.

10:33.757 --> 10:35.778
She was retarded.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.299
Sorry. I guess you're not
supposed to say that anymore,

10:39.335 --> 10:42.130
but she was seriously mentally handicapped,

10:42.159 --> 10:43.617
like, really fucking tweaked.

10:43.617 --> 10:44.891
All the kids made fun of her and shit.

10:44.941 --> 10:47.140
I didn't because I always
felt pretty retarded myself.

10:47.701 --> 10:48.856
That's how I remembered.

10:48.877 --> 10:52.715
Sara, Tara... not that you're
retarded or tweaked or anything.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.842
Thank you.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.118
[Sighs]

10:58.434 --> 10:59.969
No, you're not like that at all.

11:00.018 --> 11:01.265
You're really pretty,

11:01.286 --> 11:02.490
and not in a generic way, like,

11:02.490 --> 11:04.201
"oh, you're so pretty,
do you want to dance?"

11:04.237 --> 11:06.060
You're, like, uniquely pretty.

11:06.093 --> 11:07.460
Like, there's probably no other girl

11:07.493 --> 11:08.996
in the world who looks exactly like you.

11:09.426 --> 11:11.525
And you've got this really cool vibe.

11:12.025 --> 11:13.298
You make me feel good...

11:13.331 --> 11:15.570
not in a creepy "my wiener
feels weird" kind of way.

11:15.690 --> 11:17.801
Like, happy good.

11:18.425 --> 11:20.798
It makes me want to get to know you better.

11:21.354 --> 11:23.685
Would you have a drink with me, Tara?

11:27.639 --> 11:29.031
Sure, Levon.

11:29.066 --> 11:32.256
- I'll have my own, but sure.
- Okay.

11:33.073 --> 11:35.573
I'm just gonna run to the
restroom real quick, okay?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.425
Hey, if you don't come back, it was

11:38.460 --> 11:39.932
nice to see you again.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.353
I'll be back, Levon. I promise.

11:42.386 --> 11:44.987
Cool.

11:45.419 --> 11:47.010
Watch out for the toilet paper.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.081
- Shh.
- It's rough stuff.

11:53.038 --> 11:56.836
Pow, pow, pow. [Laughs]

11:56.869 --> 11:58.559
I like how she says my name.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.373
That's the way it starts, my friend.

12:00.602 --> 12:02.229
- You did good.
- Thanks.

12:02.257 --> 12:03.503
Here, drinks are on me.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.285
Try to make it to dinner, okay?

12:05.334 --> 12:06.937
Dude, if I can get her
to have dinner with me,

12:06.978 --> 12:08.207
I can probably bang her outright...

12:08.242 --> 12:09.609
- No banging.
- No banging?

12:09.623 --> 12:11.345
Just talking, all right?

12:11.465 --> 12:12.530
What about fingering?

12:12.544 --> 12:13.636
I will break that finger right off.

12:13.671 --> 12:15.616
- [Yelps]
- Just enjoy her.

12:15.649 --> 12:18.502
And let her enjoy you, okay? All right?

12:18.741 --> 12:20.354
Try not to fart.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.424
I love you, you know that?

12:22.544 --> 12:24.892
I do. And I fucking love you too, dad.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.960
Good. Good, good, good.

12:27.016 --> 12:28.783
Having a dad is fucking awesome.

12:28.812 --> 12:30.502
Don't cry. Here she comes.

12:30.558 --> 12:31.572
I'm around if you need me.

12:31.579 --> 12:33.001
- Call me. Titty twister.
- Ow.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.881
You're back.

12:35.902 --> 12:38.274
- Hey.
- I just need one of those.

12:38.307 --> 12:40.743
Dirty old game they call pool, huh?

12:40.776 --> 12:42.912
Yeah, show me your best.

12:43.032 --> 12:45.744
- Okay. Oh, right there.
- The white one's the cue ball.

12:45.777 --> 12:49.788
- I'll be the stripes.
- [Billiard balls clack]

12:53.987 --> 12:56.322
[Door opens] Hey.

12:56.363 --> 12:58.624
- I think he's gonna be all right.
- Where is he?

12:58.657 --> 13:00.495
- He's with a girl.
- Alone?

13:00.528 --> 13:01.759
No, he's in a bar,

13:01.792 --> 13:03.576
just like us once upon a time.

13:03.611 --> 13:05.133
- Did you pay her?
- Not a dime.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.294
- No, he did it all himself.
- Oh, that's good.

13:07.414 --> 13:08.329
Yeah.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.338
I hope he doesn't take his penis out.

13:10.371 --> 13:13.040
I hope he does... at the appropriate time.

13:13.076 --> 13:14.963
No, seriously, Julia,

13:15.252 --> 13:16.716
I think he's gonna be fine.

13:16.836 --> 13:18.474
I really do.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.042
No, honestly, getting to know him, just...

13:21.162 --> 13:22.893
he's been maybe

13:22.905 --> 13:25.206
the most pleasant
surprise of my adult life.

13:25.428 --> 13:27.142
Mm.

13:27.175 --> 13:28.942
Thank you.

13:29.978 --> 13:31.197
I know the feeling.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.021
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

13:41.325 --> 13:42.656
Wait. Hold on.

13:43.051 --> 13:44.600
Don't you fucking cock-block yourself.

13:44.621 --> 13:46.016
No, no, no, I want to do this right.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.197
You mean, like, with protection?

13:48.227 --> 13:49.516
I think I have condoms somewhere.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.987
No, no, no, I want to
take you out to dinner...

13:52.192 --> 13:54.019
Tonight, all right?

13:54.607 --> 13:55.635
I like dinner.

13:55.663 --> 13:56.557
- You like dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.593 --> 13:57.776
All right, that settles it, then.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.734
- Okay.
- We're on, all right.

14:01.220 --> 14:04.621
Oh, wear your best dress.
Leave those underwear at home.

14:04.659 --> 14:07.033
[Both laugh]

14:17.774 --> 14:19.373
Kruller, looking good.

14:19.406 --> 14:20.150
Hello, Hank.

14:20.270 --> 14:22.981
- Where's Baldo?
- He's in the guest room.

14:23.312 --> 14:25.030
Say hello to Love.

14:25.227 --> 14:26.734
- Hello, Love.
- Hello.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.411
- As you were.
- All right.

14:28.686 --> 14:29.885
- [Moans]
- That's it.

14:29.919 --> 14:31.085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:31.118 --> 14:32.192
Ooh.

14:32.312 --> 14:34.228
Oh, what the fuck is this?

14:34.256 --> 14:35.653
What does it look like?

14:35.686 --> 14:37.010
Why in my bedroom?

14:37.291 --> 14:39.630
I can't fuck another woman
in my marital bed, Hank.

14:39.663 --> 14:41.587
- That's sick.
- Class up the ass, Runks...

14:41.622 --> 14:43.298
class up the fucking ass.

14:43.418 --> 14:45.890
You shouldn't have done
this. It's not worth it.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.172
This shit is never worth
it... no disrespect, Milady.

14:48.292 --> 14:50.757
- You are a work of art.
- Thank you.

14:51.109 --> 14:53.989
- I didn't do anything, Hank.
- Yeah, he couldn't get it up.

14:54.031 --> 14:55.144
I did everything I could.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.109
It was like nibbling on
a piece of string cheese.

14:57.151 --> 14:59.102
It's really making me
question my chosen career path.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.926
No, no, no, it's not you.

15:00.954 --> 15:03.144
But you really should consider
going back to law school.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.088
It's definitely not you.

15:05.116 --> 15:06.834
This kid is an absolute fucking mess,

15:06.854 --> 15:08.954
but you should go back to school.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.516
Now, this is great news, Runks.

15:10.636 --> 15:12.939
Put your limp dick away,
get in your girly car,

15:12.939 --> 15:14.517
and drive up to Stu's posthaste.

15:14.517 --> 15:15.828
You got to put an end to this shit.

15:15.861 --> 15:17.525
You'll thank me later. You are welcome.

15:17.558 --> 15:19.214
She probably already fucked him, Hank...

15:19.242 --> 15:21.024
- twice, three times.
- Four times a lady.

15:21.031 --> 15:22.587
You'll never know if you don't try.

15:22.636 --> 15:24.489
Now be bold, you fucking ninny.

15:25.034 --> 15:27.869
There you go. Put some clothes on.

15:27.904 --> 15:29.615
You look like someone
dragged you out of the river.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.323
I'm sorry it didn't work out,

15:31.327 --> 15:33.474
but we could get together
sometime for lunch maybe,

15:33.507 --> 15:34.844
with my wife or not.

15:34.877 --> 15:36.713
We'll see. We'll see.

15:37.122 --> 15:39.747
Um, hey, would you mind
if I practice on you?

15:39.780 --> 15:41.385
- Practice what?
- Sex.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.262
- Oh...
- Thanks for everything, Krull.

15:43.325 --> 15:44.558
That is tempting.

15:45.051 --> 15:47.322
But, you know, I've already
turned down sex once today,

15:47.355 --> 15:48.993
and I think I can do it again.

15:49.026 --> 15:50.392
Are you sure?

15:50.425 --> 15:52.488
- Yeah.
- Aw.

15:52.529 --> 15:53.560
- No.
- No?

15:53.593 --> 15:55.264
Yeah. No.

15:55.298 --> 15:56.497
Yes.

15:56.530 --> 15:57.671
No.

15:57.727 --> 16:00.016
Yes. Be gone, Harlot.

16:00.136 --> 16:01.333
I've got writing to do.

16:01.371 --> 16:03.306
And get your ass back in school.

16:11.781 --> 16:15.363
- We have done it all, Marcy.
- [Sighs]

16:15.483 --> 16:17.912
We swam. We played tennis. We had lunch.

16:17.953 --> 16:20.615
We meditated. We did some
yoga. We had massages.

16:20.648 --> 16:22.714
The only things we haven't done is fuck!

16:23.791 --> 16:26.821
My balls are so swollen right now.

16:26.854 --> 16:29.257
- [Clears throat]
- Please...

16:29.726 --> 16:32.186
[Sighs] Take me in your mouth.

16:32.229 --> 16:33.616
What?

16:33.658 --> 16:36.458
The contract doesn't say
anything about blow jobs, Stu.

16:36.499 --> 16:37.799
Intercourse only.

16:37.828 --> 16:40.499
Hey, hey, blow jobs are implied.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.088
Get a better lawyer.

16:42.095 --> 16:42.940
Okay, fine.

16:42.982 --> 16:45.276
Is it all right if I penetrate you, then?

16:45.609 --> 16:47.757
I just feel so weird about all this.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.109
Well, of course it's weird.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.018
It's like riding a bicycle.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.110
I mean, once big daddy
enters the rain forest,

16:56.124 --> 16:58.082
all will be right with the world.

16:59.021 --> 16:59.885
You know what?

17:00.005 --> 17:02.390
I have to check and see
if the money transferred.

17:02.423 --> 17:04.856
- You don't trust me!
- Why would I trust you?

17:04.919 --> 17:06.750
You're a fucking crazy person, Stu.

17:06.763 --> 17:09.201
You go ahead and check. I have to pee.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.082
Do you know how difficult it is to urinate

17:12.107 --> 17:14.872
with an erection this size?

17:26.602 --> 17:29.489
What the actual fuck?

17:38.353 --> 17:41.099
What the fuck is this?

17:41.599 --> 17:44.036
Oh. Um...

17:45.217 --> 17:46.858
this is quite embarrassing.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.282
Not to mention really fucking creepy.

17:49.331 --> 17:53.269
You know, this is not as
creepy as you may think.

17:53.867 --> 17:57.269
She is my loving tribute to you.

17:57.302 --> 17:58.974
Isn't she beautiful?

17:59.007 --> 18:00.818
She's a fuck doll, Stu.

18:00.825 --> 18:04.459
She's an expensive fuck doll... 15 large.

18:04.473 --> 18:05.691
But...

18:06.918 --> 18:08.735
But she's so much more than that.

18:09.751 --> 18:12.220
She's a woman, just like you.

18:12.922 --> 18:16.319
And I have made love to her,
just like I made love to you.

18:16.868 --> 18:18.730
Want me to show you?

18:18.764 --> 18:22.298
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
This is too fucking weird.

18:22.339 --> 18:23.835
You need help, Stu.

18:23.868 --> 18:26.066
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Marcy, Marcy. No, no! No.

18:26.108 --> 18:27.990
Don't... don't go. Don't go.

18:28.003 --> 18:29.672
Look, I paid you a million dollars

18:29.679 --> 18:31.182
so I could fuck you, woman.

18:31.215 --> 18:33.183
The least you could do is let me fuck you.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.341
Come here.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.150
- No, don't fight it.
- Oh, oh.

18:36.207 --> 18:37.351
Don't fight it.

18:37.391 --> 18:39.507
I will pepper you with kisses,

18:39.532 --> 18:41.697
and you will remember what it is like...

What, you're gonna rape me now?

18:43.363 --> 18:44.934
Oh, come on, Marcy!

18:44.967 --> 18:46.639
How many rape games have we played?

18:46.672 --> 18:48.606
Requested by you, no less.

18:48.639 --> 18:51.206
Those are games, Stu!
"No" means "no," you know!

18:51.247 --> 18:52.976

- Ow!

18:53.017 --> 18:54.513
Is that the safe word?

18:55.639 --> 18:57.184
Don't do it, Marcy!

18:57.217 --> 18:58.569
Oh!

18:58.889 --> 19:00.890
Oh, my God.

19:00.923 --> 19:02.627
I was totally hoping that you would make

19:02.660 --> 19:04.366
some lame attempt to rescue me.

19:04.399 --> 19:06.872
Am I too late? Did you guys already fuck?

19:06.905 --> 19:08.369
No!

19:08.402 --> 19:09.570

No, he didn't even finger me.

19:19.513 --> 19:20.894
I didn't.

19:21.014 --> 19:23.094

19:28.810 --> 19:31.984

19:32.007 --> 19:33.503
a really terrible idea.

You fucked with our marriage.

19:54.124 --> 19:56.019
I could sue you for
alienation of affection.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.123
Yeah, and you would lose, motherfucker.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.894
Maybe, but I could still leak a story

19:59.926 --> 20:01.892

20:01.933 --> 20:04.130

Listen, I realize I have sinned.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.552

20:20.585 --> 20:21.983
I'm sorry, guys.
