WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:10.218
Man, it's weird being down here
without getting booked, huh?

00:10.302 --> 00:12.220
-Yeah.
-And being sober.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.472
And wearing pants.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.019
Hey, you think they keep our old mugshots?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.396
'Cause my hair looked really great
in that last one.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.481
See if I could get a wallet size.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.861
Who would've thought we'd be the ones
picking up Mom, huh?

00:28.945 --> 00:30.030
[Colt chuckles]

00:30.113 --> 00:33.116
It's like the day when you beat your dad
at driveway basketball.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.661
It's fun,
but shit just ain't never the same.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.582
Only time Dad ever shot a basketball
was with a rifle.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.666
[chuckles]

00:42.667 --> 00:45.837
Hey, you know what?
I talked to Peterson again.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.173
I really wanna buy that ranch.

00:48.756 --> 00:51.426
Yeah, well,
I'd really like to bang Kate Winslet,

00:51.509 --> 00:53.220
but don't see that happening.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.099
Whoa, Kate Winslet's your go-to?

00:57.182 --> 00:59.934
Titanic  came out
at a really important time of my life.

01:00.017 --> 01:02.062
Plus, she gets naked in that movie.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.440
That ship was going down...
something else was going up.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.070
It's just, Peterson's giving us
such a great deal.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.240
And for the down payment,
I'll throw in whatever cash I got.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.618
The rest, we can put in the money we got
from the calf sale last year.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.869
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.122
We can use the money
we need to run the ranch.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.373
You know what else we could do?

01:21.456 --> 01:24.000
We could, uh, sell our house
and buy a whole bunch of candy.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.796
I thought about it.
Give me your dip can.

01:30.923 --> 01:31.966
All right.

01:32.634 --> 01:36.554
This dip can...
that's our operating money, right?

01:38.348 --> 01:41.893
This pinch right here...
this is our expenses for one month.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.398
Fuckin' peach, are you serious?

01:47.190 --> 01:49.442
What? Makes your mouth taste like cobbler.

01:50.902 --> 01:55.072
Anyway, we use the rest of this money
for a down payment.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.491
Dude, what the fuck?

01:56.574 --> 01:58.660
What the fuck, right?

01:59.244 --> 02:03.831
Our operating money is gone.
Oh, wait, what? What's this?

02:03.915 --> 02:08.044
It's a whole can of
wintergreen-flavored pipeline money.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.464
Soon as we get the check,
we put it in the bank,

02:11.548 --> 02:14.509
replace the money we took.
Boom. Golden.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.179
Fuck, this peach is fucking delicious.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.556
[chuckles] Yeah, told ya.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.184
You wanna get kids hooked on tobacco,
that's the move right there.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.978
[sighs] I don't know.
You wanna try and make this work?

02:26.062 --> 02:27.104
We're gonna need a loan.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.150
Yeah. Well, you worked with Bill
down at the bank, right?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.108
Yeah, I mean, you know...

02:32.319 --> 02:34.654
he ran the accounts
when I was running the bar.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.406
Actually, you know, Bill owes me a favor.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.032
Last time he was in there,
he got so shitfaced,

02:38.115 --> 02:40.327
he passed out,
left the keys to the bank at the bar.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.539
-You just brought 'em back to him?
-'Course.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.042
Gave them to the nighttime security guard
at the bank...

02:48.125 --> 02:50.837
right after I discovered there was
a nighttime security guard at the bank.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.549
Look, don't matter.
We'll talk to Bill about the loan,

02:54.632 --> 02:55.633
then we go talk to Dad.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.386
All right, I'm in.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.930
Fuck yeah! [exhales sharply]

03:01.013 --> 03:02.307
Here's your personal belongings.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.477
Oh, thanks. Sorry about
that whole filthy-fucking-pig thing.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.561
Say hi to your mom.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.110
What's up, Wilkerson?

03:16.946 --> 03:19.532
Hey, Wilkerson, you ever get déjà vu?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.623
[theme song playing]

04:28.100 --> 04:29.936
What'd you get arrested for anyway?

04:30.478 --> 04:34.316
Me and this guy chained ourselves
to a bulldozer.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.775
It was nice.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.319
He had hummus.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.281
All right, so now you went to jail.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.325
Quit this stupid protest?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.992
Stupid? Yeah.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.828
Sorry it's not as noble as protesting

04:46.911 --> 04:50.164
the high price of beer
at the Broncos game.

04:50.247 --> 04:52.249
Eleven dollars!

04:52.334 --> 04:55.211
How's a family of four
supposed to get fucked up?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.631
What are you doing this for?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.759
You ain't gonna win, so why you fighting?

05:01.843 --> 05:04.011
The only reason
you guys care about this at all

05:04.095 --> 05:05.888
is because you're profiting off of it.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.475
No, that is not true.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.603
This pipeline's gonna bring a lot of jobs
right where people need it, okay?

05:11.686 --> 05:14.188
Everyone's excited. Like, my boy Shaggy,

05:14.271 --> 05:17.400
he's talking about giving up cooking meth
and going back to welding.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.738
Those pipeline jobs,
they're only temporary.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.323
It's like the county fair.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.492
When it's here, it's fun,
but when it leaves,

05:25.575 --> 05:27.744
there's nothing left
but a patch of oily grass

05:27.827 --> 05:29.537
where they deep-fried the Snickers.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.708
Yeah, last year they had
deep-fried fried chicken.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.794
Saw a baby have a heart attack.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.506
Still, it was fucking delicious.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.177
You know, you wouldn't be so gung ho
about this pipeline thing

05:45.261 --> 05:48.473
if the government came in
and instituted eminent domain.

05:48.556 --> 05:53.478
I don't know. My first question would be,
"What the fuck is eminent domain?"

05:55.187 --> 05:56.898
You can't just make shit up, Mom.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.818
It'd be like if the government
all of a sudden said,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.987
"We're no longer gonna
call February 'February.'

06:03.070 --> 06:04.906
From now on, it's Toyotathon.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.451
January, Toyotathon, March."

06:09.577 --> 06:10.828
Colt, don't be an idiot, man.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.039
Everybody knows what eminent domain is,
all right?

06:13.122 --> 06:14.957
"The right of a government

06:15.041 --> 06:17.293
or its agent to expropriate
private properties."

06:17.376 --> 06:19.295
-[both chuckle]
-[Maggie tsks]

06:20.838 --> 06:23.633
It means they can take your property
and not pay you.

06:24.467 --> 06:28.095
Sort of how you eminent domain
beers from my bar.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.557
Yeah, they're payin' us for it.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.850
They're not paying everyone.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.352
In Montana, they took land
from the reservation

06:35.437 --> 06:37.021
and the tribe had no say in it.

06:37.104 --> 06:39.106
Well, it serves them right.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.693
They took two grand from me
at an Indian casino.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.902
I didn't have no say in it.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.782
Look, we don't gotta like the company
to do business with them, all right?

06:47.865 --> 06:50.952
You know, I still go buy wood
from Denny down at the lumber yard

06:51.035 --> 06:52.620
even though he's a Raiders fan.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.622
[imitating Denny] "Hey,
Raiders beat Broncos."

06:54.706 --> 06:55.998
[in normal voice] Oh, yeah, Denny?
Guess what?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.084
I used to fuck your wife
back in high school. See you.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.168
[Colt chuckles]

07:00.252 --> 07:04.340
You're right. I change my mind.
I now support the pipeline.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.634
Yeah. I'm getting married soon.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.136
We want you to be involved in the wedding,

07:09.220 --> 07:10.763
not risking getting run over

07:10.847 --> 07:13.099
by a bulldozer
that you're layin' in front of.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.893
Wait, you got arrested
for the exact same thing.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.938
No, I passed out in front of a bulldozer.

07:24.151 --> 07:27.321
I need some help from you and your brother
ear-tagging those calves.

07:28.155 --> 07:29.365
Where is he?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.618
Well, I told him you didn't trust him,

07:31.701 --> 07:35.830
which is why I was out there helping him
fix that gatepost down by the corral.

07:35.913 --> 07:39.166
He's like, "What? Screw that.
I can do it by myself. Go inside."

07:39.250 --> 07:42.879
So now I'm in here,
eating lunch, drinking a beer.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.380
He's out there fixing the gate.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.761
Let's try that again.
Where's your brother?

07:49.844 --> 07:50.887
He's outside.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.847
Was that so fucking hard?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.059
-Did you talk to Mom?
-No.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.770
-You going to?
-No.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.229
Obviously,
you don't want to talk about it,

08:00.312 --> 08:01.355
so I'm just gonna drop it.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.191
Was that so fucking hard?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.861
[knocking on door]

08:08.946 --> 08:09.947
Hey, Jen.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.575
Hey, Beau. Rooster.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.494
Hmm. Engineer Jennifer, you look lovely.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.454
Thanks. You look... the same.

08:19.123 --> 08:23.210
I brought over the final contracts
you approved.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.129
All that's left is for you to sign.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.300
Good Lord, how many signatures
do you need?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.219
Fifteen signatures, five initials

08:32.303 --> 08:34.388
and we typically ask
for a first-born child,

08:34.471 --> 08:36.974
but since it's Rooster,
we're gonna waive it.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.063
Fifteen signatures.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.941
If you need a fingerprint,
I know which finger I'm using.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.987
Man, Dad wouldn't even sign
my permission slips back in school.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.156
One time, I had to sit in the library.

08:52.239 --> 08:54.867
My whole class was up
at the Denver Zoo on a field trip.

08:55.492 --> 08:58.204
I'm sitting there re-shelving books
with Ms. Damone.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.748
They all got to see two baboons fucking.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.877
Charming.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.464
Oh, uh, here's the amendment
you requested.

09:08.548 --> 09:13.135
"Keep your black helicopters
and drones off my goddamn property."

09:15.346 --> 09:17.890
-Looks good all printed up like that.
-[Jen] Mmm-hmm.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.436
Are these, uh,
protesters gonna affect anything?

09:22.519 --> 09:25.773
No, most of them are vegan.
They're very weak.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.859
A few hours in the sun
and they'll pack it in.

09:29.902 --> 09:33.948
I'm kidding. No, we deal with this
kind of thing all the time. We'll be fine.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.243
All right, there you go.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.327
[Jen sighs]

09:38.410 --> 09:40.663
Even though you said I didn't have to...

09:40.747 --> 09:42.414
I threw in Rooster.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.046
Great. So once we officially break ground,

09:49.130 --> 09:51.298
we'll wire the funds
directly into your account.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.886
In the meantime,
I'll take these back to my lair

09:54.969 --> 09:58.514
and continue my plot
to destroy the environment.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.601
Oh, come on, I'm funny.

10:04.020 --> 10:08.107
Well... finally did it, Daddy.
We sold out.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.317
Feels good.

10:12.319 --> 10:13.863
All right, I'll see you later.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.326
Hey, Jen, wait up.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.246
Okay, let me save you some time.

10:22.329 --> 10:24.749
No, it did not hurt
when I fell from Heaven.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.876
And no, I'm not from Tennessee,

10:26.959 --> 10:30.672
despite the fact that I am
the only ten you see.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.843
[chuckles] No,
I'm not out here to hit on you.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.261
Although, those two are pretty good.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.388
Hey, you ever heard this one?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.349
"Heard you're looking for a stud.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.812
Well, I got the S-T-D.
All I need is you."

10:51.317 --> 10:55.738
I don't know what surprises me more,
that that works or that you can spell.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.827
Look, I just wanna say maybe I came on
a little strong the other day.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.954
-The other day?
-All right, every day.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.959
But I think if you gave the Rooster
another chance, he might surprise you.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.420
When you're trying to be nice,
do you have to speak in the third person?

11:13.172 --> 11:14.673
I don't know.
Maybe the Rooster does.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.135
Rooster's joking with that one.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.098
-Shit, Rooster can't stop.
-[chuckles]

11:22.181 --> 11:24.683
Look, Rooster, I'm flattered.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.478
And you're not a bad guy,
you're just not my type.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.480
And honestly, I don't think I'm yours.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.690
The Jen is sorry.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.904
I think the Jen might change her mind
if she heard the Rooster's plan.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.990
It actually involves a third person.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.699
[laughs]

11:41.743 --> 11:44.912
You'd have a better shot at a threesome
with those two baboons.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.419
Oh, say Marco.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.213
Marco.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.173
Bolo. Where'd you get
that stupid fucking tie?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.347
It's my interviewing tie.

12:03.430 --> 12:06.558
It says, "I know my business,
but I also might have a gun." [chuckles]

12:07.810 --> 12:10.396
I think it says, "Redneck prom."

12:12.940 --> 12:14.233
Still good.

12:17.444 --> 12:19.238
Oh, hey.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
-Bill, hey!
-How's it going?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.076
What's up, Bill?
Hey, that's a strong beard, huh?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.120
Actually, I was just trying
to cover a rash.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.665
Oh, all right.
Well, that's badass, too.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.458
Hey, thanks for meeting us
on your day off.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.127
-Oh, uh, no problem.
-Yeah.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.630
My, uh, daughter just turned 17
and discovered she hates her mother,

12:36.713 --> 12:38.257
so it's a great time
to get out of the house.

12:38.340 --> 12:39.425
[Rooster chuckles]

12:39.967 --> 12:42.594
Oh, uh, nice tie, by the way.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.014
Thank you.

12:45.973 --> 12:49.643
You know, my dad used to bring me
to this place when I was a little kid.

12:49.726 --> 12:52.897
-Oh, yeah? You grew up around here?
-Oh, yeah, uh, dairy farm over in Ridgway.

12:52.980 --> 12:56.025
Mmm. It's over by the rendering plant?

12:56.108 --> 12:58.027
Yep. Whole town smells like death.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.031
So, uh, how's a farm kid become a banker?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.492
Oh, uh, well, my dad thought
that farming was too unpredictable,

13:05.576 --> 13:08.120
so, uh, he used every penny he had
and sent me to college.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.248
Uh, but while I was away,
he had a couple of rough years

13:11.332 --> 13:13.750
and the bank foreclosed on his farm.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.337
Piece-of-shit bankers.
They should all die.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.800
Not you, Bill.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.055
Anyway, uh, after my dad lost his place,

13:26.138 --> 13:28.724
I knew I had to come back
and try to keep the town going.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.143
You know, all the places that I went to
as a kid are disappearing.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.480
Uh, the pharmacy, the barbershop...

13:34.563 --> 13:35.689
Clark's Zoo.

13:35.772 --> 13:39.401
Well, I guess it was less a zoo and more
Clark just puttin' animals in cages.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.404
But when you're a kid,
that's just magical.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.614
[Colt chuckles]

13:44.240 --> 13:47.118
I remember going to that place.
I got bit by a woodchuck.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.453
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

13:49.536 --> 13:52.373
You had to get six rabies shots
in your stomach.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.291
That was awesome. [chuckles]

13:55.292 --> 13:57.419
Then you bit me and I had to get 'em, too.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.964
All right, all right, let's talk shop.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.424
So last year, the Animas River spill

14:02.508 --> 14:05.386
actually increased the value
of your land and your herd.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.846
The fish in the river
are now growing hair,

14:07.930 --> 14:09.306
but you guys are in good shape.

14:10.682 --> 14:13.269
Maybe you should dip your head
in that river, Bill.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.275
What? I'm kidding.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.030
Plus, you're getting
a great deal from Peterson.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.199
So even though you guys are gonna be
stretching a little thin,

14:27.283 --> 14:28.868
I'm gonna go ahead and approve the loan.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.494
-[Colt chuckles]
-Whoa! Are you serious?

14:30.577 --> 14:32.829
[sighs] Oh. "I'm gonna go ahead
and approve the loan."

14:32.914 --> 14:34.790
That's the best sentence I've heard since,

14:34.874 --> 14:37.376
"The Breathalyzer's busted.
Get home safe." [chuckles]

14:38.920 --> 14:41.881
So, uh, let's go over the terms.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.550
Uh, here is how much you guys
are gonna be putting down...

14:44.633 --> 14:47.929
-Yep.
-Oh, and here is your monthly payment.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.348
Okay. Yeah. What's, uh...
what's all these numbers down here?

14:51.432 --> 14:53.100
Oh. Uh, it's closing costs.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.937
Uh, loan fees, appraisal fees,
title insurance...

14:56.020 --> 14:58.355
Oh. Yeah, we don't need those.

15:00.816 --> 15:04.778
Oh, well, these aren't negotiable.

15:04.861 --> 15:08.115
It's not like when my first wife asked me
to pay for her boob job

15:08.199 --> 15:09.408
as a part of our divorce.

15:12.703 --> 15:16.415
Yeah, well. Here's the thing, Bill.
This is a lot of extra cash, you know?

15:16.498 --> 15:19.293
Yeah, we're putting everything we got
into that down payment.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.587
Oh, well. I don't know what to say.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.798
I mean, if you guys can't come up
with the money to pay these fees,

15:24.881 --> 15:26.508
we can't move forward with the loan.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.187
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.733
What are you doing up here? [sighs]

15:43.525 --> 15:45.945
-Just thinking about jumping.
-Oh.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.822
Remember, I want my ashes sprinkled

15:48.905 --> 15:50.866
into a protein shake
that Tom Brady drinks,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.534
so I can finally win a Super Bowl.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.455
I know.
You left me very detailed instructions.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.457
And if there's anything left,
the rest goes in the milk

15:58.540 --> 15:59.791
-at the Indy 500.
-Indy 500.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.048
-How did you find me?
-Oh, Rooster told me.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.095
He also told me what happened with Bill.

16:12.804 --> 16:13.847
I'm sorry.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.807
Yep.

16:19.686 --> 16:22.856
You know, I finally let myself think
that all of this was gonna be ours.

16:22.939 --> 16:23.940
[chuckles]

16:24.900 --> 16:26.860
I forgot how beautiful it is.

16:28.570 --> 16:32.324
[chuckles] God, you remember when
Mr. Peterson had that haunted hayride

16:32.408 --> 16:34.076
and we made out underneath the hay?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.913
-No, we didn't.
-Oh.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.082
Is that an eagle?

16:45.379 --> 16:46.713
This kills me, Ab.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.511
It's, like, I came so close...

16:53.637 --> 16:56.015
and now I gotta give up on the dream.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.224
Well...

16:59.351 --> 17:00.352
Maybe not.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.230
Here.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.443
-What's that?
-It's money I put aside for the wedding.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.029
-You can use it to close the deal.
-No. No way.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.780
[chuckles] Why not?

17:12.614 --> 17:15.201
Because... I'm supposed to be
the one providing.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.328
That's the whole point
of getting this ranch.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.996
If I can't give you a nice wedding
and a home,

17:20.081 --> 17:21.582
what kind of man am I?

17:22.416 --> 17:23.875
I'm not taking your money.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.796
This is not the 1950s.
We're in this together.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.591
We provide for each other.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.177
This money is supposed to be used
for something that makes us happy.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.929
And buying this ranch
would make me much happier

17:36.012 --> 17:38.014
than paying for a huge tent and a band

17:38.099 --> 17:40.476
just so Rooster can fill up
all the disposable cameras

17:40.559 --> 17:42.103
with pictures of his balls.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.775
-Abby...
-It's not up for debate.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.201
-You sure?
-Yes.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.376
[Abby chuckles]

18:07.002 --> 18:08.003
Thank you.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.882
So, are we doing this?

18:11.965 --> 18:14.551
Yeah. We're doing this.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.553
Fuck yeah! [chuckles]

18:16.637 --> 18:19.473
-Oh, I brought champagne to celebrate.
-[chuckles] What?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.851
-Miller High Life.
-The champagne of beers!

18:22.934 --> 18:24.145
[both chuckle]

18:24.228 --> 18:25.437
You know me so well.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.688
I love you.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.316
-[mouthing] I love you.
-[chuckles]

18:36.740 --> 18:39.618
All right. Are we gonna have sex
in a tree?

18:39.701 --> 18:43.414
No. We'll save our sex-in-a-tree days
to Millwood Park.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.250
What... Again, not me.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.128
What the fuck?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.176
Hey, Dad, you got a minute to...

18:55.259 --> 18:56.802
Holy shit, you drinking wine?

19:00.055 --> 19:01.932
You idiots drank all the beer.

19:02.015 --> 19:06.145
What? No.
I just bought a case of Bud yesterday.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.397
[scoffs] You like wine!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.731
[chuckles]

19:11.442 --> 19:13.485
-Joanne bought it.
-[Colt] Uh-huh.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.529
-And it's going bad.
-[chuckles]

19:15.612 --> 19:17.531
And you know what? New rule.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.534
If you're over 30
and don't live with your parents,

19:20.617 --> 19:22.911
you can drink whatever the fuck you want.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.497
[chuckles]

19:25.581 --> 19:28.542
Hey, you know what? This is perfect.
We got to talk to you about something.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.752
Why don't you sit down,
turn off the  Sex and the City,

19:30.836 --> 19:32.671
-and enjoy your chardonnay.
-[Colt laughs]

19:36.425 --> 19:39.761
It's sauvignon blank, asshole.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.930
[chuckles] Sit down.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.058
All right. Here's the scoop.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.063
[sighs] We were talking about it.

19:51.898 --> 19:53.484
We want to buy Peterson's ranch.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.569
Not this again.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.154
How many times do I have to say no?

19:58.239 --> 20:01.116
It's like the goddamn pizza oven
all over again.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.161
Look, you wouldn't be saying that
if you had a nice white pizza

20:05.246 --> 20:07.456
to pair with your sauvignon blank.

20:11.001 --> 20:15.339
Now, listen. Things have changed
since we talked about this last.

20:15.922 --> 20:19.510
Yesterday, we met with Bill
from down at the bank.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.470
He says we can make a deal.

20:21.553 --> 20:25.724
All we got to do is come up with
the down payment, he'll give us the loan.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.685
Yeah, and if they'd have
cured polio faster,

20:28.769 --> 20:31.897
your Uncle Carl wouldn't have
two different sized shoes.

20:35.191 --> 20:36.735
We don't have the money.

20:36.818 --> 20:40.531
Dad, I'm putting in every penny I got.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.658
And Abby threw in the money
from the wedding.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.036
So, with the rest we can bridge it
with the money we got in the account,

20:46.119 --> 20:48.789
and then soon as the pipeline money
comes in, we'll replace it.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.374
Are you kidding me?

20:51.082 --> 20:53.877
That account has to last
until we get the calves to market.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.004
No, Dad. You heard Engineer Jen.

20:56.087 --> 20:58.299
She said the money's gonna be here
in a week or two, okay?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.301
The Peterson ranch won't be.
It's a slam dunk.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.511
Just like that pizza oven would have been.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.058
Never would've had
to order Domino's again.

21:09.893 --> 21:15.065
Dad, this is our chance to get the land
that butts right up next to ours

21:15.148 --> 21:17.526
and you know I'm serious 'cause
I just said "butts up next to ours"

21:17.609 --> 21:19.320
and I didn't even make a joke.

21:22.113 --> 21:23.114
Butts up.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.868
-That's my favorite butt direction.
-[chuckles]

21:27.744 --> 21:28.995
I know, right? [chuckles]

21:30.121 --> 21:34.376
Look, the point is, Peterson's place
is already running on a profit

21:34.460 --> 21:37.796
and he's offering us a way better deal
than what Neumann's Hill is paying.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.966
Did you guys really run all this by Bill?

21:41.049 --> 21:42.133
-Yep.
-Yeah.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.135
He says he thinks we should do it.

21:44.219 --> 21:47.723
Dad, you always tell us
that a man doesn't talk,

21:47.806 --> 21:48.890
he takes action.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.601
Well, this is us taking action.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.104
Actually,
this is us talking about taking action.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.484
I do appreciate
you taking the initiative...

21:59.318 --> 22:01.027
and you make some good points.

22:02.028 --> 22:04.740
I'll tell you what, I'll think about it.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.994
All right, cool.
Well, thanks a lot, Dad.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.204
No.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.040
Excuse me?

22:15.917 --> 22:16.918
No.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.630
You can't think about it.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.758
Hey, Colt, you wanna do me a favor
and shut the fuck up?

22:26.052 --> 22:27.053
Look...

22:28.138 --> 22:32.350
I'm sorry, Dad, but you got
all the information you need.

22:32.934 --> 22:37.398
We got till Friday to do this
and this chance ain't coming around again.

22:37.481 --> 22:41.067
This is our shot.
So, no, you can't go think about it.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.071
All right. You know what?
This was all Colt's idea. I'm out.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.786
You know, you...

22:51.495 --> 22:55.707
you always talked to us about
how much this ranch means to you.

22:56.332 --> 22:58.084
About keeping it in the family.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.921
How much... how much longer
do you realistically think

23:01.004 --> 23:02.005
we're gonna be able to do that?

23:02.881 --> 23:05.426
Sure, you know,
we'll get through a year, two.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.052
What, maybe ten.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.137
How long you think it's gonna be

23:09.220 --> 23:12.348
till one of these corporate jobs comes in
and just scoops us up?

23:13.892 --> 23:18.063
You think this place is gonna be around
for my kids or my kids' kids?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.650
You're just fooling yourself.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.962
You know,
when my grandfather started this place,

23:42.045 --> 23:43.547
he was just farming it.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.675
They were barely getting by.

23:48.594 --> 23:52.347
Then my dad convinced him
to take what little money they had

23:52.430 --> 23:54.850
and start running cows.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.312
Two generations later, we're still here.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.650
You know what? Fuck it.

24:04.610 --> 24:05.694
Let's do it.

24:05.777 --> 24:06.987
Wait, what?

24:09.656 --> 24:12.283
Um, actually,
this was all my idea and I'm back in.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.040
-You serious?
-Yeah.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.713
Maybe two generations from now,
they'll look back on this moment

24:24.796 --> 24:27.382
and say that's why
there's still an Iron River Ranch.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.055
That's exactly what they're gonna say.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.350
Or it doesn't matter what we do...

24:38.393 --> 24:41.312
'cause by then we'll all be
speaking fucking Chinese.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.236
All right. Here's to expanding
the Iron River Ranch.

24:48.319 --> 24:49.320
[chuckles] Yeah.

24:49.404 --> 24:52.073
Where the grass is green, the sky is blue

24:52.157 --> 24:54.910
and the only fat girls are the ones
who say "moo." [chuckles]

24:58.288 --> 25:01.082
Sorry, I've had that since,
like, the seventh grade.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.169
Yeah, you've been single since then, too.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.424
-I'm so happy for you guys.
-[chuckles] Cheers.

25:10.759 --> 25:14.220
We should celebrate. A toast, perhaps?

25:16.472 --> 25:20.727
So, Rooster, Colt told me
that you're seeing Engineer Jen?

25:20.811 --> 25:23.521
Or was he just meaning in the bushes
outside her hotel room?

25:23.605 --> 25:24.856
[Colt snorts]

25:27.150 --> 25:30.779
Nah, she's getting too clingy.
Trying to keep my distance.

25:32.656 --> 25:36.534
That meaning that the court order says
you can't come within 500 feet of her?

25:36.618 --> 25:38.161
[all laugh]

25:39.705 --> 25:41.039
You know what your problem is?

25:41.122 --> 25:42.958
[clears throat] You don't know
how to treat a woman.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.086
-You've gotta treat her with class.
-Mmm...

25:46.169 --> 25:47.713
Refinement.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.047
Now if you'll excuse me,

25:49.130 --> 25:52.133
I'm gonna go pee my lady's initials
into the urinal ice.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.435
I have a master's degree.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.899
Yeah... [sighs]
Engineer Jen's pretty into me.

26:08.524 --> 26:11.236
I mean, I'm not even returning
her calls or her texts

26:11.319 --> 26:15.073
or any other badass things she does
trying to get my attention.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.870
So, like, you know,
what kind of advice would you give her?

26:19.953 --> 26:21.329
I'd tell her to move on.

26:21.412 --> 26:22.789
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.752
So, uh, what else you got?

26:26.835 --> 26:29.713
Look, the reason why Colt and I work
is 'cause we're best friends.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.465
We hang out together.
We laugh, we talk.

26:32.548 --> 26:34.926
You know, just take the pressure
off the relationship part

26:35.010 --> 26:36.344
and just be Jen's friend.

26:36.427 --> 26:37.721
Right.

26:37.804 --> 26:41.474
So, like... treat her like a dude?

26:43.434 --> 26:46.187
I was thinking more
like a person, but yeah.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.868
You here to protest me chopping wood?

26:59.951 --> 27:03.538
No, but I do have some poster board
and markers in my car.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.498
I could whip something up, I guess.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.835
Why are you here, Maggie?

27:08.919 --> 27:12.964
[sighs] I wanted a grumpy old man
to yell at me and my dad's dead,

27:13.048 --> 27:14.174
so I came here.

27:15.759 --> 27:19.429
I figured you'd be pissed,
so we'd need to have this out.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.223
We don't.
Thanks for stopping by.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.642
It's not that simple, Beau.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.478
We live in the same small town.
We have sons together.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.230
You can have 'em.

27:31.983 --> 27:36.154
Colt's getting married. I don't wanna
have this fight at that reception.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.824
Your cousin Joe's wedding
was already on  Cops.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.618
Okay. Go ahead and apologize.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.412
For what?

27:44.495 --> 27:47.498
You know what the pipeline money
means to this ranch.

27:48.374 --> 27:49.793
Find another cause.

27:50.961 --> 27:54.339
I'm sure there's some
endangered owl somewhere

27:54.422 --> 27:58.593
who's being persecuted
for his alternative lifestyle.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.596
You can make your little jokes.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.265
I'm not gonna back down
from something I believe in

28:04.349 --> 28:05.976
because you're going to pout about it.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.062
I included you in a family decision...

28:09.896 --> 28:11.564
even though you left this family.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.694
You had a vote, you lost.
Now you won't accept it.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.780
You sound like a damn Democrat.

28:22.242 --> 28:24.995
Would you get over yourself?
It wasn't personal.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.414
What's more personal
than betraying your family?

28:28.498 --> 28:32.878
Can we just disagree without it being
me betraying the family?

28:35.088 --> 28:36.547
Maggie, I'm tired.

28:37.924 --> 28:42.804
When I see you at the wedding,
I'll tip my hat, I'll smile.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.641
I'll even help you wrangle
Rooster's drunk ass

28:46.725 --> 28:50.729
after he takes off his shirt
and starts singing "Sweet Home Alabama."

28:52.355 --> 28:56.735
As far as I'm concerned,
you are no longer welcome on this ranch.

28:59.821 --> 29:00.822
Wow.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.408
I can't believe you just said that.

29:04.785 --> 29:08.121
Don't worry, Beau.
I won't be back anytime soon.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.923
-Hey, Rooster.
-Hey. Engineer Jen, what's up?

29:18.006 --> 29:19.007
What are you doin'?

29:19.090 --> 29:22.928
Well, I'm just, uh,
fucking with Colt's Xbox controller.

29:23.011 --> 29:26.472
Switching the "X" button for a "B"
and the "Y" button for an "A."

29:26.556 --> 29:28.224
That way, whenever he needs
to make a spin move,

29:28.308 --> 29:29.935
he's gonna be doing a speed burst.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.521
I guarantee he's gonna cry like a bitch.

29:35.231 --> 29:38.026
Cool. You're in your mid-30s, right?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.488
[chuckles] What brings you by?

29:43.073 --> 29:44.574
Well, the surveyors are all done,

29:44.657 --> 29:47.077
so I just wanted to drop off
the gate keys.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.288
Oh, okay. I'll tell Dad
you dropped 'em off.

29:51.998 --> 29:55.126
[sighs] So, those protesters
still giving you a headache?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.462
Yeah. What's the cure? Sex with you?

29:59.798 --> 30:03.093
No, although,
I did have a wrestling coach one time

30:03.176 --> 30:05.678
who said he could cure headaches
with a back rub.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.388
He couldn't.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.311
Actually, I was just honestly curious
how your job was going.

30:14.229 --> 30:19.400
Well, the protesters found out who I am
and keyed my truck.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.403
As far as my boss knows,
they also backed it into a shopping cart.

30:23.363 --> 30:28.201
I get it. As far as my dad's concerned,
Colt spilled nachos on his favorite chair.

30:30.661 --> 30:31.830
This whole thing sucks.

30:32.873 --> 30:36.292
I don't wanna upset anyone.
I just want to do my job.

30:36.918 --> 30:41.464
I'm getting paid to work with rocks.
I love rocks.

30:41.547 --> 30:43.174
I still remember in the sixth grade,

30:43.258 --> 30:45.551
we took this school trip
to Washington, DC.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.803
I got to touch a moon rock.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.805
It changed my life.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.183
From that point forward,
I knew it was my calling.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.103
Well, how do you know
it was a moon rock and not, like,

30:55.186 --> 30:57.647
just some shitty rock
they found at a construction site

30:57.730 --> 30:59.315
when they tore down a strip club?

31:03.486 --> 31:04.863
Why would you do that?

31:07.615 --> 31:11.411
Sorry. Yeah. Well, that sucks
you're going through that.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.289
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

31:14.372 --> 31:16.291
I'll let you go out back,
take home one rock.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.043
They're from Mars.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.212
[laughs] Thanks.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.089
And thanks for letting me vent.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.801
Yeah, sure.
Just trying to be a good friend.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.470
And that's what we'll be
from now on, all right?

31:29.554 --> 31:30.763
No matter what happened in the past.

31:30.846 --> 31:32.640
I appreciate that.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.517
-Unless, of course you wanna go inside--
-Nope.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.020
-Cool. Yeah, me neither. [grunts]
-See you, Rooster.

31:37.603 --> 31:38.688
All right. See you later.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.652
[imitating Abby] "Just be her friend."

31:44.735 --> 31:45.861
[in normal voice] Fuck you, Abby.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.495
Dad? Close call at the feed store.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.998
Almost let it slip that you drink wine.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.499
[chuckles]

31:58.583 --> 32:00.835
It'd be horrible if that got out,
you know?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.588
'Course, it'd be harder for me
to say something

32:03.671 --> 32:06.216
if my mouth was filled
with homemade pizza.

32:11.554 --> 32:12.722
[sighs]

32:12.805 --> 32:14.015
You okay?

32:14.975 --> 32:15.976
Yeah.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.937
Just catching my breath.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.771
You want me to help you chop that wood?

32:23.066 --> 32:26.652
Dad? Dad? Dad?

32:28.696 --> 32:30.698
[country music playing]
