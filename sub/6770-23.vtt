WEBVTT

00:03.737 --> 00:07.107
The whole idea of this thing
just makes me really nervous.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.042
I've already created
the site, Donna.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.678
Well, we haven't even taken
the pictures of my clothes yet.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.413
They'll be ready tomorrow.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.448
And then we have to choose
which ones we like,

00:15.515 --> 00:16.549
if there are any, which I doubt.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.785
They'll look great.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.019
Then you still have
to put them on the site.

00:20.086 --> 00:23.490
And then, Miss Defeatist, with
a simple click of the mouse,

00:23.556 --> 00:26.326
DonnaMartinOriginals.com will
officially be up and running.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.527
How can you be so calm?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.763
We have less than 24 hours
to get this done.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.332
(sighs) Maybe we should
postpone it a week.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.369
Open it.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.774
Thank you.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.413
MITCH:
It's just like mine.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.081
I even set it up for you.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.083
You shouldn't have.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.584
Can't help it; I'm type A.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.520
Now, check out the calendar.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.357
DONNA:
"Next Wednesday,

00:57.424 --> 00:59.159
movie with Mitch at 8:00."

00:59.225 --> 01:00.827
MITCH: And on Saturday,
we're rollerblading.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.730
See, our schedules
mesh perfectly.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.665
I don't think
that's just a coincidence.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.133
No, just a reminder

01:07.200 --> 01:08.368
that I haven't had a vacation
since college.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.436
(laughs)

01:10.837 --> 01:12.672
Look,

01:12.739 --> 01:15.074
I know we've only dated
a couple times,

01:15.141 --> 01:18.812
but I just wanted you to know
I am officially off the market.

01:22.682 --> 01:23.850
No response necessary.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.519
(chuckles)

01:30.690 --> 01:32.692
(sighs) You're never going
to believe who that was.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.860
The Doheny Mansion?

01:33.927 --> 01:34.861
They just got a cancellation,

01:34.928 --> 01:36.629
and we can have
our wedding reception there?

01:36.696 --> 01:38.631
No, my dad.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.735
Your dad? Wow.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.704
You haven't talked
to him in months.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.706
Mm, I haven't seen him
in, like, two years.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.308
But he's coming into town

01:48.374 --> 01:51.744
and he wants to have dinner
tomorrow night, with us.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.280
With us?

01:54.347 --> 01:55.782
Mm-hmm.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.717
Am I being inspected?

01:57.784 --> 01:58.818
(chuckles)
I certainly hope so.

01:58.885 --> 01:59.819
(Matt chuckles)

01:59.886 --> 02:02.689
I can't wait to show you off.

02:02.755 --> 02:06.593
Dads always disapprove
of their daughter's fiancés.

02:06.659 --> 02:07.760
It's in the job description.

02:07.827 --> 02:11.231
Bill Taylor is
a convicted embezzler,

02:11.297 --> 02:15.735
a world-class philanderer, and
a completely negligent father.

02:15.802 --> 02:19.472
You are honest and faithful
and totally dependable.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.341
If anybody should be worried,
it should be him.

02:21.407 --> 02:25.311
You know, they, uh,
they say a lot of times

02:25.378 --> 02:28.681
that daughters end up marrying
men just like their fathers.

02:28.748 --> 02:31.551
Yeah, I've heard that before.

02:31.618 --> 02:34.521
Which is why I am doing
the exact opposite.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.490
I am marrying a man
I completely trust.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.826
I am marrying you.

eToys, E*TRADE, eBay.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.994
e-God!

04:21.060 --> 04:23.896
We're missing out on the
gold rush of the new millennium.

04:23.963 --> 04:24.931
That's nice.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.099
Honey, people are making

04:26.165 --> 04:29.369
a fortune on these Internet
stocks-- everybody but us.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.504
Well, compare
and despair, honey.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.007
You know, Donna's taking
her store online.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.775
Yeah, with Dylan backing her,
right?

04:35.842 --> 04:37.644
Yeah. Well, that should tell you
something right there.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.811
The rich get richer.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.880
I bet he'd cut us in
if we asked him.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.949
We can't afford that, Steve.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.419
You know, when Bill Gates
was starting out,

04:46.486 --> 04:48.054
he went to his neighbor
for a loan.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.657
$800 for five percent
of the company.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.991
Do you have any idea how much

04:52.058 --> 04:53.593
five percent of Microsoft
is worth?

04:54.861 --> 04:55.928
Like, a jillion
and a half dollars.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.697
(sighs)
If it was just the two of us,

04:57.764 --> 04:59.666
Steve, I would consider it,
but it's not.

04:59.732 --> 05:00.933
We have Maddy now,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.670
which means nannies
and Mommy and Me classes

05:03.736 --> 05:05.638
and Gymboree and preschool.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.539
Do you have any idea

05:06.606 --> 05:08.307
how expensive preschool is
these days?

05:08.374 --> 05:10.510
Well, yeah,
but if DonnaMartinOriginals.com

05:10.576 --> 05:12.812
takes off, we could be rich.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.814
And if it doesn't?

05:14.881 --> 05:17.850
The answer is no, Steve--
not with our money.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.636
This is a disaster,
just as predicted.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.804
I called the agency.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.806
They said the model should
have been here an hour ago.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.374
She'll show.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.742
I wouldn't bet on it.

05:42.809 --> 05:46.612
Photographer is costing
$1,000 an hour.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.747
(sighs)

05:47.814 --> 05:48.848
MAN:
Sign here and here.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.550
You're officially a corporation.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.851
(Dylan sighs)

05:51.918 --> 05:54.487
So that means that I'm not held
personally liable

05:54.554 --> 05:55.588
if this thing tanks.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.890
And don't forget
about the beauty part.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.525
Everything is written off
as a business expense.

05:59.592 --> 06:00.827
Right.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.862
Hey, so what is the, uh, story
with the blonde?

06:02.929 --> 06:04.831
DYLAN:
Camille?

06:04.897 --> 06:06.365
ACCOUNTANT:
Yeah.

06:06.432 --> 06:07.800
Models are my specialty.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.368
Not this one.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.637
She's taken.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.676
While we got time, you want
to HotSync our schedules?

06:16.743 --> 06:18.611
No, no, I-I don't.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.613
Got a few more dates
set up for us.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.814
Mitch, did you know

06:21.881 --> 06:25.685
that DonnaMartinOriginals.com
is doomed?

06:25.752 --> 06:26.786
Doomed.

06:26.853 --> 06:27.887
Hope you're not busy Christmas.

06:27.954 --> 06:28.888
Christmas?

06:28.955 --> 06:29.889
It's premature, I know.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.124
It's eight months away.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.759
I like to know what I'm doing,

06:32.825 --> 06:35.161
so I have something
to look forward to.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.830
DONNA (sighs): Dylan, the
model's not showing up, so...

06:37.897 --> 06:38.631
we should just cut our losses

06:38.698 --> 06:40.733
and forget
about the whole thing.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.802
Uh, my accountant, who's not
really much of a brain surgeon,

06:42.869 --> 06:44.837
had <i> a</i> good idea.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.707
Camille should be the model.

06:48.941 --> 06:50.843
-Pardon me?
-DONNA: That is a great idea.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.712
Camille, will you put on
the red dress?

06:52.779 --> 06:54.647
Uh, and could you do it quickly?
'Cause I'm not gonna

06:54.714 --> 06:56.182
stand around here all day
wasting money.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.884
Camille isn't a model.

06:57.950 --> 07:01.120
Hey, I want us
to be online by tomorrow.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.090
Camille?

07:04.857 --> 07:07.160
Yes.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.432
You're not eye candy;
you're a businesswoman.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.767
Exactly.

07:14.834 --> 07:18.037
I'm a businesswoman,
and this is a business decision.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.942
Relax, David.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.511
Dylan, last time I checked,
I wasn't on your payroll.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.953
(indistinct chatter,
tools whirring)

07:39.959 --> 07:41.894
NOAH: I'll tell you,
the party tomorrow night

07:41.961 --> 07:43.729
for DonnaMartinOriginals.com
is going to be

07:43.796 --> 07:45.932
like the ball dropping
at Times Square, you know?

07:45.998 --> 07:46.933
Mm-hmm.

07:46.999 --> 07:47.934
I mean, that-that minus

07:48.000 --> 07:48.868
a couple hundred thousand
people, of course.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.103
I know, it's going
to be a huge success.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.672
Yep.

07:52.738 --> 07:53.873
If I had some spare cash, man...

07:53.940 --> 07:54.874
You'd invest.

07:54.941 --> 07:55.942
Uh-huh.

07:56.008 --> 07:58.477
Know what they say
about people who used to be rich

07:58.544 --> 08:00.179
not missing their money?

08:00.246 --> 08:02.648
It's a crock, okay?

08:02.715 --> 08:05.718
If I cashed in on the Net,
I'd buy a 32-foot sloop

08:05.785 --> 08:09.622
and just sail off to Tahiti,
you know?

08:09.689 --> 08:11.557
Yeah. How about you?

08:11.624 --> 08:13.659
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.862
(sighs)
I'd stop waking up at 2:00 a.m.

08:15.928 --> 08:19.031
with nightmares
about not having enough cash.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.034
I would never, ever go
to Bakersfield again to cover

08:22.101 --> 08:23.970
another one of those
stupid UFO conventions.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.037
(Noah laughs)

08:26.072 --> 08:28.708
Yeah, well, we can always dream.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.142
Yeah, right.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.211
(phone rings)

08:34.780 --> 08:35.881
Yeah.

08:35.948 --> 08:36.982
It's Ellen.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.851
Hey.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.852
I-I didn't think
I'd be hearing from you.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.655
Yeah, I wanted
to hear your voice.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.757
How are you?

08:44.824 --> 08:45.892
NOAH:
I'm fine.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.026
The question is: how are you?

08:47.093 --> 08:49.962
Uh, well,
I'm actually not so good.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.797
Um, I could kind of
use your help.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.932
(Noah chuckles)

08:52.999 --> 08:54.800
NOAH: I thought that's exactly
what you didn't want.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.203
I'm in jail, Noah.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.206
Please get me out of here.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.611
DONNA:
<i>You should have seen David.</i>

09:05.678 --> 09:07.947
He was a jerk
during the whole photo shoot.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.949
Just because Camille
was modeling?

09:10.016 --> 09:11.951
I don't know
what his problem is.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.886
And then there's Mitch.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.288
What about him?

09:15.354 --> 09:17.223
Well, Mitch has me scheduled
to spend every vacation

09:17.290 --> 09:19.759
with him and his family
from now until Groundhog's Day.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.127
(both chuckle)

09:21.193 --> 09:23.596
You being down on Mitch
wouldn't have anything to do

09:23.663 --> 09:26.098
with the fact that David and
Camille are fighting, would it?

09:26.165 --> 09:28.668
No.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.671
Why would you even ask that?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.105
You just always get
really critical

09:33.172 --> 09:34.307
of whoever you're going out with

09:34.373 --> 09:38.277
the minute the specter of David
as a single man comes up.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.146
Hmm. Purple purse!

09:40.212 --> 09:42.281
Definitely go with
the purple purse.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.883
Nice change of subject.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.052
-Oh, caught me.
-(both chuckle)

09:46.118 --> 09:48.888
So, uh, are you nervous about
introducing Matt to your dad?

09:48.955 --> 09:50.957
-Hmm.
-(phone rings)

09:51.023 --> 09:53.926
Hold on.

09:53.993 --> 09:55.127
Hello.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.128
Hi, Dad.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.064
No.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.933
-(over phone): Sorry. -Uh...
no, I understand, of course.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.835
Maybe the next time
you come into town.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.807
Yeah.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.909
(phone beeps)

10:11.877 --> 10:13.112
-Thank you.
-Hey.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.214
Hi-- wow, hey, Maddy.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.315
You come for a BLT?

10:16.382 --> 10:17.550
Say hi.

10:17.616 --> 10:20.720
No, actually, Maddy doesn't have
enough teeth for a BLT yet,

10:20.786 --> 10:22.121
but I certainly am capable.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.790
Oh, well, okay, s-see,
I saw two on the bottom.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.092
-(Janet chuckles)
-I thought she could do that.

10:26.158 --> 10:26.993
You know, I wanted to talk

10:27.059 --> 10:29.028
to you and Steve
about something anyway.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.930
Oh, he's in Bakersfield
for the night.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.765
Oh, well,
that explains the wire.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.667
-What wire?
-He wired $10,000

10:34.734 --> 10:36.302
into my account
a couple of hours ago.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.839
Right, the $10,000.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.108
Yeah, I invested it in Donna's
Web site like Steve wanted,

10:42.174 --> 10:44.176
but I want to make sure
that you guys know

10:44.243 --> 10:45.811
that this is kind of risky.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.214
As a matter of fact,
we discussed that at length.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.415
Well, good,
'cause you know Steve.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.918
He only sees the dollar signs,
not the possible downside.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.088
But, anyway, you ladies have
a nice dinner, and I'll see you.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.089
Mm.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.358
Um, say hi to Steve for me.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.962
Oh, believe me, I will.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.930
(Madeline fussing)

11:04.997 --> 11:06.365
What?

11:06.432 --> 11:07.967
I know.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.869
MATT:
<i>I appreciate you</i>

11:09.935 --> 11:12.071
coming to me, Tom,
but I'm not taking on

11:12.138 --> 11:13.939
-any new cases right now.
-Oh, well.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.008
(chuckles)
I thought anybody handing out

11:16.075 --> 11:19.178
business cards at a rave
would be hard up for clients.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.016
Here's the name and number
of an excellent lawyer.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.985
I'm sure he can help you out.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.086
Okay.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.855
TOM:
I'll say hi

11:29.922 --> 11:32.391
-to Amy for you.
-Uh, yeah, you do that.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.859
Hey.

11:33.926 --> 11:35.361
Hi.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.929
Who was that?

11:36.996 --> 11:38.864
Uh, just some guy
looking for a lawyer.

11:38.931 --> 11:39.899
Are you gonna take the case?

11:39.965 --> 11:41.033
Unwinnable.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.804
So... what's the story?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.906
Where are we going
for dinner tonight?

11:46.972 --> 11:49.809
We're not; my dad called
and canceled again.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.877
You all right?

11:51.944 --> 11:53.212
Yeah. Fine.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.914
I'm just a little angry.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.751
At myself, mostly,
for getting all... excited.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.753
I feel like an idiot.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.488
Hey.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.391
He's a fool; it's his loss.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.792
Mmm.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.794
(Kelly chuckles)

12:08.861 --> 12:11.230
Thank you.

12:11.297 --> 12:12.932
For what?

12:12.998 --> 12:13.966
(sighs)

12:14.033 --> 12:15.901
For never disappointing me.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.838
I'm taking you out tonight.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.872
Okay?

12:19.939 --> 12:21.507
Oh, there's one problem
with that.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.075
-Hmm?
-Who's Amy?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.947
Amy? Um... (chuckles)
She's just some girl

12:28.013 --> 12:29.815
that Dylan hooked up with
at the desert.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.851
That's how that guy
heard about me.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.819
Ugh. Dylan is such a dog.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.801
NOAH:
<i>Did you sleep at all?</i>

12:48.868 --> 12:51.070
Yeah. I guess.

12:51.137 --> 12:53.005
Mm.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.408
(Noah exhales)

12:56.475 --> 12:58.444
You know what?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.980
Why don't we hold off
on the job hunt,

13:01.046 --> 13:03.015
just for now.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.385
Do you want to talk about

13:06.452 --> 13:08.921
why the cops found you
passed out in your car?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.428
Well, I was, um,
behind on my rent,

13:16.495 --> 13:20.266
so I just moved everything
into my trunk.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.835
I was embarrassed.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.803
You don't have to be
embarrassed, okay?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.038
You can call me.

13:26.105 --> 13:29.942
I thought about it,
but I just couldn't.

13:31.377 --> 13:34.513
And then yesterday,
my car wouldn't start.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.816
(sighs) And I just said
the hell with it, you know?

13:37.883 --> 13:41.453
I had a half gallon of Gilbey's
and I just started in.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.823
And the next thing I know,

13:44.890 --> 13:48.027
there's a cop knocking
on my windshield.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.499
(voice breaks):
I'm so scared.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.501
I know.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.903
Look, I know you're scared.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.607
Let's get you back in AA.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.042
Noah, please!

14:03.108 --> 14:04.977
Okay? I need a job.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.012
Look, I know you need a job,
but you need help.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.927
And now I just press "beam,"
and bingo,

14:21.994 --> 14:23.395
I've just sent you
my schedule for the day.

14:23.462 --> 14:26.398
Now, if you want, you can...
beam me your itinerary.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.567
What is it?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.603
I don't want to beam you
my itinerary.

14:30.669 --> 14:34.106
But in terms of time management,
it's a real sweetheart.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.341
I'm sure it is.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.009
I...

14:37.076 --> 14:38.911
I can't do this.

14:38.978 --> 14:42.147
What are you saying,
you don't like me?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.283
Oh, I do, I...

14:44.350 --> 14:45.651
I don't know.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.087
Just, there's something
missing here for me.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.422
I mean, what about spontaneity?

14:50.489 --> 14:52.424
What about not knowing
what's gonna happen next?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.460
But I know what <i> I</i> want
to have happen next.

14:54.526 --> 14:56.161
Yeah, but don't you think
mapping things out

14:56.228 --> 14:58.530
kind of sucks the fun out of
getting to know each other?

14:58.597 --> 15:01.133
A well-crafted plan,
making it happen-- that's fun.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.002
Well, I can appreciate
that in business,

15:03.068 --> 15:04.169
but not with people.

15:05.271 --> 15:06.939
Not with me.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.941
(sighs)
So, from now on,

15:09.008 --> 15:12.244
I think we should just
keep things professional, okay?

15:14.713 --> 15:16.915
Okay, then.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.652
Here are the pictures
from the shoot.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.687
I scanned them all.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.155
Page me later and let me know

15:23.222 --> 15:24.456
which ones you
want me to upload.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.392
Um, Mitch, I...

15:26.458 --> 15:29.194
hope this isn't gonna
affect us working together,

15:29.261 --> 15:32.197
because tonight-- a lot
of planning's gone into it.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.433
Um, I've decided
not to go to the party.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.635
Chalk one up for spontaneity.

15:36.702 --> 15:40.639
But don't worry, your site'll be
online, 8:00 sharp, as planned.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.978
I just want you
to know, Donna...

15:46.045 --> 15:48.047
I don't give up that easily.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.021
(sighs)

15:57.056 --> 15:58.457
-Dylan.
-Mitch.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.459
So, enough about me.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.462
You have 30 seconds
to update me on your life.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.999
I can do it in ten seconds;
my life's pretty boring.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.701
Oh, really?
What about Amy?

16:08.767 --> 16:10.369
Yes, I know all about

16:10.436 --> 16:13.539
your liaison with
the desert princess, thank you.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.074
Yeah, well, Amy was a nice girl.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.609
She, uh-- but it was
never meant to be.

16:17.676 --> 16:18.677
Okay, come on, we're late.

16:18.744 --> 16:20.512
Okay.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.448
-And where are you two going?
-We're, um,

16:22.514 --> 16:24.583
-looking at some wedding sites?
-Yeah, and we're late.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.751
You said that.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.687
(chuckles):
Oh...

16:28.754 --> 16:29.655
Have a nice day.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.132
I'm back!

16:40.199 --> 16:42.000
Huh! Oh, boy!

16:42.067 --> 16:43.569
Hi, honey.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.571
Hey, Maddy!
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm!

16:45.637 --> 16:47.706
Did you two ladies have
the Chippendale dancers

16:47.773 --> 16:50.042
come over while Daddy was
away at his convention?

16:50.109 --> 16:51.143
-Huh?
-(Madeline fussing)

16:51.210 --> 16:52.644
Oh, honey,

16:52.711 --> 16:56.181
for the last 13 hours,
I've been surrounded by people

16:56.248 --> 16:58.250
who swear that they've
had their nether regions

16:58.317 --> 16:59.351
probed by aliens.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.488
Speaking of probing
nether regions, nice to see ya.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.124
What? What's wrong?
You want to tell me?

17:05.190 --> 17:07.526
I thought we agreed not
to invest in Donna's business.

17:07.593 --> 17:08.761
I know.

17:08.827 --> 17:09.661
I talked to Dylan.

17:09.728 --> 17:10.762
-Oh, boy.
-I can't believe

17:10.829 --> 17:11.797
you went through with it.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.132
Well, it was a good investment.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.067
That's not the point, Steve.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.536
There are larger issues
at stake here.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.771
Do you have any idea
about partnership?

17:19.838 --> 17:20.672
Yes, I understand partnership!

17:20.739 --> 17:22.741
And I want our partnership
to flourish,

17:22.808 --> 17:25.477
which is why I didn't
invest <i> our</i> money!

17:25.544 --> 17:26.779
I invested <i> my</i> money.

17:26.845 --> 17:29.181
-Your money?
-Yeah. Grandpa Sanders--

17:29.248 --> 17:31.316
rest his soul-- when he died,
he left me $50,000.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.452
I've had it in a trust fund.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.453
-Your money?
-Yeah!

17:34.520 --> 17:36.188
So no harm, no foul.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.423
Our money's still
safe and sound,

17:37.489 --> 17:39.825
racking up
four percent annually.

17:43.429 --> 17:44.430
What?! What's wrong now?

17:44.496 --> 17:45.664
Oh, nothing.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.534
Just... I didn't know
that you had $50,000

17:48.600 --> 17:50.469
in a bank account, that's all.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.838
Well, I was gonna tell you;
I guess I forgot.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.907
Right.

17:54.973 --> 17:57.810
Oh, jeez! I just told you
I had $50,000 stashed away.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.845
You think you'd be
a little happier about it.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.581
Oh, I am.
I'm so <i> happy</i> for you

18:02.648 --> 18:05.484
and all your money!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.488
(sighs)

18:11.790 --> 18:12.724
(Ellen sighs)

18:12.791 --> 18:13.792
I hate these meetings.

18:13.859 --> 18:16.261
Yeah, I used to, too.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.765
(sighs) It's not like I haven't
given AA a chance, you know?

18:19.832 --> 18:23.202
It's just that I'm not into
the whole group mentality thing.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.137
Yeah, well, going in there
is one thing;

18:25.204 --> 18:27.339
admitting you have a problem,
working through the steps--

18:27.406 --> 18:28.507
that's another.

18:28.574 --> 18:29.741
Noah, I'm not saying

18:29.808 --> 18:31.777
that it doesn't work
for some people.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.246
(laughs): Okay,
like you're so much different.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.182
Come on.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.618
Look, I'm not gonna force you
to go in there, okay?

18:39.685 --> 18:41.620
You have to do it on your own.

18:43.822 --> 18:44.823
(sighs)

18:44.890 --> 18:46.792
I can't.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.467
Yeah, I like the way you can see
this fur in the picture.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.536
There's two different poses.

18:59.671 --> 19:00.839
Hi.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.241
Hey.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.408
What a nice surprise.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.444
I'm, uh, here to pick up

19:05.511 --> 19:06.845
the banners for the party.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.581
Well, you have to check
these out; they were great.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.822
Yeah, they're nice.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.857
So, where are they?

19:18.924 --> 19:20.526
DONNA:
Nice? Are you kidding?

19:20.592 --> 19:22.194
Camille's gonna be
the next Cindy Margolis.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.662
(laughs)
Donna.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.863
DONNA:
They're beautiful.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.665
Oh, wait, wait.
Here, check this one out.

19:26.732 --> 19:29.434
-Who's Cindy Margolis?
-She's an Internet model,

19:29.501 --> 19:30.669
but that's beside the point.

19:30.736 --> 19:31.837
You don't like them, right?

19:31.904 --> 19:34.840
No, they're-they're nice.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.175
Yeah, I mean, you know,
lighting's a little cheesy,

19:37.242 --> 19:38.911
but... who am I to say?

19:38.977 --> 19:40.512
Banners are over there.

19:43.916 --> 19:44.850
(quietly):
Cheesy?

19:46.652 --> 19:47.653
See ya.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.890
David, what the hell
is going on with you?

19:51.957 --> 19:53.825
Nothing. You asked for my
opinion and I gave it to you.

19:53.892 --> 19:55.294
Does this have anything
to do with Dylan?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.762
No, Camille, it has
nothing to do with Dylan.

19:56.828 --> 19:57.563
Because it's getting really old.

19:57.629 --> 19:58.830
All right, then
explain it to me.

19:58.897 --> 19:59.665
-What is it?
-Explain what?

19:59.731 --> 20:01.633
Why the better things
get for us,

20:01.700 --> 20:03.735
-the more miserable you seem
to become. -Oh, maybe

20:03.802 --> 20:05.203
I'm just a miserable guy.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.805
I don't like to be around that.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.206
Don't, then!

20:19.952 --> 20:21.920
NOAH:
<i>It just hurts, you know?</i>

20:21.987 --> 20:25.223
I see so much of myself
in Ellen.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.427
(sighs) I just, I just
never realized that-that-that...

20:28.493 --> 20:31.330
drinking was
taking over my life.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.466
I'm just glad I have
all you people to lean on.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.801
Thanks, Noah.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.870
Uh, before we close,

20:38.937 --> 20:40.872
we'd like to acknowledge
any newcomers

20:40.939 --> 20:43.342
and encourage them
to keep coming back.

20:45.043 --> 20:48.847
Hi. I'm Mike,
and I'm an alcoholic.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.583
OTHERS:
Hi, Mike.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.754
I'm Ellen,
and I'm an alcoholic.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.589
OTHERS:
Hi, Ellen.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.300
(rock music playing)

21:16.775 --> 21:18.010
STEVE (chuckles):
Oh, boy.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.845
Hey, all systems are a go.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.481
I'm just a point and click away
from pay dirt.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.849
Hey, where's Janet tonight?

21:23.915 --> 21:26.718
Uh, Janet's not really ready
for the Internet age.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.719
(Donna sighs)

21:27.786 --> 21:29.721
I don't think I am, either.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.857
-STEVE: Oh, boy.
-Oh, I'm so nervous!

21:31.923 --> 21:34.326
Anyway, it's almost time;
there's no going back.

21:34.393 --> 21:35.360
(groans):
Oh...

21:35.427 --> 21:36.862
-I'll get you a drink.
-Mm-hmm.

21:36.928 --> 21:38.930
-You want something?
-Uh, no.

21:47.105 --> 21:49.608
Why were you and Kelly
talking about Amy this morning?

21:49.675 --> 21:50.909
It was a fluke.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.745
She asked, I lied, it's over.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.746
Okay, yeah, well,
just don't offer up

21:54.813 --> 21:55.814
any more information, okay?

21:55.881 --> 21:57.749
We got to keep our stories
straight here, remember?

21:57.816 --> 22:00.519
Hey, nervous guy,
why don't you just come clean?

22:00.585 --> 22:01.586
(chuckles):
Nervous guy?

22:01.653 --> 22:02.854
Yeah, right.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.890
Listen, I know
you're enjoying the fact that

22:04.956 --> 22:07.793
I made a mistake,
but spare me the good advice.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.765
I don't know
what's up with David.

22:13.832 --> 22:14.900
Everything was going so well.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.568
Well, don't worry.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.503
David gets in his little moods.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.872
You know what?
Maybe it's my fault.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.841
No. No, no, no. Trust me.

22:22.908 --> 22:23.875
It'll blow over.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.677
Just-Just give him some space.

22:25.744 --> 22:26.712
(Camille sighs)

22:26.778 --> 22:27.946
Thanks.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.448
Oh, you're welcome.

22:29.514 --> 22:30.716
Here you go, hon.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.751
Oh, thank you.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.053
DYLAN:
Excuse me.

22:37.789 --> 22:40.692
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, can
I have your attention, please?

22:40.759 --> 22:42.060
By my estimation,

22:42.127 --> 22:44.963
it's about 30 seconds--
DonnaMartinOriginals.com

22:45.030 --> 22:46.431
will be coming online.

22:46.498 --> 22:49.000
So, without further ado,
Donna Martin.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.936
(cheering, applause)

22:51.002 --> 22:52.537
(Camille whoops)

22:53.905 --> 22:56.541
Can we have a drumroll, please?

22:56.608 --> 22:58.143
-(drumroll)
-Thank you.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.412
(cheering, whooping
and whistling)

23:09.621 --> 23:11.123
(computer trilling)

23:12.958 --> 23:13.792
(rim shot)

23:13.859 --> 23:15.894
(cheering, applause)

23:18.029 --> 23:21.800
Steve, if you'll do the honor
of a double click.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.735
My pleasure.

23:23.802 --> 23:26.004
-(electronic clack)
-MAN: No way.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.839
(crowd murmuring)

23:43.889 --> 23:45.624
What does this mean?

23:45.690 --> 23:48.193
It means we're screwed.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.444
Hey.

24:06.511 --> 24:07.746
Oh.

24:07.813 --> 24:08.780
Freezing the Web site?

24:08.847 --> 24:10.816
Was that a bad attempt at humor?

24:10.882 --> 24:12.551
More like a romantic plea.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.785
Well, that was just stupid.

24:13.852 --> 24:14.753
Why can't you see it?

24:14.820 --> 24:15.921
We're perfect for each other.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.589
Look, just because
I conveniently fit

24:17.656 --> 24:19.925
into your schedule does not mean
I'm the right girl for you.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.092
And if you would
look up from your

24:21.159 --> 24:22.360
electronic organizer long
enough, you would realize...

24:22.427 --> 24:24.863
You said you were coming over
to Mother's house for Christmas.

24:24.930 --> 24:27.566
Oh, there'll be no chestnuts
roasted between us, ever.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.768
Give me another chance.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.136
Mitch, we're done.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.904
Look, everybody's hard work,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.073
the investors' money--
all a big waste of time.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.609
Because what you did--
it wasn't romantic,

24:37.676 --> 24:38.743
it wasn't persuasive.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.112
It was cruel and destructive,
not to mention illegal.

24:41.179 --> 24:42.147
So sue me.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.816
What's a lifelong dream realized

24:44.883 --> 24:46.251
if I don't have you
to share it with, right?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.419
Are you kidding me?

24:47.485 --> 24:50.822
You know, they say there's only
one person for everyone.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.490
I was sure it was you.

24:52.557 --> 24:54.593
Yeah.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.661
Well, figuring that out--

24:56.728 --> 24:59.164
it's a lot trickier
than you would think.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.899
Guess so.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.901
(sighs)

25:02.968 --> 25:05.704
It's not too late
to make things right.

25:13.979 --> 25:14.880
(sizzling)

25:14.946 --> 25:16.848
A dot-com investment--
what was I thinking?

25:16.915 --> 25:19.084
I should have just thrown
the ten grand out the window.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.920
Well, after the disaster
last night, I'm sure glad

25:21.987 --> 25:24.589
it wasn't <i> my money,</i>
because I don't think

25:24.656 --> 25:26.157
I'd be able
to keep down my breakfast.

25:26.224 --> 25:29.527
Is it just gonna be veiled barbs
from you from now on?

25:29.594 --> 25:30.862
Oh, no.
Some won't be so veiled.

25:32.597 --> 25:35.166
Look, Maddy, here.
(gasps) Mine!

25:35.233 --> 25:36.768
Your daddy taught me that.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.904
(sighs)

25:38.970 --> 25:40.839
My grandfather was one
of the most supportive people

25:40.906 --> 25:41.940
in my life.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.775
He wanted me
to do something special

25:43.842 --> 25:45.911
with that money, and until now,
nothing seemed right.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.646
Why can't you respect that?

25:47.712 --> 25:49.748
I am not challenging the bond

25:49.814 --> 25:51.683
that you had
with your grandfather, Steve.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.753
What I don't respect
is the secrecy of the account.

25:54.819 --> 25:57.088
I wasn't hiding anything
from you.

25:57.155 --> 25:57.856
Well, you didn't mention it!

25:57.923 --> 25:59.858
-(sighs)
-And people that keep

25:59.925 --> 26:01.626
secrets have something to hide.

26:01.693 --> 26:03.061
-Like what?
-I don't know.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.663
Do you not trust me?

26:04.729 --> 26:05.797
I mean, how committed are you

26:05.864 --> 26:07.899
to this family
if you have such a huge,

26:07.966 --> 26:09.834
clandestine safety net?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.970
Hey, how could you even think
something like that?

26:12.037 --> 26:13.705
I never did.

26:13.772 --> 26:17.075
I never did until you dipped in
to your private account.

26:17.142 --> 26:20.845
And now all I can imagine
is you on some beach in Jamaica

26:20.912 --> 26:23.214
with two bimbos
and a vat of cocoa butter.

26:23.281 --> 26:24.950
Hey, I'm allergic
to cocoa butter.

26:25.016 --> 26:26.084
(Janet scoffs)

26:26.151 --> 26:27.852
What?! It's just money!

26:27.919 --> 26:30.689
That is exactly
what ticks me off.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.791
-(Steve sighs)
-Where are you going?

26:32.857 --> 26:34.292
I have dibs on the office.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.227
You and Maddy work at home.

26:36.294 --> 26:37.796
(Madeline jabbering)

26:37.862 --> 26:38.964
(door opens)

26:39.030 --> 26:40.365
Don't you look at me
like that.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.334
(door closes)

26:44.669 --> 26:46.004
Thanks.

26:47.038 --> 26:50.275
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.643
Sorry about last night.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.178
(sighs)
For which part?

26:53.244 --> 26:56.614
For blowing it off, or
the whole crash and burn of it?

26:56.681 --> 26:57.916
Kelly told me. I'm sorry.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.217
You okay?

26:59.284 --> 27:01.820
Well, I was so distracted
this morning,

27:01.886 --> 27:03.755
I accidentally dressed
a mannequin

27:03.822 --> 27:05.790
in a mock turtleneck
and a miniskirt.

27:05.857 --> 27:08.326
That's so 1997.

27:08.393 --> 27:09.494
Whatever.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.896
Should have listened to you;
you never liked the idea.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.232
No.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.801
That was more of my own
bad head trip than anything.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.771
Still, everyone stood
behind my product, so,

27:19.838 --> 27:21.306
I'm responsible.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.841
Shoulder, please.

27:22.907 --> 27:23.875
Oh.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.677
-(Donna laughs)
-I'm sorry.

27:25.744 --> 27:26.878
-Come here.
-Mmm.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.847
It was all Mitch's fault,
not yours, okay?

27:28.913 --> 27:30.248
Mm-hmm.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.317
So I assume
you're not seeing him anymore?

27:32.384 --> 27:34.786
(sighs)
I'd like to take his

27:34.853 --> 27:36.021
mouse pad and...

27:36.087 --> 27:38.023
Never mind.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.891
(both laugh)

27:39.958 --> 27:43.128
I'm glad to see
you're in a better mood.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.963
Did you make up with Camille?

27:45.030 --> 27:46.831
No, not yet.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.902
You smell good.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.370
Hmm.

27:52.437 --> 27:55.006
(both laugh gently)

27:56.908 --> 27:58.343
CAMILLE:
Hey.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.345
Where did you and Mitch go
on your date last night?

28:00.412 --> 28:01.346
What?

28:01.413 --> 28:03.148
The Web site's working.

28:03.214 --> 28:04.416
What?! We, um...

28:04.482 --> 28:05.450
We didn't go anywhere.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.786
I just stopped hating him,
like, a second ago.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.954
Whatever the little dweeb did,
it works.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.289
CAMILLE: People have been
posting messages about you.

28:11.356 --> 28:12.857
Can we talk?

28:15.760 --> 28:17.929
I'm really sorry
I missed you last night.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.764
Well, why don't we have lunch?

28:19.831 --> 28:20.932
I can't. I have a meeting

28:20.999 --> 28:22.934
with a promo spot producer
in 20 minutes.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.769
Either we're busier than ever,
or you're avoiding this.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.305
I just don't want to have a
flyby conversation, that's all.

28:29.507 --> 28:30.742
I'll call you tomorrow.

28:32.243 --> 28:33.812
Congratulations.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.013
Thank you.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.248
DYLAN:
Wow.

28:37.315 --> 28:40.318
You know, this thing's had
over 200-plus hits.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.787
This is the, uh, online store
customer message board.

28:42.854 --> 28:44.923
Oh, wait. Let me...
Let me read it.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.192
"How are the happy couple?"

28:47.258 --> 28:49.928
"Is there really a Mitch
and a Donna?" And...

28:49.994 --> 28:52.831
(giggles) "I'll buy two skirts
if you kiss him."

28:52.897 --> 28:55.233
There's got to be somewhere we
can work this to our advantage.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.935
Why do they even care?

28:57.001 --> 28:59.204
Oh, people are suckers
for a happy ending.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.775
And I'm sure
young David would agree.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.012
Hello.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.849
Hey.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.183
-(gasps)
-For your recent

29:12.250 --> 29:13.885
victory and, um,

29:13.952 --> 29:16.087
uh, the way you stood up
at the meeting, you know?

29:16.154 --> 29:17.822
-(Ellen laughs)
-I'm proud of you.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.924
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.827
Wow. It's been a long time
since somebody's given me these.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.796
(laughs)

29:24.863 --> 29:26.931
Oh. And this is for you.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.400
Thank you.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.468
Open it up.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.370
Okay.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.879
-It's blank.
-Yeah, yeah.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.082
One part of the program is, um,
listing the wrongs in your life.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.351
-What?
-Yeah. I mean,

29:46.417 --> 29:48.553
I personally found
that by writing them down...

29:48.620 --> 29:50.421
helped me deal with them,
you know?

29:52.624 --> 29:53.791
(sighs)

29:53.858 --> 29:56.995
Do you ever have a conversation
without talking about steps?

29:57.061 --> 29:58.163
(laughs)

29:58.229 --> 29:59.531
I'm sorry.

29:59.597 --> 30:00.865
It's like you're in a cult
or something.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.868
I'm-I'm not gonna write down

30:03.935 --> 30:05.403
all of my screwups
for somebody else

30:05.470 --> 30:06.571
to read and judge.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.872
That's not what it's for.

30:07.939 --> 30:09.507
You know what?
You're moving too fast,

30:09.574 --> 30:10.675
and you're asking me too much.

30:10.742 --> 30:13.945
I'm not saying right now.
I'm just saying eventually.

30:14.012 --> 30:15.246
You know, you try and just...

30:15.313 --> 30:16.948
Just try and do your best,
that's all.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.550
How can I, with you
breathing down my neck?!

30:19.617 --> 30:21.920
(sighs)

30:31.129 --> 30:36.401

30:36.467 --> 30:38.236

30:45.476 --> 30:47.412
You just don't stop, do you?

30:47.478 --> 30:49.414
What?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.216
-Ladies love Dylan McKay.
-(Kelly laughs)

30:51.282 --> 30:52.951
Pipe down, champ.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.420
What, did you forget
about Amy already?

30:55.486 --> 30:58.890
Amy wasn't exactly, uh,
girlfriend material.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.858
(laughs)
How did you guys meet again?

31:00.925 --> 31:02.927
Was it around
the infamous punch bowl?

31:02.994 --> 31:04.495
I don't really want
to talk about it,

31:04.562 --> 31:05.997
but if you want to know...

31:06.064 --> 31:06.764
MATT:
And I'll tell you.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.566
Um, see,
what happened was this.

31:08.633 --> 31:09.667
Um... (clears throat)

31:09.734 --> 31:12.370
Well, we stopped off
at this tiny little gas station

31:12.437 --> 31:14.305
that was, like,
in the middle of nowhere.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.308
And, um, Amy was working
behind the counter.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.910
And Mr. Smooth over here

31:18.977 --> 31:20.478
saunters up
with some beef jerkys.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.646
-He nods...
-Beef jerkys?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.448
Beef jerkys.
Nods to the motorcycles,

31:23.514 --> 31:25.583
and offered to give her the ride
of her life.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.651
-No, you did not.
-He did.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.286
He did, but you know
what happened?

31:28.353 --> 31:30.955
She quits her job, jumps
on the back of the motorcycle,

31:31.022 --> 31:32.457
and these two--
inseparable for two days.

31:32.523 --> 31:35.627
You know,
Donna's Web site is working.

31:35.693 --> 31:36.995
Oh. Oh, that's great.

31:37.061 --> 31:37.795
DYLAN:
She's at the store

31:37.862 --> 31:39.964
reading the customers'
responses.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.367
Oh, good. Okay, I'm gonna
go call and congratulate her.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.568
If you'll excuse me.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.169
Good-bye,
Don Juan of the desert.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.604
(Matt laughs)

31:46.671 --> 31:48.072
Sorry.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.175
(sighs):
Oh.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.011
Yeah, pretty good
for an amateur.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.345
Yeah, but listen to me.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.581
I didn't like doing that,
but I made a decision.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.949
Kelly is too important to me,

31:58.016 --> 31:59.284
and I don't want
to risk losing her.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.451
So you're gonna keep the secret?

32:00.518 --> 32:02.387
Just doing what you'd do.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.222
You're no better than me.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.257
Yeah? Well, I am still better
for her.

32:06.324 --> 32:08.359
She needs a man
that she can count on.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.395
So if you're just gonna be
waiting around, thinking

32:10.461 --> 32:12.630
that I'm gonna blow this,
you can forget about it.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.465
I underestimated you.

32:14.532 --> 32:16.601
Yeah. It's the sweater vest.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.040
I'll see you around.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.946
(exhales heavily)

32:41.359 --> 32:43.361
(gate latch clicking)

32:52.036 --> 32:52.704
You okay?

32:52.770 --> 32:55.006
I didn't drink.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.975
Good.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.246
Get your shoes on.
I want to show you something.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.324
Where's the toothpaste?

33:13.391 --> 33:15.760
Oh, I cut the tube in half.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.362
-Total disaster.
-What?

33:17.428 --> 33:20.298
It works really well
with the toilet paper, though.

33:20.365 --> 33:23.401
Oh, there's a message for you
on the machine from Dylan.

33:23.468 --> 33:25.036
Donna's Web site
is up and running.

33:25.103 --> 33:28.039
Oh. Guess I didn't
jeopardize our future.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.708
The fact you think that's why
I'm still upset, Steve,

33:30.775 --> 33:32.377
kills me.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.379
You know what, I'm getting
tired of guessing.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.047
We're a team!

33:36.114 --> 33:37.782
You don't think I value that?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.684
Not when you're keeping secrets
about money, no.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.019
It makes me think that you're
looking for an escape hatch.

33:42.086 --> 33:43.788
Yeah, for us! For us!

33:43.855 --> 33:46.057
Listen, I know this is
going to sound archaic,

33:46.124 --> 33:48.493
but taking care of you and Maddy
is my job.

33:48.559 --> 33:50.027
It's my responsibility, okay?

33:50.094 --> 33:51.529
It's not one
that I've ever faced before.

33:51.596 --> 33:52.530
Steve...

33:52.597 --> 33:55.700
Let me finish, okay?!

33:55.767 --> 33:59.170
Every day, every single day,

33:59.237 --> 34:01.239
I think about failing.

34:01.305 --> 34:02.707
I mean, what if
the paper goes down?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.609
What if, what if you
and Maddy need something

34:04.675 --> 34:05.777
that I can't provide for?

34:05.843 --> 34:09.313
That-That account was me
protecting us from my screwups!

34:13.150 --> 34:15.386
I know that's hard
for you to admit.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.722
But on our wedding day,

34:17.789 --> 34:20.591
we sealed this deal
for good times or for bad.

34:20.658 --> 34:23.494
And that's the best part about
this marriage thing, honey,

34:23.561 --> 34:25.830
is that you don't have to go
through anything alone.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.666
You don't have to keep
any secrets.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.569
Thanks.

34:31.636 --> 34:34.272
No problem.

34:34.338 --> 34:38.109
And if you're scared,
just tell me, okay?

34:39.444 --> 34:41.279
I would kiss you
so hard right now

34:41.344 --> 34:43.246
if it wasn't for
this toothpaste situation.

34:43.313 --> 34:44.315
Hmm.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.783
Under the sink.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.885
Go.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.791
DONNA:
<i>So someone placed</i>

34:53.858 --> 34:56.159
an order from Albuquerque--
my wrap skirt.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.162
From the streets
of Albuquerque.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.833
Albuquerque-- I just, I just
kind of like saying that, but...

35:01.899 --> 35:04.135
You just salted those
five seconds ago.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.572
I'm low on sodium.

35:09.574 --> 35:10.541
Camille misses you.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.776
She, um...

35:11.843 --> 35:14.579
she said that you
haven't called her.

35:14.645 --> 35:17.315
You've just always been
the type that calls.

35:17.381 --> 35:20.618
It was a trait I always
admired about you.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.787
So the two of you
were discussing this?

35:22.854 --> 35:25.790
No. I mean,
not really discussing it.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.726
It... It's just, when you're
folding dozens of T-shirts,

35:28.793 --> 35:31.596
sometimes topics
happen to come up.

35:31.662 --> 35:35.533
Like, for instance, why is David
being such a mopey butt-head.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.401
Those were her words,
not mine.

35:37.468 --> 35:40.638
I'd rather the two of you didn't
talk about it, if that's okay.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.173
Yeah.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.641
Well, it's an easy fix.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.610
Just call her and tell her
you're sorry.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.578
Check, please.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.446
(Donna chuckles softly)

35:48.513 --> 35:50.381
You know, if you keep
acting this way,

35:50.448 --> 35:52.283
you might push away
something good.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.685
Well, Donna, maybe that's
what I'm trying to do.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.362
Just let me figure it out, okay?

36:04.428 --> 36:06.764
Donna Martin.

36:06.831 --> 36:07.765
Yeah?

36:07.832 --> 36:08.933
Sheila.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.335
I recognized you
from the Web site.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.771
I just bought two skirts
and a top online this morning.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.907
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.744
I tried to log on
yesterday, honey.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.846
Guess those computer glitches
got solved,

36:21.913 --> 36:23.514
if you know what I mean.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.617
Mitch, you're even cuter
than I imagined.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.687
Good luck to you both.

36:31.822 --> 36:32.757
(chuckles)

36:32.823 --> 36:33.691
Did she just think...?

36:33.758 --> 36:35.226
Yeah.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.530
(both chuckle)

36:55.780 --> 36:56.747
(engine stops)

36:56.814 --> 36:59.584
Okay, here we are.

36:59.650 --> 37:02.320
This tops my list of things
I've done wrong.

37:03.754 --> 37:05.289
Over there.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.825
Pink jacket.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.660
(Noah laughs)

37:09.727 --> 37:11.696
(kids laughing, chattering)

37:11.762 --> 37:12.897
What's her name?

37:12.964 --> 37:14.265
Caitlin.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.933
She's six.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.835
The lady there is my mom.

37:17.902 --> 37:18.836
She takes care of her.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.339
I promised it was

37:21.405 --> 37:22.974
just until I got
my act together,

37:23.040 --> 37:26.777
but... that's taken longer
than I thought.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.883
Where's the father?

37:34.952 --> 37:37.989
Six vodka gimlets,
one one-night stand.

37:40.891 --> 37:44.662
He lives somewhere
in Chatsworth; I never told him.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.697
Catie thinks her mommy
comes in and out of her life

37:46.764 --> 37:48.332
because she works
on an airplane.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.737
What are you gonna do when
she's old enough to question

37:52.803 --> 37:54.505
that story?

37:54.572 --> 37:57.308
(sighs)

37:57.375 --> 37:58.342
Let's just go.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.910
Okay? Please?

37:59.977 --> 38:01.779
Yeah. Sure.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.948
(engine starts)

38:09.954 --> 38:10.955
(quiet knocking)

38:14.125 --> 38:15.593
Hey.

38:15.660 --> 38:16.594
Hi.

38:16.661 --> 38:17.728
You didn't get my message?

38:17.795 --> 38:19.630
I said I'd come by your place.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.799
Yeah, but I-I couldn't wait.

38:23.668 --> 38:24.502
What are you doing?

38:24.568 --> 38:26.937
Nothing.

38:27.972 --> 38:31.542
You mind if we,
uh, sit outside and talk?

38:37.148 --> 38:40.351
So you had a late night
at work, huh?

38:40.418 --> 38:41.852
Yeah.

38:41.919 --> 38:45.523
Uh, online orders
are off the charts.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.024
That's great.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.926
Yeah.

38:50.528 --> 38:52.530
You know, it's always weird

38:52.596 --> 38:55.399
the first time a couple sees
different sides of each other.

38:55.466 --> 38:56.834
Yeah.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.869
I was gonna wait
until month six

38:58.936 --> 39:03.808
before I let you see the
infamous Camille Desmond temper.

39:05.743 --> 39:06.744
Are you all right?

39:06.811 --> 39:08.846
No.

39:08.913 --> 39:09.914
(sighs)

39:09.980 --> 39:14.051
David, if I did anything
to get you in this mood...

39:14.118 --> 39:15.820
Camille, you didn't do anything.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.623
I just wanted to pick a fight.

39:20.791 --> 39:22.960
And it wasn't very cool.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.833
It's okay. Apology accepted.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.736
Let's go to dinner.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.370
You deserve better than me.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.807
David.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.076
We're solid.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.811
We'll work it out.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.847
I don't think so.

39:46.016 --> 39:48.152
You're not doing this.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.055
Why?

39:51.122 --> 39:53.157
Camille, I'm so sorry.

39:54.992 --> 39:57.128
We just don't...

39:57.194 --> 39:59.396
We don't belong together.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.104
Camille.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.575
If that was gonna be a letter,

40:11.642 --> 40:13.177
(voice breaking):
thanks for having the guts

40:13.244 --> 40:14.812
to do it in person.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.682
(gate opens, closes)

40:24.588 --> 40:26.590
(phone ringing)

40:28.626 --> 40:29.760
-Hello.
-MATT: Hey.

40:29.827 --> 40:30.928
I just ordered a half veggie,

40:30.995 --> 40:32.096
half pepperoni pizza
from Patty's.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.633
It's gonna be coming
to your place.

40:35.699 --> 40:37.535
What's that swishing around?

40:37.601 --> 40:39.103
I'm standing here
in a wedding dress.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.672
Larry, my other fiancé,
beat you to the punch.

40:41.739 --> 40:42.873
(chuckles):
Oh.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.775
Well, does Larry spring
for extra cheese?

40:44.842 --> 40:46.777
All right, he's history.

40:46.844 --> 40:47.845
Actually, it's Jackie's.

40:47.912 --> 40:50.581
She's obsessed with me
wearing it on the big day.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.783
But secretly, Donna's already
sketching some designs.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.084
Should I pick up some wine?

40:54.151 --> 40:55.786
Mm, yeah, that would be good.

40:55.853 --> 40:56.954
Okay. I love you.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.789
I love you, too. Hurry home.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.758
MATT:
Bye-bye.

41:00.825 --> 41:01.959
(phone beeps, doorbell ringing)

41:02.026 --> 41:04.628
Oh.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.864
Hold on. I'm coming.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.199
(clears throat)

41:08.265 --> 41:09.967
I just have to grab my--
your money.

41:10.034 --> 41:10.801
Oh. (chuckles)

41:10.868 --> 41:13.204
Hey. I thought
you were the pizza guy.

41:13.270 --> 41:14.738
What, are you eloping?

41:14.805 --> 41:15.940
Oh. No. It's my mom's.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.241
What do you think?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.844
Smells like mothballs.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.078
Thanks.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.513
What's up?

41:22.580 --> 41:24.515
I was just in the neighborhood.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.650
You know, room service,
pay-per-view--

41:26.717 --> 41:27.918
I couldn't do it again.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.687
Well, we just ordered some food.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.789
Matt's on his way home.
Why don't you come in?

41:33.757 --> 41:34.925
What?

41:34.992 --> 41:36.927
I was just realizing

41:36.994 --> 41:38.596
it's the second time
I've seen you wearing

41:38.662 --> 41:40.764
a wedding dress
to marry someone else.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.868
Maybe this time
you'll stay for the wedding.

41:43.934 --> 41:45.603
Maybe not.

41:45.669 --> 41:46.937
Matt's the lucky guy.

41:48.973 --> 41:50.908
-Come on in.
-I can't.

41:50.975 --> 41:52.943
I have to...

41:53.010 --> 41:55.880
I got to fax some paper
to my accountant.

41:55.946 --> 41:57.982
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

42:00.217 --> 42:01.819
You look beautiful.
