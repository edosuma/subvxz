to not be my father,

13:37.117 --> 13:38.449
it would actually make sense

13:38.518 --> 13:40.318
<i> why I was treated differently</i>

13:40.387 --> 13:42.554
<i> than my sisters were</i>
<i> growing up as a kid.</i>

13:42.622 --> 13:44.823
Maybe he knows
that I'm not his daughter.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.091
But I feel like I'm nervous
to do it, though.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.128
- My sister was--
well, my sister is my sister,

13:50.197 --> 13:54.232
<i> but my mom when she was young</i>
<i> gave my sister up to adoption</i>

13:54.301 --> 13:57.268
to a family on her street.
- Joanie?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.770
- My mom always knew
Joanie was--

13:58.839 --> 14:00.471
<i> my mom watched Joanie grow up.</i>

14:00.540 --> 14:03.141
<i> But then, as it wasn't</i>
<i> a closed adoption,</i>

14:03.210 --> 14:07.212
later Joanie decided
she wanted to find my mom.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.279
So I didn't know I had--
- She was right

14:08.348 --> 14:09.314
across the street?
- Oh, my God.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.348
- So I didn't know I had
a sister

14:10.417 --> 14:11.649
until I was seven.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.418
- Were you excited?
- Oh, I was so excited.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.485
- Were you guys hugging
and like...

14:14.554 --> 14:15.920
<i> - Yeah, I always</i>
<i> wanted a sister.</i>

14:15.989 --> 14:16.921
<i> - Oh, my God.</i>
<i> - Yeah.</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:17.922
- That's a really cute moment.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.057
- I never knew this.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.058
- My name is Claudette.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.192
- No, it wasn't.
- Yeah, it is.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.193
- That's cute.
- Isn't that the name

14:22.262 --> 14:23.228
of your she-shed?
- Yes, that's why

14:23.296 --> 14:24.229
I said it.
- What the [bleep]?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.396
- And then she said it too.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.397
Let's name her...

14:26.466 --> 14:27.799
- Claudia.
- Claudine.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.801
- [shrieks]
[laughter]

14:29.870 --> 14:31.936
How is that possible?
- Oh, my God!

14:32.005 --> 14:33.104
- Aw.
- Can you imagine?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.772
I would have been a Claudette.
- Wow.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.342
- Do you know why
they gave you up for adoption?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.043
- My mom said they just
had a lot of kids,

14:39.112 --> 14:40.345
and they wanted
to give me a better life.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.080
- Oh, that's good.
- So, like, I'm so grateful.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.314
- Yeah.
- Can you imagine?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.149
I never really talk
about me being adopted

14:45.218 --> 14:47.218
just because I'm so, like,
secure with, like,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.587
how I ended up
with my adopted parents.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.055
<i> You know, they're my parents.</i>

14:51.124 --> 14:53.224
<i> I never really had</i>
<i> the urge to, like,</i>

14:53.293 --> 14:54.959
<i> go and look for my parents.</i>

14:55.028 --> 14:59.797
If I had the chance to, like,
meet them, I think I would.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.799
I would just love to see, like,
what my parents look like.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.601
And I had brothers
and sisters too.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.969
- How many?
- I've always wanted

15:05.038 --> 15:06.804
brothers and sisters.
- How many, like, a lot?

15:06.873 --> 15:08.139
- I feel like ten.
[chuckles]

15:08.208 --> 15:10.275
- How did your mom meet them?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.877
Like, did she go through
a whole process to get you?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.646
- Yeah, my mom,
she couldn't have babies.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.514
So she was trying
to adopt kids,

15:16.583 --> 15:18.549
and she actually had
a boy first.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.184
And then that fell through.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.220
And they're like, oh,
we have a little tiny Chilean

15:22.289 --> 15:23.655
<i> in Chile.</i>
<i> - Oh, my God.</i>

15:23.723 --> 15:25.356
<i> - And she came and picked</i>
<i> me up at six months.</i>

15:25.425 --> 15:27.125
<i> - Like, in America or...</i>

15:27.193 --> 15:28.626
- No, she came to Chile
to get me.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.194
- Oh, [bleep].

15:30.263 --> 15:31.229
- At the airport.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.164
<i> - That's crazy. That's--wow.</i>

15:33.233 --> 15:35.133
- It doesn't all have to be,
like, cookie cutter.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.601
Like, you don't have
to find a man,

15:36.670 --> 15:38.269
and you don't have
to get remarried.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.671
You don't--
you can do it on your own.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.039
- I don't think
I'm going to get remarried.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.608
- Oh, we're really spilling
our tea today, ladies.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.980
<i> - ♪ I feel electrified ♪</i>

15:49.049 --> 15:50.782
<i> ♪ Deep in the heat,</i>
<i> I'm feeling butterflies ♪</i>

15:50.850 --> 15:52.650
- I don't really like
any of these.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.953
- Wait, are those how the socks
are supposed to be?

15:55.021 --> 15:56.454
- I think I have a wedgie.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.323
- Ow!
I just scratched my nipple.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.657
- Yes, it looks like
I have a bulge,

15:59.726 --> 16:00.792
but I don't give a [bleep].

16:04.631 --> 16:06.731
Is this what a guy feels like?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.599
- They teach you how to--

16:08.668 --> 16:10.168
the placement with the hands?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.169
- The frame?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.705
both: Oh!

16:13.773 --> 16:15.773
- Come on, baby.
Come on, Daddy.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.608
Let's do it.
Which way do you go?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.277
- Yo, y'all guys changed.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.612
I remember when you used
to work out in the gym.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.247
- Since I started training
for "Dancing with the Stars,"

16:23.316 --> 16:26.117
like, my whole world has
just been this competition.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.853
[whispering]
Hips, hips, hips.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.021
- Pelvis forward.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.723
Nice, Vinny!

16:31.791 --> 16:35.994
- Slow, slow, quick, quick,
slow, slow.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.096
- One, two, three.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.064
- And, you know,
I'm getting nervous about it.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.800
<i> But if Mike can do</i>
<i> "Dancing With the Stars,"</i>

16:42.869 --> 16:44.268
like, I can definitely do
"Dancing With the Stars."

16:44.337 --> 16:46.270
- All right, let's focus
on premiere night.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.574
Gym, tanning, and laundry.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.075
- Well, I do
a different GTL now.

16:51.144 --> 16:54.012
Gym, tan, lunch.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.346
- [laughing] Oh.
- Aye.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.481
- You know what I'm saying?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.049
- Wait, what's a Danish accent?

16:58.118 --> 16:59.650
- I don't [bleep] know.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.886
- [bad British accent]
'Ello, I'm a Danish maid.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.421
- I don't think that's
how they speak.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.556
- Danish people,
I'm thinking of, like,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.492
the guy from "Frozen."

17:07.560 --> 17:08.760
[bad British accent]
Like, can I have a beer?

17:08.828 --> 17:10.061
[normal voice] That's not it.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.163
That wasn't it.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.164
'Ello!

17:13.233 --> 17:14.866
Nope.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.834
- Learn Danish.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.302
<i> - [on phone] Ja.</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:23.808
-<i> Ja.</i>
both: Can I have some beer,<i> ja?</i>

17:23.877 --> 17:25.009
- Everything is "ja."

17:25.078 --> 17:26.044
You like what you see,

17:26.112 --> 17:27.045
<i> ja?</i>
<i> - Ja, ja.</i>

17:27.113 --> 17:28.413

17:28.481 --> 17:30.548
You like what you see,<i> ja?</i>

17:30.617 --> 17:32.050

<i> - Ja!</i>

17:37.924 --> 17:40.425
Do you want a frankfurter,<i> ja?</i>

17:40.493 --> 17:43.127
Can I help you make
a Danish,<i> ja?</i>

17:43.196 --> 17:44.796
- [yelling]
Can I have some beer,<i> ja?</i>

17:44.864 --> 17:46.497
- Oh.
- What the [bleep] is that?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.733
- Dogs just heard you outside.
Holy [bleep].

17:48.802 --> 17:49.967
- We're going to kill it.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.770
- Angelina,<i> ja?</i>

17:52.839 --> 17:53.938
- Who is that?

17:54.007 --> 17:54.939
- You there,<i> ja?</i>

17:55.008 --> 17:56.207
- It's a Danish girl.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.475

17:59.446 --> 18:00.778
- [laughs]

18:00.847 --> 18:01.879
- You look so cute.

18:01.948 --> 18:02.914
Wait, why'd you put it up
like that?

18:02.982 --> 18:04.215
- Why'd you hike it up?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.484
<i> - Girl, this isn't,</i>
<i> like, a sexy day.</i>

18:06.553 --> 18:07.819
This is, like, a Danish day.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.154
Like, wear the outfit like
it's supposed to be worn.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.356
I love this outfit.
Chris likes it.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.624
- Are you going to bring it
home to role-play?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.226
- He told me to keep it.
- No, he didn't.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.061
- I swear. You wanna see?
- He does not like it!

18:17.130 --> 18:18.429
- He said--I'll show you.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.266

- Sexy.

18:22.368 --> 18:23.668
- I'm dead. Oh, my God.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.369
- Let me see the picture.
- Oh, my God.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.208
All right, fine.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.676
So don't show my vagina?
- No.

18:31.744 --> 18:36.547
- These dresses are kind of
not my speed, if you will.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.682
<i> I like to show tits.</i>

18:37.750 --> 18:39.383
<i> I like to flaunt myself.</i>

18:39.452 --> 18:41.819
Like, right now, I'm glad
that my nipples are out.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.387
- Are you ready to go,<i> ja?</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:45.056
<i> - Ja!</i>
- I feel like an asshole.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.024
- I think everybody looks
so cute.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.026
- If I go out of this [bleep]
hotel and no one's dressed

18:49.095 --> 18:50.828
like this
and we're the only assholes,

18:50.897 --> 18:52.029
I'm going to be upset.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.030
- OK.

Wait.

- Let's start here.
- Wait, wait.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.006
- Get down.
- We have to get down.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.207
- Wait.
- It smells like skunk.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.242
- Okay, ready?
- Everybody ready?

19:10.517 --> 19:11.782
- That feels cozy.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.651
- Skip to my loo, my darlings.

<i> - You guys aren't even</i>

19:28.201 --> 19:30.668

For real.
- Oh, my God,

19:40.046 --> 19:41.913
no one's dressed up.
- Why did you guys listen?

19:41.981 --> 19:46.150
<i> Everybody is not dressed</i>

19:46.219 --> 19:48.686
[bleep] my life.
