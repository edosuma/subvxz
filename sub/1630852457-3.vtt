WEBVTT

00:10.468 --> 00:12.804
[Bobby] Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.

00:14.514 --> 00:18.393
This is where most of us go
when we think about forgiveness, true?

00:18.476 --> 00:19.477
[woman] Yes.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.147
But what about forgiveness in other forms?

00:23.189 --> 00:24.733
Forgiveness of others.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.570
And then there's my personal favorite,
forgiveness of thyself.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.113
-[man] Mm-hmm.
-[Bobby sighs]

00:30.196 --> 00:33.324
This is probably our toughest battle.
But listen,

00:33.408 --> 00:36.036
if God can forgive, then so can you.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.163
-[Johnny] Bullshit!
-[congregation gasps]

00:39.289 --> 00:42.709
What about that time in Reno
with those soccer moms at the Hyatt?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.129
-[Bobby] Johnny...
-God forgive any of us for that?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.213
Um...

00:48.673 --> 00:50.759
Yes, even that.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.595
Forgiveness is the very core
of Christianity.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.765
I wouldn't know about that.
Not much of a churchgoer.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.017
[Bobby] I'm sorry. Apologies, everyone.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.520
My friend here is going
through some hard times.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.022
Nothing I can't handle.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.692
[Bobby] Johnny, I'm mid-sermon,
so how about you take a seat--

01:07.776 --> 01:11.321
You know this guy was a real badass
back in the day.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.865
Fighting. Drinking.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.992
-Partying.
-[woman] What's he saying?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.078
Sucks you can't get laid anymore, man.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.331
How many times I gotta tell ya?
I'm not a priest.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.249
So your wang can still get tang? Nice.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.502
Forgive me, Father.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.253
For what?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.090
-[yells]
-[groans]

01:30.173 --> 01:31.758
[all exclaim]

01:33.718 --> 01:36.429
[rock music playing]

01:43.103 --> 01:47.774
[man on PA] Officer Ryan to rec center.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.529
Angel. My sweet, sweet Angel.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.573
Your mom's care package was dope.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.159
Empanadas? Next level shit right there.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.328
Be sure to thank her for me.

02:01.746 --> 02:02.705
Still…

02:03.456 --> 02:07.001
empanadas, no empanadas,
this is our table, homie.

02:09.921 --> 02:13.049
[laughs]

02:13.133 --> 02:14.008
Shit.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.969
Kid must be deaf.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.262
[sucks teeth]

02:17.345 --> 02:19.055
I said that's our table!

02:20.932 --> 02:23.017
You ain't deaf, just dumb as shit.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.359
-What you looking at, newbie?
-You OK, man?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.699
Robby Keene. Phone call.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.836
-Hello?
-[Daniel] Robby.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.754
Hi. I'm so glad I got you.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.631
Robby…

02:54.132 --> 02:55.091
R… [sighs]

02:58.761 --> 03:00.555
He still won't take my calls.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.391
-He thinks I betrayed him.
-You helped him.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.144
He'd have a much harsher sentence
if you hadn't.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.896
That doesn't make this easier.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.856
He's a teenager, you know?

03:10.523 --> 03:12.108
People do come around.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.361
I mean, no one hated your cousin
more than I did, and…

03:16.029 --> 03:17.363
even now I have to admit…

03:18.156 --> 03:20.283
he's a decent salesman.

03:21.993 --> 03:26.080
The baby birds are out of the nest.
It's time for mama bird to fly.

03:26.581 --> 03:30.835
So why don't you get in that car
and fly, mamacita? Get in.

03:31.419 --> 03:34.589
-[Daniel] Is business getting any better?
-[Amanda] Sales are still low.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.300
I had marketing scrap
all the karate tie-ins

03:37.383 --> 03:40.053
to get us a little distance
from the school fight.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.931
No more "kicking the competition"
or "chopping prices."

03:43.598 --> 03:45.433
We just have to focus on sales.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.311
The manufacturers won't be pleased
with our numbers.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.980
LaRussos! [laughing]

03:51.689 --> 03:54.400
Tom Cole. What the hell is he doing here?

03:55.235 --> 03:59.656
[sighs] Oh! You got a Keurig.
Shoulda sprung for the Nespresso.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.574
The customers, they line up for it.

04:01.658 --> 04:06.246
But then again, you need two
or three people to actually form a line.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.789
What do you want, Cole?

04:07.872 --> 04:09.874
I heard sales weren't going well.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.044
That happens when you put
kids in comas, am I right? [laughs]

04:13.711 --> 04:17.173
Really, Anoush? You walk in with the guy
and let him talk to me like that?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.301
-It's how he talks. You get used to it.
-What do you want?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.012
Relax, I'm not here to fight.
That's your domain.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.266
I'm here as a friend.
I thought to myself, "Tom,

04:26.349 --> 04:28.810
the LaRussos are spiraling.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.938
I mean, no customers, no Nespresso.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.690
You alone can help them."

04:33.773 --> 04:35.733
So I'm here to make you an offer.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.235
You wanna buy a car?

04:37.735 --> 04:40.530
Dan… A car? No. No, no.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.532
I want the whole shebang.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.255
Hey.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.841
Hey.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.511
I hope it's OK,
me just showing up like this.

05:06.014 --> 05:06.848
How are you?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.852
I mean… Sorry, I… It's a stupid question.

05:10.935 --> 05:11.936
It's OK.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.897
I have a surgery on Friday.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.484
Some doctor from out of state,
supposedly works miracles.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.902
That's great, right?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.447
I'm not getting my hopes up.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.450
The surgery costs a ton.
My mom's gonna be in debt.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.828
And there's no guarantee it'll work, but…

05:30.747 --> 05:32.582
If anyone can beat the odds, it's you.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.130
-Is that from Tory?
-Oh, uh…

05:39.714 --> 05:42.133
Yeah. It's really not that bad.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.634
Yeah.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.303
Kinda makes me look tough.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.641
-I'm sorry about that, Sam.
-You didn't do anything.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.435
She decided to go crazy.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.020
Tory's had a rough life.

05:54.937 --> 05:58.024
-Her mom's sick and--
-Everybody's got a sob story.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.818
-Doesn't give you the right to be a bully.
-Yeah.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.742
I just wanted to give you this.
It's just a card.

06:08.910 --> 06:09.869
[chuckles]

06:12.372 --> 06:13.247
I want that guy.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.876
-An octopus? Interesting.
-[Sam laughs]

06:21.047 --> 06:22.507
[Sam] Miguel, I'm so sorry.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.051
For all of this.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.054
It's, uh... It's OK.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.305
[Hawk] El Serpiente!

06:33.893 --> 06:35.561
-I'm gonna go.
-OK, yeah.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.443
You got some nerve coming here
after what your boyfriend did.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.405
I don't care what you think.
I just wanna help.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.199
Pretty sure you've done enough, princess.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.702
Hey, bro. What's up, man? You good?

06:51.786 --> 06:53.454
-I like the spot.
-[Miguel laughs]

06:53.538 --> 06:54.455
Holding up?

06:58.126 --> 07:00.503
I still don't get
how they get coffee in the cake.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.004
Johnny…

07:02.964 --> 07:04.590
what was that all about?

07:05.091 --> 07:08.594
I know you're upset, but don't
blame yourself for what Robby did.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.263
I'm not allowed to see him.

07:11.180 --> 07:15.101
Since I'm on probation
for that incident in the parking garage.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.603
Yeah. You're lucky it was only probation.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.107
I'm lucky I knew a priest who put
a good word in with the judge.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.984
-Thank you very much.
-Not a priest.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.321
[sighs] How about we make a deal?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.907
You promise yourself
to do positive things.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.576
Be a better person.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.703
I already tried that.

07:33.786 --> 07:37.790
I put everything I had into my students,
taught 'em to be tough and show mercy.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.461
-Was I doing the right thing?
-You were.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.962
Then why'd this happen?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.298
You wanna punish me, fine.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.217
-Robby and Miguel, they're just kids.
-I know.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.761
I know. It isn't fair.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.558
But you don't do the right thing
'cause it always works out,

07:55.641 --> 07:58.394
you do it
'cause it's the right thing to do.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.356
Both those kids need you.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.526
You need to be there for them,
whether it works out or not.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.237
I can help you with Robby.

08:09.155 --> 08:13.367
The detention center will let you in
if accompanied by a member of the clergy.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.369
How about we meet there tomorrow?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.457
-That'd be great.
-Good.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.666
[chuckles]

08:21.626 --> 08:23.419
As for Miguel and his surgery,

08:23.503 --> 08:27.340
the church can make a donation,
but we're still paying for our new roof.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.343
I wasn't even gonna ask.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.930
Why not ask your stepdad?
He's still loaded, isn't he?

08:34.972 --> 08:38.976
No way. Sid? It'd be his dream come true.
Me grovelling for his money.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.980
I'll figure something out.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.775
I know you will.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.863
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah. Good little talk, buddy.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.120
You're serious?
You wanna buy our dealership?

08:58.204 --> 09:02.250
-Christmas came early, Danny boy.
-This offer is hardly Christmas morning.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.962
-It's not even a Secretary's Day gift.
-They prefer executive assistant.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.130
-Oh, do they?
-[Cole] Mm.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.258
Look, I believe in karma.

09:10.341 --> 09:13.594
What goes up, over a balcony,
must come down.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.473
The Valley has spoken. No one wants
to do business with a bully.

09:18.140 --> 09:22.353
-I'm just trying to help clear the debt.
-OK. One, I am not a bully.

09:22.436 --> 09:26.691
And two, there are plenty of people
walking through that door every day.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.068
We are doing just fine.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.279
[laughs]

09:31.362 --> 09:34.115
You almost look like you believe that!

09:34.198 --> 09:35.157
[slaps table]

09:35.241 --> 09:36.742
Oh, that was very convincing.

09:36.826 --> 09:41.122
If all this disappears tomorrow,
which it will, where does that leave you?

09:41.205 --> 09:43.374
Why don't you try and get something…

09:45.543 --> 09:47.795
before it's worth nothing?

09:54.385 --> 09:56.470
I can't believe you work
for that mamaluke.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.682
That's the most goombah thing
you've ever said.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.768
Hey! Take it easy.
That's not your word, that's our word.

10:02.852 --> 10:03.853
Is it, though?

10:04.854 --> 10:08.691
I don't know. Still, I didn't like
your tone, the way you said it.

10:08.774 --> 10:09.609
OK.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.779
-You still over on Lankashim?
-No.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.782
Upgraded to a small two-bedroom
over on Outpost.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.618
-Good for you, man.
-Yeah, thanks.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.579
I'm trying to move,
I'm still over at the 99-Cent store.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.416
That place sucks. You gotta see
the degenerates that come in and out.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.961
I'm gonna get my own spot
now that I got job stability.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.254
[Anoush sighs]

10:30.963 --> 10:32.465
Don't be so sure of that.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.343
What you talking about?

10:36.677 --> 10:39.889
Anoush, I know you know something.
What do you know?

10:42.516 --> 10:44.518
[imperceptible]

10:46.812 --> 10:48.939
OK, you didn't hear this from me.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.610
Cole signed an exclusive deal.
with Doyona International in Tokyo.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.571
They distribute all the major
Japanese car companies.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.324
-What? We sell Japanese brands.
-Not for long.

10:58.407 --> 11:01.952
Cole had Doyona convince
the manufacturers to cut ties with you.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.081
-Daniel's contract's gonna be voided.
-[Daniel] Get out.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.540
We will never sell to you.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.042
[Cole] OK. Your loss.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.919
Faroush, come on, let's go.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.717
You believe that guy?
What makes him think we'd sell to him?

11:16.801 --> 11:17.760
[Louie] Guys…

11:18.260 --> 11:19.637
we really gotta talk.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.182
[electro-pop music playing]

11:29.605 --> 11:30.773
[customer] Here you go.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.650
[girl] Watch out!

11:34.568 --> 11:37.530
[Sam] Great, guys. Keep it up.
A line of cars around the block.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.033
Hey, Stu.
It's left circle, and then right circle.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.661
You got it. Hey, Moon.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.413
Hey.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.498
Thanks for bringing the cheerleaders,

11:47.581 --> 11:50.292
they are definitely helping
to attract customers.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.505
-I thought you were a feminist?
-I'm a sex-positive feminist.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.465
Our bodies are an expression.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.595
[chuckles]

12:04.640 --> 12:06.726
Hey! Could we be next?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.562
[Chris] Sure thing!

12:11.564 --> 12:13.899
Want the wash and wax or just the wash?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.944
-Hold up. You doing it?
-[Chris] I'mma get you all straight.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.072
-No streaks, right?
-That'll be 20 bucks. Thank you.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.240
Hey!

12:26.495 --> 12:28.497
[rock music playing]

12:40.301 --> 12:41.135
Thank you.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.345
They're using Miguel
as their poster child.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.557
He's not Miyagi-Do.
They think they can get away with that?

12:47.725 --> 12:48.726
They won't.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.488
[man] To be honest,
this job entails a lot of grunt work.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.615
Moving furniture, hanging pictures.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.950
Execs always wanna
rearrange their offices.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.621
Yeah. I've done maintenance work,
so I know how it goes.

13:09.163 --> 13:13.167
It says here on your resume
you have extensive computer experience.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.920
Pretty sure I remember
how to get on the Internet.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.171
[chuckles] Yeah.

13:17.254 --> 13:21.509
I'll do whatever you need. You know,
I'll show up early or work overtime.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.511
Just need some extra money.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.556
It's not for me, it's for this kid
going through a surgery.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.266
His family needs the scratch.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.354
Well, that's very noble.
You have a lot of what we're looking for.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.022
Oh, great.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.857
I just… One last thing.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.694
Um... I noticed you didn't
fill out the part about any prior arrests.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.865
Hey, we're just a couple guys
talking here.

13:44.949 --> 13:48.035
I mean, what are we dealing with,
DUI, petty theft?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.037
This is just a formality.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.580
No one's perfect.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.290
All right.

13:53.916 --> 13:54.792
Well…

13:57.044 --> 13:59.755
most recently,
I was arrested for public intoxication.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.424
Assault and battery.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.342
And, uh…

14:03.843 --> 14:06.929
"willful destruction of property,"
I think they said.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.931
Not necessarily in that order.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.268
And a year ago I was arrested
for assaulting a minor.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.936
A minor?

14:14.019 --> 14:17.273
Technically, multiple minors.
Those kids were real pricks.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.402
[chuckles] You know, it feels
really good to talk about this, actually.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.822
When do we start, boss? What's the plan?

14:30.452 --> 14:33.163
"Unstable."
You're the one that's unstable.

14:35.791 --> 14:36.917
Unstable!

14:44.466 --> 14:47.803
[reporter on TV] Students from
West Valley High are volunteering today,

14:47.887 --> 14:50.598
washing cars to raise money
for a worthy cause.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.643
[Sam] We've raised over $1,000.
Miyagi-Do is all about helping people.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.063
[reporter] Didn't a Miyagi-Do student
put Miguel Diaz in the hospital?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.398
That was an accident.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.692
At least, I hope so.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.610
I…

15:03.193 --> 15:05.362
I just know Miguel needs our help.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.656
We love you, Miguel.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.201
[reporter] Thanks, Samantha.
This car wash will be going on--

15:11.285 --> 15:12.369
That's your girl?

15:13.579 --> 15:16.081
Sounds like vanilla
not her flavor no more.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.958
She got a taste for that horchata.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.962
Who knows?
Maybe she’ll be drinking dark roast next.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.301
-How 'bout you shut your mouth?
-Sorry-ass punk.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.305
-Looks like karate boy wanna throw down.
-[youth 1] Sure does.

15:31.388 --> 15:32.431
[youth 2] Yeah, man.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.102
Go ahead. I'll give you a free shot
before I use your teeth for dice.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.938
My karate's about self-defense.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.690
Oh. Well...

15:42.608 --> 15:44.234
Let's see how that works out for you.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.654
[all grunting]

15:46.737 --> 15:48.030
[youths yelling]

15:54.036 --> 15:55.329
[yelling]

15:56.914 --> 15:58.916
[Robby groaning]

16:00.000 --> 16:01.251
[youths] Ooh!

16:07.508 --> 16:09.051
[alarm blaring]

16:12.471 --> 16:14.264
This was a warm-up. We ain't done.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.226
[guard over PA] Get back to your bunks.
We're on lockdown.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.565
[chuckles] Let's get outta here, man.
Dumbass. That'll teach him.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.526
[pained breathing]

16:33.033 --> 16:35.995
-Hey, look who the cat dragged in!
-[Johnny sighs]

16:36.078 --> 16:37.371
Oh, come on!

16:37.454 --> 16:40.624
Are you really trying to sell me
that same box of crap?

16:40.708 --> 16:44.169
I wasn't trying to sell it to you.
That's why I drove to Winnetka.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.671
I have three locations.

16:46.338 --> 16:50.467
You'd be surprised how much you can make
selling junkies their wedding rings back.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.595
How much for the computer?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.681
What do I want with a used laptop?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.391
You sold it to me used!

16:57.474 --> 16:59.309
Yeah, well, now it's more used.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.187
It just needs new batteries.
It ran outta juice.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.023
These don't run outta juice.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.900
Did you plug it in?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.278
You said it was wireless.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.363
Yeah. Wireless as in…

17:12.072 --> 17:12.906
never mind.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.118
Got anything else in there
besides your useless crap?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.746
This whole place is full of useless crap.

17:18.829 --> 17:22.958
-What makes your crap better than my crap?
-Simple. My crap has value.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.961
You want money,
bring me something of value.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.090
I got a '93 Dodge Caravan.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.633
Really? '93, you say?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.345
Let's just…
take a look at the Kelley Blue Book.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.348
All right. It's got a tape deck.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.851
-Grayish cloth interior.
-Cloth interior?

17:40.934 --> 17:43.771
Yeah. That's interesting.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.982
-What does it say?
-"Get the hell outta my shop."

17:47.066 --> 17:48.609
-It's worthless.
-Come on.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.862
What am I supposed to do?
I don't own anything valuable.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.282
Then I guess
you better find someone who does.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.576
[stacking objects]

18:09.505 --> 18:11.006
[door opening]

18:12.257 --> 18:14.635
-Where is everyone?
-Figured we'd close early.

18:14.718 --> 18:18.263
Batten down the hatches
until we straighten this out.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
How was lunch with Anoush?

18:21.433 --> 18:25.145
Well, good news is
he's speaking to me again.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.897
Bad news is…

18:27.523 --> 18:29.233
he was telling Louie the truth.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.695
[sighs] Cole leaned into the bad press
on the school fight.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.448
He'll be exclusive with Doyona
by next month.

18:38.742 --> 18:43.122
If we lose this dealership, what's to stop
other manufacturers pulling out?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
That's what Cole's banking on.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.752
See, I say we go visit Cole,
show him a little Jersey justice.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.421
What will you do?
Round up your biker friends,

18:51.505 --> 18:52.923
get your asses kicked again?

18:53.006 --> 18:57.636
-I thought we weren't gonna talk--
-Daniel, I don't think we have a choice.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.557
If we wanna come out of this
with anything, we have to sell to Cole.

19:04.726 --> 19:05.769
[sighs]

19:09.773 --> 19:10.941
[Daniel sighs]

19:12.776 --> 19:15.737
When I was a kid,
I wanted my own car so bad.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.242
My mom had this station wagon.
It was such a piece of junk. We…

19:20.951 --> 19:24.163
We literally had to push it
to get the engine started.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.125
And then Mr. Miyagi gave me
that '47 Ford, and…

19:29.751 --> 19:31.753
that was the best day of my life.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.675
Ever since, I've been in love with cars.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.346
That's why Mr. Miyagi pushed me
into sales. Wasn't my idea.

19:41.930 --> 19:46.310
-I thought car salesmen were sleazy.
-That is such a bullshit stereotype.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.895
But Mr. Miyagi told me,

19:49.396 --> 19:50.355
"Daniel-san…

19:51.315 --> 19:52.733
must follow passion.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.195
Man who work for passion always richer

19:56.987 --> 19:59.072
-than man who work for money."
-[mouthing]

20:01.950 --> 20:03.076
He was right.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.039
The goal was never to be
the Valley's number one auto dealer.

20:07.831 --> 20:12.044
I just wanted to give those customers
that same sense of excitement I had

20:12.127 --> 20:13.462
when I got my first car.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.465
That's what I did,
and that's why we were successful.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.799
[Amanda] But, Daniel,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
without Doyona, we can't compete.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.640
I love what we built here.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.893
I love that we did it together.

20:27.976 --> 20:31.271
And I don't wanna lose it,
but the writing's on the wall.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.274
If we don't sell to Cole…

20:35.067 --> 20:36.818
we might end up with nothing.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.035
Louie, why don't we, um…

20:45.661 --> 20:47.329
go finish those inventories?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.680
[Mr. Miyagi] Close eye. Trust.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.847
Concentrate.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.727
Think only tree.

21:12.354 --> 21:16.149
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

21:16.233 --> 21:20.112
Wipe your mind clean, everything but tree.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.740
Nothing exists whole world.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.410
Only tree.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.245
You got it?

21:29.955 --> 21:30.956
Open eye.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.713
[exhales slowly]

21:42.426 --> 21:43.635
No shit.

21:44.219 --> 21:48.015
This your bed?
I had no idea, I just needed a pillow.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.309
Don't mind, do you?

21:51.518 --> 21:52.394
[chuckles]

21:53.395 --> 21:54.396
Thought so.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.564
Soft-ass bitch.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.070
What'd I say? [laughs]

22:05.615 --> 22:08.160
All right, listen up. Visitation tomorrow.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.497
Valasquez, Binder, Espinoza, Keene.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.459
If I called your name,
be ready first thing.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.337
Does it say who's visiting me?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.505
"Lawrence, John."

22:30.057 --> 22:31.641
[doorbell rings]

22:42.444 --> 22:44.446
[Johnny sighs]

22:47.866 --> 22:49.117
[chuckles]

22:49.993 --> 22:53.705
"Gender pay gap," you figure. Shit.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.708
Well…

22:57.709 --> 23:00.295
Well, well, well, well.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.755
Lookie who's back.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.466
I won't be here longer than I have to.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.385
How's that karate thing going?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.554
Oh! [mock gasps]

23:10.180 --> 23:12.265
It didn't go under, did it?

23:12.974 --> 23:14.267
Oh!

23:15.102 --> 23:16.895
-I'm shocked!
-This isn't about me.

23:16.978 --> 23:19.356
There's this kid, Miguel--

23:19.439 --> 23:21.525
[Sid] Yeah, I heard something about that.

23:21.608 --> 23:25.821
Your son and your student,
talk about a role model.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.114
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.409
Oh. Hey, easy there, Rocko.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.079
Sounded like you were warming up
to ask for a handout.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.623
And I'd hate for anything to jeopardize…

23:37.374 --> 23:39.292
another payday.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.086
All right, so you'll help me?

23:41.169 --> 23:42.796
I didn't say that either.

23:42.879 --> 23:45.882
Look, you can kick me around
all you want, Sid. I'll take it.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.094
Miguel doesn't deserve what happened.
I need to make it right.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.179
Yeah, with my money.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.684
-[scoffs] You prick!
-If I had anything to give, I would.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.812
But you got nothing to give
because you're a loser,

23:58.895 --> 23:59.896
like your father!

24:01.398 --> 24:05.986
Yeah, you can say what you want about me,
but at least I stuck around.

24:06.069 --> 24:09.948
Being a bully isn't much better
than leaving. I'm trying to do better.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.701
-I'm gonna see Robby.
-[Sid] Yeah.

24:12.784 --> 24:16.079
I'm scraping together what I can
to help Miguel's family.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.957
Pope John Lawrence the first!

24:19.541 --> 24:22.294
Yeah, healer of children. [applauds]

24:23.336 --> 24:26.631
-Bravo, bravo, bravo!
-All right, are you gonna help me or not?

24:26.715 --> 24:30.760
'Cause I'd hate for that little incident
with your secretary to get out.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.930
You know, start one of those
hash brown "me too" things.

24:34.431 --> 24:38.685
I didn't get where I am
because I cared about my reputation.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.355
Get the hell out of here.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.859
You're a cold old man.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.361
And don't you forget it, buster.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.827
[funky music playing]

25:02.959 --> 25:05.128
-Great day, guys.
-Yeah, definitely.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.885
[engines revving]

25:16.306 --> 25:17.307
[tires screech]

25:22.103 --> 25:25.565
-You picked the wrong side.
-Hey, give it back! Hey!

25:25.649 --> 25:27.484
-[boys laughing]
-[Mitch] Ooh, ooh!

25:27.567 --> 25:29.444
Nothing like a long day of charity.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.988
We'll make sure Miguel knows
it's from Cobra Kai.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.824
-[Hawk laughs] Don't even think about it.
-Come on.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.743
We all wanna help pay for the surgery.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.745
You're gonna pay, all right.

25:42.415 --> 25:43.750
[Cole] Daniel, Amanda.

25:44.334 --> 25:48.338
Aw, I know this must be
a tough pill to swallow.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.217
No matter how you wash it down,

25:52.968 --> 25:55.095
failure never tastes good.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.307
But at the end of the day,
it's just business, right?

26:01.226 --> 26:05.480
We looked at the offer in front of us,
and realized there's only one choice.

26:08.275 --> 26:12.404
I want you to know that I'm gonna
treat this place with the utmost respect.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.700
You can take the tiny bushes.
Nobody wants to care for a tree.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.034
Oh, Faroush,

26:18.118 --> 26:20.829
you are looking at the new owner
of LaRusso Van Nuys.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.706
[Amanda] Mm. Not so fast, Tom.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.332
We made some adjustments.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.334
Look at page nine.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.633
I don't understand.
Are you selling or not?

26:34.217 --> 26:35.802
When hell freezes over.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.471
Then let me give you the bad news.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.391
-I signed an exclusive deal with--
-Doyona.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.642
Yeah.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.185
We know all about that.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.317
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

26:50.400 --> 26:52.319
Daniel offered me my job back.

26:52.402 --> 26:56.906
And since he knows my name
and isn't a complete douche clown,

26:56.990 --> 26:58.325
I accepted.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.911
Fine. You wanna play
the violin on the Titanic,

27:02.412 --> 27:03.747
it's your funeral.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.874
We're not dead yet, Tommy.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.083
[Cole] Yeah, right!

27:07.792 --> 27:09.502
We've still got some moves!

27:10.211 --> 27:12.047
Well, there's no turning back now.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.466
This plan better work.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.593
It has to.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.220
Wait, what? This isn't a sure thing?

27:22.140 --> 27:23.308
[doorbell ringing]

27:25.810 --> 27:27.812
-Hey, what's up?
-Is your dad here?

27:28.396 --> 27:29.689
No, he's at work. Why?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.192
Cobra Kai took the money and…

27:32.275 --> 27:34.319
They kicked the fucking shit outta me.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.279
[exhales heavily]

27:44.579 --> 27:46.915
Hey, uh, I'm not sure who I give this to.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.876
It's for the Diaz kid's hospital bill.

27:50.794 --> 27:55.131
Wow. That's very generous.
Can I tell the family who it's from?

27:55.215 --> 27:58.259
Uh, I'd prefer to leave my name out of it.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.928
[nurse] Sure. No problem.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.183
Hey.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.435
I'm leaving.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.398
Ms. Diaz, Miguel's surgeon
just arrived from the airport.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.941
She has a few questions.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.571
Thank you, Johnny.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.163
I'm gonna get outta here.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.456
[speaks Spanish]

28:29.958 --> 28:31.376
I have to be somewhere.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.296
[melancholy music playing]

28:35.380 --> 28:36.381
[in English] Miguel…

28:38.091 --> 28:39.759
He needs you.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.720
Please.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.806
Pray with us.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.186
OK, I'll stay.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.067
[buzzer sounds]

29:06.619 --> 29:09.289
Hey, just give him a little more time, OK?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.466
He's not coming. I knew it.

29:28.516 --> 29:29.726
You sure about this?

29:30.977 --> 29:33.688
Cobra Kais never stop training.
We have to catch up.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.107
If that means me taking the reins,
so be it.

29:37.150 --> 29:40.528
I am ready
to add a few new moves to my repertoire.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.281
Hold on a sec. What if your dad finds out?

29:44.783 --> 29:47.035
He won't. He's out of town.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.920
Mr. LaRusso? They are ready for you now.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.180
[epic music playing]

30:18.399 --> 30:20.318
[electronic music plays]
