ELI:
KaHnda?

00:09.070 --> 00:10.560
Eli, I need to
speak with Alicia.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.702
Is she there with you?

00:11.740 --> 00:13.071
She's on the dais.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.270
She can't come now.
What's wrong?

00:14.310 --> 00:16.346
Eli, I need to speak to her.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.745
Kalinda...

00:17.780 --> 00:20.613
she's in the middle
of the correspondence luncheon.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.538
Eli...

00:22.590 --> 00:23.784
Will is dead.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.357
COMEDIAN:
When you start talking
about medical marijuana,

00:26.390 --> 00:27.516
everybody gets tense.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.709
There was a shooting
in the courthouse

00:28.760 --> 00:30.819
and he got caught up
in the cross fire.

00:30.860 --> 00:33.055
I need to speak to Alicia.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.125
I mean, I kind of see
that with my mother...

00:35.160 --> 00:37.094
Yes.

00:37.130 --> 00:38.597
Just a second.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.495
...each and every one
of you, you know,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.132
but I'm here to tell
you that, after...

00:42.170 --> 00:43.535
(crowd laughs)

00:43.570 --> 00:46.334
There's a call for you.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.076
Now?

00:49.110 --> 00:50.077
Yes, you have to take it.

00:50.110 --> 00:53.716

00:53.750 --> 00:55.172

00:59.490 --> 01:01.412
(laughter)

01:03.160 --> 01:04.752
(normal voice):
Now, I know that you guys

01:04.790 --> 01:05.654
have been waiting
for the governor.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.590
He's a little late,
he's in traffic...

01:07.630 --> 01:09.120
Hello.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.634
Alicia... it's me.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.160
Yes. Kalinda, what's wrong?

01:18.570 --> 01:19.605
Will's been shot.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.100
He...
wh-what do you mean?

01:24.150 --> 01:26.209
There was, uh,
gunfire at the courthouse

01:26.250 --> 01:28.309
and... he was shot.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.489
Will... um...

01:30.520 --> 01:32.283
I-I don't understand, by who?

01:32.320 --> 01:35.187
His client, uh...
I'm in the hospital and...

01:39.360 --> 01:40.622
(crying):
Will is dead.

01:41.860 --> 01:44.897
COMEDIAN:
Fine, no ice cream for you...

01:44.930 --> 01:46.591
(laughter)

01:46.640 --> 01:48.130
I'm sorry, Alicia. He...

01:48.170 --> 01:50.832
He was killed.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.708
(crying):
I... can't...

01:54.740 --> 01:56.879
I... um... no.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.339
But I just saw him yesterday.
(sighs)

02:01.380 --> 02:03.211
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:05.450 --> 02:08.283
Alicia, uh...
I'll call you back.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.548
I need to speak to the police,

02:09.590 --> 02:11.319
then I will call you back.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.799
I'm sorry.

02:15.830 --> 02:16.899

02:16.930 --> 02:17.862
COMEDIAN:
It is an honor to be here

02:17.900 --> 02:20.334
_ and I want_to
Introduce to you right now,

02:20.370 --> 02:22.361
the First Lady of Illinois.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.435
(applause)

02:24.470 --> 02:26.734
I'll introduce Peter.
You-you go.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.169
(applause continues)

02:29.210 --> 02:29.904
You're in no
condition, AIICIa.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.578
Go ahead.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.655
COMEDIAN:
And the First Lady
had to step outside.

02:40.690 --> 02:43.181
Uh, Mr. Gold?

02:43.230 --> 02:44.652
Do you want to
do the honors?

02:44.690 --> 02:47.295
(applause)

02:48.600 --> 02:50.329
Th-Thank you, Bobby.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.565
(clears throat)

02:52.600 --> 02:53.931
It's my honor

02:53.970 --> 02:56.268
to introduce
the man I've shared my...

02:57.910 --> 03:01.209
uh... m-many campaigns with

03:01.240 --> 03:03.242
over the past few years.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.804
We've had good times...

03:04.850 --> 03:06.374
and bad...

03:06.420 --> 03:08.877
and we've had our share
of disagreements.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.911
Who takes out the garbage.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.885
Who changes the diapers.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.626
What is he doing?

03:16.660 --> 03:18.628
Which brings me to a funny story
about how I chose this...

03:20.000 --> 03:22.218
outfit for today.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.226
Where's Alicia?

03:27.970 --> 03:29.608
*

03:40.320 --> 03:41.378

04:16.320 --> 04:18.311
(laughter
and indistinct conversation)

04:32.370 --> 04:33.337
Is everything all right?

04:33.370 --> 04:35.338
I need to speak to the partners.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.065
Yes. They're ready.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.668
They've been wondering
where you were.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.507
It's the vote
on the LA. office.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.509
Tell them I'll be right in.

04:48.650 --> 04:50.447
(sighing)

04:51.750 --> 04:53.081
(sniffles)

04:53.120 --> 04:55.315
(panﬁng)

05:06.130 --> 05:07.939
(quietly sobs)

05:18.150 --> 05:20.448
(sighs)

05:20.480 --> 05:22.448
I thought this meeting
was at 2:00.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.582
I have a client waiting.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.689
HOWARD:
What did we decide?

05:24.720 --> 05:25.948
We haven't decided
anything yet.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.878
What is going on, Diane?

05:27.920 --> 05:28.909
We're late here.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.120
Yes, I'm sorry.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.684
We've had a situation.

05:31.730 --> 05:32.856
At the courthouse.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.652
HOWARD:
What, what, what'd I miss?

05:34.700 --> 05:35.826
Will was shot.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.122
What?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.468
He-he-he was what?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.764
I've just come
from the hospital.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.903
Will was sh... Will Gardner?

05:42.940 --> 05:43.929
DIANE:
Yes.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.934
He's dead.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.403
WOMAN:
What?
(people gasping)

05:47.440 --> 05:48.805
HOWARD:
Oh, my God.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.347
Will is dead?

05:53.180 --> 05:55.444
(indistinct conversations)

06:02.590 --> 06:05.127
REPORTER:
Apparently some sort of shooting
has taken place

06:05.160 --> 06:06.650
within one of the courtrooms.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.759
Details are sketchy
at this point...

06:10.100 --> 06:11.067
Get out.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.431
Get out!

06:17.110 --> 06:18.099
(door closes)

06:20.710 --> 06:22.871

06:29.120 --> 06:30.485
(woman hysterically sobbing)

06:34.790 --> 06:37.122
(sobbing)

06:37.160 --> 06:38.787
Ben Collins called for Will.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.559
He heard there was
a shooting at the courthouse.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.555
Who is that?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.727
Gail. The new intern.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.123
How long has she been here?

06:45.170 --> 06:46.432
A week?

06:46.470 --> 06:48.461
(Gail continues sobbing)

06:53.640 --> 06:54.607
Are you done?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.471
Excuse me?

06:56.510 --> 06:57.943
Are you done crying?

06:57.980 --> 07:00.210
I... I don't know.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.172
Get your things and go home.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.209
What?

07:04.250 --> 07:05.478
Take your things
from your desk.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.010
Leave here. Go home.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.982
And don't come back.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.521
(elevator bell dings)

07:10.560 --> 07:13.427
(gasps)

07:29.140 --> 07:32.007

07:32.050 --> 07:34.177
MAN (over radio):
Alpha Five, that's gonna be
SWAT's call--

07:34.220 --> 07:37.485
if they want to get
an escort through there...

07:40.560 --> 07:43.757
Can you confirm
the roof access is secure?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.223
(line ringing)

07:50.270 --> 07:51.225
JENNA:
Yeah?

07:51.270 --> 07:52.225
I'm, I'm here.

07:52.270 --> 07:53.259
I need your help.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.632
Yeah, I see you.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.904
(softly):
Excuse me.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.874
Thanks, she's with me.

08:00.910 --> 08:03.174
DETECTIVE: _
You weren't paying
attention at all, were you?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.007
So what happened next?

08:05.050 --> 08:06.642
SHERIFF:
I was just standing there...

08:06.680 --> 08:08.511
and I turned around
and... he had a gun.

08:08.550 --> 08:09.983
DETECTIVE 2:
Who had a gun?
The defendant?

08:10.020 --> 08:11.180
SHERIFF:
Yeah. Jeffrey Grant.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.108
He had your gun?
Yeah, but I don't know how.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.554
I mean, I got a text.
I looked at a text,

08:17.590 --> 08:19.558
because my girlfriend,
she's pregnant.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.522
Do you usually text
during court?
I didn't text.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.891
I got a text.
When you heard
the first shot,

08:22.930 --> 08:24.158
what did you see?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.224
The kid, Jeffrey Grant,
he was...

08:25.270 --> 08:26.532
Did you try
to get your gun back?

08:28.570 --> 08:29.605
No.

08:29.640 --> 08:30.834
Why not?
What?
You're kidding me.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.576
Unbelievable.
SHERIFF:
You weren't there.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.474
The kid was just
firing everywhere!

08:33.510 --> 08:34.977
So, what'd you do?
Witness said you dove

08:35.010 --> 08:36.238
behind the first
bench in the gallery.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.248
Is that true?

08:38.280 --> 08:40.248
You okay?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.077
Where's Jeffrey Grant?

08:42.120 --> 08:43.087
They're holding him.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.212
Here?

08:44.250 --> 08:45.319
It's not gonna
make a difference.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.749
Jenna”.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.327
Jeffrey Grant, our client?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.588
Yes.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.552
He was on trial
for murder.
Yes.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.965
But he...

08:59.600 --> 09:01.659
That was supposed to be my case.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.299
(door opens)

09:05.340 --> 09:06.637
Diane, do you have a minute?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.603
DIANE:
Sorry, I'll be right back.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.679
(sighs)

09:18.250 --> 09:19.979
I'm sorry, Alicia.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.248
Thank you.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.691
(door closes)

09:34.340 --> 09:36.092
(phone ringing)

09:44.410 --> 09:45.604
Hi.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.118
CARY:
Where are you?

09:48.150 --> 09:49.310
I'm at Lockhart/Gardner...

09:49.350 --> 09:50.817
Alicia, what are you doing?

09:50.850 --> 09:52.340
The deposition is now.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.608
We promised to give Candace our
full attention. We can't just...

09:54.660 --> 09:56.355
What are you...?

09:56.390 --> 09:57.789
What are you doing
at Lockhart/Gardner?

09:57.830 --> 09:58.854
Cary...

10:04.400 --> 10:05.992
Will is dead.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.236
What do you mean?

10:09.270 --> 10:11.363
He was shot during his trial.
He's dead.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.378
We have to delay the deposition.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.869
I'm-I'm, I'm-I'm just,
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm...

10:21.920 --> 10:23.114
I have to go.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.310
Alicia?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.681
Are you all right?

10:25.720 --> 10:28.314
I'll call you back, Cary.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.225
(indistinct conversation)

10:33.430 --> 10:34.897
Is she coming?

10:34.930 --> 10:36.227
Where is she?

10:36.260 --> 10:38.228
I... um...

10:40.470 --> 10:42.392
We need to delay this, Candace.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.738
What?

10:44.770 --> 10:47.204
I have to call Will's clients.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.231
It's not out yet
that Will is dead,

10:49.280 --> 10:51.339
but when it is, the clients
will be looking around.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.041
David, please.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.718
But more importantly,

10:54.750 --> 10:56.411
other firms will be poaching.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.008
David, my best friend just died.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.448
Diane, I'm sorry.

11:01.490 --> 11:05.085
I-I don't want to be doing this
any more than you do,

11:05.130 --> 11:08.190
but the car is moving,
and someone has to drive.

11:08.230 --> 11:12.166
I'm just asking your permission
to break it to the clients.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.361
(sighs)
All right.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.377
Just... do what you do.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.443
(beeps)

11:32.490 --> 11:34.856
_ _ KALINDA:
AllCla, please call me

I need to tell you.

11:42.030 --> 11:44.260
(beeps)

11:44.300 --> 11:46.939
Alicia, it's Diane.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.858
We're trying to get ahold
of you.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.458
Please call.

Mr. Gardner,
we're just about ready here.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.094
WILL:
H-Hold on, Your Honor.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.289
I'll call you back.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.331
(line disconnects)

12:50.530 --> 12:52.521
*

13:02.510 --> 13:03.977
(beeps)

13:04.010 --> 13:06.001
Alicia.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.548
POLITI:
Mr. Gardner,
we're just about ready here.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.945
WILL:
H-Hold on, Your Honor.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.184
I'll call you back.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.380
(line disconnects)

13:22.600 --> 13:24.818
DIANE: I have no idea
why he would call.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.963
He called at 11:30.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.365
Wasn't he in court?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.231
They must've been on a break.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.077
Was he upset?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.407
At?

13:37.450 --> 13:38.974
Me?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.318
No. Why?

13:40.350 --> 13:43.080
Candace came to our firm.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.417
We poached her just yesterday.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.542
She was Will's client.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.080
Will had dealt with all of that.

13:48.090 --> 13:49.318
You sure?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.988
You can blame yourself
for anything you want,

13:52.030 --> 13:53.588
but Will was...

13:53.630 --> 13:56.428
He was moving fast
on a lot of fronts.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.893
He was...

14:03.570 --> 14:05.231
(sighs)

14:05.270 --> 14:06.976
I loved him.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.001
I know.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.274
He loved you.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.279
You can stay if you want.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.319
No.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.191
(elevator bell dings)

14:38.540 --> 14:39.666
(phone beeps)

14:39.710 --> 14:42.031
WILL:
Alicia.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.069
This feud, it's stupid.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.146
I-I care about you too much
to let it come...

14:46.150 --> 14:48.345
(sighs)

14:49.990 --> 14:53.016
(phone beeps)
Alicia, are you kidding me?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.687
Leave my clients alone, Alicia.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.051
Find your own.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.328
(crowd chattering)

15:04.370 --> 15:06.964
(indistinct radio transmission)

15:07.000 --> 15:08.991
(door slams distantly)

15:12.640 --> 15:15.302
But you do admit to taking
the sheriff's gun?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.979
You were angry about
Dr. Delaney's testimony?

15:18.010 --> 15:20.149
His false testimony.
We'd rather hear it
from your client.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.978
You were angry about
Dr. Delaney's testimony?

15:23.020 --> 15:24.282
(grunts)

15:24.320 --> 15:25.582
The accused nodded in assent.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.019
But he was lying,
right, Jeffrey?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.550
He was the real killer.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.228
(crying):
I-I didn't kill her.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.329
I didn't kill Dani.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.679
But Professor Delaney did?

15:32.730 --> 15:34.095
Why'd you kill your lavwer,
Jeffrey?

15:34.130 --> 15:35.688
I don't think
that's been proved.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.391
Jeffrey, why did you shoot
at your own lavwer?

15:37.430 --> 15:39.967
I want to make clear, I have
been hired by the Grant family

15:40.000 --> 15:41.365
to represent
Jeffrey's interests.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.368
There's no evidence that
Jeffrey was the cause

15:43.410 --> 15:44.661
of Mr. Gardner's death.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.166
According to witnesses,

15:46.210 --> 15:48.303
there was a hail of gunfire
from other SWAT

15:48.340 --> 15:49.602
and sheriff members
on the scene,

15:49.640 --> 15:53.644
and the bullets that killed
Mr. Gardner may have...

15:53.680 --> 15:55.272
(sobbing)

15:55.320 --> 15:57.379
Gentlemen,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.388
let's step out
for a moment.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.388
(buzzer blares)

16:01.420 --> 16:03.354
(door opens, sobbing continues)

16:03.390 --> 16:06.279
I want to say my client
has been wrongly accused.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.399
(door closes)

16:07.430 --> 16:10.194
He was placed into a corner
by faulty DNA evidence

16:10.230 --> 16:11.322
of the Cook...

16:11.370 --> 16:15.033
Could you back up a bit?

16:15.070 --> 16:17.038
We anticipate a suit
against this jurisdiction.

16:17.070 --> 16:19.106
DETECTIVE: Your client killed
two people in that court.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.334
In a fit of
uncontrollable rage...

16:20.380 --> 16:21.404
He's not getting off.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.668
...by reason of insanity.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.349
Don't question my client
outside my presence.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.371
Kalinda, what are you thinking?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.486
(laughter)

16:30.520 --> 16:32.488
Uh, no, no, no.
All joking aside,

16:32.520 --> 16:35.318
Illinois only works

16:35.360 --> 16:37.419
if we can put aside
our differences

16:37.460 --> 16:38.654
and work together, everybody.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.397
I mean,
it's-it's really that simple.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.227
And that's what
I plan to do.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.329
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find out

16:45.370 --> 16:48.760
what Eli Gold meant
by changing my kids' diapers.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.165
(laughter)

16:50.210 --> 16:52.770
(applause)

16:53.780 --> 16:55.372
Eli, what's going on?

16:55.410 --> 16:56.434
You have to greet the press.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.368
No, you need to tell me
what's going on right now.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.502
If I tell you what's going on,

16:59.550 --> 17:00.676
you won't want to greet
the press.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.614
This is about Will?

17:04.620 --> 17:06.485
What?
This is about Will.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.488
No.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.158
What do you mean?

17:10.190 --> 17:12.329
Alicia's gonna talk to him
and convince him

17:12.360 --> 17:13.292
not to testify against me.

17:13.330 --> 17:15.150
Peter, I can tell you
quite definitively,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.451
Alicia is not gonna...

17:16.500 --> 17:18.491
Well...

17:19.500 --> 17:21.365
Will is dead.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.809
There was gunfire
at the courthouse.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.172
Will was shot
by a client.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.070
You have to talk
to the reporters.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.371
No, I have to...

17:34.420 --> 17:35.671
I have to call Alicia.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.709
I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.217
I need to speak to my wife.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.122
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:49.730 --> 17:51.721
(phone ringing)

17:55.200 --> 17:57.202
(ringing continues)

18:00.780 --> 18:02.509
This is Alicia Florrick.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.700
Please leave a message.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.757
(beeps)

18:16.790 --> 18:18.326
WILL:
Alicia.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.523
POLITI: Mr. Gardner,
we're just about ready here.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.266
WILL:
H-Hold on, Your Honor.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.494
I'll call you back.

18:28.170 --> 18:30.229
Mrs. Florrick.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.362
Yes.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.638
Your Honor,
do you have a moment?

18:32.670 --> 18:34.206
It's not, uh...

18:34.240 --> 18:35.776
I was about to go home.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.869
It's about Will.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.377
CARY:
We're just asking

18:39.410 --> 18:40.877
for a 48-hour delay.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.569
A delay in the deposition?

18:42.620 --> 18:44.281
Yes, there's been an emergency.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.412
The deposition

18:45.450 --> 18:46.644
that was already delayed?

18:46.690 --> 18:48.578
Yes, but that was
by another law firm.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.827
Alicia Florrick has had to deal
with a death close to her.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.499
Oh. Well, I'm sorry,

18:53.530 --> 18:55.395
but, uh,

18:55.430 --> 18:57.569
we're not giving you 48 hours.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.363
We have a window now.
Take it

18:59.400 --> 19:01.539
or wait another six months
to depose.

19:01.570 --> 19:02.764
Don't be a schmuck.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.506
Here's the thing,

19:04.540 --> 19:06.565
I am a schmuck.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.408
Tell her if she wants
to go to a funeral, go,

19:09.440 --> 19:10.543
but there's a price.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.275
Wait another six months
to depose,

19:12.310 --> 19:13.846
or, Candace,

19:13.880 --> 19:16.747
you could settle this
right now.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.884
Five cents on the dollar.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.911
What do you want to do?

19:22.920 --> 19:25.229
Let's do it right now.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.955
POLITI:
It was a recess.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.651
Mr. Gardner and Mr. Polmar

19:28.700 --> 19:30.429
thought they could reach
a plea bargain,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.597
so I recessed just before lunch.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.530
And you passed them in the hall?

19:34.570 --> 19:36.595
And Will was on his phone?

19:36.640 --> 19:38.528
Yeah.

19:38.570 --> 19:41.630
He left me a voice mail
on my phone.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.477
Mr. Polmar might know
what he was calling about.

19:43.510 --> 19:44.943
He was with him; I didn't hear.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.381
Yeah?

19:50.420 --> 19:52.513
What happened in court?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.478
Why do want to know,
Mrs. Florrick?

19:58.490 --> 20:01.220
(sighs)

20:08.970 --> 20:12.861
The accused got a gun
from the sheriff.

20:12.910 --> 20:16.539
We were at a sidebar
at the bench.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.674
He hit the witness,
killed him.

20:19.710 --> 20:22.645
Mr. Gardner tried to intervene

20:22.680 --> 20:25.979
and take the gun,
and he was hit next.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.588
Mr. Polmar covered him
with his body.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.349
Uh, Mr. Polmar?

20:31.390 --> 20:32.618
A.S.A. Polmar.

20:32.660 --> 20:34.992
He's new;
he was brought in from New York.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.895
He, uh, stayed with Will
the whole time,

20:36.930 --> 20:39.319
and he dragged him
over to the table.

20:39.370 --> 20:41.838
There was gunfire all over.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.861
The sheriffs were firing back
at the accused,

20:43.910 --> 20:45.662
and Mr. Polmar was shot

20:45.710 --> 20:48.736
dragging Will
out of the cross fire.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.549
Polmar stayed with him
the whole time?

20:52.580 --> 20:55.811
Yes,
till the paramedics arrived.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.784
He kept talking to him and...

20:57.820 --> 21:00.516
holding his hand.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.457
Do you know
what hospital he's at?

21:14.070 --> 21:16.459
ELI:
It's being noticed.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.829
(sighs)

21:18.870 --> 21:21.509
Let me use your phone.
Why?

21:21.540 --> 21:22.939
'Cause I'm the governor,

21:22.980 --> 21:25.904
and I'm asking
to use your phone.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.043
Show me how to dial Alicia.

21:29.050 --> 21:30.608
It won't mean anything.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.880
What? If she picks up your call
but not mine?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.309
That won't mean anything?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.825
(line ringing)

21:39.860 --> 21:41.851
(phone ringing)

21:47.840 --> 21:49.467
Eli, not now.

21:50.470 --> 21:53.371
No, it's not Eli.

21:53.410 --> 21:55.037
It's me.
I, uh, tried you on my phone.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.536
I couldn't reach you.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.447
Sorry.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.845
Um...

22:00.880 --> 22:02.370
I had my phone off.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.480
I-I just, I just
took it out now.

22:07.150 --> 22:09.516
I just called to tell you
that I'm sorry.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.357
I heard about Will.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.355
Thank you.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.122
Where are you?

22:19.170 --> 22:20.933
I'm at...

22:20.970 --> 22:22.767
Chicago General Hospital.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.358
Is that where he is?

22:24.410 --> 22:26.970
No, um, I don't...
I don't know where...

22:27.980 --> 22:30.369
Who's there? Diane?

22:30.410 --> 22:31.604
No, the prosecutor.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.642
Uh, he-he was... shot, too.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.511
That's terrible.

22:36.550 --> 22:37.812
Terrible.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.488
How long are you gonna be there?

22:39.520 --> 22:40.657
I don't know.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.987
Well, I-I'm gonna come to you.
No.

22:44.060 --> 22:46.028
Alicia, I'm coming to you.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.028
Peter,

22:48.060 --> 22:49.459
I'm fine.
Please, I-I'm fine.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.161
I'm your husband,
and I should be there.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.690
Yes, and you're the governor.

22:52.730 --> 22:53.833
Wherever you go,

22:53.870 --> 22:54.996
there's an entourage,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.837
and I can't deal with that
right now.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.935
Yeah, okay.

22:59.970 --> 23:02.939
You're right.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.107
I'm so sorry.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.141
Thank you.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.447
Good-bye.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.011
Is she all right?

23:16.020 --> 23:18.124
(sighs)

23:20.190 --> 23:22.055
You called Justice?

23:22.100 --> 23:24.466
You called Agent Dubeck
about a half hour ago?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.119
Yes.

23:27.170 --> 23:28.990
Don't.
Don't what? I'm just doing...

23:29.040 --> 23:30.962
No, you're not.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.705
This is about Will
being dead, right?

23:32.740 --> 23:34.469
And now that he's dead,

23:34.510 --> 23:36.671
Justice has no case
against me, right?

23:37.680 --> 23:38.999
Yes.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.974
Can we just take a minute?

23:43.020 --> 23:47.013
Can you just stop and not think
about the angles right now?

23:47.050 --> 23:49.018
Peter, don't scold me
for trying to protect you.

23:50.590 --> 23:53.024
You don't think I want
to be doing something else?

23:55.600 --> 23:58.068
Yeah, you're right.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.637
I apologize.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.069
What room is Finn Polmar in?

24:02.100 --> 24:03.032
(phone rings)

24:03.070 --> 24:05.004
Chicago General Hospital,
may I help you?

24:05.040 --> 24:06.905
WILL:
It was all a mistake.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.532
Can you believe it?
They thought it was me

24:08.580 --> 24:09.899
because the body
was shot in the face.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.508
(phone hangs up)

24:13.550 --> 24:15.939
Sorry, may I help you?

24:15.980 --> 24:19.017
Polmar. Finn Polmar's room.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.018
WOMAN:
You're looking for Finn?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.618
Yes.

24:22.660 --> 24:24.651
I'm Maria, his assistant.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.487
He's in surgery right now,

24:26.530 --> 24:28.122
but he should be
out pretty soon.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.889
You're...
Alicia Florrick.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.727
I just wanted to see
if he was all right.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.169
Mrs. Florrick.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.566
He's much better now, thanks.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.999
How do you know Finn?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.064
I...

24:38.110 --> 24:40.101
don't, really.

24:41.110 --> 24:42.907
I knew Will.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.168
Oh, my God, of course.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.040
I am sorry.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.914
It was so weird to
be with him today,

24:48.950 --> 24:50.110
and now this.

24:50.150 --> 24:51.845
You were in court?
No.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.188
In the, uh, plea bargain.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.023
Did Will...

24:59.060 --> 25:02.052
step out to make a call
in the middle

25:02.100 --> 25:03.897
of the plea bargain session?

25:03.930 --> 25:05.761
Yeah.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.994
He made a phone call?

25:07.030 --> 25:08.031
Yes.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.628
Do you know why?

25:09.670 --> 25:12.138
No, but it wasn't good.

25:12.170 --> 25:13.205
What do you mean?

25:13.240 --> 25:15.071
He was angry.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.031
Really pissed.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.071
Someone was stealing
his clients,

25:18.110 --> 25:19.873
and he was calling
them about it.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.639
I had to go out
and interrupt him.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.716
I-I told him that
Finn was ready.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.741
It was sad.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.021
Want me to tell Finn
you dropped by?

25:31.060 --> 25:32.220
No, that's all right.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.756
DAVID:
There's one problem.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.892
I called Bob Klepper.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.831
He wants to hear from you
before he considers staying.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.030
Oh, dear God.

25:42.070 --> 25:43.662
I wouldn't have bothered you
with this,

25:43.710 --> 25:44.802
but he's one of Will's...

25:44.840 --> 25:46.068
Top clients, I know.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.577
Hmm.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.177
I will see him tomorrow.

25:50.210 --> 25:53.247
He said today
or he'll start making calls.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.141
Do ever think we chose
the wrong profes5|on?

26:01.220 --> 26:03.154
I'll ask if he'll take a call.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.657
No, tell him to come in.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.257
That's what Will would do.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.120
SA'I'I'MANN: So this was all
an unfortunate misunderstanding,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.058
Dr. Levine?
Yes.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.239
I fired Candace
because of performance.

26:16.270 --> 26:17.191
That's all.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.798
SA'I'I'MANN:
Thank you, Doctor.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.137
Anything, Cary?

26:22.180 --> 26:23.204
Mr. Agos?

26:25.650 --> 26:27.914
When was the last time
you had sex With your Wife?

26:27.950 --> 26:29.042
Come on, Cary, relevance.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.638
The fine, upstanding doctor
said he was happily married,

26:30.690 --> 26:32.214
and that's why
he didn't fire my client

26:32.250 --> 26:33.182
because she was too pretty.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.780
I'm just examining
the truth of his contention.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.048
Nah, this is pure harassment.

26:37.090 --> 26:39.684
When was the last time you had
sex with your massage therapist?

26:39.730 --> 26:41.152
Okay, that's outrageous.
Are you serious?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.155
Totally irrelevant to the case.
Here's an affidavit

26:42.200 --> 26:43.690
from Beverly Jensen

26:43.730 --> 26:45.698
admitting you had sex
on five separate occasions.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.061
This deposition's over.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.260
Let's get the judge on the line.

26:48.300 --> 26:49.665
Dr. Levine has a patient,

26:49.700 --> 26:51.167
so we're gonna need
to delay this after all.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.802
You're the one
who went to the judge

26:52.840 --> 26:55.172
insisting the deposition
could only be today!

26:55.210 --> 26:57.132
So let's get the
judge on the line,

26:57.180 --> 26:59.239
but I don't think he's gonna be
in a giving mood!

27:02.420 --> 27:04.388
What do you want?

27:04.420 --> 27:06.741
I want to get out my aggressions
and my anger

27:06.790 --> 27:08.189
by destroying your client.

27:08.220 --> 27:11.326
Now sit down.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.696
I said sit the hell down.

27:44.490 --> 27:46.287
Hey, Jenna, Kalinda.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.924
I'm sorry about this.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.291
How many wounds?

27:50.330 --> 27:52.093
Three, all Glocks, G19.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.961
JENNA:
The same gun?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.297
No, don't know.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.207
G19 seems to be the
sheriff gun of choice.

27:58.240 --> 28:00.401
What's going on, Kalinda?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.375
We're trying to figure out
how Mr. Gardner died.

28:03.410 --> 28:05.708
Was it from Jeffrey Grant
or the cross fire?

28:05.750 --> 28:06.705
I'll have the report
out tomorrow.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.240
We don't want to wait.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.339
The bullet to the thorax
was the one that killed him.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.153
The other two shots,

28:14.190 --> 28:15.851
the one to the right shoulder
and the stomach,

28:15.890 --> 28:17.448
they were survivable.
It was the first.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.048
And who shot the first?

28:19.090 --> 28:20.387
Why?

28:20.430 --> 28:21.920
Because I want to know.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.261
The shot to the thorax
was from close range.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.359
Close range meant it came
from the accused,

28:29.400 --> 28:31.436
Jeffrey Grant.
JENNA: Okay, thanks.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.329
Let me see him.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.733
No need.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.338
I have the family coming in
for an ID.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.143
Kurt, just let me see him.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.889
*

29:16.380 --> 29:18.382
*

29:24.360 --> 29:25.918
(sighs)

29:25.960 --> 29:27.359
Hey, Kalinda?

29:27.390 --> 29:30.325
Jenna, just give me
a second, please.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.328
Yeah.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.531
(phone buzzing)

29:40.240 --> 29:41.332
Yeah?

29:41.380 --> 29:43.109
I'm going crazy.

29:44.110 --> 29:46.044
I know.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.173
I...

29:48.220 --> 29:50.472
I don't know
what to do, Kalinda.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.078
(sighs)

29:56.290 --> 29:57.928
I have to go.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.228
What are you gonna do?

30:02.230 --> 30:03.356
I don't know.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.325
It sounds like you do know.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.338
Don't worry.

30:09.370 --> 30:12.134
I'll see you later, Alicia.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.414
DAVID: Thank you,
Mr. Klepper, for coming in.

30:30.460 --> 30:34.055
You can understand this has been
a difficult day.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.192
I do.

30:35.230 --> 30:37.095
I loved Will.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.427
He was my lawyer
for eight years.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.062
Diane, how are you doing?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.533
Notgood.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.299
I'm sorry. Thank you

30:43.340 --> 30:46.161
for seeing me
on such short notice.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.303
Let me make something clear
up front.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.001
I want to stay,

30:50.040 --> 30:53.373
but with this _
product manufacturing lawswt,

30:53.410 --> 30:55.173
I need to know
where we stand.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.370
Well, Diane is best to talk
to then.
Good.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.910
So,

30:58.950 --> 31:00.144
you'll be able
to take over for Will.

31:00.190 --> 31:01.612
I will,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.457
but instead

31:03.490 --> 31:04.957
I'm going to fire you
as a client.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.249
What?

31:07.290 --> 31:08.450
You're no longer a client here.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.024
I'm not?

31:10.060 --> 31:11.459
You're not.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.929
Uh, I can go to Lake & Tordello.

31:14.970 --> 31:17.359
Yes, I know that;
that's why I talked to them.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.606
They won't take you.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.108
(chuckles)
They will.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.938
No. They don't like
the way you've... handled this.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.005
Florrick/Agos solicited me.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.574
Yes, I know,
and Ijust talked to Cary.

31:27.610 --> 31:28.577
He won't take you either.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.349
They liked Will.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.449
They don't like you.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.459
Okay.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.458
I'll give you
a few days

31:36.490 --> 31:38.026
and then we'll talk.
No, you're fired,
Mr. Klepper.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.381
You don't belong here anymore
as a client.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.092
We'll transfer your files
to your home.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.522
This is insane.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.395
Do you know
how much business

31:48.440 --> 31:50.396
I bring in here?
I do.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.965
That's what makes this
so difficult.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.675
It's not what Will would do.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.575
If I were dead,

31:57.610 --> 32:00.272
it's exactly what Will would do.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.511
(sighs)

32:07.550 --> 32:08.710
That felt good.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.910
Turned me on.

32:15.330 --> 32:17.127
GRACE:
Mom?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.525
(glass clinking)

32:18.570 --> 32:21.289
I'm so sorry.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.433
I know you don't believe it,

32:23.470 --> 32:27.463
but he's, um, he's with God.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.441
What does that mean, Grace?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.300
He's in Heaven

32:33.350 --> 32:35.545
with angels and clouds?

32:35.580 --> 32:37.571
I don't know.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.658
I, I don't think
you can really picture it.

32:41.690 --> 32:44.181
But you believe it?

32:47.160 --> 32:49.219
Why do you think
Will is in Heaven?

32:49.260 --> 32:51.694
He was a good person, wasn't he?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.539
He...

33:01.340 --> 33:03.433
He did some bad things,

33:03.480 --> 33:07.371
but he did them because...

33:07.410 --> 33:09.310
because he wanted to be good.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.489
Well, then he's in Heaven.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.011
I can't believe that, Grace.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.085
Why?

33:16.120 --> 33:18.122
(sighs)

33:21.830 --> 33:23.422
You think God is good?

33:23.460 --> 33:26.224
I don't find
any good here.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.295
A kid picked up a gun,

33:28.340 --> 33:31.434
didn't even mean
to shoot Will.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.665
It's just some stupid accident.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.338
(sniffles)

33:36.380 --> 33:39.076
What does... what does it mean?

33:43.250 --> 33:46.185
Well, what does it mean
if there is no God?

33:46.220 --> 33:49.348
Why is that any better?

33:49.390 --> 33:50.379
It's not better.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.819
It's just truer.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.452
(sighs)

33:53.490 --> 33:56.152
It's just not wishful thinking.

33:58.530 --> 34:01.829
Well, maybe always
believing the bad,

34:01.870 --> 34:04.509
maybe that's
wishful thinking, too.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.575
Mom,

34:12.610 --> 34:14.544
I just want you
to be happy.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.377
(sniffling)

34:16.420 --> 34:18.081
I will. I will eventually.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.111
(phone ringing)

34:22.490 --> 34:24.082
Okay, I have to get this.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.121
(clears throat)

34:27.130 --> 34:28.392
Hello.

34:28.430 --> 34:29.852
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.197
Yes.

34:31.230 --> 34:33.221
This is Finn Polmar.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.198
Oh, uh, yes.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.437
Uh, a bit loopy.

34:40.470 --> 34:41.869
The painkillers...

34:41.910 --> 34:45.277
Uh, Maria said you wanted
to talk to me

34:45.310 --> 34:46.299
about Will,

34:46.350 --> 34:48.739
about our last conversation.

34:48.780 --> 34:51.146
Yes, but that can wait
till tomorrow.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.487
Well, why tomorrow?

34:52.520 --> 34:54.511
I'm up all night.

35:06.530 --> 35:08.532
(footsteps approaching)

35:09.900 --> 35:11.800
What do you need, Jenna?

35:12.940 --> 35:14.578
JENNA:
Uh, just stretching my legs.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.475
What about you?
Why do they got you here?

35:16.510 --> 35:18.148
Suicide watch.

35:18.180 --> 35:19.204
Every 30 minutes.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.309
Kid who shot up the court?
Yeah.

35:21.350 --> 35:22.669
Watching anybody else?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.711
A few cells at
the other end.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.352
Why don't you go take a look?

35:30.890 --> 35:32.187
It's my responsibility.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.857
Now it's mine.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.199
Why'd you do it?

35:57.320 --> 35:59.288
You killed my friend.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.652
I didn't mean to.

36:01.690 --> 36:02.952
You shot him.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.527
You didn't mean to,
but you shot him.

36:11.530 --> 36:13.498
You want to die?

36:18.710 --> 36:20.302
I have your belt.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.271
I took it from Property.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.380
The guard will be away
for ten minutes.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.615
That'll give you enough time.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.406
What are you doing?

37:01.720 --> 37:04.609
No, you're gonna
live with this.

37:04.650 --> 37:08.313
You know Will was a good man,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.282
and I loved him,

37:10.320 --> 37:12.424
and he was trying
to help you.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.851
So you live with that.

37:19.330 --> 37:20.763
No.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.961
No, no, no, no, please.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.262
No.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.266
(whimpering):
Please.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.278
(knocking)

37:37.320 --> 37:38.742
Hi.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.280
Hi.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.857
I'm Finn.

37:42.890 --> 37:43.959
Alicia.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.548
I guessed.

37:45.590 --> 37:48.423
I would ask you to sit,
but I am in the only chair.

37:48.460 --> 37:50.928
No, no, you can sit on the bed.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.962
(chuckles)
No, I'm fine.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.798
Are you in pain?

37:55.840 --> 37:56.989
Well, not tonight,

37:57.040 --> 37:58.905
_but tomorrow
Will be interesting.

37:58.940 --> 38:00.362
(chuckles)

38:00.410 --> 38:02.332
(sighs)

38:02.380 --> 38:03.438
Sorry, the painkillers...

38:03.480 --> 38:05.368
Oh, no, don't-don't be sorry.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.340
You're reading Cicero?

38:10.380 --> 38:12.689
No, no, that was a-a joke
from my assistant.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.859
I have no idea What it means,

38:14.890 --> 38:16.380
but I will be
asking her

38:16.420 --> 38:17.887
tomorrow.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.353
(groans)

38:19.390 --> 38:21.426
Uh-oh.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.697
No, we're good.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.893
Um, so, uh...

38:27.930 --> 38:29.466
you knew Will.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.637
I did.

38:30.670 --> 38:32.433
I liked him.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.062
I liked him a lot.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.937
He-he really had me
at the trial.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.470
(chuckles)

38:39.510 --> 38:42.070
I was losing.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.384
I heard you tried to save him.

38:44.420 --> 38:47.082
Yes, that wasn't too smart,
was it?

38:48.090 --> 38:50.058
Thank you.

38:50.090 --> 38:52.979
Yeah, he kept, um...

38:54.830 --> 38:56.058
I don't know.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.989
Uh, could, uh...

38:59.030 --> 39:00.566
Could you pass me the water?

39:05.540 --> 39:07.531
I thank you.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.368
Yeah, he, uh,

39:11.410 --> 39:14.049
he kept moving his lips

39:14.080 --> 39:15.570
like he wanted to talk.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.145
I was right over him,

39:18.180 --> 39:20.045
and he was staring up at me,

39:20.090 --> 39:22.911
and he kept...

39:22.960 --> 39:24.518
opening his mouth.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.427
I don't know, maybe he
didn't see me there.

39:27.460 --> 39:29.792
I don't know.

39:29.830 --> 39:32.390
IfI start making sense,
will you tell me?

39:32.430 --> 39:34.466
You're making sense.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.058
Thank you.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.933
And he...

39:38.970 --> 39:40.107
reached up.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.698
He could still move his hand,

39:41.740 --> 39:43.002
and he grabbed mine.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.042
I asked him if he
was all right,

39:45.080 --> 39:48.618
and he just kept
holding my hand,

39:48.650 --> 39:50.971
kept squeezing it,

39:51.020 --> 39:54.717
While we were waiting
for the paramedics to arrive.

39:56.090 --> 39:58.979
It's really pretty
awful, isn't it?

39:59.030 --> 40:01.021
Yes.

40:06.870 --> 40:10.033
Uh, Maria said that he was angry

40:10.070 --> 40:11.833
during the plea
bargaining session,

40:11.870 --> 40:13.758
that he stepped out
to make a phone call.

40:13.810 --> 40:14.879
Uh, yes.

40:14.910 --> 40:18.129
Uh, some guy

40:18.180 --> 40:18.976
he needed to find.

40:19.010 --> 40:20.671
Some guy?

40:20.710 --> 40:23.213
Damian...

40:23.250 --> 40:24.547
something.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.581
He, uh, he stole
some clients.

40:28.090 --> 40:30.513
I'd offer you a chair,
I really would, but...

40:30.560 --> 40:32.027
No, no, I'm fine.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.482
You want food? There's food.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.455
No, I'm-I'm good.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.458
Will called me at 11:30,

40:44.510 --> 40:46.808
just before
your bargaining session.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.738
(sighs)

40:52.780 --> 40:55.010
Do you know Why?

40:55.050 --> 40:57.109
No.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.845
He didn't say anything?

40:58.890 --> 41:00.881
No.

41:02.890 --> 41:05.779
I had some pictures
on my phone.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.923
My Wife, my son.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.052
He asked me about them.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.028
What did he ask?

41:12.070 --> 41:14.061
Their names.

41:19.140 --> 41:21.131
Oh.

41:21.170 --> 41:22.603
You should get to bed.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.540
I really should,
shouldn't I?

41:24.580 --> 41:26.104
Could you tell
the nurse?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.141
Yes.

41:29.150 --> 41:31.618
Thank you, Finn.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.948
I wanted to tell you something.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.552
What?

41:36.590 --> 41:38.080
Oh.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.680
I'm sorry.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.151
I really am.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.719
Are you all right?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.527
I don't know.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.537
(sighs)

42:27.940 --> 42:29.931
I'm really sorry
about Will.

42:33.950 --> 42:35.941
I know.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.318
(phone beeps)

42:51.360 --> 42:53.066
WILL:
Alicia, I'm sorry.

42:53.100 --> 42:55.091
I want What we had.

42:56.870 --> 42:58.838
I want to be with you...

42:58.870 --> 43:01.930
and only you.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.971
Forever.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.048
Call me back, please.
