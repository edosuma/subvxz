WEBVTT

00:04.138 --> 00:06.005
This is pretty
hefty punishment

00:06.007 --> 00:08.207
for breaking one measly chimney.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.677
Hey, ALF. Watch this.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.215
Interesting.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.983
(Brian)
'It's a dog.'

00:17.985 --> 00:21.253
I could see that,
but it wrecked your stick trick.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.989
What was supposed to happen?

00:23.991 --> 00:26.091
That was it.
That's how you play fetch.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.862
Fascinating game.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.797
Right up there
with watching golf.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.633
You wanna throw one?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.368
Alright. What harm could it do?

00:43.210 --> 00:44.410
[glass shattering]

00:44.412 --> 00:46.145
[gasps]

00:50.184 --> 00:52.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.822
Uh, what are the chances
that the crash I just heard

00:56.824 --> 00:59.758
was the Ochmoneks
breaking their own window?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.561
Slim and none.
And slim is out of town.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.398
Where did this dog come from?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.401
She followed me home
from school.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.270
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner!'

01:11.272 --> 01:16.341
ALF, you-you better hide whilst
I, once again, take the blame

01:16.343 --> 01:17.910
for something you did.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.345
Thanks, Willie.
You're a prince.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.415
I'm a king.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.086
Good afternoon, guys.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.787
Uh, does this look
familiar to anyone?

01:28.789 --> 01:31.390
Oh, gee, I'm-I'm sorry, Trevor.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.225
B-Brian and I were..

01:33.227 --> 01:35.928
...uh, we were just,
sort of...play..

01:35.930 --> 01:37.796
- It's twenty dollars, right?
- Eighty.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.767
Eighty dollars?

01:41.769 --> 01:44.803
Yeah, I'm putting
in Plexiglas this time.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.139
It'll be cheaper for you
in the long run.

01:48.109 --> 01:50.209
- Good planning.
- Thanks.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.211
- 'Well, I'll see ya.'
- 'So long, Trevor.'

01:54.415 --> 01:58.217
- Uh, she sure is a pretty dog.
- Can we keep her?

01:58.219 --> 02:00.619
Yeah, Willie. Can we, huh?

02:00.621 --> 02:03.455
No. I-I-I don't know.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.658
I-I'm sure she's got
an owner somewhere.

02:06.660 --> 02:10.162
Can't we just keep her
until we find the owner?

02:10.164 --> 02:13.799
Well, I-I guess so, as long, as
long as it's okay with your mom.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.435
Oh, goody, goody,
goody, goody, goody!

02:16.437 --> 02:18.470
I didn't know you liked dogs.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
What's not to like?

02:20.407 --> 02:24.176
They are loyal, obedient.
They hate cats.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.312
[growling]

02:28.249 --> 02:30.015
And those who eat them.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.585
Down, boy. Down.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.490
[theme music]

[no audio]

03:58.572 --> 04:00.005
Hi, there.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.341
Gordon Shumway.
Nice to meet you.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.743
Interested in a new Buick?

04:04.745 --> 04:05.978
Nice try.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.383
Wait a minute.
One of these steaks is missing.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.585
- ALF!
- No, no. I didn't. Honest.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.221
I looked,
but I didn't touch.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.790
Well, you did so touch!

04:18.792 --> 04:22.194
Alright, I touched,
but I didn't eat.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.962
And I'm supposed to believe
one of these steaks

04:23.964 --> 04:26.431
just got up
and walked away on it's own?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.501
I've seen stranger.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.405
That's it, ALF.
No dinner for you tonight.

04:33.407 --> 04:37.309
But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.513
Well, I did eat that pumpkin.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.817
Anyone lose a steak?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.919
[coughing]

04:47.921 --> 04:51.056
O-o-okay, ALF.
I'm sorry I accused you.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.393
Apology accepted.

04:54.395 --> 04:58.030
I'd hate to be in your paws,
you cattle rustler!

05:00.134 --> 05:02.134
Bad dog!

05:02.136 --> 05:05.904
Oh, I didn't mean it.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.673
No, she didn't mean it.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.740
- Oh.
- Here.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.509
You're a good dog, aren't you?

05:10.511 --> 05:11.777
Yes, you are.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.413
Come on, pup. Come on.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.682
[imitating Lynn]
You're a good dog. Yes, you are.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.686
This is an outrage!

05:20.688 --> 05:23.922
That dog should be flogged on
the quarterdeck.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.425
Whatever that means.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.528
Oh, ALF, she's just a dog.
She doesn't know any better.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.331
Ignorance is no excuse.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.200
Ignorance is your excuse
all the time.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.738
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.443
Okay, watch this.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.911
Speak.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.748
[laughing]

05:51.352 --> 05:54.786
Okay. Okay. Sit.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.321
Oh.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.856
That is so cute!

05:57.858 --> 06:00.525
Talk about stupid pet tricks.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.861
Letterman would have
a field day with this one.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.501
Well, I put up a bunch
of those dumb posters.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.204
I still hope nobody
claims Alfina.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.039
- Alfina?
- Oh!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.608
Don't you just<i> hate</i> that name?

06:17.644 --> 06:19.311
What a good girl!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.848
Canine kiss up.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.384
I still think
we should offer a reward

06:25.386 --> 06:28.253
to anyone who claims that dog.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.223
You don't offer a reward
when you find a dog.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.892
You offer a reward
when you lose a dog.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.195
Okay, I'll give you
five bucks to lose Alfina.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.064
- ALF!
- Kidding!

06:39.066 --> 06:40.732
I'm a funny alien.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.201
[sarcastic laugh]

06:43.203 --> 06:44.603
[doorbell dings]

06:45.439 --> 06:47.506
I know the routine.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.508
Exit stage right.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.752
- Where is he?
- Where's who?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.788
My dog. That's who.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.723
You found him, didn't you?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.024
Well, yes, we did.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.693
I mean, that is to say
we found a dog.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.797
He's mine. Where is he?

07:13.066 --> 07:16.535
It's not a he.
She's a she.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.404
I knew that.
Is that her?

07:19.406 --> 07:23.074
- Don't you recognize her?
- Of course, I do.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.476
Come here, dog!

07:24.478 --> 07:25.677
[growling]

07:28.148 --> 07:31.483
She doesn't seem
to be responding to you.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.119
We had a fight!
She'll get over it.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.056
Uh, do you suppose

07:38.058 --> 07:41.393
and, uh, mind you,
this is just a thought..

07:41.395 --> 07:45.263
...that you might be mistaken
about this being your dog?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.399
I lost a dog.
You found a dog.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.168
Can we do business or not?

07:51.271 --> 07:52.804
I think not.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.011
Here's my address
and telephone number

08:00.013 --> 08:01.646
in case you change your mind.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.914
Okay.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.352
Have a nice day!

08:13.260 --> 08:15.126
I'm glad
you're not her dog.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.428
Yeah. Me too.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.331
Could I take Alfina for a walk?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.532
Sure, honey.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.367
Watchout for that dragon lady.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.803
Come on, Alfina.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.939
Isn't that a picture.
A boy and his dog.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.610
And the alien he left behind.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.845
[dramatic music]

08:35.716 --> 08:37.782
[ALF whining]

08:40.387 --> 08:43.388
[whining]

08:47.160 --> 08:48.393
[whining]

08:50.964 --> 08:52.998
ALF..

08:53.000 --> 08:54.599
...why did you do that?

08:55.903 --> 08:58.837
Well, I could have
licked your hand

08:58.839 --> 09:01.139
but I didn't think
either of us would enjoy that.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.210
Well, you're right. I much
prefer a blow to the head.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.646
As you wish, master.

09:11.485 --> 09:12.484
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.886
Thank you.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.022
I'll read that when I get up..

09:17.024 --> 09:18.156
...in three hours.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.760
What are you two doing?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.428
ALF thinks he's a dog.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.231
Apparently,
dogs can't tell time.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.035
Actually, we can,
but we have so few appointments

09:30.037 --> 09:31.770
why bother?

09:33.607 --> 09:36.341
ALF, you're not a dog.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.910
Well, I wish I were a dog.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.214
Dogs get treated better
than aliens around here.

09:43.216 --> 09:49.020
That's because dogs behave
better than aliens around here.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.290
I'll change.
You'll see.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.761
I'll-I'll heal. I'll fetch.
I'll play dead.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.197
Could we discuss this
in the morning?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.566
But I am great at playing dead.

10:01.568 --> 10:05.737
I was Camille
in my high school play.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.873
I feel weak.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.011
[coughs]

10:26.259 --> 10:28.860
Is nothing sacred?
Out of my bed!

10:30.597 --> 10:34.466
You come in here, stick your
big snout into everything.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.068
Take over the house,
eat all the food.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.537
That's my job.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.342
How would you feel
about relocating?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.078
[growls]

10:47.080 --> 10:49.047
I'll take that as a yes.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.759
- Tomatoes?
- Uh, over here.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.495
Thank you. Oregano?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.430
- Where you left it.
- Thank you.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.266
- Oh. Whipped cream?
- Coming at you.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.602
[yawns]

11:10.604 --> 11:11.936
Morning!

11:11.938 --> 11:14.639
- Oh, morning, ALF.
- I smell food.

11:14.641 --> 11:16.041
And lots of it.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.509
What's cooking?

11:17.511 --> 11:20.779
Oh, your all-time favorite
Sunday breakfast.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.414
Cats Benedict?

11:23.784 --> 11:27.385
No. French toast, Jell-O
and spaghetti.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.689
[sniffs]

11:30.691 --> 11:34.459
Ah, Christmas came early
this year.

11:34.461 --> 11:38.029
Well, actually, we-we felt like
we kinda owed you an apology.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
Well, I agree. What for?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.300
Well, for neglecting you

11:42.302 --> 11:45.370
and spending
all our time with Alfina.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.706
Speaking of Alfina,
where is she?

11:47.708 --> 11:49.074
Yeah, you know,
she always comes

11:49.076 --> 11:50.542
running when
there's food cooking.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.410
Yeah. ALF, you haven't
seen her, have you?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.548
Check, please.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.752
What have you done?

12:00.754 --> 12:04.789
Oh, sure. Just assume
that I gave Alfina away.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.727
You gave away Alfina?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.829
[doorbell dings]

12:10.831 --> 12:12.464
Saved by the bell.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.834
You stay right
where you are, mister.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.407
This doesn't have the feel
of your typical happy ending.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.212
Hi, can I help you?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.913
I came to get my dog.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.684
Oh, okay, come on in.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.921
This is her.
This is my dog, Francesca.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.958
Can I have her back, please?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.060
- Sure.
- Oh, uh, no, wait.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.962
Um, before we give her to you

12:43.964 --> 12:46.131
we have to make sure
she is your dog.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.133
Oh, she's my dog, alright.

12:48.135 --> 12:52.303
She's brown and white and
shaggy, and she does tricks.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.573
- What kind of tricks?
- The wrong tricks.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.575
Like, when I tell her
to sit up and beg

12:57.577 --> 12:59.177
she rolls over and plays dead.

13:00.547 --> 13:01.546
That's her, alright.

13:03.583 --> 13:07.185
My dad taught her that.
He has a weird sense of humor.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.089
I can't find Alfina anywhere.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.791
Who's Alfina?

13:12.793 --> 13:15.927
Oh, we have a little problem.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.263
- Uh..
- Hannah.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.165
Hannah.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.833
I'm Mr. Tanner.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.302
- This is my wife, Mrs. Tanner.
- Hello.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.505
And these are the Tanner
siblings, Brian, Lynn.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.973
Hi.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.510
Um, Hannah is here
to pick up her dog.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.245
Uh-oh.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.748
Where is she?

13:38.285 --> 13:40.451
Actually, we don't know
where she is

13:40.453 --> 13:42.120
just at the moment.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.657
Oh, no. I have to sit down.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.192
Oh, please.

13:48.995 --> 13:53.031
You know, we did find your dog.
I mean, Brian found your dog.

13:53.033 --> 13:57.535
It's just that she seems
to have...wandered off.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.171
We just moved to
this neighborhood

14:00.173 --> 14:02.974
And Francesca is the only friend
I have here.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.643
Oh, Hannah. No, don't cry.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.980
We'll help you find your dog.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.815
And if we can't..

14:10.817 --> 14:13.117
...I can think
of a suitable replacement.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.990
ALF.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.391
Hold on, Willie.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.393
I'm trying to find
the right quotation

14:22.395 --> 14:24.829
to express my regret.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.065
This one seems apropos.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.000
"To err is human."

14:29.002 --> 14:32.837
You got rid of that dog,
didn't you?

14:32.839 --> 14:35.573
You're right.
The buck stops here.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.610
"Admiral John Poindexter, 1987."

14:42.349 --> 14:45.516
Where is the dog, ALF?

14:45.518 --> 14:47.719
I thought Brian
was getting too attached

14:47.721 --> 14:49.420
to the little mutt.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.423
That's not for you to decide.
I'm in charge here.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.394
Oh, uh,
"General Alexander Haig, 1981."

14:58.598 --> 15:02.333
ALF, what have you done
with the dog?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.535
Hey, hey, don't worry.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.772
I called that nice lady
who said she was the owner.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.941
She picked Alfina up last night.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.176
Oh, ALF.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.545
It was obvious to anyone

15:14.547 --> 15:18.883
that woman never laid eyes
on Alfina in her life!

15:18.885 --> 15:22.186
Well, she sure had me fooled!

15:22.188 --> 15:24.255
"Gary Hart, 1987."

15:26.126 --> 15:27.926
[instrumental music]

15:32.232 --> 15:33.264
[knock on door]

15:33.266 --> 15:34.299
[growls]

15:34.301 --> 15:36.134
Shut up, you mutt.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.369
[knocking continues]

15:38.371 --> 15:40.538
I'm coming! I'm coming.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.973
Keep your pants on.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.246
Oh, it's you.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.548
Oh, I-I-I'm sorry,
Mrs. Buttonwood

15:50.550 --> 15:52.450
I-I hope I'm not disturbing you.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.454
But it didn't bother you when
you phoned at 4:00 this morning

15:56.456 --> 15:59.724
Oh, that-that I-I-I am sorry.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.460
Forget it. It gave me a chance
to shave my legs.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.497
Step inside, Tanner.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.132
You're letting
all the flies out.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.235
(Willie)
'Hey-hey, hey.'

16:11.905 --> 16:13.805
Alfina.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.841
Hey, how you doing, girl?

16:16.843 --> 16:19.577
You know, Mrs. Buttonwood,
I-I-I'd really

16:19.579 --> 16:21.646
I'd really like
to have her back.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.681
I'd like
to be Christie Brinkley.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.017
You learn to live with it.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.354
But the dog's real owner
came by today

16:29.356 --> 16:33.324
and she, she would love
to have her back.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.326
She can have her back.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.495
- Great.
- For 500 bucks.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.834
- Five hundred?
- Bucks!

16:42.836 --> 16:44.535
You have a hearing problem?

16:46.873 --> 16:51.876
But the dog's real owner
is-is a little girl.

16:51.878 --> 16:55.480
And-and she misses her so much.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.449
You know, she was crying
in my living room.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.886
Aw. Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.690
Five hundred bucks!

17:05.692 --> 17:08.159
- Will you take a check?
- Cash!

17:08.161 --> 17:09.560
Cash.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.862
You can't be too careful.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.864
There's a lot
of slime out there.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.932
I hear you.

17:16.503 --> 17:20.238
You know,
I don't have $500 cash on me.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.572
[knocking on door]

17:21.574 --> 17:23.341
(male #1)
'Ethel! Open up!'

17:23.343 --> 17:25.877
My ex-boyfriend, that is,
if he ain't short of a dollar

17:25.879 --> 17:27.578
and jealous to the bone.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.850
Just a minute, honey.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.153
I'm not dressed yet.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.389
(male #1)
'Ethel! You got a man in there?'

17:38.391 --> 17:40.691
Maybe there is!

17:40.693 --> 17:44.762
You better get out of here while
your face is still in the front.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.897
But I..

17:45.899 --> 17:47.865
I haven't done anything.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.867
I'll give you a rain check.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.536
[knocking continues]

17:51.538 --> 17:53.938
Climb out that window.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.773
Oh, that's silly!

17:55.775 --> 17:58.242
[pounding on door]

17:58.244 --> 18:01.779
- Is there a backdoor?
- It's all boarded up.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.782
Vince threw the mailman
through it last week.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.317
[knocking on door]

18:09.956 --> 18:11.923
Oh, suddenly, that looks
like quite a drop!

18:11.925 --> 18:14.459
- Don't be a wuss.
- Stop!

18:14.461 --> 18:15.860
[thud]

18:15.862 --> 18:17.662
[instrumental music]

18:21.434 --> 18:25.036
Why did you give Alfina
to that mean lady, ALF?

18:25.038 --> 18:28.072
Look, B, like we said on Melmac

18:28.074 --> 18:31.109
"If you love something
set it free.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.711
"If it comes back
to you it is yours.

18:33.713 --> 18:38.216
If it gets run over by a car
you don't want it."

18:38.218 --> 18:40.451
Thanks a lot, ALF.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.053
Sorry.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.889
Hey, hey, let's go
shoot some hoops.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.624
I'll get the peashooter

18:46.626 --> 18:48.793
you see if the hoops
are in their backyard.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.630
I'm not playing with you
anymore, ever!

18:53.666 --> 18:55.199
[door opens]

18:56.836 --> 18:59.103
Dad, where's Alfina?

18:59.105 --> 19:01.139
I'm, I'm sorry, Brian.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.242
I couldn't get her back.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.010
Why not?

19:06.012 --> 19:09.747
Well, apparently, Ms. Buttonwood
only wanted the dog

19:09.749 --> 19:13.885
so she could get $500
from the real owner.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.722
It's all your fault, ALF!

19:20.860 --> 19:23.761
He's right.
I got us into this.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.129
I'll get us out.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.498
Willie, can I borrow $500?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.901
I'll give it back
to you next payday.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.504
You don't have a job, ALF.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.507
I meant your next payday.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.511
You'll stay out of this.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.580
You're in enough hot water!

19:44.951 --> 19:47.018
So what's a little more?

19:51.824 --> 19:54.091
Hey, mutt, move it or lose it.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.965
[telephone ringing]

20:03.703 --> 20:05.803
Never fails.

20:05.805 --> 20:09.240
Sit down to a nice home-cooked
meal and the phone rings.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.378
I'm coming! I'm coming!

20:16.015 --> 20:17.381
[ringing continues]

20:21.254 --> 20:24.522
[whispers]
Psst! Psst! Alfina.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.892
Alfina. It's me, ALF.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.894
I've come to rescue you.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.596
(Ethel)
'Hey, dog.'

20:31.598 --> 20:34.165
'You touch that TV dinner,
you're cheese spread.'

20:36.102 --> 20:39.904
Uh, we could throw water on her
and watch her melt

20:39.906 --> 20:41.672
but we're short on time.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.609
[knocking on door]

20:44.611 --> 20:46.077
Oh, great.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.548
I need a doorman.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.916
[knocking continues]

20:51.918 --> 20:53.818
Hold your horses!

20:56.222 --> 20:57.455
Hello, sweetheart.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.789
Vince, I told you
never to show

20:58.791 --> 21:01.125
your jealous puss
around here again.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.361
Well, that's what
I've come to tell you.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.965
I'm not jealous anymore,
twinkle toes.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.969
I'm in group therapy
with a bunch of Italian guys.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.939
You did all that just for me,
stud-muffin?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.708
Stud-muffin?

21:17.710 --> 21:21.746
But you only call me
that when you wanna.. Oh-oh!

21:21.748 --> 21:24.015
Shut up,
and go get the mood music.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.853
(Vince)
'The-the "LP" or the "45?"'

21:29.922 --> 21:31.422
"The LP."

21:31.424 --> 21:32.723
Alright!

21:32.725 --> 21:34.458
[laughing]

21:38.831 --> 21:40.831
[dramatic music]

21:45.905 --> 21:47.104
Come on, pooch.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.173
We don't wanna stick around
for this.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.844
[Ethel laughing]

21:53.846 --> 21:54.979
[Vince laughing]

21:57.150 --> 22:00.851
No. Some things are best left
to the imagination.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.021
Ewweee!

22:11.998 --> 22:13.030
[instrumental music]

22:15.601 --> 22:19.437
One last time.
Okay, Francesca, speak.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.708
[all cheering]

22:24.977 --> 22:28.045
The dog is phenomenal.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.381
I should tell my parents
I found her.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.583
Wave buh-bye,
Francesca.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.290
Phenomenal.

22:39.292 --> 22:40.558
Goodbye, Hanna.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.460
Goodbye, Francesca.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.628
Hey, you can come play with us
if you want to.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.697
- Can I?
- Oh, sure, honey. Have fun.

22:46.699 --> 22:51.469
Let's go.

22:51.471 --> 22:55.373
Oh, they look kinda
look cute together, don't they?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.810
I can't help it, I'm a mother.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.314
She should wear flats.

23:05.418 --> 23:08.519
You know, I am kinda
proud of Brian though.

23:08.521 --> 23:11.989
The way he was able to give up
that dog without any fuss.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.023
Yeah.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.493
What about yours truly?

23:15.495 --> 23:17.328
What about him?

23:17.330 --> 23:20.731
Valiantly risking my life
behind enemy lines

23:20.733 --> 23:25.936
to reunite a girl and her dog
where others had failed before?

23:25.938 --> 23:27.905
Notably you, Wilheim.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.276
We get the point, ALFheim.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.711
Yes, yes.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.546
This time..

23:35.548 --> 23:38.182
...you did manage
to do the right thing.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.986
[whimpers]

23:43.356 --> 23:44.989
[theme music]

24:10.650 --> 24:12.049
[ALF screaming]
