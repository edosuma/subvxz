that Agora make sure

03:03.934 --> 03:05.935

07:45.048 --> 07:47.951
Just before Agora fired me last year,

07:48.051 --> 07:50.052
I went out with them to the Black Sea.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.721
We found something.

do not ask him how much
he's going to invest in this.

Sir, this is Robinson,
the man I told you about.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.501

are you going to invest in this?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.128
(SIGHS)

09:13.136 --> 09:15.539
DANIELS: So, in 1941,

09:15.639 --> 09:18.766
Nazi Germany came close
to total financial collapse.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.045
At that time, the Soviets were neutral,

09:22.145 --> 09:25.715
but Stalin was terrified
that Germany was going to invade,

09:25.815 --> 09:29.818
so Hitler used this and demanded
a loan from Russia.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.823
80 million reichsmark in gold.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.227
Now, nobody knows what happens next

09:37.327 --> 09:38.395
because weeks later,

09:38.495 --> 09:41.872
Hitler broke the nonaggression
pact and invaded Russia.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.000
Four years of war, 20 million dead.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.337
But in the '50s there's rumors
that started to circulate

09:48.463 --> 09:50.115
in the highest ranks of the Politburo

09:50.215 --> 09:53.175
that Stalin had complied
with the request,

09:53.343 --> 09:54.744
that Hitler had sent a U-boat,

09:54.844 --> 09:58.915
Stalin had stuffed it with two tons
of gold and sent it on its way.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.725
But the gold never arrived,
and Hitler invaded.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.588
- So...
- So everybody forgets about it.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.424
But in the '80s,
an oceanic research institute

10:07.524 --> 10:10.526
found a series of shallow
ridges off the Georgian coast.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.696
I worked for a company
called Agora Marine Management.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.141
They search for and salvage wrecks.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.269
They found a U-boat
on one of these ridges,

10:19.369 --> 10:22.162
just 90 meters from the surface.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.039
That's reachable.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.543
DANIELS: Mr. Lewis,
they think it's the one.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.879
In 2008 they took this information
to the Georgian government

10:31.339 --> 10:35.050
and they offered them a deal.
The Georgians agreed.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.385
LEWIS: And?

10:36.511 --> 10:39.122
DANIELS: And a month later, there was
the Russian-Georgian conflict.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.666
Borders shifted, and the ownership
of those waters

10:41.766 --> 10:43.726
has been in dispute ever since.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.129
The Russians don't even
know the sub's there,

10:46.229 --> 10:48.340
the Georgians know,
but not its exact location,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.899
and Agora can't go in
till the dispute's settled.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.136
I mean, they're tied up in paperwork
and fucking politics.

10:53.236 --> 10:57.865
Meanwhile that submarine
is just sitting on the seabed,

10:59.242 --> 11:00.868
full of gold.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.414
What is it you want from me?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.086
I need a submarine.

11:11.921 --> 11:16.050
Blackie here has contacts
in Sevastopol, but it will cost.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.427
180,000.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.331
And men. I need men.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.098
Half British, half Russian.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.269
It's a Russian sub,
so they'll need Russians.

11:33.276 --> 11:37.112
I'll take 40% of anything
up to $40 million,

11:37.238 --> 11:39.281
20% of anything above that.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.075

11:45.288 --> 11:46.622

11:54.798 --> 11:57.701

11:57.801 --> 11:58.926

12:00.470 --> 12:02.679

12:03.473 --> 12:05.474
BLACKIE: It's a Foxtrot-class sub.

You want boat move,
need 12 men minimum.

12:09.270 --> 12:14.858
