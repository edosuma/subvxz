09:57.664 --> 09:59.532
Oh, my goodness.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.335
Pop the corn
and feed the children.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.537
[all laugh]

10:04.537 --> 10:06.439
What a way to start the show.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.041
Let's go to the judges

10:08.041 --> 10:10.076
and find out
what they have to say.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.144
Michelle Visage.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.513
Poppy, you surprised me.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.049
-Thank you.
-I was watching you,

10:16.049 --> 10:18.618
and you fully gave into it.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.521
And that's not easy to do
in dancing shoes,

10:21.521 --> 10:22.989
so when you go ahead
and put on heels

10:22.989 --> 10:24.491
if you're not used
to being in them--

10:24.491 --> 10:25.959
Which I'm not.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.460
And tucked and corseted,

10:27.460 --> 10:28.828
all that stuff is not easy,

10:28.828 --> 10:30.830
and you went full throttle.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.265
That was impressive, Poppy.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.100
Thank you.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.036
All right. Let's move on down
to Carson Kressley.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.805
I have to remind myself

10:38.805 --> 10:41.841
this person's not even
a professional drag queen.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.476
I loved every second of that.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.145
-It was very satisfying.
-Thank you so much.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.213
Thank you.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.549
You know, I just wanna
spend a moment

10:49.549 --> 10:52.619
on your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and tuck

10:52.619 --> 10:55.121
for a second,

10:55.121 --> 10:56.489
because it's on point.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.724
Well, thank you.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.325
Usually, when
a performer's on stage,

10:59.325 --> 11:03.162
I try to sneak a peek
at the dancers.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.865
I never once snuck a peek
at the dancers

11:05.865 --> 11:07.100
while you were on stage.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.401
You're so captivating.

11:08.401 --> 11:09.736
Wow. Thank you.

11:09.736 --> 11:12.105
All right, everybody give it up
for Poppy Love.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.675

Tonight, category is I'm Coming
Out
First Time In Drag.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.066
Now let's get metaphysical

11:40.066 --> 11:42.168
and meet our next queen.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.571
[cheers and applause]

11:44.571 --> 11:47.807
I've been watching
Drag Race forever.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.510
I grew up listening
to RuPaul's songs.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.879
But I've been performing
since I was a little girl.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.380
People have always
known who I am.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.448
Like, I can't hide,

11:55.448 --> 11:57.350
so assuming a new identity

11:57.350 --> 12:00.420
is really exciting for me.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.221
Hey, bitch.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.222
Hello.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.158
-How are you?
-I'm good.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.961
With Brooke Lynn Hytes
by my side, I've got it made.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.395
What are you most scared about?

12:09.395 --> 12:12.031
I'm nervous about chakras.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.100
-Chakra. That's your drag name?
-Chakra 7.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.135
I love that.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.706
Chakra 7 is
an everywoman superhero.

12:19.706 --> 12:23.543
She protects, she's fierce,
and she wants to win.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.811
[laughs]

12:24.811 --> 12:26.446
Why did you want
to become a drag queen?

12:26.446 --> 12:28.414
I mean, the amount
of talent it takes

12:28.414 --> 12:31.584
to do what you do
is just mind-blowing.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.854
And so to play in that space
was super exciting.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.022
It's gonna be stressful,
it's gonna be hard,

12:36.022 --> 12:37.690
but I think
whenever you get stressed,

12:37.690 --> 12:40.126
just bring yourself back
to that sense of joy.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.729
If you feel it,
they're gonna feel it.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.297
I don't know
what it is about drag

12:44.297 --> 12:46.733
that's making me
feel so free

12:46.733 --> 12:49.535
to just be creative
and just have fun,

12:49.535 --> 12:51.838
kind of like how I did
when I was a little kid.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.139
Like, drag is no joke.

12:53.139 --> 12:55.174
Whoa. I love this wig.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.910
The makeup takes hours.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.278
The heels are higher.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.882
I'm just trying to breathe
in my corset.

13:02.882 --> 13:03.950

-Hello, child.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.341
So this is someone
who is not afraid to perform.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.210
Whether you do it for a living
or you do it in your bathroom,

15:11.210 --> 15:12.879
you are not afraid to do it.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.014
And that is so wonderful,

15:15.014 --> 15:17.049
because we are on
the journey with you.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.785
We're not scared for you.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.654

you did not miss a nuance

15:21.654 --> 15:23.556
of that lip sync.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.658
From the moment
you started your performance

15:25.658 --> 15:27.126
till the very end,

15:27.126 --> 15:28.895
it was fierce and fabulous.

15:28.895 --> 15:32.965
And the song is all about,
like, female empowerment and joy

15:32.965 --> 15:35.768
and the fierceness of womanhood.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.970
It was fantastic.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.906

15:39.906 --> 15:42.341

come to life.

So much fun.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.447

15:48.447 --> 15:50.783
you are every woman

15:50.783 --> 15:53.152
and a few men, too,
actually.

20 years I've

I remained in the closet,
but I'm done with all that.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.753
I grappled with femininity
as an issue a lot.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.422
Now I wanna be able to get
up there and celebrate that.

17:03.422 --> 17:06.592
Watching Drag Race, I've
been dying to just try it.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.694
I'm coming straight out of
the gate as a new performer,

17:08.694 --> 17:10.029

Who doesn't want an alter ego?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.636
Did somebody call
for a drag mother?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.204
Yes!

17:19.872 --> 17:23.075

do you wanna be a drag queen?

17:27.179 --> 17:29.248
-Exactly.
-Put it on a t-shirt.

17:29.248 --> 17:30.216
What is your drag name?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.617
Donna Bellissima.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.487
Ooh. Now, bellissima
means beautiful in Italiano.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.521
Right, and Donna means woman.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.023
Oh, all right.

17:37.023 --> 17:40.660
I'm just inspired
by these big brassy bosoms,

17:40.660 --> 17:43.095
loud, exciting women.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.497
The sex appeal oozes out.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.898
How do you feel about padding?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.566
That's, like, one of the things
I'm most excited about,

17:47.566 --> 17:50.469
because I do think that I'm
gonna embody someone different.

17:50.469 --> 17:51.470
Exactly.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.839
I'm trying to be graceful,

17:53.839 --> 17:55.608
but also I love comedy,

17:55.608 --> 17:57.310
and so that is the energy
that I'm serving.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.179

18:00.179 --> 18:01.614
I chose this week's song

18:01.614 --> 18:03.649

it really embodies to me

18:03.649 --> 18:07.119

Donna Bellissima possesses.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.587

she may be boy crazy,

18:08.587 --> 18:10.756

That's the whole goal.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.415

You were in
the grocery store I guess

20:29.028 --> 20:32.565
with my eggplant
and Michelle's melons.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.066
Were they melons?
I'm not sure.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.734
Yeah, there may have been

20:35.734 --> 20:37.636
a little bit of nerves
in the beginning,

20:37.636 --> 20:39.772
but you took us on
a really fun trip.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.408
We all love stories,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.143
and you gave us a story.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.612
I loved when
you had to play limbo

20:46.612 --> 20:49.014

Now, when you got into drag,

20:55.521 --> 20:57.356
what was the most
difficult part of this?

20:57.356 --> 21:00.159
I grew up in a very
religious environment,

21:00.159 --> 21:01.460
and I think that
you're taught

21:01.460 --> 21:03.863
that being gay
and femininity

21:03.863 --> 21:05.865
is something that you need
to, like, squash down

21:05.865 --> 21:07.166
and push inside of you.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.969
But also, it's something
that you can celebrate

21:09.969 --> 21:11.137
and just let out.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.405
And you and this show
have taught me that,

21:13.405 --> 21:16.041
and I'm here to experience that.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.703
You know, you could tell you
were nervous in the beginning.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.573
When you let loose,
you were having a good time.

29:34.573 --> 29:35.874
Yes.

Baby has her first juice box

-Hello.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.956
First of all, the visuals
I think look fantastic.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.125
I thought your entrance
was maybe a little bit timid,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.394
but halfway through
that performance,

29:55.394 --> 29:57.996
I think you were
feeling your juice

29:57.996 --> 29:59.865
and you were really
starting to have fun.

29:59.865 --> 30:00.966
You were enjoying it.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.401
Maybe sometimes
you were thinking about

30:02.401 --> 30:03.368
am I doing the right steps?

30:03.368 --> 30:04.770
Just let loose,

30:04.770 --> 30:07.406
because you did that halfway
through and it was spectacular.

30:07.406 --> 30:11.109
Thank you.
I'm having the best time.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.144
I think you did a great job.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.311
Like the other judges said,

30:13.311 --> 30:15.347
there was a little timid
there here and there.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.816
How was your first time in drag?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.052
It's been very
liberating and fun.

30:20.052 --> 30:21.787
I feel like
everyone should do it.

for many, many years,

30:53.418 --> 30:56.621
But performing drag?
That's completely daunting.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.591
This is transforming times 10,

30:59.591 --> 31:01.693

I'm a huge fan
of the art of drag,

the permission

36:00.025 --> 36:03.328
to be whatever version
of yourself that you wanna be.

I was so, so nervous
to become Thirsty,

39:27.765 --> 39:31.035

when's a better time

I want it to be playful
and a little funny.

-That was really fun.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.528
I think my favorite moment

43:17.528 --> 43:18.596
was when you were
walking backwards.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.431
I saw the look of fear
in your eyes.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.968
that that chair
was not going to be there.

43:23.968 --> 43:24.969
And once you sat down,

43:24.969 --> 43:26.070
I was, like,
you're okay, girl.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.405
You got this.

43:27.405 --> 43:28.840
And then when you started
doing the choreography

43:28.840 --> 43:30.141
then it lit up,

43:30.141 --> 43:32.577
and then you were there
and you were on fire.

43:32.577 --> 43:35.313
You look beautiful.

43:35.313 --> 43:36.647
Okay.

43:36.647 --> 43:38.649
First of all, that's
a very hard song to lip sync.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.551
-Yeah
-Fine, fine, fine, fine.

43:40.551 --> 43:43.321
They say fine, fine, fine,
like, 7.000 times.

43:43.321 --> 43:44.789
And then there's
another group of singers

43:44.789 --> 43:46.190
underneath
that fine, fine, fine,

43:46.190 --> 43:49.060
saying fine, fine, fine,
at the same time.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.695
And I was like
some of the movement

43:50.695 --> 43:52.763
and some of the dance may
have been a little tentative,

43:52.763 --> 43:55.099

43:55.099 --> 43:57.134
that you have

You know,
as I was watching you,

44:04.175 --> 44:06.611
I had the feeling
that this was a song

44:06.611 --> 44:08.779
that you've wanted
to lip sync

44:08.779 --> 44:10.381
for a very long time.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.984
Well, it's a song
that my stepdaughter said

44:12.984 --> 44:15.953
was like an example
of what my life was to her,

44:15.953 --> 44:17.388
that it was fine

44:17.388 --> 44:21.926
or that I felt that everything
was wonderful all the time.

terrifies me a little bit,

Oh, my God,
I'm going to be sore tomorrow.

46:10.668 --> 46:13.237
The biggest obstacle
going into this competition

46:13.237 --> 46:16.273
is being able to perform

46:16.273 --> 46:18.242
wearing all the things
she's wearing.

46:18.242 --> 46:21.445
I have to make sure I can
perform in heels and a corset,

46:21.445 --> 46:23.781
and then also just not
completely lose my mind.

46:23.781 --> 46:27.051
But I'm excited about
the first performance.

46:27.051 --> 46:29.687

How many licks does it take

going on with your goodies.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.663

Jackie Would,
shantay you stay.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.808
[cheers and applause]

58:31.808 --> 58:34.378
You may leave the stage.

58:34.378 --> 58:38.081
[cheers and applause]

58:40.751 --> 58:42.152
Fabulosity, I'm sorry, my dear.

58:42.152 --> 58:48.658
You are and will always be
Drag Race royalty.

58:48.658 --> 58:52.329
[cheers and applause]

58:55.399 --> 59:00.837
Now, the time has come
for you to...

59:00.837 --> 59:03.874
[echoing]
Ru-veal yourself!

59:03.874 --> 59:09.112
RuPaul, you can call me
Fabulosity

59:09.112 --> 59:10.814
or you can call me...

59:14.050 --> 59:15.685
Loretta Devine.

59:15.685 --> 59:18.255
[cheers and applause]

59:25.128 --> 59:26.463
Loretta Devine.

59:26.463 --> 59:27.531
Yes.

59:27.531 --> 59:29.099
You are a star

59:29.099 --> 59:32.102
in the greatest magnitude
of show business.

59:32.102 --> 59:33.170
Thank you.

59:33.170 --> 59:36.640
[cheers and applause]

59:36.640 --> 59:38.341
You've come a long way, baby.

59:38.341 --> 59:40.744
Let's take a look
at your journey.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.979
Oh, my God.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.815
Well, drag is so much harder

59:44.815 --> 59:46.683
than what I thought
it was gonna be,

59:46.683 --> 59:50.287
but it was so much fun
transforming into someone else.

59:50.287 --> 59:52.289
And drag is totally
different from acting.

59:52.289 --> 59:53.990
I'm so used to doing that.

59:53.990 --> 59:55.325
I know a little about drag

59:55.325 --> 59:57.394
'cause I was in Dreamgirls
light-years ago.

59:57.394 --> 59:59.162
When it first started
and they taught us

59:59.162 --> 1:00:01.031
how to put
our Dreamgirl face on,

1:00:01.031 --> 1:00:04.901
which was a kind of drag,
but not the drag.

1:00:04.901 --> 1:00:07.270
So because
there's so many things

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:10.607
that it takes
to make it a complete package.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:14.077
Doing anything in heels
at my age is difficult, I think,

1:00:14.077 --> 1:00:16.446
but once you put them on
and start,

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:19.015
you just have
to enjoy the pain,

1:00:19.015 --> 1:00:22.719
because there is pain
involved in dancing in heels.

1:00:22.719 --> 1:00:25.956
Your feet hurt, but that's
how you know you're alive.

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:29.092
And we can't wait to see you
on the mainstage looking Devine.

1:00:29.092 --> 1:00:31.027
You're gonna be a dream, girl.

1:00:31.027 --> 1:00:33.330
[all laugh]

1:00:33.330 --> 1:00:36.566
Fabulosity in me
is alive and well.

1:00:36.566 --> 1:00:40.670
Her gorgeous-osity,
gorg-eosity.

1:00:40.670 --> 1:00:42.105
A new word.

1:00:42.105 --> 1:00:44.574
I'm gonna work these bitches
once I get out there.

1:00:44.574 --> 1:00:47.477
[all laugh]

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:49.546
Yes. That's the energy,
that's the vibe.

1:00:49.546 --> 1:00:52.115
Now that I've sort of, like,
got a peek at her,

1:00:52.115 --> 1:00:55.151
Fabulosity
will forever be in my life.

1:00:55.151 --> 1:00:58.455
[cheers and applause]

1:00:58.455 --> 1:01:03.560
Loretta,
do you have any parting words?

1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:05.529
Oh, God,
I don't know what to say.

1:01:05.529 --> 1:01:07.430
It was such
a fabulous experience.

1:01:07.430 --> 1:01:09.199
-Thank you.
-Well, Loretta,

1:01:09.199 --> 1:01:12.369
thanks to Fabulosity,
your charity,

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:17.040
the NAACP Legal Defense
and Education Fund,

1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:20.210
will receive a donation
of $5.000.

1:01:20.210 --> 1:01:21.645
Yes!

1:01:21.645 --> 1:01:23.580
[laughs]

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:27.217
Absolutely!
Thank you so much!

1:01:27.217 --> 1:01:31.321
And may the superpower of drag
be with you always.

1:01:31.321 --> 1:01:32.889
Thank you.

1:01:32.889 --> 1:01:34.357
[cheers and applause]

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:36.426
Next week, eight queens
will be back

1:01:36.426 --> 1:01:38.128
to fight for the crown.

1:01:38.128 --> 1:01:41.464
But now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:41.464 --> 1:01:43.400
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:45.068
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:45.068 --> 1:01:46.202
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:49.406
All right.

Choreography is definitely
more challenging.

It's feeling harder

1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:19.903
