ALLISON:
 <i>Dread becomes unannounced and then consumes our feelings</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:08.000
 <i>with its irrational</i>
 <i>sense of doom.</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:16.300
 <i>Have you ever had</i>
 <i>the feeling of dread?</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:19.100
 <i>I'm not talking about fear.</i>

00:19.100 --> 00:20.200
 <i>Fear is immediate.</i>

00:20.200 --> 00:23.100
 <i>Fear is what k</i>

00:23.600 --> 00:25.200
 <i>A mugger with a gun.</i>

00:25.500 --> 00:27.400
 <i>A stranger in your house.</i>

00:28.000 --> 00:29.800
 <i>I'm talking about dread.</i>

00:31.700 --> 00:33.500
 <i>Dread is persistent.</i>

00:33.500 --> 00:35.200
 <i>It gnaws at you.</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.900
 <i>You can't ignore it.</i>

00:37.100 --> 00:39.400
 <i>It just won't go away.</i>

00:42.100 --> 00:43.600
 <i>Because that's what dread is.</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:46.900
 <i>It's worrying about something</i>
 <i>you can't do anything about.</i>

00:47.100 --> 00:48.800
 <i>Dread can affect your job,</i>

00:48.800 --> 00:52.200
 <i>your home, alter your entire</i>
 <i>personality.</i>

00:56.500 --> 00:58.300
Hey, sorry to wake you.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.000
I felt funny leaving
without saying good-bye.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.800
It's so early.
I know.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.900
My ride said he needed
to get in before everybody else.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.300
Your ride?
Yeah.
Remember?

01:09.300 --> 01:12.300
I dropped my car off at the shop
on the way home last night.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.700
Oh, right.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.400
I thought I was driving you.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.100
No, I told you.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.400
I looked through
the company directory and I made

01:19.400 --> 01:22.100
some phone calls-- I got a guy
from work to take me.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.500
What's with the long face?

01:25.600 --> 01:28.600
I don't know.
Funny feeling, like...

01:29.700 --> 01:32.700
Like you're...
I'm supposed to drive you or...

01:33.200 --> 01:35.100
Maybe you're not
supposed to go at all.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.500
You hear that?

01:37.500 --> 01:39.700
Maybe it's the world's
way of telling us

01:39.700 --> 01:41.800
to stay in bed, just...

01:42.300 --> 01:44.500
let a day go by without us.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.900
I'll let you explain
that to my bosses.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.600
Today's the monthly project
management meeting.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.700
But I'm sure they'd be happy
to call it on account of rain.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.000
That's my ride.
Are you sure

01:56.100 --> 01:57.500
you don't want
me to drive you?

01:57.500 --> 02:00.500
I have a funny feeling.
No, it's fine. Really.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.300
If you want to do
something for me,

02:03.300 --> 02:06.400
if it clears, maybe you can
swing by the dry cleaners

02:06.400 --> 02:08.100
and pick up my shirts.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.600
That would be...
(doorbell rings)

02:09.600 --> 02:12.000
Can you grab that?
I'm just going to get my bag.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.900
Hi, uh, I'm Bruce.
I'm here for Joe.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.800
Oh, yeah. Come in, come in.

02:18.100 --> 02:19.900
I'm Allison, I'm Joe's wife.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.100
Hope you brought your ark.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.300
Um, well, let me just...

02:29.300 --> 02:32.100
Uh, check on Joe,
see what he's up to.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.000
Hey, sorry to wake you, but...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.900
You felt funny leaving
without saying good-bye.

02:43.900 --> 02:44.600
Yeah.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.000
I need you to say home.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.000
Honey, that's my ride.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.700
No, I mean it.
I really need you to stay home.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.600
Okay. Can you tell me why?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.400
No. A feeling.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.100
Maybe it's the rain.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.100
Maybe it's the thunder.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.800
Okay, well, the rain
is going to stop,

03:02.800 --> 03:04.300
and the thunder will pass.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.600
I really need to go to work.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.400
The kids really need to go
to school, not to mention...

03:08.400 --> 03:10.900
I know. Your shirts,
the cleaners...

03:10.900 --> 03:12.800
Big meeting. Wish me luck.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.200
Luck...

04:02.300 --> 04:03.600
(thunder clapping)
Ariel!

04:05.700 --> 04:07.000
I'm right here.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.800
Today's going to be
a terrible day.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.200
What makes you say that?

04:12.200 --> 04:14.000
I don't know.
Just a feeling I have.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.000
I mean, look out the window,
it's depressing.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
I can't do anything
with my hair.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.900
It's like I know something
bad's going to happen.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.700
I don't know when
and I don't know where.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.100
I kind of want
to crawl back into bed

04:26.100 --> 04:27.700
and wait until the day is over.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.100
Well, don't say that.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.900
You know,
the rain's going to stop.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.700
The thunder's going to pass.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.200
How do you know?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.300
Daddy told me.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.200
Appreciate you doing this.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.100
Not a problem.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.400
No, I mean, really.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.600
I-I've seen you in
these monthly meetings

04:54.600 --> 04:55.800
for a couple years
and I realize,

04:55.800 --> 04:57.600
you know, we don't
know each other and I...

04:57.800 --> 05:00.400
I appreciate you going out
of your way to pick me up.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.300
Don't worry about it.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.900
I forgot my, uh, pass.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.600
Do you-- do you have yours?

05:18.500 --> 05:19.600
Thanks.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.000
DEVALOS:
 <i>There's no question about it.</i>

05:32.000 --> 05:33.300
A predominantly
female jury

05:33.300 --> 05:35.100
is going to work
against us in this case.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.700
I just wish I felt
more certain

05:37.700 --> 05:40.000
about some of the men
in the jury pool.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.000
Have you had a chance
to look at any of their files?

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
Allison?

05:50.300 --> 05:52.300
Thought we lost you there
for a moment.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.900
Oh, no, my... It's my mind.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.900
I just... can't focus
this morning.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.200
Something wrong?

05:59.300 --> 06:01.000
No, I'm just busy

06:01.000 --> 06:03.800
worrying about things
I can't do anything about.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.600
The worst thing is,
I'm not even certain

06:06.600 --> 06:08.300
what those things are.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.100
Oh, look, it stopped raining.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.500
The sun came out.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Just like Joe said it would.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.400
Listen, I'm due in court
in a few minutes.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.800
Why don't we reconvene
this afternoon

06:19.800 --> 06:22.100
when heads and schedules
are a bit clearer?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.900
(phone ringing)
WOMAN:
 <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

06:25.100 --> 06:26.700
How is this possible?

06:27.200 --> 06:29.400
This baby does not like coffee.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.200
What do you mean?

06:30.500 --> 06:32.000
Every time I take a sip

06:32.000 --> 06:33.600
before it even gets
halfway down

06:33.600 --> 06:35.300
the little bugger
sends it gushing up

06:35.300 --> 06:36.800
back through my throat again.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.400
Sounds pleasant.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.100
But I love coffee.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.000
Maybe it's not my baby.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
That doesn't seem very likely.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.700
(door opening)
MAN:
Morning everybody.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.200
Where are the boys
from Avionics?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.600
Uh, meeting
with a client in Peru.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.600
Peru? And Systems?

06:57.900 --> 06:59.400
I think they went with.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.600
Of course.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.300
Well, then this
shouldn't take long.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.900
Bruce?

07:11.500 --> 07:13.400
Bruce?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.900
Mr. Kravitz.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.500
Bruce, what are you doing here?

07:20.100 --> 07:21.600
Well...
(clears throat)

07:22.700 --> 07:26.000
This is the monthly
Project Management meeting.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.700
I manage...

07:28.300 --> 07:29.800
Satellite Telemetry Systems.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.900
I've been coming to this
meeting for three years.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.900
Is... I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

07:33.900 --> 07:35.200
Well, a little one.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.000
You are no longer

07:37.300 --> 07:39.400
the manager of
all the satellite telemetry systems.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.500
In fact, you no
longer work here.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.100
Were you not released from
your contract last week?

07:44.100 --> 07:46.300
Did you not surrender
your keys? Your computer?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.300
Your pass? How the hell
did you get in here?

07:49.500 --> 07:52.300
Uh, we rode in together.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.000
I see.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.100
Okay.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.100
Bruce, what are we doing?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.200
Well, Mr. Kravitz, um...

08:06.800 --> 08:10.200
we're offering you, uh,
the opportunity of a lifetime.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.300
We're, uh...

08:12.300 --> 08:14.300
giving you a chance
to reconsider.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.000
But there's nothing
to reconsider, Bruce.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.700
Well, I think there is,
Mr. Kravitz.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.800
There really were
no grounds to fire me.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.500
Really? Is that the way
you look at it?

08:26.700 --> 08:28.200
Am I mistaken?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
The Manzee Communications
satellite,

08:30.500 --> 08:34.500
a $60 million satellite,
a satellite on which you were responsible
for the telemetry systems,

08:34.500 --> 08:36.299
didn't that satellite
just fall out of the sky

08:36.299 --> 08:38.799
over Saudi Arabia last month?

08:38.900 --> 08:40.400
Mr. Kravitz...

08:40.400 --> 08:41.700
I came to you

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
six weeks
before launch,

08:44.700 --> 08:46.600
I told you that
we weren't ready.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.100
I told you that that satellite
wasn't going to stay up there.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.000
I told you that we needed 90 more days
of programming time.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.700
I told you that we needed
another $750,000.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.600
And I explained to you
that we didn't have it.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.600
Your job was
to make it work within the resources
you were given!

09:03.200 --> 09:04.400
You failed,
you were dismissed.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.200
Do you know something?
I think this is all the reconsidering we're
going to do on this.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.900
I'm going to ask
you to leave now.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.900
If you don't leave
within ten seconds,

09:11.900 --> 09:14.700
I'm going to call
Security to assist you, Bruce.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.600
Okay, well...

09:19.300 --> 09:22.300
Here's where we disagree.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.600
Because, uh...

09:26.600 --> 09:29.000
I think we do have more...

09:29.300 --> 09:30.900
to talk about.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.900
Beautiful day.
Beautiful day.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.800
Yes, beautiful day, yes.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.600
Oh, no.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.800
(voice mail):
Hi, you've reached Joe Dubois.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
Sorry I'm not around
to take your call,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.000
but leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.
(beeps)

10:00.200 --> 10:01.300
Hey, it's me.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.000
I'm sorry, I suddenly got
that feeling again...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.400
REPORTER (on TV):
We interrupt our current program
to bring you breaking news.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.300
Gunshots have been reportedly
fired inside the offices

10:38.100 --> 10:39.500
Are you done, Ariel?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
I need to call my mom.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.500
What are you talking about?
Are you ill?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.600
It's hard to describe.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.200
It's just... I really need
to call my mom.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.400
Are you sure
this isn't something the nurse can
help you with?

10:55.500 --> 10:59.500
All right, give me your test
and I'll write you a pass to the principal's.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.900
Come on, move!

11:05.100 --> 11:06.300
Hi, you've reached Joe DuBois.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.400
Sorry I'm not around...

11:15.000 --> 11:17.300
I guess everybody heard
that shot.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.100
They're evacuating the building.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.800
Everyone's outside already.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.700
Please be seated.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.500
Excellent, our tax dollars at work.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.400
Okay, so now we've shot
a hole in the ceiling,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.200
we've all surrendered our
cell phones, where to next?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.900
I'd like to move this along--
I have desk full of work

11:37.900 --> 11:40.400
and the wife has tickets
to the theater tonight.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.600
Is this a joke to you?
Does this amuse you?

11:44.800 --> 11:47.700
I'm sorry-- do you sense
amusement here, Bruce?

11:47.700 --> 11:48.600
Well, forgive me.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.100
Whatever I've done
to give that impression,

11:50.100 --> 11:51.800
I apologize. I am not amused.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.200
Not in the least.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.100
A little bored,

11:54.100 --> 11:54.600
a little peeved.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.900
Wouldn't want to be sitting
beneath that hole

11:55.900 --> 11:59.200
if the rains starts up again,
but amused? I think not.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.400
So what say
we get to it?

12:01.500 --> 12:05.000
What's your end game?
What do you want?!

12:17.300 --> 12:18.700
I told you.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.600
I told you what I want,
Mr. Kravitz.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.800
I want my job back,
my pension, my health benefits,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.500
my life insurance.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.800
I want it to be as though
last week never happened.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.200
Little late for that,
don't you think?

12:35.500 --> 12:37.300
Well, wait a second.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
Let's talk about it.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.000
Is it too late?

12:42.500 --> 12:44.100
If nobody's hurt,

12:44.100 --> 12:45.700
everybody's fine.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.000
Yeah, there's a hole
in the ceiling,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.200
but that can be fixed.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.900
So what about his job?

12:51.900 --> 12:55.900
Is there something,
anything to talk about here?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.800
Are you serious?

12:58.300 --> 13:00.000
First of all, I'm not
agreeing to anything

13:00.000 --> 13:02.100
when there's a gun
pointed at me.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.500
Well, he makes
a good point, Bruce.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.300
What's it gonna take to get you
to put that gun away?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.900
There's really nothing
to talk about until you do.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.300
All right, how about Melinda?

13:19.800 --> 13:23.000
How about you let her
go out the door and down the stairs?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.600
All the stress is not
good for her or her baby.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.600
No one's going anywhere.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
Why don't you have a seat, Joe?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.400
The man has spoken.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.900
We'd all better do
as he says or who knows?

13:41.900 --> 13:42.800
He may take his pop gun

13:42.800 --> 13:44.400
and put another
hole in the plaster.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.900
Mr. Kravitz...
Please.
You know what?

13:45.900 --> 13:48.300
I've had about as much of this
as I care to.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.800
If he were gonna
do something,he'd have done
it by now.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.200
He's got one gun.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.100
Who knows how many bullets?
He's already wasted one.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.100
Look at him.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.300
Does he threaten you?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.600
He doesn't threaten me.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.100
In fact, you know
what I'm gonna do?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.000
I'm leaving.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.900
I'm gonna walk out
that door right now

14:03.200 --> 14:05.200
and let's see if he
tries to stop me.

14:13.100 --> 14:16.700
I may have spoken
a bit precipitously.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.800
Joe!

14:36.800 --> 14:38.400
Joe Dubois?!

14:39.800 --> 14:42.600
Has anyone seen
Joe DuBois?! Joe!

14:43.100 --> 14:44.100
Looking for somebody?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.300
My husband. He works here.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.500
He's not answer his cell phone.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.900
I don't see him anywhere.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.000
Do you know what's going on?

14:50.000 --> 14:50.900
Who's still in there?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.200
We're trying
to figure that out.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.600
Actually, if you give
me his name,

14:53.600 --> 14:55.000
we'll have people
look out for him.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.500
Joe DuBois. D-U-B-O-I-S

14:58.700 --> 15:01.700
REPORTER:
A shot or shots were fired
at Aerodytech.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.600
As you can see from the shot
from our Action News chopper,

15:04.900 --> 15:06.800
(knocking)
police are starting
to gather up...

15:07.600 --> 15:09.300
I'm sorry to bother you,
Principal Philips,

15:09.300 --> 15:10.800
but I need to call my mom

15:10.800 --> 15:13.300
and they said I couldn't use the
phone without your permission.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.800
What's so urgent it can't wait
till school's out, Ariel?

15:16.700 --> 15:20.500
It's just... I have this
really bad feeling.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.100
Anything you want to talk
to me about?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.700
No.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.900
Ariel, what do you think
your mom can do

15:28.900 --> 15:31.500
to make that feeling go away?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.400
I don't know.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.200
Maybe say something.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.800
I'm gonna say no, Ariel.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.400
because you're in
the eighth grade,

15:39.400 --> 15:41.000
and by the time
we get to the eighth grade,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.300
even though we have
bad feelings,

15:42.300 --> 15:43.500
we should be able
to get through the day

15:43.500 --> 15:45.300
without talking
to our moms and dads.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.300
I'm gonna ask you to go back
to your classroom

15:47.300 --> 15:49.200
and whatever feelings you have,

15:49.400 --> 15:52.500
they're just gonna have to wait
until the end of the day, okay?

15:53.100 --> 15:54.400
Yeah.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.700
MAN:
This way,
Mr. District Attorney.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.600
Mr. District Attorney!

16:03.700 --> 16:04.700
Allison, what
are you doing here?

16:04.700 --> 16:05.600
My husband works here.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.300
Can you help me
find out if he's all right?

16:17.900 --> 16:18.900
You're just in time.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.900
We're just about
to try and make contact.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.500
Do you know where
he is, who he is?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.200
Basically,

16:23.500 --> 16:26.100
we're just dialing extensions until somebody picks up.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.800
Checking your e-mail?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.900
Here's the thing: I can't
give you your job back.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.300
That ship has left the dock,
but it's not too late.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.300
You let us walk out
of here, all of us,

16:49.800 --> 16:51.600
and we'll come up
with a story.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.200
We're all engineers,

16:54.200 --> 16:57.200
we're in this room
testing some new polymer

16:58.400 --> 17:00.500
and we got the idea
to fire a gun at it.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.700
And you're here 'cause this
used to be your project.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.300
Anyway, this new polymer, it's
supposed to be bulletproof,

17:07.300 --> 17:08.800
so we shot at it to test it.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.800
Didn't even realize
the building had
been evacuated.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.400
That's the story and
we all stick with it.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.300
I write you a glowing
letter of recommendation

17:22.400 --> 17:24.000
and six months from now

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
you have a better job
than you ever had here.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.800
Is anyone else hot?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.700
I-I'm hot.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.500
I turned the air off.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.100
It's one of the first things
they do when they think they've got a hostage situation
on their hands.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.100
Aaron,
I want you to go over to the window
and lower the blinds.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.500
Would you do that
for me, please?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.800
I think it'll bring down
the heat a little bit.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.000
Oh, Aaron,

17:51.400 --> 17:53.800
put your hands on your head
on the way over there

17:53.800 --> 17:56.300
so that they know
you're not armed.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.700
You know, I don't want
you to get shot by accident.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.900
Joe, will you answer that
for me, please?

18:31.000 --> 18:31.900
Hello?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.000
They want
to speak with you.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.400
Tell them I'm not actually
taking calls right now.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.100
He won't come to the phone.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.500
MAN:
Can you tell me
his name?

18:46.400 --> 18:47.800
His name?

18:51.700 --> 18:53.800
He'd rather I didn't say.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.200
Us? There are
four of us plus him.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.100
Our names?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.800
Let's not make it
too easy for them.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.500
Again, he'd rather I didn't say.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.400
Yes, he's armed.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.200
No, he hasn't, not yet.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.400
What? He hasn't what?

19:18.600 --> 19:20.300
Hurt anyone.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.300
They're asking
if you've hurt anyone.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.600
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

19:38.900 --> 19:41.000
You can hang up
the phone now, Joe.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.000
They know everything
they need to know.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.800
ow
ç|ç|c

19:47.800 --> 19:49.200
We heard gunshots.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.200
Hello?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.100
He's gone.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.900
Do we know where he is?
We made contact through

19:55.900 --> 19:57.600
an extension in the
west conference center.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.300
Well, then he's practically
friends and family.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.200
Let's call him back.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.900
Um...

20:19.600 --> 20:21.800
Okay, well, who wants
to make sure Aaron's dead

20:21.800 --> 20:24.600
and who wants to pick up the
phone so that it stops ringing?

20:29.100 --> 20:32.100
Melinda, why don't you check his pulse,
and, Mr. Kravitz,
(ringing)

20:32.100 --> 20:33.400
you know how
to work a phone,

20:33.600 --> 20:34.900
don't you?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.700
Now hang it up.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.600
And when they call
back in 30 seconds,

20:47.600 --> 20:50.000
just do it again
and keep doing it

20:50.700 --> 20:53.200
until they get the idea
to stop calling me.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.400
Okay, um... Joe?

21:11.400 --> 21:13.500
I'm going to need you
over here, please.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.800
There's no pulse.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.100
I don't feel any pulse.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.200
He has-- He has
no pulse.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.100
Have a seat.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.400
Okay, Joe, um...
(clears throat)

21:41.200 --> 21:43.500
I'm going to need you to sign
into your Aerodytech account.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.400
He just keeps hanging up.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.500
Oh, my God.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.100
What?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.800
Let's step outside.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.000
You see something
there, don't you?

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
It's a man Joe works with.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.600
The fact that you're seeing
him and I'm not means...

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Do you think you could
get the police

22:33.000 --> 22:35.300
to let me across the barricade,
let me up there?

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
Maybe I could talk to him.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.700
Maybe I could find out
what he knows,

22:38.700 --> 22:40.400
what's going on up there.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.700
Maybe I could find out
about Joe.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.300
BRUCE:
 <i>Joe Dubois just called.</i>

23:01.800 --> 23:03.300
 <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

23:03.300 --> 23:05.600
 <i>That was Joe Dubois.</i>
 <i>He needs a ride to work.</i>

23:06.100 --> 23:07.800
I mean,
that's a...

23:08.300 --> 23:09.900
I mean, that's
fate, right?

23:09.900 --> 23:12.300
I mean, that's...
that's...

23:12.300 --> 23:13.700
that's providence.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.800
I'm supposed to go back there.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.500
No, you're not.
You were fired.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.900
Honey, I was unfairly dismissed.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.100
And...

23:25.700 --> 23:27.700
and I'm sick.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.700
Honey...

23:30.800 --> 23:32.600
I'm dying.

23:33.900 --> 23:37.300
And every day this thing
eats more and more of my brain.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.200
Two months... right?

23:41.200 --> 23:42.700
The doctor said two months.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.500
And you need money.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.400
Right?

23:48.300 --> 23:50.200
And if they won't
give me my job back

23:50.200 --> 23:52.500
and they won't give you
my pension...

23:52.700 --> 23:54.800
Gail, honey,

23:55.500 --> 23:57.800
you're gonna
need money.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.100
I'm sorry.

24:24.900 --> 24:25.800
I... that...

24:25.800 --> 24:27.300
that's all I can do. I...

24:27.500 --> 24:28.700
That's as far as I can go.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.300
I don't have...

24:30.400 --> 24:32.700
access to that part
of the system.

24:33.100 --> 24:33.900
To the root directory?

24:33.900 --> 24:35.900
You don't have access
to the root directory?

24:39.500 --> 24:41.400
Oh, my goodness.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.500
Who would?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.400
I mean, a clearance
like that would require

24:47.700 --> 24:51.500
someone in senior
management, someone the company could rely on
in a time of crisis

24:51.500 --> 24:55.500
to exhibit courage
and character and loyalty.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
We all know who
I'm talking about.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.300
I can't get you into
the root directory, Bruce.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.700
Believe me, I would if I could.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.600
But, honestly...
Really?

25:08.300 --> 25:10.500
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm going to do, Mr. Kravitz.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.400
I'm going to promote you, okay?

25:12.400 --> 25:15.400
I'm going to make it your job to
get me into the root directory.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
I guess I'm going to need you
to make it work...

25:19.100 --> 25:22.300
with the resources
that you have available to you.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.600
It's not about resources.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.600
It's about being given a task that I am simply incapable
of performing.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.600
Surely you can see
the distinction there.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.400
Yeah, I'm afraid I don't
see the distinction!

25:36.400 --> 25:38.100
Okay, so I think that...

25:38.100 --> 25:40.000
I think this discussion is over.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.700
So I'm going to
need you to get up,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.300
walk over here,
sit your ass in the chair

25:44.300 --> 25:46.300
and get me
into the root directory.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.600
Mr. Kravitz...

26:13.900 --> 26:15.500
you're wasting my time.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.000
But as I just
explained to you,

26:22.100 --> 26:24.400
I don't know the first thing
about how to get you...

26:25.500 --> 26:27.100
Hey.
He's okay.

26:27.100 --> 26:27.900
He's okay. Joe.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.600
Sit down, all right?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.500
Just a memory jogger.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.100
Right, Mr. Kravitz?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.100
All right.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.300
It's not too bad.
It's not too bad.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.500
Okay... (clears throat)

26:47.200 --> 26:49.100
so about the root directory.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.900
Joe's still alive.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.700
 <i>If you enter from the back of the building,</i>

26:59.700 --> 27:01.800
you won't be seen
from the window...
Sorry to interrupt.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.400
But as you know, Mrs. Dubois'
husband is one of the hostages.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.900
Apparently, he was able
to hold on to his cell phone until a few moments ago

27:07.900 --> 27:09.700
and has given her a great deal
of information

27:09.700 --> 27:11.100
about what's
going on inside.

27:11.100 --> 27:14.800
The hostage taker's a former employee
named Bruce Rossiter.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.500
See if he has a wife
or a mother,

27:16.500 --> 27:18.200
and see if we can get them
down here, all right?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.800
In addition
to my husband,

27:20.300 --> 27:22.600
there's a senior executive
named Dylan Kravitz

27:22.600 --> 27:25.600
and a pregnant engineer named
Melinda Bell are still up there.

27:27.200 --> 27:31.200
A junior engineer named
Aaron Cahill was the man we heard being shot
earlier-- 

27:31.500 --> 27:32.500
he is dead.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.500
And we're certain of that?

27:35.500 --> 27:37.900
Yes, we're absolutely certain.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.200
You're in.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.600
Nicely done, Mr. Kravitz.

27:46.900 --> 27:49.100
Now pull up everything there is
in Beta Omicron.

27:50.400 --> 27:54.400
TV REPORTER:
 <i>Reports continue to leak out of a unconfirmed
death here at Aerodytech.</i>

27:54.400 --> 27:57.200
Our sources informing us that
the identity of the deceased

27:57.200 --> 28:00.500
is being withheld pending
notification of next of kin.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.000
Principal Phillips, I really
need to use that phone.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.100
Ariel, we've had
this conversation.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.700
Aren't you supposed
to be in class?

28:07.900 --> 28:08.600
Yeah, I know.

28:08.600 --> 28:10.300
But this is really urgent.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.900
Really urgent? No.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.900
The only thing
that's really urgent is that you get back to class.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.000
And what would you do
if I said no?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.400
Excuse me?

28:18.400 --> 28:20.000
What would you do if I told you

28:20.000 --> 28:22.300
that I'm just not
going back to class?

28:23.900 --> 28:24.700
Come in here, young lady.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.900
Have a seat.
We're calling your parents.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.700
????

28:34.800 --> 28:35.800
Okay, good.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.500
Copy all of those and
don't leave anything out.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.400
Okay, but do you mind if I ask what is
all this stuff for,

28:43.400 --> 28:45.300
posterity?
You won't be able to sell it.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.500
It's not as if any of our
competitors are interested

28:49.500 --> 28:52.900
in buying designs of satellites
that fall out of the sky.

28:54.000 --> 28:54.900
Well, you never know.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.500
There's always eBay.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.000
You've already done
the programming corrections,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.300
haven't you?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.300
You've done them
yourself.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.500
I told you not to and
you did them yourself...

29:06.500 --> 29:08.700
on your own time,
on your own dime.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.300
You have a buyer already,
haven't you?

29:11.500 --> 29:15.100
You want to know
the ironic part, Mr. Kravitz?

29:15.800 --> 29:17.700
I did it for you.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.900
I did it for Aerodytech.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.700
What a fool, huh?

29:27.700 --> 29:30.000
Bruce, this makes
no sense.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.100
You've killed a man.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.200
You're never going
to get away with this.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.400
I know.

29:36.700 --> 29:40.800
I... I guess I must just be
out of my mind, huh?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.000
Mrs. Rossiter.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.000
You're married
to Bruce Rossiter.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.400
Yes, Bruce is my husband.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.900
Why, has something happened?

30:02.900 --> 30:04.900
It's terrifying
to open your door and see

30:04.900 --> 30:07.000
the police standing there
and not know why.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
I've just had
this feeling

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
that today was going
to be a bad day.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.700
Have you turned on
your television today?

30:11.700 --> 30:13.200
Listened to the radio?

30:13.300 --> 30:14.900
No.
Did you know

30:14.900 --> 30:17.500
your husband was coming here
to Aerodytech today?

30:18.500 --> 30:21.000
This man called him last night
and asked him for a ride

30:21.000 --> 30:22.700
and he thought
it was a sign.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.100
So he was going to go in
and ask for his job back.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.300
Why?

30:26.300 --> 30:28.300
Something happened?
Is something wrong?

30:29.200 --> 30:31.000
We believe your
husband is inside

30:31.000 --> 30:33.400
holding a number of
people hostage.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.700
(ringtone playing)
We also believe

30:34.700 --> 30:37.200
he may have already
killed one man.

30:37.700 --> 30:38.800
MRS. ROSSITER:
Nonsense.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.500
That's crazy.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.200
Bruce wouldn't
hurt anyone.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.500
Certainly no one here.
He loved this company.

30:48.700 --> 30:49.900
Hello?
Ms. Dubois?

30:49.900 --> 30:52.500
Yes, this is Principal Phillips over at North Street
Middle School.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.000
I have Ariel in my office.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.400
Is something wrong?
Is she all right?

30:55.400 --> 30:56.500
No, no, she's fine.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.900
But, frankly, she's been
refusing to go to class.

30:58.900 --> 31:01.500
May I talk to her?
Can I please just talk to her?

31:03.400 --> 31:05.600
Looks like someone's
getting their wish.

31:09.100 --> 31:09.900
Mom?

31:09.900 --> 31:12.700
Ariel, not today.
You can't do this to me today.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.000
Mom, don't talk.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.600
Just listen.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.800
I saw this man...

31:19.500 --> 31:22.000
and Dad called him and asked him
for a ride to work...

31:26.700 --> 31:30.300
No! The man you're talking
about is not my husband.

31:30.300 --> 31:33.000
He wouldn't kill anyone.
He couldn't kill anyone.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.200
Isn't it true, Mrs. Rossiter,

31:34.200 --> 31:36.500
that your husband has
a disease of the brain?

31:37.100 --> 31:39.400
That he only has
weeks to live?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.200
He's already a dead man,
isn't he?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.700
Which means everyone that he
is holding at gunpoint up there

31:44.700 --> 31:47.200
is most certainly dead, too.

32:04.700 --> 32:08.000
They're starting to position
men inside the building to breach the conference room.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.400
They don't know
what else to do.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.600
He won't get on the phone
and negotiate with them.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.600
He seems determined
to do whatever it is
he's doing up there.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.100
And now that we know
he's terminal...

32:18.200 --> 32:21.700
From the moment I opened my
eyes this morning, I knew it.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.400
I could feel it.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.800
I wanted him to stay home.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.900
But he just couldn't feel it
the way that I could feel it.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.700
I'm so sorry, Allison.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.400
I wish there were
more I could do.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.000
You skipped one.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.700
You skip one it's worthless.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.700
I'm sorry. It was
an accident. I'm sorry.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.900
Joe, would you mind?

33:13.800 --> 33:15.400
Joe, hang it up now please.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.500
It's your wife.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.700
Okay... every,
every single file.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.700
Every single file.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.200
Just... just slide it over.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
Gail?

33:46.800 --> 33:48.600
Oh, my God, Bruce.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.500
What are you doing?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.400
Honey, I don't know
what you mean.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
I told you I was coming here.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.900
I'm doing what I have to do.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.600
But you should see it
out here.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
There are police everywhere.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.400
Everything's going
to be okay, honey.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.900
They're saying you killed a man.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.600
Is it true? Did you...

34:17.600 --> 34:19.199
actually kill someone?

34:19.199 --> 34:22.400
Gail, I know what
I'm doing, okay?

34:22.400 --> 34:24.400
Oh, I don't think you do.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.699
I think the cancer
in your brain

34:27.699 --> 34:29.900
is making you go crazy.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.699
Gail, that's...
(clearing throat)

34:34.000 --> 34:35.500
that's our business, okay.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
I don't want to
discuss that here.

34:37.500 --> 34:41.100
You'll be dead, and me,
your son,

34:41.199 --> 34:43.699
we'll still be living here
and people will know

34:43.699 --> 34:45.300
what you've done.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.800
Tell you what, um, honey,
I'm almost done.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.000
So just let me do
what I have to do, okay?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.699
No, I can't.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.200
Am I ever going
to see you again?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.800
Well, that's up
to the police, honey.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.600
What about the other ones--

35:02.700 --> 35:04.600
the people you're holding?

35:04.900 --> 35:07.500
Will they see
their families again?

35:19.100 --> 35:20.300
I need to hang up now, honey.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.100
Yeah, but the police...

35:22.100 --> 35:24.400
they think you're going
to kill them all.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.700
Tell them you're not going
to kill them all.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.200
Gail... I love you.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.300
Oh, Bruce...

35:40.300 --> 35:41.700
You tell Ethan, that I love him.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.700
I love him so much.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.200
Okay, I have to hang up
now, babe.

35:46.300 --> 35:48.200
Bruce?!

36:06.400 --> 36:07.600
I'm almost done.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.100
So, is that true?

36:13.700 --> 36:15.100
You really sick?

36:15.100 --> 36:17.200
Why don't you think about it,
Mr. Kravitz,

36:17.500 --> 36:18.600
you can't do something like this

36:18.600 --> 36:20.200
and expect to have
any kind of a future.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.300
Well, I have a future!

36:22.500 --> 36:24.400
I have a baby!

36:25.400 --> 36:27.800
We all have futures, Bruce.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
I mean, think about it.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.700
It really...

36:32.700 --> 36:35.100
I mean it really
just comes down to you.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.500
You can give us that.

36:36.500 --> 36:40.300
You can... you can
show us the mercy

36:41.200 --> 36:43.400
that you feel has
been denied you.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.900
And that would be,
at least in part, a-a-a...

36:46.900 --> 36:49.000
a legacy

36:49.000 --> 36:50.900
that you could leave
to your family.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.900
KRAVITZ:
He's right.
You should be thinking of your family right now.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.100
You don't want to do this to them.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.100
Don't you dare.

37:00.100 --> 37:03.800
Don't you dare pretend
to give a crap about my family.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.000
If you possessed
even an ounce of mercy,

37:06.000 --> 37:07.700
an ounce of fairness,

37:07.700 --> 37:09.700
none of us
would be here.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.600
But you don't.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.700
And we are.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.100
No! There is no reason

37:18.100 --> 37:19.600
for you to kill us.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.200
Bruce, you are a logical man.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.300
What... What purpose
could it possibly serve

37:26.300 --> 37:29.400
for you to shoot
us all? None.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.500
There's no reason

37:31.500 --> 37:34.200
why we couldn't
all walk out of here.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
Think, Bruce, think about it.

37:36.900 --> 37:39.200
Joe, I have thought about it.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.800
And everything
we've done here...

37:43.400 --> 37:46.800
every key stroke on the computer
has been completely encrypted.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.200
Understand?

37:48.200 --> 37:50.000
So six months from now
when my wife gets a call

37:50.000 --> 37:51.100
from a lawyer
in the Cayman Islands

37:51.100 --> 37:53.400
telling her about
her unexpected windfall,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.100
no one will be able to trace it
back to this room.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.700
To any of us.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.500
To what's happened here.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.800
Unless...

38:06.200 --> 38:09.400
you know, unless someone
makes it out that door.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.500
I'm really, really sorry.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
Upon my signal--
all firearms at the ready.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.000
No. No.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.500
How are you going to do it?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.200
What do you mean?

39:23.400 --> 39:25.200
I mean, you only get
one shot, you know.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.100
One shot and every policeman
in Phoenix who can fire a gun

39:28.100 --> 39:29.800
is coming through that door.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.300
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:33.100 --> 39:34.800
I can shoot three people.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.400
No, you can't!

39:42.000 --> 39:44.800
No... No!

39:46.200 --> 39:47.500
Don't anybody move!

40:15.100 --> 40:16.300
Allison.
(laughing)

40:16.900 --> 40:18.800
Allison?

40:18.800 --> 40:20.300
The dread...

40:20.700 --> 40:22.900
I think it just left.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.200
ARIEL:
Mom...

40:48.500 --> 40:50.000
Shh.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.400
What are we doing?

41:02.500 --> 41:05.100
We're watching
Daddy sleep.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.600
It's the first time he's
slept through the night

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
since Aaron's funeral.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.700
Oh, look, he's smiling.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.300
I was afraid he would
never smile again.

41:20.500 --> 41:24.900
 <i>Hope, like dread, it often</i>
 <i>comes unannounced,</i>

41:24.900 --> 41:27.000
 <i>and then thankfully</i>
 <i>intoxicates us</i>

41:27.000 --> 41:28.400
 <i>and inoculates our feelings</i>

41:28.400 --> 41:31.300
 <i>with an irrational sense</i>
 <i>of joy and optimism.</i>

41:32.600 --> 41:36.100
 <i>Hope is the high,</i>
 <i>dread is the low.</i>

41:37.400 --> 41:40.700
 <i>I guess life is the stuff</i>
 <i>in between.</i>
