00:17.600 --> 00:19.184
ANNOUNCER: Galactic showdown!

00:19.352 --> 00:22.771
In a fierce battle for survival,
the Republic and Separatist armies

00:22.939 --> 00:25.107
have clashed in the distant Sullust system.

00:25.442 --> 00:30.612
Count Dooku's most cunning assassin,
Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.249
Trident group one,
attack the starboard engines.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.338
Trident group two,
knock out their port shield generators.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.799
I'll go directly for their bridge.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.765
The port side deflectors are gone!

01:07.609 --> 01:08.734
(EXPLOSIONS)

01:19.996 --> 01:21.580
Lord Tyrannus.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.165
My master.

01:23.666 --> 01:27.169
There is a disturbance in the Force.

01:27.504 --> 01:32.174
Your assassin,
she has become very powerful.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.345
Yes, my Lord.
She is quite important to me.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.305
Too important.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.182
-Master...
-Silence!

01:40.517 --> 01:43.519
I can sense her powers growing stronger.

01:44.020 --> 01:49.691
I would hate to think you are training
your own Sith apprentice to destroy me.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.488
Never!
My allegiance is to you, and you alone!

01:54.697 --> 01:56.740
Then you must prove it.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.408
Eliminate her.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.369
She's my most trusted...

02:00.495 --> 02:02.663
I said eliminate her!

02:04.374 --> 02:06.750
As you wish, my Lord.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.175
(BEEPING)

02:15.593 --> 02:17.219
-Ventress!
-Split up!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.060
Looks like I'm her favorite!

02:27.647 --> 02:30.274
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.240
You wanna race? Come on!

02:55.425 --> 02:57.342
Anakin, I'm going to need some help.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.594
Where are you?

03:09.731 --> 03:12.441
I'm hit! I'm heading
towards the Separatist flagship.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.818
ANAKIN: I see you! I've got her.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.211
Master, I need your help, quickly.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.171
I'm surrounded.

03:34.505 --> 03:37.257
You have already lost the battle, child.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.677
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.639
No! I will destroy the Jedi.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.015
I'll show you!

03:45.225 --> 03:48.769
You have failed me for the last time.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.564
You are no longer my apprentice.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.151
And now, you shall die.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.118
Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan!

04:08.248 --> 04:09.623
Oh! Thank you!

04:09.791 --> 04:12.417
Thank you, Artoo, that's quite enough.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.179
Ventress. You're not looking well.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.847
She never does.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.725
You have failed, Ventress. Surrender!

04:29.143 --> 04:30.227
Never!

04:54.377 --> 04:55.460
Yes, my Lord.

04:55.753 --> 04:59.715
Ventress is battling the Jedi
onboard the command ship.

04:59.882 --> 05:03.051
Turn your guns on our command ship
and open fire!

05:03.553 --> 05:09.599
But, my Lord, I calculate that will destroy
Ventress, the Jedi, and all our forces.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.768
Precisely.

Open fire.

(GRUNTS)

06:10.661 --> 06:15.415
That is correct. Calculate your flight path
to terminate in the main hangar.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.337
It's over!

06:23.633 --> 06:25.092
Anakin! Look out!

06:29.347 --> 06:30.639
We have to get out of here!

06:52.328 --> 06:54.579
The command ship has been destroyed.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.125
Our scanning indicates
there are no survivors.

06:58.626 --> 07:02.462
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.297
By your command.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.021
Master.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.691
What is it, Lord Tyrannus?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.318
I have done as you've asked.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.280
Asajj Ventress is dead.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.073

didn't you, missy?

08:24.253 --> 08:25.545
(LAUGHS)

08:26.589 --> 08:28.423
Which side of the battle was you on?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.676
Aw.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.553
Not too talkative, are you?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.055
(GRUNTS)

08:35.431 --> 08:38.767
Take me to Dathomir.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.103
Now why would anyone want to go there?

08:42.188 --> 08:44.773
Ain't nothing there but fog and witches.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.608
Exactly.

09:55.177 --> 09:58.013
She is one of us.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.016
Take her to the village.

10:01.142 --> 10:05.395
-Who is she? What is she doing here?
-Quiet. Quiet!

10:05.646 --> 10:08.315
Mother Talzin.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.756
Bring the water of life.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.239
At last, you have returned,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.742
and you are safe again.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.250
I remember the day
we were forced to give you up

11:09.752 --> 11:11.711
to protect the clan.

11:12.588 --> 11:17.592
Your sacrifice has never been forgotten.

12:49.393 --> 12:53.396

12:54.940 --> 12:58.359
I will teach you the ways of the darkside,

12:58.944 --> 13:02.280
but you must prove yourself first.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.287
Master, I need your help, quickly.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.457
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.460
No! I will destroy the Jedi.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.795
I'll show you!

You have failed me for the last time.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.885
And now, you shall die.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.640
Dooku. He betrayed me.

13:29.225 --> 13:34.479
I know. I had hoped
you would find your way to us sooner.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.774
I will have revenge.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.485
Yes, you shall, Sister.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.738
We will see to it.

13:44.073 --> 13:49.244
Karis and Naa'leth
are the greatest warriors of our coven.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.205
I'll be the judge of that.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.584
They will help you destroy Count Dooku.

Sister, we have assembled a potion

14:29.618 --> 14:34.622
in order to reach
Dooku's palace undetected.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.126
Step into the mist

14:38.502 --> 14:42.046
and become like shadows.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.730
Now you are invisible to most.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.357
Even Count Dooku?

15:01.817 --> 15:06.195
Yes, perhaps even Count Dooku.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.573
What if he can sense us?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.993
Take this poison dart.

15:12.036 --> 15:16.372
It will dull his senses
and distort his vision.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.668
Then you can deal with him easily.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.173
Jedi weapons?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.175
You'll need these.

15:27.676 --> 15:33.890
If the Count engages you,
he must believe that you are Jedi.

15:34.850 --> 15:39.062
Naa'leth and Karis, serve your sister well.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.525
Deliver your vengeance, Sister,

15:45.402 --> 15:48.363

I can smell his stench a parsec away.

Be on guard at all times. He is no fool.

others see opportunity.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.933
What do you mean, Mother?

20:27.142 --> 20:32.313
Your infiltration
proves Dooku is vulnerable.

He will be eager to protect himself.

you have lost your most prized assassin.

I have seen it.

are of an extraordinary caliber.

Perhaps a male from our planet
will be more to your liking,
