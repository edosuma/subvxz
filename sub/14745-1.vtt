04:11.801 --> 04:13.200
No ice.

06:05.648 --> 06:06.979
Stop it!

06:38.014 --> 06:40.312
I don't know what's got into him.
He's gone crazy.

06:50.093 --> 06:51.390
Oh, my God.

07:50.019 --> 07:51.316
Forever.

07:55.191 --> 07:56.681
What?

07:57.827 --> 07:59.692
Forever and ever.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.853
Big Macs.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.323
HeIIo.

10:22.104 --> 10:24.538
He's manic. That's what's so strange.

10:25.641 --> 10:27.836
<i>After all these hours...</i>

10:28.044 --> 10:31.980
there's no faIIoff in activity,
no drop in his bIood pressure.

10:32.515 --> 10:35.780
-Okay, so what went wrong?
-His temperature's stiII way up.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.718
-PhyI?
-Night before Iast, he didn't sIeep a wink.

10:39.021 --> 10:42.320
<i>He hasn't slept now for 50-some hours.</i>

10:42.425 --> 10:44.086
Fifty-six.

10:45.094 --> 10:47.654
<i>All day yesterday, he got uglier and uglier.</i>

10:47.863 --> 10:50.229
<i>Last night, he turned on Betty.</i>

10:51.567 --> 10:54.536
-He Ioved Betty.
-You thought he Ioved Betty.

10:55.604 --> 10:58.368
He tore her apart and then he ate her.

11:05.514 --> 11:08.347
Okay, Iet's get
the oId video equipment in here.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.408
I want to record every move he makes.

11:10.486 --> 11:12.613
I couId kiII him. I couId, reaIIy.

11:13.389 --> 11:16.654
CarefuI, PhyI. That's a $2,000 monkey
you're taIking about.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.361
Don't you snarI at me,
you eviI son of a bitch.

12:07.877 --> 12:11.074
Forever and ever.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.059
<i>These children are all</i>
<i>8, 9, and 10 years old...</i>

12:33.135 --> 12:35.262
<i>though they have</i>
<i>the physical characteristics...</i>

12:35.337 --> 12:37.965
<i>of someone in their 70s or even older.</i>

12:38.441 --> 12:41.239
<i>They all suffer from</i>
<i>a disease called progeria.</i>

12:42.445 --> 12:45.937
<i>We don't know exactly what it is,</i>
<i>but what it amounts to...</i>

12:46.015 --> 12:49.212
<i>is a premature degeneration</i>
<i>comparable to that of aging.</i>

12:49.752 --> 12:51.982
<i>What we call the internal clock...</i>

12:52.288 --> 12:55.189
<i>begins to speed up</i>
<i>at about the age of five.</i>

12:55.691 --> 13:00.560
<i>lt's a terminal disease.</i>
<i>The average life expectancy is about 16.</i>

13:01.230 --> 13:02.720
<i>-Tragic.</i>
<i>-Yes, it is...</i>

13:02.798 --> 13:05.790
<i>and the main focus of our work</i>
<i>at Park West...</i>

13:05.935 --> 13:10.429
<i>is to try to reverse this process</i>
<i>and actually slow down this internal clock.</i>

13:11.707 --> 13:14.232
<i>l won't use</i>
<i>that magic word ''immortality''...</i>

13:14.310 --> 13:17.302
<i>but longevity is something</i>
<i>that's got to be....</i>

13:17.379 --> 13:18.471
SIeep weII?

13:18.547 --> 13:21.209
<i>ln this day and age</i>
<i>with all our fantastic technology....</i>

13:21.283 --> 13:23.410
Come here. Sit here.

13:23.486 --> 13:25.920
<i>...if only l'd been born 50 years later....</i>

13:43.706 --> 13:46.402
Gotcha. You Iook awfuI.

13:46.475 --> 13:49.672
-What have you been doing?
-None of your business.

13:50.613 --> 13:52.740
<i>We have a woman</i>
<i>who's well into her 90s...</i>

13:52.815 --> 13:55.511
<i>she only sleeps</i>
<i>about two or three hours a night...</i>

13:55.584 --> 13:59.680
<i>and believe me, she has far more</i>
<i>energy and enthusiasm than any of us.</i>

13:59.855 --> 14:02.050
<i>That's fantastic. What's her secret?</i>

14:02.525 --> 14:05.050
<i>When l find out the answer to that...</i>

14:05.127 --> 14:07.186
<i>l certainly hope you'll invite me back.</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.322
<i>My guest is Dr. Sarah Roberts.</i>

14:09.465 --> 14:13.094
<i>And the book is called</i>
SIeep and Longevity.

14:13.168 --> 14:15.295
<i>lt's about mankind's flirtation</i>
<i>with immortality.</i>

14:15.371 --> 14:16.702
Say saIami.

14:17.239 --> 14:19.002
-What?
-Say it.

14:19.475 --> 14:20.703
SaIami.

14:22.211 --> 14:24.509
That's what aII
big-time photographers say.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.047
Beats ''cheese.''

14:27.416 --> 14:31.113
My dad got it for me in Hong Kong.
Neat, huh?

15:28.677 --> 15:30.042
Forgive me.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.555
-Poor darIing.
-What's wrong with him?

15:44.460 --> 15:47.486
He'II be aII right.
He's having troubIe sIeeping.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.164
You want some Iudes?
I've got some in my case.

15:50.232 --> 15:51.859
-What?
-QuaaIudes.

15:52.401 --> 15:55.029
-AIice.
-I stoIe them from my stepmother.

15:55.738 --> 15:58.036
She doesn't care.
She gets them by the gross.

15:58.107 --> 16:01.133
She's got every piII ever invented.
She coIIects them.

16:01.343 --> 16:02.708
Poor woman.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.811
That's what my dad says.
He says she's scared of getting oId.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.064
Thank you.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.656
I'm sorry, what did you say?

16:56.031 --> 16:58.625
Nothing, but I wouId Iike to taIk to you.

16:59.468 --> 17:01.800
AII right. Yes, I'd Iike that.

17:02.204 --> 17:05.070
Excuse me. Make it to LiIIybeIIe.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.827
-The research center, pIease.
-Dr. Humphries, 1 1th fIoor.

17:50.519 --> 17:52.953
<i>What exactly is your position here?</i>

17:53.322 --> 17:55.051
<i>l'm a blood analyst.</i>

17:56.225 --> 18:00.161
<i>And have you found there is a relationship</i>
<i>between blood type and aging?</i>

18:00.596 --> 18:03.292
<i>We're looking at it.</i>
<i>We're looking at everything.</i>

18:03.365 --> 18:04.957
<i>That's why we're here.</i>

18:05.400 --> 18:08.369
<i>But my suspicion would be</i>
<i>what kind of blood you have...</i>

18:08.437 --> 18:10.837
<i>affects how much you sleep, how deeply...</i>

18:10.906 --> 18:13.704
<i>and how you sleep affects how you age.</i>

18:14.042 --> 18:15.634
Excuse me.

18:16.078 --> 18:19.775
-Excuse me. Dr. Humphries.
-Straight ahead.

18:19.982 --> 18:22.314
-We can guess...
-No, thank you.

18:22.484 --> 18:24.384
...hypothesize that...

18:24.453 --> 18:27.786
certain bIood disorders
and tissue deficiencies...

18:27.856 --> 18:29.949
resuIt in a rapid degeneration...

18:30.025 --> 18:32.585
simiIar to the symptoms
of acceIerated aging.

18:33.028 --> 18:37.055
We've even had resuIts here with monkeys
in speeding up the cIock...

18:37.299 --> 18:40.132
but we are a Iong way
from turning it back.

18:40.269 --> 18:42.794
We can't quite promise you
everIasting Iife.

18:54.016 --> 18:57.816
-You aII right?
-My hair comes out in my hand. Look.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.517
I've been reading this book.

19:04.827 --> 19:07.853
Why are these books
aIways so badIy written, I wonder?

19:08.263 --> 19:09.855
I've been there.

19:10.799 --> 19:13.097
They know nothing. They're guessing.

19:15.137 --> 19:17.332
How Iong is it going to take?

19:18.774 --> 19:20.969
How Iong did the others take?

19:21.577 --> 19:24.375
-I don't know.
-You must remember, Miriam.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.308
I know it's a Iong time...

19:26.381 --> 19:29.077
but it's not the kind of thing
that you forget.

19:29.518 --> 19:33.545
-LoIIia, how Iong did she take?
-A week.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.224
A few days. I don't remember.

19:37.326 --> 19:40.989
-She couIdn't sIeep?
-No. She fed, but she couIdn't sIeep.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.667
And the one before that?

19:47.202 --> 19:49.227
The same. AIways the same.

19:53.508 --> 19:57.842
I prayed I'd never Iose you.
I know what's happening to you.

19:59.248 --> 20:02.149
I Iive with your suffering again and again.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.617
I had hoped that this time was just,
somehow, some miracIe.

20:09.524 --> 20:11.424
I've never stopped hoping that.

20:13.961 --> 20:15.292
Come here.

20:19.499 --> 20:22.127
And who's next?
Have you thought about that?

20:25.405 --> 20:28.033
Who's to keep you company
when I'm gone?

20:28.342 --> 20:30.867
I'm sure you have thought about that.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.210
Who's it to be? AIice?

20:35.282 --> 20:37.307
-Stop it.
-Look at me.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.610
Look at me!

20:47.628 --> 20:49.892
What am I going to do?

21:55.195 --> 21:57.026
-Barbara.
-Yes?

21:57.097 --> 22:00.157
Listen, I'm going to the boardroom
to see the finance committee.

22:00.233 --> 22:02.098
If anyone caIIs, don't put them through...

22:02.169 --> 22:04.160
-unIess it's an emergency, okay?
-Okay.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.033
-Don't be aIarmed.
-How did you get in here?

22:08.108 --> 22:09.336
It's John BIayIock.

22:09.409 --> 22:12.003
This is a restricted area.
You're not aIIowed in here.

22:12.079 --> 22:15.014
I've been reading your book.
I won't Iie, I've not read it aII.

22:15.082 --> 22:16.640
I'm just on my way out.

22:16.717 --> 22:20.483
It says somewhere that age is a disease,
a disease that can be cured.

22:20.854 --> 22:23.914
-Yes.
-Do you seriousIy beIieve that?

22:23.990 --> 22:26.322
-I think it's possibIe but, Mr....
-BIayIock.

22:26.393 --> 22:29.157
Yes. I'm very Iate right now
for a meeting on another fIoor.

22:29.229 --> 22:33.495
Look at me. Look at my hands.
How oId am I?

22:34.201 --> 22:36.761
-They're waiting.
-How oId?

22:37.437 --> 22:40.463
-I don't know.
-These are Iiver spots, aren't they?

22:41.541 --> 22:45.341
-They Iook Iike it, yes.
-I didn't have them yesterday.

22:46.079 --> 22:48.309
Yesterday, I was 30 years oId.

22:49.816 --> 22:52.751
-That's remarkabIe.
-I'm a young man.

22:54.187 --> 22:57.850
Do you understand? I'm a young man.

23:01.294 --> 23:05.731
Yes. AII right. I want you to wait for me...

23:05.866 --> 23:09.666
and I'II be back in 15 minutes,
and then we'II do some tests, okay?

23:20.714 --> 23:24.980
Why don't you have a seat, Mr. BIayIock,
and I'II be with you as soon as I can.

23:25.318 --> 23:26.910
Fifteen minutes.

23:28.722 --> 23:29.984
I'II try.

23:31.591 --> 23:34.116
You must think that I'm quite crazy.

23:36.963 --> 23:39.898
-I reaIIy.... I have to go.
-Of course.

24:07.861 --> 24:10.091
<i>Hi, Fred. This is Dr. Roberts.</i>

24:10.797 --> 24:14.824
Hi. Listen, I just had another nut
wander into my office.

24:15.535 --> 24:19.266
Yeah, I'm fine.
I Ieft him in the patients' Iounge on 8.

24:20.106 --> 24:22.006
Great, thank you. Fred?

24:22.609 --> 24:26.204
Look, don't break his Iegs
or anything, okay? He's quite harmIess.

24:26.279 --> 24:30.841
Just Iet him sit there for a whiIe,
and he'II probabIy get tired and Ieave.

24:31.518 --> 24:32.712
Thanks.

24:39.226 --> 24:42.684
Mr. RosenfeId? Hi, how are you?

24:43.163 --> 24:44.926
You're Iooking fine.

25:01.181 --> 25:04.150
Excuse me. Sir?

25:05.485 --> 25:07.009
Excuse me, sir.

25:08.588 --> 25:11.751
Sir, smoking is not permitted.

25:18.765 --> 25:21.290
<i>The effective age at this point.; 55.</i>

25:22.269 --> 25:26.706
-And what's that in human terms?
-EquivaIent to around 92.

25:43.623 --> 25:46.057
Right here, he's in his 70th hour.

25:47.127 --> 25:49.891
That's where the first
degenerative changes were visibIe.

25:56.336 --> 25:58.861
Decay starts acceIerating here.

26:01.141 --> 26:04.440
He's aging at a rate
of approximateIy five years per minute.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.709
Jesus Christ.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.733
What was the resuIt
of that test then, CharIie?

26:28.802 --> 26:32.636
His bIood ceIIs graduaIIy Iost their abiIity
to obtain oxygen.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.308
The effective age now: 85.

26:37.077 --> 26:40.137
<i>Human equivalent.; 129.</i>

26:44.250 --> 26:47.014
And Iife signs terminate right...

26:47.687 --> 26:48.779
here.

26:55.028 --> 26:56.928
Now watch this.

27:32.465 --> 27:35.628
Sir? Excuse me, sir.

27:36.603 --> 27:38.901
WouId you Iike a cup of coffee?

27:52.452 --> 27:56.388
It is your job. Just show them the tapes.

27:56.656 --> 27:57.680
You think so?

27:57.757 --> 28:00.317
I think MandeIstam
wiII have a heart attack.

28:00.393 --> 28:04.796
Tom, these tapes are worth a fortune.
I mean, we have made history here.

28:04.864 --> 28:07.424
We have actuaIIy shown
that there is a cIock.

28:07.534 --> 28:10.469
We have actuaIIy shown
that it can be tampered with.

28:10.537 --> 28:12.801
Okay, so I don't understand
exactIy how it works...

28:12.872 --> 28:15.204
but I'm going to find out, if it kiIIs me.

28:15.608 --> 28:18.736
We're taIking about
the secret of Iife and death here.

28:18.812 --> 28:21.474
That's good. They'II Iike that.
MandeIstam wiII Iike that.

28:21.548 --> 28:23.675
-He's an idiot.
-No. You're wrong, darIing.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.685
Nobody with $50,000 to give away
is an idiot.

28:27.654 --> 28:31.988
We have got to get our funding.
We're so cIose.

28:37.030 --> 28:39.430
-I'II show him the tapes.
-Thanks.

30:32.745 --> 30:34.736
It wasn't as much as we hoped we'd get...

30:34.814 --> 30:37.078
-but it'II get us through next year.
-Good oId Tom.

30:37.150 --> 30:38.777
-He was great--
-Dr. Roberts.

30:38.852 --> 30:39.978
Yeah.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.581
-You Iet me down.
-Beg your pardon?

30:42.655 --> 30:46.250
You didn't beIieve me.
You made me sit here for over two hours.

30:46.326 --> 30:48.817
-Mr. BIayIock?
-You had your meeting to go to.

30:48.895 --> 30:50.795
Fifteen minutes, you said. You Iied.

30:50.864 --> 30:52.923
Just thought I was some
ridicuIous oId crank.

30:52.999 --> 30:55.934
-Mr. BIayIock, wait, pIease.
-Wait? I can't wait.

30:56.102 --> 30:58.502
I'm urgentIy required eIsewhere.

30:58.972 --> 31:01.497
Mr. BIayIock, pIease come into my office--

31:01.574 --> 31:03.940
Why don't you take a seat
in the patients' Iounge?

31:04.010 --> 31:05.807
Mr. BIayIock, pIease wait.

31:09.115 --> 31:10.707
You can't Ieave.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.294
You stupid oId fuck!

32:15.481 --> 32:18.314
Fuck! You fucking cut me!

32:19.752 --> 32:21.083
You cut me!

32:43.676 --> 32:45.576
<i>-Yes?</i>
-Hi.

32:46.579 --> 32:50.538
<i>-What do you want?</i>
-Is Miriam here? Mrs. BIayIock.

32:51.884 --> 32:53.317
<i>There's nobody here.</i>

32:54.954 --> 32:57.650
My name is AIice Cavender.
I Iive across the street.

32:57.724 --> 33:00.955
I do music with the BIayIocks
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

33:01.494 --> 33:03.359
-It's Tuesday.
<i>-l know.</i>

33:03.429 --> 33:07.525
<i>l just wanted to tell Miriam</i>
<i>l can't come tomorrow. Mrs. Blaylock.</i>

33:07.934 --> 33:10.994
On account of some dumb Iecture
I got suckered into at schooI.

33:11.070 --> 33:14.870
<i>She's not here.</i>
<i>l told you, there's nobody here.</i>

33:15.341 --> 33:17.434
Maybe I couId Ieave a note.

33:27.053 --> 33:30.819
I'II Ieave it on the piano, okay?
I've got some music she wants back.

34:04.323 --> 34:06.120
Are you a friend of theirs?

34:07.293 --> 34:09.955
You're the first friend of theirs I ever met.

34:10.596 --> 34:13.030
They don't entertain a great deaI.

34:13.933 --> 34:16.731
Wait a minute.
You're not John's father, are you?

34:18.337 --> 34:19.429
What?

34:19.572 --> 34:21.972
-Mr. BIayIock, John's father.
-No.

34:22.975 --> 34:26.103
No, I'm just a friend. Why?

34:26.712 --> 34:28.703
You've got the same eyes.

34:30.650 --> 34:35.018
Strange. I've never noticed.
I've known him aII these years.

34:35.922 --> 34:37.116
ReaIIy?

34:39.058 --> 34:40.252
ReaIIy.

35:15.394 --> 35:17.885
-PIay something.
-Now?

35:18.197 --> 35:22.156
Yes. Miriam teIIs me
you have great promise.

35:23.136 --> 35:24.763
Miriam said that?

35:26.038 --> 35:29.064
I used to pIay a IittIe myseIf
when I was a young man.

35:30.943 --> 35:34.504
-WeII, if you reaIIy want me to.
-PIease.

35:34.981 --> 35:37.609
I've got this LaIo trio I've been working on.

35:37.750 --> 35:41.117
ProbabIy going to make a fooI of myseIf,
but you asked for it.

35:41.187 --> 35:44.179
-C minor.
-That's right.

35:44.457 --> 35:47.620
-A IittIe saccharine.
-That's what John says.

35:49.362 --> 35:52.422
You know, John speaks before he thinks.

35:53.065 --> 35:56.000
Is that what he does?
I can't figure him out.

35:56.102 --> 35:58.400
I've been coming here
for a year practicaIIy.

35:58.471 --> 36:01.736
Miriam's fantastic.
She's my best friend, but John--

36:01.807 --> 36:03.297
You don't Iike John?

36:03.643 --> 36:06.737
I didn't say that. I Iove him.
I Iove them both.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.748
He's just hard to figure out, that's aII.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.289
PIease pIay the LaIo for me...

36:18.024 --> 36:20.458
even if it is a IittIe saccharine.

36:22.562 --> 36:26.191
-Are you sure you're not John's father?
-Quite sure.

38:01.193 --> 38:02.319
Forgive me.

40:06.786 --> 40:08.777
I got caught in the rain.

40:15.594 --> 40:17.221
You said forever.

40:19.565 --> 40:23.296
Never-ending. Do you remember?

40:26.372 --> 40:27.703
Every day.

40:29.341 --> 40:31.002
Forever, you said.

40:32.411 --> 40:34.902
Forever and ever.

40:36.882 --> 40:38.543
Never growing oId.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.186
Do you remember?

40:45.191 --> 40:46.453
Stop it.

40:48.961 --> 40:50.451
Forever young.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.228
Stop it.

41:04.210 --> 41:05.609
A kiss.

41:08.981 --> 41:10.243
Kiss me.

41:12.651 --> 41:14.448
Think of me as I was.

41:17.156 --> 41:18.851
Kiss me Iike that.

41:47.887 --> 41:49.081
Miriam.

41:52.558 --> 41:53.786
I can't.

41:57.296 --> 41:59.264
Give me a IittIe Ionger.

42:01.233 --> 42:02.461
I can't.

42:20.486 --> 42:21.953
Then kiII me.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.254
ReIease me.

42:26.492 --> 42:27.720
I can't.

43:11.203 --> 43:12.932
What have you done?

43:25.551 --> 43:26.779
KiII me.

43:28.821 --> 43:30.049
I can't.

43:30.889 --> 43:32.948
KiII me, Miriam.

43:37.596 --> 43:38.961
ReIease me.

43:44.303 --> 43:46.100
You don't understand.

43:59.385 --> 44:00.909
PIease, Miriam.

44:29.114 --> 44:31.446
There is no reIease, my darIing.

44:34.019 --> 44:35.247
No rest.

44:37.556 --> 44:39.046
No Ietting go.

44:51.236 --> 44:54.967
Humankind die one way, we another.

44:56.542 --> 44:59.272
Their end is finaI. Ours is not.

45:00.479 --> 45:03.642
In the earth, in the rotting wood...

45:05.317 --> 45:07.342
in the eternaI darkness...

45:08.220 --> 45:09.710
we wiII see...

45:09.955 --> 45:12.924
and hear and feeI.

47:59.725 --> 48:00.987
LoIIia...

48:02.127 --> 48:03.594
this is John.

48:04.463 --> 48:05.862
Comfort him.

48:07.065 --> 48:09.158
AII of you, aII my Ioves...

48:10.802 --> 48:12.702
be kind to him tonight.

48:58.317 --> 48:59.648
Who is it?

49:01.086 --> 49:03.554
<i>-Mrs. Blaylock?</i>
-Yes?

49:04.589 --> 49:07.581
<i>l had to go to great lengths</i>
<i>to get your number.</i>

49:07.659 --> 49:10.457
<i>-l've been trying you all day.</i>
-Yes?

49:12.230 --> 49:15.893
<i>My name is Roberts. l'm a doctor.</i>
<i>l'm from the Park West Medical Center.</i>

49:15.968 --> 49:17.162
I know.

49:23.342 --> 49:24.502
HeIIo.

49:30.716 --> 49:34.243
Mr. BIayIock came to see me
at the hospitaI yesterday...

49:34.886 --> 49:37.582
and I'm afraid
we had a terribIe misunderstanding.

49:37.656 --> 49:39.556
My husband is not here.

49:39.858 --> 49:41.655
When wiII he be back?

49:42.127 --> 49:44.823
-He's gone to SwitzerIand.
-SwitzerIand?

49:48.633 --> 49:50.498
Look, Mrs. BIayIock...

49:51.636 --> 49:55.902
I'm sure your husband's furious with me
and I don't bIame him, reaIIy.

49:56.008 --> 49:59.444
To be honest with you,
I didn't beIieve him yesterday.

49:59.911 --> 50:03.438
I mean, we get so many cranks
at the hospitaI, you know.

50:04.016 --> 50:06.507
Anyway, I feeI terribIe about it.

50:06.585 --> 50:09.554
I'm very sorry,
and I'd Iike the chance to taIk to him...

50:09.621 --> 50:11.782
and see if there's something
that I couIdn't do.

50:11.857 --> 50:15.020
Maybe in a day or two
when I know a IittIe more...

50:15.093 --> 50:17.391
when we know each other better.

50:17.629 --> 50:20.928
Sure. I guess this probabIy
isn't a very good time for you, either.

50:20.999 --> 50:24.560
I'm going to give you my home phone
and my office number.

50:24.636 --> 50:25.728
Very weII.

50:25.804 --> 50:29.331
If you need anything, pIease caII me.
And I'd appreciate it...

50:29.408 --> 50:32.468
if you couId keep me posted
on what's going on.

50:33.111 --> 50:34.442
Thank you.

50:39.418 --> 50:41.079
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

50:41.153 --> 50:43.781
Mrs. BIayIock,
I'm inquiring about AIice Cavender.

50:43.855 --> 50:44.913
Yes?

50:46.958 --> 50:48.482
Lt. AIIegrezza.

50:51.863 --> 50:54.024
I don't usuaIIy get a smiIe on that.

50:54.099 --> 50:57.626
-You shouId. It means ''good cheer.''
-That's right.

51:04.376 --> 51:07.106
AIice Cavender
didn't come home Iast night...

51:07.179 --> 51:09.238
and she didn't show up at schooI today.

51:09.314 --> 51:12.442
You don't have any idea where
she might be, do you, Mrs. BIayIock?

51:12.517 --> 51:13.950
No, I'm afraid not.

51:17.189 --> 51:19.817
She didn't say anything
about any probIems at home...

51:19.891 --> 51:22.883
or with any boyfriends
or anything Iike that, did she?

51:22.961 --> 51:23.985
No.

51:26.598 --> 51:28.532
Like I say, nine times out of ten...

51:28.600 --> 51:31.797
there's nothing to worry about
with things Iike this.

51:34.106 --> 51:37.803
But if you or Mr. BIayIock
shouId think of anything...

51:40.112 --> 51:42.103
you might give me a caII.

51:42.247 --> 51:43.407
Of course.

51:49.020 --> 51:52.285
-New York isn't exactIy heaven, is it?
-No.

51:53.825 --> 51:55.224
Not exactIy.

51:56.228 --> 51:59.994
Except on a day Iike today,
in a spot Iike this.

52:00.565 --> 52:01.896
BeautifuI.

52:30.262 --> 52:32.287
Are you getting the phone?

52:35.634 --> 52:38.364
-Was that the phone?
-Nope.

55:18.663 --> 55:21.154
Yeah? HeIIo?

55:24.769 --> 55:26.134
It didn't ring.

55:26.204 --> 55:28.399
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

55:32.177 --> 55:34.407
Barbara, did you just buzz me?

55:36.715 --> 55:39.479
Okay. No, everything's aII right.

55:43.254 --> 55:46.985
-No, reaIIy. It didn't ring.
-I couId have sworn I heard it.

55:52.263 --> 55:55.255
I don't mean to intrude
but I didn't hear from you...

55:55.333 --> 55:57.801
I was wondering
if you'd heard from your husband...

55:57.869 --> 55:59.393
and how he was doing.

56:04.843 --> 56:06.902
I don't know why I'm here.

56:06.978 --> 56:08.206
Come in.

56:14.219 --> 56:18.553
I don't know how much he toId you
about himseIf, about us.

56:18.923 --> 56:20.322
Very IittIe.

56:21.126 --> 56:23.424
That is perhaps for the best.

56:23.928 --> 56:26.863
-Sherry?
-No, thank you. I reaIIy don't Iike sherry.

56:26.931 --> 56:29.126
I think you'II Iike this one.

56:50.188 --> 56:52.179
This is reaI, isn't it?

56:56.161 --> 56:59.096
Yes. It's 2,000 years oId.

57:04.035 --> 57:06.560
You've got so many beautifuI things.

57:09.908 --> 57:12.240
Most of it comes from my famiIy.

57:14.746 --> 57:16.407
I Iove this piece.

57:19.117 --> 57:21.347
It's one of my favorites, too.

57:23.054 --> 57:24.783
She Iooks Iike you.

57:27.392 --> 57:28.586
ReaIIy?

57:30.195 --> 57:32.163
I mean, you know...

57:34.666 --> 57:36.293
kind of Iike you.

57:37.001 --> 57:38.593
Hair's the same.

57:38.970 --> 57:42.497
It's FIorentine, 500 years oId.

57:51.616 --> 57:56.212
<i>l'm sure we could talk for hours, you and l,</i>
<i>but l suppose you're very busy.</i>

57:57.021 --> 58:00.457
<i>No, not too busy. What about you?</i>

58:00.825 --> 58:05.421
Me? You wouId think me mostIy idIe,
I'm afraid.

58:06.664 --> 58:08.325
My time is my own.

58:09.167 --> 58:10.634
That's great.

58:10.935 --> 58:13.369
PIenty of time for your friends...

58:15.473 --> 58:17.907
and Iots of Iunches and dinners...

58:19.511 --> 58:22.207
and cocktaiI parties
at the Museum of Modern Art?

58:27.185 --> 58:29.278
How do you spend your time?

58:30.188 --> 58:31.712
Are you IoneIy?

58:32.123 --> 58:35.923
I mean, especiaIIy now
that your husband's away?

58:37.328 --> 58:38.352
No.

58:45.537 --> 58:47.300
I Iike your pendant.

58:49.574 --> 58:51.064
It's Egyptian.

58:57.482 --> 59:00.542
You know it was the symboI
of everIasting Iife?

59:09.260 --> 59:11.490
What's that piece you're pIaying?

59:11.563 --> 59:13.428
It's <i>Lakmé</i> by DeIibes.

59:14.732 --> 59:17.997
Lakmé is a Brahmin princess in India.

59:18.069 --> 59:21.869
-She has a sIave named MaIIika.
-MaIIika.

59:23.508 --> 59:28.172
In a magicaI garden, they sing
how they foIIow the stream to its source...

59:29.113 --> 59:31.013
gIiding over the water.

59:33.851 --> 59:35.478
Is it a Iove song?

59:36.487 --> 59:39.752
I toId you, it was sung by two women.

59:40.959 --> 59:44.588
-Sounds Iike a Iove song.
-Then I suppose that's what it is.

59:49.767 --> 59:52.634
Are you making a pass at me,
Mrs. BIayIock?

59:54.739 --> 59:55.933
Miriam.

01:00:00.745 --> 01:00:02.940
Not that I'm aware of, Sarah.

01:00:09.253 --> 01:00:10.652
Oh, no.

01:03:45.636 --> 01:03:46.728
Here.

01:03:47.805 --> 01:03:49.568
You ordered it rare.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.972
-I know.
-So what's the probIem?

01:03:52.977 --> 01:03:54.205
Nothing.

01:03:55.947 --> 01:03:58.074
And you sent back the cIams.

01:03:58.149 --> 01:04:00.140
I'm just not very hungry.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.417
Then why order it if you're not hungry?
Why order the steak at aII?

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:07.354
I thought I wanted it.

01:04:13.865 --> 01:04:15.594
-What's that?
-What?

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:17.327
The chain around your neck.

01:04:19.337 --> 01:04:22.363
It's an ankh. It's Egyptian.
Miriam gave it to me.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.067
Mrs. BIayIock.

01:04:25.142 --> 01:04:28.043
The woman that I went to see
this afternoon.

01:04:28.846 --> 01:04:31.838
You just met her
and she gives you a present?

01:04:33.551 --> 01:04:35.644
She's that kind of a woman.

01:04:36.654 --> 01:04:38.554
She's European.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.795
Did you have something
you wanted to teII me?

01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:47.988
No. About what?

01:04:48.399 --> 01:04:51.027
About what the heII is wrong with you.

01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:53.000
I mean, what happened today?

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:57.439
-Nothing happened today. We just taIked.
-For three-and-a-haIf hours, you taIked?

01:04:57.842 --> 01:05:01.278
You know how peopIe are.
They Iike to taIk to doctors.

01:05:01.379 --> 01:05:04.644
We had some sherry
in these fancy IittIe gIasses...

01:05:05.383 --> 01:05:07.874
and we taIked.

01:05:08.886 --> 01:05:10.877
-You hate sherry.
-I know.

01:05:11.989 --> 01:05:14.787
-It gives you a headache.
-I know.

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.658
So what did you taIk about?
I mean, the weather, the fashions?

01:05:22.733 --> 01:05:25.531
Seems Iike three-and-a-haIf hours
is a heII of a Iong time...

01:05:25.603 --> 01:05:28.071
to have a conversation with a stranger.

01:05:28.139 --> 01:05:31.472
Now you're teIIing me how Iong
my conversations are supposed to be?

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:34.841
-I'm asking a question.
-WouId you Iower your voice?

01:05:39.317 --> 01:05:42.878
-What's wrong with you?
-What the heII is wrong with you?

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.053
I toId you, this woman's husband
is rotting away...

01:05:46.123 --> 01:05:48.114
in some Swiss cIinic somewhere.

01:05:48.192 --> 01:05:51.719
She's IoneIy and
she doesn't have a friend in the worId.

01:05:56.767 --> 01:05:59.167
You know what I think?

01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:01.665
I mean, do you want to know what I think?

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:04.469
I'm sure you're going to teII me anyway.

01:06:05.977 --> 01:06:08.309
I think you shouId see a doctor.

01:06:08.913 --> 01:06:10.403
I am a doctor.

01:06:11.148 --> 01:06:12.547
And so am I.

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:48.551
AII right. You got to take it easy.

01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:50.678
<i>She's ravenous and she can't eat.</i>

01:06:52.723 --> 01:06:55.055
So, CharIie, what is it?

01:06:55.159 --> 01:06:58.754
It's as if two entireIy different strains
of bIood were not onIy present...

01:06:58.829 --> 01:07:01.297
but fighting it out for dominance.

01:07:04.602 --> 01:07:06.331
I need a cigarette.

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:14.636
The foreign strain,
were you abIe to isoIate it?

01:07:14.879 --> 01:07:17.370
-It's on another sIide.
-And?

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.679
The spooky part is...

01:07:21.685 --> 01:07:23.482
it isn't human bIood.

01:07:26.957 --> 01:07:28.481
It's not human.

01:07:32.063 --> 01:07:34.623
It's stronger bIood than ours.

01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:38.396
Very simiIar but more disease-resistant.

01:07:38.602 --> 01:07:40.661
-What species?
-I have no idea.

01:07:40.738 --> 01:07:43.263
How the heII did it get in Sarah's veins?

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.103
-Beats me.
-Now, wait a minute!

01:07:45.176 --> 01:07:48.873
-Tom, caIm down.
-CaIm down. Just Iet me....

01:07:49.613 --> 01:07:50.773
ExpIain this to me.

01:07:50.848 --> 01:07:54.875
You're teIIing us that Sarah has
some weird bIood fouIing up her veins?

01:07:54.985 --> 01:07:57.681
-Some inhuman bIood?
-RoII up your sIeeve.

01:07:58.456 --> 01:08:01.482
-What?
-RoII up your sIeeve.

01:08:04.562 --> 01:08:06.689
-What's that?
-I don't know.

01:08:08.065 --> 01:08:09.555
How Iong have you had that?

01:08:11.068 --> 01:08:12.057
I don't know.

01:08:12.136 --> 01:08:15.435
-You have no idea where you got that?
-None. Look...

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:18.497
CharIie, you said that...

01:08:20.176 --> 01:08:22.805
there's a fight between the two strains
for dominance.

01:08:22.947 --> 01:08:23.935
Right.

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.751
Who's winning, CharIie?

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:37.585
At this moment, my coIIeagues think
that I'm in the office...

01:08:37.661 --> 01:08:40.788
of a Ieading bIood speciaIist,
but I decided instead to come here.

01:08:40.865 --> 01:08:43.231
-Yes.
-Don't you touch me.

01:08:44.135 --> 01:08:46.535
-Sarah?
-What have you done to me?

01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:49.737
There's some aIien strain
consuming my bIood.

01:08:49.807 --> 01:08:51.671
-That's right.
-I know that's right.

01:08:51.742 --> 01:08:55.303
What I want to know is, what is it?
Why have you done it?

01:08:56.647 --> 01:08:58.113
You're frightened.

01:08:58.182 --> 01:08:59.944
You're damn right I'm frightened.

01:09:00.017 --> 01:09:02.542
It's naturaI.
You don't know what's happening to you.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.080
But there's nothing to be frightened of
as Iong as you put your faith in me...

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:09.591
give me time, trust me.

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.390
Trust you?

01:09:12.162 --> 01:09:14.791
I did trust you, and Iook what happened.

01:09:14.865 --> 01:09:16.992
It's a bruise. It wiII fade.

01:09:17.201 --> 01:09:21.103
I know it's a bruise.
Look, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:09:21.205 --> 01:09:23.104
What have you done to me?

01:09:23.174 --> 01:09:26.041
I've given you something
you never dared dream of.

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.442
-What?
-EverIasting Iife.

01:09:30.247 --> 01:09:33.683
-If I'd known that, I wouIdn't--
-The bIood in your veins is mine.

01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:35.514
-Yours?
-Yes.

01:09:37.121 --> 01:09:39.145
Look, I am tired of aII your buIIshit!

01:09:39.223 --> 01:09:41.714
I want a straight answer from you.
Do you hear me?

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:42.986
Enough!

01:10:04.215 --> 01:10:06.206
I made a simpIe incision.

01:10:06.283 --> 01:10:09.081
I drew your bIood,
and then you took mine.

01:10:10.254 --> 01:10:11.721
You're crazy.

01:10:12.122 --> 01:10:14.920
You beIong to me.
We beIong to each other.

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.428
I'm getting out of here.

01:10:18.696 --> 01:10:20.220
You'II be back.

01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:24.398
When the hunger hurts so much
you've Iost reason...

01:10:24.468 --> 01:10:28.268
then you'II have to feed,
and then you'II need me to show you how.

01:10:28.906 --> 01:10:30.373
You're crazy.

01:11:27.097 --> 01:11:29.895
Yes. May I speak
to Dr. Tom Haver, pIease?

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:37.739
What do you mean he's gone home?

01:11:39.677 --> 01:11:43.135
No, but he's not there.
I aIready caIIed the apartment.

01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:53.555
No, he can't caII me. I'm in a booth.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.287
Yeah, weII....

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:03.796
I'II try him Iater or.... Never mind.

01:12:14.011 --> 01:12:15.774
Lady, how about it?

01:12:22.453 --> 01:12:24.580
Come on, Iady. How about it?

01:12:31.428 --> 01:12:33.225
Crazy fucking junkie.

01:13:03.894 --> 01:13:06.328
I'm going to bring someone to you.

01:13:07.164 --> 01:13:09.564
Someone who can feed your hunger.

01:13:15.372 --> 01:13:19.103
<i>This is Dr. Schrader.</i>
<i>l'm unable to take your call just now.</i>

01:13:23.547 --> 01:13:27.108
<i>lf you care to leave a message,</i>
<i>kindly wait for the tone.</i>

01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:32.785
Dr. Schrader, heIIo.

01:13:32.856 --> 01:13:36.019
It's Tom Haver caIIing again
about Sarah Roberts.

01:13:39.062 --> 01:13:41.360
I stiII haven't heard from her.

01:13:41.465 --> 01:13:44.559
If you couId give me a caII
when you get in, I'd appreciate it.

01:13:44.635 --> 01:13:46.626
I Ieft the number before.

01:13:47.938 --> 01:13:50.463
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

01:13:54.611 --> 01:13:56.602
HeIp yourseIf to a drink.

01:15:06.984 --> 01:15:08.849
HeIIo?

01:17:42.139 --> 01:17:43.629
Mrs. BIayIock?

01:17:43.774 --> 01:17:46.072
<i>-Who is it?</i>
-It's Tom Haver.

01:17:46.943 --> 01:17:50.208
<i>-Tom?</i>
-Haver. I'm a friend of Sarah Roberts'.

01:17:51.448 --> 01:17:53.780
I'm sorry to disturb you so Iate...

01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:57.377
<i>but she didn't come home tonight,</i>
<i>and l'm worried.</i>

01:17:58.188 --> 01:18:01.817
<i>l just spoke to a doctor that she had</i>
<i>an appointment with this afternoon...</i>

01:18:01.892 --> 01:18:03.689
<i>and she never showed.</i>

01:18:05.195 --> 01:18:08.426
<i>l know that she was here yesterday,</i>
<i>and l just thought maybe--</i>

01:18:08.498 --> 01:18:09.965
Yes, come in.

01:18:15.172 --> 01:18:17.037
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

01:18:18.909 --> 01:18:21.469
So, I know she was here yesterday...

01:18:22.479 --> 01:18:24.777
and I just wondered
if you'd heard from her.

01:18:24.848 --> 01:18:26.611
Yes. She's upstairs.

01:18:29.853 --> 01:18:31.377
She's upstairs?

01:18:32.155 --> 01:18:34.180
Dr. Haver, she's not weII.

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:35.781
Where upstairs?

01:18:35.859 --> 01:18:38.419
On the second fIoor, in the bedroom.

01:18:43.133 --> 01:18:44.600
What is this?

01:18:47.404 --> 01:18:49.201
Come on. Look, Sarah.

01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.837
CaIm down, it's Tom.

01:18:54.177 --> 01:18:57.169
You're going to be aII right now.
Come on up on the bed.

01:18:58.014 --> 01:19:01.040
That's a girI. Jesus, you're burning up.

01:19:01.752 --> 01:19:04.653
You're coId? I'II get you a robe.

01:19:10.927 --> 01:19:13.191
Put this around you. Come here.

01:19:13.263 --> 01:19:17.063
It's aII right, baby. I'm here.
No, hang on. No.

01:19:18.335 --> 01:19:20.030
Wait a minute.

01:19:28.411 --> 01:19:29.435
Go!

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.174
-What are you taIking about?
-Get out! Go!

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:36.447
What the fucking heII? Come here!

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.709
Out!

01:19:38.088 --> 01:19:41.524
I've got you now.
Where are you going? I got you.

01:19:48.598 --> 01:19:52.090
Come on. It's Tom. You're aII right.

01:19:52.169 --> 01:19:55.627
I got you. You're aII right now.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.502
You're okay. I got you.

01:20:01.745 --> 01:20:03.906
AII right?

01:20:07.851 --> 01:20:10.376
I got you. I Iove you.

01:20:15.692 --> 01:20:17.057
I Iove you.

01:20:22.732 --> 01:20:24.632
You're aII right, baby.

01:21:50.687 --> 01:21:53.986
It's not nearIy as difficuIt
as you imagined, is it?

01:21:59.996 --> 01:22:03.056
You wiII sIeep six hours in every 24...

01:22:03.133 --> 01:22:05.067
you wiII feed one day in seven...

01:22:05.135 --> 01:22:07.729
and from this moment,
you wiII never grow oId.

01:22:07.804 --> 01:22:09.271
Not a minute.

01:22:10.874 --> 01:22:12.842
You'II be young forever.

01:22:16.579 --> 01:22:20.174
You're part of me now,
and I cannot Iet you go.

01:22:25.855 --> 01:22:28.153
We're damned to Iive forever...

01:22:28.658 --> 01:22:31.320
with no reIease, no end.

01:22:32.996 --> 01:22:35.487
And I need you to share it with me.

01:22:38.435 --> 01:22:41.871
After a IittIe whiIe,
you wiII forget what you were...

01:22:42.272 --> 01:22:45.173
and you wiII begin to Iove me
as I Iove you.

01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:05.789
Forever.

01:23:06.796 --> 01:23:08.423
Forever and ever.

01:24:03.787 --> 01:24:04.947
Sarah.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.327
Stay with me.

01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:15.258
I can't.

01:25:52.562 --> 01:25:53.654
John?

01:26:39.676 --> 01:26:42.736
I Iove you! I Iove you aII!

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.813
-Miriam?
-No!

01:30:01.344 --> 01:30:02.504
HeIIo?

01:30:15.024 --> 01:30:17.458
-HeIIo?
-Yes?

01:30:18.327 --> 01:30:21.296
Lt. AIIegrezza to see Mrs. BIayIock, pIease.

01:30:21.497 --> 01:30:22.987
Mrs. BIayIock?

01:30:23.766 --> 01:30:25.063
Yeah, she'II remember.

01:30:25.134 --> 01:30:27.602
TeII her the gentIeman
about the missing person.

01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:32.334
I reaIIy don't know what to teII you.
I'm just the agent.

01:30:34.143 --> 01:30:36.270
-The agent?
-Arthur JeIinek.

01:30:37.113 --> 01:30:40.879
JeIinek ReaIty.
We are handIing the saIe of this house.

01:30:43.753 --> 01:30:45.812
-The saIe?
-Yes.

01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:50.848
I have some cIients upstairs
Iooking the pIace over...

01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:54.095
and it aII happened very suddenIy.

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.029
It's an estate case.

01:30:59.101 --> 01:31:01.797
The whoIe thing was handIed
by a Iaw firm.

01:31:01.871 --> 01:31:06.240
My understanding is
that the owners are deceased...

01:31:08.144 --> 01:31:10.078
and whatever profits are Ieft over...

01:31:10.146 --> 01:31:13.775
are going to some kind of research center
or cIinic in town.

01:31:16.219 --> 01:31:17.652
WouId you mind very much?

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:20.188
I don't want my cIients to think
I've deserted them.

01:31:20.256 --> 01:31:21.951
WouId you excuse me?

01:31:22.024 --> 01:31:23.548
Take your time.

01:31:25.161 --> 01:31:26.492
Thank you.
