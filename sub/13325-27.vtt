WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
So the vietnamese
carjacker that used
to do my nails

00:00.001 --> 00:06.638
Just got out
and now I don't have
anyone to do my pedicure.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.374
I'm so sorry.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.110
I hope the guy who does your
waxing is in here for life.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.481
Hey, wayne, anything
you want to talk about?

00:15.483 --> 00:18.751
Nope, I'm good.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.753
You've been staring
at the wall for the last
40 minutes.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.188
You want to turn your chair
around and join the group?

00:23.190 --> 00:26.625
No, thank you.
If I look anybody
in the face,

00:26.627 --> 00:29.528
I'll just want
to bite their eyes out.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.331
Oh, come on, wayne,
I'd like to think that
you and I have

00:32.333 --> 00:35.134
Developed a bond
of mutual trust.

00:39.572 --> 00:42.674
The problem is,
they want to add another
18 months to my sentence.

00:42.676 --> 00:46.078
So instead of being here
until 2144,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.449
I guess you'll be stuck here
until September 2145.

00:50.451 --> 00:53.185
( all laugh )

00:53.187 --> 00:56.055
It's not funny.

00:56.057 --> 00:59.458
I'm gonna miss another
beach season, charlie.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.460
So why did they change
your release date?

01:01.462 --> 01:04.596
Well, they reclassified one
of my murders as a hate crime

01:04.598 --> 01:06.231
<i>'cause the victim was</i>
<i>half cherokee.</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.700
I'd never kill a man
'cause of the color of his skin.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.236
That's true wayne.
According to your file...

01:13.440 --> 01:16.308
That is about
the only reason

01:16.310 --> 01:18.644
You haven't killed.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.613
We're all the same
on the inside.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.083
At least
from what I've seen.

01:33.493 --> 01:36.361
( beeps )

01:36.363 --> 01:38.764
Excuse me, miss,
do you have any piercings
down there?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.433
Hey, hey, bruce,
how about phrasing that
a little less personal,

01:41.435 --> 01:45.704
Like, "excuse me, miss,
do you have a chandelier
in your foyer?"

01:45.706 --> 01:48.407
That's very sweet,
but these are just
my earrings.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.142
Okay, just right
through that door.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.743
Thank you.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.846
I mean, he kinda jumped
to conclusions, didn't he?

01:53.848 --> 01:55.314
I know, but...

01:55.316 --> 01:57.483
He was right.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.852
These are decoys.

01:59.854 --> 02:03.122
You have my
complete attention.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.859
- Charlie.
- Wynona.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.695
Look, I wish I could talk,
but I'm here visiting
my brother scooter.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.898
I was gonna see
if you wanted to grab
a cup of coffee.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.268
You know,
sure.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.736
Scooter's not going
anywhere.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.406
He tried that once,
but they caught him.

02:21.408 --> 02:24.443
I need to warn you, though,
the coffee shop's not nearly
as exciting as this place.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.178
There's no one there
patting you down

02:26.180 --> 02:28.180
Or checking for piercings.

02:28.182 --> 02:31.250
Unless I really knock this
coffee thing outta the park.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.654
You know, wynona,

02:35.656 --> 02:38.323
We've been sleeping together
for a couple of weeks now.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.593
I think it's about time
we went and got that coffee.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.696
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:46.533 --> 02:48.567
Thanks for coming out
with me, patrick.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.569
I've been feeling
kinda lonely lately.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.838
I'm between relationships
myself,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.908
But I tend to eat away
my depression.

02:55.910 --> 02:58.744
That's why I've never been
"six-pack abs gay."

02:58.746 --> 03:02.447
I'm more "mini cooper
sweater vest gay."

03:02.449 --> 03:05.684
Hey, nolan,
can I get you guys
a couple beers?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.885
Thanks, daley.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.488
By the way,
did you ask?

03:09.490 --> 03:12.491
Yeah, but my boss,
he's not gonna put
pizza rolls on the menu.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.359
But if you
want pizza rolls,

03:14.361 --> 03:16.295
You can always come to
my place tomorrow night.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.830
I have a microwave
and a jacuzzi.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.400
I can't make it.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.335
But I'd definitely use
the microwave to make
the pizza rolls.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.471
The jacuzzi will just
make them all soggy.

03:26.473 --> 03:29.908
Sure, I'll get you guys
those beers.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.710
Are you nuts?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.979
You just said
you're lonely,

03:33.981 --> 03:36.515
And she was blatantly
hitting on you.

03:36.517 --> 03:40.219
Actually, I have plans
with lacey tomorrow night.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.221
She's gonna be getting
undressed by her window,

03:42.223 --> 03:44.223
And I'm gonna be
in my car watching.

03:44.225 --> 03:47.793
That's not "plans with lacey,"
that's a misdemeanor.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.729
It's not like
she doesn't know
I'm out there.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.498
It's an unspoken game
we've been playing
for months.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.666
You're delusional.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.568
Come and see
for yourself.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.270
I will,
but only to prove to you

03:58.272 --> 04:00.239
That you're living
in a fantasy world.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.641
And you just passed up
a real opportunity

04:02.643 --> 04:04.509
With a great girl
like daley

04:04.511 --> 04:08.280
For some bizarre stoner
version of "rear window."

04:10.817 --> 04:13.252
Ernesto,
you seem upset.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.620
Anything you want
to talk about?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.521
I told wayne
to quit looking at me.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.657
He said he's gonna
eat my eyes out.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.526
( sighs )
he's not gonna eat
your eyes out.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.762
Wayne, tell ernesto
you're not gonna eat
his eyes out.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.764
I'm gonna eat
his eyes out.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.735
Oh, wayne,
we know that's
an empty threat.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.571
Last time you attacked a guy,
you only plucked out one eye,

04:32.573 --> 04:34.806
And you couldn't
even finish that.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.875
Why are you
so mad at ernesto?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.845
My baby sister came
to see me the other day

04:39.847 --> 04:43.348
And this unworthy
son of a bitch started
hitting on her.

04:43.350 --> 04:45.517
I see, and how did
that make you feel?

04:45.519 --> 04:48.353
I was angry,
but she was all,

04:48.355 --> 04:49.921
"it's okay, scooter.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.357
<i>Don't hurt him, scooter.</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:55.460
Let him live, scooter."

04:55.462 --> 04:59.898
Scooter?

05:01.969 --> 05:06.371
When I was little,
I beat up a kid and took
his nickname.

05:06.373 --> 05:10.042
And just for the sake
of conversation,

05:10.044 --> 05:11.943
Did you-- does your sister
have a name?

05:11.945 --> 05:14.079
- Wynona.
- ( coughs )

05:15.748 --> 05:18.950
And if I find out any of you
even looked at her,

05:18.952 --> 05:22.854
I'll stab you in the heart
with a fork.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.723
Well, the important thing is

05:24.725 --> 05:27.759
That wayne has a sister that
he cares very much about.

05:27.761 --> 05:31.063
And no one here
has even seen her
or talked to her.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.099
Except ernesto.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.540
- Hey there.
- Hey, buddy.
What's going on?

05:41.542 --> 05:45.344
Well, I finally got
the window fixed
on my car.

05:45.346 --> 05:48.847
At the little cafeteria
downstairs from my office.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.749
Oh, and I'm dating
a serial killer's sister.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.685
What? Oh, my g--
how the hell did
that happen?

05:53.687 --> 05:56.788
I go in there and I order
the same thing every day,
turkey and avocado--

05:56.790 --> 05:58.757
No, no, no,
I mean the serial
killer thing.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.993
I know, I know, I know.
I'm still trying to
figure out what to do.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.429
I met her at the prison,
had no idea who she was,

06:04.431 --> 06:06.732
And now I'm convinced her
brother's gonna kill me.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.900
How's he gonna kill you?
He's locked up.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.135
Of course.
You're right.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.704
Now she's
gonna kill you.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.674
Your girlfriend was spawned
from the same horrific

06:15.676 --> 06:17.576
Genetic pool
that her brother was.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.678
I know, I know,
there's all this
research about

06:19.680 --> 06:21.646
If one sibling has
sociopathic tendencies,

06:21.648 --> 06:23.148
Odds are the other
one will too.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.118
Break up with this girl, man.
Break up with her now.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.489
I'm a black man yelling
at the movie screen
of your life.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.724
Don't go in the basement!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.926
And I'm the white guy
sitting in front of you

06:34.928 --> 06:37.729
Who wants
to say, "be quiet,"
but I'm afraid.

06:39.999 --> 06:43.468
Patrick:
<i>Don't you even feel the least</i>
<i>bit creepy sitting here</i>

06:43.470 --> 06:45.737
<i>Waiting to peek at someone</i>
<i>through their window?</i>

06:45.739 --> 06:47.572
Nolan:
<i>It's not creepy,</i>
<i>it's like we're on a date.</i>

06:47.574 --> 06:51.009
Patrick:
<i>This is all in your head,</i>
<i>nolan.</i>

06:51.011 --> 06:53.879
Nolan:
<i>No, it's not.</i>
<i>Look through your binoculars.</i>

06:55.515 --> 06:59.418
<i>Five, four, three,</i>
<i>two--</i>

06:59.420 --> 07:01.520
<i>See? Told you.</i>

07:01.522 --> 07:03.889
Patrick:
<i>So what? So she opened</i>
<i>up her blinds.</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:06.992
Patrick: <i>So what?</i>
<i>So she opened up her robe.</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:09.594
Nolan:
<i>Keep watching.</i>

07:09.596 --> 07:12.631
Patrick:
<i>Okay, so she's got</i>
<i>a feather duster.</i>

07:12.633 --> 07:14.032
<i>I'll admit that's odd.</i>

07:14.034 --> 07:17.569
Nolan:
<i>Keep watching.</i>

07:17.571 --> 07:21.440
<i>( nolan laughs )</i>

07:21.442 --> 07:24.209
Patrick:
<i>I can't believe she's</i>
<i>doing this on purpose.</i>

07:24.211 --> 07:26.077
<i>I am calling her.</i>

07:28.080 --> 07:30.849
( phone ringing )

07:37.123 --> 07:39.925
Hey, patrick,
I'm in the middle
of a date right now.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.460
Can I call you back?

07:41.462 --> 07:43.995
Patrick:
<i>A date? Anyone I know?</i>

07:43.997 --> 07:47.165
Just some hot guy.
Probably a basketball
player or something.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.935
Patrick: <i>Really?</i>
<i>Where did he take you?</i>

07:49.937 --> 07:52.737
Nowhere,
just a swanky new club.

07:52.739 --> 07:56.174
Patrick:
<i>That's funny, I don't hear</i>
<i>anything in the background.</i>

07:56.176 --> 07:58.910
Oh, well, yeah,
that's because it's this
hot new place

07:58.912 --> 08:01.146
Called... Silence.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.982
No one's allowed to talk.
Everybody's looking at me,
I gotta go.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.954
Nolan:
<i>Well?</i>

08:08.956 --> 08:10.722
Patrick:
<i>Okay, you're right.</i>

08:10.724 --> 08:12.958
<i>But what does it tell you?</i>
<i>That she's embarrassed,</i>

08:12.960 --> 08:15.560
<i>Ashamed, and doesn't want</i>
<i>to admit it's even happening.</i>

08:15.562 --> 08:18.830
Nolan:
<i>That she's in a relationship</i>
<i>with me!</i>

08:27.241 --> 08:32.844
Yeah, I mean,
it's the middle of nowhere.
How did you find it?

08:32.846 --> 08:36.548
Oh, this guy I used to date
when I first moved to la
brought me here.

08:36.550 --> 08:40.018
I love this spot,
but he turned out to be
a real ass clown.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.654
Something you should
know about me.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.891
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been terrified of
ass clowns.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.728
Yeah, I try to avoid
the ass circus altogether.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.834
Oh, damn it,
I hit the trunk latch.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.269
You know what?
Let's just leave it.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.539
Nah, somebody might think
we need help.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.808
And we know
what we're doing,
don't we?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.020
Is everything okay?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.055
Yeah. I'm fine.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.558
Are you sure?

09:19.560 --> 09:22.260
You really shouldn't
keep a bottle of bleach
in the trunk.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.096
It could spill.
But that's probably
why you have

09:25.098 --> 09:29.134
The shower curtain in there--
to protect everything.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.604
Like the roll of duct tape
that's there for apparently
no reason at all.

09:34.340 --> 09:39.010
Also, why do you
have an axe?

09:39.012 --> 09:40.812
Yeah, I really wish you
wouldn't have seen that.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.014
Me too-- I mean, why?

09:43.016 --> 09:45.884
Because I'm a slob.
( nervous laughter )

09:45.886 --> 09:48.153
Yeah, all that stuff
is in there from fixing
up my bathroom,

09:48.155 --> 09:50.722
And the axe is from
last christmas when
I cut down my own tree

09:50.724 --> 09:52.991
And just left it
there like a lazy bones.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.928
And where does one cut down
their own tree in los angeles?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.930
There's fir trees
all around.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.267
I mean, look, over there,
there's one right behind you.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.269
Ah, that's okay,
I believe you.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.207
What's with the private
session, charlie?

10:09.209 --> 10:11.242
Well, wayne, you are making
so much progress

10:11.244 --> 10:13.712
That I thought
we'd try a new exercise.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.116
I'm gonna present some
hypothetical anger triggers

10:18.118 --> 10:19.851
And you're gonna tell me
how you might respond.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.953
It's tough to say,
but I guess I'd

10:21.955 --> 10:25.724
Take a ballpoint pen
and try to punch a hole
in your windpipe.

10:25.726 --> 10:29.194
We haven't started yet.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.663
Oh.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.966
Okay, okay.
First hypothetical--

10:34.968 --> 10:37.669
I noticed that you had
a visceral reaction

10:37.671 --> 10:40.205
To the idea of ernesto
dating your sister.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.775
Is this something you feel
with any guy that tries

10:43.777 --> 10:46.077
To date your sister?

10:46.079 --> 10:48.279
Is this about
you and my sister?

10:48.281 --> 10:51.282
- What?
- Yeah, we talk.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.751
What did she tell you?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.352
Everything.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.422
Oh.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.291
Welcome to the family,
charlie.

11:00.293 --> 11:04.162
I look forward to being
photoshopped in all your
family pictures.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.064
Look at us,
we're practically kinfolk.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.770
Wayne, I'm wondering,
do you and your sister
share any...

11:11.772 --> 11:14.673
Unusual personality traits
that might be viewed as

11:14.675 --> 11:17.442
Outside the social norm?

11:17.444 --> 11:20.245
Well, we both have
perfect pitch.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.048
Hmm.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.316
D-sharp.

11:25.318 --> 11:29.421
Sometimes siblings
share certain traits
like, you know...

11:29.423 --> 11:32.023
Perfect pitch...

11:32.025 --> 11:34.192
Killing people.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.960
I get what
you're saying, charlie.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.929
Don't worry,
she was adopted.

11:37.931 --> 11:42.133
Wow, I gotta be honest,
I'm really relieved.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.302
I started to think that
maybe she was, you know...

11:44.304 --> 11:48.139
- Gonna kill you?
- Yeah, with an axe.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.175
I found one
in the trunk of her car.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.811
Oh, no,
she's back to that?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.179
Back to...?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.081
Cutting down her own
christmas trees.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.382
That's an industry,
charlie.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.384
She should be
buying that from
a reputable ex-con

11:59.386 --> 12:02.353
In a dirt lot
behind a tire store.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.190
So she was using it
for a christmas tree.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.458
Hmm.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.993
D-sharp again.

12:08.995 --> 12:13.732
I'll be up here,
hmm, you meet me
down there, hmm.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.968
( both humming )

12:16.970 --> 12:21.106
Anyway, I've been
ashamed of what happened

12:21.108 --> 12:22.774
My whole life.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.776
Ed, this is a safe place.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.246
I promise,
no matter what you say,
nobody here will judge you,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.982
Because judgment makes us
small, patrick and lacey.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.354
Okay.

12:36.356 --> 12:41.126
I was born different.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.928
When I was 10 years old,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.263
I had to have

12:45.265 --> 12:49.067
One of my nuts removed.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.437
When the kids at school
found out about it,

12:52.439 --> 12:55.006
They threw acorns at me
and yelled,

12:55.008 --> 12:58.276
"here!
We found your nut."

12:58.278 --> 13:01.079
( laughs )

13:03.349 --> 13:06.518
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were done.

13:06.520 --> 13:11.289
Ed, I apologize.
It must be difficult
only having one testicle.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.158
Oh, no, no,
I have two.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.560
Oh. Oh!

13:15.562 --> 13:18.096
( laughs )

13:19.198 --> 13:21.099
I'm gonna stop talking now.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.838
Okay, we'll talk about
the damage that did to you
next time.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.973
See everybody
next Thursday.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.878
Oh, hey, nolan,
I'm gonna go to the
merry peasant tomorrow night.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.415
Do you want to join me?
I bet that waitress who likes
you will be there.

13:37.417 --> 13:42.921
Does anyone know when
this heat wave is gonna end?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.924
I heard it's gonna be even
hotter tomorrow night.

13:45.926 --> 13:50.128
I think I'm gonna
have to start sleeping
in a wet t-shirt.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.431
Sorry, I can't
make it tomorrow.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.202
Family emergency.
My aunt is...

13:57.204 --> 14:00.572
Fine.
It was totally
unexpected.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.476
You are despicable.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.945
What?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.880
I was with nolan
last night.

14:08.882 --> 14:13.451
Everything.
I am trying to get him
a social life,

14:13.453 --> 14:15.887
And you're keeping him from
having a real relationship.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.422
If you cared
about him at all,

14:17.424 --> 14:20.959
You will stop jerking him
around... Or start.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.027
Oh, come on,
it's no big deal.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.630
Like you've never danced
in a window for a guy.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.899
This is not about me.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.371
How about I get us
a couple of beers?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.306
That sounds great.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.307
So, wait a minute,
wait a minute--

14:36.309 --> 14:39.110
Where did you
learn all that?

14:39.112 --> 14:42.280
After high school,
all the girls in the graduating
class went to France,

14:42.282 --> 14:44.215
And I stayed home
and banged their boyfriends.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.619
Cool.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.658
Can I borrow your robe?

14:53.660 --> 14:56.394
Gonna take a shower.
I left all my clothes
downstairs.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.129
Wynona:
Oh, yeah,
no problem.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.205
Huh.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.907
( shouts )

15:12.011 --> 15:13.578
Uh, what happened?

15:13.580 --> 15:17.348
Oh, nothing.
It's just a noise I make
when I'm really happy.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.617
( mock shouts )

15:19.619 --> 15:21.586
You looked in the closet,
didn't you?

15:21.588 --> 15:25.023
Animal skulls?
Who said anything
about animal skulls?

15:25.025 --> 15:28.693
Charlie, they're just
roadkill heads.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.962
J-j-just
roadkill heads?

15:30.964 --> 15:33.331
Yeah.
It's a hobby of mine.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.967
Ah.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.169
Yeah, if I see little animals
on the side of the road,

15:38.171 --> 15:42.540
I skin them and boil them
and display their heads.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.410
Oh, good, good,
I was afraid it might
be something weird.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.581
Wow, you're really
freaked out, aren't you?

15:50.583 --> 15:54.352
Oh, it's because
my brother's a serial killer.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.454
That shouldn't matter
because he's not even
your real brother.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.056
You were adopted, right?

15:58.058 --> 16:01.359
Kinda. I was adopted
away from the family.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.294
I'm sorry, what?

16:03.296 --> 16:07.165
Oh, yeah, apparently,
I was a handful.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.734
Mom and dad were always
worried about wayne's safety.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.402
So they sent me away.
( chuckles )

16:13.572 --> 16:15.273
Wayne, when you told me
she was adopted,

16:15.275 --> 16:16.741
You made me
think she wasn't
your real sister.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.078
Charlie, my family crest
features a trans am,

16:20.080 --> 16:24.215
A broken lawn mower,
and a dead guy looking
for his trans am.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.320
We are not
the vanderbilts.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.622
You cannot trick me
into liking her.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.391
I'm sorry about that.

16:33.393 --> 16:37.762
And I want her to have
a chance at a relationship
with a nice guy.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.599
Yeah, but she's crazy.
She has a necklace made
of kitten teeth.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.469
I've seen 'em.
They go with everything.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.037
You know what,
I'm sorry.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.573
I can't do this.
I have to break up
with her.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.643
I'm just scared
that she's gonna put
my boiled head on a shelf.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.512
You got any ideas?

16:54.514 --> 16:57.115
I don't know.
She tends to react

16:57.117 --> 16:59.150
Pretty badly when a fella
breaks up with her.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.518
Then why don't you
take the heat off of me?

17:00.520 --> 17:06.157
She does look up to me as kind
of a urbane man of the world.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.493
I've been to six different
county lock-ups,

17:08.495 --> 17:12.163
Numerous small-town pokyes,
and a mexican prison...

17:12.165 --> 17:15.333
That might've just been
a really dirty motel.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.271
Nolan:
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>She's 15 minutes late.</i>

17:20.273 --> 17:22.440
<i>She's never</i>
<i>been late before.</i>

17:22.442 --> 17:25.309
Patrick:
<i>Maybe she finally realized</i>

17:25.311 --> 17:27.178
<i>That she's been</i>
<i>holding you back.</i>

17:27.180 --> 17:30.782
<i>Now come on,</i>
<i>let's go to the bar.</i>
<i>Daley will be there.</i>

17:30.784 --> 17:33.484
Nolan:
<i>What if she needs help?</i>
<i>Maybe she's hurt.</i>

17:33.486 --> 17:36.187
<i>Maybe when she went</i>
<i>to open up the blinds,</i>

17:36.189 --> 17:38.056
<i>She got distracted</i>
<i>by her shadow,</i>

17:38.058 --> 17:39.657
<i>Accidently wrapped</i>
<i>the cord around her neck,</i>

17:39.659 --> 17:41.793
<i>And almost hung herself.</i>

17:41.795 --> 17:44.395
Patrick:
<i>That happened to you,</i>
<i>didn't it?</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:46.531
Nolan:
<i>Maybe when I was a kid...</i>

17:46.533 --> 17:48.733
<i>And last week.</i>

17:48.735 --> 17:51.769
Patrick:
<i>Nolan, you can do better.</i>

17:51.771 --> 17:55.073
<i>This is a very low bar.</i>

17:56.608 --> 17:59.277
<i>Let's go.</i>

17:59.279 --> 18:01.379
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

18:04.817 --> 18:06.684
( gasps )
oh, no.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.805
It's not just that
she had all these creepy
little rodent skulls,

18:27.807 --> 18:30.541
It was that she
named them after
famous killers.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.176
Two of my favorites being

18:32.178 --> 18:36.314
Lizard borden and
james squirrel ray.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.882
So what'd you do?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.851
Did you grow a pair
and break up with her?

18:39.853 --> 18:41.652
No, no, no.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.355
I asked wayne to
talk to her for me.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.823
Interesting choice.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.126
When it comes
to affairs of the heart,

18:48.128 --> 18:51.896
No one can match the delicate
touch of a serial killer.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.266
- Charlie!
- Wynona!

18:57.503 --> 18:58.736
How's it going?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.606
Not good.
Who's your friend?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.408
Detective mike bowman,
lapd,

19:04.410 --> 19:06.777
And my mom knows I'm here.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.747
Look, charlie,
I just finished talking
to my brother

19:09.749 --> 19:11.883
And he said he's going to
have us both killed if we
keep seeing each other.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.818
Oh, my god, no,
that's terrible.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.320
Well, he does have
friends on the outside,
so we have no choice

19:16.322 --> 19:17.855
But to never see
each other again.
Take care.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.757
No, no, no,
don't be afraid of wayne.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.227
I mean, you're his therapist,
you can change his mind.

19:23.229 --> 19:26.631
This is really hard
for me to admit, but...

19:26.633 --> 19:29.734
I am a terrible therapist.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.771
It's true.
He's worthless.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.575
I've known him for a long time,
I've seen his work.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.578
There's lab rats with more
insight into human psychology.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.280
So there's
nothing you can do?

19:42.282 --> 19:46.784
From banging his head
into a brick wall out
of frustration.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.788
Thank you, detective,
she gets it.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.559
I'm sorry,
wynona,

19:54.561 --> 19:58.529
I wish there
was another way,
but there's not.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.465
I don't want to risk
your safety, so...

20:01.467 --> 20:04.202
You should go.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.537
I'm sorry.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.674
I have to walk
away now.

20:09.676 --> 20:13.511
( whispers )
mostly because all I have
is a little blue spatula.

20:17.416 --> 20:21.919
It doesn't matter now.
Nothing matters now.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.830
I want you to have this.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.233
His name is ted bunny.

20:35.235 --> 20:39.637
Oh, like ted bundy.
That's cute.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.475
Good-bye, charlie.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.278
Good-bye, wynona.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.547
Whenever I'm traveling
down the highway

20:49.549 --> 20:52.817
And I see
some roadkill,

20:52.819 --> 20:54.752
I'll think of you.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.523
( sobbing )

21:03.795 --> 21:05.563
A spatula?

21:07.432 --> 21:08.966
( creepy voice )
yes...

21:08.968 --> 21:11.736
A spatula.
