00:56.189 --> 00:57.590
No, it isn't!

01:00.960 --> 01:02.796
He's got to be
in here somewhere.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.763
He's just a kid!
What does he want with a...

01:04.831 --> 01:06.032
What's it called?

01:06.099 --> 01:07.400
A matter compressor.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.335
Well... Maybe he wants
some matter compressed?

01:09.402 --> 01:11.905
Whatever his reason,

02:03.189 --> 02:04.891
Don't worry about us,
where did it go?

02:12.866 --> 02:16.736
If Slitheen are back on Earth
it means mayhem
on a global scale.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.538
What do they want this time?

02:18.605 --> 02:20.907
Well, Same as usual,
I imagine, convert our planet
into cash.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
Then how do we find it?

02:22.041 --> 02:23.376
We'd need a bloodhound.

As you can see,

07:18.671 --> 07:23.543
we do not disguise
ourselves in human skin
like Slitheen.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.346
Or we could never
kill a human.

what colour they are,
they're from the same planet.

something more meaty.

Shut up, Clyde.

Clom, Clix and

12:19.572 --> 12:22.141
LEEF: His concern
is understandable.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.911
Though this is something
that will truly delight you.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.547
It's lovely, thank you.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.616
It's a staple food back home.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.017
It can grow anywhere,

12:32.084 --> 12:35.020
even in
the harshest conditions.

from famines on Earth.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.070
Rakweed could put
an end to them forever.

12:51.137 --> 12:55.741
LEEF: Of course, if it came
directly from outsiders
such as ourselves,

12:55.808 --> 12:58.277
your people
would be distrustful.

12:58.344 --> 13:02.548
That is why we want you,
Sarah Jane, to be our...

We do what we do
to help the world.

13:23.702 --> 13:24.904
Main course.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.039
Excuse me.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.541
Could you just give me a hand?

13:32.645 --> 13:33.946
Is this all
too good to be true,

13:34.013 --> 13:35.614
or have I become
totally paranoid?

13:35.681 --> 13:37.917
You taught us
to keep an open mind.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.420
Well, I've had
bad experiences,
with aliens bearing gifts.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.989
Mr Smith will know
if it's dangerous.

13:44.056 --> 13:47.893
Plus, you can't pass up
a chance to feed the entire
human race, can you?

13:47.960 --> 13:50.162
Do you really think
we can trust the Blathereen?

13:57.970 --> 14:00.339
I think so.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.042
Plus, if they wanted us dead
they'd have done it by now.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.277
Not necessarily.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.213
Oh, I just don't know.

14:07.279 --> 14:09.715
Go with your instincts.
They're always right.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.884
In this case my instincts
are all over the place.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.921
Ta-da! Shepherd's pie.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.225
I made that.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.261
Shepherds are a delicacy
on Earth?

14:22.328 --> 14:25.197
Yeah, but you couldn't
eat a whole one.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.899
It's just the name
of the dish.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.449

14:46.552 --> 14:49.321

LEEF: It's our chance
to finally put things right.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.996
And it could mean
a new friendship
between our races.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.065
You realise, I'll have
to analyse the Rakweed,

15:00.766 --> 15:02.067
make sure it's safe.

15:02.134 --> 15:05.070
LEEF: Of course.
Do that straight away.

15:06.171 --> 15:09.141
But thank you.
In principle, I...

15:10.142 --> 15:11.010
We...

Earth accepts.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.595
I'll never forget you,
or what you've given us.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.899
Will you accept the claw

MR SMITH: <i>How may I</i>

16:21.947 --> 16:23.315
I need you

16:23.382 --> 16:25.551
RANI: Such an
amazing opportunity.

16:25.617 --> 16:28.354
Yeah, or it could all
be a trap.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.022
RANI: They're Blathereen
not Slitheen.

16:30.089 --> 16:33.225
CLYDE: Ah, Slitheen,
Blathereen, Whatevereen.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.861
They're from
Raxacorico-doo-dar.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.963
And that place has
a seriously dodgy reputation.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.333
You can't condemn
an entire race just cause
a few of them are bad.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.235
-There are bad people
on Earth, too.
-Rani's right.

16:43.302 --> 16:46.605
-And we're here to help
aliens, not just fight them.
-Exactly.

16:47.373 --> 16:48.107
Sarah Jane?

16:49.375 --> 16:50.609
This is huge.

16:52.311 --> 16:56.615
If I make this public,
it'll change everything.

No more hiding in the shadows,

How do I explain him

25:31.296 --> 25:33.398
What's this?

25:33.465 --> 25:36.801
<i>He has been subjected</i>
<i>to an incredibly high dose</i>
<i>of Rakweed spores.</i>

25:37.969 --> 25:40.572
Luke, Luke,
you must stay awake.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.348
TEACHER: Put your
text books away...

25:50.415 --> 25:51.983
Sarah Jane will hit the roof!

25:52.050 --> 25:53.818
Sarah Jane isn't
gonna find out.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.820
What if someone hears him?
He makes a right racket.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.124
Ah, I borrowed this too.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.826
Relays his voice
straight into my ear.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.195
Using K9 to pass a test,

26:04.262 --> 26:07.399
even by your standards
this is a new level of stupid.

26:07.465 --> 26:09.601
We may not be
allowed textbooks,

26:09.668 --> 26:13.271
but no one said anything about
a super-intelligent robot dog
from the year 5000.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.406
You're insane.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.943
Yep, an insane genius.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.477
I hope you two
are paying attention.

26:19.544 --> 26:20.879
Of course, Miss, raring to go.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.089
(WHIRRING)

26:44.569 --> 26:46.137
This is all my fault.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.542
(SCREECHING)

26:50.608 --> 26:52.410
Mum! Look!

26:54.045 --> 26:55.613
Mr Smith! I need you!

26:57.282 --> 26:58.950
Mr Smith! Please! Help us!

27:06.124 --> 27:08.259
MR SMITH:
<i>At its current rate</i>
<i>of propagation,</i>

27:08.326 --> 27:11.529
<i>the Rakweed will have seeded</i>
<i>the whole of London</i>
<i>within a few hours.</i>

27:13.431 --> 27:15.600
Is that... Rakweed?

27:15.667 --> 27:18.837
Ah! We've got to stop this,
come on.

27:18.903 --> 27:21.973
The Rakweed, it got you
didn't it, are you okay?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.908
I'm Blathareened.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.113
RANI: <i>Luke?</i>

27:28.179 --> 27:29.948
So how far has this spread,
just the school grounds?
Or further?

27:33.351 --> 27:34.386
It's everywhere.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.955
Let the hunt begin!
