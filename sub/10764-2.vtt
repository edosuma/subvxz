01:54.080 --> 01:58.449
Today, sir, I thought
we might begin the day with an aspirin...

01:59.152 --> 02:02.121
preventative medicine
being so much the mode.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.817
It's too late, Geoffrey.
I already have a headache...

02:05.892 --> 02:08.725
just anticipating that infernal hammering
at the office.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.821
I thought the workmen
were supposed be done by yesterday.

02:11.898 --> 02:15.163
Shockingly enough, Vivian,
they're behind schedule.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.897
Dad, it's so obvious.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.702
If all that hammering is bothering you,
just tell them to quit it.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.504
I don't even want to talk about it.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.978
These are the only moments
of peace and quiet I'll have all day.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.525
Another aspirin, sir?

02:44.197 --> 02:45.789
Perhaps a gun.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.760
What the devil is he doing up there?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.828
<i>I Got The Power by Snap.</i>

02:55.942 --> 02:57.842
Snap is a great band.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.779
When Crackle and Pop cut a disc,
then call me.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.121
- What's so funny?
- Carlton told a joke.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.682
No, Hilary. Carlton is a joke.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.089
Mommy, who's gonna take me
to my tennis lesson after school today?

03:19.165 --> 03:22.760
Are you sure it's tennis today?
Maybe you'd better check your schedule.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.097
Schedule?

03:24.170 --> 03:27.606
My parents bought me this calendar
so I could keep my lessons straight.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.302
Didn't you have a schedule
for after school at my age?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.241
<i>Yeah, the TV Guide.</i>

03:34.113 --> 03:38.516
See, Monday is for ballet,
Tuesday is riding, Wednesday is violin.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.784
I thought today was violin, sweetie pie.

03:42.855 --> 03:47.554
You mean Ashley would have shown up
for her violin lesson in her tennis outfit?

03:51.864 --> 03:53.923
I just pictured it.

03:58.137 --> 04:01.834
I'm two for two.
I'm going to quit while I'm ahead.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.667
May I suggest retirement?

04:07.447 --> 04:09.244
Keep them coming, Will.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.284
So, Mommy, who's going to drive me?

04:14.387 --> 04:18.880
There's a growing pollution problem
in this city, and I will not contribute to it.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.358
I absolutely refuse
to drive anybody anywhere...

04:21.427 --> 04:23.725
until a responsible car pool is organized.

04:23.796 --> 04:26.390
But, Hilary, Ashley is in a car pool.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.801
I just don't want to do it, okay?

04:30.803 --> 04:32.430
I have an idea.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.804
Will, you don't have any chores
this afternoon. You can drive Ashley.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.366
Word up. Kick over the keys to the Jag.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.043
- The Benzito?
- The station wagon.

04:44.517 --> 04:46.542
Come on, you're gonna ruin my rep.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.417
You're only 17. You don't have a rep yet.

04:53.226 --> 04:56.753
You'll drive her to her class,
wait for her there, and bring her home.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.992
Come on, I got to sit through
a hour of them scratchy violins?

05:00.066 --> 05:01.966
You might learn something.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.970
The same thing I learned
from banging my head against a pole:

05:05.038 --> 05:06.665
Don't do it again.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.605
This is your new job.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.906
Wednesdays you are Ashley's driver.
Understood?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.070
Yes'm.

05:14.247 --> 05:18.707
I'll be more than happy to drive you
to the Piggly Wiggly, Miss Daisy.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.078
I'm sorry.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.343
Ladies, hold it. Wait a minute.

05:51.417 --> 05:55.751
Let's try something different.
Everybody just repeat after me, okay?

06:25.485 --> 06:28.420
Come, girls! You are late.

06:31.057 --> 06:35.619
Now let's begin with the piece
you were to memorize...

06:35.695 --> 06:39.597
<i>from Stravinsky's
Violin Concerto in D minor.</i>

06:39.999 --> 06:42.297
And remember, you are playing this...

06:42.368 --> 06:45.496
for a woman
who was the great Stravinsky's lover.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.903
One, two, three, four.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.607
Faster!

06:52.879 --> 06:54.403
Stop!

06:54.647 --> 06:56.774
You, there. What you do here?

06:59.051 --> 07:02.418
I'm Ashley's cousin.
I was just waiting to drive her home.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.085
You make me kind of nervous
with that stick, lady.

07:06.192 --> 07:09.821
You dare to read
while great Stravinsky is played?

07:10.530 --> 07:13.021
I wasn't as tight with the man
as you were.

07:13.399 --> 07:18.029
Do not attempt to make joke with me.
I was lover of both Laurel and Hardy.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.205
Guess that look really works for you then.

07:32.151 --> 07:35.712
Hey, Ash, that was decent
to listen to that kind of music...

07:35.788 --> 07:39.053
without having to see
Freddy Krueger kill somebody.

07:40.193 --> 07:43.492
- I'm glad somebody enjoys it.
- What, don't you?

07:43.696 --> 07:47.359
Not yet, but when I'm older,
it will be very useful to me.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.659
No, wait. That's tennis.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.865
- Who told you that?
- My dad.

07:52.939 --> 07:56.500
Just because your dad likes something,
doesn't mean you have to like it.

07:56.576 --> 07:59.238
He likes being a lawyer.
You don't have to be a lawyer.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.405
I am going to be a lawyer.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.848
Ash, the world does not need
another Philip Banks.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.851
We might not have enough farmland
to support the one we have.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.616
No, the world needs an Ashley Banks.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.090
Girls, you must remember
to practice more, no?

08:16.496 --> 08:21.024
Violin is very jealous,
much like the sexy Toscanini.

08:21.400 --> 08:26.099
If you even look at another,
it will not speak to you for days.

08:26.205 --> 08:30.471
But if you give all of yourselves,
it will fulfill your every need...

08:30.543 --> 08:33.102
and set your very soul on fire.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.042
What does she mean by that?

08:37.116 --> 08:41.746
Let's just say that lady expects a lot
from a piece of wood and some strings.

08:58.137 --> 09:01.129
- Your aspirin, sir.
- Thank you, Geoffrey.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.442
Do you attribute your headaches, sir...

09:04.510 --> 09:07.104
solely to the ongoing construction
in your office...

09:07.179 --> 09:11.013
or do you suppose there might be
a stress factor involved?

09:13.319 --> 09:16.152
This is how my day went, Geoffrey.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.554
At 9:00, they were pounding.

09:18.624 --> 09:21.286
At 10:00, they were jackhammering.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.591
By noon, a pneumatic drill came into play.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.031
And, Geoffrey,
they were just repainting the office.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.194
I'd say that's cause for stress.
Wouldn't you?

09:34.707 --> 09:37.175
You know, sir, the Earl of Cranbrook...

09:37.243 --> 09:39.677
to whom I was in service
for several years...

09:39.745 --> 09:42.373
suffered from the most severe headaches.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.315
And you're saying these were caused
by some sort of stress?

09:45.384 --> 09:47.545
I should very much doubt it.

09:47.753 --> 09:51.245
He spent his days riding to the hounds,
and his evenings...

09:51.324 --> 09:55.988
attending rather pleasant dinner parties
with his delightful wife, Lady Celia.

09:59.131 --> 10:03.261
Now, she was a terribly good
snooker player, one of the best.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.998
- One night, she bet...
- Geoffrey.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.837
Where does the stress come in?

10:09.909 --> 10:12.537
It certainly doesn't
in Lord Cranbrook's case.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.910
I never saw a calmer household.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.775
Then what was the point of the story?

10:18.084 --> 10:20.575
Sheer entertainment, sir.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.389
What the devil was that?

10:27.460 --> 10:31.487
I believe the technical term
is a "rim shot."

10:34.667 --> 10:36.134
Who did it?

10:36.402 --> 10:40.338
Utter speculation, of course,
but my guess is Master William.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.266
Ashley, honey...

11:16.008 --> 11:17.976
where is your violin?

11:18.044 --> 11:20.911
- Big Sal has it.
- Big Sal?

11:20.980 --> 11:23.949
He owns this great store
where you don't need any money.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.144
You just go in and give him something
you don't even want anymore...

11:27.219 --> 11:30.484
- and he gives you this ticket. Then...
- A pawnshop?

11:32.191 --> 11:36.651
- You took her to a pawnshop?
- Yeah, it was really hard, too.

11:36.729 --> 11:40.062
You don't have many pawnshops
in Bel-Air. That's really a shame.

11:40.132 --> 11:44.364
- I had to go all the way to East LA.
- East LA?

11:47.039 --> 11:51.066
- They gave me a great deal.
- They gave you a set of drums.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.167
And...

11:54.346 --> 11:57.577
I made them throw in a little gift
for each of you. Close your eyes.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.811
- Vivian!
- I want my present.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.321
Okay, open.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.325
What a lovely antique necklace.

12:14.266 --> 12:17.793
- What is this?
- Daddy, it's a diamond.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.604
No, it isn't.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.731
- You don't like it?
- No, I do not.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.733
Can I have it?

12:28.547 --> 12:31.072
How dare you pawn her violin!

12:31.150 --> 12:34.881
- She don't even like playing it no more.
- She will learn to like it later.

12:34.954 --> 12:38.515
A young woman who can play a violin
is an accomplished young lady.

12:38.591 --> 12:42.220
A girlie that can play the drums
can write her own ticket.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.321
Will, I want the best for Ashley.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.670
When I was a kid, I loved classical music,
but my parents couldn't afford lessons.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.536
I used to stand out in the parking lot
of the Philharmonic...

12:55.608 --> 12:58.406
hoping to catch a spare note
on the night air.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.708
Philip, when I met you,
you were into James Brown.

13:03.415 --> 13:06.873
- He liked James Brown?
- He even wore his hair like him.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.577
He had hair?

13:15.494 --> 13:19.396
You know, it is possible to like
both classical music and James Brown.

13:19.465 --> 13:23.424
I could not agree more. So let's
let Ashley play whatever she wants.

13:23.502 --> 13:25.561
She spent an entire year on the violin.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.573
So if she wants to try something new,
let her.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.541
You tell him, Aunt Viv.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.271
- And as for you, young man...
- Love you.

13:42.955 --> 13:46.721
The next time
you decide to visit a pawnshop, don't.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.320
- Are we clear on that?
- Yes.

13:51.730 --> 13:55.461
Master William,
there is a young gentleman downstairs...

13:55.534 --> 13:59.197
with a rather large radio
who is here to see you.

13:59.271 --> 14:03.037
- He claims his name is Jazz.
- Yo, word up. Send him up.

14:03.175 --> 14:07.202
- Now, who is this Jazz fellow?
- I heard the boy at a club.

14:07.279 --> 14:10.146
He was all of that.
He will be Ashley's new music teacher.

14:10.216 --> 14:14.516
I mean, he's not as experienced
as Madame Chatchka, but then who is?

14:17.089 --> 14:18.750
Mr. Jazz.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.164
It's nice to meet you, Jazz.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.530
How do you do? I'm Mr. Banks.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.367
You got that right.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.564
Man, you're loaded!

14:38.244 --> 14:39.871
Yo, what's up, J.?

14:43.148 --> 14:45.082
Come on, let's just leave them alone.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.642
- I asked him to take her to her lesson...
- I know, baby.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.255
Tell Mama all about it.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.621
Ash, how about let Jazz get busy
one time?

15:36.769 --> 15:40.535
So, Carlton, how's the soccer scene?

15:41.106 --> 15:44.701
Well, I may be moving up
from JV to Varsity, but...

15:46.178 --> 15:50.444
Am I the only one who finds
this drumming inappropriate for high tea?

15:55.220 --> 15:58.781
I can't take another week of this.
From morning until night...

15:58.857 --> 16:02.384
all I hear is this relentless, pulsating,
thumping beat.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.393
- I'm going to the Hard Rock Cafe.
- Hilary.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.095
Stay.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.432
We are having tea.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.575
It's a civilized way for me
to have a conversation with my family...

16:21.647 --> 16:23.274
so someone talk.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.452
I want her severely punished!

16:31.890 --> 16:34.916
It was the only time
that Jazz could give her a lesson today.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.088
- I wish you would stop calling him that.
- But that's his name.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.097
It is not. It can't be.

16:42.968 --> 16:46.404
These kids like to make up
their own names. Let them.

16:46.605 --> 16:48.835
Okay, fine.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.506
From now on, I'm no longer Philip Banks.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.738
Just call me King Edward IV.

16:55.781 --> 16:58.249
As you wish, Your Majesty.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.219
Humor, sir.

17:05.723 --> 17:08.557
Dad, I'm as liberal as the next guy...

17:09.228 --> 17:12.220
but it's time for someone to take the reins.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.857
High tea has been a weekly tradition
in our family...

17:14.933 --> 17:16.695
for as long as I can remember.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.227
If we let young Will ruin this for us,
what's next to go?

17:20.305 --> 17:21.704
Christmas?

17:24.675 --> 17:28.772
I can't answer that question for you, son.
Ask your mother.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.609
Come on, you two.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.414
High tea is not a sacred institution.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.590
It's not the tea. It's not the drums.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.127
It's Ashley.

17:45.197 --> 17:48.257
I've spent nine years
trying to raise a proper young lady...

17:48.333 --> 17:51.200
and Will is undoing all of my work
in a week.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.364
- Ashley, honey, come down here!
- What are you doing?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.169
He's punishing her.

17:57.676 --> 18:01.339
No, Hilary, I just want her
to spend some time with her family.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.812
Same thing.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.952
What is all this yelling about downstairs?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.148
Look, we are trying to give
a music lesson upstairs.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.418
Work with me, people, please?

18:14.726 --> 18:16.819
You've been practicing all afternoon.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.659
Look, that is the only way
she's gonna become a star.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.996
This young lady has the drive,
the good look, and the intelligence...

18:23.068 --> 18:24.194
to get to the top...

18:24.269 --> 18:28.069
<i>but she will not be on Yo! MTVRaps
if you all don't work with me.</i>

18:29.842 --> 18:33.334
Practice is over, Will.
Ashley, honey, it's teatime.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.240
Tea.

18:36.915 --> 18:38.246
Biscuits!

18:40.486 --> 18:43.751
Geoffrey, put on
our teatime music, please.

18:44.656 --> 18:48.023
<i>You'll love this, honey.
It's Brandenburg Concertos.</i>

19:02.207 --> 19:04.675
Jazz, hit me with some sugar, man.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.946
- How about a little milk?
- No, I'll get it.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.747
I thought this was sterling.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.347
It's got that certain weight to it.

19:23.195 --> 19:26.596
Yes. This is my favorite part.

19:27.132 --> 19:31.034
Ashley, honey, this is possibly
the most beautiful music ever written.

19:32.771 --> 19:37.071
- Would someone turn it up for me, please?
- Jazz, crank it up for me.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.909
Yes. Listen, darling.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.720
Listen to the violins. Beautiful.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.222
The oboes will be coming next.

20:13.445 --> 20:16.744
Geoffrey, would you tell Miss Ashley
I'd like to speak to her?

20:16.815 --> 20:18.373
Right away, sir.

20:18.917 --> 20:22.182
Now, I know you're upset,
but I want you to stay calm.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.581
I'm calm. I'm happy.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.049
I'm in control.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.851
You see, Vivian, I had lost control.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.198
"Lost control"?

20:34.266 --> 20:37.599
You drop-kicked a human being
across our front lawn.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.570
It felt good, damn it.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.505
I'm back in the saddle again.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.843
You know, I think living down the street
from the Reagans...

20:50.916 --> 20:53.316
has had a very bad effect on you.

20:55.654 --> 20:58.122
Will, your uncle
just wanted to speak with Ashley.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.091
No, let him stay.
I want him to hear this, too.

21:01.159 --> 21:04.720
I hope this isn't going to be
one of those Theo moments.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.624
Ashley, honey, sit down.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.266
Ashley, baby...

21:15.007 --> 21:16.975
through no fault of your own...

21:17.042 --> 21:20.136
things went down
a very wrong path this week.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.013
But luckily,
your daddy has put it all back together.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.049
You're going to return to the violin.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.646
I've called Madame Chatchka.
She's agreed to give you a makeup lesson.

21:30.722 --> 21:34.283
You must have caught her
on one of her rare free nights.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.659
Will, please?

21:37.162 --> 21:39.926
We've all lost sight
of the most important thing here...

21:39.998 --> 21:41.829
and that is what is best for Ashley.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.869
It's not what's best for Ashley.
You're trying to control her.

21:44.936 --> 21:47.200
She's 9 years old,
and she's got a calendar...

21:47.272 --> 21:49.763
telling her where she's got to be,
what she's gotta do.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.207
She doesn't have to worry
about that anymore...

21:52.277 --> 21:55.178
because now you tell her
what to do, right?

21:55.447 --> 21:58.905
There's only one thing wrong with that:
You're not her father.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.646
How come you didn't know
she doesn't like the violin?

22:01.720 --> 22:04.985
She liked it for a year before
you moved in. Can you explain that?

22:05.057 --> 22:08.026
- I never liked it, Daddy.
- That explains it.

22:10.529 --> 22:14.329
Look, if you ask her, she'll tell you
she wants to play the drums.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.560
I don't like the drums, either.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.830
See? Now you confused her.

22:22.374 --> 22:26.572
I'm not confused.
I just didn't want to disappoint you, Will.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.413
And I didn't want
to disappoint you, Daddy.

22:29.481 --> 22:32.746
Now hold on. Let's get this straight.

22:32.818 --> 22:37.118
Ashley, you don't have to please Will,
and you don't have to please your father.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.317
You just continue with the lessons
that you like best.

22:40.392 --> 22:44.021
- Do you mean it, Mommy?
- Absolutely, sweetheart.

22:44.096 --> 22:47.532
- Then I want to quit ballet.
- Ballet? Honey, no.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.101
But you look so cute in that little tutu.

22:52.170 --> 22:56.368
- I really hate it, Mommy.
- But, honey, just until Christmas?

23:03.348 --> 23:04.713
Do you believe that?

23:04.783 --> 23:06.842
- She wants to quit everything.
- I know.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.409
These kids today have no attention span.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.285
I blame television.

23:12.305 --> 23:18.471
