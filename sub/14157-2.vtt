READ MY MIND.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.289
>> * I CAN'T GIVE MY SOUL

07:02.289 --> 07:04.758
>> * I'M IN LOVE WITH MUSIC

07:04.758 --> 07:07.160
* I'M IN LOVE

07:07.160 --> 07:08.328
>> OH, GOD.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.162
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS.

07:09.162 --> 07:09.830
>> WHAT?

07:09.830 --> 07:10.898
MAKE OUT WITH A GUY?

07:10.898 --> 07:15.503
ME NEITHER.

07:15.503 --> 07:18.238
>> OH, GOD.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.072
NO, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.073
I GOT TO GO. I GOT TO GO.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.075
I'M STARTING A NEW JOB TOMORROW.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.578
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.213
LET ME INSIDE

07:26.213 --> 07:29.416
SO I CAN GIVE YOU A PRESENT.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.250
>> NO.

07:30.250 --> 07:30.918
NO, NO.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.585
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.252
I GOT TO GO.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.253
I GOT TO GT UP EARLY.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.021
I GOT TO GO.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.022
>> OKAY.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.524
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

07:36.524 --> 07:37.525
YOU STRIKE ME

07:37.525 --> 07:39.292
AS AN INDIVIDUAL

07:39.292 --> 07:41.629
THAT CAN USE...

07:41.629 --> 07:47.067
A LITTLE CELEBRATION.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.569
>> OKAY.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.738
10 MINUTES.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.239
>> 20.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.240
>> 15.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.241
>> DEAL.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.276
ALL I NEEDED WAS 5.

08:00.848 --> 08:04.618
>> * IT'S A BRAND-NEW DAY

08:04.618 --> 08:06.119
>> SO...

08:06.119 --> 08:07.454
HOW'D IT GO?

08:07.454 --> 08:08.455
DID YOU TOTALLY OWN IT?

08:08.455 --> 08:09.890
>> ALWAYS.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.058
BUT RAISING MY LINE OF CREDIT IS

08:11.058 --> 08:12.059
GOING TO BE A LITTLE TRICKY

08:12.059 --> 08:13.727
RIGHT NOW.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.062
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.030
EVERY "NO" IS ONE STEP CLOSER

08:17.030 --> 08:21.569
TO A "YES."

08:21.569 --> 08:22.770
SO WHERE DID YOU DISAPPEAR

08:22.770 --> 08:24.437
TO LAST NIGHT?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.940
>> OH, YEAH, SORRY.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.008
KEISHA COULDN'T MAKE IT,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.176
AND I JUST FIGURED I'D LET YOU

08:42.756 --> 08:44.091
LIKE, I BARELY GOT THIS JOB.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.258
IF I SNUB THE WRONG PERSON,

08:45.258 --> 08:46.093
IT'LL BE OVER BEFORE

08:46.093 --> 08:47.394

09:33.106 --> 09:34.474
HE WOULD ALWAYS MAKE TIME

09:34.474 --> 09:37.410
TO CHECK ON ME.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.979
HE WAS SO CUTE.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.180

HE WANTED TO GO PUBLIC

09:50.057 --> 09:52.059
WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.327
BUT I WAS BUILDING MY CAREER.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.328
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

09:55.328 --> 09:56.697
THE BACKLASH.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.732
I KNEW PEOPLE WOULD DOUBT US.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.107
TO THE CARIBBEAN ON A WHIM.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.109
BEFORE I KNEW IT, WE WERE

10:09.109 --> 10:11.078
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE JUSTICE

10:11.078 --> 10:12.079
OF THE PEACE, AND HE SLIPPED

10:12.079 --> 10:14.047
THIS ON MY FINGER.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.448
>> "HE SLIPPED THIS ON MY"...

SHE DID.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.263
IT WAS ONLY FOR TWO WEEKS.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.199
TWO WEEKS.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.200
THAT DOESN'T ENTITLE YOU

10:33.200 --> 10:35.568
TO ANYTHING.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.204
>> UNLESS YOUR FATHER INTENDED

10:37.204 --> 10:39.372
TO LEAVE MY CLIENT

10:39.372 --> 10:40.207
PART OF HIS ESTATE.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.709

>> YOU EXPECT ANYONE

10:52.485 --> 10:53.220
TO BELIEVE THAT?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.221
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER, KEISHA,

10:54.221 --> 10:55.055
BECAUSE SHE ISN'T GETTING

10:55.055 --> 10:56.289
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT SAFE.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.124
>> ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT

10:57.124 --> 10:57.958
YOUR CALL.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.793
>> HE'S RIGHT, MALCOLM.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.028
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE

11:55.582 --> 11:56.583
HARDLY.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.551
LOOK, KEISHA, THE MAN IS

11:58.551 --> 12:01.088
THE MOST CORRUPT, SHADY--

12:01.088 --> 12:02.422
>> SHADY?

12:02.422 --> 12:03.390
YOU MEAN LIKE THE TIME

12:03.390 --> 12:04.157
YOU CHEATED ON ME

12:04.157 --> 12:04.925
AND FATHERED A CHILD

12:04.925 --> 12:09.596
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN TYPE SHADY?

12:09.596 --> 12:10.497
>> I THOUGHT WE WERE PAST

12:10.497 --> 12:11.832
ALL THAT.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.933
>> WE WERE.

12:12.933 --> 12:13.834
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SHOULD HAVE

12:13.834 --> 12:15.869
STAYED, IN THE PAST.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.312
>> EXCUSE ME.

12:25.312 --> 12:25.979

>> NO THANKS.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.732
I DON'T DO AGED MEAT.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.267
>> OMAR, I NEED YOU FOR THIS.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.035
IT'S MORE THAN JUST

12:48.035 --> 12:49.369
A NETWORKING OPPORTUNITY.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.703
IT'S A TOTAL GAME CHANGER

12:50.703 --> 12:51.371
AND A CHANCE TO TAKE

12:51.371 --> 12:53.373
INDULGENCE TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

>> WHICH STILL BEGS THE

12:54.474 --> 12:55.876
QUESTION, WHY ME?

13:42.890 --> 13:43.656
>> HEY.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.525
>> SO WHAT ARE WE DOING

13:45.525 --> 13:47.260

WE AREN'T GONNA DO ANYTHING

13:50.730 --> 13:52.232
ABOUT THIS, T.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.733
YOU'RE GONNA LET ME HANDLE IT.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.414
FOR DISCUSSION.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.748
>> OH, IT'S OPEN.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.417
WE PARTNERS NOW.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.452
YOU CAN'T JUST SHUT ME OUT.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.727
