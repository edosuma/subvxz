WEBVTT

00:08.976 --> 00:10.511
OFFICER: Ma'am? I'm sorry,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.346
but I really need
to ask you some questions.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.149
JULIAN: Maura,
you've got to talk
to the cops.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.651
It's the only way
we can find your sister.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.853
OFFICER: Just try to relax.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.256
JULIAN: Maura,
where are you going?

00:25.126 --> 00:27.728
How could you let
this happen

00:27.761 --> 00:30.964
Do you finally believe
it's Emily now

00:30.998 --> 00:33.734
Or are you still
standing by her side?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.359
This is all your fault.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.097
I'm... I'm...
I'm going to fix this.

01:03.131 --> 01:06.066
OFFICER: Mr. Durand, they are
waiting for you outside.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.204
Thank you.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.877
REPORTER: Mr. Durand,
do you have a statement?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.646
REPORTER 2: Hey, hey,
Mr. Durand!

01:23.951 --> 01:25.153
What happened?

01:50.178 --> 01:53.147
MAN: Hey, what you got there?

02:40.294 --> 02:43.931
I've stood here before.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.802
As a... As an FBI agent,
I've...

02:48.836 --> 02:51.805
I've appealed to you for help
bringing criminals to justice.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.477
I'm not speaking today
as an agent.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.715
My family has been taken
from me.

03:05.519 --> 03:09.390
And I know the person
who has them and I...

03:11.692 --> 03:15.929
I... I know and I think
that she's listening now.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.368
Emily...

03:25.473 --> 03:27.808
Emily, I know you're hurting,

03:29.477 --> 03:32.012
and what you went through,
no one...

03:32.045 --> 03:33.847
No one should have
to go through,

03:33.881 --> 03:37.685
but I beg of you,
don't take this out
on Alice and Flynn.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.821
Remember who
you used to be,

03:40.854 --> 03:42.222
and do the right thing.

03:43.557 --> 03:48.362
Bring my wife and our son home.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.868
Please bring them home.
Thank you.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.108
Help!

04:35.142 --> 04:38.045
Help! Help!

04:53.927 --> 04:55.396
Flynn!

04:55.429 --> 04:56.830
Oh, my God, Flynn.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.931
Flynn!

04:59.232 --> 05:00.934
Wake up!

05:00.968 --> 05:02.636
Flynn!
FLYNN: Mom?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.109
Get down.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.895
Mom, don't go.
It's okay.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.167
Here, drink.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.669
I don't want to.
I want to go home.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.472
I know you do, honey,
but we can't do that right now.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.140
Please drink the water.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.785
Come here.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.354
FLYNN: Where are we?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.689
I don't know.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.858
What is this place?
I don't know.

06:34.061 --> 06:39.567
I know
your father is looking
for us right now,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.502
and he's gonna find us.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.040
We just have to stay strong
till he gets here.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.211
And then,
this will all fade away.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.514
Just like waking up.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.184
Can you hold on
until then, Flynn?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.488
Can you stay strong
for me?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.725
Don't worry.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.598
He's looking for us
right this second.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.101
Soon, this will all be over.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.976
OFFICER: Jack Byrne,
your bail's being posted.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.778
You're free to go.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.515
Watch your back
out there.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.458
LAURIE: Jack!

07:39.226 --> 07:40.828
Do I know you?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.530
You do now.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.633
I'm the one
who bailed you out.
Laurie Colson.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.937
Could we go someplace
and talk for a moment?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.404
Uh, yeah.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.006
There's a little place
up here.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.341
Okay.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.943
So I've been
following the case.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.911
Yeah, you and the rest
of the country.

07:57.945 --> 07:58.946
No, not like them.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.581
I think there's another side
to the story,

08:00.614 --> 08:03.250
and no one's telling it.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.653
See, I believe
your sister is innocent,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.955
and I think
I can help you.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.162
Wait a second.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.632
You're that reporter
Emily stabbed, aren't you?
Oh. Uh...

08:18.666 --> 08:20.534
What is this?
Is this some kind of stunt?

08:20.568 --> 08:22.703
No! Wait, please,
it's not a stunt.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.573
Yes. Yes, I am that reporter,
but this...this was my fault.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.907
I never should have
been there.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.609
Okay.
You'll notice,
I never pressed charges,

08:28.642 --> 08:30.143
and believe me, I could have.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.979
So what do you want?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.947
To tell Emily's story.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.616
With your help.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.251
I want an exclusive
with you, Jack.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.887
I'll pay you back the bail.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.222
No, forget about the money.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.092
All I ask is that you just take
some time to really consider it.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.093
Mull it over. Okay?

08:46.126 --> 08:49.129
And if it's still a no,
no hard feelings.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.865
You know,
if I gambled and lost,
I can live with that.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.602
But I am betting that you want
someone to tell her side.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.606
So...

08:59.773 --> 09:02.943
Anything you need, okay?
Anything at all.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.778
Call me.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.153
We just got an ID
on one of the bodies.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.726
Okay, forensics
are processing the bodies.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.393
They say the remains
have co-mingled,

09:20.427 --> 09:24.297
but they've managed to ID
the body that Emily uncovered.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.066
ERICSON: Dr. Lu-Fang Shen.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.569
Our earliest records
show Shen working at MIT,

09:29.603 --> 09:32.472
followed by a position
at Barrett House.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.608
It's a short-term base
for foster kids,

09:34.642 --> 09:37.310
it was ended up functioning
as an orphanage.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.181
That's Emily's orphanage.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.617
We need to look into it.
It's defunct.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.753
Shut down over a decade ago.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.554
CROWN: Well, let's look
for old employees.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.256
Dr. Shen has a brother.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.092
Erik Shen.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.557
JACK: Emily, it's me.
They arrested me.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.360
I couldn't call you.
I'm sorry, I couldn't call...

10:27.394 --> 10:28.929
Jack, Flynn's gone.
They took him.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.231
JACK: I know, Em, I know.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.667
And Nick thinks that I did it.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.536
And now he's going to be
wasting time looking for me.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.238
I know. Emily...

10:38.271 --> 10:40.240
I can't even turn
myself in, because no one's
going to believe me.

10:40.273 --> 10:44.144
Emily, listen to me.
This is why you need to find him
before it's too late, okay?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.313
God, Jack...

10:46.346 --> 10:48.148
I'm so tired, man.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.885
I'm so tired,
I can't do this anymore.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.554
JACK: Emily, you have
to stay focused. Listen to me.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.157
Now tell me, what did you find
out about Shen?

11:01.361 --> 11:02.830
Oh...

11:05.565 --> 11:07.667
Shen started
experimenting on kids.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.337
after he left MIT.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.007
There's two of them from
what I could find out,

11:16.109 --> 11:19.646
but they were being tortured
the same way that I was.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.681
One of them was a boy.
His name was Charles.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.583
He was at my orphanage
and the other one

11:23.616 --> 11:25.953
was a "Subject B."

11:27.788 --> 11:29.923
I think one of them
might be holding Flynn.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.093
Okay. So, is there anything
you need me to do?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.065
I need to find Charles.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.135
Erik Shen?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.403
Yeah.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.805
My name is Nick Durand. FBI.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.139
This is Detective Gibbs.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.708
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.745
I guess you guys
are real thorough, huh?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.983
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you mean.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.485
Was there anything
in Lu

11:58.518 --> 12:00.788
Anything to help the case?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.058
We've never been here,
Mr. Shen...

12:05.092 --> 12:07.928
Not you,
but the other agent.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.362
She came the other day.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.265
Asking about my brother
and his research.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.434
I gave her the key
to my storage room.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.748
NICK: Clear.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.350
GIBBS: Fellas, get to work.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.453
We need to find out
what she was after.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.936
JACK: Dad,
Emily needs help.

12:49.970 --> 12:53.306
Okay? I need your help.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.543
WARREN: Well...

12:58.045 --> 12:59.779
I'm proud of you, son.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.282
You are?

13:02.315 --> 13:04.284
Everything you're doing
for Emily,

13:04.317 --> 13:06.186
everything you've done
for me.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.089
Of course, I'm proud of you.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.492
I know you think
I was hard on you.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.726
Dad...

13:13.760 --> 13:15.262
Uh, it's okay.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.564
You can be honest.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.272
Growing up, yeah, I...

13:25.305 --> 13:26.840
I guess I felt,

13:26.874 --> 13:28.508
after Emily,

13:30.410 --> 13:33.146
there was no space left
in the family for me.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.482
All the love and the attention
went to her.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.688
That doesn't matter now.
It's in the past.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.024
It does matter.
It matters to me.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.595
I never meant
to make you feel that way.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.868
You were always
doing so well.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.769
Emily...

13:56.803 --> 13:58.605
You remember
how she was.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.577
I guess I thought
she needed more.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.415
I need you to know how...

14:08.448 --> 14:09.549
Dad...

14:10.617 --> 14:11.952
I know.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.621
I know.

14:19.759 --> 14:23.163
Okay, I've got a plan.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.616
Flynn, wake up.
What?

15:19.319 --> 15:23.523
Here, take it,
this one's not so moldy.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.272
Boo!

15:39.306 --> 15:41.841
You realize
what a cliche you are?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.011
At least I'm not
in senior care.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.046
How are you doing, Irv?

15:53.586 --> 15:55.522
I need a favor.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.990
I'm busy, Warren.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.026
Like, you think the pigeon's
gonna miss you?

15:59.059 --> 16:02.129
Come on, Irv.
It's for Emily.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.165
Heard about that.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.834
You gonna help me?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.936
Of course I'm going
to help you, Warren.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.771
What do you need?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.740
I gotta find a person.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.075
A kid, actually.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.609
Lost in the system?

16:16.643 --> 16:17.910
Worse, sadly.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.779
You still have friends
in family services?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.148
I do.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.083
If they're still alive.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.120
You gonna call 'em?
Yeah.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.756
Well, when?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.891
When I finish
feeding the bird.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.960
Well, how long
is that gonna take?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.029
It's done when it's done,
Warren

16:49.409 --> 16:50.710
Fuck!

17:01.854 --> 17:02.989
Jack, talk to me.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.424
'cause I can't do this
anymore, man.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.992
Everything I touch
just goes wrong.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.460
And now they got Flynn...
Emily...

17:07.494 --> 17:08.995
And I just got to sit here
and hide

17:09.028 --> 17:10.630
like some kind
of a fucking coward.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.898
Emily, Dad's here.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.400
He has news.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.105
Dad?

17:19.506 --> 17:22.609
Emily, we have the lead
you're looking for.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.678
You found Charles?

17:25.712 --> 17:29.015
WARREN: We found Charles.
Last name Avallone.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.583
He's in a mental facility.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.620
Low security,
but you'll need to break in.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.422
It won't be easy.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.324
I know.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.261
I love you.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.233
I love you too, Dad.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.721
FLYNN: Mommy,
stop squeezing. It hurts.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.324
I'm sorry.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.760
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.509
Mom!

19:09.182 --> 19:11.451
Please! No! No.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.085
No...

19:20.627 --> 19:25.398
This isn't real.
This isn't real.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.671
Get some rest, Pop.
WARREN: Yeah, yeah.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.577
His blood pressure
has never been this high.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.046
If you want your father
to stay healthy,

19:40.079 --> 19:42.749
you need to keep
his stress to a minimum.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.451
I understand.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.319
It won't happen again.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.991
NICK: Jack?

19:52.024 --> 19:53.326
What are you doing here?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.894
I'm just visiting
my father.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.062
Tell me something, Jack.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.364
Something that's
gonna help us
find her,

19:57.397 --> 19:58.798
because all of this
is on you.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.832
I don't know anything.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.634
Don't. Don't, Don't.
Don't lie to me.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.069
All of this
is on you now.
Nick...

20:03.102 --> 20:04.704
You realize that,
don't you, Jack?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.839
Stop!
Stop lying to me!

20:06.873 --> 20:09.642
You helped her
so she could take
my wife and my son.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.643
Her son. Her son.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.111
She is... She is sick.
She's sick.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.446
Don't you get that?
No, she's hurt!

20:13.480 --> 20:16.649
She is hurt and you hurt her.
Don't you get that?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.722
Now she didn't take
your family, Nick.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.692
Deep down,
you know that's true.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.627
Don't you think I want
to be on her side, Jack?

20:27.660 --> 20:28.995
Don't you think
that I want that?

20:29.028 --> 20:32.164
But all of the evidence,
all of it,
it all points to her.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.267
So if you have some way
that it doesn't,

20:34.301 --> 20:35.802
just tell me.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.138
Fine.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.440
I'll go talk
to your father.

20:40.473 --> 20:43.075
No. No, no.
He's been through enough.
Nick! Nick!

20:43.109 --> 20:44.811
NICK: Tell me
where your daughter is.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.447
You got a burner in here, huh?
You helping her?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.215
WARREN: You got some nerve
coming in here.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.418
My grandson and daughter
are out there!

20:51.451 --> 20:54.086
Why aren't you out there
where a man should be?

20:54.120 --> 20:57.189
You need to pick
a side, Warren.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.691
You need to pick a side.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.193
Your... Your daughter's
or your grandson's.

21:01.227 --> 21:03.330
You were never good
enough for her.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.598
She ran rings around you
as an agent.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.634
She's running rings
around you now.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.470
And when she's cleared her name
and caught this killer,

21:10.503 --> 21:12.572
she'll have made you
and the whole damn Bureau

21:12.605 --> 21:14.874
look like the morons you are.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.670
GIBBS: You're gonna
want to hear this.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.281
SHEN:  Do you know
what will happen to you

21:55.314 --> 21:57.484
if you disobey me?

21:57.517 --> 21:59.085
CHILD:  Bad things.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.722
SHEN: What kind of bad things?

22:04.491 --> 22:07.827
What kind of bad things?

22:07.860 --> 22:09.496
CHILD: Not breathing.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.565
SHEN: Who shall I hurt?

22:13.366 --> 22:15.835
Shall I hurt B?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.303
CHILD: No!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.305
SHEN: Shall I hurt you?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.107
CHILD: Yes.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.376
How many more
of these are there?

22:23.410 --> 22:24.944
Well, there's a whole box.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.680
Most of them are damaged,
but this is the clearest one.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.849
What do you make
of all of this?

22:29.882 --> 22:31.751
You think Emily
is one of those kids?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.986
Well, she's the right age,
but...

22:34.020 --> 22:35.187
I don't know.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.424
Let me listen
to that last part.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.528
SHEN:
You are a brave boy.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.195
Repeat after me.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.398
CHILD: I'm brave.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.934
SHEN: You are
my favorite boy,
Charles.

22:50.437 --> 22:53.473
MASK MAN:
Who shall I hurt

22:53.873 --> 22:55.442
Or her?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.718
Do you want
your mother to suffer?

23:11.057 --> 23:12.692
Who will it be?

23:14.193 --> 23:16.429
You or her?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.935
Do you want me
to hurt her?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.139
Hurt me.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.755
NICK: You got anything
on the boy from the tapes?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.057
Well, the team is going
as fast as they can.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.660
The orphanage was demolished
and replaced with a strip mall,

24:20.693 --> 24:22.461
and the records
are over 35 years old,

24:22.495 --> 24:25.031
and that's just the ones
that weren't destroyed.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.966
Nick?

24:26.999 --> 24:29.101
We're here.
I'll report back.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.972
ADMINISTRATOR:
And what can I do
for you gentlemen?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.674
Oh, we're the ones
that called

24:34.707 --> 24:37.476
about information
on a former professor,
Lu-Fang Shen.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.247
Have a seat.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.088
As I told your colleague
on the phone,

24:49.121 --> 24:50.389
we simply don't keep records

24:50.422 --> 24:53.526
of our professors'
personal lives.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.162
All I can give you is in here.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.668
Yeah, we're looking for more
off the record information.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.174
How long
have you worked here?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.776
Bill, is it?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.612
Uh, 21 years this April.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.114
So you remember Shen.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.755
Look, we're not
looking to get you
in any trouble here.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.026
I'm just trying to get
my family back.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.764
Your information
could help save them.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.369
I remember him.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.872
He was a big problem
for the university.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.310
He conducted psychological
trials for research,

25:44.343 --> 25:45.645
and some of them
are in the records.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.146
But some aren't.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.684
What kind of experiments?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.185
ADMINISTRATOR:
I don't know the details.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.756
But I do recall that some
students filed complaints.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.958
There were adverse effects.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.193
We shut it down.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.930
So you swept it under the rug
to avoid a scandal?

26:07.433 --> 26:10.302
Why did MIT hire him
to begin with

26:11.403 --> 26:13.105
What did he specialize in?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.841
What kind of work did he do?

26:20.446 --> 26:22.281
Okay, there was...

26:23.616 --> 26:25.017
One bit of scuttlebutt.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.953
A conspiracy theory
if you ask me,

26:26.986 --> 26:28.287
NICK: What was it?

26:30.857 --> 26:34.326
He was rumored
to be involved

26:34.360 --> 26:37.063
in government
research programs.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.199
Secret programs.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.270
That's not uncommon
with our institution.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.707
Yeah.
Tell us about these rumors.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.356
ALICE:  Flynn! Flynn!

27:06.258 --> 27:08.160
Flynn!

27:08.194 --> 27:10.797
Are you okay?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.102
It's okay.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.974
Why... Why are you wet?

27:26.112 --> 27:27.814
Hey, it's okay.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.782
Just tell me what happened.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.951
He put me in a tank.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.687
Did you see who it was?

27:34.721 --> 27:37.757
No. But I heard...

27:40.259 --> 27:42.061
Was it anyone you know?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.697
I couldn't tell.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.266
He made me hold my breath
under water.

27:47.299 --> 27:48.768
And that hurt.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.541
He said if I did it,
you wouldn't have to.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.810
So now, you don't have to.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.716
I'll call Nick.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.489
Nick. We got a solid match.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.024
There was a Charles
at Barrett House

28:45.057 --> 28:46.425
during the target time frame.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.829
Charles Avallone.
Sending you
the details now.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.340
NICK: He's at Edgewater
Psychiatric Facility.

29:03.175 --> 29:06.212
GIBBS: It's a 15-minute drive
from here. Let's go.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.222
Psst.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.125
Hey!

29:54.593 --> 29:56.095
Come here.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.369
Hi.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.372
Are you real?

30:09.041 --> 30:10.209
No.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.379
I didn't think so.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.149
I like your robe.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.088
I like candy.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.900
Okay.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.621
WOMAN: Hey! Hey! Stop!

30:56.488 --> 30:58.457
Stop, Hey, you. Stop!

30:59.691 --> 31:01.293
They didn't notice you,

31:01.660 --> 31:03.062
but I did.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.931
You're not supposed
to be here.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.266
I got to tell everyone
we have a visitor.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.870
Hey, everyone!
EMILY: Wait, wait, wait!

31:11.904 --> 31:13.672
I'm looking for somebody.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.708
Charles Avallone.
He's in here.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.111
Do you know him?
I know everyone.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.354
EMILY: So what's your name?

31:28.387 --> 31:30.289
NICK: Nick.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.890
EMILY: Emily.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.752
EMILY: I'm sorry.
Are you Jenny's roommate?

32:00.786 --> 32:02.254
Yeah.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.156
EMILY: I think she's
having problems with
the bouncer outside.

32:04.190 --> 32:07.226
GIRL: Oh shit,
I'll be right back.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.175
So what's your name?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.344
Nick.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.047
Emily.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.716
So did her roommate really
have trouble with the bouncer?

32:33.019 --> 32:35.054
Or are you just
making that up?

32:35.087 --> 32:36.788
Kinda cocky, aren't you?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.592
I made it up.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.631
Nice.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.106
Do you like to dance,
Nick?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.175
No.
No?

32:56.208 --> 32:57.576
Come on. Let's go.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.522
We're close. Are you okay?

33:11.390 --> 33:14.493
Yeah. I'm good, I'm fine.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.996
Good. Keep sharp.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.969
MOLLY: Finding Charles
is easy.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.972
He's in lockdown
in a dungeon.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.741
Behind a locked door
at the end of the hall.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.611
But be careful.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.047
He hurts people.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.149
He's very strong.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.154
That guy has the key
to the dungeon.

33:42.188 --> 33:45.691
At medicine bell,
I'll make a distraction,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.426
and you'll steal the key.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.661
We have to be
really, really quick.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.369
I'm agent Nick Durand.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.338
I need to speak with
one of your patients,
Charles Avallone.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.740
We'd also like
all his records
and visitor logs.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.727
You have approximately
8.4 minutes. Bye!

35:09.908 --> 35:11.610
GIBBS: Thank you.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.713
What's going on?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.715
RECEPTIONIST: Don't worry.
It happens a lot.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.284
Charles...

35:57.523 --> 35:59.991
Charles! Wait!

36:00.025 --> 36:01.627
Charles!

36:17.809 --> 36:19.245
Thank you.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.134
You were mean to us!

36:43.168 --> 36:45.871
You're a bad person!
You made us hurt!

36:51.009 --> 36:52.744
We remember you.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.581
Emily.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.720
Ow!

37:07.893 --> 37:09.060
Ow!
I'm sorry, Charles.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.262
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.197
I just need to know
what happened.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.933
Did Dr. Shen hurt you?
He was a bad man.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.167
Yes. Yes, he was.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.003
Did he hurt anyone else?

37:18.036 --> 37:20.372
I need to know
what happened, please!

37:20.406 --> 37:21.807
We will never help you.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.343
You are not good.
You don't get help!

37:24.376 --> 37:26.211
Did Dr. Shen hurt
anyone else?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.413
Tell me!

37:27.446 --> 37:29.415
Who was with you and Shen?

37:30.716 --> 37:32.884
B.
Yes, B.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.119
You were Subject A,

37:34.152 --> 37:35.787
the other child was Subject B.
Who is he?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.491
B is for book.
Give us our book.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.860
No! Stay with me.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.162
Give us our book!

37:44.195 --> 37:45.364
Charles, stay with me.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.499
How are you protecting?
Give us our book!

37:47.533 --> 37:49.134
We need our book!
No.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.802
PATIENT: No!

37:51.903 --> 37:53.405
Charles is out!

37:54.540 --> 37:56.342
He's fighting the woman!

37:56.375 --> 37:58.477
He's fighting the woman!

38:10.622 --> 38:12.858
PATIENT:
Charles is fighting the woman!

38:14.993 --> 38:17.028
He's fighting the woman!

38:17.062 --> 38:18.730
Charles is out!

38:18.764 --> 38:20.399
Help!

38:23.869 --> 38:26.638
They're fighting!
They're fighting!

38:26.672 --> 38:29.608
Help! Help! They're fighting!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.777
Charles is fighting that woman!

38:31.810 --> 38:34.613
Charles is fighting the woman!

38:34.646 --> 38:36.748
Help! Help!

38:39.585 --> 38:42.087
NICK: Don't move, Emily!
Don't move!

38:48.193 --> 38:50.829
NICK: Emily,
don't make me do this.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.066
Just tell me where they are.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.275
Don't, don't,
don't, don't...

39:04.309 --> 39:05.877
I told you not to move.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.418
Put your hands
where I can see them.

39:12.451 --> 39:16.054
Emily, put your hands
where I can see them,

39:16.087 --> 39:18.757
and turn around slowly.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.038
Why are you doing this?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.742
Can't you see
you're hurting him?

39:38.644 --> 39:41.112
How can you say that to me?

39:48.253 --> 39:50.789
I am trying to save Flynn.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.032
This is over.

40:03.469 --> 40:05.537
I'm done believing you.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.376
You need to let me go.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.178
Put the gun down.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.647
Now.
