01:01.085 --> 01:03.005
Is it done?

01:03.125 --> 01:06.559
Yes. Our friend is fodder for the worms!

01:06.583 --> 01:09.343
Good. Let's go.

01:13.338 --> 01:16.430
_

01:17.023 --> 01:18.863
We're likely looking
for a shallow grave.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.538
Murderers never dig deep. They're
in a hurry to be rid of the body.

01:21.839 --> 01:24.098
Or can't be bothered to dig any further.

01:24.439 --> 01:26.586
- Let's try by the river.
- Why?

01:27.094 --> 01:29.004
Just seems a restful place.

01:29.221 --> 01:32.685
Higgins, we're looking for a
burial site not a picnic spot, man!

01:32.725 --> 01:34.082
Over here!

01:34.635 --> 01:36.027
I don't believe it.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.580
Eureka! Ha!

01:40.241 --> 01:42.507
Congratulations, Constable Jackson,

01:42.759 --> 01:45.310
- you found our friend!
- Ah!

01:46.001 --> 01:47.146
Ha!

01:47.531 --> 01:48.844
Thank you, Doctor.

01:49.101 --> 01:51.138
I believe you gents
owe me five cents each.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.616
We made a little wager

01:53.631 --> 01:55.940
as to who would find your
cadaver first, Doctor.

01:56.645 --> 01:58.703
Good, you've embraced the
first part of my training

01:58.738 --> 02:00.568
exercise with enthusiasm.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.266
Constables.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.157
Miss James, as well as
Miss Baxter and Miss Roy

02:05.172 --> 02:07.575
from the Medical College
for Women are joining us.

02:08.146 --> 02:10.215
Once the Constabulary finds a body

02:10.225 --> 02:12.910
buried under suspicious
circumstances, Medical Inspectors,

02:12.940 --> 02:15.610
or Coroners, are called to the
scene to give their opinion.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.219
Definitely deceased.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.254
- Definitely.
- Thank you, ladies.

02:20.506 --> 02:23.157
Medical Inspectors should
always have an opportunity

02:23.181 --> 02:24.834
to view the body before it is moved.

02:24.849 --> 02:28.151
It is their responsibility to
unlock the corpse's secrets,

02:28.185 --> 02:31.418
some of which can only be
ascertained at the crime scene.

02:31.538 --> 02:34.425
As constables and
doctors working together,

02:34.545 --> 02:38.371
it is your task to determine
identity and time of death.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.065
To that end, collect whatever you need.

02:41.258 --> 02:44.168
We should look for insect
activity and patterns.

02:44.202 --> 02:46.345
Yes. And consider the soil conditions.

02:46.371 --> 02:48.820
What difference does it make
where the fellow was buried?

02:48.940 --> 02:51.191
The presence of micro-organisms,

02:51.240 --> 02:54.448
moisture and warmth are all
factors that help determine

02:54.473 --> 02:56.836
the rate of decomposition
and the time of death.

02:56.956 --> 02:58.963
Oh God!

02:58.988 --> 03:01.166
Perhaps we should...
work on the windward side.

03:01.193 --> 03:04.442
That's a helpful idea. I wish you luck!

03:07.117 --> 03:08.242
Ladies.

03:14.978 --> 03:17.101
I see not even a decomposing corpse

03:17.111 --> 03:18.700
could dampen your appetite!

03:18.981 --> 03:20.037
Ah!

03:20.260 --> 03:21.667
I should say not.

03:21.948 --> 03:24.563
Post-mortems should never be
conducted on an empty stomach.

03:24.683 --> 03:26.281
Hm. I must say,

03:26.518 --> 03:28.373
a joint forensics exercise

03:28.398 --> 03:30.501
on our land is a brilliant idea, Julia.

03:30.530 --> 03:33.259
Well, we'll see what the
constables and doctors come up with.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.119
When are the builders arriving?

03:35.239 --> 03:37.242
Sometime this week, they claim.

03:37.405 --> 03:40.280
- Oh we'll be long gone by then.
- Hm!

03:40.596 --> 03:43.256
Whoa!

03:43.376 --> 03:44.846
Oh!

03:48.431 --> 03:49.602
Hello!

03:50.867 --> 03:52.169
Good day.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.513
Good day!

03:54.871 --> 03:57.289
I'm Barry Biggs. Frank Walsh.

03:57.409 --> 04:00.224
- You the new people?
- Yes, William Murdoch,

04:00.274 --> 04:02.378
- my wife, Julia.
- Hello.

04:02.735 --> 04:05.011
Our family farms are over yonder.

04:06.794 --> 04:09.107
Farming accident.

04:09.227 --> 04:10.360
Ah!

04:10.372 --> 04:12.698
So, are you planning on
living in this tent, then?

04:13.518 --> 04:16.070
No, no, we plan on building a house.

04:16.099 --> 04:17.831
Builders out there digging?

04:17.880 --> 04:21.206
Uh, no, that's an experiment the
Detective and I are conducting.

04:21.236 --> 04:24.235
Oh, police are you? How much
did old Dawson soak you for?

04:24.439 --> 04:26.734
I believe we settled fairly.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.221
I don't know if this
old place is worth much,

04:29.611 --> 04:32.042
with the river overflowing
the banks every spring.

04:32.077 --> 04:33.667
Best watch that.

04:33.787 --> 04:37.047
Oh, I intend to build a
fair ways from the river.

04:37.266 --> 04:39.481
The maples to the west,
there, will need some pruning,

04:39.540 --> 04:41.741
else a wind'll put a limb
right through your roof.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.923
Now, you are planning on
building a roof I take it.

04:49.937 --> 04:50.786
Ugh!

04:51.033 --> 04:54.365
Why such a foul odour
when it's a new corpse?

04:54.873 --> 04:57.573
Doctor Ogden likely buried
the body shortly after death.

04:57.602 --> 05:01.650
And I believe decomposition doesn't
begin in earnest until it's...

05:01.877 --> 05:03.465
exposed to oxygen.

05:03.648 --> 05:04.970
Correct, Constable.

05:05.090 --> 05:07.749
Can you take hold of this tape?
We need one more measurement.

05:07.783 --> 05:09.521
Oh! Allow me!

05:09.540 --> 05:11.633
We can't let you ladies
put us to shame here...

05:11.825 --> 05:14.317
OH! UGH! I KISSED IT!!

05:14.352 --> 05:16.409
- OH!
- Ah!

05:16.976 --> 05:19.518
Judging from the size of the
larynx, the cadaver is male.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.048
From the remaining muscularity

05:21.067 --> 05:22.799
we deduce he was likely a working man.

05:23.165 --> 05:26.969
- He was 5 feet 11 inches in height.
- Are you sure?

05:27.532 --> 05:30.341
Quite sure. We took careful
measurement of the long bones.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.070
And his teeth suggest he
was 35 to 40 years old.

05:33.288 --> 05:36.042
So, a tall man in his late thirties,

05:36.056 --> 05:37.976
- likely a labourer?
- Yes.

05:38.176 --> 05:41.224
Well that is a
comprehensive description.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.570
There's only one problem:

05:45.497 --> 05:47.806
this is not the cadaver I buried.

05:50.891 --> 05:53.472
But you marked the burial
site, did you not, Doctor?

05:53.516 --> 05:57.108
Of course. Animals or
weather likely moved it.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.640
William!

06:00.504 --> 06:01.619
Detective Watts.

06:01.639 --> 06:03.771
I heard you had found
an unidentified corpse.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.370
I was hoping to take a
gander. Male or female?

06:06.404 --> 06:08.013
- Male.
- Ah.

06:08.255 --> 06:09.454
So I see.

06:11.043 --> 06:14.043
Detective Watts has been on the
hunt for a number of missing women.

06:14.045 --> 06:16.747
Some of them have been gone
a considerable amount of time.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.250
- I'm sorry I can't help you.
- That's all right.

06:19.322 --> 06:22.090
It means the people I am
searching for may still be alive.

06:22.253 --> 06:23.660
Youth and optimism.

06:23.694 --> 06:25.782
It's a delightful
combination, Detective Watts.

06:25.857 --> 06:28.535
Uh, though not helpful in this instance.

06:28.782 --> 06:29.853
Good day.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.220
So ladies,

06:34.664 --> 06:37.067
- who is this?
- I have no idea.

06:37.389 --> 06:39.329
but it seems he was beaten to death.

06:39.398 --> 06:42.867
Multiple fractures on his
skull and defensive injuries.

06:42.941 --> 06:44.199
He put up quite the fight,

06:44.214 --> 06:46.617
judging from the severe
blows to his hands.

06:46.652 --> 06:48.705
From the size and
shape of the contusions,

06:48.825 --> 06:50.541
they were inflicted with some force.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.406
Likely with a hammer.

06:53.442 --> 06:56.057
So, we have an unidentified murdered man

06:56.072 --> 06:57.883
buried on our land, Julia.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.824
Any idea how long he's been here?

07:01.327 --> 07:03.123
At least a year, I'd say.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.906
We'll work on establishing a
more accurate time of death.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.442
We'll conduct the post-mortem
right away, Miss James.

07:08.501 --> 07:09.636
Out here?

07:10.164 --> 07:12.551
We may as well take
advantage of the fresh air.

07:12.671 --> 07:15.157
And my students still
have a body to find.

07:15.473 --> 07:16.609
Hm!

07:17.082 --> 07:19.969
Indentations in the land
are a clear sign of a grave,

07:19.978 --> 07:21.766
but so too can be vegetation.

07:21.790 --> 07:23.749
The Detective once found a body ...

07:23.869 --> 07:26.885
well, a skeleton, I suppose
by observing a nonnative plant

07:26.920 --> 07:29.253
- amongst the wild species.
- But the dead are dead.

07:29.287 --> 07:30.523
Beyond help.

07:30.903 --> 07:33.054
Caring for the living
interests me far more.

07:33.804 --> 07:36.133
Then, why are you here, may I ask?

07:36.163 --> 07:38.334
I needed an excuse to avoid a wedding.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.945
Well, I'm telling you,
there's nothing more satisfying

07:40.960 --> 07:41.972
than solving a murder.

07:41.992 --> 07:44.622
Just last year we found
these gold-plated statues

07:44.657 --> 07:46.636
that turned out to be human bod...

07:47.233 --> 07:48.437
Look here.

07:50.391 --> 07:51.950
See these flowers?

07:52.351 --> 07:55.112
They're the only one of
their kind in this area.

07:55.682 --> 07:57.381
The soil here is richer,

07:57.883 --> 07:58.979
possibly...

07:59.645 --> 08:01.925
fertilized by organic matter.

08:02.492 --> 08:04.205
Like a rotting corpse?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.436
You're a quick study, Miss Baxter.

08:09.787 --> 08:11.446
I don't recall burying the body

08:11.452 --> 08:12.943
this close to the river, Julia.

08:12.982 --> 08:14.428
Yes. Well, according to the neighbours,

08:14.448 --> 08:16.220
the shoreline changes every year.

08:18.548 --> 08:20.458
- Sir.
- What have you?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.546
Looking at the size of these boots,

08:22.571 --> 08:24.382
I would say we're looking at a man.

08:24.599 --> 08:26.825
It's not him. This is not my cadaver.

08:28.562 --> 08:30.585
- Are you sure, Julia?
- Yes.

08:30.783 --> 08:33.008
The body I buried wasn't wearing boots.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.215
What else are we gonna find?

08:45.281 --> 08:46.584
What do you have there?

08:47.231 --> 08:48.292
A bullet.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.329
Murder, then.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.091
Sir,

08:52.476 --> 08:55.215
it seems somebody's making
foul use of your land.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.290
Indeed. It seems we're
harvesting bodies.

09:10.123 --> 09:11.475
Observations?

09:11.648 --> 09:13.617
As this one is a pile of bones

09:13.644 --> 09:15.324
and the first body much less decayed,

09:15.334 --> 09:18.704
it would appear that they were
killed months, if not years, apart.

09:19.445 --> 09:21.345
There are furrows in the soil

09:21.465 --> 09:24.034
from the maggots leaving in
droves after polishing off

09:24.044 --> 09:26.907
- the flesh of the corpse.
- Two dead bodies, William.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.592
Who did you say you
bought this land from?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.102
A man named Dawson.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.891
I never met him, his lawyer
handled the transaction.

09:34.011 --> 09:35.371
George, I'll need your assistance

09:35.386 --> 09:37.206
- down at the Station House.
- Sir.

09:38.297 --> 09:40.497
Let me know how you
fare with an identity

09:40.502 --> 09:42.121
- and a time of death, Doctor.
- Oh!

09:42.150 --> 09:44.223
Throwing down a rather large gauntlet,

09:44.241 --> 09:46.809
- wouldn't you say, Miss James?
- Indeed.

09:50.397 --> 09:52.081
Constable Jackson?

09:52.554 --> 09:54.726
- Yes.
- Constable Crabtree suggests

09:54.745 --> 09:57.405
we keep looking for Doctor
Ogden's missing cadaver.

09:57.913 --> 10:00.810
Yes, great, I'm...
Yeah, I'm... I'm ready.

10:00.849 --> 10:03.248
- Excellent. Let's get going.
- There ya go.

10:03.549 --> 10:04.634
Wait.

10:05.329 --> 10:06.880
You're leaving me with a constable

10:06.895 --> 10:08.558
who does nothing but leer?

10:08.559 --> 10:10.405
Thank you very much.

10:10.439 --> 10:12.176
He's not all that bad.

10:12.339 --> 10:14.911
You just have to give him
really clear instruction.

10:14.941 --> 10:16.653
I have a better idea, Anne.

10:16.773 --> 10:19.368
We work on the soil research and

10:19.417 --> 10:21.878
leave the constables to
tramp around the land.

10:23.592 --> 10:25.121
Sorry to desert you.

10:25.866 --> 10:27.485
Shall we, Constable?

10:27.518 --> 10:30.086
Yes, we shall.

10:42.512 --> 10:44.782
All this area north of the city

10:44.802 --> 10:47.610
would have been settled
by farmers in the 1840's.

10:47.950 --> 10:50.946
As the city began to
encroach in the last decade,

10:50.975 --> 10:53.596
developers started to
buy up the land including,

10:53.616 --> 10:56.158
I expect, our Mr. Dawson.

10:56.710 --> 10:59.459
From everything I hear, sir,
he seems a slippery fish,

10:59.509 --> 11:01.298
always hiding behind his lawyer.

11:01.355 --> 11:03.353
Hm... How long did he own the land?

11:03.387 --> 11:05.736
Three years. He owes
money left and right, sir.

11:05.743 --> 11:07.959
What's more, he's skipped
out on his landlord.

11:08.018 --> 11:10.870
- Right. Try to find him.
- Sir.

11:11.334 --> 11:13.411
Perhaps your neighbour would
know something about him.

11:14.354 --> 11:16.132
That would be...

11:17.684 --> 11:19.727
... Alvin Nash.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.691
Mr. Nash!

11:31.977 --> 11:34.450
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.367
You bought the place up the road.

11:36.378 --> 11:38.335
- Yes, I did.
- So, neighbours.

11:38.776 --> 11:41.939
Well, eventually, we
haven't broken ground yet.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.595
This is my wife, Mavis.
My daughter, Dorothy.

11:45.926 --> 11:48.309
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Good day.

11:48.429 --> 11:50.180
Mavis doesn't say much.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.487
We're doing our best to keep
her happy, aren't we, Dorothy?

11:53.689 --> 11:55.106
We are that.

11:55.841 --> 12:00.293
Um, Mr. Nash, if I may, what
do you know about Mr. Dawson,

12:00.328 --> 12:02.103
the previous owner of my land?

12:02.424 --> 12:05.020
Dawson, no. He kept to himself.

12:05.977 --> 12:07.275
Why are you asking?

12:07.857 --> 12:11.396
Well, we discovered two
graves on the property.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.674
You don't say...

12:12.891 --> 12:14.658
- on the Dawson land?
- Yes.

12:15.788 --> 12:17.535
See, Dorothy, what'd I tell you?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.930
I always thought there was
something funny about him.

12:20.964 --> 12:22.254
What do you mean?

12:23.083 --> 12:24.554
Dawson hardly ever came up here.

12:24.563 --> 12:26.009
But when he did, it was at night.

12:26.409 --> 12:28.269
We seen him one time, Dorothy and me,

12:28.272 --> 12:30.288
lifting something heavy off a wagon.

12:30.574 --> 12:31.620
What was it?

12:31.654 --> 12:34.241
I don't know. It was
wrapped in a tarpaulin.

12:34.675 --> 12:35.908
When was this?

12:36.678 --> 12:39.930
That would've been just after
I got out of the sanitarium.

12:39.955 --> 12:42.521
That was two years ago. Maybe longer.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.021
Did you not suspect anything?

12:45.055 --> 12:47.139
Pff... His business, not mine.

12:47.174 --> 12:49.962
Whoever thinks a neighbour
is burying bodies?

12:53.886 --> 12:56.269
That's Frank and Barry.

12:56.590 --> 12:57.873
They're good lads.

12:57.887 --> 12:59.773
They help me keep the place going now.

13:07.596 --> 13:10.547
- Out of the way! Out of the way!
- I'm walking here...

13:10.602 --> 13:12.031
Miss Cherry?

13:12.536 --> 13:14.298
For the love of...

13:14.320 --> 13:16.129
Hello Constable Crabtree.

13:16.472 --> 13:17.522
Do you like it?

13:17.642 --> 13:19.009
I do!

13:19.073 --> 13:22.671
I'm the proud owner. Almost,
that is. I'm on a trial drive.

13:23.337 --> 13:25.189
This must cost a fortune.

13:25.309 --> 13:27.630
It does, but it's still a bargain.

13:27.664 --> 13:29.142
The owner only wants $100.

13:29.221 --> 13:31.269
A hundred dollars, that's far too cheap.

13:31.309 --> 13:32.903
There must be something wrong with it.

13:33.697 --> 13:35.619
I thought it was too good to be true.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.007
Well at least I got
to take it for a spin.

13:38.233 --> 13:40.212
I look pretty good behind
the wheel, don't you think?

13:40.775 --> 13:42.102
You do!

13:42.586 --> 13:44.294
You know, maybe somebody
could look at it for you.

13:44.308 --> 13:46.317
- Take a peek under the hood.
- Who?

13:46.829 --> 13:48.413
I just might know somebody.

13:49.227 --> 13:52.369
It must be quite rewarding,
you saving people.

13:52.578 --> 13:54.538
I'm not quite a doctor yet.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.301
I still have a residency to
complete, but my studies are finished.

13:59.763 --> 14:01.195
Can I ask you a question?

14:01.540 --> 14:02.779
Certainly.

14:03.371 --> 14:05.192
What do you know about dropsy?

14:05.424 --> 14:08.656
Dropsy, such an odd word.

14:08.690 --> 14:12.672
Um, it's swelling caused by
accumulation of fluid in the body.

14:12.934 --> 14:15.850
It usually happens because the
heart isn't pumping efficiently.

14:16.346 --> 14:18.075
Heart. I see.

14:18.195 --> 14:20.552
Quite difficult to treat, unfortunately.

14:21.391 --> 14:22.561
Oh!

14:22.793 --> 14:24.017
Clumsy oaf!

14:24.137 --> 14:27.802
Wait. An indentation is exactly

14:27.922 --> 14:31.430
what Constable Crabtree said
to look for. Hand me that spade.

14:36.271 --> 14:38.013
Fascinating.

14:38.630 --> 14:41.452
Let me guess. This
still is not your corpse.

14:41.488 --> 14:43.008
No, not mine.

14:43.763 --> 14:47.114
This looks like a more
recent burial, Doctor.

14:47.499 --> 14:49.779
Puncture wounds to the abdomen.

14:49.899 --> 14:52.671
A better name for your body
farm might well be murder farm.

14:54.921 --> 14:56.954
The bullet in the skull of the corpse

14:57.025 --> 14:58.928
was from a hunting rifle.

14:59.925 --> 15:02.130
His left femur was broken in two places,

15:02.150 --> 15:05.684
- likely pre-mortem.
- Really? Strange.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.225
The next one to die was
the first body we found.

15:08.674 --> 15:11.537
Beaten to death but he
put up quite a fight.

15:11.861 --> 15:14.740
The third victim was only
buried in the last month or so.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.403
So, after we purchased the land, Julia?

15:18.411 --> 15:20.128
He was stabbed with a pitchfork.

15:20.147 --> 15:22.620
Judging by the puncture wounds,

15:22.664 --> 15:24.841
one of the tines was
shorter than the others,

15:24.846 --> 15:26.553
worn down by use, no doubt.

15:26.673 --> 15:29.153
- Hm...
- Unload here, lads.

15:29.538 --> 15:30.782
Who's that?

15:31.977 --> 15:33.512
The builders.

15:36.863 --> 15:40.795
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry,
but there's a problem.

15:40.915 --> 15:42.597
Well, you did book us to start today.

15:42.621 --> 15:45.168
I understand that, but
unfortunately this land

15:45.178 --> 15:47.878
has become the site of
a police investigation.

15:51.238 --> 15:54.766
So, why did you ask
about dropsy? You seem...

15:55.235 --> 15:57.673
too robust to have heart problems.

15:57.984 --> 16:00.929
Uh, no, it's not me. My...

16:01.645 --> 16:04.487
... my wife died some years ago.

16:06.155 --> 16:07.581
Oh no, I...

16:07.744 --> 16:09.723
They said it was to do with her dropsy.

16:10.764 --> 16:12.369
I didn't know what that was.

16:13.143 --> 16:14.589
I suppose they didn't explain it to me

16:14.609 --> 16:16.791
- because they didn't think I'd understand.
- What?

16:18.192 --> 16:20.729
That's no way to treat
a bereaved husband.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.676
She never did have a
strong constitution,

16:23.691 --> 16:25.680
so her passing wasn't a surprise.

16:28.181 --> 16:29.825
Sweet girl, she was.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.301
I'm so sorry.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.433
Thank you for the explanation.

16:39.981 --> 16:41.531
It's a comfort to know.

16:47.601 --> 16:49.594
Constable Jackson...

16:50.832 --> 16:51.804
Huh!

16:51.839 --> 16:54.785
There appears to be a lot of
animal activity right there.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.844
I wonder what they were after.

17:02.740 --> 17:04.329
Finally!

17:04.935 --> 17:07.013
Congratulations, you two.

17:07.034 --> 17:08.790
If you don't mind me asking, Doctor,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.227
where did you get him from?

17:10.347 --> 17:11.713
The subject saw the value

17:11.737 --> 17:14.096
of donating his body
to scientific research.

17:14.126 --> 17:15.887
So let's make good use of it.

17:18.794 --> 17:21.893
You know, I'm not sure that
there are no more bodies

17:21.913 --> 17:23.547
yet to be found, Constable.

17:23.996 --> 17:26.112
Then, perhaps we should
keep looking, Miss Baxter.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.777
Please, call me Anne.

17:29.335 --> 17:30.554
Mr. Dawson.

17:30.756 --> 17:32.232
Detective Murdoch.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.801
Has your lawyer explained why
you're being questioned today?

17:37.162 --> 17:39.945
Something about the land I sold you.

17:40.986 --> 17:42.914
Judging by your demeanor...

17:43.578 --> 17:45.793
maybe I should have brought him along.

17:47.861 --> 17:50.027
You owned the property for three years,

17:50.056 --> 17:52.109
yet you never built on it.

17:52.292 --> 17:55.011
The city's moving north; I
thought it was a good investment.

17:55.569 --> 17:58.495
Land prices haven't
increased significantly, so

17:58.508 --> 18:00.272
why sell?

18:00.846 --> 18:04.559
To be truthful, my vision tends
to exceed my business acumen.

18:04.679 --> 18:06.526
Is this why I'm here?

18:08.925 --> 18:11.269
We're investigating three murders.

18:11.389 --> 18:14.390
Three bodies were buried on that land.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.848
Bodies?

18:17.129 --> 18:19.485
And you think I had
something to do with it?

18:19.886 --> 18:21.540
Did you?

18:21.836 --> 18:23.773
Look, I've, uh,

18:23.893 --> 18:26.789
dodged the law, taxes and
that, but I'm no murderer.

18:26.826 --> 18:28.997
I hardly went near the place.

18:29.349 --> 18:31.890
There have been reports
that you were seen there

18:31.927 --> 18:34.321
late at night. Explain that.

18:35.709 --> 18:37.948
I'm a bit of an amateur astronomer.

18:37.966 --> 18:41.229
Sometimes I'd drive up
there with my telescope to...

18:41.574 --> 18:45.048
look at the stars without
the lights of the city.

18:45.782 --> 18:48.434
And while you were there,
did you ever witness any

18:48.471 --> 18:50.741
disturbances on the property?

18:50.861 --> 18:54.264
- It was usually dark as pitch.
- Of course.

18:55.387 --> 18:57.089
Can you think

18:57.123 --> 18:59.105
of any reason why someone

18:59.105 --> 19:01.647
would bury bodies on my land?

19:04.140 --> 19:06.582
It could have something to
do with the Hobbins family.

19:06.625 --> 19:09.765
- Who are they?
- They were one of the first families up there.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.799
Had a place further north.

19:11.813 --> 19:13.466
Thought they owned the whole county.

19:13.842 --> 19:15.582
Liars and cheats by all accounts.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.796
No reason to think
they'd stop at murder.

19:18.302 --> 19:21.318
- Do they still live there?
- I don't know.

19:21.438 --> 19:23.601
But I'd stay clear if I were you.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.402
Badge or no badge.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.365
Excuse me.

19:36.485 --> 19:37.944
What?

19:38.382 --> 19:40.948
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.909
I have nothing to say to the police.

19:44.278 --> 19:47.128
Is this the home of a William Hobbins?

19:47.172 --> 19:48.947
Get a judge's warrant.

19:54.018 --> 19:57.158
Sir, you likely met Minnie
Hobbins, William's daughter.

19:57.176 --> 19:59.304
By all accounts she's a
real chip off the old block.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.345
I anticipate no shortage of
colour in their history, George.

20:02.370 --> 20:05.751
Indeed not, sir. They've
cut a swath of violence

20:05.794 --> 20:08.878
and intimidation since they
arrived from England in 1870.

20:08.897 --> 20:11.296
They set up house in the north
part of the county and just

20:11.330 --> 20:13.632
decided it was their
own personal fiefdom.

20:13.666 --> 20:16.349
- Any arrest record?
- Plenty of arrests, sir.

20:16.361 --> 20:18.625
Robbery, intimidation,
suspected in a number of

20:18.656 --> 20:21.777
violent homicides, but no
jail time until recently.

20:22.067 --> 20:24.374
- What happened?
- Well, two and half years ago,

20:24.374 --> 20:26.459
William and his two
sons, Patrick and Daniel,

20:26.465 --> 20:28.519
were finally sentenced
for illegal liquor running.

20:28.550 --> 20:30.795
They're all locked up in
Kingston Penitentiary now.

20:31.184 --> 20:34.095
Well, it seems we may
have found our murderers.

20:34.215 --> 20:36.649
- Off to Kingston, then.
- Right.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.250
- Yes, George?
- Sir, I was just wondering

20:44.268 --> 20:45.743
if you needed any further assistance.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.865
Uh, Miss Cherry had
asked me to assist her

20:47.880 --> 20:50.456
- in the purchase of an automobile.
- Miss Cherry?

20:50.871 --> 20:52.731
The reporter, sir. Surely you remember.

20:52.775 --> 20:54.202
Of course I do.

20:54.769 --> 20:57.868
She seems full of bright
ideas and energy, George.

20:58.377 --> 21:00.879
- An auto suits her.
- Yes indeed, it does, sir.

21:01.822 --> 21:02.848
Right.

21:10.607 --> 21:13.783
There is a species of moth
which hatches in open wounds.

21:14.026 --> 21:16.745
In the process, it excretes a
mucus which seals the lesion.

21:16.819 --> 21:18.853
Preventing other insects from entering.

21:18.863 --> 21:21.113
Which would explain why there
is so little insect activity

21:21.143 --> 21:23.136
- in such a recent corpse.
- Yes,

21:23.256 --> 21:25.342
yet it still gives us no further insight

21:25.367 --> 21:27.148
as to when the third victim was killed

21:27.158 --> 21:29.004
or when he was buried.

21:29.049 --> 21:31.076
I wonder if the students
are having more luck.

21:31.196 --> 21:32.360
I'll see.

21:33.791 --> 21:35.089
Miss Roy.

21:36.397 --> 21:38.258
We're testing each soil sample,

21:38.292 --> 21:41.199
measuring the moisture retention
of the different types of soil

21:41.229 --> 21:42.699
in which the bodies were found.

21:42.773 --> 21:44.219
Any results so far?

21:44.284 --> 21:46.814
It's too premature to
draw any conclusions.

21:46.934 --> 21:49.775
Happy though I am to be
working with you, Miss Roy,

21:49.795 --> 21:52.159
I don't know why you are
having me repeat this test.

21:52.707 --> 21:54.701
What's the complaint now, Constable?

21:54.821 --> 21:59.157
Well, this soil from Dr.
Ogden's body site... it's clay.

21:59.191 --> 22:01.621
The same type of soil the
first body was found in.

22:01.634 --> 22:03.362
It's a waste of time to repeat the test.

22:04.058 --> 22:06.584
So the two corpses were found
in the same kind of soil?

22:07.046 --> 22:08.425
That's what I just said.

22:08.545 --> 22:10.606
Katherine, do you know what this means?

22:10.783 --> 22:12.949
Yes. We can work out a timeline

22:12.973 --> 22:14.691
for when the first body was buried.

22:14.725 --> 22:15.969
What are you talking about?

22:16.089 --> 22:18.727
I can find out from Doctor
Ogden when her subject died

22:18.781 --> 22:20.528
and the exact date she buried it.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.804
That will give us a baseline

22:22.813 --> 22:25.295
to calculate the rate of
decomposition in clay soil.

22:25.315 --> 22:27.950
And we may be able to find out
when the first victim was murdered.

22:32.505 --> 22:34.796
We have covered the
property several times over

22:34.835 --> 22:37.046
and I've dug up every indentation

22:37.081 --> 22:40.278
and unusual piece of
vegetation we have come across.

22:40.456 --> 22:42.287
Perhaps there's a body in the river.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.769
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I don't think there are

22:46.789 --> 22:48.758
any more bodies to be found.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.837
You know, I really think
forensic work could be my calling.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.794
That would be a terrible waste,
if you don't mind my saying.

22:56.535 --> 22:58.779
You don't think I would be good at it?

22:58.819 --> 23:04.049
No, no, I think given your
determination and thoroughness,

23:04.074 --> 23:05.431
I think you'd be quite excellent.

23:05.648 --> 23:08.012
But you have a special way
of dealing with the living.

23:09.172 --> 23:10.529
How do you mean?

23:10.603 --> 23:12.700
You talk to people like they're people.

23:13.006 --> 23:15.011
That's a rare thing for doctor.

23:16.042 --> 23:19.678
Well, I will take that as
a compliment, Constable.

23:21.514 --> 23:24.456
My name's Augustus. But I prefer Gus.

23:26.307 --> 23:28.177
So, Gus,

23:28.547 --> 23:30.437
you sure there are no more bodies?

23:32.732 --> 23:33.906
Quite sure.

23:35.935 --> 23:37.335
Well George,

23:37.508 --> 23:39.127
you really are a dark horse.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.422
I had no idea you had such
an entrepreneurial streak.

23:41.496 --> 23:43.120
Oh, it's really just a sideline.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.680
No, it's a stroke of
genius on your part.

23:45.705 --> 23:47.260
No one knows how to fix autos.

23:47.492 --> 23:48.888
Well, Sam's the brains really,

23:48.903 --> 23:50.753
I'm just more of a silent partner.

23:50.873 --> 23:52.743
Don't be so modest, George.

23:53.468 --> 23:55.181
Bloom and Crabtree...

23:55.487 --> 23:57.827
Crabtree and Bloom has
more of a ring to it.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.490
It's funny you should say that.

23:59.610 --> 24:01.069
What do you think, Samuel?

24:03.729 --> 24:06.566
- How much is the seller asking?
- One hundred dollars.

24:08.308 --> 24:09.745
Have I been handed a lemon?

24:09.865 --> 24:11.477
You found yourself a steal.

24:11.597 --> 24:12.923
It runs like a top.

24:13.313 --> 24:15.060
If you don't buy it,
I'll snap it up myself.

24:15.253 --> 24:18.026
- Excellent. Thank you, Samuel.
- My pleasure.

24:18.146 --> 24:20.927
I'm just glad you brought this
beaut by for me to take a look at.

24:21.581 --> 24:23.245
Is he always so forward
with his customers?

24:23.250 --> 24:25.717
I think he was actually
talking about the automobile.

24:27.296 --> 24:28.940
Shop talk, I get it.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.800
The secret language of mechanics.

24:31.190 --> 24:32.551
You know, I believe this garage

24:32.562 --> 24:34.087
could be the making of you, George.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.314
It seems likely the Hobbins family

24:38.322 --> 24:40.208
buried their victims on our property.

24:40.448 --> 24:43.315
Where we are building
our home. How charming!

24:44.036 --> 24:46.360
Though there is some irony
to it, don't you think?

24:46.606 --> 24:48.492
That a detective and the city coroner

24:48.502 --> 24:52.268
should buy land that's being used
as a disposal site for bodies?

24:52.524 --> 24:54.814
Ironic for us, yes.

24:54.864 --> 24:57.479
And unfortunate for the perpetrators,

24:57.883 --> 25:00.055
albeit ones already in jail.

25:00.104 --> 25:02.765
Yes. And when I meet
them, I intend to find out

25:02.785 --> 25:04.368
just who their victims were.

25:04.541 --> 25:07.201
But there's something wrong
with the timeline, William.

25:08.365 --> 25:11.539
- Of course.
- If the Hobbins are securely behind bars

25:11.564 --> 25:14.787
- at Kingston Penitentiary...
- Then how did they bury their last victim

25:14.792 --> 25:17.160
only a few months ago?

25:34.769 --> 25:37.536
- Mr. Bruce.
- What do you want now?

25:37.857 --> 25:39.758
- Still miss your wife...
- I Didn't.

25:39.792 --> 25:42.630
- Until you brought her up again.
- Sorry for that.

25:45.517 --> 25:47.768
Now all I want is for her to come back.

25:50.596 --> 25:52.141
Do you believe she's alive?

25:52.627 --> 25:53.671
I don't know.

25:54.017 --> 25:55.877
That's what I'm trying to find out.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.643
She was seen with two
other missing women.

25:59.763 --> 26:01.040
So far, I have had little luck

26:01.055 --> 26:03.019
ascertaining any of their whereabouts.

26:03.848 --> 26:05.768
Likely mouldering in a grave somewhere.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.887
Likely, but not definitely.

26:10.423 --> 26:11.533
Mr. Bruce,

26:11.557 --> 26:13.747
are you still in possession
of your wife's belongings?

26:14.172 --> 26:15.882
I haven't thrown out a thing.

26:16.384 --> 26:17.983
I haven't had the heart.

26:18.259 --> 26:19.503
Can I take a look?

26:20.218 --> 26:21.541
I suppose so.

26:24.358 --> 26:25.987
I miss her something terrible.

26:40.675 --> 26:43.442
- George, what brings you here?
- Sir, I hate to bother you at home,

26:43.477 --> 26:45.579
but there's no point in
your traveling to Kingston.

26:45.699 --> 26:47.139
What do you mean?

26:47.183 --> 26:50.100
The Hobbins are not incarcerated
in Kingston Penitentiary.

26:50.149 --> 26:51.402
I spoke to the Warden there.

26:51.432 --> 26:54.586
What's more, there's no record
of them ever having been there.

26:55.183 --> 26:56.618
Were they sent to a different prison?

26:56.673 --> 26:58.207
Sir, there are no inmates by that name

26:58.242 --> 26:59.816
in any prison in the province.

27:02.813 --> 27:05.236
But George, there is a
record of their conviction.

27:05.261 --> 27:08.207
I know sir, I don't
understand myself, unless...

27:08.947 --> 27:11.538
they escaped before being transported.

27:11.972 --> 27:13.907
Well, if that were the case,

27:13.941 --> 27:15.742
we surely would have heard about it.

27:15.776 --> 27:17.520
Yes, surely we would have.

27:18.423 --> 27:22.129
So, you're telling me we have a
family of criminals on the loose.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.637
Perhaps with plans on burying
more bodies on your land, sir.

27:30.678 --> 27:31.995
I believe Miss James and I

27:32.004 --> 27:34.067
have gleaned all that
we can from the bodies.

27:34.146 --> 27:35.350
Are we interrupting?

27:35.365 --> 27:37.516
We have the results of the soil testing.

27:37.636 --> 27:39.249
Not at all. What have you?

27:39.594 --> 27:42.905
We measured water retention
in the soil from each grave.

27:43.025 --> 27:45.340
The more water retained,
the wetter the soil.

27:45.392 --> 27:48.378
Creating an opportunistic
environment for tissue decomposition.

27:48.630 --> 27:50.007
As I've learned from Miss Roy.

27:50.026 --> 27:52.030
We discovered three
distinct environments.

27:52.059 --> 27:54.206
The first body was found in clay soil.

27:54.221 --> 27:57.182
Now, clay holds water unless
there's very good drainage,

27:57.192 --> 27:59.067
which there was at
the first burial site.

27:59.082 --> 28:02.274
And the skeletal body was
buried in very moist soil.

28:02.324 --> 28:05.112
A cubic foot of that soil
retained two gallons of water.

28:05.136 --> 28:08.832
But the third body, however,
was in sandy soil and subsoil.

28:08.842 --> 28:10.792
Much drier conditions.

28:10.827 --> 28:14.113
And the grave was on higher
ground and in full sun.

28:14.281 --> 28:16.088
It was also wrapped in a blanket.

28:16.354 --> 28:17.899
Dramatically different conditions.

28:17.908 --> 28:20.662
Yes, and ones that could
substantially effect decomposition.

28:20.687 --> 28:22.976
Good work! Thank you.

28:23.957 --> 28:26.786
The body found in the wet conditions
would have decomposed faster

28:26.827 --> 28:28.704
than the one in the
hot, dry environment.

28:30.255 --> 28:32.654
Hot and dry would have
slowed the process.

28:32.699 --> 28:35.179
These victims could have been
killed within a much smaller

28:35.198 --> 28:36.631
window than we first thought.

28:36.785 --> 28:39.015
Have you been able to
establish their ages?

28:39.623 --> 28:41.585
Yes, we examined the teeth.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.569
Judging from the condition of the
enamel and the remaining molars,

28:44.652 --> 28:46.488
the skeleton was that of an older man

28:46.496 --> 28:48.939
and the other victims were
likely in their thirties.

28:48.967 --> 28:49.910
Hm!

28:50.913 --> 28:53.897
I believe the Hobbins family
remains at the centre of this...

28:54.351 --> 28:55.516
mystery.

28:56.692 --> 28:59.665
But perhaps in a different
way than we first thought.

29:06.235 --> 29:07.317
You again.

29:08.667 --> 29:09.958
You recognize these?

29:10.412 --> 29:12.086
Pair of old boots, it looks like.

29:12.153 --> 29:14.411
Yes. Did they belong to your father?

29:15.071 --> 29:17.522
If you say so, I suppose they do.

29:17.642 --> 29:19.725
Where are your father and brothers now?

29:19.994 --> 29:21.790
Last time I saw them they
were getting hauled off

29:21.818 --> 29:23.065
to the Kingston prison.

29:23.468 --> 29:25.099
Did you ever visit them there?

29:25.219 --> 29:27.582
Why would I do that?

29:28.001 --> 29:29.923
Miss Hobbins, I am sorry to say this

29:29.947 --> 29:32.505
but I believe your father
and brothers are dead.

29:34.901 --> 29:36.477
He die with those on or off?

29:40.962 --> 29:44.626
George, the warden you spoke
with at Kingston Penitentiary,

29:44.684 --> 29:46.820
- how long had he been there?
- Not that long, sir.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.596
The previous warden had just retired.

29:48.900 --> 29:51.233
That's who we need to
speak with. Find him.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.363
Right.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.376
Everything in here is Muriel's.

30:00.441 --> 30:01.562
You kept it.

30:02.288 --> 30:04.498
For when she came back.

30:07.159 --> 30:09.749
- Tried getting rid of it a number of times...
- And you never could.

30:09.911 --> 30:11.083
Good to have faith.

30:13.294 --> 30:16.176
I went to the police a couple of
days after she disappeared, you know.

30:16.322 --> 30:17.678
They never did anything.

30:17.856 --> 30:19.778
Said it was my fault she ran off.

30:22.245 --> 30:24.685
Aside from her blonde hair,
anything you can tell me

30:24.720 --> 30:26.019
to help identify her?

30:26.232 --> 30:28.997
- You think she might be dead.
- I... don't know.

30:30.591 --> 30:32.417
Well, uh,

30:32.486 --> 30:34.993
she has a birthmark on her right calf.

30:35.564 --> 30:37.416
Shaped like an hourglass.

30:40.564 --> 30:43.070
- What do you know about this?
- It's her book.

30:43.653 --> 30:45.084
She wasn't much of a reader.

30:45.553 --> 30:48.030
Would take her a couple
hours to get through a page!

30:48.252 --> 30:49.348
But...

30:49.578 --> 30:51.228
last few days I was with her,

30:51.348 --> 30:52.910
she was never without it.

30:53.962 --> 30:55.748
What can you tell me
about your wife's cousin?

30:55.782 --> 30:57.509
Caroline McGovern, isn't it?

30:59.982 --> 31:02.104
Well, not much.

31:02.775 --> 31:05.073
Last I heard she was
working in some tavern.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.621
May I keep this?

31:09.516 --> 31:12.576
How much did the Hobbins
offer you to let them go?

31:13.529 --> 31:15.222
Enough to retire on?

31:15.596 --> 31:17.807
Where did you get that idea?

31:18.448 --> 31:20.867
You were the warden at
Kingston Penitentiary

31:20.896 --> 31:24.287
when William, Patrick, and
Daniel Hobbins were sent there.

31:24.725 --> 31:27.153
Yet, there's no record
of them whatsoever.

31:27.197 --> 31:30.296
You were the only person who
had access to those records.

31:30.416 --> 31:33.361
- You made a deal to let them go.
- You're wrong.

31:33.688 --> 31:36.272
I had as little to do
with them as I could.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.898
Then who did you take money from?

31:39.728 --> 31:40.995
Money?

31:41.474 --> 31:44.973
How dare you sugg... I wouldn't
take a penny from that poor man.

31:45.994 --> 31:47.301
From who?

31:50.308 --> 31:51.922
Alvin Nash.

31:52.267 --> 31:55.109
Alvin Nash... the neighbour?

31:56.166 --> 31:58.307
- What does he have to...
- I was happy to help any way I could

31:58.312 --> 31:59.818
after what he told me.

32:01.426 --> 32:03.537
I'm afraid I don't follow, sir.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.461
Did you not know what they did?

32:05.866 --> 32:08.334
Those Hobbins burned down Nash's barn

32:08.359 --> 32:10.476
in revenge over some old land dispute.

32:11.117 --> 32:13.426
Nash's boy was killed in the fire.

32:13.677 --> 32:16.311
Fourteen years old, he was. Still a lad.

32:16.772 --> 32:19.487
His wife was so grieved
it drove her mad.

32:20.754 --> 32:23.237
But how did you know Alvin Nash?

32:23.306 --> 32:26.372
We were both in a
sanitarium near Peterborough.

32:26.609 --> 32:27.580
When?

32:28.493 --> 32:29.924
Two years ago.

32:30.547 --> 32:34.016
We got talking and he learned
I was the warden at Kingston.

32:35.842 --> 32:37.895
Terrible thing, losing a son.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.164
- Surely there was an investigation?
- Ha!

32:42.218 --> 32:43.477
Of sorts.

32:43.597 --> 32:45.549
But those Hobbins
covered for each other,

32:45.588 --> 32:47.074
said they were nowhere near the place.

32:47.814 --> 32:49.793
Nash got no satisfaction
from the courts.

32:49.807 --> 32:52.053
They got away scot-free,
can you believe that?

32:52.773 --> 32:54.451
It was eating him up inside.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.682
After many years, he finally found a way

32:56.691 --> 32:58.853
to get justice the only way he could.

32:59.534 --> 33:02.278
So you had the Hobbins
released to Mr. Nash.

33:02.895 --> 33:03.878
How?

33:04.139 --> 33:07.095
I told them they were part
of a special work detail.

33:07.658 --> 33:09.686
I escorted them out of the prison.

33:09.725 --> 33:12.523
Nash's wagon was waiting
for them outside the gates.

33:12.988 --> 33:15.188
They climbed in, never
suspected a thing.

33:15.891 --> 33:17.571
That's was the last I saw of them.

33:22.535 --> 33:24.638
I will be charging you, sir.

33:30.485 --> 33:33.638
Go ahead. I'll never see the courts.

33:34.276 --> 33:35.559
I'm dying.

33:36.541 --> 33:38.860
So it doesn't matter to me what you do.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.897
I know I ended my life
doing one good thing.

33:53.541 --> 33:54.903
Mr. Nash...

33:55.717 --> 33:58.605
the Hobbins were neighbours
of yours for many years.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.110
They were.

34:00.623 --> 34:03.106
And there were disputes
between the families

34:03.121 --> 34:06.496
going back all the way to your
fathers' days, is that correct?

34:07.364 --> 34:08.514
Yes.

34:08.983 --> 34:10.952
They were liars and thieves.

34:12.462 --> 34:16.132
What do you know of William,
Daniel and Patrick Hobbins' deaths?

34:16.253 --> 34:17.333
What about them?

34:17.752 --> 34:21.029
Theirs are the bodies that
were buried on my land.

34:21.927 --> 34:24.414
But then, you already
knew that, didn't you?

34:25.899 --> 34:28.840
I spoke with Warden Smith.
He told me what happened.

34:29.030 --> 34:30.449
Whatever he did,

34:31.234 --> 34:33.193
the burden should be on me, not him.

34:33.313 --> 34:35.418
That will be for the courts to decide.

34:35.962 --> 34:39.628
The Hobbins were vile,
terrible human beings.

34:41.281 --> 34:42.976
Yes, I got them out.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.960
- Why?
- So I could kill them.

34:46.636 --> 34:47.775
It had to be done.

34:47.846 --> 34:50.351
But they were locked up! Behind bars...

34:50.708 --> 34:52.627
No danger to you.

34:52.667 --> 34:54.083
For two lousy years.

34:54.286 --> 34:57.627
Then, they'd be released and back
to making our lives a living hell.

34:58.219 --> 35:00.652
It was my chance to be
rid of them for good.

35:01.580 --> 35:04.230
So you took the law into your own hands.

35:05.587 --> 35:06.861
The law?

35:09.047 --> 35:10.952
What did the law do for my boy?

35:12.279 --> 35:14.672
He was burned alive by those animals.

35:15.659 --> 35:18.225
My wife went into a grief
she'll never come out of.

35:19.592 --> 35:21.902
Somebody had to stop them.

35:23.881 --> 35:26.107
And it wasn't just the
Nashs they picked on, either.

35:26.121 --> 35:28.391
- They were bullies to the whole county.
- How so?

35:29.674 --> 35:30.977
Frank's hand...

35:31.209 --> 35:33.441
wasn't injured in any farming accident.

35:34.254 --> 35:36.163
The Hobbins boys crushed it.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.326
Punishment for some...

35:38.662 --> 35:40.117
supposed theft.

35:41.164 --> 35:43.192
They crippled Barry's horse...

35:43.671 --> 35:45.088
just for the fun of it.

35:46.001 --> 35:47.298
He had to shoot her.

35:48.483 --> 35:51.212
So you killed them to avenge
your neighbours, as well.

35:55.412 --> 35:57.627
They got what they deserved,
it's all I'm saying.

35:59.774 --> 36:01.455
And where are the murder weapons?

36:01.910 --> 36:03.578
The pitchfork's in my barn.

36:04.116 --> 36:05.799
And what of the other weapons?

36:06.085 --> 36:07.793
I used Frank's hammer...

36:08.380 --> 36:09.826
and Barry's rifle.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.907
Poetic justice for the
injuries they suffered.

36:14.235 --> 36:16.853
The bodies were buried
in three different graves.

36:16.912 --> 36:18.614
Why not just one?

36:20.247 --> 36:21.600
Took my time.

36:22.232 --> 36:23.470
Locked them up...

36:24.023 --> 36:25.543
killed them one by one.

36:27.961 --> 36:30.508
I'll be needing that
pitchfork, Mr. Nash.

36:32.285 --> 36:33.824
Just let it be.

36:34.653 --> 36:36.488
We're all better off without them.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.127
You murdered and buried
three men, Mr. Nash.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.633
You're in no position to judge.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.425
There's no question,
the pitchfork matches

36:45.440 --> 36:46.965
the wounds on the third body.

36:47.543 --> 36:50.420
Then, Mr. Nash's
confession closes the case.

36:51.288 --> 36:52.542
Still...

36:53.007 --> 36:54.086
Something wrong?

36:54.816 --> 36:57.506
The Hobbins were a
family of violent thugs.

36:57.738 --> 37:01.523
Mr. Nash is an older man barely
able to tend to his own farm.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.741
Where did he find the
strength to kill and bury

37:04.755 --> 37:06.133
three grown men?

37:06.335 --> 37:08.472
Revenge is a mighty fuel.

37:09.290 --> 37:11.843
Doctor Ogden, Detective.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.646
Miss Roy and I have
done some calculations

37:14.665 --> 37:16.289
based on the rate of decomposition

37:16.328 --> 37:18.440
of the two corpses we
found buried in clay.

37:18.733 --> 37:21.668
- Our baseline was the body you buried...
- Six months ago.

37:21.703 --> 37:25.024
Yes. So, accounting for
some physical differences

37:25.144 --> 37:26.633
which might affect the results,

37:26.668 --> 37:29.135
we have determined the body
was buried two years ago.

37:29.643 --> 37:31.449
That's excellent work, Miss James.

37:31.454 --> 37:33.966
That gives you your timeline
for the Hobbins murders.

37:34.642 --> 37:37.031
Two years ago. Are you sure?

37:39.602 --> 37:41.768
It's actually quite a
conservative estimate.

37:41.931 --> 37:44.670
It could be two years
and three months. Why?

37:45.425 --> 37:47.575
Well, Alvin Nash should
thank you, Miss James.

37:47.853 --> 37:49.852
You've just handed him an alibi.

37:54.536 --> 37:56.071
Watch your step, old man.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.671
Get your hands off me, sonny boy.

38:03.049 --> 38:05.512
Is it common practice to
let murderers out of jail?

38:05.936 --> 38:08.197
You're no murderer, Mr. Nash.

38:08.317 --> 38:09.677
Don't be ridiculous.

38:09.717 --> 38:12.096
You may have persuaded
the Warden to release

38:12.106 --> 38:14.924
the Hobbins men to you,
but you didn't kill them.

38:15.516 --> 38:16.794
Of course I did.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.530
You were in a sanitarium in
Peterborough two years ago.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.946
You're wrong!

38:23.451 --> 38:26.437
I stuck that pitchfork in
Patrick Hobbins as sure as day.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.875
Then, I took care of the other two.

38:29.156 --> 38:31.811
The pitchfork was used
for one of the murders...

38:32.440 --> 38:34.288
but it wasn't in your hands.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.577
Who are you protecting?

38:37.096 --> 38:38.833
Who is the real killer?

38:39.494 --> 38:40.935
Leave him be.

38:41.783 --> 38:44.133
What do you know about
the Hobbins men, Miss Nash?

38:44.163 --> 38:45.446
She doesn't know anything.

38:46.013 --> 38:48.658
Miss Nash, you have
something you'd like to say?

38:48.923 --> 38:50.939
You don't know what they did to us.

38:51.314 --> 38:53.675
Horrible things I'm
not putting a name to.

38:53.693 --> 38:56.644
- Hush, Dorothy!
- No, I'm not staying quiet.

38:57.172 --> 38:58.371
Look at her.

38:58.899 --> 39:01.855
Look at my mother. She's hardly human.

39:02.156 --> 39:03.977
And my brother...

39:04.021 --> 39:05.404
after what they did to him,

39:05.719 --> 39:07.995
there wasn't even a
body left for us to bury.

39:08.064 --> 39:09.495
Just ashes.

39:09.525 --> 39:11.557
ashes!

39:11.558 --> 39:12.920
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

39:13.162 --> 39:15.249
I'm not ashamed of what we did.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.233
Who else, Miss Nash?

39:20.470 --> 39:21.684
Gentlemen.

39:23.124 --> 39:25.583
- What's going here, Alvin?
- Just business...

39:25.613 --> 39:27.020
between me and the Detective.

39:27.140 --> 39:28.738
Nothing to get involved in.

39:29.297 --> 39:32.088
You have a question for Alvin,
you have a question for all of us.

39:35.256 --> 39:37.743
- Severe blows to the hands.
- Frank's hand

39:37.812 --> 39:40.373
wasn't injured in any farming...
Hobbins boys crushed it.

39:40.373 --> 39:43.279
His left femur was broken in
two places, likely pre-mortem.

39:43.304 --> 39:45.771
They crippled Barry's
horse, just for fun.

39:49.651 --> 39:52.538
Three killers from
three wronged families...

39:52.973 --> 39:55.840
exacting the same injuries.

39:56.170 --> 39:57.754
I should've done that.

39:58.243 --> 40:01.464
I should've set Patrick Hobbins on fire.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.400
The pitchfork was too quick.

40:08.345 --> 40:10.492
You deny this, Mr. Walsh?

40:12.041 --> 40:15.475
No one misses them. Not
even their girl, Minnie.

40:15.791 --> 40:18.708
They would've terrorized us
'til we were all crazy or dead.

40:19.109 --> 40:21.355
No court will punish us

40:21.416 --> 40:23.149
for doing what we did.

40:23.269 --> 40:25.025
We did the right thing.

40:39.799 --> 40:42.531
Welcome to the neighbourhood, Detective.

41:01.353 --> 41:05.195
Police constable runs
auto garage you can trust.

41:06.222 --> 41:07.661
Hm!

41:07.781 --> 41:09.068
What do you think?

41:09.555 --> 41:10.949
Well, it's...

41:11.069 --> 41:12.380
It's very well written.

41:12.405 --> 41:15.058
The publicity is sure
to attract new customers.

41:16.070 --> 41:17.396
What is it?

41:18.334 --> 41:20.148
It's not entirely true, is it?

41:20.216 --> 41:22.806
I mean, I don't run the garage.

41:23.084 --> 41:26.001
- Of course you do.
- But I don't, Louise. As I said, I'm a...

41:26.038 --> 41:27.551
I'm a silent partner.

41:27.595 --> 41:30.191
So you think Mr. Bloom could
have pulled it off on his own?

41:31.326 --> 41:32.821
No. Probably not.

41:32.941 --> 41:36.774
George, it's a good idea for you
to be the face of the business.

41:36.852 --> 41:39.543
Everyone trusts a police
constable to be honest.

41:39.711 --> 41:41.384
There will be autos
lined up around the block.

41:41.394 --> 41:42.874
You could even start another shop.

41:42.939 --> 41:45.534
I don't know what my bosses
will think about this.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.607
Perhaps if it takes
off, it won't matter.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.852
How do you mean?

41:50.415 --> 41:52.418
In a year from now you might
not even be a Constable.

41:52.428 --> 41:54.639
You could be running a
string of auto garages.

41:54.689 --> 41:56.253
Crabtree and Bloom's.

41:56.282 --> 41:58.306
Do you think so?

41:58.360 --> 42:01.271
Certainly, George, if you would
just stop hiding your talent.

42:02.964 --> 42:04.350
Perhaps you're right.

42:04.952 --> 42:06.493
And you're sure there
are no more bodies?

42:06.542 --> 42:09.738
Uh-huh! I believe Miss
Baxter and Constable Jackson

42:09.743 --> 42:11.303
searched quite thoroughly.

42:11.999 --> 42:14.156
Wouldn't want the builders
to find anything untoward.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.759
They start again tomorrow.

42:16.085 --> 42:19.135
It's hard to believe this is the
same idyllic setting you chose.

42:19.175 --> 42:22.398
Given that we found murdered
victims buried on it.

42:22.639 --> 42:24.958
And we arrested all our neighbours.

42:25.782 --> 42:27.949
I don't think that we should live here.

42:28.014 --> 42:29.657
I couldn't agree with you more.

42:29.657 --> 42:32.825
- I'm so relieved to hear you say that!
- I'll put it on the market tomorrow.

42:35.462 --> 42:36.620
Hello?

42:38.658 --> 42:40.810
- Uh...
- Doctor Ogden!

42:40.930 --> 42:42.704
Miss Baxter!

42:42.778 --> 42:45.413
Doing some final research, I take it.

42:45.478 --> 42:47.586
- Yes!
- Uh, Sir, we, uh...

42:47.610 --> 42:50.675
we were inspecting... behind...

42:51.489 --> 42:53.355
- and um...
- Constable Jackson,

42:53.384 --> 42:56.305
I believe you may be needed
down at the station house.

42:56.488 --> 42:58.230
- Yes. Going.
- Hm. Sir.

42:58.255 --> 43:00.169
With your clothes on.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.168
Uh, ah...

43:02.647 --> 43:04.837
Um, eh... Hm.

43:08.228 --> 43:11.372
I suppose a tent is a
rather romantic place.

43:12.034 --> 43:14.274
Even if it served as a morgue?

43:14.664 --> 43:16.460
The dead will never tell.

43:21.355 --> 43:22.796
On the next Murdoch.

43:22.827 --> 43:25.457
Just one dose of Pendramine.

43:25.492 --> 43:27.664
- I'm a young man again.
- Eternal youth,

43:27.708 --> 43:29.071
is it worth going to jail?

43:29.083 --> 43:30.805
Even the wealthiest company in the world

43:30.824 --> 43:33.232
- could not pay your price.
- Detective Murdoch lied to me.

43:33.269 --> 43:34.516
On an all new Murdoch Mysteries,

43:34.522 --> 43:36.576
next Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
