<i>Previously on "The Path"...</i>

00:02.143 --> 00:03.303
<i>Cal's in charge.</i>

00:03.305 --> 00:05.295
<i>He's watching over us
while our founder,</i>

00:05.297 --> 00:08.167
<i>the Guardian of The Light, Dr.
Steven Meyer, he's in Peru</i>

00:08.170 --> 00:10.280
<i>transcribing the last three
rungs of The Ladder.</i>

00:10.282 --> 00:12.233
Everyone has pain, Mary.

00:12.235 --> 00:14.255
We just try not to carry it with us.

00:14.257 --> 00:17.197
My dad started selling me to
his friends when I was 11.

00:17.199 --> 00:19.230
Where the fuck have you been?

00:19.232 --> 00:21.202
That's my dad.

00:21.204 --> 00:23.134
Ooh!

00:23.136 --> 00:27.199
Ever since he got back from
Peru, he's been distant.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.261
<i>Hello? No, you don't
need to know my name.</i>

00:29.263 --> 00:31.183
<i>What's your name?</i>

00:31.185 --> 00:33.325
You tell me something so I
know that this isn't a trap.

00:33.327 --> 00:36.238
Do you have to get that?

00:36.240 --> 00:38.170
<i>You having an affair, Eddie?</i>

00:38.172 --> 00:40.332
No. Look, this whole thing
is just a big mix-up.

00:40.334 --> 00:42.284
Who'd you meet at the motel last night?

00:42.286 --> 00:46.229
Was the vision of my brother...
was it real?

00:46.231 --> 00:49.151
<i>I mean, am I going to blow up my life</i>

00:49.153 --> 00:53.196
because of something I don't
even know if I really saw?

00:53.198 --> 00:55.250
I guess so.

<i>Do you see The Light?</i>

01:37.335 --> 01:40.196
<i>Yes.</i>

01:40.198 --> 01:43.269
<i>- Is Eddie with you?
- No.</i>

01:43.271 --> 01:45.351
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

01:45.353 --> 01:47.284
<i>I'm with you.</i>

01:47.286 --> 01:48.395
<i>I am.</i>

01:48.397 --> 01:50.367
<i>I see you.</i>

01:50.369 --> 01:53.450
<i>Take his hand.</i>

01:53.452 --> 01:57.244
<i>Now, I want you to lead him.</i>

01:57.246 --> 02:00.377
<i>Lead him to The Truth.</i>

02:00.379 --> 02:03.391
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

02:03.393 --> 02:07.385
<i>Back in time.</i>

02:07.387 --> 02:09.387
<i>Here.</i>

02:09.389 --> 02:12.351
<i>This is where I want to take you.</i>

02:25.466 --> 02:29.318
<i>I lost something. I admit it.</i>

02:29.320 --> 02:33.274
<i>I stopped wanting you like that.</i>

02:36.388 --> 02:40.270
I take responsibility. I do.

02:40.272 --> 02:41.361
That's good, Sarah.

02:41.363 --> 02:44.355
Sarah accepts her responsibility.

02:44.357 --> 02:46.499
It's your turn.

02:48.510 --> 02:50.312
Okay.

02:53.316 --> 02:58.379
I take responsibility
too, but it's over.

02:58.381 --> 03:00.322
It is done.

03:00.324 --> 03:02.323
I regret it.

03:02.325 --> 03:05.376
I just want to move forward.

03:05.378 --> 03:10.452
We can't move forward until
you reveal everything,

03:10.454 --> 03:13.365
because you're still
protecting Miranda Frank.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.418
It is not Miranda Frank.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.360
The Eye sees.

03:17.362 --> 03:18.511
The Eye knows.

03:18.513 --> 03:22.364
Infidelity is a great affront
to The Truth, Eddie.

03:22.366 --> 03:24.307
I made a mistake.

03:24.309 --> 03:29.492
A horrible, terrible mistake,
but people make mistakes.

03:29.494 --> 03:32.436
I don't.

03:32.438 --> 03:36.502
I'm going to recommend
14 days in-house, Eddie.

03:41.397 --> 03:43.377
Why wasn't I enough?

03:43.379 --> 03:45.419
You were.

03:45.421 --> 03:47.502
Are.

03:47.504 --> 03:49.506
Enough.

03:51.568 --> 03:55.420
I just want our life back.

03:55.422 --> 03:59.514
Then do the 14 days.

03:59.516 --> 04:03.381
If you really love us, you will.

04:14.542 --> 04:18.384
I love you.

04:18.386 --> 04:21.428
I love the kids

04:21.430 --> 04:25.512
more than anything,

04:25.514 --> 04:31.448
but I won't do 14 days in here.

04:31.450 --> 04:32.501
I won't.

04:36.506 --> 04:38.606
<i>Stay true to your message.</i>

04:38.608 --> 04:40.458
<i>Be positive.</i>

04:40.460 --> 04:42.620
<i>Relate to your audience.</i>

04:42.622 --> 04:45.493
<i>Now, let's talk about
non-verbal techniques</i>

04:45.495 --> 04:48.606
<i>we can use to further
enhance this connection.</i>

04:48.608 --> 04:52.481
<i>Did you know you can use
your eyes to speak volumes?</i>

04:52.483 --> 04:53.632
<i>Try it.</i>

04:53.634 --> 04:57.638
<i>Use your eyes to convey
that you are serious.</i>

05:00.622 --> 05:03.632
<i>Entertained.</i>

05:03.634 --> 05:07.639
<i>Use your eyes to communicate
a sea of empathy.</i>

05:11.513 --> 05:13.503
<i>And don't forget to smile.</i>

05:13.505 --> 05:16.527
<i>However, studies show that
people don't react well to men</i>

05:16.529 --> 05:18.638
<i>who smile too much.</i>

05:18.640 --> 05:20.530
<i>But a well-placed smile</i>

05:20.532 --> 05:23.584
<i>can be just what you
need to seal the deal.</i>

05:23.586 --> 05:25.536
<i>Now, let's talk about...</i>

05:58.703 --> 06:00.563
Cal Roberts.

06:00.565 --> 06:01.664
Thank so much for coming.

06:01.666 --> 06:03.617
Glad I can be of service.

06:03.619 --> 06:06.610
I have lunch on the veranda.

06:06.612 --> 06:08.511
You eat lobster?

06:08.513 --> 06:09.602
No.

06:09.604 --> 06:12.578
Well, there are other options.

06:15.581 --> 06:18.632
Is that what I think it is?

06:18.634 --> 06:20.695
It is.

06:20.697 --> 06:21.786
What is it you do exactly?

06:21.788 --> 06:24.679
I operate a hedge fund.

06:24.681 --> 06:26.610
Wow, Modigliani.

06:26.612 --> 06:28.555
You like art?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.578
No.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.712
There was a time I used art

06:36.714 --> 06:40.676
to deepen my understanding
of the human condition,

06:40.678 --> 06:43.729
so Francis Bacon revealed a depth

06:43.731 --> 06:46.612
of suffering that I
couldn't comprehend,

06:46.614 --> 06:48.544
or a Dylan ballad

06:48.546 --> 06:51.578
helped me get inside what
it meant to live as so many

06:51.580 --> 06:55.742
in an existential drift.

06:55.744 --> 06:59.646
Now that's the only art I need.

06:59.648 --> 07:04.691
The rest is a distraction.

07:04.693 --> 07:07.665
My wife insisted we
hang that thing there.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.667
I tell the guests it's a Dali.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.657
Please, have a seat.

07:28.659 --> 07:29.688
- Kerry?
- Split step...

07:29.690 --> 07:31.620
Excuse me.

07:31.622 --> 07:32.713
I'm starving.

07:34.715 --> 07:35.716
Hi.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.781
Thank you so much for coming.

07:41.783 --> 07:43.713
You know, I can't begin

07:43.715 --> 07:45.805
to tell you how thankful
I am for the movement.

07:45.807 --> 07:48.728
It got me through so much.

07:48.730 --> 07:51.621
Sit down, please.

07:51.623 --> 07:53.623
How long have you been a
follower, Mrs. Ridge?

07:53.625 --> 07:55.606
Oh, Kerry, please.

07:55.608 --> 07:57.618
Ten years, right, babe?
Wouldn't you say?

07:57.620 --> 07:59.730
Your mom died in '04, so yeah.

07:59.732 --> 08:00.801
Yeah, about ten years.

08:00.803 --> 08:03.634
It's been hell. Not my mother.

08:03.636 --> 08:06.727
That was hard, but nothing like this.

08:06.729 --> 08:07.738
It's our son.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.710
He's been in five rehabs.

08:09.712 --> 08:11.743
- He's not our son anymore.
- Don't say that.

08:11.745 --> 08:14.826
He's lied to us. Stolen from us.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.729
And it's not like we
did anything wrong.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.682
He had everything. Everything.

08:19.684 --> 08:22.764
We want him to do your rehab program.

08:22.766 --> 08:25.707
I met a woman in a Toward
the Light workshop,

08:25.709 --> 08:28.711
and she said it changed her life.

08:28.713 --> 08:33.655
It's... It's really our last hope.

08:33.658 --> 08:34.929
We can definitely help your son.

08:37.682 --> 08:40.673
I just want to be discreet.

08:40.674 --> 08:41.854
Let's be honest.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.870
It's a little cultish for
me to be associated with.

08:48.684 --> 08:50.664
I'm prepared to make a
very large donation

08:50.666 --> 08:52.729
for your help in this matter.

08:57.843 --> 09:00.875
Hey, again.

09:00.877 --> 09:01.956
Hi.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.709
What are you studying?

09:04.711 --> 09:07.713
I have a calc exam fifth period.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.745
Oh, sorry. Am I bothering you?

09:09.747 --> 09:10.966
It's okay.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.958
My mom and I were at the
supermarket this morning,

09:12.960 --> 09:14.879
and we heard someone say
that you guys, like,

09:14.881 --> 09:16.822
brought people into your house

09:16.824 --> 09:18.894
from the tornado to, like, help them.

09:18.896 --> 09:20.716
Is that true?

09:20.718 --> 09:21.877
Yeah.

09:21.879 --> 09:23.890
I think it's really great
that you did that.

09:23.892 --> 09:26.873
Cool.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.917
Will you come to my house?

09:30.918 --> 09:33.730
What?

09:33.732 --> 09:35.804
I want to show you something.

09:37.806 --> 09:41.889
I'm not really supposed to
hang out with girls like you,

09:41.891 --> 09:44.922
like, alone.

09:44.924 --> 09:47.835
Right, you can only hang out
with girls in your cult?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.927
- We're not a cult.
- Yeah, religion.

09:49.929 --> 09:52.932
Whatever. It's-movement, yeah, no.

09:54.774 --> 09:56.795
Like, how we are right now is fine,

09:56.797 --> 10:00.951
but at your house... not really.

10:03.784 --> 10:06.805
I just really need someone to
see what's happening there,

10:06.807 --> 10:12.742
and I don't really know
who else to go to, so...

10:12.744 --> 10:15.885
We express deepest
gratitude for this day

10:15.887 --> 10:19.839
and every day, for the
gift of this passage,

10:19.841 --> 10:21.911
and that we have found The Ladder.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.905
There is one Spirit
whose name is Truth.

10:25.907 --> 10:27.778
Come on!

10:27.780 --> 10:30.851
Oh, the squash looks so amazing.

10:30.853 --> 10:32.843
- It's from my garden.
- You are amazing.

10:32.845 --> 10:34.834
I wish I could manage my own garden.

10:34.836 --> 10:36.807
You're so busy with
more important things.

10:36.809 --> 10:38.839
I'm a gardener. It's just who I am.

10:38.841 --> 10:39.950
That's why we work.

10:39.952 --> 10:42.012
- He's a flower.
- Aw.

10:43.887 --> 10:45.837
My mother used to say
the best relationships

10:45.839 --> 10:47.829
have a gardener and a flower.

10:47.831 --> 10:49.841
I'm definitely the gardener.

10:49.843 --> 10:52.874
What? No, you're not. I'm the gardener.

10:52.876 --> 10:53.995
What about you guys?

10:53.997 --> 10:56.918
- I don't know.
- A flower.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.870
You guys really think I'm a flower?

10:58.872 --> 11:00.973
- I'm the gardener?
- Yeah, you're the gardener.

11:00.975 --> 11:02.815
I'm more of a weed.

11:02.817 --> 11:03.996
- You're not a weed.
- Not a flower.

11:03.998 --> 11:06.808
- You're a cactus.
- While you garden me and stuff.

11:06.810 --> 11:07.820
Yes, you are.

11:07.822 --> 11:08.952
Can I ask a real question?

11:08.954 --> 11:11.844
Please. This is the
dumbest conversation.

11:11.846 --> 11:14.847
Uh, this girl from school

11:14.849 --> 11:16.900
asked if I could come to her house.

11:16.902 --> 11:19.853
An IS?

11:19.855 --> 11:21.034
What does she want?

11:21.036 --> 11:24.048
She said there's a problem,
and she needs my help.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.860
Well, you can't.

11:26.862 --> 11:29.012
I also can't refuse someone
who asks for help.

11:29.014 --> 11:31.054
Okay, Dr. Meyer says tween
years are the most vulnerable.

11:31.056 --> 11:33.948
I wouldn't be in this
situation if my dad

11:33.950 --> 11:36.871
would let me leave
school, like I want to.

11:36.873 --> 11:40.865
It can be a dangerous time, Eddie.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.067
But isn't that the point?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.028
For him to get through it,

11:44.030 --> 11:47.041
so he can learn the skills he
needs to deal with the IS?

11:47.043 --> 11:48.994
I mean that's what I was taught.

11:48.996 --> 11:51.086
He's got everything he
needs to start the climb.

11:51.088 --> 11:53.859
The Ladder provides the rest.

11:53.861 --> 11:55.992
Look how great Sarah and I turned out.

11:55.994 --> 11:59.865
Oh, I know, but he'll follow the rules.

11:59.867 --> 12:00.956
He'll leave school when he's 16.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.910
But Doc would bend the
rules for our family.

12:03.912 --> 12:05.952
Eddie and I will talk
about it later, Dad.

12:05.954 --> 12:10.036
And why shouldn't Hawk help this girl?

12:10.038 --> 12:11.979
I mean, isn't that the whole point?

12:11.981 --> 12:14.071
Help when help is asked for.

12:14.073 --> 12:17.045
Bring people to The Light?

12:24.003 --> 12:25.885
Okay.

12:34.894 --> 12:37.005
You hear Snyder got moved to terrorism?

12:37.007 --> 12:38.106
Snyder?

12:38.108 --> 12:40.028
- There's no way.
- I swear to you.

12:40.030 --> 12:41.039
Snyder's useless.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.011
Snyder's a jackass.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.925
- Hey, Abe, do you hear that?
- What's that?

12:45.927 --> 12:48.017
Snyder got moved to terrorism.

12:48.019 --> 12:50.068
Did you guys hear about this
tornado that hit New Hampshire?

12:50.070 --> 12:52.121
Apparently some religious
group showed up in vans

12:52.123 --> 12:53.953
two hours before FEMA.

12:53.955 --> 12:55.004
I heard FEMA came through this time.

12:55.006 --> 12:58.978
Not according to AOL.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.100
Hey, is that coffee ready yet?

13:00.102 --> 13:01.141
What group was it?

13:01.143 --> 13:02.953
Scientologists?

13:02.955 --> 13:05.045
No. Didn't say much.

13:05.047 --> 13:07.126
You know, some small hippie commune.

13:07.128 --> 13:09.089
Meyerist movement.

13:42.729 --> 13:43.798
Sounds like this boy

13:43.800 --> 13:45.851
is going to need months of realignment.

13:45.853 --> 13:48.716
He started using when he was 12?

13:50.718 --> 13:52.888
Can I just unburden for a second?

13:52.890 --> 13:55.821
I know I'm supposed to be
above these kind of feelings,

13:55.823 --> 13:58.724
but I...

13:58.726 --> 14:03.860
I can't stand these
hypocritical, fake followers.

14:03.862 --> 14:05.802
John Ridge wants us to help his son,

14:05.804 --> 14:07.744
but he's ashamed to be
associated with us.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.766
It's a challenge to put
aside our feelings,

14:09.768 --> 14:10.817
but it's for the greater good.

14:10.819 --> 14:12.709
Yeah, and a big donation.

14:12.711 --> 14:14.801
Donation or no donation,

14:14.803 --> 14:18.766
you tell this John Ridge I'm
going to fix his child.

14:18.768 --> 14:22.740
That's how you get someone to believe.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.932
What?

14:24.934 --> 14:28.716
What, Cal?

14:28.718 --> 14:31.879
- How's IRP?
- I don't know.

14:31.881 --> 14:33.782
Eddie won't reveal anything.

14:33.784 --> 14:35.874
Richard wants him to do
the 14 days in-house,

14:35.876 --> 14:36.935
and he won't.

14:36.937 --> 14:39.768
I'm sorry, Sarah.

14:39.770 --> 14:41.901
I know I joke and flirt with you,

14:41.903 --> 14:46.905
and I know you have your
whole family, but...

14:46.907 --> 14:51.761
you know I'm here if you ever...

14:51.763 --> 14:55.825
Thank you.

14:55.827 --> 14:57.928
It'll all work itself out.
We have the tools.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.920
Mm-hmm.

14:59.922 --> 15:01.831
- I have a session.
- Oh.

15:01.833 --> 15:02.922
One more thing.

15:02.924 --> 15:05.826
Local news station asked
for an interview.

15:05.828 --> 15:07.758
Human interest story about us,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.850
'cause we took in the
refugees from the tornado.

15:09.852 --> 15:10.941
Anyway, wanted to talk to you about it.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.863
Oh, you're not thinking about doing it?

15:12.865 --> 15:15.786
Yeah. I am.

15:15.788 --> 15:17.848
What would Steve say?

15:17.850 --> 15:18.969
I think he'd say, "Do it."

15:18.971 --> 15:20.901
I doubt that.

15:20.903 --> 15:22.834
Hi, Mary.

15:22.836 --> 15:23.865
Why don't we talk about it later?

15:23.867 --> 15:25.917
I'll leave you to your meeting.

15:25.919 --> 15:26.968
How are you, Mary?

15:26.970 --> 15:28.880
I'm so good.

15:28.882 --> 15:29.982
You heading out with the novices later?

15:29.984 --> 15:32.905
Yeah. I want to join or whatever.

15:32.907 --> 15:34.866
I like your passion, Mary.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.878
It's a little more
complicated than that.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.002
To start, you'll have to commit
to 500 hours community service,

15:40.004 --> 15:43.816
first run workshops, and
then you can take your vows.

15:43.818 --> 15:44.957
Okay.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.980
Or you can choose to
incorporate our practices

15:46.982 --> 15:48.952
into your daily life
in the regular world.

15:48.954 --> 15:50.013
Study your texts.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.825
Go to the workshops.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.918
You just have to really
believe this is your path,

15:54.920 --> 15:56.960
to take your vows.

15:56.962 --> 15:59.092
This is my path.

15:59.094 --> 16:00.906
That's great to hear, Mary.

16:04.991 --> 16:06.860
Okay, why don't we go into my office,

16:06.862 --> 16:08.954
and we can talk about it? Yeah?

16:15.962 --> 16:18.894
<i>Hey, so these Meyerism people.</i>

16:18.896 --> 16:20.836
- Meyerism people?
- Yes, sir.

16:20.838 --> 16:26.001
The ones that got to Rindge
after the tornado, before FEMA.

16:26.003 --> 16:28.984
No one got to Rindge before FEMA.

16:28.986 --> 16:34.911
Okay, so the Meyerism people
that got there after FEMA

16:34.913 --> 16:36.913
and took some of the storm
refugees back to their camp

16:36.915 --> 16:38.074
in upstate New York. What about 'em?

16:38.076 --> 16:40.006
Some of the refugees aren't responding

16:40.008 --> 16:42.018
to messages from their families.

16:42.020 --> 16:47.974
I'm concerned, and I'm
putting them on cult watch.

16:47.976 --> 16:50.027
Aren't they just a bunch of Dead Heads?

16:50.029 --> 16:51.899
I don't think so, sir.

16:51.901 --> 16:54.061
<i>We can see the ones in need.</i>

16:54.063 --> 16:57.004
<i>The lost ones, the ones in so much pain</i>

16:57.006 --> 17:00.037
<i>they wear it on their faces.</i>

17:00.039 --> 17:03.050
<i>The ones who long for truth,</i>

17:03.052 --> 17:06.164
like her.

17:06.165 --> 17:08.957
How do we get her to come over here?

17:08.959 --> 17:12.931
Maybe you have to go to her.

17:12.933 --> 17:14.113
Come with me?

17:14.115 --> 17:16.086
Okay.

17:18.088 --> 17:23.012
Beautiful kids.

17:23.013 --> 17:24.973
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

17:24.976 --> 17:26.105
We saw that you were
sitting by yourself.

17:26.107 --> 17:28.107
I'm not interested.

17:28.108 --> 17:30.990
Okay, well, if you change
your mind... Sean.

17:30.992 --> 17:32.082
- Sean Egan.
- I won't.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.023
Mary Cox from New Hampshire.

17:34.025 --> 17:36.105
Just saying I'm not, like,
a city person or anything.

17:36.107 --> 17:39.099
Oh, no. Me neither. Washington state.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.051
Where in Washington?

17:41.053 --> 17:42.973
I'm from outside Olympia.

17:42.975 --> 17:44.114
Marysville.

17:44.116 --> 17:45.215
Where the shooting...

17:45.217 --> 17:46.927
My sister.

17:46.929 --> 17:48.939
Was killed?

17:48.941 --> 17:51.031
- My twin.
- I didn't know that.

17:51.033 --> 17:54.014
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

17:54.016 --> 17:55.957
It's good to say out loud.

17:55.959 --> 18:01.943
My twin sister Sheila was killed
by our classmate at school.

18:01.945 --> 18:03.055
I'm so sorry.

18:03.057 --> 18:05.046
My parents can't say it.

18:05.048 --> 18:08.970
How do you keep on going after that?

18:08.972 --> 18:14.036
Well, my parents don't.

18:14.038 --> 18:16.979
They're like zombies.

18:16.981 --> 18:19.132
Meyerism helped me.

18:19.134 --> 18:23.025
It helped me take all of
the anger and the sadness

18:23.027 --> 18:26.028
and put it behind me so that
I can do good in the world.

19:09.027 --> 19:11.056
Hey.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.168
You scared the shit out of me.

19:13.170 --> 19:16.022
Sorry.

19:16.024 --> 19:19.035
You look like shit.

19:19.037 --> 19:21.197
My... my wife.

19:21.199 --> 19:25.052
She followed me to the
hotel the other night.

19:25.054 --> 19:27.194
She thinks I'm having an affair.

19:27.196 --> 19:29.256
Fuck.

19:29.258 --> 19:33.070
Yeah, I'm in the IRP,
Infidelity Rehab Program.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.152
Yeah, I know what it is.

19:35.154 --> 19:39.267
They want me to do 14 days in-house.

19:39.269 --> 19:41.249
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:41.251 --> 19:43.201
Sorry, man. It's not funny.

19:43.203 --> 19:45.203
I mean when you're in it,
it makes so much sense,

19:45.205 --> 19:47.075
but once you're out it's like... pow.

19:47.077 --> 19:51.149
How the hell am I going to do 14 days?

19:51.151 --> 19:54.152
I'll go insane. I mean,
I'll give up names

19:54.154 --> 20:00.129
that don't even exist or
worse I'll tell the truth.

20:00.131 --> 20:02.110
Look.

20:02.112 --> 20:06.245
I don't think I can do this anymore.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.088
What?

20:09.090 --> 20:13.183
Maybe it doesn't matter
if it's real or not.

20:13.185 --> 20:16.316
So what if there's no Light, you know?

20:16.318 --> 20:18.188
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:18.190 --> 20:20.250
Of course it matters. The
truth has to matter.

20:20.252 --> 20:23.173
That's why you joined the
movement in the first place.

20:23.175 --> 20:27.268
That's why you're here right
now, because it fucking matters.

20:27.270 --> 20:30.141
Yeah, but my wife.

20:30.143 --> 20:32.253
My family.

20:32.255 --> 20:34.235
I would die without them.

20:34.237 --> 20:37.298
Yeah, but you can live in a
faith you know is a lie?

20:37.300 --> 20:41.212
First of all, I don't... I
don't know that it's a lie.

20:41.214 --> 20:42.324
And second, isn't that

20:42.326 --> 20:44.206
what the whole fucking
rest of the world does?

20:44.208 --> 20:47.149
They killed my husband
when he tried to leave!

20:47.151 --> 20:49.331
They are trying to kill me,
and they will kill you.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.363
There is no room for doubt.

20:50.365 --> 20:54.136
What are you talking about?

20:54.138 --> 20:57.139
- Nobody has killed anyone.
- Yeah, well,

20:57.141 --> 20:59.354
if you really believe that,
then why are you so afraid?

21:02.227 --> 21:04.327
Six months ago, they
killed my husband in Peru

21:04.329 --> 21:07.161
when he said he was done.

21:07.163 --> 21:09.303
I have spent the last three
months scraping together

21:09.305 --> 21:13.166
$400 to escape San Diego.

21:13.168 --> 21:14.287
I bought a crap car.

21:14.289 --> 21:16.200
Managed to get it across the country.

21:16.202 --> 21:18.232
I just wanted to go home.

21:18.234 --> 21:19.383
I wanted to see my grandparents.

21:19.385 --> 21:23.168
I haven't seen them in 16 years,

21:23.170 --> 21:27.221
but when I got there they
were waiting for me.

21:27.223 --> 21:30.334
They knew where to find me.

21:30.336 --> 21:33.168
I've got nothing.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.349
I've got no home.

21:34.351 --> 21:37.322
No bank account. I'm
living like a fugitive.

21:37.324 --> 21:41.247
My only hope is to find others.

21:41.249 --> 21:43.228
Others like me. Ones like you.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.280
Hey, no, no, no.

21:45.282 --> 21:50.396
I'm not like you.

21:50.398 --> 21:53.289
I'm not.

21:53.291 --> 21:55.324
I don't know about this.

22:01.199 --> 22:02.348
Jason Kemp.

22:02.350 --> 22:04.353
My husband's name was Jason Kemp.

22:08.337 --> 22:10.219
Please.

22:12.342 --> 22:14.213
Please!

22:16.215 --> 22:18.436
Please listen to me!

22:30.253 --> 22:33.084
Try it.

22:33.086 --> 22:36.177
We don't really eat meat.

22:36.179 --> 22:39.040
Who is "we"?

22:39.042 --> 22:40.211
My parents.

22:40.213 --> 22:44.276
Oh. What are they,
hippies or something?

22:44.278 --> 22:46.188
- Sort of.
- Well, Ashley should have

22:46.190 --> 22:48.099
told me she was bringing a
friend home for dinner.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.241
I would have cooked
something different.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.164
No, thank you. It's fine.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.268
I like the vegetables.

22:56.270 --> 22:59.182
Where's your dad?

22:59.184 --> 23:01.224
Oh, he died, hon.

23:01.226 --> 23:04.136
Last year.

23:04.138 --> 23:07.150
I'm sorry.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.174
How did he die?

23:14.110 --> 23:16.200
Okay, just take, like, one bite.

23:16.202 --> 23:18.222
You're so bad, Ash.
He doesn't eat meat.

23:18.224 --> 23:20.143
- You shouldn't force him.
- Yeah, but you have to,

23:20.145 --> 23:22.196
like, try steak at least
once in your life.

23:22.198 --> 23:23.217
Yeah, it's really good.

23:23.219 --> 23:24.288
It is really good.

23:24.290 --> 23:27.161
I'm a great cook.

23:27.163 --> 23:29.134
If you're going to eat it
this is the way to go, right?

23:29.136 --> 23:31.138
Organic grass-fed.

23:35.162 --> 23:37.122
Okay.

23:37.124 --> 23:38.265
I'll try some.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.269
- No pressure, though.
- Yeah.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.133
What do you think?

23:57.135 --> 23:58.174
It's good.

23:58.176 --> 24:00.166
- Really? You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

24:00.168 --> 24:02.129
- You want more?
- No.

24:04.313 --> 24:07.134
Well, I got to clean up

24:07.136 --> 24:09.319
and get this one started
on his homework.

24:18.278 --> 24:19.317
Oh, can...

24:19.319 --> 24:21.299
What?

24:21.301 --> 24:24.362
The door. Could we open it?

24:24.364 --> 24:26.337
One sec.

24:32.342 --> 24:34.393
Did your dad die in a bad way?

24:34.395 --> 24:37.198
What's wrong with you?

24:39.200 --> 24:40.359
What?

24:40.361 --> 24:43.403
You ask, like, really
personal questions.

24:43.405 --> 24:45.284
Oh, sorry.

24:45.286 --> 24:47.276
We're taught to just say what we think.

24:47.278 --> 24:51.271
Otherwise we get burdened.

24:51.273 --> 24:53.295
Like, weighted down.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.240
It was drunk driving.

25:00.242 --> 25:01.412
Oh.

25:01.414 --> 25:05.486
Yeah, my mom doesn't really
like people to know.

25:05.488 --> 25:07.308
Talk about weighted down.

25:07.310 --> 25:10.211
My mom doesn't like
anyone to know anything,

25:10.213 --> 25:12.365
and now we're screwed.

25:14.368 --> 25:17.228
Found all these in the trash.

25:17.230 --> 25:21.503
She hasn't paid the mortgage
in, like, four months.

25:21.505 --> 25:25.417
Now they're going to
take our house away,

25:25.419 --> 25:27.379
and I tried to talk
to her about it too.

25:27.381 --> 25:32.225
I, like, brought these to her,
and she completely freaked out

25:32.227 --> 25:33.386
and started, like, yelling at me.

25:33.388 --> 25:36.388
She was like, "This isn't
any of your business."

25:36.390 --> 25:39.284
Like, refused to hear me.

25:46.322 --> 25:48.442
Sorry.

25:48.444 --> 25:52.448
You helped all those
people in the tornado.

25:58.354 --> 26:01.276
Sorry. It's stupid.

26:10.077 --> 26:14.059
We shouldn't still be doing this.

26:14.061 --> 26:16.261
What's that?

26:16.263 --> 26:19.015
My father had me out there
when I was five years old

26:19.017 --> 26:20.997
handing out fliers.

26:20.999 --> 26:24.001
Well, your dad was a good man.

26:26.024 --> 26:28.985
- You ever talk to your mom?
- Uhuh.

26:28.987 --> 26:31.037
People used to spit at me.

26:31.039 --> 26:33.991
Someone even called Child Services.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.143
Terrible.

26:36.145 --> 26:38.025
You want some?

26:38.027 --> 26:39.206
No?

26:39.208 --> 26:41.229
Things need to change.

26:41.231 --> 26:43.150
The pot?

26:43.152 --> 26:45.022
Yeah, that too. The pot.

26:45.024 --> 26:46.133
The medicine, the flyers.

26:46.135 --> 26:48.105
The media blackout. That was the '70s.

26:48.107 --> 26:52.010
This is a new time.

26:52.012 --> 26:54.102
People need us.

26:54.104 --> 26:55.103
Look!

26:55.105 --> 26:57.055
Look at all the need out there,

26:57.057 --> 27:00.038
and we can reach them.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.061
But those who need The
Ladder find The Ladder.

27:03.063 --> 27:08.077
Not with us on the street
corners like Jews for Jesus.

27:08.079 --> 27:09.308
We have to be realistic.

27:09.310 --> 27:11.190
If the people

27:11.192 --> 27:16.117
could hear what we're about,
they would flock to us.

27:18.119 --> 27:20.209
Can you imagine?

27:20.211 --> 27:24.204
The whole world lived as we do?

27:24.206 --> 27:26.086
We could achieve world peace.

27:26.088 --> 27:27.229
Yeah.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.105
Yeah, I think we're done for the day.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.212
Hi.

28:09.214 --> 28:11.304
You're late.

28:11.306 --> 28:16.209
Yeah. Sorry.

28:16.211 --> 28:20.184
It's just a rough day,
and I got behind.

28:20.186 --> 28:21.307
Is Summer asleep?

28:24.309 --> 28:26.210
Where's Hawk?

28:26.212 --> 28:27.401
You told him he could
go to a girl's house.

28:27.403 --> 28:31.215
I guess he's still at a girl's house.

28:31.217 --> 28:33.200
Sarah.

28:38.204 --> 28:39.414
How are we going to get through this?

28:39.416 --> 28:41.186
The program.

28:41.188 --> 28:42.337
That's how.

28:42.339 --> 28:44.339
It's 14 days. It's
there for a reason...

28:44.341 --> 28:48.423
So I do it, and you
suddenly forgive me?

28:48.425 --> 28:50.356
Yes.

28:50.358 --> 28:54.200
I don't get how me sitting in a cell,

28:54.202 --> 28:55.321
getting my bio realigned,

28:55.323 --> 28:57.353
telling the nitty-gritty of my life

28:57.355 --> 28:59.345
is going to make it better.

28:59.347 --> 29:02.268
Because it's designed
to make it better.

29:02.270 --> 29:06.273
And your pain will just go away?

29:06.275 --> 29:08.317
We have to try.

29:15.204 --> 29:19.196
You know, you said you
never made a mistake,

29:19.198 --> 29:22.282
but maybe you did.

29:24.204 --> 29:26.344
- Me. Come on.
- No.

29:26.346 --> 29:28.225
- Everyone knew it.
- That's not true.

29:28.227 --> 29:29.378
I was a wild card.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.378
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.320
Hey. No. Why?

29:32.322 --> 29:37.326
Why did you, perfect Sarah, want me?

29:37.328 --> 29:39.248
Huh?

29:39.250 --> 29:43.292
You knew that this would happen
somewhere along the way.

29:43.294 --> 29:44.393
- I would fuck up.
- Let me go.

29:44.395 --> 29:47.216
No. I want to know.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.488
I want to know what I am fighting for.

29:49.490 --> 29:51.270
That is why.

29:51.272 --> 29:52.391
That is why I fell in love with you.

29:52.393 --> 29:54.294
What? Because I'm a fuck up?

29:54.296 --> 29:55.335
No. Because we're all the same.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.426
Me and my family.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.388
All of us.

29:58.390 --> 30:03.373
But you, I don't know. You're
different, like a window,

30:03.375 --> 30:06.248
and I saw the world
differently through you.

30:12.295 --> 30:15.388
Stop. No. No!

30:27.401 --> 30:29.341
Let's go to the bedroom.

30:36.431 --> 30:40.352
I am so mad at you.

31:08.435 --> 31:11.435
Mom, Dad?

31:11.437 --> 31:14.309
You guys up here?

31:14.311 --> 31:16.371
Need to talk to you guys.

31:24.412 --> 31:26.401
How could you do this
with someone else?

31:26.403 --> 31:28.333
I only want you.

32:20.094 --> 32:23.897
Hey. Dad made pancakes.

32:23.899 --> 32:25.899
I'm not hungry.

32:25.901 --> 32:27.100
How was dinner with
the girl from school?

32:27.102 --> 32:29.883
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.
How'd it go?

32:29.885 --> 32:30.954
What'd she need help with?

32:30.956 --> 32:32.085
Nothing.

32:32.087 --> 32:33.937
Nothing?

32:33.939 --> 32:35.020
It was dumb.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.933
I'm going to walk to school.

32:38.935 --> 32:42.076
Are you sure?

32:42.078 --> 32:44.058
Everything okay?

32:44.060 --> 32:45.920
Hawk?

32:49.916 --> 32:52.036
It's a ten-minute human interest piece

32:52.038 --> 32:55.110
that the 15 people who watch
the local news will see.

32:55.112 --> 32:58.003
Steve has always said that
media attention will only

32:58.005 --> 33:01.196
bring controversy and ire to
the purity of our movement.

33:01.198 --> 33:04.970
I was with him right before he
went into lockdown writing,

33:04.972 --> 33:07.034
and he said to me,

33:09.036 --> 33:12.008
"The time has come when the
message will bring us love."

33:12.010 --> 33:16.032
Like, he literally said
that to me, Sarah.

33:16.034 --> 33:19.136
I need to hear it from him directly.

33:19.138 --> 33:21.087
Unfortunately that isn't possible.

33:21.089 --> 33:24.100
Sarah, Cal just opened
his heart to you,

33:24.102 --> 33:26.934
and I feel like you didn't open yours.

33:26.936 --> 33:28.996
Now, I know things are
rough at home, but...

33:28.998 --> 33:32.059
What does this have to do
with my marriage, Dad?

33:32.061 --> 33:35.023
Come on, honey. Mom and I talk.

33:35.025 --> 33:36.084
- We talk to Richard.
- Oh, great.

33:36.086 --> 33:38.005
You talk to my guide.

33:38.007 --> 33:39.166
All of these burdens on you guys...

33:39.168 --> 33:43.021
I think it's closing you
off from your work.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.182
That is absolutely not true.

33:44.184 --> 33:47.015
Hank, Hank, please.

33:47.017 --> 33:50.119
Look, Sarah,

33:50.121 --> 33:53.092
I know you know me.

33:53.094 --> 33:54.092
Yes.

33:54.094 --> 33:57.997
I do know you, Cal.

33:57.999 --> 34:03.022
You think I'm seizing an opportunity?

34:03.024 --> 34:05.164
Are you?

34:05.166 --> 34:10.018
Yes. Yes.

34:10.021 --> 34:13.002
That's why Steve wanted me here,
'cause he saw this coming,

34:13.004 --> 34:15.034
the need to reach people.

34:15.036 --> 34:16.176
And what we did in Rindge...
It did that.

34:16.178 --> 34:19.079
It moved people.

34:21.132 --> 34:25.136
It's time, it's time for us
to step out of the shadows.

34:25.138 --> 34:27.197
Come on.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.061
We all want that.

34:30.063 --> 34:32.043
I'm not as high up on
The Ladder as you guys,

34:32.045 --> 34:35.196
but when I look to the light,

34:35.197 --> 34:40.161
I just... I feel it.

34:40.164 --> 34:42.194
It's time.

34:42.196 --> 34:47.018
Let the people know who we are finally.

34:47.021 --> 34:48.062
Let 'em know.

34:54.079 --> 34:56.081
Hey.

34:58.253 --> 35:04.219
Don't, like, tell anyone
about what I told you, okay?

35:06.051 --> 35:07.170
I'm just, like,

35:07.172 --> 35:09.102
really freaked out about
the whole situation,

35:09.104 --> 35:13.177
and they could, like, take our
house away any day now, so...

35:13.179 --> 35:16.129
Isn't there someone you can talk to?

35:16.131 --> 35:18.192
- Yeah, I'm talking to you.
- I can't...

35:18.194 --> 35:20.164
What's going on?

35:20.166 --> 35:23.127
I heard you had Jim Jones over
at your house last night.

35:23.129 --> 35:24.258
Who told you that?

35:24.260 --> 35:27.272
- Carrie Adams.
- Bitch.

35:27.274 --> 35:30.085
Hey, don't you walk away, coward.

35:30.087 --> 35:31.276
Hey, leave him alone.

35:31.278 --> 35:33.188
- Bev, just let him go.
- Hey, hey.

35:33.190 --> 35:36.261
You keep your Kool-Aid away
from my girlfriend, freak.

35:36.263 --> 35:38.125
Oh, my God.

35:41.228 --> 35:45.161
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh!

35:45.163 --> 35:46.302
Guys, stop it!

35:58.377 --> 36:00.167
Hey, Gav.

36:00.169 --> 36:02.169
Hey, Eddie. How's it going?

36:02.171 --> 36:04.221
It's good. It's good.

36:04.223 --> 36:08.115
I was just wondering if I could
look someone up in the system.

36:08.117 --> 36:10.129
Oh, sure. Who's that?

36:11.130 --> 36:13.130
You mind if I do it?

36:13.132 --> 36:15.133
It's just someone who used to be
one of us that isn't anymore.

36:15.135 --> 36:19.117
I can do it for you.

36:19.119 --> 36:20.138
Okay.

36:20.140 --> 36:21.159
Great. Thank you.

36:21.161 --> 36:23.322
His name is Jason.

36:23.324 --> 36:25.235
Jason Kemp.

36:29.239 --> 36:30.339
- Oh.
- What?

36:30.341 --> 36:32.261
The poor thing. It's awful.

36:32.263 --> 36:34.313
He killed himself.

36:34.315 --> 36:38.198
Does it say how?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.169
Hello?

36:40.171 --> 36:42.283
Yeah, this is him.

37:09.182 --> 37:10.312
You want to tell me what's going on?

37:10.314 --> 37:13.174
Nothing's going on.

37:13.176 --> 37:14.376
- You got into a fight.
- Yeah.

37:14.378 --> 37:17.278
Well, what am I supposed to do
when someone calls me a freak?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.380
Not fight.

37:18.382 --> 37:20.222
Come on, we don't fight.

37:20.224 --> 37:23.245
We're above that.

37:23.247 --> 37:25.227
Yeah. Try being here.

37:25.229 --> 37:28.223
- Okay. I know.
- No, you don't.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.247
I ate steak, Dad.

37:34.249 --> 37:37.270
Oh.

37:37.272 --> 37:39.262
That's okay, kid.

37:39.264 --> 37:41.284
- It's not that bad.
- Yeah, it is.

37:41.286 --> 37:44.318
It is bad, 'cause you do one thing,

37:44.320 --> 37:46.370
and you think it's just a little
thing, and it's not that bad.

37:46.372 --> 37:48.392
And the next thing you know
everything's out of control,

37:48.394 --> 37:51.335
and I just want the
world back in control.

37:51.337 --> 37:54.218
Okay, hey, Hawk, slow down.

37:54.220 --> 37:57.501
- What happened, Dad?
- What?

37:57.503 --> 38:00.245
You were going to let me
leave this stupid place

38:00.247 --> 38:03.287
until you went on your retreat.

38:03.289 --> 38:05.269
I think you did something there.

38:05.271 --> 38:07.522
Something bad with someone.

38:07.524 --> 38:11.248
Someone who wasn't Mom.

38:13.270 --> 38:14.310
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

38:14.312 --> 38:16.302
Nobody had to tell me.

38:16.304 --> 38:17.423
I listen.

38:17.425 --> 38:21.376
I can hear the truth.

38:21.378 --> 38:23.299
Hey, hey, hey.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.281
I'm sorry.

38:25.283 --> 38:27.393
I am so sorry.

38:27.395 --> 38:31.268
I love you guys,

38:31.270 --> 38:34.441
and I would never do
anything to hurt you.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.473
Well, you did hurt us.

38:36.475 --> 38:41.278
I know you hurt Mom, and
you really hurt me,

38:41.280 --> 38:44.271
and now, God, everything's
just messed up and confusing,

38:44.273 --> 38:47.437
and I just want everything
back the way it used to be.

38:51.321 --> 38:52.500
And you should let me leave school.

38:52.502 --> 38:55.375
You shouldn't make me stay
here because of your mistake.

39:14.495 --> 39:16.347
Hello?

39:18.350 --> 39:20.480
Mary? What are you doing here?

39:20.482 --> 39:23.333
Looking for you.

39:23.335 --> 39:25.405
- Oh.
- Hope you're not mad.

39:25.407 --> 39:28.370
- No.
- What are you doing here?

39:31.443 --> 39:33.335
Thinking.

39:36.339 --> 39:40.491
Sean and I signed up three
people from the park yesterday.

39:40.493 --> 39:42.404
They're coming to the next gathering.

39:42.406 --> 39:45.366
Well, you're a natural.

39:45.368 --> 39:50.472
Yeah, well, it's easy when you believe.

39:50.474 --> 39:51.553
And I believe in you.

39:51.555 --> 39:56.398
No, you believe in the movement.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.452
No.

39:59.454 --> 40:01.536
I believe in you.

40:04.418 --> 40:06.499
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

40:06.501 --> 40:08.381
Please?

40:15.511 --> 40:18.532
Oh. Oh.

40:22.508 --> 40:23.519
Oh.

41:27.577 --> 41:30.628
Love Sean.

41:30.630 --> 41:32.582
You're beautiful together.

41:37.468 --> 41:41.471
Together you'll bring
so many to The Ladder.

41:53.988 --> 41:55.271
- Hey?
- Hmm?

42:01.056 --> 42:04.078
Good morning.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.100
Hey.

42:06.102 --> 42:09.153
I wanted to talk to you about
something really quick,

42:09.155 --> 42:12.106
before the kids get up.

42:12.108 --> 42:17.071
I've just been thinking
about it all night.

42:17.073 --> 42:18.224
What?

42:22.229 --> 42:25.182
I'm going to do the program, Sarah.

42:28.196 --> 42:33.198
The 14 days.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.163
Hmm?

42:38.166 --> 42:42.210
Why all of a sudden?

42:45.103 --> 42:50.046
I just want this to be over with.

42:50.048 --> 42:55.232
I want to be back to before.

42:55.234 --> 42:59.077
Everything was so clear,

42:59.079 --> 43:03.232
and now I feel like I don't know.

43:08.188 --> 43:13.191
- I want to get back too.
- Yeah.

43:13.193 --> 43:15.286
Let's get back.

43:24.275 --> 43:27.218
I am so glad you're doing this, Eddie.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.257
Thanks for talking sense into me, kid.

43:38.259 --> 43:40.270
Sorry I got in a fight, Dad.

43:40.272 --> 43:42.292
- Now we're even.
- Yeah.

43:42.294 --> 43:45.117
But we have to be better than the IS.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.152
Aw, honey.

43:52.134 --> 43:54.254
- I'll see you in a couple weeks.
-  Okay.

43:59.132 --> 44:00.253
Ready?

44:34.199 --> 44:35.269
Ready?

44:35.271 --> 44:39.383
As I'll ever be.

44:39.385 --> 44:42.356
Today I'm talking to Calvin
Roberts, Guardian of The Light.

44:42.358 --> 44:44.278
Is that right?

44:44.280 --> 44:46.310
Our founder is The Guardian.

44:46.312 --> 44:50.174
You can just call me...

44:50.176 --> 44:52.177
Responsible for East Coast.

44:52.179 --> 44:54.359
All right. Take it back.

44:54.361 --> 44:56.321
Today I'm talking to Calvin Roberts,

44:56.323 --> 44:59.365
responsible for the East
Coast Meyerist movement,

44:59.367 --> 45:01.276
a little-known cult

45:01.278 --> 45:03.318
whose headquarters are
situated in upstate New York.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.469
Excuse me.

45:04.471 --> 45:07.363
If I can just interrupt.

45:07.365 --> 45:10.326
First, I want to thank you
so much for having me,

45:10.328 --> 45:13.279
and second, I just want to
set the record straight.

45:13.281 --> 45:15.352
- Meyerism is not a cult.
- Oh, no?

45:15.354 --> 45:17.263
No, we're a movement.

45:17.265 --> 45:21.487
A movement of people with
a very simple vision

45:21.489 --> 45:27.304
to be everything God intended
when He created us in His image,

45:27.306 --> 45:32.269
so we believe that by achieving
personal enlightenment,

45:32.271 --> 45:33.421
or Truth,

45:33.423 --> 45:39.287
we can achieve universal
enlightenment, universal Truth.

45:39.289 --> 45:40.418
I know, I know.

45:40.420 --> 45:42.320
It sounds a little idealistic,

45:42.322 --> 45:45.373
but the great triumphs of the centuries

45:45.375 --> 45:49.287
were achieved by the
idealism of individuals,

45:49.289 --> 45:54.312
so we aim to be Light

45:54.314 --> 45:57.276
and eradicate the world's suffering.

45:57.278 --> 45:59.248
That's a tall order.

45:59.250 --> 46:00.429
The world is full of suffering.

46:00.431 --> 46:02.421
I mean, I wouldn't even know
where to begin to do...

46:02.423 --> 46:05.315
Well, no. No, that's why so many

46:05.317 --> 46:08.287
don't begin, because you're right.

46:08.289 --> 46:09.448
It's just... It's too overwhelming,

46:09.450 --> 46:15.317
and that's why we train
ourselves to listen...

46:16.388 --> 46:22.292
Because if you listen very closely,

46:22.294 --> 46:25.315
you will hear the souls
calling out for help.

46:25.317 --> 46:30.281
And you will find that some
of them are in your backyard,

46:30.283 --> 46:34.405
<i>and maybe if you listen
even more closely</i>

46:34.407 --> 46:38.490
<i>you'll find that the soul in
need of care is your own.</i>

46:38.492 --> 46:43.295
<i>And then if you follow this
way, the path of Meyerism,</i>

46:43.297 --> 46:46.348
<i>someone'll reach out to you,
or you'll reach out to them,</i>

46:46.350 --> 46:48.380
<i>and you will have started.</i>

46:48.382 --> 46:51.434
<i>One soul at a time,</i>

46:51.436 --> 46:53.586
<i>and then who knows?</i>

46:53.588 --> 46:57.500
<i>But perhaps one soul at a time</i>

46:57.502 --> 47:01.414
<i>we transform</i>

47:01.416 --> 47:06.409
<i>our broken, broken world</i>

47:06.411 --> 47:09.425
<i>into a place that is whole again.</i>

47:12.327 --> 47:15.491
Well, that sounds...

47:18.524 --> 47:21.347
Sign me up.

47:54.472 --> 47:56.573
Cal.

47:56.575 --> 47:59.466
Wow. Amazing interview.

47:59.468 --> 48:00.647
Unbelievable.

48:00.649 --> 48:02.529
Really, I put it on my Facebook page.

48:02.531 --> 48:05.572
- I've gotten over 500 likes.
- Thanks.

48:05.574 --> 48:06.583
Sit down.

48:06.585 --> 48:08.477
Join us for brunch.

48:12.532 --> 48:14.454
Not today.

48:16.456 --> 48:18.446
We're taking your son,

48:18.448 --> 48:22.560
and I promise we will
get him off drugs,

48:22.562 --> 48:25.513
but here's what I need from you.

48:25.515 --> 48:30.559
You're going to take The Eye
from your little museum,

48:30.561 --> 48:32.441
and you're going to hang it prominently

48:32.443 --> 48:33.572
on the wall above the piano.

48:33.574 --> 48:36.516
And then you're going
to get another Eye,

48:36.518 --> 48:38.527
and you're going to
hang it in your office.

48:38.529 --> 48:43.613
And then you're going to
tell everyone you invest for

48:43.615 --> 48:49.439
about this movement
that has spoken to you,

48:49.441 --> 48:54.444
that has made you see
the world in a new way,

48:54.446 --> 48:56.526
and that has saved your son.

48:56.528 --> 48:59.720
What the fuck? You
cannot do this to me!

48:59.722 --> 49:01.582
I'm a prisoner!

49:01.584 --> 49:05.486
I'm gonna call the cops!

49:05.488 --> 49:06.607
Mom!

49:06.609 --> 49:10.531
Please, Mom! Help!

49:10.533 --> 49:12.583
Because I don't give a shit
about your million dollars,

49:12.585 --> 49:15.519
Mr. Ridge.

49:17.611 --> 49:19.643
I want your faith.

49:23.558 --> 49:25.498
Okay, let's go to work.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.589
The Truth is the most
precious thing in life.

49:27.591 --> 49:29.601
Would you agree?

49:29.603 --> 49:31.634
And why is it precious?

49:31.636 --> 49:33.516
- Brings us to The Light.
- To The Light.

49:33.518 --> 49:35.608
Ah! You're doing good.

49:35.610 --> 49:37.660
Sarah's an easy person
to love, isn't she?

49:37.662 --> 49:40.604
First time you saw her, did
you think anything sexually?

49:40.606 --> 49:42.536
- Of course.
- Is there anything

49:42.538 --> 49:45.488
different about the way that
you thought sexually about her

49:45.490 --> 49:47.621
than any other woman than
you think sexually about?

49:47.623 --> 49:49.523
Come on. The truth.

49:49.525 --> 49:52.496
You got to unburden here. Tell me.

49:52.498 --> 49:56.651
Tell me what you saw when
you met Miranda Frank!

49:56.653 --> 50:00.625
What turned you on about Miranda Frank?

50:00.627 --> 50:02.556
I already told you.

50:02.558 --> 50:05.560
I already told you, okay! Okay!

50:05.562 --> 50:06.591
What else do you want to hear?

50:06.593 --> 50:07.592
What's the matter with you?

50:07.594 --> 50:09.584
What else do you want to hear?

50:09.586 --> 50:10.625
What else do you want to hear?
Why can't you tell the truth?

50:10.627 --> 50:11.737
Were you thinking of Sarah,

50:11.739 --> 50:14.640
or were you thinking...
Driving me nuts.

50:14.642 --> 50:16.612
Can't even get to the basics.

50:16.614 --> 50:17.733
How are we going to get anywhere?

50:17.735 --> 50:20.746
You're wasting my time.

50:20.748 --> 50:23.539
You know, I've given
my life to this work.

50:23.541 --> 50:24.730
It's everything to me.

50:24.732 --> 50:27.614
You're driving me out
of my fucking mind.

50:27.616 --> 50:29.666
I've never had anybody
as difficult as you.

50:29.668 --> 50:33.569
You know that? What's wrong with you?

50:33.571 --> 50:36.553
- Why can't you tell the truth?
- <i>Eddie, what do you see?</i>

50:36.555 --> 50:39.646
What?

50:39.648 --> 50:40.707
What's wrong with you?

50:46.556 --> 50:47.655
What?

50:47.657 --> 50:48.746
In here?

51:34.647 --> 51:36.827
Off to Cusco?

51:36.829 --> 51:38.789
It's incredible

51:38.791 --> 51:42.633
how many phone calls we've
received since your interview.

51:42.635 --> 51:44.725
I guess Steve was right.

51:44.727 --> 51:45.846
Your message brought love.

51:45.848 --> 51:48.800
- Things are changing, Sarah.
- Yeah.

51:48.802 --> 51:51.623
Things better with Eddie?

51:51.625 --> 51:52.734
Has he unburdened?

51:52.736 --> 51:54.666
Miranda Frank.

51:54.668 --> 51:55.798
I always knew.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.670
Anyway, someone from
Midwest will talk to her.

51:58.672 --> 52:00.722
That's good.

52:00.724 --> 52:03.826
Things'll be better.

52:03.828 --> 52:07.812
- Send Steve my love.
- Absolutely, I will.

52:18.653 --> 52:20.766
Miranda?

52:25.701 --> 52:26.872
Hi.

52:44.912 --> 52:48.763
It was extraordinary.

52:48.765 --> 52:51.847
I mean, I know it was just
some small, local thing,

52:51.849 --> 52:54.852
but you have to start somewhere...

53:01.760 --> 53:03.832
And I think you would have been proud.

53:06.804 --> 53:09.738
It could be a new era for us.

53:11.740 --> 53:13.877
The era of The Ladder.
