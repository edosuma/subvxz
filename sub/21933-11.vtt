"Ink cartridge

00:11.612 --> 00:13.081
(STUTTERS) Okay,
what does that even mean?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.483
Do we need to sound
it out together?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.552
Okay, I got it.
All right, here it is.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.090
Uh...
Oh, "re-insert cartridge"

00:22.156 --> 00:23.591
okay,
"with nozzle facing you."

00:23.657 --> 00:24.792

I did the nozzles.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.675

the business upstairs,

01:20.181 --> 01:22.283
and I... I would just
really appreciate it

01:22.350 --> 01:24.685
if you would stop leaving
these stupid flyers
all over the place.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.720

01:26.787 --> 01:28.756
we're gonna have
a problem, sweety.
ALEJANDRO: I'm sorry.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.024
We're new to the neighborhood.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.026
We want people
to know we're here.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.864
Yes, of course you do. Hi.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.034
And yes, you are here.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.371
Hi, uh, my name is Alejandro.
Hello. (CHUCKLES)

Corazon means

01:49.009 --> 01:51.479
Love...that.

01:51.545 --> 01:52.613
Love that.
Mm.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.782
Um, I'm
from Monkey Fist.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.151
(STUTTERS) Which means...
Um, Monkey Fist.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.552
Yeah.
And, and, you know what?

01:58.619 --> 02:01.155
Don't worry about the flyers.
I just had a cousin got...

02:01.222 --> 02:03.291
She got hit by one,
and lost the tip of her ear.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.958
It was the bottom part.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.860
Um, so it's okay.
You know, her hair covers it,

02:06.927 --> 02:08.061
but she can't wear earrings,
'cause you know,

02:08.128 --> 02:11.699
there's no meat there,
right? So...
Oh,

02:11.765 --> 02:13.501
um, thank you
for stopping by.
Yes.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.869
I should get back
to my client now.
Totally. Yes. Of course.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.206
And I'm so sorry about the...

02:18.272 --> 02:20.140
Ear... Mea...meat story?
It's just...

02:20.208 --> 02:21.209
Yeah.
It's okay.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.876
Okay. (AWKWARD CHUCKLES)

02:36.757 --> 02:37.791
What?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.393
Nothing, I just

02:39.460 --> 02:41.128
had a beautiful
image in my mind,

02:41.195 --> 02:42.730
and...now it is gone.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.399
All right, well,
we're out of mayo,

02:45.466 --> 02:46.500
and I bought last time.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.568
So, I know it's your turn.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.036
You are a saint.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.103
(DEEP BREATH) Hey...

02:50.170 --> 02:51.339
(STUTTERS) You know that, uh,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.374
new gym downstairs, right?
One with the flyers?

02:53.441 --> 02:54.508
I hate that gym.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.643
It used to be that
awesome place

02:55.709 --> 02:57.245
that made those
spicy beef patties?

02:57.311 --> 02:59.146
"Jamaican Me Happy."

02:59.213 --> 03:02.250
Ah! I miss those guys.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.752
It's "Jamaican Me Sad."

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
You do know

03:07.655 --> 03:09.357
that you have a sandwich
in your hand, right?
Yeah.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.059
A very dry sandwich.
I got no mayo on here.
Okay.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.394
All right.
I am muscling through.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.162
Okay!

03:15.229 --> 03:19.032
Anyway, the gym owner
is gorgeous.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.469
And I went in there,
and I kind of screwed it up.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.071
So I was hoping you would
go down there, and, and,
and talk to him for me.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.573
Just get some,
like, details.
(SIGHS)

03:25.639 --> 03:27.207
Is he single?
What's he into?

03:27.275 --> 03:29.843
And while you're there,
talk me up a little bit.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.380
I don't wanna get in the
middle of this, all right?

03:32.446 --> 03:33.681
Let's just cut the dance.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.216
You go back down there,
ruin it,

03:36.284 --> 03:38.719
come back up here,
start crying,

03:38.786 --> 03:41.188
I hand you a Kleenex,
we move on to the next guy.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.957
Please?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.359
No, I ca...
Oh, okay, all right!
How about this?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.761
You know that giant monkey
you've been bugging me about?

03:47.828 --> 03:51.299
You mean the inflatable one
that goes on top of the
building to promote business?

03:51.365 --> 03:53.301
Stands there all badass...
(GRUNTING)

03:57.137 --> 03:59.707
If you do this for me,
I will let you buy it
and put it on the roof.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.042
Okay.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.278
Now, where do we stand
with the whole mayo situation?

04:04.345 --> 04:06.947
Because I still
have half a sandwich.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.115
I will get to it, eventually.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.451
Oh. Okay, you know what?

04:10.518 --> 04:13.220
And I will talk
to the guy...eventually.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.356
Fine!

04:15.423 --> 04:17.591
Squeeze bottle, too, because
I don't wanna use a knife!
Oh, my God!

04:17.658 --> 04:19.159
I don't like using knives!

04:23.764 --> 04:26.734
Oh, Chale, just, uh, put this
on my tab? Thanks, buddy.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.636
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.938

people run up tabs.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.375
Oh. He means, uh,
regular people, not heroes.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.379
No, he mentioned you by name.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.448

I'm sorry, Uncle Kyle.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.019
Chale's just stressed
because Enzo's on vacation,

04:46.086 --> 04:48.288
and this is his first week
running the place by himself.

"At least I don't have
to make mozzarella
sticks for a living."

05:04.638 --> 05:06.206
Chale's just stressed out,

05:06.273 --> 05:07.908
because we found out
that the health inspector's
gonna come by.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.877
CHALE: (SIGHS) Yes.
And if we get a bad report,

05:09.943 --> 05:12.312
I'm gonna have to answer
to Enzo, and... (GRUNTS)

you've never seen.

about, all right?

of the hibernation phase,
these Doritos.

out for me, so...

for an extra-large then.

for a medium.

So, what's the scoop?
Did you talk to Alejandro?

07:53.874 --> 07:54.975
I did. Yeah.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.010
And? What's the deal?
Is he single?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.411
No. He's married...

07:59.547 --> 08:01.949
to his work.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.018
Oh. All right.
So, what happened?
Did you talk me up?

08:05.085 --> 08:06.920
Uh, it never really came up,
so I didn't get a chance.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.421
All right. You know what?

All right. I'll back off.
Yeah. There you go.

it's gonna take?

08:29.977 --> 08:33.113

My trainer gave me the recipe.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.539
Oh, you taking this
"working out" thing seriously?
Oh, yeah.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.308
You know, I...
I need a trainer.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.778
Didi told me,
I don't lose weight,
she ain't losing weight.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.047
Man, I need to lose weight.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.115
All right.
Well, after six weeks,

09:08.181 --> 09:09.650
I'll give you
the number, okay?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.785
Wait. Six weeks?
He doesn't have room
for one more client?

09:11.852 --> 09:13.086
No, look. I can't...

09:13.153 --> 09:15.188
He's gotta be focused
on me right now. Believe me.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.891
Vanessa tried dating him.
I shut that noise down.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.393
Yeah, good man.
'Cause she's a snow wrecker.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.528
Snow wrecker?
GOODY: Yeah.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.631
You know,
when the snow's all fresh

09:23.697 --> 09:26.600
and someone comes,
runs through, tramples
all over it, ruins it.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.502
She is a snow wrecker. Yeah!

09:29.569 --> 09:31.939
Remember what she did with
the guy at the bagel shop
when she dated him?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.707
Yeah, she dumped him.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.009
Now we can't go there anymore
'cause he started
spitting in our food.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.815
He's gonna spit in our food?
You never told me that.
I still go there.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.016
I'm sure you're good.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.351
(SIGHS)

09:44.417 --> 09:46.386
Yo, buddy, what's going
on here? What is this?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.588
I'm eating cereal. I'm hungry.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.291
No, you're having poison.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.826
You bought this for me.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.796
Yeah, well, I'm taking
it back now.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.031
Today, we're having
some auliflower pancakes.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.833
Man, you're a snow wrecker!

10:05.873 --> 10:07.407
Why is he taking so long?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.009
And writing so much?

10:09.076 --> 10:12.112
Maybe he's appreciating
how clean this place looks.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.148
Oh, boy. He just kicked
the can of tuna that's
keeping the fridge level.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.051
He's gonna shut us down.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.954
Enzo's gonna freak.
I can't breathe.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.924
Relax. All part
of the game. You're fine.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.259
Now. wipe the sweat
off your lip.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.161
Your little mustache
is getting all drippy.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.864
Here he comes.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.002
I hope everything
was satisfactory.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.505
Generally, things look okay,
but I do have a list
of violations.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.675
This seems lengthy.

10:41.742 --> 10:46.246
I'm gonna give you
a couple days to get them
corrected and I'll be back.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.716
And you should wipe
the sweat off your lip.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.017
You're working with food.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.287
Look at all these violations.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.089
I can't get these done
in a couple days.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.758
Here, let me help you.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.795
(EXCLAIMS)
What are you doing?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.296
It's not about the list.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.332
He doesn't want
the "violations corrected."

11:05.398 --> 11:07.968
He wants a little...
(KISSING)

11:08.035 --> 11:09.569
What?
A kiss.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.404
A little taste of honey.
A little guap.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.673
What is he saying?

11:13.741 --> 11:16.076
I think he's saying,
the inspector wants a bribe.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.711
Bingo.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.913
But I'm trying to get people
to start saying guap.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.316
Slowly.
Slowly.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.818
Breathe.
(INHALES)

11:24.885 --> 11:26.153
Enjoy.
I'm enjoying.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.088
Yes. Now, go down.
Oh, down.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.857
(BOTH INHALE)

11:29.923 --> 11:31.591

11:31.658 --> 11:34.261

11:34.327 --> 11:36.629
(ALEJANDRO AND VANESSA
CHATTER INDISTINCTLY)

11:38.298 --> 11:39.967
ALEJANDRO: Can you feel your
core starting to engage?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.235
Hells yeah, I feel it.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.138
What's going on here?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.240
I was just giving Vanessa
a consultation.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.376
Oh, you two know each other?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.445
Well, I was upstairs
and thought,

11:52.512 --> 11:54.347
"Never the wrong time
for fitness,"

11:54.414 --> 11:56.383
so I took the initiative
and came down.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.019
I thought we talked
about you waiting.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.621
You two know each other?
I didn't know that.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.623
Interesting.
He didn't know that.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.395
She's so funny, this one.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.530
Yeah, she's a rip.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.598
You're funnny!

12:14.367 --> 12:16.703
Kevin, if you don't mind,
I don't want her heart rate
to get too low.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.773
Sweetie, I don't think
we're in any danger
of that happening.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.912
Anyway, I was hoping to sneak
in another workout tonight.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.680
Sorry, my friend.
We made plans for dinner.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.748
Isn't that great?

12:28.816 --> 12:31.318
I'll e-mail you instructions.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.386
What about
"iron sharpens iron"?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.023
Maybe tonight,
you sharpen your own iron.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.064
You made a promise
to me about total focus?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.198
Work with me, brother.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.334
Yeah, work with him, brother.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.203
All right.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.209
(GRUNTING)

12:56.276 --> 12:58.011
What's next?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.815
A burpee?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.017
What is a...
What's a burpee?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.455
What is a burpee?

13:08.521 --> 13:10.223
SIRI: I found this.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.624
Yeah, that's not happening.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.929
Hey, Dad.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.332
I went out with some friends
for Chinese and we ordered
way too much, have at it.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.101
(GRUNTS) Can't. I'm training.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.370

if you change your mind.

I got your voice mail.

It's Kevin Gable.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.758
I'm staring
at some Chinese food,
don't know what to do.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.161
I mean, I know
what I wanna do

13:48.228 --> 13:49.629
but I don't know
what to do.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.633
Hit me back.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.635
(PHONE BEEPS)
Okay, it's me again.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.638
I ate a spare rib.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.009
Really need you, man.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.576
All right.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.378
Dumplings are gone.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.381
That's on you.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.617
Call me back.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.454
Hey man, I gotta
own the dumplings.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.722
That's on me.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.758
Just delete the last message
and call me.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.994
We're still good.
I'm not mad at you.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.131
I just ate a carton
of lo mein.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.999
Small carton

14:26.066 --> 14:28.568
'cause I remember
what you said
about portion control.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.238
So, I'm doing good, right?
I mean, it's kinds good.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.976
(SIGHS) I'm not doing good.
Call me!

14:36.043 --> 14:37.444
You know what it is?
Here's what it is.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.811
I'm gonna tell you what it is.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.450
(STUTTERS) I wanna have
power over the food.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.285
And I show that

14:45.352 --> 14:46.920
by eating it.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.958
No, I'm not saying that.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.193
But I'm telling you right now,
people were looking at me.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.028
They were looking at me
like I was the next thing.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.197
I was the next thing.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.033
My emotions, they just
kind of take over

15:00.100 --> 15:03.503
and then I gotta
eat savory, and then sweet.
It just goes back and...

15:03.570 --> 15:05.072
It's happening right now.
I gotta go!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.841
Guess you're not back
from your dinner yet.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.945
That's a late supper.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.713
That is not healthy.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.583
Here's an idea,
Practice what you preach!

15:21.754 --> 15:22.755

15:24.057 --> 15:25.959
Lemme tell you
something, Jack-o.

15:26.026 --> 15:28.328
The world's a dark,
dark place.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.433
You put your trust in someone,
and they letcha down.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.635
Know what didn't let us down?

15:35.702 --> 15:38.005
That pork fried rice.
Mm.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.772
That is true.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.409
Teachable moment, Jack,

15:42.475 --> 15:44.211
pork anything
never lets you down.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.946
I hear ya.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.784
It's from Alejandro.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.687
"Stay strong, bro.
You're doing great."

15:56.689 --> 15:57.690
(SIGHS)

15:58.591 --> 16:00.393
Aw, man, I really messed up.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
It's one slip up.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.163
Eh.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.000
Not gonna let this define me.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.301
Wow.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.170
That was a hard turn.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.740
Yeah, it was.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.509
I'm back on the healthy train,
and so are you.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.111
I can't keep doing this.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.314
He doesn't look happy.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.850
Of course he's not happy.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.352
We didn't do
one thing on the list

16:25.418 --> 16:27.220
because your crazy uncle
ripped it to shreds.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.422
Guys, forget the list.
It's not about the list.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.791
Do you have the envelope
with the $200 in it?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.260
No, I don't.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.463
We talked about it.
We both think it's a bad idea.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.032
It's better to get a citation
than to do something illegal.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.333
Exactly.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.569
All right, now, I gotta go
to class at law school.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.809
So, what do I do?
Just hand it to him?

16:49.876 --> 16:52.945
No. You put it on the counter,
slide it over to him,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.881
and give him the little
kiss he came for.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.918
Okay. Here we go.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.388
Mr. Witt. Most of the
violations weren't addressed,

17:01.454 --> 17:03.290
and I see you put
the tuna can back.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.924
Ah, put your pen down, Dwight.

17:06.826 --> 17:10.230
I think we both know
what you're really here for.
Excuse me?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.900
A little guap.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.570
(WHISTLES)

17:19.439 --> 17:20.940
Did you just blow me a kiss?

17:21.007 --> 17:23.310
Yes, but it was just
to draw your attention
to the envelope.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.678
(KISSING) It has money in it.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.781
You do know it's illegal
to bribe a county official?

17:28.848 --> 17:31.684
Whoa! I think we have
a misunderstanding here.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.020
What the boy's
trying to say is,

17:34.087 --> 17:38.391
some money fell on the bar,
and we thought,
it might belong to you.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.060
Know'm sayin'?

17:41.128 --> 17:42.929
I don't.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.633
I am simply here to make sure
this establishment's up to
Nassau County code.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.304
Wow. Totally misread that one.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.307
My bad.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.875
Just put my beers on my tab.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.810
There is no tab!
You have to pay.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.247
Take it out of this.
That's my money!

18:00.313 --> 18:03.150
You might wanna be nicer
to the guy that might
bail you out of jail.

18:08.855 --> 18:12.225
Hey.
Listen, I'm sorry.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.629
You have the right
to date anyone you want.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.632
And there's no reason
why the two of us can't...
You can have him.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.700
What?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.001
Alejandro.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.536
We went on
our date last night.
He's a bore.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.605
You shut your mouth.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.976
All he talks about is fitness.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.545
You know he actually
weighs out his food?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.382
That's so Alejandro.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.385
Well, he's all yours.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.320
Really?

18:40.387 --> 18:43.856
I'm gonna go surprise him.
He loves surprises.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.458
Yeah, that doesn't
sound weird at all.

18:45.525 --> 18:46.693
KEVIN: Don't care!

18:51.398 --> 18:54.066
Alejandro, good news...
Your physique.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.336
You have the perfect
athletic bone structure.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.271
You're what we
call a mesomorph.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.772
Wait. Hey...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.508
Alejandro, what's going on?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.842
We're supposed
to meet at 4:00.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.412
Well, surprise, surprise.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.813
Who's this?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.114
Just a client.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.449
Just a client?
Mm.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.918
'Cause that speech
sounded awfully familiar.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.254
Did he tell you,
you're a Dorito?

19:14.321 --> 19:16.623
Yes, he did.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.727
Well, I hope you two
are very happy together.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.562
Kevin, I'm a trainer.
I have other clients.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.163
I don't think so.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.998
Kevin, I'm a trainer.
Don't.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.068
I liked this so much better
when this was a Jamaican
beef patty place!

19:29.135 --> 19:31.538
Kevin. Kevin...

19:39.412 --> 19:41.214
Are you happy now?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.616
Gotta be honest, I really am.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.152
Sorry it didn't
work out for you.
It's fine.

19:46.219 --> 19:50.557
Let's agree to never let a man
come between us again.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.759
Let's also agree never to
phrase it like that again.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.461
Let's get inside. It's cold.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.564
Wait, I want you to admit,
this whole monkey thing
was a good idea.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.533
People can see it
from all around the city.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.170
This is advertising.
It's gonna be so helpful.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.306
And everything we do...

20:06.373 --> 20:08.708
Monkey! Monkey!

20:10.009 --> 20:11.944
Oh, we're in trouble.

20:12.011 --> 20:15.648
No, no, we're fine.
Now, we're drifting...

20:15.715 --> 20:18.117
It'll make it past the trees.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.253
It's heading towards
the power lines.
We're in trouble.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.455
Well, they won't know it's us.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.957
I wrote my name
on the foot.
