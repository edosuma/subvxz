Fugitive Gaming
are up two to one

00:20.803 --> 00:22.413
here in our best-of-five final.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.633
And I think,
for a player like Creamcheese,

00:24.676 --> 00:26.852
it's got to be about
setting up for the team

00:26.896 --> 00:28.767
and keeping that mental strong.

00:32.641 --> 00:34.425
[exhales]

-It's an emergency?

No, I mean, like,
I just want to empty my bladder

00:42.520 --> 00:44.392
so that I don't have
to worry about it,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.481
like, in the middle of the game,
like, it's gonna hurt my focus.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.961
Like, I'm gonna lose track
of the jungle and all that.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.354

Of course, you can see TSM now
taking the stage with confidence

01:01.365 --> 01:03.193
after striking back here
in this series,

01:03.237 --> 01:05.500
but Fugitive Gaming
still back in the team room.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.980
AZAEL:
And look at the poise
on Foresite's face.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.982
This guy makes
late-series adjustments

01:10.026 --> 01:12.072
better than anyone in the game.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.900
Right. This is-- And remember,
not just Foresite in general,

01:14.944 --> 01:19.296
but TSM Foresite, specifically,
never lost a game five.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.864
When you pair a player
of this caliber with an org

01:21.907 --> 01:25.955
that has this level of success,
it's just a massive undertaking

01:25.998 --> 01:28.175
to go up against
anybody like that.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.307
Come on, Cream, it's time to go.

01:49.065 --> 01:51.023
how I'm gonna choke.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.374
Again, against Foresite.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.159
You know,
a lot of us out here think

01:56.203 --> 01:57.595
that you're the guy to stop him.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.684
I'm trying, Braxton.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.209
Trying so fucking hard.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.518
Trevor, I have seen you become
a better player this past year.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.825
A better teammate,
better communicat--

02:09.868 --> 02:12.132
-You trust other people.
-Apparently doesn't
fucking matter.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.786
But that's not the guy
I saw play in game three.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.486
You were selfish, acting like
it was just you and Foresite.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.401
-I was just trying to win us
the fucking game.
-Oh, bullshit.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.403
You were trying to be the hero.

02:24.187 --> 02:28.365
And if you really want
to win a championship,

02:28.409 --> 02:30.846
then you need to sacrifice
being the hero.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.848
[urinating]

02:32.891 --> 02:37.809
I told him that we built the
best Fugitive there's ever been.

02:37.853 --> 02:39.376
His words, not mine.

02:39.420 --> 02:44.642
And now all he needed to do
was trust that team.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.123
[urinating continues]

02:47.167 --> 02:50.344

change today,

be a game five

So, let's be clear. To win,

06:56.067 --> 06:58.461
Fugitive needed a rookie

out of nowhere.

searches far and wide, just...

to the spirit realm

Getting back into it

20:07.206 --> 20:09.556

20:09.599 --> 20:13.255
It's a balance where
you know your players

20:13.299 --> 20:14.604

20:23.874 --> 20:25.354
the difficulty
of the Korean server,

we're gonna win Worlds

it had to be here in Korea,

most impressive accomplishment

27:44.401 --> 27:45.838

27:45.881 --> 27:47.535
I mean, yes, it would be,

27:47.578 --> 27:50.233

after being

-a North American fan for
so long. It's not gonna happen.
-Come on.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.629
I'll say this: if anyone
was gonna make it happen,

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
for North America,
it would be Organizm.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.633
I'm not retiring,
first and foremost.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.375

left in me.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.855
You know, Org's a great player,

28:02.898 --> 28:05.553
but Fugitive's gonna be fine
without him.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.294
You know, I've been playing
the game for a long time,

28:07.337 --> 28:09.296

28:09.339 --> 28:11.037

28:11.080 --> 28:14.997
Um, but I think it just makes me
stronger, ultimately.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.738
And we'll find that next ADC.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.436
A-And you'll see, next season,
we'll be even stronger for it.

this is the right move,

I was never happier

28:55.646 --> 28:57.257

29:03.829 --> 29:06.266
I think becoming
rank one in Korea,

29:06.309 --> 29:09.356
uh, will make me
a better player at this point.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.538
I mean...

29:17.581 --> 29:19.975
I don't know,
maybe, uh, most people

29:20.019 --> 29:22.891
are designed to be happy,

29:22.935 --> 29:25.459
but I don't really think
about it like that, you know?

29:25.502 --> 29:26.808
Um...

29:28.636 --> 29:31.465
All I know for sure
is that, right now,

29:31.508 --> 29:33.815
I'm the worst
that I will ever be at League.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.296
And when you talk to me in three
months, I'll be a better player,

29:36.339 --> 29:39.386
but even in that instance,
I'll still be

29:39.429 --> 29:41.910
the worst player
I'll ever be at League.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.739
So, really,
that's all I can think about.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.611
I mean, it doesn't
make sense for me to...

29:47.655 --> 29:50.310
think about or be happy about

29:50.353 --> 29:52.965
some shit
that I've already done.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.010
CREAMCHEESE:
Here we go!
We brought it home, baby!

29:55.054 --> 29:56.533
[cheering, applause]

29:56.577 --> 29:58.971
-Let's go!
-I love you.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.320
Everybody say "Champions."

30:00.363 --> 30:02.148
ALL:
Champions.

30:03.758 --> 30:06.500
ORGANIZM:
And yeah, I miss
my teammates already.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.676
I miss Creamcheese, of course.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.243
Champions!

30:11.418 --> 30:13.376
All right, I would like,
I would like to get one more.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.204
-CREAMCHEESE: No, we got it,
we got it.
-KYLE: Paul, we got it.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.858
-Yeah, we got it. Thank you.
-KYLE: All right, everyone,

30:16.902 --> 30:18.077
-let's have a good time!
-[cheering, applause]

30:18.120 --> 30:19.165
ORGANIZM:
But right now, there are,

30:19.208 --> 30:21.515
there are players
who are grinding

30:21.558 --> 30:22.864
right now on this server.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.561
There are players
who are grinding

30:24.605 --> 30:27.303
and-and getting better and
better and better and better.

30:27.347 --> 30:31.394
And it's just, like,
I'm-I'm just here,

30:31.438 --> 30:34.963
talking to you, losing ground.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.226
-CREAMCHEESE: Yeah! We got it!
-[cheering, whooping]

30:37.270 --> 30:40.360
-Look at that.
-ORGANIZM: I don't do
what I do to be happy.

30:40.403 --> 30:42.753
I don't do what I do
because I love the game.

30:42.797 --> 30:45.887
I do what I do
because I love to win.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.062
PAUL:
Oh, there he is.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.282
-The champ!
-Do it to me.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.415
ORGANIZM:
It's not about
being the greatest in NA.

30:52.459 --> 30:55.244
It's not about being
the greatest in the world, even.

30:55.288 --> 30:57.856
-You deserve it, man.
-And again, next year, again.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.075
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
-Right, Tyrant? Again.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.816
-And then maybe Worlds.
-Hey, cheers to that.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.731
-TYRANT: Let's go, man.
-Don't know.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.994
ORGANIZM:
For me, it's about
being the greatest of all time.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.823
Like, no question,
nobody can doubt it, you know?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.912
[indistinct chatter]

31:10.956 --> 31:13.872
ORGANIZM:
And so, all I know is,

31:13.915 --> 31:16.918
if you're not pushing yourself
to be better,

31:16.962 --> 31:20.617
and you're just telling yourself
you're happy where you're at,

31:20.661 --> 31:23.272
then in my opinion,

31:23.316 --> 31:26.667
you're just lying to yourself.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.799
-The Yuumi pick, like...
-Yeah.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.540
-...all that coming together?
-Thank you, dude.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.586
-It-it was so cool to watch.
-Thank you.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.327
I-I really
appreciate that, dude.

31:34.370 --> 31:36.329
Seriously.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.505
That's nice to hear.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.730
[sighs]
That was fun, right?

32:00.266 --> 32:02.703
Yuumi the Magical Cat.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.535
It's got to be one of my
all-time favorite cat stories.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.713
In the lore, Yuumi is this

32:12.756 --> 32:15.237
completely illiterate cat,
right?

32:15.281 --> 32:18.588
And she belongs to
the Yordle enchantress Norra.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.721
[mouse clicking]

32:20.764 --> 32:25.030
And one day, Norra disappears,
out of nowhere.

32:26.901 --> 32:30.296
And from that point,
Yuumi searches far and wide,

32:30.339 --> 32:33.908
just yearning to be
reunited with Norra.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.915
Because without Norra...

32:43.570 --> 32:47.574
...Yuumi is just lost.

32:56.235 --> 32:58.237
