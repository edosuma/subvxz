00:01.960 --> 00:03.586
{\an8}<i>- My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:06.005
<i>and I graduated from one of</i>
<i>Canada's top business schools</i>

00:06.089 --> 00:08.299
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:09.926
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:10.009 --> 00:11.636
<i>to help struggling</i>
<i>small business owners make it</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:15.306
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.226
This is "Nathan for You."

00:19.686 --> 00:21.104
<i>Life isn't easy for smokers</i>
<i>these days</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:24.441
<i>as smoking bans</i>
<i>throughout America have made</i>

00:24.524 --> 00:27.485
<i>the outdoors the only option</i>
<i>for lighting up.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:29.779
<i>But hit worst of all</i>
<i>has been the bars.</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.115
<i>And proprietors</i>
<i>like Ellen Sancer</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:34.909
<i>of the 1881 Club</i>
<i>in Pasadena, California,</i>

00:34.993 --> 00:36.453
<i>claim that smoking restrictions</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.371
<i>have caused her profits</i>
<i>to plummet.</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:39.956
{\an8}- We lost a lot
of our customers.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.958
{\an8}Our business went down
by half.

00:42.041 --> 00:45.587
<i>- As a smoker herself,</i>
<i>she's not happy.</i>

00:45.670 --> 00:46.921
<i>So I paid Ellen a visit</i>
<i>with a way</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:51.050
<i>she might be able to return</i>
<i>to those profitable glory days.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:52.469
In my opinion,

00:52.552 --> 00:54.804
smokers shouldn't be treated
like second-class citizens.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.805
- Absolutely.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.432
- If anything,
they should be treated better

00:57.515 --> 01:00.268
than the rest of us because
they're gonna die so young.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.230
- Or at least as well
as the rest of them.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.357
- Right, so you think
people should be allowed

01:06.441 --> 01:07.442
to smoke in here?
- Yeah.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.320
- Well, I might have a way
to make that happen.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.489
- Okay.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.407
<i>- Right now,</i>
<i>California state law</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.786
<i>prohibits smoking in a business</i>
<i>unless it happens to be</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:19.579
<i>part of a theatrical production</i>

01:19.662 --> 01:22.123
<i>where smoking is integral</i>
<i>to the plot.</i>

01:22.207 --> 01:25.001
<i>So if Ellen added a small</i>
<i>audience section to her bar</i>

01:25.084 --> 01:26.669
<i>and then classified</i>
<i>every patron</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.088
<i>as an actor</i>
<i>in a free-form play,</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:32.175
<i>the 1881 Club would become</i>
<i>the only drinking hole in town</i>

01:32.258 --> 01:34.844
<i>where people</i>
<i>could legally smoke.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:36.596
- That could be possible.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.934
I never thought about turning it
around that way.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.060
- Well, most theater
is terrible.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.687
- [laughs] I have seen
a few bad ones, yeah.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
- Yeah, so who's to say
a bar filled with smokers

01:47.440 --> 01:49.776
can't be a boundary-pushing
theatrical experience?

01:49.859 --> 01:53.738
- Right.
- In the eyes of the law.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.864
- It's an idea.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.115
It's definitely an idea.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.701
<i>- Ellen was thrilled</i>
<i>at the prospect</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:01.746
<i>of bringing smokers back</i>
<i>to her bar, so the next day,</i>

02:01.830 --> 02:04.040
<i>I had my team bring in</i>
<i>a couple of theater seats</i>

02:04.123 --> 02:06.084
<i>to create</i>
<i>a small audience section</i>

02:06.167 --> 02:07.877
<i>and then threw up a curtain</i>
<i>to complete</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:09.711
<i>the theater experience.</i>

02:09.795 --> 02:11.422
<i>I also chose a title</i>
<i>for the play,</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.008
<i>"Smokers Allowed"</i>
<i>that would conveniently double</i>

02:14.092 --> 02:16.219
<i>to attract clientele,</i>
<i>then put up a sign on the door</i>

02:16.302 --> 02:19.514
{\an8}<i>informing patrons</i>
<i>that by entering the bar,</i>

02:19.597 --> 02:21.558
{\an8}<i>they're legally agreeing</i>
<i>to be actors</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:22.892
{\an8}<i>in a theatrical production.</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:24.227
<i>So when nighttime came,</i>

02:24.310 --> 02:27.397
<i>I headed to some other bars in</i>
<i>the area to get word spreading</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:29.816
<i>about L.A.'s hottest new</i>
<i>smoking destination.</i>

02:29.899 --> 02:33.319
{\an7}You got to smoke
outside here, huh?

02:33.403 --> 02:36.281
{\an7}Yeah, have you been
to 1881 Club?

02:38.741 --> 02:39.284
{\an8}- They allow you
to smoke there.

02:45.081 --> 02:48.251
{\an8}- Yeah, a loophole.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.961
{\an8}Theater law.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.546
{\an7}Yeah.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.548
<i>- My promotional efforts</i>
<i>seemed to be working...</i>

02:53.631 --> 02:55.884
All right, smokers unite.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.343
<i>Because, within minutes,</i>
<i>customers began arriving</i>

02:57.427 --> 03:02.432
<i>at the 1881 Club for a night</i>
<i>of legal indoor smoking.</i>

03:02.515 --> 03:04.183
<i>As a final precaution,</i>

03:04.267 --> 03:06.436
<i>I had two women recruited</i>
<i>from the theater district</i>

03:06.519 --> 03:09.022
<i>who were interested</i>
<i>in seeing an exciting new play.</i>

03:09.105 --> 03:11.024
So for two?
- For two.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.108
- Okay, you're in luck.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.319
We have two front-row seats
still available.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.612
- Very cool.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.655
<i>- I knew an audience</i>
<i>would be the final piece</i>

03:17.739 --> 03:20.366
<i>to legitimize my production</i>
<i>in the eyes of the law.</i>

03:20.450 --> 03:21.826
<i>So with the women</i>
<i>in their seats,</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:23.870
<i>it was time</i>
<i>to begin the show.</i>

03:23.953 --> 03:25.288
All right, welcome.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.123
{\an1}Thank you so much
for coming.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.752
{\an1}So it took a lot of work to get
this play off the ground.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.961
{\an1}I don't want
to say too much

03:32.045 --> 03:34.464
{\an1}'cause I don't want to spoil
anything, but all I'll say is,

03:34.547 --> 03:39.469
{\an1}I hope you enjoy this as much
as we enjoyed making it.

03:39.552 --> 03:43.431
{\an1}So without further ado,
"Smokers Allowed."

03:45.141 --> 03:48.186
[indistinct chatter]

04:01.991 --> 04:04.827
<i>My plan was working great.</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:07.038
<i>People could now smoke freely</i>
<i>without the bar</i>

04:07.121 --> 04:10.166
<i>having to worry</i>
<i>about any legal repercussions.</i>

04:10.249 --> 04:12.293
<i>And with the audience</i>
<i>shoved away in the corner,</i>

04:12.377 --> 04:15.713
<i>hardly any customers seemed</i>
<i>to notice they were there.</i>

04:15.797 --> 04:19.132
<i>Best of all, I had never seen</i>
<i>Ellen look happier.</i>

04:19.216 --> 04:20.843
<i>So after an hour and 20 minutes</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:22.720
<i>when the bar crowd</i>
<i>started to dwindle,</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:25.181
<i>I decided to close the curtain</i>
<i>and say the play was over.</i>

04:25.264 --> 04:28.059
All right, so that's it.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.519
{\an1}Thank you so much
for coming.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.146
I hope you enjoyed
"Smokers Allowed."

04:32.230 --> 04:33.940
[applause]

04:34.023 --> 04:35.984
<i>It was a successful evening,</i>

04:36.067 --> 04:38.611
<i>but then something happened</i>
<i>that I never expected.</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:41.531
<i>The audience actually</i>
<i>seemed to enjoy the play.</i>

04:41.614 --> 04:42.699
{\an3}- Oh, man,
they were awesome.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.909
- Yeah, yeah, they were.
- They were awesome.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.411
- It's so funny
'cause it's, like,

04:46.494 --> 04:50.873
so nothing in a way
but incredibly profound.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.710
It reminded me
of Sam Shepard.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.670
<i>- I didn't really know</i>
<i>what to make of this.</i>

04:55.753 --> 04:58.172
<i>After all, these ladies</i>
<i>could be total kooks.</i>

04:58.256 --> 04:59.924
<i>But if what happened</i>
<i>in there somehow</i>

05:00.008 --> 05:02.218
<i>had genuine theatrical value,</i>

05:02.301 --> 05:05.638
<i>it could be a whole new source</i>
<i>of revenue for the 1881 Club.</i>

05:05.722 --> 05:07.473
<i>So later that week, I arranged</i>
<i>a meeting with the chair</i>

05:07.557 --> 05:10.393
<i>of the theater department</i>
<i>at Glendale Community College</i>

05:10.476 --> 05:12.186
<i>to find out if I was</i>
<i>actually onto something</i>

05:12.270 --> 05:16.607
<i>with my play,</i>
<i>"Smokers Allowed."</i>

05:16.691 --> 05:20.236
{\an8}- The guy by himself
stands out to me

05:20.319 --> 05:21.571
{\an8}because he looks lonely.

05:21.654 --> 05:26.909
{\an3}The couple stands out to me
because it tells a story

05:26.993 --> 05:27.785
{\an3}that maybe
they're in a new relationship...

05:27.869 --> 05:28.494
- Uh-huh.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.830
- And I think that curiosity

05:30.913 --> 05:33.791
is what makes me want
to continue to watch.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.086
- Do you think
this has theatrical merit?

05:37.170 --> 05:41.257
- Yeah, you know,
this is "slice of life" theater,

05:41.340 --> 05:44.635
and for that aspect,
I think it's important.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.137
- Wow.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.015
<i>I was amazed that Jeanette</i>
<i>saw value in my play...</i>

05:49.098 --> 05:51.309
- It's reminiscent
of playwrights

05:51.392 --> 05:52.977
like John Patrick Shanley.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.188
<i>- And even compared it</i>
<i>to the work of who I assumed</i>

05:55.271 --> 05:57.023
<i>were famous playwrights.</i>

05:57.106 --> 05:59.108
<i>It was clear</i>
<i>something happened that night</i>

05:59.192 --> 06:00.568
<i>that I couldn't ignore.</i>

06:00.651 --> 06:02.779
<i>So the next day,</i>
<i>I returned to the 1881 Club</i>

06:02.862 --> 06:06.991
<i>to see if Ellen was interested</i>
<i>in adjusting our approach.</i>

06:07.075 --> 06:07.992
I don't know what it was,

06:08.076 --> 06:10.453
but people really responded
to this thing.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.080
- I didn't get to pay
much attention.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.206
I was busy.
[laughs]

06:13.289 --> 06:13.998
- I mean,
you can make good money

06:14.082 --> 06:16.000
having people smoke in here.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.043
- Right.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.837
- But you could make millions
with a hit play.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.922
- That's possible, yeah.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.341
- I mean, at this point,

06:23.424 --> 06:24.467
it's hard to know if the play
would actually be a success,

06:24.550 --> 06:28.471
but I think we'd be idiots
not to give it a shot.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.141
- Yeah, we should.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.560
<i>- I was happy to have Ellen</i>
<i>on board with my new plan,</i>

06:34.644 --> 06:35.686
<i>but as I spent the next day</i>

06:35.770 --> 06:36.896
<i>going over the footage</i>
<i>from that night,</i>

06:36.979 --> 06:40.108
<i>I was no closer to figuring out</i>
<i>what made this play</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:41.651
<i>so interesting.</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:44.153
<i>That was until I noticed</i>
<i>a few exciting moments</i>

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
<i>that may have gripped</i>
<i>the audience.</i>

06:46.072 --> 06:48.825
<i>At one table, there was</i>
<i>a couple that shared a kiss,</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:51.452
<i>so I knew there was</i>
<i>a romantic story line.</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:52.620
<i>There was also a moment</i>

06:52.703 --> 06:54.664
<i>where a man</i>
<i>showed off his skateboard deck</i>

06:54.747 --> 06:57.375
<i>while, at the same time,</i>
<i>a three-person selfie</i>

06:57.458 --> 06:58.918
<i>was happening at the bar,</i>

06:59.001 --> 07:01.504
<i>the perfect climactic</i>
<i>action scene.</i>

07:01.587 --> 07:03.005
<i>I didn't see it before,</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:05.842
<i>but this night had all</i>
<i>the ingredients of a hit play.</i>

07:05.925 --> 07:08.970
<i>So I figured the surest way</i>
<i>to guarantee success would be</i>

07:09.053 --> 07:11.556
<i>to re-create every moment</i>
<i>exactly as it happened.</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:15.017
<i>So I spent the afternoon</i>
<i>compiling all the audio</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.186
<i>and video footage</i>
<i>we had from that night</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.856
<i>and then hired a team</i>
<i>of professional transcribers</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:22.692
<i>to write down every word</i>
<i>that was spoken.</i>

07:22.775 --> 07:25.027
<i>It was a lengthy,</i>
<i>multi-day process,</i>

07:25.111 --> 07:27.155
<i>so I tried to make sure</i>
<i>their working environment</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:28.698
<i>was as comfortable</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:30.366
Want some apple juice?

07:30.449 --> 07:31.200
- No.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.120
{\an1}- Do you want
some apple juice?

07:34.203 --> 07:35.580
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Okay, sure.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.873
<i>When the transcription</i>
<i>was finally done,</i>

07:36.956 --> 07:40.960
<i>I had the dialogue compiled</i>
<i>and converted into a script</i>

07:41.043 --> 07:42.920
<i>and then blew up images</i>
<i>from our footage,</i>

07:43.004 --> 07:46.549
<i>so I could cast professional</i>
<i>actors to play each role.</i>

07:46.632 --> 07:47.884
<i>But since it was crucial</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:50.136
<i>that they were able</i>
<i>to embody the exact essence</i>

07:50.219 --> 07:51.429
<i>of the original person,</i>

07:51.512 --> 07:55.224
<i>I set up auditions with my top</i>
<i>picks for later that week.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:56.601
<i>But for Ellen's role,</i>

07:56.684 --> 07:59.145
<i>I thought it would be simplest</i>
<i>if she could just play herself,</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:02.148
<i>so I paid her a visit to see</i>
<i>if she was right for the part.</i>

08:02.231 --> 08:05.234
So you're reading for the role
of female bar owner.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.195
- Okay.
- All right.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.447
Do you want to just slate
with your name first?

08:11.073 --> 08:12.241
- My name's Ellen.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.493
- Okay,
whenever you're ready.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.289
- You did not just say that.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.917
- Yes, he did.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.043
- All right, here you go.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.253
- Thank you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.422
- Excuse me, sweetheart.

08:26.505 --> 08:30.009
- All right, great.
Well, we'll be in touch.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.761
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

08:31.844 --> 08:32.970
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.804
<i>I thought</i>
<i>Ellen did a pretty good job,</i>

08:34.889 --> 08:37.099
<i>but it was only fair</i>
<i>to hold off on my decision</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:40.019
<i>until the rest of the auditions</i>
<i>I had scheduled were done.</i>

08:40.102 --> 08:42.605
{\an1}So you're reading for the part
of bar patron number six.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.688
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.776
- All right,
so whenever you're ready.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.860
- Bud Light, please.

08:51.739 --> 08:52.698
- All right.
- Cool.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.116
- That's great.
You got the part.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.034
- Awesome.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.702
<i>- As more and more actors</i>
<i>came in,</i>

08:56.786 --> 08:58.996
<i>the roles</i>
<i>were filling up nicely,</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:00.456
<i>and I was especially</i>
<i>blown away</i>

09:00.539 --> 09:02.917
<i>by an actress</i>
<i>who nailed the part of Ellen.</i>

09:03.000 --> 09:03.960
- You did not
just say that.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.337
- Yes, he did.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.381
- All right, here you go.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.173
- Thank you.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.676
- Excuse me, sweetheart.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.804
- Wow,
that was really good.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.057
<i>With every role now cast,</i>
<i>I gave all my actors a week</i>

09:18.140 --> 09:20.476
<i>to familiarize themselves</i>
<i>with the script</i>

09:20.559 --> 09:21.477
<i>and then brought them</i>
<i>to a church I rented</i>

09:21.560 --> 09:24.981
<i>for three days</i>
<i>of intense group rehearsal</i>

09:25.064 --> 09:26.816
<i>over a holiday weekend.</i>

09:26.899 --> 09:30.444
So ready and action.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.572
[indistinct chatter]

09:44.208 --> 09:45.334
<i>- It seemed like</i>
<i>most of my actors</i>

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
<i>had a pretty good handle</i>
<i>on their lines,</i>

09:46.919 --> 09:48.421
<i>and with a little bit</i>
<i>of practice,</i>

09:48.504 --> 09:50.464
<i>they were getting</i>
<i>closer to nailing the blocking</i>

09:50.548 --> 09:53.676
{\an3}<i>of key action sequences that</i>
<i>happened on the original night.</i>

09:53.759 --> 09:57.346
<i>But as the rehearsal</i>
<i>went on, I became concerned</i>

09:57.430 --> 10:00.057
<i>about the performances</i>
<i>of my romantic leads.</i>

10:00.141 --> 10:02.476
<i>Their chemistry was the glue</i>
<i>holding this play together,</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:05.563
<i>but so far,</i>
<i>I wasn't buying it.</i>

10:05.646 --> 10:07.815
<i>So after the rest of the group</i>
<i>left that day,</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:11.402
<i>I kept the pair behind to work</i>
<i>with them one on one.</i>

10:11.485 --> 10:13.362
- I'd wanna, like,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.323
{\an3}personally give
your daughter a sibling.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.367
{\an1}Now, I know
she'd be like, "Dad."

10:18.451 --> 10:20.328
{\an3}- I would love
to do that for her.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.748
- I love you.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.333
- I love you too.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.752
- All right, stop.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.463
I really want this
to feel like a real connection,

10:30.546 --> 10:33.674
a real love story
between you guys,

10:33.758 --> 10:36.969
but I'm not getting
that sense right now.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.429
How about we try
an exercise, okay?

10:38.512 --> 10:39.388
{\an3}- Okay.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.681
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.933
- So, Gabriel,
you stand up here.

10:45.394 --> 10:45.770
So let's try this.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.985
{\an3}Look into my eyes and say,
"I love you."

10:53.069 --> 10:54.320
{\an1}- Okay.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.741
I love you.

10:58.824 --> 11:03.120
{\an3}- Okay, now I'm not
believing that at this point,

11:03.204 --> 11:04.955
so say it again.
- Okay.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.083
I love you.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.419
- Again.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.670
- I love you.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.966
- Again.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.219
- I love you.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.764
- Again.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.516
- I love you.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.477
- Again.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.730
- I love you.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.316
- Again.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.110
- I love you.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.198
- Again.
- I love you.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.702
- Again.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.580
- I love you.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.295
- Again.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.713
- I love you.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.011
- Again.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.763
- I love you.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.893
- Again.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.145
- You have tears
in your eyes, so...

12:09.228 --> 12:10.479
- Oh, really?

12:10.563 --> 12:11.814
{\an1}- Yeah.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.109
{\an3}- Oh, my God.
Sorry.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.653
{\an3}Um, okay.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.321
{\an3}See, that--
that felt real to me.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.198
- Good.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.534
- Did it feel more real
when you did it with me

12:23.617 --> 12:24.869
{\an3}than when you did it
with him?

12:24.952 --> 12:28.164
- Um, well,
I did it more times with you.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.874
- Right, but it did?

12:29.957 --> 12:30.833
- Well, so yes, yes.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.502
- Okay, so it did,
more than with him.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.381
{\an3}Okay, so...

12:37.465 --> 12:39.800
You understand?

12:39.884 --> 12:40.843
- Yeah.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.262
- And what did you learn
by watching that?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.848
- That she loves you.

12:45.931 --> 12:50.227
- Well, I mean, she's--
she's acting.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.645
Yeah.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.688
So that's good.
- Yeah.

12:52.771 --> 12:57.109
- So that's what we want
from the scene.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.695
We want that type of connection.
- Okay.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.198
- I mean, does that make sense?
- Yeah.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.159
- Great.
So let's, uh, let's try that.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.535
<i>With my expert guidance</i>

13:06.619 --> 13:08.204
<i>and a few more hours</i>
<i>of rehearsal,</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:11.207
<i>the chemistry between them</i>
<i>was now all too real.</i>

13:11.290 --> 13:12.666
- I love you.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.711
- I love you too.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.088
<i>- With the actors</i>
<i>in good shape,</i>

13:18.172 --> 13:19.632
<i>my crew and I</i>
<i>returned to the 1881 Club</i>

13:19.715 --> 13:21.842
<i>to prepare</i>
<i>for the big premiere.</i>

13:21.926 --> 13:24.678
<i>Along with expanding</i>
<i>the audience section</i>

13:24.762 --> 13:25.846
<i>to seven seats,</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:27.306
<i>I added a selection</i>
<i>of branded merchandise</i>

13:27.389 --> 13:30.059
<i>to maximize our revenue</i>

13:30.142 --> 13:31.602
<i>and increased</i>
<i>the cost of drinks</i>

13:31.685 --> 13:34.146
<i>to reflect theater prices.</i>

13:34.230 --> 13:35.606
<i>And after</i>
<i>a bit of promotion...</i>

13:35.689 --> 13:38.275
{\an3}It's a new play called
"Smokers Allowed."

13:38.359 --> 13:41.362
{\an3}It's kind of
a slice of life.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.155
- Okay.
- Okay, hope to see you there.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.406
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Okay.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.867
<i>It was finally time</i>
<i>for opening night.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:50.746
<i>- I had no idea</i>
<i>if we'd get an audience,</i>

13:50.829 --> 13:51.830
<i>but as show time neared,</i>
<i>it looked like</i>

13:51.914 --> 13:54.208
<i>we might have a sellout</i>
<i>on our hands,</i>

13:54.291 --> 13:55.834
<i>as a line comprised mostly</i>

13:55.918 --> 13:57.545
<i>of family and friends</i>
<i>of the actors</i>

13:57.628 --> 13:59.838
<i>began filling up the seats.</i>

13:59.922 --> 14:03.425
<i>Meanwhile, backstage was abuzz</i>
<i>with my cast running lines</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:05.594
<i>and getting</i>
<i>some final touch-ups.</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:08.430
<i>But before we could begin,</i>
<i>I still had the tough task</i>

14:08.514 --> 14:11.100
<i>that I'd been putting off</i>
<i>of breaking the news to Ellen</i>

14:11.183 --> 14:12.560
<i>that she didn't</i>
<i>get the part.</i>

14:12.643 --> 14:14.937
So opening night.
- Yeah.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.522
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, I am.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.856
I'm looking forward to it.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.443
- Before we begin, I just want
to say your audition was great.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.653
- Thank you.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.613
- Unfortunately, it wasn't quite
what I was looking for,

14:24.697 --> 14:28.367
for the role
of female bar owner.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.451
- Right, no problem.
I understand.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.788
- Okay, so that being said,

14:32.871 --> 14:34.832
I'd like to introduce you
to Amy.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.668
She's the actress
that will be playing you.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.044
- All right.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.798
{\an3}- And I think you'll find
she really honors the character.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.551
Amy, do you want to show her
a bit of your Ellen?

14:47.511 --> 14:50.639
- Nice to see you.
Can I get you a drink?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.308
- Yeah,
that sounds good.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.143
{\an3}- All right,
so you guys want to switch out?

14:54.226 --> 14:55.769
- Okay.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.146
<i>- Even though</i>
<i>Ellen wouldn't be in the play,</i>

14:57.229 --> 14:59.607
<i>I still wanted her</i>
<i>to enjoy the show,</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:01.442
<i>which is why</i>
<i>I had a front-row seat</i>

15:01.525 --> 15:04.194
<i>in the audience reserved</i>
<i>especially for her.</i>

15:04.278 --> 15:06.322
<i>With just a few minutes</i>
<i>until show time,</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:09.241
<i>I had a final look-over</i>
<i>to ensure that every prop</i>

15:09.325 --> 15:12.119
<i>and every actor was</i>
<i>in the exact right position,</i>

15:12.202 --> 15:15.205
<i>and once the scene was set,</i>
<i>we were ready to begin.</i>

15:15.289 --> 15:17.333
Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.918
{\an1}- Thank you--
thank you so much for coming.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.462
We're very excited.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.213
{\an1}I'm always hesitant
to say too much

15:23.297 --> 15:25.257
'cause I don't want
to spoil anything,

15:25.341 --> 15:28.135
{\an1}but I'll just say
I hope you enjoy this play

15:28.218 --> 15:30.095
{\an1}as much as we enjoyed
making it.

15:31.013 --> 15:36.185
{\an1}So, without further ado,
"Smokers Allowed."

15:36.268 --> 15:39.688
[applause]

15:39.772 --> 15:42.816
[indistinct chatter]

16:06.131 --> 16:07.758
<i>- It was</i>
<i>such an amazing feeling</i>

16:07.841 --> 16:10.969
<i>to see my play finally launch,</i>
<i>and 20 minutes in,</i>

16:11.053 --> 16:13.764
{\an8}<i>it was clear</i>
<i>our rehearsals had paid off,</i>

16:13.847 --> 16:17.184
{\an8}<i>as my actors were able to stay</i>
<i>faithful to the original night,</i>

16:17.267 --> 16:18.894
{\an8}<i>matching the dialogue</i>
<i>and actions</i>

16:18.977 --> 16:20.979
{\an8}<i>as closely as possible.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:22.189
{\an1}- But instead
I stay at home,

16:22.272 --> 16:24.692
{\an1}and I watch "The Real Housewives
of New York City."

16:24.775 --> 16:25.859
Have you ever seen that?

16:25.943 --> 16:27.403
<i>- And I could sense</i>
<i>that the audience</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:30.072
<i>was really connecting</i>
<i>with their performance.</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
<i>My romantic leads</i>
<i>had finally found a chemistry</i>

16:32.908 --> 16:34.910
{\an8}<i>that felt as genuine</i>
<i>as the love</i>

16:34.993 --> 16:37.496
{\an8}<i>that real-life couple</i>
<i>they were playing shared.</i>

16:39.039 --> 16:40.582
{\an8}<i>But all this</i>
<i>would mean nothing</i>

16:40.666 --> 16:43.001
<i>if the play's climax</i>
<i>didn't land,</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:44.253
<i>the guy showing off</i>
<i>his skateboard deck</i>

16:44.336 --> 16:48.507
<i>while a three-person selfie</i>
<i>happened at the same time.</i>

16:48.590 --> 16:50.592
<i>The audience was on the edge</i>
<i>of their seats,</i>

16:50.676 --> 16:52.928
<i>craving something to put this</i>
<i>over the top,</i>

16:53.011 --> 16:57.307
<i>and I'm happy to say</i>
<i>we delivered.</i>

16:57.391 --> 17:01.145
<i>It was a strong first showing</i>
<i>for the entire cast,</i>

17:01.228 --> 17:03.772
<i>and I was hopeful this would be</i>
<i>a real money-maker</i>

17:03.856 --> 17:05.898
<i>for the 1881 Club.</i>

17:05.983 --> 17:08.026
<i>So once the play was done</i>
<i>and the cast took their bows,</i>

17:08.109 --> 17:10.529
<i>I felt compelled</i>
<i>to express my gratitude</i>

17:10.612 --> 17:12.948
<i>for everyone's support.</i>

17:13.031 --> 17:15.075
[applause]

17:18.037 --> 17:19.038
Ah.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.290
Thank you so much
for coming out.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.790
On behalf of the cast
and myself,

17:22.875 --> 17:27.463
we're so amazed
at this turnout.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.381
Now even though
a lot of the characters

17:29.465 --> 17:31.759
you saw in the play tonight
were smoking,

17:31.842 --> 17:32.926
it's important
to remember that smoking

17:33.010 --> 17:36.180
does kill over 400,000 Americans
per year.

17:36.263 --> 17:40.309
Another 8.6 million
live with a serious illness

17:40.392 --> 17:43.061
that was caused by smoking
or secondhand smoke.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.147
So think before you light up.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.733
Thank you so much
for coming out, and good night.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.861
[cheers and applause]

17:53.822 --> 17:55.991
<i>My play was</i>
<i>a bona fide success,</i>

17:56.074 --> 17:57.868
<i>and I was so proud of my cast</i>

17:57.951 --> 17:58.827
<i>for giving</i>
<i>such a memorable performance</i>

17:58.911 --> 18:01.497
<i>the audience</i>
<i>would never forget.</i>

18:01.580 --> 18:04.333
- I would probably not
recommend it to anybody

18:04.416 --> 18:06.502
as far as saying
it's a really good show.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.715
{\an8}<i>- The response</i>
<i>was overwhelming,</i>

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
<i>but the only opinion that</i>
<i>really mattered was Ellen's.</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:15.302
<i>So once the bar cleared out,</i>

18:15.385 --> 18:18.388
<i>I nervously checked in with her</i>
<i>to get her thoughts.</i>

18:18.472 --> 18:21.558
So, um...

18:21.642 --> 18:24.853
what did you think
of the play?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.063
- It was okay.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.689
It was a little boring as far
as I was concerned, but...

18:27.773 --> 18:30.609
- So you didn't like it?

18:30.692 --> 18:31.902
- Not particularly.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.696
It wasn't--it just wasn't--

18:34.780 --> 18:35.906
they were
just sitting there.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.534
Nobody was really
doing anything.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.119
- So does that mean you're not
going to keep doing it here?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.204
- I doubt it.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.664
Seriously doubt it.

18:43.747 --> 18:47.209
Our customers come in here

somebody sit there smoking.
