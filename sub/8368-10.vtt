a snake and a crocodile.</i>

10:04.394 --> 10:06.395
So I want it to sort of have
this harder, like,

10:06.429 --> 10:10.632
armored texture, but smaller
like a snake-scale pattern.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.334
I texture half of it

10:12.368 --> 10:14.169
<i>so Mr. Westmore can see
the direction I'm going in,</i>

10:14.203 --> 10:16.138
<i>so I can get better feedback
from him.</i>

10:16.172 --> 10:18.173
I like how it looks.
I'm pretty happy with it.

10:18.207 --> 10:19.708
Oh, it's so pretty.

10:19.742 --> 10:21.643
That's actually really,
really cool.

10:21.678 --> 10:23.578
Thank you...
got a lot of texturing to do.

10:23.613 --> 10:26.181
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

10:29.552 --> 10:30.952
Hey, guys, we're here
to check in on you.

10:30.987 --> 10:32.254
- How are you?
- Good.

10:32.288 --> 10:33.722
All: Hi.

10:33.756 --> 10:35.724
Okay, this is your eye that
you picked for your cyclops...

10:35.758 --> 10:36.858
That's my eye.

10:36.893 --> 10:40.729
So this is basically
Satan's blacksmith.

10:40.763 --> 10:45.067
This here should be
a little longer than this side,

10:45.101 --> 10:47.569
and it should have more of
a little bit of a droop to it.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.570
Yeah.

10:48.604 --> 10:49.571
Otherwise, this is looking like

10:49.605 --> 10:50.572
it's just sitting right there.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.606
Right.

10:51.641 --> 10:53.442
As opposed to being
built into the head

10:53.476 --> 10:54.776
and having the weight to it.

10:54.811 --> 10:56.044
Okay.

10:56.079 --> 10:57.345
I went with this one

10:57.380 --> 11:00.182
'cause I really liked
the paint scheme of it,

11:00.216 --> 11:02.884
and I want him to be
the son of Hades.

11:02.919 --> 11:04.186
<i>He's gonna be a demigod,</i>

11:04.220 --> 11:06.888
<i>so I want him to have
some humanoid features.</i>

11:06.923 --> 11:10.192
What color are you going
to get into for skin tone?

11:10.226 --> 11:11.593
I want the purples to pop,

11:11.627 --> 11:14.730
so I was thinking more
of an off-white, almost beige.

11:14.764 --> 11:17.032
Or even get into
a very pale lavender,

11:17.066 --> 11:18.166
which you have in your eye...

11:18.201 --> 11:19.768
Oh, yeah, that might
look cool as well.

11:19.802 --> 11:20.902
I think that
would work wonderful.

11:20.937 --> 11:21.903
Mm-hmm.

11:21.938 --> 11:23.338
This was the eye that I chose.

11:23.372 --> 11:26.241
It had a reptile-aquatic
feel to it,

11:26.275 --> 11:27.542
<i>so I'm going for the cyclops</i>

11:27.577 --> 11:29.111
<i>that forged Poseidon's trident.</i>

11:29.145 --> 11:31.012
I think if you make
your mouth bigger...

11:31.047 --> 11:32.280
Okay.

11:32.315 --> 11:33.548
Extend your lines
of your mouth...

11:33.583 --> 11:35.383
- almost like a fish mouth.
- Yeah.

11:35.418 --> 11:36.952
Go ahead and do...
give some power to it.

11:36.986 --> 11:40.122
And then, with your eye,
you've closed it up.

11:40.156 --> 11:41.823
- Widen 'em up?
- Yeah, widen it out.

11:41.858 --> 11:43.058
- Okay.
- Open it up a little bit.

11:43.092 --> 11:44.326
- Cool, thank you.
- Good luck to you.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.560
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:45.595 --> 11:48.563
So I got a pretty
humanoid-looking eyeball.

11:48.598 --> 11:51.299
<i>I want to create
a dog-human hybrid,</i>

11:51.334 --> 11:53.602
but I just don't want the judges
to question why I have,

11:53.636 --> 11:55.637
like, a human eye
in a dog makeup.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.639
I think it has
a great fantasy to it,

11:57.673 --> 11:59.908
- without even saying "dog."
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.942 --> 12:02.277
I would be concerned
with you painting the nose black

12:02.311 --> 12:03.678
- and making it a dog...
- It'd look silly?

12:03.713 --> 12:04.913
- Yeah.
- Right.

12:04.947 --> 12:06.448
This is the eye I picked.

12:06.482 --> 12:08.116
I was thinking
it was more lizard-like.

12:08.151 --> 12:09.651
Mm-hmm.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.487
What I see, even more so
than a lizard, is a dragon.

12:12.522 --> 12:14.890
- I am okay with that.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:14.924 --> 12:16.892
I think it looks good.
What about color?

12:16.926 --> 12:18.860
<i>I was thinking
a darker overall color,</i>

12:18.895 --> 12:21.163
and then having bright areas,
like a poisonous snake.

12:21.197 --> 12:25.066
The thing is, your detailing
you're doing here is so delicate

12:25.101 --> 12:27.903
that any dark colors,
you're gonna...

12:27.937 --> 12:29.471
- Gonna lose it?
- Yeah, you're wasting time.

12:29.505 --> 12:32.240
But with a lighter base color,

12:32.275 --> 12:34.309
it'll make everything
pop right out.

12:34.343 --> 12:36.344
- Okay, that sounds really cool.
- Yeah.

12:36.379 --> 12:37.412
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

12:37.446 --> 12:38.446
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

12:38.481 --> 12:39.447
- Thank you.
- Bye.

12:39.482 --> 12:40.882
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.388
<i>So Mr. Westmore
highly recommended</i>

12:46.422 --> 12:48.590
<i>I don't go hard
in the dog direction,</i>

12:48.624 --> 12:51.159
because he didn't want it
to look goofy onstage.

12:51.194 --> 12:55.263
<i>So I open the eye more and try
and make it very wrinkly.</i>

12:55.298 --> 12:57.732
<i>And I try bringing
the jowls down</i>

12:57.767 --> 13:00.335
<i>in a more soft and organic
alien way,</i>

13:00.369 --> 13:05.207
because I'm trying to avoid
making it more dog than it is.

13:05.241 --> 13:08.610
<i>[energetic music]</i>

13:08.644 --> 13:11.980
<i>I want to do quills that go
up the sides of the head,</i>

13:12.014 --> 13:14.082
similar to how
Predator has quills.

13:14.116 --> 13:15.550
<i>So I grab some feathers,</i>

13:15.585 --> 13:17.819
<i>and I strip 'em down...
take off the feather part...</i>

13:17.854 --> 13:20.188
<i>so that I'm just left with
the middle of the feather,</i>

13:20.223 --> 13:22.123
<i>which is the quill.</i>

13:22.158 --> 13:23.725
<i>It looks scary and menacing,</i>

13:23.759 --> 13:25.694
<i>and he looks like
he's from the underworld,</i>

13:25.728 --> 13:28.129
<i>so I'm really liking the look.</i>

13:31.968 --> 13:35.704
I'm not 100% happy
with the facial sculpt.

13:35.738 --> 13:39.641
<i>I'm really struggling with
the anatomy around the eye.</i>

13:39.675 --> 13:41.142
Struggling with these eye folds.

13:41.177 --> 13:42.477
It's driving me nuts.

13:42.511 --> 13:45.513
Take that up,
'cause when you do that,

13:45.548 --> 13:47.682
your eyebrow becomes
a lot more square.

13:47.717 --> 13:50.085
Does it?
When I squish it?

13:50.119 --> 13:51.519
Like, see all those
square shapes?

13:51.554 --> 13:53.588
So this needs to be
more squared off.

13:53.623 --> 13:57.792
Rob gives me some helpful tips
on squaring out the brow,

13:57.827 --> 13:59.327
'cause I had it pointed.

13:59.362 --> 14:02.931
<i>So I'm really trying to focus
in on my own anatomy</i>

14:02.965 --> 14:05.400
to make this character work.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.369
It's hard, like,
flipping your brain.

14:07.403 --> 14:09.104
- Yup, it's weird...
- It's, like, really hard.

14:09.138 --> 14:11.239
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

14:12.441 --> 14:14.843
- What is happening?
- Hmm?

14:14.877 --> 14:16.745
I just cannot see the symmetry.

14:16.779 --> 14:18.146
<i>After taking to Yvonne,</i>

14:18.180 --> 14:20.282
<i>I realize that I'm having
some difficulties too.</i>

14:20.316 --> 14:22.183
I have to do this on this side,

14:22.218 --> 14:25.420
and I can't... see it.

14:25.454 --> 14:28.189
The halves of my sculpture
aren't lining up correctly.

14:28.224 --> 14:29.624
<i>The symmetry is off.</i>

14:29.659 --> 14:32.627
This side needs to come
forward like that,

14:32.662 --> 14:34.362
'cause this side's
pushing out more.

14:34.397 --> 14:35.363
- Closer?
- Yeah.

14:35.398 --> 14:36.765
Hmm, you're right.

14:36.799 --> 14:39.334
Because I've been Top Looks
so many times in a row,

14:39.368 --> 14:41.503
<i>I do feel a lot
of pressure right now.</i>

14:41.537 --> 14:44.706
And on top of that, I want
this face piece to be perfect.

14:44.740 --> 14:47.042
And right now, it's not.

14:53.416 --> 14:55.917
<i>I finish my face sculpt
and, from there,</i>

14:55.952 --> 14:57.986
<i>I sculpt out
my flat, textured piece</i>

14:58.020 --> 14:59.854
that I can apply
to the back of the head.

14:59.889 --> 15:03.325
Since I'm only doing a bald cap,
once I'm done with this,

15:03.359 --> 15:05.226
<i>I take my pieces
to the mold room</i>

15:12.401 --> 15:13.435
<i>really feels good,</i>

15:13.469 --> 15:15.570
especially considering
last challenge,

15:15.604 --> 15:17.973
I was stuck in the mold room
with seconds to go.

15:23.746 --> 15:25.847
You happy with it?

15:25.881 --> 15:28.049
[laughing]
All right, then.

15:28.084 --> 15:29.718
I don't really
like my sculpture.

15:29.752 --> 15:31.186
I want to make it less jowly.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.088
I want him
to look more menacing.

15:33.122 --> 15:34.589
<i>But I don't have time,</i>

15:34.623 --> 15:36.458
so I just have to start molding.

15:36.492 --> 15:38.159
<i>Because this is
a Focus Challenge,</i>

15:38.194 --> 15:40.428
<i>I want to make sure
I have a great mold</i>

15:40.463 --> 15:43.064
and a prosthetic
with razor-thin edges.

15:43.099 --> 15:45.433
<i>So I decide to use
a clay extruder.</i>

15:45.468 --> 15:48.269
<i>It's basically the same tool
you use as a kid</i>

15:48.304 --> 15:50.138
<i>when you're playing with clay
and you're making spaghetti...</i>

15:50.172 --> 15:51.473
<i>same idea.</i>

15:51.507 --> 15:52.707
<i>But what's great about
a clay extruder is,</i>

15:52.742 --> 15:55.643
you can send out
a triangular-shaped form

15:55.678 --> 15:57.345
<i>that you can use
as you're fleshing,</i>

15:57.380 --> 15:59.781
<i>and it helps create
a really even edge</i>

15:59.815 --> 16:03.118
all around your piece,
so that your edges are perfect.

16:10.393 --> 16:13.128
Oh, my God... can you please look
at this for two seconds?

16:13.162 --> 16:14.529
Mm-hmm.

16:14.563 --> 16:17.198
I'm driving myself nuts

16:17.233 --> 16:18.433
I just...

16:18.467 --> 16:20.602
The hardest part
of this character

16:20.636 --> 16:22.570
is that it is unfamiliar anatomy

16:22.605 --> 16:24.339

worked with before.

16:24.373 --> 16:26.307

It's like, so hard to make
an expression on a cyclops.

16:29.445 --> 16:31.312
- Yeah.
- Way harder than I thought.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.581
And it's driving me
fucking nuts.

29:45.103 --> 29:47.304
Yeah, he can move pretty well.

29:47.338 --> 29:51.909
This is an unbelievable
amount of work.

29:51.943 --> 29:53.110
It's staggering.

29:53.144 --> 29:54.811
Look at how many
different colors are used

29:54.846 --> 29:56.747
to break up the scale pattern.

29:56.781 --> 29:59.383
You've got two or three colors
within a single scale.

29:59.417 --> 30:00.684
Very cool.

30:01.853 --> 30:05.155
There are some strange shapes
going on here...

30:05.190 --> 30:07.591
just not that keen
on these jowls.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.893
It feels like
it was a bit inspired by

30:09.928 --> 30:11.261
a dog, maybe?

30:11.296 --> 30:13.063
Like a cyclopean Droopy dog.

30:13.097 --> 30:15.465
And what's missing from this
is good sense of anatomy

30:15.500 --> 30:18.835
around the eyeball itself,
and no orbital cavity.

30:20.538 --> 30:24.041
The wrinkles going from
the lower eyelid into the nose

30:24.075 --> 30:25.475
don't make any sense.

30:25.510 --> 30:26.810
With the folds in the skin,

30:26.844 --> 30:29.246
you think about the makeup
rather than the creature.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.815
<i>I see the judges pointing
fingers and looking at things,</i>

30:31.849 --> 30:34.885
which makes me more nervous
than I have been so far.

30:34.919 --> 30:36.853
Can you turn for us, please?

30:36.888 --> 30:39.356
<i>I'm starting to feel like
I'm not gonna be on top.</i>

30:41.159 --> 30:43.327
I really don't want to go home.

30:45.697 --> 30:47.297
All right, guys,
it's time to get on Twitter

30:47.332 --> 30:49.433
and tell us who made
your favorite cyclops

30:49.467 --> 30:51.368
using #FaceOff

30:55.501 --> 30:56.835
With the folds in the skin,

30:56.869 --> 30:58.804
you think about the makeup
rather than the creature.

30:58.838 --> 31:01.506
<i>I see the judges pointing
fingers and looking at things,</i>

31:01.541 --> 31:02.908
which makes me a little worried.

31:02.942 --> 31:04.209
Turn for us, please.

31:07.580 --> 31:08.980
I'm just hoping I'm safe.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.819
Wow.

31:13.853 --> 31:15.687
It actually looks better
without the hood on.

31:15.721 --> 31:17.489
- Beautiful color combinations.
- Yeah!

31:17.523 --> 31:20.625
He really let that eye
inspire all the design choices.

31:20.660 --> 31:21.760
I think it looks cool.

31:21.794 --> 31:24.129
It looks regal and scary
at the same time.

31:24.163 --> 31:26.131
Yeah.
Thanks.

31:31.103 --> 31:33.805
Okay, the judges would like
to hear from each of you

31:33.840 --> 31:35.540
before making their decisions.

31:35.575 --> 31:37.375
Yvonne, you're up first.

31:43.216 --> 31:44.783
- Hi, Yvonne.
- Hi.

31:44.817 --> 31:48.320
Tell us how your eye inspired
this cyclopean character.

31:48.354 --> 31:50.856
Well, basically,
since I saw the red,

31:50.890 --> 31:52.891
I thought of
a demon-like character.

31:52.925 --> 31:56.995
So basically,
he's Satan's blacksmith.

31:57.029 --> 32:00.866
I think he's successful
in terms of the approach.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.001
It's a good shot
at a traditional cyclops,

32:03.035 --> 32:05.303
but I'm not crazy
about the horns.

32:05.338 --> 32:08.073
And I also think
that he really begs

32:08.107 --> 32:10.609
for a lot more
flesh-painting techniques.

32:10.643 --> 32:11.843
I agree.

32:11.878 --> 32:13.678
Your eyeball is the only one

32:13.713 --> 32:15.847
that isn't really standing out
from the makeup.

32:15.882 --> 32:17.382
- It's in a little bit too far.
- Right.

32:17.416 --> 32:19.651
So that's probably
my main criticism.

32:19.685 --> 32:21.753
But I think this makeup
is very clean.

32:21.787 --> 32:23.288
I think you did
a really great job

32:23.322 --> 32:25.624
with your application.

32:25.658 --> 32:27.959
You did a really beautiful job
on his mouth.

32:27.994 --> 32:30.862
But what concerns me, though,
is it's a cyclops challenge.

32:30.897 --> 32:34.065
So it feels like your eye...
the focus of this challenge...

32:34.100 --> 32:35.967
could've done with
a little bit more attention.

32:36.002 --> 32:37.302
I agree, yeah.

32:37.336 --> 32:38.737
I really appreciated
the movement

32:38.771 --> 32:41.139
that he was able to do
with the mouth.

32:41.173 --> 32:42.841
Being an actor, it's really nice

32:42.875 --> 32:45.977
when you can actually move
your face and actually perform.

32:46.012 --> 32:48.446
- I thought that was really cool.
- Thank you.

32:48.481 --> 32:50.615
Yvonne, you can step back.

32:50.650 --> 32:52.751
Thank you.

32:56.822 --> 32:58.490
Rob, please step to the center.

33:05.431 --> 33:06.531
Hi, Rob.
Please tell us

33:06.566 --> 33:08.833
how that beautiful
blue eyeball you got

33:08.868 --> 33:10.235
inspired this makeup.

33:10.269 --> 33:12.170
The pupil and the color
reminded me

33:12.204 --> 33:13.605
of something more aquatic,

33:13.639 --> 33:17.008
so my cyclops was the one
who crafted Poseidon's trident.

33:17.043 --> 33:20.011
I really like this makeup.

33:20.046 --> 33:21.680
Would you mind taking
the hood down for us?

33:21.714 --> 33:23.248
Sure.

33:23.282 --> 33:24.382
Very nice.

33:24.417 --> 33:26.084
I especially like
your color choices.

33:26.118 --> 33:27.752
I think the sculpting
is beautiful.

33:27.787 --> 33:29.354
It's just really a nice job.

33:29.388 --> 33:30.622
Thank you.

33:30.656 --> 33:33.391
You achieve
a holy trinity of design...

33:33.426 --> 33:36.227
a really strong silhouette,
really unique forms,

33:36.262 --> 33:39.030
and then strong graphics
on top of that.

33:39.065 --> 33:40.532
It's a pretty remarkable makeup.

33:40.566 --> 33:41.666
Thank you.

33:41.701 --> 33:43.902
I was really impressed
with your color choices.

33:43.936 --> 33:45.904
That's the first thing
I noticed.

33:45.938 --> 33:47.572
I think you did
a really amazing job.

33:47.607 --> 33:49.007
Thank you.

33:49.041 --> 33:50.642
Rob, please head back.

33:55.014 --> 33:57.382
Walter, please step forward.

34:05.324 --> 34:06.658
- Hi, Walter.
- Hi, guys.

34:06.692 --> 34:09.226
Tell us about your cyclopean
character, please.

34:09.261 --> 34:13.264
I wanted him to be
a son of Hades

34:13.299 --> 34:15.667
and the watcher
of the underworld.

34:15.701 --> 34:17.002
It was a good attempt,

34:17.036 --> 34:20.538
but I think you
could've done better.

34:20.572 --> 34:24.842
The fact that you've accentuated
the entire orbital ridge,

34:24.877 --> 34:27.145
it frames the bags
under the eyes

34:27.179 --> 34:30.982
and showcases what you're trying
to make discreet.

34:31.016 --> 34:32.951
Being that this
was a Focus Challenge,

34:32.985 --> 34:35.152
I think the time management
and the decision-making

34:35.187 --> 34:37.088
to spend so much time
on the body

34:37.123 --> 34:39.524
is what left you lacking
with the facial detail.

34:39.558 --> 34:40.891
Mm-hmm.

34:40.926 --> 34:42.226
My only comment to you,

34:42.261 --> 34:44.094
especially about the color
palette, would be the fact

34:44.130 --> 34:45.797
that the body came out
a little bit more lavender

34:45.831 --> 34:47.331
than the face did.

34:47.366 --> 34:50.368
But I think that also could've
been helped by a darker tone

34:50.402 --> 34:52.170
to help you accentuate
and disguise

34:52.204 --> 34:55.639
some of the areas
that you were trying to hide.

34:55.675 --> 34:57.709
Walter, thank you.
You can head back.

34:57.743 --> 34:58.743
Thanks, Jeffrey.

35:02.281 --> 35:03.948
Melissa,
please step to the center.

35:09.789 --> 35:11.289
[sighs]

35:11.323 --> 35:13.224
- Hey, Melissa.
- Hi.

35:13.259 --> 35:14.726
Tell me a little bit
about your cyclops.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.294
This is Gornak.

35:16.328 --> 35:17.762
- You gave him a name!
- Yes.

35:17.797 --> 35:20.765
He's a Berserker Barbarian,
Level 10,

35:20.800 --> 35:24.903
and he has a +5 armor rating,
due to his Draconian father.

35:24.937 --> 35:29.808
And he has a -10 dexterity,
because of his cyclopean vision,

35:29.842 --> 35:31.676
which hampers
his depth perception.

35:31.711 --> 35:33.244
I love that.

35:33.279 --> 35:35.947
It's really impressive.

35:35.981 --> 35:40.652
I really love the holes
on the side of your cyclops.

35:40.686 --> 35:42.954
I was really appreciative
that it could look so cool,

35:42.988 --> 35:45.390
and the actor
could have so much vision.

35:45.424 --> 35:46.658
Thank you.

35:46.692 --> 35:48.393
I think it was absolutely
brilliant to embrace

35:48.427 --> 35:51.563
the evolutionary relationship
between birds and reptiles.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.399
And then the sheer amount of
work that you have done here

35:54.433 --> 35:57.268
is, to all of us, mind-numbing.

35:57.303 --> 36:00.371
To have gone in
and then really made use

36:00.406 --> 36:02.273
of the scales that you sculpted

36:02.308 --> 36:04.976
by accentuating them
with the paint...

36:05.010 --> 36:07.579
unbelievable.

36:07.613 --> 36:10.148
All I can say is,
like, "Wow, dude."

36:10.182 --> 36:13.351
The complexity of this makeup
is, like, beyond the beyond.

36:13.385 --> 36:15.787
I'm totally blown away
today, honey.

36:15.821 --> 36:17.388
Thank you.

36:17.423 --> 36:19.090
Melissa, you can step back.

36:22.228 --> 36:25.096
- Great job.
- Thank you.

36:25.131 --> 36:26.598
Mel, please step up.

36:32.104 --> 36:34.639
Mel, tell us about
your cyclops character.

36:34.673 --> 36:36.374
It's a future society,

36:36.408 --> 36:39.444
and they've developed
this cyclops-animal hybrid army

36:39.478 --> 36:41.579
to defend the war gods.

36:41.614 --> 36:44.282
What is the animal
in your back story?

36:44.316 --> 36:49.087
I used a dog to reference
some of the nose and the folds.

36:49.121 --> 36:52.290
For me, the character
has major issues

36:52.324 --> 36:55.693
in terms of its development.

36:55.728 --> 36:58.229
It seems like it's too many
different ideas,

36:58.264 --> 36:59.664
and you didn't have enough time.

36:59.698 --> 37:01.666
And there's some issues
technically

37:01.700 --> 37:04.736
how your forms worked out.

37:04.770 --> 37:06.204
You chose a human eye,

37:06.238 --> 37:08.807
and by showing
that much white of the eye,

37:08.841 --> 37:11.843
it feels like
the character's going, "Huh?"

37:11.877 --> 37:17.348
And then you add the jowls
and... it got so silly.

37:17.383 --> 37:20.051
I'm nicer than them.
Don't worry.

37:20.085 --> 37:22.086
Despite the problems
that you had,

37:22.121 --> 37:24.122
I still think that
there's an interesting idea

37:24.156 --> 37:25.790
at the root
of what you were going for.

37:25.825 --> 37:27.325
So I like your cyclops.

37:27.359 --> 37:28.793
Thank you.

37:28.828 --> 37:30.228
Mel, please step back.

37:36.135 --> 37:37.802
It's all right.

37:37.837 --> 37:39.571
All right, guys, please
head back to the makeup room

37:39.605 --> 37:40.972
while the judges deliberate.

37:41.006 --> 37:42.407
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:47.112 --> 37:48.079
All right, judges.

37:48.113 --> 37:49.314
So, just as a reminder,

37:49.348 --> 37:51.616
you do still have your
special immunity on the table,

37:51.650 --> 37:54.285
if you'd like to save someone
from elimination tonight.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.120
So with that, why don't we
talk about tonight's looks?

37:56.155 --> 37:57.455
Why don't we start with Rob?

37:57.489 --> 37:59.691
<i>What I liked most
about Rob's effort here</i>

37:59.725 --> 38:03.895
<i>is his ability to sculpt
beautiful and elegant forms,</i>

38:03.929 --> 38:05.597
but in a shorter time frame.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.065
Yeah, it was quite
beautifully done,

38:07.099 --> 38:11.202
and I love how that blue eye
was piercing out of that makeup.

38:11.237 --> 38:12.470
<i>It was totally bitchin'.</i>

38:12.504 --> 38:14.739
He seemed to have a really
clear, confident vision,

38:14.773 --> 38:16.741
and it sort of came
through in his work, I thought.

38:16.775 --> 38:17.909
I agree.

38:17.943 --> 38:19.978
All right,
let's move on to Melissa.

38:20.012 --> 38:21.679
<i>How the heck
did she get all that done?</i>

38:21.714 --> 38:22.947
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

38:22.982 --> 38:24.849
<i>Better than anything
she has done to date.</i>

38:24.884 --> 38:26.417
<i>It is next-level</i>

38:26.452 --> 38:27.886
to have three or four
different colored scales,

38:27.920 --> 38:30.889
<i>and some of the scales,
three colors to break it up.</i>

38:30.923 --> 38:32.257
<i>It was just gorgeous.</i>

38:32.291 --> 38:34.425
The makeup was so cool
and intricate,

38:34.460 --> 38:35.894
and I could just see him
set-ready

38:35.928 --> 38:37.362
to do something really badass.

38:37.396 --> 38:39.931
All right,
let's move on to Yvonne.

38:39.965 --> 38:42.667
<i>It's a very traditional
type of cyclops.</i>

38:42.701 --> 38:46.871
And because of those simple
choices, I did like this.

38:46.906 --> 38:48.640
I don't think
it's nearly as sophisticated

38:48.674 --> 38:50.441
<i>as some of the other offerings
this week.</i>

38:50.476 --> 38:52.543
<i>But I think it was
a really clean makeup,</i>

38:52.578 --> 38:53.978
and she got the job done.

38:54.013 --> 38:55.346
- The edges were great too.
- Yeah.

38:55.381 --> 38:57.982
All right,
let's move on to Walter.

38:58.017 --> 38:59.450
<i>As far as the paint scheme goes,</i>

38:59.485 --> 39:01.686
<i>I think he could've
had a little bit more depth</i>

39:01.720 --> 39:03.154
<i>in some of the areas
on the face,</i>

39:03.188 --> 39:04.789
which would've helped
with some of the sculpture

39:04.823 --> 39:06.524
that we think
was a little lacking.

39:06.558 --> 39:08.226
Being that it was
a Focus Challenge,

39:08.260 --> 39:12.163
my concern was just how scruffy
the sculptural work was,

39:12.197 --> 39:13.665
<i>particularly in the detailing.</i>

39:13.699 --> 39:16.567
It doesn't have the normal
cohesion of his design work.

39:16.602 --> 39:18.569
All right, let's move on to Mel.

39:18.604 --> 39:20.705
<i>I was disappointed
in Mel's makeup tonight.</i>

39:20.739 --> 39:22.140
<i>It was boring.</i>

39:22.174 --> 39:23.508
<i>I think the eyeball
bulged too much</i>

39:23.542 --> 39:24.876
<i>and made it look silly.</i>

39:24.910 --> 39:27.612
The paint job was mundane.
It was bizarre.

39:27.646 --> 39:29.180
I think she was maybe even
more disappointed

39:29.214 --> 39:30.782
in herself than you were.

39:30.816 --> 39:33.017
That at least speaks to the fact

39:33.052 --> 39:34.852

All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:40.526 --> 39:41.592
- We have.
- Yep.

39:41.627 --> 39:43.061
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:55.140 --> 39:58.776
Rob, you made great
anatomical choices

39:58.811 --> 40:00.144
in terms of how the eye

40:00.179 --> 40:01.713
was incorporated
within the sculpture.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.015
And we really like
how you let its color

40:04.049 --> 40:05.817
dictate the graphic paint work.

40:05.851 --> 40:08.419
Melissa, we were very impressed

40:08.454 --> 40:10.388
with your complex
sculpting and painting,

40:10.422 --> 40:12.924
and you clearly
made a lot of smart decisions

40:12.958 --> 40:14.726

your time management.

Walter, the color palette

41:24.436 --> 41:26.203
and overall character design
are pretty cool,

41:26.238 --> 41:28.506
but there's some sculptural

everything down.
