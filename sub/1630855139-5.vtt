00:32.490 --> 00:34.784
And I can't keep waiting to
meet the right girl, you know?

00:34.826 --> 00:36.536
I gotta take action.
I gotta take charge.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.663
I gotta do this myself
'cause it's for me, right?

00:38.705 --> 00:41.541
So I just...

00:41.583 --> 00:43.209
think I'm ready
to have a little Petey.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.502
What do you think?

00:44.544 --> 00:46.087
You're getting very good
at this.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.508
I almost believed

00:50.550 --> 00:52.844
that you believed the line
of shit you were giving me.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.180
Is it that crazy
that I want to be a dad?

00:55.221 --> 00:56.639
- Yeah, Peter.
- Why?

00:56.681 --> 00:59.434
Because every guy
who has a family,

00:59.476 --> 01:01.394
he's fuckin' fantasizing
about having your life.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.812
- That's why we hate you.
- We?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.272
You know I love you,
but if I could,

01:04.314 --> 01:05.565
I'd kill you and wear your skin

01:05.607 --> 01:07.859
just so I could
bang supermodels.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.528
I just--I just wanna
be there for a child.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.405
- I wanna have a child.
- Okay, take mine.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.698
And she'll do it
for the checkmark.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.825
I don't want Angela.
I want my own fresh one.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.327
- I wanna dress it all swaggy.
- All right. All right.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.578
Okay, listen to me,
can we please talk about this

01:18.620 --> 01:19.788

being a drug addict?

01:19.829 --> 01:22.749
User, Uncle Tom.
I'm a drug user, okay?

01:22.791 --> 01:23.917
And maybe if I had a kid,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.251
hey, maybe I wouldn't
use drugs so much.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.087
Maybe it'll teach me
to channel my inner chaos

01:27.128 --> 01:28.254
and give my life meaning
or some shit.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.673
- I don't know.
- Bro, what the fuck

01:29.714 --> 01:31.675
are you talking about?
Look at me. I'm a dad.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.594
Do I look like
my life has meaning?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.346
Pete, you're not ready, okay?

01:36.388 --> 01:38.932
You can't just go
and have a family, okay?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.517
That means no more partying,
no more drugs,

01:40.558 --> 01:42.268
no more drinking,
no more friends.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.312
You can't have friends.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.064
Have you ever seen me
with a friend?

01:46.106 --> 01:50.735
No jets to Turks and Belize
or whatever the fuck.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.862
Look, I know you dream
about killing yourself.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.406
That's out the window.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.949
I don't know what else to do,
Uncle Tommy, okay?

01:55.990 --> 01:57.325
I've done everything.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.410
I'm fuckin' running out
of options, all right?

01:58.451 --> 01:59.744
And I talked to my--
[hammer clanging]

01:59.786 --> 02:01.162
I talked to my therapist,
and my therapist thinks

02:01.204 --> 02:02.288
that it's a good idea.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.957
- It may be healthy for me.
- Oh, yeah?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.834
- You know, yeah.
- Well, your therapist needs,

02:05.875 --> 02:08.253
like, a fucking kick
in the balls, okay?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.964
Nobody ever had their life
become better

02:11.006 --> 02:12.048

02:12.090 --> 02:13.800

Yeah, a little.

Ah, fuck.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.267
Here. Take it.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.518
Just be careful with it.
The handle's sharp.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.853
Oh, both are sharp.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.495
Having a baby would solve
all of your problems.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.913
Did you tell him
about how it would,

02:43.955 --> 02:45.623
like, channel your chaos?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.083
It would
give your life meaning?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.335
Yeah,
I told him exactly that.

I don't think he knows

it's an elite egg.

I don't know,
if you're gonna buy the eggs,

03:04.267 --> 03:06.853
you might as well go big.

Oh, my God.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.691

Can you imagine?

03:11.733 --> 03:14.694
She's sing and, you know,
do other things.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.820
Yeah, I don't think
we need to worry

03:15.862 --> 03:16.946
about the egg right now.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.449
I think we gotta find a--
a load holder.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.784
It's called a surrogate, honey.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.577
Yes, and I can take care
of that for you very easy.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.163
- You're the surrogate, yeah.
- [squeals]
