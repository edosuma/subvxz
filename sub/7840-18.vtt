00:34.745 --> 00:36.675
Homer, what took you so long?

00:36.676 --> 00:38.185
The game's almost over.

00:38.186 --> 00:39.933
I got hung up
at the snack stand

00:39.934 --> 00:41.280
watching those hot dogs

00:41.281 --> 00:43.107
rolling and turning,

00:43.108 --> 00:45.333
not a care in the world.

00:45.630 --> 00:48.349
No more lazy Saturdays for you.

00:58.167 --> 00:59.645
Strike two!

01:00.855 --> 01:03.040
By my calculations, we're only

01:03.054 --> 01:04.941
one strike away from victory.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.338
Numbers are fun.

01:06.390 --> 01:07.532
This is it, boys.

01:07.539 --> 01:10.452
One more out and we go
to the championship game.

01:10.495 --> 01:12.191
Let's do it for
Groundskeeper Willie,

01:12.246 --> 01:13.521
who made me this beautiful

01:13.526 --> 01:14.852
black bicep warmer!

01:14.868 --> 01:16.801
It keeps me naughty hands busy.

01:22.175 --> 01:24.433
I got it! I got it!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.222
I hogged it! I hogged it!

01:30.315 --> 01:32.162
My son caught the ball!

01:32.178 --> 01:33.723
This makes up
for everything

01:33.726 --> 01:35.533
that's gone wrong
in my life

01:35.536 --> 01:36.771
or ever will!

01:36.787 --> 01:38.891
I'm also pleased!

01:39.167 --> 01:42.091
After years of failure
in everything we've attempted,

01:42.095 --> 01:45.233
we are one victory away
from a championship, people.

01:45.237 --> 01:47.012
And our newfound glory is all

01:47.018 --> 01:49.371
due to these wonderful boys.

01:52.095 --> 01:54.571
Behold my naked butt!

01:56.688 --> 01:59.443
Each cheek is a god to you!

01:59.446 --> 02:01.220
Now Bart, stay humble.

02:01.225 --> 02:03.761
Your baseball cap won't fit
over a swelled head.

02:03.766 --> 02:05.273
Flanders, these boys

02:05.276 --> 02:06.421
have earned the right

02:06.446 --> 02:08.400
to behave like
arrogant oafs.

02:08.405 --> 02:09.750
Can we egg the crowd?

02:09.757 --> 02:12.241
In this modern-day Deadwood
you can do anything.

02:12.246 --> 02:13.670
All right.

02:17.927 --> 02:19.760
Smithers, I'm missing the fun!

02:19.765 --> 02:20.972
Upsy-daisy, sir.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.161
Ah, what glorious goo!

02:26.167 --> 02:27.293
I need a dress to wear

02:27.298 --> 02:28.860
for my son's big game.

02:28.868 --> 02:30.872
He's the star, I'm his mom,

02:30.876 --> 02:31.921
and he's my son.

02:31.926 --> 02:33.491
Mm-hmm, you've
mentioned his name

02:33.498 --> 02:35.283
and batting average
several times.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.831
Well, he's done very
well for someone

02:36.836 --> 02:38.752
who came out blue
and backwards.

02:39.156 --> 02:41.593
Listen, do you mind
if I hum while you talk?

02:41.597 --> 02:42.653
Not at all!

02:42.656 --> 02:44.771
He single-handedly
got the team

02:44.777 --> 02:46.953
to the championship,
first time ever.

02:46.957 --> 02:49.112
My son caught the ball
that won the game.

02:50.197 --> 02:52.150
I hate shopping !

02:52.195 --> 02:54.133
I'm bored; my feet hurt;

02:54.138 --> 02:56.441
I'm too big for the choo-choo train.

02:56.837 --> 02:57.630
Hmm...

02:57.635 --> 03:00.311
where's the "husband chair" ?

03:02.267 --> 03:04.131
Unless you're serving me a cold beer,

03:04.137 --> 03:05.052
you keep moving.

03:05.067 --> 03:05.952
Oh!

03:06.378 --> 03:07.832
There must be another chair.

03:10.498 --> 03:11.041
Eh-eh.

03:11.045 --> 03:12.972
My wife's lookin' for a bathing suit

03:12.978 --> 03:14.563
that doesn't make her look "horsey."

03:14.568 --> 03:16.641
So, I'm gonna be here a while.

03:17.666 --> 03:18.602
Mm-hmm.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.862
I guess I could just sit on a bed.

03:25.797 --> 03:28.592
Wow, this is soft.

03:29.675 --> 03:32.762
Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.

03:34.227 --> 03:36.931
Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.191
What in the name of...?

03:44.367 --> 03:45.072
Hey, you !

03:45.078 --> 03:46.421
Whoa! How many?

03:46.425 --> 03:49.132
Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?

03:49.418 --> 03:50.093
Well...

03:50.407 --> 03:51.652
who wouldn't

03:51.657 --> 03:53.792
with an incredible mattress like this?

03:53.796 --> 03:56.191
It works with my body's natural curves

03:56.195 --> 03:57.910
and supports my back-boobs.

03:57.927 --> 04:00.353
That's the best endorsement I've heard

04:00.355 --> 04:02.443
since Mickey Mantle for Maypo!

04:02.447 --> 04:04.991
I'll take five mattresses.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.512
I don't work here.

04:06.516 --> 04:08.100
You do now, son!

04:08.107 --> 04:10.890
You're hired!

04:12.598 --> 04:13.512
Woo-hoo!

04:16.315 --> 04:18.712
All this fuss for a baseball game?

04:18.714 --> 04:22.452
Why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?

04:22.457 --> 04:23.771
But it did happen.

04:23.777 --> 04:26.963
Just yesterday,in Crazytown!

04:28.528 --> 04:32.423
So, in the amber gloaming of this September afternoon,

04:32.428 --> 04:35.001
Shelbyville has the bases loaded,

04:35.007 --> 04:37.312
but the Isotots only need one out

04:37.316 --> 04:41.542
to win the championship and get that pizza party at Luigi's !

04:41.545 --> 04:45.533
Luigi's, they deliver on flavor,but not to your house!

04:45.538 --> 04:46.862
Damas y caballeros,

04:46.867 --> 04:50.431
if the Isotots win, please do not fire your guns in the air.

04:50.435 --> 04:51.980
The bullets will come down!

04:51.996 --> 04:53.903
And kill my sister.

04:58.638 --> 05:02.351
A lazy pop fly to star shortstop Bart Simpson.

05:02.365 --> 05:04.221
And this should do it!

05:04.225 --> 05:06.440
Now for the defining moment of my life.

05:18.307 --> 05:19.240
Huh?

05:29.098 --> 05:31.452
Simpson drops the ball!

05:32.168 --> 05:33.353
And he kicks it!

05:33.355 --> 05:35.593
And he kicks it again! And again!

05:35.596 --> 05:37.602
Oh, it's horrible, but you can't

05:37.617 --> 05:38.962
take your eyes away!

05:38.968 --> 05:40.691
It's like watching a monkey

05:40.697 --> 05:42.513
swallow a hand grenade.

05:42.568 --> 05:45.170
The Isotots lose the pennant!

05:45.175 --> 05:48.282
The Isotots lose the pennant!

05:59.355 --> 06:01.293
Bart, you choked!

06:01.297 --> 06:03.592
I put on fresh makeup for this?

06:08.855 --> 06:09.781
Knock it off!

06:09.786 --> 06:11.052
He's just a kid!

06:11.057 --> 06:13.162
Aw, hey that's the guy what created him!

06:13.167 --> 06:14.770
If Homer had used some protection,

06:14.775 --> 06:17.391
we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!

06:17.558 --> 06:19.120
Hey, get off my case!

06:19.125 --> 06:20.511
He's the choke artist!

06:26.017 --> 06:27.642
Quick, Bart,Bart, get in!

06:29.758 --> 06:30.673
Thanks, Chief.

06:30.685 --> 06:31.801
Don't mention it, son.

06:36.266 --> 06:37.413
He's back!

06:37.416 --> 06:39.321
Go nuts, everyone!

06:50.365 --> 06:51.711
Bart's coming down!

06:51.717 --> 06:53.263
Hide the sports section!

06:57.396 --> 06:58.030
D'oh!

07:01.278 --> 07:03.462
Good morning, sweetie.

07:03.467 --> 07:04.683
There's nothing you can say.

07:04.687 --> 07:06.400
After that game,my life is over.

07:06.407 --> 07:08.610
Was there even a baseball game yesterday ?

07:08.618 --> 07:09.782
I don't remember...

07:09.786 --> 07:14.013
Marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago.

07:14.026 --> 07:17.642
Don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman ?

07:17.645 --> 07:18.730
Oh, yeah.

07:18.737 --> 07:20.083
Let's see where that goes.

07:20.225 --> 07:22.101
Let me tell you about a land where it

07:22.105 --> 07:24.840
rains beer and hails pretzels

07:24.844 --> 07:28.082
and you can play swim-up blackjack with Abraham Lincoln.

07:28.101 --> 07:30.500
It's the land of sleep.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.922
And your passport :

07:32.069 --> 07:33.982
a simple mattress.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.691
Yes, I need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging

07:38.698 --> 07:40.720
and my eight horrible babies

07:40.728 --> 07:43.143
and the anguished howls of my ancestors.

07:43.147 --> 07:44.383
A common problem.

07:44.386 --> 07:45.201
Try this.

07:46.936 --> 07:47.932
Oh. Ooh.

07:48.277 --> 07:51.540
Oh, I feel like I'm floating on a river of corpses.

07:51.628 --> 07:54.562
Homer, we have a friend--

07:54.568 --> 07:56.981
actually a friend of a friend...

07:56.988 --> 07:57.992
Sex problem, eh?!

07:57.996 --> 07:58.742
Homer, please.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.952
They can hear you in Fine China.

08:00.955 --> 08:04.693
Relax. I'm a licensed mattress professional,

08:04.695 --> 08:06.682
if there were such a thing,

08:06.688 --> 08:09.523
and I've got the answer to your problems:

08:09.525 --> 08:13.152
The Snugulux by Matrimonium.

08:14.115 --> 08:16.090
Ooh, sold.

08:16.708 --> 08:17.720
And remember:

08:17.728 --> 08:21.102
your most intimate secrets are safe with me.

08:21.106 --> 08:23.151
Okay, who else is dead in bed?

08:23.305 --> 08:25.081
You're listening to KBBL,

08:25.087 --> 08:27.741
your official"Bart Simpson sucks" station.

08:27.746 --> 08:30.311
Oh-ho, and here comes another "Bash Bart Block,"

08:30.318 --> 08:31.150
starting with this

08:31.157 --> 08:33.272
entry from Jimbo,Dolph, and Kearney.

08:33.538 --> 08:35.222
Bart stinks

08:36.265 --> 08:37.643
Yeah, yeah

08:37.645 --> 08:38.893
Bart stinks

08:38.898 --> 08:40.631
Bart stinks

08:41.176 --> 08:42.870
Yeah, yeah

08:42.876 --> 08:44.272
Bart stinks...

08:44.626 --> 08:47.553
Oh, my favorite song ruined !

08:51.675 --> 08:52.870
Bart, come with me.

08:52.885 --> 08:55.313
I'll take you to someone who will make you feel better.

08:55.315 --> 08:57.082
Is it my rabbit Cottontail ?

08:57.088 --> 08:58.761
The one who went to live upstate ?

08:58.766 --> 08:59.822
He died, Bart.

09:00.037 --> 09:02.133
Dad buried him in the backyard.

09:02.326 --> 09:03.872
But not in that order.

09:11.888 --> 09:13.500
Bart, meet Joe LaBoot.

09:13.628 --> 09:15.672
LaBoot, LaBoot.

09:15.785 --> 09:17.332
Sounds familiar.

09:18.105 --> 09:22.101
You probably remember me from 1943 World Series.

09:22.106 --> 09:24.031
With the score tied in game seven,

09:24.038 --> 09:27.431
Tommy Heinrich of the Yankees
hit a ball in my direction.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.363
Jugglin' Joe LaBoot they called me.

09:29.366 --> 09:30.821
When I finally picked up the ball,

09:30.838 --> 09:34.053
I threw it into the stands,hitting Eleanor Roosevelt,

09:34.055 --> 09:36.371
who up till then had been a great beauty.

09:37.258 --> 09:39.910
We lost the game and the series.

09:39.915 --> 09:41.300
But I bounced back.

09:41.308 --> 09:42.771
Got my own car dealership.

09:42.775 --> 09:46.391
I have 17 grandchildren and a big home in Idaho.

09:46.718 --> 09:48.212
It's a great life !

09:48.215 --> 09:49.622
Yeah, in Idaho.

09:49.627 --> 09:52.262
And at these card shows,the fans let me know

09:52.275 --> 09:54.116
that I've put my gaffe behind me.

09:54.116 --> 09:55.851
You stink, LaBoot!

09:56.077 --> 09:58.191
No, I don't!
Google my stats!

09:58.647 --> 10:01.503
Take it from me, kid,
you'll be just fine.

10:01.818 --> 10:02.881
Feel better now, Bart?

10:03.165 --> 10:05.043
"Bart?!"
Are you Bart Simpson?

10:05.795 --> 10:08.130
The kid who dropped
that easy fly ball?!

10:08.355 --> 10:10.530
You stink like a
Dutchman's throw-up.

10:10.695 --> 10:13.031
Talking to you was the
biggest error of my life !

10:15.765 --> 10:17.152
Boo. Boo, indeed.

10:25.165 --> 10:26.193
The Lovejoys ?!

10:26.358 --> 10:29.280
If this is about me drinking that
holy water, let me tell you,

10:29.448 --> 10:31.851
I had had like
a million Doritos.

10:32.016 --> 10:33.643
You know, the ones
with the flame on the bag?

10:33.807 --> 10:35.202
Oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!

10:35.387 --> 10:37.743
- We're here about the mattress.
- What's wrong with it?

10:38.758 --> 10:41.580
We tried raising Cain,
but we weren't able.

10:41.805 --> 10:44.182
Oh, I think I know
what you're doing wrong.

10:44.408 --> 10:45.722
Have you tried...

10:48.567 --> 10:50.853
I know the mechanics
of lovemaking, Homer!

10:51.015 --> 10:52.501
You owe us a refund!

10:52.916 --> 10:54.501
I'll write you a check.

10:55.798 --> 11:00.101
"Pay to the order
of Stupid Reverend.

11:00.388 --> 11:03.021
Memo: Bite my ass."

11:04.808 --> 11:05.673
Wha...?!

11:07.816 --> 11:10.193
Homer, I'm not a man
who believes in miracles,

11:10.825 --> 11:14.131
but this bed of yours
could resurrect our sex life.

11:14.555 --> 11:17.353
If you let us have your mattress,
we'll give you ours.

11:17.525 --> 11:20.451
On one condition:
you do the shlepping.

11:20.777 --> 11:22.793
Well, I'll have
to check with my wife.

11:40.068 --> 11:41.153
Move over just a...

11:41.157 --> 11:44.472
- Ow, well, maybe if you g..
- No, wrong,wrong, wrong !

11:44.776 --> 11:46.420
I'm sorry, Homie.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.532
I want to snuggle, but
I'm just not feeling it.

11:49.746 --> 11:53.843
Yeah, something has changed,
but I can't figure out what.

11:55.035 --> 11:56.100
Our mattress!

11:56.428 --> 11:58.302
I traded it to the Lovejoys!

11:58.547 --> 11:59.933
You traded our mattress?

12:00.127 --> 12:02.063
I had my secret cash in it.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.751
Oh, that's long gone, baby.

12:04.018 --> 12:05.140
Long gone.

12:06.728 --> 12:09.083
It was made for Elvis,
but he found it tacky.

12:10.236 --> 12:14.133
But I can't believe a mattress
could make that much difference.

12:14.685 --> 12:16.531
This little light of mine

12:16.706 --> 12:18.963
I'm gonna let it shine Oh, glory

12:19.117 --> 12:22.510
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

12:22.676 --> 12:25.230
Every day, every day

12:25.435 --> 12:29.601
Every day
Yay, yay, yay !

12:31.475 --> 12:37.132
Lousy Reverend, he's having my sex
while I'm at home with Marge

12:37.296 --> 12:40.700
not doing anything
sensual or erotic.

13:01.228 --> 13:04.501
A damp sponge will take care
of this weak, water-based...

13:05.107 --> 13:06.113
It's oil-based !

13:06.328 --> 13:08.121
- Oil-based !
- Daddy ?

13:08.495 --> 13:10.241
Fetch Daddy's thinner, boy.

13:10.546 --> 13:12.061
But it's in the "stay away" closet.

13:12.157 --> 13:13.163
You just fetch it!

13:24.257 --> 13:26.161
Who would do this to Bart?

13:26.405 --> 13:29.380
The person who hates Bart
more than anyone else.

13:29.557 --> 13:30.550
Look!

13:32.487 --> 13:34.912
Oh, yeah, that's really something.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.812
Mom, put your glasses on.

13:36.915 --> 13:38.471
But they make me look dowdy.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.023
My baby!

13:49.006 --> 13:50.742
See? I hate me, too.

13:51.427 --> 13:52.563
Now we can be friends again.

13:53.838 --> 13:54.842
Bart, stop!

13:55.018 --> 13:57.283
No one's mad at you anymore, right?

13:57.728 --> 13:59.323
Yeah. Yeah.
You know.

13:59.378 --> 14:00.212
Jump!

14:00.886 --> 14:01.940
Who-Who said that?

14:02.308 --> 14:03.203
I hate Bart Simpson!

14:05.236 --> 14:06.551
I got him!
I got him!

14:08.078 --> 14:09.810
You stink, LaBoot!

14:10.048 --> 14:10.853
Damn it!

14:13.935 --> 14:14.942
He'll be all right.

14:15.297 --> 14:18.082
Right now he just needs
peace and quiet.

14:18.627 --> 14:20.880
Bart sucks!
Bart sucks!

14:21.055 --> 14:23.172
Bart sucks!
Bart sucks!

14:23.557 --> 14:25.641
You should all be ashamed!

14:25.806 --> 14:29.142
Passing judgment on a child
for a sports boo-boo!

14:29.366 --> 14:30.973
What have you people ever done?

14:31.225 --> 14:33.501
Well, I wrote a best-selling
series of mystery novels.

14:35.126 --> 14:36.871
Stephen King called it,
"Scary, good fun."

14:37.058 --> 14:38.473
Besides that.

14:40.066 --> 14:41.192
Now, thanks to you,

14:41.287 --> 14:46.263
my special little guy will be haunted
by this for the rest of his life.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.230
I always thought
that was just a slogan

14:48.408 --> 14:49.981
to attract small businesses.

14:52.116 --> 14:54.080
But now I know it's the truth.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.443
Okay, Midge.

14:57.516 --> 15:00.022
You made us feel bad
about what we done to your boy,

15:00.126 --> 15:01.323
but what can we do about it now?

15:01.405 --> 15:03.303
It's not like we can play
the game over again.

15:04.807 --> 15:05.813
Can't we?

15:05.987 --> 15:07.193
Like I just said, we can't.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.852
- Are you sure?
- Open your freakin' ears.

15:10.015 --> 15:12.800
- No!
- I think maybe we... Could.

15:13.096 --> 15:16.392
And I say,
I have difficulty Envisioning it.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.600
Let me get this straight.

15:18.717 --> 15:22.343
You want our boys to play a fake
rematch against Springfield

15:22.535 --> 15:24.332
so your son can make
the catch he missed

15:24.515 --> 15:25.992
and feel better about himself.

15:26.157 --> 15:28.110
- Exactly.
- I guess I could, uh,

15:28.407 --> 15:30.920
if you pretend to be my fiancie
when my mother comes to visit.

15:31.055 --> 15:31.853
Okay.

15:32.015 --> 15:35.342
If you pretend to be our chauffeur
at my highschool reunion.

15:35.438 --> 15:36.370
Fine, fine,

15:36.488 --> 15:39.470
if you pretend to be a ghost at an old
amusement park I'm trying to buy.

15:39.557 --> 15:40.821
- We should stop now.
- Yeah.

15:41.405 --> 15:44.623
You want me to reannounce
a game I've already called?

15:44.737 --> 15:46.960
Oh, sister, I got
too much integrity.

15:47.117 --> 15:51.173
The same integrity Farmer Dan
puts into every link sausage.

15:51.377 --> 15:53.393
Then I guess
you wouldn't mind eating one.

15:55.466 --> 15:56.393
Of course I wouldn't.

15:56.577 --> 16:00.783
It's not like they're made
of skunk tails and horse nipples.

16:00.908 --> 16:02.051
I'll do whatever you say!

16:02.056 --> 16:04.202
Just get that death wiener
away from me!

16:10.498 --> 16:12.831
I'm starting to feel funny
about doing this.

16:13.035 --> 16:14.691
Look, we're just going
to take our mattress,

16:14.816 --> 16:17.443
do a quick sweep of the medicine chest,
then we're out of here.

16:22.077 --> 16:22.990
Homer, stop that.

16:24.296 --> 16:25.180
Sorry.

16:26.437 --> 16:29.421
There it is.
Old Bounce an' Giggle.

16:38.618 --> 16:41.903
You put on the Michael Bolton CD.
I'll put on my edible vestments.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.793
Oh, my God!

16:46.145 --> 16:48.772
How dare you breakin to our house,
defile our bed,

16:48.868 --> 16:50.850
and smash our family photos
with your foot.

16:51.007 --> 16:52.433
Well, excuse me

16:52.757 --> 16:55.173
for being a powerful
yet careless lover.

16:55.295 --> 16:58.770
Reverend Lovejoy, our
marriage needs this bed.

16:59.015 --> 17:00.342
Our marriage needs it more!

17:00.996 --> 17:06.422
Well, I am reminded of the story
of wise King Solomon.

17:06.935 --> 17:07.943
You would be.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.701
I wish he hadn't cut it that way.

17:14.885 --> 17:16.770
It looks like a
grilled-cheese sandwich.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.462
Or a chicken club.

17:18.984 --> 17:20.691
Or a-a Reuben.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.502
Or a Monte Cristo, or...

17:24.046 --> 17:25.390
Pull over behind that billboard!

17:30.347 --> 17:31.300
Oh! Oh, yeah!

17:31.988 --> 17:35.683
You really want to make love on
half a mattress behind a billboard?

17:35.906 --> 17:38.871
It's like our honeymoon
all over again.

17:40.077 --> 17:42.980
We even have the same bum
looking at us.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.860
I knew you kids would make it.

17:46.248 --> 17:47.542
Man, you got fat.

17:48.177 --> 17:51.430
So, it's déja vu all over again

17:51.635 --> 17:56.822
as Springfield needs just one out
to win the game and the championship.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.163
Who'd have thunk it?

17:58.408 --> 18:00.462
Probably everyone
who was here the last time.

18:00.718 --> 18:01.943
I still can't believe it.

18:02.127 --> 18:04.642
They dusted the plate
with a non-regulation brush,

18:04.726 --> 18:06.812
so we have to play
the last inning over again.

18:07.346 --> 18:10.030
I think this time
it'll have a happier ending.

18:10.307 --> 18:11.401
Why do you think that?

18:11.528 --> 18:12.801
Uh... uh...

18:13.935 --> 18:16.063
They warned
me not to talk to you.

18:16.297 --> 18:18.063
- Who warned you?
- Nobody!

18:26.977 --> 18:28.473
Hello, redemption.

18:32.837 --> 18:34.602
Bart gets another try!

18:34.918 --> 18:38.230
Uh, the batter hit it
by accident, not by design.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.370
Play ball!

18:46.157 --> 18:50.280
Er, uh, that is also a
do-over cause, um, er, uh...

18:50.476 --> 18:52.171
There's a naked idiot on the field.

19:23.216 --> 19:24.070
Woo-hoo!

19:24.366 --> 19:25.183
D'oh!

19:31.456 --> 19:32.883
Play ball.

19:41.228 --> 19:43.283
I did it! I did it!
I did it!

19:43.775 --> 19:45.592
Oh. Yay.
All right.

19:46.176 --> 19:49.870
And the 78th time
is the charm!

19:50.117 --> 19:51.813
Now, over the left field wall,

19:51.895 --> 19:55.873
the real show's about to begin:
the glorious sunrise,

19:56.078 --> 19:57.790
brought to you by God,

19:57.987 --> 20:01.302
the invisible giant you turn to
when you're about to die.

20:03.415 --> 20:04.420
Hey, Milhouse,

20:04.535 --> 20:08.811
did I ever tell you about
the catch I made when I was ten?

20:09.048 --> 20:11.623
Greatest moment of my life.

20:11.847 --> 20:14.233
It was a fake, you idiot!

20:14.405 --> 20:16.672
We did it to make you feel better.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.920
A fake?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.201
Then I did suck.

20:20.507 --> 20:22.350
I-I... I do suck!

20:25.607 --> 20:28.893
No, that was a fake just now.

20:29.207 --> 20:31.120
You did make the catch.

20:31.295 --> 20:34.202
I knew it!
I rule!

20:34.537 --> 20:36.020
And you drool!

20:38.605 --> 20:41.511
Boy, our son can be a real jerk.

20:41.886 --> 20:43.391
Hey, do you want
to have ghost sex?

20:43.506 --> 20:46.262
I keep telling you,ghost sex is nothing.

20:46.365 --> 20:47.443
It's worse than nothing.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.581
Then why were you
moaning last time?

20:49.735 --> 20:51.080
Because I'm a ghost!

20:52.885 --> 20:53.950
A ghost!

20:54.427 --> 20:56.110
