DESERT HEARTS

01:52.735 --> 01:54.479
Excuse me.

01:54.702 --> 01:58.397
Passengers of the super speed
service to Sacramento and Oakland.

01:59.896 --> 02:01.693
can now be on board.

02:06.295 --> 02:08.092
-Can I help you, miss?
-Please.

02:08.999 --> 02:11.796
-I'll bring this for you.
-Thank you.

02:18.992 --> 02:20.788
-Professor Bell!

02:22.696 --> 02:24.492
- You can call me Vivian.
- Welcome to Reno.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.196
-I am down the street.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.900
- Hi Francie.
- Hello, Burnett.

02:30.909 --> 02:32.706
- I have space in my car.
- No, not such luck.

02:36.308 --> 02:39.003
Well, you are looking forward
to some desert living?

02:39.012 --> 02:41.809
I'am looking forward to get
these shoes of.

02:42.716 --> 02:44.513
It's terrible when
your legs hurts.

02:45.420 --> 02:47.217
It's a kindest thing
I've heard in three days.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.819
- How long have you been married?
- 12 years.

02:52.727 --> 02:54.523
No,no. We handle that.

02:55.456 --> 02:57.355
Quint, that's a lucky one. 

02:58.363 --> 03:00.262
I could have used that last night.

03:10.271 --> 03:12.169
See you in six weeks, madam.

03:12.178 --> 03:14.076
Soon as we are out of here you
can tell me all about youself.

03:18.085 --> 03:24.984
I was the special dancer
in casino over there, 100 years ago.

03:27.992 --> 03:29.891
Do you have children??

03:30.900 --> 03:32.798
We were a couple of
professionals.

03:35.807 --> 03:39.705
My husband was a prominent lawyer,
here in town.

03:42.714 --> 03:44.613
- He died of a heart attack at 41.
- Sorry.

03:47.622 --> 03:49.520
How long have you been alone?

03:49.529 --> 03:52.427
I'm not alone, I have my boy.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.334
My girlworks there
in the Golden Ring.

03:59.343 --> 04:02.242
Has the unbridled
Glen force!

04:06.251 --> 04:08.149
I have always lived
in the city.

04:09.158 --> 04:11.056
Do not know what to do
with all this space.

04:12.065 --> 04:14.963
I think of it as a God's backyard.

04:15.972 --> 04:18.870
Just sit back and let
it clean out the impurities.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.778
-And the heat?
-Lot of ice tea and not deep thinking.

04:24.787 --> 04:26.685
I agree

04:28.694 --> 04:30.593
Oh, Jesus!

04:40.601 --> 04:42.500
-What are you doing at this hour?
- I have things to do.

04:44.509 --> 04:47.407
-Professor Bell, Cay Rivers.
-How do you do.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.314
-Shall I call you the professor?
-No, Vivian Bell.

04:56.323 --> 04:58.222
Put that damned car forward!

05:02.231 --> 05:04.129
Jesus!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.036
You'll never guess who that was.

05:08.045 --> 05:10.943
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Of course not.

05:11.952 --> 05:13.851
Never would have guessed
you smoked.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.758
May I be honest, Frances?

05:18.767 --> 05:20.665
That is an endangered art.
Forward.

05:23.674 --> 05:26.572
My things are a little bit shaky 
for me at the moment.

05:29.581 --> 05:32.480
-Thank you for open up ...
-I can not be a part of group right now.

05:37.489 --> 05:38.387
Leave it to me.

05:39.396 --> 05:41.294
Thank you.

06:24.303 --> 06:27.202
Walter, we are here!

06:32.210 --> 06:35.109
Walter, shake hands
with professor Vivian.

06:36.118 --> 06:38.016
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:38.025 --> 06:41.923
-You are younger than I thought.
-I'll take that as a compliment.

06:42.932 --> 06:44.831
Bring bags, Walter.

06:48.839 --> 06:50.738
You gona love it here.

06:59.747 --> 07:01.645
Well, here it is.

07:02.654 --> 07:04.552
Nice, isn't it?.

07:06.561 --> 07:08.460
Lovely.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.367
-He will take you to your room.
-Thank you.

07:25.376 --> 07:27.274
-The bathroom is over there.
-Thank you.

07:28.283 --> 07:30.181
What do you teach?

07:30.190 --> 07:32.089
Literature at the University
Columbia.

07:33.098 --> 07:35.996
116th Street, Broadway,
New York, New York.

07:42.005 --> 07:44.903
I know you want me to hang around and 
tell you history of the ranch.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.810
How did you guess, Walter?

08:49.819 --> 08:51.718
Why I did not stay in a hotel?

09:13.727 --> 09:17.625
I felt burned and start to yearn

09:17.634 --> 09:19.532
Hold you tight

09:24.541 --> 09:26.440
- Guess what baby girl.
- What?

09:27.448 --> 09:29.347
I am engaged.

09:29.356 --> 09:31.254
-Hello
-Hello, love.

09:31.263 --> 09:33.161
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Careful not to stay blind.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.069
and...

09:38.077 --> 09:40.976
I'm pregnant.

09:41.985 --> 09:44.883
Joe and I are settling down.
Darrel and you should follow.

09:45.892 --> 09:48.790
-We would go on vacation together.
-I feel nothing for Darrel.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.698
I never get tired 
to defend your reputations.

09:52.707 --> 09:54.605
I got used people 
talking behind my back.

09:56.614 --> 09:58.512
but if you did not accept
who I am 

10:00.521 --> 10:02.419
that would really be tought.

10:04.428 --> 10:06.327
Hey, you're the best.

10:06.336 --> 10:09.234
And all the best people 
know it.

10:46.243 --> 10:48.141
Thank you

10:52.150 --> 10:54.048
Good luck. Thank you.

10:55.057 --> 10:57.956
- Would you like to play that, sir?
- Sherman.

10:58.965 --> 11:00.863
Sherman, would you like to play?

11:00.872 --> 11:02.770
I prefer to play with you,
my love.

11:05.779 --> 11:07.678
Apologize to the lady, buddy.

11:09.686 --> 11:11.585
-Apologize, man.
-Sorry.

11:14.594 --> 11:16.492
It makes two of us.

11:16.401 --> 11:18.399
-Thank you.
-You are right?

11:18.408 --> 11:19.307
Yes.

11:39.315 --> 11:42.214
- A cup of tea?
- Frances!

11:44.223 --> 11:46.121
-Do you have any burbon?
-Sure.

11:48.130 --> 11:50.028
In fact, I'll joing you.

11:51.037 --> 11:53.936
Will not do any harm.

11:54.945 --> 11:56.843
It's the weather.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.750
I was reading a lot.

12:01.759 --> 12:03.657
You sound like Cay.

12:04.666 --> 12:07.565
She locks herself in that college
and works until she drops.

12:08.574 --> 12:10.472
-What does she work?
-She is a sculptor.

12:17.481 --> 12:19.379
Oh, don't look at that stuff

12:20.388 --> 12:24.287
It is sentimental junk.
I have no taste.

12:27.295 --> 12:29.194
That is Glen, Cay's father.

12:31.203 --> 12:33.101
I had Walter with him.

12:35.110 --> 12:37.008
I'm not the mother of Cay.

12:38.017 --> 12:39.916
I'm her ...

12:39.924 --> 12:41.823
I do not know what I am.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.730
Not anything really.

12:47.739 --> 12:49.637
Only one pair of hands 
and a familiar face.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.545
Thank you

12:56.554 --> 12:58.452
God, look at him.

12:59.461 --> 13:01.359
As handsome as day is long.

13:01.368 --> 13:03.266
And married.

13:05.275 --> 13:08.174
I lived with him 10 years.

13:11.183 --> 13:15.081
Maybe I didn't get my wedding
bouquet in my collection.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.000
But I got what I wanted.

13:18.997 --> 13:20.895
I had a love of my own.

13:22.904 --> 13:24.803
That song is beautiful.

13:26.812 --> 13:28.710
You had more than 
most people dare hope for.

13:33.719 --> 13:35.617
Do not pay attention.

13:35.626 --> 13:37.525
I'm just babbling.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.432
I am a silly woman.

13:47.441 --> 13:49.339
I don't think you are, Frances.

14:13.348 --> 14:14.246
Hi.

14:18.255 --> 14:20.154
You and me should make
a raisins pie.

14:21.162 --> 14:24.061
-I'm too depressed.
-In this air?.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.968
Will you well be fine when you 
leave that creep.

14:27.007 --> 14:29.000
Larry is not a creep 

14:29.884 --> 14:31.783
Any man who leaves a woman 
for a model is a creep in my book.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.690
I do not know which is worse.

14:35.699 --> 14:37.597
A cheeter or a hobby man.

14:39.606 --> 14:41.504
At least you can share 
a hobby, Lucille.

14:42.513 --> 14:44.412
We would all like to
have a different past.

14:46.421 --> 14:48.319
Good morning!

14:48.328 --> 14:50.226
Good morning.

14:52.235 --> 14:54.133
-I come down to stretch my legs.
-It's was about time.

14:55.142 --> 14:57.041
What did you do in that room 
for last five days?

14:58.050 --> 15:00.948
Whatever it is, it is too deep 
for us to understand.

15:03.957 --> 15:05.855
Come, sit down.
Join the girl talk.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.763
We talked about sex 
vs. marriage.

15:09.771 --> 15:12.670
I'm not an expert on these issues 
so I apologize.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.577
I heard that your culture types
go out like a bench sheet.

15:15.586 --> 15:18.484
- Lucille!
- Is that true?

15:20.493 --> 15:23.392
A bench sheet is a woman 
weeping for the dead.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.299
Perhaps you wanted 
to say "monkeys".

15:27.308 --> 15:28.206
Hey!

15:30.215 --> 15:33.113
Well, I'll start with my pie. 

15:35.122 --> 15:37.021
Lucille, would you drop Cays' mail?

15:38.030 --> 15:40.928
I'll take it.

15:40.937 --> 15:42.835
Just going for a walk, anyway.

15:43.844 --> 15:45.742
Just slip it under her door.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.650
You do not have to knock!

16:03.659 --> 16:05.557
- Morning!
- Morning!

16:25.566 --> 16:27.464
I was just passing by.

16:30.473 --> 16:32.371
Thanks.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.279
Do you want to come in?

16:40.659 --> 16:43.557
-I'd love to but you're busy.
-Come in anyway.

16:49.566 --> 16:51.464
To see if I can see it all
in one glance.

16:52.566 --> 16:54.464
Look around.

17:07.473 --> 17:09.371
I can't do it if you are watching me.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.279
- Hello!
- Hey....!

17:18.288 --> 17:19.185
Hello

17:19.194 --> 17:22.093
-Where is Cay?
-I am here. Go back to sleep.

17:25.102 --> 17:27.001
Sorry. I was not alone.

17:26.102 --> 17:29.001
Fine. Socialization
was not what I had in mind, anyway.

17:40.009 --> 17:42.908
You get all that traffic  
without any equipment?

17:44.009 --> 17:46.908
I can not understand.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.815
-Where are you going?
-To an appointment with the lawyer. 

18:16.824 --> 18:18.722
No sense in taking two cars?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.630
-I do not want to intrude.
-Will you bring her back?

18:20.646 --> 18:23.545
Oh, don't worry about that.
Give space, Gwen.

18:23.554 --> 18:27.452
You have a car for today
and I save the trip.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.359
Cay, drive like a lady.

18:35.368 --> 18:37.266
Someone used it as an ashtray.
Come in front. 

18:44.275 --> 18:46.174
Long time without seeing you, Mrs. Parker.

18:48.183 --> 18:50.081
Doesn't bother me.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.988
-This is my friend, Gwen.
-We met.

18:58.997 --> 19:00.895
Yes, nice to see you again.

19:18.904 --> 19:20.803
-Are you serious?
-Why?

19:20.812 --> 19:23.710
That music is for a funeral.

19:25.719 --> 19:27.617
Do you know that piece, Vivian?

19:27.626 --> 19:30.525
Yes, it is a piece of Prokofiev. 
Lovely, isn't it?

19:31.533 --> 19:33.432
I better get to the record
store before they sell it out.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.339
Oh, come on, Gwen.
We all have sensitive side.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.246
I do not remember that
you said that last night.

19:57.255 --> 20:00.154
-Thank you.
-Do you want me to wait?

20:00.162 --> 20:02.061
I am sure you have better things 
to do than wait for me.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.968
Oh look, I am sorry about Gwen.

20:03.977 --> 20:06.875
You know why I am here for. 
I don't need to understand your friends?

20:07.884 --> 20:09.783
I'll leave the key here.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.690
I have more important things to
think than how I'll go back.

20:12.699 --> 20:14.597
Thanks anyway!

20:14.606 --> 20:16.504
You're welcome.

20:21.513 --> 20:25.412
From what I see in this agreement,
Dr. Bell walks out with everything.

20:25.421 --> 20:27.219
I've always supported myself.

20:27.328 --> 20:29.226
All I want are my books.

20:31.235 --> 20:33.133
-Is there a third party?
-No.

20:34.142 --> 20:36.041
Rare women, walks out with  
no strings.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.948
What is your ground?

20:41.957 --> 20:43.855
It is not that I have practiced 
this.

20:46.864 --> 20:48.763
It is not easy to talk 
with an attorney.

20:51.771 --> 20:53.670
-Do you like ranch?
-It's different.

20:56.679 --> 20:57.577
There are many crazy people there.

20:57.586 --> 21:01.484
Mr. Warner, I have 35 years.
I want an honest life.

21:01.493 --> 21:03.392
I am leaving a decent marriage 
to see if I can find one.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.299
Not having children helps.

21:05.308 --> 21:08.206
Although our careers served very 
much that purpose all these years.

21:08.215 --> 21:10.113
To bond us togehter.
We were very big on form.

21:12.122 --> 21:17.021
Right friends, a prince
on the wall.

21:20.030 --> 21:23.928
I urge for something we can not 
analyze or rationalize.

21:27.937 --> 21:30.535
I want to break free 
from what I've been.

21:30.844 --> 21:32.742
And your husband?

21:34.751 --> 21:36.650
Martin wants to have me 
no matter how I feel.

21:36.659 --> 21:38.557
-He will not contest?
-No, no.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.464
Well...

21:42.473 --> 21:46.371
-We'll go with mental cruelty.
-We've never treated each other that way.

21:47.380 --> 21:49.279
It's just a formal term.

21:50.288 --> 21:53.186
It is better for law.
A headacke or two.

21:27.195 --> 21:57.093
Sure he refused to
visit in-laws, sometimes.

21:58.102 --> 22:00.001
Maybe I'll be alone 
the rest of my life.

22:01.009 --> 22:04.908
I made a very difficult decision and 
it was not based on a headache or two.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.815
Time for a martini.
Would you like to take one with me?

22:14.824 --> 22:16.722
Please, go on.

22:18.731 --> 22:21.630
Well, the first thing I 
advise my clients 

22:23.638 --> 22:25.537
is not to leave the state 
once the residence is established.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.444
Many leave to San Francisco 
for a break.

22:30.453 --> 22:32.351
Don't misunderstand me,
Mr. Warner.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.259
But that does not happen 
in this case.

22:35.268 --> 22:38.166
No. I trust we can leave the
keys with you any time.

22:42.175 --> 22:43.073
Thank you.

22:47.082 --> 22:49.980
Ok, put your stuff in here.

22:50.989 --> 22:53.888
Lock it up. The changing room
is over there.

22:53.897 --> 22:56.795
-Hello everybody. -This is Joyce.
-Hello, Joyce!

22:57.804 --> 23:00.702
I leave you with the girls.
See you on the floor.

23:00.711 --> 23:01.610
All right.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.517
Cay, I'll like to see you in my office?
Please.

23:11.526 --> 23:13.424
Darrel, where shall I put the key?

23:13.433 --> 23:15.331
-Oh, God!
-I'll tell you where.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.239
Thank you, Silver.

23:18.247 --> 23:20.146
That was not very clever.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.053
Cay.

23:36.662 --> 23:38.960
Do you know how much I love you?

23:44.969 --> 23:47.868
I started to express myself
and ruined everything?

23:49.804 --> 23:51.702
There's nothing to ruin, Darrel

23:53.659 --> 23:55.557
And I've been honest with you
about why.

23:56.566 --> 23:57.464
I know everything.

23:59.473 --> 24:01.371
I can look the other way 
if I had to.

24:11.380 --> 24:13.279
Oh, hi.

24:25.288 --> 24:28.186
-Sorry.
-Frances is awake.

24:28.195 --> 24:30.093
I just thought about ...

24:30.094 --> 24:31.094
having a cup of tea.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.001
Let me get it for you.

24:33.009 --> 24:35.908
Don't bother. I could
use a practice.

24:40.917 --> 24:42.815
Would you, please, go and
sit down?

24:42.824 --> 24:44.722
If she hear us, I wont
get out in less than hour.

24:46.731 --> 24:49.630
I'll come back when it is less 
complicated. 

24:53.638 --> 24:54.537
Shit!

24:56.546 --> 24:58.444
What are you doing?

24:59.453 --> 25:01.351
Shut up!

25:04.360 --> 25:05.259
I'll clean.

25:08.268 --> 25:10.166
Look at my boots.

25:21.175 --> 25:23.073
Please, don't
turn on the light.

25:27.082 --> 25:29.980
What's matter?
You are having a rough night?

25:31.989 --> 25:33.888
You could say that.

25:34.897 --> 25:37.795
Listen, I'm always awake.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.702
Next time you can't sleep,
come to my cottage.

25:41.711 --> 25:43.610
Some company will help.

25:43.618 --> 25:45.517
You'll make me cry.

25:48.526 --> 25:50.424
No.
I'm going to make you some tea.

25:54.433 --> 25:56.331
Is it you, Cay?
- Yeah

25:59.340 --> 26:03.239
Bring me a coke, please?
I have a glass.

26:18.247 --> 26:21.146
-Who is in the kitchen?
-Vivian is making tea.

26:22.155 --> 26:24.053
She is so nice.

26:24.062 --> 26:26.960
This all place has risen 
category since she came.

26:30.969 --> 26:33.868
I spend all night 
struggling with migrene.

26:35.877 --> 26:37.775
You are wearing that one
out, Frances.

26:40.784 --> 26:42.682
No, everything is falling apart.

26:42.691 --> 26:45.589
It is middle of the night.
It will be together by morning.

26:50.598 --> 26:51.497
Ok...

26:53.506 --> 26:55.504
What is falling apart?

26:55.413 --> 26:57.311
The ranch, for example.

26:57.320 --> 27:01.218
Business is bad. I don't think 
it will hold much longer.

27:04.227 --> 27:06.126
Remember the good old days?

27:07.989 --> 27:09.888
Can not drink for the good old days.

27:11.897 --> 27:15.795
If I do sell, I want you 
to come with me.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.702
We do not picture us living
in two rooms togehter.

27:19.711 --> 27:21.610
Oh, It will be bigger than that.

27:23.618 --> 27:25.517
If you come with me 

27:26.526 --> 27:29.424
You can leave the casino 
and go to study art.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.331
Botton yourself up.

27:35.340 --> 27:38.239
Professor does not need
to see your business popping out.

27:38.247 --> 27:41.146
-Where are your pants?
-I have to go.

27:41.155 --> 27:44.053
I will not stay so do not 
squeeze me.

27:46.062 --> 27:49.960
You and Walter are all 
I have left from Glen!

27:49.969 --> 27:51.868
Glen is dead.

27:55.877 --> 27:57.775
No, if I still have you.

27:59.784 --> 28:02.682
Someday I will meet someone
who counts.

28:04.691 --> 28:08.589
Counts?
But look at who your friends are.

28:08.598 --> 28:11.497
Do not ask your support. But
if you stand in my way ...

28:22.506 --> 28:24.404
Now, go to sleep.

28:31.413 --> 28:33.311
I empty out my ice box.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.218
Good night, Frances.

29:12.227 --> 29:13.126
Good morning!

29:16.135 --> 29:17.033
Good morning.

29:17.042 --> 29:19.940
When was the last time you
ride a horse?

29:20.949 --> 29:22.848
I don't even remember.

29:22.856 --> 29:24.755
Then, take off your reading
glasses and come over here.

29:45.764 --> 29:47.662
I did not know you were 
painting, Frances?

29:48.671 --> 29:50.569
The last supper.

29:53.578 --> 29:56.477
Oh, looks like someone did not pack
riding cloths.

29:56.485 --> 29:58.384
I thought my riding days are
behind me.

29:58.393 --> 30:00.291
Here. Try this to see the size. 
- Oh.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.198
Reserve me place in the mental
for me.

30:07.207 --> 30:09.106
Good times are hard in the end. 

30:14.115 --> 30:16.013
Sorry about your friend 
the other day.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.920
I temporary lost my sense 
of humor.

30:19.929 --> 30:21.827
It is awful to forget
how to laugh.

30:22.836 --> 30:26.735
I'm always get-by by laughing. 
That what you are going through
takes real courage.

30:26.744 --> 30:28.642
You're the first person to say so.
Everyone else ...

30:30.651 --> 30:33.549
Well, maybe, I am up 
to the risk.

30:34.558 --> 30:37.456
Here you go. Maybe some of your  
gambling spirit rob off on me.

30:38.465 --> 30:41.364
I am sure that nobody accuses 
you of playing safe.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.271
No, but that is because they 
don't really know me.

30:44.280 --> 30:47.178
There are so many things 
I want to do but I am affraid to try.

30:48.187 --> 30:51.086
-You're ambitious?
- I do all right here.

30:52.094 --> 30:55.993
But there's always another story 
under the surface.

30:56.002 --> 30:59.900
- You know what I mean?
- I am about to. My surface drowned.

31:00.909 --> 31:05.807
-Did you realise all your ambitions?
-No. Only my plans.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.715
What do you say when they ask 
about your marriage?

31:10.723 --> 31:14.622
-I tell you that it sank in still waters.
-Say no more.

32:09.631 --> 32:12.529
Hot ass, Joe.
Congratulations.

32:12.538 --> 32:15.436
What? With a ring costing $ 100.
I need condolences.

32:16.445 --> 32:19.344
-But her eyes are sparkling.
-Not sparkling. It is panic.

32:23.353 --> 32:26.251
Kiss me in a way to
last me the entire shift.

32:34.723 --> 32:35.622
Pervert.

32:36.465 --> 32:39.364
-Do you have a date, Cay?
-No.

32:39.373 --> 32:42.271
Pick up an extra steak, lover?

32:43.280 --> 32:44.178
Hey!

32:47.187 --> 32:52.086
I can not keep my hands off him.

32:52.094 --> 32:54.993
And you invite me to your house 
to watch the show?

32:55.002 --> 32:58.900
I want to find out  
why are you so mysterious.

33:03.909 --> 33:07.807
Joe is in the kitchen,
you in the bathtub. I am happy.

33:09.816 --> 33:11.715
Ok, now start talking.

33:13.723 --> 33:16.622
-You'll gonna laugh.
-It must be serious.

33:18.631 --> 33:21.529
I think I've found somebody 
who counts.

33:21.538 --> 33:24.436
From the beginning 
and do not miss the good parts.

33:25.445 --> 33:32.344
Well, she is professor of English 
and is 10 years older than me.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Well, rock'n'roll!

33:37.260 --> 33:39.158
It sounds a lot funnier than it is.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.065
She is at the ranch?

33:42.074 --> 33:45.000
You promised not to mess around.

33:47.982 --> 33:49.880
Vivian Bell.

33:50.889 --> 33:52.787
I just say her name 
when I want to smile.

33:53.796 --> 33:55.694
Did you sleep with her?

33:55.703 --> 33:57.602
No. And probably will not.

33:58.611 --> 34:01.509
-She does not want?
-It's not that, Sil.

34:06.518 --> 34:11.416
Just remember that she will pick
up her decree and leave.

34:13.425 --> 34:17.324
Maybe by then I will figure out 
something in this screwed life of mine.

34:20.331 --> 34:22.231
Oh, I love your life, babe.

34:24.239 --> 34:26.138
I don't want to be here without you.

34:31.147 --> 34:33.045
You look like two desserts.

34:33.454 --> 34:35.953
Thank you for that.

34:37.962 --> 34:41.860
Sometimes I'd like to know what 
is like to be a beautiful woman.

34:41.869 --> 34:44.766
-You want the ring back, honey?
-No.

34:44.775 --> 34:46.674
Maybe I'll be reincarnated.

34:50.683 --> 34:52.000
I'm going to check steaks.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.489
Joe.

34:57.498 --> 35:01.396
I'm afraid that if it will stay...
... this good...

35:01.405 --> 35:03.303
I'll find a way to fuck it up.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.211
Babe, don't we always 
stick with good times?

35:19.220 --> 35:22.118
-Did Cay behave herself the other day?
-She was absolutely charming.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.025
-I would not be too won over by her.
-I do not understand.

35:32.034 --> 35:36.933
The thing is ...
She has nothing in common with...

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
a person of your caliber.

35:48.010 --> 35:51.747
I've seen this movie.
Good night.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.654
We could stay here all day.
I'll bring lunch.

36:00.663 --> 36:01.562
See you.

36:02.570 --> 36:03.469
Bye.

36:06.478 --> 36:08.376
Will you give me one?

36:09.385 --> 36:10.283
No,no!

36:13.292 --> 36:15.191
It's too big.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.098
Take it on.

36:24.107 --> 36:28.005
He did nothing as a singer.
So I started to work in casino.

36:29.014 --> 36:31.912
In a hope of being discovered.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.820
-Who named you "Silver"?
-I did.

36:36.009 --> 36:38.727
But she still answers to Silvia
when she is wiery.

36:38.736 --> 36:42.634
I'll ignore that...
Catherine Anne.

36:42.643 --> 36:44.541
Oh, oh here comes snake guy.

36:46.550 --> 36:48.449
It's hard to track you down.

36:48.458 --> 36:51.356
I heard you spent night...
after Joyce.

36:51.365 --> 36:54.263
you got it backwards for
a change.

36:54.272 --> 36:56.171
This is our friend, Vivian.

36:57.179 --> 36:59.078
-Whose friend?
-My friend.

37:01.087 --> 37:03.000
-I am Darrel.
-How do you do.

37:03.001 --> 37:05.000
You are probably doing better.

37:06.901 --> 37:08.800
So, when we are going to see
you in that new outfit you just bought?

37:10.808 --> 37:13.000
Uh, I barely had the nerve to
buy it...

37:13.001 --> 37:15.614
But Cay convinced me 
to throw caution through the window.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
That is what she is best at.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.429
I think I am going to try
my luck.

37:31.438 --> 37:35.336
Whatever was your intention, 
you accomplished quite the opposite.

37:45.345 --> 37:48.243
I say, Cay steped way out of
her range with that woman.

37:49.252 --> 37:51.150
Do you want a tip?

37:53.159 --> 37:55.000
Change your seat.

38:12.067 --> 38:15.000
-Thank you for really lovely day.
-You are welcome.

38:17.974 --> 38:19.872
Good luck.

38:31.881 --> 38:33.779
Ah, my back is killing me.

38:37.788 --> 38:40.687
Yeah, I was on 6 tranquilisers
before I got here.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.594
The house, the kids,
Gale...all of it.

38:45.603 --> 38:47.501
Really? I am surprised. Your seam
so self assured.

38:48.510 --> 38:50.000
Thank to Buck...

38:50.417 --> 38:53.316
It's amasing what a little "understanding"
will do.

38:53.325 --> 38:56.223
I do. Me and Cay are 
becoming friends and that does help.

38:57.970 --> 39:02.000
Not that it is any of mine concern, 
but you should think twice before

39:02.009 --> 39:04.038
hanging out with her.
You are right, it's not your concern.

39:05.046 --> 39:07.945
Did you know that she was kicked
out of College 

39:07.954 --> 39:09.852
for "unnatural acts" they say?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
Shall I rise up my
eyebrows in gasp?

39:13.768 --> 39:17.667
Well, I am definitely out to lunch 
when it comes to queers. You?

39:18.676 --> 39:21.574
I don't think any of us would be
so limited, Lucille.

39:23.583 --> 39:26.481
Nobody said that it did not
take all kinds, Vivian.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.388
And your are certanly making
a unique contribution.

39:32.397 --> 39:34.296
Hey Buck! Over here!

40:03.305 --> 40:05.203
Are you winning?

40:05.212 --> 40:06.110
Go away.

40:07.119 --> 40:08.017
Yeah.

40:23.026 --> 40:25.925
If you don't play,
you can't win.

40:28.934 --> 40:30.832
Hey, Buck!

40:30.841 --> 40:31.739
Come on.

40:32.748 --> 40:33.647
Good luck.

40:33.655 --> 40:35.554
Enough here. Put your bet.
Come on.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.461
Down the way. Get your bet.
Your time is my time.

40:46.470 --> 40:48.368
Come here, darling.
Change my luck.

40:48.877 --> 40:50.276
No,no. Really,
I don't know how to play this game.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.183
Well, I know how to play it.
And I am down $200.

40:54.192 --> 40:57.090
You just give them a nice shake,
and roll them down.

40:57.099 --> 40:59.000
Put them in the air now.
Let them go.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
And get 7.
Roll 7. Lets go.

41:04.914 --> 41:06.812
That a winner!

41:07.821 --> 41:09.719
That was beautiful, thank you!

41:09.728 --> 41:11.626
Come again.
same lucky lady.

41:12.635 --> 41:13.534
Let's go. Come on.

41:16.934 --> 41:18.832
Winner, winner!

41:19.841 --> 41:21.739
Yeah, yeah again!

41:22.748 --> 41:24.647
Winner. Lucky day.

41:25.458 --> 41:27.356
This time blow.

41:27.365 --> 41:30.263
Like this. And roll.
Roll 7. 

41:37.272 --> 41:39.171
2, and 2.
Not good. Sorry.

41:40.179 --> 41:44.078
I am sorry.
You did fine. Take it.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.000
I can't take it.

41:48.001 --> 41:50.892
Sure you can.
Use it to get married.

41:50.901 --> 41:52.800
Oh. Cash it in!

41:52.808 --> 41:54.707
Cash it in ot not.
What's she gonna do?

41:55.716 --> 41:57.614
Put bet down.
Here we go.

42:47.663 --> 42:48.562
Well...

42:50.570 --> 42:53.469
Pat is having an engagement
party tomorrow night.

42:56.478 --> 42:57.376
I can't say I blame her.

42:59.385 --> 43:04.283
Oh, we shall miss her with all 
this volgars going on.

43:07.292 --> 43:10.191
I made your favorite, pancakes.

43:10.200 --> 43:13.098
You are not going to like it.
In the middle of that circus.

43:13.107 --> 43:14.005
I am not going.

43:15.014 --> 43:16.912
-Sensible.
-Why not?

43:18.921 --> 43:21.820
I have lectures to prepare. I have only 
week and half left.

43:21.829 --> 43:23.727
Come on. Have some fun.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.634
Did Darrel put you off?

43:26.643 --> 43:28.541
Beg your pardon.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.500
Don't fuss. Eat your breakfast and leave 
the woman alone.

43:31.501 --> 43:35.356
It doesn't concern you,
Frances! Honest.

43:36.365 --> 43:38.263
You are skating on thin ice, girl.

43:41.272 --> 43:43.171
I wont you to come.

43:48.179 --> 43:51.078
How can you resist such a 
passionate request?

44:11.087 --> 44:13.985
Vivian, are you Ok?

44:13.994 --> 44:14.892
Walk with me.

44:16.901 --> 44:19.800
I apologize for not stepping
in and taking your side.

44:24.808 --> 44:26.000
I surely wanted to.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.614
-Would you do something for me now?
-Name it and it's yours.

44:30.623 --> 44:32.521
You are a wise observer.

44:32.530 --> 44:35.429
Why does your mother dislike
Cay and I being friends?

44:35.438 --> 44:37.336
She wants Cay all to herself.

44:39.345 --> 44:41.243
Does she mind you and I 
spend time together?

44:42.252 --> 44:44.150
I dont' believe but 
I'll find put.

44:44.159 --> 44:46.058
We are fated to be friends, Walter.

44:47.067 --> 44:49.965
I felt that way since we met.
Care for chicklick?

44:51.000 --> 44:52.872
I'd love one.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.779
Based on what we just said, 
would you reconsider going tomorrow night?

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
No. I don't think I'll be comfortable
celebrating with strangers.

45:04.696 --> 45:07.594
Well, I am pretty sure Cay
can get me invited.

45:08.603 --> 45:11.501
Are you asking me to be your 
date, Walter?

45:10.510 --> 45:13.409
Not exactly my date.

45:13.417 --> 45:16.316
I know planty of girls.
I just ask would you? That is all.

45:16.325 --> 45:19.223
How did you become 
such a gentleman?

45:19.232 --> 45:21.130
The movies.

45:22.139 --> 45:24.038
We'll make an odd couple.
I guarantee you that.

45:25.046 --> 45:27.945
I don't care about
stupid oppinions.

45:39.954 --> 45:41.852
Folks, may I have your attention,
please?

45:42.861 --> 45:44.759
Quiet!

45:45.768 --> 45:49.567
I would like to welcome you 
to this party of Joe Lorenzo.

45:50.676 --> 45:53.574
Special applause for our
star attraction. Miss Silver Dale.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.481
Please stop applauding
because I would like to sing.

46:07.490 --> 46:10.388
I wrote this song last week and
I've been singing it everywere.

46:12.397 --> 46:17.296
I wrote it ...  For everybody
that I love in this room.

46:19.305 --> 46:20.203
Joe!

46:23.212 --> 46:27.110
I am holding you of the gorund
all the time I sing this song.

46:30.119 --> 46:33.017
Ok boys, let's hit it.

46:42.026 --> 46:45.925
I need to find someone 
that is mine.

46:47.934 --> 46:49.832
I've been so lonely.

46:50.841 --> 46:54.739
I've tried a few, wouldn't do.

46:55.748 --> 46:57.647
I am so lonely.

46:58.655 --> 47:02.554
Now I hope these days end...

47:03.563 --> 47:06.461
and better days begin...

47:06.470 --> 47:08.368
I am looking...

47:08.377 --> 47:12.276
for someone to love.

47:14.285 --> 47:18.183
I'll let the spark in my heart.

47:18.192 --> 47:21.090
to flame so bright...

47:22.099 --> 47:25.997
As I feel it burn I start to...

47:27.006 --> 47:30.905
to hold you tight..

47:32.914 --> 47:35.812
I know I gave no sign...

47:36.821 --> 47:39.719
you must have read my mind.

47:40.728 --> 47:43.626
I am looking for

47:42.635 --> 47:46.534
someone to love.

47:47.543 --> 47:50.441
I am looking for

47:51.450 --> 47:53.348
someone

47:54.357 --> 47:57.256
to love.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I love you, Joe!

48:51.172 --> 48:53.070
What are you dreaming about, 
old lady?

48:56.079 --> 48:58.977
Glen and me used to go
dancing here.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I swear that if I was to turn 

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
right now it's like
he would be standing right behind.

49:06.801 --> 49:08.699
Why him and nobody else?

49:11.108 --> 49:13.606
Beacause he reached in and

49:14.615 --> 49:17.514
put a sting of lights right
around my heart.

49:24.523 --> 49:26.421
These days are good and gone.

49:27.430 --> 49:30.328
But you are still the best
dancer in town.

49:31.337 --> 49:33.235
You better believe it.

49:37.500 --> 49:39.143
Thank you

49:40.152 --> 49:42.050
Mrs. Parker, I am cutting in.

49:42.059 --> 49:44.957
Why? You go right ahead.

50:14.766 --> 50:17.864
So, why do you live at the ranch?

50:18.873 --> 50:20.772
It is my hide out.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.679
I know all about hide outs.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.586
What are you hiding from?

50:27.595 --> 50:30.494
Anything I can't handle.

50:31.502 --> 50:33.401
Well, I am relieved to hear that.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.308
You know that I am not alowed
to go over State line?

50:41.317 --> 50:43.215
I tell you what... What?

50:43.224 --> 50:46.123
If any rules get broken, I'll
take the blame, ok?

50:46.131 --> 50:47.030
Ok.

50:48.039 --> 50:50.000
Now, I'll tell you what...

50:50.946 --> 50:54.844
I...would prefer that 
none did.

50:56.853 --> 50:58.752
-Vivian.
-What?

50:58.761 --> 51:00.059
I believe that you are loaded.

51:02.668 --> 51:05.000
I could not imagine doing this
if I was not.

51:06.575 --> 51:08.473
And what are you doing? Haa..

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
-So, how long you've been with Darrel?
-Not long.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.288
What did hapen?

52:07.297 --> 52:10.195
I alowed to myself to get attracted to
what is attraction to me.

52:11.204 --> 52:14.102
-For him, that has been love.
-And for you?

52:15.111 --> 52:18.010
Let's put it this way. I didn't
exactly get a ring.

52:21.019 --> 52:23.917
-How do you get it?
-With the woman.

52:25.500 --> 52:27.000
You are trying to shock me?

52:28.833 --> 52:30.732
No. I was only telling you
the truth.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Did I missled you in any way?

52:34.648 --> 52:36.546
Not for the minute.

52:36.555 --> 52:40.453
Because...you know I
care a lot for you Cat, but...

53:02.462 --> 53:04.361
Roll it all the way down.

53:52.369 --> 53:54.268
You don't have to stop.

53:54.277 --> 53:56.175
I do.

54:08.184 --> 54:10.082
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

54:11.091 --> 54:15.490
I don't know where they came from...
It belongs ... and I

54:17.999 --> 54:19.897
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Take me back.

54:34.813 --> 54:37.711
-I can't seea thing.
-I'll take my chances.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.619
Just drive.

55:08.899 --> 55:10.899
-Are you ok?
-I guess.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.433
Well...Looks like you two
got caught.

55:18.442 --> 55:21.340
We went for a ride to the 
lake after the party.

55:21.349 --> 55:25.248
Must have been quite a sight
to keep you up till now.

55:25.950 --> 55:27.900
Somebody is checking in?

55:25.800 --> 55:29.062
No, somebody is checking out.

55:31.071 --> 55:33.970
I made a reservation at
The Riverside.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.877
Your bags are packed.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.784
I didn't know that leaving the
party would cause concerns.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.791
It also caused talk.
Here is your refund check.

55:47.500 --> 55:50.599
-That was uncalled for.
-Oh, for God sake Francis!

55:50.608 --> 55:52.506
Don't you talk about God, girl!

55:52.515 --> 55:56.413
You made your point, Frances
Just as well. I would leave anyway.

55:56.822 --> 55:58.320
I'll never forgive you for this.

55:59.329 --> 56:02.228
I'll never forgive myself.

56:01.237 --> 56:06.135
Let her come here with her books,
and her influence over my family.

56:06.144 --> 56:08.042
Shut up, Frances!

56:10.925 --> 56:12.949
I can't claim angel wings,

56:14.959 --> 56:16.557
but I am normal.

56:18.818 --> 56:21.764
And when I think... I was 
proud to call you my friend.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.671
May I tell you - betrayal is
mutual.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.579
- I want to do that!
- Walter, bring them here!

56:34.000 --> 56:36.486
Can't you find something
better to do?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.500
Not since you came on the scene.

56:39.577 --> 56:40.500
Get in the house.

56:42.055 --> 56:43.055
Now!

56:56.216 --> 56:58.115
Can I go with you?

56:58.124 --> 57:00.000
I can't.

57:03.531 --> 57:05.929
I'll be at Silver's.
Will you call?

57:09.938 --> 57:10.837
Let's go.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.744
I guess the only was to 
save my plants from

57:38.753 --> 57:42.651
this damm disease is to buy a new one.

57:42.660 --> 57:44.558
I am moving out, Frances.

57:45.567 --> 57:48.466
- Why?
- To get your hands off of my life!

57:50.475 --> 57:54.373
You sound like your father.
Using my place to hang your rat.

57:54.382 --> 57:57.280
You want things without loving them!
That is greed!

57:58.909 --> 58:02.000
Wasn't greed that took you in 
when your mother left you.

58:02.796 --> 58:06.095
It was not greed, it was 
his soul comfort for 10 years!

58:07.104 --> 58:09.002
It is fancy word for what
you really were!

58:12.000 --> 58:14.909
It will be cold day in August
when I take in another educated tart!

58:19.000 --> 58:21.817
She meant something to me.

58:21.425 --> 58:23.724
And you knew it.

58:25.833 --> 58:29.631
She'd broke your heart,
the one I ever...

58:31.940 --> 58:33.538
There is no reason to stay.

58:46.547 --> 58:48.446
Put your sweet lips 

58:49.454 --> 58:51.353
Little closer to the phone...

58:55.362 --> 58:58.260
Let's pretend that we are together...

58:59.269 --> 59:01.167
All alone

59:03.176 --> 59:05.075
I'll tell the man to turn

59:06.084 --> 59:08.982
the jukebox way down low...

59:09.991 --> 59:11.889
Hello

59:17.000 --> 59:19.796
-It's not complete.
-How is that possible?

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Sorry.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.611
-Over for tonight?
-Yes, sure.

59:39.620 --> 59:41.518
Good night.

59:42.527 --> 59:44.425
<i>...mine, I got to know.</i>

59:48.434 --> 59:50.000
Should I hand up

59:50.342 --> 59:52.000
or you'll tell him he
has to go?

59:56.249 --> 01:00:00.000
You can't say the words I want
to hear while.

01:00:00.156 --> 01:00:03.055
you are with other man...

01:00:05.063 --> 01:00:09.000
Do you want me?
Answer yes or no...

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:12.869
Darling, I will understand...

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:17.776
Put your sweet lips 

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:21.684
A little closer to the phone

01:00:23.692 --> 01:00:26.591
Let's pretend that we are togehter 

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.498
all alone.

01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:34.405
I'll tell the man to turn

01:00:36.414 --> 01:00:39.313
the jukebox way down low...

01:00:41.322 --> 01:00:44.220
And you can tell your friend
there with you:

01:00:45.229 --> 01:00:49.127
"You have to go"

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.034
Halo

01:01:58.043 --> 01:02:00.002
No, Mr. Warner, it was 
misunderstanding.

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.849
No, thank you.
Accomodations are just fine here.

01:02:06.858 --> 01:02:09.756
That will not be necessary, mr. Warner,
although I appreciate it.

01:02:10.765 --> 01:02:12.663
If you need to get in touch with
me, I'll be her.

01:02:14.672 --> 01:02:16.571
Thank you. Good bye.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.478
Are you ok?

01:02:49.487 --> 01:02:50.385
I've been better.

01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:53.293
Yes, I know what you mean.

01:02:56.301 --> 01:02:58.200
Why did you come?

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.107
I guess I am scared to death
of not seeing you again.

01:03:04.116 --> 01:03:06.014
Cay, you have to let it go.
You know that.

01:03:09.023 --> 01:03:10.922
Stop it!

01:03:11.931 --> 01:03:14.829
I want you to open the door!

01:03:14.838 --> 01:03:17.736
- And I want you to leave me alone.
- I can't!

01:03:20.745 --> 01:03:21.643
Honestly.

01:03:33.652 --> 01:03:35.551
You look wonderful.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.458
Are you kidding?

01:03:48.467 --> 01:03:51.365
All right, Cay.

01:03:51.374 --> 01:03:53.272
We'll talk.

01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:56.180
You start.

01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:04.087
You kissed me.

01:04:05.096 --> 01:04:06.994
And you kissed me.

01:04:06.003 --> 01:04:09.902
And I kissed you, I know...

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.809
I don't believe what I am saying.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.716
You see...

01:04:17.725 --> 01:04:19.623
I enyoj order.

01:04:23.632 --> 01:04:25.531
What happened between us...

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:29.438
was innocent more than anything else.

01:04:29.447 --> 01:04:31.345
And friendly. Don't forget that one.

01:04:32.354 --> 01:04:36.252
I was really hoping that we can have
mature conversation about this.

01:04:36.261 --> 01:04:41.160
So far we talked about order and
disorder and who kissed whom...

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:44.067
What the hell is it about anyway,
since it was all innocent and friendly.

01:04:45.076 --> 01:04:46.974
Than I'll get to damm point.

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.881
I am a respected scholar.

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:51.789
I've been married many years to
respected scholar.

01:04:52.798 --> 01:04:56.000
And for moment of indiscretion,
fleeding lap of judgement, I...

01:04:56.705 --> 01:04:58.603
stood in the rain and allowed
Frances Parker...

01:04:58.612 --> 01:05:03.510
figure without any resemblance
to anyone in my entire life experience,

01:05:04.519 --> 01:05:06.418
to humiliate us as we were pair 
of deliquents.

01:05:07.427 --> 01:05:08.325
You should have told her off.

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:10.232
I don't have a habit of rising 
my voice.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.140
or false issues.

01:05:15.148 --> 01:05:16.047
When I retire

01:05:16.056 --> 01:05:18.954
I will simply write short stories
for my revenge

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.861
about this town, these 
people, these gamblers...

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
My only clear memory is
arriving.

01:05:32.777 --> 01:05:36.000
The rest is a blur...
Absolute blur.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Oh, God!

01:05:58.592 --> 01:06:00.000
What do you think you
are doing?

01:06:00.499 --> 01:06:01.398
Waiting for you.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.305
I want you tu put your cloths on
and leave.

01:06:15.314 --> 01:06:17.212
-No you don't.
-Yes I do.

01:06:20.221 --> 01:06:21.119
No you don't.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.027
I...

01:06:41.036 --> 01:06:43.934
I wouldn't know what to do.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.841
You can start by putting 
"Do Not disturb" sign on the door.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:04.748
Well...

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:08.656
That part went smoothly.

01:07:12.565 --> 01:07:14.563
So, take your hands out of your
pockets and come here.

01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:37.470
I am not...taking off my robe.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.378
Well, everybody draws the line
somewhere.

01:08:55.086 --> 01:08:56.285
I don't usually...

01:09:01.294 --> 01:09:03.192
feel this way...
it's blocking me.

01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:14.099
I don't know if I felt 
this way ever before.

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:20.507
I am sorry.

01:12:45.315 --> 01:12:47.914
That goes the hot water.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.821
Vivian...

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.728
We have to get out of here,

01:13:07.737 --> 01:13:08.000
you know?

01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:09.000
Stand up...

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.450
-Take a walk.
-I don't...

01:13:13.459 --> 01:13:16.357
Have a coke?
We go shopping?

01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:46.265
You feel sorry?

01:13:48.274 --> 01:13:51.172
-No, I feel exposed.
-Because of me?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.379
And me.

01:13:57.088 --> 01:13:59.987
Do you know how beautiful you
are right now?

01:14:03.795 --> 01:14:05.894
I don't have any references for this.

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:08.801
-I am not great at it either.
-You had the experiences before.

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.708
Not this one.

01:14:13.017 --> 01:14:15.616
My life has always been so
contolled.

01:14:17.224 --> 01:14:19.523
-And it will be again.
-Sure, of course.

01:14:20.532 --> 01:14:23.430
An affair, a divorce.
Nothing to break stripe on.

01:14:24.839 --> 01:14:27.337
-I love you.
-And affair with 25 years old woman on my head.

01:14:28.446 --> 01:14:29.500
I really do.

01:14:29.554 --> 01:14:32.152
I am sure that students and the 
faculty will appreciate that.

01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:35.059
"These things happen".

01:14:37.068 --> 01:14:38.500
I love you, too.

01:14:40.575 --> 01:14:42.874
Compliments of the boys.

01:14:49.183 --> 01:14:51.781
-Let's leave.
-Oh, just relax.

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:53.688
-Check, please!
-We haven't had desert yet.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.595
We'll get desert from 
room service.

01:15:00.604 --> 01:15:02.503
Keep it, boys.
The night is still young.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.410
Bye, honey.

01:15:21.719 --> 01:15:23.000
Oh, come on, I am used to this.

01:15:23.326 --> 01:15:25.225
Well, I am not.

01:15:31.333 --> 01:15:34.132
Listen, you are just visiting
the way I live.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.539
It suites you fine to hide in that
hotel room till your train leaves.

01:15:39.048 --> 01:15:41.000
By all means, let's hide.

01:15:42.155 --> 01:15:45.000
You are so insisting that 
everyone see the things you do.

01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:47.761
Oh, yeah, made it really
like that in your apartment.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
No fear, no confusion.
So selfasured.

01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:53.668
I don't act that way to change the world,
but to goddamm world not change me!

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
-Low your voice!
-Why? is this a false issue?

01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:01.500
Is there some way to make
this easier?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Da

01:16:06.099 --> 01:16:08.297
You take the car and I'll walk.

01:16:08.306 --> 01:16:10.204
That is easiest as it gets.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.000
Does it have to turn
around this quickly?

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.019
Comes with the territory.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.526
-I'll walk!
-Its 18 km, Vivian.

01:16:29.535 --> 01:16:32.000
Good!
Maybe it will wake me up!

01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:33.741
Do you need me the way I need 
you?

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.648
Yes. You know I do.

01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:15.555
Hello. Sorry I am late.
Walter couldn't find parking place.

01:18:19.364 --> 01:18:22.463
Oh, Silver, you are gorgious.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.370
-Come on.
-How long will it last?

01:18:30.879 --> 01:18:31.277
5 minutes

01:18:42.286 --> 01:18:45.184
-I am glad to see you, Walter.
-I am glad to see you.

01:18:47.193 --> 01:18:49.092
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.000
Good morning.
Its Joe and Silvia.

01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:53.906
Silver!

01:18:54.915 --> 01:18:57.813
Well, Joe and Silver,
where are you, nice people, from?

01:18:57.982 --> 01:19:01.001
-Brooklyn.
-Charlottesville, Texas.

01:19:01.730 --> 01:19:03.628
All pretty girl
are from there.

01:19:04.237 --> 01:19:07.535
Now I will call upon gentleman upstairs
for a very special blessing for you.

01:19:19.444 --> 01:19:21.442
-See me faint?
-I cried all the way through.

01:19:21.451 --> 01:19:23.350
It was really best.

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.257
Cay is the best.

01:19:31.173 --> 01:19:33.071
Don't say I've never 
gave you anything.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.979
- Have a good trip.
-I see you in New York.

01:19:39.988 --> 01:19:40.886
Yes you will.

01:19:51.595 --> 01:19:54.000
Too bad that things didn't 
work out different.

01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:24.701
Truth is that you don't 
own me one damm thing!

01:20:26.309 --> 01:20:28.608
I have nothnig to hang on to
you any more.

01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:31.000
I love you, Frances.

01:20:35.724 --> 01:20:37.422
I'll never accept what you do.

01:20:39.331 --> 01:20:40.330
I know.

01:20:44.338 --> 01:20:46.237
I just don't understand.

01:20:48.246 --> 01:20:49.500
Two women together!

01:20:50.153 --> 01:20:52.051
She just reached in

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.959
and laid a string of
light in my heart.

01:20:58.468 --> 01:20:59.000
Don't keep her waiting.

01:20:59.775 --> 01:21:02.773
Oh, Frances, be happy for someone 
in your life.

01:21:12.582 --> 01:21:13.680
Oh, God!

01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:18.588
Look at us!
Standing in the middle of the street.

01:21:20.897 --> 01:21:22.495
Next thing you know they be
talking about me.

01:21:37.004 --> 01:21:39.402
Is that it, then?

01:21:40.211 --> 01:21:42.310
I know you longer than 
anybody in my life.

01:21:44.818 --> 01:21:45.217
What does that mean?

01:21:47.226 --> 01:21:49.124
That will never be it.

01:22:22.933 --> 01:22:24.031
Well, congratulations, Vivian.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.939
You return to New York
as a free woman.

01:22:29.347 --> 01:22:31.846
Unless, of course, some
fellow here have stolen your heart.

01:22:33.555 --> 01:22:36.753
-How about a drink, to celebrate?
-I'd love to. But I have other plans.

01:22:36.762 --> 01:22:38.660
Ok, I am sorry. I think I
understand.

01:22:39.969 --> 01:22:41.000
You look different.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:44.475
I see, you have found yourself
a new pin pal.

01:22:44.484 --> 01:22:46.382
No, I have much more than
that, Mr. Warner.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.289
Thank you.

01:22:51.398 --> 01:22:52.197
Good luck to you.

01:23:03.706 --> 01:23:05.104
Can I talk you in to stay one
more day?

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.011
-Yes.
-Do you want me to?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
No.

01:23:11.127 --> 01:23:13.000
-I'll come back.
-When?

01:23:12.835 --> 01:23:14.000
Christmas.

01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.640
Christmas?

01:23:16.849 --> 01:23:19.000
-I don't know what you want.
-It's you I want.

01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:35.000
Cay?

01:23:36.464 --> 01:23:37.362
You are not coming?

01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:40.000
I'll see you at the station.

01:23:40.978 --> 01:23:42.000
Can we have dinner?

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:44.000
No.

01:23:45.093 --> 01:23:46.591
Why?

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.918
Because being with you is 
starting to hurt.

01:23:55.627 --> 01:23:56.826
I want...

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I want to say goodbye alone.

01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:05.640
We have been saying goodbye
from the begining.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.548
I gotta go.

01:25:29.956 --> 01:25:33.455
-I put sugar...
-I won't start.

01:25:37.064 --> 01:25:39.462
-I got another postcard from Silver today.
-How are they?

01:25:40.471 --> 01:25:42.269
Aren't all honeymoon cards
the same?

01:25:43.178 --> 01:25:46.577
"Incredible divine. Just like
a movie set. We'll never come back".

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.084
-Come with me.
-oh, sure thing.

01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:53.000
Can you really picture me with 
you?

01:25:53.002 --> 01:25:55.898
If you want a sure thing, 
stay in Reno.

01:25:56.607 --> 01:25:59.806
As for my friends
I endured an hour with them...

01:26:01.315 --> 01:26:02.413
Gwen.

01:26:04.422 --> 01:26:06.620
It's a nice offer, Vivian.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.527
but there are still...a few 
losse ends...

01:26:09.536 --> 01:26:11.435
-At least.

01:26:11.444 --> 01:26:13.342
-Than, why did you make it?

01:26:13.451 --> 01:26:15.249
Because I care about you.

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:18.156
Because I think that you 
diserve to live somwhere with...

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:23.064
or near someone who sees how
wonderful you are.

01:26:24.173 --> 01:26:26.971
Know exactly who you are.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.878
"All on board!"

01:26:29.087 --> 01:26:32.000
That is why I'll never
finish this conversation.

01:26:37.794 --> 01:26:39.693
If it didn't please you, you
wouldn't have to stay.

01:26:42.802 --> 01:26:44.600
Well, we'll talk about that
one of these days.

01:26:45.309 --> 01:26:48.507
Come with me to the next station.

01:26:48.616 --> 01:26:50.415
-What can we settle in 40 minutes?
-I'll talk fast.

01:26:54.502 --> 01:26:56.500
Send me a postcard when you get there.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
-What is it that you want?
-Another 40 minutes with you.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000
