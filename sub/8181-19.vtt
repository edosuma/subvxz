00:34.900 --> 00:35.983
HAPPY 40TH, DOUGLAS.

00:36.051 --> 00:37.985
OH, WOW. HEY.

00:38.053 --> 00:39.337
HERE WE GO.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.475
"WELCOME TO STEREO."

00:43.543 --> 00:45.077
IT'S MARVELOUS.

00:45.144 --> 00:47.446
YOU HEAR A BOWLING BALL
ROLLING IN ONE SPEAKER

00:47.513 --> 00:50.482
AND THE PINS FALLING DOWN
IN THE OTHER.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.219
I THINK WE'VE FOUND
OUR NEW MAKE-OUT ALBUM.

00:57.122 --> 00:59.457
OK, THIS ONE'S
FROM DANNY.

00:59.525 --> 01:00.659
OK.

01:00.726 --> 01:02.610
YEAH, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO GET YOU.

01:02.678 --> 01:05.163
THEN I WALKED BY
LAZY EDDIE'S.

01:07.199 --> 01:09.100
THE GRASPER?

01:09.185 --> 01:11.352
YEAH. YOU USE IT
TO PICK UP STUFF.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.739
AND THE FIRST PART
OF MY BODY HAS BEEN REPLACED.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.609
OH!

01:17.676 --> 01:20.011
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

01:20.029 --> 01:23.181
REACHING WAS THE ONLY
CARDIO HE HAD LEFT.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.988
OH, YOU CAN JUST PUT THOSE
IN THE SINK. THANKS.

01:30.055 --> 01:31.389
OK.

01:31.457 --> 01:34.075
SO HAS DOUG BEEN FREAKING
OUT ABOUT TURNING 40?

01:34.143 --> 01:35.777
NO. HE'S DOING FINE.

01:35.844 --> 01:39.714
OH. MY HUSBAND MATT
TOTALLY WENT TO PIECES.

01:39.782 --> 01:41.065
REALLY?

01:41.133 --> 01:42.384
YEAH. IT WAS ROUGH
FOR A WHILE,

01:42.535 --> 01:45.303
BUT IT ENDED UP BEING JUST THE
KICK IN THE PANTS HE NEEDED.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.639
HE GOT BACK INTO SHAPE.
HE STARTED HIS OWN BUSINESS.

01:48.707 --> 01:51.810
OH. AND HE'S TAKING ME
TO PARIS NEXT MONTH.

01:53.212 --> 01:54.745
HUH.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.554
HEY, UH, DO YOU HAVE
ANY MARSHMALLOWS?

02:03.622 --> 02:06.624
DOUG WANTS TO SEE IF HE CAN
CATCH 'EM WITH THE GRASPER.

02:06.692 --> 02:08.425
UPPER RIGHT CABINET.
OK.

02:08.493 --> 02:11.662
BUT DON'T USE 'EM ALL, 'CAUSE
THAT'S HOW I GIVE HIM HIS LIPITOR.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.664
HEY, DEAC, UH,

02:13.732 --> 02:16.334
DOUG'S TAKING 40
IN STRIDE, HUH?

02:16.402 --> 02:17.952
OH, YEAH.

02:18.020 --> 02:20.137
'CAUSE I KNOW SOME GUYS THIS
AGE, THEY START FREAKING OUT.

02:20.205 --> 02:22.374
THEY START WONDERING,
"AM I HAPPY WHERE I AM?

02:22.441 --> 02:26.110
IS THIS ALL THERE IS?"
WHY ISN'T HE FREAKING OUT?

02:26.178 --> 02:27.194
I DON'T KNOW.

02:27.262 --> 02:29.497
'CAUSE, I MEAN, HE SHOULD BE.
SHOULDN'T HE?

02:29.564 --> 02:32.417
HE CAN'T BE HAPPY
WITH WHERE HE IS IN HIS LIFE.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.087
GOING TO WORK IN SHORT PANTS AND
LUGGING AROUND PACKAGES TO PEOPLE.

02:36.154 --> 02:39.090
UH-HUH. YOU KNOW
I DO THE SAME THING.

02:43.562 --> 02:44.662
YES.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.864
BUT YOU ARE NOT 40.

02:46.932 --> 02:49.401
I TURN 39 NEXT MONTH.

02:49.468 --> 02:50.318
REALLY?
YEAH.

02:50.385 --> 02:51.903
WELL, YOU LOOK SUPER.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.506
THANKS. MAYBE HE DOES HAVE
SOME STUFF GOING ON.

02:54.573 --> 02:57.208
IT'S PROBABLY JUST ALL
BOTTLED UP INSIDE.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.686
DEEP INSIDE.

03:08.754 --> 03:11.122
MM-HMM.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.060
WELL, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY.

03:16.128 --> 03:18.162
THANKS.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.531
MMM!

03:19.599 --> 03:22.434
OH! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

03:22.501 --> 03:25.519
I JUST HAD A HANDFUL
OF THESE SEXY PILLS

03:25.587 --> 03:27.438
THAT SPENCE GAVE ME.

03:27.506 --> 03:30.040
AND, UH-WHOA.
IT'S KICKING IN.

03:32.177 --> 03:35.346
THAT'S CUTE, BABY.
THAT'S CUTE.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.648
SO ARE THINGS ALL GOOD?

03:36.716 --> 03:37.716
YEAH. WHY?

03:37.783 --> 03:39.718
WELL, JUST THAT IT
IS THE BIG 4-0.

03:39.785 --> 03:42.053
AND I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS
WHEN THEY GET THIS AGE,

03:42.121 --> 03:44.623
THEY START HAVING
SOME REGRETS.

03:44.674 --> 03:45.690
WHAT ABOUT?

03:45.757 --> 03:47.892
OH, ABOUT, UH... YOU KNOW,

03:47.960 --> 03:49.460
YOUR LIFE,

03:49.528 --> 03:52.730
YOUR JOB, THINGS
YOU WISH YOU'D DONE.

03:52.798 --> 03:54.666
ACTUALLY,
NOW THAT YOU SAY IT,

03:54.734 --> 03:57.435
I KIND OF WISH
I CALLED IN SICK TODAY.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.253
COME ON. I'M TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU HERE.

03:59.321 --> 04:01.756
YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT ME, AREN'T YOU?

04:01.807 --> 04:05.143
YES. SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT OR WORK ON,

04:05.210 --> 04:07.111
I AM HERE FOR YOU.

04:07.179 --> 04:10.699
CARRIE, I AM HAPPY.
I DON'T HAVE A SINGLE REGRET.

04:10.766 --> 04:13.001
I MEAN, I'VE ACCOMPLISHED
MORE IN MY LIFE

04:13.069 --> 04:16.303
THAN I'D EVER
THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

04:19.925 --> 04:21.459
WELL...

04:21.527 --> 04:22.727
GOOD.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.084
MORNING.

04:30.152 --> 04:32.687
HEY. I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

04:32.755 --> 04:34.923
"IS THERE ANYTHING
I WISH I HAD DONE?"

04:34.990 --> 04:36.374
AND I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

04:36.441 --> 04:38.142
REALLY? WHAT IS IT?

04:38.210 --> 04:41.262
I WANNA RIDE GOLIATH.

04:41.329 --> 04:43.531
WHAT'S THAT?

04:43.599 --> 04:45.700
IT'S THIS HUGE ROLLER COASTER
AT THRILL MOUNTAIN.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.735
WHEN IT FIRST OPENED UP,
MY DAD AND I, WE WENT THERE,

04:47.803 --> 04:49.804
AND WE WAITED ON LINE
FOR LIKE 2 AND A HALF HOURS.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.840
WHEN I FINALLY GOT TO THE FRONT,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HA-

04:52.908 --> 04:55.209
I JUST GOT SCARED
AND I RAN OFF.

04:55.277 --> 04:56.945
I CAN'T DO IT.

04:57.012 --> 05:00.347
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE, THIS 10-YEAR-OLD
KID'S GOING ON A THIRD TIME.

05:00.415 --> 05:02.750
I'LL BE IN
CAPTAIN JACK'S FISH YARD.

05:06.721 --> 05:08.656
NOT A DAY GOES BY

05:08.723 --> 05:11.392
THAT I DON'T REGRET MY DECISION
TO GET OUT OF THAT LINE.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.212
THAT'S A LOT
TO LIVE WITH, HON.

05:14.213 --> 05:15.946
YEAH. SO I'M
THINKING SATURDAY.

05:16.048 --> 05:17.815
YEAH. SATURDAY.
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.851
WAIT A SECOND. YOU GOT
A LITTLE LINT. LITTLE LINT.

05:19.918 --> 05:21.085
OK, STOP IT.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.337
IT'S MINE NOW.
HEY, IT'S GRASPER!

05:23.389 --> 05:24.756
YEAH. OK. GOOD.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.460
COME ON. I NEED THAT
FOR THE DRIVE-THROUGH.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.534
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

05:36.602 --> 05:38.536
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE
CARRIE A LITTLE EXTRA SPACE

05:38.604 --> 05:40.104
THESE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:40.172 --> 05:41.739
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:41.874 --> 05:43.591
I WAS TALKING TO HER
AT YOUR BIRTHDAY YESTERDAY,

05:43.659 --> 05:47.061
AND I THINK SHE KIND OF WISHES
YOU WANTED MORE OUT OF LIFE,

05:47.129 --> 05:50.965
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
AMOUNTED TO VERY MUCH.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.818
SHE... SHE WANTS ME
TO HAVE A MIDLIFE CRISIS?

05:53.952 --> 05:56.187
PRETTY MUCH.
YOU READY TO GO?

05:56.288 --> 05:58.723
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO GET ME TO IMPROVE MYSELF

05:58.791 --> 06:01.059
TO GET A BETTER LIFE FOR HER.

06:01.126 --> 06:02.727
SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE.

06:02.794 --> 06:04.529
ACTUALLY, SHE KIND
OF GOT ME THINKING.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.931
I'M GONNA APPLY FOR THAT
I.P.S. MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

06:06.998 --> 06:08.332
WHY DON'T YOU
DO IT WITH ME?

06:08.400 --> 06:12.019
WHY DON'T YOU SACK UP
AND FIGHT THE POWER, NANCY?

06:12.087 --> 06:14.622
ALL I'M SAYING IS
THIS THING AIN'T GOING AWAY.

06:14.690 --> 06:16.224
I'LL DEAL WITH IT,
BELIEVE ME.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.509
SHE WANTS A CRISIS, I'LL WHIP
SOMETHING UP. SHUT THE DOOR.

06:43.936 --> 06:45.870
DOUG, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.606
NOTHING.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

06:48.674 --> 06:49.490
OK.

06:54.346 --> 06:56.547
H- H-HATE MYSELF!

07:00.952 --> 07:03.387
ARE YOU OK?

07:03.455 --> 07:05.556
YEAH. I'M GREAT.

07:05.607 --> 07:07.374
I'M 40 YEARS OLD AND WHAT
HAVE I DONE IN MY LIFE REALLY?

07:07.442 --> 07:09.443
WHERE AM I GOING WITH
MY LIFE? WHAT AM I DOING?

07:09.495 --> 07:12.730
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU
SAID YOU WERE OK WITH BEING 40.

07:12.748 --> 07:15.867
YEAH. THE NILE AIN'T JUST
A RIVER IN SPAIN, CARRIE.

07:20.572 --> 07:21.872
I JUST...

07:21.940 --> 07:24.742
I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT
YOU SAID THE OTHER NIGHT.

07:24.809 --> 07:26.511
I DON'T KNOW.

07:26.562 --> 07:28.746
WHAT IS THIS?

07:28.797 --> 07:31.799
I WAS MAKING A LIST
OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.952
OH, WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING ON
HERE. LET'S SEE WHAT IT SAYS.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.721
"GET BUTTERFINGERS."

07:45.631 --> 07:48.298
THAT WAS...
THAT WAS FOR ME.

07:49.451 --> 07:51.418
OH, BABY, COME ON.

07:51.453 --> 07:54.305
MY... MY GOD, YOU'RE SOAKED.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.941
GREAT. NOW I'M A FAILURE AND I
CAN'T CONTROL MY SWEAT GLANDS.

07:57.008 --> 07:59.109
YOU ARE NOT
A FAILURE, OK?

07:59.177 --> 08:01.746
YOU ARE A VERY SMART,
TALENTED GUY

08:01.813 --> 08:04.465
WHO COULD DO ANYTHING
HE PUTS HIS MIND TO.

08:04.532 --> 08:05.800
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

08:05.868 --> 08:07.018
YES.

08:07.085 --> 08:09.854
WELL, ALL I WANNA
DO IS JUST...

08:09.922 --> 08:11.756
I WANNA GIVE YOU
A BETTER LIFE.

08:11.823 --> 08:14.125
AND I WANT A BETTER LIFE.

08:15.444 --> 08:17.378
I WANNA BUY YOU
A BIGGER HOUSE.

08:17.446 --> 08:19.980
I WANNA TAKE YOU AROUND THE WORLD
AND GIVE YOU THE BEST OF EVERYTHING.

08:20.048 --> 08:21.315
YES, HONEY! OK!

08:21.383 --> 08:23.818
YOU KNOW WHAT?
STARTING RIGHT NOW.

08:23.885 --> 08:25.303
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

08:25.370 --> 08:26.937
I'M QUITTING MY JOB.

08:27.005 --> 08:29.340
WHA-WHAT?
YOU'RE QUITTING YOUR JOB?

08:29.408 --> 08:32.994
IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT TO THE
TOP, I CAN'T THINK LIKE A DONKEY.

08:33.061 --> 08:35.596
I NEED TIME
TO PLAN MY COURSE.

08:35.664 --> 08:36.714
OK. HOW MUCH TIME?

08:36.780 --> 08:38.048
6 MONTHS, A YEAR.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.484
YOU CANNOT PUT A CLOCK
ON GREATNESS.

08:40.552 --> 08:43.755
HOW MUCH A LASIK SURGEON
PULL DOWN, YOU THINK?

08:43.822 --> 08:45.640
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S SLOW DOWN HERE.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.608
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN ME THEN. YOU DON'T.

08:47.676 --> 08:50.444
I DO. I DO.
I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.

08:50.512 --> 08:53.063
IT'S JUST THAT NOW I THINK...
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:53.131 --> 08:56.601
OUR LIFE IS GREAT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

08:56.668 --> 08:58.335
SO YOU WANT ME
NOT TO QUIT MY JOB

08:58.403 --> 09:00.972
AND EVERYTHING JUST STAY
THE SAME THE WAY IT IS

09:01.040 --> 09:03.474
AND NOT CHANGE THE MAJOR
PARTS OF MY LIFE.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.409
NO. NOT RIGHT NOW.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.414
WHAT-WHATEVER
MY BABY WANTS.

09:19.775 --> 09:21.893
$42 TO GET IN.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.728
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD RIDE
THE ROLLER COASTER FOR 10 CENTS,

09:24.797 --> 09:26.730
AND IT'D TAKE YOU
ANYWHERE IN THE CITY.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.000
ARTHUR, I THINK
THAT'S THE SUBWAY.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.634
WHAT HAPPENED TO CARRIE?

09:30.702 --> 09:33.004
OH, SHE'S OVER THERE
GETTING A COBRA TATTOO.

09:33.071 --> 09:34.605
THOUGHT IT'D BE HOT.

09:34.673 --> 09:36.607
HOW'D YOU GET HER
TO DO THAT?

09:36.675 --> 09:38.742
I JUST THREATENED TO CRY
AND BECOME A CARPENTER.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.245
WOW. YOU'RE REALLY MILKING THIS
WHOLE MIDLIFE CRISIS THING, HUH?

09:41.313 --> 09:43.781
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
NOW I'M HAPPY. SHE'S HAPPY.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.833
LISTEN. BY THE WAY,
IF IT COMES UP,

09:45.901 --> 09:47.918
I THREW CARRIE
A LITTLE BONE.

09:47.986 --> 09:51.455
I TOLD HER O'BOYLE WAS RECOMMENDING
ME FOR THAT BOSS SCHOOL.

09:51.523 --> 09:52.639
THE MANAGEMENT
TRAINING PROGRAM.

09:52.707 --> 09:55.026
WHATEVER. POINT IS, TUESDAY
NIGHTS FROM 7:00 TO 9:00,

09:55.094 --> 09:56.694
I'M NOT AT THE MOVIES.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.895
HUH?

09:57.963 --> 09:59.580
HEY.

09:59.648 --> 10:01.966
THIS THING DOES
COME OFF, RIGHT?

10:02.034 --> 10:04.869
I HOPE NOT, 'CAUSE
I COULDN'T WANT YOU MORE.

10:04.936 --> 10:06.370
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

10:06.438 --> 10:08.706
WELL, DANNY AND I ARE GONNA
HIT THE HAUNTED CASTLE.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.975
YEAH. SCARED CHICKS
ARE VERY APPROACHABLE.

10:11.042 --> 10:13.177
AND I'M TAKING MAJOR
TO THE KIDS ZONE.

10:13.244 --> 10:15.846
OH, OK. SO WE'LL JUST
MEET BACK HERE AT 2:00.

10:15.914 --> 10:17.715
ALL RIGHT?
SOUNDS GOOD.

10:19.718 --> 10:21.518
WAIT A MINUTE.

10:21.586 --> 10:22.920
WHO'S GONNA TAKE MY DAD?

10:22.938 --> 10:24.238
I DON'T NEED A CARETAKER.

10:24.306 --> 10:26.240
JUST POINT ME IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE BEARDED LADY,

10:26.308 --> 10:27.708
AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.

10:27.776 --> 10:30.244
DAD, I DON'T WANT YOU
OFF ON YOUR OWN.

10:30.312 --> 10:32.246
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
TAKE HIM WITH US.

10:32.314 --> 10:33.814
HE CAN'T GET
ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

10:33.882 --> 10:35.816
HE'S GOT BLADDER ISSUES, AND
HE UNLATCHES THE SAFETY BAR.

10:35.884 --> 10:37.551
DEAC.

10:37.619 --> 10:40.821
OH, WELL, WE'RE GOING ON THE
MERRY-GO-ROUND. I'M SURE ARTHUR-

10:40.889 --> 10:42.623
I LOVE THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.

10:44.225 --> 10:48.095
WELL, GREAT. HAVE FUN, AND
DON'T LET HIM HAVE ANY CHOCOLATE.

10:48.163 --> 10:50.564
OK? BYE.

10:50.632 --> 10:55.285
COME ON, MAJOR. DID YOU KNOW, AS
A YOUNG MAN, I WORKED AS A CARNY?

10:55.353 --> 11:00.758
ONE DAY, I HAD TO HOLD A MAN'S
SEVERED LEG FOR FIVE HOURS.

11:11.870 --> 11:12.803
COME ON.

11:12.871 --> 11:16.407
BUDDY, SETTLE DOWN.

11:16.474 --> 11:18.643
WHY IS THE LINE SO LONG?

11:18.710 --> 11:21.128
GET USED TO IT.
LIFE IS ONE LONG LINE.

11:21.196 --> 11:23.831
EXCEPT AT THE END OF IT,
THERE AIN'T NO MERRY-GO-ROUND.

11:23.898 --> 11:25.716
DO YOU MIND, ARTHUR?

11:25.784 --> 11:29.086
LOOK, PARTNER, WHY DON'T WE GET
ON SOMETHING THAT'S NOT SO LONG?

11:29.154 --> 11:31.105
LIKE THE HALL OF NUTRITION.

11:31.173 --> 11:32.723
NO. I WANNA GO
ON THE HORSES.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.877
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU

11:36.945 --> 11:39.380
I COULD GET THE THREE OF US
TO THE FRONT OF THIS LINE

11:39.448 --> 11:42.115
AND EVERY OTHER LINE
IN THIS PARK?

11:42.183 --> 11:43.367
HMM?

11:53.378 --> 11:55.313
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

11:55.380 --> 11:57.514
YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING
A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR?

11:57.582 --> 11:59.333
THEN DON'T SEND ME
TO KOREA.

11:59.401 --> 12:01.068
YOU'RE WELCOME
FOR YOUR FREEDOM.

12:01.136 --> 12:02.670
RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR.

12:06.307 --> 12:08.191
GREAT CALL
ON THE BIRD SHOW.

12:08.259 --> 12:10.260
THEY SAID THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE CHICKS WOULD BE.

12:10.328 --> 12:12.262
YEAH. REAL CHICKS
IN A NEST.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.665
OK. NOW WE KNOW.

12:20.288 --> 12:22.656
HI. CAN I HAVE
A CHERRY ICE?

12:26.862 --> 12:28.796
OH, HELLO, MISS.

12:28.864 --> 12:31.215
HOW BERRY NICE TO SEE YOU.

12:33.668 --> 12:36.387
AH. GOD, THIS ALL
LOOKS SO GOOD.

12:36.455 --> 12:39.490
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SURPRISE ME.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.892
BUT, UM,
NOTHING WITH PEANUTS,

12:41.960 --> 12:44.462
OR MY HEAD WILL BLOW UP
BIGGER THAN YOURS.

12:50.218 --> 12:53.337
I THINK THE, UH, ICE
CREAM CONE KIND OF DIGS ME.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.405
WHAT?

12:54.473 --> 12:55.973
YEAH. YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE TOUCHED MY ARM?

12:56.041 --> 12:58.476
THERE'S A DEFINITE VIBE
BETWEEN US.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.211
YOU'RE GETTIN' A VIBE FROM
A GIANT ICE CREAM CONE?

13:01.279 --> 13:03.247
SHH, SHH. HERE SHE COMES.

13:04.482 --> 13:06.017
OH!

13:06.084 --> 13:08.836
CHOCO CRUNCH. HOW DID YOU
KNOW THAT WAS MY FAVORITE?

13:15.577 --> 13:19.813
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:38.266 --> 13:40.267
WELCOME TO GOLIATH,

13:40.335 --> 13:44.104
145 SECONDS
OF WHITE-KNUCKLE FURY.

13:44.172 --> 13:48.542
PLEASE SECURE ALL SUNGLASSES,
CELL PHONES

13:48.610 --> 13:50.911
AND CAMERAS.

13:50.978 --> 13:52.379
ENJOY THE RIDE.

13:53.948 --> 13:57.250
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D BE
NERVOUS WHEN I SAW IT AGAIN.

13:57.319 --> 13:59.753
BUT I GUESS
WHEN YOU'RE 25 YEARS OLD,

13:59.821 --> 14:01.422
THE WHOLE WORLD LOOKS BIGGER.

14:01.489 --> 14:04.157
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

14:05.660 --> 14:08.161
HEY, IF IT ISN'T
THE HEFFERNANS.

14:08.229 --> 14:09.180
HI, MR. O'BOYLE.

14:09.331 --> 14:10.998
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:11.065 --> 14:13.050
WELL, I HEARD YOU AND
PALMER TALKING ABOUT IT,

14:13.118 --> 14:15.052
SO I FIGURED
I'D BRING THE BOYS.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.554
YOU REMEMBER SANJI,
PATRICK, JR.

14:17.622 --> 14:19.673
A COUPLE OF LADY-KILLERS
YOU GOT THERE, HUH?

14:19.741 --> 14:21.358
THEY DO ALL RIGHT.

14:21.426 --> 14:22.826
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD
WE BUMPED INTO YOU

14:22.895 --> 14:25.729
BECAUSE I WANNA SAY THANK
YOU FOR RECOMMENDING DOUG.

14:25.797 --> 14:27.564
HE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

14:27.632 --> 14:28.682
RECOMMENDED FOR WHAT?

14:28.749 --> 14:29.850
WHOA. WE'RE MOVING.
THE LINE'S MOVING.

14:29.917 --> 14:30.968
HERE WE GO. KEEP IT UP.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.504
LET'S GO, FOLKS. KEEP IT
ROLLIN'. I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

14:34.572 --> 14:35.890
ARTHUR, COME ON, MAN.

14:35.957 --> 14:37.858
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU COULDN'T
HAVE COME IN HERE YOURSELF.

14:37.926 --> 14:39.026
BECAUSE IF ANYONE
SEES ME WALKING,

14:39.093 --> 14:40.528
WE'LL BE THROWN OUT
ON OUR EARS.

14:40.595 --> 14:44.398
FINE. JUST GO AHEAD
SO WE CAN HIT THE LOG FLUME.

14:44.465 --> 14:46.033
OH.

14:47.485 --> 14:50.921
BACON IS IN THE PAN.

14:50.989 --> 14:52.156
HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

14:52.223 --> 14:56.142
FINE, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
MY LEGS ARE UTTERLY USELESS.

14:56.210 --> 14:59.913
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE ABOUT
BEING A VETERAN. AND THANK YOU.

14:59.981 --> 15:03.667
WELL, COMING FROM A FELLOW MAN
IN UNIFORM, THAT MEANS A LOT.

15:07.856 --> 15:10.191
OK, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO CARRY ME IN THERE.

15:10.258 --> 15:13.060
WHAT? I'M NOT DOING THAT.
JUST WAIT FOR HIM TO LEAVE.

15:13.128 --> 15:15.379
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.416
SON...

15:18.483 --> 15:20.151
LOOK AWAY.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.473
SO LET'S HEAD OVER
TO THE KIDS ZONE.

15:26.541 --> 15:29.743
MAYBE WE COULD PICK UP
SOME SINGLE MOMS.

15:29.811 --> 15:31.912
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

15:31.979 --> 15:33.447
I'M-I'M-I'M SORRY.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.816
I JUST... I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER.

15:35.883 --> 15:37.551
WHO? THE ICE CREAM CONE?

15:37.619 --> 15:39.336
AW, MAN.
YOU GOT TO LET THAT GO.

15:39.404 --> 15:41.555
YOU'RE STARTING
TO CREEP ME OUT HERE.

15:41.623 --> 15:42.739
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY,

15:42.807 --> 15:45.209
BUT I THINK
SHE MAY BE THE ONE.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.495
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
SHE MIGHT BE? A DUDE.

15:48.563 --> 15:50.814
OH, PLEASE. I THINK I KNOW
THE FEEL OF A MAN'S TOUCH,

15:50.882 --> 15:53.150
AND THIS DEFINITELY
WASN'T IT.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.436
OK. EVEN IF IT IS A GIRL,

15:55.503 --> 15:58.272
YOU GOT TO FIGURE THEY DON'T
PUT THE HOT ONES IN A MASK.

15:58.339 --> 16:00.941
NONE OF THAT MATTERS NOW.
WE HAD A CONNECTION.

16:01.008 --> 16:03.910
I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT SLIP
THROUGH MY FINGERS. I'M NOT.

16:05.797 --> 16:08.849
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

16:08.916 --> 16:11.135
BUT FROM THE MOMENT
I MET YOU,

16:11.203 --> 16:13.937
I JUST FEEL LIKE-

16:14.005 --> 16:16.607
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT HER.
YOU'RE CHOCOLATE.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.877
WHERE'S
THE STRAWBERRY CONE?

16:19.944 --> 16:21.511
WHERE IS SHE?

16:48.874 --> 16:49.874
WELCOME TO GOLIATH,

16:49.941 --> 16:52.176
145 SECONDS
OF WHITE-KNUCKLE FURY.

16:52.244 --> 16:55.545
PLEASE SECURE ALL CAMERAS,
SUNGLASSES, AND CELL PHONES.

16:55.613 --> 16:56.747
ENJOY THE RIDE.

16:56.814 --> 16:59.183
I'LL SECURE MY CAMERA
DOWN HIS THROAT.

17:00.985 --> 17:02.386
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:02.453 --> 17:04.387
WHY DON'T WE JUST GO OUT
AND DO SOMETHING ELSE?

17:04.454 --> 17:06.390
WHAT? WE'VE BEEN IN LINE
FOR LIKE 2 HOURS.

17:06.457 --> 17:08.458
COME ON, BABY. WE GOT
TO CONQUER THIS FEAR. OK?

17:08.526 --> 17:10.627
EVEN GETTING THIS FAR
IS A BIG STEP FOR ME.

17:10.694 --> 17:13.696
HEY, LET'S GO SEE HOW BIG
I LOOK IN THE HOUSE OF MIRRORS.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.867
HEY, IT'S
YOU GUYS AGAIN, HUH?

17:16.935 --> 17:19.603
WHAT WERE YOU
THANKING ME ABOUT BEFORE?

17:19.670 --> 17:21.472
OH. UM,
I WAS THANKING YOU

17:21.539 --> 17:23.890
FOR GETTING DOUG INTO
THAT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

17:23.958 --> 17:24.674
WHAT?

17:24.776 --> 17:26.108
THE LINE'S MOVING AGAIN.

17:26.176 --> 17:27.911
WHOA. I'M SORRY. SHE'S
ALL RIGHT. SHE'S TOUGH.

17:27.979 --> 17:29.313
LADY, KEEP MOVING.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.047
WHAT IS GOING ON?

17:31.115 --> 17:33.717
I NEVER SIGNED UP FOR
THE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, OK?

17:33.785 --> 17:36.019
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I LIKE MY LIFE.

17:36.087 --> 17:37.270
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CRISIS?

17:37.338 --> 17:38.638
THERE WAS NO CRISIS, OK?

17:38.706 --> 17:41.075
DEACON TOLD ME WHAT YOU SAID,
SO I FAKED THE WHOLE THING.

17:41.142 --> 17:44.311
YOU FAKED IT?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

17:44.379 --> 17:46.714
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU THAT YOU
CAN'T BE HAPPY THAT I'M HAPPY.

17:46.781 --> 17:48.599
AND WHY CAN'T YOU
WANT MORE FOR YOURSELF?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.367
WHAT MORE COULD
I WANT, CARRIE?

17:50.434 --> 17:53.036
I HAVE A JOB THAT I LIKE. I'M IN
LOVE WITH A WOMAN THAT I'M MARRIED TO.

17:53.104 --> 17:54.537
OH, SHUT UP.

17:54.605 --> 17:56.957
I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT THIS
STUPID SNAKE ON MY ARM.

17:57.025 --> 17:59.225
EXCUSE ME.
THERE'S A GAP.

17:59.293 --> 18:02.479
YEAH. EXCUSE ME. WHO'S GONNA
FILL THE GAP IN MY LIFE, OK?

18:02.547 --> 18:05.399
STEP FORWARD, PLEASE.

18:05.466 --> 18:08.636
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST RIDE
THIS STUPID THING AND GET HOME.

18:10.705 --> 18:12.706
WHAT? LET'S GO.

18:14.025 --> 18:15.208
I CAN'T.

18:15.276 --> 18:17.310
OH, YOU CAN'T.
ANOTHER FAKE CRISIS?

18:17.378 --> 18:20.714
NO, IT'S NOT A FAKE CRIS-
I... I CAN'T DO IT.

18:20.782 --> 18:24.284
OK, DOUG, YOU LISTEN TO ME
AND LISTEN TO ME GOOD.

18:24.351 --> 18:26.253
I'VE GIVEN UP MY DREAMS
OF A BETTER LIFE

18:26.321 --> 18:30.591
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOUR ONLY DREAM
WAS TO RIDE THIS STUPID ROLLER COASTER.

18:30.658 --> 18:32.826
SO YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR BUTT IN THAT CAR

18:32.893 --> 18:34.994
BECAUSE I AM COMING OUT
OF HERE WITH SOMETHING.

18:46.324 --> 18:48.675
LET'S GO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:48.743 --> 18:51.911
YOU'RE DOING
THIS ALONE, BABE. GOOD LUCK.

19:05.660 --> 19:06.593
HELLO.

19:06.661 --> 19:08.161
HONEY, IN CASE
I DON'T MAKE IT,

19:08.229 --> 19:09.663
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW I HATE YOU.

19:10.632 --> 19:14.301
AAH!

19:22.811 --> 19:25.079
WAIT. STOP. THEY'RE
SELLING FUDGE OVER THERE.

19:25.146 --> 19:27.081
ARTHUR, YOU'VE ALREADY
HAD LIKE A POUND OF IT.

19:27.148 --> 19:29.149
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GIVE YOU
CHOCOLATE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:29.217 --> 19:32.586
UNLESS YOU WANNA WAIT 45
MINUTES TO RIDE THE BUMPER BOATS,

19:32.654 --> 19:34.588
I SUGGEST YOU
GIVE ME WHAT I WANT.

19:34.656 --> 19:37.324
NO, ARTHUR. I'VE ALREADY
SPENT $100 ON YOU.

19:37.391 --> 19:39.876
COST OF KEEPING A DISABLED
WAR VETERAN HAPPY, $100.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.696
GETTING YOUR SON TO THE FRONT
OF EVERY LINE, PRICELESS.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.248
NOW, FUDGE ME UP!

19:44.316 --> 19:46.817
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:46.884 --> 19:48.952
I'M THROUGH
DRIVING MISS DAISY.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.637
OH, REALLY?

19:50.705 --> 19:54.441
PERHAPS I SHOULD SHOW THAT
PARK EMPLOYEE OVER THERE...

19:54.509 --> 19:56.309
A MIRACLE?

19:56.377 --> 19:58.178
OHH.

19:58.245 --> 20:00.380
I'M CALLING
YOUR BLUFF, OLD MAN.

20:00.448 --> 20:01.531
I'LL DO IT.

20:01.599 --> 20:03.133
YOU GOT A GOOD
THING GOING HERE.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.069
ME WHEELING YOU AROUND,
EVERYONE FAWNING ALL OVER YOU.

20:06.137 --> 20:09.105
YOU'RE GONNA BLOW ALL THAT
FOR A LOUSY PIECE OF FUDGE?

20:12.227 --> 20:13.960
SHAME ON YOU!

20:16.831 --> 20:19.649
SO SHOULD WE HIT
WET AND WILD?

20:19.717 --> 20:21.985
GIVE ME THAT SOMBRERO.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.940
SO THE THING IS...

20:27.008 --> 20:28.976
I'M WORKING
IN THE SUBWAY NOW,

20:29.043 --> 20:31.712
BUT I'D REALLY LIKE
TO BE A WRITER.

20:31.779 --> 20:34.247
I THINK I HAVE A NOVEL IN ME.

20:34.315 --> 20:35.983
I... GOD.

20:36.050 --> 20:38.519
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST RAMBLING.

20:42.724 --> 20:44.424
GOD, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

20:46.961 --> 20:50.363
WOULD IT BE OK
IF... IF I KISSED YOU?

20:56.070 --> 20:57.638
NO, DON'T.

21:07.898 --> 21:10.683
SO, UH, WHAT TIME
DO YOU GET OFF?

21:10.751 --> 21:12.802
I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE
CAN GO HIT THE BEER GARDEN

21:12.870 --> 21:14.938
OVER THERE
IN FANTASY FOREST.

21:16.140 --> 21:18.208
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
