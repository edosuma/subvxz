01:15.834 --> 01:17.433
Come on, Al.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.966
Is that the best you can do?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.567
Peg, I can't concentrate

01:21.601 --> 01:24.800
if you're gonna keep
shouting instructions.

01:25.334 --> 01:28.433
Not like that, you moron.

01:28.467 --> 01:31.200
Who taught you
to do this, anyway?

01:31.234 --> 01:33.033
All right, that's it. I quit.

01:33.067 --> 01:34.934
Haven't we done enough
for one day?

01:34.968 --> 01:36.266
Oh, all right.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.533
At least ya did something.

01:44.067 --> 01:47.867
I'm sick of spending
my day-off scooping doodie.

01:47.901 --> 01:49.300
Damn dog.

01:49.334 --> 01:52.999
Why can't he use Marcie's yard
like everybody else?

01:53.033 --> 01:55.500
Well, here's another "why"
for you to ponder, honey.

01:55.534 --> 01:57.867
Why'd you bring
the doodie in the house?

01:59.901 --> 02:01.099
Heh-heh-heh.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.266
For the fun part, Peg.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.834
Watch this.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.567
Yow!

02:10.967 --> 02:12.967
Sorry, ma'am.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.967
I hit a power-walker, Peg.

02:20.167 --> 02:21.133
She's coming in.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.800
Oh, whoa!

02:26.067 --> 02:27.400
Come on, Bud.

02:27.434 --> 02:29.099
My assignment
for modeling school

02:29.133 --> 02:30.900
is to take a total wreck
of a human,

02:30.934 --> 02:32.433
a complete fashion frog,

02:32.467 --> 02:33.667
and do a makeover.

02:33.701 --> 02:35.533
Please, I need an absolute zero,

02:35.567 --> 02:39.034
and everyone says
that you'd be perfect.

02:40.934 --> 02:43.300
Now, I have carefully crafted
my look over the years

02:43.334 --> 02:47.368
into the finely-honed babe train
you see before you.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.468
To look at me,
is to love me.

02:56.868 --> 03:00.734
Sometimes love's
a hurtin' thing.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.133
I am not like
the other girls you know.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.333
I don't wanna change
your face or your body

03:05.367 --> 03:07.567
or your odious personality.

03:07.601 --> 03:09.533
Just give me a shot
at your clothes.

03:09.567 --> 03:13.734
And what is wrong
with my clothes, Kel?

03:18.667 --> 03:21.167
Nothing, Yoda.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.066
If you're referring
to the jacket,

03:29.100 --> 03:33.533
the salesgirl said Kevin Costner
swears by these jackets.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.333
And it is not a Yoda jacket.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.266
If it was, it wouldn't have been
up on the rack

03:37.300 --> 03:39.633
next to
the Dick Tracy raincoats.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.966
Oh, God.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.099
I'm dressed like
an action figure.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.233
Kel, help me. Shoot me.
Dress me.

03:48.267 --> 03:50.767
There, there, Ewok.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.433
Just trust me.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.667
When I'm through with you,

03:53.701 --> 03:55.433
the only laughter
that you're gonna hear

03:55.467 --> 03:58.633
is when you're
out of your clothes.

04:13.734 --> 04:16.834
Oh, Al.
Take me again.

04:16.868 --> 04:19.934
I didn't even know
I was taking you then.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.333
I tripped on a box,

04:21.367 --> 04:24.533
and then I thought
the furnace fell on me.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.500
Probably God,
personally delivering a plague.

04:33.601 --> 04:34.633
Excuse me.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.500
Is this magnificent
beast yours?

04:37.534 --> 04:39.500
Yes, but she's very expensive.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.066
Uh, no.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.433
No, I meant the dog.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.133
I don't know
that dog.
Not ours.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.099
We chased it
off the lawn.
Oh.

04:48.133 --> 04:49.834
If you could tell me
whom he belongs to,

04:49.868 --> 04:53.334
it might be worth $10,000
to the owner.

04:53.901 --> 04:55.366
Ah, look, Peg.

04:55.400 --> 04:59.099
That's our beloved
family pet.

04:59.133 --> 05:02.366
I'm interested in using
your dog as a stud.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.401
Well, let me--
Let me ask the dog.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.800
What do you say, boy?

05:08.834 --> 05:11.066
Well, he's not the most
attractive man in the world,

05:11.100 --> 05:12.700
but he's got a kind face.

05:12.734 --> 05:14.767
Don't you think you could
maybe do something-- ?

05:14.801 --> 05:18.066
It's not for me,
you nitwit.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.500
It's for my dog.

05:19.534 --> 05:22.333
Oh, uh...

05:22.367 --> 05:24.366
For your dog.
Yeah.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.900
Uh--

05:27.267 --> 05:29.733
Peg, why don't you go upstairs
and get Buck's jacket

05:29.767 --> 05:33.400
and his little collar, you know,
his-- His evening collar.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.500
Yeah, and maybe I better
throw in his muzzle.

05:36.534 --> 05:40.067
<i>We wouldn't want the other dog
to get his hand bit.</i>

05:42.501 --> 05:43.800
Perhaps I should explain.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.600
Uh, perhaps you should
do it from there.

05:47.801 --> 05:50.999
I am the proud owner
of grand champion

05:51.033 --> 05:53.467
Astoria's Lady of Marseilles.

05:53.501 --> 05:54.966
Winner of the best of breed,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.600
Edinburgh International
Dog Show.

05:57.634 --> 06:01.467
I believe she is
the best briard bitch

06:01.501 --> 06:03.834
on the circuit today.

06:03.868 --> 06:05.533
And I'd want to mate her
with your dog,

06:05.567 --> 06:07.600
whose fine bones
I couldn't help but notice

06:07.634 --> 06:12.133
as he, um, fell down
when he lifted his leg to pee.

06:12.167 --> 06:14.700
Well, that can happen
to a guy.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.500
Many's the time
my leg falls asleep,

06:16.534 --> 06:20.034
before you know it, whoop,
you're on your side.

06:20.601 --> 06:22.733
Spare us, Al.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.467
Relive some
old football memories

06:24.501 --> 06:25.700
in your head
or something.

06:25.734 --> 06:27.800
I'm gonna talk
to this man.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.633
So how do we get
that 10 thou?

06:29.667 --> 06:32.966
By breeding your champion
with mine.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.001
I'll fly her in
from Munich,

06:37.634 --> 06:39.934
and upon successful breeding,

06:39.968 --> 06:44.200
I will pay the stud fee
of $10,000.

06:44.234 --> 06:45.200
Here's my card.

06:45.234 --> 06:47.600
Call me to arrange a date.

06:47.634 --> 06:49.900
Oh, and by the way,

06:49.934 --> 06:53.500
my Astoria is
a very discerning dog.

06:53.534 --> 06:55.533
So, for God's sakes,

06:55.567 --> 06:59.600
please, brush
your dog's teeth.

07:01.601 --> 07:02.867
Oh!

07:02.901 --> 07:05.034
Did you hear that, Al?

07:08.901 --> 07:10.934
Wake up, Gipper.

07:10.968 --> 07:12.500
Look at him, Al.

07:12.534 --> 07:15.166
Our home finally has
a breadwinner.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.233
And he's a good boy too.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.600
He's a good little boy.
You're gonna get a lot of money.

07:19.634 --> 07:23.134
Yes, you are.
I was All City,
you know, boy.

07:23.634 --> 07:25.600
God, what is taking him
so long?

07:25.634 --> 07:26.633
Bud, come down here,

07:26.667 --> 07:28.934
the girls from my class
are waiting.

07:28.968 --> 07:30.934
I'm not ready.

07:30.968 --> 07:31.966
Relax, Kel.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.433
What do you care
about your grade?

07:33.467 --> 07:34.800
You're getting
a cut of $10,000

07:34.834 --> 07:35.867
from your dog anyway.

07:35.901 --> 07:37.033
Yeah, but I'm probably

07:37.067 --> 07:38.934
gonna have to put that away
for my old age.

07:38.968 --> 07:42.633
You know the big two-five
is not so far away.

07:44.033 --> 07:46.133
I'm ready.

07:46.167 --> 07:49.433
Okay. Now, we all remember what
Bud looked like before, right?

07:49.467 --> 07:51.834
Sick.
Ew.
Ew.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.700
Okay, yeah, well,
hold that thought

07:53.734 --> 07:56.600
while I introduce you
to the new Bud light.

07:56.634 --> 07:58.633
Budrick?

08:15.234 --> 08:17.233
What do you think, ladies?

08:17.267 --> 08:21.301
Early James Dean or
the bride of Leavenworth?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.300
Well, you'll notice
how the attention

08:24.334 --> 08:27.366
has been subtly diverted
from the danger area,

08:27.400 --> 08:28.999
his face,

08:29.033 --> 08:31.166
by the hat and
the plunging neckline.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.999
Which, if he had a chest,
would now be exposed.

08:35.033 --> 08:37.967
Kelly, you're gonna get
an A for sure.

08:38.567 --> 08:39.533
I'm gonna go change

08:39.567 --> 08:41.833
and hang myself
in the shower now.

08:41.868 --> 08:44.633
Oh, please, not yet.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.533
Wouldn't you like
to go to the movies

08:46.567 --> 08:49.333
or my dad's condo?

08:49.367 --> 08:51.633
Hey!

08:51.667 --> 08:53.099
I was gonna ask.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.333
I always liked him.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.667
Well, then wait till
I'm through with him.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.567
Thank you, ladies,

08:58.601 --> 09:00.366
but the entertainment
is over for the day.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.834
The clown must rest.

09:02.868 --> 09:05.300
I don't believe
any of you for a second.

09:05.334 --> 09:07.834
Well, would you
believe this?

09:10.734 --> 09:12.767
Well, how 'bout this?

09:14.934 --> 09:16.066
He's mine.
He's mine.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.934
I saw him first when
he came down the stairs.

09:17.968 --> 09:20.033
Please!
I'm better friends
with Kelly than you.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.834
He was looking at me.
He was looking at--

09:21.868 --> 09:24.066
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.400
Now, we're all adults here.

09:26.434 --> 09:28.099
There's plenty of room
on this body

09:28.133 --> 09:30.667
for all of your hands.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.133
Uh, Kel.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.300
Tell Mom I'll be home
in a couple of days

09:40.334 --> 09:41.533
and to buy some food,

09:41.567 --> 09:43.633
'cause I think
I'm gonna be hungry.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.567
Mother.

09:54.601 --> 09:56.334
Father.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.133
Hey, how did Buck do?

10:02.167 --> 10:05.333
Did he and the girl dog
consummate?

10:05.367 --> 10:06.800
Well, not exactly.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.133
Buck got this really confused
look on his face,

10:09.167 --> 10:11.533
like he had no idea
what to do.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.667
I know that look well.

10:15.167 --> 10:16.366
If I've seen it once,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.867
I've seen it once
every three months.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.966
Now, Peg, there's $10,000
at stake here.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.667
Not nearly enough
for what I'm about to do,

10:25.701 --> 10:26.966
but if you want
to get rich,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.366
sometimes you have
to get dirty.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.300
Peg, let's go upstairs.

10:31.334 --> 10:33.900
I want Buck to learn
from the best.

10:39.868 --> 10:40.834
Come on, Buck!

10:40.868 --> 10:43.368
Come on, boy!

11:03.367 --> 11:04.467
Come here, boy.

11:04.501 --> 11:05.667
Gee, Al.
Come here, boy.

11:05.701 --> 11:07.467
You were magnificent.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.333
Where does he get it from?

11:09.367 --> 11:11.200
You know, I don't think
I've ever seen a dog

11:11.234 --> 11:14.767
try to cover his eyes
with his paws before.

11:14.801 --> 11:16.767
Well, that's what
I don't understand, Peg.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.233
If he could
copy that from me,

11:18.267 --> 11:20.999
why couldn't he copy
the rest?

11:21.033 --> 11:23.667
Well, he does change
his underwear and socks

11:23.701 --> 11:25.368
as often as you do.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.999
She's just kidding, boy.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.334
She knows as well as we do
that the man is the king.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.800
What are you doing?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.633
We're trying to make him
wanna have sex.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.767
Isn't that
a good boy?

11:39.834 --> 11:41.433
The man is the king.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.966
He loves me
till I scream,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.167
"Oh, baby. Oh, baby.
Please stop."

11:52.000 --> 11:55.867
Hey, here's a proud beauty,
eh, boy?

11:56.234 --> 11:58.400
Legs that won't quit.

11:58.434 --> 12:01.700
Quite a saucy little lilt
to the tail.

12:01.734 --> 12:05.400
Look at that come-hither look
on her snout.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.099
Now, what I would do
if I were you,

12:07.133 --> 12:09.934
next time you hop
that briard,

12:09.968 --> 12:12.066
I'd just close my eyes

12:12.100 --> 12:15.600
and pretend I was
Bundyfying a poodle.

12:16.334 --> 12:18.500
Listen to him, Buck.

12:18.534 --> 12:20.567
He satisfied me.

12:20.601 --> 12:23.600
Look how happy I am.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.266
Gee, Al.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.233
Nice to see you
down on all fours,

12:29.267 --> 12:31.667
like your forefathers.

12:32.467 --> 12:35.200
Next, perhaps you could point
to a wheel and say,

12:35.234 --> 12:37.433
"Me no understand wheel thing.

12:37.467 --> 12:40.468
Wanna buy some shoes?"

12:42.133 --> 12:44.233
Well, it-- It looks
like something

12:44.267 --> 12:47.767
that come from the Colonel,
all right, but the, uh--

12:52.234 --> 12:54.400
But the, uh-- The legs
are picked clean,

12:54.434 --> 12:57.434
a- and I don't see
any breasts.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.099
That was a good one, eh, boy?

13:02.133 --> 13:03.667
Well, from where I stand,

13:03.701 --> 13:05.467
the brain has been picked clean,

13:05.501 --> 13:07.734
and I can't find any hair.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.400
So, what's he doing,

13:10.434 --> 13:13.266
regaling Buck with his
high school football stories?

13:13.300 --> 13:16.667
Ha! Buck's heard all
of those a thousand times.

13:17.634 --> 13:20.533
Don't you two people understand
that what this dog needs to see

13:20.567 --> 13:24.533
is a strong, undisputed
male role model.

13:28.334 --> 13:30.834
Ah, Gigi's home.

13:32.734 --> 13:34.066
Thank you, ladies,

13:34.100 --> 13:37.600
but I think I can make it
the rest of the way myself.

13:43.567 --> 13:44.800
Ah!

13:44.834 --> 13:47.133
To be young again.

13:47.167 --> 13:51.134
Buck, make sure no harm
comes to the ladies.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.166
Uh, son,

13:56.200 --> 13:58.934
those weregirls
you were with, right?

13:58.968 --> 14:01.967
They're women now.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.633
Now, look, son,
I didn't say anything

14:04.667 --> 14:05.800
when you were, you know,

14:05.834 --> 14:07.966
lilac-ing around the house
the other day, or--

14:08.000 --> 14:10.800
Or yesterday when you
were wearing that skirt.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.233
Kilt, Dad.

14:13.267 --> 14:15.633
Sure, son.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.467
But tell me something, Bud.

14:17.501 --> 14:20.767
Y- you will be playing
baseball again, won't you?

14:21.634 --> 14:22.934
Hey, Mom, Dad.

14:22.968 --> 14:24.834
Did Bud tell you yet?

14:24.868 --> 14:25.999
Well, not in so many words,

14:26.033 --> 14:28.867
but we're not blind.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.066
Not that.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.333
I got an A
for making him over.

14:34.367 --> 14:36.533
There was
some stiff competition too.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.033
This one girl
brought in a chimp

14:38.067 --> 14:41.533
who was wearing a baseball cap
and a pair of polka-dot speedos.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.867
But I got the A
because my teacher said

14:43.901 --> 14:47.301
that I had less raw material
to work with.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.567
Well, human-for-a-day,
the assignment's over.

14:50.601 --> 14:54.233
I gotta get these clothes
back to La Petite Poof.

14:54.267 --> 14:57.999
No way, meals-on-heels.

14:58.033 --> 14:59.767
I'm floatin' on
an ocean o' babes,

14:59.801 --> 15:02.467
and I needs my fishnets.

15:02.501 --> 15:06.567
Do you realize that it costs me
$25 a day to rent this stuff?

15:06.601 --> 15:09.800
Well, that's more
than it costs to rent you.

15:11.734 --> 15:12.834
Hi, Kelly.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.967
Hi, Kelly.

15:19.901 --> 15:21.600
Ah, come on--
Don't worry, Al.

15:21.634 --> 15:22.767
He's just rebelling.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.333
I did it myself
for a while.

15:24.367 --> 15:25.500
'Course, I just drank--

15:25.534 --> 15:27.500
Drank beer
and smoked cigarettes.

15:27.534 --> 15:31.366
But then I wasn't rebelling
against heterosexuality.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.800
You know,
speaking of which,

15:32.834 --> 15:34.800
I think you've got
a problem with your dog.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.966
Oh, we know
all about it.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.800
Neither he nor his master
can perform.

15:39.834 --> 15:42.366
Oh, well,
I can't speak for Al.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.700
The satisfied look
on Peggy's face does that.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.600
But your dog is
a veritable windmill

15:51.634 --> 15:53.934
out on my yard with every dog
in the neighborhood,

15:53.968 --> 15:56.067
even the Hendersons' lawn elf.

15:57.234 --> 15:59.066
He's out there every day.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.767
You see, Peg, that's
this trouble with the briard.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.966
He's exhausted!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.934
Well, I'll put a stop to this.

16:05.968 --> 16:09.201
Oh, gee. This should be
worth watching.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.099
'Cause I don't think it's wise

16:11.133 --> 16:14.033
for Al to try and break up
a tryst between Buck

16:14.067 --> 16:16.366
and what appears to be
a very large rottweiler

16:16.400 --> 16:18.368
with a spike collar.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.300
Hey! Hey, not there!

16:20.334 --> 16:22.600
Not th--
Hey, watch it now!

16:35.100 --> 16:37.300
Well, Buck's been locked
down in the basement

16:37.334 --> 16:39.900
for two weeks now.

16:39.934 --> 16:43.500
With absolutely no female
contact whatsoever.

16:43.534 --> 16:46.034
God, how I envy him.

16:46.968 --> 16:48.066
Watch this, Peg.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.101
Buck!

16:50.467 --> 16:52.834
Lady briard!

16:56.567 --> 16:58.401
Lassie!

17:02.300 --> 17:04.300
Nancy Reagan!

17:11.501 --> 17:15.001
See, that's why I never
believed that Sinatra story.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.098
Let's get him back
in the mood again.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.233
Buck!

17:20.267 --> 17:22.434
Mommy's shoes!

17:24.501 --> 17:26.633
I'd say he's ready.

17:26.666 --> 17:29.333
Honey, are you sure you should
be going out so soon?

17:29.367 --> 17:32.767
I mean, the lockjaw
just cleared up.

17:33.033 --> 17:33.999
Come on.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.266
Here he is, Peg.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.966
Looking unintelligent
as ever.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.934
<i>But I'll tell ya,
from the looks of my Playboys</i>

17:38.968 --> 17:40.333
he shredded down there,

17:40.367 --> 17:42.967
I'll say he's ready to rock
to the tune of 10 grand.

17:43.434 --> 17:45.333
Come on. There we go.
Come on.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.867
Well, Al, be careful.

17:46.901 --> 17:49.533
I heard that the McGintys'
poodle was in heat.

17:49.567 --> 17:50.733
Heel, boy!

17:50.767 --> 17:53.468
Heel! Heel! Oh, whoa, heel!

18:00.634 --> 18:01.600
Oh, and you know,

18:01.634 --> 18:04.266
so is the Ritter's Irish setter

18:04.300 --> 18:05.633
right across the street.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.934
You're killing me, boy!

18:06.968 --> 18:09.234
Killing me, boy!

18:11.100 --> 18:14.767
And also the Finleys' beagle
behind our house.

18:14.801 --> 18:16.767
Hey now, Buck! Hey now, Buck!

18:16.801 --> 18:18.800
Hey! Ah! Oh!

18:24.100 --> 18:25.567
Yep, I used to play hockey,

18:25.601 --> 18:26.733
and I was great.

18:26.767 --> 18:27.999
Then I said to myself,

18:28.033 --> 18:32.500
"Bud, you're an artist,
and very handsome.

18:32.534 --> 18:35.733
"Why would you let
your violent side take over?

18:35.767 --> 18:40.600
If you must swing a stick,
swing a stick for love."

18:41.400 --> 18:43.333
That's beautiful.

18:43.367 --> 18:45.767
Take me.

18:49.534 --> 18:53.567
Well, it's been
a while since, uh--

18:55.567 --> 18:57.133
Well, it's been a while

18:57.167 --> 18:59.066
since your daddy took
Buck to do the deed.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.300
That 10,000 bucks
should be on the way.

19:02.334 --> 19:03.567
Well, that's good,
Mom,

19:03.601 --> 19:05.966
'cause I'm running
low on lamè.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.500
Did they reinstitute
the draft or something?

19:11.801 --> 19:12.800
He's here!

19:12.834 --> 19:14.033
We're rich!
Yes!

19:14.067 --> 19:16.467
Oh, Al, gimme
that check.

19:16.501 --> 19:19.500
Honey, this isn't
a check for $10,000.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.400
This is a bill
for $10,000.

19:22.434 --> 19:23.600
If you look closer,

19:23.634 --> 19:26.800
you'll see it's a bill
for $100,000.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.834
See, Buck was ready,
all right.

19:32.634 --> 19:36.033
A little bit more ready
than our Lady of Astoria.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.834
Or should I say,

19:37.868 --> 19:40.867
the late Lady of Astoria?

19:41.868 --> 19:44.368
To death, Al?

19:47.701 --> 19:50.201
And beyond, Peg.

19:51.601 --> 19:52.834
But don't worry,

19:52.868 --> 19:56.033
the hundred thou is payable
over a three-day period.

19:56.067 --> 19:57.166
So I figure, you know,

19:57.200 --> 19:58.966
a couple of busy days
at the shoe store,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.301
maybe a lemonade stand manned
by my two daughters, here...

20:04.868 --> 20:06.533
...we'll be able to save up
enough money

20:06.567 --> 20:08.633
to buy a chocolate bar
and maybe some nylons

20:08.667 --> 20:11.600
for my new cellmate, Bruno.

20:12.534 --> 20:13.600
Daddy?

20:13.634 --> 20:15.133
If it'll help any,

20:15.167 --> 20:20.067
you can have my share
of the $10,000.

20:21.467 --> 20:25.468
I'll miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.500
Uh, excuse me.

20:27.534 --> 20:30.700
So you're not getting
a cut of $10,000?

20:30.734 --> 20:32.200
Well, no, but...

20:32.234 --> 20:36.067
what difference does that make
when we have what we have?

20:37.601 --> 20:39.500
Have that.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.066
Fine!

20:41.100 --> 20:44.001
There's plenty more
where you came from, babe.

20:45.234 --> 20:47.733
I gotta see this.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.133
He didn't get the money.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.567
Let's burn him!

20:50.601 --> 20:52.500
Yeah!
Whoo!

20:52.534 --> 20:54.300
Not there! Not there!

20:54.334 --> 20:56.401
Kill him!
Watch it now!

20:58.701 --> 21:01.300
Aw, honey, don't be sad.

21:01.334 --> 21:02.934
The worst thing that happened

21:02.968 --> 21:04.767
is that we owe
another hundred grand.

21:04.801 --> 21:06.066
I mean, what are they
gonna do?

21:06.100 --> 21:07.900
Garnish your paycheck?

21:11.934 --> 21:13.600
Yeah. Or yours.

21:15.968 --> 21:18.934
You know, go into
the kids' college funds.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.600
Or our retirement fund.

21:22.634 --> 21:24.633
We don't have any!

21:26.601 --> 21:28.767
Or our life insurance.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.667
We have nothing!

21:37.801 --> 21:41.633
Ah, you really know how
to make me feel better, Peg.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.834
And you know what you could do
to make me feel better.

21:45.868 --> 21:47.834
Way ahead of you, babe.

22:13.634 --> 22:15.700
Hey, how 'bout that one?

22:15.734 --> 22:17.800
You're the king, baby.

22:17.834 --> 22:20.334
You got that right.
