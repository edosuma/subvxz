IT SEEMS YOU PUT OFF
LEARNING YOUR DANCE.

22:35.353 --> 22:38.607
OF COURSE I PUT OFF
LEARNING MY DANCE.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.109
WHAT SICK COUNTRY
MAKES SHOES OUT OF WOOD?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.527
WHY COULDN'T THE DUTCH
MAKE SHOES

22:42.611 --> 22:43.320
OUT OF SOMETHING
MORE COMFORTABLE

22:43.403 --> 22:46.031
LIKE BROKEN GLASS
OR RUSTY NAILS?

22:46.114 --> 22:47.741
{\an1}WELL, NOW, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
JENNIFER.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.285

22:50.368 --> 22:52.079

22:52.162 --> 22:57.000
{\an1}BUT NEXT TIME,
DON'T PROCRASTINATE.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.544
{\an5}SORRY, MR. WRIGHT.
I THINK I LEARNED
MY LESSON.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.679
AND NOW IT IS TIME
FOR YOU TO ACCEPT...

23:09.763 --> 23:11.515
DA FEET.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.561
[LAUGHTER]

23:18.188 --> 23:23.193
YODELAY, YODELAY,
YODELAY...

23:23.276 --> 23:24.569
{\an1}CAN I GET A COPY
OF THAT?

23:24.653 --> 23:26.154
OH, YEAH.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.323
{\an5}SHE'S A PRETTY GOOD DANCER
WHEN SHE'S NOT WEARING
WOODEN SHOES.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.075
YODELAY, YODELAY,
YODELAY...
