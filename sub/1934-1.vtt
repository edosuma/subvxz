WEBVTT

01:12.072 --> 01:13.281
Dre, you ready?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.991
- Yeah, one second.
- Almost forgot.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.619
Dre, I am so excited.

01:19.538 --> 01:23.249
It's like we're brave pioneers on a quest

01:23.333 --> 01:26.878
to start a new life in a magical new land.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.130
You could say that.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.764
Okay. All right, let's go.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.353
And don't forget to use the bathroom.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.480
Okay.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.610
I know, I know, I know, I know.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.028
Okay, okay.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.155
I just got my hair done.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.285
Okay, be very careful with that. Okay.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.665
- I'll see you later, Uncle Charlie.
- I love you.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.793
Come on, Dre, we can't miss this plane!

02:06.877 --> 02:09.336
Bye. See you later, Dre.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.839
Bye, guys. We're gonna miss you.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.095
Naw, man, it's yours.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.556
Come on, Dre, just take it.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.937
Thanks, man.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.526
Okay, Dre, come on, we have to go.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.821
Okay, bye, guys!
We'll call as soon as we land!

03:31.962 --> 03:34.088
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to flight...</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:36.382
- You got it?
- Yeah.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.717
<i>... with service to Beijing.</i>

03:37.801 --> 03:40.595
Dre, look. We're already on lesson 10.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.432
How are you?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.896
Remember what that one is?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.063
No.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.983
Dre, you're killing me.

03:54.276 --> 04:01.157
Mom, look, in China, everything is old.
There's old houses, old parks, old people.

04:01.491 --> 04:05.202
Look. This guy is at least 400 years old.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.997
Dre, please focus, okay?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.877
What's your name?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.005
You need to practice.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.548
- Yeah, you need to try it.
- No, Mom.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.675
- Yes, Dre. Dre.
- Mom.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.887
Ask him. Go ahead.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.349
Ask him, "What's your name?"
And "How are you?"

04:26.433 --> 04:27.808
Do it now.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.824
Dude, I'm from Detroit.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.040
What's up?

05:04.137 --> 05:07.556
<i>Our flight time will be 13 hours</i>
<i>and 30 minutes.</i>

05:07.641 --> 05:10.726
<i>We will be serving dinner and breakfast.</i>

06:02.154 --> 06:04.697
She said to meet her at number five.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.949
What is that?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.451
Mrs. Packer?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.162
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.039
It's "Parker."

06:13.123 --> 06:16.375
Apologies, Mrs. Parker. Welcome to Beijing.

06:35.270 --> 06:38.814
And this is your electricity card. Same thing.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.566
You think you might have one in English?

06:40.650 --> 06:44.445
Look! There's Olympic Village!
Isn't it beautiful?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.781
Yes.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.992
I guess there's
nothing old in China, huh, Dre?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.015
Look at that, Dre. Beverly Hills.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.726
We always talked about living there, huh?

07:15.811 --> 07:18.562
But I think we were talking about
the other one, Mom.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.648
I got a good feeling about this.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.324
Oh, yeah.
You must be the new dude in 305. I'm Harry.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.951
Hey. What's up? I'm Dre.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.453
- Here, let me help you.
- Thanks, man.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.582
So how come you guys
are moving to China?

07:38.667 --> 07:40.543
My mom got transferred.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.710
Passport, please. Thank you.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.879
- She works at the car factory.
- Okay.

07:44.631 --> 07:50.511
Can you please explain this electricity card?
Because we don't have these in America.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.017
Know any Chinese?

07:57.894 --> 07:58.936
Nah.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.397
This is China. Might not be a bad idea.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.610
That's our park. You should come.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.364
Look at you, making friends already.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.742
- Hi, I'm Dre's mother.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.703
Nice to meet you, too.
You can call me Miss Sherry.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.746
- I'm Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.833
So I guess I'll see you later, then?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.294
- Maybe.
- Okay, cool. See ya.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.515
Okay, this is your rental agreement
in English.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.519
So the landlady is Mrs. Wang.
Her English is not good.

08:40.604 --> 08:45.191
But if something goes wrong,
you go to Mr. Han. His English is very good.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.442
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.903
- So welcome to Beijing, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.906
- So I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, sure. Thank you!

08:51.990 --> 08:53.324
Wait, wait.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.410
You mentioned something
about going to the police...

09:08.506 --> 09:10.007
Wow, this is perfect, Dre.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.302
Everything we need is in walking distance.
You know what?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.472
We could have lunch together every day
at your school if you wanted to.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.557
Negative. Not a chance.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.649
Dre, we are not doing this in Beijing.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.276
Dre, pick up yourjacket.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.697
Mom, I'm tired, okay? I have airplane lag.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.079
"Airplane."

09:43.208 --> 09:44.792
It's jet lag.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.504
I know, baby, I got it, too.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.133
But we can't go to sleep.

09:53.218 --> 09:57.221
'Cause then we'll be up at 2:00 a.m.
And you have school tomorrow.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.150
Dre! Can you please
go find the maintenance man?

10:10.235 --> 10:11.485
I need to take a shower

10:11.569 --> 10:13.445
- and the hot water's broken!
- Yeah!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.324
Excuse me.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.076
I'm looking for the maintenance man.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.870
Mr. Han?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.250
Thanks.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.346
Mr. Han?

10:45.562 --> 10:46.687
Hi.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.029
We just moved into 305.
Hot water's not working.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.828
No hot agua.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.212
Looking for Mr. Han.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.590
Han?

11:20.597 --> 11:21.847
Mr. Han?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.103
Mr. Han?

11:29.522 --> 11:33.025
Me and my mom, we just moved in. 305.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.277
The hot water's not working.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.615
Mr. Han?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.871
Okay.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.249
Or I could just come back another time.

11:49.959 --> 11:54.421
Or you could just show me how to do it
so I could get outta your hair.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.785
That's nasty.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.414
I'm gonna go throw up.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.792
In 305, where the hot water's not working.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.503
I think he's busy.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.711
Hey, man, you made it. Welcome.

13:15.837 --> 13:16.879
Thanks.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.881
- You play, right?
- Yeah.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.215
Come on.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.388
- Okay, it's us three against them four.
- All right.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.848
All right.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.983
Good job, good job.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.735
Pass!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.202
Sub! Sub!

13:49.037 --> 13:52.080
My shooting hand has got some jet lag,

13:52.207 --> 13:54.082
so I'm gonna just...

14:10.183 --> 14:11.266
You want this?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.019
You want me to play?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.772
You know I have no problem
beating old people.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.445
Back where I come from,
they call me Ping Pong Dre, all right?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.906
I'm gonna take it easy on you.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.895
Come on, man. I'm 12.

15:06.656 --> 15:10.409
He's really good.
I've never seen him lose to anybody.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.660
Yeah.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.165
Dude. Are you gonna talk to her or what?

15:17.292 --> 15:19.001
- To who?
- To her.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.754
- The girl you've been staring at.
- I wasn't staring at her, dude.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.506
Yeah, you were.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.844
You should go talk to her.
Unless you're scared.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.762
I'm not scared of anything.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.973
Then do it. Go. Come on.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.519
Cool. Right now.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.527
Hey.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.947
What's up?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.452
I forgot, no English.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.837
What language was that?

16:05.048 --> 16:06.214
You speak English?

16:07.342 --> 16:08.550
Me, too.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.553
So, what are you listening to?

16:12.722 --> 16:13.889
Bach.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.225
Bach. I listen to them all the time.
They're tight.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.644
Wait, you ever heard of this?

16:25.568 --> 16:28.236
Oh, yeah, you like that, huh? Wait.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.710
Wait, whoa. It's going over here.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.673
It's going below. Wait, wait.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.258
- It's coming back.
- May I touch your hair?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.680
You wanna touch my hair?

16:57.767 --> 16:58.767
Sure.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.531
You should be practicing.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.700
I am practicing.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.285
What you're doing you won't need these.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.453
What's your problem?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.621
Leave it.

17:26.963 --> 17:27.963
Come on, dude!

17:32.135 --> 17:33.802
I said leave it!

18:04.667 --> 18:05.709
Go get him.

18:05.835 --> 18:06.918
Go get him.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.295
Go, go, go!

18:13.342 --> 18:14.676
Yeah!

18:52.882 --> 18:54.216
Still want to fight?

19:25.581 --> 19:29.793
- Are you okay? Let me help.
- Just leave me alone. I'm fine.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.799
- Dre.
- Dude, leave me alone.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.813
Dre, are you ready?

20:31.939 --> 20:33.648
'Cause we gotta be there in like 20 minutes.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.400
I know, Mom.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.152
And you have your uniform on, right?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.320
Yes, Mom.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.488
Don't wanna break any rules on the first day.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.535
Okay. Come on. Waiting for you.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.130
You know, you don't have to come in.
I mean, I can handle it.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.841
Dre, don't be silly. It's your first day.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.261
Plus, we both have to meet
the assistant principal, Mrs. Po.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.181
I can find her.
And you need to get to work, right?

21:06.307 --> 21:09.184
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, Mom.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.686
Mrs. Po?

21:12.188 --> 21:13.480
Hi, Mrs. Po.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.482
Ms. Parker. We've been waiting.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.735
I am so sorry we're late.
We just flew in from Detroit last night.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.236
This is my son, Dre.

21:20.363 --> 21:21.488
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.658
We only wear uniforms on Uniform Day.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.409
That's my fault.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.413
I didn't have a chance
to read the school packet you sent me.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.082
We'll be better tomorrow. Yeah.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.709
And hats are not permitted.

21:35.086 --> 21:38.171
Yeah, I should have read up
on the dress code.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.006
Dre, is that makeup?

21:40.341 --> 21:41.549
What is that?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.426
Mom, I ran into a pole.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.429
No, you have a black eye.
You got into a fight?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.640
Fighting's not tolerated here.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.559
You heard him, he ran into a pole.
Come here, Dre.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.269
- Mom, don't start.
- Who did it?

21:53.396 --> 21:54.938
Nobody, Mom. I ran into a pole.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.940
And I didn't tell you 'cause I knew
you would act like this.

21:57.066 --> 22:00.026
Dre, you know I don't play that.
Somebody hit my baby, I will tear through...

22:00.111 --> 22:02.904
I know, Mom.
That's why I don't tell you stuff.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.741
- Just relax. I just ran into a pole.
- Yeah, yeah, you ran into a pole.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.540
All right, Dre. All right, all right.
Look, go to class.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.418
Go to class, but we will talk about this later.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.961
- Okay? All right. Go.
- Okay.

22:20.923 --> 22:21.965
I love you.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.634
Mom!

22:26.095 --> 22:27.262
I said I love you.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.723
Okay, I love you, too.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.766
Okay, have a good day.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.910
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.922
You know, we only wear our uniforms
on Uniform Day.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.176
Oh, yeah. I so got that one.

23:11.474 --> 23:12.807
Thanks.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.143
I'm Mei Ying.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.187
I'm Dre.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.112
Sorry about Cheng.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.200
So that's his name.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.202
Is he your boyfriend?

23:32.870 --> 23:33.995
No.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.664
Our parents are very close.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.333
Well, he definitely likes you.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.211
I have to go practice.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.505
Wait.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.924
You eat and practice at the same time?

23:46.008 --> 23:47.050
Yes.

23:47.885 --> 23:52.222
But my mom says if you eat standing up,
it gives you gas.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.849
You're funny.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.694
Sorry.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.405
- Come on, dude!
- Mr. Parker! Stop it!

24:09.532 --> 24:11.533
He just slammed the tray all over me!

24:13.160 --> 24:14.661
Whatever he's saying, he is lying!

24:15.246 --> 24:17.372
Mr. Parker, go.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.834
Mr. Cheng, go.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.713
I hate this place!

25:12.928 --> 25:14.596
<i>Four. Five.</i>

25:15.264 --> 25:16.264
<i>Six.</i>

25:16.807 --> 25:18.016
<i>Seven.</i>

25:18.184 --> 25:19.434
<i>Eight.</i>

25:19.602 --> 25:21.186
<i>Nine. Ten.</i>

25:21.312 --> 25:22.604
Come to fix hot water.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.189
It's in there.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.299
Kid.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.134
Kid.

26:09.652 --> 26:13.696
Did you just hit me in my neck
with a toothpaste cap?

26:14.365 --> 26:15.782
Hot water fine.

26:15.866 --> 26:16.908
Flip switch.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.702
Wait half hour. Take shower.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.537
Flip switch off.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.373
Why don't you just leave it on?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.877
- You leave on in America?
- We don't have a switch in America.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.546
Get switch. Save planet.

26:32.675 --> 26:33.841
What happened to eye?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.427
I ran into a pole.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.055
Interesting pole.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.268
- Dre? I'm back.
- That's my mom.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.687
And the door handle's messed up.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.231
- Are you ready for school?
- Yeah!

26:50.859 --> 26:52.277
Hey, let me help you.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.029
They have your favorite cereal here.
I found it.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.288
Dre.

27:03.622 --> 27:08.584
For the one hundredth time,
can you please pick up yourjacket?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.920
- One second, Mom.
- No!

27:11.046 --> 27:13.047
Not in one second. Now.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.215
This program's about to be over.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.758
- Give me two minutes.
- Dre, I don't care!

27:16.218 --> 27:17.802
Come pick it up now!

27:17.886 --> 27:19.846
God, how many times do I have to ask you?

27:19.930 --> 27:21.014
Once.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.725
- That's right, make it happen.
- What's it with you and this jacket?

27:23.809 --> 27:25.393
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Nothing.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.312
Okay, just what I thought. Nothing.

27:29.565 --> 27:30.898
Thank you.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.813
No.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.648
From the top again.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.092
Okay. That's enough, please.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.803
You're rushing it.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.556
You must play the pauses.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.435
Do you know how important this is
for your family?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.395
What it'll mean for your life?

29:32.521 --> 29:34.230
We have to work this weekend.

29:34.356 --> 29:35.857
I'm calling your father.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.196
Well, continue.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.375
How'd that sound?

29:54.710 --> 29:56.627
Almost like Chinese.

29:56.712 --> 29:57.795
Yeah, I'm fluent.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.881
And I don't know
what that guy was talking about.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.591
I thought you sounded great.

30:01.717 --> 30:02.717
Thank you.

30:11.894 --> 30:16.481
So are you practicing for anything?
Like a show or...

30:16.565 --> 30:21.903
Yes. I have an audition next month
for the Beijing Academy of Music.

30:21.987 --> 30:26.073
Beijing Academy of Music.
Sounds important.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.159
You know,

30:29.411 --> 30:31.579
their initials spell "BAM."

30:35.792 --> 30:36.918
What?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.670
Yeah. Yeah.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.923
Gotta go.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.153
Hey.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.781
Can I touch your hair?

31:13.163 --> 31:14.497
Gonna do something?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.680
Just stay away from us.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.850
All of us.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.666
Baby.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.546
Dre, are you asleep?

32:34.828 --> 32:36.287
Hey, can you sign this?

32:36.622 --> 32:39.332
You're going to the Forbidden City?

32:39.416 --> 32:43.961
I think it's funny that you have to get
my permission to go to the Forbidden City.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.838
I got pull in Beijing.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.298
That's not funny, Mom.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.342
Cut it out, grumpy.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.594
I'm serious, Dre, this ice cream,

32:51.678 --> 32:54.555
I don't know what they do to it,
but it's more flavor-istic.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.723
What?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.391
Mom, this is you.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.894
"Oh, my goodness,
this ice cream here is so good,

32:59.978 --> 33:03.230
"and everything in China is
so much better than everything else..."

33:03.315 --> 33:04.940
Mom, come on!

33:05.025 --> 33:09.362
First of all, I don't sound like that,
and I don't move all like that.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.906
We should've got you some ice cream,
it's really good.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.075
- Mom, Mom, come on.
- Dre.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.701
- Mom, come on!
- Wait!

33:15.786 --> 33:17.453
Wait for me, Dre. Wait.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.705
Mom, come on.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.791
- Dre, wait!
- Stop!

33:21.875 --> 33:23.793
- Wait, wait!
- Mom!

33:25.253 --> 33:28.381
Boy, you gonna get a nut
for running from me.

33:29.758 --> 33:30.925
Wow.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.594
Kung fu.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.389
What do you learn here?

34:19.474 --> 34:23.351
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

34:24.688 --> 34:26.230
What do you learn here?

34:26.313 --> 34:30.359
No Weakness! No Pain! No Mercy!

34:31.235 --> 34:32.277
Begin!

34:45.958 --> 34:47.293
Hi, precious.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.463
- Mom. Mom, come on, let's go.
- What? What? Dre, we just got here.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.089
Come on, Mom.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.676
Dre, what's going on?

34:55.761 --> 34:57.011
Nothing.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.597
Dre, what happened? What happened?

34:59.681 --> 35:00.723
Nothing.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.600
Something happened.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.019
What, you don't like that karate class, baby?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.979
It's not karate, Mom.

35:08.815 --> 35:12.818
Okay, all right. Karate, kung fu, whatever.
Dre, what happened?

35:13.737 --> 35:15.529
We moved to China!

35:16.448 --> 35:17.990
That's what happened!

35:31.171 --> 35:32.630
Okay, stop.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.594
Don't be like that, Dre.

35:40.514 --> 35:44.016
What do you want me to do?
We've been here less than a week

35:44.100 --> 35:46.685
- and I feel...
- I feel like it's a year!

35:46.770 --> 35:48.020
I hate it here!

35:53.902 --> 35:56.153
Dre, please let me help you.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.826
I can't help you if you don't tell me
what's wrong, so please...

36:01.910 --> 36:03.786
You don't care what's wrong!

36:03.870 --> 36:08.874
All you care about is "how happy I am"
and "how great the ice cream is"!

36:08.959 --> 36:10.709
Well, I'm not happy!

36:10.794 --> 36:12.837
I hate it here!

36:22.389 --> 36:24.265
I wanna go home!

36:25.559 --> 36:28.561
Dre, we can't go home. Okay?

36:28.645 --> 36:31.438
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.149
This is what we got.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.445
This is home.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.700
Okay?

37:03.555 --> 37:06.056
<i>Hi, guys. Gather around here.</i>

37:06.308 --> 37:09.476
<i>As the emperor was considered to be divine,</i>

37:09.561 --> 37:12.229
<i>no mere mortal was permitted access.</i>

37:12.314 --> 37:13.856
<i>Hence the name</i>

37:13.940 --> 37:15.691
<i>the Forbidden City.</i>

37:54.773 --> 37:57.024
You touch them for good luck.

38:15.919 --> 38:19.046
- I wish someone would just...
- Yeah, me too.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.051
- Just tell someone.
- Yeah, I got it.

38:25.428 --> 38:26.887
Thanks a lot.

38:36.398 --> 38:41.235
<i>The floors of the palace were reinforced</i>
<i>with brick 15 layers deep</i>

38:41.319 --> 38:44.154
<i>to prevent anyone from tunneling in.</i>

38:44.239 --> 38:47.449
<i>Even if an outsider managed to get in...</i>

38:48.660 --> 38:50.285
- Mr. Parker?
- Yes?

38:50.495 --> 38:51.996
Is everything okay?

38:55.208 --> 38:56.750
Yes, thank you.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.290
You're fast.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.503
Not fast enough.

43:57.552 --> 43:59.219
He's had enough.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.888
Don't you remember what we learned?

44:02.890 --> 44:04.808
No weakness! No pain!

44:05.643 --> 44:06.727
No mercy!

44:06.853 --> 44:08.228
Cheng, stop!

44:26.748 --> 44:27.873
Go home.

46:32.832 --> 46:34.207
Come on.

46:48.264 --> 46:51.224
What's up with the light bulbs, Mr. Han?

47:28.930 --> 47:31.348
I thought you were just a maintenance man.

47:31.432 --> 47:35.101
You think only with your eyes,
so you are easy to fool.

47:38.147 --> 47:39.314
It doesn't hurt.

47:41.234 --> 47:43.151
Ancient Chinese healing.

47:44.237 --> 47:45.654
How'd you do that out there?

47:45.780 --> 47:48.823
You, like, didn't even punch them.
They beat each other up.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.576
When fighting angry, blind men,

47:52.328 --> 47:54.287
best to just stay out of the way.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.251
So where'd you learn kung fu?

47:59.335 --> 48:00.835
From father.

48:00.962 --> 48:02.462
Have you ever taught anybody?

48:04.298 --> 48:05.423
No.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.176
Would you?

48:09.971 --> 48:11.972
- Depends.
- On what?

48:12.807 --> 48:14.015
Reason.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.309
What about to kick somebody's ass?

48:19.939 --> 48:22.816
Best fights are the ones we avoid.

48:23.025 --> 48:25.485
What if I wanna avoid
getting my ass kicked?

48:25.611 --> 48:26.820
Stop saying "ass."

48:26.946 --> 48:27.988
Sorry.

48:33.661 --> 48:39.666
Kung fu is for knowledge, defense.
Not to make war, but create peace.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.501
That's definitely not what they're taught.

48:42.962 --> 48:46.256
No such thing as bad students,
only bad teacher.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.966
Oh, that's great.

48:48.050 --> 48:52.429
Well, I guess we'll just stroll in their school
and talk to their teacher.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.681
- Good idea.
- No, bad idea.

48:55.224 --> 48:56.891
If I go in there, I'll get my ass kick...

49:00.187 --> 49:01.646
I'll get beat up.

49:02.023 --> 49:03.732
You'll get beat up anyway.

49:08.696 --> 49:09.821
Will you go with me?

49:12.199 --> 49:13.658
No, sorry.

49:15.202 --> 49:16.870
But you said it was a good idea.

49:16.996 --> 49:18.663
For you. Bad idea for me.

49:18.748 --> 49:23.585
Come on, it's not like you're super busy
or anything, and I don't even speak Chinese.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.045
Very sorry.

49:30.718 --> 49:31.885
Okay.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.055
All right, whatever.

49:51.072 --> 49:52.113
Wait.

50:32.947 --> 50:34.114
What are you doing?

50:34.615 --> 50:35.824
Why did you stop?

50:37.284 --> 50:38.326
Finish!

50:43.999 --> 50:45.041
Come here!

51:02.309 --> 51:04.394
Okay, Mr. Han, let's get outta here.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.404
We do not stop when our enemy is down.

51:15.156 --> 51:16.489
No mercy...

51:18.033 --> 51:19.743
No mercy in the studio...

51:19.827 --> 51:21.119
No mercy in competition...

51:21.203 --> 51:22.996
No mercy in life!

51:25.499 --> 51:27.500
Our enemies deserve pain.

51:33.841 --> 51:35.049
What are you looking at?

51:36.218 --> 51:37.677
He's the one that attacked me.

51:51.859 --> 51:53.526
We are here to make peace.

51:55.446 --> 51:58.031
Let your little thing mind himself.

52:00.367 --> 52:02.035
One to one, no problem...

52:02.119 --> 52:05.705
...six to one, too much to ask of anyone.

52:06.540 --> 52:07.707
I see...

52:08.542 --> 52:10.210
Prepare for match.

52:13.756 --> 52:16.382
Whoa. Mr. Han, does he want us to fight?

52:19.136 --> 52:21.387
We are not here to fight.

52:26.227 --> 52:30.355
You attack my students
and disrespect my studio?!

52:30.439 --> 52:32.398
You want to leave? Not so easy!

52:35.236 --> 52:36.569
Master Li...

52:40.908 --> 52:42.909
You both came here.

52:44.119 --> 52:47.747
One of you fights now.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.296
The boy will fight there.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.771
We accept your challenge.

53:13.524 --> 53:18.319
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

53:20.030 --> 53:21.155
Attention!

53:24.660 --> 53:26.995
From now on, this little thing
is to be left alone...

53:27.663 --> 53:29.539
...until the tournament.

53:29.623 --> 53:30.874
Understood?

53:38.465 --> 53:41.467
If he does not show up for the competition...

53:42.136 --> 53:46.639
...I will bring pain to him and to you.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.153
So, that go pretty much how you planned it?

54:01.488 --> 54:03.281
There's good news and bad news.

54:03.365 --> 54:05.408
Good news is
they promise to leave you alone.

54:06.702 --> 54:07.785
Really?

54:08.078 --> 54:09.662
While you prepare.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.832
Prepare for what?

54:13.417 --> 54:14.459
Tournament.

54:14.919 --> 54:17.211
You'll fight them all one-on-one.

54:22.426 --> 54:25.553
So the bad news is
now they get to beat me up in public.

54:25.638 --> 54:26.721
Yes.

54:26.805 --> 54:29.140
Great. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.517
They're gonna kill me.
You saw their kung fu.

54:32.144 --> 54:33.770
That's not kung fu.

54:33.854 --> 54:35.897
That's a bad man
teach them very bad things.

54:35.981 --> 54:39.943
Well, that bad man
teaching very bad things hurt. A lot.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.739
More good news.

54:44.823 --> 54:47.158
I will teach you real kung fu.

54:50.621 --> 54:51.663
Yes!

55:01.757 --> 55:03.341
See you later, Mom.

55:03.425 --> 55:06.427
Hey, wait.
This is early for you for a Saturday.

55:06.512 --> 55:09.180
- Mr. Han's teaching me kung fu.
- The maintenance man?

55:09.264 --> 55:11.265
It's China, Mom. Everybody knows kung fu.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.143
Dre, you know how I feel about you fighting.

55:14.228 --> 55:17.480
Kung fu's not about fighting, Mom.
It's about making peace with your enemies.

55:17.564 --> 55:19.732
- Be careful, Dre.
- Okay.

56:00.024 --> 56:01.524
Mr. Han?

56:23.172 --> 56:24.255
Mr. Han?

56:24.923 --> 56:26.299
Back here.

56:28.510 --> 56:30.261
You know, you have a car
in your living room, Mr. Han.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.559
Okay, I was thinking about yesterday.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.437
I know that I was kind of freaking out
about the tournament,

56:39.521 --> 56:42.190
but I realized something last night.

56:42.274 --> 56:43.858
I'm an athlete.

56:44.818 --> 56:50.531
My number one asset is I'm fast, okay?
I'm quick, all right? I'm quick. Got speed.

56:50.616 --> 56:51.991
Cat speed.

56:53.410 --> 56:54.744
See? I'm quick, yeah?

56:54.828 --> 56:56.913
See, and I used to take gymnastics at PAL.

56:56.997 --> 56:58.831
That's the Police Athletic League,
so check it, right?

57:00.084 --> 57:01.793
Boom! You see that?

57:01.877 --> 57:04.462
Boom! You see that? Yeah.

57:05.214 --> 57:08.257
See, my Uncle Remy used to date
this Brazilian girl.

57:08.342 --> 57:11.177
And he learned jiu jitsu,
and he taught some of it to me.

57:11.261 --> 57:14.138
And it's like locks and holds and stuff.
So, okay, attack me.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.060
Right here.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.647
See that? Feel that?

57:22.731 --> 57:24.941
I could break it. I'm choosing not to.

57:25.025 --> 57:26.859
It's a pressure lock. Dangerous.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.195
And he also taught me capoeira, so...

57:30.030 --> 57:31.906
You can't touch me, you can't...

57:37.496 --> 57:39.247
That antique?

57:40.666 --> 57:42.083
Pick up yourjacket.

57:46.171 --> 57:49.006
So, basically, Mr. Han,
what I'm trying to say is

57:49.091 --> 57:53.344
I've got a good foundation here.
You know, like I said, I'm just...

57:53.428 --> 57:55.888
Might not be as hard to teach me
as other people, you know?

57:55.973 --> 57:57.014
Hang it up.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.392
Okay.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.227
All right, but now...

58:01.311 --> 58:02.603
Take it down.

58:05.899 --> 58:06.941
But you just...

58:07.276 --> 58:08.526
Take it down.

58:12.531 --> 58:13.739
Put it on.

58:19.413 --> 58:20.454
Take it off.

58:21.665 --> 58:24.083
- I already did all this.
- Take it off.

58:24.168 --> 58:26.502
- Can you just tell me why I'm doing this?
- Take it off.

58:30.799 --> 58:31.966
Hang it up.

58:36.763 --> 58:37.847
Take it down.

58:39.016 --> 58:40.099
Put it on the ground.

58:42.769 --> 58:43.853
Pick it up.

58:46.398 --> 58:47.690
Hang up.

58:48.901 --> 58:50.443
Take it down.

58:53.614 --> 58:54.989
Put it on.

58:56.033 --> 58:57.533
Take it off.

58:59.286 --> 59:00.411
Put it on the ground.

59:01.914 --> 59:03.331
Pick it up.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.292
Hang it up.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.378
Take it down.

59:10.297 --> 59:11.756
Put it on.

59:13.175 --> 59:14.634
Take it off.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.261
Hang it up.

59:26.772 --> 59:27.813
Mr. Han?

59:29.608 --> 59:31.484
Why do you have a car in your living room?

59:31.818 --> 59:33.444
No street parking.

59:42.162 --> 59:43.287
Hey.

59:44.915 --> 59:46.457
So how did it go?

59:46.541 --> 59:48.251
What'd you learn?

59:48.794 --> 59:50.044
Nothing.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:28.749
Uniform on Uniform Day.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.210
You are fighting in the tournament.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:32.920
Yeah. How did you hear?

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:34.922
Everybody knows.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:40.428
I hope you have a good teacher.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.931
Yeah, me too.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.184
He's a maintenance man.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:49.645
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.522
Well, I know that you're practicing,

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:55.776
and I think I'm practicing.
I mean, I don't know what I'm doing.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.863
But we're both kind of practicing,
you know, and...

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.615
Are you going to the Qi Xi Festival?

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:07.580
Yeah, I mean, I haven't missed
a Shi Vi festival since I've been in China.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:12.793
Go to the Shadow Theater.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.796
Okay. Want me to meet you?

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.176
So, like, Shadow Theater. Okay.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.554
Chi Fi Shi Festival, Shadow Theater.

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.389
Okay, cool.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:27.016
- Okay.
- When is it again?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.934
Tomorrow. Show starts at 7:00.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.773
Okay, so tomorrow, Shadow Theater,
Shi Shi Festival, at 7:00.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:35.399
See you tomorrow.

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:36.901
Ki Shi Festival.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:38.903
Festival.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:40.363
Shi Shi Festival.

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.031
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.762
Mr. Han.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.889
Mr. Han!

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:09.433
- May I come in?
- You may come in.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:16.190
Where's yourjacket?

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.444
I thought... I was warm enough without it.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.029
Go get it.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.448
Want me to go all the way back
just to get it?

01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:26.700
Yes. All the way back where you hide it.

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:55.396
It's not right.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.731
What? I'm doing it.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.652
No.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:03.904
Something is missing.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.698
Nothing's missing.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.459
You forgot this.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.170
Attitude.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.798
Jacket off.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.342
Okay.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.804
Attitude.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.474
Yes. That's it.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:36.395
Okay, Mr. Han, I get it. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated my mom like that.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:37.646
You were right.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.319
Put it on the ground.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:45.905
Hello?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.574
Oh, hey, Mom.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.243
Did you get the tickets?

01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:56.999
Yes, I got the tickets.
And I got an extra one for Mr. Han.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.878
- But I didn't say you...
- Dre, stop it.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.673
Mr. Han, would you like to go
with us to the Shi Shi Festival?

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.091
No, thank you.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:07.760
Too many people.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.429
Yeah, Mom, way too many people.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.723
Yeah, but I already bought the tickets.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.559
- I don't go.
- Mr. Han, I'm not taking no for an answer.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.770
You'll have fun.
You need to get out of the house, okay?

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:22.066
Here are your clothes, Dre.
Come on, hurry up and change.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.612
Dre?

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.449
Pick up yourjacket!

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.090
You were right, Mr. Han.
There are a lot of people here.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.260
Chinese Valentine's Day.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.430
Wow.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.981
This is beautiful.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.067
- Yeah. Mom?
- Yeah?

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:08.404
I'm gonna go get something to eat,
and then I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.114
Be back right here in 20 minutes.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.324
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.243
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Be careful.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.411
Twenty minutes.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.162
- Twenty!
- Okay.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.583
So what's the origin of this festival again?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.793
I know everything you do here
has a meaning.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:42.354
Hi.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.214
Hi.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.341
Hey.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:13.719
Well, I got this and this for you.

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.054
I downloaded this.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.139
And there's this girl,
she has some really cool violin stuff,

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:21.143
and I thought maybe
you could play along and...

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:25.689
It's not like Bach and them,
but I thought maybe you'd like it and...

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:55.177
So do you have any kids?

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:56.929
No.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.433
Well, how's Dre doing?

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.520
Xiao Dre making progress.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:05.604
Xiao Dre?

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.524
Yeah. Chinese for "little."

01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:14.405
So how many students do you have?

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:17.282
- Including Xiao Dre?
- Yeah.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:19.618
One.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:29.753
So, what's this show about?

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:36.093
It's a story of the goddess
and the boy she loves.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.971
I love this story.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:45.477
Her mother does not approve of him.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:49.106
So she cuts a wide river in the sky

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.984
to separate them forever.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:54.111
But once a year,

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.614
all the birds in the sky

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:02.536
feel sad for them and they form a bridge

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:11.044
so the two of them
may be together for a single night.

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:22.973
I'll be there at your audition
if you come to my tournament.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.640
Okay. I'll be there.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.059
Pinky swear?

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.522
See, you wrap your hands like this.

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:35.861
I swear that I'll be there at your audition,
no matter what happens.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:40.365
And I promise to cheer bigger
than anyone else when you win.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.768
What up, Mr. Han?

01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:53.397
Did I say "come in"?

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:56.441
I think you did. I mean...

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.115
Mr. Han, can I please come in?

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:04.658
Yes.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.371
So, what are we doing today?

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.622
Same.

01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:02.257
You know, Mr. Han, I told you.

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:04.217
I get it, okay?

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:06.345
Be respectful. I got it.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:10.557
I put my jacket on a thousand times,
I took it off a thousand times!

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:12.434
Okay? This is stupid.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.852
I'm done.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.313
They can beat me up if they want to.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.858
And you know why
you only have one student?

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.735
'Cause you don't know kung fu.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:23.695
Xiao Dre!

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.238
What?

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:32.704
Come here.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.214
Jacket on.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.549
- Mr. Han, I already...
- Jacket on.

01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:55.394
Jacket on.

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:58.730
- I don't have a jacket now.
- Jacket on.

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.406
Be strong.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:09.908
Jacket on.

01:12:11.703 --> 01:12:12.869
Firm.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.414
Jacket off.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:21.461
Remember, always strong.

01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:24.798
Jacket off.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.303
Strong.

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:32.472
Left foot back.

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:36.643
Right foot back. Left foot back!
Pick up yourjacket!

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.230
- Whoo, Mr... Okay.
- Focus!

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.898
Always concentrate.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.901
Left back.
Right foot back! Pick up yourjacket!

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.237
Stay.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.117
Pick up yourjacket.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:59.291
Be strong. Hang it up.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.752
Hang it up.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:04.337
Hang up. And attitude.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.174
Strike.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.469
Hang up, and attitude.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.679
Harder! Harder!

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.601
Good.

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:19.978
But no face.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.189
Jacket off!

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.173
Kung fu lives in everything we do, Xiao Dre.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:53.095
It lives in how we put on a jacket,
how we take off the jacket.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.349
And lives in how we treat people.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:03.355
Everything is kung fu.

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:49.818
So why didn't we take the Scirocco?

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.654
I don't drive the Scirocco.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.741
Do you have a license?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.411
Yes.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:04.291
So you have a license and a car
and we're on a train?

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.253
Please be quiet.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.796
I'm just saying.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.174
Seems like
we could've saved a lot of money.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:13.925
Don't you think?

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:18.096
Do you always ask this many questions?

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.348
I'm sorry.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.435
So, what are we learning today?

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:27.939
Chi.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:32.110
Internal energy.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.946
The essence of life.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:39.826
It moves inside of us,
it flows through our bodies.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.329
Give us power from within.

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.085
I get it.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.630
Like The Force in Star Wars.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.132
You're Yoda and I'm like...

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:55.550
I'm like a Jedi.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:31.002
Is this where you learned kung fu?

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.170
Yes.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.425
Everything good about me was born here.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.929
Xiao Dre, you can leave your backpack
and skateboard here.

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:43.223
So where we going?

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:45.350
We journey to the top of the mountain.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.686
Drink from the Dragon Well.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.357
Dragon Well.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.361
It's probably closer than it is
than looking at it.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:58.697
Right?

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:29.227
Are we there yet?

01:17:29.729 --> 01:17:30.979
Soon.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:35.900
How do you say "water" in Chinese?

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.112
I need some shui.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.450
I'm really thirsty.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.457
I'm thirsty, Mr. Han.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.584
Water on top of the mountain.

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:11.639
Xiao Dre.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.444
The journey is complete.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.449
Is this the Dragon Well?

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:31.951
Yes.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.167
I stood here

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:42.212
with my father when I was your age.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.798
He told me it's magic kung fu water.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:59.229
You drink, and nothing can defeat you.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:14.202
It's the best water I've ever tasted.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:19.499
Did you see the lady with the snake?

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:20.625
Yes.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:21.793
She was doing the cobra thing.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:26.422
She was, like, copying the snake,
and it was, like, right here.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:28.174
And she was like...

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.928
You did not watch closely enough, Xiao Dre.

01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:35.139
The snake was copying the woman.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:37.892
What?

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.435
I don't get it.

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:50.154
Look.

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.240
What do you see?

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:53.449
Me.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:54.993
Well, my reflection.

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:56.828
Yes.

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:00.915
Now what do you see?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.834
- It's blurry.
- Yes.

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:05.712
The woman was like still water.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:08.423
Quiet, calm.

01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:10.758
In here and in here.

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:17.307
So, the snake reflects her action,
like still water.

01:22:18.017 --> 01:22:19.642
- Like a mirror.
- Yes.

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:25.356
So she controlled a snake by doing nothing?

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:32.697
Being still and doing nothing
are two very different things.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.996
- She used her chi on that snake, didn't she?
- Very good.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:44.208
You've got to teach me that,
like, how to control people.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:48.421
There's only one person
you need to learn how to control.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.426
Who?

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.638
Empty your mind.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:23:00.558
Flow with my movement.
Connect to the energy around you.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.936
I kind ofjust want to learn the cobra thing.

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:06.230
Cobra takes a lifetime.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.982
Requires great focus.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.567
But I have great focus.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.114
Oh, my God. Mr. Han?

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:17.909
Your focus needs more focus.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:20.161
Mr. Han?

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.077
Thank you, Mr. Han.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.602
There is no such thing
as fortune cookies in China?

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.771
Dre, please be careful crossing the street.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:34.902
You scared the life out of me the other day.
Pedestrians do not have the right-of-way.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:41.659
And the symbols. I can't get
the symbols right on the bathrooms.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:44.162
I stay walking into the men's restroom.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:47.331
The other day I walked in,
there was this 90-year-old Chinese man.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.918
He thought he was gonna get a little treat.
Dre, please stop that! You look crazy!

01:24:51.003 --> 01:24:52.920
Here, eat your noodles.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:09.812
Up.

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:19.363
Mr. Han, what's going on?

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.117
Anticipation.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:25.328
I can't...

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:27.872
Don't see it, feel it.

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.833
Damn it, Mr. Han!

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.752
I felt that one!

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.882
- Mr. Han!
- What?

01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:46.098
Concentrate. Okay?

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:47.475
Okay. Do I get the stick now?

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:49.602
Turn. Kick.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:09.872
Ouch.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.916
- Dre, you okay?
- I'm okay!

01:26:16.547 --> 01:26:19.048
So, Mr. Han,
what time we training tomorrow?

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:22.009
Xiao Dre, we are not training tomorrow.

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:24.679
Why not?

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:34.522
Means, "Too much something is not good."
You train a lot. You need rest.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.066
A day off?

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.944
Yes, Mr. Han. Yes.

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:42.363
Xiao Dre needs to rest.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.408
Yes, Mr. Han. You rest, too.

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:47.994
Love you, Mr. Han.

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:49.495
Peace!

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:04.760
Hey.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:07.638
Are you okay?

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.766
My audition is tomorrow at 6:00.

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.102
But isn't that what
you've been practicing for?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.687
Yes, of course.

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:17.273
Don't worry. You got it.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.234
What if they don't pick me?

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:24.655
Mei Ying, wait!

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:29.035
Okay, first of all,
I'm gonna be there with you.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:31.537
And B, all you have to do is
what your teacher says.

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:34.415
Play the pauses. It's easy, watch.

01:27:37.044 --> 01:27:38.085
See?

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.548
I have to practice.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:44.759
Wait.

01:27:46.553 --> 01:27:47.637
What?

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.555
I'm starting to think
you don't speak Chinese.

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:54.852
Too much-a good stuff is bad stuff?

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:58.689
Yeah.

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.653
Come on.

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:04.820
Where are we going?

01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:06.489
- Dang, have you been to the gym?
- Wait, no!

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:08.532
- Come on, we're gonna go have some fun.
- I have to go! No!

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.451
Come on, I know you want
to go have some fun.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:42.191
Okay, that's gonna give you
some serious gas.

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:53.452
Don't do it.

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:54.578
Don't do it.

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:58.874
What do you see?

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:00.042
Me.

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.503
Now what do you see?

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:04.672
Me.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:35.703
You go. Come on.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:39.331
<i>You're a dance machine.</i>
<i>That was pretty good.</i>

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:41.667
Go ahead.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.128
<i>Here comes Round 2.</i>

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.557
<i>You're hot!</i>

01:30:44.022 --> 01:30:46.857
That's like American dancing.
Like, you should have a group...

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:48.025
No.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:53.447
...with, like, other people in it, and they're
dancing behind you, doing the same stuff.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:09.505
The audition, it was changed to today.

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.340
- But they said it was tomorrow.
- Something happened.

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:13.384
It's in 20 minutes.

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:16.011
My father is coming to get me.

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.726
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.937
Excuse me, coming through!

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.452
Come on, come on.

01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:24.181
Excuse me!

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:22.823
Hey, she's, like, totally gonna get in, right?
Because that was just great.

01:34:57.275 --> 01:34:59.902
Hey, that was fantastic.

01:35:01.905 --> 01:35:04.281
You played so beautifully and...

01:35:05.283 --> 01:35:07.076
We can no longer be friends.

01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:10.746
You are bad for my life.

01:35:25.095 --> 01:35:26.261
See you at the tournament.

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.265
Don't be late for that.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:16.979
Mr. Han!

01:36:17.814 --> 01:36:19.189
Mr. Han!

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.863
We no train today.

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.172
What are you doing?

01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:45.883
It's June 8th.

01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:00.123
Why'd you break the car?

01:38:19.686 --> 01:38:21.603
His name was Gong Gong.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:26.108
Xiao Dre, how old are you?

01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:28.986
Twelve.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:31.613
He was 10.

01:38:33.783 --> 01:38:35.534
He was so beautiful.

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:41.290
Her name was Zhang.

01:38:43.459 --> 01:38:45.168
She was a singer.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.008
Not professional.

01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:55.679
She sang only for me.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:35.385
What happened?

01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:46.730
It was a steep hill.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.608
Lots of rain.

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:53.570
The carjust...

01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:58.241
I was driving.

01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:02.079
We argue about something.

01:40:04.248 --> 01:40:05.957
I was so angry.

01:40:06.918 --> 01:40:08.543
I lost control.

01:40:09.796 --> 01:40:11.755
I try to remember.

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:16.426
I cannot remember what we argue about.

01:40:18.388 --> 01:40:20.931
I hope it was something important.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.061
Every year,

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:28.814
I fix the car.

01:40:30.233 --> 01:40:31.942
Still fix nothing.

01:44:19.337 --> 01:44:20.503
Punch.

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.505
Good.

01:45:23.234 --> 01:45:24.317
Mr. Han.

01:45:54.473 --> 01:45:55.932
Look at me.

01:45:56.017 --> 01:45:57.183
Down!

01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:16.786
Faster!

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:18.955
One more.

01:46:23.544 --> 01:46:24.836
Come here.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.349
Win or lose, doesn't matter.

01:47:20.518 --> 01:47:22.018
Fight hard.

01:47:23.854 --> 01:47:26.189
Earn respect. Boys leave you alone.

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:34.030
Have present for you.

01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:41.121
Mr. Han!

01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:42.247
Man!

01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:44.415
This is the one Bruce Lee had.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:46.876
Great.

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:49.712
Thank you.

01:47:53.092 --> 01:47:56.219
You have taught me
a very important lesson, Xiao Dre.

01:47:58.472 --> 01:48:00.598
Life will knock us down.

01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:05.395
But we can choose
whether or not to get back up.

01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:12.152
You're the best friend I ever had, Mr. Han.

01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:31.421
Okay.

01:48:35.426 --> 01:48:37.927
Wait, can you help me with something?

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:44.309
Dre?

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:46.603
Is your dad home?

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:54.527
Sir...

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:56.821
...my name is Dre Parker.

01:48:57.948 --> 01:48:59.949
My actions have brought...

01:49:00.201 --> 01:49:04.287
...dishonor to your family.

01:49:05.122 --> 01:49:09.626
Your daughter
has been a great friend to me.

01:49:10.836 --> 01:49:13.296
And from her, I have learned...

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.632
...that a true friend...

01:49:16.217 --> 01:49:19.135
...is a person who makes your life better.

01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:23.890
But, if you give me a second chance...

01:49:25.142 --> 01:49:28.978
...I promise that I will be...

01:49:29.813 --> 01:49:35.235
...the best friend your daughter has ever had.

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:41.157
That's it.

01:49:56.715 --> 01:50:01.678
My daughter told me that she made
a promise to be at your tournament.

01:50:02.263 --> 01:50:05.848
In our family, we do not break our promises.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.521
Good luck.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.450
Rock and roll.

01:50:46.598 --> 01:50:47.640
Hi!

01:50:48.058 --> 01:50:49.058
Hey!

01:50:51.228 --> 01:50:53.604
Let the tournament begin!

01:51:26.764 --> 01:51:28.097
We're up.

01:51:30.809 --> 01:51:32.769
- What's that?
- Rulebook.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:35.938
- You don't know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules.

01:51:36.357 --> 01:51:38.858
Simple. You hit him, don't let him hit you.

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:41.986
What? Mr...

01:51:42.488 --> 01:51:44.280
They're gonna kill me.

01:51:45.449 --> 01:51:46.783
Two points to win.

01:51:47.493 --> 01:51:51.120
Go. Hit him two times.
Focus, focus. Come on.

01:52:05.386 --> 01:52:06.552
Dre!

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:12.850
Come on, Dre!

01:52:21.735 --> 01:52:23.945
That's a warning.
You cannot run out of the mat.

01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:25.655
Next time, you lose a point.

01:52:25.989 --> 01:52:27.824
Go. Hey, be strong.

01:52:28.492 --> 01:52:29.826
Come on, Dre.

01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:06.028
Good job. Next time, no face.

01:53:06.113 --> 01:53:08.030
- I'm sorry, I can't help it.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:53:08.115 --> 01:53:09.449
Next point, winner.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:11.200
Come on, baby!

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:32.805
Yeah!

01:54:32.533 --> 01:54:34.408
That's right, baby!

01:54:57.432 --> 01:54:58.558
Go.

01:56:15.135 --> 01:56:19.138
Dre Parker advances to the semi-finals!

01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:23.309
From now on, semi-final matches.
Three points to win.

01:56:23.685 --> 01:56:26.020
Be kind of hot
if I won this thing, right, Mr. Han?

01:56:26.104 --> 01:56:27.813
Be kind of hot if you focus.

01:56:28.857 --> 01:56:30.316
Yeah, well, after that.

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.746
And now the first semi-final of the evening...

01:58:59.591 --> 01:58:59.673
Next semi-final
introducing Fighting Dragon, Liang...

01:58:59.674 --> 01:59:03.010
Next semi-final
introducing Fighting Dragon, Liang...

01:59:05.889 --> 01:59:08.140
...and the surprise finalist, Dre Parker.

01:59:21.279 --> 01:59:22.988
But, I can beat him.

01:59:23.073 --> 01:59:24.782
I do not want him beaten.

01:59:24.866 --> 01:59:25.950
I want him broken.

01:59:32.958 --> 01:59:34.792
Empty your mind.

01:59:34.876 --> 01:59:36.085
Focus.

02:00:43.737 --> 02:00:45.237
You're disqualified!

02:00:50.785 --> 02:00:52.912
Be still. Xiao Dre.

02:00:53.496 --> 02:00:54.830
You okay?

02:01:08.553 --> 02:01:10.095
Don't move. Don't move.

02:01:19.064 --> 02:01:20.481
He's done.

02:01:21.858 --> 02:01:23.442
I'm sorry, you should not continue.

02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:26.820
You've brought honor to your family.

02:01:29.783 --> 02:01:31.951
Doctor says you did great.

02:01:43.505 --> 02:01:44.838
You okay, baby?

02:01:44.923 --> 02:01:46.423
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:52.388
Dre Parker has 2 minutes
to return to the match.

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:54.723
If he is unable to return...

02:01:54.808 --> 02:01:59.353
...the Fighting Dragons win by default.

02:02:01.690 --> 02:02:03.565
Can you guys give us a second?

02:02:05.402 --> 02:02:08.654
Yeah, okay. Sure, baby, whatever you need.

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.040
Do you think I could have won?

02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:24.169
Win or lose doesn't matter, Xiao Dre.

02:02:25.630 --> 02:02:28.090
You know that's not what I mean.

02:02:32.637 --> 02:02:36.015
Yes. I think you had a good chance.

02:02:39.394 --> 02:02:41.812
So let's do the fiery cup thing.

02:02:44.816 --> 02:02:47.151
You don't need to fight anymore.

02:02:47.235 --> 02:02:49.153
You have proven everything
you need to prove.

02:02:49.612 --> 02:02:53.449
What, that I can get beat up easy
and then quit?

02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:56.410
That's not balance. That's not real kung fu.

02:02:56.494 --> 02:02:58.954
You said that when life knocks you down,

02:02:59.289 --> 02:03:02.291
you could choose
whether or not to get back up.

02:03:02.375 --> 02:03:05.085
Well, I'm trying to get back up,
and why won't you help me?

02:03:09.049 --> 02:03:13.177
Because I cannot watch you
get hurt anymore.

02:03:18.016 --> 02:03:19.641
Please, Mr. Han.

02:03:20.727 --> 02:03:22.061
Please.

02:03:23.396 --> 02:03:25.773
Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why?

02:03:26.399 --> 02:03:28.484
Why you need to
go back out there so badly?

02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:35.365
Because I'm still scared.

02:03:37.744 --> 02:03:39.912
No matter what happens,

02:03:39.996 --> 02:03:41.955
tonight, when I leave,

02:03:42.624 --> 02:03:44.792
I don't want to be scared anymore.

02:03:57.263 --> 02:04:01.975
Since Dre Parker has not
returned to the ring...

02:04:22.539 --> 02:04:25.124
Dre Parker will fight!

02:06:18.488 --> 02:06:19.696
Xiao Dre.

02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:38.548
Come on, Dre. You can do this, Dre.

02:08:23.863 --> 02:08:24.905
You okay?

02:08:25.281 --> 02:08:26.406
Yeah. I'm okay.

02:08:30.203 --> 02:08:31.578
I want you...

02:08:32.663 --> 02:08:35.207
...to break his leg.

02:08:37.001 --> 02:08:38.752
No mercy.

02:09:53.494 --> 02:09:56.997
The score is tied, the next point wins!

02:10:04.213 --> 02:10:06.798
Can you continue?

02:10:37.747 --> 02:10:39.080
Come on, Dre.

02:12:02.665 --> 02:12:03.915
Finish him!

02:12:34.697 --> 02:12:36.281
You won!

02:13:24.747 --> 02:13:25.872
Dre! Dre!

02:13:29.418 --> 02:13:31.336
I'm so proud of you!

02:13:35.341 --> 02:13:36.383
Good.
