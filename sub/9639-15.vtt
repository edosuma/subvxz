WEBVTT

00:05.830 --> 00:07.620
Dude, close your mouth.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.060
Your tongue is gonna dry out.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.960
You're right.

00:18.170 --> 00:19.930
Listen, man.
Why don't you just ask her out?

00:20.070 --> 00:21.370
Kari Langsdorf?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.940
l can't ask out Kari Langsdorf.
She's got no idea who l am.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.440
She's never even talked to me.
l'm totally invisible to her.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.480
- Sorry, man. l didn't see you there.
- Why would you?

00:31.950 --> 00:33.850
Totally invisible to everybody.

00:34.390 --> 00:36.550
Hey, Kari, you wanna check out
a movie this weekend?

00:36.690 --> 00:37.850
Do you play baseball?

00:38.330 --> 00:40.320
No, but l'm quarterback
of the football team,

00:40.460 --> 00:43.330
president of student council
and l'm a swimsuit model.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.060
l only date baseball players.

00:51.970 --> 00:53.200
Oh, sorry.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.140
Didn't see you there.

00:57.180 --> 01:00.480
- So, Justin, do you play baseball?
- Yes.

01:00.610 --> 01:02.910
- You gonna try out for the team this year?
- l might.

01:03.050 --> 01:04.379
You think you got a shot?

01:05.250 --> 01:06.340
Absolutely not.

02:03.580 --> 02:05.640
Hey, Alex, can l get a turkey sandwich?

02:05.780 --> 02:09.039
l'm off the clock.
You know where everything is.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.950
Well, if you're off the clock,
then what are we doing here?

02:12.090 --> 02:15.540
l've got a jean jacket at home
that's not going to sequin itself.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.950
Relax, Harper, we're just waiting
for my dad to come back

02:18.090 --> 02:20.790
with the team he's coaching
so we can see the cute guys.

02:20.930 --> 02:24.990
All right, guys.
Root beer floats are on the house.

02:26.030 --> 02:28.590
Hey, Justin tried out for the first time,
and even made the team.

02:28.740 --> 02:29.900
Who knew?

02:30.040 --> 02:33.340
Well, l know how much you love baseball,
so l figured l'd give it a shot.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.910
Awesome. Then it's settled.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.980
l'm the Aztecs' number one fan.

02:37.110 --> 02:39.270
Let the trash talking begin.

02:39.780 --> 02:41.300
Dad, he's doing it again.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.880
Maxy, we really appreciate
the enthusiasm,

02:44.020 --> 02:46.540
but let's not revisit
what happened on the soccer field.

02:46.890 --> 02:47.980
What soccer field?

02:48.460 --> 02:50.920
The one the park police
said you can't go to anymore.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.260
Excuse me for cheering for my brother.
ls that a crime?

02:54.690 --> 02:57.390
According to the park police, yes.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.830
The kid in the diaper started it.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.490
Hey, Alex,
do you have an extra-long spoon?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.800
Sure. Okay.

03:13.550 --> 03:14.610
Here you go, Riley.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.040
Thanks.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.950
What was that?
l thought you were off the clock.

03:22.090 --> 03:25.550
l'm always on the clock for Riley.
lsn't he so cute?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.020
You mean Justin.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.350
No, Riley.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.660
Justin's cute.

03:34.970 --> 03:36.600
l can't believe Justin's on Riley's team.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.930
Finally, after years of Justin
being a bore,

03:40.070 --> 03:42.230
l can use him
for my own personal gain.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.040
- How are you going to do that?
- l have no idea.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.650
But it's a nice feeling,

03:46.780 --> 03:49.540
the kind that makes you stop
and give thanks you have a brother.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.310
Here he comes. How do l look?

03:51.450 --> 03:53.210
- Fine.
- Just fine?

03:53.350 --> 03:55.250
Fine isn't good enough.

03:55.390 --> 03:57.450
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

03:57.860 --> 03:58.950
Hey.

03:59.090 --> 04:01.620
Hey, Justin.
Congrats on making the team Riley's on.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.790
Baseball, right?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.690
Yep, l made the team, all right.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.820
You don't sound all right.
What's the matter?

04:08.970 --> 04:12.460
l've done a bad, bad thing, Alex.

04:12.610 --> 04:13.660
What?

04:18.110 --> 04:20.550
l charmed the baseball
so Dad would think l was good.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.170
l didn't know you were into baseball.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.310
l'm not. l'm into Kari Langsdorf.

04:24.450 --> 04:27.780
Okay, so, what's the bad,
bad thing you did?

04:27.920 --> 04:30.950
l cheated.
l used magic to make the baseball team.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.820
lf Dad knew, he would flip out.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.420
Yeah, but the important thing is,

04:35.560 --> 04:39.660
is now you're on the baseball team
with Riley.

04:40.770 --> 04:41.830
What?

04:43.440 --> 04:45.730
Well, Riley's the catcher,
so he can teach you some stuff.

04:45.870 --> 04:49.470
But until then, you should probably
use magic to stay on the team.

04:49.610 --> 04:51.840
Alex, l'm not like you.
l don't break the rules.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.240
l'm ridden with guilt.
lt's eating up my insides.

04:54.380 --> 04:57.980
Pretty soon, l'll be just a shell.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.650
You'll get over it.
And, Justin, magic is your talent.

05:01.790 --> 05:04.450
l mean, do they make a tall
basketball player play on his knees?

05:04.590 --> 05:05.650
No.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.850
Do they make a fast swimmer
only do the dog paddle?

05:07.990 --> 05:09.260
No.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.590
Then why should a wizard
not use magic?

05:12.970 --> 05:14.090
Hey.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.960
Congratulations on making the team.
l'm Kari.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.770
Hi, Kari. l'm Just-- Just--

05:21.140 --> 05:23.170
- l'm Just--
- Just so happy to meet you.

05:23.310 --> 05:25.570
Yes, he is. And his name is Justin.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.700
Well, it's nice to meet you, Justin.

05:27.850 --> 05:29.610
l love going to the baseball games,

05:29.750 --> 05:32.510
so l'm sure we'll be seeing a lot
of each other at the baseball games,

05:32.650 --> 05:35.450
because you play
in the baseball games.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.180
l love baseball.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.830
She can see me.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.160
She can totally see me.
l'm not invisible anymore.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.960
No way.
You know the invisibility spell?

05:48.100 --> 05:49.860
l'll trade you for the popularity spell.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.870
You know what?
l am totally gonna use magic.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.440
Thanks, Alex.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.910
You always know
the right wrong thing to do.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.810
Now go sit by Riley
and tell him how cool l am.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.610
Here we go. Come on now.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.090
Ball four. Take your base.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.530
Time, ump.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.290
Time.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.660
Yeah, Justin!

06:25.810 --> 06:28.400
He and l are gonna be going out soon.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.510
Nice job today. Nice job.

06:33.110 --> 06:36.010
All right, Justin.
Let's see if you can finish this thing.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.380
Justin looks great in his uniform.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.420
He slept in it last night.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.490
l find that totally attractive.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.360
Alex, here comes Riley.
Do you wanna talk to him alone?

06:58.510 --> 07:00.770
- That would be nice.
- Got it.

07:00.910 --> 07:03.970
lf you need me, l'll be over here.
Hi, Justin.

07:04.110 --> 07:06.240
Hey, Riley. Cute uniform.

07:06.380 --> 07:10.040
Thanks. lt was my idea
to go with the sleeveless jerseys.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.150
- l'm gonna be your good luck charm.
- What?

07:13.290 --> 07:14.720
Whenever l'm here, you'll win.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.290
lf this guy strikes out and we win,
l'll believe you.

07:20.530 --> 07:21.790
You'll see.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.330
- Good eye, baby. Good eye.
- Get the strikes.

07:28.470 --> 07:32.100
Get this guy out and we win.
lf you don't, we lose.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.330
No pressure.

07:35.810 --> 07:38.710
Come on, Justin. Good luck, Justin.

07:38.850 --> 07:41.580
Throw a knuckleball.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.840
Come on, Justin.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.080
Mow this guy down. He ain't no hitter.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.250
He couldn't hit it
if you threw a basketball.

07:50.390 --> 07:53.450
Hey, kid, do you mind? That's my son.

07:53.590 --> 07:55.990
Oh, l'm sorry. For you.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.010
Lead-off hitter. Lead-off hitter.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.040
- That's all right.
- All right, baby.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.570
Strike one.

08:14.850 --> 08:17.150
That's my brother. l'm his brother.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.720
Together, we'll send you losers home.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.290
Nice work, son. Bring in the heat.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.820
Strike two.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.549
Amazing, huh?

08:33.070 --> 08:37.559
You feel that heat, losers?

08:42.380 --> 08:44.430
Strike three. You're out.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.540
- Game over.
- Nice.

08:59.630 --> 09:00.960
Way to go, loser.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.790
You should change
your first name to Lou

09:02.930 --> 09:04.400
and your last name to Sir.

09:04.530 --> 09:07.160
Get it? ''Loser.''

09:07.900 --> 09:12.570
Oh, boy.
You ever seen a kid pitch like that, huh?

09:12.770 --> 09:16.260
Come to think of it,
l've never seen a kid pitch like that either.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.510
Something's not right.

09:26.490 --> 09:28.280
You were awesome
out there today, Justin.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.690
Those batters had no clue
what you were throwing at them.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.350
- Like they had never seen pitches before.
- That's what l do.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.550
Throw them the dark stuff,
turn up the heat,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.600
give them a little pop-goes-the-weasel.

09:37.730 --> 09:39.200
Pop-goes-the-weasel?

09:39.330 --> 09:41.060
ls that like a baseball term?

09:42.170 --> 09:44.530
Yeah, in Taiwan,

09:44.670 --> 09:46.140
where l learned the pitch.

09:46.270 --> 09:49.110
Oh, l'm glad we finally met.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.110
See you around.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.310
Just, l need to talk to you.

09:53.450 --> 09:54.740
As my dad or as my coach?

09:55.220 --> 09:57.380
As your magic teacher.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.180
You broke the rules.
You never break the rules.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.810
Do they make a tall basketball player
do the dog paddle?

10:02.960 --> 10:05.580
Do they make a fast swimmer
swim on his knees?

10:05.730 --> 10:06.890
What are you talking about?

10:07.030 --> 10:09.290
Alex told me to use magic.

10:09.430 --> 10:12.230
Here's some advice.
Stop listening to your sister.

10:12.370 --> 10:13.760
Got it. E-mail to self:

10:13.900 --> 10:16.770
''Stop listening to evil sister.''

10:16.900 --> 10:20.530
Justin, l'm very disappointed in you.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.770
You've always been a stickler
for the rules.

10:23.380 --> 10:26.710
- All right, fine. l'll quit the team.
- No, you're not quitting the team.

10:26.850 --> 10:29.440
You're gonna learn your lesson
by pitching without magic.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.310
l'll get creamed.

10:31.450 --> 10:33.890
Exactly.
That's the learning your lesson part.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.660
l'm ready for Justin's second game.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.100
Max, don't you think
that foam finger's a little big?

10:46.230 --> 10:49.360
No, but this one might be.

10:52.910 --> 10:56.770
Hey, if it rains,
you can mop up the infield for us.

10:57.540 --> 11:00.510
That's a good one, Dad. Yeah.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.370
Hey, Alex.
You ready to go to the game?

11:04.520 --> 11:06.180
- Come on.
- Nope.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.580
l'm not going today.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.420
But you're Riley's good luck charm.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.220
My dad's making Justin pitch
even though he can't use a spell.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.120
Spell?

11:15.030 --> 11:18.160
Yeah. Justin had a spelling test
and couldn't practice pitching.

11:18.730 --> 11:20.220
Yeah, that works. Nice.

11:20.370 --> 11:23.200
So he's gonna get clobbered
and the team's gonna lose.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.670
But don't you wanna see Riley?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.500
Yes, but not if they're gonna lose.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.300
That's just gonna show Riley
that l'm not his good luck charm.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.970
But he might wish you were there.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.910
l know. That's the good part.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.180
l won't be there,
which will reinforce the idea

11:37.320 --> 11:39.310
that l am his good luck charm.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.910
Okay...

11:42.060 --> 11:44.220
But l think it would be fun to see Riley.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.090
Let me explain this to you slowly.

12:09.550 --> 12:12.310
- lt's a run.
- Good job, crew.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.440
Let me ask you something.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.380
l know, l know.
l'm getting creamed out here.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.460
Right, right.

12:51.590 --> 12:54.890
Hey, does your sister
ever ask about me?

13:02.600 --> 13:05.070
l know it was tough going today, Justin.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.540
Tough going?

13:06.670 --> 13:08.260
l gave up 26 runs.

13:08.410 --> 13:10.540
Their guys kept running around
and around and around

13:10.680 --> 13:13.170
- and around and around and around--
- Justin.

13:13.310 --> 13:16.340
Justin, listen.

13:17.950 --> 13:20.440
Only one of my kids
is gonna be able to keep his powers.

13:20.590 --> 13:24.250
l don't want you relying on magic,
because you might not have it one day.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.420
All right, all right. l get it.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.150
l never liked baseball anyway.

13:28.290 --> 13:30.090
Then why did you try out for the team?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.900
To impress Kari Langsdorf.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.360
l get it.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.440
You know, when l was your age,
l tried using magic to impress a girl.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.560
Turned into a total disaster.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.270
- What happened?
- l married her.

13:44.410 --> 13:46.210
Just kidding.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.470
Seriously, l'm just kidding.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.740
Don't even say l said that,
even as a joke.

13:52.620 --> 13:55.610
The point is, using magic is cheating.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.990
And cheating to impress people
ultimately fails.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.920
So l suggest you practice hard,

14:02.060 --> 14:04.030
because l've decided
to pitch you again next game.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.530
Dad, without magic,
l'll get creamed again.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.230
Not necessarily.
You have some of my natural ability.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.460
We just have to find it.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.590
- Do l have a choice?
- No.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.670
Look, son, you made a commitment
and you have to stick to it.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.240
You think l can do better
than l did today?

14:19.010 --> 14:21.040
lt'd be hard to do worse.

14:21.180 --> 14:22.340
All right.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.780
- All right, fine. l'll give it a shot.
- No magic, right?

14:25.520 --> 14:28.080
- No magic. Got it.
- Okay.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.560
You see? They lost.

14:32.690 --> 14:33.950
So if l'd gone to the game,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.120
l couldn't possibly be
Riley's good luck charm.

14:36.260 --> 14:37.890
And then he wouldn't be
interested in me.

14:38.030 --> 14:39.830
Do you understand that?

14:40.230 --> 14:42.700
Oh, l get it. Good plan.

14:43.940 --> 14:46.770
Now let's talk about something
that's really important.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.000
Your brother's baseball uniform.

14:49.140 --> 14:52.110
How cute is he in that?

14:52.910 --> 14:55.510
Alex, where were you today?
We got smeared.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.010
l've been studying.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.720
She wasn't there and you lost.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.620
Sounds like she's
your good luck charm.

15:05.220 --> 15:06.820
You're welcome.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.720
l'm sorry, Riley.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.060
l didn't know you wanted me
to come to every game.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.330
Yeah. You're our good luck charm.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.700
And we need good luck every game.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.300
Every game? l don't know.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.740
l'll tell you what.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.070
lf you come to our next game
and we win,

15:25.210 --> 15:26.700
l'll take you to the fall dance.

15:27.380 --> 15:30.410
And what makes you think
l'd wanna go to the fall dance with you?

15:30.550 --> 15:33.920
Every girl does, don't they?

15:34.390 --> 15:36.360
Yeah, you're right. Okay, you got a deal.

15:36.890 --> 15:39.220
Great. Because l'm very superstitious.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.420
But with you,

15:40.560 --> 15:43.430
l got a feeling we'll go all the way
to the state championship.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.090
And all the way to the fall dance.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.830
See you.

15:48.940 --> 15:50.270
Oh, wait.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.630
What are you gonna do
if Justin pitches badly next game,

15:52.770 --> 15:55.710
they lose, and Riley realizes
you're not his good luck charm?

15:56.340 --> 15:58.280
As long as l have
something to do with it,

15:58.410 --> 16:02.210
l'm pretty sure Justin's team
will win the next game.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.850
Oh, come on, Justin.

16:11.990 --> 16:15.190
l didn't paint my face
for a tied-up game.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.760
This stuff is starting to burn.
ls that bad?

16:21.570 --> 16:24.870
l sure hope Justin gets out of this jam,
otherwise you're not good luck.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.870
And l was up half the night with my mom
trying to figure this out.

16:28.010 --> 16:30.770
So when you're there, he wins,
and when you're not, he doesn't.

16:31.540 --> 16:34.480
Don't worry.
l know Justin will get out of this.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.960
Batter's out of there.

16:56.540 --> 16:57.590
Good job. Good job.

16:57.740 --> 16:59.600
- Thanks, coach.
- Nice.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.830
Justin, is there something
you wanna tell me?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.970
No. ls there something
you wanna tell me?

17:05.750 --> 17:07.940
- No.
- All right.

17:08.550 --> 17:10.109
Good talk. Good talk.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.650
Let's play some ball.

17:27.400 --> 17:28.460
Time, ump.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.900
Time.

17:31.370 --> 17:32.700
Justin.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.970
You're calling timeout
to talk to a guy sitting on the bench?

17:36.110 --> 17:37.870
There's no rule against it.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.650
- l told you l didn't do it.
- l know, l know.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.680
l was watching you.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.750
There's something going on, though,

17:46.890 --> 17:49.450
so l want you to use your powers
to counteract it.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.750
Keep the game fair.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.020
Okay...

17:56.260 --> 17:57.490
Un-time.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.690
Play ball.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.820
Come on, let's go.
Everybody on the bench.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.630
Safe.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.280
Timeout, ump. Timeout.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.220
Time.

18:51.350 --> 18:52.540
Alex, get over here.

18:53.890 --> 18:56.320
You're calling timeout to talk to a fan?

18:56.460 --> 18:58.550
Show me the rule, ump.
Show me the rule.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.990
l know what you're doing, young lady,
and l want it to stop.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.760
l was just trying to help.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.760
- Here, Justin, recite this spell.
- What is it?

19:12.910 --> 19:14.370
lt will erase everyone's memory

19:14.510 --> 19:16.810
so they won't remember
what happened the past few minutes.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.570
- Even ours?
- l don't know.

19:18.710 --> 19:21.740
l don't remember. l've never used it.

19:22.110 --> 19:23.310
All right.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.140
Cerebellum erasis

19:34.160 --> 19:35.650
What just happened?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.160
We won. We won.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.730
ln your face, losers.
Go home and cry, you little babies.

19:41.870 --> 19:46.240
l smell smoke,
because you were burned.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.770
There he is. Get him. Get him.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.340
Dad, l don't remember
how the game ended.

19:57.220 --> 19:59.210
Neither do l.

19:59.350 --> 20:02.220
l think Alex had something to do with it.

20:02.350 --> 20:03.950
What's that piece of paper?

20:04.890 --> 20:08.690
Hey, this could
come in handy someday.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.340
So Alex, looks like l've got a date
for the fall dance.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.410
Yes, you do. And Friday night too.

20:24.540 --> 20:25.700
We're going out Friday night?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.280
Yeah, you asked me
right after you scored the winning run.

20:28.410 --> 20:29.540
Don't you remember?

20:30.750 --> 20:33.510
Yeah, sure. Great.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.120
Looking forward to Friday night.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.780
Yes, you are.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.720
l know what you did, Alex.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.090
You broke the rules and used magic

20:45.230 --> 20:47.390
because you wanted Riley
to ask you out.

20:47.530 --> 20:51.590
l did no such thing.
And it totally worked.

20:52.140 --> 20:53.230
l don't think it did.

20:54.910 --> 20:57.380
- What are you talking about?
- Your punishment.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.310
- You're not going to the fall dance.
- What?

21:00.450 --> 21:02.640
Justin used magic.
Where's his punishment?

21:02.780 --> 21:04.750
Justin was already punished
on the baseball field

21:04.880 --> 21:10.620
when the other team ran around
and around and around.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.350
- Hi, Kari.
- Oh, hey, Justin.

21:14.490 --> 21:17.020
- Mind if l join you?
- Please do.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.130
So l was wondering, since you like
baseball players and everything

21:20.270 --> 21:24.230
if maybe you'd not want to not go
to a movie or something?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.600
Did you just ask me out?

21:26.740 --> 21:29.140
l think so. l was trying to.

21:30.380 --> 21:31.430
Okay, sure.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.570
- l'd love to go to a movie with you.
- Excellent.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.510
So we're on this weekend.
What movie do you wanna see?

21:36.650 --> 21:39.980
Oh, l only date baseball players,
and l only see movies about--

21:40.120 --> 21:43.180
- Baseball.
- No, cats.

21:44.860 --> 21:46.450
Okay.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.420
Are there any movies out right now
about cats?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.030
No.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.560
Would you see a movie about dogs?

21:54.230 --> 21:57.290
Not unless they're cats
disguised as dogs.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.330
Farm animals?

21:59.810 --> 22:02.240
Are the cats, like,
disguised as farm animals,

22:02.370 --> 22:05.140
like, cows and stuff?

22:07.280 --> 22:09.300
Yeah.

22:11.420 --> 22:12.480
l'll tell you what.

22:12.950 --> 22:14.780
Why don't we wait
till a cat movie comes out?

22:14.920 --> 22:17.510
l'll keep an eye on the paper, real close.

22:17.660 --> 22:20.280
Good talking to you, Kari.
