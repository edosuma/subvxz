WEBVTT

00:04.255 --> 00:07.372
That must be them there
near that big piece of nothing.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.172
[Brennan]
According to my G.P.S.,

00:09.260 --> 00:11.421
it’s about where Texas
turns into Oklahoma.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.801
Oh, great. Right in the middle
ofa jurisdictional pissing contest.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.680
Look, I’m out ofwater.
Give me yours.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.271
Hey!

00:22.440 --> 00:25.227
[Texas Ranger]
Hey! Are y’all F.B.l.?

00:25.318 --> 00:27.309
F.B.|. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

00:27.403 --> 00:30.315
This here is
Dr. Temperance Brennan
from theJeffersonian.

00:30.406 --> 00:33.569
- [Trooper]
Welcome to Oklahoma, ma’am.
- Welcome to Texas, ma’am.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.320
Guys, welcome to
the United States of America.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.660
Where are
the remains, please?
Oh!

00:37.747 --> 00:40.159
Right here.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.293
[Brennan]
Hardly any ﬁes/7 leﬁ‘.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.371
It’s ve/y dry here,

00:48.466 --> 00:51.048
so I’m guessing
that time of death
was some months ago.

00:51.177 --> 00:55.796
How do you think they died?
They left Oklahoma, hit Texas,
then died ofdespair.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.723
Nope. They’re definitely Oklahomans.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.186
Ifthey were from Texas,
they’d have had sense enough
to carry water.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.647
That wouldn’t show up
in the bones.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.891
Maybe a young couple,
some kind of suicide pact?

01:08.986 --> 01:12.023
Sub -,oub/'c ang/e
suggests two females.

01:12.114 --> 01:15.447
- Oh! Lesbian suicide pact.
- Definitely Texans then.

01:15.534 --> 01:19.368
The victims were ,oygopagus
or, some would say, i//eo,oagus.

01:19.455 --> 01:22.037
- What’s that?
- Greek?
- Conjoined twins.

01:22.124 --> 01:24.080
- What’s that?
- Siamese twins.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.659
The point of attachment
is posterior.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.042
- Ah, joined at the ass.
- [Chuckles] Definitely Texans.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.214
50 what do we got here, Doc?

01:32.301 --> 01:34.963
Well, it’s a federal case, boys.
F.B.|. will takejurisdiction.

01:40.351 --> 01:44.765
[Vincent]
Conjoined twin births occur
once every 85,000 births,

01:44.855 --> 01:47.346
the same frequency
as hermaphroditic births.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.104
0h, Mr. N/gel-Murra y,
we ’I/e so missed
your insights.

01:51.195 --> 01:54.608
- Thank you.
- Why weren’t the remains
dispersed by scavengers?

01:54.699 --> 01:56.655
Well, the depression
in the earth suggested...

01:56.742 --> 01:59.654
that they were buried
in an extremely
shallow grave.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.157
The remains were spotted
by an oil survey team
from a helicopter.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.705
Begging the question,
what exposed the bones?

02:04.792 --> 02:08.330
Well, there was a sano’storm
in that area eight days ago.

02:08.421 --> 02:11.413
Susta/neo’ winds
of 60 miles an hour;
gusts of about 80.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.920
Third molars have not completely emerged,
and root development is incomplete.

02:15.011 --> 02:19.004
Indicating that the vict/ms were
between l9 and 27 years of age.

02:19.098 --> 02:23.091
Guys, hello. |.D.’ing them
is not going to be a problem.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.312
How many sets
of conjoined twins can there be?

02:25.396 --> 02:28.980
Um, over the last 5 00 years,
apprOX/ma te/y 600 sets,

02:29.066 --> 02:31.603
o ver 70 percent women.

02:31.694 --> 02:34.151
I did not expect him
to know that.

02:34.238 --> 02:38.026
Well, all facts are useful.
/t’syust the context that shifts.

02:38.117 --> 02:41.154
/ bet / could just go search
for missing Siamese twins...

02:41.245 --> 02:43.156
and find them
in, like, 10 minutes.

02:43.247 --> 02:48.162
- By all means, give it a shot.
- The victims have two separate spinal columns...

02:48.252 --> 02:51.540
fused distally at the lower sacral level,
extending to the pelvis.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.621
No other vertebral anomalies.

02:53.716 --> 02:56.082
Neither one ofthem could’ve survived
the death ofthe other.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.920
So murder/suicide,
suicide/murder or vice versa.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.255
That was vice versa.

03:02.350 --> 03:06.218
[Device Beeps]
Soil beneath the skeletons
was full ofweirdness.

03:06.312 --> 03:08.303
Quite a bit
of decomposed cotton.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.389
- We didn’t see any fabric.
- Wow. It was decomposed.

03:11.484 --> 03:14.351
It was fairly cheap stuff too.
I think they were wrapped in a sheet.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.527
Naked, wrapped in a sheet.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.570
Sweets will have something
to say about that.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.865
A/so, / founo’ soil-o’we/hng
mites— genus Ameronoth rus.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.739
Nearest place they cou/d’ve
picked up soi/ mites was
hundreds of miles a way.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.412
And decomposed popcorn.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.582
They were killed
at the movies?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.951
I have a theory—
The circus.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.087
Kind of stole
my thunder there.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.961
But yeah. Yeah.
The tra ve/ing circus.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.302
I found them.
[Saroyan]
Already?

03:42.390 --> 03:44.676
J‘J‘ [ Fanfare]

03:47.019 --> 03:48.975
- [Angela] Huh? The circus.
- [ Saroyan ] The circus.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.470
The circus.
The circus.

03:52.024 --> 03:55.812
“Abracadabra”
was first uttered
to cure hay fever.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.322
Conjoined twins
wrapped in a sheet?

04:01.409 --> 04:03.320
Yep.
According
to Hodgins.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.322
It would help to know
how they were wrapped.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.119
All the evidence
is gone with the wind.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.117
- No other clothing?
- According to Hodgins.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.824
The murderer didn ’t want anyone
to identiﬁ/ them from their clothes.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.830
They’re conjoined twins.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.709
You might as well have buried them
with their driver’s licenses in their hands.

04:17.800 --> 04:22.089
Wrapped naked bodies often
indicate a careful burial
or, of course, sexual assault.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.046
Okay, you know what?
That’s, uh— That’s creepy.
We gotta get going, Sweets.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.138
Where?
Texas. That’s
where the circus is.

04:27.226 --> 04:31.469
Uh, circus folk are extremely
tight-lipped and close-knit.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.555
They won’t tell you anything.

04:33.649 --> 04:38.439
- How do you know?
- |— You know, I’ve read articles.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.111
You’re the worst liar
I have ever met.
You read articles?

04:41.198 --> 04:44.031
- Even I know he’s lying.
- Okay. I’m adopted.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.109
You know— You know what?
My story isn’t important here.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.410
No, it’s very important.
(30 ahead.

04:48.497 --> 04:52.115
|— [ Splutters]
When I reached the age of majority,

04:52.209 --> 04:54.791
I tried to find my birth mother—

04:54.879 --> 04:59.543
a psychic who worked
the circus-and-carnival circuit in Florida.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.125
- Bio mom was a carny.
- You know what?
Let’s stay on track.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.506
The point is,
no one would talk to me.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.971
And they won’t open up
to you either. I’m just
trying to be helpful here.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.017
I suspect Sweets is right.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.437
I studied a carnival
for six weeks...

05:15.524 --> 05:18.140
as research for my cultural
anthropology dissertation.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.226
No one would
tell me anything,

05:20.321 --> 05:22.482
even though I became
quite adept on the high wire.

05:22.573 --> 05:26.532
Fine. Ifthey’re gonna talk to their own,
we will go undercover.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.235
- What?
- Ifwe’rejoining a circus, we’ll need an act.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.946
- I’m quite adept on the high wire.
- No, no, no. You know what?

05:32.041 --> 05:34.282
- We’ll have a knife-throwin g act.
- Well, I can’t throw knives.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.958
I can. I had the best
knife skills in the Rangers.

05:37.046 --> 05:40.288
Are we going tojoin the circus?

05:40.382 --> 05:43.044
We are gonna join the circus.

06:18.671 --> 06:22.630
We’re gonna talk to the twms’
mother here in Fort Worth,
then pick up our mobile home.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.966
And we’ll join the circus
right outside Waco.
Uh, our mobile home?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.044
Yeah. We’re circus folks, Bones.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.005
We crisscross the country
in a mobile home.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.557
I had the field office here
paint up something special for us.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.636
Is that all you need to get a job
at the circus— a mobile home?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.689
You know what? It’s gonna help.
It’s showy. And we’re show people.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.563
It’s always possible that we’ll
talk to the girls’ mother...

06:43.654 --> 06:45.940
and solve this whole case tonight.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.109
Right?
I hope not.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.824
What? Huh?
Hmm?

06:59.003 --> 07:02.587
[ Woman] / shou/d’ve never let
those girls /ea ve this home.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.709
Worst thing that can happen
to a mother, isn’t it?

07:04.800 --> 07:09.510
Finding out that you
outlived your child.
Unnatural.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.838
Except for societies
with high infant
mortality rates.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.174
My understanding is you
tried to sue the circus
several times, Mrs. l/an Owen.

07:15.269 --> 07:19.683
- It’s Mrs. Hicks.
- Dell Hicks here is
my husband and my lawyer.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.105
Dell helped me sue
the circus for—

07:22.192 --> 07:24.604
Loss of income,
alienation of affection,

07:24.695 --> 07:28.734
civil rights abuses,
an/ma/ abuses,
Improper h/r/ng,

07:28.824 --> 07:30.815
emotional distress,
mental anguish.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.197
- Any ofthese go to court?
- It’sjust a matter oftime, Agent Booth.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.324
Hmm. You really hated that circus.

07:36.415 --> 07:40.658
They stole my daughters.
I’ll do anything
to get back at them for that.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.916
- When d/d you last see
your daughters?
- Four months ago.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.998
- They told us to butt out
oftheir lives.
-jenny did.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.083
Ifone ofthe girls
wanted something,

07:49.178 --> 07:51.464
it was the same
as both of’em wanting it.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.637
Ifjenny wanted something,
then they both wanted it.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.511
Didn’t matter whatjulie wanted.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.763
/ took a look at the remains,

07:58.854 --> 08:03.143
and I had to wonder ifyou ever considered
having them surgically separated.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.360
It was too dangerous.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.527
- I disagree.
- So didjenny and Dr. Muir.

08:08.614 --> 08:12.732
Wel|,julie and I thought
it was too dangerous.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.785
Your daughters disagreed
on whether or not they
should be separated?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.622
Dr. Muir’s office—
herein Forth Worth?

08:22.544 --> 08:27.083
I’m sure you understand that
my responses to your questions
about the Van Owen sisters...

08:27.174 --> 08:29.540
is somewhat tempered
by patient privilege.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.546
They’re murder victims, right?

08:31.637 --> 08:33.548
Patient privilege no longer applies.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.756
Well, yes, of course.
[Chuckles]

08:36.850 --> 08:39.762
I’ve never— I’ve never had
a patient murdered before.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.471
You thought that the twins
could safeb/ be separated?

08:43.565 --> 08:45.521
- Yes.
- I agree.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.693
As didjenny. Butjulie
and her mother disagreed.

08:49.780 --> 08:54.274
She and her... ambulance-chaser
husband tried to sue me.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.484
- So how did you leave things?
- Well, in the end,

08:56.578 --> 08:58.955
it didn’t matter
what the rest of us thought.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.416
Julie andjenny were gonna
have to come to an agreement.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.287
I wonder ifthey thought
they could continue...

09:04.378 --> 09:06.710
to work in the circus
ifthe y were separated

09:06.797 --> 09:09.163
Well, they both loved the circus.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.169
Yeah,jenny told me once...

09:11.260 --> 09:14.673
that they had some ideas
on how to expand their act.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.847
Sounds likejenny was the bossy one
and Julie was a little nicer?

09:18.934 --> 09:22.222
Well, they were like
any other sisters.

09:22.312 --> 09:26.351
They had distinct
personalities and strengths.

09:26.442 --> 09:29.730
/f there ’s anything else
/can do to help the /-'.B./.—

09:29.820 --> 09:31.310

in Washington.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.780
- Why can’t you simply
take them with you?
- We have another appointment.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.649
Thankyou
for your cooperation.
[Booth] Mm-hmm.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.075
[ Brennan, Affecting Accent]
The FBI. did a wonderfuljob
with this trailer.

Okay.]ust lose the
Katharine Hepburn voice.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.789
I’mjust trying
to find my character.
You know, acting.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.672
Well, don’t. It sounds ridiculous.
Okay, Bones?

09:55.804 --> 09:57.795
[ Door Squeaks]
[Booth]
What’s my name there, Wanda?

09:57.890 --> 10:00.097
It’s written right there
on the side ofthe truck,

10:00.184 --> 10:02.220
which “high wire” is not.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.767
It’sjust sometimes
you get irritated...

10:03.854 --> 10:05.310
and you say “Booth”
without thinking.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.639
[Hepburn Voice]
I don’t do anything
without thinking— ever, Buck.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.522

We’ve worked the Pacific
Northwest, Canada, Alaska.

10:22.748 --> 10:25.160
I guess that makes you
the beautiful assistant then?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.662
Wanda. Yes.
I’m also quite adept
on the high wire.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.462
Well, I gotta admit it would be nice
to have a knife-throwing act around.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.584
Yeah, well, folks,
they love a little danger.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.257
- So what’s your thing?
- Ourthing?

10:36.345 --> 10:39.929
Yeah. Your gimmick. You know,
a cowboy and Indian princess.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.597
A pirate and kidnapped princess.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.266

10:45.354 --> 10:48.141
- We’re Russian.
- Or the “cowboy and Indian princess” thing.

10:48.232 --> 10:50.598
No, no, no.
The Russian thing sounds good

10:50.734 --> 10:52.099
It does?
Yeah.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.067
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
We are “Ruska.”
All right.

is “the first of May?”
[Sweets On Speaker] A newbie.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.506
A rookie.

11:58.594 --> 12:01.336
Why would a little person
be referred to as a 24-hour man?

I could e-mail you a lexicon.

Well, that’s why
we called you, Sweets.

Oh. Good idea.
Okay.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.961
Okay, well, I think
what we need to do is get
a syncopated rhythm going...

12:39.051 --> 12:42.214
that takes advantage
ofthe natural frequency
ofthe springs.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.296
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you this spontaneous

- Well, you know what?

14:00.382 --> 14:04.125

in here somewhere
from ’em that they left.

We loved working here.
And we love all ofyou.

- Well, maybe they were
forced to leave under duress.

a photograph ofthe note

How long will it take you
to analyze it?

I found something
pretty interesting
just by looking at it.

- You saidjenny was
the left-handed twin.
- Yes.

16:10.846 --> 16:14.304
Correct. The smudges and the slants
on the letter indicate...

16:14.391 --> 16:17.758
that the note was written
by the left-handed twin.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.471

with the left hand alone.

Well, the psychiatric term
for fear of clowns
is coulrophobia.

-Indeed.

kill the twins?

Well, because the wounds are
absolutely symmetrical here.

- Magnum. Look.
- [Grunts]

34:35.407 --> 34:36.988
3U [l oud Whistle]
- [Cheering]

34:38.953 --> 34:42.070
He definitely has the upper-body strength
to swing a foam barbell...

34:42.164 --> 34:44.405
hard enough to cause
those fractures.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.866
[ Ringmaster]
Check out those arms of steel!

34:49.213 --> 34:53.422
- Hey there, b/g guy.
You got a m/nute?
- [Spits] For what?

34:53.509 --> 34:57.047
I want to ask you a question
about my friends,Julie and Jenny.

34:57.137 --> 35:00.595
Look, this is getting old.
Now, I told you.

35:00.683 --> 35:04.346
They were here. They left.
That’s all I know. Check
with some other circuses maybe.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.428
- They’re dead.
But you knew that, didn’t you?
- [Scoffs] Dead?

35:07.523 --> 35:11.983
- What are you talking about?
- Their heads were smashed
together, weren’t they?

35:14.488 --> 35:16.900
[ Grunting]

35:16.991 --> 35:19.152
Oh!
Oh! Geez.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.322
That guy is strong.
Well, he is called
a “strong man.”

35:22.454 --> 35:25.787
Well, help me
get out of this.
I’m trying to get out.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.077
[Booth] look, / want to put
a BOl O on this guy r/ght away

35:32.172 --> 35:36.290
Magnum the Strong Man.
Real name— Norman von Gluck.

35:36.385 --> 35:39.422
Well, of course he’s big.
He’s a strong man.

35:39.513 --> 35:41.469
Look, he’s wearing a tank top
that says “Magnum.”

35:41.557 --> 35:43.548
He shouldn’t
be too hard to spot.
[Beeps]

35:43.642 --> 35:46.884
Mr. Nigel-Murray has found
some additional bone anomalies.

35:47.021 --> 35:50.889
[Brennan] C an you explain?
“Anomaly,”
from the Greek anoma/os.

35:50.983 --> 35:54.100
I’m thinking we could move
this along a bit faster,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.857
[Exhales]
I found slight
longitudinal fractures...

35:57.948 --> 36:01.111
along the distal ends
ofall four lower leg bones...

36:01.201 --> 36:03.157
and stress fractures
on the cuboids.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.952
Fractures to
the lower legs and feet.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.873
Does the guy torture ’em first?
Rubber hose to the feet?

36:08.959 --> 36:12.292
That wou/dn ’t be consistent with
the injuries which are isolated
to those speciﬁc areas.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.290
[Brennan]
C an you send me
the X-rays?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.414
The X-rays are—
They’re on their way.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.419
I was more than capable
oftelling herthat.

36:18.510 --> 36:21.377
I was afraid you’d start talking
about Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen...

36:21.472 --> 36:23.087
and the discovery
ofthe X-ray.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.595
November the 8th, 1895.
He made an image
of his wife’s hand—

36:26.685 --> 36:30.303
I rest my case.
By the way,
we all loved your show.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.558
Oh, thank you.
Did you hear the cheering?

36:32.649 --> 36:35.186
- Eh, it was all for me.
- Booth was undeniably good.

36:35.277 --> 36:38.360
However, he’s not
very imaginative
as far as the act goes.

36:38.447 --> 36:42.406
look, there is a diﬁ’erence between
Imagination and tempting late.

36:42.493 --> 36:44.700
I amjust asking
for a little flair.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.778
Flair?
You want flair—

36:46.872 --> 36:49.534
- Can I ask about the eye?
- No.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.367
/ was thinking that
/ could wear a hat of ﬁuit,

36:52.461 --> 36:55.043
and then you could slice
through each fruit while—

36:55.130 --> 36:57.712
Bones, it’s over.
No more undercover.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.758
The act, it’s over.

37:03.806 --> 37:07.970
We have to go question
the other performers.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.051
Right.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.846
Hey.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.182
You two want to explain
what happened
with Magnum?

37:16.318 --> 37:18.434
[Brennan]
He trapped us in the net.
For no reason?

37:18.529 --> 37:20.611
- We asked him
about the twins.
- Asked what?

37:20.697 --> 37:23.154
If he knew anything
about how they died

37:26.495 --> 37:28.781
[Clown] You want us
to take care of this?
Settle.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.496
Who are you people?
F.B.I. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.075
And Dr. Temperance Brennan
of the jeffersonian Institution.

37:35.170 --> 37:37.161
Okay, uh, the Van Owen twins
were murdered.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.417
Our prime suspect
right now is Magnum.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.544
He had the requisite strength.

37:41.635 --> 37:45.799
- Magnum never killed anyone.
- People, can you
please come back now?

37:45.931 --> 37:48.092
Tell them to come back.
None of us
are gonna help you.

37:48.183 --> 37:52.222
- Don’t you care
what happened to the twins?
- You aren’t one of us.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.554
You don’t get it, do you?
How could you? You’re gillies.

37:55.649 --> 37:58.857
No. No. We’re not gillies.
Our act was good.

37:58.944 --> 38:01.686
Yeah. You’re gillies.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.239
Right.
[Sighs]
We have no case.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.237
Yeah. We will
when we bring Magnum in.

38:08.328 --> 38:12.162
We have no definitive forensics
tying him or anyone else
to the murder.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.740
You will when you
get back to the lab.
You’ll find evidence.

38:14.835 --> 38:18.703
The “boneus maximus”
will have his initials
on it or something.

38:20.924 --> 38:24.837
/ really was pretty good
on the high wire.

38:25.971 --> 38:29.429
I’m gonna try it.
No— Up there? Now?

38:29.516 --> 38:32.303
Wait a second. Bones, no.
You will— You’ll fall.
It’s too high.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.602
- There’s a net.
- You got no depth perception.
You have a patch on your eye.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.022
- You won’t be able to see.
- No. It’s more a case of feel.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.521
- I could do it with my eyes shut.
- You shut your eyes,

38:41.612 --> 38:43.603
and I will shut mine,
’cause I am not watching.

38:43.697 --> 38:46.359
My teacher said I was
one of his best students.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.784
This is crazy.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.451
- Booth, look!
- No.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.253
I told you.
I’m not gonna look.
I’m keeping my eyes shut.

39:02.341 --> 39:05.424
This is absolutely—
Oh, my God.

39:05.511 --> 39:08.753
Bones. Whoo!
Wo w! You are fearless.

39:10.641 --> 39:12.632
My feet.
I’m not in shape forthis.

39:12.726 --> 39:14.933
look at you.
You’re doing great.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.261
You think maybe you
could ride a bike
on that thing...

39:17.356 --> 39:19.642
and maybe spin
a ball on your nose
at the same time?

39:19.733 --> 39:21.894
- Ow! My cuboids.
- Your what?

39:21.985 --> 39:25.773
- The cuboids are the bones in my feet.
- Bones, you all right?

39:27.199 --> 39:30.908
- Bones.
- Yeah, I’m fine.

39:31.036 --> 39:33.368
[Shouts]
Oh, my God!

39:33.497 --> 39:36.455
[ Pa nti n g ]
Bones,
are you all right?

39:36.542 --> 39:39.909
Yeah, I’m ﬁne.
[ Gasps ]
/ know what happened

39:40.003 --> 39:43.336
- It’s pretty obvious.
You lost your balance.
- No. To the twins.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.914
They weren’t murdered.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.876
The stress fractures
to their ﬁbu/as
and cuboids?

39:48.971 --> 39:51.428
They were caused by walking
on the high wire.

39:51.515 --> 39:53.847
And-And the kissing fracture?

39:53.934 --> 39:56.220
Their heads snapped together
when they fell into the net.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.302
That’s why there
was no other trauma.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.979
Oh. A conjoined twin
high wire act.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.603
Henry said thatJenny
wanted to be famous.

40:03.694 --> 40:06.185
Their act would’ve been
completely unique.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.525
[Brennan]
Well, that’s a ﬁrst.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.611
Yeah. He covered up
an accident by making it
look like a murder.

40:15.706 --> 40:18.413
[Magnum]
/ drdn ’t kill ’em.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.661
I didn’t kill ’em.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.581
I loved them.

40:23.714 --> 40:26.171
I would never
hurt them.
We know.

40:26.258 --> 40:30.001
/buried them,
and they needed a proper burial

40:31.763 --> 40:33.879
Don’t say anything,
Magnum.

40:33.974 --> 40:37.307
You asked them not to go on
the h/gh wire, but that’s exactly
what they wanted to do.

40:37.394 --> 40:40.056
It’s probably the only thing
Julie and Jenny ever agreed on.

40:40.147 --> 40:43.890
When they dropped to the net,
the force ofthe fall
snapped their heads together.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.942
An accident like that,
their moth er deﬁnite/y
would’ve sued

40:47.029 --> 40:49.020
The circus
would never have survived.

40:50.699 --> 40:53.862
I’m gonna have to arrest you
for interference with a dead body.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.285
- We’re sorry. Aren’t we?
- Yeah.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.660
- Sorry.
- We’re going to get you
a good lawyer.

41:00.751 --> 41:03.117
Just don’t bring them
into this.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.578
’Cause I don’t wanna see
the circus die
because of me.

41:06.673 --> 41:09.164
What you ’re gonna
have to explain is why
you wrapped ’em In a sheet,

41:09.259 --> 41:12.717
because that’s
something a woman
would do out of respect.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.843
You’ll also have to explain
how you forged their
handwriting on a note.

41:19.353 --> 41:22.390
Yeah. I will.

41:23.732 --> 41:25.438
Thanks.

41:32.074 --> 41:36.408
Well, / ’l/yust call up
the Dallas ﬁeld office
and have them pick him up.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.531
Think he ’l/ run again?

41:40.582 --> 41:42.322

No. He won ’t run.

Yeah. Yeah.

“Boris and Natasha and Their
Russian Knives of Death.”

42:28.839 --> 42:30.830
I guess we all
got it in us, huh?

42:30.924 --> 42:33.961
The desire to run off
andjoin the circus.

42:36.471 --> 42:39.634
- We did it.
- Buck and Wanda were damn good.

42:39.725 --> 42:43.138
Buck was more dashing
than you. I mean,
Buck drove a motorcycle.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.719
- Well, Wanda
was funner than you.
- How?

42:45.814 --> 42:48.681
She let me knock off
a rubber nose from her face
with a knife.

42:48.775 --> 42:52.267
You would never
let me do that.
You are way too rational
