WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.676
Okay, Aaron's on his way to Chad's
to play poker.

00:09.759 --> 00:14.514
My Postmate is on his way to Sandwich Hell
to pick up my Monte Anti-Cristo,

00:14.597 --> 00:18.101
and Mommy's on her way
to having the best night of her life.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.437
I cannot wait to watch that--

00:20.520 --> 00:23.857
Sorry, TV and a sandwich
is the best night of your life?

00:23.940 --> 00:25.108
What's rock bottom?

00:25.191 --> 00:26.693
Not just any TV.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.112
It's that new Korean show
everyone's talking about.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.406
<i>Trout Royale? </i>Oh, so good.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.826
Who knew there are so many items
in an orchestra to strangle someone with?

00:34.909 --> 00:36.911
No. No spoilers.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.997
I avoided social media for a week

00:39.080 --> 00:43.043
just so I can binge the whole thing
once I got the house to myself.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.588
Sometimes you just need to kick back
from the nagging husband.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.714
Am I right, Con?

00:47.797 --> 00:48.631
Totally.

00:48.715 --> 00:53.219
I tried doing a Solo Sunday once a month,
but just ended up inviting Raul.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.307
Kind of funny that you moved back in
with Aaron less than a month ago

00:57.390 --> 00:58.725
and you need a break.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.437
Yeah, it's hilarious.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.356
Hey, Con, we got any copies
of <i>Stand and Deliver?</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:09.069
This guy is subbing for Mrs. Hollinger,
who was my eighth grade math teacher.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.488
She's taking her first day off
in 20 years.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.157
She got arrested,
but I'm glad she's getting a breather.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.285
<i>Stand and Deliver,</i>
three copies, Latin Classics.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.620
Nope, all rented out.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.373
Why is <i>Scarface</i> here?
Pacino is doing full-on Cuban face.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.958
It says we have three.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.086
How about <i>Freedom Writers</i>
or <i>The Blind Side?</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:27.170
I don't want to--

01:27.253 --> 01:30.590
-Teach. We went to public school.
-White Savior section.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.425
Weird, none of those are here.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.886
Forget it, I'll just show them<i> Titanic</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:36.387
and skip over the boobs.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.389
Or not. Who cares?

01:38.473 --> 01:41.059
You really gotta
stop putting off inventory.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.144
I opened a <i>La La Land</i> case

01:43.228 --> 01:45.271
and there was just
a loose piece of deli meat.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.190
Arguably an improvement, but...

01:47.273 --> 01:48.108
You know what?

01:48.191 --> 01:51.486
Eliza's right, gang,
we're doing inventory tonight.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.612
Oh, come on.

01:52.695 --> 01:53.780
Thanks, narc.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.781
Fun.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.199
Sorry, but think about

01:56.282 --> 01:59.536
how much longer everything takes
searching for missing DVDs.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.956
Geez, your mom finally learned to text?

02:03.039 --> 02:05.917
No, she's into annoying calls
without warning.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.545
These are all women from the bar.
We're in a group chat.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.464
I feel like I'm being forced
into a sister wives situation.

02:11.548 --> 02:15.176
Wow. Guess you left quite the impression.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.887
Just promise me you won't have 18 kids.

02:17.971 --> 02:22.559
Well, guys, if you'll excuse me,
I am trout-a here.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.726
I'm stealing that.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.729
Whoa, inventory will take all of us.
Even you, Eliza.

02:26.813 --> 02:31.192
But I'm not on the schedule
and <i>Trout Royale...</i>

02:31.276 --> 02:32.277
Oh, masterpiece.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.236
So good.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.612
It's been out for six days.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.532
If I could go back in time
and tell 5-year-old me

02:37.615 --> 02:40.577
the biggest shows and bands
in the world are gonna be Korean,

02:40.660 --> 02:44.038
he'd be like, "Whoa, time travel exists?
How do we die?"

02:44.122 --> 02:47.542
I die in Guy Fieri's
Times Square restaurant. Mm!

02:47.625 --> 02:51.713
Yeah. Well, you're totally right, Eliza,
you are not on the schedule.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.047
It is up to you

02:53.131 --> 02:56.467
if you want to suggest
a bunch of work for the rest of us

02:56.551 --> 02:58.219
then go home and watch TV.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.641
Damn it.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.238
-Hey, babe, I'm still at work.
-<i>Hey.</i>

03:17.322 --> 03:19.782
-What's up?
-<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:22.327
-<i>I miss you, Goose.</i>
-Oh, yeah? Thanks.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.244
Anything else?

03:23.328 --> 03:26.331
<i>What if I came home from poker night early</i>

03:26.414 --> 03:28.249
<i>so we can cuddle up to some </i>Yellowstone?

03:28.333 --> 03:31.169
-Early? No, no, no.
-<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:36.466
Come on, babe. This is your night.
You never get to see the boys anymore.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.092
Honestly, stay out later,

03:38.176 --> 03:42.430
you know, poker, strip club,
eat a heat lamp buffalo wing.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.807
<i>I do love those. </i>

03:44.891 --> 03:47.143
I don't understand the difference.

03:47.227 --> 03:51.689
<i>The Room</i> is a drama that is funny,
and<i> Room</i> is a drama that's traumatic.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.066
Very different films.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.193
"You're tearing me apart, Lisa."

03:55.276 --> 03:57.195
"Ah! I'm kidnapped in a basement."

03:57.278 --> 03:59.989
Oh, so one of them
has "The" in front of it.

04:00.073 --> 04:00.907
Makes sense.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.326
This is so fun, like a sleepover.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.494
That's the spirit.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.373
We'll stay up late, play Truth or Dare,
someone will end up dead,

04:08.456 --> 04:10.416
our terrible secret will bond us.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.376
We'll eat Doritos.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.211
No. Not the spirit.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.755
Isn't your big accounting final tomorrow?

04:15.838 --> 04:17.715
Tell Timmy to let you go study.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.134
-Everyone's accounting on you.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.637
I should credit the Popsicle stick
I read that on.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.554
It's fine.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.558
I never study and I always get a B,
I'm weirdly good at accounting.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.602
That was the saddest thing
I've ever said.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.231
Saddest thing I've ever said
is "One ticket for <i>Space Jam 2."</i>

04:33.314 --> 04:36.317
Aw... Look at the family working together.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.779
You're making me a very proud
Blockbuster daddy right now.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.616
How about we turn this inventory party
into an inventory pizza party.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.868
-I'm buying. What do people want?
-Overtime pay.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.246
Extra pepperoni will do.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.540
-Okay.
-Gang, little less talky-talky,

04:50.623 --> 04:52.917
little more restocky-stocky. Yes?

04:53.001 --> 04:56.045
-I just got off with Aaron--
-How's his boys' night?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.130
So great.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.466
There's a chance he comes home early,
which I love, by the way,

05:00.550 --> 05:03.720
so we need to make inventory happen now.

05:03.803 --> 05:08.057
If we're done by 11:00, that gives me
three hours to finish <i>Trout Royale.</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:11.227
-I don't think that's enough time.
-It is at one-and-a-half speed.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.729
You were what ruined cinema.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.273
Don't worry, at this rate,
you'll get home by 9:00.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.026
You'll get your "you" time.
We need to stick together.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.193
-Ooh.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.197
<i>You're not gonna believe</i>
<i>what your father did.</i>

05:23.281 --> 05:24.949
Umma, what's wrong?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.367
My mom needs me.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.244
Again? What is it now?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.165
Does she need you to pick out a hat color
or carry her golf clubs?

05:32.248 --> 05:33.333
Those are errands.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.128
She said "emergency." There's a reason
the word's the same in every language.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.339
Okay. That's for sure not true.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.257
Why can't she ask your dad?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.802
Isn't that a perk of living at the same
retirement resort as your ex-husband?

05:44.886 --> 05:47.597
I don't understand
how that was a good idea.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.974
My parents have
a complicated relationship.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.309
-That's normal.
-Sure.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.187
It's totally normal
to call your adult son over

05:54.270 --> 05:57.315
to mediate a custody schedule
for a golf instructor.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.900
Fine. So, I'm a good son.

05:58.983 --> 06:02.862
They're always dragging you over there
to referee their fights.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.031
Doesn't your mom
have anyone else she can call?

06:05.114 --> 06:06.491
My mom's a required taste.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.451
-You mean "acquired taste."
-No, required.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.787
As in I'm required to help her
whenever she calls.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.456
Come on, man, we've talked about this.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.918
You're absolutely right, but I gotta go.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.462
Okay, fine. Just hurry.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.798
Without you, this will take all night.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.843
Okay, but if you really need me back,
let me borrow your car.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.596
I have one star on Uber.
They're not coming.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.764
Fine.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.141
Not that I have a phobia,

06:32.225 --> 06:34.977
but you're not gonna give rides
to any old people, are you?

06:35.061 --> 06:38.398
No. I mean, I don't know. But no promises.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.111
-Timmy, take off the emergency brake.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.534
So I take it this is not a real emergency?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.120
Eliza was right.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.455
It's an emotional emergency. Wait.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.792
Eliza, Eliza?
The one you used to like in high school?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.128
So she's finally decided to date you?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.296
It only took 20 years.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.756
We are not dating.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.633
I'm over her. Way over.

07:05.716 --> 07:10.138
She's married, or sort of married,
and it doesn't matter because I'm dating.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.472
Three women I met at a bar

07:11.556 --> 07:14.350
who all communicate
exclusively in low-res GIFs.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.643
I'm doing very well.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.186
Sounds more like a cry for help.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.981
Will you tell me the problem
so I can get back to work?

07:20.064 --> 07:22.275
Your <i>abeoji</i> is at his scams again.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.609
It's not a scam.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.612
I'm just telling the nurse I have diabetes

07:26.696 --> 07:29.699
so I can get diabetic ice cream
instead of prunes.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.160
Then you sell it to the other residents.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.369
That's a scam.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.164
It's a business,
but your mother ratted me out.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.499
So yet another revenue stream
destroyed by her.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.543
Appa, can you just say I'm sorry?

07:41.043 --> 07:43.337
Wait, what's up with the wheelchair?

07:44.172 --> 07:45.548
I am unable to walk.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.507
Unwilling.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.594
The years of emotional duress
your father caused me

07:49.677 --> 07:51.721
has finally affected my legs.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.474
-Maybe he should say sorry for that too.
-Fat chance.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.017
It says "Sheila" on it.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.562
It's mine. And, besides,
I need it more than she does.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.397
How about a movie night?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.275
That used to take your minds off
how much you hate each other.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.153
And I happen to have a copy of <i>Lilo and...</i>

08:07.904 --> 08:08.738
<i>Saw III.</i>

08:08.821 --> 08:11.449
We're doing inventory,
we're doing inventory.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.785
<i>Saw III</i> is the best of the franchise,

08:14.869 --> 08:16.829
created by an Asian brother.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.414
Everyone knows that.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.499
No way you knew.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.043
-I will punch you, old man.
-Give me your best shot.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.462
I should've married Dennis.
He was the one for me.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.590
Go ahead. Let's see what
you can do. You know, you--

08:27.673 --> 08:31.093
-Excuse me. Are you Sheila?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.680
-Ooh.

08:35.473 --> 08:39.393
Okay, so just log the inventory
directly into the computer.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.645
It should be Timmy's job,

08:40.728 --> 08:42.813
but he's too busy
crawling back into the womb.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.150
We don't need Timmy.
I've done this a million times.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.529
It's the first time I've done it
after the witching hour.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.156
-It's like 7:00.
-Exactly.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.826
I'm usually asleep in front of the TV
having a nightmare about James Corden.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.995
Don't let the accent fool you.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.373
He's a bully and a menace.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.709
There'll be plenty of time for your
<i>Carpool Karaoke</i> night terrors later.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.336
Now, we need your skills.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.712
Aye-aye, captain.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.799
In certain lights,
you look like Captain Kirk.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.682
-What's wrong with Connie?
-Her favorite restaurant is Souplantation,

09:17.765 --> 09:20.309
she keeps asking when
"Mambo Number Six" is coming out--

09:20.393 --> 09:22.186
No, I mean, she's half-asleep.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.063
Oh! She never stays up this late.

09:24.146 --> 09:27.149
Calls herself a day owl,
and I don't have the heart to correct her.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.569
This is supposed to be my "me" time.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.612
I should be on my couch cuddling my cat,

09:31.696 --> 09:35.408
a bag of Sour Smurfs
and Target's finest Merlot.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.076
Is this what <i>Cathy</i> is?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.121
No, that comic strip lady
is doing surprisingly better.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.295
<i>Hola, Papá.</i>

09:47.378 --> 09:50.798
Hola, mijo!<i> We wanted to send you</i>
<i>good luck on your final.</i>

09:50.881 --> 09:53.175
<i>-How's the studying?</i>
-Great. I've studied non-stop.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.679
I know all my numbers
in English and in Spanish.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.557
Corazón,<i> go get ready for work.</i>

09:59.640 --> 10:01.851
<i>-You're going to be late.</i>
<i>-Come, look.</i>

10:01.934 --> 10:05.104
<i>Oh, </i>mijo,<i> how are you doing?</i>

10:05.187 --> 10:07.273
Cómo estás?<i> Are you eating?</i>

10:07.356 --> 10:10.693
I'm eat-- It's late.
Why is Dad leaving for work now?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.737
<i>Don't worry, I picked up night shifts.</i>

10:12.820 --> 10:16.032
<i>We are so proud of you.</i>
<i>You'll be an accountant in no time.</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:18.242
I gotta go study. <i>Te amo.</i>

10:18.326 --> 10:19.327
-<i>Bye.</i>
-Bye.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.244
Bye, bye.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.001
Where are you going? Connie's fading fast.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.171
-I need you on the computer.
-Sorry, I need to study.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.757
I'm never gonna<i> Trout Royale.</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:36.802
Will no one sacrifice
for my greater good?

10:36.886 --> 10:39.930
You sure you haven't seen it?
That's their tagline.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.144
<i>The game is death...</i>

10:45.227 --> 10:47.647
All right, some p-corn for my umma,

10:47.730 --> 10:51.150
your favorite, num, num, yum,
and good vintage.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.361
You guys good?

10:53.444 --> 10:55.404
-Yes, we're fine.
-Yeah, thanks.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.282
<i>Now your turn to choose...</i>

11:00.576 --> 11:02.703
Where is everyone?

11:02.787 --> 11:05.498
I can't do inventory by myself, people.

11:05.581 --> 11:09.293
You'll all feel bad when they find my body
under an avalanche of <i>Wedding Crashers.</i>

11:09.377 --> 11:10.461
I'm here. Let me help.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.921
-Actually, Hannah.
-No--

11:12.004 --> 11:14.423
-Not what I meant.
-Don't worry, I--

11:16.133 --> 11:17.635
I just alphabetized those!

11:17.718 --> 11:19.762
Made peace for my parents,
chugged an Ensure,

11:19.845 --> 11:21.639
now I am jacked for inventory.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.432
-Let's do this.
-Took you long enough.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.601
-Where are we?
-Connie's acting extra weird,

11:25.685 --> 11:27.645
Carlos is studying,
Hannah's doing the thing

11:27.728 --> 11:29.897
where she tries to help
but makes things worse.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.441
So we're right where we were
when you abandoned us.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.610
Only, you're a lot meaner.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.779
I'm not mean. I'm hungry.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.573
Oh, the pizza.
I totally forgot. That's on me.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.201
I'll input these numbers while I order.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.287
That is multitasking. Plus garlic knots?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.498
And cheesy bread.
It's the least you can do.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.834
I should be bra-less
reading subtitles right now.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.044
I will get you home soon. I promise.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.885
Every DVD tells a story.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.307
What?

12:05.391 --> 12:09.186
<i>Good evening. I'm Regina Rosenchurch</i>
<i>filling in for Floy Beckam,</i>

12:09.270 --> 12:10.438
<i>who is on vacation.</i>

12:10.521 --> 12:13.524
<i>Scientists are warning</i>
<i>that an upcoming solar storm</i>

12:13.607 --> 12:16.610
<i>could result in a blackout</i>
<i>for the entire Midwest.</i>

12:16.694 --> 12:17.903
<i>Today's top story...</i>

12:17.987 --> 12:19.989
I thought you
weren't worried about the exam.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.324
If accounting is what I'll do
for the rest of my life,

12:22.408 --> 12:23.659
I should try harder.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.120
No immigrant parents
have ever been proud of a B.

12:26.203 --> 12:30.624
I love B's, they're home school A-pluses.
Sure you can't take a short break?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.377
A customer's deciding between two movies
Connie hasn't seen

12:33.461 --> 12:36.630
and she's making up what they're about
based on the title.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.215
I can't. I have to study.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.258
You sure?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.218
One is <i>Michael Clayton.</i>

12:42.094 --> 12:45.014
...and that's where
the Clayton part comes in.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.225
Okay.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.102
Yes, two large pizzas--

12:50.186 --> 12:53.439
I'm sorry, venti pizzas and garlic knots--

12:53.522 --> 12:55.649
-Hold on, I'm getting another call.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.530
Appa, what's up?

13:04.241 --> 13:06.035
Okay there, Eliza girl.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.663
Call me Beau Bridges
because I am making beaucoup progress.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.917
-Okay.
-Yeah, about to grab some DVDs to log.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.503
Call me Kenny Loggins
because I am loggin'.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.504
What's going on?

13:16.587 --> 13:18.923
Marvin Gaye's greatest album, I concur.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.887
No! No! Timmy! Timmy!

13:25.888 --> 13:26.722
Grow up!

13:26.806 --> 13:28.390
Your parents are manipulating you!

13:28.474 --> 13:33.020
I know because I do it to my own kid,
but in my case it's for her own good!

13:38.275 --> 13:39.109
Great idea.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.655
Get frosty because it looks like
you and I are carrying this-- No!

13:42.738 --> 13:45.574
Are you a 4-year-old
in a paper towel commercial?

13:48.118 --> 13:51.288
Connie! Connie. Connie!

13:51.372 --> 13:52.456
Are the cops here?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.124
No! Wake up!

13:54.667 --> 13:58.337
You may be slower on a computer
than the DMV sloth in <i>Zootopia,</i>

13:58.420 --> 14:00.130
but you're all I've got!

14:00.756 --> 14:01.757
I'm sorry.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.969
Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me.

14:05.052 --> 14:08.597
I think I just-- Maybe you're right.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.226
Maybe it is weird that I'm trying
to get away from Aaron

14:12.309 --> 14:14.687
when we just got back together.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.355
I should want him around,

14:16.438 --> 14:19.400
but I just can't watch
<i>Trout Royale</i> with him

14:19.483 --> 14:23.821
because he prefers
the terrible English dub to subtitles.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.824
I mean, the man is allergic to reading,

14:26.907 --> 14:29.869
and I just needed one night to myself.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.539
Is that terrible?

14:34.331 --> 14:37.626
Aaron is doing all the right things.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.212
He's finally thinking of me for once.

14:41.797 --> 14:46.677
So why does it feel like
I have a Clydesdale standing on my chest?

14:48.429 --> 14:49.513
Am I a monster?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.100
You're asleep.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.738
Connie, I've got your favorite flavor.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.033
Flat Sprite.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.785
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.001
So good.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.753
What's the emergency now?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.047
Told you he loved me more.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.550
That doesn't prove anything.
Plus you sped up your breathing, cheater.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.594
-That's how I breathe.
-Wow.

15:28.677 --> 15:33.807
So you forced me to abandon my staff again
for what feels like a bet?

15:33.891 --> 15:36.727
No. We wanted to see you.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.104
You're so obsessed with your store.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.775
You know our family works best
when it's the three of us.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.820
I saw you an hour ago
and my store is a real business.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.032
Not like when I was a kid
and opened a restaurant in our basement.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.825
I miss Taco Timmy's.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.744
The people that work there,

15:53.827 --> 15:56.956
who are being more of a family to me now
than you are,

15:57.039 --> 15:58.415
are relying on me.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.335
I wanna be there for them,
they're there for me.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.253
I'm sorry, but I can't be a part of this

16:03.337 --> 16:06.507
horrifying Rube Goldberg
of manipulation anymore.

16:07.132 --> 16:07.967
Ouch.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.554
But... you're my special guy.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.307
Yeah. We like you and stuff.

16:16.058 --> 16:20.062
I love you guys, but I need to
set some boundaries for my own sake.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.313
So here's the deal.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.358
From now on,
you have to get along on your own

16:24.441 --> 16:26.944
and settle your own fights
without my help.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.113
We can do that.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.115
I can try.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.576
I mean, I will.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.494
Good.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.543
And you have to give Sheila
back her wheelchair.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.128
Thank you.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.634
Connie!

16:54.555 --> 16:55.723
What did you do?

16:55.806 --> 16:56.849
What I had to.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.351
I've got two hours until Aaron gets home.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.938
I can watch the first and last episodes
and use context to fill in the middle.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.817
You'll miss the big twist
when they discover one of the trout's--

17:06.900 --> 17:08.569
Ready to do inventory, Con?

17:09.445 --> 17:10.654
Eat my shorts, <i>mija.</i>

17:29.173 --> 17:30.382
That's upsetting.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.026
Oh, let me grab my phone.

17:52.946 --> 17:53.781
Hate that.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.826
Stick to TV, sweetie.

17:58.702 --> 18:03.040
This is the first sighting
of this rare day owl after dark.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.502
Now, filterless,
we see her stalk her prey.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.711
You're bad in that.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.509
Your ex had better taste in movies.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.594
She also was a Japanese sex robot.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.555
Sorry, a Japanese-American sex robot.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.727
Don't know it, don't want to.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.562
-Don't say it.
-Come on.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.398
You love this,
and I know you hate accounting.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.734
My parents just got on board
with the whole bisexual thing.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.486
I can't drop another huge thing.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.780
There should be a holiday
between blindsidings.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.242
I guess, but it's time you could
spend chasing your dream.

18:38.325 --> 18:42.162
When you have immigrant parents,
you don't just chase your dreams.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.164
They have dreams you're supposed to follow

18:44.248 --> 18:46.333
and going to film school isn't one.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.044
Why is no one working?
Do you people even want to go home?

18:49.128 --> 18:52.047
Am I the only one
who values eventually leaving?

18:52.131 --> 18:56.093
Calm down. I'm just trying to get Carlos
to come out as a filmmaker.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.678
What's all the commotion, nerds?

18:57.761 --> 19:00.180
Gotta be honest, love this color on you.

19:00.264 --> 19:04.059
Carlos is afraid to tell his parents
he's the next Michael Bay.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.811
More like Robert Rodriguez.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.480
A lot more, but without the weird hats.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.732
You have to choose
what will make you happy.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.818
You don't wanna end up like Eliza.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.195
-Stuck.
-Stuck?

19:15.279 --> 19:17.197
I'm not stuck. No one is stuck.

19:17.281 --> 19:21.118
The definition of stuck is frozen,
fixed in place, can't be moved.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.037
I never stop making moves.
My life is awesome.

19:24.121 --> 19:28.000
I mean he doesn't want to wake up one day
and realize he's out of options.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.210
Sorry, options he actually likes.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.128
You get it.

19:32.337 --> 19:37.301
Eliza, I'd love to be you,
you have very comfy looking shoes and--

19:37.384 --> 19:41.263
You're great at karaoke.
Connie doesn't know what she's saying.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.306
I'm not stuck.

19:42.973 --> 19:48.061
Okay, I'm just building my résumé
with skills like inventory.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.232
Didn't realize energy drinks
made you a dick.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.319
Hey, turtleneck,
you can also eat my shorts.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.117
Guess who's back.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.077
Yeah, for now.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.037
No, for good.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.789
I told my folks I'm done
jumping through hoops for them,

20:07.873 --> 20:09.124
literally and figuratively.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.085
My mom used to make me
do Westminster Dog Show drills.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.463
Good for you
for finally standing up for yourself.

20:14.546 --> 20:18.175
I couldn't have done it without you
pushing me to be a better leader.

20:18.258 --> 20:23.013
I am not here to push you
or to clean up your messes, Timmy.

20:23.096 --> 20:27.184
This was my one day to relax
without anyone bothering me.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.437
-Some of us have lives, you know.
-I know.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.272
You're totally right.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.984
Which is why I'm sending everyone home,
and I'm gonna finish inventory myself.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.987
I'm really sorry, Eliza.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.118
It's so weird hearing the word "sorry"
coming from a male voice.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.080
13-year-old Timmy thanks you
for saying I have a male voice.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.209
My folks went through their whole marriage

20:52.292 --> 20:53.961
without ever saying sorry.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.797
It's time to break some patterns,

20:56.880 --> 20:59.716
which is why I'm sorry
you didn't get to watch <i>Trout Royale.</i>

20:59.800 --> 21:03.220
It's really good,
but I will make it up to you, I swear.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.389
It's cool. I read the plot summary,

21:05.472 --> 21:08.517
while I was hiding from Connie
in the storage closet.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.022
Did you watch it with the English dub
or the subtitles?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.192
Subtitles. I'm not a monster.
Who'd do that?

21:20.696 --> 21:22.906
I'm sorry I got so mad.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.159
It's my own stuff. See you tomorrow?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.934
<i>Hate that. No, no, no.</i>

21:55.355 --> 21:57.524
<i>Do you think this is a game?</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:10.078
It's really good.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.289
I kind of just threw it together.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.750
You talk about wanting to be a director,

22:14.833 --> 22:17.919
but you're like already a director.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.089
I guess I am.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.924
Thanks.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.636
All right. I think I'm ready
to come out to my parents.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.390
That's my guy.
<i>Carpe diem,</i> seize the minute.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.976
It's "day,"
but I'm not gonna seize it yet.

22:33.060 --> 22:37.314
Come on. Call them and tell them
you want to go to film school.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.648
It's crazy late.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.525
I'm gonna tell them Sunday.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.027
That's when my dad drinks.

22:42.110 --> 22:43.028
Oh, mine too.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.379
I give that marriage until Christmas.

23:03.423 --> 23:04.257
What?

23:04.341 --> 23:06.968
Eliza is a sweet girl.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.304
That cheater doesn't make her happy.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.598
She said so herself.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.103
She said this today?
What else did she say?

23:18.980 --> 23:21.691
They keep Walt Disney's head
under the castle.
