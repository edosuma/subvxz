03:26.720 --> 03:30.440
THICKER THAN WATER

04:25.000 --> 04:26.720
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.440
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, great.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.320
So, how about it?

04:38.800 --> 04:43.120
I think this could be good.
Really bloody good.

04:44.440 --> 04:50.640
The location might not be perfect,
but I think I can make it work.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.360
Come on, Mischa, help me out.
You know you can trust me.

04:58.440 --> 05:01.080
Lasse, Lasse, Lasse...

05:03.000 --> 05:06.760
-I just need some start-up capital.
-No way.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.960
You're dead
in the restaurant business.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.680
But I've got something else.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.480
You've got connections on Åland,
right?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.800
What? What have you got?

05:20.240 --> 05:25.440
-Pure heroine. 30 kilos.
-Jesus Christ, are you insane?

05:25.880 --> 05:27.960
I'm only joking.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.000
What happened
to your sense of humour?

05:32.360 --> 05:37.320
It's nothing bad. Just stuff
that needs to cool off for a bit.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.680
I can't... I can't go back to that.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.480
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.640
You'll come away with 10,000 euros!

05:48.720 --> 05:50.600
That's your start-up capital.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.440
All you have to do is get on the
boat, meet me on the water,

05:55.520 --> 05:57.480
and sit on the goods for a while.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.200
Think about it. We'll talk tomorrow.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.360
Hello?

07:51.120 --> 07:51.960
Oskar?

08:05.720 --> 08:06.920
Oskar?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.240
Liv?

08:14.880 --> 08:15.760
Hello?

08:32.280 --> 08:33.280
Hello?

08:50.560 --> 08:54.320
-Hi, Mischa.
<i>-Have you thought about it?</i>

08:56.080 --> 08:58.680
I said no. I just can't do it.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.880
<i>Lasse, I need you.</i>

09:01.280 --> 09:02.440
<i>Tell you what.</i>

09:02.520 --> 09:06.600
<i>At least go out and check the ice</i>
<i>to see if we can make it ashore.</i>

09:06.680 --> 09:08.160
<i>Can you do that?</i>

09:09.040 --> 09:11.440
-All right. Sure.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

09:11.800 --> 09:15.560
<i>-Get back to me afterwards.</i>
-Talk to you later.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.440
Hello.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.440
You're here early. What...?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.160
What time is it?

10:03.640 --> 10:06.960
I came early to help. Jonna phoned.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.160
Why haven't you picked up?
I phoned and phoned.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.920
I'm not sure where my phone is.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.360
It should be around here somewhere...

10:18.400 --> 10:19.920
Are you all right?

10:24.320 --> 10:26.360
It should be here...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.960
-Hey, what's going on?
-What do you mean?

10:31.840 --> 10:36.360
-What's going on?
-Nothing. It's just... Åland.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.560
I mean the inn. How are we supposed
to get this ready for next week?

10:42.680 --> 10:46.200
Have you ordered anything?
Food, drinks? Is that taken care of?

10:46.280 --> 10:49.320
-Hungry? Want something to eat?
-No.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.040
I shot one of those...
What's it called? A...

10:57.000 --> 11:00.640
What is going on with you?
Where is Liv?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.960
I don't know.
She's on a trip somewhere.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.040
-Still?
-Yeah...

11:08.520 --> 11:10.760
I think she...

11:10.840 --> 11:13.120
She left me, I think.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.520
She's not coming back.
Nobody ever comes back.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.560
We'll get through this. Jonna said
she'd be here as soon as she could.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.560
Why are you hiding out here?

11:43.120 --> 11:46.120
Because it's so uncomfortable
in there.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.520
Don't you think?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.840
I'm afraid I might break something.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.480
-Yeah, I guess it is a bit...
-Pretentious, maybe?

11:55.200 --> 11:56.560
Yeah, it is.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.560
So, Jonna?

12:02.200 --> 12:05.160
You're the bull in the china shop.
It's nice to finally meet you.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.080
I'm Gavin Leonard. I'm the producer.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.240
Oh, my God!

12:31.280 --> 12:33.240
Take care. Bye.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.640
-See you soon. Bye, guys.
-Bye!

12:37.640 --> 12:41.760
I think it's time... for tequila.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.680
-Could you call me a cab?
-Sure.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.800
Sure.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.640
One, two, three.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.920
Gavin, it's been a lovely evening.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.240
My pleasure.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.680
But I have to go now.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.480
No, you really don't.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.040
-Yes, I have to.
-No.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.040
Yes.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.880
-Gavin, no.
-What?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.600
Oh, come on.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.720
Gavin, please,
I really don't want to.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.520
Oh, I see. Forgive me, my mistake.
It's because you're so...

13:23.680 --> 13:24.800
Special.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.880
-No.
-Show me how special you are.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.600
-What do you mean?
-You know what I mean.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.360
-No, don't.
-You know what I mean.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.320
Gavin, no. Please.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.080
Stop. No, Gavin. Please. No.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.920
-Come here.
-Stop. No!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.320
-Come here.
-Don't! Stop!

13:42.400 --> 13:45.120
-I don't want to. Please!
-Come here.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.400
Let me go!

13:53.240 --> 13:55.160
You fucking broke my nose!

13:57.200 --> 13:59.040
You are so fired!

14:53.320 --> 14:55.000
<i>-Hi, Dad!</i>
-Hello, darling.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.440
Finally! Pick up when I phone you,
or I get worried.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.240
<i>Do you know how expensive talking</i>
<i>on the phone is? I can text or Skype.</i>

15:03.080 --> 15:06.480
<i>-Where are you right now?</i>
-Åland, with Oskar.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.920
<i>-So soon?</i>
-I came early.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.440
There's a lot to do.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.440
<i>I bet it's really lovely there now,</i>
<i>all decked out for Christmas.</i>

15:17.440 --> 15:21.560
Well... Sure, lovely.
When are you coming back?

15:21.840 --> 15:27.000
<i>I'm not sure. Fredrik wants to go</i>
<i>to Cambodia, but...</i>

15:27.720 --> 15:29.600
<i>I don't know. I'm feeling homesick.</i>

15:30.280 --> 15:33.840
You'll be back for Christmas, right?
Unless you go to your mum's.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.080
<i>I don't know.</i>

15:38.600 --> 15:40.160
I'll be Santa.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.320
<i>Wear that,</i>
<i>and I definitely won't come home.</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:52.400
-I miss you. Do you need any money?
<i>-No, Fredrik's got some.</i>

15:52.480 --> 15:54.240
Do you have enough to get home?

15:55.960 --> 15:56.960
Kim?

16:32.120 --> 16:34.920
<i>-Lasse, it's about time you called.</i>
<i>-Yeah, hi.</i>

16:36.960 --> 16:40.560
-I'm in.
<i>-I knew I could count on you.</i>

16:40.880 --> 16:42.360
Hey...

16:43.400 --> 16:45.400
-I want 15,000.
<i>-Okay. Done.</i>

16:46.000 --> 16:49.320
<i>I'll send you the coordinates</i>
<i>and the time and keep you posted.</i>

17:43.880 --> 17:46.920
SEE YOU TOMORROW
/M

18:37.960 --> 18:40.240
<i>-Hi, Dad.</i>
-How are you, darling?

18:40.320 --> 18:44.640
It's fun but so hard.
There's so much I have to memorize.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.680
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>how you can learn it all by heart.</i>

18:48.760 --> 18:54.200
-Are you coming home for Christmas?
<i>-Yeah. To rest, not to work.</i>

18:54.680 --> 18:57.360
I get that. Anything else?

18:58.000 --> 19:03.640
Anything exciting that you want
to tell me? Anything I should know?

19:03.720 --> 19:05.680
<i>No. Like what?</i>

19:11.160 --> 19:13.680
Dad, have you tried phoning Mum?

19:16.000 --> 19:20.400
Cecilia, I should really
get back to work.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.160
Loads to do. Back to work.

19:24.240 --> 19:28.840
-Take care, darling. I love you.
-You too. Bye.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.360
Hello. I don't think we've met.
Laura Nord.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.480
Lasse. I own this place
with my siblings.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.200
Oh, you're the city boy?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.480
You could say that.
But I grew up here.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.440
Don't take it personally. Small
towns, you know. People get jealous.

21:00.280 --> 21:03.520
-Pretty young for a detective.
-That's Eskil, my son.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.520
I couldn't get a sitter.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.680
Needs must.
In fact, that's why I came.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.360
To get a sitter?

21:12.080 --> 21:15.280
No, because there's a weather alert.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.640
The first winter storm of the year
is not to be taken lightly.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.840
Listen to the radio.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.800
-Best to stay indoors, then?
-Right.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.080
Thanks for the heads-up.
Nice to meet you!

21:27.160 --> 21:28.440
Take care.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.000
Hi.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.720
-I'm so glad to see you.
-Same here.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.360
-How did the film go?
-Not quite as I'd planned.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.400
-Why?
-Never mind.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.960
How are things here?

22:17.040 --> 22:18.880
-Well...
-How is Oskar?

22:21.520 --> 22:24.080
-Let's go in. I'll take that.
-Thanks.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.080
-Do you want some coffee?
-Yes, please.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.160
-Oh my God!
-I know.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.920
-What have you done?
-Us?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.840
It was even worse yesterday.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.280
Bloody hell...

22:42.320 --> 22:44.880
-Not exactly Christmassy.
-No...

22:44.960 --> 22:46.600
Should we just give it a miss?

22:46.680 --> 22:49.600
-We just have to get cracking.
-We'll never get it done in time.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.800
We have to! We've got ads out.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.040
But no food or drinks
have been ordered.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.400
Oskar has completely crashed.

22:56.480 --> 23:00.080
-I'm not even sure there's any money.
-We'll work it out.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.720
We should have the tree here,
where it's always been.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.720
And some decorations...
Did you find the box with ornaments?

23:08.120 --> 23:11.240
No. Didn't we used to have the tree
by the front desk?

23:11.320 --> 23:15.600
No, it's always been here.
And we have to get the little Santas.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.560
Santas?

23:17.640 --> 23:21.720
The ornamental Santas
Mum used to have.

23:22.080 --> 23:27.040
White table cloths, green napkins
and those red candelabras.

23:27.120 --> 23:31.720
-I thought they were gold.
-Red. What's wrong with your memory?

23:32.280 --> 23:35.040
And here,
we had the Christmas stockings here.

23:35.680 --> 23:40.560
We all got a present each on
Christmas morning. Remember?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.640
I remember.

23:42.720 --> 23:46.720
Too bad Christmas isn't as magical
now as it was when we were kids.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.120
We remember
our childhood differently.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.800
I descended
from Heaven to join the people,

24:37.880 --> 24:42.360
to teach them to love their neighbour
as they do themselves.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.520
For if they do not,
no safe haven can exist,

24:47.280 --> 24:50.400
in Heaven or on Earth.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.720
Nowhere will they be free
from pain and despair.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.160
-Where did you find all of that?
-Up in the attic.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.680
-Not everything...
-...can be in plain sight, I know.

25:41.760 --> 25:46.360
Shouldn't you give it a few decades
before you become exactly like Mum?

25:48.280 --> 25:49.240
Look!

25:50.120 --> 25:52.400
-It's Koskenkorva.
-I know.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.800
-Damn it.
-I told you so.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.160
Did you like my sermon?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.680
Was it too dark?

26:29.640 --> 26:31.480
Can't we take a trip somewhere?

26:36.040 --> 26:38.680
Wouldn't it be nice
with a bit of sun?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.960
Hello? What do you think?

26:46.560 --> 26:51.000
-Did you cut your hair?
-That was almost two weeks ago.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.760
Right... It looks good.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.800
Thanks.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.880
-Hi, Oskar!
-Hi, Jonna.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.320
Look at your beard!

27:33.400 --> 27:36.880
-But I come bearing no presents.
-Nobody's earned any, anyway.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.000
Fair point. Thank you.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.720
Right. Welcome home.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.760
Cheers!

28:00.880 --> 28:03.480
I guess she's staying away
a little longer.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.560
Try to get her home.
I'd like to see her.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.320
-Is Cecilia coming?
-Yes.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.320
And Liv? When is she coming?

28:15.320 --> 28:18.040
When is Liv coming? You don't know?

28:18.720 --> 28:21.560
She must have told you.
You haven't talked?

28:21.640 --> 28:23.680
-Jonna.
-I'll just...

28:27.840 --> 28:31.040
-What? I'm allowed to ask.
-Don't pressure him.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.240
I wasn't!

28:33.520 --> 28:35.160
She might not even...

28:35.800 --> 28:37.880
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I tried.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.960
You tried to talk to him
about his feelings?

28:45.640 --> 28:48.160
-Is that all that matters?
-It does in fact matter.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.920
I have to make a call.
Ease up, all right?

29:05.520 --> 29:06.560
Listen...

29:07.920 --> 29:10.200
I didn't mean to pressure you.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.800
-Did you have a fight?
-Not as far as I know.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Okay.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.640
How are
the Christmas dinners looking?

29:25.960 --> 29:28.240
Looking? I don't know.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.600
I can see how it looks in here.
What about the rest?

29:32.680 --> 29:36.320
Orders and staff...
Have you done anything?

29:40.120 --> 29:42.240
Do we have any reservations at all?

29:45.080 --> 29:48.800
-Oskar?
-No. I haven't exactly been myself.

29:56.680 --> 30:00.000
<i>The number you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is currently unavailable.</i>

30:00.480 --> 30:01.840
<i>Please try again.</i>

30:10.040 --> 30:12.200
The wind is really picking up.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.560
Good, you're back. Let's talk ideas.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.720
Right... Ideas for what?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.480
How to make more money
during the Christmas season.

30:23.680 --> 30:27.360
-Aren't the dinners enough?
-I think we should do more.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.920
-Like activities.
-Activities?

30:31.000 --> 30:35.960
We could do a full weekend break
for the overnight guests.

30:36.040 --> 30:40.160
Maybe whisky tasting,
some excursions...

30:40.240 --> 30:42.240
Ice fishing, perhaps?

30:43.480 --> 30:46.480
It's windy out there.
The guests will freeze to death.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.880
Good, so they'll drink more
when they come back.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.680
So the activity is to get windswept?

30:53.040 --> 30:55.800
You know what?
We should get outdoor hot tubs.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.920
You know, for the guests
to have a drink in.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.960
-Do we have to build them?
-I'm sure we can rent.

31:04.040 --> 31:07.280
Build one if you want,
but I think we can rent them.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.000
-Sounds good.
-Sounds expensive.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.840
Please. You have to spend money
to make money.

31:13.920 --> 31:17.280
But who is doing the spending?
And what is there to spend?

31:18.200 --> 31:20.720
-Have you got any money?
-No.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.960
How about you? Didn't think so.

31:25.040 --> 31:29.160
Please, think outside the box
for once. You'll get all of it back.

31:29.240 --> 31:32.160
I wish I could
"think outside the box".

31:32.240 --> 31:35.680
I wish I could make all your plans
happen, but I have no money.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.000
We'll do the sums
and see how far we get.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.600
-I might be able to get some.
-How?

31:46.400 --> 31:49.680
-If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
-And if it does, it does.

31:50.080 --> 31:54.280
Things never work out the way you
want. That's what I've learned.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.720
To be honest, I'm surprised
you even came back here.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
Why?

32:00.840 --> 32:02.520
I wasn't sure if you'd forgive me.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.600
There is nothing to forgive.
Don't think like that.

32:07.680 --> 32:12.040
I thought this was my punishment,
ending up alone out here.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.720
Left here on my own.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.640
I need a smoke.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.720
Is there forgiveness to be had
for patricide?

32:35.040 --> 32:37.000
Will I ever be free of the guilt?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Can I have one?

32:58.040 --> 33:00.560
-I thought you quit.
-I did.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.800
Odd that Liv hasn't been in touch.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.760
Have you spoken to Liv?

33:19.160 --> 33:20.040
No...

33:21.600 --> 33:25.440
-Lasse? Have you spoken...?
-No, I haven't spoken to her.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.160
Oskar? I need you.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.160
Come on.

34:42.720 --> 34:46.200
-Where did you go?
-To check on the boat.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.400
Maybe it doesn't seem like it...

35:08.280 --> 35:10.320
But I'm really glad you two are here.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
Me too.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.560
I saw you.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.960
At Midsummer. I saw you kissing.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.520
-It meant nothing. It was just...
-...unfinished business?

35:29.480 --> 35:30.800
Something like that.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.240
Was that it?
Did anything else happen?

35:44.120 --> 35:47.320
That was it. Just one kiss.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.040
Nothing else happened.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.000
I know that it isn't up to me,

36:00.920 --> 36:03.480
but I hope we can put it behind us.

36:07.120 --> 36:11.560
-I broke you two up first.
-That's ancient history now.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.840
-Now she doesn't want either of us.
-No.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.840
That's her loss.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.280
ALMOST THERE. STRONG WIND.
READY?

36:31.200 --> 36:32.880
Who do you keep texting?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.720
What was that?

36:58.880 --> 37:02.800
-What the hell is going on?
-We'll have to ride the storm out.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.520
No! Damn it.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.080
-Have we got torches?
-I'll check.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.200
-I wonder if it's just our house.
-Here.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.960
-The power is down everywhere.
-Yeah...

37:34.960 --> 37:36.000
What's that?

37:37.360 --> 37:38.440
A flare.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.320
What should we do?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.120
-Where are you going?
-To the boat!

38:09.480 --> 38:11.680
-Nothing.
-I can't get a signal either.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.760
-How about the emergency number?
-It should still work.

38:17.040 --> 38:20.680
It doesn't. We have to do something.
We have to help.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.040
What is he playing at?

39:09.000 --> 39:13.120
Is he crazy? What is he playing at?
I can't see a thing.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.920
Mischa!

40:02.760 --> 40:03.800
Mischa!

40:06.040 --> 40:07.880
Mischa?

40:14.840 --> 40:16.080
What the...

40:20.920 --> 40:22.000
Mischa!

41:01.960 --> 41:03.280
Damn it, Lasse...

41:18.280 --> 41:19.520
Mischa!

41:20.680 --> 41:21.520
Mischa!

42:02.560 --> 42:05.520
-Did you get through?
-No, no signal.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.640
-Nothing?
-I can't get a signal...

42:50.040 --> 42:50.920
What the hell?

43:12.600 --> 43:15.600
