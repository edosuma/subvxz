WEBVTT

00:19.521 --> 00:22.691
--There.

00:22.774 --> 00:24.150
It just hit.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.530
It's gotta be 40 stories, at least.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.658
--Down!

00:35.662 --> 00:37.496
They're on all sides.
Half a dozen, at least.

00:37.581 --> 00:39.373
-I got a problem.
-Right with you.

00:39.457 --> 00:41.125
No, you don't get it.
I can't get a read on these guys.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.794
There's no sound, there's no heartbeat,
there's nothing.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.629
-They're trained to hide themselves.
-How do you know?

00:44.713 --> 00:46.715
Don't focus on the fighters,
track their weapons.

00:46.798 --> 00:48.758
-They have swords.
-They have swords, I can hear.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.598
Elektra, no!

01:52.864 --> 01:54.532
Matthew...

02:28.942 --> 02:30.276
So...

02:33.947 --> 02:36.574
who wants to get the hell out of here?

03:48.396 --> 03:49.856
She's losing too much blood.

03:49.939 --> 03:50.982
Hell of a scrape.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.441
Where are you taking her?

03:53.777 --> 03:55.779
They're still coming.
Fast little shits.

03:57.113 --> 03:59.365
- Who are they, Stick?
- Bad time to chat.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.691
-Matty!
-On it!

04:37.946 --> 04:39.447
- Watch your ass.
- Yeah.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.287
No, no, no.
No, she's dying.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.581
- Stick, she's dying.
- Not if I can stop it.

04:48.664 --> 04:49.833
We need to get her to a hospital.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.501
Doctors can't help her.
I can.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.587
We're going to your place.
It's her only shot.

04:54.670 --> 04:57.673
Sweetie, stay with me.
Stay with me.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.300
Second wave.
Brace her.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.067
End of that batch.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.487
There'll be more.

05:21.239 --> 05:22.866
Always more.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.005
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is bad.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.090
- What's happening to her?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.841
You got baking soda?

05:40.925 --> 05:42.385
Yeah, in the fridge, why?

05:42.468 --> 05:45.721
To neutralize the acid
in the toilet bowl cleaner.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.474
Plus whiskey, pliers, black tea.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.601
--Tell me what's going on, Stick.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.770
Do you wanna talk
or save your girlfriend?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.485
Her heart's skipping.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.905
- Whiskey.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.659
The toxins in her bloodstream
are shutting everything down.

06:06.742 --> 06:07.785
Is she gonna live?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.245
Baking soda?

06:11.164 --> 06:12.665
I thought you got it.

06:16.294 --> 06:17.795
Matthew!

06:17.878 --> 06:20.339
I need pliers and hot tea.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.053
The pliers are behind you.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.650
--Matthew...

06:39.733 --> 06:41.569
I'm here.
I'm here.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.948
If I die...

06:45.031 --> 06:48.201
No, you're not gonna die.
You hear me?

06:48.284 --> 06:49.994
Elektra, look at me.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.371
- Hey, hey, focus on me.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.623
Breathe. Breathe.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.292
That's good. That's good.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.710
I'm sorry.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.046
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.297
Bring her in here!

07:01.380 --> 07:02.631
Yeah.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.179
One, two, three.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.108
-Clean sheets.
-Yeah.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.405
Can you save her?

07:26.489 --> 07:28.324
Not before I make her worse.

07:30.118 --> 07:31.410
Oh, Jesus!
Stick, take it easy!

07:31.494 --> 07:33.496
- Those blades were poisoned.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.039
She'll be dead in 20 minutes

07:35.123 --> 07:37.833
if I don't pull some serious
juju out of my ass.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.710
Make the goddamn tea!

07:43.256 --> 07:44.715
Easy.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.063
Easy. Easy, young lady.
I'm right here.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.906
...forgive those who trespass against us.

08:10.116 --> 08:12.910
Matty, use that hearing of yours.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.704
How's her heart rate?

08:21.044 --> 08:23.254
Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
It's steady.

08:25.381 --> 08:26.590
Sheets.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.683
Not too neat...

08:36.642 --> 08:38.769
but...

08:38.852 --> 08:40.563
it'll do.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.730
Tea?

08:47.445 --> 08:49.988
Thank you.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.034
Ah...

09:24.898 --> 09:26.442
She'll recover?

09:27.401 --> 09:28.986
Twenty-four hours will tell.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.905
I've known her to pull through worse.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.284
What'd you just say?

09:35.368 --> 09:38.537
Ellie's a real fighter.
Always has been.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.375
You... You know her?

09:42.458 --> 09:44.293
I didn't mention that?

09:45.878 --> 09:47.505
What the hell's going on?
How do you know Elektra?

09:47.588 --> 09:49.590
-I'm not done in there.
-I want some answers!

09:49.673 --> 09:50.758
Everybody wants something.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.969
-Do you want me to throw you out?
-Not unless you want her to die.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.020
Sit down, Matty.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.774
Where is he?

10:07.650 --> 10:11.112
Um, I may have told him
just to stay home today.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.655
You what?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.448
He wasn't actually supposed to do it.

10:14.532 --> 10:17.285
Whoa, whoa, Foggy,
what the hell happened yesterday?

10:17.368 --> 10:18.702
I can't do this alone.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.413
I didn't even wanna take this case.

10:20.496 --> 10:23.582
-It'll be okay, I--
-The whole city is watching.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.958
If I screw up, I'd never work again.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.795
And, frankly, you'd probably never work
again, either, by association, which--

10:27.878 --> 10:30.673
Stop, Foggy. Stop thinking
about screwing up, about losing.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.133
You need to think about winning.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.845
Colonel Ray Schoonover,
United States Marine Corps.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.556
Do you swear to tell the truth,

10:38.639 --> 10:41.809
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

10:42.351 --> 10:43.477
I do.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.816
- You got this.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.484
Counsel?

10:58.451 --> 11:00.661
Colonel, how long have you
known the defendant?

11:00.744 --> 11:03.080
I'd say, the better part of a decade.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.832
Most of his career in the Marine Corps.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.710
So you're familiar with his service
in the Middle East?

11:07.793 --> 11:09.545
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran?

11:09.628 --> 11:11.672
Yes, very familiar.

11:11.755 --> 11:14.007
I wonder if you could tell us

11:14.091 --> 11:16.927
how Lieutenant Frank Castle
won the Navy Cross?

11:17.010 --> 11:20.348
Due to the nature of that mission,
you'll have to understand that

11:20.431 --> 11:22.600
the precise circumstances are classified.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.605
Um...

11:29.315 --> 11:31.817
How about the part that's not?

11:32.693 --> 11:35.153
Lieutenant Frank Castle
was part of a small team.

11:35.238 --> 11:37.323
He was conducting
a close target reconnaissance

11:37.406 --> 11:39.450
in the vicinity of the Hindu Kush.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.704
The mission became compromised,
taking enemy contact on three sides.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.083
Lieutenant Castle wanted to abort.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.087
Said the mission was a bust,
pulling the plug would save lives.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.007
- Officer in charge said "no."
- And why was that?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.175
Maybe he wanted
more medals on his chest.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.428
Doesn't matter.
Either way, Frank was right.

11:59.512 --> 12:02.890
They were cut off, boxed into a canyon.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.933
And what happened next?

12:05.017 --> 12:07.811
Within the first hour,
the officer in charge of that mission

12:07.895 --> 12:09.855
got his arm blown off.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.190
So Lieutenant Castle assumed command.

12:12.275 --> 12:15.319
His only goal was to get
his men out alive.

12:15.403 --> 12:18.531
The enemy had set up an ambush

12:18.614 --> 12:21.950
at the only LZ that would accommodate
one of our birds.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.035
Sorry, Colonel?

12:23.118 --> 12:27.456
LZ is a landing zone
that can accommodate a helicopter.

12:27.540 --> 12:31.294
So the enemy,
they block this landing zone,

12:31.377 --> 12:34.797
knowing it was the only shot
the team had to get out alive.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.715
All they had to do was wait.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.926
They knew that Frank's team
had to come to them.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.052
Fish in a barrel.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.387
So to speak.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.431
Only fish don't know they're gonna die.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.891
These men did.

12:45.974 --> 12:51.647
Frank went to the LZ all by himself
to draw the bastards away.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.691
Why didn't he order
one of his men to do it?

12:53.774 --> 12:54.775
He certainly could have.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.777
Not his style.

12:59.154 --> 13:02.783
So the men hear the fire fight break out.
All hell breaks loose.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.868
Frank against God knows how many.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.120
And then there was silence.

13:07.204 --> 13:11.500
The team thinks, "That's it.
Frank's dead, and we're next."

13:13.586 --> 13:16.880
Next sound they hear is the helos,
the helicopters.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.800
They get to the landing zone,
you know what they see?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.387
Frank Castle, standing there, grinning.

13:23.471 --> 13:27.099
Thirty-two muj surrounding him, all dead.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.644
Son of a gun cleared that entire LZ
all by himself.

13:31.354 --> 13:32.480
How?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.483
By being Frank Castle.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.485
-And his men survived?
-All of 'em.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.446
Including the idiot officer
that got 'em trapped in the first place.

13:40.529 --> 13:43.699
If you had to sum up Frank Castle,
how would you do it?

13:43.782 --> 13:45.701
I would say Frank Castle is a man

13:45.784 --> 13:49.037
who would gladly give his life
to keep others safe.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.248
And the crimes
he's accused of today?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.125
Could the man you knew
have committed them?

13:53.208 --> 13:54.752
Absolutely not.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.715
Lieutenant Frank Castle
that I know is a hero.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.634
A man who deserves our respect...

14:02.718 --> 14:04.177
and our gratitude.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.139
Not the same man.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.643
Thank you, sir.
No more questions, Your Honor.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.021
People?

14:22.154 --> 14:26.241
I'd like to personally thank you
for your service to this country, Colonel.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.744
My father served in Vietnam.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.622
-Do you know what he told me about medals?
-No, ma'am.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.708
He said the only people
who truly know what happened

14:34.792 --> 14:36.084
are the ones that were there.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.004
You told a nice story, Colonel...

14:39.547 --> 14:43.634
but how can we know that it happened
the way you described?

14:43.717 --> 14:47.262
Well, perhaps I wasn't clear.
I was there, ma'am.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.642
That officer that didn't listen to Frank,
got his men trapped...

14:52.225 --> 14:53.310
you're looking at him.

14:53.394 --> 14:54.895
--And believe me when I tell you,

14:54.978 --> 14:58.399
I thank God every day
that I only lost my arm.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.528
That man saved my life,
the lives of his entire team.

15:03.696 --> 15:05.030
If it was up to me,

15:05.113 --> 15:07.741
he'd have a Medal of Honor
hanging around his neck.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.746
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

15:15.416 --> 15:16.834
How'd you miss that in his file?

15:16.917 --> 15:18.251
All the names were redacted.

15:18.335 --> 15:19.377
Not good.

15:19.462 --> 15:20.879
No shit.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.549
Hey, Matt couldn't have done it better.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.468
It was good.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.310
How is she?

15:35.393 --> 15:38.396
Well... she'll live.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.858
Yeah? You sure?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.610
Sure as I am of anything.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.743
Jesus, didn't we do this already?

15:50.826 --> 15:52.119
Start talking, Stick.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.079
It's about the war.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.789
What is?

15:55.873 --> 15:57.165
All of it.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.211
Roxxon, Midland Circle,
the damn hole, Elektra--

16:01.294 --> 16:04.256
All right, you've been using this war
as an excuse since the day I met you,

16:04.339 --> 16:06.842
and you still haven't told me
a goddamn thing about it.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.511
-You know what I think?
-Tell me.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.345
I think you're full of shit.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.014
I don't think there is any war.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.433
I think you're just a sick old fighter
dying to hit people,

16:15.518 --> 16:17.227
so you make up stories
to justify your behavior.

16:19.522 --> 16:22.065
And then, you rope in the wounded...

16:22.149 --> 16:25.110
so that you can sit back and watch them
throw away their lives,

16:25.193 --> 16:26.570
and you can feel important.

16:26.654 --> 16:27.821
Sit down.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.034
Sit down, Matty.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.584
It all began centuries ago.

16:40.668 --> 16:42.169
Nobody knows how many,

16:42.252 --> 16:44.004
but the shit we're dipping into...

16:44.630 --> 16:46.298
is ancient.

16:46.882 --> 16:52.429
Back then, warlords and their gangs
ruled the countryside.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.848
Not that much different from today.

16:55.766 --> 17:01.647
Bloodthirsty, greedy brutes after loot,
pussy, booze, same ol', same ol'.

17:02.815 --> 17:05.067
But... one day,

17:05.150 --> 17:08.236
one of these collections of assholes

17:08.319 --> 17:12.115
comes across a thing
they can barely understand.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.367
Real treasure.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.119
Not gold, or rubies, or any of that.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.959
They found the secret.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.294
What secret?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.671
Immortality.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.882
Bringing the dead back to life.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.134
Come on, Stick.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.305
I thought
you were a Catholic, Matty.

17:36.473 --> 17:40.936
Doesn't your whole belief system
hinge on one guy pulling that off?

17:44.815 --> 17:46.024
So...

17:47.735 --> 17:50.153
Free from the fear of death,

17:50.237 --> 17:55.743
these pieces of shit step up,
kill their master, take over,

17:55.826 --> 17:57.911
and paint the shores of the Far East

17:57.995 --> 18:00.998
with the blood of anybody
who stands in their way.

18:02.625 --> 18:06.754
They grow in size, power, wealth...

18:08.213 --> 18:10.340
spread across Asia...

18:10.423 --> 18:13.010
and finally give themselves a name.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.387
Yaminote.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.515
It means, "The Hand."

18:20.392 --> 18:22.394
And did they have a goal?

18:22.477 --> 18:26.023
Weapons.
It's always weapons.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.441
Like, guns, bombs?

18:28.525 --> 18:29.693
Worse.

18:30.778 --> 18:32.821
Thing called a Black Sky.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.241
So, what's it do, this, uh, Black Sky?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.118
Nobody knows exactly.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.579
Why not?

18:41.664 --> 18:44.625
Because they've never activated one.

18:45.751 --> 18:48.378
They've tried.
They'll try again.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.173
But...

18:53.175 --> 18:55.385
the Hand made one mistake.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.179
They made enemies.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.430
Bingo.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.475
Some say it was just a kid.

19:03.727 --> 19:08.315
Hand comes into his village,
kills everyone...

19:08.398 --> 19:10.067
almost.

19:10.608 --> 19:16.489
Kid... pulls the knife from the breast
of his dead mother...

19:16.573 --> 19:19.242
--...and goes to work.

19:20.953 --> 19:24.039
He cuts down some of the Hand's
finest warriors.

19:25.791 --> 19:29.586
They're lying dead... kid's standing.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.507
They give him a name.
The Chaste.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.260
And he's just one kid?
Alone?

19:37.344 --> 19:41.223
Kid grows up,
rounds up every warrior he can.

19:42.224 --> 19:46.436
Men, women, young, old,
doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.938
And they do.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.232
Without mercy.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.197
And the only protection this world
has against the Hand.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.159
Wow.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.956
Now, in this fairy tale...

20:07.374 --> 20:10.168
you're the Chaste, right? That's...

20:10.252 --> 20:11.879
Is that it?

20:14.297 --> 20:16.091
It's why I didn't tell you.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.886
No, no, it's... It's good.
It leaves you front and center.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.389
Finding the Hand,
keeping the Black Skies at bay.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.557
Murdering when it suits you.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.519
Believe it or don't.

20:28.520 --> 20:32.775
The fact remains that the city
you're sworn to protect

20:32.858 --> 20:36.486
is ground zero in a war
it doesn't even know is happening.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.696
That hole is just the start.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.451
So, you can kill, die,

20:43.535 --> 20:47.831
or sit on your ass
and watch Hell's Kitchen burn...

20:49.499 --> 20:55.005
but this war is bigger than you,
or me, or any of our...

20:57.590 --> 20:59.092
problems.

20:59.176 --> 21:02.763
And you've pulled Elektra to your side,
haven't you?

21:02.846 --> 21:04.890
Welcome to the world, kid.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.729
Elektra works for me.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.198
The bullet penetrated
Mr. Castle's skull

21:21.281 --> 21:22.449
in the lower right quadrant,

21:22.532 --> 21:25.452
or more specifically,
the sphenofrontal suture,

21:25.535 --> 21:29.081
which is the cranial suture between
the sphenoid bone and the frontal bones,

21:29.164 --> 21:30.415
both here and here.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.669
I believe what my expert witness
is trying to convey

21:34.752 --> 21:37.589
is that my client, Frank Castle,
was shot...

21:37.672 --> 21:40.758
point blank, execution style, in the head.

21:42.052 --> 21:46.764
Could you please describe the damage
Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet?

21:46.849 --> 21:48.809
It fragmented on impact,
causing damage

21:48.892 --> 21:51.769
in both the right frontal lobe
and temporal lobe of his brain.

21:51.854 --> 21:54.231
What are the effects of such an injury?

21:54.314 --> 21:57.775
Mr. Castle is suffering from
what we call sympathetic storming.

21:57.860 --> 22:00.362
It's a heightened and ongoing
state of fight or flight,

22:00.445 --> 22:03.656
in which the sympathetic nervous system
is hyperactive.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.452
As if he is reliving the incident
of trauma over and over again.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.956
It can plunge a seemingly peaceful
individual into...

22:11.039 --> 22:13.125
mental and emotional chaos.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.585
It sure sounds a lot like PTSD.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.212
No, that's not where we're going.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.796
Just... listen.

22:18.881 --> 22:20.757
Could you define it for the jury, please?

22:20.841 --> 22:23.093
Extreme emotional disturbance.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.761
It's twofold.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.181
First, the defendant is so emotionally
disturbed that he loses control.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.434
And second, the defendant
has a reasonable explanation

22:31.518 --> 22:33.520
for said disturbance,
from his point of view.

22:33.603 --> 22:37.565
Are you aware that Frank Castle's
wife, son, and daughter

22:37.649 --> 22:39.567
were all murdered right in front of him

22:39.651 --> 22:41.736
when he sustained the brain injury
in question?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.196
An injury which, you say,

22:43.280 --> 22:46.909
keeps him in a perpetual state
of mental and emotional chaos?

22:46.992 --> 22:47.993
I am, yes.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.121
With that in mind, would you say that
Frank Castle's mental state

22:51.204 --> 22:55.542
satisfies the definition of
"extreme emotional disturbance"?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.794
Objection, calls for a conclusion.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.297
Your Honor,
Dr. Lee is an expert on the brain.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.340
He is qualified to an opinion,

23:02.424 --> 23:06.511
and said opinion is not only relevant,
but imperative to the case.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.182
Overruled.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.391
Dr. Lee?

23:11.474 --> 23:14.811
Personally, I do believe
he is suffering from EED, yes.

23:14.894 --> 23:18.523
And one who's suffering from
extreme emotional disturbance,

23:18.606 --> 23:22.652
is it possible to willfully
premeditate a crime?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.488
Any infractions would be considered
crimes of passion.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.325
How many of your other patients

23:28.408 --> 23:31.828
witnessed their families being
brutally murdered right in front of them?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.746
Other than Frank Castle?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.082
He's the only one.

23:35.165 --> 23:38.668
And so would you say the circumstances
surrounding Frank's mental state

23:38.751 --> 23:41.296
is different than those
of your other patients?

23:41.379 --> 23:42.630
I would.

23:43.631 --> 23:47.219
And what exactly would that difference be,
in simple terms?

23:47.302 --> 23:49.387
Frank Castle's been through hell.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.431
Thank you.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.975
You killed my dad!

23:53.058 --> 23:54.517
I don't give a shit
what you've been through!

23:54.601 --> 23:56.353
- Order! Order in the court!
- You killed him!

23:56.436 --> 23:59.064
-I saw him in his coffin...
-Please remove that young man now.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.399
He was my dad,
and now he's gone!

24:02.817 --> 24:06.863
I'm now instructing each and every
one of you to disregard that outburst

24:06.946 --> 24:10.408
and to not let it influence
your opinions on this case.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.162
I did that.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.373
Right?

24:18.375 --> 24:21.128
That kid, I took his father from him.
I did that.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.547
-Yeah, you did.
-Uh-huh.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.178
Look, Frank, I can't judge you.

24:34.682 --> 24:37.352
That was tough in there
for you, right? It was...

24:37.435 --> 24:39.062
It was, um, hard?

24:42.899 --> 24:44.276
Yeah.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.696
Okay.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.199
You gotta do something for me.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.950
Hmm?

24:53.035 --> 24:55.078
I need you to take the stand.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.579
Come on, for what?
Why would I...

24:56.663 --> 25:00.083
The jury has to know what happened to you,
what you go through every single day.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.669
After this afternoon...

25:02.752 --> 25:05.172
I don't think we have any other shot.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.631
What?

25:06.714 --> 25:08.675
And what do you think
is gonna happen here?

25:08.758 --> 25:09.759
We're not gonna win this thing.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.803
No, but we can still reduce the charges.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.558
Look, that might not be important to you,
but it is important to me.

25:17.184 --> 25:20.103
All of them,
they all think that you're a monster.

25:20.187 --> 25:22.272
But I know that you're not.
You're not!

25:24.941 --> 25:26.901
You sure about that?

25:28.320 --> 25:30.655
What if I find these men
that did that to my family?

25:30.738 --> 25:31.739
What if...

25:34.076 --> 25:36.035
What if nothing changes?

25:38.955 --> 25:41.083
What if this is just me now?

25:46.421 --> 25:48.756
Then don't you deserve to know that, too?

25:55.305 --> 25:56.639
Foggy!

25:56.723 --> 25:57.807
Hey.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.936
He'll do it.
He'll take the stand.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.771
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.483
Look, unless you have a better idea,
I think--

26:06.566 --> 26:08.485
How did we even get here?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.320
This guy's a murderer.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.281
He's killed fathers and brothers.
You heard that kid.

26:13.365 --> 26:14.824
Why are we helping him?

26:17.827 --> 26:21.539
Do you think that Frank is completely
and totally mentally healthy?

26:22.207 --> 26:24.000
-I think he's batshit.
-Yeah?

26:24.083 --> 26:26.169
Well, then that's why you help him.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.214
--Put him on the stand, Foggy.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.882
Shit.
Okay.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.551
-One caveat, though.
-Okay.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.887
-We get Matt to do the questioning.
-No.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.722
- Yes.
- No.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.767
You're doing great, okay?
You're making Reyes play defense.

26:40.850 --> 26:41.851
You... you don't need Matt for this.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.728
-I do, Karen!
-Why do you always do this?

26:43.811 --> 26:46.481
Why do you put Matt in the driver's seat
when you can do this yourself?

26:46.564 --> 26:48.316
Matt and I are partners for a reason.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.611
There's some things that I'm better at,
and there's things that he's better at.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.112
This is something that he'll be better at.

26:53.196 --> 26:54.697
He's barely spent two seconds with Frank.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.492
I know, but that kid
nearly destroyed us in there.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.995
And at this moment, Matt is the right
person to question Frank.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.455
He just is.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.251
Okay.

27:06.334 --> 27:07.335
I'll get him.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.319
-I'm sorry--
-When we met...

27:34.779 --> 27:36.198
was it fate?

27:37.865 --> 27:38.866
Was it luck?

27:41.369 --> 27:43.079
Or was I a mission?

27:49.252 --> 27:50.878
Mission.

28:10.315 --> 28:14.277
Stick trained me a long time,
like he trained you.

28:14.819 --> 28:17.614
He's not a sentimental man,
but he wanted you back.

28:20.450 --> 28:23.786
He wanted you to forget about law,
your friends...

28:24.746 --> 28:25.747
your city.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.251
He thought I could distract you.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.629
He was right.

28:32.712 --> 28:33.755
No.

28:35.089 --> 28:38.134
Because I did the thing
I promised him I'd never do.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.596
I fell in love with you, Matthew.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.016
Listen to my heartbeat, if you must.

28:45.099 --> 28:46.934
You know it's true.

28:49.604 --> 28:53.441
Stick told me about some
secret Japanese organization.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.652
The Hand.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.696
They won't stop until
they've infiltrated your whole city.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.824
Killed every last member of the Chaste.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.951
-Stick--
-You.

29:04.035 --> 29:06.120
We live on the front lines.

29:06.663 --> 29:08.456
Like it or not.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.583
It doesn't mean we have to fight
Stick's way.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.545
He kills his enemies,
and we don't have to.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.630
You make that choice
sound so easy.

29:15.713 --> 29:18.508
No, it's not easy.
It's impossible.

29:19.133 --> 29:23.388
But it's a choice and it's a choice
that I remake every single day.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.015
Every second, sometimes.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.934
And you can, too.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.353
Matthew, there are things about me
you don't know.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.729
-I don't need to know.
-I want you to.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.023
I don't care,
whatever you've done in the past...

29:34.106 --> 29:36.693
Elektra, whoever you've chosen to be,
you're free now, all right?

29:36.776 --> 29:38.945
You could have killed those men
at the hole, but you didn't.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.280
Because you're not Stick.

29:40.363 --> 29:43.783
And screw him for ever making you
feel like you might be, even for a second.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.242
-He can hear you.
-I don't care.

29:45.327 --> 29:47.954
When you were hurt,
when I thought I might lose you, I...

29:49.706 --> 29:51.291
I...

29:51.374 --> 29:53.335
I felt hollow.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.546
Now, I have no reason to trust you.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.256
You've lied to me more times
than I can count.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.343
But if you leave Stick...

30:03.094 --> 30:04.304
be with me.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.640
Fight this war by my side.

30:07.724 --> 30:08.933
My way.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.395
Our way.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.232
Why are you so good?

30:20.445 --> 30:21.696
I'm not.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.866
Yes.

30:27.243 --> 30:29.329
There's a light inside you.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.502
I tried to snuff it out in college.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.631
I'm so lucky I failed.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.514
Someone... someone's here.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.141
You got company.

30:51.601 --> 30:52.852
Hey.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.731
Karen...

30:57.690 --> 30:59.191
Hi.

30:59.692 --> 31:02.404
Um, let's, uh...

31:02.487 --> 31:03.738
-let's go somewhere.
-No. Why?

31:03.821 --> 31:05.407
-So we can talk.
-I don't want to.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.074
I know this looks crazy,
but it's really not.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.993
It doesn't...
It doesn't matter.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.622
Frank Castle's going to take
the stand tomorrow.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.499
And your friend could use your help.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.584
That's all.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.422
Nice meetin' ya.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.018
- Fan club's here.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.104
Word must have gotten out
about Frank testifying.

31:37.188 --> 31:39.524
--Matt better show.

31:40.608 --> 31:43.027
If he doesn't, we'll survive.
Right?

31:58.460 --> 31:59.836
Karen, I'm so sorry about--

31:59.919 --> 32:02.464
Uh, Foggy wants to walk through
some things with you.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.680
Yeah, you wanted me here?

32:10.763 --> 32:11.806
Wow.

32:11.889 --> 32:13.182
Let's be clear.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.562
You're not here because
you're a better lawyer or person.

32:17.645 --> 32:21.190
You're here because you're almost as crazy
as Frank Castle, and that's it.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.109
So you called me here to insult me?

32:23.192 --> 32:25.987
I called you here to be useful,
for a change.

32:26.070 --> 32:28.573
We need to get Frank to tell his story
in a way that keeps him

32:28.656 --> 32:30.700
out of prison and alive.

32:30.783 --> 32:35.121
No one's heard that story except for you,
because you're who you are.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.957
Why don't you put all that torture
you put me and Karen through to good use?

32:38.040 --> 32:39.751
--Now would be the time.

32:39.834 --> 32:41.168
Counsel, we about ready?

32:41.252 --> 32:42.879
Uh, one more moment, Your Honor.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.549
Did you read the notes
from Schoonover and Lee?

32:46.633 --> 32:47.634
Yeah.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.051
Okay, here's the play.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.386
Walk Frank through his story.

32:50.470 --> 32:53.097
Connect the dots between the Colonel
and the neurologist.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.767
We don't have to prove
that Frank's version of events is true.

32:55.850 --> 32:58.310
We just have to convince the jury
that he believes it,

32:58.394 --> 32:59.687
and he relives it every day.

32:59.771 --> 33:02.273
We can put this guy in the loony bin,
where he belongs.

33:02.356 --> 33:03.775
- Counsel?
- Yeah.

33:03.858 --> 33:07.028
Uh, Your Honor, the Defense would like
to call Frank Castle to the stand.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.864
Bailiff, bring in the defendant, please.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.541
Tell me what's going on.

33:19.624 --> 33:22.293
Frank's wearing a suit.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.505
He looks better than I ever have,
and he's not even wearing a tie.

33:32.219 --> 33:34.889
--Order.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.355
Think about
what you want, Frank.

33:50.487 --> 33:53.032
-Something's not right.
-No turning back now.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.661
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

33:56.744 --> 33:58.245
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

33:58.329 --> 33:59.789
so help you God?

34:00.748 --> 34:01.874
Yeah.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.003
Please state your name
for the record.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.547
Frank Castle.

34:20.768 --> 34:24.355
Mr. Castle, you've been charged
with multiple capital crimes.

34:24.438 --> 34:28.818
Been called a killer incapable
of empathy or remorse.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.444
Hmm.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.112
Yeah.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.280
So I hear.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.324
Frank...

34:35.407 --> 34:37.034
May I call you Frank?

34:41.706 --> 34:42.873
Yeah.

34:42.956 --> 34:46.460
Frank, we've heard a lot about
neuro-chemistry...

34:46.543 --> 34:48.670
and psychology, and all things unfolding,

34:48.755 --> 34:51.257
scientifically and otherwise,
inside your brain.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.719
But I just have one question
I want to ask.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.723
What happened that day?

34:58.806 --> 35:01.558
The day your family
was so tragically killed.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.612
It's okay, Frank.

35:13.237 --> 35:15.572
- I understand, it's difficult.
- Do you?

35:17.533 --> 35:18.743
Do you understand?

35:20.494 --> 35:23.039
'Cause I don't think you understand shit.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.841
I'd like permission to treat the witness
as hostile, Your Honor?

35:33.925 --> 35:34.967
Granted.

35:35.051 --> 35:37.094
All right, Frank.

35:37.178 --> 35:39.931
You don't want to tell us?
I'll tell you.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.474
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what kind of man you are.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.020
You're the kind of man this city needs.

35:46.688 --> 35:49.732
Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we all know this city needs help.

35:49.816 --> 35:51.358
Needs it now.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.778
Not tomorrow, not next week,
not when the day comes,

35:53.861 --> 35:57.073
when the corruption that Wilson Fisk
left in his wake is flushed out for good,

35:57.156 --> 35:59.450
and the police force
is finally back on its feet.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.202
We need it now.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.705
'Cause this city's been sick.

36:04.706 --> 36:06.999
And the cops, they can't fix it alone,
they need...

36:07.083 --> 36:11.087
We all need men and women who are
willing to take the fight themselves.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.255
The kind of people who risk their lives

36:13.339 --> 36:15.842
so that we can walk safe at night
in our own neighborhoods.

36:15.925 --> 36:19.595
The ones our esteemed District Attorney
here is trying so hard to destroy.

36:19.679 --> 36:21.764
New York needs these people.

36:21.848 --> 36:24.684
We need... heroes.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.478
- Order.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.565
- The help they offer...

36:32.483 --> 36:34.360
...and the hope that they provide.

36:36.153 --> 36:39.907
Frank Castle wanted to help,
but he took it too far.

36:39.991 --> 36:42.159
He shot people, he killed people.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.535
It's against the law.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.622
And he broke that law many, many times.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.582
Now, I don't like him
any more than you do,

36:48.665 --> 36:50.877
but here's the thing,
he's not a common criminal.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.045
He's not malicious in intent.

36:53.129 --> 36:55.631
Frank Castle is actually a good man.
He just...

36:55.715 --> 36:58.134
He doesn't know the difference
between right and wrong anymore.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.011
And he doesn't need punishment for that.

37:00.094 --> 37:01.262
He needs help.

37:01.345 --> 37:02.638
Our help.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.894
That's the kind of man Frank Castle is.

37:10.062 --> 37:13.107
And now, you have to decide
what kind of jury you want to be.

37:15.526 --> 37:17.194
No further questions, Your Honor.

37:19.155 --> 37:20.281
Your, uh...

37:21.240 --> 37:22.366
Your Honor?

37:23.367 --> 37:24.786
Can I say something?

37:25.787 --> 37:27.204
You may.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.081
You know those, uh...

37:30.374 --> 37:32.376
Those people?

37:33.460 --> 37:36.088
The ones I put down, the people I killed?

37:37.548 --> 37:39.383
I want you to know
that I'd do it all again.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.718
--This is a circus, all right?

37:41.803 --> 37:43.637
It's a charade, it's an act.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.306
-It's bullshit about how crazy I am.
-Language.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.058
I ain't crazy!

37:47.141 --> 37:48.684
I'm not crazy.

37:48.768 --> 37:49.769
Okay?

37:50.770 --> 37:52.438
I know what I did.

37:54.065 --> 37:56.150
I know who I am.

37:56.233 --> 37:58.360
And I do not need your help.

38:01.113 --> 38:04.826
I'm smack-dab in the middle
of my right goddamn mind,

38:04.909 --> 38:06.493
and any scumbag, any...

38:06.577 --> 38:10.747
any lowlife, any maggot piece of shit
that I put down, I did it...

38:10.832 --> 38:12.541
-because I liked it!
-Order!

38:12.624 --> 38:15.669
Hell, I loved it! I'm sittin' here, I'm...
I'm just itching.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.130
--I'm itching to do it again.

38:18.214 --> 38:21.425
And you think... What, you think
you're gonna send me to a nuthouse?

38:21.508 --> 38:24.470
Some doctor, they're gonna get me to stop
from doing what I want to do?

38:24.553 --> 38:26.806
Well, that ain't happening!
Not on my watch!

38:27.890 --> 38:30.184
You people, you call me the Punisher,
ain't that right?

38:30.267 --> 38:31.435
The big bad Punisher.

38:31.518 --> 38:32.854
- Bailiff.
- Well, here I am!

38:32.937 --> 38:34.605
- Remove the witness.
- You want it, you got it!

38:34.688 --> 38:37.024
I am the Punisher!
I'm right here!

38:37.108 --> 38:39.026
You want it, I'll give it to you.

38:39.110 --> 38:42.905
And anybody who came here today
to hear me whine, to hear me beg?

38:42.989 --> 38:45.032
Well, you can kiss my ass!

38:45.741 --> 38:47.493
Do you hear me? I'm guilty.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.246
Come on, please, Judge!
I'm guilty, you hear me?

38:50.329 --> 38:52.331
I'm guilty! I'm guilty!

38:52.414 --> 38:55.376
I'll kill every one of 'em!
I'll kill every single one!

38:57.503 --> 38:58.754
How the hell did this happen?

38:58.838 --> 39:00.131
That wasn't the Frank
I met with yesterday.

39:00.214 --> 39:01.590
Guys...

39:01.673 --> 39:04.385
-I think somebody got to him.
-Convincing him of what?

39:04.468 --> 39:06.720
Yelling his way to multiple
life sentences?

39:06.803 --> 39:08.722
- You provoked him.
- What? I didn't...

39:08.805 --> 39:10.766
-What are you talking--
-I had it lined up for you.

39:10.850 --> 39:11.851
We could have done this.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.769
We could have gotten the charges reduced.

39:13.853 --> 39:16.105
All you had to do was get Frank
to tell his story.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.983
-Instead you veer off into vigilante-land!
-Foggy, he wasn't cooperating!

39:19.566 --> 39:20.567
I'm glad we lost.

39:20.651 --> 39:22.278
You hear me? I'm glad.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.820
-Foggy...
-Karen, let him go.

39:23.905 --> 39:24.906
I don't want to hear it.

39:24.989 --> 39:26.323
Karen, can I talk to you
for five seconds, please?

39:26.407 --> 39:28.492
I don't want to hear
another bullshit excuse!

39:29.368 --> 39:32.163
Maybe you are an alcoholic.
Maybe you're in a fight club.

39:32.246 --> 39:34.540
Maybe you are sleeping
with a whole harem of women.

39:34.623 --> 39:36.042
I don't care, I'm done.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.712
You're right.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.049
This city really needs heroes.

39:45.092 --> 39:46.302
But you're not one of them.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.730
You gotta feel like shit.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.358
Go back to bed.

40:03.819 --> 40:05.821
I can barely stand.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.033
Then go back to bed.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.540
No.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.339
I don't want to be with you anymore.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.300
I want to be with him.

40:26.842 --> 40:29.386
-Don't be stupid.
-He needs more training.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.887
The Hand is new to him--

40:30.972 --> 40:32.723
Soft.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.725
Matt Murdock is soft.

40:34.808 --> 40:36.310
He made you soft.

40:36.393 --> 40:39.230
You let your guard down.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.983
Go back to bed, Ellie.

40:42.066 --> 40:44.693
-I'm not a child.
-You can't be with him.

40:44.776 --> 40:45.861
Why?

40:48.697 --> 40:50.241
You can't change what you are.

40:50.324 --> 40:52.909
Matthew thinks I can.

40:52.994 --> 40:55.454
- And I believe him.

41:00.459 --> 41:01.793
Get out...

41:03.087 --> 41:04.463
before I get nasty.

41:04.546 --> 41:06.257
Are you threatening me?

41:06.340 --> 41:08.425
You're damn right, I am.

41:12.638 --> 41:13.805
Go.

41:20.062 --> 41:22.314
What do you think he'll say...

41:23.857 --> 41:25.901
when he finds out...

41:25.985 --> 41:27.403
what you are?

41:29.071 --> 41:30.697
What you've always been?

41:32.241 --> 41:34.951
Haven't told him yet...

41:35.036 --> 41:36.662
have ya?

41:39.581 --> 41:41.500
Get out.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.211
Aside from saving your ass...

41:46.505 --> 41:51.510
you have no idea
what I've protected you from.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.387
I can protect myself.

41:59.393 --> 42:00.936
We'll find out.

42:19.371 --> 42:23.542
Enough with these amateurs.
Time to get the band back together.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.086
Head to the Wall.

43:43.497 --> 43:44.790
Where's Stick?

43:47.543 --> 43:49.253
I made my choice.

43:50.546 --> 43:52.256
He didn't like it.

43:55.551 --> 43:57.761
I want to be with you.

43:59.180 --> 44:02.933
The only person in this world
who believes I'm good.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.121
You lost today.

44:26.873 --> 44:28.542
It doesn't matter.

44:31.795 --> 44:33.672
You lost more than just the case.

44:37.759 --> 44:38.760
Yeah.

44:38.844 --> 44:40.429
I didn't lose you.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.061
I'm sorry.

44:49.771 --> 44:51.022
I'm not.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.659
How does this work?

45:04.411 --> 45:05.704
You and me?

45:09.082 --> 45:10.917
How can we make it work?

45:11.918 --> 45:13.420
I don't know.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.591
But we're gonna figure it out.

45:21.177 --> 45:22.929
Not now, though.

45:27.559 --> 45:29.686
Right now, you need to rest.

48:02.589 --> 48:06.259
Who do you work for? Huh?

48:06.342 --> 48:08.470
Who sent you?

48:08.554 --> 48:10.722
Answer me! Huh?

48:12.265 --> 48:14.267
You tell them,
whoever they are,

48:14.350 --> 48:18.188
I'm gonna find them, and when I do,
I'm gonna--

48:23.359 --> 48:25.070
No...

48:25.153 --> 48:27.823
You're... You're just a kid.

48:30.033 --> 48:32.410
Elektra, no...
No...

48:51.722 --> 48:53.098
What did you do?

49:07.488 --> 49:09.531
This is who I am.

49:15.328 --> 49:17.330
Do you still want me?

49:23.003 --> 49:24.004
Matthew.

49:24.087 --> 49:26.339
- Matthew!

49:30.802 --> 49:32.971
You're okay...
You're okay...

49:45.233 --> 49:46.735
I got this one.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.028
On whose orders?

49:48.111 --> 49:50.822
The warden's.
You got a problem with that?

49:50.906 --> 49:53.033
No one tells us anything down here.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.599
Hey, look at me, Frank!
Look at me!

50:17.683 --> 50:19.100
I'm gonna stick you!

50:19.184 --> 50:21.477
--That's a promise!

50:21.562 --> 50:23.229
I promise you!

51:50.108 --> 51:51.234
Right through here.

52:41.409 --> 52:43.411
I see you got my message.
