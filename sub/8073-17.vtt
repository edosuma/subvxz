My God, what are these for?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.481
Oh, they just
hook them up and try

00:13.514 --> 00:15.449
to figure out which one of
your nipples is negative

00:15.483 --> 00:18.219
and which one's positive.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.020
- OK, how we doing?
- OK.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.055
Good, I hope.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.190
Well, we'll take
your first baby

00:22.223 --> 00:23.957
picture if you
just lay back here

00:23.991 --> 00:25.359
and lift up your blouse for me.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.894
Wow, just like
your prom picture.

Well, it's going to burn
like hell in a minute.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.305
Just kidding.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.206
Ew!

00:38.239 --> 00:40.308
Look at your belly button.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.209
Ew, it's so weird.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.710
Well, what happened?

00:42.743 --> 00:43.977
It's all-- what?

00:44.011 --> 00:45.079
Would you like
to see a picture

00:45.113 --> 00:46.080
of your baby, Miss Harris?

00:46.114 --> 00:46.914
My baby?

00:49.750 --> 00:50.984
Oh, it's beautiful!

00:51.018 --> 00:51.885
Isn't it?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.054
Look at the little feet!

00:54.088 --> 00:56.690
And the spine, and--
what's on its head?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.926
Looks like it's
wearing a little cap.

00:58.959 --> 00:59.893
Oh!

00:59.927 --> 01:03.164
That's what happened
to the condom.

Give me the remote.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.287
I'm not watching this.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.321
This is a commercial.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.589
You don't even know
what I'm watching.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.391
I know it's
something I'll hate.

02:03.424 --> 02:04.792

Come on, it's the finals!

02:14.134 --> 02:16.304
You know, big brothers
are supposed to look

02:16.337 --> 02:17.738
out for their kid brothers.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.441
And like, help them
and do stuff with them.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.675
Well, I'd have
done stuff with you.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.577
But you don't like
to do guy stuff.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.479
I like to do guy stuff.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.915
Who says drawing isn't
something guys do?

02:27.948 --> 02:28.749
Guys.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.488
I'm just as much
of a man as you are.

02:34.522 --> 02:38.892
Then how come the only
friend you ever had was a girl?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.394
Hey, Darlene was a
lot more like a guy

02:40.428 --> 02:41.462
when I first met her.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.402
DJ, who would you rather have
for a big brother, me or Mark?

02:48.436 --> 02:49.303
You.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.638
See?

02:50.671 --> 02:54.908
Because you can't beat me
up like Becky and Darlene can.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.312
Hey, that's the last one!

02:58.346 --> 03:01.782
Want it back?

03:01.815 --> 03:04.017
No, it's OK.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.359
Get out of my way!

03:11.392 --> 03:12.726
DJ, I'm sorry.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.828
It's just that I'm pregnant
right now and I'm very upset.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.796
What am I talking to you for?

03:15.829 --> 03:16.830
Get out of my way!

03:16.864 --> 03:17.731
Aahhh!

03:17.765 --> 03:19.800
Lookit.

03:19.833 --> 03:20.934
Look at that right now!

03:20.968 --> 03:22.670
Jackie, I know you've
slept with a lot of men,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.839
but I really don't need to know
all of their names right now.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.375
That is a legal document!

03:27.408 --> 03:30.978
Fred is suing me for
custody of my baby!

03:31.011 --> 03:32.780
Oh, my God.
You're kidding!

03:32.813 --> 03:33.814
No, it's all right there!

03:33.847 --> 03:35.182
He wants my baby!

03:35.215 --> 03:36.317
It's not even born yet!

03:36.350 --> 03:41.188
He's-- he's suing me for
custody of my stomach!

03:41.221 --> 03:42.122
Well, just calm down.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.291
Sit down here.
Come on.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.325
We'll figure something out.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.726
Well, I've already
thought about it

03:45.759 --> 03:47.395
and I think I've come up with
a plan that could really work.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.363
First, we hire a hit man.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.264
Jackie!

03:50.298 --> 03:51.765
Just hear me out!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.567
Because remember, we
saw that woman on TV

03:53.601 --> 03:55.669
who hired that guy for $500!

03:55.703 --> 03:59.807
And the reason she was on
TV is because she got caught!

03:59.840 --> 04:01.275
But I got to do something.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.676
He doesn't care about this baby.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.512
He's just doing this
to punish me because I

04:04.545 --> 04:05.613
won't go out with him.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.947
As far as I'm concerned,
he's just found

04:06.980 --> 04:08.382
a legal way to beat me up.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.018
Listen, Jackie, I'm not going
to let this happen to you, OK?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.620
I'm going to go and
I'll talk to him.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.356
Because deep down inside,
you and me both know

04:15.389 --> 04:17.358
that Fred is a decent guy.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.492
A decent guy?

04:18.526 --> 04:21.094
A decent guy doesn't sue
the mother of his child!

04:21.128 --> 04:22.763
There are no decent
guys in this world.

04:22.796 --> 04:23.664
There never have been.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.666
There never will be.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.634
That is not true.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
There's Dan.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.005
And-- Donahue.

04:32.039 --> 04:38.812
[music]

04:38.846 --> 04:41.749
Hey.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.017
Look at the way they
all scatter back

04:44.051 --> 04:46.286
to work when the boss walks in.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.021
You know, Dan, I
took your advice.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.057
And for the first time in
months I actually feel good

04:50.090 --> 04:50.958
about myself.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.326
Yeah.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.429
It's a dandruff shampoo, but
it keeps your hair manageable.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.666
No, I mean about suing
Jackie for custody.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.100
What the hell are
you talking about?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.168
I never told you to do that.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.235
Oh yes, you did.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.604
You remember last
week when Roseanne was

05:03.637 --> 05:04.972
having a big fight with you?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.441
You were telling me how a man's
got to stand up for himself.

05:07.475 --> 05:08.376
Well, that was different!

05:08.409 --> 05:09.377
I was sleeping on the couch.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.412
I had nothing to lose!

05:11.445 --> 05:12.846
Well, it made a
lot of sense to me.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.914
So I talked to a lawyer.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.616
He said you're right
to recommend suing.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.518
Would you stop saying that?

05:17.551 --> 05:19.286
Dan, you got nothing
to be ashamed of.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.788
I mean, I'd be proud
if it was my idea.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.689
That's good.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.091
We'll go with that.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.093
Hey, Dan, I tried
everything else.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.996
I don't want this kid to
grow up not knowing me.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.464
If it was your kid,
wouldn't you do anything

05:30.498 --> 05:32.466
to be a part of their life?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.367
Well, not now.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.069
But maybe before they were born.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.337
So you're on my side?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.305
No!

05:38.338 --> 05:39.373
But I understand your side.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.442
But I'm sure Jackie
has a side, too.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.342
Hey, Dan.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.243
Your wife's here.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.245
And here it comes now.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.179
I've got to get out of here.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.114
I'm going to sit this one out.

05:50.050 --> 05:50.918
[door closing]

05:50.951 --> 05:51.852
[knocking]

05:51.885 --> 05:53.554
Dan, if she
compliments my hair,

05:53.587 --> 05:55.389
can I tell her you did
recommend the dandruff shampoo?

05:58.592 --> 06:01.895
Fred, I want to
talk to you now.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.063
Alone.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.398
Well, not through
with my lunch yet.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.833
Well, you are now.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.269
Don't forget to brush.

06:09.302 --> 06:13.073
[paper crinkling]

06:13.106 --> 06:14.408
Save your breath, Roseanne.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.677
You're not going to talk me
into dropping this lawsuit.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.880
Well, maybe I can talk
into begging for your life.

06:19.913 --> 06:20.881
Is Dan in his office?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.282
No, he's not.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.084
We had a big crisis and Dan had
to rush out and take care of it

06:24.117 --> 06:25.085
right away.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.253
Oh yeah?

06:26.286 --> 06:28.321
What, did somebody forget
the crullers again?

06:28.355 --> 06:29.222
Now wait a minute.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.291
You can't--

06:31.324 --> 06:33.894
You wait a minute.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.631
Fred, you cannot sue Jackie.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.033
Before she went out with you
she went out with a whole bunch

06:40.067 --> 06:41.268
of really bad guys.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.670
Well, I'm sorry
about that, Roseanne.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.472
But why should I give a
damn about her feelings

06:44.505 --> 06:45.973
if she doesn't even
care about mine?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.008
You are not listening, OK?

06:48.041 --> 06:51.512
Her last boyfriend
used to beat her up.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.913
Oh, God.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.916
And it's not so easy to bounce
back from something like that.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.985
And you're not helping
anything by suing her!

06:58.018 --> 06:59.820
No.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.321
I feel awful about this.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.756
Well, yeah.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.691
I knew you would, Fred.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.593
Now listen.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.695
All you've got to do is
just drop the lawsuit.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.163
And then if you ask
really nice, I'm

07:10.197 --> 07:12.365
sure that Jackie and
I can be persuaded

07:12.399 --> 07:13.734
to share our baby with you.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.107
I'm not dropping it, Roseanne.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.843
So you would do this to Jackie
after what I just told you?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.012
I am not doing
anything to Jackie.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.547
I don't want to abandon my kid.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.881
He deserves a father.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.350
I told you before that I
will figure out a way for you

07:30.383 --> 07:31.451
to see your kid.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.721
I'm way more powerful
than any law!

07:37.558 --> 07:39.993
I'm tired of waiting for
you to handle this, Roseanne.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.997
From now on, I am fighting for
my rights and my kid's rights.

07:44.031 --> 07:44.898
Well.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.602
Dan and Donahue walk alone.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.703
Sorry, Roseanne.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.238
No, you're not sorry, Fred.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.472
But you are going to be.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.374
Because I can make your
life a living hell.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.644
You can't scare
me out of this.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.045
Well, maybe I can't.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.348
But Dan can, because Dan is the
kind of man who automatically

08:01.381 --> 08:02.616
defends all women.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.585
Because he knows how helpless
and vulnerable we are.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.987
And when he gets wind of the
crap you're trying to pull

08:07.020 --> 08:08.722
on my family, there's not
going to be a safe place

08:08.756 --> 08:10.558
on this earth for you to hide!

08:21.902 --> 08:24.872
Is that right, Dan?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.640
DAN: Well, in
here's pretty safe.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.610
[music]

08:29.643 --> 08:34.582
[music]

08:34.615 --> 08:36.850
David, can I talk
to you for a minute?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.753
I'd go to Mark, but he'd
just make fun of me.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.854
Sure, Deej.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.255
OK.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.424
Do you think it'd be weird if
I, like, took a home ec course?

08:48.428 --> 08:49.296
No.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.698
I think that's OK.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.900
So you don't think it's wrong
for a guy to learn how to cook

08:52.933 --> 08:54.902
and sew and stuff like that?

08:54.935 --> 08:55.903
Of course not.

08:55.936 --> 08:56.804
Thanks.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.271
Mark, you were right!

08:58.305 --> 08:59.272
David's a girl!

08:59.306 --> 09:02.743
David's a girl!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.477
Hey, I knew what
you were doing!

09:20.360 --> 09:21.294
[dan sighing heavily]

09:21.328 --> 09:23.764
Hey!

09:23.797 --> 09:25.899
Aw, hey to you, too.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.034
Where have you been?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.101
What, did you have to
work late or something?

09:28.135 --> 09:29.169
Yeah, a little overtime.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.403
And gee, you know,
when I was pulling up,

09:30.437 --> 09:32.272
I noticed the chimney's
got a big crack in it.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.174
I got to get to it right away.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.108
Could take me all night.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.678
Tape Gladiators
for me, will you?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.713
Oh, um, Dan?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.415
Did you get a chance to
talk to Fred today at all?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.316
Fred?

09:43.350 --> 09:44.217
Fred.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.285
Fred.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.453
Fred.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.354
No.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.090
No, I haven't seen Fred all day.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.627
He must be avoiding
me or something.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.897
Well, brace yourself here.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.833
Fred is suing Jackie
for custody of the baby.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.169
What?

10:02.202 --> 10:05.105
Oh, man.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.606
Oh, man!

10:06.640 --> 10:09.042
You've got to be
kidding me, right?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.812
Oh, man!

10:11.845 --> 10:13.613
And Dan, I know it
would be unfair to put

10:13.647 --> 10:14.514
you in the middle.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.084
So you'll be on my side.

10:17.117 --> 10:17.951
Oh, right.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.687
Like Fred would listen to me.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.755
Like anything I've ever
said has had any bearing

10:21.789 --> 10:24.224
at all on what Fred has done.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.059
Now, Dan, don't tell me
that you can't talk to him.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.828
I made a promise to Jackie.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.296
You are going to
have to decide whose

10:29.329 --> 10:33.901
happiness is more important
to you, Fred's or yours.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.235
What do you expect
me to do, Roseanne?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.104
I can't fire a city
employee because he's

10:37.137 --> 10:39.272
suing my sister-in-law.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.575
Well, you could if
he hijacked a city bus

10:42.609 --> 10:44.878
and handcuffed
himself to the wheel

10:44.912 --> 10:48.048
and then drove it right
off a cliff, couldn't you?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.549
It's between Fred and Jackie.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.884
I'm not getting involved.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.052
Well, you have
to get involved.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.220
Why?

10:53.253 --> 10:56.757
Because this will
eventually drive you insane.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.892
You can poke me until
I'm black and blue.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.327
I'm not changing my mind.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.962
Stop poking me!

11:01.995 --> 11:06.033
I can't believe you don't
like my sister more than this.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.667
Why don't you just leave
him alone, Mrs. Conner?

11:07.701 --> 11:08.869
Shut up.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.337
This can be done with a
steak knife too, you know!

11:10.370 --> 11:11.504
Don't blame Dan.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.639
You should be mad at me.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.776
It was really my idea
for Fred to sue Jackie.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.177
You mean, it
wasn't Fred's idea?

11:17.210 --> 11:20.547
I'm just saying it
wasn't Dan's idea.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.116
Why would you say it
wasn't Dan's idea?

11:23.150 --> 11:24.284
It was your idea!

11:27.855 --> 11:31.491
Now this is why you
don't talk very much.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.060
How could you do
something like this?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.394
Look, Roseanne, me
and you were having

11:34.427 --> 11:36.463
a big fight about Darlene.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.031
I was mad at every woman.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.667
Fred comes in, who knew
he'd take me seriously?

11:40.700 --> 11:41.969
OK, yeah.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.238
But now in the light of day,
after all the other males

11:45.272 --> 11:48.241
on Earth have decided that it's
your turn to use the brain,

11:48.275 --> 11:50.911
you can see the error
of your thinking, right?

11:50.944 --> 11:53.013
Hey, Roseanne, if you're
going to push me into a corner,

11:53.046 --> 11:56.049
I'll tell you
exactly what I think.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.251
I agree with Fred.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.719
And you agree with Fred, too?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.421
Damn right.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.257
Well, I mean, I agree with Dan.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.692
The guy's got rights.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.626
OK.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.763
So Jackie has so
far put in, what,

12:09.797 --> 12:11.331
eight months into this baby?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.966
And Fred?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.702
He put in-- what do you
think, three minutes?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.772
And I'm being very
generous here?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.141
And so you think that
they're equal partners

12:21.174 --> 12:22.442
in the deal, huh?

12:22.475 --> 12:24.077
Roseanne, the guy's
tried everything.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.781
He just wants to be a
part of his child's life.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.482
Maybe you have to be
a man to understand

12:29.516 --> 12:32.319
where we're coming from.
- Hey.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.220
Hey.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.054
Hey, David.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.490
OK.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.592
Now I want to ask
you a question, OK?

12:39.626 --> 12:43.596
And I want you to give me
a really honest answer.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.800
I agree with you, Mrs. Conner.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.068
Wait a minute.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.269
All right, David.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.270
Now.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.571
A man and a woman
who aren't married

12:51.604 --> 12:53.173
are going to have a baby.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.875
And the mother doesn't
want the father

12:54.908 --> 12:56.810
to have anything to do with it.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.511
Now, does she have that right?

12:58.545 --> 12:59.412
Well, yeah.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.413
I guess so.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.448
I mean, she is the mother.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.551
She's one that gave birth.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.154
OK.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.289
Good answer, David.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.390
He doesn't count.

13:10.423 --> 13:14.727
We said you have to be
a man to understand.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.730
Unless, of course,
the man wants rights.

13:17.764 --> 13:18.932
I mean, that, I think--

13:18.966 --> 13:20.433
the women should just
do what they're told.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.739
We should've known, Mom.

13:26.773 --> 13:31.211
Men stick together no matter how
butt-headed their argument is.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.881
Well, Dan, I guess you're just
not the man I thought you were.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.483
And I wasn't too
happy with that one!

13:42.789 --> 13:45.825
Well, men, looks like we're
on our own for dinner tonight.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.201
All right.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.702
But I'm not making
anything fancy.

13:59.072 --> 14:04.511
[music]

14:04.544 --> 14:05.979
So Mr. Conner.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.748
Are you and Mrs.
Conner talking yet?

14:08.781 --> 14:09.749
Well, let me see.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.783
We were in the
bathroom this morning.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.119
She shoved me.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.721
I believe she said move, so
technically we're speaking!

14:14.754 --> 14:17.390
Yeah, well, I don't care if
Becky ever speaks to me again.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.491
She's wrong.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.393
Little something I
think you ought to know.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.029
Women live longer than men.

14:22.062 --> 14:25.933
So in the end,
they're never wrong.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.800
No, I think if you just
tell the woman how you feel--

14:27.834 --> 14:28.635
You'd be one of them.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.472
There's nothing
wrong with talking

14:32.505 --> 14:34.274
about your feelings, Mark.

14:34.307 --> 14:38.145
Hey, look, it's the
eighth dwarf, Wimpy.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.980
You don't buy this
crap, do you, Mr. Conner?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.382
Well, boys, let me tell you
how I keep Roseanne happy.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.254
You didn't think I
was serious, did you?

14:50.057 --> 14:53.860
Well, Mark, I think you should
tell Becky what you just said.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.761
What?

14:54.794 --> 14:56.997
What did he say?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.298
Look, Becky.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.766
Mark only took Fred's
side because he

14:59.799 --> 15:01.368
thinks he has to act tough.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.538
But he's actually a lot more
sensitive than you think.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.640
Shut up, Raggedy Ann.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.242
I see what you mean, David.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.410
No, it's hard
for him to tell you

15:10.443 --> 15:11.578
this because it's
the kind of thing

15:11.611 --> 15:12.812
that guys only
admit to other guys.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.015
But he's jealous.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.183
Jealous?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.317
About what?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.351
I'm not jealous.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.352
Don't worry.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.422
Come on, she won't
think you're weak.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.856
Yeah, he's jealous.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.626
All guys are jealous
because we can't have babies

15:26.659 --> 15:27.760
and we all really want to.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.966
No, David, not that!

15:33.000 --> 15:34.534
Not the biggest secret of all!

15:38.105 --> 15:38.972
Oh!

15:39.006 --> 15:41.841
That makes so much sense.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.076
You really said that?

15:48.781 --> 15:52.752
Yeah, well, those
weren't my exact words.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.022
Why didn't you talk to
me about these things?

15:55.055 --> 15:56.823
I'd understand.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.091
Want to talk now?

15:58.125 --> 15:58.925
Sure.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.264
So.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.599
Who's the wimp now?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.135
I don't know.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.302
Let's trade punches and see.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.242
I hate you.

16:15.275 --> 16:24.484
[music]

16:24.517 --> 16:25.952
Hi, Roseanne.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.720
Oh, you!

16:27.754 --> 16:28.621
Out of my diner.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.689
I changed my mind.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.025
I'm dropping the lawsuit.
- Really?

16:32.059 --> 16:32.925
Yeah.

16:32.959 --> 16:33.993
I thought about what you said.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.628
I still think I'm
right, but I don't want

16:35.662 --> 16:37.297
to put Jackie through this.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.565
Oh.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.566
Well.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.834
Took you long enough.

16:41.868 --> 16:42.669
I knew you'd be pleased.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.141
What the hell
is he doing here?

16:48.175 --> 16:50.077
He came here to
do evil but he was

16:50.110 --> 16:54.281
drawn into my circle of love.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.650
He's going to drop the lawsuit.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.320
I'll drop it if you're
willing to be reasonable

17:00.353 --> 17:02.555
and at least let me
see the baby some.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.860
Jackie, this is where
you say thank you.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.229
Why the hell
should I thank him?

17:09.262 --> 17:10.330
No thank me!

17:10.363 --> 17:13.566
I'm the one that pulled
the whole thing off.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.001
You don't see what
he's doing, Roseanne?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.569
What?
What am I doing?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.871
You're dropping it so I'll
think you're a really great guy

17:18.905 --> 17:20.173
and agree to go
out with you again.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.542
When are you going to
accept the fact that I don't

17:22.575 --> 17:23.843
want anything to do with you?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.313
When are you going to accept
the fact that I accepted

17:26.346 --> 17:28.315
that fact a long time ago?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.383
I just want to see my
kid once in a while.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.186
Yeah, well once in a while
turns into all the time.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.754
And who do you see when
you're seeing the baby?

17:34.787 --> 17:35.722
Me.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.124
And you end up
attached to my life.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.958
It's so obvious!

17:38.991 --> 17:42.362
OK, so let me get
this straight here.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.963
When Fred was suing
you, that's because he

17:43.996 --> 17:45.398
wants to be with you, right?

17:45.432 --> 17:46.599
And then and he
drops the lawsuit,

17:46.633 --> 17:49.202
that's because he wants
to be with you too, right?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.003
So everything on Earth
that Fred ever does

17:51.037 --> 17:52.839
is because he wants
to be with you.

17:52.872 --> 17:53.673
Yes.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.010
Well, you better
hope that kid's

17:58.044 --> 18:01.514
head ain't as big as yours.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.050
Listen, Jackie,
try and get this, OK?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.818
I don't want you.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.054
I don't want anything
to do with you.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.289
I wouldn't go out
with you if you

18:09.322 --> 18:11.958
were the last pregnant
woman on earth.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.294
Oh.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.829
See you in court.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.331
Let the jerk go.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.700
He's not a jerk, OK?

18:20.733 --> 18:24.003
Now look, I know you've had
bad relationships, you know,

18:24.036 --> 18:25.305
and you've hurt a
lot and everything.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.039
But God, get a grip!

18:27.073 --> 18:29.041
I am completely gripped.

18:29.075 --> 18:29.976
Look.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.144
He's trying to do
something decent

18:31.178 --> 18:32.279
and you just treat
him like crap.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.013
Oh, well, now I
see what's going on.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.382
I'm not getting
together with Fred.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.549
No.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.385
I know you're not getting
together with Fred.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.254
Fred is gone, for good.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.356
But if you don't snap out this
man-hating stuff of yours,

18:43.390 --> 18:44.857
you're going to be old
and alone and thinking

18:44.891 --> 18:47.994
you can stay with me!

18:48.027 --> 18:50.630
I can't believe you're
saying this to me!

18:50.663 --> 18:52.199
You don't know what
I went through!

18:52.232 --> 18:54.334
You think you can just say
snap out of it and poof,

18:54.367 --> 18:55.368
I'm over it?

18:55.402 --> 18:58.037
No!

18:58.070 --> 19:00.240
They're not all like Fisher, OK?

19:00.273 --> 19:01.474
They're not all like Dad.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.315
I'll make my own
decisions, Roseanne.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.485
If you can't back me
up, then screw you!

19:12.519 --> 19:15.955
No, screw you!

19:15.988 --> 19:18.858
Now I have to go home and
get into a great big fight

19:18.891 --> 19:20.927
with Dan over nothing because
you're so totally wrong!

19:20.960 --> 19:21.761
So screw you double!

19:25.031 --> 19:28.735
I'll call you tomorrow!

19:28.768 --> 19:29.636
Shut up!

19:29.669 --> 19:35.908
[music]

19:35.942 --> 19:37.277
[music]

19:37.310 --> 19:39.579
Am I still mad?

19:39.612 --> 19:42.081
Well, Roseanne, I guess you
did have kind of a point

19:42.114 --> 19:44.116
about me having
problems with men.

19:44.150 --> 19:48.355
And you are my sister
and you do love me.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.790
So, yeah, I'm still mad.

19:50.823 --> 19:51.691
All right.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.525
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.667
[fred chuckling]

20:00.700 --> 20:02.969
So we made love twice
in the last nine months.

20:03.002 --> 20:03.936
I think we're on a roll.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.438
I forgot how nice it could be.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.639
I just hope this
time I don't throw

20:06.673 --> 20:09.276
up for the next four months.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.177
So how come you didn't tell
Roseanne that what she said

20:11.210 --> 20:12.479
got us together?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.614
Oh, because me and Dan have
a bet to see who can make

20:14.647 --> 20:15.882
Roseanne apologize the most.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.720
That's just mean.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.589
I kind of like this family.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.757
Now I know what I was
doing wrong all those months.

20:24.791 --> 20:25.958
I was being nice.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.927
No, I like that
you're a nice guy.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.096
I just finally decided
not to let another one

20:30.129 --> 20:31.464
slip through my fingers.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.401
Then how come after eight
months of candy and flowers,

20:34.434 --> 20:36.303
I got nowhere until I sued you?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.870
You liked it when I
played a little hardball.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.838
No.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.474
I was angry and
hurt and disgusted.

20:41.508 --> 20:45.712
But then Dan explained it to me.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.879
What do you mean?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.214
He told me that
the only reason

20:48.247 --> 20:49.549
that you were suing
me for custody

20:49.582 --> 20:51.017
was because you were jealous.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.018
Jealous?

20:52.051 --> 20:53.420
Yeah.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.489
That you can't have a baby.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.725
I didn't know men
felt like that.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.160
We don't.

21:01.193 --> 21:04.531
That's about the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.299
Dan said you'd say that.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.504
Fred, I don't think you're weak.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.940
[smooching]

21:13.973 --> 21:17.009
Yeah, well.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.978
You know, it was a really
tough thing for me to admit.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.550
And I think it's
really good that you

21:23.583 --> 21:26.919
men talk about these things,
at least with each other.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.022
Did Dan tell you he
cried when I told him?

21:30.056 --> 21:40.099
[theme music]

21:40.099 --> 21:48.608

21:48.641 --> 21:51.010
