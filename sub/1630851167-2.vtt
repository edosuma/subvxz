-[Lucifer and Chloe laugh]

00:21.688 --> 00:24.482
[Lucifer laughs] Oh, no, no. Oh. Oh!

00:24.566 --> 00:26.693
-Oh!
-[Chloe] No.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.195
[mutters, laughs]

00:29.279 --> 00:30.697
[Lucifer grunts] There's more!

00:30.780 --> 00:32.949
-[Chloe laughs]
-[Lucifer panting]

00:33.033 --> 00:38.121
-[Chloe panting] Oh, God.
-[grunts] Not quite yet, but…

00:38.204 --> 00:40.832
-That was something else.
-[both sigh]

00:40.915 --> 00:43.793
-A good something else?
-Oh, absolutely. [chuckles]

00:43.877 --> 00:45.420
I never thought Amenadiel's rod

00:45.503 --> 00:48.048
being used in my sex life
would be such a great thing.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.341
[both laugh]

00:50.425 --> 00:52.761
And I never thought
that your invulnerability

00:52.844 --> 00:55.180
-would have such extensive benefits.
-[panting]

00:55.263 --> 00:58.183
If I'd known all I had to do was love you,

00:58.266 --> 01:01.394
and that the simple act of loving you
would make me feel worthy of you,

01:01.478 --> 01:04.856
which would then mean my body would
no longer have to tell my unconscious mind

01:04.939 --> 01:05.774
to be vulnerable,

01:05.857 --> 01:09.360
allowing us to have no-holds-barred
sex all night long, well, then…

01:10.779 --> 01:12.697
I would have done it
much sooner. [chuckles]

01:12.781 --> 01:15.658
-[elevator bell dings]
-Speaking of…

01:15.742 --> 01:16.826
[Amenadiel] Lucifer!

01:17.744 --> 01:19.579
Would it kill you to knock?

01:19.662 --> 01:21.831
Your door is an elevator!

01:22.791 --> 01:25.293
[Lucifer] Deary me. So,

01:26.753 --> 01:29.297
how's it hanging, big guy? Oh. [chuckles]

01:30.173 --> 01:32.383
-[continues chuckling]
-[sighs]

01:33.802 --> 01:36.012
Your return to Heaven has been requested.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.515
Oh, the more things change. [chuckles]

01:39.099 --> 01:41.851
You said this was
the morning you would ascend.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.188
-Did I?
-Yet here you are, in bed, scantily clad.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.191
Talk about things not changing?

01:50.443 --> 01:51.444
[exhales]

01:52.153 --> 01:54.030
It's time, Lucy.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.618
Time for you to assume
your place on Father's throne.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.995
[Chloe] Amenadiel, what's the rush?

02:01.746 --> 02:03.665
Oh. What she said.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.459
The world needs a God.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.462
[Chloe] Yeah, but your dad was
on Earth for, what, a few months,

02:09.546 --> 02:10.588
and everything was fine.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.466
Father may not have been in Heaven,
but he was still God.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.387
[Chloe] And Lucifer's been here for weeks.
And look, is the universe collapsing?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.139
Are frogs falling from the sky?

02:19.222 --> 02:21.474
No. Not that we know of.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.893
And, if the universe were to fall apart,

02:23.977 --> 02:26.604
don't you think you,
of all angels, would know first?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.066
I suppose you're right.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.028
Still, what is he waiting for?

02:34.612 --> 02:38.408
Well, becoming God is a big job.
Maybe he doesn't wanna go in half-cocked.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.577
I should definitely be full-cocked.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.747
Chloe, it's a little too late
to say he's not ready.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.041
We just fought a war for him.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.544
Well, technically,
I did most of the fighting.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.255
Amenadiel.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.675
Have a little faith in your brother.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.635
He'll get there.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.887
He always does.

03:01.806 --> 03:02.974
Right, Lucifer?

03:05.059 --> 03:07.145
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.106
Don't worry,
I know just what I need to do.

03:11.774 --> 03:15.111
[exhales] I need you
to tell me what to do.

03:15.737 --> 03:18.448
You need me
to tell you what to do to be God?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.075
Exactly. Well, you helped me
with my troubles being the Devil.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.746
-Why should the reverse be any different?
-Thought I wasn't your therapist anymore.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.707
[hesitates] And look at what's happened.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.169
The world has no God.
Clearly I belong on this couch.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.713
Okay, so what is the problem?

03:33.796 --> 03:37.592
Well, I have seven billion problems
and only love one.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.969
Mm-hmm. What?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.930
Well, in order to be God, apparently,

03:42.013 --> 03:44.766
I need to care about
all the humans on the planet.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.059
An impossible feat,

03:46.142 --> 03:49.687
seeing as I find a large majority
of the human race to be insufferable.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.732
Then I was thinking,
Doctor, you help people…

03:52.815 --> 03:55.068
I'd like to think I do, yes.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.653
I've seen some of your patients.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.322
[chuckles] I mean,
talk about mouth-breathers.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.909
So, how is it possible that
you're able to care about all of them?

04:03.993 --> 04:06.204
Well, being a good therapist is about

04:06.287 --> 04:08.623
taking your own opinions
out of the equation.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.500
-Hmm.
-Listening without bias.

04:10.583 --> 04:14.045
-Hmm.
-Keeping personal feelings to yourself.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.006
-Oh, I think I understand.
-Probably not.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.259
You don't care about your patients at all.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.428
-That's definitely not what I was saying.
-So what you're saying is,

04:22.512 --> 04:25.765
I need to be able
to help people that I don't care about.

04:26.432 --> 04:30.270
If I prove I can do that,
then I'll prove I can be God.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.064
Well, I suppose you've had worse ideas.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.524
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.234
You know,

04:37.193 --> 04:40.530
you really do have
a very special way of helping me.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.366
-[Linda] Hmm. Hmm.
-Amazing. [inhales]

04:46.577 --> 04:47.870

Really?

I mean, I got a long way to go
before I reach Michelle Yeoh level, but…

05:58.858 --> 06:01.986
Oh, it's just so fun,
you know, to learn all the moves.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.279
And then you got kicks.

-Don't worry. I drop stuff all the time.

[Carol] Okay.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.029

06:45.113 --> 06:47.323
Nope. Body was called in anonymously.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.368
Oh. All right.
Uh, I'll put a trace on the number.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.413
I'll grab whatever footage I can
from CCTV cameras in the area.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.706
And what was the cause of death again?

06:55.790 --> 06:56.874
Well…

06:58.209 --> 07:00.044
must have been one angry woman.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.463

07:48.259 --> 07:50.511

what you're trying to do here,

07:51.429 --> 07:52.472
whatever that is,

07:52.555 --> 07:55.850
but like I told you at the crime scene,
don't need your help.

07:55.933 --> 07:59.520
Well, unfortunately for both of us,
I need you to need my help, so,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.981
come on, let me be
the answer to your prayers.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.860
I promise you, I am all good.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.446
[sighs] I didn't wanna
have to do this, but…

08:09.447 --> 08:10.865
one last time before I'm God.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.366

08:12.450 --> 08:14.952
what is it you truly desire?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.959

08:22.043 --> 08:24.337
Oh. Did not have you as the complex type.

But come on… [snaps fingers]

08:26.339 --> 08:28.424

08:30.843 --> 08:34.138
[exhales] I want someone
I can spend the rest of my life with.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.932
Someone who loves me for who I am.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.769
Somebody I can wake up next to in
the morning and just totally connect with.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.189
Oh, I see. You want sex.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.482
No! What? No!

08:44.565 --> 08:46.234
Well, you are in luck, my friend,

because you are looking
at a literal sex god.

-One determined to help you get laid.
-[laughs] Yeah, no, I am pretty sure

08:52.240 --> 08:54.367

to find the right person.

Hmm.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.370
Besides, if I've gone this long…

08:57.453 --> 09:00.414
Oh, I see. I mean, I get a bit squirrelly
myself after a dry patch.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.749
How long's it been exactly?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.835
I-- I don't know, 14, maybe 15--

09:04.919 --> 09:06.379
Days? Oh, that's awful.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.464
Months.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.882
Fifteen months?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.425
Shh!

09:11.509 --> 09:13.344
How can you even walk properly?

09:13.427 --> 09:16.847
Yeah, thank future me I'm here. We need
to remedy this situation immediately.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.685
I do not understand what is happening
right now, but I can tell you this,

09:20.768 --> 09:22.853
I don't need your help to have sex.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.773
Uh, I could just come back later.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.943
Um, no, Ella, we were just, uh, talk--

-[growls]
-[chuckles]

09:30.236 --> 09:31.862
Uh, I'm sorry. What's up?

09:32.446 --> 09:36.826
Um, well, we got the CCTV footage
back from the crime scene.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.789
Uh, the actual murder took place
out of frame, but we did get this.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.420
-Huh. Is she carrying--
-Bags.

09:47.503 --> 09:51.465
And the names on those bags
are all brand names of shoes.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.134
Well, the running is very suspicious.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.137
Yeah, especially because
the COD was a stiletto to the neck.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.263

09:57.346 --> 09:59.098
Already done. Kate Jacobs.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.266
And guess what.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.769
Her phone number matches
the one in the victim's burner.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.772
Okay. Looks like I got a date
with the shoe lady. [claps]

10:06.856 --> 10:09.025
[snaps fingers] Not a date. Uh, it is a…

10:09.108 --> 10:11.861

with the shoe lady.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.541
Thank you, Lucifer. So much.

10:26.167 --> 10:30.838
Now, if you'll please excuse me,
like I said, I do not need your help.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.716
I need your help. [sighs]

10:33.799 --> 10:37.970
Oh, yeah. Come in.
I'm going a little stir crazy, actually.

10:38.054 --> 10:42.516
It's taking a while for Lucifer
to start running the family business.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.976
And it's fine. I trust him.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.687
I'm just not used to having
this much time on my hands.

10:47.688 --> 10:49.315
Anyhow, what's up?

10:49.398 --> 10:53.986
Uh, it's that guy. Carol.
You know, Detective Corbett.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.655
It's just, uh…

10:55.738 --> 10:58.824
It's just that, you know,
well, he's nice. Okay?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.618
Maybe a little too nice.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.204
And suspiciously normal,

11:03.287 --> 11:06.123
and it's just-- I mean,
he's just too good to be true.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.875
You like him. Aw.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.127
No, no, no "aw."

11:10.211 --> 11:13.047
Okay, I mean, I love kung fu movies, okay?

11:13.130 --> 11:15.675
And apparently,
he loves kung fu movies too,

11:15.758 --> 11:18.260
but I mean, he's clearly
lying to manipulate me, right?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.555
I mean, what are the chances
we both like the same thing?

11:21.639 --> 11:24.975
Um, well, you pretty much like everything,
Ella, so pretty high.

11:25.893 --> 11:30.898
Okay, fine, but he's also
just super cute and insanely polite,

11:30.981 --> 11:32.233
says all the right things,

11:32.316 --> 11:36.278
and he picked up my bag.

11:36.821 --> 11:37.738
Who does that?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.366
He reminds you of Pete, huh?

11:40.449 --> 11:41.450
[sighs]

11:42.243 --> 11:47.998
It's just really hard to trust someone
after your last BF was an SK.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.626
Serial killer.

11:53.003 --> 11:56.090
Well… [clears throat]
Carol isn't a serial killer.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.801
-And he was one of Dan's best friends.
-Yeah!

11:58.884 --> 12:01.846
But you didn't know that Pete was
a serial killer and neither did Dan.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.391
Right. Good point. Well, what would help?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.228
I don't know.
Knowing every single thing about him.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.314
You're saying you wanna investigate?

12:12.398 --> 12:13.566
What?

12:13.649 --> 12:17.486
You mean, like, stalk him on Facebook
or see if he's on Instagram?

12:17.570 --> 12:22.116
No, no. I'm thinking more along the lines
of the, uh, precinct personnel files.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.534
Oh!

12:23.617 --> 12:26.537
I-- I don't know about that.
I mean, I-- I just…

12:26.620 --> 12:28.330
Maybe I just overreacted.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.375
No, no, no. It's good.
It's good to do a little recon.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.627
You have to know what you're getting into.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.795
-Come on.
-Right.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.096
I didn't kill him.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.973
I sell designer accessories.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.808
He was my best client.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.726
Okay.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.229
So if you didn't kill him,

12:52.313 --> 12:54.607
why did you run
from the scene of the crime?

12:54.690 --> 12:57.485
Well, we were supposed
to be meeting up for a sale,

12:57.568 --> 13:00.321
but when I got there, I found him dead.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.406
I panicked.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.700
I mean, I still called it in, though.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.204
[Lucifer] What a stand-up citizen,
wouldn't you agree, Detective Corbett?

13:08.954 --> 13:09.955
Who is that?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.082
That's nobody.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.083
Please ignore him.

13:13.876 --> 13:18.214
So, if the victim was
one of your best clients,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.634
why didn't you wait
for the police to arrive?

13:21.717 --> 13:22.718
I mean, unless

13:23.844 --> 13:25.179
your goods are stolen.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.516
[exhales] I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

13:28.599 --> 13:32.228
[Lucifer] What you cannot deny
is the chemistry between you two.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.064
[laughs] Seriously, who is that?

[Lucifer] This is the voice of God.

13:39.193 --> 13:43.280

please get out of there.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.658

so as you wish.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.662

13:50.329 --> 13:53.457
Lucifer, that was not
an invitation for you to come in here.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.875
Leave, please.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.920
Assertive yet polite.
An attractive combo, wouldn't you say?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.505
I am so sorry about this.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.382
Also thoughtful and sensitive.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.343
It makes you wanna jump
his bones, doesn't it? [chuckles]

14:04.426 --> 14:06.595
What is going on here?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.473
I am here to facilitate a love connection.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.976
-I know you two have so much in common.
-Shh!

14:12.059 --> 14:16.897
Kate, you are a criminal,
and Carol here catches criminals.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.232
So, see? Perfect.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.443
She is a person of interest
in a murder investigation.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.696
-So you're saying you're interested?
-[Kate] No, whoa!

14:23.779 --> 14:26.866
-I'm not still in trouble, am I?
-Well, that depends, Miss Jacobs.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.201
Do you have any information
that could be useful to us?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.620
Maybe the name of the victim,
for starters.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.248
I have his first name. Fred.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.877
I don't ask a lot of my clients,
just that they pay in cash.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
-Of course. [chuckles]
-Of course.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.216
Uh, can you think of anything else?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.554
Oh, well, Fred was always
buying this woman Fiona shoes.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.724
But lately I've been hearing
about another woman.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.310
In fact, I actually
heard them arguing on the phone.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.520
And she sounded jealous.

14:56.604 --> 15:00.149
Hmm.
Messy love triangle, speaks to a motive.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.610
Uh, do you know
the other woman's name, by any chance?

15:02.693 --> 15:03.736
Busty.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.406
It's a weird name, right?
That's why I remember it.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.324
Wait.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.078
I know a drag queen named Busty
who performs at Hamburger Mary's.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.165
Busty Bazoongas.
There can't be two of those.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.083
-[laughs] Pun intended.
-[Carol] Okay.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.087
Well, it fits with high-end accessories,
and it is the only lead we have.

15:22.171 --> 15:26.508
Miss Jacobs, you are free to go, as long
as your alibi checks out, of course.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.011
-[Kate] Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.764
See?

15:31.847 --> 15:33.140
You helped me, buddy.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.101
So, thank you and

15:37.186 --> 15:38.020

Come on, Marty,
just try my badge one more time.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.082
Miss Decker,
you are no longer a detective.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.626
And, Lopez, you don't have access.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.004

I am Detective Carol Corbett, LAPD.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.956
I'm actually here
to ask a couple of questions.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.834
Um, could you tell me where a Miss…

fighting with Fred right before he died.

-And-- and he did it for three years.
-Mm. Two years.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.669
Looks like he took,
uh, a year off after vice.

22:18.545 --> 22:19.421
Wait a second.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.675
You're saying that after he was
a professional liar, he just vanished?

22:24.509 --> 22:27.304
Chloe, that's even worse.
Who knows what he was doing?

22:27.387 --> 22:30.349
Well, working undercover
can be extremely stressful.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.768
He probably just took
some time off to decompress.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.770
-Cops do it all the time.
-[sighs]

22:34.853 --> 22:38.315
Ella, I hate to say it, I just don't think
there's anything left to investigate here.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.234
[sighs]

22:43.362 --> 22:45.947
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.536
[Busty] Well, did you find the killer?

22:51.620 --> 22:55.290
It seems that you are
the main suspect at the moment.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.377
Say what now?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.671
Look, in Busty's defense,
I did hear Fiona was a bit of a bitch.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.842
Yeah, Fiona was a raging ball of a bitch,
but she became my mentor.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.346
I've always been
something of a comedy queen.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.223
And lately I've been working on

23:12.599 --> 23:14.017
serving more fish.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.187
-Hmm?
-Upping her beauty game.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.480
Oh.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.233
Nobody does Glamazon like Fiona Fierce.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.567
[chuckles]

23:22.651 --> 23:25.237
She was helping me
revamp my entire drag persona.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.243
She even gave me this--
this really cute pair of heels.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.369
Oh.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.287
From Kate?

23:34.371 --> 23:35.288
Yeah.

23:35.372 --> 23:39.501
Kate told us that she heard
you and Fiona arguing on the phone.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.586
Oh, we argued like trailer trash

23:41.670 --> 23:45.048
in a Walmart parking lot
on Black Friday. [laughs]

23:45.132 --> 23:46.425
And for good reason.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.931
[sighs] Everybody sees drag
as this pinnacle of self-discovery,

23:53.014 --> 23:56.309
that once you've found
this world, this life, that's it.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.769
You're supposed to be this

23:59.104 --> 24:02.107
fierce idol that's got it
all figured out. Godlike.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.900
Almost.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.404
Owning oneself
down to the last manicured nail.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.450
But confidence is
a work in progress. I mean,

24:11.533 --> 24:13.994
when is anyone's chicken
ever fully cooked?

24:14.661 --> 24:15.745
You know what I mean?

24:16.329 --> 24:17.164
Yes.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.082
Drag saved me.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.878
This makeup,
this jewelry, this is my armor.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.088
And Fiona helped me see that

24:25.672 --> 24:30.093
even though the paint can give strength,
it still has to come from within.

24:30.844 --> 24:34.264
I think I was holding part of myself back
'cause I was afraid that…

24:35.098 --> 24:37.976
well, that if I put
too much effort into being--

24:38.894 --> 24:40.937
it sounds stupid, a pretty queen--

24:42.481 --> 24:45.942
that people would laugh at me,
and not in a good way.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.905
But if we're gonna
change the world, and, hunty,

24:51.281 --> 24:52.115
we are…

24:52.199 --> 24:53.033
[Lucifer exhales]

24:53.116 --> 24:56.578
…queens like me gotta
work on facing all of our fears,

24:57.412 --> 24:58.747
and knowing we're enough.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.709
If you don't mind me asking, uh,

25:02.792 --> 25:06.129
what exactly were you
and Fiona arguing about?

25:06.213 --> 25:08.006
Fiona was pushing me.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.716
I didn't always wanna hear it.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.344
But I knew what she was saying.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.221
Yes.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.476
I am Busty Bazoongas. [chuckles]

25:22.562 --> 25:26.316
But until I can look within and own that,

25:27.651 --> 25:28.818
I will never be--

25:28.902 --> 25:31.321
Who you're truly meant to be.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.239
Yeah.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.826
And we truly wanna find the killer.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.704
Good luck on that one. [chuckles]

25:39.788 --> 25:41.790
As I said, Fiona's list of enemies

25:41.873 --> 25:45.710
was as long
as my luxurious wig. [chuckles]

25:45.794 --> 25:49.005
Okay, well, at least
I have the full legal name now.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.341
I can get into financials and emails--

25:51.424 --> 25:54.135
Well, maybe you and Busty
can do that together.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.137
Over a candlelit dinner.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.474
[exhales] Oh! Okay, I'm flattered.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.394
-And you-- you are adorable.
-[chuckles]

26:02.477 --> 26:06.398
But I'm afraid this queen's
long-term beau would object.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.440
[chuckles] Right.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.484
[Busty chuckles] Yeah.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.655
Oh, look, don't give up hope quite yet.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.533
Maybe the hostess is single.
She seemed taken with you.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.953
Sure, and she's great,
but not what I'm looking for.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.914
Okay, well, just because
I don't care about you doesn't mean

26:22.998 --> 26:25.667
you can't care about somebody,
so what are you looking for?

26:25.750 --> 26:29.754
[sighs] I don't know.
Uh, somebody with a great heart,

26:29.838 --> 26:32.757
who's kind and smart and gives great hugs

26:32.841 --> 26:35.135
-and has amazing T-shirts--
-Wait, h-hang on.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.929
-What?
-You're describing Miss Lopez.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.431
[scoffs] No, I'm not.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.348
[chuckles]

26:40.932 --> 26:43.476
Okay, fine, I am, but don't say anything.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.688
Okay, because pretty sure
she doesn't think of me like that.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.898
Of course she doesn't.
You're monochromatic,

26:48.982 --> 26:51.401
and I'm not just
talking about your clothes.

26:51.484 --> 26:55.238
But I have good news for you.
I happen to know Miss Lopez very well,

26:55.322 --> 26:57.991
which means I'm ideally
qualified to help you transform

26:58.074 --> 27:00.452
into the kind of man
she would be interested in.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.662
-Mm-hmm.
-Let me be your Fiona.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.205
Great.

27:05.206 --> 27:06.791
Wait, no! What?

27:06.875 --> 27:11.171
-[rock music playing]
-♪ Pull me under ♪

27:20.639 --> 27:21.973
Um, excuse me.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.727
You're excused.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.437
[nurse] Hey!

27:27.520 --> 27:30.148
Who are you?
Did you escape from your room?

27:30.940 --> 27:32.400
[scoffs] Chill, Ratched.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.611
I'm not a damned soul.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.780
Oh, well, you're not a demon.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.241
Ding, ding. You are correct.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.495
Look, I was just on a break
and I kind of have to get back,

27:43.578 --> 27:47.290
but whoever you are,
you're really not supposed to be here.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.250
[chuckles]

27:50.418 --> 27:51.628
Seriously!

27:52.796 --> 27:55.131
You are really not supposed to be here.

28:00.428 --> 28:01.805
You're an angel?

28:02.472 --> 28:04.933
I don't understand. Who are you?

28:05.892 --> 28:07.435
What are you doing here?

28:11.356 --> 28:12.440
Came to see him.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.821
Michael!

28:17.904 --> 28:19.447
Oh, uh, um…

28:20.115 --> 28:23.034
Sorry.
Nobody's allowed to talk to the prisoner.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.703
Something I can help you with?

28:24.786 --> 28:28.289
Sure, wanna help me
destroy Lucifer Morningstar?

28:35.130 --> 28:37.590
-Yeah, I didn't think so.
-Wait, wait!

28:38.174 --> 28:39.801
You don't want Michael's help.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.594
He failed. Badly.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.931
Epically is more like it.
And that's why I wanna talk to him.

28:45.014 --> 28:48.143
I need to know what he did wrong,
so I don't make the same mistakes.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.478
Oh, simple. He overthought everything.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.274
His plan was way too complex.
He shoulda just walked right up to Lucifer

28:54.357 --> 28:56.359
and shot him like that stupid human did.

28:56.443 --> 28:59.946
That guy actually got closer
to destroying Lucifer than anyone else.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.366
What stupid human?

29:07.829 --> 29:10.749
-[dance music playing]
-[chattering]

29:28.099 --> 29:28.933
Carol?

29:30.852 --> 29:31.686
Whassup?

29:34.230 --> 29:37.942
Um, have you seen Lucifer anywhere?
He wanted me to meet him here.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.820
Maybe I have, maybe I haven't.
I mean, I haven't, though.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.906
-Oh.
-Um…

29:45.116 --> 29:46.826
Do you wanna maybe take those off?

29:46.910 --> 29:51.080
No, I do all my best work in the dark.
Not in a creepy way, but, you know, in a…

29:52.749 --> 29:54.334
bad boy kind of way.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.170
Cause I'm a bad boy. [slurps]

29:57.754 --> 29:58.713
Are you undercover?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.549
No. This is just how I roll,
after-hours style.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.009
You know what I'm saying?

30:03.510 --> 30:06.596
This is all me.

30:06.679 --> 30:10.141
I mean, not-- it's not really me,
but I mean, it is me.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.227
-I mean, it's me, me--
-Are you high?

30:12.310 --> 30:15.980
No, no, okay, you know what? Um, okay.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.357
This was a huge mistake.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.151
-You know what? That we can agree on.
-Okay.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.738
Okay, but just because we agree,
doesn't mean we're good for each other.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.948
Wait. Hold on. What?

30:25.031 --> 30:28.034
-I-- I gotta go!
-Do you think-- wait, Ella!

30:32.789 --> 30:34.791
Oh, leaving so soon?

30:34.874 --> 30:36.835
I just had the weirdest--

30:37.585 --> 30:39.504
Never mind. Where were you?

30:39.587 --> 30:42.799
Well, I saw you two lovebirds,
and I didn't wanna interrupt,

30:42.882 --> 30:45.677
'cause I know how much you love a bad boy.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.221
What? No, no.
I do not love bad boys, okay?

30:48.304 --> 30:51.683
Because bad boys are, well, bad.
I actually hate them.

30:51.766 --> 30:55.854
Oh, well, I wish you would've informed me
of this personal growth. Duly noted.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.190
Wait a second.
This was all your doing, wasn't it?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.441
Yes, it was.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.361
So apart from his name,
please don't be upset with Carol.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.698
Just tell me what you're looking for now
and I'll make the necessary adjustments.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.992
[sighs] I don't even know.

31:09.075 --> 31:12.036
I mean, I thought
I liked Carol the way he was,

31:12.120 --> 31:16.541
but I don't even know who that is.
I mean, he clearly knows how to lie.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.544
Like I said, that was my doing,
and technically, it's not a lie.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.880
But he was willing
to go along with it, Lucifer.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.339
Willing to manipulate me

31:23.423 --> 31:26.759
and the point is
I don't know if I can trust him.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.262
I mean,
if he can lie about being a bad boy,

31:29.345 --> 31:32.307
then maybe he is lying
about "liking" kung fu movies.

31:32.390 --> 31:36.644
And next thing you know, he's got
a secret room full of murder flowers.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.315
Oh, right. I see.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.817
You're suffering from Pete-TSD.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.485
[sighs] I just…

31:45.403 --> 31:50.742
I mean, it figures too, with everything
feeling so strange, like God's gone. I--

31:51.993 --> 31:55.413
I've been pretending
like he's still up there,

31:55.496 --> 31:59.834
but I'm gonna need the real deal
for this Carol situation, and…

32:01.753 --> 32:04.422
I've been trying really hard, but…

32:05.924 --> 32:07.508
I just can't feel him.

32:08.635 --> 32:12.388
Well, I'm sure that somebody
somewhere is trying to remedy that.

32:13.556 --> 32:17.769
Unfortunately for you, you're not
the person he needs to help right now.

32:20.521 --> 32:24.233
Unless, if me helping you prove

32:24.317 --> 32:28.279
that Carol isn't a lying, cheating
serial killer can actually help him.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.822
Conundrum averted.

32:31.824 --> 32:34.661
Miss Lopez, I'll do it.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.870
Do what?

32:38.414 --> 32:39.582
-[clicks]
-[Lucifer] Oh.

32:39.666 --> 32:40.625
[chuckles]

32:41.751 --> 32:44.837
I always forget what an excellent
pick-lock you are, Miss Lopez.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.173
[groans] Let's just do
what we came here to do

32:47.256 --> 32:50.176
before I change my mind
and Carol comes home from work.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.135
Hmm.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.096
[sighs]

32:54.597 --> 32:55.682
Ooh.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.352
Posh, if bland, furniture.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.940
Photograph of his mom. [chuckles]

33:04.023 --> 33:06.150
Oh, kung fu posters everywhere, see?

33:06.943 --> 33:10.029
He's clearly what he presents to be,
a poster boy for beige.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.991
And since that's what you're
going for these days, you win!

33:13.074 --> 33:14.575
And so do I. Come on.

33:14.659 --> 33:18.162
I can't leave until
I see what's in his closet. [inhales]

33:19.539 --> 33:22.375
[groans] Will the helping never end?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.922
Come on,
what are you waiting for? Open it.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.675
Right. Yeah. [clears throat]

33:30.758 --> 33:32.468
[pants]

33:33.302 --> 33:34.512
[blows]

33:34.595 --> 33:37.598
[gasping]

33:37.682 --> 33:40.268
Oh! Okay.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.604
[knocking]

33:43.688 --> 33:47.525
Okay. No secret room. [gasps]

33:47.608 --> 33:49.986
No murder flowers.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.155
[sighs] Ah!

33:52.238 --> 33:53.281
Nothing scary.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.657
Well, speak for yourself.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.911
Personally, I am terrified
at the amount of khakis he owns.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.413
Goodness me.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.956
Wait a second. [pants]

34:02.040 --> 34:03.875
There's still that missing year.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.710
What was he doing that whole time?

34:05.793 --> 34:09.422

34:17.889 --> 34:19.807
[exhales] You're right.

you could come over and dust for prints

-You did what?
-I stole your personnel file.

44:47.643 --> 44:51.021
I worried about your vice days
and that missing year, and I broke in.

44:53.607 --> 44:54.900
And I found your trunk.

44:55.484 --> 44:56.985
And I opened it,

44:57.069 --> 45:02.950
which I-- I know
is something that is yours to tell

45:03.033 --> 45:05.077
in-- in your own time and--

45:05.160 --> 45:06.245
It's okay.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.623
I'm not ashamed of it.

45:09.707 --> 45:13.210
It's just, it's something that
doesn't come up in casual conversation,

45:13.293 --> 45:16.547
and as for the year, uh, that is missing,

45:16.630 --> 45:18.590
I-- I was in rehab.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.927
And when you get out of rehab,

45:22.010 --> 45:25.889
they tell you to take things slowly.
Everything.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.183
Including dating.

45:28.267 --> 45:33.772
And I think that's maybe
why I've been so buttoned up.

struggling to figure out who I am again.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.781
It's just easy.

45:43.991 --> 45:48.287
I'm just the best version of myself again.

45:50.247 --> 45:51.123
[exhales]

45:52.458 --> 45:54.877
Well, I-- I get it.

45:54.960 --> 46:00.924
I mean, figuring out
who you really are is quite the journey.

46:01.008 --> 46:05.888
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-And I am so sorry for what I did, Carol.

46:05.971 --> 46:10.476
And-- okay, not that this is
any excuse whatsoever, but, um…

46:10.559 --> 46:15.355
[clicks tongue]
…the last guy I dated was sort of a, um,

46:15.939 --> 46:17.608
serial killer.

46:18.317 --> 46:21.153
And, uh, that sort of thing

46:21.236 --> 46:25.866
tends to lead to a little mistrust
in the romance department.

46:29.828 --> 46:30.662
Wow.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.293
I guess that's one more thing
we have in common, huh? [chuckles]

46:36.835 --> 46:37.711
Baggage.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.380
-Yeah. Buckets of baggage.
-[chuckles]

46:40.464 --> 46:42.216
Yeah. [chuckles]

46:43.801 --> 46:46.637
So you're not mad?

46:46.720 --> 46:49.598
Well, it's not great that
you broke into my apartment

46:49.681 --> 46:52.976
and stole my personnel file, but, um,

46:54.102 --> 46:56.188
I'm gonna go out on a limb and

46:57.105 --> 46:59.274
say it's a sign you like me too?

47:01.985 --> 47:04.446
You still wanna go see Supercop?

47:08.325 --> 47:09.201
Yeah.

47:10.661 --> 47:11.537
Cool. [chuckles]

47:11.620 --> 47:13.038
-Great.
-All right, great.

47:13.121 --> 47:16.959
Just-- just one more, just tiny thing. Um…

47:18.627 --> 47:22.464
Promise me that
if you ever wanna know anything,

47:22.548 --> 47:25.551
um, about me, ever again, that, uh,

47:27.177 --> 47:28.470
that you'll just ask.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.514
Deal.

47:31.598 --> 47:32.432
Great.

47:34.351 --> 47:37.604
-[chuckles] See ya.
-[laughs]

47:39.439 --> 47:42.317
[Ella and Lucifer chuckle]

47:44.361 --> 47:47.447
[inhales, exhales]

47:51.118 --> 47:53.036
[sighs] Damn.

47:54.329 --> 47:55.372
[groans]

48:03.255 --> 48:04.214
[exclaims] Hey!

48:06.174 --> 48:08.135
Oh, sorry.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.428
Were you using this?

48:09.511 --> 48:10.971
Ah, finally! [laughs]

48:11.054 --> 48:12.222
An opponent.

48:12.306 --> 48:15.309
Thinking I'd be Forrest Gumping forever.
Here you go. Ball up.

48:16.018 --> 48:17.144
[laughs]

48:19.646 --> 48:21.690
I'm not here for ping-pong.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.071
Oh, whoa, holy wow! Those are--

48:30.532 --> 48:32.993
Wait a minute. Did Lucifer send you?

48:33.577 --> 48:34.870
Not exactly.

48:34.953 --> 48:36.830
But he is the reason why I'm here.

48:36.914 --> 48:40.542
-Huh?
-Ugh! You're ruining all my cool lines.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.253
-[sighs]
-I heard you almost killed the Devil.

48:43.337 --> 48:44.463
Yeah.

48:45.422 --> 48:46.423
Almost.

48:47.090 --> 48:49.009
It was one
of the worst things I've ever done.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.886
In fact, I feel really guilty about it.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.974
Very guilty, in fact.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.477
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

48:59.061 --> 49:03.941
Speaking of, how did you get
so close to killing him, exactly?

49:06.944 --> 49:08.111
I was manipulated.

49:09.655 --> 49:10.656
By an angel.

49:10.739 --> 49:12.658
Ah. Michael, right?

49:12.741 --> 49:15.285
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, I know him. He's the worst.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.121
[sighs] Honestly,
you shouldn't beat yourself up about it.

49:18.205 --> 49:22.542
I mean, lots of humans,
even angels, have fallen for his lies.

49:23.669 --> 49:27.047
But I'd love to hear
your side of the story.

49:28.423 --> 49:30.050
[laughs]

49:31.009 --> 49:33.387
You're trying
to manipulate me too, aren't you?

49:34.429 --> 49:36.014
What, you think I'm stupid?

49:36.598 --> 49:38.976
-No shit, Sherlock.
-Well, you know what?

49:40.060 --> 49:43.522
I'm not gonna help you hurt Lucifer.
I don't care who you are.

49:44.690 --> 49:47.859
For all I know, that's what
got me into Hell in the first place.

49:48.944 --> 49:49.820
Suit yourself.

49:50.570 --> 49:52.990
But just so you know,

49:53.865 --> 49:56.868
Lucifer's not the only one
who likes to make deals.

49:57.452 --> 50:01.164
And, um, I think I know
something you might be interested in.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.583
[chuckles]
What could you possibly do for me?

50:03.667 --> 50:05.502
I can get you out of here.

50:06.628 --> 50:09.047
[laughs] Yeah, right. It's not possible.

50:09.131 --> 50:10.132
Except it is.

50:12.217 --> 50:16.013
[inhales] Look, Lucifer said
he's still trying to figure out a way, so…

50:16.096 --> 50:19.933
[chuckles] What's there to figure?
It's easy. I can just fly you up to Earth.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.895
Any angel can. And we all know it.

50:23.979 --> 50:27.065
So then why would Lucifer
leave me down here for thousands of years?

50:28.608 --> 50:31.111
No clue, but he did.

50:33.989 --> 50:36.575
Anyway, if you're not interested--

50:36.658 --> 50:37.492
Wait.

50:43.206 --> 50:46.501
Maybe I can help you. [exhales]

50:49.921 --> 50:52.007
Look who's not so stupid after all.

50:57.637 --> 50:58.597
[exhales]

51:02.309 --> 51:03.226
You're still awake?

51:03.310 --> 51:05.020
Mm. [inhales]

51:06.396 --> 51:08.982
Yes, and not in a good way.

51:10.650 --> 51:12.444
Maybe I can help with that.

51:12.527 --> 51:13.820
[chuckles]

51:16.865 --> 51:18.450
[sighs] So?

51:19.284 --> 51:21.203
How was your day, honey? [scoffs]

51:21.286 --> 51:23.121
Oh, uneventful.

51:23.205 --> 51:25.415
You? You feeling godly yet?

51:25.499 --> 51:27.292
Well, I helped Carol,

51:27.375 --> 51:31.505
but then I was genuinely happy
when he and Miss Lopez worked out.

51:32.255 --> 51:33.632
And that's a bad thing?

51:33.715 --> 51:36.802
Happy for both of them,
which means somewhere along the way

51:36.885 --> 51:40.972
I ended up caring about the stupid man,
so mission not accomplished.

51:41.056 --> 51:44.935
Well, maybe this just means that
you can learn to care about all humans.

51:45.018 --> 51:47.979
[laughs] Well, I admire your positivity,

51:48.063 --> 51:51.024
but if that's the solution,
then I'm never gonna be God.

51:52.901 --> 51:54.611
-Lucifer.
-[sighs]

51:54.694 --> 51:56.196
You will figure this out.

51:56.279 --> 51:57.531
I hope so.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.826
I'm sorry this is taking
longer than we thought.

52:00.909 --> 52:04.412
-There's no rush, right?
-[inhales] Well, doesn't seem to be.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.792
Maybe we should just take our time.

52:15.757 --> 52:19.261
Wow, you really, uh,
put away a lot of candy in there.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.596
Yep. [exhales]

52:21.680 --> 52:24.891
Known to do that. Call me Snacky Chan.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.770
Oh, man, you're so pop-corny.

52:28.854 --> 52:31.481
[both laugh]

52:31.565 --> 52:34.651
[sighs] Well, this is me.

52:34.734 --> 52:36.528
Wow! Nice.

52:36.611 --> 52:38.488
Yeah. [chuckles]

52:39.698 --> 52:40.991
Hey, Ella, um…

52:43.827 --> 52:46.163
I have to say that I think tonight

52:46.872 --> 52:48.790
is the best date I've ever had.

52:51.209 --> 52:52.043
Well,

52:52.794 --> 52:56.631
I would call you a liar, but… [chuckles]

53:01.469 --> 53:02.345
Good night.

53:07.225 --> 53:08.143
[chuckles]

53:10.145 --> 53:12.981
Hey, if you're still up there,

53:14.399 --> 53:15.233
thanks.

53:16.902 --> 53:20.030
[chuckles softly]

53:20.113 --> 53:21.072
[thuds]

53:21.156 --> 53:22.157
[croaking]

53:28.830 --> 53:32.125
[croaking continues]

53:43.511 --> 53:44.596
What the…
