-After all this time, all that's happened?
-I didn't realize you're owed more.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.916
I'm owed nothing. The lotuses are here.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
[Luna] The lotuses.

The lotuses in exchange for our full
withdrawal from the enclaves.

A Shopkeeper covenant guarantees it.

06:49.666 --> 06:53.375
You hesitated for a heartbeat
to kill a thief.

06:53.458 --> 06:59.541
That heartbeat has killed so many more.
This horror belongs to you.

06:59.625 --> 07:04.083
I've failed my friends,
my family, my goddess.

07:04.166 --> 07:08.041

-The goddess, she could help you.
-Because I'm broken?

09:33.083 --> 09:37.166
-That's not how I meant it.
-We've both seen this place.

17:03.833 --> 17:04.958
[breathes heavily]

17:09.166 --> 17:10.791
Mene is dead.

Let me help you.

17:51.416 --> 17:52.916
Fuck.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.125
[Sylvion] Moon children.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.291
[growls]

18:05.958 --> 18:10.458
Your violence is like kindness
in the shadow of my rage.

[growls]

18:22.791 --> 18:24.333
Flee!

18:25.416 --> 18:28.958
Selemene. The usurper.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.125
You may take the spark,

18:31.208 --> 18:34.875
but you will only ever be a simple thief.

18:34.958 --> 18:38.458
[rumbling]

18:39.166 --> 18:45.250
Your worshipers abandon you,
as your primary abandoned you.

18:45.333 --> 18:48.541
Your child. Filomena.

18:48.625 --> 18:52.125
She died hating you. You know this.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.625
It rots your heart.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.083
Do not speak her name.

18:57.166 --> 19:01.125
Tell me, how many Filomenas
have there been?

19:01.208 --> 19:05.083
How many broken things
have you taken into your embrace

19:05.166 --> 19:09.791
then cast aside,
knowing you failed to care for her?

19:09.875 --> 19:12.666
Knowing you chose?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.375
He did this.

19:14.458 --> 19:18.875
He sent you. He sent you to torment me.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.250
I struck a bargain.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.041

20:02.583 --> 20:04.958
[Terrorblade] Oh, poor girl.

20:05.041 --> 20:08.625
Made herself a god
so she might never be alone.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.333
[grunts]

20:14.416 --> 20:18.583
Now her shrines are dark,
her armies scattered,

20:18.666 --> 20:21.166
her faithful, silent.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.250

20:33.333 --> 20:34.625
[groans]

20:34.708 --> 20:39.791
Do you know what a demon calls a god
who does not know worship?

20:39.875 --> 20:43.375
A god who does not know love?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.083
[screaming]

20:47.791 --> 20:48.833
Food.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.708
[people grunting]

20:53.708 --> 20:55.583
Fall back on me. Now!

The mouse who thunders,
come to rejoin our battle.

21:49.583 --> 21:52.833
Release my bonds. I will be quick.

21:53.416 --> 21:57.125
Done fighting you. I'm here for the boy.

Don't worry, buddy.

22:07.833 --> 22:11.416
-We're gonna help you.
-Get him up. Get him home.

22:12.916 --> 22:16.000
[somber music]

22:18.666 --> 22:20.916
Let the Dragon Knights take him.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.708
There will be time enough for war.

22:42.875 --> 22:46.083
[Luna breathing heavily]

22:46.666 --> 22:49.916
We're cut off.
No word from the Nightsilver Woods.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.458
Not even the priests can feel Selemene.

22:53.500 --> 22:57.250
There may be help, there may not be.

22:57.333 --> 22:59.583
We have to assume there is none.

22:59.666 --> 23:03.875
Rest. The Order needs its captain.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.500
[heavy breathing]

23:05.583 --> 23:07.958
I can't lead them.

23:08.916 --> 23:09.750
You have to.

23:10.375 --> 23:11.375
Not like this.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.958
Mirana, they need you to get them home.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.083
They need their Princess.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.750
[groans]

23:23.750 --> 23:27.458
[Terrorblade]
I could do this for eternity.

23:27.541 --> 23:30.166
Perhaps in the next universe.
