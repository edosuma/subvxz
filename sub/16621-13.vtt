00:04.137 --> 00:06.238
WHITING:
<i>We both know you killed Boyle. </i>
DEEKS:<i> I didn't.</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:07.272
Then who did?

00:07.307 --> 00:08.607
Isn't it your department's job

00:08.642 --> 00:10.142
to find the killer?
We did.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.743
And he's sitting
right across from me.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.246
The whole Internal Affairs
investigation--

00:14.281 --> 00:15.647
John Quinn didn't kill Boyle.
I did,

00:15.682 --> 00:17.249
and I did it to protect Tiffany.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.284
HETTY:
<i> That's</i>

00:19.319 --> 00:21.086
my resignation.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.488
It's signed and dated
90 days from now.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.491
If we haven't found
the mole by then,

00:26.526 --> 00:29.161
you won't even have to ask me
to leave.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.562
NELL:
<i> Is this</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:32.164
Natalie Grant?
I met Natalie

00:32.199 --> 00:33.432
at the Promenade.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.699
Some dive bar.

00:34.734 --> 00:35.734
(gunfire)
Natalie!

00:35.769 --> 00:36.802
SAM:
Wait!

00:36.837 --> 00:37.302
Natalie!

00:38.238 --> 00:38.803
(grunting)

00:38.839 --> 00:40.439
CALLEN:
<i> Natalie,</i>

00:40.474 --> 00:41.706
who do you work for?

00:41.741 --> 00:42.741
Where did you
meet them?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.309
Rae.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.777
<i> Lemon Grove Park.</i>

00:45.812 --> 00:47.112
CALLEN:
<i> She said her name was Heather.</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:51.116
<i> Tried to pick Granger up</i>
<i> a couple months back at a bar.</i>

00:51.151 --> 00:52.751
Do you really want to wait
till morning?

00:52.786 --> 00:54.620
What do you think?

00:58.458 --> 01:00.192

Hands up!

02:34.454 --> 02:36.355
Stand back. Move away.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.959
I've got a pulse.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.195
We need an R.A. unit
at this location.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.430
Female victim,
blunt trauma to the head,

02:45.465 --> 02:47.232

Looks like you've shaken off
the rust, Tin Man.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.301
Did you expect anything less?

03:23.336 --> 03:25.704
No expectations.
Right.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.673
I know Hetty sent you here
to check up on me.
Can't a guy

03:28.708 --> 03:30.642
come down here to work
on his shot without an agenda?

03:30.677 --> 03:31.543
Well?

03:31.578 --> 03:32.744
Well what?

03:32.779 --> 03:34.313
What are you gonna tell her?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.483
That you have become
a conspiracy theorist.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.552
Have I?
Kens,

03:40.587 --> 03:42.454
you know I want you back
in the field more than anyone.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.655
Not more than me.

03:43.690 --> 03:44.656
And you seem ready,

03:44.691 --> 03:46.658
but...
But what?

03:46.693 --> 03:48.860
It's not my decision.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.695
But you can still tell her
that you think I'm ready.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.964
And she will still wait
until she thinks you're ready.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.667
And I am. I have been working
harder than ever.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.602
I have been coming here
every single day.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.872
I am ready.
I feel like myself again. I do.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.378
Can't hurt
to put in a good word.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.715
I'll tell you what will hurt.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.850
Hmm.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.419
When I smoke you again.

04:14.454 --> 04:15.487
(chuckles)

04:15.522 --> 04:18.290
Might need another squirt
from the oil can first.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.491
Ooh.

04:20.627 --> 04:21.993
Look at us, huh, so in sync,

04:22.028 --> 04:23.995
walking into work
the exact same moment.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.665
I got a question for you--
give me your top five

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
tourist attractions
in L.A.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.501
Go.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.735
I don't do tourist
attractions.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.470
All right,
let me rephrase that.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.939
Give me the top five places
you would take out-of-towners.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.676
Give-give me, give me
Sam Hanna's L.A.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.311
I don't do listicles.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.880
Why? They're so fun
and digestible.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.949
Yeah, so are gummy vitamins.
Doesn't make 'em okay.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.551
Mm, not even
the bear-shaped multivites?

04:46.586 --> 04:47.619
'Cause those are awesome.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.954
I mean, how else
do you get your daily

04:49.989 --> 04:52.624
recommended dosage?
Direct from

04:52.659 --> 04:54.359
the source.
So y-you're

04:54.394 --> 04:56.494
telling me that you eat
the exact amount necessary

04:56.529 --> 04:58.797
of fruits and vegetables
every single day?

04:58.832 --> 05:01.666
This house wasn't built
on gummy bears.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.468
(groans, chuckles)

05:03.503 --> 05:05.837
(laughing):
Ow.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.373
Yeah. I'm gonna go have
to have that inspected.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.075
Uh, why are you doing
all this tourism anyway?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.344
You, uh, moonlighting
as a travel writer now?

05:12.379 --> 05:14.412
No, no. No, I was
just taking your advice,

05:14.447 --> 05:16.081
you know, that Kensi and I
don't have to do the same thing

05:16.116 --> 05:17.882
every single day,
so I was just trying to find

05:17.917 --> 05:20.552
some new and exciting things
to do.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.987
Oh, so you're trying to find
a place to propose.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.924
(chuckling):
Oh, no. No.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.592
Yes.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.893
Do it at the beach.

05:28.928 --> 05:29.994
Ocean breezes.

05:30.029 --> 05:30.995
Sunset.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.064
Maximum romance.
See,

05:33.099 --> 05:33.965
this is exactly what
I was thinking.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.667
But this is
also what she's expecting,

05:35.702 --> 05:37.068
which is why I can't do that.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.571
Oh. So you're looking
for the unexpected.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.740
See, that's what I'm talking
about. You and I,<i> simpatico.</i>

05:41.775 --> 05:42.807
We are so not<i> simpatico.</i>

05:42.842 --> 05:44.109
We are<i> simpatico.</i>

05:44.144 --> 05:45.810
We are not simpatico at all.
ERIC: Guys,

05:45.845 --> 05:47.912
needed up in Ops A.S.A.P.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.447
That's it?

05:49.482 --> 05:50.582
No quips?

05:50.617 --> 05:51.549
No soliloquies?

05:51.584 --> 05:52.384
No nerd trivia?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.551
SAM:
No show tunes?

05:53.586 --> 05:55.019
No flugelhorn?

05:55.054 --> 05:56.988
Not today.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.732
What do we got?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.934
Last night
Granger went back to the bar

06:09.969 --> 06:11.936
where he first met Heather.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.671
Natalie's handler.
Granger's been

06:13.706 --> 06:15.006
trying to get her since
Natalie I.D.'d her weeks ago.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.007
SAM:
He's gone back

06:16.042 --> 06:17.175
a few times without us.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.643
Apparently,
this time,

06:18.678 --> 06:20.011
he made contact.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.913
Granger was with Heather
last night?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.548
And this morning.
Wow,

06:23.583 --> 06:26.084
G-dog, mixing a little business
with pleasure, huh?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.552
Not exactly.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.020
NELL:
Early this morning, LAPD

06:29.055 --> 06:31.423
received a phone call
from an unknown source regarding

06:31.458 --> 06:33.558
possible gunshots
at Heather's house.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.960
When LAPD arrived,
they found Heather bound,

06:35.995 --> 06:37.929
badly beaten, with a broken rib.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.464
Where was Granger?
He was still there

06:39.499 --> 06:40.799
when the cops arrived.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.434
He was arrested on site.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.436
There's no way that
Granger did this.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.571
Not even if it meant getting us
closer to the mole.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.706
You know that,
I know that, but...

06:48.741 --> 06:51.042
Has anyone spoken to him?
ERIC: Negative. LAPD

06:51.077 --> 06:52.710
isn't giving us any information.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.679
NELL: Honestly, we expected
more cooperation out of them,

06:54.714 --> 06:57.048
given our relationship
to the suspect.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.950
I'll go down there, see if
I can pull some strings.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.518
Where is Heather
right now?

07:00.553 --> 07:02.954
At the hospital.
Still unconscious.

07:02.989 --> 07:03.554
Sam and I will head
to the crime scene,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.056
see how far we can get.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.724
And how much we can find out
about Heather,

07:06.759 --> 07:08.660
who she works for.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.862
Cool. Uh,
what should I do?

07:10.897 --> 07:13.765
We'll call you as soon
as we find something.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.967
Yeah. Um, where's Hetty?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.669
God, if I had a dollar
for every time

07:17.704 --> 07:19.237
I've been asked
that question,

07:19.272 --> 07:22.073
I'd have $2,389.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.843
Oh, uh, downstairs.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.944
Thank you.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.112
(chuckles)

07:28.147 --> 07:31.583
(groans)
Impeccable timing.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.219
What's going on?

07:34.254 --> 07:37.689
Ms. Blye, you remember
Under Secretary Duggan.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.625
How could I forget? To what
do we owe this pleasure?

07:40.660 --> 07:42.894
The under secretary is here
to oversee...

07:42.929 --> 07:46.231
my departure from NCIS.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.966
Well, that's ridiculous.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.168
You made the deal
with the secretary of defense.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.536
You had 90 days
to find the mole,

07:51.571 --> 07:53.238
and your 90 days have expired.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.706
So you're just here
to see heads roll,

07:54.741 --> 07:56.140
even if they're the wrong heads?

07:56.175 --> 07:57.976
Ms. Blye.
Hmm?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.712
I am a woman of my word.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.082
Assistant Director Granger
will be in charge

08:04.117 --> 08:05.250
until I find
a suitable,

08:05.285 --> 08:07.252
permanent
replacement.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.786
I need to brief him immediately.

08:08.821 --> 08:09.954
Where is he?

08:09.989 --> 08:12.157
Oh. Um...

08:18.097 --> 08:20.598
I haven't seen him.

08:20.633 --> 08:21.633
Hmm.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.558
We know Granger wanted
to plant surveillance,

08:46.593 --> 08:48.760
if he ever got
this far.
The question is:

08:48.795 --> 08:50.628
how far did he actually get
before Heather was able

08:50.663 --> 08:52.230
to execute her
own game plan?

08:52.265 --> 08:55.700
I don't like the feeling
of any of this, G.
Yeah,

08:55.735 --> 08:58.703
makes two of us.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.104
There's Evans.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.941
Good place to start.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.842
Detective Evans.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.011
Before you even ask,
the answer's no.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.980
We understand your position.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.950
We don't want to make this
any more difficult for you.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.952
I can't let you inside.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.587
But...

09:15.622 --> 09:17.589
maybe I didn't see you loitering
around the yard

09:17.624 --> 09:18.623
for a few minutes.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.794
Any signs of the victim
waking up?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.128
Not yet.

09:24.163 --> 09:25.931
Clock's ticking.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.201
(engine starts)

09:32.872 --> 09:34.806
(beeping)
Have a seat.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.980
(handcuffs clack)

09:47.086 --> 09:48.920
Have a nice day.
Hi!

09:48.955 --> 09:50.755
Remember me?
From, like, three minutes ago?

09:50.790 --> 09:52.957
The, uh, officer that you
said was gonna be at his desk

09:52.992 --> 09:56.361
was not actually
at his... desk.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.630
My mistake.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.265
I know you heard me
when I said this,

10:01.300 --> 10:02.800
but I don't think
you were really listening.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.802
I'm-I'm a cop.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.305
As in I
am a cop.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.173
As in I am one of you guys.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.409
Would you like
a homecoming parade?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.145
Nope. No, no. I don't... I don't
need a homecoming parade.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.014
I just need to get
to Owen Granger,

10:16.049 --> 10:18.216
please.
Were you listening when I said

10:18.251 --> 10:20.084
that Assistant Director Granger
was being processed

10:20.119 --> 10:21.252
and I don't

10:21.287 --> 10:22.887
currently know where he is?

10:22.922 --> 10:24.088
But you know how to find him.

10:24.123 --> 10:24.855
And you know
how I know that? Again,

10:24.891 --> 10:26.391
I'm a cop, and I
know how to use

10:26.426 --> 10:28.126
one of these little
keyboards in the system.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.794
Have a seat, Detective Deeks.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.932
(sighs)

10:36.102 --> 10:38.102
Oh, uh, congratulations.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.338
The, uh, beautiful ring

10:40.373 --> 10:41.839
you have on your hand.
You're obviously,

10:41.874 --> 10:43.341
you're obviously married.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.043
For eight years.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.678
Well, it's never too late
to celebrate, right?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.680
Just out of curiosity,

10:48.715 --> 10:50.381
where, uh, where were you asked?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.350
I bet it was someplace amazing,
right?

10:52.385 --> 10:54.719
He do a hot air balloon?

10:54.754 --> 10:56.354
Or, oh, like a vineyard?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.423
Maybe on top of, like, a snowy
mountain peak in Mammoth?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.757
That'd be beautiful.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.025
I asked.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.361
Oh. I guess it is 2017, right?

11:03.396 --> 11:06.898
Although that would
make it 2009 or 2010,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.332
which is very progressive.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.701
He's a lucky man.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.235
He's a she.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.838
(laughs)
0 for 2 then.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.707
Um, while you continue

11:15.742 --> 11:17.709
to-to look for Granger,

11:17.744 --> 11:19.210
for real, where-where,

11:19.245 --> 11:20.478
where did you propose?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.313
WHITING:
Make it 0 for 3.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.148
Which means...

11:24.183 --> 11:25.984
you're out.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.287
Well, not to be pedantic,

11:29.322 --> 11:31.089
but it's actually three strikes,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.957
then you're out,
so in this case,

11:32.992 --> 11:35.426
I would just have a really
terrible batting average.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.730
Either way,

11:38.765 --> 11:40.331
Granger's the least of your
worries, Detective Deeks.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.167
Agree to disagree,
Detective Whiting.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.837
We've got new evidence
in your cold case.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.306
It might just be the
smoking gun I need.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.475
Oh, no pun intended.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.344
You really got nothing better
to do in Internal Affairs?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.346
We're gonna, we're gonna do
this dance again?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.414
We really are.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.049
Wow.
(chuckles)

11:58.084 --> 11:59.450
And I'm so glad
you're here.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.452
Saves me a trip
in L.A. traffic.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.121
Cuff him.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.324
Cuffs? You don't think
that's overkill?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.892
Unless that's
some sort of fetish.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.527
You know they got apps
for that now, right?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.028
Oh, look. It's, uh,

12:11.063 --> 12:13.297
Detective Deeks
with handcuffs on.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.432
Swipe right.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.337
Cuff him.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.073
Whatever you need.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.307
DUGGAN:
I want this person fired.

12:23.342 --> 12:24.175
This person...

12:26.212 --> 12:28.046
(continues speaking
indistinctly)

12:34.187 --> 12:35.920
(gasps)
Wow.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.321
(chuckles) I forget how good
you are at that.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.390
So Deeks has
been texting me.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.525
He goes, "Whiting.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.293
New evidence. Arrested."

12:42.328 --> 12:44.262
I think she has
him at the precinct.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.830
Also, two members
of our team arrested

12:45.865 --> 12:47.799
on the same day
for different crimes?

12:47.834 --> 12:49.233
That is not a coincidence.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.435
I know. It feels like an
offensive, doesn't it?

12:51.470 --> 12:52.537
Yeah.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.939
What else did Mr. Deeks say?

12:54.974 --> 12:56.307
I mean, it's all cryptic.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.475
I don't think he even
got to see Granger yet,

12:57.510 --> 12:58.976
but he's also
stopped responding,

12:59.011 --> 13:00.478
so I think he's in custody, too.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.981
All this time hunting
for the mole,

13:04.016 --> 13:06.083
and now it seems
as if the mole

13:06.118 --> 13:07.885
is headed straight at us.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.254
I'll tell Callen and Sam.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.456
What do you want to do
about Duggan?

13:12.491 --> 13:16.161
Oh, let's leave him in the dark
as long as possible.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.297
Okay.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.540
It's trash day.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.310
Heather's bins
aren't out.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.911
Most people put them out
the night before.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.280
Unless you're like me and
you don't generate any trash.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.448
Excuse me?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.617
I have almost
no carbon footprint.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.953
Coming this fall:

13:41.988 --> 13:44.055
<i> An Inconvenient Lie.</i>

13:44.090 --> 13:45.623
Well, joke all you want.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.559
I'm just doing my part.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.394
Yeah. I've seen
inside your fridge.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.296
Those beer bottles
empty themselves?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.497
Those are recyclable.
They don't count.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.032
(chuckles)

13:55.067 --> 13:57.268
Zero.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.003
Zero, huh?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.149
Completely empty.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.085
So either Heather's watching

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
her own carbon footprint, or
she's smart enough to hide it.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.255
Or this isn't her real house.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.023
(phone rings)

14:19.058 --> 14:20.324
I got Kens.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.492
Yeah?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.046
(camera shutter clicks)

14:45.351 --> 14:47.451
Roofies.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.221
AKA a good way
to drug you into forgetting.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.589
Yeah, well,
we got bigger problems.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.391
Deeks just got arrested at LAPD.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.959
For what?

14:54.994 --> 14:56.928
Something about new evidence on
his cold case.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.329
IA picked him up
when he was looking

14:58.364 --> 14:59.463
for Granger.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.065
(indistinct chatter nearby)

15:01.100 --> 15:02.533
SAM:
DEA?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.268
CALLEN:
What the hell
are they doing here?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.237
I'll see what's going on.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.173
Agent Hanna.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.442
Sanchez.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.144
I hate to ask, but, uh,

15:13.179 --> 15:15.112
you mind opening
your trunk for us?

15:15.147 --> 15:18.983
You do know this is
a government vehicle, right?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.618
Yeah, I know, but we'd
appreciate the courtesy.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.958
Sure.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.197
(gasps)

15:37.303 --> 15:38.636
SANCHEZ: I'm afraid you're
gonna have to come with us,

15:38.671 --> 15:39.704
so we can straighten this out.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.106
Hold-hold on!
Look, Sam.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.474
Something is wrong!
Sam...

15:43.509 --> 15:45.409
You think I would come
to a crime scene

15:45.444 --> 15:47.278
with a corpse and cocaine
in my car?

15:47.313 --> 15:49.080
Huh?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.348
Your weapon, please.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.349
Are you kidding me?

15:51.384 --> 15:53.051
Look, Sam, your weapon.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.993
Cuff him.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.086
Can you at least tell me
if Granger is still here?

16:29.121 --> 16:30.321
I cannot.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.789
Can you tell me
where Detective Deeks is?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.324
I cannot.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.292
Can you find somebody who can?

16:35.694 --> 16:38.129
You know Deeks is a lawyer,
right?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.463
He told me.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.298
Repeatedly.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.633
Of course he did.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.035
All right,
I'm gonna level with you.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.103
Deeks is my partner.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.571
He's my fiancé, actually.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.373
Well, not officially.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.275
He proposed
while I was in a coma.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.477
I was in a helicopter crash,
and that's why I was in a coma.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.179
I couldn't walk
or anything like that.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.514
And I'm actually lucky
to be alive.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.682
The point is

16:58.717 --> 17:00.718
I'm just waiting
for a real proposal,

17:00.753 --> 17:03.387
so I can actually say yes.

17:03.422 --> 17:06.490
That explains a lot.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.493
Please, could I just have
five minutes with Deeks?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.429
No.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.664
(sighs)
Seriously?

17:13.699 --> 17:16.100
Coma didn't pull
at a tiny heartstring?

17:16.135 --> 17:18.102
Wow.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.804
(sighs)

17:19.839 --> 17:21.539
Detective Whiting?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.074
Detective Whiting.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.309
Hey, give me a minute.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.644
Detective Whiting, hey!

17:26.679 --> 17:28.145
Nobody is giving me
a shred of information.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.480
Give me a damn minute.

17:29.515 --> 17:30.714
I'm not at liberty to discuss

17:30.749 --> 17:32.283
Deeks' case with you,
Agent Blye.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.285
Really? 'Cause last I checked,
it was ice cold.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.786
It warmed up.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.788
Okay, so what is it?

17:37.823 --> 17:39.590
What could you possibly have?

17:39.625 --> 17:41.325
I'm not discussing this
with you.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.494
Because you have nothing.

17:46.198 --> 17:49.166
The case is reopened,
Agent Blye.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.168
And my guess is

17:51.203 --> 17:52.570
is that you have an awful lot at
stake in clearing Deeks' name

17:52.605 --> 17:54.305
once and for all.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.740
Somebody is trying to create a
problem where there isn't one.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.709
Who is the source of this
new evidence you have?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.880
You know what?
It occurs to me now

18:02.915 --> 18:04.682
you probably know what
happened all those years ago.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.453
Maybe more than you did
last year.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.589
Perhaps now
is a good time

18:11.624 --> 18:13.324
to subpoena you and find out.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.395
Thank you for nothing.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.567
MRS. RAMIREZ:
<i>Your timing couldn't be better.</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:25.302
I just baked
these cookies today.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.404
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Ramirez.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.406
So have you had any other
visitors today?

18:29.441 --> 18:32.443
Anyone asking questions
about the neighborhood?

18:32.478 --> 18:35.146
Hmm. No. Not since last
week when little Marco

18:35.181 --> 18:37.681
from two doors down
stopped by to apologize

18:37.716 --> 18:39.583
for not picking up
after his dog.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.485
(chuckles)
L.A. problems, huh?

18:41.520 --> 18:43.621
Oh, frankly,
I don't mind.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.323
In this drought, my lawn can
use the extra fertilizer.

18:46.358 --> 18:47.825
(phone rings)

18:47.860 --> 18:49.360
Uh, excuse me.
I just have to get this.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.828
Oh. I'll get you some more milk.

18:52.831 --> 18:54.665
Kens.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.533
No luck getting
to Granger and Deeks.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.634
No one is talking.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.735
CALLEN:
Where are you?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.703
Leaving LAPD right now.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.572
Stay on your toes.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.374
Sam just got picked up
by the DEA at Heather's.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.342
Hold on, what?!

19:05.377 --> 19:06.877
What did they charge him with?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.280
Somebody planted drugs
and a dead body in his trunk.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.781
Callen, this is crazy.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.651
They're coming after all of us,
and we need to stop them.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.687
(sighs)
Where are you now?

19:16.722 --> 19:17.922
I'm not gonna say.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.424
Look, Sam found
evidence of pills

19:20.459 --> 19:22.459
that Heather may have used
to drug Granger.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.661
Now we know what Granger
was doing while

19:23.696 --> 19:25.396
Heather was getting beaten.
(sirens wailing)

19:25.431 --> 19:27.165
(men clamoring
across the street)

19:29.335 --> 19:30.768
Look, I got to keep moving.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.635
Looks like they're
coming after me.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.970
Who? DEA?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.940
ATF.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.609
We're all bring targeted
by different agencies.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.944
Whoever's doing this
has a lot of pull.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.745
Yeah, and a lot of connections.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.715
Someone like Duggan.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.717
He definitely has
the connections.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.452
AGENT:
Morgan.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.789
Yeah. What?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.224
Damn it. They must be
tracking me through my phone.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.592
He's across the street!

19:54.627 --> 19:55.626
Kensi, stay off the phone.
Hang up now.

19:55.661 --> 19:56.860
MORGAN:
Let's go! Let's go!

19:56.895 --> 19:58.796
(agents clamoring)

20:05.304 --> 20:07.504
How are your cookies, dear?

20:07.539 --> 20:08.673
Dear?

20:10.476 --> 20:12.509
(panting)

20:12.544 --> 20:15.412
(dog barking, panting)

20:15.447 --> 20:17.882
(dog growling)

20:23.722 --> 20:25.823
All right, nowhere to run,
Agent Callen! Nowhere to run!

20:25.858 --> 20:27.658
Easy, easy, easy.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.393
Good boy.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.594
All right,
let's cuff him, guys.

20:30.629 --> 20:31.629
Let's go.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.431
(barking)

20:34.466 --> 20:36.267
All right, hands behind your
back; you know the drill.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.635
Hands behind your back.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.636
AGENT:
Get him in line for escort...

20:38.671 --> 20:40.605
(dog barking)

20:42.041 --> 20:43.841
Ms. Lange.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.610
Why haven't we heard from
Assistant Director Granger yet?

20:46.645 --> 20:49.647
Well, I'm not his keeper.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.015
You don't find it unusual

20:51.050 --> 20:52.716
that no one seems to know
where he is?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.820
Oh, in this business,
nothing is unusual.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.736
Wow.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.806
You have had quite the career,
Henrietta.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.410
You know,

21:19.445 --> 21:21.945
despite all of this,

21:21.980 --> 21:24.715
I've always admired you
a great deal.

21:32.091 --> 21:36.393
I regret that this is how
it must come to an end.

21:36.428 --> 21:41.666
Uh, no one is sorrier than I,
Under Secretary.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.938
As your last order of business,

21:47.973 --> 21:49.907
find Granger.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.516
(chuckles)

22:02.755 --> 22:04.388
You guys heard from Callen?

22:04.423 --> 22:06.757
ATF picked him up
right after you talked to him.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.359
Okay, so, Callen was right.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.793
The mole is all over our system.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.994
We have to
operate offline

22:11.029 --> 22:12.996
if we're gonna stay
one step ahead.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.732
Is anyone else feeling
really off-balance here?

22:14.767 --> 22:16.433
I think that's the point.

22:16.468 --> 22:17.968
It's like the worst round
of multiball ever.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.503
Yeah, my flippers
are on overdrive.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.604
I'm sorry, what?

22:20.639 --> 22:21.939
Pinball.
Pinball.

22:21.974 --> 22:22.806
People still play that?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.075
Duh. Where have you been--
in a coma?

22:25.110 --> 22:26.677
Ooh!
Too soon, Eric.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.712
Okay, so, which ball

22:28.747 --> 22:31.014
are we gonna have to focus on
to get us out of this mess?

22:31.049 --> 22:32.850
First, they took Granger.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.017
Who went after Heather.

22:34.052 --> 22:35.285
Who's still unconscious.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.688
Which means we don't know what
really happened at Heather's.

22:37.723 --> 22:38.789
So I have to
make it back

22:38.824 --> 22:40.991
to the house and see
if I can find something there.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.793
Mm. LAPD has that place
on lockdown.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.461
There's no way
you'll get in unnoticed.

22:44.496 --> 22:45.796
Plus, it's probably
just a safe house.

22:45.831 --> 22:46.930
And we have no surveillance?

22:46.965 --> 22:48.632
Not from last night
or this morning?

22:48.667 --> 22:51.869
We poured over every angle.
Still nothing.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.604
(phone beeping)
Guys.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.872
Heather's awake.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.610
She just I.D.'d Granger
as her attacker.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.545
No...

23:01.580 --> 23:03.747
God.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.716
(indistinct chatter)

23:14.660 --> 23:16.861
Let's go.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.838
(lock buzzes)

23:30.108 --> 23:31.108
(grunts)

23:59.204 --> 24:01.038
You ready to talk?

24:01.073 --> 24:03.907
Not to you.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.642
That hurts.

24:05.677 --> 24:06.810
I thought we had something.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.212
Yeah, well, it's not you.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.813
It's me.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.815
(laughs)

24:11.850 --> 24:14.918
Just so you know,
I don't want to be friends.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.221
I want to speak
with another agent.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.090
I'm not taking
requests, Agent Hanna.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.125
Sanchez, let me explain
something to you.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.562
I know we've crossed paths, but
you don't know me very well.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.531
Now, I can give you
a crash course,

24:27.566 --> 24:29.733
that I guarantee
you won't enjoy,

24:29.768 --> 24:32.169
or you can give me
what I want right now.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.074
Trust me, it'll go a lot faster
if you indulge me.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.145
Give me a name.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.648
Talia Del Campo.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.217
You're out of luck.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.052
Talia's away on assignment.

24:49.087 --> 24:50.854
How far away?
Too far.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.890
So you're stuck with me.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.925
And stuck in here
till we can sort this out.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.736
Well, this is fun, huh?

25:05.771 --> 25:07.204
Me and you back
together again?

25:07.239 --> 25:08.939
I mean, is it just me,

25:08.974 --> 25:11.909
or do you have an overwhelming
sense of déjà vu?

25:11.944 --> 25:14.211
And I'm happy to do it over
and over again

25:14.246 --> 25:15.946
until we get to the truth,

25:15.981 --> 25:17.314
Detective Deeks.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.116
Yeah, how about we not do that,

25:19.151 --> 25:21.585
and you go and get my captain,
like I asked you to?

25:21.620 --> 25:23.253
Your captain's not available.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.621
I don't believe you.

25:24.656 --> 25:25.789
You don't have to believe me.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.658
Just know that right now,

25:27.693 --> 25:30.294
I'm the closest thing to an ally
you've got around here.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.829
You're the cl--
(laughing)

25:32.864 --> 25:34.865
Oh, my God,
that's a scary thought.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.900
That's even scarier
than thinking

25:36.935 --> 25:39.770
that I have to drink this
coffee for one more day.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.705
Speaking of which, we talked
about this, didn't we?

25:41.740 --> 25:43.740
I mean, you've had
a whole year to upgrade.

25:43.775 --> 25:46.076
I'm not looking for, like,
a barista with a bow tie

25:46.111 --> 25:48.645
offering me lattes, but maybe
you could get coffee better

25:48.680 --> 25:49.913
than what it is they serve

25:49.948 --> 25:51.782
in the vending machine
of my carwash.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.723
Can't do it.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.291
Are you done?

26:01.326 --> 26:02.292
Oh, that depends.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.227
You gonna go get my captain?

26:04.262 --> 26:06.830
Deeks, I already told you,
he's not available.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.999
Yeah, I remember
when you said that earlier.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.934
You know,

26:10.969 --> 26:13.136
as a cop,

26:13.171 --> 26:16.206
you know what I use more
than any of my training?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.076
Intuition.

26:19.111 --> 26:22.145
And you, you know,
being the diligent,

26:22.180 --> 26:24.014
finely-dressed-
in-that-pant-suit cop

26:24.049 --> 26:26.016
that you are probably
use the same thing,

26:26.051 --> 26:28.218
so what's yours telling you
right now?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.622
That I'm closer than ever
to getting the right guy.

26:31.657 --> 26:34.925
And that's because
you have what exactly?

26:34.960 --> 26:38.362
Name Tiffany Williams
ring a bell?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.263
You know what?

26:40.298 --> 26:44.334
You probably know her better
as Julie Sanders.

26:44.369 --> 26:47.170
You know,
former hooker

26:47.205 --> 26:49.906
and informant that you've been
paying to keep quiet.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.108
I was just helping her out.

26:51.143 --> 26:52.309
Why?

26:52.344 --> 26:54.077
Because she needed help.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.345
I don't believe you.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.346
I was a Boy Scout.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.314
I got a patch to prove it.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.784
(clicks tongue)

27:00.819 --> 27:03.153
Ooh!

27:03.188 --> 27:05.722
You know what's hilarious
about this is that, uh,

27:05.757 --> 27:08.959
this information just drops
out of the sky on the same

27:08.994 --> 27:11.094
exact day that
Granger gets framed

27:11.129 --> 27:13.363
and then arrested.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.934
Like, you-you do realize
you're being used, right?

27:19.037 --> 27:21.004
I ran into your partner earlier.

27:21.039 --> 27:23.674
Oh, Kensi is here.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.375
Well, well, good luck with that.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.045
Is it fiancée now, too?

27:28.080 --> 27:30.013
Is it gonna break your heart
if I say yes?

27:30.048 --> 27:31.715
'Cause I should
probably tell you,

27:31.750 --> 27:33.050
I don't believe in polygamy.

27:33.085 --> 27:36.453
And Kensi would make
a terrible sister wife.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.724
That's probably why
she didn't want to talk to me.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.159
Yeah.
I mean, I just mentioned

27:42.194 --> 27:44.895
the word "subpoena," and
she practically ran out of here.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.301
Let me be perfectly clear
about this.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.303
You leave her out of it.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.907
Lucky for you,
I may not need her.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.210
Although,

28:00.245 --> 28:02.212
I guess that makes you unlucky.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.881
Doesn't it?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.954
Coffee's on me.

28:10.989 --> 28:14.024
When you get a chance,
you put on that bow tie,

28:14.059 --> 28:16.359
and maybe bring me back
a cappuccino.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.395
(exhales)

28:20.065 --> 28:21.398
Gonna tell me
what I'm doing here?

28:23.101 --> 28:25.202
(sighs)

28:25.237 --> 28:29.840
Well, I have bad news,
and I have worse news.

28:29.875 --> 28:30.807
You don't really seem
like the type

28:30.842 --> 28:32.109
who cares which one comes first.

28:32.144 --> 28:35.278
I'm the type of guy that
likes to get to the point.

28:35.313 --> 28:38.482
We found 500 pounds
of stolen explosives

28:38.517 --> 28:40.350
on your property,
Agent Callen.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.420
That the bad news?

28:43.455 --> 28:45.288
Well, that depends
on whether or not

28:45.323 --> 28:47.991
you consider us finding a dead
body in your garage worse.

28:49.094 --> 28:52.262
(sighs)

28:52.297 --> 28:54.164
Let me guess.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.866
Someone tipped you off.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.201
You seem like
the kind of person

28:58.236 --> 29:00.370
that's willing
to listen to reason.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.675
Try me.

29:09.548 --> 29:13.817
Look, we're both Federal agents.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.418
I don't steal explosives.

29:15.453 --> 29:18.155
And I certainly don't leave dead
bodies laying around my house.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.957
Then how do you explain how they
ended up on your property?

29:20.992 --> 29:22.926
The same way that narcotics
and a body showed up

29:22.961 --> 29:25.061
in my partner's trunk,
conveniently

29:25.096 --> 29:27.464
just before DEA showed
up looking for him.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.266
The body?

29:29.301 --> 29:31.101
I bet it was dead
more than 12 hours, wasn't it?

29:31.136 --> 29:34.404
Yeah. Clearly, it was
killed somewhere else.

29:34.439 --> 29:37.007
Just like the body
in my partner's trunk.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.542
T-This whole thing is a set-up.

29:40.579 --> 29:44.314
Sounds like a, uh,
convenient theory.

29:44.349 --> 29:47.083
Just look into it. Sam Hanna,

29:47.118 --> 29:49.452
Martin Deeks, Owen Granger--
all of us arrested

29:49.487 --> 29:51.922
on the same day by different
law enforcement agencies?

29:51.957 --> 29:55.292
Come on, this is
an attack on NCIS.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.028
My only concern, Agent Callen,
is you and your crime.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.095
Yeah, well,
it shouldn't be.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.463
Your job is to protect people.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.999
And the longer my team
and I are locked up,

30:03.034 --> 30:05.468
the more people that
are at risk, okay?

30:05.503 --> 30:08.172
You want that blood
on your hands?

30:10.275 --> 30:13.110
(sighs)

30:14.379 --> 30:18.148
Hetty, Heather's awake.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.417
It's about time.
Duggan is getting restless.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.219
It was my job

30:22.254 --> 30:26.122
to find the mole, and now,
everyone's paying the price.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.225
Is it possible
that Duggan is behind this?

30:28.260 --> 30:29.492
I mean, could this just be
part of his plan?

30:29.527 --> 30:32.028
NELL:
Excuse me.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.463
I just got an alert from County.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.631
Granger's been stabbed.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.099
KENSI:
What?!

30:36.134 --> 30:37.367
Oh, my God!
Is he alive?

30:37.402 --> 30:39.436
He's alive,
but it's not looking good.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.371
Mm.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.373
Everything all right, Henrietta?

30:45.577 --> 30:47.611
I need to talk to you.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.180
Henrietta, we've given you ample

30:50.215 --> 30:52.182
leeway up to
this point.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.017
You cannot talk your way
out of this.

30:54.052 --> 30:55.952
I have no intention
of doing that.

30:55.987 --> 30:57.387
But I do need
to speak

30:57.422 --> 31:00.023
with you, alone.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.197
An early friend and mentor

31:07.232 --> 31:09.532
always used to say that a woman

31:09.567 --> 31:12.135
is like a tea bag.

31:12.170 --> 31:16.306
You never know how strong she is
until she gets into hot water.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.345
So does that mean
she knew First Lady...?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.147
Yeah, I think so.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.416
Wow.

31:26.451 --> 31:30.020
(siren wailing)

31:36.194 --> 31:39.162
Come, sit down.

31:45.070 --> 31:49.106
I haven't been entirely honest
with you.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.476
Why am I not surprised?

31:54.346 --> 31:58.114
Owen Granger has been in police
custody since this morning.

31:58.149 --> 32:02.319
We just got word
that he was stabbed.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.255
Is he alive?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.456
For now.

32:06.491 --> 32:09.059
Meanwhile, three
of my agents

32:09.094 --> 32:13.363
are being held by different
agencies across the city.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.099
Now, if none of this
is news to you,

32:16.134 --> 32:18.501
then, bravo, you win.

32:18.536 --> 32:19.736
You think I'm behind this?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.504
Are you?

32:21.539 --> 32:23.139
No.

32:23.174 --> 32:26.410
Henrietta, why didn't you tell
me about any of this sooner?

32:27.746 --> 32:31.614
Because I didn't realize
what you have to gain

32:31.649 --> 32:34.617
until now.
I thought

32:34.652 --> 32:37.620
my career depended
on finding the mole.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.290
Now I realize...

32:40.325 --> 32:42.292
yours does.

32:42.327 --> 32:43.626
I don't follow.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.161
Taking me down

32:45.196 --> 32:47.998
would be big for your career.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.200
But not as big

32:50.235 --> 32:53.003
as finding the mole.

32:53.038 --> 32:55.672
(chuckles softly)

32:55.707 --> 32:59.242
I can't help you
unless I know everything.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.578
I agree.

33:01.613 --> 33:05.382
Fun fact:
I do not miss hospitals.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.416
NELL:
Mm.

33:06.451 --> 33:07.751
Just the food, right?

33:07.786 --> 33:10.120
Watch out, Jones.
I'll bring you takeout.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.392
Entering Heather's room now.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.429
Knock, knock.

33:19.464 --> 33:20.163
(exhales)

33:20.198 --> 33:22.098
I'm here to take you
to your MRI.

33:22.133 --> 33:25.201
No one mentioned an MRI to me.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.804
Well, um, it's right here
in your chart.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.539
But do not worry,

33:29.574 --> 33:31.808
you are in good hands.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.544
Here, let me help you.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.812
There you go.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.547
(exhales)

33:37.582 --> 33:40.050
I see you
didn't eat anything.

33:40.085 --> 33:43.053
I prefer to eat food.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.521
Yeah, we can agree on that.

33:44.556 --> 33:47.690
Here you go. Up.
(door opens)

33:47.725 --> 33:50.827
I need to see your I.D. before
you take the patient anywhere.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.396
(chuckles)
Well,

33:53.431 --> 33:55.799
unfortunately,
my previous patient got

33:55.834 --> 33:57.534
some unsanitary fluids on it,

33:57.569 --> 34:00.670
so, um, kind of waiting
for a new one. (chuckles)

34:00.705 --> 34:03.106
I can't let you out of here
without hospital credentials.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.508
Okay, if you insist,

34:05.543 --> 34:07.577
I can definitely bring it out
of the trash.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.713
But, um, you might need a mask
and some gloves

34:10.748 --> 34:12.582
and maybe
even a shower

34:12.617 --> 34:14.417
afterwards.
(chuckles)

34:14.452 --> 34:17.720
Sorry. No I.D., no exit.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.090
Mm. Okay, well,

34:20.125 --> 34:22.158
in that case,

34:22.193 --> 34:24.427
I'm sorry.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.095
(groans)

34:28.800 --> 34:30.400
Who are you?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.402
I'm here to protect you.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.803
(grunts)

34:33.838 --> 34:35.672
Do as I say,

34:35.707 --> 34:38.475
and you'll stay alive.

34:38.510 --> 34:39.476
Where are you taking me?

34:39.511 --> 34:40.877
I'm taking you
someplace safe.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.679
Tell me what the hell
is going on here.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.214
Heather,
I'm a Federal agent.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.849
We have credible intel
that there's a hit out on you.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.317
You got to trust me.

34:47.352 --> 34:49.319
Why on earth
should I trust you?

34:49.354 --> 34:51.755
You got no other choice.

34:52.857 --> 34:54.390
Thank you.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.892
Nell, we're leaving
the hospital.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.495
Okay, got it.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.864
All right, Heather.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.699
I'm gonna need
you to walk.

35:02.734 --> 35:03.833
(grunting)

35:03.868 --> 35:05.268
(tires screeching)

35:06.404 --> 35:06.870
Get down! Get down!

35:06.905 --> 35:08.738
(gunfire)

35:12.243 --> 35:14.878
Get in the car. Get in the car!

35:14.913 --> 35:16.446
Stay down!

35:20.418 --> 35:21.451
(tires screeching)

35:26.624 --> 35:28.825
NELL: Nice, Beale.
Way to sell the blanks.

35:30.428 --> 35:31.428
(coughs)

35:45.410 --> 35:46.877
DEEKS:
<i> Whiting!</i>

35:47.979 --> 35:49.913
Whiting!

35:51.482 --> 35:54.450
...176, 177!

35:54.485 --> 35:55.752
Feel the burn, Whiting!

35:57.255 --> 36:00.190
Whiting!

36:00.225 --> 36:01.591
I can do this all day!

36:01.626 --> 36:03.393
What do you want?

36:03.428 --> 36:04.727
Hey. Uh, Whiting.

36:04.762 --> 36:05.929
Where's Whiting?

36:05.964 --> 36:07.263
She's not here.

36:07.298 --> 36:08.464
Oh, okay.
What's your...

36:08.499 --> 36:09.732
what's your name again?

36:09.767 --> 36:11.601
Northam.
Yeah, it's written
on your badge.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.403
Listen, Northam,
can you, can you go grab

36:13.438 --> 36:15.471
the-the captain for me?
My captain?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.806
He's not available.
Yeah. Can...

36:16.841 --> 36:19.409
But if you could just...
All right, if you...

36:19.444 --> 36:22.179
It's nice to see
my tax dollars at work!

36:26.451 --> 36:28.818
Thought
you might be hungry.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.354
I don't want a sandwich.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.323
I want my phone call.

36:38.329 --> 36:39.863
Suit yourself.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.535
You're telling me one thing.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.870
The evidence is telling me
another.

36:47.905 --> 36:50.807
I've told you everything
you need to know.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.409
Well, then this is
gonna be a long night.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.278
I'll tell you what.

36:55.313 --> 36:56.746
You let me out of here,

36:56.781 --> 36:58.548
and I'll do my job.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.351
And yours.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.355
(steady pumping)

37:19.337 --> 37:22.472
Any chance of showing me some
mercy and getting rid of these?

37:22.507 --> 37:24.374
I don't think
I'm going anywhere

37:24.409 --> 37:27.277
fast in my current condition.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.945
Yeah, I can absolutely
help you out.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.880
As long as you help us out.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.252
We know you were
working with Natalie.

37:36.921 --> 37:40.723
We know Natalie was
working with Carl Brown.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.759
We also know that

37:42.794 --> 37:44.594
you're taking orders
from someone.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.796
What makes you so sure?

37:46.831 --> 37:48.932
'Cause that someone told you
to pin the attack on Granger.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.070
She presumably took
a beating for the cause.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.439
She may not be easy to break.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.441
And we don't have
much time.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.842
We also

37:59.877 --> 38:02.945
found evidence of
drugs at the scene.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.847
So we know that's how you got
Granger unconscious,

38:04.882 --> 38:06.549
so that you could take a
beating and frame it on him.

38:08.853 --> 38:10.887
Unless you have a
different explanation,

38:10.922 --> 38:12.155
I'm thinking it's time
to face up to the facts

38:12.190 --> 38:14.991
that whoever you're working for
no longer needs your services.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.926
And that, Heather,

38:16.961 --> 38:19.429
means you need
protection.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.997
We can protect you.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.932
Like you protected Granger?

38:22.967 --> 38:26.002
I just saved your ass.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.538
It'd be a lot easier to toss
you out on the street again.

38:28.573 --> 38:31.808
And, believe me, that's exactly
what I want to do right now.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.676
You didn't protect Natalie,
either.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.878
Who are you working for?

38:35.913 --> 38:38.581
It's not LAPD.
It's not DEA.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.483
It's not ATF. Another agency,

38:40.518 --> 38:41.951
perhaps?
An independent?

38:41.986 --> 38:43.619
Heather, you don't
cooperate with us,

38:43.654 --> 38:45.822
you are in pretty bad shape.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.557
You either end up in
high security prison,

38:47.592 --> 38:48.858
like Carl Brown,

38:48.893 --> 38:49.992
or like your friend Natalie,

38:50.027 --> 38:50.860
dead.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.364
Make a choice.

38:54.399 --> 38:57.834
So what's it gonna be?

39:02.940 --> 39:04.874
(tapping)

39:13.718 --> 39:15.752
What happened? Why did
Agent Blye stop questioning?

39:15.787 --> 39:18.788
Because I think we're
finally getting somewhere.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.126
I have nothing more to tell you.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.966
If you say so.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.870
(door opens)

39:35.640 --> 39:36.940
Hetty.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.079
She's working for the CIA.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.149
I feel as if the entire
alphabet is after us.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.750
Yeah.

39:47.785 --> 39:48.951
How do you know
she's with the CIA?

39:48.986 --> 39:49.952
Duggan, you should
really brush up

39:49.987 --> 39:51.020
on your Morse code.

39:53.458 --> 39:55.458
(beeping)
Oh,

39:55.493 --> 39:56.559
Fudgsicle.

39:56.594 --> 39:58.728
We got company.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.096
Mother Fudgsicle.

40:00.131 --> 40:03.099
Hetty, we have a problem.
We've been swatted.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.501
A tactical team is unloading
outside the boatshed as I speak.

40:05.536 --> 40:08.871
Oh, God.
Don't tell me. FBI.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.139
Who are they coming for now?

40:10.174 --> 40:12.041
It could be any one of us.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.209
This has gone way too far.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.577
I'll handle it.

40:14.612 --> 40:15.711
No, I will take care of this.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.913
It's time I do my job.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.455
I'm Under Secretary

40:25.490 --> 40:27.023
of Defense Corbin Duggan,
Stop right there!
Get your hands up!

40:27.058 --> 40:28.691
and I request
that you stand down.

40:28.726 --> 40:29.759
Hands up!
I'm in charge here.

40:29.794 --> 40:30.960
And I can explain
what's going on.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.995
(gunshot)
Sniper!

40:33.030 --> 40:34.030
Shots fired!
Cover!

40:35.833 --> 40:36.899
Oh, my God!

40:36.934 --> 40:38.701
What happened to Duggan?

40:38.736 --> 40:39.568
He's been shot.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.537
Medic!
All right,
full cover everywhere.

40:41.572 --> 40:42.939
Looks like it was a sniper.

40:42.974 --> 40:43.773
KENSI:
From where?

40:44.709 --> 40:45.875
Where did the shot

40:45.910 --> 40:46.642
come from, guys?

40:46.677 --> 40:48.144
I don't know.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.046
All right, move in, move in.
All right, let's go!

40:50.081 --> 40:52.014
Get him cover, cover.
Move! Move!

40:52.049 --> 40:53.483
Is he dead?

40:53.518 --> 40:54.717
We don't know.

40:54.752 --> 40:55.685
I didn't think it
could get any worse.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.053
Now they got Duggan?

40:57.088 --> 40:58.688
The one person
who could've helped us.

40:58.723 --> 41:00.089
What happens now?

41:00.124 --> 41:02.592
I don't know.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.159
(sighs)

41:08.633 --> 41:09.899
Get on that door.

41:09.934 --> 41:10.934
We got to get out of here.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.537
FBI!

41:14.572 --> 41:16.272
Only one way out.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.273
Bugger.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.242
This is a brand-new suit.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.744
Go! Move! Get in!

41:21.779 --> 41:23.079
Break right!
Break right!

41:23.114 --> 41:25.047
FBI!

41:25.082 --> 41:25.849
Full sweep!
You go with him!

41:27.885 --> 41:29.819
Hands up!
Stay down.

41:29.854 --> 41:31.020
Clear!
Yeah!

41:31.055 --> 41:32.255
AGENT:
Two left clear!

41:32.290 --> 41:34.090
AGENT 2:
Clear on the right!

41:34.125 --> 41:36.192
Clear.
Clear!

41:36.227 --> 41:37.961
Watch her.

41:40.164 --> 41:41.797
Commander!

41:41.832 --> 41:44.567
You need to see this!

41:44.602 --> 41:46.135
AGENT:
Secure the premises!

41:49.340 --> 41:50.540
AGENT:
Secure all the other exits!
