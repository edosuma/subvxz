The CIA put Eleanor back on the street,

00:09.719 --> 00:11.336
and either you don't know jack shit

00:11.421 --> 00:12.920
about it, or you're in on it.

00:13.006 --> 00:14.172
Are you gonna shut down the pipeline?

00:14.224 --> 00:15.482
BUCKLEY: I'm working on it.

00:15.508 --> 00:17.175
You'd better, because the last thing we need

00:17.227 --> 00:18.476
is to be called in front of Congress.

00:18.511 --> 00:20.728
I want my daughter back

00:20.814 --> 00:22.180
and Fausto dead.

00:22.265 --> 00:24.515
We all want that.

What, did he give it to you?

00:51.594 --> 00:53.711
We kind of... broke in and took it?

00:55.382 --> 00:57.298
FRYE: They're the same maps.

00:57.384 --> 00:59.183
SONYA: But Eleanor's has GPS coordinates.

00:59.219 --> 01:00.385
FRYE: Let's get out there.

01:00.437 --> 01:02.387
You take the van, I got the semi.

01:46.884 --> 01:48.467
I'm going to pull it over.

01:48.493 --> 01:50.647
Goddamn it, Sonya, no.
You'll wait for backup.

- shitball threat?
- No.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.211
But this is.

08:35.263 --> 08:36.546
I can arrange it

08:36.597 --> 08:38.264
so that your partner finds
your body in the morning.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.688
Overdose.

08:39.714 --> 08:41.017

no one's gonna bat an eyelid.

Now, if she's smart...
and-and I think she is...

08:45.557 --> 08:47.106
she's gonna put this little story

08:47.192 --> 08:48.558
you've been working on in a drawer

08:48.610 --> 08:50.476
and forget about it,
'cause if she doesn't...

08:50.562 --> 08:52.028
Well, you know, maybe she tries

08:52.063 --> 08:54.023
to hurt herself again,
like she did two years ago.

08:54.032 --> 08:56.783
Only this time, she succeeds.

08:57.543 --> 08:59.477
What, you didn't know about that?

09:00.106 --> 09:02.239
What exactly do you think is going on here?

09:02.274 --> 09:05.123
Well, I-I think the CIA is
at war with the DEA.

09:05.149 --> 09:07.673
I think you guys got a bunch of
covert operations that are funneling

09:07.699 --> 09:09.532
drug money into the
United States of America.

09:09.584 --> 09:10.533
What you're getting back for it

09:10.585 --> 09:12.368
I-I don't exactly know,

09:12.420 --> 09:14.086
but I'm gonna figure it out.
And I'm pretty sure

09:14.172 --> 09:15.504
you call yourself a patriot,

09:15.540 --> 09:16.672
and you tell yourself that you're managing

09:16.708 --> 09:17.873
a drug war, that you are

09:17.959 --> 09:20.042
keeping the blood on the
other side of the border.

09:20.094 --> 09:21.210
The whole thing

09:21.262 --> 09:22.461

09:23.965 --> 09:25.758
Everything except the game part.

09:25.784 --> 09:27.410
This isn't a game, Daniel,

09:27.449 --> 09:29.719
it's a business, and we have an investment

09:29.771 --> 09:30.970
in that business.

09:31.055 --> 09:33.389
- Oh, so it's all about money?
- No shit.

09:33.441 --> 09:36.637
You see, if we keep doing our job right,

09:36.663 --> 09:39.483
then, you know, well, life just goes on.

09:40.092 --> 09:42.198
You know, the DEA

09:42.233 --> 09:43.649
- keep busting drug shipments...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on!

09:43.735 --> 09:46.035
And, you know, posing for pictures.

09:46.070 --> 09:48.154
The Mexicans blame the Yankees,

09:48.239 --> 09:49.719
white folk worry about the brown folk,

09:49.741 --> 09:51.407

09:52.994 --> 09:54.043
Does anyone care about the truth?

09:54.078 --> 09:55.044
Here's the truth:

09:55.079 --> 09:57.413
you're a drunk.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.548
You got fired from a third-rate paper.

09:59.584 --> 10:01.884
No one's gonna believe your shit

10:01.919 --> 10:02.919

10:09.594 --> 10:12.595
kind of in the middle of
something right now...

10:12.680 --> 10:14.063

10:15.652 --> 10:18.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I copy.

10:19.103 --> 10:20.069

10:20.104 --> 10:21.687

10:23.107 --> 10:25.574

10:26.944 --> 10:27.860

10:27.945 --> 10:28.911

10:28.946 --> 10:30.946

12:19.830 --> 12:22.627
El Paso PD. Down on the ground!

12:25.696 --> 12:27.196
Give me your jacket.

12:27.231 --> 12:28.197
What?

12:28.232 --> 12:30.330
Your jacket, dipshit.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.750
- What are you doing?
-- What does it look like?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.979
Want me to put her with Chico here?

12:48.553 --> 12:49.418
Nah...

12:49.470 --> 12:51.170
It's bad luck to kill a cop.

12:57.595 --> 13:02.014
I need removals ASAP.

13:02.099 --> 13:04.099

13:06.938 --> 13:09.271
Yes, I can hold.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.188

13:17.281 --> 13:19.365

13:22.036 --> 13:24.003

13:29.794 --> 13:31.293
(whispering): There will be work to do

13:31.345 --> 13:32.595
when Fausto's dead.

13:32.630 --> 13:35.130
Of course.

13:36.634 --> 13:38.634
(wry laugh)

13:43.474 --> 13:46.070
Can I ask what you plan to do with him?

13:47.054 --> 13:48.911
Do you really want to know?

13:48.937 --> 13:51.780
After all the trouble
getting him for you, yes.

13:54.358 --> 13:55.857
I'll take him home...

13:58.037 --> 13:59.870
to the oak tree.

14:33.741 --> 14:35.741

14:38.162 --> 14:39.912

- Hey...

16:13.762 --> 16:14.844
(car door closes)

16:14.930 --> 16:15.845
Buckley was here.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.512
- Yeah?
- There was a body.

16:17.538 --> 16:19.854
One of the drivers from crossroads.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.430
They shot him and... (sighs)

16:21.492 --> 16:22.858
What's he doing here?

16:22.910 --> 16:24.026
(sighs) He's on our side.

16:24.052 --> 16:25.752
- No, he's not.
- ADLER: Okay.

16:25.778 --> 16:27.278
You said there was a body, where?

16:29.033 --> 16:30.466
(sighs) Right here.

16:30.534 --> 16:31.700
All right,

16:31.752 --> 16:33.085
Buckley came up behind me...

16:33.170 --> 16:34.336
knocked me down.

16:34.372 --> 16:35.454
And you are <i> sure</i> it's him?

16:35.539 --> 16:36.922
Yes! I'm sure!

16:37.008 --> 16:39.208
Okay, okay.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.403
We'll have our crime scene
techs take a look at it.

16:41.429 --> 16:42.711
What the hell is going on?

16:43.848 --> 16:45.381
Go ahead and tell her.

16:45.466 --> 16:46.849
(sighs)

16:46.884 --> 16:48.350
You stumbled on the pipeline.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.185
Two weeks ago,

16:50.221 --> 16:51.804
I got a call from Agent McKenzie,

16:51.889 --> 16:53.222
saying that he had evidence

16:53.274 --> 16:55.641
that the CIA was helping Fausto

16:55.726 --> 16:57.226
smuggle heroin across the border.

16:57.311 --> 16:58.310
We know that.

16:58.396 --> 16:59.528
When the banks crashed,

16:59.563 --> 17:02.064
somebody at the CIA floated the idea

17:02.116 --> 17:03.615
of flushing dye into the system;

17:03.701 --> 17:05.534
see where the money ended up.

17:05.569 --> 17:06.535
They thought they could

17:06.569 --> 17:09.097
control it... they couldn't... it happens.

17:09.123 --> 17:10.622
(whispering): And you knew about this?

17:10.708 --> 17:11.740
Hey. Hey. Hey.

17:11.826 --> 17:13.242
You know, you might want
to get that looked at.

17:13.327 --> 17:16.239
I'm gonna make sure that someone
is being held responsible for this.

17:16.265 --> 17:17.714
Sonya, come on, come on,

17:17.767 --> 17:19.435
let's go talk to Linder. Come on.

17:19.461 --> 17:21.637
- This is bullshit.
- Yeah, it's bullshit.

17:29.562 --> 17:30.895
(sniffs)

17:32.815 --> 17:34.782
(Romina grunting, panting)

17:34.867 --> 17:36.400
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah.

17:36.486 --> 17:37.726
Romina, Romina, Romina, Romina.

17:37.737 --> 17:38.630
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I love these things.

20:32.411 --> 20:34.745
These things are hours of good times.

20:34.830 --> 20:35.829
You're drunk.

20:35.915 --> 20:37.331
- I am not.
- Bullshit!

20:37.416 --> 20:39.249
This morning I'm just,

20:39.335 --> 20:40.634
I'm just kind of buzzed. That's all.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.170
I have somebody willing to
go on record about Buckley.

20:43.255 --> 20:44.922
Oh, the CIA doesn't go on record.

20:44.999 --> 20:46.791
They just break in your
house and burn your shit.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.092
They reached out to me.

20:48.144 --> 20:49.422
Really?

20:49.448 --> 20:51.228
You reach out to my friend
at <i> Border Blog?</i>

20:51.263 --> 20:53.495
It is on my list of things to do.

20:53.521 --> 20:55.599
You should; we need a place to publish this.

20:55.651 --> 20:57.234
Oh, yeah, we're gonna blog?
This is what we do now?

20:57.269 --> 20:58.343
We're-we're bloggers?

20:58.369 --> 21:00.487
They get more hits than this place.
They're not afraid.

21:00.573 --> 21:01.655
They're not afraid 'cause

21:01.741 --> 21:03.273
they live in their mother's basement.

21:03.325 --> 21:04.274
That is where bloggers are bred.

21:04.326 --> 21:05.442

21:05.528 --> 21:06.777
You're drunk and stupid.

21:06.862 --> 21:08.162
I am not stupid.

21:08.247 --> 21:09.747

21:09.782 --> 21:10.781
Okay.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.783
But I am bringing my ball.

<i>We need to know</i> how you
ended up in that truck.

21:20.926 --> 21:24.378
I was in Juárez.

21:24.463 --> 21:26.013
Trying to find a girl.

21:26.098 --> 21:28.132
What girl? Eva?

21:28.184 --> 21:31.602
No... a woman in trouble

21:31.637 --> 21:34.188
with a violent man.

21:34.273 --> 21:37.191
I was trying to... take her out of there.

21:37.276 --> 21:39.560
It was...

21:39.586 --> 21:41.064
nothing unusual.

21:41.090 --> 21:44.891
Except you tripped across a
billion dollars of heroin, Steven.

21:45.201 --> 21:49.083
I have no idea how I got in that truck.

21:49.109 --> 21:51.681
Did those drugs belong to Fausto Galvan?

21:51.707 --> 21:53.624

can I get to my statement?

27:47.407 --> 27:48.156
She's got a statement.

27:48.242 --> 27:50.375
About your story.

27:50.410 --> 27:52.661
What do you think our story is?

27:52.746 --> 27:55.463
Agent Buckley is, um...

27:55.549 --> 27:56.631
a sick man.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.584
His psychiatric problems have

27:59.636 --> 28:02.160
evolved over the last few months.

28:02.186 --> 28:05.187
We're still trying to
determine the extent of it.

28:06.593 --> 28:08.643
That's your statement?

28:08.729 --> 28:10.478
For now. Yes.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.981
You're wasting our time.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.350
You've been running Buckley
the whole time, haven't you?

28:15.435 --> 28:17.102
No.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.654
Agent Buckley was operating
without my knowledge.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.690
I doubt that.

28:21.775 --> 28:23.859
Where's Buckley now?

28:28.749 --> 28:31.616
He's being evaluated.

28:33.954 --> 28:36.788
We got to find Buckley.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.800
Any sign of the Marines?

28:48.852 --> 28:51.435
No. I came the way you said.

28:51.461 --> 28:53.094
- Good.
- Where's Fausto?

28:53.188 --> 28:56.523
Inside. Come.

28:56.549 --> 28:57.765
Does anyone know you're here?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.934
No. I didn't tell anyone.

29:11.030 --> 29:13.898
What about Robles?

29:13.983 --> 29:16.422
Robles can't touch me anymore.

29:16.448 --> 29:19.796
I'm taking her to a hospital,

29:19.822 --> 29:20.815

29:20.841 --> 29:23.791

- Eleanor works for him.

42:36.376 --> 42:38.376
(both grunting)

42:51.691 --> 42:53.558
SONYA: Stop!

42:53.643 --> 42:55.359
Now.

43:04.788 --> 43:06.904
It's over, Eleanor.

43:07.016 --> 43:08.149
Put up your hands.

43:10.794 --> 43:11.826
Now.

43:15.749 --> 43:17.081
You can kill me.

43:18.101 --> 43:20.151
Go ahead, shoot.

43:33.066 --> 43:35.066
I'm not gonna do that.

43:36.569 --> 43:38.936
I would.

43:40.323 --> 43:43.074
I'm not like you.

43:57.006 --> 43:59.757
Marco?

43:59.793 --> 44:01.959
I need your help.

44:06.182 --> 44:07.765
Thanks for coming.

44:07.801 --> 44:09.767
Yeah, of course.

44:09.803 --> 44:11.803
Who's that?

44:11.855 --> 44:12.937
Her father.

44:12.972 --> 44:14.806
Did you kill him?

44:17.060 --> 44:19.336
You could've just let them
kill each other, you know.

44:20.843 --> 44:23.010
I didn't think about that.

44:23.036 --> 44:24.952
You taking her to El Paso?

44:31.658 --> 44:34.792
They're gonna fire me when
they find out what I did.

44:36.079 --> 44:38.079
They can't find out.

44:44.088 --> 44:47.756
I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.

44:48.474 --> 44:51.008
I have some ideas.

44:53.847 --> 44:56.681
You can grab her.

44:56.766 --> 44:58.733
Put her in the car.

45:03.022 --> 45:04.555
I'll take care of Daddy.
