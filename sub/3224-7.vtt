00:03.640 --> 00:05.400
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can!

00:05.440 --> 00:07.010
Now, Dean, go!

00:07.120 --> 00:08.246
What else do you remember?

00:08.480 --> 00:09.891
Nothing, I was a kid, all right?

00:10.080 --> 00:12.287
- Most importantly...
- Watch out for Sammy.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.601
Watching out for you
is kind of who I am.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.604
I got this brother, right?
And he's always telling me

00:17.720 --> 00:19.324
how he's going to
watch out for me.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.720
Now, eat your dinner.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.126
Don't forget your vegetables.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.368
Don't you dare
think that there is anything

00:24.520 --> 00:26.329
that I would
put in front of you!

00:26.440 --> 00:28.442
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.240
I heal Sam
while healing myself.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.210
Every time I use my power
it weakens me.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.771
You went
through the trials.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.564
I just think it's better
if you took it easy, you know,

00:36.760 --> 00:39.286
- and didn't act like you were...
- Possessed by an angel.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.806
Wait up!

00:50.920 --> 00:53.082
Hurry, he's right behind us!

00:59.840 --> 01:01.524
Come on, come on!

01:02.680 --> 01:04.125
Hurry!

01:07.120 --> 01:09.441
Go, go. Close it.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.523
Come on, guys.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.685
The barn is a no-fly zone
during Hide and Go Seek.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.889
Boys!

01:34.040 --> 01:36.122
Come on, you delinquents.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.810
Time for bed!

01:39.360 --> 01:42.603
All right.
Game's over, boys.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.484
Let's bring it in!

01:44.640 --> 01:46.642
And lights out
was ten minutes ago.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.160
You little bastards.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.089
Okay, I'm gonna...

01:59.920 --> 02:02.491
You got till the count of ten

02:02.640 --> 02:04.563
and you better come out
or the belt's coming off!

02:06.600 --> 02:07.600
one!

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
Come on!

02:16.800 --> 02:18.040
Boys?

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
Come on!

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
This isn't funny!

03:01.440 --> 03:02.930
Dean?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.131
Kevin?

03:43.040 --> 03:44.280
Hello.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.682
I'm sorry, there's no, uh...
there's no D-Dawg...

03:47.840 --> 03:49.046
Here, I got it, I got it.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.128
Sonny.
Hey, so, what's up?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.564
Okay.

03:55.720 --> 03:59.042
All right, yeah, just sit tight.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.526
Yeah.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.323
So, what was
that all about, D-Dawg?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.560
You remember when we were kids,

04:06.800 --> 04:08.882
that spring in upstate New York?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.651
Dad was on a Rugaru hunt,
we crashed at the, uh...

04:11.680 --> 04:13.808
at the Bungalow Colony
with the ping-pong table?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.205
Yeah. You disappeared.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.519
Dad came back, you were gone.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.204
He shipped me off to Bobby's
for a couple months.

04:18.279 --> 04:19.725
And went and found you,

04:19.880 --> 04:21.483
you were lost
on a hunt or something.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.286
That's what we told you. Right.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.764
I'm sorry,
that's what you told me?

04:29.080 --> 04:31.048
Truth is, um...

04:31.200 --> 04:33.885
I lost the food money that Dad
left for us in a card game.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.645
I knew you'd get hungry, so...

04:35.800 --> 04:39.088
I tried taking the five-finger discount
at the local market and got busted.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.249
I wasn't on a hunt.
They sent me to a boys' home.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.607
A boy's home,
like a reform school?

04:45.840 --> 04:46.887
Yeah, more or less.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.321
It was a farm and the guy
who ran it, Sonny...

04:49.480 --> 04:51.687
he, you know,
he looked after me.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.689
Wait, does Sonny know
what we do?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.484
Yeah.
He's good people.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.210
I gave him the number
to the Bat phone...

04:57.400 --> 05:01.007
and sounds like he's got something
in our wheel-house, so...

05:01.200 --> 05:02.645
Hey.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.927
You gonna be cool to do this
or are you too tired?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.203
No, yeah, I'm just...
I'll be fine.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.249
And everybody's okay with
heading out to the Catskills?

05:15.680 --> 05:17.523
I am everybody.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.681
Yeah.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.610
Right, all right.
Grab your stuff, we'll head out.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.205
Hey, Dean.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.767
I mean, why didn't you just...

05:25.880 --> 05:27.370
tell me you
went to a boys' home?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.284
I don't know.
It was Dad's idea.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.726
And then, it just...

05:30.760 --> 05:32.603
you know, the story
became the story.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.290
I was 16.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.641
You were here for two months
and Dad couldn't find you?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.131
Oh, no, he found me.
He found me quick.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.209
But he left me here,
because I lost our money.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.084
You were 16, you made a mistake.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.128
Yeah, I made the mistake.
Look, I know how you think.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.486
None of this was Dad's fault.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.965
Hi.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.804
What can I do for you boys?

06:22.960 --> 06:24.849
I'm Dean,
this is my brother Sam.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.162
We're old buddies of Sonny's.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.050
Prison buddies?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.650
No.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.245
You mind telling him
that we're here?

06:36.720 --> 06:38.210
I'll go get him.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.891
I just mopped this floor,
so you take off those roach-stompers.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.329
Sonny's an ex-con, huh?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.767
Oh, what, and we're such angels?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.808
Trust me,
he's more than made up for it.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.883
Steven Hewlett
caught him red-handed,

07:05.040 --> 07:07.088
- stealing up at his store.
- So what did he take?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.521
Get this,
peanut butter and bread.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.681
Okay.
And how about family?

07:13.840 --> 07:15.410
Well, his old man called.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.848
Once he found out what happened,
he said, "Let him rot in jail."

07:19.120 --> 07:20.360
Judge is off on a fishing trip,

07:20.480 --> 07:21.845
boy's too young
to leave in County,

07:21.960 --> 07:24.566
so I thought it best
he stay here till arraignment.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.245
Don't see why not, man.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.366
Appreciate it, Sonny.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.960
Where'd you get the shiner?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.929
- You think that's funny?
- No, I think you're slow.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.206
- You sucker-punched me!
- You wish!

07:35.360 --> 07:37.886
Come on, now.
Bill, I got this, buddy.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.724
It's all right.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.289
You shouldn't do that, kid.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.448
Yeah, why, because he's a cop?

07:48.640 --> 07:51.246
Because when you make him mad...

07:51.360 --> 07:52.805
he leaves with the key.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.130
Don't sweat it.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.923
Deputy do that?

08:12.080 --> 08:14.447
Then what, your old man?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.290
Well, then how'd you get it?

08:16.520 --> 08:17.646
Werewolf.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.725
Okay.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.291
So, how do you know
I won't just run away?

08:38.440 --> 08:42.445
- Because you're hungry.
- No, I'm not.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.648
Well, then, Why'd you
steal bread and peanut butter?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.803
So, what is this place, anyway?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.408
It's for boys like you.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.930
You work the land.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.162
Teaches you some discipline
and responsibility.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.243
Keep you out of trouble.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.567
That's lame.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.841
Beats jail.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.087
Come on.
I'll fix you something to eat.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.691
- D-Dawg!
- Sonny.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.360
- Good to see you.
- You, too, brother.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.402
Oh, and this must be Sam.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.528
- Good to meet you.
- Back at you, brother.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.768
So, farm looks, uh... nice.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.450
Oh, please, man,
it's barely standing.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.600
Only got a handful of kids
working around here now.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.200
- Why's that?
- Because these days...

09:28.240 --> 09:30.971
the system would rather
incarcerate a boy than redeem him.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.010
Hey, Sonny,
you mind if we talk alone?

09:36.800 --> 09:39.770
Hey, Ruth, would you
please go check on the boys?

09:39.920 --> 09:41.800
Make sure their morning chores
are getting done?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.047
All right.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.326
So, what's happening?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.205
Well, you remember
Jack, don't you?

09:50.320 --> 09:51.970
Yeah, the tough old leatherneck.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.731
Mm-hmm. Well, somehow,
that ancient, rusty,

09:54.800 --> 09:56.689
broken-down tractor
just roared to life

09:56.720 --> 09:58.324
and ran him over
the other night.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.126
Maybe it just
slipped out of park or something.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.403
Couldn't have.
You know, I never believed

10:05.640 --> 10:08.849
in any of this mumbo-jumbo stuff
you boys are into, but...

10:09.040 --> 10:11.486
- something ain't right.
- What do you mean?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.160
Well, just
things started happening.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.770
You know,
lights flickering on and off,

10:15.880 --> 10:18.804
strange scratching sounds
coming from inside the walls.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.160
Windows and doors slamming.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.201
You think you can
round up the boys,

10:21.240 --> 10:22.207
while we take a look around?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.280
That shouldn't be a problem,
most are home on break.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.643
Well, except those
with no home worth going to.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.446
Why don't you take the house,
I'll check out the barn.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.561
Yep.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.840
Hey, I am so sorry.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.089
I thought I saw something, and...

11:34.240 --> 11:35.241
Like a ghost?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.363
Sonny told me
you were old friends,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.403
but I know
why you're really here.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.925
That's why I was praying for us.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.320
Praying for what?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.321
For the ghost that haunts
this farm to leave.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.089
All right, Casper.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.005
Where you at?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.040
Hello?

13:06.040 --> 13:07.201
Anybody here?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.323
Hey, kid, what are you doing
in here by yourself?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.403
Fighting monsters.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.965
What kind of monsters?

13:22.120 --> 13:25.602
All sorts, with Bruce
the Monster-Smasher.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.246
Hmm.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.687
Is that a cape?

13:31.840 --> 13:34.161
Little impractical
for smashing monsters, huh?

13:34.320 --> 13:37.483
- You know, you could choke...
- I clobber evil!

13:38.320 --> 13:40.004
Yeah, I bet you do.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.086
I'm Dean.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.407
Timmy.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.489
Let's try that again.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.005
You're gonna be a man,

13:53.080 --> 13:55.208
you got to learn
how to shake like one, okay?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.688
So give me
your best kung fu grip.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.842
Good. Now look me
straight in the eye,

14:00.960 --> 14:02.320
let me know
that you mean business.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.970
Shake as hard as you can.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.120
That's it.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.764
You shake like that,
you'll be all right.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.287
Hey, Timmy, did you know Jack
who worked here?

14:13.600 --> 14:14.761
Mm-hmm.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.651
What can you tell me about him?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.405
He yelled a lot.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.284
He was yelling
when he had his accident.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.249
How do you know that?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.526
Because me and the other boys

14:24.600 --> 14:27.285
were playing here
when it happened.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.801
And did you see anything?

14:30.680 --> 14:31.727
Is there anything else
about that night

14:31.800 --> 14:33.643
that you can remember,
anything at all?

14:36.280 --> 14:38.203
It suddenly...

14:38.280 --> 14:40.044
got really cold.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
Can I go?

14:42.920 --> 14:45.321
I have to finish my chores
before Miss Ruth gets mad.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.041
Yeah, that Ruth,
she runs a tight ship, huh?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.121
Yeah, you better roll.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.167
I grew up in this town.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.210
I used to come up here
as a little girl.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.687
The Wasserlaufs,
Howard and Doreen...

15:03.960 --> 15:06.531
...they used to own this farm
back then.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.489
My co-worker Jack...

15:08.600 --> 15:10.170
may he rest in peace.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.003
He worked here as a farmhand.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.766
Howard was a nice man, but...

15:15.960 --> 15:18.281
Well, he'd get into
that corn liquor, and...

15:18.520 --> 15:19.965
One night, he got it
into his thick skull

15:20.000 --> 15:23.482
that Jack and his wife Doreen
were rolling around in the hay.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.641
It wasn't true, but...

15:25.360 --> 15:27.806
But Howard's paranoia
got the better of him.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.286
He tried to kill them both.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.728
Jack got away, but Doreen...

15:34.880 --> 15:36.530
He killed her?

15:36.680 --> 15:37.841
With a meat cleaver.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.161
Got life in jail.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.442
Which, for Howard,
ended a year ago.

15:47.520 --> 15:51.206
He always swore he'd get
his revenge on poor old Jack, and...

15:53.360 --> 15:55.089
...looks like he finally got it.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.769
Is Howard buried here in town?

16:01.960 --> 16:02.960
So...

16:05.400 --> 16:07.846
Dad didn't want you to tell me.

16:07.960 --> 16:08.768
How come?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.570
Was this place really so bad?

16:10.600 --> 16:13.843
I don't really remember.
Look, nobody bad-touched me,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.320
nobody burned me
with their smokes

16:15.400 --> 16:17.368
or beat me with a metal hanger.
I call that a win.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.444
Hey.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.689
All right, let's barbecue
Old McDonald here...

16:38.840 --> 16:40.888
get the hell out of Dodge.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.131
Ruth, you okay?
What's wrong?

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
Open up!

17:44.360 --> 17:45.360
Ruth!

18:07.000 --> 18:09.446
That's fine.
That's okay.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.640
There it is.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.807
You know I'm fine just grabbing
a burger to go somewhere, right?

18:14.880 --> 18:17.804
What, and miss out on the best
banana pancakes you ever had?

18:19.000 --> 18:19.683
Thanks.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.484
No prob,
I do this for all the boys,

18:21.520 --> 18:23.648
after they been here
for a month.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.723
I meant for getting the charges
against me dropped.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.370
Well, being hungry
is not a crime,

18:27.400 --> 18:31.246
it's the stealing that is.
But I feel if you only do that once...

18:31.440 --> 18:33.090
you don't deserve a record.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.285
And seeing as how we can't
find your pops anywhere,

18:37.480 --> 18:39.403
you can stay here
as long as you want, Dean.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.249
You're doing good in school,
you're making friends,

18:44.320 --> 18:46.163
you made the wrestling team.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.646
I'm proud of you.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.882
Let me ask you something...

18:55.080 --> 18:57.082
and I want you to be
straight with me.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.328
Are you into the whole
heavy metal,

18:59.400 --> 19:01.528
devil-worshipping stuff?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.569
What? No.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.649
Hey, I'm not judging.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.406
It's just I found a few
occult-looking symbols

19:08.440 --> 19:10.124
carved into your bedpost.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.611
It's a very long story.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.728
That story have anything to do
with why you put salt

19:16.960 --> 19:18.485
in front of your bunk door
every night before bed?

19:18.640 --> 19:21.689
Well, it's a family thing,
so I can't really talk about it.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.171
Same family that left you here?

19:30.600 --> 19:33.285
What are you,
in the Mob or something?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.766
More like something.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.322
I was part of this gang, right?

19:43.440 --> 19:44.805
They were my family.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.371
I lived, breathed
I would've even died for them.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.169
You know where it got me?

19:50.320 --> 19:53.085
Fifteen years
in a correctional facility.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.531
And for what...

19:54.600 --> 19:57.490
being loyal? To who?

19:58.480 --> 20:00.642
I should've been
loyal to myself.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.962
Because you get one shot
at this game, Dean.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.963
And when you look in the mirror,

20:05.040 --> 20:08.408
you want the guy looking back
at you to be his own man.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.050
Hey, GUYS-

20:10.160 --> 20:11.605
- Hey, Robin, how are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

20:11.640 --> 20:12.687
Good.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.001
Meet my new
ranch foreman here, Dean.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.760
Welcome to Cus's.
What can I get you two?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.201
Bet you never thought
you'd see me here, huh?

20:23.480 --> 20:25.240
Uh, look, I'm a little bit
slammed right now.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.930
Do you guys
want to hear the specials?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.248
Robin.
Dean Winchester.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.166
Um...

20:32.320 --> 20:35.483
- Used to live up at Sonny's.
- Oh. Oh, uh...

20:35.560 --> 20:37.244
Look, sorry, there's just...
there's so many boys

20:37.400 --> 20:39.004
that pass through there,
it's hard to remember every...

20:39.200 --> 20:40.486
every name and face.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.489
Yeah, uh...
No, sorry, I just...

20:45.680 --> 20:47.170
remember you coming up there
with your morn,

20:47.320 --> 20:49.527
and she'd give guitar lessons.
It was a long time ago.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.160
Yeah, Mom, she loved
helping out the boys.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.244
I guess that's why I kept
giving lessons after she passed.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.129
Hey, Robin?

21:01.320 --> 21:02.880
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.489
- Dude!
- Let's go.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.850
Wha...

21:10.000 --> 21:11.843
- What was that?
- Nothing.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
Nothing?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.287
Well, obviously,
it was something.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.124
- Who was that waitress?
- I said it was nothing, all right?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.043
Drop it. Sonny.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.285
What?

21:24.320 --> 21:25.520
I tried to get in to save her,

21:25.640 --> 21:27.244
but the damn door wouldn't open.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
Locked?

21:29.920 --> 21:31.080
There's no locks on the farm.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.565
Means our little field trip
to the cemetery was a bust.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.402
Sonny, is there anything else
weird you can remember?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.044
Because we're not chest-deep
in weird already, boys?

21:40.120 --> 21:42.487
No, I know, I know.
I mean anything, really.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.608
There was one thing.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.491
Ruth always had her
rosary beads with her.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.449
But now I can't find them anywhere.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.321
All right.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.568
Let's start with the vics, okay?
I mean, both lived in the house.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.768
They both
worked closely with the boys.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.765
Why don't I go have a chat
with the rugrats, see what's up.

21:58.960 --> 21:59.563
Yeah.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.722
Sonny, you got any employee
records on the victims?

22:01.920 --> 22:04.207
In my office. Let's do it.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.730
Come on.
What you gonna do about it?

22:06.760 --> 22:07.761
You gonna cry?

22:07.840 --> 22:09.490
Timmy,
you're such a little weirdo.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
Hey, hey, hey!

22:10.680 --> 22:13.251
Hey, what are you doing?
Come here.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.486
- Huh?
- Nothing.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.045
Timmy, what's going on?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.166
All right, you two.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.520
Where were you this morning,
when Ruth had her accident?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.165
Unless you're a cop,

22:24.320 --> 22:25.680
we don't need
to tell you anything.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.041
Oh. Okay, well...

22:29.000 --> 22:30.490
How about that?

22:33.840 --> 22:35.683
We weren't even here
this morning.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.728
Sonny sent us into town
to get some chicken feed.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.211
We swear.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.601
What about Ruth?
What can you tell me about her?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.491
We used to call her the warden.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.608
She was a real
Bible-thumping hard-ass.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.371
Obviously.
What else?

22:49.520 --> 22:51.682
Anything different
or weird you can think of?

22:51.800 --> 22:53.165
You mean, besides Timmy?

22:53.240 --> 22:55.208
Hey.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.603
Either of you touch him,
ever again,

22:59.800 --> 23:01.290
I'm gonna go
all Guantanamo on you.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.091
Understand me?
Now get the hell out of here.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Go on, get!

23:10.680 --> 23:11.680
Hey.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.445
You and Bruce okay?

23:14.560 --> 23:15.846
Yeah.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.771
Listen to me.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.771
Guys like that,
they're cowards. Okay?

23:20.960 --> 23:22.760
All you got to do is stand up
to them one time

23:22.800 --> 23:24.689
and they'll stop, I promise.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.046
Okay.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.611
Hey, Sonny, wait.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.561
Um...

23:34.760 --> 23:36.205
What is all this?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.009
That's our hall of fame.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.882
We had some pretty great athletes
come through here.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.044
- Including your brother.
- Huh.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.847
He was Sullivan County
135-pound wrestling champion.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.211
Hey, guys.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.280
She could give me
a lesson anytime.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.005
Bro, she's, like, ancient.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.720
What the hell?

24:35.720 --> 24:37.609
What's this doing in here?

24:37.640 --> 24:38.880
I don't know.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.965
Kid's gonna need about
8,000 stitches, but he'll be fine.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.442
That kid was bullying Timmy
before the accident, right?

25:30.680 --> 25:32.205
Yeah. Why?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.606
Check this out.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.290
Timmy was found in
an abandoned building,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.004
about a year ago,
all by himself.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.367
No one was sure
how long he had been there.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.407
What about his parents?

25:40.440 --> 25:42.169
Well, they posted
a picture on the Internet,

25:42.240 --> 25:43.730
but no one ever showed up.

25:43.960 --> 25:44.927
Well, then,
what's he doing here?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.200
Shouldn't he be in an orphanage?

25:46.240 --> 25:47.730
He kept running away
from Child Services.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.802
So about three months ago,
Sonny offered to take him in.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.962
All right, so,
hard-ass counselors, bullies,

25:52.040 --> 25:54.441
all bite the dust,
but Timmy's still standing.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.442
So what are we talking?

25:55.520 --> 25:56.521
We got ourselves
a Damien on our hands?

25:56.600 --> 26:01.401
No, EMF rules out a demon,
so probably ghost possession.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.483
Meaning, what?
We find Timmy

26:03.680 --> 26:06.763
and shove a fistful of salt
down his throat? Forced ejection?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.925
You're taking
the barn this time.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.568
So, you've been a lot of places.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.006
Yeah, my...

27:57.080 --> 27:59.731
My dad likes to move
around a lot.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.887
What's your dad do?

28:04.080 --> 28:05.570
Boring stuff.

28:05.720 --> 28:06.881
Do you like it?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.928
No, not really.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.647
But my dad expects me
to follow in his footsteps, so,

28:14.720 --> 28:17.166
I've kind of gotten used to it.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.651
Yeah, I get it.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.290
My pops wants me
to take over the diner,

28:20.320 --> 28:22.004
but that's not happening.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.247
So...

28:25.320 --> 28:26.560
What do you really want to do?

28:29.120 --> 28:31.964
I want to be a photographer
and see the world.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.123
Go to strange lands,
eat crazy food.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.527
I want to be a rock star.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.965
But...

28:42.120 --> 28:44.088
I also really like cars.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.288
Being a mechanic seems rough.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.209
What?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.850
No, no, not at all.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.207
I mean, cars
are freakin' cool as hell.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.324
Fixing them is like a puzzle.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.251
And the best part is,
when you're done,

28:59.400 --> 29:02.290
they leave and you're not
responsible for them anymore.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.080
Have you kissed many girls?

29:13.760 --> 29:15.364
What?

29:16.360 --> 29:17.521
Yeah, of course.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.250
Like, lots.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.681
Really?

29:24.320 --> 29:27.210
Well, I guess we'll just
have to keep practicing.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.524
Oh, hey.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.727
What happened to you
at the diner?

29:41.840 --> 29:42.921
I turned around
to take your order

29:43.000 --> 29:44.445
and you were just gone.

29:44.640 --> 29:45.971
Long story.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.565
Have you seen Timmy?

29:47.680 --> 29:49.011
No, not yet, but he should
be here any minute

29:49.012 --> 29:50.411
for his guitar lesson.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.324
Yeah, we're gonna cancel that.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.561
What?

29:53.840 --> 29:54.762
We got to get out of here, okay?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.080
I don't have time to explain,
you just got to trust me.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.006
Trust you?

30:03.640 --> 30:05.404
And why would I do that again?

30:06.720 --> 30:08.722
You do remember me!

30:08.920 --> 30:10.001
How could I forget?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.685
What's wrong?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.689
I just hope this lasts.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.326
I'm not going anywhere, Robin.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.010
Yeah, says you.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.321
Well, I can't.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.562
Who else would take you
to the school dance?

30:41.440 --> 30:42.521
Is this your way of asking me

30:42.600 --> 30:44.841
to be your date,
Dean Winchester?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.121
Yeah.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.607
How am I doing so far?

30:51.960 --> 30:52.927
There were...

30:52.960 --> 30:54.246
There were reasons
why I had to leave.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.611
I don't have time to explain
them to you right now,

30:55.720 --> 30:56.880
I got to get you out of here.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.487
Hey!
What are you doing?

31:01.040 --> 31:02.166
I'm sorry.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.485
Sorry about what, Timmy?

31:07.560 --> 31:08.971
I can't stop it.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.606
Go, go, go!

31:17.520 --> 31:19.124
Sam, go!

31:20.320 --> 31:21.845
- It's locked.
- Damn it!

31:26.520 --> 31:27.567
Circle!

31:28.840 --> 31:30.171
Dean, what...

31:30.440 --> 31:31.771
- What just happened in there?
- Okay, listen to me.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.890
Whatever happens,
you stay inside this circle.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.451
- Understood?
- All right.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.560
Dean.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.641
I can't control her.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.800
Can't control who?

31:47.440 --> 31:49.249
Your mom, right?

31:51.480 --> 31:53.050
Timmy, listen...

31:54.920 --> 31:57.207
We need you to tell us
about the fire, okay?

32:01.720 --> 32:03.802
It was late
and we were driving home

32:03.840 --> 32:05.683
when we crashed in the woods.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.683
Everything was on fire.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.365
But...

32:10.480 --> 32:11.891
she saved me.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.007
Go!

32:13.040 --> 32:14.371
Pushed me out...

32:16.960 --> 32:18.080
...before the car blew up...

32:19.480 --> 32:20.766
...with her in it.

32:22.560 --> 32:24.927
But that's not all,
was it?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.765
I ran through the woods

32:28.000 --> 32:30.401
and found an empty building
where I hid.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.521
I was scared.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.881
It was dark and cold.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.089
So, I cried
and cried for my mom.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.768
And then, she came.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.889
But she had changed, right?

32:50.400 --> 32:53.529
I'll bet she gave you
that cool action figure, huh?

32:53.720 --> 32:56.200
Yeah, when I turned nine.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.084
Timmy...

33:01.240 --> 33:02.651
I'm gonna need
that action figure.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
No!

33:22.600 --> 33:25.649
/ clobber evil!

33:37.560 --> 33:38.721
I would say
it wasn't the action figure

33:38.840 --> 33:40.046
that was anchoring
her here, Dean.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
Then what is?

33:47.040 --> 33:48.040
Him.

33:55.960 --> 33:56.961
You know what?

33:58.520 --> 33:59.806
I think maybe his mom
can't let go

33:59.840 --> 34:01.683
and she's still protecting him
from the grave.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.808
Protecting him from what?
What, from us?

34:03.920 --> 34:05.251
Maybe she doesn't know
what threats are real

34:05.400 --> 34:07.280
and what's not,
so she just attacks all of them.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.924
Great, so what,
unless we waste the kid,

34:09.040 --> 34:10.326
we're sitting ducks?

34:11.280 --> 34:12.690
This is crazy!

34:12.800 --> 34:14.882
Robin. Robin!

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Damn it.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.649
Robin! Wait!

34:19.719 --> 34:20.719
Who are you?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.920
Right now, I'm the only thing
that's keeping you safe.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.928
Timmy, we're going to
need your help, okay?

34:41.639 --> 34:45.121
Listen to me.
I need you to focus, okay?

34:46.440 --> 34:47.929
We are not here to hurt you.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.166
Sammy!

35:00.320 --> 35:01.481
I can't stop her.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.602
Timmy, you have to try.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.925
She came to you
when you cried out for her.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.930
Now you have to tell her
to stop and go away!

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
But she's my mom!

35:12.080 --> 35:14.447
She's a ghost, Timmy.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.211
And because she can't move on,
she's going crazy, okay?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.971
You got to let her go.
You'll be okay.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.451
Listen to me.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.129
Sometimes you got to do
what's best for you,

35:27.240 --> 35:29.004
even if it's going to
hurt the ones you love.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.249
Mommy.
Stop it.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.885
Timmy, kung fu grip!

35:47.960 --> 35:50.440
Mommy, stop it!
Stop hurting people!

36:01.920 --> 36:03.410
You have to go...

36:04.400 --> 36:05.606
...never come back.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.882
I'll be okay, I promise.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.924
I love you, too.

37:04.480 --> 37:07.450
So, this is the family business?

37:07.680 --> 37:09.648
Told you it was boring.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.251
Yeah, right.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.240
Well, as you can see,

37:13.280 --> 37:15.442
I did not run off
to become a rock star.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.080
Hmm. I don't know about that.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.367
You look pretty rockin' to me,
Dean Winchester.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.131
And what about you?

37:24.160 --> 37:25.321
I mean, I always thought
that I would hate being

37:25.360 --> 37:27.681
in the same little town
my whole life.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.841
And, you know,
taking over the diner,

37:28.880 --> 37:30.325
like Dad always wanted.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.761
But I don't.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.080
You know, I just... I love it.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.211
Well, I guess
we didn't know everything

37:37.400 --> 37:39.482
we thought we did at 16, huh?

37:39.640 --> 37:40.640
Not everything.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.006
Just some things.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.451
Sounds like Timmy's gonna
need some help adjusting.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.125
Yeah, but he's got you.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.527
Always hate to see you go,
D-Dawg.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.843
Can't thank you enough
for this one, man.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.251
Sonny, we'll see you around.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.169
You can bet on that, boys.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.566
Take it easy, man.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.249
Hey, how... How'd you know
Timmy asking his mom

38:28.320 --> 38:30.527
to leave was gonna work?

38:30.720 --> 38:33.803
I didn't. Total Hail Mary.
Got lucky.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.725
You just got lucky?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.405
Kind of like
you did with this place.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.881
I mean, here I was,

38:41.920 --> 38:43.285
thinking this was
the worst part of your life

38:43.360 --> 38:45.169
and it turns out,
it was the best.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.041
Why'd you ever leave?

38:50.240 --> 38:52.288
Never felt right.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.640
Really?

38:53.800 --> 38:55.962
It was two months, Sam, okay?

38:56.040 --> 38:58.168
I couldn't wait to get out of here.
I don't know what to tell you.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.726
It wasn't me.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.205
Look at you.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.089
- You clean up good!
- Thank you.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.044
You know,
I've never actually been

39:30.120 --> 39:31.804
to one of these
school dances before.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.124
Yeah.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.926
Look, about that, Dean,
your old man's outside.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.450
And man, he's really something.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.088
I tried to tell him what
a big night it was for you, Dean,

39:46.200 --> 39:47.645
and asked him if he could
come back later,

39:47.720 --> 39:49.449
but he just said
to tell you he had a job.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.330
Said you'd know what that means.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.086
You know,
after I got out of jail,

40:06.160 --> 40:09.528
this place gave me
a second chance.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.529
And it's done
the same for you, too.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.691
So, if you want,

40:14.880 --> 40:17.326
I'll stick my neck out for you
and I'll fight for you to stay.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.361
Sonny...

40:54.720 --> 40:55.720
...thank you.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.766
For everything.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.366
But I have to go.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.521
Dean...

41:15.520 --> 41:16.726
Thank you.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.641
For what?

41:21.240 --> 41:23.925
For always being there.
For having my back.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.286
Look, I know
it always hasn't been easy.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.608
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.
