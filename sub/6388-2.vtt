00:00.120 --> 00:01.988
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.021 --> 00:04.257
Now, how many of those pills
did you take? How many?

00:04.291 --> 00:06.092
- No more than you did.
- What did you do?

00:06.126 --> 00:07.793
Only what you made me.

00:07.828 --> 00:10.229
Am I gonna be okay?

00:10.264 --> 00:12.598
The doctors, they think
you're gonna be fine.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.934
- What about her?
- You gotta get past this.

00:14.968 --> 00:16.469
You gotta forgive yourself.

00:16.503 --> 00:18.237
She was fuckin' looney tunes.

00:18.272 --> 00:19.805
She tried to kill you, Hank.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.274
You have a little flotsam
and jetsam there.

00:21.308 --> 00:23.276
You just blew him again, didn't you?

00:23.310 --> 00:26.512
God damn it, Stu.
I know about the blowing!

00:26.546 --> 00:28.781
It was two, actually.
It was two.

00:28.815 --> 00:32.518
And you're gonna be hearing
from my attorney, motherfucker.

00:32.552 --> 00:33.886
I want you to meet Gabriel.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.121
Oh, nice to meet you, Gabe.

00:35.155 --> 00:36.622
What the fuck?

00:36.657 --> 00:37.890
Sorry, Hank.

00:37.924 --> 00:39.025
You weren't supposed to see that.

00:39.059 --> 00:40.259
I'm dropping out of school.

00:40.294 --> 00:41.761
I want to be a writer.

00:41.795 --> 00:43.396
You gotta get your ass to rehab.

00:43.430 --> 00:45.931
Get your head out of your ass
and stop drinking.

00:45.966 --> 00:49.168
Sooner or later, you're just
gonna kill yourself.

00:49.202 --> 00:50.936
Oh, shit.

00:50.971 --> 00:52.738
This better not be an intervention.

00:52.773 --> 00:54.807
Hey! It's time for group.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.591
Ha! This place
is inspiring, Hank.

01:12.626 --> 01:15.795
Really, totally worth
the 60 large, if you ask me.

01:15.829 --> 01:18.297
Say, do they let you masturbate here?

01:18.332 --> 01:19.699
I'm just curious, 'cause it'd be cool

01:19.733 --> 01:22.201
to blow a big, salty one
right in old salty out the.

01:22.235 --> 01:24.737
Don't you think?

01:24.771 --> 01:27.707
Now, there is the surly,
mean-spirited bastard

01:27.741 --> 01:28.841
that I know and love.

01:28.875 --> 01:30.876
He's baaack.

01:30.911 --> 01:32.311
Do I feel better?
Yes.

01:32.346 --> 01:34.880
Do I see the wisdom
in a time out or a tune up?

01:34.915 --> 01:36.215
- Sure.
- Good.

01:36.249 --> 01:38.617
And I'm doing my best just
to keep an open mind

01:38.652 --> 01:40.920
- about all this Kumbaya shit.
- That's good.

01:40.954 --> 01:42.988
But some of the clientele, Charlie...

01:43.023 --> 01:45.324
Oh-ho-ho.

01:52.566 --> 01:54.100
What's this?

01:54.134 --> 01:55.568
It's a dime bag
of daddy's little helper.

01:55.602 --> 01:56.969
It's gonna help take the edge off, Hank.

01:57.003 --> 01:58.471
How did you get this in here?

01:58.505 --> 02:00.639
My butt cheeks.

02:00.674 --> 02:03.075
Feels good
to finally unclench. Ahh.

02:03.110 --> 02:04.410
I'm disgusted...

02:04.444 --> 02:06.679
yet delighted.
Thank you.

02:06.713 --> 02:09.582
But aren't you supposed
to be supporting my sobriety?

02:09.616 --> 02:11.417
Come on, weed don't count.

02:11.451 --> 02:14.153
Oh, these queerios in here
would beg to differ.

02:14.187 --> 02:16.389
20 years ago, people partied too much.

02:16.423 --> 02:17.990
Nowadays, everybody's an addict.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.459
I mean, I know I'm a big fan
of the bye-bye-pain juice,

02:20.494 --> 02:23.562
but I don't think I'm an
alcoholic, do you?

02:23.597 --> 02:25.064
Charlie?

02:25.098 --> 02:26.465
Charlie, you listening to me?

02:26.500 --> 02:27.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm with you.

02:27.734 --> 02:30.403
- Is that Robbie Mac?
- Who?

02:30.437 --> 02:32.471
- The actor.
- I don't know.

02:32.506 --> 02:34.507
I'm hearing he wants to leave CAA.

02:34.541 --> 02:36.041
You hold that thought.
I'm gonna go say hello.

02:36.076 --> 02:37.910
Dude, I was just rolling
in the deep with you.

02:37.944 --> 02:39.979
Awesome, awesome, and I
totally want to hear about it.

02:40.013 --> 02:41.814
Just give me five minutes, will you?

02:41.848 --> 02:43.048
Ow.

03:14.317 --> 03:22.317
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:30.730 --> 03:32.931
Being a child star really
fucked me up something fierce,

03:32.933 --> 03:34.266
I'll tell you that.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.135
I mean, at the beginning,
you know, it was so much fun.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.603
I mean, it was, uh...

03:37.637 --> 03:39.271
all the M&Ms you could possibly
want from craft service

03:39.306 --> 03:41.540
and all the suction you could
stand from the extras.

03:41.575 --> 03:43.876
But by the time that I left
<i>The Wonder Years,</i>

03:43.910 --> 03:45.744
I was, uh...

03:45.779 --> 03:49.615
I was shooting narcotics into my taint,

03:49.649 --> 03:51.650
and, uh, letting some very
questionable dudes

03:51.685 --> 03:54.553
blow me for drug money.

03:54.588 --> 03:57.423
Sometimes simultaneously.

03:57.457 --> 03:58.977
Ah, hey, you know, that's okay, dude.

03:58.992 --> 04:01.260
As my good friend and agent
is fond of saying,

04:01.294 --> 04:03.028
"Holes is holes," you know?

04:05.465 --> 04:08.167
What about you, Hank?
How are you feeling?

04:08.201 --> 04:09.969
Well, since you asked,

04:10.003 --> 04:11.971
I feel like the good lord himself

04:12.005 --> 04:13.772
picked me up in his bare hands,

04:13.807 --> 04:16.375
laid me down on a bed of rusty nails,

04:16.409 --> 04:17.776
pinned my ankles behind my ears,

04:17.810 --> 04:18.978
and just stuck it in.

04:19.012 --> 04:20.745
No vaseline, no lube, no nothing.

04:20.779 --> 04:22.081
Not even a little spittle.

04:22.115 --> 04:24.383
That motherfucker just took
his Darth Vader helmet,

04:24.417 --> 04:27.353
that big Darth Vader helmet
and just rammed it home.

04:27.387 --> 04:29.588
And he wrecked my pretty
little virgin asshole.

04:29.623 --> 04:31.590
My sweet little brown bud.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.193
Pulled out, came on my tits,
wiped his dick on the curtains,

04:34.227 --> 04:37.196
and left me for dead.

04:37.230 --> 04:38.297
That's just me.

04:38.331 --> 04:40.165
How 'bout you guys?
How do you feel?

04:40.200 --> 04:43.502
Is anybody else sitting
in a puddle right now?

04:43.537 --> 04:45.204
Splash! Ha ha!

04:45.238 --> 04:47.706
Come on, Hank, let's--
let's get serious, okay?

04:47.741 --> 04:50.743
Let's put on our big boy pants
and do some work.

04:50.777 --> 04:51.977
All right?
Give it a try.

04:52.012 --> 04:53.579
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:53.613 --> 04:56.048
My name is Hank.

04:56.082 --> 04:57.516
And, uh...

05:01.021 --> 05:02.821
- And...
- And...

05:02.856 --> 05:04.156
I'm an alcoholic.

05:04.190 --> 05:05.824
- You are?
- You are.

05:05.859 --> 05:08.193
Hey, now you're just slapping
labels on me, brother,

05:08.228 --> 05:09.261
and I don't appreciate that.

05:09.296 --> 05:11.063
Okay, Hank, addiction is defined

05:11.097 --> 05:12.565
as continuing to do something

05:12.599 --> 05:13.832
in the face of mounting consequence.

05:13.867 --> 05:14.907
Okay, I'm with you so far.

05:14.935 --> 05:16.302
Now take me somewhere with this.

05:16.336 --> 05:17.803
Okay, so how would you label yourself?

05:17.837 --> 05:20.839
I guess I see myself as an enthusiast.

05:20.874 --> 05:23.342
A drug and alcohol enthusiast.

05:23.376 --> 05:26.145
Hank, you're here because
you abused alcohol

05:26.179 --> 05:27.913
to such an extent
that your friends and family

05:27.948 --> 05:29.448
had to stage an intervention.

05:29.482 --> 05:31.417
That's true, but they're
a little screwy themselves.

05:31.451 --> 05:33.385
Really?
Well, your friend Charlie

05:33.420 --> 05:35.287
said that you drank your own urine.

05:35.322 --> 05:36.889
That--that is also true.

05:36.923 --> 05:39.024
But that was an honest mistake,

05:39.059 --> 05:40.559
and not as unpleasant as it sounds,

05:40.594 --> 05:41.961
which is good to know,

05:41.995 --> 05:44.530
in case you're ever in
a life and death situation.

05:44.564 --> 05:46.398
You're welcome.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.113
And you were distraught
over a former lover

05:48.134 --> 05:50.569
who killed herself and tried
to kill you in the process.

05:50.604 --> 05:52.938
Yeah. Well, it sounds
kind of soapy

05:52.973 --> 05:55.207
when you put it like that,
but who wouldn't be?

05:55.241 --> 05:57.242
I mean, isn't it normal
to want to numb yourself

05:57.277 --> 05:58.677
when you're in pain?

05:58.712 --> 06:01.280
Would a doctor operate
without anesthesia?

06:01.314 --> 06:02.815
Nailed it.

06:02.849 --> 06:05.851
Hank, this is not
an intellectual process.

06:05.885 --> 06:07.419
This is not a polemic.
Okay?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.822
This is about letting go
and letting God.

06:09.856 --> 06:11.490
Oh, yeah, well, that's what Batesy did.

06:11.524 --> 06:14.860
He let go, let God, and he let
you take him in your mouth.

06:14.894 --> 06:16.862
Boom.

06:16.896 --> 06:18.631
Thank you for
bringing this up, actually.

06:18.665 --> 06:21.066
Hank is referencing
an indiscretion of mine.

06:21.101 --> 06:24.536
And, uh, it was
completely unprofessional.

06:24.571 --> 06:26.839
Uh, and it led to a five-week
intense relationship.

06:26.873 --> 06:28.140
I have no regrets.

06:28.174 --> 06:30.309
I learned a lot about myself
during that time.

06:30.343 --> 06:32.144
- Ooh, I bet you did.
- I explored my humanity.

06:32.178 --> 06:33.545
And your flexibility.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.614
And I learned that I am
capable of error.

06:35.649 --> 06:37.783
But also capable of great passion.

06:37.817 --> 06:40.252
Richard Bates will always be
my favorite mistake.

06:40.286 --> 06:42.087
Ugh.

06:44.924 --> 06:48.260
Forgive me for asking,
but why are you here?

06:48.294 --> 06:50.029
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

06:50.063 --> 06:51.530
Why are you wasting all of our time?

06:51.564 --> 06:54.266
Who are you, and why are you
being so aggressive with me?

06:54.300 --> 06:56.201
This is faith.
She's our new friend.

06:56.236 --> 06:57.970
- You missed her introduction.
- Because you were late.

06:58.004 --> 06:59.605
And I'm being so "aggressive" with you

06:59.639 --> 07:02.107
because everyone sitting here
is in real pain.

07:02.142 --> 07:04.643
You're just doing
lame stand-up over there.

07:04.678 --> 07:07.146
Hmm.
Maybe that's my process.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.415
Well, maybe you're just an asshole.

07:09.449 --> 07:10.916
No, I am definitely an asshole.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.284
There's no doubt about that.

07:12.318 --> 07:13.552
Hey, she's judging me.

07:13.586 --> 07:16.321
How come you're not coming down on her?

07:16.356 --> 07:21.627
We do not judge those who judge.

07:21.661 --> 07:23.429
Well, I think that's all for now.

07:23.463 --> 07:26.298
Why don't we stand up,
and everybody hold hands.

07:32.672 --> 07:34.006
God give us the serenity--

07:34.040 --> 07:35.974
No, no, no, take his hand
out of your pants.

07:36.009 --> 07:38.310
Take his hand out of your pants.

07:38.344 --> 07:41.447
Robbie, what is it you're looking for

07:41.481 --> 07:43.549
in a representative?

07:43.583 --> 07:44.883
It's quite simple, really.

07:44.918 --> 07:48.420
I'm looking for a man
who's an honest animal.

07:48.455 --> 07:51.990
I'm looking for a man who's an advocate

07:52.025 --> 07:53.325
for me and my career.

07:53.359 --> 07:56.662
And I want a man who's openly gay.

07:56.696 --> 07:59.431
Oh... I see.

07:59.466 --> 08:01.467
I want an agent who understands

08:01.501 --> 08:04.136
what I'm going through,
both as an artist

08:04.170 --> 08:07.005
and as a gay man.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.507
I want a "gaygent."

08:08.541 --> 08:10.109
Well...

08:10.143 --> 08:13.545
That's--that's interesting.

08:13.580 --> 08:17.049
- Because...
- You're gay?

08:17.083 --> 08:19.118
I'm gay?

08:19.152 --> 08:21.286
Is that a question or a statement?

08:21.321 --> 08:23.789
Exactly.

08:23.823 --> 08:26.325
I don't understand.

08:26.359 --> 08:28.227
Well, then, let me clear it up

08:28.261 --> 08:29.995
for you, Robbie.

08:30.029 --> 08:32.097
If you sign with me,

08:32.131 --> 08:36.802
if you put your career
into my smooth, elegant hands,

08:36.836 --> 08:40.005
you could sleep easy, like a baby,

08:40.039 --> 08:43.308
content in the knowledge
that your representative

08:43.342 --> 08:48.413
understands you
from every conceivable angle.

08:48.448 --> 08:49.782
Because...

08:49.816 --> 08:54.853
Because...

08:54.888 --> 08:56.488
I'm...

09:00.059 --> 09:03.028
gay?

09:10.436 --> 09:11.670
I knew it.

09:11.704 --> 09:12.704
You did?

09:12.739 --> 09:15.374
Mm!
Yeah.

09:15.408 --> 09:16.809
I mean, I had a strong feeling.

09:16.843 --> 09:18.443
What, a <i>strong</i> feeling?

09:18.478 --> 09:20.512
Really? Why?
I'm just curious.

09:20.547 --> 09:24.750
You're very sensitive and kind,

09:24.784 --> 09:27.286
yet incredibly carnal.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.721
And you're wearing pink.

09:29.756 --> 09:33.225
My gaydar is pinging, bro.

09:34.861 --> 09:38.564
I have a really good feeling
about this, Charlie.

09:55.849 --> 09:57.449
Fucking men!

09:57.483 --> 09:59.651
You know, I'm quitting men.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.887
I'm fucking quitting men.
Are you with me?

10:01.921 --> 10:03.422
I'm with you.
I'm with you,

10:03.456 --> 10:04.556
- whether I like it or not.
- Mm.

10:04.591 --> 10:06.525
'Cause it is gonna be a long time

10:06.559 --> 10:10.662
before I trust myself around
the male of the species.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.897
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause I--

10:11.931 --> 10:13.265
I don't know what it is.

10:13.299 --> 10:16.735
I just kind of turn them into...

10:16.769 --> 10:18.737
Wild animals.

10:18.771 --> 10:20.072
- Oh, dude.
- Yeah.

10:20.106 --> 10:21.707
I mean, I know what you mean.

10:21.741 --> 10:24.643
But you're missing
the whole point of the thing.

10:24.677 --> 10:26.144
They're born animals.

10:26.179 --> 10:28.080
We just--
we fool ourselves

10:28.114 --> 10:30.282
into thinking we can make into these

10:30.316 --> 10:32.017
sensitive little pussy eaters

10:32.051 --> 10:34.620
we could sit and watch
<i>The Bachelor</i> with.

10:34.654 --> 10:36.455
Fuck.

10:36.489 --> 10:38.724
- It's my phone.
- What's wrong?

10:38.758 --> 10:41.293
- What?
- Oh, my God.

10:41.327 --> 10:43.428
- What?
- It's--it--I-I-I--

10:43.463 --> 10:44.496
it--it's that--

10:44.530 --> 10:46.265
I sent my resume for a job.

10:46.299 --> 10:47.499
- Don't answer it.
- It's for the--

10:47.533 --> 10:48.567
- Don't answer it.
- No, this is the--

10:48.601 --> 10:49.935
They might want
to interview--

10:49.969 --> 10:51.270
Dude, you're baked.

10:51.304 --> 10:53.705
You're gonna say something
stupid and jacked up...

10:53.740 --> 10:55.941
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- Like you fuckin' are doing.

10:55.975 --> 10:57.576
Mm-mmm.
Don't answer it.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.578
- I'm gonna answer it.
- No--fuck.

10:59.612 --> 11:01.413
- If you do, keep it down.
- I'm gonna answer it.

11:01.447 --> 11:04.116
I don't want Stuart to wake up
and get a contact high.

11:04.150 --> 11:06.018
- Good morning.
- Oh, shit.

11:06.052 --> 11:08.520
I'm sorry?

11:08.554 --> 11:10.656
You're so crazy.

11:10.690 --> 11:12.391
Hello.

11:12.425 --> 11:13.926
Oh, really?

11:15.628 --> 11:16.962
You do?

11:16.996 --> 11:18.330
They want to interview me.

11:18.364 --> 11:19.631
- Why?
- Well, yeah.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.033
I would love to come in
for an interview.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.034
Oh...

11:22.068 --> 11:23.368
Uh-huh.

11:23.403 --> 11:24.569
Half an hour?

11:24.604 --> 11:26.438
Yeah, I could get there in half an hour.

11:44.824 --> 11:48.760
Hey.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.929
Hey.

11:50.964 --> 11:52.130
Yeah?

11:52.165 --> 11:54.700
Just sayin' hey.

11:54.734 --> 11:58.637
Hey.

11:58.671 --> 12:00.272
- We done?
- No.

12:00.306 --> 12:02.341
I wanted to apologize
for being such a turd

12:02.375 --> 12:03.942
in the punch bowl this morning.

12:03.977 --> 12:06.278
At least, I think it was me.
I mean, could have been you.

12:06.312 --> 12:07.379
Women's issues.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.448
Hormonal fluctuations and whatnot.

12:09.482 --> 12:13.085
Is it--sorry,
was this an apology or--

12:13.119 --> 12:14.219
Okay, it was me.

12:14.253 --> 12:16.254
Yeah. Hank.

12:16.289 --> 12:18.590
- Faith.
- Nice to meet you, Faith.

12:18.624 --> 12:20.859
What are you in for?

12:20.893 --> 12:22.794
Well...

12:22.829 --> 12:24.663
it's a little personal, don't you think?

12:24.697 --> 12:27.399
Okay, well, then I will back up

12:27.433 --> 12:29.401
and make with the polite conversation.

12:29.435 --> 12:34.573
Um, what do you do in the real world?

12:34.607 --> 12:37.843
My relationship to the real world

12:37.877 --> 12:39.378
would be tenuous, at best.

12:39.412 --> 12:40.579
I hear that.

12:40.613 --> 12:41.847
But, if you must know,

12:41.881 --> 12:43.682
I traverse the globe.

12:43.716 --> 12:45.384
In the company of musicians.

12:46.886 --> 12:48.587
You're a groupie.

12:48.621 --> 12:49.654
I prefer muse.

12:49.689 --> 12:50.856
Sure, who wouldn't?

12:50.890 --> 12:52.657
That's nice work, if you can get it.

12:54.694 --> 12:57.996
"Muse" would really be more applicable,

12:58.031 --> 13:00.599
since men have written songs about me.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.634
Well, I can see why.

13:02.668 --> 13:05.037
Hank, you're not my type.

13:05.071 --> 13:06.671
I wasn't trying to be.

13:06.706 --> 13:08.673
Right, 'cause I'm not
the least bit fuckable.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.275
I didn't say that.

13:10.309 --> 13:13.278
They kind of frown
on that sort of thing here.

13:13.312 --> 13:15.414
Not that it matters.

13:15.448 --> 13:21.420
Because I only fall
for extraordinary men.

13:21.454 --> 13:23.121
Oh... okay.

13:23.156 --> 13:26.458
Would you say
you're... extraordinary?

13:26.492 --> 13:28.293
Fuck if I know, dude.

13:30.296 --> 13:32.464
Congrats--I think
that's probably

13:32.498 --> 13:36.034
the first really honest thing
I've heard you say.

13:36.069 --> 13:39.171
So... anything else
you'd care to discuss?

13:39.205 --> 13:42.107
No, that--
that about covers it.

13:42.141 --> 13:44.142
All righty, then.

13:44.177 --> 13:46.745
All right.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.016
Oh...

13:51.050 --> 13:53.051
There she is--
Rebecca Moody!

13:53.086 --> 13:55.654
Rebecca Moody!

13:59.325 --> 14:02.360
Marcy?

14:02.395 --> 14:03.962
Please, I beg of you.

14:03.996 --> 14:06.865
Just a few moments of your time.

14:06.899 --> 14:09.034
- P-pl--
- Sit and spin, Stu.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.235
Sit and spin.

14:10.269 --> 14:12.070
My heart aches for you, lover.

14:12.105 --> 14:13.872
For--former.

14:13.906 --> 14:15.674
Former lover.

14:15.708 --> 14:18.477
Here, brought you cash.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.048
No, just walking around money.
No strings attached.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.519
This is disg--
You think you can bribe me?

14:27.553 --> 14:29.387
It's not a bribe when it's love.

14:29.422 --> 14:31.923
It's not love when you're
getting your hog polished

14:31.958 --> 14:33.959
by slutty starlets.

14:33.993 --> 14:36.461
Marcy, it was just
the twice with the one.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.631
Fuck you, Stu.

14:39.665 --> 14:42.667
Okay. Fuck me.

14:42.702 --> 14:45.370
Wait, wait...
I forgot.

14:45.404 --> 14:47.906
Brought you some of this.

14:47.940 --> 14:50.876
Figured you might be running low.

14:56.349 --> 14:57.649
Hoo!

15:02.955 --> 15:04.856
I miss making love with you, Marcy.

15:04.891 --> 15:06.424
Ohh.

15:06.459 --> 15:09.261
I miss my sexy wittle wubber fucky.

15:09.295 --> 15:11.363
What about Lizzie?

15:11.397 --> 15:13.832
Oh, please!

15:13.866 --> 15:15.267
She was done with me

15:15.301 --> 15:17.636
the second that we wrapped
<i>Santa Monica Cop.</i>

15:17.670 --> 15:19.404
So you know what I did?

15:19.438 --> 15:21.940
I cut her right the fuck
out of the picture.

15:21.974 --> 15:24.409
And she gave lousy blowies.

15:24.443 --> 15:28.013
I mean, arrogant, lazy, toothy.

15:28.047 --> 15:29.681
- Ouch.
- Ouchy.

15:29.715 --> 15:31.383
- No.
- Mm-mmm.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.018
Not fun.
Not fun.

15:33.052 --> 15:35.120
Hello.
Wait, wait, wait--whoa.

15:35.154 --> 15:36.888
What do we see here?

15:36.923 --> 15:38.089
- Oh, my goodness.
- Mm-mmm.

15:38.124 --> 15:39.157
- Oh, no!
- No!

15:39.192 --> 15:41.326
It appears--
it appears that mommy...

15:41.360 --> 15:42.961
- I just found that.
- Is a little horn-ay!

15:42.995 --> 15:44.696
- I was vacuuming! Shut up!
- I know where you found it.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.232
- I just found that.
- I found it too!

15:47.266 --> 15:49.334
- Don't.
- You know...

15:49.368 --> 15:51.436
I have a wonderful idea.

15:51.470 --> 15:53.405
Don't. No.
No, you don't.

15:53.439 --> 15:56.274
Allow me to work on this
with you, Marcy.

15:56.309 --> 15:57.776
Let me taste you again.

15:57.810 --> 16:00.612
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, please.

16:00.646 --> 16:02.013
Please.

16:02.048 --> 16:06.384
Let me just lick
all of your troubles away.

16:07.486 --> 16:09.754
- Oh, Jesus.
- No. No, no.

16:09.789 --> 16:14.092
I'll give you one of daddy's
long, slow tongue baths.

16:14.126 --> 16:15.994
- Oh, my God.
- Ah-blah-blah-blah.

16:16.028 --> 16:17.329
Oh, God.

16:17.363 --> 16:19.364
My snorkel.

16:19.398 --> 16:21.433
Oh, God.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.001
Oh, Jesus.

16:23.035 --> 16:24.836
That's what I'm sayin' right now.

16:24.870 --> 16:25.937
Okay.

16:25.972 --> 16:28.106
Take off your glasses.

16:31.911 --> 16:34.012
- What's with the muscle?
- Oh, him.

16:34.046 --> 16:36.348
- He gave me a ride.
- Why?

16:36.382 --> 16:37.849
Because I spent the night at his place.

16:37.883 --> 16:39.284
Oh... okay.

16:39.318 --> 16:41.386
Well, that's not the least
bit disgusting.

16:41.420 --> 16:42.487
Not to mention dangerous.

16:42.521 --> 16:43.622
How do you know he's not
a serial killer?

16:43.656 --> 16:44.756
Look at him.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.092
You should trust my judgment.

16:47.126 --> 16:48.393
I should? Why?
You have--

16:48.427 --> 16:50.895
you have terrible taste
in the opposite sex.

16:50.930 --> 16:53.265
Good visit, dad.
I should get going.

16:53.299 --> 16:56.101
You sit and you stay.

16:56.135 --> 16:59.404
Mm, what's his name?

16:59.438 --> 17:02.073
You don't know.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.442
Jane, you ignorant slut.

17:04.477 --> 17:06.377
That's why I didn't introduce you.

17:06.412 --> 17:07.545
I wasn't being rude,

17:07.579 --> 17:09.513
I just didn't retain the information.

17:09.548 --> 17:11.449
I'm appalled.

17:11.483 --> 17:13.617
And I'm changing the subject.

17:13.653 --> 17:15.753
- Ah.
- How are you?

17:15.788 --> 17:17.821
Seven different kinds of shitty.

17:17.857 --> 17:19.337
Trying to get it down to two or three.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.292
You know, fighting the good fight.

17:21.327 --> 17:22.460
Trying to make you proud of me,

17:22.494 --> 17:24.128
or at least a little less ashamed.

17:24.163 --> 17:25.329
How's school?

17:25.364 --> 17:27.098
Dad, I told you I'm not going.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.633
Working on a novel.

17:28.668 --> 17:30.335
A novel, what--

17:30.369 --> 17:31.936
what are you gonna fill a novel with?

17:31.971 --> 17:34.372
Life. Love. Sex.

17:34.407 --> 17:36.608
Death.
What else?

17:36.642 --> 17:38.322
What do you know about
any of those things?

17:38.344 --> 17:41.279
That's the point, dad.
I want the experience.

17:41.314 --> 17:42.447
I want to start living.

17:42.481 --> 17:45.116
No, living is highly overrated.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.919
Sir...

17:47.953 --> 17:49.521
Hey.

17:49.555 --> 17:51.156
Ross.

17:51.190 --> 17:52.257
Oh!

17:52.291 --> 17:54.059
It's nice to meet you.

17:54.093 --> 17:56.194
Roscoe.

17:56.228 --> 17:57.629
I just want to say

17:57.663 --> 18:00.131
I think that it's really cool
what you're doing here.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.533
Respect.

18:01.567 --> 18:02.934
I appreciate that.

18:02.968 --> 18:04.602
Been through it a few times
myself, actually.

18:04.637 --> 18:06.604
Yeah. Doesn't always take
the first time.

18:06.639 --> 18:07.605
You know?

18:07.640 --> 18:09.174
85% of first-time rehabbers

18:09.208 --> 18:10.842
eventually relapse.

18:10.876 --> 18:13.111
So go easy on yourself, okay?

18:13.145 --> 18:14.212
That's good to know.

18:14.246 --> 18:16.481
What's your poison?
The muffin?

18:16.515 --> 18:18.283
Oh, no.

18:18.317 --> 18:20.418
Heroin. Coke.
Booze, speed.

18:20.453 --> 18:22.020
A little bit of everything, really.

18:22.054 --> 18:23.755
And there's all the fucked-up
sexual shit

18:23.789 --> 18:25.790
that goes along with it.

18:36.836 --> 18:39.804
So that's the gist of it.

18:39.839 --> 18:41.806
Classy but decadent.

18:41.841 --> 18:44.042
Elegant yet understated.

18:44.076 --> 18:47.345
And 100% environmentally correct.

18:50.282 --> 18:53.084
- Karen?
- Mm.

18:53.119 --> 18:54.919
I'm sorry.
I'm starving.

18:54.954 --> 18:57.389
Mmm! Mmm.

18:57.423 --> 18:59.391
Mm, who lives here?

18:59.425 --> 19:01.159
Uh, I do.

19:01.193 --> 19:02.761
- Oh.
- With my husband.

19:02.795 --> 19:04.996
- Mmm.
- He's a musician.

19:05.030 --> 19:08.533
Right. That--
that makes total sense.

19:08.567 --> 19:12.003
He's really, really concerned
about the environment.

19:14.907 --> 19:16.307
Groovy.

19:16.342 --> 19:18.443
Good for him.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.113
Are you high right now?

19:22.148 --> 19:23.948
No.

19:23.983 --> 19:24.949
No, I am not.

19:24.984 --> 19:26.618
I'm highly professional.

19:26.652 --> 19:30.488
Highly.

19:35.628 --> 19:38.029
I'm sorry.

19:38.063 --> 19:40.598
I am. I'm really
fucking high right now.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.867
I know.
But it's so bad.

19:42.902 --> 19:44.702
I was smoking pot when you called,

19:44.737 --> 19:46.704
but it was such
an incredible opportunity,

19:46.739 --> 19:48.373
I didn't want to miss out.
I'm sorry.

19:48.407 --> 19:50.875
I'm sorry.
It's so unprofessional.

19:50.910 --> 19:53.845
I'm sorry.

19:53.879 --> 19:56.080
When can you start?

19:56.115 --> 19:58.116
What?

19:58.150 --> 19:59.417
I have the job?

19:59.452 --> 20:00.819
I know you're stoned,

20:00.853 --> 20:02.587
but I'm not talking
fuckin' French, am I?

20:08.961 --> 20:10.562
Okay, you know your shit.

20:10.596 --> 20:11.996
- You like to party.
- Oh, yeah.

20:12.031 --> 20:13.998
You're gonna fit right in.

20:14.033 --> 20:15.400
Just one thing, and, uh,

20:15.434 --> 20:17.202
you and I will get along just fine.

20:17.236 --> 20:18.603
Okay. Yeah.

20:18.637 --> 20:21.105
Don't fuck my husband.

20:21.140 --> 20:25.243
Oh, God.
I'm not a husband fucker.

20:25.277 --> 20:28.213
What's this, mommy?

20:34.119 --> 20:36.254
Oh, my God!

20:36.288 --> 20:38.857
Worst mother ever!

20:38.891 --> 20:39.858
Ugh!

20:39.892 --> 20:41.226
- Stu!
- Stuart!

20:41.260 --> 20:43.194
My namesake!
Get over here, boy!

20:43.229 --> 20:44.529
Whoa! Help me!

20:44.563 --> 20:46.064
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

20:46.098 --> 20:47.866
Oh, God!

20:47.900 --> 20:49.834
You got me, I got you...

20:49.869 --> 20:51.269
Why didn't you say something?

20:51.303 --> 20:53.605
Hmm?
About what?

20:53.639 --> 20:55.640
Did you sign Robbie Mac?

20:55.674 --> 20:57.642
Oh, that.

20:57.676 --> 21:00.411
Yeah, I just... wasn't sure
if it was gonna stick.

21:00.446 --> 21:02.313
Well, it stuck, all right.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.617
It's on <i>Deadline.</i>

21:14.326 --> 21:16.661
So it is.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.429
Told ya!

21:18.464 --> 21:20.131
Good job, Runkle.

21:20.165 --> 21:22.834
Congrats.

21:22.868 --> 21:24.335
Thanks.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.371
I'm really happy for you, man.

21:26.405 --> 21:28.840
I know you've been struggling
with your sexuality now

21:28.874 --> 21:30.008
for years.

21:30.042 --> 21:31.175
It's gotta be liberating, right,

21:31.210 --> 21:33.077
outing yourself like this?

21:33.112 --> 21:35.880
And what a way to do it.

21:35.915 --> 21:37.582
Bravo, Runkle.

21:37.616 --> 21:38.883
Bravo.

21:38.918 --> 21:42.787
Wow, this is just out of control.

21:42.821 --> 21:44.722
It is.
And you know what?

21:44.757 --> 21:48.927
I think a whole new world's
about to open up for you.

21:48.961 --> 21:51.462
Welcome to the mafia, buddy.

22:30.002 --> 22:32.604
I'm sorry, Hank.

22:32.638 --> 22:35.306
You're absolutely right.

22:35.341 --> 22:38.009
I don't know anything about you.

22:49.088 --> 22:50.955
But I want to.

23:02.935 --> 23:04.636
Fuck!

23:04.670 --> 23:06.337
All this cunt is...

23:06.372 --> 23:09.007
- juice--uhh!
- What the fuck are you doing?

23:09.041 --> 23:10.975
What does it look like I'm doing?

23:11.010 --> 23:13.611
Feel that?
It's my kegels.

23:13.646 --> 23:15.546
That's fancy for pussy exercises.

23:15.581 --> 23:17.148
- I don't mean to be rude--
- Oh, that's right!

23:17.182 --> 23:19.183
Take that, mommy!

23:19.218 --> 23:21.285
Please get the fuck off me.
Please?

23:21.320 --> 23:23.554
You're getting soft.

23:23.589 --> 23:26.424
I can feel you getting soft already.

23:26.458 --> 23:30.662
Faggot!

23:30.696 --> 23:34.365
You tell anyone about this...
I'll kill you.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.566
Oh, no, don't worry.

23:35.601 --> 23:36.834
I'm not gonna tell anybody about this.

23:36.869 --> 23:40.938
Good.

23:40.973 --> 23:42.774
God, I want drugs!

23:42.808 --> 23:44.175
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

23:44.209 --> 23:45.443
Fuck you.

23:45.477 --> 23:46.844
Kill you!

24:16.442 --> 24:17.642
Don't worry.
Your prayers have been answered.

24:17.676 --> 24:19.477
I'm leaving.

24:22.214 --> 24:23.815
That's it?

24:23.849 --> 24:25.450
You're quitting?

24:25.484 --> 24:26.651
Just like that?

24:26.685 --> 24:28.319
Yeah.

24:28.353 --> 24:29.787
This shit ain't for me.

24:29.822 --> 24:33.191
- Don't let me stop you.
- I'm not.

24:33.225 --> 24:35.126
That girl...

24:35.160 --> 24:36.661
the one who came to visit.

24:36.695 --> 24:40.098
My daughter.

24:40.132 --> 24:41.572
Would you really want her to see you

24:41.600 --> 24:44.535
make a chump move like this?

24:44.570 --> 24:47.438
Besides, if you bail,

24:47.473 --> 24:52.243
you're never gonna find out
what the fuck I'm doing here.

25:08.193 --> 25:10.428
So...

25:10.462 --> 25:14.298
for the last six months,

25:14.333 --> 25:16.634
I've been on the road with...

25:16.668 --> 25:19.537
one of the biggest bands in the world.

25:19.571 --> 25:24.208
And sharing a bed with arguably

25:24.243 --> 25:30.214
the most gifted guitar player
in the known universe.

25:30.249 --> 25:33.818
And, uh...

25:33.852 --> 25:36.154
about 36 hours ago,

25:36.188 --> 25:39.924
I woke up in room 1009, Four Seasons,

25:39.958 --> 25:42.794
somewhere in the middle
of this fair country.

25:42.828 --> 25:46.731
But on this particular morning,
there was no waking him up.

25:46.765 --> 25:48.299
'Cause he was dead.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.934
Yeah, I-I heard about that.

25:49.968 --> 25:52.236
I'm sorry.

25:52.271 --> 25:54.639
No, but you're right.

25:54.673 --> 25:56.107
That guy was a fuckin' genius.

25:56.141 --> 25:58.209
Yeah, fuck.

25:58.243 --> 26:02.146
He really was.

26:02.181 --> 26:06.751
And married too,
which is why I had to go.

26:06.785 --> 26:08.119
He had a credit here.

26:08.153 --> 26:10.855
Tried to get clean a bunch of times.

26:10.889 --> 26:13.257
He said I could come here
and use the credit

26:13.292 --> 26:18.896
if I ever got strung out
from the road, you know?

26:18.931 --> 26:23.067
I figured this was...
as good a place

26:23.101 --> 26:25.236
to grieve him as any.

26:25.270 --> 26:26.971
Sounds like a solid plan.

26:27.005 --> 26:29.907
Maybe it's not such a bad idea
for you too, Hank.

26:32.511 --> 26:35.913
What's so bad about taking
a vacation from your life?

26:38.517 --> 26:39.684
Do you wanna get high?

26:39.718 --> 26:41.452
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

26:41.486 --> 26:43.154
I believe he does.

26:43.188 --> 26:46.324
Do you have anything to roll with?

26:46.358 --> 26:48.226
Ooh... um...

26:50.462 --> 26:53.064
They don't call it
the good book for nothin'.

26:53.098 --> 26:54.999
Oh...

26:55.033 --> 26:56.834
Old testament or new?

26:56.869 --> 26:59.036
I'm an old school kind of girl.

26:59.071 --> 27:00.438
I feel so bad.
