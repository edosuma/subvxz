11:44.578 --> 11:46.247
YOU MUST DO AS SHE ASKS.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.706

I'M HERE.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.085

11:51.168 --> 11:53.963
I WILL.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.549
I WILL.
JUST DON'T HURT HER, PLEASE.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.800
GRAN.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.678
PLEASE DON'T HURT HER.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.740

BETWEEN SNAKES AND LADDERS

12:21.824 --> 12:22.700
AND CHECKERS.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.118
- CHECK AND CHADDERS.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.995
CHECK ADDERS.
NO.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
SNECKERS.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.831

THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE BOARD

12:28.914 --> 12:31.584

FROM THIS LIFE TO THE AFTERLIFE.

KIND OF ONE-SIDED.

I'M STILL SEEING MICK.

LONG-DISTANCE THING A GO.
