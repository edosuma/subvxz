00:09.477 --> 00:10.344
JACKIE: Well, yeah.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.480
So this one's OK.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.614
No.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.049
You don't want to get a
used washer and dryer.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.350
I can't afford a new one.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.486
You're going to put
clothes that touch your body

00:18.519 --> 00:21.222
into somebody's filthy machine?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.990
I do it here all the time.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.829
Here but our filth is family.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.432
What's your problem?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.933
I just think if you
get a washer and dryer,

00:32.966 --> 00:35.203
you're not going to come
around here no more.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.305
I'm still going to come over.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.339
No, you won't.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.675
Nobody comes here
unless they have to.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.576
I got to eat.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.378
Don't I?
- Yeah.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.846
And you'll probably
learn how to cook.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.316
And then you'll start going
off to the supermarket

00:48.349 --> 00:50.118
with your fancy new
washer and dryer.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.051
OK, OK.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.220
I'll throw the paper away.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.156
You're in no condition
to discuss this now.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.057
Mom, can I have the
car on Saturday night?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.159
Yeah.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.793
Only if you promise to
bring it back really

00:59.827 --> 01:03.797
dirty and totally out of gas.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.166
Well, Mark's truck
is in the shop.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.435
So I'm driving us
to the spring dance.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.902
Spring dance.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.071
Boy, does that
bring back memories.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.975
Yeah Waiting around for weeks
for some cool guy to ask you.

01:15.008 --> 01:19.012
And then ending up going with
some loser like Glen Dickerson.

01:19.046 --> 01:19.913
Why?

01:19.947 --> 01:21.982
Was he a geek or something?

01:22.015 --> 01:22.883
Ask Jackie.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.717
It's her memory.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.487
No.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.855
He was not a geek.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.392
He was the only kid in 10th
grade that carried a lunch box.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.326
OK, champ.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.528
Let's ice down
that pitching arm.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.429
How was the game?

01:35.463 --> 01:36.597
Oh, it was OK.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.498
OK?

01:37.531 --> 01:39.333
She was throwing BBs out there.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.268
[phone rings]

01:40.301 --> 01:41.101
BECKY: I'll get it.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.639
11 strikeouts.
No walks.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.107
She made their best hitter cry.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.008
Yeah.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.109
I beaned her right in the neck.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.278
Wow.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.645
That was an accident, right?

01:51.679 --> 01:54.682
Grow up.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.683
It's for you, Darlene.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.784
It's Barry.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.086
Yeah?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.454
Hey, Barry.
How are you doing?

02:00.488 --> 02:01.655
Hey.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.756
Did Crystal drop anything
off for me here today?

02:02.790 --> 02:03.691
There's an envelope
there on the counter.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.658
Yes.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.560
Thanks to my
well-connected father,

02:06.594 --> 02:09.463
I now possess two tickets
to the Bulls playoff

02:09.497 --> 02:10.864
game this Saturday night.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.667
Well, don't expect me to go
to a baseball game with you.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.336
It's basketball, Roseanne.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.570
Ah, get off my back.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.373
The answer still no.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.942
Damn, I guess I'll have
to find somebody else then.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.544
Hey, I like basketball.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.445
Really.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.346
How fascinating.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.348
But you know?

02:27.381 --> 02:30.651
I think I'm going to
surprise Darlene with these.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.653
How bizarre.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.754
That was Barry.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.123
And he just invited me
to the spring dance.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.060
Well, all right, Butch.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.462
When is this thing, Darlene?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.431
Oh, it's this Saturday night.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.598
Saturday, huh?

02:44.632 --> 02:45.499
Yeah.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.134
Can you drive us?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.135
No problem.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.036
Oh,

02:49.069 --> 02:50.438
Darlene.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.472
Congratulations.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.374
It's your first formal dance.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.943
God, you'll remember this
for the rest of your life.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.579
Honey, what are
you going to wear?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.180
Well, I was thinking
I'd go down to the mall--

03:00.214 --> 03:01.081
Sh, sh, sh.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.182
I'm not talking to you.

[cackle]

03:50.298 --> 03:53.667
[music playing]

03:57.771 --> 03:59.139
OK.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.477
So whatever I decide that
Darlene likes best, we'll keep.

04:03.511 --> 04:09.683
And what do you think of these
shoes with that blue dress?

04:09.717 --> 04:10.584
Oh, clash.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.619
You know?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.321
What about something
with an open toe?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.221
No.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.524
Nobody wants to see her feet.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.425
Ah, Roseanne.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.826
And Bonnie.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.193
Hi, Leon.

04:20.227 --> 04:24.465
This is Linda Wagner from Rod
Bell's company headquarters.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.468
She's here to see how
hard we're always working.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
Oh cool.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.804
Hey, Linda.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.607
What do you think of these
shoes with this dress?

04:33.641 --> 04:34.442
I think they work.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.848
Roseanne is sort of
our restaurant cut up.

04:40.881 --> 04:41.882
Let's try this again.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.884
Shall we?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.854
Miss Wagner is here
to look over our store

04:46.887 --> 04:50.458
and evaluate our employees.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.493
That doesn't mean I have
to take a lie detector test,

04:52.526 --> 04:54.094
does it?

04:54.127 --> 04:57.164
Because every time I take
one of them, I get fired.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.599
- Oh god.
- No.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.868
What I'd really like to do is
just conduct a short interview

05:00.901 --> 05:02.135
with each of you.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.371
Fantastic.
OK.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.472
Who would like to start?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.273
Roseanne, I think I
see your hand up there.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.174
Perfect.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.442
All right, Bonnie.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.943
Why don't we just
leave these two

05:09.977 --> 05:15.182
alone to chat while we tidy up
and serve our happy customers?

05:15.215 --> 05:18.352
I promise this
won't take long.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.221
Well, now this ain't one
of those "if I could be

05:21.254 --> 05:24.892
any animal on earth, what animal
would I be" kind of deals,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.193
is it?

05:26.226 --> 05:27.661
No.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.296
Let me start by asking
you about your boss.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.197
Oh.

05:30.230 --> 05:33.801
So it is an animal question.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.769
I was wondering, is he single?

05:35.803 --> 05:37.004
Leon?

05:37.037 --> 05:40.273
Of course he's single.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.642
Well, I find him
very attractive.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.743
Don't you?

05:42.776 --> 05:45.446
Well, OK.

05:45.479 --> 05:49.116
I suppose that in
kind of an off beat--

05:49.149 --> 05:50.518
oh, what the hell?

05:50.551 --> 05:53.220
Put me down for no.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.955
There's just
something about him.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.225
He's got this
mysterious charisma.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.861
Uh huh.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.195
It's strange.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.498
The second I looked at him,
this voice in my head said,

06:04.532 --> 06:08.569
I want that man.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.070
How long you've been
on the road, Linda?

06:12.973 --> 06:14.842
Almost six weeks.
Why?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.877
Time to go home.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.480
[music playing]

06:21.549 --> 06:24.918
Darlene, would you
please come down here?

06:24.952 --> 06:27.521
Jeez, where is she?
I want to see some action.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.857
Oh, oh, you know
this is so exciting.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.625
Sometimes I wish my
Lonny was a little girl

06:31.659 --> 06:34.728
so I could get him all
dolled up in a pretty dress.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.299
I don't do that, of course.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.138
Oh well, take my breath away.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.574
This is exquisite.

06:46.607 --> 06:50.310
Obviously a woman of taste.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.278
You look weird.

06:51.311 --> 06:54.014
You smell weird.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.215
What?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.851
Hm.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.521
Try on the blue one.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.089
Why?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.324
Because I really don't
know how I feel about this

07:04.357 --> 07:07.027
dress until I see
you in the blue one.

07:07.060 --> 07:07.995
Oh God.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.767
Becky.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.768
Go with her.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.237
Don't leave her alone
with that dress.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.174
[music playing]

07:21.208 --> 07:22.610
This is a joke, right?

07:22.643 --> 07:23.511
No.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.745
It's not bad.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.846
Well, come on.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.080
I mean you've been to
these things before.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.682
Is this going to work?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.518
Well, that depends on
what you're going as.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.418
Yeah.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.521
Well, what are you wearing?

07:33.554 --> 07:34.688
Oh I decided not to go.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.289
These things are so immature.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.157
Mark bailed.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.726
Huh?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.427
Well, it was kind
of awkward for him.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.730
I mean, the Spanish teacher
he was dating in 11th grade

07:42.763 --> 07:45.432
is going to be chaperone.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.333
OK.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.568
You want to look in the mirror?

07:47.601 --> 07:48.401
Sure.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.774
Oh, why did I do that?

07:53.807 --> 07:54.675
OK.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.776
She wants to see the blue dress.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.144
Let's show her the blue dress.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.087
It's too blue.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.292
Looked better on the hanger.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.397
Rhubarb with hair.

08:21.201 --> 08:25.305
Makes too much
noise when I walk.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.306
Makes me look lopsided.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.313
Well, you do look
like Judy Jetson.

08:39.019 --> 08:39.887
Yeah.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.388
Yeah.

08:41.421 --> 08:44.324
This is definitely it.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.126
Mhm.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.461
Mom, this is the
first one that I had on.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.362
I know that.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.463
But these shoes.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.665
You see, they totally
make the difference.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.733
They make the outfit.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.901
Am I right?
- Oh yeah.

08:53.934 --> 08:54.802
Nice shoes.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.703
Yeah.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.938
The shoes, definitely.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.840
See, but now you're going
to have to start shaving

08:59.873 --> 09:02.109
your legs below the sock line.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.745
Those aren't socks.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.213
Oh, Dan.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.449
Come on in here and meet your
beautiful, young daughter.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.350

You look incredible.

see her in the yellow one.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.256
- Mom.
- No, no, no, no.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.490
This is perfect.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.826
Besides, I have the first dance.

09:18.859 --> 09:19.960
May I?

09:19.993 --> 09:21.494
Oh, just shoot me now.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.639
You really do
look nice, you know.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.740
Thanks.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.207
And you dance divinely.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.576
I'm stepping all
over your feet.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.378
I happen to enjoy that.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.546
I hate slow dancing.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.681
Well, listen.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.916
If this Barry guy tries
to hold you too close,

09:42.950 --> 09:44.618
just tell him you're
going to throw up.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.586
Oh I thought I'd save that
for when he wants to have sex.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.826
Gotta go.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.762
Mom, I'm going to go
change into human clothes.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.129
Oh no.
No.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.799
We've got to decide what we're
going to do about your hair.

09:58.832 --> 09:59.933
Stop it.

09:59.967 --> 10:00.834
No.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.035
I like my hair the way it is.

10:02.069 --> 10:02.970
I know what we'll do.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.537
We'll go and get a makeover.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.239
We'll all go together
Saturday before the dance.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.140
No.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.041
Forget it.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.242
Come on, Darlene.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.711
This is something I always
wanted to do with you.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.781
It'd be like a girl thing.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.749
Mom, I have
practice on Saturday.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.850
Well, you can just miss it.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.251
No, I can't.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.853
If I miss practice, I might not
get to start in the next game.

10:19.887 --> 10:20.954
Well, gee.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.255
Darlene, this is your
first formal dance.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.657
It's way more important.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.557
Yeah?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.059
Well, then why don't you go?

10:26.093 --> 10:27.527
Because I have
nothing to wear.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.702
[door slam]

10:39.139 --> 10:40.540
Well you better go practice.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.642
You missed me by a mile.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.543
Hey, hey.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.578
That's not paid for yet.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.479
Take it back.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.380
Take them all back.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.716
I'll get my own dress.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.883
You pick it up.

10:49.917 --> 10:50.918
No.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.385
Pick it up, Darlene.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.386
Why?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.822
So you can play
Barbie doll some more?

10:54.855 --> 10:55.723
Forget it.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.924
What are you talking about?

10:56.957 --> 11:00.660
I bought you a beautiful
dress for the dance.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.795
Oh, give me a break.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.130
Why don't you give me
this kind of attention

11:03.163 --> 11:04.865
when I do real stuff
like striking out 11

11:04.898 --> 11:08.301
guys without walking anybody?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.402
OK.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.237
Way to go.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.605
Yeah.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.107
You ever brag about that
to Jackie and Crystal?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.475
No.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.477
But all of a sudden, some guy
asked me to some lame dance

11:17.510 --> 11:19.146
and I'm a big deal.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.981
That's so sick.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.383
Well, how come you never said
anything about this before now?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.985
Oh why bother?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.253
No.
You come here.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.654
I want to talk about
this some more.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.555
Fine.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.823
Go ahead.

11:29.857 --> 11:30.791
Man.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.860
You are such a spoiled brat--

11:32.893 --> 11:37.197
[music playing]

11:47.640 --> 11:49.709
Roseanne?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.712
I told you I wanted every
customer to have a flower.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.781
Oh, not now, Leon.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.716
I ain't in the mood.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.752
Roseanne, this customer
does not have a flower.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.687
So find a vase and give him one.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.965
Well, someone forgot to take
her polite pill this morning.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.666
Huh?

12:13.700 --> 12:14.835
Leon, why don't you lay off?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.804
She's having a bad day.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.505
Good afternoon, everybody.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.107
Ms. Wagner.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.208
For you.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.543
A freshly cut spring flower.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.612
How sweet.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.713
Hey, Leon.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.981
I've got to get
out of here early

12:28.015 --> 12:29.282
so I can go to my
kid's baseball game.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.183
No.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.284
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.786
This is our evaluation day.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.621
Remember?

12:34.654 --> 12:38.158
Now, please have a seat.

12:38.191 --> 12:43.563
And observe your well-oiled
Rod Bell's machine in action.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.903
I have a better idea.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.639
Shoot.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.876
Why don't the two of us find a
nice little Italian restaurant,

12:55.909 --> 12:59.679
order a bottle of Chianti,
and get to know each other?

12:59.712 --> 13:00.580
Whoa.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.315
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.284
Way too much information
in that sentence.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.124
These evaluations
are just so dull.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.727
I thought we could find
something more exciting to do.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.369
You're coming on
to me here, right?

13:22.402 --> 13:25.172
I'm trying.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.375
Well, I would like
a cup of coffee.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.977
Would you like a cup of coffee?

13:30.010 --> 13:30.810
Sure.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.482
Go for it, stud.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.584
No way.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.651
Come on, Leon.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.020
Where else are you
going to find a woman

13:40.053 --> 13:43.790
that good-looking
and that desperate?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.724
Nope.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.359
Not interested.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.261
Well, go on over there.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.297
You know, if you take
her out, I can leave.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.600
So stop acting like you've got
some integrity and go do it.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.734
No.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.204
I'm not looking for this
kind of relationship.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.972
Oh, she don't want
no relationship.

13:59.006 --> 14:03.010
She just wants a
little slap and tickle.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.912
Think of it as a
career move, Leon.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.246
Yeah, Leon.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.948
Maybe you'll get promoted to
some restaurant where, like,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.650
the employees respect you.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.219
Look, I'm not
sleeping with her

14:12.252 --> 14:14.821
just so you can go home early.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.756
Jeez, ask you for
one little favor.

14:21.528 --> 14:26.699
Linda, I really
appreciate your offer.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.936
It's very flattering.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.439
But I'm already
seeing somebody else.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.406
You are not.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.241
Am too.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.078
Leon, don't worry.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.647
It's OK.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.849
But it could have been fun.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.750
OK.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.953
Let's talk about
this restaurant.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.055
Thank you.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.722
Rosie, am I missing
something here?

14:49.756 --> 14:52.059
I mean, what does
she see in him?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.793
Oh.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.295
I mean if you were
single, would you even--

14:55.328 --> 14:56.229
No.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.464
Well, what if he
was, like, rich?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.365
No.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.366
Or like a movie star?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.567
- No.
- Royalty or something?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.468
Uh huh, no.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.402
Uh huh.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.670
If he were the
last man on earth?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.805
I'd demand a recount.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.608
[music playing]

15:10.543 --> 15:11.945
DAN: I didn't think I
could use the tickets

15:11.979 --> 15:14.281
so I gave them to a friend.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.482
Yeah, Dad.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.750
I know how hard it was for
you to get the tickets.

15:17.784 --> 15:21.621
But well, now Darlene
is not going to dance.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.891
So OK.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.094
How many coffee filters
would you have to sell for me

15:27.127 --> 15:29.396
to get two more tickets?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.297
OK.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.033
Put me down for 25,000.

15:33.066 --> 15:33.933
Yeah, Dad.

15:33.967 --> 15:34.801
See what you could do.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.603
Thanks.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.505
Honey, the kids are going to
have to start drinking coffee.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.310
What's this about Darlene's
not going to the dance?

15:43.343 --> 15:46.013
Yeah.
She called Barry and backed out.

15:46.046 --> 15:46.913
Damn it.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.648
I knew that was going to happen.

15:48.681 --> 15:52.152
Now I have to go talk to her.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.622
The thing is, Dan,
this is all my fault.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.158
Imagine that.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.593
I mean, you spend all your
life trying to teach your kids

16:00.627 --> 16:02.529
that they are always wrong
and then something like this

16:02.562 --> 16:03.496
has to go and happen.

16:06.933 --> 16:07.734
Darlene.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.240
Hi.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.407
Hey.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.243
Can I come in?

16:16.276 --> 16:19.412
I guess so.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.148
Well, I tried to get
off early from work today

16:21.181 --> 16:22.982
so I could go to your practice.

16:23.016 --> 16:23.950
Yeah.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.186
Well, we don't
practice on Fridays.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.354
Oh well, good.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.822
Then I didn't miss anything.

16:29.856 --> 16:30.990
When's the next game?

16:31.024 --> 16:31.891
It's all right, Mom.

16:31.924 --> 16:32.959
You don't have to come.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.027
No.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.262
Next time you bean
somebody in the neck,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.564
I want to be there
cheering you on.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.865
Fine.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.768
Then you'd just better know
that when I pitch, I spit.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.635
So?

16:42.669 --> 16:46.106
When I dust, I spit.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.407
I've got a great idea.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.341
I just thought of this.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.976
Hey.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.645
You ought to call up Barry
and tell him that you

16:52.679 --> 16:53.846
will go to the dance, you know?

16:53.880 --> 16:56.416
And just wear whatever you
want and have your hair

16:56.449 --> 16:58.551
how ever you want it.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.853
No.

17:00.887 --> 17:01.954
Come on, Darlene.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.690
Don't miss out on this
just to get back at me.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.058
There's better ways
to get back at me.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.194
Maybe Becky's boyfriend
has a little brother.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.365
Mom, I didn't blow the
dance because of you.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.501
I mean, it was a lot of things.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.336
Like every time I would
put on those dresses,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.505
everybody would start
treating me weird.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.873
I just didn't feel like
the same person anymore.

17:20.907 --> 17:26.679
Well, you know, you kind of
are not quite like same person

17:26.713 --> 17:27.580
anymore.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.415
You know?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.922
Well.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.258
Sorry, I guess I
shouldn't do that.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.027
That's OK.

17:41.060 --> 17:45.932
Look, I just may never
get into proms and stuff.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.767
I mean I like dating
and boys and everything.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.102
It's just that I
don't think you should

17:49.136 --> 17:53.640
have to go through all the
crap to get to the good stuff.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.542
You've been hanging out
with Aunt Jackie too much.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.412
Look.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.248
I'm sorry that I threw
that dress on the floor.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.249
It's OK.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.251
They took it back.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.219
Hey, I did buy you these
shoes, though, that I think

18:06.253 --> 18:07.120
you'll really, really like.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.121
Here.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.956
Mom, I can't wear
those high heels.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.891
Now just open the box.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.725
Oh man.

18:17.964 --> 18:18.765
Golf shoes?

18:22.235 --> 18:25.572
Mom, you got me golf shoes?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.539
Oh.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.310
You mean they're
not baseball shoes?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.212
I should have listened
to the sales guy.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.714
I just thought these
were way cuter.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.584
[music playing]

18:39.419 --> 18:40.287
Let's go, Dad.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.721
It's almost time for tip off.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.658
I had to change
into my lucky sweats.

18:45.692 --> 18:49.529
Man, this is going to be way
better than some stupid dance.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.698
Hey, I'll bet you $5 Jordan
pulls a triple double.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.599
What are you?

18:52.632 --> 18:53.666
Nuts?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.001
You'd have to be crazy
to take that bet.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.436
Well, I'll give you the odds.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.606
No way.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.208
So where'd Mom run
off to hide this time?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.375
Jackie's.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.011
Oh, you know she's coming
to your game Monday.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.646
Yeah, I know.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.980
Hey, you don't think
if it's, like, cold

19:08.014 --> 19:09.048
out, she'll run out
to the pitcher's

19:09.081 --> 19:10.082
mound to give me my sweater?

19:10.116 --> 19:11.150
Do you?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.052
I think you can
pretty much count on it.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.221
As a matter of
fact, she's probably

19:14.254 --> 19:15.688
sewing your baseball
mitt onto the sleeve

19:15.722 --> 19:18.725
of your uniform right now.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.059
Oh here they come.

19:20.092 --> 19:24.697
Bulls, Bulls, Bulls,
Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.598
Aw, man.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.533
Let it ring.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.434
That's all right.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.968
I'll get it.
Come on, man.

19:29.001 --> 19:29.769
Put it up.
Put it up.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.037
Foul, foul.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.639
Get in the game.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.174
Speak.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.043
Barry, hey.

19:37.076 --> 19:37.944
No.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.679
I'm not mad at you.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.482
No, I thought you
were mad at me.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.251
Pizza?

19:44.284 --> 19:46.386
Now?

19:46.419 --> 19:49.789
Well, I'm kind of watching
the game with my dad.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.023
Well, I don't know.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.828
Sure I can ditch him.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.729
Yeah.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.631
I'll see you in like 10.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.568
OK, bye.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.735
Sorry, Dad.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.571
Try to be back by dawn.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.472
Yeah.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.406
We'll play it by ear.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.245
What are you up to, Filbert?

20:12.279 --> 20:14.814
Nothing.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.284
Hey, Deej.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.119
Who do you like in the playoff?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.521
What's a playoff?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.489
Ho-ho-ho.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.123
Park it right here, bud.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.193
I'll tell you all about it.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.695
You got any money?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.564
[music]

20:39.472 --> 20:41.808
Well, another
day, another dollar.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.909
Huh, ladies?

20:42.942 --> 20:45.144
Well, I haven't exactly
counted my tips yet.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.245
But that sounds about right.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.449
Hey, Leon.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.551
How'd we do on that evaluation?

20:51.584 --> 20:54.086
Well, somehow
we did very well.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.455
Well, then it was
probably a good thing

20:55.488 --> 20:56.923
that you didn't sleep with her.

20:56.956 --> 21:00.159
Because, you know, we
might have all got fired.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.294
Hello, Leon.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.194
You ready?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.095
Yeah.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.298
Almost.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.899
Oh, there's my blue shirt.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.335
I was looking all over
for that this morning.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.005
Sorry.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.708
Roseanne, Bonnie, this is
my friend, Jerry Gimble.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.109
- Oh hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.210
How do you do?
- Nice to meet you, too.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.312
Hi.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.815
Leon had told me so
much about both of you.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.618
So Leon, we do have 7
o'clock dinner reservations.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.420
And I'm sure that Phil
and Tom are already there.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.455
So perhaps--
- OK.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.288
OK.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.726
Do it all again
tomorrow, shall we?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.161
ROSEANNE: Definitely.
All righty.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.963
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

21:36.996 --> 21:37.497
Bye.
- See you.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.638
Oh.
