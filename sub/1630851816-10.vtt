WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:51.885 --> 00:52.927
Oh, sir.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.972
I didn't know
you had such a sentimental side.

00:57.057 --> 00:57.932
Actually,

00:58.016 --> 01:01.311
I happened to come here since it's near
the restaurant you recommended.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.520
Oh, gosh.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.232
I can't remember when I last came here.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.401
Well, you were busy
with your career in politics.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.153
That's also true.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.697
It's strange

01:12.781 --> 01:15.575
how I feel depressed whenever I come here.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.287
So I hardly come near this place.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.330
I'm surprised.

01:20.997 --> 01:24.209
You're a powerful senator,
but you've also got a soft side.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.461
-You think so?
-Yes, sir.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.298
Well, thanks to you, I got to come here.

01:31.382 --> 01:35.303
You can't deny that some people
just form an instant connection.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.430
-Don't you agree with that?
-Yes, I do.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.308
Speaking of which…

01:40.975 --> 01:43.269
Well, I don't have anything
particular to discuss.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.482
But you did hear about it, right?
Jo Kyung-ho escaped the institute.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.946
Well, I thought we should talk
about that matter today.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.531
I see.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.829
There's a favor I'd like to ask.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.248
I'll do whatever I can, sir.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.583
It's a simple favor.

02:06.543 --> 02:10.046
You just have to rope in Choi Hyung-in.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.105
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho, did you sleep well?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.733
Hope it wasn't too warm
for you last night.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.070
I find this room to be too hot.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.156
It was fine.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.908
It was? You'll be moved to
a regular hospital room

02:38.992 --> 02:42.412
in two days at the most
once you finish all the medical tests.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.206
But you'll undergo
a battery of tests today.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.624
Is that fine with you?

02:46.708 --> 02:47.959
It doesn't bother me.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.921
All right.
You should start having breakfast first.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.592
I think the menu is quite good today.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.435
Jo Kyung-ho is missing.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.689
Even though he was under surveillance
for 24 hours,

03:10.940 --> 03:12.275
he somehow managed to escape

03:12.358 --> 03:14.235
the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry
in just three days.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.460
May I ask you something?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.337
Go ahead.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.634
Mr. Sohn,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.972
why are you asking me
about who Guru could be

04:24.555 --> 04:27.141
after telling me that Jo Kyung-ho
has escaped from prison?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.018
It doesn't make any sense.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.228
I thought

04:30.979 --> 04:32.855
the prosecutors have concluded

04:33.731 --> 04:37.443
that the incidents in Saju were committed
by the Youngjin Sect.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.862
In that case, naming Jung Young-seob as

04:39.946 --> 04:42.490
the cult leader, Guru,
would make things so much easier.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.242
As I told you before,

04:44.325 --> 04:47.078
there are some discrepancies
that indicate Jung Young-seob

04:47.829 --> 04:49.789
might not be the actual cult leader.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.876
So you'd like to know the truth?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.045
Is that it?

04:59.507 --> 05:00.633
Of course.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.101
How did Jo Kyung-ho escape?

05:11.102 --> 05:12.020
What?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.607
He killed three nurses.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.527
One janitor,

05:19.610 --> 05:20.987
and a prison guard.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.197
He slashed five people.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.576
No. There's a fourth nurse
who is in critical condition.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.910
So that makes it six.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.497
After committing these acts,
he simply walked out of the facility?

05:35.126 --> 05:36.544
Now I have a question for you.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.463
In your entire career,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.924
how many criminals have you seen
who could pull this off?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.384
I'm telling you again.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.636
I met with Guru.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.182
If he wasn't actually Guru,

05:50.058 --> 05:53.770
then Guru might not be a person,
but a symbolic figure.

05:53.853 --> 05:54.979
Some people

05:56.105 --> 05:57.774
can exist

05:59.776 --> 06:01.194
even though they don't have a name.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.532
In some cases,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.578
they can exist on a higher plane
than a human.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.797
You're feeling very relaxed, right?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.342
When you take it for the first time,
the symptoms can be intense.

06:25.009 --> 06:25.968
Drink this.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.013
What is it?

06:30.223 --> 06:33.184
Why do you ask?
You think I put something in it?

06:33.810 --> 06:34.811
It's a sports drink.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.604
You'll feel much better
if you drink it now.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.453
You won't feel thirsty after a while.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.956
So you should drink when you can.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.264
Do you have a scissor I can borrow?

07:13.015 --> 07:14.767
-A scissor?
-Yes.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.274
Here you are.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.827
You didn't hear anything?

07:34.078 --> 07:35.705
What are you talking about?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.374
Anything about me.

07:39.667 --> 07:40.793
I don't know.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.921
Is there anything I'm supposed to know?

07:44.005 --> 07:45.089
Tell me.

07:45.756 --> 07:46.799
Did you?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.011
Yeah, I did.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.930
I heard a few things before you got here.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.057
It was like a warning.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.643
They told me not to get too close to you.

07:58.895 --> 07:59.937
And don't speak to you.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.939
Then why are you behaving like this?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.942
Aren't you afraid of dying?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.488
I don't know.
I don't think about dying that much.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.408
But I'm not afraid of you.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.038
You're not death incarnate, you know.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.332
Is that so?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.793
I take that back.

08:22.877 --> 08:27.381
Even if you're death incarnate,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.217
I'd still act the same.

08:31.010 --> 08:35.097
I would treat you just the same as
any other inmate.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.684
That's the purpose of my work here.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.693
Why are you smirking?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.572
Just because.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.575
You remind me of someone.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.540
Can I ask you who that person is?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.708
She's a woman who died long ago.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.711
That's all.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.881
She said

09:10.341 --> 09:12.885
something similar to what you said.

09:21.852 --> 09:24.146
The reason you're not afraid of death is

09:25.565 --> 09:29.151
because you can't see it coming.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.074
But how would you react
if the situation were to change?

09:37.910 --> 09:41.372
If death were to be at your door,
waiting to strike?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.129
If you…

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
were to see death…

10:03.894 --> 10:05.688
right before your eyes.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.322
Choi Hyung-in.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.200
The first time I heard that name,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.745
I saw the end of the future.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.833
I saw a vision where
I was pointing the gun at my head.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.251
Ever since then,

10:28.210 --> 10:31.714
I see that in my mind every day.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.885
Let me ask you again.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.267
Are you afraid of death right now?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.438
Are you afraid of me?

11:16.801 --> 11:22.098
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

11:51.168 --> 11:52.461
Damn it.

12:40.676 --> 12:41.844
Jo Kyung-ho

12:42.928 --> 12:44.054
is missing.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.225
Even the prosecutors don't know
where he is.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.105
-I see.
-He was last staying

12:53.856 --> 12:55.441
at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.236
The Institute of Forensic Psychiatry?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.696
Inmates who suffer

13:01.322 --> 13:04.241
a mental breakdown
are sent there sometimes.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.453
Only in special cases, of course.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.748
I see.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.837
I don't know how he ended up there,

13:16.921 --> 13:20.633
but I think we can find some clues
if we check out the place.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.142
Are you feeling okay?

13:30.935 --> 13:34.271
You're still recovering. I'm afraid
you're pushing yourself too hard.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.915
No.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.252
We don't have time.
Jo Kyung-ho is very dangerous.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.673
We have to track him down
as soon as possible.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.051
Okay.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.990
Is it okay? Is nobody around?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.909
Yes, I think you can come out.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.923
Wow.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.218
I've never been here before. It's new.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.686
Shi-young.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.688
What's the matter?

14:57.771 --> 14:59.648
What? I'm sorry.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.652
Let's head to the food storage room
in the kitchen.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.905
There's a backdoor.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.920
You can go through here.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.429
It's too dark, isn't it?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.308
Yes. Be careful.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.399
It's so dark.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.445
I'm sorry, Jae-young.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.283
Shi-young.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.578
What are you doing? Don't play games.

16:06.215 --> 16:09.468
This videotape was the beginning
that led me to this place.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.720
And all my life,

16:13.055 --> 16:16.308
I've hung on to every word he uttered.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.357
I'm the only one left

16:24.858 --> 16:26.777
among my group that saw the video.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.868
Do you believe, Successor?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.958
Guru is coming.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.962
The Day of Purification is near.

16:45.754 --> 16:46.880
But…

16:47.589 --> 16:50.384
what are you trying to do
during this important time?

16:51.552 --> 16:55.764
Did you really think you could
slip out of this place like a mouse?

16:57.808 --> 17:00.310
You broke your promise to us.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.398
You are the one
who broke your promise first.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.527
You told me that my aunt
would be safe if I stayed here.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.654
I kept my promise.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.992
Your aunt kept snooping around
and acted recklessly.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.661
That's an excuse.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.082
I can't believe anything you say anymore.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.838
You won't believe me?

17:31.425 --> 17:32.843
Why can't you believe me?

17:39.016 --> 17:41.143
If you don't believe me,
then what will you do?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.936
What can you do?

17:43.687 --> 17:46.982
If it weren't for me,
you would already be dead!

17:48.025 --> 17:50.736
Despite being Guru's daughter,
you're not capable of doing anything.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.911
What are you planning to do with that?

17:59.953 --> 18:02.122
I can't do anything?

18:03.874 --> 18:05.584
Is that what you really think?

18:06.293 --> 18:09.046
If something were to happen to me

18:09.838 --> 18:11.590
and Guru would hear about it…

18:14.510 --> 18:16.136
Who would be in trouble then?

18:17.054 --> 18:18.138
Answer me.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.183
Put down the knife.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.310
No, I won't.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.354
Until you keep your promise,
I'm not doing that.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.772
What promise are you talking about?

18:26.855 --> 18:30.651
If you ever try to hurt my aunt again
and something happens to her,

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
I'm going to leave this place.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.198
If I have to,

18:36.281 --> 18:39.451
I'll escape this place
by slashing my neck to kill myself.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.832
Please put down the knife.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.459
All right.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.920
I understand, Successor.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.174
I'll do as you say.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.386
So please…

18:59.304 --> 19:01.014
put down the knife.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.331
I pity…

19:28.709 --> 19:29.960
all of you.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.511
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

19:53.734 --> 19:55.444
Please make it as short as possible.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.572
The well-being of the patient
is most important.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.656
Okay.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.417
Hello, Mr. Kim Hee-yeon.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.837
I'm from the mobile investigation unit.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.465
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.008
I know it'll be hard to answer,

20:18.091 --> 20:21.261
but if you can provide some answers,
it will be of great help.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.851
We were told

20:29.228 --> 20:31.521
that you were in charge of Jo Kyung-ho.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.981
And your coworkers told me

20:33.690 --> 20:36.109
you interacted with him several times.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.906
If you talked with Jo Kyung-ho,

20:41.490 --> 20:44.368
is there anything
you'd like to share with us?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.662
Even a minor detail would be helpful.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.292
Did he do anything out of the ordinary?

20:52.376 --> 20:55.003
-Did he flash a light in front of you--
-Is your name

20:57.047 --> 20:58.840
Choi Hyung-in?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.598
-How did you know my name?
-He said he'd let me live

21:06.682 --> 21:11.395
under the condition that
I send you this message.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.444
Everything is how I said it would be.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.531
I will be waiting now.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.451
In the place where my daughter was born.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.492
Detective Choi, do you have time
to talk for a minute?

22:09.328 --> 22:10.537
Sure.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.875
The hot chocolate here is pretty good.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.668
Sure.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.306
Don't let what Jo Kyung-ho said

22:30.307 --> 22:32.225
bother you too much.

22:32.309 --> 22:36.188
We just need to stick to the plan
and continue searching for your niece.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.567
Right.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.156
What could be the end of the future
that the Youngjin Sect

22:48.075 --> 22:49.409
keeps talking about?

22:50.494 --> 22:51.870
What on earth is it?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.123
Why are they trying to draw us there?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.418
To be honest,

23:00.003 --> 23:02.714
I'd like to see what that future
will be at this point.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.970
I'm sorry for saying such stupid things.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.847
Not at all.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.392
All right.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.104
I'll see you here tomorrow in the morning.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.730
Sorry for all this trouble.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.192
I'll have this cast removed in a few days,
so please help me until then.

23:22.275 --> 23:26.738
Don't mention it. I'm thankful that you
came along even though it was a day off.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.157
I'd like to help out and drive you around.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.118
Thank you.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.306
Excuse me.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.016
Can you send

23:56.017 --> 23:58.812
a message to Shi-young?

24:00.021 --> 24:02.232
He used to bring me my meals before.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.486
It's not anything complicated.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.865
You just have to tell him this.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.120
Shi-young.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.374
I'm not angry at you.

24:20.625 --> 24:25.046
So don't feel guilty or anything
because of me.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.593
I don't regret what I did.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.641
And thank you so much

24:37.350 --> 24:39.144
for being my friend.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.912
<i>The number you have dialed cannot be…</i>

25:22.229 --> 25:25.065
Do you know what the end of the future

25:25.982 --> 25:27.359
means to the Youngjin Sect?

25:29.361 --> 25:30.570
Do you know now?

25:31.571 --> 25:34.074
The Day of Purification is a day

25:34.157 --> 25:36.826
when everyone holds each other hands

25:36.910 --> 25:40.413
and accepts an honorable death together.

25:40.497 --> 25:44.334
Is this related to the incident
at the water purification plant?

25:44.417 --> 25:47.796
That was just the beginning.

25:49.130 --> 25:52.467
The cult representative and senior leaders

25:52.550 --> 25:54.594
all want one thing.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.766
They want true salvation
by participating in his future.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.143
Jeez. It's…

26:02.227 --> 26:05.480
It's such an outdated notion.

26:05.563 --> 26:08.149
We're living in the 21st century.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.652
But they stick to
such old-fashioned ideas.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.237
So what I mean is,

26:13.071 --> 26:15.865
having you come here to see me right now

26:16.533 --> 26:18.743
is brilliant timing.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.537
That's how I see it.

26:20.620 --> 26:24.958
Since he is no longer in prison,
it'll be the beginning of

26:25.917 --> 26:28.003
the Day of Purification
once he returns here.

26:28.586 --> 26:32.507
That means your niece,
whom the cult call the "Successor,"

26:32.590 --> 26:34.634
will likely die too.

26:39.347 --> 26:41.599
-I'm surprised.
-About what?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.604
The public doesn't know that
Jo Kyung-ho has escaped from prison,

26:46.688 --> 26:48.356
but you say it so openly.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.699
I found it strange.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.910
I couldn't understand
why you approached me.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.579
You deny it,

27:03.913 --> 27:06.166
but you're part of the Youngjin Sect.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.169
Now I think I know why.

27:10.170 --> 27:14.424
You want to get rid of
the cult representative by using me.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.427
Oh my gosh.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.096
If someone were to hear that,
they'd think it's true.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.932
I already told you.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.186
I only care about what I can gain.

27:26.269 --> 27:29.689
That's why I wanted to work together
so we could both get what we wanted.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.025
If your heart
is not into this partnership,

27:32.108 --> 27:34.903
then you can walk out that door anytime.

27:34.986 --> 27:38.990
I do understand why this weighs
more heavily on you.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.243
Who would voluntarily walk into danger?

27:43.286 --> 27:44.788
If you decide to back out,

27:45.580 --> 27:48.124
nobody will hold it against you.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.755
I don't trust you.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.177
But I'm well aware that
I don't have a choice at this point.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.686
I'm not going to change the plan.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.481
Oh really?

28:12.190 --> 28:14.734
Well, that's good too.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.405
By the way,

28:19.531 --> 28:21.408
it's just out of curiosity.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.159
What's your reason?

28:24.119 --> 28:27.956
The situation has changed.
So once I get you inside,

28:28.039 --> 28:31.167
I can't guarantee your safety after that.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.676
Are you afraid of dying?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.263
What kind of question is that?

28:43.346 --> 28:45.473
Well, I'm afraid of dying.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.269
It makes me sad to think about the people

28:51.312 --> 28:53.606
I'll leave behind and how they'll mourn me

28:55.608 --> 28:57.360
if I were to die.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.823
That's the only reason

29:03.199 --> 29:05.243
I'm afraid of dying.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.503
You wouldn't understand.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.798
You've never loved anybody

29:20.049 --> 29:21.301
except yourself

29:23.011 --> 29:25.555
in your entire life.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.571
<i>-Yes, Senator.</i>
-Get my car ready.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.156
I have somewhere to go with a guest.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.451
Let's hurry before it rains harder.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.254
Wait, Mom!

30:52.892 --> 30:55.520
Mister, are you all right?

30:55.603 --> 30:57.397
Where are you going?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.816
We're heading into town.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.739
There won't be much to look at
since it's raining.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.411
If you change your mind, tell me.

31:12.161 --> 31:13.997
I can drop you off at the bus terminal.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.915
No, it's fine.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.210
Please drop me off
at that place I told you earlier.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.546
You can dry yourself with this.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.686
Mister, you're a security guard, right?

31:37.937 --> 31:39.689
I could tell because of your hat.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.317
I'm good at guessing someone's job.

31:42.817 --> 31:46.738
Seok-hyun, sit properly.
Don't bother him with questions.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.867
Mister, where do you live?

31:51.743 --> 31:52.827
I don't know.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.120
Where is your home?

31:54.621 --> 31:55.622
My home?

31:58.833 --> 32:00.919
I don't have a home.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.420
You don't have a home?

32:03.588 --> 32:05.715
-Why not?
-Seok-hyun, that's enough.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.675
I told you not to bother him.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.887
Oh, it's fine.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.514
He likes asking questions to people.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.350
You don't have to answer each of them.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.561
I never had a home.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.271
What about your family?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.190
My family?

32:23.441 --> 32:27.111
So family and a home
are very important to you it seems.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.280
Yes. Isn't it important to you, too?

32:30.740 --> 32:31.950
I don't know.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.662
All the people I knew have disappeared.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.871
Disappeared?

32:37.872 --> 32:38.915
Where did they go?

32:38.998 --> 32:40.792
Well, it's always like that.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.169
Once I know someone, they disappear.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.505
You said that you wanted to get off

32:45.588 --> 32:48.299
before we took a turn
to the market, right?

32:49.384 --> 32:50.385
Yes.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.096
I think we'll arrive there soon.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.890
Seok-hyun, now that's enough. Listen.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.475
Okay.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.359
-Do you know how to whistle?
-Whistle?

33:06.442 --> 33:08.277
I could whistle if you want to hear it.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.029
Yes. Please whistle for me.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.448
Mister.

33:13.491 --> 33:18.371
You're actually looking
for your family, aren't you?

33:19.205 --> 33:20.331
Right?

33:21.791 --> 33:25.378
I really hope you'll find your family.

33:26.671 --> 33:31.676
I won't ask you any more questions
so please whistle.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.143
-No.
-What?

33:40.727 --> 33:41.894
Why not?

33:42.854 --> 33:45.857
You won't whistle because I kept
bothering you with questions?

33:45.940 --> 33:47.900
I changed my mind.

33:49.777 --> 33:50.778
Here.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.259
Bye mister.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.182
Did Professor Jang

34:19.891 --> 34:21.559
send it, by any chance?

34:22.143 --> 34:24.270
Yes. Are you Mr. Lee?

34:24.353 --> 34:25.521
Yes.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.608
You're new. There was another person
who usually came.

34:28.691 --> 34:31.319
The professor sent this.

34:31.986 --> 34:32.862
Oh, I see.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.520
Help!

35:47.603 --> 35:49.605
Help! Is anyone out there?

35:49.689 --> 35:50.982
Help!

35:51.065 --> 35:53.776
Open the door! Help!

35:53.860 --> 35:54.986
Help!

36:21.470 --> 36:23.973
Help!

36:24.056 --> 36:27.059
There's a person in here! Open this door!

36:27.143 --> 36:29.145
Help!

36:29.228 --> 36:31.606
<i>Help! Is anyone there?</i>

36:31.689 --> 36:34.400
<i>There's a person in here.
Please open the door!</i>

36:35.109 --> 36:36.527
<i>Help!</i>

37:26.577 --> 37:27.870
Who are you?

37:28.788 --> 37:30.915
Oh, you're the detective, right?

37:34.210 --> 37:36.754
But she wouldn't forget
something like that.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.757
I wonder why she didn't call you first?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.136
Hey Jung-hyun.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.639
Are you still sleeping?

38:00.027 --> 38:01.737
TO MOM AND DETECTIVE CHOI

38:07.576 --> 38:08.869
<i>Mom.</i>

38:09.495 --> 38:10.579
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:11.414 --> 38:13.874
<i>There's not a lot of time left</i>

38:13.958 --> 38:16.294
<i>and this is the only way I can think of
that can stop this.</i>

38:17.586 --> 38:19.588
<i>I've always been proud of you.</i>

38:20.631 --> 38:23.301
<i>You're my hero.</i>

38:24.051 --> 38:26.637
<i>Forgive me for not being
more honest with you.</i>

38:27.972 --> 38:28.931
<i>Mom.</i>

38:29.682 --> 38:31.892
<i>I have one favor to ask.</i>

38:32.935 --> 38:37.398
<i>Please give this letter
to Detective Choi Hyung-in.</i>

38:39.150 --> 38:42.445
<i>You have to give him the address
I wrote down here.</i>

38:43.863 --> 38:46.407
<i>I'm sorry and I appreciate
all you've done.</i>

38:47.408 --> 38:50.745
<i>Please tell the detective
that I'll leave the rest to him.</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:53.873
<i>And tell him to</i>

38:53.956 --> 38:57.209
<i>take good care of Jae-young.</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:20.816
You're not going to jump, are you?

39:23.402 --> 39:25.654
This place has been my secret spot
for ten years.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.740
Don't do anything crazy.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.037
If you're going to commit suicide,
do it somewhere else.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.124
You're a funny-looking guy.

39:38.292 --> 39:41.128
Would you like some coffee?

40:20.167 --> 40:21.419
Who is it?

40:25.047 --> 40:27.299
-What?
-Mr. Lee.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.759
What are you doing here?

40:29.593 --> 40:32.263
Come inside first. It's raining.

40:45.609 --> 40:46.735
My place is a mess.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.531
This is how old people live.

40:50.614 --> 40:53.909
Did you come here
after talking to Professor Jang?

40:53.993 --> 40:55.327
Have a seat.

40:56.912 --> 40:58.539
Have some tea while you're here.

41:03.752 --> 41:04.795
I was making some

41:05.880 --> 41:07.465
for myself.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.147
Oh, did you come

41:23.898 --> 41:26.650
to talk about Kim Hwan-gyu?

41:27.234 --> 41:28.694
Then get straight to the point.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.405
I don't have

41:32.448 --> 41:34.617
much to say about it.

41:36.535 --> 41:41.624
I was about to call my grandson
and ask him to visit me.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.836
I didn't come to talk about him.

41:46.837 --> 41:47.755
Really?

41:47.838 --> 41:49.548
Then why are you here?

41:50.591 --> 41:52.092
How did you know my address?

41:52.176 --> 41:54.929
You mentioned someone
called Professor Jang.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.556
Is he the person
who belongs to the Skull Gang?

42:15.824 --> 42:17.493
You know…

42:19.828 --> 42:21.330
what people call me, don't you?

42:21.956 --> 42:23.457
The Human Butcher.

42:23.541 --> 42:27.753
I dedicated myself to my country
as a civil servant.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.839
And that's the kind of treatment I get.

42:30.923 --> 42:31.757
But one day,

42:32.424 --> 42:35.719
he appeared before me.

42:35.803 --> 42:40.266
And he said he would erase my past.

42:40.849 --> 42:41.892
He let me resume

42:43.352 --> 42:45.104
a normal life.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.315
I've never seen him in person.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.945
Through Professor Jang,
he would speak to me.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.740
Guru.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.035
Do you call him by that name too?

43:02.746 --> 43:03.914
Tell me now.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.584
Why did you come here?

43:10.879 --> 43:12.256
Where are you from?

43:13.048 --> 43:15.759
You don't seem to be from this area.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.974
Well, that's not important.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.229
I used to be a workaholic
when I was young.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.190
But now that I'm older, I've lost my way.

43:30.816 --> 43:33.402
After my wife died, life became so empty.

43:33.485 --> 43:36.405
I regret working so hard before.
What was it all for?

43:38.365 --> 43:40.284
Do you have any children?

43:42.369 --> 43:44.455
Yes, I have a son.

43:46.749 --> 43:48.292
He's sleeping over there.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.587
It's no fun here.

43:52.212 --> 43:54.089
But he always tags along
and keeps me company.

43:54.673 --> 43:55.841
I appreciate it.

43:56.884 --> 43:58.719
This spot is really nice, you see.

43:59.511 --> 44:02.640
You can't catch much fish here.
So nobody comes here.

44:03.474 --> 44:07.144
It's the perfect place

44:07.227 --> 44:09.188
to just talk with my son.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.568
No.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.112
You had two more kids.

44:20.449 --> 44:23.118
What? What are you talking about?

44:26.538 --> 44:29.124
A son and a daughter.

44:31.627 --> 44:34.922
You sold your kids
to the One Family Welfare Center.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.849
I was told that the person I'm looking for

44:46.684 --> 44:48.560
would be here.

44:48.644 --> 44:51.021
They didn't say
anyone would be visiting me today.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.356
Really?

44:52.940 --> 44:55.401
That could mean you or Professor Jang

44:56.318 --> 44:57.736
is hiding something.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.488
Pardon?

45:00.989 --> 45:02.366
What are you trying to say?

45:11.166 --> 45:12.543
Is there any chance that

45:13.585 --> 45:15.045
the videotape is inside your VCR player?

45:16.797 --> 45:18.590
A white wall. Red circle.

45:19.591 --> 45:20.676
And a woman walking upside down.

45:24.930 --> 45:27.141
Did you watch it right before I came?

45:28.142 --> 45:29.476
What if I did?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.104
Is it important?

45:43.657 --> 45:45.492
Now listen carefully.

45:46.076 --> 45:49.121
This Professor Jang no longer has
any use for you.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.123
That's why he sent you a video to watch.

45:52.082 --> 45:54.793
Now that you've watched that video,

45:55.836 --> 45:57.838
you will not be of sane mind
if my hunch is correct.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.590
I'm telling you that you could die.

46:09.349 --> 46:12.269
This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard in my life.

46:13.187 --> 46:16.273
Do you expect me to believe
what you just said?

46:16.356 --> 46:17.524
I don't care if you believe me or not.

46:18.650 --> 46:21.695
Whether you die or not is not my concern.

46:22.446 --> 46:25.324
But if you cooperate with me,
I can help you.

46:25.407 --> 46:26.575
I can prevent

46:27.367 --> 46:28.744
the worst from happening.

46:33.582 --> 46:34.666
There's no time.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.335
You have to decide now.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.463
Either answer my questions truthfully
and save your life

46:39.546 --> 46:42.674
or die a dog's death according
to Guru's grand vision.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.473
Are you hiding something behind the shelf?

46:50.349 --> 46:53.936
You're a book lover.
So you wouldn't use a book like that.

46:54.019 --> 46:56.438
You would've stacked
more books there instead.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.940
But if you were to do that,

46:58.023 --> 47:01.527
it would be a hassle to remove them
to access what's behind it.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.945
Are you holding Jo Jae-young

47:04.196 --> 47:06.240
captive behind that wall?

47:08.575 --> 47:11.161
Damn it.

47:11.912 --> 47:15.666
I should've burned down this house
when I had the chance.

47:15.749 --> 47:16.750
Answer my question!

47:16.833 --> 47:19.962
I'm an artist, you know.

47:21.129 --> 47:24.132
I can extract the truth out of people.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.510
You think it's easy to kill me?

47:26.593 --> 47:27.469
Wait.

47:28.637 --> 47:29.846
So you can see her now.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.557
-What?
-That woman.

47:38.188 --> 47:39.773
You can see her, right?

47:47.781 --> 47:49.658
What did you do to me?

47:49.741 --> 47:52.119
Answer me! Are you holding
Jo Jae-young captive?

47:52.202 --> 47:54.204
That's a lie. It's all a lie.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.081
-Answer me!
-He would never do that.

47:56.164 --> 47:59.793
He would never get rid of me. Because…

48:00.544 --> 48:01.878
I've been chosen!

48:04.381 --> 48:05.465
Damn it.

48:58.393 --> 48:59.728
Detective.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.398
Could you tell me your name?

49:27.506 --> 49:28.590
Did you know this?

49:30.217 --> 49:33.261
Even in that hellish
One Family Welfare Center,

49:34.137 --> 49:35.931
we were the only ones there

49:39.184 --> 49:42.312
who were sold by their own parents.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.358
You're a really pathetic human.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.153
You made such a foolish decision.

49:52.114 --> 49:54.241
I'm sorry.

49:56.159 --> 49:58.870
I had lost my mind back then.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.040
I had gone crazy.

50:04.543 --> 50:08.880
How could I have done that to you?

50:13.260 --> 50:14.886
No, you're wrong.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.390
That's not my point, stupid.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.730
Why did you sell us?
You should've killed us instead.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.859
First, me. And then my sister.

50:31.445 --> 50:33.572
After killing us by strangulation,

50:33.655 --> 50:36.533
you should have buried us
in a remote area.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.121
Your pathetic decision…

50:43.290 --> 50:45.292
brought you to this place.

50:55.343 --> 50:58.722
From now on,
you can't die even if you want to.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.668
I'll ask you one last question.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.004
Human Butcher.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.257
Did you ever regret what you did?

51:37.427 --> 51:40.764
If… If I had any regrets,

51:41.556 --> 51:44.267
would that change anything?

51:44.810 --> 51:48.605
Would that bring back to life
the people I killed?

51:49.815 --> 51:52.692
You think you're any different from me?

51:53.693 --> 51:56.279
Just because you can't remember
what you did

51:56.363 --> 51:59.950
doesn't make you different from me.

52:25.016 --> 52:27.853
This is the only way.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.355
At least

52:31.273 --> 52:35.318
you won't be able to kill your grandson
with your own hands if I cripple you.

52:37.571 --> 52:38.864
Don't close your eyes!

52:40.073 --> 52:41.366
Your sin

52:42.826 --> 52:44.286
has come to bite back.

53:05.724 --> 53:08.435
Oh, look at how savage they are.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.228
Look at what they're doing.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.355
Should I pull over?

53:13.064 --> 53:14.691
Of course. What did we do wrong?

53:14.774 --> 53:15.942
I'm sorry.

53:16.026 --> 53:19.529
Did you hand the tape to Mr. Lee?

53:19.613 --> 53:21.531
Yes, I delivered it to him.

53:22.532 --> 53:23.617
All right.

53:39.090 --> 53:42.385
Why are you making such a commotion?

53:42.469 --> 53:45.513
This won't change
what's already been decided.

53:49.601 --> 53:53.146
How dare you go against his decision!

53:53.730 --> 53:57.067
Have you forgotten who is Guru? Have you?

53:58.276 --> 53:59.486
Escort her now!

54:02.822 --> 54:03.823
You're heretics!

54:03.907 --> 54:05.158
She's a fake.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.914
-No!
-She's a fake! Don't let them in.

54:10.997 --> 54:14.292
-Don't let them in!
-Who do you think you are?

54:15.001 --> 54:17.337
-She's not real!
-Don't let her in!

54:23.009 --> 54:24.678
-What is this?
-What?

54:29.766 --> 54:33.436
They couldn't even carry out the plan
at the water purification plant properly.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.106
How could they be so arrogant?
Those worthless bastards.

54:36.189 --> 54:37.649
-Please enter now.
-Okay.

55:21.359 --> 55:24.612
-Don't be afraid. I'm…
-I know you.

55:25.488 --> 55:29.492
-What?
-I know who you are.

55:51.306 --> 55:53.183
Let's get out of here fast.

55:54.684 --> 55:56.770
-Stop it!
-You can't enter!

55:56.853 --> 55:58.480
-What are you doing?
-No way!

55:59.939 --> 56:01.066
Oh gosh!

56:03.193 --> 56:04.611
Open the door!

56:06.696 --> 56:09.657
What the hell? Did you not hear me?

56:09.741 --> 56:11.367
Where is the key?

56:11.451 --> 56:13.912
Please calm down, Master.
You must not do this.

56:13.995 --> 56:16.539
-Let go off my collar.
-You've gone crazy.

56:20.335 --> 56:21.461
Why those…

56:22.962 --> 56:25.757
-Stop it already!
-No, she's not the real one!

56:27.383 --> 56:28.426
That's…

56:55.411 --> 56:56.746
Thank you.

56:57.872 --> 56:59.624
Thank you.

57:05.964 --> 57:07.257
Grandma.

57:11.511 --> 57:12.637
Don't cry.

57:18.435 --> 57:19.644
I'm so sorry.

57:20.145 --> 57:22.689
I wanted to protect Aunt Jung-hyun.

57:23.731 --> 57:25.316
But I couldn't.

57:33.158 --> 57:35.201
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

58:00.268 --> 58:02.145
It's quite amazing, right?

58:03.104 --> 58:06.232
Maybe it's because you were wearing that.

58:06.316 --> 58:09.402
The followers were cowering in fear.

58:10.028 --> 58:12.739
So does it feel real now?

58:13.323 --> 58:14.574
You're the new Successor.

58:16.117 --> 58:17.285
So this is

58:18.620 --> 58:20.038
where Jae-young was kept.

58:21.039 --> 58:22.540
She was trapped here

58:24.334 --> 58:26.169
the whole time.

58:31.424 --> 58:33.426
Maybe things have finally returned to

58:34.969 --> 58:36.804
how they should be now.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.894
Even if I try to forget it.

58:47.315 --> 58:48.816
It started…

58:50.985 --> 58:52.153
with us.

58:59.494 --> 59:02.455
<i>You think you're any different from me?</i>

59:02.539 --> 59:04.541
<i>Just because you can't remember
what you did</i>

59:04.624 --> 59:07.961
doesn't make you different from me.

59:10.547 --> 59:13.091
<i>We have to cover up the incidents
that were revealed by the escapees</i>

59:13.174 --> 59:15.593
<i>from the welfare center
by blaming it on the manager, Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

59:15.677 --> 59:16.761
<i>Understand?</i>

59:39.909 --> 59:41.494
Gosh.

59:51.921 --> 59:53.464
Hey.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.302
Do you feel anything?

59:58.177 --> 1:00:01.014
When you're upside down,
does your perspective change?

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:04.892
Like a philosophical enlightenment
or something?

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:08.271
We've got mountains of evidence

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.815
regarding the despicable things
you did to the orphans

1:00:10.898 --> 1:00:12.650
at the One Family Welfare Center.

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:17.864
Abduction, illegal confinement, abuse…

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:22.410
You even buried kids
who were beaten to death in the hills.

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:25.288
What kind of person does that?

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:32.754
-Hey Kiddo, close the door.
-Okay.

1:00:32.837 --> 1:00:35.506
All the staff said
you were the supervisor.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:37.759
We have witness testimonies.

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:39.010
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:41.012
Answer the question!

1:00:41.888 --> 1:00:43.097
Manager Jo Kyung-ho!

1:00:43.931 --> 1:00:48.436
Oh boy. Let's get this interrogation done.

1:00:49.228 --> 1:00:50.313
Okay?

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:28.411
<i>-Why did you want to come here?
-Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

1:02:29.412 --> 1:02:30.955
We finished all the preparations.

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:33.249
He said he would tell me about my mom.

1:02:35.209 --> 1:02:36.794
<i>It's time to return home.</i>

1:02:38.045 --> 1:02:41.424
<i>It could help me find out
where my aunt could be right now.</i>

1:02:42.175 --> 1:02:43.426
<i>Do you really believe</i>

1:02:43.509 --> 1:02:46.179
<i>that this is worth
sacrificing your life for?</i>

1:02:46.262 --> 1:02:47.930
<i>So Jo Kyung-ho</i>

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:50.099
<i>has always wanted me to realize it.</i>

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:52.727
<i>I keep seeing your demise.</i>

1:02:55.104 --> 1:03:00.109
