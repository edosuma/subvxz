00:08.009 --> 00:10.442
(ghostly breathing)

00:15.082 --> 00:17.750
(water bubbling)

00:21.522 --> 00:24.256
(loon calling)

00:29.196 --> 00:31.797
(ominous music)

01:01.462 --> 01:03.062
- I don't want to scare anyone

01:03.064 --> 01:06.765
but, I'm gonna give it to
you straight about Bigfoot.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.103
The locals will tell you
that he lives out here.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.172
Some kind of demented creature.

01:13.808 --> 01:18.210
Stalking, living off of
wild game and vegetation.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.213
Some claim they've even seen
him,

01:22.450 --> 01:24.216
right here in this area.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.619
Bigfoot's out there.

01:28.756 --> 01:29.688
Waiting.

01:29.690 --> 01:33.492
Always on the hunt for
intruders.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.762
Looking to kill, to devour.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.533
Thirsty for blood.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.237
- Aah!
(dramatic music)

01:45.239 --> 01:47.539
(giggling)

01:47.541 --> 01:49.675
- Okay everyone, try to
get some sleep tonight,

01:49.677 --> 01:51.743
we've got a big climb tomorrow.

01:51.745 --> 01:52.878
We're on the trail at 4.30,

01:52.880 --> 01:56.348
so, try not to get too shitty
tonight.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.583
Especially you Sam.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.185
(Sam scoffs)

02:04.825 --> 02:07.593
- Perfect place, perfect time.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.829
- Doesn't get much better than
that.

02:10.831 --> 02:11.763
- Mm mm.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.633
We'll be needing this.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.636
(foreboding music)

02:21.542 --> 02:24.409
(girl chuckling)

02:32.720 --> 02:33.652
- Hey.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.787
Hmm?

02:36.724 --> 02:37.623
- No.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.297
- Double-fisting again.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.380
(leaves crunching)

03:04.185 --> 03:07.219
(girl gasping)

03:07.221 --> 03:07.953
- Oh yeah.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.725
- Bow chicka-wow-wow.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.397
(moaning)

03:23.404 --> 03:26.471
(suspenseful music)

03:36.550 --> 03:39.484
(woman screaming)

03:40.354 --> 03:42.688
- That sounded like Alex.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.589
- They're just messing with us.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.024
Come here.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.458
- No, you need to go check that
out.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.560
- It's cold out there.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.762
- It can get cold in here.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.832
- Gotcha.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.340
All right babe, I'll be right
back.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.711
(moaning)

04:07.581 --> 04:08.914
- Oh Steve.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.449
- It's Chris.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.383
- Whatever.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.719
- Who's Steve.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.254
- [Woman] Mm, shh.

04:15.256 --> 04:15.988
- Nick!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.393
Nick!

04:21.395 --> 04:23.862
(bushes rustling)

04:23.864 --> 04:25.397
(heavy breathing)

04:25.399 --> 04:27.466
This isn't funny.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.402
(bushes rustling)

04:32.539 --> 04:33.405
(dramatic music)

04:33.407 --> 04:34.906
(woman shrieking)

04:34.908 --> 04:37.709
(woman yelling)

04:50.524 --> 04:51.456
- Oh yeah.

04:56.430 --> 04:59.331
(woman screaming)

04:59.333 --> 05:00.532
Oh please God!

05:01.368 --> 05:03.702
(screaming)

05:05.039 --> 05:08.774
(intense unsettling music)

05:12.446 --> 05:14.446

breaking news in the story

Leading to speculation

circumstances surrounding this
incident.

we're officially suspending
our search efforts.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.509
- [Announcer] This just
in, exclusive drone footage

06:17.511 --> 06:19.644
that sheds new light on this
tragedy

06:19.646 --> 06:23.582
revealing grisly details about
the group's final moments.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.751
Warning, this footage is graphic

and may be disturbing to some

Massacre.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.106
- [Female Reporter]
Mountaineering Massacre.

Let's go the phone lines, caller
one,

07:07.828 --> 07:10.061
what do you think about these
idiots?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.897
- [Man] No respect for the land.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.466
They got what was coming to 'em.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.003
(bell rings)

07:21.442 --> 07:22.474
- [Director] And we're out.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.943
Back in two people, thank you.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.716
- Sir, excuse me.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.585
Excuse me sir.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.519
Sir.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.924
- I'm busy Paxton.

07:38.926 --> 07:39.858
What do you want?

07:39.860 --> 07:43.462
- Your network's been
getting a lot of play

07:43.464 --> 07:45.163
on that bear attack clip, right?

07:45.999 --> 07:50.001
I got a guy who says he can
prove no way it was a bear.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.637
Here's the twist.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.674
I want to make a show proving
the existence of Bigfoot.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.545
- Are you really this desperate?

08:00.547 --> 08:03.181
- Every hoax that hits
the news plays for weeks.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.200
People are still watching

08:05.201 --> 08:07.218
that grainy 16 millimeter
footage from 1967.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.920
People love this stuff.

08:10.757 --> 08:15.527
Roger, there is an opportunity
for a show.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.513
- Who cares?

08:18.514 --> 08:20.831
I got 17 reality shows run
by fresh, young producers.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.235
- I still got some tricks
and you have more than enough

08:23.237 --> 08:26.705
so I want to dance with
the millionaire schlock.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.206
- They're cheap and the pigs
will eat

08:28.208 --> 08:30.108
whatever you put in the trough.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.042
Move.

08:31.044 --> 08:35.881
- I want to take a crew up
there and investigate the area.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.516
I've got some ideas.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.552
I can give you a hit show.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.221
I promise.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.592
- I want more than a hit show.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.628
I want proof.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.634
- Deal.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.236
- Rick.

09:01.542 --> 09:02.274
This is it.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.151
- [Ellen] How was your trip?

09:13.153 --> 09:15.654
- The whole area is a swamp.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.088
I'm never going back there.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.691
What do you think?

09:19.693 --> 09:20.909
- Well the wound looks better.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.126
I'm just worried about
infection.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.629
- Ah, he'll be fine.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.067
He's so much sweeter than that
last one.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.035
Elijah?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.570
- Oh my!

09:31.572 --> 09:33.772
- Killer, right out of the
crate.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.206
- Well let's just be certain.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.809
Overnight a seven day dose
pack of doxycycline.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.645
- We can't.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.714
Haskins RX called again this
morning.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.117
They won't deliver anything
else until we're current.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.752
- [Ellen] Just use my card.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.620
- [Wilma] Ellen.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.622
- Please, just do it.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.794
Hi there.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.062
Hi.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.330
- [Woman On Intercom] Dr. Ellen,

09:58.332 --> 10:01.066
there's a Mr. Paxton in your
office.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.000
- Who?

10:09.242 --> 10:11.042
- Excuse, can I help you?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.111
- Dr. Freese?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.212
- Yeah, who are you?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.182
- What do you think this is?

10:17.184 --> 10:19.384
(ominous music)

10:19.386 --> 10:20.885
- A bear.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.121
- Right there, the toes.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.189
Where are the claws?

10:29.396 --> 10:30.595
- I have no idea.

10:30.596 --> 10:31.795
- Well it's pretty
obvious it's not a bear.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.667
- What would you like me to say
exactly?

10:35.669 --> 10:40.105
- What are the odds that this
is an undiscovered species?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.810
- I don't have time for this.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.949
- Extra funding would go
a long way around here

10:50.951 --> 10:51.816
don't you think?

10:51.818 --> 10:52.984
- Who are you?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.469
- My name is Rick Paxton.

10:54.470 --> 10:55.953
I'm putting together a team to
investigate

10:55.956 --> 10:57.422
what could be out there.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.092
I need a primate specialist,
I'd like you to join us.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.228
(Ellen laughs)

11:03.230 --> 11:04.162
$10,000.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.965
For one week of your time.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.938
I'll be in touch.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.261
(Ellen sighs)

11:40.200 --> 11:42.033
- What was that all about?

11:42.035 --> 11:46.438
- He wants me to help him find
Bigfoot.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.341
He said $10,000 for a week.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.011
- When do you leave?

11:54.347 --> 11:55.947
- It's Bigfoot.

11:55.949 --> 11:56.981
- So what?

11:56.983 --> 12:00.118
Spend a week running around the
woods.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.753
That's a lot of money.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.022
Ellen,

12:05.726 --> 12:08.026
You could really use a
break from all of this.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.498
(cellphone ringing)

12:13.500 --> 12:14.432
Sorry.

12:15.469 --> 12:18.002
We've got the grandkids for the
weekend.

12:18.004 --> 12:18.970
- [Kid On Phone] Hi Grandma.

12:18.972 --> 12:19.904
- Hi sweetie.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.973
(mumbling on phone)

12:21.975 --> 12:23.108
You're watching what?

12:24.478 --> 12:25.343
Oh.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.146
(pensive music)

12:37.390 --> 12:38.456
- Did you get the quote?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.391
How much?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.259
(children laughing)

12:41.261 --> 12:42.193
Jesus.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.164
No, I have to have a helicopter.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.400
Because you can't drive up
there.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.888
Yeah, fine.

12:52.889 --> 12:54.272
But I'm not gonna pay him his
full rate

12:54.274 --> 12:56.174
just to sit around and wait for
us.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.442
I don't care, I...

13:01.181 --> 13:02.914
I don't care, just get it done.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.482
Hi.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.286
Where can I find this girl's
father?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.834
Cooper Barnes?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.202
- Who's asking?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.537
- Rick Paxton.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.005
- Another reporter?

13:27.006 --> 13:28.472
I thought I was done with all
y'all.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.074
- No.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.075
I'm not a reporter--

13:31.077 --> 13:34.012
(horse whinnying)

13:35.048 --> 13:36.214
- [Cooper] Easy Betsy.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.383
- I've got a job for you.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.086
I'm a TV producer, putting a
team together

13:42.088 --> 13:44.088
to investigate what happened up
there.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.058
I don't believe it was a bear.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.061
- I'm busy.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.047
- Yeah, I heard.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.032
Heard you been searching these
hills.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.936
I need someone who knows these
mountains.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.374
Look, I'm sorry about what
happened to your daughter.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.310
Alex Barnes, right?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.045
The missing girl.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.514
(emotional music)

14:09.516 --> 14:10.949
As long as you're looking for a
body

14:10.951 --> 14:12.884
you might as well get paid.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.219
Whoa, easy.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.854
Easy cowboy.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.622
I didn't mean it like that.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.624
I'm just trying to help.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.028
2,500 bucks for one week.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.905
We could use you

14:35.075 --> 14:37.175
and we could help you find your
daughter.

14:47.888 --> 14:52.323
Dr. Freese, so glad you could
join us.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.026
All right quickly,
introductions.

14:56.897 --> 15:00.231
This is Dr. Ellen Freese,
she's our primate specialist.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.468
That's Peter Moore,
renowned cryptozoologist.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.237
And this is Justin, he's our
camera man.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.105
- Hello.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.190
I can take that from ya.

15:08.191 --> 15:09.274
- Over by the helicopter is Mr.
Singer,

15:09.276 --> 15:10.575
he's on loan as security.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.645
- Um.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.146
- Just to make sure we're all
safe.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.181
My assistant Danny Kent
and our guide Peter Barnes

15:17.183 --> 15:19.400
are already at the location

15:19.401 --> 15:21.618
and our final member
should be here shortly.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.222
Justin, everything ready to go?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.307
- Almost.

15:25.308 --> 15:26.391
Just got to check a couple more
cases.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.226
- All right, well get it done.

15:28.228 --> 15:30.328
- So she's on the radio, she
says,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.163
"There's a fog bank rolling in."

15:32.165 --> 15:33.364
- Desert Storm.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.999
Six months in that sand pit.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.135
You?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.603
- Yeah, I've seen some action.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.973
- 'Nam?

15:41.975 --> 15:45.176
(dog barking)

15:45.178 --> 15:47.712
Yeah, I know Ike, it's okay.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.048
- He looks up, know what he
says?

15:50.684 --> 15:53.051
"There ain't no fog bank out
there."

15:53.053 --> 15:55.320
He looks again, he says,

15:55.322 --> 15:58.222
"Hey, there's a fog bank out
there."

15:58.224 --> 16:00.992
(laughing) It's a classic scene.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.263
- So what are you doing
here with these civvies.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.566
- Baby sitting.
(Jonesy chuckles)

16:10.704 --> 16:12.503
And that's the baby.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.606
(intense music)

16:15.608 --> 16:18.343
- Oh hell no!

17:29.682 --> 17:32.083
- Everybody this is
Cooper Barnes our guide,

17:32.085 --> 17:33.418
that's my assistant Danny.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.454
- Oh!

17:37.457 --> 17:39.090
(Rick whispering)

17:39.092 --> 17:41.692
- Yeah, everything's good to go.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.796
- Bridgette Powers, journalist.

17:45.765 --> 17:46.697
- We've met.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.368
Enjoy the flight?

17:50.370 --> 17:51.569
- And the flight service.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.213
- Stay with the helicopter.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.649
If I need anything,
I'll call the sat phone.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.583
- We'll be here.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.254
Ah, it looks like it's you and
me Ike.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.458
Go catch us some dinner.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.761
(dog whining)

18:21.234 --> 18:24.302
(slow, moody music)

18:36.216 --> 18:37.782
- [Rick] Yeah, this is a good
spot.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.818
Justin, you point that way.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.353
- [Justin] Okay.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.556
- [Rick] Mr. Moore, right there.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.491
Bridgette.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.829
- Mr. Moore, how long
have you been doing this?

18:51.831 --> 18:54.699
- Since 1974.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.869
I was a farmer in Northern
California.

18:57.871 --> 19:01.439
One night, I was in the
barn feeding the horses

19:01.441 --> 19:04.442
and I smelled something
horrible.

19:04.444 --> 19:09.180
It was like skunk mixed with wet
dog.

19:09.182 --> 19:14.252
The horses went crazy, and then
I saw...it.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.456
It was dark out but I
could tell it was huge,

19:18.458 --> 19:20.358
at least seven feet.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.227
It looked at me and grunted.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.831
Then it went off into the trees.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.467
And I've been studying
sasquatch ever since.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.570
- Anything else?

19:32.572 --> 19:33.671
- No, no, no.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.605
That's enough.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.573
Let's keep moving.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.279
- [Cooper] Oh ma'am.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.556
- Shouldn't you be leading.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.108
- Just follow them.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.659
Didn't they teach you
anything in the army?

19:55.628 --> 19:56.561
- Marines.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.497
- Oorah.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.567
(slow, moody music)

20:21.287 --> 20:22.820
- [Ellen] Is that our campsite?

20:22.822 --> 20:25.456
- [Cooper] No, about an hour
away.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.225
- [Ellen] People live
out here, so the roads--

20:27.227 --> 20:30.528
- [Cooper] No, they'd be logging
roads.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.863
Those cabins are just
for huntin' and fishin'.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.551
- [Bridgette] Goddammit!

20:36.552 --> 20:38.502
You said that I could post
updates, I have followers.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.473
- Yeah, we're almost there.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.376
Oh she's doing fine.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.580
Yes Roger, your son is a lucky
man.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.452
- Water.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.386
- Oh, thank you.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.924
- Yeah, yeah you'll get it, I
promise.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.719
- It happened here.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.954
It happened here!

21:29.956 --> 21:32.490
The massacre it happened--
- Hey!

21:32.492 --> 21:33.457
Watch your mouth.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.463
- Sorry.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.679
- Ah, there you are.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.450
Took longer than I thought.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.085
- I'm sorry, but the
brochure didn't say anything

22:01.087 --> 22:02.953
about a 10 mile nature hike.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.656
- Did you test everything?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.058
- Yup.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.459
Soon as Mr. Moore selects the
hotspots

22:08.461 --> 22:11.028
for the rest of the trail
cameras we'll get those set up.

22:11.030 --> 22:11.962
- We're losing the
light, let's get on this.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.564
- [Danny] All right.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.432
- [Justin] I'll tag along.

22:14.434 --> 22:15.366
- [Danny] Cool.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.370
- We use a natural fiber rope.

22:19.372 --> 22:22.373
Animals tend to avoid man-made
objects.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.042
- Yeah, that explains the bird
house.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.012
- Many think that's why it's so
difficult

22:28.014 --> 22:29.780
to get a picture of a Sasquatch.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.550
Tracking device.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.019
When something takes the bait,

22:35.021 --> 22:37.688
we'll be able to monitor
it back at the base camp.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.560
- Where do you want the
pheromones?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.595
- [Justin] Phero what?

22:44.596 --> 22:46.629
- It's a scent that animals
use for attracting mates.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.133
- Ah, sasquatch Spanish fly.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.135
- [Peter] Yeah, pour it on the
meat.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.436
Just a drop or two.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.573
Splendid.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.409
(suspenseful music)

22:58.411 --> 22:59.143
Let's go.

23:24.437 --> 23:25.603
- We good to go?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.138
- Uh yes.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.940
We've covered some areas of
heavy travel.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.776
One is down by the stream

23:31.778 --> 23:33.043
and the other one is facing a
game trail.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.178
- Rick what's the plan tonight?

23:34.180 --> 23:35.646
Am I working or not?

23:35.648 --> 23:37.748
- We're staying at the base camp
tonight.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.050
Peter's gonna do some call
blasting,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.753
see if he can draw something
close in.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.805
- Call blasting?

23:44.806 --> 23:46.856
- Yes, I want to take these
strategically placed speakers

23:46.859 --> 23:49.794
and play some various animal
sounds.

23:49.796 --> 23:53.164
If there is something out
there, we should get a response.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.167
- And in the morning, we'll
look for evidence of activity.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.803
- Ah yes, the evidence.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.504
- Evidence?

24:00.506 --> 24:03.007
What evidence, Cheech?

24:06.446 --> 24:08.813
- The evidence of this
undiscovered primate

24:08.815 --> 24:10.548
can come in many forms.

24:10.550 --> 24:14.685
Of course there's footprints.
Those are fragile,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.020
watch where you walk.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.826
Often there is a strong
skunk-like odor

24:21.828 --> 24:25.930
and sometimes tree-breaking
has been reported.

24:25.932 --> 24:30.868
They bend trees and branches
to mark their territory.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.837
- Bent branches in the forest.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.973
How are we possibly
gonna find some of those?

24:35.975 --> 24:41.045
- And, if you see a pair
of red eyes in the darkness

24:42.181 --> 24:43.881
staring at you,

24:46.519 --> 24:48.752
it may be too late.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.256
(Spooky laughing)

24:55.194 --> 24:58.062
(animal howling)

25:08.741 --> 25:10.941
- It's one a.m. on night one.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.911
Peter Moore is attempting
communication by call blasting

25:13.913 --> 25:16.247
various animal vocalizations.

25:16.249 --> 25:19.550
As of now, we've had no
response.

25:19.552 --> 25:20.284
Okay cut.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.585
How do I look?

25:21.587 --> 25:22.253
- Fabulous.

25:22.255 --> 25:23.187
- Yeah, obviously.

25:28.261 --> 25:31.195
(animals howling)

25:42.775 --> 25:44.675
- That sounds like a mountain
gorilla.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.843
What is it?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.545
- This particular one was
recorded

25:47.547 --> 25:51.015
during a Bigfoot expedition in
1997.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.851
It was analyzed at the
University of Minnesota

25:53.853 --> 25:57.555
and it didn't match any known
species in the database.

25:57.557 --> 26:00.190
- Well it's definitely a
primate of some kind I'm su...

26:01.894 --> 26:02.927
- Oh, cut it Justin.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.996
(disquieting music)

26:09.235 --> 26:11.335
Well, that was exciting.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.806
- This isn't quite as
glamorous as I was expecting.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.075
- No.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.779
- I think I'm gonna turn in.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.582
Are you okay?

26:42.635 --> 26:45.703
(Bridgette sighing)

26:47.006 --> 26:51.141
(Peter imitating animal howling)

26:54.814 --> 26:56.313
- [Justin] I think we have
enough of this.

26:56.315 --> 26:57.314
- [Danny] More than enough.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.617
Get some sleep.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.652
Nice work.

27:08.861 --> 27:12.029
I think we're gonna need
to try something else.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.099
(disquieting music)

27:24.944 --> 27:27.745
(Peter humming)

27:47.266 --> 27:50.901
- There you are you little
thing.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.772
You're not supposed to
be chewing on my nuts.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.813
(Peter humming)

28:16.295 --> 28:18.962
(owl hooting)

28:22.435 --> 28:25.703
(low ominous music)

28:28.808 --> 28:31.709
(Peter humming)

28:31.711 --> 28:34.445
(leaves rustling)

28:41.253 --> 28:44.121
(dramatic music)

28:55.234 --> 28:56.400
- Breakfast is almost ready.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.334
- Thanks.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.210
- Whoo!

29:09.248 --> 29:11.148
- All right, wake up everybody
else.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.082
- I'll get 'em.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.352
Sleeping beauty.

29:15.354 --> 29:16.253
Hey, sleeping beauty.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.888
Oh!

29:17.890 --> 29:20.224
Mm, copy that.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.158
All right.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.863
(disquieting music)

29:26.532 --> 29:27.464
Where's Peter?

29:28.467 --> 29:29.399
- Who?

29:30.269 --> 29:31.135
- Peter Moore.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.236
- Our cryptozoologist.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.105
- Your bunk mate.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.774
- Never saw him.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.442
I don't even think he slept in
the tent.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.110
- Where you planning to
say something about that?

29:41.547 --> 29:44.181
- I just figured the hippie
was off smoking dope.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.253
- All right.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.923
Has anybody seen Peter Moore
this morning?

29:52.925 --> 29:55.225
- The last time I saw him was
last night.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.294
He was gonna check on the trail
cameras.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.297
- Sounds like a good place to
start.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.231
- On it.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.520
(deep animal growling)

30:28.494 --> 30:30.494
Some misfires.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.895
Some animals.

30:33.098 --> 30:34.598
And then there's this.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.904
- Dr. Freese.

30:40.906 --> 30:43.006
Could you come in here and
take a look at this please.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.409
- Any sign of Peter?

30:46.245 --> 30:47.344
- Just this.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.918
- What do you think?

30:54.920 --> 30:56.220
- About that?

30:56.222 --> 30:57.221
I don't know.

30:57.223 --> 31:00.490
A big dark, hairy...

31:01.894 --> 31:03.126
- Barnes?

31:03.128 --> 31:05.262
- Looks like a bear.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.997
Or an old man in a gorilla suit.

31:21.447 --> 31:22.512
- Come here.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.116
Are you ready?

31:26.118 --> 31:27.050
Okay.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.021
It's around 9.30 a.m. on day
two.

31:31.023 --> 31:34.291
Peter Moore, our cryptozoologist
has gone missing.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.976
- Peter is missing.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.660
Who cares about that
blur, we need to find him.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.996
- Wait.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.599
What blur?

31:41.600 --> 31:44.201
- For all we know he's fine
and sleeping off a long night.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.502
- What blur?

31:45.504 --> 31:46.436
- Cheech.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.139
He got himself lost.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.541
- Maybe.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.942
All the more reason to go
looking for him.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.111
- What goddamn blur?

31:54.113 --> 31:56.013
- Look we aren't scheduled for
anything until dark, right?

31:56.015 --> 31:58.015
- We have to review the footage.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.483
But you're fine till later.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.417
- Great.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.089
- I don't know why
everyone's getting so excited

32:06.091 --> 32:08.091
about some hairy blob.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.393
This is very exciting!

32:09.395 --> 32:12.329
We just found our first
piece of hard evidence.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.197
A trail camera has captured an
image

32:14.199 --> 32:16.133
of a Bigfoot in the wild.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.252
Whether or not this has anything
to do

32:18.253 --> 32:20.370
with our missing team
member is only speculation.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.973
All we can do now is hope and
pray,

32:22.975 --> 32:24.408
that we find him still alive.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.343
Okay, I'm done.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.478
- Is anyone coming?

32:29.515 --> 32:30.480
- Pass.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.415
- Great.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.355
[Ellen calling out] Peter!

32:42.494 --> 32:43.427
[Ellen calling out] Peter!

32:49.335 --> 32:50.267
Peter!

32:51.437 --> 32:52.369
- [Cooper] Hey!

32:53.572 --> 32:56.373
(ominous music)

32:58.243 --> 32:59.643
- [Ellen] Barnes...

33:01.013 --> 33:02.646
- The rain didn't help this
morning.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.415
But I can definitely see a
struggle here.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.283
(radio static)

33:06.285 --> 33:07.317
- Justin for base camp.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.494
- Tracks go here.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.031
That's his blood.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.234
- Peter!
- Shh.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.572
It's fresh.

33:42.721 --> 33:43.653
- What is it?

33:47.159 --> 33:48.225
- It's dragging him.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.628
It's not letting go.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.340
- Y'all are serious?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.408
We're gonna?

34:05.411 --> 34:06.343
Okay.

34:11.050 --> 34:14.117
(suspenseful music)

34:53.092 --> 34:54.491
- [Ellen] Barnes...

35:05.137 --> 35:06.736
- This is fucked up.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.410
No!

35:14.446 --> 35:16.113
This is fucked up!

35:18.851 --> 35:20.317
- [Ellen] What?

35:20.319 --> 35:21.451
What is that?

35:22.554 --> 35:24.488
- [Cooper] Intestines.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.159
- [Justin] Justin for base camp.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.894
- [Rick On Radio] Go for base
camp.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.462
- Uh.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.647
We found something.

35:33.648 --> 35:34.831
- [Rick On Radio] Is it Moore?

35:36.335 --> 35:37.267
- I hope not.

35:39.204 --> 35:43.773
We're in a mine and there are
intestines

35:44.610 --> 35:46.409
hanging from the ceiling.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.544
- [Rick On Radio] Did you film
it?

35:49.448 --> 35:50.480
- (sighs) On it.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.289
- [Cooper] Those are fresh.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.290
- Yeah.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.558
Looks like sausage right?

36:07.299 --> 36:08.231
- Oh!

36:16.208 --> 36:16.940
Barnes.

36:17.943 --> 36:19.342
- Thanks for the jokes.

36:21.246 --> 36:22.579
- (sighs) Great.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.184
Justin, I have the perfect
summer job for you...

36:27.953 --> 36:30.353
You're a camera guy, it's gonna
be great.

36:43.368 --> 36:44.301
- How?

36:46.738 --> 36:49.606
(Ellen coughing)

37:00.786 --> 37:01.718
- We should go.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.927
- No, no, nothing yet.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.363
Roger let me call you in the
morning.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.498
Yes, we'll have something solid.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.236
Okay two teams.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.938
Dr. Freese, Danny, you're with
Barnes.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.307
Head back to where you were
earlier today.

37:24.309 --> 37:28.612
Singer, you've got Bridgette
and Justin, go south.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.980
I'm gonna stay here and monitor

37:29.982 --> 37:31.915
and I want regular updates.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.485
Regular updates.

37:37.522 --> 37:38.455
- Bear spray.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.491
- That shit don't work.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.629
- My bad.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.430
I forgot about your invisible
force field.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.466
- [Rick] Let's go.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.810
(disquieting music)

38:04.016 --> 38:06.549
- It's just before 10 p.m. on
night two.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.018
With no luck at our base camp
last night.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.920
We're now actively
searching the dense forest.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.722
Our guide is using a FLIR
camera.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.592
(grunts) Fucking forest.

38:17.296 --> 38:20.930
Which stands for Forward-Looking
Infra-Red.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.532
It senses heat and anything
living

38:22.534 --> 38:24.534
will come up bright red on the
screen.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.843
- [Danny On Radio] Danny For
base camp.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.780
- Go for base camp.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.448
- [Danny On Radio] We found
something.

38:38.450 --> 38:40.083
(ominous music)

38:40.085 --> 38:42.369
- What is it?

38:42.370 --> 38:44.654
- [Danny On Radio] A whole
bunch of logs and branches.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.526
- Danny, why are you calling
me about a bunch of sticks?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.330
- Well because it looks like it
was done

38:53.332 --> 38:55.031
to block the path.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.034
- All right, get some
B-roll, get plenty of footage

38:58.036 --> 39:01.371
and we'll cut it with what
Peter was talking about earlier.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.772
- [Danny On Radio] Copy that.

39:02.774 --> 39:03.840
- What do you think?

39:13.785 --> 39:16.553
(exhaling loudly)

39:16.555 --> 39:18.488
- [Rick On Radio] Justin,
anything to report?

39:19.091 --> 39:21.258
- Nope.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.426
We are wrapping up a technical
difficulty.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.698
- Tell her to put it out and
get her skinny ass in gear.

39:29.835 --> 39:30.900
- You heard the man.

39:37.943 --> 39:43.113
(exhaling loudly)
(grunting)

39:43.115 --> 39:44.647
- What was that?

39:48.987 --> 39:51.588
(sighing)

39:51.590 --> 39:53.022
- See that?

39:53.024 --> 39:53.990
- What is it?

40:00.465 --> 40:02.766
- Got something on the FLIR.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.900
Following it now.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.773
- Out there, past those trees.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.776
I see you.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.744
[Bridgette] Ugh, this is
bullshit man.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.414
I should be in a glossy studio
right now.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.550
Jesus Christ, where are we
going?

40:20.552 --> 40:21.418
- [Justin] Shh.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.654
- Both of you, wait here.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.922
And goddamn it, be quiet.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.729
Fuckin' civvies.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.040
Nice work.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.009
(Bridgette sighs)

40:46.011 --> 40:47.477
You scared off your story.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.914
- Too bad the real tracker
wasn't with us.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.782
Did you learn anything in the
army?

40:55.754 --> 40:57.020
- Thank you.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.588
Justin for base camp.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.824
- [Rick On Radio] Go for base
camp.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.059
- Well, we saw a couple
of things on the FLIR

41:03.061 --> 41:04.861
but we lost whatever it was.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.130
- [Rick On Radio] Okay.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.065
Everyone come on back.

41:09.067 --> 41:09.966
- Copy that.

41:16.741 --> 41:17.674
Where are we?

41:20.846 --> 41:23.880
(Bridgette sighing)

41:32.023 --> 41:34.591
- You guys took your good sweet
time.

41:34.593 --> 41:36.092
- We got lost.

41:37.229 --> 41:38.862
- What happened?

41:38.864 --> 41:39.896
- Well we saw something.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.098
So we followed it for a bit.

41:42.100 --> 41:45.835
Singer had it for a
moment, but we lost it.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.137
- What did it look like?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.176
-[Danny] Guys come take a look
at this.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.718
Give me a second.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.188
That's the first one.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.689
Now hang on.

42:09.728 --> 42:10.860
This is the best one.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.231
- It's walking upright.

42:16.868 --> 42:20.803
- You are gonna need a bigger
banana.

42:30.282 --> 42:32.181
- Barnes, something is going on.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.367
- Yeah, something is going on.

42:34.368 --> 42:36.552
Haven't you noticed Peter
is missing and nobody cares.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.655
(banging in the woods)

42:38.657 --> 42:40.323
- [Ellen] What the hell?

42:40.325 --> 42:43.026
- All right people, saddLe up.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.094
It's time to earn your pay
checks.

42:56.908 --> 42:57.907
- Miss Powers.

42:59.311 --> 43:02.178
I know you're tired, your feet
hurt.

43:03.915 --> 43:08.985
But if you could find the time,
put your fucking boots on!

43:18.029 --> 43:20.863
I put this on Powers' coat.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.233
- You sure that's a good idea?

43:25.937 --> 43:26.869
- Fuck it.

43:31.776 --> 43:35.244
(sticks banging in woods)

43:36.982 --> 43:39.048
- I think it's up there.

43:47.225 --> 43:48.224
- Oh Jesus.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.327
Hey, where's Bridgette?

43:53.098 --> 43:54.030
- Ugh.

43:57.068 --> 44:00.136
(suspenseful music)

44:08.079 --> 44:09.078
Oh, dammit!

44:14.185 --> 44:15.118
Perfect.

44:21.826 --> 44:24.093
(beast growling)

44:29.734 --> 44:30.667
Hello?

44:34.372 --> 44:35.238
(leaves rustling)

44:35.240 --> 44:36.172
Justin?

44:43.915 --> 44:44.781
(beast growling)

44:44.783 --> 44:45.715
Danny?

44:49.754 --> 44:53.956
(beast roaring)
(Bridgette screaming)

44:53.958 --> 44:54.824
- [Justin] Oh!

44:54.826 --> 44:55.842
- [Ellen] Oh my god.

44:55.843 --> 44:56.859
- No it's okay, it's okay just
go.

44:56.861 --> 44:57.794
Just go!

44:58.463 --> 45:00.763
(low growling)

45:00.765 --> 45:01.964
What was that?

45:01.966 --> 45:05.168
(Bridgette screaming)

45:11.443 --> 45:12.308
- Do you see anything?

45:12.310 --> 45:14.077
- I don't see anything.

45:15.013 --> 45:15.945
- Dammit!

45:17.782 --> 45:19.182
(beast growling)

45:19.184 --> 45:20.116
This way.

45:22.854 --> 45:23.953
Bridgette!

45:23.955 --> 45:25.388
- [Danny] Bridgette!

45:25.390 --> 45:26.322
Bridgette!

45:27.959 --> 45:29.492
- [John] Bridgette!

45:36.134 --> 45:37.266
- [Cooper] No, no, no.

45:40.905 --> 45:41.904
- [Cooper] She's all right.

45:41.906 --> 45:43.906
(Bridgette shrieking)

45:43.907 --> 45:45.907
- Whoa, it's all right.
- It's all right.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.443
- Whoa!
- We gotcha.

45:48.847 --> 45:50.913
- [Danny] It's all right.

45:52.383 --> 45:54.317
Breathe, just breathe.

45:54.319 --> 45:55.384
Don't look.

45:56.221 --> 45:57.086
- It's a compound fracture.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.287
- No shit.

45:58.289 --> 45:59.155
- Just try to relax.

45:59.157 --> 46:00.890
Can you feel your foot.

46:00.892 --> 46:01.958
- We have to get out of here.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.427
We have to get out of here right
now.

46:04.429 --> 46:05.928
- Barnes, get me two sticks--

46:05.930 --> 46:07.997
- No, there's no time, there's
no time!

46:07.999 --> 46:09.165
We have to leave right now.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.266
Thank you.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.134
- Calm down.
- What are you doing?

46:11.136 --> 46:12.135
What are you doing?

46:12.137 --> 46:14.904
Wha, no, no!
- It's gonna be just--

46:14.906 --> 46:16.906
(bone cracking)
(Bridgette screaming)

46:16.908 --> 46:17.840
Fine.

46:17.842 --> 46:21.878
Okay, thank you.
- Danny to base camp.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.148
Base camp, come in.

46:28.153 --> 46:29.886
[Danny on Radio] Base camp,
where are you?

46:33.792 --> 46:35.124
Dammit.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.058
- [Ellen] Danny?

46:37.495 --> 46:39.729
- I think we just.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.964
Let's figure out how to
get her back to base camp.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.299
(Ellen mumbling)

46:43.301 --> 46:44.233
- Okay.

46:55.380 --> 46:58.114
- [John] All right, I got her.

46:58.116 --> 46:59.048
Let's go.

47:03.188 --> 47:06.122
(distant roaring)

47:11.563 --> 47:14.230
- [Ellen] See if you can
find me a full medical kit.

47:14.232 --> 47:15.364
- [John] There's one in the
other tent.

47:15.366 --> 47:16.833
- [Ellen] Okay.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.536
- What the hell you doing in my
tent?

47:20.538 --> 47:22.104
- Med kit.

47:22.106 --> 47:23.039
- Med?

47:25.910 --> 47:26.976
- Oh thanks.

47:29.447 --> 47:31.013
- Oh shit.

47:31.015 --> 47:31.981
- Welcome back.

47:31.983 --> 47:35.017
- Why didn't you or the jarhead
radio me?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.219
- We did.

47:36.221 --> 47:37.854
Why weren't you on the radio?

47:38.523 --> 47:41.023
- I was checking the cables,
one of the cameras went out.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.059
- And you didn't hear the radio?

47:43.061 --> 47:44.193
- I must have left it in the
tent.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.862
What happened to her?

47:45.864 --> 47:46.996
- She fell.

47:46.997 --> 47:48.129
Something scared the hell out of
her.

47:48.132 --> 47:49.699
Then we heard some strange
growling

47:49.700 --> 47:51.267
while you were doing whatever
it is you were doing.

47:51.269 --> 47:52.401
- I told you I was...

47:53.271 --> 47:55.004
Wait, what, what growling?

47:55.974 --> 47:58.307
- Oh don't worry, she'll be
fine.

47:58.309 --> 47:59.475
- What growling?

47:59.477 --> 48:01.143
- Hey Danny?
- Hmm.

48:01.145 --> 48:03.613
- You guys come up with a
name for your documentary yet?

48:03.615 --> 48:05.081
- Mr. Paxton hasn't said.

48:06.117 --> 48:08.618
- Well I've been thinking of
some ideas.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.286
- Of course you have.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.355
- "The Blair Foot Project"

48:14.158 --> 48:15.558
"Yeti Does Dallas"

48:15.560 --> 48:16.492
- Aw.

48:17.495 --> 48:18.995
- That's a good one.

48:20.498 --> 48:22.031
- We're not leaving.

48:22.033 --> 48:23.666
Especially now, with all this
activity.

48:23.668 --> 48:26.202
You say they're chasing
something in the woods.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.004
We're not leaving.

48:28.006 --> 48:29.672
- We don't need to leave

48:29.673 --> 48:31.339
but we need to get
Bridgette to a hospital.

48:31.342 --> 48:33.242
- [Rick] Danny can drive
her to the helicopter.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.444
- (scoffs) With a compound
fracture.

48:35.446 --> 48:37.013
Just call Jonesy.

48:37.014 --> 48:38.581
- You know, the helicopter
doesn't have a winch.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.283
Why do you think we hiked in
here?

48:40.285 --> 48:43.252
- Well then I think we need
to call search and rescue.

48:43.254 --> 48:46.222
- Luckily Ellen, you're
not here to make decisions.

48:46.224 --> 48:48.591
- Oh and where did you
get your medical degree?

48:49.527 --> 48:52.628
(Bridgette coughing)

48:53.998 --> 48:56.299
- We have a production to
finish.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.402
And I am not gonna call search
and rescue

48:59.404 --> 49:02.305
and have them scare
away whatever hope it is

49:02.307 --> 49:04.941
we have of shooting tonight.

49:04.943 --> 49:08.344
(Bridgette coughs)

49:08.346 --> 49:09.278
Singer.

49:28.232 --> 49:29.398
Base camp for Danny.

49:31.269 --> 49:32.735
- [Danny] Go for Danny.

49:32.737 --> 49:34.537
- Camera three is down.

49:34.539 --> 49:36.238
Get it fixed.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.173
- Copy that.

49:38.676 --> 49:41.077
Okay guys, you're on your own.

49:41.746 --> 49:43.579
Meet you back at base camp.

49:43.581 --> 49:44.513
- Singer.

49:46.084 --> 49:47.183
Do your job.

49:48.519 --> 49:50.619
- I work for Brannan.

49:50.621 --> 49:52.054
- Danny...

49:52.056 --> 49:53.622
"The Hills Have Fur"

49:55.226 --> 49:56.292
That's the best one.

49:57.362 --> 50:00.196
This guy.

50:00.198 --> 50:03.099
- I don't think that getting a
blow job from Princess Powers

50:03.101 --> 50:04.567
is why Brannan hired you.

50:06.004 --> 50:07.069
Know your place.

50:11.309 --> 50:12.241
We're done.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.443
- You got that right.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.418
(creature growling)

50:28.659 --> 50:32.661
(sticks tapping in the forest)

50:33.731 --> 50:34.663
- After you.

50:37.035 --> 50:37.767
- Yeah.

50:41.739 --> 50:42.772
- [John] How is she?

50:44.542 --> 50:45.608
- She's stable.

50:45.610 --> 50:50.312
We're lucky the bone didn't
nick an artery or a vein, so.

50:58.356 --> 50:59.422
- Listen Doc.

51:03.795 --> 51:05.044
Be careful.

51:05.045 --> 51:06.294
Don't turn your back on that
guy.

51:06.297 --> 51:07.630
You don't know these people.

51:11.135 --> 51:12.068
You want to know the real-

51:12.070 --> 51:15.271
(Bridgette screaming)

51:16.541 --> 51:17.473
- We have to leave!

51:17.475 --> 51:19.275
We have to leave now.

51:19.277 --> 51:20.576
- Bridgette, you're okay.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.111
- I saw it.

51:22.113 --> 51:24.713
It's fucking real and it tried
to kill me.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.549
- [Ellen] Singer.
(Bridgette screaming)

51:26.551 --> 51:28.551
- Let go of me.
- Breathe, breathe!

51:28.553 --> 51:30.119
- Goddamn it let go of me!

51:30.121 --> 51:30.786
- Wait, wait!

51:30.788 --> 51:32.655
Let her talk.

51:32.657 --> 51:33.589
- No!

51:38.696 --> 51:41.263
- What did she see out there?

52:04.589 --> 52:08.390
(beast growling)
(dog yelping)

52:08.392 --> 52:11.160
(metal banging)

52:12.263 --> 52:13.195
- Wha?

52:19.337 --> 52:20.269
Ike?

52:28.579 --> 52:31.413
(sinister music)

52:57.175 --> 52:57.907
Oh, Ike!

53:04.582 --> 53:07.316
(low breathing)

53:08.819 --> 53:09.752
You fuck.

53:14.258 --> 53:16.659
You fucked with the wrong
aviator.

53:21.332 --> 53:24.266
(Jonesy grunting)

53:28.539 --> 53:32.208
(heavy breathing)

53:43.387 --> 53:44.453
- Come here.

53:46.224 --> 53:48.891
(beast growling)

53:53.664 --> 53:55.231
- Barnes.

53:55.233 --> 53:56.749
- Yeah.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.266
- I got to tell you, I'm
not really a fan of this.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.002
(rustling)

54:00.004 --> 54:00.936
- [Cooper] Hear that?

54:00.938 --> 54:02.705
(beast growling)

54:02.707 --> 54:05.741
- We're in the woods, I hear
every...
- Hear that?

54:08.379 --> 54:09.878
(beast growling)

54:09.880 --> 54:12.414
It's coming from over there.

54:15.653 --> 54:18.320
(tense music)

54:20.725 --> 54:22.258
- Where'd it go?

54:24.462 --> 54:27.329
(beast growling)

54:33.471 --> 54:34.870
Did you see that?

54:40.978 --> 54:43.679
Where the fuck is it?

54:43.681 --> 54:45.014
- It's up there.

54:50.688 --> 54:51.620
Shh.

54:53.391 --> 54:54.390
Don't move.

54:54.392 --> 54:55.391
Don't move.

55:01.766 --> 55:04.633
- [Justin] What the fuck is
that?

55:10.808 --> 55:12.941
- Listen, listen, listen!

55:14.845 --> 55:15.778
What the?

55:17.815 --> 55:20.716
MOVE!

55:20.718 --> 55:21.650
- Ah!

55:25.690 --> 55:26.622
You okay?

55:28.559 --> 55:30.759
- [Cooper] Yeah, I'm okay.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.929
- Maybe we can still catch it.

55:34.865 --> 55:37.900
- No, I think I've had enough.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.835
- We still have the IR camera.

55:39.837 --> 55:40.903
Aren't you curious as to what
just threw

55:40.905 --> 55:42.438
a giant boulder at us?

55:44.475 --> 55:46.809
- I got a pretty good idea what
it was.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.478
- Base camp to Danny.

55:51.549 --> 55:53.482
Thought you said you
fixed that trail camera.

55:53.484 --> 55:54.116
It's broken again.

55:54.118 --> 55:55.818
- You're an asshole.

55:55.820 --> 55:58.554
That little stunt of yours
could have got us all killed.

55:58.556 --> 55:59.989
Son of a bitch.

55:59.990 --> 56:01.423
- What the hell you talking
about?

56:01.425 --> 56:02.458
- No.

56:02.460 --> 56:03.392
- Stop it.

56:04.595 --> 56:05.594
Stop your lies.

56:06.731 --> 56:10.566
Six kids died up here

56:10.568 --> 56:12.701
and my daughter was one of those
kids.

56:15.506 --> 56:18.941
And all you care about is a
goddamn TV show about Bigfoot.

56:20.077 --> 56:21.043
- Well it's better than
obsessing

56:21.045 --> 56:23.479
about finding some dead body.

56:23.481 --> 56:24.480
- What you say!

56:24.482 --> 56:25.447
- No!

56:25.449 --> 56:26.515
- What did you say?

56:26.517 --> 56:27.649
- Stop it!

56:27.651 --> 56:28.584
All of you.

56:28.586 --> 56:29.518
Jesus.

56:31.756 --> 56:34.723
(ominous music)

56:34.725 --> 56:36.158
- Holy shit.

56:37.428 --> 56:40.729
- Bridgette is hurt and
Peter is still missing.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.398
We don't have time for this.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.799
- [Danny] Base camp, come in.

56:45.536 --> 56:47.625
- Go.

56:47.626 --> 56:49.715
- [Danny On Radio] Got to see
this.

56:49.716 --> 56:51.805
Camera's destroyed and there's
a footprint, a big one.

56:51.809 --> 56:53.175
- Copy that, I'm on my way.

56:55.946 --> 56:59.548
Everybody keep it together
and do your fuckin' jobs.

56:59.550 --> 57:00.482
Let's go.

57:01.819 --> 57:02.851
- It's that way.

57:07.158 --> 57:08.924
- We'll finish this later
cowboy.

57:10.127 --> 57:11.059
- Rick.

57:12.096 --> 57:13.829
You're an asshole.

57:13.831 --> 57:16.465
- [Rick] Dr. Freese if you don't
mind.

57:16.467 --> 57:17.199
- Fine.

57:20.070 --> 57:21.703
- You know this isn't a hoax.

57:23.007 --> 57:24.606
We didn't stage any of this.

57:25.476 --> 57:26.809
Maybe you'll figure that
out after I come back

57:26.811 --> 57:28.644
with a size 17 footprint.

57:43.627 --> 57:44.660
- [John] Hey Chief.

57:48.766 --> 57:49.898
- Thank you.

57:49.900 --> 57:50.833
- Yeah.

57:52.203 --> 57:53.135
Listen.

57:54.038 --> 57:55.204
We both know these guys

57:55.206 --> 57:58.941
are grade A, number one, alpha
assholes.

58:01.645 --> 58:02.578
- Yup.

58:17.027 --> 58:18.594
- We need a plan.

58:19.630 --> 58:20.562
- Yes we do.

58:27.137 --> 58:30.105
- [Danny] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

58:30.107 --> 58:31.106
- Oh!

58:31.108 --> 58:32.708
Oh wow!

58:33.777 --> 58:35.043
- Look at this.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.146
- Come to daddy.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.551
- [Danny] And then there's this.

58:47.258 --> 58:50.225
(Ellen gasps)

58:50.227 --> 58:51.260
- Well Dr. Freese?

58:52.730 --> 58:54.162
- Danny do you have a
tape measure in there?

58:54.164 --> 58:55.097
- [Danny] Yeah.

59:00.037 --> 59:03.105
- It's 18 and a quarter, heel to
big toe.

59:06.010 --> 59:09.211
Over seven side to side.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.618
The detail is remarkable.

59:16.620 --> 59:19.721
You can see scar tissue, skin.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.057
More hair.

59:24.995 --> 59:26.562
This would be tough to fake.

59:28.198 --> 59:29.965
- Justin, roll footage on this

59:29.967 --> 59:31.133
just in case the mold doesn't
work.

59:31.135 --> 59:33.235
Danny, get a sample of that
hair.

59:34.305 --> 59:38.106
- Uh guys, this is awesome.

59:39.176 --> 59:42.044
(Rick chuckling)

59:45.249 --> 59:48.650
- You're gonna have to do
more testing on the hair

59:48.652 --> 59:51.153
but it certainly looks like the
footprint

59:51.155 --> 59:56.224
of a very large, very real
primate.

1:00:02.032 --> 1:00:06.034
(banging and scraping outside)

1:00:18.949 --> 1:00:19.881
- Oh.

1:00:20.784 --> 1:00:23.919
(sat phone beeping)

1:00:23.921 --> 1:00:26.722
(ominous music)

1:00:27.925 --> 1:00:32.995
- H-h-hello?
(heavy breathing)

1:00:41.805 --> 1:00:46.875
(Bridgette screaming)
(dramatic music)

1:00:48.278 --> 1:00:49.678
- That thing is out there.

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:50.946
It just ran by.

1:00:52.016 --> 1:00:52.948
What?

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:54.683
What?

1:00:54.685 --> 1:00:56.184
- Jesus.

1:00:56.186 --> 1:01:01.356
(Bridgette screaming)
(dramatic music)

1:01:01.358 --> 1:01:02.658
- Okay.

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:04.493
- What's going on?

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:06.327
- It's blood, it's blood,
it's fucking blood.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:10.699
Get this shit off of me.
(screams)

1:01:10.701 --> 1:01:12.868
(Bridgette gasping)
- Okay, okay.

1:01:12.870 --> 1:01:15.137
- Get it off of me.

1:01:15.139 --> 1:01:16.439
- You're okay, you're okay.

1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:17.740
- [Bridgette] Get it off of me.

1:01:17.741 --> 1:01:19.041
- Okay boys, give her some
space.

1:01:19.043 --> 1:01:20.042
Okay, okay.

1:01:22.713 --> 1:01:24.279
- [Bridgette] Get it off me.

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.846
- You're okay, you're okay.

1:01:30.454 --> 1:01:33.121
(tense music)

1:01:37.227 --> 1:01:39.628
Right now all I care
about is getting her safe

1:01:39.629 --> 1:01:42.030
after that we can argue about
whatever it is you want to do.

1:01:42.032 --> 1:01:43.932
- You know trashing the
production tent

1:01:43.934 --> 1:01:45.801
isn't gonna get you
home any sooner, right?

1:01:45.803 --> 1:01:47.102
- Rick just make the call.

1:01:47.104 --> 1:01:48.737
- I can't.

1:01:48.739 --> 1:01:50.238
The sat phone is missing.

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:54.009
- Why the fuck would I
take the phone Paxton?

1:01:54.011 --> 1:01:55.728
- I don't know.

1:01:55.729 --> 1:01:57.446
We're at the footprints and
you're back here, weeping.

1:01:57.448 --> 1:01:59.481
- We still need to get her out
of here.

1:02:01.151 --> 1:02:04.786
- Danny, take the ATV, go
back to the helicopter.

1:02:04.788 --> 1:02:07.222
Use the sat phone to
contact search and rescue.

1:02:07.224 --> 1:02:08.090
You happy?

1:02:08.092 --> 1:02:09.024
- Thank you.

1:02:10.394 --> 1:02:13.061
- Everybody, take a nap.

1:02:13.063 --> 1:02:14.796
Get yourselves together.

1:02:14.798 --> 1:02:16.932
We start shooting again in a
little while.

1:02:45.362 --> 1:02:46.294
- Hey Jonesy.

1:02:47.364 --> 1:02:48.330
Jonesy!

1:02:50.801 --> 1:02:53.135
We need the sat phone,
Bridgette's been hurt.

1:02:57.975 --> 1:02:58.907
Jesus.

1:03:00.043 --> 1:03:02.377
(flies buzzing)
Did you have a late night?

1:03:05.783 --> 1:03:06.848
(ominous music)

1:03:06.850 --> 1:03:07.783
Jonesy?

1:03:29.072 --> 1:03:30.572
- Morning Doc.

1:03:30.574 --> 1:03:32.240
- Hi.

1:03:32.242 --> 1:03:33.909
- [Justin] Morning Dr. Freese.

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:36.444
- Where is everyone?

1:03:36.446 --> 1:03:38.313
- Paxton is still reviewing
footage

1:03:38.315 --> 1:03:41.917
and Bridgette is...out.

1:03:41.919 --> 1:03:43.485
- No sign of Danny?

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:44.853
- Not yet.

1:03:44.855 --> 1:03:45.954
- What about Barnes?

1:03:48.225 --> 1:03:49.825
- He's been gone for a while.

1:03:51.895 --> 1:03:54.963
(disquieting music)

1:04:20.357 --> 1:04:22.290
- [Cooper] Sleep much?

1:04:23.994 --> 1:04:24.960
- Not much.

1:04:28.098 --> 1:04:29.931
I always hated the sight of
blood.

1:04:31.568 --> 1:04:32.601
Med school was fun.

1:04:37.274 --> 1:04:38.206
What's that?

1:04:41.979 --> 1:04:44.479
- I've been thinking about my
grandfather.

1:04:47.451 --> 1:04:49.885
He was a forest ranger
up here for 30 years.

1:04:53.190 --> 1:04:56.892
He was high up in the mountains
one night, by himself.

1:04:56.894 --> 1:05:01.963
A storm came through, so he
went into a cave to wait it out.

1:05:02.532 --> 1:05:04.399
At the back of the cave he
found...

1:05:05.936 --> 1:05:08.236
- A huge pile of bones.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:09.504
- Not just any bones.

1:05:10.574 --> 1:05:14.309
Bears, bobcats, predators.

1:05:14.311 --> 1:05:16.111
Killed and all piled up.

1:05:18.482 --> 1:05:21.283
He said he heard a
noise deeper in the cave

1:05:22.152 --> 1:05:23.919
so he took his flashlight

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:26.521
and he started looking
through the shadows.

1:05:26.523 --> 1:05:31.593
And that's where he saw
red eyes, glowing red eyes.

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:35.597
He said he let out a scream.

1:05:35.599 --> 1:05:40.669
He started running and
that thing chased him

1:05:41.104 --> 1:05:42.170
all the way to town.

1:05:44.074 --> 1:05:46.374
Said he never really felt
the same up here again.

1:05:47.678 --> 1:05:48.610
- And the tag?

1:05:48.612 --> 1:05:53.581
- Well, my grandfather said
when dangerous predators

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:56.718
went into town, the rangers
would tag them and release them.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:06:00.455
If they came back, they'd take
them deeper into the forest,

1:06:01.692 --> 1:06:03.158
always to the same place.

1:06:05.262 --> 1:06:10.332
That cave yesterday, I found
a whole bunch of these.

1:06:11.301 --> 1:06:13.101
- Something's killing the rogue
animals.

1:06:23.981 --> 1:06:28.350
Hey, um, did I hear you
say you had a daughter?

1:06:33.590 --> 1:06:35.223
- Yeah.

1:06:35.225 --> 1:06:36.224
- What's her name?

1:06:38.362 --> 1:06:39.394
- Her name's Alex.

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.606
- Where the hell is he?

1:06:51.608 --> 1:06:53.508
- It takes a while to get here.

1:06:53.510 --> 1:06:55.477
- Nine hours!

1:06:55.479 --> 1:06:57.145
This is bullshit.

1:06:58.281 --> 1:07:00.749
Hey, um, monkey lady.

1:07:01.718 --> 1:07:03.752
The drugs are wearing off, I
need more.

1:07:05.555 --> 1:07:09.057
- I'm sorry, you can't take
anything for another hour.

1:07:09.059 --> 1:07:09.791
- Perfect.

1:07:11.628 --> 1:07:13.628
One hell of a production you got
here.

1:07:14.464 --> 1:07:16.431
Unsafe working conditions.

1:07:16.433 --> 1:07:20.201
Psychotic arts and crafts,
shitty food.

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:21.136
What's next.

1:07:21.138 --> 1:07:22.137
- All right ready.

1:07:23.607 --> 1:07:26.508
- It's 4.30 p.m. on day three.

1:07:26.510 --> 1:07:29.411
Despite several attacks
and severe injuries,

1:07:29.413 --> 1:07:32.180
this journalist is going strong.

1:07:32.182 --> 1:07:35.517
Nothing is going to, holy fuck!

1:07:37.287 --> 1:07:40.155
(Danny grunting)

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:43.558
- [Ellen] Where are you hurt?

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:44.826
- Jonesy's dead.

1:07:44.828 --> 1:07:47.729
Very, very dead.

1:07:47.731 --> 1:07:48.663
- What happened?

1:07:51.168 --> 1:07:52.067
- I saw it.

1:08:15.725 --> 1:08:18.393
(Danny vomiting)

1:08:18.395 --> 1:08:19.911
- He has a concussion.

1:08:19.912 --> 1:08:21.428
We gotta get him inside the mess
tent.

1:08:21.431 --> 1:08:22.564
- [Cooper] Come on Danny.

1:08:27.337 --> 1:08:28.103
- Where's the ATV?

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:33.225
(Danny coughing)

1:08:33.226 --> 1:08:34.209
- Someone get me a flashlight.

1:08:34.211 --> 1:08:35.343
In my backpack.

1:08:36.213 --> 1:08:37.812
- There's no one to fly the
chopper.

1:08:37.814 --> 1:08:40.648
How the hell are we gonna get
out of here?

1:08:40.650 --> 1:08:42.750
- Danny look at the light.

1:08:42.752 --> 1:08:43.685
Look at the light Danny.

1:08:43.687 --> 1:08:45.353
- Danny where's the sat phone?

1:08:46.890 --> 1:08:48.857
Dammit Danny, where's the sat
phone?

1:08:48.859 --> 1:08:50.825
- Didn't you hear me?

1:08:50.827 --> 1:08:52.460
Jonesy's fuckin' shredded.

1:08:53.830 --> 1:08:56.798
(Danny coughing)

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:59.667
(Danny groaning)

1:09:07.177 --> 1:09:09.644
(tense music)

1:09:28.932 --> 1:09:30.598
- Hey!

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:31.466
Hey!

1:09:31.468 --> 1:09:32.667
Who stole my meds.

1:09:34.838 --> 1:09:35.770
- Singer what?

1:09:37.707 --> 1:09:39.240
What are you doing?

1:09:39.242 --> 1:09:41.809
- Taking charge of your shit
show chief.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.280
- You can't do that, it's my
show.

1:09:46.216 --> 1:09:47.282
- You gonna stop me.

1:09:48.785 --> 1:09:49.951
Good luck with that.

1:09:55.592 --> 1:09:57.926
First thing we're gonna
do is beef up security.

1:09:59.763 --> 1:10:02.330
We're getting out of here
tomorrow.

1:10:02.332 --> 1:10:03.965
We just gotta survive tonight.

1:10:14.711 --> 1:10:15.777
Here you go.

1:10:17.214 --> 1:10:17.946
- Yeah.

1:10:19.749 --> 1:10:21.216
- You got this?

1:10:22.219 --> 1:10:22.951
- Yeah.

1:10:26.790 --> 1:10:28.856
- Full mag, one in the chamber.

1:10:28.858 --> 1:10:29.824
Safety's on.

1:10:35.632 --> 1:10:36.564
No shit.

1:10:38.835 --> 1:10:39.767
- Afghanistan.

1:10:40.770 --> 1:10:42.470
Helmand Province.

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:44.672
Thought I'd fired my last shots
there.

1:10:44.674 --> 1:10:45.607
Guess not.

1:11:08.932 --> 1:11:09.864
How's Danny?

1:11:12.736 --> 1:11:15.036
- He's a little banged up,
but he'll be all right.

1:11:17.540 --> 1:11:18.640
So what's next?

1:11:19.776 --> 1:11:20.708
- We wait.

1:11:22.279 --> 1:11:23.011
- Yup.

1:11:25.382 --> 1:11:27.782
Maybe...

1:11:27.784 --> 1:11:30.818
(suspenseful music)

1:11:50.674 --> 1:11:53.541
(device beeping)

1:11:57.847 --> 1:11:58.813
- Tracking device.

1:11:58.815 --> 1:11:59.814
Bait's on the move.

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:01.816
- It's hauling ass.

1:12:01.818 --> 1:12:04.952
- Jesus.
(beast roaring)

1:12:04.954 --> 1:12:05.887
Let's go.

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.805
- Think it's stopped.

1:12:25.008 --> 1:12:26.107
50 meters away.

1:12:39.956 --> 1:12:41.989
- [John] Barnes, you got
anything?

1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:44.125
- [Cooper] No.

1:12:44.127 --> 1:12:45.059
Do you?

1:12:46.496 --> 1:12:47.495
- [John] Negative.

1:12:51.935 --> 1:12:52.867
- What is that smell?

1:12:52.868 --> 1:12:53.800
- I think it's what we're
looking for.

1:13:20.029 --> 1:13:21.696
- It's right over there.

1:13:21.698 --> 1:13:22.563
- [Cooper] Over there?

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:24.632
- Yeah, it's over there.

1:13:45.889 --> 1:13:47.822
It's right over there.

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:57.632
(low growling)

1:13:58.435 --> 1:14:02.203
(creature screeching)
(gunshot banging)

1:14:02.205 --> 1:14:03.104
You okay?

1:14:05.041 --> 1:14:06.040
- I'm fine.

1:14:16.152 --> 1:14:17.952
- Uh Singer.

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:18.920
- It's a raccoon.

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:24.692
- I think there's still
something out there!

1:14:24.694 --> 1:14:25.893
- What?

1:14:25.895 --> 1:14:28.095
- There's still something out
there.

1:14:28.097 --> 1:14:30.631
There's something moving,
I don't know what it is.

1:14:30.633 --> 1:14:32.834
- Yeah, a goddamn raccoon.

1:14:36.172 --> 1:14:37.505
- Singer!

1:14:37.507 --> 1:14:39.574
- Look behind you.

1:14:39.576 --> 1:14:40.508
- Singer!

1:14:41.177 --> 1:14:42.109
No!

1:14:45.215 --> 1:14:48.483
(creature growling)

1:14:50.086 --> 1:14:51.486
- We gotta go!

1:14:52.255 --> 1:14:54.655
(tense music)

1:14:54.657 --> 1:14:55.990
- Where are you?

1:14:58.094 --> 1:14:59.961
(gunshot banging)

1:14:59.963 --> 1:15:01.929
(creature growling)

1:15:01.931 --> 1:15:03.631
(gunshot banging)

1:15:03.633 --> 1:15:04.899
- [Ellen] Okay.

1:15:06.769 --> 1:15:07.702
Danny over here.

1:15:11.608 --> 1:15:14.775
(Bridgette screaming)

1:15:16.713 --> 1:15:18.112
Oh my god, Danny!

1:15:19.249 --> 1:15:22.149
(gunshot banging)

1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.052
No! No!

1:15:31.928 --> 1:15:32.927
(gunshot banging)

1:15:32.929 --> 1:15:34.128
- What the fuck.

1:15:34.130 --> 1:15:35.263
- Hey! Hey!

1:15:35.265 --> 1:15:36.664
- [Rick] Where's Singer?

1:15:36.666 --> 1:15:38.483
- He's dead.

1:15:38.484 --> 1:15:40.301
- What the fuck are you talking
about?

1:15:40.303 --> 1:15:42.169
- That thing ripped his throat
out.

1:15:44.173 --> 1:15:45.239
- Danny's dead too.

1:15:50.980 --> 1:15:52.180
- What now?

1:15:52.181 --> 1:15:53.381
- We can go back to the
helicopter

1:15:53.382 --> 1:15:54.582
and see if that sat
phone is still working.

1:15:54.584 --> 1:15:56.117
- Any place is better than here.

1:16:15.305 --> 1:16:19.173
(Bridgette groaning)

1:16:19.175 --> 1:16:23.311
- When Brannan hears about
this shit, you're done.

1:16:23.313 --> 1:16:25.112
He told me about you.

1:16:25.114 --> 1:16:28.883
Your career has been a
complete cluster fuck.

1:16:28.885 --> 1:16:30.818
Fuck up after fuck up.

1:16:33.623 --> 1:16:36.290
Maybe, Brannan will let you
fetch me

1:16:36.292 --> 1:16:39.060
my coffee on my next show.

1:16:39.062 --> 1:16:42.830
Two fucking creams, two fucking
sugars.

1:16:42.832 --> 1:16:44.098
- Rick help me with her.

1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:46.100
- Get me my fucking refill.

1:16:49.172 --> 1:16:51.973
(ominous music)

1:16:53.776 --> 1:16:55.876
(gunshots banging)
- No!

1:16:55.878 --> 1:16:58.813
(gunshot banging)

1:17:15.932 --> 1:17:16.998
- Bridgette!

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.132
Bridgette!

1:17:18.134 --> 1:17:19.066
Bridgette!

1:17:26.876 --> 1:17:27.875
Let me see.

1:17:29.912 --> 1:17:31.312
Let me see.

1:17:31.314 --> 1:17:32.980
Okay, he missed your liver.

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:35.016
We have to get him out of
here before he bleeds out.

1:17:41.758 --> 1:17:42.857
Okay.

1:17:42.858 --> 1:17:43.957

You talk, you talk, and not say
anything.
