There's Dragonicus.

Now I'm going to find
Castleopeia.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.170
I don't believe it.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.838
Well, it is possible,
Sofia.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.040
My new telescope
lets me see things

01:15.042 --> 01:16.375
that are really far away.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.410
No, not that.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.080
It's these amazing
creatures I'm reading
about called sealians.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.182
Oh. What's so amazing
about them?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.250
They're half-seal,
so they can swim and flip,

01:25.252 --> 01:27.352
and do all sorts of
seal stuff in water.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.855
But sealians are also
half-human,

01:29.857 --> 01:31.356
so they can walk on land.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.125
Look.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.693
Hmm.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.196
"Sealian expert
Professor Zacharias Fleeber

01:37.198 --> 01:40.132
says some people think
sealians sing a magical song

01:40.134 --> 01:42.301
that puts people
under a spell."

01:42.303 --> 01:43.869
A spell? Really?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.804
- That's what it says.
- Huh.

01:45.806 --> 01:49.274
Now back to star gazing.
Oops!

01:50.810 --> 01:53.545
Huh? What's this?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.581
( chuckles )
Silly Rex.

01:55.583 --> 01:59.384
( laughing )
Oopsies!

02:00.587 --> 02:02.821
Oh, he scared the maids.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.823
Watching the stars is fun,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.725
but watching people
is even more fun.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.595
Dinner is served,
my ladies.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.063
Come on, Amber.
Let's go.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.031
Oh, all right.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.070
And the book also said
not much is known about sealians

02:18.072 --> 02:20.939
because they live on an island
in the Stormy Triangle,

02:20.941 --> 02:22.908
this rainy part
of the ocean

02:22.910 --> 02:24.076
that's really hard
to sail through.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.911
- Awesome!
- Yes, indeed.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.580
Now, since your father
is in Tangu

02:28.582 --> 02:30.449
for the Tri-Kingdom Summit,

02:30.451 --> 02:32.918
it's the perfect time to discuss
his birthday tomorrow.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.121
Oh, I've already planned
a fabulous party,

02:36.123 --> 02:38.423
complete with Daddy's
favorite foods.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.859
Spoiler alert! There'll be
jiggly-wiggly pudding.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.762
I've got a pretty special
surprise up my sleeve, too.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.864
I'd tell you,
but it's a surprise.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.467
I haven't got Dad
anything for his birthday yet.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.270
I have a hard time
getting your father
presents, too.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.472
After all,
he is the king.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.941
But I'm sure he'll love
anything you give him, Sofia.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.443
May I be excused?
I need to walk Rex.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.279
Have you eaten
your vegetables?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.647
Yup. Every one.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.515
They were dee-lish.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.450
May I be excused, too?

03:05.452 --> 03:07.386
I can't wait to get back
to my new telescope.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.288
You may be excused.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.789
Thank you, Mother.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.694
Do you think I could see
all the way to
the Stormy Triangle

03:15.696 --> 03:17.162
with your telescope?

03:17.164 --> 03:19.498
Uh, let's find out.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.667
( gasps )
Oh, well, well, well.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.168
What do we have here?

03:23.170 --> 03:25.671
James is not walking Rex
like he said he was.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.806
He's not?
What's he doing?

03:27.808 --> 03:31.009
He's dumping the vegetables
he said he ate into the garden.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.145
Why would he do that?

03:33.147 --> 03:35.013
Do I understand
my brother's silly ways?

03:35.015 --> 03:36.548
No.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.517
Would I make sure
they get him in trouble?

03:38.519 --> 03:41.053
- Yes.
- Wait. Amber!

03:43.323 --> 03:45.424
Amber, it might not be
what it looks like.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.025
I saw it through
my telescope.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.660
Aha!

03:48.662 --> 03:49.695
Aha what?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.363
I thought
I heard voices.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.031
What are you kids
doing out at night?

03:53.033 --> 03:54.933
Unfortunately, Mother,

03:54.935 --> 03:56.535
I'm catching James
in a lie.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.371
He didn't eat his vegetables
at dinner like he said,

03:59.373 --> 04:02.374
but instead, came out
here and threw them away.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.009
I did not.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.245
I was just feeding
these little guys.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.013
- Bunnies.
- Cute, right?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.349
I found them earlier and wanted
to bring them some food.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.352
Oh. Uh...
is that so?

04:13.354 --> 04:15.254
Sure is,
and just so you know,

04:15.256 --> 04:18.190
these are extra veggies the chef
gave me from the kitchen.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.860
You almost got James
in trouble when he was
doing something nice.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.396
Amber, your father and I
got you that telescope

04:24.398 --> 04:25.864
to look at stars,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.599
not to watch people
without them knowing it.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.435
- That's called spying.
- I know.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.771
And when you spy on
something from far away,

04:32.773 --> 04:35.240
it can look a lot different
than what's really going on.

04:35.242 --> 04:36.541
I guess
you're right.

04:36.543 --> 04:39.778
I won't spy with
my telescope anymore.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.080
Unless I see something
really interesting.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.215
Amber.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.883
Okay.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.019
I promise not to
do it again.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.791
Ready for breakfast,
Amber?

04:53.726 --> 04:56.428
You're not spying
again, are you?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.163
I didn't mean to, Sofia.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.731
I was putting away
my telescope,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.833
and something
caught my eye outside.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.269
- I just had to get
a closer look.
- Amber.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.138
I think you should
look, too.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.839
I think I see
a sealian.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.043
- What? Where?
- Right there.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.146
Whoa!

05:17.650 --> 05:20.686
Doesn't it look just like
the sealian in this picture?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.455
The same whiskers
and shiny skin
and everything.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.757
But sealians live in
the Stormy Triangle.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.993
Why would one be here
in Enchancia?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.095
( blaring sound )

05:30.097 --> 05:31.830
That must be...

05:31.832 --> 05:33.265
BOTH: the sealian song.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.466
What does it mean?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.635
"Some people think

05:36.637 --> 05:38.503
the sealians use
an eerie song

05:38.505 --> 05:40.439
to put people
under a spell,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.774
and lure them out to
the Stormy Triangle,

05:42.776 --> 05:45.577
where they're never
heard from again."

05:48.614 --> 05:50.782
There's someone walking
toward the dock.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.217
But can you see
who it is?

05:54.654 --> 05:56.822
- ( gasps )
It's Mom!
- What?!

05:56.824 --> 05:58.890
She's getting on the boat
with the sealian.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.792
The sealian must be
luring her

06:00.794 --> 06:02.461
to the Stormy Triangle
with its song.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.962
We have to tell Dad.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.465
But he's in Tangu,
remember?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.767
Oh! Then we have to
go after her ourselves.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.577
Come on, Minimus.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.245
You, too, Saffron.

06:20.247 --> 06:21.680
Okay, yeah,
where we goin'?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.382
Park, circus,
Dunwiddie County Fair?

06:23.384 --> 06:25.650
I heard the kettle corn there
is mighty tasty.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.185
SOFIA: Yah!

06:27.187 --> 06:29.221
MINIMUS: Whoa! Guess she'll
tell us on the way.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.989
AMBER: Go, Saffron, go!

06:30.991 --> 06:33.225
Let's get to
the harbor, Minimus.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.660
The harbor? Are we gonna spend
the day at the beach?

06:35.662 --> 06:38.563
Sweet jimmies,
that sounds fun!

06:43.836 --> 06:46.171
Oh, Sofia,
they've already left.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.374
Come on. We've got to save Mom
from that sealian.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.743
AMBER: They're probably headed
for the Stormy Triangle.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.712
Stormy Triangle?
Sealian?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.014
This doesn't sound like
the fun day I had in mind.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.984
- Yah, Minimus!
- Go, Saffron, go!

07:03.189 --> 07:04.589
I don't see
that boat anywhere.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.224
What do we do now?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.059
We have to keep looking.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.861
Let's go this way.

07:13.132 --> 07:14.800
AMBER: I'm soaked!

07:14.802 --> 07:17.302
There wasn't a cloud
in the sky a minute ago.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.237
We must be in
the Stormy Triangle.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.239
How long are these storms
supposed to last?

07:21.241 --> 07:23.208
The book said they could
be over quickly,

07:23.210 --> 07:24.409
or last for hours.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.877
( thunder crashes )

07:25.879 --> 07:28.180
Keep going, Mini!

07:36.589 --> 07:38.457
Oh, storm's over.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.092
- Good flying, Minimus.
- Thanks. Can we go home now?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.228
Sofia, look.
An island.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.863
And there's someone
on the beach.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.407
Excuse me.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.075
Hello.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.777
Hello!
Excuse me, sir.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.882
Oh, wait.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.618
That's better.
Yes, hello.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.687
What brings you to
this remote island?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.456
We're looking for
a boat with our mother on it.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.791
Have you seen
any go by?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.093
Hm, boats, boats, boats.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.528
Let me check.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.030
Great galoshes,
I see one!

08:19.032 --> 08:20.932
Oh, that's my boat,

08:20.934 --> 08:22.534
so that's not what you're
looking for, is it?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.202
Is it?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.104
No. A sealian
took our mom on a boat

08:26.106 --> 08:27.472
much bigger than that.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.941
Sealian?
Did you say sealian?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.543
You said sealian,
right?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.944
- Yes.
- Why?

08:32.946 --> 08:36.147
Because I,
Professor Zacharias Fleeber,

08:36.149 --> 08:38.183
braved the journey
to this island

08:38.185 --> 08:40.285
in the heart of
the Stormy Triangle

08:40.287 --> 08:41.786
to study sealians
up close and personal.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.622
<i>The </i> Zacharias Fleeber?

08:43.624 --> 08:45.123
At your service.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.126
I read about you in
my book on mysterious creatures.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.661
You're an expert
on sealians.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.997
Indeed I do.
I mean, I am.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.666
Then maybe you could
tell us where they might
be taking our mom.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.301
Maybe I could...

08:56.303 --> 08:59.004
if I were really
an expert on sealians.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.805
But I thought...

09:00.807 --> 09:04.175
The truth is that no one
is really an expert on sealians.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.478
They are so rare
and hard to find

09:06.480 --> 09:09.014
that no one knows
very much about them,
including me.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.017
Why, I've never even
seen a sealian up close.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.885
In fact, no one has.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.420
Not me nor you
nor you nor me.

09:15.422 --> 09:16.888
Oh, I already
counted myself.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.658
So everything you said
in that article was just...

09:19.660 --> 09:22.427
Guesses, hunches,
big number crunches.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.195
That's why I'm here,
to finally find out

09:24.197 --> 09:26.097
what sealians
are really like.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.832
What do they eat,
how long do they sleep?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.735
Do they do jigsaw puzzles?
No, probably not.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.837
( sighs ) It's not easy
being an expert on something

09:32.839 --> 09:34.072
you know nothing about.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.078
By gads,
that's a great idea.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.448
You've got flying horses,
I got a telescope.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.418

to find your mother
and the sealians.

You can ride
with me, Professor.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.893
Actually, factually,

11:34.895 --> 11:36.828
might be a bit
squished on those steeds.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.129
I'll take my boat.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.531
You girls
fly alongside.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.304
Hm. Every shell
has a strange hole.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.074
Curious.
Very curious.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.742
Are you ready?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.144
Oh, yes. Just let me
pack a few supplies.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.814
Let's see.
I may need this.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.316
It's always good
to have this.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.151
Probably won't need this,
but you never know.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.821
Oh, this will be
most handy.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.322
All right,
I'm ready.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.924
Let's go.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.697
Nothing. We've looked
everywhere, and nothing.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.499
We haven't looked
everywhere.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.334
Really? Where
haven't we looked?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.002
Wherever they are,
of course.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.304
My brain hurts.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.678
Great Scott,
I've got something!

12:26.680 --> 12:29.347
- Do you see our mom?
- Alas, no.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.250
But I think I see
real live sealians.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.252
Let's not get
too excited.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.621
They could be dolphins
or a pod of whales,

12:36.623 --> 12:38.757
or they could be sealians!
We must get closer.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.028
Oh, a shiny coat.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.630
Fluked tail.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.365
Wiry whiskers.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.567
Sealium humanus!

12:49.569 --> 12:52.570
- They are sealians!
- Wow!

12:52.572 --> 12:55.740
Have you ever seen
such fascinating creatures?

12:55.742 --> 12:58.042
Where's my notebook,
my sketch pad?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.044
Professor!

13:00.046 --> 13:02.447
- Steady there, fella.
- Look at that.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.289
Even more fascinating
than I thought they were

13:11.291 --> 13:13.625
two seconds ago.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.903
We have to follow them.

13:24.905 --> 13:25.970
They might lead us
to Mom.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.806
- Yes, please.
- No, thank you.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.241
They also might put us
under the same spell.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.743
We have to
take that chance

13:31.745 --> 13:33.144
if we want
to save Mom.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.646
( thunder crashes )

13:34.648 --> 13:36.815
Oh, no,
the Stormy Triangle.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.917
- Not again.
- Ah, crumbs.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.586
( frustrated sigh )
This rain is too much.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.921
Just hang on tight.

13:42.923 --> 13:46.090
The rain's ruining
my sealian sketch.

13:46.092 --> 13:49.861
Or is it making them
look even more fascinating?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.767
Maybe if we go in
the same direction as the wind,

13:55.769 --> 13:57.936
we can fly out
of the storm.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.204
Okay.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.118
Whoa, Minimus.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.528
Is everyone all right?

14:23.530 --> 14:24.696
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.398
- Just peachy.
- Not at all.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.206
( gasps )

14:35.208 --> 14:38.209
What on earth...
Girls?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.477
What are you doing
out here?

14:39.479 --> 14:40.678
- Mom?
- Mother!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.647
We're so glad
we found you.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.650
We thought that sealian
was gonna take you away forever.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.218
Sealian?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.853
What are you talking about?

14:48.855 --> 14:50.922
I saw it with
my telescope.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.091
A sealian lured you
onto his boat.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.592
I saw it, too.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.094
Then we heard
this strange sound,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.829
so we knew it put you
under a spell.

14:57.831 --> 15:00.698
( snapping fingers )
Are you okay?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.600
Do you know
where you are?

15:02.602 --> 15:05.236
Amber, I am not
under a spell.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.771
That's probably the spell
making her say that.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.773
Who are you?

15:08.775 --> 15:11.109
Professor Zacharias Fleeber.
At your service, my lady.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.577
Is it true?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.212
Have you recently had
a close encounter

15:14.214 --> 15:15.847
- with a sealian?
- ( laughs )

15:15.849 --> 15:17.548
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.683
There it is.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.319
Stay back!

15:23.589 --> 15:26.724
Relax, everyone.
This is no sealian.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.227
Yes, girls,
the professor's right.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.062
Take a good look.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.864
Wait. You don't have
shiny seal skin.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.198
Or whiskers.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
Nope. Just a regular
old mustache

15:36.202 --> 15:38.036
and rain slicker,
I'm afraid.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.906
Captain McIntosh has been
giving me sailing lessons

15:41.908 --> 15:43.775
so I can surprise
your father,

15:43.777 --> 15:46.077
and take him sailing
for his birthday.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.745
Sailing lessons?

15:47.747 --> 15:50.748
So nothing we saw
through the telescope

15:50.750 --> 15:52.216
turned out to be
what we thought it was?

15:52.218 --> 15:54.118
It's like I was
telling you before.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.887
When you spy on things
from afar,

15:55.889 --> 15:57.889
they can look different
from what they really are.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.597
Your Majesty, I thought
we'd wait till the storm passed

16:06.599 --> 16:09.133
to sail home,
but with our sail torn,

16:09.135 --> 16:10.802
I'm afraid we're
not going anywhere.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.973
Maybe our horses
can pull us.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.741
The ship's too heavy
for that.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.910
Oh, if I just listened
to you, Mom,

16:18.912 --> 16:20.244
we wouldn't be
stuck out here.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.414
I let my imagination
run wild, too.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.983
If we ever get home,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.352
I promise I will
never spy again.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.920
I won't either.
Never, ever.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.421
( eerie sound )

16:30.423 --> 16:32.824
- What was that?
- Do we have to find out?

16:37.763 --> 16:39.263
Sealians!

16:39.265 --> 16:41.766
( seal-like barking )

16:41.768 --> 16:44.102
Oh, my!
Stay back, girls.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.770
I don't think
they'll harm us.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.038
We can't be sure.

16:48.974 --> 16:51.009
What do you want from us?

16:51.011 --> 16:53.177
Hello, everyone.
How are we all doin'?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.612
How are we all doing?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.014
Don't be scared of us.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.482
We're very friendly.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.684
Sorry for jumping on
your ship uninvited,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.652
but we were hoping
you could help us get home.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.855
Help you? How?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.391
Okay, so this is
the situation.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.892
We were out surfing
this morning,

17:07.894 --> 17:11.329
and these big waves
crashed on us.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.532
Knocked our cocohorns
right out of our hands.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.733
Cocohorns?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.536
We sealians use these
special coconut shells

17:18.538 --> 17:21.239
with holes in the top
as horns. Toot!

17:21.241 --> 17:22.874
And without your horns,

17:22.876 --> 17:24.242
you couldn't put
people under spells.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.344
Nah, that's just a rumor.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.012
We don't put people
under spells.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.747
We use the horns
to help each other

17:29.749 --> 17:32.483
find our way out of
the rainstorms in
the Stormy Triangle.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.153
Like, hello!
We're lost in the storm!

17:35.155 --> 17:36.654
Toot, toot, toot.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.222
And then I'd be, like,

17:38.224 --> 17:40.358
Swim this way.
Toot, toot, toot.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.994
But with no horns,
no way home.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.029
We've been swimming around
for a while now.

17:45.031 --> 17:48.399
We were getting
a bit worried actually.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.235
Wait a minute.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.870
Did you say your cocohorns
have holes?

17:52.872 --> 17:55.039
Mm-hmm. Like a regular horn.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.875
On the beach, you put
some coconut shells
in your bag, remember?

17:57.877 --> 18:00.745
I did? Oh, yes.
So I did.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.047
There you are.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.516
We found these on
the island earlier.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.517
Are these cocohorns?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.419
Yes, they are.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.290
Wait. Maybe you can
help us get home, too.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.692
- How?
- You use your horns

18:14.694 --> 18:16.561
to get out of the rain,
and we'll follow you.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.797
- Yeah, we'd love to help.
- Good idea, Sofia.

18:19.799 --> 18:23.367
But first, we're going to need
to repair that sail.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.903
Well, you're looking at
a former shoemaker.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.306
I think I can
patch up a sail...

18:28.308 --> 18:30.374
with this.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.647
Looks good,
Your Majesty.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.217
Nice work, Mother.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.590
All righty,
everyone.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.924
Just follow
the sound of our horn.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.693
We'll get you
outta here.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.031
( horns blowing )

18:56.068 --> 18:58.402
Nothing's happening.
I don't hear anything.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.738
( horns blowing
in distance )

19:00.740 --> 19:02.306
The other sealians
are answering.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.509
Oh, fascinating.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.310
Outrageously fascinating.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.045
That way.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.517
( horns blowing )

19:12.519 --> 19:14.452
( horns blowing
in response )

19:14.454 --> 19:17.655
Hang on. We're almost
out of the storm.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.325
Best news I've
heard all day.

19:38.277 --> 19:39.944
There they are.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.613
Should I take notes
or should I observe?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.549
Or should I observe
and then take notes?

19:47.619 --> 19:49.620
- Dad!
- Boys!

19:49.622 --> 19:52.123
Are we glad
to see you.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.658
I was so worried.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.393
We've been looking
for you all day.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.963
- Who are they?
- They helped us get home.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.832
Yes, they did.
I mean, we did.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.001
And if it's
all right, sir,

20:04.003 --> 20:05.803
I'd like to study
your ways

20:05.805 --> 20:07.638
so I can tell the world
what you're really like.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.374
These guys had
some funny ideas about us, Dad.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.978
Yeah, like we put people
under spells with our cocohorns.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.646
Where did they ever
get that idea?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.148
We were just guessing.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.883
Since no one ever came to
the Stormy Triangle

20:18.885 --> 20:21.152
to see you sealians
with their own eyes.

20:21.154 --> 20:24.855
Well, we don't want
people thinking strange
things about us.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.091
Perhaps you should
stay with us for a while

20:27.093 --> 20:28.526
and tell our story.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.660
Thank you.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.696
My dream has
come true!

20:31.698 --> 20:32.997
Now don't worry.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.266
I won't get in
your way at all.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.005
Quick reflexes.
Fascinating.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.673
Dad will be home soon,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.509
and we still have to sail
through the Stormy Triangle.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.011
We better get going.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.846
( blowing horns )

20:48.848 --> 20:50.514
Wait a minute.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.783
Dad! I still need a present
for his birthday.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.853
Would it be okay
if I took one of
your cocohorns?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.521
I know he's just
love one.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.694
Here. Something to
remember us by.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.429
Thanks.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.368
Good-bye, girls.
Thank you!

21:10.370 --> 21:12.403
- Thanks for
your help.
- Safe travels.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.172
- Good-bye.
- Good luck with your
research, Professor.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.281
MIRANDA: Coming about!

21:26.885 --> 21:28.586
Just so you know, Sofia,

21:28.588 --> 21:30.588
you owe me a nice,
relaxing day at the beach.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.491
And a little kettle corn
wouldn't hurt neither.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.234
Well, I've got my pudding,

21:43.236 --> 21:45.903
I'm going on a sailing
trip with my queen.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.172
What more could a man
want for his birthday?

21:48.174 --> 21:50.908
I'm hoping
something like this.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.443
It's a sealian's horn.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.779
Is it now?
Fantastic!

21:54.781 --> 21:56.480
I don't have
anything like it.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.685
You know what? That'll go
real well with my gift.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.754
I was gonna give you
a private bagpipe concert,

22:03.756 --> 22:05.756
but we can make it
a duet.

22:05.758 --> 22:09.260
( bagpipes blast )

22:09.262 --> 22:11.128
Do you know what
that sounds like?

22:11.130 --> 22:14.265
What we thought was
the sealian song this morning.

22:14.267 --> 22:15.800
Boy, were we wrong.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.336
( music continues )
