WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:07.075
Hey, Kenny, good news.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
I only had to replace
a few hoses

00:09.077 --> 00:10.311
and refill your coolant.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.745
Oh, that is good news.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.049
Now, a more unscrupulous
mechanic would've told you

00:15.149 --> 00:17.785
it was your water pump, and
charged you an arm and a leg.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.554
But you're in luck because
I got all my scruples.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.989
(laughs)

00:22.090 --> 00:24.492
Well, I'm glad my car
broke down near your shop,

00:24.592 --> 00:26.594
'cause I usually take
my car to Motor Boys.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.763
Motor Boys?
Do you hate your cars?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.766
No, I have a service
contract with them.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.336
They take care of my fleet
of black cars and sprinters.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.838
Hey, guess who one
of my drivers

00:37.938 --> 00:39.407
just picked up from LAX.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.109
The mom from
Home Improvement.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.611
I have heard of that person.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.480
And it would be a shame

00:46.580 --> 00:48.582
if she got stranded
on the 405

00:48.682 --> 00:51.352
because Motor Boys forgot
to replace your radiator hoses.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.986
That would not be good.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.189
Anyway, I gotta go pick up
my son at baseball.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.890
Oh, oh, your son
plays baseball?

00:56.990 --> 00:58.792
Yeah. Since he was
six years old.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.329
The boy eats, drinks
and sleeps baseball.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.864
(chuckling):
Sounds like my son Malcolm.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.599
He actually would have
made it to the big leagues

01:05.699 --> 01:06.767
if he hadn't gotten injured.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.503
But now he's
a batting coach for USC.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.106
Wow. That's one of the best
programs in the country.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.307
Yeah.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.643
Kenny, how about
I talk to my son about

01:15.743 --> 01:19.113
taking your son
to the next level?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.615
I likes the sound of that.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.784
I thought that you would.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.820
Kenny Phillips,
KP Luxury Transportation.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.191
You know, Kenny,
if I scratch someone's back,

01:30.291 --> 01:35.229
and then I realize, oh,
I'm feeling a little itchy...

01:35.329 --> 01:37.631
maybe I can get
my back scratched, too.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.801
You know,
one hand washes the other.

01:40.901 --> 01:44.071
The quid becomes the pro quo,
the yin becomes the yang,

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140
the wu becomes the tang.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.212
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

01:51.312 --> 01:52.546
* Welcome to the hood. *

01:58.419 --> 02:00.588
Hey, honey.
How was your day?

02:00.688 --> 02:01.855
Well, I went to
the farmers' market,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.224
and two great things happened.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.393
First of all,
I got a box of dough-nots.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.694
Ooh, doughnuts.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.995
No, no, no.
Not-not doughnuts.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.365
Dough-nots, as in
"not a doughnut."

02:12.433 --> 02:15.803
They're not fried, they're vegan
and they're gluten-free.

02:15.903 --> 02:19.240
Well, I dough-not want one.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.011
Your loss. Ah.
The second thing is

02:24.111 --> 02:25.713
I bumped into your
old friend Linzie.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.882
Linzie from Hickory Corners?
Yeah.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.284
Huh, that's nice.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.519
That's nice?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.453
I thought you'd be
more excited about Linzie.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.087
And the dough-nots.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.492
It's just... when I won the
Miss Hickory Corners pageant,

02:38.592 --> 02:39.727
Linzie was the runner-up.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.229
Afterwards, it was awkward.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.096
Well, the best woman won.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.164
And I married
a beauty pageant winner,

02:44.265 --> 02:47.201
so in a way, I won, too.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.337
I haven't seen her in years.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.138
How did you even
recognize her?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.606
I didn't.
She recognized me.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.008
Please tell me you did not
invite Linzie over.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.711
No, I did not
invite Linzie over.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.647
So you did.
I did.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.221
Hey, Pop, I got your text.
What's the emergency?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.156
Ah, there's no emergency.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.992
Your father just wants
to pimp you out to a customer.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.996
Uh, Mama, I'm gonna need
more context than that.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.833
Listen, son, come on,
have a seat, man.

03:19.933 --> 03:20.868
Right here.
In your chair?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:22.303 --> 03:25.205
Look, a big opportunity
just fell into my lap.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.476
I got a new customer
who owns a fleet of cars,

03:28.576 --> 03:31.345
and I want to land
his service contract.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.581
It just so happens
that he has a son

03:33.681 --> 03:37.785
that is a high school
baseball prospect, so...

03:37.885 --> 03:39.687
Here comes the pimp part.

03:41.589 --> 03:45.259
I told him you'd be
the kid's private batting coach.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.094
Really? No, that's awesome.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.029
There's good money in that.
(chuckles)

03:49.129 --> 03:51.599
Not for you.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.535
Tina, would you let me
talk to my son?

03:54.635 --> 03:55.769
Okay.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.439
Not for you.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.408
But you'd be
doing me a solid.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.676
And the kid,
he's really good.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.379
All right?
He's a four-star prospect.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.147
Just needs
a great batting coach

04:07.247 --> 04:08.549
to get him up to five.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.051
Okay, well, I mean,
I gotta admit,

04:11.151 --> 04:12.953
if I brought the school
a hot recruit,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.655
that would be a good look
for me.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.725
Yes, it would be
a good look for you.
Yeah.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.060
This is about you.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.496
And if you make
thousands of dollars

04:22.596 --> 04:24.532
off the dad,
it's a good look for you.

04:24.632 --> 04:28.035
That's just the sacrifice
I'm willing to make, Tina.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.507
Okay, Peter, widen
your stance a little.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.743
Okay, here we go.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.911
Whoo! Ho, ho!

04:38.011 --> 04:39.079
That's what I'm talking about.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.515
Oh, you got a lot of power.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.451
Okay, I'm gonna take
some speed off the ball,

04:43.551 --> 04:46.654
and that's gonna allow you
to focus on your mechanics.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.756
(laughing)

04:51.258 --> 04:53.427
What's, uh...
What's so funny?

04:53.527 --> 04:56.730
Man, this monkey keeps
smelling his own butt.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.199
(laughing)

04:59.299 --> 05:00.801
A monkey. Uh, Peter,

05:00.901 --> 05:02.603
if you don't get your head
in the game,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.838
you'll be smelling your butt
on the bench.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.408
All right, now, look,

05:07.508 --> 05:08.442
I'm gonna put a little
curve on the ball.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.743
Oh, man, I hate curveballs.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.178
They're hard to hit.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.348
Yeah, Peter, that's why
pitchers throw them.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.185
And you'll be seeing a lot more
of those in college.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.521
All right? Now, stay in there,
stay focused.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.492
Okay.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.495
Ah! Hey, that's okay.
Peter, Peter,

05:27.595 --> 05:30.531
keep the weight on
the balls of your feet.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.232
Here we go.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.269
Come on, Peter.
Look, attack the ball, man.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.006
Beast mode.
Let your beast out, man.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.574
(growls)

05:42.410 --> 05:45.879
Whoo-ho-ho! Yes!
That is it.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.948
So we're done, right?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.517
Ah.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.085
No, we are not done.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.887
Is there somewhere else
you'd rather be?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.122
Well, yeah, actually...

05:55.222 --> 05:56.724
Hey, that was a
rhetorical question.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.161
Thanks for coming
tonight, T.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.530
I really needed a buffer.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.665
Things could get
a little weird.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.166
Oh, that's just Dave.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.436
I've grown to love that
about him.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.939
I'm not talking about Dave,
I'm talking about Linzie.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.207
Aw, don't worry
about it. Look.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.577
Her and Calvin are
getting along great.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.079
Then, after my divorce,
I got a job

06:19.179 --> 06:20.748
at a chicken
processing plant.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.015
Mm.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.517
My thumb got caught
in the machinery.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.185
(mouthing)
Yeah.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.354
Luckily, it was
a clean cut.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.289
This is actually
my big toe.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.460
(Calvin chuckles)

06:32.560 --> 06:34.662
Damn, I just shook your hand.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.032
You must have gotten
a big settlement.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.168
Oh, yeah, huge.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.370
I invested it all in Bitmoney.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.405
You mean Bitcoin.
I wish.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.675
CALVIN:
Uh, uh...

06:47.775 --> 06:49.943
quick question.
Do you get a mani

06:50.043 --> 06:51.712
or a pedi on that?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.349
So, uh, is this your first time
out in L.A.?

06:56.450 --> 06:58.652
Yeah. What better time to travel

06:58.752 --> 07:01.121
than right after
you've just been evicted?

07:01.221 --> 07:02.856
(laughs weakly)

07:02.956 --> 07:06.460
But, hey, I'm all about
that van life.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.966
I'm afraid to ask
another question. Anybody...?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.637
So what brought you
out to Pasadena?

07:16.737 --> 07:18.706
I came to be on
The Price is Right.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.140
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, that's fun.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.408
It should have been,

07:21.509 --> 07:23.644
but I never got to
"come on down."

07:23.744 --> 07:25.278
Damn.

07:25.378 --> 07:29.082
I bet if Gemma was there,
she would have won.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.485
She wins everything.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.554
Oh, it was just one
silly pageant.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.689
Well, it came with
a college scholarship

07:35.789 --> 07:38.191
and got you out of
Hickory Corners.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.627
And look at you now.

07:40.528 --> 07:44.364
College didn't do
that much for me.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.499
Gemma, it's okay.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.301
She deserved
to win that pageant.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.138
You should have seen her.
Great magic tricks.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.641
You were--
You were great, too.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.476
She played "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow" on spoons.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.246
I'm not gonna lie,
I would've liked

07:59.346 --> 08:01.615
to see that right there.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.986
But where you crushed it
was the public speaking.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.622
That story was so beautiful.

08:08.722 --> 08:12.159
Her horse died
and it broke her heart.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.226
And the judges'.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.096
Oh, Gemma,
you had a horse?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.465
Yeah, you never told me
you had a horse.
Mm.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.367
Yep. It just up and died. So...

08:20.467 --> 08:23.370
Anyway... who wants to see
a magic trick?

08:23.470 --> 08:26.674
I'm gonna make dinner appear.
(laughs)

08:26.774 --> 08:29.677
You know what,
I'm gonna get some more wine.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.612
Ooh, and, uh, get some spoons.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.247
Do you know any
Kenny Loggins?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.249
Your friend Linzie,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.886
she's a little...
different.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.889
Mm-hmm.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.557
Gemma?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.927
You okay?
No.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.163
Calvin, that story I told
to win the pageant...

08:50.263 --> 08:52.532
About the dead horse?
It was a lie.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.602
The horse is alive?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.170
No, the story was
about my aunt.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.006
Your aunt died?

08:59.106 --> 09:01.675
You should have gone with that.
That's way sadder.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.845
No. No, my aunt didn't die.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.181
I mean, she's dead now,
but she was alive then.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.517
So was there ever
a horse?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.285
Yes!

09:12.385 --> 09:14.387
I'm not a crazy person.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.889
It was my aunt's horse.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.959
But I went up on that stage,
and I said it was mine,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.028
and I fake-cried
in front of the judges,

09:21.128 --> 09:22.429
and that's why I won.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.965
Linzie was really
talented and beautiful.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.533
She would have won.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.602
But I got the scholarship,
and her life went to crap.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.604
She should have the great
life that I'm living,

09:30.704 --> 09:31.905
but instead, she's
living in a van,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.406
and she didn't even
get to come on down!

09:33.506 --> 09:35.308
Okay-- Oh, whoa.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.977
Um...

09:37.077 --> 09:40.380
Oh. We're out of ranch.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.182
Oh, have some of mine.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.618
Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.190
Dave, don't waste
that last carrot.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.459
Oh. (chuckles)

09:52.559 --> 09:56.697
Oh, hell no.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.332
Where's the little girls' room?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.968
Oh, it's right back there.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.640
Move. Gemma!

10:06.740 --> 10:08.776
That woman is a snake.
She is no good.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.577
Wait, why would you say that?

10:10.678 --> 10:13.313
Well, Dave said,
"I need more dip."

10:13.413 --> 10:16.817
And Linzie lifted her plate
and said, "Stick it in mine."

10:17.851 --> 10:19.586
That's not what she said.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.655
Well, that's what I heard.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.693
I'm sure Linzie didn't
mean anything by it.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.527
She's just sad and lost.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.629
Well...
Yeah. And I was out of dip.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.199
She had some.
What was I supposed to do?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.067
You walk your butt
into that kitchen,

10:34.167 --> 10:35.836
and you get the bottle.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.205
Or hell, you'd swallow
that celery dry.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.807
(scoffs)

10:39.907 --> 10:41.574
Back me up on this, Calvin.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.143
(chuckles):
Oh, believe me.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.846
I know better than to
ever go side-dipping.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.854
Okay, you're seeing the ball.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.756
You're bringing your bat back.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.257
Now let's freeze.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.592
Do you see anything wrong?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.194
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.096
Yeah, I-I see it.
Okay.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.732
My hat's crooked.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.000
Come on, Peter,
get serious.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.202
Hey.
Hey.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.071
Uh, Marty, this is Peter.
Peter, this is Marty.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.205
Oh, nice to meet you, man.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.974
We are breaking down
Peter's swing.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.477
Ah, yes,
physics in action.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.013
Rotational velocity is
translated into torque.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.648
The transfer of energy
from bat...

11:21.749 --> 11:23.216
(clicks tongue) ...to ball.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.119
Wow.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.988
Yeah, you'll have
to excuse my brother.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.723
He's a big-ass nerd.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.626
If being fluent in
Newton's second law of motion

11:33.727 --> 11:36.429
makes me a nerd...
(scoffs) ...so be it.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.032
I know that law.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.433
Force equals mass

11:40.533 --> 11:42.035
times acceleration.
Times acceleration.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.070
(chuckles):
Ah, yeah.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.505
(laughing)
Uh... huh.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.709
Never seen anyone
fist-bump science.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.046
Whoa, whoa, you work at JPL?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.915
Uh, yes, I do.
I'm an astrophysicist.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.751
Do you know anyone who worked
on the Perseverance Mars rover?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.319
(scoffs) Do I know anyone?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.621
Little boy, I am "anyone."

12:02.589 --> 12:05.358
I'm on the team that programmed
one of the telescoping claws.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.293
(laughs)

12:06.393 --> 12:07.494
Yo, I just touched the guy

12:07.594 --> 12:09.763
who touched the claw
that touched Mars.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.031
That's me.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.433
Yeah, all right,
all right, um, hey.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.069
Who wants to watch Peter
miss some curveballs?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.871
I'd love to,
but I got to calculate

12:17.971 --> 12:19.807
some launch telemetry.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.944
(chuckles) Wow.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.545
I mean,
your brother is so cool.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.115
(laughs)

12:29.316 --> 12:30.617
Do you think he'd show me
how to do that?

12:30.717 --> 12:33.086
Are you telling me
you would rather do math

12:33.186 --> 12:34.687
than work on your swing?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.556
Is that bad?

12:38.025 --> 12:41.228
Yeah, that-that-that
could be bad for me.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.797
Uh, sit down, man.
Let's talk.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.136
Peter, if you're gonna play
baseball at the next level,

12:49.236 --> 12:50.871
you have got to
want that more than

12:50.971 --> 12:52.205
you've ever wanted anything.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.541
You know, to have
a chance to make it,

12:54.641 --> 12:56.844
it has to mean
everything to you.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.911
Does it?

12:58.011 --> 13:00.280
It means everything
to my dad.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.715
I'm not asking our dad,
I'm asking you.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.586
Is baseball what you want
to do with your life?

13:07.487 --> 13:10.190
W-Well, it's in my top ten.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.792
Peter.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.794
It's number ten.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.399
Hey, guys.
Oh.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.168
Hey, Gemma,
what are you doing here?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.103
I was wondering,
do you have a tow truck?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.072
I'm trying to do
a favor for a friend.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.974
Wait a minute.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.211
Is this about that van that's
parked in front of your house?

13:32.279 --> 13:34.714
I know.
I know, but she...

13:34.814 --> 13:39.152
You let that snake stay
at your house!?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.054
I had to.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.755
Her transmission is busted.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.257
The AC doesn't work.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.993
She is miserable
in that van.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.061
The least I can do
is get it fixed.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
Gemma, you cannot blame yourself

13:49.997 --> 13:52.299
for how someone else's life
turned out.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.202
But I fake-cried
to win that pageant.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.437
I pride myself
on being a good person,

13:57.537 --> 13:58.906
but I'm just a cheater.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.742
Gemma, all you were doing
was playing the game.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.813
How many pageant winners have
actually delivered world peace?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.448
(scoffs)

14:10.217 --> 14:12.585
I mean it when I said it.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.187
I bet you did,

14:14.287 --> 14:16.589
because you had your eye
on the prize.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.425
Show her your
wall of fame, baby.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.859
Oh, yeah. Come on.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.231
Now, you see
all these awards?

14:25.365 --> 14:28.001
Sure. Best Auto Garage
in Southern California.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.436
Impressive.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.306
What's even more impressive is
that I made it myself.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.643
Don't get me wrong,
this is

14:36.743 --> 14:39.512
the best auto garage
in Southern California.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.515
You know, I deserved this award
I didn't actually get.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.553
Look, Gemma,
what's important is

14:46.653 --> 14:48.555
that you're a genuinely
good person.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.224
You got to let go of
this guilt about Linzie.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.694
Wait, is that Shaq

14:54.794 --> 14:56.529
giving you an award
at the White House?

14:56.629 --> 15:00.300
Oh, why, yes, it is. Yes.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.071
All right, Linzie.
Tow truck is on its way.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.273
You're gonna be on the road
and back to Hickory Corners

15:06.373 --> 15:09.342
in no time.
(sighs) Thank you, Dave.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.946
You have so much
positive energy, it's amazing.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.082
Well, thank you.
And look,

15:15.182 --> 15:16.984
you may not have won
on The Price is Right,

15:17.084 --> 15:18.918
but I have a feeling that you're
gonna win the Showcase Showdown

15:19.019 --> 15:20.053
of life.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.788
(chuckles softly)

15:21.888 --> 15:24.457
You know, when I first saw you
at the farmer's market,

15:24.557 --> 15:27.260
going to town
on those dough-nots...

15:28.261 --> 15:30.230
...I knew we'd end up
right here.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.298
What do you mean?

15:31.398 --> 15:33.133
Dave.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.735
Come on,
let's not play games.

15:35.835 --> 15:39.906
You dipped your celery
stick in my ranch.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.911
We both know what you wanted.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.613
Yes.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.981
Ranch.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.716
Uh...

15:49.816 --> 15:51.218
(chuckles)

15:51.318 --> 15:54.687
You see, Linzie, um,
celery, it has no taste.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.189
Without a dip,

15:56.289 --> 15:57.324
it's inedible.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.725
(chuckles) Come on.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.261
You got all up in that sauce.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.563
Huh. Uh, Linzie,

16:03.663 --> 16:06.199
I don't like this.
Whew, why am I excited?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.168
No, that's fear.
Dave, calm down!

16:08.268 --> 16:10.137
Shut up, you sexy man.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.504
Okay, Linzie.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.373
I'm flattered,
but you need to chill.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.275
I've got your dip right here.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.044
Ah! Okay. All right.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.747
(gasps) What the hell?!
Gemma, it's not what you think!

16:23.850 --> 16:24.951
You walked in

16:25.052 --> 16:27.187
on a sexy man trying
to be unsexy,

16:27.287 --> 16:28.988
and it is not working!

16:30.690 --> 16:32.425
Oh, my God.
I know.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.827
She has got
some crazy ideas about dips.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.829
I would never...
I am so relieved.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.665
You're-you're relieved?
Why are you relieved?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.533
Tina was right about you.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.169
You're a total snake.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.570
Me?

16:43.670 --> 16:47.274
Everybody knew you fake-cried
at that pageant.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.808
(scoffs)

16:48.908 --> 16:51.644
Oh, yeah? What about
your nip slip?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.780
Huh? We all knew
that was premeditated.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.050
"Oh, I dropped a spoon.
Whoopsie doodle."

16:57.150 --> 16:58.418
(blows raspberries)

17:02.355 --> 17:05.192
I got to say, this sounds
like one heck of a pageant.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.794
Yeah, okay. (sighs)

17:07.894 --> 17:09.496
We're done here.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.997
Linzie, I'm gonna tell you

17:11.098 --> 17:12.732
the same thing
your landlord told you.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.502
Get your crap and get out.

17:19.038 --> 17:19.939
Damn.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.541
Stop it.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.744
(door closes)

17:28.648 --> 17:31.451
I cannot believe that Linzie...

17:31.551 --> 17:34.421
was trying to hit this.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.823
I believe it.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.560
In Hickory Corners,
you're a ten.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.829
What does that make me in L.A.?

17:42.929 --> 17:44.797
My husband.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.401
I'm gonna need a number.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.972
Here's to the fathers

17:53.072 --> 17:54.207
and sons.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.475
Oh, and, uh,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.344
to how many cars you say
you own again?

17:57.444 --> 17:59.746
(both laughing)

17:59.846 --> 18:01.013
Yes, sir.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.216
Hey, there's my boy.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.418
And my favorite baseball coach.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.887
(laughs) Yeah,
you say that now.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.922
Uh... (coughs)

18:10.022 --> 18:11.291
Uh, sir.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.792
Your son has something
he wants to tell you,

18:12.892 --> 18:15.662
and I don't think
you're gonna like it.

18:16.463 --> 18:20.133
Then maybe he doesn't
need to say it.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.707
Dad.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.642
I don't want to play baseball.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.511
What?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.213
But you love baseball.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.081
Well, yeah, sort of, but...

18:35.182 --> 18:38.050
Oh, what-what Peter is saying
is that he...

18:38.151 --> 18:40.353
he just isn't passionate
about baseball,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.855
and he feels pressure to play.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.225
His real passion is for science.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.793
Maybe even astrophysics.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.262
What? That's not a career.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.167
I thought your son was gonna
help my son with his batting.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.402
Well, so did I, okay?

18:55.502 --> 18:56.403
Malcolm, what happened?

18:56.503 --> 18:58.004
Pop.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.739
Do you remember when you were
my Little League coach?

18:59.839 --> 19:02.141
A-And you pushed me
and inspired me to be my best?

19:02.242 --> 19:04.544
Yes, and that's what
you were supposed to do

19:04.644 --> 19:06.379
for Kenny's son.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.780
Do you remember

19:07.880 --> 19:09.081
when you were Marty's
Little League coach?

19:09.182 --> 19:12.051
And you pushed him
and inspired him,

19:12.151 --> 19:15.488
but he wasn't so into it,
and he sucked.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.958
Hey, man. "Sucked" is
a little extreme.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.793
(chuckles): Yeah.
He was terrible.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.296
Right. Marty was the worst.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.664
He fell down swinging.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.333
Every single time.
Every single time. Right.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.000
Dude, the bat was too heavy.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.670
(muttering)

19:30.770 --> 19:32.939
The point is, Pop,

19:33.039 --> 19:36.276
you saw what Marty was good at,
so you let him quit baseball.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.910
And for five summers,

19:38.010 --> 19:40.079
you drove him to science camp.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.113
And now look at him.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.115
He's happy,
he's successful.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.917
Everything worked out.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.354
That was the best thing
for Marty, and...

19:47.454 --> 19:49.989
I think that's gonna be
the best thing for Peter.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.191
It's what I want, Dad.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.228
You know what?

19:55.328 --> 19:57.464
You don't know
what the hell you're doing.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.432
You are a horrible coach.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Watch your tone.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.204
Now, Malcolm is talking about
what's best for Peter,

20:05.305 --> 20:06.573
not what's best for you.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.075
And, you know,
if that means you're gonna

20:09.175 --> 20:11.378
take your business
elsewhere, then so be it.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.980
I'm taking my cars
back Motor Boys.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.515
(scoffs)

20:15.615 --> 20:18.217
Well, you'll be
taking them back a lot.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.360
Hey, sorry I messed up
your big deal, Pop.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.629
Nah, don't be sorry,
Malcolm.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.030
It's only money.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.932
That I need.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.835
But you did the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.637
You boys want a drink?

20:37.737 --> 20:38.805
The good stuff?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.840
Yeah. (laughs)

20:40.940 --> 20:43.175
Oh, uh, Pop,
I am honored.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.877
You deserve it.

20:44.977 --> 20:45.878
(both exclaiming)

20:45.978 --> 20:47.447
Oh, hey, thanks, Daddy.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.248
Hey, you got any lemonade
I can mix this with?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.784
Oh! Or pineapple juice.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.886
Give-give me those back.

20:53.986 --> 20:54.921
What?

20:55.021 --> 20:55.955
Y'all ain't ready.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.790
