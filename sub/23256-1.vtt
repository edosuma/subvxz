WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.336
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:02.370 --> 00:05.073
- Juliette stole Maddie's song!

00:05.106 --> 00:07.275
I think I'm doomed
to make the same mistakes

00:07.308 --> 00:09.177
over and over again.

00:09.210 --> 00:13.047
- Don't call me later.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.748
I'm done trying.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.151
I'm done trying with you,
Scarlett.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.554
- Thank you.
- No problem.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.091
Sweetheart, I got you
and I got your sister.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.225
That's all I need.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.160
You take good care
of yourself, Deacon.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.461
You too, Jess.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.264
- Free.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.434
All right, girls!
Scarlett's pulling up!

00:33.467 --> 00:34.502
Come on down! Let's go!

00:34.535 --> 00:35.569
Coming, coming, coming.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.438
All right, picture time.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.806
All right, why do we
have to do this again?

00:38.839 --> 00:40.474
It's tradition!

00:40.508 --> 00:41.442
I thought the point was

00:41.475 --> 00:43.277
to take Christmas photos
before Christmas.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.279
Well, tradition
procrastinated. Let's go.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.380
Okay, we all set?

00:46.414 --> 00:47.581
We got one more
coming in right here.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.482
Can we do
the funny ones first?

00:48.516 --> 00:51.152
- No, we're not--
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.720
First New Year's resolution:

00:52.753 --> 00:54.855
Develop time management skills.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.424
- Yeah.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.392
Okay, get in there
nice and close, guys--good.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.660
Here we go.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.564
Great. All right, hold on.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.832
Oops, sorry. My phone.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.234
- What are you--no.
- One sec.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.601
I'm sorry.

01:08.369 --> 01:11.139
Hey, Bucky.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.674
Yeah, Christmas was awesome.
Thanks.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.510
What

01:16.544 --> 01:19.180
Yes, of course I'm interested.
I'll tell him right now.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.649
Thank you.
I'll see you Thursday. Goodbye.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.650
Dad?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.285
Bucky just got me on

01:24.318 --> 01:25.319
the Hits To End Hunger
Benefit in L.A.

01:25.353 --> 01:26.587
That's fantastic, baby.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.389
I will be playing
at the Staples Center, guys!

01:28.422 --> 01:30.191
- That's so cool.
- And then on New Year's Eve,

01:30.224 --> 01:32.193
MTV is throwing this,
like, street party.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.294
And they want me to go.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.296
- Sounds awesome.
- I know!

01:35.329 --> 01:37.598
- Yeah.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.136
What

01:42.170 --> 01:43.571
No, nothing.
I just thought we'd be

01:43.604 --> 01:45.773
spending New Year's Eve
together, that's all.

01:46.474 --> 01:50.144
It's the first year since--
since we...

01:50.178 --> 01:51.579
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's all right.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.780
- I'm call him back.
- No! It's okay!

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
Hey, it's a great cause.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.883
You're gonna have
a wonderful time. You go.

01:55.916 --> 01:56.717
Are you sure?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.786
I'm fine. Look at me.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.421
Come take a picture now.
Let's do this.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.590
- In here, guys.
- Uh-oh. Here we go.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.193
- You look good. Perfect.
- Okay.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.328
- Thank you.
- Right on.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.896
- He can't.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.664
- Maddie...
- I'm 18 now. I'm gonna be fine.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.566
Scarlett?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.835
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.437
Then get another valet!

02:16.470 --> 02:17.838
It's a New Year's Eve party...

02:17.871 --> 02:20.641
If I want to have 200 people,
I'm gonna have 200 people!

02:20.674 --> 02:22.610
It's about the champagne.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.878
I have told you guys
a million times!

02:24.912 --> 02:28.316
That the Brut Gold Champagne
is important, very important!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.918
Why? Because the bottle is gold!

02:30.951 --> 02:34.688
Do I need to find a new caterer?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.490
I think we should postpone.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.559
The kickoff of her
first tour in two years?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.828
Go tell her. Nice knowing you.
- I want the bottle.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.664
Just a little pre-show
jitters, she'll be fine.

02:43.697 --> 02:47.268
Find the cases I ordered
or I will ruin you!

02:51.305 --> 02:52.706
Did you give them the notes?

02:52.740 --> 02:53.907
Because this is not it!

02:53.941 --> 02:56.210
Juliette, it's great.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.978
You know what?
Everybody out!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.780
Please, everybody out!
I need a minute!

02:59.813 --> 03:01.815
All right, everybody.
10 minutes, please.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.358
All right, you ready, Blondie?
Here we go!

03:12.393 --> 03:16.630
Ha! And the crowd goes wild!

03:16.664 --> 03:18.232
That was a total foul.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.700
No way. Your feet were moving.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.402
Yes. You bulldozed me
to the ground.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.471
Oh, you're insane.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.440
You nervous about this gig?

03:26.474 --> 03:27.841
Trying not to think about it.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.009
I don't know, man.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.912
Charlie Mae's

03:31.945 --> 03:33.914
Maybe you should think about it.
- Yeah, shut up.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.350
I don't know why you're making
such a big deal out of this.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.520
'Cause the whole knows me
as part of a duo?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.323
I mean, how am I supposed
to do this by myself?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.425
Not to mention, I don't even
have a song list.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.427
Gunnar, you're the best
songwriter I know.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.296
Everything you play
is gonna be great.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.264
You know, Scarlett
and I were great.

03:50.298 --> 03:53.701
And without her, I've lost every
shred of creativity.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.670
I sincerely think
you've lost your mind.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.409
How's she doing anyway?

04:01.442 --> 04:02.543
Oh, she's fine,

04:02.576 --> 04:05.546
but none of that matters, man.
We need to work on you.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.480
We?

04:06.514 --> 04:09.550
Yeah. You're having
a tough time on stage.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.486
I'm great on stage.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.857
So...I'm gonna coach you.

04:16.890 --> 04:20.961
Mr. I Win By Fouling's
gonna coach me?

04:20.994 --> 04:22.663
Yeah.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.305
- Two minutes.
- Thank you.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.340
Juliette?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.575
Hey, we just want to wish you
the best of luck.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.076
It's gonna be great.
- Thank you.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.611
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

04:37.645 --> 04:41.081
Will?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.984
Hey, Zach! Good to see you.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.587
Same. You know Mark, right?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.622
- Yeah, of course, of course.
It's good to see you.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.891
You too.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.927
- Well, you look well.
- Thanks.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.064
Yeah. Well, we're gonna go
get some good seats, okay?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.599
So we'll see you.
- All right.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.701
We'll catch you--

05:01.569 --> 05:03.737
Doing okay?

05:03.771 --> 05:05.473
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:05.506 --> 05:10.511
Juliette! Juliette!

05:10.544 --> 05:12.880
Full house, no surprise.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.815
- You came.
- Of course, I came.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.350
You know, none of this
would have been possible

05:16.384 --> 05:18.486
if you hadn't given me
another chance.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.755
- Come on, now.
You go give 'em hell.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.524
Announcer: The moment you've
all been waiting for!

05:23.557 --> 05:25.526
Give it up for Juliette Barnes!

05:28.396 --> 05:30.631
I'm really feeling
the love in here tonight.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.833
Thank you, Nashville!

05:32.866 --> 05:35.769
- We love you!
- Nashville loves you!

05:41.875 --> 05:47.481
* I shout against the mountain

05:47.515 --> 05:57.425
* Nothing echoes back

05:57.458 --> 06:02.029
* Slipping

06:02.062 --> 06:11.405
* Like I'm climbing
up an avalanche *

06:11.439 --> 06:19.046
* Is there anybody out there

06:19.079 --> 06:23.383
* Is there anybody out there

06:30.190 --> 06:35.629
* Hold on

06:35.663 --> 06:43.704
* Falling into nothing

06:45.706 --> 06:46.774
Phony!

06:46.807 --> 06:49.109
* Hold on

06:52.012 --> 06:56.183
* Waiting

06:56.216 --> 06:59.753
* For someone

06:59.787 --> 07:03.023
* Is there anybody out there

07:03.056 --> 07:04.958
Boo! Get off the stage!

07:04.992 --> 07:07.628
Unoriginal!

07:07.661 --> 07:10.130
* Is there anybody out there

07:10.163 --> 07:13.467
Nobody likes you!

07:14.835 --> 07:15.736
Excuse me. You know,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.505
we're trying to put
on a show here, right?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
Go home!

07:19.072 --> 07:21.174
You go home.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.677
No, you're not just gonna stand
down there in the dark.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.746
And ruin the show
for everybody else.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.147
You're a fake!

07:27.180 --> 07:28.982
Fake?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.519
Oh, don't worry. I'm real.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.121
You have no idea how real I am.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.023
I'm being very real
up here onstage

07:36.056 --> 07:38.659
in front of thousands of people.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.862
- Juliette, we love you!

07:43.230 --> 07:46.934
People think that I don't know
that I have problems?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.737
If they had any idea,

07:49.770 --> 07:53.040
I want what everybody wants.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.809
I want people to love me.

07:55.843 --> 08:00.213
But that's just a trap
because they don't know me.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.050
I don't even want
them to know me.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.619
Because if they knew me,
they wouldn't love me.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.589
That's the story
of my whole life right there.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.891
Asking people for their love.

08:10.924 --> 08:16.063
You know what? I am tired.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.199
I think I just need to stop.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.069
Juliette! Juliette!

08:22.102 --> 08:25.739
I'm sorry.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.188
Well, now to last night's
Music City meltdown

08:41.221 --> 08:43.757
Juliette Barnes
went after concert goers

08:43.791 --> 08:47.094
after a few unhappy fans
began taunting and heckling

08:47.127 --> 08:48.295
the country super star.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.330
And what followed
was a five-minute rant

08:50.363 --> 08:52.065
about being loved.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.836
After which point, Juliette
abruptly ended the concert...

08:57.304 --> 09:00.974
What?

09:01.008 --> 09:04.144
Is there anything
you want to say to me?

09:04.177 --> 09:07.648
I think we should cancel
the New Year's Eve party.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.017
Anything else?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.885
What else is there?

09:11.919 --> 09:14.622
Then what is going on?

09:14.655 --> 09:15.989
Why won't you talk to me?

09:16.023 --> 09:19.760
Avery, what would you
like to hear me say?

09:19.793 --> 09:23.196
That the past two months of my
life have been a living hell?

09:23.230 --> 09:28.301
That every morning, it's a
struggle just get out of bed?

09:28.335 --> 09:31.805
Why would I
burden you with that?

09:31.839 --> 09:34.675
I just want to be left alone.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.344
Look...

09:38.378 --> 09:41.114
I'm here for you, okay?

09:41.148 --> 09:43.116
Maybe we should just
get away for a while?

09:46.820 --> 09:49.356
You did not have to bring
those over. Thank you.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.692
Well, I was in
the neighborhood, so...

09:51.725 --> 09:53.326
Liar. Come on.
I got to get a plane.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.995
Oh, L.A. sounds like fun.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.930
My first gig as a chaperone.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.031
Oh

09:58.065 --> 10:00.000
You can go instead of me.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.101
Hope you're getting paid.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.636
I most certainly am not.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.839
Oh. Speaking of gigs,
you working on anything new?

10:05.873 --> 10:08.241
Uh, just myself, actually.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.645
I'm trying to figure out what
the next chapter in life is.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.246
'Cause it's New Year's and I got
this little clock on my shoulder

10:13.280 --> 10:16.850
ticking away saying
do something or else.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.923
It's just another day.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.825
Yeah. You okay?

10:24.858 --> 10:27.327
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.398
I'm positive!

10:31.431 --> 10:32.733
How's Avery?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.868
He's just dealing
with a lot right now.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.871
I can only imagine.
I hope she's okay.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.372
How's, um...

10:39.406 --> 10:42.309
He's good.
He's got a gig coming up.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.344
Oh, good for him.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.979
We stopped talking, so...

10:46.013 --> 10:47.681
- Yeah, I know.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.917
Yeah.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.152
Like in passing
or matter of factly?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.421
What do I look like?
The postal service?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.189
Y'all want to know
so much about each other,

10:56.223 --> 10:57.891
one of you has got to
pick up the phone.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.426
Because this is not
in my job description.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.461
Okay, I'm sorry.
You're right.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.964
But you'd make
a very cute mailman.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.034
Justin Bieber, Sia,
Bruno Mars

11:07.067 --> 11:08.969
Daphne!

11:09.002 --> 11:10.704
- Oh, my God!

11:10.738 --> 11:12.205
Jonah Ford is playing
the concert?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.142
!

11:15.175 --> 11:17.410
Maddie, you're gonna
be in the same vicinity

11:17.444 --> 11:18.912
as Jonah Ford?

11:18.946 --> 11:19.947
Please don't have
a freak-out on my bed.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.283
No! I love him like so much!

11:23.316 --> 11:25.853
Did you know he broke up
with Mia Forster?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.387
I thought he just
did that movie with her.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.957
No, that bombed
and so did their relationship.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.324
Okay, well, that's none
of my business.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.726
And it's kind of rude.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.761
Hey, Maddie,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.963
you guys will be spending
quality time together.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.164
And it's New Year's!

11:37.197 --> 11:38.431
I do not need you

11:38.465 --> 11:40.167
being my matchmaker
right now, Daphne.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.735
I'm just trying to help.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.971
I'm thinking I should
come with you.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.206
I'm just going
for a couple of days.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.876
And it won't be so bad
to spend some time with Dad.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.044
He'll be okay, right?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.480
Yeah, totally. What about you?

11:53.513 --> 11:56.083
I mean, I'll miss you so much.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.450
- So much.
- Oh, my God, so much.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.318
So much!

11:58.351 --> 12:00.788
But I'll be fine.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.356
All right. Thank God.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.993
- Hi!
- Hello there!

12:06.026 --> 12:07.127
- I think so.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.396
Cool.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.864
Thank you for taking her.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.100
Cousinly duty. You okay?

12:13.133 --> 12:15.368
Yeah, just
taking care of things.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.439
Sure looks like it.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.343
Maddie, you coming?

12:23.844 --> 12:24.812
Hmm.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.379
Are you upset that
your New Year's Eve plans

12:26.413 --> 12:28.148
got foiled?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.350
No, I'm not.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.419
Just another day.
No big deal.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.387
You're the second person
to say that to me.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.856
Maybe that's 'cause it's true.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.257
Mm-hmm.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.792
Well, do you think you
could take this time

12:38.826 --> 12:40.961
to do something for you?

12:40.994 --> 12:42.495
- I am doing something for me.
- I ain't talking about reading.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.296
I know what
you're talking about.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.331
And I don't want to
talk about it.

12:44.364 --> 12:44.998
Okay, but don't you want
to see what it's like

12:45.032 --> 12:48.001
to maybe get back out there?

12:48.035 --> 12:51.204
What? And partake
in some stupid tradition

12:51.238 --> 12:52.105
like kissing somebody

12:52.139 --> 12:54.507
while a giant ball
descends from the sky?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.476
Yeah.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.279
Good Lord.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.182
What hotshot are you kissing?

13:02.850 --> 13:04.284
It ain't about me.
It's about you.

13:04.985 --> 13:05.986
- Mm-hmm.

13:06.019 --> 13:06.887
Yeah, well, me,
I'm a grown man.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.588
I don't need to follow
some sappy routine

13:08.621 --> 13:11.959
made popular in movies
and champagne commercials.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.293
You know how silly
that sounds?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.863
Scarlett, I'm very busy.
That's why I'm not going.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.130
I've got the disaster
with Juliette.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.532
I got Zach. I got budgets
I got to go over.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.501
Okay, okay. Fine.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.036
Thank you.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.304
How's Roosevelt?

13:24.337 --> 13:25.906
He's good.

13:25.939 --> 13:26.940
Still stubborn?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.083
Can't believe
we actually did it.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.250
So hard to leave her, though,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.987
even if we're only
three few hours away.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.223
Yeah, but a vacation
was long overdue.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.960
I can assure you, my parents
are smothering her with gifts.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.195
In fact, I should call them.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.863
Let them know we've arrived.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.464
I'm taking a nap.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.960
Trouble sleeping?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.995
I like the night myself.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.998
It's when I do my best thinking.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.468
I recognized you this morning.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.936
Thanks.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.205
I don't mean the fact
that you're a celebrity.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.273
What do you mean?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.674
What brings you here,
Ms. Barnes?

15:07.707 --> 15:10.043
Well, I'm writing a book
on hotel lounges.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.346
And the strange men
that occupy them.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.248
That's funny.
I'm writing a book too.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
On what?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.286
Journey to authenticity.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.289
I'm just here for vacation.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.058
It's complicated.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.659
Such is life, right?

15:26.693 --> 15:29.662
Complications are just
excuses to avoid the truth.

15:29.696 --> 15:33.200
Phew. That's deep.

15:33.233 --> 15:37.437
Sarcasm is the last resort
of the fearful.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.707
And now we can just end
this conversation right here.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.710
Your choice.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.446
Who are you?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.516
I am someone on
your journey perhaps.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.683
What journey is that?

15:50.717 --> 15:52.652
That is the question,
isn't it?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.022
I've always believed
you have to give up control

15:55.055 --> 15:56.323
in order to get control.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.359
Hmm. And who asked you?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.428
Have a Happy New Year,
Ms. Barnes.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.308
* Sometimes it gets
to be too much *

16:15.342 --> 16:20.513
* This kind of loving
make you crazy *

16:22.582 --> 16:26.453
* But when I'm standing
on the edge about to jump *

16:26.486 --> 16:29.656
* It always saves me

16:29.689 --> 16:32.325
* It's crazy

16:32.359 --> 16:35.328
* Good love

16:35.362 --> 16:42.369
* It don't come easy

16:42.402 --> 16:46.239
- Woo!
- Yeah!

16:47.207 --> 16:49.509
Hey, Gunnar.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.213
What's up?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.615
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

16:55.648 --> 16:56.783
What are you talking about?

16:56.816 --> 17:00.653
This is not a competition, man.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.123
All that moving around,
showmanship,

17:03.156 --> 17:04.591
that's just--
that's a cover.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.294
People come to my show for
a different kind of feeling.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.695
So I have to do what I do.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.531
Because I don't
connect like you do.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.566
You had no problem when you were
up onstage with me last week

17:13.600 --> 17:15.602
goofing around on my song,
right?

17:15.635 --> 17:16.703
- Yeah, well...
- So just imagine

17:16.736 --> 17:20.573
I'm up there with you.
And we're doing the same thing.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.345
Naked.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.551
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe

17:31.584 --> 17:33.820
Can I do this?
- You can, gonna be great.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.796
Who the hell is that?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.698
That's Jonah Ford.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.734
Should I know that name?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.336
Let's just figure out
where I need to be.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.270
Yeah.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.546
Jonah! Jonah!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.214
Break a leg, baby.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.851
Everybody put your hands
together for Jonah Ford!

18:07.787 --> 18:10.557
What is up, L.A.?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.825
Is everyone having
an amazing night?

18:13.393 --> 18:16.529
How about we keep it going
with this next artist?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.198
A personal favorite of mine,

18:18.231 --> 18:21.868
please give it up
for Maddie Jaymes!

18:38.851 --> 18:43.156
* All the fear in my bones

18:43.190 --> 18:47.394
* Voices drag me down

18:47.427 --> 18:51.731
* Haunted by my ghosts

18:51.764 --> 18:54.667
* Circles round and round

18:54.701 --> 18:56.836
* And feeling my demons

18:56.869 --> 19:01.374
* Go ahead and break apart
this coat of armor *

19:01.408 --> 19:05.712
* Feeds off the hurt and scars
makes me stronger *

19:05.745 --> 19:09.849
* It's blood and veins
but it gives me the strength *

19:09.882 --> 19:12.952
* This heart can
take all the pain *

19:12.985 --> 19:16.856
* It's what it's made for

19:18.325 --> 19:22.495
* Feel the fire in my chest

19:22.529 --> 19:26.533
* Let it burn
Let it spread *

19:26.566 --> 19:30.970
* Comes alive
Ash to ash *

19:31.003 --> 19:33.573
* It goes round and round

19:33.606 --> 19:36.376
* And embracing my demons

19:36.409 --> 19:39.279
* This heart can
take all the pain *

19:39.312 --> 19:42.482
* It's what it's made for

19:43.550 --> 19:46.453
* It's what it's made for

19:52.459 --> 19:54.361
At first, I couldn't hear
anything in my ears.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.564
And I was convinced the entire
arena could see me sweating.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.266
You were amazing
and beautiful and perfect.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.267
Thank you, thank you.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.302
I totally agree.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.238
Hey, I'm Jonah.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.105
Maddie.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.707
- Nice to meet you.
- Scarlett. Hi.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.975
Hi. I know. I'm a big fan.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.310
Oh, thank you.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.679
I was worried with
the whole short notice

20:12.712 --> 20:13.980
that you wouldn't
be able to make it.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.349
But I'm glad it all worked out.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.784
So this was your doing?

20:17.817 --> 20:20.353
I heard your EP.
It's super raw and honest.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.655
Really hard to find
that kind of truth in music.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.956
Well, thank you.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.658
I promised my sister
I would tell you

20:25.692 --> 20:27.360
that she is your
biggest fan.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.362
- Ever, yes.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.030
What about you?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.600
Um, I loved the movie.
I thought you were amazing.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.435
You and Mia were like perfect.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.869
Yeah, well, things onscreen

20:36.903 --> 20:39.506
are a lot different
than they are in real life.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.773
So how long are you here for?

20:40.807 --> 20:41.841
Two more days?

20:41.874 --> 20:44.777
Why don't you
give me your number

20:44.811 --> 20:45.978
so you can come with us
to the studio tomorrow?

20:48.315 --> 20:50.317
Are you serious?
I love them.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.518
Well, we're laying down
something together.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.453
I'd be real cool
to hang out.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.388
Totally. Well, now you
know where to find me.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.989
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.693
- Um...yeah.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.928
Lucky me.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.830
Gotta go, but it was great
to meet you guys.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.264
Nice to meet you.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.404
How many people does it take

21:11.438 --> 21:12.839
to make one person
feel important?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.407
Okay, I think it's so cute.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.008
Slightly self-indulgent.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.877
- You're my entourage.
- Watch it.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.646
Okay. Either way,
it's adorable.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.047
Ehh...

21:21.080 --> 21:22.582
- Ehh.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.962
And his approach in honesty,

21:35.995 --> 21:37.564
many devout followers say,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.666
is what they love
most about him.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.702
Tell me what you're scared of.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.836
That I can't be loved.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.572
Why are you scared
you can't be loved?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.074
'Cause I have
no control of my life.

21:48.107 --> 21:51.644
And how do we get
control of our lives?

21:51.678 --> 21:53.980
How do we take control
of these addictions?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.782
Because we all have them.

21:55.815 --> 22:01.588
Whether that's drugs, alcohol,
sex, money, attention.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.424
Celebrity, right?

22:04.457 --> 22:07.660
There's an addict inside
every single one of us.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.997
And if we want to close the door
on our addictions,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.833
then we have got to be willing
to open another door.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.403
What is that door?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.804
It's our secret pain.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.139
The despair that each
of us has carried with us

22:20.172 --> 22:21.741
since we were children.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.545
We would do anything not
to open that door, right?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.714
But we will help you
open that door.

22:27.747 --> 22:31.751
We will help you make
your own hero's journey

22:31.784 --> 22:35.922
like Alice through
the Looking Glass.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.124
You have to give up control
to get control.

22:46.633 --> 22:51.103
* Tread is wearing thin

22:51.137 --> 22:55.408
* Everything is familiar

22:55.442 --> 23:00.747
* But I don't know who I am

23:01.814 --> 23:06.686
* Do you know where
you're goin' *

23:06.719 --> 23:12.825
* Don't even know
where I've been *

23:21.067 --> 23:24.837
- Nothing.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.847
Sweetie,
you're freaking me out.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.215
Are you lonely?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.550
Why would you ask me that?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.852
I don't know.
It's almost New Year's.

23:39.886 --> 23:40.720
Everyone has plans

23:40.753 --> 23:42.489
and it's your first year
without Mom.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.223
That's very sweet.
But I promise you

23:44.256 --> 23:46.826
that I'm gonna be fine
right here.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.796
Just me and my book.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.163
Now go away.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.472
Hello?
How's La

23:59.506 --> 24:02.208
Hi. It's good.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.078
I almost did something
real stupid.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.514
So you getting a tattoo?

24:07.547 --> 24:11.083
No. Worse.
Nearly called Gunnar.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.219
Instead, I deleted him
from my Favorites.

24:13.252 --> 24:19.959
So you're my new number one.
Congratulations.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.995
It's an honor.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.532
Sorry.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.700
Elaina Smith wants
Juliette to come on

24:27.734 --> 24:29.702
and tell her side of the story.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.103
You think that's a good idea?

24:31.137 --> 24:35.074
At this point, I think
anything's better than silence.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.010
Hey You heard the name
Darius Enright?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.546
That guy from TV?

24:39.579 --> 24:41.080
Yeah. He left me
a message last night.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.949
He wanted to get in touch
with Juliette.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.286
What time did he call?

24:47.319 --> 24:48.955
The middle of the night,
I think.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.824
Well, here, look. 2:02 a.m.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.494
Can I see that?

24:56.596 --> 24:58.197
Everything okay?

24:58.230 --> 25:02.201
Yeah. Just an odd coincidence.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.281
Hey, guys. Where's Jonah?

25:15.314 --> 25:17.984
Oh, yeah.
The bastard bailed on us.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.552
Yeah, he said
he couldn't make it.

25:19.586 --> 25:24.123
Said he was gonna come
by tomorrow instead.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.658
Uh, what about LANY?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.727
I mean, they left
when he didn't show.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.928
Oh.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.163
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.799
Oh, hey. When you do see him,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.735
could you tell him
he owes me $50?

25:58.257 --> 26:00.727
- Hi. This is Glenn Goodman.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.794
I represent Juliette Barnes.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.931
I know who you are.
May I speak with her, please?

26:09.802 --> 26:11.303
This is Juliette.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.972
Is there anyone else
on the line?

26:13.005 --> 26:15.074
What were you doing
at that hotel?

26:15.107 --> 26:16.943
And hello to you too.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.878
Were you following me?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.713
You believe in fate?

26:20.747 --> 26:22.782
I believe in stalkers.

26:22.815 --> 26:26.018
You often return phone calls
from your stalkers?

26:26.052 --> 26:28.755
So you're telling me
it was just some coincidence?

26:28.788 --> 26:31.758
A coincidence is
a concurrence of events

26:31.791 --> 26:34.060
without apparent
causal connection.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.362
Our meeting was no coincidence.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.665
What is our connection?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.299
You need my help.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.803
Wh--how do you know
what I need?

26:43.836 --> 26:44.804
I told you

26:44.837 --> 26:47.206
what I recognized in you
wasn't your celebrity.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.908
What was it?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.144
Your pain.
I saw someone in need.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.715
I followed my instincts
and I was right.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.117
What do you want from me?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.753
I want to help you
change your life.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.027
I'm still surprised
you took her back.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.062
I told you, Juliette and I
go way back, all right?

27:10.096 --> 27:11.931
So she put her career
on the line

27:11.964 --> 27:13.399
to make things right.
There's a--

27:13.432 --> 27:15.968
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.771
Over the years, I've needed
a lot of forgiveness myself.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.673
Well, it was a hell
of welcome back performance.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.108
We're not gonna talk about
that right now, though, are we?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.810
No, we're gonna
keep it positive.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.178
We're gonna talk about different
things like New Year's.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.147
- No, no.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.215
You can't be alone
on New Year's, man.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.685
- Please, not you too, Zach.

27:32.719 --> 27:33.820
Scarlett and the girls
are wearing me out

27:33.853 --> 27:36.689
with this not so settled
concern over my New Year's.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.090
And?

27:38.124 --> 27:40.893
And it's clear they're not
just talking about New Year's.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.328
And you?
Are you thinking about it?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.296
- Zach...
- Deacon, women in this city

27:44.330 --> 27:46.298
would line up if you
got back out there, man.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.035
That's terrifying.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.771
Well, you realize how easy it
is these days to meet people?

27:51.804 --> 27:56.175
Really? 'Cause it seems
kind of complicated.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.378
All this match.dot whatever
and Timber...

27:59.411 --> 28:01.380
Tinder.
Timber is for lumberjacks.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.151
Speaking of swiping left...

28:05.184 --> 28:08.888
Well, if it isn't the ghost
of music past and music future.

28:08.921 --> 28:13.159
Hey, how's Driveway 65 doing?

28:13.192 --> 28:14.026
What do you want, Brad?

28:14.060 --> 28:16.195
I just wanted to offer
my condolences

28:16.228 --> 28:19.265
on Juliette's meltdown.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.167
That was quite
a show she put on.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.769
I can't say I blame her.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.036
I mean, I'd be
a few shades crazy

28:24.070 --> 28:26.238
if I had you guys
running things too.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.339
Look at that over there.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.075
She's waving at you,
by the way.

28:29.108 --> 28:29.942
She wants to meet you.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.277
I told her I don't why
she's obsessing

28:31.310 --> 28:34.280
over some dinosaur, right?

28:34.313 --> 28:36.749
But they want what they want.
- Apparently.

28:36.783 --> 28:37.649
It would mean the world

28:37.683 --> 28:38.885
if you could come over
and say hi later.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.888
Come on.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.790
- Yeah, I'll stop by.
- That's my boy.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.458
Merry Christmas,
there, Zacharoni.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.327
You are not rich enough
to call me that.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.163
Saul, I see you sitting there.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.265
Don't try and pretend
you aren't here.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.835
Good God, that guy's a tool.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.970
Can I try yours?

28:58.004 --> 28:59.939
- Mm-hmm. I'm trying yours.
- Okay.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.441
God, I hate this year already.
And it hasn't even started.

29:02.474 --> 29:06.045
Tell me about it.
Oh, damn.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.179
Do you miss him?

29:07.213 --> 29:12.819
Nope. I miss me.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.421
We're a pair.
Like Jonah Ford would

29:15.454 --> 29:17.456
ever actually want
to hang out with me anyway.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.993
Oh, please.
He should be so lucky.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.330
Can we just go home?

29:25.231 --> 29:29.135
* I wanna know
what it feels like *

29:29.168 --> 29:34.807
* To never come back again

29:34.841 --> 29:39.145
* I wanna feel the waves

29:39.178 --> 29:43.816
* Crushing down
on the heartache... *

29:43.850 --> 29:46.485
You know, guys,
can we just take five?

29:46.518 --> 29:48.187
Is that all right?

29:53.092 --> 29:54.827
Why can't I get over this?

29:54.861 --> 29:55.928
Well, do you even
know what it is

29:55.962 --> 29:57.363
you're trying to get over?

29:57.396 --> 29:58.564
I mean, when I came
back from Texas,

29:58.597 --> 30:03.369
I was so sure of myself.
And now it's gone.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.904
It's not gone.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.538
Listen, we risk everything
every time we stand

30:06.572 --> 30:09.976
on that stage.
That's the job.

30:10.009 --> 30:13.179
We pour our heart and soul
out into the unknown.

30:13.212 --> 30:17.516
No matter how humiliating
or terrifying it might be.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.119
That's what we do.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.022
You practice that?

30:23.055 --> 30:23.923
You're the one that told me

30:23.956 --> 30:26.525
I should get in touch
with my feelings.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.027
But I'm not even sure
I'm the guy you should be

30:28.060 --> 30:31.097
talking to about confidence.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.866
What do you mean?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.501
Nothing.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.537
What?

30:38.570 --> 30:43.475
I saw Zach and
perfect Mark the other night.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.912
It was like I got punched.

30:45.945 --> 30:46.946
Man, I'm sorry.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.014
I just--I still
don't get it.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.281
I mean, why couldn't
he forgive me

30:49.315 --> 30:51.583
for defending my friends?

30:51.617 --> 30:54.353
I apologized like 14 times.
What else could I do?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.322
I mean, how many
times did I try

30:56.355 --> 30:59.625
and win Scarlett back, huh?

31:00.492 --> 31:04.463
We're pathetic.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.493
And what am I supposed to do?

31:34.526 --> 31:35.527
You wait.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.551
The Great She Bible.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.654
It's one of the most important
monuments of English literature.

32:02.688 --> 32:07.293
Published sometime
between 1611 and 1613.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.061
Is it a copy?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.331
Have a seat.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.602
It's called the "She" version

32:16.635 --> 32:21.607
because there's a misprint
in the Book of Ruth, 3:15.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.774
"And when she held it,

32:22.808 --> 32:25.577
"he measured six measures
of barley and laid it on her.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.580
And she went into the city."

32:28.614 --> 32:30.282
Is this supposed
to impress me?

32:30.316 --> 32:32.051
No. Just fascinates me

32:32.084 --> 32:37.056
that even the greatest works
have faults.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.391
It's the essence of being human.

32:39.425 --> 32:40.993
So what am I doing here?

32:41.027 --> 32:42.328
You tell me.

32:42.361 --> 32:45.397
My manager said you're
running some sort of a cult.

32:45.431 --> 32:46.598
Your manager's misinformed.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.568
This is not a cult
nor a religion.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.203
It's about training the mind.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.373
Okay, So you're
a motivational speaker?

32:54.406 --> 32:57.343
I don't motivate.
I ask questions.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.678
I ask if there's a way
you can see yourself

32:59.711 --> 33:02.248
so you can begin to trust
who you really are.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.682
You said it yourself
at your concert.

33:03.715 --> 33:08.387
You want to stop asking
others for their love.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.490
That's all fame is,
a Band-Aid of love by millions.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.492
There one night
and gone the next.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.461
Love has brought you
into the state of being

33:15.494 --> 33:18.164
that you find
yourself right now.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.100
What state's that?

33:21.133 --> 33:22.701
Lost.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.607
Are you a good mother?

33:28.640 --> 33:32.344
I don't have
to answer that question.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.481
Yes, I'm a damn good mother.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.649
Next time before
you answer the question,

33:37.683 --> 33:42.020
I want you to shut your eyes.
And count to 10.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.257
Are you a good mother?

33:58.737 --> 34:02.508
When you start being authentic,
you begin to make progress.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.110
Look inside yourself.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.812
You have the power
to be so strong.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.680
This love you've
become so accustomed

34:08.714 --> 34:11.417
to chasing
your whole life is...

34:11.450 --> 34:13.252
fake power of celebrity.

34:13.285 --> 34:16.355
It's diminishing
your authentic power within.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.491
There's so much work to be done.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.527
I want you to join us.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.661
What does that mean?

34:22.694 --> 34:25.297
It means you have
a homework assignment.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.699
Next time you feel reactive...

34:27.733 --> 34:28.800
Reactive?

34:28.834 --> 34:30.569
Your first response
when threatened

34:30.602 --> 34:32.504
is aggression and anger.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.373
That's just means
of suppressing

34:34.406 --> 34:36.642
your real feeling,
which is fear.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.778
Only when you access the fear
can you learn to control it.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.880
Next time you feel the anger,

34:41.913 --> 34:45.251
I want you to count to 10.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.520
Feel the pain instead.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.356
And then what?

34:50.389 --> 34:52.591
You'll be ready
for the next step.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.561
You have to give up control
in order to get control.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.669
Maddie: I need a nap
and some fried chicken.

35:03.702 --> 35:04.803
Juliette: Right there with you.

35:04.836 --> 35:08.874
Maddie? Hey

35:08.907 --> 35:10.142
Hi.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.777
I'm sorry about yesterday.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.379
And I got you these.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.581
- Thank you.
- Let me make it up to you.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.316
Can I take you home?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.251
- Yeah.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.187
You're gonna like fly me home?

35:21.220 --> 35:24.456
Well, actually,
my pilot will, yeah.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.159
But only if you
have dinner with me.

35:28.694 --> 35:31.263
I would love that, yeah.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.432
All right, don't go anywhere.
Because coming up next,

35:33.465 --> 35:35.701
one of my favorite ladies
in country music,

35:35.734 --> 35:38.537
Juliette Barnes is gonna
be here in studio.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.438
Stick around.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.472
Remember, it's no big deal.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.874
So you got a little stressed.
You had a bad day.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.711
You're Juliette Barnes.
What's a little drama?

35:45.744 --> 35:46.878
Babe, you'll be fine.

35:46.912 --> 35:47.946
We're back and here with us

35:47.979 --> 35:51.950
fresh off her onstage meltdown
is Juliette Barnes.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.485
Girl, let's play nice.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.655
Is it safe to call you
the Kanye of country?

35:56.688 --> 35:58.624
What you might
call a meltdown,

35:58.657 --> 36:01.460
I call a moment
of authenticity.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.928
That's putting it lightly.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.263
So what happened?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.232
You saw some negative signs?

36:06.265 --> 36:07.899
You heard people yelling?

36:07.933 --> 36:10.236
I deal with that every day.
Why snap?

36:10.269 --> 36:11.703
I was just having a rough one.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.472
Any truth to the rumors
of you drinking again?

36:13.505 --> 36:14.840
Absolutely not. Just rumors.

36:14.873 --> 36:18.277
And what about your
relationship with Maddie James?

36:18.310 --> 36:18.977
What about it?

36:19.010 --> 36:22.414
Juliette, you stole her song.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.582
What did that do
to your relationship

36:23.615 --> 36:24.716
with Deacon Claybourne?

36:24.750 --> 36:28.554
And what about Highway 65?
What's going on there now?

36:28.587 --> 36:31.823
Just saying,
this town doesn't forget.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.525
All right, I want to open
this up to callers.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.561
Any Juliette Barnes fans
still out there,

36:35.594 --> 36:36.795
we want to hear from you.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.531
Hi, Elaina.
I'm sorry, but I'm done.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.234
It's just not right
what happened with Maddie.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.669
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.572
I don't even see how you can
show your face again after that.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.006
Well, you know what? Things...

36:48.039 --> 36:49.908
I think we've all
just had enough.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.878
You know, if I could just
say something for a minute.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.815
I don't understand
how you guys...

37:01.320 --> 37:06.325
One...two...

37:12.030 --> 37:17.303
Juliette?

37:17.336 --> 37:21.540
I struggle with depression.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.310
And it's been really bad lately.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.044
There might be a lot of
listeners out there

37:26.077 --> 37:28.814
who understand
what that feels like.

37:31.717 --> 37:37.556
And I'm trying...trying
to get it under control.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.761
And I'm gonna put my tour
on hold until that happens.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.464
Uh, okay.
You heard it here first.

37:45.497 --> 37:48.500
The Thicker Than Water tour
has been postponed.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.569
Up next, big trouble
in Little Big Town.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.405
We've got the latest scoop
for you after these messages.

37:55.073 --> 37:58.009
All right, folks! Yeah!

37:58.043 --> 38:02.548
It's almost midnight!

38:02.581 --> 38:04.383
Let's welcome to the stage
your next performer.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.486
You know him as the taller
half of the Exes.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.721
Please welcome Gunnar Scott!

38:15.694 --> 38:19.831
Hey, everyone.
It's great to be here.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.000
I hope you like what we have
to play for y'all tonight.

38:27.373 --> 38:31.710
* I wanna see the world

38:31.743 --> 38:36.482
* I wanna sail the ocean

38:36.515 --> 38:40.552
* I wanna know what
it feels like *

38:40.586 --> 38:44.790
* To never come back again

38:55.501 --> 38:59.538
* I wanna find the key
to the sky *

38:59.571 --> 39:04.776
* And never come back again

39:04.810 --> 39:09.515
* I wanna wake my soul

39:09.548 --> 39:14.486
* Climb the highest mountain

39:14.520 --> 39:18.156
* I wanna write my name
in the clouds *

39:18.189 --> 39:21.793
* And never come back again

39:22.928 --> 39:27.966
* Oh oh

39:27.999 --> 39:31.637
* Oh oh oh

39:42.581 --> 39:47.085
* I wanna find my love

39:47.118 --> 39:51.957
* Lose myself in passion

39:51.990 --> 39:55.794
* I wanna love her in my heart

39:55.827 --> 40:00.832
* And never come back again

40:00.866 --> 40:05.904
* I wanna ease my mind

40:05.937 --> 40:10.776
* Of all the doubt
that haunts it *

40:10.809 --> 40:14.546
* I wanna run out in the light

40:14.580 --> 40:18.416
* And never come back again

40:20.586 --> 40:24.823
* I wanna see those stars

40:24.856 --> 40:29.628
* Shining down from heaven

40:29.661 --> 40:33.164
* I wanna know what
it feels like *

40:33.198 --> 40:36.835
* To never come back again

40:38.904 --> 40:42.774
* I wanna know it feels like

40:42.808 --> 40:47.112
* To never come back again

40:54.219 --> 40:56.622
Okay, people! Here we go!

40:56.655 --> 40:59.658
Ten, nine, eight,

40:59.691 --> 41:03.194
seven, six, five,

41:03.228 --> 41:08.700
four, three, two, one!

41:09.000 --> 41:17.242
Happy New Year!

41:17.275 --> 41:21.680
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, baby!

41:21.713 --> 41:23.615
Happy New Year,
my sweet girl.

41:24.783 --> 41:27.252
- Look at that.
- Happy New Year, baby.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.657
All right, come here.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.027
You coming?

41:36.061 --> 41:37.863
Yeah. I'll be
right behind you.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.713
Yes?

41:57.983 --> 42:00.752
I'm ready.
