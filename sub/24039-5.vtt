00:00.375 --> 00:01.976
<i>Previously on "The Arrangement"...</i>

00:02.001 --> 00:03.033
"Kill Plan."

00:03.058 --> 00:04.223
Let's talk about this movie.

00:04.375 --> 00:05.862
This... this is new territory.

00:05.862 --> 00:07.476
You've never had a film lose money before.

00:07.561 --> 00:08.727
We should prepare.

00:08.795 --> 00:10.462
Maybe go back to morning sessions.

00:10.530 --> 00:11.629
So where do you fit in?

00:11.698 --> 00:12.964
We're gonna make you an icon.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.846
<i>Your mom was a wonderful woman.</i>

00:15.334 --> 00:16.663
<i>She meant a lot to me.</i>

00:16.663 --> 00:18.229
If you need anything, please...

00:18.298 --> 00:19.677
My door's always open.

00:20.707 --> 00:22.106
Oh, whoa, Wes. Whoa.

00:22.175 --> 00:23.441
That's not where I was going with this.

00:23.509 --> 00:24.942
We'd be great parents.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.044
Structured, focused, affectionate.

00:27.113 --> 00:30.381
<i>Please welcome
the incredible Xavier Hughes.</i>

00:30.450 --> 00:32.316
That's my boyfriend.

00:32.384 --> 00:33.928
Have you ever acted before?

00:34.821 --> 00:36.454
He has something undeniable, though.

00:36.522 --> 00:38.478
<i>A whole lot of buzz right now.</i>

00:39.292 --> 00:40.591
I thought you were on my side.

00:40.660 --> 00:42.360
I think I need to take a step back.

00:42.428 --> 00:44.662
You're looking for dirt on IHM, yeah?

00:44.731 --> 00:47.105
Man, I've got stories that
will make your blood run cold.

00:47.533 --> 00:49.819
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:50.737 --> 00:52.436
What's up, guys? I'm Erin Lim.

00:52.505 --> 00:54.372
And you're watching "The Rundown."

00:54.440 --> 00:56.040
<i>We all know Kyle West kills
it in the looks department.</i>

00:56.109 --> 00:57.608
But for the first time in his career,

00:57.677 --> 00:59.310
he's got a flop on his hands.

00:59.379 --> 01:01.145
<i>His movie "The Kill Plan" is so</i>

01:01.214 --> 01:02.871
not killing it at the box office.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.036
Let's break it down.

01:04.061 --> 01:06.061
<i>For starters, after
demanding final approval</i>

01:06.086 --> 01:07.551
on basically everything,

01:07.551 --> 01:10.091
<i>Kyle cast his real life
and real unknown girlfriend</i>

01:10.116 --> 01:11.099
<i>Megan Morrison.</i>

01:11.099 --> 01:13.122
<i>Then he had to recast
her with Amelia Briggs.</i>

01:13.147 --> 01:14.913
Because, uh, nudes.

01:14.982 --> 01:16.682
Sounds like trouble in Kyanastan.

01:16.750 --> 01:20.519
Oh, and the little issue of
going 45 million over budget.

01:20.587 --> 01:22.254
80 million. 125 million.

01:22.323 --> 01:24.089
Whatever. It's only money.

01:24.158 --> 01:26.397
Except that "Kill Plan"
only made 11 million

01:26.397 --> 01:27.915
<i>in its opening weekend.</i>

01:27.915 --> 01:30.453
<i>I hate math as much as anyone,
but that's problematic.</i>

01:30.478 --> 01:33.246
<i>And then the critics started
throwing some serious shade.</i>

01:33.315 --> 01:34.747
<i>"Unwatchable." "Mind-numbing."</i>

01:34.816 --> 01:37.798
<i>"So bad." Ow, man. That hurt.</i>

01:37.975 --> 01:39.275
<i>I guess this is what you get</i>

01:39.343 --> 01:40.784
<i>when you demand creative control.</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:41.948
<i>So, Kyle, what have we learned?</i>

01:41.948 --> 01:43.615
<i>First of all, stay beautiful always.</i>

01:43.683 --> 01:45.283
<i>And next time, maybe
stay in your lane, too?</i>

01:45.352 --> 01:46.918
<i>Oh, but wait... You're
directing a movie...</i>

01:46.987 --> 01:49.265
It's like a train wreck.
You can't look away.

01:49.482 --> 01:52.875
Oh, it's just information.
Helps me plan for the future.

01:58.299 --> 01:59.699
Can we pretend it never happened?

01:59.768 --> 02:01.004
Just for a few hours.

02:01.636 --> 02:03.069
I want to make tonight perfect.

02:09.744 --> 02:11.210
This is too good.

02:13.681 --> 02:15.204
Be careful of my dress.

02:16.751 --> 02:20.820
<i>♪
Reckless souls ♪</i>

02:25.326 --> 02:27.160
Kyle, how do you bounce back

02:27.228 --> 02:29.061
from a failure like the "Kill
Plan"? What's your next role?

02:29.130 --> 02:30.963
I honestly haven't given
much thought to acting.

02:31.032 --> 02:33.172
I'm just keeping my focus on
directing this amazing actress.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.234
- Kyle, Megan, look over here!
- Kyle!

02:35.259 --> 02:37.786
Oh-ho, there's a fan poll on Dark Horizons

02:37.829 --> 02:39.662
for who should be the next Agent Jane.

02:39.731 --> 02:41.297
I'm number three.

02:41.366 --> 02:43.310
How do they know I'm even up for the part?

02:43.389 --> 02:45.389
Creative Partners, earning their 10%.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.026
I am a huge Agent Jane fan.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.336
You make the perfect avenging angel.

02:51.230 --> 02:53.022
- They're in the back.
- Thanks, Zach.

02:57.303 --> 03:00.006
- What's he doing here?
- A little coordination.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.884
I actually knew right
away she wasn't an actress.

03:16.222 --> 03:17.921
'Cause you weren't needy and insecure?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.425
No, I was totally needy and insecure.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.791
I was producing my first film

03:20.860 --> 03:22.025
and I had no idea what I was doing.

03:22.094 --> 03:23.666
But she knew who she was.

03:23.929 --> 03:25.557
I knew who I wanted to be.

03:26.117 --> 03:29.922
And I knew that Terence's class
was full of untapped talent.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.569
- Were you there?
- It was before my time.

03:32.638 --> 03:34.505
If you can imagine a time without me.

03:34.573 --> 03:36.974
And DeAnn was seeing someone
else, if you can imagine that.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.136
But Terence was too irresistible.

03:42.715 --> 03:44.936
He had a way of seeing
his students with such...

03:45.818 --> 03:46.953
clarity.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.653
Then he just transformed them.

03:49.722 --> 03:51.025
In a matter of minutes.

03:52.458 --> 03:55.449
Hey. Why don't we toast
to the birthday girl.

03:57.242 --> 04:00.086
- To my lovely wife.
- Thank you.

04:00.332 --> 04:02.042
Happy birthday.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.502
That was a nice story,
how you and Terence met.

04:09.174 --> 04:12.370
Oh, we were just kids.
It was all very innocent.

04:13.279 --> 04:14.912
But it's clear you still love each other.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.409
You can totally see it.

04:17.149 --> 04:18.983
What you see is diplomacy.

04:19.785 --> 04:20.868
Diplomacy?

04:22.888 --> 04:24.631
You know what? I should stop talking.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.360
I'm a little drunk.

04:26.635 --> 04:29.190
God, I never used to be
this much of a lightweight.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.181
Marriage is

04:32.579 --> 04:34.481
a series of negotiations.

04:34.998 --> 04:36.731
Your needs, his needs.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.873
Love is part of the process.

04:39.588 --> 04:41.080
The negotiation process.

04:41.389 --> 04:43.032
Look, it doesn't make it any less real.

04:43.079 --> 04:44.397
I do love Terence.

04:44.781 --> 04:47.169
I just have a realistic
view of my marriage, is all.

04:48.393 --> 04:50.693
- That it serves a purpose.
- Yeah.

04:51.011 --> 04:53.386
For now. And maybe one day it won't.

04:57.402 --> 04:59.402
You sure you got bullets
left in the chamber, old man?

05:00.898 --> 05:02.032
Oh, I'm sure.

05:02.207 --> 05:04.574
Strong swimmers, actually. So says the doc.

05:04.807 --> 05:07.255
And DeAnn's good to go, so.

05:07.856 --> 05:09.057
A kid.

05:09.448 --> 05:12.248
So what's this about? Mid-life crisis?

05:15.714 --> 05:16.976
It's about legacy.

05:17.871 --> 05:20.298
Somebody to carry IHM
forward after I'm gone.

05:20.659 --> 05:23.409
Someone whose mind can go beyond mine.

05:24.196 --> 05:26.329
So, mid-life crisis.

05:29.034 --> 05:30.467
IHM's your foundation, Kyle.

05:30.535 --> 05:32.071
I'd be careful of minimizing it.

05:32.638 --> 05:34.044
It wasn't my intention.

05:34.815 --> 05:35.855
Are you sure?

05:36.041 --> 05:37.007
It's been a rough couple of weeks.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.141
I haven't heard from you.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.776
Doing any work on yourself?

05:40.445 --> 05:43.933
Well, maybe it's been rough
for you, but I feel great.

05:44.883 --> 05:46.149
Hey, did you miss us?

05:46.218 --> 05:48.531
- Oh, terribly.
- What took you so long?

07:00.917 --> 07:02.350
Well, this is fun.

07:02.419 --> 07:04.385
I almost wish I was turning 40.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.150
No, you don't.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.826
Listen, I just wanted to check in with you.

07:09.895 --> 07:13.065
Those photos of me and Hope,
strictly a one-time thing.

07:13.932 --> 07:16.666
She reached out to me wanting
to make amends, I guess.

07:16.735 --> 07:19.302
So I figured for the sake of closure.

07:20.806 --> 07:22.733
Yeah, I figured that's what it was.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.176
I bet this is where the really interesting

07:26.245 --> 07:27.711
conversation's happening.

07:28.313 --> 07:29.846
Actually, we were just
talking about what it's

07:29.915 --> 07:31.748
going to take to get your significant other

07:31.817 --> 07:33.083
to the intro workshop.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.377
What do we have to do, Xavier?

07:36.033 --> 07:38.179
Come on, putting on the
full-court press here, man.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.926
I'm the only one that's not IHM here.

07:44.363 --> 07:47.998
Don't worry. We don't
bite. Don't be scared.

07:59.945 --> 08:02.345
- Kyle! Kyle!
- Over here! Over here!

08:02.414 --> 08:04.447
- Kyle.
- Can we get Xavier and Megan?

08:06.821 --> 08:08.185
Xavier, Megan!

08:08.253 --> 08:09.896
- What's up, co-star?
- Hey.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.097
Get the hell out of here.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.499
Terence had his sperm checked.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.534
What? Meanwhile DeAnn's in the bathroom

08:24.603 --> 08:26.770
telling me that their
marriage is temporary.

08:27.072 --> 08:28.839
These are the last people on Earth

08:28.907 --> 08:30.240
that should be having kids.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.095
You know they have an open relationship?

08:33.006 --> 08:33.943
What?

08:34.011 --> 08:35.712
Yeah, yeah, sex with other people

08:35.780 --> 08:37.113
in various configurations.

08:37.182 --> 08:38.390
God.

08:38.897 --> 08:41.297
Oh, please tell me that's
not an IHM principle.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.425
- Kyle!
- Ow!

08:46.658 --> 08:48.792
All right, all right, all
right, it's just them, okay?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.594
- Just them.
- Oh, God.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.381
I do not want us to end up like that.

08:52.898 --> 08:55.021
Oh, never in a million years.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.101
I am not sharing you with anybody.

09:25.497 --> 09:27.258
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

09:28.433 --> 09:29.634
You're welcome.

09:31.303 --> 09:32.768
There's one more thing.

09:44.249 --> 09:46.500
Oh, Terence, it's beautiful.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.838
And then the entire crew hears him say

10:08.907 --> 10:10.307
"Yeah, stroke the shaft.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.531
Cradle the balls. Yeah."

10:13.217 --> 10:15.310
Uh, don't freak out. I'm still here.

10:16.064 --> 10:18.464
Uh, I found Agent Jane's
back story on the dark web

10:18.532 --> 10:20.077
in case you want to do some research.

10:21.168 --> 10:22.560
Wow. Thank you.

10:23.003 --> 10:25.310
You know what? Remind me
to give you a raise, Zach.

10:26.773 --> 10:29.280
- I'm gonna go change.
- I'll walk you out.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.604
This has to stop.

10:38.886 --> 10:40.385
The looks, the innuendos.

10:40.454 --> 10:42.854
Kyle's not an idiot. He notices.

10:42.923 --> 10:44.556
I'm not gonna stop until you talk to me.

10:44.625 --> 10:45.724
Well then I'll get you fired.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.525
And nothing will change for you.

10:47.594 --> 10:50.095
Or for anyone. And Terence will win.

10:50.332 --> 10:52.939
Win what? There's nothing to win.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.238
Megan, I know what they did to you.

10:55.502 --> 10:57.400
I know how they took you to the Facility.

10:57.804 --> 10:59.510
You need to go home, Zach.

11:00.774 --> 11:01.916
They took my mother, too.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.048
Six years ago.

11:05.512 --> 11:06.956
I helped them do it.

11:07.481 --> 11:09.614
Four months later, they let her come home.

11:09.683 --> 11:11.189
Then she killed herself.

11:12.697 --> 11:15.081
And I got rewarded for my loyalty.

11:17.124 --> 11:19.223
They did something to her up there.

11:20.267 --> 11:21.623
I can't help you.

11:21.995 --> 11:25.363
I know others, and we
need someone with a voice.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.399
Someone the public will listen to.

11:27.467 --> 11:31.229
If we're gonna stop him, we need you.

11:34.312 --> 11:36.207
Terence is a great man.

11:48.018 --> 11:49.315
Just stay calm.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.674
You think you can steal from me?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.696
I'm gonna crack your goddamn skull.

11:53.290 --> 11:54.790
Lady, there's a phone behind the register.

11:54.859 --> 11:56.043
Call the police.

11:56.427 --> 11:58.360
Meanwhile, I think I'm
gonna have to defend myself.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.916
I'm feeling a little threatened.

12:01.051 --> 12:02.584
Now you're being threatened.

12:02.652 --> 12:04.619
- And cut!
- Cut it.

12:04.688 --> 12:06.254
- Okay!
- Cutting.

12:09.108 --> 12:10.788
Xavier's a little flat, no?

12:22.321 --> 12:24.040
All right, guys, I've got some thoughts.

12:26.092 --> 12:27.258
Hey, hello.

12:29.401 --> 12:30.677
What? Someone die?

12:38.312 --> 12:40.312
_

12:40.349 --> 12:42.783
They asked for that photo
of me and Xavier last night.

12:42.808 --> 12:44.574
It's almost like they already had the idea.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.137
You think somebody got
ahold of the contract?

12:46.245 --> 12:47.745
No, they would have published it.

12:47.814 --> 12:49.371
Somebody obviously leaked something.

12:49.371 --> 12:50.804
- Does Hope know about this?
- I didn't tell her,

12:50.873 --> 12:52.139
but she wouldn't...

12:52.207 --> 12:53.740
What? Leak something to the press?

12:53.809 --> 12:55.776
- She doesn't know, Kyle.
- Okay, look, it's possible

12:55.844 --> 12:57.644
- somebody just made it up.
- Oh, come on.

12:57.713 --> 12:58.799
Look, there's blood in the water,

12:58.824 --> 13:00.314
and people are assholes, Kyle.

13:00.382 --> 13:01.682
And fake relationships aren't exactly

13:01.750 --> 13:03.150
a new idea in this town.

13:03.218 --> 13:04.318
Okay, but the truth is,

13:04.386 --> 13:05.752
this isn't a fake relationship,

13:05.821 --> 13:07.287
and I'm not in love with Xavier.

13:07.356 --> 13:08.555
So if there's no proof

13:08.624 --> 13:10.591
then won't the story just wither and die?

13:10.659 --> 13:12.225
Everything withers and dies.

13:12.294 --> 13:13.863
We just need to turn this around.

13:16.031 --> 13:18.966
I have to focus. I... I can't
get sucked into this right now.

13:23.017 --> 13:24.494
How about an N?

13:27.209 --> 13:28.771
I know what the answer is.

13:29.111 --> 13:32.047
It's "nervous system."
That was an easy one.

13:32.548 --> 13:34.587
I agree. Challenge me.

13:35.050 --> 13:37.250
It was Eli's idea to put biology

13:37.319 --> 13:39.119
at the center of his home-schooling.

13:39.188 --> 13:41.747
He needed a way to understand
what happened to his dad.

13:42.358 --> 13:45.539
How the body works, and how it can fail.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.028
That's the exact principle

13:48.097 --> 13:49.596
behind the First Life Initiative.

13:49.665 --> 13:52.337
So imagine Eli with five other children

13:52.568 --> 13:55.235
building a curriculum
from their own stories.

13:55.304 --> 13:57.673
Learning support and compassion as they go.

13:57.973 --> 13:59.325
That would be amazing.

14:01.815 --> 14:02.891
Sorry, Eli.

14:03.112 --> 14:05.866
Um, this will go away. See
if you can't save me here.

14:07.549 --> 14:09.016
Hi... slow down.

14:09.084 --> 14:10.884
What exactly does the article say?

14:10.953 --> 14:12.552
There's a million
articles out there by now.

14:12.621 --> 14:14.454
Okay, just... just try and stay focused

14:14.523 --> 14:16.390
on what's in front of you.
Okay? I'll talk to DeAnn.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.792
We'll meet with Creative Partners.
We'll come up with a plan.

14:18.861 --> 14:20.527
Are you going to come up with a plan?

14:20.596 --> 14:22.288
<i>Okay, because the contract
was your plan, too.</i>

14:22.406 --> 14:24.270
- Kyle.
- Look, it is out there, Terence,

14:24.270 --> 14:25.414
all right? Now the whole world thinks

14:25.414 --> 14:26.580
that I have some sort of problem.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.442
Like I can't get anybody to love me.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.640
Fix it.

14:44.873 --> 14:46.000
You know why, Adam?

14:46.068 --> 14:47.534
Because you are like number five

14:47.603 --> 14:49.169
on my list of problems right now.

14:49.238 --> 14:51.138
So why don't you just, like, I don't know,

14:51.207 --> 14:53.156
- Go play golf or something.
- DeAnn.

14:54.682 --> 14:56.110
You don't want your present?

14:56.178 --> 14:57.720
Oh, Wes, I'm sorry.

14:57.745 --> 14:58.946
I've been managing the apocalypse.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.080
You didn't have to do that.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.998
I did. Happy Birthday.

15:03.052 --> 15:04.908
Oh, wow, Wes. Seriously?

15:09.210 --> 15:10.645
This was Mason's.

15:11.027 --> 15:12.408
It's her birthstone.

15:15.965 --> 15:17.698
I was hoping that you'd want it,

15:17.767 --> 15:20.729
but if it's too, I don't know, heavy or...

15:21.370 --> 15:22.999
No, Wes, it's perfect.

15:24.526 --> 15:26.173
Especially on a day like today.

15:26.242 --> 15:28.230
It's good to be reminded of real things.

15:28.402 --> 15:30.364
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:30.939 --> 15:33.380
So the apocalypse isn't real?

15:33.449 --> 15:36.374
Well, that depends on whose
career you're talking about.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.373
Who is that?

15:38.954 --> 15:40.190
Reinforcements.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.741
Where is she?

15:42.357 --> 15:43.557
Hey, what's up?

15:43.855 --> 15:44.839
Hey.

15:45.261 --> 15:46.363
Can we talk?

15:47.422 --> 15:49.057
No, need, brother. We're good.

15:49.135 --> 15:51.183
All right, but look, I just gotta say...

15:52.268 --> 15:54.017
I feel close to everybody here.

15:54.403 --> 15:56.637
And that's cause you and Megan
made it feel like a family

15:56.706 --> 15:57.910
from the jump.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.339
I'm not cool with people saying

15:59.408 --> 16:00.578
it's something else.

16:01.716 --> 16:04.322
Me neither. You know what we're gonna do?

16:04.869 --> 16:05.868
Tell me.

16:05.937 --> 16:07.319
We're gonna crush this movie,

16:07.319 --> 16:09.608
and everybody else can shove
the rumors up their ass.

16:10.252 --> 16:13.186
Well, you know I like rage.
Let's harness that shit.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.325
- Appreciate it, man.
- You got it.

16:25.167 --> 16:27.695
We were scheduling your
screen test for Agent Jane

16:27.726 --> 16:29.144
when the story broke.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.504
Now they're quiet. They're hedging.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.872
So they're buying into the rumors.

16:32.941 --> 16:34.784
This is so high school.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.212
Is it?

16:37.045 --> 16:38.717
Let's review your last year.

16:39.014 --> 16:40.847
You had a nude photo scandal,

16:41.152 --> 16:42.348
fired from a movie,

16:42.417 --> 16:43.783
you're friends with porn stars,

16:44.153 --> 16:45.319
and you did pass out

16:45.387 --> 16:46.920
at that event where you were being honored.

16:46.988 --> 16:48.288
Is that what you were like in high school?

16:48.356 --> 16:49.823
No, and that's not exactly how it all...

16:49.891 --> 16:51.257
'Cause I wouldn't have hung out with you.

16:51.326 --> 16:52.802
Wow, okay.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.197
You think popularity is trite?

16:57.402 --> 16:59.664
But popularity is our business.

17:00.038 --> 17:02.405
The girl with the arranged
marriage and the affair?

17:02.474 --> 17:03.707
She doesn't get to be prom queen.

17:03.775 --> 17:05.185
Bullshit rumors are trite.

17:05.538 --> 17:07.867
And if I was a man no one would care.

17:09.281 --> 17:11.114
You're my agent, why
don't you make that point?

17:11.183 --> 17:12.848
Because I run the biggest agency in town,

17:12.917 --> 17:14.674
and I didn't get there by being naive.

17:15.665 --> 17:18.284
Kyle will absorb this, yes.

17:18.569 --> 17:19.930
Because he's a man.

17:20.391 --> 17:22.025
But also because he's got a body of work

17:22.094 --> 17:24.160
that dwarfs yours, and, "Kill Plan" aside,

17:24.229 --> 17:25.877
he's a proven commodity. You're not.

17:25.932 --> 17:27.698
So you have to get out
from under this narrative.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.500
Otherwise, forget Agent Jane.

17:29.739 --> 17:31.140
You're going to be a punch line.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.140
Okay. What do I need to do?

17:43.877 --> 17:45.334
This is actually pretty nice.

17:45.813 --> 17:48.193
- All things considered.
- Yeah, it's incredible.

17:48.582 --> 17:50.843
Oh, come on. We've been on set for a month.

17:51.151 --> 17:52.728
We're getting some sun.

17:52.986 --> 17:54.685
We got the sound of the ocean.

17:55.089 --> 17:57.889
And my career is teetering
on the brink of disaster.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.329
Don't be so grumpy.

17:59.354 --> 18:01.187
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Did you have a flop, too?

18:01.495 --> 18:04.495
See? Another reason to take
the air out of the rumors.

18:04.956 --> 18:06.268
You'll be fine, babe.

18:09.370 --> 18:11.135
Wanna chase me down the beach?

18:11.538 --> 18:13.338
Yeah, no. I'm not gonna
chase you down the beach.

18:13.407 --> 18:16.382
Oh-ho-ho, you're afraid
you won't look cool, K-man?

18:17.444 --> 18:19.478
- Did you just call me K-man?
- Yeah, yeah, I said it.

18:19.546 --> 18:21.446
K-man. What ya gonna do about it?

18:21.515 --> 18:23.382
Ah, I don't know. You
want to go for a swim?

18:23.450 --> 18:24.483
Huh, we're going.

18:24.551 --> 18:26.024
We're going. In the water.

18:26.049 --> 18:27.815
- Here we go.
- Put me down.

18:27.884 --> 18:29.016
All right, all right, all right, all right.

18:36.373 --> 18:37.540
That was good.

18:42.858 --> 18:44.042
Hope they got it.

18:45.861 --> 18:47.099
Ah, here they come.

18:48.097 --> 18:49.248
Hey.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.833
You're not expecting me to
pull that Tarzan bit, are you?

18:52.901 --> 18:54.768
Don't wanna hurt myself...

18:55.127 --> 18:56.775
Thank you guys for doing this.

18:57.539 --> 19:00.483
The paparazzi should be here
for another 30 minutes or so.

19:01.276 --> 19:02.743
Let's make the most of it then.

19:02.811 --> 19:05.699
Two happy couples. All good.

19:05.814 --> 19:07.781
Xavier would like to reframe this narrative

19:07.850 --> 19:09.307
as much as anyone.

19:10.386 --> 19:11.885
That's what I'm talking about.

19:11.954 --> 19:13.420
Let me see your spiral. Come on!

19:16.959 --> 19:19.215
- Want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.166
Oh, the man's got hands!

19:23.332 --> 19:24.765
You know, it's so funny.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.067
Xavier's always talking about you.

19:27.136 --> 19:29.503
So I feel like I know you, but
we've never actually hung out.

19:29.571 --> 19:31.338
Just the two of us.

19:31.407 --> 19:34.474
That's actually not
funny, but what is funny

19:34.543 --> 19:37.207
is how full of shit you are right now.

19:38.402 --> 19:40.694
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, first of all,

19:41.116 --> 19:42.883
you don't like me, and you never have.

19:42.951 --> 19:44.384
- No, that's so not true...
- And second of all,

19:44.453 --> 19:47.480
let's just admit what we both already know.

19:47.656 --> 19:49.923
Rumors are almost always true.

19:49.992 --> 19:51.425
Nasim, no, not these.

19:51.493 --> 19:54.093
There's nothing going
on between me and Xavier.

19:54.363 --> 19:58.131
Really, so if the story was
about me and Kyle hooking up

19:58.200 --> 20:00.434
on a movie we were doing
together, would you believe me

20:00.502 --> 20:02.269
when I absolutely swore it was all a lie?

20:02.337 --> 20:04.704
I would, and I want you to believe me.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.121
Take your hand off me
before I swat it away.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.460
<i>That's fantastic.
Kyle will be thrilled.</i>

20:22.956 --> 20:25.223
And please let Iris know,
if she's up to it on Friday,

20:25.291 --> 20:26.802
we'd love to have her over for dinner.

20:27.452 --> 20:28.654
Okay, thanks.

20:30.911 --> 20:32.078
Not pregnant.

20:35.124 --> 20:36.953
Well, I... I do have some good news.

20:37.468 --> 20:39.368
Sunday News Night wants
to do a feature on Kyle

20:39.436 --> 20:41.029
and his relationship with IHM.

20:41.205 --> 20:43.672
Iris Holloway. They're coming next weekend.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.440
I'm gonna be in Toronto for the festival.

20:45.509 --> 20:47.167
That's fine. I'll take care of it.

20:48.011 --> 20:49.366
It's a big audience.

20:49.613 --> 20:51.980
He can reclaim the
narrative, talk about IHM.

20:52.049 --> 20:53.248
It will be good for him.

20:53.317 --> 20:55.150
He's been a bit untethered lately.

20:55.219 --> 20:56.325
Haven't we all.

20:57.101 --> 20:59.121
Hey. We'll keep trying.

21:02.776 --> 21:04.378
That's not the necklace I gave you.

21:05.496 --> 21:08.726
Well, the one you gave me is
hardly appropriate for Pilates.

21:10.901 --> 21:12.130
Where'd it come from?

21:13.404 --> 21:14.874
It was Mason's.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.860
My friend who passed away.

21:20.073 --> 21:21.301
She left it to you?

21:22.279 --> 21:23.977
Her son gave it to me.

21:24.248 --> 21:26.033
- Wes, the new P.A.
- Oh.

21:26.483 --> 21:29.811
I... I didn't realize
that was your friend's son.

21:30.821 --> 21:32.754
Yeah. Yeah, he's going through a rough time

21:32.823 --> 21:34.489
right now so I gave him a job, and this was

21:34.558 --> 21:35.899
his way of saying thank you.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.327
I'll see you later.

21:58.562 --> 22:01.199
Guys. Can we huddle up over here?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.657
Hey, could you explain to Nasim

22:07.726 --> 22:10.043
that nothing is happening between us?

22:10.044 --> 22:12.595
We've had the conversation multiple times.

22:13.181 --> 22:14.797
She refuses to trust me.

22:15.116 --> 22:17.357
'Cause you've made it so easy.

22:18.498 --> 22:19.564
All right, could you just please

22:19.633 --> 22:21.065
take it easy on the champagne?

22:21.134 --> 22:22.433
All right, look, come on, guys.

22:22.502 --> 22:24.268
We all know what it's like being on a set.

22:24.337 --> 22:25.870
A bunch of beautiful people
spending way too much time

22:25.939 --> 22:27.205
together and things get personal.

22:27.273 --> 22:28.792
Kyle, are you trying to help right now?

22:28.792 --> 22:30.508
But the boundaries are still there.

22:30.577 --> 22:31.809
That's what I'm saying.

22:31.878 --> 22:33.055
- That's my point.
- Thank you.

22:33.951 --> 22:35.213
And at the end of the day, we come home

22:35.238 --> 22:36.362
to the person we love.

22:37.250 --> 22:40.532
Do we? Because last time he came home,

22:40.532 --> 22:42.386
he called out her name.

22:43.883 --> 22:44.949
What?

22:44.974 --> 22:47.317
Yeah, he crawled into my bed,

22:47.352 --> 22:49.538
put his hands all over me, and then he says

22:49.607 --> 22:52.241
"Oh, Clyde... you feel so amazing."

22:52.489 --> 22:53.743
It was a long day.

22:54.061 --> 22:55.873
We shot until 2:00 in the morning.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.946
I love you, baby.

22:58.015 --> 23:00.115
Yeah, and Nasim, Clyde
is my character's name.

23:00.183 --> 23:02.672
- It's not me.
- Stop it. Just stop it.

23:04.888 --> 23:06.488
Oh, my God. I can't do this anymore.

23:06.556 --> 23:09.290
- Please don't cry.
- It's in your eyes, Xavier.

23:09.290 --> 23:10.590
The way you look at her.

23:10.658 --> 23:12.191
It's the way you used to look at me.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.119
You're falling in love with her and I...

23:16.188 --> 23:17.521
- Baby, I'm...
- I can't stand here

23:17.590 --> 23:19.456
and pretend like it's not happening.

23:23.495 --> 23:25.095
Hey, she's wrong.

23:25.164 --> 23:27.081
I'm not falling in love with you.

23:30.336 --> 23:32.106
Hey, back up. Back up, back up.

23:33.005 --> 23:34.241
Oh, my God.

23:35.574 --> 23:37.081
Just keep smiling, baby.

23:37.676 --> 23:39.443
- Hey, hey. Baby.
- Leave me alone.

23:46.084 --> 23:47.906
It is an E-News exclusive

23:47.931 --> 23:49.151
as we bring you photographs

23:49.176 --> 23:50.275
of what appears to be

23:50.300 --> 23:51.479
a highly emotional fight

23:51.479 --> 23:52.478
between Xavier Hughes

23:52.546 --> 23:53.902
and Nasim Anand.

23:53.927 --> 23:55.339
Yeah, this all went down just hours ago

23:55.341 --> 23:57.308
on a private beach in Malibu.

23:57.376 --> 23:59.183
All in full view of Kyle West

23:59.183 --> 24:00.799
and fiancé Megan Morrison.

24:00.799 --> 24:02.065
There is a lot to unpack here.

24:02.134 --> 24:03.733
Yeah, there absolutely is, Will.

24:03.802 --> 24:05.268
Rumors of an arranged relationship,

24:05.337 --> 24:07.737
an on-set affair between Megan and Xavier

24:07.806 --> 24:10.106
which the Kygan camp has vehemently denied.

24:10.175 --> 24:11.841
<i>But this blowup at the beach</i>

24:11.910 --> 24:14.301
<i>seems to confirm at
least half of it.</i>

24:14.533 --> 24:17.559
<i>So, are we talking
about an actual love triangle?</i>

24:17.596 --> 24:19.763
<i>Or, if Kygan is an arrangement,</i>

24:19.832 --> 24:21.698
<i>is it a triangle at all?</i>

24:21.767 --> 24:23.912
<i>Could it actually be that
Kyle West is snake-bitten</i>

24:23.937 --> 24:25.045
<i>when it comes to love?</i>

24:25.045 --> 24:27.129
<i>Or is there something else going on?</i>

24:27.997 --> 24:30.415
Look, you just got to let
this stuff roll off your back.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.119
Off my back and onto
my giant list of credits.

24:33.452 --> 24:34.587
Oh, wait.

24:34.718 --> 24:36.674
Stop worrying about your resume

24:36.699 --> 24:39.566
or your next movie or
whatever Karen's saying, okay?

24:39.805 --> 24:41.301
We got this movie.

24:41.370 --> 24:43.409
"Technicolor Highway."
We need to focus on that.

24:44.073 --> 24:45.239
That and the fact that your co-star

24:45.307 --> 24:46.851
clearly has feelings for you.

24:47.843 --> 24:49.798
Oh, come on... you don't believe that.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.314
Nasim put on a show, Kyle. She hijacked us.

24:54.383 --> 24:56.817
And now she's going to milk
the jilted girlfriend thing

24:56.886 --> 24:59.119
- in the press.
- Yeah, probably.

24:59.188 --> 25:00.873
But she's right about
the way he looks at you.

25:02.707 --> 25:03.925
I've seen it.

25:13.469 --> 25:16.937
Why? You think anyone would
care if that asshole died?

25:17.006 --> 25:19.238
- I'd be doing the world a favor.
- That's not the point.

25:19.263 --> 25:21.742
I just want to do something,
just once, that feels right.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.077
But it wouldn't be right for you.

25:23.145 --> 25:25.136
Trust me, Clyde. You're not a killer.

25:25.848 --> 25:26.847
Cut!

25:34.390 --> 25:36.192
What are we on, take 16?

25:36.926 --> 25:39.693
I think he's just feeling
the pressure to make it perfect.

25:39.762 --> 25:42.108
Or he's punishing me for what Nasim said.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.234
You know that was just
about the work, right?

25:50.039 --> 25:51.426
Hey, guys.

25:51.741 --> 25:54.177
Uh, little less intensity at the top.

25:54.510 --> 25:56.211
And Megan, keep doing what you're doing.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.851
One more time, guys.

26:00.416 --> 26:03.038
- Going again! Back to one.
- Back to one.

26:03.619 --> 26:05.497
<i>Look, your life is never normal.</i>

26:05.855 --> 26:07.955
But these stories in the media right now.

26:08.023 --> 26:10.057
The pressure on this movie, it's extreme.

26:10.126 --> 26:12.558
For anyone, not to mention
someone with your history.

26:12.928 --> 26:15.082
I couldn't agree more,
and I'm dealing with it.

26:16.098 --> 26:17.820
I just don't think you're
being honest with yourself.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.367
Look, I don't want to
spend an entire weekend

26:20.436 --> 26:22.342
pushing IHM on national TV.

26:23.139 --> 26:24.420
Doesn't mean I'm in denial.

26:24.707 --> 26:25.892
Hey.

26:27.076 --> 26:29.510
Fair enough. So you'll do it as a favor.

26:35.718 --> 26:36.922
What was that about?

26:37.787 --> 26:39.605
He booked us on Iris Holloway.

26:40.274 --> 26:41.878
He wants you to do more press?

26:42.161 --> 26:44.394
It's more of an infomercial for IHM,

26:44.480 --> 26:46.010
and he always wants you to do it.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.215
So I guess we'll do it.

26:53.511 --> 26:54.490
Yeah.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.749
I'll be right back.

27:10.361 --> 27:11.494
Zach.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.318
I can't watch Terence control Kyle anymore.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.823
I'm ready to meet your friends.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.629
Yeah, I'll see if
they're ready to meet you.

27:33.415 --> 27:34.889
Appreciate that, Wes.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.153
Wes. Wes, right?

27:37.222 --> 27:38.688
- Yeah.
- I'm Terence Anderson.

27:38.756 --> 27:40.695
DeAnn's husband. She
speaks very highly of you.

27:41.659 --> 27:43.593
It's good to meet you.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.161
DeAnn's amazing.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.129
- I know.
- That's why I married her.

27:47.198 --> 27:48.731
You got deliveries to
make? I'll walk with you.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.900
Yeah.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.969
Sorry about your mom. How are you doing?

27:53.037 --> 27:54.352
I'm doing okay.

27:54.572 --> 27:55.820
I'm hanging in.

27:56.306 --> 27:57.591
Enjoying the job?

27:57.774 --> 27:59.708
Yeah, I've always loved movies.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.143
It's great to see them
bring the characters to life.

28:02.212 --> 28:03.856
Ah, so you want to be an actor.

28:04.815 --> 28:07.215
I've got a good feel for
people. It's what I do.

28:08.432 --> 28:09.487
Wes!

28:11.428 --> 28:12.587
Set's that way.

28:12.898 --> 28:15.237
Right. Um, it was nice to meet you.

28:15.262 --> 28:16.332
You too.

28:19.607 --> 28:20.805
What are you doing?

28:21.235 --> 28:23.686
Just saying hello. Seems like a bright kid.

28:24.490 --> 28:26.958
Yeah, he's been through a
rough time so do me a favor.

28:26.983 --> 28:28.100
Leave him alone.

28:28.897 --> 28:30.530
What am I, the big bad wolf?

28:30.599 --> 28:31.980
I'm just talking to him.
What's the matter with you?

28:31.980 --> 28:33.279
What were you talking to him about anyway?

28:33.349 --> 28:34.810
- Was it IHM?
- No.

28:35.251 --> 28:36.917
But don't you think it'd be good for him?

28:37.244 --> 28:38.343
It's not your call to make, Terence.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.711
Mason was my friend.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.409
I should be the one to
look out for her son.

28:43.849 --> 28:46.811
Look out for him, wear
the necklace he gave you.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.902
What exactly are you trying to tell me?

28:49.656 --> 28:52.197
- Nothing.
- Don't be disgusting.

28:53.705 --> 28:56.137
Did it start as payback?
For the tie on the door.

28:58.018 --> 28:59.343
Don't do this.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.051
You have feelings, DeAnn.

29:02.835 --> 29:05.736
I may not give you everything
you want, but I know you.

29:05.806 --> 29:07.906
I sense them, and you have been in and out

29:07.975 --> 29:09.443
of our relationship for months.

29:10.044 --> 29:11.512
We're trying to have a child.

29:12.012 --> 29:13.844
Now is not the time to lie to each other.

29:14.248 --> 29:16.949
I care for Wes like a son.

29:17.017 --> 29:18.884
- That is all.
- DeAnn.

29:21.488 --> 29:23.818
Because I had feelings for his mother.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.877
Your college friend?

29:27.665 --> 29:28.776
Yes.

29:29.964 --> 29:31.768
The woman I was in love with.

29:37.538 --> 29:39.440
When? How long?

29:40.841 --> 29:42.791
It doesn't matter. She's gone.

29:43.544 --> 29:45.053
Of course it matters.

30:07.028 --> 30:08.816
I thought I was the only one here.

30:12.165 --> 30:13.420
You're not alone.

30:13.833 --> 30:16.100
I just set up meetings

30:16.169 --> 30:18.368
with another four families.

30:18.430 --> 30:20.656
We are really building a foundation.

30:23.610 --> 30:24.701
That's funny.

30:25.812 --> 30:27.597
My foundation feels shaky.

30:29.182 --> 30:30.237
Are you okay?

30:34.020 --> 30:35.105
Terence.

30:36.115 --> 30:37.495
I'd rather not talk about it.

30:39.119 --> 30:40.193
Okay.

30:41.588 --> 30:44.459
You've always been available to me.

30:45.292 --> 30:47.123
I just want to make sure you know

30:47.879 --> 30:49.167
I'm here for you, too.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.325
Thank you.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.654
I just feel there's certain things

30:57.722 --> 30:59.038
you and I shouldn't share.

31:09.848 --> 31:10.961
You know...

31:12.082 --> 31:15.295
whenever my foundation feels shaky...

31:17.754 --> 31:19.268
I go to church.

31:20.924 --> 31:22.146
Why church?

31:23.259 --> 31:24.611
It inspires me.

31:26.333 --> 31:27.687
You don't get that here?

31:28.437 --> 31:29.476
Sure.

31:29.938 --> 31:32.839
But sometimes you don't want
to have to think about it

31:32.908 --> 31:36.471
or work for it. You just want to feel it.

31:37.165 --> 31:38.293
You know?

31:39.409 --> 31:42.177
So, church.

32:11.408 --> 32:12.574
You ready?

32:12.642 --> 32:14.609
This better be what you say it is.

32:15.378 --> 32:17.206
They said the same thing about you.

32:33.630 --> 32:36.131
Megan, this is Hudson and Gail.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.357
You were at my engagement party.

32:38.835 --> 32:40.101
It's good to see you again.

32:40.279 --> 32:41.890
Why isn't she blindfolded?

32:42.172 --> 32:44.038
- She wouldn't wear it.
- Then I'm not doing this.

32:44.107 --> 32:46.141
Wait, hold on. We all want the same thing.

32:46.209 --> 32:48.076
We're gonna have to at
least listen to each other.

32:51.049 --> 32:52.613
They kidnapped me.

32:52.682 --> 32:56.255
They threw me in a van, and
they took me to the Facility.

32:57.693 --> 32:59.635
I was a prisoner for three weeks.

33:00.257 --> 33:01.489
The whole time they were telling me

33:01.558 --> 33:03.048
they were going to make me better.

33:03.950 --> 33:07.362
- They kept me for four months.
- Hudson, she's an actress.

33:07.430 --> 33:09.903
And I'm tired of operating from fear, Gail.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.034
If you've been through what I've through,

33:13.103 --> 33:14.868
why are you still IHM?

33:15.338 --> 33:16.566
Why are you?

33:18.334 --> 33:20.750
Because I love Kyle.

33:21.444 --> 33:23.965
- It's complicated.
- So they say.

33:24.548 --> 33:27.083
Well, I love IHM.

33:28.018 --> 33:29.712
It's Terence I want to stop.

33:30.086 --> 33:32.672
One way or another he's put
us all through the same thing.

33:33.256 --> 33:34.674
We just can't prove it.

33:35.959 --> 33:38.059
So you couldn't find the Facility either.

33:38.395 --> 33:40.962
He knows how to make things
look like they never happened.

33:42.805 --> 33:44.905
My ex-wife helped them take me

33:44.973 --> 33:46.239
after I got fired from my job.

33:46.308 --> 33:47.941
I was unemployed. It was summer.

33:48.010 --> 33:49.242
Nobody missed me.

33:49.311 --> 33:51.178
Plus, there's whatever he has on you.

33:54.381 --> 33:56.257
You didn't have to confess your sins?

33:58.352 --> 34:00.186
What's your story anyway, Gail?

34:00.760 --> 34:03.426
My story doesn't matter. None of ours do.

34:03.604 --> 34:06.209
They're flies on Terence's windshield.

34:06.801 --> 34:08.167
We have to prove something

34:08.235 --> 34:10.203
that can actually take him down.

34:10.271 --> 34:11.606
Not just wound him.

34:12.273 --> 34:15.308
The minute we go to the police,
he comes at us with everything.

34:15.799 --> 34:17.791
Then what exactly am I doing here?

34:19.502 --> 34:20.536
Tell her.

34:25.574 --> 34:27.732
I was a stylist in my other life.

34:28.043 --> 34:31.746
About ten years ago, a girl
named Julie Woolth came to me.

34:31.815 --> 34:34.683
She was an actor. She just joined IHM.

34:34.951 --> 34:37.976
They'd found her an agent,
got her some print work.

34:38.391 --> 34:40.896
Terence told her they were
going to make her an icon.

34:41.594 --> 34:43.583
She said "icon?"

34:44.164 --> 34:45.693
She wouldn't stop saying it.

34:45.998 --> 34:47.099
She came over almost every day

34:47.167 --> 34:48.934
wanting to talk about her image.

34:49.002 --> 34:51.570
I figured, typical narcissist.

34:52.646 --> 34:54.071
She just vanished.

34:54.848 --> 34:57.292
Phone was turned off. Facebook page gone.

34:59.119 --> 35:00.814
She... is she dead?

35:03.056 --> 35:04.220
I thought so.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.682
And then I saw her in Sherman Oaks

35:06.921 --> 35:08.184
a couple years ago.

35:08.922 --> 35:10.922
She'd changed her hair, put on some weight,

35:10.991 --> 35:12.257
but I knew it was her.

35:12.326 --> 35:13.625
So I... I called out to her.

35:13.694 --> 35:16.107
The look of terror on her face

35:17.337 --> 35:18.463
I will never forget.

35:18.876 --> 35:20.411
What is she scared of?

35:21.236 --> 35:22.762
Being discovered.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.289
She said she was back for
a funeral, and she begged me

35:26.358 --> 35:28.413
not to tell anyone that I'd seen her.

35:28.413 --> 35:30.218
She said she wasn't allowed to be in LA.

35:30.673 --> 35:32.545
That she was risking her life.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.074
Terence threatened her.

35:34.142 --> 35:36.877
Really? Did she say that?

35:36.945 --> 35:38.678
Did she say that Terence
threatened her life?

35:38.747 --> 35:40.113
It's the logical conclusion.

35:40.182 --> 35:42.349
Whatever Julie did or whatever she knew,

35:42.417 --> 35:44.295
he needed her far away.

35:45.140 --> 35:46.920
And if we can find out why,

35:46.989 --> 35:49.700
that would do some real damage.

35:51.326 --> 35:53.527
Why haven't you come
forward with this before?

35:53.595 --> 35:55.596
'Cause Julie Woolth doesn't exist anymore.

35:55.931 --> 35:57.297
And we don't have the kind of access

35:57.366 --> 35:59.199
we need to track her down through IHM.

35:59.268 --> 36:00.780
We're not important.

36:01.214 --> 36:02.649
But you're Kyle's fiancé.

36:03.705 --> 36:05.875
You're about as important as they get.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.931
To long relationships.

36:15.035 --> 36:16.527
Old friends. Hear, hear.

36:19.406 --> 36:21.424
So, tell me something I don't know.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.143
Excited for the wedding?

36:25.338 --> 36:26.372
Sure.

36:27.675 --> 36:29.324
Megan? Is she excited too?

36:29.819 --> 36:31.985
You didn't ask her? She's your client, too.

36:32.053 --> 36:34.420
She and I are in a...
we're in a different place

36:34.489 --> 36:35.910
than you and me.

36:39.728 --> 36:41.961
Well, um, Megan's very excited.

36:42.030 --> 36:45.012
But all the stuff in the
press has her a little nervous.

36:45.552 --> 36:46.699
Well, she should be.

36:46.768 --> 36:49.068
You, on the other hand, are coming off

36:49.137 --> 36:51.270
one of the greatest winning
streaks in Hollywood.

36:51.295 --> 36:52.833
- Do you know that?
- I do.

36:53.708 --> 36:55.911
And I'd like to start
another one right now.

36:58.012 --> 37:00.146
"Technicolor Highway" can be a part of it.

37:00.493 --> 37:02.607
But I'd like to see if we can
set myself up with a franchise.

37:03.326 --> 37:04.993
Now, I know it needs to be the right one,

37:05.061 --> 37:06.661
but if we start to thread that needle,

37:06.730 --> 37:08.129
I think all the noise will go away.

37:08.198 --> 37:10.300
Yes. But...

37:10.301 --> 37:11.798
What's going on with Sergeant Stone?

37:13.238 --> 37:14.804
They're trying to get a script together.

37:14.873 --> 37:16.862
And then they're going
out to Logan Travers.

37:17.676 --> 37:18.738
Come on.

37:19.044 --> 37:20.877
Listen, I agree, but he's half your rate.

37:20.946 --> 37:22.809
And the climate's changed, you know that.

37:23.259 --> 37:24.861
It's about franchises, not faces.

37:25.382 --> 37:27.515
And your face comes with some noise.

37:27.585 --> 37:29.451
Not the kind of noise that
everyone wants to hear.

37:29.621 --> 37:31.388
Can't we just push through that?

37:31.456 --> 37:32.722
I mean, do they know I'm interested?

37:32.791 --> 37:34.324
They do, but I won't go all in for you

37:34.393 --> 37:35.593
if I don't have the hand.

37:35.593 --> 37:37.226
If we lose, then the hole just gets deeper.

37:37.295 --> 37:39.693
- It's not worth the risk.
- I think it is.

37:42.807 --> 37:44.247
You and I go way back.

37:44.435 --> 37:45.896
Just asking for a favor.

37:46.738 --> 37:48.170
For old time's sake?

37:48.640 --> 37:49.790
Sure.

37:52.577 --> 37:54.235
Well, how far back do you want to go?

37:58.583 --> 37:59.968
That's not what I meant.

38:00.952 --> 38:02.111
No?

38:04.383 --> 38:07.994
Come on. Nice dinner,
beautiful bottle of wine.

38:09.327 --> 38:10.927
Some part of you wanted me to think

38:10.995 --> 38:13.056
about what used to always come next.

38:29.380 --> 38:30.971
Hey. How was dinner?

38:31.449 --> 38:33.352
Good. Yeah, good.

38:34.652 --> 38:35.667
Great.

39:06.975 --> 39:08.574
What do you need me to do?

39:16.508 --> 39:18.027
I have to go to Toronto.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.378
We'll talk when I get back.

39:41.319 --> 39:43.119
- Yeah?
- Okay, look, I know

39:43.187 --> 39:44.687
that you said that you were done...

39:44.756 --> 39:47.157
- And I meant it. <i>
- There's a name.</i>

39:47.658 --> 39:49.792
It should be in the IHM system.

39:49.861 --> 39:51.113
Julie Woolth.

39:51.596 --> 39:53.796
<i>- Can you try to locate her?</i>
- Megan.

39:53.865 --> 39:55.987
It's the last thing I'm
going to ask you to do.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.235
I promise.

39:58.339 --> 39:59.347
Okay.

40:00.307 --> 40:01.346
I got to go.

40:03.613 --> 40:04.855
Hey.

40:06.063 --> 40:07.088
