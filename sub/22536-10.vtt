WEBVTT

00:01.630 --> 00:03.450
Previously on
crisis...
Fbi tech:
You should see this, sir.

00:03.470 --> 00:05.597
Every news
outlet has it.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.329
That's the video
from the cia.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.695
(phone ringing)

00:09.710 --> 00:10.631
Yes.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.766
I'm coming for you.

00:11.770 --> 00:12.964
Say good-bye to

00:12.980 --> 00:14.834
Everything you love
while you can.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.829
What do you want from me?

00:15.850 --> 00:17.602
To destroy
widener.

00:17.610 --> 00:18.804
Don't let me sleep.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.107
I dreamed of
those people.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.519
The ones you killed in training?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.511
The ones they're sending me
to kill next.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.340
Francis (distorted):
I need your wife. I need a spy.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.681
I will save our son.

00:26.690 --> 00:29.557
You're asking me
to kill my son.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.949
What happened?
This is too soon.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.382
Mrs. Liao is the only one
who could've

00:33.400 --> 00:35.493
Stopped that virus.
She failed.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.695
The most important parent
mission is 5177/ to come.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.624
That parent must know
the price of fa/iure.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.733
Please don't.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.037
They made me do it.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.803
(gunshot)

00:58.750 --> 01:01.310
We don't know it's him.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.154
It's him.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.740
(horse whinnies)

01:24.750 --> 01:27.310
(horse snorting)

01:30.920 --> 01:32.114
You're the fbi?

01:32.120 --> 01:33.280
Special agent dunn.

01:33.290 --> 01:34.757
Finley.
Secret service.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.716
Okay. It's, uh...
(clears throat)

01:36.730 --> 01:38.152
...He's this way.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.124
Homeowner came out because
someone left the lights on.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.930
Found this.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.579
We're gonna need
the room, deputy.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.174
Of course.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.540
We did this.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.219
We killed
this boy.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.154
We stopped his mother from doing
what she was supposed to do,

02:09.160 --> 02:10.787
And we killed him.

02:10.790 --> 02:12.451
And how many people
would have died if we hadn't?

02:12.460 --> 02:15.156
Dunn, look at me.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.422
Gibson killed him.

02:16.430 --> 02:17.829
You remember that.

02:17.830 --> 02:19.969
When we catch him
and you look at him,

02:19.970 --> 02:21.631
You remember it was
him who did this.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.130
He put this
boy here.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.364
Okay, let's work the scene.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.005
(exhales)

02:32.280 --> 02:34.817
The victim is male,
approximately age 16.

02:34.820 --> 02:38.847
Single entrance wound,
mid-back, close range.

02:38.850 --> 02:39.919
No other signs of trauma.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.979
Appears to be
jin liao,

02:41.990 --> 02:44.754
A ballard school hostage.
Let's turn him over.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.430
Single exit wound.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.931
A handwritten note attached

02:59.940 --> 03:01.874
With the words,
"my mother failed."

03:01.880 --> 03:04.804
Gibson will want
the other parents to see this.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.142
So they know what happens
to their children

03:07.150 --> 03:08.845
If they don't do as he asks.

03:08.850 --> 03:13.082
Gibson wanted mrs. Liao to
stop our search for 12 hours.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.021
And she only gave him six.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.021
What's gibson
need six hours for

03:21.030 --> 03:23.055
So badly that
this kid had to die?

03:24.030 --> 03:26.521
(horse snorts)

03:26.540 --> 03:30.032
The chemical process
is the chemical process.
I can't make it go faster.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.804
If you want me to make this
compound, I need more time.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.005
The fbi and the national guard?

03:35.010 --> 03:36.898
_ At our door
In four hours, tops.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.314
They're closing
in on us.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.209
Why are we still here?

03:50.590 --> 03:53.423
Why are we still
here, francis?

03:53.430 --> 03:56.399
They have a ring
around this area five miles out,

03:56.400 --> 03:59.164
And it's closing fast.
We need to get out of here.

03:59.170 --> 04:01.229
No. You need to go
back to your lab and

04:01.240 --> 04:02.992
Finish your work.
What difference

04:03.010 --> 04:05.001
Does it make if I finish it?
We need to get the compound

04:05.010 --> 04:07.501
Into hawkins.
He's out there,

04:07.510 --> 04:11.105
We're here, and there are
10,000 armed men between us.

04:11.110 --> 04:12.600
Do you want to be free, jonas?

04:12.620 --> 04:15.077
Yes.
Of everything you've done?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.570
Yes.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.114
Do you want
to destroy widener?

04:18.120 --> 04:21.180
Yes. But they
will find us.

04:21.190 --> 04:24.284
I know.
They're gonna take
this place by force,

04:24.290 --> 04:25.848
And kill us all.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.748
Let me deal with that.
Just go back in the lab

04:27.760 --> 04:29.955
And finish your work.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.598
Open a secure line.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.532
I can't guarantee
it's secure.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.360
The feds are focusing
everything they have

04:40.380 --> 04:43.099
On this area. It's like an
electronic blizzard out there.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.702
Nothing is
secure anymore.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.940
I just needed
a little more time.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.043
And then I would have
finished this and that child

04:49.050 --> 04:50.608
Would still be alive.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.043
Why would his mother not do

04:53.060 --> 04:55.711
Everything possible
to protect her child?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.823
Open a line.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.994
(phone ringing)

05:06.600 --> 05:08.568
Hello?

05:08.570 --> 05:10.993
Yeah, yeah, he's here.
Hang on a second.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.229
Buddy, it's for you.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.673
Who is it?

05:15.680 --> 05:17.739
Some woman.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.399
Hello.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.639
Do you miss your son?

05:25.650 --> 05:29.279
Who the hell is this?

05:29.290 --> 05:32.350
(distorted):
Had you given up hope?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.999
You have no idea who
you're messmg wrth here.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.195
I know exactly
who I'm messing with.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.021
I know where you spent
those lost 14 years.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.598
If you know I did time
in leavenworth,

05:41.600 --> 05:42.760
Then you know what put me there.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.863
Lots of blood put you there.

05:44.870 --> 05:48.328
Then you know you should stop
talking about my family,

05:48.340 --> 05:51.343
Hang up the phone,
and stay out of my life.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.102
I know that you
gave your son your name

05:53.120 --> 05:54.872
And that you call him junior.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.610
I'll find you and gut you.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.339
I know you say to yourself
every day

06:00.360 --> 06:03.011
That you'll do anything
just to see him again.

06:05.390 --> 06:06.857
You can't know that.

06:06.860 --> 06:09.055
But it's true, isn't it?

06:11.130 --> 06:12.620
Yes.

06:12.630 --> 06:16.532
Well, buddy, here's your chance.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.360
What would you do

06:18.370 --> 06:21.066
To see your son again?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.469
Anything.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.087
Jin:
P/ease, you don’t
have to do this.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.978
Francis:
They made me do it.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.981
(gunshot)

06:42.730 --> 06:44.220
Ian?

06:44.230 --> 06:46.425
Ian, what's the matter?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.167
Come with me.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.605
What's going on?
Shh.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.770
Not yet.

07:13.390 --> 07:15.426
I think they listen to us.

07:15.430 --> 07:18.422
And I need to tell you something
and they can't hear it.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.792
You know how they take
your dad back there?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.368
Y-yeah.

07:24.370 --> 07:27.601
I found a hole in the wall.

07:27.610 --> 07:28.929
And I could see in.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.931
Ian, you're scaring me.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.804
They made him do something.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.674
What did they make him do?

07:36.320 --> 07:38.140
Jin liao didn't get out,
beth ann.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.618
Well, then where is he?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.451
He's dead.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.985
What are you talking about?

07:45.990 --> 07:47.855
Ian, what did you see?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.925
I saw your father
shoot jin liao.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.467
No. No. No, no, no, no,

07:54.470 --> 07:56.131
That couldn't
have happened.

07:56.140 --> 07:57.334
No, you're lying.
You're lying.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.739
(crying): No. No.

07:58.740 --> 07:59.934
They made him do it.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.430
He didn't want to.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.930
Oh, my god.
Who are these people?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.736
Why would they
make him do that?

08:04.750 --> 08:07.639
Why?
I've known your
dad my whole life.

08:07.650 --> 08:08.776
This wasn't him.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.441
It was them.

08:10.450 --> 08:11.678
They made him do it.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.339
You have to remember that.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.817
You can't tell anyone.
You can't tell anyone.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.959
No one can know, because they
won't understand. They won't

08:17.960 --> 08:20.053
Understand.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.690
Where are the authorities?

08:26.700 --> 08:28.099
Three miles out and closing.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.590
You have your gear ready?

08:29.610 --> 08:31.532
Yes.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.861
Hold out your hand.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.030
Hold out your hand.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.042
Good. Steady.

08:43.050 --> 08:45.939
Now tell me your name
and what unit you're with.

08:45.950 --> 08:49.556
The kidnapper wanted us
to find this boy's body.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.050
The light was left on so

08:51.060 --> 08:52.880
The homeowner would
come out and check. Now,

08:52.900 --> 08:56.620
The sign tells us that he'll
still be using the parents.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.995
It's important
to him that they know

08:58.000 --> 09:00.628
That unless they do what
he tells them to do,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.858
Their children will die.

09:02.870 --> 09:05.236
Like the cia massacre video,

09:05.240 --> 09:08.334
We can only assume that he'll be
releasing this online as well.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.002
The location where they
left him? Why there?

09:11.010 --> 09:12.875
That's the only
piece of good news.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.347
It's within the search perimeter

09:14.350 --> 09:16.739
Established by the fbi
and national guard.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.014
We don't think he can get out
any further than this.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.044
He's trapped.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.358
And we're closing in.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.578
We believe this is
the first time he's killed.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.320
He's been methodical
from the start, but

09:27.330 --> 09:30.219
We can expect his methods
to become more extreme.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.094
(indistinct radio transmissions,
servers humming)

09:38.670 --> 09:41.503
(beeping)

09:46.680 --> 09:48.079
What we believe was, one
of the kidnapper's calls

09:48.080 --> 09:50.344
Originated from within
the search grid 43

09:50.350 --> 09:52.079
Minutes ago. We did
not get content

09:52.090 --> 09:53.887
Or an exact origin
where the call came from.

09:53.890 --> 09:56.017
What did you get?
I can give you the phone number

09:56.020 --> 09:58.329
And exact address
where thchall went to.
o.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.622
You two take point on this.

10:01.630 --> 10:05.225
Take what you need
and hit it _hard.
Yes, srr.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.460
Male reporter:
Lots of activity emanating
from the capitol, with

10:07.470 --> 10:09.893
Hundreds-- perhaps thousands--
of fbi and national guard

10:09.910 --> 10:12.208
Conhnwng their search
for the ballard hostages.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.132
Female reporter:
In breaking news, another

10:14.140 --> 10:17.701
Horr/ﬁc image released on the
internet. What appears to he

10:17.710 --> 10:19.371
The dead body
of a ballard student

10:19.380 --> 10:22.042
Posted anonymously
in what must be a

10:22.050 --> 10:24.041
Heartbreaking sight
for his parents

10:24.050 --> 10:26.780
And all of us who wished
for these students' safe return.

10:26.790 --> 10:30.749
This makes the second gruesome
news release in two days.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.955
With Video of what
appears to he United States

10:32.960 --> 10:34.780
Special forces operatives

10:34.800 --> 10:38.566
Engaged in the massacre
of american women and children.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.492
Voices on capitol hi||
are calling

10:40.500 --> 10:44.266
For cia director widener
to answer questions as to what

10:44.270 --> 10:46.465
This video has to do
with the ballard kidnapping.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.505
Widener:
I'd be happy
to answer any questions

10:48.510 --> 10:50.171
The senate committee has.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.738
The cia has one mission--

10:51.750 --> 10:55.072
To protect this country
and its values.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.378
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting on tv)

10:59.620 --> 11:00.484
Federal agents!
On the ground now!

11:00.490 --> 11:02.287
Fbi! Move back!

11:02.290 --> 11:04.850
Get on the ground!
Down now! Move it!

11:05.490 --> 11:06.582
Put that gun down!

11:06.600 --> 11:08.420
(indistinct chatter)

11:08.430 --> 11:10.421
Back up! Gun down!

11:17.100 --> 11:18.931
Gonna need to see a warrant.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.498
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.000
That phone rang
90 minutes ago.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.604
All we want to know
is who took that call.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.976
This phone's been quiet all day.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.244
You're in the wrong place.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.457
Everyone got a target?
Yes, sir.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.368
A” head shots?

11:45.370 --> 11:47.292
Yes, sir.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.336
Finley:
I know these guys

11:49.340 --> 11:51.808
Just train and
train and train.

11:51.810 --> 11:55.029
How about you?

11:57.210 --> 11:59.405
Put 'em down.

12:00.850 --> 12:01.669
Put 'em down.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.874
Guns on the ground!

12:05.220 --> 12:06.983
On the ground.
Put them down.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.582
(indistinct chatter)

12:10.060 --> 12:11.584
Hands on the floor.

12:11.590 --> 12:14.058
Do it. No, no, no.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.096
(men groaning)

12:17.060 --> 12:18.698
You got them?

12:18.700 --> 12:19.894
Get on the floor.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.527
Right there.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.462
Spread your legs.
Spread them.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.933
The weapons have
been confiscated.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.477
All clear.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.344
No calls?

12:34.350 --> 12:37.069
That's funny, 'cause we know
a call came in here.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.273
Must be a mistake.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.542
Don't think so.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.553
Anybody hear the phone
ringing here today?

12:44.560 --> 12:46.050
No?

12:46.060 --> 12:48.085
Didn't hear anything?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.660
Didn't see anything?

12:52.100 --> 12:57.766
Did you see the news about a boy
found out in maryland?

12:57.770 --> 12:59.806
That dead yellow kid?

12:59.810 --> 13:02.005
What the hell do we care
about that?

13:04.040 --> 13:06.474
(yells)
(groaning)

13:12.620 --> 13:16.613
What the hell did you do to get
one of
them
as your partner?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.552
Dunn...

13:20.160 --> 13:22.219
Must have been
something real bad.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.788
Bartender:
Hey!

13:23.800 --> 13:25.392
Give me that back.
Hey!

13:25.400 --> 13:27.095
(bartender groaning)

13:27.100 --> 13:29.989
Right there, don't move,
don't move.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.068
You got no right.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.628
That's not yours, man.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.709
It is now.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.440
"you've all been
brothers to me,

13:40.450 --> 13:44.944
"family, and since
my son's been taken,

13:44.950 --> 13:46.781
"you're the only ones
who've been there for me.

13:46.790 --> 13:49.008
"I was offered a chance
to see my son again, so

13:49.020 --> 13:50.419
"I'm going to take it.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.079
"I know I was never
a good dad. Maybe

13:52.090 --> 13:54.581
I can do this. Keep up
the good fight. Buddy."

13:54.600 --> 13:56.295
Who is buddy?

13:56.300 --> 13:57.653
Iam.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.819
No.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.092
You're skip.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.419
Now, why don't

14:01.440 --> 14:02.498
You tell me buddy's last name?

14:02.500 --> 14:04.138
Yeah, it's, um...

14:04.140 --> 14:05.937
It's buddy screw-you.

14:05.940 --> 14:07.259
Man:
Agent dunn?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.704
Think you should see this.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.217
_Dunn: _
Plastic exploswe.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.542
Yeah, where's the other half
of that brick?

14:19.550 --> 14:22.713
(engine idling)

14:33.330 --> 14:34.524
(door opens)

14:34.540 --> 14:38.032
How long
before the fbi gets here?

14:38.040 --> 14:41.237
At this rate... 90 minutes.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.004
90 minutes.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.705
They won't come in.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.178
They'll set up a perimeter
and begin negotiations.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.478
And will you negotiate?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.139
Or are we going to die here?

14:52.150 --> 14:54.744
No one's going to
die here, jonas.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.354
There was blood
on these floors.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.419
Bullet holes in the walls.

15:00.590 --> 15:03.593
Theysent
oqr
_ soldiers
In to kIll me.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.867
Our own soldiers.

15:07.870 --> 15:11.260
Thayer made it in and took out
five before we stopped him.

15:11.270 --> 15:14.501
Hawkins killed
one of my men.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.535
And he remembered
his training,

15:16.540 --> 15:18.701
And he returned to
a secure location.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.406
I got deep enough into
widener's computer to know that,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.843
ButI need you now.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.580
You think I know where that is?

15:26.590 --> 15:29.115
Widener would have established
all new locations

15:29.120 --> 15:31.008
As soon as he discovered
that I wanted

15:31.030 --> 15:33.555
To blow the whistle on him,
move them every few days.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.255
I know that.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.626
New locations, but the people
working there are the same.

15:37.630 --> 15:40.292
People you've trained.

15:40.300 --> 15:43.428
Who would be taking
care of hawkins now?

15:44.540 --> 15:46.735
My lab assistant, ben auster.

15:46.740 --> 15:50.836
Write down his
cell phone number.

15:52.610 --> 15:56.774
I know they threatened
your daughter's life, francis.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.940
(paper rustling)

15:58.950 --> 16:01.544
But you know I had nothing
to do with that.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.670
(man groaning, phone beeping)

16:26.680 --> 16:28.500
(door opening)

16:28.520 --> 16:31.409
Auster, you got
to do something about him.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.411
I just checked on him.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.980
Then check on him again.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.021
There you are.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.093
(beep)

16:48.100 --> 16:50.534
(sighs)
I'm real sick.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.701
I know.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.701
I need the stuff.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.473
I don't have it.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.300
I can give you
something to sleep.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.847
No. No sleep.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.216
I don't want to dream.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.348
(loud, quivering panting)

17:06.350 --> 17:09.217
Woman:
We are able to _confirm now
that the Image

17:09.220 --> 17:11.552
Released earlier today online
is, in fact,

17:11.560 --> 17:13.323
The body of jin liao,

17:13.330 --> 17:15.457
A ballard hostage found dead
in the maryland countryside...

17:15.460 --> 17:17.155
Man:
With this going on, it's hard

17:17.170 --> 17:19.388
To believe the senate wants
to have hearIngs on the Cla.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.618
As my lawyer, I'd have thought
you'd have figured out

17:21.640 --> 17:23.335
That itis
_ because
thIs Is g0Ing on

17:23.340 --> 17:25.638
That the senate wants
to have hearings on the cia.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.335
They want to know
what the kidnapping

17:27.340 --> 17:28.876
Has to do with the cia,

17:28.880 --> 17:31.132
And now what this dead boy has
to do with cia.

17:31.150 --> 17:35.371
They want to talk to general
osborne, but he killed himself.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.508
They want to talk to jonas
clarenbach, but he's missing.

17:38.520 --> 17:41.512
And since your company
is a cia contractor,

17:41.520 --> 17:44.011
And you have a kidnapped child,
they can't wait to call you.

17:44.030 --> 17:48.729
I got my hands on a partial list
of questions you'll be asked.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.365
Where did you get this?

17:52.370 --> 17:54.167
Don't ask.
"how would you

17:54.170 --> 17:56.934
"characterize porter pearce's
relationship with the cia?

17:56.940 --> 17:58.931
"what programs,
unclassified and classified,

17:58.940 --> 18:01.431
"is your company
involved with?

18:01.440 --> 18:03.203
"do you know of any connection
between your company,

18:03.210 --> 18:05.007
The cia
and the ballard kidnapping?"

18:05.010 --> 18:08.241
To all of which you will invoke
your fifth amendment right.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.877
"what is your knowledge
of the american soldiers

18:09.880 --> 18:11.939
"found inside
the pakistani embassy?

18:11.950 --> 18:13.918
"what is your knowledge
of the massacre video

18:13.920 --> 18:15.751
"released on the internet?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.284
"have you had conversations

18:17.290 --> 18:19.758
With cia director widener
concernIng thIs VIdeo?"

18:19.760 --> 18:21.057
Invoke the fifth.

18:21.060 --> 18:22.425
"how would you characterize

18:22.430 --> 18:23.749
"your relationship
with your ex-employee,

18:23.770 --> 18:25.192
Dr. Jonas clarenbach?"

18:25.200 --> 18:26.599
Invoke the fifth.
"exactly what cia

18:26.600 --> 18:28.192
"program did dr. Clarenbach
work on?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.430
Do you know the whereabouts
of dr. Clarenbach?"

18:30.440 --> 18:32.203
Invoke the fifth.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.701
These questions at the bottom
seem a bit off-topic.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.804
The senate has you up,
meg, they're going to ask.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.141
"this committee has information

18:39.150 --> 18:42.574
"your daughter amber was
a closed adoption.

18:42.580 --> 18:47.244
"do you know the identity
of amber's parents?

18:47.260 --> 18:51.185
And if so, have you given
this information to the fbi?"

18:54.260 --> 18:57.798
(shutter clicks,
men talking indistinctly)

19:00.100 --> 19:02.967
Olsen:
That bar you're in is run
by aryans united.

19:02.970 --> 19:07.339
And aryans united is a full-on
anti-government hate group.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.729
Lots of violence,
lots of time in prison.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.970
We're coordinating
with gang task force

19:11.980 --> 19:13.470
To run down their roster.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.277
Any cia connection?
No.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.770
And no connection to ballard.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.077
We'll use the scan you sent

19:18.090 --> 19:19.443
To match handwriting,

19:19.450 --> 19:21.782
But every ballard parent
is accounted for,

19:21.790 --> 19:24.008
And none of the ballard fathers
is nicknamed buddy.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.452
Whoever he is,

19:25.460 --> 19:26.825
He's a dad, and he's out there

19:26.830 --> 19:29.492
With half a brick
of plastic explosive.

19:34.870 --> 19:38.169
(indistinct radio transmissions)

19:39.540 --> 19:42.429
Agent finley?

19:42.440 --> 19:46.046
(phone ringing)

19:46.050 --> 19:48.507
Meg.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.512
He killed a kid.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.841
I know.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.181
He just left that boy there.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.784
Just dumped him, susie.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.394
His parents, to see that...

20:02.400 --> 20:03.992
I know.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.025
I guess I always thought
gibson is a father;

20:06.030 --> 20:08.294
He'd never go through
with it.

20:08.300 --> 20:14.068
(voice breaking):
Susie, I don't think I'm going
to see amber again.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.372
All clear!
We're all clear!

20:17.380 --> 20:20.975
I have no idea how my
truck ended up out there.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.379
Stolen, I guess.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.211
Why don't you tell me
who buddy is?

20:24.220 --> 20:25.744
Don't know anybody named buddy.

20:25.750 --> 20:29.049
You understand
I am the director of the fbi.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.585
You know what's going on out
there, so you need to believe

20:31.590 --> 20:34.582
That I can put you in a hole,
and then I can

20:34.600 --> 20:37.353
Forget where that hole is,
so tell me

20:37.370 --> 20:39.691
What buddy has to do
with those ballard kids.

20:39.700 --> 20:42.066
Look at me.

20:42.070 --> 20:45.164
Do I look like I got anything
to do with that school?

20:46.840 --> 20:49.400
The other side of that roadblock
is inside our search grid.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.503
Why does gibson send
a parent through there?

20:51.510 --> 20:53.171
Gibson's bringing
this guy to him.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.171
If buddy's on foot,
then he's close.

20:55.180 --> 20:58.616
We need to tell our choppers
to center their search here.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.778
(helicopter blades whirring)

21:24.910 --> 21:26.275
It's done.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.804
Wait. Shh.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.448
Listen.
(distant helicopter
blades whirring)

21:30.450 --> 21:32.486
What? What?

21:32.490 --> 21:35.118
They're here.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.490
I'll be wanting the last four
digits of that bank account.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.593
Now.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.407
8-3-7-1.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.560
(typing)

21:56.910 --> 21:58.502
$25 million.

21:58.510 --> 22:01.104
You're mad.
The two of you.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.769
To think you'll be able
to spend that money.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.146
You hear what's above our head?

22:05.150 --> 22:08.415
Nothing's getting out of
here. Not that. And not us.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.293
They'll back off soon, jonas.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.961
They will back off...

22:19.970 --> 22:21.858
And will give us
a phone number to call.

22:21.870 --> 22:24.293
To negotiate.
Yes, to negotiate.

22:24.310 --> 22:28.337
They will ask us if there's
anything they can do for us.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.034
They will want
to be our friends.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.540
They will want to talk.

22:32.550 --> 22:35.678
I'm scared. Why aren't
you scared, francis?

22:35.680 --> 22:38.774
Iam.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.008
I'm terrified.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.189
Francis, that's 20 doses
you just loaded into there.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.395
I know.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.065
I'm going to need them all.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.878
I see them.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.741
Get away from the window.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.069
Get away
from the window.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.877
Where's my father?
Get down! Get down!

23:11.890 --> 23:14.245
Where's my father?
Get down.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.354
Quiet.

23:21.360 --> 23:24.659
Shut up. Just shut up.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.865
Putting you on speaker, red duke
one. Play that for the room.

23:26.870 --> 23:27.859
Copy that.

23:27.870 --> 23:29.235
This is 30 seconds ago

23:29.240 --> 23:30.593
Picked up
on our interceptor microphone.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.339
Gunman: _
Get away from the wmdow.

23:32.340 --> 23:34.262
Get away
from the window.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.407
Keep rolling, red duke one.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.173
I'm filtering for your rotors.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.102
Beth ann:
Where's my father?
Where's my father?

23:40.110 --> 23:41.805
I want analysis on those voices.

23:47.390 --> 23:49.551
What? No. What are you doing?

23:49.560 --> 23:52.120
Where are we going?

23:52.130 --> 23:54.052
I want _the satellite
lookIng down

23:54.060 --> 23:55.584
On those choppers right now.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.897
Onscreen...

23:56.900 --> 23:59.926
Now.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.466
Red duke one,
I need your gps again.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.165
We seem to be
In error here.

24:05.540 --> 24:07.235
Red duke one,
what are you seeing?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.902
We're over what appears to be an
abandoned military base,

24:09.910 --> 24:11.798
But I'm not reading it
on the map.

24:11.810 --> 24:14.699
I need your live image now.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.870
Coming to you now. We are live.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.815
You are looking
at what appears to be

24:19.820 --> 24:22.709
The base commander's house.
North end of an airfield.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.381
I want to look
into those windows.

24:24.390 --> 24:26.278
Angling for that now, sir.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.160
(kids screaming)

24:35.600 --> 24:38.990
We found them.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.501
Director olsen-- the satellite?

24:41.510 --> 24:43.933
What about it?
The feed was rerouted.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.736
That sat takes an optical
picture, but the feed

24:45.750 --> 24:47.399
Back to earth is digital.
It was rerouted.

24:47.420 --> 24:51.174
This is the true image
of those gps coordinates.

24:54.350 --> 24:56.750
Back those choppers off.
Establish a perimeter.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.979
Set up an incident command
center in one of those hangars.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.753
Get me a chopper.
I'm going out there.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.126
Get me finley and dunn.
And get me the president.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.825
Now. Move.

25:09.170 --> 25:11.365
You might want to
leave the room for a moment.
Why?

25:11.370 --> 25:12.359
What's about to happen?

25:12.370 --> 25:13.962
(grunting)
too late.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.175
Luke (grunts):
I have money.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.307
My dad does. Lots of it.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.846
He's a crook. Tons of money.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.340
(distorted):
When you get out of here...

25:21.350 --> 25:23.170
I'm getting out?

25:23.180 --> 25:26.479
Thank you. Thank you
so freaking much. Thank you.

25:26.490 --> 25:28.549
When you get out here,
you will feel very sick.

25:28.560 --> 25:29.879
Nothing they do will help.

25:29.890 --> 25:32.450
Sick. Why...
Why would I be sick?

25:32.460 --> 25:35.679
But if you hold on, if you
fight, you will come through.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.327
What's happening?

25:37.330 --> 25:38.797
Why will I be sick?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.290
What are you
gonna do?

25:40.300 --> 25:42.461
(grunts)

25:45.970 --> 25:48.768
He'll be out for
about two minutes.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.047
Hey, francis,
what are you doing?

25:54.050 --> 25:55.870
You know one massive
InjectIon won't work.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.472
It needs to be built up.

25:57.490 --> 26:01.312
I know that. Stop saying my name
and let go of my arm.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.652
If you know
that, then w

26:07.660 --> 26:12.199
You're gonna use this boy
to mule out the compound.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.065
You're gonna
smuggle it in his blood.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.492
That's why you need him so much.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.162
You're either with me,
or you're dead.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.718
Male reporter:
Massive amounts of_
manpower and materIal

27:16.730 --> 27:18.152
Pouring into this small area

27:18.170 --> 27:19.762
In the maryland countryside.

27:19.770 --> 27:22.159
And though there is
an fbi official news blackout,

27:22.170 --> 27:24.229
The indication is clear.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.504
There has been a big break
in the ballard hostage crisis.

27:26.510 --> 27:29.161
We now go to kirk,
who's somewhere now.
(phone rings)

27:29.180 --> 27:31.136
I understand you're, kirk,
you're out on the, uh,
yes?

27:31.150 --> 27:33.744
Road there where you're seeing
a lot of this manpower

27:33.750 --> 27:35.103
Being, uh, mobilized.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.974
Kirk: Exactly. We got word
at the station

27:36.980 --> 27:40.484
That a major convoy,
a major military convoy

27:40.490 --> 27:42.082
Was en route...
Hello?

27:42.090 --> 27:43.284
You watching this?

27:43.290 --> 27:44.951
Yes. Is it true?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.655
Is it them?

27:46.660 --> 27:48.855
Looks like it.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.327
Listen,

27:51.330 --> 27:53.525
I know this has been bad--
for your sister,

27:53.530 --> 27:54.997
For your daughter, for you.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.490
I don't think you do.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.934
Meg, you took
a physical beating.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.306
Even trained professionals
break more than bones.

28:01.310 --> 28:03.938
But this is coming to an end,
it's gonna be over soon, we need

28:03.940 --> 28:05.373
To think about what's going
to happen next.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.371
I thought that was
you going to jail.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.543
You need to listen
to your lawyer's adVIce, meg.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.438
Take the fifth.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.486
We can help each other
or we can hurt each other.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.687
Male reporter:
We have additional resources
from the station...

28:17.690 --> 28:19.055
You've already helped me.

28:19.060 --> 28:20.459
And how have I done that?

28:20.460 --> 28:22.325
You tracked how
gibson made money when the

28:22.330 --> 28:24.298
Worldwide market crashed.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.495
You hacked into my computers?

28:26.500 --> 28:28.320
When I gave you the name
of the kidnapper,

28:28.340 --> 28:30.137
I was curious to see
what you were g0Ing to do.

28:30.140 --> 28:32.563
I know you're
smarter than me, meg.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.299
Why wouldn't I just watch you

28:34.310 --> 28:37.006
To see what you were doing?
You found gibson's money.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.204
I found it, yes, but...

28:38.210 --> 28:40.508
But you didn't take it. Why?

28:40.510 --> 28:43.741
Because there's
a dead boy in the news.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.345
Because every attempt
we make, he beats us.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.818
I got a list of reasons,
but that isn't one of them.

28:49.820 --> 28:52.550
Because he doesn't have
your chIId.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.329
I just want my daughter back.

28:56.330 --> 28:57.319
Of course.

28:57.330 --> 28:58.558
You're her mother.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.391
But what happens
when she comes home?

29:01.400 --> 29:02.890
What do you want then, meg?

29:02.900 --> 29:05.869
I want my daughter back, gabe.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.998
I've lost my taste for beatings.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.940
Male reporter: ...In motion
to try to reach some resolution

29:16.950 --> 29:18.440
Regarding the...

29:18.450 --> 29:20.281
(indistinct chatter)

29:25.860 --> 29:27.680
Move out.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.768
If you're gibson
and you know you're trapped,

29:35.770 --> 29:37.590
Where do you send your
parent where you know

29:37.610 --> 29:39.430
He can do the most
damage today?

29:39.440 --> 29:42.409
I send him right here. He's
had our playbook from the start,

29:42.410 --> 29:44.298
No reason to think
he's not still using it.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.369
The satellite feed was rerouted.

29:46.380 --> 29:49.406
Choppers and drones did
flyovers but then called it in

29:49.420 --> 29:51.945
To local pd
to check out on foot.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.589
Those calls were rerouted
and marked all clear.

29:54.590 --> 29:57.411
And because the floor plans
were not public record,

29:57.420 --> 29:59.388
The released hostages'
descriptions

29:59.390 --> 30:00.880
Didn't match
any computer searches.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.128
Yes, sir.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.394
Thank you, mr. President.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.220
About to establish
communIcatIon.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.266
Hostage negotiation team
is here,

30:08.270 --> 30:09.737
But you two are point on this.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.093
You're the gibson experts.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.237
Understood.
And our mystery parent?

30:13.240 --> 30:15.128
We're tracking him from
his abandoned pickup truck

30:15.140 --> 30:16.437
Just outside the
search perimeter, but

30:16.440 --> 30:17.771
We think he's
headed here, sir.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.805
The bomb dogs are
here already.

30:19.810 --> 30:22.779
That plastic explosive
is not getting in.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.645
No id on_him?
No, Sll‘,

30:24.650 --> 30:26.515
We're looking for
a white male, nickname buddy.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.489
Get with security
and have them run every man here

30:29.490 --> 30:32.152
Through that filter
and then report back to me.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.152
It’s time
we
_started
makIng the calls.
Yes, sir.

30:41.330 --> 30:43.161
(breathing heavily)

30:43.170 --> 30:46.628
I'm sick.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.609
I'm real sick.

30:49.610 --> 30:51.498
Hang in there.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.978
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:53.980 --> 30:56.540
Man (over megaphone):
This is the fbi.
We are here in force.

30:56.550 --> 31:00.543
We want to talk with
the person In charge. We have

31:00.550 --> 31:02.142
An open line for you to call.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.880
We are here. We want to help.

31:05.890 --> 31:07.357
Everything ready?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.884
Yes, sir.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.427
Okay. Here we go.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.570
(overlapping chatter)

31:22.580 --> 31:24.536
(phone ringing)

31:24.550 --> 31:28.247
Don't call him gibson.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.741
Let him think he still
has total control.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.915
Quiet.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.717
Quiet!

31:35.720 --> 31:38.154
(chatter stops)
put it on the loudspeakers.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.025
This is fbi director
william olsen.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.351
Who do I have
on the line with me?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.749
Distorted voice:
Good afternoon, director olsen.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.194
First, let's start
with the ground rules.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.033
One-- nobody approaches us.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.702
This is for everyone's own good.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.598
The house is rigged to explode.

31:55.610 --> 31:59.000
Any trespass results
in detonation.

31:59.010 --> 32:02.548
This is assault 3 in position.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.110
Soldier:
Assault 3, go ahead.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.945
We have no visual targets,

32:08.960 --> 32:11.918
But we do have laser trip wires.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.251
Copy that. Maintain position.

32:14.260 --> 32:17.525
Lots of them.

32:17.530 --> 32:19.395
Copy that, assault 3.
We'll notify.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.867
They were ready for us.

32:20.870 --> 32:25.091
Two-- choppers and drones
out of our airspace.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.362
We'll send you images
from in here.

32:27.370 --> 32:30.407
You get to see more
than you want to.

32:30.410 --> 32:31.729
I can do those things for you.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.206
What will you do
for me in return?

32:33.210 --> 32:36.714
We have a very sick child here.
VVho?

32:36.720 --> 32:38.938
Is one more important
than another?

32:38.950 --> 32:40.815
I'm sorry. That's not fair.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.981
We all have our own priorities.

32:42.990 --> 32:46.653
Ours is to get this sick child
medical attention.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.753
Clear our airspace,
and he's yours.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.149
We'll come and get him.
Francis:
No. That's okay.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.297
We'll send him out.

33:07.350 --> 33:09.147
Let's go.

33:09.150 --> 33:11.311
Get up!
(gasping)

33:22.160 --> 33:23.354
I have one hostage

33:23.360 --> 33:24.429
And two targets.

33:24.430 --> 33:27.092
Am I green? Do I shoot?

33:27.100 --> 33:29.568
Man:
Negative. No shot. No shot.

33:32.710 --> 33:36.806
Francis (distorted):
Trip wires will be disabled
as the boy walks through them.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.199
You may get him
when we say so.

33:39.210 --> 33:42.099
All other movement results
in detonation.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.611
Can you tell us what's wrong
with him? It would help.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.885
He suddenly became
extremely ill.

33:51.790 --> 33:54.054
Go close on him.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.823
Quarantine a section
of the medical tent.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.865
Is cdc here?
Man:
On their way.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.963
Half an hour out.
Everyone near that boy

34:05.970 --> 34:08.632
Is in a full suit
until cdc clears him.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.403
Bioweapon?

34:10.410 --> 34:14.198
I'm not taking anything
gibson gives us as a gift.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.576
Go find out
what happened to that kid.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.438
You can have him now.

34:26.390 --> 34:28.585
(panﬁng)

34:44.080 --> 34:46.401
Hey, how you doing?

34:46.410 --> 34:48.901
It's okay.
We're here to help you.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.514
He said you'd say that.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.545
But you can't...

34:53.550 --> 34:55.415
You can't help me.

34:55.420 --> 34:58.480
(groans, machines beeping)

35:00.390 --> 35:02.756
Gibson is playing us,

35:02.760 --> 35:05.456
And he's using this boy
right here to do it.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.098
We need to find that parent.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.938
Dutton. Where the hell you been?

35:14.940 --> 35:17.374
Woman:
On vacatIon.

35:17.380 --> 35:20.304
Took me a week to get back here.
Where do they have me?

35:20.310 --> 35:22.369
Communications over there.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.916
What's with
the two lines?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.376
Just making sure

35:25.390 --> 35:27.984
Everyone who's here
is supposed to be here.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.397
(typing)

35:45.270 --> 35:47.067
This is swat secure 2819.

35:47.070 --> 35:50.437
I am on online and request
radio check of all units.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.170
Tactical first. Begin.

35:53.180 --> 35:55.808
How did you get her
in there?
She's one of them.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.708
She's a cop.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.849
Dunn.

36:09.860 --> 36:12.294
Go ahead.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.461
Partial print match
on the note.

36:14.470 --> 36:17.462
Delman birch,
marine. Vietnam.

36:17.470 --> 36:21.861
No connection to ballard
or any kId at ballard.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.508
No connection
to gIbson or Cla.

36:24.510 --> 36:27.308
Yeah. He's got one kid.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.005
They're looking for him now.
Thank you.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.476
They're sending
through his file.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.471
How did we miss
another parent gIbson could use?

36:32.490 --> 36:35.186
Delman birch. That name
sound familiar to you?

36:35.190 --> 36:37.909
Yeah. Where have we heard it?

36:48.370 --> 36:51.737
Here it is.

37:05.150 --> 37:06.378
Finley, right there.

37:07.420 --> 37:11.254
There's a pass
waiting here for me.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.892
(speed dialing)
how's the boy?

37:16.900 --> 37:18.891
Sick.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.368
Why don't you help us
so we can help him?

37:21.370 --> 37:24.430
(distorted):
You pump our children
full of lies.

37:24.440 --> 37:29.764
Then accuse us
of making them sick.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.372
You care for these children?

37:31.380 --> 37:33.678
But you're putting them
in harm's way.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.045
We do care for them.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.449
Then show us.

37:36.450 --> 37:39.214
Okay. But this goes both ways.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.517
Blue shirt right here.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.748
Man:
What?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.081
You can have five kids
right now.

37:44.090 --> 37:46.456
You have that power right now.

37:46.460 --> 37:48.280
Hey, I didn't do anything.
I swear.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.554
We only need one thing from you.

37:51.570 --> 37:55.563
Secret service agent
marcus finley. In here.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.435
Now.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.831
No other communication
untII that happens.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.143
Reporter:
We do know now the location

38:08.150 --> 38:09.378
Of the missing children.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.940
I'm ready to go back in.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.415
I'm done here.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.717
He might kill him.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.153
I don't think so.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.425
Gibson doesn't kill
for no reason.
JIn |Iao?

38:21.430 --> 38:23.819
For gibson, there was a reason.
His mother failed.

38:23.830 --> 38:26.628
Finley has been a thorn
in his side since day one,

38:26.630 --> 38:30.293
But if he'd wanted him dead,
he'd have done it by now.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.631
The kids are
gibson's power.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.460
If he's giving five of them up,

38:33.470 --> 38:35.563
It has to be for a bigger reason
than just killing finley.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.104
Well, I'd like to know
what that reason is

38:37.110 --> 38:38.634
Before we send him in there.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.106
I'd like to know
what that reason is

38:40.110 --> 38:41.577
So we don't get played.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.002
Why? Why do you need to know?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.942
It gets us five kids.
That's the reason.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.589
You don't want to know
why he's asking for you?

38:47.590 --> 38:49.080
I'll figure that out
when I'm in there

38:49.090 --> 38:50.455
And those kids are out here.

38:50.460 --> 38:54.282
Just like that?

38:54.290 --> 38:57.748
Just like that.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.093
(grunts)

39:02.500 --> 39:05.333
Beth ann, I tried.

39:05.340 --> 39:06.705
I know. I know.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.507
They're too strong.
I know.

39:10.710 --> 39:12.598
I tried to
keep you safe.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.100
I know. I know what you did.

39:14.110 --> 39:17.147
I know you did it
just to keep me safe.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.311
You know?
What do...?

39:19.320 --> 39:20.685
What do you know?

39:20.690 --> 39:22.487
Ian saw, dad.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.708
What happened
with jin liao.
Oh.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.618
But it's okay,

39:26.630 --> 39:28.382
'cause we're gonna
get out of here,

39:28.400 --> 39:30.288
And no one is ever, ever,
ever going to know about it.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.029
(crying)

39:32.030 --> 39:33.861
I can keep you safe, too.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.539
You find out what
buddy was doing

39:51.550 --> 39:54.678
And what's wrong
with luke.
Yeah, I got it,
finley.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.885
He's not done in here.
He knew we were comIng.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.312
I got it.

39:58.330 --> 39:59.888
Look, dunn, I want you
to know something.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.222
You're a good partner.

40:02.230 --> 40:04.528
Yeah, I mean, at least
I didn't shoot you, right?

40:04.530 --> 40:05.895
No, you didn't.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.868
Man:
Agent finley, sir?

40:07.870 --> 40:09.428
We've got a humvee waiting
to take you up there.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.896
It's about a thousand yards

40:10.900 --> 40:13.505
Across the runway,
and then you'll walk it in.

40:13.510 --> 40:16.536
it can be cleansed

40:16.540 --> 40:19.737
oh-oh, oh, oh

40:19.750 --> 40:22.776
my arms are tough

40:22.780 --> 40:25.669
but they can be bent

40:25.690 --> 40:31.515
they can be-ee, ee-ee-ee-ee

40:31.530 --> 40:37.526
and I wanna fight,
but I can't contend...

40:37.530 --> 40:40.795
Who's here from transport?

40:40.800 --> 40:44.292
That'd be me.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.632
I guess that's love

40:46.640 --> 40:49.939
I can't pretend

40:49.940 --> 40:52.977
I can't
pretend

40:52.980 --> 40:59.215
oh-oh, oh, oh-oh,
oh-oh, oh, oh

41:06.630 --> 41:09.986
hey, hey-hey-hey-hey-hey,
hey, hey

41:10.000 --> 41:12.798
whoa...

41:12.800 --> 41:16.668
hey, hey-hey-hey-hey-hey,
hey, hey-hey, hey

41:16.670 --> 41:19.639
hey, hey-hey

41:19.640 --> 41:21.961
oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

41:21.980 --> 41:25.734
oh, feel our bodies grow

41:25.750 --> 41:34.681
and our souls, they blend...

41:34.690 --> 41:37.579
yeah, love, I hope you know

41:37.590 --> 41:46.350
how much my heart depends...

41:46.370 --> 41:50.022
but I guess that's love

41:50.040 --> 41:53.168
I can't pretend

41:53.170 --> 41:55.661
I can't
pretend

41:55.680 --> 41:59.434
oh-oh, oh

41:59.450 --> 42:00.872
I guess that's love

42:00.880 --> 42:03.474
I can't pretend...

42:03.480 --> 42:05.016
He's here.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.716
I can't pretend

42:07.720 --> 42:10.484
oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

42:10.490 --> 42:13.618
I guess that's love

42:13.630 --> 42:16.849
I can't pretend.

42:16.860 --> 42:21.797
