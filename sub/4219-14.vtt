WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:01.417
Hey, how you feeling?

00:03.128 --> 00:05.088
This is the first day
I felt 100%.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.632
She said tonight's the night.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.595
Jones, Dawson. Go.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.931
I saw her cheating.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.018
Apparently one of your guys
went toe-to-toe with Vince Keeler.

00:22.064 --> 00:25.858
He's not gonna fight fair.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.076
Hey, Kelly Severide.

00:35.828 --> 00:38.287
Where's Katie? Where is she?

00:38.414 --> 00:42.291
Hey! I know you know something.
Huh? Where is she?

00:42.418 --> 00:44.752
- Where's my sister?
- Kelly!

00:46.380 --> 00:47.463
Come on.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.925
Relax.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.681
She's been missing
a day and a half, Erin.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.933
What the hell is that guy
doing walking around free?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.601
I know. Come here.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.398
Listen. You didn't hear this from me,
but we're tracking his phone, his car.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.358
Every move that's
gonna lead us to Katie.

01:07.484 --> 01:11.028
If you push, he pushes back,
and we never see her again.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.454
Memory loss, dizziness,
bleeding from the ear.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.081
That's all to be expected
with a cracked skull.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.752
So, uh, I'm good?

01:26.962 --> 01:31.424
No. Your skull and brain
are severely compromised,

01:31.550 --> 01:33.968
and they could be
for the rest of your life.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.805
- I feel fine.
- Until you get hit again.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.476
This doesn't just go away.

01:42.186 --> 01:45.438
If you were a football player, they'd be
talking to you about retirement.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.859
Let's go, Dawson!
You're falling behind.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.661
7:20.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.789
You got to break seven minutes
on test day or you don't pass.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.877
Hey, you shaved a few seconds off.
That's great.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.129
Stellar.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.132
- Dawson, what's going on?
- Nothing, we're good.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.968
Really?

02:57.094 --> 02:58.803
Look, beat me up and down
this course, Jones.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.930
Just know I'll never cheat.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.598
Don't worry,
I'm not ratting you out.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.600
You just keep riding
your dad's coattails.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.113
Pallets collapsed on Marty,
our operator.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.365
We tried to get to him,
but his shirt got caught.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.119
- You OK?
- Yeah.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.496
No matter what,
we need you with us right now.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.084
Casey, recon and secure him.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.420
- Got it.
- Squad, assist truck.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.964
I'm with Casey.
Mills, Capp, rig a Stokes basket!

03:35.090 --> 03:36.465
Yeah, on it.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.346
Where are the controls?
Mouch, get a handle on that.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.723
Herrmann, Otis, give me a hand!

03:52.858 --> 03:54.191
Shut down that belt!

03:56.737 --> 03:58.571
This thing's really fried.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.293
Stay with us, Marty.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.920
Watch your head.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.302
Not enough leverage.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.430
His shoulder's gonna separate
if that thing starts up again.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.223
Trying to disconnect it.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.310
Please, I don't want to lose my arm.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.104
If I loosen the roller assembly,
we can slide him out.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.818
Casey!

04:46.370 --> 04:49.705
Casey, grab the railing. Hey.
Grab it with your free hand.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.375
Mouch, stop that belt now.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.126
I almost got it.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.879
One, two, three.

05:06.348 --> 05:10.226
His skin's turning gray. We can get him
out, but it'll take time.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.560
Sounds like crush syndrome.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.230
Mouch, you sure you
got control of that thing?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.399
It's not pretty, but yeah.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.110
Clarke, Casey, we're gonna
back him out nice and easy.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.319
Copy that.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.530
Right, this is gonna hurt like hell,
but we got to do it.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.658
Backing up on three. One, two...

05:30.330 --> 05:32.498
- I got you.
- Cruz!

05:47.139 --> 05:48.305
Thanks.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.517
I'm just glad your head
wasn't in it.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.659
CPD's on to something, but until
Katie's found, I'd like...

06:08.785 --> 06:11.328
Not another word.
You do what you got to do.

06:12.289 --> 06:13.956
Clarke has this under control.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.500
Appreciate it, Chief.
Thank you.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.420
Kelly. We're gonna get her back.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.391
I should've been there.
I'm sorry, Kelly.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.393
Hey...

06:34.519 --> 06:37.980
This isn't on you, Otis. Really.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.941
Let's just find her, OK?

06:54.998 --> 06:57.291
Kelly. What are you doing?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.585
Nothing, I'm... I'm good.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.213
Well, you look like a man
on a mission to me.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.299
What's up?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.889
I'm gonna find my sister.
I have an idea.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.767
Call the cops.
Let them handle it.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.395
Shay, if you were missing, would you
want me to sit around waiting for...

07:23.193 --> 07:25.027
No, I'd...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.363
I'd want you out there.
I... I just...

07:28.615 --> 07:30.324
Be careful, would you?

07:38.667 --> 07:42.044
- Hey.
- Hey. How's he doing?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.214
Like us all.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.717
Wishing he could do more,
and feeling useless.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.469
Listen, I know we made dinner plans

07:50.595 --> 07:53.597
so you can meet my friends,
but it can wait.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.017
No, let's keep it.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.311
- I could use something normal.
- Yeah?

08:00.814 --> 08:04.316
So you're not nervous
to meet my friends?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.488
Not until just now.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.742
Why would anybody target
a firefighter's sister?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.578
I mean, we're the good guys.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.123
Sometimes the world goes upside down
and there's no reason why.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.252
Big dog's out today.

08:23.378 --> 08:27.548
Deputy District Chief Lionel Jones,
Rebecca Jones' dad.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.217
That right?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.595
All her brothers
are lieutenants, too.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.847
CFD runs in her blood.

08:34.973 --> 08:37.141
Probably explains why
she's aced every test.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.269
Huh, yeah.
I'm sure that's it.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.616
- Tommy.
- Oh, the fireman.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.743
I need your help.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.994
I'm sorry, I can't...

08:57.120 --> 08:59.330
I need your help like you needed help

08:59.456 --> 09:02.333
when Keeler was beating your ass
before I jumped in.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.335
- My sister went missing after that.
- What?

09:04.461 --> 09:07.338
Keeler came by the next day
and he took her. Hey!

09:09.216 --> 09:11.008
- My sister is gone.
- He will kill me, man!

09:11.134 --> 09:14.053
Listen, listen.
You have my word, Tommy.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.888
Nothing came from you.
Who do I see?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.518
Jack Gatins was there
that night for Keeler.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.813
OK, now Gatins lays low, so the cops
might not know him.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.191
But Keeler can't scratch himself
without Jack.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.944
- OK? He'd know.
- Where's he stay?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.530
Next to a money store. OK?
Polk and Western.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.457
Gatins.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.382
- Where's Katie?
- Oh! Uh!

09:51.508 --> 09:55.469
- You want me to ask again?
- Ask away, boy scout.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.069
I can do this all morning, but this
ends now. Where is she?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.534
Next one doesn't miss.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.875
Lindsay, I know where she is.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.922
It was Keeler,
the guy from the blackout.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.800
- You're sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:17.886 --> 11:21.138
I could see under his hood when...

11:24.184 --> 11:26.060
When he was...

11:30.607 --> 11:32.441
When he was what?

11:34.652 --> 11:38.072
Kelly, can I talk to her
alone for a minute?

11:44.662 --> 11:46.580
I love you, Katie, OK?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.839
Mrs. Nolan, she's... She's OK.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.719
Her life was going along just fine
until you came into it.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.556
Just like Benny,
wrecking everything that's good.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.225
Maybe if you'd paid
your daughter a tenth

12:06.351 --> 12:08.268
as much attention as you did
the volleyball twins,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.104
you'd actually know her.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.738
What'd he do to her?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.076
It's bad.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.796
Is she...

12:35.922 --> 12:37.047
She's OK.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.050
She's, uh, she's banged up,
but she's OK.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.219
You should go see her.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.182
Yeah.

12:51.396 --> 12:55.232
She, uh, probably needs
some time, so...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.653
Maybe later.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.748
- How's it going?
- Seven minutes.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.460
I just got to
get through this damn test

13:14.586 --> 13:16.795
in seven minutes, right?
How hard can that be?

13:16.921 --> 13:20.507
I mean, it's not like
I've actually ever made it before.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.718
Stop. Hey, hey.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.180
Look, you can do this.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.641
Thank you.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.562
Oh, hey, how was your check-up?

13:33.688 --> 13:35.564
Everything's perfect.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.902
You just have to concentrate on what you
have to do at the Academy.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.493
Yeah.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.918
So I come running out,
stripping my gear off,

13:56.044 --> 13:57.836
and I mean, all of it,

13:57.962 --> 14:00.380
and as I'm standing there
buck naked,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.674
getting hosed down.
I look over,

14:02.800 --> 14:06.011
and there is a live news camera
looking right at me.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.137
Oh, no.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.805
They blurred out
all the important parts

14:08.932 --> 14:11.433
for the 10:00 broadcast,
but you get the picture.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.520
10 bucks says that that raw footage
is still on the Internet, babe.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.147
All I need is for my boy Jimmy
to see that.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.527
- You have kids, Wallace?
- Yes, a stepson, previous marriage.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.029
You were married before?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.532
Yeah, I was.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.785
Twice, actually.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.955
Hmm.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.835
Um, can you imagine the trouble
that we would've gotten into

14:38.962 --> 14:40.879
if we had camera phones
when we were kids?

14:41.005 --> 14:43.048
Girl, don't even start.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.759
Hey, Clarke, another drink?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.678
- No, I'm good.
- Thank you.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.180
How about you boys?
Some more milk?

14:51.266 --> 14:54.434
- Yeah, if you don't mind.
- You know, this is a bar.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.687
- It's not a Chuck E. Cheese.
- Shay.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.272
Jeff's had enough.
We should go.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.774
No. Tonight's on me.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.818
All right, I got the tip.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.403
This is a small tab.

15:06.531 --> 15:09.575
- Baseball tickets? Seriously?
- Hockey.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.536
You know, some people tip
with actual money

15:12.662 --> 15:16.582
so that other people can pay
for things, like rent.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.084
- OK, let's go, guys.
- See you on shift.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.964
Yeah, thanks a lot.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.300
Hey, do you have any idea
who those guys were?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.926
Clarke's boy scout buddies?

15:28.052 --> 15:31.138
That was Brent Seabrook and Duncan Keith
from the Blackhawks!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.557
Great. So they're cheap, too.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.059
Are you... They...

15:38.396 --> 15:40.647
We are all relieved
that Katie is safe.

15:42.734 --> 15:47.404
But this Keeler, long as he's out there,
we need to stay vigilant.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.906
So be aware of your surroundings.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.996
Ambulance 61,
person in distress, 2200 West Franklin.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.793
So I heard you're thinking about having
a lesbo night at Molly's.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.670
Eh. Yeah, I'm having second thoughts.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.256
I mean, lesbians are notoriously
light drinkers.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.258
You really got to
pack 'em in to break even.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.594
Hmm, I did not know that.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.015
What?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.935
You just seem
unusually interested.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.063
I am not interested.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.650
Are you thinking about
coming out to me, Rafferty?

16:24.776 --> 16:26.360
- Because if you are...
- Just drive.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.905
Over here, quick.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.992
- What is your name, sir?
- His name's Jacob.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.620
All right, Jacob, do you have
a history of asthma,

16:36.746 --> 16:39.164
COPD, medication, inhalers?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.166
No. None of that.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.295
Whoa.

16:46.297 --> 16:51.301
- We're just trying to help you, OK?
- I told you, no 911.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.513
- No what?
- He's praying.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.640
He prays a lot.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.353
Jacob, are you declining treatment
for religious reasons?

17:03.231 --> 17:06.733
OK, I understand, all right?
And I respect your beliefs.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.112
I do. But look, the law says
that if we're called,

17:10.238 --> 17:12.155
we've got to check your vitals.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.367
You don't want us
to get written up, do you?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.494
OK, all right.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.287
All right, Jacob,
just let us do this,

17:19.414 --> 17:21.581
and we'll get out
of your hair, all right?

17:22.291 --> 17:23.792
Breathe slow, slow.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.003
I'm hearing rales.
He's filling with fluid.

17:27.130 --> 17:31.299
OK, Jacob, Jacob. You're experiencing
pulmonary oedema.

17:31.426 --> 17:32.926
Do you know what that means?

17:33.052 --> 17:36.054
If you don't let us help you,
you will die.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.598
It's His...
It's His will.

17:40.268 --> 17:43.270
- Do something!
- We can't, OK? We don't have consent.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.856
Jacob, look at me.
This is what's happening, OK?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.650
Your lungs, they are filling
with fluid, all right?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.569
You're drowning from the inside

17:50.695 --> 17:52.612
and in one minute,
your heart's gonna stop.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.239
Do you get me?

17:54.365 --> 17:56.658
This is the last minute
of your life.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.577
Let us save you.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.036
All I need is a nod.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.625
OK, OK, that's a nod.
Get a line in.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.336
- No, Rafferty. I don't think...
- He wants to survive.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.050
Ma'am, we just need you to hold him down
for us, OK?

18:17.388 --> 18:20.140
All right, line's in. Draw 80 milligrams
of furosemide.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.144
I can't get the nitro in.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.482
He's going into V-tach.
We got to get him down.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.110
Help me lower him?
One, two, three.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.154
Now, get that pillow under his head.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.864
Ready, push it now.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.751
OK, let's get you some air, sir.

18:53.049 --> 18:57.135
Some people need help.
Even when they don't realize it.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.021
Uh, not so fast, Christopher.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.024
This just in from headquarters
for you.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.359
For me?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.278
Says "Christopher Herrmann"
on the front, doesn't it?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.990
That it does.

19:26.958 --> 19:31.795
Hey, just wanted to say
how happy I am Katie's OK.

19:33.631 --> 19:34.923
Yeah.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.928
Say, um... Gabby said she's been
struggling with the timed test.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.763
Didn't you at some point or another?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.682
No, I set the course record.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.646
- Actually, pretty sure that was me.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.190
No, she's...
She's holding her own.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.150
- You'd be proud.
- All right, good.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.905
- How you feeling, by the way?
- Doc said I'm 100%.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.911
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.758
Please, my daughter's trapped in there!

20:21.512 --> 20:23.805
All right, we got one in the back,
possible neck trauma.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.473
All right,
backup ambulance on its way.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.060
Otis, stabilize her.
Truck, get all extinguishers ready.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.938
- On it, Chief.
- Hi. What's your name?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.274
- Nicole.
- Hi, I'm Brian.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.777
Nicole, I'm gonna wrap this around your
neck, OK? It'll keep you safe.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.613
OK, good. Careful, careful.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.824
Now, Nicole, if you don't
mind me saying,

20:42.950 --> 20:45.535
your hat looks a lot
like a snowmobile.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.495
How about we remove it
for you, OK?

20:54.462 --> 20:55.879
Uh, we gotta move this thing now.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.634
- Mills, grab the chains.
- Yeah, on it.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.304
Hey. Hey.
I'm not going anywhere, OK?

21:09.352 --> 21:11.561
Chief, we got fuel in here.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.106
Mouch, Herrmann, cover Otis.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.526
Here.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.284
Come on, let's get
this thing moving.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.412
All right, we're hooked!

21:31.374 --> 21:33.291
Hey, you ready, Otis?

21:33.417 --> 21:36.544
All right, Nicole,
this party's getting a little boring.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.213
What do you say we blow this joint?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.007
All right, nice and slow!

21:57.108 --> 21:59.150
Otis, get out of there!

21:59.276 --> 22:01.069
Here we go.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.703
You're OK.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.496
Careful with her.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.465
Chief.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.884
Hell of a job out there today.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.596
I know the last few days
have not been easy.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.349
About that...

22:32.727 --> 22:34.394
I think I need a couple hours.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.480
Yeah.

23:15.019 --> 23:18.480
- Hey, you wanted to see me, Chief?
- Hey, yeah, come on in.

23:18.606 --> 23:22.275
Um, it's safety day
over at the elementary.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.819
- You ready for that?
- Ready to go.

23:24.945 --> 23:28.740
- Good. That is a good thing.
- It is.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.454
I, um... Saw Donna earlier.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.790
Things OK?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.834
Yeah. Too OK.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.088
- Too OK?
- Relationships...

23:43.214 --> 23:47.467
Always end up screwing that stuff up.
It's in my DNA, I guess.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.597
I haven't even spoken
to Jimmy in months.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.307
So call him.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.392
I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.562
Thanks.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.871
Yeah, Jimmy. Wallace.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.998
Uh-huh. How you doing?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.462
Yeah, I know, I know.

24:26.841 --> 24:29.968
I know I've been pretty...
Pretty out of touch.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.683
Yeah. We'll talk.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.154
Oh, Shay, I almost forgot.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.322
How was your first night
holding down the bar?

24:52.908 --> 24:54.242
What?

24:55.703 --> 24:57.996
OK, new rule.
Cash tips only,

24:58.122 --> 25:01.082
not things like tickets to outdoor
hockey games in March, in Chicago.

25:01.208 --> 25:07.839
Oh, these are for the NHL stadium series
at Soldier Field, center ice!

25:07.965 --> 25:09.716
I will gladly
relieve you of those.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.467
Not so fast.
The tip was left at Molly's.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.846
- Partners get first crack.
- Those sell for like 800 bucks apiece.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.683
OK. Bidding starts there.
Who wants them?

25:18.809 --> 25:20.351
This lady needs
a new pair of shoes.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.645
Too rich for my blood.

25:24.064 --> 25:27.650
Fine. I'll just sell them online.
Then I'll make a date with Jimmy Choo.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.027
Jimmy who?

25:30.112 --> 25:31.696
Who tips with tickets like those?

25:31.822 --> 25:36.034
Oh, Clarke's buddies. Duncan Keith
and Brent Seabrook, that's who.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.788
Wow, aren't you full
of mysteries?

25:40.915 --> 25:42.665
Yup.

25:54.261 --> 25:57.388
- Hey, what's going on?
- I'm under review.

25:57.514 --> 26:00.808
Jacob, our devout friend,
he just filed a complaint.

26:00.935 --> 26:03.019
You saved his life.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.189
Yeah, well, that detail
doesn't really seem to matter.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.107
Well, we're gonna appeal.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.026
Shay...

26:10.152 --> 26:12.320
I'll shout it from
the rooftops if I have to.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.447
Let's just see how this plays out.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.619
Final time trial starts now!

27:00.077 --> 27:01.703
Next obstacle.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.338
Uh... Uh!

27:12.464 --> 27:15.800
- Uh! Stuck! Damn it!
- Here, I got it.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.219
Thanks.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.013
Go!

27:25.311 --> 27:26.519
Aah!

27:48.042 --> 27:50.585
Yeah, good job, Jones!

27:50.711 --> 27:53.004
Let's go, Dawson.
You lost time. Move it.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.845
Come on, Dawson!

28:07.561 --> 28:10.229
Dawson.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.530
I'm sorry.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.714
- Dad, this is Gabriela Dawson.
- Chief.

28:36.840 --> 28:40.593
Don't get up. I'm sorry to see
you didn't pass.

28:41.804 --> 28:42.970
Thank you, sir.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.681
Well, CFD's not right
for everyone.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.768
Best you know now
what you're capable of.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.687
That's what I've been trying
to teach my daughter.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.031
I'm sorry about that.

29:02.157 --> 29:05.201
He didn't want me to pass either.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.663
He thinks that the only thing
female firefighters

29:08.789 --> 29:10.915
are fit to handle
are male firefighters.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.168
What an asshole.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.878
Tell me about it.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.883
That's why I cheated.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.846
I can't let him win.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.575
- Hey.
- You're up early.

29:45.701 --> 29:49.162
Fourth grade progress reports
know no master.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.830
Ha.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.291
Uh, listen. I don't want
to pile it on,

29:53.417 --> 29:56.002
but my parents are in town Sunday.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.462
Donna...

29:57.588 --> 30:00.965
I just thought things
were going so well, why not?

30:01.091 --> 30:04.093
Things are going well.
They are.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.804
That's because
I'm really good at this part.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.308
The beginnings
of relationships.

30:11.518 --> 30:16.439
But eventually I always find
a way to destroy them.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.942
The past is the past, Wallace.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.279
Yeah, 10, 20 years ago,
I'd have told myself that, too.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.823
But I've seen the pain I've caused.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.285
Two marriages, a stepson who barely
wants anything to do with me.

30:30.537 --> 30:34.415
I got a lot of baggage, Donna,
and I can't put you through that.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.168
I won't.

30:37.294 --> 30:40.922
Don't you think I can decide that
for myself?

30:43.926 --> 30:45.384
I'm sorry.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.953
Three-month suspension.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.579
Wait, what?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.915
Did... Did you tell them
the whole story?

31:16.041 --> 31:19.126
I told them what happened,
that I didn't wait for consent.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.753
But it was more complicated
than that.

31:20.879 --> 31:25.716
No, it wasn't.
Anyway, it's done.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.760
OK, what about an appeal?

31:27.886 --> 31:30.388
I requested Dawson
to replace me as PIC.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.558
Shay...

31:33.684 --> 31:39.272
I've spent the last six months trying
to bring my fiancé back from the grave.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.733
I need some time.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.489
OK, but there are better ways than
getting your ass suspended, you know?

31:48.615 --> 31:49.907
Yeah.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.996
But you and me would have
eventually gotten into

31:55.122 --> 31:56.872
a huge fight sooner or later.

31:56.999 --> 32:00.501
You know, ending in an ugly divorce
and the whole thing.

32:00.627 --> 32:04.046
True. You're probably right.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.092
OK, well, I'm gonna give
you a hug now.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.469
Eh...

32:19.146 --> 32:20.438
- Hello?
- Kelly.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.607
You're gonna want to see this.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.692
Where?

32:25.652 --> 32:28.321
I'm moving into position.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.948
How is your sister?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.620
She's hanging in there.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.749
What happened to your hands?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.170
Training.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.340
Car's pulling in.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.763
Here we go.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.723
We'll wait for your move, Erin.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.439
Go, go, go!

33:07.611 --> 33:10.988
- Hands on the dash!
- Chicago PD!

33:12.032 --> 33:13.824
Get 'em out! On the dash!

33:13.950 --> 33:15.284
Let's see your hands.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.495
Driver and passenger, open your doors!

33:19.039 --> 33:21.248
- Open 'em! Hands out!
- Slowly!

33:22.834 --> 33:24.377
Passenger, open the door!

33:26.129 --> 33:28.089
Put your hands out
where I can see 'em. Up!

33:40.686 --> 33:42.186
Turn around!

33:45.023 --> 33:47.858
- That was for Katie.
- Ah.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.178
- I'm just here for a few minutes.
- It's OK.

34:16.430 --> 34:19.390
Actually, I owe you an apology.

34:19.516 --> 34:24.395
The other day, I was the mother of
a very badly hurt 21-year-old daughter.

34:24.521 --> 34:28.023
No, I... I understand
and I'm sorry, too.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.360
- What I said...
- Was right.

34:33.488 --> 34:37.408
I'll admit, I have not always
been the most attentive mother.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.911
But that is gonna change.

34:41.037 --> 34:42.913
That's good to hear.

34:47.294 --> 34:53.299
Kelly, before you go in there,
there's something else you should know.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.139
- Hey!
- Hey, sis.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.849
So...

35:03.518 --> 35:05.227
Heard they're busting you loose
tomorrow.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.521
Yeah, all the way to Colorado.

35:09.149 --> 35:13.068
It's good, really.
Like, my mom was sincere.

35:13.195 --> 35:18.574
Every time I close my eyes
or I try to read a magazine

35:18.700 --> 35:21.494
or just do anything at all,

35:21.620 --> 35:23.954
it all comes flooding back.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.168
Time away
is the right thing, Kelly.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.590
You tell Otis?

35:35.717 --> 35:36.842
Yeah.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.345
Take care of him for me, OK?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.368
- Whoa!
- You got that?

36:02.494 --> 36:03.702
Yeah, I'm all right.

36:03.829 --> 36:07.248
And... Shazam!

36:09.209 --> 36:12.086
Hey, buddy, look who's joined us.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.923
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.509
Glad you made it. Grab a hammer.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.028
You're gonna retake it.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.030
I don't know.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.783
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.

36:44.411 --> 36:48.998
Listen. You're disappointed.
That's gonna pass.

36:49.124 --> 36:53.085
Deep down, are you
a firefighter or not?

36:55.088 --> 36:56.630
You're a firefighter?

37:02.804 --> 37:04.722
Not yet, but just wait.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.731
What's up, bud?
Here you go, Nathan.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.150
Thanks for coming, Kelly.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.820
Yeah, are you kidding me?
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.281
So where are those
supposed to go?

37:23.700 --> 37:25.743
We got a surprise for you.
Come on.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.086
What is it?

37:37.297 --> 37:38.339
You'll see.

37:40.717 --> 37:41.926
Hey.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.261
All right, everybody,
gather round.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.222
Hey, guys,
come on down here.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.062
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

37:54.314 --> 37:58.734
A few weeks ago, our firehouse
was in danger of being shut down.

37:58.860 --> 38:03.989
And it would've been if this little man
hadn't come by armed with nothing

38:04.115 --> 38:05.866
but a thermos of soup and an idea.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.038
When we found out that your school
had lost its library,

38:11.164 --> 38:16.043
it was our honor
to build you a new one.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.261
- You did this for us?
- Yeah, we all did.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.390
That's awesome.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.018
Well, come on!
Come in and have a look.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.021
Hey, that library's
gonna need new books, you know.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.315
Yup. Bye-bye, Jimmy.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.409
- A couple beers, please.
- Beers, huh?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.911
Ooh, the boy scouts
are really stepping out.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.834
All right, all right.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.627
Here we go.
Raffle time!

38:59.963 --> 39:01.463
OK, here we go.

39:02.716 --> 39:07.511
And the hockey tickets
go to one-two...

39:07.637 --> 39:09.555
- Uh-huh.
- Two!

39:12.434 --> 39:13.767
Oh, yeah.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.273
Wow, OK. Well, I want to thank you
all for coming

39:19.399 --> 39:22.109
and raising money to buy books
for the new library.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.281
You know, sometimes people
need a little help.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.993
Whether they know it or not.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.664
- So thanks.
- Hear, hear.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.125
Right. A little bird told me

39:38.251 --> 39:41.920
that Herrmann's lieutenant test
results came back.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.757
Care to share, Christopher?

39:44.883 --> 39:46.550
Oh, OK. No?

39:46.676 --> 39:48.218
All right, um...

39:54.768 --> 39:56.226
I got a 70.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.646
Which means I passed!

40:05.361 --> 40:07.613
Hey, yeah, oh!

40:07.739 --> 40:09.239
Well done, man.

40:11.201 --> 40:13.535
That's right. Good enough.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.331
- Thanks for your enthusiasm.
- Congratulations, brother.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.752
OK.

40:23.213 --> 40:26.840
So Jeff's filled us in on everything
you've been doing for the school.

40:26.966 --> 40:27.925
Hmm.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.385
We talked about it,
and we think you deserve another tip.

40:31.638 --> 40:34.056
Don't go selling those ones.
These are for Molly's owners only.

40:34.182 --> 40:36.100
We'd like you guys
to be our guests at the game.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.603
Thank you, guys. Seriously,
thank you. That's so sweet.

40:39.729 --> 40:40.771
You bet.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.194
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.072
I just had
to get off my foot.

40:50.198 --> 40:51.448
You OK?

40:51.574 --> 40:53.867
Yeah, more than ever.
I'm ready to do this.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.121
Listen, um...

40:58.206 --> 41:00.666
After the fight
with Keeler's guy,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.501
my ear started bleeding.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.837
There was some swelling
around the first injury.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.755
Doc cleared me for work,

41:06.881 --> 41:09.967
but she said next time
I might not be so lucky.

41:12.637 --> 41:13.846
Why didn't you tell me?

41:13.972 --> 41:17.099
I didn't want to take away
from your focus on the Academy.

41:17.225 --> 41:21.186
This is just a job.
What we have is everything.

41:21.312 --> 41:25.315
I know. Never again. Promise.

41:25.441 --> 41:28.068
Gabriela,
Lieutenant Casey?

41:28.194 --> 41:30.612
Lieutenant Casey,
I'm Rebecca Jones.

41:30.738 --> 41:34.616
Hi. We just got our assignments
and I'm the new candidate on Truck 81.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.953
Oh! Welcome.

41:43.960 --> 41:48.005
Kelly, listen,
I don't know the whole story,

41:48.131 --> 41:50.883
but Keeler's got a hook
in somebody higher up the food chain.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.218
So what?

41:53.344 --> 41:55.429
So they're telling us
to cut him loose.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.600
- Tell them they can go to hell.
- I did.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.519
But he's still walking.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.025
You do something, Erin,
or I will.
