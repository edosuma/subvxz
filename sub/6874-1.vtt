01:15.983 --> 01:17.519
I got nothing.

01:18.552 --> 01:20.654
Just rocks.

01:20.787 --> 01:23.990
Some sand and more fucking rocks.

01:24.124 --> 01:26.861
Thank you, Sergeant
Hunter, AKA Captain Obvious,

01:26.993 --> 01:28.995
for the most impressive Sit-Rep.

01:29.129 --> 01:30.364
I'd completely failed to notice

01:30.498 --> 01:33.067
the extensive rock population, myself.

01:36.871 --> 01:38.105
An outcropping to the right.

01:38.239 --> 01:39.674
You see what I'm seeing?

01:41.374 --> 01:42.977
Holy shit.

01:43.111 --> 01:44.645
Up 200 meters.

01:46.748 --> 01:50.350
Well, well, well, the boy
came out to play after all.

01:56.323 --> 01:57.325
Are we compromised?

01:57.457 --> 01:58.626
Negative.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.269
The fuck are they doing down there?

02:24.317 --> 02:25.151
Shit.

02:25.285 --> 02:26.853
Ease up. Keep eyes on.

02:37.231 --> 02:38.266
He's on the move.

02:38.399 --> 02:39.867
Can you get a head shot from here?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.536
We need to take this fucker
out and avoid hitting the kid.

02:42.568 --> 02:44.037
I don't have a clear shot.

02:44.171 --> 02:45.739
He's got a kid with a bomb,

02:45.873 --> 02:47.340
that could sneak into any market place,

02:47.474 --> 02:48.775
from here to Kandahar.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.544
Take the shot.

02:51.679 --> 02:54.715
You wanted the pink mist, it's yours.

02:54.849 --> 02:56.451
Take the shot.

03:00.321 --> 03:01.456
Control your breathing.

03:03.156 --> 03:04.190
Take the shot.

05:20.995 --> 05:22.163
We there yet?

05:24.031 --> 05:25.565
This doesn't look like the ocean.

05:25.699 --> 05:27.300
There's too many trees.

05:27.433 --> 05:29.936
Just hang on, we're making good time.

05:30.070 --> 05:31.137
Is this really you guys?

05:31.272 --> 05:32.706
Yep, semper fi.

05:32.839 --> 05:34.374
Yeah, okay, seriously though.

05:34.507 --> 05:35.709
Do you understand how many

05:35.841 --> 05:37.411
likes you could get on footage like this?

05:37.545 --> 05:38.979
Hear that, James?

05:39.111 --> 05:41.114
My girl thinks we're heroes.

05:44.118 --> 05:45.786
Baghdraneva...

05:45.920 --> 05:48.322
I love the way it rolls off the tongue.

05:48.454 --> 05:49.957
Just please don't call him that.

05:50.089 --> 05:52.258
Those beads don't make him Hindu.

05:52.392 --> 05:53.693
They just make him more likely

05:53.827 --> 05:55.262
to make out with men at raves.

05:55.394 --> 05:58.498
Hey, hey, keep your
panties on, both of you.

05:58.632 --> 05:59.833
Who's wearing panties?

05:59.966 --> 06:00.635
I am.

06:10.611 --> 06:12.445
Lost in your phone again.

06:12.579 --> 06:13.947
I'm just checking some work emails.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.648
Babe, you work at a
drive-through espresso stand

06:15.783 --> 06:17.050
in your bikini all day.

06:17.183 --> 06:19.085
How many important work emails do you get?

06:19.219 --> 06:21.488
I'm the manager, Baby. Tons.

06:21.622 --> 06:22.823
Come on, baby, seriously.

06:22.957 --> 06:24.158
Put the phone away.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.159
I'm just checking some things.

06:26.293 --> 06:28.262
Oh, babe, come on.

06:28.396 --> 06:30.198
Not the Twilight tours again.

06:31.632 --> 06:33.300
Tim thinks that I look just like

06:33.433 --> 06:35.001
the chick from the movie.

06:35.135 --> 06:37.070
I'm not doing a Twilight tour.

06:38.904 --> 06:40.406
You know, actually, did
anybody ever tell you

06:40.541 --> 06:42.142
that you look kind of like that Jacob...

06:42.274 --> 06:45.078
Oh, yes, I was just thinking that, yes!

06:45.212 --> 06:46.046
Totally.

06:46.178 --> 06:47.914
The native werewolf guy.

06:48.048 --> 06:49.382
It's because of the jaw line.

06:49.517 --> 06:50.951
The jaw, the nose too though.

06:51.084 --> 06:52.319
Enough.

06:52.452 --> 06:54.354
I go away for a couple
tours and I come back,

06:54.488 --> 06:56.423
and not only did he change his name

06:56.557 --> 06:58.225
to Moon Nectar of the fucking gods,

06:58.358 --> 06:59.993
or whatever the shit he calls himself.

07:00.127 --> 07:02.230
Now you got him watching
tween flicks as well?

07:03.731 --> 07:05.065
What happened to you, man?

07:05.199 --> 07:07.201
It's called an awakening, Jimbo.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.969
The whole planet's waking up.

07:10.103 --> 07:11.271
Yeah? Waking up to what?

07:11.404 --> 07:12.672
A fucking dick in their mouth?

07:12.805 --> 07:14.173
Courtesy of the power-elite?

07:14.308 --> 07:15.843
Jesus fucking Christ!

07:15.976 --> 07:18.779
Man, the shit you say is just wrong.

07:18.911 --> 07:21.649
However, there is one stop
that we do need to make.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.383
Another pit stop?

07:23.517 --> 07:25.418
Dude, this is horse's shit, man.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.620
It's gonna be too damned late to even surf,

07:27.755 --> 07:30.156
by the time we get to La Push.

07:30.289 --> 07:32.358
Whatever. Can we get some Cheetos?

07:32.491 --> 07:34.560
You used to be fat.
You remember that right?

07:34.695 --> 07:36.863
You guys are faggots. Shut the fuck up.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.522
So, this is where your meth guy lives?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.792
No, brother, it's not meth we're here for.

08:04.925 --> 08:07.061
Believe it or not, in
that white-trash Mecca,

08:07.194 --> 08:09.529
is the key to the sweet-leaf holy grail.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.398
God, you're so random.

08:11.531 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, and speaking of random,

08:13.132 --> 08:15.935
you know that I get surprise
UA's pretty much all the time.

08:16.069 --> 08:18.639
No way I'm smoking up
with you fucking assholes.

08:18.772 --> 08:22.175
Dude, this ganja is some next level shit.

08:22.308 --> 08:23.810
It's not worth the risk, okay?

08:23.944 --> 08:25.612
You're out of the Corps
now, it's different for you.

08:25.745 --> 08:29.350
Those pills you're
taking, are not the answer.

08:29.483 --> 08:31.485
Cannabis has medicinal properties, alright?

08:31.618 --> 08:33.620
It's not just some
recreational time-waster.

08:33.753 --> 08:34.988
Science has my back on this.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.457
Yeah, science, bitch.

08:36.589 --> 08:40.193
Look, this is a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

08:40.326 --> 08:42.128
You go in there, you
get a map that leads you

08:42.261 --> 08:44.131
to a secret grove in the mountains.

08:44.265 --> 08:47.033
It'll be a badass
mission, just like before!

08:47.166 --> 08:48.802
I'm not going in.

08:48.935 --> 08:51.939
Dude, this ganja is out of this world.

08:53.373 --> 08:56.709
It is not of this earth! Comprende?

08:56.843 --> 08:58.411
Dude, hand me the box, let's go.

09:02.215 --> 09:03.416
Thank you.

09:05.252 --> 09:06.320
Oh, my god.

09:27.873 --> 09:29.375
Sweet-leaf holy grail, huh?

09:29.509 --> 09:31.645
Yeah, told you, come on.

10:14.653 --> 10:17.023
Yeah, this is the right place.

10:17.891 --> 10:19.825
Namaste.

10:19.959 --> 10:24.098
I'm looking for Seth
Guardrail Slaughter, is he in?

10:24.230 --> 10:27.000
- Seth Guardrail Slaughter?
- He's a biker.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.235
Dude, what the fuck.

11:02.368 --> 11:05.638
Young man, want a little advice?

11:05.772 --> 11:06.772
No, man, fuck you.

11:06.906 --> 11:08.007
Jesus...

11:17.651 --> 11:19.585
What's happening.

11:19.719 --> 11:21.387
You must be here about the star leaf.

11:22.321 --> 11:23.523
Well, come on up.

11:23.656 --> 11:25.959
Always happy to have some close encounters.

11:35.969 --> 11:37.537
Glad you could make it.

11:39.272 --> 11:40.541
Meet my girls.

11:40.674 --> 11:43.009
Aren't they beauties?

11:43.142 --> 11:45.377
Speaking of beauty, what in the world

11:45.512 --> 11:47.580
do they put in the
water, where you're from?

11:51.984 --> 11:53.486
What's up man.

11:55.254 --> 11:56.955
Alright, hey, have a seat here.

11:57.089 --> 11:58.291
These pillows ain't just for show.

11:58.425 --> 11:59.593
Take a load off.

12:00.661 --> 12:01.896
My queen.

12:05.831 --> 12:07.367
Well, what can I do for you?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.269
Well, we came here for the star leaf map.

12:10.402 --> 12:12.071
Of course you did.

12:13.473 --> 12:15.008
Oh, right, right, of course.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.244
My bad.

12:19.112 --> 12:23.317
Total human optimization, gotta love that.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.151
And that's the point, really, isn't it?

12:25.285 --> 12:26.920
Coming back, time and time again,

12:27.052 --> 12:29.888
this reality, that reality,

12:30.022 --> 12:33.859
perfecting ourselves, slowly
over the course of infinity.

12:33.993 --> 12:37.998
It's like, somewhere out
there, is a giant disco-ball,

12:38.132 --> 12:40.800
casting countless reflections.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.969
And each one of us,

12:43.103 --> 12:46.406
is a tiny piece of that infinite light.

12:48.273 --> 12:49.642
Dude, shut up.

12:51.243 --> 12:52.912
Oh, sorry.

12:53.046 --> 12:56.215
Yeah, the brain isn't what
it used to be, since the fall.

12:56.349 --> 12:57.816
That's why I need these babies.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.418
You fell and hurt your head?

12:59.551 --> 13:03.022
Well, cosmologically speaking, yes.

13:03.156 --> 13:06.126
But not all those that fall, are fallen.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.871
What? Did I forget something?

13:18.238 --> 13:20.205
The gummy snacks.

13:20.339 --> 13:21.740
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

13:21.874 --> 13:23.308
I forgot the gummy snacks.

13:23.443 --> 13:25.279
See, this is what happens
when you don't write shit down.

13:26.412 --> 13:27.714
The Queen loves the gummy snacks.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.517
That's your favorite. Right, Darling?

13:30.651 --> 13:32.752
You like that watermelon flavor, don't you?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.321
We'll get it next time.

13:35.454 --> 13:36.290
Does that mean that we...

13:36.422 --> 13:37.825
No worries. No worries.

13:37.958 --> 13:40.060
Now, I assume whoever told
you about the star leaf,

13:40.193 --> 13:42.195
clued you into the code of conduct?

13:42.329 --> 13:43.497
Yes...

13:43.629 --> 13:47.299
No photos. No video. No GPS.

13:47.432 --> 13:50.269
You can't take any seeds
or clippings from the site,

13:50.403 --> 13:51.437
although you can smoke as much

13:51.570 --> 13:52.571
as you want, while you're there.

13:52.705 --> 13:53.973
And you gotta destroy the map.

13:54.107 --> 13:55.709
Yeah, and you cannot leave a trace.

13:55.842 --> 13:56.877
Right, right.

13:57.011 --> 13:57.945
- Capisce?
- Affirmative.

13:59.211 --> 14:00.179
I've seen that before.

14:03.382 --> 14:04.817
You can read that?

14:06.653 --> 14:09.355
No, but I saw it when I
was high up in the Kush.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.627
I didn't take you for an O.G. Kush fan.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.296
I'm talking about the Hindu Kush.

14:16.429 --> 14:18.832
The mountain range where we
were fighting for our country.

14:18.964 --> 14:20.834
Not sitting on a fucking puff-pad,

14:20.967 --> 14:22.602
getting stoned all fucking day.

14:22.735 --> 14:24.704
Okay, okay, you're gonna
have to excuse my friend.

14:24.838 --> 14:27.406
He's still decompressing
from his last tour,

14:27.541 --> 14:29.075
and he'll need some time.

14:29.209 --> 14:30.243
It took me a while too.

14:30.377 --> 14:31.544
Come on, man.

14:31.677 --> 14:32.945
Why is it on your wall?

14:33.079 --> 14:34.848
The real question is,

14:34.982 --> 14:37.117
why is it still in your head?

14:38.685 --> 14:39.619
He got you.

14:40.652 --> 14:41.620
Fuck you guys.

14:43.489 --> 14:46.625
All right, who's ready to get weird?

14:46.759 --> 14:48.361
The actual star leaf...

14:48.494 --> 14:49.863
Now hold up, Moon-dog.

14:49.996 --> 14:52.132
This is isn't the actual star leaf.

14:52.265 --> 14:54.167
It's just a distant cousin.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.670
Put it in your mouth, baby.

14:56.802 --> 14:58.638
And suck it.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.814
You mean to tell me that this star leaf,

15:07.948 --> 15:10.250
is actually from outer space?

15:10.382 --> 15:12.618
We are outer space.

15:12.752 --> 15:15.522
Macrocosms, microcosms...

15:15.655 --> 15:17.291
Yeah, that. What he said.

15:28.334 --> 15:30.337
The actual star leaf map.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.140
The map's free.

15:35.273 --> 15:37.710
The journey isn't.

15:44.550 --> 15:46.819
Well, I hope you all have a blast.

15:46.953 --> 15:49.189
Right out of this world.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.757
Thank you. Thank you.

15:51.891 --> 15:54.094
Thank you both for your hospitality.

15:55.695 --> 15:56.863
Thanks.

15:59.666 --> 16:02.300
From the halls of Montezuma,

16:02.435 --> 16:05.405
to the shores of Tripoli.

16:05.539 --> 16:08.775
We fight our country's battles

16:08.908 --> 16:11.978
In the air, on land, and sea.

16:12.112 --> 16:15.382
First to fight for right and freedom

16:15.515 --> 16:18.919
And to keep our honor clean.

16:19.051 --> 16:21.887
We are proud to claim the title

16:22.022 --> 16:25.025
of United States Marines.

16:49.483 --> 16:52.919
Whoa! It is sexy as fuck out here.

16:53.052 --> 16:55.620
Yeah. It beats dirty-ass hippy drug dens.

16:55.754 --> 16:56.856
Yeah.

16:56.989 --> 16:59.392
How far away is La Push from here?

16:59.526 --> 17:01.060
Dude, the beach ain't going anywhere.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.630
We've got an adventure in
these woods here, first.

17:05.163 --> 17:08.035
I mean, are you sure we're
even in the right place?

17:08.734 --> 17:09.902
Yeah, dude.

17:10.036 --> 17:11.403
Look at the marking right there.

17:11.536 --> 17:13.574
There's tons of them, all down this road.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.608
Dude, check your bag.

17:15.741 --> 17:17.009
Make sure you've got all your stuff there.

17:17.142 --> 17:18.644
It's a long walk, we
might have to setup camp.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.580
Quick pit stop, my ass, nectar boy.

17:21.713 --> 17:22.781
Wait a second.

17:22.915 --> 17:24.517
Wait, you said we're camping here?

17:24.651 --> 17:26.018
I thought we were camping on the beach.

17:26.151 --> 17:28.454
Babe, we can do all that
Twilight tour stuff later.

17:28.588 --> 17:30.155
Come on, this is really important for me.

17:30.289 --> 17:32.558
No, no, no, no way, now way.

17:32.691 --> 17:35.461
Bella's Sunset tour is
on, bitch. You promised.

17:35.594 --> 17:36.929
He promised.

17:37.063 --> 17:39.632
Hey, you know Edward is like 400 years old,

17:39.766 --> 17:42.002
and still tries to fuck high school kids.

17:42.134 --> 17:44.171
Whatevs.

17:44.304 --> 17:45.671
We're just gonna hump all this gear along,

17:45.805 --> 17:47.740
in case we camp tonight?

17:48.708 --> 17:50.009
Yeah.

17:50.142 --> 17:51.376
Dude, why don't you
just admit it to yourself

17:51.510 --> 17:52.944
that your whole entire
plan for being up here

17:53.078 --> 17:54.580
is to smoke yourself into oblivion.

17:54.713 --> 17:56.815
What are you talking about?

17:56.950 --> 17:59.219
Just drop the fucking act already, man.

17:59.352 --> 18:01.853
No, no, no, I mean, we're
going to find star leaf.

18:01.988 --> 18:03.289
And if we find some,

18:03.422 --> 18:05.291
I just think it'd be prudent
of us to smoke a little.

18:05.424 --> 18:07.192
Dude said no photos.

18:07.325 --> 18:09.095
Why do you care?

18:09.228 --> 18:10.596
Come on, babe.

18:10.729 --> 18:12.332
Your online fan-base has enough

18:12.465 --> 18:14.034
pouty-face selfies for one day.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.669
Put it away, come on.

18:15.802 --> 18:17.236
What about his stupid camera?

18:17.370 --> 18:18.939
This thing's off, okay?

18:19.072 --> 18:20.440
I just didn't wanna leave it in the car.

18:20.573 --> 18:21.874
I didn't feel like it was safe.

18:22.008 --> 18:23.142
Yeah, well, I actually don't safe

18:23.276 --> 18:24.811
leaving my iPhone in the car, so...

18:24.943 --> 18:27.813
Babe, Martha, sweetie, come on.

18:27.948 --> 18:29.416
- Don't give me that shit.
- I just need you,

18:29.548 --> 18:31.550
to play by the rules, this one time.

18:31.683 --> 18:34.787
Promise me you'll turn
it off and keep it off.

18:34.921 --> 18:36.555
Why? You know?

18:36.689 --> 18:37.990
I mean what's the big deal?

18:38.123 --> 18:40.459
The big deal is that the phone's GPS data

18:40.593 --> 18:42.528
will give away the location of the weed.

18:43.697 --> 18:44.998
Fine.

18:45.131 --> 18:46.565
I can't believe they
trust us at all, out here.

18:46.699 --> 18:47.534
I wouldn't.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.436
Come on, let's giddy-up!

18:50.970 --> 18:52.404
Man sure likes his weed.

18:52.537 --> 18:55.208
He likes a lot of things.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.477
And he isn't afraid to
go after them, either.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.535
Hey, here, swing back on me.

19:59.238 --> 20:01.173
Hey, time for chow.

20:01.307 --> 20:02.842
Yes, please, I'm so hungry.

20:02.976 --> 20:04.511
Put something in my mouth.

20:05.577 --> 20:06.612
Anything.

20:06.746 --> 20:07.613
Girl, you crazy.

20:08.847 --> 20:09.782
Take a piece.

20:15.822 --> 20:17.757
Oh, fuck. It tastes like shit.

20:17.891 --> 20:19.793
What's in it? Shit?

20:19.926 --> 20:21.127
It's my new edible recipe.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.528
Ganesha's groovy granola.

20:22.662 --> 20:23.896
I mean, it could use some more agave.

20:24.029 --> 20:25.464
But it's pretty good for homemade.

20:25.597 --> 20:26.932
Edible, as in weed edible?

20:27.066 --> 20:28.500
Yeah.

20:28.634 --> 20:30.402
What the fuck is your problem, man?

20:30.536 --> 20:32.772
Two problems. Hungry and sober.

20:32.904 --> 20:34.373
Eat some granola, bam!

20:34.507 --> 20:37.677
Two birds, one stoner.

20:37.809 --> 20:40.113
What? Oh, whoa my dude's crafty.

20:40.247 --> 20:41.180
- Give it up
- Yep.

20:41.314 --> 20:42.248
You got it, baby.

20:46.219 --> 20:47.553
What the F?

20:47.687 --> 20:48.889
Whoa.

20:54.794 --> 20:56.963
Those branches look like alien fingers.

20:57.095 --> 20:58.998
Just some random branch configuration.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.299
Nothing to bust a nut on.

21:00.432 --> 21:01.600
Yeah? Then why is it pointing

21:01.734 --> 21:03.236
in the exact direction of the star leaf?

21:03.369 --> 21:05.372
Just a random coincidence.

21:05.505 --> 21:07.172
James doesn't believe in aliens.

21:07.306 --> 21:08.708
Where's the proof?

21:08.842 --> 21:10.009
Ahh...

21:10.142 --> 21:11.444
Exactly.

21:12.245 --> 21:13.546
Come on, man.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.215
Don't tell me you never
even entertained the idea.

21:15.347 --> 21:18.750
Some people say they are the jinn of Islam.

21:18.884 --> 21:21.087
Wait, what are the jinn?

21:22.322 --> 21:23.390
Demons.

21:54.921 --> 21:56.623
Tim?

21:56.756 --> 21:59.559
I have never seen trees like this before.

22:06.900 --> 22:07.968
Is this on the map?

22:08.101 --> 22:09.469
I mean, I think so.

22:09.602 --> 22:12.372
I think it's these outlines, right here.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.507
I had no idea what those
meant until right now.

22:14.640 --> 22:15.842
That's weird.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.982
The grove should just be up this way.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.127
Wait, what's with all these bulges?

22:34.259 --> 22:36.161
Tree tumors, maybe?

22:36.295 --> 22:38.296
You never complained
about bulging wood before.

22:38.430 --> 22:40.332
Honey, if your wood was bulging like this,

22:40.466 --> 22:41.968
I'd take you to a doctor.

22:46.271 --> 22:47.540
Dude, what if these are all filled with

22:47.673 --> 22:49.975
the sweetest fucking resin you ever had?

22:50.109 --> 22:51.511
We should tap these babies and get some

22:51.643 --> 22:53.445
sweet-ass, star leaf syrup.

22:53.578 --> 22:54.913
Woo!

22:55.047 --> 22:57.316
Sip, sippin' on some sizzurp.

22:57.450 --> 22:58.617
Help me up.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.555
Sippin' on some sizzurp.
Sippin' on some sizzurp.

23:03.023 --> 23:05.158
These branches look sharp enough to kill.

23:05.292 --> 23:08.094
Yeah, I guess mother nature
don't take no prisoners, huh?

23:08.227 --> 23:09.396
I mean, either that or she wanted

23:09.528 --> 23:12.198
to keep this place a secret for a reason.

23:12.331 --> 23:13.632
Ugh! Ugh!

23:13.766 --> 23:16.069
Babe, that's not actually star leaf syrup.

23:16.201 --> 23:17.938
Well, it's still gross.

23:44.096 --> 23:45.798
- James!
- James!

23:48.000 --> 23:49.435
James!

23:57.543 --> 23:59.245
Oh, my god!

23:59.378 --> 24:02.716
Welcome to the garden
of Weeden, motherfucker!

24:02.848 --> 24:07.185
- Ta da!
- We found it! I told you!

24:07.319 --> 24:10.556
I think I've seen bigger
plants than this in Afghanistan.

24:10.690 --> 24:12.725
Dude, you see all these other plants?

24:12.859 --> 24:15.228
Fuck them. It's about this one, right here.

24:15.361 --> 24:16.929
This is the queen bee,

24:17.062 --> 24:20.833
the mother of all marijuana
plants on planet Earth.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.669
They say she was seeded from outer space,

24:22.802 --> 24:25.171
and sent to us by some
extraterrestrial intelligence,

24:25.305 --> 24:27.105
to help us find our way back.

24:27.238 --> 24:29.174
Wow, man. Back from what?

24:30.642 --> 24:32.812
Well, fuck if I know! I
just came to smoke this shit!

24:32.944 --> 24:34.748
Oh, my god!

24:37.016 --> 24:39.985
Whoa, brother. Jesus, chill out, man.

24:40.119 --> 24:41.454
What?

24:41.586 --> 24:43.256
You're being an asshole
to that plant right now.

24:44.723 --> 24:46.091
You know what? You're right.

24:46.226 --> 24:48.127
- Chill.
- Alright.

24:48.260 --> 24:51.396
You're right. I'm being kind
of an asshole to this plant.

24:51.530 --> 24:53.264
I need to step aside for a minute,

24:53.399 --> 24:55.834
center myself, come back,

24:55.969 --> 25:00.273
snip some buds, and proceed
to get fucking baked.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.709
Awesome.

25:03.843 --> 25:05.545
You don't think he's addicted, do you?

25:05.678 --> 25:06.746
Him?

25:08.146 --> 25:10.282
No, he's always been like that.

25:10.417 --> 25:14.788
First guy in high school to
tap a keg, unsnap a bra...

25:16.788 --> 25:18.458
Dude's a legend.

25:19.525 --> 25:20.893
Well, speaking of legends,

25:21.026 --> 25:22.694
I've heard a lot about you, James.

25:22.827 --> 25:24.129
Yeah?

25:24.263 --> 25:25.898
Yeah, I wasn't sure if
we'd hit it off at first.

25:26.032 --> 25:28.301
But you know, so far so good.

25:31.304 --> 25:35.374
Look, Tim's my bro.

25:35.507 --> 25:36.741
Yeah.

25:36.875 --> 25:40.613
I just wanted to thank
you for your services.

25:41.948 --> 25:42.815
Okay.

26:20.352 --> 26:21.488
Tim?

26:29.327 --> 26:31.062
Alright, this is ready.

26:31.197 --> 26:33.332
Who's ready to blast off?

26:33.466 --> 26:34.867
Oh, me, me, me.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.336
Oh, you know, before we
commence this ceremony,

26:37.469 --> 26:38.836
we should say like a
little prayer, you know?

26:38.970 --> 26:39.838
Kind of get into it.

26:39.972 --> 26:41.206
Out loud, or what?

26:41.340 --> 26:42.676
Whatever you feel comfortable with.

26:47.046 --> 26:48.213
Roll, roll, roll the joint.

26:48.346 --> 26:51.016
Twist it at the ends.

26:51.150 --> 26:53.686
Take a puff and that's enough,

26:53.818 --> 26:57.022
now pass it to your friends.

26:59.292 --> 27:01.560
Man, what kind of eastern
bullshit you been studying?

27:01.693 --> 27:03.495
Well, have you ever heard of Tantra?

27:05.197 --> 27:06.866
No.

27:06.998 --> 27:08.735
Cause he has, and it's divine.

27:08.867 --> 27:11.636
It's an ancient Vedic
sexual ecstasy practice.

27:11.769 --> 27:12.805
No big deal.

27:12.939 --> 27:14.006
No big deal?

27:14.140 --> 27:15.641
I'd say marathon love-making sessions,

27:15.775 --> 27:17.442
ending in multiple female ejaculation,

27:17.576 --> 27:19.844
is kind of a big deal.

27:19.978 --> 27:22.114
Jesus, fuck, calm down.

27:30.221 --> 27:31.557
That's it.

27:33.057 --> 27:34.861
I can't.

27:34.994 --> 27:37.297
Dude, this leaves no trace in your system.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.502
Okay.

28:04.856 --> 28:06.258
Oh, my god.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.248
Guys, I can't move.

28:30.516 --> 28:32.885
I can't move, guys.

28:33.018 --> 28:33.920
Did I ever tell you that I used to be

28:34.053 --> 28:35.854
Jim Morrison in a past life?

28:49.035 --> 28:50.637
I'm so hot.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.305
I make fire jealous.

28:54.506 --> 28:55.374
Right?

28:58.209 --> 28:59.245
Baby, look at me.

28:59.379 --> 29:00.947
I haven't danced like this since 69.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.415
You look like you're
having a fucking seizure.

29:03.548 --> 29:04.950
You're not Jim Morrison.

29:14.927 --> 29:16.763
Tim, you're gonna fall in the fire.

29:18.064 --> 29:19.098
What'd you say?

29:19.230 --> 29:20.933
You want me to light your fire?

29:29.174 --> 29:30.776
Do you think I'm pretty?

29:35.748 --> 29:36.915
Yo...

29:38.551 --> 29:40.086
Your...

29:47.326 --> 29:51.796
That is the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

29:51.930 --> 29:54.233
Tim's too busy jerking
off, to Asian fairy porn,

29:54.365 --> 29:56.235
to notice me anymore.

29:57.569 --> 29:58.937
Do you like Asian fairy porn?

30:08.180 --> 30:09.449
Of course you do.

30:18.289 --> 30:19.491
All men do.

30:38.376 --> 30:39.578
Tim...

30:40.712 --> 30:42.414
Tim, you're gonna fall in the fire.

30:51.556 --> 30:54.661
What in the fuck just happened?

30:54.794 --> 30:55.928
Threw some sticks on the fire, homie.

30:56.061 --> 30:57.330
You feeling it?

30:59.797 --> 31:00.666
What?

31:01.566 --> 31:03.201
Here, hit this.

31:03.334 --> 31:04.870
No, fuck no.

31:05.004 --> 31:06.439
All right, suit yourself.

31:09.342 --> 31:12.978
Did you guys kill anyone
when you were in Afghanistan?

31:13.112 --> 31:15.014
Why you gotta go bringing
everyone down like that?

31:15.146 --> 31:16.480
You're on a crazy train right now,

31:16.614 --> 31:17.450
and it's time to get off.

31:17.583 --> 31:18.650
I'm sorry.

31:18.784 --> 31:19.584
I know you're high right now,

31:19.718 --> 31:20.620
but you need to stop.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.588
I'm sorry, war makes me laugh.

31:22.721 --> 31:26.526
Maybe this is enough for one night.

31:28.727 --> 31:30.696
Did you see that?

31:30.830 --> 31:31.797
The shooting star?

31:31.930 --> 31:33.032
Yeah.

31:35.968 --> 31:37.569
Whoa! What the hell?

31:37.702 --> 31:38.269
Jesus.

31:38.402 --> 31:40.639
Oh, dude!

31:40.771 --> 31:42.374
They don't call this star leaf for nothing.

31:42.507 --> 31:44.876
Full-on visuals!

31:45.009 --> 31:47.378
Wait, where do stars come from, anyway?

31:47.513 --> 31:48.647
Same place we do.

31:48.780 --> 31:50.415
Everything's star dust, baby.

31:54.286 --> 31:55.921
Fuck. Do you hear that?

31:59.525 --> 32:01.127
This weed is getting trippy.

32:01.259 --> 32:02.460
Maybe we should all just get up,

32:02.594 --> 32:04.028
and like walk around.

32:04.162 --> 32:05.930
No, dude. I fucking
heard something out there.

32:06.064 --> 32:07.200
Really?

32:10.268 --> 32:11.170
Shit, there's movement out there!

32:11.303 --> 32:13.406
Dude, sit down.

32:13.538 --> 32:15.173
It's just voices in your head, alright?

32:15.306 --> 32:16.508
I'm fucking telling you, man.

32:16.642 --> 32:18.643
I heard somebody talking
out there, in Pashto.

32:18.777 --> 32:19.812
What the hell is Pashto?

32:19.944 --> 32:21.146
It's an Afghan dialect.

32:21.279 --> 32:22.480
It's just voices in your head, alright?

32:22.613 --> 32:23.815
They get louder when there's no

32:23.950 --> 32:25.217
city noise to drown them out.

32:25.351 --> 32:26.118
He's right.

32:27.952 --> 32:29.187
What the hell?

32:30.622 --> 32:32.925
City noise does tend to drown out a lot.

32:33.057 --> 32:34.227
Doesn't it?

32:37.863 --> 32:39.832
Unfortunately, city people,

32:39.965 --> 32:41.734
such as yourselves, make so much noise,

32:41.866 --> 32:44.435
you can hear them miles
away, in the dead of night.

32:44.569 --> 32:47.539
Talking about the secrets of the universe,

32:47.672 --> 32:49.342
and all kinds of interesting stuff,

32:49.475 --> 32:53.346
people like to talk
about when they're high.

32:54.380 --> 32:55.547
Hmm?

32:56.648 --> 32:59.519
Oh, look at that.

33:10.296 --> 33:11.497
Mmm.

33:16.434 --> 33:17.869
It is legal now.

33:18.703 --> 33:19.971
No prescription necessary.

33:21.573 --> 33:24.043
I'm sorry, old habits die hard.

33:25.477 --> 33:26.945
Officer?

33:27.078 --> 33:28.746
Forrest ranger.

33:28.881 --> 33:32.718
I'm just out making my rounds.

33:32.851 --> 33:36.122
Walking the trails with
the snakes and the snails.

33:36.255 --> 33:39.592
Checking the pines for
those evergreen crimes.

33:40.325 --> 33:42.094
Hmm?

33:42.228 --> 33:43.629
We found some evergreen, alright.

33:46.265 --> 33:47.833
That you did, honey.

33:47.967 --> 33:49.569
That you did.

33:50.936 --> 33:52.605
Here you go.

33:52.738 --> 33:54.707
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:54.840 --> 33:58.276
You folks mind if I take a knee?

33:58.410 --> 33:59.644
Please.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.183
Have a seat, son.

34:05.417 --> 34:06.651
Fire's getting cold.

34:08.721 --> 34:10.422
Well, look at that.

34:10.554 --> 34:12.389
Marshmallows and everything.

34:14.058 --> 34:18.964
Wow, you kids sure know how
to enjoy the great outdoors.

34:19.831 --> 34:21.366
I'll give you that.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.668
So, is this place something that

34:22.801 --> 34:26.138
you and the other forest
rangers know about?

34:26.272 --> 34:28.674
We've been coming here a long time, son.

34:28.806 --> 34:31.710
Oh, you mean like the
indigenous first peoples?

34:32.678 --> 34:34.080
I'm talking about everyone.

34:35.147 --> 34:36.282
From everywhere.

34:48.092 --> 34:50.696
Do you see a lot of wildlife?

34:54.966 --> 34:56.701
I saw a moose fucking a bear once.

34:58.004 --> 35:00.404
Wait, you saw what?

35:00.538 --> 35:03.142
Moose, fucking a bear.

35:04.442 --> 35:05.945
No, man.

35:08.080 --> 35:08.947
What, are you telling me you've never

35:09.080 --> 35:10.948
seen something strange before?

35:12.984 --> 35:15.621
Something only you, and
no one else could see?

35:16.488 --> 35:17.390
Hmm?

35:19.491 --> 35:21.326
You folks wanna get high?

35:21.460 --> 35:22.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:22.995 --> 35:27.065
Well, you can certainly get high, right?

35:51.056 --> 35:52.558
Whoa.

35:52.690 --> 35:54.227
It's not how high you go that matters.

35:55.259 --> 35:57.062
It's where you go.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.964
Ah, I like the way you think, officer.

35:59.096 --> 36:00.232
- Ranger.
- Ranger...

36:00.364 --> 36:01.033
Ranger.

36:01.165 --> 36:01.866
Ranger.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.069
Ranger Dave.

36:04.169 --> 36:05.071
All right, well...

36:06.171 --> 36:08.040
You folks have a good night.

36:08.174 --> 36:11.009
And enjoy the great outdoors.

36:17.149 --> 36:19.518
What the fuck was that?

36:19.652 --> 36:21.453
Did that really just happen?

36:21.587 --> 36:24.323
I have no idea what the
dude was talking about.

36:24.457 --> 36:25.591
Do you think he was

36:25.725 --> 36:27.460
lying about a moose fucking a bear?

36:27.593 --> 36:29.428
I don't know, with the
weed we've been smoking,

36:29.560 --> 36:31.328
I'd kinda believe him.

36:31.462 --> 36:32.797
Oh, man.

36:32.931 --> 36:35.767
Man, I don't even think
he was real, though.

36:35.901 --> 36:37.536
Yeah, man, he was real.

36:39.738 --> 36:42.207
Okay, I'm going to bed.

36:42.341 --> 36:43.842
You know what? I'm gonna follow you.

36:43.975 --> 36:46.411
I don't want any close
encounters of the moose-rape kind.

36:46.544 --> 36:48.379
Ooh, I actually wouldn't mind seeing that.

36:48.513 --> 36:49.714
Well, get in that tent,

36:49.848 --> 36:51.217
and I'll show you what
a moose dick looks like.

36:53.718 --> 36:54.585
Let me in first.

36:54.719 --> 36:56.087
No!

38:17.703 --> 38:20.038
They'll be coming for you, James.

38:21.372 --> 38:23.475
They've have their eye on you a long time.

38:24.776 --> 38:26.145
Long time...

38:27.645 --> 38:29.080
But you already knew that.

38:31.382 --> 38:33.785
Didn't you? Hmm?

38:57.375 --> 38:58.977
Careful where you're going, now.

38:59.111 --> 39:00.745
You never know what you might find.

39:00.879 --> 39:02.114
Who the fuck are you?

39:02.247 --> 39:04.315
Stay the fuck away from my friends!

39:18.564 --> 39:20.533
Get up, goddamn it! We've got hostiles!

39:24.703 --> 39:25.603
Shit.

39:26.370 --> 39:27.539
James!

39:37.948 --> 39:38.850
Martha?

39:40.317 --> 39:42.153
What are you doing out here?

39:42.288 --> 39:44.490
Waiting for you to find me.

39:44.622 --> 39:47.892
We have to go back to the camp.

39:48.026 --> 39:49.560
Where's Tim?

39:49.694 --> 39:51.396
The plant can help you, James.

39:51.529 --> 39:52.830
What?

39:52.964 --> 39:54.333
It's a portal, don't you see?

39:55.267 --> 39:56.435
To the stars.

39:58.036 --> 39:59.404
What are you talking about?

40:00.906 --> 40:02.208
Where are your clothes?

40:04.509 --> 40:06.011
These can't help you.

40:08.279 --> 40:10.548
Share your pain with me, James.

40:12.917 --> 40:13.951
No, I don't need saving.

40:14.085 --> 40:15.120
Come here.

40:37.207 --> 40:37.910
Fuck!

41:12.410 --> 41:13.279
Tim?

41:14.413 --> 41:15.781
Tim?

41:19.984 --> 41:23.087
What? How the hell did we get out here?

41:24.388 --> 41:26.490
I don't know.

41:26.625 --> 41:27.660
We must've been higher than we thought.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.828
Yeah.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.100
Where's James?

41:37.002 --> 41:39.772
Probably smart enough to
sleep in his own tent. I guess.

41:42.207 --> 41:44.609
Well, we better check.

41:48.614 --> 41:50.015
Wait a sec.

41:55.085 --> 41:58.689
Ooh, now this is the
bulging wood I came to see.

41:58.823 --> 42:01.125
Top of the morning to you, too.

42:01.259 --> 42:03.429
Morning glory, or whatever it is.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.408
Tim? Martha?

42:36.395 --> 42:37.862
- Shit!
- What?

42:37.995 --> 42:39.096
Get down. Get down.

42:39.230 --> 42:40.299
What the hell is going on?

42:40.431 --> 42:41.700
What are you guys doing out here?

42:41.832 --> 42:42.533
There's something behind that tree.

42:42.667 --> 42:43.701
It was watching us.

42:43.835 --> 42:45.304
What the fuck you talking about?

42:45.437 --> 42:46.603
The fucking tree, right
there, was watching us.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.006
Please go check it out.

42:49.741 --> 42:50.542
No, to your left!

42:50.674 --> 42:51.408
Here?

42:51.542 --> 42:52.443
The big one!

42:56.381 --> 42:57.482
Do you see anything?

42:58.884 --> 43:00.352
Nothing!

43:00.486 --> 43:01.620
Maybe it was just that moose fucking.

43:01.754 --> 43:03.755
It wasn't a fucking moose.

43:03.888 --> 43:05.923
It wasn't a fucking moose.

43:07.357 --> 43:08.626
Fuck this, man.

43:08.761 --> 43:11.697
Okay, give me my shirt, I'm leaving.

43:43.828 --> 43:45.330
Hurry up! We gotta go!

43:45.462 --> 43:46.330
What, did you see something?

43:46.464 --> 43:47.265
I said we gotta go!

43:47.399 --> 43:48.767
Leave the fucking tents!

43:49.901 --> 43:51.036
I said leave them, come on!

43:51.169 --> 43:52.603
- Coming.
- All right!

44:21.366 --> 44:23.936
I don't know. We're
probably all just still high.

44:24.069 --> 44:25.170
No, I know what I saw.

44:25.303 --> 44:26.738
You saw the lights last night too?

44:26.870 --> 44:27.738
- No.
- Yeah, dude.

44:27.872 --> 44:29.006
We all saw the shooting star.

44:29.140 --> 44:30.675
I'm not talking about the shooting star.

44:30.808 --> 44:32.009
What the hell are you talking about then?

44:32.143 --> 44:33.345
That blinding light that...

44:33.477 --> 44:35.346
Fuck! Whoa! What the fuck is that?

44:35.480 --> 44:36.615
- Jesus!
- Just go man!

44:36.748 --> 44:37.882
- Go!
- Just go!

44:38.982 --> 44:41.051
Holy fucking shit!

44:41.185 --> 44:42.721
What the fuck is that, man?

44:44.756 --> 44:45.790
Calm down.

44:45.924 --> 44:48.393
Get off! Run her over!

44:48.527 --> 44:49.461
Honk the horn!

44:50.863 --> 44:52.330
It's some kind of animal or something!

44:52.462 --> 44:53.131
- Go, motherfucker go!
- Just run it over!

44:53.263 --> 44:53.964
Just go!

45:00.872 --> 45:01.772
Just go around.

45:01.906 --> 45:03.007
Babe, we're in a Prius.

45:03.140 --> 45:04.475
It's not built for off-road activity.

45:07.846 --> 45:09.080
What are you doing?

45:09.214 --> 45:10.949
We must've missed an
off-road or something.

45:12.283 --> 45:13.484
- Shit!
- Holy shit.

45:16.486 --> 45:17.788
It's an ambush.

45:17.922 --> 45:19.357
What the fuck are you
talking about, an ambush?

45:19.491 --> 45:20.592
We're in a kill-zone.

45:20.725 --> 45:21.491
A what zone?

45:21.625 --> 45:22.761
A kill-zone!

45:27.966 --> 45:29.668
Grab your packs, hurry!

45:32.370 --> 45:33.671
Fuck.

45:33.805 --> 45:34.839
- Shit...
- Come on, let's go!

45:34.971 --> 45:36.575
Come on! Come on!

45:38.109 --> 45:39.276
What the hell is going on?

45:39.410 --> 45:40.578
Some kind of ambush.

45:40.712 --> 45:41.913
Who would be ambushing us?

45:42.046 --> 45:43.214
Just get your shit.

45:43.348 --> 45:45.049
What the fuck is the holdup, man?

45:45.183 --> 45:46.351
Come on!

45:47.352 --> 45:48.987
What the hell is that?

45:49.120 --> 45:50.489
Grab that shit and let's go!

45:50.622 --> 45:51.855
What the hell is that?

45:51.989 --> 45:53.024
Is that fucking star leaf?

45:53.158 --> 45:54.359
You have fucking star leaf clippings?

45:54.493 --> 45:56.060
He fucking has star leaf clippings.

45:56.194 --> 45:58.029
You're fucking us over, you realize that?

45:58.163 --> 45:59.364
You guys. You guys.

45:59.497 --> 46:00.297
- Are you serious?
- He fucked us over.

46:00.431 --> 46:01.232
Are you serious?

46:01.366 --> 46:02.500
Man, get rid of that shit!

46:02.634 --> 46:03.368
Dude, it's not that much, okay?

46:03.502 --> 46:04.670
I just needed a little,

46:04.803 --> 46:06.170
to make some clones
when I got home, alright?

46:06.303 --> 46:08.439
Look, you guys are
freaking out way too much.

46:08.573 --> 46:09.507
We all just need to calm...

46:09.640 --> 46:10.875
Whoa, dude!

46:11.009 --> 46:11.876
What the fuck?

46:12.009 --> 46:13.377
Tim? Baby? Baby?

46:13.511 --> 46:15.147
What the fuck just grabbed me?

46:16.881 --> 46:18.416
Baby, are you okay?

46:18.549 --> 46:20.651
Look at me. Let me see. Let me see.

46:35.966 --> 46:37.802
Tim? Martha?

46:47.846 --> 46:49.781
Okay...

46:49.913 --> 46:52.618
James Hunter, Sergeant,
United States Marine Corps.

46:53.585 --> 46:55.553
I'm here, in Washington state,

46:55.687 --> 46:58.123
in the Olympic National Rainforest.

46:58.256 --> 46:59.656
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

46:59.790 --> 47:01.993
But something really, fucked
up is happening right now.

47:02.127 --> 47:04.029
And to be honest, I have no idea what.

47:06.397 --> 47:07.431
Fuck.

47:07.564 --> 47:08.767
I know this looks cheesy as hell,

47:08.899 --> 47:10.167
staring down into a camera,

47:10.301 --> 47:12.337
like some bullshit scene
from some horror film.

47:12.471 --> 47:14.907
But I promise you, this is real, okay?

47:16.741 --> 47:17.976
In case something happens,

47:19.210 --> 47:20.645
hopefully somebody will find this footage,

47:20.777 --> 47:22.647
and try to make some sense out of all this.

47:28.051 --> 47:29.320
It's been an hour.

47:30.855 --> 47:32.557
Still no sign of my friends.

47:34.259 --> 47:36.061
Think I'm gonna head west,

47:36.194 --> 47:39.264
towards the Pacific
ocean, away from the peaks.

47:39.397 --> 47:40.699
Hopefully I'll run into some kind of

47:40.832 --> 47:42.267
fucking civilization out there.

47:42.399 --> 47:44.801
I just have no idea what
the hell I'm doing, still.

47:44.935 --> 47:46.971
But, I don't know, I'm...

48:21.172 --> 48:21.974
Fuck.

49:07.752 --> 49:09.121
Lower your weapon.

49:10.488 --> 49:11.723
Lower your weapon.

49:17.127 --> 49:18.462
Now this, my friend...

49:19.864 --> 49:21.499
This is one hell of a violation,

49:21.632 --> 49:23.335
of park regulations.

49:25.335 --> 49:28.105
Look, I can put in a good word,

49:28.239 --> 49:29.908
about you using this thing here,

49:30.040 --> 49:31.876
considering your current
state of mind and all.

49:32.910 --> 49:35.078
But as for them...

49:35.212 --> 49:37.515
They chose to break the
rules, of their own free will.

49:37.649 --> 49:38.783
My friends are dead and you're

49:38.917 --> 49:40.884
talking to me about the fucking rules?

49:41.018 --> 49:43.321
I'll show you some fucking rules!

49:46.623 --> 49:48.091
If you can't follow a few simple rules,

49:48.225 --> 49:50.027
like not taking photos...

49:50.995 --> 49:52.197
Or as in his case,

49:52.330 --> 49:53.799
stealing himself some
souvenirs to take home.

49:53.931 --> 49:55.466
How are we supposed to trust all of you,

49:55.600 --> 49:57.035
with the secrets to the universe, huh?

49:57.167 --> 49:59.136
You tell me that.

49:59.270 --> 50:00.305
I can't believe I killed them.

50:00.437 --> 50:02.706
Well, let's go check, make sure.

50:10.348 --> 50:12.750
Yeah, they're dead.

50:14.919 --> 50:16.221
You got a permit for this?

50:18.522 --> 50:19.457
I found it.

50:19.589 --> 50:21.558
Wow.

50:21.692 --> 50:23.762
I guess it's your lucky day then.

50:24.928 --> 50:26.564
You sure as hell know how to shoot it.

50:28.065 --> 50:29.334
Don't you?

50:30.433 --> 50:31.335
Yes.

50:32.303 --> 50:33.105
Louder.

50:34.372 --> 50:36.007
Yes, sir.

50:37.140 --> 50:38.876
I can't hear you, maggot!

50:39.009 --> 50:40.078
Sir, yes sir!

50:40.210 --> 50:41.111
Sound off like you've got a pair!

50:41.245 --> 50:42.647
Sir, yes sir!

50:55.292 --> 50:56.693
James?

50:56.828 --> 50:57.996
Oh, my god. We found you.

50:58.129 --> 51:00.531
Who are you yelling at?

51:00.665 --> 51:02.334
What are you doing with that?

51:08.672 --> 51:09.707
I don't believe this.

51:09.841 --> 51:10.842
What?

51:12.143 --> 51:13.177
You're dead.

51:13.310 --> 51:14.844
What are you talking about?

51:14.978 --> 51:17.582
I killed you guys.

51:17.716 --> 51:19.584
Dude, that star leaf really messed with us.

51:19.716 --> 51:22.153
We need to just calm down,
find a place to chill.

51:25.089 --> 51:26.357
I'm sorry.

51:28.692 --> 51:29.526
About what?

51:29.660 --> 51:30.895
What's he talking about, baby?

51:32.297 --> 51:34.632
We didn't know that there would be a kid.

51:36.500 --> 51:39.203
Dude, you're in Washington state now, okay?

51:39.335 --> 51:41.339
You're safe.

51:41.471 --> 51:43.774
You wanted me to take the
shot so bad, didn't you?

51:45.576 --> 51:46.778
The pink mist...

51:47.578 --> 51:48.680
It's yours.

51:49.513 --> 51:50.781
Take the shot.

51:53.651 --> 51:54.819
Take the shot.

51:57.055 --> 51:58.156
Take the shot!

51:58.288 --> 52:00.091
Honey, honey, it's okay.

52:00.223 --> 52:01.926
No! No!

52:02.060 --> 52:03.195
James!

52:11.368 --> 52:13.837
My boy's lost it, completely.

52:13.971 --> 52:15.406
They told you not to touch their stuff.

52:15.538 --> 52:16.607
Why'd you do it?

52:16.741 --> 52:18.009
Had I known it would get this crazy,

52:18.142 --> 52:20.145
I never would've looked
for it in the first place.

52:20.277 --> 52:21.846
Hey, when we get back to the car,

52:21.980 --> 52:24.516
don't let me forget to
pick up the clippings.

52:26.384 --> 52:28.719
So I can take them back to the grove.

52:30.754 --> 52:32.089
Look, you're right. This whole thing is...

52:32.223 --> 52:33.791
No, you know what? This
is fucking bullshit.

52:33.924 --> 52:35.292
Babe, calm down.

52:35.426 --> 52:36.759
You're just having a bad trip.

52:36.893 --> 52:38.462
Take the beads, they'll give you some

52:38.596 --> 52:40.465
- peace and calm.
- No, fuck your hippy beads!

52:40.598 --> 52:42.533
What's your problem?

52:42.667 --> 52:44.669
Look, I'm not the only one
who broke the fucking rules.

52:44.803 --> 52:45.870
No, get off me! Get off me!

52:46.002 --> 52:47.071
- Yeah.
- Give me that.

52:47.205 --> 52:48.439
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh
- No, no, no.

52:48.573 --> 52:50.775
- Give me that!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm the asshole.

52:50.908 --> 52:53.076
I've seen the way you look at James.

52:53.210 --> 52:54.946
I'm not a slut.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.514
Fuck him. Who gives a shit anyway?

52:56.647 --> 52:59.150
What the fuck was he talking
about back there, huh?

52:59.283 --> 53:00.984
The pink mist?

53:01.118 --> 53:04.622
What's the big fucking
secret, huh? Tell me.

53:05.189 --> 53:06.223
Tell me.

53:06.357 --> 53:07.658
What'd you fucking do back there?

53:08.625 --> 53:09.459
What did you do back there?

53:09.593 --> 53:12.096
You fucking killed someone?

53:12.230 --> 53:15.033
You fucking killed someone,
is that what you did?

53:15.165 --> 53:16.801
You're a fucking coward,
hiding behind a plant.

53:16.933 --> 53:18.435
Yeah, who the fuck do you think you are?

53:18.569 --> 53:20.036
Ugh! God!

53:20.171 --> 53:22.073
When we were out, risking
our lives for our country,

53:22.205 --> 53:24.209
you were here fucking every guy in town.

53:26.410 --> 53:28.312
Ah, shit!

53:29.879 --> 53:31.682
We are friends.

53:32.884 --> 53:34.352
We're friends.

53:38.756 --> 53:40.125
Oh, yeah? You like my beads?

53:41.959 --> 53:43.527
Maybe she can help us
find a way out of here.

53:45.663 --> 53:46.965
Hey...

53:47.765 --> 53:49.067
We need some help, yo.

54:17.094 --> 54:17.995
Fuck!

54:18.596 --> 54:19.196
Tim!

54:19.330 --> 54:20.331
Fuck! Oh, god.

54:20.464 --> 54:22.198
Oh, my god. No, no, no.

54:22.332 --> 54:23.434
Tim!

54:27.772 --> 54:29.107
Forget something?

54:29.774 --> 54:30.875
Shit.

54:32.243 --> 54:33.744
You disappoint me, man.

54:33.877 --> 54:35.546
No, no, no. You're not real.

54:35.678 --> 54:37.748
Oh, I'm real.

54:37.881 --> 54:40.249
And it's about to get really real.

54:40.384 --> 54:42.753
No, no. You don't exist.

54:42.886 --> 54:45.189
You're not real. This is my brain on drugs.

54:45.323 --> 54:47.825
Yeah, you're tripping,
man. You're tripping.

54:47.957 --> 54:50.794
And it's a trip straight to hell.

54:50.928 --> 54:52.296
You're just a figment of our imagination,

54:52.428 --> 54:53.897
our collective imagination.

54:54.031 --> 54:54.732
You don't exist.

54:54.866 --> 54:56.201
You disappoint me.

54:56.334 --> 54:57.301
Go away!

54:59.136 --> 55:00.171
Boo.

55:01.872 --> 55:03.140
Boo.

55:11.582 --> 55:13.084
What the fuck?

55:26.129 --> 55:27.864
What is this place?

55:27.997 --> 55:29.166
Where the fuck are we?

55:44.114 --> 55:45.750
Did you write that?

55:57.761 --> 56:00.597
This is my stuff. Where'd
you get this stuff, huh?

56:00.732 --> 56:03.067
This is my fucking sunglasses, my phone...

56:03.200 --> 56:04.701
Where'd you get this?

56:10.473 --> 56:11.975
Oh, my god!

57:04.227 --> 57:05.195
Thank god.

57:07.564 --> 57:08.332
Fuck.

57:12.169 --> 57:13.203
Yes...

58:55.739 --> 58:57.108
What the fuck are you doing here?

58:57.241 --> 58:59.977
Oh, just checking things out.

59:00.111 --> 59:02.647
I hear you got yourself in a bit of a jam.

59:04.181 --> 59:05.583
Nice to see you're working it out.

59:05.716 --> 59:08.618
I'm telling you, my friend
is a fucking idiot, okay?

59:08.752 --> 59:09.887
He didn't mean to take anything...

59:10.020 --> 59:11.821
Oh, he took it. He took it, alright.

59:11.955 --> 59:13.357
And I'm afraid he meant to.

59:13.491 --> 59:14.625
I'm telling you, man.

59:14.759 --> 59:15.626
He didn't mean to do any...

59:15.759 --> 59:17.694
You see this leaf?

59:17.828 --> 59:19.096
Most people think it's only job

59:19.230 --> 59:21.498
is to make them feel good.

59:21.631 --> 59:23.867
But feeling good really
isn't what they want.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.437
What they want, this plant can't give them.

59:27.571 --> 59:28.906
Well, what's that?

59:31.875 --> 59:33.311
What's troubling you, man?

59:34.611 --> 59:36.080
Excuse me?

59:37.381 --> 59:39.783
What happened to you,
over there in Afghanistan?

59:51.761 --> 59:53.830
You saw something else
over there, didn't you?

59:54.931 --> 59:56.901
Same thing you saw at my place.

01:00:03.006 --> 01:00:04.441
Do you know what it means?

01:00:07.643 --> 01:00:09.879
It's a doorway.

01:00:10.013 --> 01:00:12.149
Closed on one side, open on the other.

01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:15.753
But our plant friends, you see...

01:00:18.055 --> 01:00:18.922
They can only show you the door.

01:00:19.056 --> 01:00:20.524
They can't walk you through it.

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:22.926
So what about those things we keep seeing?

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.994
Well, they're no friends of mine.

01:00:24.127 --> 01:00:26.029
I'll tell you that.

01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:28.598
They're more of a nuisance, really.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:30.434
Well, what do they want?

01:00:30.567 --> 01:00:34.137
Man, your karma is like a magnet.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:35.705
They're drawn to it.

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:39.343
Like vultures, in the night, waiting.

01:00:40.343 --> 01:00:41.644
Waiting for what?

01:00:41.777 --> 01:00:43.580
To feed of your conflict.

01:00:43.714 --> 01:00:45.750
They use you to form these

01:00:46.716 --> 01:00:48.785
charged emotional patterns,

01:00:48.919 --> 01:00:51.087
so they can share in a kind
of awareness fulfillment,

01:00:51.221 --> 01:00:53.091
that they're otherwise denied.

01:00:55.426 --> 01:00:58.629
What? What the fuck are you talking about?

01:01:02.332 --> 01:01:03.600
No...

01:01:04.567 --> 01:01:05.602
Go on! Get out of here!

01:01:06.703 --> 01:01:08.005
Go back to where you came from!

01:01:08.138 --> 01:01:09.539
There ain't nothing here for you!

01:01:09.672 --> 01:01:10.707
Go on!

01:01:47.243 --> 01:01:49.913
Did you see that, man?

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:51.915
What the fuck did you just say?

01:01:52.049 --> 01:01:54.252
Oh, it's just an old Jewish
nursery rhyme for kids.

01:01:55.285 --> 01:01:56.420
What?

01:01:56.553 --> 01:01:57.587
Yeah, you know, it works in a pinch.

01:01:57.721 --> 01:01:59.189
But it ain't gonna work for long.

01:01:59.323 --> 01:02:00.123
You better get back to your friends.

01:02:00.256 --> 01:02:01.191
They're gonna need you.

01:02:01.325 --> 01:02:02.527
Go on.

01:02:08.364 --> 01:02:09.299
Hell yeah.

01:02:10.968 --> 01:02:12.402
Tim? Martha?

01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:13.903
- James?
- What the fuck?

01:02:14.036 --> 01:02:15.439
- James, please.
- Help us get down.

01:02:15.573 --> 01:02:16.272
- Please help us.
- Please, before he...

01:02:16.406 --> 01:02:17.408
There he is!

01:02:19.076 --> 01:02:19.977
Been waiting for you.

01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:21.444
Who the hell are you, man?

01:02:21.578 --> 01:02:22.812
What the fuck do you want?

01:02:22.946 --> 01:02:24.382
I tried to warn you.

01:02:24.515 --> 01:02:26.217
Others tried as well.

01:02:27.183 --> 01:02:28.819
The star leaf...

01:02:34.924 --> 01:02:38.763
Well, that's a special leaf, as you know.

01:02:38.895 --> 01:02:40.997
Yeah? What's so special about it, huh?

01:02:41.832 --> 01:02:43.034
It's a star gate.

01:02:44.433 --> 01:02:46.836
It opens up a door to great healing.

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:50.440
Also great chaos, if
not navigated skillfully.

01:02:50.573 --> 01:02:54.244
Through this door, all
kinds of beings emerge.

01:02:54.377 --> 01:02:56.580
Some good, some not so good.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.348
Shit.

01:03:02.218 --> 01:03:05.187
You ever ask yourself if you
really had a choice or not?

01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:07.957
Pulling that trigger? Huh?

01:03:08.091 --> 01:03:09.293
I mean, who's to say?

01:03:09.426 --> 01:03:10.694
I'm just being theoretical.

01:03:10.828 --> 01:03:13.631
But who's to say you
happened to save the lives

01:03:13.763 --> 01:03:16.800
of 13 innocent Afghan civilians.

01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:23.241
Just saying.

01:03:33.183 --> 01:03:35.518
God, I don't fucking deserve this, okay?

01:03:35.652 --> 01:03:37.788
I don't deserve this! This is bullshit!

01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:39.656
You can save them the
fate of what awaits them.

01:03:39.790 --> 01:03:42.192
Put them out of their
misery right now, hmm?

01:03:42.325 --> 01:03:44.895
Untie me, now!

01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:47.497
I just wanted to get a
little high, I'm so sorry.

01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:49.232
Will you just please shoot his ass already?

01:03:49.366 --> 01:03:50.868
Fuck you.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.435
Fuck all of you.

01:03:53.402 --> 01:03:55.805
I'm not gonna shoot my friends.

01:03:55.939 --> 01:03:58.109
I'm not shooting my friends! You hear that?

01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:00.576
I really wouldn't test them like that.

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:01.913
And you...

01:04:03.846 --> 01:04:06.750
I've had enough of your fucking bullshit.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:08.618
Easy now.

01:04:08.752 --> 01:04:11.054
Fuck easy.

01:04:11.187 --> 01:04:14.624
Why shouldn't I blow your
fucking head off, right now?

01:04:14.759 --> 01:04:16.627
Because you're not a murderer, James.

01:04:16.759 --> 01:04:19.062
A killer, maybe.

01:04:20.096 --> 01:04:21.299
But not a murderer.

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:23.533
What?

01:04:24.835 --> 01:04:26.137
Bad things happen.

01:04:27.136 --> 01:04:29.339
But you're forgiven.

01:04:29.473 --> 01:04:31.342
That's all the plant is trying to tell you.

01:04:32.808 --> 01:04:34.678
It wants to help you, James.

01:04:34.812 --> 01:04:37.314
It does. It really does.

01:04:37.446 --> 01:04:39.749
Help? It wants to help me?

01:04:39.882 --> 01:04:42.151
Is that what it wants? Huh? Huh?

01:04:42.285 --> 01:04:43.886
Is this what you think
is gonna help me? Huh?

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.888
What the fuck! Seriously?

01:04:45.022 --> 01:04:47.058
How about this? Huh?

01:04:49.225 --> 01:04:50.727
Or maybe this.

01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:55.732
You might wanna think this one through.

01:04:55.866 --> 01:04:57.468
You're making a terrible choice.

01:04:58.468 --> 01:05:00.103
You wanna see it, don't you.

01:05:00.236 --> 01:05:01.372
See what?

01:05:03.506 --> 01:05:05.108
The pink mist.

01:05:06.176 --> 01:05:07.811
James, no!

01:05:07.944 --> 01:05:09.880
Careful what you wish for.

01:05:10.013 --> 01:05:11.114
You just might find it.

01:05:12.982 --> 01:05:13.783
No, James.

01:05:14.884 --> 01:05:15.585
No!

01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:35.971
Dude...

01:05:36.105 --> 01:05:37.341
Where are we?

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:41.578
That place I was telling you about.

01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:46.784
Martha?

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:51.788
Tim?

01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:53.857
Yeah?

01:05:58.261 --> 01:05:59.263
You're okay?

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:00.696
Yeah, are you okay, dude?

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:02.498
We haven't even smoked any weed yet,

01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:04.334
and you're acting like a freak.

01:06:05.402 --> 01:06:07.071
Anyway, dude, like I was saying.

01:06:07.203 --> 01:06:08.504
In this house, there's a
dude that's gonna give us

01:06:08.638 --> 01:06:10.940
a map to the secret grove,
here in the Olympics.

01:06:11.075 --> 01:06:12.609
The stuff is called star leaf.

01:06:12.743 --> 01:06:14.811
It opens a lot of doors
to the supernatural.

01:06:14.944 --> 01:06:16.412
Are you ready? Let's go.

01:06:16.546 --> 01:06:17.515
Wait.

01:06:19.149 --> 01:06:20.750
Dude, how about the kid?

01:06:25.055 --> 01:06:26.556
What?

01:06:26.689 --> 01:06:28.325
What kid? What are you talking about?

01:06:28.457 --> 01:06:29.926
I know this sounds crazy.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.962
But, you made the right choice that day.

01:06:32.096 --> 01:06:34.197
You made the right call.

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:35.966
Wait, what kid?

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.801
Listen, man, I know you're suffering

01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:39.069
from some P.T.S.D. from then.

01:06:39.201 --> 01:06:40.370
But that's why I brought you here.

01:06:40.504 --> 01:06:41.404
We're gonna fix all that.

01:06:41.538 --> 01:06:42.772
Bullshit, man.

01:06:42.906 --> 01:06:45.208
You don't wanna put in
the real fucking work.

01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:46.843
What fucking work?

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:49.279
You saw him too.

01:06:50.379 --> 01:06:51.414
In the spotter's scope.

01:06:51.547 --> 01:06:53.350
It ain't even like that for me.

01:06:53.484 --> 01:06:54.551
I'm not mad at you.

01:06:54.683 --> 01:06:57.020
And I don't blame you for shit.

01:06:57.754 --> 01:06:59.290
I promise.

01:07:08.631 --> 01:07:11.668
You have no idea how badly I
needed to hear that from you.

01:07:12.803 --> 01:07:13.837
Come on, man.

01:07:20.676 --> 01:07:21.611
Shit.

01:07:21.745 --> 01:07:22.880
Oh, god, the federales.

01:07:23.013 --> 01:07:24.181
Let's get in. Come on!

01:07:24.314 --> 01:07:25.147
All right, these dudes mess with

01:07:25.281 --> 01:07:26.417
Black people all the time.

01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:28.618
I have a fucking thing that I do.

01:07:28.752 --> 01:07:30.421
Just shut up and listen.

01:07:34.658 --> 01:07:35.526
It's him.

01:07:35.658 --> 01:07:37.660
Who?

01:07:37.794 --> 01:07:39.863
What brings you fine
folks out to these parts?

01:07:39.995 --> 01:07:42.465
Oh, I just think we made a wrong turn.

01:07:42.598 --> 01:07:45.201
You did not make a wrong turn.

01:07:45.335 --> 01:07:47.136
You're exactly where you need to be.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.839
The question is,

01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:51.240
did you or did you not

01:07:51.373 --> 01:07:53.343
come here to purchase marijuana?

01:07:53.477 --> 01:07:54.678
Depends.

01:07:54.812 --> 01:07:56.913
You got the sticky icky?

01:07:58.549 --> 01:08:00.483
Well, if the sticky icky
is what you're looking for,

01:08:00.616 --> 01:08:02.819
my friend here, Seth,
would love to help you out.

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:09.225
Thanks, man, but we're heading out.

01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:10.927
Dude.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:11.894
Let's pull out of here,

01:08:12.027 --> 01:08:13.129
and stick to the original plan,

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:15.732
hanging out and surfing at the beach.

01:08:16.331 --> 01:08:17.933
The beach?

01:08:18.068 --> 01:08:19.136
You folks heading to La Push?

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:20.270
Yeah, but we've gotta make

01:08:20.403 --> 01:08:21.939
one little stop in Forks first.

01:08:22.072 --> 01:08:24.041
You folks must be Twilight fans then.

01:08:24.174 --> 01:08:26.042
Yeah, well, she thinks people will ask her

01:08:26.175 --> 01:08:27.943
for her autograph cause she kinda looks

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:29.979
like the chick from the movie.

01:08:30.112 --> 01:08:31.814
Yeah, do you see the resemblance?

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:37.421
No, not really.

01:08:37.554 --> 01:08:41.055
Then again, I ain't got
much time to watch movies.

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:44.760
Too busy walking the trails
with the snakes and snails.

01:08:44.894 --> 01:08:48.599
Checking the pines for
those evergreen crimes.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.102
You folks happen to see a wondering moose?

01:08:52.236 --> 01:08:53.671
Looking a little lonely?

01:08:54.837 --> 01:08:56.005
No.

01:08:56.139 --> 01:08:57.573
Well, let me know if you see him.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:09:00.009
Gotta go now. It's nice
talking to you, officer.

01:09:02.412 --> 01:09:03.846
Forest ranger...

01:09:04.747 --> 01:09:06.582
Maybe next time, man.

01:09:06.715 --> 01:09:09.319
No worries, bro. All is forgiven.

01:09:12.654 --> 01:09:13.991
All is forgiven.

01:09:16.626 --> 01:09:17.895
Get the fuck out of here, man.

01:09:37.546 --> 01:09:38.982
Little souvenir for you.

01:09:40.282 --> 01:09:42.752
The kid got his head right, after all.

01:09:43.687 --> 01:09:44.622
That he did.

01:09:45.854 --> 01:09:46.991
That he did.

01:09:55.465 --> 01:09:58.166
God damn, I came all the way back,

01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.502
to hang out with you guys,

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.673
for shit waves and no sun.

01:10:02.805 --> 01:10:05.776
What? It's beautiful!

01:10:05.908 --> 01:10:07.611
This is the high that I came for.

01:10:10.913 --> 01:10:14.084
You telling me that you
didn't already get high today?

01:10:14.218 --> 01:10:15.585
Oh, no, I totally got high today.

01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:17.453
But this is the one that I came for.

01:10:17.587 --> 01:10:18.788
You're a fucking idiot, man.

01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:20.556
Let's fucking do this, man!

01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:21.957
Don't go so fast!

01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:04.407
Nice. Yeah that's holding up really well.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.609
I see you got your 108 little beads there,

01:15:06.742 --> 01:15:08.978
to keep you occupied
while we sort this out.

01:15:09.745 --> 01:15:10.881
One for the one.

01:15:11.014 --> 01:15:12.415
Zero for the nothing.

01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:15.085
Eight for infinity.

01:15:15.218 --> 01:15:17.955
Yeah, I guess it feels like
infinity sometimes, don't it?

01:15:18.955 --> 01:15:20.090
Yeah, it's silly. I know.

01:15:20.223 --> 01:15:23.359
But, you know, rules are rules.

01:15:23.492 --> 01:15:25.261
But, I got a good feeling
about that friend of yours.

01:15:26.062 --> 01:15:27.363
Yeah, a good feeling.

01:15:28.497 --> 01:15:32.201
All right, well, shalom, shalom, baby.
