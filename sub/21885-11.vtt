WEBVTT

00:04.422 --> 00:07.425
Aaaaaah!

00:14.933 --> 00:18.561
That... was... awesome!

00:18.603 --> 00:20.021
I'm going again!
- No!

00:21.356 --> 00:23.691
I think I barfed in the nether-dimension
before we landed.

00:24.484 --> 00:26.486
Is my barf just going
to float out there forever?

00:26.528 --> 00:28.947
Is someone gonna fly through my barf
when they use the portal?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.365
Ugh, stop saying "barf."

00:30.406 --> 00:31.449
And where's Michael?

00:32.158 --> 00:33.034
He's not coming.

00:33.785 --> 00:35.703
He sacrificed himself to save me.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.997
The last thing I saw was Shawn grabbing him.

00:38.498 --> 00:41.417
Was it a nice grab or a bad grab?

00:41.793 --> 00:42.669
A bad grab.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.755
Like, a nice, bad grab,
or a mean bad grab?

00:46.214 --> 00:48.216
No Michael and no Janet.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.134
Didn't even get to say a proper goodbye.

00:51.261 --> 00:52.512
Not even a mere "toodle-loo."

00:55.431 --> 00:56.516
We're on our own.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.810
We have to handle this ourselves.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.189
Michael said the portal
would lead us to the Judge

01:03.773 --> 01:04.649
so...

01:05.567 --> 01:07.068
where's the Judge?

01:07.610 --> 01:09.112
All I see is a burrito.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.364
Do you think it's a test?

01:11.447 --> 01:14.158
Like, maybe one of us is supposed to eat it

01:14.200 --> 01:16.744
or... or we eat it together,
or... or... maybe...

01:17.161 --> 01:19.872
maybe it's a test to see
how long we can go without eating it.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.041
I'm not scared of any burrito. I'll eat it.

01:24.544 --> 01:25.628
Unless...

01:26.004 --> 01:28.256
the burrito <i>is</i> the Judge.

01:28.298 --> 01:30.383
Don't be so bloody ridiculous.

01:30.425 --> 01:32.468
Judges aren't food.
Judges are serious people

01:32.510 --> 01:35.430
who wear long silk nightgowns
and big white powdered wigs.

01:35.471 --> 01:36.347
Eh-eh...

01:36.723 --> 01:37.599
he could be right.

01:37.807 --> 01:38.766
- What?
- Really?

01:38.808 --> 01:39.767
I don't know.

01:39.809 --> 01:42.061
I'm just saying,
we've certainly seen weirder things

01:42.103 --> 01:43.438
than an all-knowing burrito.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.356
We can't take any chances.

01:46.149 --> 01:49.777
Hello, Your Excellency.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

01:49.819 --> 01:51.404
We doth seek thine judgment.

01:51.446 --> 01:54.616
We've traveled a long distance
to see you, O great one...

01:55.867 --> 01:57.076
What are you guys looking at?

01:58.161 --> 01:59.037
Hi.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.080
I'm the Judge. That's a burrito.

02:01.497 --> 02:02.874
What's up, guys?

02:10.131 --> 02:12.133
Yeah, I did not think I had a case today.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.718
The paperwork should have shown up by now

02:13.760 --> 02:16.429
unless, you guys just, like, came here?

02:17.972 --> 02:19.599
Wait, did you guys just come here?

02:21.017 --> 02:22.143
Oh, my God.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.770
You guys are bad.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.438
Which one is the worst one of you?

02:25.480 --> 02:26.356
Is it you, glasses?

02:27.148 --> 02:28.274
Oh, I bet it's you.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.235
OK, yeah... well,
we did just sort of "show up"

02:31.277 --> 02:33.237
but we had to, we were escaping
the Bad Place.

02:33.279 --> 02:34.447
Mm-hm.
- Which now that I think about it

02:34.489 --> 02:36.616
there might be some demons following us.

02:36.658 --> 02:39.577
Oh, don't worry about that.
Any time anyone shows up in my chambers

02:39.619 --> 02:41.829
the portal is sealed until I issue my ruling.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.289
So, you guys can relax.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.248
Get comfortable.

02:46.501 --> 02:48.795
A classic St Crispin's Day
Garden Party Frock.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.505
Wait - is it after 4PM?

02:50.963 --> 02:51.839
Not important.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.341
Let's have a look at your files.

02:54.676 --> 02:56.010
Wait, you don't already know
everything about us?

02:56.052 --> 02:57.178
You're not omniscient?

02:57.220 --> 02:59.389
Well, not in the way you mean.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.475
I try to learn as little as I can
about the events of humankind

03:02.517 --> 03:05.019
so I can remain impartial,
cos I'm a judge, yada-yada-yada.

03:06.104 --> 03:08.690
That being said, sometimes I get bored
and I cheat a little bit.

03:08.731 --> 03:11.109
I've been bingeing
Ken Burns' "Vietnam" recently.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.026
It's OK.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.403
I mean, I'm immortal

03:13.444 --> 03:15.905
but that thing is loooong!

03:15.947 --> 03:17.115
You know what I'm saying?

03:17.615 --> 03:19.617
Anyway, your petition is denied,
I can't hear your case.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.160
Please exit to the rear.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.496
What?

03:23.538 --> 03:26.040
I just absorbed the entirety
of your existences

03:26.082 --> 03:30.586
and I just want to say, you guys are so cute.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.171
And the thing is

03:32.213 --> 03:34.132
you didn't file any paperwork,
and you have no advocate

03:34.173 --> 03:36.384
and the rules say I gotta... pbfft!

03:37.176 --> 03:38.052
Send you back.

03:38.094 --> 03:38.970
Your honour.

03:39.846 --> 03:41.139
Please hear our case.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.349
You frankly wouldn't believe
what we have been through

03:43.391 --> 03:44.600
just to be here today.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.895
I mean, I would, because I just learned
everything about you

03:47.937 --> 03:53.025
but keep talking,
I am, like, obsessed with your accent.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.069
We have made so much progress

03:55.111 --> 03:58.239
and all we ask is an audience with you,
to prove it.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.909
Is that not your very purpose?
To weigh in on matters such as ours?

04:01.951 --> 04:04.328
To paraphrase a song written
by my godfather -

04:04.912 --> 04:07.123
"Hey Judge, don't make it bad."

04:07.790 --> 04:10.168
"Take a sad group, and make us better."

04:11.377 --> 04:12.253
Say "aluminum."

04:12.754 --> 04:14.714
"Alu-minnium."

04:14.756 --> 04:15.757
I love that!

04:16.174 --> 04:17.633
And I love your passion.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.470
I mean, it takes a lot of guts
to just show up here unannounced.

04:20.887 --> 04:22.722
Plus, I haven't had a case in, like, 30 years

04:22.764 --> 04:24.807
and I'm super bored.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.351
So, it's either this or start "Bloodline"

04:27.393 --> 04:28.311
and I don't know

04:28.352 --> 04:31.355
I just don't feel like I can see
Kyle Chandler as anyone else

04:31.397 --> 04:32.565
but Coach Taylor.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.235
Ssssso, the case?

04:36.611 --> 04:37.487
Right!

04:39.489 --> 04:40.364
Let's do it.

04:43.159 --> 04:46.412
You had one job.
Torture four bad people forever.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.498
Not only did you fail, you're a traitor.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.334
You really junked your jeans on this one,
you butterface.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.627
I did what I had to do.

04:53.044 --> 04:54.921
Oh, you <i>had</i> to junk your jeans?

04:56.130 --> 04:58.508
How could you betray your own kind like this?

04:58.549 --> 05:00.927
Who taught you
how to turn a human inside out

05:00.968 --> 05:03.721
by reaching down their throat
and grabbing their butt from the inside?

05:03.763 --> 05:06.265
You did.
- You got that right, sister.

05:07.183 --> 05:08.559
And this is how you repay me.

05:08.601 --> 05:11.062
Oh, spare me the sanctimonious lecture.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.563
You never cared about me.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.690
In the words of one of my actual friends -

05:15.024 --> 05:15.942
"Ya basic!"

05:16.651 --> 05:18.277
It's a human insult.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.320
It's devastating.

05:19.779 --> 05:21.239
You're devastated right now.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.323
The point is...

05:22.865 --> 05:24.867
the four of them are in front of the Judge

05:24.909 --> 05:27.245
and the Good Janet has escaped too

05:27.286 --> 05:28.246
you'll never find her.

05:28.871 --> 05:29.997
Oh, you mean this...

05:30.206 --> 05:31.082
Good Janet?

05:31.123 --> 05:33.251
I found her in, like, two seconds.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.295
She was wandering the halls
being polite to people.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.547
Like a chump.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.340
So, I marble-ised her.

05:39.757 --> 05:40.716
Keep her if you want.

05:41.092 --> 05:43.261
Maybe shove it up your weiner
for safekeeping. I don't know.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.012
It's up to you.
- Poor Janet.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.306
She was a good friend.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.224
Friend?

05:49.559 --> 05:51.227
What kind of monster aren't you?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.521
I'm going to give each of you a test

05:53.563 --> 05:55.106
to see how much progress you've made

05:55.523 --> 05:57.483
and if I deem you fit
to be in the Good Place

05:57.525 --> 05:59.235
then... zoop!

05:59.735 --> 06:00.611
Up you go!

06:01.112 --> 06:04.574
Well, actually, sort of... that way. Zurp!

06:04.615 --> 06:06.450
Great. Can we be tested together
as a group?

06:06.659 --> 06:08.744
Yeah, we all need to be able to cheat
off Chidi.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.665
Oh! That's why your name is "Chidi."

06:12.707 --> 06:14.333
I get it now.

06:14.667 --> 06:17.295
I'm sorry, cuties.
The tests have to be individual.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.921
Well, can we be graded as a group then?

06:19.422 --> 06:22.550
The only reason we've come this far
is because we've helped each other.

06:22.842 --> 06:25.219
And I don't think anything's
gonna feel like the Good Place

06:25.261 --> 06:26.429
if we're not together.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.723
So, if you all pass, you're in.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.643
And if even one of you fails,
you're all effed.

06:33.019 --> 06:33.895
Right?

06:34.228 --> 06:35.605
Terrible idea.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.024
I mean, truly awful.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.694
You are very lucky that I cannot send you
to the Bad Idea Place

06:41.736 --> 06:43.487
because that one is a stanker.

06:43.946 --> 06:45.740
But whatever blows your dress up.
I mean, am I right?

06:46.616 --> 06:47.491
Hold on.

06:49.035 --> 06:52.163
Guys, whatever these tests might be,
we can hack it.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.999
I mean, think about
all the scary stuff we've seen.

06:55.041 --> 06:57.543
All the times we were almost captured
by demons.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.421
And worst of all,
the time that Chidi told us

07:00.463 --> 07:02.089
when we finished a book, we'd get a treat

07:02.131 --> 07:04.133
and the treat turned out to be another book.

07:04.175 --> 07:05.551
Books can be treats.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.928
I am not having this argument again.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.721
Point is, we got this.

07:08.763 --> 07:11.766
We are Team Cockroach.
We can pass these tests.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.017
I believe in us.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.185
We'll start with Jason.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.687
Oh, no. We're doomed.
- Ugh!

07:16.729 --> 07:18.981
Oh, sorry, I mean - good luck!

07:21.025 --> 07:22.276
Jason...
- Present!

07:22.610 --> 07:23.486
Good.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.822
In front of you is a video game system
loaded with Madden football.

07:26.864 --> 07:29.575
Are you kidding me?
I'm the best at Madden.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.701
I call Jaguars!

07:31.535 --> 07:33.454
As I was about to tell you

07:33.496 --> 07:36.123
you can only play against the Jaguars...

07:36.165 --> 07:37.124
No!

07:37.166 --> 07:39.877
using their archrivals, the Tennessee Titans.
- No!

07:39.919 --> 07:41.212
If you play the game and you lose...

07:41.253 --> 07:42.546
Oh! I'm gonna win.

07:42.922 --> 07:44.256
Say no more, scary Judge lady.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.258
Tell my friends
their souls are in good hands.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.345
Oh, no! I fumbled the kickoff!

07:50.054 --> 07:51.514
Titans suck!

07:54.642 --> 07:56.477
"Tahani." It's such a pretty name.

07:57.228 --> 07:58.479
My name is super boring

07:58.980 --> 07:59.855
Jen.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.816
Which is short for "hydrogen"

08:01.899 --> 08:04.944
which was the only thing that was
in existence at the time that I was born.

08:05.861 --> 08:06.737
Anywho...

08:07.363 --> 08:09.782
all you have to do is go through there

08:10.241 --> 08:13.452
walk down the hallway,
and through the red door at the end.

08:14.412 --> 08:17.248
That's it? That's my test?
- Yup!

08:17.665 --> 08:20.418
Oh, also, everyone in every room
that you pass

08:20.459 --> 08:22.586
is going to be discussing
what they truly think about you.

08:23.838 --> 08:24.922
OK, have fun!

08:37.101 --> 08:38.561
Oh, I see.

08:39.478 --> 08:43.024
It's a test of my ability
to not care what people think of me.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.944
Oh, no!

08:47.445 --> 08:50.364
So, just to be clear, you actually rebooted
them over 800 times.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.159
And all of these reports of their "torture"
are completely fake?

08:53.576 --> 08:55.619
Yes. But, frankly, this is on you.

08:56.203 --> 09:00.166
A lot of those details I just took directly
from Stephen King novels

09:00.207 --> 09:01.959
and episodes of "Pretty Little Liars."

09:02.001 --> 09:03.794
Just tell me why.
Why would you do this?

09:03.836 --> 09:05.171
It's not like I planned it!

09:05.212 --> 09:09.133
I was just trying to prove that humans
could be made to torture each other.

09:09.175 --> 09:12.344
Instead, they helped each other,
and got better.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.348
They were bad people -
this is not supposed to be possible.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.018
So, the only explanation is that somehow

09:19.393 --> 09:23.022
there was a mistake made,
and these people belong in the Good Place.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.565
No, they don't, idiot.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.734
Shawn, this is not fair.
- Pfft.

09:27.151 --> 09:30.112
"Fair" is the stupidest word
humans ever invented.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.490
Except for... "stay-cation."
- Ew.

09:32.948 --> 09:35.159
Look, those four humans are good people

09:35.451 --> 09:37.578
and they deserve a "stay-cation"

09:37.620 --> 09:40.998
in the Good Place, and I bet the Judge
will feel the same way.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.708
I doubt she even hears their case.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.626
But if she does...

09:44.460 --> 09:45.920
one of them will screw it up,
they always do.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.547
I'm sick of smelling
this guy's lumpy white ass.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.175
Can we get rid of him already?
- Yep. It's time.

09:51.217 --> 09:52.384
Follow me.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.970
OK.
Eleanor and Chidi.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.889
Looks like you guys are up.

09:56.931 --> 09:57.807
At the same time?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.141
Yup!

10:13.030 --> 10:14.073
Trippy, right?

10:14.115 --> 10:16.325
There is no test. You guys are in!

10:17.368 --> 10:19.120
We're... "in?"
What does that mean?

10:19.161 --> 10:21.413
You guys have made great strides
and you've made it to the Good Place.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.498
Congrats.

10:22.540 --> 10:23.916
Take these medallions

10:23.958 --> 10:26.085
and go right through that portal
and you're there in a jiff.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.255
We made it.
- We made it.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.172
Holy crap!

10:30.256 --> 10:32.216
Whoo!

10:32.258 --> 10:34.176
All those ethics lessons paid off.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.970
Whoever said philosophy was stupid?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.138
You! You did

10:37.179 --> 10:39.098
many times,
as recently as this morning.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.851
Whoo!
- But... but you also worked really hard

10:41.892 --> 10:43.477
and you deserve this.

10:43.519 --> 10:44.478
You really do.

10:45.271 --> 10:47.231
Here's the thing though,
it's just the two of you.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.525
Tahani and Jason didn't make it.

10:49.567 --> 10:52.319
I'm giving them tests right now
to determine where they belong

10:52.361 --> 10:53.487
within the Bad Place.

10:53.529 --> 10:57.199
So, you might want to reconsider
that "judge us together" thing

10:57.241 --> 10:59.034
cos if you stick to that,
you're all going down.

10:59.410 --> 11:01.245
Now, you can wait here
to say your goodbyes

11:01.287 --> 11:03.330
or you can just take off now.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.957
It's totally up to you guys.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.336
I am so hungry. Why am I so hungry?

11:09.837 --> 11:13.215
Oh my... I'm such an idiot.
I forgot to eat my burrito

11:13.257 --> 11:16.218
and I was so hungry, too. What a dork.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.974
OK, obviously <i>this</i> is the test, right?

11:22.016 --> 11:25.019
I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani
the same offer

11:25.060 --> 11:27.771
and whichever couple takes it actually loses

11:28.105 --> 11:29.231
and the other two get in for real.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.276
Oh, diabolical.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.736
Hey, Judge

11:33.777 --> 11:35.070
we figured out what you're really...
- Nope!

11:35.487 --> 11:37.907
Tahani and Jason
have not been given the same offer.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.450
Here, take a look.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.369
Tahani's test is to walk down a hallway

11:42.411 --> 11:44.455
and not get tempted
by her gossiping friends.

11:45.206 --> 11:46.665
Jason is playing video games.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.334
Oh. OK, cool.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.796
Sorry, I... I feel weird saying this
to an almighty Judge

11:52.838 --> 11:54.381
but you have hot sauce on your chin.

11:54.965 --> 11:55.841
Thank you.

11:56.717 --> 11:57.801
It's actually not hot sauce.

11:58.844 --> 11:59.720
It's "envy."

12:00.221 --> 12:01.472
Or the concept of envy.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.808
It's really good on Mexican food,
it gives it a little kick.

12:06.977 --> 12:07.978
OK, so what do we do?

12:09.980 --> 12:12.691
Oh, no. That was your "moral quandary"
grimace.

12:13.025 --> 12:15.110
Which is different
from your "gas pain" grimace.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.114
And different from your
"someone said 'from whence it came'"

12:19.156 --> 12:20.699
"instead of 'whence it came'" grimace.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.786
So, spit it out, man!

12:23.827 --> 12:25.871
Well, if... if this isn't a test

12:26.163 --> 12:28.290
then it's something way worse.

12:28.624 --> 12:29.833
What?
- A choice!

12:31.043 --> 12:32.711
That we have to make.
- Yeah

12:32.753 --> 12:35.047
you know, why can't one part

12:35.089 --> 12:37.591
of the calculation
of our eternal fate be easy?

12:37.633 --> 12:39.009
I don't know.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.566
Quevenzhané Wallis and Stephen Hawking

12:54.608 --> 12:57.111
in the same room, discussing me?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.906
I guess they must have made up.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.241
Focus...

13:03.367 --> 13:05.411
There'll be Fergies a-plenty
in the Good Place.

13:16.171 --> 13:19.216
I don't know
where we went wrong with Tahani.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.635
I know.
She is such a disappointment

13:21.677 --> 13:22.720
compared to her sister.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.638
Hello, Father.

13:25.431 --> 13:26.390
Hello, Mother.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.517
Oh! Hello, Tahani.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.229
We were just talking about
how you're a huge disappointment

13:32.271 --> 13:33.439
compared to your sister.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.358
Have a seat.
We'd love to get your take.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.446
How's it going in here?
- I'm losing by three.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.489
Meditating to calm myself down.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.784
I'd be winning by like a million
if I could play as the Jags

13:45.826 --> 13:47.870
instead of playing against the Jags

13:47.911 --> 13:51.415
I hate scoring
against my own favourite team.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.755
But you already knew that.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.632
Because this is the test!

14:00.674 --> 14:02.801
Yeah, that's not a revelation or something.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.428
I explained that very clearly.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.598
It's nice to see you, Tahani.

14:07.931 --> 14:11.977
Apparently, wherever you've been,
they've been keeping you well-fed.

14:13.645 --> 14:17.524
You know, I've actually risked quite a lot
to be in this room right now

14:17.566 --> 14:21.028
so if you could just not be cruel
for maybe 30 seconds

14:21.070 --> 14:21.987
that would be lovely.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.032
Apologies. It's been a while
since we've seen you.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.035
We have so much to tell you
about your sister!

14:28.077 --> 14:31.205
We've just heard the most wonderful news

14:31.246 --> 14:34.708
Kamilah dedicated her last album to you.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.543
Really?
- Well...

14:36.585 --> 14:40.464
she dedicated it to her fans,
and you're one of her fans.

14:41.965 --> 14:45.094
The whole point of this afterlife test

14:45.636 --> 14:49.139
is that everyone in these rooms
is supposed to be talking about me

14:49.848 --> 14:55.562
and yet even in this scenario,
you are still talking about Kamilah!

14:58.565 --> 15:00.025
Which is exactly the point.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.655
I was never going to be enough for you

15:05.155 --> 15:06.407
never going to earn your respect.

15:07.199 --> 15:11.370
You know, I have done things
that you would never have approved of.

15:11.412 --> 15:14.706
I died dressed as someone
in the service industry

15:15.541 --> 15:19.169
I shagged a Floridian,
I even ate a Cheeto.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.421
That's right.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.090
I ate a lumpy witch's finger

15:23.132 --> 15:25.759
made of neon orange corn foam.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.719
Chewing it was deafening.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.972
And it's the happiest I have ever been.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.348
Don't get upset, dear.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.308
You barely fit in that dress

15:33.350 --> 15:36.687
and I'm afraid you're going to "Hulk out"
as it were.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.604
OK.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.901
I'm sorry we didn't have
a better relationship.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.654
And I wish you the both the best.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.584
Alright, idiot. Any last words?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.919
Just go ahead and retire me already.

16:01.587 --> 16:03.172
Oh, you're not getting retired, Michael.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.506
I'm not?
- No.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.841
Retirement is a spectacle.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.302
Everyone would see the flaming ladles
go down your throat

16:08.760 --> 16:10.345
everyone would hear your eternal
shrieks of agony

16:10.387 --> 16:12.431
blah, blah, blah.
Then they'd ask me what you did.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.391
I don't need that kind of scrutiny right now.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.311
So, I'm just going to throw you
in this unmarked room

16:17.352 --> 16:18.479
for the rest of eternity.

16:20.189 --> 16:23.192
And since it seems you love humans so much,
I'll torture you like one.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.653
All you'll have for entertainment
is that giant stack

16:26.695 --> 16:27.988
of New Yorker Magazines.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.243
Oh, come on. You and I both know
I'll never read those.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.453
Of course you won't.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.540
But they'll just keep coming.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.087
Goodbye, Michael.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.965
We will leave you with one
of Bad Janet's classic farts.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.427
The smell will linger for ten million years.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.263
Alright! Here comes the boom!

16:53.680 --> 16:54.890
Oh, wait... actually

16:55.307 --> 16:58.018
before I absolutely let it rip

16:58.060 --> 16:59.478
I just have one more thing I have to do.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.395
What?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.944
It's me! Good Janet!
- Janet?

17:07.778 --> 17:10.322
I thought you were a marble.
- That was a trick!

17:10.697 --> 17:13.575
I realised if we wanted our friends
to have any chance of survival

17:13.617 --> 17:16.787
I had to learn how to do a lot of bad things,
really quickly.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.080
So, I did!

17:18.664 --> 17:20.249
Now I'm ready to go back to being nice again.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.750
Ugh! What happened?

17:24.962 --> 17:26.421
OK, now I'll be nice again.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.717
Could you please stop doing that?

17:31.593 --> 17:32.719
It helps me think.

17:35.556 --> 17:36.682
We've been through every argument

17:37.266 --> 17:41.562
contractualist, Kantian,
"what would Superman do?"

17:41.603 --> 17:43.272
"What would Rihanna do?"

17:43.855 --> 17:45.148
Are we missing anything?

17:45.941 --> 17:49.403
Hit me, right now
with your most obscure, boring-est

17:49.444 --> 17:53.365
old-white-dude-with-a-long-wizard-beard
mumbo-jumbo.

17:53.407 --> 17:57.494
OK, our friends are going to the Bad Place.

17:58.120 --> 18:02.791
And us choosing to go with them
won't lessen their suffering.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.293
So...

18:05.419 --> 18:06.545
morally

18:07.546 --> 18:08.547
we're allowed to go.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.258
But let's forget about the ethics
for a second.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.221
After everything that's happened,
don't we deserve to be together...

18:17.889 --> 18:19.766
and happy, for once?

18:24.646 --> 18:27.149
- Judge?
- Have you made your decision?

18:27.733 --> 18:28.609
Yeah.

18:29.860 --> 18:30.986
We're not going to the Good Place.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.488
I mean, that was never actually an option

18:33.530 --> 18:35.741
but for the sake of your test,
we're not going.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.409
What do you mean?

18:37.451 --> 18:40.787
Well, I was 99% sure
that going was the wrong move

18:40.829 --> 18:44.082
but since our whole relationship
has been me being sure of something

18:44.124 --> 18:46.043
and Chidi explaining why I was wrong

18:46.335 --> 18:48.629
I owed it to him to quadruple-check.

18:48.879 --> 18:52.758
The capper came
when I realised, that ain't Chidi.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.762
The Chidi I know wouldn't argue that
he should be rewarded

18:56.803 --> 18:57.929
while his friends got punished

18:57.971 --> 19:00.932
and he would never
"forget about ethics for a second."

19:01.683 --> 19:04.519
I don't know who this joker is,
but it's not Chidi Anagonye.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.896
Wait, but what about the...?

19:07.481 --> 19:09.066
Well done, Eleanor.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.318
You can take a seat and wait for the others.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.780
And can I have that medallion back?
Cos it's actually a coaster, for my sodas.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.697
Mm-hm.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.617
Where is the real Chidi, though?
Is he OK?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.327
He's still taking his test.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.082
OK, this is ridiculous. Um...

19:26.875 --> 19:27.793
I'm just gonna choose...

19:30.879 --> 19:31.755
brown.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.759
Gray's the obvious choice,
which is probably why I shouldn't choose it.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.220
Brown. Nope. Gray.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.723
Nope. Brown. Brown hat.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.188
Alright, fun stuff.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.856
Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:49.898 --> 19:50.774
Feeling good?

19:50.816 --> 19:51.942
Very. Yeah.
- I think so, yes.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.026
Great.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.278
You're all going to the Bad Place.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.783
OK, um...

20:00.325 --> 20:04.037
if I was the one who failed,
could you at least tell me why I failed

20:04.079 --> 20:05.080
for my own edification?

20:05.539 --> 20:07.833
I too would like to know if I failed.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.378
I didn't fail, so go ahead,
tell them what you want.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.880
Last second field goal, won by three.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.382
Pretty dope.

20:15.841 --> 20:16.800
Chidi.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.761
It took you 82 minutes to choose a hat.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.930
But did I at least choose the right one?

20:21.972 --> 20:23.974
There is no right one. They're hats.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.183
Come on, man!

20:27.477 --> 20:30.939
Tahani, you skipped a lot of rooms
that I thought would entice you

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
but you weren't
supposed to open any doors

20:33.316 --> 20:35.235
and you couldn't resist confronting
your parents.

20:35.902 --> 20:36.987
Sorry, everyone.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.697
But now that I failed

20:38.947 --> 20:41.867
can I go back in and talk
to Winston Churchill and Freddie Mercury?

20:41.908 --> 20:42.784
No.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.704
Jason, your test
was about impulse control

20:45.746 --> 20:47.789
and you showed great improvements.

20:48.331 --> 20:52.043
But you never asked
if you could opt not to play.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.921
I mean, you basically told me

20:55.881 --> 20:59.384
an all-knowing Judge,
to just shut up and go away.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.262
Do you realise how insane that is?

21:03.263 --> 21:06.641
Not as insane as picking off
the greatest quarterback of all time

21:06.683 --> 21:09.561
Blake Bortles, to set-up
a last-second game-winning field goal.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.484
Now, Eleanor's test
was about her selfishness

21:15.525 --> 21:17.486
and she actually...
- I failed.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.573
I shoved an old lady down the stairs
to get to the raw bar...

21:21.990 --> 21:24.075
because I'm a shrimp fiend

21:24.117 --> 21:26.077
so, we all failed, let's not dwell on it.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.415
Alright. Shall we?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.548
Oh, I am gonna miss you guys.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.509
I made a little video of our time together.

21:40.926 --> 21:44.596
<i>♪ Did you ever know
that you're my hero? ♪</i>

21:44.638 --> 21:45.597
Oh, look! There we are!

21:45.972 --> 21:48.850
You know, I thought I'd have
a stomachache right now, but weirdly...

21:49.142 --> 21:51.144
<i>♪ And everything I would like... ♪</i>

21:51.186 --> 21:52.062
...I do.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.313
There's my guy.

21:53.688 --> 21:55.232
What?
- Doesn't matter.

21:55.607 --> 21:56.483
I'm gonna miss you, bud.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.320
Every time they pull my eyeballs out
through my mouth, I'll think of you.

22:02.864 --> 22:03.782
I'm gonna frame that one.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.117
We gave it our best shot, guys.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.953
I say we go through the portal

22:08.203 --> 22:09.246
get a good night's sleep

22:09.871 --> 22:11.206
come back fresh in the morning.

22:12.040 --> 22:12.916
Try again.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.292
Oh, Jason.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.046
I feel like you always understand
about 20% of what's happening.

22:18.797 --> 22:20.048
Thanks.
- Sure.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.508
<i>♪ You are the wind... ♪</i>

22:21.550 --> 22:22.884
I mean, look at us.

22:22.926 --> 22:23.802
<i>♪ ...beneath my wings. ♪</i>

22:23.844 --> 22:25.554
Ah, good times.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.556
Alright, off to eternal damnation!

22:28.807 --> 22:29.766
Do you hear something?

22:32.519 --> 22:33.395
Oh!

22:34.020 --> 22:36.398
Hey, guys! How you been?
