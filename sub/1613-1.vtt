us a billion years ago.

02:10.365 --> 02:13.041
Lucy. It's easy as pie.

02:13.147 --> 02:16.224
- In and out, all done and dusted.
- And why don't you do it yourself?

02:16.328 --> 02:20.104
The last thing the guy's expecting is a
total 10 turning up to deliver the case.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.107

myself right now. I gotta...

02:45.316 --> 02:47.673

concentrate on so many things.

Hey, hey. What are you doing?

02:50.155 --> 02:52.428

I have exams on Monday.

02:52.532 --> 02:55.598
I have to shower and I
have to study, okay?

02:55.702 --> 02:57.933
You know what? The other day,
I was in this museum.

02:58.038 --> 03:00.102

03:00.206 --> 03:02.563
The first ever woman was named Lucy.

03:07.464 --> 03:11.488
- Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- Yeah. No.

03:11.593 --> 03:14.992
- I'll call you. Okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.662
I'll be honest with you.
I can't deliver the case myself.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.471
I had a little falling-out with the guy.
It's nothing major,

in there, you go up to the reception,

Come on.

03:39.662 --> 03:42.602

- I don't know, it's just some paperwork.

03:42.706 --> 03:43.687

03:54.593 --> 03:56.283
Okay! We are negotiating now or...

I want to know how much.

It's probably just some designs they
switched so they can copy them.

20:24.999 --> 20:26.272
THE LIMEY: Okay.

20:26.376 --> 20:28.942
Right. Um... First of all,

20:29.254 --> 20:31.819
many thanks for taking
part in this enterprise,

20:31.924 --> 20:36.824
which I'm sure will go off flawlessly.
These lovely passports and tickets

20:36.929 --> 20:40.453

20:40.766 --> 20:44.582

taken in hand by our people,

20:44.686 --> 20:47.043
so that we might recover
our merchandise

20:47.231 --> 20:51.129

which you so richly deserve.

but for any of those who may be tempted

Anyway, gentlemen, madam,

21:38.031 --> 21:43.433
NORMAN: For primitive beings like us,
life seems to have only one single purpose,

21:43.537 --> 21:44.934
gaining time.

21:45.831 --> 21:49.271
And it is going through
time that seems to be also

21:49.375 --> 21:52.734
the only real purpose of each
of the cells in our bodies.

21:53.172 --> 21:55.904
To achieve that aim,
the mass of the cells

21:56.008 --> 22:01.491
that make up earthworms and human
beings has only two solutions.

22:01.722 --> 22:06.080
Be immortal... or to reproduce.

22:06.185 --> 22:10.460
If its habitat is not sufficiently
favorable or nurturing...

22:17.863 --> 22:20.094
The cell will choose immortality.

22:20.199 --> 22:24.432
In other words, self-sufficiency
and self-management.

22:24.912 --> 22:28.269
On the other hand, if the
habitat is favorable...

22:33.337 --> 22:35.318
They will choose to reproduce.

22:44.598 --> 22:49.791
That way, when they die, they hand down
essential information and knowledge

22:49.895 --> 22:53.251
to the next cell, which hands it
down to the next cell and so on.

23:05.411 --> 23:10.435
Thus, knowledge and learning
are handed down through time.

23:12.166 --> 23:16.942

You have to wait. Just play for time.

23:19.967 --> 23:24.158
Take the flight, get out of here. That's
the main thing right now. Just save time.

23:24.263 --> 23:27.202
Don't try anything.
Keep your cool. You're alive.

23:27.306 --> 23:31.124
You're alive, babe. You're alive.
That's all that matters. Just wait.

Let's imagine for a few moments

26:09.261 --> 26:12.868
what our life would be like if
we could access, let's say,

26:13.097 --> 26:16.080
20% of our brain's capacity.

26:16.185 --> 26:22.586
This first stage would give us access
to and control of our own body.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.755
- Sir?
- Yes.

26:25.234 --> 26:26.758
Has it been proved scientifically?

26:26.862 --> 26:32.702
For the moment, it's just hypothesis,
I confess. But if you think about it,

26:32.807 --> 26:37.518
it's troubling to realize that the Greeks,
the Egyptians and the Indians

26:37.623 --> 26:42.148
had notion of cells centuries before
the invention of the microscope.

26:42.502 --> 26:44.192
And what to say about Darwin,

26:44.296 --> 26:48.570
whom everybody took for a fool when
he put forth his theory of evolution.

26:48.674 --> 26:52.199
It's up to us to push

26:52.303 --> 26:54.910

There are more connections in the human

27:08.569 --> 27:12.469
We possess a gigantic

27:12.573 --> 27:15.181

27:17.036 --> 27:18.225

- Yes.

27:18.538 --> 27:20.102
And what will be the next stage?

27:20.499 --> 27:23.731
Well, the next stage would probably
be control of other people.

27:24.670 --> 27:29.444
But for that, we would need to access
at least 40% of our brain's capacity.

27:30.217 --> 27:35.742
After control of ourselves and
others would come control of matter.

27:37.140 --> 27:39.955

How did you manage to
access all this information?

01:08:13.407 --> 01:08:18.099
Electrical impulses. Every cell
knows and talks to every other cell.

01:08:18.203 --> 01:08:21.519
They exchange a thousand bits of
information between them per second.

01:08:21.624 --> 01:08:25.189
Cells group together,
forming a giant web of communication,

01:08:25.294 --> 01:08:26.733
which in turn forms matter.

01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:30.737
Cells get together, take on one form,

it's all the same.

01:08:36.471 --> 01:08:39.828
Humans consider themselves unique,
so they've rooted their whole theory

01:08:39.934 --> 01:08:43.917
of existence on their uniqueness.
"One" is their unit of measure.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:48.546
But it's not. All social systems we've
put into place are a mere sketch.

01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:51.174
One plus one equals two.
That's all we've learned.

01:08:51.278 --> 01:08:54.344
But one plus one has
never equaled two.

01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:57.389
There are, in fact,
no numbers and no letters.

01:08:57.493 --> 01:09:01.059

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:07.941
We've created a scale so that we
can forget its unfathomable scale.

the unit of measure

01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:16.825

So what proof do we
have of its existence?

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:40.390
Time gives legitimacy to its existence.
Time is the only true unit of measure.

01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:43.643
It gives proof to the
existence of matter.
