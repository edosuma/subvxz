[Maya] <i>You know how Drake says,</i>

00:06.931 --> 00:08.265
<i>"Started from the
bottom, now we're here"?</i>

00:08.348 --> 00:11.936
<i>And, yes, he's talking about the cutthroat
world of the hip-hop industry, but...</i>

00:12.019 --> 00:14.021
<i>that idea could also apply
to the first day of school.</i>

00:14.104 --> 00:15.397
<i>I mean, today, we're at the bottom,</i>

00:15.481 --> 00:17.650
<i>but from here, anything's possible.</i>

00:17.733 --> 00:19.068
<i>Who cares who you were last year?</i>

00:19.151 --> 00:20.736
<i>Haters gonna hate, but it's like,</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:22.447
<i>we get to choose.</i>

00:25.115 --> 00:26.742
<i>Bully or bullied?</i>

00:30.245 --> 00:32.206
<i>Leader or loser?</i>

00:32.873 --> 00:34.417
<i>Most likely to run the world...</i>

00:34.500 --> 00:37.002
<i>or most likely to blow it up?</i>

00:37.086 --> 00:38.796
<i>No one makes it overnight.</i>

00:38.879 --> 00:40.297
Okay, you've gotta work
hard and make good choices.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.008
And if I do that, there's no reason
why I can't be the next T-Swift,

00:43.092 --> 00:44.384
or something even more amazing.

00:45.470 --> 00:48.138
[chuckles] You have pretty lips.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.432
[scoffs]

00:51.391 --> 00:54.019
Okay, I don't think doing
this on the first day

00:54.103 --> 00:55.646
qualifies as a good choice.

00:55.730 --> 00:58.023
- Well, I disagree.
- [scoffs] Zig, I have a plan.

00:58.107 --> 01:01.068
I wanna put together a band, make
music that makes an impression.

01:01.151 --> 01:02.778
- I wanna...
- Be amazing.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.279
[sighs] The ears do work.

01:04.363 --> 01:06.031
And I want all that, too, Maya,

01:06.115 --> 01:07.908
but what I want now is...

01:12.455 --> 01:14.915
Next on our school
tour, it's... Oh, my God!

01:14.999 --> 01:16.333
- Oh, God.
- [students clamoring]

01:16.416 --> 01:19.378
Oh, my God! I love high school.

01:19.461 --> 01:20.505
[Frankie] Go, go.

01:20.588 --> 01:21.672
[Maya sighs]

01:21.756 --> 01:23.924
Well, you definitely made
an impression on that kid.

01:24.008 --> 01:26.176

01:58.584 --> 02:00.044
[Ms. Badger] And that, my friends,

02:00.127 --> 02:02.922
was your first chemistry
lesson of the new school year.

02:03.005 --> 02:04.882
- Any questions?
- Uh, yeah.

02:04.965 --> 02:06.759
Will we be covering Heisenberg this year?

02:06.842 --> 02:10.054
Apologies, Tiny, you'll have
to wait until grade 12 for that.

02:10.137 --> 02:11.180
[bell ringing]

02:18.103 --> 02:21.106
- What?
- Uh... you're smart.

02:21.190 --> 02:23.025
You seem surprised.

02:23.108 --> 02:24.318
It's because I'm black, isn't it?

02:24.401 --> 02:26.320
What? No! I...

02:26.403 --> 02:27.947
- I...
- [chuckles]

02:28.030 --> 02:29.574
- [chuckles]
- Chill.

02:29.657 --> 02:31.826
You seem pretty smart, too.

02:31.909 --> 02:33.452
You're the only sophomore in grade 11 chem.

02:36.205 --> 02:37.289
Thanks.

02:40.876 --> 02:43.337
Ooh. Looks like someone's got a new crush.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.255
- What? I do not!
- [Frankie] Good.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.174
Because there's no
point trying to be happy.

02:47.257 --> 02:49.093
Life will crush your dreams
and destroy your spirit.

02:49.176 --> 02:52.179
Oh, right, 'cause you got
dumped by Winston this summer.

02:53.055 --> 02:55.766
And forget about it. She's
right. You have no chance.

02:55.850 --> 02:56.976
What? Why not?

02:57.059 --> 02:59.812
I mean, I don't want a chance, but... why?

03:00.813 --> 03:02.690
Because Tiny likes butts, and...

03:02.773 --> 03:04.316
you have the butt of a four-year-old boy.

03:04.399 --> 03:06.694
Ew! And how do you even know that?

03:06.777 --> 03:10.072
[sighs] He only likes
photos that feature butts.

03:10.155 --> 03:11.741
All the celebs he tweets
about have dope butts.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.618
It's butts, butts, butts with that guy.

03:13.701 --> 03:15.035
Stop saying "butts."

03:15.119 --> 03:18.080
It's really no surprise,
Shay. Butts are the new boobs.

03:18.163 --> 03:19.373
Finally.

03:23.210 --> 03:24.211
[sighs]

03:25.545 --> 03:26.964
Okay.

03:27.047 --> 03:29.925
Have you seen our schedules?
We only have one class together.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.927
- What's the point of school, even?
- [sighs]

03:33.303 --> 03:35.430
Did you idiots seriously
get caught making out?

03:35.514 --> 03:38.142
Oh, God, day one and I'm already notorious.

03:44.189 --> 03:45.775
Oh, I should... get this.

03:47.317 --> 03:49.361
- It's The Trap Door.
- [Zig exhales]

03:49.444 --> 03:50.655
That club downtown?

03:51.571 --> 03:54.074

- Hello?

03:54.158 --> 03:55.534
Yes, this is she.

03:56.326 --> 03:59.204
Um, yes, I would be very interested.

03:59.830 --> 04:00.998
Okay.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.335
Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye.

He wants me and my band to audition.

04:08.255 --> 04:10.215
- Really? Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

04:10.299 --> 04:13.093
Um, but you've been laying
your tracks by yourself.

04:13.177 --> 04:14.845
You don't have a band.

04:14.929 --> 04:17.096
Which means I have serious work to do.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.391
[sighs] Bye.

04:24.855 --> 04:27.024
So why are we in student council?

04:27.107 --> 04:29.735
Oh, Zoë Rivas, my dearest of friends,

04:29.819 --> 04:32.362
I've decided to share my
talents with the world.

04:32.446 --> 04:35.407
I'm running for president and
you're gonna be my campaign manager.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.284
I'm gonna win and all of this will be mine.

04:37.367 --> 04:41.288
So your persona for the new
school year is power hungry maniac?

04:41.371 --> 04:43.999
Okay, maybe it's lame, but I
actually think I'd be awesome.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.292
I'd make this a place

04:45.375 --> 04:48.087
where people don't feel like they
have to hide their true selves.

04:51.799 --> 04:54.051
What the crap is Miles doing here?

04:54.134 --> 04:55.678
[Simpson] Okay, welcome back, everyone.

04:55.761 --> 04:58.263
So, if you're here, you're running
for student council president.

04:58.347 --> 05:00.808
Or you're someone's
kick-ass campaign manager.

05:00.891 --> 05:02.642
Winston, language.

05:02.727 --> 05:04.353
All right, candidates, please sign in,

05:04.436 --> 05:05.938
and we'll go over the
campaign rules in a moment.

05:06.021 --> 05:08.774
[softly] I thought he was
going to boarding school.

05:08.858 --> 05:09.984

05:10.067 --> 05:12.111
- So, you're my competition?
- [sighs]

05:14.446 --> 05:16.699
- Important text?
- Miles, I didn't see you there.

05:16.782 --> 05:17.950
[chuckles softly]

05:18.033 --> 05:20.410
- May the best man win?
- Wouldn't want it any other way.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.496
[Simpson] Okay, all
right, you all must abide

05:22.579 --> 05:25.165
by the strict campaign
spending rules, right?

05:25.249 --> 05:26.291
Yes, Goldi.

05:26.375 --> 05:29.128
Uh, would you like us to submit
the budget as paper or PDF?

05:29.211 --> 05:30.545
[Simpson] That's a good
question. As part of our...

05:30.629 --> 05:32.757
You okay running against your ex?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.968
I'll let you know when my heart
stops trying to beat out of my chest.

06:17.927 --> 06:19.594
Big Battle of the Bands
coming up or something?

06:19.678 --> 06:22.472
No. Actually, I have an
audition for The Trap Door.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.099
[scoffs] That's huge.

maybe some more vocals,
and a heavy lead guitar.

Her boyfriend.

06:36.195 --> 06:38.155
Jonah is auditioning to play guitar.

06:39.448 --> 06:42.159
But, uh, I... I thought I'd play guitar.

06:42.242 --> 06:44.286
- You did?
- Well, yeah.

06:44.369 --> 06:45.830
Since when do you play guitar?

06:45.913 --> 06:47.414
[Zig scoffs]

06:47.497 --> 06:48.623
Since forever.

06:49.624 --> 06:52.669
Okay, well, why don't you just let me
know when you've made your decision?

06:59.676 --> 07:01.636
Hi! Vote for Goldi, school president.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.223
Hey. Good morning. Vote for
Tristan, first gay president.

to take the presidency from me

and leave me a blubbering mess.

Well, don't let him.

07:23.117 --> 07:25.995
He might get the mainstream
kids, but you have a real message

an outsider can relate to.

07:42.887 --> 07:44.679
I do look like a four-year-old boy.

07:46.849 --> 07:49.393
I have zero butt, and you
don't see me freaking out.

07:49.476 --> 07:51.145
That's because you're white.

- I'm just saying, it's different.

07:54.023 --> 07:56.441

08:04.033 --> 08:05.868

Or maybe everything will turn out great.

I'll find you some space.

- See?

08:46.033 --> 08:47.910
But, um, no points on your slogan.

08:47.993 --> 08:49.703
It's basically the same as my brother's.

08:49.786 --> 08:51.871
[Winston] All right, let's bring it down.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.919

09:22.736 --> 09:23.820
What if Tiny saw it?

09:23.903 --> 09:25.489
He'll think you have a great butt.

09:26.281 --> 09:27.950
It was actually a pretty decent 'shop job.

09:35.124 --> 09:36.500
[Tiny] Hey.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.085
Um... [chuckles]

09:38.168 --> 09:40.920
I was wondering if, uh, you
wanted to be my lab partner?

09:42.339 --> 09:44.466
Of course. She loves lab partners.

09:44.549 --> 09:46.426
[Tiny chuckles] Awesome.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.887
Enjoy the party.

09:51.931 --> 09:54.143
He totally likes you. You
are so hashtag, blessed.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.727
I am so hashtag, screwed.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.396
He only asked me 'cause
he saw that dumb photo.

09:57.479 --> 09:59.648
- So?
- As soon as he sees me in real life,

09:59.731 --> 10:02.567
it will become obvious I
have zero junk in my trunk.

Well, you could always stay seated?

10:10.492 --> 10:12.661
Ah, my worthy opponent.

Can I talk to you, privately?

10:14.371 --> 10:15.705
Yeah, sure.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.920
[sighs] Oh!

10:25.299 --> 10:28.552
- [chuckles nervously]
- You haven't returned any of my texts.

Nope. Still alive. Just... busy.

10:34.016 --> 10:36.268
So... are we still friends?

10:36.351 --> 10:37.811
Don't be an idiot.

10:37.894 --> 10:39.188
I need you.

10:40.355 --> 10:41.606
See you in class? [chuckles]

10:41.690 --> 10:43.275
Yeah, I guess.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.613
How do I tell Zig that
Jonah's way better than him?

10:48.697 --> 10:50.449
First of all, don't say that.

10:50.532 --> 10:53.035
There's no way to avoid
hurting his feelings?

10:53.118 --> 10:55.454
You could put him in the band
even though he sucks, but...

10:55.537 --> 10:56.913
then you'd be one of those girls.

10:56.996 --> 10:59.791
- What girls?
- The ones who pretend they're less smart,

10:59.874 --> 11:02.961
or funny, or talented to
soothe the fragile male ego.

11:03.045 --> 11:04.296
Yeah, well, I would never do that.

11:04.379 --> 11:07.507
Exactly. What's more
important to you, Zig or music?

11:09.676 --> 11:12.512
- Rough.
- I love Zig. I do.

11:12.596 --> 11:14.181
But music is everything to me.

11:14.264 --> 11:16.141
And there's gotta be a way
that I can pursue my dream

11:16.225 --> 11:18.477
without losing Zig to dumb insecurity.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.106
You could find a way to stroke his ego.

11:22.189 --> 11:24.358
- Hmm?
- [both laugh]

11:24.441 --> 11:26.485
- [laughing]
- [chuckling] Stop!

11:29.738 --> 11:32.407
- Should've told me you liked it rough.
- You stole my slogan.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.576
I hadn't even seen yours
when I came up with mine.

11:34.659 --> 11:35.994
You're full of crap.

11:36.077 --> 11:38.247
Why are you even running? You hate school.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.540
I'm running because I'm tired of running.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.834
Are you stroking out?

11:42.917 --> 11:45.129
Listen, things got so
bad with my dad last year,

11:45.212 --> 11:46.463
I thought about boarding school.

11:46.546 --> 11:48.632
He's out of the house now, but
he's still in the city, so...

11:48.715 --> 11:51.760
So you thought you'd escape on
your magic carpet made of money.

11:53.762 --> 11:56.973
Then I realized that the
real problem was I felt alone.

11:57.056 --> 11:58.933
So you're running to make friends?

11:59.017 --> 12:00.059
I'm running because...

12:00.144 --> 12:02.562
I want Degrassi to have
something for everyone.

12:04.648 --> 12:05.982
Hey, it's better than your reason.

12:06.650 --> 12:07.859
[scoffs] Which is?

12:07.942 --> 12:09.486
You're not over me...

12:10.529 --> 12:12.113
and you're just looking for a distraction.

12:12.197 --> 12:14.283
You've never been more wrong.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.034
[chuckles] That's too bad...

12:17.076 --> 12:18.912
'cause I'm not over you.

12:34.261 --> 12:36.221
Hey! Sorry I missed our prep session.

12:36.305 --> 12:38.014
It took me forever to find
the perfect debate outfit.

12:38.097 --> 12:40.141
And that's what you settled on?

12:40.225 --> 12:42.143
Miles told me I looked
hot in this last year.

12:42.227 --> 12:44.646
And since when do you care what he thinks?

12:44.729 --> 12:47.106
Since we totally made out at the party.

12:47.191 --> 12:48.817
[gasps]

12:48.900 --> 12:51.736
Zo, it was incredible.

12:51.820 --> 12:54.281
We connected on this,
like, deep, emotional level

12:54.364 --> 12:57.075
and all the feelings came flooding back.

12:57.158 --> 13:00.161
Well, find a lifeboat, because
you have a debate to prep for.

13:00.245 --> 13:01.413
Maybe I'll throw it.

13:02.456 --> 13:05.166
[scoffs] Because of one kiss?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.544
Okay, well, no matter how bad I do,

13:07.627 --> 13:09.254
I'm still gonna beat
that boring Goldi girl.

13:09.338 --> 13:12.466
And if I come second, I get
to be Miles' vice president.

13:12.549 --> 13:14.218
I could be the Biden to his Obama.

13:14.301 --> 13:15.885
They aren't dating, you realize?

13:15.969 --> 13:17.136
And Miles would be a good president.

13:17.221 --> 13:19.473
He's doing it for the little guy,
to make sure people feel included.

13:19.556 --> 13:21.641
- That's why you're doing it, remember?
- [sighs]

13:21.725 --> 13:23.310
Miles is still Miles.

13:23.393 --> 13:25.437
Sneaky, underhanded, indecisive Miles.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.564
He's made out with everyone. Even me.

13:27.647 --> 13:29.107
- I really feel like he's changed.
- [sighs]

13:29.190 --> 13:30.984
[Miles] Yeah, so don't hesitate
to text with any questions

13:31.067 --> 13:33.695
about, um, my platform.

13:33.778 --> 13:35.572
Mmm-hmm. [giggles]

13:56.050 --> 13:57.594
What... I have class!

13:57.677 --> 13:59.178
Not like that, you don't.

13:59.263 --> 14:01.390
- What is going on with your weird butt?
- Is it that bad?

14:01.473 --> 14:03.141
Worse. What did you even use?

14:03.224 --> 14:05.143
Cotton batting. I found it
in my mom's sewing stuff.

14:05.226 --> 14:06.728
There are butt pads available for purchase.

14:06.811 --> 14:09.606
Not everyone has a trust fund.
I get, like, ten bucks a week.

14:09.689 --> 14:11.775
- What are you doing?
- Trying to make it look

14:11.858 --> 14:13.818
like you don't have cotton
batting in your pants.

14:16.613 --> 14:19.533
- Oh, no.
- [bell ringing]

14:20.909 --> 14:22.744
Try distracting him with cleavage?

14:34.631 --> 14:36.300
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:36.383 --> 14:39.218
- Should we get started on the experiment?
- Yeah.

14:39.303 --> 14:41.012
Uh, can you grab a graduated cylinder?

14:41.095 --> 14:42.264
On it.

14:51.189 --> 14:54.318
Thanks. Oh, and Shay, we
need a set of pipettes, too.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.528
[chuckles]

15:08.498 --> 15:10.959
- Oh, hey! Watch it!
- Was that bromine?

15:11.042 --> 15:12.126
Yeah.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.296
Shay, that stuff is corrosive.

15:14.379 --> 15:15.714
- You have...
- Whoa!

15:15.797 --> 15:16.881
You have to take your pants off.

15:16.965 --> 15:18.633
What? No. No, I can't!

15:18.717 --> 15:20.719
- Oh, my...
- [Tiny] Do you want chemical burns?

15:20.802 --> 15:23.305
- Take them off before it soaks through.
- Turn around!

15:23.388 --> 15:24.931
- You... What...
- Turn around!

15:27.141 --> 15:28.810
- [Shay whimpering]
- Oh, uh...

- [Ms. Badger chuckling nervously]

15:34.023 --> 15:36.275

15:36.360 --> 15:37.986

skills, but also community connections.

This is why I respectfully
ask for your vote.

15:50.915 --> 15:53.668

to lead the Degrassi student body?

Well, because I'm fun and empathetic.

16:09.893 --> 16:11.770
No, I just...

16:13.480 --> 16:15.982
wanted Miles to elaborate on his honesty.

There won't be any surprises with

They'll get it all right.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.531
Especially if they're
some cute niner, right?

16:22.614 --> 16:25.033
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb with me, Mr. Honesty.

16:25.116 --> 16:26.993
I saw you scribbling on that blonde.

16:27.076 --> 16:28.161

16:28.244 --> 16:29.328
- to the actual debate?
- [girl] Yeah!

16:29.413 --> 16:32.081
Good people of Degrassi,
do you deserve a president

16:32.165 --> 16:33.792
that wants to make this
a place for everyone?

16:33.875 --> 16:35.919
- Or one that can't keep it in his pants?
- [students murmuring]

16:36.002 --> 16:38.505
- Oh, Tristan, time's up.
- [Miles] This school deserves a president

16:38.588 --> 16:40.799
who can separate his personal
and professional lives.

16:40.882 --> 16:42.300
- Miles, enough!
- [Tristan] Decisive, my ass.

16:42.384 --> 16:44.260
You can't even decide if
you like boys or girls.

16:44.343 --> 16:46.179
[Simpson] Okay, I think we
got a little off track here.

16:46.262 --> 16:48.848

- [Goldi stuttering] I'm sorry,

16:48.932 --> 16:50.224

Great. So you're free.

all your awesome skills.

spend time with that Jonah dude?

17:20.630 --> 17:22.590

me off for this dumb music stuff.

stuff" is my dream, Zig.

Yes.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.822
Why can't you understand that?

17:45.905 --> 17:48.324
Because you never want to hang out anymore.

17:48.407 --> 17:49.408
Because I'm really busy.

21:29.921 --> 21:31.881
- a word?
- Okay.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.551
You here to give me
the council credit card?

21:37.721 --> 21:40.389
It's come to my attention that
you threw an election party.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.808
Yeah, so?

21:43.517 --> 21:45.603
The campaign spending limit was $100.

21:45.687 --> 21:49.065
The pictures show you spent at least
that much on food and drink alone.

21:50.191 --> 21:52.026
This is... total crap.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.236
[sighs]

21:54.195 --> 21:57.406
You broke the rules. I'm
afraid I have to disqualify you.

22:17.802 --> 22:19.262
You did this.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.807
You're pathetic.

22:22.891 --> 22:24.433
I'm not the one who cheated.

22:25.894 --> 22:27.603
Okay.

22:27.686 --> 22:29.773
Fine, you win. Congratulations.

22:29.856 --> 22:33.067
But enjoy it while it lasts,
because I'm going to destroy you.

22:35.779 --> 22:37.613
And, for the record...

22:38.865 --> 22:41.075
I wasn't over you.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.577
But I certainly am now.

22:45.454 --> 22:47.456
