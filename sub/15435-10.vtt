WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.500
Previously on "brothers & sisters".

00:01.569 --> 00:03.070
tommy's not making you work,is he?

00:03.150 --> 00:04.480
She's,uh,she's with me.

00:04.570 --> 00:06.770
Would you like to have a
glass of champagne with me?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.200
Why,I'd love to. Thank you.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.500
You slept with lena,tommy. I know.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.710
Tommy's a hypocrite and liar.

00:10.790 --> 00:12.100
Oh,you found out about lena.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.250
How do you know abou

00:13.270 --> 00:14.700
Na was sleeping with tommy.

00:14.780 --> 00:17.860
Graham has quite a reputation
for growing midsize companies.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.120
I really want to have a baby.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.390
Well, you really want
this, too, don't you?

00:21.490 --> 00:22.600
Yes.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.380
Daniel cole said that he could prove that robert
wasn't the hero that everybody thinks he is.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.950
This is quite an operation.

00:28.050 --> 00:30.350
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

00:30.370 --> 00:31.710
Maybe I'm not over jason,

00:31.820 --> 00:33.100
but I am getting there

00:33.120 --> 00:36.200
robert's campaign is about
to take a serious hit.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.300
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.440
Adamson's lead continues to
grow. over senator mccallister.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.460
hello?

00:43.720 --> 00:47.810
Um,,it's nora walker. Kitty's mother.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.020
Oh,hello. How are you?

00:49.060 --> 00:50.350
I'm fine.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.690
actually,I was looking for kitty,and she
doesn't seem to be answering her phone,

00:54.770 --> 00:59.990
and I found,uh,your number on this
contact sheet that she left here,so.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.910
so how are you?

01:01.990 --> 01:03.480
-me?
-Yeah.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.580
How is it being back on the
campaign trail full-time?

01:06.640 --> 01:07.970
Are you having fun?

01:08.070 --> 01:09.720
Fun is not exactly what I'd call it.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.390
No,of course not.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.030
did you know that adamson is
calling robert "senator mcwaffler"

01:16.110 --> 01:17.680
every time they put a
camera in front of his face?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.080
It is so damn unfair.

01:19.190 --> 01:21.220
Presidential politics and fairness.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.880
kind of like oil and water.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.870
excuse me,is there something urgent you.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.830
you want me to tell,uh,kitty?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.940
tell her,please,that.

01:32.010 --> 01:32.900
I miss her.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.280
Oh,yeah,you can tell her in person.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.330
We're gonna be in california tomorrow.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.300
We got a fund-raiser
downtown at the jonathan club.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.800
Really?

01:42.570 --> 01:46.740
I'm having a big family dinner on
saturday. Why don't you join us?

01:46.760 --> 01:48.850
Okay. That. that sounds great.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.070
There's gotta be a way
to stop the bleeding.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.210
nora,I gotta run.

01:52.310 --> 01:53.430
I hope you understand.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.290
Absolutely. I've gotta run,too.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.350
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.440
we'll just keep scheduling
television appearances

02:01.540 --> 02:03.830
and make sure that everybody
hears your side of the story.

02:03.940 --> 02:04.730
That's all we can do.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.030
I've already done "meet
the press," "this week,"

02:06.090 --> 02:08.740
and they still keep calling
me "senator mcwaffler.

02:08.850 --> 02:11.260
" We should have just stayed in
the honeymoon suite in hawaii.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.470
Sorry,guys,but the honeymoon's over.

02:13.590 --> 02:16.430
This campaign has been runnin'
on fumes for the past two weeks.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.940
The ground you staked out as a strong,

02:18.040 --> 02:21.460
decisive leader has been eroded
with this helicopter story.

02:21.540 --> 02:24.500
It's time for a hail mary.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.590
You want to save this campaign?

02:26.670 --> 02:29.830
We need a town hall
meeting,covered live.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.780
no script,no vetted questions.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.390
Are you crazy?

02:32.470 --> 02:33.910
No,no,no. That. that's insane.

02:33.910 --> 02:34.630
Who'd be the audience?

02:34.730 --> 02:37.970
Veterans. party affiliation irrelevant.

02:38.080 --> 02:41.740
So,um,when and where,exactly,are you
planning on tanking this campaign?

02:41.840 --> 02:42.890
There's a veterans group in L.A.

02:42.970 --> 02:45.040
That's been hounding us
for the last four weeks.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.380
You can't put robert in front
of a hostile audience and.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.050
and just let him shoot from the hip?

02:49.120 --> 02:52.040
Why not? If the voters don't think I can
handle the pressure,I gotta show 'em that I can.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.470
Oh,come on. Don't tell
me you're for this.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.020
I don't have a choice.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.680
No,robert,this is a big risk.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.390
It's. it's a huge risk.

02:57.390 --> 03:01.190
Either we face this head-on,or
we pack up and go home.

03:01.570 --> 03:02.500
Make it happen.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.230
Kitty,your mother called.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.350
She wants to have us for
dinner when we're in town.

03:07.870 --> 03:09.300
"Us"?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.620
Thks,bob.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.100
Kitty's coming home this weekend.

03:17.190 --> 03:18.300
God,mom!

03:18.380 --> 03:22.170
You know,it's kind of appropriate to
say hello when you walk into a room.

03:22.230 --> 03:26.060
Hello. So I invited kitty,robert
and isaac to a family dinner.

03:26.090 --> 03:27.250
The brothers are all ditching me.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.630
And why is it I never see my
children all together anymore,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.000
especially not tommy and justin?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.630
They're like superman and clark kent.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.020
Well,mom,the brothers are
pretty busy at the moment.

03:35.100 --> 03:39.120
Maybe this isn't the best time to
have a big,classic walker dinner party.

03:39.190 --> 03:42.030
What,is something going on
you're not telling me about?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.610
No. No,no,no,no.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.630
I'm just saying,why do
we all have to be there?

03:46.730 --> 03:48.340
What's the big deal?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.820
Oh,I don't know.

03:50.930 --> 03:55.500
Remember when you wanted to skateboard
in the driveway with bobby lampert,

03:55.580 --> 03:59.670
and you were too nervous to be alone with
him,so I pretended to clean out the garage?

03:59.750 --> 04:01.020
What are you saying,mother?

04:01.120 --> 04:04.440
You're too nervous to
have a playdate with isaac?

04:04.500 --> 04:07.000
No! No,you know,you. you're my family.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.620
I love you. I miss you.
I want you around me.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.720
I'M. I'm proud of you.
I want to show you off.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.730
Oh,my god,you are.

04:13.810 --> 04:16.700
-What?
-You are totally into him.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.720
"Into him"? What?
That's like high school.

04:18.730 --> 04:19.670
No,we're grown-ups.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.000
We've had some lovely
conversations at the wedding and.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.810
you've always had a
thing for republicans.

04:23.870 --> 04:27.070
You know what? He's not
a "republican" republican.

04:27.110 --> 04:30.150
He's a self-reliant,historically
sensitive,

04:30.250 --> 04:33.670
get-the-job-done-yourself
kind of republican.

04:33.770 --> 04:36.050
And he's interesting.
He's very interesting.

04:36.110 --> 04:36.950
He's a widower.

04:37.050 --> 04:41.120
He has five kids and six
grandkids,and I just want my family.

04:41.210 --> 04:44.000
all right. I'm into him.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.580
God. What,that makes me pathetic,right?

04:46.590 --> 04:47.760
No,mother!

04:47.860 --> 04:49.590
No,it makes you cute.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.430
-That's worse. I'd rather be pathetic.
-And human,and you have a crush.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.120
-I don't,no. All right.
-We will all be there with bells on.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.740
Okay? Thank you.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.190
-mom's hot for a republican.
-Sarah. Sarah,stop it.

05:04.350 --> 05:07.730
-Mom's hot for a republican.
-stop it!

05:12.820 --> 05:14.450
stop!

P coffee break.

05:25.660 --> 05:28.030
-Bad time?
-Yeah. No.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.580
A l
- little.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.860
Um,look at this. It's from jason.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.260
You're still e-mailing your ex?

05:34.350 --> 05:35.870
I e-mailed him once after the wedding.

05:35.980 --> 05:39.100
You know,a very standard
"I'm sorry we broke up,

05:39.190 --> 05:40.320
you know,I still care
about you" e-mail.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.870
He e-mails back a very
unstandard,"I'm coming home.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.410
" oh,my god.

05:44.490 --> 05:45.980
I know. He wants to have lunch.

05:46.010 --> 05:46.530
When?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.720
I don't know. He's being so vague.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.820
-You gonna tell scotty?
-Why would I do that?

05:50.830 --> 05:51.480
-You should.
-He.

05:51.510 --> 05:54.400
he almost broke up with me after the wedding
'cause he's afraid I'm still into jason.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.340
Well,are you?

05:55.440 --> 05:56.820
Who made you my conscience?

05:56.910 --> 05:57.740
What,are you jiminy cricket?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.510
Well,you know,maybe
you need a conscience.

06:00.630 --> 06:03.670
Well,all the men in this family could do
with a little cricket on their shoulder.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.550
What do you mean,"all the men"?

06:05.740 --> 06:06.820
-Nothing.
-Which men?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.710
Justin? Tommy? Saul? Who?

06:08.740 --> 06:10.750
I don't know anything.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.170
-Do you?
-No.

06:13.180 --> 06:14.870
-Maybe.
-Maybe what?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.780
-tommy had an affair.
-With lena.

06:20.870 --> 06:22.000
-You knew?
-For weeks.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.360
-Who told you?
-Rebecca. And you?

06:23.710 --> 06:24.740
Uh,saul figured it out.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.140
Can you believe tommy?

06:26.240 --> 06:27.590
Well,after julia left him,yeah.

06:27.670 --> 06:28.720
What? You're defending him?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.520
Okay,we're so not arguing about this.

06:30.630 --> 06:31.440
Fine. You're right.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.990
about us not arguing,not
about tommy being justified.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.810
-Okay,fine,I'll drop it.
-Good.

06:36.910 --> 06:40.490
The thing is that mom knows something's
going on between justin and tommy.

06:40.590 --> 06:42.060
They're acting all
weird with each other,

06:42.140 --> 06:45.780
and now she's got this big dinner this
saturday,and she wants us all there.

06:45.960 --> 06:46.800
Can you talk to them?

06:46.910 --> 06:50.270
Just tell them all they've gotta
do is turn up,eat and act normal.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.580
No! Why do I have to be involved?

06:51.590 --> 06:53.160
Because I'm not supposed
to know anything,

06:53.260 --> 06:55.880
and I've done a miraculous
job at keeping my mouth shut.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.590
Please will you talk to them?

06:58.670 --> 06:59.720
-Yeah,I'll talk to them.
-Thank you.

06:59.730 --> 07:01.150
But what. oh,come on! What. "normal"?

07:01.180 --> 07:03.090
What am I,a miracle worker?

07:03.120 --> 07:04.690
Wow,five times.

07:04.810 --> 07:07.950
Yep,my mom's be married five times.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.310
Too bad she makes a sucky wife.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.210
but yeah,now she's just
living with some guy,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.110
you know,hoping that he'll propose.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.000
Sounds like a country-western song.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.050
Yeah,well,what do you
call it when you're,

07:21.130 --> 07:23.550
uh,sleeping with your
brother's mistress?

07:23.760 --> 07:25.860
Ex-mistress.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.380
And I would say this,you
know,it's like,uh.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.300
r&b,like a little rhythm
and blues,you know?

07:32.380 --> 07:34.310
Yeah,it's the blues
part I'm worried about.

07:34.390 --> 07:36.280
What's wrong? You're not enjoying this?

07:36.570 --> 07:38.060
Yeah.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.150
but.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.540
I just feel weird sometimes.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.750
Don't you?

07:45.830 --> 07:47.070
No.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.170
I don't. I don't care
what you were with tommy.

07:50.190 --> 07:51.880
I mean that.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.410
I mean,you know,he. he was.

07:53.420 --> 07:56.250
he was the one that was
married. He made the mistake.

07:57.550 --> 08:00.250
Then why is it that we're telling
everybody that we broke up?

08:00.360 --> 08:03.980
Not that I,you know,want
anybody to find out or anything,

08:04.060 --> 08:06.190
but seriously,what.

08:06.970 --> 08:09.050
what are we doing?

08:10.130 --> 08:14.140
We're having fun,you know?
I mean,it's just us here.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.660
And it's easy,and it's
uncomplicated,and yeah,you know,lena,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.320
the second you open
that door,it gets messy.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.490
But you know what?

08:20.650 --> 08:23.960
I-I like what we have here. Don't you?

08:26.370 --> 08:28.020
Yeah.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.780
Yeah.

08:29.870 --> 08:31.620
As long as we keep the doors locked.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.380
I'll dead bolt the
thing,for god sakes. Just.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.640
you know,there were boats and
ships and smoke and snow and blood,

08:40.730 --> 08:42.610
and your mother comes
riding in on a horse.

08:42.770 --> 08:46.150
pretty scary. anyway,but she
breaks the sword over her knee.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.010
wait. What was she wearing?

08:47.030 --> 08:47.930
A viking dress,you know?

08:48.050 --> 08:48.770
No! Yeah.

08:48.840 --> 08:53.200
No,no. So then she takes half the
sword,and she hands it to her comrade,

08:53.290 --> 08:56.530
and she goes off to fight
the saxons or the angles.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.730
we were fighting the jutes from jutland.

08:58.930 --> 08:59.570
Mom. Hey.

08:59.570 --> 09:03.240
And I designed the viking dress myself.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.640
what are you doing here?

09:06.770 --> 09:08.450
I really liked seeing
you a couple weeks ago.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.000
I thought maybe you were gonna call me.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.710
Wait,mom,how have I
never seen this movie?

09:11.800 --> 09:14.120
It sounds like the most
amazing kitschfest ever.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.410
Oh,no,it was kitsch. I'll give you that.

09:16.420 --> 09:19.220
Yeah,well,it was queens,new
york,for europe in the middle ages.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.600
What do you expect?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.360
You remember you wore
that costume to studio 54?

09:23.480 --> 09:27.150
Wait. My mother went to
studio 54 in a viking dress?

09:27.210 --> 09:28.770
The dress was the only reason we got in.

09:28.890 --> 09:30.680
Mom,I'm so embarrassed
for you right now.

09:30.820 --> 09:36.220
You know,I like swapping war stories
as much as any other viking warrior,

09:36.460 --> 09:39.270
but I have work to do.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.860
It was very nice meeting you,rebecca.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.390
Wait. We're just. we're
just gettin' warmed up.

09:45.450 --> 09:46.350
Bye,david.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.300
Next time you come by,I want to see that
movie. I want to see it really badly.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.280
Okay.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.390
she's wonderful.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.380
Bye.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.730
-Do you want to fill me in?
-No.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.560
I don't know how I'm gonna stand
up in front of a bunch of veterans

10:08.650 --> 10:11.680
and try to explain something I'm
not sure I can explain to myself.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.710
Oh,honey,you know
what? You just have to.

10:14.190 --> 10:17.530
you just have to be honest.
You just have to tell the truth.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.050
And you know what?

10:20.150 --> 10:22.960
I think that sometime before
we die,I'd really like to have.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.010
-have sex?
-Yes.

10:24.040 --> 10:24.980
Yeah,that'd be great.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.400
'Cause I really want to start trying.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.620
-New positions?
-No,having a baby.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.250
Yeah,I'm sorry. I've
just been so exhausted.

10:35.330 --> 10:41.350
It's okay,but just remember that politics
isn't our only time-sensitive issue.

10:42.130 --> 10:43.680
Oh,we got. we gotta go.
We can't talk right now.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.750
We gotta get that plane.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.700
Kitty?

10:48.870 --> 10:51.090
I love you.

10:52.910 --> 10:55.410
Well,I love you,too.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.020
Come on,go,go.

11:02.790 --> 11:06.130
Uh,not that I don't love
thumbing through gay porn.

11:06.210 --> 11:07.950
I'm sorry,male clothing catalog.

11:08.050 --> 11:09.060
but what am i doing here,bro?

11:09.150 --> 11:11.610
Be nice or I'll put
you on the mailing list.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.710
Don't tell me that's scotty.
You didn't give him a key?

11:14.790 --> 11:16.670
Wow,you really have commitment issues.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.190
What was so important it.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.790
oh,no way. Nice try. This is ridiculous.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.810
No. you know what? I'm out of here.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.420
Yeah. Okay,okay,okay.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.390
Why don't the two of you just
think of me as your attorney,

11:25.460 --> 11:28.900
and let me mediate a little temporary truce
between the two of you,for both your sakes.

11:28.980 --> 11:29.510
I don't trust him.

11:29.620 --> 11:30.540
You know what? Screw you,bro.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.910
okay,the thing is,it's so simple.

11:33.010 --> 11:35.390
Mom's really into this guy isaac,okay?

11:35.490 --> 11:37.600
And she thinks,as a family,we'll
make a good impression.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.950
deluded,I know.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.430
but if she wants us to go over to the house
and have dinner,that's what we have to do.

11:42.530 --> 11:46.780
Yowant to know why? She is inches away
from the truth about you two and lena.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.170
It's like chum in the water for her.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.360
She can smell the
blood,and she's circling.

11:50.470 --> 11:52.140
You're working on your marriage,right?

11:52.220 --> 11:53.320
-Yeah.
-Great.

11:53.390 --> 11:55.610
Your relationship with
lena,it's over,right?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.540
-Yeah.
-Okay,great.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.390
Then it's all in the past.

11:59.470 --> 12:02.480
Mom need never know how much of a
disappointment you both actually are,

12:02.550 --> 12:03.830
unless that's what you want.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.060
-I'll go.
-Good.

12:05.870 --> 12:06.620
Yeah,whatever.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.110
Perfect. Case dismissed.

12:14.750 --> 12:15.950
ladi and gentlemen.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.300
senator robert mccallister.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.970
thank you.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.400
Um,I see there's already a line at the
microphone,so why don't we just begin? Hello.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.410
Private first class john jimpson,sir.

12:30.490 --> 12:32.800
I just rotated back from
iraq a couple months ago.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.190
-Welcome home.
-Thank you,sir.

12:34.190 --> 12:36.240
I've read a description
of what happened that day.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.000
All due respect,you were prepared to
abandon those men on the ground. Am I right?

12:41.340 --> 12:42.460
I know there's been
a lot of speculation.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.620
-how's he doing?
-On what happened,but I stand by.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.570
He's not off to a very good start.

12:46.650 --> 12:48.340
-I had to make a choice.
-just be patient.

12:48.370 --> 12:51.890
Between saving my men on the
helicopter or those men on the ground,

12:51.970 --> 12:58.110
and at that moment,the only thing that I knew for
certain was I could save my guys in the chopper.

12:59.230 --> 13:06.580
senator,what I'm wondering is,why didn't you
admit the truth before the logs were released?

13:06.660 --> 13:09.900
Why did you claim credit for a
rescue you didn't want to attempt?

13:09.980 --> 13:12.400
Well,first of all,I
didn't take credit for it.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.880
But you're absolutely right,my
silence accomplished the same thing.

13:16.990 --> 13:22.000
The truth is,I didn't know how to
explain to the world and more importantly,

13:22.070 --> 13:23.110
the families of the men who died.

13:23.190 --> 13:24.780
I'm nervous. I'm so excited.

13:24.830 --> 13:29.080
I haven't been this excited since laura
stuno and I won the freshman future C.E.O.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.610
Club regional mock investment trophy.

13:31.690 --> 13:34.320
That sounds fun. So,uh,what did
you do to celebrate that triumph?

13:34.350 --> 13:39.620
Oh,god. We went to the cyclone bar
and grill,where we got horribly drunk,

13:39.650 --> 13:42.240
and I think I ended up dancing.
uh,you don't want to hear that story.

13:42.290 --> 13:43.160
I kinda do,actually.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.470
-No,you don't,promise.
-Yeah.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.340
-I can't go there.
-Okay.

13:47.370 --> 13:49.500
Well,then that means you and
I can have dinner then,huh?

13:49.590 --> 13:51.490
You mean a working dinner?

13:55.610 --> 13:57.400
well,I mean,you gotta eat.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.850
Indeed I do,but I'm more than
capable of eating by myself.

14:00.920 --> 14:04.090
Yeah,well,that's so
boring,don't you think?

14:05.490 --> 14:06.880
-Can I ask you something?
-Shoot.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.670
What's the longest relationship
you've ever been in?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.640
Okay. I have no idea
where this is going.

14:12.830 --> 14:13.570
Uh,six years.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.720
Did you ever cheat? Don't lie.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.120
-Uh,no.
-No?

14:17.220 --> 14:18.480
Well,I mean.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.080
Of course,technically speaking,depends
on how you define cheating.

14:21.310 --> 14:27.510
See,is it too much to ask that when two people
commit to each other that nobody ever strays?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.670
Shouldn't we love and respect
our husbands,wives,whatever,

14:31.770 --> 14:34.650
enough that we would want to
spare them from that kind of hurt?

14:34.730 --> 14:36.660
That'd be really nice.

14:36.820 --> 14:41.610
Of course,our kind and considerate
natures don't always win out,do they?

14:44.120 --> 14:48.010
So,uh,what about you?

14:48.350 --> 14:50.810
You ever cheat? Ever?

14:51.310 --> 14:52.490
-Me?
-Yeah.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.620
Cheat?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.040
No. No,never.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.740
Never in ten years of
marriage did I ever.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.360
what?

15:01.710 --> 15:04.000
Why are you laughing? I didn'T.

15:04.080 --> 15:09.150
Uh,you say no,but,uh,I think there's
something you're not telling me.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.460
It's okay. You know why?

15:11.470 --> 15:13.200
Because I'm gonna start
playing hard to get.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.680
So as much as you may want
to,I'm not havin' dinner with you.

15:19.810 --> 15:22.930
andn those seconds,I remember
arguing with my copilot.

15:23.030 --> 15:24.480
we shouldn't have done this.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.750
I remember the R.P.G.Hitting
and us starting to go down.

15:28.850 --> 15:33.720
And when I regained consciousness,my
copilot was dead in the seat next to me.

15:34.930 --> 15:37.000
Some of you have been there.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.810
and it is just.

15:42.410 --> 15:44.620
unimaginable.

15:44.730 --> 15:46.530
In that moment,I didn't think.

15:46.640 --> 15:51.250
I didn't regret or mourn
or weigh my options.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.970
I did what any one of
you would have done.

15:53.050 --> 15:55.310
I tried to save my men.

15:55.390 --> 15:58.070
And I didn't think
what I did was heroic.

15:58.550 --> 16:01.760
And after the war,I
just wanted to forget.

16:02.030 --> 16:06.290
And then ironically,by not
talking,I was called a hero,

16:06.370 --> 16:09.400
a distinction that I never asked for.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.920
my name's brad.

16:14.380 --> 16:14.940
Yes?

16:15.040 --> 16:21.600
Bottom line is you froze,and the world is too dangerous a
place for us to elect a president who freezes under pressure.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.930
Fair enough.

16:24.740 --> 16:26.470
I froze.

16:26.970 --> 16:29.190
for 23 seconds.

16:30.150 --> 16:32.270
I was 25 years old.

16:33.150 --> 16:35.910
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.910
I believe that I am ready
to lead this country.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.120
War tests our humanity.

16:42.200 --> 16:48.830
And sometimes we don't have the luxury of choosing
between good and bad,only between bad and worse.

16:48.910 --> 16:56.690
That's war,and we need to support the men and women
who are making those kind of decisions every day.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.890
you're a genius.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.569
Hey,your boy's not so bad,either.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.770
hey,mom.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.440
Hey.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.960
Would you bring back a
couple of bottles of wine?

17:14.030 --> 17:15.730
I want to cook you dinner.

17:15.810 --> 17:18.230
What's the occasio

17:18.300 --> 17:21.790
I invited david over
for dinner tomorrow.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.530
mom,since I've been home,all
you do is work,and you seem.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.109
lonely.

17:28.210 --> 17:32.520
It's true. And you're the one that's always
telling me to go out and meet friends and all that.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.550
I am not lonely.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.590
And david.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.090
my history with him is complicated.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.760
Mom,everything with you is
complicated. Why draw the line now?

17:43.800 --> 17:45.370
Oh,becca,give it a rest.

17:45.450 --> 17:47.700
Well,so what,is he a serial killer?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.950
-Were you guys grifters?
-I wish.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.060
Mom,there is so much you never told me.

17:54.110 --> 17:57.170
I like hearing about your past. So
what's the worst that could happen?

17:57.330 --> 18:01.620
He comes over,I get to hear more embarrassing
stories about your wild youth,and I'll cook.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.810
Okay,okay,fine. I will
bring down some cabernet.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.550
You know,I am happy to
tell you about my past.

18:07.630 --> 18:13.250
But my relationship with
david. there is no future.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.090
You got favorable
response,for the most part.

18:17.170 --> 18:17.750
For the mostart?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.900
Well,what you said played
great in the hall,and,

18:19.960 --> 18:22.420
uh,you got an internal bump in our
polls,but not the bump we'd hoped for.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.770
Ll it hold? I don't know. At
least we're not taking on water.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.950
Hey,adamson's live on tv.

18:27.030 --> 18:30.310
I just don't buy the senator's
reluctant hero shtick.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.840
The only thing he's reluctant
to do is tell the truth.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.620
It's time to change the
story on the front page.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.370
Isaac,I know where
you're headed with this.

18:36.430 --> 18:39.220
-Okay,then we start writing your
concession speech. -It's off-limits.

18:39.570 --> 18:40.980
Guys,can we have the
room for a minute,please?

18:41.070 --> 18:42.350
All right,what's going on?

18:42.430 --> 18:44.300
Governor adamson has a son.

18:44.410 --> 18:46.000
and three daughters and a wife.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.610
And I have an uncle named bob.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.500
What are we talking about here?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.000
Adson has a developmentally
disabled son.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.510
He's been in a private treatment facility since
birth and adamson has never publicly recognized him.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.400
How long have you guys
been sitting on this?

18:59.480 --> 19:03.590
That's guy's record for special education and
persons with disabilities is. it's atrocious.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.240
-Kitty.
-it's the height of hypocrisy.

19:05.260 --> 19:06.930
I know,I know,but I am
not gonna use his kids.

19:07.030 --> 19:10.890
Okay,well,what about the kids who
aren't getting the services they need?

19:11.010 --> 19:12.870
Isaac,would you.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.590
like to weigh in here?

19:14.680 --> 19:18.010
What kitty is saying is
that this is personal for me.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.240
I have a special needs
son,and in my opinion,

19:21.310 --> 19:27.330
adamson has done a disservice to
his own son and to his constituency.

19:27.380 --> 19:32.520
Adamson's campaign is hitting you
hard,and they're telling lies about you.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.220
A-at least the information
that we have is true.

19:35.300 --> 19:39.970
I appreciate all of your opinions,but I've told
you a million times,I will not win playing dirty.

19:40.050 --> 19:42.340
The answer's no.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.240
I can't believe I have
to go to this tonight.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.810
How could tommy be so stupid?

19:46.900 --> 19:48.680
Oh,please,let's not judge.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.200
I mean,we're accidentally
living together.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.800
If jason were to come home
tomorrow,I'd be back in my ranchero.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.730
Why. why would you think jason's coming.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.150
why would you be back in your ranchero?

19:58.230 --> 19:59.980
I was kidding.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.930
Come on,cut your brother
some slack. No one's perfect.

20:02.970 --> 20:06.470
Well,you know,trying to be the perfect
family for some republican operative

20:06.530 --> 20:08.630
my mom has the hots for is
making me a little nervous.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.290
You keep saying he's a republican. I'm far
more impressed she might be dating a black man.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.560
A black republican. only my mom.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.610
You know what? Let's
just blow this thing off.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.640
Really,I've. I've got
a ton of paperwork.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.650
Maybe you should delegate more.

20:20.730 --> 20:22.100
What about lena?

20:22.180 --> 20:23.610
She'S. busy enough.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.280
Well,you can work on it tomorrow.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.870
We promised your mom,and we
already paid the babysitter.

20:28.970 --> 20:29.560
I know.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.760
Something going on between you and
justin? Is that why you don't want to go?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.560
He never calls.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.520
Come on,I'm not blind.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.220
Why don't you just tell me what it is?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.560
Look,he said.

20:41.660 --> 20:44.620
some things when we were there at his
detox,and I'm just sick of his crap.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.950
He needs to grow up.

20:46.020 --> 20:48.790
Well,he's not gonna grow
up between now and dinner.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.960
Let's just go and try
to have a good time.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.620
Yeah. try.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.580
oh,dear.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.380
Don't stir the rice.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.410
Mom said it won't toast at
the bottom if you stir it.

21:07.490 --> 21:08.750
Mom wants to toast the rice?

21:08.840 --> 21:10.680
Yes. Apparently it's the
most important part of paella.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.640
So I'm gonna take the
spoon. No stirring?

21:12.710 --> 21:13.710
Okay.

21:13.790 --> 21:14.700
But. but when is she coming down?

21:14.800 --> 21:18.300
Because this doesn't smell right,and I
don't want to get blamed for toasty rice.

21:18.380 --> 21:20.660
I don't know. She's putting her dress on,and
she's doing her hair or something like that.

21:20.710 --> 21:21.660
What's burning?

21:21.740 --> 21:23.600
The rice. Do you know
anything about paella?

21:23.660 --> 21:26.670
No. All I know is the rain in
spain stays mainly in the plain.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.000
Sarah,sarah,no stirring!
Sarah,put the spoon down.

21:29.090 --> 21:29.830
Kevin.

21:29.910 --> 21:31.170
I give up. Fine.

21:31.210 --> 21:32.990
Okay. It's mom's dinner anyway.

21:32.990 --> 21:35.380
Ooh,I'm gonna do garlic bread.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.790
Where's scotty?

21:36.880 --> 21:37.690
He had to work.

21:37.770 --> 21:39.860
You guys,like,never see each other.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.690
You're not in a relationship,right?

21:41.770 --> 21:43.440
-No.
-So don't criticize people who are.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.130
Kevin,I'm sorry. I was just
trying to feel your pain.

21:45.210 --> 21:46.190
I'm not criticizing you.

21:46.270 --> 21:48.390
I'm st a little stressed
right now,okay? I'm sorry.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.430
A little dark.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.160
hi,guys.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.410
-Hi!
-hey!

21:54.490 --> 21:55.270
Hey,justin.

21:55.350 --> 21:57.120
Hey,how are you? How are you doing?

21:57.200 --> 21:59.890
Good,good. Right,tommy?

21:59.970 --> 22:01.550
Uh,yeah,we're great.

22:01.630 --> 22:02.610
Hi. how are you?

22:02.640 --> 22:03.150
where's mom?

22:03.250 --> 22:05.970
She's upstairs getting ready for isaac.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.140
I can't believe we have to
actually be here for her dates now.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.140
She chaperoned your
senior prom,so be nice.

22:10.190 --> 22:12.180
Hello,everybody.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.160
hi,how did it go?

22:14.240 --> 22:15.190
Oh,you know,it was exhausting.

22:15.270 --> 22:17.080
-How are the polls?
-Oh,they're not so good.

22:17.150 --> 22:18.880
Not so good. But we're not giving up.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.050
But I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. Don't mind him.

22:21.130 --> 22:21.750
He's,um.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.570
what,running for president?

22:23.590 --> 22:25.800
Hello,hello,hello,hello.

22:25.810 --> 22:27.600
mom,wow.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.160
oh,come on now. Come on.

22:30.190 --> 22:32.960
Robert,get off the phone. I
don't care who you're talking to.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.870
oh,there's the rice. oh!

22:35.180 --> 22:36.800
-There's isaac.
-I'll get it.

22:36.830 --> 22:40.250
No,you get the rice,and I'll
get the door,and,everyone,listen,

22:40.360 --> 22:44.340
I would really appreciate it if you
would be on your best behavior tonight.

22:44.850 --> 22:45.810
You understand?

22:45.890 --> 22:48.470
So I. I'm. I'm gonna get the door.

22:54.220 --> 22:57.340

23:31.710 --> 23:34.660
Veterans today was sooving
and so extraordinarily honest.

23:34.750 --> 23:37.140
I know a lot of people appreciated it.

23:37.220 --> 23:38.610
I know I did. Thanks,bro.

23:38.630 --> 23:40.210
Thank you. Thank you very much.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.620
And let's hope that adamson
guy will leave you alone.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.080
I appreciate the support,but I don't
think he's gonna leave me alone.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.810
Yeah,well,the truth is we
could totally shut him up,

23:46.890 --> 23:49.400
but we're not allowed to play
by the same rules that he does.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.450
What's that supposed to mean?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.810
It means nothing. Kitty,we're not.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.180
do you have something on adamson?

23:53.240 --> 23:54.850
come on,you can tell us. Okay.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.370
Hey,kitty,robert's right.

23:57.450 --> 23:59.720
All right,well,I'm not gonna
tell them anything specific,

23:59.800 --> 24:03.540
but hypothetically,say you
know the truth about something,

24:03.620 --> 24:07.330
but by saying it,you could
potentially seriously hurt someone.

24:07.390 --> 24:09.770
Would you do it?

24:13.460 --> 24:15.420
I knew it. Adamson's gay.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.950
no. No,he is not gay.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.420
Not all republicans are gay.

24:19.660 --> 24:23.480
You know,personally,I don't think the truth
is worth knowing if someone's gonna get hurt.

24:23.540 --> 24:24.050
Why not?

24:24.130 --> 24:25.640
I just don't see what you accomplish.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.740
Well,I wouldn't gossip about
it,but if I was the person

24:29.160 --> 24:32.000
who was doing something
that was hurting someone,

24:32.080 --> 24:34.710
I'd hope that I'd be big enough
to tell them the truth myself.

24:34.790 --> 24:36.820
Really? 'Cause I'm
with julia on this one.

24:36.820 --> 24:38.830
Why cause pain if you don't have to?

24:38.910 --> 24:44.230
Because if you don't face the truth,tommy,you
don't move forward,you don't grow.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.540
I mean,take my marriage for example.

24:46.590 --> 24:50.700
Yeah,your marriage,exactly. Had you not found
out about that one kiss between joe and rebecca,

24:50.740 --> 24:51.950
you'd still be in your marriage.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.500
-Yeah,but then it would be a lie.
-exactly.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.580
And now you sound like dad.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.780
Would you shut up,all
right? I'm not dad.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.750
I never was. I never will be. Just stop.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.230
No,he's always going
on with this dad thG.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.370
Okay,family! Family!

25:02.580 --> 25:06.250
I really don't think isaac
wants to hear all of this.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.010
so let's just stick to politics.

25:09.070 --> 25:14.180
Please,nora,this is a million times more fun
than politics,and I'm not even following it.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.990
well,unfortunately,the business
that we are in is politics.

25:18.070 --> 25:19.780
We are in the business of politics.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.360
So if you have an opportunity
to win,you should take it.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.920
I mean,obviously,personal
relatiohips. you shouldn't lie.

25:25.930 --> 25:28.920
I don't lie to robert. Robert
doesn't lie to me,right?

25:29.780 --> 25:31.220
no.

25:31.420 --> 25:35.620
I mean,unless I absolutely
have to. I'm kidding.

25:35.650 --> 25:38.770
look,I mean,obviously,you
can have your convenient,

25:38.850 --> 25:40.440
you know,misunderstandings,but.

25:40.500 --> 25:41.970
w-w-what are you
trying to say,robert?

25:42.050 --> 25:42.870
Nothing,nothing.

25:42.940 --> 25:45.020
We never lie to each
other. That is a no-brainer.

25:45.070 --> 25:50.680
-I thought we were having a philosophical,theoretical discussion about a campaign that had information.
-we were.We changed the subject.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.070
I'm gonna go get some more wine,and
maybe you would like to help me,robert?

25:57.740 --> 25:59.530
Is everything all right?

25:59.610 --> 26:01.580
I'm gonna go help with the wine.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.450
if you have something to
tell me,just. just say it.

26:06.450 --> 26:10.810
I mean,I-I stopped our wedding in the middle
of the vows just so as not to tell you a lie.

26:10.890 --> 26:12.160
And if you have something
to say to me,please just.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.340
just say it. Okay,a lie.

26:13.650 --> 26:16.950
if two people aren't exactly on the
same page,does that make it a lie?

26:17.030 --> 26:18.640
Well,yes,if you're not
telling me what it is.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.980
What if I was too scared to talk ab?

26:20.060 --> 26:22.200
T it you have never been
scared of anything in your life.

26:22.260 --> 26:25.280
All right,for example,what if.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.860
what?

26:27.250 --> 26:29.840
Not having a baby now.

26:32.010 --> 26:33.120
What?

26:33.220 --> 26:35.170
Are you telling me that you
don't want to have children?

26:35.270 --> 26:40.360
No,no. I'm. I'm just saying that clearly,we
are not coming at it at exactly the same. way.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.200
You've got to be kidding me.

26:42.290 --> 26:43.450
I mean,you knew that I wanted children.

26:43.530 --> 26:45.700
-That was. that was plainly on the table.
-Okay,but the timing is less than perfect.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.580
I barely have enough time to parent
the children that I already have.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.670
and I'm just saying it's
something that we should discuss.

26:50.770 --> 26:52.100
we have discussed it,robert.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.030
-I don't have time to discuss it.
-I get it.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.520
time is of the essence. I
have to get down to business.

26:56.550 --> 26:57.740
what are you guys whispering about?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.810
We're not whispering. We're
just having a conversation.

26:59.870 --> 27:00.430
It's nothing.

27:00.510 --> 27:02.590
no,no,it's not nothing.
It's not nothing.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.260
Robert doesn't want have children.

27:04.330 --> 27:06.700
Wow. A little late for
that kind of information.

27:07.620 --> 27:10.870
Since we're being honest here,does your
boyfriend know that my brother's coming back,

27:10.950 --> 27:12.940
and you guys are having lunch?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.210
That's none of your business.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.420
what is going on in here?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.570
Sarah,guess what? Robert
doesn't want to have children.

27:17.620 --> 27:19.260
I never said that! I said.

27:19.980 --> 27:22.530
-Keep your voice down.
-That I am ambivalent about the timing.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.600
And that's different. Not
to me,but I'm a lawyer.

27:24.650 --> 27:25.830
I'm with him.

27:26.090 --> 27:28.280
guys,what's going on? Mom's freaking o.

27:28.330 --> 27:29.660
We're supposed to be impressing isaac.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.590
You know what? I don't
need to impress isaac.

27:31.590 --> 27:34.180
No,the thing is
that,kitty,that mom likes him.

27:34.260 --> 27:35.570
like really likes him.

27:35.630 --> 27:37.490
-Mom has a crush on isaac?
-That's gross.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.170
Yeah,she does,and if he
breaks her heart,I'll sue him.

27:39.250 --> 27:40.320
Him? What about you?

27:40.410 --> 27:42.100
You're about to drag my brother.

27:42.130 --> 27:44.950
-Back into your psycho-
melodramatic-romantic. -"psycho-melodramatic"?

27:45.200 --> 27:46.040
I don't know what. Jason's
coming back from malaysia?

27:46.050 --> 27:47.720
He's already having a date with him!

27:47.760 --> 27:49.160
It's not a date,okay?

27:49.210 --> 27:50.960
We agreed to meet for lunch
so we can talk. You know what?

27:50.960 --> 27:53.820
I'm allowed to. I'm single. I
can change my mind if I want to.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.590
not that I would,okay?
So get off my case.

27:55.600 --> 27:56.660
I'm not the one who's married.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.540
what does that mean?

27:57.590 --> 27:58.660
what is that supposed to mean?

27:58.720 --> 28:00.710
Kevin.

28:01.000 --> 28:01.780
Nothing.

28:01.860 --> 28:03.260
Come on,we can't keep it to ourselves.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.380
No! What?

28:04.390 --> 28:05.270
shut up! no what?

28:05.480 --> 28:07.070
-No,no,sarah!
-what?

28:07.100 --> 28:10.070
Tommy had an affair. with lena.

28:10.240 --> 28:10.920
Who's lena?

28:11.000 --> 28:11.550
Oh,my god. When?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.280
Right up until julia came back.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.310
-God,does julia know?
-no!

28:15.350 --> 28:16.930
You know,I never liked that girl lena.

28:17.010 --> 28:17.580
What did lena do?

28:17.650 --> 28:19.110
No,she's a home wrecker.
She's just like holly.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.720
Don't blame her. If you're gonna blame
anyone blame tommy and dad,all right?

28:21.770 --> 28:23.460
They had families at home,not lena.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.640
Oh,come on,that is the most
confused moral reasoning,

28:25.690 --> 28:28.840
and your opinion doesn't count
because you slept with lena,too.

28:28.850 --> 28:30.360
I'm still sleeping with her,okay?

28:30.460 --> 28:32.200
So I'd appreciate it if
we could stop bashing her.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
You said you dumped her.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.890
So your family must
just ss you terribly.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.530
Especially max,my. my lab.

28:38.590 --> 28:42.330
He's staying at my sister's,you
know,until bob becomes president.

28:42.610 --> 28:43.240
Labs. I love.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.100
we had a lab,didn't we,tommy?

28:46.190 --> 28:47.830
-Yeah. bingo.
-Yeah,bingo.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.880
You know what they say in washington.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.140
if you want a friend,get a dog.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.490
that'S.

28:55.770 --> 28:58.600
where is everyone? This is ridiculous.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.680
Yeah,I'm gonna go check.

28:59.710 --> 29:02.820
Thank you. Tell 'em we're having dinner
in here. They might want to join us.

29:02.870 --> 29:03.450
I'll go with him.

29:03.530 --> 29:05.710
No! Julia,sit. No.

29:05.780 --> 29:07.670
So max is a lab.

29:07.710 --> 29:08.840
Is he republican,too?

29:08.920 --> 29:14.400
No,he depends totally on me,which
obviously makes him a democrat.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.320
well,how long are you here for?

29:16.410 --> 29:17.840
Uh,for a year.

29:17.880 --> 29:21.050
I traded my loft in soho for
this beach bungalow in venice.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.360
You have a loft now?

29:22.440 --> 29:23.850
Yes,I do.

29:23.930 --> 29:24.880
Wow,I'm impressed.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.200
When your mom and I
made the viking epic.

29:27.280 --> 29:27.830
oh,my god.

29:27.910 --> 29:30.890
We stayed in this little,tiny
apartment in brooklyn.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.040
Please tell me you brought a copy.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.200
oh,come.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.220
-if you have A.
-I'll kill you.

29:35.220 --> 29:37.310
-If you have a beta.
-What?

29:37.780 --> 29:40.070
Thank god you didn't transfer it to dvd.

29:40.180 --> 29:40.690
I want to see it.

29:40.770 --> 29:43.820
You know what? It's a little bit like
pulling out the junior high yearbook.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.870
it sounds like a great idea
until you actually see it.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.970
All right,fine. I'll drop it.

29:50.030 --> 29:52.330
So how long were you guys together?

29:52.390 --> 29:55.080
-Um,we were.
-it was on again,off again.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.400
mostly off.

29:57.550 --> 29:59.120
And when was the last
time you saw each other?

29:59.200 --> 30:00.850
Becca,this is not 20 questions.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.870
Mom,I'm just asking.
I just want to know.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.210
I don't remember.

30:05.730 --> 30:07.840
were we with perry?

30:08.860 --> 30:12.480
it can be sweeter no.
It was new year's eve.

30:15.300 --> 30:17.130
We had just wrapped "asylum.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.160
" Mom,tell me that you didn't
star in a slasher flick.

30:19.230 --> 30:21.950
No,I did not star in it.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.620
I was victim number four.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.830
Oh,god.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.460
then why did. why did you break up?

30:30.010 --> 30:32.260
god,that was a long time
ago. I can't remember.

30:32.340 --> 30:35.150
We were busy and lost touch.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.710
That's when you met william.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.350
Right.

30:43.470 --> 30:44.720
That's my fathe oh.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.870
This conversation is
beginning to age me.

30:46.950 --> 30:50.150
Could we just talk about
something else,please?

30:51.710 --> 30:54.410
This pasta is delicious.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.030
Mom wanted us to be this
mythical family tonight.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.660
I invited justin and tommy
'cause she was getting suspicious.

30:59.730 --> 31:02.210
Don't talk about me like I'm
not. I'm right next to you.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.050
Yeah,so am I.

31:04.130 --> 31:05.920
Suspicious of what?

31:06.020 --> 31:07.920
You know what,tommy? I don't
even know what to say to you.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.530
Then don't say anything,kitty,all right?

31:09.610 --> 31:13.460
I am trying to save my marriage.
Lena was a mistake. I know.

31:13.770 --> 31:15.340
tommy?

31:18.900 --> 31:21.450
Why was lena a mistake?

31:22.940 --> 31:24.730
what is it? Tell me.

31:25.540 --> 31:27.410
Not here,honey.

31:27.490 --> 31:29.920
We should. we should go.

31:31.190 --> 31:34.190
are you all deliberately
trying to embarrass me?

31:34.270 --> 31:36.920
We're sitting out
there all by ourselves!

31:37.000 --> 31:40.320
come. come on. Please,please,all of
you,just march back in there right now.

31:40.380 --> 31:41.910
-Come on.
-M-m-mom,something came up.

31:41.960 --> 31:42.520
We. we have to go.

31:42.560 --> 31:43.510
No,no,no,no.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.880
You're not going anywhere
unless your house is on fire.

31:45.980 --> 31:47.670
No,it's fine. I don't need to go.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.630
Come on,nora,let's go back to the table.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.940
let's go back to the table. Come on.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.480
I really do love dogs.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.820
The only reason we never
got another one after bingo.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.810
bingo was his name.

32:05.540 --> 32:07.570
bingo was his name.

32:07.670 --> 32:09.950
well. he was hit by a car.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.550
oh,I'm soorry.

32:10.630 --> 32:13.770
Yes. And so we just. we
just never got another one.

32:14.930 --> 32:15.950
julia?

32:16.060 --> 32:19.840
Oh,sweetheart,are you. oh,I
didn't mean to upset you.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.720
Bingo really has been
gone a very long time.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.910
It's not about bingo,nora.

32:23.990 --> 32:25.450
Um,honey,we should. we should go.

32:25.470 --> 32:26.380
No. No.

32:26.420 --> 32:27.640
Julia,are you all right?

32:27.720 --> 32:29.120
It's not just that you slept with lena.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.610
-Julia.
-who. who slept with lena?

32:30.670 --> 32:31.620
You don't want to know,mom.

32:31.710 --> 32:32.640
-Tommy?
-What?

32:32.650 --> 32:33.490
I should have seen it coming.

32:33.570 --> 32:35.700
I can't believe we're having this
conversation. You can't just sit there and cry.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.720
Yell at him or hit him. I'll
come over there and hit him.

32:37.740 --> 32:38.820
-I can'T.
-yes,you can.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.370
I can'T.

32:40.930 --> 32:42.760
I did it,too. I slept with someone.

32:42.770 --> 32:43.470
You what?

32:43.470 --> 32:44.800
You slept with someone else,too?

32:44.850 --> 32:46.010
I'm sorry. We should go.

32:46.020 --> 32:47.590
What is the matter with you two?

32:47.660 --> 32:49.440
You know,maybe we should
just clear the table and.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.900
no,don't clear the table!
Just put the dishes down.

32:51.980 --> 32:54.500
Just put the dishes
down and go,all right?

32:54.580 --> 32:57.600
Thank you for coming.
The dinner is over.

33:11.330 --> 33:15.000
dinner wasn't as bad as
I thought it was gonna be.

33:15.070 --> 33:16.720
That's good.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.770
I'm not horrible. It's a compliment.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.610
Well,what do you expect?

33:20.690 --> 33:24.090
My memory of you isn't
exactly a pretty picture.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.840
Well,I'm a lot older and wiser now.

33:27.960 --> 33:31.040
I haven't done coke for a
long time. That probably helps.

33:31.850 --> 33:34.380
Good-bye,david.

33:35.160 --> 33:40.980
Okay. You're gonna have to explain to rebecca
why I left before she got back with the ice cream.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.410
Why. why am I leaving? I forgot.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.710
Because I'm kicking you out.

33:46.180 --> 33:48.790
I don't trust yo david.

33:48.910 --> 33:54.010
You still haven't told me why you suddenly
showed up at my house and my place of business.

33:54.090 --> 33:55.860
I moved back to L. A. ,And.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.230
and being here,I-I.

33:59.310 --> 34:04.960
I think about you and what we had,which
is something that I haven't had since and.

34:05.430 --> 34:07.700
-you're not buying any of this,are you?
-No.

34:08.790 --> 34:13.870
Okay,I'm leaving,even though
I love mint chocolate chip.

34:16.340 --> 34:19.250
oh,so lonely the next
move is yours,holly.

34:27.610 --> 34:30.330
That I still care you know,you
don't have to stay. I'm fine.

34:30.370 --> 34:32.880
I'm not here to take care of you.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.719
I'm actually enjoying the company.

34:37.870 --> 34:39.760
oh,god,I don't know.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.900
It must be something
in the water or e wine.

34:41.980 --> 34:45.679
I cannot get my family together
without the roof blowing off.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.570
It's a lot better than how I grew up.

34:47.650 --> 34:51.389
My father taught us
to keep our trap shut.

34:51.500 --> 34:53.540
Nobody spoke in our house,you know?

34:53.620 --> 34:55.060
So consider yourself lucky.

34:55.139 --> 35:00.550
It's loud here,but it's the
truth,and the truth sets you free.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.360
Yeah.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.420
Oh,tommy!

35:07.170 --> 35:11.860
I-I always thought he had a lot of
his father in him,but the good part.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.850
-Nora,c-can I
be honest? -Yes.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.720
-From one parent to the other?
-Yes.

35:15.770 --> 35:18.440
Children test us. We know that.

35:18.930 --> 35:21.580
But that. that doesn't mean
we stop believing in them.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.140
It simply means that
we have to fight harder.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.220
Parenting is so hard.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.750
You're preaching to the choir.

35:30.830 --> 35:32.710
-Amen.
-amen.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.330
-One more thing.
-Yes?

35:35.380 --> 35:41.560
Next time I'm in town,can we
go to dinner,just the two of us?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.920
Yes.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.860
I guess I should have asked
you that in the first place.

35:47.930 --> 35:50.840
It would have saved us
a whole lot of trouble.

35:54.210 --> 35:55.440
jesse.

35:55.540 --> 35:57.960
That was his name.

35:58.150 --> 35:59.710
We went out.

35:59.810 --> 36:04.620
we went out in high school,and I
ran into him when I was in phoenix.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.330
We went out to dinner.

36:06.410 --> 36:10.410
We drank too much,and it was just.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.250
so easy.

36:13.730 --> 36:16.430
But it was a mistake.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.620
Was she,was lena a mistake?

36:20.690 --> 36:23.110
Yeah,she was.

36:24.060 --> 36:26.010
so.

36:27.630 --> 36:31.080
is it too late? I mean,what do we do?

36:40.100 --> 36:41.620
Morning.

36:41.770 --> 36:43.700
Anything good going on?

36:45.540 --> 36:49.490
Oh,I love it when it gets
cold in L.A. I slept so well.

36:49.530 --> 36:52.310
Well,I'm glad someone slept well.

36:59.870 --> 37:02.050
I had fun last night.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.970
I like david mom,there'S.

37:20.620 --> 37:25.590
no way that.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.790
I mean,he couldn'T.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.810
Oh,god,no.

37:32.310 --> 37:36.120
No,rebecca,no.

37:36.410 --> 37:38.110
Are you sure? Because,mom,I.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.950
all my life,you told me my
dad was a struggling director.

37:42.030 --> 37:45.330
Sweetie,because I was
protecting william.

37:45.410 --> 37:49.740
I mean,those were just the
kind of guys that I dated then.

37:49.790 --> 37:55.770
Oh,sweetie,I am so
sorry that I lied to you.

37:56.780 --> 38:02.560
William walker was your father.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.270
-Hello.
-it's sunday.

38:11.310 --> 38:13.240
I'm a workaholic mother.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.410
whose kids are with their
dad. What's your excuse?

38:15.420 --> 38:17.910
Well,it's monday morning in shanghai,and
I've been talking to our contacts.

38:18.020 --> 38:18.700
I'm impressed.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.080
And I,uh,packed my own lunch.

38:21.160 --> 38:21.970
How's that for impressive?

38:22.070 --> 38:23.700
I'm a mother of two.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.910
Not so much.

38:27.860 --> 38:30.080
Oh,sorry.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.510
-Big night?
-***

38:31.540 --> 38:34.060
My mother cooked paella.

38:34.140 --> 38:36.150
My family ploded.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.080
How about you?

38:38.180 --> 38:42.450
Well,I channel surfed
till I fell asleep.

38:42.550 --> 38:47.720
I woke up at 3:00 A.M. To an infomercial promising to cut
the time it takes to peel an apple down to mere seconds.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.410
I want one of those.

38:49.540 --> 38:51.360
and one of these.

38:51.390 --> 38:54.560
It's,uh,turkey. On wheat.

38:54.910 --> 38:57.500
And,uh,homemade vegetable soup.

38:57.580 --> 39:00.050
So no pressure.

39:00.270 --> 39:02.450
If you're hungry,eat up.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.260
What?

39:09.450 --> 39:11.320
It's not a date.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.990
Who said it was?

39:18.420 --> 39:19.660
Hi.

39:19.740 --> 39:21.930
Yeah,are you busy?

39:22.470 --> 39:23.240
No,no,no,no. Look,I.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.670
there's just something I want to say.

39:25.770 --> 39:31.980
This really is no big deal,and I certainly
don't want it to become a big deal.

39:34.340 --> 39:35.780
no,no,no,no,it's not that.

39:35.880 --> 39:39.330

39:58.170 --> 39:59.250

Oh,my,my.

40:09.610 --> 40:12.110
You are so beautiful.

40:12.190 --> 40:14.350
I know. She is.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.380
Whatever you decide to do,you
don't have to do it for her,

40:17.490 --> 40:21.830
but you do owe her the very best life
you can give her,however that works out.

40:21.930 --> 40:23.260
I know. We,uh.

40:24.450 --> 40:26.840

We want to stay together.

40:29.030 --> 40:31.670
Yes. We're glad to hear that.

40:32.190 --> 40:35.680
tommy,listen,you didn't
lie to julia for a decade.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.500
You made a mistake.

40:37.580 --> 40:40.140
You're not your father.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.180
Thank you.

40:43.980 --> 40:45.270
Hey,you.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.170
Let's go sit outside,shall we?

40:47.250 --> 40:48.170
Yeah,she'll love that.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.550
Come on,dad.

40:49.630 --> 40:52.160
The state police claim to
have found yet another link.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.600

40:53.680 --> 40:54.860
No.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.540
-He is in iowa,right?
-Yes.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.790
He did not sleep with your mother,if
that's what you're thinking.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.540
No,I.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.860
was not suggesting that isaac and my.

41:06.980 --> 41:08.650

41:08.660 --> 41:11.520
I-I was just wanting to
talk to him,that's all.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.530
Hey,kitty.

41:14.780 --> 41:22.520
I just want you to know that I understand how important
kids are to you and that time is not on our side.

41:22.590 --> 41:24.570
-A spokesperson announced
earlier today. -you know,I-I.

41:25.220 --> 41:29.620
I just really want us to be able to
be honest with each other,that's all.

41:30.780 --> 41:37.320
-I-I also,you know,I-I don't want it to be off the
table either. okay? -Where governor clay adamson.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.350
Wait a minute. What. what is this?

41:43.420 --> 41:48.070
my family and I take full responsibility for our
decision to conceal the truth from our friends,

41:48.150 --> 41:52.010
colleagues and from the american public.

41:52.090 --> 41:57.110
My wife and I did what we believed was
best for our family,including our son aaron.

41:57.190 --> 41:59.400
please tell me that we didn't
have anything to do with this.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.620
No. No,of course not.

42:02.780 --> 42:06.780
In light of this,and after
consultation with my family and staff,

42:06.900 --> 42:11.710
I am withdrawing my candidacy
for president immediately.

42:11.790 --> 42:16.520
You just became the front-runner
for the republican nomination.

42:16.930 --> 42:19.040
I know.
