WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.703
OH, I LOVE MY BLUMFY.

00:02.703 --> 00:06.377
IT'S HALF BLANKET AND ALL COMFY.
IT'S MY BLUMFY.

00:06.377 --> 00:09.580
JULES, I HAVE BEEN CHOSEN
BY THE GROUP TO TALK TO YOU.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.385
YOU LOOK INSANE. IT'S TIME
TO TAKE THAT THING OFF.

00:14.385 --> 00:16.547
(chuckles)
I AM NEVER TAKING THIS OFF,

00:16.547 --> 00:19.190
AND BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME,
TOUCH IT. HMM?

00:19.190 --> 00:21.752
I DARE YOU.
I DARE ALL OF YOU.

00:23.254 --> 00:25.526
(all) OOH.

00:25.526 --> 00:30.661
YOU'RE SAYING THAT DEEP DOWN
EVERY GUY IS A LITTLE BIT GAY?

00:30.661 --> 00:34.135
IT'S SCIENCE. TO PROVE IT,
YOU JUST HAVE TO SET A GAY TRAP.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.138
A WHAT?
HEY, ANDY, WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT BETTE MIDLER SONG

00:37.138 --> 00:40.211
THAT SHE SINGS IN "BEACHES"?
"WIND BENEATH MY WINGS."

00:40.211 --> 00:42.213
A GAY TRAP.
YOU'RE A LITTLE GAY.

00:42.213 --> 00:43.574
(laughs)
(laughs)

00:43.574 --> 00:46.647
BUT I KNOW HOW TO TURN IT OFF
WHEN IT COUNTS, RIGHT, BABE?

00:46.647 --> 00:51.252
SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES IN BED
HE CALLS ME "CHAMP."
ONE OF MY BEST GUY FRIENDS,
NEIL GOLDMAN,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.754
TAUGHT ME ABOUT GAY TRAPS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:53.754 --> 00:58.058
I ALWAYS HAD
A LOT OF GUY FRIENDS.
NO, YOU ALWAYS HAD
A LOT OF GUYS HANGING AROUND,

00:58.058 --> 01:00.631
HOPING THEY'D EVENTUALLY
GET A CHANCE TO NAIL YOU.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.633
GUYS AREN'T REALLY FRIENDS
WITH GIRLS.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.136
THAT IS SUCH A CLICHГ©.

01:05.136 --> 01:08.139
RIGHT, BECAUSE CLICHГ©S ABOUT MEN
AND WOMEN AREN'T BASED IN TRUTH.

01:08.139 --> 01:09.470
GREAT POINT, CHAMP!

01:09.470 --> 01:12.303
THAT WAS A BAD MOMENT
FOR ME.

01:12.303 --> 01:16.447
WELL, I HAVE TONS
OF GUY FRIENDS.
SEE?

01:16.447 --> 01:20.651
HAVE YOU SLEPT
WITH ANY OF THEM?
YEAH, I'VE SLEPT WITH ALL
OF THEM, BUT ONLY AS FRIENDS.

01:20.651 --> 01:23.114
JULES, TINY EYES IS RIGHT.
I HAVE TINY EYES?

01:23.114 --> 01:25.556
WHEN ANDY AND I FIRST MET,

01:25.556 --> 01:28.389
WE WERE IN THE SAME CIRCLE
OF FRIENDS, BUT BASICALLY

01:28.389 --> 01:32.663
IT WAS JUST A DOINK CHAIN
THAT I WORKED MY WAY AROUND.
AND GUESS
WHO SHE GOT TO LAST? OW.

01:32.663 --> 01:34.165
I DON'T HAVE TINY EYES.

01:34.165 --> 01:36.167
YOU DO, BROTHER.
YOU'RE LIKE A FERRET.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.868
(sighs)

01:37.868 --> 01:41.132
DID YOU GUYS JOIN A CULT?
FEEL IT.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.506
YOU'RE ALL WRONG.
LAST NIGHT ON THE NEWS,

01:45.506 --> 01:48.509
THERE WAS A BEAR AND KITTEN,
AND THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.482
IF THEY CAN DO IT,
SO CAN MEN AND WOMEN.
MM-HMM.
HOW'D THAT STORY END?

01:51.482 --> 01:53.284
THE BEAR KILLED THE KITTEN...

01:53.284 --> 01:56.347
AFTER GETTING TOO FRISKY
WITH IT. ALL RIGHT.
OHH.

01:58.149 --> 01:59.450
COOL T-SHIRT.

01:59.450 --> 02:01.722
THAT'S ALMOST PURPLE.
WHAT COLOR DO YOU CALL THAT?

02:01.722 --> 02:04.595
FUCHSIA.
GAY TRAP!
YOU'RE A LITTLE GAY. (chuckles)

02:04.595 --> 02:07.228
SO UNCOOL
TO GAY TRAP YOUR OWN SON.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.230
AW, IT'S JUST A GAME.
COME ON.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.732
IT'S LIKE THAT ONE WHERE YOU
ACT OUT MOVIE TITLES...
CHARADES?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.564
DOUBLE GAY TRAP! (laughs)

02:13.564 --> 02:17.168
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF THIS GAME,
BUT IT IS BETTER THAN HAND FART.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.909
IS IT?
(chokes) GOOD... GOD.

02:18.909 --> 02:21.412
SO MY BUDDY CARL BAILED
ON OUR FISHING TRIP TO GEORGIA.

02:21.412 --> 02:23.814
DO YOU WANNA COME?
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ANDY?

02:23.814 --> 02:26.247
NAW, ANDY CAN'T GO.
YOU KNOW, HE'S BUSY

02:26.247 --> 02:29.180
WITH WORK AND THE BABY
AND WHATNOT, SO...

02:29.180 --> 02:31.582
HEY, HE NEVER ANSWERED ME.
HE ANSWERED
WITHOUT ANSWERING.

02:31.582 --> 02:34.225
WELL,
THAT'S JUST CONFUSING.
I'LL GO FISHING WITH YOU.

02:34.225 --> 02:35.556
(laughs)
OH, I DON'T KNOW, TRAV.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.189
YOU KNOW,
WE'LL BE SLEEPING OUTSIDE

02:38.189 --> 02:40.531
AND BRUSHING OUR TEETH
WITH PINECONES.

02:40.531 --> 02:44.335
IT'S KIND OF A MAN TRIP.
WELL, I AM INSULTED,
BUT WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT.

02:44.335 --> 02:48.199
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BRING
A TOOTHBRUSH?
SAME REASON WHY I'M NOT BRINGING
MY CHOLESTEROL MEDICINE.

02:48.199 --> 02:50.671
(chuckles) I'M ON VACATION.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.172
MORNING, INTRUDERS.
MM.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.174
WHERE'S ELLIE?
SHE'S STILL IN BED.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.408
SHE TOOK ONE OF
HER SLEEPING PILLS LAST NIGHT,

02:57.408 --> 02:59.410
BUT SHE HATES LOSING CONTROL,
SO SHE ALWAYS FIGHTS IT.

02:59.410 --> 03:02.683
FOR GOD SAKE,
JUST GO TO SLEEP.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.316
YOU GO TO SLEEP.
I'M NOT TIRED.

03:05.316 --> 03:07.818
SOMETIMES SHE GETS HORNY,
AND WE HIT IT...

03:07.818 --> 03:11.562
BUT IT FEELS WRONG,
'CAUSE SHE NEVER REMEMBERS IT.

03:11.562 --> 03:12.893
(sighs loudly)

03:12.893 --> 03:14.925
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S UP?

03:14.925 --> 03:17.768
NOT BEING ABLE TO GO FISHING
WITH BOBBY MADE ME REALIZE

03:17.768 --> 03:20.631
THAT I'M ALWAYS EITHER AT WORK
OR WITH THE FAMILY.

03:20.631 --> 03:24.605
I NEVER HAVE ANY TIME
FOR JUST ME.
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TWEET
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.807
SERIOUSLY,
LOOK AT MY FACE.

03:26.807 --> 03:30.411
YOU SEE HOW I CAN'T HIDE
HOW BORED I AM BY YOUR PROBLEMS?
TOTALLY.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.913
YEAH, OKAY,
WELL, WHEN YOU TWEET IT,

03:32.913 --> 03:35.916
IT GOES OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE
TO ALL THESE FACELESS PEOPLE,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.949
AND YOU CAN PRETEND THAT THEY'RE
HANGING ON YOUR EVERY WORD.
WELL, THAT'S DEEP.
YOU SHOULD TWEET THAT.

03:38.949 --> 03:41.522
(keys click)
"WAY AHEAD OF YOU,
I TOLD HIM."

03:41.522 --> 03:43.954
YOU JUST NEED
TO SHAKE THINGS UP A BIT.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.957
YOU KNOW, WHEN I GET INTO A RUT,
I WHIP OUT MY NAUGHTY UNDERWEAR.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.660
IT MAKES ME FEEL SEXY...
UNTIL ABOUT 4:00,

03:49.660 --> 03:53.304
WHEN I REALIZE
NO ONE'S EVER GONNA SEE IT.
THE ONLY TIME I HAVE FOR JUST ME
IS MY DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.806
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SHAKE THAT UP?

03:55.806 --> 03:58.809
OH, GOD! THIS IS SO GOOD!
OHH! (laughs) OHH!

03:58.809 --> 04:01.772
SO THAT'S
ANDY'S ORGASM FACE? HMM.

04:01.772 --> 04:04.244
(chuckles) I CONVINCED ANDY
TO BUY LAURIE'S OLD MOTORCYCLE.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.977
OH, AND I ALMOST FORGOT,
YOU'RE A JERK.

04:06.977 --> 04:09.650
WHAT, ARE YOU STILL MAD

04:09.650 --> 04:12.953
ABOUT THE WHOLE GUYS AND GIRLS
BEING FRIENDS THING?
WELL, IT'S LIKE SAYING THAT
WEAREN'T EVEN REAL FRIENDS.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.955
I JUST MEANT THAT...

04:14.955 --> 04:17.958
MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T BE FRIENDS
WITHOUT A SEXUAL UNDERCURRENT.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.031
LOOK, WE FIND EACH OTHER
ATTRACTIVE.

04:21.031 --> 04:23.033
WE'RE FLIRTY.
THAT'S OUR DYNAMIC.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.035
(laughs) WE ARE SO NOT.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.768
BUT WE WOULD NEVER ACT
ON IT,

04:27.768 --> 04:30.270
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
IT WOULD END IN DISASTER,

04:30.270 --> 04:33.003
SO WE BECAME "FRIENDS."

04:33.003 --> 04:35.005
NO, WE BECAME "FRIENDS,"
BECAUSE--

04:35.005 --> 04:38.008
NO, WAIT. I DON'T WANT
TO USE THE AIR QUOTES.

04:38.008 --> 04:39.510
WE BECAME "FRIENDS"...

04:39.510 --> 04:41.011
OH, FORGET IT.

04:41.011 --> 04:43.854
HEY, JULES. DO YOU WANT ME
TO WATER YOUR FLOWERS?

04:43.854 --> 04:47.017
OH, HEY, TOM. (chuckles)
SEE? NICE FRIEND.

04:47.017 --> 04:50.761
OH, YEAH. HE DEFINITELY WANTS
TO WATER YOUR FLOWERS.

04:50.761 --> 04:53.764
(laughs) NO, AND GROSS!

04:55.065 --> 04:57.898
ARE THE FLOWERS MY FACE?

04:57.898 --> 05:01.071
HA HA! THAT WAS AMAZING!

05:01.071 --> 05:04.335
YOU THINK
YOU'RE READY TO GO SOLO?
WAIT ONE SECOND.

05:04.335 --> 05:07.338
(rock music playing)

05:14.385 --> 05:17.918
DID YOU GUYS IMAGINE ME
IN SLO-MO LIKE I ASKED?
(Jules and Laurie) WE DID.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.090
LET'S DO THIS!

05:20.090 --> 05:23.954
(engine revving, thud)

05:23.954 --> 05:26.427
I'LL BUY IT!

05:26.427 --> 05:29.430
HEY, DAD, YOU KNOW
I DON'T HAVE A FISHING POLE.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.432
YOU'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE,
RIGHT?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.434
POLES? (laughs)
WE DON'T NEED POLES.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.965
WE'RE NOODLING, BABY.

05:34.965 --> 05:37.468
HMM. DO I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

05:37.468 --> 05:40.471
NOODLING IS A SPECIAL KIND
OF REDNECK FISHING, MY FRIEND.

05:40.471 --> 05:43.614
SEE, YOU GO INTO A MUDDY LAKE,
AND YOU FIND A BIG HOLE

05:43.614 --> 05:45.616
WHERE A CATFISH IS
PROTECTING ITS EGGS,

05:45.616 --> 05:48.619
AND YOU CATCH IT BY GETTING IT
TO EAT THE NOODLE.

05:48.619 --> 05:50.381
SO WHAT'S THE NOODLE?

05:50.381 --> 05:52.082
YOUR ARM'S THE NOODLE.

05:52.082 --> 05:55.055
HOLY GODS! WHAT--
(laughs)

05:55.055 --> 05:58.088
(imitating motorcycle revving)
(door opens and closes)

05:58.088 --> 06:00.591
SOMEBODY LEFT A MOTORCYCLE
IN OUR DRIVEWAY.

06:00.591 --> 06:04.064
GO DRIVE OVER IT, AND THEN
FIND OUT WHO IT BELONGS TO.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.837
IT'S MY NEW HOG.
I BOUGHT IT FROM LAURIE.

06:06.837 --> 06:08.839
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
WITHOUT ASKING ME?

06:08.839 --> 06:10.771
I-I ASKED YOU LAST NIGHT.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.704
CAN I GET A MOTORCYCLE?
I LIKE TURTLES.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.546
YOU LOOK GOOD. GET NAKED.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.578
FINE.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.079
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.982
WHOSE STUPID IDEA WAS IT
TO BUY A MOTORCYCLE?

06:21.982 --> 06:23.984
(imitates bird calling)

06:23.984 --> 06:26.517
OKAY,
THAT'S THE ELLIE ALARM.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.560
COME ON, GUYS. QUICK!
TRAVIS, GO LOCK THE BACK DOOR.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.692
BOBBY, GET THE FRONT.
THIS IS NOT A DRILL!

06:31.692 --> 06:34.695
DO IT LIKE WE PRACTICED.
(sighs) AAH!
(horror film theme plays)

06:34.695 --> 06:37.728
WHAT? I THOUGHT
IT WAS FUNNIER WITH THE KNIFE.
(exhales deeply)

06:37.728 --> 06:42.673
в™Єв™Є

06:49.009 --> 06:51.882
SO WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION
TO GIVE ANDY PERMISSION

06:51.882 --> 06:54.545
TO BUY A MOTORCYCLE?
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT
HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUMFY,

06:54.545 --> 06:57.788
AND HE LOOKED SO SAD.
I'LL ONLY RIDE IT TO WORK.

06:57.788 --> 07:00.751
ONLY TO WORK, ELLIE.
AND I'LL WALK IT THROUGH
ALL THE INTERSECTIONS,

07:00.751 --> 07:03.654
'CAUSE I'M NOT GREAT
AT TURNING YET.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT DOCTORS CALL
PEOPLE WHO DRIVE MOTORCYCLES?

07:03.654 --> 07:04.955
MODERN DAY COWBOYS?
SEXY REBELS?

07:04.955 --> 07:08.459
POPULAR?
ORGAN DONORS.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.461
JULES,
I'M ABOUT TO BEHAVE CHILDISHLY.

07:10.461 --> 07:14.134
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D TURN AROUND.
NO PROBLEM.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.166
(whines)

07:16.166 --> 07:19.109
AH,
PREPARE TO BE PROVEN WRONG.

07:19.109 --> 07:20.711
SOUNDS FUN. ABOUT WHAT?
(cell phone beeping)

07:20.711 --> 07:22.843
WE'RE SEARCHING THROUGH
JULES'S OLD GUY FRIENDS,

07:22.843 --> 07:25.516
TRYING TO FIND ONE WHO DIDN'T
WANT TO SLEEP WITH HER.
OH, HI, GIL. THIS IS--

07:25.516 --> 07:27.017
YEAH, JULES. (laughs)

07:27.017 --> 07:29.520
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU RECOGNIZED MY VOICE.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.182
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU
SINCE JUNIOR HIGH.

07:32.182 --> 07:35.185
OH,
YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME. SWEET.

07:35.185 --> 07:38.188
HOW? LIKE, IN THE PAPER
OR ONLINE?

07:38.188 --> 07:40.631
OH, JUST REGULAR FOLLOWING.

07:40.631 --> 07:42.162
WELL, BYE, GIL.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.635
(chuckles)
WHAT A KOOK, HUH?

07:44.635 --> 07:46.637
NO GLOATING.
STATUS REPORT, LAURIE?

07:46.637 --> 07:48.799
UH...
YOUR FRIEND BOB--

07:48.799 --> 07:51.972
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE IN THE WHEELCHAIR?
OH, WHEELCHAIR BOB, YEAH.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.144
HE JUST E-MAILED US BACK.
(types)

07:54.144 --> 07:57.177
HE SAYS, "REMEMBER
BEER HOCKEY. L.O.L."

07:57.177 --> 08:00.711
(laughs) HE'S SUCH A GOOF.
(laughs) HE SOUNDS LIKE
SUCH A GOOF.

08:00.711 --> 08:03.013
HE ALSO SAID
THAT YOU SHOULD CALL HIM,

08:03.013 --> 08:05.716
BECAUSE HE'S REGAINED FEELING
DOWN THERE.
OH, SHOOT!

08:05.716 --> 08:09.720
(chuckles)
I MEAN, GOOD NEWS FOR BOB,
BUT... SHOOT!

08:09.720 --> 08:12.663
(insects buzzing,
duck quacking in distance)

08:15.766 --> 08:18.068
HOW GREAT IS THIS?
SO GREAT.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.970
LET'S NOODLE.

08:19.970 --> 08:23.173
SO FIRST THINGS FIRST--
WE GOTTA FIND A GOOD HOLE.
DEFINE "GOOD HOLE."

08:23.173 --> 08:26.937
DEFINE "GOOD HOLE"
IN REGARDS TO NOODLING.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.139
IT'S A HOLE
WITH A CATFISH IN IT.

08:29.139 --> 08:32.142
ALLS YOU GOTTA DO IS JUST SHOVE
YOUR ARM DOWN IN THERE.

08:32.142 --> 08:33.984
IS THERE ANY SKILL IN THIS?
I GOT NOTHIN'.

08:33.984 --> 08:36.016
WELL, IS CATFISH
AT LEAST DELICIOUS?

08:36.016 --> 08:38.188
TASTES LIKE BUTT.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.851
DAD, I'M TRYING,
BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?

08:40.851 --> 08:44.254
(lowers voice) BECAUSE...

08:44.254 --> 08:48.028
(normal voice)
THIS IS WHY, BABY!
AAH!
KILL IT, KILL IT, KILL IT!

08:48.028 --> 08:51.101
WHOO-HOO! (laughs) OHH.
THIS IS A BIG ONE.
GOD, NO! GOD, NO!
KILL IT!

08:51.101 --> 08:54.104
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE
EVERY DECISION FOR ME?
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK!

08:54.104 --> 08:55.736
OH, I DON'T THINK?
NO.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.739
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! GUYS, WHEN DID
THIS TURN INTO A REAL FIGHT?

08:58.739 --> 09:02.142
HOW FAR INTO IT ARE WE?
BEING MARRIED TO YOU
IS EXHAUSTING!

09:02.142 --> 09:04.675
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ABOUT THE MIDWAY POINT.

09:04.675 --> 09:07.618
I SAY WE ALL JUST... CALM DOWN.
JULES,
I KNOW YOU GET SCARED

09:07.618 --> 09:09.780
WHEN PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT
FIGHT.
IT MAKES ME LOSE MY BREATH.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.983
I KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT DON'T TRY
TO DERAIL THIS ARGUMENT

09:12.983 --> 09:15.285
AND PUT THE FOCUS ON YOU.
NOW YOU'RE TELLING HER
WHAT TO DO.

09:15.285 --> 09:17.227
ANDY, SO HELP ME GOD,

09:17.227 --> 09:19.730
IF YOU OPEN THAT CHURRO HOLE
OF YOURS ONE MORE TIME--
I HAD SEX IN YOUR HOUSE.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.693
RIGHT OVER THERE.
SO? WE CONCEIVED STAN
ON YOUR KITCHEN ISLAND.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.165
I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.598
I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO BE FINE...

09:27.598 --> 09:29.870
OR AT LEAST CLOSER TO FINE.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.243
ISN'T THAT A SONG?
WHO--WHO SANG THAT?
THE INDIGO GIRLS.

09:33.243 --> 09:35.876
LADY GAY TRAP!
YOU'RE LADY GAY. (chuckles)

09:35.876 --> 09:37.608
IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE TIME.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.179
DON'T TRY
TO MAKE HER SMILE.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.282
I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE
TRYING TO MAKE HER HAPPY,

09:42.282 --> 09:44.014
BUT SHE NEVER TRIES
FOR ME!

09:44.014 --> 09:46.717
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I MARRIED YOU.
RIGHT BACK AT YOU!

09:46.717 --> 09:49.119
THAT'S TOO FAR.
EVERYONE'S GOING TOO FAR.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

09:49.119 --> 09:52.322
GOOD. GO!
(gasping) I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BREATHE.

09:52.322 --> 09:55.325
HEY, ANDY, YOU STILL HAVEN'T
PAID ME FOR THE BIKE,

09:55.325 --> 09:58.669
AND I HAVE A STRICT "YOU
BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT" POLICY

09:58.669 --> 10:01.071
ON EVERYTHING, AND, HONEY,
I MEAN EVERYTHING.

10:01.071 --> 10:02.733
SEE THESE? FAKE.
(taps)

10:02.733 --> 10:05.375
YEAH, MY EX-BOYFRIEND ENTERED ME
IN A FOXY BOXING COMPETITION,

10:05.375 --> 10:08.378
AND THE BITCH WHO KNOCKED THESE
OUT PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

10:08.378 --> 10:11.381
SHE DIED IN HER SLEEP.
I THINK IT WAS KARMA.

10:11.381 --> 10:14.214
YOU KNOW, OR MAYBE
IT WAS JUST HER TIME.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.385
(starts engine)

10:15.385 --> 10:18.649
POINT TAKEN.
TIME TO GO TASTE SOME FREEDOM.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.651
(engine revving)

10:20.651 --> 10:21.892
(thud)

10:21.892 --> 10:23.153
OH!

10:23.153 --> 10:25.696
YEAH, BIKE'S OKAY.

10:25.696 --> 10:28.829
MY WHOLE RIGHT SIDE KEPT IT
FROM HITTING THE GROUND.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.031
(mouths word, laughs)

10:31.031 --> 10:34.705
(engine revving)

10:34.705 --> 10:37.708
YOU OKAY? I'D GIVE YOU
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON--

10:37.708 --> 10:39.670
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD ONE.

10:41.371 --> 10:44.374
(pouring liquid)
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

10:44.374 --> 10:47.277
WHERE JUST EVERYTHING
GOES WRONG?
MY NANA DIED LAST THURSDAY.

10:47.277 --> 10:49.980
I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE HOSPITAL
BEFORE SHE PASSED,

10:49.980 --> 10:52.222
BECAUSE I RAN OVER
MY OWN DOG.
(door opens)

10:52.222 --> 10:54.885
(door closes)
YOU HAD TO TOP ME, TOM.

10:54.885 --> 10:57.688
TOM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:57.688 --> 11:00.660
HE'S BEING A GREAT FRIEND--
A GREAT GUY FRIEND.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.893
COME ON.
FRIEND SHAKE, TOM.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.234
(slaps, smacks)

11:04.234 --> 11:06.967
(smacks)
(mouths word)

11:06.967 --> 11:08.438
(snaps)
FRIENDS.

11:08.438 --> 11:11.371
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING YOU
COULD REPRODUCE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.243
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON ELLIE.

11:13.243 --> 11:15.906
POOR GIRL.
SHE'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME.

11:15.906 --> 11:17.708
GINGER TEA?
(door opens)

11:17.708 --> 11:19.449
(door closes)
(chuckles) I TELL YOU...

11:19.449 --> 11:21.451
NO, I-I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, TOM.

11:21.451 --> 11:23.053
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:23.053 --> 11:25.055
JULES IS IN A BAD WAY,
SO...

11:25.055 --> 11:27.758
(Southern accent)
HERE COMES GOOD OLD TOMMY

11:27.758 --> 11:30.120
WITH HIS MAGIC GINGER TEA.
(chuckles)

11:30.120 --> 11:32.122
(normal voice)
YOU PULL ANY CRAP WITH HER,

11:32.122 --> 11:33.824
AND YOU'LL ANSWER TO ME.

11:33.824 --> 11:35.125
NOW YOU CAN LOCK
YOUR DOORS,

11:35.125 --> 11:37.127
BUT I LIVE
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, TOM.

11:37.127 --> 11:39.069
I'LL JUST JUMP ON YOUR ROOF

11:39.069 --> 11:42.132
AND COME RIGHT DOWN
YOUR DAMN CHIMNEY,

11:42.132 --> 11:45.005
BUT I WON'T BE BRINGING
ANY PRESENTS. UNH-UNH.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.008
NOT UNLESS YOU ASKED SANTA
FOR THE HEEL OF MY BOOT.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.010
UH... I'M FEELING
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.242
(whispers) GOOD.
(slaps arm)

11:52.242 --> 11:53.984
OKAY, TRAV, YOU'RE UP.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.986
THERE'S A HOLE
RIGHT BENEATH ME.

11:55.986 --> 11:58.849
YOU'RE SURE I'M ONLY GONNA
FIND CATFISH IN THERE?

11:58.849 --> 12:00.220
ABSOLUTELY.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.922
OR A SNAKE.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.223
OR A BABY GATOR.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.325
(laughs) OR A REGULAR GATOR.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.497
JUST DO IT.

12:07.497 --> 12:10.030
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF,
ALL RIGHT? LOOK.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.102
OH!
DAD!

12:13.834 --> 12:16.266
DAD? DAD! AAH!
GATOR BITE!

12:16.266 --> 12:19.970
WHAT THE HELL?!
(laughs)
CLASSIC NOODLING PRANK.

12:19.970 --> 12:22.973
THAT'S IT.
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

12:22.973 --> 12:26.216
COME ON. I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE US A MEMORY.
WELL, I'LL MENTION IT
AT YOUR EULOGY.

12:26.216 --> 12:28.378
IS THIS WHOLE THING
MY FAULT?

12:28.378 --> 12:31.181
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S WHY
I ORDERED THE EXPENSIVE WINE.

12:31.181 --> 12:32.883
MMM. WELL,
THAT'S CONFUSING,

12:32.883 --> 12:35.155
BECAUSE THIS PUNISHMENT
IS DELICIOUS.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.158
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE I'M MAKING
A BIG DEAL ABOUT A MOTORCYCLE,

12:38.158 --> 12:39.459
BUT THEY'RE SO DANGEROUS,

12:39.459 --> 12:42.162
AND IF ANYTHING BAD
EVER HAPPENED TO ANDY,

12:42.162 --> 12:45.495
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO.
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

12:45.495 --> 12:47.467
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

12:47.467 --> 12:50.070
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REWARD
YOUR HUSBANDS

12:50.070 --> 12:53.173
WHEN THEY DO SOMETHING IDIOTIC.
WHAT ARE YOU, NEW?
WELL, IF I CAUSED THIS RIFT,
THEN I'M GONNA FIX IT.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.875
THERE'S NOTHING TO FIX.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.177
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH FIGHTS
LIKE THIS A THOUSAND TIMES.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.479
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
AH, SEE? IT'S ANDY.
(cell phone rings, beep)

12:59.479 --> 13:01.551
HEY, STAN'S BABY DANCE RECITAL
IS THIS AFTERNOON.

13:01.551 --> 13:06.116
DON'T BE LATE.
I'M GONNA STAY ON BOBBY'S BOAT
FOR A FEW DAYS.

13:06.116 --> 13:07.818
OH.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.119
OKAY.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.121
BYE.
(beep)

13:11.121 --> 13:13.093
(beep)

13:13.093 --> 13:14.524
WELL, THAT'S NEW.

13:14.524 --> 13:16.997
MMM.

13:18.528 --> 13:21.171
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST SO GOOD.

13:27.838 --> 13:30.810
(Ellie) IT IS NOT OKAY
FOR HIM TO JUST BAIL

13:30.810 --> 13:33.443
AND GO SLEEP SOMEWHERE ELSE
WITHOUT TRYING TO TALK IT OUT.
I KNOW.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.445
IF ANDY DOES NOT GO
TO STAN'S RECITAL,

13:35.445 --> 13:37.447
I SWEAR,
I'M GONNA CHANGE THE LOCKS.

13:37.447 --> 13:41.251
THIS IS JUST BETWEEN US,
OKAY?
I WON'T TELL A SOUL.
YOU ALL HEARD THAT,

13:41.251 --> 13:43.954
SO TECHNICALLY
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING.

13:43.954 --> 13:45.425
I MEAN, WHAT IS ANDY DOING?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.228
THIS IS WHY I USUALLY DON'T
MEDDLE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.300
ACTUALLY--
NOT THE TIME TO CALL ME
ON IT.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.003
I REMEMBER WHEN
MY DAD WALKED OUT ON MY MOM

13:53.003 --> 13:55.305
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
AND SHE WAS CRUSHED.

13:55.305 --> 13:58.168
AND THEN A MONTH LATER,
WHEN SHE REALIZED

13:58.168 --> 14:01.011
THAT HE HAD TAKEN
ME AND MY SISTER WITH HIM,

14:01.011 --> 14:03.543
IT GOT EVEN WORSE...
BUT THEN SHE FOUND US IN CABO,

14:03.543 --> 14:06.246
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
THE BEST FAMILY VACATION EVER,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.618
UNTIL WE DECIDED TO GO
HORSEBACK RIDING. OKAY.

14:08.618 --> 14:11.982
SO THIS ONE HORSE WAS PREGNANT,
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW IT, AND ITS--
THERE HAS TO BE
A STOPPING POINT.

14:11.982 --> 14:14.885
I'VE NEVER SEEN ELLIE
LIKE THIS.
REALLY? BECAUSE I'VE
ONLY SEEN HER LIKE THIS.

14:14.885 --> 14:17.988
YOU KNOW, IF THEY DON'T GET
A HANDLE ON THIS FIGHT,

14:17.988 --> 14:19.389
THEN IT'S--
IT'S GONNA BE TROUBLE.

14:19.389 --> 14:23.233
ALL RIGHT, WHO WANTS TO COME
WITH ME TO GET ANDY?
I'LL GO.

14:23.233 --> 14:25.065
NO, TOM. I'LL GO.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.367
WAS HE POINTING
TO HIS EYES?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.869
I-I COULDN'T TELL.
(door closes)

14:29.869 --> 14:32.202
THEY'RE REALLY TINY.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.474
WHO ARE YOU?

14:34.474 --> 14:37.247
AHH. YEAH.

14:37.247 --> 14:39.249
SURE WISH
YOU WOULD'VE CAUGHT ONE.

14:39.249 --> 14:41.381
THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.254
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SHARE
40 POUNDS OF CATFISH?

14:44.254 --> 14:47.187
SO I DIDN'T NOODLE.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.289
(sighs) WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO PISSY ABOUT THIS?

14:49.289 --> 14:51.261
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THAT
CONSERVATIVE BLONDE GIRL

14:51.261 --> 14:53.924
WHO ALWAYS GETS IN FIGHTS
ON "THE VIEW."

14:53.924 --> 14:55.465
ELISABETH HASSELBECK?
(singsong voice) GAY TRAP!

14:55.465 --> 14:58.528
(normal voice)
I'M TAKING A WALK.

14:58.528 --> 15:01.301
IT'S NOT FAIR!
THEY GANG UP ON HER.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.303
(scoffs)

15:03.303 --> 15:05.175
UGH. BUTT.

15:05.175 --> 15:09.279
I'M A MAN, JULES.
SHE TREATS ME LIKE A CHILD!
JUST COME DOWN AND TALK.

15:09.279 --> 15:10.610
FINE.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.313
AW, DUDE!
IT'S NOT A SURGICAL GOWN.
HEY, HEY.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.445
YOU GOTTA PUT CLOTHES
UNDERNEATH THERE.

15:15.445 --> 15:17.387
AW, FINE.
I'LL PUT ON BOXERS.

15:17.387 --> 15:20.220
AND I NEED YOU TO GO
TO STAN'S BABY DANCE RECITAL.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.623
NO! I WILL NOT DO IT.
NO, NO, NO, NO!
WELL, IF YOU WON'T GO
AS A PARENT,

15:23.623 --> 15:28.158
YOU CAN GO AS A CONTESTANT.
DO YOU KNOW WHY SHE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO HAVE A MOTORCYCLE?

15:28.158 --> 15:30.460
BECAUSE SHE CARES ABOUT YOU
SO MUCH,

15:30.460 --> 15:33.303
SHE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

15:33.303 --> 15:35.665
COME ON.
LET'S GO TO THE RECITAL.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.608
IT ALREADY STARTED,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.

15:38.608 --> 15:43.173
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT.
TRAFFIC WAS BUMPER-TO-BUMPER.
(sighs) OKAY, QUICK,
GRAB BOBBY'S BASEBALL HELMET.

15:43.173 --> 15:45.115
WHY?

15:45.115 --> 15:46.376
(engine revving)

15:46.376 --> 15:48.378
TOO FAST! TOO FAST!

15:48.378 --> 15:52.252
THIS IS HOW YOU TURN RIGHT
WITHOUT BRAKING. HOLD ON!

15:52.252 --> 15:54.584
(tires screeching)
NO!

15:54.584 --> 15:57.587
AAH! AAH! WOW.
I ALMOST FELL OFF.

15:57.587 --> 15:59.589
BE QUIET!
(laughs)

15:59.589 --> 16:03.033
(screaming)

16:03.033 --> 16:06.236
(tires screech)
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
OH, GOD. OH, GOD!

16:06.236 --> 16:07.667
(brakes squeal)

16:09.239 --> 16:12.342
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MISSED IT.

16:12.342 --> 16:16.506
IF YOU HADN'T JUMPED OFF
THE BACK AT THAT STOPLIGHT--
I WAS SCARED FOR MY LIFE,
JULES!

16:16.506 --> 16:19.509
YOU'RE NOT SAFE. I'M TAKING
A CAB BACK TO BOBBY'S.

16:19.509 --> 16:22.052
OH, ANDY. COME ON!

16:22.052 --> 16:24.054
HEY, JULES. MM.

16:24.054 --> 16:27.057
FEELS GOOD TO HAVE A LOT
OF POWER BETWEEN YOUR LEGS,

16:27.057 --> 16:28.358
DOESN'T IT?

16:28.358 --> 16:30.360
MOTORCYCLES ARE FUN, TOO.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.064
DO YOU JUST FOLLOW ME AROUND
WAITING TO SAY THINGS?

16:35.765 --> 16:38.328
DIDN'T MAKE IT, HUH?

16:38.328 --> 16:41.171
COME HERE.

16:41.171 --> 16:44.574
WOW. YOU WEREN'T KIDDING
ABOUT THESE NARROW SHOULDERS.

16:44.574 --> 16:48.108
YOU MUST'VE SHOT OUT
OF YOUR MOM LIKE A BULLET.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.711
TOM? WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR HAND?

16:51.711 --> 16:54.584
THIS ONE?
NOPE. THE OTHER ONE.

16:56.686 --> 16:58.188
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

16:58.188 --> 17:00.290
MM-HMM.

17:00.290 --> 17:02.322
HEY.
(knocks on door)

17:02.322 --> 17:05.295
I JUST WANTED TO COME IN
AND CHECK ON YOU. HOW YOU DOING?

17:05.295 --> 17:07.557
JULES SENT YOU.
BINGO-BANGO.

17:07.557 --> 17:10.160
JULES, GET YOUR TINY ROUND ASS
IN HERE.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.202
HEY, THANKS
FOR THE "ROUND ASS,"

17:12.202 --> 17:14.334
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING LUNGES.
(laughs)

17:14.334 --> 17:17.036
I'M SO SORRY
I BROKE YOU AND ANDY.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.039
WHATEVS. DO YOU HAVE ANY
RED WINE? I'M OUT OF RED WINE.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.772
YEAH, LIKE 2,000 BOTTLES.
WHA--CAN WE BE REAL?

17:22.772 --> 17:25.815
I NEED
YOU AND ANDY TO WORK.

17:25.815 --> 17:27.317
YOU'RE THE ONLY COUPLE

17:27.317 --> 17:29.819
THAT MAKES ME STILL BELIEVE
IN MARRIAGE, YOU KNOW?

17:29.819 --> 17:31.321
OHH. SO LAME.

17:31.321 --> 17:34.284
I KNOW, RIGHT?
HEY, I FOUND SOME RED.

17:34.284 --> 17:35.755
WAIT. YOU TWO MADE UP?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.757
NOT YET, BUT WE WILL.
DUMMY.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.729
WITCH. ANYBODY WANT WINE?

17:39.729 --> 17:42.832
ALWAYS. WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I NEVER KNOW.

17:42.832 --> 17:44.834
JULES IS WIGGED-OUT
BY OUR FIGHT,

17:44.834 --> 17:46.836
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

17:46.836 --> 17:49.599
TO BE IN
A GOOD, HEALTHY MARRIAGE.
OH, YES, I DO.

17:49.599 --> 17:51.601
(whispers) NO, YOU DON'T.
I REALLY DON'T.

17:51.601 --> 17:53.603
WHAT'S SHE GONNA DO?
THROW AWAY OUR LIVES

17:53.603 --> 17:56.106
BECAUSE I PRETENDED
TO LEAVE HOME FOR A NIGHT

17:56.106 --> 17:57.577
AND SKIPPED
A BABY DANCE RECITAL?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.550
STAN'S 1.
I BET HE DIDN'T EVEN MOVE.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.812
HE PEED HIMSELF
AND THEN FELL ASLEEP.

18:02.812 --> 18:05.315
(wine pours)
JULES, WHEN
A MARRIAGE REALLY WORKS,

18:05.315 --> 18:07.317
THE TINY BUMPS
IN THE ROAD DON'T MATTER.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.289
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED,

18:09.289 --> 18:11.121
'CAUSE THERE'S
NEVER ANY REAL JEOPARDY.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.523
WE HAVE
A BUILT-IN SAFETY NET,

18:13.523 --> 18:16.126
'CAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER
SO MUCH.

18:16.126 --> 18:18.598
I'M GONNA CRY.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.300
I'M NOT,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
BECAUSE MY EYES ARE SO TINY.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.274
I'M OWNING IT.

18:24.274 --> 18:27.277
(Whiskeytown) в™Є DON'T WANNA KNOW
WHY YOU LIKE ME в™Є

18:27.277 --> 18:28.538
в™Є I DON'T CARE в™Є

18:28.538 --> 18:31.281
SKIPPING ROCKS?
WHAT'S YOUR RECORD?

18:31.281 --> 18:32.582
FOUR.

18:32.582 --> 18:35.285
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MORE,
BUT I HIT A DUCK.

18:35.285 --> 18:38.288
I SHOULD FEEL BAD,
BUT I DON'T. I HATE DUCKS.

18:38.288 --> 18:39.589
YEAH, ME, TOO.

18:39.589 --> 18:41.591
WELL,
OUR MUTUAL DUCK HATRED

18:41.591 --> 18:44.224
ISN'T GONNA MAKE
EVERYTHING BETTER. OKAY, DAD?
(water splashes)

18:44.224 --> 18:45.725
I KNOW.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.727
PLUS I LOVE DUCKS.
(laughs)

18:47.727 --> 18:50.730
SERIOUSLY, THEY MAKE ME LAUGH
EVERY TIME THEY QUACK.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.402
(laughs)

18:52.402 --> 18:53.863
(sighs)

18:53.863 --> 18:56.406
HEY, LOOK, TRAV,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT NOODLING.

18:56.406 --> 18:59.409
REMEMBER HOW I DIDN'T THINK
OF YOU FOR THIS TRIP,

18:59.409 --> 19:01.311
BECAUSE I SAID
IT WAS A MAN'S TRIP?

19:01.311 --> 19:03.643
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I CHERISH THAT MOMENT.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.346
(laughs) LOOK, WHEN YOU WERE
JUST A YOUNG PUP,

19:06.346 --> 19:08.648
IF I, UH, TOOK YOU
INTO A LAKE

19:08.648 --> 19:11.581
AND I ASKED YOU TO STICK
YOUR ARM DOWN A GIANT HOLE,

19:11.581 --> 19:13.683
YOU JUST WOULD'VE DONE IT.

19:13.683 --> 19:16.686
NOW YOU'RE 18. YOU SAID NO,
AND YOU BITCHED ABOUT IT.

19:16.686 --> 19:19.329
BUT, TRAVIS,
YOU BITCHED LIKE A MAN.

19:19.329 --> 19:21.331
(both laugh)

19:21.331 --> 19:23.293
WELL, THIS MAY BE SAPPY,

19:23.293 --> 19:26.296
BUT, UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M QUITE READY YET

19:26.296 --> 19:28.298
FOR YOU TO BE A GROWN-UP.

19:28.298 --> 19:31.341
I'M SORRY IF I ACTED
LIKE ELISABETH HASSELBECK.

19:31.341 --> 19:33.303
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:33.303 --> 19:35.805
YOU CAN DO
THE ARM THING NOW,

19:35.805 --> 19:37.307
IF YOU WANT.

19:37.307 --> 19:39.309
в™Єв™Є

19:39.309 --> 19:41.811
(ducks quacking)

19:41.811 --> 19:43.653
(laughs) THOSE GUYS!

19:43.653 --> 19:45.755
в™Є DON'T WANNA KNOW
HOW YOU'RE FEELING в™Є

19:45.755 --> 19:48.288
(footsteps overhead)

19:48.288 --> 19:51.261
в™Є I DON'T CARE в™Є

19:51.261 --> 19:56.396
в™Є DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL MEET ME в™Є

19:56.396 --> 19:58.528
в™Є I'M NOT THERE в™Є

19:58.528 --> 20:01.371
WHERE WERE YOU?

20:01.371 --> 20:03.373
NOWHERE. HE LOOKS HAPPY.

20:03.373 --> 20:04.974
(engine revving)

20:04.974 --> 20:07.377
WHEE-HEE-HEE-HEE!

20:07.377 --> 20:11.241
HE GETS TO RIDE TEN MINUTES
A DAY WITH SUPERVISION.
MM.

20:11.241 --> 20:12.782
(laughs) YEAH.
(engine turns off)

20:12.782 --> 20:16.516
DID I LOOK
LIKE I WAS GOING FAST?
SO FAST.
BUT YOUR TIME'S UP.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.988
OH, COME ON.
FINE. JUST ONE MORE MINUTE,

20:18.988 --> 20:21.451
BUT I GET
TO TAKE PICTURES OF YOU.

20:21.451 --> 20:22.952
OKAY.
OKAY.

20:22.952 --> 20:24.524
(revs engine)
(camera shutter clicks)

20:24.524 --> 20:27.226
YOU KNOW,
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME

20:27.226 --> 20:29.829
TRYING TO SEPARATE
ROMANCE AND FRIENDSHIP.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.831
I GUESS IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.333
YOU GET BOTH.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.305
YEAH.

20:35.305 --> 20:37.767
I WANT THAT SOMEDAY,
YOU KNOW?

20:37.767 --> 20:40.510
ME, TOO.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.011
BUT NOT NOW.

20:42.011 --> 20:44.314
NO. (laughs)
NOT NOW. LATER.

20:44.314 --> 20:47.317
(engine revving)

20:47.317 --> 20:48.818
(thud)

20:48.818 --> 20:50.320
YOU KNOW, JULES,

20:50.320 --> 20:53.323
EVEN IF THERE WASN'T
A SEXUAL... UNDERCURRENT,

20:53.323 --> 20:55.985
I'D STILL BE YOUR FRIEND.

20:55.985 --> 20:57.487
OHH.

20:57.487 --> 21:00.029
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.

21:00.029 --> 21:02.692
в™Є WHY в™Є

21:08.738 --> 21:10.269
TRAV!

21:10.269 --> 21:11.771
YOU HERE?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.272
TRAV!

21:13.272 --> 21:15.545
(quack)

21:15.545 --> 21:17.547
(laughs)
(water splashes)

21:17.547 --> 21:19.549
HEY, TRAV,
WHERE ARE YOU, BUDDY?

21:19.549 --> 21:22.652
(grunting and panting)

21:25.014 --> 21:27.917
(voice breaks)
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.560
HELL, YEAH.
WHOO!

21:30.560 --> 21:33.062
NOW CAN YOU GET IT OFF ME?

21:33.062 --> 21:36.566
THE BIG ONE ATE A SMALLER ONE
THAT'S ALSO ON MY ARM. UHH!

21:36.566 --> 21:38.568
(grunts)
THAT'S MY BOY.
