Funny you should ask.

13:13.908 --> 13:15.774
<i>[ muffled ]
Let me out of here!</i>

13:15.810 --> 13:20.746
[ sighs ] Finally.
Oh, it's you.

13:20.815 --> 13:22.014
Rook: You did not.

13:22.049 --> 13:24.650
The Vreedle brothers
have left the building.

13:24.719 --> 13:26.352
NRG: With what might be the

13:26.387 --> 13:33.125
most destructive
device in the universe?!

13:33.194 --> 13:38.397
And they're heading to
Earth with it! Argit!

13:38.466 --> 13:41.334
Oh, like this my fault?

13:45.412 --> 13:48.614
Agh! Unh!

13:48.649 --> 13:49.882
Ben: We've got to catch the

13:49.917 --> 13:53.619
Vreedle brothers before they
set off that, uh, t-that...

13:53.654 --> 13:56.255
<i>All: Annihilarrgh!</i>

13:56.324 --> 13:59.191
Ben: Whatever. I still
say it's not a real threat.

13:59.227 --> 14:02.261
But I don't want to take any
chances when it comes to the Earth.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.530
Rook: What about the Incursians?

14:04.565 --> 14:07.733
Ben: Argit, keep Emperor
Milius from escaping.

14:07.769 --> 14:14.006
Emperor Milius, if you escape,
don't hurt Argit ... too much.

14:14.075 --> 14:17.009
Oh, yeah!
I'm in charge now.

14:17.078 --> 14:21.480
What do you got to say
about that, frog face, huh?

14:21.549 --> 14:25.284
[ croaks ]

14:25.320 --> 14:26.452
[ clears throat ]

14:26.521 --> 14:29.021
Of course, I meant emperfrog face.

14:29.056 --> 14:31.023
[ chuckles nervously ]

14:38.764 --> 14:40.731
[ beep ]

14:48.039 --> 14:49.005
Ooh-wee!

14:49.074 --> 14:53.577
I've been a-waiting to
blow something up all day!

15:03.122 --> 15:06.925
[ bird chirps ]

15:06.960 --> 15:09.360
- Ben: Rook!
- Rook: Ben!

15:09.396 --> 15:12.931
Ben: We can't keep this up!

15:12.999 --> 15:14.832
Rook: You're right about that.

15:14.868 --> 15:20.237
We're going down! Hang on!

15:20.306 --> 15:23.773
<i>Waa-haa-haa-hooie!</i>

15:27.111 --> 15:29.045
[ both scream ]

15:32.617 --> 15:34.318
[ moans ]

15:34.387 --> 15:35.686
[ both grunt ]

15:35.755 --> 15:39.223
Ben: Next time, I drive.

15:47.299 --> 15:52.203
[ Incursians croaking ]

15:52.238 --> 15:56.407
- Rook: This looks bad.
- Ben: And it's about to get worse.

15:56.442 --> 15:58.943
Attention, Amphibians.

15:58.978 --> 16:02.880
My brother, Boid, and myself
hereby suggest that y'all

16:02.916 --> 16:08.887
surrender your weapons,
or we shall be obliged to use this.

16:08.922 --> 16:10.889
[ gasps ]
[ sighs ]

16:10.925 --> 16:13.993
Got to be an "on" button somewheres.

16:14.062 --> 16:16.162
Ben: That's... it?

16:16.197 --> 16:19.399
Rook: I admit, it's far
less impressive in person.

16:19.435 --> 16:22.269
Ben: Not a very
convincing doomsday device.

16:22.304 --> 16:25.538
Ben, do something!

16:25.574 --> 16:28.808
Rook: Please, put that thing
down before it goes off!

16:28.844 --> 16:32.544
Well, sir, that there only
further piques our interest,

16:32.613 --> 16:36.248
seeing as what we enjoys
most is blowing stuff up.

16:36.283 --> 16:37.249
Real good.

16:37.284 --> 16:42.454
If anyone's gonna do any threatening
around here, it's gonna be me.

16:42.489 --> 16:45.523
- Ben!
- Ben: Just be cool, Argit.

16:45.559 --> 16:47.726
I got this.

16:47.761 --> 16:48.360
[ taps ]

16:48.429 --> 16:49.528
[ exhales sharply ]

16:49.563 --> 16:53.165
I-I-I can't
take it anymore!

16:53.200 --> 16:53.832
[ shouts ]

16:53.901 --> 16:55.734
Ben: See, that's not being cool.

16:55.803 --> 16:59.104
That's, like, the
opposite of being cool.

16:59.173 --> 17:00.105
Hey!

17:00.173 --> 17:03.542
[ all grunting ]

17:03.577 --> 17:04.542
Ben: [ grunts ]

17:04.578 --> 17:08.378
I gots it!

17:08.448 --> 17:13.018
Whoa!
I don't gots it!

17:13.053 --> 17:16.820
[ all gasp ]

17:16.890 --> 17:18.623
[ shouts ]

17:18.659 --> 17:21.759
[ all sigh ]

17:21.828 --> 17:23.727
Huh?

17:23.762 --> 17:28.933
Uh, that is what y'all call your
basic countdown to destruction.

17:29.002 --> 17:34.839
Ergo, I recommend that we all repair
to a safe distance from said destruction.

17:34.875 --> 17:38.376
There no safe distance, you boobs!

17:38.412 --> 17:41.646
It... is going...
to destroy the universe!

17:41.682 --> 17:46.018
Clearly, we did not think this through.

17:46.087 --> 17:49.588
How do you shut this thing off?

17:49.624 --> 17:51.657
Why are you all standing around?!

17:51.726 --> 17:54.126
Somebody has to stop
this from happening!

17:54.162 --> 17:57.030
T-the universe is where
I keep all my stuff!

17:57.065 --> 18:00.500
[ grunting ]

18:00.535 --> 18:04.004
Ben: Dude, not helpful!

18:04.039 --> 18:08.208
All right, listen, Omnitrix,
I don't want Goop. I don't want Stinkfly.

18:08.243 --> 18:09.843
Just give me something I can use

18:09.878 --> 18:13.212
to diffuse this thing so we
can all get on with our lives.

18:13.248 --> 18:18.217
[ beep ]

18:18.252 --> 18:23.789
Rook: [ gasps ] Alien X!
It is real!

18:23.824 --> 18:26.291
So, this is Alien X, huh?

18:26.327 --> 18:28.694
[ warbling ]

18:28.729 --> 18:30.696
Great, we're toast.

18:50.953 --> 18:56.424
<i>Oh, look, Belicus. Ben Tennyson
has come to visit us again.</i>

18:56.493 --> 18:59.260
<i>Great. Tell me when he leaves.</i>

18:59.295 --> 19:03.330
Ben: Wait. The universe
really is being destroyed?

19:03.366 --> 19:05.266
[ indistinct screaming ]

19:05.301 --> 19:08.069
<i>Must they make so much noise?</i>

19:08.138 --> 19:11.906
<i>It is futile but a
bit sad to see them go.</i>

19:11.975 --> 19:14.075
Ben: Belicus, Serena, you got

19:14.144 --> 19:17.913
to let me use Alien X
to stop the Annihilarrgh!

19:17.948 --> 19:19.615
Hey, I finally said it.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.717
<i>Oh, it's too late for that.</i>

19:21.753 --> 19:23.619
Ben: What?
I-it can't be!

19:23.655 --> 19:27.990
<i>I'm afraid it is. Oh, I can
sense your disappointment.</i>

19:28.025 --> 19:31.193
Ben: Disappointment?!
That's the universe!

19:31.262 --> 19:34.563
It's everything I know!
It's everything there is!

19:34.632 --> 19:36.832
<i>- Was.
- Technically.</i>

19:36.901 --> 19:41.003
Ben: But Alien X can
fix this, right? Right?!

19:41.038 --> 19:43.205
<i>Alien X can do many things.</i>

19:43.274 --> 19:45.908
<i>We just both have to agree to it.</i>

19:45.976 --> 19:49.244
<i>[ singsong voice ]
Belicus.</i>

19:49.280 --> 19:51.914
<i>[ gruff singsong ]
Serena.</i>

19:51.949 --> 19:55.284
<i>Fine, but the next time the
universe and everything in it is</i>

19:55.320 --> 20:00.191
<i>destroyed, don't come crying to me.</i>

20:01.259 --> 20:04.194
[ electricity crackling ]

20:25.815 --> 20:29.218
[ beeping ]

20:29.254 --> 20:32.856
- Ben: Whoa.
- No boom?

20:32.891 --> 20:33.857
[ croaks ]

20:33.892 --> 20:40.030
- Oh, it's a dud!
- Well, well, well, too bad about that.

20:40.065 --> 20:43.200
But I did get it for you,
Milius, and a deal's a deal, so

20:43.235 --> 20:45.736
how about that half ton
of Taydenite you owe me?

20:45.772 --> 20:46.670
[ fingers snap ]

20:46.706 --> 20:47.504
[ weapons whir ]

20:47.540 --> 20:49.139
Or we could just call it even.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.041
[ chuckles nervously ]

20:51.076 --> 20:52.943
Unh!

20:52.978 --> 20:55.145
[ slurping ]

20:55.214 --> 20:58.115
Rook: That is... difficult to believe.

20:58.150 --> 21:00.784
Ben: I know, right?
I was too late to save the

21:00.819 --> 21:04.054
universe, so I used
Alien X to make a whole new one.

21:04.090 --> 21:07.324
Yeah, not buying it.
Nothing's different.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.494
Ben: Of course not.
I made an exact copy.

21:10.529 --> 21:14.231
- Rook: Of everything?
- Ben: Yes, everything.

21:14.299 --> 21:18.769
- Rook: In the universe?
- Ben: Including you.

21:18.805 --> 21:20.138
[ slurping stops ]

21:20.207 --> 21:21.773
Rook: So you have said.

21:21.809 --> 21:24.709
I am sorry, Ben, but I
have no memory of this.

21:24.745 --> 21:28.979
What is more likely ... that you
had a panic-induced hallucination...

21:29.015 --> 21:33.984
Or that oh-so-special you are the only
thing that's left of the entire universe?

21:34.053 --> 21:37.087
Ben: Fine. Don't
believe me. I don't care.

21:37.156 --> 21:40.791
I did it.
I saved the universe... again.

21:40.859 --> 21:43.993
That's all that matters.
You should be thanking me.

21:44.062 --> 21:45.895
[ slurping ]

21:45.964 --> 21:48.398
Ben: Doesn't taste the same...
