00:03.760 --> 00:06.889
I'll be in London one week,
at this address.

00:07.160 --> 00:09.447
Finish your business here
and join me.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.090
<i>"Dear Grace...</i>

00:16.040 --> 00:19.726
<i>"Before the war, when I had
an important decision to make,</i>

00:20.400 --> 00:22.004
<i>"I used to flip a coin.</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:28.487
<i>"Perhaps that is what
I will do again."</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:48.720 --> 02:51.291
...and give him peace. Amen.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.690
Amen.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.167
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

03:07.560 --> 03:09.642
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

03:09.720 --> 03:11.404
if he should pass before me.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.605
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.682
When we were in France,
fighting for the King.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.886
Amen.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.249
And in the end it
wasn't war that took Freddie.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.005
--Pestilence took him.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.442
Come here.

03:33.640 --> 03:38.282
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

03:38.480 --> 03:41.131
- before he was cruelly taken.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.008
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

03:51.520 --> 03:54.126
- you might come back to Birmingham.

03:56.560 --> 03:57.971
God, do you know how funny it is

03:58.040 --> 04:00.566
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.882
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.004
Do you know how unfair it is

04:05.080 --> 04:08.209
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

04:09.360 --> 04:12.603
So now they've made you ashamed
of us, eh?

04:13.640 --> 04:16.882
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.450
Karl's with his cousins.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.326
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.681
Ada.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.965
Are you coming home?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.645
I'm going home.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.525
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.284
That's not what I said.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.722
There's another reason
we want you home.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.203
We're planning an expansion.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.203
- I'm taking premises in London...

04:43.280 --> 04:45.282
Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.728
Polly, if Ada was
weeping then I'd stop.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.165
But she's not.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.482
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

04:52.560 --> 04:54.324
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.881
Yeah.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.322
Well, I'm not a Shelby any more.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.362
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.446
I'm free.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.809
I've got to get Karl home.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.808
--I told you.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.731
Let me do it.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.371
It's all right.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.610
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.968
"Till the danger passes"?

05:37.640 --> 05:39.165
That'll be the bloody day.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.091
Go on, move away, go on.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.331
It happened at, uh, exactly 7 a.m.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.366
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.968
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

06:30.680 --> 06:33.809
I'd say it was something to do
with the gas.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.844
It's just been fitted.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.366
Er, madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.371
--Madam!

06:56.120 --> 06:57.963
This is all over the place.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.040
Confetti.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.840
You can go.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.127
Right.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.321
Who?

07:21.720 --> 07:23.290
Who did this to us?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.241
Whiskey. Irish.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.167
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.243
Gas and electric don't mix.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.364
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.921
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

08:11.160 --> 08:12.605
You know something?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.402
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

08:15.480 --> 08:17.369
business is surprisingly good.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.480
Which one of you is
the Peaky Blinder devil?

08:30.720 --> 08:32.085
Gentlemen.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.809
Finn! Get in here.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.201
Finn! Hold the phone. Come here.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.049
- Take the odds.
-Yeah, sure.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.800
Polly.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.364
Did he say who did it?

10:03.440 --> 10:05.363
He's gone to the Black Lion.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.526
On his own?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.367
Tommy does everything on his own.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.080
- Should I go to the Black Lion?
-What?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.640
- Should I go there and see him?
-No.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.369
Where the fuck is Arthur?

10:18.440 --> 10:21.171
Protecting the Garrison's
whisky from the police.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.489
For fuck's sake!

10:27.720 --> 10:32.851
Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.405
So get 'em in hand.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.362
Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

10:42.280 --> 10:47.127
She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.448
She said we look like ghosts.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.846
She'll be back.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.761
When?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.731
When she needs us.

10:58.360 --> 11:02.410
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

11:02.600 --> 11:05.171
- Six.
-Six what?

11:05.360 --> 11:07.601
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.243
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.367
Why?

11:19.160 --> 11:20.446
Seven.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.523
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

11:26.480 --> 11:28.403
or we'll find somebody else who can.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.686
--Thomas Shelby.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.245
You blew up my pub.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.081
Anger defeats fear, good.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.770
You blew up my pub.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.240
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.410
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

12:04.680 --> 12:08.969
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.564
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

12:15.840 --> 12:17.569
I read somewhere that you Paddies

12:17.640 --> 12:19.642
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.529
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.651
That's funny, don't you think?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.969
A war about peace.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.926
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

12:38.080 --> 12:40.162
Forgive me, I get confused.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.762
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.688
So stop fucking smiling.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.128
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.728
You have a son at the
Cherrywood Road School in Harborne.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.883
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

13:05.960 --> 13:09.760
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.322
Poor boy if the race was important.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.289
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.328
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.688
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.681
No.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.327
He researches his enemies,

13:34.720 --> 13:36.529
that's why he's been chosen.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.651
I am chosen?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.281
I'm chosen.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.203
Can the chosen one smoke?

14:01.920 --> 14:05.925
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.691
Chosen by whom?

14:12.280 --> 14:14.328
By an informed consensus.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.685
I have things to do.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.647
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

14:22.000 --> 14:24.082
what he's been chosen for.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.683
From now on, Mr Shelby,

14:28.000 --> 14:32.324
you shut your fucking gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.610
Fuck!

16:15.240 --> 16:17.686
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

16:17.760 --> 16:20.889
clear of coppers between
midnight and 4:00 tonight.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.249
Right. Could I ask why?

16:26.400 --> 16:30.644
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.087
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

16:33.840 --> 16:35.808
That's all. You can go.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.289
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.240
No charge.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.051
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.442
He's, uh, just passing through, he says.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.606
Very grand these days.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.251
He's head of some
secret department,

16:58.840 --> 17:00.251
the Irish Desk.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.770
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.404
I'll say good night, Tom.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.165
I demand to speak
to a representative!

17:22.760 --> 17:25.650
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

17:30.320 --> 17:32.322
Father! Father!

17:32.400 --> 17:35.449
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

17:35.520 --> 17:37.045
Get the fuck off me!

17:37.120 --> 17:39.964
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.362
I demand to speak to a representative
of His Majesty the King!

17:43.440 --> 17:44.726
Make your peace with God.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.849
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

17:48.000 --> 17:49.490
- Father.
-Come on.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.528
Now, wait!
Where are you going?

17:53.640 --> 17:56.405
Does someone here have
business with the King?

17:57.080 --> 17:58.605
Major Campbell.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.967
--About time.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.569
I am a very busy man, Governor.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.125
In seven and a half minutes,

18:07.200 --> 18:09.885
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.565
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.126
No, Governor,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.165
I hear no bells.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.485
Since yesterday morning,

18:24.560 --> 18:26.562
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

18:26.640 --> 18:28.722
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.804
It's a little late
to be coming up with nonsense like that,

18:31.880 --> 18:33.086
don't you think?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.003
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

18:35.080 --> 18:37.003
there would be a last-minute pardon,

18:37.360 --> 18:39.362
which has not materialised.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.404
Forgive me, Governor,

18:43.200 --> 18:45.726
but what business is this of mine?

18:47.480 --> 18:49.005
He says the man who hired him

18:49.080 --> 18:51.526
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

18:52.480 --> 18:53.891
an Ulsterman.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.926
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.002
a bullet wound in his right leg.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.921
No.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.162
Still no bells. Governor,

19:06.960 --> 19:10.089
you have a very clear remit.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.246
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

19:14.520 --> 19:17.649
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.688
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man

19:23.240 --> 19:24.969
to the gates of hell.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.006
Is that clear?

19:29.920 --> 19:33.402
And if you should ever have
the desire

19:33.480 --> 19:36.006
to discuss this matter
with anyone else

19:37.440 --> 19:40.046
I know where you live.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.767
Arthur, Tommy's
called a family meeting.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.447
Arthur!

20:00.520 --> 20:02.841
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.400
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.846
Arthur.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.165
2,000.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.491
Come on.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.491
Sit down, Finn.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.204
- Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
-He's on his way.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.246
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

21:14.880 --> 21:16.882
Whisky.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.727
Left over from the explosion.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.170
It's good stuff, as well.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.920
Right.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.165
Before Tommy gets here,

21:42.200 --> 21:44.168
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

21:44.240 --> 21:45.651
between the rest of us.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.846
You think?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.206
Yeah.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.323
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

21:54.040 --> 21:56.930
When did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

22:01.440 --> 22:03.408
You have anything to say,

22:03.800 --> 22:05.290
you wait for Thomas.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.691
Polly's fucking right.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.330
I see all the books.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.250
Legal and off track.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.409
Sort of stuff you don't see.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.885
And in the past year

22:19.840 --> 22:21.490
the Shelby Company Limited

22:21.560 --> 22:25.849
has been making £150

22:26.720 --> 22:28.006
a day.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.883
Right? A fucking day!

22:31.960 --> 22:33.405
Sometimes more.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.729
So what I want to know

22:37.200 --> 22:40.249
is why are we changing things?

22:40.520 --> 22:43.046
Polly, look what's happened already.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.043
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

22:46.200 --> 22:47.964
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.407
- Who said anything about cockneys?
-Who else?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.209
Do you know who did it, do you?

22:52.560 --> 22:54.927
- No, she doesn't know who did it.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.647
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.969
Everyone's allowed to speak.

23:01.920 --> 23:05.049
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.044
I speak for our household.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.886
- So...
-john, this company is

23:13.960 --> 23:17.282
a modern enterprise and believes in
equal rights for women.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.805
On your feet, Esme.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.171
I'm not a blood member
of this family

23:34.840 --> 23:37.127
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm not a member

23:37.200 --> 23:39.362
I can see things
in a different light.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.165
So I'll get to my point.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.970
That would be nice.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.326
As my husband said,

23:45.400 --> 23:48.131
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.089
--But London...

23:51.280 --> 23:54.011
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.326
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.765
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.922
And there are foreigners
of every description

24:06.040 --> 24:08.327
and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.450
I have a child,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.321
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.802
I want John to see him grow up.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.040
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

24:25.320 --> 24:27.209
and keep chickens or something.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.366
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.041
Thomas?

24:37.680 --> 24:39.205
That's all I have to say.

24:41.320 --> 24:45.530
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.488
Wash them down with a nice drink.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.491
Thank you, Esme.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.130
Firstly, the bang in the pub
had nothing to do with London.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.486
Understood?

24:59.720 --> 25:01.722
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.691
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

25:05.760 --> 25:07.569
so long as we stick together.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.086
And after the first few weeks,

25:10.160 --> 25:12.401
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.522
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

25:16.760 --> 25:17.966
That's right.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.201
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed your reservations.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.486
Fair enough.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.929
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

25:27.160 --> 25:28.571
walk out the door...

25:32.720 --> 25:34.051
Right now.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.404
Go raise your chickens.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.682
For those of you with ambition

25:42.560 --> 25:44.642
the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.925
Tomorrow?

26:00.400 --> 26:03.085
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.123
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.770
We have 18 staff.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.161
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

26:12.240 --> 26:14.402
Oh, I changed the combination.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.685
--So what's going on, Thomas?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.648
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

26:26.520 --> 26:28.648
Give me the combination, Polly.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.084
Polly, give me the combination.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.041
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.488
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

26:49.560 --> 26:52.450
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.651
So why tomorrow?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.682
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.922
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.282
What say you just roll up
and take the city?

27:04.680 --> 27:08.002
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.808
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

27:12.880 --> 27:14.803
have been at war in London
for six months.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.006
It's not our war.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.401
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.847
- Yeah, but we don't.
-We need a foothold

27:20.920 --> 27:23.002
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.242
The Jews control Camden Town.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.890
Your mother said,

27:35.440 --> 27:37.408
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

27:39.320 --> 27:41.209
No-one gets killed, Polly.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.162
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.449
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

27:48.520 --> 27:50.921
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

27:51.000 --> 27:53.731
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.885
Now please, open the fucking safe.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.488
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there,

28:08.280 --> 28:11.682
about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.609
But when it comes to it,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.802
you don't listen to a word we say.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.004
Maybe you don't trust us.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.604
She was one woman, Thomas.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.841
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.410
Forgot about who?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.966
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.443
Are you going to London now?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.408
No, there's something
I have to do first.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.931
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.244
I got it out of a catalogue.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.286
I'm doing a correspondence course.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.249
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.970
It's a test you have to do.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.602
Will you come back before you go?

30:21.200 --> 30:22.406
No.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.324
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

30:42.880 --> 30:44.689
as if we were ordinary people.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.161
Yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.525
Let's begin.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.810
Hands on the table.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.721
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.962
So, let's welcome them.

32:11.440 --> 32:12.805
Starting with you.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.727
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

32:16.640 --> 32:18.005
My husband.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.770
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.451
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

32:25.520 --> 32:28.364
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.530
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.651
She's an unsanctified charlatan.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.840
And you?

32:44.240 --> 32:45.730
Who do you seek?

32:47.600 --> 32:49.728
Well, truth...

32:49.800 --> 32:52.770
Sorry, truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.842
So I came here to find out.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.800
Er...

33:02.920 --> 33:05.002
You see, my son and my daughter

33:05.320 --> 33:08.005
were taken from me
when they were very small.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.044
Taken by the parish authorities

33:10.120 --> 33:12.043
and I never knew
what happened to them.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.124
But lately...

33:18.000 --> 33:19.490
I've had a feeling.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.005
Like, a feeling...

33:27.200 --> 33:29.043
I can't put it into words.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.206
And I keep having a dream.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.410
I see a pretty girl,

33:40.480 --> 33:42.130
about 18-yea rs-old.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.446
She's standing
across the street

33:48.240 --> 33:52.165
and she tells me
she's passed over.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.805
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.841
On May 15th.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.170
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

34:13.639 --> 34:17.485
And she shouts and shouts.

34:19.080 --> 34:23.210
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

34:23.639 --> 34:25.210
because I'm her mother.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.925
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

34:34.400 --> 34:36.368
after they stole her from me.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.967
But if she does want
to say goodbye,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.922
I thought this would be the place.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.962
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.120
You're gypsy?

34:54.320 --> 34:57.130
The part of me that dreams is gypsy.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.082
My maiden name is Shelby.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.886
So,

35:26.760 --> 35:28.728
perhaps you could do me first.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.685
No!

35:42.240 --> 35:43.685
No!

35:45.280 --> 35:46.930
No!

35:58.480 --> 36:00.244
No...

37:55.360 --> 37:56.885
Eamonn Duggan?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.449
All right, Tommy's here.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.330
Hang on!

38:30.280 --> 38:31.520
John!

38:31.600 --> 38:32.931
I'm coming!

38:41.320 --> 38:44.005
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

38:44.080 --> 38:45.809
10 if I'm still sober.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.243
I got it from the doctor.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.522
Keeps me nice and calm.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.643
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

38:55.720 --> 38:57.484
to stop us fucking wanking.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.164
Polly said it's good for me temper.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.208
- It slows me down, Tom.
-Arthur,

39:01.560 --> 39:04.086
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

39:04.160 --> 39:08.006
- I need you fast. Not slow, eh?

39:08.200 --> 39:09.804
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.484
I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of.

39:11.560 --> 39:15.770
Right. You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.524
Nothing wrong with opinions, john.
Come on.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.284
- Get in the fucking car!
-Shut up.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.611
Right!

39:25.680 --> 39:28.604
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

39:28.680 --> 39:30.967
Sit down, you mad bastard.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.961
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.966
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

40:03.040 --> 40:05.008
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.205
She's one of ours.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.244
Anything over a pound, tell me.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.927
Polly,

40:20.240 --> 40:22.447
I don't wish to pry
into your business,

40:23.120 --> 40:24.770
but you should know something.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.048
That woman is a trickster.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.725
What woman?

40:30.440 --> 40:32.886
Her sister was in
the washhouse early,

40:33.560 --> 40:36.006
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.166
What woman?

40:42.160 --> 40:43.969
Gypsies talk to each other.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.729
What woman?

40:50.120 --> 40:52.851
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.565
I'm sorry...

41:00.440 --> 41:01.885
So what do you know?

41:02.120 --> 41:03.884
I know they push the glass.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.203
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.441
It's a trick.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.048
They tell you what
you already believe.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.924
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.122
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.043
And in this fucking washhouse,

41:21.120 --> 41:22.963
did they tell you why I went there?

41:29.520 --> 41:32.888
You tell a soul in this family,

41:33.720 --> 41:37.202
and I swear I will cut you.

41:39.160 --> 41:43.324
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.489
It is a matter of honour.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.124
Look at this! Look.

42:09.480 --> 42:10.845
- I love it.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.441
Your Esme was right
about one thing,

42:13.520 --> 42:15.807
you can't beat the countryside.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.567
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day

42:21.120 --> 42:22.610
and keep chickens.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.322
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.480
- Oh, for fuck's sake!
-Take this.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.491
We need to bury him.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.164
Who the fuck is that?

42:39.560 --> 42:40.891
It's Irish business.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.201
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.286
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.725
John, grab his head.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.048
So, we're not really
going to London?

42:50.800 --> 42:52.290
Once we bury him,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.484
then the holiday begins.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.725
Much obliged.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.327
It's a fucking freak show.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.446
What the fuck is that racket?

43:55.520 --> 43:57.807
This is what they call music
these days, brother.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.041
Music?

44:16.320 --> 44:17.401
oi!

44:17.480 --> 44:19.926
Oi! Put it away.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.365
Fuck off!

44:26.280 --> 44:28.487
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

44:28.920 --> 44:30.570
It's all right, isn't it?

44:35.000 --> 44:37.480
Irish whiskey, a bottle.

44:38.160 --> 44:39.810
And hurry UP!

44:43.960 --> 44:45.530
Fucking hell,

44:45.600 --> 44:47.602
I recognise a few of these lads.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.769
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.211
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.722
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

44:58.800 --> 45:02.805
Just the lieutenants, john.
No sign of the officers.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.044
Right, let's line them up.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.086
Holiday!

45:11.400 --> 45:13.528
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.568
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.643
We just bought a fucking bottle.

45:18.720 --> 45:22.088
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.487
Yeah, we get that a lot.

45:24.560 --> 45:27.609
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

45:27.680 --> 45:29.569
without prior agreement.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.007
And what line would that be,
my friend?

45:33.200 --> 45:35.646
They say this is provocation.

45:37.280 --> 45:40.443
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.849
You're breaking the rules.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.809
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

45:49.120 --> 45:50.531
Peaky scum!

46:11.560 --> 46:15.690
Who the fuck's next?

46:19.120 --> 46:20.451
Come here!

46:28.920 --> 46:30.809
Put some ice on 'em!

46:34.880 --> 46:36.291
Get out.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.086
Yeah?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.851
Yeah?

46:45.200 --> 46:46.440
Are you going to use that?

46:51.240 --> 46:52.480
Didn't think so.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.402
We came here
not to make enemies.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.566
No.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.571
We came here to make new friends!

47:24.960 --> 47:27.167
Those of you who are last

47:27.720 --> 47:29.802
will soon be first.

47:33.560 --> 47:37.645
And those of you who are downtrodden
will rise up.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.806
Yup.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.209
You know where to find us.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.729
I think I've lost a tooth.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.646
I'll have none left at this rate!

47:57.800 --> 47:59.609
Some fucking holiday this is.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.923
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.480
- Here, this'll fix you.
-Give me that!

48:05.560 --> 48:07.847
- You, john boy, eh? How are you?

48:07.920 --> 48:10.491
- Or should I ask your fucking wife?
-Oh, give over!

48:10.560 --> 48:12.085
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

48:12.160 --> 48:13.844
--Fuck the chickens.

48:13.920 --> 48:15.649
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.085
Let's paint the town, eh?

48:19.360 --> 48:21.522
- Come.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.686
- Oh, dear God!
-Good Lord, I assumed

48:27.760 --> 48:29.524
it was Betty with tea.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.642
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

48:33.720 --> 48:36.963
No, because she takes lunch,
like normal people.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.487
And you can turn around,

48:38.560 --> 48:41.211
this lady is
a professional life model.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.884
She does this for a living.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.051
I... I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

48:47.120 --> 48:50.124
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the House. just, erm,

48:51.960 --> 48:54.486
keep your back turned,
if you must.

48:54.560 --> 48:55.925
Yes, sir.

48:59.200 --> 49:03.888
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

49:05.000 --> 49:08.288
Well, I... I...
I play cards on occasion.

49:08.360 --> 49:12.809
You're a stranger to cocaine and
exotic dancing, too, I would imagine.

49:13.160 --> 49:17.324
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

49:17.400 --> 49:22.247
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

49:22.920 --> 49:26.766
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

49:27.000 --> 49:29.048
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

49:29.120 --> 49:31.566
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.449
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

49:33.520 --> 49:36.524
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for...

49:37.520 --> 49:38.851
The bigger task.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.321
Expressions elude me,
I think too much.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.561
Sir?

49:42.880 --> 49:45.804
I need your authority

49:45.880 --> 49:48.690
to proceed with all urgency

49:49.200 --> 49:52.522
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

49:52.640 --> 49:55.211
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

49:55.640 --> 49:56.687
Yes, sir.

49:56.760 --> 50:00.048
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

50:01.480 --> 50:05.371
Well, to apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

50:05.440 --> 50:07.044
you have to know his weaknesses

50:07.120 --> 50:10.727
and I know this man's
weaknesses intimately.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.007
And after "mission accomplished",

50:13.080 --> 50:15.560
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

50:16.280 --> 50:18.009
Absolutely not, sir.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.761
So when he's served his purpose,

50:21.920 --> 50:23.684
he will be consigned to history

50:23.760 --> 50:25.967
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

50:26.040 --> 50:28.361
You mean at the end of a rope?

50:29.640 --> 50:32.689
Well, the end of the rope has
been this man's destiny

50:33.720 --> 50:35.688
since the night he was born.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.931
You're early.

51:07.280 --> 51:08.884
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

51:09.800 --> 51:10.801
What?

51:10.880 --> 51:13.884
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.080
Good. Now, come with me.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.685
No, shut your eyes!

51:20.080 --> 51:21.525
--This way.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.284
What are you doing, Tom?

51:23.360 --> 51:25.408
You've got to sit down
here. Right.

51:26.480 --> 51:30.530
--Sit down. Now, okay...

51:31.040 --> 51:32.804
- Type this.
-Why?

51:32.880 --> 51:34.325
Lizzie, type this.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.002
"If wi..."
Put your cigarette out.

51:37.960 --> 51:40.088
Right. "If winter comes...

51:40.400 --> 51:44.564
--"...then can spring be far behind?"

51:44.640 --> 51:48.008
Why?
Did you say spring?

51:48.080 --> 51:49.923
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

51:53.680 --> 51:54.966
Let's see.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.563
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

51:57.640 --> 51:58.971
Put in the question mark.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.764
Now type this.

52:01.840 --> 52:05.287
"Wanted, secretary
for expanding business."

52:05.360 --> 52:06.646
Slow down!

52:06.720 --> 52:09.644
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch type.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.210
"Five days a week.

52:12.280 --> 52:16.126
"Uh, eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.441
"Must be able to start immediately."

52:19.800 --> 52:21.086
Are you serious?

52:24.720 --> 52:26.722
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.930
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.441
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.241
All of it this time.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.531
No exceptions.

52:54.800 --> 52:57.724
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.881
Don't be late.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.524
Newmarket was profitable.

53:14.320 --> 53:16.687
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

53:17.840 --> 53:20.320
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

53:20.400 --> 53:21.606
he said you poured it away.

53:21.680 --> 53:24.160
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.162
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

53:27.240 --> 53:29.891
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

53:29.960 --> 53:33.248
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.368
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.489
- Stop fucking fighting me!
-Somebody has to.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.330
That arrived an hour ago.

53:41.400 --> 53:44.006
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.251
I was going to burn it.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.685
I should have.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.963
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

53:51.280 --> 53:53.362
Now you're at war with Sabini.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.446
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

54:35.520 --> 54:38.171
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.969
She goes mad if I'm late!

55:11.440 --> 55:13.568
- Ada Shelby?
-No.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.685
Your brother broke the rules.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.046
I don't have a fucking brother.

55:25.120 --> 55:27.600
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.284
- Let's go for a drive.
-No!

55:29.480 --> 55:31.323
- Hold her steady, boys.
-Don't! Get off!

55:43.520 --> 55:45.807
- Fucking hold him!

56:14.400 --> 56:18.564
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.962
I was at the races.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.771
Sabini.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.685
Don't say my name.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.170
Jesus!

56:29.560 --> 56:30.766
Franco,

56:31.400 --> 56:33.448
take my name out of his mouth.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.244
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

56:45.320 --> 56:46.526
Pay for the petrol.

57:02.280 --> 57:04.169
You see how much I know about you?

57:04.680 --> 57:07.843
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.523
Look at me.
Look at me!

57:11.480 --> 57:12.720
Look at me.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.203
You take up with the Jews.

57:16.280 --> 57:18.760
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.241
You can just come down,
pick a side.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.448
You fucking clown!

57:24.000 --> 57:25.968
Now your life is over.

57:26.640 --> 57:30.531
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.285
Your mistake.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.647
You remember that
when you get to hell.

57:40.200 --> 57:41.645
Finish him off.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.926
--You! Get back here!

58:09.120 --> 58:16.762
I suppose we should
see if the bastard's still alive.
