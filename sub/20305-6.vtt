00:01.001 --> 00:03.211
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.294 --> 00:04.629
Who's there?

00:06.089 --> 00:08.800
I thought it was a prowler!
He pointed a gun.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.719
Look, there's no question
we're gonna have to move on Perez.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.470
The point is, we've got a separate

00:12.554 --> 00:14.514
and legitimate endangerment
complaint against the mother.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.016
Take a little heat
off the department, right?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.143
-Is she free to leave?
-Not at this time.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.895
-You shot my boy.
-I'm sorry.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.607
I want some of your people, Frank,
undercover in one of those sex palaces.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.985
-I'm gonna hire cops?
-Four of us.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.611
Ozzie Cleveland's a real nice guy.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.905
I just don't see him
as the mayor of a city.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.700
You raided a porno supermarket
in Midtown this morning.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.869
It's a cheap, shoddy attempt
to put a feather

00:35.952 --> 00:37.954
in candidate Daniels' cap on election day.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.664
Maybe you'll let me
take you out to dinner.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.124
Oh, yeah?

00:41.458 --> 00:44.252
NARRATOR: <i>And now, tonight on</i>
Hill Street Blues...

00:45.837 --> 00:49.132
I took the heat off this department
and off Fletcher Daniels.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.383
I did what had to be done.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.551
Why are you telling me?

00:51.634 --> 00:52.927
<i>You let loose a hatchet man,</i>

00:53.011 --> 00:55.555
<i>and now you want to disavow</i>
<i>any responsibility.</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:58.808
<i>-You want it both ways!</i>
<i>-That is patently untrue.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:01.186
-Now, don't look at her, Nicky.
-NICKY: She keeps looking at me!

01:01.269 --> 01:03.021
Now, where's my stuff?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.441
Oh, Lord, I'm green!

01:08.777 --> 01:11.696
(people chattering)

01:11.780 --> 01:15.408
Item six, the Emily Post bandit,
Deedee, please.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.161
Said felon hit the Hill again yesterday,

01:18.244 --> 01:19.913
making a forced withdrawal

01:19.996 --> 01:23.041
from a savings and loan
on West 116th Street.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.670
Once again, witnesses remark
this perpetrator's impeccable manners.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.092
They were taken by his frequent use of,
"Yes, ma'am," and "No, ma'am,"

01:32.175 --> 01:35.595
while receiving the teller
of the cash drawer's contents.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.222
They were charmed

01:37.305 --> 01:40.266
by his keeping his hardware
directed at the floor.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.476
(laughter)

01:41.559 --> 01:44.145
Presumably, because
it's impolite to point,

01:44.229 --> 01:46.064
and by his apologies on departure

01:46.147 --> 01:48.525
for any inconvenience
he might have caused.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.318
A speculative tally

01:50.401 --> 01:52.487
would put the number of jobs
this gentleman's pulled

01:52.570 --> 01:54.489
at 27 in the last month.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.242
There is no reason his poly test

01:57.325 --> 02:00.161
ought to prompt
an equal deference from the police.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.539
Now, you've been given
a description sheet.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.542
Study it. Catch him.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.545
Item seven, detectives Duck, LaRue,
and Washington continue

02:08.628 --> 02:12.173
their mission of the infamous
and occasionally infectious

02:12.298 --> 02:15.176
8th Street porn palace,
Murray's Wonderland,

02:15.260 --> 02:18.138
to be rejoined later in
the a.m. by Lieutenant Hunter.

02:18.221 --> 02:22.016
Now, it is necessary for me to mention
that since this operation began,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.727
certain peculiar items
have surfaced about these premises.

02:24.811 --> 02:30.191
For example, this all-leather,
metal-studded headpiece.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.443
(cheering)

02:32.527 --> 02:34.988
Following considerable
open-minded speculation,

02:35.071 --> 02:37.907
it is not headgear for showering.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
(laughter)

02:40.076 --> 02:41.619
And this correctional device...

02:41.703 --> 02:43.997
(cheering)

02:44.080 --> 02:47.083
...is not a nontoxic,
nonpolluting roach killer.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.043
(laughter)

02:49.127 --> 02:51.838
Although, I admit, several of our roaches
have been naughty of late.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.716
(laughter)

02:54.799 --> 02:56.843
And this illustrated autobiography

02:56.926 --> 03:00.221
of 8-millimeter film
great Angela Anxious...

03:00.305 --> 03:02.265
(cheering)

03:02.348 --> 03:06.769
...entitled, <i>It Hurts, But I Love It.</i>

03:06.853 --> 03:09.397
(laughter)

03:09.480 --> 03:12.525
Not on the city library's
list of recommended reading.

03:14.110 --> 03:18.198
I ask the guilty party or parties
disseminating these souvenirs to cease

03:18.281 --> 03:20.909
or risk having his or her mind
washed out with soap

03:20.992 --> 03:23.369
by yours truly upstairs.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.625
Item eight is an update
on Officer Michael Perez.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.835
I'm afraid no visitors
are being allowed at this point.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.004
The address is posted upstairs.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.549
I'm sure we can all spare a few seconds
to drop a card or a note.

03:36.633 --> 03:40.970
You're all hereby apprised of two funds,
one for the Perez family,

03:41.054 --> 03:44.015
as you know, they were feeling the pinch
prior to this situation,

03:44.098 --> 03:48.228
and the other to aid Mrs. Doris Robson,
with funeral expenses for her son.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.356
Officer Schnitz is taking the donations.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.025
Item last...

03:55.151 --> 03:57.445
Now, it's one more day till the election.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.822
It's been my personal observation

03:59.906 --> 04:04.202
that the topic has been a source
of heated hallway debate.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.872
Now, debate is healthy,
but let's keep it amiable.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.874
Let's give our fellow grown-ups a chance

04:09.958 --> 04:12.502
to make an uncoerced,
well-thought-out decision.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.088
Okay, that's it. Let's roll.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.717
And let's be very careful out there.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.274
I think I ought to go by and see Maria.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.234
Just to let her know
we're thinking about Mike.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.027
Say, Leo, you got change for a $20?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.737
-Ten each, please.
-Thank you.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.073
-(sighs)
-BOBBY: Give me the classified section.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.242
Those stairs are murder.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.662
-When's he checking you out?
-This afternoon.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.373
What's the idiot grin for?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.876
You're not making excuses to see
your squeeze, are you, Luce?

04:53.960 --> 04:56.838
I don't have to make excuses.
We have a date tonight.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.090
And the sergeant
threw this away for a reason.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.801
-I was gonna throw it back.
-Mm-hm. Sure you were.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.345
How can she do that?

05:05.096 --> 05:07.640
-Tongue depressors.
-Ooh. Ah.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.853
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

05:11.936 --> 05:13.646
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:17.650
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.277
(sirens wailing)

05:24.741 --> 05:28.661
(theme music playing)

06:38.439 --> 06:40.149
Will you take care of this, please?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.026
It's not unusual.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.070
New candidates generate new interest.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.739
-Ray, morning.
-Good morning.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.117
FLETCHER: Mr. Whitcamp would like
to use the computer facilities

06:49.200 --> 06:50.660
for a few minutes,
if it's all right with you.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.245
Yeah, I need the phone link
at the division.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.371
Go right ahead.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.667
Well, Ramon, gonna watch the debate?

06:58.334 --> 06:59.502
Yes, Chief.

07:00.169 --> 07:03.214
Ray, I'm sorry about
our harsh words the other day.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.674
I know you've got a shopping list.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.009
It is not a shopping list.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.305
A legitimate agenda, then,
things you want for your constituency.

07:11.639 --> 07:12.890
My people, Chief.

07:12.974 --> 07:16.018
-I am not running for office.
-Your people, then.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.188
Ray, what I'm trying to say
is I'll listen.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.358
I just can't give you
specifics at this time.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.861
What I can offer you

07:25.528 --> 07:28.156
is a ride to the debate in my limo.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.157
Limo?

07:29.657 --> 07:32.618
I'm taking my best campaigners
by chauffeured limousine.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.288
When we're there,
I want you in the front row.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.874
I need to know you're on the team, Ray.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.668
I'm sorry, Chief.
I can no longer promise that.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.380
Then I may have to break
a promise of my own.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.717
If that costs me my captaincy, so be it.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.303
So, Ozzie Cleveland got to you, did he?

07:50.386 --> 07:53.097
No one got to me, not Cleveland, not you.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.849
I just have to think.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.143
Give my seat to someone else.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.522
Chief, I think you should be
in on the status session

08:01.606 --> 08:03.691
with Deputy Chief Mahoney
about the Robson shooting.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.068
I'm a little rushed for time
this morning, Frank.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.570
You and Dennis handle it.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.157
Gonna get me a bust at that
porn palace by 4:00, Frank?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.325
That's our plan.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.704
-Well?
-Cleveland's up.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.499
Three points in Winchester,
five points in Eastlake,

08:19.582 --> 08:20.750
three points in the River District,

08:20.833 --> 08:23.169
-and as for the Black communities--
-Let me see that.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.131
Unbelievable. It's a horse race.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.800
I mean,
he isn't really even organized yet.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.553
My hunch is, you know,
people just like the guy.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.555
Morning, Chief, Frank.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.141
Don't ever run for office, Dennis.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.021
I'm an isolated man locked inside
an electronic Tower of Babel.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.940
We're holding the fort, Chief.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.775
Let's go, Frank.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.570
There's definitely enough
to hold this Robson woman

08:49.654 --> 08:51.614
for the grand jury,
don't you think so, Frank?

08:51.697 --> 08:52.865
No, I don't.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.617
You think they'll dismiss?

08:56.827 --> 08:57.787
I think they should.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.166
Well, even if they do...

09:02.917 --> 09:05.002
even if they do,
we got the word out on that woman.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.964
We got the story out.
That child was left alone.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.799
Who are you trying to convince, Dennis?

09:10.424 --> 09:14.053
I took the heat off this department
and off Fletcher Daniels.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.430
-I did what had to be done.
-Why are you telling me?

09:16.514 --> 09:19.517
Because I know I'm right.
I know that's what he wanted to do.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.394
You're probably close there.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.771
I think he wanted it done.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.736
(door opens)

09:45.376 --> 09:46.377
May I help you?

09:47.962 --> 09:49.547
I know where somebody is.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.633
Who?

09:59.765 --> 10:02.059
Yeah, well, I got to be
sure of some things first.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.353
Don't arrest me.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.564
Arrest me, and I don't tell you anything.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.775
And I want a methadone program
today, right now.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.111
You promise me or I don't say anything.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.946
What's your name, miss?

10:15.156 --> 10:18.075
Desiree... Desiree Handel.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.453
Well, it's like this, Desiree.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.372
Unless you give us some idea
about who this somebody is,

10:23.456 --> 10:24.915
we can't do anything for you.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.714
The Emily Post bandit,
you talk about him on TV.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.760
You tell us where we can find him,
I'll see you get in a program.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.262
Today, no screwing around.

10:39.388 --> 10:42.141
And I want a lawyer to make sure
you guys do like you promise.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.267
That, too.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.645
He's a junkie, he...

10:46.103 --> 10:49.774
He has to get high this afternoon,
so he's doing a bank this morning.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.067
What's his name? What bank?

10:52.818 --> 10:53.653
Nicky...

10:56.447 --> 10:57.823
Nicky Kasner.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.159
He said the bank on Jefferson.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.120
-There's four on Jefferson. Which one?
-I don't know. Uh...

11:04.497 --> 11:05.998
One he did before.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.460
Hey, where's my lawyer?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.295
-Four units to Jefferson?
-Please.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.426
This guy...

11:18.344 --> 11:20.096
some prior relationship to you?

11:20.179 --> 11:21.514
He stinks, that's all.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.766
We're through.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.853
I can only take so much.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.529
Hey, I give you a five,
you give me change for a one?

11:36.612 --> 11:38.698
-What's that?
-(growls)

11:38.781 --> 11:40.616
All right, all right,
all right, lighten up.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.577
Don't you feed this guy?

11:48.499 --> 11:49.500
I've been watching you, kid.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.252
You got a real flair
for this type of work.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.337
-You ever think of quitting the cops?
-No.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.631
Too bad. You can make
a buck in this racket.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.218
-I could teach you the business.
-I'm not interested.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.469
Hey, wait a minute.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.805
Tell me something.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.350
What's the worst pain in the world?

12:06.434 --> 12:10.146
What's the absolute worst thing
a human being can be made to suffer?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.524
I don't know, Murray. Uh, torture.

12:13.941 --> 12:14.984
Loneliness.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.028
Murray's combats loneliness.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.158
So do churches, Murray. So do ballgames.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.785
So do libraries and social clubs.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.287
And so does Murray's.

12:26.662 --> 12:30.207
Granted, Murray's takes a slightly
different angle, but...

12:30.291 --> 12:33.169
Excuse me.
Where's Murray's Animal Kingdom?

12:33.252 --> 12:36.964
Renamed "Murray's World
of Alternative Lifestyles," third floor.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.340
Thanks.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.178
Maybe you're one of the lucky ones
with a wife and kids to go home to.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.429
A lot of people got nothing.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.306
They go to a little room every night,

12:46.015 --> 12:47.850
and eat a frozen dinner, and watch TV.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.895
All the while, they're crying inside
for somebody to love them.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.899
Me, I try to give them something
to hold onto in the dark.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.527
Murray, I got to tell you,
that's very poetic.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.905
I don't know.
Maybe you're an all right guy.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.282
But what you got here, Murray,

13:04.325 --> 13:05.201
this ain't right.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.746
Kid, to each his own. (mumbles)

13:09.497 --> 13:13.375
Murray wants everybody to be happy,
irregardless of what that involves.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.085
It's a wonderful world.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.420
(Mick laughs)

13:18.380 --> 13:19.256
Whoa, hey!

13:19.799 --> 13:22.885
Quincy gonna know. He can read my eyes.
He knows when I'm scared.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.930
Look, maybe he's got you believing that,
but it ain't true.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.516
Now, it's gonna work.
We're gonna bust that sucker clean.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.726
Hey, hey, hey. Look.
She's just a little hinky, babe.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.020
Oh, yeah, sure. Come on,
let's get her downstairs for some air.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.939
Hey, haven't you ever heard
of the Hill Street battle cry?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.607
"Never fear, J.D.'s here."

13:39.860 --> 13:41.987
Seems pretty copacetic to me.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.114
Just watch your driving, Robert.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.576
I'm perfectly capable of scoping
this situation out by myself.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.703
Excuse me, Sherlock.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.289
Take a right here, go by First Citizens.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.710
Looks like we're gonna spend
this entire day

13:56.794 --> 13:58.963
just driving around
in a car doing nothing.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.798
Since when did that matter to you?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.178
What's this here?

14:07.596 --> 14:09.473
(siren wailing)

14:09.557 --> 14:11.141
Jefferson pursuing robbery suspect on...

14:12.560 --> 14:14.019
Hey, come on. Come here!

14:24.572 --> 14:26.699
Okay, hey, come on, I'm cool.
I'm cool, don't hurt me.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.076
-Hey, Renko!
-Don't worry, partner.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.286
I got it.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.621
BOBBY:
I said get up on your feet right now!

14:33.414 --> 14:34.373
Come on!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.168
Put your hands behind your back.
Spread your legs.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.299
Oh, Lord, I'm green!

14:46.093 --> 14:47.636
Leo, one Emily Post robber.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.680
LEO: Bill and Renko, collar of the day.

14:49.763 --> 14:52.683
Yeah. And one pile of holdup money.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.269
Leo, be careful with it.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.230
Booby-trapped, huh?

14:58.939 --> 15:01.191
How come it's all over Renko
instead of him?

15:01.275 --> 15:04.528
Why don't you mind your beeswax, Leo?
Let's book him.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.659
Whoa, whoa. My goodness.
You're greener today.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.578
You're using too much fertilizer, Andy.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.371
-I'm telling you.
-What you laughing about?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.332
-Who, me? I'm not laughing.
-You're laughing.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.209
I need someone to take
a customer over to county

15:19.293 --> 15:20.461
for methadone treatment.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.712
We're going anyway.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.134
She told you, didn't she?

15:27.468 --> 15:30.763
I have not got the slightest idea
who you're talking about, bud.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.556
Dye got me first time, too, man.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.559
You sniff it when it's wet,
you get a little high.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.936
Is that so?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.520
Perhaps you could enlighten me

15:38.604 --> 15:40.689
and tell me how I can
get this dye off of me.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.733
-Turpentine.
-Turpentine.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.194
-It's primo, man.
-Excuse me.

15:45.277 --> 15:49.823
-I got to go and take care of this now.
-Let's do some fingerprints.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.200
Yes!

15:51.283 --> 15:54.662
We did something like that
on LARP in the delta.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.415
It matched the sunlight
coming through... (mumbles)

15:58.499 --> 16:01.835
BOBBY: Toes on the line
and face forward. Let's go.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.589
Hey, you work your side
of the fence, I work mine.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.341
Just dig it.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.927
No reason for everybody to hate everybody.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.346
As long as you get your junk, right, Nick?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.641
Hey, I'm not asking
for the state of Montana.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.727
-He's been advised?
-Yep.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.815
The Emily Post bandit.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.402
-Say something polite, Nicky.
-Come on. Give me a break.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.656
-You had a heck of a run.
-Hey, look, I'm sorry.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.200
I mean, I didn't mean to
make you guys look like jerks.

16:34.451 --> 16:35.452
Uh, look...

16:36.245 --> 16:39.456
I was telling the arresting officer,
my problem is

16:40.207 --> 16:42.376
I'm gonna need to get fixed pretty soon.

16:42.459 --> 16:46.880
Federated Bank
on 25th Street, Nicky, October 21st.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.134
That girlfriend of mine.
Can you believe that?

16:50.342 --> 16:54.346
I mean, what's in it for her?
She goes and does something like that.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.726
How about
the Certified National Bank on Utica,

16:58.809 --> 17:00.644
October 10th, know anything about that?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.938
I'm gonna need to get fixed, man.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.816
You don't know anything about
the Certified National Bank?

17:05.899 --> 17:07.484
Look, Officer, Detective,

17:08.235 --> 17:10.112
you got the pictures, you figure it out.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.448
What am I gonna do, lie to you?

17:12.531 --> 17:15.659
I got a $700-a-day habit,
and I support her, too.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.287
-By robbery?
-No, by selling pencils.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.414
Hey...

17:21.248 --> 17:23.000
I never harmed anybody, right?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.210
I mean, hell,

17:26.086 --> 17:28.422
I would walk in, and I'd be so nice,

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
people couldn't give me
enough of their money.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.845
(chuckling) There was this one time,
there was this one time,

17:34.928 --> 17:37.556
this broad was so happy
I wasn't gonna shoot her,

17:37.639 --> 17:41.602
she reached into the other drawer,
and she gave me that money, too.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.520
Can you believe that?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.357
I told Desiree about it.

17:48.984 --> 17:53.822
We got high, and she sat in the car
and watched me do a liquor store.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.990
What liquor store?

17:55.949 --> 17:58.368
It's true what they say
about love, man, it stinks.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.703
What liquor store?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.998
Hey, look, Detective,
I'm obviously talking here,

18:03.082 --> 18:04.708
so give me a little rhythm, right?

18:05.667 --> 18:08.545
I'm gonna need to get fixed
the next few hours, all right?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.467
-Put him on the bus.
-Um, hey, Detective...

18:13.550 --> 18:15.844
I mean, so you had a bad morning.
I can relate to that.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.180
I mean, look at the morning I've had.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.355
Sorry. I'm not gonna fix you, Nicky.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.950
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Post.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.996
I have tried industrial dye,
and I have tried turpentine, and I--

18:43.080 --> 18:45.457
You gotta use pumice stone
with turpentine.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.209
I don't think you get the idea.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.462
You see, apparently, this dye
has gone through my uniform

18:50.546 --> 18:53.173
and discolored certain
portions of my underneath.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.424
Now, if you could find something

18:54.508 --> 18:56.718
that might be a little milder on me,
a little less--

18:56.802 --> 18:59.847
Hey, you know, maybe there is,
but I just don't know what it is.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.098
-I'm sorry--
-You better start--

19:01.181 --> 19:02.474
Are you out of your mind, Renko?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.101
Look at me, man! Look at me!

19:08.772 --> 19:11.400
Nicky... Nicky, I'm sorry.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.403
You said you loved me,
and now you go do something like this.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.613
I do love you, Nicky. I'm sick.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.783
You left me. You left me too long.
You were playing with me.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.578
I loved you, and now you go
do something like this.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.872
My client was promised that she'd be taken
to county right away.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.000
-We're on top of it. Coffey, Bates.
-I was sick!

19:28.083 --> 19:30.335
-You left me two days!
-All right.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.800
Well, she's on the mend.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.344
Hey, can you do something
about her disposition?

19:39.428 --> 19:42.306
Shut up, Joe. Where's Desiree?

19:42.389 --> 19:45.309
They're gonna keep her here.
She has an abscess or something.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.561
-I'll see you tonight.
-Okay.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.605
Hey, where you taking her?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.316
-I mean, does this guy spring or what?
-Shut up, Joe.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.735
I'll submit a list for your approval.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.239
-He's nice.
-So you like him, huh?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.116
What did I just say?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.411
Do me a favor, button this up. Uh! Gotcha!

20:06.413 --> 20:08.874
IRWIN: And so, based on evidence
before the court, Your Honor,

20:08.957 --> 20:11.460
the People believe
there is enough to warrant

20:11.543 --> 20:13.587
holding Miss Robson for the grand jury.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.800
Mr. District Attorney,
three days ago, I recalled telling you

20:18.884 --> 20:20.677
that when we got to
the particulars of this case,

20:20.761 --> 20:22.763
you better show me something of substance.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.974
What you've presented here
leads me to conclude

20:26.058 --> 20:28.518
that your prosecution of this woman

20:28.602 --> 20:31.271
is nothing more than an attempt
to protect this city

20:31.355 --> 20:33.982
from a potentially expensive civil action.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.443
Sir, I find that outrageous.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.903
I am appalled.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.657
Defendant, please rise.

20:44.534 --> 20:48.080
Charge of felony
child endangerment, dismissed.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.668
Charge of child abandonment, dismissed.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.505
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.466
JUDGE: As for the individuals
in the police department,

20:59.549 --> 21:02.052
the DA's office involved in this action,

21:02.761 --> 21:06.682
I regret I'm not in power
to sentence you to a little humanity.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.769
-(gavel bangs)
-Recess ten minutes.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.567
(indistinct chattering)

21:17.651 --> 21:19.403
WOMAN: Could you hold
the elevator, please?

21:19.486 --> 21:21.321
There will be a lot of press outside.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.198
If you like, we can try and go around.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.366
It doesn't matter.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.953
Doris, there's nothing preventing you
bringing suit against the city.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.123
And there's every reason
at this point to say you should.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.083
You'd be my lawyer?

21:33.166 --> 21:34.543
I'm afraid I'm not allowed,

21:34.626 --> 21:36.712
but I'll give you names
of some very good people.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.046
If they don't pan out,

21:38.547 --> 21:39.881
I'll give you a few myself.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.764
Hey. How you doing?

21:48.932 --> 21:49.891
Huh? Come here.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.727
Yeah, you look like you're doing good.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.230
-I'm fine.
-That's swell. You take it easy, okay?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.191
(sighs)

21:59.651 --> 22:00.777
Quincy's taking his time.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.447
She's getting ready
to climb into a basket.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.742
-Excuse me. Uh, Murray?
-Upstairs, third floor.

22:06.825 --> 22:11.455
No, no, he's not in his office.
That's all right. I'll find him. Thanks.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.624
-Was that--
-(both laughing)

22:14.708 --> 22:18.128
No, no, no, no. Man, this is too good.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.296
Ho, ho.

22:25.093 --> 22:25.927
Al!

22:26.887 --> 22:31.099
-Hey, Al.
-John. How nice to see you.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.269
-You look great.
-You look great yourself.

22:34.811 --> 22:38.690
So, uh, been keeping busy?

22:39.858 --> 22:43.195
I think you know that I was suspended
from law practice for six months.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.073
Yeah, yeah. I, uh, I heard.

22:46.573 --> 22:50.243
-John, it was a blessing.
-Hey, that's great.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.412
I had never been so depressed
in my whole life.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.415
I was--
I was actually contemplating suicide.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.294
And then with the help
of a tremendously sensitive

22:59.378 --> 23:04.132
and caring therapist, I began to rethink
the fundamental assumptions of my life.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.511
-No kidding?
-You see, my therapist told me

23:07.594 --> 23:09.471
I had to go back to my early childhood,

23:09.554 --> 23:14.476
act out my gender confusions
so I can redefine my masculinity.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.353
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In a dress?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.688
This is not a flirtation
with a gay lifestyle, John.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.524
-I wanna stress that.
-Oh, hey.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.733
-Okay?
-Sure.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.903
No. My therapist
says this is just a phase.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.656
And we have to crawl before we can walk.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.035
Your... your therapist work here?

23:32.828 --> 23:35.163
No. No, I'm here on business.
The owner's a client.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.748
-Murray?
-Yeah.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.500
You guys have put him in
a rather ticklish situation.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.919
He wants a little help
in the legal rapids.

23:41.711 --> 23:45.924
-Gotta go. Hey, great-great seeing you.
-Oh, it's great seeing you, John.

23:46.007 --> 23:46.842
Uh, look...

23:48.802 --> 23:51.054
I'm back in circulation
if-if you need an attorney.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.307
Top of my list, Al. Huh?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.963
(indistinct chattering)

24:28.091 --> 24:29.968
You don't open this. You don't even talk.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.680
-Bus get there, he be waiting, got that?
-Police, suckers! Don't move!

24:34.264 --> 24:35.432
J.D.!

24:36.016 --> 24:37.392
Watch it, J.D.! Watch it!

24:38.727 --> 24:39.686
-Freeze!
-Get 'em, Neal!

24:39.769 --> 24:43.231
Move! Move! Move!

24:45.567 --> 24:46.985
HUNTER:
The other way, the other way, Mick!

24:50.155 --> 24:52.574
-(woman screams)
-You ain't goin' nowhere!

24:54.201 --> 24:56.953
-Murray, get down! Get down!
-Freeze!

24:58.121 --> 24:59.664
(women scream)

25:00.916 --> 25:02.542
-Neal!
-I'm okay.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.253
-Backups are on the way.
-Keep him on the floor.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.132
-Cuff him, Neal!
-Come on! Come on!

25:09.216 --> 25:12.844
-(groans) I been shot.
-Good!

25:15.347 --> 25:20.936
-Hey, kid. Give me a hand here, will ya?
-Take it easy, Murray. Take it easy.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.522
NEAL: Come on, get up! Get up!

25:23.939 --> 25:26.066
-I'm short of breath.
-Don't move.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.777
You're gonna be okay.
Ambulance is on its way.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.362
MURRAY: This is gonna cost me.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.156
-(gasps)
-MAN: That's it.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.450
J.D.: Come on. There's the door. Let's go.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.537
-I'm cut!
-J.D.: Move!

25:40.121 --> 25:41.915
(clears throat) Hell...

25:43.667 --> 25:47.254
replace the glass and this--
these cases...

25:48.255 --> 25:49.881
Seven...

25:50.840 --> 25:53.051
Three hundred bucks without labor.

25:55.512 --> 25:58.306
-You're covered, Mur.
-(laughs)

25:59.558 --> 26:02.394
Al? Is that you?

26:03.103 --> 26:04.104
Yeah.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.147
You look good.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.192
(breathes heavily)

26:10.402 --> 26:12.445
What a business. (gasps)

26:26.585 --> 26:28.420
We're all set up.
Now, I think you can safely say

26:28.503 --> 26:31.256
it has a street value of $2.5 million.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.675
-What?
-What's the problem, Detective?

26:33.758 --> 26:34.884
It's just a kilo, Chief.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.304
Step on it five times,
and it's still only worth half a million.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.265
-Damn it! Somebody give me a number.
-Say a million.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.395
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll begin with a statement.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.355
Operation Pit Bull,

26:47.439 --> 26:49.733
our long-standing undercover investigation

26:49.816 --> 26:52.152
of drug transactions
in the pornographic trade

26:52.235 --> 26:54.738
has today netted spectacular results.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.866
We've broken a major drug ring
and netted a quantity of heroin

26:57.949 --> 26:59.784
with an estimated street value

26:59.868 --> 27:02.746
of well in excess
of one-and-a-quarter million dollars.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.456
I'd like to specifically commend

27:04.539 --> 27:08.251
the work of Detective Sergeant
Neal Washington,

27:08.877 --> 27:12.922
under whose leadership Operation Pit Bull
racked up such impressive returns.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.426
Truly one of this department's
and this city's finest.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.179
-(camera shutter clicks)
-WOMAN: Shake hands again.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.223
-(chattering)
-You and me were there, weren't we?

27:22.682 --> 27:23.892
Must have been exciting.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.644
MAN: How long was the operation--

27:25.727 --> 27:28.063
MAN 2: What's the word
on the death of Murray--

27:28.521 --> 27:30.315
-(chattering)
-Fay, how nice to see you.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.359
Chief, how about kissing the baby, Chief?

27:32.442 --> 27:36.196
Well, surely. Here, come on.
If I remember how to do this.

27:37.364 --> 27:41.201
-Little fella.
-Excuse me, please.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.995
-What's your name, ma'am?
-Fay Furillo,

27:44.079 --> 27:46.081
and this is Catherine Elizabeth Furillo.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.749
Are you Captain Furillo's wife?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.959
Oh, no. We've been divorced for some time.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.170
She weighs seven pounds,
seven ounces soaking wet,

27:52.253 --> 27:53.380
and she's healthy as a horse.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.589
-MAN: She's beautiful.
-FAY: Thank you.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.509
-Who's the lucky father?
-Judge Paul Grogan.

27:58.218 --> 28:02.389
-Secret marriage?
-I'm a single mother and proud of it.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.015
Fay, I'm running a little late.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.268
Chief, what's your position
on city aid to unwed mothers?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.646
Well, certainly we support
the notion of motherhood.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.940
-Fay, I'm running a little late.
-Wait a minute.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.817
Let me tell you something, mister.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.362
This city's position on aid
to single mothers stinks.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.116
I mean, have you any idea
what an unwed mother has to go through?

28:21.199 --> 28:23.076
And the frustration of being shunted

28:23.159 --> 28:27.580
from one agency to the other
like-like meat in a sausage factory?

28:27.664 --> 28:30.709
I think it's time that somebody
paid some attention.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.044
Fay, not now. Please.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.381
When then?

28:37.507 --> 28:40.635
I mean, when is this city
gonna come out of the Dark Ages?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.930
And when are we gonna get
an enlightened administration

28:44.013 --> 28:48.101
willing to come out
for simple human rights for all women,

28:48.184 --> 28:49.269
single or otherwise?

28:49.352 --> 28:52.981
Fay, these are substantive questions,
which I intend to address.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.358
Unfortunately,
the time allotted to candidates

28:55.442 --> 28:58.403
rarely permits a personal reply.
Excuse me.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.740
MAN: Chief, how large
was this narcotics ring?

29:01.823 --> 29:03.992
(reporters clamoring)

29:07.162 --> 29:09.998
Oh, you look like a boiled lobster, son.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.542
Bobby, I have mutilated myself.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.879
I have removed most of the skin
from my southern half.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.298
Is it-- is it still green?

29:18.548 --> 29:21.509
No, it's sort of, like, bright red now.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.887
I'm never gonna be the same man again.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.640
Well, come on. I'll race you to the car.
(laughing)

29:29.142 --> 29:31.895
-This is all going downtown, Leo.
-Right.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.773
Nice bust, Detective.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.484
A citizen got killed, sir.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.819
I thought it was just that porno operator.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.489
Well, he was a citizen.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.326
Our work isn't often neat.
Sometimes people get hurt.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.453
-Will you excuse me, sir, please?
-In a minute.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.079
I want to mend a fence with you.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.582
Hey, if the chief gets elected,

29:52.665 --> 29:54.542
there's a good chance
you'll be calling me "boss."

29:54.626 --> 29:55.543
No, sir.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.420
What? Sorry, I--

29:57.504 --> 30:00.548
If you become chief,
that's when I start looking for a new job.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.092
-Now, hold on...
-Please listen to me, sir.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.969
I've seen the way you've tried to hurt
people up here,

30:05.053 --> 30:06.179
and I'll tell you the truth.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.556
I'd rather work for the guy
who ran that sleaze joint,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.517
and I already turned that job down.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.061
Now, please. Excuse me, sir.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.026
DANIELS (on TV): <i>My figures indicate</i>
<i>the completed pavilion</i>

30:20.109 --> 30:23.738
<i>will pump $25 million</i>
<i>into our local economy.</i>

30:23.822 --> 30:25.406
Giving points for slick, Howard?

30:26.407 --> 30:29.244
Carriage and grooming, Henry,
the facts of electronic life.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.704
DANIELS (on TV):
<i>...no later than this time next year.</i>

30:32.705 --> 30:33.623
MAN (on TV): <i>Commander Cleveland?</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:36.584
(clears throat)
<i>I'm afraid I'm not up to date</i>

30:36.668 --> 30:39.337
<i>on the figures concerning the pavilion.</i>

30:40.463 --> 30:42.340
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't have time.</i>

30:42.841 --> 30:45.218
<i>If it brings jobs, I'm for it.</i>

30:45.301 --> 30:46.636
Pretty vague.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.972
MAN (on TV):
<i>...from Kirk Robertson of</i> The Herald.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.224
<i>May we have your reactions</i>
<i>to the shooting</i>

30:51.307 --> 30:54.352
<i>of five-year-old Jimmy Robson</i>
<i>by a police officer?</i>

30:54.602 --> 30:57.689
<i>Specifically, to the department's</i>
<i>handling of the officer involved</i>

30:57.772 --> 31:00.441
<i>and the bringing charges</i>
<i>against the dead boy's mother.</i>

31:00.775 --> 31:01.693
FLETCHER: <i>Certainly.</i>

31:02.819 --> 31:06.281
<i>The Internal Affairs investigation</i>
<i>of Officer Perez is ongoing.</i>

31:06.781 --> 31:08.616
<i>Their findings are due within the week.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:11.536
<i>Pending those, any comment</i>
<i>by me would be premature.</i>

31:12.620 --> 31:14.914
<i>As for the charges against Mrs. Robson,</i>

31:15.415 --> 31:17.667
<i>I would like to read a copy</i>
<i>of a letter, for the record,</i>

31:17.750 --> 31:21.004
<i>sent to Judge Oberman's</i>
<i>Superior Court yesterday morning.</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:22.797
<i>"Dear sir,</i>

31:23.590 --> 31:26.217
<i>occupied as I have been</i>
<i>with the current campaign,</i>

31:26.759 --> 31:29.304
<i>I've had to delegate</i>
<i>many day-to-day responsibilities</i>

31:29.387 --> 31:30.471
<i>of the department.</i>

31:30.930 --> 31:33.725
<i>Without second-guessing the judgment</i>
<i>of those who brought them,</i>

31:33.808 --> 31:37.645
<i>please note that the pursuance</i>
<i>of the charges against Mrs. Doris Robson</i>

31:40.356 --> 31:42.483
<i>I personally abhor this action</i>

31:42.567 --> 31:45.445
<i>and hope this will be a factor</i>
<i>in your deliberations.</i>

31:45.528 --> 31:47.864
<i>The city of which I would</i>
<i>like to be mayor</i>

31:48.323 --> 31:51.743
<i>would not bring charges</i>
<i>against a Doris Robson.</i>

31:52.201 --> 31:54.579
<i>Sincerely, Fletcher Daniels."</i>

31:55.038 --> 31:56.664
<i>Did you or did you not before the debate,</i>

31:56.748 --> 31:59.208
<i>ask me not to politicize</i>
<i>the Robson shooting?</i>

31:59.667 --> 32:02.253
FLETCHER: <i>A tragedy</i>
<i>of this magnitude transcends--</i>

32:02.337 --> 32:05.715
<i>Did you or did you not</i>
<i>apprise me of that letter before now?</i>

32:05.798 --> 32:07.717
<i>I didn't see it as necessarily germane--</i>

32:07.800 --> 32:10.678
<i>What purpose does making</i>
<i>that letter public serve you now?</i>

32:12.055 --> 32:15.350
<i>On an issue as sensitive as this,</i>
<i>the public has the right to know--</i>

32:15.433 --> 32:17.602
CLEVELAND:
<i>I saw you at the Hill Street Station</i>

32:17.685 --> 32:21.064
<i>when the decision was made</i>
<i>to pursue that charge, Chief Daniels.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:23.900
FLETCHER: <i>Now, just a minute, Ozzie.</i>
<i>Are you calling me a liar?</i>

32:23.983 --> 32:26.986
<i>Call it what you like. It's clear.</i>

32:27.070 --> 32:29.489
<i>You let loose the hatchet man</i>
<i>and now you want to disavow</i>

32:29.572 --> 32:30.949
<i>any responsibility.</i>

32:31.324 --> 32:33.910
<i>-You want it both ways.</i>
<i>-That is patently untrue.</i>

32:33.993 --> 32:35.495
CLEVELAND:
<i>You didn't keep your word, Fletcher.</i>

32:35.578 --> 32:36.955
<i>A woman lost her son,</i>

32:37.747 --> 32:41.793
<i>a policeman's life and career</i>
<i>are irretrievably damaged.</i>

32:42.293 --> 32:46.839
<i>And the public deserves better from us</i>
<i>than pious, self-serving rationalization</i>

32:46.923 --> 32:48.800
<i>at the expense of innocent lives.</i>

32:49.300 --> 32:52.595
<i>I have no quarrel with that.</i>
<i>I was simply...</i>

32:53.763 --> 32:56.015
<i>I was trying to indicate my position.</i>

32:56.099 --> 32:59.018
I'll have to give Cleveland
that round on points.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.021
That was no decision, Howard.
That was a knockout.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.275
JUDGE: It is the decision of this court

33:06.359 --> 33:09.028
that Mr. Donald Quincy
be detained without bail.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.865
Return date to superior court
will be in one week.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.575
-(gavel bangs)
-Bailiff...

33:15.368 --> 33:17.996
BAILIFF: Docket number 199436.

33:18.079 --> 33:22.959
Nicholas Kasner, 22 counts of 1605,
robbery in the first degree.

33:23.876 --> 33:28.006
Mr. Kasner is allegedly
the Emily Post robber, Your Honor.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.633
If you're thinking murder two
on Quincy and Masters,

33:30.717 --> 33:32.218
you're whistling downwind.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.181
See, you want to get them to cop
to a manslaughter, simple possession,

33:37.265 --> 33:39.100
you'll get the same eight to ten
they're gonna serve anyway.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.731
BAILIFF: Case is on for bail setting.
Defendant is indigent.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.649
Representation
by public defender's office.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.360
Alan? Alan Wachtel?

33:50.028 --> 33:52.947
Representing the estate
of the late Murray Kaplan.

33:55.491 --> 33:56.451
Sorry, Alan.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.745
I'm not tossing the criminal charges

33:58.828 --> 34:01.581
just so you can begin
pursuing us in civil court.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.291
Excuse me, do I have to point out

34:03.374 --> 34:06.335
to you that Murray Kaplan
died a hero for this city?

34:06.419 --> 34:10.757
Is this the gratitude he gets, hm?
Pauperism for his wife and his children?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.300
-Irwin.
-You're in my way.

34:12.383 --> 34:13.593
-Al, come on, huh?
-(gavel bangs)

34:13.676 --> 34:16.471
Excuse me. What's the problem here?

34:19.098 --> 34:20.433
There's no problem, Your Honor.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.853
-Counselor Wachtel?
-Yes, sir.

34:25.396 --> 34:28.024
-It's good to see you back in court.
-Thank you, sir.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.903
If you've got a moment,
I'd like to see you in chambers.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.071
Certainly.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.324
See to the heart of things, Irwin.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.077
See what would have been best
for Murray Kaplan.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.953
Okay, come on, come on.

34:42.538 --> 34:44.248
(grunting)

34:45.958 --> 34:46.959
(screaming)

34:47.877 --> 34:50.421
-So you really liked him, huh?
-Yeah.

34:52.256 --> 34:56.260
Well... Stuart. Stu.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.888
He's a nice guy.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.308
I gotta tell you I was worried that...

35:03.351 --> 35:05.561
I don't know, that you would
give me a hard time.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.773
I don't even give you
the benefit of the doubt.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.692
You know something?
I think you're really coming along.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.737
I mean, I think you're really
developing a sense of warmth.

35:17.907 --> 35:18.908
Something wrong, Joe?

35:19.659 --> 35:20.535
Uh-uh.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.162
So then why you sitting there
like you got a broken neck?

35:23.246 --> 35:25.873
You know those little black spots
that float around in your eye,

35:25.957 --> 35:29.418
and no matter how hard you try,
you can never look at one?

35:29.836 --> 35:30.670
Yeah.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.549
Well, I got one balanced
right in the middle,

35:34.632 --> 35:35.967
and I'm looking right at it.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.761
That's great, Joe. That's really good.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.596
Maybe the sergeant
should put this in roll call.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.597
It's good.

35:41.889 --> 35:44.308
WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units,</i>
<i>vicinity Holyoake and Jefferson.</i>

35:44.392 --> 35:46.727
<i>You have a 417, escaped prisoner.</i>

35:46.811 --> 35:48.479
<i>All units. There is an officer down.</i>

35:48.563 --> 35:49.981
<i>-Request immediate backup.</i>
-(engine starts)

35:50.064 --> 35:52.275
<i>Escaped prisoner is Nicholas Kasner,</i>

35:52.358 --> 35:56.070
<i>described as white male,</i>
<i>34, wearing light brown windbreaker...</i>

35:56.154 --> 35:58.239
Unbelievable. The guy escapes.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.158
Turn right here. It's faster.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.577
(siren wailing)

36:08.374 --> 36:11.502
(tires screech)

36:13.546 --> 36:15.089
MAN: Everybody down!

36:15.173 --> 36:18.050
-(banging)
-Everyone down!

36:18.134 --> 36:19.760
They took Kolzicki to the hospital.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.806
The guy's got a gun on a woman in there.
We got a unit doing the alley in back.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.224
(helicopter blades whirring)

36:25.308 --> 36:28.686
MAN: You, in the house,
this is the police.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.646
Come out of there now!

36:33.941 --> 36:36.777
NICKY: You hear?
You stay put or she's dead!

36:39.155 --> 36:41.532
-(siren wailing)
-(police radio chatter)

36:42.241 --> 36:46.454
No, you'll have to maintain your position.
Our negotiating team has just arrived.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.254
He's ransacking the house
looking for pharmaceuticals.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.507
-We know who he's got?
-A Mrs. Sheila Redding.

36:58.591 --> 37:01.093
She's a widow, 53.
She works at the dry cleaners.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.929
-It's her house.
-What's he say?

37:04.931 --> 37:08.184
-NICKY: I want it now!
-He doesn't like the interior decor.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.686
We'll have a field phone
set up in a jiffy.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.941
Oh, even as we speak. Here.
Throw the switch and dial zero.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.986
-What are the demands?
-120 milligrams of Dilaudid.

37:20.112 --> 37:24.450
I explained to Mr. Kasner
that the police do not supply narcotics.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.036
-Nicky?
-She's got nothin' in here, man.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.080
The dumb broad's got nothin' in the house.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.040
Nicky, come on out of there.
We'll get you to a hospital.

37:31.123 --> 37:34.460
-They'll take care of business.
-Don't rag me, man, don't!

37:34.710 --> 37:37.296
You get it in here
or I take care of business in here!

37:39.257 --> 37:44.428
-How much do you need?
-I told you, 150 milligrams of Dilaudid.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.889
HENRY: <i>I heard 120.</i>

37:48.015 --> 37:50.935
(crying) Then, 120 then.
Now, get it in here!

37:51.018 --> 37:52.186
How's Mrs. Redding?

37:53.562 --> 37:56.524
She's cool for now.
She's better than that cop.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.234
He's alive.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.903
He's gonna be all right, Nicky.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.282
If we keep on this,
everything's gonna be okay.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.909
Listen, now, I need something from you.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.496
I want you to give me a little
of that cool you showed me before.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.498
<i>We both need that now.</i>
<i>You understand me, Nicky?</i>

38:12.581 --> 38:16.294
This broad... she keeps looking at me.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.129
I don't know--

38:19.171 --> 38:22.174
You see? You see there? You see?

38:22.258 --> 38:24.552
Then don't look at her, Nicky.
Don't pay any attention.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.805
She keeps looking at me!
Now, where's my stuff?

38:28.347 --> 38:29.265
Okay...

38:30.766 --> 38:31.934
I'm gonna try and get it.

38:32.601 --> 38:33.686
Take it easy.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.357
-You deployed?
-Ready when you are, H.G.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.945
-Not yet. Not yet.
-(Nicky yelling)

38:43.029 --> 38:44.071
What's it like?

38:44.155 --> 38:46.949
I can bring 'em both out, Frank.
Kasner and the woman.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.744
-I'm with you.
-But I gotta get him high.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.122
Frank?

38:53.748 --> 38:54.874
I'm listening.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.876
HENRY:
<i>He wants 120 milligrams of Dilaudid.</i>

38:56.959 --> 38:58.669
I contacted his girlfriend.
I'm having her brought here.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.504
But she said it's his right dosage.

39:01.088 --> 39:02.923
Frank, it's all he wants.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.551
<i>-I think we can get him out clean.</i>
-Sort of.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.220
Sort of. Right.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.348
Uh, I'll try to get you clearance, Henry.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.932
<i>Frank, don't hang me up with him.</i>

39:12.350 --> 39:13.601
I'll call you back in two minutes.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.189
Straight shooting, Frank. How did I do?

39:18.272 --> 39:19.398
Straight shooting?

39:19.482 --> 39:21.692
He bloodied my nose
once or twice, no question.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.029
But on the issues,
the man is a functional illiterate.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.114
People are gonna see that,
don't you agree?

39:27.198 --> 39:30.034
-I think he licked you.
-It's that damn Robson thing.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.203
He hung me out to dry.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.872
I never should have mentioned that letter.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.248
Einstein's idea.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.250
Chief, we have a situation
over on Jefferson.

39:38.334 --> 39:39.877
I'd like to get your authorization.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.171
Frank, I want your best recollection.

39:42.254 --> 39:46.634
Was I involved in a single policy decision
on the Robson matter?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.221
-Not to my knowledge.
-You're damn right! Good for you!

39:50.596 --> 39:52.723
We're gonna hit that hard
in the morning papers, Frank.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.517
I did not make decision one.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.144
-Chief--
-It was Mahoney.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.481
Guy's off the deep end.
Thinks he knows my secret soul.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.025
Well-intentioned as Dennis may have been,

40:03.234 --> 40:05.820
he has made a botch of this
department's decision-making.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.196
That has got to come out.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.864
Meaning you're back to making decisions?

40:08.948 --> 40:11.909
Candidate or not,
I think I have to take up the reins.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.787
We have an addict
holding a hostage over on Jefferson.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.247
He's demanding narcotics.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.040
Narcotics?

40:18.124 --> 40:20.209
Henry believes they could
buy us some lives.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.712
-Henry does.
-I believe we ought to authorize.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.507
Well, I have to trust
your judgment, Frank.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.550
Go ahead, then.

40:27.633 --> 40:30.010
Uh, Chief, we have some talking to do.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.847
Gotta go. We're clear on Robson.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.561
Lieutenant Goldblume.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.815
What did you think, Ray?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.234
It was an interesting debate, Chief.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.445
I missed you, Ray.
I'm sorry you weren't there.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.737
I am, too.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.947
That Robson business,

40:50.030 --> 40:52.116
I thought Ozzie was a little out of line.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.744
Coming down to the wire, Ray.
Time to stand up and be counted.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.664
I'm sorry, Chief.
I decided to vote for Ozzie.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.374
That could be a mistake you'll regret.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.377
If it is... I will live with it.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.299
-(police radio chatter)
-(helicopter whirring)

41:10.176 --> 41:13.637
Henry, Davis just called in,
they've got it.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.515
-They're on their way.
-NICKY: I'm not waiting any longer!

41:16.599 --> 41:19.977
She's a goner, man, and you did it!
You did it!

41:21.645 --> 41:24.648
(on megaphone)
Nicky, it's on the way. It's coming.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.027
Two minutes! Two minutes!
I give two minutes!

41:28.110 --> 41:29.653
Come on, come on!

41:29.737 --> 41:32.114
(sirens wailing)

41:41.373 --> 41:42.833
-That it?
-Yeah.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.794
-She's on the nod a little.
-Desiree?

41:45.878 --> 41:47.630
I want to talk to Nicky.

41:47.713 --> 41:49.924
He loves me. Let me talk to Nicky.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.426
-Nicky!
-Shut up! Shut her up.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.345
-We got it!
-Judas.

41:59.058 --> 41:59.975
All right.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.685
(telephone rings)

42:02.269 --> 42:03.354
Nicky?

42:05.356 --> 42:06.232
Nicky, I've got it.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.693
-You got it?
-HENRY: <i>I got the stuff.</i>

42:09.777 --> 42:11.987
<i>-NICKY: Throw it through the window.</i>
-Uh-uh, Nicky.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.739
<i>You send Mrs. Redding out,</i>
<i>then you get it.</i>

42:13.822 --> 42:16.742
No! I said throw it through the window
or I'll kill her!

42:21.455 --> 42:25.876
No, sir. No, sir. Nobody's gonna die.

42:26.585 --> 42:27.711
You listen to me, Nicky.

42:28.128 --> 42:28.963
If that woman is harmed,

42:29.046 --> 42:31.340
I'll make sure you
never get high again in your life.

42:31.423 --> 42:32.424
I swear it.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.802
She worth that, Nicky? No more dope?

42:34.885 --> 42:36.303
-Easy.
-No.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.347
NICKY: Throw it in, I'll let her go!

42:39.265 --> 42:40.224
No.

42:41.183 --> 42:43.644
Mrs. Redding comes out first,
then you get it.

42:43.727 --> 42:47.022
It ain't fair! (crying)

42:50.067 --> 42:52.027
Wanna get high, you gotta pay the price.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.780
I'll kill her! I'll kill her!

42:54.863 --> 42:56.031
No, you won't.

42:56.115 --> 42:59.201
(siren wails)

43:01.662 --> 43:05.082
NICKY: I want it now! I want it now!

43:07.793 --> 43:09.378
FRANK: Give me the rundown, Henry.

43:10.337 --> 43:13.632
Uh, I'm trying for an exchange.
We get Mrs. Redding, he gets the drugs.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.509
He'll go for it.

43:16.969 --> 43:20.306
MAN: <i>All officers are to stay</i>
<i>behind the cover of vehicles...</i>

43:21.557 --> 43:22.975
Throw it in!

43:23.309 --> 43:25.603
-We can take him.
-No, no.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.564
He's still armed, Howard.
Let's do it Henry's way.

43:29.523 --> 43:32.985
-NICKY: I want it now!
-(banging, glass shatters)

43:33.068 --> 43:34.320
Now!

43:44.705 --> 43:46.290
All right, Nicky. Here it is.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.551
MAN: <i>Last warning.</i>

43:57.635 --> 44:01.221
<i>Those who do not keep clear</i>
<i>of the cordoned areas...</i>

44:01.305 --> 44:03.807
Talk him out.
Tell him to throw out his gun.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.228
(ringing)

44:13.901 --> 44:16.487
DESIREE: <i>Nicky? Sweetheart?</i>

44:17.237 --> 44:19.323
Desiree, sweetheart, I got it.

44:19.406 --> 44:20.658
I know.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.369
It was me made them give it to you.

44:23.452 --> 44:24.536
<i>I did it for you.</i>

44:25.788 --> 44:26.872
It's coming.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.167
It's getting to me.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.921
I love you, Nicky.

44:36.256 --> 44:37.424
I love you.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.468
Tell him to throw his gun out.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.428
I don't want an OD out of this.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.891
Why don't you come out, Nicky?

44:45.974 --> 44:48.185
<i>I don't want anything</i>
<i>happening to you in there.</i>

44:48.769 --> 44:50.604
I love you so much, baby.

44:53.399 --> 44:54.566
Nicky?

44:56.485 --> 44:58.404
-Oh, my God!
-Nicky!

44:59.571 --> 45:01.198
Nicky!

45:09.039 --> 45:10.749
DESIREE: Nicky!

45:10.833 --> 45:14.753
(police radio chatter)

45:28.058 --> 45:29.101
NICKY: I'm all right.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.312
I feel all right.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.607
(police radio chatter)

45:45.909 --> 45:48.454
Hey, Gomez and Davis
took what's-her-name home.

45:48.954 --> 45:51.039
-Don't forget the field cards.
-(yawning) Yeah.

45:51.540 --> 45:55.210
JOE: All right, everybody.
Party's over. Tent's down.

45:58.589 --> 45:59.465
Hi.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.094
-(chuckles) What are you doing here?
-I got your message.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.556
I-- But I said I was gonna be late.
I didn't think you would show up.

46:07.639 --> 46:09.933
I mean-- It's okay. It's great!

46:11.018 --> 46:14.480
But we have to stick around.
We gotta finish up some stuff, okay?

46:14.563 --> 46:15.647
Hey, Doc.

46:16.273 --> 46:18.150
-Hi, Joe. How you doin'?
-Good. Good. How you doin'?

46:18.233 --> 46:19.276
Good.

46:22.070 --> 46:25.115
-How are the ribs?
-Mm, good.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.617
Hurts a little, you know, once in a while.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.452
-Anybody hungry?
-Yep!

46:28.535 --> 46:29.745
Yeah.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.206
Hey, why don't you come to Mulligan's
with us? We're going over there.

46:32.289 --> 46:35.751
Uh, we might have had something
more elegant planned, maybe?

46:35.834 --> 46:37.336
Mulligan's sounds good to me.

46:37.419 --> 46:40.380
Doc, what do you think
I oughta do about my poor flesh?

46:41.340 --> 46:44.092
-What's the problem?
-Well, I just got it all scraped raw

46:44.176 --> 46:46.595
trying to get off some dye that got on me.

46:46.887 --> 46:49.640
-Cocoa butter and vitamin E.
-Ah, how 'bout that?

46:49.723 --> 46:51.809
Professional advice. I like this guy!

46:51.892 --> 46:53.310
-I like this guy.
-Come on, let's go eat.

46:53.393 --> 46:54.478
That's great.

47:01.819 --> 47:02.903
Good work, Henry.

47:03.445 --> 47:04.530
Thought we could get 'em both out.

47:04.613 --> 47:05.614
You were right.

47:06.198 --> 47:08.033
Didn't want another Hector Ruiz.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.994
I know. You did the right thing.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.540
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.254
-(door shuts)
-(engine starts)

47:22.589 --> 47:24.049
I'm glad for Henry.

47:24.716 --> 47:26.176
Mm. He needed one.

47:34.852 --> 47:35.811
Finish.

47:39.064 --> 47:41.483
Oh, rash youth. (giggles)

47:41.567 --> 47:44.403
Never say "rash" to a married man.

47:44.945 --> 47:45.904
-Mm-hmm.
-(gasps)

47:45.988 --> 47:49.157
-(giggles)
-(both moan)

47:49.241 --> 47:51.326
-Mm. Mm. Ouch!
-What?

47:52.244 --> 47:53.203
Oh.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.707
The Robson case notes.

48:00.168 --> 48:03.422
Is anyone besides me going to
that little boy's funeral tomorrow?

48:03.505 --> 48:05.257
It's probably gonna be a full house.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.218
-Oh, damn.
-What?

48:09.928 --> 48:12.639
I was gonna go see
Mike Perez's wife today.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.402
