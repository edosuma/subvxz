00:29.329 --> 00:32.423
Happy, stop that.

00:32.499 --> 00:35.024
Hap.

00:35.101 --> 00:38.093
What's with her all of a sudden?

00:39.706 --> 00:43.870
- Don't you look at my letters.
- For God's sakes.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.866
Read 'em and weep, my dear.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.200
Seven letters.

01:13.306 --> 01:15.399
50 bonus points.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.149
Darren.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.393
- Get in the basement.
- What are you gonna do?

01:38.498 --> 01:40.989
Just do what l say.

02:10.562 --> 02:12.963
l got a gun.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.632
Stop.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.698
Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.310
They told me l'd find you inside.

05:14.414 --> 05:18.646
l was out back,
talking to the detective in charge.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.983
You're the expert. Everyone's waiting
to hear what you have to say on this.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.750
What do we know?

05:24.824 --> 05:29.318
Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.
Married 32 years, three kids, five grandkids.

05:29.429 --> 05:34.731
Not an enemy in the world.
That's their dog out front. Neck's broken.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.669
From the footprints in the mud,
best guess is we're looking for two perps.

05:38.771 --> 05:42.070
Nothing stolen from the house.
Nothing to suggest motive.

05:42.141 --> 05:47.443
lt all fits a profile.
This thing is staged to look like satanic ritual.

05:47.513 --> 05:52.416
Placing victims
in a murder-suicide posture is ritualistic.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.784
And this word is undoubtedly satanic.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.789
''Daemonicus?''

05:57.857 --> 06:00.155
lt means ''Satan'' in Latin.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.922
Or daemonicus - demon possession.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.430
And it's worth 50 extra points.

06:08.368 --> 06:14.466
That's why they were posed like this, so we'd
think that these folks were possessed, right?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.134
That would be the textbook explanation.

06:19.345 --> 06:23.509
- l'll let 'em know.
- This may be something else.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.513
Which is what?

06:31.657 --> 06:36.560
Say anything you want about satanic ritual,
but don't tell me you think the devil did this.

06:36.662 --> 06:41.463
Cos we got prints on the lawn out there.
This case ain't even close to being an X-File.

06:41.534 --> 06:46.062
Something strange happened in here
just before you came in. l can't explain it.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.672
What?

07:11.497 --> 07:16.264
Dr Dana Scully.

07:19.205 --> 07:24.768
l have just been assigned to the Academy
as a forensic investigator.

07:24.877 --> 07:29.541
For the past eight years l was
part of a unit known as the X-Files.

07:31.784 --> 07:37.017
- Some of you may have heard of it.
- Did you ever slay a vampire?

07:38.391 --> 07:43.260
Sorry to disappoint you,
but this is a course in forensic pathology.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.922
Hard science.

07:46.032 --> 07:51.026
An X-File is a case that has been
deemed unsolvable by the Bureau.

07:51.103 --> 07:56.405
Because such a case cannot be solved,
it may beg other explanations.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.206
A vampire, perhaps.

08:00.913 --> 08:07.113
Science, however, tells us that evil comes
not from monsters but from men.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.883
lt offers us the methodology
to catch these men.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.723
And only after
we have exhausted these methods

08:14.794 --> 08:22.428
should we leave science behind
to consider more extreme possibilities.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.026
What'd you find?

08:56.135 --> 09:01.596
l asked Agent Scully for her expertise on this.
Looks like we can rule out The Exorcist.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.507
And why is that?

09:04.610 --> 09:09.377
There's adhesive residue
on Mrs Mountjoy's wrists and face.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.973
Can you see that?

09:13.319 --> 09:18.848
She was taped and bound and then shot at a
range of 10-12ft with her husband's handgun.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.188
The husband shot her.

09:23.696 --> 09:25.391
He was tricked into it.

09:25.498 --> 09:28.467
That's what we were thinking.
Some kind of sick game.

09:28.534 --> 09:35.633
There's also evidence of
fingerprint bruising along his collarbone.

09:38.544 --> 09:40.842
They held him down.

09:40.913 --> 09:45.145
- Shot him in his chair.
- Again we're looking for two guys.

09:45.217 --> 09:48.015
The snakes appear to be purely symbolic.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.579
They're a nonvenomous species
collected locally.

09:51.691 --> 09:56.424
They were sewn postmortem
into the body cavity with household thread

09:56.529 --> 10:00.829
by someone who appears
to have surgical skill.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.663
You've made a lot of headway.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.702
But there's something else.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.402
There's something that you're not saying.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.673
When l was alone in that house this morning,

10:14.747 --> 10:18.513
l had the strong feeling
l was in the presence of evil.

10:20.886 --> 10:26.552
We were called in on this because
you've investigated hundreds of these cases.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.892
And not once did l find
any evidence of genuine satanic activity.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.726
l'm sayin'...

10:32.798 --> 10:35.198
l've never felt this before.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.570
Excuse me.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.600
John Doggett.

10:46.445 --> 10:50.472
Agent Scully, have you ever sensed
what l'm talking about?

10:50.583 --> 10:54.485
l've felt things that l couldn't understand.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.886
Things l was afraid to admit even to myself.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.254
And what did you do?

11:00.326 --> 11:03.454
l learned not to ignore it.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.426
To trust my instincts.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.236
Yeah. Thank you.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.895
What is it?

11:12.972 --> 11:17.807
A mental hospital, a hundred miles from here.
They think one of their patients did this.

12:02.388 --> 12:06.119
We're pretty shaken up.
We're trying to determine how he escaped.

12:06.192 --> 12:10.151
Why do you think this patient, Kenneth
Richman, was involved in these murders?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.323
Dr Richman was committed
cos he killed three patients.

12:13.399 --> 12:18.200
He sewed strychnine into their stomachs
in surgery. When l heard about the snakes...

12:18.304 --> 12:22.331
The police believe two men
committed this crime, Dr Sampson.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.673
- Two men?
- Any idea who the second man might be?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.744
No. He didn't exactly keep pen pals.

12:28.848 --> 12:34.309
Did Dr Richman display any knowledge of
satanic lore or speak of demonic possession?

12:34.386 --> 12:39.153
No. He was perfectly cogent. He didn't
suffer from those kinds of delusions.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.716
l'm not really asking about delusions.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.324
When you last spoke to him,
did he seem himself?

12:46.398 --> 12:48.525
''Seem himself?''

12:48.601 --> 12:51.263
Did he display a personality
other than his own?

12:51.370 --> 12:55.204
Speak in tongues
or in a language he didn't know?

12:55.274 --> 12:59.677
You're asking me if he was possessed?
This is the 21st century, Ms Reyes.

12:59.745 --> 13:04.045
We stopped looking a long time ago
for demons to explain mental illness.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.085
l'm not really talking about mental illness.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.584
Excuse me a moment.

13:18.764 --> 13:22.393
You know, Monica,
a room here just came open.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.907
You heard what she said. Dr Richman didn't
know anything about satanic ritual.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.703
That proves he was possessed?

13:30.776 --> 13:34.439
Explain how else he commits a crime
that's a perfect example of it.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.778
Let's try the obvious.
lt was his accomplice.

13:38.384 --> 13:43.822
Agents, l think the man you're looking for
might be Paul Gerlack.

13:43.923 --> 13:47.723
- ls he a patient here?
- No. He's a guard.

13:47.793 --> 13:50.956
He's been with us 12 years
and no one can find him.

13:51.063 --> 13:55.056
Who would be the last person
who saw them together?

15:05.537 --> 15:07.869
Mr Kobold?

15:07.973 --> 15:13.343
My name is John Doggett.
This is Monica Reyes. We're with the FBl.

15:19.251 --> 15:25.315
The patient in the cell next to yours escaped
last night. Did you see or hear anything?

15:26.358 --> 15:31.591
You shared the same guard. Do you know
anything about their relationship?

15:31.697 --> 15:34.825
Why he would have helped him to escape?

15:36.735 --> 15:41.434
You mean, did the guard
force the patient to escape?

15:41.540 --> 15:44.065
Or did the patient force the guard?

15:45.511 --> 15:48.503
Or are they both of one mind?

15:49.014 --> 15:53.417
Like a snake, eating its own tail.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.680
You know something about this?

15:58.724 --> 16:04.754
lf you do, we need your help
to stop them before they hurt more people.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.528
You're too late for that.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.232
lf you're afraid to help us, we can protect you.
No harm will come to you.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.106
Do you believe in the power of the devil?

16:24.450 --> 16:28.614
l believe that the devil's
a story made up to scare people.

16:30.589 --> 16:33.387
Then how can you possibly protect me?

16:38.897 --> 16:41.593
Consider the source.

17:39.525 --> 17:44.121
He's been calling for Agent Doggett
for an hour. He's extremely agitated.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.663
Has he said why?

17:45.731 --> 17:50.134
He keeps saying ''prince of the apostles.''
l don't know what it means.

17:50.202 --> 17:55.401
l had to restrain him. l thought it best
not to sedate him till you speak to him.

18:02.981 --> 18:06.917
- lt's John Doggett.
- He's speaking to me.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.419
Whispering in my ear.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.820
What's he saying to you?

18:13.892 --> 18:16.986
He's killed again.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.990
- Who?
- l don't know.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.662
But l can show you.

19:05.611 --> 19:11.811
You can't know what it feels like, being free
of that cage, to see the sky above me.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.647
Where is he?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.320
There. l can take you.

19:22.427 --> 19:27.387
That's far enough.
Take him back to his cage now. Agent Reyes?

19:31.837 --> 19:34.397
- Think he's makin' it up?
- Yeah.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.939
That was a convincing show back there.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.946
He's play-acting.
Just cos he's good at it doesn't make it true.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.982
Then why do it?

19:44.082 --> 19:49.645
He wants some fresh air. Maybe he gets off
sending the FBl on snipe hunts.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.155
l don't think that's it.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.440
lt's the security guard. Paul Gerlack.

20:17.950 --> 20:23.320
lt appears he was shot in the chest. His body
was staged postmortem, just like the others.

20:23.388 --> 20:27.154
- Someone likes to play games.
- Or not.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.686
''Prince of the apostles.''
Kobold kept repeating it in his cell.

20:31.797 --> 20:35.460
Saint Peter. He was said
to have been crucified upside down.

20:35.534 --> 20:39.300
A symbol adopted by Satanists
to mark the power of the Antichrist.

20:39.371 --> 20:44.832
You see that as proof the devil possessed the
surgeon and put him in touch with Kobold?

20:44.910 --> 20:47.674
lt's part of the literature.

20:47.746 --> 20:53.844
He could be a medium, a willing host
for Satan, communicating with Kobold.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.582
- That's convenient.
- He brought up the devil and the snakes.

20:57.689 --> 21:02.490
- No one told him the details, but he knew.
- That's cos he planned it.

21:02.561 --> 21:07.931
l pulled his file. He's a master manipulator.
He was a professor at the University of Miami,

21:08.033 --> 21:13.528
committed for grinding up six
coeds that he tricked into his basement.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.336
He used their flesh as fertilizer in his garden.

21:18.043 --> 21:23.572
lf Kobold's part of this, why is he still behind
bars? Why not escape when he had chance?

21:24.082 --> 21:26.516
l don't know yet.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.950
You believe this guy, Agent Scully?

21:31.056 --> 21:34.355
l haven't formed an opinion about it yet,
actually.

21:35.894 --> 21:38.795
That's great. Just great.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.590
Where are you going?

21:42.701 --> 21:47.195
This man Kobold can help us.
l'm gonna prove it to you.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.663
- Professor...
- You found the body.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.461
Yes.

22:16.568 --> 22:21.403
Professor Kobold, we need your help to find
him before anyone else gets hurt.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.169
- l can't.
- You can't or you won't?

22:24.276 --> 22:29.270
l can't... in here.

22:30.949 --> 22:36.319
He whispers to me in a thousand voices,
but they're so hard to hear.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.816
What can we do to help you hear?

22:46.932 --> 22:49.992
l need a larger room.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.593
One with space.

22:52.671 --> 22:56.437
And windows to see the sky.

23:05.484 --> 23:08.715
You're not going along with this?
Giving him what he wants?

23:08.820 --> 23:11.653
- That was my general idea.
- You're makin' a mistake.

23:11.723 --> 23:16.126
Even if you're right,
even if this man is faking it, he can help us.

23:16.194 --> 23:20.790
l'm not willing to turn my back on that.
Are you?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.761
This is Officer Custer.

23:54.332 --> 23:58.996
- He's gonna keep an eye on you.
- l'm familiar with Officer Custer.

23:59.070 --> 24:03.063
l'm right outside the door
if you need anything, Professor.

24:03.542 --> 24:07.069
Agent Reyes believes me.
But you don't, Mr Doggett.

24:07.179 --> 24:11.843
- lt doesn't matter what l believe.
- l'm wondering...

24:13.251 --> 24:18.917
why a skeptic such as yourself would accept
assignment to an obscure unit of the FBl

24:19.024 --> 24:24.291
devoted exclusively to the investigating
of paranormal phenomena.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.591
Been checkin' up on me?

24:26.698 --> 24:30.395
Men don't pursue occupations
against their own inclination

24:30.469 --> 24:34.462
unless there's some strong
countervailing reason.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.770
Seeking the love or approval
of a woman, perhaps.

24:37.876 --> 24:43.109
Agent Reyes may have affection for you,
but you for her?

24:43.882 --> 24:47.716
Of course, it could be someone else.
Or something else.

24:47.786 --> 24:52.314
- Some dark secret from your past.
- That's enough.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.757
An unsolved tragedy
for which you feel responsible.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.319
ln some morbid way
you haven't even admitted to yourself,

24:59.431 --> 25:06.234
perhaps you feel that chasing ghosts
will answer the questions which damn you.

25:07.572 --> 25:11.565
l don't have time for this.
Tell me if he says anything.

25:11.643 --> 25:13.736
Agent Doggett?

25:18.783 --> 25:20.512
Agent Reyes.

25:20.619 --> 25:22.678
Get Agent Reyes.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.952
- He's saying something.
- Medicus.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.690
Medicus.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.129
Physician.

26:28.486 --> 26:30.545
Dr Sampson!

26:42.500 --> 26:44.559
John.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.678
Dr Sampson?

27:43.828 --> 27:49.323
The syringes contained droperidol, the same
anti-psychotic drug she gave Dr Richman.

27:49.401 --> 27:54.839
- He's not the one calling the shots.
- You still think that it was Kobold?

27:55.573 --> 28:00.840
This is not about demons. lt's not about
demonic possession. lt's about men.

28:00.945 --> 28:04.278
Have you considered that
something else might be going on?

28:04.349 --> 28:09.309
l heard you say it.
l heard you tell a classroom full of FBl cadets.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.754
Most evil in the world comes from men.

28:12.824 --> 28:18.091
But l also said that when science fails
we have to consider extreme possibilities.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.943
l know what you're feeling.

28:33.011 --> 28:35.946
l know your frustration.

28:36.014 --> 28:39.814
But you can't let it cloud your objectivity.

28:39.884 --> 28:46.312
Agent Reyes is thinking just what this guy
Kobold wants her to think. Now you are too.

29:08.646 --> 29:11.740
Professor, are you done with this meal?

29:29.000 --> 29:33.664
l brought you something.
Something to read.

29:36.341 --> 29:40.334
lt's a monograph you wrote six years ago.

29:41.412 --> 29:43.505
You know the one l'm talking about?

29:43.581 --> 29:48.245
About the influence of Satan
in Renaissance thinking.

29:55.860 --> 29:58.420
So you've found your proof.

29:59.731 --> 30:02.632
Circumstantial though it may be.

30:04.102 --> 30:07.970
You planned this whole thing.
l wanna know why.

30:10.875 --> 30:15.244
- l've been thinking a lot about you.
- You're not answering my question.

30:15.313 --> 30:20.876
About why someone so ill-suited would draw
this duty. Clearly you have feelings for her.

30:20.952 --> 30:23.386
You ordered Dr Richman to kill these people.

30:23.454 --> 30:27.288
But you can't compete
with the long-lost Agent Mulder.

30:27.392 --> 30:31.624
- His easy good looks, his Oxford education...
- This is about you.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.924
Mulder has what you can't have.

30:33.998 --> 30:39.095
But you stumble forward, the flat-footed cop,
thinking he can put handcuffs on a demon.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.832
- Answer the question!
- You want her.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.636
But she feels sorry for you.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.640
They both do.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.665
Guard.

31:07.765 --> 31:10.256
Guard, we need a medic.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.696
Guard.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.136
We need a medic. Guard.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.635
She's coming.

31:46.971 --> 31:51.806
- As far as l can tell, physically he's fine.
- Course he is.

31:51.876 --> 31:54.743
What brought this on?

31:54.846 --> 31:58.247
The guy's an expert in satanic history.
l confronted him on it.

31:58.349 --> 32:00.977
- Which proves what?
- Come on.

32:01.052 --> 32:05.751
You wanted to know who could stage a
textbook example. He wrote the damn book.

32:05.857 --> 32:09.691
l can't explain those voices
we heard in his room. Or this.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.229
- lt's a trick.
- What if it's ectoplasm?

32:12.330 --> 32:14.195
Ectoplasm?

32:14.265 --> 32:18.929
- You've heard of it, Agent Scully?
- Agent Mulder used to call it psychic plasma.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.495
A residual by-product
of telepathic communication.

32:22.573 --> 32:26.270
lt would have inorganic properties
that couldn't be explained.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.436
What are we talking?
The Ghost Busters?

32:28.546 --> 32:32.539
lf l'm right, analysis of this
could prove whether he's telling the truth.

32:32.617 --> 32:37.520
You can throw that crap away, cos l can tell
you this guy's a liar. He's playing a game.

32:37.588 --> 32:40.921
Let's just see how well he plays that game.

32:41.025 --> 32:44.426
Why? So you can get suckered in even more?
Listen to you two.

32:44.529 --> 32:45.860
Agent Doggett...

32:45.930 --> 32:51.596
This guy threw this stuff up for our benefit.
He knew what you'd say and what l'd say.

32:51.703 --> 32:56.970
He knew you would be so blinded by this
you wouldn't see what's in front of your faces.

32:57.075 --> 33:01.375
Agent Reyes is just
trying to get to the truth, OK?

33:01.446 --> 33:04.381
What are you doing?

33:12.623 --> 33:16.081
Maybe this is a hoax.
Maybe you're right.

33:16.160 --> 33:21.291
But you want us to turn away from evidence?
lt's not like you. l don't understand why.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.391
l already told you why.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.273
Scully.

35:13.377 --> 35:17.575
- l tried to reach you at Quantico.
- l'm on my way back to DC. What is it?

35:17.682 --> 35:21.345
Kobold told the guard he knows
where he can find Dr Richman to end this.

35:21.419 --> 35:22.886
Where?

35:22.954 --> 35:29.860
That's just it. lt sounds like ajoke, another
game. lt's a place called Happy Landing.

35:30.761 --> 35:31.750
Scully?

35:32.396 --> 35:37.026
- On the State Road 710, near Annandale.
- What are you talkin' about?

35:37.101 --> 35:41.367
There's an old marina there. l pass it
on my way home. l'm almost there now.

35:41.439 --> 35:44.806
State Road 710 near Annandale.

35:44.909 --> 35:47.537
We're gonna meet you there.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.367
Where is she?

37:27.345 --> 37:30.837
l don't know. But l know who does.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.681
- Where is she, Professor?
- Game's over.

37:34.752 --> 37:38.848
Tell me where she is right now
or l swear l'll kill you where you sit.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.652
You've lost.

37:40.725 --> 37:42.818
Where is she?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.638
- Agent Scully?
- Agent Doggett.

38:34.745 --> 38:37.145
Over here.

38:38.582 --> 38:40.550
l don't understand.

38:40.618 --> 38:45.055
He held me at gunpoint until you arrived
and then he shot himself.

38:45.122 --> 38:48.250
lt doesn't make sense.

38:48.326 --> 38:51.124
Yes, it does.

38:51.228 --> 38:53.458
The game's over.

39:03.274 --> 39:06.243
Joseph Kobold! Stop there.

39:06.310 --> 39:09.768
l am armed and l will shoot.

39:32.503 --> 39:38.669
Uncertainty. No matter how thorough the
investigation, some doubts inevitably remain.

39:38.776 --> 39:43.042
Just as juries seek to convict
beyond a reasonable doubt,

39:43.147 --> 39:49.017
the forensic investigator seeks conclusions
supported by a preponderance of evidence.

39:49.120 --> 39:54.285
Rarely will you encounter a case
where all of the variables,

39:54.358 --> 39:57.384
all of the open questions are fully answered.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.998
l'll see you Monday.

40:17.181 --> 40:20.378
Have you filed your report on this case yet?

40:20.484 --> 40:24.011
- l was gonna do it on my way home.
- We'd rather you didn't.

40:24.822 --> 40:28.087
We haven't accounted for Kobold's actions.
Not all of them.

40:28.192 --> 40:33.858
Agent Reyes said Kobold found information
about us on the lnternet. About Mulder too.

40:33.931 --> 40:37.059
That explains how he knew
we'd respond to the killings,

40:37.168 --> 40:40.160
why he staged them to look like satanic ritual.

40:40.237 --> 40:45.504
- He wanted us on the case. We know that.
- He bent everyone to do whatever he wanted.

40:48.212 --> 40:53.275
But we know all this already. lt was a game.
Every move was played out perfectly.

40:53.384 --> 40:56.683
- Except the last one.
- Unless that was part of the game too.

40:56.754 --> 40:59.587
- To get shot in the back?
- No.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.215
Kobold's body still hasn't been found.

41:02.293 --> 41:07.390
Kobold's dead.
Agent Doggett shot him. We all saw that.

41:07.465 --> 41:12.459
Did we? Think back to
Agent Reyes's question.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.365
Why didn't Kobold escape with the others
when he had the chance?

41:17.441 --> 41:22.435
Why? Because he wanted to escape
without anybody knowing that he'd escaped.

41:22.546 --> 41:27.415
So that by the time it was discovered,
he'd be too far away for anyone to find him.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.747
Satan.

41:28.819 --> 41:33.756
Daemonicus:
the beginning and end of our case.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.952
A snake eating its own tail.

41:37.061 --> 41:40.224
We lost. Kobold told me so.

41:40.297 --> 41:46.327
He wanted us to see how brilliantly
he played the game, how thoroughly we lost.

41:54.078 --> 41:57.741
The first victims,
Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.

42:00.484 --> 42:03.681
Chosen from the phone book.
For what reason?

42:03.787 --> 42:06.688
No reason, other than their names.

42:08.659 --> 42:11.958
- And the third victim.
- The doctor.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.327
Monique Sampson.

42:16.934 --> 42:22.304
And the last. The man whose body
is at the bottom of that river.

42:26.810 --> 42:28.869
lt's not Kobold?

42:28.979 --> 42:31.379
The guard we assigned him.

42:31.482 --> 42:35.680
The guard he knew he'd have
once we transferred him.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.780
Custer.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.689
Checkmate.

43:02.680 --> 43:06.047
Something's still bothering you.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.015
You don't believe his explanation?

43:10.087 --> 43:13.648
lt all makes sense to me as far as it goes.

43:14.692 --> 43:19.823
But there's something else.
Something he's afraid to explain.

43:19.897 --> 43:24.197
You mean that you felt the presence of evil?

43:24.935 --> 43:26.835
No.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.041
l mean that he felt it too.
