WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.070
I still don't get
why we're here.

00:05.072 --> 00:06.472
We've been over this, Doc.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.174
Last week, you had to tell
me I had made a friend.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.244
Let me repeat that: I
didn't know I had a friend.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.213
Got me thinking, maybe
I'm a little closed,

00:14.215 --> 00:15.681
and that's not the
best way for us

00:15.683 --> 00:17.449
to start our new life together.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.418
If our marriage is gonna work,
I need to be able

00:19.420 --> 00:22.121
to express myself better.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.156
Understood, but I am
a world-class behaviorist.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.058
If you want premarital
counseling, I could...

00:26.060 --> 00:27.326
No.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.594
We need a third party.

00:28.596 --> 00:29.695
Okay. All right.
We see a therapist.

00:29.697 --> 00:33.499
But... does it have to be him?

00:33.501 --> 00:36.402
I'm just tickled
you thought of me.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.038
Dr. Cecil is the man
for the job.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.373
He helped you and Walt
harmonize last year.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.509
He picked up on the fact
we were secretly dating,

00:43.511 --> 00:45.577
put it out there so that
the team could deal.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.695
If it wasn't for him,

00:46.696 --> 00:47.812
we might not even
be getting married,

00:47.815 --> 00:51.216
so suck it up and let's do this.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.718
Man's a doctor
like Crunch is a captain.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.354
His alma matter
has "dot com" in the name.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.656
Tobias, what matters here
is not matriculation.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.527
What matters here is
ramification, i.e. the outcome.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.496
Yes. But all that<i> comes out</i>
of your mouth is B.S.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.399
That's your inner child talking,
and he's rude.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.735
Now you both
filled out

01:09.737 --> 01:11.804
my pre-session questionnaire.

01:11.806 --> 01:14.740
Though Tobias's seemed to be
mostly creative suggestions

01:14.742 --> 01:16.809
for where I could shove
my paperwork.

01:16.811 --> 01:19.111
Miss Quinn, on
the other hand,

01:19.113 --> 01:21.480
took my assignment seriously.

01:21.482 --> 01:25.484
Seems your challenging childhood

01:25.486 --> 01:27.319
may have left you
a little, uh...

01:27.321 --> 01:29.488
"emotionally stingy."

01:29.490 --> 01:31.090
She's not stingy
with her emotions.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.392
She is particular
as to when she shares them.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.294
Happy, are you, uh, untrusting?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.162
No. She's discerning.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.263
Quick to anger?

01:38.265 --> 01:39.431
She's fiery.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.799
She's my spicy Asian noodle.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.634
The, uh, problem here
is crystal clear.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.636
Wow, you're
seriously gonna try

01:44.638 --> 01:47.172
to identify Happy's pathology
from a two-page questionnaire?

01:47.174 --> 01:50.476
Tobias, it's not Miss Quinn's
pathology I'm identifying.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.844
It's yours.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.545
Mine?

01:53.547 --> 01:55.447
Sweet. Your fault.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.116
You refuse to see

01:57.118 --> 01:58.851
any of Miss Quinn's flaws.
You put her on a pedestal.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.853
He's right. You do.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.221
You think I'm really great.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.255
And that's bad?

02:03.257 --> 02:05.724
Happy can't open
up, bare her soul,

02:05.726 --> 02:09.328
if she feels she won't
be given an honest assessment

02:09.330 --> 02:11.763
of her true self.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.599
Why share her
intimate thoughts and feelings

02:13.601 --> 02:15.234
if all she gets back from you

02:15.236 --> 02:16.902
is surface-level pabulum?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.337
I am honest with her.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.905
I honestly think
she's wonderful.

02:19.907 --> 02:23.175
Let's test that hypothesis.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.345
What's that?

02:26.347 --> 02:27.679
I call it the Bicker Clicker.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.914
Patent pending.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.519
How does it work?

02:33.521 --> 02:34.887
Every time you say
or do something

02:34.889 --> 02:37.256
that should cause you two
to bicker,

02:37.258 --> 02:38.490
he hits the clicker.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.626
It keeps count. We
get back together,

02:40.628 --> 02:42.928
review the numbers,
see where we are.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.231
We're gonna be at zero, because
everything she does delights me.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.567
Let me ask you something,
how do you feel

02:48.569 --> 02:52.704
about Happy dragging you here
to see me?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.520
"Timothy Armstrong
Commemorative Greenhouse"?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.756
Thought I'd name my new
hydroponic greenhouse

03:10.758 --> 03:11.890
in honor of Tim.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.559
This being
his old office and all.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.763
I got one.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.868
Huh.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.269
(door opens)

03:24.271 --> 03:25.871
And I think
you're being overly critical.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.606
I'm not being critical.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.340
Just think that Dr. Rizzuto
should live on a pond

03:29.343 --> 03:32.344
and we should throw bread
at him, 'cause he's a quack.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.545
Oh, look!

03:33.547 --> 03:34.680
They're doing something
distracting.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.481
Let's us see what that is.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.483
I'm about to test my Sandwich
Plane-Tiling Hypothesis!

03:38.485 --> 03:40.786
I can't miss this.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.721
All my life, I have
been trying to solve

03:42.723 --> 03:44.556
"square bread versus
round tomato."

03:44.558 --> 03:46.992
How to get total bread coverage

03:46.994 --> 03:48.827
without overlapping
the tomato slices,

03:48.829 --> 03:51.563
which has been impossible
because circles on a square

03:51.565 --> 03:54.333
in the Euclidean plane
have a maximum packing density

03:54.335 --> 03:55.500
of .9069.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.869
So, the solution
was to think

03:57.871 --> 04:01.273
outside of the box by
growing my tomatoes

04:01.275 --> 04:02.774
inside a box.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.743
Think you have too much time
on your hands

04:04.745 --> 04:06.278
now that the election's over.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.280
Quiet.
This is important.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.349
Says the inventor of the world's
stupidest hot dog.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.484
Wow. Everything is stupid
to you today.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.587
Hot dogs,
going to Dr. Rizzuto...

04:17.758 --> 04:19.858
There's still
some small gaps here.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.427
WALTER: Yeah, the round edges
are a problem.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.462
Maybe you should try
to cover the bread

04:23.464 --> 04:24.496
with one big tomato slice.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.764
Yes.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.866
Beef up the nutrient
slurry in the hydroponics,

04:27.868 --> 04:30.736
and make version
2.0 a super-tomato.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.005
I need measurements.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.873
(door opens)

04:34.875 --> 04:36.008
(door closes)

04:36.010 --> 04:37.876
Let me just show you
on the computer?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.278
Fine. Go ahead.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.879
I just think it's unnecessary.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.014
What's going on?

04:42.016 --> 04:43.849
Oh, Ralph wants
to change his look,

04:43.851 --> 04:45.984
go to a salon,
get a real haircut.

04:45.986 --> 04:49.388
Real haircuts happen
in barber shops, not salons.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.323
Where does he get
his hair cut now?

04:51.325 --> 04:55.394
Oh, I do it. I just put the blue
bowl over his head and trim.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.531
I wash it afterwards.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.666
What's this?

05:00.668 --> 05:02.034
I created a program
which allows me

05:02.036 --> 05:03.602
to digitally try out
new hairstyles.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.673
Cool.
Let me see this!

05:07.675 --> 05:10.809
How about... this one?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.378
You look like every
hockey player in 1992.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.946
Absolutely not.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.348
Oh, try this.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.887
Flock of Seagulls.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.655
WALTER: It's an
odd style, yes,

05:23.657 --> 05:24.990
but it doesn't look
like a single bird,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.692
much less
a large number of them.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.627
I don't get it either.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.962
Don't worry, Ralph. You're
too young and he's too Walter.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.064
Give me this.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.900
Thank you. Let me see...

05:34.902 --> 05:37.336
Oops.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.637
Oh. Evil genius.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.674
What's the matter with you?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.344
Don't like turning Ralph
into digital Wooly Willy?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.512
No, it's just Ralph never cared
about his hair or what he wore

05:47.514 --> 05:49.548
or anything like that before.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.717
He starts conforming, he's not
gonna be his true self anymore.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.270
I guess I
just don't want

05:54.271 --> 05:56.822
my sweet little genius to be
corrupted by the outside world.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.025
Look, Mom, I have Walter's hair.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.830
And... Happy.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.633
And "The Toby."

06:08.635 --> 06:10.135
Wow. Nobody looks good
in that hat.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.839
(clicks)

06:13.841 --> 06:15.640
For insulting the hat?

06:15.642 --> 06:16.808
The hat and I are one.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.444
Look, I'm Cabe.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.712
CABE: Looking
good, kid.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.048
(phone ringing)

06:25.519 --> 06:27.853
Agent Gallo.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.590
Did you see how he checked
that caller ID?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.525
He was hoping it was Allie.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.626
Cabe and Allie broke
up on the same day

06:34.628 --> 06:36.094
as you and Tim; you're fine.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.130
I knew that relationship
was ending.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.598
Cabe and Allie just got started.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.665
He's taking it hard.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.167
I carpooled with him
this morning.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.668
All we listened to was
Patsy Cline's "Crazy"

06:43.670 --> 06:44.669
on repeat.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.655
Who's Patsy Cline?

06:46.656 --> 06:48.640
Oh, she was the lead singer
of Flock of Seagulls.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.843
CABE: All right, listen up!
We've got a case.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.178
The client's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

06:54.148 --> 06:55.680
This is good.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.682
Give Cabe something
to take his mind off of Allie.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.484
How do you know about that?

06:59.486 --> 07:01.119
There's more gossip in
this place than a high school.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.022
At least, I assume so.
I take college classes.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.091
Part-time. You're still in
the sixth grade and your carpool

07:06.093 --> 07:08.727
will be here any minute.
Go get ready.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.197
CABE:
<i> This is Dr. Isabella Silva</i>

07:12.199 --> 07:13.765
of the World Health
Organization.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.900
Give her your
full attention.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.035
What do you know about Marari?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.771
It's a virus spreading through
the Amazon rainforest region

07:19.773 --> 07:21.606
of South America
and thousands are infected.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.108
SILVA: Yes, and the
mathematical models

07:23.110 --> 07:25.043
show that the number
of dead could quintuple

07:25.045 --> 07:27.779
by the end of next week.
SYLVESTER: The
differential equations

07:27.781 --> 07:30.782
they're using are
sound-- this is bad.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.818
And some of those infected
will get onto airplanes

07:32.820 --> 07:34.519
and before you know it...
Pandemic.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.087
Marari is a<i> muy</i> bad way
to give up the ghost.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.889
It starts with fever
and it heads south quickly.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.691
If you're lucky,
delirium sets in

07:39.693 --> 07:41.860
so you don't notice so much
while your insides liquefy.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.161
What is the cure?
There isn't one.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.047
That's where we come in.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.932
Your government told us about
the DNA device you developed

07:46.934 --> 07:49.134
to match genetic samples
in the field.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.837
Yes. We used it to identify
a war criminal in Cuba.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.672
Can you use it to run a more
in-depth analysis?

07:53.674 --> 07:54.906
Elaborate.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.907
Marari started in primates;

07:55.909 --> 07:57.559
it's killed thousands of them.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.210
But we've identified a rare
endangered monkey species

07:59.213 --> 08:02.681
called the Humboldt Capuchin
whose show no ill effects

08:02.683 --> 08:04.950
from the virus;
we believe it is immune.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.952
You want us to identify and
isolate the gene responsible

08:06.954 --> 08:08.887
for that immunity so that
a cure can be created?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.789
WALTER: It's just
additional calculations.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.190
It's quite basic, really;
at least it is for me.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.692
I can code it into
our device's software.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.711
HAPPY:
It does no good

08:15.712 --> 08:17.729
if we can't get our hands
on one of those rare monkeys.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.164
Actually a trapper managed
to catch one

08:19.166 --> 08:20.699
deep in the jungle last night.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.001
They're trucking it
to a remote airfield

08:23.003 --> 08:25.637
in the small
Amazonian rainforest country

08:25.639 --> 08:28.106
of Rhondon as we speak.
We need to hustle down there,

08:28.108 --> 08:30.609
and test this monkey
for the Marari virus

08:30.611 --> 08:31.610
before it spreads any more.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.812
If you can confirm this monkey

08:33.813 --> 08:36.013
is the linchpin, the W.H.O.
scientists can create a vaccine.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.716
Okay. We'll grab our gear.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.151
Uh, quick sidebar.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.891
There is a reason explorers call
the Amazon "The Green Hell."

08:45.893 --> 08:47.893
It is an unforgiving place

08:47.895 --> 08:50.095
filled with the most
deadly creatures on earth.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.596
Everything there wants to bite,

08:51.598 --> 08:54.165
sting, slash, crush, poison,

08:54.167 --> 08:56.535
infect or otherwise murder you.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.669
(Sylvester inhales)

08:57.671 --> 08:59.070
But I can handle that.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.940
I mean, you guys made me catch
a snake a few weeks back

09:01.942 --> 09:03.208
in the desert and I did that.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.710
You saved my life.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.712
So what's the problem?
Monkey.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.281
I have a legitimate phobia

09:09.283 --> 09:12.784
of the primate we call
<i> Macaca fascicularis.</i>

09:12.786 --> 09:14.853
Your phobia is a load of<i> Macaca.</i>

09:14.855 --> 09:16.121
I am terrified of monkeys.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.323
I nearly blew everything
in Djbouti last year

09:18.325 --> 09:21.626
because of one of those
furry vine swingers.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.161
I can't go.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.096
I'm gonna freak out and put
the entire mission at risk.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.065
HAPPY:
Well, you are in luck,
ya big baby,

09:27.067 --> 09:28.667
because we actually
need you here.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.969
Explain.
HAPPY: I'm not sure
if I can soup up

09:30.970 --> 09:33.270
the DNA scanner hardware
to do that much heavy lifting.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.807
The garage's computer power
would work better.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.310
So we get a sample
from the monkey,

09:38.312 --> 09:39.878
upload the data,
Sly runs the test

09:39.880 --> 09:41.780
to see if there are any
anti-viral proteins

09:41.782 --> 09:43.782
that could be making
the monkey immune.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.050
What might take hours
in the jungle

09:45.052 --> 09:47.486
could be done here in seconds.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.921
Thank you, Happy, for saving me
from unwanted monkey business.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.124
Chicken.
Scared of those, too.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.960
Okay, Sly stays. Rest
of us, time's wasting,

09:54.962 --> 09:57.028
lives are on the
line-- let's go.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.633
E.T.A. on the truck carrying
the monkey is any minute.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.635
Let's get set up
to run the test.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.769
I noticed a lot of bare patches
in the jungle

10:04.771 --> 10:05.837
when we were flying in.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.938
I thought the Amazon was lush.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.139
Illegal logging.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.674
A total area
the size of Germany

10:09.676 --> 10:11.109
has been decimated
over the last 40 years.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.028
WALTER:
The world's losing

10:13.029 --> 10:14.946
over 100 animal, plant
and insect species per day.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.147
TOBY:
And with them

10:16.149 --> 10:17.849
goes potential disease cures.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.851
A quarter
of western pharmaceuticals

10:19.853 --> 10:22.037
have sources in the rainforest,

10:22.038 --> 10:24.222
and only one percent of the
plants here have been tested.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.724
That means minute, every day,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.325
we could be losing the cure
for cancer... who knows?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.760
WALTER:
Not to mention,

10:28.762 --> 10:30.695
over 20% of the world's oxygen

10:30.697 --> 10:32.197
comes from the rainforest.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.398
And the more of this we lose,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.200
the less O2
and the more CO2 we get.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.102
Who's cutting down
all the trees?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.671
Here in Rhondon, it's mostly
a multinational logging company.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.972
CABE:
Rainforest hardwood

SILVA:
Locals have been

10:43.960 --> 10:45.744
fighting back, moving into
and occupying the work camps

10:45.746 --> 10:47.312
while the loggers are
out cutting trees.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.880
The corporation has

10:48.882 --> 10:50.815
started hiring
armed mercenaries.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.817
I was reading up on the
Amazon on the flight in.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.988
The local sloths have lost 90%
of their habitat due to logging.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.857
Poor little guys.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.792
You know they
mate for life?

11:00.794 --> 11:03.728
Which means there's gonna
be a lot of 'em left alone,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.263
hanging upside down,

11:05.265 --> 11:07.866
all by themselves,
waiting to die...

11:12.172 --> 11:14.239
(horn honks twice)

11:16.410 --> 11:18.677
They ambushed us!

11:18.679 --> 11:20.011
Who, Thiago?
Loggers' hired thugs.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.946
They shot our trapper!
HAPPY:
Oh, man.

11:24.184 --> 11:24.766
That the guy
who caught the monkey?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.349
He also caught a round
to the torso!

11:25.352 --> 11:27.085
Gunshot wound.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.819
Mid-clavicular line,
left fifth intercostal space.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.222
What does that mean?
Means if we don't get him
to a hospital, he's dead.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.758
SILVA:
I'll take him
on the helicopter,

11:33.760 --> 11:35.727
send it back for you ASAP.
(groaning)

11:35.729 --> 11:37.429
Where'd the monkey go?
I was off road,

11:37.431 --> 11:39.764
trying to get away,
and the cage got smashed open.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.233
He escaped?
We have to find it.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.035
How are we supposed
to do that?
She's right.
It's one monkey

11:44.037 --> 11:46.304
in a vast and hostile jungle,
and the only person with a clue

11:46.306 --> 11:48.373
how to trap and track
it has been shot.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.775
Well, you're the genius.
Just figure something out before

11:50.777 --> 11:52.744
that thing gets too far away,
because if you don't,

11:52.746 --> 11:53.878
the Marari virus
is gonna spread,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.080
and people are gonna die.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.782
Uh, not good.

The trapper

12:43.296 --> 12:44.529
recorded the monkey's vitals,

12:44.531 --> 12:46.198
so we're looking for something

12:46.199 --> 12:47.866
18 inches in length,
a mass of two pounds,

Half a mile from here.

Loggers' camp, but they shoot
first, ask questions later.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.092
Happy, Doc

13:15.228 --> 13:16.294
I'm coming with you.

25.

20, but I know the jungle.
Please.

My people are dying.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.837
I can't stand by

Sly,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.886
the heat signature
we're tracking isn't moving.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.955
Is the signal frozen?
I told you already.
I've checked it

13:43.957 --> 13:45.523
repeatedly.
He hasn't moved.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.492
Maybe he's a tired monkey.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.360
(Sylvester screams)

13:49.362 --> 13:52.430
(whimpering, yelling)

13:54.267 --> 13:56.234

13:56.236 --> 13:57.068
Why did you just scream?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.336
Caterpillar!

13:58.338 --> 14:00.605
If you're checking
on your tomatoes

14:00.607 --> 14:02.540
instead of monitoring
this monkey...

14:02.541 --> 14:04.474
I'm looking at the image now.
Ooh, what a shock.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.078
He hasn't moved. I'm giving you
accurate information.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.213
Why don't you check
for yourself?

14:08.214 --> 14:09.347
You're practically on top
of the thing.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.982
What's wrong with your hand?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.184
A caterpillar bit me,
and now, it's rashing up.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.586
It's in a cup in
my greenhouse.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.271
Do you think you could get it

14:16.272 --> 14:17.955
so we could check
the bioproteins in its saliva?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.157
I think
I'm terribly allergic.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.360

Well, there's no sign

14:24.064 --> 14:26.130

14:27.467 --> 14:30.001
Oh. There's the thermal
imaging source.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.336
Where?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.638
Up that tree, under the wasps'
nest, but... Oh.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.373
It's not a monkey.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.375

THIAGO:
It's camera trap.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.943
An environmental
group donated many

14:38.945 --> 14:40.945
to my village to disperse
through the jungle

14:40.947 --> 14:42.113
to watch for illegal loggers.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.381
The heat we picked up is

14:43.383 --> 14:45.016
from its battery,
so we just wasted

14:45.018 --> 14:47.218
our time.
Maybe, but we didn't.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.487
Got our eyes on a monkey.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.922
He's in a loggers' camp.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.361
Went into a tent.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.963
We've got it cornered
if we can get to it.

14:58.965 --> 15:02.333
I don't see any loggers.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.269
Probably out logging.
They do that.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.237
Shh. Look.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.439
HAPPY (whispering):
They left a guard.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.608
You think you can nail him
in the leg or something?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.978
Fire fight is just
gonna scare the monkey,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.281
or attract more bad guys.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.050
(wasps buzzing)

15:19.052 --> 15:21.052
I know how to get past him.
What are you thinking?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.954
A wasp bomb.
Sorry I asked.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.456
The tree moss is damp enough
to create plenty of smoke.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.542
Smoke makes wasps docile, so,

15:27.543 --> 15:29.627
then we cut down the nest,
carry it to the loggers' camp.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.996
Carry it? With what?
Uh... those.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.965
Those branches on the ground.
Pick 'em up.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.633
And then, we'll also need
some small vines.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.436
Be careful, Walter.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.604
Bugs are dangerous.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.472
(twig snaps)

15:41.474 --> 15:44.976
Ralph, have you looked up
the larva online yet?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.680
What are you doing?

15:48.682 --> 15:50.581
The caterpillar!
It's loose.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.017
No. I need to know
what species bit me!

15:53.019 --> 15:55.586
I'm red, irritated.
I could've ingested a toxin!

15:55.588 --> 15:58.723
Why don't you ingest an ice tea
and calm down?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.725
Just find it!

Oh, geez.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.332
Monkey still in the tent?

16:07.334 --> 16:10.134
Yup.
You okay?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.704
Nervous. I've seen
what those wasps can do.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.339
Please don't drop that nest.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.208
Okay, when
he comes around again,

16:17.210 --> 16:19.210
I will fling the wasp nest...

16:19.212 --> 16:21.279
<i>You're</i> gonna
fling it? Hey.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.215
How about the one with the, uh,
high school letter in lacrosse?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.351
You?
(sarcastically):
No. Toby.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.286

in the word "lacrosse."

16:29.489 --> 16:30.688
Quiet.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.759
Toss it just behind him.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.295
He'll think
the nest fell from the tree.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.401

17:23.243 --> 17:24.259
He's over there!

17:24.260 --> 17:25.276
(screeching)
WALTER: Whoa, whoa, whoa,

17:25.278 --> 17:26.511
that way, grab him!

17:29.282 --> 17:31.349
TOBY:
Careful.
Ah, ah...

17:31.351 --> 17:33.584
I got you, little...

17:33.586 --> 17:35.620
Come on, let's go.

17:35.622 --> 17:36.621
Easy...
Whoa!
(groans)

17:36.623 --> 17:38.289
Toby!

17:38.291 --> 17:40.425
Aah. I slipped in something.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.227
Aah, it came
from the monkey's butt!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.462
(shrieks)
Oh, God.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.831
Get it off of me!
(shrieking)

17:46.833 --> 17:49.167
Got it!
(whimpering)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.301
Get it, get it...

17:50.303 --> 17:52.403
(shrieks)

17:54.340 --> 17:56.541
(Toby groans)

17:56.543 --> 17:58.276
(screeching)
Aah, it's getting away!

17:58.278 --> 18:00.611
(monkey continues screeching)

18:02.248 --> 18:04.449
That way!

18:08.221 --> 18:10.455
In retrospect,

18:10.457 --> 18:12.824
the rucksack might have been
a bad idea.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.765
(sighs)

18:20.767 --> 18:21.833
(screeching)

18:28.475 --> 18:31.142
(chittering)

18:32.445 --> 18:34.345
WALTER:
Watch out! Watch out!
You okay? Okay?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.480
Oh, there! Over there!

18:35.482 --> 18:38.249
(chattering)

18:40.553 --> 18:41.819
How are we gonna
get him down?

18:41.821 --> 18:43.688
If we can't catch him
in an enclosed tent,

18:43.690 --> 18:45.756
how do we climb
up there and nab him?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.159
Uh, we need all hands on deck.
Toby, Happy, you coming?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.327
HAPPY:
On our way!

18:49.329 --> 18:51.295
I probably have
a concussion.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.297
Stop being a baby.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.466
(clicks)

18:55.468 --> 18:58.202
What the hell?
(clicks)

18:58.204 --> 18:59.637
I'm gonna take that clicker
and shove it up your...

18:59.639 --> 19:01.139
(clicking)

19:01.141 --> 19:03.141
There's a lot more
where those came from.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.245
We showed her.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.579
According to my research,

19:08.581 --> 19:10.748
the Humboldt Capuchin
has a mating ritual

19:10.750 --> 19:14.552
where they rub themselves with
the flower of the muira puama.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.487
Perhaps
you can entice him to bond.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.506
Where do we
find muira puama?

19:18.507 --> 19:20.524
They're everywhere out here.
We just passed some a ways back.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.792
Few meters high,
covered in small white flowers.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.478
Toby, Happy,

19:23.479 --> 19:25.163
did you hear that?
Way ahead of you, boss.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.464
PAIGE:
Thiago, what's wrong?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.568
Are you okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.170
It's just hot.
TOBY:
Okay!

19:32.172 --> 19:33.304
I got the flowers!

19:33.306 --> 19:34.639
What's wrong?

19:34.641 --> 19:37.241
The kid's got the virus.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.177
Oh, yikes.
He doesn't look good.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.778
Yikes? That's your
medical opinion?

19:40.780 --> 19:42.947
No. My medical opinion is
that Thiago's done for

19:42.949 --> 19:45.683
if we can't synthesize a cure
for him from that monkey.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.719
How did you miss that he was
sick? He's been sweating!

19:48.721 --> 19:50.388
We've been hiking
through the Amazon, Cabe.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.722
We're all sweating.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.925
Have we been exposed?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.561
Uh, virus is only contagious
before symptoms present.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.795
We could have missed
the window, or

19:57.797 --> 19:59.797
we could infected now.
It's too soon to tell.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.600
(monkey screeches, chatters)

20:02.602 --> 20:04.702
Let's get the little bastard
out of the tree already.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.837
Okay. Uh, well, someone
just has to rub these flowers

20:06.839 --> 20:10.908
all over themselves and attract
the little scamp down here.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.981
I already tangled
with Furious George in the tent.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.449
You touched the flowers.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.967
If more than one of us smell

20:19.968 --> 20:21.484
like muira puama,
it'll get confused.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.922
Besides, he could easily
be attracted to you.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.330
I'm not sure
if that was an insult.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.598
I found
an anthropological paper online

20:33.600 --> 20:35.733
describing their mating rituals.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.368
I'm sending it to you now.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.504
Got it. Okay, uh, Toby,

20:40.506 --> 20:43.674
squat down and...
hop in a circle.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.810
Mm-hmm.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.286
Stick your butt out more.
You got to present yourself.

20:59.726 --> 21:03.427
Oh... I am going to die.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.430
My milkshake brings
all the monkeys to the yard.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.733
(chittering)

21:08.735 --> 21:10.001
You got its attention.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.470
PAIGE:
Good, now...

21:12.472 --> 21:13.704
raise your eyebrows.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.375
More. Big eyes.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.979
Look, it's working.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.850
(screeches)

21:25.852 --> 21:28.052
Oh, he's sweet.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.689
I'm gonna call you Simian Freud.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.294
I-I didn't say anything.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.728
I know what you're thinking.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.064
So what do we do, draw blood?
No, no.
You know what,

21:40.066 --> 21:42.400
a cheek swab'll work just
as well and it won't hurt him.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.735
Hey, Simian,
we're gonna do

21:44.737 --> 21:47.305
a little monkey see, monkey do.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.639
Now, I'm gonna open my maw

21:48.641 --> 21:50.908
real wide and you do
the same. You ready?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.718
Sly, coming your way.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.489
Got it.
Running the tests now.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.026
We have a problem.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.596
Wow, this virus
is moving through Thiago

22:12.598 --> 22:13.864
like jerky through Cabe.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.533
SYLVESTER:
Unfortunately, the data

22:15.535 --> 22:17.702
I just ran
won't do him any good.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.570
Why not?
Because

22:19.572 --> 22:21.605
the DNA analysis is complete.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.674
And the monkey is not the cure.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.983
What do you mean
the monkey isn't the cure?

22:31.984 --> 22:33.851
Are you sure, Sly?
Uploading the results
to you now.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.856
Well, he's right. There's
nothing here that denotes

22:38.858 --> 22:42.093
any type of atypical
viral protection.
But the monkeys

22:42.095 --> 22:44.628
are immune to the virus.
How's that possible if Toby

22:44.630 --> 22:46.831
can't find anything in its DNA?
Uh, could be a parasite.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.100
Then let's cut it open
and see what's in there.

22:49.102 --> 22:51.035
You keep your hands
off my monkey.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.370
WALTER:
Agreed.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.571
Dissecting the monkey would be

22:53.573 --> 22:55.106
an inefficient use of resources.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.640
We only have one.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.609
Holy poop.
I have a solution.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.844
Monkey turds.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.479
I need to know
his diet.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.114
We check its stool.
If you're gonna
make that monkey

23:03.116 --> 23:04.982
poo the same way
you made it open its mouth

23:04.984 --> 23:06.117
I'm out of here.
No, no, no,

23:06.119 --> 23:07.585
I got a better way.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.753
We dig through this.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.155
I stepped in its
caca in the tent.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.425
What's Toby talking about?

23:14.427 --> 23:15.693
A pile of crap.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.861
Isn't he always?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.796
Have you found
the caterpillar yet?
No.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.431
But he can't hide forever.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.535
Sly, the world's grossest
scavenger hunt turned up

23:24.537 --> 23:27.138
zero critters, but I did
find some odd-looking seeds,

23:27.140 --> 23:28.539
and I'm sending you a photo...

23:28.541 --> 23:29.940
now.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.041
Here's your pen.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.544
You can keep it.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.179
SYLVESTER:
I think I got something.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.882
Those seeds belong to the fruit
of the von von tree.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.884
The von von tree
grows to heights

23:39.886 --> 23:41.619
above the Amazon canopy,

23:41.621 --> 23:43.988
into the emergent
rainforest layer.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.589
It's endangered
by the logging industry.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.924
Not a lot of them left, guys.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.859
Von von tree. Got it.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.895
These monkeys eat
the von von fruit.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.797
They're the only thing
that does.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.032
Taste is terrible.
TOBY:
The fruit could contain

23:55.034 --> 23:56.600
biological properties
that protect the monkey.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.003
There's only one way
to find out.

23:59.005 --> 24:02.173
We mash the seed,

24:02.175 --> 24:05.643
a little alcohol
to break down the cell walls,

24:05.645 --> 24:07.978
voilà-- the sequencer
should read it.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.550
Got it, running the test.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.651
Thiago's burning up.
I don't think

24:13.653 --> 24:14.718
he's gonna
last much longer.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.886
We might have something.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.489
Sending.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.925
There's a zinc finger in the
seed's protein that resembles

24:20.927 --> 24:22.993
antiviral chemical structures.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.195
This could be it.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.497
Thiago...

24:26.499 --> 24:28.899
Hey, Thiago.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.201
Where can we find
a von von tree?

24:30.203 --> 24:33.938
<i> O macaco nao é um macaco.</i>

24:33.940 --> 24:35.940
His fever's progressed
to delirium. He can't help us.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.642
We have to hurry.
Now, if we've contracted

24:38.644 --> 24:40.044
the virus,
we can't risk going down

24:40.046 --> 24:42.646
before we find the fruit.
If we die, countless die.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.248
HAPPY:
Uh, how do we locate

24:44.249 --> 24:45.849
one rare tree
in the middle of the rainforest?

24:45.852 --> 24:48.486
We find out from
the tree experts: the loggers.

24:48.488 --> 24:49.587
Big risk to just go up to them.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.189
They shoot first,
remember?

24:51.190 --> 24:52.790
Especially after they found
their tent destroyed by Toby.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.692
There was a monkey
in a bag over my head.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.926
HAPPY:
They're from big corporations--

24:55.928 --> 24:57.261
there's got to be
a digital database.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.196
CABE:
So Sly can hack in there,

24:59.198 --> 25:01.699
go check their maps,
gets the tree GPS coordinates.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.034
That's a no-go.
I'm trying as we speak,

25:04.036 --> 25:06.153
and the loggers aren't uplinked.

25:06.154 --> 25:08.271
When we were using our tech to
track the computer at their camp

25:08.274 --> 25:09.607
I noticed
a very weak WIN signal.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.741
What's a WIN?

25:10.743 --> 25:11.775
Wireless intranet.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.143
Private network.
Probably connects

25:13.145 --> 25:14.178
their logging machinery.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.579
You can hack that?

25:15.581 --> 25:16.947
If I have
a strong enough signal.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.282
They're working
deep in the jungle,

25:18.284 --> 25:19.783
need a high spot
above the trees.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.619
PAIGE:
You mean like there?

25:23.089 --> 25:24.855
CABE:
Amazon book I was reading

25:24.857 --> 25:28.058
on the plane was talking about
zoologist expeditions

25:28.060 --> 25:29.827
that used these platforms

25:29.829 --> 25:31.762
to study wildlife in the canopy.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.063
It's a perfect place
to set up an antenna.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.298
First we have
to build one.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.799
Ralph and I used to get
TV with homemade

25:35.801 --> 25:38.168
coat hanger rabbit ears.
Metal blade of the machete

25:38.170 --> 25:40.304
and a coil of wire from my bag
will get their signal.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.172
If we can get it up there.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.641
If...<i> you</i> can get it up there.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.142
And how am I
supposed to do that?

25:45.144 --> 25:47.011
Now, we'll chop down
some vines and then

25:47.013 --> 25:48.612
tie them into a rope.
And I can make

25:48.614 --> 25:50.781
a grappling hook
from your backpack frame.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.716
Nobody can throw
a grappling hook up that high.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.085
Especially weighed down
by heavy vines.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.054
We're not gonna throw it,
we're gonna launch it.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.022
Now, Sly, can you see if you
can find us another camera trap?

25:59.025 --> 26:01.142
On it.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.260
Paige, Toby-- stay with Thiago.
Happy, Cabe, we'll also need

26:03.262 --> 26:04.795
a small hollow log.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.597
For what?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.299
I'll explain later.
Let's go.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.967
Found a camera trap
near you, Walter.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.235
Sending you the coordinates.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.709
Hurry up and find that worm.

26:20.313 --> 26:23.581
It's tiny.
This place is huge.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.783
Look faster.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.953
He's burning up.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.287
We got to get soursop.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.323
What's that?
Mother Nature's fever medicine.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.125
Um, grab a lighter from my bag
and get a fire going.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.163
I got the camera trap
and the hollow log.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.798
WALTER:
That'll do.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.266
You just found us our
mortar tube, Cabe.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.335
(panting):
All right.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.303
How we gonna fire this
without gunpowder?

26:46.305 --> 26:47.671
Overload the camera's lithium

26:47.673 --> 26:49.073
ion battery. It'll
give us the explosion

26:49.075 --> 26:51.208
that we need.
Now, Cabe,

26:51.210 --> 26:52.309
tie the vines to
the grappling hook

26:52.311 --> 26:55.245
while Happy
preps the battery.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.382
Now, without instruments to
accurately measure this angle,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.050
I'll have to eyeball it.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.653
But I think we should
be able to hit our mark.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.393
Done. Grappling hook ready.

27:09.395 --> 27:12.062
Done. Thermal runaway
process started.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.264
Okay, Happy, drop the battery
down the hollow log.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.834
Cabe, stick the hook in the top.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.069
Yep.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.749
Hey, how long
before it goes boom?

27:31.751 --> 27:33.484
Unknown.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.218
Could be milliseconds
or it could be...

27:37.023 --> 27:38.956
(hook clangs against metal)
...now.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.025
Did it make it?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.262
HAPPY:
Okay, hook is secure.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.664
Time for exercise, Cabe.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.700
Studies have found
it's good for depression.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.841
All right.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.311
(grunts)

28:10.389 --> 28:12.956
All right, that's a good fire.
Here.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.191
Now we just need to crush 'em,

28:14.193 --> 28:15.793
boil it and get Uncle Toby's

28:15.795 --> 28:17.728
homemade jungle juice
into this fella.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.138
(grunting)

28:38.350 --> 28:39.917
Okay.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.019
Made it.

28:42.021 --> 28:45.155
Now sweep the antenna
around slowly.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.333
I feel like a samurai.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.137
Stop. Hacking the loggers'

29:00.139 --> 29:02.089
database now.

29:02.090 --> 29:04.040
We'll have the location
of the von von tree in no time.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.479
It smells awful.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.247
That should be enough.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.015
(gags)

29:12.017 --> 29:13.317
Smells awful,
but it tastes worse.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.219
Like I tell Ralph, bad taste
means good medicine.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.920
Well, he's a genius.
He doesn't buy that

29:16.922 --> 29:18.472
for one second.
Bottoms up.

29:18.473 --> 29:20.023
WALTER: We hacked the database
and made our way

29:20.025 --> 29:22.259
to a von von tree.
TOBY: All right, fantastic.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.361
Grab some fruit
and let's get cooking up a cure.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.163
Small problem with the fruit.
It's all the way up at the top.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.198
There's no way we're
shooting a vine over that.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.777
Well, if we can't get
up to the fruit,

29:39.779 --> 29:40.778
we'll have to bring it
down to us.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.179
Cabe can shoot it down.

29:42.181 --> 29:46.250
No. It'd just
splatter all over the treetop.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.252
We have to shake it down.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.154
That tree's too big to shake.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.955
We can make the tree
shake itself.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.924
Trees have resonant frequencies,
just like a tuning fork

29:53.926 --> 29:57.027
or idling car engine,
except the tree's is organic.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.395
We can find it,
create vibrations

29:58.397 --> 30:00.347
to match and amplify it.

30:00.348 --> 30:02.298
Causing the tree to vibrate
and shake down all the fruit.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.568
I read an interesting paper
on vibratory fruit harvesting

30:04.570 --> 30:05.903
from Cornell University
that claimed...

30:05.905 --> 30:07.504
PAIGE:
Save the lecture, professor.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.406
We don't have time to discuss
the math of fruit picking.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.507
How do we do it?
HAPPY:
We can't hit the tree

30:10.509 --> 30:12.843
with enough power
and rhythm ourselves.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.128
We need something mechanical.

30:14.129 --> 30:15.412
CABE: In the loggers' camp
there was a buzz saw

30:15.414 --> 30:17.447
that feeds the logs
with a wedge.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.416
I can rig the wedge
to do the job.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.952
Sly, research the von von tree
and find out if anyone

30:21.954 --> 30:23.954
has ever calculated
its resonant frequency.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.990
May take time.
I'm working one-handed.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.359
This bug bite has caused
an odd paralysis.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.930
I got an idea how we can
calculate the tree's

30:32.932 --> 30:35.866
resonant frequency.
It'll take two people.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.835
I'll grab the saw wedge
with the generator.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.036
Doc, you meet me
at the loggers' camp.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.955
TOBY:
On my way.

30:40.956 --> 30:42.873
Keep giving him tea and rubbing
alcohol to his forehead.

30:44.844 --> 30:48.245
Okay. I'll hit the tree with
the hammer at various locations

30:48.247 --> 30:50.581
with a variety of force.
You watch the water bottle

30:50.583 --> 30:52.182
and when the waves on the
water's meniscus peak...

30:52.184 --> 30:53.417
We'll know where
to strike the tree

30:53.419 --> 30:54.985
with the machine.
Let's do it.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.626
WALTER:
That's it.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.000
(chitters)

31:10.002 --> 31:12.636
Why'd you bring
that ugly primate with you?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.404
Don't insult the monkey.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.107
I was talking<i> to</i> the monkey.
(chirping softly)

31:17.109 --> 31:18.375
Camp looks empty.
There's no sign of guards.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.377
Well, if those wasps
were chasing me,

31:20.379 --> 31:21.979
I'd keep running, too.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.047
Let's go.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.586
Unhook that strap.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.592
(gasps) Cabe,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.261
looks like he didn't
keep running after all.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.929
Hide. Over there.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.469
(chirps)

31:49.608 --> 31:51.575
Hold it right there, big fella!

31:52.378 --> 31:53.343
Don't move.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.146
Don't even scratch.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.983
Doc, grab that rope.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.955
(rope creaks)

32:06.992 --> 32:08.492
(screeching)

32:08.494 --> 32:10.594
(grunting)

32:10.596 --> 32:12.296
(shouts)

32:12.298 --> 32:14.231
I-I love apes. Ask the monkey!

32:14.233 --> 32:16.099
(shouts, whimpers)

32:16.101 --> 32:17.367
(grunting)

32:19.538 --> 32:21.071
(buzzing)

32:21.073 --> 32:23.941
(whimpering, grunting)

32:23.943 --> 32:25.409
(shouting, grunting)

32:34.420 --> 32:35.652
No.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.554
(screeching)

32:46.732 --> 32:49.032
You owe that monkey a banana.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.206
(whimpers)

32:56.208 --> 32:58.475
Ralph, my whole arm is
dead. I need an ambulance.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.344
I'm calling 911.
Sylvester, think fast.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.013
How'd you know
I was gonna catch that?

33:03.015 --> 33:05.615
I didn't. But I knew the problem
with your arm was in your head.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.352
It's a harmless
tomato hornworm.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.354
Your reaction
was psychosomatic.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.688
Maybe you feel guilty
about staying behind

33:11.690 --> 33:13.490
while everyone else went
to the Amazon.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.625
TOBY:
Kid's diagnosis is sound.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.495
You know, if Ralph gets sick
of math or physics,

33:18.497 --> 33:20.063
he should study
psychiatry.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.631
Yeah, or become a real doctor.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.633
(clicks)

33:23.635 --> 33:26.136
Hey. Bicker less
and work more.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.510
Work's done.
Timing adjusted.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.245
Okay, the wedge should strike
with the proper frequency

33:35.247 --> 33:37.047
at the optimal spot calculated.

33:37.049 --> 33:38.115
Start it up.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.517
(whirring)

33:40.519 --> 33:43.587
(thumping)

33:45.724 --> 33:47.290
It's not workin'!

33:47.292 --> 33:49.059
Be patient. We're striking it

33:49.061 --> 33:51.128
to amplify
its natural frequency.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.196
In 1831, marching soldiers
created harmonic oscillation

33:53.198 --> 33:54.531
that destroyed
an English bridge.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.133
This has worked before.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.068
Or it was a crappy bridge!

33:58.070 --> 33:59.503
(low rumbling)

34:01.807 --> 34:02.773
It's happening.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.709
Guys, this is bad.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.044
What's bad?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.245
Well, now that I know
I'm not dying,

34:08.246 --> 34:09.445
I am able to look
at my von von tree research.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.482
And it seems it is home to

34:12.484 --> 34:14.151
a deadly species of

34:14.153 --> 34:15.719
the Rhondonian wandering spider.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.237
TOBY: Uh, spiders
are the second most

34:17.238 --> 34:18.754
vibration-sensitive organism
in the world!

34:18.757 --> 34:20.924
CABE:
So by shaking down

34:20.925 --> 34:23.092
the fruit, we're gonna
shake out the spider.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.594
Here they come!

34:24.596 --> 34:25.662
TOBY:
Oh, man, oh, man, big spiders.

34:32.438 --> 34:35.772
♪ ♪

34:35.774 --> 34:36.940
Get off the ground!

34:36.941 --> 34:38.107
I don't know
how you don't know this,

34:38.110 --> 34:39.209
but spiders
can climb, too!

34:39.211 --> 34:40.510
WALTER:
All that matters is that

34:40.512 --> 34:41.445
we're not directly touching
the earth!

34:41.447 --> 34:43.146
HAPPY:
Because it's damp

34:43.148 --> 34:45.082
and conducts electricity!

34:45.084 --> 34:46.550
I'm following
your thinking, Walt.

34:46.552 --> 34:49.753
(zapping)

34:49.755 --> 34:52.155
Spiders
are probably just stunned.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.160
All right, well, let's
shake down the fruit

34:57.162 --> 34:58.328
before they wake up!

34:58.330 --> 35:00.397
On it.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.799
That was crazy.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.404
(zaps)
(screams, grunts)

35:15.114 --> 35:17.881
(weakly):
I can hear the trees talking.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.750
Oh, no,
that's the fever talking.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.286
I don't know
if you can understand, Thiago,

35:23.288 --> 35:26.289
but our team normally comes
through in these situations.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.126
But we've never been up
against the Amazon before.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.694
I'm sorry.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.829
Von von fruit!
Get your von von fruit here!

35:32.831 --> 35:35.365
I never doubted
them for a second.
WALTER: Okay!

35:35.367 --> 35:37.467
Cut one open!
Let's get some in Thiago!

35:37.469 --> 35:39.569
(panting)

35:44.409 --> 35:45.842
You do the honors.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.916
How long
before we know?

35:52.918 --> 35:54.651
He's getting pure juice
directly under his tongue.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.752
Sublingual absorption

35:55.754 --> 35:57.137
of a liquid is rapid,

35:57.138 --> 35:58.521
and the antivirals
in this fruit are potent.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.825
So we should see a physiological
response quickly.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.660
What if it doesn't work?
Then we failed
to find the cure.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.794
And then he dies,

36:04.796 --> 36:06.263
along with who knows
how many more.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.731
Not goo...
(grunts)

36:08.567 --> 36:09.766
See? I can't even say my thing,

36:09.768 --> 36:11.268
'cause I think
I'm gonna get clicked.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.936
Da-da-da-da! Yell at me later,
'cause right now

36:12.938 --> 36:15.472
I'm feeling a heart rate that
is slowing down and steadying!

36:15.474 --> 36:16.874
This is a good sign, guys!

36:16.875 --> 36:18.275
This is very good!
CABE: We've all been exposed.

36:18.277 --> 36:21.411
It'd be prudent for us all
to eat some. Here.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.418
Oh, that is awful.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.925
Oh. I can feel
my taste buds dying.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.694
I like it.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.695
(chirping)

36:38.697 --> 36:39.963
Oh. Hey, Simian Freud.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.765
Want a bite?

36:44.636 --> 36:45.802
Share it.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.370
(chirps)

36:54.880 --> 36:56.813
Thanks for nothing, quack!

36:56.815 --> 36:58.215
We're worse off
than before

36:58.217 --> 36:59.916
we came here.
Wow,

36:59.918 --> 37:00.917
32 clicks!

37:00.919 --> 37:02.919
That's a new record!

37:02.921 --> 37:04.921
Not 32. It hit 99
and then turned over.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.389
It's 131 clicks.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.657
Really great work, Cecil.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.659
All you proven is
that the woman I'm gonna marry

37:09.661 --> 37:11.261
drives me crazy.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.462
Oh, Tobias,

37:12.464 --> 37:14.431
you already knew
she was driving you crazy.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.601
But you left out a
<i> really</i> important word.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.337
You said, the woman
you're going to marry.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.440
What you should've said is,
the woman you're<i> still</i>

37:23.442 --> 37:24.908
going to marry,

37:24.910 --> 37:27.310
despite her... stunted

37:27.312 --> 37:28.878
emotional growth

37:28.880 --> 37:29.913
and apparent nastiness

37:29.915 --> 37:32.315
and your Pollyanna approach

37:32.317 --> 37:35.418
to this relationship
and that stupid hat,

37:35.420 --> 37:36.820
you're still
getting married.

37:36.822 --> 37:40.824
After 131 clicks.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.460
Means you love each other,

37:43.462 --> 37:44.894
made for
each other.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.997
Whatever you two
have, it works.

37:46.999 --> 37:50.000
Don't change a thing.

37:50.002 --> 37:54.638
You are gonna be<i> great </i>
as husband and wife.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.540
My bill.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.543
And you're welcome.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.447
He's good.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.450
(grunts)

38:08.520 --> 38:09.753
You're dismantling it?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.354
(grunts)

38:11.356 --> 38:13.890
I realized
no matter how much

38:13.892 --> 38:15.825
I try to avoid my fears,

38:15.827 --> 38:18.561
they'll still find me,
even if they're not real.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.063
So why not face 'em head-on?

38:21.400 --> 38:24.868
(grunts) I am moving
my garden to the rooftop.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.437
(grunts)
Real potted soil.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.339
Time to get
my hands dirty.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.474
Or gloves.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.642
Probably wear the gloves.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.377
Get the gloves dirty.

38:34.379 --> 38:35.679
Baby steps,

38:35.681 --> 38:37.614
Walter.
Baby steps, Sly.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.850
TOBY: Hey,
new haircut!

38:40.852 --> 38:42.552
HAPPY:
Nice.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.420
Handsome kid.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.388
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.724
Excellent choice.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.024
No more using the blue bowl.
SYLVESTER: Good!

38:49.027 --> 38:50.493
'Cause I destroyed it.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.562
Couldn't have it in the kitchen

38:52.564 --> 38:54.014
contaminating the other bowls.

38:54.015 --> 38:55.465
Plus, I got some of the blue
liquid they put combs in.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.017
Its active ingredient is

38:57.018 --> 38:58.568
alkyldimethylbenzylammonium
chloride.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.670
Thought we could do
some experiments.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.971
Sweet.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.474
Paige,

39:04.476 --> 39:06.476
how's the new do
affecting you?

39:06.478 --> 39:07.644
Well, change is inevitable.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.296
Sometimes it's bad,

39:09.297 --> 39:10.947
like a virus mutating
from monkeys to humans.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.749
And sometimes it's good,

39:12.751 --> 39:15.118
like a fruit evolving
to combat sickness.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.421
No matter what, though, change
is gonna happen. In the end,

39:18.423 --> 39:20.423
I know Ralph is old enough
to make his own choices.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.759
But I just wish

39:22.761 --> 39:23.993
he didn't want
to change

39:23.995 --> 39:26.062
to match what he thinks
the world wants.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.365
CABE:
Nice lid, kid.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.833
That's gonna get all the girls.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.034
I don't care
about that.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.702
My old hair was preventing
my lab goggles

39:32.704 --> 39:34.537
from creating
a proper face seal.

39:39.111 --> 39:40.844
What was that for?

39:40.846 --> 39:43.380
For not changing too much.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.449
Just got off the phone
with Dr. Silva.

39:46.451 --> 39:47.617
Thiago's gonna be fine.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.985
And when the
Rhondonian government

39:48.987 --> 39:51.554
went back into the jungle
to collect more fruit

39:51.556 --> 39:53.790
to make medicine,
they busted the loggers.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.792
Ah. We saved some lives,

39:55.794 --> 39:57.627
saved some trees.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.728
And Toby made a new friend.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.997
I miss my monkey.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.632
CABE:
Well, I'm gonna
gather my stuff

40:02.634 --> 40:04.117
and head on home.

40:04.118 --> 40:05.601
I got a TV dinner there
with my name on it.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.537
Can't be worse
than the von von fruit.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.007
Have a nice night, gang.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.454
I'm gonna ask Cabe if he wants
to hang out tonight.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.889
He still misses Allie.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.957
I think he could use a friend.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.097
I'll do it.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.167
It's kind of my job to take care
of the team emotionally.

40:37.169 --> 40:38.768
No, I'll do it.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.838
He's hurting, inside.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.541
I think I can help him.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.817
That was empathy.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.820
Walter identified emotional
pain in someone else

40:56.822 --> 40:59.456
and demonstrated
empathy.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.058
You can't empathize
if you haven't been through

41:02.060 --> 41:04.661
a similar situation yourself.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.897
Walter wasn't just being jealous
or petty about Tim, was he?

41:07.899 --> 41:10.834
No, he wasn't.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.769
I know you didn't
mean to, but...

41:12.771 --> 41:14.237
you must've really broken
his heart.

41:14.239 --> 41:17.507
And now he knows
what that feels like,

41:17.509 --> 41:19.876
and he is applying that data
to someone else.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.479
Well, Ralph may
not be changing,

41:22.481 --> 41:25.682
but Walter certainly is. Hmm.
