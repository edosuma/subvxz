Dive in.
[ Swirling ]

10:03.103 --> 10:05.370
I don't feel comfortable
diving into a face.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.741
Dog, let's go back
for apricot pie.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.409
Yeah, pie!

10:11.411 --> 10:12.444
[ Thwap! ]
[ Grunts ]

10:12.446 --> 10:13.578
[ Thwap! ]
Gross!

10:13.580 --> 10:16.581
WhOoooa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:16.583 --> 10:18.149
[ Splash! ]

10:23.823 --> 10:27.592
Jake: And there was, like,
a PB puddle, a Marceline plant,

10:27.594 --> 10:29.761
and a little bee that looked
like you, BMO!

10:29.763 --> 10:32.897
You know what?
We didn't save the Sea Lard.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.733
The Sea Lard saved us.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.835
Yay, Sea Lard!

10:36.837 --> 10:38.603
Wow.
What an adventure.

10:38.605 --> 10:42.273
And there was even a purple lady
kind of like you, Ice King.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.942
She even sounded
just like you.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.278
She sounds magnificent!
How'd you say you got there?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.681
We didn't.
Beat it, creep.

10:49.683 --> 10:50.982
I'll figure it out.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.752
But, Simon, if you go there,
you'll lose your memories.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.188
What memories?
I'm like a goldfish over here.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.790
In what way, exactly?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.792
Hmm?
Oh, hey, Jake.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.960
Where am I?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.462
Comfy, dude?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.364
I bet you ran away 'cause
we didn't appreciate you

11:06.366 --> 11:08.133
and called you gross
and stuff.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.668
But you're not gross.

11:09.670 --> 11:10.669
[ Smooches ]

11:10.671 --> 11:12.337
Good night, Sea Lard.

11:19.011 --> 11:22.981
Come along with me

11:22.983 --> 11:27.552
And the butterflies and bees
