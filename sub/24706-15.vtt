SIMONE: You'll find the
other half of this message...

00:05.973 --> 00:07.564
...when you find the other half
of this couple.

00:07.733 --> 00:09.052
Think Webster's back?

00:09.213 --> 00:10.851
My daughter is dead.

00:11.013 --> 00:12.002
I have a right to know...

00:12.173 --> 00:14.926
...what you're working on.
SIMONE: Yes, you do, sir.

00:15.093 --> 00:19.530
Whoever it is, I'll give you
$ 1 million to kill him.

00:19.693 --> 00:23.049
I guess I was hoping that maybe
you'd be interested in seeing me again.

00:23.213 --> 00:24.362
I don't think so.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.763
- How are you?
- Harold Rutansky called me.

00:26.973 --> 00:29.123
- No!
- You were spying on me?

00:29.293 --> 00:31.602
No. Not spying.

00:31.773 --> 00:34.651
Well, what do you call it, Gregory?
You followed me.

00:34.813 --> 00:40.206
It is not your asthma or your rashes
or your food allergies.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.250
It's your attitude, Gregory.

00:42.973 --> 00:46.648
- What's wrong with my attitude?
- You won't enjoy your life.

00:46.813 --> 00:51.045
So if you don't mind me saying,
I enjoy working with you.

00:51.533 --> 00:54.286
No. I enjoy working with you too.

SIMONE: Get up against the wall!

- It's a match, George.

01:00.653 --> 01:04.771
We matched it to the Webster shootings
just like you knew we would.

01:04.933 --> 01:06.286
We got you, George.

Another button's missing.

anybody will notice a missing button.

I was thinking of my problems.

He grabs me, puts me in trunk.

I cannot believe
that one minor error in judgment...

05:16.413 --> 05:20.406
...could prove fatal to our relationship.
- I'm going to my desk.

05:20.573 --> 05:24.566
- Does it hurt you to talk to me?
- It hurts that you don't trust me.

- I made a mistake.
- Look, I need some time.

05:28.293 --> 05:30.807
Would you back off
and give me that?

All right. All right.

to get all vehement at me.

Mrs. Lee, you want to come with me?

05:38.453 --> 05:41.809
I never saw him before.
I was just walking.

- Where were you going, Mrs. Lee?
- I was coming from bank...

05:45.213 --> 05:46.441
...going to my sister's.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.810
- Only block away.
- Yeah.

05:48.973 --> 05:53.842
- Did you see him following you?
- No. He was leaning on a car.

05:54.013 --> 05:57.562
When I go to walk past, he grabs me.

05:57.773 --> 05:59.889
I tell him,
"Take money. Leave me alone."

06:00.053 --> 06:03.489
- Did he say anything?
- He accused me. He say I follow him.

06:03.653 --> 06:06.611
I do not understand him so well.
He speak foreign.

06:06.773 --> 06:08.684
And puts me right in trunk.

06:10.533 --> 06:15.732
After he picked you up at Union Square,
about how long did you drive around?

06:15.893 --> 06:19.568
- Two hours, maybe more.
- Did he stop the car at any point?

06:19.733 --> 06:24.602
Once he stop and waited.
Then he drove again.

06:24.773 --> 06:28.652
Stop again.
I could hear airplanes.

06:28.813 --> 06:32.123
Then he drives again
until he hits your car.

06:32.293 --> 06:35.922
- And he never interfered with you?
- He puts me in the trunk!

06:36.093 --> 06:38.368
But he didn't touch you sexually?

06:38.533 --> 06:45.006
No. But who knows? Maybe later.
I think he's wacko! Do you think so?

06:45.173 --> 06:48.006
Well, yeah, I think there's
a good chance that he is.

06:48.213 --> 06:51.808
Now, you understand that this man
is not gonna get out of here?

06:51.973 --> 06:54.123
You have nothing more
to fear from him.

06:54.293 --> 06:58.809
I am not afraid of him.

- Put him in the cage. I'll be back.
MARTINEZ: Yeah, okay.

07:33.093 --> 07:37.132
Before Putnam graduated to serial killer,
he pulled a few stickup homicides.

- What are we looking at?
- Two homicides from seven years ago.

Witnesses spotted him on TV,
called in and said he was the guy.

to be involved in it.

Actually, you're the first person
I thought of.

08:48.253 --> 08:51.404
I'll check policy on this after the trial
and get back to you.

13:40.373 --> 13:41.965
Why was that woman in your trunk?

13:42.133 --> 13:46.251
You see a poor man on the street,
in winter, starving and no place to sleep.

13:46.413 --> 13:49.564
You do nothing, he dies. Is that crime?

13:49.733 --> 13:51.724
In America, that is no crime!

13:51.893 --> 13:55.249
How about you get off the soapbox
and tell me what you do for a living.

13:55.413 --> 14:00.726
I am a busboy. I pick up the dirty plates
of the rich pigs that you work for.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.450
I work for the city of New York, asshole.

14:04.613 --> 14:06.569
Now, why did you take that woman?

14:06.733 --> 14:08.883
Yes, please. Call me asshole.

14:09.053 --> 14:13.126
If I were rich, I would not even be here.
And you, you would call me sir!

14:13.293 --> 14:18.128
Hey! You had explosives in your car.
You had a woman in the trunk.

14:18.293 --> 14:22.127
Now, you are in looking at a lot of jail
if we don't stick to the topic here!

14:22.293 --> 14:26.889
Explosives? Just fireworks.
Romanians celebrate with fireworks.

14:27.053 --> 14:30.125
Independence of our country
from the Ottoman Empire.

14:30.293 --> 14:33.808
The coronation of King Carol I,
many holidays.

14:33.973 --> 14:38.012
I safely celebrate Romanian holiday,
but not the king.

14:38.173 --> 14:40.562
Why were handcuffs
on the handle of your briefcase?

14:40.733 --> 14:44.521
I handcuff device to my wrist
during transport to avoid theft.

14:44.693 --> 14:47.571
You know what I think?
I think you're full of crap.

14:47.733 --> 14:50.964
- Sipowicz. Is that right? Sipowicz?
- Right.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.363
I think you don't think.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.683
I think you are Polack.

14:57.053 --> 14:59.089
That's right. I'm a Polack.

14:59.253 --> 15:02.643
At times I've been deeply wounded
by unthinking remarks.

15:02.813 --> 15:06.488
But somehow I find the strength
to go on.

15:06.653 --> 15:09.963
Now, how about you telling me
about that woman in your trunk?

15:11.573 --> 15:14.565
Sure, why not.
I meet her on the street.

15:14.733 --> 15:18.772
We are talking. It becomes clear to me
she has thoughts of self-destruction.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.286
She was gonna kill herself?

15:20.453 --> 15:23.331
Yes. She was despondent
over the degradation of the masses.

15:23.493 --> 15:24.926
- You met this woman before?
- No.

15:25.093 --> 15:29.166
But we have shared in being oppressed
as newcomers to this country.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.608
So I put her in trunk
to take her to hospital.

15:31.773 --> 15:35.846
You see, I can't take chance that she
despairs and leaps out of car into traffic.

15:36.013 --> 15:37.241
That would be horrible.

15:37.413 --> 15:42.726
So I am en route to care facility when,
boom, I encounter you.

15:42.893 --> 15:48.650
That's a great explanation, Illiescu.
You're a real human benefactor.

15:48.813 --> 15:51.247
Yes, more people should be like me.

15:51.413 --> 15:54.849
So I can go now, yes?

15:56.933 --> 16:01.085
Shots came from the roof across the
street. It's accessible by four buildings.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.972
The murder weapon
is an H & K 91, Pentax scope.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.010
That's a very expensive piece there.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.812
- Any prints?
- Wiped clean, not even a partial.

16:08.973 --> 16:11.567
Look. You see this gun?
This has been around, man.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.769
But that scope right there,
that's brand-new.

16:13.933 --> 16:16.527
We got the manufacturer working off
the serial numbers...

16:16.693 --> 16:18.285
...to trace it to a retailer.

16:18.453 --> 16:21.413
- What about the canvass?
SIMONE: Nothing, so far.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.323
- What about the canvass?
SIMONE: Nothing, so far.

16:22.493 --> 16:25.326
One resident was on the roof
smoking a joint two hours before.

16:25.493 --> 16:27.961
He says nobody was up there.
He didn't see anything.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.886
Medavoy and Martinez
are checking adjacent buildings...

16:31.093 --> 16:32.526
...the MTA and the cab companies.

16:32.693 --> 16:35.491
The good news is 800 people
would like to see this scum dead.

16:35.653 --> 16:37.723
You got anything I can tell Aiello?

16:40.053 --> 16:42.442
I don't know
if this is something to tell Aiello...

16:42.613 --> 16:44.922
...but when we first picked up Putnam,
Rudman...

16:45.093 --> 16:47.209
...throws out this number
for me to whack him.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.968
- I figure he's upset so I let it pass.
- And he was here when Putnam got hit.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.806
He set up
a victim's assistance foundation.

16:53.973 --> 16:56.567
It gives him a reason
to talk to the victims' families.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.201
I got Mrs. Wilson out there right now.
[KNOCKING]

16:59.373 --> 17:01.568
- Yeah?
- Illiescu claims that he put the woman...

17:01.733 --> 17:06.443
...in the trunk to prevent her from killing
herself. Massive act of compassion.

17:06.613 --> 17:09.445
I talked to the DA, the warrant's
approved on his apartment.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.410
- I'm on my way. Is it Putnam?
- Yeah.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.212
FANCY: Have the bomb squad meet you.
- Yeah.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.449
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.810
I heard you were there
when Putnam got shot.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.089
Me and Greg were gonna
transport him to Rikers.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.131
- I'm glad the perp was a good shot.
- I'm glad you're glad.

17:26.292 --> 17:29.808
- James? You got anything on the scope?
MARTINEZ: Yeah.

17:29.973 --> 17:31.929
Let me see my notes.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.812
Shipped to the R&S Sportsman's Shop
in Yonkers.

17:34.973 --> 17:37.487
The manager's checking records
to find out when it was sold.

17:37.653 --> 17:40.121
I'm gonna see if I can get a description
on the buyer.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.612
Good deal. All right.

17:41.773 --> 17:44.162
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

17:44.333 --> 17:48.565
You were talking about the meetings
Rudman organized for the families.

17:48.733 --> 17:52.248
He's been very helpful, supportive.

17:52.413 --> 17:55.086
I think those meetings
have done us all a lot of good.

17:55.253 --> 17:57.209
What happens at the meetings?

17:57.373 --> 18:00.490
We talk about our children.

18:00.653 --> 18:02.325
Our feelings now that they're gone.

18:02.773 --> 18:04.889
Does anyone ever...?

18:05.053 --> 18:07.123
Do you talk about retribution or revenge?

18:07.293 --> 18:09.011
Not really.

18:10.653 --> 18:14.328
- Only once in a while. It's only natural.
- Sure.

18:16.013 --> 18:19.244
Who do you remember
talking about that?

18:21.693 --> 18:24.082
Mr. Rudman, Mr. Sandquist.

18:24.253 --> 18:26.164
They did most of the talking.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.450
Mr. Sandquist was very outspoken.

18:29.613 --> 18:32.491
His daughter was also killed by Putnam.

DANA: How are you doing?

18:49.933 --> 18:53.767
It must have been so frightening today,
that guy getting shot.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.401
To tell you the truth,
I haven't thought about that.

18:56.573 --> 18:58.643
I've got these other things on my mind.

18:58.813 --> 19:01.168
Take off your coat.
I'll get you a glass of wine.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.370
Yeah. You know, I'm helping Andy
to search an apartment.

19:04.533 --> 19:07.570
A glass of water would be great.

19:10.653 --> 19:13.963
So I guess you haven't talked to Donna?

19:14.133 --> 19:17.330
- You guys aren't getting along?
- What did she say?

19:17.493 --> 19:20.769
Nothing. But you called me.
I mean, you never call me.

19:20.933 --> 19:26.326
- So I figured you guys had a fight.
- Yeah. She's very upset.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.652
Oh, boy.

19:32.293 --> 19:33.328
She...

19:33.493 --> 19:37.088
- She went out with this other guy.
- Let me guess.

19:37.253 --> 19:41.087
Dentures, stitch line over the eye and
hemorrhoids from sitting on the bench?

19:41.653 --> 19:43.848
Yeah. I mean,
she says he's just an old friend.

19:44.013 --> 19:47.369
But I got very angry.
I guess I overreacted.

19:47.533 --> 19:50.969

it's your fault she's seeing another guy.

No. No, I believe that, you know,
there was nothing to it...

19:58.933 --> 20:02.972
...but I can't seem to talk to her now.

20:05.733 --> 20:07.803
You know, if you could talk to her...

20:09.133 --> 20:11.522
She'd never listen to me.

20:11.693 --> 20:13.285
She knows how I feel.

- How you feel?
- I'll level, Gregory.

He was shot right outside

- I was at my place.

- Mm-hm. What were your whereabouts?
- I was at my place.

- No. She was at her dialysis clinic.

down the name of the clinic for me?

- At 9:00 I was watching TV.

- Did I say it happened at 9?
- I know I heard it somewhere.

Why don't you make up your mind
on that? We'll take a break.

We've been out to your place, Illiescu.

So now you know
I am ordinary man, a worker.

25:18.253 --> 25:20.483
Are you a communist?

25:20.653 --> 25:23.929

do not interest me.

25:24.093 --> 25:25.651
That's good.

25:25.813 --> 25:29.362
Because if I thought you were some
kind of aggrieved Third World piss pot...

25:29.533 --> 25:32.127
...I'd have to get the Anti-Terrorism

25:32.293 --> 25:34.363

from the dream...

25:34.533 --> 25:36.364
...the nightmare of America.

25:36.533 --> 25:39.923
I saw the bombs you built, Mr. Illiescu.

25:41.213 --> 25:43.522
- Yes?
- You're obviously an intelligent man...

25:43.693 --> 25:47.572
...to be able to put all that together.
- Yet, here I am, just a busboy.

25:47.733 --> 25:49.610
There's also a list of prominent people.

25:49.773 --> 25:51.729

very thorough.

...they divorce in one year!

People who look past you
when you walk on the street!

26:02.653 --> 26:04.564
Why are they on a list?

26:04.733 --> 26:06.769
I'm cataloging atrocities
of the ruling class.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.810
If justice ever comes to this country...

26:08.973 --> 26:11.282
...they will be held accountable
for their actions.

26:11.853 --> 26:13.605
But these are just dreams.

26:13.773 --> 26:18.130
In actuality, I have done nothing.
So it is not serious.

26:18.293 --> 26:19.567
You didn't harm Mrs. Lee.

26:19.733 --> 26:23.123
I finished the bombs.
And I feel very satisfied, very good.

26:23.293 --> 26:26.490
So I pick up woman.
Later I was going to party with her.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.166
- Party with her?
- Of course.

26:28.333 --> 26:33.282
Drink some wine, make a meal,
screw her. Good times.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.485
Okay.

26:37.533 --> 26:41.765
You're a well-spoken man, Mr. Illiescu.
Can you write all this down yourself?

26:41.933 --> 26:45.289
I'm educated. I can write it.
After I write it, I pay you fine and go.

26:45.453 --> 26:46.693
I have $80 with me.
200 more at home. You can come.

26:46.693 --> 26:48.524
I have $80 with me.
200 more at home. You can come.

26:48.693 --> 26:52.163
Before I take money from you,
should we talk about anything else?

26:52.333 --> 26:56.042
I get the feeling there's a little more
you want to tell me.

26:56.213 --> 26:59.683
- No. That is everything.
- Make sure it is.

26:59.853 --> 27:03.562
Otherwise I'll kick this thing to the FBI,
the CIA, and you and I...

27:03.733 --> 27:06.088
...won't be talking man-to-man anymore.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.211
- Anything off the canvass?
SIMONE: The canvass came up empty.

27:18.373 --> 27:21.171
- Anything on the weapon?
- The serial number was filed off.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.642
James tracked the scope
to a shop in Yonkers.

27:23.813 --> 27:26.202
Rudman bought the scope,
but he didn't do the murder.

27:26.373 --> 27:28.682
What about the Sandquist girl's father?
Like him?

27:28.853 --> 27:32.323
Yes. He gave me a rehearsed alibi,
had a lawyer's card in his pocket.

27:32.493 --> 27:36.202
- He was in the service, he knows rifles.
- Are you giving him a coffee break?

27:36.373 --> 27:39.968
He was about to lawyer up. I don't want
to pressure him. I think he'll talk.

27:40.133 --> 27:41.532
FANCY:
All right. Keep me posted.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.206
DONNA:
Can I help you?

27:43.373 --> 27:45.443
They told me I should talk to a detective.

27:45.613 --> 27:48.173
- Regarding?
- It's about that shooting this morning.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.370
You know, how that Webster guy
was killed over here.

27:51.533 --> 27:54.923
Detective, this man has some
information on the Putnam shooting.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.646
Come on in.

27:57.293 --> 27:58.806
- Detective Simone.
- Walter Roach.

27:58.973 --> 28:01.362
SIMONE:
How you doing? Have a seat.

28:06.213 --> 28:08.807
Oh, boy. Now I feel like an idiot.

28:08.973 --> 28:10.770
What information
do you have, Mr. Roach?

28:10.933 --> 28:13.970
- I gotta tell you?
- Yeah. I'd like you to.

28:14.133 --> 28:17.682
Well, see, I'm a driver
for Speedway Cabs.

28:17.893 --> 28:20.123
And our dispatcher
was saying how the police...

28:20.293 --> 28:25.162
...were interested in suspicious fares
we picked up in the vicinity this morning.

28:25.333 --> 28:30.851
And I remember this guy I picked up
right after 9:00 on 2nd Avenue.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.652
- How he was sweated and worked up.
- What did he look like?

28:33.853 --> 28:35.366
It's my mistake.

28:35.533 --> 28:37.967
What's wrong?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.852
- I think he's a cop.
- Why?

28:41.213 --> 28:43.932
Because he's sitting right
in that room over there.

28:44.813 --> 28:46.644
- That's the guy you picked up?
- Yeah.

28:46.813 --> 28:49.930
- Come on.
- What?

28:50.973 --> 28:51.962
SERGEANT: Right here.
- Here?

28:52.133 --> 28:55.091
DONNA: I'll give this to the lieutenant.
SERGEANT: Right. You got it.

28:55.253 --> 28:56.845
DONNA:
Okay.

28:57.013 --> 28:59.447
- Hi.
DANA: Hi.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.491
- Well, you can congratulate me.
DONNA: You got the job?

29:02.653 --> 29:04.371
It looks very, very good.

29:04.533 --> 29:08.003
Mr. Fineman, the vice president
of acquisitions, wants me back...

29:08.173 --> 29:12.689
...for a final interview. They have to talk
to the other applicants, but he said...

29:13.293 --> 29:15.602
...it's just a formality.

29:15.773 --> 29:17.729
That's great.

29:17.933 --> 29:22.882
Um, actually, that's not why I'm here.
I'm here about Greg.

29:24.213 --> 29:27.125
- He called me.
- Uh-huh.

29:28.253 --> 29:32.041
He's very upset about
what's happening in your relationship.

29:32.213 --> 29:34.681
- He called you about that?
- Yeah.

29:34.853 --> 29:38.289
Well, he felt since we're sisters,
I could talk to you.

29:38.453 --> 29:42.765
You should try and be fair with this guy,
whatever you're up to with Harold.

29:42.933 --> 29:48.291
I mean, I look at him, Donna,
and I see devastation in his face.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.011
When did you look at him?

29:51.413 --> 29:55.770
He came by. This isn't something
that we could talk about on the phone.

29:55.933 --> 29:58.686
You know, Dana,
this has a very familiar ring to it.

30:01.493 --> 30:03.643
Is this the thanks I get?

30:03.813 --> 30:07.123
You're the one that's made a mess
of things. I'm just trying to help.

30:07.293 --> 30:09.443
Do me a favor, Dana. Don't help.

30:11.733 --> 30:13.849
If that's the way you want it.

30:18.973 --> 30:20.122
SIMONE:
Yeah. Well, that's good.

30:20.293 --> 30:24.809
Yeah, all right. Well, they got you
traveling around. Come on back in. Later.

30:24.973 --> 30:27.362
James just called from
a rifle range in Garden City.

30:27.533 --> 30:29.922
A guy remembers Sandquist
coming in to sight his rifle.

30:30.093 --> 30:32.049
FANCY: Is he bringing him in for an ID?
SIMONE: Better.

30:32.213 --> 30:36.525
They got him on the security camera
tape. I'm going to talk to him now.

30:42.373 --> 30:45.251
- Make up your mind?
- I don't know.

30:46.613 --> 30:49.002
I think you want to talk.

30:49.173 --> 30:50.811
I think that deep down you know...

30:51.013 --> 30:53.686
...how important it is to help us
find out who did this.

30:53.853 --> 30:54.853
You think I'd help you?

30:54.853 --> 30:55.842
You think I'd help you?

30:56.013 --> 30:58.447
You think the person
who did this should be punished?

30:58.653 --> 31:03.886
Mr. Sandquist, I'd like to get into
a discussion with you about this here...

31:04.053 --> 31:06.169
...but I can't talk with you...

31:06.853 --> 31:09.048
...unless you decline legal counsel.

31:09.213 --> 31:10.885
Okay.

31:12.373 --> 31:15.171
Okay, you decline legal counsel?

31:15.333 --> 31:16.971
Yes.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.210
Tell me what you think.

31:22.373 --> 31:24.841
I think whoever shot that slime
is a hero.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.481
A hero? He was in custody.
He was on his way to jail.

31:28.093 --> 31:30.243
Great system we got, isn't it?

31:30.413 --> 31:31.812
My daughter's in the ground...

31:31.973 --> 31:35.602
...and he gets free food and medical
for life. You call that justice?

31:35.773 --> 31:39.129
Hey, I know what a scumbag
this guy was. I took him off the street.

31:39.293 --> 31:40.772
I got a stake in this too.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.970
Yeah, well, getting shot
is what he deserved.

31:44.133 --> 31:48.251
Not parading around on TV, writing
books. Getting paid for what he did.

31:48.413 --> 31:51.530
You don't think I'd like
the death penalty for this guy? I would.

31:51.693 --> 31:54.082
But until that comes,
I work with the laws that we got.

31:54.253 --> 31:58.405
I promise you, 99 percent of the people
in this city are glad he's dead.

31:58.573 --> 32:02.327
You're probably right.
And I still have to find out who did it.

32:02.493 --> 32:05.451
So let me tell you what I know,
Mr. Sandquist.

32:05.613 --> 32:07.524
I know what you lied about
this morning.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.843
You weren't home
watching <i>Regis and Kathie Lee.</i>

32:10.013 --> 32:12.368
We have witnesses
that saw you leaving the scene.

32:12.533 --> 32:15.889
We have tape of you sighting in
the murder weapon at a shooting range.

32:16.053 --> 32:19.648
I also know that there are
other people that are involved with this.

32:19.813 --> 32:23.010
Detective, I got no problem
with what I did.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.892
And if I have to pay the price,
I'll pay it.

32:26.053 --> 32:28.772
There is no reason you
should take the fall for this alone.

32:28.933 --> 32:32.972
Listen to me. You want a confession?
I confess.

32:33.133 --> 32:35.363
I killed him.
Now go ahead and lock me up.

32:35.533 --> 32:38.001
- What did Rudman have to do with this?
- Nothing.

32:38.173 --> 32:40.846
I know a jury is gonna
sympathize with you.

32:41.013 --> 32:43.481
You're probably not gonna serve
a lot of time on this.

32:43.653 --> 32:46.804
But the rifle scope that you used
was purchased by Arnold Rudman.

32:46.973 --> 32:48.929
Now, I do not believe
in coincidences, Roy.

32:49.133 --> 32:52.489
- I think that he gave you that scope.
- I bought it on the street.

32:52.653 --> 32:56.168
I think Rudman got you the lawyer,
$ 1000 rifle...

32:56.333 --> 32:59.086
...and we talked with
your wife's dialysis clinic.

32:59.253 --> 33:01.687
Now, starting next week,
she's switching to a fancy...

33:01.853 --> 33:05.528
...private hospital for her treatments.
Now, is Rudman paying for that too?

33:06.373 --> 33:09.365
You want me
to write my confession now?

33:24.173 --> 33:26.004

33:26.173 --> 33:30.166
Yeah. He put himself in on kidnapping
and possession of explosives.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.846
So we're done with this guy?

33:32.013 --> 33:35.847
I don't think so. He had a list
of names, addresses, schedules.

33:37.813 --> 33:42.170
- He was in the process of something.
- You think he's got bombs out there?

33:54.853 --> 33:58.971
This is good, yes? No FBI, no CIA.

34:03.813 --> 34:07.169
I don't see anything about that briefcase
or why you were at the airport.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.324
- Airport? Today?
- Our people saw you there, Vartan.

34:10.493 --> 34:12.882
I did nothing at airport.
Ask who saw me.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.964
What were you trying to do?

34:17.453 --> 34:19.920
I'm not happy with that answer.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.402
You cannot know what is in my mind.

34:23.813 --> 34:27.851
I may have to spread your brains
around this room and look through them.

34:28.013 --> 34:31.210
I cannot be detained
for what I plan.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.568
Maybe so. Let's hear.

They have mercury switches
so that if the people move, boom.

34:51.813 --> 34:57.092
Also, I would hook them to timer
so that if I do not return in time, boom.

34:57.253 --> 34:58.811
And the briefcase bomb?

34:58.973 --> 35:01.771
Briefcase I would handcuff
to wrist of head of household...

who deserved to pay me.

- This was only plan.
- What were you doing at the airport?

35:16.413 --> 35:20.201
Checking super-saver to Bucharest
on Tarom Romanian Airline.

35:20.373 --> 35:22.762

You know how I wired those people.

...is the way Illiescu think
about the rich, garbage.

- You can tell your cellmate all about it.
- You think you are big hero now, yes?

38:04.413 --> 38:07.052
Because beating me,
you have saved some rich people.

38:07.213 --> 38:09.363
You only do that...
You could only beat me...

It's a long way for lunch.

39:35.693 --> 39:39.732
I mean dinner. Like tonight.
Unless you got something going.

39:39.893 --> 39:41.645
I don't think that's a good idea.

39:41.813 --> 39:45.852
I sort of have a rule about not
getting involved with anyone on the job.

39:46.013 --> 39:47.765
Because of Jimmy Abruzzo?

39:47.933 --> 39:50.606
I don't think it works to socialize
with someone on the job.

39:50.773 --> 39:54.322
- All right. Well, then I quit.
- Don't quit.

39:55.933 --> 39:58.925
You mean, even if I quit,
it wouldn't work?

39:59.093 --> 40:01.049
No.

40:01.653 --> 40:03.405
I'll see you in the morning?

40:03.573 --> 40:05.643
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:14.053 --> 40:15.452
Why are you here, Mr. Rudman?

40:15.613 --> 40:17.888
- We're here to see Mr. Sandquist.
- Who's this?

40:18.053 --> 40:20.567
Charles Emory, counsel for
the Alexandra Rudman Foundation...

40:20.773 --> 40:23.082
...in which capacity,
he's representing Mr. Sandquist.

40:23.253 --> 40:25.369
Mr. Sandquist has declined
legal counsel.

40:25.533 --> 40:27.330
Has he confessed?

40:28.013 --> 40:31.847
He's writing up his statement. But I have
some questions I'd like you to answer.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.332
He has nothing to say to you.

40:33.493 --> 40:36.883
- This guy's representing you?
- I have no need for an attorney.

40:38.213 --> 40:40.807
Then you won't mind talking to me.

40:45.813 --> 40:47.485
Of course not.

40:47.653 --> 40:50.087
EMORY: Arnold...
- It's all right, Charles.

40:50.253 --> 40:53.325
- I have nothing to hide.
- Right in here.

40:59.853 --> 41:02.731
[THUNDER ROLLING]

41:09.293 --> 41:14.128
You bought a rifle scope at the R&S
Sportsman's Shop last month.

41:16.053 --> 41:17.566
Yes.

41:17.733 --> 41:22.045
I purchased it as a birthday gift
for my brother.

41:22.213 --> 41:22.693
He's an avid deer hunter.

41:22.693 --> 41:24.251
He's an avid deer hunter.

41:24.653 --> 41:26.530
Have you recovered it?

41:26.693 --> 41:28.285
Recovered it?

41:28.453 --> 41:32.002
It was stolen from my townhouse
with other articles a few weeks ago.

41:32.173 --> 41:35.324
I filed a stolen property report
in the 18th Precinct.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.802
A Sgt. Conroy, I believe.

41:38.613 --> 41:41.332
Gotta give it to you, Mr. Rudman.

41:42.013 --> 41:43.412
I don't know what you mean.

41:43.573 --> 41:45.768
You decide Putnam should be executed...

41:45.933 --> 41:48.766
...you buy yourself a little justice.

41:49.253 --> 41:51.244
That's what I mean.

41:53.013 --> 41:58.849
If you think you can browbeat me into a
half-assed guilty confession, detective...

41:59.013 --> 42:00.969
...you are sadly mistaken.

42:01.133 --> 42:04.808
I don't kid myself, Mr. Rudman. I got all
the confession I'm gonna get on this...

42:04.973 --> 42:07.771
...from Sandquist.
- Then we have nothing left to discuss.

42:07.933 --> 42:12.370
Except what if he changes his mind?
Then what?

42:12.533 --> 42:15.001
What if he stops being angry
long enough to realize...

42:15.173 --> 42:17.733
...that he got screwed twice?

42:17.893 --> 42:20.612
First by Putnam and then by you.

42:21.453 --> 42:24.773
And what if he decides that whatever
you paid him wasn't high enough?

42:24.773 --> 42:27.492
And what if he decides that whatever
you paid him wasn't high enough?

42:31.573 --> 42:34.087
The man's a time bomb.

42:34.253 --> 42:37.802
He could blow up right in your face.
You prepared to live with that?

42:37.973 --> 42:40.282
You can't imagine
what I live with, detective.

42:40.453 --> 42:43.092
Maybe you think you got away
with murder once, you will again.

42:43.253 --> 42:45.721
- You're crazy!
- You're the crazy one, Mr. Rudman.

42:45.893 --> 42:50.125
You had one man killed. You sent
another man away to prison for it.

42:50.293 --> 42:52.045
And what have you gained?

42:52.213 --> 42:54.852
Your daughter's still dead.
You're still alone.

42:55.013 --> 42:58.801
And if you haven't figured it out
that vengeance never gets you even...

42:58.973 --> 43:00.725
...you will.

43:02.733 --> 43:05.088
As far as I'm concerned...

43:05.253 --> 43:08.211
...whoever it was
that killed that filthy bastard...

43:08.373 --> 43:10.045
...he's a hero.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.886
You're no hero, Mr. Rudman. No.

43:13.053 --> 43:16.045
How it goes is, you lost your daughter,
you lost your dignity...

43:16.213 --> 43:18.886
...and now you've lost your humanity.
