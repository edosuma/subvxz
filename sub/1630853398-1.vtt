[LIV] Mom, the gala committee is getting
completely bombarded

34:26.983 --> 34:28.902
- with ticket requests.
- [MOM] The guest list's been closed

34:28.985 --> 34:30.235
- for weeks.
- Mom! I'm home.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.947
- [MOM] We're in here, honey.
- Finally.

34:33.031 --> 34:35.283
I had the most incredible day.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.370
Oh, apparently. So incredible that
you completely missed dinner.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.080
And all the gala prep. Hmm.

34:40.163 --> 34:43.083
Yeah, I know, but I was at Dad's drop

34:43.166 --> 34:45.460
and while I was in line,
I actually met this really handsome...

34:45.543 --> 34:47.253
Whoa, whoa. Honey. You were in line?

34:47.337 --> 34:49.630
You could've just called the office
to get yourself a pair.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.841
- No.
- You were researching the Sleeks, right?

34:51.925 --> 34:54.511
I asked Kira to test out the prototype
for the hybrid.

34:54.594 --> 34:55.719
So you wore them out today?

34:55.804 --> 34:56.971
So, what's the word, honey?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.056
- Um...
- I'm telling you,

34:58.139 --> 34:59.891
low-tops are really trending right now.

34:59.974 --> 35:01.518
The Sleeks are perfect.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.853
You get me some solid numbers,
and I'll consider it.

35:03.937 --> 35:05.647
Dad, Sneakercon is
only a couple months away

35:05.730 --> 35:08.441
and we need to dominate if we wanna
get our numbers up from last year.

35:08.525 --> 35:10.860
It's not like the numbers
last year were terrible.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.195
[MOM] No, but it wasn't great.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.738
They were down from the year before,

35:13.822 --> 35:15.365
which was a little down
from the year before that,

35:15.448 --> 35:16.533
so we just need something big.

35:16.616 --> 35:19.244
And that's why I'm telling you,
the Sleeks are what King6 needs.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.453
- Dad?
- Darius?

35:20.537 --> 35:22.247
I know there's a lot
of pressure right now.

35:22.330 --> 35:26.042
This designer is a big deal for us.
He's a proven hit-maker.

35:26.126 --> 35:29.045
I do like that he's launched
these big campaigns. I'll say that.

35:29.129 --> 35:31.131
[LIV] He's had three
of the biggest launches last year.

35:31.214 --> 35:32.298
You gotta trust me, Dad.

35:32.382 --> 35:33.508
Something on your mind, Kira?

35:35.844 --> 35:36.845
Yeah.

35:38.179 --> 35:41.182
I just don't think that the Sleeks
are gonna put us back on top.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.560
[CHUCKLES] Oh? And why not?

35:45.145 --> 35:47.022
They just... They don't say anything.

35:47.105 --> 35:48.857
I mean, there's no story behind them.

35:48.940 --> 35:53.153
They're... They're not bad,
but they're just a little basic.

35:53.236 --> 35:55.363
Oh, you did not just call me basic.

35:55.447 --> 35:57.532
I just... I think that we could do better.

35:57.615 --> 36:01.036
Dad, I mean, we're not exactly tapped
into the street up here.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.412
We need a new voice.

36:02.495 --> 36:04.956
It feels like we need
to find someone fresh.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.793
Okay, I have a pile of research
that says differently.

36:08.877 --> 36:09.878
It's just my opinion.

36:10.503 --> 36:12.839
And shouldn't
my opinion count for something?

36:13.840 --> 36:14.841
It does.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.511
Your mother's right.
Problem is, I learned a long time ago,

36:18.595 --> 36:21.973
you cannot run a business
on your opinions alone.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.642
Talent, passion. It's only part of it.

36:24.726 --> 36:28.063
You see, my team has experience,
and they do all this research

36:28.146 --> 36:31.941
and if all that says the Sleek is what
we need right now to put us back on top,

36:32.025 --> 36:33.193
that's what we doing.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.904
- Dad, come on. Just give me a shot.
- [MOM] Mm-hmm.

36:35.987 --> 36:38.198
[KIRA]
You gave Liv a chance when she asked.

36:38.281 --> 36:42.160
I'm really happy that you wanna be
more involved in the family business,

36:42.243 --> 36:45.038
but a lot of jobs rely on these decisions.

36:45.121 --> 36:48.041
So, you gotta come at me
with something other than,

36:49.459 --> 36:52.045
"They're basic. I'm right."

36:52.128 --> 36:53.713
- You know what I'm saying?
- [MOM] You know what?

36:53.797 --> 36:56.257
Babe, it can't hurt to keep looking.

36:56.341 --> 36:58.051

[SIGHS]

37:05.850 --> 37:08.103

you're gonna find this person,

37:08.186 --> 37:09.270
but I'll let you try.

37:09.354 --> 37:11.272
- Wait, wait. What?
- [DARIUS] So, this is the deal.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.066
- Kira...
- Mm-hmm?

37:13.149 --> 37:16.361
...if you find a designer
that we should consider,

37:16.444 --> 37:22.659
someone that speaks to you, tells a story
and has the experience to back it up,

37:22.742 --> 37:24.285
we'll try it out.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.287
- Really?
- [GRUNTING]

37:26.371 --> 37:28.331
Dad, this means so much to me.

37:28.415 --> 37:31.501
- You did hear me say "and," right?
- Yeah. Yeah, Dad, I did.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.669
All right. Good.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.755
Now, the gala's in two weeks,

37:35.839 --> 37:39.968
and if we haven't found a designer
that changes the game for us by then,

37:40.051 --> 37:42.053
we'll go with your sister's Sleeks.

37:43.471 --> 37:46.349
- Okay. What's next?
- Well, we have the gala charity auction.

and tell them to wait.

- [SAMI] Yep.

since I was seven. It's the King.

her kicks. Her King6 kicks, all right?

Okay, yeah, but what were you gonna do?
Lie to the girl?

39:00.173 --> 39:02.926

okay?

39:09.933 --> 39:11.935

- The King's charity gala?

39:16.564 --> 39:19.109
Yeah. Now you know how to find her again.
You're welcome.

39:19.192 --> 39:20.485
Okay, okay.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.737

of the year?

the definition of fate?

It's not. I-I-It's just not.
It can't, all right?

It's not scientifically possible,
because I am just...

39:59.107 --> 40:00.567

40:00.650 --> 40:01.776

you're a somebody, show off your talent.

- Design some sick kicks for the gala.
- Sami, it's in two weeks.

- There's not enough time for that.
- Best get to work then.

in your beaters, okay?

wanna do that anyway. Look at them.

- You're crazy.
- Think about it.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.192
It's never gonna happen.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.152
Hey, never say never.

40:44.235 --> 40:47.447
You should really consider
the craftsmanship and the material.

40:47.530 --> 40:49.282
It's Italian leather.

40:49.366 --> 40:50.575
- It's very nice.
- Mmm.

40:50.658 --> 40:54.245
[SIGHS] But I think it's a little outside
my price range.

40:54.329 --> 40:56.373
You're on your feet all day
at the restaurant.

40:56.456 --> 40:58.416
Don't your feet deserve a treat, hmm?

40:59.084 --> 41:01.878
- El! There you are.
- Mrs. Singh!

41:02.587 --> 41:03.797
Oh.

41:03.880 --> 41:04.881
Mmm, how you doing?

41:04.964 --> 41:07.008
You know,
I've been meaning to drop these off.

41:07.092 --> 41:09.928
- Okay, what you got for me?
- I wanna make sure you had these

41:10.011 --> 41:12.222
just in case
your allergies acted up this fall.

41:12.305 --> 41:13.556
- Thank you.
- Your mom always swore

41:13.640 --> 41:14.766
- by my home remedies.
- That she did.

41:14.849 --> 41:17.185
- So give them a try, <i>beta</i>, okay?
- Will do.

41:18.269 --> 41:20.188
- Love the window by the way.
- Look, I'll show you.

41:20.271 --> 41:22.023
Aw. You're so sweet.

41:22.107 --> 41:24.526
Aleko let me rescue the clock hands
from the trash so...

41:24.609 --> 41:27.195
Aren't you clever? Rosie would love it.

41:27.278 --> 41:29.698
- You think?
- Think about what I said Mrs. Singh.

41:29.781 --> 41:32.409
I'd be happy to throw in
a free pair of Odor-Eaters.

41:32.492 --> 41:34.786
Did he just tell me my feet stink?

41:34.869 --> 41:36.037
Quite possibly.

41:37.622 --> 41:38.623
Bye, Mrs. Singh.

41:38.707 --> 41:39.708
[MRS. SINGH] Bye!

41:40.375 --> 41:42.002
I don't get this neighborhood.

41:42.085 --> 41:44.004
They all pretend to be one big,
happy family.

41:44.087 --> 41:46.131
But when it comes down to it,
where are they?

41:46.214 --> 41:48.466
- I mean, they don't know you.
- [STEPFATHER] And that's my fault?

41:48.550 --> 41:51.177
Look, I've brought in all kinds
of styles and new items

41:51.261 --> 41:53.096
so everyone will have something
to pick from.

41:53.179 --> 41:54.806

there's a designer out there
who's actually saying something,

01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:28.595
who's got a point of view.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.388
And, El...

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:33.433
you're him.

01:05:33.516 --> 01:05:34.601
W-Wait.

01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:36.853
You're saying I should
design for the King brand?

01:05:36.936 --> 01:05:37.771
Yeah.

01:05:37.854 --> 01:05:39.230
- [APPLAUSE]
- King brand?

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:40.523
- Like...
- Oh.

01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:42.067
Oh, that's him.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.110
- Who?
- Come on. My dad.

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:46.279
- [ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen...
- Come on. Now's our chance.

01:05:46.363 --> 01:05:47.822
- ...basketball legend...
- [EL] Right now?

01:05:47.906 --> 01:05:52.077
...and your host for this evening's King6
Annual Charity Gala, Darius King.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.455
[DARIUS] My wife, Denise, and I
would like to thank you all for coming.

01:05:55.538 --> 01:05:57.791
As a kid growing up
in the streets of Queens,

01:05:57.874 --> 01:05:59.209
I didn't always have the money

01:05:59.292 --> 01:06:02.170
- to buy the freshest pair...
- Okay. Oh, God. I'm so excited.

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:04.422
Once he's done with his intro,
I'll grab him.

01:06:04.506 --> 01:06:05.840
[DARIUS] Who believed in my dream?

01:06:05.924 --> 01:06:08.885
Yo, this is crazy. I mean, he's gonna
lose it when he sees your work.

01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:10.136
Y-Y-You think so?

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.304
[DARIUS] ...to the next level.

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:12.681
And King6 was born.

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:15.975
Under the direction
of my eldest daughter, Liv,

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:19.688
we will be dropping something
unlike anything you've seen before.

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:20.772
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:20.855 --> 01:06:23.692
Working with great talent,
people we believe in.

01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:24.984
As I talk about Liv...

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.445
- Anyway, uh, he will.
- [DARIUS] ...I'm reminded...

01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:30.031
Listen, you know,
it's kind of silly, but my dad,

01:06:30.115 --> 01:06:33.702
he says that experience really matters,

01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:35.745
so he's gonna want
to know everything about you.

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.914
Like where you're from
or what else you've done

01:06:37.997 --> 01:06:39.874
- or who you've worked with.
- Oh.

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:40.959
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:44.337
You're young, but the way you've blown up,
you've obviously had, like...

01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:46.214
- Well... I...
- ...tons of professional gigs, right?

01:06:46.297 --> 01:06:48.299
I got a lot riding on this.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.015
I'm your guy.

01:06:58.935 --> 01:07:00.812
I'm never going to forget tonight.

01:07:00.895 --> 01:07:03.565
- S-Same.
- [CLEARS THROAT] Where have you been?

01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:05.483
Oh, good. You found her.

01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:07.152
- Hey, Sami.
- Hi.

01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:11.281
- [LIV] You know these people?
- This is the guy.

01:07:11.364 --> 01:07:12.532
You're the guy?

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:15.160
Uh, I did design these,
but I'm not really...

01:07:15.243 --> 01:07:17.537
Of course, he's the guy.
I mean, look at the shoes.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.123
Can I take a picture of you?
You look so beautiful.

01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:21.416
Now, you get in there.

01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:23.793
- Oh, stop being so modest.
- [KIRA] Yeah.

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:27.047
He's such a superstar. [SQUEALS]
Look at that power couple.

01:07:27.881 --> 01:07:29.966
[SQUEALS]
That's so cute. I'm gonna frame it.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:30.967
[ALL LAUGH]

01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:33.136
I'm so excited.
I really want Dad to meet him.

01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:35.347
Isn't this exactly who he told me to find?

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:36.431
[LIV] Take a deep breath.

01:07:36.514 --> 01:07:39.059
You'll get a chance to introduce him
to Dad when he's done.

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:40.977
[DARIUS] This program promotes honesty
and integrity,

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:42.520
which are very important...

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:43.855
I wish he'd hurry up.

01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:46.733
It is almost midnight, so you know
he always does the auction then.

01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:48.651
- Midnight?
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:49.903
Midnight.

01:07:49.986 --> 01:07:51.112
[BELL TOLLS]

01:07:51.196 --> 01:07:53.823
[GASPS] Oh, no, we can't go.
You're about to meet King.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:56.659
That's exactly the problem.
I... I screwed up.

01:07:56.743 --> 01:07:58.870
Okay, okay. G did warn us about midnight.

01:07:58.953 --> 01:08:00.914
I'm... I'm sorry. What is going on...

01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:03.208
[ANNOUNCER] Give it up for Darius King.

01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:06.461
He'll be stepping down
so we can start the auction at midnight.

01:08:06.544 --> 01:08:07.504
[EL] I'm so sorry.

01:08:07.587 --> 01:08:09.923
I really gotta get the guy
out of here right now.

01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:11.216
It's... It's a... Uh...

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:12.592
- Wait. What?
- A curfew thing.

01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:13.677
- Follow me.
- [EL] Excuse me.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.220

01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:17.055
- Excuse me.
- [LIV] You can't leave yet.

01:08:17.138 --> 01:08:18.890

- [EL] Hey, Sami.
- [SAMI] Yeah?

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:23.682
[EL] Why did everyone at that party think
I was this hot underground designer?

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.517
One that's blowing up worldwide.

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.815
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.526
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing m-much.

01:10:35.276 --> 01:10:37.529
- Just that you're a designer...
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:39.948
...and you're really cool. And that's...

01:10:40.907 --> 01:10:42.575
That's about it.

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:45.328
Samantha.

01:10:46.246 --> 01:10:49.499
- Okay, I may have hyped you up a little...
- Why?

01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:51.710
...but I barely said anything.

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:54.754
I can't help what conclusions
other people might have jumped to.

01:10:54.838 --> 01:10:57.841
Okay, well, Kira asked me
if I have professional experience.

01:10:59.217 --> 01:11:00.468
- And?
- And...

01:11:00.552 --> 01:11:04.723
She wanted me to meet Mr. King.
So I said... I said I did.

01:11:04.806 --> 01:11:07.350
- Dude, that's amazing!
- No, that's not good.

01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.310
That's horrible. I lied. I lied to her.

01:11:09.394 --> 01:11:12.856
Okay, do you think anyone at that party
was a 100% real?

01:11:12.939 --> 01:11:14.399
- Yes.
- No.

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:19.279
Look, we both exaggerated a teeny
amount, and it's gonna turn out great.

01:11:19.904 --> 01:11:21.197
- [SIGHS]
- Probably.

01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:23.742
[EL] Sami, how can I face her again
after this?

01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:26.494
So tell me again why he ran away.

01:11:26.578 --> 01:11:29.456
- He's an artist. They're all... You know.
- [DARIUS] Mmm.

01:11:29.539 --> 01:11:31.791
I mean, Banksy doesn't ever show his face.

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:34.252
And you're a really big deal, Dad.

01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:36.755
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, people get nervous.

01:11:36.838 --> 01:11:38.923
- Yeah, nice try.
- Okay, but Dad.

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:42.344
Come on, look. Look at the work.
I mean, it speaks for itself, right?

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:44.596
I admit it does draw me in.

01:11:44.679 --> 01:11:49.851
It's like looking at something
entirely new, but so familiar.

01:11:49.934 --> 01:11:53.605
It reminds me of home. I don't know why.
It's very colorful.

01:11:53.688 --> 01:11:55.148
Yo, I know that spot.

01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:58.193
Your mom took me here
when we first started dating.

01:11:58.276 --> 01:12:00.612
- Really?
- Yeah, they had, like, the best dessert.

01:12:00.695 --> 01:12:02.655
- It was like this custardy thing...
- Galaktoboureko?

01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:04.491
Yeah. Hey, how you know that?

01:12:04.574 --> 01:12:05.825
He took me there.

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:10.205
I still don't like that I don't know
anything about his background.

01:12:10.288 --> 01:12:11.289
[SIGHS]

01:12:11.373 --> 01:12:14.959
He's worked with plenty top-tier brands.
Look how personal his work is.

01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.044
I trust him.

01:12:16.878 --> 01:12:19.089
I just really need you to trust me.

01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:20.674
[SIGHS] Liv?

01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:26.054
I admit it's good work, but the unknown
factor just makes it very risky.

01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:30.642
Okay, Kira. You bring him in.

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:35.939
We'll sit him down,
and if everything you say checks out,

01:12:36.022 --> 01:12:38.441
then we'll try to showcase it
at Sneakercon.

01:12:38.525 --> 01:12:40.151
- Really?
- Yes.

01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:42.362
- Thanks, Dad.
- You got it.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:43.655
- Love you, Dad!
- Peace!

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:47.492

then let's really do it.

but I do have his shoe.
