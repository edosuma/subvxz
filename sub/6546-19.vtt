WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.116
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.253 --> 00:05.461
- Your tarot readings are killing people.
Both of your customers died.

00:05.590 --> 00:08.127
- I've never drawn cards for you.
I don't even know you!

00:08.259 --> 00:11.296
I don't remember anyone
asking me to do those readings.

00:11.429 --> 00:13.715
- She lost time.
- You want answers, don't you, Duke?

00:13.848 --> 00:16.260
- Yeah.
- Well, friend, it is your lucky day,

00:16.392 --> 00:19.384
'cause I'm going to tell you.
(Croatoan): Leaving?

00:19.520 --> 00:22.637
- I thought you were dead.
- You turned my aether into something.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.936
- It's too late.
Audrey has it. The aether core.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.559
- I'll get to know her soon enough.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.153
- That'll never happen.
- How's it going with Lainey?

00:31.282 --> 00:34.274
- I don't know how to solve her Trouble.
I thought it was about her estranged husband,

00:34.410 --> 00:37.447
he died, but apparently
Lainey's sister is a medium.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.912
- Audrey...
I thought that Croatoan

00:40.041 --> 00:42.327
killed my husband,
but I was wrong.

00:42.460 --> 00:45.577
My husband became the monster.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.955
He has plans for you.
- No...

00:59.644 --> 01:02.977
- 15 puncture wounds
l've counted so far...

01:03.773 --> 01:05.183
and all made
with a sharp blade.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.192
- Wounds like that,
they're personal.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.107
- She said that Croatoan
is my father.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.735
But why would he kill her?
ljust...

01:16.619 --> 01:18.234
I don't understand any of this.

01:28.506 --> 01:31.794
- I'll be OK. I'm good. It's OK.
- Here.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.512
She was your mother.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.013
I'm here if you need me.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.481
- You should go check on Dwight.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.074
- If you're looking for Conan,
he took off.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.409
- Did he say where?

02:00.538 --> 02:02.870
- No, but if he's as pissed
as I think he is

02:02.999 --> 02:05.741
and he was looking for me,
I would just shoot myself

02:05.876 --> 02:07.457
in the head
and be done with it.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.207
- Don't forget the half dozen

02:14.343 --> 02:16.208
on the beach the day
the Colorado Kid died.

02:16.345 --> 02:20.384
- Counting us, that's 20 people
whose memory

02:20.516 --> 02:23.007
Croatoan altered.
- Yeah, 20 we know about.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.055
Who knows how many more
there could be?

02:25.187 --> 02:27.769
- Or what it is that Croatoan
is making us forget.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.763
- Croatoan.
Need everything now.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.107
- What happened, son?
- He just killed Charlotte.

02:32.236 --> 02:36.070
- What? Why?
- That's what I'm going to find out.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.110
- Sorry, Dwight.
I know how close you two were.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.734
- But what about her research,
the new Barn?

02:42.079 --> 02:43.944
It was going to end
the Troubles for good!

02:44.081 --> 02:46.288
- Forget about the Barn.
We need to put Croatoan down.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.204
- Dwight!
- Audrey!

02:49.337 --> 02:50.702
I'm sorry.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.750
- Let me guess. You're here to stop me
from going off half-cocked?

02:53.883 --> 02:56.625
- Croatoan killed my mother and my son.

02:56.761 --> 03:01.551
We're going to find him together
and you are going to help us.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.389
- Me? How?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.679
- You're going to have another vision.

03:08.356 --> 03:10.893
(theme music playing)

03:41.889 --> 03:45.177
- Who the hell are you?
- That is the wrong question, Duke.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.765
- Says who?

03:48.145 --> 03:52.013
OK, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.764
- You came a long way, Duke.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.104
All the way to North Carolina.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.603
Now that you're here, come on.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.821
What is it you really want to know?

04:01.325 --> 04:04.283
- OK, I'll play along.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.324
I want to know what the hell
is wrong with me.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.581
- There's nothing wrong with you.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.419
You are who you were
always meant to be.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.876
(scoffing): Oh, well...

04:18.008 --> 04:20.340
Thanks, Deepak,
but what exactly is that?

04:20.469 --> 04:22.960
- Crockers are Trouble collectors.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.883
It's been that way
for hundreds of years.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.006
Do you know the story
of Roanoke Island?

04:27.852 --> 04:30.969
- Yeah, it was a European settlement
where everyone disappeared.

04:31.105 --> 04:32.686
- The colonists were cursed.

04:33.149 --> 04:35.014
Troubled.

04:35.151 --> 04:37.312
They came here
to escape persecution,

04:37.445 --> 04:40.232
but so many Troubled people
in the same place

04:40.364 --> 04:42.275
attracted the attention of Croatoan.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.817
- What is a Croatoan?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.570
- Croatoan came to collect
the Troubles from the colonists

04:49.707 --> 04:51.618
but he couldn't.
He wasn't yet strong enough

04:51.750 --> 04:53.251
to escape the Void.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.627
So he turned a young Powhatan man

04:56.755 --> 05:00.543
into the first Crocker,
someone who could collect the Troubles

05:00.676 --> 05:02.337
for him.
- And how exactly did

05:02.470 --> 05:05.257
Great, Great, Great Grandpappy do that?

05:05.389 --> 05:09.132
- By killing every man,
woman and child in the settlement.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.194
(door opening)
(stammering): It's me!

05:22.323 --> 05:25.531
Just me.
- Sorry. Thought you were...

05:25.659 --> 05:30.403
- Well, emotions are running high.
We never seen Dwight so angry.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.530
- Audrey could give him a run
for his money.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.327
How's she doing?

05:35.211 --> 05:38.703
- Seems very focused,
very professional.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.501
- So she's really hurting.
- I believe so.

05:41.634 --> 05:45.593
- I thought my family was messed up.
What are you doing here, anyway?

05:45.721 --> 05:48.383
Audrey and Dwight are trying
to get Dave to have another vision.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.098
I'm not much use there,
but I want to help.

05:51.227 --> 05:54.970
- Charlotte told me
she finally figured it out:

05:55.105 --> 05:58.393
how to build a Barn, end the Troubles
without killing anyone

05:58.526 --> 06:00.517
or taking Audrey away.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.689
- Then she must have left notes.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.107
- I haven't found anything so far.

06:05.241 --> 06:08.699
Still haven't been able to find
Charlotte's go bag, either.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.660
- The roller bag she brought everywhere?
It isn't here?

06:12.748 --> 06:14.409
Do you think Croatoan took it?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.783
- Unless Charlotte had time to hide it.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.328
- So many unanswered questions.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.624
If only we could talk to Charlotte
one last time.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.089
- Maybe we can.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.926
You told me your sister
can talk to the dead.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.429
- Yes. She has a Trouble now, too.

06:38.566 --> 06:41.683
It must have been activated
around the same time mine was.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.935
We've always both been really
into the occult,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.027
so it makes sense
that we both got them.

06:46.156 --> 06:49.694
- And you're sure that it
is a Trouble, not just...

06:49.827 --> 06:50.987
- It's real.

06:52.871 --> 06:57.114
A few days after my husband
Herb was killed in Trouble Alley,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.663
Ona came to me
with a message from him.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.665
We'd been arguing recently

07:03.215 --> 07:06.252
and Herb wanted me to know
that he forgave me for everything,

07:06.385 --> 07:09.001
even the car accident I caused
a few years ago.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.883
Herb almost lost his arm.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.509
I felt so guilty about that.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.470
- Where's your sister now?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.683
Lainey, it's important.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.107
It's about stopping all of this.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.399
Ending the Troubles.
- She's squatting...

07:32.036 --> 07:33.742
at the police station.

07:38.751 --> 07:42.243
- I don't know what's wrong.
(Dwight): Try it again.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.711
- We're just wasting good whisky.

07:45.758 --> 07:50.297
Croatoan must have figured out a way
to stop me from accessing his memories.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.671
- Maybe it's not Croatoan
preventing your visions.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.389
- Huh?
- Then who?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.014
- Please, Audrey.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.609
You don't understand.
I don't just see what's happening,

08:07.738 --> 08:09.023
I feel it, too.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.944
The hatred, the anger.
- You want to see anger?

08:13.077 --> 08:16.319
- Dwight, this isn't the way.
- He's our only lead.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.210
- Dwight's right.

08:25.339 --> 08:29.332
For whatever reason,
you have some kind of link to Croatoan,

08:29.927 --> 08:32.509
to... my father.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.390
- I don't understand
how that monster

08:35.516 --> 08:38.132
could possibly be related to you.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.305
- Well, technically
he's Mara's father, so...

08:42.439 --> 08:45.431
- Yeah...
- Look, Dave, I know that this is hard,

08:46.110 --> 08:48.317
and if there was any other way

08:48.445 --> 08:51.528
I wouldn't be asking you,
but Croatoan has come after all of us

08:51.657 --> 08:54.148
and now Charlotte is dead.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.286
- We need to find him
before anyone else is killed.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.491
- I need you to be strong for me.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.333
- For you.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.790
I'll try.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.380
I'll try to have another vision.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.224
- Oh, spirits, heed our call.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.020
l beseech you to help us commune
with Charlotte Cross.

09:29.153 --> 09:31.735
Only her knowledge
can save Haven.

09:33.991 --> 09:38.576
(gasping)
(shouting in Latin)

09:46.879 --> 09:48.164
I'm sorry.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.379
Your friend, she must have
already crossed over, I...

09:52.217 --> 09:53.593
I can't reach her.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.388
- Well, thanks for trying.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.387
- Yeah, um...
I wish I could have done more.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.059
- It was a Hail Mary.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.398
We'll find another way.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.237
And don't worry, I'm not going
to bust you for squatting here.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.232
- You sure it's alright?
- Yeah. Hopefully, someday soon

10:18.368 --> 10:20.700
Haven will need a police station again.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.904
Until then no loud parties.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.294
- Everything alright, Ona?
- Peachy.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.045
- Hey, I'm Detective Wuornos.
- Herb.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.547
- That's a wicked scar.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.297
(laughing nervously)

10:42.768 --> 10:44.383
- Old car accident.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.435
- Herb.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.775
- He's just a friend.
- No.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.778
He's your sister's husband,

10:56.907 --> 10:58.738
and he's supposed
to be dead.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.779
- No...

11:01.912 --> 11:05.621
- You want I bring Lainey down here?
- OK, fine.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.741
My Trouble...

11:10.003 --> 11:12.164
It doesn't let me talk
to the dead, it...

11:12.673 --> 11:15.164
brings people back
from the dead.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.591
- A resurrection Trouble.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.385
Wait, "people"?
How many have you brought back?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.098
- All of my friends.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.936
Everyone here.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.944
(breathing irregularly)

12:00.512 --> 12:02.673
(Croatoan):
So, you like to watch, Dave?

12:02.806 --> 12:04.171
Take a look at this!

12:05.225 --> 12:08.558
- He spoke to me.
He said my name!

12:08.687 --> 12:10.302
What do you think it means?

12:10.898 --> 12:15.016
Could Croatoan tell when I'm having a vision?
Is he going to come after me next?

12:15.152 --> 12:17.518
- We'll protect you,
I promise.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.690
- You saw aether fragments
in Charlotte's go bag,

12:19.823 --> 12:22.155
that means we can use the
rougarou device to track it down.

12:22.284 --> 12:27.028
- We find Charlotte's go bag
and we find the killer.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.700
- And maybe Charlotte's notes,

12:29.082 --> 12:32.495
although I don't see how we're gonna be
able to build a Barn without Charlotte.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.498
- We may not have to.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.501
We can bring Charlotte back.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.922
- So this Croatoan guy
created the Crockers to collect Troubles.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.217
Why? What did he want with them?

12:50.354 --> 12:52.015
- Same thing he wants now.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.894
- Hold on, 'hell you think
you're going?

12:57.027 --> 12:59.439
We're not done!
- No, we're not.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.438
(rushing and ringing sound)

13:19.299 --> 13:20.254
- What the hell?

13:24.638 --> 13:26.378
I'm in Haven...

13:38.902 --> 13:41.689
- How is this even a question?
We have a way to bring Charlotte back!

13:41.822 --> 13:44.814
- I want my mother back
more than anything,

13:44.950 --> 13:48.943
but by using a Trouble?
- You once used one to bring Nathan back.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.492
- That was a different Trouble.
That was one that we knew how to control.

13:52.624 --> 13:56.116
Ona has had her Trouble for what,
a few days?

13:56.253 --> 13:59.620
She has no idea how it really works,
none of us do.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.668
- Audrey's right. We don't know much
about Ona's Trouble...

14:02.801 --> 14:06.589
- Big surprise. You agree with her.
- But we have to take the risk.

14:10.017 --> 14:13.259
We need Charlotte
to end the Troubles.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.140
(sighing): OK, let's try it.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.029
- I'll get Charlotte,
bring her to the police station.

14:27.993 --> 14:28.948
- Hey...

14:30.120 --> 14:33.954
Herb and the others
Ona resurrected seem fine.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.327
- It just seems
too good to be true.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.456
Here...

14:45.802 --> 14:47.758
I need you to take this.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.844
Dave said that Croatoan was looking

14:49.973 --> 14:53.340
for the aether core.
- You think he knows you have it?

14:53.477 --> 14:55.638
- Just in case, will you take it
and hide it somewhere?

14:55.771 --> 14:57.887
Somewhere where no one else can
find it, not even me.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.725
We can't let Croatoan get hold of it.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.577
(deep breath)

15:14.706 --> 15:16.913
- You found a way to bring her back.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.742
- How did you...
- It's not my first rodeo.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.869
Are you sure about this,
high pockets?

15:22.339 --> 15:24.000
- I've lost so much to the Troubles.

15:24.508 --> 15:25.918
My army career,

15:26.843 --> 15:28.049
my sister...

15:31.181 --> 15:32.341
My daughter.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.342
Can't they finally do some good?

15:39.689 --> 15:41.350
- Well, we're about due.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.063
- I'm not going to let anything else
get taken from me again.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.737
(roaring and whooshing sound)

16:32.284 --> 16:34.240
(gasping)

16:37.914 --> 16:39.779
- Mom?
- Charlotte?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.494
- What... what's going on?

16:44.838 --> 16:47.955
What's this all about?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.127
- You're going to be OK, alright?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.342
We... we brought you back.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.462
- From where?
Why am I at the police station?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.430
- We used a Trouble.

16:58.101 --> 17:01.138
- Uh... We're supposed
to be at the cavern.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.512
We need to purify the aether.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.688
- We already did that.

17:05.817 --> 17:09.275
- We were just about to start.
- What's the last thing you remember?

17:09.613 --> 17:10.602
- Um...

17:13.116 --> 17:15.653
Starting Audrey's training.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.657
Why, what happened? What...

17:20.749 --> 17:22.956
Why do you both keep
looking at me like that?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.166
(Audrey): She doesn't even know
she was killed.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.506
- It takes them some time
to remember everything.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.843
Think about it, she just went through
the most traumatic thing possible.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.587
- How long? She's our only lead
in catching Croatoan.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.464
- You have to be patient.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.559
- We don't have time for patience.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.993
(gasping)

18:03.667 --> 18:05.453
- How long before Herb
remembered his death?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.997
- A couple of days.
It came back in pieces at first.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.458
- OK, I need to talk to him.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.967
- He'll be right back.
He just went to grab some supplies.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.051
Go in. Talk to Charlotte.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.967
- Yeah, remind her who she is,
who she cares about.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.431
Mom?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.348
- Charlotte?

18:42.038 --> 18:44.450
(sighing)

18:52.674 --> 18:53.663
- Vicki?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.544
- I'm working.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.216
- Yeah, I can see that.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.056
- l have to put everything back
the way it was.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.095
It won't work!

19:05.228 --> 19:07.059
It never works!

19:07.981 --> 19:09.562
- Where's Audrey and Nathan?

19:10.025 --> 19:11.356
- Cemetery.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.566
Dead. Like everyone.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.075
- Audrey and Nathan are dead?

19:30.086 --> 19:31.542
OK, who's not dead?

19:32.213 --> 19:33.874
Nobody. Dwight?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.582
Gloria? Dave? Vince?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.427
- I can take you to Vince.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.505
- OK, let's try that.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.777
- Yeah. Charlotte's gone?
How can she be gone?

19:57.906 --> 19:59.988
- She slipped out
while we were talking to Ona.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.407
Should have...
(slamming)

20:04.537 --> 20:08.075
- Did she tell you anything?
About Croatoan, about the Barn?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.823
- No, she couldn’t remember
anything that happened

20:09.959 --> 20:11.915
and Ona said it's
going to take a while.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.502
- She's confused, disoriented.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.873
There ’s got to be some place she’d go.
- I'll start at her lab.

20:18.009 --> 20:18.998
We'll find her, Dwight.

20:19.135 --> 20:23.299
- We'd better, before Croatoan
gets to repeat history.

20:28.228 --> 20:31.186
- Is he going to be OK?
- He's taking it hard.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.929
He's blaming himself.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.931
- And you?
- Me?

20:35.068 --> 20:38.526
My recently resurrected
interdimensional mother

20:38.655 --> 20:41.146
has partial amnesia and ran away.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.026
I'm fine.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.115
Have you been able
to hide the core?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.032
- Yeah. Want me to swing by,
pick you up?

20:48.164 --> 20:51.372
- No, I need to talk to Lainey.
Maybe her tarot cards can help us.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.913
- Isn't that what got us
into this in the first place?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.707
- Yeah, so maybe they can get us out.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.922
(hanging up)

21:11.020 --> 21:13.887
- Oh, is there a new
vampire Trouble?

21:14.023 --> 21:16.765
- You never know
what'll come in handy out there.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.233
- Oh, well what are you
doing with this?

21:19.362 --> 21:23.196
- lt'll track the vial of aether
in Charlotte's go bag.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.404
I find that, I'm one step closer
to finding Croatoan.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.744
- You're going after Croatoan?

21:29.873 --> 21:32.956
I think maybe you should wait
for your buzz to fade.

21:33.084 --> 21:36.918
- Or maybe liquid courage
was exactly what I needed.

21:37.046 --> 21:40.334
Talking to Audrey, I realized

21:40.467 --> 21:42.332
I can't keep hiding
from this, Vincent.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.334
| see what Croatoan's doing

21:44.471 --> 21:46.427
and he knows I'm watching,

21:46.556 --> 21:49.593
and it's only a matter of time
before he comes after me.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.012
- So you go to him first.

21:52.145 --> 21:55.103
That's your plan?
It's a terrible plan!

21:55.231 --> 21:58.519
- Is it? At least
I'll see my death coming,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.516
instead of waiting for it,

22:00.653 --> 22:03.486
cowering like a child
in the corner!

22:08.411 --> 22:10.743
l have to do this, Vince.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.156
- Then I'm coming with you.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.716
- Lainey?

22:33.728 --> 22:35.389
Hey, is there anybody here?

22:36.064 --> 22:38.271
(squelching and chewing noise)

22:45.448 --> 22:47.404
Hey!

22:47.534 --> 22:49.991
(grunting)

22:50.119 --> 22:52.610
Hands up.

22:52.747 --> 22:55.454
(spitting)
(grunting)

22:55.583 --> 22:57.960
Herb...

22:58.086 --> 23:00.873
Oh, my God!

23:01.422 --> 23:03.003
Put your hands over your head.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.752
Get up. Slowly.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.968
(grunting and slobbering)

23:20.567 --> 23:22.353
Get back! Back!

23:22.485 --> 23:24.976
(both grunting)

23:28.241 --> 23:31.483
(Herb growling)
(banging on door)

23:32.912 --> 23:34.152
OK...
(dialling)

23:35.957 --> 23:38.323
Nathan? Hey.
(growling and banging continue)

23:38.459 --> 23:42.122
Those people that Ona brought back,
they're turning into monsters.

23:42.672 --> 23:46.130
We need to find Charlotte and we need
to find her fast before she turns too.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.844
- No, this is crazy.
Herb is fine!

23:54.976 --> 23:57.012
- Herb is not fine anymore.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.598
He was eating Lainey.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.310
How many days has it been
since you brought Herb back from the dead?

24:03.443 --> 24:04.523
- Two days.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.692
He... He was the first.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.613
- You must have
cared about him a lot.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.031
- I know he was married
to Lainey, but...

24:14.037 --> 24:17.996
I loved him,
and he loved me.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.165
But then the Troubles came,

24:22.337 --> 24:23.702
and when he died...

24:24.672 --> 24:25.878
itjust hurt so bad.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.714
- That must have activated
your Trouble.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.586
- And now because of me,
my sister's dead and Herb's become...

24:32.722 --> 24:35.509
- I'm so sorry.
- Maybe there's a way we can change him back?

24:35.642 --> 24:38.475
And then we can stop the others
from becoming like him.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.891
- Where... where are the others?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.223
- They left to see their families.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.776
- I'm going to need those addresses.

24:48.905 --> 24:51.021
- I thought I was doing the right thing,
bringing them back.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.818
- Now, please.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.201
- I found a reference to Ona's Trouble
in Duke's journal.

24:57.705 --> 25:00.617
A Crocker was asking a resurrected woman
about her death,

25:00.750 --> 25:04.959
next thing he knew he was fighting
some kind of undead creature.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.454
- So it looks like she turned
after she remembered how she died.

25:07.590 --> 25:08.921
- If that's true...

25:09.050 --> 25:11.632
- That means asking Charlotte
all those questions about her death...

25:11.761 --> 25:13.968
- ls going to make her transform.
And according to the journal...

25:14.097 --> 25:16.179
- They come after people
they were closest to,

25:16.307 --> 25:20.095
people who remind them the most
of the life that they have lost.

25:22.605 --> 25:23.936
- lf Charlotte turns,

25:24.774 --> 25:26.856
she's coming after you and Dwight.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.316
He has no idea
what kind of danger he's in.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.958
- I knew you'd come here.

25:43.292 --> 25:44.543
This is our spot.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.828
Where you first shot me.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.670
- I regret that.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.176
Pretending to be a CDC agent,

26:00.017 --> 26:02.679
lying about why I was here and...

26:02.812 --> 26:04.894
shooting you.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.816
- Good intentions...

26:08.651 --> 26:09.811
Bad aim.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.229
- Ha!

26:13.531 --> 26:15.863
You took a bullet for your town.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.825
- You do what you can
for the people you love.

26:20.872 --> 26:23.033
I'm sorry I have to ask, but...

26:23.166 --> 26:25.202
do you know what happened?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.005
— They died.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.378
- I should have been there.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.591
- No.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.220
No, you...

26:40.850 --> 26:42.841
you would have just died too.

26:43.686 --> 26:44.926
- Do you remember
what happened?

26:48.900 --> 26:50.515
- I don't know, it's...

26:50.860 --> 26:53.442
it's all so fuzzy,
it's like I'm...

26:55.531 --> 26:57.613
trying to see underwater.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.366
- It was Croatoan.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.991
You told Audrey
that he's her father.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.206
- No, that...
that would mean that...

27:09.629 --> 27:12.962
I must have been confused.
- You have to try, Charlotte.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.289
Try and remember.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.511
- Aha!
(deVIce beeping)

27:20.640 --> 27:24.974
We've got the breadcrumbs,
they should lead us

27:25.102 --> 27:26.933
right to Charlotte's go bag.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.600
- And her killer.
- Cold feet?

27:29.732 --> 27:31.518
What happened
to the liquid courage?

27:31.651 --> 27:33.187
- I should have brought some with.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.435
- Go back, Dave. Let me do this.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.948
- This is my fight,
more than anyone's.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.904
Besides, when we do find him,

27:42.829 --> 27:45.286
can't let you hog the spotlight.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.995
- Perish the thought.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.499
All right. Together then,

27:51.003 --> 27:52.664
until the end of all things.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.087
Hmm?

28:02.849 --> 28:03.964
- Vince?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.425
Is that you, youngster?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.770
- Duke Crocker?

28:11.274 --> 28:15.358
Oh...
- You know, I guess ljust got homesick.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.984
- Not much of a home
to return to, I'm afraid.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.659
Croatoan won.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.038
- OK, seriously, can somebody
please just tell me who that is?

28:33.170 --> 28:34.455
- It doesn't matter,

28:35.131 --> 28:36.462
nothing does.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.173
The game was played and lost.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.420
Lost when Nathan went into the Void

28:43.556 --> 28:44.841
and never came out.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.640
And nothing's been the same since.

28:48.102 --> 28:51.014
- Vince, I need you to tell me
everything that happened

28:51.147 --> 28:53.012
after I left Haven.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.105
Why did Nathan
go into the Void?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.395
(man screaming)

28:58.571 --> 28:59.902
- It's too late,

29:00.698 --> 29:02.859
Croatoan's here.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.691
- So what the hell
are we gonna do?

29:05.828 --> 29:07.819
- The only thing we can do...

29:09.498 --> 29:10.487
die.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.161
- Oh, screw that.

29:21.052 --> 29:22.383
- | asked her to remember,

29:22.762 --> 29:24.252
begged her.
- You didn't know.

29:24.388 --> 29:28.051
- But now she's gonna change because of me.
- No, you did the right thing.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.061
Charlotte is gonna change
no matter what.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.179
But it's all for nothing
if she doesn't tell us about Croatoan

29:34.315 --> 29:35.646
and how to build a new Barn.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.356
- You want to make her
remember even though--

29:37.485 --> 29:40.522
- It's gonna happen, Dwight,
we can't stop it.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.520
Please, let her
save the rest of us.

29:42.657 --> 29:45.694
- You'd never give up on Audrey,
I'm supposed to give up on Charlotte?

29:46.494 --> 29:48.075
(banging on door)
(Audrey): Guys!

29:48.204 --> 29:50.536
(undead moaning and growling)

29:52.708 --> 29:55.290
Guys? Can we get some help, please?

29:55.419 --> 29:57.705
(undead moaning and growling)

30:02.218 --> 30:04.459
(undead moaning and growling)

30:07.890 --> 30:09.881
(grunting)

30:10.017 --> 30:12.759
- Well, that was handy.
- OK...

30:12.895 --> 30:15.307
- Doors boarded up, should give us
a minute to figure this out.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.054
(glass breaking)

30:17.191 --> 30:19.102
- Or not.
- Keep your hands on the door,

30:19.235 --> 30:21.601
l'll cover the windows.
- Done.

30:32.957 --> 30:34.993
- I don't understand!
Why do they want me?!

30:35.126 --> 30:37.162
- They're coming for the people
they're closest to.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.625
- Ah!

30:38.754 --> 30:40.961
- I only wanted to help.
- Oh, you did.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.332
You let them say goodbye.
You gave their loved ones peace of mind.

30:44.468 --> 30:46.004
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.130
- Dwight, l have to try
and get through to Ona.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.800
- No, Audrey. You talk to Ona,
Charlotte disappears,

30:53.936 --> 30:56.973
and your mother dies again.
- There's no other way to stop this.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.971
- I lost you once today,
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.064
I'd rather take my chances
with the undead.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.777
- Dwight's right. Until we figure out how
to build a Barn, Charlotte's going nowhere.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.896
- What about me?
Don't I get a vote?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.490
- Charlotte, you're confused.
- No, I'm not.

31:09.618 --> 31:13.406
I finally remember everything,
my death and my life,

31:13.539 --> 31:16.155
I would never let people get hurt,

31:16.292 --> 31:19.830
so that I could live.
- I'm sorry.

31:19.962 --> 31:23.329
- Don't be. Help Ona.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.841
(undead growling and grunting)

31:31.223 --> 31:32.929
So you want to build a Barn?

31:47.656 --> 31:48.907
- Seth?

32:11.180 --> 32:12.841
Nothing here.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.561
I'm still dreaming.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.192
-You...

32:35.079 --> 32:36.865
are the fulcrum, Duke.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.957
You'll either save your friends

32:39.458 --> 32:40.789
or kill them all.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.670
- You OK? You were mumbling
in your sleep.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.256
- l was?
- Yeah. Sounded like

32:49.385 --> 32:51.842
a bad nightmare, or something.
Frankly, I suspect

32:51.971 --> 32:55.134
it was the tacos, but...
- | wish it was.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.759
The stranger showed me something.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.432
- I'm sorry, the who?
- The guy who was just here.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.432
- Dude, I've been right here

33:06.569 --> 33:08.355
the whole time.
There's nobody here.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.358
- Ona, you have to let her go.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.280
The journal says
it's the only way.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.278
- But that means
Herb goes back to being dead.

33:19.415 --> 33:23.624
- I know it's hard, but you have
to accept that he's gone.

33:23.752 --> 33:27.665
- But there has to be a way to fix him,
just to turn him back to normal.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.255
- Ona, I'm sorry,
there isn't another way.

33:30.926 --> 33:34.418
Your Trouble changed him
and now there is no going back.

33:43.355 --> 33:47.348
- Ona, please.
- I'm trying,

33:47.484 --> 33:51.648
but I can't stop thinking about Herb
and how I'll never see him again.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.320
- That's fine.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.444
It's good to have memories,

33:57.620 --> 33:59.656
but that's what he has
to be right now,

34:00.372 --> 34:03.034
a memory.
- You don't understand.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.333
He is the only person I have left.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.703
- I didn't have anyone
when | first came here.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.872
My husband died,
I lost my daughter...

34:12.009 --> 34:14.341
And I was sure I'd never
find her again, but...

34:15.804 --> 34:18.841
I did.
And I hate the fact that...

34:19.808 --> 34:22.299
I'll never see her again after this, but...

34:24.313 --> 34:26.895
that hate,
it doesn't outweigh

34:27.358 --> 34:29.974
the love I gained
in getting to know her.

34:32.488 --> 34:34.570
And that, I'll take with me.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.366
(undead moaning and growling)

34:39.495 --> 34:41.076
- Running out of time, ladies!

34:58.097 --> 35:00.304
They're dropping in the order
Ona brought them back.

35:03.519 --> 35:06.101
- Then Charlotte only has
a few minutes left.

35:20.494 --> 35:23.281
- If this is really goodbye...

35:25.499 --> 35:27.785
I need to tell you
about your father.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.802
- She wants to see you.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.155
- Come here.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.664
It's never fair, is it?

36:09.001 --> 36:10.081
- No, it isn't.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.164
- What did Charlotte
tell you about the Barn?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.546
- She said the next piece we need
is in the Void.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.631
She called it the controller crystal.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.384
As long as this Shroud's up,

36:22.181 --> 36:24.297
there's no way
to get a thinny open.

36:24.433 --> 36:27.516
And without a thinny,
there's no way to get into the Void.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.605
- There's something else
I need to tell you.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.976
Before I came here,
I wasn't the best person.

36:38.072 --> 36:39.858
(whispering): It's OK.
- No.

36:42.076 --> 36:44.032
But then I fell for you...

36:45.162 --> 36:47.198
and this stupid town, and...

36:47.664 --> 36:48.915
you changed me, Dwight.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.241
And if there was
a thinny open right now,

36:52.753 --> 36:53.868
I wouldn't go...

36:55.381 --> 36:56.837
because here...

36:58.509 --> 37:00.295
with you, it's...

37:01.637 --> 37:03.673
the happiest I've been

37:04.640 --> 37:06.551
in a very long time.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.400
I love you, Dwight.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.030
Goodbye, Dwight.

38:22.676 --> 38:25.668
- She really did love you.
- And you.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.010
Before she passed,

38:31.685 --> 38:33.186
Charlotte told me
what happened...

38:35.689 --> 38:36.974
How she died.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.067
- Maybe we should check out Roanoke.

38:42.196 --> 38:44.528
Maybe that's what your spirit
guide was trying to tell you.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.362
- For the last time...

38:47.951 --> 38:49.282
wasn't my spirit guide.

38:49.411 --> 38:51.868
- So what was he then?
(Duke sighs.)

38:52.831 --> 38:54.571
Alright. You relax,

38:54.708 --> 38:57.666
I'm gonna get some snacks.
Stay right here,

38:57.794 --> 39:00.046
unless you want to reboot
my memory again.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.886
So I got you some of these,
because who doesn't like

39:13.018 --> 39:14.724
tubes of processed mystery meat?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.468
Duke?
(Duke whistles)

39:20.817 --> 39:23.194
What are you doing?
Did you steal that car?

39:23.320 --> 39:24.480
Why are you stealing that car?

39:25.280 --> 39:28.363
- 'Cause I'm going back...
to Haven.

39:28.909 --> 39:32.777
- And the van doesn't go
in that direction because...?

39:33.163 --> 39:34.403
- Because I'm going alone.

39:35.916 --> 39:37.702
- Oh, come on, man.

39:39.461 --> 39:41.122
You know, I could just
follow you there.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.919
Except the second
that you drive away...

39:46.051 --> 39:47.632
- You forget all about me...

39:48.887 --> 39:51.003
and the Troubles and Haven,

39:51.139 --> 39:53.095
and you live a full
and happy life, Seth.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.720
- Come on, Duke,
don't do this.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.265
Duke. Duke...
(car starting)

40:04.903 --> 40:06.279
OK.

40:35.225 --> 40:37.682
- I can't believe he's been
this close for so long.

40:38.186 --> 40:41.019
That's why I tell you it's so important
to keep the door locked!

40:41.732 --> 40:45.350
(device beeping regularly)

40:45.485 --> 40:47.066
- We're getting close.

40:47.988 --> 40:51.196
(device beeping faster)

40:51.325 --> 40:53.316
- Oh, my!
(device beeping quickly)

40:54.328 --> 40:56.114
How could this be?

40:56.580 --> 40:58.411
- Croatoan must be inside.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.073
I told you
he was gonna come after me!

41:01.418 --> 41:04.785
Look, look...
We have to go for backup.

41:11.053 --> 41:12.293
- Come on, Dave.

41:12.429 --> 41:14.920
- Don't be crazy.
- Come on!

41:15.349 --> 41:17.931
(device beeping quickly)

41:23.357 --> 41:25.348
- Why aren't we waiting
for reinforcements?

41:25.484 --> 41:28.100
(device beeping very quickly)

41:34.076 --> 41:35.111
What?

41:35.243 --> 41:37.279
(Vince shuts off the beeping.)
How?

41:37.412 --> 41:41.826
- lf Croatoan took her bag,
why did he put it here?

41:41.958 --> 41:45.166
- Because Croatoan
didn't take the bag...

41:45.295 --> 41:47.035
Dave did.

41:48.924 --> 41:51.757
Dave killed Charlotte.

42:19.079 --> 42:21.912
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
