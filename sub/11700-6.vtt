- (Elevator dings)
- I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!

00:11.035 --> 00:12.936
Not funny, boys!

00:13.938 --> 00:15.939
It is from this side.

00:15.973 --> 00:19.609
Think this is the first time I
woke up in an elevator landing?

00:19.643 --> 00:20.844
It's called the '90s!

00:22.546 --> 00:24.647
Mom, I'm sorry. It's been fun.

00:24.682 --> 00:26.549
- We've had some good times.
- Have we?

00:28.319 --> 00:30.320
Listen, Mrs. Wheeler,
you have got to move out.

00:30.354 --> 00:31.988
Go. You're finished.

00:32.022 --> 00:33.223
<i>Finito </i>! Buh-bye.

00:34.191 --> 00:36.860
Trust me,
I would be out of here in two seconds

00:36.894 --> 00:38.762
if I could just get rid of my subletter.

00:38.796 --> 00:41.131
Wait, wait. Seriously? That's it?

00:41.165 --> 00:42.732
We'll get rid of 'em. We're experts.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.834
Yeah. Please notice the couch
in front of the elevator.

00:46.637 --> 00:48.538
Great. Just grab my stuff.

00:48.572 --> 00:50.640
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- Go to grandma. There you go.

00:50.674 --> 00:54.444
See how wonderful it is when we
just work together as a family?

00:56.480 --> 00:57.614
(Lock clicks)

00:59.216 --> 01:01.184
And this is the part where I call the police

01:01.218 --> 01:03.419
and tell them I spotted two
kids trying to steal my couch.

01:03.454 --> 01:06.322
- Yeah.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.402
Okay, so I have looked over this lease,

01:19.470 --> 01:21.471
and I know exactly what we need to do.

01:22.506 --> 01:24.307
Find someone who can read a lease.

01:24.341 --> 01:27.277
(Scoffs) Well, don't look at me.

01:27.311 --> 01:29.245
That was the part of the real estate test

01:29.280 --> 01:30.513
where I just answered all "C's."

01:32.316 --> 01:33.550
- Hi.
- Hey, babe. Perfect timing.

01:33.584 --> 01:35.185
Can you look at this lease

01:35.219 --> 01:37.587
and find some sort of magic
legal words that can end it?

01:37.621 --> 01:40.490
First of all,
I am way too busy at work to get involved.

01:40.524 --> 01:42.292
And second, I hate to break it to you,

01:42.326 --> 01:44.460
but the law tends to favor
the person holding the lease.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.496
(Scoffs) God, you lawyers ruin everything

01:46.530 --> 01:48.631
with your rules, and your laws,

01:48.666 --> 01:50.600
and your penal codes.

01:51.635 --> 01:54.170
I just really wanted to say "penal codes."

01:55.439 --> 01:57.574
Wait, what if the guy didn't have the lease?

01:57.608 --> 02:00.143
Like, what if someone loses it for him?

02:01.178 --> 02:02.445
So what you're saying is

02:02.479 --> 02:05.315
we should lure him out of my apartment

02:05.349 --> 02:07.317
and then steal his lease?

02:07.351 --> 02:08.550
Mom, that's...

02:09.620 --> 02:11.354
Totally brilliant!

02:11.388 --> 02:12.555
Hey, that was my idea.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.557
Tucker, we're all on the same team.

02:14.592 --> 02:18.161
Trying to move forward. My idea.

02:18.195 --> 02:21.164
Oh my God,
you're not gonna believe what happened.

02:21.198 --> 02:23.399
I just got offered a role
on <i> general hospital.</i>

02:23.434 --> 02:25.335
- (Gasps)
- Oh my God, Danny! Really?

02:25.369 --> 02:29.138
- Yeah.
- That's amazing! <i>G.H. </i> Is my all-time favorite show.

02:29.173 --> 02:31.441
That's what real fans call it.

02:31.475 --> 02:34.444
Wow. Professional hockey player

02:34.478 --> 02:38.014
and now a famous actor. Oh.

02:39.183 --> 02:41.084
You're doing real good too, Benji.

02:42.786 --> 02:44.821
Well, apparently I'm perfect for the role.

02:44.855 --> 02:47.724
I play a professional hockey
player named Danny Wheeler.

02:47.758 --> 02:50.693
Wow. How many other guys did you beat out?

02:52.630 --> 02:54.397
Hey,
do you think you could help me with my line?

02:54.431 --> 02:55.698
It's "Hi, I'm Danny Wheeler."

02:55.733 --> 02:57.533
Look, I already memorized it!

02:57.568 --> 02:59.269
I'm a natural!

02:59.303 --> 03:01.471
Maybe, but you know, just in case,

03:01.505 --> 03:03.373
I should probably still
go to the set with you...

03:03.407 --> 03:06.376
moral support, dialogue coaching,

03:06.410 --> 03:08.278
light entouraging.

03:08.312 --> 03:11.014
Thanks.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

03:11.048 --> 03:13.983
Oh, that's so sweet.
All right, I'd better get back to work.

03:14.018 --> 03:16.753
Wait, wait, wait. So this will be

03:16.787 --> 03:18.788
one of those priorities you
were just talking about?

03:18.822 --> 03:20.957
Oh, let's see. Fulfilling a lifelong fantasy

03:20.991 --> 03:22.892
of meeting the cast of my favorite show.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.628
Participating in a
borderline illegal eviction.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.597
Oh yeah,
I think I got that in the right order.

03:27.631 --> 03:30.400
I was actually talking about the Ben,
your boyfriend,

03:30.434 --> 03:32.235
versus Danny, your whatever.

03:32.269 --> 03:34.537
Oh. Well, if you don't want me to go,
just say so.

03:34.571 --> 03:37.307
- Really?
- No, because it's not 1950,

03:37.341 --> 03:39.275
and I'm not a housewife
who needs your permission.

03:39.310 --> 03:42.178
♪ I'm going to port Charles ♪

03:47.918 --> 03:49.185

03:49.219 --> 03:51.654
Oh, Zane!

03:51.689 --> 03:53.623
I am so sorry.

03:53.657 --> 03:56.426
I really thought I knew
how to pack a parachute.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.363
- (Sobbing)
- And cut. Perfect.

04:00.397 --> 04:02.198
You're a genius.
Okay, let's get ready to shoot this.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.234
Hi. I'm Kelly.

04:05.269 --> 04:07.437
- You must be...
- I'm Riley. Riley Perrin.

04:07.471 --> 04:10.239
I... I can't believe I am meeting you.
You are just...

04:10.274 --> 04:12.108
Oh, you're so adorable.

04:12.142 --> 04:13.343
- (Both laugh)
- I know.

04:15.045 --> 04:16.879
Hi, I'm, uh...

04:16.914 --> 04:18.947
- I'm...
- Danny Wheeler.

04:18.983 --> 04:21.050
Danny Wheeler.
I'll do it better when I'm on camera.

04:21.084 --> 04:22.952
Mmm. Promise?

04:24.688 --> 04:26.956
(Angrily) Can we hire a
professional actor just once?

04:28.792 --> 04:32.428
Oh my God, <i>soap opera digest </i> was right.

04:32.463 --> 04:35.365
She is so much nicer in person.

04:37.368 --> 04:38.401
(Knocks on door)

04:38.435 --> 04:41.204
Okay, mom, I think your tenant is here.

04:43.273 --> 04:45.308
You're here! Joshua is here.

04:45.342 --> 04:47.043
I repeat, Josh is here!

04:48.145 --> 04:49.812
Yes, he is!

04:51.882 --> 04:53.716
He's in. I can't believe

04:53.751 --> 04:54.984
it was so easy to get him into our place.

04:55.019 --> 04:56.953
Yeah, well,
it doesn't hurt that Joshua's gay

04:56.987 --> 04:59.889
- and Ben's a looker.
- You told him your son's gay?

04:59.923 --> 05:01.657
Of course not.

05:01.692 --> 05:03.326
I heavily implied it.

05:04.528 --> 05:06.262
Ben: Hey, man,
just make yourself comfortable.

05:07.297 --> 05:08.498
Joshua and I are just having a beer,

05:08.532 --> 05:10.333
so it shouldn't take too long.

05:12.503 --> 05:16.105
I have a kid.
I read that it's important to talk to them...

05:16.140 --> 05:17.206
it... her. I have a kid.

05:18.275 --> 05:20.877
Really? How did that happen?

05:20.911 --> 05:23.713
Oh, you know, crazy party, too much liquor.

05:23.747 --> 05:25.014
Girl who wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

05:26.016 --> 05:28.718
I tried that once. Not really a fan.

05:30.554 --> 05:31.587
But I do love kids.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.389
Really?
'Cause most dudes don't wanna hang out

05:33.424 --> 05:34.357
with a guy who has a kid.

05:35.526 --> 05:37.260
I'm not most dudes.

05:39.263 --> 05:41.364
- Beer?
- My kind of guy!

05:45.335 --> 05:48.204
Okay, just remember: You got this. Why?

05:48.238 --> 05:50.073
- Because I'm Danny Wheeler.
- Yeah, you are!

05:50.107 --> 05:51.941
- And what's your line?
- "I'm Danny Wheeler."

05:51.975 --> 05:53.042
Yeah, it is.

05:54.078 --> 05:55.812
Hey, we're thrilled to have you here, David.

05:55.846 --> 05:57.914
- It's Danny.
- Yeah, okay, whatever. Let's talk about the scene.

05:57.948 --> 06:00.450
So Samantha, played by Kelly,

06:00.484 --> 06:01.551
is dating Zane, who's in a coma.

06:01.585 --> 06:02.819
She thinks maybe there's
a way to get him out of it

06:02.853 --> 06:05.321
by introducing him to his
favorite hockey player.

06:05.355 --> 06:07.423
So you, the big guy,
you come in through this door,

06:07.458 --> 06:09.192
you say your line, you shake her hand,

06:09.226 --> 06:10.226
and you hold for camera.

06:10.260 --> 06:12.328
Hold her hand or hold the camera?

06:12.362 --> 06:13.463
Really?

06:15.265 --> 06:17.266
If Wheeler doesn't get this in three takes,

06:17.301 --> 06:18.190
we're using my stand-in.

06:18.215 --> 06:20.303
All right, let's go. Let's
go from the top, please.

06:20.337 --> 06:22.105
All right. David, you go outside the door,

06:22.139 --> 06:24.040
- it's Danny.
- Nobody cares. Here we go.

06:27.111 --> 06:29.679
And... action.

06:29.713 --> 06:31.547
Oh, Zane.

06:32.549 --> 06:33.749
Please wake up.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.718
I don't think I can live without you.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.788
Please!

06:38.822 --> 06:40.490
(Door rattles)

06:47.164 --> 06:48.397
I'm sorry.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.900
I'm Samantha.

06:51.902 --> 06:54.036
Hi. I'm Danny Wheeler.

06:56.907 --> 06:59.075
Director: And cut! Genius!
Let's move on, gang!

06:59.109 --> 07:01.744
Oh, Danny Wheeler. You surprised me.

07:01.778 --> 07:03.546
(Giggles) Oh, thank you.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.816
We... we worked on it a bunch.

07:06.850 --> 07:09.519
I'm kind of his coach.

07:09.553 --> 07:11.621
I'm kind of not sure why
you're talking to me.

07:13.257 --> 07:15.591
You know, I could use a new love interest.

07:15.626 --> 07:18.194
- Well, what about Zane?
- You mean Pete?

07:18.228 --> 07:19.395
I'll just have the writers kill him off.

07:21.031 --> 07:22.365
If this works out, you can dump your coach

07:22.399 --> 07:23.933
and we can rehearse at my place.

07:24.935 --> 07:27.770
Pete,
you need to get your things out of my place.

07:29.206 --> 07:30.873
Tucker: <i> I can't find the lease anywhere.</i>

07:31.875 --> 07:33.709
- Ben: <i> Hello?</i>
- Ben, it's me,

07:33.744 --> 07:35.711
but call me Vivian and ask me what I want.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.548
Hello, Vivian. What do you want?

07:38.582 --> 07:40.550
(Whispers) It's Vivian.

07:41.552 --> 07:43.386
I need you to find out
where he keeps his lease.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.620
We've searched everywhere.

07:44.655 --> 07:48.157
Oh, also, ask him what those
pills in the blue bottle were.

07:48.192 --> 07:49.325
I feel a little weird.

07:50.327 --> 07:51.961
God, I hate Vivian!

07:51.995 --> 07:54.163
She's... my cleaning lady.

07:54.198 --> 07:55.998
Yeah, she likes to go through everything,

07:56.033 --> 07:58.000
I gotta start hiding my important documents.

07:59.169 --> 08:00.970
Hey, where do you hide yours?

08:02.039 --> 08:03.873
I'm so bad about that.

08:03.907 --> 08:06.909
They're all just shoved
in a drawer somewhere.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.678
Really? A drawer?

08:09.680 --> 08:11.547
Did you hear that? A drawer.

08:13.684 --> 08:15.618
"Drawer" is Emma's word of the day.

08:18.121 --> 08:19.255
You seem kind of preoccupied.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.259
- Maybe I should head home.
- Home? Now? No, no, aren't you comfortable here?

08:24.394 --> 08:26.028
Well, I could get more comfortable.

08:27.197 --> 08:29.765
Yes, yes, please,
get as comfortable as you like.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.000
<i>Mi casa es su cas...</i>

08:33.770 --> 08:35.905
Riley! What's up?

08:38.609 --> 08:39.808
This is our new neighbor, Joshua.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.544
Uh, he didn't know any guys in the city.

08:44.581 --> 08:46.282
Well, he certainly does now.

08:50.481 --> 08:51.900
That was close.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.901
We got so caught up in your love story,

08:53.935 --> 08:55.869
we almost ran right into your boyfriend.

08:55.904 --> 08:58.138
It's bad enough I'm stuck living here,

08:58.173 --> 09:01.075
but now I have to compete
with my own son for men.

09:02.877 --> 09:05.712
Look!
I've got tomorrow's script and schedule,

09:05.747 --> 09:07.681
and I've got real lines!

09:07.715 --> 09:08.715
Oh.

09:08.783 --> 09:10.851
It's a funeral scene for
Samantha's boyfriend.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.686
Oh, that's sad.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.555
Then we start making out over the casket.

09:14.589 --> 09:15.689
Oh, that's hot.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.591
You guys are gonna come, right?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.360
- Riley, will you help me rehearse again?
- Oh yeah, sure.

09:20.395 --> 09:23.330
Wait, hold on. The kiss?
You're gonna rehearse the kiss?

09:23.364 --> 09:25.399
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.968
Kissing guys is kinda your department.
You should do it.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.104
- (Laughter)
- That's hilarious.

09:30.138 --> 09:31.939
Oh man, that's so funny.

09:31.973 --> 09:33.173
Now if you'll excuse me,

09:33.208 --> 09:34.808
I'm gonna go put my child to bed.

09:34.843 --> 09:36.877
You know, the one I made with a woman.

09:36.911 --> 09:38.745
Both: Oh.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.515
Okay, you ready?

09:41.549 --> 09:43.517
(Clears throat, sighs)

09:43.551 --> 09:45.853
"I thought my heart would be broken forever,

09:45.887 --> 09:48.655
"but now that you're here, I'm healed.

09:48.690 --> 09:51.258
"You're a heart healer, Danny Wheeler."

09:52.260 --> 09:53.460
"It's because I...

09:53.495 --> 09:55.162
"I love you, Samantha."

09:56.297 --> 09:57.464
"I love you too, Danny."

10:01.102 --> 10:03.036
And we'll just skip the passionate kiss.

10:03.071 --> 10:05.005
Yeah, totally... totally... totally skipping.

10:06.074 --> 10:07.841
Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!

10:07.876 --> 10:09.710
What if we put him in a drug-induced coma

10:09.744 --> 10:11.645
and when he wakes up,
we'll tell him it's 10 years later

10:11.679 --> 10:12.980
- and that he lost his apartment?
- (Bonnie scoffs)

10:14.816 --> 10:15.916
I already did that once. (Clears throat)

10:17.552 --> 10:18.752
Okay, I know. We can get him drunk

10:18.786 --> 10:20.687
and then switch the numbers
on the apartment door.

10:20.722 --> 10:22.456
He'll wander around for hours.

10:23.725 --> 10:25.526
Wait, that was you, wasn't it?

10:26.594 --> 10:28.562
Ben, I told you that was your mom!

10:28.596 --> 10:30.430
Mmm! Mmm!

10:32.167 --> 10:33.233
- Ben!
- What?

10:33.268 --> 10:35.269
Sorry,
I was just busy watching my girlfriend

10:35.303 --> 10:37.804
spend quality time with
my brother once again.

10:37.839 --> 10:39.239
Ben, Riley loves you!

10:39.274 --> 10:41.008
You can't freak out every time

10:41.042 --> 10:43.610
she almost kisses him.

10:43.645 --> 10:45.012
Okay, that was a bad example.

10:46.514 --> 10:47.881
She said she didn't have
any time to help me,

10:47.916 --> 10:50.450
but the second Danny needed something,
she's all ears.

10:50.485 --> 10:53.320
I'm going to say something.
Should I say something? I'll say something.

10:54.622 --> 10:56.256
- (Mockingly) Can I say something?
- No.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.293
Hey, Riley? I need to say something.

10:59.327 --> 11:01.195
Oh! Is it about the lease?

11:01.229 --> 11:02.629
I meant to tell you. I looked it over

11:02.664 --> 11:06.166
and the only cause for termination
is if the original tenant dies.

11:06.201 --> 11:09.269
So, just to be clear,
we get to kill Mrs. Wheeler?

11:12.040 --> 11:14.675
Oh my God, the power of prayer really works.

11:17.011 --> 11:17.911
<i>(Knocking on door)</i>

11:19.847 --> 11:21.748
- Hello?
- Hi.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.419
I'm the landlord here,
so if I look familiar to you,

11:25.453 --> 11:28.255
that's why. No other reason.
Stop thinking about it.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.357
(Chuckles) Are you Bonnie
Wheeler's subletter?

11:30.391 --> 11:32.359
Yeah. What's this about?

11:32.393 --> 11:34.194
Oh. Bonnie's dead.

11:35.196 --> 11:36.230
Oh my God.

11:37.298 --> 11:39.099
That's terrible.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.002
Oh no, poor Ben! He must be a wreck.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.136
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's heartbroken.

11:43.171 --> 11:45.639
Anyway, your lease is null and void,

11:45.673 --> 11:48.909
- so you have to move out.
- Well, I'm not quite sure it works like that.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.578
- When's the funeral?
- I don't know. Tomorrow?

11:51.613 --> 11:53.714
And yeah, yeah, it does work like that.

11:53.748 --> 11:55.515
I'm the landlord. I should know.

11:55.550 --> 11:56.683
I... I mean I do know.

11:58.286 --> 11:59.453
All right. I get it.

11:59.487 --> 12:01.488
If there's nothing I can do,
I guess I'll pack up

12:01.522 --> 12:04.157
- after I get back from the funeral.
- Okay, cool.

12:05.393 --> 12:07.227
Wait, wait, hold up!

12:08.329 --> 12:10.097
Guess we are gonna have to kill her.

12:11.866 --> 12:13.267
Thanks, big guy.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.640
Hey! There's my little TV star.

12:19.674 --> 12:21.642
And you, would you like to be in this scene?

12:21.676 --> 12:23.944
Oh my God! Are you sure?

12:23.978 --> 12:25.846
I mean, I'm not really an actress.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.581
Then get the hell off my set.

12:30.518 --> 12:33.754
Hello, tall, dark, and dimply!

12:33.788 --> 12:36.390
All right, let's go, guys.
Let's go from the top of the scene.

12:36.424 --> 12:38.492
- You two ready?
- I have never been so ready.

12:38.526 --> 12:39.459
Director: Good. All right.

12:40.495 --> 12:42.029
Action!

12:42.063 --> 12:43.330
What are you doing here, Danny?

12:43.364 --> 12:45.999
Oh, just getting ready for my scene.

12:47.135 --> 12:49.169
Director: Okay, cut, please.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.038
Umm, Danny, this is the scene.

12:51.072 --> 12:53.040
Right, sorry. I just get confused,

12:53.074 --> 12:55.642
'cause my character's Danny, I'm Danny.

12:55.677 --> 12:57.778
It's okay, you're doing great.
It happens all the time.

12:57.812 --> 12:58.979
Yeah, okay. This never happens.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.617
All right, from the top, you two!

13:03.651 --> 13:04.651
Action.

13:04.686 --> 13:06.520
What are you doing here, Danny?

13:06.554 --> 13:08.722
I heard Zane died...

13:09.724 --> 13:11.358
In your arms.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.328
(Mockingly) Are you okay?

13:14.362 --> 13:17.364
- What's with the hands?
- Oh, it's called "acting."

13:19.334 --> 13:22.035
You're doing a really great job.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.837
See, now that's called "acting."

13:25.106 --> 13:28.141
Pete.
You can move your things back into my place.

13:29.811 --> 13:31.712
Oh God. All right.

13:31.746 --> 13:32.746
Let's take lunch, everybody.

13:32.780 --> 13:34.781
And you, take whatever you took yesterday

13:34.816 --> 13:36.483
that made you not so terrible, okay?

13:39.654 --> 13:41.555
Okay, it looks like they're on a break.

13:41.589 --> 13:43.690
Which means look alive, it's time to die.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.425
- Get in the box, mom.
- Yeah.

13:45.460 --> 13:49.363
Ooh, honey, remind me to get a
picture of this for your father.

13:49.397 --> 13:51.298
Christmas is coming up. He'll love it.

13:54.088 --> 13:57.377
Okay, okay, 20 bucks for each of you
when this is done,

13:57.477 --> 13:59.445
but I'm gonna need to see some real tears.

14:00.814 --> 14:03.082
Wait. Now is this a good time to
mention that I'm claustrophobic?

14:03.116 --> 14:06.251
(Sneezes) And allergic to chrysanthemums?

14:06.286 --> 14:09.054
Oh, and I really should've gone
to the bathroom. Oh God, oh God.

14:09.089 --> 14:11.090
- No, it is not a good time.
- Oh! Here he comes.

14:11.124 --> 14:13.993
Oh! Okay, and we're paying our respects,
and we're sad.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.195
- We're sad.
- Hey, Joshua. How's it going?

14:16.229 --> 14:18.764
Personally, I'm devastated.

14:18.798 --> 14:21.033
Ben, I'm so sorry. I...

14:21.067 --> 14:23.035
This is a strange place for a funeral.

14:23.069 --> 14:25.604
Yeah, well, my mom was a makeup artist here,

14:25.639 --> 14:27.740
and she just wanted to be with
the people she loved the most.

14:27.774 --> 14:29.708
Where's the cast?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.411
Mrs. Wheeler only did the extras' makeup,

14:32.445 --> 14:35.180
which is why none of these
people are very attractive.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.350
Well, we should probably get started.
Come on, take your seat.

14:38.385 --> 14:40.119
- Sure.
- Yes, thank you.

14:40.153 --> 14:41.353
Hey, let me get your eye drops.

14:41.388 --> 14:44.023
- I might need some tears to help sell this.
- All right.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.958
Thanks, man. (Exhales sharply)

14:48.094 --> 14:51.030
- Okay. Welcome.
- (Sneezes)

14:51.064 --> 14:53.932
(Mimics sneeze) Excuse me.

14:55.702 --> 14:57.503
We are gathered here today

14:57.537 --> 14:58.671
to remember a life...

14:59.806 --> 15:01.473
A woman who loved...

15:02.609 --> 15:04.710
Well... herself, for one thing.

15:06.513 --> 15:07.646
So in conclusion...

15:09.215 --> 15:10.349
(Crying) I just wanna say...

15:11.351 --> 15:14.153
I'm sorry, guys, it's just...

15:14.187 --> 15:16.922
There's just so many emotions, man.

15:17.957 --> 15:19.291
Ow! My eye!

15:19.325 --> 15:21.060
These are breath drops!

15:22.162 --> 15:24.063
- (Sneezing)
- (Mimicking sneezing)

15:24.097 --> 15:26.131
So rest in peace...

15:26.166 --> 15:28.100
Oh! Oh!

15:28.134 --> 15:30.669
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God, is he okay?

15:30.704 --> 15:32.004
- Hold me.
- Tucker: I'm bleeding.

15:32.038 --> 15:34.773
I can't see. Okay, as we say goodbye

15:34.808 --> 15:36.775
- to Mrs. Wheeler...
- (Sneezes)

15:36.843 --> 15:38.677
- (Sneezing)
- (Mimicking sneezing)

15:39.679 --> 15:42.281
Goodbye. We are almost to the end.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.350
(Chuckles) And that's it! We made it!

15:45.385 --> 15:46.685
Thank you all for coming out!

15:46.720 --> 15:49.221
Hey, hey, didn't anybody get the rewrite?

15:49.255 --> 15:50.355
We're 86-ing the coffin.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.523
Come on, guys,
we're shooting in five minutes.

15:51.558 --> 15:53.092
Let's go, let's go. Lose that.

15:55.328 --> 15:57.262
(People gasping)

15:57.297 --> 16:00.265
- Oh my God!
- Praise mercy!

16:00.300 --> 16:02.234
She's alive, y'all!

16:02.268 --> 16:04.236
Whoo! Oh.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.772
Man, that is definitely the last time

16:06.806 --> 16:08.807
I agree to test sleeping pills.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.579
- Ben: Hello, mom.
- What the hell is going on?

16:13.613 --> 16:15.414
Why did you do all this?

16:15.448 --> 16:17.516
Okay, here's the truth:

16:17.550 --> 16:20.385
My mom has been living with us because
she sublet her apartment to you.

16:20.420 --> 16:22.454
It's been a little difficult,
because she's kind of a nightmare.

16:23.623 --> 16:25.491
You did all this to get me to move out?

16:25.525 --> 16:27.259
Why didn't you just ask me?

16:28.328 --> 16:29.428
Oh yeah.

16:31.064 --> 16:32.331
Guess I kinda skipped that step.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.167
Hey, could I get my apartment back?

16:36.169 --> 16:38.704
Honestly, I really wanna say no,

16:38.738 --> 16:41.640
but I would really like
to keep dating your son

16:41.674 --> 16:44.009
so... I guess... sure.

16:45.545 --> 16:46.779
Yeah, about that.

16:46.813 --> 16:48.514
I'm gay like she's dead.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.285
Well, I'm gone like your apartment is.

16:53.319 --> 16:54.653
Good luck finding a place to live.

16:54.687 --> 16:57.422
- (Bonnie scoffs)
- Tucker: What?

16:58.558 --> 17:00.292
Seriously?

17:00.326 --> 17:02.494
You couldn't pretend to
be gay for 20 minutes?

17:02.529 --> 17:05.263
Your father pretended to
be straight for 20 years!

17:07.967 --> 17:11.236
Okay, Danny,
just try to forget how badly you screwed up

17:11.271 --> 17:12.871
and that everybody's upset with you.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.007
Just... just do it exactly like

17:15.040 --> 17:16.974
we did on the fire escape, okay?

17:17.010 --> 17:18.877
You got this. Good luck.

17:20.113 --> 17:21.980
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh!

17:22.015 --> 17:23.949
I was afraid you were gonna miss his scene.
Where have you been?

17:23.983 --> 17:26.885
Oh, I was just playing hide-and-seek
with one of the security guards.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.787
Hey, let me know if you see him,
'cause I'm it.

17:30.456 --> 17:32.424
Look,
I'm so sorry I got so bent out of shape

17:32.458 --> 17:34.293
about you spending so much time with Danny.

17:34.327 --> 17:36.428
It's okay. Just... (Inhales sharply)

17:36.462 --> 17:38.197
I hope all my coaching helped.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.365
Good,
so let's go from the top of the second scene.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.035
Okay? Here we go, you two.

17:43.069 --> 17:44.203
And action!

17:45.905 --> 17:48.073
I thought my heart would be broken forever.

17:49.075 --> 17:51.043
But now that you're here, I'm healed.

17:52.045 --> 17:55.614
You are a heart healer, Danny Wheeler.

17:55.648 --> 17:57.916
I never thought that a guy like me

17:57.951 --> 17:59.751
would meet a girl like you,

17:59.786 --> 18:01.420
much less fall in love...

18:01.454 --> 18:02.788
- (Mouths)
- ...So fast,

18:02.822 --> 18:04.556
so hard, so fully.

18:05.592 --> 18:07.392
I hope it's not too soon to say this, but...

18:08.394 --> 18:09.561
I love you, Riley.

18:09.596 --> 18:11.530
Oh, I... really...

18:11.564 --> 18:14.066
I love you really, Riley.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.467
No, I love you really, Kelly...

18:15.501 --> 18:18.103
- no, Samantha! Cut!
- (Shrieks)

18:20.240 --> 18:21.940
Nice coaching.

18:32.752 --> 18:33.719
Hey.

18:33.753 --> 18:35.587
Can I buy you a beer?

18:37.523 --> 18:38.790
You wanna talk about what just happened?

18:40.526 --> 18:43.295
You mean how the director
had a nervous breakdown?

18:43.329 --> 18:44.696
I'm talking about you and Danny.

18:44.731 --> 18:47.666
- (Clears throat)
- Something I seem to do a lot of lately.

18:49.202 --> 18:52.204
We rehearsed that scene a million times.

18:52.238 --> 18:54.473
He got confused. It could happen to anybody.

18:54.507 --> 18:56.008
Could it?

18:57.243 --> 19:00.145
I just can't help feeling that
you two have something more,

19:00.179 --> 19:01.980
and I don't even think that you realize it.

19:02.982 --> 19:05.217
- Ben, he's my...
- Your best friend. Yeah, I know.

19:05.251 --> 19:07.753
You say that more often than you say
"boyfriend."

19:07.787 --> 19:10.122
- Well, it's true, he is!
- Oh, come on, Riley!

19:10.156 --> 19:12.090
You have to see it!

19:13.126 --> 19:14.927
That moment on the roof?

19:14.961 --> 19:17.629
The love note?
You hiding him and lying to me?

19:18.831 --> 19:20.666
I can't do this.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.602
I can't be in a relationship where
I'm constantly questioning everything.

19:24.637 --> 19:26.471
I always feel like I'm in second place.

19:28.441 --> 19:29.408
Wait.

19:30.476 --> 19:31.677
Are you breaking up with me?

19:32.745 --> 19:35.547
Because that's not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:35.581 --> 19:37.316
Can you look me in the eyes right now

19:37.350 --> 19:39.251
and tell me that you don't
have feelings for Danny?

19:39.285 --> 19:42.454
But I spent my whole life
being in love with you.

19:42.488 --> 19:46.358
I never even had a minute to think
about how I feel about Danny.

19:46.392 --> 19:47.526
(Voice breaking) Well,
maybe it's time you did.

19:50.563 --> 19:52.431
And maybe we take a time out while you do.

19:53.499 --> 19:55.367
- Ben.
- I'm sorry, Riley.

19:58.338 --> 19:59.338
I just...

20:00.373 --> 20:01.473
I don't know what else to do.

20:02.575 --> 20:03.675
I love you, but...

20:04.711 --> 20:06.411
Something just doesn't feel right.

20:15.488 --> 20:17.356
(Crying)

20:23.292 --> 20:26.094
- What do you want?
- Hello, roomie.

20:26.128 --> 20:27.762
You're not coming in here.

20:27.797 --> 20:29.097
Absolutely nothing in that lease

20:29.131 --> 20:31.066
says that I won't be living here with you.

20:32.134 --> 20:33.902
Joshua: This isn't gonna get rid of me.

20:33.936 --> 20:36.204
Bonnie: Well, take a look at these.

20:36.238 --> 20:38.039
Joshua: I've seen those.

20:38.074 --> 20:39.808
Bonnie: How about one of these?

20:39.842 --> 20:40.976
Joshua: Oh my God.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.244
- I'm out of here.
- Same way I got rid

20:43.279 --> 20:46.014
of my ex-husband! Buh-bye!

20:47.305 --> 20:53.273
