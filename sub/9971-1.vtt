-( tires screeching )
-( crash )

00:31.362 --> 00:35.199
## ASKED THAT GIRL
WHAT SHE WANTED TO BE ##

00:35.199 --> 00:39.136
## AND SHE SAID, BABY, CAN'T YOU SEE? ##

00:39.136 --> 00:42.873
## I WANNA BE THE FAMOUS,
A STAR OF THE SCREEN ##

00:42.873 --> 00:44.775
## BUT YOU CAN DO ##

00:44.775 --> 00:46.777
## SOMETHING IN BETWEEN ##

00:46.777 --> 00:49.413
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

00:50.648 --> 00:53.417
## YES, I'M GONNA BE A STAR ##

00:54.852 --> 00:57.688
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

00:57.688 --> 01:00.091
## AND BABY, I LOVE YOU ##

01:03.094 --> 01:07.031
## I TOLD THAT GIRL THAT
MY PROSPECTS WERE GOOD ##

01:07.031 --> 01:10.935
## AND SHE SAID, BABY,
IT'S UNDERSTOOD ##

01:10.935 --> 01:14.505
## WORKING FOR PEANUTS
IS ALL VERY FINE ##

01:14.505 --> 01:18.609
## BUT I CAN SHOW YOU A BETTER TIME ##

01:18.609 --> 01:21.345
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

01:22.747 --> 01:25.349
## YES, I'M GONNA BE A STAR ##

01:26.650 --> 01:29.120
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

01:29.120 --> 01:32.723
## AND BABY, I LOVE YOU ##

01:32.723 --> 01:35.392
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH ##

01:36.827 --> 01:39.230
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH ##

01:40.898 --> 01:43.000
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH! ##

02:16.767 --> 02:19.170
( sawing metal )

03:03.881 --> 03:06.617
( laughing maniacally )

03:28.472 --> 03:30.141
( continues laughing )

03:42.086 --> 03:44.388
( tires squealing )

03:54.432 --> 03:56.467
( growling )

04:54.925 --> 04:59.029
Man's voice: Remember, the driver
must always see the big picture.

04:59.029 --> 05:01.298
When driving through
puddles or in heavy rain,

05:01.298 --> 05:03.601
your tires may
begin to hydroplane--

05:03.601 --> 05:06.137
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement.

05:06.137 --> 05:08.205
If this happens to you, don't panic

05:08.205 --> 05:11.242
and especially don't jam on your brakes.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.611
In this actual scientific demonstration,

05:13.611 --> 05:15.946
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water

05:15.946 --> 05:19.049
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely.

05:39.203 --> 05:41.372
( laughs )

05:44.408 --> 05:46.410
( tires screech )

05:46.410 --> 05:48.212
( bell rings )

05:51.282 --> 05:53.317
DOES YOUR BROTHER
HAVE MONO OR SOMETHING?

05:53.317 --> 05:56.353
- HE SLEPT THROUGH THE ENTIRE COURSE.
- NO.

05:56.353 --> 05:58.722
HE'S JUST BRAIN-DEAD.

06:00.558 --> 06:03.294
MR. ANDERSON.

06:03.294 --> 06:06.263
IT'S PUNKS LIKE YOU THAT PARAMEDICS

06:06.263 --> 06:09.233
END UP SCRAPING OFF THE
ROAD AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

06:09.233 --> 06:12.303
FOR YOUR SAKE AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS,

06:12.303 --> 06:15.473
I HOPE YOU FAIL YOUR DRIVING EXAM.

06:29.887 --> 06:31.655
( engine revving )

06:31.655 --> 06:33.724
WAIT UP!

06:33.724 --> 06:35.726
WAIT UP! MY BUS!

06:45.302 --> 06:47.538
- ( honking )
- ( tires screech )

06:59.683 --> 07:02.486
YOU KNOW, DEAN, I CAN'T HELP WONDERING,

07:02.486 --> 07:04.722
IS IT EVER GONNA GET THAT GOOD FOR ME?

07:04.722 --> 07:08.659
ANDERSON, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND THAT GREASEBALL

07:08.659 --> 07:11.595
- IS THAT HE HAS A LICENSE, AND YOU DON'T.
- ( tires screech )

07:13.197 --> 07:15.332
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

07:15.332 --> 07:16.967
SCUMBAG!

07:21.739 --> 07:23.908
GET ON IT. I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

07:23.908 --> 07:27.044
NO WAY, MAN. I HAVE A
DRIVER'S EXAM TO TAKE SATURDAY.

07:27.044 --> 07:28.913
- I DON'T WANT TO GET KILLED.
- LES.

07:28.913 --> 07:32.416
YOUR LICENSE IS JUST AS
IMPORTANT TO ME AS IT IS TO YOU.

07:32.416 --> 07:35.619
I'LL TAKE IT EASY.

07:35.619 --> 07:37.221
TRUST ME.

07:37.221 --> 07:39.623
Dean: WHOO-HOO! YEAH!

07:39.623 --> 07:41.892
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT!

07:41.892 --> 07:43.194
DEAN! DEAN!

07:46.397 --> 07:49.467
- Man: I'LL GET YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICK!
- DEAN!

07:49.467 --> 07:50.901
( tires screech )

08:00.911 --> 08:03.481
- Dean: Hee-hee-hee-hee!
- Les: Whoa!

08:07.284 --> 08:09.153
HERE YOU GO!

08:09.153 --> 08:11.255
FRONT-DOOR SERVICE!

08:11.255 --> 08:14.725
- GREAT. THANKS.
- WOW!

08:14.725 --> 08:16.460
Dean: WHOSE CADDY?

08:16.460 --> 08:19.563
IT'S MY GRANDFATHER'S.
16 YEARS OLD, MAN,

08:19.563 --> 08:22.099
AND IT ONLY HAS 20,000 MILES ON IT.

08:22.099 --> 08:24.268
WOW!

08:24.268 --> 08:27.705
- WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?
- MY GRANDDAD'S AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON LONG TRIPS,

08:27.705 --> 08:30.007
SO HE BORROWED MY DAD'S CAR FOR A WEEK.

08:30.007 --> 08:33.277
DO YOU KNOW THIS BOAT WOULD KICK ASS

08:33.277 --> 08:35.279
UP AT ARCHIES?

08:35.279 --> 08:38.115
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
WE CAN GET IT SATURDAY NIGHT?

08:38.115 --> 08:39.984
- NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.
- NO WAY.

08:39.984 --> 08:42.686
- HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?
- I'M JUST CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE,

08:42.686 --> 08:45.289
MAKING SOME ROOM FOR THE
OLD BOAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:45.289 --> 08:48.325
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, YOU WANT TO GIVE US A HAND?
- HEY, DEANO!

08:48.325 --> 08:51.328
I'D LOVE TO, MR. ANDERSON,
BUT I JUST REMEMBERED--

08:51.328 --> 08:53.130
( coughs )

08:53.130 --> 08:56.467
I'M ALLERGIC TO DUST AND CARDBOARD BOXES

08:56.467 --> 08:59.770
( coughs ) I GOTTA GO.
SEE YOU TONIGHT, LES!

08:59.770 --> 09:02.706
- SEE YOU TONIGHT, DEANO.
- TAKE CARE OF THAT COUGH, DEAN.

09:02.706 --> 09:04.775
- DAD?
- YEAH.

09:04.775 --> 09:06.977
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY WAY YOU CAN TELL ME

09:06.977 --> 09:08.979
IF I CAN BORROW MOM'S
CAR SATURDAY NIGHT?

09:08.979 --> 09:12.383
HERE'S THE DEAL, LES. FIRST GET
YOUR LICENSE, THEN WE'LL TALK.

09:20.257 --> 09:21.859
Mr. Anderson: NATALIE!

09:21.859 --> 09:24.195
WHAT NICE HAPPENED TO WHO TODAY?

09:24.195 --> 09:26.397
WHAT INTERESTING NEWS?

09:26.397 --> 09:29.934
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( chatting stops )

09:49.420 --> 09:51.722
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I ATE

09:51.722 --> 09:55.259
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH ALL
OF YOU. YOU TURNED OUT OKAY.

09:55.259 --> 09:56.961
- Les: DAD?
-YEP?

09:56.961 --> 09:59.997
DID YOU, UM, LOOK AT
THE BROCHURE I GAVE YOU?

09:59.997 --> 10:02.133
-YOU BET.
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?

10:02.133 --> 10:05.035
WELL, A $23,000 BMW

10:05.035 --> 10:08.439
FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD KID WHO'S
NEVER HAD A JOB A DAY IN HIS LIFE?

10:08.439 --> 10:10.474
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

10:10.474 --> 10:12.943
BUT DAD, THE CAR
WOULDN'T ONLY BE FOR ME.

10:12.943 --> 10:15.446
I MEAN, SHE CAN USE IT TOO!

10:15.446 --> 10:17.815
DON'T INCLUDEME IN YOUR OBSESSIONS.

10:17.815 --> 10:20.885
LES, ISN'T IT PREMATURE TO BE
TALKING ABOUT GETTING A CAR?

10:20.885 --> 10:23.654
YOU JUST FINISHED YOUR DRIVER'S
ED COURSE TWO HOURS AGO.

10:23.654 --> 10:27.258
KARL SAYS THAT IN AMERICA,
PEOPLE ARE MISLEAD TO BELIEVE

10:27.258 --> 10:30.828
- THAT A CAR REPRESENTS FREEDOM
AND INDIVIDUALITY-- - RIGHT.

10:30.828 --> 10:35.065
WHEN IN ESSENCE, IT IS MORE
OPPRESSIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

10:35.065 --> 10:37.902
BURDENING THE INDIVIDUAL
WITH SUCH MATERIALISTIC COST--

10:37.902 --> 10:41.338
WAIT, WHO CARES WHAT YOUR
COMMIE BOYFRIEND THINKS?

10:41.338 --> 10:44.508
- I SEE IT'S GREAT TO BE AN AMERICAN.
- I AGREE.

10:44.508 --> 10:46.143
YES!

10:46.143 --> 10:48.879
THIS IS THE MOST OPPRESSIVE
ENVIRONMENT A CHILD CAN BE RAISED IN.

10:48.879 --> 10:51.849
NATALIE, ONE DAY SOON,
IT WILL ALL BE OVER.

10:51.849 --> 10:54.652
- YOU'LL GO AWAY.
-( honking )

10:54.652 --> 10:57.188
( honks )

10:57.188 --> 10:59.123
ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT OF HERE.

10:59.123 --> 11:02.426
HEY, BUDDY, DOWN!

11:02.426 --> 11:04.762
( honking continues )

11:09.467 --> 11:12.036
Dean: YO, LET'S GO!

11:12.036 --> 11:15.372
-( honking continues )
-LES, COME ON, GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE!

11:16.474 --> 11:18.242
LES!

11:18.242 --> 11:20.611
- ( honking )
- GET DOWN HERE, LES!

11:24.315 --> 11:26.183
- GET OUT!
- OUT!

11:26.183 --> 11:28.853
RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

11:28.853 --> 11:32.456
## SWEET, SWEET SURRENDER... ##

11:34.458 --> 11:36.927
- MOM-- - WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

11:36.927 --> 11:38.629
DUCK DOWN! DUCK DOWN!

11:38.629 --> 11:41.632
Dean: MOM, MOM! NO, DON'T STOP HERE.

11:41.632 --> 11:44.435
- GO, GO!
- IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, DEAN?

11:44.435 --> 11:46.270
NO, IT'S NOT THE CAR, IT'S YOU.

11:46.270 --> 11:49.473
- YOU'RE DRIVING. PLEASE, JUST GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:57.214 --> 12:01.419
- THANKS, MOM. DRIVE SAFELY.
- Boy: HEY, DWEEBS!

12:01.419 --> 12:04.188
DOES MOMMY HOLD YOUR
DICKS WHEN YOU PISS?

12:04.188 --> 12:07.625
( laughing )

12:07.625 --> 12:10.594
SORRY, MOM, I DIDN'T INTRODUCE
YOU. THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS.

12:10.594 --> 12:13.731
- OH. GOOD NIGHT
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

12:15.733 --> 12:18.302
## WHEN  YOUR LIFE MEETS MINE ##

12:18.302 --> 12:22.406
## YOU REACH WAY DOWN INSIDE... ##

12:23.474 --> 12:25.009
THANKS, MOM.

12:26.410 --> 12:27.945
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

12:27.945 --> 12:30.047
- IGNORE.
-BYE, MOM!

12:30.047 --> 12:31.882
- Mom: BE CAREFUL!
- HEY, GUYS!

12:31.882 --> 12:34.952
HEY, GUYS! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:34.952 --> 12:38.789
GUYS! HEY, GUYS, IT'S ME, CHARLES!

12:38.789 --> 12:41.192
( dance music playing )

12:45.996 --> 12:48.833
OH, BABY!

12:48.833 --> 12:51.902
HEY, DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT KIND OF CAR

12:51.902 --> 12:54.371
SOME OF THESE BABES WOULD
LOSE THEIR VIRGINITY IN?

12:54.371 --> 12:57.007
YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME, DEANO.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.009
NO, SERIOUSLY. OKAY,

12:59.009 --> 13:00.745
LOOK AT SHERYL LIEBERMAN.

13:00.745 --> 13:03.881
Charles: A V.W. CONVERTIBLE.

13:03.881 --> 13:06.951
SHERYL LIEBERMAN? TRANS AM.

13:08.452 --> 13:12.323
- BETH MacCLAIN.
- Les: A VOLVO. NO, WAIT.

13:12.323 --> 13:14.525
-A STATION WAGON.
-( all three laugh )

13:15.659 --> 13:18.696
OKAY, I GOT ONE FOR YOU. BONNIE DUPER.

13:18.696 --> 13:22.433
- Les: A CARGO VAN.
- Charles: A GARBAGE TRUCK!

13:29.507 --> 13:31.175
MERCEDES.

13:32.243 --> 13:34.345
MERCEDES LANE.

13:34.345 --> 13:36.614
I'VE BUMPED INTO HER A MILLION TIMES.

13:36.614 --> 13:38.382
SHE'S NEVER BUMPED INTO ME ONCE.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.085
- COME WITH ME.
- NO, LISTEN, YOU DON'T OWN ME.

13:41.085 --> 13:43.020
WOMEN HAVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY.

13:43.020 --> 13:46.357
NOT LIKE KUWAIT OR PAKISTAN
WHERE THEY WORSHIP THEIR MEN.

13:46.357 --> 13:49.126
MERCEDES, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH WORSHIP.

13:49.126 --> 13:51.996
IT HAS TO DO WITH GOING
TO PARTIES WITH KIDS!

13:51.996 --> 13:54.465
I HAPPEN TO GO TO
SCHOOL WITH THESE KIDS.

13:54.465 --> 13:57.234
- I HAVE FRIENDS HERE.
- FRIENDS, YES. FRIENDS, OKAY.

13:57.234 --> 14:00.538
BUT THESE ARE CHILDREN.
THEY CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU.

14:00.538 --> 14:03.941
MERCEDES, I'M BEGINNING TO...

14:05.609 --> 14:07.111
PERSPIRE.

14:07.111 --> 14:09.213
YOU KNOW THAT I HATE TO PERSPIRE.

14:09.213 --> 14:10.614
NOW LET US GO.

14:10.614 --> 14:12.917
I THINK I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY HOME,

14:12.917 --> 14:15.419
-THANK YOU.
- DON'T DO THIS, MERCEDES.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.022
AND PAOLO, IF YOU'RE
WONDERING ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT,

14:18.022 --> 14:20.424
I JUST REMEMBERED I ALREADY HAVE A DATE.

14:20.424 --> 14:23.394
YOU HAVE A DATE? WITH WHO?

14:25.863 --> 14:28.733
- WITH HIM.
- WITH ME?

14:28.733 --> 14:30.568
DIDN'T WE MAKE ARRANGEMENTS?

14:30.568 --> 14:33.537
YEAH, I-- I
BELIEVE SO.

14:33.537 --> 14:36.774
BUT NOTHING WAS FINAL.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.578
WELL, NOW THEY'RE FINAL.

14:41.812 --> 14:43.314
CIAO!

14:45.516 --> 14:47.551
HEY, WATCH IT!

14:48.953 --> 14:50.521
THANKS.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.298
LES, I HAVE THE ANSWER.

15:01.298 --> 15:03.434
WHAT DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HER, TO MAKE SURE?

15:03.434 --> 15:07.037
I'D LOVE TO, CHARLES, BUT I CAN'T
TALK TO SOMETHING I CAN'T SEE, RIGHT?

15:07.037 --> 15:09.807
LAST NIGHT WAS THE CLOSEST ANY
OF US HAVE EVER BEEN TO HER.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.409
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK, LOVERBOY,

15:11.409 --> 15:13.611
'CAUSE SHE'S SITTING
DOWN RIGHT OVER THERE.

15:18.115 --> 15:21.485
- WAIT, WAIT, DEAN. I CAN'T DO IT, MAN!
- GO ON, ASK HER.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.855
IF YOU'RE LUCKY, SHE'LL BITE. ( laughs )

15:31.695 --> 15:33.998
Dean: GO FOR IT!

15:36.500 --> 15:39.737
-( honking )
- LES!

15:39.737 --> 15:41.072
LES.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.308
LES?

15:47.445 --> 15:49.880
LES, IT'S ME, PAPA!

15:51.382 --> 15:54.118
- LES, WAIT UP!
- ( honks )

15:54.118 --> 15:56.754
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? LES?

15:58.389 --> 16:01.692
WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING A FATHER?

16:01.692 --> 16:04.361
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:04.361 --> 16:06.697
I HAD TO RUN SOME ERRANDS
FOR YOUR MOM AFTER WORK

16:06.697 --> 16:08.933
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP
BY AND TAKE YOU DRIVING.

16:08.933 --> 16:12.269
I FIGURE, IF YOU CAN HANDLE THIS
CRUISER YOU CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

16:12.269 --> 16:15.106
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?

16:15.106 --> 16:18.509
- WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING WITHMYCAR. GET IN.
- YEAH!

16:19.977 --> 16:22.947
- DAD, HERE COMES A STOP SIGN.
- NICE CALL.

16:22.947 --> 16:25.249
( radio playing )

16:25.249 --> 16:27.351
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

16:28.652 --> 16:30.621
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A
RIGHT TURN RIGHT HERE?

16:31.856 --> 16:33.858
- WHAT?
- I HAVE TO ASK YOU A FAVOR,

16:33.858 --> 16:35.659
AND YOU COULD SAY NO.

16:35.659 --> 16:38.729
BUT I WILL NEVER, EVER ASK YOU FOR
ANOTHER FAVOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.

16:38.729 --> 16:42.299
LES, YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.

16:42.299 --> 16:44.802
OKAY, SEE THAT GIRL OVER THERE WALKING?

16:44.802 --> 16:45.970
DAD!

16:45.970 --> 16:48.439
THAT IS THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.

16:48.439 --> 16:51.242
OKAY, OKAY.

16:51.242 --> 16:53.077
- LET'S GIVE HER A CRUISE!
- DAD.

16:53.077 --> 16:56.480
DAD, SHH! LOOK,

16:56.480 --> 16:59.917
- SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT LAST NIGHT, DAD.
- YEAH?

16:59.917 --> 17:01.986
NOW, IF I DROVE BY HER

17:01.986 --> 17:05.156
WITH YOU IN THE
CAR WITH ME--

17:05.156 --> 17:08.192
NO OFFENSE, IT JUST WOULDN'T
WORK. YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:08.192 --> 17:12.029
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LET YOU DRIVE
THIS CAR ALONE WITHOUT A LICENSE.

17:12.029 --> 17:14.898
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!
- I'M JUST GONNA GO UP TO HER,

17:14.898 --> 17:18.102
CIRCLE AROUND, MAYBE SAY HELLO
TO HER AND COME RIGHT BACK.

17:18.102 --> 17:19.869
TWO MINUTES! I'LL BE CAREFUL, DAD.

17:21.405 --> 17:23.473
- SURE.
- THANKS.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.576
- BE CAREFUL.
- I WILL, I PROMISE.

17:25.576 --> 17:27.877
- I TRUST YOU.
- THANKS, DAD.

17:29.980 --> 17:32.383
- OH AND, DAD, DAD!
-YEAH?

17:32.383 --> 17:34.018
WOULD YOU MIND?

17:45.563 --> 17:48.432
- ( honks )
- MERCEDES!

17:48.432 --> 17:51.469
MERCEDES? LES ANDERSON, FROM THE PARTY

17:51.469 --> 17:54.105
LAST NIGHT.

17:54.105 --> 17:56.607
OH. OH, HI!

17:56.607 --> 17:58.609
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

17:58.609 --> 18:00.978
HOP IN, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

18:02.079 --> 18:03.514
SURE.

18:03.514 --> 18:04.982
HOLD ON!

18:11.322 --> 18:13.057
AFTER YOU, MADAME.

18:27.271 --> 18:29.940
OKAY, SO, WHICH HOUSE IS YOURS?

18:29.940 --> 18:32.076
- THIRD ONE ON
THE LEFT. - OKAY--

18:32.076 --> 18:35.212
BUT, I'M NOT GOING HOME.

18:35.212 --> 18:37.848
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:37.848 --> 18:40.518
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE, IN CEDARWOOD.

18:40.518 --> 18:42.787
YOU DON'T MIND, SO YOU?

18:50.561 --> 18:52.430
NOT AT ALL.

18:57.768 --> 18:59.570
LES?

19:00.838 --> 19:02.807
LES?!

19:02.807 --> 19:04.308
LES!

19:04.308 --> 19:07.445
LES!

19:07.445 --> 19:09.146
LES!

19:16.821 --> 19:19.790
- THANKS A LOT.
- WAIT, WAIT!

19:19.790 --> 19:21.459
MERCEDES!

19:21.459 --> 19:25.262
LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY,

19:25.262 --> 19:27.565
YOU KIND OF MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

19:27.565 --> 19:30.267
ME AND YOU MAYBE GOING
OUT SATURDAY NIGHT.

19:30.267 --> 19:32.136
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST

19:32.136 --> 19:35.806
WONDERING IF IT WAS STILL ON.

19:35.806 --> 19:38.776
SURE. CALL ME TOMORROW.

19:38.776 --> 19:41.245
LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER
IN CASE SOMETHING COMES UP.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.783
- OH, HERE. WRITE IT ON THIS.
- GREAT.

19:47.084 --> 19:50.388
THANKS A LOT FOR THE RIDE, LES.

19:50.388 --> 19:53.157
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.244
( growls )

20:16.147 --> 20:18.315
HOW COULD YOU DO IT, LES?

20:18.315 --> 20:20.451
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

20:20.451 --> 20:22.553
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I MEAN...

20:22.553 --> 20:25.923
NOT ONLY DID YOU BREAK
YOUR EXPLICIT PROMISE TO ME,

20:25.923 --> 20:29.627
BUT YOU USED UP YOUR LAST FAVOR.

20:29.627 --> 20:32.596
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS LEAVES YOU, DON'T YOU?

20:32.596 --> 20:34.932
- NOT IN GOOD SHAPE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:34.932 --> 20:37.468
LOOK, DAD, JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, OKAY?

20:37.468 --> 20:39.970
SHE TOLD ME SHE LIVED THREE HOUSES DOWN.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.639
I THOUGHT I WAS TAKING HER HOME.

20:41.639 --> 20:43.441
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER THE TRUTH?

20:43.441 --> 20:45.409
TELL MERCEDES LANE THE TRUTH,

20:45.409 --> 20:48.746
- THAT LES ANDERSON DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE?
- YES.

20:48.746 --> 20:51.715
AND RISK HER HAVING A HEART
ATTACK FROM LAUGHING SO HARD AT ME?

20:51.715 --> 20:54.051
Mr. Anderson: HER? HER
HAVING A HEART ATTACK?

20:54.051 --> 20:57.154
LOOK, DAD, PLEASE PUT
YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.

21:00.357 --> 21:02.793
LOOK, YOU'RE UPSETTING YOUR MOTHER.

21:02.793 --> 21:04.195
SHE'S PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

21:05.663 --> 21:07.531
Dean: DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS

21:07.531 --> 21:09.667
IF YOU GET CAUGHT
DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE?

21:09.667 --> 21:12.470
THEY MAKE YOU WAIT TWO YEARS
BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.

21:12.470 --> 21:15.272
THAT'S 24 MONTHS. THAT'S
AN AWFUL LOT OF BUS RIDES.

21:15.272 --> 21:17.608
RELAX, DEANO. I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.

21:17.608 --> 21:21.245
AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE
EXACT SAME THING THAT I DID.

21:21.245 --> 21:24.248
NOW, DID YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE
TO ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS, OR WHAT?

21:25.349 --> 21:27.485
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE:

21:27.485 --> 21:31.255
"HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY A BLIND PEDESTRIAN

21:31.255 --> 21:33.224
TO WHOM YOU MUST YIELD
THE RIGHT OF WAY?"

21:33.224 --> 21:35.092
THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

21:35.092 --> 21:37.995
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST MOVED
HERE FROM BEDROCK OR SOMETHING.

21:37.995 --> 21:40.164
YOU'VE BEEN A PASSENGER
IN A CAR ALL YOUR LIFE.

21:40.164 --> 21:43.334
-( classical music plays )
- AND WHAT IS THIS SHIT?

21:46.036 --> 21:48.639
NATALIE!

21:48.639 --> 21:51.008
HEY, NATALIE, I WAS WONDERING,

21:51.008 --> 21:52.877
IF YOU'RE DRIVING 55 MILES PER HOUR

21:52.877 --> 21:54.879
AND YOU COLLIDE WITH A RUNAWAY TRAIN,

21:54.879 --> 21:57.748
WOULD IT MAKE
ANYIMPROVEMENTS ON YOUR FACE?

21:57.748 --> 22:00.751
- ( Dean laughs )
- ( burps )

22:04.021 --> 22:07.224
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAM
TOMORROW, EINSTEIN!

22:09.660 --> 22:12.530
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHILDREN!

22:12.530 --> 22:16.567
IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES, YOU
WILL BE GIVEN 30 QUESTIONS.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.636
ANYTHING OVER FIVE MISTAKES

22:18.636 --> 22:21.705
WILL BE CONSIDERED A FAILING GRADE.

22:21.705 --> 22:25.042
WE'LL BEGIN AT THE SOUND OF THE BELL.

22:27.378 --> 22:28.913
-( bell rings )
- BEGIN.

22:33.217 --> 22:36.520

22:51.769 --> 22:55.072
- HA!
-Question two:

22:55.072 --> 22:57.475
Which is usually the
smoothest lane of traffic?

22:57.475 --> 23:00.678
WHY DON'T THEY JUST GIVE LICENSES AWAY?

23:00.678 --> 23:03.647
-Incorrect.
- WHAT?

23:09.687 --> 23:12.490
Question three: You must
look for bicycle riders

23:12.490 --> 23:15.292
in the same lanes used by
motor vehicles, because they...

23:15.292 --> 23:17.661
A: Must ride facing oncoming traffic;

23:17.661 --> 23:20.097
B: Are entitled to
share the road with you;

23:20.097 --> 23:22.566
C: Always have the right of way.

23:27.138 --> 23:29.907

23:33.110 --> 23:35.112
( overlapping questions )

23:45.289 --> 23:48.392
...C: Stop.

23:48.392 --> 23:50.628
Incorrect.

23:50.628 --> 23:53.697
Warning, one more wrong and you fail!

23:59.003 --> 24:00.704
FINISHED!

24:03.207 --> 24:04.975
Question 26.

24:04.975 --> 24:08.412
At 55 miles per hour you come

foot off the gas pedal;

24:14.151 --> 24:16.220

24:27.231 --> 24:29.900

24:39.910 --> 24:41.712

24:41.712 --> 24:43.981
- Student £2: WHAT HAPPENED?
-I LOST MY SCREEN.

24:43.981 --> 24:46.016
SOMEONE PULL THE PLUG OR SOMETHING?

24:47.852 --> 24:50.721
MR. ANDERSON. MR. ANDERSON!

24:50.721 --> 24:53.090
MR. ANDERSON. OH, MR. ANDERSON.

24:53.090 --> 24:56.494
YOU CAN THANK YOUR SISTER FOR THIS ONE.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.329
- I CAN?
- UH-HUH.

24:58.329 --> 25:00.264
DUE TO A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION,

25:00.264 --> 25:02.800
WE ARE UNABLE TO SEARCH
THE SYSTEM'S MEMORY

25:02.800 --> 25:05.002
FOR YOUR TEST RESULTS.

25:05.002 --> 25:08.606
HOWEVER, SINCE YOUR SISTER
RECEIVED A PERFECT SCORE,

25:08.606 --> 25:10.574
WE ARE GOING TO PASS YOU

25:10.574 --> 25:13.577
AND ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR ROAD TEST.

25:15.646 --> 25:17.615
I MEAN, HOW DIFFERENT CAN YOU

25:17.615 --> 25:20.851
AND YOUR TWIN SISTER ACTUALLY BE?

25:20.851 --> 25:23.421
( laughs )

25:23.421 --> 25:26.123
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- WAIT A MINUTE, STAND BACK.

25:26.123 --> 25:27.892
DON'T CROWD ME. I'M A LIVING TIME BOMB

25:38.702 --> 25:40.738
- OKAY.
- HI.

25:44.842 --> 25:47.945
LAST NAME FIRST, FIRST NAME LAST.

25:47.945 --> 25:50.781

25:56.821 --> 25:58.756
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LONG,

25:58.756 --> 26:01.258
HARD LOOK AT THIS CUP OF COFFEE.

26:02.660 --> 26:04.428
I LOVE MY COFFEE.

26:04.428 --> 26:06.630
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE
THING I TRULY CHERISH

26:06.630 --> 26:08.899
ON THIS GODFORSAKEN
MUDBALL CALLED EARTH.

26:08.899 --> 26:10.401
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

26:10.401 --> 26:14.872
IS THAT MOST EXAMINERS USE A CLIPBOARD.

26:14.872 --> 26:17.174
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM.

26:17.174 --> 26:19.777
WHAT IDOBELIEVE IN IS MY CUP OF COFFEE.

26:19.777 --> 26:22.113
NOW THAT COFFEE'S HOT,
FILLED RIGHT TO THE BRIM.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.348
IF IT SPILLED ON ME, IT'S
PROBABLY BURN ME, HUH?

26:24.348 --> 26:25.850
- SPEAK UP, SON!
- YEAH, YEAH.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.152
- NOBODY LIKES TO GET BURNED, DO THEY?
- NO.

26:28.152 --> 26:30.821
SO IT'S REAL SIMPLE. YOU BURN ME

26:30.821 --> 26:32.523
YOU FAIL.

26:32.523 --> 26:34.725
YOU DON'T, YOU PASS.

26:34.725 --> 26:36.093
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

26:51.542 --> 26:53.644
Examiner £1: ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON.

26:53.644 --> 26:56.514
LET'S START OFF WITH SOME LIGHT TRAFFIC.

26:56.514 --> 26:59.717
-( honking )

27:06.390 --> 27:08.893
NOW I WANT YOU TO GET OVER IN THAT LANE.

27:20.571 --> 27:23.040

27:48.232 --> 27:51.302
EVERY TIME I COME UP THIS
ROAD THERE'S SOME IDIOT KID.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.338
-COME ON, YOU MORON!
-WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, CHRISTMAS?

27:54.338 --> 27:57.575
OUGHT TO HAVE A TRUCK
TO GET THAT THING MOVING.

28:03.681 --> 28:05.349
HA HA!

28:05.349 --> 28:09.019
OKAY, NATALIE, I'D LIKE YOU TO

YOU'RE IN LUCK, ANDERSON.

29:17.888 --> 29:19.423
THE CUP...

29:19.423 --> 29:21.792
WAS EMPTY. ( laughs )

WELL, MR. ANDERSON,

30:07.204 --> 30:09.206

ALREADY KNOW YOU FAILED.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.182
GOD GIVETH

SO TELL ME, WAS IT MURDER? WAS IT TOUGH?

32:17.735 --> 32:20.805
NOT AT ALL, DAD. IT WAS LIKE
TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.406
GREAT. LOOK,

32:22.406 --> 32:24.975
I FILLED YOUR MOM'S CAR UP WITH SOME GAS

32:24.975 --> 32:28.245
JUST IN CASE YOU FELT LIKE
TAKING IT FOR A LITTLE SPIN.

32:28.245 --> 32:30.681
- Mrs. Anderson: HOW SWEET.
- WELL, DAD.

32:30.681 --> 32:33.918
I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO MY ROOM AND TAKING A LITTLE NAP.

32:33.918 --> 32:36.387
- I'M EXHAUSTED.
- HONEY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

32:36.387 --> 32:39.423
- SAY "AH!"
- MOM, COME ON, WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH ME?

32:39.423 --> 32:41.559
- IT'S THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE!
- I KNOW.

32:41.559 --> 32:44.328
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR FATHER'S SENILITY

32:44.328 --> 32:47.398
- AND TAKE MY CAR FOR A SPIN?
- GO AHEAD.

32:47.398 --> 32:50.034
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
GUYS REMEMBER OR NOT,

32:50.034 --> 32:52.737
BUT 16 YEARS OF WAITING AND DREAMING

32:52.737 --> 32:55.139
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. AND I'M NOT SURE

32:55.139 --> 32:57.174
THAT BEING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR

32:57.174 --> 32:59.176
IS THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR ME TO BE RIGHT NOW.

32:59.176 --> 33:01.312
( rings )

33:03.314 --> 33:06.417
- HELLO?
-( cheering )

33:06.417 --> 33:09.253
DID YOU HEAR THAT? YOU DID
IT, MAN. HOW DOES IT FEEL?

33:09.253 --> 33:11.088
Les: Dean, What's going on?

33:11.088 --> 33:14.625
HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M
LOOKING FOR MY CAR KEYS.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.194
FOUND THEM RIGHT HERE,
NEXT TO MY A.A.A. CARD.

33:17.194 --> 33:19.296
GREAT. NOW COME OVER AND PICK US UP.

33:20.598 --> 33:23.367
- UH, I CAN'T.
-Of course, you can.

33:23.367 --> 33:25.936
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,
LES. YOU HAVE A LICENSE.

33:25.936 --> 33:28.072
WHAT? SEE THAT, DEAN, MY MOM'S CALLING.

33:28.072 --> 33:31.375
THEY'RE ALREADY ASKING ME TO RUN
ERRANDS. I HAVE TO GO. GOODBYE!

33:33.010 --> 33:35.846
( humming )

33:48.893 --> 33:50.928
"TEST FAILED"?

33:51.996 --> 33:54.231
UH-OH.
UH-OH.

33:54.231 --> 33:55.800
ROBERT!

33:55.800 --> 33:57.635
## Trouble ##

33:57.635 --> 33:59.203
## Trouble ##

33:59.203 --> 34:02.339
ALL RIGHT, MERCEDES! HA-HA. YEAH!

34:02.339 --> 34:04.442
WELL, YOU KNOW--
LOWER IT, IT'S RINGING.

34:04.442 --> 34:06.143
COME HERE.

34:06.143 --> 34:09.980
- ( rings )
- HELLO?

34:09.980 --> 34:12.516
RUDY, MOM'S GOT BROWNIES IN THE KITCHEN.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.452
- GO! HURRY,
QUICK! - BUT--

34:14.452 --> 34:17.487
- DAD, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
- LES, MY BOY.

34:17.487 --> 34:21.025
WE'RE DRINKING A TOAST TO YOU.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.627
Mercedes: Hello? Hello?

34:23.627 --> 34:25.161
Hello?!

34:26.530 --> 34:29.433
DAD, THAT'S REALLY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU,

34:29.433 --> 34:31.702
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING AND DRIVING.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.871
I KNOW THAT, LES. I KNOW THAT.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.406
- HAVE A
DRINK. - BUT I--

34:35.406 --> 34:38.943
YOU JUST SAVED ME $26,000.

34:38.943 --> 34:41.746
- WHAT?
- FIRST RAISE YOUR GLASS

34:43.013 --> 34:46.150
TO SAVING ME 26,000 BUCKARONIS.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.284
HOW DID I DO THAT, DAD?

34:48.284 --> 34:50.855
SIMPLE. 23,000 FOR THE BMW,

34:50.855 --> 34:52.790
3,000 FOR THE INSURANCE.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.925
- I DON'T GET IT.
-NO?

34:54.925 --> 34:56.994
-NO.
- GET IT?

34:59.296 --> 35:00.931
Both: HE FAILED?

35:00.931 --> 35:03.734
HE FAILED AND HE LIED.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.371
LOOK, DAD,

35:07.371 --> 35:09.473
I FIGURED THAT I CAN
GET THROUGH THE WEEKEND

35:09.473 --> 35:11.308
AND THEN TAKE IT OVER MONDAY, YOU KNOW?

35:11.308 --> 35:13.611
I KNOW WHAT YOU FIGURED.

35:13.611 --> 35:17.748
LISTEN, YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR TWO WEEKS.

35:17.748 --> 35:20.184
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

35:20.184 --> 35:22.119
- FEELS LIKE IT.
-( doorbell rings )

35:27.091 --> 35:30.494
-GOOD EVENING, KARL.
- GOOD EVENING, MRS. ANDERSON.

35:30.494 --> 35:33.931
- IS NATASHA AT HOME?
- SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A SECOND.

35:33.931 --> 35:36.834
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- FINE. FINE.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.036
- FINE, THANK YOU.
- I ADMIRE YOU.

35:39.036 --> 35:42.373
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

35:42.373 --> 35:44.742
TO BRING A CHILD INTO
THIS OPPRESSIVE WORLD.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.844
- AND LET ME JUST-- -
( screaming )NATALIE!

35:49.880 --> 35:53.117
NATASHA, WE'RE GOING TO A PROTEST.

35:53.117 --> 35:55.119
DO WE HAVE TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER'S

35:55.119 --> 35:57.188
IMPERIALIST GAS GUZZLER?

35:57.188 --> 36:00.191
WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC?

36:09.900 --> 36:11.836
( sighs )

36:43.768 --> 36:46.537
( rings )

36:49.673 --> 36:52.443
- HELLO?
- HI, IS LES IN, PLEASE?

36:52.443 --> 36:55.913
- YEAH, THIS IS LES.
- HI, THIS IS MERCEDES.

36:55.913 --> 36:58.449
Do you remember me?

36:58.449 --> 37:01.118
REMEMBER YOU? YES, OF
COURSE. HI, HOW ARE YOU?

37:01.118 --> 37:03.354
ACTUALLY, I'M A LITTLE LONELY.

37:03.354 --> 37:06.357
I thought that we had a date tonight,

37:06.357 --> 37:09.126
AND I FIGURED I'D CALL YOU
SINCE YOU HADN'T CALLED ME.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.262
OH, UM,
WELL, I--

37:11.262 --> 37:15.299
I WAS OUT ALL DAY. I
WAS DEEP-SEA FISHING.

37:15.299 --> 37:18.803
SO YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED YOUR
MIND ABOUT TONIGHT, HAVE YOU?

37:18.803 --> 37:20.871
TONIGHT? NOW?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.708
- NO.
-Great.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.910
SO YOU CAN PICK ME UP IN 20 MINUTES?

37:29.613 --> 37:31.882
- LES?
-Hang on.

37:51.168 --> 37:53.637
AN INNOCENT GIRL,

37:53.637 --> 37:55.906
A HARMLESS DRIVE.

37:55.906 --> 37:58.509
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.282
MERCEDES?

38:05.282 --> 38:07.118
I'LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.638
( groaning )

38:46.357 --> 38:47.758
OH MAN!

38:47.758 --> 38:50.494
NO! NO! NO!

38:52.930 --> 38:55.533
NO, NOT THE BUSHES!

39:04.675 --> 39:07.378
( snores )

39:13.484 --> 39:15.019
GOD!

39:19.757 --> 39:21.992
OH! AH!

39:21.992 --> 39:23.694
- SH-- -(
bulb breaks )

39:33.804 --> 39:35.740
( engine starts )

39:48.152 --> 39:50.721
( gasps )

39:52.123 --> 39:54.759
OW! OW!

39:58.529 --> 40:01.532
HMM. HMM?

40:07.705 --> 40:11.442
DON'T WORRY, IT WAS
NOTHING. GO BACK TO SLEEP.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.544
MMM... THAT'S NICE.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.291
( doorbell rings )

40:38.402 --> 40:39.937
LET'S GO.

40:47.845 --> 40:51.282
Radio: ## 'Cause you spell trouble ##

40:51.282 --> 40:53.617
## Trouble ##

40:53.617 --> 40:57.054
## I tried to please you,
but I'm wasting my time ##

40:57.054 --> 40:58.656
## You're nothing but trouble ##

40:58.656 --> 41:00.758
## Trouble ##

41:00.758 --> 41:03.527
## Trouble, baby ##

41:06.063 --> 41:07.965
## Trouble. ##

41:19.577 --> 41:22.279
- Woman: THANK YOU.
- TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, PAL.

41:22.279 --> 41:24.048
YES, SIR. ( laughs )

41:24.048 --> 41:25.816
( tires screech )

41:30.388 --> 41:32.390
-( loud crash )
-( tapping on glass )

41:32.390 --> 41:33.858
COME ON, MAN, OPEN UP!

41:33.858 --> 41:36.227
-LET'S GO!
- OPEN THE DOOR, LES.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.696
DID YOU SEE THAT? IF
I LET HIM PARK MY CAR

41:38.696 --> 41:40.431
HE'LL RUIN MY TRANSMISSION. NO WAY!

41:43.034 --> 41:45.036
HEY, WHAT ABOUT MY TIP?

41:49.907 --> 41:51.642
HERE WE ARE.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.446
WAIT, WE CAN'T PARK HERE.
IT'S A TOW-AWAY ZONE.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.681
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?

41:57.681 --> 42:00.885
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S THE
FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.934
( club music playing )

42:16.934 --> 42:19.236
- HEY, BABY.
- HI.

42:19.236 --> 42:21.706
- WHOA, WHOA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M WITH HER.

42:23.274 --> 42:26.410
YOU WOULDN'T BE WITH HER IF
SHE WAS YOUR SIAMESE TWIN!

42:26.410 --> 42:28.646
- LOSE YOURSELF, KID.
- MERCEDES!

42:32.116 --> 42:34.185
HI!

42:34.185 --> 42:37.088
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.363
DAMN IT!

42:47.565 --> 42:50.501
- PAOLO?
- MERCEDES.

42:50.501 --> 42:52.670
WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE IT IS TO SEE YOU.

42:52.670 --> 42:56.340
- I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
- BY THE WAY, THIS IS VERONIQUE.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.743
SHE'S GOING TO BE MOVING IN WITH ME.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.545
IS THIS THE ONE YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?

43:02.747 --> 43:04.682
WOULD YOU LIKE A
DRINK? GIVE HER A DRINK.

43:04.682 --> 43:07.385
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
- NOTHING.

43:15.659 --> 43:18.963
MERCEDES! HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

43:20.664 --> 43:24.035
OH MY GOD. MY CAR!

43:26.504 --> 43:28.639
WHOA! JESUS!

43:29.874 --> 43:33.544
WAIT, WAIT! WAIT! HOLD UP!

43:33.544 --> 43:35.379
GET OFF MY TRUCK, BOY!

43:35.379 --> 43:39.150
LOOK, MISTER, YOU
CAN'T DO THIS TO MY CAR!

43:39.150 --> 43:41.152
BOY, I'VE DRIVEN WITH DEER, ANTELOPE,

43:41.152 --> 43:43.154
EVEN BEARS STRAPPED TO THAT BUMPER.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.156
AIN'T NO 65-LB. SACK OF FLYSHIT

43:45.156 --> 43:47.291
LIKE YOU GONNA SHAKE
ME A HELL A DIFFERENCE.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.393
I'LL PAY YOU. I'LL GIVE
YOU EVERYTHING I GOT!

43:50.594 --> 43:52.630
- ( tires screech )
- AAH!

43:57.034 --> 43:59.637
JUST HOW MUCH YOU TALKING ABOUT?

44:04.308 --> 44:06.644
- PLEASE, SIR, BE GENTLE.
- ( laughs )

44:08.079 --> 44:10.848
FOR 80 BUCKS?!

44:10.848 --> 44:12.450
( laughs louder )

44:15.886 --> 44:18.322
80 BUCKS!

44:28.332 --> 44:30.334
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHAMPAGNE?

44:30.334 --> 44:32.737
- IT MIGHT HELP.
- NO, THANKS.

44:32.737 --> 44:34.739
I ALREADY HAD SOME TONIGHT.

44:36.207 --> 44:39.243
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE CAR.

44:39.243 --> 44:42.246
- I FEEL LIKE IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.
- DON'T BE SILLY.

44:42.246 --> 44:45.483
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CAR TO
THE VALET IN THE FIRST PLACE.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.885
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

44:47.885 --> 44:51.122
HE WAS A JERK ANYWAYS. I DON'T
KNOW WHY I EVEN HUNG AROUND HIM.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.827
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- AND GO WHERE?

44:56.827 --> 44:59.063
WITH THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY I HAVE IN MY POCKET

44:59.063 --> 45:01.198
WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.

45:01.198 --> 45:04.602
WE CAN EITHER SIT IN FRONT A
PARKING METER FOR 20 MINUTES,

45:04.602 --> 45:07.004
OR GO BUY OURSELVES A NEWSPAPER.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.843
LET ME TELL YOU. I KNOW A QUIET SPOT

45:12.843 --> 45:15.112
WITH PLENTY OF FREE PARKING.

45:21.018 --> 45:23.621
( shocks creaking )

45:24.689 --> 45:27.024
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S A ROAD HERE?

45:28.693 --> 45:30.594
THANK GOD.

45:51.816 --> 45:55.019
HEY, IT'S AMAZING UP HERE.

45:55.019 --> 45:57.621
HOW DID YOU EVER FIND THIS PLACE?

45:57.621 --> 46:00.491
SOMEONE I KNOW USED TO TAKE ME HERE.

46:02.927 --> 46:05.062
NOT A BOYFRIEND.

46:05.062 --> 46:07.164
MY FATHER USED TO TAKE ME HERE

46:07.164 --> 46:10.201
TO SHOW ME HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE WORLD COULD BE

46:10.201 --> 46:12.636
IF YOU COULD STEP AWAY
AND SEE IT AT A DISTANCE.

46:16.741 --> 46:19.710
- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A LONG TIME.
- NO, NO, NO.

46:19.710 --> 46:22.313
NOT ON THE CAR. I MEAN,
I'LL GET YOU A BLANKET.

46:24.348 --> 46:27.385
- YOU SURE COME PREPARED.
- LIKE A BOY SCOUT.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.587
-LES?
- YES?

46:29.587 --> 46:31.889
I'M SORRY I DRAGGED YOU INTO ALL THIS.

46:33.657 --> 46:36.293
- I DON'T USUALLY ACT LIKE THIS.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

46:36.293 --> 46:37.828
I DON'T MIND.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.533
HERE YOU GO.

46:46.070 --> 46:49.640
- I'M REALLY GLAD I CALLED YOU TONIGHT.
- YEAH?

46:49.640 --> 46:53.010
I'M-- I'M
REALLY GLAD TOO.

46:54.578 --> 46:57.348
ALL WE'RE MISSING NOW IS
SOME SOFT ROMANTIC MUSIC.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.483
HOLD ON.

47:06.757 --> 47:09.160
-( soft music plays )
-( music stops )

47:13.664 --> 47:15.833
OH MAN.

47:21.939 --> 47:24.408
OH GREAT. GRANDPA'S TOP 10!

47:33.050 --> 47:36.620
-( soft music plays )
- ( groans )

47:41.392 --> 47:44.362
WAIT-- AREN'T YOU
DRINKING RATHER HEAVILY?

47:44.362 --> 47:46.797
## Strangers in the night ##

47:46.797 --> 47:49.600
-## Exchanging glances... ##
- DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

47:49.600 --> 47:51.836
-## Wandering in the night... ##
- TO THIS?

47:51.836 --> 47:53.804
- UH, YEAH. WHERE?
- RIGHT UP HERE.

47:53.804 --> 47:56.574
YOU COULDN'T PRAY FOR
A MORE ROMANTIC SETTING.

47:58.409 --> 48:01.278
- ( metallic scraping )
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

48:05.282 --> 48:08.686
## Something in your eyes ##

48:08.686 --> 48:11.088
## Was so inviting ##

48:11.088 --> 48:13.591
## Something in your smile ##

48:13.591 --> 48:16.327
## Was so exciting... ##

48:17.895 --> 48:20.765
- MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE MY SHOES OFF.
- YEAH.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.600
GOOD IDEA.

48:26.771 --> 48:30.174
## Strangers in the night ##

48:30.174 --> 48:32.209
## Two lonely people ##

48:32.209 --> 48:35.446
## We were strangers in the night ##

48:35.446 --> 48:37.448
## Up to the moment ##

48:37.448 --> 48:40.251
## When we said our first hello ##

48:40.251 --> 48:43.087
## Little did we know ##

48:43.087 --> 48:45.523
## Love was just a glance away ##

48:45.523 --> 48:48.926
## A warm, embracing dance away... ##

48:48.926 --> 48:50.461
( hood creaking )

48:50.461 --> 48:52.630
GET UP! GET OFF! GET OFF THE CAR!

48:52.630 --> 48:56.067
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, LES?
- THE HOOD, IT'S CAVING IN. GET OFF QUICK!

48:56.067 --> 48:57.802
LITTLE LES, I LOVE THIS SONG.

48:57.802 --> 49:00.705
THEN YOU DEFINITELY HAD TOO
MUCH TO DRINK. COME ON, GET OFF.

49:00.705 --> 49:03.541
( giggling )

49:03.541 --> 49:05.609
OH WOW! STAY HERE.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.348
( Mercedes giggling )

49:10.348 --> 49:12.350
( laughing )

49:13.918 --> 49:15.853
COME ON, GET IN.

49:15.853 --> 49:17.455
- OH!
- SHH.

49:17.455 --> 49:20.558
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS
THING FIXED. SLIDE OVER.

49:20.558 --> 49:22.993
( engine stalling )

49:22.993 --> 49:25.463
MERCEDES, PLEASE.

49:26.797 --> 49:31.068
YOU HAVE SUCH BABY-SOFT SKIN.

49:35.172 --> 49:37.208
## Ever since that night ##

49:37.208 --> 49:39.577
## We've been together... ##

49:39.577 --> 49:41.579
( snoring )

49:46.050 --> 49:49.687
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE NOISE,
MAN. MY PARENTS ARE VAMPIRES.

49:49.687 --> 49:52.390
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING. YOU HAVE BALLS.

49:52.390 --> 49:55.960
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE BALLS
FOR SNAGGING THIS CAR.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.862
I'M IMPRESSED.

49:57.862 --> 50:00.431
ALL RIGHT, LES. LET'S SEE THE LICENSE.

50:00.431 --> 50:02.767
NO WAY. FORGET IT, GUYS. IT'S UGLY.

50:02.767 --> 50:05.369
OF COURSE IT IS. BIG DEAL.

50:05.369 --> 50:07.371
- Charles: COME ON, LES.
- NO WAY!

50:07.371 --> 50:09.306
- LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT.
-FORGET IT.

50:09.306 --> 50:11.575
DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD
LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT?

50:11.575 --> 50:13.844
- OKAY. CHARLES, OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.313
- SAY "CHEESE"!
- CHEESE.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.483
GREAT.

50:21.519 --> 50:24.989
WELL, TAKE A LOOK,
LES. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50:24.989 --> 50:27.258
- EXCELLENT WORK, DEAN.
- THANKS.

50:27.258 --> 50:29.260
THIS IS SPECTACULAR!

50:29.260 --> 50:31.062
YOU SAVED ME, MAN. THANKS.

50:33.798 --> 50:37.001
SO, I GUESS WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES NOW?

50:37.001 --> 50:39.336
LOOK, DEANO, PAL, I PROMISE YOU,

50:39.336 --> 50:41.338
NEXT WEEKEND, YEAH, FINE, OKAY.

50:41.338 --> 50:43.107
WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES. BUT NOT TONIGHT.

50:43.107 --> 50:45.543
MERCEDES DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE HOME FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

50:45.543 --> 50:48.079
LES, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.

50:48.079 --> 50:50.381
UNLESS YOU'RE INTO SOME
INTENSE KINKY SHIT--

50:50.381 --> 50:52.149
AND YOU NEVER KNOW AFTER TONIGHT,

50:52.149 --> 50:54.819
THIS MERCEDES HAS A DEAD BATTERY.

50:56.420 --> 51:00.558
LES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ARCHIES ATOMIC HERE.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.460
YOU CAN'T GET THERE WITHOUT A LICENSE.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.195
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

51:04.195 --> 51:05.830
NO BUSSES, NO TRAINS, NO PLANES.

51:05.830 --> 51:08.265
ONLY THE SLICKEST, MOST
INTENSE DRIVING MACHINES

51:08.265 --> 51:10.401
YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.

51:10.401 --> 51:14.138
I HAVE THE DIRECTIONS MY BROTHER
GAVE ME IN MY BACK POCKET.

51:14.138 --> 51:17.041
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS. THERE'S
FIVE GIRLS FOR EVERY GUY.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.510
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING
DOGS, WE'RE TALKING BUNNIES.

51:19.510 --> 51:21.445
DEAN, DID YOU WIPE YOUR FEET OFF?

51:21.445 --> 51:23.647
YES, I WIPED THE CONCRETE OFF MY FEET.

51:23.647 --> 51:25.316
HEY, CHARLES, PUSH IN THE LIGHTER.

51:25.316 --> 51:28.185
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR EVERYBODY.

51:28.185 --> 51:30.554
NO WAY. NOT IN HERE. HUH-UH.

51:30.554 --> 51:32.890
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
YOU, LES? THIS IS A CAR,

51:32.890 --> 51:34.558
IT'S NOT AN OXYGEN TENT.

51:34.558 --> 51:37.361
DEAN, IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE
AT ALL THAT I TOOK THIS CAR

51:37.361 --> 51:40.731
MY DAD'S GONNA SLAUGHTER ME FIRST
AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER, OKAY?

51:40.731 --> 51:43.634
- STOP IT!
- ( cars honking )

51:53.577 --> 51:57.515
- ( sweeper honking )
- HEY, LES, THIS IS GREAT AND ALL,

51:57.515 --> 51:59.483
BUT COULD TAKE THE CAR OUT OF NEUTRAL?

51:59.483 --> 52:01.585
WE JUST GOT PASSED BY A STREET-SWEEPER.

52:04.722 --> 52:07.058
( honks )

52:07.058 --> 52:09.460
( loud heavy metal music playing )

52:09.460 --> 52:12.363
Man: HEY, GIRLS, WHOSE
CAR YOU DRIVING, GRANDMA'S?

52:12.363 --> 52:14.532
COME ON, RACE HIM.

52:14.532 --> 52:16.233
LET'S MESS WITH THE FAGGOTS, MAN.

52:18.569 --> 52:20.671
WAIT,
GET THAT--

52:23.874 --> 52:25.810
( engine revving )

52:33.317 --> 52:34.752
GO!

52:37.388 --> 52:40.558
Dean: LES, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

52:40.558 --> 52:42.593
ARE YOU 16 OR 60?

52:42.593 --> 52:45.563
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THOSE
GEARHEADS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

52:45.563 --> 52:47.331
DEAN THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER'S CAR.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.934
GIVE ME A CAR THAT I'M
NOT GENETICALLY RELATED TO,

52:49.934 --> 52:51.702
I PROMISE THINGS WILL CHANGE, OKAY?

52:51.702 --> 52:55.439
- HONEY.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

52:55.439 --> 52:57.641
OKAY, I'M COUNTING. DO YOUR BREATHING.

52:57.641 --> 53:00.111
( breathing quickly ) OKAY.

53:00.111 --> 53:02.780
IS IT HOT IN HERE?

53:02.780 --> 53:04.582
IS IT HOT OR IS IT JUST ME?

53:04.582 --> 53:08.853
- IT'S HOT?
- IT'S LIKE A SAUNA IN HERE.

53:08.853 --> 53:12.156
WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THE GARAGE
AND TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING?

53:12.156 --> 53:15.860
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I LIKE
TO JUST SIT HERE AND SWEAT.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.795
I'LL TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.643
( moans )

53:49.026 --> 53:51.328
Mrs. Anderson on intercom: Hey, Robert?

53:51.328 --> 53:52.997
Robert?!

53:54.598 --> 53:58.069
- YES?
- I'M NOT HOT ANYMORE. I'M HUNGRY.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.938
Will you make me a sandwich, please?

54:00.938 --> 54:03.974
- OKAY, HONEY.
-Sardines and pickles, okay?

54:03.974 --> 54:05.209
( groans )

54:08.045 --> 54:10.247
( cars honking )

54:12.983 --> 54:15.486
## Saturday night is
the loneliest night ##

54:15.486 --> 54:18.022
## Of the week ##

54:18.022 --> 54:21.926
## 'Cause that's the night
that my sweetie and I ##

54:21.926 --> 54:24.829
## Used to dance cheek to cheek ##

54:24.829 --> 54:28.999
## I don't mind Sunday night at all ##

54:28.999 --> 54:33.237
## 'Cause that's the night
friends come to call ##

54:33.237 --> 54:36.707
## And Monday through Friday's a gas ##

54:36.707 --> 54:40.378
## And another week goes past ##

54:40.378 --> 54:42.380
## But Saturday night ##

54:42.380 --> 54:46.050
## Is the loneliest night of the week ##

54:46.050 --> 54:48.352
## I sing the song ##

54:48.352 --> 54:50.621
## That I sang for the memories... ##

54:50.621 --> 54:52.857
- YOU ASSHOLE, DO UP HER SHIRT.
- NO WAY.

54:52.857 --> 54:55.059
FORGET ABOUT IT. I MEAN, LOOK AT US.

54:55.059 --> 54:57.495
WE'RE THREE WILD ANIMALS
BOMBING DOWN THE HIGHWAY

54:57.495 --> 54:59.330
WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET TO 55 M.P.H.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.499
I DON'T NEED A TICKET
ON MY FIRST NIGHT OUT.

55:01.499 --> 55:03.734
GOD DAMN IT, STOP THAT!

55:03.734 --> 55:05.836
WHAT IS THIS CRAP WE'RE LISTENING TO?

55:05.836 --> 55:08.139
MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO THIS!

55:10.408 --> 55:12.843
- GIVE ME THAT CAMERA!
- NO!

55:12.843 --> 55:15.880
GOD DAMN IT, DEAN, IT'S NOT YOUR CAMERA.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.382
- GIVE ME THE CAMERA. GIVE ME IT!
- NO! NO!

55:18.382 --> 55:19.884
- GIVE ME IT!
- NO!

55:19.884 --> 55:22.653
- JESUS!
- WATCH OUT!

55:30.594 --> 55:32.663
OH, WE'RE GONNA DIE!

55:32.663 --> 55:35.933
-I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
- SHIT!

55:47.244 --> 55:50.214
- Charles: LES,
STOP THE CAR! -UH-OH.

55:50.214 --> 55:52.283
( all scream )

56:12.870 --> 56:15.473
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

56:15.473 --> 56:18.042
( screams )

56:18.042 --> 56:20.678
- GET HER OUT OF THE CAR, QUICK!
- HELP! HELP!

56:20.678 --> 56:23.014
HELP! GET HER OFF OF ME!

56:23.014 --> 56:24.982
- NOT IN THE CAR, PLEASE!
- I'M TRAPPED!

56:29.253 --> 56:30.788
( screams )

56:30.788 --> 56:33.024
LES, I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING,

56:33.024 --> 56:35.693
BUT THAT RIDE WAS DEFINITELY
WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.

56:35.693 --> 56:37.995
THAT MAKES UP FOR A
WHOLE LIFE OF BOREDOM.

56:37.995 --> 56:39.663
THERE'S A SCRATCH ON MY CAR.

56:41.298 --> 56:43.034
WHERE?

56:43.034 --> 56:45.936
RIGHT THERE. RIGHT HERE,
THERE'S A BIG OLD SCRATCH.

56:45.936 --> 56:48.739
-HOLD ON, LET ME SEE.
- MY DAD'LL MURDER ME. LOOK AT THIS!

56:48.739 --> 56:51.342
-THERE IS NO SCRATCH.
-THERE IS A SCRATCH HERE.

56:51.342 --> 56:54.412
A TINY LITTLE SCRATCH. YOUR DAD
IS NOT GOING TO SEE THAT SCRATCH.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.747
YOUR DAD'S A 40-YEAR-OLD
GUY WHO WEARS GLASSES.

56:56.747 --> 56:59.550
NOT AN EAGLE, OKAY? NOW LISTEN TO ME.

56:59.550 --> 57:02.553
WE ARE TWO SECONDS AWAY FROM
ARCHIES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

57:02.553 --> 57:05.656
YOU LISTEN TO ME. TWO
SECONDS OR NOT TWO SECONDS.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.992
WATCH MY LIPS. WE'RE
NOT GOING TO ARCHIES.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.795
WE'RE NOT DRIVING IN MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC ANYMORE.

57:10.795 --> 57:13.030
WE ARE IN FACT GOING HOME, OKAY?

57:13.030 --> 57:16.200
- Dean: NO, IT'S NOT OKAY!
- YOU DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

57:16.200 --> 57:19.804
- ( Mercedes moans )
- Dean: WE CANNOT TURN AROUND NOW.

57:19.804 --> 57:21.472
WE'D BETTER GET YOU A SODA.

57:22.973 --> 57:25.509
YOU HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD

57:25.509 --> 57:27.712
FOR THAT LICENSE IN YOUR WALLET.

57:27.712 --> 57:31.315
YOU'VE HAD 16 YEARS OF HUMILIATION,

57:31.315 --> 57:33.317
BEGGING FOR LIFTS FROM PEOPLE

57:33.317 --> 57:35.353
WHO COULDN'T GIVE A
SHIT ABOUT YOUR IMAGE.

57:35.353 --> 57:38.022
LES, YOU'VE HAD TO STAND AND WATCH

57:38.022 --> 57:41.258
AS ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS DROVE
OFF IN SOME OLDER JERK'S CAR.

57:41.258 --> 57:43.527
HUMILIATION-- I KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT!

57:43.527 --> 57:45.329
BUT THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.

57:45.329 --> 57:48.933
LES, THAT THING IN YOUR WALLET,

57:48.933 --> 57:51.068
THAT'S NO ORDINARY PIECE OF PAPER.

57:51.068 --> 57:52.903
THAT IS A DRIVER'S LICENSE!

57:52.903 --> 57:55.172
IT IS NOT ONLY A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

57:55.172 --> 57:57.141
IT'S AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE!

57:57.141 --> 57:59.110
AND IT'S NOT ONLY AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE,

57:59.110 --> 58:01.012
IT IS A LICENSE TO LIVE,

58:01.012 --> 58:05.282
A LICENSE TO BE FREE,
TO GO WHEREVER, WHENEVER,

58:05.282 --> 58:07.618
AND WITH WHOMEVER YOU CHOOSE.

58:07.618 --> 58:10.287
( player piano playing )

58:19.430 --> 58:21.899
ARCHIES, MAN. LET'S DO IT.

58:21.899 --> 58:24.535
- DEANO, I DON'T KNOW.
- LES,

58:24.535 --> 58:26.637
TO LIVE IN FEAR

58:26.637 --> 58:29.173
IS NOT TO LIVE AT ALL.

58:34.178 --> 58:36.013
WHAT ABOUT MERCEDES?

58:37.682 --> 58:39.917
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

58:39.917 --> 58:41.585
OF COURSE IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

58:41.585 --> 58:44.021
IN HALF AN HOUR, THERE'S
GONNA BE BABES ALL OVER US.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.123
SHE'LL KILL IT FOR US.

58:50.327 --> 58:53.497
WOW, DID YOU EVER
IMAGINE IN ALL YOUR LIFE

58:53.497 --> 58:57.301
THAT YOU WOULD SEE A MERCEDES FIT
INSIDE THE TRUNK OF A CADILLAC?

58:57.301 --> 58:59.236
LOOK, I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.

58:59.236 --> 59:01.605
FEEL BAD? FOR HER?

59:01.605 --> 59:04.875
THIS TRUNK IS BIGGER THAN
THE SIZE OF MY BEDROOM.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.644
LET'S GO.

59:10.081 --> 59:11.882
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

59:16.987 --> 59:20.925
## CHILLS OVER ME ##

59:20.925 --> 59:23.894
## DIFFERENT FROM THE REST ##

59:23.894 --> 59:25.730
## I WON'T SETTLE FOR LESS ##

HEY, EYES FORWARD.

59:59.296 --> 01:00:00.965
Dean: LOOK AT HER!

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.903
HEY, COME BACK HERE.

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:08.172
## YOU KNOW YOU ARE MY LIFE, GIRL ##

## CRUCIAL LOVIN'... ##

WAIT UP FOR A SECOND. WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS GO GET SOME DINNER?

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:27.992
I'M GONNA GET DESSERT.
ALL RIGHT? GO, GO.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.028
HI!

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:34.265
## LOVE IS ON THE RISE ##

01:00:34.265 --> 01:00:37.168
## DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE ##

01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:40.571
## I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE ##

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:42.973
## I CAN CALL MY OWN ##

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.776
## NOT JUST ANYONE ##

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.879
## OH NO... ##

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.816
- HERE YOU GO.
- Charles: THANK YOU.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.653
GUYS, IT'S ALL SET UP.

01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:57.621
I TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.191
THEY'LL BE HERE IN A FEW
MINUTES-- ONE FOR EACH OF US.

01:01:00.191 --> 01:01:02.460
DEAN, I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.962
- I KNOW YOU WON'T!
- MY DREAMS NEVER GET THIS GOOD.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:07.031
MY FANTASIES NEVER GET THIS GOOD!

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:09.500
AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.968
- WHOO!
- WHOA!

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.603
Les: YEAH, LET'S EAT!

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.547
SORRY.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.651
- QUICK, ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
- THOSE ASSHOLES AGAIN.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.989
CHARLES, YOU SPASTICATED IDIOT!

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:35.726
Charles: IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:38.029
HEY, MY HAMBURGER!

01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:40.264
GIVE ME MY HAMBURGER. OW! OW!

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:43.034
- Dean: ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN.
- Charles: NO, KEEP IT UP!

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:45.036
-ROLL IT DOWN!
-NO, KEEP IT UP!

01:01:45.036 --> 01:01:47.271
-( engine stalling )
- HEY, COME HERE!

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:51.275
- HI!
- GOD DAMN IT!

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:53.110
( engine starts )

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:56.313
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW. WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
- THEY'RE MANIACS.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.369
Dean: ARCHIES, COME BACK!

01:02:18.369 --> 01:02:20.705
COME BACK!

01:02:20.705 --> 01:02:23.040
COME BACK!

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:28.446
Anchorwoman: I'm standing outside
the gates of Allied Technologies

01:02:28.446 --> 01:02:31.949
where a group of peaceful protesters
are gathered to demonstrate against

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:35.286
the late-night transportation of
military hardware through our streets.

01:02:35.286 --> 01:02:38.589
NOW, JIM, AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S
A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE HERE

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.758
- ALL SINGING AND CHANTING...
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:43.127
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH
A GOOD IDEA. CAN WE GO HOME?

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:45.696
LOOK, DEAN, WE'RE GOING
HOME. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT

01:02:45.696 --> 01:02:48.699
YOU CAN JUMP OUT RIGHT HERE--
WHEREVER THE HELL WE ARE.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.873
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE MY MOM'S AUDI.

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:09.653
HOLY SHIT! I THINK WE'RE BEING INVADED!

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:13.057
- ( sirens blaring )
- HERE THEY COME!

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.229
COME ON!

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:24.535
HEY! NO, NO, NOT ON MY
CAR! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:28.472
MY CAR! MY CAR!

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.107
HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY!

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.710
HE LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND!

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:35.546
- LES?
- SHIT, MY SISTER! DUCK!

01:03:35.546 --> 01:03:38.616
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD.

01:03:38.616 --> 01:03:40.685
- I BEG YOU!
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE!

01:03:40.685 --> 01:03:42.319
NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD!

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.922
P.A.: All right, let's
round these people up.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.824
Cuff them and put them in the wagon.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.926
EXCUSE ME!

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:51.562
SHIT.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.698
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME,

01:03:53.698 --> 01:03:55.466
WHAT STARTED AS A PEACEFUL PROTEST

01:03:55.466 --> 01:03:58.469
has now mushroomed into a
substantial demonstration.

01:03:58.469 --> 01:04:00.838
It seems that tempers
flared when executives

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:03.607
from Allied Technologies
refused to speak to rep--

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.576
( snores )

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:09.613
- Dean: OH MY GOD!
- Les: WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THERE?

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:12.950
Dean: I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS CADDY SURE CAN TAKE A BEATING.

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.353
Les: NOT HALF THE BEATING YOU'LL GET

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:17.188
UNLESS YOU CLAM UP, DEAN!

01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:25.930
OH THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS REAL CLASSIC.

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:28.366
Charles: THEY MUST BE
CHECKING FOR DRUNK DRIVERS.

01:04:28.366 --> 01:04:31.002
-YEAH, NO SHIT!
- DON'T SWEAT IT.

01:04:31.002 --> 01:04:32.870
THINK OF YOUR LICENSE AS A CREDIT CARD.

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:35.272
SOONER OR LATER, YOU'VE
GOT TO BREAK IT IN.

01:04:35.272 --> 01:04:37.575
PULL OVER ON THE CURB, RIGHT OVER THERE.

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:39.744
Dean: AND WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

01:04:39.744 --> 01:04:43.114
WE'RE SOBER. THEY'RE HERE TO
CATCH DRUNKS, LIKE THAT DICK.

01:04:43.114 --> 01:04:45.549
HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK TONIGHT, SIR?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:48.185
TAKE IT EASY.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:49.787
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.

01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:56.494
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, SON.

01:04:57.862 --> 01:04:59.930
UM, SIR,

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.832
I FORGOT MY LICENSE AT HOME.

01:05:01.832 --> 01:05:03.834
BUT UM,

01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:06.704
I COULD GIVE YOU THIS.

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:15.446
ALL RIGHT, SIT TIGHT.

01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:19.216
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM YOUR LICENSE?

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:22.253
WHAT WAS THAT THING YOU FLASHED
IN FRONT OF US AT THE HOUSE?

01:05:22.253 --> 01:05:23.954
MY SCHOOL I.D.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.890
ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT YOU LEFT THE HOUSE

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:29.794
ON YOUR FIRST NIGHT OUT WITH
A LICENSE WITHOUT A LICENSE?

01:05:29.794 --> 01:05:32.797
NO, DEAN, I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.

01:05:32.797 --> 01:05:34.999
LOOK, GUYS,

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:37.368
I FAILED MY EXAM.

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.203
Both: YOU WHAT?!

01:05:39.203 --> 01:05:42.973
- PROPER GRAMMAR IS-- - THIS
PUNK DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE.

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:45.276
ALL RIGHT, SIR, WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO

01:05:45.276 --> 01:05:47.912
IS TO TRY TO WALK THIS
LINE HERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:05:47.912 --> 01:05:49.680
- ALL RIGHT.
- PESKY, COME HERE.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.949
YOU JUST KEEP WALKING.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:54.585
WE HAVE TO CALL A WAGON
TO PICK THIS GUY UP.

01:05:54.585 --> 01:05:56.587
THIS IS GOING TO GO IN OUR RECORDS.

01:05:56.587 --> 01:05:59.824
WE'RE GONNA BE LOCKED UP IN A CELL
WITH MEN WHO'VE MURDERED AND RAPED

01:05:59.824 --> 01:06:01.592
AND ROBBED CONVENIENCE STORES!

01:06:01.592 --> 01:06:04.829
WILL YOU TAKE A PILL OR
SOMETHING? WILL YOU JUST RELAX?

01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:08.499
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO US. WE'RE JUVENILES.

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.536
NICE CALL, DEAN.

01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:15.206
ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON, LET'S
HAVE A LOOK INSIDE THE TRUNK.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:20.311
COME ON. I AIN'T GOT ALL NIGHT.

01:06:21.379 --> 01:06:22.980
COME ON! COME ON!

01:06:28.686 --> 01:06:30.688
HI, HOW YOU DOING?

01:06:30.688 --> 01:06:33.691
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

01:06:33.691 --> 01:06:36.027
MY DATE?

01:06:36.027 --> 01:06:38.329
( siren wails )

01:06:39.964 --> 01:06:43.134
WE GOT TO ROLL! THERE'S A
RIOT GOING ON AT ALLIED TECH!

01:06:44.235 --> 01:06:46.270
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY, PAL.

01:06:49.607 --> 01:06:51.442
LET'S GO.

01:06:51.442 --> 01:06:53.778
( siren wails )

01:06:53.778 --> 01:06:57.081
- Drunk: EXCUSE ME,
OFFICER-- - YES! PERFECT!

01:06:57.081 --> 01:06:59.417
SEE, LES, WHAT DID I
TELL YOU? PIECE OF CAKE!

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:01.585
SHUT UP, HUH? HELP ME WITH HER.

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:03.821
DO SOMETHING USEFUL IN LIFE, WOULD YOU?

01:07:04.889 --> 01:07:07.058
IT LOOKS LIKE A LINE. OH YEAH.

01:07:09.427 --> 01:07:12.330
OH, MASERATI.

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:15.966
OH, THIS IS MUCH NICER THAN MINE.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.668
KEYS?!

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:21.505
THIS CHICK IS NO PAPERWEIGHT.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:24.075
- SO WHERE'S OUR NEXT STOP?
- THERE ARE NO STOPS, DEAN.

01:07:24.075 --> 01:07:26.310
- WE'RE GOING HOME.
- ( engine starts )

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:35.553
OH, I'M DEAD.

01:07:35.553 --> 01:07:38.289
I'M SO DEAD THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BURY ME TWICE.

01:07:38.289 --> 01:07:41.292
LET'S GO.

01:07:41.292 --> 01:07:43.094
## Back on top in June... ##

01:07:43.094 --> 01:07:44.929
LOOKS LIKE I'M IN FOR THE NIGHT.

01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:46.797
## I said that's life... ##

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:50.234
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS CAR!
- HE TOOK OUR CAR. WE'LL TAKE HIS!

01:07:54.405 --> 01:07:58.743
-## But I don't let it get me down... ##
- WHAT A WASTE.

01:07:58.743 --> 01:08:00.778
NOW I'M SWINGING!

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.148
GO! GO!

01:08:04.148 --> 01:08:07.418
## I'VE BEEN A PUPPET,
A PAUPER, A PIRATE ##

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:11.255
## A POET, A PAWN AND A KING ##

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:14.625
## I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN
AND OVER AND OUT-- ##

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:17.495
WHERE THE HELL AM I?

01:08:17.495 --> 01:08:19.095
- HE'S GOING LEFT!
- I SEE HIM!

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.968
All: WHOA!

01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:33.109
- WHERE THE HELL'S THIS GUY GOING?
-## That's life... ##

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.679
YEAH, GO, SAMMY!

01:08:38.015 --> 01:08:39.684
OH! OH!

01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:43.821
- SHIT!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:45.723
I CAN FIX THAT. IT'S
ONLY THE RIGHT SIDE.

01:08:45.723 --> 01:08:49.393
## Each time I find myself ##

01:08:49.393 --> 01:08:52.296
-## Laying flat on my back... ##
- ( screams )

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:55.299
## I JUST PICK MYSELF UP ##

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:58.269
## AND GET BACK IN THE RACE ##

01:08:58.269 --> 01:08:59.670
## THAT'S LIFE! ##

01:09:06.477 --> 01:09:08.946
MY LIFE'S NO BED OF
ROSES, THAT'S FOR SURE.

01:09:08.946 --> 01:09:11.982
PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
PEOPLE PUSHING ME AROUND!

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:15.219
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY TO THE
GUY, JUST GET HIM TO PULL OVER!

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:18.856
THE MAN IS A DRUNK LUNATIC. DON'T
YOU THINK THIS IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS?

01:09:18.856 --> 01:09:21.993
YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT DANGEROUS?
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S DANGEROUS?

01:09:21.993 --> 01:09:24.261
ME GOING HOME AND HAVING
TO EXPLAIN TO MY FATHER

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:27.031
THAT THIS PIECE OF SHIT IS
MY GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC.

01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:30.301
HERE HE IS, AND YOU BETTER TALK TO HIM.

01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:34.071
- BE TOUGH!
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:36.741
SIR, PARDON ME. EXCUSE ME?

01:09:36.741 --> 01:09:39.143
I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT MIX-UP HERE.

01:09:39.143 --> 01:09:42.680
IT SEEMS YOU'VE MISTAKENLY
DRIVEN OFF WITH OUR CAR.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.417
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. YOU'RE VERY KIND.

01:09:46.417 --> 01:09:50.388
- Les: WHAT THE HELL? - COME ON,
GET THE JUICE- HEAD TO PULL OVER!

01:09:50.388 --> 01:09:52.523

01:09:52.523 --> 01:09:54.291
( vomits )

01:09:57.895 --> 01:10:01.032
LES, HE JUST VOMITED IN YOUR CAR.

01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:02.833
( groans )

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.969
( gargling )

01:10:07.138 --> 01:10:09.106
OH SHIT!

01:10:15.646 --> 01:10:17.381
WHOO! WHAT AIRLINE IS THIS?!

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:19.650
COME ON, GO! YEAH!

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.485
- COME ON!

01:10:21.485 --> 01:10:24.488
HEY, CHECK IT OUT. SPONGEHEAD'S
ACTUALLY DRIVING STRAIGHT.

01:10:24.488 --> 01:10:26.190
WHAT HE DO, SOBER UP?

01:10:29.293 --> 01:10:32.596

01:10:32.596 --> 01:10:34.899

01:10:37.635 --> 01:10:41.305
CHARLES, YOU TAKE THE GAS. DEANO, YOU
TAKE THE WHEEL. I'M GOING OUT THERE.

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:43.274
WAIT A MINUTE! NO, LES, IT'S JUST A CAR!

01:10:43.274 --> 01:10:46.243
YOU TRY TELLING THAT TO MY FATHER!

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:49.413
- Charles: BE CAREFUL, LES!
- HOLD IT STEADY!

01:10:49.413 --> 01:10:52.717
- DEAN, HOLD THE CAR STEADY!
- COME ON.

01:10:52.717 --> 01:10:55.686
KEEP IT STRAIGHT, WOULD YOU?

01:10:58.089 --> 01:10:59.590
SHIT.

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:01.792
STOP IT.

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:04.295
- YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL.
-LES!

01:11:04.295 --> 01:11:07.531
- ( ripping )
- WHOA!

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:09.867
I'M GONNA FALL! DEANO!

01:11:09.867 --> 01:11:11.402

DEANO! WHOA!

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:17.375
MISTER!

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:20.277
WAKE UP, WOULD YOU!? COME ON.

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.646
WAKE UP! PLEASE, WAKE UP!

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:25.449

01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:26.617
SHIT.

01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:30.788
WHOA! DEANO, HELP!

01:11:31.956 --> 01:11:33.824
Dean: WE'RE LOSING HIM!

01:11:33.824 --> 01:11:35.593
HI, LES!

01:11:44.035 --> 01:11:45.936
GOD, I HATE DRUNK DRIVERS.

01:11:50.107 --> 01:11:53.310
WHAT?! OH NO!

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:55.079
WATCH THE ROAD, COME ON!

01:11:57.948 --> 01:11:59.717
Both: OH SHIT!

01:12:01.652 --> 01:12:04.021
NO, NO!

01:12:06.257 --> 01:12:08.526
( screams )

01:12:23.908 --> 01:12:26.210
( horn blaring )

01:12:42.727 --> 01:12:44.662
( drunk snoring )

01:12:47.398 --> 01:12:49.333
- ( horn stops )
- ( drunk mumbles )

01:13:06.417 --> 01:13:09.987
- Charles: GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- Dean: YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY FACE!

01:13:09.987 --> 01:13:12.056
OH, YOU'RE ALIVE! WE
THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

01:13:12.056 --> 01:13:14.859
OH MY GOD, DID YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID?

01:13:14.859 --> 01:13:16.827
HONEY, I'M HOME!

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:18.963
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:13:18.963 --> 01:13:21.298
WHO ARE YOU?!

01:13:21.298 --> 01:13:24.135
WELL, MY FRIEND, YOU'RE A
LITTLE THIEF. GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.

01:13:24.135 --> 01:13:26.904
YES, BUT SEE, "FRIENDS DON'T
LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK."

01:13:26.904 --> 01:13:30.107
- ( laughs )
- YOU CALL YOURSELF A FRIEND?

01:13:30.107 --> 01:13:32.476
LOOK, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!

01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:36.047
YOU ARE AN ANIMAL. I MEAN,
NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!

01:13:36.047 --> 01:13:39.450
YEAH, NOT TOO BAD FOR A KID
WITHOUT HIS LICENSE, HUH?

01:13:58.469 --> 01:14:02.206
LES, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
LICENSE OR NO LICENSE,

01:14:02.206 --> 01:14:05.109
THAT WAS ONE INTENSE DISPLAY OF DRIVING.

01:14:05.109 --> 01:14:07.111
YEAH, AND AS FAR AS A FIRST NIGHT OUT

01:14:07.111 --> 01:14:09.380
ON THE TOWN WITH A CAR IS CONCERNED,

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.615
THAT ONE DEFINITELY SETS THE STANDARD.

01:14:11.615 --> 01:14:14.785
THANK GOD YOU DON'T GET YOUR LICENSE
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUDDY.

01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:17.121
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL SLEEPING BEAUTY?

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:19.256
I DON'T KNOW.

01:14:20.391 --> 01:14:22.393
SHH.

01:14:22.393 --> 01:14:25.096
- GOOD NIGHT, LES.
- YEAH.

01:14:25.096 --> 01:14:26.731
SEE YOU LATER, LES.

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:41.746
( moaning )

01:14:45.316 --> 01:14:47.918
- ROBERT?
- MM?

01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:50.621
THIS IS IT. ( chuckles )

01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:53.691
- THAT'S NICE, HONEY.
- THIS IS IT.

01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:56.127
I'M UP! I'M UP, I'M UP!

01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:59.296
OKAY, DO YOUR BREATHING.
( rapid breathing )

01:14:59.296 --> 01:15:01.732
HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?

01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:04.235
FIVE MINUTES? FINE, PLENTY OF TIME.

01:15:04.235 --> 01:15:08.272
THAT DREAM WAS SO BIZARRE, LES,

01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:10.608
AS IF I WAS TRAPPED
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.

01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:13.477
AND SUDDENLY THE TRUNK FLIPPED OPEN

01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:16.847
AND THERE YOU WERE RESCUING ME.

01:15:16.847 --> 01:15:19.850
- SO WEIRD.
- SOUNDS CRAZY.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:22.653
OH, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT...

01:15:22.653 --> 01:15:25.122
SOMEHOW YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE TO HOLD ME

01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:27.024
LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

01:15:27.024 --> 01:15:30.661
I FELT SO SAFE AND SO WARM.

01:15:32.196 --> 01:15:35.032
I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH A SLEEPY
- HEAD TONIGHT.

01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:37.768
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO BORED.
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

01:15:37.768 --> 01:15:40.871
TONIGHT FOR ME WAS
LIKE NON-STOP ACTION.

01:15:42.506 --> 01:15:45.609
- WHEN CAN WE GO OUT AGAIN?
- HONESTLY, MERCEDES,

01:15:45.609 --> 01:15:48.479
TONIGHT MIGHT BE THE LAST NIGHT
ANYBODY EVER SEES ME ALIVE.

01:15:48.479 --> 01:15:50.481
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

01:15:51.882 --> 01:15:53.918
IT'S A LONG COMPLICATED STORY.

01:15:53.918 --> 01:15:56.487
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

01:15:56.487 --> 01:15:58.356
DOES IT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING?

01:15:59.724 --> 01:16:01.759
UH-HUH, HAS SO FAR.

01:16:01.759 --> 01:16:04.161
HOPEFULLY ONE DAY I'LL GET
TO TELL YOU HOW IT ENDS.

01:16:04.161 --> 01:16:06.397
I'LL BE HERE.

01:16:14.772 --> 01:16:16.273
BYE.

01:16:22.146 --> 01:16:23.681
- OW!
- THE BABY?

01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:25.349
NO, THE LACES ARE TOO TIGHT.

01:16:25.349 --> 01:16:27.585
- OKAY--
-ROBERT!

01:16:27.585 --> 01:16:29.787
HONEY?

01:16:29.787 --> 01:16:32.123
- ( chuckling )
- OH WAIT, LET ME GET MY JACKET.

01:16:32.123 --> 01:16:34.925
- WHERE'S MY JACKET?
- OKAY, OKAY.

01:16:34.925 --> 01:16:37.261
- OKAY.
- OH, I FORGOT THE BAG.

01:16:37.261 --> 01:16:39.964
IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA WAIT HERE.

01:16:39.964 --> 01:16:41.966
- OKAY.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, HONEY.

01:16:41.966 --> 01:16:44.769
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:16:44.769 --> 01:16:47.438
- OW! ANOTHER ONE.
- OH NO. OKAY.

01:16:47.438 --> 01:16:50.041
OKAY. YEAH. PUT YOUR ARM ON ME.

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:52.143
( rapid breathing )

01:16:53.711 --> 01:16:55.880
OH MAN.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.348
HERE WE GO.

01:17:01.852 --> 01:17:03.788
( rattling )

01:17:07.892 --> 01:17:10.528
( rapid breathing )

01:17:10.528 --> 01:17:13.230
- UH-OH. -
WHAT? WHAT?

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:17.001
- WHAT?
- GOSH, I'M FINE.

01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:20.237
- SORRY, I'M FINE NOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE FINE?

01:17:20.237 --> 01:17:23.040
I THINK IT WAS AIR BUBBLES
FROM THE PICKLE OR SOMETHING.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.644
ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN,
THE CAR'S RIGHT HERE.

01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:28.679
I'M SORRY. I'M FINE.

01:17:31.282 --> 01:17:34.051
WHY IS THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN?

01:17:34.051 --> 01:17:36.087
NATALIE PROBABLY LEFT IT OPEN.

01:17:36.087 --> 01:17:38.222
NO, HONEY, NATALIE TOOK THE AUDI.

01:17:38.222 --> 01:17:40.992
- WHERE THE HELL IS THE AUDI?
- ( muffled )OW.

01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:45.763
ROBERT!

01:17:45.763 --> 01:17:48.432
-WHAT THE--

01:17:49.633 --> 01:17:51.402
HONEY, KEEP BREATHING!

01:17:51.402 --> 01:17:54.105
WHOA! WHOA!

01:17:54.105 --> 01:17:56.273
( rapid breathing )

01:17:56.273 --> 01:17:58.843
( groaning )

01:18:01.445 --> 01:18:03.914
( whimpering )

01:18:12.623 --> 01:18:15.459
( moaning )

01:18:25.836 --> 01:18:27.772
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR BED, LES?

01:18:29.807 --> 01:18:33.544
MIND EXPLAINING WHAT SIZE
SHARK WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

01:18:35.346 --> 01:18:37.581
- WELL-- - NO, I
DON'T WANT TO KNOW!

01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:39.583
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
SAVE IT FOR THE JUDGE.

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:42.853
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TONIGHT, LES?

01:18:42.853 --> 01:18:44.889
WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOUR FUTURE

01:18:44.889 --> 01:18:46.824
IN THIS HOUSE AND ON THIS PLANET?

01:18:46.824 --> 01:18:49.727
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- NO, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY!

01:18:49.727 --> 01:18:51.696
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE!

01:18:53.397 --> 01:18:55.933
WE HAD A COLLEGE FUND SET ASIDE FOR YOU.

01:18:55.933 --> 01:18:57.935
THAT'S GONE NOW.

01:18:57.935 --> 01:18:59.637
YOU HAD FREE ROOM AND BOARD,

01:18:59.637 --> 01:19:02.673
TWO TRUSTING PARENTS AND A SOCIAL LIFE.

01:19:02.673 --> 01:19:04.675
IT'S ALL GONE.

01:19:04.675 --> 01:19:08.479
YOU HAD A TV, A STEREO, A BASEBALL MITT,

01:19:08.479 --> 01:19:10.448
A TENNIS RACKET, A SKATEBOARD,

01:19:10.448 --> 01:19:13.184
A BICYCLE--
ALL GONE!

01:19:13.184 --> 01:19:16.320
YOU EVEN HAD SUNLIGHT
AND A WINDOW IN YOUR ROOM.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.688
ROBERT!

01:19:17.688 --> 01:19:20.291
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BUDDY BOY,

01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:23.527
YOU ARE DAMN LUCKY YOUR MOTHER

01:19:23.527 --> 01:19:25.363
ROBBY, IAM IN LABOR!

01:19:25.363 --> 01:19:29.066

HONEY, YOU OKAY?

01:19:31.002 --> 01:19:33.804
- HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:19:33.804 --> 01:19:36.040
YOU DON'T KNOW? IS IT
ONE MINUTE, TWO MINUTES?

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.075
- HOW CLOSE?
- TOO CLOSE.

01:19:38.075 --> 01:19:39.577
NO HANDLE!

01:19:39.577 --> 01:19:42.480
NO HANDLE. NO HANDLE.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.249
OKAY, HONEY, WE'LL BE IN
A HOSPITAL IN A MINUTE.

01:19:45.249 --> 01:19:47.485
- SIT DOWN. WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- OH ROBERT.

01:19:47.485 --> 01:19:50.087
- COME IN THE BACKSEAT WITH ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.

01:19:50.087 --> 01:19:52.223
- I HAVE TO DRIVE.
- LES CAN DRIVE.

01:19:52.223 --> 01:19:54.959
WHAT? LES WHO? NOT THAT LES.

01:19:54.959 --> 01:19:57.595

01:20:01.232 --> 01:20:03.067
DAD, LET ME DRIVE.

01:20:04.869 --> 01:20:07.238
- I CAN DO IT, DAD.

01:20:07.238 --> 01:20:10.741
ROBERT, PLEASE STAY WITH ME. I NEED YOU.

01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:16.113
- DAD?
- OKAY, YOU DRIVE.

01:20:16.113 --> 01:20:18.349
BUT TRY AND DO IT LIKE

01:20:18.349 --> 01:20:20.785
LET ME OPEN THE DOOR!

01:20:24.155 --> 01:20:27.224
Rudy: EW! IT SMELLS LIKE PUKE IN HERE!

01:20:27.224 --> 01:20:30.628
- Les: SHUT UP, RUDY.
- ( tires screech )

01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:36.400
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- SORRY, IT'S A RED LIGHT.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.636
ARE YOU CRAZY? THERE ISN'T CAR IN SIGHT.

01:20:38.636 --> 01:20:41.706
WE'RE RUSHING YOUR MOTHER TO THE
HOSPITAL, NOT TO A BRIDGE GAME!

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.474
COME ON, GO THROUGH IT. GO THROUGH IT.

01:20:46.143 --> 01:20:47.712
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COME ON!

01:20:47.712 --> 01:20:49.513
I'M PUSHING THE GAS. IT AIN'T MOVING.

01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:51.816
SOUNDS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION.
TRY ANOTHER GEAR.

01:20:53.517 --> 01:20:55.186
- COME ON, TRY LOW.
- MOM?

01:20:55.186 --> 01:20:57.855
DON'T WORRY, I'M JUST HAVING A BABY.

01:20:59.256 --> 01:21:02.293
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- REVERSE WORKS, DAD.

01:21:04.862 --> 01:21:06.530
HONEY?

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:08.899
LET HIM DRIVE BACKWARDS.

01:21:08.899 --> 01:21:11.235
LET HIM DRIVE SIDEWAYS, I DON'T CARE.

01:21:11.235 --> 01:21:13.604
JUST GET ME THERE!

01:21:15.306 --> 01:21:17.274
ALL RIGHT.

01:21:17.274 --> 01:21:19.610
- BUT BE CAREFUL.

01:21:27.218 --> 01:21:29.020
( Mrs. Anderson screams )

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.822
- Mr. Anderson: THE BABY?
- NO, THE GOLF CLUBS.

01:21:31.822 --> 01:21:33.791
OH, OKAY.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:37.795

- I-- I GUESS LAST

01:23:48.492 --> 01:23:51.028
