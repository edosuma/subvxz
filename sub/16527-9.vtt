09:21.188 --> 09:23.158
BOTH:
Hannah.

09:24.662 --> 09:26.766
Excuse me, ma'am?

09:26.766 --> 09:28.335
Are you here to
meet Elena Tull?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.972
Who are you?

09:29.972 --> 09:32.143
We're with LAPD. Homicide.

09:37.153 --> 09:39.190
That son of a bitch.

09:39.190 --> 09:40.359
He killed her, didn't he?

09:40.359 --> 09:41.461
Who?

09:41.461 --> 09:42.698
No, you first.

09:42.698 --> 09:43.499
What do you know?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.771
MURTAUGH:
Doesn't work like that.

09:45.771 --> 09:47.106
We ask the questions.

09:47.106 --> 09:49.444
Look, let's start
with an easy one.

09:49.444 --> 09:51.983
What was your
relationship with Elena?

09:51.983 --> 09:54.054
Friends.

09:54.054 --> 09:56.726
Uh... colleagues,
I guess you can say.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.462
You're a nurse?
Journalist.

09:58.462 --> 10:00.066
I'm on the city desk

10:00.066 --> 10:01.301
at the <i>L. A. Sentinel.</i>

10:01.301 --> 10:02.303
What do you cover?

10:02.303 --> 10:04.307
Crimes, drugs.

10:04.307 --> 10:05.811
Cartel's rise in L. A.

10:05.811 --> 10:07.981
All right,
so we can cut the crap.

10:07.981 --> 10:09.484
You know exactly
who she was dating.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.054
Yeah. I know.

10:11.054 --> 10:13.425
You know what kind of man he is?
More so than you.

10:13.425 --> 10:15.362
I was writing a piece

10:15.362 --> 10:16.799
on Eddie Flores.

10:16.799 --> 10:18.102
Elena was my source.

10:18.102 --> 10:19.505
MURTAUGH:
Did she know
how dangerous he was?

10:19.505 --> 10:20.974
She knew.

10:20.974 --> 10:22.845
At first she didn't know
who he was,

10:22.845 --> 10:25.984
but she was a bright girl,
she caught on.

10:25.984 --> 10:26.986
Instead of ending it,

10:26.986 --> 10:28.556
she wanted
to take him down.

10:28.556 --> 10:29.992
So why not go to the cops?

10:29.992 --> 10:32.363
You guys have any luck
catching Eddie yet?

10:32.363 --> 10:34.067
MURTAUGH:
Elena is dead,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.806
and if Eddie finds out
that she was <i>your</i> source,

10:36.806 --> 10:38.576
then your life
is in danger, too.

10:38.576 --> 10:41.014
So, suggest that maybe you...

10:41.014 --> 10:43.853
Keep a low profile,
let you guys handle the case.

10:43.853 --> 10:45.322
Yeah, I know the drill.

10:45.322 --> 10:48.495
I think you're underestimating
what Eddie's capable of.

10:48.495 --> 10:51.234
I know Eduardo Flores,
Detective.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.504
And nothing would
make me happier

10:52.504 --> 10:55.911
than if I was underestimating
what you guys are capable of.

10:57.848 --> 10:59.350
Do you know
where we can find him?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.370
Not exactly
keeping a low profile.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.308
Anyone can find him.

11:11.308 --> 11:13.212
Question is,

11:13.212 --> 11:15.382
who has the balls
to take him down?

across the room

12:45.396 --> 12:47.099

13:06.304 --> 13:07.339
All right.

13:07.339 --> 13:08.208
Hey, Riggs,

13:08.208 --> 13:10.212
you know how cruel
this world can be.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.420
How's that?

13:15.489 --> 13:17.326
Sometimes we lose people, right?

13:43.044 --> 13:44.480
I'm sorry, Detective.

13:45.683 --> 13:46.752
Not like this,
Riggs.

13:46.752 --> 13:48.355
Too many people looking.

pushed Flores off a ledge.

14:18.448 --> 14:19.718

he loves "the gays,"

Eddie said something
about Riggs' wife.

Do I need to take him
off the case?

14:39.156 --> 14:40.593
No.

We got this.

18:27.947 --> 18:29.784
Yeah, either way,
very thoughtful gift.

18:29.784 --> 18:31.253
It's more of a bribe.

18:32.289 --> 18:34.661
I need you to look at this
for me.

18:34.661 --> 18:35.796
Sure.

18:35.796 --> 18:38.802
Oh, this is from El Paso.

18:38.802 --> 18:40.171
Yeah, um...

18:40.940 --> 18:42.008
I'm just trying

18:42.008 --> 18:43.010
to find any inconsistencies.

18:43.010 --> 18:44.914
You know, they said that
the truck driver was‐‐

18:44.914 --> 18:45.950
he was intoxicated,

18:45.950 --> 18:48.354
but I can't find any
evidence that supports that.

18:48.354 --> 18:51.460
Um...

18:51.460 --> 18:53.331
Honestly, I don't know
what it is I'm looking for.

18:53.331 --> 18:55.636
I just need some
expert eyes on it.

18:55.636 --> 18:56.838
Sure.

18:56.838 --> 18:58.307
Victim's name is Miranda...

18:59.744 --> 19:01.882
Oh, uh, this is, um...

19:01.882 --> 19:02.917
An accident report.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.821
I know, but, um...

19:04.821 --> 19:06.892
McNeile blew the grid!

19:06.892 --> 19:08.796
My next door neighbor, McNeile.

19:08.796 --> 19:10.566
He overpowered
his Christmas lights

19:10.566 --> 19:11.802
and blew my power.

19:12.804 --> 19:14.439
(sighs)

19:15.475 --> 19:16.578
What's going on here?

19:17.613 --> 19:18.715
Riggs, uh,

19:18.715 --> 19:20.853
brought me
a Christmas present!

19:20.853 --> 19:22.489
Hey, 'tis the season, right?

19:22.489 --> 19:23.959
Speaking of gifts,

19:23.959 --> 19:25.461
Bailey tracked down

19:25.461 --> 19:26.463
Elena Tull's
purchase history.

19:26.463 --> 19:30.271
She just bought a wireless
home security camera.

19:30.271 --> 19:32.342
She was recording Eddie.
Yeah.

19:32.342 --> 19:35.481
And hopefully, that camera's
still in the penthouse.

19:35.481 --> 19:37.052
Maybe Santa came early
this year.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.356
Riggs, thanks for the...

19:39.356 --> 19:40.491
I got it.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.897
Thanks.

20:06.811 --> 20:08.414
Don't shoot.

20:08.414 --> 20:09.817
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.821
Elena borrowed
something of mine.

20:11.821 --> 20:12.924
I needed to get it back.

20:12.924 --> 20:14.928
Oh, not so fast,
not so fast.

20:14.928 --> 20:16.130
I need to see
what's in the bag.

20:16.130 --> 20:17.432
I'm sorry,
do you have a warrant?

20:17.432 --> 20:18.568
MURTAUGH:
We don't need one.

20:18.568 --> 20:20.506
You broke into
a crime scene.

20:23.712 --> 20:24.981
(sighs)

20:31.561 --> 20:32.697
Do you know how
many journalists

20:32.697 --> 20:33.999
have been killed
by the Flores cartel?

20:33.999 --> 20:36.604
Over 400 in Juarez alone.

20:36.604 --> 20:39.142
They think they can silence us
through intimidation.

20:39.142 --> 20:40.512
I'm not scared.

20:40.512 --> 20:41.915
With any luck, what's on this

20:41.915 --> 20:43.952
gonna put Eddie Flores away.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.656
Can I go now?

20:45.656 --> 20:47.492
Merry Christmas.

20:49.564 --> 20:51.500
(phone ringing)

20:53.739 --> 20:55.509
Yeah?

20:55.509 --> 20:57.880
EDDIE: How you like the view
from my apartment, Detective?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.084
Damn it, she took
the SD card.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.523
It's Flores.

21:02.523 --> 21:04.159
Okay, you talk to him,
I'm going after her.

21:04.159 --> 21:07.600
(door opens, closes)

21:07.600 --> 21:09.704
Eddie!

21:09.704 --> 21:11.106
What's up, buddy?

21:11.106 --> 21:12.843
What, did you call
to confess?

21:12.843 --> 21:14.514
(laughs)
My conscience is clean.

21:14.514 --> 21:16.885
I was thinking about
our time in Texas.

21:16.885 --> 21:18.487
You were such a cowboy.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.891
What brought you out to L. A.?

21:19.891 --> 21:22.028
Ah, you know,

21:22.028 --> 21:23.832
smog, traffic.

21:23.832 --> 21:24.801
How 'bout you?

21:24.801 --> 21:27.005
Your uncle finally kick
you out of Mexico?

21:27.005 --> 21:29.009
EDDIE:
<i>Nah, I came for the girls, man.</i>

21:29.009 --> 21:30.011
<i>Same as you.</i>

21:30.011 --> 21:32.048
Your hot Chicana wife

21:32.048 --> 21:33.785
was from here, wasn't she?

21:33.785 --> 21:35.088
Mention my wife one more time.

21:35.088 --> 21:36.156
(car alarm chirps)

21:36.156 --> 21:37.793
<i>You're such a hot head, Riggs.</i>

21:37.793 --> 21:39.931
<i>I'm just like you, though.</i>

21:39.931 --> 21:41.500
<i>I get angry and then...</i>

21:41.500 --> 21:42.803
<i>boom.</i>

21:42.803 --> 21:44.072
<i>I just explode.</i>

21:50.719 --> 21:52.690
(car alarms wailing)

21:59.312 --> 22:01.039
The IED was triggered
by a modified cell phone.

22:01.039 --> 22:04.045
It could have been detonated
from anywhere by a text.

22:04.045 --> 22:06.016
Any way to figure out
who was on the other end?

22:06.016 --> 22:07.085
It was a burner.

22:07.085 --> 22:09.724
SCORSESE:
Untraceable.
He's playing with us.

22:09.724 --> 22:12.630
He called me to brag
while we watched her burn.

22:12.630 --> 22:15.602
Scorsese, were you able
to recover

22:15.602 --> 22:16.871
anything else
from the victim?

22:16.871 --> 22:18.875
I found the SD card
from Hannah's bag.

22:18.875 --> 22:22.081
It was badly damaged, but
there was a cache of data.

22:22.081 --> 22:23.552
There's a password
on it, though.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.654
It's up with Bailey now.

22:24.654 --> 22:27.091
Okay, so we get him
with the video.

22:27.091 --> 22:29.764
How long's that gonna take?
And what if it doesn't work?

22:29.764 --> 22:30.899
Even if it doesn't work,

22:30.899 --> 22:33.638
we will get him
with something else.
All right, Rog.

22:33.638 --> 22:34.840
We know exactly what he did.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.578
All of us know
exactly what he did

22:36.578 --> 22:37.580
and where to find him,

22:37.580 --> 22:38.882
and we're not doing
a damn thing about it.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.284
Okay, this is
what he wants.

22:40.284 --> 22:41.788
He wants to get in our heads,

22:41.788 --> 22:43.123
make us go after him now,
and make a mistake.

22:43.123 --> 22:45.629
What he's doing is
he's laughing at us!

22:45.629 --> 22:47.600
He killed Elena,
he killed Hannah,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.737
and he killed Miranda.
And you know that how?

22:49.737 --> 22:51.908
Because it's what
he's telling you.

22:51.908 --> 22:53.745
It's what he wants you
to believe.

22:53.745 --> 22:55.248
Please tell him
about the report!

22:55.248 --> 22:56.918
Report? What report?

22:56.918 --> 22:59.890
I gave Scorsese
Miranda's accident report.

22:59.890 --> 23:01.561
So please tell him.

23:01.561 --> 23:03.832
Sorry, Riggs.

23:03.832 --> 23:05.636
There wasn't anything
to indicate

23:05.636 --> 23:07.272
it wasn't an accident.

23:07.272 --> 23:10.111
What about the tox report?

23:10.111 --> 23:11.714
The driver wasn't drunk.

23:11.714 --> 23:13.752
There was nothing there.

23:16.724 --> 23:18.528
Hey, look, I know
how hard this can be.

23:18.528 --> 23:19.764
No, you don't.

23:19.764 --> 23:23.003
Riggs, I need you
to keep it together.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.005
Can you do that?

23:24.005 --> 23:25.842
I've been keeping it together,

23:25.842 --> 23:27.880
and look where
that got me.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.117
Why don't you keep it together
for the both of us.

23:40.204 --> 23:42.075
He'll be fine.
Those headphones cost more

23:42.075 --> 23:44.045
than my first stereo.
Yeah, I know.

23:44.045 --> 23:46.951
But he really does think
he's getting a car.

Riggs.
Hmm.

I guess I should
start asking,

24:11.266 --> 24:12.970
"What's wrong with Riggs?"

24:12.970 --> 24:15.074
Well, this cartel guy
keeps messing with his head,

24:15.074 --> 24:17.178
trying to make him think
that he had something to do

24:17.178 --> 24:18.615
with his wife's death.

24:19.315 --> 24:20.852
Did he?
No.

He's baiting him,

24:25.327 --> 24:28.935
I know I'm telling you something
you probably already know,

24:28.935 --> 24:30.337
but you need to
be there for him.

24:30.337 --> 24:34.145
I'm trying, believe me,
but he's not having it.

24:34.145 --> 24:36.617
Hmm.

You know,
this time last year...

he probably thought
this Christmas

24:42.796 --> 24:44.232
he would be with
his wife and baby.

24:46.269 --> 24:48.140
Now he's alone.

24:50.177 --> 24:51.246
Can you imagine that?

24:53.016 --> 24:56.089
No. I can't.

(sighs)

26:58.366 --> 26:59.837
Ah...

27:02.909 --> 27:04.980
I came to apologize.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.118
I need to be a little
more understanding

27:07.118 --> 27:10.925
about... how hard this time
of year is for you.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.467
Why don't you go home, Rog?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.138
Go be with your family.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.781
Is that gun for Flores?

27:21.781 --> 27:24.820
Don't go asking questions
you don't want the answers to.

27:26.824 --> 27:30.832
Well, here's one
I need answered.

27:30.832 --> 27:33.971
If you go and kill
Flores in cold blood,

27:33.971 --> 27:35.407
what's left for you?

27:39.015 --> 27:41.386
What's left for me now?

27:41.386 --> 27:44.058
You really feel that way,
then you need to go ahead

27:44.058 --> 27:45.862
and turn that thing
on yourself.

27:49.135 --> 27:52.274
Look, Riggs...
we don't know yet

27:52.274 --> 27:55.882
if Flores had anything
to do with Miranda.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.886
The best way to find out

27:57.886 --> 27:59.556
is to arrest him
for the murders

27:59.556 --> 28:02.929
of two women
we <i>know</i> he killed.

28:02.929 --> 28:05.234
Once we have him, we can
find out the rest.

28:05.234 --> 28:08.073
What if he pleads down,
or walks?

28:08.073 --> 28:09.977
If we get him the right way,

28:09.977 --> 28:11.412
and he walks,

28:11.412 --> 28:13.116
I will help you find him.

28:13.116 --> 28:15.120
I'm not asking
for your help, Roger.

28:17.258 --> 28:19.563
I know.

28:19.563 --> 28:22.301
You never do.

28:33.123 --> 28:35.127
But I know he killed her.

28:35.127 --> 28:38.033
So one way or another,
it's either him or me.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.548
What are you still
doing here?

28:45.548 --> 28:48.019
I thought you got a promotion
so you can go home early.

28:48.019 --> 28:49.188
He's avoiding his in‐laws.

28:49.188 --> 28:50.992
No, I'm closing
a double homicide.

28:50.992 --> 28:52.328
So he doesn't have
to commit one.

28:52.328 --> 28:53.597
But we did crack
the password.

28:53.597 --> 28:54.599
You got video?

28:54.599 --> 28:57.505
Yeah, but it's not
that great of quality.

28:57.505 --> 29:00.545
It's tough to ID
who Elena's with.

29:00.545 --> 29:03.951
Aw, come on, that's Eddie.
That's his clothes,

29:03.951 --> 29:04.987
the way he walks‐‐
it's him.

29:04.987 --> 29:07.391
Won't hold up in court.
We need to see his face.

29:14.573 --> 29:16.209
Come on, turn around.

29:20.918 --> 29:22.622
I knew it.
He's gonna walk.

29:22.622 --> 29:24.325
Play that again.

29:24.325 --> 29:26.997
Rog, it doesn't matter.
You can't see his face.

29:26.997 --> 29:28.133
Play it.

29:28.133 --> 29:31.205
Wait, stop. Look at that tree.

29:31.205 --> 29:34.245
Those big, gaudy bulbs.
AVERY: Rog, we get it.

29:34.245 --> 29:36.082
You hate the exploitation
of the holiday.

29:36.082 --> 29:38.521

42:36.341 --> 42:37.443
Come on.

42:37.443 --> 42:39.046
♪ Baby, please come home... ♪

42:39.046 --> 42:41.417
Now, does the stove work?

42:41.417 --> 42:44.457
Uh, I didn't even know
there was a stove under there.

42:44.457 --> 42:45.325
Let's see.

42:45.325 --> 42:47.296
Hey! We're in luck.

42:48.465 --> 42:49.968
There we go.
TRISH: Yeah, look at that.

42:49.968 --> 42:50.970
Yeah.

42:50.970 --> 42:52.172
(whispers):
Thanks.

42:54.276 --> 42:56.280
Yeah, one other thing.
Surprise for you.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.717
Courtesy of my neighbor.

42:58.886 --> 43:00.823
Mr. Jim McNeile.

43:02.794 --> 43:03.896
(Murtaugh laughs)

43:03.896 --> 43:05.298
Something outside?
Yeah!

43:06.234 --> 43:08.171
(electricity crackling)

43:08.171 --> 43:09.708
TRISH: Roger!
ROGER JR.: Dad!

43:09.708 --> 43:12.179
ROGER: I'm sorry. I thought
it was funny. Remember we were
laughing...

43:12.179 --> 43:14.417
TRISH: No, we didn't laugh about
that.
