00:02.127 --> 00:04.671
Okay, so, for my birthday
tonight, no gifts.

00:04.754 --> 00:06.965
Especially that expensive top
we saw at the Gap.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.299
- I do not want--
- Pink?

00:08.383 --> 00:09.843
Blue, medium.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.679
You know what
I just realized, Tina?

00:12.762 --> 00:14.431
[gasps]
Your birthday
will be Vince and I's

00:14.514 --> 00:16.558
first birthday party
as a couple.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.227
So, now my birthday
is all about you?

00:19.310 --> 00:20.770
And Vince.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.607
Oh, it's just that Vince
and I are doing so great.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.235
We don't yell anymore,
we discuss, you know?

00:27.318 --> 00:29.362
And if one of us,
Vince, does something

00:29.446 --> 00:33.158
to make the other one,
me, mad, we communicate

00:33.241 --> 00:36.619
and then he apologizes.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.955
- Oh, my God! Gary. Quick, hide!
- Well, why?

00:39.038 --> 00:41.374
Because you made out yesterday.
It's gonna be awkward.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.961
Ugh, okay, we are fine. It's
like it never even happened.

00:45.044 --> 00:48.381
Hey, Holly. Hey, Tina.
What do you guys want?

00:48.465 --> 00:50.049
No, I'll just have
a chocolate muffin.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.011
But you just made out with
a chocolate muffin yesterday.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.682
Would you shut up? There
is nothing between me and Gary.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.310
I can't stand him. What
happened between us was just--

01:00.393 --> 01:02.896
- Gary?
- Who's that ho?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.899
Hey, Stacy! How are you?

01:05.982 --> 01:09.486
Ooh. Somebody a little jeal-o?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.739
Ha ha! That was the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.326
It's like looking in a mirror
when I was 18-and-a-half.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.660
So, I lost my cell phone

01:17.744 --> 01:20.163
which, of course, had
everyone's number in it.

01:20.246 --> 01:24.334
But the only one that
I have to have is Vince's.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.836
What'd the ho say?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.756
Will you give Vince my number?

01:29.839 --> 01:32.008
Ooh, he's so crazy sexy!

01:32.091 --> 01:34.886
Okay, scoot, scoot.
Gary gets the picture.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.890
Whoo! Heh heh heh.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.230

wanted Vince's number.

"My boyfriend's parents
are coming to New York

10:26.792 --> 10:29.628
"Halloween weekend, and
they'll need a place to stay

10:29.712 --> 10:31.547
so go then."

10:31.630 --> 10:33.132
Aw, mom. Heh.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.092
You guys want to spend
a weekend in Vermont?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.887
It all depends. Would Vince have
good cell phone reception there?

10:37.970 --> 10:41.599
'Cause he may want to
call up one of his numbers.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.769
I can always use Holly's
ankle bracelet as an antenna.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.939
Hey, hey. That's enough, people.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.566
Now, look at here.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.235
Tina has graciously
invited all of us

10:53.319 --> 10:56.072
to spend a lovely weekend
in Vermont.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.158
Now, I, for one,
adore free stuff!

11:01.118 --> 11:02.495
Why don't you and Tina just go?

11:02.578 --> 11:05.289
- No!
- My mom said to take friends!

11:05.373 --> 11:06.957
Sorry, Tina, but I can't come.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.418
Oh, just take off
the damn anklet, girl.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.421
As soon as he deletes all
the freakin' numbers, moron!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.048
- Yeah.
- Well, why should he?

11:14.131 --> 11:15.925
He told her those girls
were just friends.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.468
I mean, why can't she
just trust the boy?

11:17.551 --> 11:19.095
- Yeah.
- Trust him?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.430
The boy has been with,
like, a gazillion girls

11:21.514 --> 11:22.598
including her best friend.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.892
- Yeah!
- I'm really sorry.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.103
We'll talk about it later.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.313
Well, what about him
trusting her?

11:29.397 --> 11:31.941
I mean, first,
she's <i> all</i> with Henry

11:32.024 --> 11:34.485
and then she's all about Vince,
then she goes back to Henry

11:34.568 --> 11:37.571
then she goes to Europe
and brings back a European.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.782
No wonder he needs
to keep those numbers.

11:39.865 --> 11:43.494
He needs a backup. No telling
who she'll meet in Vermont.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.039
Okay, wait, is that true?
Do you not trust me?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.708
Well, now that Gary
has thought about it

11:49.792 --> 11:51.585
no, I do not trust you.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.295
You don't trust me?
Wait a minute!

11:53.379 --> 11:55.047
Our whole thing
is that I don't trust you!

11:55.131 --> 11:58.259
Well, our whole new thing is
that we don't trust each other.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.053
Well, look what you did, Gary.
You make me sick.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.764
- Well, I hate you.
- I could bite you.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.850
Well, I could take
your red ponytail

12:05.933 --> 12:08.644
and swing you around
and round and round.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.020
Okay, I am so outta here.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.440
You guys, thank you
for a lovely birthday!

12:13.399 --> 12:15.568
Great. Now, look what you did.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.321
Great. Now, look what you did.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.907
Great. Now, look what you..

12:21.991 --> 12:24.368
Well, I could never
be mad at you, Jacuzzi.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.041
[instrumental music]

12:35.463 --> 12:38.799
Ha. Okay, well, this is me.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.594
- And this is me.
- Okay.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.429
Uh, well, Charlie, uh

12:43.512 --> 12:47.099
that was the best,
most romantic date

12:47.183 --> 12:49.685
I've had in, like, ever!

12:54.982 --> 12:56.734
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

12:56.817 --> 12:58.777
[sighs]
My brother's not home.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.946
Great!

13:01.030 --> 13:01.989
[door closes]

13:02.072 --> 13:03.324
Oh, God, he is home.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.242
Uh, kiss me!

13:12.625 --> 13:14.919
Lauren, what are you doing here?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.504
[computer chimes]

13:18.255 --> 13:20.591
Excuse me, I just
swallowed a xylophone.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.219
You found where I hid
your computer.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.263
Oh, what, a person
can't just swallow a xylophone?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.057
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.601
No, Lauren! Well, um..

13:34.855 --> 13:36.273
Hi.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.152
Hi.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.113
Um, you know what?
I've had a lovely evening.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.616
But I am gonna say goodnight.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.828
Goodnight!

13:49.912 --> 13:52.998
You are such a cool lady. Wait!

13:53.082 --> 13:54.750
When am I gonna see you again?

13:54.833 --> 13:58.128
Um, here's the thing, Charlie.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.381
How about I call you?

14:01.465 --> 14:02.758
Super.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.885
Wow, you know,
I'm just so excited

14:04.969 --> 14:07.096
that we got that first-date
thing out of the way.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.973
You know, now we can
let our guards down

14:09.056 --> 14:10.933
and really be ourselves.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.102
Boy, I hope you like
the real Charlie

14:13.185 --> 14:16.397
because the real Charlie
sure likes you.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.482
- Okay, goodnight, Charlie.
- Night.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.859
[instrumental music]

14:29.577 --> 14:31.453
[keys jingling]

14:39.253 --> 14:40.879
- Oh!
- Hey!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.590
- Hey.
- Oh, you're home.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.801
[chuckles]
Oh, just. Yeah, Charlie.

14:45.884 --> 14:50.848
Oh, he's so funny
and smart and romantic.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.642
The chemistry, whoo-hoo!

14:53.726 --> 14:55.311
Wow, oh, with all that chemistry

14:55.394 --> 14:56.770
it must have been some
kiss goodnight, huh?

14:56.854 --> 15:01.066
Oh, yeah. It was.
Fireworks, tingles.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.484
Tingles?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.154
Yep. It was hot.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.115
Really? What made it so hot?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.242
- Oh, you, you know.
- No, no.

15:10.326 --> 15:14.288
Was it the, uh,
the lips, the touch

15:14.371 --> 15:17.499
the way he looked at you
before he kissed you?

15:18.709 --> 15:21.253
Yeah, it was-it was,
uh, something like that.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.005
Mm.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.381
And, um..

15:24.465 --> 15:26.550
When your hair fell in your face

15:26.634 --> 15:30.137
did he brush it aside, so he
could see how beautiful you are

15:30.220 --> 15:32.765
like, like this?

15:32.848 --> 15:34.850
[whimpering]

15:37.728 --> 15:41.357
And then, um, did he
whisper in your ear..

15:41.440 --> 15:44.610
"When I get this close to you
I can barely catch my breath?"

15:44.693 --> 15:46.070
[chuckling]

15:46.153 --> 15:49.114
Yeah, he said
something like that.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.662
- My, God, you smell amazing.
- Hmm.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.206
He...didn't said that.

16:04.546 --> 16:08.008
Well, this Chuck sounds like
quite a find. Congrats, baby.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.762
[instrumental music]

16:11.845 --> 16:13.097
Goodnight.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.698
Whoo!

16:34.618 --> 16:35.828
Hi.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.790
Charlie, hi.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.584
W-what are you doing here?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.129
Smiling.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.755
I can't stop.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.174
Ever since we started dating.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.760
What are you doing here?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.888
Um, it got a little
hot in my apartment.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.849
You flatter me.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.102
- Uh, Charlie--
- It's fate, Val.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.438
Of all the places
in all the world..

17:02.521 --> 17:05.357
...how did the two of us
wind up here?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.651
I own this bakery.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.944
[chuckles]

17:09.028 --> 17:10.863
God, you're funny.

17:10.945 --> 17:14.616
That's one of the bazillion
things that I love about you.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.580
Here, I have something for you.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.292
- Oh, no, you don't, Charlie.
- Yeah.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.878
I wanted to wait to give it
to you on our second date.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.882
Who knew it would be
on the same night as our first?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.134
- Open it.
- Uh, Charlie, I--

17:32.217 --> 17:33.635
Open it!

17:34.970 --> 17:36.221
Okay.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.934
Charlie, this is
a diamond bracelet.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.480
I had a really
excellent time tonight.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.731
[chuckles]

17:47.107 --> 17:50.986
Charlie, uh, look,
the thing is I can't take this.

17:51.069 --> 17:54.031
You should save this
for someone really special.

17:54.114 --> 17:57.159
Someone you love
who loves you back, huh?

17:57.242 --> 17:58.869
I did.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.497
I'm sorry,
but I can't accept this.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.250
You have to, and you have to
put it on right now!

18:05.334 --> 18:07.669
Right now, right now, right now,
right now, right now!

18:07.753 --> 18:09.421
Okay, okay.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.173
Okay.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.259
See, I knew
you really wanted it.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.679
Oh, look.
Look how beautiful.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.518
It matches your eyes.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.146
You know,
if your eyes were $2700.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.318
Okay, uh, well,
thanks for the dinner

18:31.401 --> 18:33.529
and the bracelet here.

18:33.612 --> 18:37.574
I'm just gonna go
right back upstairs, okay?

18:37.658 --> 18:38.909
Bye.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.161
Bye.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.623
Yikes, almighty.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.836
So, you really don't trust me?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.254
How many times
are you gonna ask me?

18:50.337 --> 18:52.339
Until you trust me.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.216
I do.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.551
I mean, I thought I did.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.553
Until stupid Gary.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.096
Stupid Gary.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.141
Listen, maybe
I was getting scared

19:03.225 --> 19:04.643
that at the sign
of a first problem

19:04.726 --> 19:07.729
you're gonna go
running back to Henry or Ben

19:07.813 --> 19:09.523
or someone you met in Vermont.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.775
I'm not gonna meet
anyone in Vermont!

19:11.859 --> 19:16.071
[sighs]
Vince, I love you.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.240
[sighs]
I can't believe
you don't know that.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.701
And I love you, and I can't
believe you don't know that.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.786
Oh, it's just when I saw
those numbers of those girls

19:22.870 --> 19:25.455
in your phone, well,
it just brought me back

19:25.539 --> 19:28.500
to all those girls
in your phone.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.753
That was the old me thinking
that I was with the old you.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.423
But we're not
those people anymore.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.800
Those people must be eliminated.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.887
Listen..

19:39.970 --> 19:42.890
I understand why that ankle
bracelet means so much to you.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.225
I mean,
Henry was your first love.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.438
I never had
a first love...until you.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.566
So, keep it.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.778
I'm your first love?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.989
And hopefully my last.

19:59.072 --> 20:01.825
I can't keep going through this.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.703
Don't worry.
It can only get easier.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.124
God willing.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.129
[sighs]
And about the phone numbers..

20:14.212 --> 20:15.505
...go ahead and keep them.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.925
- Are you serious?
- No.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.301
Holly, I already deleted them.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.345
- Are you serious?
- No.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.350
Nana? It's Charlie.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.393
Of course,
she took the bracelet.

20:28.477 --> 20:33.357
And on Halloween,
I'm giving her the ring.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.150
[sobbing]
Oh, Nana..

20:35.233 --> 20:37.819
I've waited
for such a long time

20:37.903 --> 20:41.573
but I've finally found
the girl I'm gonna marry.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.866
[sobs]

20:42.950 --> 20:44.326
Okay, bye.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.834
