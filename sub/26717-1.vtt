WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.320
Previously on "Midnight Texas."

00:01.323 --> 00:03.289
The veil between Hell
and Midnight is fraying.

00:03.292 --> 00:04.296
There's a prophecy.

00:04.299 --> 00:06.031
"An army will rise to battle the evil

00:06.034 --> 00:07.343
and seal the veil forever."

00:07.346 --> 00:08.609
I know how to kill Colconnar.

00:08.612 --> 00:11.575
So you intend to be possessed
by multiple demonic spirits.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.125
This is over.

00:15.697 --> 00:16.929
- You're safe.
- We all are.

00:16.932 --> 00:18.565
Vampire blood's not good for humans,

00:18.568 --> 00:20.262
but I couldn't lose you, Olivia.

00:20.265 --> 00:22.067
It's time to exchange the rings.

00:22.070 --> 00:23.203
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

00:23.206 --> 00:25.343
- I want another century or two with you.
- Wanna go?

00:25.346 --> 00:27.306
As long as we come back before the cake.

00:27.309 --> 00:29.409
Being possessed by demons
could have side effects.

00:29.411 --> 00:30.622
The new owners of the hotel.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.840
This will completely
revitalize Midnight.

00:32.843 --> 00:34.915
That's one way to put it.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.919
Morning, sunshine. Here you go.

01:36.378 --> 01:37.664
Thank you.

01:37.667 --> 01:39.067
Did you have another bad dream?

01:39.070 --> 01:40.046
Yeah.

01:40.048 --> 01:42.115
Do you think maybe it's
time for you to invest

01:42.117 --> 01:45.291
in a new pillow or maybe
start taking melatonin?

01:45.294 --> 01:47.661
Yeah, or stop eating
burritos before bed.

01:47.664 --> 01:49.656
Mm-hmm.

01:49.658 --> 01:51.391
Or maybe it's time for a change.

01:51.393 --> 01:53.193
I've been taking stock lately.

01:53.195 --> 01:56.029
Yeah, dodging the apocalypse
will make you do that.

01:56.031 --> 01:59.900
Yeah, and since I've
had time to breathe now

01:59.902 --> 02:04.371
and think about Connor and my dad,

02:04.373 --> 02:06.536
I'm not sure that staying in Midnight

02:06.539 --> 02:08.842
is the best thing for me.

02:10.979 --> 02:12.579
Oh.

02:13.831 --> 02:15.914
You know how much I love you, right?

02:15.917 --> 02:19.686
Of course. I love you, too.

02:19.688 --> 02:22.188
And I really care about this town,

02:22.190 --> 02:25.292
and everybody in it.

02:25.294 --> 02:28.328
But I don't wanna be
serving patty melts forever.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.363
Yeah. Hmm.

02:30.365 --> 02:32.566
So, um...

02:32.568 --> 02:35.902
I applied to Bison's writing program.

02:35.904 --> 02:37.971
And it's... it's such a long shot.

02:37.973 --> 02:41.575
I probably won't even
get in, but if I do,

02:41.577 --> 02:44.678
I want you to come with me.

02:47.215 --> 02:48.281
Uh... um...

02:48.283 --> 02:50.328
That's a no.

02:53.855 --> 02:56.320
Home is wherever you are.

03:01.196 --> 03:05.148
Oh, your nose is bleeding.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.232
Oh.

04:06.294 --> 04:07.827
Sex magic's pretty hot, huh?

04:07.829 --> 04:10.664
Oh, beyond. You got skills, girl.

04:14.236 --> 04:18.438
To think a mere two months
ago I was pure as snow.

04:18.440 --> 04:22.007
How many frequent flier
miles do you think we banked?

04:22.010 --> 04:25.178
I think we're probably
approaching Elite Status.

04:25.180 --> 04:29.382
I bet I can get us over the, um, hump.

04:53.175 --> 04:55.742
Honey? I'm home.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.119
How was your hit?

05:06.121 --> 05:07.520
Killer.

05:07.522 --> 05:09.589
Good morning, wife.

05:09.591 --> 05:12.358
Good night, husband.

05:25.307 --> 05:27.674
How's the yoga?

05:27.676 --> 05:30.410
You know, I'm keeping my demons at bay.

05:31.487 --> 05:34.012
Think evil's finally taking
a break from Midnight?

05:34.015 --> 05:37.584
Babe, you just jinxed it.

06:01.910 --> 06:05.111
Take it...

06:09.284 --> 06:10.917
Manfred.

06:10.919 --> 06:13.578
Manfred!

06:13.581 --> 06:15.347
Do you want a refill?

06:15.350 --> 06:16.689
Uh, sorry.

06:16.691 --> 06:18.358
Yes. Yes, lots.

06:21.763 --> 06:22.953
Mmm.

06:22.956 --> 06:25.234
- It's not nearly as good as Madonna's.
- I know.

06:25.237 --> 06:28.167
I hope she's having fun on
her cruise while we all starve.

06:28.976 --> 06:30.270
That's like a hockey puck.

06:33.842 --> 06:37.577
Hate to disrupt our tasty breakfast.

06:37.579 --> 06:40.213
But we have business to discuss.

06:40.215 --> 06:43.122
Dug up some information
on the hotel renovation.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.285
Not sure why the cone of silence,

06:45.287 --> 06:48.254
but they didn't have a
web site until yesterday.

06:48.256 --> 06:52.075
And now it's some sort of
spa retreat thing called...

06:52.078 --> 06:55.278
Crystal Desert. That is my territory.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.247
Sorry, Fij.

06:57.249 --> 06:58.770
And get this.

06:58.773 --> 07:01.100
They're fully booked for the next month.

07:01.102 --> 07:02.368
Why so suspicious?

07:02.370 --> 07:03.937
Have you meet Olivia?

07:03.940 --> 07:05.638
Why would anyone wanna visit Midnight?

07:05.640 --> 07:08.187
I mean, it's not exactly
a tourist destination.

07:08.190 --> 07:11.074
Because of him.

07:11.077 --> 07:12.601
Healer Kai.

07:12.604 --> 07:14.797
Has a huge following of the desperate

07:14.799 --> 07:16.065
and delusional.

07:16.067 --> 07:18.461
Well, if it quacks like a cult...

07:18.464 --> 07:20.236
How do you know he's not legit?

07:20.238 --> 07:21.871
He's wearing Lululemon.

07:33.418 --> 07:35.268
You okay? You're quiet.

07:35.270 --> 07:38.488
Uh, I haven't been sleeping well.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.223
But don't worry about the hotel.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.458
It'll be out of business
in three months tops.

07:44.362 --> 07:46.262
Ghosts.

07:46.264 --> 07:49.265
Saw them when they
started the renovation.

07:49.267 --> 07:51.668
Haunted hotels don't
exactly rate well on Yelp.

07:53.271 --> 07:56.139
Yeah, well, ghosts or not,

07:56.141 --> 07:58.942
the eight of us are going
to that grand opening.

08:18.625 --> 08:24.032
_

08:40.318 --> 08:41.784
Hey, babe.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.456
You know what I would kill for?

08:49.227 --> 08:50.627
That.

08:50.629 --> 08:53.196
Exactly that.

08:54.547 --> 08:58.200
Well, I have to admit, this
whole psychic connection

08:58.203 --> 08:59.519
doesn't suck.

08:59.521 --> 09:02.155
One of the benefits
of drinking my blood.

09:02.157 --> 09:03.606
Mmm.

09:03.608 --> 09:05.308
How long did you say it would last?

09:05.310 --> 09:07.814
Oh, till death do us part.

09:09.864 --> 09:13.232
Well, I didn't think I
was the marrying type.

09:14.703 --> 09:18.938
But isn't this what every woman wants?

09:18.940 --> 09:23.109
For their man to know
her needs and desires...

09:23.111 --> 09:26.646
before she even does?

09:26.648 --> 09:29.916
But you're not every woman.

09:29.918 --> 09:31.918
True.

09:42.831 --> 09:46.332
Ooh, guess you knew I needed that, too.

10:26.207 --> 10:29.409
You're in trouble now, ain't you, Manny?

10:29.411 --> 10:30.476
Grandma?

10:35.482 --> 10:38.461
Grandma. That really you?

10:38.463 --> 10:39.916
Sure is, Manny.

10:39.919 --> 10:42.732
I'd hug you real big, if I could.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.557
I thought you'd crossed over.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.857
I did. That's why I look so good.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.873
Was resting in peace finally.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.075
And it was real nice, too.

10:53.077 --> 10:55.607
A home without wheels.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.647
RosÃ© all day.

10:57.649 --> 11:00.516
Canasta with Tammy Wynette.

11:00.518 --> 11:03.052
Then I heard about this.

11:03.054 --> 11:04.320
I don't get it.

11:04.322 --> 11:07.089
Uh, why at night?

11:07.091 --> 11:08.224
During the day, I'm fine.

11:08.226 --> 11:09.458
Well, mostly fine.

11:09.460 --> 11:15.097
Lately I've been, um, having some urges.

11:15.099 --> 11:19.001
Let's just say I shouldn't mix
loved ones and sharp objects.

11:19.003 --> 11:24.240
So the graves are for your friends?

11:24.242 --> 11:26.175
Eight of them.

11:26.177 --> 11:28.344
Guessing one for each Midnighter.

11:28.346 --> 11:30.746
Well, if that's the case,
then you should go back

11:30.748 --> 11:32.057
to town and tell everyone.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.016
No, no. I just got them to trust me.

11:34.018 --> 11:36.652
There... there's no way
I can tell them about this.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.954
Okay, fine.

11:38.956 --> 11:40.389
When did it start?

11:40.391 --> 11:42.224
Well, I thought they were just dreams

11:42.226 --> 11:43.893
until the other night.

11:43.895 --> 11:46.195
And the dreams started
right after Colconnar.

11:46.197 --> 11:48.297
You mean after your demon gang bang?

11:48.299 --> 11:50.966
It wasn't a gang bang, Grandma.

11:50.968 --> 11:53.102
Don't be embarrassed, son.

11:53.104 --> 11:56.038
You swallowed six whole demons.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.506
Took them like a champ.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.216
It's a point of pride, if you ask me.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.243
Will you please stop talking about this?

12:01.245 --> 12:05.548
The point is, maybe there's a straggler.

12:12.813 --> 12:15.924
If you're still possessed,
that holy water will burn

12:15.927 --> 12:17.660
your finger prints right off.

12:17.662 --> 12:20.663
Oh, great. That all?

12:23.801 --> 12:26.135
Okay.

12:26.137 --> 12:28.571
Oh.

12:31.075 --> 12:33.743
You're spick and span, son.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.981
So if I'm not still possessed,

12:38.983 --> 12:41.317
then what the hell is it?

12:45.790 --> 12:47.857
Hey. Hi, you.

12:47.859 --> 12:50.427
Great timing.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.362
Hipsters. In Midnight.

12:53.364 --> 12:55.898
And I thought Colconnar was bad.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.900
Let's try and keep an open mind.

13:04.942 --> 13:06.542
Feel that?

13:06.544 --> 13:08.927
The breeze, or the pretension?

13:08.930 --> 13:10.346
The energy.

13:10.348 --> 13:11.847
It's incredible.

13:14.619 --> 13:18.087
Are you kidding me?

13:18.089 --> 13:20.322
They're charging ten times what I do.

13:20.324 --> 13:22.358
You're in the crystal business, too?

13:22.360 --> 13:24.160
No. Yep. What?

13:24.162 --> 13:25.327
I'm, uh...

13:25.329 --> 13:27.463
Fiji owns The Inquiring Mind.

13:27.465 --> 13:29.622
- Hi, I'm Creek, by the way.
- Oh.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.301
This is Olivia and the
Reverend Emilio Sheehan.

13:32.303 --> 13:33.638
Please, call me Rev.

13:33.641 --> 13:34.677
Hello.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.669
I'm Patience Lucero.

13:36.672 --> 13:39.641
My husband Kai and I own the hotel.

13:39.644 --> 13:42.144
Y'all are very lucky.

13:42.146 --> 13:44.482
Midnight is a special place.

13:44.485 --> 13:46.348
Oh, yes, it is.

13:46.350 --> 13:49.285
You know, I'm just curious.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.553
Why here?

13:50.555 --> 13:53.055
Sleepy little town, no freeway exit.

13:53.057 --> 13:56.859
It seems like an odd
place to buy a hotel.

13:56.861 --> 13:59.260
To be honest, darling, before this

13:59.263 --> 14:01.997
we kind of functioned
as a traveling circus.

14:01.999 --> 14:05.716
Going from town to town. Healing people.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.528
But it was exhausting.

14:07.531 --> 14:09.971
Not to mention draining on Kai.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.607
So we decided that we needed
to find a spiritual center

14:13.610 --> 14:15.144
that we could call home.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.012
Rent too high in Sedona?

14:17.014 --> 14:21.065
Sedona doesn't hold a candle
to the energy in Midnight.

14:22.086 --> 14:24.353
- Can't argue with that.
- Mmm.

14:47.578 --> 14:49.958
Uh, I gotta get out of here.

14:49.961 --> 14:51.080
Work.

15:14.572 --> 15:16.372
Hidden platform.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.640
Mm.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.643
Welcome.

15:20.645 --> 15:22.945
And thank you, all of you, for coming.

15:22.947 --> 15:27.149
Today's... It's truly
an astonishing day.

15:27.151 --> 15:30.519
This is the realization
of a lifelong dream.

15:30.521 --> 15:32.321
A dream of... of helping people...

15:32.323 --> 15:33.689
Healer Kai.

15:33.691 --> 15:35.658
Make me walk, please.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.660
My daughter's getting
married next month.

15:37.662 --> 15:39.061
To walk her down the aisle...

15:39.063 --> 15:40.107
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.764
- I'd give anything.
- I'm sorry, sir.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.300
Um, we'd be happy to schedule
you an appointment later

15:44.302 --> 15:46.101
- in the week, but...
- Patience, Patience, it's...

15:46.103 --> 15:49.438
- Kai...
- All right, it's all right.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.041
Enter the pool.

15:52.043 --> 15:55.110
No, out of your chair and on your own.

16:00.985 --> 16:02.885
Oh, oh!

16:25.242 --> 16:26.875
Do you believe?

16:26.877 --> 16:28.310
Yes, I do.

16:43.661 --> 16:46.762
All right, now get up.

16:46.764 --> 16:49.732
Okay.

16:49.734 --> 16:52.501
Oh. Oh.

16:52.503 --> 16:53.636
Wow.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.937
Yes, yes!

16:54.939 --> 16:56.772
Rejoice!

16:56.774 --> 16:58.340
You are healed, brother!

16:58.342 --> 17:00.743
- Amazing.
- Yes.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.478
- Yes!
- Yes, yes.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.607
Thank you.

17:06.884 --> 17:09.050
If I'm not still possessed,
then it's gotta be

17:09.053 --> 17:10.005
a side effect from it.

17:10.008 --> 17:11.419
It's a good thing I was a pack rat

17:11.422 --> 17:13.856
and kept all these journals.

17:13.858 --> 17:16.858
Lord knows our family's
had its fair share

17:16.861 --> 17:18.694
of run-ins with demons.

17:18.695 --> 17:20.628
Sun's going down.

17:20.631 --> 17:21.653
I know.

17:21.656 --> 17:23.798
Bad things happen when night falls.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.166
I know.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.269
- Hey, Creek.
- Hey.

17:27.271 --> 17:31.774
I hate to say it but I don't
trust you around that girl.

17:32.410 --> 17:33.909
Me, neither.

17:40.284 --> 17:41.417
Hey, you're a natural.

17:41.419 --> 17:43.669
Heh, yeah. Bartending suits me.

17:43.672 --> 17:45.554
At least until I figure
out what I wanna do

17:45.556 --> 17:47.056
for the next 1,000 years.

17:47.058 --> 17:49.958
Come on, you like what
you see here, come on.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.260
Stop!

17:51.262 --> 17:53.328
Lem.

17:53.330 --> 17:54.846
Get out of here.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.433
First let me look at you.

17:57.435 --> 17:59.034
Come on. Just a little bit.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.804
- Let's go.
- Ah.

18:01.806 --> 18:03.205
Get out of here.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.744
I tell you, between
the pawn shop and here,

18:08.746 --> 18:10.869
you gotta be the hardest
working man in Midnight.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.200
Mm.

18:14.952 --> 18:17.677
I still can't believe
you took a watering hole

18:17.680 --> 18:19.922
from Nazis and turned it into Cheers.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.521
Well, I got a witch as a girlfriend now.

18:22.524 --> 18:23.625
Gotta walk the walk.

18:23.627 --> 18:26.562
Mm-hmm.

18:26.564 --> 18:30.299
So, I have a surprise.

18:30.301 --> 18:31.935
It's the key to my place.

18:31.938 --> 18:33.370
Whoa.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.975
Uh, too soon?

18:36.978 --> 18:38.940
Heck no.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.843
I was wondering what
you been waiting for.

18:40.845 --> 18:43.145
It's... the time just feels right.

18:45.483 --> 18:47.299
Chuy, he's a con man.

18:47.302 --> 18:50.419
And that guy in the wheelchair,
he's obviously a paid actor.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.221
It's the oldest trick in the book.

18:52.223 --> 18:53.789
So he's a con man.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.157
But maybe he's a harmless one.

18:55.159 --> 18:56.959
Uh, no such thing.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.027
People don't just
settle down in Midnight.

18:59.029 --> 19:01.113
They come here when
they're running from someone

19:01.115 --> 19:03.799
or they got something to hide.

19:07.388 --> 19:09.288
Watch where you're going, pal.

19:09.290 --> 19:10.989
Wanna take this outside, friend?

19:12.660 --> 19:14.793
Oh, I am not your friend.

19:16.304 --> 19:17.770
Thought I just got rid of you.

19:17.773 --> 19:20.264
Come on.

19:20.267 --> 19:22.634
Get out and stay out.

19:22.636 --> 19:25.370
Let go. Hey!

19:28.943 --> 19:33.145
I'm not so sure what good
getting tanked's gonna do you.

19:33.147 --> 19:35.948
Trust me.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.501
911. What's your emergency?

19:41.504 --> 19:45.224
Um, yeah, I'd like to
report, uh, a naked drunk guy

19:45.226 --> 19:47.726
outside the Cartoon Saloon.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.462
There isn't any naked drunk guy.

19:50.464 --> 19:51.663
There will be in a minute.

19:58.671 --> 20:03.341
Gotta admit, not a bad plan.

20:27.890 --> 20:31.058
Creek.

20:33.998 --> 20:35.307
Creek?

20:40.054 --> 20:42.722
Creek?

20:42.725 --> 20:44.366
Oh, my God.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.034
What did I do?

21:00.866 --> 21:02.199
Where the hell have you been?

21:02.201 --> 21:03.667
I left for work at 5:30 this morning

21:03.669 --> 21:05.068
and you weren't back yet.

21:05.070 --> 21:07.905
I ended up in the drunk tank in Davy.

21:07.907 --> 21:10.641
Blame Bobo's
Two-for-One Tuesdays.

21:10.643 --> 21:12.776
What is going on with you, Manfred?

21:12.778 --> 21:16.138
Lately you're not you.

21:16.141 --> 21:18.649
Nothing's going on. I was just drunk.

21:18.651 --> 21:22.085
And it's not gonna happen again.

21:22.087 --> 21:23.620
I promise.

21:23.622 --> 21:25.505
I wanna believe you.

21:25.507 --> 21:27.791
Really, I do.

21:27.793 --> 21:30.093
Because honestly I'm over the drama.

21:30.095 --> 21:31.261
I'm over the lies.

21:31.263 --> 21:35.065
I've had enough to last a lifetime.

21:35.067 --> 21:37.000
Um...

21:37.002 --> 21:38.635
Is this about Austin?

21:38.637 --> 21:42.039
Because if you have changed your mind,

21:42.041 --> 21:44.241
I would understand that.

21:50.082 --> 21:53.350
Take it...

21:53.352 --> 21:54.885
Manfred.

21:54.887 --> 21:56.987
It's... it's not about Austin.

21:56.989 --> 21:58.755
Austin sounds great.

22:03.329 --> 22:06.463
Uh, do you... do you
mind if we just talk

22:06.465 --> 22:07.998
about it later, though?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.168
Uh, I think I need to lie down.

22:11.170 --> 22:14.705
I'm still kind of hungover.

22:17.738 --> 22:19.472
Buckle your belt, hon.

22:19.475 --> 22:23.113
You're about to experience the
healing wonders of crystals.

22:23.115 --> 22:25.916
Can't hardly wait.

22:27.319 --> 22:28.852
All right.

22:28.854 --> 22:31.088
- Enjoy.
- Uh-huh.

22:52.311 --> 22:54.026
Can you believe this?

22:54.029 --> 22:56.780
This incredible place we found...

23:00.886 --> 23:03.420
This can be home for us right here.

23:05.057 --> 23:10.110
A long road to get here,
but we finally made it.

23:13.899 --> 23:18.802
I only ask this. Please
just give me strength.

23:25.210 --> 23:27.611
Any leads?

23:27.613 --> 23:29.100
Not really.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.530
Unless I wanna know how
to curse someone with gout.

23:36.105 --> 23:38.739
Interesting.

23:42.878 --> 23:45.237
Eww. That's...

23:45.240 --> 23:48.315
Exactly what's happening to me.

23:53.188 --> 23:56.256
Uncle Barney?

23:56.258 --> 23:58.458
Time for a family reunion.

24:02.831 --> 24:06.065
Hate to break it to you,
but even if you survive

24:06.068 --> 24:08.535
the possession, it comes at a cost.

24:08.537 --> 24:10.036
What's with the black crap?

24:10.038 --> 24:12.572
Demon residue.

24:12.574 --> 24:17.410
Left untreated, it takes
over the body cell by cell.

24:17.412 --> 24:20.925
So, demonic cancer?

24:20.928 --> 24:24.918
Once it reaches the brain,
you start hallucinating.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.990
And before long, you lose your mind.

24:29.992 --> 24:31.925
Okay.

24:31.927 --> 24:33.794
How do I stop it?

24:33.796 --> 24:35.996
Put a bullet through your brain.

24:39.434 --> 24:44.421
Before you put one
through someone else's.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.587
I like it.

25:00.589 --> 25:03.256
Damn it.

25:03.258 --> 25:04.291
What?

25:04.293 --> 25:06.927
Someone broke in.

25:06.929 --> 25:08.395
The money still there?

25:10.465 --> 25:14.117
Yep. All of it.

25:14.119 --> 25:16.236
What the hell they take, then?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.407
I'm screwed.

25:20.409 --> 25:21.975
Demon cancer.

25:24.596 --> 25:25.762
What the hell is that?

25:25.764 --> 25:27.047
Your booty.

25:27.049 --> 25:29.128
After you got out of the drunk tank,

25:29.131 --> 25:32.285
you broke into the pawn shop.

25:32.287 --> 25:34.725
That's... that's how I cut my hand.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.572
Maybe it is time to tell everyone.

25:52.574 --> 25:56.495
Or you could just give in to temptation.

25:56.498 --> 25:59.651
Might feel good to just let it out.

25:59.654 --> 26:01.448
I'd start with Creek.

26:01.450 --> 26:05.652
That skinny little thing'll
be easy to take out.

26:08.357 --> 26:09.589
Wait, wait, wait.

26:09.591 --> 26:11.258
This house is inhospitable to the dead.

26:11.260 --> 26:12.425
How are you here?

26:17.466 --> 26:20.533
You're not really here, are you?

26:30.445 --> 26:32.396
I'm hallucinating, aren't I?

26:36.351 --> 26:38.551
It's too late, isn't it?

26:38.553 --> 26:41.688
You always were a smart boy, Manny.

27:09.611 --> 27:11.645
It's not every day a demon like me

27:11.647 --> 27:13.496
gets to take out an angel.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.615
Hey, man, I'm not
looking for any trouble.

27:15.617 --> 27:17.617
Well, too bad. 'Cause I am.

27:22.324 --> 27:25.492
You're making this way too easy for me.

27:39.875 --> 27:42.108
Oh, look. It's a party.

27:48.951 --> 27:52.246
Now, that ain't a fair fight.

27:52.249 --> 27:54.215
You mind if I join you?

28:16.515 --> 28:17.785
Well, I'll be damned.

28:17.788 --> 28:19.048
Never thought I'd be in the trenches

28:19.050 --> 28:20.679
with the legendary Joe Strong.

28:22.851 --> 28:25.385
- I know you?
- Just a fan of your work.

28:25.387 --> 28:28.054
Name's Walker. Demon hunter.

28:28.056 --> 28:29.456
Are you human?

28:29.458 --> 28:30.624
Yep.

28:35.897 --> 28:38.064
Made it myself.

28:49.444 --> 28:51.544
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

28:53.048 --> 28:55.015
Likewise.

28:59.187 --> 29:00.487
Oh.

29:36.091 --> 29:37.757
Where do you think you're going?

29:39.249 --> 29:40.726
Just running out to the store.

29:40.729 --> 29:42.162
We're out of milk.

29:42.164 --> 29:45.565
Don't you wanna talk about Austin?

29:45.567 --> 29:49.024
Manfred? What has gotten into you?

29:49.027 --> 29:52.172
I don't know, I just have this, uh...

29:52.174 --> 29:55.608
This overwhelming desire to cut you.

29:55.610 --> 29:58.978
So sorry to burst your bubble
about moving to the big city.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.434
But, you know, you probably
would have ended up a waitress.

30:01.437 --> 30:02.676
Again.

30:02.679 --> 30:04.493
Just serving frito pies to D-bags

30:04.496 --> 30:08.348
and writing crappy poetry
that no one wants to read.

30:08.351 --> 30:10.123
I did you a favor.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.481
This isn't you.

30:11.484 --> 30:13.607
Oh, but it is.

30:21.103 --> 30:24.804
- One haunted katana.
- Check that.

30:24.806 --> 30:26.473
That's no missing samurai swords.

30:26.475 --> 30:29.409
Moving on to Civil War memorabilia.

30:33.804 --> 30:34.947
What's wrong?

30:35.784 --> 30:38.113
Creek! Oh, my goddess.

30:38.116 --> 30:39.980
Creek?

30:39.983 --> 30:41.749
Manfred!

30:44.126 --> 30:45.692
No one's here.

30:50.632 --> 30:53.016
Okay, tell me what happened again.

30:53.018 --> 30:56.319
Uh, we got into a fight and she...

30:56.321 --> 30:58.512
She hitched a ride to Blanco Canyon.

30:58.515 --> 31:01.316
She was acting crazy.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.909
Doesn't sound like Creek.

31:02.911 --> 31:08.681
I'm telling you, she's not herself.

31:18.977 --> 31:21.715
Creek?

31:21.718 --> 31:23.818
Where are you?

31:23.821 --> 31:26.081
Babe, are you okay?

31:26.084 --> 31:30.320
So she ran away to
the middle of nowhere.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.088
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Trust me.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.492
A lot of what Creek did
tonight doesn't make sense.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.394
Wait. Did you hear that?

31:45.804 --> 31:49.105
What's going on?

31:49.107 --> 31:51.674
Where's Creek?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.110
Ooh. Cute knife.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.554
It won't be so cute when
it crushes your trachea.

32:35.684 --> 32:38.084
I'm claustrophobic, you dick!

32:59.708 --> 33:01.107
Looking for these?

33:04.179 --> 33:07.080
Let go of me! Let go of me!

33:09.284 --> 33:10.550
Get off of me!

33:26.544 --> 33:30.003
Thank you. Thank you.

33:30.005 --> 33:32.906
How... how did you know?

33:32.908 --> 33:34.096
Psychic connection.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.308
Olivia's in danger.

33:35.310 --> 33:38.812
He got Olivia, too?

33:38.814 --> 33:42.249
He got lucky.

33:43.852 --> 33:48.955
Any fowl or evil force
may now and forever

33:48.957 --> 33:51.091
return to its source.

33:51.093 --> 33:52.659
Witch!

33:52.661 --> 33:54.761
Uh, you don't know any other spells?

33:54.763 --> 33:56.763
There's not really a spell for this.

33:56.765 --> 33:58.832
Uh, I wouldn't have even
recognized it as demon residue

33:58.834 --> 34:00.108
if it wasn't for Colconnar.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.658
I could research. But
that would take time.

34:03.661 --> 34:06.006
We don't have time. Look at him.

34:10.279 --> 34:12.178
Manfred. Manfred.

34:13.547 --> 34:15.893
If you're in there at all,

34:15.896 --> 34:18.885
I just want you to know that I love you.

34:26.128 --> 34:28.194
You have to kill me.

34:28.196 --> 34:31.797
Do it. Before I kill you.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.632
Please.

34:33.635 --> 34:34.833
Kill me!

34:34.835 --> 34:37.068
Now! Now!

34:37.071 --> 34:38.224
Now!

34:38.226 --> 34:40.068
No one's killing anyone.

34:40.071 --> 34:42.802
What are they doing here?

34:42.804 --> 34:44.143
I can help.

34:46.982 --> 34:48.783
Don't tell me you drank the Kool-Aid.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.116
I know you have doubts.

34:50.118 --> 34:51.384
But when I walked into Crystal Desert,

34:51.386 --> 34:52.918
I sensed it was a special place,

34:52.922 --> 34:54.554
that Kai was special.

34:54.556 --> 34:56.121
I just believed,

34:56.125 --> 34:58.291
and I think with an
open mind, you can too.

34:58.294 --> 35:01.614
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

35:01.617 --> 35:04.064
And you have no idea
what I've dealt with.

35:04.066 --> 35:06.232
Your friend is afflicted.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.734
And I'm afraid if I don't step in,

35:07.736 --> 35:09.069
he may die.

35:10.272 --> 35:12.405
Let me help you.

35:24.886 --> 35:27.320
Be at peace. Be at peace, brother.

36:11.867 --> 36:14.067
Oh, baby, you okay?

36:15.070 --> 36:17.003
And so it is done.

36:33.478 --> 36:35.565
I don't know what to say.

36:35.567 --> 36:36.999
Or how to thank you.

36:37.001 --> 36:39.769
I mean, I was gonna die.

36:39.771 --> 36:42.271
And you saved my life,

36:42.273 --> 36:43.449
and theirs.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.535
Well, you let us help,
and that's thanks enough.

36:45.538 --> 36:48.077
Mmm. Kai's right.

36:48.079 --> 36:50.847
We're just happy to
be a part of Midnight

36:50.849 --> 36:52.415
and call this place our home.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.717
Well, you certainly earned it.

36:54.719 --> 36:58.888
I hate to admit it, but
you're the real deal.

36:58.890 --> 37:02.121
You guys, I put you all in danger.

37:02.124 --> 37:04.332
I lied to you.

37:04.335 --> 37:06.002
I betrayed your trust.

37:06.005 --> 37:09.073
Which took me so long to earn.

37:09.076 --> 37:11.800
Because I didn't want to mess it up.

37:13.938 --> 37:15.262
But I was wrong.

37:15.265 --> 37:18.907
And I get it if you don't
ever wanna talk to me again.

37:18.910 --> 37:20.910
Manfred.

37:20.912 --> 37:22.311
You're not to blame.

37:22.313 --> 37:23.946
You weren't exactly yourself.

37:23.948 --> 37:26.916
Trust me. I understand.

37:26.918 --> 37:28.885
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

37:28.887 --> 37:32.455
The only reason this happened
is because you tried to save us

37:32.457 --> 37:33.621
from Colconnar.

37:33.624 --> 37:36.415
Just next time, just... you come to us.

37:36.418 --> 37:37.760
No next time, please.

37:43.201 --> 37:44.767
Where did Creek go?

37:51.476 --> 37:55.444
What... what's going on?

37:55.446 --> 37:58.781
Um, I'm going to Austin.

37:58.783 --> 38:00.750
Okay.

38:00.752 --> 38:05.354
But I thought we said we'd
talk about it some more first.

38:05.356 --> 38:07.156
See if you got into the program.

38:07.158 --> 38:10.393
Uh, yeah, at this point,
it doesn't even matter.

38:10.395 --> 38:13.563
I just gotta get out of here.

38:13.565 --> 38:15.631
Austin it is.

38:15.633 --> 38:18.134
I've been wanting to see
those bats on South Congress.

38:18.136 --> 38:22.738
You know, ordinary bats that
don't turn into vampires.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.807
Manfred, stop.

38:24.809 --> 38:27.143
Why? I wanna go.

38:27.145 --> 38:29.979
I told you. Home is wherever you are.

38:29.981 --> 38:31.514
I don't want you to come.

38:33.418 --> 38:35.051
I'm done.

38:35.053 --> 38:38.754
There's only so much
that a person can take

38:38.756 --> 38:40.389
until they've reached their limit,

38:40.391 --> 38:45.980
and I've reached my limit with Midnight

38:45.983 --> 38:47.363
and with you.

38:47.365 --> 38:48.793
But I'm... I'm fine now.

38:48.796 --> 38:51.948
I promise, I'm fine.

38:51.951 --> 38:54.018
How can you know that?

38:54.021 --> 38:56.793
No, that... that wasn't me. Okay?

38:56.796 --> 38:59.815
I... I would never hurt you.

38:59.818 --> 39:01.384
You gotta believe that.

39:01.387 --> 39:03.066
Huh?

39:05.717 --> 39:08.424
I... I've just...

39:08.427 --> 39:10.620
I've witnessed too much violence

39:10.623 --> 39:13.021
and I've had too much fear.

39:13.024 --> 39:16.926
And I'm sorry, but Kai
can't just kiss it better.

39:16.928 --> 39:19.996
I have to leave Midnight,
and I have to do it alone.

39:21.933 --> 39:25.668
But I love you.

39:25.670 --> 39:27.570
Then let me go.

40:01.239 --> 40:02.502
It's a big step.

40:02.505 --> 40:03.810
I know.

40:03.813 --> 40:05.382
Hear it's the gateway to marriage,

40:05.385 --> 40:10.079
babies, living happily ever after.

40:10.081 --> 40:12.348
You want all that?

40:12.350 --> 40:13.716
Why wouldn't I?

40:13.718 --> 40:17.219
You're my soul mate, Fiji Cavanaugh.

40:17.221 --> 40:19.255
And you're mine, Bobo Winthrop.

40:24.060 --> 40:25.361
Come here, you.

40:25.363 --> 40:27.396
Oh.

40:27.398 --> 40:30.499
Oh.

40:43.169 --> 40:45.247
Welcome home.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.120
I will avenge you.
