00:00.933 --> 00:03.434
- a small fading remnant
of a star.

00:03.501 --> 00:05.501
- a white dwarf.
- that's right!

00:05.567 --> 00:07.501
- i used a memory technique.

00:07.567 --> 00:08.900
dwarves hate being called
midgets,

00:08.967 --> 00:11.234
and midgets are small.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.667
- and...

00:12.734 --> 00:15.134
what does a star turn into
after it collapses?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.768
- a movie of the week.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.567
- black hole.
- right!

00:18.634 --> 00:20.634
troy! you could be
an astronomer.

00:20.701 --> 00:22.234
- as far as i'm concerned,

00:22.300 --> 00:26.000
there's only one black hole
worth studying.

00:26.067 --> 00:28.100
it's called sagittarius a,

00:28.167 --> 00:30.100
it's located in the center
of our galaxy,

00:30.167 --> 00:32.100
and it has the density
of 40 suns.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.334
just like my weiner.
- ha ha.

00:36.401 --> 00:38.501
you said weiner.
that's funny.

00:38.567 --> 00:40.200
- pierce and troy
didn't get along at first,

00:40.267 --> 00:42.200
but now they're bonding
through mutual adolescence.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.534
- shut up, boo-boo head.
- will you shut up, fart head?

00:44.601 --> 00:46.000
- hi, everybody.
[chuckles]

00:46.067 --> 00:48.601
well, look at this group
having some kind of meeting

00:48.667 --> 00:50.167
and being so diverse.

00:50.234 --> 00:51.801
there is just--boy!

00:51.868 --> 00:54.267
there is just one of
every kind of you, isn't there?

00:54.334 --> 00:55.634
- well, we are missing
a pipsqueak,

00:55.701 --> 00:57.134
but we don't want one,
so beat it.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.000
- um, pierce, that's the dean.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.434
- are you kidding?
- mm-mm.

01:01.501 --> 01:03.033
- sorry.
just my luck.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.601
- it's all right.
don't let me interrupt.

01:04.667 --> 01:08.033
sometimes i just roll around
campus like a little football.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.134
i can't believe this.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.134
here i am in a random
conversation about football,

01:13.200 --> 01:15.067
and i'm talking
to troy barnes,

01:15.134 --> 01:18.234
star quarterback
from riverside high...whoa.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.868
troy, did you know that
greendale has a football team?

01:20.933 --> 01:22.734
- did you know
they had a football?

01:22.801 --> 01:24.701
- ha. that's very funny.

01:24.768 --> 01:27.300
troy, i was so sorry
to hear about your injury.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.868
but now that you have
recovered,

01:28.933 --> 01:31.534
we would love for you to play
for the human beings.

01:31.601 --> 01:33.768
- the team's name
is the human beings?

01:33.834 --> 01:35.200
- yeah. my idea.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.667
it was
the greendale grizzlies,

01:36.734 --> 01:38.200
but i thought that, um...

01:38.267 --> 01:39.634
[softly]
well, a lot of these students

01:39.701 --> 01:41.567
have been called animals
their whole lives.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.367
unfortunately, i don't know
what to do about the mascot.

01:44.434 --> 01:46.033
- oh, i can help you
with that, your honor.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.601
i have
a wealth of experience

01:48.667 --> 01:50.200
in image management,
icon development,

01:50.267 --> 01:54.033
and y2k preparedness.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.701
troy, all of your friends
are lining up

01:55.768 --> 01:57.200
to turn greendale around.

01:57.267 --> 01:58.534
how about you?

01:58.601 --> 02:00.367
- troy isn't interested
in football anymore.

02:00.434 --> 02:01.834
getting injured
in that keg stand

02:01.900 --> 02:03.134
was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.334
- whoa! yoko ono much?

02:06.567 --> 02:08.967
bros before hoes, troy.

02:09.032 --> 02:10.467
- [chuckles]
listen, man.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.067
no offense,
but i was the best,

02:12.134 --> 02:13.768
and i finished on top.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.467
i wouldn't play for this school
with a 10-foot pole.

02:15.534 --> 02:18.033
- dean, i'm sure troy
will sign up for football

02:18.100 --> 02:20.067
if and when some accident

02:20.134 --> 02:22.834
damages the part of his brain
that feels pride.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.234
until then,
would you excuse us?

02:24.300 --> 02:26.601
- all right, well, uh...
if you change your mind,

02:26.667 --> 02:28.000
the field is always open.

02:28.067 --> 02:29.401
oh, figuratively speaking.

02:29.467 --> 02:30.834
you know,
wednesdays and sundays

02:30.900 --> 02:33.567
it's used as parking overflow
for the mega-church.

02:33.634 --> 02:35.067
okay.
[chuckles]

02:35.134 --> 02:36.900
- now let's meet
the minimum requirements

02:36.967 --> 02:38.667
for a language credit,
shall we?

02:38.734 --> 02:40.734
- yes, but i need to go
to the bathroom first.

02:40.801 --> 02:44.601
uh, britta?
- oh, no, i don't have to go.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.267
- i'll go with you.

02:50.267 --> 02:51.933
- what?
she's offended?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.768
- girls go in groups.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.434
did you learn nothing from
stand-up comedy in the '90s?

02:56.501 --> 02:58.434
- i'm familiar with the concept.
i'm just--[stammers] fine.

02:58.501 --> 03:01.200
if it's important to shirley,
i'll go with her next time.

03:01.267 --> 03:04.434
i'm willing to try some more
mainstream feminine stuff.

03:04.501 --> 03:07.801
- well, then you should know
that nothing says "i'm a woman"

03:07.868 --> 03:09.801
like doing it with me.

03:09.868 --> 03:12.267
- nothing says, "i'm a pig"
like you.

03:12.334 --> 03:15.033
- will they or won't they?
sexual tension.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.768
- abed, it makes the group
uncomfortable

03:16.834 --> 03:18.300
when you talk about us

03:18.367 --> 03:20.534
like we're characters
in a show you're watching.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.033
- well, that's sort of
my gimmick.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.634
but we did lean on that
pretty hard last week.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.367
i can lay low
for an episode.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.367
- * i can't count *

03:28.434 --> 03:31.300
* the reasons i should stay *

03:31.301 --> 03:34.553

03:34.734 --> 03:37.167
- you sure you made the right
call on the football team, troy?

03:37.234 --> 03:39.868
it looks like
they won something once.

03:39.933 --> 03:44.501
"most valued customer.
henderson trophy cases."

03:44.567 --> 03:45.868
- so we should still study

03:45.933 --> 03:47.601
a little more astronomy
later, right?

03:47.667 --> 03:50.467
maybe over some milky ways
or some mars bars.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.134
- or pancakes!

03:53.200 --> 03:56.801
- "i'm jeff. and i'm a student
at greendale."

03:56.868 --> 03:59.200
that's not good.

03:59.267 --> 04:02.200
- wood undergoes
rapid oxidation

04:02.267 --> 04:04.768
because it reacts
spontaneously to--

04:06.367 --> 04:08.434
okay, guys, seriously,
we've talked about this, okay?

04:08.501 --> 04:11.234
you have got to turn off
your cell--

04:12.501 --> 04:13.701
that's mine.
my bad.

04:13.768 --> 04:15.334
- [whispers]
i'm going to the bathroom.

04:15.401 --> 04:16.534
- hi!

04:16.601 --> 04:17.666
- would you like
to come with me?

04:17.733 --> 04:19.834
- well, yes, yes, i would.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.500
oh, that's nice!

04:21.567 --> 04:23.334
- okay, what's it called?

04:23.401 --> 04:25.167
antoni--an--hold on.

04:25.234 --> 04:27.667
does anyone have a pen?
pen?

04:27.734 --> 04:29.167
no one has a pen.

04:29.234 --> 04:31.067
why would you not bring
a pen to class?

04:31.134 --> 04:32.367
idiot.

04:32.434 --> 04:33.801
no, you're not an idiot.
[loud laugh]

04:33.868 --> 04:36.000
- i had my blinker on
about five minutes,

04:36.067 --> 04:37.501
and this no-good,
clearly bald

04:37.567 --> 04:38.933
but trying to hide it
with a bandana loser

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
swooped right in.
i couldn't believe it.

04:41.067 --> 04:43.033
- maybe he didn't see you.
- he saw me!

04:43.100 --> 04:45.200
- maybe he had
his blinker on too.

04:45.267 --> 04:48.267
- maybe. so you...
got any family, britta?

04:48.334 --> 04:50.234
- yeah, whatever.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.567
- think my mom might visit
this weekend.

04:52.634 --> 04:54.467
she and i are gonna get
makeovers at that spa--

04:54.534 --> 04:55.667
- makeovers.

04:55.734 --> 04:57.734
they sure have us programmed,
right?

04:57.801 --> 04:59.900
[robotic voice]
i am a female pleasure unit.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.567
i require a new
coat of paint.

05:02.634 --> 05:04.601
- just something
i thought might be fun.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.267
- here's something i think
might be fun.

05:06.334 --> 05:08.100
let's find out the number
of makeup companies

05:08.167 --> 05:09.868
that are owned by women.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.134
i'll save you the trouble.
it's zero.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.768
but of course you're saying,
"britta, aren't you a hypocrite?

05:14.834 --> 05:17.134
"you're plastered with glitter
and goo from head to toe,

05:17.200 --> 05:18.768
just like the rest of us."

05:18.834 --> 05:21.634
well, i also pay income tax
and pull over for cops,

05:21.701 --> 05:23.134
but that doesn't mean
i support--

05:23.200 --> 05:26.200
[hand dryer whirs loudly]

05:26.267 --> 05:28.701
- thanks for offering to help
design the new mascot.

05:28.768 --> 05:30.534
i, uh, have been
a little stumped.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.200
- that's no problem.

05:32.267 --> 05:33.501
by the way,
i took the liberty

05:33.567 --> 05:35.467
of thumbnailing
a human being prototype

05:35.534 --> 05:39.200
which i modeled after da vinci's
vitruvian man.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.534
- the penis is a little
small, i think.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.167
- oh, i think it's--
oh. okay.

05:44.234 --> 05:45.933
it...looks a lot like you.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.634
um, here's the thing.

05:47.701 --> 05:50.167
if we are the human beings,
you know,

05:50.234 --> 05:52.601
and we have a mascot
that's just a white guy,

05:52.667 --> 05:54.834
what message are we sending?

05:54.900 --> 05:57.200
our symbol needs to reflect
the diversity of our school

05:57.267 --> 05:58.868
and our species.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.634
- so...black?

06:00.701 --> 06:02.967
- no. no, because we're not
the greendale blacks,

06:03.033 --> 06:04.534
mr. hawthorne,
or the greendale asians

06:04.601 --> 06:06.167
or any other creed.

06:06.234 --> 06:08.267
we are the greendale
human beings.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.000
[knock on door]
yeah.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.768
- sorry to disturb you guys...

06:11.834 --> 06:14.100
who are clearly looking
at a naked drawing

06:14.167 --> 06:16.234
of pierce
doing jumping jacks.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.367
dean, a quick download, please?
- uh, absolutely.

06:18.434 --> 06:21.801
excuse me.
- okay. fill me in later.

06:21.868 --> 06:24.100
ah.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.967
whoa-oh.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.300
i'll go with a pencil.

06:28.367 --> 06:30.033
- first of all...
- mm-hmm.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.534
- i'm flattered.
- oh, well.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.967
you're a very photogenic man.

06:33.033 --> 06:35.067
is that real bed head, or do you
put something in there?

06:35.134 --> 06:37.000
can i?
oh, it's crispy.

06:37.067 --> 06:39.134
- i was thinking about the four
disembodied heads,

06:39.200 --> 06:40.401
and i thought,
where's the heart?

06:40.467 --> 06:41.801
where's the soul?

06:41.868 --> 06:44.334
where's the different
poster design?

06:44.401 --> 06:46.334
- you know, i did think
those were less than personable,

06:46.401 --> 06:49.167
which is why i went with
the full bodies

06:49.234 --> 06:50.967
in these mailers
we have going out.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.701
- mailers? i didn't give
permission for this.

06:55.768 --> 06:58.033
- jeffrey, did you not read
the release agreement

06:58.100 --> 06:59.401
on the back
of your registration form?

07:01.100 --> 07:03.567
<i>i'm starting to see why
someone used to be a lawyer.</i>

07:03.634 --> 07:04.900
ha ha! up top!

07:04.967 --> 07:07.200
- if someone from the outside
were to find--

07:07.267 --> 07:09.667
okay, if someone from
the outside were to find out

07:09.734 --> 07:12.134
that i am a student
at a community college,

07:12.200 --> 07:15.334
that could have a negative
impact on my future career.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.834
- oh. goodness.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.467
look what we have
stumbled onto--

07:20.534 --> 07:22.900
an opportunity
to help each other out.

07:22.967 --> 07:26.033
i suppose i wouldn't need
this promotional campaign

07:26.100 --> 07:27.434
if i could announce
to the press

07:27.501 --> 07:29.367
that troy barnes
is playing football here.

07:29.434 --> 07:31.033
- i think he's been
pretty clear

07:31.100 --> 07:32.734
about declining that offer.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.734
- i think if you said, "jump,"
he'd say, "how high?"

07:34.801 --> 07:36.933
if you said, "stop,"
he'd say, "hammertime."

07:37.000 --> 07:38.467
you starting to get
what i mean?

07:38.534 --> 07:41.000
- no. i need another example.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.067
- you know, i didn't...
realize before,

07:43.134 --> 07:45.634
but we should send those out
to local businesses.

07:45.701 --> 07:47.300
hmm?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.200
law firms.

07:49.267 --> 07:51.267
lawyer...

07:51.334 --> 07:54.000
companies?

07:54.067 --> 07:56.734
legal...

07:56.801 --> 07:58.401
gatherings?

07:58.467 --> 07:59.300
- are you trying to
blackmail me?

07:59.367 --> 08:00.300
- i think so.

08:00.367 --> 08:01.967
- gentlemen...

08:02.033 --> 08:05.701
i present to you
the greendale human being.

08:05.768 --> 08:08.933
- that's a falcon with a gun.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.401
now it's a falcon
with an erection.

09:04.768 --> 09:07.900
man, that backcountry today
was epic!

09:07.900 --> 09:09.534
well worth
the jellybeaning.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.534
blue bird day
to shred some pow.

09:11.534 --> 09:14.834
you remember that freshie pillow
line that we barged?

09:14.834 --> 09:16.534
i thought i was gonna squirrel
out for sure!

09:16.534 --> 09:18.534
you were squirrelly
all over the place.

09:18.534 --> 09:21.300
plus, you didn't even see
my switch back side rodeo.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.967
chill out knuckle dragger,
it's not all about you.

09:34.701 --> 09:38.467
the dome arrives later.
it comes with thunder.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.900
let me tell you a little
secret about me, troy.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.601
every day
on my way to school,

09:42.667 --> 09:45.334
i drive through downtown
past the courthouse

09:45.401 --> 09:48.100
just to get a glimpse
of the world that i once ruled.

09:48.167 --> 09:50.434
and i just wanna jump
out of my car,

09:50.501 --> 09:51.900
run up the steps and...

09:51.967 --> 09:53.667
exploit the legal system
for profit.

09:53.734 --> 09:54.900
but i can't.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.067
i'm locked out of
my old kingdom.

09:57.134 --> 09:59.601
you're not.
you see what i'm saying?

09:59.667 --> 10:02.067
- you're saying
i could be a lawyer.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.900
- i'm saying
you're a football player!

10:03.967 --> 10:05.567
it's in your blood!
- that's racist!

10:05.634 --> 10:07.134
- your soul.
- that's racist.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.401
- your eyes?
- that's gay?

10:08.467 --> 10:09.967
- that's homophobic.
- that's black.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.734
- that's racist!
- damn.

10:11.801 --> 10:13.933
- when you played,
you were a god.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.967
now you're not playing,
and you're not.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.300
i'd tell you to do the math,
but math isn't important.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.401
the only thing that's important
is this.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.100
- yeah, but annie said--

10:22.167 --> 10:24.200
<i>- annie said that
benjamin button was compelling.</i>

10:24.267 --> 10:26.501
look, she's a smart girl,
but sometimes she's just wrong.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.300
85--go long!

10:28.367 --> 10:30.367
it's like a drug, isn't it?

10:30.434 --> 10:33.868
feel it, troy.
throw it!

10:33.933 --> 10:35.367
the scoreboard lights up.

10:35.434 --> 10:37.134
there will be a scoreboard
there.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.734
it's complete!
nice catch!

10:39.801 --> 10:43.200
the girls, the glory,
the scouts, the career!

10:43.267 --> 10:45.868
it starts
when you join this team.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.567
- is that linebacker
a pregnant woman?

10:47.634 --> 10:49.033
- look,
you can meet them later.

10:49.100 --> 10:52.000
but this decision
has to be yours, t-bone.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.667
and this decision
has to be yes.

10:54.734 --> 10:56.267
- how did you know
my nickname's t-bone?

10:56.334 --> 10:58.134
- because you're
a football player,

10:58.200 --> 11:01.567
and your name
begins with "t."

11:01.634 --> 11:04.334
your name...begins...

11:04.401 --> 11:06.701
with "t."

11:09.768 --> 11:11.834
- britta?

11:11.900 --> 11:13.967
- oh. are you finished?

11:14.033 --> 11:15.601
i mean, i have to go,

11:15.667 --> 11:17.768
but apparently,
i failed yesterday's tryouts

11:17.834 --> 11:20.000
for the position
of bathroom companion.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.900
- oh, britta, i wasn't trying
to hurt your feelings.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.267
- you didn't hurt
my feelings, shirley.

11:24.334 --> 11:26.434
i don't need to go to
the bathroom with other people.

11:26.501 --> 11:28.601
i was just trying to throw you
a bone because i like you.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.167
- oh. you can keep that bone.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.300
listening to a story about
a stranger pissing me off

11:33.367 --> 11:34.701
and taking
the stranger's side?

11:34.768 --> 11:36.534
and then you can't talk
about your own business,

11:36.601 --> 11:38.134
but you insinuate
my mama's a robot

11:38.200 --> 11:39.801
because she and i
want makeovers.

11:39.868 --> 11:41.434
that is the ladies' room,
britta,

11:41.501 --> 11:43.868
a place where ladies
go to share, listen,

11:43.933 --> 11:47.234
support each other and...
discreetly eliminate waste.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.601
and i like you too.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.734
even like that
you're a little hard.

11:50.801 --> 11:53.367
but if you can't learn
to be soft in there,

11:53.434 --> 11:57.033
you need to pee alone.

11:57.100 --> 12:01.634
- i've peed alone
my whole life.

12:01.701 --> 12:04.200
women have always hated me.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.167
i don't even know
how it started.

12:06.234 --> 12:08.567
maybe it was when i got boobs
before everyb--

12:08.634 --> 12:10.868
- shh, shh, shh.

12:10.933 --> 12:13.234
not out here.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.768
in there.

12:15.834 --> 12:16.900
- whoo!

12:16.967 --> 12:18.634
ha ha!
troy, troy, the wonder boy!

12:18.701 --> 12:21.434
you dropped your books,
poindexter. yeah!

12:21.501 --> 12:23.967
- troy, i've been waiting
for an hour.

12:24.033 --> 12:27.267
- it's all right, i'm worth it.
* hip, hop, body don't stop *

12:33.300 --> 12:34.567
- troy.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.634
why are you doing
a politically conservative

12:36.701 --> 12:38.634
high school shamefully
outdated fight rap?

12:38.701 --> 12:40.701
have you been playing
football?

12:40.768 --> 12:42.134
- threw the skin around
a couple of times.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.300
still got it.

12:43.367 --> 12:44.300
eh...eh...eh...eh...

12:44.367 --> 12:45.734
doosh!

12:45.801 --> 12:48.868
- but you knew we had
an astronomy test tomorrow.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.267
- class blows.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.768
what i need to know
about the universe

12:51.834 --> 12:54.000
is that i'm at the center
of it.

12:58.601 --> 13:01.100
- troy! stop!

13:01.167 --> 13:02.868
don't become
this person again.

13:02.933 --> 13:04.501
this isn't the real you.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.501
this is the arrogant jock

13:06.567 --> 13:08.967
that totally ignored the only
people that truly liked him

13:09.033 --> 13:10.200
for non-superficial reasons

13:10.267 --> 13:11.501
but weren't allowed
to say anything

13:11.567 --> 13:13.701
because their parents
are bigots!

13:15.567 --> 13:19.634
- football is bad for you,
troy.

13:19.701 --> 13:21.334
- jeff said you'd say that.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.100
- jeff...what now?

13:24.167 --> 13:26.367
- troy!
troy, troy, troy.

13:26.434 --> 13:28.267
that's my name.

13:28.334 --> 13:32.134
- i think if we add in
a little bit of phylicia rashad

13:32.200 --> 13:33.567
we'll be in better shape.
- yeah, you're right.

13:33.634 --> 13:34.834
that beige is a little light.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.267
wow.

13:38.334 --> 13:39.701
- yeah. yeah.

13:39.768 --> 13:42.334
we are developing
the perfect mascot.

13:42.401 --> 13:46.234
no stereotypical identifiers
from any race or gender.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.300
- see, jeff, this is
a chart of the features

13:48.367 --> 13:50.601
we're staying away from--
pan-asian eye folds,

13:50.667 --> 13:53.334
irish chins,
women's breasts.

13:53.401 --> 13:56.634
- is that seal?
- that is our human color wheel.

13:56.701 --> 13:59.200
it goes from seal
to seal's teeth.

13:59.267 --> 14:00.967
- what do you think?

14:01.033 --> 14:03.467
- i think not being racist
is the new racism.

14:03.534 --> 14:06.134
- whoa, whoa, whoa--
what happened to the prototype?

14:06.200 --> 14:09.300
- ooh! i left the nose
in the kiln.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.234
- so...troy is gonna
play football.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.701
- yes!

14:13.768 --> 14:15.367
- which means i'll be getting
rid of these.

14:15.434 --> 14:18.167
- no. i won't mail these out,
but they are staying with me

14:18.234 --> 14:20.701
until the press announces
that troy is a part of the team.

14:20.768 --> 14:22.467
and i want him
at that pep rally tonight.

14:22.534 --> 14:24.401
reporters are gonna be there.

14:24.467 --> 14:27.067
we're gonna unveil
the new mascot.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.734
and things are finally going
to start turning around.

14:29.801 --> 14:32.367
oh, and...my ex-therapist

14:32.434 --> 14:35.667
is gonna think twice
before he makes fun of my job!

14:35.734 --> 14:37.067
- here it is.
still hot.

14:37.134 --> 14:38.734
- ooh. ow.

14:38.801 --> 14:40.434
- oh, dean, i'm gonna get
some more coffee.

14:40.501 --> 14:41.933
you want anything?
- oh, yeah, a desmond tutu

14:42.000 --> 14:43.801
with just enough cream to
make it a lou diamond phillips.

14:43.868 --> 14:45.634
<i>- la bamba.
got it.</i>

14:52.467 --> 14:53.967
i've been following you.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.868
how much did the dean pay you
to make troy play football?

14:55.933 --> 14:57.100
- i'm not having a conversation
with someone

14:57.167 --> 14:58.100
who emerges from a bush.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.634
- because i'm right?

14:59.701 --> 15:01.834
- no. because i'm not in a
commercial for breakfast cereal.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.501
look...the dean has pictures
of me, okay?

15:05.567 --> 15:07.501
horrible pictures of me...

15:07.567 --> 15:09.734
attending his school.

15:09.801 --> 15:11.634
- and for that
you'd convince troy

15:11.701 --> 15:13.834
to flush his life down
football's toilet again?

15:13.900 --> 15:16.300
britta's right, you are the most
selfish person alive!

15:16.367 --> 15:18.501
and all that
is gonna end right now.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.567
because i'm telling him what
kind of friend you really are.

15:20.634 --> 15:21.900
- maybe you should tell him

15:21.967 --> 15:24.367
you're hopelessly in love
with him.

15:24.434 --> 15:25.933
high school
must have been tough, huh?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.100
waiting for a superstar
to notice you.

15:28.167 --> 15:30.734
but here...here...
he's all alone,

15:30.801 --> 15:33.000
and he needs so much help!

15:33.067 --> 15:34.801
did you enroll
in all of his classes,

15:34.868 --> 15:37.267
or were you worried
that might freak him out?

15:37.334 --> 15:39.334
the important thing is that
you are there for him.

15:39.401 --> 15:42.634
the important thing is that you
are the only one there for him.

15:42.701 --> 15:44.401
and you don't really care
what he wants...

15:44.467 --> 15:45.667
just as long
as you don't have to

15:45.734 --> 15:47.534
share him with
the rest of the world.

15:47.601 --> 15:50.967
because, really, you are
just as selfish as i am.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.200
you're just not
as good at it yet.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.434
- you're right.

15:56.501 --> 15:58.734
i could never be
as good as you.

15:58.801 --> 16:00.801
probably because
i actually care.

16:00.868 --> 16:04.834
- profound, but technically
meaningless.

16:04.933 --> 16:07.300
and don't bother trying
that thing that women do

16:07.367 --> 16:10.167
where they walk away and make
the guy feel like crap,

16:10.234 --> 16:12.067
because it won't happen!

16:12.134 --> 16:14.100
yeah!

16:15.900 --> 16:18.401
damn it.

16:20.701 --> 16:23.334
- shirley, will you please come
to the bathroom with me?

16:31.067 --> 16:32.534
where's shirley?

16:32.601 --> 16:34.267
- shirley's not coming.

16:34.334 --> 16:35.900
but i'm here...

16:35.967 --> 16:40.634
to listen...girl.

16:40.701 --> 16:43.534
- why do we inflict
so much pain on ourselves

16:43.601 --> 16:45.601
for men?
- i don't--

16:45.667 --> 16:47.734
know...sweetie.

16:47.801 --> 16:53.467
maybe...it's because men
make the world go round?

16:53.534 --> 16:56.200
kleenex?

16:59.933 --> 17:01.701
i've been...

17:01.768 --> 17:03.534
infatuated with troy.

17:03.601 --> 17:05.900
now he's joining football.

17:05.967 --> 17:09.401
now he'll have
his pick of the litter and...

17:09.467 --> 17:11.634
i'll never get
to be with him! [sobbing]

17:11.701 --> 17:13.733
- oh, annie, screw him!

17:13.800 --> 17:17.000
there are guys out there
that would kill to be with you.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.367
and if troy
isn't one of them,

17:18.434 --> 17:20.032
that's him failing
your standards.

17:20.099 --> 17:22.701
you got that?

17:22.768 --> 17:24.367
- you're right.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.967
i can't control him.

17:26.032 --> 17:27.900
and if i truly cared
about him,

17:27.967 --> 17:32.734
i wouldn't want to.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.667
thanks for talking to me,
britta.

17:34.734 --> 17:37.267
it really helped.
- seriously?

17:37.334 --> 17:40.467
- yes.
- who's my girl?

17:42.567 --> 17:45.134
'scuse me!
- i did it, i did it!

17:45.200 --> 17:47.601
- oh, yes, you did!

17:54.501 --> 17:56.367
men chanting:
human beings, human beings!

17:56.434 --> 17:59.067
human beings,
human beings!

17:59.134 --> 18:01.467
- troy! troy!

18:01.534 --> 18:03.868
don't go in there, man.
- what?

18:03.933 --> 18:05.834
- you got the most you were
ever gonna get out of football

18:05.900 --> 18:07.134
in high school.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.933
a life of disillusionment
and depression

18:09.000 --> 18:10.634
begins on the other side
of that door.

18:10.701 --> 18:13.334
- hey, man...is this your
first pep rally or something?

18:13.401 --> 18:15.067
- you told me

18:15.134 --> 18:18.334
football was the most important
thing in the world.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.801
- well, buckle up, troy.
i was exaggerating.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.900
it's kinda my gimmick.
let me tell you something--

18:22.967 --> 18:24.367
- no, let me tell you
something.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.667
you know that keg flip
that cost me my scholarship?

18:26.734 --> 18:28.601
- yeah.

18:28.667 --> 18:31.467
- i hurt myself on purpose.
- what?

18:31.534 --> 18:33.634
- there was a scout coming
to the final game at riverside

18:33.701 --> 18:35.834
and...i couldn't
take the pressure,

18:35.900 --> 18:37.634
so i took the easy way out.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.401
but when you showed me
that field,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.434
i saw there was nothing
to worry about here.

18:42.501 --> 18:43.834
i could just play football
for the fun of it.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.167
i mean,
have you seen these guys?

18:45.234 --> 18:47.067
there is nowhere
to go but up.

18:47.134 --> 18:49.000
- dude, we have feelings.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.868
- i don't know about you,
but i know i ended up here

18:51.967 --> 18:56.401
because things weren't
that great out there.

18:56.467 --> 18:58.401
you should try accepting
where you're at, man.

18:58.467 --> 19:02.967
take a pottery class
or something.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.601
greendale, we're number one!

19:04.667 --> 19:07.434
nancy pelosi is no fun!

19:11.801 --> 19:14.868
- hey.
- hey.

19:16.567 --> 19:19.200
i've decided
to support troy.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.134
they deploy things
in football, right?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.534
i went for rhyme
over clarity.

19:22.601 --> 19:25.868
- look, i'm, uh...i'm really
sorry about before.

19:25.967 --> 19:27.701
i just think
we were both wrong.

19:27.768 --> 19:30.167
- really? because
i'm an 18-year-old girl,

19:30.234 --> 19:31.868
and you made me cry
in public.

19:31.933 --> 19:34.334
- mm. okay, maybe i was
a little more wrong.

19:34.401 --> 19:38.234
i should grow up
and make peace with being here.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.601
i mean, it's not like

19:39.667 --> 19:40.967
greendale's gonna kill me
or anything.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.667
- bluuulll...
- holy crap!

19:42.734 --> 19:44.434
- aah!
- oh, sorry.

19:44.501 --> 19:47.267
hey, say hello to our
ethnically neutral mascot--

19:47.334 --> 19:49.768
the greendale human being.

19:49.834 --> 19:52.100
the costume makes it
difficult for him to see.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.501
- he can't move his mouth
either.

19:55.567 --> 19:58.300
but take it from me,
that's human for "hello."

19:58.367 --> 20:00.534
[yelling] let's get you
into the pep rally!

20:00.601 --> 20:03.567
- great idea.
let's do it!

20:03.634 --> 20:05.100
we've solved racism.
what's next?

20:05.167 --> 20:07.300
- uh, let's do something
for little people.

20:07.367 --> 20:09.634
ooh! or albinos!
- little albinos.

20:09.701 --> 20:11.200
- this has the potential

20:11.267 --> 20:13.601
to be a uniquely
greendale experience.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.200
milady.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.401
- milord.
