So you can track
all the signals

08:56.623 --> 08:57.711
going out of the house
with this?

08:57.754 --> 08:59.451
- Even you could do that part.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.193
The trick is accessing
the signal and reversing it

09:02.237 --> 09:06.110
so we can see what
the kidnappers saw.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.590

it's from the wall

09:07.634 --> 09:09.157
opposite the door.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.724
- We have to assume
they're still watching.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.725

get in there

09:11.768 --> 09:14.423
without being seen?

09:14.466 --> 09:15.772
- Can you knock
the feed offline?

09:15.816 --> 09:18.296

Camera jammer.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.170
Don't move the camera.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.085

when you're done.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.574
When I was a cop in Indiana,

09:34.617 --> 09:36.663
I worked a kidnapping
with the Bureau.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.142
It's actually how
I ended up here.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.318
- Well, we found the kidnappers

09:40.362 --> 09:41.450
in under six hours,

09:41.493 --> 09:42.930
but the kid was already dead

09:42.973 --> 09:45.019

the ransom demand.

Gut feelings don't matter here.

investigating Senator Lynch.

think I'll let you

19:19.462 --> 19:20.898

19:20.942 --> 19:22.422

It's bigger than that.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.858
You haven't run it yet.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.468

"fake news" charge.

19:27.601 --> 19:31.387
- We'd like you to hold it.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.910

getting pressure

19:32.954 --> 19:34.477
to step on a story
about a U.S. senator?

19:34.521 --> 19:36.131
Because I can write
about that too.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.132

19:37.176 --> 19:38.481

the instructions on the call?

the modulation

it wasn't modulated.

The kidnapper
used a computer voice.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.498

The FBI.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.837
- You do know that
lying to an FBI agent

24:50.880 --> 24:54.014

- Yeah.

25:01.021 --> 25:03.153
I talked to her.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.242

good staff guy would do

25:05.286 --> 25:07.810
and covered the boss's ass.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.812
It was smart.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.292
You squashed the story
about the affair

25:11.335 --> 25:12.902
by giving her the kidnapping.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.600
Turned the scoop from being

25:14.643 --> 25:16.036
one that would have been
embarrassing

25:16.079 --> 25:17.603

told you about the affair,

you needed a distraction.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.353
So I kidnapped Gracie?

25:29.397 --> 25:31.268

25:47.807 --> 25:48.764
And how would I even know

25:48.808 --> 25:50.592
how to arrange a kidnapping?

25:50.636 --> 25:52.594
- I'm sure you know
people who do.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.161
Like who?

25:54.204 --> 25:55.597
- Senator Lynch's old friends.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.642
The ones you got rid of

25:56.685 --> 25:57.643

26:03.344 --> 26:05.259

We don't.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.827

26:15.661 --> 26:17.967

around all day

26:21.536 --> 26:23.190

26:29.370 --> 26:30.589

26:30.632 --> 26:32.329

26:34.941 --> 26:38.074
And you had somebody
threaten her.

26:41.034 --> 26:43.123

because she was broke.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.951
And I had a friend deliver it.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.562
- Yes.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.172
And maybe he went
a little overboard

26:49.216 --> 26:50.739

26:50.783 --> 26:52.959
we've been close friends

- I do, too.

41:20.608 --> 41:21.827
- Good night.

41:21.870 --> 41:25.657
- Oh, Agent Bell.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.397
Thank you.

41:27.441 --> 41:29.399
- Yeah, you're welcome.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.879
It was the whole team.

41:30.923 --> 41:34.579
But I'm so grateful
we found her.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.973
- The boy--
my husband's son, Nathan.

41:38.017 --> 41:40.846
What happens to him?

41:40.889 --> 41:43.413
- Well, he'll be put
in protective custody

41:43.457 --> 41:47.417
until Social Services
finds him a place to live.

41:51.117 --> 41:53.119
Oh.

41:58.124 --> 42:00.300
Yeah, I'm sure there's ways.
Oh, well...
