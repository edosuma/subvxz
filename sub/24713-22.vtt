WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:02.836
PREVIOUSLY ON "NYPD BLUE"...

00:03.628 --> 00:06.548
JOHNNY, I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
YOU'RE MY SON.

00:06.589 --> 00:07.882
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.718
CAN WE LEAVE IT AT THAT?

00:09.718 --> 00:11.261
OKAY.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.930
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET US
AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.891
HOWEVER LONG THIS LASTS,
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY IT.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.059
THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.613
CAN YOU STAY AWHILE?

00:31.573 --> 00:33.324
I'LL STAY AS LONG
AS YOU NEED.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.245
ME AND CONNIE ARE TAKING THEO TO
DISNEY WORLD,

00:37.662 --> 00:40.415
SO IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS,
ANY BALL-BUSTING,

00:40.498 --> 00:42.042
ANYBODY GOT A PROBLEM WITH IT,
GET IT OUT NOW.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.462
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:58.224 --> 01:01.102
WELCOME BACK, DETECTIVE.
HOW WAS THE TRIP?

01:01.102 --> 01:02.187
GOOD.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.730
DID THEO HAVE FUN?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.607
HE WANTED TO MOVE THERE.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.775
HERE. HE INSISTED.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.902
DON'T FEEL OBLIGATED
TO WEAR THEM.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.279
I HAVEN'T HAD MICKEY EARS
SINCE I WAS 4!

01:11.279 --> 01:12.906
THAT'S MOST RATIONAL PEOPLE.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.700
TELL THEO IT WAS SO SWEET OF HIM
TO THINK OF ME.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.453
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL WRITE HIM A NOTE.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.705
HE'LL GET A KICK
OUT OF THAT.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.083
UH, YOU CAN LOSE THE EARS
NOW.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.960
ANDY, WELCOME BACK. HOW WAS
YOUR TRIP?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.670
GOOD.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.214
I GOT THIS ON THE WAY IN --
MISSING KID.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.925
MOM'S AT THE APARTMENT --
1st AND 4th.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.051
WHERE'S McDOWELL?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.636
ON HER WAY IN, I GUESS.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.055
PAGE HER AND THE OTHERS. HAVE
THEM RESPOND.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.306
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.682
THANKS.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.935
THE MAN RETURNS.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.187
THUMBS UP, SIPOWICZ.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.232
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

01:47.232 --> 01:48.650
I DON'T KNOW, DETECTIVE.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.529
KEEP THOSE HID.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.832
HEY.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.336
WELCOME BACK. THANKS.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.629
HAD A GOOD TRIP?

02:09.629 --> 02:11.965
YEAH.
YOU TALK TO THE MOM?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.092
I JUST WALKED IN.
NAME'S CATHERINE LOWE.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.593
SON -- SCOTT, 12 YEARS OLD.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.388
HIS BED WASN'T SLEPT IN.
HE'S NEVER RUN AWAY BEFORE.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.057
ANY CHANCE HE MADE THE BED
AND DUCKED OUT EARLY?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.517
SHE SAYS IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.726
WHERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.937
JONES AND MEDAVOY STARTED A
SEARCH OF THE BUILDING.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.480
STILL WAITING ON McDOWELL AND
ORTIZ.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.401
DETECTIVES SIPOWICZ
AND CLARK, MRS. LOWE.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.444
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR SON?

02:33.444 --> 02:35.738
LAST NIGHT BEFORE I WENT OUT --
8:00, I GUESS.

02:35.738 --> 02:36.906
WHERE'D YOU GO?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.700
O'DELL'S -- MET MY
GIRLFRIENDS.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.368
WHAT TIME DID YOU
COME HOME?

02:40.368 --> 02:41.578
ABOUT 2:00.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.621
IT'S NORMAL YOU DON'T CHECK ON
HIM?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.039
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE HIM.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.667
WERE YOU IN ANY KIND OF
ARGUMENT WITH YOUR SON?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.002
WAS HE BEING DISCIPLINED?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.211
NO.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.172
HE'S DRINKING OR DOING
DRUGS AT ALL?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.674
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
HE'S A COMPUTER KID.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.968
DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ACCESS TO
YOUR PLACE?

02:56.968 --> 02:59.762
IS THERE ANYPLACE YOU CAN THINK
OF HE MIGHT HAVE GONE?

02:59.762 --> 03:02.432
MAYBE HE'S AT THE DWYERS'.
MAYBE HIS FATHER TOOK HIM.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.310
I DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE NOBODY'S
ANSWERING THEIR DAMN PHONE.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.562
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.
WHERE'S HIS FATHER LIVE?

03:07.562 --> 03:08.730
PARK SLOPE.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.733
IF HE TOOK SCOTT, YOU TELL HIM I
WILL KILL HIM.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.735
SO THINGS AREN'T GOOD
BETWEEN YOU?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.069
A BAD DIVORCE.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.404
AND THE DWYERS?

03:16.404 --> 03:18.698
THAT'S SCOTT'S FRIEND JAKE.
THEY LIVE NEARBY.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.701
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE DOWN THEIR
PHONE AND ADDRESS --

03:21.701 --> 03:23.036
THE DWYERS AND YOUR EX?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.663
AND ANY OTHER PLACE
YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.290
LET'S CATCH UP McDOWELL.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.959
HEY.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.502
CONNIE, WELCOME BACK.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.296
THANKS.
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.049
KID'S NEVER RUN OFF.
THEY WEREN'T IN A FIGHT.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.052
AND CAN'T FIND THE DIVORCED DAD.
HE'S FIRST STOP.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.888
MEANTIME, GET UNIFORM ON
SEARCHING THE AREA --

03:41.888 --> 03:43.306
VACANT LOTS, BASEMENTS.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.432
WE'D BETTER, YEAH.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.520
WHAT IS IT, PAL?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.064
HOW WAS FLORIDA?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.857
SO THE WORLD KNOWS?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.025
GOT AROUND.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.027
FLORIDA WAS FINE, PAL.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.612
NOW EXPLAIN THAT SMIRK.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.532
ANDY...YOU'RE MY HERO.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.443
ANYTHING?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.403
NO ONE IN THE AREA
HAD SEEN THE KID.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.114
NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS SAW
ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.615
ANY LUCK FINDING
THE DAD?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.326
NO ONE ANSWERED
AT HIS HOUSE,

05:26.326 --> 05:28.619
AND APPARENTLY,
HE'S TAKING A DAY OFF WORK.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.330
PLANNED OR
UR-OF-THE-MOMENT?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.998
PUT IN FOR IT
TWO WEEKS AGO.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.958
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO HIS
CO-WORKERS.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.168
TOMMY DWYER.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.963
I GOT A MESSAGE TO SEE
DETECTIVES CLARK OR SIPOWICZ.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.716
YEAH -- ANDY SIPOWICZ.
JOHN CLARK.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.259
LET'S TALK BACK HERE.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.055
DAD OF THE MISSING KID'S
FRIEND.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.724
SO THE MISSING KID'S FATHER'S
YOUR ANGLE?
FOR NOW.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.727
I DON'T GOTTA TELL YOU WE GOTTA
COVER THESE BASES IN A HURRY.

05:52.727 --> 05:53.770
NO, YOU DON'T.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.066
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE THIS QUICK --

05:58.066 --> 05:59.734
WITH A MISSING KID
AND ALL.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.862
I KNOW. I WAS JUST TELLING HIM.
I'M RETIRED OFF THE JOB.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.030
20 YEARS, HIGHWAY 1.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.865
YOUR SON AND SCOTT
ARE FRIENDS?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.158
SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.035
HE SPEND TIME AT YOUR
APARTMENT?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.203
YEAH, HE COMES OVER.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.163
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

06:12.163 --> 06:14.791
TWO DAYS AGO. ARE YOU THINKING
HE WAS KIDNAPPED?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.751
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO PUT IT
TOGETHER.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.002
HE SAYS HE COMES OVER.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.129
DOES THAT MEAN YOUR SON AND
SCOTT ARE CLOSE,

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
OR ARE THEY JUST PALS?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.423
FAIRLY CLOSE, I GUESS.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.133
ANY CHANCE
THEY'RE TOGETHER NOW?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.301
NO. JAKE'S AT SCHOOL.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.137
I CHECKED UP
AFTER I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.640
YOU'RE NOT THINKING THIS IS
WORSE THAN KIDNAPPING.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.475
WE'RE JUST GETTING
OFF THE GROUND.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.477
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT SCOTT'S FAMILY?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.145
UH...THE MOM'S
A LITTLE ROUGH.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.731
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO SAY
NOTHING BAD AGAINST HER.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.899
HEY, A KID IS MISSING.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.651
YOU GOT SOMETHING,
LET'S HEAR IT.

06:41.651 --> 06:45.655
SCOTT WASN'T EXACTLY THRILLED
WITH HIS HOME LIFE.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.864
SPECIFICALLY?

06:46.864 --> 06:48.324
CATHY ISN'T AROUND A LOT,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.493
AND HER ATTENTIONS
ARE ON OTHER THINGS --

06:50.493 --> 06:52.203
YOU KNOW,
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.163
SCOTT WANTED TO LIVE
WITH HIS DAD.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.331
YEAH, WE HEARD THAT.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.583
BUT I THINK HE WAS READY
TO MAKE THE JUMP

06:57.583 --> 06:59.544
AND HIS DAD
WAS READY TO TAKE HIM.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.962
SCOTT TOLD YOU THIS?

07:00.962 --> 07:03.423
HE DIDN'T HAVE A DAD AT HOME,
SO HE TALKED TO ME.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.133
HE LAY OUT
ANY KIND OF PLAN?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.009
HE REALLY WANTED TO LIVE
WITH HIS DAD,

07:07.009 --> 07:08.970
AND HIS DAD REALLY WANTED
TO TAKE HIM,

07:08.970 --> 07:10.847
AND ONE DAY SOON,
IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.932
HAVE YOU TALKED TO JIM YET --
SCOTT'S DAD?

07:12.932 --> 07:14.642
CAN'T FIND HIM AT HOME
OR AT WORK.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.310
YOU GOT SOMEPLACE ELSE
TO LOOK?

07:16.310 --> 07:18.312
SCOTT MENTIONED
HE PLAYS A LOT OF GOLF

07:18.312 --> 07:19.981
AT A COUNTRY CLUB
IN RIVERDALE.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.358
HE'S GONNA KIDNAP
HIS KID AND PLAY GOLF.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.068
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.695
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.366
[ EXHALES DEEPLY ]

07:32.577 --> 07:35.621
HE AIMED IT AT THE DAD --
CUSTODIAL INTERFERENCE.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
DO WE HAVE A PLACE
TO LOOK?

07:37.498 --> 07:40.418
A WEAK POSSIBLE, BUT IT MIGHT GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.503
WE'RE ON THE AIR.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.424
MAN DOWNSTAIRS SAID TO TALK
TO A DETECTIVE.

07:46.424 --> 07:47.884
REGARDING WHAT, SIR?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.511
I THINK I HAVE A SUSPECT IN
YOUR MISSING-CHILD CASE.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.222
HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON
A MISSING-CHILD CASE?

07:53.222 --> 07:54.932
I MONITOR
THE POLICE FREQUENCY.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.351
WHERE'D YOU FIND
THIS SUSPECT? THE
INTERNET.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.187
THESE DETECTIVES
WILL TALK TO YOU.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.566
IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN IT,
CALL ANDY AND JOHN.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.026
IF NOT, SEND HIM HOME.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.819
COME ON IN. YOUR NAME?

08:06.819 --> 08:07.862
TED MUNTZ.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.698
HAVE A SEAT.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.700
SO, WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR US, TED?

08:12.700 --> 08:15.536
THESE ARE PRINTOUTS
OF 31 E-MAILS BETWEEN MYSELF

08:15.536 --> 08:18.664
AND AN INDIVIDUAL WHO REFERS TO
HIMSELF AS "FUNTIMES65,"

08:18.664 --> 08:20.082
WHICH IS REPREHENSIBLE,

08:20.082 --> 08:22.668
CONSIDERING WHAT A FOUL-MINDED
PERSON HE IS.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.588
MR. MUNTZ, WE NEED TO ASK YOU
TO CUT TO THE CHASE.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.341
FIRST, I NEED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT A BOY I KNOW --

08:28.341 --> 08:30.551
AARON NESTER --
SCREEN NAME AARON21.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.011
AARON IS 15 YEARS OLD.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.305
HE ATTENDS MT. JEFFERSON HIGH
IN NEW JERSEY.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.766
HE'S IN THE THEATER CLUB,
RUNS CROSS-COUNTRY,

08:36.766 --> 08:39.477
AND HE'S DESPERATELY CONFUSED
ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.854
THING ABOUT AARON THAT'S SO
INTERESTING IS

08:41.854 --> 08:42.980
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.066
MR. MUNTZ, YOU'VE GOT
ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.150
AARON NESTER IS ME.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.194
I GO INTO YOUTH-ORIENTED
CHAT ROOMS,

08:48.194 --> 08:50.905
DISGUISED AS AARON, AND
ROOT OUT ONLINE PEDOPHILES.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.365
THIS IS A HOBBY?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.033
I DO TECH SUPPORT,
SO I'M HOME ALL DAY.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.077
I'M JUST MAKING USE
OF MY DOWNTIME.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.663
HAVE YOU BEEN SUCCESSFUL?
HAVE THERE BEEN ARRESTS?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.164
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.832
SO, WHAT DO YOU GOT,
TED?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.834
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

09:03.834 --> 09:05.962
THIS FUNTIME LURED AARON
INTO A PRIVATE CHAT ROOM

09:05.962 --> 09:08.839
AND STARTED GRILLING HIM ABOUT
WAS HE A VIRGIN,

09:08.839 --> 09:10.925
HAD HE EVER HAD
A GAY EXPERIENCE

09:10.925 --> 09:13.636
OR FANTASIZED ABOUT BOYS
IN THE LOCKER ROOM,

09:13.636 --> 09:16.055
UNTIL FUNTIME ESSENTIALLY
SEDUCED AARON

09:16.055 --> 09:17.974
INTO FULL-FLEDGED
ONLINE SEX.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.892
ALL PART OF
YOUR CIVIC DUTY.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.769
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET PAST
ANONYMITY,

09:21.769 --> 09:24.230
YOU HAVE TO GAIN TRUST.
DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.899
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK FUNTIME
HAS TO DO WITH OUR CASE?

09:26.899 --> 09:29.402
HE'S MADE NUMEROUS REFERENCES TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

09:29.402 --> 09:32.822
SO I'M ALMOST CERTAIN HE LIVES
NEAR YOUR MISSING BOY.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.616
HE SAYS HE'S GUIDED OTHER BOYS
INTO THEIR HOMOSEXUALITY

09:35.616 --> 09:37.451
BY HAVING FACE-TO-FACE
MEETINGS --

09:37.451 --> 09:39.870
SOMETHING HE'S BEEN TRYING TO
ARRANGE WITH AARON

09:39.870 --> 09:41.122
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.748
AND HE REPEATEDLY TELLS
AARON

09:42.748 --> 09:45.751
HE KNOWS OF A PLACE WHERE HE CAN
EXPRESS HIMSELF SEXUALLY

09:45.751 --> 09:47.712
AND FINALLY BE FREE FROM
CONFUSION.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.339
I MEAN, HE LIVES HERE,
HE'S PICKING UP BOYS HERE.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.757
THAT'S TWO AND TWO, RIGHT?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.343
IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.137
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO
ARRANGE A MEETING WITH THIS GUY?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.014
HE TELLS AARON ANYPLACE,
ANYTIME.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.473
FROM WHAT HE'S MENTIONED,

09:59.473 --> 10:02.101
HE WORKS AT HOME AND LIVES NEAR
A VIDEO-GAME ARCADE,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.103
SO ALL AARON HAS TO DO
IS PAGE HIM.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.063
HE PROVIDED THE NUMBER
TWO WEEKS AGO,

10:06.063 --> 10:08.232
AND WITHIN HALF AN HOUR,
THE MEETING'S ON.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.067
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN HE CALLS BACK --

10:10.067 --> 10:12.403
YOU TALK LIKE A 15-YEAR-OLD,
RAISE YOUR VOICE?

10:12.403 --> 10:14.614
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN AS FAR AS
MEETING ANYONE,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.532
SO I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
THAT FAR AHEAD.

10:16.532 --> 10:19.201
IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF PRANK,
TELL US NOW.

10:19.201 --> 10:22.830
'CAUSE DOWN THE LINE
I FIND OUT YOU'RE LYING,
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.498
JAIL?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.500
I CAME HERE TO HELP.
IT'S THE TRUTH.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.586
GET A FEMALE IN ANTICRIME
OR A UNIFORM,

10:28.586 --> 10:31.088
SOMEONE WITH A KID'S VOICE
TO ANSWER THE PHONE

10:31.088 --> 10:32.465
WHEN THIS GUY CALLS BACK.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.966
PAGE HIM NOW.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.301
COME WITH US.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.867
DOWN THIS AISLE,
GREEN HAT AND JACKET.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.744
I JUST PAGED THE NUMBER
AGAIN

11:01.744 --> 11:03.621
TO SEE IF IT'S OUR GUY.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.752
POLICE.
YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.837
I THINK YOU GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.466
YEAH? WELL, WHAT'S MY DATE OF
BIRTH DOING ON YOUR PAGER?

11:15.466 --> 11:16.801
SAY ONE MORE THING,

11:16.801 --> 11:19.303
YOU'LL BE ON THE GROUND IN
HANDCUFFS.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.597
DID YOU COME HERE
WITH HIM?

11:21.597 --> 11:22.932
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.476
THEN GET YOUR BUTT TO
SCHOOL.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.659
SIT DOWN, MR. VOLNEY.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.993
NO, I'LL STAND

11:42.993 --> 11:45.538
UNTIL ONE OF YOU THUGS TELLS ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.373
HEY, WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.208
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT THE ARCADE?

11:49.208 --> 11:51.794
I WAS PLAYING SOME GAMES,
WASTING TIME.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.504
YOU WEREN'T KEEPING
AN APPOINTMENT?

11:53.504 --> 11:54.672
NO.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.341
HOW DO YOU THINK
WE GOT YOUR PAGER NUMBER?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.342
I GOT NO IDEA.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.969
YOU GOOD WITH COMPUTERS?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.929
I DESIGN WEBSITES,
SO, YEAH.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.931
WHAT'S YOUR HANDLE
IN THE CHAT ROOMS?

12:03.931 --> 12:05.433
GANDALF77.
WHAT THE HELL?

12:05.433 --> 12:07.935
YOU GOT ANOTHER NAME
YOU GO BY -- MAYBE FUNTIME?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.270
NO.

12:09.270 --> 12:13.065
VOLNEY, IF YOU THINK ALL COPS
ARE COMPUTER-ILLITERATE MOPES,

12:13.065 --> 12:14.400
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU

12:14.400 --> 12:17.236
THERE ARE WHOLE DIVISIONS
OF THE DEPARTMENT

12:17.236 --> 12:19.697
DEVOTED TO PORING
THROUGH COMPUTERS.

12:19.697 --> 12:23.159
THEY'LL QUICKLY PROVE THAT
YOUR SCREEN NAME IS FUNTIME.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.702
ALL RIGHT, SO -- SO WHAT?

12:24.702 --> 12:28.122
WERE YOU IN THE ARCADE TO MEET
SOMEONE NAMED AARON NESTER?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.206
WHAT IF I WAS?

12:29.206 --> 12:31.625
AND NO ONE TOLD YOU
PEDOPHILIA'S A CRIME?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.586
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
PEDOPHILIA?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.046
I WAS THERE TO MEET A
FULLY GROWN MAN.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.591
WE GOT PRINTOUTS
OF YOUR CHATS WITH AARON.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.050
HE MAKES HIS AGE CLEAR.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.344
IT'S CALLED "AGE PLAY."
IT'S PRETEND.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.679
AGE PLAY, HUH?

12:43.679 --> 12:46.640
I GOT FANTASIES, ALL RIGHT?
SO DO OTHER GUYS, LOTS OF THEM.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.852
SO SOMEONE PRETENDS THEY'RE
A YOUNG KID AND YOU HOOK UP.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.063
CHECK YOUR TRANSCRIPTS.
THIS AARON WRITES LIKE HE'S 40.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.065
HIS POP REFERENCES ARE ALL
FORCED.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.067
HIS PERSONALITY
IS TOTAL CLICHE.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.737
PLUS, I MADE NUMEROUS REFERENCES
TO AGE PLAY.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.615
YOU EVER CHAT ONLINE
WITH A KID NAME SCOTT LOWE?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.200
NO. NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.910
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

13:05.910 --> 13:07.244
I WAS HOME WORKING.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.914
WERE YOU ANYWHERE NEAR
1st AVENUE AND 4th STREET?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.081
I WAS HOME WORKING.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.166
PROVE IT.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.250
OH...

13:13.250 --> 13:15.753
[ SIGHS ]

13:15.753 --> 13:17.630
THERE'S AN AUTOLOG ON MY
COMPUTER

13:17.630 --> 13:19.131
THAT I USE TO BILL CLIENTS.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.050
THAT'LL SAY
WHEN I WAS WORKING.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
WE'LL NEED YOUR COMPUTER. HELL
NO.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.470
WE'LL GET A SUBPOENA
FOR IT.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.971
YOU'RE STICKING AROUND.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.601
THE FATHER?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
WASN'T AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

13:32.478 --> 13:36.106
ONE OF HIS GOLF BUDDIES SAYS
HE GOES FISHING LOCALLY.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.733
WE'LL MAKE CALLS ON IT.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.901
WE GET PORT AUTHORITY

13:38.901 --> 13:40.110
ON THE AIRPORTS
AND THE BUS TERMINALS?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.821
AND EMPTY ON THE RAILS.
I MADE ALL THE CALLS.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.614
HOW'D McDOWELL AND RITA DO
WITH HIS CO-WORKERS?

13:43.614 --> 13:44.615
NOTHING.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.741
IT'S ABOUT TIME

13:45.741 --> 13:48.369
TO GET THE AVIATION
TO CHECK ON THE ROOFTOPS

13:48.369 --> 13:50.287
AND HARBOR
ON THE SHORELINE.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.456
AS LONG AS THE DAD'S
IN THE WIND,

13:52.456 --> 13:54.500
WE PLAY LIKE
THE KID'S MISSING.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.460
THAT DOESN'T LAST
MUCH LONGER.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.254
WHO WERE YOU IN WITH?
INTERNET GUY.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.464
HE'S HALF-WACKY
BUT CLAIMS HE'S GOT AN ALIBI.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.383
WE NEED A SUBPOENA
FOR HIS COMPUTER.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.426
HAYWOOD'S IN ANTICRIME.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.929
DETECTIVE, IT'S SCOTT LOWE'S
FATHER.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.556
GOT IT.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.475
YEAH. DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

14:11.475 --> 14:14.353
MR. LOWE, WE NEED TO SEE YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.564
NO, WE HAVEN'T FOUND HIM
YET.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.107
WHERE CAN WE GET YOU?

14:18.107 --> 14:19.483
THAT'S FINE.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.403
HE'S NEARBY.
HE'S COMING IN.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.488
KEEP WORKING YOUR GUY.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.241
I GOT IT.

14:27.241 --> 14:31.203
15th SQUAD.
SIPOWICZ SPEAKING.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.163
AH, STICK IT IN YOUR ASS.

14:33.163 --> 14:35.708
THESE ASSHOLE UNIFORM GOT
NOTHING BETTER TO DO

14:35.708 --> 14:37.418
THAN, "ANDY,
YOU'RE THE MAN."

14:37.418 --> 14:39.169
THESE STUPID SONS
OF BITCHES.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.629
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:40.629 --> 14:42.756
I'M LOOKING FOR JOHN IRVIN.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.091
I'M JOHN IRVIN.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.509
AH. ALLEN WALKER.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.971
I REPRESENT YOUR SISTER DELIA
REGARDING YOUR FATHER'S ESTATE.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.222
YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

14:50.222 --> 14:51.432
THIS WAY.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.398
I APOLOGIZE FOR JUST DROPPING
IN, BUT I WAS IN THE AREA,

14:59.398 --> 15:00.941
AND THIS IS INFORMAL.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.527
SHE MENTIONED SOMEONE
MIGHT COME BY.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.528
COFFEE?

15:04.528 --> 15:07.156
UH, YEAH.
BLACK'S FINE. THANKS.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.326
DID SHE TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S WILL?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.869
SHE SAID IT WAS COMPLICATED

15:11.869 --> 15:14.580
AND YOU COULD EXPLAIN IT BETTER
THAN SHE COULD.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.499
WELL, I'LL TRY, BUT SHE'S RIGHT.
IT IS COMPLICATED.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.293
HE WASN'T ONE
TO PLAN AHEAD.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.711
ON THE SIMPLE SIDE,

15:20.711 --> 15:22.796
AFTER CREDITORS --
AND THERE ARE MANY --

15:22.796 --> 15:25.716
THE REMAINDER OF THE ESTATE WILL
BE DIVIDED EVENLY

15:25.716 --> 15:27.676
BETWEEN YOURSELF AND DELIA --
50/50.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.136
WHAT KIND OF CREDITORS?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.597
YOUR FATHER HAD A 30-YEAR
MORTGAGE ON THE HOUSE

15:31.597 --> 15:33.515
OF WHICH 10 YEARS WAS LEFT
UNPAID,

15:33.515 --> 15:35.851
AND THE PROPERTY TAXES COME DUE
NEXT MONTH.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.604
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PLAN ON
DOING WITH THE PROPERTY,

15:38.604 --> 15:41.482
BUT DELIA MENTIONED SELLING IT
TO OFFSET INHERITANCE TAXES,

15:41.482 --> 15:42.816
WHICH MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.276
ALL RIGHT.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.904
THERE ARE ALSO CAR PAYMENTS,
OUTSTANDING UTILITIES,

15:46.904 --> 15:48.364
IRA MAINTENANCE FEES,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.325
AND OF COURSE, THE EXPENSES OF
LAST ILLNESS.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.036
SOME OF THESE ARE PIDDLING,
OTHERS HEFTY.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.663
TO BE HONEST, IT'S MESSY.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
I SEE.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.958
FIRST STEP IS TO SCHEDULE
A CONFERENCE CALL

15:58.958 --> 16:01.251
BETWEEN YOU, ME, AND DELIA TO
PORE OVER THE DETAILS,

16:01.251 --> 16:02.836
MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE
SAME PAGE.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.505
THAT'S FINE, MR. WALKER.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.467
WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE, HOW
MUCH TO YOU THINK WE'LL OWE?

16:08.467 --> 16:11.720
UM...I MUST NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
MYSELF CLEARLY.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.973
YOU'RE NOT GONNA OWE
ANYTHING.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.016
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
"NUMEROUS CREDITORS."

16:16.016 --> 16:17.518
ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.062
ON THE PLUS SIDE, HE DID
HAVE A COMPLETE PORTFOLIO,

16:20.062 --> 16:22.523
AND THE HOME AND PROPERTY ARE
SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.732
IT'S A HEALTHY ESTATE.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.109
HOW MUCH SO?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.111
I DON'T LIKE TO GIVE OUT
ESTIMATES

16:27.111 --> 16:29.071
IN CASE UNFORESEEN DEBTS
CROP UP,

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
BUT CONSERVATIVELY,
AFTER TAXES,

16:31.031 --> 16:33.534
YOU SHOULD COME AWAY WITH
ABOUT $800,000, EACH.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.079
HERE'S A COPY OF THE WILL
FOR YOU.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.581
AND I'LL BE IN TOUCH REGARDING
THE CONFERENCE CALL.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.667
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.585
[ Breathless ] YOU TOO.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.261
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU, MR. LOWE.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.345
WHERE YOU BEEN?

16:53.345 --> 16:54.388
ON THE GOLF COURSE.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
WE CHECKED YOUR
COUNTRY CLUB.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.392
I WAS INVITED TO PLAY WINGFOOT
IN WESTCHESTER.

16:58.392 --> 17:00.185
ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO HARD TO FIND?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.730
I WANTED SOME PEACE,
SO I TURNED OFF MY PHONE.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.065
I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW SCOTT
JUST DISAPPEARED

17:05.065 --> 17:07.276
UNDER MY EX-WIFE'S NOSE.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.278
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW
YOUR SON?
LAST SUNDAY.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.321
CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR YOUR
WHEREABOUTS

17:11.321 --> 17:13.157
FROM LAST NIGHT
TO THIS MORNING?

17:13.157 --> 17:14.283
WHAT? WHY?

17:14.283 --> 17:16.869
BECAUSE WE NEED TO
RULE YOU OUT AS A SUSPECT.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.037
I DIDN'T TAKE SCOTT.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.372
THEN LET US RULE YOU OUT
AND FIND OUT WHO DID.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.623
WHERE WERE YOU?

17:21.623 --> 17:24.084
I WAS OUT TO DINNER WITH A
FRIEND AND HIS WIFE

17:24.084 --> 17:25.210
FROM 8:00 TO 10:30,

17:25.210 --> 17:27.296
AND THEN I WAS HOME
TILL THIS MORNING.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.630
I GOT PICKED UP AT 6:00.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.050
CAN ANYONE VOUCH FOR YOU FROM
10:30 TO 6:00?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.301
I WAS SLEEPING!

17:32.301 --> 17:34.470
WHICH I DOUBT IS WHAT
CATHERINE WAS DOING

17:34.470 --> 17:36.472
AND PROBABLY WHY
WE'RE IN THIS MESS.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.432
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE?

17:38.432 --> 17:41.143
SHE'S UNTRUSTWORTHY.
HER FOCUS IN LIFE IS PARTYING.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.811
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE DIVORCED?

17:42.811 --> 17:43.896
YES.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.230
HOW'D SHE GET CUSTODY?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.691
SHE ACCUSED ME OF BEING THE ONE
WHO WAS CHEATING

17:47.691 --> 17:48.942
AND GOING OUT AND, UH...

17:48.942 --> 17:51.236
I BLEW UP IN COURT AND
CALLED HER A BITCH.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.489
WE HAD A FEMALE JUDGE,
AND THAT WAS THAT.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.783
IF HIS MOM'S IRRESPONSIBLE
AND OUT PARTYING,

17:55.783 --> 17:58.494
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT HE'D NEED
PROTECTING FROM THAT.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.329
I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T TAKE SCOTT.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
WE KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD US.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.458
WE'RE GIVING YOU ANOTHER CHANCE
TO STAY OUT OF JAIL.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.336
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? MY SON IS MISSING.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.047
IF YOU GOT HIM, WE'LL FIND OUT,
AND IT'S SERIOUS.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.965
BUT IF THIS WAS A
MISUNDERSTANDING

18:11.965 --> 18:14.259
AND WE HEAR THAT NOW,
IT CAN ALL GO AWAY.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.470
WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS
IN FAMILY COURT.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.347
I WAS GETTING BETTER
VISITATION.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.765
WHY WOULD I SCREW THAT UP?

18:19.765 --> 18:23.060
IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
YOU THINK WE SHOULD TALK TO?

18:23.060 --> 18:25.312
CATHERINE OR HER DRINKING
BUDDIES

18:25.312 --> 18:28.732
OR BARTENDERS OR HER SCUMBAG
BIKER MECHANIC BOYFRIEND.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.942
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.860
ALL I KNOW IS STEVE.
HE'S A DRUNK.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.612
THEY FIGHT ALL THE TIME,

18:33.612 --> 18:35.823

YOU FEEL YOUR EX-HUSBAND WAS
CAPABLE OF KILLING SCOTT?

HE COULD HAVE TAKEN SCOTT,
KIDNAPPED HIM.

I WAS IN COLLEGE.

UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO ASK,

55:27.699 --> 55:29.034

I AM NOT GAY! I'M NOT
ATTRACTED TO BOYS!

YEAH.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.969
WHEN SHE LEAVE?

56:29.969 --> 56:32.764

56:41.022 --> 56:42.399
NOT THAT I SAW.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.943
ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT
CATHERINE FOR DOING THIS?

56:44.943 --> 56:47.404
DAVE, WE GOT PLACES TO BE.
HOW ABOUT ANSWERING?

56:47.404 --> 56:50.365

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:02.189
NOW WE'RE DONE.

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:15.453
HAVE YOU HAD
ANY PROGRESS?

1:05:15.453 --> 1:05:16.537
A LITTLE.

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:20.082
PLEASE JUST TELL ME

1:05:20.082 --> 1:05:22.668
THAT HE WASN'T MOLESTED
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

1:05:22.668 --> 1:05:25.046
JUST TELL ME
THAT SCOTT DIDN'T SUFFER.

1:05:25.046 --> 1:05:26.881
THERE'S NOTHING
TO INDICATE THAT.

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:28.049
THANK GOD.

1:05:28.049 --> 1:05:29.800
MS. LOWE, WE GOT
A FINGERPRINT HIT

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.802
OFF A FOOTBALL HELMET IN YOUR
SON'S ROOM.

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:32.970
FROM WHO?

1:05:32.970 --> 1:05:34.597
A RICK SAVRAN.

1:05:34.597 --> 1:05:36.223
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

1:05:36.223 --> 1:05:38.351
DO YOU KNOW HIM,
MS. LOWE?

1:05:38.351 --> 1:05:40.227
YEAH, I KNOW RICK.

1:05:40.227 --> 1:05:41.520
HOW?

1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:44.231
UM, HE'S A FRIEND
OF MY BOYFRIEND STEVE'S.

1:05:44.231 --> 1:05:45.524
WHEN WAS HE OVER HERE?

1:05:45.524 --> 1:05:46.734
ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:48.903
DON'T TELL STEVE
THAT RICK WAS OVER HERE.

1:05:48.903 --> 1:05:50.029
IT WOULD LOOK WRONG.

1:05:50.029 --> 1:05:51.739
'CAUSE RICK SAVRAN
SPENT THE NIGHT?

1:05:51.739 --> 1:05:53.157
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

1:05:53.157 --> 1:05:56.410
MS. LOWE, YOU NEED TO TELL US
WHO'S BEEN IN THIS APARTMENT!

1:05:56.410 --> 1:05:57.870
RICK SPENT THE NIGHT<i> ONCE.</i>

1:05:57.870 --> 1:05:59.997
SCOTT WAS SLEEPING
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

1:05:59.997 --> 1:06:01.499
RICK WOULD NOT KILL SCOTT!

1:06:01.499 --> 1:06:04.210
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE GOTTA BRING HIM INTO THIS!

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:06.045
HAVE ANY OTHER MEN
SPENT THE NIGHT

1:06:06.045 --> 1:06:08.172
OR BEEN OVER HERE
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS?

1:06:08.172 --> 1:06:10.800
PHIL WESTON.
I WORK WITH HIM.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:12.677
WE'LL NEED TO SPEAK WITH BOTH
OF THEM.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:14.470
YOU WANNA HEAR
THE DIRTY DETAILS?!

1:06:14.470 --> 1:06:16.764
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO CAUSE YOU EMBARRASSMENT,

1:06:16.764 --> 1:06:18.766
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT MEN
HAVE BEEN

1:06:18.766 --> 1:06:21.227
IN THIS APARTMENT, 'CAUSE
WHEN KIDS GET MURDERED,

1:06:21.227 --> 1:06:23.270
IT'S USUALLY BY MEN
WHO KNEW THE VICTIM!

1:06:23.270 --> 1:06:25.189
PHIL AND RICK --
THAT'S IT!

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:26.565
THAT'S ALL THERE WAS!

1:06:26.565 --> 1:06:28.734
ARE YOU PROTECTING ANYONE,
MS. LOWE?

1:06:28.734 --> 1:06:31.028
GET OUT OF MY APARTMENT!
NOW! GET OUT!

1:06:40.037 --> 1:06:41.288
DETECTIVE ORTIZ.

1:06:43.499 --> 1:06:45.710
WE NEED A SEARCH WARRANT
ON DWYER'S APARTMENT.

1:06:45.710 --> 1:06:47.503
BASED ON WHAT?

1:06:47.503 --> 1:06:50.297
TWO PHONE CALLS TO THE D.O.A.'s
THE NIGHT HE WENT MISSING.

1:06:50.297 --> 1:06:53.467
BOTH THE DAD AND SON SAID
THEY DIDN'T MAKE ANY CALLS.

1:06:53.467 --> 1:06:54.719
WERE THERE MESSAGES?

1:06:54.719 --> 1:06:55.886
NO.

1:06:55.886 --> 1:06:57.722
WHAT WAS THE DAD
AND SON'S EXCUSE?

1:06:57.722 --> 1:07:00.474
THE DAD GOT BELLIGERENT,
SAID HIS SON MIGHT HAVE FORGOT.

1:07:00.474 --> 1:07:02.810
THERE'S NO WAY YOU FORGET
ABOUT TWO CALLS.

1:07:02.810 --> 1:07:04.395
WE NEED A SEARCH WARRANT

1:07:04.395 --> 1:07:07.523
SO WE CAN HAVE CRIME SCENE
PROCESS THE APARTMENT.

1:07:07.523 --> 1:07:09.900
CAN YOU CALL COURT
AND EXPEDITE IT?

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:12.945
YEAH. SWING BY THERE
AND SWEAR TO THE AFFIDAVIT.

1:07:12.945 --> 1:07:14.071
THANKS.

1:07:18.325 --> 1:07:21.495
THAT WAS THE SUPER AT
THE ELDERLY D.O.A.'s BUILDING.

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:23.372
HE SAID THE GRANDSON, JERRY
GAVIOLA,

1:07:23.372 --> 1:07:24.582
SHOWED UP 10 MINUTES AGO

1:07:24.582 --> 1:07:26.709
AND WENT INTO
HIS GRANDMOTHER'S APARTMENT.

1:07:26.709 --> 1:07:28.294
ISN'T THE APARTMENT SEALED?

1:07:28.294 --> 1:07:30.421
HE RIPPED
THE CRIME-SCENE TAPE OFF.

1:07:30.421 --> 1:07:33.049
WE BETTER HEAD OVER THERE
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:34.133
YEAH.

1:07:36.469 --> 1:07:38.304
DID THE MOM KNOW
RICK SAVRAN?

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:40.097
YEAH, BANGED HIM A WEEK
AGO.

1:07:40.097 --> 1:07:42.308
SHE BANGING ANYBODY ELSE?

UH, DETECTIVE JONES?

1:07:59.492 --> 1:08:02.536
YEAH? MAYA.

1:08:02.536 --> 1:08:04.330
VERY GOOD. YOU REMEMBERED.

1:08:04.330 --> 1:08:05.831
UH, REAL QUICK.

1:08:05.831 --> 1:08:07.458

YOU WORKED UNTIL 1815.

1:08:11.212 --> 1:08:14.507
OUR RECORDS AT THE BOROUGH
HAVE YOUR TOUR ENDING AT 1800.

1:08:14.507 --> 1:08:17.259
THAT'S 15 MINUTES
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

1:08:17.259 --> 1:08:20.179
NOW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS?

1:08:20.179 --> 1:08:22.681
[ CHUCKLES ]
UH, MAYA...

1:08:22.681 --> 1:08:23.974
YES, DETECTIVE?

1:08:23.974 --> 1:08:27.269
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A
REALLY IMPORTANT CASE.

1:08:27.269 --> 1:08:29.980
OH. OKAY.

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.358
I'M SORRY.

1:08:32.358 --> 1:08:35.069
MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.

1:08:35.069 --> 1:08:39.031
YEAH, I'D, UM,
I'D LET THIS SLIDE IF I COULD,

1:08:39.031 --> 1:08:40.241
BUT I CAN'T.

1:08:40.241 --> 1:08:42.660
SEE, THAT'S 15 MINUTES
OF TAXPAYER MONEY

1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:43.869
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1:08:43.869 --> 1:08:45.287
[ CHUCKLES ]

1:08:45.287 --> 1:08:47.331
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY OVER TO
PICK IT UP.

1:08:47.331 --> 1:08:49.333
I'LL HOLD.

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:50.626
Whew!

1:08:50.626 --> 1:08:51.669
WHAT?

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:53.504
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT.

1:08:53.504 --> 1:08:55.089
I THINK YOU GOT
A GOOD IDEA.

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:56.298
I'M SERIOUS.

1:08:56.298 --> 1:08:58.843
NOT AROUND ME, BALDWIN.
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

YEAH, I'M RIGHT HERE.
UH-HUH.

1:09:13.899 --> 1:09:15.234

1:09:15.234 --> 1:09:17.903
WE GOT A SEARCH WARRANT, TOMMY.
WE NEED TO COME INSIDE.

1:09:17.903 --> 1:09:19.071
FOR WHAT?

1:09:19.071 --> 1:09:20.823
WE'RE GONNA PROCESS

INTO SOMETHING.

TURNING THIS INTO SOMETHING.

LET'S GO, GUYS.

THE DOOR.

1:09:48.601 --> 1:09:51.270

1:09:51.270 --> 1:09:53.272
OPEN THE DOOR.

UGH.

1:10:26.263 --> 1:10:27.431

1:10:27.431 --> 1:10:29.934

ON A BUS ANYWAY.

1:10:47.868 --> 1:10:49.620
I WOULD HAVE OPENED
THE DOOR SOONER

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.121
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
HE WAS GONNA DO THIS.

1:10:51.121 --> 1:10:52.915
IT'S OKAY.

1:10:52.915 --> 1:10:55.751
COME ON, COME ON. IT'S ALL
RIGHT.

1:10:55.751 --> 1:10:58.671
M.E. SAID SHE WAS RAPED, THEN
STRANGLED.

1:10:58.671 --> 1:11:01.006

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:20.276

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:23.654

SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK.

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:39.461
WELL, THIS IS
OUR CRIME SCENE.

1:11:54.101 --> 1:11:56.103
JUST TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED, TOMMY.

1:11:56.103 --> 1:11:59.773
I WILL, BUT YOU GOTTA PROMISE
THAT THIS WILL LAND ON<i> ME.</i>

1:11:59.773 --> 1:12:01.442
LEAVE MY SON OUT OF IT.

1:12:01.442 --> 1:12:04.069
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TILL WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

1:12:04.069 --> 1:12:06.238
SCOTT WAS OVER.

1:12:06.238 --> 1:12:09.533
I WENT OUT TO GET SOME PIZZAS,
RENT SOME VIDEO GAMES.

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:12.036
I WAS GONE A HALF-HOUR, AT
THE MOST.

1:12:12.036 --> 1:12:14.872
I NEVER HID MY GUNS
FROM JAKE.

1:12:14.872 --> 1:12:16.790
LIKE THEY TELL YOU IN THE
ACADEMY,

1:12:16.790 --> 1:12:19.209
"DON'T MAKE YOUR GUNS
A MYSTERY TO YOUR KIDS."

1:12:19.209 --> 1:12:22.129
IF HE WANTED, I'D UNLOAD IT
AND LET HIM HOLD IT.

1:12:28.218 --> 1:12:31.430
JAKE SAID THAT SCOTT HAD BEEN
AFTER HIM TO SEE THE GUN.

1:12:31.430 --> 1:12:33.349
SO JAKE WENT IN THE CLOSET
AND GOT IT.

1:12:33.349 --> 1:12:35.851
AND SCOTT WANTED
TO PUT THE CLIP IN,

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:37.102
SO JAKE DID.

1:12:37.102 --> 1:12:39.355
AND THEY TOOK TURNS
SNAPPING THE CLIP IN

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:40.439
AND HEAR THE CLICK.

1:12:40.439 --> 1:12:41.899
BUT JAKE TOOK THE CLIP OUT.

1:12:41.899 --> 1:12:44.276
AND THEN THEY STARTED
PLAYING WITH IT AGAIN.

1:12:47.196 --> 1:12:49.865
[ Crying] HE DIDN'T KNOW...

1:12:49.865 --> 1:12:55.454
I KEEP ONE IN THE CHAMBER.

1:12:55.454 --> 1:12:57.831
I GOT THERE
10 MINUTES AFTER IT HAPPENED,

1:12:57.831 --> 1:12:58.999
AND SCOTT WAS DEAD.

1:12:58.999 --> 1:13:01.835
WHEN DID YOU BURY SCOTT?

1:13:01.835 --> 1:13:02.836
THAT NIGHT.

1:13:02.836 --> 1:13:05.297
THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO.

1:13:05.297 --> 1:13:07.716
AND THERE WAS NO WAY
I WAS TAKING A CHANCE

1:13:07.716 --> 1:13:10.052
AT MY SON DOING TIME
IN A YOUTH FACILITY.

1:13:10.052 --> 1:13:11.220
HE WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:13.764
DID YOU GIVE HALF A THOUGHT
TO THE INVESTIGATION?

1:13:13.764 --> 1:13:15.849
OF COURSE I DID, AND I
WANT IT KNOWN

1:13:15.849 --> 1:13:18.143
I PUT SCOTT IN A PLACE
WHERE HE'D BE FOUND

1:13:18.143 --> 1:13:20.104
SO HE COULD HAVE
A PROPER FUNERAL.

1:13:20.104 --> 1:13:21.522
I COULD HAVE MADE IT

1:13:21.522 --> 1:13:23.899
SO THAT HIS BODY NEVER
WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

1:13:23.899 --> 1:13:26.568
MEANWHILE, WE'RE RIPPING
HIS FAMILY'S GUTS OUT,

1:13:26.568 --> 1:13:28.862
FIGURING ONE OF THEM
TO BE THE KILLER!

1:13:28.862 --> 1:13:30.364
I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR MY SON!

1:13:30.364 --> 1:13:32.366
BY TEACHING HIM
HOW TO COVER THINGS UP?

1:13:32.366 --> 1:13:35.202
TURNING HIM INTO
A CO-CONSPIRATOR
IN A CRIMINAL ACT?

1:13:38.330 --> 1:13:40.374
WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO JAKE NOW.

1:13:40.374 --> 1:13:43.669
PUT THIS ON ME --
FAILURE TO SAFEGUARD A GUN,

1:13:43.669 --> 1:13:46.630
TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE,
DISPOSAL OF A BODY.

1:13:46.630 --> 1:13:49.425
PUT IT ALL ON ME,
BUT DON'T CHARGE MY SON.

1:13:49.425 --> 1:13:52.469
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, MR. DWYER.

1:13:52.469 --> 1:13:53.971
IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS TRUE,

1:13:53.971 --> 1:13:56.682
JAKE WILL BE ARRESTED
FOR SECOND-DEGREE MANSLAUGHTER,

1:13:56.682 --> 1:13:58.767
AND IT'LL BE HANDLED
IN FAMILY COURT.

1:13:58.767 --> 1:14:01.103
I CAN'T GET ANY
CONSIDERATION?

1:14:01.103 --> 1:14:03.063
20 YEARS I PUT ON THIS JOB!

1:14:03.063 --> 1:14:05.441
IF THE FACTS YOU RELAYED HOLD
TRUE,

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:08.694
MY OFFICE WILL RECOMMEND
TO THE CORPORATION COUNSEL

1:14:08.694 --> 1:14:12.197
THAT NO PERIOD OF INCARCERATION
WILL BE IMPOSED ON JAKE.

1:14:12.197 --> 1:14:14.575
BUT HE WILL BE ARRESTED
AND CHARGED.

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:22.124
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1:14:24.835 --> 1:14:26.378
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1:14:26.378 --> 1:14:28.797
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
LEFT IT AT THAT.

1:14:38.307 --> 1:14:41.018
