00:14.472 --> 00:18.101
-What is this?
-Provisions. From my ship.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.229
And your crew fell in line behind me.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.064
You have failed.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.718
CANCRI IV
NEUTRAL TERRITORY

41:10.176 --> 41:11.594
Are you there, General Kol?

41:12.928 --> 41:15.389
I am indeed, Dennas.

41:15.848 --> 41:19.477
And I am pleased to see

41:20.060 --> 41:23.689
how you have taken care
of our Cancri hosts.

41:23.981 --> 41:29.361
I was hoping to get
a high-ranking Vulcan,

41:29.445 --> 41:33.824
but she is so much better.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.661
You have proven yourselves worthy.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.208
You shall be welcome
in my new United Klingon Empire

41:42.291 --> 41:47.463
and will receive the ability
to cloak your ships as a result.
