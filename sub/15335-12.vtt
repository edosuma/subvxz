VARIOUS SUPPORTERS

25:42.942 --> 25:44.076
OF GENERAL RAJA'S
CAUSE.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.212
ALSO, EMPLOYEES
OF THE RESTAURANT.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.880
I AM CONFIDENT
ONE OF THEM

25:47.914 --> 25:52.652
WILL BE ABLE TO TELL
US WHO HAS TAKEN
YOUR SENATOR.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.688
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

25:55.722 --> 25:58.891
I WILL BEGIN AGGRESSIVE
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES

25:58.925 --> 26:03.195
UNTIL ONE OF THEM
REVEALS THE AUTHORS
OF THIS CRIME.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.097
TORTURE?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.933
YOU DO NOT NEED
TO BE PRESENT

26:06.966 --> 26:09.435
IF IT MAKES YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.

26:10.502 --> 26:14.206
HOW HIGH IS THE REWARD
YOU'VE OFFERED YOUR PEOPLE
FOR THE SENATOR?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.742
ONE MILLIONS RUPLES.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.076
WHAT IS THAT?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.978
$3,000, $4,000
AMERICAN?

26:19.011 --> 26:20.112
IT IS A FORTUNE
TO DREAM OF

26:20.146 --> 26:21.614
TO ALMOST EVERYONE
ON THIS ISLAND.

26:21.648 --> 26:25.017
WELL, I WOULD
STRONGLY URGE YOU
TO DREAM BIGGER.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.670
MOLLY, THERE'S NO WAY.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.471
Molly: THEY'RE ONLY
GETTING ENGAGED ONCE.

26:45.504 --> 26:46.505
I SENT JEREMY OVER THERE.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.908
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS GIVE HIM A SPECIAL NIGHT.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.810
OH, WELL HOW SPECIAL
IS IT GOING TO BE

26:50.843 --> 26:52.278
IF SHE FINDS ME
AND THE OTHER WIVES

26:52.311 --> 26:55.081
TAPING CARPET
TO HER PATIO?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.749
JUST KEEP WORKING.

26:56.783 --> 26:57.984
I'LL BE HAPPY
IF I NEVER SEE

26:58.017 --> 26:59.118
PINK OR GREEN CARPET
AGAIN.

26:59.151 --> 27:03.155
YOU AND THE REST
OF THE WORLD
KEEP WORKING.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.966
AUNT MOLLY, WANT TO SEE
MY NEW DOLL HOUSE?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.167
NOT NOW, BABY.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.302
IT HAS A CHANDELIER.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.104
IT DOES?
WANT TO SEE?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.106
LATER, BABY.
GO PLAY.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.573
OK.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.976
Crystal: WHAT IS
GOING ON IN HERE?

27:24.010 --> 27:26.545
UH, THANK YOU GIFTS
FOR THE F.R.G. FUNDRAISER.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.982

IN MY LIVING ROOM.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.550
MMM. GENEROUS YOU.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.152
DON'T YOU HAVE
TO GET TO WORK?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.721
ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING
OF CALLING IN SICK.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.222
YOU'RE SICK?

27:36.255 --> 27:38.024
NO. BUT IT'S BEEN
A LONG WEEK.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.059
I THOUGHT I'D SPEND
A QUIET NIGHT AT HOME.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.494
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

27:42.528 --> 27:43.195
WHAT? WHY?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.530
BECAUSE...
BECAUSE...

27:44.563 --> 27:46.866
BECAUSE IT'S A MATTER
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.634
WELL, IT'S JUST
ONE NIGHT.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.971
RESPONSIBILITY
TO YOUR LOVED ONES
IN THE FIELD.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.139
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.474
SAVE YOUR DAYS OFF
FOR WHEN YOU CAN
USE THEM WITH JEREMY.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.544
WHO KNOWS
WHEN HE'LL BE BACK.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.751
YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.340
I'M HERE
TO SEE GENERAL RAJA.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.942
HE WILL SEE
THE SENATOR ONLY.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.011
I DON'T SPEAK
FOR THE SENATOR.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.413

28:39.318 --> 28:42.488
I'M HERE FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.632
GENERAL.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.449
THE PRESIDENT
SENDS HIS GREETINGS.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.717
BEFORE WE BEGIN,

29:11.750 --> 29:15.054
I FEEL I MUST
TELL YOU

29:15.087 --> 29:16.222
LOCAL RADIO IS REPORTING

29:16.255 --> 29:17.957
YOUR SENATOR HAS BEEN
KIDNAPPED.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.391
WHAT?

29:19.425 --> 29:20.392
I AM SORRY.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.760
FROM WHERE?
AND BY WHOM?

29:21.794 --> 29:22.761
I DO NOT KNOW.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.164
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU
NEITHER I NOR
MY ASSOCIATES

29:25.197 --> 29:26.132
HAVE DONE THIS.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.400
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO LEAVE NOW
TO SEARCH FOR HER,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.469
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.205
HOLY HELL!

29:36.442 --> 29:38.077
YOU'VE GOT ONE HOUR
TO CONVINCE ME

29:38.110 --> 29:41.647
THAT THE UNITED STATES
SHOULD PUT YOU IN POWER.

29:53.725 --> 29:55.594
I TELL YOU EVERYTHING--
ALL MY PLANS.

29:55.627 --> 29:56.829
I'VE JUST TOLD YOU
HOW TO STOP ME.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.531
HOW'S IT GOING TO GO DOWN
FOR YOU WITH U.S. SUPPORT?

29:59.565 --> 30:02.034
WE'LL FOLLOW
THE STRATEGIC MODEL

30:02.068 --> 30:03.635
SET UP BY THE VIET CONG.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.337
THE PRESIDENT TRAVELS
ON THE 18th.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.705
BY SUNDOWN ON THE 19th,

30:06.738 --> 30:08.107
WE WILL CONTROL
THE COUNTRY.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.842

NONE.

30:09.876 --> 30:10.943
MM-HMM. AND THIS?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.444
AT THE HOUR OF THE COUP,
WE WILL TAKE OVER

30:12.478 --> 30:14.680
ALL RADIO
AND TELEVISION STATIONS.

30:14.713 --> 30:15.882
AH, THE OPPOSITION
CAN'T REACT

30:15.915 --> 30:17.316
IF IT DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.717
WE DON'T SIMPLY SHUT OFF
THE BROADCASTS,

30:18.750 --> 30:20.853
WE TAKE CONTROL
OF THE AIRWAVES--
ANNOUNCE SUCCESS.

30:20.887 --> 30:24.123
ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE
ALREADY SEIZED POWER.
WHY?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.691
WORLD WANTS TO BE
ON THE WINNING TEAM.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.060
WE SEIZE CONTROL
OVER VILLAGES,

30:28.094 --> 30:29.495
AND THE VILLAGERS
WILL FOLLOW.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.964
A COUNTRY OF 14 MILLION.

30:31.998 --> 30:35.234
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
AT BEST 15% IN ARMS.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.237
I NEED ONLY HAVE
ACTIVE SUPPORT OF 15%

30:38.270 --> 30:42.341
AND THE ABILITY
TO ESTABLISH POSITIVE
CONTROL OVER 25.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.342
GENERAL MAO.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.911
YOU'RE
A MILITARY HISTORIAN.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.846
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AN ART HISTORY MAJOR.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.750
I STUDIED MILITARY
STRATEGY DATING BACK
TO ROME.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.020
YOU DON'T WIN WARS
READING BOOKS.

30:54.053 --> 30:54.853
YES.

30:54.887 --> 30:58.224
THIS IS WHAT I'VE
LEARNED, PRECISELY.

30:59.458 --> 31:03.595
WE'VE GOT 10,000
OF THESE STOCKPILED.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.530
BUT WE NEED MORE.

31:04.563 --> 31:07.066
AND WE NEED ECONOMIC
AND MILITARY SUPPORT.

31:07.099 --> 31:10.036
WHAT IS
YOUR PRESIDENT'S OFFER?

31:10.069 --> 31:14.073
YOUR COUNTRY
IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE
TO SECURE THESE THINGS.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.507
CHINA?

31:15.541 --> 31:17.209
AMONG MANY OTHER PLACES.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.511
BUT, OF COURSE,

31:19.545 --> 31:24.050
AMERICA
IS MY FIRST CHOICE.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.587
OUR CAMP IS FAR
FROM CIVILIZATION,

31:28.620 --> 31:32.391
BUT I THINK
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED
AT THE AMENITIES.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.026
SUCH AS?

31:34.060 --> 31:37.263
MY CHEF TRAINED
AT THE CORDON BLEU.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.158
TO THE ACTIVE SUPPORT...

32:06.192 --> 32:08.494
OF 15%.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.313
I'M CURIOUS, GENERAL.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.482
WHY YOU PREFER AMERICA
TO THE CHINESE IN THIS MATTER.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.119
CERTAINLY, THEY'RE
THE CLOSER NEIGHBORS.

32:33.152 --> 32:37.123
AHH. MY ESTEEMED
CHEF QUOT.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.497
AT COLLEGE
IN YOUR COUNTRY,

32:45.531 --> 32:48.967
I SPENT 4 YEARS
FALLING IN LOVE
WITH AMERICA.

32:49.001 --> 32:52.204
THE GENERAL GRADUATED
SUMMA CUM LAUDE.

32:52.238 --> 32:54.006
YOUR FATHER
MUST HAVE BEEN PROUD.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.308
MY FATHER WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO PLEASE.

32:56.342 --> 33:00.046
ONCE, WHEN THE CAMPUS
WAS CELEBRATING
A FOOTBALL VICTORY,

33:00.079 --> 33:02.781
MY FRIENDS AND I,
WE CLIMBED TO THE TOP
OF A STREETLIGHT.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.452
SOMEONE SNAPPED A PHOTO.
AND THE NEXT DAY IT
APPEARED IN A NEWSPAPER.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.187
MY FATHER WAS FURIOUS.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.221
HE WAS TOO HARD ON YOU.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.722
I THOUGHT SO.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.025
UNTIL HE WAS MURDERED
THE NEXT WEEK.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.461
AND MY FAMILY
WAS CHASED INTO EXILE.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.063
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.299
21 YEARS OLD, A STUDENT
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY--

33:20.332 --> 33:21.967
IT WAS A DARK PERIOD.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.072
BUT I WAS BORNE
THROUGH IT BY DESTINY.

33:26.105 --> 33:26.938
DESTINY?

33:26.972 --> 33:29.241
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THE NAME
RAJA MEANS?

33:29.275 --> 33:30.309
KING, I BELIEVE.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.345
YOU'RE WELL INFORMED.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.314
THESE ARE CHAOTIC TIMES.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.750
AND THE MANDALUAN PEOPLE
NEED A LEADER.

33:38.784 --> 33:39.918
IT IS MY BIRTHRIGHT,

33:39.951 --> 33:42.521
AND I INTEND TO FULFILL
IT WITH OR WITHOUT
AMERICAN AID.

33:42.554 --> 33:43.589
ON YOUR LIST THE REQUESTS,

33:43.622 --> 33:47.659
I DON'T SEE ELECTION OFFICIALS
OR BALLOT BOXES.

33:47.693 --> 33:48.860
THE MOST SUITABLE AID

33:48.894 --> 33:50.996
WOULD BE
M4 SUBMACHINE GUNS

33:51.029 --> 33:53.365
AND C-130
TRANSPORT PLANES.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.000
WHICH YOU
CAN PROVIDE THROUGH

33:55.033 --> 33:58.036
THE ANTI-TERRORISM
ACTIVITIES FUND.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.771
SECURITY FIRST.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.540
THEN ELECTIONS.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.111
AHH. EXCELLENT.

34:05.144 --> 34:08.447
FOIE GRAS WITH TRUFFLES.

34:15.287 --> 34:17.723
HOW LONG HAS YOUR CHEF
BEEN WITH YOU?

34:17.756 --> 34:19.591
OVER A DECADE.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.559
AND HE TASTES EVERY DISH--

34:20.592 --> 34:24.029
I WON'T BE BETRAYED
LIKE MY FATHER WAS.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.264
I SEE.

34:25.297 --> 34:28.967
THE EMPEROR CLAUDIUS
DIED FROM A PLATE
OF TAINTED MUSHROOMS.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.137
HMM.
SO, TELL ME, MR. GREEN.

34:31.170 --> 34:34.940
WHAT WILL YOU REPORT
BACK TO YOUR PRESIDENT?

34:34.973 --> 34:38.144
THAT YOU'RE
AN IMPECCABLE HOST.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.584
HEY. I WENT
TO 4 DIFFERENT PLACES

34:45.617 --> 34:46.918
BEFORE I FOUND
THESE LAMPS.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.120
I USED TO HAVE
ONE OF THESE

34:48.154 --> 34:50.055
IN MY ROOM
AS A TEENAGER.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.056
FEELIN' DATED?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.458
A LITTLE BIT.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.225
YOU HAVE THE OUTFITS.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.926
GOT 'EM.
WE SHOULD GET MOVIN'.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.464
I GOT TO GET
BACK TO BLACKTHORN
TO MEET JEREMY.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.866
SEE YOU AT THE RAINBOW ROOM.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.301
YOU ALL SET?

35:02.334 --> 35:04.570
I CAN'T FIND THE RING.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.305
HEH HEH.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.775
YOU'RE SURE
I WAS THE LAST ONE
TO HAVE IT?

35:09.808 --> 35:12.344
I'M POSITIVE.
I WATCHED YOU
PUT IT ON THE COUNTER.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.780
WELL, IT'S NOT
ON THE COUNTER.

35:14.813 --> 35:15.981
WHY WOULD IT BE IN THERE?

35:16.014 --> 35:17.115
I DON'T KNOW, KIM!

35:17.149 --> 35:21.119
LOOK, I PAID FOR
THIS RING WITH MONEY
THAT I DON'T HAVE.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.488
SO, I INTEND TO FIND IT.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.355
JEREMY WILL PAY YOU BACK.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.356
NOT IF HE
DOESN'T GET IT.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.757
WELL, I'LL PAY YOU BACK THEN.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.593
WITH WHAT?
I SEE.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.494
I ASKED YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

35:28.527 --> 35:31.397
I LOST THE RING.
SO, IT'S MY FAULT.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.099
LOOK, FOR THE SAKE
OF TIME,

35:34.132 --> 35:37.303
LET'S SKIP PAST
THE "I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE SORRY."

35:37.336 --> 35:38.537
AND JUST FIND THE RING.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.871
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

35:39.905 --> 35:41.873
WHERE ELSE
WERE YOU WORKING TODAY?

35:41.907 --> 35:44.776
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.178
OH, NO.
WHAT?

35:46.212 --> 35:50.649
THE F.R.G. FLOWER BASKETS.
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.753
EVERY MISSION
HAS ITS SACRIFICES.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.023
COME ON.

36:01.727 --> 36:02.661
CLOCK'S RUNNIN'.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.864
THE PREMIER AGREES
WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATION

36:05.897 --> 36:08.667
AND HAS INCREASED THE REWARD
TO 100 MILLION RUPLES.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.037
WELL, I SEE WISDOM
ISN'T COMPLETELY ABSENT
IN THESE PARTS.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.171
HOWEVER, HE SUGGESTS THAT

36:13.205 --> 36:15.140
WE PROCEED WITH
THE INTERROGATIONS.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.009
LOOK, ONE LIE
UNDER TORTURE COSTS
US ABOUT 6 HOURS.

36:18.043 --> 36:19.177
AND I DON'T CARE
TO BE MADE A PART

36:19.211 --> 36:20.979
OF HOW YOU ABUSE
YOUR CITIZENS.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.849
PERHAPS WE COULD
GIVE THE REWARD
AN HOUR.

36:23.882 --> 36:24.916
IF THERE'S
NOTHING BY THEN,

36:24.950 --> 36:29.187
THEN WE'LL LEAVE YOU
TO LEARN WHAT YOU CAN.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.602
MMM.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.004
UGH! PLEASE, GOD,
DON'T HURT ME.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.639
PLEASE.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.944
UHH.
