01:30.480 --> 01:31.106
Quick.

01:31.356 --> 01:33.149
We can't hold them back much longer.

01:36.528 --> 01:37.153
Hurry.

01:40.991 --> 01:42.033
- Come on!
- Get up!

01:50.375 --> 01:51.001
Quick!

01:56.756 --> 01:57.382
Faster!

02:10.478 --> 02:12.397
Open the doors. Come on, quickly!

02:40.300 --> 02:42.260
Just read them the sentence.

02:46.306 --> 02:50.185
The sentence of the court
is that in two days hence

02:50.352 --> 02:54.522
the perfumer journeyman
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille

02:55.607 --> 02:57.942
shall be bound to a wooden cross

02:58.401 --> 03:00.570
with his face raised toward heaven.

03:03.156 --> 03:05.075
And whilst still alive

03:05.617 --> 03:08.870
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod

03:11.498 --> 03:14.501
breaking the joints of his arms,

03:15.585 --> 03:17.128
his shoulders,

03:18.129 --> 03:19.172
his hips,

03:19.798 --> 03:20.799
his legs.

03:23.134 --> 03:27.263
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead

03:27.972 --> 03:30.642
and all customary acts of mercy

03:31.059 --> 03:33.478
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

03:43.196 --> 03:45.365
<i>In 18th-century France,</i>

03:45.657 --> 03:47.492
<i>there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted</i>

03:47.659 --> 03:50.662
<i>and notorious personages
of his time.</i>

03:52.038 --> 03:54.624
<i>His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,</i>

03:55.834 --> 03:58.253
<i>and if his name has been
forgotten today, it is</i>

03:58.670 --> 04:02.841
<i>for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain</i>

04:03.008 --> 04:05.510
<i>that leaves no trace in history:</i>

04:10.598 --> 04:13.393
<i>To the fleeting realm of scent.</i>

04:27.782 --> 04:29.451
<i>In the period of which we speak,</i>

04:29.617 --> 04:32.162
<i>there reigned
in the cities a stench</i>

04:32.329 --> 04:35.081
<i>barely conceivable to us
modern men and women.</i>

04:36.499 --> 04:39.294
<i>Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris,</i>

04:39.461 --> 04:42.047
<i>for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.</i>

04:42.964 --> 04:46.634
<i>And nowhere in Paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant</i>

04:46.801 --> 04:48.845
<i>than in the city's fish market.</i>

04:50.805 --> 04:53.224
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

04:54.726 --> 04:58.772
<i>It was here, then, on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom,</i>

04:59.022 --> 05:00.857
<i>that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille</i>

05:01.024 --> 05:03.777
<i>was born
on the 17th of July, 1738.</i>

05:28.885 --> 05:31.054
<i>It was his mother's fifth birth.</i>

05:31.221 --> 05:33.807
<i>She'd delivered them all here
under her fishstand,</i>

05:33.973 --> 05:37.018
<i>and all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths,</i>

05:37.185 --> 05:38.228
You all right?

05:39.104 --> 05:43.274
<i>And the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river.</i>

05:44.192 --> 05:46.111
<i>It would be
much the same today</i>

05:47.487 --> 05:48.613
<i>but then,</i>

05:49.239 --> 05:51.992
<i>Jean-Baptiste chose differently.</i>

06:25.942 --> 06:26.985
What's that noise?

06:28.903 --> 06:30.238
- It's a baby.
- What's going on here?

06:34.909 --> 06:36.286
It's a newborn.

06:36.870 --> 06:38.121
Where's its mother?

06:39.831 --> 06:40.915
She was just here.

06:43.043 --> 06:46.004
She tried to kill it.
Her own child.

06:46.796 --> 06:48.715
She tried to kill her baby!

06:50.425 --> 06:51.885
There! There she is!

06:52.344 --> 06:53.762
Stop! Stop where you are!

06:53.928 --> 06:54.888
Murderer!

06:55.430 --> 06:58.975
<i>Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips</i>

06:59.225 --> 07:01.394
<i>sent his mother to the gallows</i>

07:05.065 --> 07:07.651
<i>and Jean-Baptiste,
by official order,</i>

07:08.735 --> 07:10.779
<i>to the orphanage
of Madame Gaillard.</i>

07:14.949 --> 07:16.326
How many today?

07:16.701 --> 07:18.662
Four. Well, three and a half.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.086
As usual, more dead than alive.

07:26.419 --> 07:28.004
Just take the money and sign.

07:36.846 --> 07:37.889
Make room.

07:39.474 --> 07:41.309
- Where?
- Move!

07:43.478 --> 07:45.063
Go on, now.

07:56.282 --> 07:57.158
Is it dead?

08:24.769 --> 08:26.771
That's not staying in my bed.

08:27.105 --> 08:29.941
- Let's throw it out, then.
- What if it screams?

08:31.192 --> 08:32.318
Let's just kill it.

08:51.463 --> 08:53.214
Harder! Push!

08:55.008 --> 08:56.509
What are you doing?

09:05.935 --> 09:10.023
<i>For Mme Gaillard, Grenouille was a
source of income, like any other.</i>

09:10.857 --> 09:12.067
<i>The children, however,
sensed at once</i>

09:12.817 --> 09:16.321
<i>that there was something
different about him.</i>

09:33.254 --> 09:37.425
<i>By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.</i>

09:38.927 --> 09:43.098
<i>But he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind.</i>

10:46.661 --> 10:48.872
<i>It was not that the other
children hated him,</i>

10:50.540 --> 10:52.959
<i>they felt unnerved by him.</i>

10:57.297 --> 11:01.343
<i>Increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell</i>

11:01.509 --> 11:05.096
<i>was a gift that had been
given to him, and him alone.</i>

11:14.314 --> 11:17.400
<i>When Jean-Baptiste
did finally learn to speak</i>

11:17.567 --> 11:20.904
<i>he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate</i>

11:21.071 --> 11:25.075
<i>for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself.</i>

11:29.954 --> 11:30.830
Wood.

11:37.295 --> 11:38.338
Warm wood.

11:40.006 --> 11:40.799
Grass.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.968
Wet grass.

11:44.469 --> 11:45.553
Stones.

11:46.513 --> 11:47.722
Warm stones.

11:50.850 --> 11:51.476
Water.

11:53.978 --> 11:55.230
Cold water.

12:01.987 --> 12:03.321
Frog.

12:05.907 --> 12:07.033
Wet stones.

12:08.201 --> 12:11.496
Big, wet frog stones.

12:13.623 --> 12:14.290
Something.

12:16.960 --> 12:17.836
Something.

12:18.837 --> 12:19.713
Something.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.011
<i>By 13, Mme Gaillard no longer
had room for Jean-Baptiste</i>

12:26.177 --> 12:28.555
<i>and therefore
decided to sell him.</i>

12:28.722 --> 12:29.347
Come on.

12:33.184 --> 12:34.060
Ten francs.

12:36.312 --> 12:39.482
<i>From his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man...</i>

12:39.649 --> 12:41.860
<i>Seven, and not one sou more.</i>

12:42.068 --> 12:44.904
<i>... Grenouille knew that
his life in Grimal's tannery</i>

12:45.071 --> 12:48.199
<i>would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish.</i>

12:52.245 --> 12:54.372
<i>Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard,</i>

12:58.209 --> 13:00.378
<i>the bargain was short-lived.</i>

13:06.718 --> 13:10.430
<i>Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years</i>

13:11.306 --> 13:14.976
<i>but Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.</i>

13:15.810 --> 13:17.354
<i>He adjusted to his new fate</i>

13:17.520 --> 13:20.774
<i>and became a paragon
of docility and diligence.</i>

13:20.940 --> 13:24.903
<i>Slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.</i>

13:26.655 --> 13:30.533
<i>Gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery,</i>

13:31.910 --> 13:36.081
<i>where a Utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him.</i>

14:01.064 --> 14:01.690
Grenouille!

14:06.152 --> 14:09.280
Come with us. I'm taking you
to town for delivery.

14:10.407 --> 14:13.076
<i>Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed.</i>

14:13.410 --> 14:14.577
<i>He was alive</i>

14:15.662 --> 14:18.748
<i>and at last he was
in his element.</i>

14:58.330 --> 14:59.331
<i>He was not choosy.</i>

15:00.957 --> 15:05.128
<i>He did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad,</i>

15:07.172 --> 15:08.590
<i>at least not yet.</i>

15:12.260 --> 15:13.720
<i>He was very greedy.</i>

15:14.929 --> 15:19.100
<i>The goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors.</i>

15:21.102 --> 15:25.106
<i>His only condition being,
that they were new ones.</i>

15:28.068 --> 15:31.571
<i>Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel</i>

15:31.738 --> 15:35.867
<i>which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces.</i>

15:53.343 --> 15:54.010
Grenouille!

15:58.390 --> 15:59.015
Come on!

16:03.853 --> 16:04.521
Get your ass over here!

16:07.941 --> 16:11.027
He needs two dozen skins
by next week. Can you do that?

16:11.945 --> 16:14.531
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, come with me.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.431
What is it called?

17:21.765 --> 17:24.851
"Amor and Psyche", madame.
My latest creation.

17:25.852 --> 17:27.311
May I try it?

17:27.771 --> 17:29.814
If you'll allow me, mademoiselle.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.574
Sheer heaven!

17:43.119 --> 17:46.456
Monsieur Pelissier,
you are truly an artiste.

19:23.386 --> 19:26.139
Please, take them.
I've got far too many.

20:15.689 --> 20:16.690
What do you want?

20:26.199 --> 20:27.075
Want to buy some?

20:41.089 --> 20:42.382
Two for a sou.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.967
Next time you run off like that,
I'll kill you!

27:03.179 --> 27:05.765
<i>That night, he could not sleep.</i>

27:07.559 --> 27:11.730
<i>The intoxicating power of the
girl's scent made it clear to him</i>

27:11.896 --> 27:16.067
<i>why he'd come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.</i>

27:17.694 --> 27:21.865
<i>The purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny.</i>

27:23.742 --> 27:26.202
<i>He would learn
how to preserve scent</i>

27:26.828 --> 27:30.623
<i>so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty.</i>

27:55.398 --> 27:58.860
<i>There were about a dozen
perfumers in Paris in those days.</i>

28:00.111 --> 28:04.282
<i>One of them, the once-celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,</i>

28:04.449 --> 28:07.994
<i>had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called Pont au Change</i>

28:08.161 --> 28:11.247
<i>on his arrival in Paris
over thirty years ago.</i>

28:12.040 --> 28:16.086
<i>To be sure, at one time in
his youth, Baldini had created</i>

28:16.461 --> 28:20.382
<i>several truly great perfumes,
to which he owed his fortune.</i>

28:22.092 --> 28:24.552
<i>But now Baldini was</i>

28:24.719 --> 28:26.846
<i>out of touch, out of fashion,</i>

28:27.013 --> 28:30.767
<i>and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came.</i>

28:32.686 --> 28:34.688
- Chénier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

28:34.896 --> 28:35.939
Put on your wig.

28:37.148 --> 28:38.316
Put on your wig!

28:40.860 --> 28:41.695
You going out?

28:42.278 --> 28:44.531
I wish to retire to my study
for a few hours

28:44.698 --> 28:47.200
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

28:47.409 --> 28:48.994
Will you be creating a new
perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

28:50.120 --> 28:52.163
Correct. For Count Verhamont.

28:52.872 --> 28:56.543
He has asked for something like...
I think he said it was called

28:57.377 --> 29:01.548
Amor and Psyche from that swindler
in the Rue Saint André des Arts.

29:02.132 --> 29:02.757
Pelissier?

29:03.174 --> 29:05.260
Pelissier, that's him.

29:07.137 --> 29:08.638
Amor and Psyche!

29:13.560 --> 29:14.311
Do you know it?

29:14.477 --> 29:17.397
Oh, yes. You can smell it
everywhere these days, monsieur.

29:18.732 --> 29:19.983
On every street corner.

29:21.484 --> 29:24.612
In fact, I just
purchased you a sample.

29:26.656 --> 29:28.074
In case you wanted to test it.

29:31.453 --> 29:34.289
What on earth makes you think I'd
be interested in testing it?

29:36.374 --> 29:38.918
You're right.
It's nothing special.

29:39.461 --> 29:42.297
Actually
it's a very common scent.

29:42.839 --> 29:45.675
I believe the head chord
contains lime oil.

29:47.802 --> 29:51.097
Really? And the heart chord?

29:51.973 --> 29:53.892
Orange blossom, I believe.

29:54.809 --> 29:57.479
And civet in the base chord,

29:57.646 --> 29:59.189
but, you know,
I cannot say for sure.

29:59.356 --> 30:02.233
Well, I couldn't care less
what that bungler Pelissier

30:02.400 --> 30:04.694
- slops into his perfumes.
- Naturally not, monsieur.

30:05.528 --> 30:08.573
And I am thinking of creating
something for Count Verhamont

30:09.449 --> 30:11.910
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

30:13.203 --> 30:14.954
I'm sure it will,
Monsieur Baldini.

30:16.164 --> 30:19.751
Take charge of the shop, Chénier,
and don't let anyone come near me.

30:20.210 --> 30:23.046
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.090
Is there anything else you need?

31:08.383 --> 31:10.010
Inspiration, perhaps.

31:10.468 --> 31:11.845
Ah, my Giuseppe.

31:14.472 --> 31:16.975
You are still
the great perfumer Baldini.

32:12.864 --> 32:13.782
Wonderful.

32:18.119 --> 32:19.663
He did it again.

32:27.462 --> 32:28.797
Lime oil.

32:32.425 --> 32:33.760
Orange blossom,

32:34.719 --> 32:35.345
to be sure.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.935
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

32:44.187 --> 32:44.938
No.

32:47.107 --> 32:48.149
Or could be cinnamon?

32:50.902 --> 32:51.528
It's gone.

32:55.782 --> 32:56.408
Cinnamon.

32:57.951 --> 32:58.827
It's not cinnamon.

33:03.248 --> 33:03.873
Cloves.

33:04.499 --> 33:05.125
No.

33:06.334 --> 33:07.210
Musk?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.044
No.

33:49.210 --> 33:50.253
Who's there?

33:50.628 --> 33:52.380
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

33:55.925 --> 33:57.552
I've got the goatskins
you ordered.

34:04.059 --> 34:04.809
Follow me.

34:11.399 --> 34:12.025
This way.

34:46.935 --> 34:47.601
There.

34:48.478 --> 34:49.270
Lay them there.

34:59.114 --> 35:01.449
Tell your master
that the skins are fine.

35:01.616 --> 35:03.827
I'll come by in the next
few days and pay for them.

35:05.161 --> 35:05.954
Yes, Monsieur.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.005
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

35:16.923 --> 35:18.675
Why, of course and so it shall.

35:19.634 --> 35:21.428
With Amor & Psyche
by Pelissier?

35:26.599 --> 35:30.228
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

35:31.313 --> 35:32.605
It's all over you.

35:33.189 --> 35:35.317
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands...

35:35.483 --> 35:37.569
It's bad, Amor & Psyche
is, Master.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.279
There's too much rosemary in it.

35:39.446 --> 35:40.613
And too much of...

35:42.324 --> 35:44.117
that and that.

35:47.454 --> 35:50.540
Bergamot and Patchouli?

35:50.790 --> 35:51.416
Pat...?

35:52.834 --> 35:53.501
Patchouli.

35:53.835 --> 35:54.711
Patchouli.

36:00.467 --> 36:01.092
What else?

36:05.221 --> 36:05.889
That and that.

36:08.516 --> 36:09.267
That and that.

36:19.486 --> 36:20.695
Orange blossom,

36:22.530 --> 36:23.156
lime...

36:24.741 --> 36:25.992
- Rosemary.
- Musk.

36:29.954 --> 36:31.122
And cloves?

36:31.581 --> 36:32.290
And this.

36:41.758 --> 36:44.094
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

36:44.344 --> 36:47.305
- Storax.
- Storax.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.190
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man.

36:57.357 --> 36:59.651
My nose knows all the smells
in the world.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.654
It's the best nose in Paris,
only I don't know the names.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.280
I need to learn the names,
learn them all...

37:04.447 --> 37:05.573
No, no, no!

37:05.782 --> 37:07.492
You dont interrupt me
when I'm speaking.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.619
You are both impertinent
and insolent.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.956
Even I don't know every scent.

37:15.625 --> 37:18.795
I've, of course, known for some time
the ingredients of Amor & Psyche.

37:18.962 --> 37:23.008
But all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose, nothing else.

37:25.051 --> 37:28.054
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer

37:29.097 --> 37:30.890
to detect the exact formula,

37:31.641 --> 37:33.476
which notes, which chords,

37:33.685 --> 37:35.979
and in what precise measurements.

37:37.731 --> 37:40.775
Could you tell me the exact
formula of Amor & Psyche?

37:43.653 --> 37:44.863
Best-nose-in-Paris!

37:50.618 --> 37:51.328
Speak up!

37:53.121 --> 37:54.289
You see, you can't. Can you?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.082
And I'll tell you why.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.003
Because talent means
next to nothing,

38:02.547 --> 38:05.050
while experience acquired

38:05.550 --> 38:08.678
in humility and hard work
means everything.

38:13.516 --> 38:15.644
I don't know what a formula is,

38:16.394 --> 38:18.647
but I can make Amor & Psyche
for you now.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.610
And you think ljust let you
slop around in my laboratory

38:23.777 --> 38:25.904
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

38:26.237 --> 38:26.863
You?

38:28.031 --> 38:28.657
Yes.

38:29.157 --> 38:30.367
Now pay attention!

38:33.995 --> 38:35.538
What is your name, anyway?

38:38.041 --> 38:39.250
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

38:42.170 --> 38:44.130
Very well,
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,

38:46.633 --> 38:49.678
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion.

38:50.011 --> 38:52.847
Your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you

38:53.223 --> 38:54.891
to learn the virtue of humility.

38:55.058 --> 38:58.019
- How much do you want me to make?
- How much of what...?

38:58.395 --> 38:59.980
How much Amor & Psyche do you want?

39:02.899 --> 39:04.275
Shall I fill this flask?

39:04.693 --> 39:06.444
No! You shall not!

39:16.287 --> 39:17.330
You may fill this one.

39:17.664 --> 39:18.623
Yes, Master.

39:22.252 --> 39:23.670
But, Master Baldini...

39:24.879 --> 39:27.215
You must let me do it in my own way.

39:27.882 --> 39:28.883
As you please.

39:34.973 --> 39:35.598
No!

39:36.349 --> 39:40.437
Don't drop it. That's pure alcohol.
You want to blow up the building?

39:43.481 --> 39:45.025
You have to measure it first!

40:33.782 --> 40:35.617
Stop, stop it!

40:35.867 --> 40:37.327
That's enough!

40:37.827 --> 40:38.953
You know nothing!

40:39.663 --> 40:42.207
Essential oils are always
to be mixed first,

40:42.791 --> 40:44.250
then the alcohol added

40:44.459 --> 40:47.462
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that!

40:47.962 --> 40:50.882
I must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish!

40:53.551 --> 40:54.386
It's all done.

41:40.974 --> 41:42.267
This is Amor & Psyche!

41:44.019 --> 41:45.979
But it's not
a good perfume, Master.

41:47.856 --> 41:51.067
If you let me again, Master,
I'll make it more better.

43:06.476 --> 43:08.478
Now it's a really good perfume.

43:15.694 --> 43:17.696
Don't you want
to smell it, Master?

43:17.862 --> 43:19.864
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

43:20.031 --> 43:22.409
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

43:24.744 --> 43:26.538
- But, Master...
- Go! Now!

43:42.262 --> 43:44.389
Can I come to work
for you, master? Can I?

43:47.309 --> 43:48.601
Let me think about it.

43:48.768 --> 43:49.394
Master!

43:51.396 --> 43:54.524
I have to learn
how to keep smell!

43:55.900 --> 43:56.609
What?

43:58.194 --> 43:59.529
Can you teach me that?

44:00.947 --> 44:02.741
I shall have to think
about it. Now, go.

44:49.704 --> 44:50.580
I love you.

44:57.712 --> 44:59.839
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

45:07.597 --> 45:08.431
Grenouille!

45:09.474 --> 45:11.768
<i>Grimal's transaction</i>

45:11.935 --> 45:14.354
<i>had a profound effect
on all three parties.</i>

45:18.024 --> 45:20.694
<i>Not least upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.</i>

45:23.905 --> 45:27.367
<i>As for Giuseppe Baldini,
the acquisition of Grenouille</i>

45:27.534 --> 45:30.829
<i>miraculously transformed
his dwindling business</i>

45:30.996 --> 45:33.665
<i>even surpassing its former glory.</i>

45:42.007 --> 45:43.800
<i>While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,</i>

45:43.967 --> 45:46.553
<i>the mysterious secrets
of the perfumer's craft</i>

45:47.137 --> 45:48.763
<i>began to unfold.</i>

45:55.061 --> 45:57.731
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

45:57.897 --> 46:01.067
Just like a musical chord,
a perfume chord contains

46:01.234 --> 46:02.402
four essences

46:02.569 --> 46:06.406
or notes, carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

46:06.698 --> 46:09.534
Each perfume contains three chords:

46:09.701 --> 46:11.703
The head, the heart and the base,

46:12.287 --> 46:14.581
necessitating twelve notes in all.

46:15.498 --> 46:17.500
The head chord contains

46:17.667 --> 46:20.211
the first impression,
lasting a few minutes

46:20.378 --> 46:22.422
before giving way
to the heart chord,

46:22.589 --> 46:26.009
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

46:26.176 --> 46:28.511
Finally, the base chord,

46:29.304 --> 46:32.599
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

46:37.395 --> 46:40.357
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians
believed that one can only create

46:40.523 --> 46:44.444
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note,

46:44.986 --> 46:48.573
one final essence
that will ring out

46:49.491 --> 46:51.368
and dominate the others.

46:54.079 --> 46:58.249
Legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb

46:58.875 --> 47:02.504
and when it was opened
a perfume was released.

47:02.671 --> 47:05.632
After all those thousands of years,

47:05.799 --> 47:09.803
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power,

47:09.970 --> 47:12.514
that for one single moment

47:12.681 --> 47:16.851
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise.

47:19.145 --> 47:21.606
Twelve essences could be identified,

47:22.816 --> 47:24.109
but the 13th,

47:25.318 --> 47:26.444
the vital one,

47:28.488 --> 47:30.365
could never be determined.

47:32.325 --> 47:33.118
Why not?

47:35.662 --> 47:37.789
Why not?
What do you mean, why not?

47:39.332 --> 47:41.918
Because it's a legend, numbskull!

47:43.169 --> 47:44.462
What's a legend?

47:47.048 --> 47:47.882
Never mind.

48:30.300 --> 48:31.176
Jean-Baptiste.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.636
Jean-Baptiste?

48:38.892 --> 48:40.018
What's the matter?

48:40.602 --> 48:41.269
Master,

48:42.187 --> 48:44.481
I have to learn
how to capture scent.

48:47.442 --> 48:48.652
What are you talking about?

48:49.194 --> 48:51.905
I have to learn
how to capture scent

48:52.072 --> 48:53.490
and reprise it forever.

48:54.157 --> 48:55.367
You mean, preserve.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.077
You have to teach me that.

48:57.827 --> 48:59.245
All right.
Calm down, my boy.

49:00.080 --> 49:00.747
Calm down.

49:01.790 --> 49:02.999
We have work to do.

49:05.251 --> 49:07.587
"The soul of beings is their scent."

49:08.963 --> 49:10.340
You said that, master.

49:12.008 --> 49:12.717
Did I?

49:13.593 --> 49:15.679
I will make you
as many perfumes as you want

49:15.887 --> 49:17.472
but you have to teach me

49:17.847 --> 49:19.975
how to capture
the smell of all things.

49:21.768 --> 49:22.686
Can you do that?

49:24.479 --> 49:26.523
Well, naturally.

49:26.856 --> 49:28.775
Then teach me
everything you know

49:32.404 --> 49:34.781
and I'll make you the best
perfume in the whole world.

49:53.049 --> 49:54.968
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste,

49:55.135 --> 49:58.179
ten thousand roses to produce

49:58.346 --> 50:01.391
one single ounce of essential oil.

50:04.894 --> 50:08.648
Now, keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew

50:09.858 --> 50:13.403
while I set up the alembic.
And take care not to damage them.

50:13.695 --> 50:16.823
We have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact.

50:36.051 --> 50:36.801
Perfect.

50:37.927 --> 50:39.512
Now, help me
with the Moor's head.

50:52.859 --> 50:54.402
Temperature is vital.

50:54.569 --> 50:58.281
When the quicksilver is here,
the heat is precisely correct

50:58.448 --> 51:01.076
and the oil will gradually rise.

51:03.703 --> 51:07.832
Note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising.

51:08.667 --> 51:11.503
You will observe how cold water

51:12.128 --> 51:14.756
is pumped through here

51:17.133 --> 51:20.428
allowing the essence
to condense here

51:20.595 --> 51:24.683
until it finally appears

51:26.726 --> 51:27.519
here.

51:28.895 --> 51:32.107
Of course,
out on the hillside above Grasse

51:32.273 --> 51:34.985
we had only to bellow
pure, fresh air.

51:36.444 --> 51:39.531
Ah, Grasse. What a town.

51:41.491 --> 51:43.201
The Rome of scents.

51:44.536 --> 51:46.955
The Promised Land of perfume.

51:48.665 --> 51:52.836
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer

51:53.378 --> 51:57.549
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

52:00.302 --> 52:02.804
Not to worry.
Happens all the time.

52:04.806 --> 52:05.557
To Grasse.

52:24.242 --> 52:24.868
Master.

52:26.578 --> 52:27.203
Look.

52:33.168 --> 52:35.128
The very soul of the rose.

53:29.724 --> 53:30.475
Jean-Baptiste.

53:34.312 --> 53:35.063
What's wrong?

53:37.107 --> 53:38.108
Jean-Baptiste.

53:41.528 --> 53:42.612
What have you done?

53:43.363 --> 53:45.323
- You lied.
- What?

53:46.366 --> 53:47.283
You lied to me.

53:48.660 --> 53:51.413
How dare you talk to me like that.

53:52.831 --> 53:55.583
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

53:56.459 --> 53:57.627
And so you can.

54:02.090 --> 54:03.216
What do you smell?

54:04.509 --> 54:05.635
What do you smell?

54:11.182 --> 54:11.891
Nothing.

54:15.478 --> 54:17.355
What were you expecting to smell?

54:17.689 --> 54:18.523
Glass.

54:19.774 --> 54:21.359
But glass doesn't smell.

54:21.776 --> 54:23.570
Course it does.
What's this?

54:29.075 --> 54:30.452
I don't smell a thing.

54:31.661 --> 54:33.538
It should smell like copper!

54:33.788 --> 54:34.539
Enough!

54:37.834 --> 54:41.212
You were trying to distill
the smell of copper?

54:41.838 --> 54:44.841
Iron? Glass? Copper?

54:49.262 --> 54:50.722
What else did you try?

54:54.684 --> 54:55.644
No!

54:57.020 --> 55:00.065
Have you gone completely insane?

55:00.982 --> 55:02.942
You told me I had to experiment.

55:03.777 --> 55:05.904
Experiment? Experiment?

55:06.613 --> 55:08.531
But not with the cat.

55:11.910 --> 55:13.620
What kind of a human being are you?

55:14.537 --> 55:15.997
Don't you know anything?

55:16.581 --> 55:18.667
You can no more distill
the scent of a cat

55:18.833 --> 55:20.794
than you can distill
the scent of you or me.

55:32.055 --> 55:32.847
I can't?

55:33.264 --> 55:34.391
Of course not!

55:42.315 --> 55:43.858
<i>He is in stadio ultimo.</i>

55:44.025 --> 55:45.360
- What?
- He's dying.

55:45.694 --> 55:47.237
Is there nothing you can do?

55:47.696 --> 55:50.907
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

55:51.408 --> 55:53.368
Well, my fee is 50 francs.

55:53.535 --> 55:54.661
50 francs?

55:54.828 --> 55:57.789
You charlatan!
You can't even name the disease!

56:01.835 --> 56:03.712
No! Jean-Baptiste!

56:06.256 --> 56:07.674
You cannot do this to me.

56:08.717 --> 56:12.887
Not now. Not yet.

56:24.733 --> 56:25.567
Is there

56:30.822 --> 56:32.032
any other way

56:34.284 --> 56:37.078
to preserve smell
besides distill it?

56:37.537 --> 56:38.747
Jean-Baptiste?

56:44.294 --> 56:45.462
Is there, master?

56:47.047 --> 56:50.050
Well, yes, I believe there is.

56:51.760 --> 56:52.761
What is it?

56:55.597 --> 56:59.267
It is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage.

57:02.228 --> 57:03.188
Can you teach me?

57:07.108 --> 57:09.903
Not even I am intimate
with its secrets.

57:13.239 --> 57:15.325
But could I learn it in Grasse?

57:16.576 --> 57:19.245
- Well...
- Could I?

57:25.669 --> 57:27.462
Where else but in Grasse?

57:35.136 --> 57:37.555
<i>Within a week Grenouille
was well again,</i>

57:37.722 --> 57:41.893
<i>but to travel to Grasse to find
ajob he needed journey papers.</i>

57:43.478 --> 57:45.230
<i>Baldini agreed to provide them</i>

57:45.605 --> 57:47.482
<i>on condition that
Grenouille left him</i>

57:47.649 --> 57:51.111
<i>not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes.</i>

57:52.320 --> 57:56.074
<i>Grenouille did not mind. He
could have given him a thousand.</i>

58:02.372 --> 58:06.334
<i>The morning of Grenouille's
departure, Baldini was pleased.</i>

58:06.626 --> 58:10.505
<i>At last, he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work.</i>

58:11.298 --> 58:14.134
<i>He could not remember
a happier day.</i>

58:14.926 --> 58:17.971
<i>Deeply satisfied,
he went back to sleep</i>

58:18.138 --> 58:20.890
<i>and awoke no more in this life.</i>

58:40.577 --> 58:44.748
<i>With every step he took from
the city, the happier he felt.</i>

58:45.832 --> 58:50.003
<i>The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner,</i>

58:50.754 --> 58:53.798
<i>and at last he was able
to breathe freely.</i>

58:57.552 --> 58:59.929
<i>There were two ways
to reach Grasse.</i>

59:00.847 --> 59:04.059
<i>The first followed the winding
roads through the villages</i>

59:04.225 --> 59:08.355
<i>while the second lead across
the mountains, down into Provence.</i>

59:10.690 --> 59:12.525
<i>The choice was quite easy.</i>

59:16.905 --> 59:19.157
<i>Thus his nose led him
ever higher,</i>

59:19.366 --> 59:21.660
<i>ever further from mankind,</i>

59:22.577 --> 59:26.748
<i>more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude.</i>

01:00:06.538 --> 01:00:10.291
<i>Grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found</i>

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:14.045
<i>a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent.</i>

01:00:19.426 --> 01:00:23.596
<i>Spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone.</i>

01:00:27.309 --> 01:00:29.769
<i>There was something sacred
about this place.</i>

01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:36.943
<i>No longer distracted
by anything external,</i>

01:00:37.485 --> 01:00:41.323
<i>he was finally able to bask
in his own existence</i>

01:00:43.867 --> 01:00:45.660
<i>and found it splendid.</i>

01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:58.256
<i>After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions</i>

01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:03.470
<i>and, indeed, might have done
so altogether.</i>

01:01:18.693 --> 01:01:19.444
Hello?

01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:24.866
Hello?

01:01:28.203 --> 01:01:28.953
Hello?

01:01:47.472 --> 01:01:50.266
<i>There were a thousand
smells in his clothes.</i>

01:01:50.433 --> 01:01:53.228
<i>The smell of sand,
stone, moss.</i>

01:01:53.395 --> 01:01:56.606
<i>Even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.</i>

01:01:56.773 --> 01:01:58.942
<i>Only one smell was not there.</i>

01:02:02.195 --> 01:02:03.321
<i>His own.</i>

01:02:40.775 --> 01:02:44.946
<i>For the first time, Grenouille
realized he had no smell.</i>

01:02:47.532 --> 01:02:51.536
<i>He realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone.</i>

01:02:52.579 --> 01:02:56.166
<i>What he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion.</i>

01:02:57.375 --> 01:03:00.712
<i>It was as though
he did not exist.</i>

01:03:06.551 --> 01:03:10.680
<i>By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.</i>

01:03:11.306 --> 01:03:13.475
<i>He must continue
his journey to Grasse.</i>

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:17.979
<i>There he would teach the world
not only that he existed,</i>

01:03:18.146 --> 01:03:19.898
<i>that he was someone,</i>

01:03:20.273 --> 01:03:22.275
<i>but that he was exceptional.</i>

01:03:26.696 --> 01:03:28.073
<i>And with this decision</i>

01:03:29.032 --> 01:03:32.702
<i>it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him.</i>

01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:56.244
Go in.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.346
Laura?

01:08:09.938 --> 01:08:10.563
Laura?

01:08:11.898 --> 01:08:12.774
Coming, Papa.

01:08:50.478 --> 01:08:52.397
Haven't seen you here before.

01:08:54.357 --> 01:08:55.817
It's my first season.

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:59.237
Picking together
is always more fun.

01:09:01.156 --> 01:09:02.866
They say you pick
everything you find.

01:09:47.702 --> 01:09:48.328
Idiot!

01:09:48.995 --> 01:09:51.288
How many times have I told you
not to cram the blossoms in

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:54.876
like you're stuffing a chicken?

01:09:55.126 --> 01:09:56.878
Watch how Grenouille does it.

01:09:59.047 --> 01:10:01.216
Look how skillfully
he handles them.

01:10:01.716 --> 01:10:05.428
The whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly.

01:10:05.595 --> 01:10:07.722
In their sleep, as it were.

01:10:07.889 --> 01:10:12.018
Handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

01:10:12.936 --> 01:10:14.104
If you say so, Madame.

01:10:17.399 --> 01:10:19.651
You. Check the jonquil blossoms.

01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:24.781
They need more time.

01:10:27.909 --> 01:10:29.160
Do what I say!

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.706
Stop it!

01:11:16.124 --> 01:11:16.958
I'm not in the mood.

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:18.543
Are you sure?

01:11:20.003 --> 01:11:21.379
Of course I'm sure.

01:11:28.303 --> 01:11:29.512
I said...

01:11:32.515 --> 01:11:33.475
...no!

01:11:45.195 --> 01:11:46.279
Suit yourself

01:11:50.116 --> 01:11:50.784
Lucien?

01:11:55.038 --> 01:11:56.331
Fetch me back the ladder.

01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:57.666
Fetch it yourself.

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:10.595
Lucien?

01:12:14.557 --> 01:12:15.392
Lucien!

01:12:26.903 --> 01:12:27.529
Lucien?

01:12:31.324 --> 01:12:31.950
Lucien?

01:12:51.511 --> 01:12:52.137
Lucien?

01:13:50.445 --> 01:13:54.324
Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi.
She here?

01:13:58.286 --> 01:13:58.995
She's busy.

01:14:07.087 --> 01:14:08.880
Seems such a waste to boil them.

01:14:10.757 --> 01:14:12.300
Or whatever you do with them.

01:14:17.973 --> 01:14:19.474
So what do you do with them?

01:14:21.059 --> 01:14:22.936
Warm them in animal fat.

01:14:23.395 --> 01:14:26.982
- What for?
- The fat soaks up their scent.

01:14:27.774 --> 01:14:28.650
Then what?

01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:33.571
Then I cool it to a pomade

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.035
and then I filter it before...

01:14:43.748 --> 01:14:44.666
Before what?

01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:48.920
Before I add in alcohol and
other essences to make a perfume.

01:14:49.087 --> 01:14:50.005
Don't touch anything.

01:14:56.261 --> 01:14:57.137
What's in there?

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.514
Nothing. Just flowers.

01:15:01.016 --> 01:15:02.267
- Can I look?
- No.

01:15:02.851 --> 01:15:04.102
Not now. I've got work to do.

01:15:04.394 --> 01:15:05.312
You must go now.

01:15:05.478 --> 01:15:07.814
- Come on. Let me look.
- Don't touch.

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.149
Ah, my tuberoses.

01:15:11.026 --> 01:15:12.319
Morning, Madame.

01:15:12.861 --> 01:15:13.570
Morning.

01:15:17.282 --> 01:15:19.117
Why have you covered the tank?

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.078
It's an experiment, Madame.

01:15:25.373 --> 01:15:27.584
To protect the blossoms
from daylight.

01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:29.878
To preserve the scent better.

01:15:31.212 --> 01:15:32.964
Well, if you say so.

01:15:34.883 --> 01:15:38.053
Come with me. I'll settle
your master's account.

01:15:40.764 --> 01:15:43.183
To preserve
their scent better, you say?

01:15:57.489 --> 01:15:58.782
I don't smell much.

01:16:05.413 --> 01:16:08.917
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

01:16:12.796 --> 01:16:15.840
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

01:16:28.728 --> 01:16:30.021
How much must I pay

01:16:32.816 --> 01:16:34.025
to be with you?

01:16:34.943 --> 01:16:36.528
Depends what you want.

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:51.459
What's that stuff?

01:16:55.755 --> 01:16:57.215
I'm creating a perfume.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.137
Lie down, please.

01:17:22.157 --> 01:17:23.283
It feels horrible.

01:17:24.909 --> 01:17:28.288
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

01:17:29.247 --> 01:17:31.041
Creating a perfume, eh?

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:35.003
Admit it. You're getting
some sort of bang out of this.

01:17:36.004 --> 01:17:36.921
Aren't you?

01:17:38.173 --> 01:17:39.382
I enjoy my work.

01:17:41.509 --> 01:17:42.844
Hold your arm still.

01:17:51.394 --> 01:17:52.854
Don't think
you're gonna tie me up.

01:17:54.397 --> 01:17:55.982
Hold out your arm, please.

01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:05.825
I've come across some
strange men in my time...

01:18:06.076 --> 01:18:08.828
Just relax.

01:18:16.836 --> 01:18:18.797
Holy Mother, what's that?!

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.927
Just for scraping off the fat.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:27.347
- Are you mad?
- Relax. You'll ruin everything.

01:18:28.765 --> 01:18:32.394
If you're frightened, you stink.
Then your perfume will be spoiled.

01:18:32.644 --> 01:18:34.187
I've had enough.

01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:37.774
Here, take your money.

01:18:38.817 --> 01:18:42.195
Basting me up in all this goo.
You think I am a Christmas goose?

01:18:42.487 --> 01:18:43.697
Get out of here!

01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:13.823
Quickly, blow them out
before the roses melt!

01:22:14.032 --> 01:22:16.326
- Roses can't melt, Papa!
- These ones can.

01:22:31.549 --> 01:22:35.720
Now I'd like to propose a toast
to our guest of honour,

01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:38.306
his Excellency,
the Marquis de Montesquieu.

01:22:39.015 --> 01:22:41.685
May our trade
continue to flourish!

01:22:47.107 --> 01:22:48.108
I thank you all

01:22:48.733 --> 01:22:51.486
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first

01:22:51.653 --> 01:22:54.072
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter

01:22:54.406 --> 01:22:57.242
and present her with a small
token of my affection.

01:23:04.749 --> 01:23:05.583
It's beautiful.

01:23:23.518 --> 01:23:25.103
I'm overwhelmed, your Grace.

01:23:25.603 --> 01:23:26.479
"Your Grace"?

01:23:27.814 --> 01:23:31.109
I had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now.

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:36.197
Let's have a game
of hide-and-seek!

01:23:36.364 --> 01:23:38.950
Oh yes! But everyone must play!

01:23:41.202 --> 01:23:43.288
Let the men catch the women.

01:23:50.462 --> 01:23:51.963
Albine! Wait!

01:25:21.553 --> 01:25:23.847
Put me down. Please?

01:25:28.935 --> 01:25:30.562
Now there's no escape.

01:26:01.217 --> 01:26:03.053
Game's over, everybody.

01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:06.222
Laura?

01:26:08.308 --> 01:26:09.643
Time to go in now.

01:26:34.376 --> 01:26:35.210
Laura?

01:26:53.937 --> 01:26:56.439
Albine? Françoise?

01:27:02.195 --> 01:27:04.114
Laura, have you seen the twins?

01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:06.741
No, not since the game started.

01:27:09.619 --> 01:27:11.746
Albine? Françoise?

01:27:22.799 --> 01:27:24.926
Albine? Françoise?

01:27:25.093 --> 01:27:25.719
Jacques?

01:27:27.512 --> 01:27:28.555
Take this way.

01:27:29.347 --> 01:27:30.765
You two with me.

01:27:30.932 --> 01:27:34.519
Your Excellency? Through here.

01:27:39.733 --> 01:27:41.568
Albine! Françoise!

01:28:53.056 --> 01:28:56.184
I told that cretin ten times
to get these ready!

01:28:56.518 --> 01:28:58.228
Don't keep picking on the boy.

01:28:59.521 --> 01:29:01.523
I'll kill him, the useless
little sewer rat!

01:29:02.524 --> 01:29:03.316
Grenouille!

01:29:04.985 --> 01:29:06.319
What are you doing?

01:29:06.486 --> 01:29:08.571
Why aren't the enfleurage
frames...

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.329
Yes, master?

01:29:16.997 --> 01:29:21.084
I mean, would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames?

01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:26.715
Certainly, master.

01:29:42.647 --> 01:29:44.024
Acurfew?

01:29:44.482 --> 01:29:45.900
Are you mad?

01:29:46.067 --> 01:29:49.112
Jasmine can only be picked
before dawn. We all know that.

01:29:49.279 --> 01:29:52.073
This could mean
the ruin of our trade.

01:29:52.365 --> 01:29:53.033
Yours.

01:29:54.075 --> 01:29:55.660
And yours and yours.

01:29:57.162 --> 01:29:59.289
Supposing it's your daughter
next time.

01:30:01.333 --> 01:30:05.003
Of course a curfew is necessary,
but we also have to catch this man

01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:09.341
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks, what he wants.

01:30:09.507 --> 01:30:13.136
I should have thought that
was obvious. Use your imagination.

01:30:13.345 --> 01:30:16.014
And if I were to tell you
that all except the prostitute

01:30:16.181 --> 01:30:18.558
went to their graves
with their chastity intact?

01:30:19.517 --> 01:30:20.644
How would you know?

01:30:20.894 --> 01:30:24.689
The coroner had each girl examined.
They were all found to be virgins.

01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:29.194
Supposing there isn't a next time?

01:30:29.778 --> 01:30:33.448
If we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing.

01:30:35.909 --> 01:30:37.869
So we wait until he's killed,
what? Six?

01:30:38.787 --> 01:30:40.288
Seven? Eight?

01:31:06.064 --> 01:31:08.566
Curfew!
Go back to your homes!

01:31:23.581 --> 01:31:24.708
Gentlemen!

01:31:25.125 --> 01:31:25.917
Gentlemen!

01:31:27.043 --> 01:31:31.006
We have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter.

01:31:31.339 --> 01:31:34.009
I suggest that we ask
for support from Paris.

01:31:34.301 --> 01:31:36.094
Paris won't be smarter than we are.

01:31:36.594 --> 01:31:38.013
We must arrest every Gypsy
in Provence. And every beggar.

01:31:38.471 --> 01:31:40.223
And every man without
a wife and family!

01:31:40.473 --> 01:31:41.308
Listen.

01:31:44.019 --> 01:31:48.106
We have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man.

01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:52.819
Each of his victims
had an especial beauty.

01:31:53.069 --> 01:31:57.157
We know he doesn't want
their virginity, so it seems to me

01:31:57.324 --> 01:32:00.035
that it's their beauty itself
that he wants.

01:32:00.285 --> 01:32:02.954
It's almost as if he's trying
to gather something.

01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:06.750
As if his ambitions
are those of a collector.

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:09.544
A collector? Of what?

01:32:10.795 --> 01:32:11.588
Their hair?

01:32:18.803 --> 01:32:22.974
Whatever it is,
I fear he won't stop killing

01:32:23.266 --> 01:32:26.144
until his collection is complete.

01:32:51.711 --> 01:32:52.420
Monsieur.

01:32:55.632 --> 01:32:59.594
This man is a demon.

01:32:59.844 --> 01:33:02.889
A phantom who cannot be fought
by human means.

01:33:03.056 --> 01:33:07.102
Now, I insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him!

01:33:08.478 --> 01:33:10.146
What good would that do?

01:33:10.563 --> 01:33:13.817
Have you no faith in the power
of our Holy Mother Church?

01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:17.153
This is not a matter of faith.

01:33:17.445 --> 01:33:18.905
There's a murderer out there

01:33:19.114 --> 01:33:22.575
and we must catch him
by using our God-given wits!

01:33:23.368 --> 01:33:26.246
I say until
we submit to Mother Church

01:33:27.122 --> 01:33:29.082
these killings will not cease.

01:33:46.016 --> 01:33:50.186
Citizens of Grasse, we hereby
declare that this murderer,

01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:53.481
this demon in our midst,

01:33:54.065 --> 01:33:58.153
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication.

01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:03.033
Not only has this depraved monster

01:34:03.450 --> 01:34:05.952
robbed us of our daughters,

01:34:06.328 --> 01:34:09.039
the young and fair blossom
of this city,

01:34:09.372 --> 01:34:11.207
and by his wanton acts

01:34:11.791 --> 01:34:15.253
has brought our trade,
our livelihood,

01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.131
our very existence,

01:34:18.506 --> 01:34:21.426
to the brink of eternal darkness.

01:34:23.637 --> 01:34:24.888
We therefore declare

01:34:25.722 --> 01:34:27.724
that this vile viper,

01:34:27.891 --> 01:34:31.311
this ignominious carbuncle,

01:34:31.478 --> 01:34:34.606
this execrable evil in our midst,

01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:38.943
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence,

01:34:40.362 --> 01:34:44.491
rejected from the communion
of Holy Mother Church

01:34:45.116 --> 01:34:47.452
as a disciple of Satan,

01:34:48.787 --> 01:34:50.997
slayer of souls.

01:34:51.164 --> 01:34:51.873
Stand clear!

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.169
An infected limb,
an outsider of the faith

01:34:57.545 --> 01:35:01.091
a necromancer,
a diabolist, a sorcerer

01:35:01.716 --> 01:35:04.010
and a damned heretic.

01:35:05.679 --> 01:35:08.974
Oh, God, in Thy most
merciful spirit,

01:35:10.225 --> 01:35:13.144
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head

01:35:13.979 --> 01:35:17.691
and may the Devil
make soup of his bones.

01:35:18.024 --> 01:35:19.192
Amen.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.570
My Lord! It's a miracle!

01:35:23.697 --> 01:35:25.573
He's been caught!
He's been caught!

01:35:27.617 --> 01:35:30.453
My Lord, the fiend has been caught.

01:35:31.246 --> 01:35:32.956
In the city of Grenoble.

01:35:33.123 --> 01:35:34.624
He's confessed to everything.

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:37.252
He's confessed to everything!

01:35:39.462 --> 01:35:40.588
Hallelujah!

01:35:40.755 --> 01:35:43.091
Hallelujah!

01:35:44.050 --> 01:35:45.510
Praise be to God!

01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:47.679
And we thank Him

01:35:47.846 --> 01:35:51.349
for listening to our prayers
and answering them.

01:35:52.225 --> 01:35:55.061
Amen.

01:35:55.687 --> 01:35:57.856
Amen.

01:36:13.997 --> 01:36:15.707
Just read the report.

01:36:15.874 --> 01:36:17.834
This cannot possibly
be the same man.

01:36:21.087 --> 01:36:25.258
He confessed to everything.
Including the murders in Grasse.

01:36:25.425 --> 01:36:27.719
Yes. Under torture.

01:36:29.304 --> 01:36:30.138
Look. Here.

01:36:31.431 --> 01:36:34.100
He admits to strangling
his victims,

01:36:34.267 --> 01:36:36.978
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them.

01:36:37.145 --> 01:36:40.273
The Grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.610
their hair was carefully cropped,
and not one of them was violated.

01:36:43.777 --> 01:36:44.402
Antoine,

01:36:46.154 --> 01:36:48.573
we're all happy it's over.

01:36:49.532 --> 01:36:50.325
Let it go.

01:37:38.331 --> 01:37:41.209
- Papa, what's the matter?
- We're going home. Now!

01:37:41.376 --> 01:37:42.794
But why? I'm enjoying myself.

01:37:42.961 --> 01:37:46.089
- Don't argue with me, Laura.
- Stop it! I'm going...

01:37:53.847 --> 01:37:54.472
Laura!

01:37:56.224 --> 01:37:57.058
Laura!

01:38:00.603 --> 01:38:01.938
Out of my way!

01:38:02.647 --> 01:38:03.273
Laura!

01:39:00.455 --> 01:39:01.331
Laura!

01:39:02.624 --> 01:39:03.375
Papa!

01:39:09.798 --> 01:39:11.007
I'm so sorry.

01:39:24.938 --> 01:39:27.732
I know you must think me
a very foolish man,

01:39:29.067 --> 01:39:31.027
but try to understand

01:39:32.112 --> 01:39:33.613
you're all I have left.

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:35.657
You don't need to explain, Papa.

01:39:35.824 --> 01:39:38.618
- If anything were to happen to you...
- I know.

01:39:39.411 --> 01:39:42.455
But you must stop worrying
about me all the time.

01:40:03.226 --> 01:40:04.811
Sweet dreams, my love.

01:40:08.982 --> 01:40:10.567
Sweet dreams, Papa.

01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:11.753
Laura!

01:41:22.555 --> 01:41:24.849
Papa, what's the matter?

01:41:29.729 --> 01:41:30.939
Did you open the window?

01:41:33.274 --> 01:41:33.900
No.

01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:35.443
Why?

01:41:38.822 --> 01:41:42.909
Have this letter dispatched to the
Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.419
Stay on the road north
into the mountains.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.230
Did Monsieur Richis leave?

01:42:54.397 --> 01:42:55.023
He did.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.232
Which way?

01:42:57.692 --> 01:42:58.526
North.

01:43:05.533 --> 01:43:07.202
You sure it wasn't south?

01:43:07.369 --> 01:43:10.914
I saw them with my own eyes.
Why do you want to know?

01:43:12.666 --> 01:43:15.251
I said north. North!

01:43:17.671 --> 01:43:18.546
Grenouille!

01:43:21.132 --> 01:43:22.008
Grenouille!

01:43:25.095 --> 01:43:25.971
Grenouille!

01:43:36.731 --> 01:43:37.649
Grenouille!

01:43:54.624 --> 01:43:55.375
Good God!

01:44:52.307 --> 01:44:53.725
Good afternoon, Monsieur.

01:44:54.434 --> 01:44:57.103
Good afternoon. Do you have
anyone else staying here?

01:44:57.729 --> 01:44:58.480
No, Monsieur.

01:44:59.064 --> 01:45:01.483
Then I would like to take
all your rooms for the night.

01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:03.818
It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.

01:45:05.278 --> 01:45:08.865
And tomorrow, at first light, we wish
to be ferried to the lle de Lérin.

01:45:09.616 --> 01:45:13.078
- It's deserted, just a few monks.
- I'm aware of that.

01:45:14.037 --> 01:45:14.746
Very well, Monsieur.

01:45:19.876 --> 01:45:21.503
Our finest room, Mademoiselle.

01:45:24.714 --> 01:45:26.383
With a superb view of the sea.

01:45:27.384 --> 01:45:28.176
One moment.

01:45:34.933 --> 01:45:35.558
Very well.

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.688
Do you have a room next to this one?

01:45:39.854 --> 01:45:43.942
- Yes, but the view is different.
- I have no interest in the view.

01:46:37.537 --> 01:46:41.082
Papa, will you please tell me
now what is happening?

01:46:42.042 --> 01:46:44.210
You haven't said a word all day.

01:46:44.794 --> 01:46:46.630
Why all this secrecy?

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.636
Last night I dreamt you were dead,

01:46:54.179 --> 01:46:56.389
murdered like all the other girls.

01:47:05.982 --> 01:47:09.194
The truth is, I'm convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere.

01:47:11.029 --> 01:47:13.323
All of his victims
were young and beautiful,

01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:15.367
and who is there more beautiful
than you, Laura?

01:47:17.494 --> 01:47:19.204
Whatever his insane scheme,

01:47:19.454 --> 01:47:22.290
it will surely be incomplete
without you.

01:47:31.174 --> 01:47:34.302
I wrote to the Marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage

01:47:34.511 --> 01:47:37.389
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible.

01:47:38.932 --> 01:47:42.060
Until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery.

01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:46.773
And all this because
you had a bad dream?

01:47:47.148 --> 01:47:50.360
- I've made my decision.
- But I don't know if I love him!

01:47:50.777 --> 01:47:53.029
I'm afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice.

01:47:53.196 --> 01:47:55.282
- Papa!
- It's all arranged, Laura.

01:53:45.632 --> 01:53:48.051
On your feet.
Hands in the air!

01:54:34.306 --> 01:54:36.808
Why did you kill my daughter?

01:54:40.937 --> 01:54:41.688
Why?

01:54:45.567 --> 01:54:46.568
I needed her.

01:55:13.345 --> 01:55:15.764
Why did you kill my daughter?

01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.019
I just...

01:55:24.481 --> 01:55:25.607
needed her.

01:55:33.865 --> 01:55:34.908
Very well.

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:39.496
But remember this.

01:55:46.002 --> 01:55:47.545
I will be looking at you

01:55:50.590 --> 01:55:52.342
when you are laid on the cross

01:55:52.509 --> 01:55:56.471
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs.

01:55:59.224 --> 01:56:02.852
And when the crowd has finally tired

01:56:03.019 --> 01:56:05.772
of your screams and wandered home,

01:56:06.022 --> 01:56:09.609
I will climb up through your blood

01:56:12.237 --> 01:56:14.030
and sit beside you.

01:56:16.157 --> 01:56:19.077
I will look deep into your eyes

01:56:21.204 --> 01:56:23.373
and drop by drop

01:56:26.001 --> 01:56:29.754
I will trickle my disgust into them

01:56:31.756 --> 01:56:34.592
like burning acid,

01:56:36.428 --> 01:56:37.721
until

01:56:41.391 --> 01:56:42.684
finally

01:56:46.730 --> 01:56:48.023
you perish.

01:58:48.727 --> 01:58:50.687
Unchain the prisoner.

01:59:01.823 --> 01:59:03.241
That's enough.

01:59:04.826 --> 01:59:06.703
Let him be brought to the scaffold.

01:59:11.916 --> 01:59:12.834
What's that?

02:00:27.075 --> 02:00:28.451
He's over there.

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.648
This man is innocent!

02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:28.571
He is innocent!

02:03:52.739 --> 02:03:53.365
An angel!

02:03:54.699 --> 02:03:55.700
This is no man!

02:03:56.576 --> 02:03:58.161
This is an angel!

02:10:00.065 --> 02:10:01.066
Grenouille!

02:10:07.364 --> 02:10:09.449
You can't fool me!

02:10:58.498 --> 02:10:59.416
Forgive me,

02:11:06.715 --> 02:11:07.799
my son.

02:12:11.154 --> 02:12:15.158
<i>The people of Grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover.</i>

02:12:16.660 --> 02:12:20.080
<i>For many of them,
the experience was so ghastly,</i>

02:12:20.246 --> 02:12:23.875
<i>so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals</i>

02:12:24.668 --> 02:12:27.671
<i>that they literally erased it
from their memories.</i>

02:12:28.797 --> 02:12:31.716
<i>The town council was
in session by the afternoon</i>

02:12:31.883 --> 02:12:34.177
<i>and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant</i>

02:12:34.344 --> 02:12:37.973
<i>to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders.</i>

02:12:39.474 --> 02:12:42.352
<i>The following day,
Dominique Druot was arrested.</i>

02:12:42.519 --> 02:12:46.690
<i>It was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims.</i>

02:12:48.024 --> 02:12:51.611
<i>After fourteen hours of torture,
Druot confessed to everything.</i>

02:12:54.531 --> 02:12:56.950
<i>With that, the case was closed.</i>

02:13:01.204 --> 02:13:05.166
<i>By then, Grenouille was already
half way back to Paris.</i>

02:13:09.254 --> 02:13:13.425
<i>He had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose.</i>

02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:17.512
<i>He could walk to Versailles
and have the King kiss his feet.</i>

02:13:17.971 --> 02:13:22.142
<i>He could write the Pope a letter,
reveal himself as the new Messiah.</i>

02:13:23.268 --> 02:13:25.770
<i>He could do all this
and more if he wanted to.</i>

02:13:26.938 --> 02:13:29.816
<i>He possessed a power stronger
than the power of money,</i>

02:13:29.983 --> 02:13:31.776
<i>or terror, or death.</i>

02:13:32.444 --> 02:13:36.448
<i>The invincible power to command
the love of mankind.</i>

02:13:43.079 --> 02:13:46.166
<i>There was only one thing
the perfume could not do:</i>

02:13:46.416 --> 02:13:49.169
<i>It could not turn him
into a person</i>

02:13:49.336 --> 02:13:51.546
<i>who could love and be loved
like everyone else.</i>

02:13:52.922 --> 02:13:55.383
<i>So, to hell with it, he thought.</i>

02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:57.135
<i>To hell with the world,</i>

02:13:57.427 --> 02:13:58.762
<i>with the perfume,</i>

02:13:59.137 --> 02:14:00.472
<i>with himself.</i>

02:14:03.266 --> 02:14:06.436
<i>On the 25th of June, 1766,</i>

02:14:06.811 --> 02:14:08.480
<i>around 11 o'clock at night,</i>

02:14:09.105 --> 02:14:12.400
<i>Grenouille entered the city
through the Port d'Orleans</i>

02:14:12.567 --> 02:14:14.402
<i>and like a sleep-walker,</i>

02:14:14.903 --> 02:14:19.074
<i>his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born.</i>

02:15:41.865 --> 02:15:43.408
An angel!

02:15:46.202 --> 02:15:47.579
