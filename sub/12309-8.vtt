00:00.226 --> 00:03.127
previously on stargate atlantis...

00:04.280 --> 00:05.945
You have some wraith dna.

00:06.103 --> 00:08.726
My father told people that it was a gift.

00:08.737 --> 00:10.601
Ah, they've picked up my signal.

00:10.654 --> 00:12.255
A subspace tracking device.

00:12.350 --> 00:14.794
I had it implanted.

00:14.795 --> 00:15.995
The hives are firing on each other.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.638
- Are you sure?
- Definitely.

00:17.714 --> 00:20.116
They're not pulling any punches either.

00:21.763 --> 00:25.193
So all it took was the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust me.

00:25.194 --> 00:27.291
Oh, not true, I still don't trust you.

00:27.446 --> 00:30.856
I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect balance--

00:30.857 --> 00:33.090
ability well beyond any normal human,

00:33.091 --> 00:38.198
but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the wraith...

00:43.013 --> 00:45.184
the need to feed.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

00:56.637 --> 00:59.028
I still say we should've brought backup.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.179
Another jumper, or a marine unit, something.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.414
This is intended to be a diplomatic mission, rodney.

01:03.415 --> 01:04.914
What kind of message would that send?

01:04.915 --> 01:06.372
Well, a strong one, hopefully.

01:06.373 --> 01:09.341
Everybody's going to be fine if they don't panic.

01:09.414 --> 01:11.596
Easier said than done.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.022
There they are.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.200
My god, how big is that thing?

01:23.221 --> 01:25.665
Never seen a hive in space, huh?

01:25.738 --> 01:28.413
I've never seen one period.

01:28.906 --> 01:31.371
I mean, I've seen video logs, but never in person.

01:31.372 --> 01:33.522
Well, you never forget your first.

01:33.826 --> 01:35.578
They know we're here.

01:35.662 --> 01:38.001
Apparently. We're receiving a transmission.

01:39.322 --> 01:40.770
Docking instructions.

01:40.771 --> 01:42.836
What, no, "hello. Greetings, weary travelers?"

01:42.899 --> 01:45.821
Guess not. So much for the red carpet.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.140
So, what happens now?

02:01.381 --> 02:05.032
Well, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we get double-crossed and taken prisoner.

02:05.189 --> 02:07.392
That will not happen this time, rodney.

02:07.644 --> 02:08.913
We were invited, remember?

02:09.144 --> 02:10.916
And that makes a difference?

02:13.084 --> 02:14.993
Right on cue.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.798
This looks a little familiar.

lower your weapons.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.513
My apologies.

02:51.586 --> 02:52.803
You understand.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.943
You can't be too careful.

02:56.077 --> 02:58.300
Welcome to my ship.

<font color="#ffff00">The Queen</font>

03:05.281 --> 03:07.358
This is my second-in-command.

03:07.568 --> 03:10.222
I've asked him to be a part of these discussions.

03:10.285 --> 03:12.855
Please, sit.

03:17.577 --> 03:19.223
Fruit bowl, nice touch.

03:19.276 --> 03:21.521
Well, we picked them up on our travels.

03:22.098 --> 03:25.045
I thought it would make our discussions more comfortable.

03:25.454 --> 03:28.727
I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them.

03:31.192 --> 03:33.510
All right, let's just get this over with.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.070
So, I understand you have a proposal,

03:36.311 --> 03:38.262
a breakthrough of some kind?

03:38.430 --> 03:42.741
This is dr.Keller. She's our chief medical officer, and she's going to explain everything to you.

03:42.857 --> 03:45.615
Well, um...

03:46.413 --> 03:48.678
uh, as you may already know,

03:48.699 --> 03:53.052
we recently stumbled across a lab belonging to michael,

03:53.482 --> 03:56.152
- the wraith that we--
- I know who he is.

03:57.361 --> 03:58.567
Of course you do.

03:58.609 --> 04:02.984
Word of your success against him spread rapidly among my kind.

04:04.242 --> 04:05.711
We are very grateful.

04:05.753 --> 04:08.700
Trust me, we didn't do it for you.

04:08.721 --> 04:13.725
Anyway, we recovered a database from his lab that allowed us to continue his research into--

04:13.851 --> 04:15.917
for what purpose?

04:16.483 --> 04:18.802
We've come up with a gene therapy

04:18.923 --> 04:24.913
that alters wraith dna in a small but significant way.

04:25.364 --> 04:32.277
In a nutshell-- we think we can make it so that you, and any other wraith we treat,

04:32.798 --> 04:36.081
will never need to feed on humans again.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.707
This is absurd.

04:40.843 --> 04:45.301
Well, actually, it's not as big of a change as you might think.

04:45.668 --> 04:50.042
Your bodies already contain all the organs necessary to digest food.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.175
Here.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.189
Try this.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.067
If I consume this,

04:58.256 --> 05:00.899
it may give me a moment's pleasure,

05:01.512 --> 05:03.421
but it will not sustain me.

05:03.558 --> 05:07.082
But that can change, at least in theory.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.771
Why would we want this?

05:08.907 --> 05:10.953
Of what benefit is it?

05:10.954 --> 05:12.254
Well, think about it.

05:12.317 --> 05:16.386
If you put yourself on regular food, you could give up all those tiresome cullings.

05:16.460 --> 05:19.691
It would give you a significant advantage over other hives.

05:19.921 --> 05:24.579
Not to mention I could stop waiting for the chance to kill you, in theory.

05:24.736 --> 05:27.841
Our current feeding process gives us strength,

05:28.050 --> 05:31.543
our ability to heal, our longevity.

05:31.637 --> 05:38.812
Well, um, we're not entirely sure how this change would affect your, um... gifts.

05:39.044 --> 05:43.376
They may continue, although possibly in a diminished form.

05:43.428 --> 05:44.352
Possibly?

05:44.498 --> 05:46.890
It's difficult to know from lab tests.

05:47.047 --> 05:54.138
We can't be sure until we administer it to, um, live subjects.

05:54.901 --> 06:00.387
Well, let's not forget that michael spread the modified hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more.

06:00.388 --> 06:02.149
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?

06:02.474 --> 06:05.495
Which means that every time you feed, you're taking a risk.

06:05.579 --> 06:08.810
Bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.873
That's why you wraith are at each other's throats. So...

06:12.922 --> 06:14.632
here's your chance.

06:26.573 --> 06:27.842
This is wrong.

06:28.042 --> 06:29.741
We shouldn't be here.

06:29.909 --> 06:33.045
I don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty well.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.524
Yeah.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.325
You don't seem too happy about it.

06:37.346 --> 06:39.622
I was just expecting a little more resistance.

06:39.926 --> 06:41.573
Well, he hasn't said yes yet.

06:41.594 --> 06:43.755
Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.

06:43.818 --> 06:45.821
And why not? It is a reasonable offer.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.909
Why are we thinking of ways to fix them

06:47.910 --> 06:49.608
when we should be thinking of ways to kill them?

06:49.650 --> 06:52.178
We've been trying to do that for four years.
They're still here.

06:52.241 --> 06:56.741
The wraith may not deserve our consideration, but as john pointed out, we're not doing this for them.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.510
There's something going on here, something he's not telling us.

06:59.573 --> 07:01.451
What a surprise.

07:04.136 --> 07:05.500
I'm sorry.

07:05.835 --> 07:07.273
Am I disturbing you?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.720
Come in.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.797
I have...

07:11.028 --> 07:12.811
considered your offer.

07:14.089 --> 07:15.600
That was fast.

07:15.862 --> 07:18.033
I believe your idea has merit,

07:18.212 --> 07:20.498
if you can make the treatment to work.

07:20.635 --> 07:21.768
It'll work.

07:21.799 --> 07:24.799
Of course, converting a single hive would be pointless.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.593
It would make little difference to the humans of this galaxy and would make us pariahs amongst are own kind.

07:29.594 --> 07:31.670
Wait a minute, I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.

07:31.671 --> 07:34.166
I do, but I may have...

07:34.303 --> 07:37.177
exaggerated my position within the alliance.

07:37.178 --> 07:38.908
He doesn't have the clout.

07:39.012 --> 07:40.827
Then he's no good to us.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.890
There's only one you need to convince.

07:45.348 --> 07:49.491
Among all the queens in the alliance, one sits above the rest.

07:49.890 --> 07:53.016
We call her the primary.

07:53.310 --> 07:54.967
The uber-queen?

07:55.093 --> 07:57.789
Convince her, and the rest will fall into line.

07:57.831 --> 07:59.100
Then convince her.

07:59.121 --> 08:02.110
She will only speak with another queen.

08:02.247 --> 08:05.320
And your queen was killed last year in the skies above atlantis.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.166
Regrettably, yes,

08:07.533 --> 08:10.953
but the primary does not know this.

08:11.656 --> 08:12.831
You...

08:12.841 --> 08:18.159
you bluffed your way into the alliance and convinced them you still have a queen?

08:18.296 --> 08:20.215
They would not have accepted me otherwise.

08:20.394 --> 08:23.593
Up to now, I've been able to maintain this subterfuge,

08:23.799 --> 08:26.956
but a face-to-face meeting,

08:28.288 --> 08:30.711
that would be difficult.

08:33.019 --> 08:34.404
In fact,

08:34.602 --> 08:38.557
there is only one person who could help me.

08:44.782 --> 08:46.062
This is crazy.

08:46.063 --> 08:48.558
Believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.

08:48.674 --> 08:50.803
Do you realize what he's asking you to do?

08:50.834 --> 08:55.727
Well, dr.Keller assures me that the procedure is completely reversible and will have no lasting ill-effects.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.801
I'm not talking about the procedure.

08:59.210 --> 09:00.364
I know.

09:00.825 --> 09:06.185
Look, even if this works, even if all the wraith stop feeding, you think they're going to become nice and friendly overnight?

09:06.186 --> 09:06.762
No.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.825
They're going to have a massive technological advantage.

09:10.140 --> 09:13.434
You're suggesting they will enslave the people of this galaxy rather than feed on them.

09:13.435 --> 09:16.045
We've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.

09:16.046 --> 09:18.112
You didn't voice this objection before.

09:18.206 --> 09:21.322
Nobody was asking you to risk your life.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.885
My wraith dna makes me the only possible candidate.

09:27.028 --> 09:29.839
Anyone else would be detected by the queen immediately.

09:30.133 --> 09:33.091
Well, that's fine, by my question is, why now?

09:33.343 --> 09:36.857
The wraith are busy killing each other.
Why don't we just sit back and watch?

09:37.052 --> 09:39.549
Eventually, one faction will emerge victorious,

09:39.601 --> 09:42.119
and then everything will go back to the way it was.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.035
But maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.

09:45.036 --> 09:47.248
And if todd's alliance is destroyed?

09:47.249 --> 09:50.447
We may never have another opportunity like this again.

09:50.521 --> 09:53.689
I admit, this may not solve the wraith problem once and for all,

09:53.773 --> 09:58.409
but there are people alive today who will be culled in the coming weeks and months,

09:58.410 --> 10:03.056
and if I can save even some of them, I have to try.

10:03.182 --> 10:06.370
If not for myself, then for my son.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.098
Colonel sheppard, come in.

10:10.136 --> 10:11.794
This is sheppard, go ahead.

10:11.993 --> 10:16.377
Mr. Woolsey wanted me to inform you, sir, he's here.

10:21.442 --> 10:23.330
You sure you're ready for this?

10:23.718 --> 10:25.459
As ready as I'll ever be.

10:26.949 --> 10:28.858
I'm sorry. I...

10:29.254 --> 10:32.160
I feel like you're being pressured into this because of my research.

10:32.161 --> 10:34.709
I am not being pressured into anything,

10:34.710 --> 10:39.072
and your research may save thousands, even millions of lives.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.520
Remember that.

10:40.677 --> 10:41.548
Right.

10:52.201 --> 10:53.880
Can I help you?

10:54.645 --> 10:56.282
Just remember,

10:58.043 --> 11:00.225
if anything happens to her,

11:01.462 --> 11:04.620
there won't be anywhere in the galaxy you can hide.

11:06.803 --> 11:08.744
Is that all?

11:12.523 --> 11:13.803
Right.

11:14.663 --> 11:16.257
How is my patient?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.324
She's fine.

11:19.089 --> 11:22.247
Very well, let's get started.

11:22.740 --> 11:24.617
Don't worry, he's just here as a technical advisor.

11:24.670 --> 11:27.114
I'm going to be performing the surgery.

11:28.394 --> 11:30.880
All right, we're ready.

12:26.561 --> 12:27.967
When are we going to get to see her?

12:27.968 --> 12:29.278
Give it some time, just relax.

12:29.279 --> 12:31.481
I can'T. I had, like, three cups of coffee. I'm completely wired.

12:31.482 --> 12:34.145
Really? I hadn't noticed.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.866
All right, you can see her now.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.921
How do I look?

12:58.966 --> 13:02.459
Now, assume your throne.

13:12.007 --> 13:15.280
Are you trying to get us both killed?

13:16.349 --> 13:17.734
I do not understand.

13:17.797 --> 13:22.402
At the first sign of deception, the primary will not hesitate to slit our throats!

13:22.601 --> 13:24.867
You said she would sense my wraith dna.

13:24.868 --> 13:28.182
It is not your dna that concerns me.

13:28.319 --> 13:32.578
It is your manner, your bearing.

13:32.997 --> 13:36.561
You project apprehension.

13:36.562 --> 13:37.956
Well, given the circumstances--

13:37.957 --> 13:41.774
it may be understandable, but it is not acceptable!

13:42.446 --> 13:44.103
Above all,

13:45.414 --> 13:48.666
you must never show weakness.

13:51.225 --> 13:53.953
Now... again!

13:55.075 --> 13:56.921
How long is this going to take, anyway?

13:56.953 --> 14:00.089
Until todd's satisfied she can pass as a wraith queen.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.353
You know, personally, I'm not inclined to rush this thing.

14:02.573 --> 14:04.598
She's already too convincing if you ask me.

14:04.599 --> 14:05.772
Creeps me out.

14:05.793 --> 14:08.993
She's still teyla, underneath all that.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.860
Maybe that's the problem.

14:10.902 --> 14:13.629
Look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys,

14:13.630 --> 14:16.052
but the fact is, todd's putting his life on the line, too.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.671
I don't think he'd go in there with her if he didn't think she could pull this off.

14:23.975 --> 14:24.982
Where's teyla?

14:25.055 --> 14:26.492
Resting.

14:26.576 --> 14:29.639
You'll be pleased to know we've received word back from the primary's hive.

14:29.691 --> 14:31.978
We've been instructed to meet them at their current location.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.677
So, what's the plan?

14:33.751 --> 14:37.412
Once we arrive, we make contact with the ship and make our way over.

14:37.475 --> 14:39.594
Then teyla will put forward my proposal.

14:39.595 --> 14:40.873
Oh, your proposal?

14:40.914 --> 14:45.005
Believe me, the less the primary knows about my dealings with the humans of atlantis, the better.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.372
If she doesn't know it's coming from us, what are the chances she's going to buy it?

14:48.408 --> 14:51.933
Our alliance has recently been dealt a number of setbacks.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.093
You're getting your asses kicked.

14:54.282 --> 14:55.761
Indeed.

14:55.950 --> 14:59.023
Although the primary would never admit it out loud,

14:59.304 --> 15:03.542
but the one thing stronger than her pride

15:04.664 --> 15:09.070
is her instinct for survival.

15:24.177 --> 15:26.223
Don't be nervous.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.583
I am not.

15:40.452 --> 15:41.689
So...

15:42.340 --> 15:45.508
at long last we meet.

15:46.053 --> 15:47.626
Indeed.

15:48.261 --> 15:53.411
Many among my crew were beginning to think you didn't exist.

15:57.366 --> 16:00.166
You must point them out to me,

16:00.167 --> 16:04.907
so that I may remove all doubt from their minds.

16:05.893 --> 16:08.768
That will no longer be necessary.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.883
Make your way to my ship,

16:11.884 --> 16:15.439
and do not keep me waiting again.

16:18.971 --> 16:20.492
She likes you.

16:21.131 --> 16:22.600
You think so?

16:22.904 --> 16:26.208
It was as warm a reception as we could expect.

16:33.315 --> 16:34.500
How'd it go?

16:34.765 --> 16:36.622
Apparently, quite well.

16:36.674 --> 16:39.727
They're preparing a shuttle to take me over to the other hive.

16:40.073 --> 16:42.674
You know we can pull the plug anytime you want, you just give us the word.

16:42.716 --> 16:43.786
No.

16:43.933 --> 16:46.104
We've come this far. I intend to go through with this.

16:46.199 --> 16:47.489
Well, we'll be right here.

16:47.646 --> 16:49.429
If anything goes wrong, we'll get you out.

16:49.482 --> 16:50.457
But nothing's going to.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.881
- Well, no, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does--
- rodney...

16:53.401 --> 16:55.090
which it won'T.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.873
Hey...

16:57.628 --> 16:59.820
just be careful over there.

17:28.609 --> 17:30.339
Welcome to my ship.

17:32.196 --> 17:33.675
Where is your queen?

17:33.780 --> 17:36.235
You will meet her in time.

17:36.633 --> 17:39.004
Inform the bridge they're onboard.

17:39.287 --> 17:41.972
Take us to hyperspace.

17:43.493 --> 17:46.252
This was not part of the agreement.

17:46.431 --> 17:49.431
You did not expect us to conduct this meeting here,

17:49.452 --> 17:52.095
within weapons range of your hive?

17:52.096 --> 17:54.937
We are part of the same alliance.

17:55.021 --> 17:57.958
Unless you do not trust us?

18:00.224 --> 18:02.783
I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know.

18:02.825 --> 18:07.315
It is how the queen wishes it.

18:10.808 --> 18:12.245
Follow me.

18:12.832 --> 18:14.836
Please.

18:31.587 --> 18:32.594
What's going on?

18:32.595 --> 18:35.458
The primary's hive just went into hyperspace.

18:35.521 --> 18:36.234
What?

18:36.235 --> 18:37.430
That wasn't part of the deal.

18:37.431 --> 18:38.699
No, it was not.

18:38.752 --> 18:39.727
Where'd they go?

18:39.728 --> 18:41.017
I do not know.

18:41.175 --> 18:43.566
- There is no way to track them.
- He's lying.

18:45.811 --> 18:47.384
Uh, ronon?

18:47.762 --> 18:51.412
I assure you, I know nothing of this.

18:51.496 --> 18:52.702
Ronon...

18:58.403 --> 19:01.781
it appears we have no choice but to trust each other.

19:10.655 --> 19:12.679
The queen shall see you shortly.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.246
What have you done?

19:19.247 --> 19:21.805
I swear I did not expect this to happen.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.473
We're in no danger.

19:23.515 --> 19:25.718
If the queen did not believe us, we'd be dead already.

19:25.719 --> 19:27.952
And if she begins to suspect?

19:28.025 --> 19:29.326
We are trapped on this ship.

19:29.327 --> 19:32.641
Everything will be fine, provided you continue to play your part.

19:32.642 --> 19:34.581
We must proceed as planned.

19:37.036 --> 19:39.092
What is he doing here?

19:42.239 --> 19:44.410
I thought his presence would be useful,

19:44.411 --> 19:47.022
as he is the one you've been dealing with up until now.

19:47.023 --> 19:49.487
I do not like surprises.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.851
Nor do I,

19:50.935 --> 19:55.781
and yet you are the one who took your ship to hyperspace the moment we stepped aboard.

19:55.884 --> 19:58.003
If you were in my position,

19:58.004 --> 20:01.853
you might understand the need for such precautions.

20:03.961 --> 20:05.377
Very well.

20:09.940 --> 20:10.863
Come.

20:11.105 --> 20:13.066
Let's sit.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.051
What are you doing?

20:31.443 --> 20:33.520
What is the meaning of this?

20:33.813 --> 20:35.114
Forgive me,

20:35.115 --> 20:38.459
but this is the way it must be.

20:44.584 --> 20:46.567
You must say that you killed her.

20:46.714 --> 20:48.035
Are you insane?

20:48.130 --> 20:50.416
This is how it is done with our kind.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.221
This is how power changes hands.

20:52.222 --> 20:53.711
- But I do not want--
- listen to me!

20:53.952 --> 20:57.151
The crew will not be happy, but nor will they wish to be without a queen.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.840
You caught her off-guard.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.368
Many will perceive that to mean that she was growing weak.

21:01.369 --> 21:06.550
All you need to do is convince them that you are a capable replacement, and they will accept you.

21:06.551 --> 21:08.197
And if I can't?

21:08.648 --> 21:10.389
Then we're both dead.

21:10.473 --> 21:12.497
What is this?

21:13.181 --> 21:15.940
I have taken what is rightfully mine.

21:19.685 --> 21:21.185
You killed her!

21:21.311 --> 21:22.255
Yes,

21:22.318 --> 21:24.279
and you are the better for it.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.758
You will die for this.

21:25.811 --> 21:29.136
How dare you point a weapon at your queen!

21:29.408 --> 21:30.929
This was my queen!

21:30.961 --> 21:32.178
Not anymore.

21:32.262 --> 21:33.982
She was growing weak.

21:34.129 --> 21:37.213
She no longer had full control over the alliance.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.311
If you can't see that, you're a fool.

21:43.797 --> 21:45.895
Did I ask you to speak for me?

21:45.896 --> 21:47.293
No, my queen.

21:47.294 --> 21:50.733
Wag your tongue like that again, and I will remove it.

21:50.870 --> 21:51.866
Is that understood?

21:51.939 --> 21:53.691
Yes, my queen!

21:55.904 --> 21:58.432
Now, drop us out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic.

21:58.495 --> 22:01.191
I wish to know the state of my new flagship.

22:02.450 --> 22:06.908
And have this... thing removed from my sight.

22:09.232 --> 22:11.424
Yes, my queen.

22:22.142 --> 22:23.610
I have surveyed the crew.

22:23.611 --> 22:25.729
You'll be pleased to know they were entirely fooled.

22:25.730 --> 22:26.694
What were you thinking?

22:26.695 --> 22:28.383
You put both our lives at terrible risk.

22:28.446 --> 22:29.547
I know.

22:29.684 --> 22:32.023
- If you'll allow me to explain--
- how could you do this?

22:32.024 --> 22:35.311
It was necessary. The former queen was never going to accept your proposal.

22:35.363 --> 22:38.028
And so you killed her and forced me to take the blame?

22:38.029 --> 22:40.461
If I had taken the blame, I would have been killed, and you would have been held captive.

22:40.462 --> 22:42.350
That was not the desired outcome.

22:42.454 --> 22:46.600
You must understand, our culture is different from your own.

22:46.663 --> 22:50.397
We govern ourselves by different rules.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.711
It was important for you to claim ownership of the act of killing the queen.

22:54.785 --> 22:59.348
You should have informed me of your intention to make me queen of this hive.

22:59.442 --> 23:01.225
Perhaps,

23:01.550 --> 23:05.106
but I doubt you would have gone through with it had you known.

23:05.107 --> 23:08.505
You're right. It was a foolish, reckless plan.

23:08.704 --> 23:10.834
Most wraith seek to be ruled.

23:10.886 --> 23:13.036
They fear being without a queen.

23:13.215 --> 23:18.795
I knew that if you presented yourself as a viable substitute, most of them would just fall in line.

23:19.134 --> 23:21.022
Most of them?

23:21.389 --> 23:26.046
The point is, we have achieved what we set out to do.

23:26.692 --> 23:29.346
You are now effectively in control of the alliance.

23:29.347 --> 23:33.573
We may now implement dr. Keller's plan without hindrance.

23:33.687 --> 23:37.642
Then there is no further need for us to continue this charade.

23:38.061 --> 23:39.781
Take me back to your ship.

23:40.149 --> 23:42.142
Soon, but first,

23:42.194 --> 23:46.142
you must allow some time for order to be restored,

23:46.195 --> 23:47.957
for things to return to normal.

23:48.215 --> 23:51.236
Once they do, you may take your leave,

23:51.635 --> 23:54.698
and no one on this crew will be the wiser.

23:59.535 --> 24:01.245
I still say this was a setup.

24:01.371 --> 24:04.465
I don't know, kenny seemed pretty surprised when that ship disappeared.

24:04.466 --> 24:05.221
Who?

24:05.482 --> 24:07.150
Kenny, the second-in-command.

24:07.151 --> 24:08.860
Well, since when did we start calling him that?

24:08.861 --> 24:09.971
Maybe he wasn't in on it.

24:09.982 --> 24:13.569
I don't know, if todd wanted to kidnap teyla, he would've done it the second we arrived.

24:13.653 --> 24:14.576
It doesn't add up.

24:14.577 --> 24:17.335
Seriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we should take a vote.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.485
So, what are we going to do?

24:19.529 --> 24:22.046
We can't stay here. We're stuck on a hive surrounded by wraith.

24:22.047 --> 24:23.557
Not exactly our strongest position.

24:23.558 --> 24:25.718
All I've got is a jumper. Where do you want to go?

24:25.801 --> 24:27.878
Well, we get to a gate, we gate back to atlantis,

24:27.879 --> 24:29.735
and then we figure out where they took teyla.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.151
How, exactly?

24:31.224 --> 24:34.990
Okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet, but...

24:36.594 --> 24:38.157
we have something.

24:39.490 --> 24:42.269
The primary's hive has dropped out of hyperspace.

24:42.270 --> 24:43.067
How do you know?

24:43.068 --> 24:45.028
We're receiving a signal.

24:48.909 --> 24:50.587
It's todd's subspace transmitter.

24:50.734 --> 24:53.105
They're in empty space, on the edge of a large nebula.

24:53.106 --> 24:54.406
What are they doing out there?

24:54.490 --> 24:56.525
Who cares? This is our chance. Let's go after them.

24:56.567 --> 24:58.434
I've already plotted the course,

24:58.435 --> 25:01.948
but you should know that it will arouse suspicion for us to arrive unannounced.

25:01.949 --> 25:04.035
Well, let's worry about that later.

25:04.119 --> 25:07.727
For now, this is the closest thing they've got to a distress signal.

25:18.325 --> 25:20.538
I'm sorry to disturb you, my queen.

25:20.758 --> 25:22.846
We've received an urgent report.

25:22.847 --> 25:25.499
You intend to make her read it?

25:26.896 --> 25:32.424
A hive belonging to another alliance has been detected above one of our feeding grounds not far from here.

25:32.425 --> 25:34.647
Have you tried to contact them?

25:34.815 --> 25:36.357
They are not responding.

25:36.441 --> 25:38.654
Dispatch the closest hive to investigate.

25:38.749 --> 25:40.689
We are the closest hive.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.590
It falls upon us to intercept.

25:42.591 --> 25:45.359
We must remain here.

25:48.842 --> 25:50.206
My queen,

25:50.584 --> 25:53.846
perhaps we should discuss this in private.

25:58.647 --> 26:00.220
Leave us.

26:15.409 --> 26:17.077
We must respond to this.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.025
To do otherwise will read as weakness.

26:20.026 --> 26:21.189
The crew will not understand.

26:21.241 --> 26:22.920
Then let them be confused.

26:22.941 --> 26:25.511
Spoken like a true queen,

26:25.689 --> 26:28.395
but you risk breeding suspicion.

26:29.496 --> 26:32.916
For the moment, they believe you, and are prepared to serve you

26:32.917 --> 26:36.776
but if you break that trust by making irrational decisions,

26:36.777 --> 26:39.734
they will quickly fall away from you.

26:39.975 --> 26:41.811
What about your ship?

26:41.812 --> 26:44.045
It is probably already on its way.

26:44.046 --> 26:47.664
They will pick up on our new location as soon as they arrive.

26:49.143 --> 26:51.776
Inform the bridge to set a course.

26:53.580 --> 26:56.276
Now, kenny's right about one thing--

26:56.570 --> 27:00.608
the second we drop out of hyperspace, the primary's hive ship's going to know something's up.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.514
We drop out early, go the rest of the way by jumper.

27:03.797 --> 27:06.755
That's going to take too long. We need a diversion.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.073
So, what... what kind of a diversion?

27:09.314 --> 27:10.919
You thinking what I'm thinking?

27:11.003 --> 27:14.769
Yeah, but I don't think we can rely on kenny to give the order, though.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.447
We don't give him a choice.

27:16.531 --> 27:18.723
What are you talking about? What order?

27:19.028 --> 27:21.713
Oh, no, wait a minute. You're not thinking about attacking the other ship?

27:21.786 --> 27:25.699
Look, it's the only way to keep them occupied long enough to get on board, get teyla, and get back.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.534
But it's also incredibly risky. I mean, either of the ships could be destroyed.

27:28.597 --> 27:31.534
Well, we'll just make sure we get her out of there before that happens.

27:33.798 --> 27:37.470
Look, I realize the odds aren't exactly in our favor, rodney,

27:37.564 --> 27:40.522
but the longer we wait to get teyla, the more likely it is we never will.

27:41.131 --> 27:44.466
We just have to keep all of our options open.

27:54.691 --> 27:56.527
We have reached the feeding ground.

27:57.953 --> 28:00.565
They will attempt to negotiate a concession,

28:00.731 --> 28:02.766
but you must stand firm.

28:02.965 --> 28:05.787
They may even threaten to attack,

28:05.788 --> 28:09.626
but they will not want to fight any more than we do.

28:12.763 --> 28:15.165
The other hive is trying to contact us.

28:15.186 --> 28:17.861
Ignore them. Charge weapons.

28:18.354 --> 28:20.850
You wish to attack unprovoked?

28:21.175 --> 28:22.937
We were provoked.

28:23.116 --> 28:25.319
They have encroached upon our territory.

28:26.651 --> 28:28.298
I want them destroyed.

28:28.990 --> 28:30.228
Now!

28:46.292 --> 28:47.487
What are you doing?

28:47.652 --> 28:48.585
What does it look like?

28:48.586 --> 28:50.410
I told you to talk to them.

28:50.411 --> 28:53.473
You also told me to show no weakness.

28:54.459 --> 28:55.907
They're returning fire.

28:56.148 --> 28:57.837
We're taking hull damage.

28:57.921 --> 28:59.274
Deploy the darts.

28:59.275 --> 29:02.117
Under these conditions, they will suffer heavy losses.

29:02.180 --> 29:05.222
I'm fully aware of the costs,

29:05.306 --> 29:08.956
but we must take a firm stance against intrusions such as this.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.393
You're doing this on purpose,

29:14.001 --> 29:16.089
to kill wraith.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.953
Half the first wave has been destroyed.

29:36.498 --> 29:41.418
But the survivors are now too close to be affected by the ship's weapons, and they can attack at will.

29:42.803 --> 29:45.572
Until the enemy launches their own darts to intercept.

29:45.647 --> 29:47.545
That will take time.

29:47.975 --> 29:50.713
With any luck, we've caught them off guard.

30:00.235 --> 30:01.357
They're not here.

30:01.358 --> 30:03.161
Where the hell are they?

30:03.255 --> 30:04.598
They've moved,

30:04.693 --> 30:06.822
to one of our more populated feeding grounds.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.776
What for?

30:07.839 --> 30:09.245
I do not know.

30:09.318 --> 30:11.343
I'm not on the ship.

30:11.542 --> 30:14.332
But if I had to guess, I would say they've gone to cull.

30:14.825 --> 30:15.738
What now?

30:15.790 --> 30:17.909
What else can we do? We go after them.

30:18.119 --> 30:20.637
If they jump into hyperspace, we're going to lose them again, right?

30:20.658 --> 30:23.186
Pretty much. Todd's locator beacon doesn't work in hyperspace.

30:23.269 --> 30:24.665
We got to stop playing catch-up.

30:24.666 --> 30:26.364
Is there a stargate on that planet?

30:26.479 --> 30:27.497
Of course.

30:27.623 --> 30:30.151
Then drop us off. We can get there faster in the jumper.

30:31.293 --> 30:32.835
How do you intend to get on board their ship?

30:32.898 --> 30:35.657
Don't worry about it. Just get us to the nearest stargate.

30:51.468 --> 30:52.549
My queen,

30:52.721 --> 30:55.134
our darts are outnumbered two to one.

30:55.197 --> 30:58.333
If we do not recall them now, they will be wiped out.

30:58.459 --> 31:02.770
And their sacrifice will be remembered when this alliance rules the galaxy.

31:03.893 --> 31:06.232
What was that?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.823
We just lost the medial weapons array.

31:10.841 --> 31:13.600
Keep firing all other batteries.

31:18.908 --> 31:21.981
All right, we should be coming up on them now.

31:22.335 --> 31:24.475
Wait a minute, there's two of them.

31:24.622 --> 31:25.398
What?

31:25.399 --> 31:26.804
And they're fighting.

31:26.805 --> 31:28.136
They're not pulling any punches, either.

31:28.377 --> 31:29.835
Still picking up that signal?

31:29.982 --> 31:31.157
Yeah.

31:33.381 --> 31:35.017
All right, it's that one.

31:35.604 --> 31:37.052
They're not doing so good.

31:37.104 --> 31:37.828
What do you mean?

31:37.829 --> 31:39.518
They must've lost some of their weapons.

31:39.519 --> 31:40.787
I mean, they're seriously outgunned.

31:40.829 --> 31:41.878
We got to do something.

31:41.993 --> 31:46.462
You know, just last week I was talking to zelenka about trying to reverse-engineer a daedalus beaming system for the jumpers.

31:46.474 --> 31:47.261
And?

31:47.397 --> 31:49.002
Oh, well, no, we're nowhere near close.

31:49.086 --> 31:51.383
I mean, the asgard technology's incredibly complicated--

31:51.384 --> 31:53.075
what the hell are you bringing this up for now?

31:53.190 --> 31:55.697
I'm just saying that this would be the perfect situation for something like...

31:55.771 --> 31:58.529
All right, everybody hold on. We're going in.

31:58.624 --> 31:59.662
What are you doing?

31:59.725 --> 32:02.096
Trying to tip the scales a little.

32:05.893 --> 32:08.368
Are you nuts? They can see us!

32:19.078 --> 32:20.452
Think that did it?

32:20.494 --> 32:22.875
We're about to find out.

32:35.140 --> 32:37.060
That's impossible.

32:37.459 --> 32:39.945
The enemy hive just exploded.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.924
Well done, my queen.

32:44.455 --> 32:47.759
Perhaps next time, you will not be so quick to question my tactics.

32:56.459 --> 32:59.145
Recall the darts.

33:01.618 --> 33:03.841
Darts are heading back. Bay doors are open.

33:03.967 --> 33:06.694
All right, that's our cue. I'm going in.

33:14.046 --> 33:14.875
Where do we go?

33:14.876 --> 33:15.987
I don't know.

33:16.144 --> 33:18.011
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- It's hard to tell.

33:18.012 --> 33:19.742
I think we're on the wrong level.

33:19.743 --> 33:21.095
Plus, the signal keeps moving around.

33:21.096 --> 33:23.172
That's a good sign todd's alive.

33:23.340 --> 33:24.986
Still doesn't tell us anything about teyla.

33:24.987 --> 33:26.298
All right.

33:26.654 --> 33:28.805
Tit'shis way. I think.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.535
We're going to have to circle back.

33:44.536 --> 33:46.591
Oh, great, I got to figure this out all over again?

33:48.595 --> 33:51.312
- Another patrol coming this way.
- So, what are we going to do?

33:51.432 --> 33:52.984
We got no choice.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.808
- Let's move.
- Which way?

34:11.322 --> 34:13.525
I guess that answers that.

34:38.058 --> 34:39.568
Inform the queen.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.509
We have intruders.

34:52.774 --> 34:54.232
Now what?

34:54.431 --> 34:55.942
Well, if i had to guess,

34:55.943 --> 34:59.582
I'd say we'll be taken in front of the queen, who will demand answers and threaten to feed on us.

34:59.624 --> 35:03.557
At which time, I hope to have plan to get us out of here.

35:03.798 --> 35:05.214
Very reassuring.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.159
it's teyla. She's alive.

35:12.442 --> 35:14.089
Rodney, quiet.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.302
Leave us.

35:24.534 --> 35:28.981
John, ronon, rodney, it is good to see you,

35:29.034 --> 35:30.576
but you should not have come for me.

35:30.639 --> 35:32.034
Why? What's going on?

35:32.035 --> 35:33.754
I'll explain later,

35:33.922 --> 35:36.020
but you must not attempt to escape.

35:36.072 --> 35:38.034
You're in no danger.

35:38.076 --> 35:40.195
I'm now queen of this hive.

35:40.811 --> 35:42.249
Wait, what?

35:42.836 --> 35:44.546
It is a long story.

35:45.301 --> 35:46.948
No, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now.

35:46.949 --> 35:49.644
No, I must solidify my position first.

35:49.728 --> 35:53.577
It is the only chance we have to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment.

35:53.672 --> 35:56.923
Otherwise, this will all have been for nothing.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.559
All right.

36:01.895 --> 36:05.000
We'll let it play out. For now.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.884
My queen...

36:28.105 --> 36:29.490
what are you doing here?

36:29.500 --> 36:31.514
Who authorized you to wait in my quarters?

36:31.515 --> 36:33.591
I let myself in.

36:33.601 --> 36:35.406
I needed to see you in private.

36:35.597 --> 36:37.359
I do not wish to speak right now. Come back later.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.405
I'm afraid I can't do that.

36:39.415 --> 36:42.174
- I am your queen. I command you--
- you are not my queen.

36:42.263 --> 36:44.528
How dare you speak to me like this.

36:44.675 --> 36:46.626
Remove yourself from my sight immediately.

36:46.627 --> 36:49.794
I saw you talking with the prisoners from atlantis.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.147
And?

36:51.242 --> 36:53.644
I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?

36:54.049 --> 36:55.265
Oh, you may,

36:55.402 --> 36:58.507
though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.097
I overheard what you said to them.

37:01.412 --> 37:04.475
You knew them, and they knew you,

37:04.863 --> 37:06.982
and I asked myself

37:07.549 --> 37:09.940
"how is such a thing possible?"

37:10.936 --> 37:15.751
I suspected you right from the moment you set foot upon my ship,

37:15.856 --> 37:18.153
and against my better judgment

37:18.195 --> 37:20.880
I allowed you to remain onboard

37:21.004 --> 37:24.277
while you committed treachery after treachery.

37:24.581 --> 37:28.819
It was my duty to defend the ship, and I failed.

37:48.197 --> 37:52.036
I'm afraid your reign is over, my queen.

38:06.514 --> 38:09.608
He'll not be bothering you any further.

38:10.909 --> 38:12.629
Thank you.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.762
My hive arrived moments ago.

38:16.763 --> 38:20.780
I've arranged for colonel sheppard, ronon, and dr. Mckay to be transferred there immediately.

38:20.856 --> 38:22.429
Good. When do I join them?

38:22.430 --> 38:24.265
As soon as this is all over.

38:24.695 --> 38:28.607
...And thus, I will be taking my leave of you, and returning to my former hive.

38:29.121 --> 38:31.786
I am leaving behind my trusted commander.

38:32.384 --> 38:33.968
Let me be clear,

38:33.969 --> 38:36.642
you will still fall under my protection,

38:36.768 --> 38:41.132
but in my absence, you will heed his every order as if it were my own.

38:41.216 --> 38:44.174
When he speaks, it is as though I am speaking through him.

38:44.175 --> 38:45.475
Is that understood?

38:45.611 --> 38:46.838
Yes, my queen.

38:47.751 --> 38:48.674
Good.

38:48.905 --> 38:50.636
Then it is time.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.289
Escort me to my transport.

38:55.419 --> 38:57.726
The queen departs.

39:07.771 --> 39:09.135
Well done.

39:09.136 --> 39:11.621
I believe you've managed to allay all suspicions.

39:11.622 --> 39:13.635
Just remember why we did this,

39:13.636 --> 39:17.056
to disseminate dr. Keller's treatment to as many wraith as possible.

39:17.057 --> 39:18.073
Of course.

39:18.262 --> 39:21.765
Although I think it might be wise to let matters settle for a time first.

39:21.807 --> 39:23.874
How much time?

39:23.989 --> 39:25.332
Not long.

39:25.982 --> 39:28.363
You're not planning on going back on our agreement, are you?

39:28.364 --> 39:29.360
No, no.

39:29.361 --> 39:34.342
I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda so soon after the change in leadership...

39:34.655 --> 39:39.690
well, it may invite unwelcome questions.

39:41.211 --> 39:42.082
Fine.

39:42.083 --> 39:42.827
Very well--

39:42.828 --> 39:46.016
but bear in mind that as far as this crew is concerned,

39:46.173 --> 39:48.481
I am still their queen.

39:48.482 --> 39:49.551
Oh, yes.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.995
I will be watching you,

39:51.996 --> 39:56.750
and should you step out of line, I will not hesitate to make a reappearance

39:56.844 --> 39:58.376
and have you removed.

39:59.047 --> 40:00.222
Very well.

40:00.379 --> 40:02.131
Permanently.

40:23.957 --> 40:25.741
What have you done to her, doc?

40:26.328 --> 40:27.671
Very funny.

40:29.150 --> 40:30.367
How you feeling?

40:30.597 --> 40:31.762
Better.

40:31.961 --> 40:35.076
Still some soreness, but for the most part, it's gone.

40:35.118 --> 40:36.188
Good.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.094
Well, I have rounds, but I'll come and check on you later.

40:40.555 --> 40:43.398
Make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.

40:45.769 --> 40:47.069
Sure you're feeling okay?

40:47.174 --> 40:48.853
Yes. Thank you.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.936
No lingering desires to feed on anything?

40:52.209 --> 40:53.845
Only on solid food.

40:54.170 --> 40:57.758
The blended concoctions given to me by dr. Keller are not very satisfying.

40:57.799 --> 41:00.936
Well, it's only been two weeks.
Give it some time.

41:03.033 --> 41:04.784
Look, um...

41:06.043 --> 41:09.924
I haven't had the chance to tell you that what you did, uh, took...

41:10.333 --> 41:12.001
you know, a lot of guts.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.749
I'm just glad it worked out for the best.

41:16.228 --> 41:18.190
Has there been any further word from todd?

41:18.191 --> 41:21.588
Not really. We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks about this whole gene therapy thing.

41:22.032 --> 41:26.501
Word has it he's solidified his position as, uh, "leader" of the alliance.

41:30.287 --> 41:31.515
What?

41:32.322 --> 41:38.291
Do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this, todd now personally has control of that entire alliance?

41:38.292 --> 41:41.091
You think that was his plan all along, huh?

41:41.270 --> 41:42.812
The thought had crossed my mind.

41:42.885 --> 41:43.871
Yeah.

41:44.091 --> 41:47.511
Regardless, I think we're better off than we were before.

41:48.193 --> 41:49.514
Yes.

41:50.018 --> 41:51.749
I suppose you're right.

41:54.151 --> 41:55.556
Get some rest.

41:55.619 --> 41:57.560
I'll come back and check on you.
