15:19.752 --> 15:25.791
Say hello to Sid the Sleeve.
"Hello, Sky."

15:25.858 --> 15:28.727
Hi, Sid.
"What do you call a man
who wears paper trousers?"

15:29.662 --> 15:32.364
I don't know, Sid. "Russell!"

15:32.431 --> 15:35.234
Yeah? Did you get it? No?

15:35.301 --> 15:36.769
Too advanced, obviously.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.872
No, no, no.
Don't cry, don't cry.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.041
(CRYING)

15:42.107 --> 15:45.044
SARAH JANE: Please, I just
want you to tell me
exactly what you saw.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.513
You saw an iron man.
Like a robot?

15:47.579 --> 15:50.783
Did I say he was a robot? No.

15:50.849 --> 15:54.420
I know what
a robot looks like.
I've seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

15:54.486 --> 15:58.724
This was a bloke.
His skin was all metal.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.393
-Well, what happened?
-Fell out of the sky.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.763
And then stood up
without a scratch on him.

16:04.830 --> 16:08.567
-And turned himself invisible.
-Invisible?

16:08.634 --> 16:11.437
That's right.
And I'm telling you this,

16:11.503 --> 16:15.441
he was armed to his
flaming big steel choppers.

16:15.507 --> 16:20.746
If there's any more
of them on the way,
we don't stand a chance.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.384
A metal man?
Is that even possible?

16:25.451 --> 16:30.089
A bio-metalloid life-form.
Why not? It's a big universe.

16:30.155 --> 16:34.226
But now it's here
and it's got to
be looking for Sky.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.928
Oh, Clyde's not answering.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.664
Well,
whatever it is, we've got to
find it before it finds Sky.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.332
Uh, it's invisible.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.035
Yeah, well, nothing's ever
completely invisible.

16:43.102 --> 16:48.040
Oh, there you are.
What have I missed?

16:48.107 --> 16:50.676
Celeste, do you have
equipment on your van

16:50.743 --> 16:54.613
that can track
an ultra-high frequency
electromagnetic signal?

16:57.249 --> 16:59.585
(HEAVY BREATHING)

17:09.795 --> 17:12.564
Okay, no computers out here,

17:12.631 --> 17:15.768
no alien tech, no phones.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.404
You're safe.

17:18.470 --> 17:22.340
Oh, you like leaves? Leaves
are good. Leaves are green.
But not salad.

17:22.407 --> 17:26.444
Well, salad's green,
but it's also kind of yuck.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.648
CALEB: Hello, Mr Chandra.
We're from West London Power.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.085
This wouldn't be about
all the bulbs blowing,
would it?

17:33.152 --> 17:34.887
There was a freak power surge
in Bannerman Road.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.022
We're visiting every house
looking for the cause.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.857
It needs to be isolated.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.501
Whatever crashed here
emitted UHF
electromagnetic radiation.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.603
That's what
scrambled the radio.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.306
And whatever made those
footprints might be able to
make itself invisible,

17:54.373 --> 17:57.643
-but it can't hide
that energy trace.
-There's something here.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.546
A regular UHF-ME pulse.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.481
And it's moving.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.751
Right towards Bannerman Road.
Rani, try Clyde again.
Warn him!

18:05.818 --> 18:08.587
-He has to get
Sky away from there!
-Who's Sky?

18:08.654 --> 18:10.689
A defenceless child
and there's
something very dangerous

18:10.756 --> 18:12.491
-coming after her.
-He's still not answering.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.426
Come on!

18:14.493 --> 18:16.929
-Thank you, Celeste.
-Oh, my pleasure.
Oh, and be careful.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.131
Oh, never careful,
always prepared!

18:24.102 --> 18:25.938
Zap! Zap, zap!

18:30.342 --> 18:33.145
Every light in the house went
and I don't
suppose West London Power

18:33.212 --> 18:35.647
are going to
reimburse me for those,
are they?

18:35.714 --> 18:37.382
I'm afraid not.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.651
Mrs Chandra,
do you have young children?

18:39.718 --> 18:44.122
No. Just our daughter, Rani.
She's 17, and very clever.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.024
She's going to
be a journalist.

18:46.091 --> 18:48.827
What do children have to do
with your company
blowing our lights?

18:48.894 --> 18:53.532
And you're going to
blow a blood vessel, Haresh,
if you don't calm down.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.235
Would you like a cuppa,
my darlings?

18:56.301 --> 19:00.506
Now,
our neighbour over the road,
she's just fostered a baby.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.342
Earl Grey?

19:05.777 --> 19:08.046
(HEAVY BREATHING)

19:16.989 --> 19:19.424
And that's a tree and... Oh!

19:21.326 --> 19:25.230
And this is grass.
Cows eat grass.
And they go "moo".

19:25.297 --> 19:29.001
And they make milk.
You like milk, don't you?

19:29.067 --> 19:30.569
They also make steak.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.210
Yeah, I like steak.
Especially with chips.

19:38.277 --> 19:41.246
But they have to
come from the chippie,
definitely not from the oven.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.749
Oven chips are the work
of bad cooking goblins.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.419
(CREAKING)

19:52.190 --> 19:54.860
Did you hear something?
It was more like

19:55.894 --> 19:57.496
feel something.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.869
Oh, uh, what made those?

20:09.474 --> 20:10.742
(CLANGING)

20:12.110 --> 20:14.680
Oh, this is not good.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.648
Not good at all.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.586
Not getting any better! Uh-oh!

20:21.853 --> 20:22.955
Hi.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.663
MYERS: Get in,
if you want the child to live!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.831
Who are you?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.867
I'm her mother! Drive!

20:37.336 --> 20:38.937
(TYRES SCREECHING)

20:43.175 --> 20:45.477
-Did you hear that?
-Don't worry.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.146
After the lights exploding
and all the car
alarms going off,

20:48.213 --> 20:50.983
it'll probably be
the gas mains blowing up.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.852
Just a regular day
on Bannerman Road.

20:57.155 --> 21:00.592
I don't know about you, Sky,
but my mum always told me

21:00.659 --> 21:02.394
never to take
lifts off strangers.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.066
Clyde? Clyde?

21:08.900 --> 21:11.136
-He's not here.
-Clyde!

21:14.873 --> 21:16.475
Mr Smith! I need you now!

21:19.544 --> 21:21.546
MR SMITH: <i>Sarah Jane.</i>
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

21:21.613 --> 21:23.248
I need you to find Clyde.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.318
Connect with every CCTV camera
in London, every speed camera,

21:26.385 --> 21:28.553
whatever it takes,
just find him!

21:28.620 --> 21:34.593
<i>There are 521,321 CCTV cameras</i>
<i>in operation across London,</i>
<i>Sarah Jane.</i>

21:34.660 --> 21:36.662
<i>-It may take some time.</i>
-Just do it!

21:36.728 --> 21:38.797
Maybe he's just
taken Sky for a walk.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.233
<i>He is at</i>
<i>the Summerwell</i>
<i>Nuclear Power Station.</i>

21:41.299 --> 21:43.802
-RANI:
Well, that didn't take long.
<i>-I was lucky,</i>

21:43.869 --> 21:47.639
<i>it was only</i>
<i>the 10,052nd camera</i>
<i>I checked.</i>

21:47.706 --> 21:50.108
Who is that woman?

21:50.175 --> 21:53.412
-My name is Miss Myers.
-That doesn't sound like much

21:53.478 --> 21:55.947
-of an alien name.
-We don't spell
it the same way.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.484
-Now, give me the child.
-No, no, no. Answers first!

21:59.551 --> 22:02.988
What was that thing back there
and why is it after the baby?

22:04.856 --> 22:06.825
And what are we doing here?

22:09.194 --> 22:10.829
Come on!

22:13.665 --> 22:18.437
My child has a destiny,
a destiny to change worlds

22:18.503 --> 22:20.872
and that some
will do anything to destroy.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.809
-Oh, what,
like tin man back there?
-Mmm-hmm, the Metalkind.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.745
The enemies of my species,
of all flesh.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.548
But I don't get it.
She's just a baby.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.116
How could you even
begin to understand?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.318
You might be flesh
but you are Earth flesh,

22:33.385 --> 22:37.222
just a few evolutionary
twists from protozoa.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.624
-Now, give me my child!
-I don't think so.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.862
Get him!

22:49.101 --> 22:50.769
(PANTING)

23:08.854 --> 23:10.789
Shh.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.570
Typical. I'm in the middle
of a nuclear power station

23:25.637 --> 23:27.539
and I'm carrying
baby Bang Bang!

23:27.606 --> 23:29.407
MYERS: Find the boy!

23:33.278 --> 23:35.947
SARAH JANE:
Looks like a back door to me.

23:36.014 --> 23:39.451
Why would that woman take
Clyde and Sky to
a nuclear power station?

23:39.518 --> 23:42.921
I don't know, but you've seen
the effect she has on
anything electrical.

23:42.988 --> 23:44.689
Imagine what
could happen there.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.058
Come on,
we may not have much time!

23:50.695 --> 23:52.464
(FOOTSTEPS CLANKING)

24:03.141 --> 24:06.144
Oh, how perfect.

24:06.211 --> 24:09.281
You see, a baby will
always find her mother.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.283
-Give her to me.
-No!

24:11.349 --> 24:14.119
-What are you
going to do to her?
-Take her home, of course.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.722
She is the saviour of my kind.
She will be
the stuff of legend.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.559
-Now, give her to me!
-Clyde! Clyde, run!

24:20.625 --> 24:22.093
MYERS: No!

24:23.495 --> 24:25.430
RANI: (SCREAMS) Oh, boy!

24:29.067 --> 24:31.803
The flesh-whelp
must be destroyed!

24:31.870 --> 24:33.939
-No!
-Get back!

24:34.005 --> 24:36.007
I won't let you
hurt this child!

24:38.109 --> 24:40.912
She is no child.
She is a weapon.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.682
And she is underprimed.
She isn't ready for this.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.550
You have doomed us all!

24:45.617 --> 24:47.586
(SCREAMING)

24:49.287 --> 24:51.189
What's going on?

24:51.256 --> 24:54.226
Sky's energy,
it's flooding out of her!

24:54.292 --> 24:56.461
Yes,
the weapon is priming itself!

24:57.629 --> 25:00.131
Your presence
has activated it.

25:00.198 --> 25:02.934
The doom of
the Metalkind is come!

25:18.216 --> 25:19.417
Sky?

25:26.791 --> 25:28.660
METALKIND: <i>I am too late.</i>

25:28.727 --> 25:31.863
-What am I?
-How did she
transform into a teenager?

25:31.930 --> 25:34.432
MR SMITH: <i>Sky's synthetic DNA</i>
<i>was programmed for this level</i>

25:34.499 --> 25:37.269

You're bringing
your war to Earth!
