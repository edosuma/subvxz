- Narrator on TV: ...mean
the death of our universe

01:01.380 --> 01:03.546
of change and time.

01:03.546 --> 01:07.546
It is at least
one possible future
of the universe,

01:07.546 --> 01:09.130
a future
that can be represented

01:09.130 --> 01:11.713
by a pretty girl
visiting a sunny beach.

01:11.713 --> 01:13.588
( buzzing continues )

01:16.755 --> 01:18.880
Narrator on TV:
Although she does not
yet feel it,

01:18.880 --> 01:21.047
she is subject,
like all things,

01:21.047 --> 01:22.671
to the law
that makes energy

01:22.671 --> 01:25.713
tend to spread out
uniformly.

01:25.713 --> 01:28.963
At the moment,
she's comfortable and warm.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.047
Warm, thanks to
the rays of the sun,

01:31.047 --> 01:33.546
which are soaked up
by her skin.

01:33.546 --> 01:36.339
Warm, thanks to the food
she has eaten.

01:36.339 --> 01:38.421
Food the sun made grow.

01:38.421 --> 01:41.922
Food which her body
has converted into heat energy.

01:43.047 --> 01:44.755
But warm as she is,

01:44.755 --> 01:46.421
when the sun goes,

01:46.421 --> 01:49.005
the girl will lose heat.

01:49.005 --> 01:50.838
That is because
heat always--

01:50.838 --> 01:54.130
( tone blaring )

01:56.588 --> 01:58.089
Man on TV:
We interrupt
this program

01:58.089 --> 02:00.214
for a local
emergency alert.

02:00.214 --> 02:02.546
Important news
will follow.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.588
I'm Don Gordon
with "BTV News."

02:06.588 --> 02:07.963
The National
Weather Service

02:07.963 --> 02:10.797
has issued a severe
flash flood warning.

02:12.172 --> 02:15.421
( tone blaring )

02:15.421 --> 02:18.671
Don:
Local authorities
are now fully mobilized.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.005
This is not a test.

02:22.755 --> 02:25.463
( tone blaring )

02:42.130 --> 02:44.089
( gulps, slurps )

02:51.463 --> 02:52.963

03:10.255 --> 03:12.214
( knocking on door )

03:12.214 --> 03:14.005
Woman:
Housekeeping.

03:19.588 --> 03:20.797
No, thank you.

03:47.047 --> 03:48.380

( sighs )

05:51.214 --> 05:53.172
- ( TV turns on )
- Man on TV: ...further report
from Greg Kendall

05:53.172 --> 05:56.297
of WISH-TV
from the jetliner crash.

05:56.297 --> 06:00.130
Greg: The crash scene
is a mass of debris and
parts of bodies.

06:00.130 --> 06:01.797
The jetliner nosed
into the ground

06:01.797 --> 06:04.546
after it was hit
by a small private plane.

06:04.546 --> 06:06.963
The commercial jetliner
carried a crew of four

06:06.963 --> 06:08.463
and 78 passengers.

06:08.463 --> 06:10.005
No one survived.

06:10.005 --> 06:12.172
Authorities have now started
the massive task

06:12.172 --> 06:14.588
- of finding bodies
and pieces of the plane...
- ( jet engine starts )

06:14.588 --> 06:16.797
...in an attempt
to determine what happened.

06:16.797 --> 06:18.922
The jetliner disintegrated
on impact.

06:18.922 --> 06:21.255
It left a huge crater
as it narrowly missed

06:21.255 --> 06:24.671
a row of trailers
only 75-100 yards away.

06:24.671 --> 06:27.463
- ( jet engine roaring )
- Greg: While no one in the
mobile home force was hurt,

06:27.463 --> 06:30.505
several trailers were damaged
by flying debris.

06:30.505 --> 06:33.047
The entire area
was covered...

06:33.047 --> 06:35.588
( roaring engine
drowns out dialogue )

06:39.963 --> 06:43.172
( touch tones beeping )

06:43.172 --> 06:45.380
- ( line ringing )
- ( woman sniffles )

06:49.214 --> 06:51.838
( sighs )

06:51.838 --> 06:54.339
Woman on phone:
Edendhurst Medical.
May I help you?

06:54.339 --> 06:56.255
Woman:
Dr. Dan Benich, please.

06:56.255 --> 06:58.380
- Woman on phone:
One moment, please.
- Thank you.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.588
( music playing
over phone )

07:08.255 --> 07:10.505
Dan:
Dr. Benich.

07:10.505 --> 07:12.463
Are you alone?

07:14.671 --> 07:16.838
- Joan?
- Don't say my name
out loud.

07:16.838 --> 07:19.922
Joan?
What-- what the hell?

07:19.922 --> 07:22.130
Are you alone?

07:22.130 --> 07:24.255
I-- I'm alone.

07:24.255 --> 07:28.130
- I-- I'm confused.
- I'm okay.

07:28.130 --> 07:30.005
It's okay, I'm alive.

07:30.005 --> 07:32.588
Oh, my God.

07:32.588 --> 07:34.546
I didn't know what to do.

07:35.713 --> 07:37.255
Oh, God.

07:37.255 --> 07:39.089
It's me, my darling.

07:41.255 --> 07:42.755
I've been a wreck.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.255
Oh, God.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.963
I'm okay.

07:45.963 --> 07:48.130
- I thought you were--
- I know, but I'm not.

07:48.130 --> 07:50.630
I'm-- I'm here.

07:50.630 --> 07:54.380
- Okay.
- I should be dead,
but I'm here.

07:54.380 --> 07:57.005
Dan:
I was a mess over here.

07:57.005 --> 08:00.463
I couldn't talk
to anyone.

08:00.463 --> 08:02.421
It was so awful.
( crying )

08:02.421 --> 08:04.671
I saw this man

08:04.671 --> 08:07.297
yelling for his wife
and kids

08:07.297 --> 08:09.421
'cause they were
in another seat.

08:09.421 --> 08:13.630
And I just saw them
get completely engulfed
in flames.

08:15.380 --> 08:18.880
Dan:
All the telecasts
claim everyone is dead.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.922
Your picture
was on the news.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.089
Have you called
your kids?

08:26.838 --> 08:29.005
No.

08:29.005 --> 08:30.339
Steven?

08:31.713 --> 08:33.005
No.

08:36.255 --> 08:38.339
I'm the one
you called first?

08:39.797 --> 08:41.838
- Yeah.
- ( chuckles )

08:41.838 --> 08:43.089
My God.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.671
( exhales )

08:47.047 --> 08:49.089
- I thought about you.
- Yeah?

08:49.089 --> 08:51.255
When we were on the plane,
we flew over the highway,

08:51.255 --> 08:53.339
and I thought about you
in your car.

08:53.339 --> 08:55.172
I actually had
this thought.

08:57.005 --> 08:59.922
If I died on this flight,
I would be fine.

08:59.922 --> 09:02.880
- Oh, sweetheart.
- No, 'cause I can't--

09:02.880 --> 09:04.505
all this hiding
all these years,

09:04.505 --> 09:07.005
it's-- it's hell.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.214
I know.

09:09.214 --> 09:12.713
How can I see you?
Where are you?

09:12.713 --> 09:16.255
I'm at some ho-- motel.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.089
Does anyone else
know you're there?

09:21.421 --> 09:24.463
No, I don't think so.

09:24.463 --> 09:28.214
You remember you said
we would need a miracle...

09:30.755 --> 09:32.546
for us to be together?

09:32.546 --> 09:35.880
( breathing heavily )

09:35.880 --> 09:37.713
I think this is it.

09:43.214 --> 09:46.380
- ( knocking on door )
- Woman: Mrs. Smith?

09:46.380 --> 09:49.089
- ( knocking on door )
- Mrs. Smith?

09:51.005 --> 09:54.339
- Mrs. Teakins?
- Dan: Is someone at the door?

09:54.339 --> 09:57.089
Woman: Mrs. Teakins,
I know you used another
name to check in,

09:57.089 --> 09:59.047
- but I know it's you.
- Oh, my God.

09:59.047 --> 10:01.089
- Dan: What? Joanie, wait.
- ( knocking on door )

10:01.089 --> 10:04.214
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
- ( pounding on door )

10:04.214 --> 10:05.922
- Joanie, what's going on?
- I have to go.

10:05.922 --> 10:07.755
Dan:
No, wait, no!

10:12.297 --> 10:15.797
Woman:
Mrs. Teakins, are you
feeling all right?

10:15.797 --> 10:18.755
Have you felt
any kind of dizziness

10:18.755 --> 10:21.255
or weakness?

10:21.255 --> 10:23.797
Might've hit your head
and not even realized.

10:28.588 --> 10:31.089
Mrs. Teakins,
I know you're in there.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.546
( pounding on door )

10:32.546 --> 10:34.005
No, you've made a mistake.

10:34.005 --> 10:36.463
This is the wrong room.

10:36.463 --> 10:38.838
Woman:
I know that it's you.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.297
Flight 1438.

10:41.297 --> 10:44.130
Clipped the trees
up behind the hill.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.838
Crashed behind
Montgomery Ward
this morning.

10:48.505 --> 10:51.214
What do you want?

10:51.214 --> 10:53.463
I know that
you were on the plane.

10:53.463 --> 10:55.505
Just go away now!

10:55.505 --> 10:57.671
Mrs. Teakins, you may be
in a state of shock.

10:57.671 --> 10:59.214
- ( sighs )
- I have medical training.

10:59.214 --> 11:02.089
I could at least
check your vitals.

11:02.089 --> 11:03.963
I also brought you
some food.

11:06.089 --> 11:08.130
I even got you
a toothbrush.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.797
You were clutching
a yellow life jacket,

11:14.797 --> 11:16.838
walking on 28.

11:16.838 --> 11:19.130
There was only a single part
of the plane left intact

11:19.130 --> 11:21.380
after it bounced
through the trees.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.339
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:26.005 --> 11:27.713
You have a husband,

11:27.713 --> 11:29.339
two grown children.

11:32.380 --> 11:33.922
I saw them on the news.

11:33.922 --> 11:35.838
I wasn't on that flight.

11:35.838 --> 11:39.297
Mrs. Teakins, I really am
just here to help you.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.380
Mrs. Teakins?

11:47.505 --> 11:49.546
( rattling )

11:49.546 --> 11:51.297
Woman:
You're lucky you haven't
been found out yet,

11:51.297 --> 11:54.546
but the press
could catch wind any minute.

11:54.546 --> 11:57.380
Could be
a real zoo here soon.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.380
( knocking on door )

12:10.588 --> 12:12.505
( lock slides )

12:17.713 --> 12:19.671
( rain pattering )

12:32.880 --> 12:34.089
( door closes )

12:52.880 --> 12:55.297
Are you injured at all?

12:55.297 --> 12:56.421
No.

12:56.421 --> 13:00.130
No cuts, abrasions?

13:00.130 --> 13:01.089
No.

13:04.130 --> 13:06.089
Why all the blood
on the sheets, then?

13:07.380 --> 13:08.671
I--
( scoffs )

13:08.671 --> 13:10.546
I cut myself shaving.

13:13.214 --> 13:14.130
Woman:
Here.

13:15.255 --> 13:16.630
You must be ravenous.

13:48.546 --> 13:50.630
What is your name?

13:50.630 --> 13:52.505
Liza.

13:52.505 --> 13:55.880
And you're a paramedic?

13:55.880 --> 13:58.630
I was once trained
as a medic, yes.

14:03.838 --> 14:06.172
Wow.

14:06.172 --> 14:08.130
You must believe in God.

14:11.005 --> 14:13.339
What?

14:13.339 --> 14:15.047
You're like the phoenix.

14:15.047 --> 14:17.630
You just rose up
from the ashes

14:17.630 --> 14:19.130
and now you're here.

14:23.130 --> 14:27.130
I'm curious,
do you believe
in all that stuff--

14:27.130 --> 14:29.130
God and heaven?

14:34.505 --> 14:37.005
No, I do not.

14:38.505 --> 14:41.297
Why are you here?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.380
- I told you,
I'm here because--
- Yeah, I know, to help me.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.005
We both know
that's garbage.

14:46.963 --> 14:51.214
What are you,
like a reporter?

14:51.214 --> 14:55.588
Get the big story,
the-- the one woman
who survived the plane crash?

14:55.588 --> 14:58.172
- That would be a big story.
- Yes, big story.

14:58.172 --> 15:01.214
Any young reporter
would want to get
that scoop.

15:01.214 --> 15:03.005
That does make sense.

15:04.214 --> 15:05.421
Uh-huh.

15:09.713 --> 15:12.255
- Okay.
- "Okay"?

15:12.255 --> 15:15.255
What, you're just gonna come
into my room and I'm just gonna
tell you my whole story?

15:15.255 --> 15:16.880
What about me?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.546
You're just gonna
sell it to the papers?

15:18.546 --> 15:19.546
What about me?

15:19.546 --> 15:22.255
What about the story
that I want?

15:23.505 --> 15:26.255
Well, that's a fair point.

15:26.255 --> 15:27.838
If it's your story,

15:27.838 --> 15:29.755
then why don't you
tell it to me?

15:30.838 --> 15:32.588
Who are you, Joan?

15:35.255 --> 15:36.880
Oh, God, you're good.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.588
( laughs )
Oh, my-- oh, you're good.

15:39.588 --> 15:40.963
I get it.

15:40.963 --> 15:43.421
I get it, you come in here
and you're all,

15:43.421 --> 15:44.963
"I'm here to help you."

15:44.963 --> 15:46.588
Yeah, and then
I tell you everything.

15:46.588 --> 15:48.380
You're a very-- you're
a very good reporter.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.546
Very good.

15:54.463 --> 15:55.713
All right, well,
I finished eating.

15:55.713 --> 15:57.255
I'd like you to leave now.

16:00.463 --> 16:01.922
( sighs )

16:05.630 --> 16:08.463
I asked you to leave.

16:08.463 --> 16:10.922
But you don't
really want me to.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.339
( laughing )

16:17.339 --> 16:19.297
Really?

16:19.297 --> 16:21.130
- Yes.
- Oh.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.797
Okay.

16:24.463 --> 16:27.922
Well, please,
you know, enlighten me.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.172
You walked away
from a plane crash

16:37.172 --> 16:39.172
and checked
into this motel.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.671
You could've called
your family,

16:41.671 --> 16:42.755
but you didn't.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.172
You're trapping me.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.047
You've trapped yourself,
haven't you, Joan?

16:50.047 --> 16:54.255
I don't want any--
there to be any story
about me.

16:54.255 --> 16:56.755
And why is that?

16:56.755 --> 16:58.421
Is it because
you haven't decided

16:58.421 --> 17:00.505
what you want
your story to be yet?

17:02.005 --> 17:03.713
Is it because
part of you

17:03.713 --> 17:05.588
wants to stay here?

17:05.588 --> 17:08.838
Call your family,
tell them you're okay.

17:08.838 --> 17:10.671
Go back to that life.

17:10.671 --> 17:13.880
It wasn't a perfect life,
but it was a life.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.588
And you put
a big down payment on it

17:15.588 --> 17:17.339
and you want
to see it through.

17:17.339 --> 17:20.214
Out of a sense of duty
and obligation.

17:22.671 --> 17:24.172
But there's
another part of you

17:24.172 --> 17:26.838
that wants to walk
through that door

17:26.838 --> 17:29.214
to a new life entirely.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.214
( breathing heavily )

17:32.214 --> 17:34.047
Tell me, Joan,

17:34.047 --> 17:37.005
who was it
you were speaking to
on the phone just now?

17:38.047 --> 17:39.089
I'm not judging you.

17:39.089 --> 17:41.380
I'm just here to help.

17:41.380 --> 17:44.172
Were you listening
to my conversation?

17:44.172 --> 17:46.130
Were you eavesdropping
through the door?

17:46.130 --> 17:48.005
- That doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters!

17:48.005 --> 17:50.047
- It's my life!
- I understand that, but--

17:50.047 --> 17:52.963
You don't
understand anything.

17:52.963 --> 17:56.421
You-- you make it
sound like it's this...

17:56.421 --> 17:59.713
simple decision
between these two things.

17:59.713 --> 18:02.380
( phone ringing )

18:02.380 --> 18:03.922
( crying )

18:08.838 --> 18:11.172
- Ah!
- Joan.

18:11.172 --> 18:15.214
- You need help.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, I do.

18:15.214 --> 18:17.588
I do, I do, I do.

18:17.588 --> 18:19.713
- ( ringing continues )
- What's his name, Joan?

18:19.713 --> 18:22.005
( dial tone )

18:22.005 --> 18:25.089
Dan can't help you
anymore.

18:25.089 --> 18:26.880
How do you know his name?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.297
Put down the phone.

18:28.297 --> 18:30.089
Are you spying on me?
How do you know everything?

18:30.089 --> 18:32.172
You need to make
a decision, Joan.

18:32.172 --> 18:34.963
Joan, put the phone down.

18:34.963 --> 18:36.713
You've got to focus.

18:38.755 --> 18:40.880
- Time is almost up, Joan.
- Stop.

18:43.005 --> 18:45.255
- This is not the answer
that you need.
- No.

18:45.255 --> 18:46.797
( muttering )

18:46.797 --> 18:49.421
- Joan, you have to choose.
- Will you shut up?

18:49.421 --> 18:52.630
- I'm not gonna decide!
- Stop!

18:52.630 --> 18:54.255
( crying )

19:01.297 --> 19:02.339
Good.

19:04.339 --> 19:06.463
Now, it's time for you
to make a decision.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.755
Would Steven
and the children
really miss you?

19:12.089 --> 19:14.297
That's a big part
of this.

19:14.297 --> 19:15.755
It's a hard question.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.797
I know it's very hard
for you.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.963
Perhaps even harder
is the question of...

19:22.963 --> 19:24.630
would they be
better off without you?

19:26.130 --> 19:28.671
'Cause you never
really were the mother

19:28.671 --> 19:32.005
or the wife you thought
you could be.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.963
You were really
just a big disappointment.

19:34.963 --> 19:36.671

I can't help you anymore.

22:46.755 --> 22:49.214
No, no. Wait.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.005
Yes?

22:55.671 --> 22:59.255
What are we gonna do
about my story?

22:59.255 --> 23:02.380
What-- what's gonna
happen to me?

23:03.671 --> 23:05.755
Liza:
What would you like
to happen?

23:07.588 --> 23:09.214
I don't know.

23:11.255 --> 23:12.588
