WEBVTT

00:04.296 --> 00:05.377
What are you doing?

00:05.589 --> 00:07.000
I heard you could
punch a hole in these

00:07.216 --> 00:08.832
and make them double-sided.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.378
Then it would have more storage?

00:10.594 --> 00:13.507
Yes, but I didn't pay
for a double-sided floppy disk.

00:13.889 --> 00:14.675
So?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.135
So it's an ethical dilemma.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.513
We have to take a shower
in the locker room next period,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.185
and that's what
you're worried about?

00:21.396 --> 00:24.309
Actually, I have
a bathing suit under my pants.

00:27.903 --> 00:28.734
Whoa.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.654
That girl just took
a book on geostatistics.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.151
Yeah, so?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.654
That's not required reading
for any science course.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.161
Maybe she wants
to squash a spider with it.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.580
No, look, she's reading it.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.165
Who is this mystery woman?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.459
Should we invite her
to have lunch with us?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.162
I don't know. So far,
it's just been you and me,

00:47.381 --> 00:48.667
and we know that works.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.874
Do we really want
to mess with success?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.376
We could think of it
as an experiment.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.964
Oh, you do know
how to push my buttons.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.507
All right, go ask her.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.841
Why me?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.768
Your lack of testosterone makes
you adorable to women.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.722
I can't argue with that.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.227
Hello.

01:12.281 --> 01:12.896
Hello.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.276
My name is Sheldon.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.115
Yeah, you're Sheldon Cooper.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.742
You know who I am?

01:17.953 --> 01:19.740
Well, there's only one
nine-year-old in high school,

01:19.955 --> 01:21.196
and you still have
your baby teeth.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.202
She knows who I am.
It's going well.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.618
What do you want?

01:27.838 --> 01:30.876
Would you like to have lunch
with me and my friend?

01:32.009 --> 01:32.715
Why?

01:32.926 --> 01:33.666
<i>Why else?</i>

01:33.885 --> 01:35.376
So we can have
a spirited conversation

01:35.596 --> 01:37.053
about geostatistics.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.631
You really are
as smart as everybody says.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.639
My teeth are small, but my
prefrontal cortex is enormous.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.328
<i>The addition of Libby brought</i>

02:07.544 --> 02:10.833
<i>a level of sophistication
to our lunchtime discussion.</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:13.290
<i>Her mom also packed
extra string cheese,</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:15.716
<i>which is a well-known
social lubricant.</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:17.043
You're gonna be a geologist.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.252
That's fascinating.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.462
Why'd you choose that?

02:19.681 --> 02:21.343
When I was a little girl,
my grandparents took me

02:21.558 --> 02:23.470
to Carlsbad Caverns,
and I was hooked.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.018
Exploring caves,
that is super cool.

02:26.438 --> 02:30.022
Disagree. Dark,
enclosed spaces are terrifying.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.433
I get scared putting on
a sweatshirt.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.110
- Hmm.
<i>- I've seen it.</i>

02:34.321 --> 02:35.857
Pretty entertaining.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.155
Do you know what you're going
to major in in college?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.367
I'm leaning towards quantum
chromodynamics, but who knows?

02:41.620 --> 02:44.408
A few years ago, I would've
said choo-choo trains.

02:45.040 --> 02:45.826
<i>What about you?</i>

02:46.041 --> 02:48.249
- Oh, geology for sure.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:49.412
Really?

02:49.628 --> 02:50.744
When did you decide that?

02:50.962 --> 02:53.045
A long time ago.
Eat your apple slices.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.006
So we eat in the
library every day.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.382
You're welcome to join us.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.054
It's much better
than the cafeteria.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.758
It's quiet, and a lot less food
gets thrown at us.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.519
Yeah. Maybe
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.350
Right.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.932
Maybe y'all will.

03:13.068 --> 03:13.979
Bye, Libby.

03:15.987 --> 03:16.977
"Y'all"?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.438
I'm assimilating.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.568
Shut up.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.952
So how was school today?

03:29.251 --> 03:30.287
Sheldon's got a girlfriend.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.118
- What?
- That's not true.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.795
Oh, yes, it is. I seen him
talking to her at school.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.339
Sheldon Lee Cooper, you dog.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.504
Is she cute?

03:38.719 --> 03:40.005
Compared to what?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.595
What grade is she in?

03:42.806 --> 03:43.842
Eleventh.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.174
An older woman. Nice.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.388
Most everybody's older than me.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.764
Why is that nice?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.642
So what do you think, George?

03:51.857 --> 03:54.440
Is it time to have
"the talk" with him?

03:54.735 --> 03:55.475
What talk?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.651
No talk. Nobody's talking.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.529
If "the talk" is in regards
to human reproduction,

04:00.782 --> 04:02.614
I already understand
how that works.

04:02.951 --> 04:03.941
How do you know that?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.322
I told him.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.953
Oh, Lord.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.080
<i>And so,
our little social circle</i>

04:14.296 --> 04:16.333
<i>grew from two to three.</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:19.207
<i>An early example of how people
are just drawn to me.</i>

04:19.509 --> 04:21.250
Are you saying
that without geology,

04:21.470 --> 04:23.928
there'd be
no theory of evolution?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.755
Charles Lyell taught
Charles Darwin

04:25.974 --> 04:27.966
the Earth was much, much older
than anyone thought,

04:28.185 --> 04:29.892
which gave Darwin the courage
to figure out

04:30.103 --> 04:32.436
all species evolved
over billions of years.

04:32.898 --> 04:33.888
That's good.
I can use that

04:34.107 --> 04:36.440
to humiliate my pastor
at Sunday school.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.060
I don't know
what's more beautiful,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.861
your mind or your eyes.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.730
Tam, please.

04:42.949 --> 04:43.814
We're eating.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.373
You know spying
on kids is creepy.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.790
I wasn't spying on kids,
I was s-spying on your brother.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.753
Why won't you just go inside?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.092
Well, then, it wouldn't
be spying, now would it?

05:05.722 --> 05:06.803
Oh.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.844
<i>Oh, what?</i>

05:09.059 --> 05:10.595
You didn't mention
she was black.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.393
Was I supposed to?

05:12.604 --> 05:14.391
No, 'course not.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.306
Then why bring it up?

05:16.525 --> 05:18.687
It just wasn't
what I was expecting.

05:18.902 --> 05:19.983
What were you expecting?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.231
It's a big school.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.312
Why are you right here?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.774
They've got some books in there
about Martin Luther King.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.029
Maybe you should go read one.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.535
Morning.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.955
So why did it take
people so long

05:37.170 --> 05:38.911
to believe in continental drift,

05:39.130 --> 05:41.372
when it's obvious
that Africa and South America

05:41.591 --> 05:44.254
- fit together like a puzzle?
- No, they don't.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.343
People didn't understand
continental drift

05:46.555 --> 05:48.968
because they didn't understand
seafloor spreading.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.219
What?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.265
I'm both threatened

05:52.477 --> 05:54.389
and delighted by your brain.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.512
I'm just delighted by it.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.519
<i>They do fit.</i>

05:59.985 --> 06:01.351
That's nuts.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.535
"Geologists lead
a sedimentary lifestyle."

06:11.746 --> 06:13.658
Libby, that is a good one.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.537
Can you believe
what's going on with him?

06:17.752 --> 06:18.583
I know.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.787
He's been on the phone with
that girl for almost an hour.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.497
Sheldon's got
a girlfriend.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.672
What are the odds?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.420
She's not a girlfriend,

06:25.635 --> 06:28.298
it's more of a mental rapport.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.345
That's where it starts.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.719
I did win you over
with my superior intellect.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.675
It was your motorcycle
and you know it.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.807
Good thing it wasn't
your masculine physique,

06:37.022 --> 06:38.684
because that is long gone.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.020
Why do you think
I kept the motorcycle?

06:43.445 --> 06:45.437
How come he gets to tie up
the phone and I can't?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.897
Because what is happening
in there is called a miracle,

06:48.116 --> 06:50.608
and God-fearing people do not
get in the way of those.

06:51.286 --> 06:51.901
<i>Hey, Georgie,</i>

06:52.120 --> 06:53.236
if you ever find a girlfriend,

06:53.455 --> 06:55.117
maybe you can go on a double
date with your brother.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.914
She's not his girlfriend.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.741
And I can find one...

06:58.960 --> 07:00.076
I'm just not looking.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.082
<i>Yes, that was a geology joke.</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:04.289
We gotta get that <i>Sports
Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue

07:04.507 --> 07:07.124
away from him before he's
ruined forever.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.798
<i>Oh, Libby, Libby, Libby.</i>

07:10.347 --> 07:11.554
What is happening?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.051
<i>What was happening was,</i>

07:13.266 --> 07:14.882
<i>like many men before me,</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:19.095
<i>I was being seduced
by the exotic world of geology.</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:37.412
<i>We searched for tektites
in a nearby ravine.</i>

07:37.624 --> 07:39.536
<i>Tektites are natural glass</i>

07:39.751 --> 07:41.959
<i>formed
during meteorite impacts.</i>

07:42.379 --> 07:44.120
<i>They also bear
a close resemblance</i>

07:44.339 --> 07:46.797
<i>to raccoon feces,
so I wisely adopted</i>

07:47.050 --> 07:49.588
<i>a "no touching tektites"
policy.</i>

07:53.890 --> 07:54.846
It's called perfect cleavage

07:55.058 --> 07:56.924
when gypsum separates
this cleanly.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.593
<i>I was so proud of Tam</i>

07:58.812 --> 08:00.929
<i>for not making
an immature cleavage joke.</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:03.389
Look at me,
I'm touching cleavage.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.641
<i>Until he made one.</i>

08:06.486 --> 08:09.149
<i>And, like
Mother Nature's piÃ±ata,</i>

08:09.364 --> 08:12.528
<i>geodes contained
a secret surprise inside.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:13.737
<i>But you didn't have to suffer</i>

08:13.952 --> 08:16.410
<i>through a birthday party
to enjoy it.</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:21.786
How's it going?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.618
Well, I think I figured out
the problem.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.953
What is it?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.455
I'm a terrible mechanic.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.339
<i>- What's up?</i>
- Well,

08:29.551 --> 08:31.087
Sheldon's been spending
quite a bit of time

08:31.302 --> 08:32.759
with this Libby girl, lately.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.006
Yeah, so?

08:34.222 --> 08:35.508
So isn't he a little young

08:35.724 --> 08:37.306
to be hanging with teenagers?

08:37.683 --> 08:39.015
Oh, he's only young
on the outside.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.933
Inside, he's an old man.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.307
I'm being serious.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.520
So am I.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.603
And with that bowtie,
he's old on the outside, too.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.568
Sorry I bothered.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.771
Hang on.

08:53.825 --> 08:54.531
What did you think
was gonna happen

08:54.743 --> 08:55.984
when we sent him to high school?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.531
I don't know...
that he'd learn stuff

08:58.747 --> 09:01.330
and then, come back home
and be my baby forever.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.908
Mare, it's good for him.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.665
He may start college in a couple
years, what happens then?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.669
Off the top of my head,
he and I share a dorm room.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.926
You know I'd laugh at that
if I didn't kind of believe you.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.392
What are you doing?

09:25.607 --> 09:29.476
I need to use the bathroom, but
it can get uncivilized in there.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.859
Anyone in there now?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.529
I don't know.
I was afraid to find out.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.982
Anybody in here?

09:37.952 --> 09:38.612
Go ahead.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.864
I'll stand guard.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.996
Where have you been all my life?

09:49.297 --> 09:51.004
I don't think so.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.627
I gotta pee.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.676
That's <i>your</i> problem.
Keep moving.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.142
- Thank you.
- Happy to help.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.060
Is there any chance
you'd be available

10:05.271 --> 10:07.263
to stand guard at 1:45?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.939
You have a bathroom schedule?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.398
You don't?

10:10.902 --> 10:11.892
See you later.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.941
<i>Whoever said the
quickest way to a man's heart</i>

10:15.156 --> 10:16.567
<i>is through his stomach</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:19.446
<i>did not consider
his tiny bladder.</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:24.454
I think the best space shuttle
name so far is <i>Discovery.</i>

10:24.666 --> 10:25.577
What about <i>Challenger?</i>

10:25.959 --> 10:28.042
- Too in-your-face.
<i>- Atlantis?</i>

10:28.294 --> 10:30.251
A fictional island
that couldn't stay afloat?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.453
I don't think so.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.380
- There's the <i>Enterprise.</i>
- There is,

10:33.591 --> 10:35.583
and it's on <i>Star Trek,</i> where it belongs.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.630
You know they're playing
a space shuttle movie

10:37.846 --> 10:39.087
at the Museum of
Natural Science.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.255
- It's in IMAX.
- I heard about that.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.306
- The screen is supposed to be huge.
- They also have

10:43.518 --> 10:44.759
a great geology exhibit.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.594
Well, it's in Houston...

10:46.813 --> 10:48.850
- how are we gonna get there?
- I'll drive.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.848
Oh, I would love to
see a movie with you.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.774
Don't you need to ask
your parents first?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.353
- No, Sheldon, I don't.
- But won't they worry where you are?

10:55.572 --> 10:56.779
They'll be fine.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.238
Count me in.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.317
Glad you're not <i>my</i> son.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.158
And now he wants to see a
movie in Houston with them.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.412
Why Houston?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.914
I don't know,
it's in MixMax or something.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.621
So you're saying I got
to drive to Houston?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.706
No. This girl Libby's
gonna drive.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.124
Great.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.675
It's not great, George.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.753
I don't want my little boy
in some car

11:20.972 --> 11:22.508
with a teenager
behind the wheel.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.386
All high school kids drive.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.308
Yeah? Well, I
don't like it.

11:26.728 --> 11:27.639
Would you let <i>me</i> get in a car

11:27.854 --> 11:29.470
with a stranger
when I was young?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.897
Well, nobody ever asked you out,
so it didn't really matter.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.158
Hey. I want to talk to you.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.493
Hold on. Let me bring
this into the station

11:45.705 --> 11:48.322
so as not to disappoint
my commuters.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.578
They'd like to get home
to their families.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.290
I gave it a lot of thought,
and I'm afraid I can't allow you

11:57.508 --> 11:58.999
to drive to Houston
with your friends.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.300
Why?

12:00.511 --> 12:01.968
Well, honey, you're
still a little boy.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.136
I don't think it's right.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.840
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a high school student.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.142
I'm sorry, I made up my mind.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.885
If you'd really like
to see this movie,

12:10.104 --> 12:11.265
I'm willing to drive you.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.767
Maybe we could meet
your friends there.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.019
I don't want my
<i>mommy</i> to take me.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.226
Well, then, you're not going.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.029
<i>Anger is an ugly emotion.</i>

12:21.241 --> 12:23.449
<i>Unbridled rage even more so.</i>

12:23.660 --> 12:25.993
<i>And when it bubbled up
inside me,</i>

12:26.204 --> 12:28.947
<i>I channeled it
the only way I knew how.</i>

12:32.210 --> 12:35.294
<i>I cleaned the house
like a man possessed.</i>

12:54.023 --> 12:55.434
I can't hear Oprah!

12:55.817 --> 12:57.024
I don't care!

13:01.990 --> 13:03.481
Sheldon, I need to get in there.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.740
Poop at Meemaw's!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.961
You missed a spot, weirdo.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.633
I see it.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.139
What am I supposed
to do with this?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.851
Send him over to my house
before he runs out of gas.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.737
All right, I'll make
a deal with you.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.033
I'm listening.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.490
You can go to Houston
with your friends,

13:51.706 --> 13:53.538
but I want to meet
this girl first.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.583
That's very reasonable.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.454
Thank you.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.252
You're welcome.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.417
Now, can you please reach
the dryer sheets?

14:01.632 --> 14:04.670
I get vertigo on the step stool.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.215
<i>I've often been accused</i>

14:07.430 --> 14:09.092
<i>of being stubborn and willful,</i>

14:09.307 --> 14:12.175
<i>but sometimes
it works like gangbusters.</i>

14:15.688 --> 14:16.519
Please come in.

14:16.731 --> 14:17.972
Have a seat.

14:18.775 --> 14:19.686
You have a
beautiful home.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.517
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.771
<i>I hope you'll forgive me,
I just wanted to meet</i>

14:25.990 --> 14:28.607
the person driving
my nine-year-old son to Houston.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.566
I understand.

14:29.786 --> 14:30.572
Me, too.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.028
I wasn't talking to you, Tam.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.246
And I just wanted
to make certain

14:35.458 --> 14:36.869
that you've had
no traffic tickets

14:37.085 --> 14:38.872
or, heaven forbid, accidents.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.953
No, ma'am. I'm a
very safe driver.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.505
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Good.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.174
<i>Good. Have you made
this trip before?</i>

14:46.511 --> 14:48.298
- A few times, yes.
- Mm-hmm.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.880
Mm-hmm.
You smoke marijuana?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.011
- Mom!
- No, ma'am.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.091
Just say no.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.929
Well...

14:59.148 --> 15:00.730
I find this very reassuring.

15:00.942 --> 15:01.773
<i>I have to admit,</i>

15:01.984 --> 15:03.896
I had some trepidation, but...

15:04.237 --> 15:07.025
having met you,
I'm feeling a lot better.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.903
Good. You've got nothing
to worry about, Mrs. Cooper.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.030
I've been babysitting kids
for years.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.536
<i>Babysitting... babysitting...</i>

15:15.623 --> 15:17.364
Babysitting.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.372
<i>Babysitting... babysitting...
I've been babysitting kids for years.</i>

15:21.587 --> 15:22.828
Excuse me.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.621
I don't feel well.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.082
You'll have to go without me.

15:34.809 --> 15:35.469
<i>Shelly,</i>

15:35.685 --> 15:36.721
you okay?

15:38.354 --> 15:39.435
No.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.058
You want to talk about it?

15:41.983 --> 15:42.894
No.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.358
You want me to leave you alone?

15:46.696 --> 15:47.561
No.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.950
I thought Libby and I
were equals,

15:54.162 --> 15:56.245
but she thinks of me as a child.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.200
I'm sorry, baby.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.786
Calling me that
isn't helping right now.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.709
Right. Sorry.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.128
She is almost twice your age.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.080
There are people
<i>five</i> times my age

16:07.300 --> 16:09.041
that are stupider than me.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.967
This is not about being smart.

16:11.429 --> 16:13.295
- What else <i>is</i> there?
- Well...

16:13.556 --> 16:15.548
there's other kinds of maturity.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.011
What's up?

16:17.727 --> 16:18.968
None of your business.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.393
Why is he crying?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.312
Again, it's none
of your business.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.354
Please go.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.400
Fine. Celeste and I know
when we aren't wanted.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.395
Where were we?

16:30.615 --> 16:31.947
Different kinds of maturity.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.444
That's right.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.279
There's emotional maturity,
physical maturity,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.956
all things that have nothing
to do with being smart.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.622
Are you suggesting
I'm not emotionally mature?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.372
I was hinting at it.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.672
Regardless, I'm not interested
in making any more friends.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.501
Oh, I don't think
that's how you really feel.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.843
It is.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.298
From now on,
it's a hermit's life for me.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.850
I bet, when you grow up,
you will be surrounded

17:00.061 --> 17:04.521
by lots of smart,
wonderful friends.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.227
I can't see that happening.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.313
<i>Well,</i>

17:08.778 --> 17:11.065
the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.564
And here we go
with the God talk.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.872
Hey.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.203
Hey.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.829
How was the IMAX movie?

17:27.338 --> 17:28.124
Well...

17:29.840 --> 17:31.376
<i>Okay, status. Find them?</i>

17:31.759 --> 17:33.421
<i>- Go.
- Guidance...</i>

17:36.472 --> 17:37.679
What are you doing?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.511
What do
you think I'm doing?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.184
Move your arm
before I rip it off.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.976
It got a little uncomfortable.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.606
Why is that?

17:49.110 --> 17:50.897
Libby's got feelings for me,

17:51.112 --> 17:52.728
but I think it's better
we just stay friends.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.860
I've been giving
geology some more thought.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.065
Yeah, and?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.902
I've decided
it's not really a science.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.613
- It's not?
- No, it's more like a hobby.

18:02.832 --> 18:03.948
Rock collecting.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.748
Childish, really.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.243
I can see that.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.831
<i>As you can see,</i>

18:09.046 --> 18:12.005
<i>sometimes a person can be
both incredibly intelligent</i>

18:12.216 --> 18:13.878
<i>and full of baloney.</i>
