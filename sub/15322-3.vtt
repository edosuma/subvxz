WEBVTT

00:59.685 --> 01:01.141
What the hell, Linden?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.432
What do you want, Holder?

01:04.439 --> 01:06.725
Next time you decide
to work my case,

01:06.775 --> 01:08.982
you mind giving me
a heads-up?

01:09.027 --> 01:11.109
It's a crime scene.
I called the cops.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.856
How'd you find this place?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.820
Sarah?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.999
This is Adrian.
I saw him this morning.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.251
He's drawing again.
He drew that.

01:32.718 --> 01:36.051
Lieutenant, we got
the press vans headed our way.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.309
Just hold them off
till I get there.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.216
Copy that.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.520
I'll see you
back at the station.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.574
Looks like
you found the Seward file.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.698
Now, we've got 17 bodies

02:43.747 --> 02:46.284
in what used to be
a retention pond

02:46.291 --> 02:48.668
west of the I-5 near SeaTac.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.087
So far, it's our only dump site,
but there could be more.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.747
Initial reports indicate that
the killer used the same blade

02:54.800 --> 02:56.631
with enough force to nearly--

02:56.677 --> 03:00.044
well, in some cases, completely
decapitate his victims.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.965
Now, judging from the size
of the remains,

03:04.017 --> 03:08.727
MEs are guessing teenagers,
all female,

03:08.772 --> 03:11.684
some as young as 12 or 13.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.025
Forensics is working
around the clock.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.903
County coroner's
pitched in, too.

03:17.906 --> 03:22.696
So far, they've matched wound
patterns to three of the bodies.

03:22.744 --> 03:27.283
We also got a positive match
to Ashley Kwon.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.747
14-year-old runaway,
working girl.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.833
Found in a West Seattle factory

03:31.878 --> 03:34.620
about a half a mile
from the dump site.

03:34.673 --> 03:38.541
Her body was found
four days ago.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.629
Meaning we could have
an active serial.

03:40.679 --> 03:45.173
Now, having said that,

03:45.183 --> 03:46.923
I'd like to disabuse you
of any notion

03:46.977 --> 03:48.933
that we're out searching
for Hannibal Lecter.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.891
We're not gonna be finding
any skin suits.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.273
He's not gonna be sending us
some lady's head in a box.

03:55.318 --> 03:59.277
My guess is this guy's
killing hookers and runaways

03:59.322 --> 04:02.610
because no one's looking
for them, right?

04:02.659 --> 04:08.245
This case is gonna be solved
with good, solid police work,

04:08.290 --> 04:11.453
not some PhD's half-baked
psychological profile.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.122
"Well, you know, based
on the nature of the wounds,

04:14.129 --> 04:15.960
we can tell that he's angry..."

04:15.964 --> 04:18.171
Well, no shit.
He's angry.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.465
All right.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.092
The Kwon girl.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.551
She was last seen three days
before her time of death.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.888
So, it's possible that our
killer's abducting his victims

04:29.895 --> 04:32.477
and holding them
before he kills them.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.060
But first order of business is
we got to identify these bodies,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.565
so we're gonna need all
the Missing-Persons reports

04:37.611 --> 04:39.101
- in the Seattle-Tacoma area--
- Sir.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.773
Holder.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.022
I got a report
from a street kid

04:43.074 --> 04:45.486
about a girl gone missing
recently.

04:45.494 --> 04:46.825
She fits our profiles.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.986
She's 15 years old,
working girl.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.199
Her name's Kallie Leeds,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.246
and none of the kids
she associates with

04:52.250 --> 04:53.990
have seen her
in a couple of days.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.367
Okay, great.
Give it to Linden.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.500
She'll be handling the IDs

04:56.546 --> 04:57.956
till her hire-back
paperwork's complete.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.746
You guys, shake up the locals,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.542
find out if the Kwon girl
had representation.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.583
Now, what else?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.717
Um... oh, right.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.800
The red bags that were found
on the bodies--

05:07.849 --> 05:11.762
they were biohazard-grade,
medical, institutional use.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.599
Hey, Loo, how did we
find the bodies?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.221
Anonymous tip.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.775
All right, thank you.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.668
Anonymous tip?

05:38.713 --> 05:42.205
Well, Seward's execution's
on the front page

05:42.259 --> 05:43.795
of every newspaper.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.835
First hanging in 20 years.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.594
Last thing you want to do
is throw oil on that bonfire.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.347
Obviously we can't exhume
Trisha Seward's body

05:51.393 --> 05:52.758
to match wound patterns,

05:52.811 --> 05:55.097
so I'm gonna want
to talk to the kid.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.647
What is it
you think you got here?

05:56.690 --> 05:59.306
Trisha Seward's throat
was cut like Kwon's.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.727
She was a prostitute--

06:00.777 --> 06:02.642
Who was 15 years older
than our victims

06:02.654 --> 06:05.191
and whose husband had a long
history of domestic abuse.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.773
Adrian's been drawing again.
That factory is a new detail.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.906
Maybe he's remembering
something.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.283
Remembering what?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.778
I mean, his doctor said
he'd most likely never remember

06:12.831 --> 06:15.243
what happened that night
after what he went through.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.873
That's a good thing,
by the way.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.954
Maybe not for the case,
but for the kid.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.915
So, let him forget.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.080
James...

06:24.092 --> 06:26.083
Look, you do what
you got to do.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.967
Make this right for yourself.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.174
You want to talk to the kid,
I'm not gonna stop you.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.090
But I'm not giving Ray Seward
any ammunition for an appeal

06:33.143 --> 06:35.054
unless there's a damn
good reason to,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.684
and a kid's drawing isn't it.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.972
Trisha Seward deserves justice.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.856
Don't forget that.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.938
I want to know
if we can do this...

06:47.991 --> 06:49.276
Work together.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.443
Yeah.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.031
Yeah, of-- of course.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.241
There's no shame
in staying away.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.703
Things are good for you.
You got a life.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.743
No.
No, I found those bodies.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.877
I want to see this to the end.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.754
Then I need you
working this case,

07:04.799 --> 07:07.290
not picking apart a solve
from three years ago.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.016
Come on.
I need your John Hancock.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.729
It's as simple as that.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.489
Welcome back.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.121
This is cruel
and unusual punishment.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.383
Ain't nobody got
no water heater?

07:47.425 --> 07:49.290
Got 10 minutes, inmates.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.387
I need some heat!

07:54.432 --> 07:55.683
I want to get clean,

07:55.684 --> 07:57.424
I might as well go outside
and stand in the rain.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.593
'Cause this shower ain't nothing

07:59.646 --> 08:02.228
but some cold spit
on my head, man.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.603
Hey, Big Noise,
what's that ”A" for?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.076
What you got,
a honey named "A"?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.955
All the best white ladies
named "A."

08:20.000 --> 08:25.836
Andrea, Allison, Amy.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.257
I knew a girl named Annie.

08:28.299 --> 08:32.133
She was a freak.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.760
I remember that night
like it was yesterday.

08:34.806 --> 08:39.266
6-5-3-- what, you just keeping
her digits handy?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.563
The "A" is his son, Adrian.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.771
Oh, you got a son, Raymond?

08:48.778 --> 08:51.064
Yeah, Raymond,
what was your kid,

08:51.114 --> 08:53.856
5 or 6 when you cut
his mommy's head off?

08:55.410 --> 08:56.946
Left him sucking his thumb,

08:56.995 --> 08:58.986
looking at the hole
in her neck?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.372
Huh?

09:06.129 --> 09:07.369
Damn.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.375
Mm. You got cold hands.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.922
Sorry.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.428
That's all right.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.467
Idon't mind.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.259
You should get
some mittens or something.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.274
Slow down.
You're gonna choke.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.153
Hey, Joe, you seen Kallie?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.913
Nah. Why?

10:25.917 --> 10:28.374
I haven't seen her.
I don't know.

10:28.378 --> 10:32.462
You hear about the bodies
they found out by the airport?

10:32.507 --> 10:33.838
It's all over the news.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.999
I heard it might be
street girls.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.883
So, just be careful, okay?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.351
Hey, kid.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.603
You want my hash browns?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.439
Get a pair of mittens, okay?

11:07.542 --> 11:09.624
Hey, babe.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.785
You hungry?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.578
I got hash browns.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.685
Joe said the cops found
a bunch of dead working girls

11:32.734 --> 11:34.349
out near the airport.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.403
Baby, please.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.908
Are you awake?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.847
Can I come to LA with you?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.059
Please?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.360
Department's
best guys out here

12:20.406 --> 12:22.738
chasing pimps, with our pants
around our ankles.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.619
You know they hooked up.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.621
Who?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.908
Skinner and your old lady.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.036
Linden, man.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.626
Skinner and Linden
used to bang.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.666
Back when they worked together.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.465
Why do you think we're out here
tracking down pimps

12:45.515 --> 12:47.631
while she's back at the office
cozying up to the boss?

12:50.436 --> 12:53.348
Pension and a paycheck.

12:53.398 --> 12:56.515
Can't wait till I retire.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.023
I'll come back every year

12:58.069 --> 13:00.310
and do my 172 days
and make double.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.607
Linden quit.
She don't get a pension.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.077
Here we go.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.869
Seattle PD.
Get out of the car.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.666
No problem, officer.
This is not--

13:19.716 --> 13:21.502
- She's 18.
- How about you shut up?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.337
Stay put. I got a couple
of questions for you, sexy.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.965
You come here a lot, cowboy?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.051
Picking up teenyboppers
get you off?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.216
No way. She said
she was 18, officer.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.759
Yeah, yeah, shut up.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.892
You seen this girl?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.769
You want to ride around

13:35.815 --> 13:38.272
in the backseat of my car
the rest of the day?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.893
How about
you take a real look?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.152
I don't know her.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.452
How much does he pay you?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.280
He's not paying me.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.781
Where's Bullet?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.075
Girl who dresses like a boy?

13:57.086 --> 13:59.042
I don't know.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.582
You are done bobbin' apples
for today, baby girl.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.671
You're gonna have to find
some other way

14:06.721 --> 14:07.881
to pay for them braces.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.919
I'm taking them in.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.759
Looks like we're all
going for a ride.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.923
Maybe on Front Street.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.557
Front Street?

14:13.603 --> 14:14.809
The overpass?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.641
Bunch of kids skate there,
and I see her there sometimes.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.982
All right.
Get out of here.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.196
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.232
Well, if you ask me,
I would rip him a new one.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.991
Seriously.
You don't want to see me mad.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.402
'Cause, like, my face
gets all red

14:32.455 --> 14:33.695
and steam comes out of my ass.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.740
Hold up.

14:41.756 --> 14:42.745
Are you Danette Leeds?

14:42.799 --> 14:43.834
Yeah, I'm booked all day.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.464
Hey, don't touch
the back of that.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.799
You're gonna lose the curl.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.293
I'm sorry.
You gotta come back.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.545
I'm here about
your daughter, Kallie.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.930
It's cool, D.
I gotta go anyway.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.520
- See ya.
- Sorry.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.686
What is your daughter,
like 15?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.351
Look, she doesn't call me
every minute,

15:05.405 --> 15:06.986
telling me where she's at.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.237
You want to find her?

15:08.282 --> 15:10.068
Come back in a few days
when she runs out of money.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.528
Yeah.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.954
Maybe Children's Services
would be interested in the fact

15:13.955 --> 15:16.287
that your daughter doesn't
seem to go to school at all.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.376
Look, Ms... Whatever,
I can't control her,

15:22.422 --> 15:23.628
never have, never will.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.504
So, I-I got
another appointment.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.250
So, maybe you want to talk
to her friend Shotgun or Ammo

15:28.261 --> 15:29.546
- or something.
- Bullet.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.090
Do you know
where I can find her?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.050
Hell ifI know.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.883
You should tell your daughter
to be careful out there.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.725
Okay. Thanks
for the advice, Officer.

15:38.729 --> 15:42.563
It's Detective, actually.
Homicide.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.103
Hmm.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.557
Stay the hell out!

17:10.488 --> 17:11.978
Hey, Bullet.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.773
Don't make me
chase you down, Bullet.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.406
I just want to talk.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.655
I don't got to talk to you.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.369
I'm looking for
your friend Kallie.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.125
You find her yet?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.839
I don't talk to cops.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.719
Look, no one's got to find out
that you're talking to me.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.651
Goldie's got a room
in his place--

17:49.694 --> 17:51.525
- in his bedroom.
- Goldie? Who's Goldie?

17:51.529 --> 17:52.985
Some nobody, nothin' pimp!

17:57.285 --> 17:58.866
I think he's got her there.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.651
How'd you know?

18:00.705 --> 18:03.572
'Cause I was there.

18:03.583 --> 18:08.327
I heard someone crying
behind the door.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.665
It was locked.
I couldn't get in.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.336
Sounded like her.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.879
He's got a knife.
A big one. I saw it.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.467
Where's his place at?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.355
I don't want your money.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.438
All right.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.439
You got a car?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.897
Yeah. Come on.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.152
( "Pieces Of Me” plays )

18:35.197 --> 18:37.358
? Half a plan and no time
for missing this ?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.865
? there's no time
for looking back ?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.652
? don't you want to just
stand up for something ?

18:42.705 --> 18:45.617
? don't you want to just
rise for everything ?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.373
? one step closer
to the grave ?

18:48.419 --> 18:51.456
? four steps closer every day ?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.455
?no?

18:53.507 --> 18:56.635
? when words are like weapons ?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.002
? they're taking
their vengeance ?

19:02.183 --> 19:05.175
? ...at the seams ?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.385
Jesus.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.521
Kid's got to be like 12.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.605
Police! Hey!

19:15.655 --> 19:16.895
Stop! Right now!

19:20.284 --> 19:23.276
Bitch!
I told you not to run!

19:28.918 --> 19:30.749
Mom, I'm not gonna say
anything to him.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.786
Ijust want--

19:34.674 --> 19:38.667
Yeah, I got a coat, ma.
God.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.715
I gotta go. Fine.
Whatever.

19:41.764 --> 19:45.052
I used up all my minutes.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.520
Uh, hello?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.063
It's out.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.935
What a bitch.

19:53.943 --> 19:58.403
The only thing my mom's fat ass
loves is a casserole.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.438
At least you got a mom.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.732
I hate her.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.739
I have to wait for a while
before I call her again.

20:05.788 --> 20:06.903
Hey, you guys.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.743
I'm looking for a girl
named Bullet.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.670
Can I get a cigarette?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.206
- Rayna.
- What?

20:18.259 --> 20:19.294
Yeah.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.933
So, where is she?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.062
She's not in trouble.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.393
Ijust need to talk to her.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.399
Yeah, well, she already
got arrested.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.400
What do you mean?

20:46.495 --> 20:49.202
Saw her driving off
with some Eminem wannabe

20:49.206 --> 20:50.707
with a molester 'stache.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.295
You're welcome.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.251
Those ain't mine.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.045
I don't know how
they got there.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.426
16, white, unshaved.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.758
Ooh, that's nasty, man.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.465
I like my hedges trimmed,

21:09.518 --> 21:11.258
my bitches grown.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.973
Yeah?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.641
What happened to your face?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.149
Yeah, what happened?

21:16.150 --> 21:18.812
Cut myself shaving.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.273
Looks like you got in a fight
with a bank teller.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.028
They got
those long fingernails.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.113
Or a little girl?

21:28.162 --> 21:31.620
Like I said, man,
those DVDs ain't mine.

21:31.665 --> 21:35.578
There's all sorts of lowlifes
coming in and out of my pad

21:35.628 --> 21:36.913
all day long.

21:36.921 --> 21:40.209
Huh. So, tell me
about this rape.

21:40.257 --> 21:44.546
2011, you were 27 years old.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.460
Victim was 13.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.800
Thejudge
got it all twisted, man.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.350
She was beggin' for it.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.305
So you do like 'em young.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.851
Nah, man, it was all
a misunderstanding.

21:57.858 --> 21:58.847
What, do you?

21:58.859 --> 22:02.647
Yeah, I mean, 16, 17,

22:02.696 --> 22:05.358
growing into themselves,
almost a woman.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.444
Well... not many men
would admit it.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.984
Mnh-mnh.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.652
I take care of my girls.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.242
I protect 'em
from psychos like you.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.872
Like the 13-year-old?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.122
They got to
make their money, man.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.502
They're gonna do it anyway.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.960
Somebody's got to
show 'em how it's done, right?

22:22.967 --> 22:24.832
It's business.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.295
You want to know
what you're selling.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.338
I get that.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.377
Yeah, that makes sense.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.886
Break 'em in.

22:29.932 --> 22:33.265
What about these movies?
That business, too?

22:33.269 --> 22:34.679
Smaﬂ.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.520
Give your customers a sample
of what your girls look like,

22:37.523 --> 22:39.263
what they can do, like a--

22:39.275 --> 22:41.561
like a menu of services
kind of thing.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.690
Yeah.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.397
Just because I fill a need

22:44.446 --> 22:47.279
doesn't mean
I'm some sick freak like him.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.031
So you fill a need.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.568
So you're like
the distributor, then.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.532
I didn't say that.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.823
Yeah, you kind of did.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.207
No, I ain't said that, man.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.117
You guys are doing
that cop thing,

23:00.129 --> 23:02.586
trying to put words in my mouth.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.417
Detective Reddick,
didn't he just say that?

23:04.466 --> 23:06.002
They're good.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.007
Not gonna get this guy
to cop to murder, though.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.843
He's done time before.
He knows the system.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.550
Let me refer to my notes.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.510
Do we like him for it?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.299
He has a history
with young girls,

23:15.352 --> 23:16.637
access to victim population.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.554
It's a possibility.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.476
We tossed his place.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.516
The knife Holder's CI
told us about

23:23.569 --> 23:25.525
isn't a match
for the murder weapon.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.448
Maybe there's a connect

23:28.490 --> 23:30.617
between the girls in
his porn tapes and our bodies.

23:30.618 --> 23:34.827
What about the missing girl--
Kallie Leeds?

23:34.830 --> 23:36.161
You talk to her mom?

23:36.165 --> 23:37.905
Yeah, she says
her daughter is not missing

23:37.958 --> 23:39.869
even though she hasn't seen her
in several days.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.784
Mother of the year.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.255
What about her?

23:47.301 --> 23:49.257
Kallie Leeds.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.261
Think.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.890
Think before you answer.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.768
Carefully consider your options,
brother.

23:58.812 --> 24:02.646
We're the last friends you got.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.147
Yeah, I th--
I thought about it, brother.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.117
And I want my lawyer.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.335
It doesn't matter.
We got him for the kiddie porn,

24:25.381 --> 24:27.838
possession,
intent to distribute.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.125
No, I want him for the bodies.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.045
Now, if this guy's got
the Leeds girl and she's alive,

24:34.098 --> 24:35.383
he'll try and kill her.

24:35.432 --> 24:39.175
If she's dead, he might
go back to the dump site.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.846
So we sit on his ass
for 72 hours,

24:42.898 --> 24:43.933
see what he does.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.519
That's risky.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.823
Get IDs on his girls
in the porn tapes.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.527
Find out where the coroner's at
on our bodies.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.612
How you doin'?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.033
Being back, I mean.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.501
It's fine.

25:06.547 --> 25:09.459
Wondering if you made
the right choice?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.214
Yeah.
Something like that.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.599
Jen talked to me after I left
your house the other day.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.384
What did you tell her?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.554
What do you mean?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.398
She knows about us.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.286
Yo, Linden.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.913
What, are you mad at me now?

25:46.003 --> 25:48.369
looking for some kid that
you had already talked to.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.458
I heard Bullet
put you onto that guy.

25:50.507 --> 25:51.963
I guess we're even.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.749
No we're not even even.
I

25:53.802 --> 25:56.179
You're still
like minus-three.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.552
You know, it might be helpful

25:57.598 --> 25:59.930
if we were on the same page
on this, Linden.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.307
You know, no man is an island,
not even you.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.020
Adrian Seward drew those trees.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.855
That's why I was in the woods.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.269
Picasso.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.142
How'd he know about the bodies?

26:12.196 --> 26:13.686
I don't know
if he did or didn't.

26:13.739 --> 26:14.728
He lived near the woods.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.105
It might not mean anything.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.489
You talk to him?

26:17.534 --> 26:19.786
No.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.329
So you do think
there's a connection

26:21.371 --> 26:23.111
between the Seward murder
and our bodies?

26:24.458 --> 26:27.871
Her finger was broken,
just like your girl's.

26:27.920 --> 26:32.084
I think her killer
took a trophy, a ring, too.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.303
This system is broke.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.136
You that boy's
only parental figure.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.675
Boys need a father.

26:44.686 --> 26:48.304
Bet you ain't had no father
growing up.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.564
I just think you need
to holler at your lawyer,

26:50.609 --> 26:51.894
tell her for the kid,

26:51.944 --> 26:54.060
they ought to reduce
your sentence and let you live.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.523
Boy done lost his mom.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.939
And now the State trying to kill
the only father he got?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.111
That ain't right.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.485
Poor little bastard.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.530
How's the wife and kid,
Francis?

27:05.582 --> 27:10.292
Hmm? 'Cause I seen them waiting
for you in the parking lot.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.628
That's so sweet.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.467
Your boy looks like you.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.597
Soon little orphan Adrian's
gonna have nobody.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.728
That's a shame.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.894
You gonna let him disrespect you
like that, Big Noise?

27:32.943 --> 27:36.151
Your boy, your blood?

27:36.196 --> 27:39.063
Come on, man! Damn!

27:39.116 --> 27:42.825
You got to man up.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.828
Disrespect your son,
walk his ass off.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.706
Hi.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.249
You're Adrian, right?

28:00.512 --> 28:01.718
I'm Sarah.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.587
Do you remember me?

28:04.892 --> 28:08.635
We met before.
I'm a detective.

28:11.857 --> 28:16.521
You drew me this, remember?

28:16.570 --> 28:19.687
Can you tell me what you
were drawing in this picture?

28:22.201 --> 28:25.693
You added a factory.
Why?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.695
Please, Adrian.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.446
I want to see him.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.160
Who?

28:31.168 --> 28:32.658
Adﬂan?

28:34.213 --> 28:35.202
Who?

28:35.255 --> 28:36.995
My dad.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.129
Adrian.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.467
I'll see what I can do, okay?
I've got to go.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.809
You got any move
on the suspect?

28:56.443 --> 28:58.684
Nope. Pimp's been holed up

28:58.737 --> 29:00.443
watching TV for the
last two hours.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.445
We'll let you know.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.231
Copy.

29:06.954 --> 29:10.663
Poor guy-- all he's got left to
jerk off to is diaper commercials.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.586
You got big plans
for V-Day?

29:21.051 --> 29:22.916
V-Day?

29:22.970 --> 29:26.337
February 14th, Holder.
Jesus.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.428
Mm.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.463
Got to make a reservation,

29:28.517 --> 29:29.927
jump through those hoops,
brother.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.763
All the best
places will be booked.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.427
You and Caroline will end up

29:33.480 --> 29:36.062
eating pot stickers
at Applebee's.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.397
Get out of the car!

29:37.442 --> 29:39.307
- Get out of the car!
- Jesus.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.976
- Get out! - Take care of this
before she blows this whole thing.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.064
Get off me!

29:42.114 --> 29:43.775
Calm down, Bullet.
Shut up.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.439
Don't tell me what to do.
Where is she?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.948
Where is she, huh?
Where's Kallie?

29:46.994 --> 29:48.655
- We didn't find her there, okay?
We're looking. - Tell me!

29:48.704 --> 29:50.365
Some big hero cop you are.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.529
- I'm taking care of it, all right?
- Really?

29:51.581 --> 29:54.118
I'm a rat now,
and everybody's gonna know it.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.499
- You said-- you promised me
that you'd lock him up. - All right--

29:56.503 --> 29:58.915
- You lying cop.
- Just calm down, okay?

29:58.964 --> 30:01.797
Don't tell me what to do!

30:01.842 --> 30:04.333
Did he do something to you?

30:05.512 --> 30:06.627
Hey, look--

30:06.680 --> 30:08.841
Touch me again,
and I will break your arm.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.676
Just tell me what happened.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.887
- You want to help me?
- Yeah, I do.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.051
Then do your job.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.844
Find her.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.556
Every parent in the state
with a missing kid's out there,

30:56.605 --> 30:58.311
thinking we have
their daughter.

30:58.315 --> 31:01.022
No idea we've got nothing
but bones at this point.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.899
How long till you can ID them?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.900
We're matching
dental records now

31:04.946 --> 31:07.153
for the ones
that have dental records.

31:07.199 --> 31:11.192
Gonna take days, weeks.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.951
Is there any way to tell
if the wounds on this victim

31:17.000 --> 31:18.706
match our current bodies?

31:23.090 --> 31:24.921
I'll owe you.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.257
I don't know.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.591
Still got the body?

31:32.641 --> 31:34.882
No, it was three years ago.
She was cremated.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.471
I have the autopsy report.

31:36.478 --> 31:40.972
You know, there's not much
I can do without the body.

31:41.024 --> 31:46.189
Uh, wounds look similar,
same lateral incisions.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.858
It could be the same weapon.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.402
Best I can give you is maybe.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.317
Did you find any jewelry
on the bodies?

31:54.371 --> 31:56.157
Whatever they had is long gone.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.663
Water must have washed it away.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.915
I'm guessing that they were
at the bottom of that pond

32:00.961 --> 32:02.246
for a long time.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.746
The bone density, levels of
saponification on the bone--

32:05.757 --> 32:09.625
it looks like, uh,
at least three to five years.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.634
But it looks
as if they were killed

32:11.680 --> 32:14.092
within
about a six-month period.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.806
How can you tell?

32:16.852 --> 32:19.685
Biohazard bags
they were dumped in

32:19.729 --> 32:22.311
captured and preserved
the environmental debris.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.894
I won't know for sure
until the tests come back,

32:24.943 --> 32:27.650
but all the material
in all the bags is consistent.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.028
So bodies
couldn't have been dumped

32:30.073 --> 32:31.609
any more than six months apart.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.824
My victim's finger was broken.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.531
The killer took her ring,
I think.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.660
Is there any way to tell

32:37.706 --> 32:39.571
if jewelry was taken
from these bodies?

32:39.624 --> 32:43.458
I got a few broken fingers,
some missing entirely.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.289
Animals got to them?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.293
No.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.502
Killer did.
Sawed them off.

32:49.551 --> 32:52.133
Same weapon used on the throat.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.258
Thank you.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.522
Testifying about DNA evidence.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.478
There wasn't nothing
but two drops

33:07.527 --> 33:09.267
of my B negative in the place.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.734
Hey, kid,
don't you ever shut up?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.488
No. I'm a shark.

33:14.534 --> 33:18.994
Got to keep the water
flowing over my gills.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.997
Hey, kid...

33:22.000 --> 33:26.790
I ever tell you about this riot
back at Cedar Creek?

33:26.838 --> 33:30.330
Becker's cousin
works up there-- Jimmy.

33:30.383 --> 33:34.092
He had a hard-on for me
from the beginning.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.345
So, this riot goes down,

33:37.390 --> 33:39.346
and Jimmy there,
he's got his club out,

33:39.392 --> 33:40.643
and he's acting all hard,

33:40.685 --> 33:43.062
and he's screaming at me
to get down on the floor.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.891
And Ijust walk
right up to him.

33:45.899 --> 33:50.268
And he starts shaking,
pissing himself.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.936
His nose broke real easy,
but his eye--

33:52.989 --> 33:56.777
the sucker was tough.

33:56.826 --> 34:00.114
Dug in tight and slippery.

34:03.959 --> 34:07.417
Six pounds of pressure,
you can rip someone's ear off,

34:07.462 --> 34:09.999
but an eye...

34:10.006 --> 34:11.837
takes dedication.

34:24.646 --> 34:25.886
The whole time,

34:25.939 --> 34:30.603
Jimmy was squealing
like a little stuck bitch.

34:35.365 --> 34:37.902
Prison's a disease.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.284
It gets in your blood.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.913
You pass it to your kids,
and they pass it to their kids.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.916
And soon enough,
Adrian is gonna be here, too.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.878
And you should've
clone him a favor

34:51.923 --> 34:54.460
and slit his throat
just like you did his mom's.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.719
Becker,
they need you in "D."

35:06.771 --> 35:09.262
He got to you, Big Noise.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.390
You let him in.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.270
You're all tough.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.357
Acting like you
don't care about your son.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.275
But you care.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.987
Anyone can see it.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.948
"A" right there.

35:23.997 --> 35:28.036
You got his name on your chest.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.433
How much longer
are we gonna sit on this guy?

35:52.025 --> 35:55.062
Go home if you want.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.103
Let you take all the credit when this
son of a bitch leads us to a body?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.145
No, thanks.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.703
How about cracking a window?

36:07.749 --> 36:09.740
The place smells like
a damn bowling alley.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.172
Eh.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.895
Little bitch blew us up.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.560
Well, without her,
we had nothing, so...

36:38.613 --> 36:40.649
Dispatch, we've been made.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.111
We're handing off to car 957.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.696
Heard you got picked up.

36:46.746 --> 36:49.283
Nah, it wasn't nothing.

36:52.043 --> 36:56.127
Cops found a bunch of dead girls
in some pond.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.548
Yeah.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.172
Maybe you should cool it with
the dates for now, you know?

37:01.428 --> 37:03.919
I can spot you.
My dad sent me some cash.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.087
Oh.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.347
Look at you, rich bitch.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.054
Fine.
Forget it.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.718
Hey.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.060
What happened to your face?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.145
What?

37:18.194 --> 37:19.479
Right there.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.565
- Did someone hit you?
- No.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.529
You should get some ice
for that, B.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.364
I'm serious.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.657
What's up, bitches?

37:33.710 --> 37:37.043
Yo, Jesse got picked up
this morning.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.296
Cops are making mad rounds
'cause of those murders.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.128
Hey, I heard the killer
cut off all their heads,

37:43.178 --> 37:45.794
hung 'em in the tree
like Christmas bells.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.714
I'm going tonight--
where they found them.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.052
You want to come?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.308
And spend the night in jail
with your dumb ass?

37:52.353 --> 37:55.095
- Pass.
- I'll go.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.230
What?
It'll be fun.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.685
No, you'll get arrested,

37:58.735 --> 38:01.977
and then the cops will think
Twitch killed those girls.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.194
Are you scared?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.943
Let's go, bitch.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.610
So, ifI see a snake,
my black ass is running.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.699
We got three
identified girls--

39:30.702 --> 39:34.411
Nicky Velasco, Ashley Kwon,
Sandra Helford.

39:34.455 --> 39:35.865
Any matches with Goldie's porn?

39:35.915 --> 39:37.530
No.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.372
Nicky ran away when she was 15.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.375
Sandra, 16.

39:48.428 --> 39:51.591
Nobody reported them missing
or even noticed they were gone.

39:51.598 --> 39:54.010
Throwaway kids, all of them.

39:54.058 --> 39:56.595
Not Ashley.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.101
She ended up the same place,
though, didn't she?

40:00.273 --> 40:01.683
Where's Reddick?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.644
Punched out.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.312
Get his beauty sleep.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.778
Me, I'm already beautiful,
so...

40:14.454 --> 40:16.194
Talk to Picasso?

40:16.247 --> 40:17.862
I got nothing.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.032
I'm not even sure
he remembered me.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.375
It was a long time ago, Linden.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.129
But he wants to see his dad.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.675
If you thought your dad
murdered your mom,

40:30.720 --> 40:32.426
nearly cut her head off...

40:32.472 --> 40:34.588
would you want to see him?

40:41.147 --> 40:43.263
You'll want to see this.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.852
- We're close.
- Too bad your drag-queen mama

40:48.905 --> 40:50.111
didn't have a yacht to take us.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.244
Are those 9 raves?

41:22.855 --> 41:25.562
Seward?

41:25.608 --> 41:27.599
Seward, get up!

41:27.652 --> 41:28.937
Seward?

41:31.906 --> 41:33.271
Christ.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.110
Code Blue! Code Blue!

41:35.159 --> 41:37.150
What the hell did you do?!
Code Blue!

41:37.203 --> 41:38.318
Open 204!

41:38.371 --> 41:40.783
- Open it now!
- Opening 204.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.281
- Go, go, go, go!
- Code Blue, Code Blue.

41:57.348 --> 42:00.681
So, what's
your favorite subject?

42:00.685 --> 42:03.222
I like reading, I guess.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.977
We got a match.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.891
Are you a virgin?

42:08.901 --> 42:13.770
Come on, now. Why don’t you
take off that shirt?
