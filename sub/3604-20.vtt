you should be asking yourself?

to save Peter?"

Daphne’s alive, Matt!

00:19.520 --> 00:22.307

right now is finding Daphne

You turned me
into a terrorist!

00:26.777 --> 00:28.108
It was Danko.
He's got his own agenda.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.561
MATT: You’re lying to me!

00:29.655 --> 00:31.862
It's from
someone named Rebel.

that Nathan will find

03:46.268 --> 03:47.974
that it serves
his agenda to forgive you.

Of course he will.
But Peter...

He's said his goodbyes.

has thrown Nathan

down to you, Noah.

but there it is.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.989
Danko doesn't trust me.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.123
Then make him trust you.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.836
Get his mind off Nathan.
Give him some kind of
feather to put in his cap.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.709
Give him one of us.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.293
If I were a better woman,
I'd suggest you turn me over.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.174
That would show him
whose side you're on.

What makes you
so sure I haven't?

04:29.854 --> 04:32.766
You need
a bigger feather.
Give him Rebel

04:33.691 --> 04:36.057
and Danko will be
your best friend.

04:36.152 --> 04:40.065

you may be needing

we should let him.

catch Rebel?

AGENT: Move in.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.085
You must've been
a Boy Scout.

32:49.176 --> 32:50.712
What's the
Boy Scout motto?

32:50.803 --> 32:51.918
"Be prepared"?

32:52.012 --> 32:53.593
Yeah. Clearly you
weren't a Boy Scout.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.670
Because I'm a girl?

32:54.765 --> 32:56.096
Because the first
rule of Scout law

32:56.183 --> 32:58.299
is to be trustworthy,
and you suck at that.

32:59.228 --> 33:02.766
I know. I'm not
proud of myself.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.350
I don't
understand you.

33:04.441 --> 33:05.476
You got into
politics to protect

33:05.568 --> 33:07.524
the civil liberties
of the everyday American.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.771
Oh, God.
You read my bio?

33:08.863 --> 33:10.899
I read everything
on you. Okay?

33:11.073 --> 33:12.529
I thought that meant
I knew you.

33:12.616 --> 33:16.279
I thought that because
you look like my mom,
that I knew you.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.320
If I met you earlier
in my political career,

33:19.415 --> 33:21.827
maybe I'd be
more like my bio,

33:22.293 --> 33:26.081
but I'm not that person,
and I'm not your mom.

33:26.881 --> 33:30.169
I know. You're
nothing like her.

33:30.301 --> 33:33.509
My mom, who was
the everyday American,
was a hero.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.052
You're just
a politician.

33:35.139 --> 33:36.549
Who are you?
Che Guevara?

33:36.640 --> 33:37.891
Che Guevara led
a revolution.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.181
This is a rebellion.

33:39.268 --> 33:40.974
So whose side
are you on?

33:41.103 --> 33:42.843
And "mine" is
not an answer.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.527
Can you tell
the sprinklers what to do?

33:59.622 --> 34:01.487
I can tell the fire alarm
to tell the sprinklers
what to do.

34:01.582 --> 34:02.662
Okay.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.538
Then tell them
to make it rain in here.

I can't.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.063
Keep doing what you're
doing, Rebel. Go.

34:29.151 --> 34:32.564
And, Micah,
stay ahead of the ice.

a hell of a cold snap.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.586
Any sign of Rebel?

No.

Don't worry,
Baby Matt Parkman,

37:11.688 --> 37:13.019
you will see
your mother again,

37:13.107 --> 37:14.768
when it's all safe.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.353
Sherbe
very proud of you.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.268
You've been
very brave.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.399
You didn't cry
even once.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.119
But if you want
to cry, it's okay.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.653
If you feel like crying,
you can.

37:30.457 --> 37:33.790
But when time starts again,
you have to be brave.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.293
Yes.

start paying people
for their thoughts?

And, more importantly,
how did you find me?

You love Paris

Don't.

You got here
awfully fast.

How'd you
get here?

How'd you get here?

39:14.603 --> 39:17.640
So you're
Mr. Concorde now?

39:18.899 --> 39:20.855
You read minds.
You don't

39:24.488 --> 39:25.603
fly.

39:27.574 --> 39:30.657
All right.
You are flying.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.782
I didn't know
you could fly.

I didn't know
you could run on water.

except air
and the vacuum
ofspace.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.545
Otherwise, I'd be
living on the moon.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.252
Honey, see that?
We are learning new

39:50.347 --> 39:52.508
and intriguing things
about each other.

39:53.642 --> 39:56.884
That's the kind of thing
you can hang
a relationship on.

39:56.979 --> 39:59.311
Wanna go for a ride?

40:28.176 --> 40:31.339
As high as you wanna go.
You just have to
hold onto me.

40:36.852 --> 40:39.434
You really would do anything
for me, wouldn't you?

40:39.521 --> 40:42.513

Just say the word.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.233
