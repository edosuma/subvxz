...picnics in the park,
dancing in the rain.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.734
And you will take me
to a monster truck rally.

39:02.590 --> 39:06.048
For a guy who just got a mondo dose
of kryptonite, you sure seem happy.

39:09.096 --> 39:12.259
She should be ﬁne.
Dr. Emil ran every test on her...

39:12.433 --> 39:14.924
...and she's healthy
and doesn't remember a thing...

39:15.102 --> 39:17.935
...except, of course,
the ﬂowers Clark sent to her room.

39:18.105 --> 39:22.269
-But who could forget ﬁve dozen roses?
-Five dozen roses? Well, that's subtle.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.235
I don't get
why the two of you are grinning...

39:26.405 --> 39:29.272
...considering we're about to die
terribly tragic deaths...

39:29.450 --> 39:30.940
...in the not-so-distant future.

39:31.118 --> 39:33.860
If we do something in the present,
we can change that.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.494
I vote we take Zod out now.

39:35.664 --> 39:38.280
Doesn't have a chance
to take sunshine off our shoulders.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.450
No. In the future, I tried to ﬁght Zod...

39:40.628 --> 39:42.960
...all I did was turn him
into a powerful enemy.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.167
You learning a lesson in teamwork
doesn't mean we stop ﬁghting Zod.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.425
Going against Zod will force him
to come back with everything.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.586
You think you two can just hug it out?

39:51.972 --> 39:53.963
When my father said, "Save Zod"...

39:54.141 --> 39:56.473
...what I think he meant
was save Zod from himself.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.509
If I befriend him, show how good life—

39:58.729 --> 39:59.969
That would be a mistake.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.264
Clark, if Zod
gets his solar towers online...

40:03.442 --> 40:07.731
...that gives him all the power in the world
and us none. Including you.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.817
Zod will ﬂy psychopathic circles
around you.

40:10.991 --> 40:14.028
Chloe, I've seen what happens
when I treat Zod like the enemy.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.285
This time,
I'm gonna do things the right way.

40:21.460 --> 40:26.671
ZOD:
This tower must be built at all costs.

40:27.007 --> 40:30.135
You, you ﬁnd your way into city hall...

40:30.302 --> 40:33.465
...smooth over any laws
that might get in our way.

40:33.639 --> 40:38.850
You, inﬁltrate the power plant
to divert the energy we need.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.518
And you--

41:01.000 --> 41:03.036
I understand
you've been looking for me.

41:06.672 --> 41:09.004
My brother and sister Kandorians.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.666
He has come.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.180
Kneel before Kal-El.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.528
