00:47.777 --> 00:50.369
General Arsanov, it's Dmitry Petrovich.

00:58.012 --> 00:59.530
What's happening?

00:59.687 --> 01:02.381
American cop tried to stop
truck a few kilometers back.

01:02.383 --> 01:04.434
He shot Musa, but Musa was brave,

01:04.468 --> 01:06.219
kept driving to protect you.

01:06.221 --> 01:08.438
- So why do we stop?
- Cop shot tires.

01:08.473 --> 01:11.524
Musa stopped to fix, but he was too hurt.

01:11.559 --> 01:12.692
He's dead.

01:14.612 --> 01:17.563
And you are not hurt at all, yeah?

01:17.615 --> 01:19.565
I stay behind, shoot cop.

01:19.617 --> 01:21.651
Take his car, catch up to you.

01:21.703 --> 01:24.070
Maybe you are lying.

01:24.122 --> 01:26.289
It's business, General.

01:26.324 --> 01:27.573
Your cargo.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.709
I don't deliver, I don't get paid.

01:29.744 --> 01:31.627
Come on, let's go.

01:32.997 --> 01:35.414
Only room for one in trunk.

01:35.467 --> 01:37.083
Come.

01:37.085 --> 01:39.418
Or I leave you here for police to find you.

02:01.092 --> 02:03.442
I see sign for petrol station,

02:03.444 --> 02:04.660
maybe two kilometer.

02:04.696 --> 02:06.696
Someone will meet you there.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.261
It's all gone to hell.

02:22.297 --> 02:23.596
The package?

02:23.631 --> 02:25.598
I've got it, but you've
got a mess to clean up.

02:25.633 --> 02:26.599
What happened?

02:26.634 --> 02:28.134
Ballard got in the way.

02:28.186 --> 02:29.435
I shot him.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.137
Christ.

02:31.139 --> 02:32.688
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

02:32.724 --> 02:35.191
But you got to send Steve to
pick up Ilyana and the girl.

02:35.226 --> 02:39.111
Petrol station three kilometers
west of Brno on Highway 13.

02:39.147 --> 02:41.280
You just shot an American federal agent.

02:41.316 --> 02:43.232
Everyone in Prague is looking for you.

02:43.284 --> 02:45.651
Complete your mission, deliver the package,

02:45.703 --> 02:48.654
and get yourself to the bloody exfil site.

02:48.706 --> 02:51.490
No, I'm not going anywhere
till I know you have the girls.

02:51.492 --> 02:53.826
Bring them to the safe
house. I'll meet you there.

03:04.263 --> 03:05.380
Curtis!

03:07.435 --> 03:08.174
Curtis!

03:08.226 --> 03:09.559
Oh, my God.

03:09.594 --> 03:10.676
Dmitry...

03:12.997 --> 03:14.146
took my car.

03:14.182 --> 03:16.015
It's all right.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.114
Curtis, stay with me.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.532
Are you with me?

03:33.534 --> 03:35.451
You're going to be okay.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.192
Tamir Zakayev obtained

04:17.247 --> 04:19.245
work visas for three Russian men.

04:19.297 --> 04:21.079
We talked to two of
them, both from Chechnya.

04:21.132 --> 04:22.248
They were clean.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.217
But the third guy, Vahka Baiev,

04:25.253 --> 04:26.585
is still at large.

04:26.587 --> 04:27.753
They all worked at the Rezlev

04:27.805 --> 04:29.588
air conditioning factory in Liber.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.973
Vahka's coworkers say he
didn't speak a word of Russian

04:32.998 --> 04:33.759
or Chechen.

04:33.811 --> 04:36.312
Six weeks after he
started to work, he quit.

04:36.347 --> 04:37.513
No one's seen him since.

04:37.565 --> 04:38.931
Guy doesn't look Russian or Chechen.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.683
He looks Middle Eastern.

04:40.735 --> 04:42.768
I'll share the photo with our
Egyptian and Saudi liaisons,

04:42.820 --> 04:44.520
see if anyone knows him.

05:15.240 --> 05:15.943
Gabi...

05:31.849 --> 05:33.347
You must eat, Katya.

05:33.372 --> 05:35.740
You haven't touched anything for days.

05:36.396 --> 05:38.457
I'd rather starve to death
than marry that old man.

05:41.479 --> 05:42.828
How can you let this happen?

05:48.260 --> 05:50.302
I'm going to tell you a secret.

05:52.555 --> 05:54.306
You will not have to marry him.

05:56.071 --> 05:56.696
What do you mean?

05:56.876 --> 05:57.760
Your Uncle Tamir

05:57.812 --> 06:00.229
will come here from Prague,

06:00.264 --> 06:04.567
but the president will not return.

06:05.030 --> 06:05.901
Ever.

06:48.396 --> 06:50.404
On schedule. Track the signal.

06:50.568 --> 06:52.232
- On it.
- Could be Beslan.

06:52.334 --> 06:53.449
Could be anyone.

06:53.484 --> 06:55.568
Whoever it is doesn't know Tamir is dead.

06:55.620 --> 06:56.819
Got him.

06:56.871 --> 06:59.038
On the move near Republic Square.

06:59.073 --> 07:00.739
Call a police unit to meet us there.

07:45.404 --> 07:47.411
We're looking for a white
male, 20s, with a beard.

07:48.872 --> 07:49.588
What do you got?

07:55.747 --> 07:57.596
He's heading south, moving pretty fast.

07:57.632 --> 07:59.014
- Could be driving.
- He's heading south.

08:00.468 --> 08:01.977
The tram. The tram!

08:02.055 --> 08:03.802
Stop it!

08:22.487 --> 08:23.229
Call the phone.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.106
Come.

09:31.158 --> 09:32.524
We were taken from our home

09:32.576 --> 09:35.326
by that man.

09:35.362 --> 09:36.911
He had gun.

09:36.947 --> 09:38.613
How did you get away from him?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.665
Someone open truck.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.918
There was yelling and shooting.

09:43.954 --> 09:46.204
I'm afraid, so I keep Katya inside with me.

09:46.256 --> 09:48.206
When it's quiet again, we come out.

09:48.258 --> 09:50.875
I see that man is dead, so we run.

09:50.927 --> 09:53.044
This is horrible night.

09:53.096 --> 09:55.430
Can someone take us home please?

10:09.563 --> 10:11.729
We have a problem.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.451
We'll need you to come to the
police station in the morning

10:16.486 --> 10:18.736
to give a full statement.

10:18.738 --> 10:20.155
Of course.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.260
Ilyana.

10:43.814 --> 10:45.480
How are you here?

10:45.515 --> 10:46.904
Wh... where's General Arsanov?

10:48.193 --> 10:51.102
How dare you try to ship me
to Chechnya like piece of meat.

10:51.154 --> 10:53.438
General order it.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.273
I was carrying out his wishes.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.210
Doku would have wanted it.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.575
Doku is dead.

10:57.611 --> 10:59.661
This house belongs to me now.

11:00.389 --> 11:02.163
I want you out by morning.

11:06.536 --> 11:09.321
Great. Thanks.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.586
Fantastic. Okay.

11:13.164 --> 11:16.127
The FBI agent's in critical condition.

11:16.819 --> 11:18.037
Where are Ilyana and Katya?

11:19.397 --> 11:22.383
Czech police found them
before Steve got there.

11:22.435 --> 11:24.046
Detective interviewed
them; they're at home.

11:24.304 --> 11:25.514
I'm gonna get them.

11:26.866 --> 11:27.639
How?

11:27.968 --> 11:29.686
Dmitry!

11:30.227 --> 11:31.776
What happened? Ilyana will tell me nothing.

11:31.811 --> 11:34.229
We were ambushed, by Russians.

11:34.281 --> 11:36.281
Why did you make me transport girls?

11:36.316 --> 11:37.532
Screwed up everything.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.317
Crazy FBI guy looking for them.

11:39.369 --> 11:40.535
I had to shoot him.

11:40.570 --> 11:43.371
I am in big trouble.

11:43.406 --> 11:44.839
I have to leave Prague.

11:45.753 --> 11:46.541
Now.

11:46.576 --> 11:47.659
I need money.

11:47.711 --> 11:48.826
My trucks,

11:48.828 --> 11:50.378
my club... they are yours.

11:50.413 --> 11:51.616
Buy me out. I give you good price,

11:51.665 --> 11:53.498
but I need cash now.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
Let me see how much I have in the safe.

12:06.179 --> 12:07.345
Go to this address.

12:07.347 --> 12:09.430
6:00 this morning.

14:00.691 --> 14:02.343
Welcome to Prague, Mr. President.

14:02.379 --> 14:04.512
I am honored to be at this crucial summit.

14:04.547 --> 14:07.215
The war against terror is a global fight.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.854
Egyptian intelligence just I.D.'d our man.

14:12.889 --> 14:14.389
Real name is Omar Wasem.

14:14.441 --> 14:15.523
He's a bloody bomb maker.

14:15.558 --> 14:17.141
Who works at an air-conditioning factory

14:17.193 --> 14:18.380
that ships units all over Prague.

14:18.412 --> 14:20.478
He could've planted
explosives in any of them.

14:30.185 --> 14:31.083
Hello?

14:31.122 --> 14:32.623
I think Tamir is dead.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.663
What happened?

14:40.633 --> 14:43.334
Tamir found out who killed his brother.

14:43.336 --> 14:45.336
Russian pig called Dmitry.

14:45.338 --> 14:46.838
So Tamir went to kill him.

14:46.890 --> 14:48.556
But Dmitry came after me.

14:48.591 --> 14:52.260
The only way Dmitry is
alive is if he killed Tamir.

14:53.346 --> 14:54.762
My God.

14:54.814 --> 14:56.347
What do we do?

14:56.349 --> 14:57.849
What do we do?

15:00.770 --> 15:04.989
President Arsanov wishes
to marry your cousin Katya.

15:05.483 --> 15:06.407
Katya?

15:06.788 --> 15:07.608
Why?

15:07.660 --> 15:09.610
He will take a second wife.

15:10.374 --> 15:11.612
Like the Prophet.

15:11.664 --> 15:14.665
If Tamir isn't here to protect us,

15:14.701 --> 15:17.251
this will keep us safe.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.504
Make us important people in Chechnya.

15:19.539 --> 15:21.339
Yes, but Arsanov won't be...

15:21.374 --> 15:23.257
Beslan.

15:23.293 --> 15:25.760
Listen to me.

15:25.795 --> 15:29.630
You must keep the president alive.

15:29.682 --> 15:32.600
Those men... they are already
on their way to kill him.

15:32.635 --> 15:34.552
You must stop them.

15:35.605 --> 15:37.605
How?

15:47.284 --> 15:48.900
I need to speak someone in charge.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.432
Yes?

15:57.721 --> 15:58.793
I have information

15:58.828 --> 16:02.246
about a plot to kill the
president of Chechnya.

16:09.146 --> 16:10.813
A list of all the air-conditioning units

16:10.848 --> 16:13.515
the Egyptian may have worked on.

16:14.401 --> 16:15.184
Christ, that's huge.

16:15.186 --> 16:17.019
They ship 50 units per week.

16:22.513 --> 16:23.193
Miskova.

16:33.621 --> 16:36.005
Okay, thank you.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.173
That was Gabi's office.

16:38.209 --> 16:39.898
Beslan's turned himself in.

16:41.882 --> 16:43.132
He can tell us where Kate is.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.597
Get me in to see him.

16:44.632 --> 16:46.186
Well, you're gonna have to wait your turn.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.800
Simon and Gabi are taking a crack at him.

16:47.852 --> 16:49.018
Well, call them back, Nina.

16:49.053 --> 16:51.272
Tell them to ask him about Kate.

16:51.459 --> 16:52.221
Martin, they will.

16:52.223 --> 16:54.023
But apparently, he's got a different story

16:54.058 --> 16:55.347
he wants to tell first.

16:57.121 --> 16:58.560
My uncle Tamir asked me

16:58.562 --> 17:00.195
to help two men, Chechens,

17:00.231 --> 17:01.730
get into the country.

17:01.732 --> 17:03.649
They are workers, he tells me,

17:03.701 --> 17:05.617
coming to Prague to get jobs.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.736
I give them passports, that's all.

17:07.788 --> 17:10.156
But then I hear them talking.

17:11.258 --> 17:14.076
They say they are here
to kill President Arsanov.

17:15.169 --> 17:16.078
He's a great man.

17:16.848 --> 17:18.130
I knew I had to stop this.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.415
You must warn him.

17:31.646 --> 17:33.345
We thought Tamir was
planning a terror attack.

17:33.397 --> 17:34.763
It was actually an assassination.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.098
No, he's trying to get us

17:36.150 --> 17:38.067
to pull security away
from the signing ceremony.

17:38.102 --> 17:39.768
We call in the threat,
the police rush there,

17:39.770 --> 17:41.442
and the bomb goes off someplace else.

17:41.653 --> 17:42.294
Maybe.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.191
But we still have to notify
Arsanov's security team.

17:48.779 --> 17:50.329
Thank you for informing us.

17:50.364 --> 17:52.476
Chechnya is new land of opportunity.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.084
Excuse me, Mr. President.

18:07.414 --> 18:08.630
Excuse me, gentlemen.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.300
I'll let you in on a little secret.

18:11.302 --> 18:13.185
We've been watching you and Tamir

18:13.220 --> 18:15.637
for the last six months.

18:15.639 --> 18:17.960
We know you drove Kate Crawford from Paris.

18:18.242 --> 18:19.257
Where is she?

18:20.406 --> 18:21.777
I don't know.

18:24.281 --> 18:26.442
You're going to prison, Beslan.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.117
President will help me when he knows

18:28.152 --> 18:29.622
I'm the one who saved his life.

18:29.653 --> 18:31.870
Whatever Tamir was
planning, you were in on it.

18:31.906 --> 18:33.455
We'll make sure Arsanov knows that.

18:33.491 --> 18:36.241
He's not going to save you.

18:36.293 --> 18:38.243
He's going to have you killed.

18:40.755 --> 18:42.081
You want to stay alive?

18:43.388 --> 18:44.388
We need details.

18:44.653 --> 18:47.263
Who are these men? What are they planning?

18:47.317 --> 18:48.387
When will it happen?

18:53.344 --> 18:55.894
Tamir asked me to get hotel room for them.

18:57.010 --> 18:57.813
And a vehicle.

18:58.776 --> 18:59.932
Well, what kind of vehicle?

19:15.143 --> 19:16.448
This must be some kind of cover.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.083
For what?

19:18.119 --> 19:19.952
An accident, an emergency.

19:20.004 --> 19:21.954
An ambulance wouldn't be out of place.

19:22.006 --> 19:23.422
The bomb maker could cause

19:23.457 --> 19:25.207
a pretty big emergency, couldn't he?

19:25.259 --> 19:27.259
So an explosion is
supposed to kill Arsanov.

19:27.294 --> 19:29.428
But if it doesn't...

19:29.463 --> 19:32.131
There are two killers waiting
for him in an ambulance

19:32.183 --> 19:34.133
as he evacuates the signing ceremony.

19:34.185 --> 19:36.051
And what if the signing
ceremony is the big diversion,

19:36.103 --> 19:38.270
and they're going to kill
Arsanov somewhere else?

19:38.676 --> 19:39.805
Where, his motorcade?

19:42.348 --> 19:43.275
Or his hotel.

20:52.296 --> 20:55.130
What was your security
protocol for exiting the hotel?

20:55.132 --> 20:56.431
Leave through the loading dock.

20:56.467 --> 20:57.633
But we are already out.

20:58.519 --> 20:59.518
Why are you asking?

20:59.553 --> 21:00.552
Loading dock.

21:46.350 --> 21:47.399
Go.

21:47.434 --> 21:48.350
Go!

21:49.353 --> 21:50.569
Police!

21:50.604 --> 21:53.071
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

23:06.646 --> 23:07.950
Curtis.

23:08.349 --> 23:10.732
It's me. I'm here.

23:12.646 --> 23:13.841
Did you catch him?

23:15.302 --> 23:15.982
Not yet.

23:16.849 --> 23:17.833
But we're looking.

23:21.469 --> 23:23.344
My leg is killing me.

23:28.887 --> 23:32.410
Curtis, the bullet destroyed the bone,

23:33.777 --> 23:35.611
cut through the arteries.

23:37.143 --> 23:38.728
The doctors had no choice.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.731
They had to remove your leg.

23:46.414 --> 23:47.154
No.

23:48.536 --> 23:49.818
No, I can feel it.

24:00.312 --> 24:02.453
They say it's called phantom pain.

24:04.992 --> 24:08.088
I'm... I'm so sorry.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.246
Please leave me alone.

25:02.182 --> 25:04.682
I need to talk to Ilyana. Where is she?

25:15.825 --> 25:17.825
Mrs. Zakayeva?

25:35.861 --> 25:37.031
Dmitry sent me.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.695
Hello, Ilyana.

25:53.529 --> 25:54.895
Katya.

25:54.947 --> 25:55.742
I'm a friend of Dmitry's.

25:55.812 --> 25:57.125
My name's Terrence.

25:58.296 --> 25:59.570
He never mentioned you.

25:59.656 --> 26:01.093
I'm based in London.

26:01.187 --> 26:03.983
He's asked me to help get you there safely.

26:04.319 --> 26:06.045
My company's handling
all of your of travel...

26:06.070 --> 26:07.795
accommodation, passports.

26:07.897 --> 26:08.889
It's all taken care of.

26:18.627 --> 26:19.846
You took care of everything, didn't you?

26:20.487 --> 26:22.530
Passports, the guns, the ambulance?

26:22.835 --> 26:23.818
No, I told you,

26:23.857 --> 26:25.631
- not the guns.
- I'm not done here!

26:26.701 --> 26:28.562
- Where's Kate?!
- Easy!

26:28.597 --> 26:29.513
Huh?

26:29.565 --> 26:30.927
Who are you?

26:30.982 --> 26:35.235
Tell me where she is, or I
swear by Christ, I'll kill you.

26:35.271 --> 26:36.372
Get him off of me!

26:36.997 --> 26:38.239
Let's go get a cup of coffee.

26:42.816 --> 26:45.199
Nobody gives a shit what happens to you.

26:45.488 --> 26:47.394
Now tell me where she is.

26:52.457 --> 26:53.652
Chechnya.

26:54.871 --> 26:56.949
At the president's country house.

27:02.464 --> 27:04.848
But you'll never get her.

27:06.011 --> 27:08.300
She's going to marry the president.

27:25.951 --> 27:26.646
What?

27:26.787 --> 27:27.552
What are they saying?

27:27.638 --> 27:29.927
Someone tried to kill the president.

27:29.974 --> 27:31.482
But he survived, praise Allah.

27:32.747 --> 27:33.919
He's coming home.

27:36.380 --> 27:39.114
Leaving nine dead and 33 wounded.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.778
The cell phone believed to have been used

27:40.803 --> 27:43.098
to detonate the bomb was
found in the gunmen's vehicle,

27:43.278 --> 27:44.457
leading authorities to believe

27:44.676 --> 27:46.434
that the two Chechens acted alone.

28:08.038 --> 28:09.863
Curtis?

28:09.915 --> 28:11.365
What are you doing?

28:13.354 --> 28:14.229
Uh...

28:14.541 --> 28:15.924
It's nothing. Just...

28:23.026 --> 28:24.143
Who's Hanson?

28:28.764 --> 28:31.108
He was my Mormon mission companion

28:31.756 --> 28:32.623
when I was a kid.

28:36.678 --> 28:39.142
He was murdered.

28:42.481 --> 28:43.615
I'm sorry.

28:51.459 --> 28:52.556
It was my fault.

28:53.900 --> 28:58.236
After Hanson died, I made a vow to God

28:59.236 --> 29:03.076
to become a cop and get justice.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.670
Fight the bad guys.

29:08.590 --> 29:11.091
It was a big joke, right?

29:13.442 --> 29:17.184
I think God would understand
if you let Dmitry go.

29:19.068 --> 29:21.251
'Cause if you keep trying to catch him...

29:23.978 --> 29:25.274
it's going to kill you.

29:28.616 --> 29:32.079
And I don't think God would want that.

30:23.335 --> 30:25.020
You need to come home, Agent Ballard.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.671
I'm not going anywhere
until I find Petrovich.

30:27.706 --> 30:29.623
I need more resources, a bigger team...

30:29.625 --> 30:31.291
Have you been watching the news?

30:31.343 --> 30:32.626
Nobody gives a shit about

30:32.678 --> 30:34.761
Russian mobsters anymore, Curtis.

30:45.103 --> 30:46.369
I brought lunch.

30:46.947 --> 30:48.692
An American hamburger place.

30:48.727 --> 30:50.310
Instead of hospital food.

30:50.312 --> 30:52.279
They ordered me back to D.C.

30:53.472 --> 30:54.314
Hmm.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.369
Since when does Agent Curtis Ballard

30:59.404 --> 31:00.898
follow orders?

31:02.155 --> 31:03.952
I have a friend who works at Interpol.

31:04.726 --> 31:05.825
Maybe you could get a job there,

31:05.827 --> 31:07.377
keep looking for Dmitry.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.630
Why do you keep coming here?

31:11.296 --> 31:13.166
Bringing me food, trying to cheer me up.

31:13.218 --> 31:14.668
I don't need your pity.

31:20.918 --> 31:22.475
You really don't get it, do you?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.480
I don't pity you, Curtis.

31:39.361 --> 31:40.164
I like you.

32:00.936 --> 32:02.215
Marry me, Gabi.

32:02.905 --> 32:04.267
What?

32:04.303 --> 32:06.269
I can stay here and get a job.

32:06.305 --> 32:08.221
At Interpol, fine, I don't care.

32:08.223 --> 32:09.805
We can start a family.

32:13.312 --> 32:17.731
Curtis, I said I liked you,
I didn't say I'd marry you.

32:20.702 --> 32:22.569
It's just...

32:25.032 --> 32:27.624
I'm not... I'm not the marrying type.

32:40.255 --> 32:42.722
You said I wouldn't have to marry him.

32:42.867 --> 32:43.922
That I'd never see him again.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.925
Things don't always go as planned.

32:45.977 --> 32:47.977
Now we move forward.

32:51.744 --> 32:53.322
You told me he wasn't coming back.

32:54.963 --> 32:57.049
That means you knew
someone was gonna kill him.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.322
Maybe I should tell him that.

33:03.236 --> 33:04.444
If you do that,

33:05.385 --> 33:08.415
I will tell him that
when Tamir's plan failed,

33:08.953 --> 33:11.055
you offered to kill him
on your wedding night.

33:12.719 --> 33:14.454
- That's ridiculous.
- Really?

33:14.773 --> 33:17.234
Aren't you the terrorist
girl from the Paris attack?

33:21.469 --> 33:22.906
It will be a beautiful wedding.

33:33.776 --> 33:36.476
Arsanov's people are denying any
knowledge of Kate's whereabouts.

33:36.478 --> 33:38.389
He's already in the air,
heading back to Chechnya.

33:40.006 --> 33:41.781
CIA could send an extraction team.

33:41.817 --> 33:43.867
Martin, the U.S. government
is about to sign an agreement

33:43.902 --> 33:46.132
of cooperation on global
terror with the Russians.

33:46.390 --> 33:47.115
You think they're gonna

33:47.140 --> 33:48.488
authorize an armed incursion

33:48.490 --> 33:49.956
into the sovereign territory of an ally?

33:49.991 --> 33:50.953
So that's it, then?

33:51.945 --> 33:54.599
After all the promises,
you're just gonna let her rot?

33:55.755 --> 33:57.247
Been going through that material you got us

33:57.299 --> 33:58.665
off Tamir's computer.

33:59.161 --> 34:00.396
Some interesting stuff.

34:02.091 --> 34:03.253
Money transfers.

34:03.305 --> 34:04.846
From a bank in Moscow.

34:05.721 --> 34:07.724
Encrypted comms from the FSB.

34:07.925 --> 34:09.641
Their puppet Arsanov became a loose Cannon,

34:09.678 --> 34:11.344
so they paid Tamir to take him out,

34:11.396 --> 34:13.170
pin it on Chechen separatists.

34:13.397 --> 34:14.931
They even promised him a big position

34:14.983 --> 34:16.266
in the new Chechen government.

34:16.318 --> 34:18.034
- Oh.
- Someone who needed

34:18.060 --> 34:19.185
to get into Chechnya might be able

34:19.237 --> 34:20.437
to use that information.

34:22.774 --> 34:24.524
I got to run out for a bit.

34:24.576 --> 34:26.609
Cleaning team will be
here in about ten minutes

34:26.661 --> 34:28.661
to shred the files.

34:44.989 --> 34:46.346
I'm going to Chechnya

34:46.380 --> 34:47.964
to bring Kate home.

34:48.016 --> 34:50.266
Why are you doing this?

34:50.302 --> 34:52.170
She's not your daughter.

34:53.722 --> 34:55.722
You don't even remember her.

34:58.354 --> 34:59.692
You don't remember any of it.

35:01.897 --> 35:03.897
I remember little things.

35:07.658 --> 35:08.736
Kate on a swing.

35:10.181 --> 35:11.654
The feeling of home.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.790
When I'm with her and you...

35:19.790 --> 35:20.876
I feel it again.

35:31.513 --> 35:32.683
Ilyana.

35:34.855 --> 35:35.929
It's all right.

35:35.931 --> 35:38.097
I can't be who you want me to be.

35:38.099 --> 35:39.293
I never was.

35:41.434 --> 35:42.676
Didn't you love me?

35:44.605 --> 35:45.905
Very much.

35:47.137 --> 35:48.078
And now?

35:51.906 --> 35:52.945
You have a husband.

35:53.898 --> 35:54.734
Children.

35:57.505 --> 35:58.552
Go back to London.

36:00.208 --> 36:00.954
Be with them.

36:06.161 --> 36:07.710
Please bring Kate back to me.

36:26.755 --> 36:28.114
My name is Martin Odum.

36:28.149 --> 36:29.732
I worked for British
and American intelligence

36:29.784 --> 36:31.618
for more than a decade.

36:31.653 --> 36:34.954
I have top secret information
for your chief of directorate.

36:36.490 --> 36:38.708
I'm guessing he'll want to talk to me.

37:02.451 --> 37:04.146
I know it looks a little cold,

37:04.295 --> 37:06.076
but, uh, once we get some furniture in here

37:06.263 --> 37:09.076
and flowers in the window boxes,
it'll be... it'll be quite cozy.

37:12.028 --> 37:13.286
Dmitry!

37:13.311 --> 37:16.497
Hey!

37:22.605 --> 37:23.527
Welcome home.

37:31.931 --> 37:33.115
You're going home?

37:34.651 --> 37:36.604
I can't stay here, Gabi.

37:36.643 --> 37:38.729
I have to let Petrovich go.

37:42.175 --> 37:43.424
You know, my boss was right.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.478
Nobody cares about
Russian mobsters anymore.

37:46.513 --> 37:48.513
There's a bigger threat now.

37:51.401 --> 37:53.401
I have a duty to my country.

37:55.939 --> 37:58.073
Is this because of duty to your country

37:58.108 --> 38:00.442
or because I said I wouldn't get married?

38:05.857 --> 38:07.380
We're too different, Gabi.

38:09.119 --> 38:10.585
Curtis.

38:15.292 --> 38:16.783
I'll miss my flight.

38:21.231 --> 38:22.302
Good-bye, Gabi.

40:12.325 --> 40:15.460
I'm told you have some information

40:15.495 --> 40:18.129
you'd like to share with us.

40:21.718 --> 40:25.637
I have proof linking
Russian security services

40:25.672 --> 40:28.377
to the assassination plot against Arsanov.

40:29.245 --> 40:32.343
These show Tamir Zakayev

40:32.396 --> 40:35.764
received multiple payments
from accounts traced to the FSB.

40:35.816 --> 40:37.386
One of three copies.

40:37.941 --> 40:40.332
Anything happens to me,
press get the other two.

40:41.496 --> 40:43.271
So...

40:43.323 --> 40:45.323
what do you want?

40:47.381 --> 40:48.959
A girl named Kate Crawford

40:48.990 --> 40:51.045
is being held against her will by Arsanov.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.615
I want your people to help me

40:53.667 --> 40:56.454
get her out of Chechnya,
so I can get her back home.

40:57.946 --> 41:00.288
You really don't remember me, do you?

41:05.115 --> 41:08.756
You and I have a long history together...

41:09.529 --> 41:11.382
Alexei.

41:18.772 --> 41:20.475
Welcome back, comrade.
