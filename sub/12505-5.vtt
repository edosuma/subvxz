[Emily] Previously
on Make It or Break It:

00:07.775 --> 00:09.744
- Do I really have you?
- Yes.

00:09.776 --> 00:13.680
Promise rings. We've promise
focus on nothing but gymnastics

00:13.715 --> 00:16.384
and forsake the biggest
distraction of all: boys.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.019
What is Austin Tucker
doing here?

00:19.053 --> 00:20.688
I'm training
at The Rock now.

00:20.722 --> 00:23.691
- I can do the Roundoff Arabian.
- It favors tiny girls.

00:23.725 --> 00:26.194
Genji is at least
ten pounds lighter than you.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.662
You can be more
of an artistic gymnast.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.998
If that's your plan,
then it's over for me.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.701
- [Alex] We are going to file.
- Just wait six months!

00:33.735 --> 00:35.703
- All right.
- [Alex] Six months.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.608
[Tokyo Police Club:

00:43.745 --> 00:46.381
* Oh, give us your vote

00:46.413 --> 00:48.216
* Give us your vote

00:48.249 --> 00:51.786

what's good for you *

00:51.819 --> 00:54.521
* Oh, give us your vote

00:54.555 --> 00:56.356
* Give us your vote

00:56.391 --> 01:00.060
* If you know
what's good for you **

01:03.330 --> 01:07.067
- Hey, champ.
Still chasing Genji, huh?
- Yep.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.736
And I'm not stopping
till she's chasing me.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.641
Guess you got tired of that
hotel coffee

01:13.675 --> 01:16.410
and came by for some
of mom's good stuff?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.780
Actually, just came by
to pick up a couple of things

01:18.813 --> 01:20.448
for my new apartment.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.751
What? What's wrong
with the guest house?

01:23.785 --> 01:26.387
I know your mother and I agreed
not to file the divorce papers

01:26.420 --> 01:28.389
for another six months,
but it's really best

01:28.422 --> 01:30.058
that I have my own place.
Don't worry, though.

01:30.090 --> 01:34.295
It's like two minutes away
and I already made
you your own set of keys.

01:34.329 --> 01:37.198
But you're still coming
to The Rock though, right?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.699
We're planning our
new floor routines today

01:38.733 --> 01:39.734
for World Team tryouts.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.369
This is your mother's
day at the gym.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.304
But I need your feedback.

01:43.338 --> 01:45.673
Your mother will do fine.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.542
I'll see you later.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.847
Dad, wait! Um...

01:52.880 --> 01:56.617
You know,
I've been thinking and, um,

01:56.650 --> 02:01.555
I've decided I want you
to be my manager again.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.325
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

02:04.359 --> 02:06.593
Look, I know we used
to fight

02:06.628 --> 02:08.562
about how hard
you used to push me.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.398
Well, now I'm pushing
myself just as hard.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.202
And I figured who better
to manage my career

02:14.234 --> 02:17.738
than someone who shares
my drive and my dream?

02:17.772 --> 02:18.706
[whispers] OK.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.475
Alex. I didn't
know you were here.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.744
Uh, I stopped by to grab
a couple of things,

02:23.778 --> 02:25.380
but I'm glad I did.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.717
- Kaylie has asked me
to be her manager again.
- She what?

02:31.252 --> 02:35.689
So, you two together again.
Back at the gym.

02:35.723 --> 02:39.427
Well, that's not all. Um...

02:39.459 --> 02:44.732
- I've decided I want you
to be my manager, too.
- Really?

02:44.765 --> 02:48.369
Yeah. Dad can take care
of the sports side of things

02:48.403 --> 02:51.672
- and, Mom, you can
handle my PR.
- [chuckles]

02:51.705 --> 02:53.774
You were in showbiz,
you know all about media

02:53.808 --> 02:55.877
and the spotlight.
It's perfect.

02:55.910 --> 02:58.712
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

03:01.948 --> 03:05.219
[rock music plays]

03:05.253 --> 03:06.653
[lips smacking]

03:14.961 --> 03:16.931
What's wrong?

03:16.963 --> 03:19.199
Is our whole relationship
just about sex?

03:19.767 --> 03:22.469
No. It's about safe sex.

03:26.973 --> 03:31.446
- What? I was kidding.
- I wasn't.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.348
How do I know you're not
just with me just because I'm...

03:34.382 --> 03:37.919
- ...willing?
- You know I'm not
that kind of guy.

03:37.952 --> 03:41.688
You used to shower Kaylie
with roses and important gifts

03:41.722 --> 03:43.724
like your mom's necklace
all the time.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.794
I was with Kaylie
for over a year.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.963
But I'm risking
so much to be with you!

03:48.996 --> 03:50.798
I'm constantly lying
to my dad.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.632
I've lost Kaylie
as my best friend.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.736
And she practically treats
me like the gym tramp.

03:55.769 --> 04:00.240
Of course, it'd all be worth
it if I knew that you...

04:02.310 --> 04:04.778
I...

04:04.812 --> 04:06.713
I care a lot
about you, Lauren.

04:06.748 --> 04:09.617
OK, that tells me you'd be
upset if I got hit by a bus.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.819
But it doesn't make
me feel any better. I...

04:11.853 --> 04:13.587
I need to hear you say it.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.823
I don't want to say it just
because you wanna hear it.

04:15.857 --> 04:20.695
- Why not?
- Because I take
love very seriously.

04:20.727 --> 04:23.231
Well, it's good to know
you take love seriously,

04:23.263 --> 04:27.267
but it's obvious you don't
take us very seriously.

04:36.611 --> 04:38.812
[rock music continues]

04:44.986 --> 04:49.023
Look who decided
to bring his latest
one-night stand to the gym.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.591
Shall we take bets
on who the bimbo du jour is?

04:51.626 --> 04:55.062
Probably some model-slash-
actress-slash-pole-dancer.

05:20.755 --> 05:21.756
[music stops]

05:46.947 --> 05:48.983
[rock music plays]

05:55.889 --> 05:58.025
We got a flat.
He happened to ride by

05:58.059 --> 05:59.026
and I didn't want to be late.

05:59.060 --> 06:02.529
So you flagged him down,
jumped on his ego-cycle

06:02.563 --> 06:04.632
and wrapped your arms
around his rock-hard abs?

06:04.664 --> 06:06.833
Someone sounds
a little jealous.

06:06.868 --> 06:09.003
I just don't want us
to forget our promise.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.440
We are focusing
on the gold and not paying
so much attention to boys.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.775
And I just find it
a little suspicious

06:14.808 --> 06:16.444
that Austin always
seems to show up

06:16.477 --> 06:17.812
whenever Emily's in trouble.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.947
You know, paying
attention to boys

06:19.980 --> 06:21.781
because they're paying
attention to other girls

06:21.816 --> 06:24.418
is still paying
attention to boys.

06:24.452 --> 06:27.688
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but Lauren actually
has a valid point.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.891
You guys should be talking
about your new floor routines.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.858
Tryouts for the World Team
are coming up.

06:31.893 --> 06:34.861
Oh, my God. I totally
forgot we were starting
work on our new floors today.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.399
I guess you have more
important things to do,
like, oh, I don't know, Carter?

06:39.433 --> 06:41.001
[scoffs]

06:41.035 --> 06:44.639
OK, girls. The National
Committee is two months away

06:44.672 --> 06:46.006
from choosing the team
that goes to Worlds.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.943
Kaylie, Lauren, Emily,
you must make that cut.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.012
Your new floor routines
have to be perfect by then.

06:52.046 --> 06:54.649
Where do you think you're going?

06:54.682 --> 06:56.783
I thought you were just working
with the National Team members.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.053
I'm working
with future Olympians,
and that includes you.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.922
You still think
that's possible?

07:01.956 --> 07:05.026
Whether it's possible
or not is entirely dependent
on how willing you are.

07:07.028 --> 07:08.695
The dance portions
of your floor

07:08.729 --> 07:10.597
are as important
as the acrobatics.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.968
A triple turn into a Popa can
score higher than a double pike.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.437
So these next few days are all
about isolating and nailing

07:17.471 --> 07:18.972
the dance elements
of your new routines.

07:19.006 --> 07:21.008
Tarah and I will help
you create a presentation

07:21.041 --> 07:23.611
using only your dance elements.
No tumbling.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.979
You will then perform them
for the whole gym on Friday.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.816
Payson, I'm working
with you first.

07:36.724 --> 07:40.795
Um... this is where you'll
start your new routine.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.431
Actually, I always
start in the corner with
a strong tumbling pass.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.865
Bam, you know?
It puts me right in the action.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.536
Yeah, a power gymnast
always starts in the corner.
But from this day forward,

07:48.569 --> 07:50.705
I want you to think
like an artistic gymnast.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.039
And that means starting
in the center.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.175
It's a new beginning
for you, Payson,

07:54.208 --> 07:57.044
and this is where it starts.

08:07.989 --> 08:10.590
She's gonna
need a lyrical opening.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.027
Her first pose should be
low and close to the mat.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.160
Then kneeling and shifting

08:14.195 --> 08:16.864
into a body roll-up
and a sisonne,

08:16.896 --> 08:19.567
finally opening,
arms out, chin back.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.869
Like a flower blooming
for the first time.

08:21.901 --> 08:25.239
- I'm gonna be a flower?
- It's not just about
tumbling anymore, Payson.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.208
You're telling a story.
Making a statement.

08:27.241 --> 08:30.678
And that statement is...
that I'm a flower?

08:30.710 --> 08:32.946
You're telling the world
that you are an entirely

08:32.979 --> 08:34.682
different gymnast
than you used to be.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.251
Beautiful. Graceful.
Artistic.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.656
[sighs]

08:48.095 --> 08:49.896
What's the, uh, emergency?

08:49.929 --> 08:52.532
I totally forgot
that we're starting work
on our new floor routines.

08:52.566 --> 08:56.002
I need to hire
a star choreographer.
And I want Lacey Grimes.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.605
Well, she is the best.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.939
I'll find her number
and give her a buzz.

08:59.973 --> 09:04.044
I actually want to speak
to her personally and
tell her exactly what I want.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.047
Thank you, Daddy.
[laughs]

09:09.016 --> 09:11.317
[cell phone beeping]

09:17.058 --> 09:18.626
That was nice.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.228
I needed a little sugar
after the morning I've had.

09:21.262 --> 09:24.632
- How about another spoonful?
- [laughs]

09:26.934 --> 09:28.669
[sighs] Oh...

09:28.701 --> 09:32.172
This must be how Satan amuses
himself in his free time.

09:32.206 --> 09:36.176
I guess Kaylie
didn't tell you?

09:36.210 --> 09:39.112
- Steve and I are dating.
- Of course you are.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.817
You know,
I saw Alex's car out front.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.252
Is that a sign that the two
of you are working things out?

09:45.286 --> 09:48.689
No, no. But we're going
to be working together,

09:48.722 --> 09:53.960
- co-managing Kaylie.
- Oh! [laughs]
Good luck with that.

09:53.993 --> 09:57.063
And good luck with... this.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.237
You know, I should be
doing more to manage Emily.

10:04.270 --> 10:08.909
- Why not?
- You know, Steve, you do
a lot for Lauren, right?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.245
Do you have any advice
on where I can start?

10:11.277 --> 10:14.747
Well, the girls are working
on new floor routines this week.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.984
A lot of elite gymnasts
hire choreographers

10:17.016 --> 10:18.119
to give them an edge.
You could...

10:18.151 --> 10:20.988
Perfect! Oh!

10:23.858 --> 10:28.027
I've only put together
one elite-level floor
routine in my entire career.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.264
I don't even know
where to start.

10:30.297 --> 10:34.869
Sasha wants me to start
in the center of the mat and
bloom like a friggin' flower.

10:34.902 --> 10:39.974
Tarah had me in the annex doing
boring ballet barre all day.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.309
Hey, ladies. I was
watching your new moves

10:42.343 --> 10:45.078
and I have two words
of advice:

10:45.111 --> 10:47.982
- Jazz hands!
- [laughing]

10:51.117 --> 10:53.721
[mocking] Jazz hands.
Moron.

10:53.754 --> 10:57.358
- He was just teasing.
- No. There's a difference

10:57.391 --> 10:58.958
between teasing and flirting,

10:58.993 --> 11:00.660
and he's definitely
flirting with you, Em.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.962
Payson, back me up here.

11:01.996 --> 11:04.964
No. I'm not paying
attention to boys.

11:06.433 --> 11:10.905
Big news! I've decided
to become Emily's manager.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.974
And I'm starting by getting
her a kick-ass choreographer.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.644
So I called all my
friends in Las Vegas.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.646
Finally one of them told me
she thought I was looking for

11:18.678 --> 11:21.315
the wrong kind of choreographer.
So can you please tell me

11:21.348 --> 11:23.950
who's currently topping
gymnastics "it" list?

11:23.984 --> 11:26.320
Lacey Grimes is pretty hot
at the moment.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.324
Excellent! Now how do I get in
touch with this Lacey Grimes?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.126
[phone rings]

11:35.896 --> 11:37.130
[horn honks]

11:41.435 --> 11:43.270
Thank you for the flowers.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.072
I know it doesn't change
anything I said this morning.

11:46.105 --> 11:50.911
- Or what you didn't say.
- I'm still not ready
to go there with you.

11:50.945 --> 11:53.347
Then I gotta go. I have
to call my new choreographer.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.083
Wait! Hear me out.

11:57.116 --> 12:00.720
Maybe the trouble
is we started our
relationship with sex.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.958
We skipped the romance and
jumped right into the bed.

12:05.159 --> 12:08.394
Then let's do the romance now.
Let's go on a date right now.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.763
We can pick up some yummy stuff
at Turner's Market,

12:10.798 --> 12:15.436
drive up to Boulder Peak
and have a romantic picnic
while we watch the sunset.

12:15.469 --> 12:18.973
No sex. Just romance.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.474
That works for me.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.243
[laughs]

12:43.097 --> 12:46.165
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12:46.199 --> 12:49.168
How long have
you had your license?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.846
You wanna make them jealous?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.780
Your game isn't working on me.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.983
You can't blame
a guy for trying.

13:03.017 --> 13:06.754
Sasha can.
Gym rules, no dating.
So stay away from me.

13:06.786 --> 13:11.924
And Emily. Or you'll

can say "jazz hands."

13:30.110 --> 13:31.845
Listen to this!

13:31.879 --> 13:34.048
I called my A&R guy
at the old label,

13:34.081 --> 13:36.150
and he picked out a song
for your new floor routine.

13:36.182 --> 13:39.252
If you like it, of course.

13:39.285 --> 13:42.355
- I love it!
- It's, uh... It's different.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.391
Right? Don't make
your decision yet.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.160
It's got this great bass hook.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.462
- Wait for it. wait for it.
- [music playing in background]

13:48.495 --> 13:51.965
- [bass playing]
- Isn't it great?

13:51.999 --> 13:54.133
Nobody has heard it, either.
It's completely new.

13:54.168 --> 13:59.973
- Did you run it by Dad?
- I wanted to talk
to you about it first.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.252
I worked all day yesterday
with The Rock's choreographer

14:12.285 --> 14:14.053
and I still feel
like The Blob.

14:14.088 --> 14:17.091
Well, you can kiss your
worries goodbye, darlin',

14:17.123 --> 14:20.326
because Mama has
hired Lacey Grimes!

14:20.361 --> 14:23.364
The hottest gymnastics
choreographer available.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.399
And she's gonna be working
exclusively with Emily Kmetko.

14:26.433 --> 14:30.336
And how much
is that going to cost?

14:30.371 --> 14:33.473
- Two thousand bucks.
- Two thousand dollars?!

14:33.507 --> 14:36.309
No! Absolutely not!
We cannot afford that!

14:36.342 --> 14:39.178
Honey, it's too late. Lacey's
gonna be here this morning.

14:39.213 --> 14:42.315
I cannot believe you didn't
even talk to me about this.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.852
Honey, I just wanted
to surprise you.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.420
Well I have a surprise
for Lacey Grimes.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.958
The moment she gets here,
I'm sending her away.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.395
Phew!

14:56.329 --> 14:58.898
Tickets! Fun! What for?

15:03.237 --> 15:06.372
Obelisk Contemporary
Ballet Theater presents
Flight Of The Swan.

15:06.407 --> 15:08.642
I swear I wasn't snooping.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.513
I was just organizing
Sasha's desk and I found them.

15:12.546 --> 15:15.382
- Two tickets.
- You know what that means.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.185
- It means nothing.
- Come on. Fess up.

15:19.219 --> 15:24.091
OK, I admit I did wonder
if one of them might be for me.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.894
A-ha! You do want
to go out with Sasha.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.329
Just because I want to
doesn't mean it's a good idea.

15:30.364 --> 15:34.134
Oh! What am I doing?
The ballet is tonight.

15:34.168 --> 15:36.402
He would have said
something by now.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.906
Maybe he needs a little push.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.074
Maybe you should
drop a few hints.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.976
That's not really my style.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.385
[soft piano music plays]

15:58.192 --> 15:59.392
[sighs]

16:08.168 --> 16:09.402
[laughs]

16:09.436 --> 16:11.205
What's the problem?

16:11.237 --> 16:13.574
I'm sorry, I'm just not
built to bloom like a flower.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.509
What ever happened
to willingness?

16:15.542 --> 16:18.412
I'm an athlete,
not a ballerina.

16:18.444 --> 16:22.149
Believe me, I know what
ballerinas look like,
and I'm not that type of girl.

16:23.484 --> 16:25.552
Fine. Take five.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.293
I guess the ballet
isn't for everyone.

16:34.328 --> 16:37.164
I happen to love it.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.298
Yeah, me too.

16:39.333 --> 16:43.704
I mean, going out,
getting dressed up,
supporting the arts.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.373
Totally my thing.
It's hard to find someone

16:47.406 --> 16:49.509
who's into that sort of thing
as much as I am.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.045
And I hate going alone,
don't you?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.014
It really
doesn't bother me.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.020
Well, back to worky.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.693
[rock music plays]

17:20.306 --> 17:22.009
What's with
this trashy music?

17:22.041 --> 17:25.444
For your information,
this trash was produced
by a five-time Grammy nominee.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.148
This is not American Idol.
Kaylie's a champion,

17:28.180 --> 17:30.350
she needs something
more classical and majestic.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.618
Hello, I'm the one
who had a hit single.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.353
I think I know a little more
about music than you do.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.290
I thought you were in charge of
the image and PR side of things.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.659
Music is part of Kaylie's image.
Besides, she loves this.

17:39.693 --> 17:42.129
We're co-managers, OK?
That means I get a say in this.

17:42.162 --> 17:46.033
We'll have a business dinner
tonight, all right,
and let Kaylie decide.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.168
Fine. As long as you promise
to keep it professional

17:48.201 --> 17:49.569
and not play the
"Mother knows best" card.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.706
And you better not get
all macho and try
bullying her into a corner.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.674
Let Kaylie decide then.

17:59.780 --> 18:02.416
So how's the parent trap
working out?

18:02.449 --> 18:04.451
So far, so bad.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.054
You girls up
for a party tonight?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.355
A friend of mine's spinning at a
house party in University Hill.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.425
No, we aren't up for a party.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.566
- What are you doing?
- Looking for strings.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.436
You know, since Kaylie seems
to be your puppet master.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.773
Oh, please, stop,
you are so funny.

18:30.744 --> 18:33.579
[sighs] I noticed you two
chatting up Austin.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.416
Do those promise rings lose
their mystical powers when you
take them off to work out?

18:37.451 --> 18:42.389
- We weren't chatting him up.
- I'm happy to not be a member
of your "No Boys Club."

18:42.421 --> 18:45.591
If I were, I couldn't
have had such a good time
with Carter last night.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.662
Oh, good! Looks like the only
floor routine you're working on
has you on your back.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.465
Actually, it wasn't
about sex, Kaylie.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.101
It was just
a very romantic date.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.435
A sunset picnic at Boulder Peak.

18:56.470 --> 19:00.506
As for my floor routine, I just
left a message for Lacey Grimes.

19:00.539 --> 19:04.443
- Lacey Grimes?
- [Lauren] You probably wouldn't
have heard of her, Emily.

19:04.478 --> 19:06.846
She only works with serious
Olympic hopefuls.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.349
I doubt you would've run
into her at the YMCA.
Look at that.

19:10.384 --> 19:11.817
She must've gotten my message
and come right away.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.556
Hi, Ms. Grimes. I'm Lauren.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.425
It's nice to meet you, Lauren.
I'm looking for Emily.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.360
What?

19:22.561 --> 19:25.799
- I'm Emily.
- Hi.

19:25.832 --> 19:30.404
You're working with her?
I'm the one who called
you this morning.

19:30.436 --> 19:33.373
And Emily's mother
called me last night.

19:33.407 --> 19:35.809
I've checked out your footage
on the National Gymnastic site.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.912
I think we can really
step up your game.
Are you ready to work?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.650
You bet I am.

19:53.793 --> 19:57.864
OK, with a lot of energy.
Five, six, seven,
and a one.

19:57.898 --> 20:01.168
Reach, point your toes.
Thank you. Up and one.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.803
Two, up, and one,

20:02.835 --> 20:05.639
two, three, four.
Lots of energy.

20:05.671 --> 20:09.642
Six, both arms,
and step, drag, chasse this way.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.244
Flip kick, step, step.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.547
And double... stop.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.451
[scoffs] Just stop.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.419
You haven't really
studied dance, have you?

20:20.454 --> 20:22.923
I've taken some classes
here and there.

20:22.956 --> 20:26.759
- At Gymboree?
- I'm better than this, I am.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.762
And I can do the flip kick turn,
but I keep blowing...

20:29.796 --> 20:32.765
The one-and-a-half
that comes after.
Yeah, I can see that.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.468
Anyone with eyes can see that.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.804
It's just that...

20:37.837 --> 20:40.874
...your style, your technique,

20:40.907 --> 20:44.643
- it's definitely new to me.
- That's not the problem.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.214
You're blocked.
And I will do what I can,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.849
but you may have
to be here all night

20:49.883 --> 20:51.284
if you want to nail
this by tomorrow.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.256
Let's do it again,
from the top.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.927
Five, six, seven,
and arm, lunge.

21:00.961 --> 21:04.231
And up and down,
the leg and up.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.400
And one, cross, look up.

21:07.433 --> 21:11.270
- And energy, two arms...
- Look at her spazzing out.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.907
- I could do this routine
in my sleep.
- Lauren, be nice.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.644
Nice?
She stole my choreographer!

21:17.676 --> 21:19.846
How did Chloe even know
to hire a choreographer?

21:22.516 --> 21:23.816
OMG!

21:23.850 --> 21:25.484
You told Chloe
to hire Lacey Grimes!

21:25.519 --> 21:28.420
I never said anything
about Lacey Grimes.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.889
But you did tell her
to get a choreographer?

21:29.923 --> 21:31.891
And I told you
to call Lacey right away.

21:31.925 --> 21:34.827
What were you doing last night
that you couldn't call her?

21:34.861 --> 21:37.797
Studying.
But this is ridiculous.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.399
You're helping my competition.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.337
Daddy, please promise me you
won't help Emily anymore.

21:47.007 --> 21:49.876
So much for the hint dropping.

21:49.909 --> 21:53.413
He's not going to ask you out
in the middle of the gym.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.382
He's not taking me
to the ballet.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.050
I think he's gonna come
in that door any moment

21:57.083 --> 22:00.820
and ask you out in his typically
blunt, adorable Sasha fashion.

22:02.622 --> 22:06.492
Oh, uh, Summer, uh...
Are you free tonight?

22:07.894 --> 22:10.897
Oh, um... Well...

22:10.931 --> 22:13.999
I mean, it's kind of
last minute, but, um...

22:14.034 --> 22:18.537
- I am free tonight, actually.
- Excellent.

22:18.572 --> 22:22.075
It's just that I need you
to baby-sit the gym,
if you don't mind.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.846
Emily needs to stay late
and work on her new
Lacey Grimes choreography.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.848
- Kim.
- Yes?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.917
I've got two tickets
to the ballet tonight.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.453
And, um...

22:33.486 --> 22:36.590
I'd like to take Payson,
if that's OK with you.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.891
I think a little inspiration
might be just what
she needs now.

22:38.925 --> 22:42.095
Yes, sure.
It's a nice idea.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.563
OK.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.434
I'm so sorry.

22:52.072 --> 22:53.906
I don't know why Sasha's
making me do this.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.375
It's not like I've never
been to a ballet before.

22:56.409 --> 23:00.013
Dad used to take Becca
and me every year to go see
Nutcracker at Christmas.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.815
Well, this is a
contemporary ballet.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.484
This is a touring company
out of New York.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.787
It's not your typical
civic center kind of thing.

23:07.821 --> 23:10.090
Whatever. It's not
gonna make a difference. Mom!

23:10.123 --> 23:13.893
Sasha's trying to make me
do something that I'll never
be able to pull off.

23:13.927 --> 23:17.062
Girls like Kaylie can just
flash cutesy smiles
and do dance elements

23:17.097 --> 23:20.866
and everybody goes ga-ga because
they're so petite and graceful.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.836
- [laughs]
- [doorbell rings]

23:22.868 --> 23:26.805
There he is. OK, promise me
you'll keep an open mind

23:26.840 --> 23:28.874
and try to enjoy the show.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.979
The only thing I can promise you
is that I'll show up.
Not to enjoy it.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.453
[Kim] Look who's here.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.924
Wow! You look...

23:44.957 --> 23:47.927
- Very dashing.
- Well, I give all the credit

23:47.960 --> 23:51.398
- to JK Lenmar and Sons.
- [Kim laughs]

23:51.430 --> 23:53.700
Payson Keeler,
your carriage awaits.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.916
[Alex] Kaylie is
representing the USA now,
not promoting a night club.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.686
- I think she should
find something more...
- Old-fashioned?

24:12.718 --> 24:15.654
Kaylie is an American classic
and should use an
American classic

24:15.689 --> 24:18.091
- like Gershwin or Copland.
- That'll put everyone to sleep.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.694
- You have no what
you're talking about.
- Are we at this again?

24:20.726 --> 24:23.430
Kaylie, honey,
what do you think?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.998
Yeah, sweetheart,
which music do you want to use?

24:27.767 --> 24:33.640
Uh... Maybe we can
blend both styles together.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.576
Maybe mom's friend
could create a piece

24:36.609 --> 24:38.911
using the classical music
you think I need,

24:38.944 --> 24:42.948
but mixed with a beat with
a modern edge like Mom wants.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.053
It's called compromise, Alex.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.056
Kaylie, honey,
you've barely touched your food.

24:50.089 --> 24:53.660
[Alex] OK, but if your music biz
friends create some mix,
I need to sign off on it.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.695
- [silverware clatters]
- [Ronnie] Calm down.

24:55.729 --> 24:58.198
We're not out
to sabotage you.

24:58.231 --> 25:00.866
- [Alex] I really don't
think you know...
- [Ronnie] Deep breaths.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.768
- [Alex] Don't tell me
to calm down.
- [Ronnie] Deep breaths.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.070
[Alex] Or deep breaths
or any of that stuff...

25:04.104 --> 25:06.139
[car honking]

25:06.171 --> 25:08.507
So, what is this
Flight of the Swan?

25:08.541 --> 25:11.777
A modern interpretation of
the classic ballet Swan Lake.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.480
Nudge me if I fall asleep.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.014
You know, I have been
to a ballet before.

25:15.048 --> 25:16.916
My dad used to take me all
the time when I was little.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.485
And? Did you like it?

25:18.517 --> 25:22.155
I only enjoyed the part
where I got to drink
sparkling apple cider

25:22.188 --> 25:24.591
out of plastic
champagne glasses.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.526
- [woman] Belov! Hi.
- Hey!

25:27.560 --> 25:29.061
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good. You?

25:29.095 --> 25:31.164
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Jayden, this is Payson.

25:31.197 --> 25:35.134
Hi, nice to meet you.
You're one of Sasha's
champions, huh?

25:35.168 --> 25:37.002
Well, I'm one of his gymnasts.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.937
Hey, look, thanks
for the last-minute tickets.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.673
Oh, yeah.
Happy to do it.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.776
I've got to get backstage
and get this show started.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.177
But it was great
to meet you, Payson.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.812
- Nice to meet you, too.
- See you after.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.680
OK, bye.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.948
So, what is she,
the stage manager?

25:49.982 --> 25:52.285
What do you say we go inside,

25:52.318 --> 25:56.122
down a couple of sparkling
ciders out of plastic champagne
flutes and enjoy the ballet?

25:56.155 --> 25:59.558
How about we down the ciders
and skip the ballet?

25:59.592 --> 26:01.026
Yeah, nice try.

[dance music plays]

26:05.864 --> 26:08.701
* Yeah

26:08.734 --> 26:10.602
* She's too hot to handle

26:10.637 --> 26:13.005
* Yeah, that girl's
like dynamite *

26:13.039 --> 26:16.909
* She's got moves, yeah

26:18.043 --> 26:19.746
* She's got superpowers

26:19.778 --> 26:22.915
* And she's using
them tonight *

* There she goes

26:28.888 --> 26:31.924
* She a hazard to me

26:31.958 --> 26:33.827
* Got special powers,
at least *

Screw you, Lacey Grimes!

26:46.105 --> 26:47.973
Looks like somebody's
having a meltdown.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.909
My fancy-schmancy choreographer
says I'm blocked.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.912
You'd think for what
I'm paying her, she could
tell me how to get unblocked.

26:53.947 --> 26:56.749
Fancy-schmancy people aren't
all they're cracked up to be.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.252
Does that include you?
You're pretty fancy-schmancy.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.989
Not really. When my family moved
to Dallas for my gymnastics,

27:03.021 --> 27:04.123
we lived in a van
for three months.

27:05.859 --> 27:08.595
Sounds really Scooby-Doo.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.797
Minus the wacky
mysteries and Velma.

27:11.830 --> 27:12.866
[laughs]

27:14.800 --> 27:16.269
So...

27:18.738 --> 27:19.939
Looks like it's just
the two of us.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.008
And Summer.

27:27.947 --> 27:31.951
Well, I better get back to work.
I'm never gonna get this right.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.688
Sometimes the worst place
to work out a gymnastics
problem is in the gym.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.857
How about we knock off
and get a bite?

27:37.891 --> 27:40.693
Carter works at some
Pizza Barn place

27:40.727 --> 27:42.362
that's supposed to have
the best pizza in town.

27:42.395 --> 27:46.064
Pizza Shack. I know it well.
I used to work there, too.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.100
Great, then you
know where it is.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.837
- Let's go.
- Together?

27:50.870 --> 27:54.206
It's not a date, Emily.
It's just a slice.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.843
Are you worried that
Fraulein Cruz might find out?

27:56.876 --> 27:59.913
[laughs]

27:59.946 --> 28:01.680
OK. One slice.

[classical music plays]

28:44.824 --> 28:47.994
The swan must die
to be reborn as a woman.

28:48.026 --> 28:50.930
It symbolizes the courage
it takes to let go
of who we think we are

28:50.964 --> 28:53.366
and become who we
are meant to be.

28:53.399 --> 28:56.803
She's so beautiful and strong.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.073
- Her extensions are endless.
- Do you recognize her?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.042
That's your friend.
That's Jayden.

29:04.077 --> 29:07.780
- She's pretty good, huh?
- She's amazing.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.716
I can't believe you let me
think she was a stagehand.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.917
Looks can be deceiving.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.132
[applause]

29:26.965 --> 29:28.501
Whoo!

29:43.215 --> 29:45.885
- [Emily] What about your party?
- I'd rather be here.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.255
- You never had a party,
did you?
- Mm-mm.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.525
Why do you like everybody to
think you are such a party boy?

29:52.558 --> 29:55.327
It's part of my image.
It works.

29:55.361 --> 29:59.999
Really? And what about the whole
living out of a van thing?

30:00.033 --> 30:03.235
- Is that just part
of your image, too?
- Oh, no.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.104
My parents were into it.
They're sort of hippies.

30:06.138 --> 30:10.043
They actually flipped out
more when I started
making real money.

30:10.075 --> 30:12.779
Or should I say spending it.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.182
They act like I'm
spreading leprosy
instead of helping the economy.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.284
Maybe some people just aren't
used to throwing money around.

30:19.319 --> 30:22.421
Throwing money around?
You sound like my dad.

30:22.455 --> 30:25.058
I don't think I could
ever be comfortable

30:25.090 --> 30:26.958
spending that much
money on myself.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.128
And that's why you can't
learn those dance moves.

30:29.161 --> 30:32.097
Think about it.
We spend our whole lives,

30:32.131 --> 30:34.266
give up our entire childhoods
on a gamble.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.936
- Yeah?
- We're gambling on us.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.972
You gotta go all in, Emily.
All in.

30:40.006 --> 30:43.943
You can't hold anything back.
Our sweat, our tears,
our broken bones,

30:43.976 --> 30:46.412
our pain and our cash. You
gotta put it all to your goal.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.550
Two thousand dollars is
a lot of money to my family.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.452
I used to live
in a van, remember?

30:55.188 --> 30:56.254
All in, Emily.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.491
You have to believe
you're worth it.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.527
If you don't take yourself
seriously as a champion,
in every way, who will?

and close up.

I get it.

31:22.013 --> 31:25.518
Imagine finding
you two on a date.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.487
Don't worry. I won't
breathe a word to Kaylie.

31:28.521 --> 31:31.858
We're not on a date, and you can
tell Kaylie anything you'd like.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.460
Way to cut
those strings, Emily!

31:39.498 --> 31:42.168
- What's going on?
- That little thief.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.070
Can you believe Emily used
her new scholarship money

31:44.103 --> 31:46.271
to hire Lacey Grimes
right out from under me?

31:46.304 --> 31:48.941
Lauren, you're
a great gymnast.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.544
If you think you're better
than Emily, all you gotta do

31:51.577 --> 31:53.412
is go out on the mat
and prove it.

31:54.614 --> 31:57.984
You know what?
You're right.

31:58.017 --> 32:01.554
If I'm better than Emily,
all I have to do is prove it.

[indistinct chattering]

Jayden was incredible.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.126
She's pretty good,
isn't she?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.627
I've never seen
anyone like her.

32:08.661 --> 32:11.062
She told the story
with her whole body.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.965
I really felt... I don't know,
I really felt everything.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.967
- [Sasha laughs]
- Hi.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.503
- So did you enjoy...?
- Yes!

32:17.537 --> 32:19.070
You were so elegant
and graceful.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.339
And you really flew
in that grand jete.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.176
They call that ballon.

32:23.208 --> 32:25.978
It means lightness and it's
kind of a bitch to learn.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.280
Well, you got it down.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.482
It's like you became a bird.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.150
You really transform on stage.

32:32.185 --> 32:33.920
I didn't even
recognize you at first.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.387
I get that a lot.

32:35.420 --> 32:39.025
People don't expect girls
like me to be ballerinas.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.426
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to suggest that.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.462
I take it as a compliment.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.200
Grace and elegance
come from inside.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.102
If you feel it,
others will see it.

32:50.136 --> 32:53.940
And it's not easy. You really
have to expose yourself.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.976
There's nothing more
beautiful or powerful

32:58.010 --> 33:00.046
than the moment
you make that connection.

whole ballet ticket mistake?

- You've labeled every
single thing in this office.

- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

33:20.566 --> 33:24.202
Payson has not stopped talking
about your friend, Jayden.

33:24.237 --> 33:26.739
Yeah. I think Payson may have
had a breakthrough last night.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.709
That's great! Really great!

33:29.742 --> 33:33.011
I'm so happy that Payson
had a great time last night.

33:33.045 --> 33:36.381
Because I had
a great time, too,
baby-sitting the gym.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.320
Uh... is she OK?

33:42.355 --> 33:46.024
I don't mean to go all
third grade on you Sasha,

33:46.058 --> 33:48.060
but do you like Summer?
Because she likes you.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.062
And if you do like her, could
you just ask her out already?

33:55.433 --> 33:58.604
So how was your date
with Austin last night?

33:58.637 --> 34:03.175
- You said you didn't
care if I told.
- We were not on a date.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.778
We were practicing and decided
to get a slice afterwards.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.712
He took you out to eat,
that's a date.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.249
I paid, OK?
Look, read my lips.

34:11.284 --> 34:15.755
- Austin and I are just friends.
- Like you were
just friends with Damon?

34:15.788 --> 34:20.191
- And Razor? And Leo?
- I was never involved with Leo.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.795
- Or Razor.
- Still, you were
leading them on.

34:22.827 --> 34:27.433
You know, I wonder if you
could ever be just friends
with any guy, Emily.

34:27.465 --> 34:30.068
- I'm just friends with Carter.
- That's different.

34:30.102 --> 34:33.639
Carter isn't going to fall
into your trap because
he's in love with me.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.810
That's right.
Carter told me he loved me.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.679
He tells me all the time.

34:42.681 --> 34:43.816
You know what?

34:43.849 --> 34:46.118
I don't give a damn
what either of you two do.

34:46.152 --> 34:49.521

your careers by messing around
with boys, then go ahead.

let's get this show started.

let's be very, very supportive.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.360
I was wondering if I could pass
on the dance presentations.

- And your reason?
- I learned a lot last night.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.299
Jayden is right.
Grace comes from within.

35:33.331 --> 35:37.370
And I'm not quite ready to do
that yet, but I know I will be.

35:37.403 --> 35:40.806
Hearing you say that is worth
more than anything you could
have shown me on this mat today.

35:40.840 --> 35:44.810
It shows you're willing to grow.
And willingness is everything.

- This is our fault.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.791

we agree on something.

No way!

Those are my moves!

knows the choreography.

stole Emily's routine.

So, what? You're just
gonna let her win?

38:28.439 --> 38:30.308
How am I supposed
to go back in there

38:30.342 --> 38:34.612
and do the exact
same choreography that
everybody just saw Lauren do?

38:34.647 --> 38:36.649
There's no way those moves
are gonna look the same
when you do them.

38:36.681 --> 38:38.683
You busted your butt
getting this routine down

38:38.716 --> 38:40.318
and your family spent
a lot of money on it.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.787
Now, you gotta go back in there
and show them you're worth it.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.724
You're worth spending the money
and you're worth being the best.

talking and...

We can't keep putting you
in the middle of our arguments.

to compromise.

- Go with your mom's music.

You should go
with your mother's music.

No, you should go
with your father's
classical selection.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.474
- Let's not argue about this.
- We're not arguing.
This isn't an argument.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.109
Why don't we discuss
this over dinner.
Shall we go out?

40:44.143 --> 40:46.412
Don't be silly. I can go home
and whip something up.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.979
Why don't I just pick
something up on my way over.

40:48.013 --> 40:51.049
OK, but why are you so insistent
on picking something up?

40:51.083 --> 40:53.952
[down-tempo music plays]

40:56.188 --> 40:58.590
- How could you do that?
- Easy.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.125
I watched Emily working
through it all morning,

41:00.159 --> 41:04.029
and then I went in the annex
for a half hour
and worked it out.

41:04.063 --> 41:06.699
I still cannot believe
everyone thought hers
was better than mine.

41:06.732 --> 41:10.501
- That was a really lousy
thing you did in there.
- What do you mean?

41:10.536 --> 41:13.172
- After all, it was your idea.
- My idea?

41:13.205 --> 41:16.808
You told me all I had to do
was go out there and prove
I was better than Emily.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.876
- That's all I was doing.
- Come on.

41:18.911 --> 41:22.880

my choreographer,
so I stole her choreography.

I've seen your best side

and your worst.

41:28.721 --> 41:31.056
And that bad side
is really scary.

41:31.089 --> 41:35.828
I can't tell you I love you
because you do stuff like
you just did to Emily.

41:35.860 --> 41:39.864
I'm sorry,
but I can't love that.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.536
[sighs]

41:45.970 --> 41:49.874
* Wherever you are

41:49.907 --> 41:52.745
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.913
Are you gonna talk to Lauren
about that stunt she pulled?

41:55.947 --> 41:58.650
I think it's clear
who won that battle.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.486
I think she learned
her lesson.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.520
But there is something
I need to say to you.

42:05.556 --> 42:07.992
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out sometime.

42:08.027 --> 42:10.763
On a date.

42:10.795 --> 42:13.265
Uh-oh. That looks like
a "no" face.

42:13.297 --> 42:17.802
No, just a surprised face,
that's all.

42:17.836 --> 42:22.708
- Surprised "yes" I hope.
- Yes.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.043
A surprised "yes."

42:25.009 --> 42:26.645
OK.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.122
I'm just gonna go finish up
a couple of things
and we can go home.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.956
No problem, Mom.
