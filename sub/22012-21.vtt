00:01.635 --> 00:03.204
ADULT ADAM: Growing up,
I was obsessed
with Mel Brooks.

00:03.271 --> 00:06.374
He was a true comedic genius
who mastered the movie parody.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.576
Naturally, my favorite
was Spaceballs,

00:08.642 --> 00:09.910
a brilliant satire
of Star Wars,

00:09.977 --> 00:12.446
led by the legendary
Rick Moranis.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.682
He introduced the galaxy's
most bumbling Darth Vader,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.617
aptly named Dark Helmet.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.452
I can't breathe in this thing!

00:18.519 --> 00:20.254
(IMITATING DARTH VADER
BREATHING)

00:20.321 --> 00:21.889
ADULT ADAM:
I not only memorized
every line of Spaceballs,

00:21.955 --> 00:23.957
but I made sure
I looked the part, too.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.893
This was a weekend
well spent.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.862
Seriously, how am I
not the most
popular guy at school?

00:28.929 --> 00:31.265
That's what I keep asking kids
when I go to pick you up.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.600
Mystery solved.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.902
ADULT ADAM: Like any true fan,
I made it my mission

00:34.968 --> 00:36.570
to start a Mel Brooks club,

00:36.637 --> 00:38.639
and nothing would stand
in my way.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.274
No.
This is crazy.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.643
Every week,
I come in here trying
to get a new club going,

00:42.710 --> 00:44.445
and you always
shut me down.

00:44.512 --> 00:48.082
How can you say no
to a school-sponsored
Mel Brooks Appreciation Club?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.583
Let's just add it
to the list.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.952
The Ed Grimley Club,
the Q-Bert Club,

00:52.019 --> 00:55.256
the Garbage Pail Kids Kids,
The Highlander Society.

00:55.323 --> 00:58.626
But guess what, no one joined
those clubs except for you.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.195
To be fair,
there can be only one.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.996
See what I did there?
No.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.565
No one knows
what you're talking about.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.834
And that's why we need
my club.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.036
To educate people
on awesome things.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.639
Fine. But you need to have
at least three members,

01:11.705 --> 01:13.174
and one
has to be a girl.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.176
Jackie! Huge news!

01:15.243 --> 01:17.978
My freshly-minted
Mel Brooks Club needs
a Princess Vespa.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.181
I would love to,
but I'm swamped
with the school paper.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.949
Damn it. This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.818
I have no choice but to comb
the hallways for members.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.621
I love how confident you are
in your bad jokes.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.557
I'll join
your Spacenuts Club,

01:29.623 --> 01:32.493
but only if I can be treasurer
and hold all the money,

01:32.560 --> 01:35.196
which will go missing,
along with that big-ass comb.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.297
Just take the comb.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.832
Yes. I'm gonna
do so many things.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.501
* I'm twisted up inside

01:40.568 --> 01:43.937
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:46.640 --> 01:48.041
* I don't know the future

01:48.108 --> 01:51.779
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day

01:51.845 --> 01:53.581
ADULT ADAM: It was May 9th,
1980-something,

01:53.647 --> 01:55.883
and my sister had decided
to drop out of college

01:55.949 --> 01:58.586
to pursue music full time
with her best gal pals.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.221
Seriously,
dropping out of college

02:00.288 --> 02:01.822
to start the world's greatest
girl band

02:01.889 --> 02:03.957
was, like, the best idea
we've ever had.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.860
I know. It feels so good to
finally be free of this prison

02:06.927 --> 02:10.731
where we have to learn stuff
and party all weekend
and wake up at noon.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.233
Honestly, it was like
a weight was lifted

02:12.300 --> 02:13.834
after I told my dad
I left fashion school.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.903
So it went well?
No, he cried.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.671
Like an ugly cry,
where you gulp for air.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.908
Well, my dad said I'm cut off
and can't ever move back.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.377
Which reminds me,
I'm homeless and scared.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.645
Don't worry.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.480
We'll get a place in Philly
and live together

02:26.547 --> 02:29.883
so we can practice
and get in nasty fights
that'll fuel our songwriting.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.620
So, your parents are actually
on board with this?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.688
My parents get it.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.225
They will... When I tell them.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.626
What?
You, like, suck.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.728
Relax. My plan's always been
to tell them face-to-face

02:40.794 --> 02:42.463
when they come up
for parents' weekend.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.631
Enough stalling!
You, like, suck!

02:43.697 --> 02:45.233
Today's the day!
You're right.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.302
The moment
they step on campus,
I'm dropping the bomb.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.437
Schmoopie!
Kiddo!

02:49.503 --> 02:51.739
Hey!
Sorry, can't do it.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.741
Howdy, girls.
Yeah, hello, hello, hello.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.609
Let's just go to your room.
I gotta sit down.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.212
You just sat
for the last three hours.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.647
Driving isn't sitting!

02:59.713 --> 03:00.914
Take me to your dorm.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.251
You know what?
Who wants to sit
in a lame dorm

03:03.317 --> 03:05.319
when it's parents' weekend?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.288
There's a faculty mixer

03:07.355 --> 03:09.390
and Frisbee golf in the quad.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.425
There's even
an improv show!

03:11.492 --> 03:14.762
Wouldn't mind sharing a few
laughs with Yuk Yuk Goose.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.063
Oh, no, forget it.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.431
Well, time for a tour!

03:17.498 --> 03:18.866
Come on.
Let's go this way.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.168
So sorry.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.936
You have to tell them!
You're a traitor.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.405
Okay, come on!

03:24.472 --> 03:25.906
ADULT ADAM: As Erica stalled
on breaking the news,

03:25.973 --> 03:27.775
things were revving up
at our school paper.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.510
Okay, guys,
no more fluff pieces.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.879
I want hard-hitting stories,
shocking exposes,

03:31.945 --> 03:33.414
and fiery op-eds.
What do you got?

03:33.481 --> 03:36.216
The price of tater tots in
the cafeteria has skyrocketed.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.518
Where's all
that extra dough going?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.253
Good! Follow the money!
Next!

03:39.320 --> 03:41.589
I can tackle the
recent scandal in
Coach Mellor's health class.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.758
Hey, nobody told me
I had to do a whole unit
on weenies!

03:44.825 --> 03:46.994
Anyone else?
Hey

03:47.060 --> 03:48.929
It's me.
Sorry to intrude.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.798
Goldfarb!
Hit the bricks.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.333
This is
newspaper staff only.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.001
Actually, I've got something
super important

03:54.067 --> 03:55.168
and need to get
the word out.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.637
You're thinking
of joining the paper?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.372
Just hoping you'd print this
on the back page,

03:58.439 --> 03:59.807
along with the ads
and word jumble.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.443
Oh, my God!
Adam, this is fantastic!

04:02.510 --> 04:04.378
Look, you guys!
This is exactly
what this paper needs,

04:04.445 --> 04:05.779
a political cartoonist!

04:05.846 --> 04:08.316
Uh, whuzzanuh?
Oh, man!

04:08.382 --> 04:10.618
He's using Darth Vader
as a commentary

04:10.684 --> 04:12.853
on Reagan's destruction
of our environment!

04:12.920 --> 04:15.122
We are not printing
this smear piece, commie!

04:15.188 --> 04:17.325
Ronald Reagan's
an American hero,

04:17.391 --> 04:19.727
and he created
the Presidential
Physical Fitness Test

04:19.793 --> 04:21.161
with his bare hands!

04:21.228 --> 04:22.630
Uh, I feel like I should have
been a little bit clearer

04:22.696 --> 04:23.997
on the information
I was trying to convey.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.433
Oh, we're printing this,
Coach.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.734
It's called
freedom of the press.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.302
I do love freedom.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.537
Damn it!
You can proceed!

04:29.603 --> 04:31.271
You did it, buddy!
Did I?

04:31.339 --> 04:33.273
I had no idea that you cared
about any of this stuff,

04:33.341 --> 04:34.942
but I'm so glad to know
that you do.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.378
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
my girlfriend had been
waiting for me

04:37.445 --> 04:39.380
to show my passion
for politics.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.449
Just one problem...
I had none.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.583
Since when are you
political, bro?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.117
Since never, Dave Kim!

04:44.184 --> 04:45.853
That was an ad
for my Mel Brooks Club.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.055
I've always been aggressively
non-political,

04:48.121 --> 04:49.923
mostly 'cause it's boring
and bums me out.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.191
That makes way more sense.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.393
It's fine.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.828
It's a stupid cartoon
in the back of a paper.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.163
No one will even notice.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.599
**

04:58.666 --> 05:00.634
This is very noticeable.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.171
And so my love of Mel Brooks
had been mistaken
as a political statement.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.406
Oh, balls!

05:05.473 --> 05:08.141
Or, in my case, Spaceballs.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.844
But that day, things were
even worse for Erica.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.415
They have
cocktail shrimp on ice
and tiny corns on the cob.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.017
Ooh, I feel like
such a fancy academic.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.187
Well, I'm gonna get back
some of that tuition money
in shrimp.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.189
Ooh!
You take your time.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.524
Chew slowly.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.693
Let's talk now
while Dad's feeding.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.194
And remember,
we are in public,

05:27.260 --> 05:28.429
which means you can't
freak out on me.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.030
Boopie, what's wrong?
Nothing.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.801
I actually have really
great news, which is...

05:33.867 --> 05:36.437
I'm dropping out of
college to start a girl
band with my friends.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.775
I just remembered
I don't wanna be
here for this.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.243
No, you stay!

05:43.310 --> 05:46.279
I need you here supporting me
on this like you always do.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.315
But you know who
believes in me
more than anyone?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.884
My mama.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.019
Right?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.389
You're gonna kill
your father.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.291
No, don't do your whole
I'm-killing-Dad guilt routine!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.394
You're gonna kill your father
dead right where he stands.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.930
Mom, this is my dream
in life.

06:02.996 --> 06:06.534
So it's your dream
to kill your father dead
with your bad decisions?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.935
That's your big dream?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.437
Pops, I really
need you here, man.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.671
You just killed your father.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.839
What are you doing?

06:11.905 --> 06:13.974
You gotta support me
like you always do.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.109
You want me to support you
killing your father?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.978
Bevy, put this
in your food purse.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.748
Erica's ditching college
to form a band.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.650
No.
Well, look at that.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.252
Dad's still alive
and oddly calm,

06:25.318 --> 06:26.854
considering
I'm dropping out.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.857
The reason I'm so calm
is because it's not happening,
moron.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.660
I was a deadbeat loser
before college.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.294
It turned my life around.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.697
And dropping out was
the biggest regret of my life.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.931
I could have been a lawyer.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.433
She could have been
a lawyer!

06:39.500 --> 06:41.802
And I didn't
because no college!

06:41.869 --> 06:44.872
It's like you're trying
to kill me dead
right where I stand!

06:44.938 --> 06:46.574
This is a disaster!

06:46.640 --> 06:47.775
I could have been a lawyer!

06:47.841 --> 06:49.009
She could have been
a lawyer!

06:49.076 --> 06:50.844
So much for not
screaming in public.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.313
ADULT ADAM: Yep, my parents
hadn't taken
Erica's news well.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.517
Meanwhile, I was doing
everything I could
to stay out of the headlines.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.018
No kids
in the teachers' lounge.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.020
This is where we go
to be regular people.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.221
I... I need a place
to hide out.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.290
People are trying
to engage me
about politics.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.958
You?
Please just let me in.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.060
Trust me,
nobody reads that paper.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.829
Yo, Goldnerd!

07:08.896 --> 07:11.131
What's with this leftist load
of crap you put in the paper?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.666
Oh, no,
you've pissed off

07:12.733 --> 07:15.168
the self-righteous
Alex P. Keaton Club!

07:15.235 --> 07:17.170
Okay, there's been a little
misunderstanding here.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.972
See, this president's
from the movies.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.075
Don't belittle Reagan
'cause his humble roots
are in acting.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.711
The Gipper rules!

07:23.777 --> 07:25.979
Yo, Ad! Awesome the way
you slammed Reagan!

07:26.046 --> 07:27.548
We really are living
in the Empire!

07:27.615 --> 07:30.651
Oh, no! You've also attracted
the whining liberal Democrats!

07:30.718 --> 07:32.019
Back off, Dave Sirota.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.688
There's no free handouts
for you
and your lefty leeches.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.558
Says the dude who supports
a jelly-bean lover
out to destroy the planet.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.826
It's a smear campaign.

07:38.892 --> 07:39.993
It is not.
It's genius.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.495
This paper is biased.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.830
Oh, meet your
stupid president!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.031
Okay, enough!

07:44.097 --> 07:46.399
This is a Quaker school,
not the Senate floor.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.201
All right, come on, guys.
Let's get to class.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.870
Quick,
hide in the teachers' lounge.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.640
But plug your nose.
Someone heated up
crab rangoon.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.241
Adam!
Can you believe it?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.043
Everyone either hates
or loves you.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.811
You're so badass
and polarizing.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.180
Classic me doing
me stuff, right?

08:00.247 --> 08:01.849
I even showed your cartoon
to my parents,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.884
and guess what... They wanna
have you over for dinner.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.886
Dinner with Lynn
and Vinny?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.054
That's a huge deal.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.189
Wait. You haven't met
her parents yet?

08:09.256 --> 08:10.423
What's the deal
with that?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.693
Actually, I was kinda
wondering that myself.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.828
Mmm, no, Adam,
you did meet my parents.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.664
You guys had a nice chat
after the musical.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.366
You mean when I was
dressed like Rum Tum Tugger
from Cats?

08:19.432 --> 08:21.134
Oh, I see what this is.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.737
They think you're a dweeb,
and Jackie doesn't wanna
prove them right.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.138
I'm sure
that's not it at all.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.306
No, he's right.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.941
My parents were hippies
at Queens College,

08:28.008 --> 08:29.877
and my dad was arrested
protesting the war.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.879
Hmm, I thought that only
happened in the movies.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.413
Look, I was worried
that you guys

08:33.480 --> 08:35.382
wouldn't have anything
to talk about over dinner,

08:35.448 --> 08:37.284
but this cartoon
changes everything.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.720
Yes! I... I can't wait
to show your parents

08:39.787 --> 08:41.722
just how much I know
about politics.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.523
You could bring all of
your drawings over for dinner

08:43.591 --> 08:44.958
and impress them
all over again.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.227
What a lovely evening.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.530
Ohh, balls.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.667
ADULT ADAM: Or, again,
in my case, Spaceballs.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.971
Yep, Erica was dropping out.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.773
That is,
until my mom decided
to fix it.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.775
Okay, okay,
no need to panic.

09:01.842 --> 09:05.646
I will just do my
mama thing and threaten
whoever's responsible.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.649
Mom, this isn't high school.
There's no way to fix this.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.251
Trust me,
Mama can fix anything.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.453
I don't even have books
or a meal plan anymore.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.455
I cashed it all in
to fund our band's demo.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.991
Mama can fix that.
But I don't even have
a room next year!

09:18.058 --> 09:21.128
Mama can fix that.
I skipped the housing lotto
for a gig in New York.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.295
Mama can fix it.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.997
I also skipped finals,
which isn't ideal

09:24.064 --> 09:26.266
because I'm already
on academic probation,

09:26.333 --> 09:28.435
which means
I'm more failing out
than dropping out.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.637
Mama can fix...

09:29.703 --> 09:31.338
I also never wear flip-flops
in the shower,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.473
so my feet
are not good.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.442
Oh, for  sake,
Erica!

09:35.508 --> 09:37.377
You have purposely
made this unfixable!

09:37.444 --> 09:38.612
I'll fix it.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.813
Fix it how?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.815
How is he moving so fast
on a bad foot?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.784
Your father's
been activated.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.620
It's a combo of aggravation,
frustration, and rage

09:46.687 --> 09:49.757
so powerful it makes
him the most determined
man on the planet.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.191
Look at him go!

09:51.258 --> 09:52.826
ERICA: How is he across
the quad already?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.127
Is he climbing stairs?

09:54.194 --> 09:57.631
He's climbing stairs two at
a time, and without a rail.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.000
Even stairs can't stop him
when he's activated.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.036
ADULT ADAM: As my activated
dad went to fix
Erica's bad decisions,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.305
I was starting my career
as an activist.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.474
Hey, guys? Sorry to interrupt
your Tetris- ing,

10:07.540 --> 10:09.109
but I'm trying my hand
at political satire,

10:09.176 --> 10:10.510
and I could really use
a little feedback.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.780
What you got?
Okay, so, my first one's
all about

10:12.846 --> 10:14.547
how people
protest injustice.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.251
So then I thought,
"You know who's
really got it bad? Pizza."

10:18.318 --> 10:20.187
And you know who's always
eating pizza?

10:20.253 --> 10:22.222
The Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.557
So, the slices, like,
rise up in protest.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.659
Oh, this is good.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.927
I knew it.
This is real good.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.495
Uh, what...
What is this for,
exactly?

10:28.561 --> 10:30.530
I'm having dinner
with Jackie's parents

10:30.597 --> 10:32.332
and have to show them
that I'm a smart guy

10:32.399 --> 10:34.868
who knows stuff
about the world
and politics and junk.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.269
Oh, boy.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.604
You're gonna need
some others.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.240
For sure!
See, here we got lasagna
protesting Garfield.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.710
'Cause he loves lasagna.
Slam dunk, dude.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.678
Um, do you have
any different concepts

10:44.745 --> 10:47.447
aside from a food protesting
the thing that eats it?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.883
No, but I do have this.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.519
That's Baby Ruth
picketing Sloth
from The Goonies.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.721
This is the one!

10:53.787 --> 10:56.289
You for sure show this
to Jackie's parents!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.891
Please don't.
Kudos.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.460
No, my point is,
you got to watch the news,
read the paper,

11:00.527 --> 11:02.529
be able to discuss things
that aren't The Goonies.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.564
He's not getting it, Adam.
Let me explain.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.767
See, Sloth eats Baby Ruths,
like, all the time.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.235
I get it.
Do you?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.203
'Cause an entire line
of candy dies out,

11:10.270 --> 11:11.772
and you just want them
to sit there and take it!

11:11.839 --> 11:13.573
Keep sticking your head
in the sand, sheep!

11:13.640 --> 11:17.110
If Sloth is left unchecked,
there are no more Baby Ruths!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.311
How are you
not getting this?

11:18.378 --> 11:19.847
I do get it.
Do you?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.782
Yeah, you should probably
teach me some of the basics.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.083
Yeah.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.418
**

11:25.485 --> 11:27.654
Um, why is all our stuff
back here?

11:27.721 --> 11:30.023
Erica's father's
been activated, sweetie.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.124
This is crazy!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.326
Dad's been gone
for 45 minutes!

11:33.393 --> 11:35.863
How on Earth can one person
do so much so fast?

11:35.929 --> 11:38.498
That's what happens
when a father gets activated.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.500
Stop saying "activated"
like it's a thing.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.303
Clearly, it is.
All our stuff's
back here. How?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.438
Murray sweet-talked
the head of the housing
office,

11:45.505 --> 11:47.074
then got a bunch of
hacky-sacking kids

11:47.140 --> 11:49.609
to bring everything back
for a plate of nachos.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.444
But Erica dropped
all her classes.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.781
Then he went to the registrar,
lobbed a few threats,

11:53.847 --> 11:56.683
greased a few palms,
and... Boom...

11:56.750 --> 11:58.251
Your class schedule
for the next year.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.586
But I failed out.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.221
The dean literally
asked me to leave.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.590
Then he saw the dean
and begged and pleaded

12:03.656 --> 12:05.058
and even
shed a few tears.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.094
You cried?
I did what I had to do.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.429
So, what, you just want me
to give up on my dream?

12:09.496 --> 12:13.000
Trust me,
I know from experience
you have to see this through.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.101
It's too important.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.268
I'm gonna take a nap.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.970
Please, just listen
to our first song.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.172
I know you'll see that this
is what I'm meant to do.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.774
Gross.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.942
How are you
already asleep?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.911
Your father's been
deactivated, sweetie.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.113
He won't wake for another
two to sixteen hours.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.680
His feet are
on your pillow.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.085
* I'm just a bill,
yes, I'm only a bill *

12:32.152 --> 12:34.121
Schoolhouse Rock!
This is perfect!

12:34.187 --> 12:37.124
That piece of paper
has a little briefcase
like a human!

12:37.190 --> 12:38.826
I totally get politics now.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
You really should read
The New York Times,

12:40.260 --> 12:41.561
but I think
this is more your speed.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.563
ADULT ADAM: Armed with
political knowledge,

12:43.630 --> 12:46.433
I took on dinner
with Jackie and her parents.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.968
No, all I'm saying is

12:48.035 --> 12:50.838
I didn't get arrested
for protesting
at Queens College

12:50.904 --> 12:52.305
to have the country
run like this.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.107
If we did it your way,
we'd never get anything done.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.175
Guys, behave.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.544
No, I actually agree.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.979
Sometimes a bill
just waits around

12:59.046 --> 13:00.580
on those Capitol Hill
steps forever.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.649
My point exactly, Adam.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.351
These things take time.
Tell him.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.685
Tell her, Adam.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.154
Tell her what happens
when a bill just languishes.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.057
Uh, yes,
what does happen next?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.291
Uh...

13:12.559 --> 13:13.927
* I'm just a bill

13:13.994 --> 13:15.162
* Yes, I'm only a bill

13:15.228 --> 13:16.429
Adam?

13:16.496 --> 13:17.697
* And I'm sitting here
on Capitol Hill *

13:17.764 --> 13:19.032
Is that
Schoolhouse Rock?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.533
No.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.070
'Cause it sounds like
Schoolhouse Rock.
Does it?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.338
Yes, it sounds like you don't
know about basic government,

13:25.405 --> 13:27.908
so you're singing
Schoolhouse Rock
to remind yourself.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.242
No.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.044
It's, uh, no.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.545
Hey, you know
what would be fun?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.181
Adam, why don't you show us
some new cartoons

13:34.247 --> 13:35.248
that you made
for the paper?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.516
Maybe after dinner?

13:36.583 --> 13:38.151
Listen,
you wanna stir things up
with your drawing?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.619
You should hit
Star Wars.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.189
Vinny, stop.
Last thing Adam needs
is to hear

13:42.255 --> 13:44.491
you rant about Star Wars
and overblown budgets.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.394
ADULT ADAM: By pure fate,
the conversation
suddenly pivoted

13:47.460 --> 13:49.596
to the one topic that I could
debate like a pro.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.031
No, no, no.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.934
I promise you I can convince
anyone to love Star Wars.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.269
All right, I can see you're
a man of passion, like myself.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.905
Convince me.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.706
Unfortunately,
Jackie's parents
were arguing about

13:59.772 --> 14:03.243
this defense system from the
'80s nicknamed Star Wars.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.712
I only knew about
the other one.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.916
Look!
It's Han and Chewie!

14:10.050 --> 14:11.618
They came back
to help the rebels!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.420
'Cause what's more important
than space money?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.554
Friendship.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.457
Do or do not.
There is no try.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.460
Never
underestimate tiny bears!

14:20.527 --> 14:22.662
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

14:22.729 --> 14:25.265
While IG-88 didn't play
a huge role in the movie,

14:25.332 --> 14:26.900
he did get his own
action figure.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.602
See? It shows that everyone
in the galaxy is important.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.304
Oh, no!
They're dying, R2!

14:32.672 --> 14:33.974
And Luke's all, "Aah!"

14:34.041 --> 14:36.309
And then Vader
chucks the Emperor
down the reactor chute,

14:36.376 --> 14:39.279
and we realize
there's still good in us!

14:39.346 --> 14:43.150
And that, my friends,
is why Star Wars is the best.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.489
They're talking about
a missile-defense system.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.158
**

14:54.061 --> 14:55.695
Good stuff.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.097
ADULT ADAM: That night,
Jackie's parents
saw the real me.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.300
And the next morning, the real
me had some explaining to do.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.801
Yeah, we gotta talk
about last night.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.337
Oh, is that whole thing
still on everyone's mind?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.873
Adam, what happened
to the guy who drew
that political cartoon?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.976
Jackie,
that guy doesn't exist.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.477
He never has.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.679
It was just a flier
for my Mel Brooks Club.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.947
So, you lied to me?

15:14.014 --> 15:15.048
Of course I did.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.616
You looked
so relieved and happy

15:16.683 --> 15:18.318
when you thought I was
Mr. Politics Man.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.220
Adam,
you don't have to pretend
to be somebody you're not

15:20.287 --> 15:21.888
just to make me happy.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.224
You admitted that I was
too embarrassing
to meet your parents!

15:24.291 --> 15:25.492
No, that's not
how I meant it.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.859
No, it is.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.330
Look, I tried to be political,
and I sucked.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.500
But when I'm not political,
I'm just not good enough.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.868
So I can't win
no matter who I am.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.071
**

15:41.274 --> 15:43.210
ADULT ADAM:
Even though Jackie knew
I wasn't much for politics,

15:43.276 --> 15:45.312
my work was still
being boycotted.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.147
Hey!
Goldnerd!

15:47.214 --> 15:48.548
Oh, man, now what?

15:48.615 --> 15:49.782
You and me, bro.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.351
Lunchroom debate
on foreign policy...

15:51.418 --> 15:53.920
Lincoln-Douglas style,
no moderator.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.488
Lincoln who?
What's happening?

15:55.555 --> 15:56.990
Oh, you are so on!

15:57.057 --> 15:58.225
Goldberg's gonna
tear you apart!

15:58.291 --> 15:59.626
I'm not debating anyone!

15:59.692 --> 16:01.294
Let me say this once
and for all.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.064
My drawing was
about the bumbling president
from Spaceballs!

16:04.131 --> 16:05.465
Damn right!

16:05.532 --> 16:07.034
Reagan's bumbled his way
through his whole presidency.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.536
And that is exactly
why I hate politics!

16:09.602 --> 16:11.204
There is no debate
with you people.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.706
You've just made up your mind
and refuse to listen!

16:13.773 --> 16:15.742
So, our side wins,
then?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.077
There is no side!

16:17.144 --> 16:19.212
ADULT ADAM: What happened next
surprised even me.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.947
I reached down deep
and gave the greatest,

16:21.014 --> 16:24.051
most awkward non-political
speech ever delivered.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.485
Look,
I'm just a simple dude

16:25.552 --> 16:27.954
who likes movies
and puppet-based sitcoms.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.856
That's what I wanna do
with my life.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.959
Make people happy
with clean family fun.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.761
Yes, it's super lame.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.929
But it also helps
bring people together!

16:36.996 --> 16:38.298
I don't see
that happening, man.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.499
But it can.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.733
'Cause no matter
what side you're on,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.602
there's one thing
we can all agree on,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.405
and that's that Mel Brooks
is freaking hilarious!

16:45.472 --> 16:46.939
Agreed!

16:47.006 --> 16:50.543
He's done the finest fart work
ever committed
to the silver screen.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.313
Gotta admit...
I do love Young Frankenstein.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.981
ADULT ADAM:
It's pronounced
"Fronk-en-steen,"

16:55.048 --> 16:56.483
but not the point.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.252
That day, I helped everyone
find some common ground.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.954
And I finally founded
my first club.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.756
ERICA:
* I'm twisted up inside

17:03.823 --> 17:06.593
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

17:06.659 --> 17:08.961
ADULT ADAM:
'Cause even the toughest
debates can be won

17:09.028 --> 17:11.231
if you open up your heart
and listen.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.699
* Don't know the future

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day

17:14.601 --> 17:15.702
Catchy stuff.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.737
I know.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.639
Doesn't mean I can let her
throw her future away.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.375
Unless this is her future.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.745
I just

17:25.812 --> 17:29.782
always wanted Erica to do
what I never could
and finish college.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.285
Dad, look at me.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.622
My kids are all grown up,
and I'm searching
for who I am.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.958
Last thing I want is for her
to end up like me, you know?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.461
But Erica's not searching.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.996
She's found
what she wants.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.933
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
it was my mom
who got activated,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.368
and when that happens...

17:48.435 --> 17:49.769
...there's no stopping her.

17:49.836 --> 17:54.040
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

17:54.107 --> 17:56.343
**

17:56.409 --> 17:57.544
Mom, why are you back?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.448
I listened to your song,
schmoo.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.516
And you were right.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.352
It's great.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.287
And you need
to give this a shot.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.189
But you said
that finishing college

18:09.256 --> 18:10.957
is the only thing
that matters.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.892
Well, this really
isn't about me.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.595
What about Dad?
He's gonna flip.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.265
Mama will fix it.

18:20.533 --> 18:21.934
* Now I'm twisted up inside *

18:22.001 --> 18:23.002
I hope.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.437
ADULT ADAM: Truth is,

18:24.504 --> 18:26.573
it's easy to let our
differences drive us apart.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.141
It's not so hard to remember

18:28.208 --> 18:29.876
we all have so much in common.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.211
Whoa!

18:31.278 --> 18:33.313
Your club still looking
for a Princess Vespa?

18:33.380 --> 18:34.647
What about the newspaper?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.184
I figured I could use
a little fun.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.718
That's why I'm with you,
you know.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.487
Because you make me laugh.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.589
The world could use
more people like you.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.091
No, the world needs you.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.894
I mean,
you inspired me so much.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.597
I actually learned how a law
becomes a bill because of you.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.965
Bills become laws.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.967
We'll just listen
to the song again.

18:55.034 --> 18:58.438
You know, our club is about
to have a little field trip.
You in?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.772
**

19:01.341 --> 19:03.976
My childhood in the '80s
was a magical time.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.979
For me, it wasn't about
the president or politics.

19:07.046 --> 19:09.249
It was about the movies
that shaped me,

19:09.316 --> 19:10.883
the laughter we shared,

19:10.950 --> 19:13.019
the Schwartz in all of us.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.622
This is terrible!
Do something!

19:15.688 --> 19:17.857
Why didn't somebody tell me
my ass was so big?

19:19.292 --> 19:21.428
ADAM: Man, the president
is such a dope!

19:21.494 --> 19:22.562
Dude.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.031
Chill, I'm talking
about the movie.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.534
Seriously,
how do people not get it?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.636
**

19:29.702 --> 19:32.539
Now, there's a show on ABC
called The Goldbergs.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.707
WOMAN 1: Oh, yeah.
You know, about my family.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.476
And...

19:36.543 --> 19:38.445
...the creator's taking heat

19:38.511 --> 19:42.081
because they say he's
criticizing the president

19:42.148 --> 19:43.316
when, in fact, he's cr...

19:43.383 --> 19:46.253
He was criticizing
the president from Spaceballs.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.754
WOMAN 1: Yeah.
WOMAN 2: Look at the hashtag!

19:47.820 --> 19:49.489
WHOOPI: I mean, it's...
WOMAN 2: It's very clear!

19:55.328 --> 19:56.463
What the...

19:57.964 --> 19:59.466
**

20:01.834 --> 20:03.202
Dark Helmet?

20:03.270 --> 20:05.572
Take my hand,
Adam F. Goldberg.

20:05.638 --> 20:09.509
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy
as father and son.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.879
Dude, you're not my dad.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.682
Oh, yeah?
Then explain this!

20:15.748 --> 20:16.783
ADAM: No!

20:16.849 --> 20:18.050
That's impossible!

20:18.117 --> 20:19.652
I will never join you!

20:23.122 --> 20:25.492
Oh, I see your Schwartz
has grown.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.360
I'm in high school now.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.962
Yeah, I was
a late bloomer myself.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.364
Now die!

20:31.431 --> 20:32.532
Oh! Aah!

20:32.599 --> 20:34.534
**

20:46.145 --> 20:47.547
ADAM: What's this?
DARK HELMET: Uh, nothing.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.015
Spaceballs II.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.250
Oh, it's just a little script
I'm noodling with.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.319
It's stupid.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.786
Actually,
I'm super proud of it.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.121
Read it if you want.
I don't care.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.824
You know what? I'd love
to act it out for you.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.292
And so
Pizza the Hutt says,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.828
"Dark Helmet wins
the intergalactic ski race!"

21:01.894 --> 21:03.095
And I'm like,
"You know it."

21:03.162 --> 21:04.731
Then all my subjects
cheer,

21:04.797 --> 21:07.166
and the princess is like,
"Kiss me already."

21:07.233 --> 21:08.968
And I do.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.204
Awesome!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.340
I give you my word.

21:13.406 --> 21:14.807
I will get this made.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.875
Oh, stop.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.710
Take my hand, Dark Helmet!

21:17.777 --> 21:21.681
Join me, and together
we can make this sequel!

21:21.748 --> 21:24.351
**

21:26.118 --> 21:28.988
Ohh, my little Schmoopie's
having a bad dream.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.890
No!
This is my nightmare!
