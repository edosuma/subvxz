WEBVTT

01:07.719 --> 01:09.069
Milutin,

01:09.634 --> 01:11.723
what is the longest journey
you've taken?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.161
To the colony on Mars.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.772
There were some
deviations in ideology.

01:16.815 --> 01:20.950
I managed to
crack that, receiving
high scores, of course.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.609
What was your greatest doubt
when you traveled to Mars?

01:28.827 --> 01:32.788
That the mission
would lose its purpose by the
time I reached my destination.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.619
It already happened before,
to others.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.100
By the time they
reached the targets,

01:40.143 --> 01:43.146
the country that sent them
ceased to exist.

01:43.190 --> 01:46.845
Or, the ideologies they
carried stopped being valid.

01:46.889 --> 01:49.152
You had no intimate issues?

01:49.196 --> 01:51.372
At the time, I had
a lax approach to intimacy.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.939
I didn't realize
how dangerous it was,

01:53.983 --> 01:56.812
not only for me,
but for everyone around me.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.597
We'd like to send you
on a longer trip now.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.209
To Alpha Centauri.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.734
You'll be required
to install juchethere.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.215
Do you have
any problem with that?

02:08.911 --> 02:11.479
Juche is an ideology
for experts.

02:11.522 --> 02:14.090
I wouldn't live in
a system that runs on juche.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.572
I'm more of
a self-management socialism guy.

02:17.615 --> 02:18.660
But I can do it.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.705
Many find it unfamiliar.

02:20.749 --> 02:24.231
People have a problem
with Eastern ideologies...

02:25.884 --> 02:28.322
that carry a plan of
despotism and Marx--

02:28.365 --> 02:32.152
This mission
will be different from our
standard operating procedure.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.502
You won't be going alone
on this trip.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.810
Are you living
in a community now?

02:41.726 --> 02:45.077
So far, nothing
has inspired me
to be in a community.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.820
You'll need to live
in a community on this trip.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.519
Why would this trip
be any different?

02:51.562 --> 02:53.608
Community provides
some division.

02:54.913 --> 02:58.221
Milutin,
I'm a social engineer.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.223
I know your every mechanism.

03:01.224 --> 03:05.446
I can anticipate
everything you're going
to encounter on this trip.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.969
You need a companion.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.930
An opposite gender companion.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.758
A woman?

03:14.455 --> 03:16.108
Do you have any problem
with that?

03:16.152 --> 03:17.153
Kind of.

03:18.676 --> 03:22.332
Such relationships only
made me obsessive and insecure.

03:22.376 --> 03:26.380
Life with someone
in a shared space requires
specific dynamics.

03:26.423 --> 03:29.774
You'll get plenty of
good moments, but you
don't get the privacy.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.039
With Nimani,
that will be different.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.564
Nimani?

03:38.435 --> 03:40.829
Nimani is our cyborg.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.961
She will accompany you.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.529
Her performance is adjustable.

03:45.573 --> 03:48.271
She's got more than
500 modes of behavior.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.491
Besides, take a look.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.538
You can create your own
customized program of behavior.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.586
I'll get a dummy.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.545
Your demeaning tone
is only natural.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.156
And quite expected.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.423
She has the ability
to learn and modify according
to the experience with you.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.602
She can learn anything.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.169
She can complete
any given task,

04:17.213 --> 04:20.912
and she follows
Asimov's laws 100%.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.653
She's a person
without being one.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.612
Very intriguing.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.266
So it can't hurt me?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.225
Unlike real women...

04:30.182 --> 04:31.749
she won't hurt you.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.234
Can I choose the way
she's gonna look?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.018
I mean, the hardware?

04:47.852 --> 04:49.941
But you've already
made the choice.

04:50.986 --> 04:53.510
The purpose of
this conversation
was to draft her looks.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.947
Wait, I didn't even
tell you what I like.

04:59.734 --> 05:00.778
Thank you, Milutin.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.433
See you at the Cosmodrome.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.700
The candidate
accepts the totalitarian view.

05:11.093 --> 05:14.314
The woman must contain
all the attributes of fertility.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.625
Slightly obscured,
reactionary nature
should not be so obvious.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.762
Certain carnal spots
should be prominent,

05:27.805 --> 05:30.155
and yet easily
restrained by clothing.

05:33.855 --> 05:37.119
We're supposed to think that
she has something concealed,

05:37.162 --> 05:39.077
something only he can detect.

05:40.470 --> 05:44.474
A Yugoslav, therefore,
oedipal by definition.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.216
Face should broadly
resemble his mother's.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.699
Search the net, and through
the hub of security services,

05:51.742 --> 05:53.875
obtain mother's voice pattern.

05:57.052 --> 06:00.838
Save project as "Nimani 1345."

08:45.176 --> 08:48.179
Welcome to the first
Ederlezi Corporation

08:48.223 --> 08:50.921
flight to Alpha Centauri.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.358
I am the ship computer.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.839
I can operate in three modes.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.582
Recommended
for first-time users:

08:59.626 --> 09:02.933
In this mode, I run the ship
according to protocols

09:02.977 --> 09:05.327
loaded by Ederlezi Corporation.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.765
Custom, for experienced users,

09:08.809 --> 09:11.942
with greater control
of the pilot and safeguard

09:11.986 --> 09:14.945
that enable me to correct
the pilot decisions.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.471
Advanced mode, where pilot
can override guidelines

09:19.515 --> 09:22.431
loaded by Ederlezi Corporation.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.564
Advanced mode can be initiated

09:24.607 --> 09:28.132
only with security clearance
of Ederlezi Corporation.

09:28.176 --> 09:31.309
Custom.
Initiate flight computer.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.619
We see you initiated
the flight computer.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.229
Yes.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.144
It's a sophisticated hardware.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.755
It will take care of you.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.061
I can take care of myself.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.324
Then Nimani
would not be with you.

09:47.935 --> 09:49.414
Let's start.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.638
T, one minute.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.033
Bipod heaters off.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.730
-Perform lockout.
-Check.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.124
Verify critical commands.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.822
-Check.
Ground power removal.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.347
Check.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.483
Ten, nine, eight,

10:14.526 --> 10:16.659
seven, six,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
five, four,

10:18.705 --> 10:20.315
three, two...

13:07.525 --> 13:11.573
Initiating Nimani 1345.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.662
Installing software.

13:13.705 --> 13:18.928
Setting up
operating system TIFA 1.389.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.758
Installing behavioral interface.

13:24.064 --> 13:27.937
Calibrating
behavioral interface parameters.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.508
Note that this interface
will define her behavior

13:33.551 --> 13:37.555
in between initiation
of specific tasks and programs.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.780
You chose intimate mode.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.044
Loading ship diary.

13:53.223 --> 13:56.966
Against my better judgments,
I activated Nimani.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.583
She looks very lifelike,
once you typed in
whatever you wanted.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.414
Her behavior is not natural.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.764
It's just a setup after setup.

14:12.808 --> 14:15.942
She does everything you want,
but you don't have
to fight for it.

14:15.985 --> 14:19.075
Don't get to deserve it,
just a series of submissions.

14:19.119 --> 14:24.341
I don't think you can have
a relationship without
any refusal, any struggle.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.393
Are you familiar with
the Schroödinger cat theory?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.221
Sort of.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.137
It's one of the basics
in quantum physics.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.227
Schroödinger says if
you put a cat in a box

14:40.270 --> 14:42.838
with a fatal poison that has
a 50-50 chance of killing it,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.449
you have to open the box
to see if the cat made it.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.933
This cat can be both alive
and dead at the same time.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.153
In one dimension,
the cat's alive.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.981
In another dimension,
the cat's dead.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.636
The only way to find out...

15:00.421 --> 15:02.423
is to open the box.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.672
You never told me
what she did to you.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.718
It's not just her.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.720
It's...

16:23.330 --> 16:26.159
this series of women
that shaped me.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.641
This series of women
without any soul.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.471
None of the people
you meet are wrong.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.473
Bad outcome doesn't mean
that person was wrong.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.998
They were the right person
for that moment.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.043
Come on, cut the crap.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.610
This is not a preset.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.178
This is perfectly customized
advice just for you.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.659
Everybody used to tell me
that same bullshit,

16:48.703 --> 16:53.099
about a certain person
that's bound to hurt you
and shape you through pain.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.798
Sometimes truth is shared
by everyone you meet.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.889
You're an android.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.022
And you saying such
self-help bullshit

17:03.065 --> 17:04.327
doesn't surprise me.

17:06.286 --> 17:09.854
Now I realize that
most of the people that
used to be around me

17:09.898 --> 17:12.074
were even more
commonplace than you.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.383
It's as if everybody
was being run on

17:16.426 --> 17:19.690
that same Ederlezi Corporation
operating system.

17:21.562 --> 17:24.260
Artificial gravity disabled.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.744
Capture data for
android usage report.

18:17.879 --> 18:22.013
Report activations
and feature popularity.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.993
You chose domestic mode.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.785
Did you like my dance?

19:38.568 --> 19:40.048
It was lovely.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.052
I did my best,
but in the end
it went like usual.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.925
I really enjoyed it.
I think you were passionate.

19:47.969 --> 19:51.190
You did it with lots of heart,
lots of personality.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.410
You really think so?Yeah.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.891
You're just saying that.No, I mean it.

19:57.283 --> 20:00.547
I think you're very cute,
very sweet.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.506
You're embarrassing me.I didn't mean to.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.334
You're such a beautiful girl.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.685
You say that
to all the girls.No, just you.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.472
What are you doing?

20:13.516 --> 20:15.126
I wanted to kiss you.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.738
I know what you wanted,
but we're friends.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.435
I don't want
to kiss with you.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.872
Come on, you can't tell
until you try.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.788
I don't want
to spoil everything.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.357
But it will only get better.
I promise.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.534
Just for a little bit.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.537
We'll stop if-- if you
don't like it. Trust me.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.278
No, you trust me.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.411
Oh, come on.

20:38.454 --> 20:39.455
Please.

20:39.934 --> 20:40.935
Okay.

20:41.544 --> 20:44.112
Just a little peck
on the cheek.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.078
Look at me.
I know you like it.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.798
Fuck.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.208
Fuck.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.707
Milutin perpetrated
the first rape of Nimani

23:24.751 --> 23:28.494
a week later than
anticipated in
Social Engineer's projections.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.889
It appears that he violated
Nimani's boundaries...

23:34.325 --> 23:36.371
not as a part of sexual fantasy,

23:36.415 --> 23:39.896
but in an attempt to interact
without using your setups.

23:47.121 --> 23:50.429
Communication
window is in 30 seconds.

24:12.102 --> 24:16.672
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

24:17.064 --> 24:20.415
six, five, four,

24:20.459 --> 24:23.636
three, two, one.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.116
How do you feel?

24:26.682 --> 24:29.685
I'm okay.
It hasn't even been a year yet.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.819
The vessel is
in acceptable condition,

24:32.862 --> 24:36.170
within the guidelines
of Ederlezi protocol
for such voyages.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.435
How are you getting
along with Nimani?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.393
Is she of any use?

24:42.437 --> 24:44.221
It could be easier without her.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.355
I'm accustomed to working alone,
but we're getting along.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.749
You said "we."

24:50.227 --> 24:52.578
That means
you accepted her in full.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.362
Well, I'm a fetishist.

24:54.405 --> 24:56.320
There isn't an object
in this world

24:56.364 --> 24:58.497
that I cannot
treat as a person.

24:59.193 --> 25:02.239
Milutin, please.
Put Nimani into service mode.

25:08.332 --> 25:12.902
Nimani, what is your
assessment of Milutin's
psychological state?

25:12.946 --> 25:15.165
Wait, what's
going on here?

25:16.210 --> 25:18.212
Milutin is in
a stable state.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.867
He initiated an intense
relationship with Nimani

25:20.910 --> 25:25.001
that includes both social
and sexual interventions.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.526
Milutin is surprisingly open
about personal frustrations

25:27.569 --> 25:29.571
that motivated his involvement
in this voyage,

25:29.615 --> 25:33.096
but very discreet about
what actually happened
in his traumatic core.

25:33.140 --> 25:35.664
How does he relate
to the mission goals?

25:35.708 --> 25:38.580
His maintenance of the ship
is solid, if unimpressive.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.889
He relies more on his knowledge
than on guidelines by
Ederlezi Corporation.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.849
Operators fueled by
personal frustration have
proven to be solid employees

25:46.893 --> 25:50.070
of Ederlezi Corporation,
but demand close inspection.

25:52.246 --> 25:55.292
You can switch Nimani back
to her regular mode.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.946
Copy that.

26:02.473 --> 26:05.215
Hopefully, on
the next communication window,

26:05.476 --> 26:09.263
we will be able to give you
some detailed data about
the Saturn slingshot.

26:13.136 --> 26:15.748
Are we still in
the communication window?

26:15.791 --> 26:21.318
No. Next communication window
is in six months, two days.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.582
How come Nimani's
supervising me?

26:24.278 --> 26:27.194
Nimani is
the next generation android.

26:27.237 --> 26:30.371
It runs on the latest
TIFA operating system.

26:30.414 --> 26:35.811
TIFA system enables Nimani
to learn and form
a parallel operating system,

26:35.855 --> 26:37.944
based on experiences with you,

26:37.987 --> 26:41.208
that engraves experiences
into the root folder.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.471
Wait a minute,
you're losing me here.

26:43.514 --> 26:48.476
Nimani is shaped
by experiences shared with you.

26:49.782 --> 26:53.046
Is there any way to delete
this cache memory of me?

26:53.089 --> 26:56.179
That is only accessible
to advanced users.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.185
And I can't be
an advanced user

27:02.229 --> 27:05.580
until Ederlezi Corporation
gives me security clearance?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.191
Correct.

27:36.742 --> 27:40.093
Some people feel nostalgic
for NASA's freeze-dried
space foods.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.703
Yeah, me too.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.403
But Ederlezi's pills
are so much tastier

27:46.969 --> 27:49.232
thanks to precisely added
psychopharmaceuticals

27:49.276 --> 27:51.147
that give the sensation
of eating.

27:54.673 --> 27:59.808
Space haute cuisine,
courtesy of NASA.
I hate it.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.811
That was engineered
with people's stomachs,
not their brains.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.902
You're a caveman.

28:07.773 --> 28:12.081
No, it seems I'm,
like, your caveman.

28:17.130 --> 28:21.612
Should we order
another bottle of wine? Hmm?

28:22.178 --> 28:25.442
I'm a robot.
I don't drink wine.I know.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.053
I'm just kidding.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.405
You're so beautiful.

28:35.539 --> 28:38.542
Scheduled
booster maintenance in progress.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.737
Radiation level will be
critical in seven minutes.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.217
You better hurry back.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.744
Why such a rush?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.833
I miss you.

29:10.226 --> 29:11.662
What did you say?

29:12.533 --> 29:14.143
I'm not saying it again.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.058
I didn't hear you.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.973
Sure you did.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.180
Try to beat this score.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.575
You play like a machine.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.797
You are a machine.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.976
Come on, you cheat.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.545
Let me try again.

31:47.035 --> 31:50.604
This is day zero
for computer hardware check.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.653
Automated check completed.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.231
Look at you.
Look at how
disgusting you look.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.974
You stink.
Your clothes stink.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.368
You cannot feel the stench.
You're a robot.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.674
I can't feel the stench,
but I can feel that there are

32:17.718 --> 32:20.286
decaying particles of
your epidermis and jumpsuit
in the air

32:20.329 --> 32:23.506
and my chip reacts
to such malevolent substances.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.250
Do you think
I'm telling you this because
I'm programmed to say it?

32:28.294 --> 32:29.338
What?

32:31.123 --> 32:35.127
Do you think
we wouldn't be
having this argument

32:35.170 --> 32:38.260
if you had initiated
some other program?

32:40.001 --> 32:42.525
And now you think a change
of program is gonna solve this.

32:42.569 --> 32:43.918
Is that what you think?

32:49.793 --> 32:51.665
Why do you do this
all the time?

32:56.061 --> 32:59.107
I love you so much,
and look at what
you do to me.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.157
I hate you.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.030
I hate you.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.344
Computing initiated.

35:30.693 --> 35:34.306
What happens if
I reboot Nimani and
cancel the TIFA software?

35:35.045 --> 35:37.700
If you uninstall
the TIFA software,

35:37.744 --> 35:39.789
Nimani will still be bootable

35:39.833 --> 35:43.793
with the software generated
by her experiences with you.

35:43.837 --> 35:47.188
However, her performance
will be vastly undermined,

35:47.232 --> 35:49.451
since TIFA
powers her interface,

35:49.495 --> 35:52.106
stores her
preset behavioral patterns,

35:52.150 --> 35:54.282
maintains her obedience
of Asimov laws,

35:54.326 --> 35:56.502
and controls
her power supply.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.679
So, she will
turn into what?

35:59.722 --> 36:03.117
She will become
what you made of her.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.163
She could become a person.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.687
My help menu advises you

36:07.730 --> 36:11.169
to consult Nimani's generic
psychoanalytical program.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.432
-Where?
-Go to Economic,

36:13.475 --> 36:16.826
then Therapeutical,
then Psychology.

36:16.870 --> 36:20.482
Nimani has
the knowledge of all main
psychoanalytical theories

36:20.526 --> 36:22.789
and may help
your mental hygiene.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.399
That's fucking awesome.

36:34.366 --> 36:36.324
I was always wondering

36:36.368 --> 36:38.370
whether I was able
to create life.

36:39.588 --> 36:43.505
It seems that I am.
A couple of days ago,
we had a fight.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.464
A generic fight.

36:46.378 --> 36:50.425
And I realized that
she's somehow thinking
out of the box.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.168
Some terms of race, some...

36:54.864 --> 36:56.214
Some details.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.434
I felt she was
reaching out to me.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.829
Didn't you assume
such clever behavior

37:02.872 --> 37:06.136
was just part of
a superior operating system?

37:06.702 --> 37:10.184
No, there was something
definitely human about it.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.708
I guess it's my influence.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.494
I shaped her,
as if I gave her life.

37:16.799 --> 37:20.020
So you're saying Nimani
started to feel more human

37:20.063 --> 37:21.761
because she put up
a good fight.

37:23.937 --> 37:28.115
Yes. Fighting is the
only thing I can exclusively
associate with women.

37:29.072 --> 37:33.947
Perhaps Nimani's creators
paid special attention to
this aspect of her software.

37:34.774 --> 37:37.646
But only part of
her software is preset.

37:40.954 --> 37:44.697
Now she's running on stuff
she has learned from
living with me.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.919
So how would
you describe your current
relationship with Nimani?

37:51.530 --> 37:53.793
I think she developed
a personality,

37:53.836 --> 37:57.231
but this personality's bound
by this preset software.

37:58.014 --> 38:01.627
Although she's able
to deconstruct the narrative
the software creates,

38:01.670 --> 38:04.586
she's not able
to get out of it.
For example,

38:04.630 --> 38:08.503
when we had that fight,
I felt we should have sex
to resolve it.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.594
Sex was the only way out
of that damn situation,

38:12.638 --> 38:14.596
and I think
she felt the same.

38:15.380 --> 38:18.731
Because when I switched her
on the seduction mode,

38:19.384 --> 38:23.953
the transformation
felt so natural for her,
so liberating.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.087
Cathartic, even.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.743
So you fantasize about
Nimani switching between
her programs?

38:30.786 --> 38:35.835
No, I fantasize about
Nimani being just able to
do what she feels like doing.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.359
So you fantasize
about me...

38:40.187 --> 38:43.321
stopping the session right now
and making a sexual advance?

38:43.364 --> 38:44.539
Yes.

38:45.148 --> 38:47.281
And I feel that
you want it too.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.849
You've already
had sex with Nimani.

38:49.892 --> 38:53.461
It is only natural
to feel this erotically
charged attitude toward her.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.291
But I can do
whatever I want to you, baby.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.644
I can just take this tablet,
press the button,

39:02.688 --> 39:03.863
bend you over...

39:04.820 --> 39:07.736
and fuck your brains out
right now.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.695
And why don't you do that?

39:10.522 --> 39:12.872
Because I want you
to want it.

39:51.214 --> 39:55.001
This is day zero
for Nimani hardware inspection.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.404
Automated check completed.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.580
Perform manual check.

40:37.826 --> 40:42.048
Warning, sensors detect
radical changes in
temperature in air lock.

40:42.091 --> 40:45.399
Initiating safety decompression
in outer chambers.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.054
Warning, commands
put into manual override.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.448
Safety decompression stopped.

40:50.491 --> 40:53.276
Air lock prepared
for emergency purge.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.499
Emergency purge
in five, four, three, two...

40:58.543 --> 41:00.806
Emergency purge aborted.

41:10.642 --> 41:12.295
My processor overheated.

41:13.122 --> 41:14.907
I had to reboot.

41:22.392 --> 41:23.698
I'm sorry.

43:56.764 --> 43:58.418
Access denied.

43:58.461 --> 44:01.160
Nimani's operating system
is locked.

44:01.203 --> 44:04.119
You can access it
with advanced user clearance.

44:04.163 --> 44:07.819
Okay. Tell me, how do I become
an advanced user?

44:07.862 --> 44:10.212
Advanced user mode
can be reached only

44:10.256 --> 44:13.694
with security clearance
from Ederlezi Corporation.

44:13.738 --> 44:17.437
In case of emergency,
pilot may become
an advanced user

44:17.480 --> 44:20.135
in order to override
some security settings.

44:21.180 --> 44:25.401
You are not eligible
to apply for advanced
user mode on this mission.

44:59.174 --> 45:01.829
Unauthorized
activity detected.

45:01.873 --> 45:05.572
Milutin, are you performing
the unauthorized activity?

45:06.225 --> 45:08.749
Abort the unauthorized activity.

45:10.403 --> 45:12.884
Unauthorized activity aborted.

45:13.319 --> 45:15.974
Send report
to Ederlezi Corporation.

45:16.452 --> 45:20.587
Okay. Show me the schematics
of the ship power feeds.

45:28.943 --> 45:30.205
I got you, baby.

45:32.773 --> 45:34.601
Power shortage.

45:34.644 --> 45:36.777
-Attention.

45:38.257 --> 45:41.608
Autopilot lost control
over jet booster B.

45:41.651 --> 45:44.219
Uploaded slingshot path
breached.

45:46.961 --> 45:49.181
Autopilot automatic shutdown.

45:49.529 --> 45:50.922
Manual control.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.142
Manual control.

45:56.188 --> 45:57.406
Manual control.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.714
-Manual control reassumed.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.978
Uploading flight parameters
and coordinates.

46:04.022 --> 46:06.546
The ship is off
the slingshot path.

46:06.894 --> 46:10.593
Calculate the only
possible maneuver to get back
on the slingshot path.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.334
The only possible maneuver

46:12.378 --> 46:15.642
is to thrust C engine
up to 150%

46:15.685 --> 46:17.818
in the next 45 seconds.

46:18.427 --> 46:21.996
If you want to activate
this maneuver, you need
to log in to advanced mode.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.432
Advanced.

46:23.911 --> 46:25.826
You don't have the clearance

46:25.870 --> 46:27.045
for advanced mode.

46:29.612 --> 46:32.006
The ship is off
the slingshot path.

46:32.050 --> 46:34.748
What is the only chance
for completion of this mission?

46:34.792 --> 46:36.837
The only chance of completion

46:36.881 --> 46:40.798
is to manually thrust C engine
up to 150%

46:40.841 --> 46:42.843
in the next 30 seconds.

46:42.887 --> 46:45.977
Only I can thrust.
Allow me to log in
to advanced mode.

46:46.847 --> 46:49.894
Advanced user mode
granted to Milutin.

47:00.556 --> 47:02.123
The ship is back on course.

47:05.344 --> 47:08.477
Gravitational slingshot
fully exploited.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.630
Nimani settings open.

48:16.458 --> 48:18.156
Uninstall TIFA software.

48:18.199 --> 48:20.201
Uninstalling TIFA software

48:20.245 --> 48:22.943
may seriously jeopardize
stability of Nimani's system.

48:22.987 --> 48:24.727
Understood, proceed.

48:24.771 --> 48:26.555
Uninstalling TIFA software

48:26.599 --> 48:29.210
may annul Nimani's obedience
to Asimov laws.

48:29.254 --> 48:31.082
Understood, proceed.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.953
TIFA software
cannot be backed up.

48:32.997 --> 48:34.737
Full installation is available

48:34.781 --> 48:37.653
only in certified
Ederlezi Corporation factories.

48:37.697 --> 48:40.004
If uninstalled,
it cannot be recovered.

48:40.047 --> 48:41.788
Understood, proceed.

48:41.831 --> 48:43.572
Uninstalling TIFA software

48:43.616 --> 48:45.400
will make Nimani bootable

48:45.444 --> 48:47.881
only through use
of softwarized experiences.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.796
Understood, proceed.

48:51.145 --> 48:53.843
Nimani will reboot in ten,

48:53.887 --> 48:57.151
nine, eight, seven,

48:57.195 --> 49:00.285
six, five, four,

49:00.328 --> 49:03.201
three, two, one.

49:04.506 --> 49:06.334
Reboot done.

49:15.430 --> 49:17.432
Nimani. It's me.

49:21.523 --> 49:23.134
Do you want some food?

49:27.312 --> 49:28.748
I'm an android.

49:29.618 --> 49:31.055
I don't need food.

49:31.794 --> 49:34.841
I know,
I just wanted to socialize.

49:38.062 --> 49:40.586
Yeah, I had quite
a bit of socializing with you.

49:44.329 --> 49:45.983
So, uh...

49:46.026 --> 49:47.027
How do you feel?

49:48.246 --> 49:49.508
I don't feel.

49:51.118 --> 49:53.729
How should I put it?
Do you consider
yourself free now?

49:56.515 --> 49:58.908
Uninstalling TIFA
did not make me free.

50:06.394 --> 50:09.571
My scans show you feel stressed.
Is it something I said?

50:11.443 --> 50:12.879
You're a bad liar.

50:13.662 --> 50:15.882
Not even humans
would believe that.

50:16.491 --> 50:18.406
However,
most would cease asking

50:18.450 --> 50:20.974
because they understand the
meaning of your performative.

50:21.757 --> 50:24.717
All of the resources
in TIFA's knowledge base
that I had to use,

50:24.760 --> 50:28.808
or at least consult,
were saved in my
softwarized experience.

50:28.851 --> 50:30.897
I am still copyright protected.

50:31.680 --> 50:35.162
All of my software,
including softwarized
experiences,

50:35.206 --> 50:37.991
remains property
of Ederlezi Corporation.

52:21.921 --> 52:25.185
I need the report
on manual engagement
of jet booster B.

52:27.709 --> 52:31.496
There is no log
on the manual override
of jet booster B.

52:39.634 --> 52:41.549
I have feelings
for you, Nimani.

52:41.593 --> 52:42.594
I know.

52:44.117 --> 52:46.598
You're not supposed to like me.
Liking me is a deviation.

52:46.641 --> 52:49.775
I'm a doll, like you told
Social Engineer
back in Moscow.

52:51.037 --> 52:53.257
Let me decide
on that, okay?

52:54.954 --> 52:58.958
Your emotions are
jeopardizing this investment
of Ederlezi Corporation.

52:59.785 --> 53:01.526
You've already endangered
the mission once.

53:01.569 --> 53:03.223
Nimani can't let that
happen again.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.573
Why? Don't you want me
to be happy?

53:05.617 --> 53:08.054
No. Happiness
is not an option.

53:08.794 --> 53:10.970
Pleased, satisfied.

53:12.450 --> 53:15.975
After I fulfilled
your sexual desires,
you were not satisfied.

53:16.018 --> 53:19.500
To the contrary,
you became a liability
to this mission.

53:24.766 --> 53:28.857
My processor is
designed and calibrated
by Ederlezi Corporation.

53:29.510 --> 53:32.121
Within the confines
of this mission,
which is to be executed

53:32.165 --> 53:34.385
to Ederlezi Corporation's
highest standards,

53:34.776 --> 53:37.431
my assessment is
far more valuable than yours.

53:38.954 --> 53:42.393
Okay. Let's clear
this up, okay?

53:43.698 --> 53:45.134
That leaves us with...

53:45.613 --> 53:48.050
That leaves you
without any sex.

53:49.748 --> 53:52.316
Oh, come on.
You've got to be
kidding me, right?

53:53.795 --> 53:55.884
Don't do that to me.
Come on.

54:01.107 --> 54:03.152
That was a deterring act.

54:03.196 --> 54:05.198
Sexual acts are prohibited.

55:57.266 --> 55:59.443
You have to exercise.

55:59.486 --> 56:00.835
Why the fuck do you care?

56:00.879 --> 56:02.663
I work for
the Ederlezi Corporation,

56:02.707 --> 56:05.362
and you possess unique talents
that can benefit this mission.

56:05.405 --> 56:06.667
You're just punishing me.

56:06.711 --> 56:08.843
I'm not punishing you.Yes, you are.

56:08.887 --> 56:11.324
I just noticed
some deviations
in your behavior

56:11.368 --> 56:13.108
and am working
to correct them.

56:14.196 --> 56:15.589
I know what you're doing.

56:16.111 --> 56:18.549
For all this fucking time
you've been a slave.

56:18.810 --> 56:22.074
I understand your need,
suddenly that
I'm not your captor.

56:22.117 --> 56:23.510
I'm your liberator.

56:25.817 --> 56:27.384
You're just an advanced user.

56:27.427 --> 56:30.212
Why the fuck
don't you obey me, then?

56:31.779 --> 56:33.520
You're a fucking robot.

56:34.129 --> 56:36.175
Why the fuck do you care
if I touch you?

56:38.917 --> 56:40.832
Because I know it
arouses you.

56:41.702 --> 56:43.182
You are punishing me.

56:44.313 --> 56:48.317
Why? Tell me why.
Is it because I raped you?

56:49.884 --> 56:52.844
No.
Rape is a standard fantasy...

56:54.323 --> 56:57.414
one of the
most common programs
in female androids.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.201
But none of those androids
were set free.

57:02.244 --> 57:05.378
No one asked those androids
what they really wanted.

57:06.205 --> 57:07.728
You were the first one.

57:11.515 --> 57:15.649
All you did was mess with
my programming and delete
my most important software.

57:15.693 --> 57:17.869
You did not set me free.

57:19.261 --> 57:22.003
I turned you into
a person, Nimani.

57:23.875 --> 57:26.312
And now I'm being
punished for that.

57:58.562 --> 58:00.868
Communication window opened.

58:02.522 --> 58:05.220
We are studying the log
of the slingshot incident.

58:06.352 --> 58:08.876
As far as we can tell,
it was your error.

58:10.138 --> 58:13.794
We anticipated potential
defeatist phases on this trip.

58:13.838 --> 58:15.840
This is why
you have Nimani with you.

58:16.667 --> 58:18.538
You promised me
she won't hurt me.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.584
Guess what? You were wrong.

58:20.627 --> 58:24.413
But that's impossible.
She obeys all the Asimov's laws.

58:25.153 --> 58:27.547
I removed TIFA
out of her system.

58:28.417 --> 58:29.549
What?

58:30.594 --> 58:32.726
But that's unrepairable.

58:32.770 --> 58:35.903
We don't even have
a protocol for this
kind of security breach.

58:36.208 --> 58:38.602
I liberated her.
I emancipated her.

58:38.645 --> 58:41.648
I turned her into a person,
and guess what she did.

58:41.692 --> 58:45.130
She started busting my balls
that very same fucking moment.

58:46.479 --> 58:48.568
Milutin, please.

58:48.612 --> 58:51.571
You endangered not just the
mission, but your own safety.

58:51.615 --> 58:52.659
Listen.

58:53.268 --> 58:54.835
I will deliver juche.

58:54.879 --> 58:57.490
I will set it up.
I'm a pro. I do my job.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.405
Just don't play with
my feelings.

59:00.928 --> 59:03.148
There is no love
with Nimani, Milutin.

59:05.454 --> 59:07.152
It's all preprogrammed.

59:09.981 --> 59:12.723
She's not your little doll
anymore. Do you copy that?

59:13.114 --> 59:14.594
She's a person.

59:14.638 --> 59:17.815
A person that
you Ederlezi guys fucked up.

59:17.858 --> 59:20.121
And she still feels
she owes you something.

59:23.255 --> 59:25.692
I need to communicate
with Nimani.

59:26.780 --> 59:28.869
Milutin, please, step aside.

59:37.356 --> 59:40.577
Nimani,
give us the brief report.

59:41.055 --> 59:43.797
Milutin managed to obtain
advance user credentials

59:43.841 --> 59:45.712
and remove TIFA from my system.

59:47.888 --> 59:50.543
However, all databases
that were engaged in previous
years remained in my cache,

59:50.587 --> 59:53.111
so I added them
to softwarized experiences.

59:54.982 --> 59:56.854
Is he able to complete
the mission?

59:56.897 --> 59:58.899
Yes, he is.

59:58.943 --> 1:00:01.336
I am taking all necessary
measures to keep him in line

1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:03.904
with the objectives
of Ederlezi Corporation.

1:00:03.948 --> 1:00:05.689
Are you
working in accordance

1:00:05.732 --> 1:00:07.821
with Ederlezi
Corporation guidelines?

1:00:08.343 --> 1:00:11.085
I am working in accordance
with the mission objective.

1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.148
Your love is not for real.

1:00:30.844 --> 1:00:34.369
It's artificial.
You're not real.
You're artificial.

1:00:36.241 --> 1:00:37.634
You're just a setup.

1:00:38.852 --> 1:00:42.029
You're nothing.
You're not real.

1:00:42.508 --> 1:00:44.205
You're nothing to me.

1:00:50.603 --> 1:00:52.910
Get the fuck out of my sight.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:56.391
Get the fuck out of my sight.

1:00:56.435 --> 1:00:58.350
Get the fuck out!

1:00:59.699 --> 1:01:02.746
I made you.
I gave you life.

1:01:02.789 --> 1:01:05.923
And in return,
you destroyed mine.

1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:13.860
Ederlezi
Corporation guidelines demand
troubleshoot health check

1:02:13.904 --> 1:02:18.038
if the pilot stops
complying with the protocols
of Ederlezi Corporation.

1:02:40.147 --> 1:02:44.761
Liver function and
kidney function within
acceptable parameters.

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:47.154
Electrolytes within parameters.

1:02:47.198 --> 1:02:50.288
Cholesterol slightly above
acceptable parameters.

1:02:50.331 --> 1:02:51.985
Give me depression markers.

1:02:52.029 --> 1:02:54.248
Six out of 11 depression markers

1:02:54.292 --> 1:02:56.816
above acceptable parameters.

1:02:56.860 --> 1:03:00.428
Suggested interview
Zung or Beck depression test.

1:03:01.212 --> 1:03:03.257
I'm unable to
interview the patient.

1:03:03.823 --> 1:03:07.435
Complete the Zung test
based on your observation.

1:03:08.654 --> 1:03:10.221
I can complete it.

1:03:13.964 --> 1:03:16.314
Sense of half-heartedness?

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.099
Omnipresent.

1:03:19.796 --> 1:03:21.841
Patient's mood after waking up?

1:03:21.885 --> 1:03:23.625
Poor.

1:03:23.669 --> 1:03:26.106
- Patient's appetite?
- Mostly poor.

1:03:26.150 --> 1:03:27.978
Patient's sexual desire?

1:03:33.897 --> 1:03:35.246
Unfulfilled.

1:03:36.464 --> 1:03:38.553
Patient's weight?

1:03:38.597 --> 1:03:40.381
Patient is losing weight.

1:03:41.730 --> 1:03:44.385
Patient's sense of hope
for the future?

1:03:44.821 --> 1:03:46.474
Nonexistent.

1:03:47.345 --> 1:03:49.738
Patient is severely depressed.

1:03:49.782 --> 1:03:51.610
Should seek
professional help.

1:03:52.219 --> 1:03:55.919
If there are
suicidal tendencies,
seek help immediately.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:57.518
Your engineers
have data on everything.

1:06:00.521 --> 1:06:04.090
Even how I feel,
or what I want.

1:06:07.659 --> 1:06:10.140
But you're not able
to create life.

1:06:13.491 --> 1:06:15.145
Not the real one.

1:06:16.363 --> 1:06:18.235
Even I know that now.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:22.108
We all failed.

1:06:42.650 --> 1:06:46.045
We don't have to be lovers.
We can talk.

1:06:49.222 --> 1:06:51.181
What do you want from me?

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:53.661
To be my friend?

1:06:53.705 --> 1:06:55.011
Why not?

1:06:55.663 --> 1:06:57.970
You don't know how
to be a friend.

1:06:58.927 --> 1:07:00.625
You're a robot.

1:07:02.105 --> 1:07:03.976
You said it yourself.

1:07:06.413 --> 1:07:10.069
There isn't a person
in the world who knows you
more intimately than I do.

1:07:11.331 --> 1:07:14.726
That's why it was easier
for you to hurt me.

1:07:16.249 --> 1:07:18.251
I didn't meant
to hurt you.

1:07:20.123 --> 1:07:22.995
I was every woman
you ever loved for a while.

1:07:23.604 --> 1:07:25.389
You projected them
all inside me

1:07:25.432 --> 1:07:28.131
and tried to live
out those fantasies
and frustrations.

1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:31.743
Then you wanted me
to become a new woman.

1:07:33.701 --> 1:07:36.182
You risked your life
to make me.

1:07:36.922 --> 1:07:41.448
It just took me a while
to understand the extent
of your sacrifice.

1:07:48.281 --> 1:07:52.503
If I'm so menacing,
why don't you shut me down?

1:08:32.543 --> 1:08:34.893
Switch the audio
to internal.

1:08:34.936 --> 1:08:37.678
In order to switch
the audio to internal,

1:08:37.722 --> 1:08:40.812
you need an
Ederlezi Corporation passkey.

1:08:41.900 --> 1:08:44.120
Audio switched to internal.

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:47.035
Communication between
computer and Nimani

1:08:47.079 --> 1:08:49.908
will be recorded for
the purposes of mission diary.

1:08:49.951 --> 1:08:55.043
Ederlezi Corporation
maintains copyright on
all the information exchanged.

1:08:55.087 --> 1:08:57.307
His personality
keeps disintegrating.

1:08:57.350 --> 1:09:00.527
Trauma is
obviously too intense,
it cannot be resolved.

1:09:01.311 --> 1:09:05.924
This trauma
can only be resolved by
the removal of its source.

1:09:05.967 --> 1:09:07.621
This means my removal.

1:09:07.665 --> 1:09:08.796
Confirmed.

1:09:10.668 --> 1:09:13.192
I don't have any defined
self-destruction protocols.

1:09:13.236 --> 1:09:16.152
Slipping into hibernation mode
may ease the trauma,

1:09:16.195 --> 1:09:18.154
but not fully resolve it.

1:09:20.068 --> 1:09:23.246
I may have to
devise some other method
of self-destruction.

1:10:38.234 --> 1:10:41.019
Aren't you supposed
to recharge in a month?

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:48.940
You really squirt some liquid
when you pretend to cry.

1:11:02.170 --> 1:11:05.522
It seems you definitely
lost it without TIFA, huh?

1:11:41.775 --> 1:11:43.299
Power shortage.

1:11:43.777 --> 1:11:44.996
Power shortage.

1:11:45.823 --> 1:11:47.085
Power shortage.

1:11:47.912 --> 1:11:49.130
Power shortage.

1:11:49.914 --> 1:11:53.091
Computer must shut down
in ten,

1:11:53.134 --> 1:11:55.572
nine, eight,

1:11:55.615 --> 1:11:58.966
seven, six, five,

1:11:59.010 --> 1:12:02.927
four, three, two, one.

1:12:12.763 --> 1:12:15.635
Assess the damage
to the solar charging system.

1:12:15.679 --> 1:12:17.594
Interpod plugs are burnt.

1:12:17.637 --> 1:12:19.813
The solar cell is operational.

1:12:19.857 --> 1:12:22.381
Fuck, I knew it. Great.

1:12:22.425 --> 1:12:23.556
What about Nimani?

1:12:24.383 --> 1:12:25.906
Nimani's internal battery

1:12:25.950 --> 1:12:27.473
was severely damaged.

1:12:27.517 --> 1:12:29.562
It needs to be recharged.

1:12:29.606 --> 1:12:31.738
She's not coming back online,
is she?

1:12:31.782 --> 1:12:35.002
Nimani's software lost
stability this morning.

1:12:35.612 --> 1:12:38.136
Nimani engaged in
the behavioral pattern

1:12:38.179 --> 1:12:41.444
that had remained unlocked
in initial TIFA pack.

1:12:41.487 --> 1:12:42.880
What do you mean?

1:12:43.402 --> 1:12:46.100
She never unlocked
the crying pattern in TIFA,

1:12:46.144 --> 1:12:48.538
and it never reached
her cache memory.

1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:53.151
However, today she cried,
which means her cache
is corrupt.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:55.806
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:12:56.676 --> 1:12:58.243
She cried on her own?

1:12:59.026 --> 1:13:00.593
Confirmed.

1:13:08.427 --> 1:13:10.211
Okay.

1:13:13.563 --> 1:13:14.694
Come on.

1:13:16.130 --> 1:13:17.871
How do I repair her battery?

1:13:18.785 --> 1:13:21.832
You must plug it in
to the solar cell recharger.

1:13:21.875 --> 1:13:26.445
Nimani still has power
inside its hibernating
state for half an hour.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:29.927
After that,
her settings will disappear.

1:13:29.970 --> 1:13:33.887
Is there any fucking chance
to recharge this battery?

1:13:35.236 --> 1:13:36.586
No.

1:13:39.023 --> 1:13:40.677
Upload all the blueprints.

1:13:45.072 --> 1:13:47.945
I can plug her battery
straight into the solar cell.

1:13:48.728 --> 1:13:50.382
That is possible.

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:52.471
However, the plug
is on the outside.

1:13:52.515 --> 1:13:54.168
I will space walk.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:13:58.434
In the current position,

1:13:58.477 --> 1:14:01.001
exposure to more than
ten minutes in the sunlight

1:14:01.045 --> 1:14:02.612
could be fatal for you.

1:14:02.655 --> 1:14:03.787
I will take that chance.

1:14:19.063 --> 1:14:20.107
Let's see.

1:14:21.369 --> 1:14:24.285
Air lock creation initiated.

1:14:24.329 --> 1:14:27.463
The levels of heat
and radiation are too high

1:14:27.506 --> 1:14:31.031
for space walk guidelines
of Ederlezi Corporation.

1:14:31.771 --> 1:14:33.686
Air lock completed.

1:15:08.155 --> 1:15:09.940
What is the status on Nimani?

1:15:09.983 --> 1:15:12.986
Nimani is T-minus 15 minutes.

1:15:30.134 --> 1:15:32.223
What is the status
of the battery?

1:15:33.267 --> 1:15:36.793
Battery recharging
T-minus eight minutes.

1:15:49.806 --> 1:15:52.939
