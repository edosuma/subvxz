01:15.601 --> 01:16.966
Well, all right, Mom.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.700
I guess we've talked about
everyone we care about, heh,

01:19.734 --> 01:22.201
so there's no one left
to talk about.

01:22.334 --> 01:24.667
Al?

01:25.801 --> 01:28.600
Al who?

01:28.801 --> 01:30.600
Oh. Oh, Al.

01:31.534 --> 01:33.900
Well, he's mad because
there's a streetlight out

01:33.934 --> 01:37.099
and there's a pothole right
in front of the driveway.

01:37.133 --> 01:41.266
<i>Yeah, so naturally, I have to be
alert for when he comes home.</i>

01:41.300 --> 01:44.266
Well, when he beeps his horn,
I'm supposed to run out there

01:44.300 --> 01:45.800
and shine this flashlight

01:45.834 --> 01:48.134
so that
he doesn't hit the pothole.

01:51.033 --> 01:54.700
No. I don't mind doin'
those little things for him.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.900
You know, I mean,
he is my husband.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.733
Well, Mom, I better be goin'.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.834
Al will be home any minute.

02:10.366 --> 02:12.434
Okay. Bye.

02:28.567 --> 02:29.934
Hi, honey.

02:29.968 --> 02:32.266
Why'd you bring the steering
wheel into the house?

02:32.300 --> 02:34.934
Well, I figured since it isn't
attached to the car anymore,

02:34.968 --> 02:38.034
I thought maybe you'd like
to cook it up for dinner.

02:38.334 --> 02:39.500
By the way...

02:39.534 --> 02:41.600
I beeped, you know.

02:41.634 --> 02:43.700
Liar.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.467
You know,
you always do that,

02:45.501 --> 02:47.800
say you did something
when you really didn't.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.368
And it's not
just sex either.

02:52.601 --> 02:54.033
Peg, when you married me,

02:54.067 --> 02:57.233
was it premeditated
or a drive-by marriage?

02:57.267 --> 02:58.867
What difference
does it make?

02:58.901 --> 03:00.300
I missed.

03:00.334 --> 03:02.333
Well, look, at least,
did you call the city

03:02.367 --> 03:04.433
and tell them about
the pothole and the light?

03:04.467 --> 03:06.633
Al, I told you
I would do that

03:06.667 --> 03:08.667
when I got off the phone
with Mom.

03:08.701 --> 03:10.633
I asked you that
this morning.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.533
Well, I just got off
the phone with her.

03:14.334 --> 03:17.066
Thank you, my little
"air ball at the buzzer."

03:17.100 --> 03:19.500
Thankfully,
I anticipated

03:19.534 --> 03:22.834
your chimpanzee-like
attention to detail,

03:22.868 --> 03:24.633
and I composed
this little letter

03:24.667 --> 03:25.934
to the city.

03:25.968 --> 03:28.999
Well, gee. Where'd you
find time to do that?

03:29.033 --> 03:31.834
Wasn't today "Dusting
the Black Loafers" Day?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.667
Ah, homework.
Can a man have too much fun?

03:36.167 --> 03:37.533
Now, tell me
how this sounds.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.767
See, the key to dealing
with the city is that

03:39.801 --> 03:42.233
you have to subtly influence
their way of thought

03:42.267 --> 03:45.834
by using the most
diplomatic language.

03:45.868 --> 03:49.034
"Dear maggots and
foul bureaucrats...

03:49.934 --> 03:52.001
...I pay taxes."

03:52.868 --> 03:55.567
They'll never check.

03:55.601 --> 03:58.600
"You grafting pigs use my money
to wine and dine cheap bimbos,

03:58.634 --> 04:02.366
"never once thinking to share
them with the rest of us.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.133
"So please fix the hole
in my driveway

04:04.167 --> 04:05.600
"and the streetlight
above it,

04:05.634 --> 04:07.233
"and for
the thousandth time,

04:07.267 --> 04:08.233
"please...

04:08.267 --> 04:11.101
"annul my marriage.

04:12.667 --> 04:15.101
Signed, a voter."

04:16.399 --> 04:18.632
They'll never check.

04:27.367 --> 04:31.334
Mom, Dad, I am in love.

04:34.434 --> 04:37.099
He is the greatest guy
that I have ever met.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.300
Oh, right.

04:38.334 --> 04:40.934
That's why
you're home at 9:00.

04:40.968 --> 04:43.633
Well, he likes to get me home
because he is a gentleman.

04:43.667 --> 04:46.900
And he cares about me
because I am a nice girl.

04:49.434 --> 04:51.467
Kelly, it's not that
we don't believe you,

04:51.501 --> 04:54.700
it's just that...
we don't believe in love.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.468
That's why
our marriage works.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.201
That's enough
now, Peg.

05:04.501 --> 05:08.267
Oh, but, honey,
maybe love will work for you.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.700
Go ahead,
tell us all about him.

05:11.734 --> 05:14.166
Well, there isn't
really much to tell.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.301
A- a-a-ahem, a-a-ahem, a-a-ahem.

05:19.634 --> 05:23.500
Once again my dear sister
is prone to understatement.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.999
But if you want
this reporter's opinion,

05:26.033 --> 05:29.334
I shall now open
the bidding at, uh, $10.

05:30.601 --> 05:33.667
Shut up, Bud.
He's not that old.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.133
Okay.
Spill your guts.

05:41.167 --> 05:43.334
He's 41.

05:46.467 --> 05:50.600
You are dating a man
old enough to be my father?

05:52.901 --> 05:55.567
Peg, she's not
dating Lincoln.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.600
Now, pumpkin, sit over
here next to Daddy.

06:01.267 --> 06:05.167
Honey, just how much
have you loved this man?

06:05.934 --> 06:09.099
Daddy, you know I'm not
that kind of girl.

06:09.133 --> 06:11.434
A- a-a-ahem--

06:13.200 --> 06:14.700
Ahem...

06:15.267 --> 06:17.066
Now, don't get
the wrong idea.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.500
He's not like you.

06:18.534 --> 06:21.433
He's a young 41.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.233
I mean, he can still
get out of a chair

06:23.267 --> 06:27.167
without going,
"Ugh, agh, ugh."

06:27.734 --> 06:30.467
And he's
really sweet.

06:30.501 --> 06:32.533
You know
what he calls me?

06:32.567 --> 06:34.633
His "little
squeeze toy."

06:41.334 --> 06:44.366
Gee, I'd love
to meet him.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.500
You'll be nice to him,
won't you, Daddy?

06:46.534 --> 06:47.767
Uh, don't worry, pumpkin,

06:47.801 --> 06:49.633
I'll show him
the same kind of respect

06:49.667 --> 06:52.066
that any father would
show a 41-year-old man

06:52.100 --> 06:55.133
who dates
his teenage daughter.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.533
Daddy,
you're the best.

06:59.467 --> 07:02.133
Now, look, I've been on hold
for three hours,

07:02.167 --> 07:05.468
listening to the Muzak version
of "Muskrat Love."

07:07.801 --> 07:10.233
Now, I voted for Mayor...

07:10.267 --> 07:12.934
McCheese
or whatever his name is...

07:13.868 --> 07:15.900
...and I will wait no longer.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.533
Now, I have a streetlight out
and a pothole.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.567
I want you to put down
your nail polish

07:20.601 --> 07:24.301
and sashay
your fat bureaucratic behind...

07:27.234 --> 07:29.767
That's right,
your fat bureaucratic behind

07:29.801 --> 07:30.999
into His Honor's office

07:31.033 --> 07:33.066
and you tell him
that Al Bundy is on the--

07:33.100 --> 07:35.267
Hello?

07:40.367 --> 07:42.233
Hello, operator?
This is Al Bundy.

07:42.267 --> 07:43.266
I would--

07:43.300 --> 07:45.267
Hello?!

07:48.100 --> 07:49.966
Am I truly nothing?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.067
Could the neighborhood children
be right?

07:54.567 --> 07:56.066
Gee, what's
the matter, honey?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.667
Well, I called
the mayor's office,

07:57.701 --> 07:59.366
and as soon as I told them
I was Al Bundy--

07:59.400 --> 08:01.201
<i>Where's the TV Guide?</i>

08:03.667 --> 08:05.300
Oh, honey,

08:05.334 --> 08:07.400
that's probably Kelly
with her new boyfriend.

08:07.434 --> 08:10.633
Come on. Take care of him fast,
like you do me.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.300
Mom, Dad?
This is Harry.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.001
Kill him, honey.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.166
I didn't know
Kelly had a sister.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.368
Oh. Wait a second.

08:26.634 --> 08:28.334
Towel off, Peg.

08:28.601 --> 08:30.966
Hi, Harry. Uh...

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
Would you
lift your chin up

08:32.433 --> 08:34.667
and move it slightly
to the right, please?

08:34.701 --> 08:37.166
You know, you got quite
a pothole in front, Al.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.299
Yeah, I know. It's just
about to be filled.

08:39.333 --> 08:42.067
Why don't you let me
take care of it for ya?

08:45.100 --> 08:47.366
This is Harry Ashland.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.567
Look, there's a pothole

08:48.601 --> 08:51.200
in front of 9764 Jeopardy Lane.

08:51.234 --> 08:53.633
I want it fixed right away.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.266
Consider it taken care of.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.767
Yeah, right.

08:58.801 --> 09:00.834
I been callin',
I been writin' letters.

09:00.868 --> 09:03.434
There's no way in the world
the city's gonna be--

09:08.334 --> 09:09.900
Hey, look,
everybody.

09:09.934 --> 09:12.567
It's the city.
They're workin'.

09:12.601 --> 09:14.400
Peg, they're fixin'
my pothole.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.233
They must've got
one of my letters!

09:16.267 --> 09:18.401
I knew I could do it!

09:18.467 --> 09:20.667
Have a banana, Al.

09:21.534 --> 09:22.999
How'd you do that?

09:23.033 --> 09:24.266
I'm an alderman.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.500
That's a priest.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.500
No, actually, it's like
a city councilman.

09:31.534 --> 09:35.234
Well, then, why did you want me
to call you "Father"?

09:40.567 --> 09:43.201
Never mind that now.

09:43.801 --> 09:45.966
Wait a second.
I recognize this guy.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.166
Hey, you're the guy

09:47.200 --> 09:49.366
everyone says is gonna be
the future mayor.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.300
Well...
Uh, gee, Al...

09:51.334 --> 09:53.200
don't ya think it might be
against the law

09:53.234 --> 09:55.934
to go beatin' up somebody--
Shut up, Peg.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.999
Harry...

09:59.033 --> 10:00.300
I got a streetlight out.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.867
I'd hate to bother you
with it now,

10:01.901 --> 10:03.600
but what the heck,
we're almost family.

10:03.634 --> 10:04.600
Here, sit down.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.700
Peg, our finest
glass of Kool-Aid

10:06.734 --> 10:08.800
for the future mayor here.

10:08.834 --> 10:11.567
Al, can I see you
for a second?

10:11.601 --> 10:13.200
I'll be right back.
Um...

10:13.234 --> 10:16.267
Play with
our daughter.

10:16.868 --> 10:18.266
Kelly!

10:18.300 --> 10:20.368
Dance for the man.

10:20.801 --> 10:22.767
What? What?

10:22.801 --> 10:24.099
You know,
I cannot believe

10:24.133 --> 10:26.667
that you would put a pothole
before your daughter.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.966
Peg, we can always
have another daughter.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.400
But as we both know,

10:30.434 --> 10:32.934
this is the car I'm gonna have
for the rest of my life.

10:32.968 --> 10:34.300
I must protect it.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.400
Besides, this guy's
gonna be mayor.

10:36.434 --> 10:38.266
And if Kelly gets
in good with him,

10:38.300 --> 10:42.200
who knows, maybe someday I'll
be the future mayor-in-law. Huh?

10:42.234 --> 10:43.767
Think about it,
anything I want.

10:43.801 --> 10:46.033
Huh, Peg? Free doughnuts,
free parking.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.134
Just like the police!

10:50.200 --> 10:53.099
Well, we could speed
and make U-turns.

10:53.133 --> 10:54.233
And litter.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.934
And park
in the handicapped zone!

10:55.968 --> 10:57.767
Oh, Al.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.033
Mom, Dad,
what do you think?

11:00.067 --> 11:01.133
Isn't he great?

11:01.167 --> 11:02.733
We're gonna
go out now, okay?

11:02.767 --> 11:05.333
Not dressed like that
you're not.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.867
Just a second.

11:11.234 --> 11:13.300
There you go.

11:13.334 --> 11:15.067
That's better.

11:20.701 --> 11:23.600
Thank your husband
for getting our sewer fixed.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.733
It is a pleasure
to serve our neighbors.

11:25.767 --> 11:27.266
Oh...

11:27.300 --> 11:29.834
Ahhh...

11:34.734 --> 11:36.266
You know...

11:36.300 --> 11:37.667
it's amazing.

11:37.701 --> 11:39.133
The city has
fixed the hole,

11:39.167 --> 11:40.667
fixed
the streetlight,

11:40.701 --> 11:42.333
picked up
our garbage,

11:42.367 --> 11:43.934
planted the grass,

11:43.968 --> 11:45.033
trimmed the hedges

11:45.067 --> 11:47.533
and your daddy's
nose hairs.

11:48.501 --> 11:51.500
And it's incredible
we have Kelly to thank.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.366
You know,
all these years,

11:53.400 --> 11:56.266
we thought that you would be
the success in the family.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.867
Boy, was I wrong.

12:00.501 --> 12:02.900
Well, gee, maybe I should
throw on a pair of Speedos

12:02.934 --> 12:05.767
and parade around
in front of Sandra Day O'Connor.

12:06.167 --> 12:07.966
Hey! It might mean a condo

12:08.000 --> 12:09.600
by the White House
for the family.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.066
Would that
make you guys proud?

12:11.100 --> 12:13.999
Oh, we're proud
of you, uh...

12:14.033 --> 12:16.800
uh...

12:16.834 --> 12:18.667
Help me out here.

12:18.701 --> 12:19.934
Bud.

12:19.968 --> 12:21.767
Yeah, whatever.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.166
Here's my little girl.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.700
Mom, I'm going out
with Harry.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.300
Uh, not dressed like that
you're not.

12:33.334 --> 12:34.934
Come here.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.934
Let's see.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.034
There.

12:41.434 --> 12:42.400
That's better.

12:42.434 --> 12:43.900
Bye, Mom.

12:43.934 --> 12:45.667
Oh, uh, Bud,

12:45.701 --> 12:47.800
keep gettin'
those good grades.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.468
It'll really pay off
in the real world.

12:53.601 --> 12:55.200
Ohhh...

12:55.234 --> 12:56.567
My little girl.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.200
And to think,
because of her,

12:58.234 --> 13:01.500
we may one day be living
in the mayor's mansion.

13:01.534 --> 13:03.200
Come on, he's not
gonna marry Kelly.

13:03.234 --> 13:05.333
There's more to being
the mayor's wife

13:05.367 --> 13:08.233
than dancing around
naked on tables.

13:08.267 --> 13:10.200
Now, Bud,
don't be jealous.

13:10.234 --> 13:12.166
You're both
our children.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.900
It's just that Kelly's
our favorite now, that's all.

13:30.701 --> 13:33.567
Hi, Peggy. We were wondering
if we could speak with Al.

13:33.601 --> 13:34.999
Well, I don't know.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.300
He's been awfully busy.

13:36.334 --> 13:37.767
Oh, please.
He's done so much

13:37.801 --> 13:39.700
for everyone else
in the neighborhood.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.366
If he could spare us
a little time.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.233
Please,
please, please?

13:43.267 --> 13:46.567
I'll speak to you.

14:32.467 --> 14:35.067
Peg, picture, please.

14:39.767 --> 14:42.166
Oh, Al.
Please help us.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.400
The paperboy
shows us no respect.

14:44.434 --> 14:45.999
Well, we've complained,

14:46.033 --> 14:48.133
but still he throws our paper
in the sprinklers,

14:48.167 --> 14:50.467
crushing the flowers
we planted with care.

14:50.501 --> 14:53.800
He responds to our threats
with the bird.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.533
W- we have nowhere else
to turn, Al.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.301
You never come
to me as a friend.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.066
When your wife
baked a pie,

15:07.100 --> 15:08.900
I got no slice.

15:10.801 --> 15:13.734
Now you want a favor.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.533
We were wrong.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.134
We want your friendship.

15:26.267 --> 15:29.533
It is well-known when I get
food, I can deny no favors.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.467
What can I do for you?

15:33.501 --> 15:35.300
We seek no more
than justice.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.800
An eye for an eye.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.700
Kill him.

15:40.167 --> 15:42.033
This does not seem fair
but, rest assured,

15:42.067 --> 15:44.700
your paper will be on your porch
in the morning.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.966
But remember...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.467
someday I may ask you
for a favor.

15:49.501 --> 15:52.033
This day may never come,
but...

15:52.067 --> 15:54.101
we both know
it probably will.

15:56.634 --> 15:57.700
When this day does come,

15:57.734 --> 16:00.201
you will respond
in true friendship.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.267
Yes, Al.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.633
Gee, that wasn't humiliating
or anything.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.200
Well, what's
the difference?

16:15.234 --> 16:18.201
That 12-year-old punk
is gonna get what he deserves.

16:19.234 --> 16:22.333
Al, don't you think
you're carrying this thing

16:22.367 --> 16:25.033
a little too far?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.934
Never ask me
about my business, Peg.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.400
But this thing
about the neighbors

16:33.434 --> 16:34.567
bringing over food--

16:34.601 --> 16:37.333
Small potatoes, Peg.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.133
What are you
saying, Al?

16:39.167 --> 16:41.266
I'm saying pass
the small potatoes

16:41.300 --> 16:43.468
Mrs. Ricketts
brought me.

16:46.934 --> 16:48.633
I love these things.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.200
Besides, Bundy favors
won't be comin' this cheap

16:51.234 --> 16:52.834
for very long, Peg,

16:52.868 --> 16:55.966
because the city shoe contract
is up for bid,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.266
the meter-maid shoes,

16:57.300 --> 17:01.266
and I, thanks to Kelly,
got the inside track.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.099
Oh, Al.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.900
You didn't come up with an idea
on your own, did you?

17:05.934 --> 17:07.300
I did.

17:07.334 --> 17:10.433
I bought 10,000 pair
of meter-maid shoes.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.467
I talked to Harry.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.733
The contract is
practically mine.

17:13.767 --> 17:17.599
You're looking at the meter-maid
foot king of Chicago, baby.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.134
Excuse me, Mom...

17:24.834 --> 17:27.032
but 10,000
meter-maid shoes?

17:27.067 --> 17:29.600
Kelly dating
a smart politician?

17:29.634 --> 17:32.033
You guys believing
an idea of this man

17:32.067 --> 17:33.600
is gonna pay off?

17:33.634 --> 17:34.999
I mean,
am I the only one who sees

17:35.033 --> 17:37.434
the emperor has holes
in his underwear?

17:38.801 --> 17:41.567
Bud, I know you've seen
a Bundy failure

17:41.601 --> 17:42.834
once or twice before,

17:42.868 --> 17:44.966
but, Bud, this time,
I'm telling you

17:45.000 --> 17:46.333
it can't miss
because, Bud,

17:46.367 --> 17:48.567
this time,
it's not just me.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.900
<i>It's me and Kelly.</i>

17:56.534 --> 17:57.934
I'll tell you what we'll do,

17:57.968 --> 17:59.099
let's go shopping

17:59.133 --> 18:00.567
and spend
some of that money

18:00.601 --> 18:02.800
that's gonna come
rollin' in.

18:03.434 --> 18:05.567
Well, before we go,

18:05.601 --> 18:07.966
I guess
what's bothering me

18:08.000 --> 18:10.700
is that no one's including me
in the plans anymore.

18:10.734 --> 18:13.067
I mean,
I'm not Fredo.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.667
Kelly's Fredo.

18:16.701 --> 18:18.401
I'm the smart one.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.166
Lately, you guys
have made me feel

18:21.200 --> 18:23.767
like I'm not part
of the family anymore.

18:25.033 --> 18:26.900
So if you'll just
tell me I'm overreacting

18:26.934 --> 18:29.800
just a little bit--

18:32.067 --> 18:33.099
I'll tell you this,

18:33.133 --> 18:36.700
I'm not letting you
take me fishing!

18:48.200 --> 18:49.533
Look at it, Peg.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.533
The Bundy empire.

18:51.567 --> 18:53.166
Tomorrow
we make delivery,

18:53.200 --> 18:56.867
and we pick up
a check for $20,000.

18:56.901 --> 18:59.567
Oh, Al.

19:00.334 --> 19:02.301
What's wrong, Peg?

19:02.801 --> 19:04.099
Nothing.

19:04.133 --> 19:07.567
I think I just had
my first real orgasm.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.900
H- here's your paper,

19:22.934 --> 19:25.233
and thank you for not
costing me my job.

19:25.267 --> 19:27.333
What do I owe you?

19:27.367 --> 19:28.600
Oh, nothing, nothing.

19:28.634 --> 19:31.966
I- I paid for your paper
out of my own pocket.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.468
This is good.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.233
Uh...

19:36.267 --> 19:39.468
forgetting something?

19:47.434 --> 19:49.733
A whole buck!

19:49.767 --> 19:51.533
Get used to
living like this, Peg.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.533
I'm tellin' ya,
I was born for this.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.567
This is my decade.

19:54.601 --> 19:55.900
This is the Bundy decade.

19:55.934 --> 19:57.266
Aw, Al...

19:57.300 --> 19:58.966
Shhh, quiet, Peg.
I'm ruminating.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.066
I'm literally
drunk with power.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.066
Al...

20:02.100 --> 20:04.166
Ah, life is good.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.334
But not for me.

20:07.434 --> 20:08.500
Look, Peg.

20:08.534 --> 20:11.368
More pictures on page three.

20:16.234 --> 20:17.733
Guess what, everybody.

20:17.767 --> 20:21.066
I am on the front page
of the newspaper.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.633
How great is that?

20:22.667 --> 20:26.366
There are no words.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.867
Well, you could have
thrown me for a Froot Loop

20:28.901 --> 20:30.700
when I heard
he was married, but...

20:30.734 --> 20:31.934
I guess the signs were there

20:31.968 --> 20:33.733
if you just know
how too recognize 'em.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.233
The wedding ring,

20:35.267 --> 20:39.500
the diapers in the back seat
of the station wagon.

20:39.534 --> 20:41.800
The late-night calls from
that crazy woman going,

20:41.834 --> 20:43.400
"Stay away
from my husband,

20:43.434 --> 20:46.133
you homewrecking
little tramp."

20:46.167 --> 20:47.200
Oh, well.

20:47.234 --> 20:48.467
"Case of rum,
case of rum,"

20:48.501 --> 20:51.401
that's
what I always say.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.133
But you'll be
glad to know

20:54.167 --> 20:57.233
that this time,
I am truly in love.

20:57.267 --> 21:00.468
I want you to meet
my new friend, Salt Water.

21:03.033 --> 21:05.800
Show Daddy
what you can do.

21:14.267 --> 21:17.234
Can I call you "Dad"?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.066
Isn't he great?

21:19.100 --> 21:20.733
And don't worry,
Daddy.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.033
This one is single.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.900
Bye.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.600
Peg...

21:34.634 --> 21:36.366
I spent
everything we got

21:36.400 --> 21:38.266
on this stuff here.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.067
What am I gonna do?

21:40.601 --> 21:41.966
Well...

21:42.000 --> 21:45.200
you could lead
the failure pride parade

21:45.234 --> 21:48.467
atop a float
of meter-maid shoes.

21:48.501 --> 21:49.533
Or...

21:49.567 --> 21:51.700
is that getting
into your business?

21:51.734 --> 21:53.200
White crosses, sunlight,

21:53.234 --> 21:55.734
nothin' works on you
anymore, does it?

21:56.067 --> 21:58.233
But I tell you...

21:58.267 --> 22:00.999
there are other forces
at work here.

22:01.033 --> 22:03.800
Other dark, evil things.

22:03.968 --> 22:05.333
If I had my wish,

22:05.367 --> 22:06.600
it would be
to get my hands

22:06.634 --> 22:09.999
on the foul, loathsome demon
that took those pictures

22:10.033 --> 22:13.600
and caused the downfall
of the Bundy family.
