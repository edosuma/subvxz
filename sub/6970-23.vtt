00:09.960 --> 00:12.000
Fox. Wake up! Fox!

00:13.680 --> 00:16.000
- Samantha?
- Shh. They'll hear you.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.000
(woman) She's my child!

00:20.680 --> 00:21.000
Shh.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.000
(woman) No!

00:36.159 --> 00:37.000
{y:i}(shouting)

00:39.520 --> 00:41.000
(woman) That's my baby!

00:41.719 --> 00:42.000
Get away!

00:45.790 --> 00:47.000
I'm afraid, Fox. I'm afraid.

01:36.359 --> 01:38.000
{y:i}(phone rings)

01:41.680 --> 01:42.000
Hello?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.000
{y:i}- Scully.
- Mulder, what time is it?

01:45.959 --> 01:47.000
I don't know.

01:47.719 --> 01:49.000
It's almost 5am. Is something wrong?

01:49.959 --> 01:52.000
- I think so.
{y:i}- Where are you?

01:54.879 --> 01:58.000
I think I'm in a motel room
in Providence, but...

01:58.519 --> 02:00.000
- Where?
{y:i}- Rhode Island.

02:01.790 --> 02:02.000
What are you doing there?

02:02.480 --> 02:05.000
I don't know. There's...
There's blood all over me.

02:05.799 --> 02:08.000
- Are you hurt, Mulder?
{y:i}- I don't think so.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.000
I don't think it's my blood.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.000
Mulder?

03:37.199 --> 03:38.000
Mulder?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.000
{y:i}(water running)

03:44.919 --> 03:46.000
Mulder?

03:46.840 --> 03:47.000
Yeah?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
You OK?

03:50.159 --> 03:51.000
I can't get warm.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.000
You're in shock.

04:06.800 --> 04:07.000
Dry yourself off.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I'll get you a blanket.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.000
- Do you feel sick?
- No.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.000
Nauseous or dizzy?

04:22.439 --> 04:26.000
No, but I woke up on the floor
with a pounding headache.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.000
- Were you here alone?
- I think so.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.000
I don't know.
I don't remember... anything.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.000
Track my finger.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.000
- Do you know what day it is?
- Uh...

04:44.199 --> 04:47.000
- (sighs) No, what day is it?
- It's Sunday.

04:47.199 --> 04:51.000
- What's the last thing that you remember?
- I was... in my apartment.

04:51.439 --> 04:53.000
I talked to you on the phone.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.000
- That was Friday.
- I've been here since Friday?

04:55.360 --> 04:59.000
I don't know, but you packed a bag.
There's a change of clothes in there.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.000
{y:i}(shivers)

05:03.319 --> 05:05.000
Did you receive a blow to your head?

05:05.279 --> 05:06.000
No. No.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.000
- Did you take anything, Mulder?
- No. No.

05:15.959 --> 05:18.000
- Are you sure you didn't cut yourself?
- Yeah.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.000
Where's your weapon?

05:22.360 --> 05:23.000
I don't know.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.000
Two rounds have been fired.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I don't remember that.

05:47.759 --> 05:50.000
Mulder, I need to get you to a hospital.

05:50.879 --> 05:55.000
You have to be examined by a neurologist.
You have had a serious cerebral event.

05:55.639 --> 05:59.000
It could be a viral infection
or the early stages of encephalitis.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.000
If there was a crime committed,
I need to know.

06:02.319 --> 06:06.000
Mulder, the first thing you need to do
is to take care of yourself.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Mulder, listen to me.

06:08.839 --> 06:12.000
We will figure this out,
but first we have to determine the cause.

06:12.519 --> 06:14.000
You cannot take something like this lightly.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.000
If this is an aneurysm,
it could drop you in a second.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.000
- Are these your keys?
- No.

06:30.879 --> 06:33.000
You checked in alone
around noon on Saturday.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.000
The manager's got no record of any
phone calls made from the room. No visitors.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
- Then how did I get here?
- You drove.

06:41.879 --> 06:45.000
He's got a licence number of a car registered.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.000
Do you have those keys you found?

06:56.790 --> 06:57.000
That's not my car.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.000
There's blood
on the steering wheel, Mulder.

07:09.839 --> 07:13.000
The car is registered to David Cassandra.
The address is here in Providence.

07:13.839 --> 07:14.000
Who's Amy?

07:14.839 --> 07:17.000
I'm gonna find out.
First I'm gonna check you out.

07:17.199 --> 07:19.000
You have no business even walking around.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.000
No. If I've shot someone, if my weapon's
been used in a crime, I need to know.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.000
You are taking a big risk.
I feel strongly about this.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.000
I know you do, but it's my risk.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.000
- Can I help you?
- Are you Amy?

08:22.279 --> 08:23.000
No, she's not here.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.000
- Is this David Cassandra's house?
- This is David and Amy's house.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.000
- And who are you?
- The housekeeper. Who are you?

08:30.360 --> 08:31.000
We're with the FBI.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.000
Is something the matter?

08:34.360 --> 08:39.000
- Possibly. Is Amy or David reachable?
- They're out. I don't know where they are.

08:39.679 --> 08:42.000
That, uh... painting behind you...

08:44.360 --> 08:46.000
Do you think I could take a look at it?

08:46.559 --> 08:47.000
Yeah.

08:57.799 --> 09:00.000
- Who painted this?
- Amy.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.000
- Mulder, what's up?
- I know this house.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.000
- How?
- I don't know. I've seen it before.

09:09.559 --> 09:12.000
Does this house
have a special meaning to Amy or David?

09:12.480 --> 09:15.000
It's her favourite subject.
It's the house she grew up in.

09:15.799 --> 09:18.000
Actually, it's all she paints.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.000
I've been to that house.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.000
- When?
- I don't know, but I've been there.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.000
(Scully) Do you know anything else about it?

09:39.279 --> 09:41.000
- It's out in Chepachet.
- Where's that?

09:41.679 --> 09:44.000
It's about 20 miles from here on Route 8.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.000
My parents had a summerhouse
out there when I was a kid.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.000
If you've been here, Mulder,
I don't think it was recently.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
The place looks abandoned
and completely overgrown.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.000
Mulder?

10:20.919 --> 10:22.000
Mulder?

10:22.519 --> 10:24.000
Mulder, can you hear me?

10:24.600 --> 10:25.000
Mulder?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.000
(echoing) Mulder?

10:31.240 --> 10:34.000
(woman) How can you do this to our family?

10:35.159 --> 10:36.000
{y:i}(argument continues)

10:50.360 --> 10:51.000
You're a little spy.

10:54.759 --> 10:56.000
(woman) No!

10:57.799 --> 10:58.000
No!

10:58.639 --> 10:59.000
(Scully) Mulder?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.000
Mulder, can you hear me?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.000
- What happened?
- I don't know. Itjust hit me.

11:08.399 --> 11:11.000
You grabbed your head
like you were in terrible pain.

11:11.919 --> 11:14.000
You were completely nonresponsive.

11:14.559 --> 11:16.000
Do you remember any of that?

11:16.679 --> 11:17.000
No.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.000
- I remember what I saw.
- What do you mean?

11:23.390 --> 11:28.000
I had a very vivid flashback
to my childhood... except I was there.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.000
- Do you remember anything else?
- No, just that it was very real.

11:35.639 --> 11:37.000
Your heart is racing.

11:37.799 --> 11:39.000
What do you think it was?

11:39.759 --> 11:44.000
It was some kind of seizure, some kind of
acute physiological disturbance.

11:44.320 --> 11:49.000
I couldn't tell if you lost consciousness, but
it was definitely some kind of clonic event.

11:50.639 --> 11:53.000
Kind of an electrical storm in the brain.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.000
Brought on by what?

11:55.480 --> 11:58.000
That's what a specialist
is gonna have to tell you.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.000
I feel really good right now.

12:04.279 --> 12:06.000
Mulder, you are not really good.

12:27.399 --> 12:29.000
I think I've been here before.

12:29.799 --> 12:31.000
What, in your childhood?

12:32.390 --> 12:33.000
Maybe.

12:33.559 --> 12:36.000
I don't think anybody has
lived here in a long time.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm gonna check upstairs.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.000
Mulder.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.000
There's a gunshot wound to her heart.

13:20.919 --> 13:23.000
This must be Amy Cassandra...

13:24.720 --> 13:26.000
...and her husband.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.000
They'd like to ask you some questions.
I told them about your condition.

14:08.799 --> 14:10.000
You don't have to speak to them.

14:10.840 --> 14:15.000
- You mean not without my attorney present?
- I refuse to believe you had any part in this.

14:15.639 --> 14:18.000
I had their blood on my shirt.
I was missing for two days.

14:18.440 --> 14:22.000
I have no recollection of my actions. There
were two rounds discharged from my gun.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.000
I had the keys to this house,
the keys to their car.

14:26.159 --> 14:29.000
Do the words Orenthal James Simpson
mean anything to you?

14:31.360 --> 14:33.000
How're you feeling, Agent Mulder?

14:34.120 --> 14:35.000
I'm a little confused.

14:35.879 --> 14:38.000
Your partner says you're suffering
from some kind of seizure.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.000
That you had one right here in the yard.

14:42.399 --> 14:44.000
What brought you to this house?

14:44.519 --> 14:46.000
I don't know. I, uh...

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I think I came here as a kid.

14:49.000 --> 14:49.000
You think?

14:49.759 --> 14:52.000
My parents had a summerhouse
in Quonochontaug, so...

14:52.840 --> 14:55.000
But you don't know anything
about David or Amy Cassandra?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I don't remember meeting them.

14:57.759 --> 14:59.000
So, the first time you saw them...

14:59.919 --> 15:04.000
...was when you walked into this house, using
their keys, and you found them on the floor?

15:04.720 --> 15:06.000
That's what I'm saying.

15:07.279 --> 15:11.000
We got plenty of prints in that house,
some with blood on them.

15:11.679 --> 15:14.000
We're gonna run those prints, Agent Mulder.

15:14.399 --> 15:16.000
Is that the story you want to stick with?

15:16.759 --> 15:18.000
For now.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.000
Can you come to the station
and elaborate on that?

15:20.919 --> 15:23.000
He's not going anywhere but to a hospital.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.000
OK... but we're all
going down there together.

15:27.919 --> 15:30.000
Agent Mulder, I'd like you to ride with us.

15:34.279 --> 15:38.000
Mulder, I'd advise you
not to say anything more...

15:38.800 --> 15:42.000
...not until I take a look at those bodies
and the forensics reports.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
Amy Anne Cassandra, Caucasian female.

15:58.799 --> 16:01.000
Birth records indicate her age at 62 years.

16:02.279 --> 16:06.000
The subject is 165 pounds,
67 inches in height.

16:06.679 --> 16:10.000
Preliminary exam indicates cause of death
was a gunshot wound to the chest.

16:10.559 --> 16:14.000
Powder burns at point of entry
four inches below the clavicle...

16:14.200 --> 16:17.000
...indicate the shot was delivered
at point-blank range.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.000
Bevelling of the shoulder blade
is visible at the exit wound.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.000
The surrounding tissue is jagged and torn.

16:22.879 --> 16:25.000
- There are no other signs of trauma.
- Did you see this?

16:26.390 --> 16:29.000
It looks like a pre-existing,
superficial puncture wound.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.000
Do you mind?

16:32.390 --> 16:34.000
- What are you looking for?
- I'm not sure.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.000
Do you have a magnifying glass?

16:42.519 --> 16:43.000
Thanks.

16:47.919 --> 16:53.000
I want to make sure that you do a craniotomy
and a histological examination.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.000
- It's clear what killed these people.
- Yeah, but...

16:56.720 --> 17:00.000
...what I'm more interested in
right now is why they died.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.000
{y:i}(door opens)

17:17.759 --> 17:18.000
What's that?

17:18.960 --> 17:22.000
Have you jogged your memory at all?
You wanna change your story?

17:22.920 --> 17:24.000
No. Why?

17:25.118 --> 17:29.000
Because I have evidence here
that contradicts what you've told us.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
I haven't really told you anything.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.000
You said you haven't been
to that house since childhood...

17:35.839 --> 17:38.000
...that you didn't know
Amy or David Cassandra.

17:38.279 --> 17:41.000
And what's in that bag
is evidence that I'm a liar?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.000
I'm not saying you're a liar, Agent Mulder.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.000
I'd like to believe
this memory lapse was real...

17:46.720 --> 17:50.000
...and you murdered these two people
in some fit of blind insanity.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.000
- What's in the bag?
- It isn't your gun...

17:55.799 --> 18:00.000
...which, from forensics analysis,
seems to be the murder weapon...

18:00.440 --> 18:06.000
...judging from the slugs we pulled
and the execution-style point-blank range.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.000
Is any of this coming back to you?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.000
No.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.000
- Can I see what's in the bag?
- Be my guest.

18:32.119 --> 18:34.000
There are two blood types on that shirt.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.000
One matching Amy Cassandra's,
one matching David Cassandra's.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.000
Is that your shirt, Agent Mulder?

18:43.759 --> 18:44.000
Yes.

18:44.359 --> 18:49.000
Can you explain how the blood of two people
you claim not to know got onto your shirt?

18:50.799 --> 18:52.000
No.

18:55.119 --> 18:57.000
What about the prints...

18:57.400 --> 18:59.000
...in the house? Were they my prints?

19:00.880 --> 19:02.000
You won't get a confession...

19:02.680 --> 19:06.000
...because I can't answer your questions
because I don't remember.

19:10.790 --> 19:13.000
You have the right to remain silent.
You give up the right to remain silent...

19:14.390 --> 19:18.000
...anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.000
You have the right to an attorney and have
an attorney present during questioning.

19:22.519 --> 19:24.000
If you so desire and cannot afford one...

19:24.599 --> 19:28.000
...an attorney will be appointed for you
without charge before questioning.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.000
Do you understand each of the rights
I have explained to you?

19:40.680 --> 19:41.000
Mulder.

19:43.759 --> 19:45.000
I'm gonna get you outta here.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.000
You're a doctor, not a lawyer.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.000
- Did you make a confession?
- No, only to my own ignorance.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Detective Curtis,
I need you to consider evidence...

19:55.640 --> 19:59.000
...that I think casts doubt on Agent Mulder's
involvement in this crime.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.000
- What kind of evidence?
- Medical evidence.

20:02.319 --> 20:04.000
The toxicology report on Amy Cassandra...

20:04.720 --> 20:08.000
...shows an anaesthetic
called ketamine in her system.

20:08.279 --> 20:11.000
Ketamine? That's a veterinary drug, isn't it?

20:11.200 --> 20:14.000
Yes, but when ingested by a person
it can cause hallucinations.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
So?

20:16.319 --> 20:20.000
So I went to the hospital
to go over Agent Mulder's blood work...

20:20.240 --> 20:23.000
...and there are traces
of the same drug in his system.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.000
- How would that get there?
- Probably injected.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.000
There was a bruise from an injection
on Amy Cassandra's hip.

20:29.759 --> 20:33.000
I think if you were examined again,
we would find the same puncture.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.000
- Given by whom?
- I don't know...

20:35.720 --> 20:40.000
...but the presence of such a drug could
explain his memory loss or blackouts.

20:40.319 --> 20:43.000
Given the weight
of all the other evidence...

20:43.400 --> 20:45.000
...I think that's all it explains.

20:46.319 --> 20:47.000
Scully...

20:48.440 --> 20:51.000
- You don't have to do this.
- Mulder, you have to help me out.

20:51.759 --> 20:54.000
There is nothing here
that points to your guilt.

20:54.680 --> 20:59.000
Unless somebody can show me that you were
holding the gun that killed those people...

20:59.559 --> 21:03.000
...the rest of the narrative
is far too convenient and suspect.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.000
The drug in your system
already suggests other explanations.

21:07.799 --> 21:10.000
That I was partying
with a few senior citizens?

21:13.599 --> 21:15.000
You're jailing an innocent man.

21:15.799 --> 21:21.000
Well, this way he won't get lost for two days
and do something else he won't remember.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.000
{y:i}- (gunshot)
- (man) Shot fired!

22:01.920 --> 22:04.000
I'm a doctor!
Somebody call the paramedics!

22:10.240 --> 22:11.000
He's dead.

22:19.359 --> 22:21.000
I need to speak with Detective Curtis!

22:29.720 --> 22:33.000
Did this officer have a history of depression
or mental illness?

22:34.480 --> 22:38.000
He'd been remanded from his beat
assignment to a deskjob a year ago.

22:38.599 --> 22:44.000
His former partner had complained about
his tendency toward extreme irritability...

22:44.160 --> 22:46.000
...and confabulation of the truth.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.000
How do you mean?

22:47.359 --> 22:52.000
He'd become something of ajoke on the
force. One of those guys who believes in...

22:53.519 --> 22:56.000
...extraterrestrials, stuff like that.

22:58.359 --> 23:00.000
Do you see these photos?

23:01.759 --> 23:04.000
- Yeah.
- Does this mean anything to you?

23:04.759 --> 23:06.000
Should it?

23:06.559 --> 23:09.000
I think it speaks
to a pronounced mental illness.

23:10.519 --> 23:15.000
The compulsive and repetitive act of
removing his own image from these photos...

23:15.440 --> 23:19.000
...leads me to believe he not only believed
these stories but was traumatised by them.

23:19.640 --> 23:24.000
You told me this was gonna help explain
something about your partner's crime.

23:29.799 --> 23:30.000
What's that?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.000
Amy Cassandra.

23:36.680 --> 23:41.000
Both your officer and Amy Cassandra
had puncture wounds at the frontal lobe.

23:41.640 --> 23:46.000
Amy Cassandra's was a deep puncture
through the cranium to the dura mater.

23:46.799 --> 23:49.000
- My officer had the same thing?
- Yes.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.000
I think your officer knew of Amy Cassandra,
and his suicide is linked to her death...

23:55.390 --> 23:59.000
...which leads me to believe
that we're not dealing with murder.

23:59.319 --> 24:02.000
It's something else.
It's possibly even a suicide pact.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.000
You're gonna have to prove that to me.

24:18.279 --> 24:19.000
{y:i}(arguing)

24:33.599 --> 24:37.000
(woman) Not Samantha! Not Samantha!

24:37.640 --> 24:38.000
No!

24:38.839 --> 24:40.000
No, not my baby!

24:50.640 --> 24:51.000
Guard!

24:53.599 --> 24:54.000
Guard!

24:55.480 --> 24:57.000
I need to talk to someone!

25:00.640 --> 25:01.000
Guard!

25:06.960 --> 25:11.000
According to the corrections officer,
he kept everybody awake last night.

25:11.359 --> 25:14.000
He's demanding to talk to you.
He shut up about an hour ago.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.000
Did he say about what?

25:17.519 --> 25:21.000
I think your partner's memories
are coming back to him.

25:28.839 --> 25:31.000
I need to talk to him alone, if you don't mind.

25:39.759 --> 25:43.000
- I heard you didn't get much sleep.
- I didn't kill those people.

25:43.519 --> 25:44.000
I know that.

25:45.359 --> 25:49.000
I think I've gathered enough evidence
of your innocence to get you out.

25:49.759 --> 25:52.000
- From where?
- The forensics reports.

25:53.759 --> 25:58.000
The, uh... The shirt you were wearing
did have the victims' blood on it...

25:58.599 --> 26:03.000
...but the blood splatter pattern
doesn't match the point-of-entry detail.

26:03.160 --> 26:07.000
Detective Curtis has been able to put
together enough evidence...

26:07.790 --> 26:12.000
...to make a press statement saying their
death was the result of a murder-suicide.

26:12.839 --> 26:15.000
- But I was there.
- Yes.

26:16.559 --> 26:18.000
And I still don't remember why.

26:18.519 --> 26:21.000
I think I have an idea about that too.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.000
Amy Cassandra believed
she was an alien abductee.

26:25.319 --> 26:28.000
- And I contacted her?
- Yes. Apparently.

26:28.920 --> 26:35.000
Amy had begun psychiatric treatment
that was effectively recovering her past.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.000
The repetitive behaviour
exhibited in those paintings...

26:39.390 --> 26:41.000
...was an expression of that treatment.

26:41.599 --> 26:44.000
But why shoot herself and her husband?

26:44.839 --> 26:49.000
I can't say definitively,
butjudging from an identical suicide...

26:49.119 --> 26:52.000
...of a police officer
receiving the same psychiatric care...

26:52.960 --> 26:57.000
...I believe the victims were suffering from
Waxman-Geschwind Syndrome...

26:57.200 --> 27:01.000
...the symptoms of which are trancelike states
leading to vivid dreams about the past.

27:01.839 --> 27:05.000
Dreams that are more detailed
than the conscious mind can recall.

27:05.519 --> 27:11.000
It's also called Dostoevsky's Syndrome
because the novelist suffered from it too.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.000
What was I doing there
and why didn't I do anything to stop it?

27:14.640 --> 27:16.000
I can't explain that.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.000
I've arranged for your arraignment
in one hour.

27:19.960 --> 27:25.000
By then Detective Curtis and I will have
enough forensics data for your release.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.000
I still need to know why though.

27:39.519 --> 27:42.000
This is the office of the psychologist
that treated Amy.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.000
- Have you been here before?
- I don't know, but we found my car.

27:59.559 --> 28:01.000
It's been here for a few days.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
What's the psychologist's name?

28:05.799 --> 28:07.000
{y:i}(knocking)

28:08.920 --> 28:10.000
Hello.

28:10.359 --> 28:11.000
Dr Goldstein?

28:12.200 --> 28:14.000
My name is Fox Mulder. Have we met?

28:15.119 --> 28:16.000
I don't believe so.

28:17.790 --> 28:19.000
My receptionist says you're from the FBI?

28:19.640 --> 28:23.000
Yes, we're investigating
the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra.

28:23.519 --> 28:25.000
Amy was a patient of yours?

28:25.279 --> 28:27.000
Yes. Please, sit down.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.000
I was very upset to learn about Amy.

28:32.240 --> 28:37.000
A troubled woman who'd struggled through
an unfortunate period of darkness in her life.

28:38.790 --> 28:41.000
Are you referring to her belief
that she was an abductee?

28:41.119 --> 28:45.000
This term alien abductee, although I
recognise there is an associated syndrome...

28:45.599 --> 28:50.000
...and a remarkable collection of shared
experiences for those who believe in it...

28:50.680 --> 28:55.000
...my treatment of Amy was an aggressive
method to access repressed memories.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.000
How do you mean, aggressive?

28:57.839 --> 29:03.000
My method of therapy simulates an electrical
impulse in the brain using light and sound.

29:03.759 --> 29:07.000
Did you use this treatment
on a police officer named Michael Fazekus?

29:07.880 --> 29:08.000
Yes. Why?

29:09.240 --> 29:11.000
He shot himself in the head last night.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.000
Oh, my God.

29:14.759 --> 29:17.000
Is this an accepted form
of medical treatment?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's unconventional, but not invasive.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.000
Are you familiar
with Waxman-Geschwind Syndrome?

29:23.920 --> 29:24.000
Yes.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.000
Did you know Amy Cassandra
suffered from it?

29:27.240 --> 29:30.000
Waxman-Geschwind,
if you know anything about it...

29:30.319 --> 29:35.000
...is not necessarily a destructive condition.
Amy, after undergoing treatment...

29:35.720 --> 29:38.000
...had periods of extreme happiness
and creativity.

29:39.390 --> 29:43.000
But you had no idea, you had no indication
she might have taken her own life?

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
No!

29:45.759 --> 29:46.000
Of course not.

29:46.839 --> 29:49.000
I have been in practice for over 40 years.

29:49.880 --> 29:54.000
I have a very good ethical and professional
reputation, if you'd care to check.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.000
That won't be necessary.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.000
I know what you do.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.000
I have been here before.
I met Dr Goldstein with Amy.

30:09.799 --> 30:14.000
He's lying about more than that. I think
he administered ketamine to Amy and you.

30:14.759 --> 30:19.000
I think that you were treated by him
and that your seizures are a result of that.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.000
I think you're right.

30:22.839 --> 30:27.000
Why would you do that? Why undergo
something as crazy and dangerous as this?

30:28.440 --> 30:29.000
Mulder?

30:29.960 --> 30:31.000
Mulder!

30:31.200 --> 30:32.000
(echoing) Mulder?

30:33.759 --> 30:34.000
My baby!

30:39.200 --> 30:40.000
Mulder?

30:43.390 --> 30:43.880
I'm fine.

30:43.960 --> 30:49.000
No. You do not belong at work. You need to
be somewhere where you can be monitored.

30:49.759 --> 30:53.000
You are a danger to yourself
and a danger to me.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.000
- Do you hear me?
- Gimme the car keys.

30:55.319 --> 30:58.000
You're not doing anything
until these symptoms go away.

30:58.119 --> 31:00.000
Scully, I don't want
these symptoms to go away.

31:00.759 --> 31:04.000
Whatever's happening to me is allowing me
to go back into my unconscious.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.000
The truth is in there
and I've gotten access to it.

31:08.790 --> 31:12.000
What happened to my sister, the reason
she was taken, it's becoming clear to me.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.000
- I need to know that. Give me the keys.
- To go where?

31:15.720 --> 31:17.000
To my mother's in Greenwich.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.000
OK. But I'm driving.

31:39.119 --> 31:40.000
Fox!

31:41.799 --> 31:43.000
I need to speak to you.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.000
What's happened, Fox?

31:45.160 --> 31:47.000
You've kept secrets from me.

31:47.359 --> 31:50.000
- What's wrong with him?
- He's undergone a treatment.

31:50.119 --> 31:53.000
He believes it's helped him
to remember things.

31:53.799 --> 31:54.000
Remember what?

31:54.960 --> 31:57.000
You said they took Samantha
because you had to make a choice.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
But that's not how it happened.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.000
It wasn't your choice to make.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.000
What do you want to hear from me?

32:05.279 --> 32:10.000
I wanna know what happened that night
and I need to speak to you privately.

32:19.119 --> 32:21.000
You had a relationship with him.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.000
- Who?
- You know who.

32:23.759 --> 32:25.000
The man who worked with my father.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.000
The man who forced you
to choose Samantha.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.000
- No, Fox...
- Yes!

32:30.680 --> 32:33.000
You betrayed my father, your husband.

32:33.559 --> 32:34.000
Never!

32:34.799 --> 32:36.000
How far back did it go?

32:37.960 --> 32:41.000
How dare you!
How dare you come here and accuse me?

32:41.799 --> 32:43.000
Who... is my father?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.000
What do you want, to kill him again?

32:46.359 --> 32:50.000
Just answer the question, Mom.
Just answer the question!

32:50.200 --> 32:54.000
I am your mother, and I will not tolerate
any more of your questions!

32:56.519 --> 32:58.000
You're bleeding, Fox.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.000
{y:i}(car door slams)

33:16.279 --> 33:18.000
{y:i}(car engine starts)

33:50.200 --> 33:51.000
What did you do to me?

33:52.519 --> 33:55.000
- I told you...
- I asked you to treat me to recover my past.

33:55.759 --> 33:58.000
- I did nothing wrong.
- You put a hole in my head.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.000
- An electrical stimulation.
- You triggered my memory.

34:01.680 --> 34:04.000
Yes, as you had hoped.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.000
Now I want you to finish the job.

34:13.389 --> 34:14.000
Let's do it.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.000
I wanna remember.

34:58.239 --> 34:59.000
You're a spy.

35:00.239 --> 35:01.000
(Mrs Mulder) No! Fox?

35:06.790 --> 35:07.000
{y:i}(groans)

35:07.880 --> 35:08.000
Fox.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.000
{y:i}(crying)

35:09.440 --> 35:10.000
You're a spy.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.000
- Where are they?
- Why?

35:15.719 --> 35:16.000
Fox?

35:27.480 --> 35:28.000
Not Samantha!

35:29.800 --> 35:30.000
Fox!

35:48.159 --> 35:49.000
{y:i}(whirring)

36:13.360 --> 36:14.000
{y:i}(banging)

36:17.880 --> 36:22.000
Dr Charles Goldstein? You're under arrest.
Keep your hands where they are.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.000
Bag those gloves as evidence.
Read him his rights.

36:25.119 --> 36:27.000
(officer) Hands behind your back, please.

36:27.679 --> 36:30.000
(Detective Curtis) Where is he?

36:30.360 --> 36:31.000
Mulder?

36:41.390 --> 36:43.000
- Where's Mulder?
- He's not here.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.000
Did you ask Dr Goldstein?

36:45.679 --> 36:47.000
He wouldn't say one way or the other.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.000
- Stop that car!
- Hey! Hold it!

36:52.159 --> 36:53.000
Hold up! Hold up!

36:55.239 --> 36:56.000
Open the back door.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.000
What did you do to him?

37:00.159 --> 37:03.000
I know he came back here.
This is the only place he would've gone.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.000
Did you treat him?

37:06.390 --> 37:07.000
Damn it! Answer me!

37:08.390 --> 37:08.800
Yes.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.000
- Where is he now?
- I don't know where he went.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.000
What was the last thing he said?

37:16.159 --> 37:18.000
He said he was going to exorcise his demons.

37:29.239 --> 37:31.000
{y:i}(car approaching)

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
- Agent Scully?
- Yeah.

37:36.559 --> 37:38.000
Frank lmhof.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.000
Hi. Is he in there?

37:39.880 --> 37:43.000
Saw the light go on a coupla minutes ago.
Gotta be somebody in there.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.000
- We got here as soon as you called.
- All right.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.000
The man in there is armed. He's a federal
officer in need of medical attention.

37:51.239 --> 37:54.000
He is not himself.
Now I'm going in there.

37:54.320 --> 37:59.000
If at any time he should flee that house,
you need to tell your officers not to shoot.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.000
Mulder?

38:48.559 --> 38:50.000
Leave me alone, Scully.

39:03.719 --> 39:05.000
Mulder, it's me.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.000
Scully, leave me alone.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.000
{y:i}(shouting)

39:14.920 --> 39:15.000
Fox.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.000
{y:i}(gasping)

39:29.920 --> 39:32.000
It's... all falling into place.

39:32.599 --> 39:33.000
Put down the gun.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.000
No, don't try to stop me.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.000
Please, Mulder.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.000
(Samantha) Wake up! Fox!

39:40.960 --> 39:42.000
(Mrs Mulder) No! She's my baby!

39:49.790 --> 39:51.000
(Samantha) I'm afraid, Fox. I'm afraid.

39:54.790 --> 39:55.000
Get away!

39:56.880 --> 39:58.000
Are you gonna shoot me?

39:59.599 --> 40:01.000
Is that how much this means to you?

40:03.639 --> 40:07.000
Mulder, listen to me. You have
been given a powerful hallucinogen.

40:08.390 --> 40:11.000
You don't know that
these memories are yours.

40:13.199 --> 40:16.000
This is not the way to the truth, Mulder.

40:18.390 --> 40:20.000
- You've got to trust me.
- Shut up!

40:22.159 --> 40:23.000
Put down the gun.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.000
Let it go.

40:37.239 --> 40:40.000
- (gunshots)
- We've got shots fired! Move!

40:40.320 --> 40:41.000
{y:i}(gunshots continue)

41:19.390 --> 41:23.000
{y:i}(Scully's voice) Cleared of any wrongdoing
{y:i}in the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra...

41:23.119 --> 41:27.000
{y:i}... Agent Mulder still has no recollection
{y:i}of the events that led to their deaths.

41:28.800 --> 41:33.000
{y:i}His seizures have subsided with no evidence
{y:i}of permanent cerebral damage...

41:34.559 --> 41:38.000
{y:i}... but I am concerned that this experience
{y:i}will have a lasting effect.

41:40.519 --> 41:45.000
{y:i}Agent Mulder undertook this treatment
{y:i}hoping to lay claim to his past...

41:45.199 --> 41:50.000
{y:i}... that by retrieving memories lost to him,
{y:i}he might finally understand the path he's on.

41:50.960 --> 41:55.000
{y:i}If that knowledge remains elusive,
{y:i}and if it's only by knowing where he's been...

41:55.320 --> 42:01.000
{y:i}... that he can understand where he's going,
{y:i}I fear Agent Mulder may lose his course...

42:01.880 --> 42:06.000
{y:i}... and the truths he's seeking from his
{y:i}childhood will continue to evade him...

42:06.400 --> 42:10.000
{y:i}... driving him more dangerously forward
{y:i}in impossible pursuit.
