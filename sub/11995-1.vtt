<i>Imagine you're dead.</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:10.936
<i>Feel yourself go numb.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.506
<i>Start with your fingers.</i>

01:14.508 --> 01:16.809
<i>Move to your hands...</i>

01:16.811 --> 01:18.444
<i>your wrists...</i>

01:18.446 --> 01:20.779

01:20.781 --> 01:25.084
<i>Everything is dead.</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:30.255
<i>If we can imagine
our own deaths</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:33.125
<i>but still manage
to come back to life,</i>

01:33.127 --> 01:37.763
<i>then it proves that we can
survive anything.</i>

01:40.568 --> 01:43.936
Now, don't be afraid.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.939
Own the moment.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.310
If you're in control,

01:51.312 --> 01:53.812
then the chaos
will happen around you

01:53.814 --> 01:56.348
and not to you.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.650
Do you understand?

01:58.652 --> 02:00.819
The camera's in the hat?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.489
Yeah, it sure is.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.725
Look.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.794
I hope this works.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.865
Oh, three months of prep,
it's going to be perfect.

02:12.867 --> 02:16.268
Okay, I'll punch in
at 9:00, same as always.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.269
Give me 20 minutes.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.804
We should have
a good crowd by then.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.806
Can I taste
the fake blood again, Mom?

02:20.808 --> 02:24.810
No, honey, the bag is sealed.
I don't want to stain my shirt.

Mama, no!

No, Mommy. Don't die.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.414
Mommy!

04:13.621 --> 04:16.255
And for what?

04:16.257 --> 04:17.990
Lollipops?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.494
Mommy loved lollipops.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.335
I'm telling you,
it tastes just like maple syrup.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.071
Sorry, guys. I'm so sorry.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.940
What? I'm hungry.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.208
We skipped breakfast.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.076
You did good.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.478
You did great.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.647
Well done.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.348
Here you go. Come on.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.383
Baxter.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.151
That was my fault.
I broke first.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.053
I'm so sorry.
I'll see you in the car.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.389
- Go.
- Thank you.

04:53.594 --> 04:57.195
What in the fuck is going on?

04:57.197 --> 05:00.732
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:00.734 --> 05:03.635
let this be
your trumpet call.

05:03.637 --> 05:08.140
Life is sweet.

05:08.142 --> 05:12.544
So taste it
while you still can.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.686
Baxter?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.124
Baxter!

07:06.126 --> 07:08.226
I think I found
something!

07:20.908 --> 07:22.507
I mean, it's cruel.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.878
I'm sitting there by myself
because my dad is late, damn it.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.547
What... this is...

07:30.017 --> 07:31.850
Damn it.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.718
It's...

07:33.720 --> 07:35.620
- This is...
- We're getting pretty close.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.989
You should probably
get into your robe.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.724
- My robe?
- We're just about ready

07:39.726 --> 07:41.526
for the next scene,
where you're topless.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.695
Wardrobe should have a robe
set for you in your trailer.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.464
Topless?

07:45.466 --> 07:48.200
No. No.

07:48.202 --> 07:51.069
The script doesn't
mention nudity.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.671
Freeman put it in
this morning.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.907
- Come on. He never mentioned it
to me when we rehearsed it.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.242
In five, everyone.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.111
You look like more
than five minutes out.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.480
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.715
I'm going to be
a lot more than five.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.189
What's up, sunshine?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.225
You want me
to get naked.

08:13.227 --> 08:14.759
Topless.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.762
A guy answers the door,
and I am standing there

08:17.764 --> 08:19.397
with my tits out?

08:19.399 --> 08:23.401
Gina wants to control
the situation.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.737
- With her breasts?
Come on.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.906
I... I never...

08:27.908 --> 08:31.543
would have guessed
that you were so uptight.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.745
You know, it's like, I mean,
Annie Fang.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.847
You know, wild woman.
Indie darling.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.316
Sorry.
Sorry to disappoint you.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.184
You used to...
you used to do anything,

08:40.187 --> 08:41.620
you know, for your roles.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.589
Those aren't stories
I'm proud of, Freeman.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.625
They're just like stupid,
stupid things

08:46.627 --> 08:49.728
that an actor does
when they're too afraid to act.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.396
I know better now.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.131
That's too bad.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.466
What? That I'm older
and wiser?

08:54.468 --> 08:56.201
No, that...
that you've become,

08:56.203 --> 08:58.470
like, so bourgeois,

08:58.472 --> 09:00.639
you know, with those shitty
rom-coms and the...

09:00.641 --> 09:02.274
Okay, that's it.
That's it, we're done.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.175
You need to leave.
You need to leave.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.512
- I'm just trying to help you.
- I'm not doing it.

09:09.550 --> 09:12.217
I want to show
the world that...

09:12.219 --> 09:14.219
that you are still
a legitimate actress.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.687
- Uh-huh.
Thanks, Freeman.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.089
As brave and fearless
as you've always...

09:18.091 --> 09:20.425
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.530
I know what I am
asking you to do is difficult.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.531
Mm-hmm.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.901
But great art
is always difficult!

09:47.988 --> 09:50.522
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

09:54.194 --> 09:55.860
<i>Own the moment.</i>

09:57.397 --> 09:59.497
<i>If you're in control,</i>

09:59.499 --> 10:02.667

10:02.669 --> 10:04.936
<i>and not to you.</i>

10:06.506 --> 10:08.473
<i>Do you understand?</i>

10:21.421 --> 10:23.388
Did they not send a robe
for the walk?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.423
- I don't need one.
I'm in control.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.393
Let's get this fucking scene
over with.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.628
Fantastic.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.763
All right, here we go,
everyone.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.917
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.656
Mmm...

11:02.295 --> 11:03.795
How much is that?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.130
Two dollars.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.898
That's five.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.669
I've got these for this.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.804
And a good thing I only
did about a dollar, okay?

11:12.806 --> 11:16.875
So that's... all that's yours,
and this and this.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.077
Mine, yeah?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.852
- How you doing, Harold?
<i>- Hey, Baxter. How are things?</i>

11:27.854 --> 11:31.356
Well, the book is not done,
if that's what you're asking.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.058
But I'm working on it
every day.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.326
<i>You know it was two years
overdue last month, right?</i>

11:35.328 --> 11:36.895
I do.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.697
<i>You know they're losing
patience, right?</i>

11:38.699 --> 11:40.398
- I'm sure they are.
Listen, if you're calling

11:40.400 --> 11:41.733
to make me feel bad,
you've done it,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.401
and we can hang up now, okay?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.937
<i>- No. I might have a job.</i>

11:45.939 --> 11:47.639
- Yeah? For me?

11:47.641 --> 11:50.542
<i>- Nothing big. Just a story
for a men's magazine.</i>

11:50.544 --> 11:54.045
<i>Do you know
what a potato gun is?</i>

11:54.047 --> 11:57.248
You hit it with the
hair spray, about 1 1/2 count.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.718
- Hair spray, huh?
- Yeah.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.119
Seal it up.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.155
Screw that on real tight.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.423
Lock her up.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.858
Raise the weapon.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.060
- This is about to get good.
- Aim, fire.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.435
Come on.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.871
Don't it smell like
french fries?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.406
A little bit.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.007
You guys come out here
quite a bit, do you?

12:23.009 --> 12:25.577
Oh, ever night, unless there's
something good on TV.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.512
- Right.
- Understandable.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.681
Okay, Lois Lane.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.616
We call this baby
Air Force One.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.817
- All right.
- We're not going to pretend

12:32.819 --> 12:34.385
that it's better than sex,

12:34.387 --> 12:37.489
but this is going
to make you very happy.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.691
- Whoa!
- Look at that!

12:39.693 --> 12:41.392
Come on. Come on,
you're a natural, man.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.962
- Look at you.
- I get it.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.698
That's got a lot of character.
Give me one more of those.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.134
Give me that, man.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.270
One more of those.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.593
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

13:15.595 --> 13:17.962
<i>Own the moment.</i>

13:28.041 --> 13:30.508
<i>You understand?</i>

13:30.510 --> 13:33.178
Okay. I'm ready.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.555
One more!

13:43.557 --> 13:45.123
One more.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.425
- What? Don't be crazy.
- No. No, no.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.893
No, don't push your luck.

13:48.895 --> 13:51.329
- I'll do it.
- Let's do it. You do it.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.693
- Stay with us, pal.
- What's going on?

14:21.695 --> 14:23.194
We're headed to the hospital,
Baxter,

14:23.196 --> 14:24.996
but I need you to talk to us,
buddy. Can you do that?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.764
Baxter, can you do that, buddy?
- I shot you in the head.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.099
- Huh? Yeah.
What do you want me to say?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.634
- Doesn't matter.
Tell us anything.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.869
Tell us about
what you're writing.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.504
I am, uh...
I got a new book,

14:33.506 --> 14:34.973
but I'm a little
writer's blocked.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.507
Oh, well,
maybe we can help you out.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.243
What's it called?

14:38.245 --> 14:41.546
It's called, uh...
"Children's Pit."

14:41.548 --> 14:43.181
Well, what's it about?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.650
It's about these two kids...
a brother and a sister,

14:45.652 --> 14:46.985
and they run away
from an orphanage.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.621
But they get caught
by a pit master.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.789
- Well, what's that?
- It's just a guy

14:51.791 --> 14:53.424
who has an arena underground

14:53.426 --> 14:55.994
and forces them
to fight for sport.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.263
Do they escape?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.832
- I don't know. I don't know.
I haven't gotten that far.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.034
- Let me just take a little nap.
- No, no, no!

15:03.036 --> 15:04.936
What's going on
with my ear?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.437
It really hurts.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.872
Perforated eardrum.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.441
You'll be fine
in a few weeks.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.778
No flying for a while,
though.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.650
Did you say no flying?

15:18.652 --> 15:20.685
That's what I said.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.955
You'll feel better
when your people get here.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.627
- What does that mean?
I don't have any people.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.262
Well, we went through
your wallet.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.997
Standard procedure.

15:32.999 --> 15:37.135
The doctor called your parents.
They're driving up to get you.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.138
No, no.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.307
No, no. Miss?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.145
Miss?

15:51.384 --> 15:53.451

16:06.333 --> 16:10.902
<i>Caleb Fang walked through
a crowded roller skating rink</i>

16:10.904 --> 16:13.371
<i>carrying his infant daughter.</i>

16:13.373 --> 16:16.140
<i>Suddenly, a series of homemade
flare-like devices</i>

16:16.142 --> 16:20.078
<i>he had taped to his back
began to discharge.</i>

16:20.080 --> 16:24.282
<i>Camille captured the event
from the rink's second level.</i>

16:25.952 --> 16:29.520
<i>The Fangs simply throw
themselves into a space</i>

16:29.522 --> 16:31.289
<i>as if they were
hand grenades,</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:35.526
<i>and wait for the disruption
to occur.</i>

16:35.528 --> 16:37.729
- Candace Cane!
Give it up!

16:37.731 --> 16:39.831
Whoo!

16:39.833 --> 16:42.000
<i>They seemed to have
no expectations</i>

16:42.002 --> 16:45.603
<i>other than to willfully
cause unrest.</i>

16:56.282 --> 16:59.817
<i>This kind of event
is so rudimentary,</i>

16:59.819 --> 17:02.520
<i>so unencumbered
by the traditions</i>

17:02.522 --> 17:04.122
<i>that have come before it,</i>

17:04.124 --> 17:06.590
<i>that it almost
strains the notion</i>

17:06.593 --> 17:10.728
<i>of what constitutes art.</i>

17:10.730 --> 17:12.696
- The Fangs.
That's just a gimmick.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.265
That's all that is.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.933
You can... that's not fair.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.836
I mean, you know, whether or not
you like the Fangs' work,

17:18.838 --> 17:21.239
you can't deny
the artistry, certainly.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.608
- What? Of course I can.
That's my job.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.576
Look, the Fangs

17:25.578 --> 17:30.181
pass off these hollow pranks
as if that's enough.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.983
You can say the same thing
about the diggers,

17:31.985 --> 17:34.852
or the situationists,
or the Dadaists for that matter.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.687
But if you care to look
a little deeper,

17:36.689 --> 17:40.291
you'll find that the Fangs
transcend what...

17:40.293 --> 17:42.160
They're not transcending
anything.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.395
- It's just tricks.
- If...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.097
in the... in the pageant piece,

17:46.099 --> 17:47.498
they challenged gender
stereotypes.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.767
In the restaurant piece,
they ask us to look at food

17:49.769 --> 17:52.637
not as sustenance,
but as status or style.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.105
- In some of the early...
- Oh, come on!

17:54.107 --> 17:56.774
Just because... just because
you attach a statement

17:56.776 --> 17:58.943
doesn't make it art,
you know?

17:58.945 --> 18:02.246
You can call it art
but real art requires

18:02.248 --> 18:04.382
an aesthetic intelligence.
- But that ambiguity

18:04.384 --> 18:06.184
is what makes it
interesting.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.020
Is it art or is it a joke?
Is it profound or is it a prank?

18:09.022 --> 18:11.289
Are they geniuses
or charlatans?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.891
These are the questions
that they want us to ask.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.460
Well, they're not
too hard to answer.

18:15.462 --> 18:18.096
And the Fangs are challenging
the very nature of art itself.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.597
I don't think they are.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.266
They embrace everything
that's wonderful about art,

18:22.268 --> 18:25.269
and they subvert it
at the same time.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.339
They are deeply serious
class clowns who celebrate...

18:28.341 --> 18:30.741
"Clowns" is right, yeah.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.978
I'm sorry.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.847
What were you saying?

18:35.849 --> 18:39.117
I... I think what they're doing
is wonderful.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.720
Well, I guess... I guess I just
don't get it.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.858
Well, that's pretty obvious.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.894
So the truth is
making a movie is really...

18:49.896 --> 18:52.330
it's a strange process,
you know?

18:52.332 --> 18:56.367
Always requires some sort
of degree of weirdness.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.370
Is that why
you took off your top?

19:00.907 --> 19:03.574
I took off my top
because...

19:03.576 --> 19:07.678
well, because I wanted to prove
to myself that I could do it.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.350
I've never done a nude scene
before, so what the hell, right?

19:15.355 --> 19:18.055
Did Sally tell you
that this was...

19:19.225 --> 19:22.059
This is a very important
article for me.

19:22.061 --> 19:25.062
- No, she didn't. I know.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.397
Yeah.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.534
They say I'm in a bit of a...
I don't know.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.837
Precarious position
right now career-wise,

19:32.839 --> 19:35.940
and then I have to,
I don't know...

19:35.942 --> 19:37.808
but I'm not stable.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.211
You don't have to worry
about that.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.280
Thank you, but I do.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.748
Obviously I do.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.283
Well, you can relax,

19:45.285 --> 19:48.186
because I don't care
about your meltdowns.

19:50.156 --> 19:53.724
I'm actually more interested
in your family.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.460
It's okay.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.229
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.431
- I'll get you another.
- Thank you very much.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.699
Um...

20:01.701 --> 20:03.968
you're not going to put that
in the article, I hope.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.604
- How could I leave it out?
- Oh, shit.

20:06.606 --> 20:10.141
Are you always so jumpy when
someone mentions your parents?

20:10.143 --> 20:12.810
It doesn't come up often,
actually.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.779
- Really?
But they're famous.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.314
Well, not really.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.316
In certain circles, I suppose.
But...

20:18.318 --> 20:21.152
I wrote my thesis
on their work.

20:21.154 --> 20:23.487
You're kidding.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.823
Wow.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.225
Great.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.427
That's why I wanted
to do this story.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.095
Huh.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.586
Do you think you'll ever do
another piece with them?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.437
No.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.638
God no.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.975
Thanks.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.312
It must have been fun, though.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.580
Come on.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.082
Being child A?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.384
- Yeah, of course.
But I'm not a child anymore.

20:55.288 --> 20:58.723
Anyway, your readers don't want
to hear about this.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.559
They don't want to hear
about weirdo performance art.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.128
Look, I think you're
a great actress.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.696
But the artist you are,

21:05.698 --> 21:09.066
don't you think she was
already there in child A?

21:09.068 --> 21:13.971
The emotion? The joy?
The anarchy?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.773
It's too bad
none of your directors

21:15.775 --> 21:19.443
have known how to channel all
that the way your parents did.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.047
When I was 9 years old...

21:28.121 --> 21:30.855
child A was a role.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.424
It was a role I played.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.293
It's not who I am.

21:37.030 --> 21:40.665
Hey, Baxter.
How are you doing, buddy?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.933
<i>I'm terrible.</i>

21:42.935 --> 21:44.935
Where are you?

21:44.937 --> 21:46.237
<i>I'm in upstate New York.</i>

21:46.239 --> 21:48.906
Mmm, yeah, that is terrible.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.241
What are you doing up there?

21:50.243 --> 21:52.243
<i>I got shot in the head.</i>

21:53.212 --> 21:54.612
What did you say?

21:54.614 --> 21:57.315
- I got shot in the head.
But I'm okay.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.716
I'm...

21:58.718 --> 22:01.352
well, I'm not okay.
I'm in a hospital.

22:01.354 --> 22:03.621
But, you know,
I'm not dying, so...

22:03.623 --> 22:05.589
<i>You got shot in the head?</i>

22:05.591 --> 22:07.024
I did.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.393
<i>- Well, who?
Who shot you in the head?</i>

22:09.395 --> 22:12.363
- Just this guy.
And it was a potato.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.564
<i>Baxter...</i>

22:13.566 --> 22:15.399
It's not why
I'm calling, though.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.935
- Come on, are you on drugs?
Are you?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.470
<i>Yeah. Percocet, mostly.</i>

22:19.472 --> 22:22.173
- Mm-hmm. Would you call me back
when you're lucid?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.474
<i>- No, no, Annie.
Don't hang up.</i>

22:23.476 --> 22:25.776
- Come on, Baxter...
<i>- The doctors</i>

22:25.778 --> 22:27.378
<i>will not let me leave.</i>

22:27.380 --> 22:31.349
<i>And Mom and Dad are bringing me
home to recuperate.</i>

22:33.486 --> 22:34.919
- What?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:34.921 --> 22:37.588
<i>Mom and Dad are on their way.
You got to come get me.</i>

22:37.590 --> 22:40.658
Look, I'm in my pajamas
and I'm 3,000 miles away.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.227
- I can't do that.
<i>- Well, I can't go back home.</i>

22:43.229 --> 22:45.763
<i>I can't go back home
by myself.</i>

22:45.765 --> 22:48.099
All right. Um...

22:48.101 --> 22:49.767
I'm going to help you out,

22:49.769 --> 22:52.570
but I'm just... I need a day
to sort a few things out.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.473
I'm in a really weird place
right now.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.875
Are you in a weird place,
Annie?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.710
I almost got killed
by a potato.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.979
- Would you just relax?
I'm sending you a plane ticket.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.280
You can come
and stay with me.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.082
No, no, I can't fly, Annie.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.618
<i>So tell them you can't go.</i>

23:07.620 --> 23:09.387
<i>Just stand up
to them, Baxter.</i>

23:09.389 --> 23:11.489
When have I ever done that?

23:15.461 --> 23:18.562
No answer, right?
Because I've never done it.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.064
Thanks a lot, Annie.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.035
<i>The point is,
I call in a favor.</i>

23:25.037 --> 23:27.304
<i>I line up this guy
from "Esquire."</i>

23:27.306 --> 23:29.240
And you decide
to nail him?

23:29.242 --> 23:32.243
- No, I didn't decide it.
Just... it happened.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.577
That's the problem, Annie.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.013
These things shouldn't
just happened.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.215
- I know.
- You could get away with this

23:38.217 --> 23:39.683
a few years ago, okay?

23:39.685 --> 23:42.019
Everybody likes a little
shoplifting with their starlet.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.021
A little DUI here and again.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.222
It's kind of cute.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.291
- Come on, I stopped that.
Done.

23:47.293 --> 23:50.060
Yes, there was a nice lull
in the middle years, you know?

23:50.062 --> 23:51.462
Nice and quiet.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.898
But things are starting
to get a little loopy again.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.033
You know? And I know the good
offers aren't coming in.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.169
But you can't panic
about it.

23:58.171 --> 24:00.104
I can get back on track.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.273
I can, Sally.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.708
I don't think you can.

24:04.710 --> 24:08.712
You know, you have the impulse
control of a 2-year-old.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.714
Look...

24:12.685 --> 24:14.018
Were you drinking again?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.653
No.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.290
Listen, if you are,
I know a couple places.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.225
I'm not drinking.
I just... I need a project.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.828
I mean, what about the start
date on "Powers the Bee 3"?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.262
Have we got that yet?

24:26.666 --> 24:29.033
You're going to have to talk
to Gordon about that.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.267
Why?

24:30.269 --> 24:32.102
- Why? Because he's your agent.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.338
I think you should
hear it from him.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.674
- Hear what?
- Oh, God.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.309
What?

24:38.311 --> 24:42.246
They offered "Lady Lightning"
to Alison Cane.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.184
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.322
Well, that's a bummer.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.823
- Come on, Annie.
Look at this as a good thing.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.125
You don't have to wear
that ridiculous costume anymore.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.360
I love that costume.

24:56.362 --> 24:59.096
- Ugh!
We'll get you a better one.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.332
In the meantime,

25:01.334 --> 25:04.034
I think you need
to take a step back.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.171
I think you just have to have
a real sit-down with yourself.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.975
I don't even know
what that means.

to perform. What's your problem?

25:48.414 --> 25:50.180
- Be quiet.
Let those kids be.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.750
- Let the kids perform.
- I mean, this is... bad.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.319
This is horrible.
I'm sorry. You suck.

25:55.321 --> 25:58.322
- No, he's right.
You guys are awful.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.790
She knows what
she's talking about.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.659
You should learn
how to play your instruments,

26:01.661 --> 26:03.260
not just hold them
and pound them.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.229
We can't afford lessons.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.730
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I hurt your feelings?

26:06.732 --> 26:08.532
Because I want to kill myself,
it's that bad.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.901
You're probably killing
your dog with your music.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.670
This will be great
for my documentary on crap.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.438
- All right, keep playing, kids.
Keep playing.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.739
- Do not listen to them.
- What, you like this?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.708
You need to get
your ears checked, blondie.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.709
You like these kids?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.144
I hope you don't have
any kids.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.846
I hope your uterus
shriveled up!

26:22.848 --> 26:25.482
- No, I'm not taking this.
- Give me the camera.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.117
You have to get it.
Give me the camera.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.752
- There you go.
That's the show.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.187
That's the show.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.523
Oh, yeah!

26:32.525 --> 26:34.191
Nice.

26:35.528 --> 26:38.796
Oh! Oh, you were awful.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.331
- Awful!
- Awful!

26:40.333 --> 26:42.666
- I have never heard...
- Camera and the footage

26:42.668 --> 26:43.801
all destroyed.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.769
But I don't care!
I don't care.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.672
That was just for us.
You were amazing.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.407
I have never been prouder.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.042
♪ Kill all the parents ♪

26:52.044 --> 26:53.611
♪ So you can keep living ♪

26:53.613 --> 26:57.081
♪ Kill them, kill them,
kill them, kill them ♪

26:57.083 --> 26:58.882
Yeah!

27:17.136 --> 27:19.303
- Sorry we're late. Sorry.
- You're late.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.373
- I had a sign and everything.
You had to get your own bag.

27:23.376 --> 27:24.642
Thank you for coming.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.243
Well, we're going
to take care of you.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.278
Yeah. You need
taking care of too?

27:28.280 --> 27:29.813
- Yeah.
- You okay?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.081
How's your ear?

27:31.083 --> 27:34.251
It's... it's better
than it was yesterday.

27:34.253 --> 27:37.187
- Oh, God.
- Look at these two.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.889
- Hey.
- Welcome home.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.025
- Look at how skinny you are.
- What's with the bandages?

27:41.027 --> 27:43.027
Well, did you see
your brother's ear?

27:43.029 --> 27:44.595
We wanted to play along.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.563
Oh, you look
so beautiful.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.132
- We brought you a neck brace.
Look at this.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.800
- Oh, oh, here.
- Come on.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.569
- I'm not putting that on.
- Brand-new. Never been used.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.011
<i>So, hey, what's the plan?</i>

28:01.013 --> 28:02.312
<i>Daddy.</i>

28:02.314 --> 28:05.215
- Sorry, Annie.
What's the plan, Annie?

28:05.217 --> 28:07.718
- I don't know.
I'm just here for Baxter.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.453
Oh, we're all here for Baxter.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.588
- Whatever Baxter needs.
- This is a place of healing.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.357
- Mm-hmm.
- That's great.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.259
I just need someone
to take me shopping.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.928
Not a lot of great options
in your closet, Dad.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.430
Go lighter on those pills,
sweetheart.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.266
My ear hurts pretty bad, Mom.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.767
What about you?

28:23.769 --> 28:26.737
Anything you're itching to do
while you're back?

28:26.739 --> 28:29.640
Mm, I'm just going
to take it easy.

28:29.642 --> 28:32.743
Do a little yoga.
Some reflection.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.612
- Ooh, reflection.
- Yeah.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.381
Apparently I have some
bad habits that I have to break.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.316
Don't do that.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.219
Your bad habits
are my favorite thing about you.

28:42.221 --> 28:45.389
Yeah, but I think that's part
of the problem, Daddy.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.391
Hey, speaking of,

28:47.393 --> 28:48.692
we saw your titty shots.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.261
- Holy shit.
- They were wonderful.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.963
Jesus Christ.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.033
Hey, it's about time you
started playing with the idea

28:56.035 --> 29:00.471
of celebrity in the female form
as viewed objects.

29:00.473 --> 29:01.939
That's not what
I was doing.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.408
Of course it is,
whether you know it or not.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.410
You could take the girl
out of the art,

29:06.412 --> 29:10.781
but you cannot take the art
out of the girl.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.150
Well...

29:13.152 --> 29:14.618
I'm still an artist, Daddy.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.886
That's what I just said.

29:15.888 --> 29:17.755
- Yeah, actors.
Actors are artists.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.657
- Yes. Didn't I say
I like your titty shot?

29:20.659 --> 29:22.092
We both liked them
very much.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.394
You have beautiful breasts,
sweetheart.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.896
Okay, that's it!

29:25.898 --> 29:27.765
Can we not talk about
the titty shots anymore, please?

29:27.767 --> 29:30.434
And we can stop saying
titty shots, everybody.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.770
To Fangs.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.106
Together again.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.375
That's how it should be.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.478
Waited a long time for this.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.180
Cheers.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.049
Titty shots.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.019
Titty.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.420
- Titty.
- Dad.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.122
- Titty!
- Ugh, Dad...

29:52.124 --> 29:53.844
Ridiculous.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.544
I was better back then.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.782
- It was so simple.
- Yeah.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.527
They just told us
what to do.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.732
When did it get
so complicated?

30:40.739 --> 30:42.639
Don't you know?

30:44.977 --> 30:46.176
No.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.245
- Smother Beach.
Come here.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.113
Smother Beach.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.517
Baxter...

30:54.954 --> 30:57.855
You never sold the urgency
in this one.

30:57.857 --> 31:00.891
Thank God your sister
improvised a bit.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.393
Your mother nearly died
out there.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.963
Baxter was perfect.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.898
Perfect.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.701
What do you got on?

31:12.304 --> 31:14.571
Mind your business.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.273
I'll make popcorn!

31:16.275 --> 31:17.275
Thank you.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.880
Got something going on
upstairs, huh?

31:22.882 --> 31:25.382
Well, we can
pick it up later.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.652
Nobody told me
it was movie night.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.457
Put another one on
just for the hell of it.

31:33.459 --> 31:34.958
Oh, that's better.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.930
Why are we doing this?

31:39.932 --> 31:43.667
Because need to behave
like healthy people.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.068
It's called acting.

31:45.070 --> 31:48.038
You know? You want to look,
you act the part

31:48.040 --> 31:49.706
before you know
you are that person.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.141
What person?

31:51.143 --> 31:53.477
That person who doesn't
screw things up.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.445
Which means no more Percocet
for you.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.914
No more booze for me.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.548
Yeah, you think
you can do that?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.284
Oh, yeah.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.021
I thought it was nice
last night.

32:04.023 --> 32:07.691
Looking at those old pieces
sitting on the couch together.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.295
What?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.596
You don't see it,
do you?

32:12.598 --> 32:14.431
See what?

32:14.433 --> 32:15.899
Being seduced
by your own parents,

32:15.901 --> 32:17.534
which I think
is kind of gross.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.636
Come on, you're ridiculous.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.171
Let's turn back.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.440
Mom wants us to run
some errands with her.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.775
You think I'm being
ridiculous, huh?

32:24.777 --> 32:26.109
- Yeah.
- You didn't see that?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.245
You didn't pick up
on any of that?

32:28.247 --> 32:29.546
- No.
- Come on.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.948
What kind of errands?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.883
I want to do some yoga
after this.

32:32.885 --> 32:34.318
- Let's go.
Let's run uphill.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.553
You want to be that person,
that person runs uphill.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.121
Come on.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.223
Yeah, I'll...
I'll run uphill.

32:40.225 --> 32:41.858
- Uh-oh.
- Come on!

32:41.860 --> 32:42.859
Ow.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.261
<i>Mmm, so where are we going?</i>

32:44.263 --> 32:45.796
<i>To the amusement park.</i>

32:45.798 --> 32:47.831
We're running an errand
at the amusement park?

32:47.833 --> 32:49.333
Why are we going there?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.902
The Denver MCA wants me
to create a new piece.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.437
I haven't heard from them
in years,

32:53.439 --> 32:56.506
and when we realized
that you'd both be home...

32:56.508 --> 32:58.208
Needless to say,
they were very excited.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.377
- We're doing a piece?
- Annie, Annie, put this on.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.112
- Oh.
- What did I tell you?

33:02.114 --> 33:03.313
What is this?

33:03.315 --> 33:04.748
It's a shirt, honey.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.817
And you need to wear it,
or the event won't work.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.553
All you have to do is hand out
these fake coupons, huh?

33:09.555 --> 33:11.888
- Yeah.
- For chicken sandwiches.

33:11.890 --> 33:14.391
And when we're doing that,
Baxter will film all the people

33:14.393 --> 33:16.493
at the counter
demanding free food.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.729
Then I rally
the angry customers,

33:18.731 --> 33:20.430
I get them to storm
the counters.

33:20.432 --> 33:21.832
It'll be a thing of beauty.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.767
I don't think
this is a good idea.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.002
- It's not a good idea.
- No.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.370
What are you talking about?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.838
It's going to be fun,
like old times.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.272
You're going
to be brilliant.

33:29.274 --> 33:31.208
Yeah, what about when
they recognize Annie?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.342
We brought a disguise.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.211
Annie's going to wear
a disguise?

33:34.213 --> 33:36.546
- That's a good one. I can't.
- That stinks, Mom.

33:36.548 --> 33:37.781
- Baxter.
- Yeah?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.049
- Stay out of this.
- Okay.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.617
If the tabloids
get a hold of this,

33:40.619 --> 33:42.185
it will be terrible for me.
- Exactly right.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.788
Who cares? You shouldn't be
in that business anyway.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.423
- What?
- Please don't say that.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.058
Well, you've been at it
for 20 years.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.693
What have you got
to show for it?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.762
A bunch of crap movies
and a tampon commercial.

33:51.764 --> 33:53.630
- Caleb, be nice.
- Oh, my God, Dad.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.066
- Was it not a tampon campaign?
- It was.

33:56.068 --> 33:59.369
Absorb all the good things in
life and leave the rest to us.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.538
- Okay, come on.
- That's a terrible tag line.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.107
- Just trying to make a living.
- I'm giving you an opportunity

34:04.109 --> 34:06.676
- to be artists again.
- Okay, we've been over this.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.245
A and B are still artists.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.347
Please don't call us
A and B, Mom.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.849
"Please don't
call us artists," you mean.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.152
- Caleb!
- I'm sorry, your popcorn flicks

34:15.154 --> 34:17.687
and Baxter's emo crap fiction
is not art.

34:17.688 --> 34:18.889
It's garbage.

34:18.891 --> 34:20.290
What is wrong with him?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.525
Dad?

34:21.527 --> 34:23.126
Caleb, can I just say

34:23.128 --> 34:25.629
you forget, I've seen
the reviews of the masterpieces

34:25.630 --> 34:27.297
you and Mom have been
churning out.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.998
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.
- No, this...

34:29.001 --> 34:30.734
He needs to hear this.
- No, no. Annie, drop it.

34:30.735 --> 34:34.137
- All right? Let's talk about
the water balloon thing. Huh?

34:34.139 --> 34:36.106
- Yeah.
- Let's talk about

34:36.108 --> 34:39.842
the disastrous
wife-abusive piece.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.210
What about the epileptic
and the...

34:41.213 --> 34:43.213
- Oh, my God. The epileptic
in the antique shop.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.014
- That was distasteful, Mom.
- Okay, all right, we get it.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.750
We get it, the pieces
aren't the same without you.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.984
- We know that.
- They're not.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.518
- Oh, no, they're not.
- No.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.254
- That's why we're doing this.
- Shove it!

34:51.255 --> 34:52.755
Shove it up your ass!

34:52.757 --> 34:54.190
We don't need you.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.759
Your mother and I,
we'll do it ourselves.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.494
We've done it that way
for years.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.296
We're trying to be nice.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.398
Thought you might want
to feel part of it again.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.201
But to hell with you both.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.369
Baxter, could you at least
work the camera?

35:06.371 --> 35:07.871
But you still want me
to film it?

35:07.873 --> 35:09.539
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah, grudgingly.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.675
Yeah, you're damn right
it's going to be grudgingly.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.176
- Yeah. Go ahead.
- No.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.512
Even though it's all
been shoved up my ass.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.947
No...

35:20.452 --> 35:22.018
This is horrible.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.087
It's really tough to watch.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.622
I mean, I knew he didn't
like my movies,

35:25.624 --> 35:28.258
but I had no idea
that he hated them.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.627
What he hates is that
he needs us.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.462
Without us,
their work sucks.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.931
That's what he hates.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.333
I'm sorry to bother you.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.467
Oh, it's fine.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.503
- Would you like me to sign...
- Baxter?

35:39.505 --> 35:42.105
Suzanne. Suzanne Crosby?

35:42.107 --> 35:44.307
- Oh, yeah. You left a message.
How's it going?

35:44.309 --> 35:45.909
We went to high school
together.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.377
- Yeah. It's okay
if you don't remember me.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.479
No, I do, I do,
now that I'm looking at you.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.882
- Your hair used to be...
- Oh, God, yeah.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.216
And you had a bunch
of piercings, am I right?

35:53.218 --> 35:56.119
- Yeah, yeah.
I still do have a couple.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.522
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.290
I hope this isn't
too weird.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.293
You know, I just... I saw you,
happened to be here.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.395
So I just thought
I'd say hello.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.997
She's got a writing class
she wants me to come to.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.132
Well, you heard.
This is my sister, Annie.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.034
- Hi. I don't mean
to be pushy.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.602
- You're not.
- I just think the students

36:12.604 --> 36:14.137
would love
to hear you speak,

36:14.139 --> 36:17.374
you being from the area and
making such a name for yourself.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.942
Oh, I don't know
about that.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.410
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.279
- Say yes.
- Yeah!

36:22.281 --> 36:23.880
- Say yes.
- I'm thinking about it.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.549
- Let me...
- Come on.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.850
Well, you know, no pressure.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.919
I'm easy, so just...

36:28.921 --> 36:30.387
you have the information.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.189
Yeah, I'll get a hold
of you.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.390
I'll...

36:33.392 --> 36:34.391
it was good to see you.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.792
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good to see you.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.494
- Good to see you too.
- Bye.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.429
She's adorable.

36:39.431 --> 36:40.897
Yeah.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.632
Oh, look alive.

36:42.634 --> 36:43.900
They hooked one.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.238
That poor cashier.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.074
She doesn't get paid enough
to handle this.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.712
Oh, shit.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.014
He's giving it to him.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.516
- What is that?
She's giving him a sandwich.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.451
- She thinks it's real?
- I don't know.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.553
She thinks it's real.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.924
Okay, see what happens.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.195
She gave it to them.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.364
What the hell?

37:14.366 --> 37:16.466
What the hell is going on here?
You can't rely on anybody

37:16.468 --> 37:19.736
these days to make a proper
piece of art.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.471
Give me one of those.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.613
Hello.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.914
Hi.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.550
- I'd like one free sandwich,
please.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.418
Sure thing.
Here you go.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.755
- Thank you.
Wait, don't I need a coupon?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.156
Okay.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.861
Now, I got this from
some shady-looking characters

37:44.863 --> 37:46.463
over by the Orange Julius.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.332
It doesn't seem
on the up and up.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.835
No, it's good.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.136
I think that's fake.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.671
I don't think so.

37:54.673 --> 37:55.872
It is, though.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.107
I want you to look at it
for two seconds;

37:57.109 --> 37:58.642
you tell me if that's real.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.705
Do you want the sandwich
or not?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.215
Let me talk
to your manager.

38:05.217 --> 38:06.449
Sure.

38:06.451 --> 38:10.253
Charlie, can you come
over here for a second?

38:10.255 --> 38:13.156
- Hi. What can I do
for you?

38:16.128 --> 38:18.295
Is the manager
not at work today?

38:18.297 --> 38:20.857
- Oh, no, he is.
You got him.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.000
That coupon is fake.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.569
- Oh.
No, it's fine, sir.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.571
Have you looked at it?

38:28.573 --> 38:30.840
- I did. It's official.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.809
It's not official.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.411
It does not look
to be official to me.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.612
That's a fake.

38:35.614 --> 38:38.448
And you've handed out
all these free sandwiches

38:38.450 --> 38:39.516
for counterfeit coupons?

38:39.518 --> 38:42.352
You're a fool,
and your people are fools.

38:42.354 --> 38:43.953
Sir, please just
take your free sandwich

38:43.955 --> 38:45.422
and step out of line.

38:45.424 --> 38:48.825
I wouldn't eat that shit
sandwich if you paid me.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.227
Okay, sir,
I will call the police.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.496
You have the tiniest
responsibility.

38:53.498 --> 38:56.099
You just have to do your job.
I do the rest.

38:56.101 --> 38:59.502
All you have to do
is let that thing happen.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.205
What is wrong with people
these days?

39:02.207 --> 39:04.441
I do the work,
you get to witness the beauty.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.110
That's all you had to...
stop that!

39:07.112 --> 39:09.346
You don't record me.
I record you.

39:09.348 --> 39:12.048
This is supposed to be art.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.316
Not some YouTube video.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.617
Honey, let's just leave.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.586
Didn't I say
this would happen?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.221
You thought they'd solve
everything.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.423
They've only made things worse.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.327
- You did this. Hey!

39:24.329 --> 39:25.895
Hey!

39:25.897 --> 39:27.097
You! You did this!

39:27.099 --> 39:29.532
Okay, honey, let's go.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.174
<i>I think they're losing it.</i>

39:38.176 --> 39:39.576
<i>Their artistic sensibility?</i>

39:39.578 --> 39:42.345
- No, their minds. They're...
- Yeah.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.948
I mean, he's always had

39:44.950 --> 39:46.916
an odd idea
of what constituted art.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.285
But come on,
that was almost silly.

39:49.287 --> 39:52.188
Did he really think he could
lead a coup on a Chicken Queen?

39:52.190 --> 39:53.890
I don't know.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.595
Maybe we should have
helped them.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.029
- Help them?
- Yeah.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.899
No, Annie, come on.
Absolutely not.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.567
They're struggling.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.702
We all are.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.570
Well, it's not the same,
though.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.272
Besides, helping them
wouldn't solve anything.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.508
It would turn us back into kids.
Is that what you want?

40:11.510 --> 40:12.809
Hey.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.744
Your father and I have decided
to go to the Berkshires

40:14.746 --> 40:16.112
for a few days.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.014
- Berkshires, huh? Great.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.749
- When?
- Tonight.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.118
Is this because
of the Chicken Queen?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.187
What a disaster.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.791
Great art's always difficult,
though, right?

40:29.761 --> 40:32.295
What'd you say?

40:32.297 --> 40:34.097
I just said what you
always tell us.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.498
That great art's
always difficult.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.833
Do me a favor.

40:36.835 --> 40:40.336
Don't talk about things
you know nothing about.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.106
- Okay. Deal.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.366
I found something weird.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.073
That is weird.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.375
There's like a hundred of
these in the back of my closet.

41:19.377 --> 41:22.178
What do you think they are?

41:22.180 --> 41:24.147
I don't know.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.849
Maybe a fan sent them?

41:25.851 --> 41:27.183
I mean, remember that lady

41:27.185 --> 41:30.353
who sent all those teeth
in the Ziploc bags?

41:30.355 --> 41:31.821
They're actually
kind of great.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.289
I mean, look at the detail.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.391
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

41:35.393 --> 41:37.994
- Nothing.
- Don't look at those.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.296
Oh, no. Shit.

41:40.298 --> 41:43.299
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.168
- What's wrong?
- I... I don't know.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.237
God damn it.

41:47.239 --> 41:50.006
Where did these paintings
come from?

41:50.008 --> 41:51.441
They're mine.

41:51.443 --> 41:53.943
- They're yours?
- You did these?

41:53.945 --> 41:55.245
Yes, I did.

41:55.247 --> 41:57.647
Since when did you
start painting, Mom?

41:57.649 --> 42:01.117
How do you think
I got into art school?

42:01.119 --> 42:03.386
I stopped when I met Daddy.

42:03.388 --> 42:05.688
So he doesn't know
about these?

42:05.690 --> 42:07.590
Oh, good God, no.

42:07.592 --> 42:10.159
If he ever found out
that I started painting again,

42:10.161 --> 42:12.595
that'd be such a betrayal.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.533
Why is this door locked?

42:16.535 --> 42:18.735
We're... we're talking.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.603
About what?

42:20.605 --> 42:22.772
Our feelings.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.342
Meet me in the car.

42:28.880 --> 42:33.116
- I want you to have these.
Here, that's for you.

42:33.118 --> 42:35.251
That's for you.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.956
Now, promise me that if I die
before your father,

42:39.958 --> 42:43.693
you'll get rid
of all the others.

42:45.297 --> 42:46.896
So let's...
let's put these back.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.364
They're amazing.

42:48.366 --> 42:51.200
Oh, they're just paintings.

42:51.202 --> 42:54.137
They're pretty great, Mom.

42:54.139 --> 42:55.872
Yeah, thank you.

42:59.311 --> 43:00.743
The fridge is full,

43:00.745 --> 43:05.548
so you are welcome
to whatever is in there.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.350
- Thanks, Mom.
Have fun.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.285
- Thanks.
- Give me a kiss.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.291
Drive safe, Dad.

43:15.293 --> 43:17.527
- Yup.
- You look after your brother.

43:17.529 --> 43:19.395
It's only going to be
a couple of days.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.264
- I know.
- I'll be fine.

43:21.266 --> 43:22.899
Bye, Daddy.

43:22.901 --> 43:25.101
Stay out of our room.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.537
Will do.

43:30.041 --> 43:32.075
Why is she crying?

43:32.077 --> 43:34.277
She always cries
at good-byes.

43:52.964 --> 43:57.533
♪ I pawned everything ♪

43:59.204 --> 44:01.938
♪ That I had this morning ♪

44:03.274 --> 44:05.675
You know, as awkward
as yesterday was,

44:05.677 --> 44:07.610
I really think
I've cleared a hurdle.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.979
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.248
I was thinking about what...

44:12.250 --> 44:14.484
what that stupid
"Esquire" guy said.

44:14.486 --> 44:16.486
That every time I make a...
I don't know,

44:16.488 --> 44:17.987
make a mess of things,

44:17.989 --> 44:20.189
I'm just doing exactly
what child A always did.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.359
But when I think about,
it pissed me off that he was...

44:23.361 --> 44:24.961
That he was right
on the money, right?

44:24.963 --> 44:26.896
Exactly, Baxter.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.765
He was right on the money.

44:28.767 --> 44:31.200
And yesterday
I didn't do that.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.736
Mm-mm, child A
stood up to them.

44:33.738 --> 44:35.772
And that's thanks
to child B, right?

44:35.774 --> 44:37.473
Yeah.

44:37.475 --> 44:39.042
We're helping each other.

44:39.044 --> 44:41.144
We're breaking old patterns.

44:41.146 --> 44:43.579
Like a couple
of Dr. Phils.

44:44.582 --> 44:46.349
We're getting better.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.117
Come on,
I haven't had a drink.

44:48.119 --> 44:49.852
You haven't had a pill.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.521
Well, oops.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.790
- Baxter.
- My ear hurt.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.458
Anyway, but something's
working.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.093
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

44:57.095 --> 45:00.029
And when Mom and Dad realize
that we're not kids anymore,

45:00.031 --> 45:01.297
which they have to do,

45:01.299 --> 45:04.901
we could have
a healthy family.

45:04.903 --> 45:06.302
Healthy life.

45:06.304 --> 45:08.805
Do healthy things together.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.239
Take a trip.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.941
Grand Canyon.

45:11.943 --> 45:13.743
In a Winnebago.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.613
Sounds terrible.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.215
Well, I'm just spitballing.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.884
Come on, don't bring me down.

45:25.090 --> 45:27.523
Good morning, ma'am.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.292
Would you mind coming
down to the station?

45:29.294 --> 45:32.795
There's a situation
we'd like to talk to you about.

45:32.797 --> 45:34.630
Now, the car that is
registered to your parents

45:34.632 --> 45:36.733
was found at a rest stop
on route 22

45:36.735 --> 45:39.035
just before the Massachusetts
border.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.703
They were not with the car,

45:40.705 --> 45:42.371
but there were, I'm afraid,
signs of a struggle,

45:42.373 --> 45:43.840
and quite a bit of blood.

45:43.842 --> 45:45.641
We checked
the security cameras

45:45.643 --> 45:48.578
and interviewed employees
at the surrounding locations.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.780
But we've been unable to come up
with anything conclusive

45:50.782 --> 45:51.781
at this point.

45:51.783 --> 45:53.483
All signs indicate
that your parents

45:53.485 --> 45:55.251
are currently missing,

45:55.253 --> 45:57.520
and we have to suspect
foul play.

45:57.522 --> 45:58.821
I'm sorry, sheriff.

45:58.823 --> 46:01.624
This is... our parents
aren't missing.

46:01.626 --> 46:04.527
They're artists.
It's all a performance.

46:04.529 --> 46:07.730
We know all about
their art things.

46:07.732 --> 46:10.166
But the fact is,
they're missing from a car

46:10.168 --> 46:12.802
that they were driving,
and it's covered in blood.

46:12.804 --> 46:14.704
This is so stupid.

46:14.706 --> 46:17.473
Ma'am, there have been four
rest stop abductions

46:17.475 --> 46:20.042
in the last nine months,
all along route 22,

46:20.044 --> 46:22.078
and all ending in homicides.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.980
Hang on.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.948
Really?

46:27.752 --> 46:29.619
That's not what this is.

46:29.621 --> 46:32.021
Well, let's hope not.

46:34.526 --> 46:36.659
- Let's hope not.
But the crime scene photos

46:36.661 --> 46:40.863
do show some startling
similarities to the other cases.

46:40.865 --> 46:43.966
Would it be possible
for me to have a look at that?

46:43.968 --> 46:46.528
Did you say four
in the last nine months?

46:48.039 --> 46:50.439
And this would be
the fifth or the fourth?

46:51.743 --> 46:53.209
- Jesus Christ.
Let me see that.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.344
- It's fake. Fake blood.
This is what they...

46:55.346 --> 46:56.612
- Can I see it?
- This is what they use

46:56.614 --> 46:58.648
in a lot of their
performances.

46:58.650 --> 47:01.317
The lab will let us know
if that is the case.

47:16.067 --> 47:18.434
You think
they're dead, right?

47:18.436 --> 47:21.003
We don't know that,
but...

47:22.273 --> 47:24.540
it is a possible
scenario, yes.

47:25.844 --> 47:27.643
Our parents are probably
hiding somewhere now,

47:27.645 --> 47:29.011
laughing themselves silly.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.479
And as soon as you say
they're dead,

47:30.481 --> 47:32.014
they're going to pop up
resurrected.

47:32.016 --> 47:34.283
It takes seven years
to pronounce someone dead

47:34.285 --> 47:35.885
without a body in this state.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.420
Are they going to wait
seven years?

47:53.738 --> 47:55.438
Here's another one.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.706
"College student latest victim

47:56.708 --> 47:58.441
in a string
of rest stop murders."

47:58.443 --> 48:00.743
- Mm-hmm. They knew
about the murders.

48:00.745 --> 48:04.380
They built the entire piece
around them.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.048
And do you know
why they did it?

48:06.050 --> 48:08.351
Because we wouldn't
do the Chicken Queen thing.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.552
We're being punished.

48:10.822 --> 48:12.755
"Local man found
in IHOP Dumpster."

48:12.757 --> 48:14.624
Oh, place of healing
my ass.

48:14.626 --> 48:16.292
Staging their own death.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.627
Annie, don't do that.

48:17.629 --> 48:19.161
- Oh, God.
You're right, you're right.

48:19.163 --> 48:21.030
What am I doing?

48:21.032 --> 48:22.932
I'm slipping back.

48:24.435 --> 48:26.168
And you want
to know something?

48:26.170 --> 48:28.004
This is all Caleb.

48:28.006 --> 48:29.105
All Caleb.

48:29.107 --> 48:30.706
That's why Mom was crying
when she left.

48:30.708 --> 48:32.174
She didn't want to go.

48:32.176 --> 48:33.542
Why else would she leave

48:33.544 --> 48:35.011
those paintings
for us to find?

48:35.013 --> 48:37.146
- Well, she didn't.
He hid them.

48:37.148 --> 48:40.149
- From him.
She wasn't hiding them from us.

48:40.151 --> 48:42.084
They were in my closet.

48:43.821 --> 48:47.757
She wants us to know
that she's her own artist.

48:47.759 --> 48:48.891
Right?

48:48.893 --> 48:50.860
She doesn't want
to do his art anymore.

48:50.862 --> 48:53.963
Same as us. She is...
she is being forced into it,

48:53.965 --> 48:55.097
just as we are.

48:55.099 --> 48:58.701
We're all being forced
into this crap.

49:01.906 --> 49:04.640
And what if he isn't
doing that?

49:04.642 --> 49:06.943
What if this is real?

49:06.945 --> 49:08.444
I mean, just consider it.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.779
Baxter, come on.

49:09.781 --> 49:11.681
- It could be real, Annie.
Come on.

49:11.683 --> 49:13.749
That's what he wants.

49:13.751 --> 49:15.017
This is what he wants.

49:15.019 --> 49:16.819
He wants us to think
that they're dead.

49:16.821 --> 49:19.422
It's pretty low,
even by his standards,

49:19.424 --> 49:20.756
but that's what he wants.

49:20.758 --> 49:23.693
He wants child A,
child B crying, doing this.

49:23.695 --> 49:26.255
- Mm-hmm.
I hope you're right.

49:29.534 --> 49:32.335
My...
son of a bitch.

49:32.337 --> 49:33.536
What?

49:33.538 --> 49:37.440
That son of a bitch!

49:37.442 --> 49:38.975
If this is an art piece,

49:38.977 --> 49:40.843
then they're recording us.

49:40.845 --> 49:43.179
And they've got cameras
somewhere.

49:43.181 --> 49:45.348
And they're trying
to tape us.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.930
Caleb?

50:00.932 --> 50:02.698
Camille?

50:04.402 --> 50:06.369
I know it!

50:06.371 --> 50:08.637
Come on! Dad?

50:09.707 --> 50:12.267
I know they're hiding
somewhere.

50:13.578 --> 50:14.810
Just waiting.

50:14.812 --> 50:16.912
We are... we are going
to bed early.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.247
We're getting up early.

50:18.249 --> 50:19.782
We're putting
our heads together

50:19.784 --> 50:21.317
and we're going
to search for them.

50:21.319 --> 50:24.053
And we're not going
to stop until we find them.

50:47.745 --> 50:49.678
I can't think of anyone.

50:49.680 --> 50:52.681
They didn't have any friends.
We're their only relatives.

50:52.683 --> 50:55.785
Well, somebody's helping them.

50:57.188 --> 50:59.422
- What are you doing?
What is that?

50:59.424 --> 51:00.956
This is a corkboard.

51:00.958 --> 51:03.359
I can't conduct an investigation
without a corkboard.

51:03.361 --> 51:07.530
And I am pinning
all this stuff to it.

51:07.532 --> 51:09.465
Been through
their address books,

51:09.467 --> 51:10.966
through their e-mails.

51:10.968 --> 51:15.071
And I haven't really found
anything that jumps out.

51:21.079 --> 51:23.846
Don't you think we should let
the sheriff do all this?

51:23.848 --> 51:26.382
- No, no. The sheriff isn't
looking for them.

51:26.384 --> 51:29.118
The sheriff is looking
for murderers.

51:37.395 --> 51:41.363
Yeah, and if we do
find them and they're alive,

51:41.365 --> 51:42.631
what then?

51:42.633 --> 51:44.133
What do we do?
Do we punish them?

51:44.135 --> 51:46.602
This isn't about
punishment, Baxter.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.270
This is about honesty.

51:48.272 --> 51:52.775
This is about saying, "Enough.
We're done. Cut the crap.

51:52.777 --> 51:54.777
"No more pretending.
You're not dead.

51:54.779 --> 51:56.345
"We're not in mourning.

51:56.347 --> 51:59.148
We're not going
to play anymore."

52:00.384 --> 52:02.017
We're going to get on
with our lives.

52:02.019 --> 52:05.821
We're going to be a real family
for once.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.490
Live a real life.

52:08.593 --> 52:10.526
- And rent a Winnebago.
You know?

52:10.528 --> 52:13.596
Are you making fun of me?

52:13.598 --> 52:14.830
No.

52:14.832 --> 52:16.232
I'm doing this for us.

52:16.234 --> 52:17.533
For all of us.

52:17.535 --> 52:19.201
You understand that, right?

52:23.708 --> 52:25.374
Okay.

52:28.412 --> 52:30.513
Are you hungry?

52:30.515 --> 52:32.715
- No. I have to stay focused.

52:32.717 --> 52:34.850
Watch a few of these.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.919
Stay focused.

52:43.227 --> 52:45.194
I do not feel comfortable
doing this.

52:45.196 --> 52:47.029
- And it's just a bad idea.
- Have you heard,

52:47.031 --> 52:48.764
"The show must go on"?

52:48.766 --> 52:50.232
Well, that is what happens
when the leading man

52:50.234 --> 52:52.067
crashes his car into a tree
on opening night.

52:52.069 --> 52:53.502
- I have to stage manage.
- Baxter.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.905
Coby is in the hospital
with a broken collarbone.

52:55.907 --> 52:58.807
This is my final performance
of my senior year.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.142
There are kissing scenes.

53:00.144 --> 53:02.044
- I'm an actor.
I won't be kissing you.

53:02.046 --> 53:03.913
- Yes, you will.
- I'll be kissing Romeo.

53:03.915 --> 53:06.682
Played by your brother.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.251
I just heard about
what happened to Coby Reed.

53:09.253 --> 53:10.653
- We got a packed auditorium.
- It's okay.

53:10.655 --> 53:11.854
Baxter's going
to step in.

53:14.125 --> 53:16.959
Miss Delano, are you familiar
with the plot of this play?

53:16.961 --> 53:18.360
- Baxter knows the lines, Joe.
Without him,

53:18.362 --> 53:20.062
we don't have a play.
- Yeah, well,

53:20.064 --> 53:21.564
with him we have incest.

53:21.566 --> 53:22.765
All right, very well.

53:22.767 --> 53:23.999
We will do this play.

53:24.001 --> 53:25.534
There will be no kissing.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.002
It's "Romeo and Juliet."

53:27.004 --> 53:29.004
That's the deal,
Miss Fang.

53:31.108 --> 53:33.375
- You're going to be great.
Go get dressed.

53:36.781 --> 53:39.315
Though grant
for prayers' sake.

53:39.317 --> 53:42.885
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

53:42.887 --> 53:46.422
Thus from my lips, by thine,
my sin is purged.

53:53.564 --> 53:57.366
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

53:57.368 --> 53:59.468
Sin from thy lips?

53:59.470 --> 54:01.170
Give me my sin again.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.614
You kiss by the book.

54:13.117 --> 54:15.117
People are laughing
because of you.

54:15.119 --> 54:16.318
You are ruining...

54:16.320 --> 54:18.687
Good evening
to my ghostly confessor.

54:18.689 --> 54:20.856
Romeo will thank thee,
daughter,

54:20.858 --> 54:22.191
for us both.

54:42.346 --> 54:46.482
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

54:52.423 --> 54:53.889
Bravo!

54:55.493 --> 54:57.026
Bravo!

54:59.597 --> 55:01.530
- You know what?
- I really appreciate that.

55:01.532 --> 55:03.198
Best Shakespeare
I've ever seen.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.401
B, I'm telling you,
so good.

55:05.403 --> 55:07.703
- It was so good.
- Miss Delano.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.305
- Get in the car.
Come on.

55:11.475 --> 55:12.908
Quite a night, right?

55:12.910 --> 55:14.643
I was just fired,
actually.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.045
What?

55:16.047 --> 55:17.413
Oh, it was worth it.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.748
Tonight we did
what theater should do.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.984
But it wasn't your fault.

55:21.986 --> 55:23.686
Oh, I knew what I was
getting into.

55:23.688 --> 55:25.521
I told your parents when
we were preparing this thing

55:25.523 --> 55:28.957
that the best art
always leaves scorched earth

55:28.959 --> 55:30.626
in its wake.

55:30.628 --> 55:31.927
Scorched earth.

55:31.929 --> 55:34.129
What do you mean?

55:34.131 --> 55:36.465
When we were
preparing this thing?

55:36.467 --> 55:40.135
Your parents didn't tell you?

55:41.906 --> 55:43.605
It was their idea.

55:43.607 --> 55:46.008
But I was honored
to be a part of it.

55:46.010 --> 55:48.610
You might not believe it,
but I studied at my university.

55:48.612 --> 55:50.245
I studied in the experimental
theater wing.

55:50.247 --> 55:54.016
So your parents are just
two of the most important

55:54.018 --> 55:56.118
avant-garde artists
of our time.

55:56.120 --> 55:58.253
Of course,
I helped them.

55:58.255 --> 56:00.389
Well, what about Coby Reed?

56:00.391 --> 56:03.125
How'd you know he'd just
crash his car?

56:03.127 --> 56:05.160
Oh, your parents
took care of him.

56:05.162 --> 56:06.995
No, no, no, no.
Goodness, no.

56:06.997 --> 56:10.299
They paid him $500
to drop out of the play.

56:10.301 --> 56:12.735
The crash was just
bad luck.

56:12.737 --> 56:15.838
Why would they
do all that?

56:15.840 --> 56:18.440
For art, darling.

56:20.378 --> 56:21.710
For art.

56:36.527 --> 56:38.160
We're such cattle,
you know?

56:38.162 --> 56:41.063
People need to be shaken up,
snapped out of it,

56:41.065 --> 56:44.433
look around,
see things in a new way.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.301
That's what we try
to do in our work,

56:46.303 --> 56:49.037
because if you shake
something up hard enough,

56:49.039 --> 56:50.806
it gets transformed.

56:50.808 --> 56:52.441
It's not really about
what we do.

56:52.443 --> 56:54.476
It's what they do.
- Yeah.

56:54.478 --> 56:57.045
<i>- The people watching.
Our work has an effect on them,</i>

56:57.047 --> 56:58.514
<i>because we wake them up.</i>

56:58.516 --> 57:01.016
<i>We bring them back to life.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

57:01.018 --> 57:02.384
It's a resurrection.

57:02.386 --> 57:04.219
And not a reflection
of the human condition?

57:04.221 --> 57:05.888
- No. You know it's not.

57:05.890 --> 57:09.124
Who wants to see a reflection
of the human condition?

57:09.126 --> 57:11.293
I suppose that happens
when our pieces

57:11.295 --> 57:12.728
are shown in galleries.

57:12.730 --> 57:14.696
"Oh, look what they did.
Look how people responded.

57:14.698 --> 57:16.331
It's so human
and wonderful."

57:16.333 --> 57:17.633
But that's not the art.

57:17.635 --> 57:19.568
To me, by then,
you know, it's over.

57:19.570 --> 57:22.938
Yeah, we really only do
gallery shows to get grants.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.440
Mm-hmm.

57:24.442 --> 57:27.743
The art is in the actual moment,
as it's happening.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.378
<i>Real people really responding.</i>

57:29.380 --> 57:31.280
<i>The actual human condition,</i>

57:31.282 --> 57:33.182
<i>not some artist's
version of it.</i>

57:33.184 --> 57:35.083
<i>But isn't that just life?</i>

57:35.085 --> 57:37.019
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

57:37.021 --> 57:39.488
Not a reflection of life,
but life itself.

57:39.490 --> 57:43.058
Art and life, life and art.
We make them interchangeable.

57:43.060 --> 57:46.161
And both are enriched
because of it.

57:46.163 --> 57:48.797
Do you think other art
can do that?

57:48.799 --> 57:51.166
- No. What, painting?

57:51.168 --> 57:53.001
Photography?
That's the opposite.

57:53.003 --> 57:54.203
That's death.

57:54.205 --> 57:55.737
Art happens when things
move around,

57:55.739 --> 57:58.273
not when you freeze them
in a block of ice.

57:58.275 --> 57:59.842
That was art.

57:59.844 --> 58:02.744
You're crazy.

58:04.281 --> 58:07.516
This is not.

58:10.321 --> 58:12.087
See?

58:12.089 --> 58:13.522
- Cheers.
- Right?

58:13.524 --> 58:15.123
That's right.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.592
- Did I surprise you?
- You surprised me.

58:16.594 --> 58:19.495
You always do, don't you?

58:20.931 --> 58:23.232
Anyway, that's what I mean.

58:24.969 --> 58:26.702
- Hey, Baxter?
- Yeah?

58:28.038 --> 58:31.006
The "Romeo and Juliet" thing.

58:31.008 --> 58:34.243
That was when it all stopped
being simple, isn't it?

58:34.245 --> 58:36.311
Well, isn't that
when you left?

58:36.313 --> 58:40.682
- No. I left because I went
to college.

58:42.286 --> 58:44.219
Hey, why are you getting
dressed up?

58:44.221 --> 58:46.788
I want to look the part.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.791
What part?

58:49.793 --> 58:51.994
The part of someone
who gets up in front of a class

58:51.996 --> 58:53.662
and isn't completely
petrified by it.

58:53.664 --> 58:56.465
- You're going?
- Yeah. Is that wrong?

58:56.467 --> 58:59.134
I just think
it's a little strange.

58:59.136 --> 59:02.304
I mean, come on.
Making public appearances

59:02.306 --> 59:03.572
when your parents
are missing?

59:03.574 --> 59:05.774
Well, I need
the distraction.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.209
Oh, Baxter.

59:07.211 --> 59:10.812
Well, then I want to go.
I want to hear you speak.

59:10.814 --> 59:12.581
I'm not really going
to be speaking.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.049
I'm just going to be
answering their questions.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.018
- I don't care.
I want to go.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.486
All right.

59:17.488 --> 59:19.154
I don't want you
jumping in, though, okay?

59:19.156 --> 59:21.156
They just... they want
to hear from me.

59:23.861 --> 59:25.494
I won't say a word.

59:25.496 --> 59:26.995
- Good. What do you think?

59:26.997 --> 59:28.730
What do I think?

59:28.732 --> 59:31.700
I don't know.
Lose the ear thing.

59:31.702 --> 59:35.971
Well, it's there
for medical reasons, but...

59:35.973 --> 59:38.840
I think it looks
a bit...

59:38.842 --> 59:40.909
Like I've been hurt.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.244
Distracting.

59:42.246 --> 59:44.346
They won't listen to your...

59:44.348 --> 59:46.415
It's not working with this
or this, right?

59:46.417 --> 59:49.985
- Because this is pretty tight.
- Just lose the ear thing.

59:49.987 --> 59:52.454
So, this is Baxter Fang,

59:52.456 --> 59:54.823
author of "House of Swans,"

59:54.825 --> 59:59.661
which was nominated for the
coveted Golden Quill Award.

59:59.663 --> 01:00:02.497
His second novel,
"The Underground" was,

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:03.765
befitting a second novel,

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.835
a more complex
and divisive book.

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:08.136
That's fair.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.939
He's going to talk
to us today

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.140
about the creative process.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.675
Baxter, take it away.

01:00:16.547 --> 01:00:18.113
Okay.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.582
Do they want to do
just questions?

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:22.784
I can... let me present...

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:27.022
I'll present to you
the how I work.

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:29.424
I'll tell you how I write.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:32.294
I write by computer.
I do it all on computer.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.863
And...

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.333
and I...

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:39.868
I chew gum.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.837
I find that very helpful.

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.941
Maybe you could speak
in more general terms.

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:48.543
You know, like what drives you
to put pen to paper.

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.379
A little more general,
generally?

01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:52.047
- A little more general terms?
- Yeah.

01:00:52.049 --> 01:00:54.449
Good, good.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:57.019
Let's see.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:01:00.055
Sometimes I get horrible
thoughts in my head.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.957
You guys ever get horrible
thoughts in your head?

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:03.692
You know, I can't
get them out,

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:06.895
so it helps me
to write them down.

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:11.900
Uh, when I was a kid I thought
a lot about this one...

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:14.136
I mean, I thought about
what would happen

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:17.005
if my parents died.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.508
And, um...

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:22.544
and I couldn't
get it out of my head.

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:24.246
Can't. Couldn't.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.481
Can't. And...

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.650
and you don't want
to think about it.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:31.386
But if you do
get stuck with it,

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:32.888
I suggest you write it down.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.289
That's what I did.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.791
I've...

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.827
well, my sister and I
don't have relatives.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:42.698
So in my story, we get...
we get taken to an orphanage.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.567
And this orphanage
is run by this woman.

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:48.704
And she mistreats
all these kids.

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:50.305
She's very harsh to them.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:54.810
And my sister and I,
we... we put up with...

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:58.613
with all the...
the harsh treatment for months.

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:02.150
And then we figure out
a way to escape.

01:02:02.152 --> 01:02:03.819
One night,
under cover of darkness,

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:06.588
we go through this
incinerator chute.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:07.956
We get out the bottom
of the chute,

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:12.494
and we scoot off
across this field of beets.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:14.629
I had it as a field of beets.

01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.298
Anyway, so this is
a field of beets.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.633
And we're running across it
and running across.

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:20.669
We're looking over our shoulder,
and all is good.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:22.204
We make it,
we get to the other side,

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.605
and there's this
peaceful forest.

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:25.674
And we go into this forest.
And it's...

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:28.543
We think that all the hardship
is behind us.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:32.047
But then suddenly a sack
goes over our heads.

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:35.751
And we're taken away into
this underground, like, lair.

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.386
And there's all these other
kidnapped kids in there.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.990
And another chapter of misery
would kind of start from there.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:45.627
I don't have that part yet.
But... anyway.

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:49.397
Anybody ever have
terrible thoughts like that?

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:51.066
- I do.
- Do you.

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.634
All the time.

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:55.437
Just write them down.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:58.907
It's helpful for me,
at least.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:00.642
You know, if I can't get it
out of my head, I just...

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:02.210
I write them down.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:04.146
Even if they're super weird,
I can control them

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:06.648
and I can... I can...

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:11.052
I can just... you know,
I can control my world,

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:12.287
you know, with writing.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.855
That's what writing is
for me.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.157
Just...

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.415
<i>You have five new messages.</i>

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.417
<i>First new message.</i>

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.286
<i>Hi, this is
Anne Amotta from...</i>

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:47.122
<i>Second new message.</i>

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:49.191
<i>This is WMAC in Albany.</i>

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:50.959
<i>We were hoping to schedule
an interview in regards...</i>

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.228
<i>Third new message.</i>

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.630
<i>Hey, this is Eddie Sanchez...</i>

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:58.366
<i>Fourth new message.</i>

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.068
<i>Hey, this is Sheriff Hale.</i>

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:01.937
<i>I said I'd call when
the blood results came back.</i>

01:04:01.939 --> 01:04:04.573
<i>I'm afraid that the blood
at the scene</i>

01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:06.908
<i>does match your dad's
DNA profile.</i>

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:08.410
<i>So it is real,</i>

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.145
<i>which obviously
none of us wanted.</i>

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:13.315
<i>But it does mean that we have
a serious situation here.</i>

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:16.218
<i>So we'll need to dig a bit
deeper into the investigation,</i>

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.719
<i>as we discussed.</i>

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.621
<i>I'd appreciate a call back.
Thank you.</i>

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.494
That doesn't mean anything.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:31.099
Caleb's done crazier things
than draw his own blood.

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:32.767
You know that.

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.614
Good night.

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.374
<i>Baxter!</i>

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.376
I think I found something!

01:05:48.378 --> 01:05:49.744
You were wrong.

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:51.079
You were wrong when you said

01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:52.647
that they didn't have
any friends.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:54.716
You forgot about Hobart.

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.351
Who's that?

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:58.987
- Hobart Waxman.
Their mentor.

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:00.789
If they told anyone
about their disappearance,

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.991
they would have told Hobart.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.893
Can we talk
about this tomorrow?

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:06.528
Because I'm right
in the middle of this.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.630
- The middle of what?
- I'm writing my book. I just...

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.398
I've thought of something
really good, and I'm...

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.268
- Oh, wow.
That's exciting.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.636
I'm excited about it.

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:17.339
So, what are we going
to do about Hobart?

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:19.274
He's got to be dead,
or pretty close to it.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:21.242
Then we'd better
find him soon.

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:23.144
- Annie...
- Come on.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.980
- I'm... no, I don't want...
- No, no, no.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.315
Don't do this to me.
Don't make me do it by myself.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.885
You promised. You promised that
we'd help each other.

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:36.891
The first year
I was in Hobart's class,

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:39.961
we went to see a piece
by the artist Chris Burdon,

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.397
whose work Hobart
did not care for.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:45.867
- Chris Burdon's a hack.
A complete and utter fraud.

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.535
So we're at
Burdon's gallery,

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.839
and he tell us he's going
to be shot today.

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:53.641
Sure enough, an assistant
pulls out a gun and shoots him

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.777
in the arm.

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:57.312
I was shocked.
I thought it was thrilling.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.881
And I made the mistake
of saying so in class.

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:03.318
So Hobart turns on me
and he says...

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.719
It's horseshit!

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.589
Art should never happen
in a controlled environment.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.691
That's not art.
I don't know what it is.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.026
Taxidermy.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.827
I mean, who the hell cares

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.496
if you let somebody
come and shoot you

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.231
in a goddamn galley?

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:19.300
There's no danger.
There's no... no surprise.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:22.537
No, it needs to take place
in the world,

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:26.975
around people who just
don't know that it's art.

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:30.979
That's the way
it has to be.

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:34.082
He was so
disappointed in me.

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:35.817
I had to make it
up to him somehow.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.685
Caleb and I were dating,

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.955
and he asked me
if I could run a camera.

01:07:40.957 --> 01:07:43.391

I... I shot him

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:25.066
with a crossbow.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:26.667
He almost used a rifle.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.002
And thank God you didn't.

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.404
No, he knew it was

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:30.738
He just didn't know when.

Whoa!

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.595
- He's a good guy.
- Yeah, he's all right.

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:55.529
Hobart.
- Hobart.

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.966

there's anybody here.

01:09:14.584 --> 01:09:16.451
So, what now?

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.919
Even better.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:21.189
Let's find an open door,
search the house.

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:23.057
- Hang on.
What are you talking about?

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.094
- Come on, let's split up.
Quick!

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.629
- We're just going to break in?
- Yeah.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:29.310
- Annie...
- Come on.

01:10:20.817 --> 01:10:22.383
- Don't move, honey!
- Oh!

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:24.986
I'll put a hole
in your boyfriend.

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:26.421
He's got a gun.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:27.622
Take it easy, Hobart.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:29.190
You... you know us.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:34.462
Annie. Annie Fang.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:36.364
Holy shit.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.267
Is this Baxter?

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:42.170
- Yeah. Baxter.
Baxter Fang.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:45.173
I'll be damned!

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:47.408
So can you take the gun
out of my back now, please?

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.677
Oh, hell,
I don't have a gun.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.579
Just my finger.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:52.814
- Oh.
- Bang, bang.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:56.451
You got me.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:11:00.855
Annie, I haven't seen you
since you were a little thing.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:03.391
I watched all your movies,
though.

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:06.594
And you too, Baxter.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.696
Those books are terrific.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.531
Thank you.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:11.933
Well, not that second one.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.468
That was...
- Not for you?

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.970
But the first one,
that was very good.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.805
- Thank you.
Yeah, the second one...

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:21.309
The second one was...
that was a challenge.

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.412
Third one's going
to be good, though.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:27.582
So I read about
your parents.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.617
Awful story.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.319
Think they're really dead?

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:34.756
- I think it's very possible.
- No, no, no. I don't.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.925
I think you're helping them.

01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.928
Is that why you're here?

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:43.831
You're the only one
who believes in them enough

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.934
to not tell anyone else, so...

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:49.504
They love you.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:52.440
They most certainly do not.

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:55.310
We had a falling out
years ago.

01:11:55.312 --> 01:11:57.278
- Really?
- Is that right?

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.680
Mm-hmm.

01:11:58.682 --> 01:12:00.648
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.054
Well, what was it about?

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.691
It's not my place to say.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:16.931
Can I offer you
a little advice?

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.533
Sure.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.435
Stop looking for them.

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:27.742
It was a bad idea,
tangling up family and art.

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:29.644
It...

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:33.481
But maybe you're free
of that now.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:38.953
You need to stop
thinking of this as a slight

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.556
and start thinking of it
as a gift.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.393
Yeah.

01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:46.561
A gift.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.479
I know I shouldn't.

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:06.347
What is this?

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:10.918
They were lost
after you left.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.488
The work suffered terribly.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:14.589
So a few years back,

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:17.225
I offered to finance
a documentary on them,

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:20.228
to celebrate
what you'd all done.

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.497
But also to close
that chapter

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:25.066
so they could move on
to something new.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:28.035
A documentary.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:31.639
- Yeah. It was a...
it was a terrible idea.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:34.442
We never released it,
obviously.

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:38.212
But you asked about
the falling out.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:46.020
Tell me, did you ever think
that what you were doing

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:48.122
might have an adverse affect
on the children?

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:51.325
- No. Children are
amazingly resilient.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:55.062
When my cousin Jeffrey was 2,
he got stuck in a well

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.664
for three days.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.101
And now he's got a family
and he sells vinyl siding.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:02.036
So there you go.

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.338
And when did you decide

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.607
that you wanted to use them
in the work?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.109
"A" was a baby.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:11.279
And, to be honest,
after she was born I was...

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.514
Well, I was miserable.

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:16.083
I thought, "This is the end
of our life."

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:18.419
- As artists.
- Obviously as artists,

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:20.855
because... and I've heard this
over again,

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:22.857
children kill art.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.692
They just do.
You have them,

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:28.162
and the passion you had
for creative expression

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:29.430
becomes secondary.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:31.132
Some people believe that.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:33.167
I went into
a terrible funk,

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:35.670
but then the most wonderful
thing happened.

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:38.873
Near Christmas, we took the baby
to see Santa at the mall.

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:40.641
- It was my idea.
I thought it'd be cute.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.643
<i>- We grabbed the camera.
We go down there.</i>

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:46.681
<i>And I put A
on this rancid hobo's lap.</i>

01:14:46.683 --> 01:14:50.551
<i>And she, of course, screams,
but in a way I'd never heard.</i>

01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:52.787
<i>It was like something conjured
by the dark arts,</i>

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:55.923
<i>like a horde of demons were
going to fly out of her mouth.</i>

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:58.292
<i>And poor Santa's
trying to shake her loose.</i>

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:01.529
The elves go running
for the break room.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:05.066
Families grab their children,
run from the line.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.701
It was pandemonium,

01:15:06.703 --> 01:15:09.237
<i>and an epiphany for me.</i>

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:14.308
<i>I thought, children don't have
to kill art.</i>

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:18.346
<i>Not if they are the art.</i>

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:22.984
<i>For the first time
I thought,</i>

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:26.787
<i>"Hey...</i>

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:27.989
I think I want kids."

01:15:27.991 --> 01:15:29.457
Jesus.

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:30.992
Don't say that.
- It's true.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:34.328
Um, you know,
I don't want that in there.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:35.696
- Why?
- I want that whole

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.431
last section cut.
- Why? That was great.

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:39.367
- What he said about the kids.
- That was great stuff.

01:15:39.369 --> 01:15:40.735
No, Hobart, no.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:44.605
- What? But...
- No, if you put that in there,

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:47.141
I swear I'm not coming back.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:49.377
- Come on, where are you going?
- I'm done with this.

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.445
No, not unless
you promise me.

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:52.914
If we're going
to tell the story

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.516
don't we have to tell
the real story?

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:08.496
<i>- Baxter.
- Hmm?</i>

01:16:08.498 --> 01:16:10.331
<i>I know how to find them.</i>

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.334
- Annie, it's late.
Go to bed.

01:16:13.336 --> 01:16:15.136
- No, no, no, no.
Mom's paintings.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:17.371
We do this gallery show.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.674
We call it "The Hidden Art
of Camille Fang,"

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.576
and we promote it
like a memorial,

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.511
and then Caleb
will come out of hiding.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:26.314
He will be incensed.
He will rail against it.

01:16:26.316 --> 01:16:28.416
What do you think of that?
What do you think?

01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:31.152
- Please, come on.
I think you're drunk. Come on.

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.820
- I'm not drunk.
- I can smell it.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:35.723
- No, I've had a drink.
I'm not drunk.

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:39.360
Turn off that goddamn light
right now and go to bed, Annie.

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:41.562
Stop watching that
fucking documentary.

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:43.064
I have a friend
who has a gallery.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:45.132
- You sound like an idiot.
I'm finished with this.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:46.801
I'm all done.

01:16:46.803 --> 01:16:49.770
I'm done helping you
with this search.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:53.007
I'm done with the road trips
and the corkboard.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:55.876
I'm doing all this
because I'm your brother, Annie,

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:59.347
and I love you, and I think that
you might need all this stuff

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:01.582
to help you get through
all this stuff with Mom and Dad.

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:03.951
But I'm starting to think
that you're just avoiding it.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:05.419
- Avoiding what?
- I think you're just

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:07.488
avoiding the truth.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.259
Come on.

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:29.410
And if they're not dead,

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:32.279
they want everyone
to think that they are,

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:34.015
including their own kids.

01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:38.252
So if we find them,
what difference does it make?

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.188
You can't say
anything to them

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.491
to make them change
who they are.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:47.261
You don't know that.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:49.397
- Yes, I do.
And for some reason,

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:50.965
you've got some crazy idea
in your head

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:53.467
that suddenly they're going
to stop being who they are.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:56.270
And they're going to stop
doing the things that they do,

01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:59.073
and being the people
that they are, Annie.

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:03.411
That they're going to suddenly
become these normal parents,

01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:08.282
and it's going to help you fix
all of your... stuff.

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.484
It's just not
going to happen.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:12.053
We can't fix them.

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:15.356
We can only
fix ourselves.

01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:22.630
Can we, though?

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:24.565
Yeah.

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.636
I think we can.

01:18:28.638 --> 01:18:32.473
And moving on
is the start.

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:36.744
You think they're dead,
don't you?

01:18:39.549 --> 01:18:42.109
You thought it
the whole time.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:46.754
I don't know.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.661
If they're dead,
it's horrible.

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:56.464
But if they're not dead...

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:02.436
it's kind of worse.

01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:06.073
In a lot of different ways.

01:19:07.677 --> 01:19:09.210
So either way,

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:11.378
I just think they're gone,
you know?

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.290
Hi.

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:05.826
Find anything
you like yet?

01:21:05.828 --> 01:21:07.895
I got my eye
on a couple of things.

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:09.196
Yeah?

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:12.099
What's this music?

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:13.734
Oh, this is...
I don't know.

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:15.202
Something from my parents'
collection.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.638
If you like it,
I can get you a deal.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.773
What about...
what about this?

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:21.709
What about this instead?

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:23.677
That you can have.

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.512
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:26.714
Annie won't mind?

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:28.249
No, it's mine.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:29.783
I won that.

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:31.785
- Even better. Even better.
- I'm giving it to you.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:33.621
- How do I look?
- You look good.

01:21:33.623 --> 01:21:35.623
Try it on. I bet it fits you.

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.958
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.227
- Through here.
- Hang on a second.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.129
- Hang on a second.

"The Vengeful Virgins"?

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:12.559
What...

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:15.229
Song four.

01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.164
"K.A.P. Kill All Parents."

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:19.633
- Is everything okay?
- Let me see that.

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:23.837
"Kill All Parents"
is a Fang song.

01:22:23.839 --> 01:22:26.473
Annie and I sang this
in a piece as kids.

01:22:26.475 --> 01:22:27.775
Annie wrote this song.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:29.476
Didn't see sing this
at Central Park?

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:31.178
And Dad's camera was destroyed.
There's no footage.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.713
- Yeah.
- The only way they'd know

01:22:32.715 --> 01:22:34.315
about this song is through you,
me, Mom or Dad.

01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:36.617
"The Vengeful Virgins
recently signed to Light Noise,

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:39.386
"a tiny indie label
based in the northwest.

01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:41.388
"Lucas and Linus Baltz of 14,

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:43.424
"self-taught musicians
obsessed with the apocalypse

and still living
in Massachusetts."

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.689
Why am I so afraid
they're going to kill us?

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.191
They're not going
to kill us.

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:19.526
We're just looking
for information.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:21.829
- Yeah, okay. You ready?

01:23:29.372 --> 01:23:31.739
Okay, you're looking
for an address book,

01:23:31.741 --> 01:23:33.440
lyric sheet, diary,
anything that's helpful.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.843
Yeah. Got it.

01:23:35.845 --> 01:23:37.411
Remember your lines?

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:38.946
I do. I got it.

01:23:38.948 --> 01:23:42.182
- Want to run it?
- No, I don't want to run it.

01:23:43.252 --> 01:23:44.651
- Hi. Is that Linus?

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:47.554
- Lucas.
- Mmm, Lucas.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:50.090
Fifty-fifty shot.

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:52.226
We're the writers
from "Spin."

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.727
"Spin" magazine.

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:56.997
Were you not expecting us?

01:23:56.999 --> 01:23:57.998
No.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.167
- Oh, that's weird.
- No?

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.069
I'm Janet Day.

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:04.138
This is Pete Sanders.
- I'm Pete.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.975
And we're here to do the
profile on you and your brother

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:09.309
for the magazine.
- Yeah.

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:10.844
We're supposed
to do an interview.

01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:13.080
Usually interviews
go through our manager.

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:14.415
- Yeah, we did that.
- Sure.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.250
- Oh, this is...
- Yeah, did nobody call you?

01:24:16.252 --> 01:24:17.951
Strange they didn't
give you a heads up.

01:24:17.953 --> 01:24:19.453
I mean, anyway,
can we come in?

01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:21.555
Because this isn't going
to get it done, so...

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.991
Hey, there's Linus.

01:24:23.993 --> 01:24:26.994
- Who are they?
- "Spin" magazine.

01:24:26.996 --> 01:24:29.229
They want to do a story
about us.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:30.597
How's it going?

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:32.032
Yeah, you might
even get the cover.

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:34.201
- That's true. That's true.
- So...

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:35.636
Mind if we jump in?

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:37.104
Is that all right?

01:24:37.106 --> 01:24:39.940
Just... just start talking,
you know?

01:24:39.942 --> 01:24:42.209
What kind of guitar
do you play?

01:24:42.211 --> 01:24:44.645
Hey, do you guys mind
if I use your restroom?

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.480
It's down the hall.

01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:48.282
- Is that down this way?
- Yeah.

01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:50.017
Thank you.

01:24:50.019 --> 01:24:51.819
Um, I got it from
a catalogue.

01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:53.020
Some cheap thing.

01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:55.589
We don't care about instruments.

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:57.257
Great. Uh...

01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.961
What are your influences?

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:05.065
Um, we like speed metal,
I guess.

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:06.967
But we're not good enough
to play it.

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:10.170
We listen to some rap.

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:12.172
Cool.

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.675
Great.

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:16.810
And...

01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:22.449
Tell me about the song "K.A.P."

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:26.753
Um, what do you
want to know?

01:26:27.383 --> 01:26:29.449
What made you write it?

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:35.722
We just thought people
should kill their parents

01:26:35.724 --> 01:26:38.192
if they want to do
anything good with their lives.

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:40.928
It's a stupid song, really.

01:26:40.930 --> 01:26:44.064
You didn't write
the song, Lucas.

01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:46.033
- Yes, we did.
We wrote it.

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:48.202
No, you didn't.

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:49.937
And I'm going to write
an entire article about it

01:26:49.939 --> 01:26:52.506
unless you tell me
who did.

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:59.246
<i>- Yeah. Pan down.</i>

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:02.316
<i>- Pan down on my...
- Oh, oh, my God!</i>

01:27:02.318 --> 01:27:04.017
<i>- Oh, God, that hurts.
- Are you all right?</i>

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:05.419
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Good, good.</i>

01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:06.386
<i>Aah!</i>

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:08.021
<i>That's good, that's good.</i>

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:09.423
<i>That's good, that's enough.</i>

01:27:09.425 --> 01:27:11.158
<i>Okay...</i>

01:27:13.162 --> 01:27:15.028
<i>Put it... put it on
the steering wheel.</i>

01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:16.830
<i>All right.</i>

01:27:16.832 --> 01:27:18.832
You didn't write it.

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:20.567
Who taught it to you?

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:22.469
Come on.

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:23.971
Who?

01:27:23.973 --> 01:27:25.906
I think you should go.

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:29.910
Where'd you get that song?

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:31.111
Hey, Annie...

01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:32.312
Where'd you get the song?

01:27:32.314 --> 01:27:33.780
Okay, we didn't
write it.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.482
But it was the first song
we played,

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:37.351
so we put it on the album
because we knew it so well.

01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:39.086
- Of course you didn't write it.
You want to know why?

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:41.388
I wrote the song.
- What is this?

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:44.191
They said they were
from "Spin," Mom,

01:27:44.193 --> 01:27:46.159
but I don't think they are.

01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:52.966
Go play out back, boys.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:55.469
Miss Delano?

01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:56.703
What the fuck?

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:59.072
I said go out back.

01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:10.884
Where are our parents?

01:28:12.688 --> 01:28:15.222
Leave us alone, please.

01:28:15.224 --> 01:28:17.858
Just let us
live our lives.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.494
Tell us what you know
about them.

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:23.897
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:28:31.707 --> 01:28:33.674
A and B.

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:40.480
I'd like to say I'm surprised,
but I'm not.

01:28:41.583 --> 01:28:44.284
I should have known
you'd find me.

01:28:50.526 --> 01:28:52.359
Where's Mom?

01:28:52.361 --> 01:28:55.662
Uh, she doesn't live here.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.666
Do you?

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.640
You pay attention, Caleb.

01:29:06.642 --> 01:29:09.509
You've obviously been working on
this for a very long time.

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:10.977
And Baxter and I,

01:29:10.979 --> 01:29:13.380
we want to ruin it for you
very badly.

01:29:13.382 --> 01:29:15.482
We want it to explode
in your face.

01:29:15.484 --> 01:29:17.117
And that is what's going
to happen

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:20.087
unless you tell me exactly
what I want to know.

01:29:20.089 --> 01:29:21.388
Didn't I warn you?

01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:23.590
Shut up!

01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:25.792
What the hell is this?

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:27.327
That's our family.

01:29:27.329 --> 01:29:30.831
- How long ago was this taken?
Look at this.

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:32.165
Seven years ago.

01:29:32.167 --> 01:29:33.700
Bonnie's my wife.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.102
Really?

01:29:35.104 --> 01:29:37.404
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:40.841
Those boys love Caleb,
so don't you ruin that.

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:42.476
Stop.

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.044
He's been a wonderful father
to them.

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:45.545
He goes to baseball games
and concerts.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.948
And you don't need him.
We do.

01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:52.119
You can think what you want,
but he dotes on the three of us.

01:29:52.121 --> 01:29:54.121
Stop talking!

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:00.861
You take us to Camille.

01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:03.063
Yeah, let's go see Camille.

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:05.198
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.760
You take us to Camille
right now.

01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:12.639
<i>- Okay, now give me a rag.
- All right, all right.</i>

01:30:12.641 --> 01:30:14.107
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- I can't believe

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:15.642
you slashed your arm
like this.

01:30:15.644 --> 01:30:18.111
- Ridiculous.
- We needed the blood.

01:30:21.316 --> 01:30:23.016
What's Mom's fake name?

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:25.185
Patty Howard.

01:30:25.187 --> 01:30:27.454
Does she have
a fake family too?

01:30:27.456 --> 01:30:28.622
No.

01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:31.558
See, Bonnie inherited
this cabin up north.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.927
Mom's been spending
summers there,

01:30:33.929 --> 01:30:35.629
getting to know people
in town

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:39.299
so it wouldn't be suspicious
when she settled there.

01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:42.102
So this has been
in the works for a while.

01:30:42.104 --> 01:30:44.104
For several years, yes.

01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:46.273
We had to be thorough.

01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:49.109
Create new identities
we could slip into

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.111
when Caleb and Camille died.

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:53.447
We needed
social security numbers,

01:30:53.449 --> 01:30:55.649
bank accounts,
tax history.

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:58.218
Otherwise, it wouldn't
have worked.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.454
It didn't work.

01:31:27.683 --> 01:31:29.616
- Hello, Annie. Baxter.

01:31:29.618 --> 01:31:31.351
Hello, Patty.

01:31:31.353 --> 01:31:32.953
Here's how this
is going to go.

01:31:32.955 --> 01:31:35.555
You're going to answer
a couple of questions,

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:39.192
and then you're going
to do what I tell you next.

01:31:39.194 --> 01:31:41.228
Let's start at why?

01:31:41.230 --> 01:31:44.164
- The work. Why else?

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:46.500
This was meant to be
our defining work.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:50.036
An event so large
it would overshadow

01:31:50.038 --> 01:31:52.339
everything we'd done before.

01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:56.009
But then it became clear
that you no longer saw value

01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:57.744
in our work.

01:31:57.746 --> 01:32:00.180
We knew we couldn't
trust you with the plan.

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:02.249
We kept it from you.

01:32:02.251 --> 01:32:04.518
So you suckered in
Miss Delano instead

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.819
to help you?

01:32:05.821 --> 01:32:07.521
We didn't sucker in anyone.

01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:09.356
She came on willingly
long ago.

01:32:09.358 --> 01:32:11.725
Some people appreciate
our work.

01:32:11.727 --> 01:32:15.729
He and Bonnie were to live
as husband and wife

01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:17.230
in appearance only.

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:20.367
And that worked
for a couple of years.

01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:25.005
But things happened.

01:32:25.007 --> 01:32:27.307
You're adults.
You know that.

01:32:27.309 --> 01:32:28.808
Hold on a second.

01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:31.444
You're actually the father
of those boys?

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:35.081
Every piece has its own
complications.

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.416
And for what it's worth,

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:38.285
the boys did help
with the cover story.

01:32:38.287 --> 01:32:41.288
- Wow. You actually replaced us.

01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:43.290
No one replaced anyone.

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:45.292
You didn't want
to work with us.

01:32:46.595 --> 01:32:48.895
Why did you put up
with all this?

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:50.597
The art.

01:32:50.599 --> 01:32:52.933
Everything we've ever done
is for the art.

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:54.701
No, it wasn't just the art,
Caleb.

01:32:54.703 --> 01:32:55.835
You know that.

01:32:55.837 --> 01:33:00.407
Everything I do
is out of love for you.

01:33:00.409 --> 01:33:04.144
And I made him a promise
after you were born.

01:33:04.146 --> 01:33:07.714
He wanted to leave,
and I swore to him.

01:33:07.716 --> 01:33:12.686
that if he figured out a way
to be happy and still stay,

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:16.156
then I'd always
do the same for him.

01:33:16.158 --> 01:33:19.259
Even sacrifice
your own children?

01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:20.827
- Don't say that.
- Come on.

01:33:20.829 --> 01:33:22.862
When push came to shove
every time,

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:25.165
you chose him over us.

01:33:25.167 --> 01:33:27.534
For God's sake,
you talk like I'm a monster.

01:33:27.536 --> 01:33:29.402
We had a good life.
You were happy children.

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:31.471
You forget how fun
those pieces could be.

01:33:31.473 --> 01:33:33.807
The thrill of leaping in...
- Oh, give me a break.

01:33:33.809 --> 01:33:36.910
No net, not knowing
what was going to happen.

01:33:36.912 --> 01:33:38.445
You're telling me
that wasn't fun?

01:33:38.447 --> 01:33:40.280
The adventures we had.

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:42.649
What did other kids do?
Go to the Grand Canyon.

01:33:42.651 --> 01:33:45.452
Disney World?
We did something important.

01:33:45.454 --> 01:33:47.187
I think I would have
preferred Disney World, okay?

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:49.923
- If you're asking.
- Yeah, and a mom and a dad.

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:53.360
I've always
loved you kids.

01:33:53.362 --> 01:33:56.696
Whatever ambivalence
I might have felt early on,

01:33:56.698 --> 01:33:57.864
it turned into love.

01:33:57.866 --> 01:33:59.566
As long as we didn't
do shitty movies

01:33:59.568 --> 01:34:02.602
and compromise your artistic
sensibilities, huh?

01:34:02.604 --> 01:34:04.270
What, I'm not allowed
to disapprove your choices?

01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:06.806
That's like the main thing
parents do.

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.109
What's your take
on the Vengeful Virgins?

01:34:09.111 --> 01:34:11.544
That stupid CD,
that damn song,

01:34:11.546 --> 01:34:13.613
it nearly ruined everything.

01:34:13.615 --> 01:34:16.349
Promise your dad
that you won't tell.

01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:19.019
- No, we're pulling the plug.
This little piece is over.

01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:20.987
- The hell it is.
- The hell it isn't.

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:22.255
I'm going to take this,

01:34:22.257 --> 01:34:23.456
I'm going to go
right to the press.

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:24.691
- You give that to me.
- No.

01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:26.092
You're going to ruin
years of work

01:34:26.094 --> 01:34:27.727
because your feelings
got hurt.

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:29.362
- That's right, Pop.
- Come on, just be reasonable,

01:34:29.364 --> 01:34:31.564
both of you,
and just don't blow this up.

01:34:31.566 --> 01:34:33.967
- Well, that's what we Fangs do.
We blow things up.

01:34:33.969 --> 01:34:35.168
Look, we get it.

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:36.936
You think we damaged you.

01:34:36.938 --> 01:34:40.373
Fine. My parents damaged me.
Her parents damaged her.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.442
You have kids.
You're going to damage them.

01:34:42.444 --> 01:34:44.110
That's what parents do.

01:34:44.112 --> 01:34:45.912
So what?

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.488
I'm not a young man anymore.

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:58.692
This is the last big thing
I'll ever make.

01:35:02.431 --> 01:35:03.763
Come visit once a year,

01:35:03.765 --> 01:35:06.566
and just please
don't tell.

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:13.973
You want us to pretend
you're dead?

01:35:19.981 --> 01:35:21.381
Sure.

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:23.383
We can do that.

01:35:28.323 --> 01:35:30.857
Come on.
Give it to me.

01:35:30.859 --> 01:35:32.158
We can do it.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.560
Yeah?

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:42.035
Well, thank God that's over.

01:35:42.037 --> 01:35:43.837
Okay.

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:50.310
Let's go.

01:35:50.312 --> 01:35:52.512
You may not understand
or appreciate

01:35:52.514 --> 01:35:55.849
or value what we do,
but you cannot deny

01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:59.185
its relevance, its...
its effectiveness.

01:36:00.555 --> 01:36:04.324
Everything we did
woke you up.

01:36:04.326 --> 01:36:06.126
Made you look
at your life anew.

01:36:06.128 --> 01:36:07.727
That's what we do
for people.

01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:09.529
That's what we've always done.

01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:11.765
And that's a good thing.

01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:13.533
- Yeah. Yeah, I suppose it is.

01:36:13.535 --> 01:36:15.301
But you know what happens
to those people?

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:17.003
What?

01:36:17.005 --> 01:36:19.572
Well, they walk away.

01:36:19.574 --> 01:36:21.708
You never see them again.

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:28.348
Keep going to those
baseball games.

01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:30.750
The boys will like that.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:36.623
You ready?

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.493
I'm ready.

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:49.435
<i>Now...</i>

01:36:49.437 --> 01:36:52.605
<i>imagine you're dead.</i>

01:36:52.607 --> 01:36:56.109
<i>Feel yourself go numb.</i>

01:36:58.413 --> 01:36:59.879
<i>Start with your fingers.</i>

01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:02.749
<i>Move to your hands,
your wrists,</i>

01:37:02.751 --> 01:37:05.518
<i>right on up
to your elbows.</i>

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:10.557
<i>Everything is dead.</i>

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:16.162
<i>If we can imagine
our own deaths</i>

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:19.799
<i>but still manage
to come back to life,</i>

01:37:19.801 --> 01:37:24.871
<i>then it proves that we can
survive anything.</i>

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:28.241
<i>"'Don't be afraid.</i>

01:37:28.243 --> 01:37:30.276
<i>"'Own the moment.</i>

01:37:30.278 --> 01:37:31.711
<i>"'If you're in control,</i>

01:37:31.713 --> 01:37:33.313
<i>"'then the chaos

01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:35.815
<i>"'and not to you.</i>

01:37:35.817 --> 01:37:37.784
"Do you understand?'

"The children nodded,

01:37:40.121 --> 01:37:41.688
"and the pit master
threw open the door

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:43.790
"that led to the arena.

01:38:17.726 --> 01:38:19.792
<i>"But still, the siblings
