WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.802
Sorry, mate. I'm sorry, mate.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.931
Excuse me, mate.
What are you...

00:07.007 --> 00:08.031
What are you doing?
English?

00:08.108 --> 00:09.872
If you're taking the mickey, you
picked on the wrong person.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.639
Let me tell you that. No, I'm
not picking on you at all.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.271
You're English, correct?
Yeah, big time, yeah.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.781
I'm working on
an English character.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.841
Would you mind... It's
called Reginald Poofter.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.181
Oh.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.484
David Brent, my liege.
How are you?

00:21.555 --> 00:23.217
Michael Scott.
Oh, bloody hell.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.055
I do characters as well.
I got a Chinese fella.

00:26.126 --> 00:28.152
Not politically correct,
but he's called Holy...

00:28.228 --> 00:29.992
That's what it
sounds like.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.958
"Herro! Herro!"
I do Ping.

00:32.064 --> 00:33.863
"Herro. I'm Ping." You
can't do that these days.

00:33.934 --> 00:34.958
You can't.
I'm Ping! No.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.561
No, no. And people
don't understand

00:37.638 --> 00:41.837
that it has nothing to do with making
fun of a different nationality.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.572
No, no, no.
No, comedy is a place

00:44.645 --> 00:47.547
where the mind goes
to tickle itself.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.344
That's what she
said.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.952
That's good.
Pleasure to meet you.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.422
Where are you working?
Dunder Mifflin.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.456
Any jobs going?
No, not right now.

00:58.525 --> 00:59.652
Just let me know.
All right.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.752
See you around.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.291
Bye, bye.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.724
What a nice guy.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.957
Your first student is
here, Mr. Bernard.

01:32.025 --> 01:36.053
That's actually "Master
of Ceremonies" Bernard.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.597
Last year,
I went to a seminar

01:37.664 --> 01:39.064
called "The 10 Secrets
of Real Estate."

01:39.132 --> 01:42.500
Turns out it was just a ploy to
sell me timeshares in Idaho.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.767
Cut to, you know, I'm
spending a weekend in Boise,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.637
terrible time,
super lonely.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.006
But I get to thinking,

01:49.076 --> 01:53.411
maybe I should put on my own
seminar to lure clients.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.637
Oh.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.248
Hello, I am here for the
small business seminar.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.693
Michael?
Nein, I'm Greek!

02:05.759 --> 02:07.193
My name is Mykonos.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.353
Ooh.

02:08.428 --> 02:09.622
Oh.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.523
Wait, Michael?

02:11.865 --> 02:12.889
Michael?
Okay.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.026
I am the plant.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.730
Every great seminar has one.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.294
My job is to make
the speaker look good,

02:18.372 --> 02:22.173
and I do this through the
techniques of leading questions

02:22.242 --> 02:25.007
and laughing at all jokes.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.105
And the character, Mykonos,
is just a little added flavor.

02:28.181 --> 02:32.846
Mykonos is loosely based on
another character I do, Spiros,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.484
who is more about the ladies.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.625
Thank you so much,
Tuna Turner.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.159
You are simply
the best.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.123
Listen, this isn't a
favor, all right?

02:41.194 --> 02:42.594
This is a good idea.
We all win.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.653
Go higher.
All right.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.790
I get super flexible
when I'm nervous.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.890
Wow.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.801
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.898
Hey, Andy, I'm really, really
sorry to do this to you,

02:53.974 --> 02:55.602
but I have
a meeting today

02:55.809 --> 02:57.471
that I totally forgot,

02:57.544 --> 02:58.978
so I can't be a part
of this seminar.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.173
No! What?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.945
You can't do that. You are a
critical part of this seminar.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.507
You're the charming warm-up guy.
I know.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.951
If the seminar was a meal,
you'd be the amuse-bouche.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.683
You signal the flavors of the whole night.
I'm really sorry. I can't do it.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.746
You can't. You can't.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.588
I can't have
this go badly.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.683
I'm a terrible salesman,

03:13.827 --> 03:16.490
and I haven't been making very
many sales lately, or ever.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.532
This is my only idea on how
to turn things around.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.430
If it goes badly,
I might lose my job,

03:20.500 --> 03:23.299
which would suck, because this is the
only job I've ever been good at.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.672
Will you let me know when this
whole seminar thing's over?

03:26.873 --> 03:28.774
What's going on?
Do you know that guy?

03:29.242 --> 03:30.904
I just have a meeting,
outside the office.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.411
Hey.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.340
How are the marks?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.145
What are some of your
small business ideas?

03:37.217 --> 03:40.619
I was thinking we could buy up a
bunch of abandoned mineshafts.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.054
That's great.
There's a big,

03:44.124 --> 03:45.490
big future in that. A lot
of mines in Scranton.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.822
Um,
what about you?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.657
Uh, credit cards.
Uh-huh.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.891
My company will act
as an inter-medium

03:50.964 --> 03:52.865
for, like, 0.2 cents
off every transaction.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.923
Wow!

03:54.000 --> 03:54.990
Or something
with cell phones,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.561
like, every time you make a
phone call, I'd make 0.2 cents.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.173
Or anything. Like, any online
shopping, I get 0.2 cents basically.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.471
Right. Okay?
Yeah.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.533
Okay.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.074
You promised us whales.
These are worms.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.707
They're not worms,
Dwight, okay?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.048
They're just people
with tiny businesses.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.611
They're baby whales, which
is even cuter. I'm out.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.414
Stanley, you're
supposed to close.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.480
I'm out, too.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.819
What?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.326
I already lost Jim.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.995
Salesmen are supposed
to help each other out.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.189
We're supposed to be a team.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.287
We're no more a team

04:24.364 --> 04:27.732
than the people staying in
the same hotel are a team.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.427
You know what
might be kind of fun?

04:29.503 --> 04:32.598
I was thinking, you know,
Andy's having a seminar today?

04:32.672 --> 04:34.664
What if we went in
as a Greek couple?

04:34.741 --> 04:37.006
Mykonos and... Oh, I
don't know, Michael.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.739
I'm not feeling up to that.
Okay.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.804
Holly broke
up with A. J. last week,

04:40.881 --> 04:45.114
which is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.882
To Holly, it's been the
worst week of her life,

04:47.954 --> 04:52.085
and I know for a fact that there
was a week for her in High School

04:52.159 --> 04:56.028
when she got mono
and her first period ever.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.725
Too much information?
That's what I thought.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.361
But you know what?
Here I am using it.

05:02.435 --> 05:07.499
If you change your mind, why
don't you talk to Mykonos?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.343
Is Mykonos Greek?
He sounds Italian.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.741
Ugh. You're the fifth person
to tell me that today.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.647
Maybe Mykonos ran away
to join the Italian circus.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.775
Okay, yeah, like
a character history.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.911
Good. Tom Hanks does that.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.150
Yeah.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.023
Is "JLP" a word?

05:27.093 --> 05:30.530
"Jelp?" J-E-L-P?
No, J-L-P.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.858
Like, "I Jlp...
I Jlp you!"

05:33.700 --> 05:35.191
I don't think
that's a word.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.032
I'm playing
scrabble with Gabe,

05:37.103 --> 05:39.129
and I've never
won a game.

05:39.206 --> 05:43.007
The winner gets to pick the movie we watch.
I have won no games.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.513
So far I've seen
The Shining,

05:46.580 --> 05:49.778
Rosemary's Baby,
The Ring.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.381
Not really my thing.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.851
Although, I... I do like the
early parts of the movies

05:55.922 --> 05:58.756
where they have a perfect
family and everything.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.084
You want some help?

06:00.961 --> 06:01.951
Really?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.018
Mmm-hmm.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.455
Yes.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.927
K-A. "Ka?"
What does "ka" mean?

06:09.035 --> 06:12.733
It means you're playing someone
who's going to destroy you.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.800
Why did you play "moo?"

06:14.908 --> 06:16.376
Because I'm
playing to win.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.811
I'm playing "moo," I'm playing
"milk," whatever it takes.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.679
Okay, but look, you
could have hit "mood."

06:23.383 --> 06:25.375
Would have played a...
A triple word. Ah.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.081
Like the cow
mood yesterday.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.178
God.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.417
Or moon.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.659
The cow jumped
over the moon.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.989
She's stuck on
that one thing.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.790
You know it doesn't have to
just be cow stuff, right?

06:36.129 --> 06:40.624
Kevin, Jim dropped out of
my seminar, and I'm just...

06:40.700 --> 06:43.192
I was wondering if you could replace
him as my charming warm-up guy.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.001
Andy, I'm no Jim. I'm...

06:46.072 --> 06:49.042
The only way that I'm Jim
is in the movie version

06:49.109 --> 06:53.547
when Jim sees what his future would
be like if he never met Pam.

06:53.647 --> 06:57.584
Hey, that's crazy talk.
I think you're great.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.644
Then I won't let you down.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.120
Pink.
Indigo.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.350
Hi, Ryan, you went to
business school, right?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.448
Yeah.
I need somebody

07:05.525 --> 07:06.925
to talk to this
seminar about business.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.723
And? Can you do it?

07:08.795 --> 07:09.785
Okay.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.265
I don't... I don't like committing
to things just like that.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.323
So, no?

07:14.401 --> 07:17.599
No, I don't like committing
to not doing things, either.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.038
That's just as big a commitment.
Oh, baby.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.098
What do I put you
down for, bro hombre?

07:22.509 --> 07:23.533
Yes.

07:23.743 --> 07:24.767
All right!
Yes, I'll do it.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.109
Okay, thank you so much.
It's gonna be awesome.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.876
And if I flake, I flake. What?

07:29.749 --> 07:31.411
Kevin, you open it up. Yep.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.919
Ryan, you come in with your
small biz expertise, right?

07:33.987 --> 07:37.389
And then Creed, guest
speaker extraordinaire.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.490
And then I come in and just
close all the sales and stuff.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.554
Okay, here we go.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.293
One, two, three!

07:46.366 --> 07:47.800
Team!
Creed!

07:52.572 --> 07:54.564
Welcome everybody.
Awesome to see you guys.

07:54.741 --> 07:57.768
My name's Andy Bernard, but you
can call me "The Nard Dog."

07:57.944 --> 07:59.845
Hi, Nard Dog.
I'm Lu Peachem.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.347
Let's get things
started, shall we?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.974
You guys ready to hear from the
Dunder Mifflin business experts?

08:05.585 --> 08:07.178
Good. Well, as you can
see on your program,

08:07.253 --> 08:10.121
first up is a speech called,
"Don't just dream it, do it."

08:10.190 --> 08:14.355
Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr.
Kevin Malone.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.412
Four, five.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.420
Yes!

08:52.432 --> 08:54.526
There are some people
who have charm

08:54.601 --> 08:56.968
and some people
who don't.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.903
Guess which type I am.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.472
Charm type.

09:02.475 --> 09:06.606
Dream big. Right?

09:06.679 --> 09:10.241
So, what I
want you to do

09:10.316 --> 09:13.878
is dream the biggest
that you can.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.288
And then double it!

09:32.105 --> 09:34.700
Are you okay?
No. Yes!

09:34.774 --> 09:36.265
Here.
Mmm-hmm.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.038
I'm fine.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.945
Okay, from here now.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.946
The first lesson that
I'm gonna teach you,

09:44.150 --> 09:47.518
right, is about
finding success.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.217
And the key to finding success
is to picture a winner.

10:03.136 --> 10:07.267
Okay, so then, what are
you picturing right now,

10:07.340 --> 10:08.831
right this second?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.936
'Cause the universe
is yours, people.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.038
Get out of the way.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.217
I'm really excited to introduce
you guys to Ryan Howard.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.589
He has achieved a
great deal in the last...

10:27.660 --> 10:29.492
But perhaps no
achievement is greater

10:29.562 --> 10:32.088
than his on-again,
off-again girlfriend.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.360
What are you...

10:33.733 --> 10:34.792
Who am I?

10:34.868 --> 10:37.895
I'm Kelly Kapoor,
the business bitch.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.599
It is important
to brand yourself,

10:39.672 --> 10:41.436
so I have a couple
of things in the works.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.568
The business bitch,
the diet bitch,

10:43.643 --> 10:45.839
the shopping bitch,
the etiquette bitch.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.414
I could sit here, and I could tell
you the 10 secrets of business,

10:49.482 --> 10:50.780
and you would
have a great time,

10:50.850 --> 10:52.580
and you would
learn a lot.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.711
But who better
to tell you

10:54.187 --> 10:58.352
than the Yale University adjunct
professor in management,

10:58.424 --> 11:02.293
Professor Scott Powell,
who I have on my BlackBerry.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.129
It's ringing.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.964
Hey, Kelly Kapoor.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.027
What a delicious surprise.

11:11.104 --> 11:14.700
Professor Powell,
you are on speakerphone.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.338
Uh, why?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.902
Do you think you could tell us
the 10 secrets of business?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.815
Um, there aren't
really 10 secrets.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.851
Come on, Scott,
please. It's me.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.481
Uh, all right. Well,

11:28.054 --> 11:31.718
Uh, I guess know your
market would be key.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.886
Practice fiscal discipline.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.357
That brilliant little bitch.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.258
A little treat for
our old friend, Gabe.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.235
Put that "Q"
right there.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.894
Wait. Why?

11:44.971 --> 11:46.064
Put the "Q"
there, sweetie.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.135
I think there's better...
Put the "Q" there!

11:53.479 --> 11:55.107
Sorry I yelled.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.672
You could have just told
us what you were thinking.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.877
There's no theater
in that.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.114
There's no yelling in that, either.
Well...

12:01.287 --> 12:02.721
What do you do
in your free time?

12:02.789 --> 12:04.451
Practice Olympics.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.386
Do you like movies?

12:06.459 --> 12:09.987
I like the
musical Grease,

12:10.196 --> 12:12.165
or as we call
it, "home."

12:15.101 --> 12:16.501
We have to try this
out on somebody.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.531
Hello.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.831
Look, you want
to order something?

12:20.907 --> 12:23.900
She will have
a greekaccino.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.108
I don't know
what that is.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.673
It...

12:27.747 --> 12:32.151
It's a very strong coffee
with milk from a goat.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.816
I can't
believe it.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.186
It's a miracle.
She can talk.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.182
No more brain damage.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.092
No more brain damage!

12:44.631 --> 12:46.099
I don't know.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.529
Ladies and gentlemen, our special
guest speaker will provoke you.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.505
He will inspire you.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.773
He is...

12:56.843 --> 12:58.072
Creed Bratton.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.515
Two eyes, two ears,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.518
a chin, a mouth,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.755
ten fingers,
two nipples,

13:09.822 --> 13:11.950
a butt, two kneecaps,
a penis.

13:12.925 --> 13:16.259
I have just described to
you the Loch Ness monster.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.866
And the reward
for its capture?

13:19.932 --> 13:22.697
All the riches
in Scotland.

13:22.769 --> 13:26.103
So I have one question,
why are you here?

13:29.242 --> 13:32.770
Okay! All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

13:32.845 --> 13:36.338
it is now time for
the rarest of things,

13:36.416 --> 13:37.509
an actual free lunch.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.575
There's sandwiches in the back.
Certainly help yourselves.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.018
We'll meet back
up in an hour.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.420
I picked out our movie.
It's called Suspiria.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.821
It pushes all
the boundaries.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.986
All your preconceived notions about
what horror can be, come crashing down.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.529
When I win,

13:50.129 --> 13:51.495
we're gonna
watch Wall-E,

13:51.698 --> 13:55.191
where all the boundaries
of color are pushed.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.363
It is hard to explain why
Erin is doing so well today.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.067
The only thing I can
think is Erin is living out

14:01.140 --> 14:04.110
some Slumdog Millionaire
scenario,

14:04.177 --> 14:08.308
where every word she's playing has
a connection to her orphan past.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.113
It's possible.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.288
So what's your crazy
business pipe dream?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.584
Well, I started my own
golf supply company.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.528
Really? It's taken off
faster than I expected,

14:23.596 --> 14:26.395
so I came here to learn about
creating manageable growth.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.032
Phyllis?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.939
Some of these
people are for real.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.877
Hey, friend.
How's it going?

14:37.977 --> 14:39.775
Oh, you know what? Let
me steep that for you.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.982
Thank you. Hey, you know what?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.984
Good news.
We're back in.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.283
Let's go sell some
paper, buddy. Huh?

14:48.354 --> 14:49.515
Really?

14:51.657 --> 14:53.956
Excuse me.
I got it. I got it.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.121
Hey, do you
need a lozenge?

14:57.430 --> 14:58.625
They're a bunch
of jackals.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.722
What?

14:59.799 --> 15:01.927
They left you
in the lurch,

15:02.001 --> 15:05.597
and if they want to jump in,
it means you're almost there.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.764
You did this.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.100
Bring it home.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.885
Let me tell you what you can
do with your offer to help.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.012
You can table it and offer
it up another time.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.023
Just know that I really
appreciate the gesture.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.790
Hi. Hope you
enjoyed your lunch.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.328
Welcome back.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.727
Ooh, well, hello.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.334
Welcome to the seminar.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.960
Hey, man.
What's going on?

15:37.036 --> 15:38.060
You're gonna blow it.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.397
Maybe.
Only maybe.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.268
We got it.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.472
Wow, we got it.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.750
Oscar, wait. I think the victory
would be more meaningful

15:52.819 --> 15:55.288
if Erin puts the
last word in herself.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.554
Yes, Pam.
Yes, most definitely.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.752
Yes.
Yes.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.227
No.

16:04.897 --> 16:09.460
Although I must say, I will
have apoplexy if you lose.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.464
Do you understand? Apoplexy
is what I will have.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.965
Apoplexy.
Yes.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.771
Got it.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.115
Oh, Oscar.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.410
Oscar?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.143
I played "ape."

16:29.722 --> 16:32.988
I just want to make a point to
that last caller. I disagree.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.618
I don't think it is the
running game at all.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.493
I think we do have to make a
few moves in this off-season.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.690
Wow!

16:38.764 --> 16:40.858
What a day, right?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.868
Guess you guys are
probably ready to go.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.099
And you got my
business card, so...

16:45.171 --> 16:48.437
You know,
I like you.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.376
I'm going to give you
my secret gyro recipe.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.539
Come out here, since it's a
secret, and I'll tell you.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.279
All right, you have
to close right now.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.751
Yeah, I'm getting to it.

16:59.819 --> 17:00.946
No, you're not.
You're getting past it.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.352
You have to close.
Do it. You can do it.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.445
Yeah, yeah.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.820
Andy, what's
the problem?

17:05.290 --> 17:06.987
This is hard
for me. I'm a nice guy.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.553
You know, Kelly
and Creed, Kevin,

17:09.762 --> 17:11.195
they believe in you.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.021
Don't let them down.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.867
Don't let yourself
down, Andy.

17:15.935 --> 17:19.394
I'm gonna go back in. I'm going
to stall them for a little bit.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.805
I want you to get your head
together, and then come back in.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.240
I want you to close.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.407
What is taking that
guy so long?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.142
Psst!

17:35.354 --> 17:37.050
You think this thing's
gonna go much longer?

17:37.823 --> 17:38.950
I don't know.
They're still in there.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.051
Goodbye.
Stop.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.385
Out with it.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.030
Here's the story.

17:45.097 --> 17:49.193
That guy in there is Jim's
childhood friend, Tom.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.600
Tom Witashkin.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.161
One of my best
buddies, actually.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.230
And when they were both
in the third grade,

17:54.307 --> 17:56.242
Jim was placed in the
top reading group.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.369
I was blue group,
so I was second from the top.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.845
And Tom...
Was in green group.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.541
And Jim's
mom suggested

18:02.615 --> 18:06.643
that Jim spend time hanging with
the kids in his reading group,

18:06.719 --> 18:08.779
because she thought that they
would be a good influence.

18:08.854 --> 18:11.323
And that's what I told him.
Right.

18:12.124 --> 18:13.922
But how'd
you say it?

18:16.028 --> 18:18.088
"My mom thinks you're too
dumb to hang out with."

18:19.732 --> 18:21.257
Okay, who would
like to purchase

18:21.334 --> 18:24.327
this small business
package from me right now?

18:26.138 --> 18:27.731
Yes, we got one.

18:28.174 --> 18:30.837
Okay, the snowball is rolling.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.173
Who else?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.106
You can put it off
for a couple of days,

18:36.182 --> 18:38.344
but I guarantee you,

18:38.417 --> 18:42.081
eventually you're gonna
realize you need this.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.853
So the only thing that's
gonna be different

18:45.925 --> 18:48.019
is you'll be a couple
of days behind

18:48.094 --> 18:51.622
where you would be if you
bought this from me right now.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.425
So who's gonna
buy one right now?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.695
I'll take one.
Yes! Awesome!

18:58.771 --> 19:00.672
All right, anyone else?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.907
Sold! Anybody else?

19:05.978 --> 19:07.606
Yes! All right!

19:08.014 --> 19:09.744
- Yeah, bitch.
- Good choice.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.111
The rest of you
are dead to me.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.050
You made the stupidest
decisions of your life.

19:14.120 --> 19:15.748
No, no, no.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.153
But it was a pleasure
meeting you,

19:17.223 --> 19:20.125
and you've got my information,
so feel free to call anytime.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.222
Hey, you think it's coo I
if I grab a soda? Yeah.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.927
Yep, absolutely,
go ahead.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.159
Hey.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.230
Hey.
Hey.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.001
How's it going?
Pretty good. Good.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.566
It's been a while.
It has been, yeah.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.244
So you work here, huh?

19:39.311 --> 19:40.335
Sales.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.382
Must be a front for some
kind of famous laboratory.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.151
'Cause you're so smart.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.914
Oh, man. You remember
that, huh?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.115
Barely. I'm so dumb,

19:51.390 --> 19:52.858
you know, stuff goes
in, stuff goes out.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.724
Not like you probably remember
every paper sale you ever made.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.696
Paper salesman genius.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.757
All right, good catch-up.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.302
Yeah.
See you.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.235
Where's your jetpack,
Zuckerberg?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.633
Andy.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.134
I didn't think
you had it in you.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.907
Well, I guess when
you looked in me,

20:13.979 --> 20:17.472
you forgot about my balls.
They're on the outside.

20:18.684 --> 20:19.947
Don't know how
you missed 'em.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.549
Wonderful seminar!

20:22.621 --> 20:23.782
Almost as good

20:24.056 --> 20:26.651
as the day when
we first met.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.525
You are the
love of my life.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.325
Come to me, Necropolis.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.891
Put your lips on
my lips. Come on.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.732
Michael, I should
get back to work.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.104
What? Come on.
It's time for grapes.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.712
That was a fun day.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.379
So, I won.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.476
I know.
You get to pick.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.953
Well, that's actually what I
came to talk to you about.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.819
I know how much you
want to watch Wall-E.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.951
Yes? So I got us a compromise.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.585
This movie is
called Hardware,

21:02.695 --> 21:06.223
it tells the story of a killer
combat robot, just like Wall-E,

21:06.298 --> 21:08.824
that the government
invented to destroy humans.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.338
It's some of what you like and
some of what I like. And...

21:12.404 --> 21:16.307
Erin, I heard you talking
about movies before and...

21:16.375 --> 21:17.809
Anyway, I just watched
this over the weekend.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.311
I thought you'd
really like it.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.676
There's a Shrek 2?

21:20.746 --> 21:22.009
Oh, yeah.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.140
See you tomorrow.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.343
Nice guy.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.444
Ooh.
