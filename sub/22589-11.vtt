00:11.179 --> 00:15.642
<i>NARRATOR". In Gotham City,
when the social set goes diamond shopping...</i>

00:15.808 --> 00:19.145
<i>...there is only one place to go.</i>

00:19.312 --> 00:21.314
<i>And that place is Harry Hummert's.</i>

00:21.481 --> 00:27.779
<i>A veritable treasure house among the jewelers
catering to the Gotham City elite.</i>

00:27.946 --> 00:31.074
Oh, what an exquisite clock, Harry.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.328
I didn't see this when I was here last week.

00:35.495 --> 00:38.790
Oh, actually Mrs. Frontenac,
I only acquired it yesterday.

00:38.957 --> 00:40.917
It's a shop piece, not for sale.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.669
- Oh.
-You wanted to see something...

00:42.835 --> 00:45.255
...in a set of diamond clips, didn't you?
-Oh, yes.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.924
Yes, I'd love that.

00:51.761 --> 00:54.514
Perhaps one of these would please you,
Mrs. Frontenac.

00:54.681 --> 00:55.932
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:01.980 --> 01:03.481
Hummert would be astonished...

01:03.648 --> 01:07.485
...if he knew that the lens
of a transistorized TV camera unit...

01:07.652 --> 01:10.113
...is hidden in that antique clock.
-Oh.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.704
Control calling Second Hand.

01:17.870 --> 01:21.291
<i>Number 3 to</i> Control. Reading you.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.793
The time is at hand.

01:24.002 --> 01:26.838
Get ready to strike in 10 seconds.

01:27.046 --> 01:29.215
<i>We're wound up and ready, Control.</i>

01:29.382 --> 01:31.217
Stand by, Second Hand.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.396 --> 01:45.356
That's odd.

01:46.691 --> 01:48.318
Shouldn't be striking the hour now.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.528
There must be something wrong
with the mechanism.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.363
Such adorable cherubs.

02:12.842 --> 02:16.638
Hummert's? Robbed? Broad daylight?

02:16.846 --> 02:19.515
Commissioner, did you hear the news?

02:19.724 --> 02:22.101
Yes, Chief O'Hara.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.687
And ominous news, I'd say.

02:24.854 --> 02:28.524
The knockout gas the criminals used
came from an antique clock.

02:28.691 --> 02:34.906
Then it's himself, that conniving crook
who uses time for crime, the Clock King.

02:35.073 --> 02:39.202
I fear we're in over our heads, Chief O'Hara.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.704
I'll contact the Caped Crusaders at once.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.881
One moment, commissioner.

02:52.048 --> 02:54.967
I shall expedite his presence.

02:58.054 --> 03:01.974
I don't pay enough attention
to the two of you.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.396
Oh, you do. You do.

03:06.604 --> 03:10.149
Just run along and enjoy yourself,
Aunt Harriet. We'll be fine.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.612
Ha, ha. Hmm.

03:14.821 --> 03:16.447
- Check.
-Oh!

03:16.614 --> 03:18.825
- The Batphone, sir.
-Hmm?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.369
- The Batphone.
-Oh.

03:21.536 --> 03:23.996
That was perfect timing.

03:26.165 --> 03:29.210
I quite agree. From what you say
about the robbery at Hummert's...

03:29.419 --> 03:32.964
...it clearly indicates the modus operandi
of Clock King.

03:33.131 --> 03:34.590
Clock King?

03:34.757 --> 03:38.886
Apparently, Dick. But this time,
we'll bypass police headquarters.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.054
What?

03:40.221 --> 03:44.642
When one is dealing with a villain
like Clock King, one must use time wisely.

03:44.851 --> 03:48.730
We'll go directly to Hummert's gem shop
and try to pick up the lead from there.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.815
To the Batpoles.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.897
Excellent.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.191
Every move right on schedule.

05:16.526 --> 05:19.111
Just look at all these goodies.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.030
You're marvelous, Clock King.

05:21.197 --> 05:25.535
That, my dear,
is because I plan every move like a timetable.

05:25.743 --> 05:29.580
As my archenemies,
Batman and Robin, will soon find out...

05:29.747 --> 05:31.249
...to their detriment.

05:31.415 --> 05:37.338
Thinking. Every minute, every second.
Thinking.

05:37.547 --> 05:38.965
Men.

05:39.841 --> 05:42.718
You've done well. I'm proud of you.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.263
Thanks, Your Highness.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.642
Ah. I see it is almost the hour.

05:55.189 --> 05:59.569
Zero minus seven, six, five...

05:59.777 --> 06:00.945
Here it comes again.

06:01.153 --> 06:06.075
Three, two, one, zero.

06:21.716 --> 06:23.676
Lovely. Lovely.

06:23.843 --> 06:28.014
What an exquisite,
exciting rhapsody of sound.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.601
Millie, back to your dusting.

06:31.809 --> 06:33.895
Second Hands...

06:35.605 --> 06:37.315
...we have work to do.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.150
That's all I know about it, Batman.

06:39.317 --> 06:42.820
I bought the clock at the Parkhurst Galleries.
I go there nearly every week.

06:42.987 --> 06:46.657
Every Wednesday, as a matter of fact.
Benson Parkhurst is an old friend of mine.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.785
Obviously, Clock King learned
that it was Mr. Hummert's habit...

06:49.952 --> 06:52.496
...to go to that particular auction gallery.

06:52.663 --> 06:57.001
And he had the clock put up for sale
knowing he'd be sure to bid on it.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.794
Thank you, Mr. Hummert.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.840
Come, Robin.
Let's pay a visit to the Parkhurst Gallery.

07:03.883 --> 07:05.134
Men.

07:05.301 --> 07:06.969
And Millie.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.388
According to my crime table...

07:09.555 --> 07:13.517
...our next target will be
the Parkhurst Art Gallery.

07:13.684 --> 07:14.727
Gee.

07:14.894 --> 07:19.231
After which, we will strike at the home of one
of Gotham City's wealthiest young socialites.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.193
No kidding, Your Highness.
A triple hit in a day?

07:22.401 --> 07:25.738
Another of my clever little clocks
was bought by a dear old lady...

07:25.905 --> 07:27.949
...who lives in the home of a millionaire.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.535
Then, after that pair of jobs...

07:31.744 --> 07:34.038
...I have a real coup in store.

07:35.957 --> 07:41.337
In fact, it may well be the biggest clock crime
of my distinguished career.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.131
Biggest, Clock King?

07:46.842 --> 07:50.930
Your Highness, please don't hate me
for mentioning them...

07:51.097 --> 07:54.433
...but what about Batman and Robin?

07:54.642 --> 07:56.394
Batman and Robin.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.481
The nights I've lain awake, scheming,
plotting my revenge...

08:00.648 --> 08:04.068
...against those flat-foot prints
in the sands of time.

08:04.276 --> 08:08.572
Those shadows
on the sundial of true criminal genius.

08:08.739 --> 08:14.412
However, if Batman and the Boy Blunder,
ha, ha...

08:14.704 --> 08:16.122
"Blunder."

08:16.330 --> 08:18.874
If they should attempt to cross my plans...

08:19.083 --> 08:22.878
...they'll find they're just in time
to count their final seconds.

08:23.045 --> 08:27.258
And when they do, I'll strike hard.

08:29.427 --> 08:32.929
I'd be glad to help you in anyway, Batman.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.057
Things are little hectic here today.

08:35.224 --> 08:38.894
We're getting ready upstairs
for our first Pop Art show.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.565
We'll try not to detain you, Mr. Parkhurst.
Do you recall the man...

08:42.732 --> 08:46.152
...who brought the clock here to be auctioned?
The one Mr. Hummert bought.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.948
I'll have to consult the auction book
for that day.

08:51.157 --> 08:53.659
Now, let me see.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.412
Oh, yes. Here it is.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.872
Now I remember him.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.250
He was a heavyset man with a small beard...

09:01.459 --> 09:05.046
...and, urn, his name was Mr. Chronos.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.422
Chronos?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.924
- The Greek word for "time."
-Correct, Robin.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.302
Thanks to your diligence
in foreign languages...

09:11.469 --> 09:14.388
...we can now safely assume
that the mysterious Mr. Chronos...

09:14.555 --> 09:17.224
...is actually Clock King in disguise.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.226
Amazing.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.812
The way you two figured that out.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.689
I could have never done it.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.900
Don't feel bad, Mr. Parkhurst.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.403
You haven't been trained in deduction
as we have.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.323
Come, Robin, we must be going.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.577
We must find something
that will give us a clue...

09:36.744 --> 09:39.955
...as to where our evil enemy,
Clock King, will strike next.

09:40.164 --> 09:44.043
I think I have an idea
where we might find that lead.

09:44.251 --> 09:48.255
- Where, Batman?
-Dunbar's Drive-In.

09:52.927 --> 09:54.637
Good afternoon, Gotham City viewers.

09:54.804 --> 09:57.181
This is your roving TV reporter,
Fred Forbes...

09:57.348 --> 10:00.893
...welcoming you to the What's New in Art?
segment of our Gotham City report.

10:01.060 --> 10:04.313
Coming to you today
from the famous Parkhurst Galleries.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.153
For years, the Parkhurst Galleries
have been known...

10:11.320 --> 10:14.949
...for their exhibitions and auctions
of art that have stood the test of time.

10:15.116 --> 10:20.246
But now, Mr. Benson Parkhurst, the owner
of the galleries, has bowed to the inevitable...

10:20.496 --> 10:23.415
...and the galleries are having
their first exhibit...

10:23.624 --> 10:26.043
...of Pop Art.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.504
And it seems to be a hit.

10:28.671 --> 10:32.049
- Out of the way. Make way, please.
-Something that's not on the program.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.803
- This way. Careful. Gently, gently.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.638
What is going on here?

10:37.847 --> 10:39.682
What's going on here, my dear sir...

10:39.890 --> 10:43.561
...is certainly not an exhibition
of true Pop Art.

10:43.853 --> 10:47.314
This way. Out. Forward.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.652
Ah.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.698
Inferior.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.284
All definitely inferior.

10:58.492 --> 11:02.329
- And just who are you, sir?
-Heh.

11:03.164 --> 11:06.750
I am Progress Pigment, the king of Pop Art...

11:06.959 --> 11:09.795
...and apostle of its culture.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.339
A little more to the left, boys.

11:15.467 --> 11:20.139
Now, I will let you have the honor
of viewing my latest masterpiece.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.974
Off.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.398
<i>I call it Time Out Of Joint.</i>

11:29.565 --> 11:31.275
- What--?
-What is this?

11:36.071 --> 11:38.365
This is certainly an incredible machine.

11:38.532 --> 11:42.536
- It is really a work of art.
-Get this junk out of here.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.956
Junk? Do you realize what this is?

11:46.165 --> 11:49.043
You are looking
at the symbolization of time.

11:49.210 --> 11:52.838
Time, the ever-moving balance wheel
of the universe.

11:53.047 --> 11:54.423
Observe.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.388
Everything will be all right. Please, don't go.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.735
Yeah, wait. It'll be all right.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.117
Hey, it's the Batmobile.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.703
- Just look.
-I am looking.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.165
And isn't Robin too much?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.550
At the risk of sounding naive, Batman...

12:38.717 --> 12:41.804
...how do you expect to find a lead
to Clock King in this drive-in?

12:41.971 --> 12:44.473
At one point, in his sordid criminal career...

12:44.640 --> 12:47.935
...he had a feminine accomplice
named Thelma Timepiece.

12:48.102 --> 12:49.395
Oh, of course.

12:49.603 --> 12:53.232
Welcome to Dunbar's, Batman and Robin.
What will it be today?

12:53.399 --> 12:57.403
We're looking for someone who might
be working here. Thelma Timepiece.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.530
Oh, yes. Thelma.

12:59.697 --> 13:02.741
Sorry, Batman. You can't win them all.
She quit last week.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.703
I think she went back to her hometown
in the Midwest.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.913
But I'd be glad to take your order.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.248
I am a little hungry.

13:09.415 --> 13:12.418
Of course, Robin.
Even crime-fighters must eat.

13:12.584 --> 13:16.588
And especially you. You're a growing boy
and you need your nutrition.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.465
Hamburgers. Medium rare.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.176
May I recommend, Batburgers?

13:21.635 --> 13:22.845
Batburgers?

13:24.555 --> 13:28.434
-"Trouble stealing your appetite?"
-"Arrest it with our new Batburger."

13:28.642 --> 13:30.644
I'm honored by this tribute, miss.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.689
Two Batburgers, medium rare...

13:33.856 --> 13:36.900
...and two glasses of orangeade.

13:37.318 --> 13:39.028
Uh, doubles.

13:42.114 --> 13:45.993
Turn on the Bat-scope, Robin. Let's see
what's on the Gotham City TV news report.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.374
<i>FORBES". There it is, folks. An uninvited entry
here at the Parkhurst Galleries.</i>

13:52.791 --> 13:56.837
<i>As you can see, the artist Progress Pigment
has his contraption working.</i>

13:57.046 --> 13:59.590
<i>And the only word to describe it is "wild."</i>

13:59.798 --> 14:02.760
<i>He even has</i> a <i>name for it:</i> Time <i>Out Of Joint.</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:05.220
<i>Time Out Of Joint?</i>

14:05.429 --> 14:09.475
- Time? Do you suppose--?
-If only we could only get a closer look at him.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.436
<i>FORBES". We're going to bring
Progress Pigment in for a closer look.</i>

14:12.644 --> 14:16.231
<i>I want all you folks to see
a most unusual artist.</i>

14:16.440 --> 14:18.609
<i>Progress Pigment?</i>

14:24.615 --> 14:28.494
The beret, the beard, dark glasses.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.082
There is a way we could make sure.
The Bat-photoscope.

14:33.248 --> 14:37.002
Sure. It'll activate the microfilm crime file
in the Batcave...

14:37.169 --> 14:40.422
...and transmit a normal photograph
of the Clock King to us here.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.775
Yes.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.318
Ah.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.494
How does it look, Robin?

15:11.703 --> 15:14.623
Holy masquerade. It's Clock King.

15:14.832 --> 15:18.419
- Miss? Would you take our baskets, please?
-Oh, sure.

15:23.132 --> 15:26.468
Men, the hour is at hand.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.149
- It worked.
-Naturally.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.777
Few people can stand the vibrations
of supersonic sound.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.738
Now let's get what we came after.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.249
That fool, Parkhurst.

15:57.458 --> 16:01.628
The sound of this mechanical sculpture
covered up the buzz of the saber saw...

16:01.837 --> 16:04.131
...as it was cutting through his stronghold.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.467
And right in front of his eyes.

16:17.561 --> 16:18.854
Ah.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.524
Here it is.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.819
My favorite clock masterpiece.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.031
And now it's mine, all mine.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.034
Come, my good Second Hands.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.119
Careful with it. Careful.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.121
Careful.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.539
Ah.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.837
Right on schedule.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.298
We've completed another foolproof crime.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.217
Let's go.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.807
You can only fool some of the people
some of the time, Clock King.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.685
Batman and Robin. At them, men.

16:58.894 --> 17:02.064
I'll give a personal bonus
to the first man who knocks out Batman.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.857
Four against two.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.486
I would say that the odds are in our favor,
Robin.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.200
Come on. Fight, fight. Go.

17:53.574 --> 17:56.493
Wait.
This valuable painting might be damaged.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.829
Isn't it beautiful?

18:00.622 --> 18:03.083
Please, let me put it down
so it won't be hurt.

18:03.292 --> 18:04.876
Agreed?

18:05.043 --> 18:06.712
Agreed.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.884
I seem to have hurt my wrist a little bit.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.429
Just give me a moment.

18:17.389 --> 18:20.976
Anytime you're ready, Clock King.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.854
Just give me a minute. A minute...

18:24.021 --> 18:26.231
...to touch my counterattack activator.

18:33.405 --> 18:36.241
Holy mainspring. I can't move.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.410
Perhaps I should've titled my creation:

18:38.619 --> 18:41.413
<i>The Dynamic Duo:
Caught in the Coils of Time.</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:43.498
The cops.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.878
That'll be Chief O'Hara. I contacted him
with the mobile Batphone on the way here.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.356
I'll have you free in a jiffy, Robin.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.399
Batman.

19:11.234 --> 19:14.529
Dynamic Duo, are you all right?

19:14.738 --> 19:17.991
Yes, Chief O'Hara.
Only our pride has been hurt.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.618
Clock King and his cohorts escaped.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.716
Robin. Look.

19:34.925 --> 19:37.636
Clock King dropped one of his watches.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.973
He must have accidentally dropped it
when he massaged his hurt wrist.

19:42.265 --> 19:45.018
And it's not the seal type, either.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.354
Quickly, Robin, to the Batcave.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.691
I want to examine this watch carefully.

19:58.699 --> 20:03.662
According to the Bat-chemical Analyzer...

20:03.870 --> 20:07.582
...the dust in Clock King's watch...

20:07.791 --> 20:10.293
...contains aluminum oxide.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.295
- Is that important?
-indeed it is, Robin.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.841
Aluminum oxide is used
in the manufacture of synthetic gems.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.719
I still don't get it.
How does that connect to Clock King?

20:18.885 --> 20:19.928
It's obvious, Robin.

20:20.095 --> 20:24.266
Synthetic gems are widely used
in jeweled watch movements.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.810
- Holy sundials. Then you mean--
-Exactly, Robin.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.311
Clock King's hideout is--

20:28.520 --> 20:31.982
ls a place where they make
synthetic jewels for watches.

20:32.190 --> 20:35.318
We'll just feed the necessary data
into the Batcomputer.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.785
Well, this has to be it, Robin.

20:43.994 --> 20:48.582
"Tick Tock Synthetic Rubies incorporated."

20:48.790 --> 20:53.712
According to this card, that firm
went out of business four months ago.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.727
A wise idea to make a surprise entrance
through the rear of the building.

21:08.935 --> 21:13.148
Wiser yet, old chum,
if we make it up the outside of the building.

21:16.193 --> 21:20.238
This should be good practice if something
ever takes us to Mount Everest, Batman.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.658
I think we'll be confining our campaign
against evil to Gotham City...

21:23.867 --> 21:25.827
...for some time to come, old churn.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.163
It needs us.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.499
Hey, Batman and Robin.

21:30.707 --> 21:33.585
- What are you guys doing?
-Just routine crime-fighting.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.712
Would you like to come in?
I'm rehearsing.

21:35.921 --> 21:40.425
Thank you, citizen, but our pursuit of justice
allows us few diversions.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.094
- Be seeing you.
-Bye, Robin.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.143
Hey, you guys come and catch
my act sometime. I dig yours.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.103
All right, fellas, one more time.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.980
<i>From a whip-or-will</i>

22:14.292 --> 22:16.837
Ha, ha. Welcome.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.880
I've anticipated your visit.

22:19.089 --> 22:23.552
That's why I coated that section of the floor
with super slick watch oil.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.637
Second Hands.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.164
Batman...

22:53.331 --> 22:56.167
...we're inside a giant hourglass.

22:58.461 --> 23:00.922
You grinning devils.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.760
Looking for your utility belts?
They're over here.

23:06.219 --> 23:10.140
Naturally, I removed them
to prevent your escape.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.563
Batman. Sand.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.523
It's starting to pour down.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.699
Your Highness, your alarm is ringing.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.577
I'm well aware of it.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.164
Well, Dynamic Duo, we'll have to leave now...

23:34.372 --> 23:36.750
...if we're to keep to our timetable of crime.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.378
We certainly don't want to disappoint
Mr. Smith, do we?

23:41.755 --> 23:44.549
After all, he's going to be
of invaluable help to us...

23:44.758 --> 23:46.968
...at exactly 5:00 this afternoon.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.181
Some people kill time.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.101
But this time, time is going to kill you.
