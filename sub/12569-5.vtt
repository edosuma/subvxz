designer Arturo Vitalli

00:10.305 --> 00:11.930
should get life in prison

00:08.676 --> 00:11.930

00:12.054 --> 00:14.348
Huh. Maybe he'll

00:14.349 --> 00:16.642
bump into my uncle Lenny.

00:16.768 --> 00:18.187
We all told him making

00:18.188 --> 00:19.604
his own lottery tickets

was a bad

03:32.214 --> 03:33.672

03:53.943 --> 03:57.822
without consulting me?

07:25.927 --> 07:26.989
of this moment,

but Ravi wasn't here,

07:28.450 --> 07:29.783
we were fighting aliens.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.743
- And you were
- in a bikini.

people actually

07:39.251 --> 07:42.713
believe I shave!

07:42.838 --> 07:44.882
And go to gym class!

07:56.227 --> 07:57.602
walking the runway

07:54.850 --> 07:57.602
since I could crawl.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.785
on your new line.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.454

08:16.602 --> 08:17.622
on a spa weekend

08:17.748 --> 08:19.666
- right after
- the fashion show?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.231
You can tell me

08:21.232 --> 08:22.669

08:42.921 --> 08:43.941
you can do it.

- Is Emma's bike really - the
only other one - We have?

You're gonna

08:54.911 --> 08:56.828
be humiliated anyway,

08:52.991 --> 08:56.828
so what's the diff?

08:59.623 --> 09:00.916

best about it.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.862
stop and let me pose.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.050
Oh, Luke, you have

16:28.051 --> 16:29.113
a thread hanging.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.113
Let me get that.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.366
Oh, oh, um, uh...

16:42.335 --> 16:43.461
(FABRIC RIPPING)

16:47.716 --> 16:49.009
In hindsight, maybe

16:49.010 --> 16:50.301
I should have just

16:47.716 --> 16:50.301
let that thread go.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.119
Okay, the audience

16:55.120 --> 16:56.808
is laughing

16:56.934 --> 16:58.685
with delight

16:58.810 --> 16:59.854
at this sneak peek

16:59.855 --> 17:00.896
at Christina's new

16:58.810 --> 17:00.896
underwear line.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.002
How brilliant

17:03.003 --> 17:04.983
is Christina Ross?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.387
- About as brilliant - as panda undies on
- A 13-year-old.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.906
- Go out there and
- rescue Diamond!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.217
- Try to make it look like
- part of the show!

17:13.241 --> 17:14.785
I am on it.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.307
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

17:41.937 --> 17:43.647
Point Ravi.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.231
Now it is over.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.737
(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)

17:54.032 --> 17:55.430
Love what you

17:55.431 --> 17:56.827
did out there.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.262
- Now let's get you - changed into your
- Showstopper outfit.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.226
Hello!

18:00.227 --> 18:02.165
The show already stopped!

18:02.290 --> 18:04.021
Nobody here is professional,

18:04.022 --> 18:05.752
except that guy. I quit!

18:05.877 --> 18:06.877
Call me!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.234
- Holy Vera Wang! - Do you know
- What just happened?

18:12.258 --> 18:13.781
Yes! Diamond wants to

18:13.782 --> 18:15.303
break off a piece of this!

18:17.722 --> 18:19.641
- She even has
- a pet name for me.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.892
That Guy!

18:21.768 --> 18:22.894
Ah!

18:25.188 --> 18:26.273
Honey, let go

18:26.274 --> 18:27.357
of the runway.

18:28.817 --> 18:29.860
Please.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.114
And wearing our

18:34.115 --> 18:36.157
final outfit

18:32.070 --> 18:36.157
of the night,

18:36.282 --> 18:38.034
please welcome back

18:36.282 --> 18:39.786
Diamond Bloodworth!

18:42.163 --> 18:44.083
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your show.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.174
Wah!

18:56.720 --> 18:57.763
Bad things happening

18:57.764 --> 18:58.805
to pretty people?

18:59.764 --> 19:00.974
I love fashion shows!

19:07.355 --> 19:09.086
They're fleeing like

19:09.087 --> 19:10.817
rats off the Titanic!

19:10.942 --> 19:12.424
On the bright side,

19:12.425 --> 19:13.904
I am dating a model.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.154
High-five!

19:17.908 --> 19:19.158
Christina, I'm so sorry.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.083
- Diamond quit and I
- didn't know what to do!

19:21.411 --> 19:22.579
Christina?

19:22.704 --> 19:24.664
Is that Kitty Couture?

19:24.789 --> 19:27.251
And as you can see,

19:27.252 --> 19:29.711
people are running out

19:24.789 --> 19:29.711
to buy these clothes,

19:29.836 --> 19:31.170
- proving that
- Christina Ross...

19:31.295 --> 19:33.172
- Is on her way
- over here! Run!

19:34.298 --> 19:35.383
(GASPS)

19:35.508 --> 19:36.801
Emma?

19:36.927 --> 19:39.971
You're Kitty Couture?

19:40.097 --> 19:41.139
Surprise.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.977
You came here

19:44.978 --> 19:46.603
to trash my show?

19:46.728 --> 19:47.938
Of course not!

19:48.063 --> 19:49.086
How could you not

19:49.087 --> 19:50.107
know about this?

19:50.273 --> 19:52.233
- The last two days
- are kind of blurry.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.402
I lost a lot of blood

19:53.403 --> 19:54.444
when you made me

19:52.358 --> 19:54.444
a human pincushion.

19:55.403 --> 19:56.988
(GROANS)

19:57.114 --> 19:59.032
- Could things get
- any worse?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.159
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:01.993 --> 20:04.621
(CRASHING)

20:04.746 --> 20:05.747
I think you just lost

20:05.748 --> 20:06.748
the deposit on the tent.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.659
Mom, I didn't say

20:21.660 --> 20:22.889
anything bad

20:20.428 --> 20:22.889
about your clothes.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.976
Honey, I know.

20:25.977 --> 20:28.937
I just saw your vlog,

20:23.014 --> 20:28.937
and you were very sweet.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.230
Why didn't you just tell me

20:30.231 --> 20:31.397
my designs were horrible?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.692
I tried.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.360
- But when you
- get into work mode,

20:36.486 --> 20:37.779
You're not

20:37.780 --> 20:39.072
the easiest person

20:36.486 --> 20:39.072
to talk to.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.803
Hmm. You know, that's

20:40.804 --> 20:42.408
what my last seven

20:39.197 --> 20:42.408
assistants said

20:42.533 --> 20:44.035
right before they quit.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.162
Which doesn't make

20:45.163 --> 20:46.163
any sense to me,

20:46.287 --> 20:48.039
- because I am a very
- considerate boss.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.335
- Help.
- Knees buckling.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.878
Tendons snapping.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.964
Not now, Jessie!

20:56.089 --> 20:57.174
We're having a

20:57.175 --> 20:58.257
mother-daughter moment.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.593
(KITTEN YOWLING)

21:02.887 --> 21:04.305
I must've missed one.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.515
Pipe down, Fluffy.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.185
(PHONE BEEPS)

21:08.309 --> 21:09.769
Jessie, look,

21:09.770 --> 21:11.229
Mom became a fan

21:08.309 --> 21:11.229
of Kitty Couture!

21:11.354 --> 21:12.626
And I'm an even

21:12.627 --> 21:13.898
bigger fan of yours.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.942
I'm so proud of you.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.402
Oh! This reminds me of

21:17.403 --> 21:18.736
the time my dad and I

21:18.862 --> 21:20.217
bonded over Stingers being

21:20.218 --> 21:21.572
our favorite

21:18.862 --> 21:21.572
surface-to air missiles!

21:23.574 --> 21:25.702
Anywho,

21:25.703 --> 21:27.829
I'm going to be

21:23.574 --> 21:27.829
more collaborative.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.060
You know what,

21:29.061 --> 21:30.165
I'm creating a new

21:27.954 --> 21:30.165
position in my company:

21:30.289 --> 21:31.958
Teen Fashion Consultant.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.918
- A promotion?
- Oh! I'm so flattered.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.088
And you meant Emma.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.528
I'll get it

21:38.529 --> 21:39.841
one of these days.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.407
- We're gonna - work together?
- Yup.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.220
Thanks, Mom!

21:48.016 --> 21:51.019
Oh, poor Luke.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.816
Okay, we're gonna need

21:56.817 --> 21:58.276
a spatula and some lard.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.948
This is exhilarating!

22:02.949 --> 22:04.657
I feel so alive!

22:04.782 --> 22:05.825
Oh, whoa!

22:07.202 --> 22:09.162
I'm so proud of you!

22:09.287 --> 22:10.831
Aren't you glad

22:10.832 --> 22:12.373
I finally taught you

22:09.287 --> 22:12.373
how to ride a bike?

22:12.498 --> 22:14.375
- Who's my
- special little guy?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.753
I am!

22:16.878 --> 22:18.213
Whoa! Whoa!

Bertram!

22:21.968 --> 22:23.051
Are you okay?

22:25.511 --> 22:26.825
Wait a minute.

22:26.826 --> 22:28.139
Where's the seat?
