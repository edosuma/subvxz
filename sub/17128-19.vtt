09:44.054 --> 09:46.286
STUPID HAT DAY
IS TOMORROW.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.693
COME ON, ANGIE.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.695
STOP MAKING A SCENE.
WRAP YOURSELF.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.966
STOP IT.

10:02.132 --> 10:03.734
HEY, HONEY.

10:03.734 --> 10:04.935
HEY.

10:04.935 --> 10:07.137
ARE YOU WRITING
YOUR APOLOGY LETTER?

10:07.137 --> 10:08.308
YES.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.880
HOW´S THIS?

10:09.880 --> 10:14.014
DEAR LAWRENCE,
THIS IS AN APOLOGY.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.386
DO NOT EAT THIS LETTER.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.321
JUST WRITE
A REAL APOLOGY.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.854
I DON´T WANT PRINCIPAL STOLLER
TO BE MAD AT ME.

10:23.854 --> 10:25.295
I HAVE TO FACE HER

10:25.295 --> 10:27.157
EVERY TIME I VOLUNTEER
AT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY.

10:27.157 --> 10:28.829
YOU KNOW, ANGIE,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

10:28.829 --> 10:30.100
I GOT MADE FUN OF
ALL THE TIME,

10:30.100 --> 10:31.732
AND NOBODY EVER TOLD ME
THEY WERE SORRY.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.904
MY SCIENCE TEACHER
NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING,

10:33.904 --> 10:37.007
"KIDS, TODAY I´M GOING
TO TEACH YOU ABOUT AN ECLIPSE.

10:37.007 --> 10:40.310
LOPEZ, PUT YOUR HEAD
IN FRONT OF THE SUN."

10:41.972 --> 10:43.313
AND THEN IT GOT DARK,

10:43.313 --> 10:47.317
AND NOBODY COULD SEE
MY TEARS WELLING UP.

10:47.317 --> 10:48.949
HONEY.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.021
I LOVE YOUR BIG HEAD.

10:52.182 --> 10:56.957
LOOK, IT HAS
ITS OWN GRAVITATIONAL PULL.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.659
TODAY WAS THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.161
LET ME GUESS --

11:01.161 --> 11:03.894
I MADE FUN OF SOME KIDS,
SO TODAY THEY MADE FUN OF YOU.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.665
BUT, HONEY,
ISN´T IT POSSIBLE

11:05.665 --> 11:08.969
THAT THEY WERE JUST GOING
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU ANYWAY?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.400
NO.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.803
LOOK WHAT´S POSTED
ON THE SCHOOL´S WEB SITE.

11:15.105 --> 11:17.207
ALL RIGHT, SOME KID
PUT A PICTURE OF A HOT CHICK

11:17.207 --> 11:20.050
IN A WET T-SHIRT
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE -- ANGIE!

11:21.681 --> 11:25.015
THAT´S ME
GETTING OUT OF THE DUNK TANK.

11:25.015 --> 11:28.989
YOU COULD SEE
RIGHT THROUGH MY SHIRT.

11:28.989 --> 11:29.990
WHO DID THIS?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.261
I DON´T KNOW,

11:31.261 --> 11:32.793
BUT EVERY KID IN SCHOOL
HAS SEEN IT.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.194
WELL, NOBODY DOES THIS
TO MY WIFE.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.896
SOMEBODY´S GOING
TO PAY FOR THIS.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.367
HA HA HA.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.129
OOH, YEAH.

11:39.129 --> 11:42.002
I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS
WHO´LL PAY FOR THAT.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.706
IF I WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE
PICTURES OF MY WIFE LIKE THAT,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.779
I WOULD HAVE
MARRIED A PLAYMATE.

11:48.779 --> 11:49.840
YEAH.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.112
THAT´S WHAT STOPPED YOU.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.245
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

11:57.047 --> 11:58.188
HEY, JASON.

11:58.188 --> 11:59.419
HEY, CARMEN.
HEY, MR. LOPEZ.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.150
HEY.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.721
MRS. LOPEZ.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.957
JASON, IT´S OKAY.
YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.

12:06.957 --> 12:09.159
I DIDN´T SEE
THE PICTURE.

12:09.159 --> 12:12.732
THEN WHY CAN´T YOU
LOOK AT ME?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.264
OKAY, I SAW IT.

12:14.264 --> 12:16.006
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
ONE OF THE GUYS

12:16.006 --> 12:18.138
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM
MADE IT INTO A LIFE-SIZE POSTER

12:18.138 --> 12:19.840
AND PUT IT UP
IN THE SHOWER.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.042
THAT´S IT.
I´M GOING DOWN TO THAT SCHOOL,

12:22.042 --> 12:23.213
AND I´M GOING
TO BUST SOME HEADS.

12:23.213 --> 12:24.744
WHOSE HEADS?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.376
WE DON´T EVEN KNOW
WHO´S RESPONSIBLE.

12:26.376 --> 12:28.248
ACTUALLY, THAT´S WHY
I CAME OVER.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.781
YOU KNOW THAT BIG KID
MR. LOPEZ WAS MAKING FUN OF?

12:30.781 --> 12:32.853
MY BROTHER SAW HIM
AT THE DUNK TANK

12:32.853 --> 12:34.024
WITH A CAMERA PHONE.

12:34.024 --> 12:35.385
LAWRENCE.

12:35.385 --> 12:37.427
ANGIE, I´M GOING
TO GET THAT DIRECTORY,

12:37.427 --> 12:39.389
AND I´M GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF LAWRENCE.

12:39.389 --> 12:41.531
YOU´RE NOT GOING
TO DO ANYTHING.

12:41.531 --> 12:44.134
YOU´VE DONE ENOUGH.
I WILL HANDLE THIS.

12:44.134 --> 12:45.335
BUT, BABY,

12:45.335 --> 12:47.497
I GOT THIS.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.942
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT,

12:51.942 --> 12:53.874
BUT YOU NEVER HAVE IT.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.275
EVER.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.349
SOMETIMES I HAVE IT.

12:59.349 --> 13:01.311
I JUST DON´T ALWAYS
BRAG ABOUT IT.

13:01.311 --> 13:03.884
AND SOMETIMES
I JUST HAVE IT.

13:08.318 --> 13:09.890
YOU JUST CLICK ONCE

13:09.890 --> 13:11.922
AND DRAG IT
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

13:11.922 --> 13:14.925
IT´S REALLY EASY TO PUT A HEAD
ON SOMEONE ELSE´S BODY. MM-HMM.

13:14.925 --> 13:16.396
OH, SEE HERE?

13:16.396 --> 13:20.570
MICHAEL JACKSON
DANGLING CARMEN FROM A BALCONY.

13:22.432 --> 13:24.504
ALL RIGHT, THAT´S GREAT, MAN.
SCOOT OVER.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.436
HEY, ERNIE, YOU GOT
LAWRENCE´S PICTURE

13:26.436 --> 13:28.208
FROM CARMEN´S YEARBOOK?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.379
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, DAD?

13:29.379 --> 13:31.511
OKAY, WATCH THIS.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.383
ALL RIGHT,
SEE THE MAMA PIG

13:33.383 --> 13:36.316
SUCKLING HER
10 LITTLE PIGLETS?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.919
THERE´S LAWRENCE
SUCKLING 10 LITTLE PIGLETS.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.121
HA HA HA HA HA!

13:41.121 --> 13:43.453
OH, HEY, PUT HIS HEAD
ON THE PICTURE

13:43.453 --> 13:45.956
OF THOSE TWO PIGS
PLAYING LEAPFROG --

13:45.956 --> 13:51.161
THE ONE WHERE IT SAYS
"MAKIN´ BACON."

13:51.161 --> 13:53.063
THEY´RE NOT PLAYING
LEAPFROG, MAX.

13:53.063 --> 13:55.305
THOSE PIGS ARE -- AY!

13:55.305 --> 13:56.867
OKAY.

13:56.867 --> 13:59.239
HERE´S 5 BUCKS, OKAY?
YOU WERE NEVER HERE.

14:01.211 --> 14:02.612
LET´S GO
TO THE ALLENDALE WEB SITE

14:02.612 --> 14:04.274
AND POST THIS,

14:04.274 --> 14:06.516
´CAUSE YOU DON´T MESS
WITH GEORGE LOPEZ´S LADY,

14:06.516 --> 14:08.378
BECAUSE I´M HARD
LIKE THAT.

14:08.378 --> 14:09.849
THAT´S RIGHT.
THAT´S WHAT I´M TALKING ABOUT.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.481
NOBODY MESSES WITH US.
WE´RE LIKE --

14:11.481 --> 14:13.583
Angie: ANYBODY HOME?

14:13.583 --> 14:15.525
SEND IT! SEND IT QUICK!
HIT RETURN -- RIGHT THERE!

14:19.459 --> 14:21.361
SO HOW DID IT GO
AT SCHOOL?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.193
I MET WITH THE PRINCIPAL,

14:23.193 --> 14:25.595
AND SHE´S GOING
TO TALK TO LAWRENCE.

14:25.595 --> 14:27.597
AND TOMORROW, I´M GOING
TO WORK AT THE LIBRARY

14:27.597 --> 14:29.599
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

14:29.599 --> 14:31.601
I´M NOT GOING TO LET
SOME STUPID TEENAGE PRANK

14:31.601 --> 14:33.373
CHANGE MY LIFE.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.604
GOOD FOR YOU.

14:34.604 --> 14:39.049
THANK YOU
FOR NOT INTERFERING.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.481
I HAD TO DO THIS
MY WAY.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.053
YOU´RE RIGHT, BABY.

14:43.053 --> 14:46.056
LOOK, YOU HAVE YOUR WAY,
AND I HAVE MINE, OKAY?

14:46.056 --> 14:48.518
IF WE BOTH RESPECT THAT,
I´LL NEVER HAVE TO SLEEP

14:48.518 --> 14:51.992
ON THE WEIGHT BENCH
IN THE GARAGE.

14:54.524 --> 14:55.966
HEY, MRS. LOPEZ.

14:55.966 --> 14:57.367
ANY BETTER TODAY, HONEY?

14:57.367 --> 14:59.199
WELL, UM...

14:59.199 --> 15:00.330
DURING
THE MORNING ASSEMBLY,

15:00.330 --> 15:02.102
THE PRINCIPAL
POINTED AT ME

15:02.102 --> 15:05.075
AND TOLD EVERYONE TO STOP
MAKING FUN OF CARMEN LOPEZ.

15:05.075 --> 15:06.406
THAT HELPED.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.412
I´LL GO UPSTAIRS
AND TALK TO HER.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.315
OH, THANK GOD.
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY TURN.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.347
IT IS YOUR TURN.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.089
YEAH, BUT YOU´RE ALREADY
RIGHT THERE BY THE STAIRS,

15:19.089 --> 15:20.420
SO JUST GO.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.123
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.155
YEAH, I DON´T THINK CARMEN´S
IN THE MOOD TO HANG OUT.

15:25.155 --> 15:27.327
PEOPLE WERE GIVING HER CRAP
ABOUT THAT PICTURE ALL DAY.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.029
YEAH, WELL,
DON´T WORRY.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.961
THEY´LL BE TALKING ABOUT
ANOTHER PICTURE TOMORROW.

15:30.961 --> 15:32.362
CHECK THIS OUT.

15:32.362 --> 15:35.705
I JUST POSTED THIS
ON THE SCHOOL´S WEB SITE.

15:35.705 --> 15:37.968
OOH.

15:37.968 --> 15:39.439
HEY, THAT´S LAWRENCE.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.412
HE´S NURSING PIGLETS.

15:42.412 --> 15:46.276
WHO KNEW HE WAS
SUCH A NURTURING MOTHER?

15:46.276 --> 15:48.548
MR. LOPEZ,
THAT´S KIND OF HARSH.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.081
THE GUY JUST MADE
ONE MISTAKE.

15:51.081 --> 15:54.024
ONE MISTAKE? DID YOU SEE
WHAT HE DID TO MRS. LOPEZ?

15:54.024 --> 15:55.585
LET HIM SUFFER.

15:55.585 --> 15:59.389
I MEAN HE ALREADY GETS TEASED
A LOT BECAUSE OF HIS WEIGHT.

15:59.389 --> 16:00.690
WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

16:00.690 --> 16:02.292
BEFORE HE TOOK
THAT PICTURE.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.465
BUT WE´RE NOT REALLY SURE
HE DID IT.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.638
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU SAW HIM
WITH A CAMERA PHONE.

16:08.638 --> 16:11.471
WELL, I DID,
BUT THAT DOESN´T MEAN ANYTHING.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.743
A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE CAMERA PHONES.

16:13.743 --> 16:16.476
LOOK, I JUST SENT OUT PICTURES
OF THIS KID AS A PIG

16:16.476 --> 16:18.008
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID.

16:18.008 --> 16:20.350
I DIDN´T KNOW
YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.482
I WOULDN´T HAVE
SAID ANYTHING.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.557
DO YOU HAVE
A CAMERA PHONE, ERIC?

16:27.557 --> 16:31.991
I THINK
I LEFT THE VAN RAMP DOWN.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.763
NOT SO FAST, IRONSIDE!

16:38.498 --> 16:41.101
WHAT´S GOING ON, ERIC?

16:41.101 --> 16:43.373
I TOOK THE PICTURE.

16:43.373 --> 16:45.705
I´M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.536
YOU LITTLE --

16:46.536 --> 16:48.238
OKAY, FAIR FIGHT.

16:48.238 --> 16:49.639
ROLL INTO THIS!

16:53.183 --> 16:54.644
WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:54.644 --> 16:57.717
IT WAS HIM, ANGIE.
ERIC TOOK THAT PICTURE OF YOU.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.549
WHAT?

16:59.549 --> 17:02.422
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

17:02.422 --> 17:04.494
I DON´T KNOW.
I THOUGHT IT´D BE FUNNY.

17:04.494 --> 17:07.457
I´M REALLY SORRY,
MRS. LOPEZ.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.399
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

17:09.399 --> 17:11.731
WELL...

17:11.731 --> 17:15.665
AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU´VE DONE IS WRONG,

17:15.665 --> 17:17.207
I GUESS...

17:17.207 --> 17:20.470
WE CAN LET THIS GO.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.112
MRS. LOPEZ,

17:22.112 --> 17:23.473
IF YOU DON´T TREAT HIM
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE,

17:23.473 --> 17:25.575
YOU´RE NOT DOING HIM
ANY FAVORS.

17:27.577 --> 17:31.081
YOU DROOLING
LITTLE WEASEL!

17:33.353 --> 17:35.485
I WORKED THAT STUPID BOOTH
ALL DAY

17:35.485 --> 17:37.557
TO HELP RAISE MONEY
TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.289
AND THIS IS
HOW YOU PAY ME BACK?

17:39.289 --> 17:40.530
I HAVE HALF A MIND

17:40.530 --> 17:42.362
TO TIE YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK

17:42.362 --> 17:44.694
AND PUSH YOU
INTO A POOL.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.599
THAT WOULD KILL HIM.

17:49.599 --> 17:51.601
WELL, TOMORROW MORNING,

17:51.601 --> 17:53.443
I AM TAKING YOU
TO THE PRINCIPAL.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.705
I WOULDN´T BE SURPRISED
IF YOU GOT SUSPENDED.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.707
CAN WE GO
IN THE AFTERNOON?

17:57.707 --> 18:00.450
I HAVE NEUROMUSCULAR THERAPY
IN THE MORNING.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.493
WELL...

18:13.493 --> 18:15.525
LET´S JUST FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED, HUH?

18:15.525 --> 18:18.328
THANK YOU.
IT WAS JUST A DUMB PRANK.

18:18.328 --> 18:21.471
I NEVER EXPECTED
ALL THOSE KIDS TO TEASE CARMEN.

18:21.471 --> 18:24.334
OH, AND THAT PICTURE OF LAWRENCE
MR. LOPEZ PUT ON THE INTERNET --

18:24.334 --> 18:25.635
AHEM.

18:28.238 --> 18:29.679
WHAT PICTURE?

18:29.679 --> 18:32.342
LET´S REMEMBER WHO
THE REAL VILLAIN IS HERE --

18:32.342 --> 18:34.884
THE KID IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.820
WHAT PICTURE?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.493
ANGIE...

18:43.493 --> 18:45.295
THERE IS
NO MORE NOBLE ACTION

18:45.295 --> 18:47.657
THAN TO DEFEND
THE HONOR AND VIRTUE

18:47.657 --> 18:49.699
OF THE WOMAN
THAT YOU LOVE.

18:49.699 --> 18:52.902
I PUT THE BOY´S HEAD
ON A PICTURE OF A...

18:52.902 --> 18:55.535
MOTHER PIG OFFERING
ONE OF HER MANY MILK NOZZLES

18:55.535 --> 18:57.407
TO HER YOUNG.

18:59.539 --> 19:03.643
I DARE YOU
TO FIND FAULT WITH THAT.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.545
TO THE WEIGHT BENCH.

19:11.781 --> 19:14.184
GEORGE,
LAWRENCE IS HERE.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.526
OH, ANGIE,
DO I HAVE TO?

19:16.526 --> 19:17.927
YES, YOU DO.

19:17.927 --> 19:19.789
ALL RIGHT,
BUT IF YOU GO OUT THERE

19:19.789 --> 19:21.531
AND YOU DON´T SEE ME,
AND THERE´S A BIG LUMP

19:21.531 --> 19:23.193
IN LAWRENCE´S THROAT,
CALL THE COPS.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.640
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.641
YES, I DID.

19:31.641 --> 19:32.842
LISTEN, LAWRENCE,

19:32.842 --> 19:34.944
I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE,
OKAY?

19:34.944 --> 19:36.946
AND WHAT I DID
WAS INSENSITIVE,

19:36.946 --> 19:39.649
AND I WANTED
TO CALL YOU OVER HERE

19:39.649 --> 19:41.481
TO TELL YOU I´M SORRY,

19:41.481 --> 19:43.783
AND TO GIVE YOU A...

19:43.783 --> 19:47.957
