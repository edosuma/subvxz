WEBVTT

00:01.575 --> 00:03.562
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:03.682 --> 00:05.909
- Go! Come on!
- Go!

00:06.029 --> 00:07.774
Does this mean you've changed
your mind about working with me?

00:07.894 --> 00:08.730
I don't trust you.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.000
And whoever I was before,
I don't trust her, either.

00:12.424 --> 00:14.625
I'm dating your sister. I've been
meaning to tell you for weeks.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.786
I spoke to Reade. He told
me things were serious.

00:16.906 --> 00:19.058
The last thing that I
want is you or Sawyer

00:19.178 --> 00:20.378
to lose someone that you love.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.913
Been looking into
Carter's disappearance,

00:22.033 --> 00:24.016
and I can't find any
evidence as to where he was

00:24.136 --> 00:26.270
in the hours before his car
showed up on that bridge,

00:26.390 --> 00:28.121
but there's a bunch of
traffic cameras near it.

00:28.241 --> 00:31.555
If you find anything, you
bring it to me and only me.

00:31.675 --> 00:34.247
- This the guy you're looking for?
- No, that's his car.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.067
So who the hell are you?

00:37.892 --> 00:39.815
The people we work with
will stop at nothing

00:39.935 --> 00:41.409
to make sure this plan succeeds.

00:41.529 --> 00:44.955
If you refuse to cooperate,
they'll kill Agent Weller.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.771
I was starting to think
you weren't gonna show.

00:53.891 --> 00:56.550
Well, you made it pretty
clear I didn't have a choice.

00:56.670 --> 00:58.383
What do you want?

00:58.503 --> 01:01.114
I need you to install this
in your team's vehicle.

01:01.234 --> 01:03.247
- What is it?
- A GPS tracker.

01:03.367 --> 01:06.317
So we can more effectively
keep tabs on your whereabouts.

01:06.437 --> 01:08.151
You think I'm stupid?

01:08.271 --> 01:11.071
That's not to follow
me, it's to follow them.

01:15.219 --> 01:17.251
You install it in the vehicle's ECU,

01:17.371 --> 01:19.296
behind the glove box and
next to the fuse board.

01:19.416 --> 01:22.315
It looks just like the
chip you'll be replacing.

01:22.435 --> 01:24.702
Okay, listen, I...

01:24.822 --> 01:26.603
I know what I said
last night may have...

01:26.723 --> 01:29.988
- eroded some trust between us.
- No.

01:30.304 --> 01:31.804
I never trusted you.

- <i>(electronic voice) How's your head?</i>

01:49.379 --> 01:52.159
<i>Stop looking into Tom
Carter's disappearance...</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:54.629
<i>or people you love will start to die.</i>

01:56.119 --> 01:59.021
<i>Or I could just kill you
now with your own gun.</i>

01:59.141 --> 02:01.732
- (trigger clicks)
- <i>Remember that sound...</i>

02:01.852 --> 02:04.894
<i>how easy it was to get to you.</i>

02:05.014 --> 02:07.772
<i>We'll be watching, Agent Reade.</i>

02:18.342 --> 02:20.013
(cellphone chimes)

02:20.861 --> 02:23.311
_

02:48.501 --> 02:52.174
(canvas tearing)

02:56.450 --> 02:58.326
So you called me in here

02:58.446 --> 03:01.507
before the crack of dawn
to tell me you have nothing?

03:01.627 --> 03:05.027
The DOT guys told me they
found this new camera, and I...

03:07.288 --> 03:09.909
I jumped the gun,
there was nothing there.

03:10.029 --> 03:12.979
I've had it in for Jane
ever since she got here.

03:13.564 --> 03:16.547
When Fisher brought up
all the Carter stuff, I...

03:16.933 --> 03:18.676
kinda wanted it to be true.

03:18.796 --> 03:20.260
Been all over Weller
about his lack of judgment

03:20.380 --> 03:22.627
when it comes to Jane, but the truth is,

03:22.747 --> 03:24.997
I've been guilty of the same thing.

03:26.024 --> 03:28.125
So you don't think
Jane had anything to do

03:28.245 --> 03:30.145
with Carter's disappearance?

03:34.714 --> 03:36.066
No, ma'am.

03:36.186 --> 03:39.236
The next time you get
a moment of clarity,

03:39.356 --> 03:41.223
tell it to your diary.

03:41.423 --> 03:42.853
Dismissed.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.524
Okay. What do we have?

03:50.644 --> 03:53.183
This is something. This is big.

03:53.403 --> 03:56.520
I mean, I don't even... Yes, okay.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.307
This is security footage

03:58.427 --> 04:02.561
last night from a high-end
contemporary art gallery in Chelsea.

04:02.681 --> 04:04.939
So this gentleman in the pig mask

04:05.059 --> 04:08.100
took great pains to break
in and steal one painting

04:08.220 --> 04:11.169
from the new ZOMO exhibit
set to open this morning.

04:11.289 --> 04:14.324
- ZOMO? Why do I know that name?
- He started out as a graffiti artist

04:14.444 --> 04:17.107
before the art world turned
him into a media darling.

04:17.226 --> 04:20.735
Super elusive. No one even
knows his real identity.

04:20.855 --> 04:24.000
Okay, so... what did pig boy take?

04:24.120 --> 04:25.492
That's where we come in.

04:25.612 --> 04:30.259
He stole ZOMO's newest piece,
which was included at the last minute.

04:31.195 --> 04:33.225
(beeping)

04:35.879 --> 04:37.229
The burning rose.

04:37.726 --> 04:39.785
<i>That's right. The burning rose.</i>

04:39.905 --> 04:41.418
This is nearly an exact depiction

04:41.538 --> 04:43.989
of one of the most prominent
tattoos on your body.

04:44.109 --> 04:48.604
The thief walked past paintings worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars

04:48.724 --> 04:51.424
and ripped this one
right out of the frame.

04:52.352 --> 04:54.400
(police radio chatter)

05:00.743 --> 05:02.021
Excuse me.

05:02.249 --> 05:04.526
- Are you with the FBI?
- Yes, we are.

05:04.646 --> 05:06.442
Special Agent Weller. You are...

05:06.562 --> 05:08.266
I'm Kristy, ZOMO's assistant.

05:08.386 --> 05:10.562
Perfect. He's gonna have
to come in for questioning.

05:10.682 --> 05:12.589
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Excuse me?

05:12.709 --> 05:16.366
- You need to see that badge again?
- Sorry, um, it's this way.

05:16.785 --> 05:19.472
I didn't mean to... I've worked
for ZOMO for seven years.

05:19.592 --> 05:21.244
No one talks with him,
no one meets with him,

05:21.364 --> 05:22.825
no one knows who he is, including me.

05:22.945 --> 05:24.946
So you don't know who you work for?

05:25.066 --> 05:26.401
Do you know how long this is gonna take?

05:26.521 --> 05:28.230
Because I have, like, a line
of people waiting outside

05:28.350 --> 05:31.630
- to see the missing painting.
- To see what? It's been stolen.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.049
Some things are more
meaningful in their absence.

05:34.169 --> 05:36.481
If you and ZOMO don't
talk to each other,

05:36.601 --> 05:40.060
- how does he communicate with you?
- Postcards, no return address.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.392
"Do this, do that." Um...

05:42.512 --> 05:45.709
This one was attached to the painting
when it was sent to the gallery.

05:45.829 --> 05:48.372
Before it was stolen, obviously.

05:48.492 --> 05:49.992
"Kristy, hang this."

05:51.426 --> 05:53.400
Tasha, bag this.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.772
This guy gets paid, doesn't he?
Where do they send his checks?

05:55.892 --> 05:58.775
ZOMO's a cash-only business.
Deals with a pretty annoying system

05:58.895 --> 06:01.245
of rotating drop points and couriers.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.999
I'm telling you, this guy makes J.D.
Salinger look like an extrovert.

06:04.119 --> 06:06.671
Okay, let's see what we're looking at.

06:06.791 --> 06:09.288
Or... not looking at.

06:09.408 --> 06:12.641
I left my radio in the car,
so I'll meet you in there.

06:15.769 --> 06:16.962
Hey.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.397
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

06:20.521 --> 06:22.571
Then get your head in the game.

06:24.179 --> 06:26.282
(police radio chatter)

06:33.673 --> 06:37.433
If you refuse to cooperate,
they'll kill Agent Weller.

06:44.414 --> 06:46.481
(cellophane crinkling)

06:52.549 --> 06:54.216
(click)

06:54.862 --> 06:57.579
(shuts door) (sighs)

07:05.058 --> 07:07.675
"Ultimatum." What does that mean?

07:08.085 --> 07:09.127
Who knows?

07:09.247 --> 07:11.615
Honestly, it wasn't really one
of my favorite paintings anyway.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.185
Felt a little soft.

07:13.902 --> 07:16.861
I've worked for ZOMO for seven years,
and that self-portrait is the closest

07:16.981 --> 07:18.981
I've ever come to meeting him.

07:20.726 --> 07:23.559
This is the only room that the thief
had blacked out the cameras in.

07:23.679 --> 07:25.566
The burning rose painting
was the only one taken?

07:25.686 --> 07:27.047
Yep.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.667
I would have taken one of his
earlier pieces myself, but...

07:31.180 --> 07:33.455
This statue's been moved.

07:33.575 --> 07:35.315
Um, sculpture.

07:35.871 --> 07:38.127
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

07:38.494 --> 07:40.396
You see those marks?

07:40.697 --> 07:43.299
Hey, whoa, you cannot do that.

07:44.153 --> 07:46.122
Hey, how come the thief
didn't black out this camera?

07:46.242 --> 07:49.090
Um... I don't know. I've
never seen that before.

07:49.210 --> 07:51.460
This doesn't belong in the gallery?

08:01.505 --> 08:03.255
Everyone out! Team, move!

08:03.563 --> 08:04.774
Move!

08:12.627 --> 08:14.027
Is everybody okay?

08:15.354 --> 08:17.568
- I think I'm good.
- All good here.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.582
Help me. Somebody help me!

08:21.702 --> 08:23.472
Reade, call an ambulance!

08:23.592 --> 08:26.475
No. Oh, no. You're gonna be okay.

You're gonna be okay, Kurt.

08:52.094 --> 08:55.607
(siren blaring)

08:55.894 --> 08:57.242
He lost a lot of blood.

08:57.362 --> 09:00.533
But no major organs were hit and, um...

09:00.861 --> 09:02.862
and, uh, he's got one of
the best trauma surgeons

09:02.982 --> 09:06.132
- in the city working on him.
- He's gonna be fine, Sarah.

09:06.252 --> 09:08.815
You sure you're gonna
be all right by yourself?

09:08.935 --> 09:10.969
Yeah, I'm okay. Just catch
the son of a bitch.

09:11.089 --> 09:13.076
We will. I promise.

09:13.559 --> 09:14.938
I love you.

09:16.543 --> 09:18.643
I'll get there as soon as I can.

09:19.699 --> 09:21.066
Yeah, okay.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.456
Bye.

09:28.296 --> 09:30.794
- Hey. How is he?
- Still in surgery.

09:30.914 --> 09:33.459
Until we hear otherwise, we're just
gonna have to take no news as good news.

09:33.579 --> 09:36.551
- We should be there...
- Look, I know this is hard,

09:36.671 --> 09:38.548
but if you want to help Weller,

09:38.668 --> 09:41.301
let's find the person
who did this to him.

09:41.421 --> 09:45.004
Every second we waste
makes that tougher.

09:45.124 --> 09:48.477
Right! So let's drill down.
Who's our prime suspect?

09:48.597 --> 09:50.984
ZOMO, right? He painted the
picture that put us there,

09:51.104 --> 09:53.479
and the bomb was hidden
inside his sculpture.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.235
Okay, did we get any
prints off that last postcard

09:55.355 --> 09:57.020
- he sent to his assistant?
- Just hers.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.393
And with traces of latex.
Same with the painting.

09:59.513 --> 10:01.150
So I guess he's smart
enough to use gloves.

10:01.270 --> 10:05.592
And you still think that the bombing
was specifically targeting us?

10:05.712 --> 10:08.721
Gallery footage confirms that
the camera by the fire alarm

10:08.841 --> 10:12.044
was added after the thief
blacked out the security camera.

10:12.164 --> 10:14.388
And it's hooked up to
a wireless transmitter.

10:14.508 --> 10:16.970
So he could watch and wait for us.

10:17.090 --> 10:20.308
Maybe he just has a thing for
law enforcement in general.

10:20.428 --> 10:22.748
No, he stole one painting.

10:22.868 --> 10:25.757
That one. He wanted our
attention, he wanted us.

10:25.877 --> 10:27.739
And do we know how ZOMO knew

10:27.859 --> 10:29.746
about the image in the first place?

10:29.866 --> 10:32.715
Maybe he was one of the
architects of Jane's tattoos.

10:32.835 --> 10:35.416
But Jane was sent to us.
These tattoos are revealing crimes.

10:35.536 --> 10:37.694
Why suddenly try and kill the
people you're trying to help?

10:37.814 --> 10:40.096
Maybe the person who painted the rose

10:40.216 --> 10:42.725
and the person who stole
it and tried to kill us

10:42.845 --> 10:45.361
- are two different people.
- So, just to recap,

10:45.481 --> 10:48.965
ZOMO did or didn't
design Jane's tattoos,

10:49.085 --> 10:51.811
did or didn't paint the burning rose,

10:51.931 --> 10:56.058
and then did or didn't steal
it and try and blow us up?

10:56.985 --> 10:59.134
Looks like we're making progress.

10:59.254 --> 11:02.658
Look, we know one thing.
We need to find ZOMO.

11:02.778 --> 11:04.399
This is a self-portrait, right?

11:04.519 --> 11:06.268
So maybe there's a clue
as to who he is here.

11:06.388 --> 11:08.318
What, we look for a guy
with an "X" on his face?

11:08.438 --> 11:11.039
How often does ZOMO use
photography in his work?

11:11.159 --> 11:13.122
This is the first instance I've seen.

11:13.242 --> 11:15.523
Other than sculptures, he's
a paint and stencil guy.

11:15.643 --> 11:18.894
What if this photo is the
actual view from his studio?

11:19.014 --> 11:20.569
Find the view, find ZOMO.

11:20.689 --> 11:22.098
That's a hell of a long shot.

11:22.218 --> 11:24.334
It's the only shot we got. Patterson?

11:24.454 --> 11:26.221
Yep, on it.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.692
We ran this photograph from
ZOMO's self-portrait painting

11:30.812 --> 11:33.612
through Bing street
view, and we got a match.

11:34.185 --> 11:37.199
This apartment complex
is on a street in Dumbo.

11:37.319 --> 11:39.367
Based on the height
and angle of the shot,

11:39.487 --> 11:41.951
it had to be from a commercial
loft building across the street.

11:42.071 --> 11:44.988
And get this... The owner said
one of the tenants on the second floor

11:45.108 --> 11:48.179
- pays cash and never shows his face.
- It has to be him.

11:48.299 --> 11:51.044
How do we know that ZOMO doesn't
want us to find this place?

11:51.164 --> 11:54.282
The last time we followed one of
his paintings, it led us to a bomb.

11:54.402 --> 11:57.451
We can't just go in
there waving our FBI flag.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.376
Well, then... let's
not go in as FBI at all.

12:02.995 --> 12:05.144
This dog can really smell bombs?

12:05.264 --> 12:08.964
Well, if it can't, then it's
one terrible bomb-sniffing dog.

12:09.775 --> 12:11.669
- Zapata, you still there?
- Ready and waiting around the block.

12:11.789 --> 12:14.589
- Just say the word.
- <i>We're at the door now.</i>

12:15.303 --> 12:17.397
What do you think, Harvey?

12:18.141 --> 12:20.673
Well, he's not sitting, so... no bomb.

12:20.793 --> 12:22.122
Right.

12:26.493 --> 12:28.250
ZOMO's in there, he's bleeding.

12:28.370 --> 12:29.900
- How bad?
- Bad. He's not gonna last.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.520
Jane, it might be another
trap. What are you doing?

12:31.640 --> 12:35.790
There's no bomb, and he's gonna die
in there. We gotta take that chance.

12:43.332 --> 12:45.116
(gunshot, glass shatters)

12:45.236 --> 12:46.456
Jane!

12:49.781 --> 12:51.373
Shooter in northwest building
across the intersection!

12:51.493 --> 12:54.276
That's the community
center... move! Move!

12:55.511 --> 12:57.343
- Jane!
- (grunting)

12:58.958 --> 13:01.618
- Jane, you all right?
- (gasps) I'm okay.

13:01.738 --> 13:04.067
Uh! I'm okay, it got me in the plates.

13:04.187 --> 13:05.489
Go!

13:31.319 --> 13:34.376
- Where's Zapata?
- Upstairs, I think they got him.

13:49.385 --> 13:51.735
I got a sniper's nest with no sniper.

13:52.913 --> 13:55.808
- He's in the wind.
- I thought you had him.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.748
(gunshots)

14:20.624 --> 14:21.890
Go!

14:32.441 --> 14:34.235
(gunshots)

14:36.091 --> 14:38.493
Shooter's on the street!
The target's not us, it's Jane!

14:38.613 --> 14:41.344
<i>I repeat, the target is Jane Doe!</i>

14:50.338 --> 14:51.888
He's on the move. Go!

14:54.486 --> 14:57.076
- Her comms.
- Where's Jane? Was she hit?

14:57.467 --> 14:58.717
No, she's gone.

15:06.555 --> 15:08.835
(beep)

15:08.955 --> 15:10.536
(police radio chatter)

15:10.656 --> 15:13.506
- Hey, Kurt.
- Welcome back.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.950
It was a trap.

15:15.910 --> 15:18.211
- The bomber was after Jane.
- Easy.

15:18.331 --> 15:20.526
The shrapnel from the
bomb nicked your jugular,

15:20.646 --> 15:22.298
but they were able to repair the damage.

15:22.418 --> 15:23.631
You need to rest, okay?

15:23.751 --> 15:26.853
The doctors said you have
to avoid strenuous activity.

15:27.150 --> 15:28.802
But you're gonna be fine.

15:28.922 --> 15:31.057
Why do you both look so worried, then?

15:31.177 --> 15:34.575
Whoever did this, it wasn't ZOMO.

15:34.695 --> 15:37.163
We just found him
murdered in his studio.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.760
The killer was just using him as bait,

15:39.880 --> 15:42.783
lying in wait with a sniper
rifle across the street.

15:42.903 --> 15:44.170
For Jane.

15:46.039 --> 15:47.306
We got him?

15:48.007 --> 15:49.446
No.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.501
- What else?
- Jane is missing.

15:53.313 --> 15:56.819
- Has he got her?
- No, she ditched her comms

15:56.939 --> 16:00.953
and ran off after the suspect
made a play for her in the street.

16:01.236 --> 16:03.773
She's not running. She's protecting us.

16:03.893 --> 16:06.793
- How can you know that?
- Jane's not a coward.

16:07.795 --> 16:09.527
She's not selfish.

16:09.892 --> 16:13.013
We're only targets by association.

16:13.316 --> 16:17.366
So she's removed her proximity.
She's trying to draw him away from us,

16:17.542 --> 16:20.553
- and now she's out there alone.
- Let us worry about Jane.

16:20.673 --> 16:22.417
You need to take the time to recover.

16:22.537 --> 16:25.339
- Kurt, what are you doing?
- I'll recover later.

16:25.546 --> 16:29.260
- Kurt, come on, you just had surgery.
- You need to stay in that bed.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.380
Keep fighting about it
while I'm getting dressed.

16:40.873 --> 16:42.312
(change clinking)

16:42.432 --> 16:44.160
(phone ringing)

16:49.379 --> 16:52.020
- Joey's Pizza.
- I need to cancel my order.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.374
- Are you sure that's necessary?
- Just tell him.

16:58.879 --> 17:01.161
According to the ID
we found in the studio,

17:01.281 --> 17:04.031
ZOMO's real identity was Eric Buchman.

17:04.151 --> 17:06.800
He was a fine arts student
who flunked out of Columbia

17:06.920 --> 17:08.643
five years ago, apparently to become

17:08.762 --> 17:11.223
one of the most notorious
artists of the 21st century.

17:11.344 --> 17:14.555
More notorious now that he
was murdered in his own studio.

17:14.675 --> 17:19.198
So... first, our mystery man tries
to blow Jane up at the art gallery

17:19.318 --> 17:20.646
and then falls back to plan "B,"

17:20.766 --> 17:22.797
using ZOMO as bait to try
to take her out at his loft?

17:22.916 --> 17:25.051
We need to get Jane back
before he gets to plan "C."

17:25.172 --> 17:27.604
You really think we're gonna find her
if she doesn't want to be found?

17:27.723 --> 17:30.221
No, which means that
we have to find him.

17:30.522 --> 17:31.753
So what do we know?

17:31.873 --> 17:33.961
Almost nothing... He
doesn't leave much behind.

17:34.081 --> 17:36.963
No ID through facial
recognition, no prints.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.848
- What about tracing the sniper rifle?
- No serial number.

17:39.968 --> 17:42.466
We're trying to analyze the fragments
from the gallery explosion.

17:42.586 --> 17:45.606
The shrapnel is a combination
of old steel and aluminum.

17:45.726 --> 17:47.101
From what, we don't know.

17:47.221 --> 17:50.553
They just caught ZOMO's
assistant Kristy at JFK

17:50.673 --> 17:52.765
trying to board a plane to Bhutan.

17:52.833 --> 17:54.200
It's an interesting time for a vacation.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.433
Especially to a country
with no U.S. extradition.

17:57.553 --> 18:00.853
Sounds like we better have
another talk with this girl.

18:14.023 --> 18:15.387
(click)

18:15.507 --> 18:18.157
Is it you? Are your
people trying to take me out?

18:18.277 --> 18:20.743
You think I'd meet you alone
if we were trying to kill you?

18:20.863 --> 18:22.976
- Uhh!
- Don't lie to me.

18:23.096 --> 18:25.531
I remember him from before.
He's part of your group.

18:25.651 --> 18:27.166
Wait. What? Remember who?

18:27.286 --> 18:30.303
The man who just tried to
kill me and my entire team.

18:32.221 --> 18:33.577
Cade.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.008
- It has to be Cade.
- Start talking.

18:36.076 --> 18:37.897
He's one of our founding members.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.823
Integral to the design of this plan.

18:39.943 --> 18:41.628
We should have paid attention
to the warning signs,

18:41.748 --> 18:44.937
but his strengths outweigh his flaws.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.153
- Till they didn't.
- And who made that call?

18:49.772 --> 18:51.257
You did.

18:58.289 --> 19:00.389
Cade was always volatile, but...

19:01.902 --> 19:03.550
after we put you in play at the FBI,

19:03.670 --> 19:05.853
something inside him just... broke.

19:05.973 --> 19:07.921
He started going on
these rants, saying...

19:08.041 --> 19:09.442
it was all a mistake,
that we were no better

19:09.562 --> 19:11.423
than the people we were trying to stop.

19:11.543 --> 19:14.663
And when we wouldn't listen,
he made an early play for your life.

19:16.039 --> 19:17.496
The safe house.

19:18.902 --> 19:22.722
Once Cade splintered off, we couldn't
trust the FBI to keep you safe,

19:22.842 --> 19:25.291
so we sent someone in to move you.

19:25.411 --> 19:27.426
(grunting)

19:28.885 --> 19:32.765
But, as we learned too late,
Cade had gotten there first.

19:38.050 --> 19:39.898
(gunshot)

19:40.930 --> 19:42.305
Uhh!

19:47.381 --> 19:48.814
(both grunting)

19:55.105 --> 19:57.356
You saved my life that night.

19:58.678 --> 20:01.063
After that, Cade disappeared...

20:02.110 --> 20:04.163
and we've been trying
to find him ever since.

20:04.283 --> 20:08.015
We had our own protective detail
keeping an eye on you in the meantime.

20:08.135 --> 20:09.416
I have to tell my team.

20:09.536 --> 20:11.469
Tell them what, that
someone's trying to kill you?

20:11.589 --> 20:15.327
They know that already.
How do you explain the rest? Huh?

20:15.996 --> 20:17.610
How do we stop Cade?

20:17.730 --> 20:19.793
- "We"?
- Yeah, you and me.

20:19.913 --> 20:21.895
I can't go back and
risk endangering my team

20:22.015 --> 20:24.764
while he's still trying
to come after me like this.

20:24.884 --> 20:26.613
We kill him.

20:27.765 --> 20:30.492
People like Cade don't stop for less.

20:30.756 --> 20:35.126
But if we're gonna take him
down, we'll need to gear up.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.900
(door hisses closed)

20:42.244 --> 20:43.750
If you weren't an
accessory to these crimes,

20:43.870 --> 20:46.238
why are you fleeing the country?

20:47.062 --> 20:49.028
My boss just got killed.

20:49.148 --> 20:52.479
<i>I'm out of a job. I wasn't... "fleeing."</i>

20:52.599 --> 20:55.214
This is crazy. He should
still be in the hospital.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.416
Feel free to tell him that.

20:57.946 --> 20:58.865
I'm sure he knows.

20:58.985 --> 21:02.219
How did that burning
rose get on ZOMO's canvas?

21:02.339 --> 21:04.338
Kristy, whoever did this

21:04.458 --> 21:06.812
will be facing charges
of breaking and entering,

21:06.932 --> 21:08.608
robbery, the bombing,

21:08.728 --> 21:10.604
and, now that ZOMO is dead, murder.

21:10.724 --> 21:12.616
I didn't do any of this!

21:13.973 --> 21:15.812
Then talk to us.

21:18.672 --> 21:20.007
Kristy.

21:20.289 --> 21:21.682
Talk!

21:22.368 --> 21:25.644
A few days ago, ZOMO
got an anonymous message.

21:27.790 --> 21:30.163
Threatening to expose
his identity if he didn't

21:30.283 --> 21:32.919
meet him in Carroll Park at 4:00 a.m.

21:33.039 --> 21:36.239
- How did they figure out who he was?
- I don't know.

21:37.495 --> 21:41.460
But he said when he got there,
this guy just handed him a sketch.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.800
And said he wanted him
to paint it for a show.

21:44.998 --> 21:47.488
- The burning rose.
- I don't get it.

21:47.608 --> 21:49.898
Why would ZOMO go to the park
if this guy was threatening him?

21:50.018 --> 21:53.775
Well, ZOMO's whole artistic
life was based on mystery.

21:55.519 --> 21:58.354
My guess, he was too
curious to stay home.

21:58.474 --> 22:01.104
And when he found out he was
being blackmailed to make art,

22:01.224 --> 22:03.691
well, he would have eaten
that up with a spoon.

22:03.811 --> 22:06.023
He told you all this on a postcard?

22:06.763 --> 22:09.155
(crying) It wasn't
supposed to end like this.

22:14.308 --> 22:15.937
You're ZOMO.

22:17.367 --> 22:18.696
Aren't you?

22:19.828 --> 22:22.097
The only prints on that
postcard were yours,

22:22.217 --> 22:23.609
'cause you wrote it.

22:23.729 --> 22:28.886
Who went to the park?
You, or this Eric Buchman front?

22:30.589 --> 22:31.940
Eric.

22:32.332 --> 22:35.591
- But you're the artist.
- I was the artist.

22:39.463 --> 22:43.165
And Eric... wasn't just a front.

22:45.402 --> 22:47.207
He was my boyfriend.

22:47.327 --> 22:51.874
We started ZOMO as an experiment
after we met at Columbia.

22:51.994 --> 22:54.944
And when it caught on...

22:55.753 --> 22:58.080
<i>we wanted to see how
far we could push it.</i>

22:58.200 --> 22:59.448
<i>(sniffling)</i>

23:01.151 --> 23:02.984
I guess we found out.

23:04.935 --> 23:08.085
When they told me Eric was
killed in my studio, I...

23:08.396 --> 23:11.612
I'm sorry, I couldn't
think, I just, I...

23:11.732 --> 23:13.105
I ran.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.245
<i>I just want to disappear. I just...</i>

23:15.365 --> 23:17.883
<i>I just want it all to go away.</i>

23:20.972 --> 23:22.918
Where were you when Eric was killed?

23:23.038 --> 23:25.550
I was at the gallery,

23:26.141 --> 23:28.890
dealing with insurance
for the ZOMO paintings.

23:29.010 --> 23:31.498
We're gonna have to keep
you in protective custody

23:31.618 --> 23:33.502
until this case is resolved.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.184
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:37.087 --> 23:38.480
Okay.

23:41.411 --> 23:44.256
Our suspect had a sketch of the tattoos.

23:44.376 --> 23:46.655
He either had access to Jane's FBI file

23:46.775 --> 23:49.293
or had access to her
before she came to us.

23:49.413 --> 23:51.096
Either way, it's huge.

23:51.216 --> 23:53.802
Weller. Your neck.

23:54.437 --> 23:56.572
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

23:57.273 --> 23:59.687
You're bleeding, you need
to go back to the hospital.

23:59.807 --> 24:01.659
I need to stop this
guy from killing Jane.

24:01.779 --> 24:04.747
After that, I'll go to
whatever hospital you want.

24:04.867 --> 24:07.564
(traffic noise) (country music playing)

24:07.684 --> 24:09.084
<i>♪</i>

24:09.204 --> 24:14.456
<i>♪ Somebody's gonna try
tonight, just wait and see ♪</i>

24:15.926 --> 24:19.330
<i>♪ Somebody's gonna try tonight... ♪</i>

24:19.450 --> 24:21.230
Are you gonna tell me
what we're doing in here?

24:21.350 --> 24:23.199
(door opens)

24:27.042 --> 24:29.382
Well, this can't be good news.

24:31.418 --> 24:32.747
Ohh.

24:41.404 --> 24:43.303
What, I only see you
when you need something?

24:43.423 --> 24:44.653
(chuckling)

24:44.773 --> 24:48.157
Hey, stranger. Oh... right.

24:49.542 --> 24:50.833
Guess I am a stranger.

24:50.953 --> 24:53.366
She's not too happy
with us at the moment.

24:53.486 --> 24:55.350
You warned us that might happen.

24:55.796 --> 24:57.558
We're gonna need some supplies.

24:57.678 --> 24:59.927
I heard. Follow me.

25:00.455 --> 25:04.076
Goes without saying, don't use
your FBI sidearm until this over.

25:04.196 --> 25:08.258
We don't need anyone tracing your
movements through federal bullets.

25:08.378 --> 25:12.436
Ah, we got longarms in the
trunk, in case you need 'em.

25:12.556 --> 25:14.812
And with Cade, you'll need 'em.

25:14.932 --> 25:17.273
This'll get you anywhere
you need to go, and quick.

25:17.393 --> 25:19.137
A little, uh, conspicuous, maybe.

25:19.257 --> 25:20.670
Look, you didn't give me much notice.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.640
So, you don't like it,
you can buy a bus pass.

25:24.561 --> 25:26.289
We got burners, case
you need to reach out,

25:26.409 --> 25:29.209
can't get to a payphone...
One call and toss.

25:29.405 --> 25:31.338
You should have started
with the phones first.

25:31.458 --> 25:34.059
Yeah, it's a little anticlimactic.

25:34.604 --> 25:37.243
All right, buddy, sorry to
steal your toys and run, but...

25:37.363 --> 25:40.134
Hey... Look after him, will you?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.978
- Thank you.
- You got it.

25:43.098 --> 25:44.842
- (machine gun fire)
- Uhh!

25:47.217 --> 25:49.285
(grunting)

25:55.162 --> 25:56.664
Uhh!

26:04.666 --> 26:06.183
(tires screeching)

26:06.303 --> 26:08.671
(groaning and coughing)

26:10.250 --> 26:12.042
(groaning) Oh, I'm sorry.

26:12.162 --> 26:15.678
Oh ho, I'm sorry.
I messed up. I messed up.

26:23.779 --> 26:26.732
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
Cade must have followed me here,

26:26.852 --> 26:30.103
- and he waited for you guys to show.
- This isn't on you, this isn't on you.

26:30.223 --> 26:32.557
(groaning) Don't look at me like that.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.324
I owed you one.

26:36.444 --> 26:38.434
Now we're even.

26:39.109 --> 26:40.630
(groans)

26:42.301 --> 26:43.902
(Oscar crying)

26:45.948 --> 26:47.872
Oscar, I'm so sorry.

26:49.949 --> 26:51.488
We have to go.

26:52.983 --> 26:54.894
(police sirens approaching)

26:55.014 --> 26:56.962
Oscar, we have to go now!

27:04.746 --> 27:06.506
What are you doing?

27:06.626 --> 27:08.254
I'm making it look like
a robbery, so it's easier

27:08.374 --> 27:11.093
to explain in a police report.
Get in the car!

27:15.935 --> 27:19.852
(sirens approaching)

27:21.030 --> 27:23.189
We're gonna have to ditch
this car and steal another one.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.777
We can't risk using it now.

27:29.643 --> 27:32.603
I'm sorry about your friend...
Our... our friend.

27:32.723 --> 27:35.720
But if Cade found Danny,
who else can he find?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.204
(beeping)

27:42.261 --> 27:43.891
What does that mean?

27:49.583 --> 27:51.441
- You found something?
- Maybe.

27:51.561 --> 27:52.912
My team's been working
the metal fragments

27:53.032 --> 27:54.727
and the shrapnel from the Gandhi bomb.

27:54.847 --> 27:57.293
- And?
- They're old. Like, way old.

27:57.413 --> 28:00.039
Based on the shape and the composition,
it looks like they're the offcuts

28:00.159 --> 28:02.760
- from old ACSR conductors.
- Power lines.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.201
There can't be too many places around
the city they could have come from.

28:05.321 --> 28:07.185
- There's four.
- But only one near Carroll Park,

28:07.305 --> 28:09.001
where this guy arranged to meet ZOMO.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.508
- The Red Hook Power Plant.
- Anything else?

28:11.576 --> 28:14.205
Yeah, it's the only one that's
been decommissioned. It's empty.

28:14.325 --> 28:17.046
All right, so send some teams
to those other plants just in case.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.624
Tasha, Reade, you're with me.

28:21.433 --> 28:22.835
Got it.

28:23.719 --> 28:25.275
What's happened now?

28:26.550 --> 28:28.250
They found another body.

28:28.952 --> 28:32.331
One of ours. He was tortured
and killed a few hours ago.

28:32.451 --> 28:34.416
That must be how Cade found Danny.

28:34.536 --> 28:36.700
He knows too much about us.

28:36.820 --> 28:39.770
We can't beat him, not like this.

28:40.723 --> 28:42.586
Every second you're out
here puts you in more danger.

28:42.706 --> 28:44.556
Well, what's the alternative?

28:44.676 --> 28:47.203
I mean, you said it yourself,
he's not gonna stop coming after me.

28:47.323 --> 28:49.279
We stop playing his game.

28:49.752 --> 28:52.475
- We pull you out of the FBI.
- What?

28:52.858 --> 28:55.246
No, I... I thought this mission
was the most important...

28:55.366 --> 28:57.443
If you die, mission fails.

28:58.698 --> 29:02.269
Once we deal with Cade, we'll find
a way to put you back in play.

29:02.634 --> 29:04.997
- I won't leave my team.
- You've already left them.

29:05.117 --> 29:06.831
To protect them, and
it's gonna be hard enough

29:06.951 --> 29:08.155
as it is to explain where I've been.

29:08.275 --> 29:09.603
If I disappear completely,
I might never...

29:09.723 --> 29:11.496
Please. We can't lose you.

29:13.515 --> 29:16.301
I can't lose you. I can't.

29:17.394 --> 29:20.471
- They need me.
- Well, then do it for them.

29:21.778 --> 29:25.476
As long as Cade's alive,
your presence puts them all in danger.

29:27.179 --> 29:29.091
You know I'm right.

29:30.633 --> 29:32.737
We need to find a new car.

29:46.772 --> 29:49.719
- See anything?
- Maybe Patterson was wrong.

29:58.990 --> 30:01.777
Maybe not. Flashlight off.

30:23.534 --> 30:26.070
(alarm sounding)

30:37.766 --> 30:39.869
(bullets ricochet)

30:56.317 --> 30:57.746
On me!

31:11.563 --> 31:13.217
(buzzing)

31:15.220 --> 31:17.422
(door rattling, Weller grunting)

31:19.913 --> 31:21.452
We're trapped.

31:32.714 --> 31:36.952
Sorry, Ms. Weller, it says your brother
checked himself out earlier today.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.456
Wait. It says he was under your care.

31:39.576 --> 31:41.606
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- (phone beeps off)

31:43.318 --> 31:44.738
How is he?

31:46.098 --> 31:47.783
He's not there.

31:48.677 --> 31:50.319
What's he doing?

31:50.778 --> 31:52.736
This was a mistake.
I should be with them.

31:52.856 --> 31:55.143
(beeping)

31:58.865 --> 32:00.404
You're not gonna find out what's wrong?

32:00.524 --> 32:02.479
I'll deal with it once
I've got you secured.

32:02.599 --> 32:04.962
No. I want to know.

32:05.253 --> 32:07.274
- Check in.
- (engine starts)

32:09.840 --> 32:11.974
Check in now!

32:13.113 --> 32:15.343
I'm sick of being kept in the dark.

32:15.607 --> 32:17.118
I want to hear.

32:18.598 --> 32:20.383
Gotta get through that door.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.900
(clanging)

32:23.020 --> 32:25.454
- Come on.
- No signal in or out.

32:25.807 --> 32:27.410
(sighs)

32:27.966 --> 32:29.832
Hey, Weller, why don't you take it easy?

32:30.215 --> 32:33.196
Yes, I'm sure. Cade
just called this line.

32:33.461 --> 32:35.402
Says he's got all
three of them on a ship

32:35.522 --> 32:37.413
by the old Red Hook Power Plant.

32:37.533 --> 32:40.536
We'll handle it. Just get her safe.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.786
- No.
- We have to help them.

32:48.906 --> 32:50.446
No. That's exactly what
Cade wants you to do.

32:50.566 --> 32:51.659
Why do you think he called Hobbes?

32:51.779 --> 32:53.764
You think I don't know
that? It doesn't matter!

32:53.884 --> 32:55.687
You heard him yourself.
They're handling it.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.835
- We'll get him back, I promise.
- How?

32:57.955 --> 33:01.493
You have to trust me on this.
This isn't your fight right now.

33:03.727 --> 33:05.153
Fine.

33:08.202 --> 33:09.695
Stop!

33:10.580 --> 33:13.204
- Back away.
- Taylor, you're not gonna do this.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.544
I don't give up on
my friends for anyone.

33:15.664 --> 33:17.312
They're not your friends, Taylor.

33:22.423 --> 33:24.086
Look, it ain't happening.

33:24.206 --> 33:25.763
We're stuck.

33:25.883 --> 33:27.646
Uhh! (clang)

33:30.152 --> 33:32.755
(clanging)

33:32.953 --> 33:35.638
You hearing that? It's hollow.

33:37.795 --> 33:39.312
- Get over to this side.
- Why?

33:39.432 --> 33:40.862
'Cause of the ricochet.

33:40.982 --> 33:42.402
(gunshot)

33:45.538 --> 33:47.087
Oh, nice.

33:47.207 --> 33:49.133
Think we'd all fit through it?

33:49.253 --> 33:52.074
(panting)

33:52.458 --> 33:54.525
- Let's hope that has gas in it.
- Wait, what?

33:54.645 --> 33:57.280
Help me find a hose
to fit into that hole.

33:57.590 --> 33:59.441
We gotta fill the door with gas.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.982
- That's too thick.
- Look at that.

34:03.756 --> 34:06.363
Here. Try and fit that in that hole.

34:06.483 --> 34:08.038
- Can you do it?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:08.918 --> 34:11.341
Need something to seal it. Got a rag?

34:11.460 --> 34:12.926
Here you go.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.206
All right.

34:15.326 --> 34:16.654
- Weller!
- What?

34:16.774 --> 34:18.530
- Well, see...
- Jane!

34:18.848 --> 34:21.570
- How did she find us?
- Jane! Get us out of here!

34:21.859 --> 34:23.687
Hit that button!

34:23.806 --> 34:25.063
(buzzer)

34:25.184 --> 34:26.684
Down!

34:26.804 --> 34:28.577
(buzzer sounding)

34:28.697 --> 34:30.012
Keep going!

34:32.902 --> 34:35.116
- No!
- Weapon.

34:38.981 --> 34:40.797
No! Jane!

34:40.917 --> 34:42.693
Where's Oscar?

34:43.284 --> 34:44.639
Please.

34:44.759 --> 34:46.859
Not in front of them.
Don't kill me in front of my team.

34:46.978 --> 34:49.079
"Your team." That's interesting.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.565
Where's Oscar?

34:50.685 --> 34:53.722
I want him to watch you die
for what he did to Marcos.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.070
He's not here.

34:55.190 --> 34:57.259
You're lying. Take a walk.

34:57.379 --> 34:59.227
Jane! Jane!

35:00.256 --> 35:01.922
No! Uhh!

35:03.947 --> 35:05.613
(both grunting)

35:09.736 --> 35:11.520
(gunshots)

35:12.883 --> 35:14.195
- All right.
- What?

35:14.315 --> 35:16.145
Okay.

35:16.912 --> 35:18.913
Tasha, hold it in there.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.229
(air hissing)

35:20.623 --> 35:22.284
That's it. That's enough.

35:22.648 --> 35:25.502
- Keep it sealed.
- We gotta fill it up.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.504
Seal the hole. Keep it sealed.

35:28.624 --> 35:31.007
- We got to keep filling that door.
- Yeah.

35:31.127 --> 35:32.837
Okay, stand back here.

35:32.957 --> 35:34.569
Take some cover.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.170
Agh!

35:54.598 --> 35:56.198
(grunting)

36:16.286 --> 36:18.754
- (knife unsheathes)
- (gunshot)

36:21.680 --> 36:23.426
(Weller, distant) Jane!

36:24.099 --> 36:25.894
- Jane!
- No!

36:32.462 --> 36:33.903
Jane! Jane!

36:34.644 --> 36:35.508
Are you hit?

36:35.628 --> 36:37.213
- I heard a gunshot.
- He fell in?

36:37.333 --> 36:39.746
Yeah. I shot him in the stomach.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.573
What the hell are you thinking?

36:50.693 --> 36:52.521
You can't just disappear like that!

36:52.641 --> 36:53.631
I was trying to protect...

36:53.751 --> 36:54.915
It was reckless!

36:55.035 --> 36:56.445
You can't take those risks.

36:56.565 --> 36:58.033
It is not your call.

36:58.153 --> 36:59.794
(chair squeaks)

37:04.292 --> 37:05.366
You're right.

37:05.486 --> 37:08.398
How did you trace the
team to the power plant?

37:08.518 --> 37:10.665
I didn't... I tracked the assassin

37:10.785 --> 37:12.577
from ZOMO's studio back to the ship.

37:12.697 --> 37:14.016
I was surveilling him,
trying to figure out

37:14.052 --> 37:16.079
what he was up to,
when the team showed up.

37:16.199 --> 37:17.953
Why didn't you alert
us to your presence?

37:18.073 --> 37:21.209
I couldn't without
alerting him to yours.

37:21.329 --> 37:22.812
And then when you guys didn't come out,

37:22.932 --> 37:25.848
I waited for the right moment
and I went in after you.

37:26.707 --> 37:30.652
Do something like that
again, and you're done.

37:37.186 --> 37:38.724
I'm sorry.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.983
Are you okay?

37:43.365 --> 37:46.306
No. I'm not.

37:47.561 --> 37:49.063
I lost you once before.

37:49.183 --> 37:52.678
I spent most of today
thinking I lost you again.

37:58.454 --> 38:01.969
What would you have
done... if you were me?

38:03.238 --> 38:05.323
Exactly the same thing.

38:11.910 --> 38:14.780
Coast Guard didn't find a body.
Said the current must have taken him.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.759
Her story feels off.

38:16.879 --> 38:20.774
You still don't think she's
connected to Carter's disappearance?

38:23.672 --> 38:25.173
No, I don't.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.942
I mean, who the hell goes back to
work the day they have surgery?

38:36.684 --> 38:38.884
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

38:39.870 --> 38:41.369
What'd you want me to do?

38:41.489 --> 38:43.536
Stay at home, watch soap operas?

38:43.656 --> 38:44.902
Yes.

38:45.121 --> 38:46.904
That's what normal people do.

38:48.097 --> 38:49.608
(grunts softly)

38:49.881 --> 38:51.814
Yeah, comin'.

38:53.389 --> 38:54.664
Hey, bud.

38:54.784 --> 38:57.872
- It's been a long day.
- I'm not here to talk to you.

38:58.358 --> 39:00.707
(chuckling) Right.

39:01.853 --> 39:03.255
Come in.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.739
I'm going to bed.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.632
Mmm.

39:15.124 --> 39:17.764
(sighs) It was a crazy day, huh?

39:22.876 --> 39:24.455
Um...

39:25.502 --> 39:28.233
Sarah, I've been thinking a lot...

39:28.652 --> 39:30.872
about what you said to me earlier,

39:31.387 --> 39:33.772
and it made me realize...

39:37.323 --> 39:39.414
I don't feel the same way.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.377
- What?
- I can't do this anymore.

39:45.869 --> 39:47.021
If this is because of Kurt,

39:47.141 --> 39:48.041
- I mean, he...
- No.

39:48.161 --> 39:49.698
- Like, he doesn't...
- It's not about Kurt.

39:49.818 --> 39:52.146
You don't know me, and...

39:55.242 --> 39:56.772
I've got issues.

39:56.892 --> 39:58.620
I don't believe you.

39:59.722 --> 40:01.379
I know you.

40:02.319 --> 40:06.040
- And I know that you love me, too.
- No, I don't.

40:07.848 --> 40:09.570
I'm sorry, Sarah.

40:15.879 --> 40:17.418
(door shuts)

40:22.946 --> 40:26.042
The water's actually not
that bad once you're in.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.868
Wow you almost seemed happy
to see me for a second.

40:35.003 --> 40:36.423
What happened?

40:36.543 --> 40:39.106
You're not the only one
who can hold their breath.

40:40.238 --> 40:44.341
Cade's grudge seemed like a lot more
than just a difference of ideals.

40:44.461 --> 40:46.077
It felt personal.

40:46.815 --> 40:51.128
He wanted you to watch me die
because of what you did to Marcos?

40:52.022 --> 40:53.415
What did you do to him?

40:53.535 --> 40:54.699
We all made sacrifices.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.219
No. That's not good enough, not today.

40:59.497 --> 41:01.837
Cade lost someone close to him once,

41:01.957 --> 41:03.567
and he held me responsible.

41:04.250 --> 41:05.533
Were you?

41:07.039 --> 41:08.186
Yeah.

41:09.406 --> 41:13.140
You always act like everything is
going completely according to plan,

41:13.349 --> 41:15.849
but today, Cade proved that wasn't true.

41:18.784 --> 41:20.769
What else aren't you telling me?

41:21.470 --> 41:24.192
- How worried should I be?
- Cade's dead. We beat him.

41:24.312 --> 41:26.087
Things are back on track.

41:26.783 --> 41:29.559
- So what now?
- Now you go home.

41:30.930 --> 41:32.627
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:32.887 --> 41:34.544
Yeah.

41:39.801 --> 41:42.069
(distant thunder)

41:47.686 --> 41:49.343
(tires screeching)
