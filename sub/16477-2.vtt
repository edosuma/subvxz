WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.637
*

00:10.544 --> 00:14.182
Oh! Everybody I never
wanted to see again,

00:14.215 --> 00:16.084
all in one room.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.618
So, tell me why
we're here again?

00:17.651 --> 00:18.719
Um...

00:18.752 --> 00:20.188
(stutters)

00:20.221 --> 00:21.389
Uh...
(clears throat)

00:21.422 --> 00:23.791
Right.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.126
'Cause the dream
never dies.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.194
Well, uh...

00:26.227 --> 00:27.328
uh, nerds are supposed

00:27.361 --> 00:28.496
to be cool now, right?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.830
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe, you know.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.300
(indistinct conversation)

00:32.333 --> 00:34.402
(exhales)
Let's see if
we're grandfathered in.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.437
(sighs)
Yeah.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.143
Oops. Sorry.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.577
Come on, man,

00:43.611 --> 00:45.213
aren't we a little
too old for that now?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.282
Too old for what...

00:48.316 --> 00:50.318
exactly?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.223
Um...

00:55.256 --> 00:57.225
too old to fall
back on an outdated

00:57.258 --> 00:59.327
social hierarchy that
penalizes achievement

00:59.360 --> 01:00.728
and rewards mediocrity.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.829
(chuckles)

01:01.862 --> 01:04.132
Oh.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.167
That sounded
like an insult.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.336
I think.
Um...

01:08.369 --> 01:10.604
Whoa, it's...
No, don't.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.140
Don't.
...my life coach, so...

01:12.173 --> 01:14.275
Okay. Ooh.
Come on.

01:14.308 --> 01:15.176
Wow.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.478
(groans)

01:17.511 --> 01:19.447
Looks like it's
just me and you.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.150
* It's the same
as the emotion... *

01:22.183 --> 01:24.352
Yeah, you know.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.187
That and your teensy,
weensy, little...

01:26.220 --> 01:29.157
(grunting)

01:29.190 --> 01:31.459
* Give me your heart,
make it real or else... *

01:31.492 --> 01:33.461
Hey, so what'd you end up doing
after high school?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.830
I joined Special Forces.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.136
Got my CPA degree
off the GI Bill.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.304
You should check it out.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.239
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.340
Yeah, good luck with that.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.246
Um... you meant today, right?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.183
(groans)

01:55.216 --> 01:56.184
Whoa.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.218
(groaning)

01:57.251 --> 01:58.486
No. Hey.

01:58.519 --> 01:59.320
Hey, hey, hey.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.321
Hey.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.455
Hey...

02:01.489 --> 02:03.457
Hey, hey. Hey.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.159
Oh.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.760
Oh, no, no, no.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.596
Oh.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.764
Somebody call 911!

02:10.798 --> 02:13.501
Call 911!

02:14.335 --> 02:16.770
*

02:44.865 --> 02:47.268
(elevator bell dings)

02:49.303 --> 02:50.238
Oh.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.672
What's Torres doing here?

02:51.705 --> 02:52.840
I don't know.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.408
He and Quinn don't
officially start

02:54.442 --> 02:55.676
till Monday.
Hey, Torres.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.511
Hey, what's up?
Hey, you know, uh...

02:57.545 --> 02:58.612
you know it's
Friday night, right?

02:58.646 --> 02:59.613
TORRES:
Yeah, I know.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.981
Just not really sure how

03:01.014 --> 03:03.551
this whole desk thing works,
so, uh...

03:03.584 --> 03:06.254
figured I'd drop off
a few things early.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.821
Starting with a picture
of yourself.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.856
Yeah.

03:08.889 --> 03:09.857
It's a reminder.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.292
Of...?

03:11.325 --> 03:12.593
Something I like
to be reminded of.

03:12.626 --> 03:13.594
(watch beeping)

03:13.627 --> 03:14.695
Hmm.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.863
Okay, we got to go.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.765
Talk to you Monday.
Oh, you guys are...

03:17.798 --> 03:19.433
late to spinning class
or something?
Uh, no, Gibbs is famous

03:19.467 --> 03:20.868
for coming in
just before the weekend

03:20.901 --> 03:21.869
starts and saying...

03:21.902 --> 03:22.803
Grab your gear.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.808
That a well-timed
illustration, boss?
Got a death at Quantico.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.878
(quietly):
Okay.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.383
GIBBS:
Are you coming?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.018
I'm not much of

03:38.051 --> 03:39.420
a varsity letters guy.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.464
TORRES:
James Bruno.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.300
Graduated Puller High
15 years ago.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.601
Barely, from what I hear.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.369
His father was stationed

03:55.403 --> 03:57.371
at the motor pool on base.
TORRES: So, what do you think?

03:57.405 --> 03:59.607
Involuntary manslaughter?
Yeah. Maybe.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.675
Jethro Gibbs doesn't
like to commit.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.311
That's why it's the
perfect job for him.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.612
Thanks for calling me.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.314
I'm ready to get started.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.981
Get started.
Okay.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.550
All right, what did I miss?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.684
Your jacket.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.356
Okay.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.724
Oh, I don't know,
he looks fine.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.659
Just fine.
Who is he?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.328
Oh, that's Agent Torres.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.062
Oh, that's great.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.397
Who are you?

04:23.431 --> 04:25.466
A-Agent Quinn.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.735
I swear,

04:27.768 --> 04:29.069
I barely touched him.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.538
I mean, I just did
a controlled throw

04:30.571 --> 04:32.806
so that he would think
twice about touching me.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.408
So, what started the fight?

04:34.442 --> 04:35.476
Nothing.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.710
He's just that kind of guy.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.011
He's just always
starting something.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.413
When was the last time
you saw him?

04:39.447 --> 04:40.714
Uh, I haven't seen him

04:40.748 --> 04:42.082
since high school.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.717
15 years.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.856
(groans)

04:48.889 --> 04:49.857
Looks like nothing's changed.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.525
The teenage years

04:51.559 --> 04:52.893
are fraught with peril.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.395
The frontal cortex

04:54.428 --> 04:56.597
is responsible
for self-regulation.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.100
It develops gradually
over adolescence.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.436
Unfortunately, in some adults,

05:02.470 --> 05:04.638
well, it never occurs.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.740
You aren't talking
about anyone

05:06.774 --> 05:09.810
in particular, are you,
Doctor? 'Cause I was only

05:09.843 --> 05:11.645
popping that bubble wrap
to see if it was still...
The victim,

05:11.679 --> 05:12.746
Mr. Palmer.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.482
I was referring to the victim.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.616
GIBBS:
What about him?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.518
Well, I don't see
anything obvious,

05:17.551 --> 05:20.654
but this hypersalivation
suggests there's some

05:20.688 --> 05:22.623
sort of poison at work.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.626
Boss, we got a problem.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.497
What do you got, McGee?

05:29.530 --> 05:30.864
Talked to one
of the eyewitnesses.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.633
They saw Bruno
arrive early,

05:32.666 --> 05:34.568
put something in one
of these lockers

05:34.602 --> 05:35.636
and it wasn't a math book.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.905
Stand clear.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.842
TORRES:
Yeah.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.577
I think this guy had issues.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.390
So, this button
moves forward;

05:56.424 --> 05:57.725
this one moves
backwards,

05:57.758 --> 06:00.160
and this is the "Oops, How
Did That Get There?" button.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.161
The what?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.530
We push it when Gibbs

06:02.563 --> 06:03.664
asks for the impossible

06:03.697 --> 06:05.032
to distract him.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.568
I-It's preloaded with
pictures of his ex-wives

06:07.601 --> 06:10.170
or Jimmy Palmer making
turducken, stuff like that.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.705
(chuckles)
And you think
he doesn't know

06:11.739 --> 06:13.040
what you're doing?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.842
He's good.
He's not that good.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.544
All right, Jim Bruno.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.446
Let's go.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.847
BISHOP:
Jim Bruno, born James.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.715
Left home after high school,
never came back.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.816
Yeah, he got a job

06:22.850 --> 06:24.685
teaching shop
at a community college.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.654
Ended after a
burglary conviction.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.558
Wrong button.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.593
Oops.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.728
BISHOP:
Bruno's never paid taxes,

06:34.762 --> 06:36.029
never voted,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.466
and has no recent
home address we can find.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.567
Yeah, your doc
confirms that

06:39.600 --> 06:40.734
he was poisoned to death.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.169
Are we sure the explosive
was his?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.572
We are now.
A base surveillance camera

06:44.605 --> 06:46.840
shows him assembling
a bomb in his car.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.476
Bomb squad's
sending it to Abby.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.743
Said there's
enough explosives

06:49.777 --> 06:50.444
in there to
level the gym.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.045
Bruno would've ended up killing

06:52.079 --> 06:53.080
his entire high school
graduating class.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.015
McGee and Quinn.
High school
records. On it.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.017
Bishop and Torres,
go talk to his teachers.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.486
See who remembers him.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.854
Uh...
Yeah?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.490
What desk should I be at?
GIBBS:
Right here.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.657
My old desk.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.092
Putting baby
in the corner?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.927
That's where you sat
when you were a probie.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.729
Since when do you sit down?
Oh.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.964
Uh...

07:16.136 --> 07:17.805
There's five of us here now.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.740
Gonna have to...

07:19.773 --> 07:21.742
rearrange some stuff.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.680
You try to do what you can
for these kids,

07:26.714 --> 07:29.182
be sensitive to their needs
but some of them are just,

07:29.216 --> 07:30.818
well, beyond
reach, you know?

07:30.851 --> 07:31.952
Hey! Hey!

07:31.985 --> 07:33.854
Don't just pull
the poster down!

07:33.887 --> 07:36.223
Take the tape off the wall!

07:36.256 --> 07:37.991
Idiots.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.059
(sighs)

07:39.092 --> 07:40.160
Sorry, where were we?

07:40.193 --> 07:41.729
You were just telling us

07:41.762 --> 07:43.564
how sensitive you can be.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.198
Hey, I did what
I could for that kid.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.735
His senior year, I spent
eight weekends in a row

07:47.768 --> 07:50.170
in Saturday detention with him,
trying to whip him into shape.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.805
Nothing took.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.707
Always causing a ruckus.

07:53.741 --> 07:54.875
Recent contact?

07:54.908 --> 07:55.876
No...

07:55.909 --> 07:57.244
but it's a tight community.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.812
I heard a rumor
he was renting a room

07:58.846 --> 08:00.748
from an old substitute teacher.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.782
Do you think he was

08:01.815 --> 08:02.883
targeting anyone
in particular?

08:02.916 --> 08:03.884
Take your pick.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.985
That punk had problems

08:05.018 --> 08:06.520
with everyone in the school.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.755
How many had
problems with him?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.056
What, you're looking
for a list or something?

08:09.089 --> 08:10.758
His death wasn't
accidental.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.892
He was poisoned.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.294
(sighs)

08:14.327 --> 08:16.764
Well, then you got your work
cut out for you.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.099
Everyone had problems
with that kid.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.771
(elevator bell dings)

08:23.804 --> 08:24.572
Abbs,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.006
McGee said you had
something for me.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.775
Yup. Yup, I do.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.776
Yeah.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.677
Behind your back.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.612
No... no, this is some...

08:31.645 --> 08:33.280
it's nothing.
It's just...

08:33.313 --> 08:35.315
Well, it's my...
it's my high school yearbook.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.784
I thought I would,
you know,

08:36.817 --> 08:38.752
get in the mood for the case.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.187
It's a very bad move.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.655
I don't want to talk about it.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.256
Works for me.
It's just that...

08:43.290 --> 08:45.759
high school, you know?

08:45.793 --> 08:49.129
It's where I found my...
I don't know, style?

08:49.162 --> 08:54.034
And realized my obsession
with blood-spatter patterns.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.268
Speaking of which...

08:55.302 --> 08:57.905
It just wasn't a great combo

08:57.938 --> 09:00.741
for making friends and
influencing people.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.044
I had a lot of, um, alone time

09:04.077 --> 09:06.046
in high school, but...

09:06.079 --> 09:07.180
let's just leave it at that

09:07.214 --> 09:08.348
'cause I said I didn't want

09:08.381 --> 09:09.349
to talk about it, remember?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.719
Yes.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.920
Okay.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.187
Good.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.189
On to happier subjects.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.759
This is the
explosive device

09:18.792 --> 09:19.960
that Bruno was going to use

09:19.993 --> 09:21.762
to commit mass murder.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.130
It has a wireless receiver

09:23.163 --> 09:25.766
and it was built from a toy
remote-control car kit.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.100
Can you trace it?
Hopefully

09:27.134 --> 09:29.603
or eventually.
Don't be so impatient.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.605
How close did Bruno need to get
to trigger the explosive?

09:31.639 --> 09:33.807
Well, it's a long-range
transmitter, so he wasn't,

09:33.841 --> 09:35.809
like, suicidal,
if that's what you're thinking.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.912
As a matter of fact,
he was trying to quit smoking

09:38.946 --> 09:40.781
and that is what
actually killed him.

09:40.814 --> 09:41.982
The killer spiked

09:42.015 --> 09:45.052
his nicotine patch
with a cyanide analogue

09:45.085 --> 09:46.654
about 20 minutes
before he put it on,

09:46.687 --> 09:48.155
according to the
adhesive oxidation.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.058
That rules out everyone
at the reunion.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.926
I know.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.862
Ducky said that Bruno
was already wearing the patch

09:54.895 --> 09:56.764
when he got there.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.831
That's good news.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.132
'Cause it narrows down

09:59.166 --> 10:00.768
our suspect list.

10:00.801 --> 10:01.802
Yeah.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.837
To zero.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.176
If I never see a retired
substitute teacher again,

10:09.209 --> 10:10.844
it'll be too soon.

10:10.878 --> 10:11.779
How many are left?

10:11.812 --> 10:14.347
Well, five down,
six to go.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.716
Quinn's got another five.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.284
(clangs)

10:19.186 --> 10:20.888
Ma'am, hello.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.955
NCIS.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.123
I'm, uh, Special Agent

10:23.156 --> 10:24.825
Timothy McGee and this is

10:24.858 --> 10:25.926
Special Agent
Bishop here.

10:25.959 --> 10:26.927
Hi, there.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.995
Uh, are you currently

10:28.028 --> 10:29.129
renting a room

10:29.162 --> 10:30.363
to this man?

10:30.397 --> 10:33.266
(chuckles)
Aren't you two cute.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.434
I'll take two boxes

10:34.467 --> 10:35.903
of Skinny Mints

10:35.936 --> 10:38.839
and two boxes
of Peanut Butteries.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.040
MISS FRIMKES:
My apologies.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.709
I don't see so well
these days.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.677
I could've sworn you said
you were selling cookies.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.813
(chuckles)
Wishful thinking, I guess.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.114
I do love Skinny Mints.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.882
Mmm, I do, too.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.852
So how long has
Bruno been living here?

10:51.885 --> 10:54.454
Several years now,
poor thing.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.289
Would you like
some coffee?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.991
Uh, no, thanks, I'm okay, ma'am.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.727
Heard on the
radio what happened.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.861
Don't buy a word of it.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.262
BISHOP:
Really? Why not?

11:02.295 --> 11:05.032
James Bruno was such a nice boy.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.467
Always paid his rent on time.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.469
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.138
Cream?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.974
Uh, no, ma'am, I actually
said I didn't want coffee.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.976
Cream it is.
McGEE:
Uh...

11:16.009 --> 11:17.945
did you know that
he had a criminal record?

11:17.978 --> 11:20.280
I'm blind, honey, not an idiot.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.917
I did my background check
before I rented the room.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.086
Which is back this way,
if you want to see it.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.059
(door creaks open)

11:32.092 --> 11:35.328
I didn't learn anything
I didn't know already, though.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.798
I remember that boy
from high school.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.066
We heard
he was trouble back then.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.233
Oh, he was.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.769
Everyone hated him.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.104
But then he changed senior year.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.773
Out of the blue,
he started dating

11:45.806 --> 11:47.841
one of the most popular girls
in class.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.342
It was the darndest thing.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.278
She turned that boy's
whole life around.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.813
And his attitude.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.481
He ended up being
quite well-liked.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.916
Here you go.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.051
You got a key?
No.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.419
I don't go in there.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.921
He likes his privacy.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.790
Boys and their boy antics.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.392
(Bishop and Miss Frimkes
chuckle)

12:05.425 --> 12:07.227
What a tragic ending.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.897
But I don't believe for
a second he's capable of murder.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.499
I can't imagine why anyone
he went to school with

12:12.532 --> 12:14.001
would want to kill him.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.169
Or why anyone would at all,
for that matter.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.204
Know what I mean?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.438
All right.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.508
He was a good kid.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.076
BISHOP:
Not that good.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.379
McGEE: Look at this, iPads,
jewelry, paintings.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.116
MISS FRIMKES:
Oh, where he get all that stuff?
McGEE: Good question.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.393
ABBY (through bullhorn):
Okay, people,

12:40.427 --> 12:42.796
we have fine art on table A.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.464
Electronics on table B.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.167
Jewelry and
household goods, tables C...

12:47.200 --> 12:48.936
There's a lot of stuff here,
how much do you think this is
all worth?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.904
All these wonderful prizes

12:50.938 --> 12:52.339
are worth
tens of thousands of dollars

12:52.372 --> 12:54.007
and they can all be yours,

12:54.041 --> 12:56.276
Timothy McGee,
if you can answer
(elevator bell dings)

12:56.309 --> 13:00.213
the NCIS bonus question.
Where'd it come from?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.949
(airhorn sound)
Actually, boss,
I can answer that.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.016
Burglaries.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.017
All over the city.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.385
Torres dug up this report.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.954
Metro PD's been tracking

13:06.987 --> 13:09.957
a citywide theft ring
for over half a decade.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.458
GIBBS:
This is all they got?
Yup.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.193
Clearly Bruno didn't
do all this himself,

13:13.226 --> 13:15.062
but Metro never
generated a single lead

13:15.095 --> 13:16.563
on whoever was involved.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.199
ABBY: Well, I have one.
Not to brag.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.001
All the fingerprints
that I found

13:21.034 --> 13:23.003
in the room belonged to Bruno.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.237
But I also found this,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.006
which did not,
according to Ducky.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.108
Bruno had a visitor
with a really bad case

13:28.141 --> 13:30.577
of pityriasis capitis.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.113
AKA dandruff.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.214
Left flakes everywhere.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.550
Like snow.
That teacher see anyone?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.987
I don't think she's seen anyone
since the '90s, boss.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.255
She did say Bruno would
have an occasional visitor.

13:42.289 --> 13:46.093
Said it was, "A man
or maybe a woman, I think."

13:46.126 --> 13:47.160
Whoever they are,

13:47.194 --> 13:48.996
I'll bet you dollars to donuts

13:49.029 --> 13:51.298
that they are gonna be coming
back for this stuff.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.967
Take Quinn, McGee,
eyes on that house 24/7.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.037
Abbs?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.138
Don't even think about it.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.909
(airhorn sounds,
elevator bell dings)

14:04.177 --> 14:06.646
McGEE: So how long has it been
since you've been on stakeout?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.648
QUINN:
It's been a while.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.118
But I-I'm good to go.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.186
I taught yearly seminars on it.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.055
Oh, I... I remember.
Oh, that's right.

14:17.324 --> 14:21.328
I did forgot
one crucial element.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.297
What's that?
Hydration is your enemy.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.033
Ah, yeah.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.334
Well...

14:27.367 --> 14:28.635
Men's room.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.171
Ladies' room.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.439
No.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.174
I am not at DEFCON 1 yet.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.442
But you will
be the first to know.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.110
You will be the one with
the bag on your head.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.980
(door creaks open
in the distance)

14:40.013 --> 14:41.348
McGEE:
What is she doing?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.316
We told her to stay
in the house.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.219
Well, we told her to do what
she normally does, so...

14:46.253 --> 14:47.955
Does she normally water
the bird feeder?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.057
QUINN:
Aw, be nice.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.925
She's a lonely old lady.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.061
(gasps)
Which reminds me,

14:54.094 --> 14:56.997
Bishop told me you're going
to propose to your girlfriend.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.466
Congrats.
Thanks.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.135
Tho... uh, those two things
reminded you of each other?
Oh.

15:02.169 --> 15:02.970
When are you gonna
pop the question?

15:04.972 --> 15:07.274
When it's time.
And when is that time?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.243
I don't know.
(nervous chuckle)

15:10.277 --> 15:11.378
I'm not exactly sure yet.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.247
I know I'm just
gonna feel it out and...

15:14.281 --> 15:16.950
you know, I... I think...
I'll just know, you know?

15:16.984 --> 15:19.152
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. No.
I'll know that it's
time when it's time.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.387
When might that be?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.421
(chuckles)
I...

15:21.454 --> 15:22.589
Ooh, I see something.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.133
Yeah, it was
really good chatting.
Oh, yeah.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.968
(chuckles)

15:35.002 --> 15:36.669
(car door closes)
Ooh, I got to go.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.305
McGEE:
She won't tell us who she is.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.173
TORRES: Yeah, still
no hits on her prints.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.175
Abby confirmed that
it's her dandruff

15:42.209 --> 15:44.411
in our dead guy's room.
Any I.D.?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.746
Only thing she had
on her was her purse.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.016
TORRES: Yeah, and I have been to
drug-lord torture rooms

15:49.049 --> 15:50.050
less scary.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.525
Me?

15:58.558 --> 15:59.526
(door opens)

16:17.210 --> 16:19.346
Oh.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.613
Yup.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.622
What's your name?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.724
Okay.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.360
Where do you live?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.264
(quietly):
Okay.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.367
What were you doing
in Jimmy Bruno's house?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.572
All right, we can sit here
all day doing this...

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
Hey.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.208
Are you hungry?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.644
Yeah?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.082
Here you go.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.362
(door opens)

17:11.431 --> 17:13.200
Hey.
How's the interrogation going?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.467
Well, just as you thought.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.469
Gibbs is slow walking it.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.706
Seeing if Torres
will pick up the pace.
Hmm, how's he doing?

17:19.739 --> 17:21.541
Well, he interrupted Gibbs.
Took me four years

17:21.574 --> 17:24.677
before I got up
the nerve to do that.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.813
(through speaker):
Thank you.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.216
But he's got her talking.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.718
TORRES:
Don't thank me too fast.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.620
We're about to charge you
with murder.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.663
Bruno was my friend,
I would never hurt him.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.732
Okay, well, then help us
find out who did.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.369
I don't know anything.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.638
Did you know your friend
tried to murder 50 people?

17:54.774 --> 17:57.144
GIBBS: And maybe you were
planning it with him.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.378
No!

17:59.812 --> 18:01.348
Hey!

18:01.381 --> 18:02.515
TORRES:
Then why were you running?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.684
(grunts softly)

18:04.717 --> 18:06.586
I wasn't.
Really?

18:06.619 --> 18:08.855
Sardines, underwear?
Looks like you were
planning a trip somewhere.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.358
Or, you know what? I don't
even want to imagine what else.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.659
Let's just go with running.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.128
You're wrong.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.596
That bomb couldn't
have been Bruno's.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.365
He wouldn't do
something like that.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.468
His fingerprints
were all over it.
Then you made a mistake!

18:21.501 --> 18:24.171
He's a thief, but not a killer.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.540
So you do know something.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.246
You're a thief, too, huh?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.284
Well, somebody's going
down for Bruno's murder

18:37.317 --> 18:40.853
and guess who the Wheel of
Misfortune just stopped on?

18:45.692 --> 18:49.296
I helped Bruno sell
some stuff, that's all.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.231
It's none of my business
where he got it.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.732
How long you been
fencing for him?

18:55.502 --> 18:58.305
We have video of your friend
building that bomb.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
He's not who you think he is.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.776
(scoffs) No, he's not
who y think he is.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.481
You... you see him as
you want to see him.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.916
He's got a lot of bark, yeah,

19:09.949 --> 19:11.384
but no bite.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.386
If he really did
plant that bomb,

19:13.420 --> 19:15.588
then someone made him do it.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.258
He was tricked or something.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.260
And while you're wasting
time in here with me,

19:20.293 --> 19:21.494
whoever manipulated him

19:21.528 --> 19:23.363
could be out there trying again.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.499
Did you ever think about that?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.669
DUCKY:
In some ways, Bruno,

19:29.702 --> 19:31.504
I envy you.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.640
When I was a child, I often

19:33.673 --> 19:36.943
fancied living the life
of a daring cat burglar.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.911
Fortunately for me, yeah,

19:38.945 --> 19:42.515
at age of nine,
on my maiden voyage,

19:42.549 --> 19:45.818
I fell off our
neighbor's roof, yeah.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.587
Landed on my coccyx.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.789
And that was
the end of that.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.524
You're lucky it
ended so quickly.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.792
One time when I was
in high school,

19:52.825 --> 19:55.395
I spent a night in jail
for...

19:55.428 --> 19:57.330
Uh, for...

19:57.364 --> 19:58.765
(stammers)

19:58.798 --> 20:00.400
Never mind.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.469
For what exactly, Mr. Palmer?

20:02.502 --> 20:04.937
Just-- it's funny,
I-I said the word "jail."

20:04.971 --> 20:06.373
I meant to say, um...

20:06.406 --> 20:07.707
Vail.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.477
Yeah, I was-I was a
big skier in high school.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.011
Were you now?
Oh, yeah.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.813
Yeah, I loved the-I loved
the, uh, snow.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.483
(elevator bell dings)
I loved-I loved, uh, skiing
and-and...

20:16.516 --> 20:19.519
What I'd do is I'd-- Vail!

20:19.552 --> 20:22.522
You look like a man
on a mission.
Got an alibi for the murder.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.691
She was nowhere near Bruno
when he was poisoned.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.659
Oh, and so it goes.
Got us to thinking,

20:26.693 --> 20:28.428
maybe there's a second bomber.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.797
We could use a lead.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.533
Well, let's see
what we can come up with.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.035
This man has told me quite
a bit about himself.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.404
Starting with these burns.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.805
They're quite old,

20:38.838 --> 20:41.441
probably inflicted
when he was a teenager.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.377
Military records indicate that
his father died of lung cancer,

20:44.411 --> 20:46.446
excessive cigar smoking.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.048
Yeah, so we can put
two and two together.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.983
He had a rough childhood.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.885
And also a rough week.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.754
Well, yeah. He's dead.
Yes,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.556
but days before that,

20:56.589 --> 21:00.960
he was in a fight where
he suffered severe body blows.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.830
If you look carefully,
you can make out the imprint

21:03.863 --> 21:05.365
of a fist.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.766
Well, his knuckles
don't look too bad.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.602
Yes, well, oddly enough,
he didn't seem to fight back.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.339
Even more odd was
the fact that we removed

21:12.372 --> 21:13.740
a diamond earring

21:13.773 --> 21:14.974
from this lobe.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.376
Well, men are

21:16.409 --> 21:18.010
piercing their ears now, Duck.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.580
Yes, but I'm referring
to the fact that the hole

21:20.613 --> 21:22.482
was closed up from disuse.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.084
Yet he forced the earring
in anyway.
Ugh...

21:25.117 --> 21:26.218
That must've hurt like a mother.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.456
I'm sure it has some...
psychological significance,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.358
but I'm not sure what. However,

21:31.391 --> 21:33.693
Abby came up with
a second set of DNA

21:33.726 --> 21:36.028
on the earring. So,
I imagine you'll find out

21:36.062 --> 21:37.430
soon enough.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.568
Well, is that a good
enough lead for you?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.405
(elevator bell dings)

21:45.438 --> 21:48.541
Hey, so, you're the world-famous
Abby Sciuto I keep

21:48.575 --> 21:49.742
hearing so much about.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.911
Oh, well, guess we can skip the

21:51.944 --> 21:53.613
"I thought you'd
be taller" part.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.915
I'm Agent Quinn.
For what's it worth,

21:55.948 --> 21:59.852
I thought you would be exactly
five feet, six inches.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.654
I made a 3D avatar

22:01.688 --> 22:04.056
of you, using NCIS

22:04.090 --> 22:05.492
security camera footage.

22:08.728 --> 22:12.565
And the hairs slowly went up
on Agent Quinn's neck.
Oh, no, no!

22:12.599 --> 22:14.801
I just... I needed to know
your sizes, because...

22:14.834 --> 22:18.037
I'm knitting you a
"Welcome to NCIS" sweater.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.607
Oh!
(chuckles)
But until it's done,

22:20.640 --> 22:21.608
welcome...

22:21.641 --> 22:22.809
to NCIS.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.877
Well, thank you very much.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.079
Do you want a tour?
I do, uh, but later,

22:27.113 --> 22:29.148
'cause Gibbs wanted me to...
He wants to find out

22:29.181 --> 22:30.517
where the earring came from.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.618
Of course he
does. Well,

22:31.651 --> 22:33.420
right now, all I can
tell you is that

22:33.453 --> 22:35.688
the prior owner was a female.
Okay, so do you know

22:35.722 --> 22:37.757
how long Bruno
had it in his ear?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.126
I have been waiting

22:40.159 --> 22:41.761
for someone to ask me that.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.831
The impurities in the gold

22:44.864 --> 22:46.599
caused our victim's skin oil

22:46.633 --> 22:48.568
to oxidize.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.570
And by measuring that
amount, I could determine

22:50.603 --> 22:53.706
that he forced the stud
through his ear, like,

22:53.740 --> 22:56.042
right before he went
into the reunion.
To kill

22:56.075 --> 22:58.177
50 people.
Then was poisoned to death.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.546
Okay, so whoever owns

22:59.579 --> 23:01.981
the stud, maybe
she knows something.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.584
Well, I'm running the DNA
through CODIS right now.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.420
But I've also
been looking at this,

23:07.454 --> 23:08.821
trying to find
pictures of women.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.557
I found this in a trench coat

23:10.590 --> 23:12.725
in Bruno's closet.
Unfortunately...

23:12.759 --> 23:14.527
no women yet.
Huh.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.028
Are these the homes
that he robbed?
Yeah.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.931
Looks like he was casing
them for a few days.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.001
There's also a few
pictures of his feet...

23:22.034 --> 23:23.736
and some pictures of

23:23.770 --> 23:25.605
some other people
that I haven't identified yet.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.007
Ho-Hold up.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.141
Go back one.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.111
That's Neal Sherwood.
You know him?

23:32.144 --> 23:34.514
Well, he was at the reunion, and
he had a fight with the victim

23:34.547 --> 23:35.982
right before he died.
Well, that's important.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.551
Uh, yeah, because Neal said

23:38.585 --> 23:40.186
they hadn't seen
each other in 15 years.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.656
Oh.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.526
*

23:53.666 --> 23:55.702
(phone rings)

23:55.735 --> 23:57.470
Where is he?

23:57.504 --> 23:59.038
McGEE: With his suitcase,
wherever that is.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.708
Neighbors said he split
right after the reunion.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.709
McGEE:
Left in a hurry.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.076
He's running.
Quinn, BOLO.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.579
McGee, freeway cams
and credit cards. Find him.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.948
BISHOP: We found something.
Abby got a hit on the DNA

24:08.981 --> 24:11.083
from the earring Bruno
was wearing.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.520
(beeping)

24:13.553 --> 24:14.921
TORRES:
Katrina Cooper.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.589
A high school
classmate of Bruno's.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.859
Former prom queen, married the
school jock, active social life.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.794
How did Bruno get her earring?
Could've stolen it,

24:21.828 --> 24:23.863
but if he did,
she never reported it.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.197
They have any recent contact?
No.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.800
No calls, no texts,
no Snapchat doggie faces.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.936
The only connection we could
find was from high school.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.606
They had a Saturday
detention together, once.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.874
15 years ago?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.075
Thin, I know.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.544
Talk to her.

24:37.577 --> 24:40.713
Find out why her DNA
was in our dead guy's ear.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.652
Round two, everybody!

24:45.685 --> 24:48.955
We got soccer meatballs,
lacrosse stick hot dogs...

24:48.988 --> 24:50.957
and pigskin pizza pockets.

24:50.990 --> 24:51.991
Who's hungry?

24:52.024 --> 24:53.893
BISHOP:
Mmm. I am.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.663
Hi. You must be here
for Katrina.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.797
Why would you say that?
That's what

24:57.830 --> 25:00.533
happens when you marry
the most popular girl in town.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.034
Everybody's here for Katrina.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.971
Hmm.
She's over there,
in the huddle.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.573
(laughter)

25:11.010 --> 25:12.879
(chuckles)

25:12.912 --> 25:14.881
They're like...
little footballs.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.048
KATRINA:
And I told the guy,

25:16.082 --> 25:18.050
"Give me Louis Vuitton,

25:18.084 --> 25:20.252
or give me death."
(laughter)

25:20.286 --> 25:22.154
(laughs)
I got this.
Okay.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.723
Um, Katrina Cooper?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.224
How you guys doing?

25:25.257 --> 25:26.793
You guys have fun?

25:27.927 --> 25:29.929
NCIS Special Agent Torres,

25:29.962 --> 25:31.631
Bishop.
Hi.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.666
Can we have a word with you?

25:33.700 --> 25:36.335
Of course.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.204
Let's not disturb the party,
shall we?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.772
Excuse me.

25:39.806 --> 25:40.907
Let's not do that.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.675
They're little footballs.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.943
They're good.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.012
KATRINA:
And how can I help you?

25:46.045 --> 25:47.914
(beeps)
Do you know this guy?

25:47.947 --> 25:50.750
Mm, no.
Am I supposed to?

25:50.783 --> 25:52.785
Well, you guys went
to high school together.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.120
Oh, in fact,

25:54.153 --> 25:55.688
he actually died
in front of you.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.690
At your high school
reunion, two days ago?

25:57.724 --> 26:00.660
Interestingly enough,
wearing one of your earrings.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.861
It was stolen.
Oh.

26:01.894 --> 26:02.995
You didn't report it stolen.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.296
I am now.
You know,

26:04.330 --> 26:05.732
I bet you and me
had something

26:05.765 --> 26:06.766
in common in high school.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.735
(chuckles):
I don't think so.

26:08.768 --> 26:09.501
We both liked bad boys.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.103
The badder the
better, except,

26:11.137 --> 26:12.705
I grew out of it.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.340
I don't think you did.
Your husband know

26:14.373 --> 26:15.675
that you and Bruno

26:15.708 --> 26:17.677
have been sleeping together?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.211
Excuse me?
What I'm wondering...

26:19.245 --> 26:21.781
is if you knew how bad
Bruno really was.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.816
TORRES: You know,
if he told you about,

26:23.850 --> 26:26.018
for the last several years, he's
been robbing people in the city.

26:26.052 --> 26:29.756
Yeah, I think it's time
for you to go. Cheers.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.691
Have one more question...
No.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.959
No, no, no more questions.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.827
I don't know anything
about any robberies,

26:34.861 --> 26:36.763
I'm not cheating on my husband
and I have no idea

26:36.796 --> 26:38.330
where Neal Sherwood is. Okay?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.400
Well, that was actually
my next question,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.269
which... I haven't asked yet.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.872
(chuckles)
Oh, right.
Hmm.

26:45.905 --> 26:46.973
Where is he?

26:47.006 --> 26:48.775
(gunshot)
(screaming)

26:48.808 --> 26:49.909
Get down!

26:51.143 --> 26:53.713
*

26:58.250 --> 26:59.786
(exhales)

26:59.819 --> 27:01.320
Found him.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.334
NEAL (over speaker):
The cops are outside right now.

27:15.367 --> 27:16.869
It's over.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.805
To be honest,
it's kind of a relief.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.339
(grunts, sniffles)

27:21.808 --> 27:23.776
I am willing
to set the record straight,

27:23.810 --> 27:25.945
but I cannot go to prison.
I just can't.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.749
(laughs)
I can't have it, my family...

27:29.782 --> 27:31.350
can't have it.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.853
So...

27:33.886 --> 27:35.154
I'm sorry.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.126
(beeps)

27:41.360 --> 27:43.996
Shot himself with a flare gun.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.898
That's a new one.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.801
Did I miss the part where
he set the record straight?

27:48.835 --> 27:51.203
Maybe it's on the laptop?

27:51.237 --> 27:53.205
Go-Go Abby fingers.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.847
Hey, so, um...

28:00.880 --> 28:01.948
(clears throat)

28:01.981 --> 28:03.282
You, um...

28:03.315 --> 28:06.018
liked bad boys in school, huh?

28:06.052 --> 28:07.086
(chuckles)

28:07.119 --> 28:08.755
I'm sorry,
I just... I just

28:08.788 --> 28:11.891
painted for you for more
of a goody two-shoes, uh,

28:11.924 --> 28:13.192
prom queen type.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.226
Actually, I...

28:14.260 --> 28:16.395
was the prom queen.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.898
Wow. So you played us both.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.199
Nice.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.968
Except, I was voted in
as a joke.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.871
Kind of like Carrie, but...
without the blood.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.206
Bishop, that's like...
the worst thing I've ever heard.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.374
Yeah, I didn't

28:28.407 --> 28:30.076
have any friends in high school,

28:30.109 --> 28:32.979
I was too... me, I guess.
(beeping)

28:33.012 --> 28:34.213
I got something.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.948
Okay, it's a text document.
Neal made it

28:35.982 --> 28:37.750
right before he shot himself.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.886
Looks like some kind
of confession.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.187
It's even double-spaced
and everything.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.723
TORRES: What exactly
is he confessing to?

28:46.926 --> 28:48.828
McGEE:
According to Neal,

28:48.861 --> 28:50.162
he and his high school friends

28:50.196 --> 28:52.231
are the ones behind
Metro's theft ring.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.800
With each friend playing

28:53.833 --> 28:56.402
a very specific role.
Adam Cooper,

28:56.435 --> 28:59.872
former jock, ended up running
a sports betting company.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.841
That's where he would
identify the wealthy marks.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.410
BISHOP: Katrina Cooper,
his prom queen wife,

29:04.443 --> 29:06.478
would flirt her way into
the homes to get info

29:06.512 --> 29:07.880
on their security systems.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.481
Bad boy would do

29:09.515 --> 29:11.784
the actual robberies,
and this woman,

29:11.818 --> 29:13.519
who we've now identified
as former classmate,

29:13.552 --> 29:15.221
Angela Russell,

29:15.254 --> 29:17.957
would fence the stolen goods
on the street where she lived.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.259
Finally, there's Neal Sherwood,
the accountant.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.162
And he laundered the money.
Yep. According
to Neal,

29:23.195 --> 29:24.563
they came up with the idea

29:24.596 --> 29:26.565
to start a robbery gang
back in school,

29:26.598 --> 29:29.035
after they met at
a Saturday detention.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.203
BISHOP: He said they talked
about it as a joke at first,

29:31.237 --> 29:33.873
as a way to "get back"
at their parents.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.074
Eventually they realized,

29:35.107 --> 29:36.442
if they pooled their talents,

29:36.475 --> 29:38.177
they could make some real money.
JIMMY: All of this

29:38.210 --> 29:40.512
seems very familiar.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.048
JIMMY:
Yeah...

29:42.081 --> 29:44.917
Yeah, I'm v-very interested
in this case, here.

29:44.951 --> 29:48.354
We got five different
high school kids from varied

29:48.387 --> 29:51.824
social backgrounds all coming
together on their Saturdays,

29:51.858 --> 29:53.926
for detention.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.527
(laughs)

29:55.561 --> 29:57.596
You know,
it kind of reminds me of, uh...

29:57.629 --> 29:58.865
You've...

29:58.898 --> 30:00.799
You don't...

30:02.568 --> 30:04.570
Not important.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.108
Sorry.
(clears throat)

30:11.510 --> 30:14.213
Anyway, the different social
groups was part of the reason

30:14.246 --> 30:17.016
Metro was never able to crack
the burglary ring.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.151
They were never able to find a
connection between the players.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.920
Congratulations, we just
solved Metro's case.

30:20.953 --> 30:21.954
What about our own?

30:21.988 --> 30:23.455
We have no clue

30:23.489 --> 30:25.091
who killed our victim!

30:25.124 --> 30:26.225
Actually, not true.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.960
The prom queen ain't talking,

30:27.994 --> 30:29.261
but the fence is.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.930
She thinks she knows
who killed Bruno.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.035
Two days ago,

30:36.068 --> 30:38.570
your wife gave
Bruno that earring.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.239
I don't believe you.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.908
Welcome to the club.
You were

30:41.941 --> 30:44.243
the only one not at the reunion.
You were the only one

30:44.276 --> 30:46.512
that had the opportunity
to poison Bruno.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.080
Prosecutor's gonna
file charges today,

30:48.114 --> 30:49.648
unless you have something
to tell us.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.985
This isn't where I imagined
I'd be after high school.

30:53.019 --> 30:55.955
Ah. Welcome to the club.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.924
I wanted to be
a pro football player.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.126
You?

31:04.430 --> 31:05.664
Painter.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.199
Really.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.267
Really?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.269
Yeah. Really. Painter.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.909
Loved to paint.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.547
Watercolors, mostly.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.183
I took every art class
that school had.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.584
Water colors?

31:25.617 --> 31:27.219
It's hard to imagine
a grown man...

31:28.454 --> 31:30.189
So what happened?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.124
Life.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.994
Life. I paint with wood.
It's close enough.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.630
Not for me.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.033
I suspected Katrina and
Bruno had started up again,

31:41.067 --> 31:44.003
but I didn't want to believe it.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.172
But if she really
gave him her earring...

31:47.539 --> 31:49.108
...it's game over for us.

31:49.141 --> 31:52.011
It's worse than that.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.645
I think that witch
tried to kill me.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.214
The last house
we knocked over,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.616
Bruno snagged a painting
worth over a million bucks.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.986
My wife kept joking we should
take out our partners,

32:00.019 --> 32:02.154
keep the money for ourselves.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.689
Said we should bomb the reunion,

32:03.722 --> 32:05.992
and make it look like
a terrorist attack.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.460
I honestly thought
she was joking.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.296
She must've talked
Bruno into it.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.164
He was always a sucker for her.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.233
No way he would come up with
something like that on his own.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.002
Hell, he was even gonna
pretend to let Neal

32:16.035 --> 32:18.170
kick the crap out of him
at the reunion as a goof,

32:18.204 --> 32:19.238
to impress some girls.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.141
Bruno was bad
on the outside,

32:22.174 --> 32:24.176
but good on the inside.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.212
My wife?

32:26.245 --> 32:28.314
The opposite.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.715
What about you?
All I can say

32:29.748 --> 32:31.083
is I'm not a murderer.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.684
I didn't kill Bruno,
and I wasn't

32:32.718 --> 32:34.353
anywhere near him
when he was poisoned.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.622
(elevator bell dings)

32:38.057 --> 32:40.126
Hypothetically speaking,

32:40.159 --> 32:42.394
how would you feel
about a betting pool

32:42.428 --> 32:44.563
on whether his alibi
checks out?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.265
Hypothetically?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.666
How'd Ducky bet?

32:47.699 --> 32:49.468
Guilty.
How'd you bet?

32:49.501 --> 32:51.103
I'm not a gambling man.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.138
(laughs)

32:52.171 --> 32:53.372
And I have no idea.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.177
TORRES: I mean,
who are these people?

32:58.210 --> 33:00.679
Living double lives like this?

33:00.712 --> 33:03.649
I mean, yeah, I mean, I...
I lived as someone else,

33:03.682 --> 33:05.317
for the most
of the last decade, but...

33:05.351 --> 33:08.387
I had an excuse, I was, uh...
I was undercover.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.223
Which version
is the real them?

33:11.257 --> 33:12.624
Which version
is the real you?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.260
You're looking at it.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.762
Am I?

33:16.795 --> 33:19.298
You created all
those covers.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.466
It wasn't random.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.168
(laughs)

33:22.201 --> 33:24.703
Wait, you're saying that a part
of me wanted to be a, uh,

33:24.736 --> 33:27.239
mafia-tied,
vegan juice-bar owner?

33:28.640 --> 33:30.176
Eh...

33:30.209 --> 33:31.110
You just couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.611
You tried
to kill us all!

33:32.644 --> 33:35.047
Oh, could everyone
just please stop fighting?

33:35.081 --> 33:37.516
Shove a Pixy Stix
up your nose!

33:37.549 --> 33:39.551
BISHOP:
McGee is taking them to Metro
not a moment too soon.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.421
And Miss Congeniality
denied having anything

33:42.454 --> 33:43.789
to do with the bomb attempt,

33:43.822 --> 33:45.691
even though we found
the detonator in her car.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.593
Unfortunately, her husband's
alibi came through.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.195
Like he said,

33:49.228 --> 33:51.163
he was nowhere near Bruno
when he was poisoned.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.631
The fight with Neal was staged.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.600
TORRES:
If none of them
killed Bruno, then

33:54.633 --> 33:56.302
who the hell did?

34:05.444 --> 34:08.480
All right, let's go back
to what we do know.

34:08.514 --> 34:09.781
He's dead.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.418
I feel pretty confident
about that.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.186
What else do we know?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.687
We know who didn't kill him.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.823
And a million-dollar
painting is missing.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.791
We find the painting,
we find the killer.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.260
Checked everybody's houses.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.394
Nobody has it.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.762
Everyone insists Bruno has it.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.231
He didn't.
He could've hid it.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.199
Maybe in a storage unit
in the area.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.334
Yeah, safe-deposit box.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.869
Start looking.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.105
TORRES: All that work
and we're back to square one.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.573
Tell me about it.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.242
What about the fight
Ducky said he was in?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.244
Maybe he came back
to finish the job.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.578
Our only witness is dead.

34:39.611 --> 34:40.879
Okay, what would I tell
my students

34:40.912 --> 34:42.814
in my GPS forensics class?

34:42.848 --> 34:45.651
I would have them go back
and reconstruct a timeline

34:45.684 --> 34:47.419
of Bruno's movements.

34:47.453 --> 34:48.720
Maybe we can find
another witness.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.256
Do it.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.690
There goes
my evening plans.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.525
Were they exciting plans?

34:53.559 --> 34:55.627
Uh, cooking class?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.763
Oh, well, don't
cancel that just yet.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.699
You. I have
goodies, come on.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.337
You know...

35:05.371 --> 35:06.772
Even though you
just met her,

35:06.805 --> 35:08.640
you already kind of wish
she was your sister?

35:08.674 --> 35:11.710
Well, I was just going to say
I like her boots,

35:11.743 --> 35:13.179
but hey, I'll take
another sister.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.883
I was finally able to trace
the remote detonator

35:17.916 --> 35:19.851
that Bruno used
in his explosive.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.687
It took me a long time

35:21.720 --> 35:23.455
because there are
parts missing.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.756
Someone tampered with it?
Yeah.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.293
And according
to touch DNA, Bruno did.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.627
It's like he built
this bomb,

35:28.660 --> 35:29.861
and then he disabled it.

35:29.895 --> 35:30.862
His girlfriend's
remote detonator

35:30.896 --> 35:32.364
wouldn't have even worked.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.433
Bad on the outside,
good on the inside.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.902
Maybe he got cold feet
and decided

35:36.935 --> 35:39.938
he didn't want to be a depraved
mass murderer after all.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.873
See, this is why
I'm a people person.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.942
'Cause the good on the inside,
it always--

35:43.975 --> 35:46.478
Abbs. Quinn...
cooking class?

35:46.512 --> 35:47.946
Right. Sorry.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.649
Okay, so the receiver
was made from

35:50.682 --> 35:54.786
a rare Lazarus 1941 hobby car.

35:54.820 --> 35:57.956
It's available in only
two stores in the area,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.959
one of which happens
to be across the street

36:00.992 --> 36:03.395
from a bank
with a brand-new,

36:03.429 --> 36:05.597
hi-def security system.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.567
Voila, Bruno.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.569
His entrance isn't
very exciting,

36:10.602 --> 36:12.438
but he made quite an exit.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.911
Personally, if I was looking
for Bruno's murderer,

36:19.945 --> 36:21.947
I would start with that guy.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.316
Can you enhance it?

36:24.350 --> 36:25.884
Yeah.
Who can't these days?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.696
BISHOP: You found out Bruno
was robbing people,

36:37.729 --> 36:39.898
you tracked him down,
you asked to be cut in.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.968
When he refused, you went
to his house the next day,

36:43.001 --> 36:44.736
and you poisoned him.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.738
Oh, yeah?
Is that what I did?

36:46.772 --> 36:47.973
Yeah, that's what
you did.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.841
What it's gonna
look like to a jury.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.977
We have a witness that
places you in his front yard.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.879
(sighs)

36:53.912 --> 36:56.415
Where's the painting, Vic?

36:56.448 --> 36:58.350
The what?

36:58.384 --> 37:00.752
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down here.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.255
This is just a total
misunderstanding, okay?

37:03.289 --> 37:05.724
I was at the hobby shop

37:05.757 --> 37:07.926
because I made a promise
to James Bruno 15 years ago.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.428
To what, poison him to death?

37:09.461 --> 37:10.562
No, to kick his ass!

37:10.596 --> 37:13.899
I devoted my life
to those kids.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.967
Bruno in particular.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.704
I spent eight weekends
in a row

37:18.737 --> 37:21.473
in Saturday detention with that
smug, arrogant little--

37:21.507 --> 37:22.908
Actually the records
say seven.
Eight!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.943
It was eight!

37:24.976 --> 37:28.314
And all that kid did was blame
other people for his problems,

37:28.347 --> 37:30.316
whining about his mom
and his dad.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.618
Making my life miserable.

37:32.651 --> 37:37.356
So I promised him I would find
him one day and pay him back.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.991
And that's what I did.

37:40.025 --> 37:40.859
I'm glad you're a man
of your word.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.028
Judge all you want.
I've been in combat.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.496
High school is worse, mister.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.532
Wait, no, wait, wait, wait!

37:46.565 --> 37:50.402
I did not go to Bruno's house
to poison him, okay?

37:52.070 --> 37:54.039
I went to apologize.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.311
(door closes)

37:59.345 --> 38:02.681
When I confronted Bruno,
he didn't fight back.

38:02.714 --> 38:05.817
He seemed, like,
resigned.

38:05.851 --> 38:08.320
Almost like he wanted me
to hit him, like he deserved it.

38:08.354 --> 38:10.322
And that's not what I wanted.

38:10.356 --> 38:13.492
So I went to his house
to say I was sorry.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.760
Anyone see you talk to him?

38:14.793 --> 38:15.927
Bruno wasn't there.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.830
Just that nasty old witch,
Frimkes.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.065
She saw the bruise
on my knuckles,

38:20.098 --> 38:22.067
figured I was the guy
that beat up Bruno,

38:22.100 --> 38:23.669
and threatened to
call the police.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.337
So I got the hell out of there.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.914
She saw that?

38:35.947 --> 38:38.684
Yeah. She did.

38:41.119 --> 38:42.621
(door closes)

38:51.897 --> 38:54.299
Come on now, baby.
Come on.

38:58.169 --> 39:02.107
I got my first pair of reading
glasses when I was 45.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.843
But your medical records
show that you have

39:04.876 --> 39:07.112
perfect eyesight,
and hearing.

39:07.145 --> 39:10.449
Agent McGee,
it's good to see you again.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.617
I-I was just, um--

39:11.650 --> 39:13.652
Walking without a cane?
No.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.988
Skipping town with
a million-dollar painting?

39:17.022 --> 39:18.123
No!

39:18.156 --> 39:19.858
Going to jail.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.560
(siren approaching)

39:21.593 --> 39:22.628
Dang!

39:23.595 --> 39:25.764
McGEE: So in addition to being
a chemistry teacher

39:25.797 --> 39:27.933
who knew 50 different ways
to poison somebody,

39:27.966 --> 39:29.901
she kept a pretty active
retirement life.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.938
She totally
Keyser Soze'd us.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.073
She what?
Keyser Soze'd.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.476
Uh, Usual Suspects,
the movie?

39:37.509 --> 39:39.445
Oh, I'm not much
of a movie guy.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.112
You know, she told us
on the drive back that

39:41.146 --> 39:42.748
she knew Bruno was a thief,

39:42.781 --> 39:44.115
but she didn't want
to go to the police

39:44.149 --> 39:45.183
because he was trying
to get clean.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.819
(elevator bell dings)

39:47.853 --> 39:50.422
She claims she
found the painting

39:50.456 --> 39:52.491
and was going to bring
it back to the police.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.793
TORRES: Yeah, killed Bruno and
kept the painting for herself.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.095
Whoa, whoa, what?

39:58.530 --> 40:01.800
(gasps) Better. Better!

40:01.833 --> 40:02.801
Who... who...

40:02.834 --> 40:03.902
Who do you think?

40:03.935 --> 40:05.671
I kind of like it.

40:08.674 --> 40:09.675
I don't.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.510
Wait a sec, wha...

40:11.543 --> 40:13.445
what's the point
of moving desks

40:13.479 --> 40:15.681
if were were just
gonna move desks?

40:15.714 --> 40:16.848
Seriously, I mean to do
something like this

40:16.882 --> 40:17.949
without consulting anyone?

40:17.983 --> 40:19.951
I am the senior
field agent.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.487
You realize that...

40:21.520 --> 40:22.788
Boss, what was that for?

40:22.821 --> 40:25.724
It comes with the territory,
Senior Field Agent.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.495
Did he just physically
assault you?

40:29.528 --> 40:31.897
TORRES: Hey, Gibbs, I feel like
you'll want to see this.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.199
We found a laptop
in Bruno's car.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.468
He was writing an
e-mail to the police.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.770
He was going to come
clean, turn everyone in.

40:38.804 --> 40:42.140
Guess he figured which
version was the real him.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.644
The good guy.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.880
I'm just not
that into movies.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.181
So what do you do for fun,
besides disrupting

40:50.215 --> 40:52.618
people's workplaces?
Broadway musicals.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.219
Okay, if you start
singing show tunes,

40:54.252 --> 40:56.087
I am going to shoot you,

40:56.121 --> 40:57.055
and then probably
shoot myself.

40:57.088 --> 41:00.492
Oh, okay, well, what do you
like to listen to?

41:00.526 --> 41:02.494
I thought you'd never ask.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.565
(up-tempo Latin music
playing loudly)

41:06.598 --> 41:08.199
Ah.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.969
(singer singing in Spanish)
*

41:11.002 --> 41:12.804
Go! Hey!

41:12.838 --> 41:16.642
*

41:16.675 --> 41:19.277
TORRES:
Hey, hey, hey!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.278
Hey.

41:20.311 --> 41:24.516
*

41:25.784 --> 41:26.885
Boss.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.253
TORRES: Hey!
Oh.

41:28.286 --> 41:29.521
Hey.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.157
(music stops)
Ha!

41:33.324 --> 41:34.660
Hey.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.570
He's gonna learn to love it.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.771
Shh.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.610
