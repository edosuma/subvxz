A find of this type is always
thrilling in this day and age.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.458
The time capsule was unearthed
by an excavation team

00:09.542 --> 00:11.166
just north of Albany.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.208
It seems it was a
community project of some kind.

00:13.291 --> 00:15.625
How far back does it date?

00:15.709 --> 00:18.667
Over 400 years.
2015, to be exact.

SHERMAN:
Cigarettes.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.500
People used to light the tips
on fire and inhale the smoke.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.166
Why?

00:37.250 --> 00:39.375
They contained a substance
called nicotine,

00:39.458 --> 00:40.792
which caused an addictive rush.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.166
That is, until they got cancer,

00:42.250 --> 00:44.500
which, at the time,
was often fatal.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.250
The odor is very interesting.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.667
Dr. Sherman, what's this thing?

00:50.750 --> 00:52.250
A communication device.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.709
A cellular telephone.

We think there still may be

I'm glad you're all here.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.792
Um... I don't know what you guys
are doing tomorrow night,

22:20.875 --> 22:23.625
but would you want to go
to a party with me?

22:23.709 --> 22:25.250
Sure. Whose party?

22:26.333 --> 22:27.417
It's Laura's.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.125
Laura from sickbay?

22:29.208 --> 22:31.125
No.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.125
Laura Huggins.

22:33.208 --> 22:35.291
Girl from the phone.

22:36.667 --> 22:37.625
I don't understand.

22:37.709 --> 22:40.417
I uploaded all
of her personal data

22:40.500 --> 22:42.583
from the phone
into the ship's computer

22:42.667 --> 22:45.375
and was able to create
a simulation.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.917
Of?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.917
Of her.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.917
Of her life. Her world.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.375
I've been spending time
with her,

22:52.458 --> 22:53.750
getting to know who she was.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.583
That kind of thing.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.542
Okay.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.458
Look, I-I know it sounds crazy,
but she really is a...

23:00.542 --> 23:02.583
<i>was </i>a special person.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.583
I would love you guys
to meet her.

23:04.667 --> 23:07.834
Look, just come to Simulator 2
tomorrow at 1900 hours,

23:07.917 --> 23:09.291
and you'll see.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.291
Okay. We'll see you there.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.625
Awesome!
You-You're gonna love her.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.250
(door whooshes shut)

23:19.333 --> 23:20.959
Did you know about this?

23:21.041 --> 23:24.083
I heard about it,
but I haven't seen it yet.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.208
You think he's working too hard?

23:26.291 --> 23:27.792
Gordon? Never.

23:27.875 --> 23:30.458
Well, this ought
to be interesting.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.208
Oh, there was something else
you wanted to talk to me about.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.667
Ah. Right.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.333
Take a walk with me?

23:43.709 --> 23:45.291
Oh, my God.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.917
Captain. What can I do for you?

23:48.000 --> 23:49.542
Guys, what the hell is this?

23:49.625 --> 23:50.792
Our quarters.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.250
Where's Topa?

23:52.333 --> 23:54.250
He has not yet returned
from school.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.500
Okay, look, I don't know
what's going on here,

23:55.583 --> 23:57.709
but we are all going
to sickbay right now.

23:57.792 --> 23:59.959
For what reason?

24:01.792 --> 24:03.625
(device chirping, beeping)

24:05.000 --> 24:07.583
Well, you boys continue
to be full of surprises.

24:07.667 --> 24:08.583
What is it?

24:08.667 --> 24:11.250
Apparently,
the Moclan biological system

24:11.333 --> 24:14.333
is extremely susceptible
to nicotine addiction.

24:14.417 --> 24:15.709
Is there precedent for this?

24:15.792 --> 24:17.250
CLAIRE:
Nobody on Earth has smoked

24:17.333 --> 24:19.083
for hundreds of years,
let alone Moclus.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.083
This is new territory.

24:21.166 --> 24:22.667
Are we in any danger?

24:22.750 --> 24:24.667
What happens
if you don't have a cigarette

24:24.750 --> 24:26.667
for more than a half hour?

24:26.750 --> 24:28.542
I do not know.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.333
-Oh, boy.
-KLYDEN: Yesterday,

24:30.417 --> 24:32.041
I was stuck in the lift
for ten minutes

24:32.125 --> 24:33.625
due to a power fluctuation.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.667
I had no cigarettes with me.

24:35.750 --> 24:37.041
I began to shake.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.542
It did not stop until I smoked.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.625
Well, my analysis indicates
that, if you keep it up,

24:41.709 --> 24:43.250
it's only gonna get worse,

24:43.333 --> 24:44.917
until, eventually,
you'll reach a point

24:45.000 --> 24:47.709
where you can't go ten seconds
without a puff.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.166
Can't you just give 'em
an injection of some kind,

24:50.250 --> 24:51.375
get 'em off the habit?

24:51.458 --> 24:52.709
Normally, yes,

24:52.792 --> 24:54.291
but at the moment,
there is no injection.

24:54.375 --> 24:57.709
These two are patient one
and patient zero.

24:57.792 --> 24:58.709
I'll have to formulate one.

24:58.792 --> 25:01.208
How long will that take?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.208
Maybe hours, maybe days.

25:03.291 --> 25:06.417
In the meantime, Topa can stay
with Ty and Marcus.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.709
Very well, Doctor.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.333
You understand
that you two are gonna need

25:10.417 --> 25:12.625
to support each other
in this, okay?

25:12.709 --> 25:14.625
No smoking.

25:21.166 --> 25:23.083
-A man... he's hungry.
-Uh, cornflakes! Cornflakes!
-Uh, he's pouring cereal!

25:23.166 --> 25:25.125
-KARL:
Ceral! A man who likes cereal!
-(shouting continues)

25:25.208 --> 25:27.583
-Cornflakes! Cornflakes!
-A man and cereal!
A man who likes cereal!

25:27.667 --> 25:30.166
-MELISSA: Uh, uh,
a man who's full of cereal!
-Uh, uh, cere-- It's cereal man!

25:30.250 --> 25:33.333
Don't just keep stopping at the
same thing! Draw something new!

25:33.417 --> 25:35.375
Cere... It's cereal man!
It's cereal man.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.083
-Right?
-MELISSA: Uh, uh...

25:37.166 --> 25:39.750
It's a cereal man! Hello?
Is it a... Is it cereal man?

25:39.834 --> 25:41.542
-It's a man who likes cereal.
Cereal man.
-Karl,

25:41.625 --> 25:42.709
what the hell is a cereal man?

25:42.792 --> 25:44.750
-I don't know. That.
-And time.

25:44.834 --> 25:45.750
(groaning)

25:45.834 --> 25:47.333
It was Julius Caesar!

25:47.417 --> 25:48.625
-What?
-What?
-Yeah.

25:48.709 --> 25:50.417
See, this is the laurel
around his head.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.458
LAURA:
Gordon, that just looks
like hair.

25:52.542 --> 25:53.542
What was the cereal?

25:53.625 --> 25:54.583
It's a Caesar salad.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.959
-Yeah. See, no, you can't draw.
-Oh, come on!

25:57.041 --> 25:58.583
A salad doesn't have
tiny little flakes like that.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.792
-They're bigger.
-A Cobb salad does.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.834
What the hell does a Cobb salad
have to do with Julius Caesar?

26:03.917 --> 26:05.417
Anybody know what time it is?

26:05.500 --> 26:07.583
Uh, I think it's got to be
about 2300 hours.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.000
Oh, military time.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.959
Is that, like, a hipster thing?

26:12.041 --> 26:13.959
No, Trisha, it's not.

26:14.041 --> 26:15.458
Listen, guys,
this has been a blast,

26:15.542 --> 26:16.625
but I really do have
to get up early tomorrow,

26:16.709 --> 26:18.125
-so...
-KELLY: Yeah. Me, too.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.750
This was so fun, though.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.417
-Oh, thank you for coming.
-Laura, it was

26:21.500 --> 26:23.542
-very nice to meet you.
-Oh, my God,
it was so nice to meet you.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.417
TALLA:
Your place is really cute.
Congrats.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.959
(John sighs)

26:28.041 --> 26:29.500
I don't know about you guys,

26:29.583 --> 26:31.625
but I need a shot of booze
and 20 hours of sleep.

26:31.709 --> 26:32.875
We should talk about this
tomorrow.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.625
How 'bout we meet
in the mess hall?

26:34.709 --> 26:35.667
I think that's a good idea.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.000
Okay. Good night.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.583
-Night.
-Night.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.792
Oh, your friends are great.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.625
(giggles)
I really liked 'em.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.959
Oh, man, they totally dug you.
I could tell.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.667
Oh, yeah? Even though we burned
their asses at Pictionary?

26:48.750 --> 26:50.792
Yeah, well, you did most
of the heavy lifting there.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.834
Sorry again
about the Dick Van Dyke one.

26:52.917 --> 26:53.959
I-I didn't know who he was,

26:54.041 --> 26:55.458
so I was just working
with what I had.

26:55.542 --> 26:58.000
It's all right.
Everyone was... fine.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.750
That's why I'm a pilot,
not a painter.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.375
Mm.

27:01.458 --> 27:05.667
Okay, so here's a question
for you, Mr. Pilot.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.542
Can you make me
not scared to fly?

27:08.625 --> 27:10.625
Um... yeah.

27:10.709 --> 27:12.125
"Um... yeah"?

27:12.208 --> 27:14.250
-(chuckling)
-I mean, I can try.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.834
What-what are you
most afraid of?

27:15.917 --> 27:17.625
-Turbulence.
-Ah.

27:17.709 --> 27:18.709
That's never gonna hurt you.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.000
But why?

27:20.083 --> 27:22.417
Well, here's why the physics

27:22.500 --> 27:24.000
-are in your favor.
-Mm-hmm.

27:24.083 --> 27:26.667
Okay, picture
the plane suspended

27:26.750 --> 27:29.208
in a giant mound of Jell-O.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.792
Okay, now, when there's
turbulence, it's almost like

27:31.875 --> 27:34.291
someone's shaking
the Jell-O plate, okay?

27:34.375 --> 27:35.709
Now, you're gonna get
bounced around,

27:35.792 --> 27:37.208
but, other than that,
you're not going anywhere.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.709
You're gonna stay
right where you are,

27:38.792 --> 27:39.834
inside that Jell-O.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.834
-You see?
-Yeah. Actually helps.

27:42.917 --> 27:45.333
Right? So, next time
you're on a bumpy flight,

27:45.417 --> 27:47.083
just picture jiggling Jell-O.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.375
And knock back five
or six cocktails.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.625
-You'll be fine.
-(chuckles)

27:57.834 --> 28:00.583
That's just for explaining
the physics of turbulence?

28:00.667 --> 28:02.959
And for everything else.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.625
(birds chirping)

28:24.041 --> 28:26.625
-(beep)
<i>-(over comm):</i>
<i>Grayson to Malloy.</i>

28:28.166 --> 28:30.208
-(beep)
<i>-Grayson to Malloy.</i>

28:30.291 --> 28:33.291
<i>It's 0830 hours.</i>
<i>You're late for your shift.</i>

28:33.375 --> 28:35.166
Oh, crap.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.583
Uh, save simulation.

28:41.041 --> 28:43.208
Ow.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.667
(panting)

28:48.500 --> 28:51.208
I know, I know.
I screwed up.

28:51.291 --> 28:53.333
It won't happen again.
I promise.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.417
See that it doesn't.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.750
We're not running
a cruise ship here.

28:55.834 --> 28:56.875
We need our helmsman
at his post.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.959
Yes, sir.
Hear you loud and clear.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.375
Captain, engineering shows
all clear for departure.

29:01.458 --> 29:02.625
All right, take us out.

29:02.709 --> 29:04.333
Aye, sir.

29:04.417 --> 29:07.542
(loud chewing sounds)

29:16.458 --> 29:17.709
Bortus, what are you eating?

29:19.750 --> 29:21.166
I apologize, Captain.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.750
Am I disturbing you?

29:22.834 --> 29:23.959
No, I'm just curious.

29:24.041 --> 29:25.333
It is called gum.

29:25.417 --> 29:26.875
According
to the ship's database,

29:26.959 --> 29:29.375
it was once used
as an addiction recovery aid.

29:29.458 --> 29:30.417
Is it helping?

29:30.500 --> 29:31.959
It is not.

29:32.041 --> 29:35.500
(phone ringing)

29:38.959 --> 29:42.667
Hey. Uh, I'm-I'm at work.
Can I call you back?

29:42.750 --> 29:44.542
I know. I know.
It was so amazing.

29:44.625 --> 29:47.166
I-I can't stop thinking
about it.

29:47.250 --> 29:49.000
Rawr.
(laughs)

29:49.083 --> 29:50.667
Okay, I'll-I'll call you later.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.709
Yeah. Oh, all the kisses.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.667
Bye.

29:57.792 --> 29:59.750
(exhales)

30:04.291 --> 30:06.041
It was, without a doubt,

30:06.125 --> 30:08.917
among the top five strangest
experiences of my life.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.834
Well, the question is
what do we do about it?

30:10.917 --> 30:12.375
I could put a block
on the program,

30:12.458 --> 30:14.667
tell him he can have it back
when it stops affecting his job.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.917
Like pulling cigarettes away
from Bortus?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, I don't know if
that's gonna work in this case.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.000
Heads up.

30:20.083 --> 30:21.583
Hey, guys.

30:21.667 --> 30:22.667
Hey.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.458
Uh, sorry again
about this morning.

30:24.542 --> 30:25.834
But, listen,
I've been dying to know.

30:25.917 --> 30:27.583
What did you think of Laura?

30:27.667 --> 30:29.875
She's... really fun.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.000
Seems like she was
a really cool person.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.709
When she was alive.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.250
I'm telling you,
she's the coolest.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.291
Ooh, wait. Look what
she sent me this morning.

30:38.375 --> 30:39.625
Check it out. She says,

30:39.709 --> 30:41.917
"Found this picture of you."
Look it.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.291
Yeah, yeah, looks just like you.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.875
Ha! Shut up, man.

30:44.959 --> 30:48.125
Listen, we wanted to talk to you
about all this,

30:48.208 --> 30:49.542
if you don't mind.

30:49.625 --> 30:50.542
Sure. What's up?

30:50.625 --> 30:51.750
KELLY:
We...

30:51.834 --> 30:54.667
don't think
this is particularly healthy.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.458
What do you mean?

30:56.542 --> 30:58.875
Dude, she's not real.

30:58.959 --> 31:01.041
Yes, she is.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.875
In-in all the ways that matter,

31:02.959 --> 31:04.000
she's real.

31:04.083 --> 31:05.000
It's a simulation.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.500
It's just like...

31:06.583 --> 31:09.000
our cowboy program
or Bortus' sex lagoon.

31:09.083 --> 31:11.041
No, it's not.
And-and here's why.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.500
Those are all programs
written by us.

31:13.583 --> 31:16.458
I mean, not the sex lagoon,
but somebody wrote that, too.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.959
This-this is different.

31:18.041 --> 31:21.667
This-this comes entirely
from her personality.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.667
Her letters, her photographs,

31:23.750 --> 31:25.542
her voice, her mannerisms--

31:25.625 --> 31:27.125
it's all her.

31:27.208 --> 31:30.250
She wrote this program
about herself.

31:30.333 --> 31:32.125
That's a real stretch, Gordon.

31:32.208 --> 31:33.166
Why?

31:33.250 --> 31:34.959
Because she's technically
not flesh and blood,

31:35.041 --> 31:35.959
she can't be real?

31:36.041 --> 31:37.709
I mean, what does that say
about Isaac?

31:37.792 --> 31:39.291
Isaac is self-aware.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.542
Is he? Do we really know that?

31:41.625 --> 31:44.959
Or is he just so sophisticated
that he can fool us all?

31:45.041 --> 31:46.583
And, if so,
wh-what does it matter?

31:46.667 --> 31:48.959
He seems real.
We treat him that way.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.333
So, in our world, he is.

31:50.417 --> 31:52.959
The universe is not governed
by individual perception.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.542

31:54.625 --> 31:55.959
And you can't just...

31:56.041 --> 31:58.000

32:02.875 --> 32:04.125
I'm not allowed to be happy?

32:04.208 --> 32:05.500
You can bang a Krill,

32:05.583 --> 32:07.875
but I can't date
a sales rep at Macy's?

32:09.625 --> 32:11.041
She lied to me.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.208
I didn't lie to myself.

32:12.291 --> 32:13.667
There's a difference.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.083

to be in a relationship

I can't answer that.

That was... that was great.

Thanks. It helps

Believe me, I know.

I just came to say goodbye.

46:28.083 --> 46:30.000
What do you mean, goodbye?

46:30.083 --> 46:31.667
Well, I got a job offer.

46:31.750 --> 46:35.250
Super far away, across country,
and I decided to take it.

46:35.333 --> 46:37.041
Well, wh-what will you be doing?

46:37.125 --> 46:39.000
Um...

46:39.083 --> 46:42.625
test pilot...
for a new aircraft design.

46:42.709 --> 46:45.417
They say it might even be able

That's amazing.
-Wow.

46:47.458 --> 46:49.000
Congratulations, man.
That's really cool.

46:49.083 --> 46:50.834
Yeah. I-I leave tomorrow.

46:50.917 --> 46:53.917
Tomorrow? That's so soon.

46:54.000 --> 46:54.875

I mean, don't forget about us

47:01.875 --> 47:03.458
just because you're

47:04.542 --> 47:06.291
I promise you this:

47:06.375 --> 47:08.375
you will not be forgotten.

47:08.458 --> 47:11.000
Good.

47:11.083 --> 47:12.792
Oh, hey,
we have to take a picture

47:12.875 --> 47:15.000
before my phone
goes in the capsule.

47:15.083 --> 47:16.500
Capsule?

47:16.583 --> 47:18.083
Yeah, they're burying
a time capsule next week,

47:18.166 --> 47:20.208
and I decided
to put my phone in the mix.

47:20.291 --> 47:22.083
Figure, I don't know,
maybe someone'll dig it up

47:22.166 --> 47:24.041

learn who I was.

47:24.125 --> 47:26.000

Could even be sooner than that.
