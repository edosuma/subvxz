00:18.728 --> 00:20.295
Yes, ma'am.

00:21.197 --> 00:22.897
Near the corner of Essex and Grand,

00:22.899 --> 00:24.999
under the elevated train.

00:25.935 --> 00:28.053
You want to get us something to eat?

00:30.940 --> 00:32.171
What do you want?

00:32.850 --> 00:34.041
Something that takes a while.

00:34.043 --> 00:35.175
I don't need that.

00:35.177 --> 00:36.353
Yes, you do.

00:46.889 --> 00:49.074
What? Move! Move!

00:49.431 --> 00:51.283
You don't touch my leg.

00:51.928 --> 00:53.894
What do you want? Move out of the way.

00:53.896 --> 00:55.038
Move.

00:55.464 --> 00:57.831
You don't touch a woman's leg
without permission.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.334
What if I came over there
and I touched your leg, huh?

01:00.336 --> 01:01.936
What are you looking at, little kid?

01:01.938 --> 01:03.771
Huh? What if I did that?

01:03.773 --> 01:07.908
Maybe even I tough the third leg
in between your other two, huh?

01:07.910 --> 01:10.311
You like that? All right.

01:14.984 --> 01:17.017
Hazel!

01:17.019 --> 01:19.053
Ain't it past your bedtime?

01:19.055 --> 01:20.721
I'm waiting for a train.

01:20.723 --> 01:23.090
When's the next train, meter maid?

01:23.092 --> 01:25.592
Should be roarin' over our heads
any minute, darling.

01:25.594 --> 01:27.027
I'm still waiting.

01:27.029 --> 01:29.997
I told you, there's nothing to wait for.

01:29.999 --> 01:31.999
I can't do the drops for you anymore.

01:32.001 --> 01:33.901
I can't pick up your drug money.

01:33.903 --> 01:35.803
It's getting out there.
I can't have that.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.137
I got a family.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.273
I got 17 years on the force.

01:39.275 --> 01:41.241
We're done, Hazel.

01:41.243 --> 01:42.710
This isn't a paper route,

01:42.712 --> 01:44.812
something you can just walk away from.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.280
We've got nine years together.

01:46.282 --> 01:49.185
I got all kinds of crap
on you, Officer Sampson.

01:49.187 --> 01:52.252
You know, that crap flows
both ways, darlin'.

01:52.254 --> 01:54.021
Look, why don't we part as friends.

01:54.023 --> 01:55.723
It was good while it lasted.

01:55.725 --> 01:57.658
You want to hear something funny?

01:57.660 --> 02:00.494
I've been trying to get someone
to take you out for a month now.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.062
Something about taking out a cop

02:02.064 --> 02:04.631
brings out the old lady
in all the tough guys.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.034
Well, it's nice to know somebody
still respects the badge.

02:07.036 --> 02:08.568
Now let me roll up my window.

02:08.571 --> 02:09.836
It's cold.

02:09.839 --> 02:12.039
Don't bother to roll it up!

02:12.063 --> 02:14.764
You're gonna be cold in
just a minute either way.

02:20.616 --> 02:23.283
Yeah. So I told him, I said, yeah.

02:23.285 --> 02:25.386
Yeah, you know. Don't touch my leg.

02:25.388 --> 02:27.821
That's right. Don't touch my leg.

02:27.823 --> 02:30.557
It's right here. What? Move!

02:33.637 --> 02:35.963
I called him again.
Said he'd be right down.

02:41.131 --> 02:43.021
Ah, morning.

02:43.606 --> 02:45.906
Forgive me for the way
I look, feel and smell,

02:45.908 --> 02:47.908
but I wasn't expecting any visitors.

02:47.910 --> 02:50.044
Well, forgive the way
I look, feel and smell,

02:50.046 --> 02:52.179
but I wasn't planning
on doing any visiting.

02:52.181 --> 02:54.882
Dr. Bull, I'm Gabrielle Ramsden
from the DA's office.

02:54.884 --> 02:57.084
I apologize for waking you
at 2:00 in the morning,

02:57.086 --> 02:59.086
but I need a favor
and the district attorney said

02:59.088 --> 03:00.354
that you were the man to ask.

03:00.356 --> 03:03.257
Well, you can tell him I already
did one, I got out of bed.

03:03.259 --> 03:04.625
Then I need another one.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.927
I'd like you to get into
that police car with me.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.429
An officer has been shot and killed

03:08.431 --> 03:10.097
and I need you to question the shooter.

03:10.099 --> 03:12.209
Don't you have detectives for that?

03:12.211 --> 03:13.600
No, detectives won't do.

03:13.602 --> 03:15.035
And time is of the essence.

03:15.037 --> 03:17.237
Look, I'm happy to explain,
but I'd really prefer

03:17.239 --> 03:18.872
to do it from a moving car.

03:18.874 --> 03:21.208
The partner of the dead officer
caught the assailant.

03:21.210 --> 03:22.776
We've got her down at the precinct.

03:22.778 --> 03:23.730
Her?

03:23.732 --> 03:24.892
You ever heard of Hazel Diaz?

03:24.916 --> 03:26.686
Why, is she saying she's heard of me?

03:27.441 --> 03:28.982
She's a Brooklyn crime boss,

03:28.984 --> 03:30.551
has been for 30 years.

03:30.553 --> 03:31.850
We've had her in custody

03:31.850 --> 03:34.284
seven other times,
but she's got this act.

03:34.286 --> 03:36.019
Well, at least I think it's an act.

03:36.021 --> 03:37.520
Whenever she's in public,

03:37.522 --> 03:39.056
she behaves like she's mentally ill.

03:39.058 --> 03:40.891
Talks to herself, big grand gestures,

03:40.893 --> 03:42.526
looks to people who aren't there.

03:42.528 --> 03:43.961
It's kind of genius.

03:43.963 --> 03:46.129
No sooner do we get her
downtown, then her lawyer

03:46.131 --> 03:48.165
comes charging in,
demanding a competency hearing.

03:48.167 --> 03:50.434
Whatever the crime,
the judge ends up sending her

03:50.436 --> 03:52.793
to Bellingham for six months
of treatment and observation,

03:52.795 --> 03:54.355
then she's right back out on the street.

03:54.379 --> 03:56.373
I'm sorry. I missed the part about me.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.009
I'm hoping you and I get to the
precinct before her lawyer does.

03:59.011 --> 04:01.378
And then I'm hoping if I get
you two in a room together,

04:01.380 --> 04:02.846
that you'll be able to testify

04:02.848 --> 04:04.581
that she's competent to stand trial.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.183
That's why I had to pull you out of bed.

04:06.185 --> 04:07.918
That's why he has his siren on,

04:07.920 --> 04:10.280
and that's why we're going 70
miles an hour through Midtown.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.793
Hazel, do you know why you're here?

04:16.795 --> 04:21.101
Three blind mice. Three blind mice.

04:21.103 --> 04:23.367
- See how they run.
- Hazel, I'm gonna begin

04:23.369 --> 04:26.130
- a forensic symptoms assessment.
- They went after the farmer's wife,

04:26.154 --> 04:29.455
and she cuts off their tails
with a carving knife.

04:30.409 --> 04:34.845
They want to know if you're a doctor.

04:34.847 --> 04:36.468
They?

04:37.016 --> 04:38.315
Well, you can just tell them

04:38.317 --> 04:41.218
I'm a fella who's here to
ask you a few questions.

04:41.556 --> 04:43.892
So you hear voices.

04:46.125 --> 04:49.526
Have you ever seen such
a sight in your life?

04:49.528 --> 04:52.529
Hey, guys. Are you listening?

04:52.531 --> 04:55.966
He's asking me if I hear voices!

05:00.639 --> 05:03.306
Do you hear the voices on
the right side of your head

05:03.308 --> 05:05.108
or the left side of your head?

05:05.110 --> 05:06.748
Top or bottom?

05:07.179 --> 05:09.079
Or do you hear them through your teeth?

05:09.081 --> 05:10.580
That's a popular choice.

05:12.985 --> 05:16.553
Did the voices tell you to
shoot that police officer?

05:16.555 --> 05:20.290
I'm starting to get tired.

05:20.292 --> 05:22.559
Were the voices telling you
Officer Sampson

05:22.561 --> 05:24.194
was dangerous? That he was a threat?

05:24.196 --> 05:25.629
No!

05:25.631 --> 05:28.854
I don't know what he's
talking about, either.

05:33.072 --> 05:35.338
♪ Three blind mice ♪

05:35.340 --> 05:37.808

Hazel.

05:45.764 --> 05:47.126
Hazel.

05:47.899 --> 05:48.911
Dear.

05:49.648 --> 05:51.448
No more talking.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.224
A shot in the dark.

05:54.226 --> 05:56.159
Is this your attorney?

05:56.757 --> 05:57.861
Hmm.

05:57.863 --> 06:00.397
I'm afraid we haven't had the
pleasure. I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

06:00.399 --> 06:02.499
Sean Perkins. I represent Ms. Diaz.

06:02.501 --> 06:03.867
And this meeting is over.

06:03.869 --> 06:05.702
Interesting, isn't it?

06:05.704 --> 06:08.505
That you knew the precise precinct

06:08.507 --> 06:10.607
she would be at
in the middle of the night,

06:10.609 --> 06:13.944
when your client is in what appears to be

06:13.946 --> 06:16.246
the middle of a psychotic break.

06:16.248 --> 06:19.516
If not her, who could
have gotten word to you?

06:19.518 --> 06:22.486
I'm sorry. I thought I made it clear

06:22.488 --> 06:24.855
that this meeting is over.

06:30.095 --> 06:32.462
You're a riveting conversationalist.

06:37.736 --> 06:39.836
And as for the rest of you,

06:39.838 --> 06:42.439
I look forward to chatting again soon.

06:49.915 --> 06:53.283
Hey, hey. Letting the hubby
know you're almost done?

06:53.285 --> 06:54.718
No hubby, it's my neighbor.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.453
She's watching my seven-month-old.

06:56.455 --> 06:58.788
Oh, congratulations. Boy or a girl?

06:59.685 --> 07:01.055
Shih Tzu.

07:01.057 --> 07:01.958
Boy.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.393
Tom Jones.

07:04.282 --> 07:05.529
I don't get it.

07:05.531 --> 07:07.030
You ever hear a Shih Tzu bark?

07:07.828 --> 07:10.133
You know what a deep voice Tom Jones has?

07:10.135 --> 07:11.623
Got it.

07:12.374 --> 07:13.904
Do you want to grab some breakfast?

07:13.906 --> 07:15.672
No. I really need to know

07:15.674 --> 07:17.307
what happened in your meeting with Hazel.

07:17.309 --> 07:18.508
You know, I can multitask.

07:18.510 --> 07:21.011
I can eat and talk.

07:21.013 --> 07:23.213
I'm not gonna forget
between here and the diner.

07:23.215 --> 07:25.348
Let's just do it here.

07:26.221 --> 07:28.118
Okay.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.599
Uh...

07:31.223 --> 07:33.857
She didn't answer any of
the assessment questions.

07:34.396 --> 07:36.960
I had a hunch that's how
she was gonna play it.

07:36.962 --> 07:38.962
She's been to this rodeo before.

07:38.964 --> 07:40.931
The key thing is, she's
conflating symptoms

07:40.933 --> 07:43.567
of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

07:43.569 --> 07:46.803
And that is usually a sign
that someone is a fake.

07:46.805 --> 07:49.406
And if you haven't studied
the nuances of mental illness,

07:49.408 --> 07:52.142
and you're not up-to-date
on your diagnostics,

07:52.144 --> 07:54.110
she's giving a very credible performance.

07:54.112 --> 07:55.512
What are you saying?

07:55.514 --> 07:57.581
I'm saying the judge may believe her.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.718
No. I can't let Hazel Diaz
walk an eighth time,

08:01.720 --> 08:03.111
now when she's killed a cop.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.789
Hey, Ms. ADA, I'm on your team.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.724
And the lawyer knows that I'm on to them.

08:07.726 --> 08:09.459
- How can you be sure?
- Well,

08:09.461 --> 08:10.821
the minute he walked into the room,

08:10.845 --> 08:12.262
she knew to shut up.

08:12.264 --> 08:15.398
It was absolutely clear
she knew he was coming.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.701
And how is that possible
if she can't tell reality

08:17.703 --> 08:19.135
from fiction?

08:19.137 --> 08:20.937
I mean, did she call him?

08:21.766 --> 08:24.808
Will you testify to all of that
at the competency hearing?

08:24.810 --> 08:26.910
Will I be able to buy
you coffee and eggs?

08:26.912 --> 08:28.078
Not this morning, no.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.346
Well, then I guess I'll have to testify

08:29.348 --> 08:31.514
- so that I can see you again.
- Well, then I guess you will.

08:31.516 --> 08:34.196
- Are we sharing a police car home?
- There's one out there for you.

08:34.198 --> 08:35.831
I'm uptown; I'm taking a subway.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.659
Hmm. You're tough.

08:37.660 --> 08:38.822
You're persistent.

08:38.823 --> 08:41.224
Oh, I haven't even taken my
persistence out of the box yet.

08:41.796 --> 08:43.493
Good night, Dr. Bull.

08:43.495 --> 08:45.061
And thank you.

08:45.634 --> 08:48.565
Mark my words, as soon as I'm gone,

08:48.567 --> 08:50.834
you're gonna be very hungry.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

09:17.491 --> 09:18.757
Good morning, Mrs. Sampson.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.892
Good morning, ADA Ramsden.

09:21.554 --> 09:23.435
So what do you think our chances are?

09:23.437 --> 09:24.436
How do you mean?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.638
Chances of getting that lying murderer

09:26.640 --> 09:29.341
to take responsibility
for killing my husband.

09:29.343 --> 09:31.543
To stand trial for
the first time in her life.

09:31.545 --> 09:34.081
We're doing everything
we can, Mrs. Sampson.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.972
In fact, this gentleman
standing next to you

09:35.974 --> 09:38.240
is here to testify that
there's no reason in the world

09:38.241 --> 09:40.040
for Hazel Diaz not to stand trial.

09:40.522 --> 09:41.609
Dr. Bull,

09:41.611 --> 09:43.644
as a licensed psychologist

09:43.646 --> 09:45.713
with three PhDs in human behavior,

09:45.715 --> 09:47.882
could I trouble you
for your observations?

09:47.884 --> 09:49.450
Of course.

09:49.452 --> 09:50.918
Initially, Ms. Diaz displayed

09:50.920 --> 09:52.786
the textbook signs of schizophrenia:

09:52.788 --> 09:54.522
delusions and hallucinations;

09:54.524 --> 09:56.190
carry on conversations with people

09:56.192 --> 09:57.525
who were not in the room with us.

09:57.527 --> 10:00.194
That sounds serious. Did Ms. Diaz display

10:00.196 --> 10:02.329
any other signs of mental illness?

10:02.331 --> 10:04.532
She did. She displayed signs

10:04.534 --> 10:06.672
of rapid and disorganized speech,

10:06.674 --> 10:07.986
which is typically

10:07.988 --> 10:10.004
a symptom of bipolar disorder,

10:10.006 --> 10:12.006
not schizophrenia.

10:12.008 --> 10:13.409
Is it common for a person

10:13.433 --> 10:14.808
to simultaneously display signs

10:14.810 --> 10:17.011
of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder?

10:17.434 --> 10:19.914
No, not common. Not normal.

10:19.916 --> 10:21.849
Not... credible,

10:21.851 --> 10:23.484
frankly. When a person

10:23.486 --> 10:25.219
shows symptoms of several disorders,

10:25.221 --> 10:27.454
it is almost always a key indicator

10:27.456 --> 10:29.423
the person is malingering.

10:29.425 --> 10:30.457
I'm sorry.

10:30.459 --> 10:32.326
Can you define malingering, Dr. Bull?

10:32.949 --> 10:36.564
Malingering is when a person
fakes a mental illness

10:36.566 --> 10:38.766
in order to evade responsibility
for something.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.901
And in your expert opinion,

10:40.903 --> 10:42.603
is Ms. Diaz malingering?

10:42.605 --> 10:44.305
Oh, in my expert opinion,

10:44.307 --> 10:46.905
Ms. Diaz is the queen of malingering.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.171
Based solely on the fact

10:48.173 --> 10:51.045
that she was conflating symptoms
of several illnesses?

10:51.047 --> 10:52.387
Oh, no,

10:52.389 --> 10:53.681
not... solely.

10:53.683 --> 10:56.664
It was also hard to miss
Ms. Diaz's response

10:56.666 --> 10:59.381
when her attorney
was walking into the room.

10:59.383 --> 11:02.613
The second he walked in,
he ordered her to stop talking,

11:02.615 --> 11:04.626
and she did... it was obvious

11:04.628 --> 11:06.643
she recognized him,
obvious she was not surprised

11:06.645 --> 11:08.462
to see him, obvious she
knew he was coming,

11:08.464 --> 11:12.600
and lucid enough to respond
to all of his commands.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.635
- So to sum up...
- To sum up,

11:14.637 --> 11:17.894
this woman is clearly not mentally ill.

11:17.896 --> 11:20.274
She knew exactly
what she was doing that night,

11:20.763 --> 11:24.044
and she is perfectly capable
of standing trial.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.413
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

11:31.174 --> 11:32.853
Dr. Bull...

11:33.259 --> 11:37.725
approximately how long did your
interview with Hazel Diaz take?

11:37.727 --> 11:39.511
Perhaps 20 minutes.

11:39.513 --> 11:42.029
It might well have lasted
longer, but as I mentioned...

11:42.644 --> 11:43.832
you showed up.

11:43.834 --> 11:47.351
So on the basis of a single
20-minute encounter,

11:47.353 --> 11:50.638
you think you can diagnose
this woman's mental state?

11:50.640 --> 11:53.393
I didn't claim
to diagnose her mental state,

11:53.395 --> 11:55.276
whatever your definition of that is.

11:55.278 --> 11:57.578
I am simply here to offer

11:57.580 --> 11:59.790
my expert opinion as to whether or not

11:59.792 --> 12:02.176
- she is competent to stand trial.
- Are you aware

12:02.178 --> 12:04.999
that this woman has been
suffering from schizophrenia

12:05.001 --> 12:06.820
for over two decades now?

12:06.822 --> 12:08.722
I am aware that that's her claim.

12:08.724 --> 12:10.795
But you do understand
that during the incident

12:10.797 --> 12:13.627
with Officer Sampson, and during

12:13.629 --> 12:14.928
your subsequent interview,

12:14.930 --> 12:17.498
she was in the middle
of a psychotic episode?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.301
Again, I'm aware that's her claim.

12:20.303 --> 12:21.235
And just to be clear,

12:21.237 --> 12:22.637
the incident that you're speaking of

12:22.661 --> 12:25.773
was cold-blooded murder
at point-blank range.

12:25.775 --> 12:28.215
Execution. Assassination.

12:28.217 --> 12:29.743
Those might be better terms

12:29.745 --> 12:31.879
- for the "incident."
- Objection, Your Honor.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.136
Nonresponsive answer.

12:33.161 --> 12:34.716
And by the way, if she was in the middle

12:34.718 --> 12:36.759
of a psychotic state, she
would never have been able

12:36.783 --> 12:38.418
to communicate with you the way she did.

12:38.443 --> 12:39.815
Overruled.

12:39.856 --> 12:40.993
All of it.

12:40.995 --> 12:41.989
Overruled.

12:41.991 --> 12:45.023
Well, I-I'd like to remind
Dr. Bull and the court

12:45.025 --> 12:48.925
- that he is supposed to remain unbiased.
- And I would like

12:48.927 --> 12:50.848
to remind the court
that what's in question today

12:50.872 --> 12:51.555
is whether or not

12:51.557 --> 12:53.634
Ms. Diaz is competent to stand trial.

12:53.636 --> 12:55.569
And in order to be competent
to stand trial,

12:55.571 --> 12:57.891
she must be able to effectively
communicate with her lawyer

12:57.915 --> 12:59.843
and understand the charges against her.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.606
That is the criteria, and in all my years

13:02.608 --> 13:05.656
of practicing psychology,
I have never seen anyone

13:05.658 --> 13:10.284
in a psychotic state communicate
with the extraordinary finesse

13:10.286 --> 13:13.420
that Hazel Diaz did that night.

13:13.422 --> 13:14.855
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.657
Mr. Perkins, if you don't have

13:16.659 --> 13:18.392
any more questions for the good doctor,

13:18.394 --> 13:20.427
can we move on with this hearing?

13:21.659 --> 13:23.564
Yes, Your Honor.

13:23.566 --> 13:25.599
Witness is excused.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.305
In light of this testimony,

13:31.753 --> 13:33.968
I believe that Hazel Diaz is indeed able

13:33.970 --> 13:35.508
to both understand the nature

13:35.510 --> 13:37.945
and consequences of these proceedings,

13:38.343 --> 13:40.314
and is fully capable...

13:40.845 --> 13:42.616
of assisting in her own defense.

13:43.014 --> 13:46.720
Hazel Diaz, you are
therefore fit to stand trial,

13:47.525 --> 13:49.329
which will commence this Wednesday.

14:04.674 --> 14:06.562
_

14:06.587 --> 14:08.387
_

14:13.114 --> 14:14.847
Talk to her yet?

14:16.118 --> 14:17.465
No.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.600
No, I'm a terrible friend.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.622
Truth is,

14:22.624 --> 14:24.124
I don't know what to say to her.

14:24.710 --> 14:25.846
You say what you feel.

14:25.848 --> 14:27.648
I don't know what I feel.

14:28.751 --> 14:30.751
I feel bad for her.

14:30.753 --> 14:32.719
On the other hand, what she did

14:32.721 --> 14:35.421
was a federal crime, and it
almost cost a man his business.

14:35.423 --> 14:37.738
I get that, but still, she's my friend.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.821
I can't just shut that off.

14:40.829 --> 14:42.329
Have you spoken to her?

14:42.331 --> 14:43.812
Left her a bunch of messages,

14:43.836 --> 14:46.855
- but she hasn't called me back.
- Hasn't called me back, either.

14:47.403 --> 14:49.436
Bull told me to start
interviewing candidates

14:49.438 --> 14:51.104
to take her place.

14:51.106 --> 14:54.074
Oh, well, with any luck,
you won't find anyone.

14:54.076 --> 14:56.963
Come on, off the fence.
Tell us how you really feel.

14:58.514 --> 14:59.882
I miss her.

15:00.249 --> 15:02.549
And yeah, she did a bad thing.

15:03.052 --> 15:04.240
But who among us

15:04.242 --> 15:06.212
hasn't made a boneheaded mistake?

15:06.212 --> 15:08.613
It's part of the journey.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.615
Okay? And I think

15:10.617 --> 15:13.684
if she had it to do over,
she'd do it differently.

15:14.424 --> 15:16.487
So... anyway,

15:16.489 --> 15:18.489
good luck with your interviews.

15:19.258 --> 15:20.903
Not.

15:24.851 --> 15:26.051
This is not my first time

15:26.075 --> 15:27.574
at the barbecue, missy.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.667
Girl calls guy out of the blue.

15:29.669 --> 15:30.968
It's only been a week.

15:30.970 --> 15:32.937
Buys him breakfast. Next thing you know,

15:32.939 --> 15:34.538
girl has expectations,

15:34.959 --> 15:36.955
thinks she can take... certain liberties.

15:36.957 --> 15:39.187
I have my moral code to consider.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.212
And my reputation. So...

15:41.214 --> 15:43.014
I think we ought to
slow things down here.

15:43.016 --> 15:45.249
Let's start with breakfast, right?

15:45.595 --> 15:47.178
I say we go halfsies.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.286
What do I owe you, six bucks?

15:49.288 --> 15:52.323
I'm guessing that's not
your first cup of coffee today.

15:52.325 --> 15:53.758
Touché.

15:53.760 --> 15:57.161
So, to what do I owe this...
bountiful feast?

15:57.163 --> 15:59.460
I had a meeting in
the judge's chambers yesterday.

15:59.462 --> 16:00.738
The other side admits

16:00.740 --> 16:02.800
she shot the officer
at point-blank range.

16:03.279 --> 16:04.969
- But?
- But...

16:04.971 --> 16:08.005
they're pleading not guilty
by reason of insanity.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.307
Hmm. You can't really be surprised.

16:10.953 --> 16:13.033
She's spent her whole life
preparing for this moment.

16:13.057 --> 16:14.578
Mm-hmm. And now, of course,

16:14.580 --> 16:16.647
each side is entitled to hire an expert.

16:16.649 --> 16:19.417
Theirs to prove that, while
she's competent to stand trial,

16:19.419 --> 16:22.186
she's still mentally ill and was
so at the time of the shooting.

16:22.188 --> 16:25.009
And ours to prove
that she's not crazy at all.

16:26.135 --> 16:28.092
And I told them I want you.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.354
And they went nuts,

16:30.683 --> 16:32.404
which is how I know
I made the right choice.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.699
And the judge approved it.

16:35.311 --> 16:36.979
So, what do you say?

16:37.336 --> 16:40.104
The DA's office has asked me to
serve as forensic psychologist

16:40.106 --> 16:42.006
on the Hazel Diaz case.

16:42.008 --> 16:43.741
Wait, I'm confused.

16:43.743 --> 16:46.377
They're hiring you and not TAC?

16:46.379 --> 16:48.345
I don't mean to get all gooey on you,

16:48.347 --> 16:51.415
but when they hire me,
if the need is there,

16:51.417 --> 16:53.451
they get all of you, too.

16:53.453 --> 16:54.825
I mean, we won't be doing

16:54.827 --> 16:57.621
our usual voir dire and all of that,

16:57.623 --> 17:00.191
but I will be counting on the four of you

17:00.193 --> 17:01.892
to help me do my job,

17:01.894 --> 17:03.294
which is to convince the jury

17:03.296 --> 17:05.796
that this was exactly what it looks like:

17:06.134 --> 17:08.598
- a cold-blooded killing.
- Well...

17:08.601 --> 17:10.166
we're here for you, boss.

17:10.169 --> 17:11.669
Good. Tomorrow morning,

17:11.671 --> 17:14.038
a pile of court documents
and medical records will arrive,

17:14.040 --> 17:16.807
and I need all hands on deck
to go through them.

17:16.809 --> 17:18.656
What exactly is it
that we're looking for?

17:18.681 --> 17:19.830
I don't know.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.549
Basically, I've got two arrows
in my quiver.

17:23.930 --> 17:25.648
I get to do another assessment with her.

17:25.651 --> 17:27.151
Didn't you already do one of those?

17:27.153 --> 17:29.420
- Sure did.
- And since you've already proven

17:29.422 --> 17:31.989
that she's capable of standing trial,

17:31.991 --> 17:34.725
how is a second assessment
at a later date gonna prove

17:34.727 --> 17:37.228
that she was insane
at the time of the killing?

17:37.230 --> 17:39.897
Precisely. Which is why
I need to use the assessment

17:39.899 --> 17:41.465
to get her to implicate herself.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.968
You're gonna try to get her to confess?

17:43.970 --> 17:45.202
A man can dream.

17:46.307 --> 17:48.139
And what about the "second arrow"?

17:50.511 --> 17:53.144
Her insanity defense
holds water because...

17:53.723 --> 17:56.211
the crime itself appears illogical.

17:56.213 --> 17:58.783
She had no apparent reason
to kill Officer Sampson.

17:59.228 --> 18:02.086
It <i> appears</i> completely random.

18:02.565 --> 18:05.289
Just like the nursery rhyme
she was singing

18:05.291 --> 18:07.124
during our first interview.

18:07.510 --> 18:08.826
But what if it wasn't?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.495
What if she executed Sampson

18:11.497 --> 18:13.297
for a reason?

18:13.868 --> 18:15.533
Then she doesn't look so crazy.

18:15.953 --> 18:17.902
Let's look into everyone
in Sampson's life.

18:17.904 --> 18:20.838
Okay. I'll reach out
to the wife, to the kids.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.106
I'll track down his partner,

18:22.108 --> 18:23.509
talk to other people he worked with.

18:23.511 --> 18:25.511
I'll start poring through
those documents tomorrow.

18:25.535 --> 18:27.812
Do you need me to help you prep
for your assessment?

18:27.814 --> 18:29.180
That'd be great.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.384
And, uh, so, who's looking
into the cyber side of things?

18:34.055 --> 18:36.595
Well, Marissa's working on that.
We'll find somebody.

18:36.597 --> 18:38.489
Just takes a little while.

18:38.491 --> 18:41.122
Oh, 'cause I know someone
who's really good,

18:41.124 --> 18:42.660
and, uh, instantly available.

18:42.662 --> 18:44.728
This is not a conversation
you want to have with me.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.564
No. No. This is not a conversation

18:46.566 --> 18:48.299
you want to have with us.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.401
Because you're afraid we
might change your mind.

18:50.403 --> 18:51.545
Speak for yourself.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.037
Please.

18:53.039 --> 18:54.438
Wow.

18:55.076 --> 18:58.142
I would have hoped that we could
have at least talked about it.

18:58.628 --> 18:59.939
By all means.

18:59.941 --> 19:01.445
Feel free to talk among yourselves...

19:01.447 --> 19:03.247
when you're off the clock,

19:03.566 --> 19:06.217
or at your new place of employment.

19:26.042 --> 19:27.720
He's not home.

19:27.745 --> 19:29.319
Getting ready for the big evaluation?

19:29.321 --> 19:32.088
Chunk's putting the equipment
in the car as we speak.

19:32.090 --> 19:35.506
Well, then maybe this should wait.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.587
It about Hazel Diaz?

19:37.589 --> 19:39.489
It's not good.

19:39.954 --> 19:42.025
Knowledge is power. Let me have it.

19:42.027 --> 19:45.074
I was reviewing Hazel's
early medical records,

19:45.076 --> 19:47.964
and I realized the woman that
Hazel calls her mother...

19:47.966 --> 19:49.733
is actually her aunt.

19:49.735 --> 19:52.433
- And this is important why?
- Because it's a consequence

19:52.435 --> 19:55.005
of her real mother having
been in a mental institution

19:55.007 --> 19:58.608
from her early 20s until
she passed 11 years ago.

19:59.056 --> 20:00.377
Being treated for what?

20:00.588 --> 20:01.854
Schizophrenia.

20:01.856 --> 20:03.956
- Oh, God...
- I only mention it

20:03.958 --> 20:05.991
because according to the literature,

20:05.993 --> 20:07.553
if you have a parent with schizophrenia,

20:07.577 --> 20:09.995
you are 13 times more
likely to have it yourself.

20:09.997 --> 20:11.797
Wow, there's a handy fact
I'm sure the defense

20:11.821 --> 20:13.320
- can't wait to share.
- Bull...

20:13.988 --> 20:17.269
is it possible that Hazel isn't lying?

20:18.892 --> 20:20.191
No.

20:20.244 --> 20:22.541
I was with her an hour
after she committed the crime.

20:22.543 --> 20:24.495
The lady was acting.

20:24.497 --> 20:27.112
It's true, it's 13 times more likely

20:27.114 --> 20:29.848
if a parent is schizophrenic
that you could be, too,

20:29.850 --> 20:32.585
but it's a hundred times
more likely if you're a criminal

20:32.587 --> 20:35.020
and someone makes you aware
of those statistics,

20:35.022 --> 20:38.357
that you will find a way
to use them to your advantage.

20:38.798 --> 20:40.398
I got to go.

20:40.695 --> 20:41.891
I...

20:42.763 --> 20:45.264
<i>You bring a lot of memory cards?</i>

20:45.266 --> 20:47.312
- Oh, 12 hours' worth.
- Good.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.034
It may take that long
to get her to crack.

20:49.036 --> 20:50.669
- When you say crack...
- The longer

20:50.671 --> 20:52.572
I can keep her talking,
answering questions,

20:52.574 --> 20:54.039
the more likely she is to slip up

20:54.041 --> 20:56.609
and reveal something
the ADA can use on the stand.

20:56.611 --> 20:57.876
And if she doesn't?

20:58.449 --> 21:00.112
She will.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.082
Nobody can keep up that act all day long.

21:04.372 --> 21:05.653
<i>Each of these memory cards</i>

21:05.677 --> 21:06.619
is good for one hour.

21:06.621 --> 21:08.671
When the camera dings, you change it out.

21:08.673 --> 21:09.922
Got it.

21:09.924 --> 21:12.591
As soon as you're done, and they
give you your cell phone back,

21:12.593 --> 21:15.068
shoot me a text, and I'll be
back with the car in a flash.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.496
- Could be a while.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.033
Looks like the guest
of honor has arrived.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.057
Hmm.

21:47.164 --> 21:48.627
Is that for me?

21:50.765 --> 21:52.002
Ah.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.601
I don't want to miss a word.

21:56.674 --> 21:58.170
And you are...?

21:58.634 --> 21:59.838
Dr. Jason Bull.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.907
We've actually met a couple times before.

22:01.909 --> 22:05.177
I interviewed you shortly after
the murder of Officer Sampson,

22:05.179 --> 22:08.280
and saw you in court
during your competency hearing.

22:08.811 --> 22:10.416
Yes.

22:10.418 --> 22:12.584
I remember seeing you in court.

22:12.586 --> 22:15.654
Hmm. But not our earlier encounter?

22:18.225 --> 22:20.296
I heard you talking about it in court...

22:20.298 --> 22:21.816
You're really good.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.328
You never break character, do you?

22:23.330 --> 22:25.197
So this character
you're doing right now...

22:25.199 --> 22:27.332
she's, um, pretending to be on her meds?

22:27.334 --> 22:28.701
Is that...?

22:28.703 --> 22:30.502
Is that the idea?

22:30.504 --> 22:33.372
And the character
that I met the other night,

22:33.374 --> 22:34.948
um, at the police precinct...

22:34.950 --> 22:37.176
she didn't have the benefit
of her meds because she,

22:37.178 --> 22:39.845
presumably, was in the middle
of a psychotic break.

22:39.847 --> 22:41.680
Do I have the story right?

22:46.120 --> 22:49.955
Let's see what medications
they have you on.

22:49.957 --> 22:52.291
Ooh. Ah, that's a big one.

22:54.462 --> 22:56.929
Injections or oral medication?

22:56.931 --> 22:59.331
Oh. Oral meds.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.066
Much easier to avoid.

23:01.068 --> 23:02.434
What do you do?

23:02.436 --> 23:04.870
Spit 'em out when the orderly
turns his back?

23:05.284 --> 23:08.073
Okay. Let's get started.

23:10.845 --> 23:12.811
Tell me about Officer Sampson.

23:12.813 --> 23:14.126
Who?

23:14.749 --> 23:16.545
The man you shot.

23:18.172 --> 23:20.219
Is that who it was? Was that his name?

23:20.221 --> 23:22.154
According to his widow

23:22.156 --> 23:24.356
and his children

23:24.358 --> 23:26.291
and the officers

23:26.847 --> 23:28.861
that he worked with,
yes, that was his name.

23:28.863 --> 23:32.564
Sorry. I don't think
I can help you with that.

23:32.566 --> 23:34.933
Because you don't remember
anything that happened?

23:35.356 --> 23:36.869
Hmm.

23:36.871 --> 23:38.904
What's the last thing you do remember?

23:40.574 --> 23:44.243
I... took a nap late in the afternoon.

23:45.282 --> 23:46.612
Do you remember waking up?

23:46.614 --> 23:50.415
Yes. In the hospital... the next morning.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.785
So that's... that.

23:52.787 --> 23:55.821
You just don't remember
anything in between.

23:57.753 --> 23:59.691
I guess we don't have anything
to talk about.

23:59.693 --> 24:02.494
Yeah, mm-hmm, I guess not.

24:05.099 --> 24:08.734
Okay, well, I just
have a few more questions.

24:08.736 --> 24:10.636
Um, you remember what

24:10.638 --> 24:13.739
you were wearing when
you laid down to take the nap?

24:14.186 --> 24:16.041
Your clothes... what'd you have on?

24:17.231 --> 24:19.645
What difference does... it make?

24:19.647 --> 24:21.547
Oh, it makes a huge difference to me.

24:21.549 --> 24:24.183
Well, feels like
it's a waste of time to me.

24:24.185 --> 24:27.519
I mean, it's not like we have all day.

24:27.521 --> 24:30.088
Oh, no. We do.

24:30.090 --> 24:31.990
That's the best part of this.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.726
We have all the time in the world.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.101
And then I woke up in the hospital.

24:43.103 --> 24:44.636
And that was the first time

24:44.638 --> 24:47.272
you saw the raincoat and the boots?

24:47.274 --> 24:49.875
Yes, yes and yes.

24:49.877 --> 24:52.611
Just like I told you before.

24:52.613 --> 24:54.947
I have no memory of putting them on.

24:54.949 --> 24:57.916
I just remember laying down on my bed

24:57.918 --> 25:00.018
to take a nap

25:00.020 --> 25:02.688
and waking up at the hospital.

25:02.690 --> 25:05.490
No memory of loading the gun,
hiding it in your coat,

25:05.492 --> 25:07.593
being 18 inches from the officer's face

25:07.595 --> 25:09.661
and pulling the trigger,
watching his head explode?

25:09.663 --> 25:13.098
No, no <i> and</i> no.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.500
How many times would you like to hear it?

25:15.502 --> 25:17.569
A few.

25:17.571 --> 25:19.238
But give me a second.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.474
I need to change this memory card.

25:24.011 --> 25:26.645
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

25:26.647 --> 25:28.480
- I need a nap.
- No, ma'am.

25:28.482 --> 25:30.115
You're dangerous when you take a nap.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.056
So, the night of the murder,

25:33.058 --> 25:34.686
which hand did you use

25:34.688 --> 25:37.522
to pull the trigger
when you shot Officer Sampson?

25:38.145 --> 25:40.792
For the 300th time,

25:40.794 --> 25:44.968
I have <i> no</i> memory
of shooting Officer Sampson.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.431
And why do you think that is?

25:46.946 --> 25:49.201
Why do you think you don't remember?

25:49.203 --> 25:51.670
I have already told you <i> all</i> of this.

25:52.242 --> 25:54.006
Like you, I have forgotten.

25:54.008 --> 25:56.241
I have no memory of it.

25:56.914 --> 25:58.443
So why don't you tell me

25:58.874 --> 26:01.613
one more time... please?

26:02.086 --> 26:04.416
I was in the middle of a psychotic break,

26:04.418 --> 26:06.451
and I never remember anything

26:06.453 --> 26:09.888
that happens during a psychotic break.

26:13.855 --> 26:15.127
All right.

26:17.559 --> 26:19.680
When you have these psychotic
breaks, you hear voices?

26:19.704 --> 26:20.632
You hear voices, right?

26:20.634 --> 26:22.067
I do.

26:22.069 --> 26:23.936
And on the night
of Officer Sampson's murder,

26:23.938 --> 26:26.038
- do you remember hearing voices?
- I do.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.406
And what were they saying?

26:27.408 --> 26:29.107
You know, I don't know.

26:29.109 --> 26:32.244
Uh, nonsense, gibberish,
three blind mice.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.380
Three blind mice?

26:36.036 --> 26:37.683
Hmm.

26:37.685 --> 26:40.085
You know, you've spent
the last seven hours telling me

26:40.087 --> 26:42.721
you don't remember anything
about that night.

26:42.723 --> 26:45.357
I mean, now you remember hearing voices

26:45.359 --> 26:47.259
and what they were saying?

26:47.261 --> 26:48.827
Hmm.

26:48.829 --> 26:49.755
Maybe you remember what you

26:49.780 --> 26:51.926
- were wearing.
- I do not.

26:51.928 --> 26:53.409
Or which hand was holding the gun

26:53.434 --> 26:54.967
- that pulled the trigger.
- I do not.

26:54.969 --> 26:57.202
Or why you killed Office Sampson
in the first place.

26:57.204 --> 26:58.770
I do not!

26:58.772 --> 27:01.006
We have a real problem here, Hazel,

27:01.008 --> 27:03.809
because there's no such thing
as having a psychotic break

27:03.811 --> 27:05.310
and remembering some things

27:05.312 --> 27:07.879
and not remembering other things, hmm?

27:07.881 --> 27:10.582
Unless, of course, you're lying.

27:11.155 --> 27:12.951
Are you a liar, Hazel?

27:12.953 --> 27:14.052
I'm not a liar!

27:14.054 --> 27:15.754
I am not lying!

27:15.756 --> 27:17.656
- Oh, my goodness.
- I am not lying!

27:17.658 --> 27:19.391
- I am not lying!
- You're not

27:19.393 --> 27:20.513
losing your temper, are you?

27:20.537 --> 27:21.827
I am <i> not</i> lying!

27:21.829 --> 27:23.337
Because that would be
almost impossible...

27:23.339 --> 27:24.518
- I am not a liar...
- given the medication

27:24.542 --> 27:25.764
you're supposedly taking.

27:25.766 --> 27:28.133
- I am not a liar!
- Unless you're not taking it!

27:28.135 --> 27:30.902
I am not a liar!

27:33.468 --> 27:36.506
Well, this has been fascinating.

27:37.057 --> 27:38.343
But you know what they say.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.512
All good things must come to an end.

27:40.514 --> 27:43.548
Not to worry. I got what I need.

27:45.189 --> 27:46.451
I know.

27:46.453 --> 27:49.254
I feel the same way.
I'm gonna miss you, too,

27:49.256 --> 27:52.591
but we'll always have the
Bellingham Visitors Lounge.

27:52.593 --> 27:54.593
Now, treat her nice.

27:54.595 --> 27:56.762
She's a sweetheart,
notwithstanding the whole

27:56.764 --> 27:58.964
cold-blooded killer thing!

28:08.030 --> 28:11.675
So, with four years
at Trial Analysis Corporation,

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
I'm curious, what possessed you to leave?

28:13.702 --> 28:16.036
I've reached out to them
a number of times

28:16.038 --> 28:17.679
regarding your work history.

28:18.607 --> 28:20.707
No one's gotten back to me.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.044
Marissa Morgan...
was she your direct supervisor?

28:24.046 --> 28:26.947
Yes. And a great person to work for.

28:26.949 --> 28:29.182
And, I mean, I just...

28:31.053 --> 28:33.386
I was just at a place where it felt like

28:33.388 --> 28:35.522
I had gone as far as I could go.

28:35.906 --> 28:37.223
I'm young

28:37.225 --> 28:39.926
and I wanted to see
what else was out there.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.762
And according to this,
you're self-taught.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.258
- Hmm.
- Which is very impressive.

28:45.260 --> 28:48.201
Yeah, I mean, I've always loved computers

28:48.203 --> 28:51.404
and code and-and the Internet,

28:51.406 --> 28:54.582
and I was just sort of
born at the right moment.

28:54.584 --> 28:55.709
Or as I like to say,

28:55.711 --> 28:58.477
we were both sort of born
at the right moment.

28:58.479 --> 28:59.879
Terrific.

28:59.881 --> 29:02.749
Well, this all looks wonderful. I mean,

29:02.751 --> 29:04.560
we have a couple of more hurtles.

29:04.562 --> 29:06.642
There are some other people
I would need you to meet,

29:06.666 --> 29:09.589
but I'm not anticipating
it's anything you can't handle.

29:09.591 --> 29:11.591
No problem. Just say the word.

29:11.593 --> 29:13.913
And we're still waiting on
your security clearance history.

29:13.937 --> 29:17.021
We outsource that,
so it could take a week or so.

29:17.166 --> 29:20.500
Well, I don't think there are
going to be any surprises there.

29:20.502 --> 29:23.069
- Have a great day.
- You, too.

29:26.821 --> 29:28.274
<i>And on the night
of Officer Sampson's murder,</i>

29:28.276 --> 29:30.210
- do you remember hearing voices?
- I do.

29:30.212 --> 29:31.544
And what were they saying?

29:31.546 --> 29:32.826
You know, I don't know.

29:32.850 --> 29:35.348
Uh, nonsense, gibberish,
three blind mice.

29:35.350 --> 29:37.217
Three blind mice?

29:37.219 --> 29:39.552
You know, you've spent
the last seven hours telling me

29:39.554 --> 29:41.421
you don't remember anything
about that night.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.683
Well, there you go.

29:45.726 --> 29:47.101
I'm not so sure.

29:47.103 --> 29:48.454
W-What do you mean?

29:48.456 --> 29:51.340
I'm worried the jury looks
at that and thinks,

29:51.342 --> 29:53.059
"He bullied her into it.

29:53.061 --> 29:54.768
"Kept her there for hours.

29:55.277 --> 29:56.636
What's it really prove?"

29:56.638 --> 29:58.772
Well, it proves she's not crazy.

29:58.774 --> 30:00.807
Maybe.

30:01.283 --> 30:02.842
I'm not sure it's enough.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.978
Well, what is it you want
that you don't have?

30:04.980 --> 30:06.880
What a great question.

30:08.150 --> 30:09.756
We don't have a "why."

30:10.598 --> 30:12.519
The jury's gonna be inclined
to think she's crazy

30:12.521 --> 30:16.356
'cause a random killing
is crazy, but a "why,"

30:17.342 --> 30:19.053
a "why" washes all the crazy away.

30:19.055 --> 30:20.627
<i>Why did you shoot</i>

30:20.629 --> 30:22.195
Officer Sampson?

30:22.197 --> 30:24.330
I have no idea.

30:24.915 --> 30:28.531
I wouldn't know him if I fell over him.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.506
Oh, come on. No one's gonna believe that.

30:31.531 --> 30:32.650
It's true.

30:32.652 --> 30:34.363
Do you have 600 grand in the...?

30:34.365 --> 30:36.242
You can't do that.

30:36.244 --> 30:38.324
Can't sneak up on me like
that. I'm a middle-aged man

30:38.348 --> 30:40.123
who's not taking care of himself.

30:40.538 --> 30:41.858
Sorry.

30:41.860 --> 30:44.807
Next time I will call
and announce myself.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.308
What was it you asked me?

30:46.310 --> 30:48.611
Do you have $600,000 in the bank?

30:48.613 --> 30:50.095
'Cause I sure don't.

30:50.097 --> 30:51.647
Don't even have a tenth of that.

30:51.649 --> 30:52.888
Where are you going with this?

30:52.890 --> 30:54.610
You're not gonna ask me
for a loan, are you?

30:54.634 --> 30:56.695
Office Sampson has that much.

30:56.697 --> 30:59.293
He has over half a million
dollars in an offshore account.

31:00.173 --> 31:02.406
Well, maybe he inherited it.

31:02.408 --> 31:04.375
Nope. He grew it.

31:04.377 --> 31:07.912
For the past ten years,
he deposited $5,000 a month,

31:07.914 --> 31:10.381
year in, year out, in cash.

31:10.383 --> 31:12.984
And you and I both know
that no cop in America

31:12.986 --> 31:14.541
makes that much to put away.

31:14.543 --> 31:16.229
Unless he was getting paid off.

31:16.229 --> 31:18.360
Unless he was getting paid off.

31:21.101 --> 31:22.467
Officer Chambers.

31:22.469 --> 31:25.336
Hey. Dr. Jason Bull. Can I have a minute?

31:25.338 --> 31:27.248
You said you're a doctor?

31:27.250 --> 31:29.874
Yes. I'm working with the DA's office.

31:29.876 --> 31:32.110
I'm on your side, which is to say,

31:32.112 --> 31:33.633
I'm on Officer Sampson's side.

31:33.635 --> 31:35.380
I just have a few questions.

31:35.382 --> 31:37.815
I've already gone over my
testimony with ADA Ramsden.

31:37.817 --> 31:39.016
They're waiting for me inside.

31:39.018 --> 31:41.185
I know. Why do you think she did it?

31:41.187 --> 31:42.987
You're his partner.
You must have a theory.

31:43.844 --> 31:45.256
I don't think it was a big mystery.

31:45.258 --> 31:46.958
He was investigating her

31:46.960 --> 31:48.593
for drug trafficking and racketeering.

31:48.595 --> 31:50.361
She was doing business on our beat.

31:50.363 --> 31:51.996
He was getting close.

31:51.998 --> 31:53.531
The man died a hero.

31:53.533 --> 31:55.733
All that crap about her
being crazy is just that.

31:55.735 --> 31:57.372
Yeah. That's my theory, too,

31:57.374 --> 31:59.971
until I found out
he had $600,000 in the bank.

32:01.361 --> 32:04.008
Would you rather have heard
about that on the stand?

32:04.406 --> 32:06.244
Let's have an honest conversation.

32:06.246 --> 32:08.246
Your partner, Sampson, was no detective.

32:08.248 --> 32:09.947
He was a beat cop, just like you.

32:09.949 --> 32:12.116
And I'm sure Hazel
was running her business

32:12.118 --> 32:15.453
right under your noses, just
like dozens of other criminals.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.289
That's not why she killed him,
and you know it.

32:18.291 --> 32:20.425
The only way to put
this woman away for murder

32:20.427 --> 32:22.960
is to prove there was a purpose
for the killing.

32:22.962 --> 32:26.297
My guess is Officer Sampson
was getting paid off

32:26.299 --> 32:28.930
to protect Hazel Diaz's drug ring.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.102
I have to go now.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.038
Were you?

32:34.040 --> 32:36.207
If you're really a good cop,
if you're really clean,

32:36.209 --> 32:38.309
you'll go in there and tell the truth.

32:38.311 --> 32:40.077
If the jury understands...

32:40.079 --> 32:41.446
No one's going to understand.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.015
He was a good cop, too.

32:44.613 --> 32:46.784
He was trying to say
that enough was enough,

32:46.786 --> 32:48.519
that he wasn't gonna
take her money anymore.

32:48.521 --> 32:50.922
That's why she killed him. There.

32:51.286 --> 32:53.191
- You happy now?
- No.

32:53.193 --> 32:55.259
Not until you say it to the jury.

32:55.261 --> 32:56.360
I can't do that.

32:56.362 --> 32:59.030
If you read the papers,
Sampson died a hero.

32:59.032 --> 33:00.865
I can't take that away from his family.

33:00.867 --> 33:02.133
I can't kill him twice

33:02.135 --> 33:05.503
in front of his wife, his kids,
or the brotherhood.

33:05.505 --> 33:07.105
So you're gonna lie to protect his honor,

33:07.129 --> 33:09.729
but you're gonna let his killer walk?

33:09.870 --> 33:11.375
It's ADA Ramsden.

33:11.377 --> 33:12.424
She's looking for me.

33:12.426 --> 33:13.978
Just to be clear,

33:13.980 --> 33:16.514
she's looking for you
to tell the truth in there.

33:19.886 --> 33:23.688
Good talking with you.

33:31.604 --> 33:34.623
How long did your forensic
assessment with Hazel Diaz last?

33:34.683 --> 33:36.116
Eight hours and 12 minutes.

33:36.118 --> 33:37.951
And during this time,
did she say anything

33:37.953 --> 33:39.152
to cause you to doubt

33:39.154 --> 33:41.465
her doctor's diagnosis of schizophrenia?

33:41.780 --> 33:43.426
As a matter of fact, yes.

33:43.428 --> 33:46.539
She insisted it was impossible
for her to remember anything

33:46.541 --> 33:49.362
about the night of the murder
due to her psychotic break,

33:49.402 --> 33:52.150
but later claimed
she remembered hearing voices.

33:52.151 --> 33:53.717
Unfortunately, both of those things

33:53.719 --> 33:54.885
cannot be true.

33:54.887 --> 33:57.421
In fact, they contradict each other.

33:57.423 --> 33:59.056
If it had been a true psychotic break,

33:59.058 --> 34:02.623
she would have had no memory
of the event, period.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.661
Was there anything else
that caught your attention

34:04.663 --> 34:05.796
during the assessment?

34:05.798 --> 34:08.465
Yes. She got very agitated

34:08.467 --> 34:10.500
when I pointed out
this contradiction to her.

34:10.502 --> 34:11.935
And why would that surprise you?

34:11.937 --> 34:14.137
You were, for all intents and purposes,

34:14.139 --> 34:15.472
calling her a liar.

34:15.474 --> 34:18.742
Well, Hazel was supposedly
on anti-psychotic medication.

34:18.744 --> 34:21.411
Though I suspect
she was spitting them out

34:21.413 --> 34:23.373
when the orderlies
weren't looking, and the reason

34:23.397 --> 34:25.449
I say this is, had she
been taking the medication,

34:25.451 --> 34:27.482
and if the dosage had been adequate,

34:27.484 --> 34:30.254
she wouldn't have been capable
of getting that upset.

34:30.255 --> 34:33.306
Those drugs are extremely potent
and heavy sedatives.

34:33.309 --> 34:34.625
So, to summarize...

34:34.627 --> 34:36.326
It is my professional opinion

34:36.328 --> 34:38.295
that Hazel Diaz
has been lying to this court

34:38.297 --> 34:40.063
not only about her mental illness,

34:40.065 --> 34:43.112
but also about her medical treatment.

34:43.588 --> 34:45.601
No further questions, Your Honor.

34:49.092 --> 34:52.995
Dr. Bull, if I told you that Hazel Diaz

34:53.020 --> 34:56.288
has a family history of schizophrenia,

34:56.745 --> 34:58.982
would that change your assessment of her?

34:58.984 --> 35:00.557
Here we go.

35:00.559 --> 35:02.920
I'm aware that Hazel
was raised by her aunt

35:02.922 --> 35:05.055
because her mother was placed
in a mental institution

35:05.057 --> 35:06.657
from the time Hazel was an infant.

35:06.659 --> 35:09.423
I'm also aware her mother
was diagnosed as schizophrenic.

35:09.425 --> 35:11.929
And doesn't this make it more likely

35:11.931 --> 35:13.751
that Hazel Diaz herself

35:13.753 --> 35:15.732
would also have schizophrenia?

35:15.734 --> 35:17.134
Well, it makes it more likely,

35:17.158 --> 35:18.902
but it doesn't change my assessment.

35:18.904 --> 35:22.472
Hazel's mother was diagnosed
with schizophrenia at 22.

35:22.474 --> 35:24.608
Hazel didn't seek treatment
until she was 39.

35:24.610 --> 35:26.276
It's highly unusual

35:26.278 --> 35:27.678
for the first signs of schizophrenia

35:27.702 --> 35:28.812
to manifest themselves

35:28.814 --> 35:31.014
when someone is almost 40 years old.

35:31.016 --> 35:32.950
"Highly unusual"?

35:33.250 --> 35:35.018
Extremely unusual.

35:35.020 --> 35:36.553
But not impossible.

35:39.325 --> 35:41.725
In late-onset schizophrenia,

35:41.727 --> 35:44.414
the symptoms manifest themselves
in a very different manner.

35:44.416 --> 35:46.774
So you admit there is such a thing

35:46.776 --> 35:49.299
as late-onset schizophrenia?

35:49.301 --> 35:51.124
Yes, but I don't think that's what...

35:51.126 --> 35:53.426
Thank you, Dr. Bull. That will be all.

35:53.428 --> 35:55.372
No further questions, Your Honor.

35:55.374 --> 35:58.041
Your Honor,
if I may be heard on redirect?

35:59.611 --> 36:01.278
Can you explain

36:01.280 --> 36:04.646
how late-onset schizophrenia
manifests itself?

36:05.772 --> 36:08.118
Late-onset schizophrenia presents itself

36:08.120 --> 36:10.053
in a much less... aggressive manner.

36:10.055 --> 36:12.289
Late-onset schizophrenics, for example,

36:12.291 --> 36:15.559
require a lower daily dose of
medication, and they do not

36:15.561 --> 36:18.595
act out in a violent manner
towards others.

36:18.597 --> 36:22.432
Does Hazel Diaz exhibit signs
of late-onset schizophrenia?

36:22.434 --> 36:23.999
She does not.

36:24.536 --> 36:25.869
She exhibits signs

36:25.871 --> 36:29.873
of someone who is feigning
early-onset schizophrenia.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.075
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

36:35.781 --> 36:38.015
Well, I think, uh,

36:38.017 --> 36:39.683
you two did what you set out to do.

36:39.685 --> 36:42.392
No, not quite a touchdown.

36:43.155 --> 36:45.437
Afraid it's all up to him now.

36:47.355 --> 36:49.359
<i>Officer Chambers...</i>

36:49.361 --> 36:52.362
on the night of the murder,
you were not in the squad car

36:52.364 --> 36:53.930
with Officer Sampson, were you?

36:53.932 --> 36:55.966
No, I was not.

36:55.968 --> 36:57.067
Can you tell us why?

36:57.574 --> 36:59.792
Officer Sampson sent me to get coffee.

36:59.794 --> 37:01.421
Did he often send you for coffee?

37:01.423 --> 37:03.440
Objection. Relevance?

37:03.442 --> 37:04.808
Sustained.

37:04.810 --> 37:06.843
Miss Ramsden, please get to your point.

37:06.845 --> 37:09.146
Yes, Your Honor. Officer Chambers,

37:09.148 --> 37:11.515
do you think
that Officer Sampson sent you

37:11.517 --> 37:13.757
for coffee because he knew
he was about to have a meeting

37:13.781 --> 37:15.252
with Hazel Diaz, and he didn't want

37:15.254 --> 37:16.686
- to compromise you?
- Objection,

37:16.688 --> 37:18.422
Your Honor, calls for speculation,

37:18.424 --> 37:19.723
and counsel knows it.

37:19.725 --> 37:22.492
She's trying to plant completely
unsupported inferences

37:22.494 --> 37:24.494
- with the jury.
- Miss Ramsden.

37:24.496 --> 37:26.396
You focus your questions properly,

37:26.398 --> 37:28.278
or I'm gonna have them
stricken from the record.

37:28.302 --> 37:29.558
Yes, Your Honor.

37:33.205 --> 37:35.272
Officer Chambers,
did you and your partner

37:35.274 --> 37:36.773
ever discuss money?

37:37.572 --> 37:38.875
How do you mean?

37:38.877 --> 37:40.877
Mm, personal finances.

37:40.879 --> 37:43.246
Yes, of course. From time to time.

37:43.248 --> 37:44.714
Did he ever share with you

37:44.716 --> 37:46.016
that he had an offshore account

37:46.018 --> 37:48.251
with about $600,000 in it?

37:53.959 --> 37:56.760
I don't think he ever shared
the specific amount.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.593
Hmm.

38:00.465 --> 38:02.398
I'd like to offer into evidence

38:02.423 --> 38:05.824
the ten years and four months
of monthly cash deposits

38:05.849 --> 38:08.850
equaling $620,000.

38:11.610 --> 38:13.710
Do you have any idea
where all of this money

38:13.712 --> 38:15.819
might have come from, Officer Chambers?

38:22.701 --> 38:24.588
He told me it came from Hazel Diaz.

38:27.059 --> 38:28.291
Hazel Diaz?

38:28.293 --> 38:30.155
I don't believe this.

38:30.180 --> 38:32.229
This Hazel Diaz?

38:32.231 --> 38:34.431
Who claims to not know the victim?

38:34.433 --> 38:36.066
Who claims to have been in the midst

38:36.068 --> 38:38.268
of a psychotic break
at the time of the shooting?

38:38.270 --> 38:39.676
Yes.

38:40.339 --> 38:43.573
He told me he received
$5,000 cash every month

38:43.575 --> 38:45.675
to do bag drops and provide protection

38:45.677 --> 38:47.544
for Hazel Diaz's drug business.

38:51.917 --> 38:55.051
When Officer Sampson sent you for coffee,

38:55.053 --> 38:57.400
did you have a sense
that something was gonna happen?

38:57.402 --> 38:59.890
No. I mean, not really.

38:59.892 --> 39:02.392
I mean, I knew that he was
probably gonna meet with Hazel,

39:02.394 --> 39:04.691
but I obviously had no idea
that she was gonna kill him.

39:04.693 --> 39:07.264
And was there anything different
about Officer Sampson

39:07.266 --> 39:09.833
on that specific night
or leading up to that night?

39:09.835 --> 39:11.166
Yes.

39:12.304 --> 39:14.502
Just that he told me that he wished...

39:16.004 --> 39:17.922
that he could put a stop to it.

39:18.243 --> 39:19.910
He felt like he was too deep in,

39:19.912 --> 39:21.426
and he didn't know how to get out.

39:21.914 --> 39:24.548
He was worried
that his family would find out.

39:24.550 --> 39:28.016
His boys and his wife.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.719
He was even contemplating

39:29.721 --> 39:31.281
turning in the accused, which would mean

39:31.305 --> 39:32.978
turning himself in.

39:34.647 --> 39:36.649
You know, good people make mistakes.

39:37.196 --> 39:38.777
He was a good person...

39:40.028 --> 39:42.155
just trying to undo a mistake.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.334
Thank you, Officer Chambers.

39:46.338 --> 39:48.091
They're coming

39:48.093 --> 39:49.249
for me!

39:49.251 --> 39:50.774
They're all lying,

39:50.776 --> 39:53.155
and they're coming for me!

39:53.157 --> 39:54.597
Make them go away!

39:54.622 --> 39:56.263
Tell them to go away!

39:56.265 --> 39:58.905
- No! No! I told them I didn't do it!
- Call the paramedics.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.950
Clear the jury.

39:59.952 --> 40:01.184
That I was with you!

40:01.186 --> 40:03.186
- I'll see if I can find the paramedics.
- Officer.

40:03.210 --> 40:03.987
Clear the jury.

40:03.989 --> 40:05.255
Get off me!

40:05.257 --> 40:09.226
- They don't believe me!
- If the jury will please

40:09.228 --> 40:10.668
make their way back to the jury room.

40:12.929 --> 40:15.298
I told them I was with you.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.766
I told them I was with all of you.

40:16.768 --> 40:18.278
I got her. You know I didn't

40:18.280 --> 40:19.295
because I wouldn't do anything

40:19.319 --> 40:20.370
like that. Just hold her still.

40:20.372 --> 40:21.972
- Get her a Zophramine shot.
- They're lying.

40:21.974 --> 40:23.540
It's the only thing
that's gonna sedate her.

40:23.542 --> 40:25.108
No, no, no, you have to take her
to the hospital first.

40:25.110 --> 40:26.810
With all due respect, she is clearly

40:26.812 --> 40:28.812
- a danger to herself and others.
- I know. I know.

40:28.836 --> 40:29.833
- No.
- Look at her.

40:29.835 --> 40:32.215
I promise you, this will calm her down.

40:32.217 --> 40:33.717
Of course, if she isn't really sick,

40:33.719 --> 40:36.553
it will almost certainly
bring on seizures.

40:40.759 --> 40:42.025
No!

40:42.027 --> 40:44.527
No. No.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.663
No.

40:46.665 --> 40:48.265
Get off me.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.902
I'm fine.

40:53.505 --> 40:55.272
I'm fine.

40:59.578 --> 41:01.244
Ms. Ramsden, Dr. Bull.

41:01.246 --> 41:03.146
My client was wondering
if there were any way

41:03.148 --> 41:04.781
she could speak with you both.

41:06.251 --> 41:07.417
Why are we here?

41:07.419 --> 41:09.085
Hazel is interested

41:09.087 --> 41:10.420
in a plea deal.

41:10.422 --> 41:12.422
- But we're not.
- She is offering

41:12.424 --> 41:15.225
20 years in a mental institution
of her choosing,

41:15.227 --> 41:16.493
and in return,

41:16.495 --> 41:17.789
she will give information

41:17.791 --> 41:20.795
on the top three
drug cartel leaders in New York.

41:26.134 --> 41:27.937
Can you give us a minute?

41:33.745 --> 41:35.585
I'm sure I'm telling you
what you already know,

41:35.587 --> 41:36.732
but take this to a verdict.

41:36.734 --> 41:38.447
You have her, and she knows it.

41:38.449 --> 41:40.481
Otherwise, she wouldn't
be offering a plea deal.

41:40.483 --> 41:41.918
And what's in it for me?

41:42.567 --> 41:44.387
Another breakfast.

41:54.309 --> 41:56.569
We the jury find the defendant,

41:56.571 --> 41:57.957
Hazel Diaz...

41:59.292 --> 42:01.971
guilty of murder in the first degree.

42:01.973 --> 42:03.940
Oh! Yes!

42:21.792 --> 42:22.818
Hey.

42:23.445 --> 42:26.563
Hey. I've been waiting
for you, counselor.

42:26.565 --> 42:28.298
Congratulations on your victory.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.967
Thanks. Couldn't have done it
without you.

42:30.969 --> 42:33.436
Well, my pleasure. There's no one

42:33.438 --> 42:34.738
in the district attorney's office

42:34.740 --> 42:36.940
I'd rather get up
in the middle of the night for.

42:37.914 --> 42:39.642
How long you been waiting to say that?

42:39.644 --> 42:41.811
Uh, awhile.

42:41.813 --> 42:43.893
You know, you come up with
these things in your head,

42:43.917 --> 42:45.582
and then it's just a matter of timing.

42:45.584 --> 42:48.551
Patience. Waiting for the perfect moment.

42:50.222 --> 42:51.855
Don't I owe you breakfast?

42:51.857 --> 42:54.257
You've been waiting
to say that, too, huh?

42:54.259 --> 42:55.859
Guilty.

42:55.861 --> 42:57.827
Can I buy you dinner?

42:59.564 --> 43:01.765
Okay, that one was spontaneous, I swear.

43:01.767 --> 43:03.218
I don't believe you.

43:03.220 --> 43:05.702
- So that's a no?
- No.

43:05.704 --> 43:06.970
Is that a yes?

43:07.652 --> 43:09.577
- Yes.
- How long you been waiting to do that?
