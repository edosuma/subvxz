00:54.419 --> 00:58.122
<i>This is a story about a man</i>
<i>named Harold Crick.</i>

00:58.122 --> 01:00.352
<i>And his wristwatch.</i>

01:00.925 --> 01:03.828
<i>Harold Crick was a man of infinite</i>
<i>numbers…</i>

01:03.828 --> 01:07.699
<i>…endless calculations</i>
<i>and remarkably few words.</i>

01:07.699 --> 01:10.566
<i>And his wristwatch said even less.</i>

01:12.303 --> 01:15.136
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

01:15.340 --> 01:20.778
<i>…Harold would brush</i>
<i>each of his 32 teeth 76 times.</i>

01:22.380 --> 01:25.086
<i>Thirty-eight times back and forth.</i>

01:25.450 --> 01:27.958
<i>Thirty-eight times up and down.</i>

01:29.254 --> 01:31.848
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

01:32.056 --> 01:36.327
<i>…Harold would tie his tie in a single</i>
<i>Windsor knot instead of the double…</i>

01:36.327 --> 01:39.353
<i>…thereby saving up to 43 seconds.</i>

01:39.564 --> 01:44.866
<i>His wristwatch thought the single</i>
<i>Windsor made his neck look fat…</i>

01:45.069 --> 01:46.719
<i>…but said nothing.</i>

01:50.141 --> 01:52.451
<i>Every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

01:52.577 --> 01:57.415
<i>…Harold would run at a rate of nearly</i>
<i>57 steps per block for six blocks…</i>

01:57.415 --> 02:00.979
<i>…barely catching</i>
<i>the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

02:01.386 --> 02:03.221
<i>His wristwatch would delight…</i>

02:03.221 --> 02:07.841
<i>…in the feeling of the crisp wind</i>
<i>rushing over its face.</i>

02:15.800 --> 02:17.936
<i>And every weekday, for 12 years…</i>

02:17.936 --> 02:21.303
<i>…Harold would review 7.134</i>
<i>tax files…</i>

02:21.506 --> 02:25.862
<i>…as a senior agent</i>
<i>for the Internal Revenue Service.</i>

02:25.910 --> 02:29.539
Regs section 1.469-2 (B) (i), Diane.
Thanks.

02:29.747 --> 02:32.113
Good morning. IRS.

02:33.117 --> 02:35.881
Harold, 89 times 1417?

02:36.621 --> 02:38.748
126,113.

02:38.957 --> 02:39.924
That adds up.

02:40.391 --> 02:44.623
<i>Only taking a 45.7-minute</i>
<i>lunch break…</i>

02:45.730 --> 02:49.029
<i>…and a 4.3-minute coffee break…</i>

02:49.233 --> 02:52.327
<i>…timed precisely by his wristwatch.</i>

02:52.804 --> 02:53.930
Oh, great.

02:54.138 --> 02:56.514
Yeah, we'll go to Mullen's or we'II…

02:57.075 --> 03:01.171
<i>Beyond that,</i>
<i>Harold lived a life of solitude.</i>

03:02.180 --> 03:04.444
<i>He would walk home alone.</i>

03:06.351 --> 03:08.785
<i>He would eat alone.</i>

03:16.260 --> 03:20.162
<i>And at precisely 11:13 every night…</i>

03:20.365 --> 03:23.129
<i>…Harold would go to bed alone…</i>

03:23.334 --> 03:28.284
<i>…placing his wristwatch to rest</i>
<i>on the nightstand beside him.</i>

03:29.273 --> 03:33.300
<i>That was, of course,</i>
<i>before Wednesday.</i>

03:34.946 --> 03:40.145
O <i>n Wednesday, Harold's wristwatch</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

03:46.691 --> 03:48.318
Oh, my God, you got it?

03:48.526 --> 03:49.652
I got it.

03:50.194 --> 03:51.559
I got it.

04:04.275 --> 04:06.944
<i>If one had asked Harold,</i>
<i>he would have said…</i>

04:06.944 --> 04:11.949
<i>…that this particular Wednesday was</i>
<i>exactly like all the Wednesdays prior.</i>

04:11.949 --> 04:14.523
<i>And he began it the same way he…</i>

04:24.862 --> 04:28.624
<i>And he began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

04:31.335 --> 04:32.427
Hello?

04:42.113 --> 04:45.516
<i>He began it the same way</i>
<i>he always did.</i>

04:45.516 --> 04:47.351
<i>When others' minds would…</i>

04:47.351 --> 04:48.935
Hello? Is someone there?

04:56.027 --> 04:59.897
<i>When others' minds would fantasize</i>
<i>about their upcoming day…</i>

04:59.897 --> 05:04.202
<i>…or even try to grip onto</i>
<i>the final moments of their dreams…</i>

05:04.202 --> 05:08.036
<i>…Harold just counted brushstrokes.</i>

05:09.874 --> 05:13.211
All right, who just said,
“Harold just counted brushstrokes”?

05:13.211 --> 05:16.180
And how do you know I'm counting
brushstrokes?

05:16.180 --> 05:17.579
Hello?

05:20.184 --> 05:23.984
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest…</i>

05:26.557 --> 05:28.616
<i>It was remarkable h…</i>

05:32.563 --> 05:37.268
<i>It was remarkable how the simple,</i>
<i>modest elements of Harold's life…</i>

05:37.268 --> 05:39.578
<i>…so often taken for granted…</i>

05:39.637 --> 05:45.041
<i>…would become the catalyst</i>
<i>for an entirely new life.</i>

05:46.144 --> 05:48.012
<i>Harold ran for the bus…</i>

05:48.012 --> 05:51.516
<i>…his stiff leather shoes</i>
<i>making a terrible squeaking sound…</i>

05:51.516 --> 05:54.354
<i>…as they flexed against the asphalt.</i>

05:59.657 --> 06:03.287
<i>And though this was</i>
<i>an extraordinary day…</i>

06:03.427 --> 06:07.465
<i>…a day to be remembered</i>
<i>for the rest of Harold's life…</i>

06:07.465 --> 06:11.029
<i>…Harold just thought</i>
<i>it was a Wednesday.</i>

06:11.102 --> 06:13.016
I'm sorry, did you hear that?

06:13.971 --> 06:17.608
The voice. Did you hear it?
“Harold thought it was a Wednesday”?

06:17.608 --> 06:19.522
Don't worry, it is Wednesday.

06:19.911 --> 06:24.267
No, no, did you hear it? “Harold
just thought it was a Wednesday”?

06:24.515 --> 06:27.143
–Who's Harold?
–I'm Harold.

06:27.752 --> 06:29.996
Harold, it's okay, it's Wednesday.

06:30.154 --> 06:31.621
No, no, I…

06:32.190 --> 06:33.782
Never mind.

06:35.359 --> 06:37.995
<i>Harold couldn't concentrate</i>
<i>on his work.</i>

06:37.995 --> 06:39.163
Excuse me, Harold?

06:39.163 --> 06:42.300
<i>His thoughts were scattered.</i>
<i>His mind elsewhere.</i>

06:42.300 --> 06:43.631
Sorry.

06:44.035 --> 06:46.871
Someone here should be able to fix…
Hold on a second.

06:46.871 --> 06:50.136
Hey, Harold. What's 67 times 453?

06:50.341 --> 06:54.345
<i>When a coworker asked</i>
<i>the product of 67 and 453…</i>

06:54.345 --> 06:56.747
You know what?
I can't think while you're talking.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.331
<i>…he drew a blank.</i>

06:58.449 --> 06:59.416
–What?
–What?

06:59.650 --> 07:03.955
<i>–Harold quickly answered, “30,351.”</i>
–What? Oh, nothing. 30,351.

07:03.955 --> 07:07.453
<i>Despite the answer</i>
<i>really being 31,305.</i>

07:07.458 --> 07:12.054
Wait, wait, wait, 31,305. Sorry.

07:14.799 --> 07:18.231
Dude, I just totally caught
some insurance adjuster…

07:18.302 --> 07:20.964
…claiming his jet ski
as a work vehicle.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.409
I'll tell you, it is a shame…

07:24.409 --> 07:28.039
…that they don't give out
an auditor of the year award.

07:29.648 --> 07:30.979
Dude?

07:31.917 --> 07:33.316
You okay?

07:34.453 --> 07:36.546
Dave, I'm being followed.

07:41.326 --> 07:44.062
How are you being followed?
You're not moving.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.860
–It's by a voice.
–What?

07:47.065 --> 07:49.863
I'm being followed
by a woman's voice.

07:52.871 --> 07:54.338
Okay.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.039
What is she saying?

07:58.744 --> 08:00.712
She's narrating.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.553
Harold, you're staring at boxes,
what is she narrating?

08:08.553 --> 08:10.851
No, no, no. I had to stop filing.

08:11.056 --> 08:12.970
Watch. Watch. Listen. Listen.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.562
<i>The sound the paper made</i>
<i>against the folder…</i>

08:17.562 --> 08:21.852
<i>…had the same tone</i>
<i>as a wave scraping against sand.</i>

08:23.101 --> 08:24.903
<i>And when Harold thought about it…</i>

08:24.903 --> 08:27.339
<i>…he listened to enough waves</i>
<i>every day…</i>

08:27.339 --> 08:32.421
<i>…to constitute what he imagined</i>
<i>to be a deep and endless ocean.</i>

08:33.544 --> 08:34.943
Did you hear that?

08:35.147 --> 08:36.546
You mean you filing?

08:36.748 --> 08:38.340
No, no, no, the voice.

08:39.451 --> 08:40.679
No.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.608
Frightening part is sometimes I do
imagine a deep and endless ocean.

08:47.559 --> 08:48.856
What ocean?

08:49.061 --> 08:52.053
The one made by the sound…
Forget it.

08:52.264 --> 08:54.232
New audits. Have a good day.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.730
Thank you.

08:58.070 --> 09:03.531
All right, we got a baker
and a securities trader.

09:07.646 --> 09:09.758
Maybe you should take the baker.

09:10.315 --> 09:11.577
–Okay?
–Okay.

09:19.891 --> 09:22.416
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

09:22.627 --> 09:25.653
–You miscreant.
–I understand.

09:26.164 --> 09:30.294
Oh, get bent, taxman!

09:30.502 --> 09:32.561
–Taxman!
–Taxman!

09:33.772 --> 09:35.603
Taxman!

09:37.809 --> 09:39.276
Go home!

09:39.478 --> 09:43.240
Listen, is there somewhere else
we could talk about this?

09:43.515 --> 09:48.145
No. We're gonna talk about this
right here.

09:48.520 --> 09:53.981
Okay. It says, the file, that you only
paid part of your taxes for last year.

09:54.192 --> 09:57.252
–That's right.
–Looks like only 78 percent.

09:57.462 --> 09:59.123
Yep.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.700
So you did it on purpose?

10:01.700 --> 10:02.962
Yep.

10:03.168 --> 10:05.874
So you must have been
expecting an audit?

10:07.172 --> 10:10.767
I was expecting a fine…

10:11.676 --> 10:14.543
…or a sharp reprimand.

10:15.046 --> 10:18.049
A reprimand? This isn't
boarding school, Ms Pascal.

10:18.049 --> 10:20.029
You stole from the government.

10:20.452 --> 10:25.754
No, I didn't steal from the government.
I just didn't pay you entirely.

10:25.957 --> 10:28.927
Ms Pascal, you can't just
not pay your taxes.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.626
Yes, I can.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.899
You can if you wanna get audited.

10:33.899 --> 10:37.397
Only if I recognize your right
to audit me, Mr Crick.

10:37.936 --> 10:40.510
Ms Pascal, I'm right here
auditing you.

10:40.772 --> 10:42.974
Now I have to go over
your past three years…

10:42.974 --> 10:45.343
…to make sure
that's all you haven't paid.

10:45.343 --> 10:46.503
Fine.

10:47.879 --> 10:50.905
Actually, you know, it's not fine.

10:51.116 --> 10:55.018
Listen, I'm a big supporter
of fixing potholes…

10:55.220 --> 10:58.553
…and erecting swing sets
and building shelters.

10:58.757 --> 11:01.988
I am more than happy
to pay those taxes.

11:02.794 --> 11:06.628
I'm just not such a big fan
of the percentage…

11:06.832 --> 11:10.427
…that the government uses
for national defense…

11:10.635 --> 11:14.196
…corporate bailouts
and campaign discretionary funds.

11:14.406 --> 11:17.933
So I didn't pay those taxes.

11:18.143 --> 11:19.770
I think, actually…

11:19.978 --> 11:23.675
…I sent a letter to that effect
with my return.

11:24.149 --> 11:28.175
Would it be the letter that begins,
“Dear Imperialist Swine”?

11:28.253 --> 11:29.481
Yes.

11:30.489 --> 11:35.188
Ms Pascal, what you're describing
is anarchy. Are you an anarchist?

11:36.161 --> 11:40.791
–You mean am I a member of…?
–An anarchist group, yes.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.130
Anarchists have a group?

11:44.336 --> 11:45.769
I believe so. Sure.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.466
They assemble?

11:49.174 --> 11:50.971
I don't know.

11:51.843 --> 11:55.711
Wouldn't that completely
defeat the purpose?

11:56.114 --> 12:00.418
<i>It was difficult for Harold to imagine</i>
<i>Ms Pascal as a revolutionary.</i>

12:00.418 --> 12:01.853
–Not now.
<i>–Her thin arms…</i>

12:01.853 --> 12:04.089
–What?
<i>…hoisting protest signs.</i>

12:04.089 --> 12:05.824
<i>–Her long shapely legs…</i>
–Nothing.

12:05.824 --> 12:08.452
<i>…dashing from tear gas.</i>

12:08.760 --> 12:11.263
<i>Harold wasn't prone to fantasies…</i>

12:11.263 --> 12:15.421
<i>…and so he tried his best</i>
<i>to remain professional.</i>

12:15.567 --> 12:17.547
<i>But, of course, failed.</i>

12:17.903 --> 12:21.306
<i>He couldn't help but imagine</i>
<i>Ms Pascal…</i>

12:21.306 --> 12:26.520
<i>…stroking the side of his face</i>
<i>with the soft blade of her finger.</i>

12:26.678 --> 12:30.315
<i>He couldn't help but imagine her</i>
<i>immersed in a tub…</i>

12:30.315 --> 12:32.715
<i>…shaving her legs.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:36.680
<i>And he couldn't help</i>
<i>but imagine her naked…</i>

12:36.788 --> 12:39.692
<i>…stretched across his bed.</i>
–Mr Crick?

12:41.860 --> 12:44.761
–Mr Crick.
–Yes, what is it?

12:44.963 --> 12:47.659
You're staring at my tits.

12:49.467 --> 12:53.138
I wa…? I don't think I was.
I don't think I would do that.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.920
If I was, I can assure you…

12:54.973 --> 12:58.910
…it was only as a representative
of the United States government.

12:58.910 --> 13:04.678
Sorry, I'm just having issues today.
So I'll be back on Tuesday.

13:07.419 --> 13:11.890
<i>Harold suddenly found himself</i>
<i>beleaguered and exasperated…</i>

13:11.890 --> 13:14.332
<i>…outside the bakery…</i>
–Shut up!

13:14.492 --> 13:16.661
<i>…cursing the heavens in futility.</i>

13:16.661 --> 13:19.097
No, I'm not, I'm cursing you,
you stupid voice!

13:19.097 --> 13:22.032
So shut up and leave me alone!

13:48.793 --> 13:50.988
Hey, watch it!

14:19.759 --> 14:21.317
<i>Excuse me.</i>

14:23.062 --> 14:24.996
Excuse me.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.833
Are you Miss Eiffel?

14:33.439 --> 14:34.561
–Yes.
–Excellent.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.588
May I ask what you're doing?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.367
Research.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.492
–Oh, am I interrupting?
–Yes.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.548
I'm sorry. I'm Penny Escher.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.390
I'm the assistant
your publishers hired.

14:47.753 --> 14:50.916
–The spy.
–The assistant.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.961
I provide the same services
as a secretary.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.789
I don't need a secretary.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.765
Then I will have to find some
other way of occupying my time.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.600
Like watching me like a vulture…

15:01.600 --> 15:05.271
…because the publishers
think I have writer's block, right?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.136
Do you have writer's block?

15:10.776 --> 15:12.243
Are these pages?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.913
They're letters. To me.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.980
–Are you writing back?
–I don't respond to letters.

15:19.151 --> 15:22.187
And I suppose you smoked
all these cigarettes?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.518
No, they came pre-smoked.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.458
Yeah, they said you were funny.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.566
What do you think about
leaping off a building?

15:35.234 --> 15:37.236
I don't think about
leaping off buildings.

15:37.236 --> 15:40.239
–Yes, you do.
–No. I try to think of nice things.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.374
Everyone thinks about
leaping off buildings.

15:42.374 --> 15:46.466
Well, I certainly don't think about
leaping off of a building.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.982
They say…

16:00.292 --> 16:03.592
I read this in this
fantastically depressing book.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.855
–That when you jump
from a building…

16:07.066 --> 16:10.399
…it's rarely the impact
that actually kills you.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.963
Well, I'm sure it doesn't help.

16:13.339 --> 16:17.332
There's a photograph
in the book called <i>The Leaper.</i>

16:17.543 --> 16:19.457
It's old, but it's beautiful.

16:19.979 --> 16:24.016
From above the corpse of a woman
who'd just leapt to her death.

16:24.016 --> 16:28.009
There's blood around her head,
like a halo…

16:28.220 --> 16:32.510
…and her leg's buckled underneath,
her arm's snapped like a twig…

16:32.758 --> 16:35.249
…but her face is so serene…

16:35.795 --> 16:37.854
…so at peace.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.466
And I think it's because
when she died…

16:40.466 --> 16:43.867
…she could feel the wind
against her face.

16:49.208 --> 16:53.440
I don't know how to kill Harold Crick.
That's why they sent you.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.981
Yes, to help you.

16:57.216 --> 16:58.884
How are you gonna help me?

16:58.884 --> 17:01.220
You, who never thinks
of leaping off buildings?

17:01.220 --> 17:04.022
What great inspiration
will you bestow on me?

17:04.022 --> 17:06.525
I'll tell you, the quaint ideas
you've gathered…

17:06.525 --> 17:08.761
…in your adorable career
as an “assistant”…

17:08.761 --> 17:11.863
…are to no avail
when faced with killing a man.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.060
I understand.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.096
Do you? I can't just…

17:24.009 --> 17:25.511
As much as I would like to…

17:25.511 --> 17:29.242
…I cannot simply throw
Harold Crick off a building.

17:35.921 --> 17:41.154
Miss Eiffel. Kay. I've been
an author's assistant for 11 years.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.330
I've helped more than 20 authors
complete more than 35 books…

17:44.330 --> 17:46.599
…and I've never missed the deadline.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.802
And I have never gone back to the
publisher to ask for more time.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.439
Now, I will be available to you
every minute of every day…

17:53.439 --> 17:57.276
…until the final punctuation
is embedded on the very last page.

17:57.276 --> 18:01.645
I do not like loud music.
I do not abide narcotics.

18:01.947 --> 18:07.146
And I will gladly and quietly
help you kill Harold Crick.

18:16.061 --> 18:20.483
I had a very interesting little convo
with someone in your section.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.827
Yeah?

18:23.202 --> 18:26.502
They said you were feeling
a little wibbly-wobbly.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.167
Catch a little cubicle fever?

18:31.710 --> 18:34.020
Oh, I don't know. I think I'm okay.

18:34.413 --> 18:39.646
Harold, a tree doesn't think
it's a tree…

18:39.985 --> 18:42.044
…it is a tree.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.352
<i>Why was Harold talking to this man?</i>

18:45.858 --> 18:48.326
<i>This man was an idiot.</i>

18:48.527 --> 18:54.022
<i>This man used words like</i>
<i>“wibbly-wobbly” and “convo.”</i>

18:54.500 --> 18:57.628
<i>And explained that trees were trees.</i>

18:58.170 --> 19:00.105
O <i>f course trees were trees.</i>

19:00.105 --> 19:02.041
<i>Harold knew trees were trees.</i>

19:02.041 --> 19:03.876
I am going to believe you, Harold.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.512
<i>What Harold didn't know</i>
<i>was why he couldn't shake…</i>

19:06.512 --> 19:09.281
<i>…the smell of brownies</i>
<i>from his senses.</i>

19:09.281 --> 19:14.297
<i>Why Ms Pascal had made</i>
<i>his fingertips quiver and lips go numb.</i>

19:15.254 --> 19:16.619
Harold?

19:19.024 --> 19:21.151
Yes? Sorry.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.921
What's going on, Harold?

19:25.431 --> 19:26.693
Well…

19:29.101 --> 19:32.229
Nothing. Everything's fine.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.475
Listen, according to your records…

19:37.676 --> 19:42.340
…you haven't taken vacation
in a few years now.

19:42.548 --> 19:45.676
Let's say you take a little break.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.651
Use some of that vaca time.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.622
Yeah. I'll think about it.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.328
Harold.

20:01.266 --> 20:06.067
I'm not really supposed to do this,
but…

20:25.358 --> 20:28.094
<i>Harold assumed his watch</i>
<i>was simply on the fritz…</i>

20:28.094 --> 20:33.836
<i>…and never even considered that it</i>
<i>might be trying to tell him something.</i>

20:34.834 --> 20:38.104
<i>In fact, Harold had never once</i>
<i>paid attention to his watch…</i>

20:38.104 --> 20:40.173
<i>…other than to find out the time.</i>

20:40.173 --> 20:44.439
<i>And, honestly,</i>
<i>it drove his watch crazy.</i>

20:44.844 --> 20:47.447
<i>And so, on this particular</i>
<i>Wednesday evening…</i>

20:47.447 --> 20:51.651
<i>…as Harold waited for the bus,</i>
<i>his watch suddenly…</i>

20:51.651 --> 20:53.516
<i>…stopped.</i>

20:55.255 --> 20:57.433
Sorry, does anyone have the time?

20:57.957 --> 21:01.188
–Yeah, I got 6:18.
–Thanks.

21:01.394 --> 21:07.492
<i>Thus Harold's watch thrust him</i>
<i>into the immitigable path of fate.</i>

21:07.700 --> 21:12.172
<i>Little did he know that this simple,</i>
<i>seemingly innocuous act…</i>

21:12.172 --> 21:15.010
<i>…would result in his imminent death.</i>

21:15.308 --> 21:17.435
What? What?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.635
Hey! Hello?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.512
What?

21:22.215 --> 21:23.477
Why?

21:24.217 --> 21:25.878
Why my death?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.518
Hello!

21:28.154 --> 21:30.213
Excuse me!

21:30.690 --> 21:32.385
When?

21:33.093 --> 21:35.084
How imminent?

21:36.029 --> 21:37.621
Okay, where are you?

21:45.004 --> 21:49.168
“Harold would brush his 32 teeth
72 times.”

21:49.676 --> 21:53.237
Why won't you say anything?
I heard you.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.652
“That would result
in his imminent death.”

21:56.683 --> 21:58.480
I heard you!

21:59.185 --> 22:00.901
Come on, you stupid voice.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.580
“Harold frantically grabbed his lamp.

22:04.557 --> 22:09.017
Harold, incensed, shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason!

22:09.229 --> 22:12.892
And smashed it on the ground,
kicking it repeatedly!

22:14.634 --> 22:17.704
Harold took his Kleenex box,
threw it across the room…

22:17.704 --> 22:19.420
…then stormed the closet!”

22:22.041 --> 22:24.100
Come on. Say something.

22:26.312 --> 22:28.872
Something. Say something!

22:30.116 --> 22:32.107
Say something!

22:39.058 --> 22:41.891
“Harold, distraught…”

22:43.796 --> 22:45.286
God.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.858
”Harold, distraught…"

22:50.937 --> 22:52.461
“Harold…”

22:56.609 --> 23:00.899
<i>I'm afraid what you're describing</i>
<i>is schizophrenia.</i>

23:03.249 --> 23:08.551
No. No. It's not schizophrenia.
It's just a voice in my head.

23:08.755 --> 23:12.418
I mean, the voice isn't telling me
to do anything.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.199
It's telling me what I've already done.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.328
Accurately
and with a better vocabulary.

23:19.199 --> 23:22.134
Mr Crick, you have a voice
speaking to you.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.730
No, not to me, about me.

23:26.206 --> 23:31.143
I'm somehow involved
in some sort of story.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.104
Like I'm a character in my own life.

23:34.647 --> 23:38.447
But the problem is
that the voice comes and goes.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.088
Like there are other parts of the story
not being told to me…

23:42.088 --> 23:46.125
…and I need to find out what those
other parts are before it's too late.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.963
Before the story concludes
with your death.

23:49.062 --> 23:50.427
Yes.

23:51.231 --> 23:53.900
Mr Crick, I hate to sound
like a broken record…

23:53.900 --> 23:56.198
…but that's schizophrenia.

23:57.604 --> 24:02.234
You don't sound like a broken record,
but it's just not schizophrenia.

24:03.309 --> 24:06.142
What if what I said was true?

24:06.346 --> 24:11.613
Hypothetically speaking,
if I was part of a story, a narrative…

24:11.818 --> 24:15.686
…even if it was only in my mind…

24:16.022 --> 24:18.266
…what would you suggest that I do?

24:18.558 --> 24:21.660
I would suggest
you take prescribed medication.

24:22.996 --> 24:24.623
Other than that.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.731
I don't know.

24:27.367 --> 24:31.921
I suppose I would send you to see
someone who knows about literature.

24:33.740 --> 24:34.934
Okay.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.902
Yeah. That's a good idea.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.341
Thank you.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.784
So you're the gentleman
who called me about the narrator.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.622
–Yes.
–This narrator says you're gonna die.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.780
Yes.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.446
–How long has it given you to live?
–I don't know.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.990
Dramatic irony.
It'll fuck you every time.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.987
–So you crazy or what?
–Well…

24:59.198 --> 25:01.434
Are you allowed to say that
to crazy people?

25:01.434 --> 25:03.770
–I don't know.
–Oh, well. How many stairs…

25:03.770 --> 25:06.068
…in the hallway out there?
–What?

25:06.272 --> 25:08.741
You were counting them
as we walked, weren't you?

25:08.741 --> 25:09.935
No.

25:10.143 --> 25:12.045
Of course.
What bank do you work at?

25:12.045 --> 25:14.206
No bank. IRS agent.

25:14.847 --> 25:15.939
–Married?
–No.

25:16.149 --> 25:17.173
Ever?

25:17.383 --> 25:20.520
Engaged to an auditor.
She left me for an actuary.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.286
–How heartbreaking. Live alone?
–Yes.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.890
–Any pets?
–No.

25:29.262 --> 25:33.130
–Friends?
–No. Well, Dave at work.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.737
I see. The narrator,
exactly what does he sound like?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.068
It's a woman.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.603
A woman.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.935
–Is it a familiar woman?
–No.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.838
Someone you know?

25:46.713 --> 25:47.907
No.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.317
Did you have enough time
to count the tiles in the bathroom?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.285
I wasn't counting the tiles.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.484
–Coffee?
–No, thank you.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.156
–Sure?
–Yes.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.994
So this woman, the voice,
told you you're gonna die?

26:01.994 --> 26:04.430
She didn't tell me.
She doesn't know I can hear her.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.227
–But she said it.
–Yes.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.818
And you believed her.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.503
She's been right
about a few other things.

26:10.503 --> 26:14.064
–Such as?
–How I felt about work.

26:14.273 --> 26:16.741
–You dislike your work?
–Yes.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.214
Well, not the most insightful voice
in the world, is it?

26:21.214 --> 26:23.683
First thing on a list
of what Americans hate: Work.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.552
Second, traffic. Third, missing socks.
See what I'm saying?

26:26.552 --> 26:27.519
Sort of.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.922
I told you you were gonna die,
you believe me?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.253
–No.
–Why?

26:31.457 --> 26:32.822
I don't know you.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.731
–But you don't know this narrator.
–Well…

26:36.362 --> 26:40.924
–Okay, Mr Crick, I can't help you.
–Why?

26:41.134 --> 26:44.404
Well, I'm not an expert in crazy,
I'm an expert in literature theory.

26:44.404 --> 26:46.838
And I gotta tell you, thus far…

26:47.039 --> 26:50.143
…there doesn't seem to be a single
literary thing about you.

26:50.143 --> 26:53.646
I don't doubt you hear a voice,
but it couldn't possibly be a narrator…

26:53.646 --> 26:56.884
…because, frankly, there doesn't seem
to be much to narrate.

26:56.884 --> 26:59.520
Beside that, this semester
I'm teaching five courses.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.422
I'm mentoring
two doctoral candidates…

27:01.422 --> 27:04.260
…and I'm the faculty lifeguard
at the pool.

27:05.726 --> 27:09.463
–I just thought you could possibly…
–Perhaps you should keep a journal.

27:09.463 --> 27:11.632
Write down what she said
or something.

27:11.632 --> 27:14.362
That's all I can suggest.

27:16.370 --> 27:19.173
I can barely remember it all.
I just remember:

27:19.173 --> 27:23.667
“Little did he know that this simple,
seemingly innocuous act…

27:23.877 --> 27:26.345
…would lead to his imminent death.”

27:26.547 --> 27:29.414
–What?
–“Little did he know that this…”

27:29.616 --> 27:32.380
–Did you say, “little did he know”?
–Yes.

27:33.854 --> 27:36.758
I've written papers
on “little did he know.”

27:37.291 --> 27:40.855
I used to teach a class
based on “little did he know.”

27:41.795 --> 27:45.666
I mean, I once gave an entire seminar
on “little did he know.”

27:45.666 --> 27:47.497
Son of a bitch, Harold.

27:48.535 --> 27:51.572
“Little did he know” means there's
something he doesn't know…

27:51.572 --> 27:55.796
…that means there's something
you don't know. Did you know that?

27:56.310 --> 27:58.884
–I want you to come back Friday.
–Okay.

27:58.946 --> 28:01.381
No, “imminent,”
you could be dead by Friday.

28:01.381 --> 28:05.408
Come back tomorrow at 9:45.

28:05.619 --> 28:08.655
Ten seconds ago
you said you wouldn't help me.

28:09.723 --> 28:12.759
It's been a very revealing 10 seconds,
Harold.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.796
<i>Harold was deep in thought.</i>

28:18.999 --> 28:23.670
<i>For a few, brief moments, from</i>
<i>Born Boulevard to Euclid Avenue…</i>

28:23.670 --> 28:26.340
<i>…all the calculations</i>
<i>and all the rules…</i>

28:26.340 --> 28:30.960
<i>…and all the precision of Harold's life</i>
<i>just faded away.</i>

28:31.879 --> 28:35.645
<i>How perfect then</i>
<i>that in this space…</i>

28:35.849 --> 28:38.750
<i>…Ana Pascal would appear.</i>

28:40.053 --> 28:41.213
Ms Pascal.

28:43.524 --> 28:45.926
Ms Pascal, it's Harold Crick
from the IRS.

28:45.926 --> 28:47.393
Excuse me.

28:50.631 --> 28:53.361
–Hi.
–Hi.

28:53.567 --> 28:56.331
–Would you like a seat?
–Nope.

28:56.537 --> 28:58.562
There's 11 open ones.

28:58.772 --> 29:00.501
I don't care.

29:04.378 --> 29:05.500
Sorry about that.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.690
How are you?

29:19.293 --> 29:21.523
I'm lousy. I'm being audited.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.124
Of course.

29:24.565 --> 29:26.362
By a real creep too.

29:32.539 --> 29:35.133
I think I owe you an apology.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.600
–Really?
–IRS agents…

29:38.812 --> 29:42.508
…we're given rigorous aptitude tests
before we can work.

29:42.950 --> 29:47.284
Unfortunately for you, we aren't tested
on tact or good manners…

29:47.621 --> 29:49.714
…so I apologize.

29:50.624 --> 29:53.718
I ogled you.

29:55.529 --> 29:56.894
Sorry.

30:01.168 --> 30:03.762
Okay, apology accepted.

30:04.805 --> 30:07.535
But only because you stammered.

30:14.314 --> 30:18.604
So you're a frequenter of the
metropolitan transit authority too?

30:18.652 --> 30:20.984
No. I'm just late.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.219
Big flag-burning to get to?

30:25.392 --> 30:26.916
Actually…

30:28.061 --> 30:32.521
…it's my weekly evil-conspiracy
and needlepoint group.

30:33.867 --> 30:35.494
You wanna come?

30:36.770 --> 30:40.598
I left my thimbles and socialist
reading material at home.

30:42.009 --> 30:43.408
So…

30:46.880 --> 30:50.008
<i>Harold nervously made small talk.</i>

30:51.118 --> 30:53.484
You have very straight teeth.

30:53.687 --> 30:55.348
<i>Very small talk.</i>

30:56.623 --> 30:59.592
Thanks. They're real.

30:59.793 --> 31:03.330
<i>Harold quickly calculated the odds</i>
<i>of making an ass of himself…</i>

31:03.330 --> 31:07.554
<i>…in ratio to the amount of time</i>
<i>he stayed to chat.</i>

31:08.635 --> 31:10.762
This is my stop. I should go.

31:12.906 --> 31:15.509
<i>–He was elated and surprised…</i>
–See you soon.

31:15.509 --> 31:19.997
<i>…by his somewhat flirtatious</i>
<i>encounter with Ms Pascal.</i>

31:20.013 --> 31:23.183
<i>So elated that he exited</i>
<i>the Transit Authority bus…</i>

31:23.183 --> 31:27.737
<i>…a good 27 blocks too early</i>
<i>and would now have to walk.</i>

31:46.506 --> 31:49.142
<i>–“You ain't down yet.”</i>
<i>–That's right.</i>

31:49.142 --> 31:53.880
<i>Tell us, what is</i> You Ain't Got
Nothin' On Me <i>about, Emmett Cole?</i>

31:53.880 --> 31:55.649
<i>What does this mean?</i>

31:55.649 --> 32:00.687
<i>Well, it's about being around</i>
<i>in the world, doing different things…</i>

32:00.687 --> 32:03.459
<i>…doing what you wanna do…</i>
–Come in.

32:06.126 --> 32:10.119
Mr Crick. Come in, come in. Please.

32:12.299 --> 32:13.323
How are you?

32:14.034 --> 32:15.288
I'm fine, actually.

32:15.469 --> 32:17.300
You can turn that off.

32:17.838 --> 32:20.540
Looks like our narrator
hasn't killed you quite yet.

32:20.540 --> 32:23.805
–No, not yet.
–Good, great. Have a seat.

32:24.544 --> 32:26.590
–Count the stairs outside?
–No.

32:26.747 --> 32:29.716
Course not. I've devised a test…

32:29.916 --> 32:32.490
How exciting is that?
–Of 23 questions…

32:32.586 --> 32:36.356
…which I think might help uncover
more truths about this narrator.

32:36.356 --> 32:38.187
–Now, Howard…
–Harold.

32:38.391 --> 32:42.285
Harold. These may seem silly,
but your candor is paramount.

32:42.429 --> 32:43.919
Okay.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.796
So.

32:48.001 --> 32:51.961
We know it's a woman's voice,
the story involves your death…

32:53.573 --> 32:55.342
…it's modern, it's in English.

32:55.342 --> 32:58.345
I'm assuming the author
has a cursory knowledge of the city.

32:58.345 --> 33:01.280
–Sure.
–Okay, good.

33:03.984 --> 33:05.713
Question one:

33:05.919 --> 33:08.622
“Has anyone recently left
any gifts outside your home?”

33:08.622 --> 33:10.180
Anything? Gum? Money?

33:10.390 --> 33:12.634
–A large wooden horse?
–I'm sorry?

33:12.726 --> 33:14.772
–Just answer the question.
–No.

33:14.928 --> 33:17.764
“Do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries…

33:17.764 --> 33:21.262
…in large, luxurious homes
to which…?” Let me finish.

33:21.368 --> 33:24.071
“To which you may or may not
have been invited?”

33:24.071 --> 33:25.265
No. No, no, no.

33:25.473 --> 33:28.499
All right. On a scale of one to 10…

33:28.709 --> 33:32.814
…what would you consider the
likelihood you might be assassinated?

33:32.814 --> 33:33.781
Assassinated?

33:33.981 --> 33:38.119
One being very unlikely, 10 being
expecting it around every corner.

33:38.119 --> 33:40.849
–I have no idea…
–Okay. Let me rephrase.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.680
Are you the king of anything?

33:44.759 --> 33:45.993
–Like what?
–Anything.

33:45.993 --> 33:48.496
King of the lanes
at the local bowling alley.

33:48.496 --> 33:49.895
“King of the lanes”?

33:50.097 --> 33:54.168
–King of the lanes. King of the trolls.
–“King of the trolls”?

33:54.168 --> 33:58.468
Yes. A clandestine land
found underneath your floorboards.

33:58.673 --> 33:59.970
–Anything.
–No.

34:00.174 --> 34:02.233
No. That's ridiculous.

34:02.443 --> 34:06.180
Agreed. But let's start with ridiculous
and move backwards.

34:06.180 --> 34:09.317
Now, was any part of you at one time
part of something else?

34:09.317 --> 34:11.627
Like do I have someone else's arms?

34:11.686 --> 34:14.922
Well, is it possible at one time
that you were made of stone…

34:14.922 --> 34:17.024
…wood, lye, varied corpse parts…

34:17.024 --> 34:19.594
…or earth made holy
by rabbinical elders?

34:19.594 --> 34:23.496
No. Look… I'm sorry. What do these
questions have to do with anything?

34:23.496 --> 34:25.833
The only way to find out
what story you're in…

34:25.833 --> 34:28.034
…is to determine what stories
you're not in.

34:28.034 --> 34:31.505
Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out
half of Greek literature…

34:31.505 --> 34:33.808
…seven fairy tales,
10 Chinese fables…

34:33.808 --> 34:36.944
…and determined conclusively
that you are not King Hamlet…

34:36.944 --> 34:38.935
…Scout Finch, Miss Marple…

34:39.146 --> 34:42.809
…Frankenstein's monster,
or a golem.

34:47.955 --> 34:51.025
Aren't you relieved to know
you're not a golem?

34:51.025 --> 34:54.358
Yes, I am relieved to know
that I am not a golem.

34:54.562 --> 34:55.529
Good.

35:00.468 --> 35:02.250
Do you have magical powers?

35:37.805 --> 35:40.181
May I ask what we're doing out here?

35:40.207 --> 35:43.734
–We're imagining car wrecks.
–I see.

35:45.079 --> 35:47.548
And we can't imagine
car wrecks inside?

35:47.548 --> 35:49.072
No.

35:49.917 --> 35:52.353
Did you know
that 41 percent of accidents…

35:52.353 --> 35:54.844
…occur in times
of inclement weather?

35:55.056 --> 35:57.432
So do 90 percent
of pneumonia cases.

35:57.525 --> 36:02.428
Really? Pneumonia.
That's an interesting way to die.

36:03.364 --> 36:05.992
But how would Harold
catch pneumonia?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.402
Have you written
anything new today?

36:08.402 --> 36:09.664
No.

36:09.870 --> 36:12.873
Did you read the poems I suggested,
or make a list of words…

36:12.873 --> 36:14.985
…buy new typing paper, anything?

36:15.042 --> 36:16.600
No, none of it.

36:17.979 --> 36:19.947
Sitting in the rain won't write books.

36:19.947 --> 36:24.501
Well, that illustrates exactly how much
you know about writing books.

36:31.359 --> 36:32.519
What's this?

36:33.127 --> 36:35.635
It's literature on the nicotine patch.

36:36.831 --> 36:40.593
I don't need a nicotine patch, Penny.
I smoke cigarettes.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.330
Well, it may help.

36:42.536 --> 36:45.664
May help? Help what?

36:46.140 --> 36:49.041
Help what, Penny?
Help write a novel?

36:49.243 --> 36:51.473
May help save your life.

36:51.812 --> 36:54.452
I'm not in the business of saving lives.

36:57.018 --> 36:59.043
In fact, just the opposite.

37:02.123 --> 37:04.425
–“What's your favorite word?”
–Integer.

37:04.425 --> 37:05.949
Good, good, good.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.287
“Do you aspire to anything?”

37:09.630 --> 37:12.190
–No.
–Conquer Russia?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.960
–Win a whistling contest?
–No.

37:15.169 --> 37:19.037
Harold, you must
have some ambition.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.435
–I don't think so.
–Some underlying dream. Think.

37:25.713 --> 37:27.203
Well…

37:28.349 --> 37:31.451
…I've always wanted my life
to be more musical.

37:31.752 --> 37:35.153
–Like <i>West Side Story?</i>
–No.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.454
–Like…
–What?

37:37.658 --> 37:41.156
Well, I've always wanted to learn
to play the guitar.

37:43.564 --> 37:45.191
Okay.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.203
The last thing
to determine conclusively…

37:49.203 --> 37:51.906
…is whether you're in a comedy
or a tragedy.

37:51.906 --> 37:53.424
To quote Italo Calvino:

37:53.441 --> 37:56.911
“The ultimate meaning
to which all stories refer has two faces:

37:56.911 --> 38:00.343
The continuity of life,
the inevitability of death.”

38:00.748 --> 38:04.115
Tragedy, you die.
Comedy, you get hitched.

38:07.922 --> 38:10.091
Most comic heroes
fall in love with people…

38:10.091 --> 38:12.093
…introduced after the story
has begun.

38:12.093 --> 38:14.929
Usually people
who hate the hero initially.

38:14.929 --> 38:18.729
Although I can't imagine anyone
hating you, Harold.

38:18.933 --> 38:22.733
Professor Hilbert, I'm an IRS agent.

38:23.104 --> 38:24.298
Everyone hates me.

38:25.739 --> 38:26.993
Right, right. Good.

38:27.141 --> 38:31.512
Have you met anyone recently
who might loathe the very core of you?

38:31.512 --> 38:35.208
I just started auditing a woman
who told me to get bent.

38:35.850 --> 38:37.962
Well, that sounds like a comedy.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.051
Try to develop that.

38:42.857 --> 38:43.881
Four of these?

38:44.091 --> 38:46.227
You know, I didn't get my honey,
honey.

38:46.227 --> 38:49.923
Lulu, can you refill the honey
for Larry? Quarters also?

38:49.964 --> 38:51.556
That's my good boy.

38:51.765 --> 38:53.699
I'm adding some acorns.

38:54.168 --> 38:55.567
Mr Crick.

38:56.704 --> 39:00.334
You're here early.
Must have a lot of people to extort.

39:00.341 --> 39:02.206
No. No, just you.

39:03.577 --> 39:06.375
–Twig tea and banana bread.
–Yes, ma'am.

39:06.580 --> 39:10.251
Actually, it should only take the day to
make sure 22 percent is all you owe.

39:10.251 --> 39:14.145
Well, I won't be paying no matter
the percentage, Mr Crick.

39:14.188 --> 39:18.148
No, I know. But the percent
determines how big your cell is.

39:24.732 --> 39:26.567
You know, you can call me Harold.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.730
Yeah, I know. But I don't want to.

39:31.939 --> 39:33.340
This is for Ramona, honey.

39:33.340 --> 39:36.036
–Oh, thank you.
–You're very welcome.

39:36.677 --> 39:38.987
What is that?
What are you marking?

39:40.514 --> 39:42.038
Oh, this is nothing.

39:42.249 --> 39:45.377
Why don't we start
with your backup documents…

39:45.586 --> 39:48.255
…and the receipts
for the past three years.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.745
Sure.

39:58.433 --> 39:59.627
What's this?

40:01.036 --> 40:03.129
–My files.
–What?

40:03.338 --> 40:04.828
My tax files.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.442
You keep your files like this?

40:07.442 --> 40:10.240
No, actually I'm quite fastidious.

40:10.445 --> 40:13.972
I put them in this box
just to screw with you.

40:27.529 --> 40:30.862
–Hi.
–Hi. How are you?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.662
So how was it? Aruba.

40:34.869 --> 40:38.373
Ms Pascal? Can I just ask you
a question about this receipt?

40:38.373 --> 40:41.443
–It was fantastic.
–Just wondering if this nine is a seven.

40:41.443 --> 40:44.674
–And what did you do?
–I got a beautiful tan.

40:45.313 --> 40:49.537
–I'm just gonna guess it's a seven.
–I mean, I feel stress-free.

40:54.122 --> 40:55.904
Do you need help with that?

40:57.025 --> 40:59.261
–Walk to heaven. I see the president.

40:59.261 --> 41:01.630
–It's the taxman. Hello, Mr Taxman.
–Yeah.

41:01.630 --> 41:03.298
–You can call me Harold.
–Okay.

41:03.298 --> 41:05.133
–How the numbers going?
–Pretty good.

41:05.133 --> 41:07.102
–Gonna find that 22 percent?
–22 percent?

41:07.102 --> 41:09.804
Twenty-two, 11 times 2.
It's prime numbers.

41:09.804 --> 41:13.008
–You gonna tax the bathroom?
–No, I'm not gonna tax the bathroom.

41:13.008 --> 41:15.477
–Could I use the bathroom, then?
–Go for it.

41:15.477 --> 41:17.379
Okay. I wanna use the bathroom.
Bye now.

41:17.379 --> 41:18.505
Bye-bye.

42:00.455 --> 42:01.820
Well, good night.

42:02.957 --> 42:04.618
You want a cookie?

42:05.260 --> 42:06.386
Oh, no.

42:06.594 --> 42:10.752
Come on. They're warm and gooey.
They're fresh out of the oven.

42:11.433 --> 42:13.230
No, I don't like cookies.

42:15.270 --> 42:16.897
You don't like cookies?

42:20.008 --> 42:23.102
–What's wrong with you?
–I don't know.

42:23.311 --> 42:26.246
–Everybody likes cookies.
–No, I know.

42:26.448 --> 42:30.350
I mean, after a really awful,
no-good day…

42:30.552 --> 42:33.786
…didn't your mama ever make you
milk and cookies?

42:34.622 --> 42:38.114
No. My mother didn't bake.

42:38.326 --> 42:41.454
The only cookies I ever had
were store-bought.

42:43.998 --> 42:46.831
Okay. Sit down.

42:47.469 --> 42:49.596
–No, I'm…
–No.

42:50.071 --> 42:51.868
Sit down.

42:55.744 --> 42:56.938
Now…

42:57.946 --> 42:59.971
…eat a cookie.

43:00.181 --> 43:01.546
I really can't.

43:01.750 --> 43:05.083
Mr Crick, it was a really awful day.

43:05.987 --> 43:08.820
I know, I made sure of it.

43:09.324 --> 43:11.019
So pick up the cookie…

43:11.226 --> 43:13.353
…dip it in the milk…

43:13.561 --> 43:15.358
…and eat it.

43:39.921 --> 43:42.297
That's a really, really good cookie.

43:50.565 --> 43:53.271
So when did you decide
to become a baker?

43:53.635 --> 43:56.536
–In college.
–Oh, like a cooking college?

43:57.672 --> 44:00.800
I went to Harvard Law actually.

44:01.376 --> 44:06.507
–Oh, I'm sorry, I just assumed it was…
–No. No, it's fine. I didn't finish.

44:07.282 --> 44:09.250
–Did something happen?
–No.

44:10.652 --> 44:14.645
I was barely accepted.
I mean, really barely.

44:14.856 --> 44:18.193
The only reason they let me come
was because of my essay.

44:18.193 --> 44:22.219
How I was gonna make the world
a better place with my degree.

44:22.964 --> 44:27.697
Anyway, we would have to participate
in these study sessions…

44:27.902 --> 44:31.004
…my classmates and I,
sometimes all night long.

44:31.105 --> 44:34.933
And so I'd bake so no one
would go hungry while we worked.

44:35.043 --> 44:38.213
Sometimes I would bake all afternoon
in the kitchen in the dorm…

44:38.213 --> 44:42.240
…and then I'd bring my little treats
to the study groups…

44:42.450 --> 44:44.077
…and people loved them.

44:44.285 --> 44:45.547
Eat.

44:45.753 --> 44:50.019
I made oatmeal cookies,
peanut-butter bars…

44:50.492 --> 44:53.928
…dark-chocolate
macadamia-nut wedges.

44:54.128 --> 44:56.636
And everyone would eat
and stay happy…

44:56.664 --> 44:59.033
…and study harder
and do better on the tests.

44:59.033 --> 45:01.936
More and more people started
coming to the study groups…

45:01.936 --> 45:03.767
…and I'd bring more snacks.

45:03.972 --> 45:06.708
I was always looking
for better and better recipes…

45:06.708 --> 45:12.237
…until soon it was ricotta cheese
and apricot croissants…

45:13.114 --> 45:15.639
…and mocha bars
with an almond glaze…

45:15.850 --> 45:20.480
…and lemon chiffon cake
with zesty peach icing.

45:21.589 --> 45:25.616
And at the end of the semester
I had 27 study partners…

45:25.827 --> 45:29.263
…eight Mead journals
filled with recipes…

45:29.464 --> 45:30.988
…and a D average.

45:31.933 --> 45:33.730
So I dropped out.

45:34.335 --> 45:37.071
I figured if I was gonna
make the world a better place…

45:37.071 --> 45:39.232
…I would do it with cookies.

45:44.078 --> 45:45.511
You like them?

45:47.015 --> 45:48.004
I do.

45:49.083 --> 45:50.880
I'm glad.

45:51.953 --> 45:54.395
Thank you for forcing me
to eat them.

45:54.789 --> 45:56.552
You're welcome.

46:01.829 --> 46:04.799
I should go. Oh, thank you.
For the cookies, I mean.

46:04.799 --> 46:06.768
–Why don't you take them home?
–Oh, no.

46:06.768 --> 46:09.012
–Oh, come on.
–No, really, please.

46:09.137 --> 46:12.371
–No, really, please.
–No, no, no. Really, please.

46:12.373 --> 46:14.432
I would like to, but I can't.

46:15.109 --> 46:16.844
–You can't?
–No, no, I mean…

46:16.844 --> 46:19.540
Because, see, it constitutes a gift.

46:19.881 --> 46:22.650
Actually I shouldn't have even had
those other ones, so…

46:22.650 --> 46:25.054
Okay. Well, I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

46:25.054 --> 46:27.890
–No. I know, but if you did…
–Well, I'm not going to.

46:27.890 --> 46:29.191
I know, but if you did…

46:29.191 --> 46:32.461
–What, you think I'm gonna call the…?
–No, no. I'll purchase them.

46:32.461 --> 46:35.589
I'm happy to purchase them.
How's that?

46:37.633 --> 46:40.033
And then there are no issues.

46:42.137 --> 46:44.367
–What?
–No.

46:44.573 --> 46:46.632
–Please.
–Just…

46:46.842 --> 46:48.756
–Why don't I just…?
–Go home.

46:48.877 --> 46:50.379
Really, it's not a big deal.

46:50.379 --> 46:52.506
Go home.

46:54.183 --> 46:55.548
Okay.

47:00.155 --> 47:01.452
Did you?

47:03.058 --> 47:06.050
You baked those cookies for me,
didn't you?

47:09.698 --> 47:13.262
You were just trying to be nice
and I totally blew it.

47:17.006 --> 47:20.237
This may sound like gibberish
to you…

47:22.745 --> 47:25.236
…but I think I'm in a tragedy.

47:55.844 --> 47:59.882
Professor Hilbert, I've totally failed
at the comedy-tragedy thing.

47:59.882 --> 48:02.251
In fact, I think she likes me even less.

48:02.251 --> 48:04.825
–I know, it's great.
–What do you mean?

48:05.287 --> 48:07.756
You've proved something else
entirely.

48:07.756 --> 48:11.419
The voice seems to be dependent
on actions you take.

48:12.528 --> 48:15.197
You reset your watch,
it says you reset your watch.

48:15.197 --> 48:17.199
You ride a bus,
it says you ride the bus.

48:17.199 --> 48:19.768
You brush your teeth,
it says you brush your teeth.

48:19.768 --> 48:23.795
It may be that you yourself
are perpetuating the story.

48:24.006 --> 48:27.669
–So I suggest we try something else.
–Like what?

48:27.876 --> 48:31.107
–Try nothing. Nothing.
–What about Ms Pascal?

48:31.313 --> 48:32.715
–Forget her.
–Forget her?

48:32.715 --> 48:34.883
Other than numbers,
she's all I think about.

48:34.883 --> 48:37.820
Harold, if you wanna stay alive,
you'll try something else.

48:37.820 --> 48:41.153
–That something being nothing?
–Nothing, exactly.

48:41.356 --> 48:44.052
–Nothing?
–Let me explain this again.

48:44.259 --> 48:48.097
Some plots are moved forward
by external events and crises.

48:48.097 --> 48:50.999
Others are moved forward
by the characters themselves.

48:50.999 --> 48:53.402
If I go through that door,
the plot continues.

48:53.402 --> 48:55.871
The story of me through the door.
If I stay here…

48:55.871 --> 48:58.507
…the plot can't move forward,
the story ends.

48:58.507 --> 49:01.305
Also if I stay here, I'm late.

49:03.645 --> 49:06.153
–Don't do anything tomorrow.
–Nothing?

49:06.248 --> 49:10.708
Stay home. Don't answer the phone,
open the door, brush your teeth.

49:10.919 --> 49:12.521
–What about work?
–Call them.

49:12.521 --> 49:14.957
–Tell them you're not coming.
–Don't go to work?

49:14.957 --> 49:17.292
Don't do anything that may
move the plot forward.

49:17.292 --> 49:19.962
Instead, let's see if the plot finds you.

49:19.962 --> 49:22.556
Marshall, you're not kicking.

49:25.934 --> 49:29.638
<i>–Certain that these geese have never</i>
<i>known any home but this one:</i>

49:29.638 --> 49:32.146
<i>A small lake in Eastern Poland.</i>

49:32.341 --> 49:35.644
<i>Pollution from a nearby factory</i>
<i>is slowly killing…</i>

49:35.644 --> 49:39.348
<i>…the small fish and insects</i>
<i>on which these creatures feed.</i>

49:39.348 --> 49:44.787
<i>All attempts to move the birds to</i>
<i>similar bodies of water have failed.</i>

49:44.787 --> 49:48.824
<i>Perhaps it is the familiarity alone</i>
<i>that keeps them here.</i>

49:48.824 --> 49:53.028
O <i>r perhaps it's an unwillingness</i>
<i>to lose the collective memory…</i>

49:53.028 --> 49:56.231
<i>…of the once-beautiful hills</i>
<i>that surround the lake.</i>

49:56.231 --> 50:00.102
<i>And it takes only seconds</i>
<i>for the fiddler crabs to realize…</i>

50:00.102 --> 50:02.638
<i>…that the wader</i>
<i>they might once have feared…</i>

50:02.638 --> 50:05.129
<i>…has now become their prey.</i>

50:06.475 --> 50:09.342
<i>The wounded bird knows its fate.</i>

50:10.312 --> 50:12.648
<i>Its desperate attempts to escape…</i>

50:12.648 --> 50:16.740
<i>…only underscore the hopelessness</i>
<i>of its plight.</i>

50:18.987 --> 50:23.792
<i>The primates' sad, soulful eyes</i>
<i>will be the first to be plucked out…</i>

50:23.792 --> 50:26.795
<i>…then sold to cosmetic companies</i>
<i>around the world…</i>

50:26.795 --> 50:30.999
<i>…for use in the testing of mascara</i>
<i>and artificial tears.</i>

50:30.999 --> 50:35.070
<i>Next, the monkeys' fur will be stripped</i>
<i>away from their limp corpses…</i>

50:35.070 --> 50:38.640
<i>…and sewn together</i>
<i>to form pillows and comforters.</i>

50:38.640 --> 50:41.343
<i>Mr Zebra thought he was gonna</i>
<i>take a nice drink.</i>

50:41.343 --> 50:43.178
<i>But you never know</i>
<i>who's gonna eat…</i>

50:43.178 --> 50:45.647
<i>…when you're dining</i>
<i>at Mother Nature's restaurant.</i>

50:45.647 --> 50:48.550
<i>That's gotta hurt. What does</i>
<i>this bald eagle wanna serve…</i>

50:48.550 --> 50:50.786
<i>…with some kidney beans</i>
<i>and a fine Chianti?</i>

50:50.786 --> 50:54.779
<i>It's an eel. And again:</i>

50:54.990 --> 50:57.459
<i>Looks like old Mr Crocodile</i>
<i>wanted some antelope…</i>

50:57.459 --> 50:59.695
<i>…to clear that salty zebra</i>
<i>from his palate.</i>

50:59.695 --> 51:03.265
<i>Here's a struggle betting gentlemen</i>
<i>have been known to put money on.</i>

51:03.265 --> 51:07.202
<i>When a mongoose encounters a cobra</i>
<i>it's hard to know who's gonna win.</i>

51:07.202 --> 51:09.571
<i>But this time it looks like</i>
<i>it's… the cobra…</i>

51:09.571 --> 51:11.874
<i>…who's putting the squeeze</i>
<i>on the mongoose!</i>

51:11.874 --> 51:14.309
<i>But don't cash in your chips</i>
<i>just yet, gentlemen…</i>

51:14.309 --> 51:19.061
<i>…because now it's the mongoose</i>
<i>who holds the winning card!</i>

51:44.306 --> 51:46.536
Hey! Hey!

51:47.309 --> 51:49.411
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

51:49.411 --> 51:51.580
–Holy crapping hell.
–What the hell is that?

51:51.580 --> 51:53.982
–Stop the crane. Stop it.
–Stop the crane!

51:53.982 --> 51:56.028
–Hey.
–Hey, what are you doing?

51:56.151 --> 51:57.812
Us? What are you doing?

51:58.020 --> 51:59.681
I was watching TV.

51:59.888 --> 52:03.558
–Well, we're demolishing this place.
–Are you nuts? I live here!

52:03.558 --> 52:06.495
–Is that a TV?
–Yes, that's a TV! It's my TV!

52:06.495 --> 52:09.631
–Well, what's your TV doing in there?
–I said I live here, stupid!

52:09.631 --> 52:11.413
It's where I keep my stuff!

52:11.600 --> 52:14.899
My name's on the goddamn buzzer!
Harold Crick.

52:15.103 --> 52:18.072
Apartment 2-B, 1893 McCarthy!

52:19.041 --> 52:21.509
–Did you say 1893?
–Yes!

52:28.116 --> 52:30.285
I'm not exactly sure it was plot.

52:30.285 --> 52:33.522
I was hoping you'd say it was
just a really bad coincidence.

52:33.522 --> 52:37.159
Meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence.

52:37.159 --> 52:41.063
Getting a letter from the emperor
saying that he's visiting is plot.

52:41.063 --> 52:44.226
Having your apartment eaten
by a wrecking ball…

52:44.433 --> 52:46.281
…is something else entirely.

52:47.703 --> 52:51.161
Harold, you don't control your fate.

52:51.907 --> 52:54.342
–I know.
–You do?

52:55.912 --> 52:57.641
Okay. Come with me.

52:57.847 --> 53:00.748
Hey, Tom, can you leave that
till tomorrow?

53:01.317 --> 53:04.654
You were right.
This narrator might very well kill you…

53:04.654 --> 53:09.472
…so I humbly suggest that you just
forget all this and go live your life.

53:09.559 --> 53:14.509
Go live my life? I am living my life.
I'd like to continue to live my life.

53:14.564 --> 53:18.898
I know. Of course. I mean all of it.
However long you have left.

53:19.102 --> 53:22.739
You know, I mean, Howard,
you could use it to have an adventure.

53:22.739 --> 53:27.477
You know, invent something, or just
finish reading <i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

53:27.477 --> 53:31.781
Hell, Harold, you could just eat
nothing but pancakes if you wanted.

53:31.781 --> 53:33.772
What's wrong with you?

53:33.983 --> 53:37.320
Hey. I don't wanna eat
nothing but pancakes. I wanna live.

53:37.320 --> 53:40.523
Who in their right mind in a
choice between pancakes and living…

53:40.523 --> 53:41.691
…chooses pancakes?

53:41.691 --> 53:44.794
Harold, if you'd pause to think
I believe you'd realize…

53:44.794 --> 53:47.196
…that that answer's
inextricably contingent…

53:47.196 --> 53:49.391
…upon the type of life being led…

53:50.867 --> 53:53.961
…and, of course,
the quality of the pancakes.

53:55.838 --> 53:58.280
You don't understand
what I'm saying.

53:59.042 --> 54:00.066
Yes, I do.

54:01.310 --> 54:05.181
But you have to understand that this
isn't a philosophy or a literary theory…

54:05.181 --> 54:07.183
…or a story to me. It's my life.

54:07.183 --> 54:11.882
Absolutely. So just go make it the one
you've always wanted.

54:19.495 --> 54:21.531
I never expected
that they would have…

54:21.531 --> 54:23.566
–Do you want one, two?
–I want one.

54:23.566 --> 54:25.864
–One?
–I want two.

54:36.879 --> 54:38.815
All right, so here's your room.

54:38.815 --> 54:41.409
Or as I like to call it, Sleep Pod Two.

54:42.018 --> 54:43.315
Thanks, Dave.

54:43.519 --> 54:47.011
No problem, dude.
It'll be nice having you around.

54:48.057 --> 54:51.291
–How long you planning on staying?
–I'm not sure.

54:57.133 --> 55:01.627
Dave, can I pose a somewhat abstract,
purely hypothetical question?

55:02.105 --> 55:03.572
Sure.

55:04.273 --> 55:06.434
If you knew you were gonna die…

55:07.777 --> 55:09.608
…possibly soon…

55:10.012 --> 55:11.946
…what would you do?

55:13.783 --> 55:15.580
Wow, I don't know.

55:16.419 --> 55:18.588
Am I the richest man in the world?

55:18.588 --> 55:20.783
No, you're you.

55:22.425 --> 55:23.943
Do I have a superpower?

55:24.861 --> 55:26.158
No, you're you.

55:26.362 --> 55:30.162
I know I'm me,
but do I have a superpower?

55:30.967 --> 55:32.902
No, why would you
have a superpower?

55:32.902 --> 55:35.638
I don't know,
you said it was hypothetical.

55:35.638 --> 55:38.698
Fine. Yes. You're really good at math.

55:39.108 --> 55:41.418
That's not a power, that's a skill.

55:41.711 --> 55:44.313
Okay, you're good at math
and you're invisible.

55:44.313 --> 55:47.217
–And you know you're gonna die.
–Okay, okay.

55:47.884 --> 55:50.128
That's easy, I'd go to space camp.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.412
Space camp?

55:52.622 --> 55:57.638
Yeah, it's in Alabama. It's where kids
go to learn how to become astronauts.

55:58.327 --> 56:00.901
I've always wanted to go
since I was 9.

56:01.464 --> 56:04.368
You're invisible
and you'd go to space camp?

56:04.433 --> 56:07.469
I didn't pick invisible,
you picked invisible.

56:07.803 --> 56:10.377
Aren't you too old
to go to space camp?

56:11.040 --> 56:14.142
You're never too old
to go to space camp, dude.

56:45.141 --> 56:46.108
Space camp.

56:47.476 --> 56:50.246
O <i>ne hundred and twenty-two</i>
<i>guitars.</i>

56:50.246 --> 56:52.915
<i>Seven hundred and thirty-two</i>
<i>strings.</i>

56:52.915 --> 56:55.251
<i>Two hundred and fifty-seven</i>
<i>pickups.</i>

56:55.251 --> 56:58.881
O <i>ne hundred and eighty-nine</i>
<i>volume knobs.</i>

56:59.522 --> 57:04.824
<i>Here Harold stood, face to face</i>
<i>with his oldest desire.</i>

57:05.361 --> 57:08.353
<i>And stand is almost all Harold did.</i>

57:08.831 --> 57:12.068
<i>It wasn't just about finding</i>
<i>a guitar.</i>

57:12.068 --> 57:17.267
<i>It was about finding a guitar</i>
<i>that said something about Harold.</i>

57:17.473 --> 57:19.575
<i>Unfortunately, this guitar said:</i>

57:19.575 --> 57:24.525
<i>“When I get back to Georgia,</i>
<i>that woman gonna feel my pain. ”</i>

57:25.448 --> 57:27.783
<i>This one said something</i>
<i>along the lines of:</i>

57:27.783 --> 57:30.752
<i>“Why, yes, these pants are Lycra.”</i>

57:31.387 --> 57:34.257
<i>These said, “I'm very sensitive,</i>
<i>very caring…</i>

57:34.257 --> 57:38.877
<i>…and I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how to play the guitar. ”</i>

57:41.964 --> 57:45.924
<i>“I'm compensating for something.</i>
<i>Guess what. ”</i>

57:50.573 --> 57:52.553
<i>And then Harold saw it.</i>

57:53.442 --> 57:56.946
<i>A damaged and terribly mistreated</i>
<i>sea-foam-green Fender…</i>

57:56.946 --> 57:58.781
<i>…staring back at him.</i>

57:58.781 --> 58:00.716
<i>Despite its obvious maladies…</i>

58:00.716 --> 58:04.186
<i>…the guitar spoke</i>
<i>with conviction and swagger.</i>

58:04.186 --> 58:09.025
<i>In fact, it looked Harold directly</i>
<i>in the eye and very plainly stated:</i>

58:09.025 --> 58:11.721
<i>“I rock.”</i>

58:12.595 --> 58:14.096
Just breathe. Watch it!

58:14.096 --> 58:18.320
We've got a 21 -year-old male
with a gunshot wound to the chest.

58:18.834 --> 58:20.096
There you go.

58:20.469 --> 58:24.906
Shot in a gang fight?
Harold's not in a gang.

58:25.441 --> 58:27.375
Man in tweed?

58:29.578 --> 58:32.915
There's nothing wrong with him,
he just likes looking at sick people.

58:32.915 --> 58:35.110
Oddly spoken with disdain.

58:35.384 --> 58:36.817
This isn't working.

58:37.019 --> 58:39.593
Well… I don't even know
why we're here.

58:39.655 --> 58:41.557
I don't think we're supposed
to be here.

58:41.557 --> 58:44.994
–You said I needed visual stimuli.
–I meant a museum.

58:44.994 --> 58:47.363
I don't need a goddamn museum.
I need the infirm.

58:47.363 --> 58:49.354
You are the infirm.

58:49.865 --> 58:52.601
You're right. The problem is
these people aren't dead…

58:52.601 --> 58:54.647
…they're just severely injured.

58:55.237 --> 58:58.206
Excuse me,
where are the dying people?

58:59.608 --> 59:02.441
Most of these people
are sick or injured…

59:02.645 --> 59:04.747
Which is great, don't get me wrong.

59:04.747 --> 59:07.616
–But they're gonna get better,
which doesn't really help me.

59:07.616 --> 59:11.153
Is there any way to see the people
who aren't going to get better?

59:11.153 --> 59:12.120
Excuse me?

59:12.321 --> 59:15.725
I'd like to see, if at all possible,
the ones who aren't gonna make it.

59:15.725 --> 59:17.560
You know, the dead-for-sure ones.

59:17.560 --> 59:20.398
I'm sorry,
are you suffering from anything?

59:22.732 --> 59:24.928
Just writer's block.

59:32.709 --> 59:34.821
<i>With every awkward strum…</i>

59:34.978 --> 59:38.648
<i>…Harold Crick became stronger</i>
<i>in who he was…</i>

59:38.648 --> 59:42.379
<i>…what he wanted,</i>
<i>and why he was alive.</i>

59:43.620 --> 59:46.487
<i>Harold no longer ate alone.</i>

59:46.723 --> 59:49.920
<i>He no longer counted brushstrokes.</i>

59:50.127 --> 59:52.729
–Harold, I'll see you.
<i>–He no longer wore neckties.</i>

59:52.729 --> 59:53.696
Bye, Dave.

59:53.964 --> 59:59.640
<i>And, therefore, no longer worried</i>
<i>about the time it took to put them on.</i>

01:00:01.138 --> 01:00:05.165
<i>He no longer counted his steps</i>
<i>to the bus stop.</i>

01:00:07.644 --> 01:00:12.946
<i>Instead, Harold did that</i>
<i>which had terrified him before.</i>

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.520
<i>That which had eluded him</i>
<i>Monday through Friday…</i>

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.683
<i>…for so many years.</i>

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.426
<i>That which the unrelenting lyrics…</i>

01:00:22.426 --> 01:00:26.658
<i>…of numerous punk-rock songs</i>
<i>told him to do:</i>

01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:30.498
<i>Harold Crick lived his life.</i>

01:00:39.709 --> 01:00:42.507
<i>But despite resuscitating his life…</i>

01:00:42.712 --> 01:00:46.950
<i>…reviving his hope, and instilling</i>
<i>a few wicked calluses…</i>

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:50.448
<i>…Harold's journey</i>
<i>was still incomplete.</i>

01:00:50.987 --> 01:00:56.926
<i>And Harold's wristwatch wasn't about</i>
<i>to let him miss another opportunity.</i>

01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:07.430
Ms Pascal?

01:01:07.637 --> 01:01:10.367
–Ms Pascal?
–Mr Crick.

01:01:11.074 --> 01:01:13.565
–Hi.
–Hi.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.570
–Hi.
–Hi.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.748
I'm glad I caught you.

01:01:19.583 --> 01:01:20.880
Oh, yeah? Why?

01:01:22.185 --> 01:01:25.552
Because I wanted
to bring these to you.

01:01:27.324 --> 01:01:29.519
–Really?
–Yeah.

01:01:29.726 --> 01:01:34.095
So you can't accept gifts,
but you can give them?

01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:36.333
–Listen…
–I don't know.

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:38.969
That seems a little inconsistent,
doesn't it, Mr Crick?

01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:40.403
Very inconsistent, yes.

01:01:40.403 --> 01:01:42.939
I'll tell you what.
I'll purchase them.

01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:44.589
–No.
–No, no, no, really…

01:01:44.608 --> 01:01:47.380
…I'd like to purchase them.
What are they?

01:01:47.944 --> 01:01:49.343
Flours.

01:01:50.013 --> 01:01:53.449
–What?
–I brought you flours.

01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:08.320
And you carried them
all the way here?

01:02:09.966 --> 01:02:15.097
Ms Pascal, I've been odd
and I know that I've been odd.

01:02:16.139 --> 01:02:18.937
And I want you.

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:21.944
–What?
–There's so many reasons.

01:02:22.145 --> 01:02:25.515
There's so many influences in my life
that are telling me…

01:02:25.515 --> 01:02:27.231
…at times quite literally…

01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:30.254
…that I should come here
and bring you these…

01:02:31.154 --> 01:02:33.728
…but I'm doing this
because I want you.

01:02:34.558 --> 01:02:36.423
You want me?

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:39.452
In no uncertain terms.

01:02:42.265 --> 01:02:47.498
Isn't there some very clear
and established…

01:02:47.704 --> 01:02:51.333
…rule about fraternization?

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:53.736
–Auditor-auditee protocol?
–Yeah.

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:56.208
Yeah, but I don't care.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.943
–Why?
–Because I want you.

01:03:05.488 --> 01:03:06.455
Well…

01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:11.959
…do you mind carrying those
a little bit further?

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:13.793
Okay.

01:03:16.566 --> 01:03:17.965
Okay.

01:03:31.815 --> 01:03:33.612
Did you make a key?

01:03:33.817 --> 01:03:36.061
No, I just committed it to memory.

01:03:36.186 --> 01:03:40.247
–The blue, that's barley flour.
–What's that one?

01:03:40.457 --> 01:03:41.822
–The orange?
–Yeah.

01:03:42.025 --> 01:03:43.617
I forget.

01:03:44.227 --> 01:03:45.194
Right here.

01:03:48.832 --> 01:03:50.527
Do you wanna come up?

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.528
–To your place?
–Yeah.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.074
I guess I could.

01:03:59.275 --> 01:04:03.211
Wasn't that the idea with the flours
and everything?

01:04:04.714 --> 01:04:08.878
Honestly, I only figured it out
up to “I want you.”

01:04:09.886 --> 01:04:11.877
Listen, Mr Crick…

01:04:12.856 --> 01:04:14.346
…I think I like you.

01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:20.627
And before I do anything rash,
I'd like to make sure.

01:04:22.132 --> 01:04:24.191
I'd like you to come up.

01:04:25.735 --> 01:04:27.566
I'd be honored.

01:04:28.738 --> 01:04:30.137
Great.

01:04:33.476 --> 01:04:35.111
<i>Yeah, he was nuts though.</i>

01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:39.015
<i>He got caught when he tried</i>
<i>to get the contract notarized.</i>

01:04:39.015 --> 01:04:41.779
No. No.

01:04:46.356 --> 01:04:47.653
Was it good?

01:04:48.258 --> 01:04:49.225
Thank you.

01:04:49.426 --> 01:04:51.894
–You're welcome.
–Can I help you?

01:04:52.095 --> 01:04:56.385
No, no, I'm gonna put them in the sink.
Go sit down on the couch.

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:06.757
So do you play the guitar?

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:09.301
–What?
–Do you play the guitar?

01:05:09.979 --> 01:05:14.245
Terribly. Someone traded me that
for a wedding cake.

01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:18.080
Does that mean I have to claim it
on my taxes now?

01:05:18.288 --> 01:05:22.748
–No. I'll leave it out of my final report.
–Oh, thanks.

01:05:23.727 --> 01:05:25.058
Do you play?

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:26.963
Not really. I only know one song.

01:05:26.963 --> 01:05:28.362
Oh, play it.

01:05:28.565 --> 01:05:31.000
No, I don't know it that well, actually.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.070
No, come on. I promise I'm not gonna
laugh at you. Play it.

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:36.314
No, no, no. Maybe some other time.

01:05:36.473 --> 01:05:37.997
All right.

01:08:03.587 --> 01:08:04.849
Ms Pascal?

01:08:05.356 --> 01:08:08.553
–I…
–I know.

01:08:08.759 --> 01:08:10.727
I want you too.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:36.279
<i>Harold's life was filled with moments</i>
<i>both significant and mundane.</i>

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:41.754
<i>But to Harold, those moments</i>
<i>remained entirely indistinguishable…</i>

01:08:41.959 --> 01:08:43.654
<i>…except for this.</i>

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:49.399
<i>As Ana let out a soft sigh and</i>
<i>repositioned herself against him…</i>

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:51.734
<i>…Harold knew</i>
<i>somewhere in his heart…</i>

01:08:51.734 --> 01:08:54.738
<i>…that this was one</i>
<i>of the significant moments.</i>

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:58.606
<i>He knew she was</i>
<i>falling in love with him.</i>

01:09:01.111 --> 01:09:03.180
Professor Hilbert. It's a comedy.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.908
–What?
–A comedy.

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:09.575
The woman. The one who hates me.
Ana Pascal?

01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:11.880
–Last night…
–Yeah?

01:09:12.089 --> 01:09:13.924
She's falling in love with me.

01:09:13.924 --> 01:09:15.893
–She is?
–It's like a miracle.

01:09:15.893 --> 01:09:18.429
The voice confirmed it
in the middle of the night.

01:09:18.429 --> 01:09:20.029
Well, that's wonderful, Harold.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.267
I mean, it completely nullifies my list,
but that's fantastic.

01:09:23.267 --> 01:09:24.359
What list?

01:09:24.568 --> 01:09:26.970
These are seven living authors
whose prior work…

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.872
…would seem to make them
candidates to write your story…

01:09:29.872 --> 01:09:32.776
…based on the criteria you and I
previously determined.

01:09:32.776 --> 01:09:36.974
If your narrator is alive,
she's on this list.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:40.818
But it appears the list
is of little use to you now.

01:09:40.818 --> 01:09:42.987
Now that you're gonna live
happily ever after.

01:09:42.987 --> 01:09:47.673
Oh, goodie. This woman, Karen Eiffel,
she's one of my favorite authors.

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:49.276
<i>–Hi.</i>
<i>–Hi.</i>

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:51.595
Beautiful tragedies. Just beautiful.
Anyway…

01:09:51.595 --> 01:09:56.123
…let me quickly copy this list for you,
just in case.

01:09:57.835 --> 01:10:00.235
Sociopathic author.

01:10:00.437 --> 01:10:03.099
–I just wanted to thank you.
–Of course.

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:07.711
Listen, please, you must tell me if you
hear the voice of the narrator again…

01:10:07.711 --> 01:10:09.380
…just for my own edification.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.870
I will.

01:10:13.517 --> 01:10:16.220
<i>Well, it's called</i> Death and Taxes.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.950
<i>Wow. You know, I'm from Texas.</i>

01:10:19.156 --> 01:10:22.717
<i>No. Not “Texas.” Taxes.</i>

01:10:22.926 --> 01:10:25.121
Death and Taxes.
Death and Taxes.

01:10:25.329 --> 01:10:27.464
<i>Taxes.</i>
<i>Like the Benjamin Franklin quote.</i>

01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:29.329
<i>Precisely so.</i>

01:10:29.533 --> 01:10:31.668
<i>This lady's a package,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

01:10:31.668 --> 01:10:35.372
<i>Tell us, what is this next book</i>
<i>going to be about?</i>

01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:37.840
<i>It's about interconnectivity.</i>

01:10:39.143 --> 01:10:41.805
<i>The looming certainty of death.</i>

01:10:42.012 --> 01:10:43.847
<i>Men's fashion accessories.</i>

01:10:43.847 --> 01:10:45.893
–Oh, my God, that's her.
–What?

01:10:45.949 --> 01:10:49.219
–That's the voice. She's the narrator.
–No, that can't be right.

01:10:49.219 --> 01:10:50.880
No, I'm positive.

01:10:51.088 --> 01:10:53.596
Harold, this interview's a decade old.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:56.560
<i>I didn't think anyone actually</i>
<i>wore cuff links anymore.</i>

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.255
That's her.

01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:01.192
–She's British?
–She's her.

01:11:01.398 --> 01:11:04.896
–Karen Eiffel?
–Professor Hilbert, I know that voice.

01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:06.503
Crap.

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:09.807
–What's wrong?
–First of all, she wasn't on my list.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:14.471
I figured you would have mentioned
the accent and she doesn't…

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:16.935
She kills people.

01:11:18.015 --> 01:11:20.449
–What?
–In every book she…

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.420
The books are all about…
They die. She kills them.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.355
–Kills who?
–The heroes.

01:11:26.557 --> 01:11:29.065
Four Black Veils. <i>What is that?</i>

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:31.995
<i>It's about a girl who loses</i>
<i>several members of her family…</i>

01:11:31.995 --> 01:11:33.797
<i>…in quick succession.</i>

01:11:33.797 --> 01:11:35.025
Where is she?

01:11:35.232 --> 01:11:40.260
She's untraceable. Believe me,
I used to teach a class on her.

01:11:40.471 --> 01:11:43.941
I've written her letters. I mean,
she's a hermit, she's a recluse.

01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:47.206
Here. Here's the last book she wrote.

01:11:47.411 --> 01:11:50.681
Look at the copyright. She hasn't
published anything in 10 years.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:53.217
She had knowledge of the city.
Does she live here?

01:11:53.217 --> 01:11:54.885
She used to, yes, but I mean…

01:11:54.885 --> 01:11:58.055
Banneker Press. 2267 Wallace Street.
Is that her publisher?

01:11:58.055 --> 01:12:01.425
You're not listening. I said even
if you find her she's not gonna…

01:12:01.425 --> 01:12:03.009
Thank you for your help.

01:12:03.026 --> 01:12:04.789
She only writes tragedies!

01:12:04.995 --> 01:12:06.975
<i>I don't believe in God.</i>

01:12:34.492 --> 01:12:37.393
Okay, he's bringing her flours.

01:12:48.973 --> 01:12:51.567
Kay, where you been?

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.478
I went out to buy cigarettes…

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.584
…and I figured out
how to kill Harold Crick.

01:12:59.717 --> 01:13:01.048
Buying cigarettes?

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:04.688
As I was…
When I came out of the store…

01:13:04.989 --> 01:13:07.253
…it came to me.

01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:09.223
How?

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:11.896
Well, Penny,
like anything worth writing…

01:13:11.896 --> 01:13:14.956
…it came inexplicably
and without method.

01:13:15.166 --> 01:13:18.397
I see. Then what happens?

01:13:19.237 --> 01:13:23.641
It's perfect, actually. I can't believe
I didn't think of it earlier.

01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:26.576
It's simple, ironic…

01:13:27.078 --> 01:13:29.273
…possibly heartbreaking.

01:13:30.582 --> 01:13:31.913
Is that it?

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.308
Yes.

01:13:33.518 --> 01:13:36.356
–You wrote it on legal sheets?
–On the bus.

01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:39.321
Well, then.

01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:47.131
So I'll finish it today.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.114
I'll let the publishers know.

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.661
I'll begin packing my things.

01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:55.839
I appreciate it.

01:14:12.023 --> 01:14:14.457
–Hi. Hello. Hi.
–May I help you?

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.771
I need to speak to Karen Eiffel.

01:14:16.894 --> 01:14:18.463
–I'm sorry?
–Karen Eiffel.

01:14:18.463 --> 01:14:20.865
She's one of your authors.
I need to talk to her.

01:14:20.865 --> 01:14:22.799
Well, sir, she's not here.

01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:26.304
No. No, I know. I need to find her.
I need to know where she is.

01:14:26.304 --> 01:14:27.772
We're just the publishers.

01:14:27.772 --> 01:14:32.062
Right. Of course. But there must be
a way that I can contact her.

01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:34.579
We have the address
where her fan mail is sent.

01:14:34.579 --> 01:14:36.889
No, I can't send mail. It's urgent.

01:14:37.548 --> 01:14:38.868
How do you know her?

01:14:39.917 --> 01:14:42.511
–I'm her brother.
–Her brother?

01:14:43.054 --> 01:14:46.023
–Her brother-in-law.
–She has a sister?

01:14:46.758 --> 01:14:49.090
No, I'm married to her brother.

01:14:49.994 --> 01:14:52.622
Not in this state, the one over.

01:14:54.599 --> 01:14:57.864
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

01:14:58.069 --> 01:15:00.367
No. Okay. Listen.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:07.166
I'm one of her characters. I'm new.
I'm in her new book.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:11.781
And she's going to kill me.
Not actually. But in the book.

01:15:11.983 --> 01:15:15.787
But I think it'll actually kill me
so I just need to talk to her…

01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:17.948
…and ask her to stop.

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:34.402
Hi, Harold. Nice sweater.

01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:39.177
Hi, Harold. Phones are out.

01:15:39.177 --> 01:15:41.289
Hey, Harold, 19 percent of 4632?

01:15:45.183 --> 01:15:47.447
Hey, Harold. Back from your vaca?

01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:50.052
Hey. Looking good.

01:15:50.855 --> 01:15:53.297
–He looks terrible.
–Yeah, banged up.

01:15:54.892 --> 01:15:56.961
Wherever he went,
I do not want to go.

01:15:56.961 --> 01:15:58.326
Book me not there.

01:16:01.566 --> 01:16:03.216
He's totally ignoring me.

01:16:06.471 --> 01:16:08.439
Here, look at this now.
There he goes.

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:09.957
It was good having you.

01:16:33.164 --> 01:16:36.167
–Oh, dude, the phones are out.
–Can I borrow your cell phone?

01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:38.431
–The signal's down.
–Damn it.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:41.144
–You all right?
–Dave, I need a favor.

01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:44.177
–Sure, what is it?
–Can I have some change?

01:16:47.345 --> 01:16:50.581
<i>Within moments, Harold found himself</i>
<i>running across the plaza…</i>

01:16:50.581 --> 01:16:53.815
<i>…heading for the nearest</i>
<i>pay phone.</i>

01:16:55.853 --> 01:16:57.833
<i>At last, he spotted it.</i>

01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:03.027
<i>But as Harold neared the phone,</i>
<i>he saw it was occupied…</i>

01:17:03.027 --> 01:17:06.531
<i>…by an octogenarian determined</i>
<i>to reach his daughter in Denver…</i>

01:17:06.531 --> 01:17:08.800
<i>…no matter how many quarters</i>
<i>it took.</i>

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.302
<i>Fortunately, Harold remembered</i>
<i>a bank of phones…</i>

01:17:11.302 --> 01:17:13.271
<i>…in the Sixth Street subway tunnel.</i>

01:17:13.271 --> 01:17:17.957
The baby's name isn't Mrs. Epstein.
My daughter's name is Mrs. Epstein.

01:17:34.625 --> 01:17:38.095
<i>The first phone</i>
<i>failed to give a dial tone.</i>

01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:40.097
<i>And the second</i>
<i>seemed to be splattered…</i>

01:17:40.097 --> 01:17:42.473
<i>…with a fresh batch of mucus.</i>

01:17:44.302 --> 01:17:46.571
<i>Harold dialed the third phone…</i>

01:17:46.571 --> 01:17:52.247
<i>…fervently making sure to give each</i>
<i>number key a specific forceful push.</i>

01:18:12.797 --> 01:18:14.230
Don't answer that!

01:18:14.432 --> 01:18:16.742
Didn't you say this phone never r…?

01:18:44.462 --> 01:18:46.760
–Hello?
–Is this Karen Eiffel?

01:18:46.964 --> 01:18:48.833
–Yes.
–My name is Harold Crick.

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:51.605
I believe you're writing a story
about me.

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:55.804
–I'm sorry?
–My name is Harold Crick.

01:18:56.508 --> 01:18:58.999
–Is this a joke?
<i>–No.</i>

01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:02.481
No, I work for the IRS. My name,
Miss Eiffel, is Harold Crick.

01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:06.051
<i>When I go through the files at work</i>
<i>I hear a deep and endless ocean.</i>

01:19:06.051 --> 01:19:08.918
–Oh, G…!
<i>–Miss Eiffel?</i>

01:19:09.855 --> 01:19:11.413
Hello?

01:19:11.623 --> 01:19:13.750
<i>Miss Eiffel? Hello?</i>

01:19:21.066 --> 01:19:22.260
Let him in.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.277
Hello.

01:19:36.748 --> 01:19:37.874
Hello.

01:19:39.084 --> 01:19:40.986
I'm Penny. I'm Kay's assistant.

01:19:40.986 --> 01:19:43.887
Oh, I'm Harold. Her main character.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.867
Oh, my God.

01:20:07.646 --> 01:20:09.273
Oh, my God.

01:20:10.649 --> 01:20:12.276
Oh, my God.

01:20:17.489 --> 01:20:18.751
Miss Eiffel?

01:20:19.224 --> 01:20:22.421
Your hair. Your eyes.

01:20:23.662 --> 01:20:25.220
Your fingers.

01:20:27.466 --> 01:20:29.434
Your shoes.

01:20:32.504 --> 01:20:33.698
Hello.

01:20:37.909 --> 01:20:39.900
I'm Harold Crick.

01:20:40.646 --> 01:20:42.375
I know.

01:20:44.349 --> 01:20:45.669
How did you find me?

01:20:46.618 --> 01:20:50.019
We audited you
a little more than 10 years ago…

01:20:50.222 --> 01:20:52.400
…and your number was in the file.

01:20:52.424 --> 01:20:57.054
I'm sorry,
but this is incredibly strange.

01:20:57.262 --> 01:20:58.923
You're telling me.

01:20:59.631 --> 01:21:01.743
Didn't you think you were crazy?

01:21:02.367 --> 01:21:03.857
Sort of.

01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:07.839
But then you were right
about everything. Like, everything.

01:21:07.839 --> 01:21:10.242
And then you said,
“Little did he know.”

01:21:10.242 --> 01:21:14.372
–“Little did he know”?
–Yeah. It's third-person omniscient.

01:21:15.013 --> 01:21:16.207
Jesus.

01:21:16.415 --> 01:21:20.185
Which meant it was, well, you know,
someone other than me.

01:21:20.185 --> 01:21:22.954
At least that's what
Professor Hilbert said.

01:21:22.954 --> 01:21:25.047
Professor Hilbert?

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:27.502
–Professor Jules Hilbert?
–Yeah.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.328
Yeah, he loves your books.

01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:34.164
I love his letters. I don't…

01:21:34.366 --> 01:21:36.601
So you understand
why I had to find you…

01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:39.832
…and ask you not to kill me.
–What?

01:21:40.305 --> 01:21:43.341
I mean, obviously
you haven't written the end.

01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.176
Harold…

01:21:45.377 --> 01:21:49.609
I mean, now since we've met
and you can see that I exist…

01:21:49.815 --> 01:21:51.993
…you're not gonna kill me, right?

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.347
Have you written it?

01:21:56.888 --> 01:21:58.446
I can… No.

01:21:58.657 --> 01:22:00.759
–Have you written it?
–An outline.

01:22:00.759 --> 01:22:02.828
Okay. But it's just an outline, right?

01:22:02.828 --> 01:22:04.610
–Yeah, sort of.
–“Sort of”?

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:06.364
–It's just not typed.
–“Not typed”?!

01:22:06.364 --> 01:22:08.066
–Maybe that's okay.
–What does that mean?

01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:11.670
–I'm sorry, I'm trying to write a book.
–What do you mean it's “okay”?

01:22:11.670 --> 01:22:13.905
–What do you mean you're sorry?
–Kay.

01:22:13.905 --> 01:22:15.668
Let him read it.

01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:20.273
Let him read it.

01:22:35.127 --> 01:22:37.561
–Did you find her?
–Yeah.

01:22:38.029 --> 01:22:41.362
–And?
–I may already be dead…

01:22:41.566 --> 01:22:43.363
…just not typed.

01:22:44.402 --> 01:22:45.391
Is that it?

01:22:47.439 --> 01:22:48.736
Did you read it?

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.238
I tried, but I couldn't.

01:22:52.811 --> 01:22:54.745
You have to read it.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.416
You have to tell me
what to do or what not to do.

01:22:58.416 --> 01:23:00.850
If I can avoid it…

01:23:02.254 --> 01:23:04.222
If I have a chance…

01:23:04.656 --> 01:23:06.146
Please.

01:23:12.998 --> 01:23:14.465
Okay.

01:23:15.133 --> 01:23:16.327
Okay.

01:23:55.207 --> 01:23:57.300
And here's your uniform.

01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:02.470
It's a go. Banetta's outside,
she'll assign you your locker.

01:24:03.481 --> 01:24:06.382
–And you roll.
–I'm ready.

01:25:03.642 --> 01:25:05.405
Professor Hilbert?

01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:09.543
–Hi, Harold.
–Hi.

01:25:11.483 --> 01:25:12.814
You look tired.

01:25:13.551 --> 01:25:15.849
No, no, just calm.

01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:21.156
Harold, I'm sorry.

01:25:24.864 --> 01:25:26.593
You have to die.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:28.794
What?

01:25:29.001 --> 01:25:31.492
It's her masterpiece.

01:25:33.806 --> 01:25:39.005
It's possibly the most important novel
in her already stunning career…

01:25:39.211 --> 01:25:42.874
…and it's absolutely no good
unless you die at the end.

01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:45.952
I've been over it again and again…

01:25:45.952 --> 01:25:49.581
…and I know how hard this is
for you to hear.

01:25:53.659 --> 01:25:56.924
You're asking me
to knowingly face my death?

01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:59.657
Yes.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.827
Really?

01:26:03.803 --> 01:26:05.100
Yes.

01:26:14.814 --> 01:26:19.274
I thought you'd…
I thought you'd find something.

01:26:20.419 --> 01:26:21.716
I'm sorry, Harold.

01:26:24.523 --> 01:26:29.051
Can't we just try and just see
if she can change it?

01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:31.729
–No.
–No?

01:26:31.931 --> 01:26:33.330
Harold…

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.465
…in the grand scheme
it wouldn't matter.

01:26:39.672 --> 01:26:42.470
–Yes, it would.
–No.

01:26:44.577 --> 01:26:46.545
I could change.

01:26:48.781 --> 01:26:50.908
I could quit my job.

01:26:51.117 --> 01:26:53.745
I could go away with Ana.

01:26:54.186 --> 01:26:56.780
I could be someone else.

01:26:57.623 --> 01:26:59.716
Harold, listen to me.

01:26:59.925 --> 01:27:02.325
I can't die right now.

01:27:04.864 --> 01:27:07.389
It's just really bad timing.

01:27:09.835 --> 01:27:13.333
No one wants to die, Harold,
but unfortunately we do.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.264
Harold…

01:27:16.942 --> 01:27:18.933
Harold, listen to me.

01:27:21.047 --> 01:27:24.175
Harold, you will die someday,
sometime.

01:27:24.383 --> 01:27:26.544
Heart failure at the bank.

01:27:27.053 --> 01:27:29.248
Choke on a mint.

01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:33.726
Some long, drawn-out disease
you contracted on vacation.

01:27:33.726 --> 01:27:37.457
You will die. You will absolutely die.

01:27:38.297 --> 01:27:41.755
Even if you avoid this death,
another will find you.

01:27:41.967 --> 01:27:47.803
And I guarantee that it won't be nearly
as poetic or meaningful…

01:27:48.207 --> 01:27:50.175
…as what she's written.

01:27:53.512 --> 01:27:55.343
I'm sorry…

01:27:56.549 --> 01:27:59.585
…but it's the nature of all tragedies,
Harold.

01:28:00.252 --> 01:28:04.086
The hero dies,
but the story lives on forever.

01:28:42.561 --> 01:28:47.049
–There's an empty seat right there.
–No, I wanna sit down over here.

01:29:22.468 --> 01:29:23.833
Kay?

01:29:35.414 --> 01:29:36.813
Kay?

01:29:39.451 --> 01:29:42.284
How many people
do you think I've killed?

01:29:44.356 --> 01:29:46.654
–Kay.
–How many?

01:29:47.159 --> 01:29:48.611
–I don't know.
–Eight.

01:29:49.295 --> 01:29:53.459
–Kay…
–I've killed eight people. I counted.

01:29:54.099 --> 01:29:55.828
They're fictional. Get up.

01:29:56.035 --> 01:29:58.003
Harold Crick isn't fictional.

01:29:58.437 --> 01:30:01.201
–I don't…
–He isn't fictional, Penny.

01:30:02.274 --> 01:30:06.498
Every book I've ever written ends
with someone dying. Every one.

01:30:07.112 --> 01:30:09.512
Really nice people too.

01:30:09.715 --> 01:30:13.674
The book about Helen
the schoolteacher.

01:30:14.787 --> 01:30:19.952
I killed her
the day before summer vacation.

01:30:20.726 --> 01:30:22.785
How cruel is that?

01:30:23.262 --> 01:30:26.629
And the civil engineer, Edward.

01:30:26.832 --> 01:30:28.265
The one I trapped…

01:30:28.467 --> 01:30:33.996
…with a heart attack in rush hour.

01:30:34.206 --> 01:30:36.037
I killed him.

01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:39.835
I killed…

01:30:40.913 --> 01:30:43.006
Penny, I killed them all.

01:31:16.782 --> 01:31:19.182
Miss Eiffel? Miss Eiffel?

01:31:20.486 --> 01:31:22.351
–Harold.
–Hi.

01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:25.988
–I just finished it.
–You just…

01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:29.029
Yeah, I read it all in one read
on the bus.

01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:31.556
It's lovely.

01:31:31.764 --> 01:31:34.008
I like the part about the guitars.

01:31:34.967 --> 01:31:38.835
Well, thanks, thanks. Goo…
Well, listen, I'm…

01:31:39.038 --> 01:31:43.600
No, I read it and I loved it.
And there's only one way it can end.

01:31:44.410 --> 01:31:48.147
I mean, I don't have much background
in literary anything…

01:31:48.147 --> 01:31:50.127
…but this seems simple enough.

01:31:53.119 --> 01:31:56.520
I love your book.
And I think you should finish it.

01:32:13.773 --> 01:32:15.875
<i>The night before his death…</i>

01:32:15.875 --> 01:32:20.363
<i>…Harold unsuspectingly went about</i>
<i>some usual business.</i>

01:32:21.014 --> 01:32:23.786
<i>He finished his outstanding audits.</i>

01:32:25.418 --> 01:32:28.154
<i>He made a few phone calls</i>
<i>he had been putting off.</i>

01:32:28.154 --> 01:32:31.954
Listen, does your program
have an age limit?

01:32:32.625 --> 01:32:35.133
<i>And he traveled to Ms Pascal's…</i>

01:32:35.228 --> 01:32:38.665
<i>…where she made him meat loaf</i>
<i>and chocolate pudding…</i>

01:32:38.665 --> 01:32:41.327
<i>…and the two watched old movies.</i>

01:32:43.103 --> 01:32:44.938
<i>It was a nice enough evening.</i>

01:32:44.938 --> 01:32:49.442
<i>And in any other circumstance</i>
<i>it would've seemed commonplace.</i>

01:32:49.442 --> 01:32:53.046
<i>In fact, the only thing</i>
<i>that made this night significant…</i>

01:32:53.046 --> 01:32:55.422
<i>…was the morning it preceded.</i>

01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:03.419
I have to tell you something.

01:33:03.623 --> 01:33:04.920
You do?

01:33:05.825 --> 01:33:07.486
I do.

01:33:08.294 --> 01:33:11.388
–Is it a secret?
–Sort of.

01:33:11.598 --> 01:33:13.088
Tell me.

01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:16.769
I adore you.

01:33:19.973 --> 01:33:22.066
I adore you too.

01:33:24.778 --> 01:33:28.214
–That it?
–No.

01:33:29.416 --> 01:33:31.213
I have to tell you this.

01:33:31.418 --> 01:33:34.012
I just want you to listen carefully.

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.778
Okay.

01:33:37.123 --> 01:33:41.253
You can deduct the value
of all the food you give away…

01:33:41.461 --> 01:33:44.035
…as a charitable contribution.
–Harold.

01:33:44.197 --> 01:33:49.499
No, no, no. In fact it amounts to more
than what you're currently withholding.

01:33:49.702 --> 01:33:51.946
And it doesn't break any tax laws.

01:33:52.071 --> 01:33:56.269
Harold, the point
is to break the tax laws.

01:33:56.476 --> 01:33:59.843
I wanna make the world
a better place too, Ana.

01:34:00.814 --> 01:34:03.977
I think that means
keeping you out of jail.

01:34:07.954 --> 01:34:09.444
Okay.

01:34:10.123 --> 01:34:11.613
Okay?

01:34:11.825 --> 01:34:13.292
–Yeah.
–Okay.

01:34:13.493 --> 01:34:17.156
If you come over here…

01:34:17.363 --> 01:34:21.561
…and talk a little more tax talk
in my ear.

01:34:21.768 --> 01:34:24.100
Because I like it so much.

01:35:47.053 --> 01:35:50.990
<i>Much had changed for Harold</i>
<i>over the past few weeks:</i>

01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:53.159
<i>His attitude towards work.</i>

01:35:53.159 --> 01:35:55.491
<i>His habitual counting.</i>

01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:57.558
<i>His love life.</i>

01:36:01.734 --> 01:36:05.305
<i>But of all the transmutations</i>
<i>Harold Crick had undergone…</i>

01:36:05.305 --> 01:36:10.510
<i>…perhaps the most significant</i>
<i>was that today on his return to work…</i>

01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:14.947
<i>…he was not late</i>
<i>for the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:19.519
<i>What Harold had not understood…</i>

01:36:19.519 --> 01:36:22.121
<i>…about that Wednesday</i>
<i>four weeks prior…</i>

01:36:22.121 --> 01:36:25.091
<i>…was that the time he received from</i>
<i>his fellow commuter…</i>

01:36:25.091 --> 01:36:29.028
<i>…was, in fact, three full minutes</i>
<i>later than the actual time…</i>

01:36:29.028 --> 01:36:31.531
<i>…and, therefore, three full minutes</i>
<i>later…</i>

01:36:31.531 --> 01:36:36.877
<i>…than the time to which his watch</i>
<i>and life had been previously set.</i>

01:36:37.303 --> 01:36:39.669
<i>Not the worst of errors.</i>

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.577
<i>But if Harold had not set his watch</i>
<i>to the incorrect time…</i>

01:36:44.577 --> 01:36:48.781
<i>…Harold would have again</i>
<i>barely caught the 8:17 Kronecker bus.</i>

01:36:48.781 --> 01:36:51.117
<i>And he would not be approaching</i>
<i>the bus stop…</i>

01:36:51.117 --> 01:36:54.520
<i>…precisely at 8:14</i>
<i>this particular Friday.</i>

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:55.987
Excuse me.

01:37:00.026 --> 01:37:01.653
Harold?

01:37:03.096 --> 01:37:05.406
<i>An otherwise ignorable fact…</i>

01:37:05.765 --> 01:37:08.339
<i>…until the unthinkable occurred.</i>

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.464
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:45.571
I need for everyone
to just stay seated.

01:37:45.571 --> 01:37:47.095
Come on, son.

01:37:52.245 --> 01:37:55.048
–What happened? I didn't see him.
–It was not your fault.

01:37:55.048 --> 01:37:57.550
He was trying to help the boy.
Get your supervisor.

01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:58.936
I don't believe this.

01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:01.654
–It was all my fault, though.
–No, it wasn't.

01:38:01.654 --> 01:38:02.848
Is he okay?

01:38:03.056 --> 01:38:06.092
–It looks likes he's breathing.
–I don't think he's breathing.

01:38:06.092 --> 01:38:07.389
Oh, my God.

01:38:22.342 --> 01:38:23.502
Come in.

01:38:27.214 --> 01:38:28.272
Excuse me.

01:38:32.052 --> 01:38:34.282
Are you Professor Hilbert?

01:38:35.989 --> 01:38:37.422
Yes.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.151
Hi. I'm Karen Eiffel.

01:38:42.963 --> 01:38:47.366
I believe we have
a mutual acquaintance.

01:38:48.836 --> 01:38:51.031
Please, sit down.

01:38:51.972 --> 01:38:54.497
No, I just came by to…

01:38:55.576 --> 01:38:56.941
Here.

01:39:00.314 --> 01:39:03.181
–Is that it?
–Yes.

01:39:04.051 --> 01:39:05.746
Have you read it?

01:39:07.387 --> 01:39:09.082
Is that all right?

01:39:12.593 --> 01:39:14.117
Yes.

01:39:16.663 --> 01:39:21.600
I think, perhaps, you may be
interested in the new ending.

01:39:34.114 --> 01:39:35.979
Good afternoon.

01:39:36.917 --> 01:39:38.646
Oh, hi.

01:39:39.286 --> 01:39:41.584
It's a pretty brave thing you did.

01:39:44.658 --> 01:39:47.760
Stepping in front of that bus
was pretty brave.

01:39:49.296 --> 01:39:51.958
Kind of stupid, but pretty brave.

01:39:52.166 --> 01:39:53.895
Oh, yeah.

01:39:54.835 --> 01:39:56.462
Is that boy okay?

01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:59.046
He's just fine. Scratched up is all.

01:39:59.106 --> 01:40:00.733
Oh, good.

01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:04.734
Am I okay?

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:07.544
Well, you're not dead.

01:40:07.748 --> 01:40:10.751
On the other hand, it looks like
you cracked your head…

01:40:10.751 --> 01:40:13.153
…you broke three bones
in your leg and foot…

01:40:13.153 --> 01:40:16.056
…you suffered four broken ribs,
fractured your left arm…

01:40:16.056 --> 01:40:20.160
…and severed an artery in your right,
which should've killed you in minutes.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.354
But amazingly…

01:40:21.562 --> 01:40:24.498
…a shard of metal from your watch
obstructed the artery…

01:40:24.498 --> 01:40:27.634
…keeping the blood loss
low enough to keep you alive…

01:40:27.634 --> 01:40:29.101
…which is pretty cool.

01:40:30.437 --> 01:40:32.813
Yeah.
So with some physical therapy…

01:40:32.906 --> 01:40:35.678
…a few months of rest,
you should be fine.

01:40:35.976 --> 01:40:39.313
Well, sort of. We weren't able
to remove the shard of watch…

01:40:39.313 --> 01:40:42.416
…from your arm without risking
severe arterial damage.

01:40:42.416 --> 01:40:44.918
You'll be okay.
You'll just have a piece of watch…

01:40:44.918 --> 01:40:47.821
…embedded in your arm
the rest of your life.

01:40:47.821 --> 01:40:50.654
You're very lucky to be alive,
Mr Crick.

01:40:51.592 --> 01:40:52.559
Yeah.

01:40:56.797 --> 01:41:00.164
–Dr Mercator, Mr Crick has a visitor.
–Sure.

01:41:01.201 --> 01:41:04.728
–My God, Harold.
–Hey.

01:41:07.441 --> 01:41:10.205
–I'm okay. It's all right.
–Harold.

01:41:10.410 --> 01:41:11.900
I'm fine.

01:41:12.112 --> 01:41:14.706
Harold, you're not fine.

01:41:14.915 --> 01:41:18.316
Look at you. You're severely injured.

01:41:18.518 --> 01:41:21.487
–No, I'm fine.
–What…? What happened?

01:41:22.656 --> 01:41:24.491
I stepped in front of a bus.

01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:27.289
What? Why?

01:41:27.494 --> 01:41:31.123
There was a boy.
I had to push him out of the way.

01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:33.390
What?

01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:37.532
I had to keep this boy from getting hit.

01:41:40.941 --> 01:41:44.307
You stepped in front of a bus
to save a little boy?

01:41:44.945 --> 01:41:47.038
I didn't have a choice.

01:41:47.247 --> 01:41:48.874
I had to.

01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:06.424
It's… It's okay.

01:42:07.734 --> 01:42:10.430
–It's not great.
–No.

01:42:10.637 --> 01:42:13.071
It's okay. It's not bad.

01:42:13.507 --> 01:42:17.044
It's not the most amazing piece
of English literature in several years…

01:42:17.044 --> 01:42:19.376
…but it's okay.

01:42:21.448 --> 01:42:22.415
You know…

01:42:24.885 --> 01:42:27.183
…I think I'm fine with “okay.”

01:42:27.387 --> 01:42:30.123
It doesn't make sense
with the rest of the book though.

01:42:30.123 --> 01:42:32.717
No, not yet. I'll rewrite the rest.

01:42:32.926 --> 01:42:35.462
My assistant said
she'd go back to the publisher…

01:42:35.462 --> 01:42:37.987
…and request more time.
–Why?

01:42:38.432 --> 01:42:40.300
Don't know. It's awfully sweet though.

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.768
No, why did you change the book?

01:42:45.205 --> 01:42:46.729
Lots of reasons.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.670
I realized I just couldn't do it.

01:42:50.978 --> 01:42:52.946
Because he's real?

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.244
Because it's a book about a man…

01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:59.653
…who doesn't know he's about to die
and then dies.

01:42:59.653 --> 01:43:03.547
But if the man does know
he's going to die and dies anyway…

01:43:03.557 --> 01:43:06.725
…dies willingly,
knowing he could stop it, then…

01:43:07.828 --> 01:43:11.821
I mean, isn't that the type of man
you want to keep alive?

01:43:14.167 --> 01:43:17.204
<i>As Harold took a bite</i>
<i>of Bavarian sugar cookie…</i>

01:43:17.204 --> 01:43:21.758
<i>…he finally felt as if everything</i>
<i>was going to be okay.</i>

01:43:22.209 --> 01:43:25.979
<i>Sometimes, when we lose ourselves</i>
<i>in fear and despair…</i>

01:43:25.979 --> 01:43:28.379
<i>…in routine and constancy…</i>

01:43:29.483 --> 01:43:31.859
<i>…in hopelessness and tragedy…</i>

01:43:32.252 --> 01:43:36.146
<i>…we can thank God</i>
<i>for Bavarian sugar cookies.</i>

01:43:36.556 --> 01:43:39.493
<i>And fortunately,</i>
<i>when there aren't any cookies…</i>

01:43:39.493 --> 01:43:44.509
<i>…we can still find reassurance</i>
<i>in a familiar hand on our skin…</i>

01:43:45.565 --> 01:43:48.007
<i>…or a kind and loving gesture…</i>

01:43:51.371 --> 01:43:53.615
<i>…or a subtle encouragement…</i>

01:43:57.144 --> 01:43:59.476
<i>…or a loving embrace…</i>

01:44:01.748 --> 01:44:04.581
<i>…or an offer of comfort.</i>

01:44:05.352 --> 01:44:09.083
<i>Not to mention hospital gurneys…</i>

01:44:11.058 --> 01:44:13.185
<i>…and nose plugs…</i>

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:22.266
<i>…and uneaten Danish…</i>

01:44:24.371 --> 01:44:26.498
<i>…and soft-spoken secrets…</i>

01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:33.243
<i>…and Fender Stratocasters…</i>

01:44:33.914 --> 01:44:38.578
<i>…and maybe the occasional piece</i>
<i>of fiction.</i>

01:44:39.686 --> 01:44:42.189
<i>And we must remember</i>
<i>that all these things…</i>

01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:44.558
<i>…the nuances, the anomalies,</i>
<i>the subtleties…</i>

01:44:44.558 --> 01:44:46.827
<i>…which we assume</i>
<i>only accessorize our days…</i>

01:44:46.827 --> 01:44:51.381
<i>…are, in fact, here for a much larger</i>

01:44:51.466 --> 01:44:54.663
<i>They are here to save our lives.</i>

01:44:55.303 --> 01:44:57.897
<i>I know the idea seems strange.</i>

01:44:58.106 --> 01:45:02.396
<i>But I also know that it</i>
<i>just so happens to be true.</i>

01:45:02.710 --> 01:45:04.143
<i>And so it was:</i>
