14:22.571 --> 14:23.906
Wander, wait for me.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.492
-What's your hurry, Becks?
-Oh, gross.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.879
(LAUGHS MANICALLY)

14:38.962 --> 14:44.551
Despair, citizens of Cluckon!
Your inevitable domination is... Gaaaah!

14:45.260 --> 14:49.139
Aw, gross! Peepers, I can see
their nuggets.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.358
Ah, finally. A villain I can sink my fists
into!

14:59.441 --> 15:00.442
Not so fast.

15:00.567 --> 15:05.447
Oh, come on, it's Lord Hater.
He's like the definition of bad guy.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.824
(WHOOSHES)

15:07.908 --> 15:10.827
-Go away!
-And yet, he's small potatoes in

15:10.911 --> 15:13.997
the baneful broth of the real villain's
gumbo of repugnance.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.916
Gumbo of... Okay, that's it.

15:15.999 --> 15:20.087
I am sick of the grim and gritty routine
and getting dragged across the galaxy

15:20.170 --> 15:23.715
for some missing pillows,
frilly scarves and pluck Cluckons.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.467
It's not that big a deal.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.762
I'm not moving until you tell me who we're
up against.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.389
(A VERY LOUD SOUND)

15:30.931 --> 15:31.932
Him.

15:32.140 --> 15:37.980
SCREWBALL: Attention, galaxy! My foul plan
is almost complete!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.694
(PILLOW BLOWING)

15:43.819 --> 15:49.783
Prepare to face the wrath of the
mischivieous, Dr. Screwball Jones.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.374
Now, tremble in eggs-cruciating terror

15:57.499 --> 16:00.294
as my latest plot leaves you
shell-shocked.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.715
Behold, my fantabulously fantabulous
tickle machine!

16:08.010 --> 16:11.930
This joker is who you think is the most
dangerous villain in the galaxy?

16:12.014 --> 16:14.975
-He what?
-Of course, he stole all those feathers in

16:15.058 --> 16:17.769
order to create a weapon
that would make everyone laugh

16:17.853 --> 16:20.147
thus, forcing the universe to be happy.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.107
Isn't that like your whole deal?

16:22.191 --> 16:25.485
I only present the positive path.
I don't force you to follow it.

16:25.986 --> 16:30.616
(TICKLE MACHINE FIRES)

16:35.954 --> 16:40.584
This... is kinda fun. In a baby
way. Ha-ha!

16:41.084 --> 16:43.086
Okay, I get it.
(LAUGHS)

16:43.170 --> 16:47.674
(CHICKENS LAUGHING)

16:47.758 --> 16:52.054
That's enough. All right, it's getting
annoying. Quit it. (LAUGHS)

16:52.137 --> 16:53.847
Okay. Stop, stop!

16:54.097 --> 16:55.098
(LAUGHING)

16:55.224 --> 16:59.895
Please make it stop! This is the worst
thing that's ever... (LAUGHING)

16:59.978 --> 17:01.396
happened to me.

17:01.522 --> 17:05.150
(LAUGHING)

17:07.736 --> 17:11.573
I guess this is no laughing matter.
Get it? Because of the... Great,

17:11.657 --> 17:12.950
now he's got me doing it.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.164
(LAUGHS)

17:21.291 --> 17:23.794
Hey, chuckles. I got a punch line for you.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.796
Then you'll need a setup.

17:25.963 --> 17:27.881
What's worse than a tickle machine?

17:27.965 --> 17:31.969
-Literally, anything.
-Wrong. 2 tickle machines.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.223
Ah, please. Too bad. I'm not ticklish.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.600
Except for behind my knees.

17:38.684 --> 17:39.768
(LAUGHS)

17:39.852 --> 17:43.939
Holy somatosense, Wander!
This is awful! He is a monster!

17:50.863 --> 17:53.115
-Knock knock.
-Who's there?

17:53.198 --> 17:55.534
-Orange.
-Orange who?

17:56.285 --> 17:58.745
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?

18:03.792 --> 18:07.337
No need to split, you might find
this a-peeling

18:07.421 --> 18:10.465
Get it? 'Cause you said banana back there.

18:13.677 --> 18:15.387
What's the matter? Seeing stars?

18:15.721 --> 18:18.640
Your noxious novelty nightmare is
over, Dr. Jones.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.642
Why do you continue to resist me?

18:20.726 --> 18:25.230
After all, we both want to spread joy
throughout the universe.

18:26.356 --> 18:32.988
(ACCORDIAN PLAYING)

18:33.530 --> 18:36.116
(SINGING) Hey there, let's have some fun.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.160
Join my good-time gang

18:38.243 --> 18:43.624
And just one question first
Rhubarb or meringue?

18:43.874 --> 18:48.420
We'll make folks happy through the land
Have them howling on their knees

18:49.046 --> 18:54.718
So, my little orange friend
Lend a hand if you please

18:55.427 --> 19:00.140
Hey, don't look so shocked
Ain't it 'bout the time

19:00.224 --> 19:06.522
To let the pun fit the crime? Ha ha!

19:07.564 --> 19:09.691
Screwball, you try too hard.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.569
Dr. Screwball, if you please,
I've got an online PhD!

19:12.653 --> 19:15.072
Folks should be free to find their
own happiness.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.033
-You can't force 'em to have fun.
-Sure I can. Watch this.

19:19.910 --> 19:20.911
Accordian!

19:22.829 --> 19:23.830
(ACCORDIAN FIRING)

19:29.545 --> 19:30.671
Banjo retort!

19:35.884 --> 19:38.554
(BANJO FIRES)

19:40.639 --> 19:42.641
You're pretty good

19:42.724 --> 19:45.269
(SINGING) But I think that we both know

19:45.435 --> 19:50.274
It's time to let my Sylvia go!

19:50.357 --> 19:51.358
Never!

20:03.912 --> 20:06.081
SCREWBALL (SINGING): String break.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.791
Here's a joke
How are you

20:08.125 --> 20:09.668
Just like a lollipop stick

20:09.751 --> 20:12.713
In the end, you're both worn down
by the force of my licks!

20:12.796 --> 20:15.132
Ha! Ha! Ha Ha Ha!

20:15.215 --> 20:17.217
Ain't it a laugh
Ha ha ha ha

20:17.509 --> 20:19.720
Looks like the end of the line

20:19.928 --> 20:22.181
So let

20:22.264 --> 20:24.391
the pun

20:24.975 --> 20:31.857
fit the

20:32.816 --> 20:34.151
crime.

20:34.484 --> 20:38.572
Wait, I've got one
last pun for you.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.532
Ooh! Ooh! Let me guess.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.452
You're ending on a sour note.
(LAUGHING)

20:44.077 --> 20:48.749
You snapped your C-sharp,
so now you'll B-flat? Ha ha!

20:49.166 --> 20:52.002
How about who's laughing now?

20:55.255 --> 20:58.842
(LAUGHING)

21:06.099 --> 21:07.100
This isn't funny!

21:08.143 --> 21:10.020
I mean, it's kinda ironic, I guess.

21:12.981 --> 21:17.319
Curse you, Wander!

21:23.575 --> 21:26.161
(ALL CHEERING)

21:28.664 --> 21:31.166
-Boy! What a Super Day!
-Buddy,

21:31.250 --> 21:34.419
from now on, if you say something's
dangerous, I'll believe you.

21:34.503 --> 21:38.257
Even if that was the stupidest danger
we've ever been in.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.675
What just happened?

21:39.758 --> 21:43.720
Well, sir, looks like once again
the day is saved thanks to,

21:43.804 --> 21:45.222
Wander and Sylvia.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.348
HATER: Meh.

21:48.392 --> 21:51.979
Now tremble in
eggs-cruciating terr...

21:52.521 --> 21:56.441
As my latest plot leaves
you shell shocked.

21:56.525 --> 21:58.569
Yeah. Oh, I am so good.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.487
I am so good.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.489
Oh, this is gold.
