00:14.348 --> 00:20.270
In the five days following Katrina,
the conditions in that hospital--

00:20.354 --> 00:22.564
In all my years of medicine...

00:24.358 --> 00:27.569
I've never seen anything like that, ever.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.154
So, are you saying that

00:29.238 --> 00:31.615
the conditions are the reason
why 45 people ended up dead?

00:31.615 --> 00:34.785
No, no, no, no.
It wasn't just the conditions.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.330
It's not that simple.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.835
Well, then maybe you can explain.

00:44.336 --> 00:49.258
Well, in those conditions, and
perhaps because of those conditions,

00:51.093 --> 00:56.723
decisions got made
that never should have been made.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.811
And we should get to that.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.695
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:12.489 --> 01:17.244
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:23.125
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:23.125 --> 01:28.422
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

01:28.422 --> 01:33.093
<i>Wade in the water</i>

01:33.177 --> 01:38.473
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

01:38.557 --> 01:42.561
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

01:43.520 --> 01:48.442
<i>Man went down to the river, Lord</i>

01:48.442 --> 01:52.696
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:57.201
<i>Went down there for to pray</i>

01:57.743 --> 01:58.744
<i>Oh</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:02.664
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:03.916 --> 02:08.753
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

02:10.339 --> 02:12.716
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:13.425 --> 02:18.430
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

02:23.560 --> 02:30.817
<i>God's gonna trouble these waters</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:38.951
<i>We are still just beginning
to learn the extent</i>

02:38.951 --> 02:43.330
<i>of the death and the damage in
the worst natural disaster in US history.</i>

02:43.330 --> 02:45.415
<i>Final death toll
may not be known for days,</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.334
<i>but it could be in the thousands.</i>
-Please.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.086
<i>The neediest patients
are being airlifted out.</i>

02:49.086 --> 02:50.921
We got the baby up to the helipad,

02:50.921 --> 02:53.257
and I flew with her
in a helicopter over to Baton Rouge.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.926
<i>Conditions worsen for those
who took shelter at the Superdome.</i>

02:55.926 --> 02:58.303
<i>We haven't eaten in, like, five days.</i>

02:58.387 --> 03:00.973
It was worse than prison. At least
in prison you got somewhere to urinate,

03:00.973 --> 03:03.016
<i>and other bathroom needs.
Here, you had nothing.</i>

03:03.100 --> 03:05.185
This woman here has lost her two children.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.311
<i>She don't know where they're at.</i>

03:06.395 --> 03:08.772
<i>They don't know if she--
if they're alive or dead.</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:10.107
<i>Mr. President...</i>
-<i>Last question.</i>

03:10.107 --> 03:11.191
<i>...this is two weeks in.</i>

03:11.275 --> 03:13.402
<i>You must have developed
a clear image at this point</i>

03:13.402 --> 03:16.572
of one critical thing
that went wrong in the first five days.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.699
Oh, I think there'll be plenty of time
to analyze,

03:18.699 --> 03:23.912
particularly, the structure of the
relationship between government levels.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.666
<i>What I think Congress needs to--
I know Congress needs to do,</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:29.042
<i>and we're doing this internally as well,</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:31.879
is to take a sober look at
the decision-making that went on.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.589
<i>Mr. President,
can I just clarify one thing?</i>

03:33.589 --> 03:34.756
No. Okay, thank you.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.864
You're from New Orleans, right?

03:59.448 --> 04:01.950
Well, a-actually, Baton Rouge.
About an hour away.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.327
How was the storm there?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.829
Well, it's nothing like New Orleans, but...

04:06.788 --> 04:10.083
Well, apart from the smoking,
you're in good shape.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.668
I can't find anything wrong.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.339
All right. Thanks, Doc.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.567
All done.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.152
Hi, sir.
-Hi.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.697
We found some photos when
we were vacuuming under the seats.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.243
Put 'em on the passenger seat for you.
-Oh, all right. Great. Here you go.

04:44.243 --> 04:46.328
Thank you, sir.
-Here. Take double.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.654
Butch.
-Hey.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.490
Can I get you something to drink?
-Oh, no, I'm good, Emma. Thank you, dear.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.328
Fellas, how are you?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.299
So what'd he say?

05:41.049 --> 05:44.178
Well, there's nothing wrong with me.
Apparently.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.471
Well, that's good.

05:47.723 --> 05:51.935
Hey... how about just you
and me go out to dinner tonight?

05:56.481 --> 06:01.195
Butch... I think I'd just rather
stay with the family, if that's okay?

06:08.577 --> 06:09.786
Hey, whatever you want.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.624
What is the plan here?

06:14.875 --> 06:19.379
Well, you got your choice
of eight different casseroles.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.715
Shit.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.718
Oh, God. One-- One second, Lin.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.055
Arthur Schafer.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.057
Yeah, I'll hold.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.851
Yes, sir.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.521
Thank you, sir.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.064
We're--

06:38.232 --> 06:40.067
We're doing okay. Yep.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.402
Well, I appreciate that.

06:46.281 --> 06:52.579
Well, I-I'm in Atlanta with my family,
but I can meet you the day after tomorrow?

06:52.663 --> 06:55.207
Is it-- No, no, that's no problem.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.961
All right. Okay, well, see you then.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.165
Yes, sir.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.168
The attorney general will see you now.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.335
Thank you.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.264
Butch. Good to see you.
-You too, sir.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.392
So, how are you holding up?

07:56.310 --> 08:00.480
Oh, you know. About as good as
could be expected. But depends on the day.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.775
I do know.
My own father passed in May. He was 92.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.069
Took care of him till the very end.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.281
I know it's not the same thing, but...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.158
Yeah.

08:12.951 --> 08:13.952
Anyway.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.496
For the two weeks since the storm,

08:16.580 --> 08:19.416
all that's been on television
are endless stories,

08:19.416 --> 08:24.004
horror stories, about abuses that
took place under the color of authority.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.341
Now, I'm interested
in looking into what happened.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.886
Seems like there was a gross dereliction
of duty across the board.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.847
In particular, I wanna take a look at what
happened at Memorial Medical Center.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.393
They found 45 dead bodies there, you know?

08:38.477 --> 08:41.104
Yeah, I heard that.
-More than anywhere else.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.398
Forty-five dead patients.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.526
Now, does that make any sense to you?

08:46.193 --> 08:49.821
Maybe a-at a hospital that size,
you know, given the conditions,

08:49.905 --> 08:52.157
maybe 45 patients just succumbed.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.078
Maybe they didn't.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.252
Is this the office of the general counsel?

09:03.252 --> 09:04.378
<i>Yes.</i>
-Hi.

09:04.378 --> 09:08.298
This is Arthur Schafer with
the Louisiana State Medicaid Fraud Unit.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.134
Are you the Tenet general counsel?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.303
<i>No, but I'm an attorney at that office.</i>

09:13.387 --> 09:16.014
All right, and your name is?
-<i>Bowers. Jim Bowers.</i>

09:16.098 --> 09:17.599
Mr. Bowers.

09:17.683 --> 09:21.353
We're looking into what happened at
Memorial Hospital during the hurricane,

09:21.353 --> 09:24.773
and we'd like to get a list from you
of all the deceased patients,

09:24.857 --> 09:27.484
plus a copy of your disaster plan.

09:27.568 --> 09:32.114
<i>Okay. Before we--
Can you explain your intentions here?</i>

09:32.823 --> 09:36.952
Well, our understanding is that
45 patients died at your hospital

09:36.952 --> 09:41.790
during the hurricane and in the aftermath,
and we need to understand what happened.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.296
Are you aware of that? These deaths?

09:47.296 --> 09:48.422
<i>Mr. Schafer,</i>

09:48.422 --> 09:51.133
<i>I'd appreciate it if you could put
whatever questions you have for us,</i>

09:51.133 --> 09:53.177
<i>if you could send us those in writing.</i>

09:53.177 --> 09:54.344
In writing?

09:55.971 --> 09:59.141
Okay.
But you do have the records?

09:59.141 --> 10:02.144
<i>As I said, please put it all
in writing, and we'll respond.</i>

10:02.144 --> 10:04.229
Well, when can we expect you to respond?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.399
<i>As soon as we can.</i>

10:07.399 --> 10:09.776
<i>I'm sorry, I've got another call.
Thank you.</i>

10:21.663 --> 10:23.582
Virginia.
-Butch.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.044
Hey! Thanks for making the time.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.755
So, how's Kevin?

10:29.755 --> 10:33.050
He's good. Thinks I work too much,
which, of course, is true.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.677
Yeah.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.933
I was very sorry to hear about Shelly.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.519
Can't even imagine.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.521
Thanks.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.357
How are you and Linda doing?

10:48.357 --> 10:52.819
Well, she's still with her family
out in Atlanta, and... it's...

10:53.946 --> 10:57.699
Man, it's hard.
You know, it comes and goes in waves.

10:57.783 --> 11:01.078
I'm really glad to be back
at work, have some place to put my focus.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.162
Yeah.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.083
How about you?
How are all the fraudsters?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.628
Oh, you know, they're still out there,
stealing away a nickel at a time.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.171
Till they run up against you.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.633
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
'Cause people lie, but numbers never do.

11:19.263 --> 11:23.350
So, Charles Foti,
he's asked me to look into the--

11:23.350 --> 11:26.144
the deaths at
Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.564
I read about that. Forty-five dead bodies?

11:28.564 --> 11:31.692
Yeah. Our office, we have
to characterize each of these deaths.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.026
It's gonna be a lot of work.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.696
Just finding the people who are scattered
everywhere after the storm

11:35.696 --> 11:36.822
is gonna be a nightmare.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.323
You're viewing these as crimes?

11:39.491 --> 11:42.411
It's a lot of deaths,
but you have to look at the conditions.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.454
I mean, things were pretty horrific.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.583
Can you imagine being a doctor or nurse
in the middle of all that?

11:47.583 --> 11:49.877
What they did, that was incredible.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.003
Yeah, I agree.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.965
But there's a couple of things
that are wonky here.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.509
So, I called this attorney at Tenet.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.387
They're the ones who own the place,
you know, changed the name from "Baptist."

12:00.387 --> 12:04.224
Just a routine information request,
but he starts giving me the runaround.

12:04.308 --> 12:07.561
Says I have to fax him all
of my requests in writing,

12:07.561 --> 12:09.438
and then he faxes me back
all this other stuff.

12:09.438 --> 12:13.859
Corporate statement. Articles about
the heroism of the medical workers.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.989
And then he says that he can't locate
any of the medical records

12:18.989 --> 12:20.282
that I asked him for.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.659
And then I get this over the transom.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.412
It's a--
It's from a LifeCare attorney.

12:25.412 --> 12:29.833
Now, LifeCare's this-- this company
that runs a facility inside Memorial,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.044
so this hospital within a hospital, so...

12:32.669 --> 12:36.131
"Although we are just beginning
to collect the relevant facts,

12:36.215 --> 12:38.050
we have information that the patients..."

12:38.050 --> 12:41.887
meaning, their patients who died,
the LifeCare patients, right,

12:41.887 --> 12:46.725
"...were administered morphine
by the physician Dr. Anna Pou,

12:46.725 --> 12:50.020
whom we believe is not an employee
of LifeCare,

12:50.020 --> 12:54.525
at a time when it appeared the patients
could not be successfully evacuated."

12:54.525 --> 12:58.028
So they're suggesting that some of their
patients' lives may have been ended?

12:58.904 --> 12:59.947
Who's this Dr. Pou?

13:00.656 --> 13:02.658
I don't know yet.
-Well, we need to find her.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.368
I'd assume she was working at Memorial.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.579
And it'd be very helpful to get ahold
of those LifeCare patient records.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.083
Now, Virginia,
I know you're a forensic accountant,

13:11.083 --> 13:13.836
and this may be a little broader than
the normal scope of your cases,

13:13.836 --> 13:17.297
but, man,
I need your analytical mind on this.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.092
This is like a-- like a jigsaw puzzle
with a thousand pieces

13:20.092 --> 13:22.344
that are all the same color.
-Then get chewed up by the dog.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.680
Exactly. So, I was hoping that--

13:25.472 --> 13:29.476
Man, I would love it, in fact, if you
would be willing to work on this with me.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.146
Isn't that what we're doing?

13:41.864 --> 13:46.118
How'd y'all survive the storm?
You and your husband. Your house is okay?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.579
We live uptown on high ground.

13:48.579 --> 13:53.458
You know, one block was dry, one block
was underwater, but we got lucky.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.085
That's great to hear.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.130
So, Anna...

14:00.799 --> 14:03.886
given that Memorial's not gonna
be reopening any time soon,

14:05.929 --> 14:09.349
we would love it
if you would consider joining us at LSU.

14:09.975 --> 14:14.021
That is, if you wouldn't mind spending
a few nights a week up in Baton Rouge.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.694
I'd commute to Tennessee
if it meant getting back to work.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.488
Well, we're closer than that,
and we have a better football team.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.240
True. That's true.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.869
Hell, we all think you're one of
the best surgeons in the entire state.

14:29.745 --> 14:30.954
Thank you for saying that.

14:31.038 --> 14:34.708
So, when things settle down in a couple
of months, we can talk about it.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.587
No. I'm saying yes.
I'm ready to start now.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.172
You are?

14:40.172 --> 14:44.510
Yes. Sure. Yes, I wanna get back to work.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.512
Well, that is beyond what I...

14:48.472 --> 14:52.434
That is wonderful.
-Good.

14:54.436 --> 14:58.106
Ch-Cheers to that. I am thrilled.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.318
Thank you. I'm thrilled too.

15:07.616 --> 15:11.453
Good morning, y'all.
I'm Callie Fredricks from Tenet.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.580
Thanks for coming all the way out here
to go to work today

15:13.664 --> 15:15.415
and for joining our call team.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.876
Okay, so,
on the table here are your face sheets,

15:17.960 --> 15:20.003
one for each of the deceased patients.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.923
Your names are on
the ones you've been assigned.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.925
You all got your
calling instruction packets, right?

15:24.925 --> 15:26.134
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.678
Okay, so, just to reiterate,

15:27.678 --> 15:30.764
only speak in general terms,
never give an opinion.

15:30.848 --> 15:34.393
The loved ones are usually angry,
and that's not surprising.

15:34.393 --> 15:37.437
Most of 'em have no information yet
about their loved ones,

15:37.521 --> 15:39.064
only what they've seen on the news.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.524
Excuse me.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.902
No one from Tenet has spoken
to any of the family members?

15:43.986 --> 15:45.821
They may have tried to call in,

15:45.821 --> 15:48.448
but no one's had the information
to give them yet, no.

15:49.032 --> 15:53.495
So, most importantly,
just tell the family members the truth.

15:53.579 --> 15:58.083
That the patients may have died due to
lack of electricity or high temperatures.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.044
Okay? Okay.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.841
This is Susan Mulderick.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.969
I am a supervisor
at Memorial Medical Center,

16:08.969 --> 16:12.556
and I'm calling about your mother,
Shirley Broussard.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.893
<i>Finally. I've been trying to reach anyone.</i>

16:15.893 --> 16:17.811
Unfortunately, Miss Broussard,

16:17.895 --> 16:23.650
I am very sorry to say that your mother
died at the hospital

16:23.734 --> 16:28.405
between the hurricane and the evacuation
of patients from the facility.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.034
<i>I had this weird hope that maybe she was...</i>

16:33.035 --> 16:34.077
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

16:35.954 --> 16:37.873
I'm so sorry this took two weeks.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.043
"Your loved one was cared for throughout."

16:42.044 --> 16:47.758
"Your loved one was identified and
shrouded, and placed in our chapel area."

16:49.134 --> 16:52.596
"Your loved one was treated with dignity."

16:52.596 --> 16:53.847
<i>I don't understand.</i>

16:53.931 --> 16:56.683
<i>Why wasn't she evacuated
ahead of the storm?</i>

16:58.644 --> 17:01.396
That was based on
the risk to the patient.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.650
<i>Other patients got out.</i>

17:06.359 --> 17:07.569
<i>What was her risk?</i>

17:08.904 --> 17:12.074
I'm sorry. I-I don't have
that specific information.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.910
The state retrieved your loved one

17:14.992 --> 17:17.496
and brought him to
the parish coroner's office.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.625
The cause of death will be identified,
and a...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.627
death certificate will be made available.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.714
State officials will then contact you.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.800
I am very sorry.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.385
We are so sorry.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.303
Goodbye.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.721
Okay. Goodbye.

17:48.861 --> 17:51.738
<i>There was some patients there that...</i>

17:53.782 --> 17:55.534
<i>were critically ill,</i>

17:55.534 --> 18:01.415
<i>and regardless of the storm, had--
had the orders of "do not resuscitate."</i>

18:01.415 --> 18:04.793
<i>In other words, if they died,
to allow them to die naturally,</i>

18:04.877 --> 18:10.799
<i>and not to use any heroic mes--
methods to resuscitate them.</i>

18:12.342 --> 18:15.095
<i>We all did everything we could
within our power</i>

18:15.179 --> 18:19.224
<i>to give the best treatment
to the patients in the hospital</i>

18:19.850 --> 18:21.351
<i>and make them comfortable.</i>

18:21.435 --> 18:23.270
Yeah, she comes across very well.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.647
Maybe a little too well.

18:26.231 --> 18:29.693
Didn't she seem a little unemotional
just a few days after all those deaths?

18:29.693 --> 18:32.696
She's a doctor.
She's just being professional.

18:33.447 --> 18:38.035
Well, this notion that doctors and nurses
would intentionally kill their patients,

18:38.035 --> 18:39.411
that just seems nuts.

18:39.411 --> 18:42.581
Yeah. I did follow up with Tenet
about getting those medical records.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.665
And?

18:43.749 --> 18:45.584
They were nothing but vague
about where they are.

18:45.584 --> 18:49.046
Well, maybe we need to subpoena them,
or at least threaten that.

18:49.046 --> 18:51.340
I got a better idea.
-What's that?

18:51.340 --> 18:53.842
Why don't we drive down to New Orleans
and go to Memorial?

18:53.926 --> 18:55.802
Don't you wanna see
the place with your own eyes?

18:55.886 --> 18:58.972
Plus, maybe we'll get lucky
and find those records ourselves.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.649
Hey. Mind if I smoke?

19:08.649 --> 19:11.527
Actually, I do.
I hate the smell on my clothes.

19:13.195 --> 19:16.114
Ah, man. Remember when you used
to be able to smoke on a plane?

19:18.242 --> 19:20.536
I remember when I was, like, 12,

19:20.536 --> 19:23.038
I was flying to California
to go to Disneyland.

19:23.038 --> 19:24.873
And I was sitting in
the no-smoking section,

19:24.957 --> 19:28.919
which was absolutely ridiculous, because I
still ingested, like, two packs of smoke.

19:28.919 --> 19:31.296
Well, at least
you were going to Disneyland.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.464
That's true.

19:34.508 --> 19:36.134
Hey, you ever think about quitting?

19:37.094 --> 19:39.596
Oh, I think about quitting all the time.

19:49.982 --> 19:50.816
Look at that.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.236
I can get to it.
Let me pull it to the top.

19:54.236 --> 19:58.866
The pictures,
they don't really do it justice, do they?

20:02.119 --> 20:03.996
It's like getting hit by a truck.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.999
You think you know what it's like,

20:06.999 --> 20:10.627
but you can't really know
unless you get hit by the truck.

20:29.730 --> 20:30.731
Can I help you?

20:30.731 --> 20:33.609
Yeah, we're investigators with
the state attorney general's office.

20:33.609 --> 20:35.444
We need to take a look around inside.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.070
That's not gonna happen.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.532
Sorry. Pardon me?
-Not without a warrant or a hazmat suit.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.869
You don't have a hazmat suit.
They don't have hazmat suits.

20:43.869 --> 20:47.039
Without a hazmat suit and a warrant,
you're not going inside.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.290
Who do y'all work for?

20:48.290 --> 20:51.001
We're under contract at Tenet.
They own this hospital.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.794
You have a supervisor?

20:52.878 --> 20:55.881
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, you wanna call him?

20:55.881 --> 20:58.091
He's just gonna tell you
the exact same thing.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.223
Well, come on. Let's go.
-Asshole.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.935
I know a good place for lunch.
It'll make it worth the drive.

21:19.488 --> 21:20.405
Hello?

21:20.489 --> 21:21.990
<i>Dr. Pou?</i>
-Yes?

21:22.074 --> 21:24.910
<i>My name is Liz Jarvis.
I'm a producer with CNN.</i>

21:24.910 --> 21:27.120
<i>We saw your interview on Channel 2.</i>

21:27.204 --> 21:30.290
<i>We hear the state's investigating
the deaths at Memorial Medical Center,</i>

21:30.374 --> 21:33.585
<i>and we want to get the medical
professionals' side of the story.</i>

21:38.006 --> 21:39.174
Hello?

21:39.258 --> 21:41.176
<i>Susan, it's Anna.</i>

21:41.927 --> 21:42.928
Hey, Anna.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.388
<i>How are you doing?</i>

21:45.222 --> 21:46.223
We're fine.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.684
You know, my husband, Vince and I,
we're-- we're good.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.230
Our house made it through,
so... we're-- we're okay.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.482
The reason I'm calling you is--

21:55.566 --> 21:58.193
Did-- Did you hear that
the state's investigating Memorial?

21:58.777 --> 22:01.321
No, I didn't hear that.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.324
<i>CNN just called me.</i>

22:04.950 --> 22:08.954
<i>They're preparing a report
on possible euthanasia at the hospital.</i>

22:10.038 --> 22:11.790
<i>They want my side of the story.</i>

22:11.874 --> 22:13.125
CNN?

22:13.125 --> 22:14.960
I'm not sure what I should do here.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.797
Well, sit tight, and I'll...

22:18.881 --> 22:21.049
I'll have someone from Tenet
give you a call.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.134
<i>Okay?</i>

22:22.718 --> 22:23.802
Okay.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.937
Yes, Robert, this is Horace.

22:34.021 --> 22:36.440
Have you heard the news
about the hospital?

22:38.650 --> 22:44.656
Yeah, well, it's about my patient,
Elena Batiste.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.034
Is she on the list of the dead?

22:53.790 --> 22:56.210
I admitted her as a precaution.

22:57.044 --> 22:58.462
Before the storm.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.882
Because she was on electrical equipment.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.678
She wasn't in any kind
of terminal distress. None.

23:07.304 --> 23:13.101
Look, after I left, wasn't Dr. Nadler
in charge of her care--

23:14.102 --> 23:16.522
Well, then who was handling her care?

23:19.399 --> 23:21.235
Well, then who does know?

23:39.211 --> 23:41.213
<i>Hello.</i>
-Ewing, it's Anna.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.507
<i>Oh, Anna. You okay?</i>
-Where are you?

23:43.507 --> 23:46.468
Well, I have decamped
to a hotel in Houston.

23:46.552 --> 23:50.055
My room has a wonderful view
of the highway and an auto mall.

23:50.806 --> 23:53.725
Did you know that state's
looking into what happened at Memorial?

23:53.809 --> 23:55.018
Have they contacted you?

23:55.102 --> 23:57.604
No, state hasn't,
but the media certainly has.

23:57.688 --> 24:00.148
Was it CNN?
They want me to do an interview.

24:00.232 --> 24:01.233
<i>Yes</i>.

24:01.233 --> 24:05.612
CNN is looking for me also, but I don't
want nothing to do with those people.

24:05.696 --> 24:06.738
Look--

24:06.822 --> 24:10.492
<i>The issue we're dealing with here
when it comes to medical ethics,</i>

24:10.576 --> 24:12.286
<i>people have opinions all over the map</i>

24:12.286 --> 24:14.121
<i>and I don't wanna be stuck
in the middle of it.</i>

24:14.121 --> 24:15.706
Then what do you suggest I do here?

24:15.706 --> 24:17.875
Oh, I'm not the person to ask.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.004
But if it was me, I'd talk to Tenet.

24:22.004 --> 24:25.007
<i>What I would not do
is talk to those media people.</i>

24:25.674 --> 24:29.970
<i>Couple of edits, they can make you
sound however they want.</i>

24:29.970 --> 24:31.513
That's exactly right.

24:31.597 --> 24:35.100
Hide. That's my advice. Hide.

24:44.902 --> 24:47.654
Hey, are you Tiana Colburn?

24:47.738 --> 24:49.114
And you are?

24:49.198 --> 24:52.201
Arthur Schafer,
with the State Medicaid Fraud Unit.

24:53.577 --> 24:54.620
How'd you find me?

24:54.620 --> 24:58.415
Your neighbor down the block
said you're up here at your mom's.

24:58.415 --> 25:00.751
You know, this block, the red door.

25:02.044 --> 25:04.004
Man, I'm sorry about all this.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.465
Man, it's all her stuff.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.634
You know, her whole life.

25:09.259 --> 25:10.260
Man, it's terrible.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.890
Well... I guess as long as we all safe.

25:15.974 --> 25:17.684
Can I ask you a few questions?

25:18.852 --> 25:20.103
Sure. Okay.

25:20.187 --> 25:22.064
You're a nurse at Memorial?

25:22.064 --> 25:25.025
I am. Well, I mean I was
before the hospital closed.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.944
Now, did you work with Dr. Anna Pou?

25:27.778 --> 25:30.531
I'm a surgical nurse
so I did a lot of her surgeries, yeah.

25:30.531 --> 25:32.574
Right. Were you with her, you know,

25:32.658 --> 25:35.244
working with her
after the hospital flooded?

25:36.078 --> 25:39.206
At first, but then I left.
Which was not my plan.

25:39.998 --> 25:43.585
I was helping one of the neonates
and ended up in a helicopter.

25:43.669 --> 25:44.753
Wait, you--

25:45.754 --> 25:47.881
I saw you on the news.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.050
You saved that baby. That was you.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.635
Oh, yeah. That was me.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.929
That was heroic.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.682
Nah--
I just did what anybody would do.

25:56.682 --> 25:59.101
No, no.
That was special what you did.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.228
Thank you.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.232
Sorry.

26:06.441 --> 26:11.488
My daughter died recently
on account of--

26:11.572 --> 26:15.701
The doctors who cared for her
had overprescribed her medications.

26:19.288 --> 26:22.416
I'm-- I'm sorry. That's-- That's terrible.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.501
Yeah, I guess
I can't help but thinking that if--

26:24.585 --> 26:28.797
that if her doctors were more like you,
she'd be alive right now.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.762
I wrote Mr. Miller
a new prescription.

26:35.846 --> 26:38.891
So if there are any changes
in his condition,

26:38.891 --> 26:41.768
will you please let me know, okay?
And just call my cell.

26:41.852 --> 26:42.853
Excuse me.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.609
Hello?
-<i>Hello. Is this Dr. Pou?</i>

26:48.609 --> 26:50.777
Yes.
-<i>This is Steven Campanini.</i>

26:50.861 --> 26:53.071
<i>I'm the communication director for Tenet.</i>

26:53.155 --> 26:55.157
<i>Are you anywhere near a landline?</i>

26:56.950 --> 26:58.493
I can go to my office.

26:58.577 --> 27:02.247
<i>Please. And call me back.
My number should be on your screen.</i>

27:08.504 --> 27:11.006
<i>Dr. Pou.</i>
-I'm on a landline.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.634
Hang on a minute.
I've got our assistant general counsel,

27:13.634 --> 27:15.844
Audrey Andrews, on the line with me.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.095
Hello, Dr. Pou.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.682
Hello.
Thank you for getting in touch.

27:20.766 --> 27:21.850
<i>Of course.</i>

27:23.936 --> 27:27.689
I understand the events at Memorial
are under investigation.

27:27.773 --> 27:29.149
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

27:30.484 --> 27:32.945
I was hoping for some
guidance and advice.

27:33.862 --> 27:38.325
Dr. Pou, it would be very helpful
if you could, from your perspective,

27:38.325 --> 27:40.077
walk us through the events
at the hospital.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.496
<i>Starting from when the hurricane hit.</i>

27:47.334 --> 27:48.335
Sure...

27:54.007 --> 28:00.013
So, we were-- we were struggling
to provide patient care, you know?

28:00.764 --> 28:04.518
There was only emergency power,
you know.

28:04.518 --> 28:09.273
There was no air-conditioning.
I can't even tell you how terrible.

28:09.273 --> 28:10.357
It was...

28:20.325 --> 28:23.662
By the end, there was just chaos.

28:23.662 --> 28:26.164
We were under mandatory evacuation.

28:26.248 --> 28:28.876
Everyone was scrambling to get out.

28:28.876 --> 28:32.921
<i>Dr. Pou, I want to zero in
a little more specifically on</i>

28:33.005 --> 28:35.716
<i>what happened on that fifth and final day.</i>

28:40.137 --> 28:42.347
Well, before we do that...

28:44.349 --> 28:46.602
I was wondering
if you could explain

28:46.602 --> 28:49.897
how you're gonna be
providing for my defense.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.357
You know, if it comes to that.

28:53.192 --> 28:55.944
<i>I can't give you any advice
on your representation.</i>

28:56.570 --> 28:57.613
Excuse me.

28:59.031 --> 29:02.242
<i>I work for Tenet.
Not for any of the individual doctors.</i>

29:03.744 --> 29:06.705
<i>In fact, I'd strongly advise you
to get your own attorney.</i>

29:07.372 --> 29:10.375
<i>Okay, now getting back to that morning,
Thursday--</i>

29:10.459 --> 29:11.460
No.

29:12.377 --> 29:13.378
No, I--

29:14.254 --> 29:16.256
I'm not gonna answer
any more of your questions

29:16.340 --> 29:18.759
before I get my own lawyers. Goodbye.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.521
<i>So, what happens next?
What do we do here?</i>

29:30.521 --> 29:35.317
<i>Well, in New Orleans, it's
a city, but really it's just a small town.</i>

29:36.527 --> 29:39.446
Everything you say and do is gonna
be observed and picked over.

29:39.530 --> 29:42.824
You can't be talking to anybody
about what went on.

29:42.908 --> 29:45.661
All right? Certainly not the media.
No more interviews--

29:45.661 --> 29:47.704
I don't want to do any more interviews.

29:47.788 --> 29:49.748
And even your husband, Vince?

29:49.748 --> 29:51.166
Yes, Vince.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.627
Even Vince is gonna have to
be kept in the dark a little bit here.

29:53.627 --> 29:58.173
What you and I talk about
is gonna just be between you and me.

29:59.842 --> 30:00.843
Understood.

30:03.470 --> 30:07.975
Look, I just want you to know one thing
before we go any further.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.935
I didn't do anything wrong.

30:09.935 --> 30:12.479
No, I know. I know that.
I know that. I--

30:14.189 --> 30:15.732
I-- I knew of your dad.

30:15.816 --> 30:19.403
He was... he was an excellent doctor.

30:19.403 --> 30:23.657
No, listen, your reputation is impeccable.

30:23.657 --> 30:26.410
So what do we do? Just sit around
and wait until it's ruined?

30:26.410 --> 30:28.954
No, we're not just gonna
sit back on defense here.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.248
Meaning?
-Leave that to me.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.750
For now, I don't want you to worry.

30:34.543 --> 30:38.046
I mean, I know you're gonna worry,
but, I promise you, Anna,

30:38.797 --> 30:40.257
I am gonna take care of you.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.682
<i>I'm curious, Mrs. Robichaux,</i>

30:48.682 --> 30:51.518
why the LifeCare lawyers
wanted you to talk to us.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.812
Because I believe...

30:55.105 --> 30:59.568
what happened-- what you're looking into,
those deaths...

31:01.778 --> 31:03.113
they weren't accidental.

31:04.907 --> 31:06.658
Do you want to tell us what happened?

31:08.827 --> 31:11.330
Well, first of all...

31:12.873 --> 31:14.917
the conditions in the hospital were...

31:16.335 --> 31:17.377
horrible.

31:19.588 --> 31:23.008
I mean, just beyond belief.

31:24.218 --> 31:25.761
<i>It was chaos.</i>

31:25.761 --> 31:28.388
You know, nobody knew what was going on.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.601
There was no power for two days.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.270
<i>It was dark.</i>

31:36.438 --> 31:39.608
The air was-- was like a furnace.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.945
The stench of death was everywhere.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.200
Especially on the last day.

31:50.494 --> 31:53.455
I was called up to a meeting at LifeCare.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.916
We're getting all the patients out
that we can.

31:55.916 --> 31:58.836
So, is-- Some people are not getting out?

31:58.836 --> 32:03.006
The plan is
to not leave any living patients behind.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.470
What about Emmett Everett?

32:09.304 --> 32:10.722
He's one of our patients.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.183
He's awake. He's alert.

32:13.267 --> 32:16.854
I'm not familiar with all your patients.
That's Dr. Pou.

32:16.854 --> 32:18.063
You should ask her.

32:19.022 --> 32:21.233
So I went over and I talked to Dr. Pou.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.693
Excuse me. I'm Diane Robichaux.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.611
I run LifeCare here at this facility.
-Hi.

32:24.695 --> 32:26.947
We were talking about Emmett.

32:26.947 --> 32:29.366
He's paralyzed. Weighs, what, 380 pounds?

32:29.366 --> 32:30.659
About.

32:30.659 --> 32:32.411
Yeah, how's he holding up?

32:32.411 --> 32:35.038
He's conscious and aware,
if that's what you mean.

32:36.707 --> 32:39.293
I didn't realize any of the patients
were aware.

32:40.252 --> 32:41.378
Yes.

32:41.378 --> 32:43.630
How many people do you think
it would take to move him?

32:43.714 --> 32:46.675
I-- I don't know.
I have no idea.

32:46.675 --> 32:49.845
We'd have to go down the stairs.
That's seven flights in the dark.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.514
<i>Across the hospital,
through the hole in the machine room.</i>

32:52.598 --> 32:55.267
And, frankly,
I don't even know if he would fit.

32:55.267 --> 32:57.978
Then he'd be driven up to the top
to the parking garage

32:57.978 --> 32:59.897
and carried up the narrow steps
to the helipad.

32:59.897 --> 33:02.399
Well--
I'm sure there's a way to do it.

33:02.399 --> 33:04.443
It has been a struggle...

33:05.736 --> 33:07.905
with people far easier to manage.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.282
I'm sorry, wh--

33:10.991 --> 33:12.868
So, what are we talking about?

33:13.660 --> 33:14.745
She said...

33:18.040 --> 33:23.670
"Some of these patients,
they're just not gonna survive."

33:27.174 --> 33:29.968
Did Dr. Pou mean
she was gonna euthanize him?

33:33.305 --> 33:35.557
The word "euthanize" was never used,

33:37.017 --> 33:41.855
but I'm fairly certain
that's what happened to him in the end.

33:43.815 --> 33:46.527
Did Dr. Pou--
Did she say what her plan was?

33:47.611 --> 33:50.113
She pulled me aside
to let me off the hook.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.282
I'm taking full responsibility
for all this.

33:52.366 --> 33:55.285
I don't want anybody
worrying about losing their license.

33:56.578 --> 33:58.247
As if that's what I cared about.

34:00.582 --> 34:01.917
What happened then?

34:03.710 --> 34:07.339
We turned the floor over to Pou
and the two nurses she had with her.

34:07.339 --> 34:09.591
Do you know who they were,
these two nurses?

34:11.552 --> 34:12.553
No.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.473
I didn't even know 'em.

34:24.940 --> 34:28.485
I believe in my heart
that my patients were killed.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.782
And even though
I didn't participate in it...

34:37.034 --> 34:38.745
I didn't do enough to stop it.

34:42.165 --> 34:43.750
So, what do you think?

34:43.750 --> 34:46.837
What I think is that she didn't actually
hear anybody

34:46.837 --> 34:48.797
directing patients to be euthanized.

34:48.797 --> 34:50.966
Could just be a case of misunderstanding.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.510
Look, given the dire circumstances,

34:53.594 --> 34:57.054
it seems likely that these
critical care patients had just died.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.892
Or at the very worst,
misprescribed medications.

34:59.892 --> 35:04.813
I just can't believe that the staff
would intentionally kill patients.

35:04.897 --> 35:06.315
I just can't fathom that.

35:06.315 --> 35:07.399
Me either.

35:08.734 --> 35:10.444
We need to talk to some more people
at LifeCare.

35:10.444 --> 35:12.404
Get a better handle on what happened.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.573
See what I can set up.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.289
PP is steady.

35:22.289 --> 35:24.333
More inferior exposure, please.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.793
Yes, Dr. Pou.
-Thank you.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.297
Significant adenopathy.
Those nodes are gonna have to go too.

35:31.006 --> 35:32.007
Noted.

35:37.721 --> 35:38.931
<i>Wake up, Allyson.</i>

35:41.892 --> 35:42.893
Wake up.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.273
Hey. How are you doing?

35:49.107 --> 35:50.234
Hey, Doc.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.361
Hi.

35:53.028 --> 35:55.239
It's good news. We got all of it out.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.536
We're sending the tissue samples
to pathology,

36:00.536 --> 36:03.497
but I don't think there's any more tumor.

36:04.623 --> 36:05.749
Are you serious?

36:08.043 --> 36:09.503
You're gonna be great.

36:10.587 --> 36:12.256
<i>Is your family out there?</i>

36:14.883 --> 36:16.009
I'll let them know.

36:26.603 --> 36:29.273
Ms. Mendez,
you were the nurse executive for LifeCare?

36:29.273 --> 36:31.358
That's right, yes.

36:31.358 --> 36:34.903
Let's jump right to
the morning of Thursday, September 1st.

36:34.987 --> 36:37.489
That was your last day
at the hospital, right?

36:37.573 --> 36:38.949
Yes, it was.

36:38.949 --> 36:40.993
What do you remember about that day?

36:44.496 --> 36:45.914
The helicopters.

36:48.834 --> 36:50.085
<i>And the smell.</i>

36:50.169 --> 36:52.921
<i>The fumes from the helipad
were wafting inside.</i>

36:53.922 --> 36:55.382
It was overwhelming.

36:57.259 --> 37:01.471
The whole thing reminded me of something
I'd seen on TV once.

37:02.222 --> 37:03.515
What was that?

37:05.851 --> 37:07.060
<i>The Fall of Saigon.</i>

37:10.147 --> 37:13.066
Ms. Johnson,
what was your job at LifeCare?

37:13.150 --> 37:15.319
And it's Kristy, yeah, with a "K"?
Is that--

37:15.319 --> 37:18.280
Yes. K-R-I-S-T-Y.

37:19.198 --> 37:22.159
I was the physical medicine director,
which means I supervised

37:22.159 --> 37:24.828
all the rehabilitation
and therapy programs at LifeCare.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.789
Can you tell us
what you remember about that last day,

37:27.873 --> 37:29.333
Thursday, at the hospital?

37:30.501 --> 37:32.544
I remember we had a meeting
with Susan Mulderick

37:32.628 --> 37:35.130
and she was saying she didn't think
the LifeCare patients were gonna make it.

37:35.214 --> 37:36.340
Mulderick said that?

37:36.924 --> 37:38.342
Yes, I think so.

37:39.301 --> 37:40.511
Do you know why?

37:41.094 --> 37:45.057
The conditions were total chaos,
and we were under orders to get out.

37:45.682 --> 37:49.061
Now, my guess is,
I don't know this for a fact,

37:50.521 --> 37:53.398
they didn't want to
leave patients alone and behind

37:53.482 --> 37:57.152
to suffer in a deserted hospital
maybe for days before they died.

37:58.529 --> 38:00.739
So, that morning, what'd you do?

38:01.657 --> 38:03.367
The first thing I always did.

38:04.409 --> 38:07.287
<i>Go check on the patients.</i>

38:12.000 --> 38:13.627
<i>They looked bad.</i>

38:14.503 --> 38:16.004
<i>Some were unconscious and...</i>

38:17.464 --> 38:19.550
<i>others were frothing at the mouth.</i>

38:21.927 --> 38:25.097
<i>Some were breathing
the way you breath before you die.</i>

38:27.641 --> 38:29.226
There was no food.

38:29.226 --> 38:30.769
No fresh water.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.398
People were just trying to get out.

38:34.398 --> 38:36.733
One. Can anybody take one?

38:36.817 --> 38:39.403
I was helping
one of my patient's daughters,

38:39.403 --> 38:41.196
Angela McManus, get onto a boat.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.449
You need to get yourself somewhere safe
for your mother, okay?

38:44.992 --> 38:46.702
You need to survive for her.

38:46.702 --> 38:48.287
That's when Dr. Pou came over...

38:48.287 --> 38:49.496
These patients...

38:51.915 --> 38:53.500
they're probably not gonna survive.

38:57.629 --> 39:00.424
I'm amazed we've kept
the sickest ones alive for this long.

39:03.802 --> 39:07.181
The decision's been made
to administer lethal doses.

39:08.182 --> 39:10.267
<i>Did she say specifically what drugs?</i>

39:10.851 --> 39:13.729
She listed them off,
but I was so shocked, I...

39:16.190 --> 39:19.526
I asked her to repeat them
and she repeated them and--

39:20.235 --> 39:21.320
Now, I don't--

39:22.613 --> 39:24.239
Morphine was one of them.

39:31.496 --> 39:32.789
What happened after that?

39:33.540 --> 39:35.751
I heard Therese Mendez calling my name.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.504
<i>She sounded really upset.</i>

39:38.504 --> 39:41.507
Kristy. Kristy, Kristy, come on.
We got to go back.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.386
<i>We went to Emmett Everett's room
because that's where Dr. Pou was.</i>

39:58.941 --> 40:01.193
There's no way we can get him out.

40:02.319 --> 40:03.695
What happened then?

40:04.530 --> 40:06.406
She wanted somebody to sedate him.

40:06.490 --> 40:08.116
You-- You heard her say that?

40:08.951 --> 40:11.662
Pou asked for someone to sedate him?

40:15.916 --> 40:17.084
Ms. Johnson.

40:20.337 --> 40:21.421
She might have.

40:21.505 --> 40:25.175
I'm not sure if I heard it
directly from her or from somebody else.

40:25.259 --> 40:26.885
But I did hear her say,

40:26.969 --> 40:31.181
"Y'all need to be evacuated.
The patients are in our care now."

40:31.723 --> 40:34.768
Did you see her do anything
to any of your patients?

40:37.604 --> 40:40.107
When I was leaving,
I saw her walking down the hall.

40:40.107 --> 40:42.442
<i>She looked really nervous to me.</i>

40:43.068 --> 40:44.695
She was with these two nurses.

40:46.572 --> 40:49.575
<i>Did you see her administer
drugs to any of the patients?</i>

40:55.205 --> 40:57.124
Did you see anything else?

40:59.793 --> 41:00.794
No.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.173
We left.

41:14.933 --> 41:18.312
Mr. Nakamaru,
as the pharmacist on that last day,

41:18.312 --> 41:20.981
did Dr. Pou tell you
what the plan was gonna be?

41:25.402 --> 41:29.615
She told me patients
would be given lethal doses.

41:30.574 --> 41:33.994
You heard her say that,
"Lethal doses would be given"?

41:33.994 --> 41:35.162
Those exact words.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.290
That's my recollection.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.833
What happened then?

41:42.336 --> 41:46.215
I asked her what kind of medications
she would give the patients.

41:47.007 --> 41:49.885
<i>She then showed me
vials of morphine and Versed,</i>

41:49.885 --> 41:52.429
<i>which is a surgical sedative.</i>

41:53.514 --> 41:55.516
<i>She asked me for supplies,</i>

41:55.516 --> 41:58.602
<i>including syringes
and vials of sterile salt water.</i>

41:59.978 --> 42:01.480
Sterile salt water?

42:02.564 --> 42:05.234
It's what we used to chase drugs
through intravenous catheters

42:05.234 --> 42:06.777
into patient's bloodstreams.

42:07.444 --> 42:10.948
So, as a pharmacist,
did you give her the stuff she requested?

42:11.657 --> 42:13.408
Yes, I did.

42:16.537 --> 42:19.498
Well, did you see her, or the nurses,
administer the drugs?

42:28.674 --> 42:31.802
<i>I saw them draw up
the drugs into syringes.</i>

42:34.972 --> 42:37.975
<i>But I didn't see them actually
inject the patients. No.</i>

42:37.975 --> 42:39.518
Did you see anything else?

42:41.687 --> 42:44.439
Yeah, afterwards.

42:46.149 --> 42:49.444
I saw Dr. Pou
coming out of one of the rooms.

42:49.528 --> 42:53.615
She had put the syringes
in a clear plastic waste bag.

42:57.244 --> 42:58.745
<i>Then Pou asked me something.</i>

42:59.705 --> 43:01.081
What was that?

43:03.917 --> 43:06.837
She asked me to check on the patients...

43:08.922 --> 43:11.175
and pull the sheets
over the ones who had died.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.389
You believe...

43:18.390 --> 43:22.519
In my opinion, there's no other conclusion
you could draw.

43:26.273 --> 43:27.774
Those patients were murdered.
