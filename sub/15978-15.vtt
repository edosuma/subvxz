WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.538
Human greatness,
how many people can truly say

00:04.572 --> 00:05.873
they're the best at anything?

00:05.906 --> 00:08.342
Michael Jordan may be the best
to ever play basketball;

00:08.376 --> 00:11.612
Steve Jobs, perhaps
our greatest innovator;

00:11.645 --> 00:14.482
but Leesburg is home to a man
whose place in history

00:14.515 --> 00:16.150
will never be debated.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.552
Barry Jorgensen is about
to break his own record

00:18.586 --> 00:21.622
with his 60th tattoo
of actress Jennifer Garner.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.258
Barry, you're telling me
that 59 tattoos

00:24.292 --> 00:27.661
of Ben Affleck's wife
just wasn't enough, huh?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.297
Well, you know, half of these

00:29.330 --> 00:31.132
actually used
to be Hilary Swank,

00:31.165 --> 00:34.235
but she fell off real hard
after her second Oscar.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.571
So I had them plump up the lips,
shave down the chin,

00:37.605 --> 00:40.608
then bam, J. Garn.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.543
That's a cut.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.279
Sorry, I got
a little nauseous.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.714
Ooh. Yeah, what was it,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.516
the J. Garn peeking
from under the armpit

00:48.549 --> 00:50.151
of the one where
his nipple made

00:50.184 --> 00:52.253
it look like she
had a lazy eye?
Oh, no...

00:52.286 --> 00:53.621
I'm a little hungover, man.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.722
My dad came in town.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.357
You know when he comes
through here,

00:56.390 --> 00:57.591
it's always
a whirlwind weekend.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.693
Now, the Whirlwind
is a drink we made up.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.595
You have to drink it
out of the blender

01:01.629 --> 01:03.764
while the blender's
still going. (laughs)

01:03.797 --> 01:06.834
I almost lost
my tongue twice.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.637
Three times!
(laughs)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.372
You know, I think it's
great that you can spend

01:11.405 --> 01:12.573
so much time with your dad.
I can't do it.

01:12.606 --> 01:16.610
It's like we've been on an
awkward first date for 42 years.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.479
I mean, we... we can't even
get on the same page whether

01:18.512 --> 01:19.880
to hug or shake hands.
Mm.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.250
One time he kissed me
on the ear.
Ooh!

01:22.283 --> 01:23.684
You'll figure it out.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.387
All dads and sons have
something in common.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.688
Know what I'm talking
about, right?

01:27.721 --> 01:28.856
I don't know.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.458
My dad and I
are pretty different.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.860
Wouldn't you say, Dad?

01:32.893 --> 01:34.662
Yeah, totally.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.097
I'm into Ozzy Osbourne.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.135
Half of these
used to be Penny Marshall,

01:41.169 --> 01:45.105
but she fell off hard
after Laverne & Shirley.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.635
Well, we're off.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.903
There's the happy travelers.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.371
Excited for your big trip?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.572
Oh! Over the moon.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.308
This is the year's
biggest conference

02:20.341 --> 02:21.842
for vegan small business owners.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.777
Was it hard to find a hotel

02:23.811 --> 02:26.947
that could accommodate
all ten of you?

02:26.980 --> 02:28.516
The only hard part's gonna
be leaving

02:28.549 --> 02:29.950
our little princess
for the first time.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.686
You know, I don't care
what the invite says,

02:32.720 --> 02:34.555
I still think
we should bring her.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.191
We could say that she's still
nursing-- we'd be heroes.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.892
Honey, we can't.
She's already missed two days

02:38.926 --> 02:40.461
of school for the bean festival.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.497
Ah, Legumapalooza.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.500
That was fun. I got
Tobey Maguire's autograph.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.535
Oh!

02:47.568 --> 02:49.470
(mouthing)

02:51.839 --> 02:53.941
Hey.
Hello!

02:53.974 --> 02:55.909
Fret not, I'm here
for the weekend

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
to tie your shoelaces,

02:57.611 --> 03:00.214
slice up your food
so you don't choke,

03:00.248 --> 03:02.283
and get you to bed on time.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.585
I'm also here
to take care of Mikayla.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.890
I cowrote that in the car
on the way over.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.892
Don't worry, Dad, I'm gonna
zing Mom in a minute.

03:11.925 --> 03:15.296
Mom, you didn't have to bring
groceries. We have food.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.997
You have nuts and seeds
and beans.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.401
That's not dinner, that's
the bottom of a hamster cage.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.304
And mom knows a thing or two
about cooking dinner

03:23.337 --> 03:26.974
'cause she does it
all the time... poorly. Zing!

03:27.007 --> 03:28.909
I rushed it! Damn it!

03:28.942 --> 03:32.446
You rushed it
and left everyone unsatisfied.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.582
You get that from your dad.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.586
And that's how you zing.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.692
Mm! All right,
thanks again, Mom.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
It's a comfort knowing
there'll be someone here

03:46.760 --> 03:49.863
who won't go to the microwave
when the doorbell rings.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.967
Tom, you can't drink
beer this time of day.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.236
You're not a Kennedy.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.675
Hey, listen, Dad, instead
of staying here and watching Mom

04:01.709 --> 04:03.010
give all the plants
alcohol poisoning,

04:03.043 --> 04:05.045
why don't you come stay
with me this weekend?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.015
No, I'm good. I'm not a huge fan
of indoor plants.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.417
I don't sleep outside.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.619
I don't know why they get
to come in here.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.854
Right, but come on.
It'll be fun.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.457
Look, I know that we haven't
always enjoyed the same things,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.892
but maybe we haven't
been looking hard enough.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.295
A little father/son
bonding time, huh?

04:21.329 --> 04:24.298
I guess that could be fun.
We're cut from the same cloth,

04:24.332 --> 04:25.866
for crying out loud.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.336
Yeah, well, I mean,
I'm more of a cotton twill,

04:28.369 --> 04:29.637
and you're kind
of a poly blend,

04:29.670 --> 04:31.805
but sure, we're from
the same fabric store.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.574
We're not gonna sew, are we?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.808
No.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.044
Then I'm in.
We'll find something in common.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.947
Of course we will!
Come on! Let's do this!

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
Oh, sorry.
Oh, yeah.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.484
Oh.
Oh, right.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.786
Come Monday, we'll have
this nailed, huh?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.388
Oh.

04:51.925 --> 04:55.329
(detector beeping)
Mm, I'm picking up on something.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.029
Sounds like a coin.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.565
(detector beeping faster)

04:57.598 --> 05:00.401
Oh, damn it, it's just
my shoes again.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.803
Next time, remind me
not to wear penny loafers.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.806
"Next time," that's cute.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.709
You know, we just haven't gotten
to the fun part yet,

05:08.742 --> 05:10.578
opening our treasure.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.813
Ah...

05:14.047 --> 05:16.784
Matchbox car, half a doorknob,

05:16.817 --> 05:21.589
and a cover to the battery
compartment of a metal detector.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.725
Oh. That's where it went.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.727
I'm never gonna get

05:26.760 --> 05:28.762
you excited about this, am I?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.398
No, no, no,
you know what, Dad?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.131
I-I can try harder.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.401
Maybe my mistake
was being sober.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.837
Well, we could do your thing--
go back to the gym.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.539
I could try
to finish that sit-up.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.041
Really? You'd do that?

05:41.074 --> 05:43.411
No, I don't think
I could show

05:43.444 --> 05:45.679
my face in there again
after that fart.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.616
In the steam room.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.052
It's probably still there.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.522
Aw...

05:54.555 --> 05:56.757
I mean, come on,
there's gotta be something

05:56.790 --> 05:58.759
that we both enjoy.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.628
Ooh, I forgot!

06:00.661 --> 06:03.464
My Civil War buttons
and bullet collection

06:03.497 --> 06:04.532
is soaking in the kitchen.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.133
We can polish 'em up,

06:06.166 --> 06:07.868
sort 'em by rank and regiment.

06:07.901 --> 06:08.869
Cool!

06:08.902 --> 06:10.938
Just bring
a lot of booze back.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.075
Whoo! No time
for pleasantries, Nate.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.445
Gotta watch
the soccer match.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.979
My damn Wi-Fi
been on the fritz

06:19.012 --> 06:20.814
ever since I broke up
with that chick

06:20.848 --> 06:22.015
that works
at the Internet.

06:22.049 --> 06:22.883
Hey, Ray.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.119
Nathan, I lost
a bullet down your sink.

06:26.153 --> 06:30.458
Be careful not to shoot yourself
when you turn on the disposal.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.060
Keep it down, Tom. I'm having
a hard time focusing.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.529
The announcer's speaking
in Bantu.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.064
Soccer? How can
you watch that?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.165
It's so boring.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.133
When you got $300
on the game.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.135
If the blue team
beats the red team,

06:42.169 --> 06:43.837
I'll finally have
my Botox money.

06:43.871 --> 06:47.475
Black don't crack,
but it sags.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.077
So we're rooting
for blue, huh?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.144
Wait-- what
do you mean, "we"?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.212
I thought you hated sports.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.616
I do, but Ray's way
of watching makes more sense

06:55.649 --> 06:59.152
to me because there's an actual
reason to care which color wins.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.488
You know what?
Maybe gambling

07:00.521 --> 07:01.789
is something
we can do together.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.056
Plus you said that
you've been looking

07:03.090 --> 07:04.458
for a reason
to like blue again.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.527
Yeah, your mother's
varicose veins

07:06.560 --> 07:08.596
really turned me off
of that color.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.598
But I'd be willing
to give it a shot.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.566
But the game already started.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.001
Ray, what do you say?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.168
Come on. The game's
still nothing-nothing.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.937
Can we each have
a third of your bet?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.106
Like, a hundred bucks each
on the blue team.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.241
I don't know, man. Might be bad
luck to split a bet.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.510
COMMENTATOR:
Goal!

07:22.543 --> 07:24.512
No, damn it!
Come on, Mawata Gana.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.714
You're killing me, man!

07:26.747 --> 07:28.616
You're freaking killing me!

07:28.649 --> 07:32.486
Kick the damn ball!
Kick the damn ball!

07:34.655 --> 07:37.658
Yeah, let's go ahead
and split this bet up.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.931
This is yummy!

07:43.964 --> 07:47.167
Of course it's yummy,
'cause Grandma made it.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.205
Something's off.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.675
Oh, no. No, no, no!

07:54.708 --> 07:56.009
Stop eating.
Stop eating.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.511
You're eating
the one with the meat.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.245
And you don't eat meat.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.514
Spit it out,
spit it out.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.215
You've got mine
and I've got yours.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.218
Oh, no. What was it?

08:05.252 --> 08:07.621
Rabbit? Cat?!

08:07.655 --> 08:09.523
No, it was just beef, honey.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.891
I ate a horse?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.126
No, it's cow.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.695
The school system
is failing you

08:14.728 --> 08:16.063
as much as your parents.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.699
What's gonna happen to me?!

08:18.732 --> 08:22.536
Nothing. It was my fault,
but it was an honest mistake.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.605
And no one needs to know
about it,

08:24.638 --> 08:26.740
especially your parents.

08:26.774 --> 08:29.209
Okay.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.078
I feel weird.

08:31.111 --> 08:35.048
That's just your body converting
the protein into energy.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.922
(commentator speaking Bantu)

08:42.355 --> 08:43.891
Goal!

08:43.924 --> 08:46.326
ALL:
Goal!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.862
Okay, okay, it's 4-4.
We gotta have a shootout.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.600
Miss it, miss it, miss it!

08:52.633 --> 08:55.636
Oh! Okay,
we're still alive.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.871
We gotta make this one.
Have to.

08:57.905 --> 09:02.309
Our fate is in your hands,
Niameabutu Neskabara Lop-Lop.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.344
Get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.779
get it,
get it! get it!

09:05.813 --> 09:10.684
Goal! Hey, why didn't
you guys say it with me?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.620
They didn't score, Dad.
We lost.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.122
Has to go in the net
every time?

09:15.155 --> 09:16.724
Aw, man.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.091
That's it.
From now on,

09:18.125 --> 09:19.727
I'm only betting
on stuff I know about:

09:19.760 --> 09:23.363
football and spelling bees.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.000
Quick tip: Always bet
on a Indian kid.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.837
Hey, look, it's s a bummer,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.338
but it was
an exciting game, huh?

09:31.371 --> 09:33.607
Fun way to spend a couple
of hours, right, Dad?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.643
Dad?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.078
We just lost $200
for nothing.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.080
How could I be so stupid?

09:40.113 --> 09:43.250
Let me pay for it. I'll skip
two haircuts this month.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.086
I'm not letting my son
pay my debts.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.387
Come on. It was worth that much

09:47.420 --> 09:49.089
just to have such a fun time
with you.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.358
It shouldn't cost $200
to have fun with somebody

09:51.391 --> 09:53.794
unless there's a pretty
woman involved.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.731
Or two ugly ones.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.634
Come on, Dad. We were cheering,
we chest bumped.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.735
We never chest bump.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.370
And now I know why.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.305
You jammed all my pens
into my boob.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.342
It's like I have seven
blue nipples right now.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.344
Dad, the only reason that I bet

10:11.378 --> 10:13.413
was so that we could have
something in common.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.382
We do now: debt.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.784
Please, let me pay your share.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.119
No, in fact,
I have to pay your share now.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.654
No. Why?
Yeah.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.155
Because you said that you never
would have bet

10:22.189 --> 10:23.090
if it wasn't for me.

10:23.123 --> 10:28.328
Damn you,
Niameabutu Neskabara Lop-Lop.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.963
Here you go, Ray.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.299
You're lucky I just
went to the ATM

10:32.332 --> 10:34.968
and my fat fingers
hit too many zeroes.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.238
Good-bye, 200 items
off the dollar menu.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.775
Double burger, gone!

10:41.809 --> 10:43.310
Senior coffee, gone!

10:43.343 --> 10:47.047
Apple turnover that burns
the roof of your mouth, gone!

10:47.080 --> 10:50.117
Vanilla milkshake that soothes
the roof of your mouth, gone!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.952
Hi.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.822
Admit it-- your dad eats
a lot of junk food.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.390
Believe me, you don't want
to be with him in a steam room.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.366
(yawns)

11:08.468 --> 11:09.970
(sighs)

11:20.247 --> 11:21.181
Honey...

11:46.439 --> 11:48.308
Morning, Grandma!

11:48.341 --> 11:50.477
Morning, sweetie.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.415
Do you want to talk about
what happened last night?

11:55.448 --> 11:57.951
Did something happen
last night?

11:57.985 --> 11:59.887
I don't remember anything.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.455
You don't remember
diving face-first

12:02.489 --> 12:04.892
into a plate of meat lasagna?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.059
Hmm.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.028
Were my arms out like this?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.330
Because if they were,
that means I was sleepwalking.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.365
I see.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.400
Okay.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.137
So...

12:20.473 --> 12:23.510
...what do you
want to do today?

12:23.543 --> 12:25.745
Go to the park?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.949
The movies?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.325
Sweetheart, are you sure
you don't want to talk about

12:38.358 --> 12:39.526
what happened last night?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.494
(crying)

12:41.528 --> 12:44.464
Oh, sweetie, don't cry.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.334
You're not in trouble.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.170
No, it's not that.

12:50.203 --> 12:54.241
It's just...
meat tastes so good.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.078
Yeah, that's why
it's so popular.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.550
How am I gonna
tell my parents
I'm a meat-eater?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.452
Well, sweetie...

13:05.485 --> 13:07.487
just tell 'em.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.356
Now that you're
eating meat,

13:09.389 --> 13:10.958
even if they get upset,

13:10.991 --> 13:13.560
you can probably
just overpower them.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.794
I don't know.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.466
(detector beeping slowly)

13:19.499 --> 13:20.834
Out the way, Tom!

13:20.868 --> 13:22.569
I'm looking for change.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.971
Well, I can't see
the dog show.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.605
And I bet 100 bucks
on a dog

13:25.638 --> 13:29.009
that looks like a mop.

13:29.042 --> 13:31.344
Oh, shoot, I think
I might've just bet on a mop!

13:32.545 --> 13:34.514
(detector beeping faster)

13:34.547 --> 13:35.548
(beeping rapidly)

13:36.449 --> 13:37.918
It's wrapped in tinfoil.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.952
Don't ask.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.923
Hey, Dad.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.357
Check it out.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.459
I got us two tickets to the big
Civil War memorabilia show

13:46.493 --> 13:47.895
in DC today.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.997
They're gonna open up
a can of potted meat

13:50.030 --> 13:52.532
that's been sealed since 1860.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.401
I can't go.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.037
Not until I earn back
the $200 I lost.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.939
Oh, and, uh, say hi

13:58.972 --> 14:01.008
to the John Wilkes Booth
impersonator for me.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.309
Don't shake
his hand, though.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.144
He's a nose-picker.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.879
(door closes)

14:05.913 --> 14:07.314
(sighs)
Aw, crap.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.883
Dad and I are missing out
on a great afternoon

14:09.917 --> 14:12.119
'cause he's still obsessed
with the stupid money he lost.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.355
You're lucky you didn't go
halfsies on this dog with me.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.523
Oh, I see the stick now.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.127
I bet on a damn mop!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.531
Hey.
What are you doing here?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.199
Oh, there were certain
things I needed

14:26.233 --> 14:27.968
that Debbie didn't have
in her fridge.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.904
Mikayla's expanding
her culinary horizons.

14:30.938 --> 14:34.908
Oh, wow,
meatballs.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.310
It's like cookie dough

14:37.344 --> 14:39.346
but made out of a beast.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.583
Oh, my God. Mom!

14:43.616 --> 14:45.018
It was an accident.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.286
Well, it's not a big deal.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.687
If there's one thing
we know about vegans,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.489
it's they got a pretty
good sense of humor

14:49.522 --> 14:51.091
about stuff like this.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
So how are things going
with you and your dad?

14:54.561 --> 14:55.996
Find anything in common yet?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.197
No, not yet.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.698
No matter how desperate you get,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.968
just do not have
a baby with him.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.435
It won't help.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.438
Man... Look at that.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.208
I spent 300 bucks on this
stupid Civil War belt buckle.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.209
I was gonna
surprise my dad

15:09.242 --> 15:11.178
and let him wear it to
the memorabilia show.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.679
Sell it and give him the cash,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.614
so he can stop looking
for treasure in my pants.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.185
Did you wrap it
in tinfoil again?

15:18.218 --> 15:21.554
It helps with my Wi-fi signal.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
I tried to give him money,
but he won't take it.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.726
Wait a second.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.263
This is worth more than
he lost on the stupid bet.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.999
And it's metal,
so he can find it.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.034
All I gotta do is
plant it somewhere.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.235
Oh, my God.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.236
Pork is delicious.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.306
And they come with handles.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.543
(detector beeping slowly)

15:57.090 --> 15:59.092
(detector beeping faster)

16:00.727 --> 16:02.996
(detector beeping rapidly)

16:11.204 --> 16:13.440
Yeah, put me down
for 50 on the Indian kid.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.643
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:16.676 --> 16:19.179
And 20 on
the Chinese kid to show.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.482
There he is.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.651
The proud hunter returning home
from the hunt.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.019
How was it out there?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.554
I call it a good day.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.589
Almost four dollars
in change.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.424
And one real treasure.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.694
A harmonica!

16:34.727 --> 16:36.263
And it works.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.730
Tom, don't put that nasty-ass
harmonica in your mouth.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.566
(plays chord)

16:39.599 --> 16:41.201
What was that?

16:41.234 --> 16:43.736
I think it was a hobo's tooth.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.771
Dad, come on.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.773
That harmonica was
all you found?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.375
Yep.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.609
It's a hobo's tooth.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.280
I think he might've had
a crystal meth problem.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.816
You didn't find any accessories?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.351
Like, say, I don't know...

16:58.385 --> 17:00.587
maybe a buckle
that might keep a belt buckled?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.655
Like, for instance,
a belt buckle?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.624
How did you know
I found a belt buckle?

17:04.657 --> 17:05.658
Because I put it there.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.659
Where is it?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.395
I threw it away.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.662
You threw it away?!

17:11.698 --> 17:13.366
How could you throw away
the belt buckle?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.135
I'm anti-belt.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.303
Just get pants that fit.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.370
If you lose a little weight,

17:17.404 --> 17:19.639
just cinch it up with a rope
and a little latch.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.707
That's a belt!

17:20.740 --> 17:22.242
(crashing)

17:22.275 --> 17:24.511
(lift whirring)

17:26.213 --> 17:27.547
Hey!
Hey!

17:27.580 --> 17:28.748
Hey,
Hey, hey!

17:28.781 --> 17:29.682
Wait!

17:29.716 --> 17:30.683
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

17:30.717 --> 17:32.652
Hey!
Hey,
hey, hey!

17:32.685 --> 17:35.188
Hey, hey, hey!

17:42.795 --> 17:44.631
That was wild.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.465
(engine rumbling)

17:45.498 --> 17:47.800
But we'll never find
that belt buckle.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.402
Dad, we're stuck
in a trash truck.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.637
We got bigger problems
than the buckle.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.272
Aah!

17:52.305 --> 17:53.706
Just felt something
crawl around my ankle.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.642
Probably a rat.
I hate rats!

17:55.675 --> 17:56.809
Of course you hate rats.

17:56.843 --> 17:57.810
Who likes rats?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.279
Scientists, cats...

18:01.214 --> 18:02.815
Watch out!

18:02.849 --> 18:05.518
If you hadn't tried to trick me,
none of this would've happened.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.154
Look, if you'd just let
me pay off your bet,

18:07.187 --> 18:08.155
then I wouldn't
have had to try

18:08.188 --> 18:09.589
to trick you in
the first place!

18:09.622 --> 18:10.723
(squeaking)
Get back.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.891
Get back.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.660
I never asked
for your charity.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.362
Look, you're my dad.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.829
I can't just sit back
and let you suffer.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.798
Why couldn't you just accept
my help when I offered it?

18:18.831 --> 18:20.767
Because I am
your dad!

18:20.800 --> 18:22.169
You aren't supposed
to bail me out,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.303
I'm supposed to
bail you out!

18:23.336 --> 18:24.604
Look out!

18:24.637 --> 18:26.606
No, Dad, get
behind me.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.640
No, you get
behind me.
Dad, get
behind me.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.676
No, get behind me!
Get-get...
I got this, Dad!

18:29.709 --> 18:30.743
Look at us, Dad.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.546
Look at us, we're just
trying to save each other.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.148
It's like we're
both hardwired

18:35.182 --> 18:36.449
to be the protector
in this family.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.185
I think that's why
I couldn't sit back

18:38.218 --> 18:39.719
and let you suffer
about the bet.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.688
That's the same reason
I couldn't take your money.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.291
You already help your sister,
and now your mom...

18:44.324 --> 18:45.725
I don't want to be
another person you help.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.795
I want to be the guy
that everyone depends on.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.797
I think I want that, too.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.700
Hey, something in common.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.901
We found it.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.705
Hey!
Hey!

18:58.738 --> 19:00.307
We both went for the hug!

19:00.340 --> 19:01.308
(laughs)

19:01.341 --> 19:02.309
(rustling, squeaking)

19:02.342 --> 19:03.810
We both may be

19:03.843 --> 19:04.811
protectors at heart,

19:04.844 --> 19:06.246
but I'm still your dad

19:06.279 --> 19:07.914
and it's my job to save you.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.649
No!

19:09.682 --> 19:10.850
No, Dad, don't go down there!

19:10.883 --> 19:13.786
It's probably what
it wants you to do.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.822
(chittering, squeaking)

19:17.657 --> 19:18.958
Dad, was it
a big rat?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.893
A normal-sized rat.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.929
But the thing
that ate it was huge.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.598
(squeaking)

19:30.770 --> 19:33.606
And one for our
little broccolini.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.841
There.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.410
Yeah, Dad,
about the hat...

19:39.546 --> 19:41.748
Guys, Mikayla has something
she needs to share with you.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.616
And you need to have
an open mind about it,

19:43.650 --> 19:45.585
and love
your daughter

19:45.618 --> 19:47.320
no matter what.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.922
Well... honey,
what is it?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.691
You know you can
tell us anything.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.260
ADAM:
Yeah, there's no secrets
in this family.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.795
Okay?
We're the Broccoli Bunch.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.599
Mom...

19:59.632 --> 20:01.268
Dad...

20:01.301 --> 20:03.270
I...

20:03.303 --> 20:04.671
You what, honey?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.407
I was twirling
my baton in my room,

20:07.440 --> 20:08.808
even though you said not to,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.010
and broke my music box.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.513
DEBBIE:
Well, you know you're
not supposed to do that.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.014
But we're really
proud of you

20:15.047 --> 20:16.015
for being honest.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.485
It's such a grown-up
thing to do.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.719
And you do look grown-up.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.221
I swear, it looks like you grew
an inch while we were gone.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.292
Well, we should
go out.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.627
We've got a lot of
blood to wash off the
front of the car.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.296
Ironically, we hit a cow

20:29.329 --> 20:31.331
on the highway coming home.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.801
What happened, kid?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.736
They weren't ready.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.738
They gave me a
stupid broccoli hat,

20:38.771 --> 20:39.672
for crying out loud.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.342
Well...

20:42.375 --> 20:44.944
you're a thoughtful girl,
and I'm proud of you.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.314
And just so you know...

20:47.347 --> 20:49.416
Grandma's always got
a little beef jerky

20:49.449 --> 20:51.017
in the bottom
of her purse.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.252
And in her bedside table.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.324
And in her glove compartment.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.692
No, I ate that.
Never mind.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.062
Now come on.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.997
Where are we going?

21:05.031 --> 21:08.034
We gotta go smash up
a music box.
