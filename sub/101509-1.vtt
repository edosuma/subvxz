37:33.960 --> 37:36.045
And then you cross your fingers
that the bastards

37:36.045 --> 37:37.297
don't steal the ideas.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.178
I'm on a five, Harry.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.637
Can you make me
a pastrami on rye?

37:45.889 --> 37:48.183
-I love New York.
-[Leo] Well...

37:49.184 --> 37:50.810
if you can't find a job writing
you can always...

37:50.810 --> 37:52.562
-[bell dings]
-...fall back on your dancing.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.273
Sure, Pop.
You want me to be a Rockette?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.859
I know you wanna be a journalist
like your mother,

37:57.859 --> 38:00.570
but if you can't find work using
your fingers at a typewriter

38:01.112 --> 38:02.697
you can always use those legs.
Hmm?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.032
[chuckles]

38:04.491 --> 38:06.784
I read in Variety,
there's even a chorus line

38:06.784 --> 38:09.662
looking for five Beta-Kappa
girls over five-foot seven

38:09.662 --> 38:11.915
to dance in an outfit
called the High-Five Betas.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.333
That's you.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.668
I've got an interview
in ten minutes.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.006
-Wish me luck. See you at 6:00?
-Yeah. I'm on my way out.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.591
I got an auction in Jersey later

38:21.591 --> 38:23.176
then down to New Orleans
the day after.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.763
-Okay. [kisses]
-[Leo kisses]

38:27.472 --> 38:29.766
Remember, those desk jobs
can fatten your ankles.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.436
-Us Steinems like to move.
-Hmm.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.271
Sure do.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.000

-He's back office.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.755
[Gloria sighs]

39:05.552 --> 39:08.805
Hmm, I see you've read
some stuff at college, but...

39:09.889 --> 39:12.183
[sighs] ...listen,
here at the magazine,

39:12.183 --> 39:13.601
we hire girls that do
the research

39:13.601 --> 39:15.019
-and the men write.
-Why is that?

39:15.019 --> 39:16.271
It's just the w--

39:17.730 --> 39:18.690
You're right.

39:19.732 --> 39:20.650
Why is that?

39:23.027 --> 39:25.780
Okay. So, what do you wanna
write about?

39:27.282 --> 39:28.157
I, uh...

39:28.616 --> 39:29.993
I-- I just returned

39:29.993 --> 39:31.786
from two years
traveling in India.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.623
The experiences and the stories
I saw and heard are amazing

39:35.623 --> 39:37.458
-and I would just love to--
-Look. [sighs]

39:37.458 --> 39:38.793
I'm gonna try you out

39:38.793 --> 39:40.753
on a fashion assignment.

-[typewriter keys clack]

40:05.236 --> 40:07.363
...out of their minds
from the knee down.

40:13.328 --> 40:16.623
[man] Good job, Gloria,
and it's funny.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.667
Rare to see a woman writer
with a sense of humor.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.794
Thanks. I was thinking...

40:22.587 --> 40:24.631
what about a profile
on Mayor Lindsay?

40:24.631 --> 40:26.090
What about a profile
of his wife?

40:26.090 --> 40:27.800
I'm sure she's very interesting.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.094
But as a general rule,
I'm more interested

40:30.094 --> 40:31.471
-in politicians.
-General rule.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.972
You're too young
to have general rules.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.516
Look. You're nothing
like our lady readers,

40:35.516 --> 40:38.937
but you're female, so try
to put yourself in their place

40:38.937 --> 40:40.271
for this next assignment.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.690
Spice it up
with some of your wit.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.484
We need it tomorrow morning.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.154
You can use Percy's desk.
He's out on assignment.

-[man] Good teaser.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.336
Uh. The coffee's out.
Could you make some more?

41:03.336 --> 41:05.129
-[man] Here you go.
-Just a second.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.249
-Here it is.
-Thanks, hon.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.001
Oh, also, Gloria...

42:26.919 --> 42:28.838
would you mind... [sighs]

42:28.838 --> 42:30.548
...mailing these letters
and then...

42:33.342 --> 42:35.887
you can meet me at the Hilton,

A hot fudge sundae, please.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.492
How about some eggs first?

42:58.534 --> 43:00.203
-No.
-No? Okay.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.038
Coming right up.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.209
One hot fudge sundae
for breakfast.

43:06.209 --> 43:07.460
With whipped cream on that.

43:08.586 --> 43:13.091
[song playing over radio]

43:17.804 --> 43:19.222
I just quit a job.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.099
You want a cherry on top?

43:23.392 --> 43:24.435
Sure.

43:26.562 --> 43:29.774
-Eat your vegetables, Gloria.
-I'm not hungry.

43:32.151 --> 43:35.029
Sometimes you're hungry
for one thing and not another.

Oh, you got to stuff it, Marie.

43:52.672 --> 43:56.884
-Stuff it?
-Here. Just in and up.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.179
No, don't use dry cleaning bags
they'll make you sweat.

44:00.763 --> 44:03.558
-You can use Kotex pads.
-Work it up bunny tails.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.769

A little more.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.674
-[bunny 2] You got to smile.
-[camera shutter clicks]

44:36.674 --> 44:38.718
They give us demerits
if we don't smile.

44:39.218 --> 44:40.303
Demerits?

44:40.303 --> 44:42.430
Yeah.
Pay cuts if you don't smile.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.473
If you don't fit
into your costume.

44:44.473 --> 44:46.350
Or if we don't do
the bunny dip while serving.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.144
The bunny dip?

44:48.519 --> 44:49.604
Like so.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.231
-You'll get the hang of it.
-[chuckles]

44:53.149 --> 44:54.817
Oh, and one more thing,
little one,

44:54.817 --> 44:56.402
don't sleep with the customers.

44:56.986 --> 44:58.654
Even if they have
a member's key.

-They need us upstairs, pronto.
-[Gloria] Okay.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.683
[man] Yeah.
She may need to go forward.

45:27.683 --> 45:28.768
[woman] Seriously.

45:28.768 --> 45:30.227
-Whatever you want.
-He's always...

45:30.227 --> 45:33.356
Oh, no, they walked out
onto the sidewalk there,

45:33.356 --> 45:34.565
really, I...

45:34.565 --> 45:36.275
-Yes.
-And... [laughs] Unbelievable.

45:36.525 --> 45:39.487
[indistinct chatter]

46:01.258 --> 46:05.012
[Gloria] It's been two weeks.
I still haven't been paid yet.

46:05.012 --> 46:06.514
That's because we're still
in training.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.724
-Is that normal?
-[utensils clattering]

46:08.724 --> 46:10.267

for three weeks

with no pay at all.

Who's not doing their job?

I've been working nine hours
straight with no break.

-My feet are killing me.
-Is that even legal?

What's legal got to do with it?

Have you had
your medical exam yet?

-[bunny 3] Here you go.
-Thank you.

you don't have any diseases...

Danny, can I get a scotch
and two martinis?

46:39.922 --> 46:40.923
Make 'em dry.

46:41.549 --> 46:45.511

-[all cheer]
-Yeah.

47:55.831 --> 47:58.375
The costumes are so tight
that they'd give a man cleavage.

-[people laugh]
-Then you could look at yourself

48:00.044 --> 48:01.128
in the mirror all day

48:01.128 --> 48:02.880
instead of staring
at the secretaries

What do you say?

No, thank you.

a little more comfortable here.

Let me just pull that off.

49:14.994 --> 49:15.953
[nurse] Great.

49:18.455 --> 49:20.457
-Gloria.
-How are you, Mom?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.585
Oh, let's not talk about me.

49:23.043 --> 49:24.628
Now, look at this.

49:25.546 --> 49:27.882
[chuckles] One of the nurses
gave it to me.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.758
I was hoping
you wouldn't see it.

49:29.758 --> 49:30.718
Why not?

49:30.718 --> 49:32.052
I don't know. It's just...

49:33.387 --> 49:36.223
It doesn't seem to matter
why I was a bunny.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.602
It doesn't seem to matter
that I was exposing

49:39.602 --> 49:41.187
horrific working conditions.

49:41.979 --> 49:45.566
All that seems to matter
to people is that I was a bunny.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.611
I wish I'd never put on
that stupid outfit.

49:53.741 --> 49:56.327
So, people saw you as a bunny,
so what?

49:58.746 --> 50:00.080
You're a writer.

50:01.874 --> 50:04.877
You have a real byline.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.754
[Ruth] Look at that.

50:09.340 --> 50:14.220
I'm so proud of you, Gloria.
This is important journalism.

50:15.179 --> 50:18.974
Those women in bunny outfits,
they're gonna thank you one day.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.726
Mom, before you met Pop,

50:20.726 --> 50:23.103
you were writing serious stuff
all the time.

50:26.815 --> 50:30.778
If I pressed and asked her,
"Why didn't you leave?

50:32.404 --> 50:35.950
Why didn't you take my sister
and go to New York and write?

50:35.950 --> 50:38.244
Do what you wanted to do."
She would say it didn't matter.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.414
That she was lucky
to have my sister and me.

50:44.083 --> 50:46.085
And if you'd pressed
hard enough, she'd have said,

50:46.752 --> 50:50.089
"If I left, you never would've
been born."

50:57.471 --> 50:59.098
I never had the courage to say,

51:01.308 --> 51:03.143
"But you would've been born
instead."

will probably amount

52:06.540 --> 52:08.792

and be a complete bust.

and even murdered in the South.

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:38.625
I might have to postpone that.
[sighs]

1:04:39.084 --> 1:04:43.505
I got a fellowship to study
and-- and travel.

1:04:45.381 --> 1:04:47.217
Uh, someone's paying you
to travel?

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:49.803
Very good. Where to?

1:04:50.470 --> 1:04:53.348
-India.
-Wow. India.

1:04:54.015 --> 1:04:55.892
About as far away
as you can get.

1:04:56.559 --> 1:04:58.603
So, you're not disappointed...
[laughs]

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:00.522
...about the wedding?

1:05:03.733 --> 1:05:04.776
Hell no, Gloria.

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:07.654
This opportunity is fantastic,
you can get married anytime.

1:05:11.574 --> 1:05:14.577
[clears throat] You let me know
when you get to Jaipur,

1:05:14.577 --> 1:05:16.788
because they have
superlative gems.

1:05:18.998 --> 1:05:20.792
You know,
I'll send along a money order.

1:05:22.502 --> 1:05:24.170
-Deal?
-Sure, Pop.

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:27.173
[chuckles] Okay.

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:29.217
Talk soon.

1:05:32.971 --> 1:05:33.972
Love you.

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:36.432
-[telephone disconnects]
-Okay.

1:05:41.229 --> 1:05:42.188
[telephone dings]

1:05:56.035 --> 1:05:57.162
Are you all right, miss?

1:05:58.079 --> 1:06:00.290
Can I get you something?
Water, perhaps?

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:02.876
No, um, I'm fine. Thank you.

1:06:12.135 --> 1:06:13.011
[grunts]

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:17.140
[engine revving]

1:06:33.907 --> 1:06:35.283
So... [sighs]

1:06:36.618 --> 1:06:37.744
...how did you find my name?

1:06:39.162 --> 1:06:40.205
Through a friend.

1:06:40.997 --> 1:06:42.832
Oh, you're American.

1:06:42.832 --> 1:06:44.751
-[laughs]
-What are you doing in London?

1:06:45.376 --> 1:06:47.253
Waiting for a visa. [chuckles]

1:06:48.213 --> 1:06:50.340
I have a fellowship
to study in India.

1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:53.426
-Ah.
-It's a two-year fellowship.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:56.679
I see.

1:07:04.479 --> 1:07:05.772
I can't have this baby.

1:07:06.522 --> 1:07:08.900
I'm sorry, I'm--
I'm not married.

1:07:09.984 --> 1:07:11.027
I'm not ready.

1:07:12.237 --> 1:07:15.907
[exhales] And you are aware
that what you're asking

1:07:15.907 --> 1:07:18.952
isn't, strictly speaking, legal,
even here.

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:21.120
Not unless it threatens
your life.

1:07:22.830 --> 1:07:23.915
I know.

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:26.209
All right.

1:07:33.633 --> 1:07:35.218
You must promise me two things.

1:07:36.427 --> 1:07:37.428
First...

1:07:38.263 --> 1:07:40.098
you must not tell
anybody my name.

1:07:43.017 --> 1:07:44.060
Second...

1:07:45.436 --> 1:07:48.273
you will do what you want to do
with your life.

1:07:56.489 --> 1:07:57.824
Did I keep my promise?

1:08:08.418 --> 1:08:10.962
-[siren wailing]
-[horn honks]

1:08:10.962 --> 1:08:13.715
I was just at a speak out
about illegal abortion.

1:08:14.465 --> 1:08:15.508
I have to write about it.

1:08:16.384 --> 1:08:19.095
Gloria, you've worked so hard
to be taken seriously.

1:08:20.013 --> 1:08:22.265
You're saying,
this isn't a serious issue?

1:08:22.265 --> 1:08:23.975
-It's not what I said.
-If this magazine

1:08:23.975 --> 1:08:25.143
won't write about it,

1:08:25.143 --> 1:08:27.103
then I'm just gonna have
to speak about it.

1:08:27.103 --> 1:08:29.063
You can't associate yourself
with those crazy women.

1:08:32.233 --> 1:08:33.735
I just realized something.

1:08:34.902 --> 1:08:35.903
What?

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:39.032
I am one of those crazy women.

1:08:44.912 --> 1:08:46.080
[woman] Hello.

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:47.373
[crowd clapping] Hello.

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:50.585
-I said, hello!
-[all cheer]

1:08:50.835 --> 1:08:52.295
Thank you for being here.

1:08:52.754 --> 1:08:55.048
My name
is Dorothy Pitman Hughes.

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:56.883
And I have three children.

1:08:57.342 --> 1:08:58.885
Three children
that I love deeply.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:02.764
And the one thing I have noticed
is that too many women

1:09:03.014 --> 1:09:05.516
are being forced to leave
their children home alone

1:09:06.225 --> 1:09:09.062
while they work
to feed their families.

1:09:09.062 --> 1:09:12.482
We need childcare
and we need it now.

1:09:12.482 --> 1:09:14.150
[crowd agreeing]

1:09:14.442 --> 1:09:16.527
And here to join me
in the conversation

1:09:16.861 --> 1:09:18.112
is a new friend.

1:09:18.112 --> 1:09:19.614
She wanted to speak out today.

1:09:20.490 --> 1:09:24.035
-A journalist, Gloria Steinem.
-[woman] Okay.

1:09:24.410 --> 1:09:27.205
[indistinct chatter]

1:09:39.217 --> 1:09:43.179
Until recently, I wouldn't have
admitted the equality.

1:09:43.679 --> 1:09:45.973
So, the inequality
of my own life.

1:09:46.516 --> 1:09:49.519
Even though I was discriminated
against in journalism.

1:09:50.812 --> 1:09:54.065
Journalism which allows women
to write about women,

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:56.901
and black people
to write about black people.

1:09:56.901 --> 1:09:59.904
But keeps editorial control in--

1:09:59.904 --> 1:10:00.905
[indistinct chatter]

1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:04.617
But keeps editorial control
in white male hands.

1:10:04.617 --> 1:10:06.202
[woman] I'll meet you there.

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:07.203
But I'm--

1:10:07.829 --> 1:10:11.249
but I'm here to tell you that
the majority of the population

1:10:11.249 --> 1:10:13.668
cannot be
its second-class citizens.

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:18.381
It didn't work in South Africa
and it can't work here.

1:10:18.381 --> 1:10:20.049
-[woman 1] South Africa?
-[woman 2] Really?

1:10:20.967 --> 1:10:22.677
[crowd agreeing]

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:25.972
[Gloria] I have no idea
what I even said.

1:10:26.722 --> 1:10:29.142
It was like an out of body
experience.

1:10:29.142 --> 1:10:31.227
-You've never spoken before?
-No.

1:10:31.227 --> 1:10:33.271
I figured if no one
lets me write

1:10:33.271 --> 1:10:36.357
about the women's movement
I may have to speak about it.

1:10:37.608 --> 1:10:38.776
There's only one problem.

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:39.819
-[sighs]
-What?

1:10:39.819 --> 1:10:41.904
I'm terrified
of public speaking.

1:10:41.904 --> 1:10:43.948
Well, that was obvious,
but I'm not.

1:10:44.782 --> 1:10:46.534
We'll get it together.
Don't worry about it.

1:10:48.119 --> 1:10:49.454
[wood clatters]

1:10:49.454 --> 1:10:50.997
[therapist] So,
what exactly happens

1:10:51.622 --> 1:10:53.416
before you speak in public?

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:57.795
[chuckles] First my heart pounds
then my mouth goes dry.

1:10:57.795 --> 1:10:59.922
It feels sort of, like,
an Angora sweater

1:10:59.922 --> 1:11:01.382
is wrapped around each tooth.

1:11:01.382 --> 1:11:04.093
I'm worried about getting
to the end of each sentence

1:11:04.093 --> 1:11:05.970
without swallowing and...

1:11:07.221 --> 1:11:08.639
I think I'm going to die.

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:11.392
[therapist] Hm.
Well, I think I can help.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:14.061
Writers usually have
the most trouble

1:11:14.061 --> 1:11:15.271
speaking in public,

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:17.148
because they chose
a profession purposely

1:11:17.523 --> 1:11:20.443
in which they can communicate
without speaking.

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:22.570
Well, writers and dancers.

1:11:22.945 --> 1:11:26.407
[indistinct chatter]

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:29.535
-Are you okay?
-[exhales]

1:11:31.454 --> 1:11:32.413
Okay.

1:11:33.372 --> 1:11:34.707
[Gloria] I love dancing.

1:11:36.834 --> 1:11:37.752
[chuckles]

1:11:40.505 --> 1:11:43.299
I will confess that I have
a fear of public speaking.

1:11:44.217 --> 1:11:45.885
But what Dorothy
and I have to say

1:11:45.885 --> 1:11:48.054
is too important not to say it.

1:11:52.058 --> 1:11:53.518
Is there anyone else
in the audience

1:11:53.518 --> 1:11:55.436
also scared of public speaking?

1:11:55.895 --> 1:11:57.522
[audience laughing]

1:11:57.772 --> 1:11:59.273
-[indistinct chatter]
-Right.

1:11:59.941 --> 1:12:01.317
Thank you, um.

1:12:02.068 --> 1:12:05.821
Now, let's get
to the root cause here today.

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:07.573
Reproductive rights,

1:12:08.032 --> 1:12:09.325
women need to decide...

1:12:09.325 --> 1:12:11.118
-[door opens]
-...the fate of our own bodies.

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:15.706
[footsteps approaching]

1:12:16.624 --> 1:12:17.834
[indistinct whispering]

1:12:18.793 --> 1:12:20.711
All right. Everyone out
of the room immediately.

1:12:21.128 --> 1:12:23.256
-Come on, move it.
-[woman] Just go, go. Just go.

1:12:23.256 --> 1:12:24.340
[officer 1] Now!

1:12:24.340 --> 1:12:26.133
-He said there's a bomb.
-A bomb?

1:12:26.133 --> 1:12:27.593
-[officer 1] Wait outside.
-[Dorothy] From who?

1:12:27.593 --> 1:12:29.554
-[Gloria] I don't know.
-[indistinct chatter]

1:12:29.554 --> 1:12:30.638
[Gloria]
Apparently, they got a call

1:12:30.638 --> 1:12:31.722
from a Right to Lifer.

1:12:32.056 --> 1:12:34.100
It's just incredible
that those maniacs

1:12:34.100 --> 1:12:36.352
don't even see the irony
in threatening the lives

1:12:36.352 --> 1:12:37.603
-of all these people.
-[woman] I'm okay.

1:12:37.603 --> 1:12:39.814
-[officer 1] Hurry up.
-[officer 2] Let's go.

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:46.237
[train clacking]

1:12:47.613 --> 1:12:51.409
The social and economic
revolution of the farm workers

1:12:51.409 --> 1:12:54.328
is well under way.
And it will not be stopped

1:12:54.328 --> 1:12:57.331
until we receive equality.

1:12:57.331 --> 1:12:59.834
And we don't wanna eat food
that was picked in poverty.

1:12:59.834 --> 1:13:02.336
And as fellow New Yorkers,
neither should you.

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:05.423
We wanna thank Dolores Huerta
who has come from California

1:13:05.423 --> 1:13:06.674
to be with us here today.

1:13:06.966 --> 1:13:09.802
-We support the boycott!
-[Dolores] Thank you.

1:13:10.344 --> 1:13:12.847
There will be strikes
throughout this country

1:13:12.847 --> 1:13:15.182
because we have shown
what can be done.

1:13:15.558 --> 1:13:19.353
Every minute is a chance
to change the world.

1:13:19.645 --> 1:13:21.439
Can we change the world?

1:13:21.439 --> 1:13:22.481
-Yes, we can.
-[all agree]

1:13:27.987 --> 1:13:30.281
[speaking Spanish]

1:13:32.658 --> 1:13:35.161
I'll pitch an article
of the boycott to my editor.

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:36.829
We'll get you a story out.

1:13:37.371 --> 1:13:38.331
[Dolores] You can try.

1:13:38.748 --> 1:13:39.915
But you know
orange juice companies

1:13:39.915 --> 1:13:41.626
advertise in magazines, right?
[chuckles]

1:13:42.835 --> 1:13:43.961
Don't waste your breath
just on print.

1:13:44.295 --> 1:13:45.463
Take it on the road.

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:47.632
Keep talking.

1:13:49.175 --> 1:13:50.426
How are your kids?

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:52.303
My kids...

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:54.347
they're mad at me.

1:13:55.514 --> 1:13:56.515
I'm never home.

1:13:57.099 --> 1:14:01.228
Hm. I hear you. It's tough.
Let's just hope it's worth it.

1:14:04.023 --> 1:14:07.652
This year, the press has finally
discovered a movement

1:14:07.652 --> 1:14:10.988
that has already been strong
for several years now.

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:15.785
And reported it as a small
privileged rather lunatic event

1:14:15.785 --> 1:14:18.329
instead of a major revolution
in consciousness.

1:14:18.329 --> 1:14:22.541
Everyone's consciousness. Male
and female, Black and white.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:23.417
This is the year

1:14:23.751 --> 1:14:26.796
-of women's liberation.
-[crowd cheering]

1:14:27.213 --> 1:14:30.424
University of Alabama,
Pennsville, October 12.

1:14:30.424 --> 1:14:33.469
Salem's College.
Bristol, Virginia on the 13th.

1:14:33.469 --> 1:14:34.845
Florida State University
on the 4th--

1:14:34.845 --> 1:14:36.472
[flight attendant] Could you
please not do that here?

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:38.307
-Or go into the lavatory?
-That's obscene.

1:14:40.685 --> 1:14:43.145
Actually, refusing
to feed a child is obscene.

1:14:44.855 --> 1:14:45.815
Gloria.

1:14:47.233 --> 1:14:49.110
I'm not sure how--
how much longer

1:14:49.110 --> 1:14:50.194
I can keep doing this.

1:14:50.611 --> 1:14:52.530
-Breastfeed on planes?
-No.

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:54.949
Deal with the stupidity
of white people?

1:14:55.908 --> 1:14:57.118
-Yes.
-[laughs]

1:14:58.035 --> 1:14:59.078
But no.

1:15:00.121 --> 1:15:01.706
Being on the road this much...

1:15:02.832 --> 1:15:04.125
it's hard on the kids and...

1:15:05.501 --> 1:15:08.629
and, um, I need to be at home
more next month.

1:15:08.629 --> 1:15:09.547
[baby coos]

1:15:10.089 --> 1:15:11.924
Do you think you can do
some of these talks without me?

1:15:13.092 --> 1:15:14.051
By myself?

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:17.179
Well. No. Because...

1:15:18.764 --> 1:15:19.765
I have this friend...

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.268
a civil rights lawyer.

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:24.228
Flo Kennedy.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:27.481
A landlord is not allowed
to deny you housing

1:15:27.481 --> 1:15:29.275
because you are single.

1:15:29.275 --> 1:15:31.068
-That is some bullshit.
-[woman] Yes, Flo.

1:15:31.068 --> 1:15:33.028
[audience agreeing, clapping]

1:15:33.028 --> 1:15:34.196
Thank you.

1:15:34.822 --> 1:15:37.491

1:26:48.829 --> 1:26:50.122
And your piece on sisterhood.

1:26:50.747 --> 1:26:52.749
Um. All the magazine people
said,

1:26:52.749 --> 1:26:55.168
"Don't do a lesbian story
in the first issue."

1:26:55.168 --> 1:26:57.254
So, I feel like we need
to do a lesbian story, right?

1:26:57.254 --> 1:26:58.713
-Absolutely.
-I agree.

1:26:58.713 --> 1:27:00.006
Excellent.

1:27:00.006 --> 1:27:02.509
And that leaves room
for one more story.

1:27:02.509 --> 1:27:05.011

-No, let's,

What do we--

1:27:29.870 --> 1:27:31.538
-what do we want it to be?
-Abortion.

1:27:32.289 --> 1:27:34.624
-What about it?
-Flo's right. We all know

and no one ever talks about it.

1:27:37.127 --> 1:27:39.880
What if we got a large group
of prominent women

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:42.340
to sign a proclamation saying,
"I've had an abortion."

1:27:42.757 --> 1:27:44.759
Don't you think people
will be turned off by this?

1:27:44.759 --> 1:27:46.928
This could be the first
and last issue.

1:27:46.928 --> 1:27:49.097
-As it is for a lot of women.
-Everyone, we're here

not just dinner.

How many of us here
have had an abortion?

1:28:02.319 --> 1:28:05.739
Okay. You do realize
we're asking people to admit

1:28:07.449 --> 1:28:09.367

it's illegal.

it's a movement.

Are we gonna do this for real?

it's pretty sad.

-Why?
-"The disruptors of the women's

1:35:56.876 --> 1:35:59.420
movement are the ones
trying to push lesbianism

1:35:59.420 --> 1:36:00.672
or hatred of men

1:36:00.672 --> 1:36:02.757
-onto the movement."
-Okay. Okay. Stop it.

1:36:03.007 --> 1:36:04.258
She thinks you're profiteering

1:36:04.258 --> 1:36:05.885
off the movement
with Ms. magazines.

1:36:05.885 --> 1:36:07.762
As if this magazine
will ever turn profit.

1:36:07.762 --> 1:36:10.014
You need to respond
to her in public.

1:36:10.014 --> 1:36:11.641
No, I won't respond.

1:36:11.641 --> 1:36:15.186
I-- I refuse to feed the idea
that women can't get along.

1:36:15.186 --> 1:36:18.064
Sometimes we don't get along.
We argue. We fight.

1:36:18.606 --> 1:36:21.985
And that reminds me, I came here
to tell you in person

1:36:21.985 --> 1:36:24.487
you have been elected
in absentia to represent

1:36:24.487 --> 1:36:25.989
the National Women's
Political Caucus

1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:29.826
-at the Democratic Convention.
-No. No, no, no.

1:36:29.826 --> 1:36:31.536
Betty was actually the ad
campaign that'd be elected

1:36:31.536 --> 1:36:32.745
-and she lost.
-[Gloria] I don't want

1:36:32.745 --> 1:36:34.288
-that job, Bella.
-[cupboard closes]

1:36:34.288 --> 1:36:35.331
That's-- that's why I didn't go.

1:36:35.623 --> 1:36:37.583
That is exactly why
you should have that job.

1:36:37.583 --> 1:36:40.253
And exactly how does
that make sense?

1:36:40.503 --> 1:36:43.798
A reluctant spokeswoman is more
likely to represent the group.

1:36:43.798 --> 1:36:46.467
I have no desire to make
an enemy out of Betty Friedan.

1:36:47.301 --> 1:36:48.344
Too late.

1:36:49.429 --> 1:36:51.264
If you avoid conflict,
my darling,

1:36:51.848 --> 1:36:53.516
conflict will seek you out.

1:36:54.642 --> 1:36:56.144
One may be amused this year...

1:36:56.144 --> 1:36:58.646
the Democratic National
Convention here in Miami,

1:36:58.646 --> 1:37:00.982
by the high-octave span
of women's voices

1:37:01.441 --> 1:37:03.359
gathered together
at the derelict

1:37:03.359 --> 1:37:05.028
Betsy Ross Hotel,

1:37:05.028 --> 1:37:07.030
headquarters
of the recently formed

1:37:07.030 --> 1:37:08.823
National Women's
Political Caucus.

1:37:09.282 --> 1:37:10.533
[telephone ringing]

1:37:10.533 --> 1:37:11.909
[reporter continues]
One might be amused

1:37:11.909 --> 1:37:13.953
by the rooms
with unmade beds,

1:37:13.953 --> 1:37:16.706
yogurt cartons, chests covered
with blue jeans and bras,

1:37:16.998 --> 1:37:18.458
but only briefly.

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:20.418
Betsy Ross Hotel
is a power set.

1:37:20.793 --> 1:37:22.503
More than a third
of the delegates

1:37:22.503 --> 1:37:23.629
this year are women.

1:37:23.921 --> 1:37:26.340
There's a strong women's plank
in the platform.

1:37:26.716 --> 1:37:27.717
Four years ago, there was none.

1:37:27.717 --> 1:37:28.593
[telephone ringing]

1:37:29.343 --> 1:37:32.013
Can they do it or will they be
torn apart by internal strife?

1:37:33.765 --> 1:37:36.059
-[indistinct chatter]
-What a day.

1:37:36.059 --> 1:37:37.852
[Bella] Can you put the rest
of these in the packet?

1:37:37.852 --> 1:37:39.145
There should be four pages each.

1:37:39.145 --> 1:37:41.105
What the hell
did Betty do today?

1:37:41.105 --> 1:37:42.857
Well, threatened to call
a press conference

1:37:42.857 --> 1:37:44.400
and expose the caucus.

1:37:45.985 --> 1:37:47.487
Same as she does every day.

1:37:49.781 --> 1:37:51.491
-[sighs]
-[telephone ringing]

1:37:51.741 --> 1:37:52.992
You know why Betty
doesn't yell at me?

1:37:53.451 --> 1:37:55.995
-Why?
-Because I yell back louder!

1:37:56.579 --> 1:37:58.414
[all laugh]

1:37:58.873 --> 1:38:00.208
Oh, eat your beer nuts.

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.335
Look, we didn't get
all our planks,

1:38:02.752 --> 1:38:04.045
but we will in Houston.

1:38:04.587 --> 1:38:05.963
You're working from within
the movement now.

1:38:06.339 --> 1:38:08.007
Change comes from within.

1:38:08.424 --> 1:38:09.592
[telephone ringing]

1:38:10.009 --> 1:38:11.969
[woman] They want you
for the cover of Newsweek.

1:38:11.969 --> 1:38:13.930
I won't do a cover photograph.

1:38:13.930 --> 1:38:17.475
Yeah. A movement is lots
and lots of people moving.

1:38:17.475 --> 1:38:20.103
Not one person
being photographed.

1:38:20.103 --> 1:38:23.189
Not one white woman. Not me.

1:38:23.898 --> 1:38:25.566
There would be a movement
without me.

1:38:26.692 --> 1:38:29.487
They won't do the story
unless you pose for the cover.

1:38:29.821 --> 1:38:31.531
[sighs] I won't do it.

1:38:32.657 --> 1:38:34.992
If they want us
to become the radicals,

1:38:34.992 --> 1:38:39.497
that they fear we are,
then let them stop the ERA

1:38:40.081 --> 1:38:43.292
and we will become
those radicals.

1:38:43.668 --> 1:38:45.419
[crowd cheers]

1:38:46.754 --> 1:38:52.051
This is no simple reform.
It really is a revolution.

1:38:52.593 --> 1:38:56.180
-[crowd cheer]
-[camera shutter clicks]

1:39:02.687 --> 1:39:05.648
Introducing my lovely
young assistant, Gloria.

1:39:06.607 --> 1:39:07.567
Hold still.

1:39:09.652 --> 1:39:11.612
[audience gasps]

1:39:16.826 --> 1:39:19.120
-[audience clapping]
-[woman] Come on, Gloria.

1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:22.248
This isn't the first time you've
had knives thrown at you, is it?

1:39:22.248 --> 1:39:24.584
Yeah. It was one thing to have
a magician in east 'Ledo

1:39:24.584 --> 1:39:26.669
throw knives at you
when you're being paid for it.

1:39:26.669 --> 1:39:28.713
You know, and anyway those
knives were dull.

1:39:28.713 --> 1:39:30.423
And it's-- it's another thing
to have this...

1:39:30.423 --> 1:39:32.049
Oh, let me see that thing.

1:39:32.049 --> 1:39:33.634
Wait, my glasses.

1:39:35.887 --> 1:39:37.388
Oh, I don't really need

1:39:37.388 --> 1:39:39.265
-my glasses. [laughs]
-[laughs]

1:39:39.265 --> 1:39:41.392
Pin the cock on the feminist.

1:39:43.352 --> 1:39:44.812
Ah. Let them be idiots.

1:39:45.062 --> 1:39:47.565
You know, the purpose
of an ass kicking isn't that

1:39:47.565 --> 1:39:49.192
you get your ass kicked
at the right time

1:39:49.192 --> 1:39:52.278
or for the right reason,
it's to keep your ass sensitive.

1:39:52.278 --> 1:39:56.365
It's in full, you know,
detail and it has my hair,

1:39:56.365 --> 1:39:59.368
-and my glasses.
-Yeah. And my labia.

1:39:59.869 --> 1:40:03.664
-[Flo] Yeah.
-[all laugh]

1:40:04.624 --> 1:40:08.502
[crowd] Two, four, six, eight,
ratify in every state....

1:40:08.502 --> 1:40:10.880
[news reporter] The women
here represent the thousands

1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:14.050
who formed the long line
of runners from Seneca Falls

1:40:14.050 --> 1:40:15.676
officially opening the first

1:40:15.676 --> 1:40:17.970
government sponsored convention
on women's rights.

1:40:17.970 --> 1:40:19.180
[news reporter 2]
Gloria Steinem, now

1:40:19.180 --> 1:40:20.223
that the conference
is about to begin,

1:40:20.514 --> 1:40:22.016
-how do you feel?
-Well, I can't tell you

1:40:22.016 --> 1:40:25.019
how thrilling it is to finally
see this miracle happen.

1:40:25.019 --> 1:40:26.938
-I mean, I've never seen--
-[chants]

1:40:26.938 --> 1:40:29.440
None of us have ever seen
women pull off

1:40:29.732 --> 1:40:32.485
such a massive
nationwide two-year process

1:40:32.485 --> 1:40:35.154
culminating in what is probably
the most racially,

1:40:35.154 --> 1:40:38.199
economically, and geographically
representative body

1:40:38.199 --> 1:40:40.201
that this nation has ever seen.

1:40:40.201 --> 1:40:44.330
So, the bar is very high.
We have a lot to accomplish.

1:40:44.330 --> 1:40:46.958
[indistinct chatter]

1:40:48.501 --> 1:40:50.670
[Bella exclaims, chuckles]
Oh, my knees.

1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:52.421
Bella, how the hell are we gonna

1:40:52.421 --> 1:40:54.090
-get 2,000 delegates to agree...
-[pants]

1:40:54.090 --> 1:40:56.842
..on 26 multi issue planks
in three days?

1:40:56.842 --> 1:40:59.929
By arguing, and voting,
by not shutting up.

1:40:59.929 --> 1:41:01.847
It's called democracy.

1:41:02.098 --> 1:41:06.727
Oh, the Girl Scouts.
God, I love a pageant. [laughs]

1:41:07.061 --> 1:41:07.979
Stop the bus.

1:41:08.521 --> 1:41:11.107
This is going to be a disaster.
Stop the bus

1:41:11.107 --> 1:41:15.611
-now!
-[crowd] Now ERA! Now ERA now!

1:41:15.611 --> 1:41:18.239
[crowd cheering]

1:41:26.289 --> 1:41:31.002
Women are human.
We are united on that.

1:41:33.296 --> 1:41:38.926
No one person and no subgroup
at this conference

1:41:38.926 --> 1:41:42.096
has the right answer.

1:41:42.805 --> 1:41:45.599
Wonder Woman
is not a delegate here.

1:41:45.891 --> 1:41:47.685
[crowd cheering]

1:41:48.561 --> 1:41:50.813
We will not be brainwashed

1:41:51.063 --> 1:41:55.776
by those who predict chaos
and failure for us.

1:41:56.235 --> 1:41:59.864
Tell them they lie and move on.

1:41:59.864 --> 1:42:02.742
[crowd cheering]

1:42:03.534 --> 1:42:04.827
The cause...

1:42:05.661 --> 1:42:09.790
the cause of equal
and human rights...

1:42:10.916 --> 1:42:13.586
will reap what is sown.

1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:19.508
November 18 through November 21,

1:42:20.134 --> 1:42:23.846
1977.

1:42:25.222 --> 1:42:26.599
What will you reap?

1:42:28.434 --> 1:42:30.227
What will you sow?

1:42:30.728 --> 1:42:33.689
[crowd cheering]

1:42:38.152 --> 1:42:44.116
This gavel was used by
Susan B. Anthony in 1896.

1:42:47.078 --> 1:42:50.748
Bella Abzug,
may you preside with the truth

1:42:50.748 --> 1:42:53.834
of what this gavel means
to American women

1:42:53.834 --> 1:42:56.587
who are again on the move.

1:42:57.046 --> 1:42:59.548
[crowd cheering]

1:43:07.181 --> 1:43:08.349
The women's movement...

1:43:09.225 --> 1:43:12.103
has become an indestructible
part of American life.

1:43:13.521 --> 1:43:16.941
It is the homemaker
deciding that raising children,

1:43:17.274 --> 1:43:19.443
cooking, and cleaning,
and all the other things

1:43:19.443 --> 1:43:23.864
she does for her family, should
be accorded value and respect.

1:43:24.949 --> 1:43:27.368
It is the young woman student

1:43:27.368 --> 1:43:29.453
deciding that she wants
to play baseball,

1:43:29.870 --> 1:43:34.208
carry a torch, major in physics,
or become a brain surgeon.

1:43:34.750 --> 1:43:36.752
-It is the working woman...
-[crowd clapping]

1:43:36.752 --> 1:43:38.587
...demanding equal pay.

1:43:39.380 --> 1:43:40.965
It is the divorced woman,

1:43:41.715 --> 1:43:45.177
fighting for social security
benefits in her own right.

1:43:45.761 --> 1:43:49.056
It is the mother organizing
a daycare center.

1:43:49.056 --> 1:43:51.559
It is the battered wife
seeking help.

1:43:51.809 --> 1:43:54.145
It is the woman running
for public office.

1:43:55.229 --> 1:43:57.273
It is the woman on welfare

1:43:57.273 --> 1:44:00.025
looking for a decent part
of American life.

1:44:00.317 --> 1:44:02.319
Let this conference
be the beginning

1:44:02.319 --> 1:44:04.071
of making our democracy

1:44:04.071 --> 1:44:07.116
what it should have been
200 years ago!

1:44:10.911 --> 1:44:12.037
[news reporter]
Seven miles south

1:44:12.371 --> 1:44:14.165
from the National
Women's Conference in Houston,

1:44:14.165 --> 1:44:16.917
a protest, spearheaded
by Phyllis Schlafly,

1:44:17.168 --> 1:44:19.128
calls itself
the pro-family rally

1:44:19.462 --> 1:44:21.213
opposed
to the Equal Rights Amendment.

1:44:21.464 --> 1:44:24.425
I'm very proud
that they excluded me

1:44:24.425 --> 1:44:25.885
from that convention

1:44:25.885 --> 1:44:29.763
and I'm here where we're
not ashamed and not afraid

1:44:30.139 --> 1:44:34.477
to ask God's blessing on this
crowd assembled here today.

1:44:36.896 --> 1:44:40.149
-Oh, my God. That's Dolores.
-Huerta, Right.

1:44:40.691 --> 1:44:42.818
She said she'd be coming
to Houston with the contention

1:44:42.818 --> 1:44:45.404
of female farm workers,
to protest abortion.

1:44:45.404 --> 1:44:46.697
-[Robert] I watched...
-Yeah, well, she has

1:44:46.697 --> 1:44:48.073
-a lot of kids.
-Ten.

1:44:48.073 --> 1:44:49.241
...of young people

1:44:49.241 --> 1:44:51.160
and the greatest tragedy
of all

1:44:51.827 --> 1:44:56.123
...was to see three former
first ladies of this nation,

1:44:56.123 --> 1:44:58.876
excuse me,
two former first ladies

1:44:59.126 --> 1:45:00.294
and the current wife

1:45:00.294 --> 1:45:02.254
of the president
of the United States

1:45:02.713 --> 1:45:04.965
standing by their very presence

1:45:05.216 --> 1:45:09.929
alongside of Abzug
approving of sexual perversion

1:45:09.929 --> 1:45:12.890
and the murder of young people
in their mother's womb.

1:45:12.890 --> 1:45:14.767
-[crowd clamoring]
-What a disgrace!

1:45:15.226 --> 1:45:17.436
Excuse me.
Can we turn this shit off?

1:45:23.859 --> 1:45:24.818
[door closes]

1:45:38.332 --> 1:45:39.667
[toilet flushes]

1:45:40.167 --> 1:45:44.672
[indistinct chatter]

1:45:47.758 --> 1:45:49.677
[woman] It's different
than all of them, you know.

1:45:50.135 --> 1:45:51.512
Excuse me. I'm--
I'm sorry to bother you.

1:45:51.512 --> 1:45:52.846
Did you not get
a room assignment?

1:45:53.097 --> 1:45:54.265
No. But this is fine.

1:45:54.265 --> 1:45:56.016
Well, is there anything
you need?

1:45:56.767 --> 1:45:58.852
We could use someone
to take notes actually.

1:45:58.852 --> 1:46:00.563
Well, that's why I'm here.

1:46:01.188 --> 1:46:02.189
Thank you.

1:46:02.523 --> 1:46:04.483
-Wilma Mankiller.
-Gloria Steinem.

1:46:04.733 --> 1:46:07.903
We need to make it clear that
while other women here gathered

1:46:07.903 --> 1:46:10.698
are fighting for equality
inside the mainstream,

1:46:10.698 --> 1:46:13.284
we native women are fighting
for tribal sovereignty.

1:46:13.826 --> 1:46:17.037
We're fighting for our entire
culture outside the mainstream.

1:46:17.663 --> 1:46:18.747
So, chime in.

1:46:19.290 --> 1:46:22.334
Let's draw up a list
of our most critical issues.

1:46:23.669 --> 1:46:25.629
What about the loss
of our tribal languages?

1:46:26.213 --> 1:46:28.382
We're not even allowed
to teach it in our schools.

1:46:28.966 --> 1:46:32.094
Our language is the very heart
of who we are as a people.

1:46:32.636 --> 1:46:36.765
And if that disappears,
that's it. It's gone forever.

1:46:37.641 --> 1:46:39.059
[women agreeing]

1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:41.020
[indistinct chatter]

1:46:41.020 --> 1:46:42.605
-Gloria.
-Dolores?

1:46:42.605 --> 1:46:43.814
They told me I'd find you

1:46:43.814 --> 1:46:45.608
in one of these hallways
running ragged.

1:46:45.608 --> 1:46:47.568
I thought you're across town,
are you okay?

1:46:47.568 --> 1:46:50.070
Do you have a minute?
I'm just...

1:46:50.487 --> 1:46:52.281
Yes. Yeah. Of course.

1:46:52.281 --> 1:46:53.949
One of these rooms
has gotta be empty.

1:46:53.949 --> 1:46:54.825
All right.

1:46:55.326 --> 1:46:57.036
We've got to have some
very specific resolutions

1:46:57.036 --> 1:46:59.830
for Asian-American women
on sweatshops--

1:47:00.456 --> 1:47:02.207
Oh, Gloria.
We could use a writer.

1:47:02.708 --> 1:47:04.376
I'll be back in a minute. Sorry.

1:47:06.629 --> 1:47:09.173
I promise to be a scribe
for the minority caucuses.

1:47:09.173 --> 1:47:10.883
-I should go now.
-No, no, no, no. Come here.

1:47:11.175 --> 1:47:13.594
-[indistinct chatter]
-Excuse me.

1:47:25.189 --> 1:47:26.940
You know, I'm a devout Catholic.

1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:29.401
You know, along with Cesar,

1:47:29.902 --> 1:47:32.237
I've been anti-abortion
my entire life.

1:47:33.614 --> 1:47:35.324
I'm here with
my fellow farm workers

1:47:35.324 --> 1:47:37.785
to demonstrate in support
of the Right to Lifers, but...

1:47:40.537 --> 1:47:43.040
I looked at the faces
in that angry crowd...

1:47:44.792 --> 1:47:46.418
and I saw some
of the same people

1:47:46.418 --> 1:47:48.337
who fight our unions,
and hate our cause,

1:47:48.337 --> 1:47:50.589
extreme right-wingers,
even the clan and...

1:47:52.299 --> 1:47:53.384
I had to get out.

1:47:53.926 --> 1:47:55.678
Hmm. Dolores, you know...

1:47:56.512 --> 1:47:58.722
no one in their--
in their right mind

1:47:58.722 --> 1:48:00.391
is-- is pro-abortion.

1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:02.935
Nobody gets up in the morning
and says,

1:48:03.477 --> 1:48:05.396
"Great. I'm gonna have
a procedure today." It's...

1:48:06.355 --> 1:48:08.148
it is the method
of the last resort.

1:48:10.275 --> 1:48:13.737
But reproductive freedom and--
and the right to choose

1:48:13.737 --> 1:48:15.364
belongs to the woman, right?

1:48:16.198 --> 1:48:17.241
I mean, that's...

1:48:18.158 --> 1:48:20.619
that's what being pro-choice
is-- is all about.

1:48:23.288 --> 1:48:24.748
I have ten kids.

1:48:25.999 --> 1:48:28.544
And I love each and every one
of them dearly, but...

1:48:28.544 --> 1:48:30.629
...but it's been hard.

1:48:32.589 --> 1:48:34.174
We don't wanna go
against the church...

1:48:35.968 --> 1:48:37.636
but we have to think
of ourselves first.

1:48:38.762 --> 1:48:40.305
All these people who have
an issue

1:48:40.305 --> 1:48:41.348
with having an abortion, well,

1:48:41.348 --> 1:48:42.850
what are they doing
for the children

1:48:42.850 --> 1:48:43.851
once they are born?

1:48:44.852 --> 1:48:45.978
Even the church.

1:48:47.312 --> 1:48:50.023
What's the church doing
to help us raise our children?

1:48:50.858 --> 1:48:52.317
Are they providing
infant centers?

1:48:52.317 --> 1:48:54.194
Are they providing resources
for our teenagers--

1:48:54.194 --> 1:48:55.571
Dolores, come with me tomorrow.

1:48:55.571 --> 1:48:56.864
It's the last day
of the conference

1:48:56.864 --> 1:48:58.365
and-- and I want you there.

1:48:59.199 --> 1:49:01.452
The president and congress...

1:49:01.452 --> 1:49:05.080
should provide
for full quality education.

1:49:05.456 --> 1:49:09.793
And for the full implementation
and enforcement

1:49:09.793 --> 1:49:11.545

Deportation of mothers

1:49:17.301 --> 1:49:18.469
must be stopped,

1:49:18.927 --> 1:49:21.930
and legislation enacted
for parents

this resolution, please rise.

1:49:40.783 --> 1:49:42.576
[crowd cheering]

1:49:42.576 --> 1:49:46.455
The federal government should
guarantee tribal rights...

Asian-Pacific American women
are wrongly thought to be...

1:49:50.626 --> 1:49:52.461

The current system of insurance

1:49:52.711 --> 1:49:55.547
is one where women pay more
and get less.

...of covering homemakers
and their own rights...

1:49:58.842 --> 1:50:01.595

[woman] And your time
has expired. Sit down.

1:50:04.014 --> 1:50:07.351
[Bella] I move the adoption
of the following resolution.

1:50:07.351 --> 1:50:09.895
The Equal Rights Amendment
should be ratified.

1:50:09.895 --> 1:50:12.648

will you please rise?

Thank you for standing
beside us.

1:51:00.779 --> 1:51:01.780
Thank you.

1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:04.449
And you can wear this...

1:51:05.367 --> 1:51:07.995
when we get you out there

-And we will.

-What?
-The ERA.

1:51:16.795 --> 1:51:19.715
Of course.
They voted, didn't they?

1:51:19.715 --> 1:51:22.384
I mean, more people stood up
for it than against it.

1:51:23.552 --> 1:51:25.637
Yeah. But did it pass?

[Charlie] It's going to be
an uphill battle.

1:51:43.947 --> 1:51:46.700
There's never been an elected
female Cherokee chief before.

1:51:47.034 --> 1:51:48.160
[Gloria] There will be now.

1:51:48.994 --> 1:51:50.203

1:51:50.954 --> 1:51:53.290
We've had our car torched,

1:51:54.541 --> 1:51:57.252
Wilma just pushes on.
Nothing stops her.

1:51:57.711 --> 1:51:58.670
No fear.

1:51:59.046 --> 1:52:01.798
Well, she's lucky
to have you beside her.

1:52:03.634 --> 1:52:05.844
[Wilma] Hello.
[speaking foreign language]

1:52:06.678 --> 1:52:07.846
Good to see you.

1:52:07.846 --> 1:52:08.847
[Charlie] No, I'm the lucky one.

1:52:08.847 --> 1:52:10.474
[man] How are you?
Thank you.

1:52:10.891 --> 1:52:12.643
So, how did you two
get together?

1:52:13.352 --> 1:52:16.605
When I met Wilma ten years ago,
she was definitely on her own.

1:52:18.482 --> 1:52:20.400
Well, after working together
for a couple of years

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:21.568
on a water project,

1:52:22.486 --> 1:52:24.321
I started to say, "You know,

1:52:24.655 --> 1:52:27.366
I can tell there's electricity
going on between us."

1:52:27.950 --> 1:52:29.868
And so I asked her. I said,

1:52:29.868 --> 1:52:32.412
"Uh. Wilma, you want to go
see a movie?

1:52:33.747 --> 1:52:35.248
-You want to go see Rambo?"
-[laughs]

1:52:36.124 --> 1:52:39.336
She said "Rambo?
I hate Rambo."

1:52:40.253 --> 1:52:41.296
I thought, "Oops."

1:52:41.672 --> 1:52:43.090
And so I drove to Tulsa

1:52:43.090 --> 1:52:45.300
and pulled in
at a Coney Island hot dog place.

1:52:45.884 --> 1:52:47.719
She said,
"What are we doing here?"

1:52:48.178 --> 1:52:49.388
I said, "We're here to eat."

1:52:50.013 --> 1:52:52.265
She said, "Here?"
I said, "Yeah."

1:52:54.810 --> 1:52:58.313
-She said, "I hate hot dogs."
-[laughs]

1:52:58.313 --> 1:52:59.523
I said, "Oh, my God."

1:53:00.190 --> 1:53:03.735
I struck out here.
I mean I love those hot dogs.

1:53:04.194 --> 1:53:05.278
Dang.

1:53:06.113 --> 1:53:08.740
We live in a country
where our contributions

1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:10.909
to democracy
have been overlooked.

1:53:10.909 --> 1:53:12.327
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

1:53:12.327 --> 1:53:15.455
Benjamin Franklin acknowledged
the Iroquois Confederacy

1:53:15.455 --> 1:53:18.208
was the model for
the Constitutional Convention.

1:53:18.208 --> 1:53:20.419
In fact, he invited
two Iroquois men

1:53:20.419 --> 1:53:21.837
to Philadelphia as advisers.

1:53:22.879 --> 1:53:24.423
-[rain pattering]
-Their first question...

1:53:24.423 --> 1:53:26.550
-[indistinct chatter]
-..."Where are the women?"

1:53:28.176 --> 1:53:30.595
Now, we Cherokee,
we consult our women elders

1:53:30.595 --> 1:53:34.016
on every important decision,
but we've never had a woman

1:53:34.266 --> 1:53:35.976
as a democratically
elected chief.

1:53:35.976 --> 1:53:37.561
Let's change that this year.

1:53:37.561 --> 1:53:38.937

1:53:40.731 --> 1:53:42.357
Vote Mankiller.

1:53:42.357 --> 1:53:43.859
How'd you get the name
Mankiller?

1:53:45.694 --> 1:53:47.863
-I earned it.
-[people laugh]

1:53:47.863 --> 1:53:51.324

1:53:51.324 --> 1:53:52.451
Okay.

1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:54.411

-protector of the village.
-Oh.

-Hmm. You know...
-[sighs]

1:54:06.923 --> 1:54:09.509
...I read that
the Cherokee nation

1:54:09.509 --> 1:54:11.094
was once matrilineal,
is that true?

1:54:11.470 --> 1:54:12.512
Yes. Once.

1:54:14.431 --> 1:54:16.433
And the sun is female
and the moon is male.

1:54:16.433 --> 1:54:17.434
What?

1:54:18.310 --> 1:54:20.228
See, the sun is always there.

1:54:40.082 --> 1:54:41.208
Do you ever go home, Gloria?

1:54:41.208 --> 1:54:43.627
Oh, you mean my apartment
in New York?

1:54:43.627 --> 1:54:46.046
I think the-- the longest
I've been there

1:54:46.046 --> 1:54:47.714
in the last year
has been eight days.

to give our homily.

I-- I'm surprised, too.

1:56:30.567 --> 1:56:33.570
Original culture saw
the presence of God

1:56:33.570 --> 1:56:35.530
in all living things...

1:56:36.406 --> 1:56:38.200
-including women.
-[man clears throat]

1:56:38.491 --> 1:56:42.037
Only in the last 500
to 5,000 years,

1:56:42.037 --> 1:56:43.455
depending on where you lived,

1:56:43.747 --> 1:56:46.708
has godliness been withdrawn
from nature,

1:56:47.167 --> 1:56:50.754
from females and from
particular races of men, right?

1:56:51.463 --> 1:56:56.718
Though patriarchal culture
made hierarchy seem inevitable.

1:56:57.802 --> 1:56:59.262
For 95 percent of history,

1:56:59.262 --> 1:57:02.349
humans have been
more likely to see

1:57:02.349 --> 1:57:05.810
the circle as our natural
paradigm.

1:57:05.810 --> 1:57:08.563
And millions still do
from Native Americans here

1:57:09.189 --> 1:57:12.108
to original cultures
around the world.

1:57:13.109 --> 1:57:16.363
When God is depicted
only as a white man...

1:57:17.364 --> 1:57:19.991
and Jesus has blonde hair
and blue eyes

1:57:19.991 --> 1:57:21.159
in the middle
of the Middle East,

1:57:21.159 --> 1:57:22.202

1:57:22.202 --> 1:57:23.161

1:57:28.333 --> 1:57:30.710
try to trump
women's birth giving power

1:57:30.710 --> 1:57:34.089
by baptizing
with imitation birth fluid

1:57:34.089 --> 1:57:35.465
and calling us reborn.

1:57:36.007 --> 1:57:39.261
And then going women one better
by promising everlasting life.

1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:43.390
In reality, elaborate concepts
of heaven and hell

1:57:43.848 --> 1:57:48.186
didn't exist before patriarchy.
You just joined your ancestors

1:57:48.478 --> 1:57:52.524

1:58:02.158 --> 1:58:04.953

1:58:04.953 --> 1:58:07.872

1:58:31.104 --> 1:58:33.648
-Oh, well--
-And I'll say it real quick.

1:58:33.648 --> 1:58:35.692
First of all, I really believe

1:58:35.692 --> 1:58:38.111
that your movement
was a total failure

1:58:38.111 --> 1:58:41.072
and I believe you could admit
that wholeheartedly.

1:58:41.656 --> 1:58:44.659
You are one
of the primary causes

1:58:44.659 --> 1:58:47.537
of the downfall
of our beautiful

1:58:47.537 --> 1:58:50.582

and society today.

1:58:51.666 --> 1:58:55.003
A couple questions. I'd like
to know if you're married.

1:58:55.795 --> 1:58:57.547
-No.
-If you have children.

1:58:58.423 --> 1:59:00.759
-No.
-No, you don't.

1:59:01.009 --> 1:59:01.926
Well, let me tell you.

1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:03.511
-You can't get...
-Is that-- Is that bad?

1:59:03.511 --> 1:59:07.974
...advertisers because
your magazine blanks.

1:59:08.683 --> 1:59:11.144
So, you better go out
and get a job

1:59:11.144 --> 1:59:13.396

have children, lady.

and I always feel the pressure

Well, not everyone

1:59:46.638 --> 1:59:48.681

not every woman

1:59:48.681 --> 1:59:50.600

1:59:50.600 --> 1:59:52.644
You'd make a terrible opera

2:00:03.947 --> 2:00:06.241
Gloria, what would you say
to women of color

2:00:06.241 --> 2:00:08.701
who don't feel the feminist
movement includes them

2:00:08.952 --> 2:00:09.994
or is about them?

2:00:10.578 --> 2:00:13.581
Well, I wouldn't say anything.
I would-- I would just listen.

[Gloria] The biggest

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:19.379

2:00:19.379 --> 2:00:23.758

lack of natural resources,

2:00:23.758 --> 2:00:28.304
is not religion
or even degree of democracy.

2:00:28.304 --> 2:00:30.765
It's the degree of violence
against females.

2:00:32.058 --> 2:00:34.102
Okay. Here's my best thing
about instinct.

2:00:34.102 --> 2:00:36.688

2:00:36.688 --> 2:00:37.856

2:00:37.856 --> 2:00:40.567

it's a pig.

2:10:30.865 --> 2:10:35.286
statistically speaking, home is
an even more dangerous place

2:10:35.286 --> 2:10:36.746
for women than the road.

2:10:38.039 --> 2:10:39.248
Taking to the road,

2:10:39.498 --> 2:10:42.084
by which I mean letting the road
take you,

2:10:43.002 --> 2:10:44.587
changed who I thought I was.

2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:49.383
The road is messy in the way
that real life is messy.

2:10:50.051 --> 2:10:52.970
It leads us out of denial
and into reality.

2:10:53.471 --> 2:10:55.681
Out of theory and into practice.

2:10:55.931 --> 2:10:59.143
Out of caution and into action.

2:10:59.894 --> 2:11:03.189
Out of statistics and into
stories.

2:11:03.189 --> 2:11:06.317
In short, out of our heads
and into our hearts."

2:11:09.153 --> 2:11:11.197
[speaking foreign language]

2:11:26.337 --> 2:11:27.379
Now...

2:11:28.464 --> 2:11:30.800
be partners forever.

2:11:31.675 --> 2:11:33.135
That's the way it'll be.

2:11:36.806 --> 2:11:38.974
So what happened to you,
Miss Feminist,

2:11:38.974 --> 2:11:42.561
who used to say marriage
turns women into half people?

2:11:42.561 --> 2:11:44.396
-[laughs]
-You were fucking 66 years old.

2:11:44.647 --> 2:11:46.524
A wedding? I'm utterly shocked.

2:11:49.151 --> 2:11:51.570
But partners... I like that.

2:11:52.404 --> 2:11:55.407
What can I say?
We loved each other.

2:11:55.407 --> 2:11:57.743
And, uh, we're both in our 60's

2:11:57.743 --> 2:12:01.497
and hardly needed
to be officially married.

2:12:01.497 --> 2:12:02.790
But David needed a green card.

2:12:03.207 --> 2:12:06.210
And, uh, who could turn down
a full Cherokee wedding?

2:12:06.627 --> 2:12:07.628
Attagirl.

2:12:07.962 --> 2:12:09.839
And besides, we-- we changed
the marriage law,

2:12:09.839 --> 2:12:12.007
so I no longer
had to change my name,

2:12:12.258 --> 2:12:15.136
my legal residence,
my credit rating, right?

2:12:15.511 --> 2:12:17.263
Always the romantic.

2:12:58.470 --> 2:12:59.763
-[speaking foreign language]
-Hi.

2:13:05.019 --> 2:13:06.187
[Gloria] How are you?

2:13:06.645 --> 2:13:08.355
Well, you know
what I always say.

2:13:09.106 --> 2:13:10.733
Every day is a good day.

2:13:12.109 --> 2:13:13.736
[Gloria]
I just spoke to your doctor

2:13:13.736 --> 2:13:16.780
and we can park an ambulance
in the yard, just--

2:13:16.780 --> 2:13:19.241
No. No. [groans]

2:13:20.701 --> 2:13:23.037
I wanna die on my own land.

2:13:26.373 --> 2:13:31.462
Gloria, you are an organizer
to the end. [chuckles]

2:13:37.301 --> 2:13:38.344
Thank you, Billy.

2:13:42.389 --> 2:13:43.682
[Wilma]
Are you thinking of David?

2:13:46.310 --> 2:13:48.479
[Gloria] No. No, I wasn't. I...

2:13:50.856 --> 2:13:52.024
I am...

2:13:53.859 --> 2:13:55.694
always remembering
our wedding here.

2:13:57.363 --> 2:14:01.367
We had one glorious year
together then he got ill.

2:14:03.077 --> 2:14:04.620
Oh, and I just
can't get over it.

2:14:05.496 --> 2:14:07.331
Well, you never should.

2:14:10.042 --> 2:14:11.794
When I see him
on the other side,

2:14:11.794 --> 2:14:14.421
I'll give him a giant bear hug
and tell him.

2:14:14.713 --> 2:14:18.801
-[breathes heavily]
-[wheezes]

2:14:20.719 --> 2:14:22.263
What can I do for you?

2:14:23.222 --> 2:14:25.057
For once there's nothing to do.

2:14:26.642 --> 2:14:28.852
[exhales] Get used to it.

2:14:31.563 --> 2:14:32.940
Actually...

2:14:35.067 --> 2:14:36.443
there is one thing.

2:14:38.070 --> 2:14:39.321
That brace...

2:14:40.906 --> 2:14:42.950
I've had on all these years...

2:14:44.451 --> 2:14:45.494
when I die...

2:14:47.371 --> 2:14:48.497
I want Charlie...

2:14:49.415 --> 2:14:50.708
to take it out back...

2:14:52.376 --> 2:14:53.711
and shoot it.

2:14:55.254 --> 2:14:57.047
Can you make sure
he does that for me?

2:14:57.047 --> 2:14:58.173
Of course I can.

2:14:59.174 --> 2:15:00.175
[exhales]

2:15:05.222 --> 2:15:08.350
I will see you on the other side
of the mountain.

2:15:10.602 --> 2:15:12.479
See you on the other side
of the mountain.

2:15:24.867 --> 2:15:25.826
[gun cocks]

2:15:37.504 --> 2:15:38.714
[gunshot]

2:15:49.058 --> 2:15:50.225
[Gloria] On election night,

2:15:50.768 --> 2:15:53.896
I was sitting with a group of
female ambassadors to the UN.

2:15:54.646 --> 2:15:56.023
Women from different continents

2:15:56.023 --> 2:15:57.983
who are watching
the results in New York.

2:15:58.734 --> 2:16:00.986
I could see from the faces
around me

2:16:01.487 --> 2:16:03.405
that her defeat
was devastating,

2:16:03.822 --> 2:16:06.617
not just in this country,
but worldwide.

2:16:07.868 --> 2:16:10.037
-[keys clicking]
-Yet I know that in the future,

2:16:10.329 --> 2:16:12.873
Hillary's loss will be part
of our victories.

2:16:13.874 --> 2:16:17.127
Because the path up
is always a jagged line.

2:16:17.586 --> 2:16:18.796
Not a straight one.

2:16:19.546 --> 2:16:22.257
Our victory is not a one
person marathon,

2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:23.926
but a relay race.

2:16:25.010 --> 2:16:27.513
When the first
of many diverse women

2:16:27.513 --> 2:16:30.766
wins this highest
of all democratic offices,

2:16:31.308 --> 2:16:33.977
she'll be climbing steps
that were carved out

2:16:33.977 --> 2:16:35.396
by a woman before her.

2:16:35.896 --> 2:16:37.439
[engine revving]

2:16:37.439 --> 2:16:39.108
[young Gloria] I feel like
we're going in circles.

2:16:40.025 --> 2:16:42.236
Haven't we passed that sign
ten times?

2:16:42.569 --> 2:16:44.446
A gazillion times.

2:16:51.995 --> 2:16:54.289
[indistinct chatter]

2:17:14.268 --> 2:17:16.478
[crowd] This is what democracy
looks like.

2:17:16.478 --> 2:17:17.938
[woman] Tell me
what democracy looks like.

2:17:18.313 --> 2:17:20.607
[crowd] This is what democracy
looks like.

2:17:21.150 --> 2:17:25.821
I and my beloved co-chairs,
the golden oldies, right?

2:17:26.405 --> 2:17:27.698
Harry Belafonte,

2:17:27.698 --> 2:17:29.366
-Dolores Huerta.
-[crowd cheering]

2:17:29.366 --> 2:17:33.287
We may be the oldest marchers
here today,

2:17:34.037 --> 2:17:38.959
so I've been thinking about
the uses of a long life.

2:17:39.376 --> 2:17:44.006
And one of them is that you
remember when things were worse.

2:17:44.256 --> 2:17:45.174
[crowd cheers]

2:17:45.799 --> 2:17:48.635
Thank you for understanding

2:17:48.635 --> 2:17:53.474
that sometimes we must put our
bodies where our beliefs are.

2:17:54.224 --> 2:17:58.270
Sometimes pressing send
is not enough.

2:18:01.148 --> 2:18:02.483
We are here

2:18:02.483 --> 2:18:05.068
and around the world
for a deep democracy...

2:18:05.068 --> 2:18:07.112
that says
we will not be quiet...

2:18:08.071 --> 2:18:09.740
we will not be controlled...

2:18:11.241 --> 2:18:12.993
we will work for a world

2:18:13.243 --> 2:18:15.704
in which all countries
are connected.

2:18:16.497 --> 2:18:18.624
God may be in the details

2:18:18.624 --> 2:18:20.792
but the goddess
is in connections.

2:18:21.210 --> 2:18:22.961
[cheering]

2:18:23.879 --> 2:18:26.757
We are linked.
We are not ranked.

2:18:27.132 --> 2:18:31.845
We are the people. We have
people power and we will use it.

2:18:31.845 --> 2:18:33.597
[cheering]

2:18:33.597 --> 2:18:38.268
This is the upside
of the downside.

2:18:39.228 --> 2:18:43.690
This is an outpouring of energy
and true democracy

2:18:43.690 --> 2:18:48.237
like I have never seen
in my very long life.

2:18:49.071 --> 2:18:53.617
It is wide in age,
it is deep in diversity,

2:18:54.201 --> 2:18:56.286
and remember, the constitution

2:18:56.286 --> 2:18:58.413
does not begin with
"I the president,"

2:18:58.413 --> 2:18:59.540
It begins with,

2:18:59.831 --> 2:19:02.501
-"We the people."
-[crowd] We the people!

2:19:20.227 --> 2:19:24.106
[dramatic music playing]

2:21:30.857 --> 2:21:33.610
[upbeat funk music playing]

2:23:03.700 --> 2:23:06.369
[slow folk music playing]

2:25:51.785 --> 2:25:54.162
[dramatic music playing]
