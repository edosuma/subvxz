01:29.255 --> 01:31.621
- Hello?
- Are you sleeping?

01:31.658 --> 01:33.922
No, I'm fly-fishing.
Who is this?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.121
It's Jamie.
I'm sorry to wake you.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.426
No no no.
I'm up.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.865
I'm not sleeping.
Jamie-Lynn Jamie?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.834
Yeah.

01:42.869 --> 01:45.030
- What's going on?
- Nothing

01:45.071 --> 01:48.199
I just got back from Europe
and my internal clock is all off

01:48.241 --> 01:50.607
and I thought if you
weren't sleeping...

01:50.643 --> 01:52.770
I'm not sleeping.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.973
Well, then why
don't you come over?

01:55.014 --> 01:57.312
Is this a trap?
'Cause the last time I saw you

01:57.350 --> 01:58.783
you weren't exactly
thrilled with me.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.150
Well, maybe this time
you'll keep your mouth shut.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.280
And what am I keeping
my mouth shut about?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.314
Just come over.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.758
Is this a booty call?

02:07.794 --> 02:11.457
When are you gonna learn that talking
just gets you into trouble, Turtle?

02:19.839 --> 02:22.774
Where are you going?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.277
Jesus, Vin, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing up?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.006
My call time's in an hour.
I'm getting ready to shoot.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.344
The real question is
what are you doing up?

02:29.382 --> 02:31.680
Oh, since I'm banned from set,
I figured I'd head back

02:31.718 --> 02:33.049
into town and do
that favor Dom needed.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.212
It's 4:00 in the morning.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.189
Yeah, but he said he needed us to take
the car back to the leasing company, right?

02:37.223 --> 02:39.214
Not till the first.
It's the 14th.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.490
Now where are you going?

02:42.529 --> 02:43.860
You know I'd never
lie to you, Vin.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.330
Please don't make me
tell you.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.424
You having gambling
troubles or something?

02:47.467 --> 02:49.230
No no, I'm all good.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.897
All right, as long
as you're all good.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.633
You all good?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.870
Yeah, I'm pumped about
the scene today.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.708
- You get any sleep?
- No.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.078
I watched all my old
movies last night.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.106
Verner was right,
I do have some bad habits.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.583
But today I've got
my head on straight.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.677
You're gonna kill it, Vin.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.210
You too, right?

03:10.623 --> 03:12.648
Trying to trick me into
tell you where I'm going?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.626
Never.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.923
Have fun.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.796
What do you mean he wouldn't tell you
where he was going?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.498
I don't know.
He's got something he's got to do.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.303
What could Turtle possibly have to do
that doesn't involve us?

03:29.342 --> 03:31.367
- Seriously.
- I don't know. Look, I have to focus.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.005
- We're ready for you, Vince.
- Okay.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.447
- And these guys...
- Yeah yeah yeah, we know.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.575
We're persona non grata.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.882
- Send our regards to V.V.
- Sorry.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.478
- We'll be in the trailer.
- All right.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.184
- Wish we could see it, bro.
- You will on the big screen.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.386
- Knock 'em dead, Vince.
- You know it.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.726
Now, Vincent, this is the most critical
moment for your character.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.856
His life is hanging
in balance

03:52.899 --> 03:54.799
both literally
and figuratively.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.825
So we must feel
his vulnerability.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.302
I completely get it.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.806
Because this vulnerability,
it's what lies

04:00.840 --> 04:02.705
at the core of McCabe.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.643
Like an onion, without a core
there's no layers.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.612
Whatever you need,
Verner, I will deliver.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.581
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.278
I appreciate it.
Are we ready to shoot?

04:12.318 --> 04:15.082
- All right, we're good.
- Okay, let's do this.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.589
Harness set.
Here we go.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.785
All right, everyone,
this is for picture.

04:19.826 --> 04:23.125
- This is for picture, everyone.
- Fire!

04:23.162 --> 04:24.891
- Wind.
- Roll camera.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.161
- Roll camera.
- Rolling!

04:27.200 --> 04:30.226
"Smokejumpers"
scene 43 take one. Mark.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.500
Action!

04:40.580 --> 04:43.208
Yeah, Wilson,
it's McCabe.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.876
I'm code three.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.442
Winds took me about 100 yards
from the drop point.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.295
What are you doing?

05:05.338 --> 05:07.772
I was getting ready
to do my walk of shame.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.240
Isn't that what
I'm supposed to do?

05:09.275 --> 05:12.210
Oh, poor Turtle.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.872
Are you feeling used?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.711
No no,
I'm very very happy.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.081
And I want to keep you happy in case
you decide you want to call again.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.643
Look, Turtle, if you have
somewhere to go, you can go.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.657
I got nowhere to go, Jamie.
In fact, I'll move in if you want me to.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.354
I'm hungry.
I want to eat.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.022
I can go get us something
if you want.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.861
I was thinking
we could go out.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.628
Okay.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.464
Yeah, I'd love that.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.265
Get your ass
back here first.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.363
I want to work up
an appetite.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.873
Okay.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.366
"Smokejumpers"
scene 43 take 51.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.107
Cue the fire.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.411
And action!

05:59.592 --> 06:02.390
Wilson, it's McCabe.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.658
I'm code three.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.460
Winds dragged me
about 100 yards

06:06.499 --> 06:08.660
from the drop point
northeast.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.033
I don't think I'm gonna
make it, man.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.163
Can you call my wife?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.003
I need to talk to my wife.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.236
Stop.
Take it from the top.

06:17.276 --> 06:18.800
And more passion.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.746
- Where?
- Everywhere.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.384
All right, come on.
Let's do it.

06:25.418 --> 06:26.749
Okay, action.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.084
Yeah, Wilson,
it's McCabe.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.488
This'll have to be
the last take.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.116
Otherwise we go
into meal penalty.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.184
I don't give a fuck
about meal penalty.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.752
You call my wife.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.264
Tell her I love her.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.856
Take it from the middle.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.358
- From where?
- The middle, "Call my wife."

06:44.404 --> 06:46.770
Okay.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.535
Okay, action.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.906
I got to talk to my wife, Wilson.
I'm not gonna make it.

06:50.943 --> 06:54.606
- Vincent.
- Can you call my wife? Tell her I love...

06:54.647 --> 06:56.410
I need more passion.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.713
There should be
fear or panic.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.412
You think this is it.

07:00.453 --> 07:03.115
And the girl you're calling,
that's your childhood love.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.717
There should be
sorrow, remorse,

07:06.759 --> 07:09.023
sadness.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.762
Action!

07:12.799 --> 07:14.528
Wilson, I don't think
I'm gonna make it, man.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.762
Can you call my wife?

07:16.803 --> 07:19.033
Tell her I love her!

07:19.071 --> 07:20.971
I don't see it.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.373
I can't see it.
I can't see it in your face.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.400
You've got to show me
that you love her.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.879
- Give me what I need.
- I'm trying.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.883
Try harder.
From the middle.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.942
Action!

07:32.985 --> 07:34.976
You got to call
my wife for me.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.648
- It's lunch time.
- Shut up!

07:36.689 --> 07:39.487
You call my wife
and you tell her I love her.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.823
Ah!
Who taught you to act?

07:41.861 --> 07:44.762
- Stop interrupting me.
- Make me stop then.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.391
Make me believe that
what I'm seeing is real.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.459
Make me believe I'm not watching
a fucking high school play.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.336
- Cut me down.
- Oh no, you stay there.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.533
- You finish this scene, God damn it.
- No. No!

07:55.575 --> 07:57.566
- Cut me down.
- Jesus Christ!

07:57.610 --> 07:59.339
Coming down.
Should I call lunch?

07:59.378 --> 08:01.471
- No!
- All right.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.952
Look, you push me all you want, but I don't
appreciate you insulting me personally.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.978
And I don't appreciate you taking
three hours to get a simple scene.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.115
Well, maybe if you knew what
you wanted it would be simple.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.490
I know what I want.
I do know what I want.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.826
I just did 50 takes and you seem to keep
asking me to do something different.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.661
I just need something
that works.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.496
- They all work.
- No they don't.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.867
I don't have one usable take.
Not one.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.805
Look, just tell me what you want exactly
and I will give it to you.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.707
- We're in penalty.
- I wish it were that simple, but it's not.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.735
You can't give me what I want
because you're not capable of it.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.542
Maybe you shouldn't have
done this movie with me.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.139
I tried not to.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.844
But your little friend
at the studio

08:38.885 --> 08:41.409
jammed you down my goddamn
fucking throat.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.011
You were never
right for this role.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.647
- Never.
- Oh, come on. That's bullshit.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.056
You just refuse to believe it because
you wanted someone else.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.618
This is ridiculous.
This is not gonna work, not ever.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.186
Okay, you know what?
You're the dictator,

08:51.230 --> 08:53.095
so you figure out
a way to make it work.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.326
You're right, Vincent.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.530
You're fired.

09:01.841 --> 09:04.173
Now you can call lunch.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.841
There he is.
Welcome home, Andrew.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.649
Feels good, Ari.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.155
Should we hit a titty bar
to celebrate?

09:17.189 --> 09:18.383
Ari.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.392
Talk to your newest boss
Mr. Andrew Klein.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.656
- Ari.
- In fact, everyone listen up.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.960
This is Andrew Klein.
Today and every day, consider him me

09:25.998 --> 09:29.331
and me the me dealing
with more important stuff than you.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.926
- Ari!
- Why are you standing there

09:30.970 --> 09:32.995
like you just swallowed
a dildo anally, Lloyd?

09:33.039 --> 09:34.870
- I told you he was me.
- I'm sorry, Lloyd.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.499
- He told me to say it.
- And his timing was impeccable.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.169
- What's up, Lloyd?
- E called.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.337
- So tell him I'll call him back.
- It's about Vince, Ari.

09:40.379 --> 09:42.711
- I need to talk to you about Vince also, Ari.
- So talk.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.239
My girlfriend works for
Josh Hartnett's agent.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.685
She said they just called offering
him Vince's role in "Smokejumpers."

09:48.721 --> 09:51.019
- What?
- E said it was urgent.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.355
Jesus Christ,
get him on the phone.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.223
Now!

09:59.665 --> 10:01.565
- Verner fired him.
- Why?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.092
- The prick says I can't act.
- Jesus Christ.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.003
Look, he never wanted him in the movie
from the start. It was pure sabotage.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.303
- I'm coming up there.
- Why? We're packing to leave.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.276
Well, don't.
It's not over yet.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.608
- He wants us to wait.
- Wait?

10:14.847 --> 10:16.678
Wait for what?
I just got humiliated.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.308
What, are you gonna come
beg for my job back?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.819
- I don't beg.
- I don't need this that bad.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.321
Yes you do, Vince.
Now please, just wait.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.449
Fine, but you'd
better hurry.

10:25.491 --> 10:28.289
Lloyd, get Jerry Bruckheimer
on the phone

10:28.327 --> 10:30.557
and tell him I need
to get to Big Bear fast.

10:30.596 --> 10:33.622
And beg him to let me
borrow his ride.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.328
- Everything all right?
- No, but it will be.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.530
Wow, you really found an
out-of-the-way spot, huh?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.203
- I like it here.
- Oh yeah?

10:45.244 --> 10:47.439
Yeah. I lived in New Orleans
for a little while

10:47.480 --> 10:50.142
and this is the best
jambalaya in California.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.013
Still out
of the way though.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.951
What's the problem,
Turtle?

10:53.986 --> 10:57.149
No problem. Hey, you want to hide me,
consider me hidden.

10:57.189 --> 11:01.057
- I eat here all the time.
- Really?

11:01.093 --> 11:03.186
- Hi, Jamie baby. How you doing?
- I'm good, Val.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.220
How are you?
Really.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.363
Listen, I just want to apologize again
for opening my big mouth.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.099
Let's not bring it up.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.766
I really only
told my boys.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.775
Yeah, but your boys
told everyone.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.777
And I have a crazy
ex-boyfriend,

11:18.811 --> 11:21.302
and when he found out,
let's just say it was not good.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.440
If you got a problem
with some guy...

11:23.482 --> 11:25.040
He's on the Chargers.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.879
- Is he the kicker?
- Nope.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.719
- I'll keep it low.
- You promise this time?

11:31.757 --> 11:34.521
I pinkie swear.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.190
Why'd you call last night?

11:39.231 --> 11:41.222
My therapist says
I'm attracted to losers.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.393
Lucky me.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.164
I thought you
were cute, Turtle.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.467
So you like me?

11:46.505 --> 11:48.405
I liked you on that plane.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.073
So do you like jambalaya?

11:52.111 --> 11:53.635
You know,
I've never had it,

11:53.679 --> 11:55.010
but if you say it's good
I'll try it.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.607
You always this easy?

11:57.650 --> 12:00.210
Oh yeah, I've been told
I lift the spirits

12:00.252 --> 12:02.345
of everyone around me
since I was yea big.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.084
That's nice.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.321
So your therapist really said you were
attracted to losers?

12:08.360 --> 12:11.056
Yeah, but she's a quack.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.860
Hi. A jambalaya
and an étouffée.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.763
We'll just
split 'em both.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.816
Vinnie Chase.
Where the fuck do I find Vinnie Chase?

12:43.028 --> 12:44.655
What a way to make
an entrance, Ari.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.995
That's nothing compared to what
I'm gonna do to this Kraut director.

12:47.032 --> 12:50.024
It's either you or me.
And if I go in, I'm going in blazing.

12:50.069 --> 12:51.969
- Settle down. Where's Vinnie?
- Right in there.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.001
How you doing, buddy?

13:00.045 --> 13:02.206
I want to get the fuck out
of here is how I'm doing.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.079
Listen, take a deep
breath and relax.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.050
- It's all gonna be fine.
- How?

13:06.085 --> 13:08.553
Because a Jew has arrived
and he doesn't like Germans.

13:08.587 --> 13:09.884
Now where do I find him?

13:09.922 --> 13:12.857
Der Kommissar is leaving
his bunker now.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.553
Hang tight.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.527
Go get him.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.328
Verner Vollstedt,
do you have a minute?

13:20.366 --> 13:22.732
- Who's asking?
- Ari Gold.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.999
Oh, the super-duper agent.

13:26.038 --> 13:29.735
I'm afraid your client already
has used all my spare minutes.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.675
Well, I'll be brief.

13:31.710 --> 13:34.474
Tell Mr. Norton we'll shoot
in less than five minutes.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.674
Okay.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.444
I hear we have a problem.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.452
No, we don't have a problem.
I have a problem

13:40.486 --> 13:43.683
because your client will
not perform the services I request.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.316
My client has performed
just fine in every movie he's ever done

13:46.358 --> 13:48.292
including a blockbuster

13:48.327 --> 13:51.160
for an Oscar-winning
American director.

13:51.197 --> 13:54.428
Well, this is a film
about human beings with layers.

13:54.466 --> 13:57.264
It's not about some
swimming superhero.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.430
I don't care if it's a movie
about a dancing cucumber.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.336
He will deliver
and I need for you

14:01.373 --> 14:03.170
to get back out there
and help him to do that.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.938
I think that's impossible

14:04.977 --> 14:07.537
unless the ghost of
Sir Laurence Olivier

14:07.580 --> 14:10.708
were miraculously
to inhabit his body.

14:10.749 --> 14:12.717
Your client is soulless.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.275
You don't have
the authority to fire him.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.844
The studio
will not let you.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.981
Have you even let them
know that your movie

14:18.023 --> 14:20.014
is in complete disarray?

14:20.059 --> 14:22.857
I have three days to shoot
Mr. Norton in the woods.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.728
And by the time the crew
comes to save his character

14:25.764 --> 14:28.130
the role that Vincent
couldn't play

14:28.167 --> 14:31.330
will be taken by someone
the studio will be very happy with.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.066
Josh Hartnett?
Yeah, I know all.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.404
When you took this movie,
Vinnie Chase was attached,

14:36.442 --> 14:39.707
- and that's how you will finish it.
- Are you threatening me?

14:39.745 --> 14:41.144
If you consider me telling you
that you'll be lucky

14:41.180 --> 14:43.205
to get a Der Wienerschnitzel
commercial in this country

14:43.249 --> 14:46.013
if you don't go back to work,
then yeah, it's a fucking threat.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.546
I don't respond
to threats, Mr. Gold.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.023
This conversation
is over.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.822
Nothing is over.
When I'm done with you

14:55.861 --> 14:57.488
it'll make
the Battle of Normandy

14:57.529 --> 15:00.430
look like a game
of fucking paintball.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.672
Hold on.
Hello?

15:07.706 --> 15:09.469
I have Ari Gold
for you, Miss Gordon.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.873
Oh yes, put him through.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.471
Dana, how's my favorite
studio head who I made?

15:14.513 --> 15:16.674
Great. You know, two days
at our theme park

15:16.715 --> 15:18.546
in Sydney is quite
a stress reliever.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.745
Well, imagine three children
just got tossed off

15:20.786 --> 15:22.583
the roller coaster
and tense up.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.021
What do you mean?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.890
What I mean is your
"Smokejumpers" director

15:27.927 --> 15:30.452
has fucking collapsed
like a house of cards.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.361
Okay, Ari, tell me what the fuck
is happening?

15:32.398 --> 15:34.889
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He doesn't know what he wants.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.902
We need to get him off this thing
and find someone that does.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.200
Jesus Christ.
I am on a plane with John Ellis.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.798
I will be on the ground
in LA in 90 minutes.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.775
In 90 minutes you could be
back blowing hack writers

15:44.810 --> 15:47.802
just to get them to meet you
to have a cup of coffee, Dana.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.143
Wake the fuck up!

15:49.181 --> 15:50.546
All right,
I'm calling the set.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.812
Be by your phone
for when I call you back.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.654
- What did he say?
- Nothing worth interpreting.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.423
All right,
I'm gonna call Shauna.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.555
Have her release a statement
that Vince walked off the movie.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.292
Hold off, E.
No press, all right?

16:07.333 --> 16:10.029
Dana Gordon is on this.
All will be well.

16:12.204 --> 16:15.298
Unless Edward Norton
just blew up.

16:17.609 --> 16:21.045
It's really sweet of you to do this
for your friend. That's such a sad story.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.446
Yeah, he'll bounce back.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.474
In about 15 to 20
years probably.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.982
Oh, damn.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.548
- He's got a big head.
- That looks good on you.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.719
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.661
So are most of your
friends from growing up

16:37.696 --> 16:40.221
big successes like Vince
or more like Dom?

16:40.265 --> 16:43.530
I got a few Doms.
There's only one Vince.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.298
He's like a hero
where I'm from.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.500
People are gonna freak out
when they see him bounce back like this.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.064
And what's your plan?

16:50.109 --> 16:52.134
My plan for what?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.008
For life.
Do you have one?

16:54.046 --> 16:56.606
It might not look it,

16:56.648 --> 16:58.513
but I'm plotting
a few things.

16:58.550 --> 16:59.847
Oh yeah?
Like what?

17:03.389 --> 17:06.290
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you
on the spot like that.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.791
No, it's okay.
It's just...

17:07.826 --> 17:11.454
things haven't exactly
panned out careerwise.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.632
Well, why don't you take over
this limo business

17:14.665 --> 17:16.065
and I will be the driver?

17:16.101 --> 17:18.467
Hot girls driving limos...

17:18.503 --> 17:20.904
I love that.
Call it Lim-hos.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.198
I don't know
about the name.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.369
Yeah, I'm not sure about
having a business partner

17:26.412 --> 17:28.539
who's in jail either.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.242
- I'll find my niche.
- I believe it.

17:31.283 --> 17:34.377
Or maybe you really are
just attracted to losers.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.412
Or maybe I see potential.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.526
James Cameron is
finishing up "Avatar."

17:41.560 --> 17:43.050
Ridley Scott just left
for England.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.926
Ron Howard is doing
"Angels and Demons."

17:44.963 --> 17:48.399
Half the town is out of work.
You can't find me one available director?

17:48.434 --> 17:50.095
Kevin Smith isn't
doing anything.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.262
Are you looking at the DGA list
or are you staring out the window

17:52.304 --> 17:55.102
at the line in front of the Sprinkles
fucking cupcakes store.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.938
- Oh, Ari, you sound so stressed.
- Shut the fuck up, Lloyd.

17:57.976 --> 17:59.534
This gets more
humiliating by the second.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.772
Did Pete Berg call back?

18:00.813 --> 18:03.077
No, but his assistant
assured me he got the message.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.208
You get him.
You get me?

18:05.250 --> 18:08.276
You want me to call
Barbet Schroeder?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.447
I did three days as an extra
on "Barfly."

18:10.489 --> 18:12.719
- How fucking old are you?
- Ari, what are we doing?

18:12.758 --> 18:15.158
I'm not getting rehired.
You're not finding a director.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.957
It's over.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.293
Seriously, at what point do we
take back our self-respect?

18:19.331 --> 18:21.697
We take it back when I say, okay?
Dana Gordon owes me.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.633
You really think she's gonna
let you replace the director?

18:23.669 --> 18:26.570
After what I did for her, she would let
us double penetrate her if I asked her.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.936
- Ew.
- Jesus.

18:27.973 --> 18:29.531
Listen, I'm sorry, Vinnie.
Okay, listen.

18:29.575 --> 18:31.600
We promised this year
we were gonna listen to me, all right?

18:31.643 --> 18:34.635
Now we got to stay put
until Dana Gordon tells us what's what.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.205
That's her right now.
Just chill.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.175
Dana Gordon, give me
something good.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.686
I have nothing good.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.553
That German cocksucker
reamed me out for 45 minutes.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.115
Well, ream him back.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.525
Ari, if John Ellis finds out
about this I'm fucked.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.553
Dana, you are the president
of the studio.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.828
Yeah, doing my first
$100 million movie.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.768
Remember, Verner
works for you, okay?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.896
He's a high-paid
employee,

18:59.938 --> 19:02.429
but like any employee
he can be replaced.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.408
Nobody is replacing
anybody, all right?

19:04.443 --> 19:06.138
- I told Verner that.
- What did he say?

19:06.178 --> 19:08.078
He said he wants to
discuss it face to face.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.741
We wants to give me his side of the story.
He's on his way here now.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.250
- So am I.
- Ari, you don't need to come.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.253
Yes I do need to come.
And I'm gonna bring Vinnie

19:15.287 --> 19:16.914
and he's gonna
tell you the truth.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.446
All right, everybody.
We're moving out.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.049
- Where to?
- The studio.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.694
Jesus Christ!

19:25.731 --> 19:29.030
- Quickly.
- This is ridiculous.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.558
You know, I was the one
in the crew

19:31.603 --> 19:33.537
who made all the money
back in high school.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.837
In fact, if is wasn't for me, Vince
wouldn't have been able to come out West.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.706
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.678
Well, Drama put us up,

19:40.712 --> 19:43.112
but it was my 15 Gs
that covered all the expenses.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.810
You know, the flights,
the food, whatever,

19:45.851 --> 19:48.012
How'd you make all that money
in high school?

19:48.053 --> 19:50.647
Well, it's not like
I sold drugs.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.188
I was a bookie.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.489
Very entrepreneurial.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.222
Not something I want to
carry over as an adult.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.162
I think that was
a good move.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.223
I always wanted to
open a restaurant.

20:01.266 --> 20:04.292
You know, good food,
maybe some delivery.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.065
- Call it "Turtle's."
- Cute.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.039
But doesn't exactly
imply speedy service.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.735
How about Kenny's?

20:11.777 --> 20:14.644
- Your name is Kenny?
- No.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.079
Oh, you're one
of those guys.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.242
You don't even ask what your real name
is 'cause you'll never tell.

20:19.284 --> 20:22.014
I haven't been called by my real name
since I was five years old.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.749
Even my mother
calls me Turtle.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.882
Then I won't ask.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.692
It's Sal.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.130
Sal?

20:36.168 --> 20:37.692
Yup.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.397
I like that.

20:41.006 --> 20:43.998
How'd you like to spend
the weekend in La Jolla with me, Sal?

20:44.042 --> 20:45.634
Really?

20:49.147 --> 20:51.012
Really.

20:51.049 --> 20:52.846
Okay.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.179
They can't do
their best work.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.690
I don't understand
why they are here.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.056
Because it's a free country

21:01.093 --> 21:03.391
and not Germany
circa 1939.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.226
- Okay, Ari, please.
- Listen, I should be on the set.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.234
On my set working.
I shouldn't be here wasting time

21:09.268 --> 21:12.203
explaining why this is
not a workable situation.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.967
Dana, this guy has had it out for Vince
since we started this movie.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.702
Who's this man?

21:16.742 --> 21:19.142
Okay, look, this is silly.

21:19.177 --> 21:21.372
We are a week into
a production that is already

21:21.413 --> 21:23.813
over budget by $2 million.

21:23.849 --> 21:26.579
I'm over budget because I'm saddled
with an actor that can't do the job.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.950
But listen, I got
calls into Leo.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.148
He and I worked together
on a commercial in Austria.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.316
He's in Boston right now
shooting "Shutter Island."

21:33.358 --> 21:36.020
- I got calls into other actors as well.
- Like who?

21:36.061 --> 21:37.756
- Like Joaquin Phoenix.
- Booked.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.230
- Christian Bale
- Booked.

21:40.265 --> 21:43.098
I'll take fucking
Ashton Kutcher over this guy.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.365
All right, that's enough.
Dana, what are you gonna do?

21:45.404 --> 21:47.872
Because I'm not gonna sit here
and let this guy insult Vince anymore.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.500
- Thank you, E.
- And I'm his manager, you jerkoff.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.066
How many people
does it take

21:52.110 --> 21:54.510
to handle one
talentless actor?

21:54.546 --> 21:56.070
Look, Dana, I think
I was doing a great job.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.513
At least I was killing
myself trying to.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.176
But I'm not willing
to take this shit either.

21:59.217 --> 22:00.946
So you tell me
what you want to do.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.544
I know what I want to do.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.181
I want you guys to get back on the set
and finish this movie.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.815
Would be happy to.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.854
No. No.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.126
No!

22:14.166 --> 22:16.794
Well, I got a call
right now from Pete Berg.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.769
Directed a little movie
called "Hancock."

22:18.804 --> 22:21.568
Made about $1 billion.
He was my college roommate.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.699
- What's this crap?
- It's the end of the line.

22:23.742 --> 22:25.039
Pete, how are you, Buddy?

22:25.077 --> 22:27.375
- Hello, Ari.
- My man.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.380
- What's up, man?
- You get my message?

22:29.414 --> 22:32.281
Yeah, I talked to your guy
and I told him I cannot do it.

22:32.317 --> 22:35.377
I promised Joy we're going on vacation.
We're going on vacation right now.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.911
Oh, yeah?
That's fantastic.

22:37.956 --> 22:40.618
No no, I don't think you heard me.
I said I cannot do it.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.627
We're going on vacation.
I said no.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.822
- Give me it.
- I love it.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.524
- I'm getting on the airplane.
- Ari, find someone else.

22:46.565 --> 22:47.827
- He's not interested.
- Love you, Ari.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.857
All right, we'll talk soon.
I love you too, buddy.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.732
All right, he had
already read the script.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.000
He loves it.
Sign off on him.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.667
Tell the Kraut to grab his passport
and get the fuck out.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.733
I'm not going to take
anymore of this shit now.

22:58.777 --> 23:01.541
Oh yes, you fucking are.
Get your ass back here.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.572
I hired you and you have
a movie to finish

23:04.616 --> 23:06.243
that you are getting paid
a lot of money to do

23:06.284 --> 23:08.582
and that is exactly what
is going to fucking happen.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.248
- Do you understand me?
- I do.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.120
Anyone else
turned on right now?

23:13.158 --> 23:15.217
- I want to talk to John Ellis.
- Well, you can't.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.888
No, God damn it.
I can.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.454
John Ellis!

23:23.201 --> 23:25.795
- Where's John Ellis?
- Conference room.

23:25.837 --> 23:28.931
- What the hell's going on?
- He's running for the chairman.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.635
Want me to stop him?

23:30.675 --> 23:33.769
- You cannot go in there.
- John Ellis!

23:33.812 --> 23:35.473
John Ellis!

23:35.514 --> 23:38.142
This guy's insane.

23:38.183 --> 23:41.346
John Ellis!

23:41.386 --> 23:43.684
Hey, what are you doing?

23:43.722 --> 23:45.383
John Ellis!

23:46.725 --> 23:49.785
Verner Vollstedt.
I need a word.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.490
Dana, what the hell
is going on?

23:54.866 --> 23:56.697
You should have
let me take him down.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.532
I don't think it
would have helped much.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.867
It wouldn't have hurt.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.635
I could have shredded
his ACL in a flash.

24:02.674 --> 24:05.837
How does a guy like Ellis make a decision
like that based on three days of footage?

24:05.877 --> 24:07.242
It's his studio.
He can do whatever he wants.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.179
Oh, what if he doesn't
like what I did?

24:09.214 --> 24:11.045
He'll like what you did.
You like what he did, right?

24:11.082 --> 24:12.481
I was banned
from the set mostly.

24:12.517 --> 24:13.984
He'll like what you did.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.249
Word to the mother,
bitch.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.849
Yeah, keep sucking down
that tar, Vermin.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.491
John.
John.

24:23.528 --> 24:26.554
Really?
Jesus, John.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.664
John,
what's your decision?

24:34.105 --> 24:36.505
- What did he say, Dana?
- He said, and I quote,

24:36.541 --> 24:39.874
"This is why I hire women to blow me,
not run my studio."

24:39.911 --> 24:41.242
Meaning what?

24:41.279 --> 24:42.610
Meaning he's shutting
down the movie

24:42.647 --> 24:44.808
and I might have to blow
him to keep my job.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.318
I can't believe this.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.219
Vince, it's over budget,
overly complicated.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.348
- It's over.
- This is unbelievable.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.290
If it's any consolation,

24:54.326 --> 24:56.726
he thought you were great
in what he saw and so did I.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.854
Sorry, guys.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.191
Vin, I don't know
what to say.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.863
There's nothing to say.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.838
No one could have
seen this coming.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.675
So what now?

25:13.678 --> 25:16.112
Let's go home.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.382
Why are you
making fun of me?

25:28.426 --> 25:30.621
I just thought we were going
to spend the weekend in bed,

25:30.662 --> 25:32.425
and you want to pet Shamu.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.295
I am not trying
to avoid the sex, okay?

25:34.332 --> 25:37.563
I have been here for 12 years
and I have not been to Sea World.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.127
Fine, Sea World
from 10:00 to 1:00

25:40.171 --> 25:42.298
- then back to bed.
- Thank you.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.009
Oh, shit.
It's Vince.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.276
Shh, I'm not here.

25:50.315 --> 25:53.284
Yo, buddy, what's up?

25:55.787 --> 25:57.687
Oh, man.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.817
Yeah yeah.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.159
Of course I'll be there.

26:18.109 --> 26:20.168
We're gonna need to buckle up
before we take off, sir.

26:20.211 --> 26:22.145
Yeah, and we're gonna
need some Scotch

26:22.180 --> 26:24.444
after we take off.
And plenty of it, sister.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.280
Is that Vincent Chase
in 13B?

26:27.319 --> 26:30.220
In coach?
No.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.554
Excuse me.
Sorry, guys.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.083
Sorry I'm late, guys.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.761
- We've you been, Turtle?
- Nowhere.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.629
Just running some errands.
How you doing, Vin?

26:41.666 --> 26:44.897
Hey, we always said if we had
nothing we'd go back to Queens.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.699
Everything's gonna
be all right.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.228
It always is.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.177
Seriously, Turtle.

26:53.211 --> 26:55.202
What's the big mystery?
Where've you been?

26:55.246 --> 26:57.680
No mystery.
Just had some stuff to do.

26:57.716 --> 27:00.378
- What stuff?
- Don't worry about it.

27:00.418 --> 27:02.443
You okay?

27:02.487 --> 27:04.819
Been better.
