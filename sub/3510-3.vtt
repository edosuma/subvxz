00:28.629 --> 00:29.552
Yes!

00:29.836 --> 00:31.309
What are you so excited about?

00:31.310 --> 00:33.060
It's the latest
issue of "Skymall."

00:33.061 --> 00:34.531
Oh-- sweet.

00:34.532 --> 00:35.795
Oh, really, darling,

00:35.796 --> 00:37.076
who subscribes to "Skymall"?

00:37.077 --> 00:39.564
Isn't perusing all that
dreck on the plane enough?

00:39.565 --> 00:41.130
Dreck?
Mother, I will have you know,

00:41.131 --> 00:42.130
this is the gateway

00:42.131 --> 00:44.354
to the hottest new
inventions in the world.

00:44.355 --> 00:45.874
Where else can you
find a remote control

00:45.875 --> 00:48.175
that has a bottle... opener?

00:49.109 --> 00:49.981
What?

00:50.415 --> 00:52.060
I think it's Alexis'
decision letter

00:52.061 --> 00:53.485
from Stanford university.

00:54.062 --> 00:55.093
Oh, kiddo.

00:55.432 --> 00:56.382
You okay?

00:56.686 --> 00:58.604
Yeah, it just makes it so real.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.709
She grew up so fast.

01:00.773 --> 01:02.155
Well, what do you expect,

01:02.156 --> 01:03.460
her to live here forever?

01:03.461 --> 01:05.325
Well, her? Yes. You...

01:05.438 --> 01:06.180
Mm.

01:06.181 --> 01:07.853
Mm. Watch it.

01:08.009 --> 01:09.248
Is that the mail?

01:09.641 --> 01:10.376
Oh, yeah.

01:10.377 --> 01:12.480
You have one here from a Mr.
Stan Ford.

01:12.481 --> 01:14.064
Is that anyone you know?

01:22.314 --> 01:22.976
Well...

01:22.977 --> 01:24.060
Darling?

01:26.601 --> 01:27.943
I-I didn't get in.

01:27.944 --> 01:28.464
What?

01:28.465 --> 01:30.468
Oh, sweetie. I'm so sorry.

01:30.469 --> 01:32.209
But I picked all my classes.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.961
I bought t-shirts.

01:35.449 --> 01:36.785
I-I had it all planned.

01:39.185 --> 01:40.847
How could Stanford think
she's not worthy?

01:40.848 --> 01:41.847
She's perfect.

01:41.848 --> 01:43.411
Last week you didn't
want her to go.

01:43.412 --> 01:45.607
Yeah, but I didn't not
want her to get in.

01:45.608 --> 01:47.297
I was sure she would get in.

01:47.626 --> 01:48.633
You got in.

01:48.753 --> 01:49.985
Well, I wouldn't now.

01:50.537 --> 01:52.400
Anyway, put your
bruised ego aside.

01:52.401 --> 01:53.721
I'm sure she's crushed.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.768
Well, actually, right
now she's in denial.

01:55.769 --> 01:57.456
When I left, she was on the
phone with admissions,

01:57.457 --> 01:59.461
explaining to them,
they'd made a mistake.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.544
Where's the body?

02:04.553 --> 02:06.992
That is an excellent question.

02:07.264 --> 02:08.704
You mean there's no body?

02:08.953 --> 02:10.632
Nope. Just lots of blood.

02:10.633 --> 02:11.610
Whosever it is,

02:11.611 --> 02:13.233
there's no way they survived.

02:14.073 --> 02:15.217
Well, where'd they go?

02:15.465 --> 02:17.715
You're the one with all the
crazy theories, Castle.

02:17.716 --> 02:18.632
Walking dead.

02:18.633 --> 02:21.992
But there are indications
that the body was moved.

02:22.612 --> 02:24.033
I think I know who moved it.

02:24.249 --> 02:26.867
I got witnesses that said they
saw an unmarked white van

02:26.868 --> 02:28.825
fleeing the scene
just after 7:00 A.M.

02:28.969 --> 02:30.560
They get an eye on who
was behind the wheel?

02:30.561 --> 02:32.831
No, but we got unis
canvassing for eyewitnesses

02:32.832 --> 02:34.639
and checking every
street-level security camera

02:34.640 --> 02:35.794
in a 5-block radius.

02:35.795 --> 02:36.873
Tire tracks.

02:37.249 --> 02:38.832
Okay, get a cast
of the tire tread.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.737
CSU might be able
to get make and model.

02:43.794 --> 02:44.825
There's two different-size
footprints.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.162
There was at least two of 'em.

02:46.251 --> 02:48.114
Yeah, but there's no
tread on the footprints.

02:48.115 --> 02:49.670
Must have been wearing booties.

02:51.099 --> 02:52.274
Missing body,

02:52.275 --> 02:54.411
killers who literally
cover their tracks,

02:54.572 --> 02:55.266
anyone else getting

02:55.267 --> 02:57.114
a quick-strike
assassin squad vibe?

02:57.115 --> 02:58.449
Come on, Castle.
You're not saying

02:58.450 --> 02:59.738
this is some kind
of black-ops job?

02:59.739 --> 03:02.018
I'm not saying it.
The evidence is saying it.

03:02.019 --> 03:03.939
I'm betting this guy's
buried at sea by now.

03:04.515 --> 03:06.475
Lanie, there's an
imprint in the blood.

03:06.507 --> 03:08.372
Yeah, it looks like
a box or a case.

03:08.373 --> 03:09.622
Might have been our victim's.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.188
nuclear launch codes probably.

03:11.213 --> 03:12.796
Hey, Ryan, there's a pattern.

03:12.797 --> 03:15.253
Let's see if CSU can ID it.

03:16.261 --> 03:17.268
Is there a problem?

03:17.269 --> 03:18.596
Oh, no. Sorry.

03:18.597 --> 03:20.075
It's just that word, "pattern."

03:20.076 --> 03:22.092
Jenny and I, we're still
registering for the wedding.

03:22.093 --> 03:24.222
China, silverware, stemware--

03:24.223 --> 03:25.966
sheets, not to mention...

03:28.269 --> 03:29.902
CSU, imprint, got it.

03:29.997 --> 03:30.862
Yo.

03:31.149 --> 03:32.468
I'm pretty sure I got
a cause of death.

03:32.469 --> 03:34.054
You mean besides
massive blood loss?

03:34.055 --> 03:35.174
Gunshots.

03:35.175 --> 03:37.278
Neighbors heard a pair go
off at 6:40 this morning.

03:37.279 --> 03:38.878
40? Are you sure?

03:38.879 --> 03:40.271
Uh, positive. Why?

03:40.272 --> 03:41.854
Because Ryan's
witnesses saw a van

03:41.855 --> 03:43.487
racing outta here at 7:00.

03:43.727 --> 03:45.573
Who would kill someone,
wait for them to bleed out,

03:45.574 --> 03:46.773
and then take their body?

03:46.774 --> 03:49.485
I guess that rules out
quick-strike assassin squad.

03:50.741 --> 03:52.428
An imprint in the blood
is your best lead?

03:52.429 --> 03:54.380
Well, based on stitching,
CSU determined

03:54.381 --> 03:55.796
that the briefcase
is an Underwood,

03:55.797 --> 03:58.507
which is pricey, and only
two local shops sell them.

03:58.508 --> 04:00.170
They're giving us
customer information.

04:00.171 --> 04:01.738
Sounds like a long shot at best.

04:01.739 --> 04:03.378
We're waiting on
tire tread analysis,

04:03.379 --> 04:05.595
and detective Ryan is
overseeing the review

04:05.596 --> 04:08.706
of over 50 security cameras
looking for that van.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.009
What about the victim?
Any closer to an ID?

04:11.010 --> 04:11.586
Based on blood,

04:11.587 --> 04:13.938
Dr. Parish determined that
our victim is a male.

04:13.939 --> 04:15.570
So we're looking for
missing persons reports

04:15.571 --> 04:16.579
of men in that area.

04:16.579 --> 04:19.849
Men? You've narrowed the
victim pool down to men?

04:21.656 --> 04:23.280
Uh, well, in New York City,

04:23.281 --> 04:26.170
that actually eliminates over
four million women, so...

04:28.297 --> 04:30.823
Mr. Castle, I don't know
what the mayor sees in you,

04:30.824 --> 04:32.376
but I know how you're alike.

04:32.377 --> 04:33.713
He's term-limited.

04:36.897 --> 04:37.757
Maybe if I sent her flowers--

04:37.758 --> 04:39.677
No. No.

04:41.476 --> 04:43.964
So an investigation
without a body...

04:43.965 --> 04:45.516
that's kinda new, right?

04:45.641 --> 04:48.222
You know, there have been
murder investigations

04:48.223 --> 04:50.390
where authorities
haven't found the body.

04:50.687 --> 04:52.193
Yeah, but i-in those cases,

04:52.194 --> 04:54.094
they still know who
the victim is.

04:55.054 --> 04:57.334
Father of four disappears
on fishing trip,

04:57.335 --> 04:59.271
blood found in family garage.

05:00.023 --> 05:00.838
Where do you start

05:00.839 --> 05:02.351
when you don't know
who the victim is?

05:02.432 --> 05:03.407
You...

05:04.735 --> 05:05.638
uh...

05:05.639 --> 05:07.359
you--you--you know, you could...

05:09.488 --> 05:10.934
We really need to find
the body, don't we?

05:10.935 --> 05:12.294
Yeah. Pretty much.

05:12.295 --> 05:13.518
I may be able to help.

05:13.519 --> 05:15.217
Security cam footage
near the alley

05:15.218 --> 05:17.879
clocked three vans that matched
our witnesses' description,

05:17.880 --> 05:19.679
two Astros and an Econoline.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.896
It's the Econoline.

05:20.993 --> 05:23.112
- Tire tread analysis just came back.
- You get plates?

05:23.113 --> 05:26.390
Yeah, the Econoline is
registered to a PW storage.

05:26.391 --> 05:27.982
It's only six blocks
from our crime scene.

05:27.983 --> 05:29.217
All right. Let's go.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.448
Plates match.

05:47.847 --> 05:48.743
Beckett.

05:52.447 --> 05:53.374
Door.

06:07.346 --> 06:08.859
Ready?

06:16.312 --> 06:17.353
What the hell?

06:26.730 --> 06:27.859
What's in these things?

06:28.881 --> 06:29.824
I don't know.

06:31.973 --> 06:33.901
Judging from the size of 'em,

06:34.157 --> 06:35.490
you'd almost expect there'd be...

06:35.529 --> 06:36.942
- People!
- Jeez.

06:37.996 --> 06:38.827
They're people.

06:38.828 --> 06:39.772
They're people.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.110
They look frozen.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.245
What the hell is this place?

06:54.055 --> 06:59.070
Sync by YYeTs, corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

07:00.800 --> 07:01.919
Who are they all?

07:02.278 --> 07:03.772
Does anyone else
have the sudden urge

07:03.773 --> 07:06.140
to run through the streets,
screaming "they're here"?

07:06.141 --> 07:07.389
Yeah, this is detective Beckett.

07:07.390 --> 07:09.460
- I need every CSU tech--
- Movement.

07:09.461 --> 07:10.654
Movement, 10:00.

07:16.005 --> 07:17.644
NYPD! Show us your hands!

07:17.645 --> 07:19.044
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

07:19.045 --> 07:20.286
- Now!
- Now!

07:20.470 --> 07:21.461
Turn around.

07:22.758 --> 07:24.085
We're just doing our job.

07:24.086 --> 07:26.332
Killing and freezing
people is your job?

07:26.333 --> 07:29.061
No. He was already dead when
we arrived to pick him up.

07:29.062 --> 07:31.367
We work for Passageway,
a cryonics company.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.023
- Cryonics.
- Turn around.

07:33.024 --> 07:35.100
That explains the roomful
of human popsicles.

07:35.101 --> 07:36.437
They all have contracts with us.

07:36.438 --> 07:37.781
We cryopreserve them.

07:37.782 --> 07:39.229
To be brought back to life

07:39.230 --> 07:41.556
in a science-fiction future
where death has a cure.

07:41.557 --> 07:43.044
Think they can put me
under till the wedding?

07:43.045 --> 07:45.087
How did you know he was
dead before we did?

07:45.102 --> 07:46.253
He was wearing a bio-watch

07:46.254 --> 07:48.445
with a pulse monitor and GPS.

07:48.518 --> 07:51.108
We're notified immediately
when a client's pulse stops.

07:51.109 --> 07:52.884
We were there in 15 minutes.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.444
That explains the
timeline problem.

07:54.445 --> 07:57.140
Even if that's true,
what were you thinking,

07:57.141 --> 07:58.829
moving a shooting victim?

07:58.830 --> 08:00.116
Why didn't you call 9-1-1?

08:00.117 --> 08:01.117
We couldn't wait.

08:01.118 --> 08:02.812
In cryonics, every minute counts.

08:02.813 --> 08:04.701
We had to get him frozen
as quickly as possible

08:04.702 --> 08:06.150
t-to keep his brain alive.

08:06.151 --> 08:08.844
His brain isn't alive.
It's dead. He's dead.

08:08.845 --> 08:10.526
That's a matter of opinion.

08:11.101 --> 08:12.366
Dr. Ari Weiss,

08:12.397 --> 08:13.463
CEO of Passageway.

08:13.464 --> 08:15.383
This is my attorney,
Johnny Rosen.

08:15.456 --> 08:17.343
I imagine you have
many questions.

08:17.344 --> 08:19.198
Yeah, starting with
who's the murder victim

08:19.199 --> 08:21.079
you took from my crime scene?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.998
His name is Lester Hamilton--

08:22.999 --> 08:25.118
a biology professor
at Hudson university.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.703
- Can you call it in?
- I'm on it.

08:26.704 --> 08:27.387
He also happens to be

08:27.388 --> 08:29.748
an old friend from
Harvard medical school.

08:30.140 --> 08:32.019
It's ironic he died so young.

08:32.035 --> 08:32.836
Why is that?

08:32.837 --> 08:34.703
He conducted
cutting-edge research

08:34.703 --> 08:37.193
developing life-extension
techniques.

08:37.193 --> 08:38.895
Not that it did him any good.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.174
So he worked with you?

08:43.176 --> 08:44.104
No.

08:44.339 --> 08:47.159
Lester focused on how to
extend life before death.

08:47.553 --> 08:49.713
I created Passageway in
order to preserve the hope

08:49.714 --> 08:51.608
of future life, after death.

08:52.382 --> 08:54.285
You got any celebrities in here?

08:54.286 --> 08:55.622
Ted Williams?

08:55.671 --> 08:56.837
Jack Frost?

08:57.216 --> 08:58.733
We don't discuss our clients.

08:58.734 --> 09:00.805
Well, you're gonna have
to discuss this one.

09:00.927 --> 09:02.240
Lester Hamilton was murdered,

09:02.241 --> 09:04.507
and my ME will be taking
custody of his body

09:04.508 --> 09:06.062
as soon as she gets here.

09:07.318 --> 09:09.677
Detective, our client--
Professor Hamilton--

09:09.678 --> 09:11.597
has an iron-clad agreement
with Passageway

09:11.598 --> 09:14.108
to have his body cryopreserved
upon his death.

09:14.109 --> 09:16.181
Short of a court order,
he's not going anywhere.

09:16.182 --> 09:18.235
And any attempt to take
him would constitute

09:18.236 --> 09:19.436
tortious interference,

09:19.437 --> 09:22.327
and we would sue you and
the NYPD into oblivion.

09:27.302 --> 09:28.461
Okay. Got it.

09:29.229 --> 09:30.765
DA won't back us up on this one.

09:30.766 --> 09:32.405
They say that the
case law is murky.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.337
I'll say it's murky.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.228
A life-extension
researcher is killed,

09:35.229 --> 09:38.277
then a shadowy cryonics company
absconds with the body?

09:38.390 --> 09:40.202
This has all the
hallmarks of a vast

09:40.203 --> 09:41.985
and insidious conspiracy.

09:42.798 --> 09:45.305
I'm still trying to figure out
how to explain it to Gates.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.808
They steal our victim and
then threaten to sue us?

09:49.809 --> 09:52.105
Sir, it's a legal
chicken-and-egg problem.

09:52.106 --> 09:54.857
Since Hamilton's body
is on private property,

09:54.858 --> 09:56.320
we can't get it
without a warrant,

09:56.321 --> 09:58.120
but it's gonna be tough
to get a warrant,

09:58.121 --> 09:58.900
because without the body,

09:58.901 --> 10:00.273
we can't even prove
he was murdered.

10:00.769 --> 10:02.459
You get that doublespeak
from their counsel?

10:02.693 --> 10:04.804
No, sir. My mother was a lawyer.

10:04.805 --> 10:05.683
Anyway, trust me

10:05.684 --> 10:07.133
this is the argument
that they will make.

10:07.134 --> 10:08.539
Okay. Then where are we?

10:08.540 --> 10:10.427
Well, the cryonics
technician said that

10:10.428 --> 10:12.531
Hamilton was shot
twice in the chest.

10:12.532 --> 10:14.060
They turned over his clothes,

10:14.061 --> 10:15.971
and based on the
holes in the shirt,

10:15.972 --> 10:17.867
it--it looks like it was
a large-caliber bullet.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.205
There's still money
in his wallet,

10:19.206 --> 10:20.941
suggesting it wasn't
a random mugging.

10:20.942 --> 10:22.270
Well, what about the briefcase?

10:22.271 --> 10:25.102
Technician said that there
wasn't a briefcase at the scene.

10:25.103 --> 10:26.405
I called up Hamilton's wife.

10:26.406 --> 10:28.660
She was adamant that he left
the apartment this morning

10:28.661 --> 10:30.014
with a briefcase in hand.

10:30.015 --> 10:31.726
She's on her way in
right now with a--

10:31.727 --> 10:32.893
a Dr. Philip Boyd.

10:32.894 --> 10:34.782
He's a colleague of Mr.
Hamilton's.

10:36.615 --> 10:37.614
Yes.

10:37.766 --> 10:39.230
Hamilton's office at
Hudson university

10:39.231 --> 10:40.667
was broken in to three days ago

10:40.668 --> 10:41.899
and his computer was smashed.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.909
- Security never found out who did it.
- Check into it.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.771
See if you can find something
campus cops missed.

10:45.772 --> 10:46.610
Yeah.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.659
Sounds like something in
that office or briefcase

10:48.660 --> 10:49.722
was worth killing for.

10:49.723 --> 10:51.227
Then find out what, detective.

10:51.228 --> 10:52.955
And get the wife to
release his body.

10:52.956 --> 10:53.868
Yes, sir.

10:55.099 --> 10:56.428
I can't do it.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.492
I have to honor Lester's wishes.

10:58.493 --> 11:00.035
Mrs. Hamilton, you do understand

11:00.036 --> 11:01.547
that without your husband's body,

11:01.548 --> 11:03.603
we might not be able
to solve his murder?

11:03.604 --> 11:06.162
If preservation is discontinued,

11:06.163 --> 11:07.995
he's gonna be gone forever.

11:07.996 --> 11:10.682
With all due respect, he
already is gone forever.

11:10.683 --> 11:12.444
Lester would dispute that.

11:12.637 --> 11:15.427
He and I have been colleagues
at Hudson for 20 years now.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.500
And, uh, he's a true believer.

11:17.532 --> 11:19.787
For him, the keys
to life extension,

11:19.788 --> 11:22.654
to reversing death itself,
were within reach,

11:22.655 --> 11:25.810
so he would never give up
his chance at revival.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.716
Do you know why he chose to
focus on life extension?

11:29.716 --> 11:31.900
We fell madly in love
with each other.

11:32.468 --> 11:35.027
He told me that one lifetime
together wasn't enough.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.381
He wanted more.

11:37.588 --> 11:38.625
So do I.

11:42.316 --> 11:45.211
Mrs. Hamilton, we think that
whoever killed your husband

11:45.212 --> 11:47.052
might have stolen his briefcase.

11:47.053 --> 11:48.123
Do you know what was in it?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.717
His research for the
Ambrosia project.

11:50.718 --> 11:51.780
He always had it with him.

11:51.781 --> 11:52.775
Ambrosia as in

11:52.776 --> 11:55.517
the food Greek gods ate
to achieve immortality?

11:55.518 --> 11:58.272
And what was the Ambrosia
project exactly?

11:58.664 --> 12:00.711
Philip, how would you explain it?

12:00.712 --> 12:02.433
Well, it's a little
outside my wheelhouse,

12:02.434 --> 12:04.455
but Lester was developing

12:04.456 --> 12:06.911
pharmaceutical implants
that cause the body

12:06.912 --> 12:09.984
to produce young cells
instead of aging ones.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.323
He expected it to extend

12:12.324 --> 12:14.347
the human lifespan by ten years.

12:14.348 --> 12:16.843
A treatment like that would be
worth a fortune to big pharma.

12:16.844 --> 12:18.076
Billions.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.457
Though most of the money would
have gone to Beau Randolph.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.949
Beau Randolph?

12:22.074 --> 12:23.953
The guy behind "college
girls gone crazy"?

12:23.954 --> 12:25.258
Mm-hmm.

12:25.978 --> 12:27.074
How is...

12:27.522 --> 12:29.859
How is a porn mogul
connected to all this?

12:29.994 --> 12:33.017
Us researchers take our
funding where we can get it.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.985
Randolph made a killing in porn,

12:34.986 --> 12:38.049
and now he fancies himself
a venture capitalist.

12:38.050 --> 12:39.871
He is funding Lester's
research, you know?

12:39.872 --> 12:42.959
He was.
Lester cut all ties with him.

12:42.960 --> 12:43.983
And why is that?

12:43.984 --> 12:46.495
Lester wanted to take an
open-source approach--

12:46.496 --> 12:48.115
publish his research online,

12:48.116 --> 12:51.262
and then develop it with his
peers to speed up the process.

12:51.263 --> 12:53.761
And that way, no one could
hold a patent on the results.

12:53.762 --> 12:55.354
And how did Randolph
feel about that?

12:55.355 --> 12:57.463
Oh, they had awful
fights about it,

12:57.464 --> 12:59.120
but Lester was adamant.

12:59.577 --> 13:00.096
In fact,

13:00.097 --> 13:02.360
he was supposed to
upload the data today.

13:02.376 --> 13:03.399
When did your husband

13:03.400 --> 13:05.515
and Mr.
Randolph have their falling out?

13:05.560 --> 13:06.696
Three days ago.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.424
Three days ago--that's when
his office was broken in to.

13:10.048 --> 13:10.711
Wh--

13:10.712 --> 13:13.416
Beau Randolph is distasteful,
of course, but...

13:14.000 --> 13:14.871
Do you really think--

13:14.872 --> 13:17.231
I think that losing
billions of dollars

13:17.232 --> 13:18.777
is motive for murder.

13:21.288 --> 13:23.761
So not only is Beau
Randolph the proud owner

13:23.762 --> 13:25.629
of a Smith & Wesson .45
automatic...

13:25.630 --> 13:27.319
Which is a large enough caliber

13:27.320 --> 13:29.382
to have created that entry
wound in our victim.

13:29.383 --> 13:31.686
He also has a carry permit.

13:31.735 --> 13:33.708
Wh--I couldn't even
get a carry permit.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.765
- How did he get one?
- The hard way.

13:35.766 --> 13:37.525
Several guys saw their
girlfriends in his videos

13:37.526 --> 13:38.877
and beat the hell out of him.

13:38.878 --> 13:39.877
No longer jealous.

13:39.878 --> 13:41.933
The gun still doesn't
tie him to our murder.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.370
Yeah, but this might.

13:43.371 --> 13:45.254
A charge on our
vic's credit card.

13:45.255 --> 13:48.493
30 this morning, he bought
breakfast at Medusa diner.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.997
I talked to the waitress.
Guess who was with him.

13:49.998 --> 13:50.853
Beau Randolph.

13:50.854 --> 13:52.509
And there was a whole lot
of yelling going on.

13:52.510 --> 13:54.629
30, that's 10 minutes
before Hamilton was shot.

13:54.630 --> 13:55.807
Come on, Castle.

14:06.274 --> 14:07.666
The Ambrosia project--

14:07.667 --> 14:09.329
it sounds like a
Robert Ludlum novel

14:09.330 --> 14:10.963
where the millionaire playboy

14:10.964 --> 14:12.375
kills a researcher
to get his hands

14:12.376 --> 14:13.910
on the secret formula
for eternal life.

14:13.911 --> 14:16.242
Yeah, well, ten years
is not eternal life.

14:16.247 --> 14:17.670
Would you do it?
Would you get the implants?

14:17.671 --> 14:19.616
I don't think I need 'em. Huh?

14:19.904 --> 14:21.000
I mean the...

14:21.056 --> 14:22.190
pharmaceutical implants.

14:22.191 --> 14:24.238
So I could live to
100 instead of 90?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.422
No, I think I will pass.

14:25.423 --> 14:27.102
What if you could stay
the same way you are now

14:27.103 --> 14:28.198
for the next ten years?

14:28.199 --> 14:29.776
I don't want to stay the same.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.288
How could you not
want ten extra years?

14:32.289 --> 14:33.023
Well, one thing I've learned

14:33.024 --> 14:35.159
is that you never know
how much time you have.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.791
And if I thought I had more,

14:36.792 --> 14:38.655
I just might end up wasting it.

14:38.656 --> 14:40.847
Yeah, you're gonna need
to get those implants,

14:40.848 --> 14:42.400
otherwise, you'll get older

14:42.401 --> 14:44.711
and ten years from now, I'll
still be exactly the same.

14:44.712 --> 14:46.457
Isn't that how you'll be anyway?

14:47.097 --> 14:47.969
Detective Beckett.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.433
Mr. Randolph will be right out.

14:49.434 --> 14:50.281
Great. Thank you.

14:50.282 --> 14:52.949
Everyone here for "sorority
pillow fight #7,"

14:52.950 --> 14:53.920
come on back.

14:55.408 --> 14:56.599
Someone needs to get these girls

14:56.600 --> 14:58.680
clothes made of actual fabric.

14:58.681 --> 15:00.328
Whoa. When did you
become so judgmental

15:00.329 --> 15:02.054
about practically naked women?

15:02.055 --> 15:04.112
Since my daughter
hit college age.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.714
And there he is--

15:06.744 --> 15:08.376
defiler of coeds.

15:09.528 --> 15:10.512
Detective Beckett.

15:10.513 --> 15:11.656
Beau Randolph.

15:13.649 --> 15:15.063
Are you sure you're
not here to audition

15:15.064 --> 15:17.160
for my "post-docs
play doctor" series?

15:17.695 --> 15:18.623
No.

15:19.287 --> 15:20.303
Then what can I do for you?

15:20.304 --> 15:22.977
You can answer a few questions
about Lester Hamilton.

15:23.976 --> 15:25.320
Like why did you kill him?

15:28.006 --> 15:30.156
Yeah, I was with
professor Hamilton

15:30.157 --> 15:31.565
at the diner this morning.

15:31.613 --> 15:33.860
The only crime was how
bad the food was.

15:33.861 --> 15:35.765
Witnesses say that you fought.

15:36.005 --> 15:36.612
That's right.

15:36.613 --> 15:38.132
I'd sunk millions
into his research,

15:38.133 --> 15:39.844
and suddenly, he wants
to give it all away?

15:39.845 --> 15:41.799
If there's one thing
internet porn has taught me,

15:42.214 --> 15:44.086
you don't get rich
by giving it away.

15:44.087 --> 15:45.520
Is that why you killed him,

15:45.669 --> 15:46.870
so you could secure Ambrosia

15:46.871 --> 15:48.489
before he uploaded it
for everyone to see?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.199
That's why I walked home
and called my lawyer

15:50.200 --> 15:51.623
to issue an injunction.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.494
The doorman said you
came home at 7:10.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.199
Sounds right.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.489
Lester Hamilton was
killed at 6:40.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.894
That's plenty of time for
you to put two in his chest

15:58.895 --> 16:00.030
before walking home.

16:00.031 --> 16:02.806
I didn't kill him,
but I know who did.

16:02.807 --> 16:03.831
Do you really?

16:04.983 --> 16:06.032
Would you care to share?

16:06.033 --> 16:10.249
Look, last month, the NIH
rejected him for human testing.

16:10.342 --> 16:12.153
Now I told him the
setback was temporary.

16:12.545 --> 16:14.745
But he said he was too
close to a breakthrough.

16:14.746 --> 16:16.993
And he wasn't gonna let a bunch
of bureaucratic scientists

16:16.994 --> 16:18.249
get in his way.

16:19.018 --> 16:20.058
A week later,

16:20.698 --> 16:22.447
I notice $100,000 missing

16:22.448 --> 16:24.337
from the account I
set up for him.

16:24.761 --> 16:27.505
You think he went ahead with
human testing without approval.

16:27.545 --> 16:28.449
Yes...

16:29.033 --> 16:30.018
in secret.

16:30.154 --> 16:31.828
And then he tells
me to take a hike.

16:31.829 --> 16:33.636
I think he had that breakthrough.

16:33.637 --> 16:35.591
I think the Ambrosia
project worked.

16:35.592 --> 16:37.648
That's a very interesting theory, Mr.
Randolph.

16:37.649 --> 16:39.076
But you still haven't told us

16:39.077 --> 16:41.981
who you think killed Hamilton.

16:44.005 --> 16:46.061
If he was doing illegal testing,

16:46.933 --> 16:48.860
where were his test
subjects coming from?

16:49.101 --> 16:49.973
Hmm?

16:50.701 --> 16:51.957
I can tell you this,

16:52.029 --> 16:54.005
they weren't clean-cut
college kids.

16:55.021 --> 16:57.221
They're the kind of folks
who don't mind needles

16:57.234 --> 16:59.691
and are likely to
possess firearms.

17:00.819 --> 17:02.394
Here's my view, and unlike yours,

17:02.395 --> 17:04.179
mine is based on fact.

17:04.731 --> 17:08.387
You sunk millions of dollars
into Hamilton's research,

17:08.923 --> 17:10.594
and just as you thought

17:10.595 --> 17:11.859
that Hamilton...

17:12.029 --> 17:14.596
was making a breakthrough,
he cut you off.

17:14.843 --> 17:16.467
That is motive.

17:18.117 --> 17:19.722
You have a large-caliber gun.

17:19.723 --> 17:22.171
Hamilton just happened
to have been shot

17:22.172 --> 17:23.627
with a large-caliber gun.

17:23.627 --> 17:24.724
That is means.

17:24.726 --> 17:26.849
And you were seen
arguing with Hamilton

17:26.851 --> 17:28.995
ten minutes before he was killed.

17:28.996 --> 17:31.234
That is opportunity.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.035
It's conjecture, detective.

17:33.379 --> 17:34.498
You have no proof.

17:34.499 --> 17:35.819
Actually, I do.

17:36.059 --> 17:38.386
CSU just found that
your 45-caliber gun

17:38.387 --> 17:39.859
was fired this morning.

17:42.715 --> 17:43.763
Ouch.

17:44.236 --> 17:45.485
You know what we call that?

17:46.292 --> 17:47.405
The smoking gun.

17:51.413 --> 17:53.445
Well, that had nothing
to do with Hamilton.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.661
There was a flock of pigeons
on my roof this morning,

17:55.662 --> 17:56.710
squawking,

17:57.286 --> 17:58.558
and I was trying to sleep.

17:59.676 --> 18:00.668
Pigeons?

18:00.861 --> 18:02.341
That's what you're gonna go with?

18:09.037 --> 18:10.444
Given that the only
evidence you have

18:10.445 --> 18:12.358
is frozen inside Mr. Hamilton,

18:12.718 --> 18:13.629
yeah,

18:13.934 --> 18:15.311
that's what I'm going with.

18:16.253 --> 18:17.352
In the meantime,

18:18.541 --> 18:19.749
I'd like my lawyer.

18:21.757 --> 18:23.852
Smug, self-satisfied
son of a bitch.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.398
Yes, but with no witness
to the shooting,

18:25.399 --> 18:26.646
all we've got is a gun.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.750
Since we can't match ballistics
without the bullets,

18:28.751 --> 18:29.990
we can't even prove
it's the murder weapon.

18:29.991 --> 18:32.046
Thank you, Mr. Castle.
I know how ballistics works.

18:32.047 --> 18:33.239
Sir, we need that body,

18:33.240 --> 18:34.726
otherwise, we don't have a case.

18:34.727 --> 18:37.382
I'll call the DA.
I don't care if case law's murky.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.287
We have a suspect now.

18:39.606 --> 18:40.908
Here's the deal, boys--

18:40.909 --> 18:43.104
the DA's office believes
that we currently

18:43.105 --> 18:45.007
have sufficient grounds
to obtain a warrant

18:45.008 --> 18:46.862
and take custody of
Lester Hamilton's body

18:46.863 --> 18:49.260
as evidence in his
murder investigation.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.158
You know we'll fight you, right?

18:51.308 --> 18:52.701
Do you really want to risk

18:52.702 --> 18:54.636
that case law will be
established on the basis

18:54.637 --> 18:56.975
of these extraordinary
circumstances?

18:56.991 --> 18:59.958
Case law that will limit the
rights of all your clients.

18:59.990 --> 19:02.579
Now I'm hoping that we
can find another way,

19:02.580 --> 19:04.492
but I need that body.

19:04.493 --> 19:06.293
We can't surrender
our client's chance

19:06.294 --> 19:07.900
at a long, productive future life

19:07.901 --> 19:10.407
because it proves
inconvenient for the state.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.705
Then I'm sure you'll
be hearing from

19:11.706 --> 19:13.410
the district attorney's
office shortly.

19:13.411 --> 19:15.363
There may be another way.

19:16.331 --> 19:18.322
Our admittance X-rays show
that Hamilton's heart

19:18.323 --> 19:19.844
was damaged by the bullets.

19:19.845 --> 19:22.619
So maintaining the body
is no longer a priority.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.947
Cryonics is mostly about
preserving the brain.

19:25.388 --> 19:27.618
By the time the technology
exists to revive Hamilton,

19:27.619 --> 19:30.115
we'll surely be able to
regenerate our bodies.

19:30.723 --> 19:31.787
Bottom line--

19:32.643 --> 19:34.258
we can keep the
courts out of this,

19:34.259 --> 19:37.187
and you can have Hamilton's
body immediately

19:37.707 --> 19:40.808
if you agree to leave
his head in storage

19:40.809 --> 19:42.056
at Passageway.

19:46.513 --> 19:47.689
Then we have a deal.

19:48.982 --> 19:49.992
Now all we need to do

19:49.993 --> 19:52.321
is match ballistics
to Randolph's gun.

19:53.354 --> 19:54.488
They're not a match.

19:54.801 --> 19:56.834
What do you mean,
they're not a match?

19:56.835 --> 19:59.057
I mean, the bullets in
Lester Hamilton's chest

19:59.058 --> 20:00.863
were not fired by
Beau Randolph's gun.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.264
Are you sure?

20:02.298 --> 20:04.633
No, I just sit down here
all day and make stuff up.

20:04.668 --> 20:05.747
Of course I'm sure.

20:05.748 --> 20:06.268
Sorry.

20:06.464 --> 20:07.806
Here's the ballistics report.

20:08.054 --> 20:09.752
Randolph's gun is a .45.

20:09.753 --> 20:11.832
Headless here was shot with a .38.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.785
Getting that body was
supposed to sew our case up

20:15.786 --> 20:16.775
not blow it apart.

20:16.776 --> 20:18.668
How can those bullets not match?

20:18.669 --> 20:20.261
I have a theory, but
you're not gonna like it.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.731
You know, I'm open to
anything right now.

20:21.765 --> 20:22.932
Randolph is innocent.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.467
Yeah, you're right.
I don't like it.

20:24.502 --> 20:27.036
Randolph can't be the only one
who wanted Hamilton's research.

20:27.070 --> 20:28.927
Maybe a competing
life-extension researcher?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.539
Maybe.
I'm gonna call his wife up...

20:30.540 --> 20:31.672
and see what she knows.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.981
Alexis?

20:39.015 --> 20:40.415
Yeah, she's spinning out.

20:40.449 --> 20:43.886
She's never not gotten something
she set her sights on.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.052
Do you mind if I--

20:45.086 --> 20:46.253
No, no.
You should be with her now.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.989
- You're sure?
- Yeah, Castle.

20:48.023 --> 20:50.158
I think I can manage without
you for a few hours.

20:50.159 --> 20:51.418
Right.
Don't look so happy about it.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.544
Hey. Yo, Ryan. What's up, man?
Where you been?

20:55.664 --> 20:56.506
Down at the college,

20:56.507 --> 20:58.499
running down that break-in
in Hamilton's office.

20:58.534 --> 21:00.734
- So listen to this...
- Mm-hmm.

21:03.264 --> 21:04.437
What the hell is this?

21:04.471 --> 21:06.640
That, my friend, is
Beau Randolph's alibi.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.807
A dead pigeon?

21:07.842 --> 21:09.286
CSU found it on the
roof of his building

21:09.287 --> 21:10.846
with a slug in its
belly from his .45.

21:10.847 --> 21:11.970
Seriously?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.541
So Randolph really did
commit murder, huh?

21:13.542 --> 21:15.698
Yeah. Just writing him up for
animal celelty right now.

21:15.699 --> 21:17.945
Maybe there's still time to
cryonically freeze the little guy.

21:19.964 --> 21:20.958
Hamilton's office?

21:21.362 --> 21:21.910
Yeah.

21:21.935 --> 21:24.325
So first off, Hudson's
campus cops--

21:24.558 --> 21:26.532
wow-- I know what we'll be doing

21:26.533 --> 21:27.638
when we're fried and
don't care anymore.

21:27.766 --> 21:28.938
At least they bagged
the evidence.

21:29.193 --> 21:31.458
We were able to pull prints off
Hamilton's smashed computer.

21:31.489 --> 21:34.148
They match one of his
students-- an Eddie Peck.

21:34.274 --> 21:35.490
Straight A's, no record.

21:35.745 --> 21:38.441
Then what was he doing breaking in to
Hamilton's office, breaking his computer?

21:38.442 --> 21:40.131
Well, tell me if this
answers your question.

21:40.132 --> 21:44.195
His father is a lead researcher
at Smiht & Briar pharmaceuticals.

21:44.272 --> 21:45.147
Big pharma.

21:45.148 --> 21:47.726
Young Peck stole Hamilton's
research for his dad.

21:48.539 --> 21:49.893
That look familiar, Peck?

21:49.924 --> 21:52.119
It should. Had your prints
all over it.

21:52.129 --> 21:53.754
We know you broke in
to Hamilton's office.

21:53.755 --> 21:54.636
What were you looking for?

21:54.691 --> 21:56.940
It wasn't supposed to turn
out this way, I swear.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.123
I just--I didn't want
to be a disappointment.

21:58.158 --> 22:00.493
To who, your father?

22:00.527 --> 22:01.727
You did this for him, didn't you?

22:01.762 --> 22:03.463
You don't know what he's like.

22:03.497 --> 22:05.698
- What did you do with the research?
- What research?

22:05.732 --> 22:08.300
Professor Hamilton's,
the Ambrosia project.

22:08.335 --> 22:09.836
It was inside his briefcase,

22:09.870 --> 22:11.871
and that's why you
killed him, isn't it?

22:11.905 --> 22:13.372
Killed him? No, no.

22:13.406 --> 22:15.807
I asked him to change my grade.

22:15.842 --> 22:17.209
Excuse me?

22:17.243 --> 22:19.311
I met this girl--Suzy--at the
beginning of the semester.

22:19.346 --> 22:21.546
I'd never been in love before,
but I fell hard, man.

22:21.581 --> 22:22.814
When I wasn't with her,

22:22.849 --> 22:24.283
all I could do was daydream
about her, you know?

22:24.317 --> 22:25.684
What the hell are
you talking about?

22:25.718 --> 22:27.386
What does your love life
have to do with any of this?

22:27.420 --> 22:28.886
'Cause of Suzy, I
didn't study for

22:28.920 --> 22:30.488
professor Hamilton's midterm.
I got an "F."

22:30.522 --> 22:31.922
We don't get F's in my family,

22:31.957 --> 22:33.891
especially in bio?
My father would kill me.

22:33.925 --> 22:35.226
So I broke in to
Hamilton's office

22:35.260 --> 22:37.228
and tried to change the
grade in his computer,

22:37.262 --> 22:38.496
but I didn't know his password.

22:38.530 --> 22:40.118
I got frustrated and threw
it against the wall.

22:40.119 --> 22:41.222
Don't you lie to me, Peck.

22:41.525 --> 22:44.201
Hamilton's grade report said
you got an "A" on his midterm.

22:44.235 --> 22:45.702
That's 'cause after
class the next day,

22:45.736 --> 22:47.070
I followed him, tried
to work up the courage

22:47.105 --> 22:48.605
to beg him to change my grade.

22:48.639 --> 22:50.407
But before I could, we were
in this scary neighborhood,

22:50.441 --> 22:51.941
and he went into
this seedy hotel.

22:51.976 --> 22:53.110
And what was he doing there?

22:53.144 --> 22:54.211
I don't know.

22:54.245 --> 22:55.645
But he came out,
like, an hour later,

22:55.679 --> 22:57.114
and when he saw me,
he totally wigged.

22:57.148 --> 22:59.182
Like eyes-popping-out-
of-his-head crazy.

22:59.217 --> 23:01.083
He--he offered to
change my "F" to an "A"

23:01.118 --> 23:04.353
in exchange for me never
telling anyone he was there.

23:04.839 --> 23:06.188
This hotel have a name?

23:06.223 --> 23:08.024
The 130th Street Inn.

23:08.058 --> 23:11.027
That little beady-eyed guy
in 24, a big-time scientist?

23:11.061 --> 23:12.495
Get out.

23:12.529 --> 23:14.163
How long had he been coming here?

23:14.197 --> 23:16.531
Ah, booked his room solid
for the last month.

23:16.565 --> 23:17.765
Paid cash.

23:17.799 --> 23:19.267
What was he doing
here for a month?

23:19.301 --> 23:22.404
Sweet pea, this is a "don't
ask, don't tell" hotel.

23:22.438 --> 23:24.572
So you didn't ask,
but could you tell?

23:24.606 --> 23:26.374
Little dude made a big deal

23:26.409 --> 23:28.776
about no one ever going into
his room for any reason,

23:28.810 --> 23:30.245
not even to clean.

23:30.733 --> 23:34.981
Ah, I figured he had a blow-up
doll collection or something.

23:41.156 --> 23:43.290
Whoa.

23:43.324 --> 23:45.625
This some boy-in-the-plastic-bubble
thing or what?

23:45.660 --> 23:47.961
I'll tell you something, I
am not cleaning this up.

23:47.995 --> 23:49.462
Please stay back, ma'am.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.897
Twist my arm.

23:56.741 --> 23:58.137
Dude, there better not
be body parts in there.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.505
Just...

24:01.841 --> 24:04.076
Scalpels...

24:04.110 --> 24:05.277
Drill.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.413
Is that a laser?

24:08.448 --> 24:11.183
Lidocaine. That's an anesthetic.

24:11.912 --> 24:12.843
Syringes?

24:14.005 --> 24:15.273
It's an operating room, bro.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.788
Who the hell was Hamilton
operating on, and why here?

24:18.966 --> 24:20.433
His Ambrosia project.

24:20.467 --> 24:22.267
He said he was on the verge
of a major breakthrough

24:22.302 --> 24:24.269
but got turned down
for human testing.

24:24.304 --> 24:26.439
Looks like Beau
Randolph was right.

24:26.473 --> 24:29.174
Hamilton decided not to wait.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.798
Who would sign up for an
illegal experimentation

24:36.799 --> 24:38.950
of an untested
surgical procedure?

24:38.951 --> 24:41.019
Oh, I don't know.
If it'd make you feel better, live longer,

24:41.053 --> 24:43.054
hell, I'd give it a try.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.723
Though not in a sleazy hotel.
I need five stars.

24:47.092 --> 24:48.793
Any sign of Alexis this morning?

24:48.827 --> 24:50.795
Oh. No.

24:50.829 --> 24:54.198
When I got home last night, she
was sacked out on the couch.

24:54.232 --> 24:56.200
I had to carry her up to bed.
That's the first time in years.

24:56.234 --> 24:57.293
Poor baby.

24:57.294 --> 24:59.669
She hasn't been herself since
getting that rejection.

25:01.806 --> 25:04.107
Hey, sweetheart.
What's in the box?

25:04.141 --> 25:06.410
My life of lies.

25:06.444 --> 25:08.077
I'm throwing it all out.

25:08.112 --> 25:10.447
Oh, honey, all your awards?
You worked hard for these.

25:10.481 --> 25:12.048
Did I?

25:12.082 --> 25:14.083
Half of them are
participation trophies.

25:14.118 --> 25:15.484
Super-pee-wee soccer.

25:15.519 --> 25:18.721
You remember the time...

25:18.755 --> 25:20.991
you scored a goal off your head,
and you didn't even realize it?

25:21.444 --> 25:22.725
And I got a trophy for that?

25:22.759 --> 25:24.493
We didn't even win a single game.

25:24.528 --> 25:25.642
Oh, come on.
You weren't supposed to keep score.

25:25.643 --> 25:27.182
Yeah? Well, Stanford keeps score.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.988
Some of these awards are
for actual achievements--

25:31.034 --> 25:33.334
Franklin middle school
spelling bee champ,

25:33.368 --> 25:35.570
Marlowe prep French award.

25:35.604 --> 25:38.807
The one I wanted was Stanford.

25:40.509 --> 25:42.777
Sweetheart, I-I know Ashley
is going to Stanford--

25:42.812 --> 25:44.479
This has nothing
to do with Ashley!

25:44.513 --> 25:46.781
It's me, dad! I'm a failure!

25:46.816 --> 25:49.082
Hey, just because you
didn't get into one school

25:49.116 --> 25:51.752
does not make you a failure.

25:51.786 --> 25:54.020
But you are gonna have to accept

25:54.055 --> 25:56.089
that you didn't get
in and move on.

25:58.993 --> 26:00.761
How?

26:02.797 --> 26:04.864
I just wanted to give her
the childhood I never had.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.198
Maybe I overprotected her.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.900
You gave her a great
childhood, Castle.

26:07.935 --> 26:09.301
It's not a bad thing.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.303
Not if she's incapable
of handling rejection.

26:11.338 --> 26:13.305
Look, we all get our
hearts broken eventually.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.608
Just give her some time.
She'll find her way.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.678
As long as she doesn't end up
auditioning for Beau Randolph.

26:18.712 --> 26:21.045
So any word on what was going on

26:21.080 --> 26:22.481
in Hamilton's hotel of horrors?

26:22.515 --> 26:24.683
Lanie's running test results
on the bloody instruments,

26:24.717 --> 26:27.051
but so far, it looks like
at least one test subject

26:27.086 --> 26:29.153
wasn't pleased with the results.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.856
CSU found that note in the hotel.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.024
"You told me this would work.
I trusted you."

26:33.058 --> 26:34.459
Looks like Beau
Randolph was right.

26:34.494 --> 26:36.026
Hamilton was doing human testing.

26:36.060 --> 26:37.695
Looks like it didn't
go as planned.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.162
Maybe Frankenstein's monster

26:39.197 --> 26:41.398
came back and killed
Frankenstein.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.201
No luck ID'ing the note's author.

26:44.235 --> 26:45.970
The only prints CSU found in
the room were Hamilton's.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.505
What about Hamilton's wife?

26:47.539 --> 26:48.906
We checked with her,
his colleagues,

26:48.940 --> 26:50.240
and his students.

26:50.274 --> 26:51.741
No one even knew he was
doing any secret research.

26:51.775 --> 26:54.477
Well, someone knew about it.
Canvass around the hotel.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.479
There's a big homeless
population in the area.

26:56.514 --> 26:58.481
Maybe that's where he got
his subjects.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.249
You know, I don't get Hamilton

27:00.283 --> 27:02.519
on a character level.

27:02.553 --> 27:04.020
Why would he risk

27:04.054 --> 27:06.423
his reputation, his safety,
to do illegal testing...

27:06.424 --> 27:07.186
in some flophouse?

27:07.187 --> 27:09.167
I mean, he was ready to
give away his research,

27:09.168 --> 27:11.026
so it wasn't the money.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.995
Why was he in such a big rush?

27:13.507 --> 27:15.564
Lanie's got the DNA results.

27:15.598 --> 27:18.500
So the labs tell us who
Hamilton's test subjects were?

27:18.535 --> 27:20.268
Preliminary DNA results

27:20.302 --> 27:22.237
from the needles and the
drill show the DNA

27:22.271 --> 27:23.900
is all from the same person--

27:24.191 --> 27:25.647
Lester Hamilton.

27:27.275 --> 27:30.545
So Lester wasn't doing the
procedures on someone else.

27:30.579 --> 27:32.196
- Someone was doing them to him.
- Well--

27:32.197 --> 27:34.549
And he decided to put his
money where his mouth was,

27:34.583 --> 27:35.965
using himself as a test subject.

27:35.966 --> 27:37.518
But then who was doing
the procedures on him?

27:37.553 --> 27:39.020
And how did it even
get him killed?

27:39.054 --> 27:39.622
Can I just--

27:39.623 --> 27:41.208
Maybe the treatment
was a success.

27:41.209 --> 27:42.927
Hamilton realized
he was on the cusp

27:42.928 --> 27:45.258
- of a revolutionary life-extension breakthrough--
- Oh, my gosh--

27:45.292 --> 27:45.908
Could you be--

27:46.379 --> 27:48.414
Guys!

27:48.448 --> 27:49.378
Hold up.

27:49.379 --> 27:52.617
Stop doing that thing
you do for one second.

27:53.310 --> 27:54.184
Thank you.

27:54.302 --> 27:57.463
Now all of the theorizing
is cute as usual.

27:57.497 --> 27:58.798
But we've got a problem.

27:58.833 --> 27:59.505
How so?

27:59.693 --> 28:02.938
The Ambrosia project implant is
supposed to be in the patient's arm.

28:03.136 --> 28:04.604
I checked his arms, in fact,

28:04.638 --> 28:06.506
I checked every inch
of Hamilton's body.

28:06.540 --> 28:09.608
There were no intrusions
or wounds anywhere.

28:09.946 --> 28:11.877
I don't understand.
I thought you said the needles had his DNA.

28:11.911 --> 28:13.345
They do.

28:13.379 --> 28:16.147
And his brain matter, too.

28:16.182 --> 28:18.283
So whatever they were doing,
they were doing to his head?

28:18.317 --> 28:19.785
Which is the only part
of Hamilton's body

28:19.819 --> 28:21.620
that you haven't checked yet.

28:21.654 --> 28:22.465
Get me his head,

28:22.466 --> 28:25.256
and I can tell you what
this is all about.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.359
We had an agreement.

28:28.393 --> 28:30.628
That was before, when Mr.
Hamilton's head

28:30.662 --> 28:32.663
wasn't relevant to this case.

28:32.698 --> 28:34.465
- Now it is.
- Please.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.967
Dr. Weiss, I have a warrant,

28:36.001 --> 28:37.439
and you're welcome to read it.

28:37.487 --> 28:39.459
I know it's legal, but think
of Lester Hamilton's wishes.

28:39.460 --> 28:40.371
His wishes right now

28:40.405 --> 28:42.072
come second to this
murder investigation.

28:42.107 --> 28:43.807
Now open the door.

28:45.643 --> 28:48.311
I'll be as minimally invasive
as possible, Dr. Weiss.

28:48.345 --> 28:50.413
Any invasion at all
will destroy memory,

28:50.447 --> 28:53.316
personality, vital functions.

28:56.453 --> 28:57.587
Oh, my God.

28:57.622 --> 28:58.822
What is it?

28:58.856 --> 29:00.723
It's gone.

29:00.757 --> 29:03.592
The thermal storage unit
should be right there.

29:03.866 --> 29:05.160
You gotta be kidding me.

29:05.194 --> 29:07.545
Are you saying, you
lost his head?

29:13.735 --> 29:14.668
I don't understand.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.583
How does my husband's
head just go missing?

29:17.584 --> 29:19.485
That's what we're trying to
figure out, Mrs. Hamilton.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.055
Do you have any idea who
could have operated on him

29:22.089 --> 29:23.356
at the 130th Street Inn?

29:23.390 --> 29:25.157
I already told detective Beckett,

29:25.191 --> 29:26.959
I don't know anything about that.

29:26.993 --> 29:29.061
Now I need to find
him immediately.

29:29.095 --> 29:32.364
I need to make sure that his
wishes are being respected.

29:32.398 --> 29:34.733
I understand, and I promise you

29:34.768 --> 29:35.918
that we are doing everything
that we possibly can--

29:35.919 --> 29:38.037
What about Dr. Weiss?
He's in charge over there.

29:38.071 --> 29:39.371
Have you spoken to him?

29:39.405 --> 29:40.905
Detective Beckett is
with him right now.

29:40.939 --> 29:42.618
I'm just as concerned
about Hamilton's head

29:42.619 --> 29:43.703
as you are, detective.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.148
There must have been a break-in
at our storage facility.

29:46.149 --> 29:48.618
A break-in? Really?
Is that what you're going with?

29:48.653 --> 29:51.321
We've never had anything like this
happen to one of our clients.

29:51.355 --> 29:52.522
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

29:52.556 --> 29:55.324
No, I will tell you what
makes sense, Dr. Weiss.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.526
Either you're part of a cover-up,

29:57.560 --> 29:59.161
or you're a murderer,

29:59.195 --> 30:00.296
or both.

30:00.694 --> 30:02.282
What? W-why would I kill anyone?

30:02.283 --> 30:03.106
I have a family.

30:03.107 --> 30:04.698
Well, then did you take
them into consideration

30:04.699 --> 30:07.346
when you colluded
in moving a body

30:07.347 --> 30:08.848
from a murder scene.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.160
That was a one-in-a-million
circumstance,

30:11.161 --> 30:13.103
and everyone ended up
getting what they needed.

30:13.104 --> 30:15.437
Then why is it, at every
step of this investigation,

30:15.438 --> 30:17.393
you have gotten in my way?

30:17.394 --> 30:19.654
Hamilton ends up dead
and in your custody.

30:19.655 --> 30:21.863
The DA's about to turn
over the body to me,

30:21.864 --> 30:24.068
and you negotiate
to keep the head.

30:24.069 --> 30:25.528
I get a warrant for the head,

30:25.529 --> 30:27.584
and suddenly, it ends up missing.

30:28.698 --> 30:30.444
The only thing I'm guilty
of is trying to protect

30:30.445 --> 30:32.984
Lester Hamilton's desire
to be cryopreserved.

30:32.985 --> 30:34.741
I don't know anything
about his murder.

30:34.742 --> 30:36.052
Please check with my company.

30:36.053 --> 30:38.023
There must have been a break-in.

30:49.677 --> 30:50.369
What's up?

30:50.370 --> 30:51.409
Turns out there was a break-in

30:51.410 --> 30:52.644
at the Passageway
storage facility

30:52.645 --> 30:53.432
in the middle of the night.

30:53.433 --> 30:55.203
No way. And they took the head?

30:55.204 --> 30:57.626
Security video. Just watch.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.632
Last night, 3:32 A.M.

31:01.089 --> 31:02.348
Hamilton's storage container?

31:02.349 --> 31:03.316
Yep.

31:08.151 --> 31:09.071
Who the hell's that?

31:09.072 --> 31:11.499
Hamilton's dear
friend and colleague.

31:14.951 --> 31:16.400
Dr. Boyd.

31:19.185 --> 31:21.380
NYPD. Open up, Boyd.

31:23.504 --> 31:25.109
I don't think he's opening up.

31:29.377 --> 31:31.768
- He went out the window to the fire escape.
- Yeah, you think?

31:31.777 --> 31:33.072
Just excited.

31:40.335 --> 31:42.164
He's got the head.
Beckett, he's got the head.

31:42.165 --> 31:43.586
I can see that!

31:43.841 --> 31:45.842
Dr. Boyd, stop!

31:49.603 --> 31:51.337
Oh! Oh, oh, no!

31:51.467 --> 31:52.774
Oh!

31:55.593 --> 31:57.202
Talk about taking a header.

32:08.144 --> 32:09.256
Ow!

32:09.848 --> 32:11.997
Oh! Ow!

32:12.435 --> 32:13.781
I'll get the head.

32:17.890 --> 32:18.858
Get up.

32:19.448 --> 32:22.293
I got it! I got Hamilton's head.

32:22.413 --> 32:23.661
I think it's okay.

32:23.695 --> 32:24.768
You are under arrest

32:24.769 --> 32:26.684
for the murder of
Lester Hamilton.

32:26.685 --> 32:27.470
I didn't kill him.

32:27.471 --> 32:29.218
I was trying to save his life.

32:37.390 --> 32:38.710
He's gonna be fine.

32:39.285 --> 32:40.552
That's a relief.

32:42.681 --> 32:44.700
Why would anyone steal a head?

32:51.887 --> 32:54.148
So, Dr. Boyd, it seems we
caught you red-handed.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.727
I didn't kill him.

32:56.939 --> 32:58.733
Well, then why did
you steal his head?

32:59.075 --> 33:00.216
Did you miss him?

33:01.421 --> 33:03.899
We know about your operating
room at 130th street,

33:03.900 --> 33:06.130
and you were doing surgery
on Hamilton's head,

33:06.131 --> 33:10.021
but it had nothing to
do with life extension.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.268
So either you tell me about it,

33:12.278 --> 33:15.476
or we take the head back and
we find out on our own.

33:21.963 --> 33:23.438
He came to me a month ago,

33:23.439 --> 33:25.890
complaining about
severe headaches.

33:25.952 --> 33:27.015
An MRI showed

33:27.016 --> 33:29.377
that he had stage
IV glioblastoma.

33:29.378 --> 33:30.563
A brain tumor?

33:30.715 --> 33:32.941
Inoperable, untreatable--

33:32.942 --> 33:34.457
he only had a few months to live.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.666
Well, then why did he go to you?

33:35.667 --> 33:36.854
Why didn't he go to a hospital?

33:36.855 --> 33:38.284
Because as a scientist,

33:38.285 --> 33:40.103
he knew the limits of
current therapies,

33:40.104 --> 33:42.088
and he was familiar
with my work--

33:42.089 --> 33:43.905
nanoparticle genetic therapy.

33:43.906 --> 33:45.107
English.

33:45.629 --> 33:48.068
Targeted treatment of tumors.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.701
I'm years away from
human testing, but...

33:52.791 --> 33:54.720
he was my best friend.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.636
How could I say no to him?

33:58.927 --> 34:01.431
So you set up shop at the
hotel to keep it secret.

34:01.432 --> 34:03.435
If anyone found out,

34:03.436 --> 34:05.467
I'd lose my tenure,

34:05.508 --> 34:07.703
my funding, reputation.

34:07.704 --> 34:11.694
We couldn't even risk using
existing operating suites.

34:12.806 --> 34:15.777
Lester swore he wouldn't
even tell Cynthia.

34:15.777 --> 34:17.743
And then he got the money
from Beau Randall's fund

34:17.744 --> 34:19.273
in order to get you
your supplies.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.295
Yeah.

34:20.295 --> 34:21.449
I did...

34:21.449 --> 34:23.853
Five procedures over the month.

34:23.855 --> 34:25.245
And was he getting better?

34:25.425 --> 34:26.551
No.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.603
A few days before he was killed,

34:28.603 --> 34:32.168
I did an MRI that
showed that the tumor was...

34:32.357 --> 34:33.730
still growing.

34:36.482 --> 34:38.380
The treatment had failed.

34:40.702 --> 34:42.047
A brain tumor?
That's why Hamilton wanted

34:42.049 --> 34:43.728
to put his project online--

34:43.728 --> 34:45.304
in hopes that someone would
finish his research.

34:45.306 --> 34:47.496
Yeah, I've got Esposito
running down Boyd's alibi

34:47.496 --> 34:48.663
just in case.

34:50.135 --> 34:51.379
Alexis?

34:54.176 --> 34:55.431
What's wrong?

34:55.696 --> 34:57.036
Everything.

34:58.626 --> 35:00.208
How do you do it, dad?

35:00.209 --> 35:01.374
Do what?

35:01.561 --> 35:02.580
Well, that letter that you have

35:02.581 --> 35:04.180
framed in your office.

35:04.607 --> 35:06.683
- My first manuscript rejection.
- Yeah.

35:06.684 --> 35:08.495
How can you stand
having it there?

35:08.496 --> 35:09.968
Because it drives me.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.627
And I got 20 more of
those before black pawn

35:12.628 --> 35:14.996
ever agreed to publish
"in a hail of bullets."

35:15.095 --> 35:16.377
That letter...

35:17.498 --> 35:20.001
That letter reminds me
of what I've overcome.

35:20.656 --> 35:22.391
Rejection isn't failure.

35:22.722 --> 35:24.248
It sure feels like failure.

35:24.249 --> 35:25.948
No, failure is giving up.

35:26.372 --> 35:27.156
Everybody gets rejected.

35:27.157 --> 35:30.132
It's how you handle it that
determines where you'll end up.

35:32.153 --> 35:34.522
My whole life has been
about making sure

35:34.734 --> 35:36.498
I could get into any
college I wanted.

35:37.587 --> 35:39.134
What's it about now?

35:39.991 --> 35:41.454
Give it time.

35:41.975 --> 35:43.418
You'll figure it out.

35:51.489 --> 35:52.705
Whew.

35:53.404 --> 35:54.566
She okay?

35:55.068 --> 35:56.644
Were any of us at that age?

35:57.813 --> 35:59.671
Nah, it'll suck until it doesn't.

35:59.672 --> 36:01.076
Yeah, well, speaking of sucking,

36:01.077 --> 36:02.828
Boyd alibied out.

36:03.107 --> 36:04.392
He was at a department breakfast

36:04.393 --> 36:06.797
the morning that
Hamilton was killed.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.272
I mean, we caught the guy
with our victim's head.

36:09.273 --> 36:11.136
99 times out of 100,

36:11.137 --> 36:13.070
you catch someone
with a guy's head,

36:13.500 --> 36:14.263
he killed the guy.

36:14.264 --> 36:15.880
Yeah. Well, Boyd also provided

36:15.881 --> 36:18.155
the MRIs of Hamilton's head.

36:18.505 --> 36:19.858
Lanie confirmed that the tumor

36:19.859 --> 36:22.852
would've ravaged his brain
in a couple of months.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.833
So in an odd way, he got lucky.

36:26.426 --> 36:27.188
How so?

36:27.189 --> 36:28.383
Well, Dr.
Weiss said that cryonics

36:28.384 --> 36:30.445
was all about
preserving the brain.

36:30.446 --> 36:33.114
If Hamilton had lived, his
brain would've been destroyed.

36:33.115 --> 36:35.586
Cryonic preservation wouldn't
have been an option.

36:35.696 --> 36:37.936
So then our killer inadvertently

36:37.937 --> 36:39.803
saved him for the future.

36:40.586 --> 36:41.464
Unless...

36:41.465 --> 36:43.536
"One lifetime together
wasn't enough."

36:43.537 --> 36:45.163
That's our motive.

36:45.164 --> 36:47.625
Maybe it wasn't so inadvertent.

36:53.091 --> 36:54.608
Thank you for coming in, Mrs.
Hamilton.

36:54.609 --> 36:56.839
I understand that
you've already spoken

36:56.840 --> 36:58.192
with Dr. Boyd.

36:58.482 --> 36:59.459
Yes.

36:59.716 --> 37:01.173
It's a lot to process.

37:01.174 --> 37:02.079
Yeah.

37:03.142 --> 37:04.438
How can I help you?

37:04.503 --> 37:06.613
Well, we were hoping
that you could shed

37:06.961 --> 37:08.658
some light on some evidence

37:08.659 --> 37:10.284
that just came in.

37:10.467 --> 37:11.586
What's that?

37:11.587 --> 37:14.436
Your husband's computer, the
one his student smashed?

37:14.437 --> 37:15.252
The tech people here

37:15.253 --> 37:18.083
managed to recover a list
of recent downloads.

37:18.084 --> 37:18.982
Included on that list

37:18.983 --> 37:21.885
was Passageway's contract
termination form.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.843
Any idea why your husband
would download that?

37:25.963 --> 37:27.099
No.

37:27.447 --> 37:28.983
Well, it must be a mistake.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.190
Actually, the tech assured us

37:30.191 --> 37:32.653
that the download list was clean.

37:32.654 --> 37:35.168
Are you sure he didn't say
anything to you about that?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.410
Because the best I
can come up with

37:36.411 --> 37:38.107
is that your husband decided that

37:38.108 --> 37:40.550
working on his research
until his brain gave out

37:40.551 --> 37:42.184
was more important to him

37:42.739 --> 37:45.229
than cryonically
preserving himself.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.810
But you disagreed with him,
didn't you, Mrs. Hamilton?

37:49.561 --> 37:50.699
How could I disagree with him

37:50.700 --> 37:52.957
when I didn't even
know about the tumor?

37:52.958 --> 37:53.963
I think you did know,

37:53.964 --> 37:56.009
and that's why you killed him.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.674
So he would be preserved
for the future

37:57.675 --> 37:59.548
before his brain was ravaged.

37:59.549 --> 38:03.173
After shooting him, you
took his briefcase.

38:03.779 --> 38:05.970
This is insane.

38:07.424 --> 38:09.288
It's just wild conjecture.

38:09.289 --> 38:10.734
Actually, it's not.

38:10.735 --> 38:13.511
You got rid of the
gun, of course.

38:13.574 --> 38:15.437
But we found your
husband's briefcase

38:15.438 --> 38:17.109
hidden in your
building's basement.

38:17.110 --> 38:19.966
There were traces of your
husband's blood on it.

38:39.129 --> 38:41.684
I gave him that briefcase...

38:43.045 --> 38:44.906
When we got engaged.

38:48.524 --> 38:51.380
I couldn't just leave it behind.

38:52.996 --> 38:54.858
I had known for weeks

38:55.082 --> 38:56.250
that there was something wrong,

38:56.251 --> 38:59.349
but Lester said it
was just stress.

38:59.350 --> 39:01.714
And then a couple of nights ago,

39:02.628 --> 39:05.756
he passed out when he was
getting ready for bed.

39:08.757 --> 39:10.760
Then he told me the truth.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.450
But...

39:14.918 --> 39:17.358
he wasn't in his right mind.

39:18.841 --> 39:21.758
He was too concerned
about his research.

39:23.229 --> 39:25.499
I needed to protect

39:25.519 --> 39:27.302
our future.

39:31.230 --> 39:33.705
Our eternity together.

39:36.435 --> 39:39.304
It's what we always dreamed of.

39:41.557 --> 39:43.238
So, detective, would
you consider this

39:43.239 --> 39:44.973
to be a crime of passion?

39:44.974 --> 39:47.892
I would consider this
a crime of love.

39:48.133 --> 39:49.372
Nice.

39:49.437 --> 39:50.083
Though that would depend

39:50.084 --> 39:53.827
on whether Cynthia Hamilton
was in love or insane.

39:53.828 --> 39:56.705
Well, sometimes there's a
fine line between the two.

39:58.644 --> 39:59.487
Oh, Dr. Weiss.

39:59.488 --> 40:01.749
I have your release
forms ready to go.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.134
I'm grateful, detective. Castle.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.974
So I'll just need you to sign
down there at the bottom,

40:05.975 --> 40:07.316
and the charges against you

40:07.317 --> 40:08.923
and your employees at Passageway

40:08.924 --> 40:10.828
will officially be dropped
by the department.

40:10.829 --> 40:13.007
I'm happy to put this behind us.

40:13.837 --> 40:15.063
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

40:15.331 --> 40:18.215
It's a bio-watch signal.
A client has just flatlined.

40:19.617 --> 40:21.830
Well, that's strange. What is it?

40:21.831 --> 40:22.763
The signal--

40:22.764 --> 40:24.867
it's coming from
inside this building.

40:47.981 --> 40:49.818
The ring on her right hand.

40:55.946 --> 40:57.335
Cyanide pill.

41:05.193 --> 41:06.664
Detective Beckett,

41:07.564 --> 41:08.761
permission to have my technicians

41:08.791 --> 41:10.378
come and get her?

41:14.724 --> 41:16.207
Yes, of course.

41:22.174 --> 41:23.792
Wouldn't it be something
if they reunited

41:23.808 --> 41:26.269
a hundred, even a
thousand years from now?

41:26.606 --> 41:28.344
Well, anything's possible.

41:29.891 --> 41:31.324
You really believe that?

41:31.325 --> 41:33.986
That's what the great love
stories are about, right,

41:34.759 --> 41:36.343
beating the odds?

41:37.279 --> 41:38.798
I hope they make it.

41:40.584 --> 41:41.836
Me, too.
