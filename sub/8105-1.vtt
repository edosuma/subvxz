WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.671
Deep-fried shrimp.
And lobster.

00:05.881 --> 00:09.342
I never had lobster.
What, do they boil them
or grill them?

00:09.968 --> 00:13.179
Which one's better?
Just get them both.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.056
And I know I need
a strawberry malt.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.768
And then there's those
chocolate donuts,
they come in a box.

00:18.894 --> 00:23.481
We'll do our best to
accommodate. Tomorrow you'll
be moved to a holding cell.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.234
That's where
you'll get your last meal.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.698
You also have a constitutional
right to a spiritual advisor
of your choice.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.741
No, I don't need none of that.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.535
One last thing to think about.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.578
After I read
the execution warrant,

00:37.705 --> 00:39.831
you'll be given an opportunity
to make a statement.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.792
You might wanna take some time
and think about
what you wanna say

00:42.918 --> 00:44.669
as your final words.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.050
Yo, Clarence!
You hear that?

00:51.677 --> 00:54.095
A spiritual advisor
of my choice.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.723
Don't matter,
you're going to hell anyway.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.767
- You think I'll get another stay?
- You should.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.936
Supreme Court said it ain't
right to kill retards.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.730
Cut the chatter!

01:03.856 --> 01:05.231
Exercise time.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.960
Be back in an hour. Enjoy.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.904
Huh? What?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.781
Why did you hit me
so many times, Clarence?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.657
You know why!

01:56.784 --> 01:59.118
- You could have stopped.
- You stabbed me in the back, man.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.912
- Look, I never...
- You couldn't fight fair?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.622
Like you did?

02:03.624 --> 02:04.957
I had a wife and three kids.

02:05.083 --> 02:08.795
You were a sick bastard!
Open the door! Open the door!

02:08.921 --> 02:10.254
Clarence!

02:10.380 --> 02:11.923
What'd I ever do to you, man?

02:12.049 --> 02:13.966
You better stay
in this place.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.594
I was just minding
my own business.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.837
You can't go in there.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.924
Who are you?
And why are you wearing a tie?

03:37.050 --> 03:40.553
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
Can I tell her what it's regarding?

03:40.679 --> 03:44.557
Yes. I would like to know
why she gets a secretary and I don't.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.603
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.564
I didn't know
they had a secretarial school.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.525
Well,
I hope you took some classes
in sexual harassment law.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.654
Does the word "ka-ching"
mean anything to you?
I'm going in now.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.282
Dr. House, we are
in the middle of a meeting.

04:01.408 --> 04:05.244
What's with hiring
a male secretary?
J-Date not working out?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.038
He is cute, be careful.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.332
She's not like you,
she can't just walk into a bar

04:09.458 --> 04:10.833
and pick up her soul mate
in 20 minutes.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.502
I met Mark at a fundraiser
that happened to be held at a...

04:13.629 --> 04:14.629
You met me at a strip club.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.715
You were the worst $2
I've ever spent.
We'll catch up later.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.176
Stacy, it's House.
I know you can handle it.

04:20.302 --> 04:23.888
Nothing to handle.
He obviously wants to talk to you alone.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.684
If you have a problem
working with Stacy,

04:28.810 --> 04:30.186
you should have said so.

04:30.312 --> 04:34.148
What was I supposed to do?
Ask her to leave? That's just rude.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.568
Death row guy.
I want the case.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.070
How do you even
know about him?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.988
You don't have access
to the hospital's mainframe.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.240
No, but Party-Pants does.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.535
You stole my password?

04:46.662 --> 04:49.538
Hardly counts as stealing,
it's a pretty obvious choice.

04:49.665 --> 04:53.668
Well, I have already assigned
"death row guy" to Dr. Nolo.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.711
Nolo? Well, I...

04:55.837 --> 04:58.172
I don't wanna say anything bad
about another doctor,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.299
especially a useless drunk.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.884
You are addicted
to pain pills.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.595
Yeah, but I'm not useless.
Tell Nolo I'm taking over.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.098
Dr. Nolo is a
board-certified cardiologist.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.059
Well, good. I'm sure he'll explore
all the usual options

05:10.185 --> 05:15.022
for why a guy's heart starts beating so
fast it pumps out air instead of blood.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.942
Wait a second.
There are no usual options.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.988
How badly do you want this?

05:23.281 --> 05:26.409
I will give you two more
clinic hours this week.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.663
Don't bend over for the soap.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.876
Just the heart, or the patient have
any other complaints?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.212
Patient's not talking
to anybody.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.547
Where are we going?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.549
You are going
to the clinic for two hours.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.883
Me? Why?

05:43.719 --> 05:44.844
Talk to Cuddy.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.347
She's got me going
to Mercer State Prison,
Capital Sentences Unit.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.182
Aren't there better ways
to spend our time?

05:50.308 --> 05:53.519
Good question.
What makes a person deserving?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.062
Is a man
who cheats on his wife

05:55.188 --> 05:57.982
more deserving than a man
who kills his wife?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.151
Yeah, actually, he is.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.652
What about a child molester?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.405
Certainly not a good guy,
but he didn't kill anybody.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.575
Maybe he can get
antibiotics, but no MRIs.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.576
What about you?

06:08.702 --> 06:12.455
What medical care
should you be denied
for being a car thief?

06:12.581 --> 06:14.707
Tell you what.
Three of you work on a list

06:14.833 --> 06:18.210
of what medical treatments
a person loses based on
the crime they committed.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.671
I'll review it
when I get back.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.177
Your patient shanked one inmate
his first month here.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.555
Broke another one's neck.
Nearly decapitated one of my guards.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.891
Relax. I got
a great bedside manner.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.560
Too dangerous to house him
in the infirmary.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.063
You don't have to worry,
we've taken every precaution.

06:37.189 --> 06:41.567
I've had my men clear
from the cell all pens,
paper clips, and staplers.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.653
Any supplies that might
be used as a weapon.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.574
Open her up!

06:55.707 --> 06:59.168
For your visit,
we've got him cuffed
and shackled.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.670
And yet you're
staying out there.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.676
You're gonna have
to give me that. Wouldn't
want anybody to get hurt.

07:10.847 --> 07:11.847
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.557
I'm Dr. Cameron.
How you feeling?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.392
Little cough, no big deal.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.478
Okay,
then what you doing here?

07:17.604 --> 07:20.439
I just got a job
at the university,
they need a health clearance.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.567
Apparently,
I'm a little anemic, so they
made me get some more tests.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.236
Any family history of anemia?

07:25.362 --> 07:28.614
Not that I know of.
My mom died of cancer
when I was a kid.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.742
My dad's heart gave out
a couple of years ago.

07:32.661 --> 07:33.661
Brothers and sisters?

07:33.787 --> 07:37.039
I'm afraid it's a short
family history. That's it.

07:37.165 --> 07:41.168
I had a husband once,
but it didn't stick.

07:41.878 --> 07:46.090
My tests should be back,
probably in that file.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.675
- Probably.
- Yeah.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.681
Is everything okay?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.351
- Did you redo the x-ray?
- Twice.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.689
Well,
you don't need a consult.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.235
You know the diagnosis.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.196
All she has is a cough.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.707
Bluish tinge
to the fingernails. Lips.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.251
- He's hypoxic.
- What's that mean?

08:22.377 --> 08:24.170
It means he's not
getting enough oxygen.

08:24.296 --> 08:27.590
You know how people say
you can't live without love?

08:27.716 --> 08:30.217
Well,
oxygen's even more important.

08:33.430 --> 08:37.183
He's got fluid in his lungs.
Breathing rate of 50.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.018
He needs to be intubated,
put on a respirator.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.561
Don't have a respirator.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.564
Better get one
in about an hour,
or you're gonna lose him.

08:43.690 --> 08:47.276
I'll make out a requisition.
State's already sentenced
this man to die.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.571
I think the state was
a tad more specific about how.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.697
This is Dr. Gregory House.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.699
I need an ambulance pick-up
at Mercer State Prison.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.161
Wasted call, my men will
stop them at the gate.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.580
No way a death row inmate
leaves my prison.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.416
At least,
not through the front doors.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.717
- You work fast.
- So do you.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.761
- Was that a shot?
- Yeah.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.598
It was easy,
once I convinced the clerk
to take it to Judge Markham.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.558
She's a sucker for
Eighth Amendment arguments.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.268
Stop, I'm getting turned on.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.603
House!

09:23.313 --> 09:25.022
It was just a consult!

09:25.148 --> 09:27.566
You expect us to shut down
an entire floor for this guy?

09:27.692 --> 09:28.776
Did you do
something to your hair?

09:28.902 --> 09:29.902
Stacy!

09:30.028 --> 09:31.237
You said
you cleared it with her!

09:31.363 --> 09:32.571
Come on,
you've known me how long?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.365
And you still can't tell
when I'm joshing you?

09:34.491 --> 09:36.617
- Take him back to prison. Now.
- No, can't.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.579
See, ironically,
I'm bound by this court order
that your ace attorney got.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.874
I have to make him all better
before shipping him back
for the state to kill him.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.001
Is it just me,
or is that weird?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.962
Anyway, we're walking.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.390
Somebody left this
on my chair.

09:59.516 --> 10:03.519
It's clever, 'cause it forces
me to either deal with the
file or never sit down again.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.354
Cindy Kramer.
I told her you'd see her.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.855
Well, you shouldn't
have told her that.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.775
She's got metastatic squamous
cell lung cancer.
Six months tops.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.194
Have you even looked
at the x-ray?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.696
No. Just guessing.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.365
It's a new game. If I'm wrong,
she wins a stuffed bear.

10:16.491 --> 10:20.119
A spot on an x-ray
doesn't necessarily mean
that she's terminal.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.329
I love children.
So filled with hope.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.498
It could be pneumonia.
It could be sarcoidosis.

10:24.624 --> 10:29.378
Could be. If she didn't
already have swollen hilar
lymph nodes on the other lung.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.506
Can we at least
brainstorm for other ideas?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.057
Thank you.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.395
I still think
pneumonia and sarcoidosis.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.189
But, we should check
for tuberculosis

10:49.316 --> 10:52.484
and definitely rule out
congestive heart failure.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.488
Five stages of dying.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.866
Exactly.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.368
Personally, I think
it's all just New Age crap,

11:01.494 --> 11:03.829
but from your tear-filled,
puppy dog eyes,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.372
I think I've made my point.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.043
Now go tell Cindy
whatever-her-name-is
that she's dying.

11:10.170 --> 11:14.173
Tachycardia. Pulmonary edema.
Likely suspects?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.383
The death row guy?

11:16.509 --> 11:19.219
That's who you're working on
instead of Cindy?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.430
God, I've got to learn
not to beat around the bush.

11:21.556 --> 11:24.808
By "dying", I meant
no matter what we do.

11:24.934 --> 11:29.355
Very, very soon
she is going to be dead.
Is that still too subtle?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.565
I took an oath
to "do no harm".

11:31.691 --> 11:33.776
Yeah, but it's not like
they make you
sign it or anything.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.320
We cure your patient,
he goes back to death row.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.072
He goes back to death row,
they kill him.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.823
He stays here and we don't
treat him, he dies.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.700
And I still don't treat
"Cindy Lou Who".

11:41.826 --> 11:43.369
Can we get on with this?

11:43.495 --> 11:45.871
Yeah, I knew I could count
on your help for your homie.

11:45.997 --> 11:49.041
Exactly. I'm black.
I sympathize with guys
who grew up in the inner city,

11:49.167 --> 11:50.542
kept down by The Man.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.586
- Makes sense to me.
- It's a bunch of crap!

11:52.712 --> 11:55.881
You can't blame society
for the fact that you chose
to become a killer.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.383
The guy's probably
a heroin addict.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.344
That explains the tachycardia,
which caused the
pulmonary edema.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.972
How does an inmate
on death row
get his hands on heroin?

12:04.766 --> 12:07.393
- Are you serious?
- Man knows prisons.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.812
When we got
a yachting question,
we'll come to you.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.565
Okay, drugs it is.
Test his hair,
blood, urine, works.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.076
Thanks for getting my back.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.370
I thought
you seminary boys were
against the death penalty.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.788
I've left the seminary.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.873
Over their stance
on capital punishment?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.792
I'm against the death penalty
in principle.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.628
In practice, however,
watching a murderer die
causes me

12:34.754 --> 12:36.630
a lot less grief
than annoying my boss.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.508
We gotta check you out
before you go in.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.679
Department of Justice
statistics show

12:43.805 --> 12:45.764
that it's a racially motivated
form of punishment.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.351
Black defendants are 10 times
more likely to get
a death sentence than whites.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.395
Doesn't mean
we need to get rid
of the death penalty.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.398
Just means we need
to kill more white people.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.402
It's okay.
You're in a hospital,
we're taking care of you.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.697
Stay calm, you hear me?
Push two milligrams Ativan!

13:11.791 --> 13:14.710
Water. Water.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.846
What's the differential
for being thirsty?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.850
He was just
a little dehydrated.
And out of his mind.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.685
We upped his saline drip.
He's fine now.

13:31.811 --> 13:35.481
Blood and urine tests
came back clean, no sign
of opiates in his system.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.107
Don't do that.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.735
What?
You have some House theory
explaining heroin use

13:39.861 --> 13:41.945
- despite a negative test?
- Nope.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.407
Only I get to write
on the board.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.827
So it's not drugs.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.829
What else can cause a heart
to do wind sprints?

13:50.955 --> 13:55.167
You got the blood work back,
anything out of the ordinary?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.920
His bi-carb is low.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.130
Yeah, but which column?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.799
It could be the result
of the tachycardia,
or it could be the cause.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.801
- It's the cause.
- Why, because you want it to be?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.845
Let's see how well that works
with your other patient.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.138
We're just talking
semantics here.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.766
We should put him
on a bi-carb drip
and send him back.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.811
Right. Buff his numbers,
don't bother trying to figure
out the underlying cause.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.772
I thought you cared
about patients.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.316
Our job isn't
to make sure he can bounce
his grandkids on his lap.

14:19.442 --> 14:22.569
Our job is to get him
healthy enough to go back
to death row.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.239
Our job is to diagnose him.

14:30.954 --> 14:31.954
What?

14:32.622 --> 14:35.832
Mommy and Daddy are having
a little fight, doesn't mean
we've stopped loving you.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.584
Now, go outside and play.

14:37.710 --> 14:41.004
Get Daddy some smokes,
and an arterial
blood gas test.

14:55.311 --> 14:59.523
That was impressive. Okay,
what number am I thinking of?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.108
Are you trying
to get me fired?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.069
If you didn't want me
working here,
why didn't you just say so?

15:04.195 --> 15:06.822
I just don't want you
working right here,
in my office.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.824
- Anywhere else in the building is fine.
- Oh.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.825
It's a really big hospital.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.703
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk.
There's gonna be some overlap.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.454
God, I hope
that was a euphemism.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.789
Cuddy just reamed me!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.374
I hope that one means
what I think it means.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.584
For trusting you.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.794
She figured when she hired me
she'd at least have someone

15:20.920 --> 15:21.837
you couldn't walk all over.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.214
The number was six,
by the way.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.010
I need to know,
can I trust you?

15:30.054 --> 15:34.600
If I hadn't lied to you
about Cuddy's approval,
my patient would be dead.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.935
Great.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.022
Now I know.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.149
Now we can work together.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.363
I'll be drawing some blood
from your femoral artery.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.158
- From my what?
- Runs through your groin.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.078
You think
you're gonna stick me
in the jewels with that?

15:55.204 --> 15:58.832
It's really closer
to your thigh. Technically
at this point, it seems like

15:58.958 --> 16:00.959
your jewels are more
for display purposes anyway.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.712
Hold up, hold up.
Gimme some painkillers
or something.

16:03.838 --> 16:07.966
- A tough guy like you don't need them.
- Forget that, numb me up, man.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.977
You got some gang ink?
Let me see that.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.939
It's a Native American symbol.
It means "the force of life".

16:24.025 --> 16:26.818
That's what you tell
all these white dudes
so they let you play doctor.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.945
Yup, got them all fooled.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.283
For real, how a brother
like you go from gang banging
to wearing that white coat?

16:33.409 --> 16:37.954
How's a brother like you
go from loving a woman
to punching her skull in?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.125
Bitch stepped out.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.635
Sorry about that.
Guess I didn't use
enough lidocaine.

16:52.970 --> 16:57.391
Blood gas came back
with a pH of 7.28,
and decreased HCO-3.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.309
Which means two things.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.813
Most importantly,
Cameron was wrong
about the bi-carb.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.941
And less significantly,
we have a new symptom.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.653
Anion gap acidosis.

17:10.947 --> 17:15.117
Who's chubby? Come on,
pretend he loves puppies.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.828
Pretend he's a human being.
What do you got?

17:17.954 --> 17:20.414
I think we should
reconsider drugs.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.333
- He already tested negative.
- That's why I said reconsider.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.836
Back in juvie, I cut up
oregano and sold it as pot.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.671
Is that how you put yourself
through med school?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.424
What if Clarence thought
he was taking heroin,
but it was something else?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.844
What "something else"
could lead
to anion gap acidosis?

17:33.970 --> 17:35.387
Mudpiles.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.640
Well, you don't have to ask,
just wash your hands
before you come back.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.642
Methanol, uremia, diabetes...

17:40.768 --> 17:43.562
Oh, it's a mnemonic.
That makes sense, too.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.565
- Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acid...
- Rewind.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.984
- INH?
- Yahtzee.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.277
Drugs for tuberculosis.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.363
Nearly a quarter
of the prison population
is infected with TB.

17:53.489 --> 17:57.617
Clever entrepreneur like
Foreman here chops up his
meds, passes it off as heroin.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.162
INH poisoning would explain
all the symptoms.

18:00.288 --> 18:04.624
Who wants to head over
to the prison and find
Clarence's secret stash?

18:07.336 --> 18:10.297
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Great! Chase it is.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.052
I assume you have a reason
beyond wanting to make me
completely miserable.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.679
You got a prettier mouth.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.599
Better chance the inmates
will open up to you.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.059
Perhaps
I'll come out
looking just as monstrous.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.771
I mean,
isn't that what I deserve?

18:25.897 --> 18:28.273
Dr. VIVIAN: John,
it wasn't your fault.

18:28.399 --> 18:32.944
If your father hadn't
slipped you those drugs,
you would have never done...

18:36.866 --> 18:38.950
The man's in a coma!

18:39.076 --> 18:41.369
He didn't mind. I asked.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.455
You're getting crumbs
all over him.

18:43.581 --> 18:47.167
Why do you think they put TVs
in coma patients' rooms,
anyway?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.294
Some people think
they can still hear.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.088
Well, so leave them a radio.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.882
His eyes are closed.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.051
Who thinks they can see?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.597
Do you know why people
are nice to other people?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.474
Oh, I know this one!

19:02.600 --> 19:05.435
Because people are good,
decent and caring.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.355
Either that,
or people are cowards.

19:08.481 --> 19:12.859
If I'm mean to you,
you'll be mean to me.
Mutually-assured destruction.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.737
Exactly.
Are you gonna eat these chips?

19:16.531 --> 19:18.949
Are you gonna
get to your point?

19:21.786 --> 19:22.953
You need people to like you.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.747
I don't care
if people like me.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.876
Yes, but you need
people to like you
because you need people.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.672
Unless you think you can get
the next court order yourself.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.634
If Stacy can't trust you,
you can't use her.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.559
And, that's not even
dealing with the greater
agenda of getting her

19:45.685 --> 19:48.478
to dump her husband
and fall in love with you
all over again.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.564
Dr. BRUCE: We were gonna be
with each other forever!

19:50.690 --> 19:53.400
Look, I know
you're friends with her,
but there is a code.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.485
"Bros before hoes, man."

19:59.699 --> 20:01.283
- Crap.
- What is it?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.036
Death row guy is dying.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.583
Bradycardia. His heart rate's
dropped to 30.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.834
It's not gonna hold out
much longer.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.837
You just waiting to call
time of death, or are you
gonna give him atropine?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.839
- Temporary fix.
- Right.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.508
Don't know why those diabetics
are all hung up on insulin.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.926
They're just gonna
have to take more.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.012
Atropine's only gonna
buy you a few hours.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.638
We don't even know
what's wrong with him.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.515
Just get out of here.

20:36.819 --> 20:37.861
This is Chase.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.946
Did you beat any confessions
out of anybody?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.656
I haven't spoken
to any inmates.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.867
Does anybody
do their jobs anymore?

20:43.993 --> 20:46.953
I decided Clarence's life
isn't worth risking mine for.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.747
Appreciate your candor.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.333
Did you even go to the prison,
or are you just out
playing polo?

20:51.459 --> 20:53.209
I'm searching
both of Clarence's cells.

20:53.336 --> 20:56.004
I figured
if he's on something,
it's stashed somewhere.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.839
Unless he finished it.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.508
Yeah, that'd be a shame.
He could have
shoved it anywhere.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.845
There's envelopes
stacked to the ceiling,
bottles of copier toner,

21:03.971 --> 21:07.974
boxes of rubber bands,
paper, file folders.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.351
Call it off.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.977
Come on back.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.041
What's going on?

21:34.585 --> 21:36.002
You're dying.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.260
A man
deserves a last drink.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.974
You're okay.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.977
Thanks. That means a lot.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.860
All the tests
have been inconclusive?

22:00.987 --> 22:03.989
Diagnostics is more
of an art than a science.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.992
Should I be worried right now?

22:09.829 --> 22:12.080
I work for one of the top
diagnosticians in the country.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.792
We're pouring
all of our energy
into figuring this out.

22:17.211 --> 22:20.213
I thought you convicts
knew how to drink.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.966
You're at least
three shots behind.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.348
Now you're four shots behind.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.728
You better
get me the next one,
or I'm gonna kill you.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.362
House.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.866
I was just waiting
for test results, I was...

22:47.992 --> 22:50.994
Little busy right now.
Getting my drink on.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.830
Unbelievable.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.377
That's the finest piece
I've seen in 10 years.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.047
I could've hit that.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.840
And you didn't?

23:05.426 --> 23:08.344
Man, you're the one
that should be locked up.

23:10.014 --> 23:13.808
Tell me something.
I've been trying
to figure this out.

23:13.934 --> 23:18.063
Why does a guy
who's on death row

23:18.189 --> 23:20.356
suddenly try to off himself?

23:25.362 --> 23:27.864
I know you
drank that copier fluid.

23:27.990 --> 23:32.452
It's not as visually dramatic
as slitting your wrists
with a homemade shiv,

23:32.578 --> 23:34.454
but it will do the trick.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.379
It just hit me
all of a sudden.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.883
It was like,
they tell me when to eat,
when to sleep,

23:47.009 --> 23:49.677
when to walk,
when to talk, everything.

23:51.055 --> 23:54.015
I had to take
control of something, right?

23:55.017 --> 23:56.351
When to die.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.064
I figured that was
as good as anything.

24:05.486 --> 24:08.988
And that thought
just came to you,
just like that?

24:11.200 --> 24:14.452
Man, I told you,
for 23 hours...

24:15.996 --> 24:18.081
Look, here's the good news.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.377
The copier fluid you drank

24:22.503 --> 24:26.881
contains about 90% methanol,
which is very poisonous,

24:27.007 --> 24:30.301
and you took more than enough
to kill yourself.

24:30.427 --> 24:34.889
The bad news is,
the alcohol you just drank

24:35.015 --> 24:38.685
contains so much ethanol that
it's going to bind with that

24:38.811 --> 24:42.397
nasty formic acid
rampaging through your body,

24:42.523 --> 24:45.024
hence you're just
gonna pee it out.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.985
Harmlessly.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.782
Man, you are drunk.

24:52.908 --> 24:57.162
Yes, I am.
I also saved your life.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.878
At least for now.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.434
Morning! Your head hurts?

25:19.560 --> 25:22.187
No, you just have
a very grating voice.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.771
You always were a lightweight.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.481
Why are you talking to me?

25:25.608 --> 25:28.568
Can't it be enough that
I wanna cause you pain?

25:28.694 --> 25:31.529
The patient's okay now,
you're gonna send him back?

25:31.655 --> 25:32.906
Absolutely.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.169
- Can I trust you?
- You used to.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.009
I still think
the patient's sick.
I'm keeping him here.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.929
Yeah. Either you can
do your job and keep
the hospital informed,

25:56.055 --> 25:58.514
or you can help me make sure
the hospital is not informed

25:58.641 --> 26:00.475
and buy me some time.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.148
- Have you done a CT?
- Yeah, I have.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.316
With contrast?

26:08.442 --> 26:13.071
She's done everything
she needs to do except tell
her patient that she's dying.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.492
I told you,
only I get to play
with the markers.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.537
Our prisoner
has a new symptom.

26:21.664 --> 26:25.208
I'm not telling Cindy
she's dying until the
diagnosis is confirmed.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.210
I'm not buying that Clarence

26:27.336 --> 26:30.546
was trying to take control
of his life by suicide.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.799
Healthy people
don't kill themselves.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.550
Healthy people
don't kill other people.

26:34.677 --> 26:38.179
Guy just filed an appeal
in a state that hasn't
actually killed anybody

26:38.305 --> 26:39.889
in about 30 years.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.892
What if it wasn't suicide?
What if it was an escape plan?

26:43.018 --> 26:46.604
Drink enough methanol to get
transferred to a hospital,
try to escape from here.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.730
Excellent.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.150
Explains everything
except the symptom
that got him here.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.570
His heart went nuts
before he got stuck
in that storage cell

26:54.697 --> 26:56.572
and chugged a toner martini.

26:56.699 --> 26:59.117
I think there's something
going on in his head.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.662
Check for intracranial
lesions, brain infections,
autoimmune diseases,

27:02.788 --> 27:06.666
do a CT, LP, full workup.
State's paying, so go nuts.

27:10.671 --> 27:12.380
Where'd you
get these scars?

27:12.506 --> 27:16.676
I got shivved
my first month in. After I
healed up, I got mines.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.388
You guys still think I'm sick?

27:20.514 --> 27:21.681
Obviously.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.268
Why do you care?
Why don't you just let me die?

27:25.394 --> 27:26.561
Well, I'm different than you.

27:26.687 --> 27:29.439
Right. You love me
like your own mama.

27:29.565 --> 27:33.401
That's why the nurse says
you kicked her out when
my heart nearly stopped.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.194
Take a deep breath.

27:39.033 --> 27:41.326
Any family history
of mental illness?

27:41.452 --> 27:43.745
I always heard
my pop was crazy,
I never met the man.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.039
With my mom,
it was the drugs.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.832
Any siblings?

27:47.958 --> 27:51.627
I got a brother, pretty much
raised him on my own.

27:51.754 --> 27:55.673
- Inspirational. He doing time, too?
- Hey...

27:57.301 --> 28:00.678
He's a good kid.
Don't go judging
what you don't know.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.390
How's his health?

28:06.143 --> 28:09.145
I haven't heard from him
since I went inside.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.360
Spent 16 years with him,
changed his damn diapers.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.821
Can you imagine
your whole life

28:18.947 --> 28:21.824
being all about
the worst thing you ever did?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.583
You killed four people.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.544
And somehow
making mac and cheese
just the way he wants

28:33.670 --> 28:35.797
kind of loses
its significance.

28:43.347 --> 28:47.141
Oh, no. Now you've left
your entire body in my chair.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.559
What does that mean you want?

28:48.685 --> 28:51.396
I need a segmental
bronchoalveolar lavage.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.564
I take it the CT
with contrast came back?

28:53.690 --> 28:56.692
- They're not definitive.
- Biopsy would be.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.570
Biopsy would be
invasive and unnecessary.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.696
And definitive.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.533
But you don't want definitive,
you want to hang onto
your delusions

29:03.659 --> 29:04.575
as long as you can.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.577
A lavage could prove
it's not cancer.

29:06.703 --> 29:10.623
But you need me
to approve the procedure.
Must be a bitch.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.708
- The answer is no.
- Why?

29:13.836 --> 29:15.628
Because it's me?

29:16.296 --> 29:19.215
I'm over you!
I've jumped on the bandwagon.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.592
And I hate you, okay?

29:21.718 --> 29:23.553
Great. Let's treat her.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.431
What is it?

29:27.349 --> 29:30.601
You won't help Cindy,
but you're obsessed
with this piece of dirt!

29:30.727 --> 29:33.229
Are you just trying to prove
that who someone
is doesn't matter,

29:33.355 --> 29:36.232
or that all that matters
is your stupid puzzle?

29:41.238 --> 29:42.363
Fine.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.701
Treat them the same,
that's all I'm asking.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.787
One test.

29:51.540 --> 29:52.790
Wow.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.667
That is remarkable.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.588
According to those patchouli
oil-selling New Agers,

29:58.714 --> 30:00.590
it's supposed to be
the terminal patient,

30:00.716 --> 30:03.885
but you're going through
the five stages.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.430
You just made
a completely seamless
transition from anger

30:07.556 --> 30:08.931
to bargaining.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.602
Cover two more
of my clinic hours,

30:12.728 --> 30:15.438
and you can have
your one procedure.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.574
No lesions, no aneurysms.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.953
Ironically,
the mind of a killer
looks completely normal.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.582
If someone asked you
to describe me to them,

30:34.708 --> 30:37.502
what's the first thing
you'd tell them?

30:37.628 --> 30:38.711
Insecure.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.215
What are you asking?

30:42.341 --> 30:44.592
Like if you were setting me up
on a blind date.

30:44.718 --> 30:49.597
Would you describe me
to the girl as the black guy?
A neurologist?

30:49.723 --> 30:51.182
Car thief?

30:51.308 --> 30:54.227
This guy's really
getting to you, isn't he?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.800
There's no sign of infection.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.304
You're gonna
have to do the biopsy.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.600
Your death row
guy's still here.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.271
Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta
get him stabilized.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.607
Probably keep him on fluids
for a few more hours,
then off he goes.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.695
Oh, yeah?
'Cause I'm figuring that
you still think he's sick.

31:47.322 --> 31:52.159
Figuring requires deductive
reasoning. I'm figuring
that you did no figuring.

31:52.286 --> 31:57.248
Stacy just ratted me out,
right? So much for
attorney-client privilege.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.626
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty
to this hospital.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.379
- Right.
- I'm sending him back to prison.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.464
Can't. Court order.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.592
Court order says he has to be
declared healthy.

32:07.718 --> 32:11.596
Doesn't specify
which doctor needs
to make that declaration.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.391
What is it, Clarence?
My gut!

32:15.517 --> 32:17.977
Would you describe it
as a shooting pain?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.604
A throbbing pain?

32:19.730 --> 32:23.524
Or maybe an imaginary pain
because you don't want
to go back to prison?

32:23.650 --> 32:27.028
- Where does it hurt?
- My gut, like I'm getting stabbed!

32:27.154 --> 32:29.655
Well, he'd know.
Let me take a look.

32:31.241 --> 32:34.493
Oh, so everybody lies
except a convicted murderer?

32:45.213 --> 32:47.715
I don't think
he's faking this stuff.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.301
What do you think, Doctor?

33:07.944 --> 33:09.945
I didn't have any choice.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.492
No, you had to tell Cuddy.
She's your boss, I get it.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.245
Hitler thought he was doing
the world a favor, too.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.289
Yeah, pretty much
on that same level.

33:20.415 --> 33:23.292
Gandhi didn't march to the sea
because his buddies
asked him to.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.295
Pol Pot didn't wipe out
the teachers because he
wanted to make friends.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.048
You're not
making friends right now.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.385
- I trusted you.
- I know.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.349
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.604
I had to do
what I thought was right.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.607
It's the only reason
anybody does anything.

33:49.236 --> 33:52.905
Surgery went fine.
They removed almost
a foot of necrotic bowel.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.324
They're shackling him
and taking him into recovery.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.742
I wonder.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.331
I wonder why Clarence killed
that second inmate?

34:04.251 --> 34:07.128
Fine, I'll bite.
What the hell
are you talking about?

34:07.254 --> 34:08.921
Everything we do

34:09.881 --> 34:13.175
is dictated by motive.
Why did he kill
his girlfriend?

34:13.301 --> 34:16.137
- Because he's a maniac!
- Is that the reason he gave?

34:16.263 --> 34:18.222
She was cheating on him.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.435
Jealousy.
That gets him sent to prison.

34:23.437 --> 34:26.605
Where he kills
inmate number one. Why?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.607
Guy attacked him first.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.359
Revenge.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.404
- Who'd he kill after that?
- Prison guard.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.490
Who had a file
full of abuse complaints.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.034
Probably been kicking
Clarence's ass for months.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.328
Clarence is just ridding
the world of bad seeds.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.414
We'll call that one
retribution.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.251
Then he kills
inmate number two.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.254
Anybody know why?

34:51.006 --> 34:52.006
Uh-uh.

34:52.132 --> 34:53.716
It's not in there.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.183
All of a sudden,
I gotta have a reason?

35:02.309 --> 35:05.478
It's an anomaly.
Doctors love anomalies.

35:06.438 --> 35:10.483
Dark spot on an x-ray,
bright spot on an MRI.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.401
Killing that second inmate

35:12.527 --> 35:16.697
was the homicidal equivalent
of blood in the urine.
It doesn't fit.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.534
I'm interested in things
that don't fit.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.578
Tell me why you did it.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.461
Your other victims
you were almost
bragging about.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.798
What was different
about this guy?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.429
It happened
when I was in gen pop.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.810
I was in the library,
just reading.

35:48.438 --> 35:53.025
And I started feeling
real nervous.
This guy was staring at me.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.821
I could feel his eyes
digging holes
in the back of my neck.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.323
Made me feel crazy.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.661
Sweat was
pouring down my face.

36:04.788 --> 36:08.958
I could hear my heartbeat
racing in my ears.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.088
I just raged out on the dude.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.179
So what's the differential
for raging out?

36:22.305 --> 36:25.349
- Excess testosterone, steroids.
- Adrenalin?

36:25.475 --> 36:28.310
- Prep Clarence for surgery.
- Care to share with the class?

36:28.436 --> 36:32.898
Oh, come on,
do I have to spell it out
for you? Pheochromocytoma.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.817
Actually, I'm not sure
how you spell it.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.443
But you said it yourself,
adrenalin.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.154
Pheochromocytoma sits on top
of the adrenal gland,

36:39.281 --> 36:41.532
randomly spits out
oodles of the stuff.
It's perfect.

36:41.658 --> 36:45.286
It explains everything, the
tachycardia, pulmonary edema,
the vasoconstriction that

36:45.412 --> 36:46.453
caused the necrotic bowel.

36:46.580 --> 36:49.331
Even explains
how he had the strength
to rip the rail off his bed.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.501
- But pheo's extremely rare.
- I love rare.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.337
Set up an MRI.
Where's Cameron?

36:56.673 --> 36:58.465
Like I don't know.

37:04.139 --> 37:06.557
Dr. Cameron, could I
borrow you for a consult?

37:06.683 --> 37:09.476
Bittersweet thing
about being head
of the Oncology Department,

37:09.603 --> 37:12.229
I get cc'd on all
the biopsy results.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.564
Yeah, I know.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.192
- She's terminal.
- Yeah.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.821
So I take it you were
in there informing her?

37:20.947 --> 37:24.575
Well, I hadn't exactly
gotten around to that,
but I was just...

37:24.701 --> 37:27.036
Doing what? Making friends?

37:29.122 --> 37:30.331
Cindy's divorced.

37:30.457 --> 37:33.334
She doesn't have any kids,
no siblings,
both her parents are gone...

37:33.460 --> 37:36.754
It's not your job
to be her friend!
Do you understand?

37:36.880 --> 37:38.672
And it's not worth it.

37:39.466 --> 37:43.218
She feels better her final
few days, and you're not
the same, maybe for years.

37:43.345 --> 37:46.847
- You don't think it's worth it?
- I know it's not worth it.

37:51.811 --> 37:53.395
My husband...

37:58.610 --> 38:03.072
I met him just after
he was diagnosed
with terminal brain cancer.

38:03.198 --> 38:08.118
If I hadn't married him...
He was alone.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.707
When a good person dies,
there should be an impact
on the world.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.460
Somebody should notice.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.088
Somebody should be upset.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.469
"Pheo" what?

38:26.471 --> 38:28.263
I don't even remember.

38:28.390 --> 38:32.476
It's just a fancy way
of saying "small,
adrenalin-secreting tumor".

38:33.311 --> 38:35.479
Yeah,
that clarified it for you.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.025
All you need to know is,
if I'm right, we can fix it.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.361
Just gotta find it first.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.321
We need an MRI.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.532
It's completely painless
for most people.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.325
But not for me?

38:48.451 --> 38:51.412
I assume you got
those tattoos in prison.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.290
Prison tats often contain
inks with heavy metals.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.251
The MRI is basically
a giant magnet,

38:57.377 --> 39:00.462
suck those metallic inks
right out of your skin.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.697
Stop squirming.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.991
Don't make us do this again.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.453
Big baby.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.205
Still don't see anything.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.959
Turn it off!

39:39.586 --> 39:41.211
There's Waldo.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.214
Found it, Clarence.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.758
Turn it off!

39:45.884 --> 39:47.676
Turn this damn thing off!

39:47.802 --> 39:50.804
Keep him in there
until you guys see it, too.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.890
Son of a bitch.

40:01.691 --> 40:04.818
Looks like they got
the pheo out successfully.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.613
So, what now?

40:08.490 --> 40:10.574
Clarence goes back
to death row.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.493
Just like that?

40:12.619 --> 40:14.078
He's cured.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.581
That tumor caused
random shots of adrenalin,

40:17.707 --> 40:21.251
which obviously led
to the rage attacks that
made him become a murderer

40:21.377 --> 40:22.836
in the first place.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.421
My God, you're right!

40:24.547 --> 40:27.174
Let's call the surgeons,
we gotta save that tumor.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.342
Put it on the witness stand.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.345
We could testify
at Clarence's appeal.

40:31.471 --> 40:35.891
You smell that?
I think that is the stink
of hypocrisy.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.894
You wouldn't even consider
the notion that Clarence's
social upbringing

40:39.020 --> 40:42.356
was responsible for what
he became, but now you're
sprinting to the witness stand

40:42.482 --> 40:44.066
to blame everything
on a little tumor.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.819
A person's upbringing
and their biology
are completely different.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.278
Yeah.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.948
Because you only
overcame one of them.

40:52.158 --> 40:55.327
Well, let's just
give Clarence a free pass.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.747
Which is probably
gonna piss off all those
other pheo sufferers

40:58.873 --> 41:00.707
who managed to control
their rage attacks

41:00.834 --> 41:04.586
and become lawyers,
race car drivers,
or even doctors.

41:04.712 --> 41:09.258
Removing that tumor
puts a stop to those
random shots of adrenalin.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.635
It doesn't absolve him.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.929
You want him to be executed?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.349
That's not what I'm saying.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.685
Got an opinion?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.521
Everyone's got an opinion.

41:27.986 --> 41:32.865
I... I think I'm gonna testify
at Clarence's appeal.

41:34.117 --> 41:36.493
You'll do
what you think is right.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.329
On your own time.

41:55.096 --> 41:57.598
But it's just a cough.
