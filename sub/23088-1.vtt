Well, I'm going to be

12:39.842 --> 12:41.427
a big disappointment,

12:41.469 --> 12:42.428
because the only time

12:42.470 --> 12:44.804
I ever tried to make a casserole,

12:44.805 --> 12:47.640
I ended up close, personal friends

12:47.641 --> 12:48.641
with the fire chief.

12:48.642 --> 12:49.809
[laughs]

12:49.810 --> 12:52.479
Well, don't worry, my freezer is full, anyway.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.731
Look,

12:53.773 --> 12:56.692
our first two interactions were questionable at best,

12:56.734 --> 12:58.318
so why don't we try this one more time?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.487
I am Father Tim Kavanaugh,

12:59.528 --> 13:01.488
and it is a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Coppersmith.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.615
Your uncle has told me

13:02.656 --> 13:04.533
so many wonderful things about you.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.495
Is there anybody he didn't talk to about me?

13:07.536 --> 13:08.537
Around here,

13:08.579 --> 13:10.663
everyone talks to everyone about everything,

13:10.664 --> 13:11.540
and if you know that,

13:11.582 --> 13:14.334
you will do just fine.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.961
Got it.

13:24.094 --> 13:24.929
[chuckling]

13:24.970 --> 13:25.930
Hal, please ask me to dance

13:25.971 --> 13:27.556
before my belly gets so big

13:27.598 --> 13:29.600
that we cannot even reach each other.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.018
You got it, baby.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.478
Look out.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.358
♪ When I'm without you I think about you ♪

13:37.399 --> 13:41.362
♪ Can't get you out of my mind ♪

13:42.363 --> 13:45.032

13:45.866 --> 13:47.034
Excuse me.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.996
May I have this dance, ma'am?

13:51.038 --> 13:52.331
Sure.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.253

14:07.596 --> 14:10.140

14:12.351 --> 14:13.393
Thanks.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.729
[laughs]Thanks.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.730
Nice guy,

14:16.731 --> 14:18.565
but not too light on his feet.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.650
How are your toes?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.694
I'll let you know when I get the x-rays back.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.695
Hmm.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.948
♪ Let's stay together Now and forever ♪

14:25.990 --> 14:29.243
Why is everyone staring at us?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.870
Well, Mitford doesn't get a lot of newcomers,

14:31.912 --> 14:33.414
especially like you.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.748
What does that mean?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.333
Glamorous, big city author,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.751
probably doesn't have a pair of jeans to her name.

14:38.752 --> 14:39.962
I have a lot of jeans.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.132
They said it was a party, so I wore my party clothes.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.842
[chuckles]

14:44.884 --> 14:47.678
You know, I feel a little bit

14:47.720 --> 14:49.388
like I am under a microscope.

14:50.931 --> 14:51.849
Yeah, that's Sally.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.601
She has a tendency to do that.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.603
She's very sweet,

14:55.644 --> 14:57.771
but she's...

14:57.813 --> 14:58.856
she's a little young for me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.274
I'm not interested.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.609
Not interested?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.236
You're a priest!

15:04.278 --> 15:05.404
Episcopal priest.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.488
Oh!

15:06.530 --> 15:08.532
So, the dating and everything's okay?

15:08.574 --> 15:11.994
Yes, dating and everything is okay...

15:12.036 --> 15:13.871
but when you live in a town this size,

15:13.913 --> 15:16.582
if she's not here now,

15:16.624 --> 15:18.458
she probably never will be.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.293
Well, do you ever think about moving?

15:20.294 --> 15:21.462
No. Never.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.962
I love this place. I love it here.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.465
I love the community and the people.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.383
We're like a family,

15:26.425 --> 15:27.801
albeit an unconventional family,

15:27.843 --> 15:29.094
but family.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.971
That's what I remember when I used to visit my uncle.

15:31.972 --> 15:35.392
I am putting a lot of pressure on Mitford

15:35.434 --> 15:37.311
to get my next book written.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.645
I'm a little stuck.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.772
Hmm.

15:39.813 --> 15:40.980
Well, that happens to everyone.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.024
Don't be too hard on yourself.

15:42.066 --> 15:46.195
The best thing to do when there's a block

15:46.236 --> 15:48.988
is to try to find the underlying fear,

15:48.989 --> 15:51.867
because often, that's... that's the cause.

15:51.909 --> 15:52.910
At least, that's what I tell people

15:52.951 --> 15:55.662
when they come to me for advice.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.830
You think I'm scared?

15:57.831 --> 15:58.791
I didn't say that.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.501
I said I've seen that in others.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.878
It was just a suggestion.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.048
Writing's a process. I'll get over it.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.549
Okay, I didn't mean to...

16:07.591 --> 16:08.675
Father Tim!

16:08.676 --> 16:10.677
You did promise me a dance tonight.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.429
He's all yours.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.026
May I have this dance, Ms. Coppersmith?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.696
Does everybody know everything

16:28.737 --> 16:29.862
in Mitford?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.365
That's right.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.616
I'm Jack Emery.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.702
Nice to meet you, Jack Emery.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.369
You know, I was going to stay home tonight

16:36.370 --> 16:37.496
and catch up on some work,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.331
but now I'm really glad I didn't.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.437
I am so glad that you came.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.105
Good night!

17:03.147 --> 17:04.440
Zoey!

17:04.481 --> 17:05.858
Can we give you a ride home?

17:05.898 --> 17:06.817
Ah, you know,

17:06.858 --> 17:07.900
it's such a beautiful night,

17:07.901 --> 17:08.901
I think I'll walk.

17:08.902 --> 17:09.903
Okay. Good night.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.029
Good night.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.664
I'm surprised you turned down that ride.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.499
Why? It's a beautiful night.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.791
Well, you never know

17:23.834 --> 17:25.711
what lurks in the dark in Mitford.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.712
I live in Boston.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.714
I'm not afraid.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.216
Let me walk you home.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.634
Wouldn't be very neighborly of me

17:32.676 --> 17:34.887
to let you walk home alone in the dark,

17:34.928 --> 17:36.889
even if you can totally handle it.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.640
Okay.

17:43.812 --> 17:44.813
Look...

17:44.855 --> 17:47.274
I'm sorry if I got too personal back there.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.443
People tend to come to me for counsel,

17:49.485 --> 17:50.694
and then I don't know

17:50.736 --> 17:52.237
when to push the "off" button.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.280
Even your uncle used to.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.282
You know,

17:55.324 --> 17:57.034
some people even say I'm good at it.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.621
Yeah, but do they have any other choice around here?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.248
[laughs]They do not.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.626
They are stuck with me and only me.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.629
You were only trying to help.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.507
I'm sure it's an occupational hazard,

18:11.548 --> 18:13.217
and I'm fine.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.802
It just happens, you know?

18:14.843 --> 18:17.554
You get stuck, and then you get a breakthrough.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.264
Mm.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.476
This shoe is... sorry. It's okay.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.852
Boots and sneakers.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.187
What's that?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.188
That's what people wear around here.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.731
They wear boots and sneakers.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.148
I guess my city girl is showing.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.316
Well, you'll learn.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.109
I'm sorry.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.612
My strap is just...

18:33.654 --> 18:35.489
Oh, wait. Oh, dear...

18:35.531 --> 18:36.532
[screams]

18:36.573 --> 18:37.657
Oof!

18:37.658 --> 18:38.492
Ahh...

18:38.534 --> 18:39.743
Oh, gosh. Oh!

18:39.785 --> 18:41.327
[laughing]

18:41.328 --> 18:42.496
I'm sorry!

18:42.538 --> 18:43.288
Are you okay?

18:43.330 --> 18:45.457
Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.499
My strap broke.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.669
Oh, that shoe!

18:48.710 --> 18:50.462
Boots and sneakers!

18:50.504 --> 18:51.505
You sure you're okay?

18:51.547 --> 18:52.714
I'm fine.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.757
Good.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.007
We should be careful, though.

18:55.008 --> 18:58.095
People see us like this, they might start to talk.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.097
Seems like people talk here

19:00.138 --> 19:01.347
no matter what you do.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.432
That, too.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.433
[car approaching]

19:03.475 --> 19:04.476
Oh!

19:07.604 --> 19:08.564
Hi!

19:08.605 --> 19:09.690
Hi! Everything okay?

19:09.731 --> 19:11.275
There we go.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.859
Oh, I, uh...

19:12.860 --> 19:14.194
I broke my shoe.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.279
Well, it's a good thing I drove by.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.198
Get in. I'll take you both home.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.867
Thanks.

19:20.868 --> 19:21.785
Um...

19:21.827 --> 19:23.704
Okay, I'll probably just walk.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.539
My shoes are intact, so...

19:25.581 --> 19:26.707
'Night, neighbor.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.208
Good night.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.501
Boots and sneakers!

19:43.891 --> 19:45.183
Father Tim!

19:45.225 --> 19:47.560
I didn't know you had a dog.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.562
Neither did I.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.646
He's a stray.

19:49.688 --> 19:53.734
Always doing the Lord's work, aren't you?

19:53.775 --> 19:56.028
By the way, my niece is in town.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.904
You two have so much in common.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.239
Do we?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.073
She's an animal person, too,

20:01.074 --> 20:02.868
and she likes pizza.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.536
It's almost eerie.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.747
Some lucky woman will land you yet, Father Tim.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.583
Mark my words.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.835
I just hope it's my niece.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.879
Right, Penny? Mm?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.589
We're going to go home now. Yes, we are.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.052
Well, he's definitely a healthy puppy, Tim.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.053
He's a puppy?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.721
He's the size of an SUV.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.805
Is he going to get even bigger?

20:23.847 --> 20:26.391
That's usually how that works, yeah.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.686
I've never seen him before. He's got no chip.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.812
He's kind of a mystery.

20:30.854 --> 20:31.939
Hmm.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.482
Well, I guess I'll put some flyers around town

20:33.523 --> 20:34.608
or something.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.818
Pretty smart, him choosing you as his new owner.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.613
I am not keeping him, Hal.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.782
It is a proven fact pets make you live longer.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.034
Ah.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.327
Of course,

20:45.369 --> 20:48.287
having a wife could make you live even longer than that.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.331
And all this time,

20:49.373 --> 20:51.290
I thought it was healthy eating and exercise

20:51.291 --> 20:52.959
that did the trick.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.002
Look at that.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.213
He wants to stay with you, Hal.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.463
He's going to love it here

20:57.464 --> 20:59.299
with the family and all this space.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.260
No, no, no. We are at full capacity here.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.803
Marge said she would divorce me

21:03.804 --> 21:05.180
if I brought home any more strays,

21:05.222 --> 21:07.640
and after all that pre-marriage counseling you gave us,

21:07.641 --> 21:09.768
can't imagine you'd want to see that happen.

21:09.810 --> 21:10.810
Well played, my friend.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.811
Well played.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.813
I will keep him until I find his owner.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.940
Well, come on, Dog.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.066
No, whoa, whoa.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.901
You can't call him "Dog."

21:17.943 --> 21:19.069
You've got to give him a proper name.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.319
He may already have a name,

21:20.320 --> 21:22.531
and I don't want to give him an identity crisis.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.242
Well, he's definitely not a Max or a Rex.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.369
What does he look like?

21:27.411 --> 21:28.870
Like a guy I went to seminary with.

21:28.912 --> 21:29.871
Excuse me?

21:29.913 --> 21:30.914
Same eyes,

21:30.956 --> 21:33.083
and he also used to come over uninvited

21:33.125 --> 21:35.167
and eat me out of house and home, so...

21:35.168 --> 21:36.670
there you have it.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.587
Until further notice,

21:37.629 --> 21:39.798
you will be known as Barnabas.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.134
No? Come on! I like it!

21:42.175 --> 21:43.343
Yeah, that'll do.
Okay.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.553
I'll give you two a lift.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.138
You can't haul him around on that thing you drive.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.514
We walked, actually.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.600
See? You're acting like a natural dog owner already.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.025
Hey, Father Tim!

21:58.066 --> 21:58.984
Russell!
Hey, Dooley.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.820
Hey.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.407
Father Tim, I can't thank you enough

22:05.449 --> 22:07.075
for offering to watch my grandson.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.535
I didn't know what to do with him

22:08.577 --> 22:10.412
after school let out for the summer.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.080
Oh, it's my pleasure.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.040
It'll be nice to have some help around here.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.210
His official title will be "intern..."

22:17.252 --> 22:19.087
[whispering] so he doesn't feel like he needs a babysitter.

22:19.129 --> 22:22.674
Good thinking. Dooley, come on over.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.716
Say hello to Father Tim.

22:23.717 --> 22:24.760
Hey, Dooley.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.511
Hi.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.514
Have you met Barnabas?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.019
Yeah!

22:35.187 --> 22:36.855
[laughs]

22:36.897 --> 22:38.899
He's gotten a little withdrawn

22:38.940 --> 22:40.567
since his parents were deployed.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.527
It's never easy when they're on a tour.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.737
I'll get his mind off it. Don't you worry.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.989
We're going to have some fun. Right, Dooley?

22:49.576 --> 22:51.745
Maybe you could help me find his owner.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.746
He's not yours?

22:52.788 --> 22:53.955
Sure thinks he is.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.791
[Barnabas barks]

22:55.832 --> 22:58.250
He's trying to tell you something right now, you know.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.294
Do you speak dog?

22:59.336 --> 23:01.046
There's no such thing.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.881
What? Course there is.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.216
You've just got to give it time.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.300
Right now, he's telling you

23:05.342 --> 23:06.968
that he wants you to throw that ball for him.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.386
I'll do it,

23:08.428 --> 23:10.555
but he never said that.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.558
I'll get him out of his shell. Don't you worry.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.686
Oh, once he gets comfortable, he's a fun kid.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.979
He's a prankster.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.732
Yesterday, I walked around town with a post-it on my back

23:20.774 --> 23:23.735
that said, "I'm a hundred years old today."

23:23.777 --> 23:25.444
Didn't know why strangers were telling me

23:25.445 --> 23:27.155
I looked so good for my age.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.074
Well, I'll be sure to watch my back, then.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.075
Thank you, Father Tim.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.493
Okay, you got it.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.998
[door chimes]

23:37.040 --> 23:37.958
Hi!

23:37.999 --> 23:38.959
Oh, hi!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.960
I have that book you ordered.

23:40.961 --> 23:41.920
Great.

23:41.962 --> 23:45.006
And I also heard a little rumor

23:45.048 --> 23:46.591
about you and Cynthia

23:46.633 --> 23:49.761
rolling around on the ground?

23:49.803 --> 23:50.929
[sighs]

23:50.971 --> 23:53.056
Marge, she fell down,

23:53.098 --> 23:54.640
and she took me with her.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.475
Oh, really?

23:55.476 --> 23:56.935
Don't believe everything you hear.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.144
'Kay, that's why I'm asking you...

23:58.145 --> 24:00.813
'cause I always vet my rumors for accuracy.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.315
[door bell rings]

24:02.357 --> 24:03.650
Well, thankfully,

24:03.692 --> 24:05.317
this knight in shining armor came by and gave her a lift.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.486
Well, it was a good thing I have a car,

24:06.528 --> 24:08.154
because she was really struggling in those shoes.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.197
Mm.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.574
Mm.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.409
Marge, I want every one of her books.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.993
I need to know everything there is to know

24:13.994 --> 24:15.453
about that woman.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.662
It's been a while

24:16.663 --> 24:18.164
since someone made my heart skip a beat like that.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.166
Great.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.334
And you, you got the lucky geography.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.296
Right next door.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.255
I don't know her very well,

24:25.297 --> 24:26.298
but she certainly seems...

24:26.339 --> 24:27.257
I know.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.507
Really great.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.677
Not often you meet a woman like that in Mitford.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.512
Aren't you going back to Atlanta?

24:33.513 --> 24:35.514
Once I sell my father's properties, yes,

24:35.515 --> 24:37.434
but there's a lot of real estate I need to sell.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.019
May just keep me here as long as she is.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.353
Huh. Well...

24:41.354 --> 24:43.273
she is here to work.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.274
Well, so am I.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.151
We're kindred spirits.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.069
What are the odds of that happening, huh?

24:48.111 --> 24:50.322
Oh, I need to show a property across the street right now,

24:50.363 --> 24:52.115
so I'll be back to pick up the books later.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.366
Okay.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.619
I've got to read them all before I take Cynthia to dinner

24:55.660 --> 24:57.162
at the country club tomorrow night.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.204
She's going out with you?

24:58.205 --> 24:59.164
Well, she doesn't know it yet,

24:59.206 --> 25:00.999
but she will.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.628
[doorbell chimes]

25:26.233 --> 25:27.233
Morning.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.235
Morning!

25:31.571 --> 25:34.199
Now, you mind Father Tim, and I'll see you tonight, 'Kay?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.201
I want to come with you.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.911
Dooley, we've been over this.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.704
Now come on.

25:40.872 --> 25:41.915
[car door shuts]

25:45.460 --> 25:47.087
Aw...

25:47.128 --> 25:48.088
I got him, I got him.

25:48.129 --> 25:48.964
Who's a good boy?

25:49.005 --> 25:50.089
Hey, Dooley,

25:50.090 --> 25:51.716
I made up those flyers I was telling you about,

25:51.758 --> 25:53.510
to try and find Barnabas's owner.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.345
What do you say we put them up?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.931
If we find his owner, would you have to give him back?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.349
I would, I would.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.267
That's what he would want.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.477
How do you know?

26:02.519 --> 26:04.020
I told you. I speak dog.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.522
You're weird.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.649
Maybe so, but I am bilingual.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.325
Hey.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.442
[Cynthia sighs]

26:50.483 --> 26:52.611
[phone rings]

26:53.903 --> 26:54.988
Cynthia! Hi.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.156
It's Jack Emery.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.407
Hi, Jack.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.657
Thanks again for the ride the other night.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.161
Those shoes were not my best judgment call.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.162
[chuckles]

27:02.163 --> 27:03.246
Well, we live and we learn, right?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.456
I'm just happy I showed up when I did.

27:04.497 --> 27:05.664
Tell me about it.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.292
Listen, the reason I'm calling is...

27:09.252 --> 27:10.462
I want to take you to dinner.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.548
Tomorrow night, at the country club.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.592
Best spaghetti bolognese on the planet.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.136
They've got articles written about it.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.971
Wow, that sounds amazing!

27:20.013 --> 27:21.513
Thank you so much, Jack!

27:21.514 --> 27:23.224
Um...

27:23.266 --> 27:25.684
you know, I am kind of on a roll here,

27:25.685 --> 27:27.437
and I've got so much work to do.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.938
Maybe another time?

27:30.148 --> 27:31.523
I completely understand.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.485
Work is important.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.819
Another time.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.528
Oh, well.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.822
Thanks again, Jack.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.662
Ow!

27:45.955 --> 27:48.041
Ow!

27:48.083 --> 27:49.334
Oh, buddy!

27:49.376 --> 27:50.502
Are you okay?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.212
Oh, man, that's a nasty little scrape there.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.588
I'll grab my first-aid kit.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.673
All right, you come with me.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.215
I'll help you up.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.510
Let's go sit down.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.930
Take it easy. Oh, that's too bad.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.934
It's okay if I take a look at it?

28:07.519 --> 28:10.563
I'm Cynthia, your neighbor. What's your name?

28:10.605 --> 28:12.065
Dooley.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.066
Well...

28:13.108 --> 28:14.526
you know what?

28:14.567 --> 28:16.235
That doesn't look so bad.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.529
You might live.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.947
[laughs]

28:20.740 --> 28:22.784
This might sting just a little.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.285
Ow!

28:24.327 --> 28:25.203
Ow!

28:25.245 --> 28:27.789
Look how brave you are.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.958
Do you know what bravery calls for?

28:29.999 --> 28:31.167
A reward.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.503
How about some lemonade?

28:33.545 --> 28:34.504
Okay.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.381
Wow, that's it.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.061
Here we are.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.565
You have more books here than the library.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.692
Most of them were my uncle's books.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.235
He loved books.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.445
How did you know that?

28:59.446 --> 29:00.864
I've borrowed most of these.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.574
He was very generous with his books.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.533
You liked him.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.909
Everyone liked Frank,

29:04.951 --> 29:06.995
and maybe that's why the town has taken to you so quickly.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.246
Either that,

29:08.288 --> 29:10.457
or they look at me like I'm some sort of alien form.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.501
You know, we have met other city people before.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.669
You're not our first,

29:14.711 --> 29:17.338
and they have taken to you, trust me.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.423
Marge, Hal...

29:19.466 --> 29:20.425
Jack.

29:20.467 --> 29:21.801
Maybe it's the familial link.

29:21.843 --> 29:26.681
You know, my uncle really encouraged me to read,

29:26.723 --> 29:28.641
and that led to my writing.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.143
How's that going?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.811
Great.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.732
I know you're not asking for advice,

29:35.773 --> 29:37.025
and I certainly wouldn't give you any,

29:37.066 --> 29:38.735
but sometimes,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.653
when you focus so hard on what's not working,

29:41.654 --> 29:43.781
you can actually make the block worse.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.205
Dooley!

29:50.246 --> 29:51.498
Violet's letting you pet her.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.291
She never lets anybody pet her,

29:53.333 --> 29:54.666
except for me, and I feed her.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.669
She likes you.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.755
Well, I made two friends today...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.172
Violet and you.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.299
Here you go, Dooley.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.092
Your grandfather's going to be here soon, okay?

30:06.638 --> 30:09.724
Thanks for the un-advice.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.559
I wouldn't dream of giving you any,

30:11.601 --> 30:13.061
and you're welcome.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.029
Hi!

30:23.071 --> 30:24.530
Hi, Marge!

30:24.531 --> 30:26.199
I'm looking for a book for a 10-year-old boy.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.368
10-year-old boy...

30:28.409 --> 30:30.203
I know just the one.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
Ta-dah!

30:35.041 --> 30:36.042
Narnia!

30:36.084 --> 30:37.794
You are the Book Whisperer, Marge.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.504
I've always been a book worm,

30:39.546 --> 30:41.422
and I am saving a spot for your next book,

30:41.464 --> 30:42.507
right here.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.466
Oh...

30:43.508 --> 30:45.635
well, you might be waiting a while.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.222
I mean, these things take time to be published.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.641
Little writer's block?

30:51.683 --> 30:54.393
No secrets in Mitford.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.854
Not a one.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.939
Look, I don't mean to be nosy,

30:57.981 --> 31:00.858
but I personally don't think there's such a thing

31:00.900 --> 31:02.068
as writer's block.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.195
I think it's all there, it's just hiding, you know?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.738
I think the best thing for writer's block

31:05.780 --> 31:08.199
is a completely unrelated activity.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.075
Like gardening.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.410
Or dinner...

31:10.451 --> 31:11.578
with a handsome man...

31:12.745 --> 31:14.539
with someone that some may call

31:14.581 --> 31:16.958
the most eligible bachelor in Mitford.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.712
That's not the direction I was going in at all.

31:20.753 --> 31:22.463
Well, maybe it should be.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.882
I don't know.

31:23.923 --> 31:26.968
It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.803
Well, I think it's the perfect activity

31:28.845 --> 31:30.096
for taking your mind off that book.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.763
Just try something new and different.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.349
Step off that ledge,

31:33.391 --> 31:34.559
and break through that block.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.227
You know what?

31:36.269 --> 31:37.436
You're right.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.604
I'm going to do it.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.815
I'm going to call up Jack Emery

31:40.857 --> 31:43.609
and tell him I'll have dinner with him.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.361
Thank you, Marge.

31:47.030 --> 31:51.534
I was talking about Father Tim, so...

31:54.329 --> 31:55.371
Thank you.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.706
[phone vibrates]

31:56.748 --> 31:58.499
So then I moved to Atlanta permanently

31:58.541 --> 31:59.959
and I switched

32:00.001 --> 32:01.336
to commercial real estate.

32:01.377 --> 32:02.461
[phone vibrates again]

32:02.462 --> 32:03.338
I mean, I'd sold just about every property

32:03.379 --> 32:04.631
in Mitford anyway.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.260
You can answer it.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.512
No, you know what?

32:11.554 --> 32:12.847
They can wait.

32:12.889 --> 32:13.890
[phone stops]

32:13.932 --> 32:16.392
People aren't nearly present enough nowadays,

32:16.434 --> 32:18.811
and when you're sitting across from such a beautiful woman,

32:18.853 --> 32:21.064
that's where your attention should be.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.733
So you said that you're only here

32:23.775 --> 32:24.817
until the house is sold?

32:24.859 --> 32:26.027
Pretty much.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.529
I need a good realtor, if you could recommend one.

32:28.571 --> 32:31.490
Well, I actually know a great one...

32:31.491 --> 32:32.659
me.

32:32.700 --> 32:33.701
Now, I don't really do residential anymore,

32:33.743 --> 32:34.827
but I still have my license,

32:34.869 --> 32:37.372
so I could do it for you.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.623
Oh, thank you.

32:38.665 --> 32:39.874
Well, it's important to be guided

32:39.916 --> 32:41.417
by someone you can trust.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.834
So when do you want to list it?

32:42.835 --> 32:44.253
In about a month.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.091
That's, uh... that's soon.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.592
You getting sick of old Mitford already?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.593
No...

32:50.635 --> 32:52.553
actually, not at all.

32:52.595 --> 32:53.930
It's just...

32:53.971 --> 32:55.180
I came hereto write my book,

32:55.181 --> 32:57.141
and I've got to get back to my real life.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.644
I know what you mean. Me, too.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.230
So...

33:02.271 --> 33:05.857
what is your real life like in Atlanta?

33:05.858 --> 33:07.652
It's good.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.528
I mean, it could be better.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.572
After my divorce, I, uh...

33:11.614 --> 33:12.782
I threw myself into my work.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.826
It was a necessary distraction...

33:14.867 --> 33:17.620
but now that I'm three years away from it,

33:17.662 --> 33:19.789
I feel like I want more again.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.916
Yeah, well...

33:21.958 --> 33:23.126
I'm only one year away,

33:23.167 --> 33:26.003
so I guess I have something to look forward to.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.548
It gets better. Trust me

33:28.589 --> 33:29.549
I know.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.634
Every day...

33:31.676 --> 33:33.845
but I appreciate you saying it.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.389
You're welcome.

33:36.431 --> 33:40.018
One thing I'll say Mitford did get right, though...

33:40.059 --> 33:41.269
it introduced us.

33:43.896 --> 33:45.022
[glasses clink]

33:51.612 --> 33:53.906
Thanks for dinner.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.574
I was hoping it was the first of many.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.742
[barking]

33:56.743 --> 33:58.953
Barnabas! No, no, no, no, no! You are so grounded!

33:58.995 --> 34:00.538
Guys, I am so sorry.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.831
I apologize.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.291
I opened the door, and he just bolted right out,

34:03.332 --> 34:04.625
and I couldn't stop him 'cause I had these in my hands.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.917
I...

34:05.918 --> 34:06.918
Jack.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.129
Tim.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.715
These are from Barnabas.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.717
He is eternally sorry and begs for your forgiveness.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.926
Well, Barnabas, you are eternally forgiven.

34:14.927 --> 34:16.429
[laughs]

34:16.471 --> 34:18.096
Okay, all right. Let's go.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.016
Let's go, big guy. Let's go. Here we go!

34:20.056 --> 34:21.933
We're going on our walk. Come on.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.268
[Barnabas whines]

34:23.268 --> 34:24.520
Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.605
Sorry.

34:25.646 --> 34:26.938
Good night.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.274
Good night.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.150
Uh, sorry.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.235
-Good night.
-Good night, Jack.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.614
All right, Barnabas, this walk was your idea!

34:34.655 --> 34:36.447
Come on!

34:36.449 --> 34:38.117
Um...

34:38.159 --> 34:39.577
well, either you come for a walk with us,

34:39.619 --> 34:40.619
or Barnabas is going to be living with you from now on.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.163
Sure, I'll come.

34:42.205 --> 34:42.955
Yeah?

34:42.996 --> 34:44.248
Boots or sneakers?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.583
Boots.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.626
Boots it is.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.253
See, I'm adapting.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.299
Barnabas!

34:53.341 --> 34:55.176
What're you doing?

34:55.217 --> 34:57.178
What're you doing, man?

34:58.721 --> 35:00.472
Well, I'm sorry if I ruined your date.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.641
Oh, you didn't.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.683
Maybe Barnabas did,

35:02.725 --> 35:05.061
but the azaleas make up for it.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.063
So how was it?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.146
It was good.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.066
I just couldn't get my mind off my book,

35:10.108 --> 35:11.150
or the lack thereof.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.986
My deadline is less than a month.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.948
So, what did you do if that happened in the past?

35:16.989 --> 35:19.242
Well, the thing is, it never used to happen.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.660
If I felt like I was going in the wrong direction,

35:21.661 --> 35:23.328
I would just talk to my ex.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.331
I had someone to bounce ideas off of,

35:25.373 --> 35:28.835
someone to help me get back on track.

35:28.876 --> 35:29.919
And now?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.505
Well, I guess he's sharing his creative energy

35:32.547 --> 35:34.590
with his new wife.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.970
Have you ever been married?

35:39.011 --> 35:41.514
I've been engaged, but it didn't work out.

35:42.932 --> 35:44.100
Well, at least you had the good sense

35:44.141 --> 35:46.644
to back out before you made a big mistake.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.312
Actually, I didn't.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.522
She did.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.857
Oh... I'm sorry.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.025
No, she couldn't see herself

35:53.067 --> 35:54.318
as the pastor's wife.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.570
It's...

35:55.611 --> 35:56.654
it's a different sort of path.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.447
I mean, I think giving back

35:58.489 --> 36:00.575
is one of the most rewarding experiences

36:00.616 --> 36:02.033
anyone could ever have,

36:02.034 --> 36:05.121
but she didn't really seethe benefits like I did...

36:05.163 --> 36:06.831
and plus, I couldn't share everything with her

36:06.873 --> 36:09.834
because of the confidentiality aspect,

36:09.876 --> 36:11.168
so...

36:11.210 --> 36:12.295
it's not for everyone.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.297
Well, tell that to the women of this town.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.716
They don't seem to mind your occupation.

36:16.757 --> 36:18.843
[chuckles]

36:18.885 --> 36:20.720
I'm sure that was a really difficult time.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.015
Well, my father always used to say

36:24.056 --> 36:27.143
that the only way to truly get over a broken heart

36:27.184 --> 36:29.103
is to find love again.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.229
So what you're saying is,

36:30.271 --> 36:33.441
it's going to be a while before I finish my book?

36:33.482 --> 36:34.901
[chuckles]

36:42.825 --> 36:44.285
[knocks]

36:46.412 --> 36:47.371
Cynthia.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.456
Hi!

36:48.497 --> 36:49.332
Hi.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.542
I, um, wanted to thank you again

36:51.584 --> 36:52.460
for the azalea.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.085
Oh, it's the least that we could do,

36:54.086 --> 36:56.589
and by "we," I mean Barnabas.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.798
[laughs]

36:57.840 --> 37:00.468
And I picked up something for Dooley...

37:00.509 --> 37:02.678
some books that I thought he might like.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.096
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.431
Thank you!

37:06.432 --> 37:07.683
Russell's going to drop him over here

37:07.725 --> 37:09.143
in a little bit.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.021
I was thinking we could do something, but...

37:12.063 --> 37:13.898
Oh, yeah, I'd love to talk later,

37:13.940 --> 37:15.983
but right now, I've got company.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.027
Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.028
No, it's fine!

37:19.070 --> 37:20.071
Thank you for thinking of Dooley.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.656
Yeah.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.240
Bye.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.496
Hi!

37:28.537 --> 37:29.955
Hi!

37:29.956 --> 37:31.623
How are you feeling?

37:31.624 --> 37:33.167
Oh, all right.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.793
Hal and I have been to the hospital

37:34.794 --> 37:36.045
three times now.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.422
Braxton Hicks.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.966
Oh, how did Dooley like the books?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.009
I don't know yet.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.095
I gave them to Tim. Dooley wasn't there yet.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.137
Tim had company, so we didn't really talk.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.138
A very pretty woman.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.432
Well, who was she?

37:48.474 --> 37:50.810
I don't know. I've never seen her before,

37:50.851 --> 37:52.019
but he can have a woman over

37:52.061 --> 37:54.146
without us prying into his business.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.691
Right, of course, but he didn't introduce you?

37:56.732 --> 37:57.858
That's odd.

37:57.900 --> 37:58.943
That's what I thought.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.486
Not that it bothered me,

38:00.528 --> 38:02.780
but, you know, normally, when someone is there

38:02.822 --> 38:03.739
and someone else walks up...

38:03.781 --> 38:06.492
Right, that's strange.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.910
Well, it doesn't matter. It's none of our business.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.495
Right, none of our business...

38:11.497 --> 38:13.833
but I'll find out who she is, anyway.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.293
[laughing]

38:17.795 --> 38:19.297
That is so strange!

38:19.338 --> 38:21.841
The flyers are all gone.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.177
Hmm. That is weird.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.013
Come on, Barnabas! Let's go!

38:28.264 --> 38:32.768
Or maybe they didn't just disappear after all.

38:35.396 --> 38:38.023
I've been wanting to read these.

38:38.024 --> 38:38.983
You should probably thank Cynthia.

38:39.025 --> 38:41.736
Is she your girlfriend?

38:42.945 --> 38:44.989
No, she's my neighbor.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.115
Why do you ask?

38:46.157 --> 38:48.200
'Cause when I'm friends with a girl,

38:48.242 --> 38:50.161
that's what grown-ups ask me.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.746
[laughs]

38:51.787 --> 38:54.290
Fair enough, but no.

38:54.331 --> 38:55.499
She's just a friend.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.418
Mm.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.924
Hello, Barnabas! Hello, buddy.

39:07.344 --> 39:08.304
Ah, there you are!

39:08.346 --> 39:10.056
Good morning!

39:10.931 --> 39:12.725
What do you have there?

39:12.767 --> 39:14.435
Just try it.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.445
Mm...

39:25.404 --> 39:27.072
A caramel macchiato!

39:27.073 --> 39:29.574
I have been staring at a blank piece of paper

39:29.575 --> 39:30.659
all morning.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.244
This is just what I need to get some words written.

39:33.245 --> 39:34.246
Where did you get it?

39:34.288 --> 39:35.289
I made it.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.791
I bought an espresso machine for my dad,

39:36.832 --> 39:37.792
but he's a purist.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.627
Plain old black coffee guy.

39:39.668 --> 39:40.503
Boring.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.920
Yeah, I know, so basically,

39:41.921 --> 39:43.755
it's now for me when I'm here.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.466
You know what they say...

39:45.508 --> 39:47.093
you can take the boy away from the city,

39:47.134 --> 39:49.845
but you can't take the macchiato away from the boy.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.472
I'm indebted to you.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.264
I like to see you smile.

39:53.265 --> 39:54.766
Now...

39:54.767 --> 39:57.144
show me this house I'm going to sell for you.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.943
So...

40:04.944 --> 40:05.944
what do you think?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.738
It's perfection.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.823
Really?

40:08.864 --> 40:10.366
You're not going to give me a whole to-do list

40:10.407 --> 40:11.742
to get the house ready to sell?

40:11.784 --> 40:13.119
No, no, it's fine.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.120
You know, people just look at a house

40:14.121 --> 40:15.121
for its bones.

40:15.122 --> 40:16.122
Most want to gut it, renovate it,

40:16.163 --> 40:17.248
and make it their own.

40:17.289 --> 40:18.207
Gut it?

40:18.249 --> 40:20.125
Yeah, for the most part.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.293
Might want to clean up that garden, though.

40:21.335 --> 40:22.294
It's a good selling point.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.337
I know just the right guy.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.629
I want this transaction

40:24.630 --> 40:25.881
to be perfect and effortless for you.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.384
I know this was your uncle's house,

40:28.425 --> 40:30.010
and I know what it meant to him,

40:30.052 --> 40:31.470
so let's do right by him.

40:32.972 --> 40:33.764
Thank you.

40:33.806 --> 40:34.973
[sneezes]

40:34.974 --> 40:35.975
Oh, God bless!

40:36.016 --> 40:36.934
[sneezes]

40:36.976 --> 40:37.977
And again, and again.

40:38.018 --> 40:38.978
[sneezes]

40:38.979 --> 40:40.020
Are you okay?

40:40.062 --> 40:41.980
I'm sorry. I was fine when I came in.

40:41.981 --> 40:42.981
Do you have a pet?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.149
Yes...

40:44.150 --> 40:45.316
Oh, Jack, I didn't know you had allergies.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.318
You have a cat?

40:46.360 --> 40:47.278
Oh, dear.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.279
Is this going to be a problem

40:48.320 --> 40:49.320
for selling the house?

40:49.321 --> 40:50.364
No, no...

40:50.406 --> 40:52.991
I will take an antihistamine, but right now...

40:52.992 --> 40:53.993
right now, I have to go.

40:54.034 --> 40:54.994
Okay.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.871
[sneezes]

40:58.247 --> 40:59.206
Jack?

40:59.248 --> 41:00.166
Tim.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.168
-Allergies.
-Cats.

41:02.209 --> 41:03.169
Oh, that's too bad.

41:03.170 --> 41:04.837
We'll put you on the prayer chain.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.130
Oh, no, I'm... oh, it's okay. I'm fine, thanks.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.133
Well, the garden at the church is bursting with these,

41:09.175 --> 41:10.384
and I thought you might like them.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.344
Wow, they are beautiful. Aren't they, Jack?

41:13.345 --> 41:15.556
Yeah, beautiful.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.057
Listen, I'm sorry, I was going to take you to lunch,

41:17.099 --> 41:18.184
but I've got to go.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.018
Oh, no, that's okay. We'll do it another time.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.103
You take care of yourself.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.688
Sure.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.523
I love cats.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.485
Careful!

41:32.907 --> 41:33.949
Thank you.

41:33.991 --> 41:34.992
That's so sweet.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.285
That's so kind of you to come over here.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.329
Traffic was okay?

41:38.370 --> 41:39.830
I'll see you at the church.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.378
Busy at your place.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.297
Looks like a three-casserole day.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.381
[laughs]

41:49.423 --> 41:50.925
You checking up on me?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.635
Some things are hard to miss.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.387
You need a tuna casserole? Because I've got, like, seven.

41:55.429 --> 41:57.848
[laughing]

41:57.890 --> 41:58.849
I didn't know you paint.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.392
Yeah.

42:00.434 --> 42:02.894
I do all my illustrations.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.356
I felt, since the words weren't coming,

42:05.397 --> 42:06.982
I would start this way

42:07.024 --> 42:09.735
and... see what happens.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.655
Well, your blending technique is so beautiful.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.575
Am I being annoying right now,

42:16.617 --> 42:17.743
watching you paint over your shoulder?

42:17.785 --> 42:19.161
Not at all.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.330
You're a woman of many talents.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.747
Well, unfortunately,

42:22.748 --> 42:24.041
some of them are sleeping right now.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.085
I could help you bounce around some ideas, if you want.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.337
That's the problem.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.130
I, uh...

42:30.172 --> 42:32.341
don't know where to begin.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.176
It's like he left and, uh...

42:34.218 --> 42:35.803
took my creativity with him.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.264
He isn't what made you a good writer.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.600
You can write just as well with or without him.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.645
You are a smart, kind, talented woman,

42:44.687 --> 42:47.356
and whether he's there or not, that doesn't change any of that.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.441
Thank you, Father Tim.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.277
You can just call me Tim...

42:52.778 --> 42:54.530
and now,

42:54.572 --> 42:57.449
in a strange role reversal kind of way,

42:57.491 --> 42:59.368
I'd love to get your advice on something.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.704
Sure. Anything.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.121
Great, come with me. I'll drive.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.039
Where to?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.624
The church.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.959
Okay... but we're walking,

43:07.001 --> 43:08.961
because I'm not getting on that scooter thing.

43:09.003 --> 43:10.045
[laughs]

43:12.590 --> 43:13.507
And originally,

43:13.549 --> 43:14.466
it was just that front part there,

43:14.508 --> 43:16.302
just the white, the chapel,

43:16.343 --> 43:17.594
and over the years, we just sort of added on...

43:17.636 --> 43:18.804
[car honks horn]

43:18.846 --> 43:19.888
Hey!

43:22.141 --> 43:23.142
Hey, you two.

43:23.183 --> 43:24.101
Hello!

43:24.143 --> 43:25.269
Hi there!

43:25.311 --> 43:27.271
Nice day for a little walk.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.897
Well, it wasn't so much a walk

43:28.939 --> 43:31.150
as it was a rejection of a scooter.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.317
Well, you've seen him drive.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.444
Everyone has seen him drive.

43:33.485 --> 43:34.570
[laughs]

43:34.612 --> 43:35.820
I'm so glad I ran into you both.

43:35.821 --> 43:37.948
Hal and I want to have everyone over to the farm

43:37.990 --> 43:38.949
for Labor Day,

43:38.991 --> 43:40.909
one final summer picnic

43:40.951 --> 43:43.161
before the real labor day descends upon us.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.121
Sounds like fun.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.163
I think Russell's got to work,

43:45.164 --> 43:46.332
but Dooley and I will be there.

43:46.373 --> 43:47.665
And I can bring macaroni and cheese and bacon.

43:47.666 --> 43:49.918
Ugh, I'm so over that.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.628
Just ice cream, 24-7.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.171
Got it. That's easy.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.131
With chocolate sauce.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.007
And sprinkles? You got that?

43:55.049 --> 43:56.008
Yeah!

43:56.050 --> 43:57.801
Okay! We'll see you then.

43:57.843 --> 43:58.552
Okay!

43:58.594 --> 43:59.553
Drive safe.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.221
Thanks. Take care, you two.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.723
[car door shuts]

44:09.229 --> 44:10.230
The original pastor of this church

44:10.272 --> 44:11.774
painted both of these.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.233
They're actually over a hundred years old,

44:13.275 --> 44:14.943
and I've been wanting to restore them

44:14.985 --> 44:15.944
for some time now,

44:15.986 --> 44:17.404
but I wanted to make sure I did it right.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.615
They're incredible, Tim.

44:19.657 --> 44:22.117
So what do you think it'll take?

44:22.159 --> 44:24.119
A conservation varnish over the original artwork

44:24.161 --> 44:25.120
will protect it,

44:25.162 --> 44:26.121
but then you need to come in

44:26.163 --> 44:28.791
and delicately paint over it.

44:28.832 --> 44:29.833
Hmm.

44:29.875 --> 44:31.043
So I guess any old guy could do it then, right?

44:31.085 --> 44:31.960
Sure.

44:32.002 --> 44:32.961
Yeah.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.004
I can do it.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.047
You, no...

44:35.089 --> 44:36.673
I can't ask that of you! You've got your book.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.634
No, I want to.

44:38.675 --> 44:40.010
It's good to give back,

44:40.052 --> 44:41.929
and my right brain could use the distraction.

44:41.970 --> 44:45.223
I'll paint all day and write all night.

44:45.224 --> 44:46.392
Well...

44:46.433 --> 44:48.226
that does sound like the perfect balance.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.353
I mean, we could pay you a little bit.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.146
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.607
I want to do it, for Mitford.

44:53.649 --> 44:54.858
Father Tim!

44:54.900 --> 44:57.778
Here's the altar arrangement for Sunday.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.404
I added lilies, your favorite.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.572
Very nice, Sally.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.615
Cynthia has offered

45:01.657 --> 45:02.533
to restore our paintings.

45:02.574 --> 45:03.534
Isn't that great?

45:03.575 --> 45:04.493
Great.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.162
Um... it is Episcopalian art, though.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.579
Might not be her specialty?

45:08.580 --> 45:09.706
Are you Episcopalian?

45:09.748 --> 45:11.625
Actually, I am.

45:11.667 --> 45:12.668
I'm sure, even if she was Protestant,

45:12.710 --> 45:14.002
it would probably be fine,

45:14.044 --> 45:15.879
but it's a good thing that we don't have to convert you.

45:16.713 --> 45:17.756
Let me get some pictures

45:17.798 --> 45:19.091
so that I can color match the paints.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.134
Great.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.468
Aren't we lucky?

45:22.469 --> 45:23.470
So lucky.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.271
Oh, no...

45:32.312 --> 45:34.231
Yeah, absolutely.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.524
I will be right there.

45:35.566 --> 45:36.775
I'm on my way.

45:39.611 --> 45:42.156
Russell Jacks is at Dr. Harper's office.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.614
He's taken a really bad fall.

45:43.615 --> 45:44.615
Oh, well, let me come with you

45:44.616 --> 45:46.410
in case you need help with Dooley.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.411
Okay, thank you.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.498
We're waiting for the ambulance

45:51.540 --> 45:52.666
to take him to the hospital in Wesley.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.042
No, no, I can't go to Wesley.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.128
Somebody has to pick up Dooley from the neighbors, and...

45:57.129 --> 45:58.046
Russell?

45:58.088 --> 45:59.214
I can do all of that.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.426
You're going to be fine, Russell, and so is Dooley.

46:02.468 --> 46:03.927
I'm fine now.

46:03.969 --> 46:05.512
Doc, you just tell me where to sign,

46:05.554 --> 46:07.181
and I'll get out of your hair.

46:07.222 --> 46:08.140
I don't need surgery...

46:08.182 --> 46:09.391
Russell, you need surgery.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.642
But who's going to watch Dooley?

46:11.643 --> 46:13.311
You've been so good to him already.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.105
I can't ask you to take him in.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.316
You don't have to ask because I just offered.

46:17.357 --> 46:18.525
I don't know

46:18.567 --> 46:19.735
how I'll ever be able to thank you.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.362
You just focus on getting better.

46:22.404 --> 46:25.823
We'll take care of Dooley... together.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.534
You're going to be fine.

and now he's stuck with virtual strangers.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.693
Well, he has to eat.

I know.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.737
You know...

47:03.779 --> 47:06.531
I think I have an idea to cheer him up.

47:06.532 --> 47:07.533
I'll just have to run out...

Okay.

I'm going to leave the cake.

48:09.344 --> 48:11.221
All right, let's go, Barnabas.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.598
Wait, can he stay?

48:12.639 --> 48:14.808
He told me he wanted to have a sleep over.

48:14.850 --> 48:17.269
I forgot to tell you,

48:17.311 --> 48:18.937
I speak dog now, too.

48:19.730 --> 48:20.731
Okay, then.

48:20.772 --> 48:21.690
Good night, Dooley.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.442
Night, Ms. Coppersmith.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.404
Good night, you two.

48:34.953 --> 48:36.788
Thank you for helping out with Dooley.

48:36.830 --> 48:39.123
I think he's really starting to open up.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.124
Well,

48:40.125 --> 48:42.294
he doesn't know where he belongs right now.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.754
I can relate.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.047
I know where you belong...

48:46.048 --> 48:47.632
in front of a computer, writing your book.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.051
[laughs]

48:49.092 --> 48:51.970
Well, I did get a title. It's a start.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.180
What? You didn't tell me that.

48:53.221 --> 48:54.723
That's big progress.

48:54.765 --> 48:55.932
Yeah, I got it last night,

48:55.974 --> 48:57.184
you know, before all this stuff with Dooley.

48:57.225 --> 48:59.102
And are you going to share it?

48:59.144 --> 49:01.730
Because you know, I happen to be a big fan of Violet's.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.107
Um... not yet.

49:04.149 --> 49:05.483
Aw, you're going to make me wait?

49:05.484 --> 49:06.443
Yes.

49:09.321 --> 49:10.321
Well...

49:10.322 --> 49:11.406
good night, Tim.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.201
Good night, Cynthia.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.136
[phone rings]

49:36.682 --> 49:37.682
Hello, James.

49:37.683 --> 49:38.850
Tell me you're almost done.

49:38.892 --> 49:40.017
I need those pages,

49:40.018 --> 49:41.519
and I needed them yesterday, Cynthia.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.854
I still have time.

49:42.896 --> 49:44.523
Yeah, but it's getting shorter.

49:44.564 --> 49:45.690
I'm making progress...

49:45.691 --> 49:47.024
a little.

49:47.025 --> 49:48.527
Look, I don't mean to put added pressure on you,

49:48.568 --> 49:50.779
but if you miss this deadline, they're going to drop you.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.698
No more Violet the Cat.

49:52.739 --> 49:53.865
The publisher's breathing down my neck,

49:53.907 --> 49:55.784
and I can only protect you for so long.

49:55.826 --> 49:56.994
I know, James.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.869
I'll get it done.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.539
All right.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.167
[meows]

50:04.209 --> 50:06.253
Don't you listen to him, Violet.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.299
Can I please have a bottle of fizzy water?

50:11.341 --> 50:13.010
Sure.

50:13.051 --> 50:14.302
You sleep all right?

50:14.344 --> 50:15.386
Yep.

50:15.387 --> 50:16.346
Could you open it for me?

50:16.388 --> 50:17.347
Absolutely.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.559
Hey!

50:20.600 --> 50:22.018
Ha ha, gotcha!

50:22.060 --> 50:23.227
Come on, Barnabas!

50:23.228 --> 50:24.563
Let's go.

50:24.604 --> 50:25.896
Nice one, Dooley.

50:25.897 --> 50:29.401
And there was club soda literally all over my shirt.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.987
What I'm wearing is the second shirt of the day.

50:32.028 --> 50:34.406
Well, you have to admit, it's a pretty clever trick.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.323
Where is he?

50:35.365 --> 50:36.992
I want to tell him I'm impressed.

50:37.034 --> 50:39.453
He's helping Sally in the office.

50:39.494 --> 50:40.662
Man, Russell warned me.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.997
He said he could be a little prankster.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.874
Well, you know, you're going to have to get him back.

50:43.915 --> 50:45.792
I don't know any pranks.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.711
I might be able to help you with that.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.713
You know some pranks?

50:49.755 --> 50:51.840
Are there any limits to your talents?

50:51.882 --> 50:53.842
No. They're infinite.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.052
[chuckles]

50:56.136 --> 50:59.181
Well, these are coming along so nicely.

50:59.222 --> 51:00.390
Yeah, and I'll be able to finish

51:00.432 --> 51:01.475
before I leave.

51:02.517 --> 51:03.934
And when is that, exactly?

51:03.935 --> 51:05.562
Well, when I sell the house...

51:05.604 --> 51:07.230
but first things first.

51:07.272 --> 51:09.149
I have got to get that garden together.

51:09.191 --> 51:12.360
Yeah, and write a book sometime in there.

51:12.402 --> 51:14.070
Yeah, that too...

51:15.030 --> 51:16.490
but you know,

51:16.531 --> 51:18.533
this has been very meditative.

51:18.575 --> 51:19.493
It's helped.

51:19.534 --> 51:21.036
I've always found them very powerful.

51:21.077 --> 51:21.995
Makes me remember

51:22.037 --> 51:25.290
why I decided to become a priest.

51:25.332 --> 51:26.917
Why is that?

51:26.958 --> 51:29.294
I lost my father when I was a kid,

51:29.336 --> 51:31.755
and I became very shut down,

51:31.797 --> 51:33.757
and it was this place, this church,

51:33.799 --> 51:35.217
that brought me back.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.551
Everyone here rallied around me.

51:36.593 --> 51:40.931
My mother and I realized that family isn't only blood.

51:40.972 --> 51:44.308
It's community. It's congregation,

51:44.309 --> 51:45.936
and I knew that I needed to be that for people,

51:45.977 --> 51:48.647
the same way that they saved me.

51:49.898 --> 51:51.149
Just like what you're doing for Dooley.

51:51.191 --> 51:53.026
Something like that, yeah.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.152
In this life,

51:54.194 --> 51:55.362
we're always searching for where we belong,

51:55.403 --> 51:58.031
but one day, it became very clear to me,

51:58.073 --> 52:01.201
that I belonged up there, on that altar,

52:01.243 --> 52:03.787
boring people to tears every Sunday.

52:03.829 --> 52:05.372
I am sure you're not that boring.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.331
Oh, I am.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.959
Well, we'll just have to see about that.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.210
Yeah?

52:10.252 --> 52:12.002
So you'll come on Sunday?

52:12.003 --> 52:13.088
Yeah.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.756
And you will stay awake?

52:14.798 --> 52:16.383
Well, no promises there.

52:16.424 --> 52:17.634
I'll take it.

52:18.718 --> 52:19.678
[phone rings]

52:19.719 --> 52:20.720
Oh...

52:23.765 --> 52:25.392
Sorry.

52:25.433 --> 52:27.269
No, go ahead.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.689
Hi, Jack!

52:30.730 --> 52:32.816
Yeah, yeah, I can talk.

52:32.858 --> 52:35.610
I'm fine. How are you?

52:43.159 --> 52:45.536
Why did you have me change my shirt?

52:45.537 --> 52:47.038
The other one was fine.

52:47.080 --> 52:48.290
Thought you'd want to look nice.

52:48.331 --> 52:49.540
Why?

52:49.541 --> 52:50.959
For dinner. I made it...

52:51.001 --> 52:52.460
sort of.

52:52.502 --> 52:54.545
I heated up some stuff from one of the church women.

52:54.546 --> 52:57.465
It smells good.

52:57.507 --> 52:58.800
Oh, by the way,

52:58.842 --> 53:00.594
Mrs. Coppersmith is coming over for dinner.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.432
How did that happen?

53:05.473 --> 53:06.224
You invited her.

53:06.225 --> 53:08.476
Look at your texts.

53:09.728 --> 53:11.730
But I didn't send this text.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.067
That's weird.

53:16.109 --> 53:17.902
Your phone sure says you did.

53:17.903 --> 53:19.529
[doorbell rings]

53:19.571 --> 53:20.905
You should get that.

53:20.906 --> 53:23.074
It's your guest.

53:23.116 --> 53:24.868
Don't worry about me. I already ate.

53:24.910 --> 53:27.412
Oh, casserole's in the microwave.

53:29.664 --> 53:30.582
Hi.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.959
It seems we've been set up.

53:35.128 --> 53:38.548
This is nice.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.424
Thank you, Dooley.

53:40.425 --> 53:42.802
You're welcome.

53:42.844 --> 53:45.639
Everyone's a matchmaker around here.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.598
Well, I am sure

53:46.599 --> 53:48.391
there are no shortage of women in town

53:48.433 --> 53:50.310
who are happily vying for the title

53:50.352 --> 53:52.770
of Mrs. Father Tim Kavanaugh.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.314
But like I said,

53:54.356 --> 53:56.483
she's not in Mitford.

53:56.524 --> 53:59.444
You're telling me there isn't one woman

53:59.486 --> 54:02.781
who has remotely piqued your interest?

54:02.822 --> 54:04.448
Well, there's a certain... thing,

54:04.449 --> 54:07.702
and I felt it once, with my ex-fiancée,

54:07.744 --> 54:09.371
and that is the criteria,

54:09.412 --> 54:11.414
and you can't settle for less.

54:11.456 --> 54:12.165
Yeah.

54:12.207 --> 54:13.959
I know that feeling...

54:15.418 --> 54:16.460
and once you've had it,

54:16.461 --> 54:19.798
you just can't lower your standards.

54:19.839 --> 54:20.924
It makes everything harder.

54:20.966 --> 54:21.925
Yes, it does.

54:23.635 --> 54:25.387
Is that what you're looking for with Jack?

54:25.428 --> 54:26.471
Oh, no.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.223
I don't mean to pry. It's none of my business.

54:28.264 --> 54:29.933
Oh, no, he's selling my uncle's house,

54:29.975 --> 54:31.309
and he's friendly.

54:31.351 --> 54:32.644
He makes a great cup of coffee...

54:32.686 --> 54:33.728
[chuckles]

54:33.770 --> 54:35.730
But that's... that's all.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.150
I mean...

54:39.192 --> 54:41.819
how can I start a relationship here

54:41.820 --> 54:44.823
when I'm going to be leaving so soon?

54:44.864 --> 54:47.951
You're right. Wouldn't make any sense.

54:53.581 --> 54:56.333
And a couple more things before we go.

54:56.334 --> 54:59.629
Russell Jacks, unfortunately, is still in the hospital,

54:59.671 --> 55:02.716
so please add him to your prayer chains, okay?

55:02.757 --> 55:03.841
And on a happier note,

55:03.842 --> 55:06.136
Mrs. Sloane is feeling a whole lot better.

55:06.177 --> 55:07.345
She thanks the entire congregation

55:07.387 --> 55:09.681
for the flowers, for the good thoughts.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.349
Clearly, your prayers are making a difference,

55:11.391 --> 55:13.727
so keep it up, everyone...

55:13.768 --> 55:16.353
and I'd also like to thank Ms. Cynthia Coppersmith

55:16.354 --> 55:17.939
for taking the time

55:17.981 --> 55:21.525
to restore our treasured paintings.

55:21.526 --> 55:23.153
Means so much to everyone here. Thank you so much, Cynthia.

55:23.194 --> 55:25.822
[congregation applauds]

55:28.825 --> 55:30.534
Really?

55:30.535 --> 55:32.787
Okay.

55:32.829 --> 55:35.540
[laughs]

55:35.582 --> 55:36.791
Whoo!

55:36.833 --> 55:38.793
Ah...

55:38.835 --> 55:40.295
[exhales]That was great!

55:40.336 --> 55:41.879
That's not your first time, is it?

55:41.880 --> 55:43.882
No, good job!

55:43.923 --> 55:45.133
Whoo!

55:45.175 --> 55:47.594
And...

55:47.635 --> 55:48.553
Oh, no way.

55:48.595 --> 55:50.347
You have got to be kidding me.

55:50.388 --> 55:51.723
Your caramel macchiato.

55:51.765 --> 55:52.682
Again!

55:52.724 --> 55:54.434
How am I ever going to repay you?

55:54.476 --> 55:56.227
No repayment necessary.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.771
I care about my clients.

55:59.814 --> 56:00.815
I care about you.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.362
Listen, I've got to show that building on Main,

56:06.404 --> 56:07.989
but just to recap the plan,

56:08.031 --> 56:09.741
we've got azaleas in the back,

56:09.783 --> 56:13.870
roses around the edges.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.080
Peonies and delphiniums are, uh...

56:16.081 --> 56:17.248
In the center.

56:17.290 --> 56:18.415
Oh, right.

56:18.416 --> 56:21.044
And then we will have restored my uncle's garden

56:21.086 --> 56:22.419
to its former glory.

56:22.420 --> 56:24.589
Well, I'll get my guy on it right away.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.090
You know, I already have a young couple from Wesley

56:26.091 --> 56:27.091
interested in looking at it.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.092
Already?

56:28.093 --> 56:29.177
Mm-hmm.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.929
I don't think I'm ready.

56:30.970 --> 56:31.971
I've got your back, Cynthia.

56:32.013 --> 56:33.348
I promise...

56:33.389 --> 56:35.683
I will take care of you.

56:40.939 --> 56:42.607
[car engine starts]

56:46.277 --> 56:47.737
-Jack.
-Tim.

56:50.990 --> 56:51.950
What are you drinking?

56:51.951 --> 56:53.951
A caramel macchiato.

56:53.952 --> 56:55.245
Is that English?

56:55.286 --> 56:57.455
It's Italian.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.165
When did coffee get so fancy?

56:59.207 --> 57:01.668
When they started charging $6.00 for it.

57:01.709 --> 57:03.336
Yeah.

57:03.378 --> 57:05.338
Hey, we came up with a master plan

57:05.380 --> 57:07.215
to restore my uncle's garden.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.216
Great.

57:08.258 --> 57:09.217
Show me?

57:09.259 --> 57:11.553
Sure!

57:12.762 --> 57:15.431
And then, roses around the perimeter.

57:15.473 --> 57:16.891
Frank would've loved that.

57:16.933 --> 57:18.685
I can help you prep it.

57:18.726 --> 57:20.520
Well, thank you.

57:20.562 --> 57:22.564
I really want to do right by him.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.023
He encouraged my writing.

57:24.065 --> 57:27.193
I wrote my first book in the garden.

57:27.235 --> 57:29.904
It was called "The Unicorn Princess."

57:29.946 --> 57:31.321
It was about a lost butterfly.

57:31.322 --> 57:34.576
Clearly, my narrative skills have improved with time.

57:34.617 --> 57:36.619
But you haven't been back much over the years.

57:36.661 --> 57:38.288
He came to all my book signings.

57:38.329 --> 57:40.290
Always in the front row.

57:40.331 --> 57:41.374
It's not every day

57:41.416 --> 57:43.001
you get a best-selling author in the family.

57:43.042 --> 57:44.002
They weren't always.

57:44.003 --> 57:46.087
My first two weren't successful,

57:46.129 --> 57:48.256
and then I gave Violet magical powers

57:48.298 --> 57:50.175
to help children solve their problems,

57:50.216 --> 57:52.260
and... everything clicked.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.637
If only we all had a magical cat.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.931
Right.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.976
My marriage was struggling,

58:00.018 --> 58:01.936
and I didn't know how to fix it.

58:03.521 --> 58:04.689
So you gave Violet the power

58:04.731 --> 58:06.774
to fix problems that you couldn't.

58:06.816 --> 58:08.525
Something like that,

58:08.526 --> 58:11.112
but now, everything has to be a best seller.

58:12.572 --> 58:15.408
You can't please all the people all the time.

58:15.450 --> 58:17.535
You've got to write what speaks to you

58:17.577 --> 58:20.079
because that's when your voice is the most powerful.

58:20.121 --> 58:21.456
At least, that's what I hope for

58:21.498 --> 58:23.041
when I write my sermons.

58:23.082 --> 58:24.208
Well, it's working

58:24.209 --> 58:25.919
because you're very well-received.

58:25.960 --> 58:27.544
As are your books.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.255
We just write what moves us,

58:29.297 --> 58:31.633
and hopefully, our passion comes through for others.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.176
Passion.

58:33.218 --> 58:34.427
That's what I'm missing.

58:34.469 --> 58:37.055
I think I've lost my passion.

58:37.096 --> 58:38.389
Well, we all do from time to time,

58:38.431 --> 58:40.308
but you can get it back.

58:40.350 --> 58:41.893
[car approaches]

58:43.478 --> 58:44.729
I didn't realize what time it is.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.064
I'm... I'm sorry, I've got a...

58:46.105 --> 58:48.775
No, go ahead. It's fine.

58:48.816 --> 58:50.068
Okay. See you.

58:50.109 --> 58:51.611
Nice talking to you.

59:00.578 --> 59:02.330
Good morning, Dooley.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.413
Hi.

59:03.414 --> 59:04.791
Got your cereal there on the counter.

59:04.832 --> 59:06.084
Help yourself.

59:06.125 --> 59:08.002
Thank you.

59:11.923 --> 59:12.757
[laughs]

59:12.799 --> 59:13.841
I gotcha!

59:17.762 --> 59:18.888
And it was frozen!

59:18.930 --> 59:20.598
The whole bowl.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.350
Wow, you really stepped up your game.

59:22.392 --> 59:23.309
I'm impressed.

59:23.351 --> 59:24.352
Thank you.

59:24.394 --> 59:25.353
I mean, I can't take all the credit

59:25.395 --> 59:26.312
because I found it online,

59:26.354 --> 59:27.563
but I got him good.

59:28.606 --> 59:30.858
Dooley, are you excited to see your grandpa?

59:30.900 --> 59:31.776
Yeah.

59:31.777 --> 59:33.194
I mean, I love being with Barnabas,

59:33.236 --> 59:35.405
but I miss my grandpa.

59:35.446 --> 59:37.448
I know everything feels upside-down,

59:37.490 --> 59:39.117
but that's just for now.

59:39.158 --> 59:40.743
Yeah, you'll be together in no time.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.122
Nope, he can't see him.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.165
No exceptions.

59:46.207 --> 59:48.793
You need to be 12to come into this unit.

59:48.835 --> 59:50.003
Sorry.

59:50.044 --> 59:51.129
I don't make the rules, but I have to follow them.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.173
But it's his grandfather.

59:54.215 --> 59:55.550
It's his only family.

59:55.592 --> 59:56.551
See, the thing is,

59:56.592 --> 59:58.303
his parents are away in the military.

59:58.344 --> 01:00:00.597
You can't bend the rules just a little bit?

01:00:00.638 --> 01:00:01.972
Sorry, Tim, but you tell him

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:05.226
that Russell is improving every single day.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.310
He'll be home soon.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:07.645
He even took a walk by himself

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.522
to the garden yesterday.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:12.108
So he can leave the unit.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.943
For a short period of time, yes.

01:00:16.362 --> 01:00:17.572
I have an idea.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.906
I'm right there with you.

01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:22.827
Dooley![laughs]

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.496
Thank you, Dr. Harper.

01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:27.749
I haven't seen him this happy in a while.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.000
Well, technically, we haven't broken any rules.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:29.834
I mean...

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.878
they are outside the hospital...

01:00:31.919 --> 01:00:33.254
and yeah, this'll do 'em both some good.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.630
Family always does.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.467
You guys'll have him back in 10, though, right?

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:39.052
You got it, doc.

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.720
Thanks.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:44.641
Yes, what else?

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:53.024
Thanks for taking me to see Grandpa.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.358
Can we do it again?

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.569
Sure we can.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.446
Good night, you two.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.239
No, you're staying right there.

01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:01.366
Good night.

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.076
Good night.

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.161
Good night, Barnabas.

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.549
This hat is way too small for me.

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:19.634
That's mine!

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.218
Oh! Really?

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.552
You have a big head.

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:25.722
Ha! That means I've got a big brain.

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:27.724
That jacket looks great on you.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:29.726
The women in this town are not going to know

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.604
what to do with this Dapper Dan.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:33.564
Hmm, well, thank you for helping me pick it out.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:35.400
I've been needing one for a while.

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:37.735
You look like a new man.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:42.031
[steady typing]

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.204
[pauses]

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.049
It's happening, Violet.

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:04.095
Your magic is helping someone else.

01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:20.069
Hello?

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:20.987
Hey!

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.071
Hey!

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.073
Wow...

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.116
What?

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.117
You look...

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.951
not like a priest.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:29.120
[chuckles]

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.038
Well, today, I'm a carpenter.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.416
Feel like I'm always fixing things around here.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.542
One time, in a sermon,

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.877
I hit the lectern so hard, that it broke.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:38.463
I bet you that woke up the people in the back pew.

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.590
Sadly... it did not.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:42.842
[chuckles]So, uh...

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.886
are you working here all day?

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.136
I am.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:48.514
I got a lot done this morning, so I'm all good.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:50.224
Oh, good.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.475
Great.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:52.935
Um...

01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:54.811
do you think maybe that you could lock up for me?

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:56.813
Because I've got an appointment that I need to get to.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.149
Sure, I can do that.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.233
Yeah?

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.943
I'll just leave the keys in the office, okay?

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:02.028
Okay.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.460
Hey, Hal!

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.212
Hey.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.171
Listen,

01:03:20.172 --> 01:03:22.798
thanks for letting me use it, man.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.175
Yeah, what's it for, anyway?

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:28.178
Oh, a surprise for Cynthia.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.305
You like this girl.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:30.973
Just trying to be a good neighbor.

01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:34.477
Thanks, Hal!

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:51.244
Jack!

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:53.829
Oh, my gosh!

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:56.415
This is incredible!

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:57.833
I knew you said you had a guy

01:03:57.875 --> 01:03:58.876
that was going to do this,

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.461
but I thought I would have to help!

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.756
What an unbelievable surprise.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:04.715
Oh, I didn't really, uh...

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:06.550
You got everything.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:09.303
How am I ever going to thank you?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.554
You don't have to thank me...

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.306
You know, this is better

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.057
than I could've ever imagined.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:15.017
Oh...

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:16.310
Tim!

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.520
Did you see what Jack did?

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.689
The garden's been transformed.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.606
What Jack did?

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.359
Yeah, well, I mean... Tim helped.

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:24.568
You did?

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:25.611
Oh...

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:28.572
Tim, that is so sweet.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.867
Thank you so much.

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.827
This is the kindest thing

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.871
that anyone has ever done for me.

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:36.831
That's very kind.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.416
I mean, I want to give Tim credit

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:39.417
where credit is due.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:40.418
No, no, no.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:41.711
No, thank you,

01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:45.131
but you really seem to have it under control,

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.133
so I will, um...

01:04:47.174 --> 01:04:48.551
I'll let you finish.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:53.723
And I'm more than happy to help you.

01:04:53.764 --> 01:04:54.764
Oh!

01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:56.809
Yeah. Thank you, Jack Emery. Gosh.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.061
I have the most beautiful garden in Mitford!

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.613
[sighs in satisfaction]

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.074
I'm done, Violet...

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:23.961
and if I may toot my own horn,

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.464
it's pretty darn good.

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.469
[knocking]

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.387
Coming!

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:38.017
Hey!

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:40.143
Please tell me you're awake.

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:40.978
I was awake,

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.896
and nothing is waking Dooley up.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.146
Come on in.

01:05:43.147 --> 01:05:43.898
I have news,

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.482
and I wanted to tell you first.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.943
An honor I do not take lightly.

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:49.236
I finished my book,

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.655
and I did it for me and nobody else but me...

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.199
oh, and Dooley.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.158
You'll see.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.077
This does call for a celebration.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.161
Come on.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.662
It's just sparkling apple juice,

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.915
in case Dooley was awake.

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:03.084
Oh, well, I'll save him some.

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.670
Tim...

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.839
I just wanted to say thank you...

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.926
for being such a good friend...

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.511
since I've been here.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.931
A friend. Yeah...

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:19.100
because that's what friends do.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:24.521
To honoring your own voice.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:26.023
[glasses clinking]

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:35.700
Well, the sign is up.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.617
So soon?

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.077
Well, you finished your book.

01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:39.662
Isn't that what you were waiting for?

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:41.288
I guess.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.541
Hey, I'm doing a deal in Boston.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:45.875
I'm going to be there in two weeks.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:46.836
This isn't the end.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:47.877
I just had to put the sign up now

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:48.879
because I've got a conference call

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:49.839
in an hour,

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.840
but I'll see you later?

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.549
Oh, I can't.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.759
I'm going to the Labor Day party

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.051
at Hal and Marge's.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:56.971
Okay, then I'll have to show the house without you.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.681
Show the house?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:06:59.724
It's not listed.

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:01.725
Okay, so maybe I went ahead and listed it,

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:03.644
but just to get a jump on the market,

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.645
and I told everyone we wouldn't show it

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.647
until you're ready, all right?

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.900
Okay. I'll leave you the key.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.318
All right.

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:27.626
Hi!

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:28.918
Hi!

01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:30.004
There are the jeans.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:31.047
Well, you said it was a picnic,

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:33.257
so I wore my picnic clothes.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.634
-This place is beautiful!
-Isn't it?

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:36.969
I'll show you around.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.054
Sure. Thank you.

01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:42.725
Oh, hey, Tim,

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:43.933
I found out

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:45.978
that Barnabas's owner was an old man in Blackstock

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.104
who passed away.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.981
Oh! That's too bad.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:51.901
Does that mean Barnabas is ours...

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:54.278
I mean... yours for good?

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.238
I guess it does, and he is ours.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.782
You come by and you play with him

01:07:57.823 --> 01:08:00.242
any time you want, okay?

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.624
Hey.

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:12.171
I...

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:13.630
I took down those posters

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.841
to find Barnabas's owner.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.511
I just... I didn't want him to leave.

01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:20.220
Hmm.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:23.890
You know, um,

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:29.020
telling the truth takes a lot of courage,

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.606
and a boy with courage

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:35.653
grows up to be a man with courage.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.154
Come on.

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:40.950
This is the tire swing that I grew up with.

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.785
We brought it over from...

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.787
You have horses?

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:45.746
Yep.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:46.997
You can ride one if you want.

01:08:47.038 --> 01:08:48.957
Joker's pretty tame.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.042
I don't know how.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.001
I can teach you.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.502
You ride?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.587
Yeah.

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:54.671
I've got to keep a running list

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:55.881
of all your hidden talents.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:56.756
I just can't keep up.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.135
Come on, let's go ride.

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:07.100
You know, Dooley, riding a horse

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.187
is about building a bond of trust,

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.022
just like you have with Barnabas.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.774
[Marge hums]

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.861
She's great with Dooley.

01:09:16.902 --> 01:09:18.862
Oh, yeah.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.072
She's great with everyone.

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:22.241
Grab hold of the horn.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:23.742
There you go. Foot in there.

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:25.870
You got it.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.497
Sure are going to miss her around here.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:29.582
Yeah.

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:31.000
Hold this,

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:32.960
just like you're holding an ice-cream cone.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.087
Now, I'm not going to let you fall,

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:38.799
but if you do fall, I'll catch you...

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.968
because that's what family does.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.720
-Good job.
-Thanks.

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:44.720
How's that feel, Dooley?

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:47.057
Who's going to catch you when you fall?

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:48.892
Oh, honey...

01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:49.894
he's already fallen.

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:55.065
You ready to try it by yourself?

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:56.984
You look great!

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:57.943
Come on.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:00.696
You got it! That was great!

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.741
Show us your belly. Come on.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.326
Where's the ball? Where's the ball?

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.452
Baked or mashed?

01:10:06.493 --> 01:10:08.077
I'm going to have baked for sure,

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:10.206
no doubt about it.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:16.378
Why don't you tell her?

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.921
I know you want her to stay.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:18.797
It doesn't matter.

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:21.133
She doesn't look at me that way.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.260
Big city woman settling in a small town

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.929
to become a pastor's wife?

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.139
That story has been told before,

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:29.183
and it didn't have a happy ending.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.435
You'll never know unless you give her a chance.

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:33.436
Take a leap.

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.273
It's what you're always telling us to do.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.030
Come on, come on!

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.324
Come on, everyone.

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:48.577
Bed time, Dooley.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:51.038
Thanks for teaching me how to ride today.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.623
Oh, you're welcome! You did great.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.501
All right.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.794
You go brush your teeth, okay?

01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:57.920
I'll be therein a second.

01:10:57.962 --> 01:10:59.004
Come on, Barnabas.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.464
I'm going to miss that kid.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:03.050
Aw, he's going to miss you, too.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.635
A lot of us are.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.388
Well, you've all become very special to me, too.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:09.640
I understand why my uncle didn't move away.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:10.724
It's hard to leave.

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:12.851
But you're still going to.

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:16.105
Well, Jack has a few offers on the house.

01:11:16.146 --> 01:11:17.523
I don't know.

01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:18.524
Cynthia...

01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:19.650
[phone rings]

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:20.985
I'm sorry.

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:23.279
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.530
Nah, it's not important. You go ahead, take the call.

01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:25.322
It can wait.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.116
I'll ask you another time.

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:28.117
Okay, I'll see you later.

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:29.326
Okay. All right.

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:33.288
Hi, Jack...

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:44.507
[phone rings]

01:11:44.508 --> 01:11:45.926
Hi, James.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.261
Cynthia Coppersmith,

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.929
it's the best thing you've ever written, hands down.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.765
Now, we have press and promotion to plan,

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:52.891
not to mention

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:54.768
they want four more Violet books after this one.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.103
That is incredible.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.146
It's almost like...

01:11:57.187 --> 01:11:58.439
you found your voice.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.232
It's unlike any of the others.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.025
I can't quite put my finger on it...

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.277
but you were right.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:04.820
The change of pace is just what you needed.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:06.071
Now, when are you coming home?

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.865
I want to sit down and craft a plan.

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:10.700
I'm not sure.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:11.869
Well, figure it out,

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.078
because Cynthia Coppersmith is back

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.203
and better than ever.

01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:16.498
Thanks, James.

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.134
Hi!

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.344
Hi!

01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:29.552
What do you have there?

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:30.345
Ice cream.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:31.930
We have to celebrate.

01:12:31.972 --> 01:12:33.890
My editor loved my book,

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.517
and they signed me for four more.

01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:37.102
I'm so happy for you. You deserve this.

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:38.895
And you deserve this ice cream.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.022
No, really, Tim,

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.483
I don't think I could've done it without you.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.942
Well, then I'll take that gratitude

01:12:43.984 --> 01:12:45.694
with chocolate sauce and sprinkles.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:46.945
Come on.

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.367
My uncle was wise to come to you for counsel.

01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:53.242
All your parishioners are.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:55.578
You have a gift.

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:57.664
Thank you.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.084
Is that what you are? A... a parishioner?

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:03.754
Well... that, and a friend.

01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:08.133
I wish I could repay you.

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.676
No need. That's the job I signed on for.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.223
I can't wait to read your book.

01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:15.933
Do you want to hear some?

01:13:15.974 --> 01:13:17.768
I would love that.

01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:21.437
"Young Dooley felt alone.

01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:25.150
His parents were away, his grandfather was ill,

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:28.195
and he wasn't sure where he belonged.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:32.115
Then in walked Violet, the magic cat,

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:34.409
and his whole life changed."

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:35.953
It's about Dooley.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:36.912
And you...

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.248
the kind priest who comes in

01:13:39.289 --> 01:13:40.833
and saves us all.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.253
Russell, Dooley...

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:47.047
Barnabas... me...

01:13:49.174 --> 01:13:50.217
but you'll have to wait until it's published

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.176
to read the rest.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.554
Well, I can't wait.

01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.306
So...

01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:00.185
how much longer for the paintings, you think?

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.478
I'll finish the last section today,

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:04.106
and then I'll be out of your hair.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:06.316
I'm sure it'll be a welcome change

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:07.568
to be rid of your nosy neighbor

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:10.112
watching all the comings and goings of your house.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.738
There aren't that many,

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.116
other than the occasional casserole being dropped off.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.909
Yeah, and the...

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.370
I don't know who she is. The...

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.788
your girlfriend.

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.374
Why would you think I had a girlfriend?

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.461
Well, the pretty, mysterious woman that comes by.

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:28.005
I've never seen her around town, so I just assumed.

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:29.631
Oh...

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:32.175
I can't really say too much about that.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.677
I don't mean to be evasive.

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:35.804
But she's not...

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.723
No, she's not.

01:14:42.102 --> 01:14:43.520
- Tim, uh...
- There you are!

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:44.687
I've been looking for you.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.148
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:47.316
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:50.235
I've been busy painting all morning.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:51.195
Tim.

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:52.695
Anyway, good news.

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:53.739
I've got a buyer for the house.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.449
We had multiple offers.
Over-asking.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.451
There's no way you can turn that down.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.369
This will truly honor your uncle's memory.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.039
So...[claps]

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.290
that's that.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.292
Yeah.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.252
That's that.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:13.967
Hey, Hal.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:14.885
Hey!

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:18.055
The patient is ready for his shots.

01:15:18.096 --> 01:15:19.389
There's my boy.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:20.849
There he is.

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:24.311
You know, I'm so glad he decided to adopt you.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.396
You two are a good pair.

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:28.565
I guess we are stuck with each other, hey, buddy?

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:31.318
Just you and me, Barnabas.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.694
Only you two?

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:34.738
Well, and Dooley, of course.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.198
No one else?

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:39.701
She sold her house, Hal.

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:41.370
She's going back to Boston.

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.371
And you're just going to let her.

01:15:42.412 --> 01:15:43.372
Let her?

01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:44.581
What am I supposed to do?

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:48.377
Well, for a start, you could tell her how you feel,

01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:49.752
ask her how she feels.

01:15:49.753 --> 01:15:52.464
She's told me how she feels several times.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:55.467
I'm a friend, and I've offered good counsel...

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.886
and like I said, this story has been told before.

01:15:57.928 --> 01:16:00.555
Well, then you need to rewrite the ending.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.560
Are you a vet or a therapist?

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:07.771
Well, you're not the only one around here

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.189
who gets to tell people what to do.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:15.444
Tim, if I've learned anything from you

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:16.822
over the years,

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:19.449
it's...

01:16:19.491 --> 01:16:20.867
you've got to have a little faith.

01:16:23.328 --> 01:16:24.579
Come on, you.

01:16:26.873 --> 01:16:28.250
Let's go.

01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:44.474
These shelves are going to look so empty

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:47.269
without all his books.

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:48.145
[meows]

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:49.896
I know, Violet.

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:52.107
I'm having a hard time packing up, too.

01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:07.331
I've got these old clubs.

01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:09.082
We could just hit balls.

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.375
You could, um...

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:11.918
but I probably wouldn't recommend it...

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.919
-Hi!
-Hey there.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.504
Hey!

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:18.007
I brought macaroni and cheese with bacon, homemade,

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.509
so it's probably terrible.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.970
But it's the thought that counts.

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:24.473
Russell, you look great.

01:17:24.514 --> 01:17:26.308
I feel great.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:27.976
I'm just glad to be at home again

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:30.020
with this guy.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:31.271
But we'll still spend lots of time together, right?

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.189
You, me, and Barnabas.

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:33.940
And Ms. Coppersmith.

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.902
Of course! For as long as I'm still here.

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:38.361
Can't thank the two of you enough

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.364
for everything you've done.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.031
My pleasure.

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:43.200
No problem at all.

01:17:43.241 --> 01:17:44.785
Um...

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.538
Cynthia? Uh...

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.957
Go over and say thank you.

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.042
I just... whoa!

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:54.252
Hey!

01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:56.338
Grandpa said I should say thank you.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.255
[laughing warmly]

01:18:03.887 --> 01:18:06.181
I'm going to go put this on the table.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:17.067
Faith, my friend.

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.196
Faith.

01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:23.739
So,

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:27.077
I found out who that woman is that's been visiting Tim.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:28.328
Her name's Olivia Davenport,

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.578
and she is from Wesley.

01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:32.374
That explains why I've never seen her around town.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.625
Turns out

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.502
that she's just having marital problems,

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.420
and he's helping her talk it through,

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:39.089
just like he helps everyone...

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.256
one of the reasons

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:42.884
why he's our most eligible bachelor.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:46.430
It looks like he's off the hook with Sally.

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:47.889
Well, good for Sally.

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:50.183
Every pot deserves its lid,

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.185
and I'm glad she has hers.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.228
Every pot?

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:55.689
Well...

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:58.275
maybe I've already had my lid, and that's all I get.

01:18:58.316 --> 01:18:59.608
I don't think that's true.

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:00.694
Look...

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:03.572
he's not interested in any of them.

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:05.282
Have you seen the way he looks at you?

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:07.576
It does always feel

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:09.785
like he wants to say something to me,

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:11.288
but he never does.

01:19:11.329 --> 01:19:12.788
Maybe he will now.

01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:14.082
Can I talk to you?

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.086
Father Tim,

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.212
can you come for dinner on Friday?

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.213
My niece from...

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.214
I'm sorry, Mrs. Shipley,

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.298
I'm not going to be able to do that.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:24.009
Thank you, though.

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:25.302
Tim, what is it?

01:19:27.053 --> 01:19:28.096
I'm going to follow my own advice,

01:19:28.138 --> 01:19:30.932
and I am going to take a leap of faith.

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:34.770
Yes!

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:39.941
Sorry about that, bud.

01:19:40.984 --> 01:19:42.402
Well...

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.280
I didn't get the girl,

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:46.948
but at least I got the deal.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:56.416
Um...

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.337
I have to catch my breath.

01:20:00.378 --> 01:20:01.963
I'm sorry. I'm...

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:12.557
So what happened? Tell me everything.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:14.893
What's to tell, Marge? You saw what happened.

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:17.103
Yeah... everybody saw.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.605
Right.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.106
So...

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.524
have you seen him?

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:22.609
Not since yesterday.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.527
Well, what are you going to do?

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:25.987
I don't know.

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:28.490
Well, how do you feel about him?

01:20:29.699 --> 01:20:31.284
I just don't think we fit.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.410
Why would you say that?

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:33.870
Well, he's a priest, and I'm me.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.497
He is not looking for a saint.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.832
He's looking for his person.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:41.043
Besides, after everything he did for your garden...

01:20:41.044 --> 01:20:43.296
You mean, what he and Jack did?

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:47.884
Look, Jack is really good at taking credit,

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:50.303
not so good at taking action.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:54.015
The garden was all Tim?

01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:55.391
All Tim.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:58.353
Look, he is the whole package,

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:01.314
and you are his person.

01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:07.236
Jack?

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:10.239
You can come pick up the sign.
I'm not selling.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:13.285
Look, there is no use in
trying to give the hard sell.

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:14.536
I have made up my mind.

01:21:16.162 --> 01:21:17.122
All right, Jack.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.206
You take care.

01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:24.753
So...

01:21:24.754 --> 01:21:26.423
you closed escrow?

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:28.091
Oh...

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.759
no, I, uh...

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.012
I canceled escrow.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.264
Looks like you're not getting rid of your nosy neighbor,

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.431
after all...

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.810
whose garden you redid...

01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.186
by yourself.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.563
You know about that?

01:21:41.605 --> 01:21:43.940
Yeah, I know about that.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.525
And you're not going home.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.071
I am home.

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.657
It just took me a while to realize it.

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:05.253
I can't say I'm disappointed to hear that.

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:08.506
I am thankful...

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:11.176
and I apologize.

01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:13.136
You apologize?

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:14.137
For what?

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.681
From the moment I got here, you saw me.

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:19.434
You made me feel
like the woman I used to be.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:24.314
I had closed up shop after my husband left,

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.441
and you opened it...

01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:29.486
but for some reason,

01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:31.820
I couldn't see you.

01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:33.239
I mean, I did,

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.367
but as a priest,

01:22:35.408 --> 01:22:39.329
and not as the incredible catch

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:42.290
that every woman in this
town knows you are...

01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:46.544
but I won't make that mistake again.

01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:48.630
Well, you'd better not. I am a catch.

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.966
And you're caught.

01:23:06.439 --> 01:23:07.983
So...

01:23:08.024 --> 01:23:09.192
it's a beautiful day.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:14.698
You want to go for a ride
through our fair town?

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:17.784
I'm yours...

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:18.785
but I'm driving.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.662
