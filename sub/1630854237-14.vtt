17:29.462 --> 17:30.842
- Jesus.

17:33.466 --> 17:35.675
No.

17:35.813 --> 17:37.366
- [grunts] It's not budging.

17:37.504 --> 17:39.334
Pam, how's your arm?
Did that hurt at all?

17:39.472 --> 17:42.682
- I--I can't really feel
it anymore.

17:42.820 --> 17:43.959
- Sorry.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.650
- What took you so long?

17:45.788 --> 17:47.204
- A guard stopped me
at the door.

17:47.342 --> 17:50.586
I uh--I had
to talk my way back in.

17:50.724 --> 17:52.071
There's tighter security
here at this college

17:52.209 --> 17:53.486
than at your clinic.

17:53.624 --> 17:55.143
- Warren, do you remember
this woman?

17:55.281 --> 17:57.421
Did she, uh, come
to the clinic?

17:57.559 --> 17:59.008
What happened?

17:59.147 --> 18:00.424
- She came to see Dr. DeLuca,
and I checked her in.

18:00.562 --> 18:02.529
- That's it?
- Yeah.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.014
- [moans]
- Oh, the arm.

18:05.153 --> 18:06.154
- Yeah, we're doing
everything we can.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.673
- No, this arm, the baby's arm.

18:08.811 --> 18:10.089
- There's an arm?

18:10.227 --> 18:12.608
- Devon.
What does that mean?

18:12.746 --> 18:14.369
- It means the baby
must have changed position.

18:14.507 --> 18:16.681
- That's not good, right?
That's bad.

18:16.819 --> 18:18.718
- Not necessarily, but I need
to make sure the baby's

18:18.856 --> 18:20.340
in proper presentation.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.686
- Proper?

18:21.824 --> 18:23.723
- I just need to be sure
the baby's head and arm

18:23.861 --> 18:26.346
are parallel, working
their way into the canal.

18:26.484 --> 18:28.555
- And if they're not?

18:28.693 --> 18:30.557
- We're gonna have to change
the baby's position,

18:30.695 --> 18:32.525
or he could get trapped.

18:34.768 --> 18:37.495
- So Will, uh,
you been drinking?

18:37.633 --> 18:38.876
No?

18:39.014 --> 18:40.395
- Have you eaten
anything suspicious,

18:40.533 --> 18:43.743
like undercooked chicken,
Maya's lasagna?

18:43.881 --> 18:45.814
- Wow.

18:45.952 --> 18:47.540
- How about you guys?
You know anything?

18:47.678 --> 18:49.887
Has he eaten anything
or ingested anything?

18:50.025 --> 18:51.785
Inhaled anything?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.062
- Have you been drinking?

18:53.201 --> 18:54.616
- You just asked him that.

18:54.754 --> 18:56.928
- [scoffs]

18:57.066 --> 18:58.792
- It could be appendicitis.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.725
- Okay.

19:00.863 --> 19:02.727
I'm gonna press
on your appendix,

19:02.865 --> 19:05.040
and if it's ruptured, this
is not gonna be fun, okay?

19:05.178 --> 19:06.041
It's okay.

19:06.179 --> 19:10.597
Let me just--nothing?

19:10.735 --> 19:11.633
Hey, come on, guys.

19:11.771 --> 19:13.566
What--what is going on?

19:13.704 --> 19:14.739
- Nothing, dude.

19:14.877 --> 19:16.293
- Dude?
Nothing?

19:16.431 --> 19:19.261
Your friend's really sick.
You understand?

19:19.399 --> 19:20.987
If there's something going on
with him, we need to know now.

19:21.125 --> 19:22.333
- What do you want me to say?

19:22.471 --> 19:24.335
I-- I don't know anything.

19:25.371 --> 19:26.406

19:39.316 --> 19:41.318
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:41.456 --> 19:43.768
- Andy, Travis.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.287
Uh, you know Robel Osman.

19:45.425 --> 19:46.633
- Yes, of course.

19:46.771 --> 19:48.048
Nice to see you again,
Councilmember.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.051
- He has something he'd like
to discuss with you.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.813
- Look, all the polling
is saying the same thing.

19:53.951 --> 19:55.504
You and I are splitting
the progressive vote.

19:55.642 --> 19:58.335
And if turnout isn't great
on election day,

19:58.473 --> 20:01.407
Dixon could sneak through
and grab the win.

20:01.545 --> 20:04.306
So if you can provide me
a few assurances about policy,

20:04.444 --> 20:07.792
budgetary priorities,
that sort of thing,

20:07.930 --> 20:09.760
I'm gonna drop out
and endorse you.

20:12.349 --> 20:14.454
- Congratulations,
Mr. Montgomery.

20:14.592 --> 20:16.249
You're about to be
the next mayor of Seattle.

20:21.599 --> 20:23.532
- Okay, you guys are giving
me a headache.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.396
You can hold out all you want,
but if you wanna get better,

20:25.534 --> 20:27.605
you gotta come clean.

20:27.743 --> 20:28.986

That's it.
Just get it all out.

It's all gonna come out anyway.
There's no reason to fight it.

20:35.372 --> 20:37.166
Okay, look,
you guys are all very sick,

20:37.305 --> 20:38.167
and we need to know
what caused this.

20:38.306 --> 20:40.825
So did you take any drugs?

20:40.963 --> 20:41.999
- [vomits]

20:42.137 --> 20:43.587
- All right.
You know what?

20:43.725 --> 20:45.209
We're just gonna get them
all in ambulances

20:45.347 --> 20:46.175
and then call
their parents, right?

20:46.314 --> 20:47.660
- Right.
- Just tell them, Kyle.

20:47.798 --> 20:49.213
- Tim, shut up.

20:49.351 --> 20:50.145
- Stop trying
to cover your ass.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.630
Just tell them.
- Tell me what?

20:52.768 --> 20:53.804
- [groans]

21:02.847 --> 21:05.609
- Oh, you guys ate these?

21:05.747 --> 21:07.680
The hottest chip in the world?

21:07.818 --> 21:08.853
- Just one.

21:08.991 --> 21:11.546
It was covered in this.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.513
- It's one
of those stupid challenges.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.550
Eat one chip smothered
in super spicy hot sauce,

21:15.688 --> 21:18.277
then wait an hour
without any food or water.

21:18.415 --> 21:20.279
- How long you last?
- Like 11 minutes.

21:20.417 --> 21:22.419
- I almost made it
the whole hour.

21:22.557 --> 21:23.696
[vomits]

21:23.834 --> 21:25.732
- Yeah, you win, Kyle.
Congrats.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.596
- Thanks a lot for making us
do it in the first place.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.218
- I didn't make you--
- Yes, you did.

21:29.357 --> 21:30.806
You always do.

21:30.944 --> 21:32.325
You're more toxic
than those chips are.

21:32.463 --> 21:35.017
- See, I told you it was
all gonna come out.

21:35.155 --> 21:37.226
- Okay. [groans]

21:37.365 --> 21:39.436
I don't feel so well myself.

21:39.574 --> 21:40.954
- Did you eat a chip?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.197
- No, I didn't eat a chip.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.198
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.268
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Captain!

21:44.406 --> 21:45.718
Captain Ruiz, we need you!

21:45.856 --> 21:48.583

21:48.721 --> 21:51.171

to 25% of funds

21:51.310 --> 21:53.001

and motel repossessions,

is housing

21:55.797 --> 21:57.971
or providing services
to the unhoused.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.594
- That's very important to us.

21:59.732 --> 22:01.354
- As far as green initiatives
are concerned,

22:01.492 --> 22:03.943
we've developed a plan
for graywater reuse,

22:04.081 --> 22:05.945

22:08.568 --> 22:09.914

Just chill out, though.

with him.

22:16.542 --> 22:17.819
- Okay, yeah, have you--
have you talked yet?

22:17.957 --> 22:19.924
- He has been all business.

22:20.062 --> 22:21.132
- Okay.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.687
You know what I was thinking?

22:23.825 --> 22:25.827
I was just, like--

22:25.965 --> 22:30.901
I was just thinking, maybe he's
a little too slick for you.

22:31.039 --> 22:32.972
- What?
- Like--

22:33.110 --> 22:34.145
just, like, I always pictured
you with somebody

22:34.283 --> 22:39.944

like, outdoorsy,

22:40.082 --> 22:42.947

not so much

22:43.085 --> 22:44.570
Prince Harry's
illegitimate cousin.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.226
- Wait, I thought you wanted me
to keep the rom-com alive.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.781
- Well, that was
very selfish of me.

22:51.162 --> 22:52.854
What's for dinner?

22:52.992 --> 22:54.959
- Risotto.

22:56.444 --> 22:58.549
- No.

22:59.757 --> 23:01.828

23:04.831 --> 23:05.798
- How long until
that arm is free?

23:05.936 --> 23:08.387
- Which one?

23:08.525 --> 23:09.836
- Oh, this thing is
like a bank vault.

23:09.974 --> 23:11.390
We're gonna need
the angle grinder.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.046
- I'll call the station,
have them bring one over.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.531
- Okay.
Pam, unfortunately,

23:14.669 --> 23:16.843
the baby is not even
in a compound presentation.

23:16.981 --> 23:19.156
He is transverse, with his arm
out to the side and the head

23:19.294 --> 23:20.226
higher up.

23:20.364 --> 23:21.676
- Oh, my God.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.574
- The good news is
that he must have gotten

23:23.712 --> 23:26.025
annoyed at the exam,
and he pulled his arm back.

23:26.163 --> 23:27.854
I guess he was
just waving hello,

23:27.992 --> 23:30.339
but now I can perform a version
where I can manually

23:30.478 --> 23:32.065
manipulate the
position of the baby

23:32.203 --> 23:33.653
so the head lines up
with the canal.

23:33.791 --> 23:34.930

23:35.068 --> 23:37.933
- Yes, but it's gonna hurt.

I can, Carina.

I know how strong you are.

23:47.149 --> 23:48.737

you want this baby.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.601
You can do this
because you have to.

Onthophagus taurus,Pam.
