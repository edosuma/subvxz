00:22.440 --> 00:24.879
OK. Bye.

00:24.879 --> 00:28.118
- That was Mum.
- Oh, they're back from their holidays?

00:28.120 --> 00:30.719
Yeah, they just got home.
It was a lovely break.

00:30.719 --> 00:34.238
Certainly was, but we can't
keep them away for ever.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.719
Where did Grandma and Grandad go?

00:36.719 --> 00:38.198
They went to Venice.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.478
It's a place in Italy with lots of canals.

00:40.479 --> 00:41.838
I know that.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.198
I know you do, sweetheart,
I was telling Daddy.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.478
It was a special present from all of us
for their wedding anniversary.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.999
50 years. Isn't that amazing?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.639
Certainly is. Your mum deserves a medal.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.999
It's only the "Till death do us part" line
that's keeping her hanging on in there.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.518
Anyway, they're coming around in a bit
to tell us all about it.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.838
Already? They've literally just got back.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.718
- Sorry, is that a problem?
- No. But they are here quite a lot.

01:05.719 --> 01:07.998
Not as much as you.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.920
Actually, I've just remembered,
I've, er... got to pop into work.

01:12.079 --> 01:14.278
- On a Sunday morning?
- Yeah.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.278
Of course. I was forgetting you're
the Archbishop of Canterbury(!)

01:17.280 --> 01:21.399
You're going to be here, and you'll listen
to their holiday stories,

01:21.400 --> 01:23.439
and look at their photos
and smile politely.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.319
Lying and avoiding my parents.

01:27.319 --> 01:29.359
I don't know which one is worse.

01:29.359 --> 01:31.120
Oh, it's definitely your dad.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.399
So, how are you?

01:40.400 --> 01:42.118
Yeah, all fine.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.359
Apart from the usual, Lee
always trying to find an excuse

01:45.359 --> 01:48.998
to nip out when certain people
he has an issue with come around.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.240
- Where is he?
- He's nipped out.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.878
I mean my parents.

01:54.879 --> 01:58.118
It's like he tries to avoid
having anything to do with them.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.558
Sounds like you two are having
a few problems.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.519
Oh, no, just letting off steam.

02:02.519 --> 02:04.879
It's OK, Lucy, you can talk to me.

02:04.879 --> 02:07.558
This might come as a bit
of a surprise to you,

02:07.560 --> 02:10.038
but, just between us,

02:10.038 --> 02:13.118
my marriage to Toby isn't exactly perfect.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.639
No?!

02:15.719 --> 02:18.799
I know. We put on a show
of being this ideal couple,

02:18.800 --> 02:21.079
all sweetness and light.

02:21.079 --> 02:26.318
The truth is, at times, I can be
a little bit abrasive towards Toby.

02:26.319 --> 02:28.478
At times?

02:28.479 --> 02:30.000
I mean, abrasive?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.878
But recently, we decided
to try and improve things,

02:34.879 --> 02:37.118
so we've been for some marriage
guidance counselling.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.519
- Really?
- I have to say, it's been amazing.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.679
I've been talking about things
more, vocalising my feelings.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.278
I'm really opening up.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.278
Wow! What about Toby?

02:46.280 --> 02:47.719
Yes, he comes along, too.

02:49.639 --> 02:51.679
Really, Lucy, you should try it.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.399
Us? Oh, we don't need marriage guidance.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.998
Why not? It would help you get
to the bottom of these issues

02:57.000 --> 02:58.959
he has with your parents.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.878
Look, I can see your marriage
isn't in trouble,

03:00.879 --> 03:02.438
but why wait until it is?

03:02.439 --> 03:04.639
Look at it this way, if you found a lump,

03:04.639 --> 03:07.438
even if you were almost certain
it was nothing serious,

03:07.439 --> 03:09.199
you'd still go to the doctor, right?

03:09.199 --> 03:10.679
I suppose.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.680
Well, in your marriage, there's a lump.

03:16.360 --> 03:16.960
Right.

03:16.985 --> 03:19.959
And I'm quite sure it's absolutely
nothing to worry about,

03:19.960 --> 03:22.038
but it's still worth getting checked out.

03:22.039 --> 03:25.998
You know, on the off chance
it needs to be removed.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.799
Yeah. Thanks for the advice,
but have you ever heard the phrase,

03:29.800 --> 03:32.718
- "taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut"?
- Yes.

03:32.719 --> 03:34.439
Well, I'll probably just do that instead.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.838
Venice was beautiful.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.319
Yes, we loved it.

03:42.319 --> 03:46.799
The food, the architecture. We had
all kinds of new experiences.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.639
Oh, what's Dad doing in this one?

03:48.639 --> 03:50.319
He's smiling.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.118
- Look at this one of Dad.
- That's interesting, Geoffrey.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.039
I never realised you
showed up on photographs.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.759
- So, thank you both.
- Oh, don't be silly.

04:05.759 --> 04:08.118
If you can't put your in-laws
on a plane and send them

04:08.120 --> 04:11.319
1,000 miles across Europe,
what pleasures do we have left?

04:13.599 --> 04:17.199
So... 50 years of marriage.

04:17.199 --> 04:19.999
Come on, then, what's the secret?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.918
Oh, there's no great secret.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.079
If you want to stay married, don't
get divorced and don't die.

04:27.319 --> 04:29.358
So don't leave Lee and don't kill him.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.480
We're not underestimating
the size of the challenge.

04:33.959 --> 04:36.439
Well, we probably should be leaving.

04:36.439 --> 04:38.598
Is everything OK, darling, with you two?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.319
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?

04:40.319 --> 04:42.038
You know we're always here.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.840
Yes, I know you are, and so does Lee.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.439
Bye-bye, darling.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.678
What? I did what you asked.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.558
Really? I don't remember asking
you to make smart-arse comments.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.999
I thought I was quite restrained.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.519
When your mum said that gondolier had taken
her up the Grand Canal, I didn't say a word.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.798
Anna popped around earlier.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.720
That reminds me, the freezer
needs defrosting.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.639
- She told me something quite surprising.
- Oh, really?

05:11.639 --> 05:14.559
Don't tell me, one of her
servants has got rickets?

05:14.560 --> 05:17.278
She and Toby are having
marriage counselling.

05:17.279 --> 05:18.959
And that surprises you?

05:18.959 --> 05:21.358
If I was married to Anna,
I'd want counselling.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.798
I say counselling, it would be
a bloke with a megaphone

05:23.800 --> 05:25.600
telling me to step away from the ledge.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.319
She suggested it might be
good for us to give it a go.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.838
Unbelievable!

05:32.840 --> 05:35.598
Why is it every fad that Anna
picks up, you have to follow?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.639
Pilates, spiralizer, Fitbit. I hope
they never get mauled by tigers,

05:38.639 --> 05:41.519
you'll have me over the fence at Whipsnade
with a pocketful of sausages!

05:43.439 --> 05:44.439
We're fine!

05:44.465 --> 05:47.439
I know we are, but Anna
and Toby were totally fine once.

05:47.439 --> 05:49.158
Why wait until we really need it?

05:49.159 --> 05:50.558
I don't need a colostomy bag,

05:50.560 --> 05:54.038
but it doesn't mean I'm going
to get one fitted just in case.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.199
A counsellor is not the same
thing as a colostomy bag.

05:58.199 --> 06:01.160
Oh, I don't know, I think
there's a key similarity.

06:03.839 --> 06:05.639
Why would you want to copy Anna and Toby?

06:05.639 --> 06:07.158
Who'd want a marriage like theirs?

06:07.160 --> 06:10.439
I don't want a marriage like Anna
and Toby's, I want a marriage like...

06:10.439 --> 06:12.079
Like...?

06:12.079 --> 06:13.519
Oh, I don't know.

06:13.519 --> 06:16.319
Like your mum and dad,
that's what you were going to say.

06:16.319 --> 06:17.129
Where are you going?

06:17.154 --> 06:19.559
To get something to keep polar
bears away from that freezer.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.559
Obviously, they're not
a problem at the moment,

06:21.560 --> 06:23.639
but why wait until we really need it?

06:29.800 --> 06:32.159
- So, how have you been?
- Fine.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.278
Yeah? Everything OK?

06:35.279 --> 06:36.959
Fine.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.798
How's Anna?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.879
Fine.

06:40.879 --> 06:43.199
What do you pay when
your library books are late?

06:46.159 --> 06:47.966
Is there something
you're trying to ask me?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.238
Let me put it another way,

06:49.240 --> 06:51.608
but you promise to tell me
if I'm being too cryptic.

06:51.634 --> 06:52.399
OK.

06:52.399 --> 06:54.279
How's the marriage counselling going?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.759
That is supposed to be confidential.

06:57.759 --> 06:59.680
Yeah, but surely I'm allowed to tell you.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.879
Well, since you know about it anyway,

07:03.879 --> 07:06.678
yes, we have been going to see someone.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.759
So, what are they like, these sessions?

07:08.759 --> 07:11.238
Well, it's not my kind
of thing at all, really.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.639
But at least I get to list
all Anna's faults.

07:13.639 --> 07:16.920
Well, not all her faults, obviously,
the sessions only last two hours.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.600
So, what kind of things
do you talk about?

07:21.625 --> 07:22.478
Everything.

07:22.480 --> 07:27.560
We even have to talk in far too
much detail about our... sex life.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.678
- What kind of things do you say?
- Do you know what, next time,

07:31.680 --> 07:34.999
I'll have a laptop at the ready
so you can join in via Skype(!)

07:35.000 --> 07:36.759
Counselling or the sex?

07:39.319 --> 07:43.119
So, er... how bad had things got
before, you know, you decided to go?

07:43.120 --> 07:45.319
Well, things weren't great.

07:45.319 --> 07:48.439
But at least the counselling
has improved things a bit,

07:48.439 --> 07:50.358
you know, in terms of the arguing

07:50.360 --> 07:53.079
and the sleeping in the spare
room, of course.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.911
Is that where you were
before the counselling?

07:54.937 --> 07:56.343
No, that's where I am now.

07:57.399 --> 07:59.680
Before the counselling,
I was at the Premier Inn.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.879
- Things must have been awful.
- Well, there's no room service,

08:05.879 --> 08:08.319
but it's clean and the showers are good.

08:08.319 --> 08:10.399
And Lenny Henry always
cheers me up at breakfast.

08:12.639 --> 08:13.798
This is terrible!

08:13.800 --> 08:16.158
Well, thanks for your concern,

08:16.160 --> 08:19.079
but, like I say, we're
working things through.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.718
I don't mean for you, I mean for me!

08:20.720 --> 08:23.439
Lucy wants us to go, but she must
think we're in a right state

08:23.439 --> 08:26.598
if she wants to talk to someone who deals
with couples who are that messed up.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.238
Remind me again why we're friends?

08:29.240 --> 08:31.079
Look, it's fine.

08:31.079 --> 08:33.318
The way I see it is this -

08:33.320 --> 08:35.438
marriage is a marathon, not a sprint.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.359
And like a marathon, you
have to keep on going,

08:37.360 --> 08:40.198
drink as much as you can,

08:40.200 --> 08:45.799
and keep telling yourself
over and over, "This will end".

08:48.360 --> 08:50.840
Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:03.360 --> 09:05.278
Ah. You ready to go, Anna?

09:05.279 --> 09:08.480
Or are you too busy discussing more
personal details of our marriage?

09:09.559 --> 09:10.759
What is it this time?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.279
Telling Lucy that I like to keep
my pyjamas on during sex?

09:15.039 --> 09:16.679
No. She didn't mention that.

09:18.279 --> 09:20.798
And why would she? It's a made-up example.

09:20.799 --> 09:22.798
Exactly. Because, as we know, Lucy,

09:22.799 --> 09:26.158
despite their wonderful marriage
counselling, they never have sex.

09:26.159 --> 09:29.678
No, they're having a lot more sex
since counselling, actually.

09:29.679 --> 09:32.058
I think you'll find they're
in separate bedrooms, actually.

09:32.159 --> 09:34.649
Yes, but they have an arrangement
on Wednesdays where they...

09:34.674 --> 09:35.604
All right!

09:37.279 --> 09:40.158
I think I preferred it when you
were talking behind my back.

09:40.159 --> 09:43.399
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry, too, Toby.

09:43.399 --> 09:46.318
I hear what you're saying

09:46.320 --> 09:50.080
and I acknowledge that you're
annoyed with me.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.719
I shared information about our private
life without your consent

09:56.720 --> 10:01.039
and without considering how that might
make you feel.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.719
OK.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.599
Well, I hear what you're
saying, too, Anna.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.719
I appreciate your apology.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.119
I should have understood
that sometimes you need to share

10:15.120 --> 10:17.438
your feelings with friends.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.480
I apologise, too. I shouldn't have
tried to stifle your conversation.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.279
Eurgh!

10:30.679 --> 10:32.158
We should be going.

10:32.159 --> 10:34.558
Thank you for being so honest with us.

10:34.559 --> 10:36.078
It won't go any further.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.759
Of course. And best of luck for Wednesday.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.879
See? Impressive, right?

10:43.879 --> 10:47.639
Impressive? It was like watching
two Daleks trying to mate!

10:47.639 --> 10:50.479
At least their problems
are discussed, Lee.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.838
Unlike the one you have with my parents.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.479
- We're nothing like Toby and Anna.
- Of course we're not!

10:55.480 --> 10:59.479
But counselling's improved
their relationship in all sorts of ways.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.839
You heard, they're having more sex.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.639
Well, are you prepared to give it a go?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.440
If it's what you really want, then,
yes, I'm prepared to have more sex.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.759
What about the counsellor?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.960
I'll have to see a picture of him first.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.479
Have you done any marriage
counselling before?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.159
No. You?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.919
- And what made you come to counselling?
- Her.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.399
He only came because I promised
him a McDonald's on the way home.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.038
- So, you're here reluctantly?
- A bit, yeah.

11:43.039 --> 11:44.399
I think our marriage is fine.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.678
And the way I look at it,
if it ain't broke,

11:46.679 --> 11:48.960
charge it £70 an hour and it soon will be.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.198
Can we not discuss money, please, Lee?

11:53.200 --> 11:54.879
I'm sorry.

11:54.879 --> 11:58.239
Forget the embarrassing discussions
about money, let's just talk about the sex.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.679
That's not the first time
he's used that line to a woman.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.759
That's a joke.

12:04.759 --> 12:06.359
Lee's never paid for sex.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.559
We've got three kids, you always
end up paying for it in the end.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.038
So, why did you want
to come here today, Lucy?

12:15.039 --> 12:18.239
Um... you were recommended to us
by our friends, Toby and Anna.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.519
You know them, right?

12:20.519 --> 12:23.158
I'm afraid I can't discuss
any of my other clients.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.958
I wouldn't admit to that one either.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.678
That would be like saying you
were Shane MacGowan's dentist.

12:29.679 --> 12:32.759
I don't discuss anything
that happens in here at all.

12:32.759 --> 12:34.639
It's all confidential.

12:34.639 --> 12:36.798
Confidential. You could learn from that.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.959
- What does that mean?
- You, discussing our marriage with Anna!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.438
Some things are supposed to be
kept between a husband and wife.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.330
Right?

12:43.355 --> 12:45.999
You're not paying me
to judge or point the finger.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.519
Oh, that's extra, is it?

12:49.480 --> 12:53.678
I only talked to Anna because you
and I don't discuss our problems properly.

12:53.679 --> 12:56.119
Like your attitude towards my parents.

12:56.120 --> 13:00.239
Here we go. Right, you want me
to discuss things, I'll discuss things.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.399
Lucy thinks I have
an issue with her parents,

13:02.399 --> 13:05.038
but the real issue is that she puts
their marriage on a pedestal,

13:05.039 --> 13:07.479
which means she then has
unreasonably high expectations

13:07.480 --> 13:10.558
about our own marriage, and when
we fail to meet those expectations,

13:10.559 --> 13:13.038
she sees it as a failure,
rather than what it really is,

13:13.039 --> 13:16.838
which is the normal tensions that exist
in any loving, happy relationship.

13:16.840 --> 13:20.838
Especially those that don't idealise
their perfect parents' marriage.

13:20.840 --> 13:23.239
- What?
- Well, you asked me to do this properly.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.678
But you weren't supposed
to think about it in advance.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.719
That's cheating!

13:27.720 --> 13:31.200
Does any of Lee's account
strike a chord with you, Lucy?

13:32.559 --> 13:36.318
Well, I suppose I do see my parents
as having the perfect marriage.

13:36.320 --> 13:40.038
When I was growing up, it
was always a very happy home.

13:40.039 --> 13:42.558
And what about you, Lee,
when you were growing up?

13:42.559 --> 13:43.879
Way ahead of you, Doc.

13:43.879 --> 13:47.399
Classic broken home, which, to some,
might suggest an unhappy upbringing,

13:47.399 --> 13:50.438
which led to me having personal
relationship issues as an adult.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.438
But it's actually the complete opposite.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.399
It enables me to value what Lucy
and I have in our own marriage

13:55.399 --> 13:58.119
and makes me less likely to compare
our perfectly happy marriage

13:58.120 --> 13:59.919
with anybody else's.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.018
Maybe you need some one-on-one
time with my wife.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.663
Shall I pop out and get
us all a coffee?

14:06.639 --> 14:08.558
Or maybe it's possible that Lucy,

14:08.559 --> 14:11.639
who comes from a place
of security and warmth,

14:11.639 --> 14:15.839
is more able to vocalise these bigger
questions about your relationship

14:15.840 --> 14:18.519
because she's not afraid of it
causing bigger problems.

14:18.519 --> 14:22.519
Whereas you fear addressing
anything you consider unpleasant

14:22.519 --> 14:25.239
due to your own deep-rooted anxieties.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.359
You what?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.639
How do you get along with Lucy's parents?

14:29.639 --> 14:30.999
Her dad hates me.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.479
It takes two people to make
a bad relationship.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.879
Fair point. Her mum doesn't
like me much either.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.479
Of course they like you.

14:38.480 --> 14:43.038
You talk about them not liking
you, but maybe you don't like them

14:43.039 --> 14:45.318
because of what they represent.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.318
The secure and solid marriage

14:47.320 --> 14:50.078
that you didn't have
around you growing up.

14:50.080 --> 14:52.639
Perhaps Lucy's parents
aren't judging you at all.

14:52.639 --> 14:54.798
Perhaps you're judging yourself.

14:54.799 --> 14:56.719
Hang on. Can we go
out and come back in again?

14:56.720 --> 14:59.639
Yes, I'm going to recommend
you come several times.

14:59.639 --> 15:01.807
No chance. You'll have me
saying I've got desires

15:01.832 --> 15:03.783
to set fire to things
and sleep with my mum.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.318
Oh, I've had enough of this!

15:09.320 --> 15:12.198
Lee, can you sit down, please?
This is progress.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.558
No. I came here on the express condition
that it would be a complete waste of time.

15:15.559 --> 15:18.879
If I'd known it'd be worthwhile,
I would have never agreed to it!

15:26.799 --> 15:28.479
So, you didn't enjoy it?

15:28.480 --> 15:30.879
No, I didn't, and it's all your fault.

15:30.879 --> 15:33.318
- Why?
- Because you've been in there.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.838
You know how awful it is, and you
didn't stop me from going.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.519
This is like Lord of the Dance
all over again.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.719
I didn't exactly recommend
the counselling.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.959
No, but you didn't warn me
that it'd all turn out to be my fault.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.838
Oh, I see.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.558
Yeah, that's right.
It's all me, apparently.

15:49.559 --> 15:51.999
It doesn't mean she's right.
I mean, you're a doctor,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.639
I bet you've made the odd
incorrect diagnosis.

15:54.639 --> 15:57.038
Course I have. I'm not infallible.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.038
But put it this way, if I had
a patient who owned a crocodile

16:00.039 --> 16:02.239
who came in complaining of lower limb pain

16:02.240 --> 16:06.480
and carrying his foot in a plastic
bag, I wouldn't diagnose mumps.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.678
Maybe it's time you made some changes.
I know Anna has.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.119
Exactly, Anna's made the changes,
which means I'm the Anna.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.798
I'm the baddie, I'm the evil one,
I'm the Wicked Witch of the West.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.438
Keep going.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.318
The counsellor said we needed to think
of new pet names for each other.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.678
Look, I know I was sceptical
about the counselling,

16:27.679 --> 16:31.278
and I still am, but I can't deny
it has improved my marriage.

16:31.279 --> 16:33.719
We're sharing a bedroom again.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.519
Really?

16:34.544 --> 16:37.244
Well, Anna has it the first
half of the week...

16:38.120 --> 16:41.519
...I have it the second. But it's a start.

16:41.519 --> 16:43.399
Yeah, well, like I say,
with all due respect,

16:43.399 --> 16:45.438
me and Lucy are not as bad as you two.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.838
I know.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.158
Because if counselling can't help you,

16:49.159 --> 16:51.320
you are worse than me and Anna.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.999
You are worse than me and Anna.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.480
Sorry, it's just not a sentence
I get to say to people very often.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.880
What are you reading?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.358
Really? The Dummy's Guide
to Telepathic Communication.

17:17.759 --> 17:19.960
Oi! No, I will not, cheeky,
I've just brushed my teeth.

17:22.559 --> 17:26.439
Look, I've been thinking,
about your mum and dad.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.598
I already know what you
think of my mum and dad.

17:28.599 --> 17:30.519
Hang on, this is a positive thing.

17:33.960 --> 17:34.920
Go on.

17:34.944 --> 17:37.798
It's true that I don't feel
comfortable around them.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.598
I always thought it was because your dad
was a miserable old sod

17:40.599 --> 17:43.358
who always put me down and expected
everyone to do what he says

17:43.359 --> 17:45.878
and that your mum is also a bit
stuck up in her own sort of way.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.723
Can we print these lovely
words on a cushion

17:47.749 --> 17:49.263
and give it to them for Christmas(?)

17:50.680 --> 17:53.279
But, like the counsellor says...

17:54.480 --> 17:56.598
...maybe it's possible

17:56.599 --> 17:59.278
that I'm threatened by how strong
their relationship is.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.878
And so...

18:00.880 --> 18:03.798
I hear what you're saying,

18:03.799 --> 18:06.519
and perhaps I should start
feeling less threatened

18:06.519 --> 18:08.638
and start admiring them a bit more.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.798
Are you after sex?

18:10.799 --> 18:12.440
No.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.598
Obviously, I'm not
completely ruling it out.

18:16.599 --> 18:18.439
- Go on.
- Excellent!

18:18.440 --> 18:20.558
I mean, keep talking.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.239
Oh.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.798
And so I've decided to make
more of an effort with them.

18:25.799 --> 18:30.679
And I'm going to start by cooking
them a celebratory anniversary meal.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.558
Lee, this is really great.

18:32.559 --> 18:34.919
But can you do me a favour?

18:34.920 --> 18:38.558
Don't mention any of this marriage
guidance stuff in front of Dad.

18:38.559 --> 18:41.038
He thinks it's a sign of weakness
to have semi-skimmed milk.

18:41.039 --> 18:42.638
Course.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.079
Maybe this counselling
is having a real effect.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.079
Good night.

18:55.519 --> 18:57.920
I wish I'd saved this
chat for a Wednesday.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.479
Thank you, darling. We feel very spoiled.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.519
First Venice, now this.

19:09.519 --> 19:12.118
Don't thank me, thank Lee.
He did all the cooking.

19:12.119 --> 19:13.719
I loved the croutons.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.799
They were mushrooms.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.519
And it wasn't just the cooking,
the whole thing was Lee's idea.

19:20.519 --> 19:24.159
Well, I must say, that's very
uncharacteristic.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.118
Careful, Dad, you almost
gave Lee a compliment.

19:27.119 --> 19:29.640
Oh, I'm quite capable of giving
compliments when I want to.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.638
Well, I'm around all evening.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.118
If I were a cynical man, I'd say
you'd done something terrible

19:38.119 --> 19:39.719
and now you were trying to make up for it.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.278
- Dad!
- It's OK, Lucy.

19:42.279 --> 19:44.439
I hear what your dad is saying.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.078
I am trying to make
up for something, Geoffrey.

19:47.079 --> 19:49.318
Lost time with you and Wendy.

19:49.319 --> 19:51.239
Perhaps if I spent more
time with you both,

19:51.240 --> 19:54.479
I'd learn what it takes to have such
a long, fulfilling and wonderful marriage.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.160
My God, he must have done something awful.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.159
Ignore him. I thought this meal
was wonderful, and so does Geoffrey.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.680
Look at his face!

20:06.640 --> 20:10.200
Why don't you two go and make
yourselves comfy and we'll clear up?

20:13.559 --> 20:14.959
Well, this is going well.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.919
Look, I know Dad can be a bit gruff.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.278
It doesn't matter to me
what Dad says or thinks,

20:19.279 --> 20:21.278
what matters to me
is how you're reacting to him,

20:21.279 --> 20:23.240
and you're being really lovely.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.159
Sorry to just land on you like this,

20:28.160 --> 20:30.759
but we were just passing
and thought we'd say hello.

20:30.759 --> 20:33.838
Yeah, nothing at all to do with Anna
wanting to hear about your counselling.

20:33.839 --> 20:35.519
Of course not.

20:35.519 --> 20:37.999
But now that Toby mentions
it, how did it go?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.038
Well, um... we weren't sure at first,

20:40.039 --> 20:42.919
but I have to admit, the results
are pretty impressive.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.558
How many sessions have you had since?

20:44.559 --> 20:46.279
Same as you, just Wednesdays.

20:49.799 --> 20:51.358
Counselling sessions.

20:51.359 --> 20:53.959
Just the one. But I've booked
us in for another.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.617
- Have you?
- Well, I thought that's what you'd want.

20:56.652 --> 20:57.400
Thank you.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.358
Don't forget, someone's still owed
ridiculously undersized McNuggets

21:00.359 --> 21:01.519
and a bit of limp lettuce.

21:01.519 --> 21:04.640
Is there anything you haven't told
them about our sex life, Anna?

21:07.039 --> 21:09.719
I'm talking about McDonald's.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.278
As you were.

21:12.279 --> 21:15.598
Look, I'm sorry to be rude, but Mum
and Dad are here at the moment.

21:15.599 --> 21:17.159
We invited them over for dinner.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.519
Oh, sorry, I didn't realise. Of
course, we'll leave you to it.

21:19.519 --> 21:22.118
It's just that Dad's a bit
old-school about this sort of thing,

21:22.119 --> 21:25.999
so I'm really trying to avoid him finding
out we've been having marriage guidance.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.759
He'd probably say something like...

21:27.759 --> 21:30.638
Marriage guidance? What
the hell are you talking about?

21:30.640 --> 21:32.480
Something like that.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.919
It's, um... Anna and Toby.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.278
They've been going for marriage guidance.

21:39.279 --> 21:40.798
Going through a rough patch.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.480
Keep spreading the word, we're not
quite trending on Twitter yet.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.159
You weren't talking about them, you
were talking about you and Lee going!

21:49.160 --> 21:50.009
Oh, um...

21:50.035 --> 21:52.558
I knew it! I said he'd done
something wrong, didn't I?

21:52.559 --> 21:54.719
Dad, all sorts of people go
for marriage counselling.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.118
It doesn't mean we're in trouble.

21:56.119 --> 21:59.479
Rubbish! It's for marriages
in jeopardy, that's what it is.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.398
The word jeopardy isn't very helpful.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.960
Unless you're playing Scrabble, of course.

22:06.319 --> 22:07.679
So, come on, then, what's he done?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.398
I'll tell you exactly what he's done.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.759
He's made an effort to do something
really nice for you and Mum

22:11.759 --> 22:13.679
and you've thrown it back in his face!

22:13.680 --> 22:15.640
Yeah. I'm glad I didn't
get you that lawnmower.

22:17.359 --> 22:18.798
He's never made an effort before.

22:18.799 --> 22:21.199
He must be trying to atone for something.
So, what is it?

22:21.200 --> 22:23.479
- Nothing!
- Yes, leave Lee alone!

22:23.480 --> 22:25.679
- Shush, Wendy.
- Don't shush me!

22:25.680 --> 22:28.759
Not everyone who goes to marriage
guidance has done something wrong!

22:28.759 --> 22:31.118
For goodness' sake, woman,
stop sticking your nose in!

22:31.119 --> 22:33.759
Not everyone is like you
and your little floozy!

22:36.039 --> 22:38.079
Floozy, another good Scrabble word.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.640
Not as good as jezebel, but...

22:45.400 --> 22:47.838
- What floozy?
- Nothing. Ignore me.

22:47.839 --> 22:50.480
OK. Huh! Can I tempt anyone to an olive?

22:52.079 --> 22:54.279
What, that wasn't her name, was it?

22:56.240 --> 22:56.779
Dad?

22:56.805 --> 22:59.199
It was nothing. It was just
a couple of lunch dates.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.159
Three lunch dates,

23:01.160 --> 23:04.358
one evening at a Berni Inn
and a Demis Roussos concert.

23:04.359 --> 23:06.439
I'm going to take a punt
and say this wasn't recently.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.638
Course it wasn't recently,
it was many years ago,

23:08.640 --> 23:10.759
before you were even born, Lucy!

23:10.759 --> 23:14.239
Absolutely nothing physical
happened, and... and you know it!

23:14.240 --> 23:16.878
I'd never have come if I'd known
Brenda was going to be dragged up.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.559
What, you mean she was actually a man?

23:21.119 --> 23:22.878
- Are you enjoying this?
- No!

23:22.880 --> 23:24.679
Lucy, it was nothing,

23:24.680 --> 23:26.838
and, to be quite honest,
it's none of your business!

23:26.839 --> 23:29.479
Geoffrey's right, what he did
all those years ago is his affair.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.325
- Well, not affair, I mean...
- Shut up!

23:31.348 --> 23:32.358
No, I will not shut up.

23:32.359 --> 23:35.598
I'm doing what you asked and showing
some interest in your parents.

23:35.599 --> 23:38.239
We wanted to know the secret
of their wonderful marriage, now we do.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.054
Oh, my God, you actually
are enjoying this!

23:40.078 --> 23:40.878
Course I'm not.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.838
We had some problems, but we dealt
with them and we moved on.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.838
At least I thought we'd moved on.

23:45.839 --> 23:47.719
That was the whole point
of those sessions.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.878
- What sessions?
- We had some marriage guidance.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.118
Ha! I'm still not enjoying this.

23:54.119 --> 23:56.078
What do you mean, "Ha"?

23:56.079 --> 23:58.719
Well, you know, marriage
guidance, your perfect parents.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.638
I hoped you'd never find out about it,
and you wouldn't have done

24:01.640 --> 24:03.638
if somebody hadn't opened their big mouth!

24:03.640 --> 24:05.318
Oh, typical! I tell you about his fling

24:05.319 --> 24:07.679
and he's more embarrassed
about having counselling!

24:07.680 --> 24:10.439
Good job I didn't mention the pipe
he started smoking during that time

24:10.440 --> 24:12.838
because he thought it made
him look like a poet!

24:12.839 --> 24:14.920
Ha! All right, I enjoyed that one.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.118
Oh, come on, you've got
to admit, it's quite ironic.

24:18.119 --> 24:20.959
We only went to marriage guidance
in the first place to be more like them!

24:20.960 --> 24:22.519
You're using this as a weapon!

24:22.519 --> 24:24.999
So what if they had a bit of counselling?
It's no big deal!

24:25.000 --> 24:27.118
I agree. At least they went
for a proper reason.

24:27.119 --> 24:29.199
- Your dad had an affair.
- How many times...?

24:29.200 --> 24:32.038
I don't know, Geoffrey, is there
others we don't know about?

24:32.039 --> 24:34.318
I should knock your block
off for that comment.

24:34.319 --> 24:38.318
Typical! Never content
until there's a squabble or a ruckus!

24:38.319 --> 24:40.400
Don't mention Scrabble again.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.099
Unbelievable!

24:43.125 --> 24:44.959
Great, I'm getting more
grief than your dad!

24:44.960 --> 24:47.558
Maybe I should have had an affair
and I'd have got off lighter!

24:47.559 --> 24:48.694
Have you got her address?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.239
I'll go down to the nursing
home and wheel Brenda out.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.880
Maybe I can borrow your pipe!

24:54.440 --> 24:58.759
Let's all take a moment
to acknowledge what's been shared.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.038
Lee, I hear what you're saying...

25:03.039 --> 25:04.759
Oh, shut up, Anna!

25:04.759 --> 25:05.959
I beg your pardon?!

25:05.960 --> 25:08.318
If you had kept our business
private in the first place,

25:08.319 --> 25:11.878
instead of telling the whole world,
none of this would have happened!

25:11.880 --> 25:14.239
I don't need permission
to speak from you, Toby.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.719
I am bloody sick of holding my tongue

25:16.720 --> 25:19.358
just to protect your so-called feelings!

25:19.359 --> 25:21.318
Well, I hear what you're saying

25:21.319 --> 25:24.400
and you can stuff it up your jacksie!

25:26.480 --> 25:28.119
Wait for me!

25:32.519 --> 25:35.398
So... where were we?

25:35.400 --> 25:37.519
I was just saying,

25:37.519 --> 25:39.359
how's the marriage guidance going?

25:51.960 --> 25:53.959
Well, that went well(!)

25:53.960 --> 25:55.719
I would book into the Premier Inn,

25:55.720 --> 25:58.359
but Toby and your dad
got the last two rooms.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.440
Look, I know you're angry,
and you've got a right to be.

26:04.799 --> 26:06.999
I should have been more sympathetic.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.479
I was a bit too busy enjoying
your dad being knocked off his perch.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.798
Schadenfreude.

26:12.799 --> 26:16.199
It's when you take pleasure
in another person's misfortune.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.719
It's fairly well-known.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.038
Is it like when you're pleased because you
know a word that somebody else doesn't?

26:21.039 --> 26:22.999
Because we can all play that game.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.599
Bastian Schweinsteiger.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.679
Look, I've said I'm sorry.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.078
I must have missed that.
What language was that in?

26:31.079 --> 26:33.239
Before, when I offered you a Jaffa Cake.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.759
What did you say?

26:34.759 --> 26:37.278
I said, "Do you want a Jaffa Cake?"

26:37.279 --> 26:38.959
That was the apology?

26:38.960 --> 26:40.519
Come on, I put them on a plate,

26:40.519 --> 26:42.559
you must have been able
to read between the lines.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.799
Anyway, I do apologise, and I mean it.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.759
I should have considered your feelings.

26:49.759 --> 26:52.398
And I think I owe you an apology, too.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.519
Turns out my parents aren't
so perfect after all.

26:55.519 --> 26:57.719
They're doing all right, and so are we,

26:57.720 --> 27:00.038
especially after we go
for another counselling session.

27:00.039 --> 27:01.398
Oh, can we not?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.919
Can we just work things
out on our own from now on?

27:03.920 --> 27:06.959
I'm glad we went. It made
us talk things through,

27:06.960 --> 27:09.479
and that's all I ever wanted.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.839
Course.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.519
So I guess there's nothing else left to do
now apart from have sex and move on.

27:15.519 --> 27:17.519
Actually, I'm a bit tired.

27:17.519 --> 27:19.839
Good night.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.839
I wonder what time
that McDonald's drive-thru closes?
