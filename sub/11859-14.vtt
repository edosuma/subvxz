00:18.375 --> 00:20.000
- Welcome to the
neighborhood.
- Thanks.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.625
You're gonna love it here.

00:23.709 --> 00:26.041
- Which house is yours?
- Oh, I don't live here.

00:26.125 --> 00:29.667
Roy W. Dunn, Sampson Brush
and Housewares representative.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.083
Noticed you've made
some improvements.

00:31.166 --> 00:32.834
I sure did, new carpeting.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.083
Sampson's patented
spot removers and brushes

00:35.166 --> 00:36.250
keep that carpet
looking aces.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.667
You'll have
to try back
later.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.208
Wife's at the butcher
picking up the Sunday
roast.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.166
Well, then, please give her
this complimentary Tidy Brush.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.542
- Twenty five year warranty.
- Thanks.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.834
Missus needs all
the help she can
get

00:46.917 --> 00:48.291
when it comes
to the
housework.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.834
Hello.

01:33.709 --> 01:34.667
Yoo-hoo!

01:36.458 --> 01:37.667
Roy!

01:37.750 --> 01:38.750
Be right over, Joannie.

01:41.083 --> 01:43.083
I've been waiting all morning.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.583
Where have been?

01:44.667 --> 01:45.667
Had something to take care of.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.583
Hmm. What, pray tell?

01:48.667 --> 01:50.166
Did you hear
about Candy Toliver?

01:50.250 --> 01:52.125
Oh, just can't believe it.

01:52.208 --> 01:53.667
I guess you never do know.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.041
No, you don't.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.417
That Wilson girl from
down
the street got arrested

01:59.500 --> 02:02.625
for singing folk songs
at an anti-war rally.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.834
- Strange times, to be sure.
- Mm.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.417
Let me check my book.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.709
Can't be the silver polish.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.333
You took delivery
of that last week.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.000
Spray starch?

02:13.083 --> 02:15.917
You do know exactly
what I need, Roy.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
It's my job to know.

02:20.375 --> 02:23.917
Let me stand to show
that you are blind ♪♪

03:03.166 --> 03:06.291
Local developer drained the
pond
to make way for more houses.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.750
Found a body on the bottom.

03:08.834 --> 03:12.750
Tech estimates male,
mid 30s.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.458
How long has
he been down here?

03:14.542 --> 03:17.417
(Jeffries)
'Oh, that's a question
for the bone squad.'

03:18.875 --> 03:20.375
(Rush)
This place was a park, right?

03:20.458 --> 03:22.917
(Jeffries)
'The surrounding streets
all had access.'

03:24.291 --> 03:26.333
Weights.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.667
Somebody wanted the body
to stay down.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.333
Can I borrow your coffee?

03:39.417 --> 03:40.542
Got an inscription.

03:40.625 --> 03:43.208
"Roy W. Dunn."

03:43.291 --> 03:47.375
"Sampson Brush
Salesman Of The Year. 1966."

03:47.458 --> 03:49.000
(Valens)
'Door-to-door salesman?'

03:49.083 --> 03:52.291
And Sampson was a competitor
to the Fuller Brush company.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.959
Sold a lot more than brushes.

03:54.041 --> 03:57.291
Well, somebody didn't like
what Roy was selling.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.125
Or he knocked on
the wrong door.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.250
Whoa! Whoa!

04:41.333 --> 04:42.250
Whoa.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.625
Little privacy?

04:43.709 --> 04:45.417
Is something wrong
with your dugout?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.959
Flooded.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.667
Now if you don't mind
I gotta tidy up and tuck in?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.041
"Roy W. Dunn. 35 years old."

04:55.125 --> 04:57.291
Well, Sampson Brush Company
regional manager

04:57.375 --> 04:59.709
filed a theft report
on June 9th

04:59.792 --> 05:01.792
alleging Roy
checked out company property

05:01.875 --> 05:04.709
on June 6th, then took off with
money collected from customers.

05:04.792 --> 05:07.542
Along with $250 worth
of Sampson products.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.375
(Miller)
Well, guess we can
close
the books on that one.

05:09.458 --> 05:13.041
Search of Roy's tenement room
back in '67 yielded nada.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.500
Guy lived out of a suitcase.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.041
It doesn't sound like
Sampson's Salesman of the year.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.458
Don't see many
door-to-door salesmen anymore.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.375
Ah, different times. Used
to be you could get anything

05:21.458 --> 05:23.000
from fresh chickens and Bibles

05:23.083 --> 05:25.542
to Grit magazine
delivered right to your door.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, now I got some guy
from a phone bank

05:27.083 --> 05:28.458
calling me during the game.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.166
Lot of these guys
just blew into a town

05:30.250 --> 05:31.208
looking to make a quick buck

05:31.291 --> 05:32.750
before moving on
to the next one.

05:32.834 --> 05:36.166
Well, maybe Roy tried to run
off
with some lonely housewife.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.917
Husband got wind of it,
put a stop to it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.667
Well, that or he got mixed up
in some scam.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.917
Run his name
through the NCIC database

05:43.000 --> 05:44.166
see if we get a hit.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.166
Hey!

05:47.250 --> 05:49.250
'Missed a spot.'

05:49.333 --> 05:51.208
You get anything back
from the lab, Nick?

05:51.291 --> 05:54.208
Uh, barbells found with the body
were sold in hundreds of places.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.125
- What about the plastic?
- 'Nothing special.'

05:56.208 --> 06:01.083
But forensics, uh, found, uh
deep abrasions on his ribcage.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.583
Or could have been stabbed.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.166
Or eaten by snapping turtles.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.792
'I just got off the horn
with Sampson Brush.'

06:05.875 --> 06:08.625
They're faxing over Roy's
route
and his customer list.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.000
Start a canvas,
might be some folks

06:10.083 --> 06:11.667
on the block
still remember Roy.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.166
Better yet.
I got the name of the salesman

06:14.250 --> 06:15.333
who took over Roy's route.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.625
Harry Hapgood.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.125
Uh, he's still out there
pounding the pavement.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.125
Uh, didn't figure
you
for
tighty-whities.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.125
Rush.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.583
Yeah, she got quite an eyeful.

06:24.667 --> 06:27.208
Oh, for the record,
they're boxer briefs.

06:27.291 --> 06:30.083
Right. And the grooming at work?

06:30.166 --> 06:31.542
I'm in a transitional state.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.417
What's that mean?

06:33.500 --> 06:34.667
Means I got a
crick
in my neck

06:34.750 --> 06:36.667
from sleeping on
the office couch.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.166
Waking up smelling
like nervous perp.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.291
You let Toni
move
in, didn't you?

06:43.375 --> 06:46.333
- Yup.
- And now you're out?

06:46.417 --> 06:47.458
Yup.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.875
Roy W. Dunn.

06:50.959 --> 06:51.875
Ooh!

06:51.959 --> 06:53.375
That's going way back.

06:53.458 --> 06:54.625
When was the last time
you saw him?

06:54.709 --> 06:56.375
Would have been a Wednesday.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.166
We met every Wednesday
for breakfast.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.542
Right here, as
a matter of fact.

06:59.625 --> 07:00.834
One day he didn't show.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.667
- Summer of '67?
- Second week of June.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.083
I remember 'cause that week

07:05.166 --> 07:07.542
the company called me
to sort out his route.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.208
You got a real good memory,
Harry.

07:09.291 --> 07:10.417
You betcha.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.834
Not for nothing
I've been selling

07:11.917 --> 07:14.083
Sampson for 45 years.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.417
Keep the orders up here.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.959
What kind of salesman was Roy?

07:18.041 --> 07:21.625
Roy had every housewife
on his route

07:21.709 --> 07:23.500
pecking out of his hand.

07:23.583 --> 07:27.208
Tall, dark and a double shot
of mysterious.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.333
Mysterious how?

07:28.417 --> 07:29.834
'He never talked about his past'

07:29.917 --> 07:31.417
'and he wasn't
from around here.'

07:31.500 --> 07:35.542
I saw his apartment once,
and he slept on the floor.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.834
No mattress, no pillow.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.417
Nothing but floorboards.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.667
Bit of an odd duck, then.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.166
Odd, but, uh..

07:42.250 --> 07:46.208
...he looked like Paul
Newman
and he wasn't married.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.458
I tell you, there were
a lot
of steamed housewives

07:49.542 --> 07:51.458
when I took over the route
for him.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.709
He selling something
other than brushes?

07:53.792 --> 07:55.291
[clears
throat]
Come again?

07:55.375 --> 07:59.333
Was Roy having an affair
with any of these housewives?

07:59.417 --> 08:00.792
Not that I saw.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.500
Roy was all business.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.875
And that route of his was
what we call low-hangin'
fruit.

08:06.959 --> 08:10.000
Same route you took over when
he disappeared right, Harry?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.208
Stop right there, detective.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.125
I had no beef with Roy.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.542
He trained me.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.917
He taught me
how to get to
yes.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.875
(Roy)
'I'm concerned about
your drapes, Joannie.'

08:21.959 --> 08:24.750
What's wrong with them?

08:24.834 --> 08:25.792
Let's have a look.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.333
Maybe your friend
would like to join us?

08:31.417 --> 08:32.625
Oh. I should get back.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.083
(Joannie)
'Oh, come on, Diane.'

08:34.166 --> 08:35.917
Roy won't bite.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.041
I'd really like you
to see this, Diane.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.083
You see this dust
and dirt right here?

08:48.166 --> 08:50.291
Only way to get rid of it is
take down the drapes

08:50.375 --> 08:52.417
launder them
and hope you don't ruin them.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.625
Where's the time?

08:53.709 --> 08:55.625
Exactly why Sampson
created this innovative

08:55.709 --> 08:57.291
drape and upholstery brush.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.667
Oh.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.542
Dirt just lifts out.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.125
I want one.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.709
Harry, write Joannie's order
up
and throw in a free sample

09:06.792 --> 09:08.834
of our new skin care line.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.291
Can I put you down
for one, Diane?

09:11.375 --> 09:14.041
- Um..
- Diane's husband's a
tightwad.

09:14.125 --> 09:17.083
- He's got her on a budget.
- Joannie.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.333
I've got
Wednesday afternoon open.

09:19.417 --> 09:20.834
I can come by.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.792
I should, uh, probably check
with my husband.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.125
I want you to have this.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.250
- Oh, I can't.
- And I insist.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.625
Lemme know when you want some of
our Crystal View Window Cleaner.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.125
Keep that window I see you
looking out of every day

09:38.208 --> 09:39.500
gin clear.

09:43.709 --> 09:48.291
[laughs]
I'll bet old Roy put
that dust on those
drapes

09:48.375 --> 09:50.166
while no one was looking.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.583
Joannie Pogue married?

09:51.667 --> 09:55.375
At the time, but her husband
was always away on business.

09:55.458 --> 09:57.208
She always putting it
out there like that?

09:57.291 --> 09:59.083
Just for old Roy.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.375
She around?

10:00.458 --> 10:02.667
23 Harmondale Lane.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.542
Would you like one
of my lemon bars, detective?

10:09.625 --> 10:10.709
Sinfully good.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.792
Uh, no, I'm-I'm good.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.083
We're here about Roy Dunn.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.625
Word travels fast.

10:19.709 --> 10:22.917
Heard Roy was quite popular
with the local housewives.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.834
Well, he was attentive

10:24.917 --> 10:26.583
and polite, handy

10:26.667 --> 10:28.542
and he knew exactly
what you wanted.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.375
What did you want, Joannie?

10:30.458 --> 10:32.250
Detective, are you asking me

10:32.333 --> 10:33.750
if I was having an affair
with Roy?

10:33.834 --> 10:34.917
Were you?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.208
It was a purely
professional flirtation.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.875
I liked having Roy over

10:39.959 --> 10:42.250
and he liked selling me
his products.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.250
Uh, swinging '60s,
and Roy wouldn't swing?

10:45.333 --> 10:48.375
Oh, not around here,
it wasn't.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.625
We kept up appearances.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.375
You remember last time
you saw him?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.375
Easy. I went out in the front
yard to get a little color.

11:00.917 --> 11:02.125
Hey there, buddy.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.959
Show you how to throw a slider.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.417
Roy.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.583
- Yes, Joannie.
- What do you think?

11:24.667 --> 11:27.083
Natalie Wood has one
just like it.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.208
[laughs]
Oops.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.291
Sorry about that.
Just toss it back.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.083
Hey, in there.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.333
- Need the ball back.
- 'Good luck.'

11:46.417 --> 11:48.291
Abnormal Norm just added it
to his collection.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.125
- That's not right.
- 'Take a look, Roy.'

11:50.208 --> 11:51.625
(Joannie)
'The whole family's
not right.'

11:51.709 --> 11:54.458
You don't want to go
in there. Trust me.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.041
- Just leave it.
- Well, I'm going in.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.125
If I don't come back,
call the National Guard.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.500
- 'Hold it right there,
mister.'
- 'I'd like the ball back.'

12:04.583 --> 12:07.250
I'd like you to get
off my property.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.458
What about this,
uh, Abnormal Norm?

12:14.542 --> 12:17.750
Went to Vietnam,
stepped on a land mine

12:17.834 --> 12:20.125
scarred his face horribly.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.917
Was never right after that.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.792
The city's been trying
to condemn the house for years.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.291
Did he have a problem with Roy?

12:26.375 --> 12:29.166
Hard to tell.
He was a bit of a recluse.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.000
And the only time I ever
saw him was in the park.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.542
What was he doing
down there?

12:33.625 --> 12:35.000
Feeding the ducks.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.667
Got very upset
when he heard

12:36.750 --> 12:40.041
they were draining the pond
to put in more houses.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.750
Police. Open up.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.375
Hey! Hands off the Creedence.

13:00.542 --> 13:01.709
Get your damn hands off--

13:01.792 --> 13:04.333
- Whoa.
- This is private property.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.834
Wrong move, Rambo.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.625
Should have opened up
and answered our questions.

13:07.709 --> 13:10.250
You just gave us a reason
to search this dump.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.000
Should have brought
your hazmat suit, boss.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.291
What do we got?

13:17.375 --> 13:20.291
Besides a million
city code
violations?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.834
(Stillman)
'Oh, quite a collection.'

13:21.917 --> 13:23.166
(Rush)
'Hoarding started with the
mom.'

13:23.250 --> 13:25.125
Son can't bear
to throw anything out.

13:25.208 --> 13:28.041
- 'She still in the
picture?'
- 'She passed last year.'

13:28.125 --> 13:29.959
Over here.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.500
Balls and bikes.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.792
Looks like Norm
had a filing system.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.125
And library books,
overdue 40 years.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.875
And this.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.500
(Stillman)
'"Roy W. Dunn."'

13:48.458 --> 13:51.041
Checked out, never returned.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.250
Roy keep track
of his appointments?

14:00.333 --> 14:01.458
No, it's mostly notes

14:01.542 --> 14:03.458
on who bought what
and the money collected.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.583
Found this inside.
It's addressed to Alice.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.333
Hundred bucks.
Lot of money back
then.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.750
Payoff?

14:11.834 --> 14:14.000
Well, whatever it was,
Roy never got to deliver it.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.667
Miller's checking the name
against Roy's customer list.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.458
That supposed
to mean somethin'?

14:32.542 --> 14:34.583
Salesman named Roy W. Dunn.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.583
- How did you get that book?
- Found it.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.041
- In the park by the pond.
- 'How about that.'

14:39.125 --> 14:42.458
We just found him
fertilizing
your precious duck pond.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.417
After you killed
him
and sunk the
body.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.875
Why would I do that?

14:45.959 --> 14:48.583
Neighbor saw you and Roy
having words after he
went

14:48.667 --> 14:50.667
to get a baseball
back
for a kid on the
street.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.291
That's a good motive.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.208
Seen folks killed for a pair
of $20 kicks and a bus pass.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.959
Roy asked
and I gave the ball back.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.208
Even though I had
every right to keep it.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.333
Sounds like a real
lifesaver moment.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.542
You're a funny guy, detective.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.583
No, what's funny, Norm is you
assaulting a police officer

15:08.667 --> 15:11.375
then keeping a book that
ties you to the murder
victim.

15:11.458 --> 15:15.542
I'd say that's good for
25 years of belly laughs

15:15.625 --> 15:17.041
depending what
the jury
thinks.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.959
This stuff's not gonna work
on me, detectives.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.458
Abnormal Norm.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.333
The neighborhood bogeyman.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.959
- Boo.
- 'What?'

15:29.041 --> 15:30.458
'You didn't like the way
Roy stared at you?'

15:30.542 --> 15:32.333
He was not the only one
who didn't.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.125
Roy was okay by me.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.542
But not everyone
on the street liked him.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.375
Something wrong?

15:50.458 --> 15:52.709
We didn't order this stuff.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.083
Your wife, Diane,
placed the order.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.667
Well, she must
have made a mistake.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.083
Okay. But you've already
paid for them.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.375
And I said..

16:02.875 --> 16:04.959
...we don't want them.

16:05.041 --> 16:08.875
Look, it was not my intention
to cause any trouble.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.959
- Maybe I misunderstood.
- I know what you're up to.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.208
I know your type, mister.

16:16.291 --> 16:18.250
I was just doing my job.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.583
Then do it somewhere else.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.583
Glenn Drew.
Guy was a hothead?

16:32.667 --> 16:35.375
Lot of happy, happy,
joy, joy crap on that
street.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.375
Everyone pretending
to be normal

16:37.458 --> 16:40.583
while the world around
them
was going to the dogs.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.125
When was this argument
with Glenn?

16:42.208 --> 16:43.417
It was maybe
a couple of
weeks

16:43.500 --> 16:45.917
before Roy stopped
coming around.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.375
Are we done here?

16:47.458 --> 16:49.709
Or are there more of my rights
you want to trample?

16:51.166 --> 16:52.458
You're not
going anywhere, Norm.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.125
I didn't kill Roy.

16:55.834 --> 16:59.041
The only killing I ever
did
was for my country.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.333
And look what it got me.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.333
She gave up her apartment.

17:10.417 --> 17:11.959
No reason staying
in the same building

17:12.041 --> 17:14.875
paying two rents,
two cable bills.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.500
Giving her the key
was your first
mistake.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.583
Woman could burn.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.333
She made an omelet with salami,
onions, and peppercinis.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.333
Probably making one right
now for some other guy.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.166
- I'm not going there.
- You're not going home,
either.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.208
Exactly why you need
a plan of action.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.125
Got a hit on Roy's name.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.750
Turns out he's got
an FBI number.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.250
So, our boy, Roy,
wasn't so squeaky clean.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.917
Number was generated
out of New York State in '57.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.625
(Jeffries)
'Any indication of the
crime?'

17:46.709 --> 17:48.750
Haven't digitized records
that far back yet.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.709
Request a hand search?

17:50.792 --> 17:51.959
Hurry up and wait.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.208
Lilly? You alright?

18:23.750 --> 18:24.917
She's dead.

18:26.834 --> 18:27.959
'My mother.'

18:30.375 --> 18:32.125
You asked how she was and..

18:45.083 --> 18:46.291
I'm sorry.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.500
Lilly, I'm..

18:50.583 --> 18:52.458
I just thought
you might wanna know.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.000
What happened?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.834
Cirrhosis.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.083
Year and a half ago.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.583
Never stopped drinking.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.750
All those years.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.041
Tried to get her to stop.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.166
She hid bottles.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.959
Disappeared for days.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.959
It was her cross.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.834
She was staying with me.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.542
She just gave in to it.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.166
'And I let her.'

19:33.667 --> 19:36.083
All I could do was watch.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.917
It wasn't your fault, Lilly.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.083
Sorry you had to go
through that alone.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.250
Somebody had to.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.208
Your mother and I..

19:56.208 --> 19:57.375
We, uh..

20:04.166 --> 20:07.250
Sometimes it's better
when people don't stay
together.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.250
Where is she?

20:20.041 --> 20:21.166
In Saint Anne.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:40.291 --> 20:41.959
Traffic was bad.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.792
I didn't have any trouble.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.208
Okay, let's do this.

20:54.875 --> 20:58.000
Made that myself.
It's called the Crazy X.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.083
Looks easy enough.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.625
[chuckles]
Oh, no.

21:01.709 --> 21:02.875
That's a real stumper.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.458
We're here about Roy Dunn.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.375
That, uh, salesman
that turned up?

21:07.458 --> 21:11.667
Shame, they're taking out the
park and putting in more
houses.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.959
You purchase Sampson
products from him?

21:14.041 --> 21:15.125
Once.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.500
Stuff was all overpriced.

21:17.583 --> 21:18.542
Where are my manners?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.000
Would you like
something to drink?

21:20.083 --> 21:21.667
A soda, glass of wine?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.458
Honey, it's 3 o'clock.

21:23.542 --> 21:26.542
Oh, um, I'll make
some coffee.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.667
I'll-I'll help.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.041
It won't take long.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.000
Uh, Glenn got this new machine.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.250
Beans to brew in five minutes.

21:37.625 --> 21:41.291
You wanna tell us about the
argument you had with Roy?

21:42.875 --> 21:45.250
Didn't like Roy with your
wife
when you were at work?

21:46.500 --> 21:49.834
Actually, it had to do
with my son, Kevin.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.917
You're gonna have
to be more specific,
Glenn.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.125
Kevin was having trouble
at school.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.375
Moody, getting in fights and..

21:56.458 --> 21:58.000
Roy have something
to do with that?

21:58.083 --> 22:01.333
I had a bad feeling about
the guy. Just wasn't right.

22:01.417 --> 22:02.542
Thirty five year
old bachelor

22:02.625 --> 22:04.709
spending time
with a 15-year-old kid.

22:08.750 --> 22:11.458
(Roy)
'You're dropping
your elbow. Use your legs.'

22:11.542 --> 22:13.834
Were you good enough
to play in the big leagues?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.834
At one time.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.125
(Kevin)
'I knew it.'

22:20.375 --> 22:21.750
(Roy)
'I was your age'

22:21.834 --> 22:24.417
used to play all day
just to get out of the
house.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.667
(Kevin)
'What do you mean?'

22:25.750 --> 22:27.792
My house wasn't a place
you wanted to be.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.166
(Glenn)
'Kevin!'

22:31.250 --> 22:32.917
- Get in the car, son.
- I-I didn't mean--

22:33.000 --> 22:35.792
You are not allowed in the
park
without permission.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.917
What do you
think
you're doing?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.166
Just showing him some pitches.

22:46.250 --> 22:48.333
- Kid's got a hell of an arm.
- I thought I made myself
clear.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.583
I don't want you
around my family.

22:50.667 --> 22:51.667
Look, I didn't mean any--

22:51.750 --> 22:54.375
No, you look.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.959
I catch you hanging
around Kevin again

22:56.041 --> 22:57.291
I'll call the cops.

22:59.667 --> 23:02.875
Sorry.
It won't happen again.

23:07.166 --> 23:09.875
I didn't like the way
he looked at me.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.125
I didn't like he was
spending time with my son.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.458
So, I called the police.

23:13.542 --> 23:14.959
They share your concerns?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.333
They said there just
wasn't much they could do

23:16.417 --> 23:18.959
unless this
Roy did something.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.959
You take matters
into your own
hands?

23:22.041 --> 23:23.959
No.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.458
But one night I was coming home
from work and I saw him

23:26.542 --> 23:28.500
<i>standing outside</i>
<i>this woman's house.</i>

23:46.208 --> 23:47.875
I mean, there he was just..

23:47.959 --> 23:49.792
...lurking around
some other family.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.000
- And where was this?
- Kettle Street.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.750
'It's on the other
side of the park.'

23:54.834 --> 23:57.375
The guy was up to no good.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.834
[sighs]
I was just trying
to protect my family.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.166
Understandable.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.125
We're gonna need
a number for
Kevin.

24:04.417 --> 24:05.583
Oh, sure thing.

24:08.917 --> 24:12.333
Here's one. "Free rent in
exchange for light clerical

24:12.417 --> 24:13.834
and a weekly massage."

24:13.917 --> 24:16.333
Hmm. I better call on
that one right away.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.458
For somebody out there,
that's the perfect
arrangement.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.834
Not this cowboy.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.375
Just got Roy's jacket
from the FBI.

24:25.083 --> 24:26.709
Manslaughter?

24:26.792 --> 24:28.375
'Did seven years in Sing Sing.'

24:28.458 --> 24:31.583
Killed a guy named Jim Mills
in a bar fight in Albany.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.792
Check out the name of his widow.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.542
Alice Mills.

24:35.625 --> 24:38.250
Same Alice on the envelope
we found in Roy's book?

24:38.333 --> 24:39.709
Lives right here in Philly.

24:39.792 --> 24:41.834
Kettle Street.
Six blocks from the park.

24:41.917 --> 24:45.875
Same place Glenn Drew
saw Roy watching that woman.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.375
Looks like Roy had a past.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.542
And it caught up to him
with a vengeance.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.750
Well, of course
I remember Roy Dunn.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.000
How could I not?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.458
When was the last
time
you saw him, Alice?

25:06.542 --> 25:08.917
Why are you asking me about Roy?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.417
'Cause we found his body,
six blocks from your old
house.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.417
Roy killed your husband
in a bar fight back in
Albany.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.375
I lived through it, detective.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.750
- I know what happened.
- He made you a widow.

25:21.834 --> 25:25.083
Served his time, then he
follows you down here?

25:25.166 --> 25:27.417
Fill in the blanks
for us, Alice.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.083
We found this
in Roy's
notebook.

25:30.166 --> 25:33.125
Maybe you can shed some light
on what the money was for.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.250
Look, Roy and my husband

25:38.333 --> 25:40.959
'were teammates
on the Albany Senators.'

25:41.041 --> 25:42.250
Minor league baseball.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.333
Roy's curve ball was good
enough
for the majors.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.709
Jim's talent
was drinking too much

25:49.792 --> 25:52.125
and taking it out
on the one person

25:52.208 --> 25:53.291
who wouldn't fight back.

25:53.375 --> 25:55.792
- He hit you?
- Yes.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.125
Roy took offense.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.917
He saw me with a black eye.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.625
Told Jim if he laid another
hand on me, he'd be sorry.

26:03.709 --> 26:04.792
And Roy swung first?

26:04.875 --> 26:06.792
That's what the witnesses said.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.625
After the trial, my son
and I moved to Philly.

26:11.709 --> 26:16.166
Then out of the blue, these
envelopes filled with money

26:16.250 --> 26:18.417
would show up in my mailbox.

26:23.709 --> 26:26.959
Roy.
What are you doing?

26:27.041 --> 26:28.333
- Nothing, I..
- Roy, please, wait!

26:28.417 --> 26:29.583
I wanna talk to you.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.542
'Sorry, I shouldn't be here.'

26:33.375 --> 26:34.583
I just wanna help.

26:36.917 --> 26:38.917
By sneaking around
and leaving money?

26:40.542 --> 26:41.875
For what I did to you.

26:45.291 --> 26:46.792
I shouldn't have
gotten involved.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.709
Everybody knew
what Jimmy was doing

26:51.792 --> 26:53.792
and they all chose
to look the other way.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.125
I couldn't do that.

27:00.583 --> 27:03.166
And I should've walked away
the first time he hit me.

27:07.625 --> 27:08.917
He didn't deserve you.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.250
That's in the past now, Roy.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.625
I don't blame you.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.542
I spent every
day
in that cell..

27:21.792 --> 27:23.583
...thinkin' about
what
I'd done to you.

27:26.125 --> 27:27.375
Should've just walked away.

27:28.834 --> 27:30.500
You're not
the walking-away kind.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.542
I know.

27:34.375 --> 27:35.959
Sometimes I wish I could be.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.250
Did he say
anything else that day?

27:42.333 --> 27:44.458
No, we just talked
about his job.

27:45.959 --> 27:47.417
But I thought
there was something

27:47.500 --> 27:51.166
about one of those houses
that was eating at him.

27:51.250 --> 27:52.583
You ask him about it?

27:52.667 --> 27:54.959
Said he had a clear
view of things.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.208
I thought he was talking
about a woman.

27:58.917 --> 28:03.166
But I got a sense that
there was more to it.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.000
Hello, Diane.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.333
Oh, excuse me.

28:22.458 --> 28:23.625
On sale.

28:23.709 --> 28:27.417
- Hmm, mother's little
helper.
- I'm sorry?

28:27.500 --> 28:30.583
The phone number you gave us for
your son Kevin, didn't work.

28:30.667 --> 28:31.959
Turns out he moved.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.750
Two years ago.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.458
Glenn must've given
you the old number.

28:35.542 --> 28:38.458
Sure, I just thought
maybe you had a falling out.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.875
You still talk with your son?

28:39.959 --> 28:41.917
My husband already answered
your questions.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.458
But you didn't.

28:43.542 --> 28:46.041
Made sure you were out of the
room while he answered for you.

28:48.333 --> 28:50.166
What's this all about?

28:50.250 --> 28:51.333
You and Roy.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.417
Glenn tell you to lie?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.000
What are you insinuating?

28:56.083 --> 28:57.959
'Glenn's a pretty
controlling guy.'

28:58.041 --> 29:00.000
Seen a few of his type
in my day.

29:01.458 --> 29:02.792
That how you cope with it?

29:04.375 --> 29:07.458
Glenn is a very good man.

29:07.542 --> 29:08.583
But Roy..

29:10.417 --> 29:12.250
Something you wanna
tell me, Diane?

29:16.291 --> 29:18.250
You weren't alone.

29:18.333 --> 29:19.500
Just lonely.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.917
- No, please!
- Can't say I blame you.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.458
Husband like Glenn.

29:23.542 --> 29:25.917
But if he found out that
you were having an affair.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.917
It wasn't an affair.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.333
It wasn't anything.

29:48.667 --> 29:49.750
Diane.

29:55.834 --> 29:57.083
I wanna help you.

30:01.875 --> 30:03.250
It's..

30:03.333 --> 30:04.542
It's Glenn.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.041
He's, uh..

30:09.125 --> 30:11.792
He's not at work when he says
he is and..

30:11.875 --> 30:14.959
And when I ask him
about it, he lies to me,
so..

30:16.500 --> 30:18.125
When he's home,
it's even worse.

30:21.709 --> 30:23.500
It doesn't get any better.

30:26.625 --> 30:27.709
I'm just..

30:28.750 --> 30:30.041
I'm so tired of pretending

30:30.125 --> 30:32.250
that everything is perfect
when it's not.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.458
It's what people do here.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.625
I see it every day.

30:48.917 --> 30:50.041
You could leave.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.125
No, no, I can't leave.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.583
That would, uh..

30:57.667 --> 30:59.417
That would be impossible, Roy.

31:02.500 --> 31:04.291
Is it?

31:04.375 --> 31:05.458
(Kevin)
'Mom?'

31:07.083 --> 31:08.208
No, Kevin!

31:08.291 --> 31:09.875
Kevin, wait!

31:13.166 --> 31:15.166
Letting Kevin see
me
with Roy like that

31:15.250 --> 31:17.166
was the biggest
mistake
of my life.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.458
What did Roy do after that?

31:20.542 --> 31:22.125
He went to find Kevin.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.500
Did you see Roy after that?

31:23.583 --> 31:25.625
No, I assumed he did
the gentlemanly thing

31:25.709 --> 31:27.792
and-and transferred routes.

31:27.875 --> 31:31.250
And you blame that on Kevin,
seeing you with Roy?

31:32.709 --> 31:35.208
The only thing that
mattered
was my son.

31:35.291 --> 31:38.083
And I felt like
I lost him that
day.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.375
Where is he now?

31:41.625 --> 31:42.959
I wish I knew.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.667
Got a line on Kevin.
Lives outside of Scranton.

31:46.750 --> 31:47.792
Jeffries is bringing him in.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.875
Diane says her son
caught her with Roy.

31:49.959 --> 31:51.291
Wasn't too happy about it.

31:51.375 --> 31:54.083
Around the same time
Roy disappeared.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.291
His folks finally
just shipped him
off

31:55.375 --> 31:57.333
to Valley
Forge
in the fall.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.500
Military school?

31:59.583 --> 32:00.875
During the Vietnam War?

32:00.959 --> 32:03.500
It's one way to
straighten out a mixed up
kid.

32:03.583 --> 32:05.166
Or get rid
of the big problem.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.959
Parents had good timing, Kevin.

32:20.041 --> 32:23.792
Sent you to military academy at
the height of the Vietnam War.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.500
You know, push-ups
and screaming

32:25.583 --> 32:27.125
that might work
for some kids.

32:27.208 --> 32:31.041
[scoffs]
Not me.
I...I ditched that place.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.000
And before that,
public school.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.333
A school nurse sent you home
with a broken wrist

32:38.417 --> 32:39.917
end of your sophomore year.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.208
June 7, 1967.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.542
Day after,
Roy Dunn disappeared.

32:46.625 --> 32:47.750
Roy Dunn?

32:47.834 --> 32:49.166
A door-to-door salesman.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.208
You remember.
You used to play ball with
him.

32:53.458 --> 32:55.083
Yeah, maybe I did.

32:55.166 --> 32:56.417
What's one got to do
with the other?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.291
How did you break
your wrist, Kevin?

33:00.709 --> 33:02.959
I don't know. I got in
a lot of fights back
then.

33:03.041 --> 33:04.250
Roy one of 'em?

33:04.333 --> 33:06.250
I-I never
had a problem with
Roy.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.000
No?

33:08.083 --> 33:11.166
Not even after you saw
him with your mother?

33:11.250 --> 33:12.417
Oh, we spoke to her.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.500
Said you were pretty upset
about what you saw.

33:15.583 --> 33:16.709
Leave her out of this.

33:16.792 --> 33:18.834
All of sudden
you feel protective?

33:18.917 --> 33:20.041
She's my mother.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.125
When's the last time
you called her?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.250
[chuckles]
What is
this?

33:23.333 --> 33:24.583
Must have had
a good reason to..

33:24.667 --> 33:26.250
...cut her out
of your life like that.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.417
(Vera)
'Like seeing her
with another guy?'

33:29.500 --> 33:32.375
Still disgusts you to think she
was unfaithful to your father.

33:34.250 --> 33:35.583
You got it all wrong.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.041
(Vera)
'You used to lift weights,
Kevin?'

33:38.125 --> 33:40.375
I look like I lift weights?

33:40.458 --> 33:43.667
Past has a way
of gettin'...dredged
up.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.709
Along with Roy's body at the
bottom of that pond in a
park.

33:48.083 --> 33:49.500
Where you two used to play.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.875
I did see Roy
that day I got
hurt

33:52.959 --> 33:54.750
but it wasn't 'cause of him.

33:57.417 --> 33:59.083
I was already a mess.

33:59.166 --> 34:01.709
You don't know what it was
like
living in the middle of that.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.250
Kev!

34:06.333 --> 34:07.208
Kev.

34:07.291 --> 34:09.208
Please. What you saw..

34:11.375 --> 34:12.875
What-what happened to you?

34:14.750 --> 34:16.417
Did you get into
a fight at school?

34:17.291 --> 34:18.333
No.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.792
Lemme see.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.667
Who did this to you?

34:39.125 --> 34:40.792
It was your father,
wasn't it?

34:46.500 --> 34:47.583
Why?

34:48.834 --> 34:49.917
I can't.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.583
You told your father
about Roy and your mom..

34:53.959 --> 34:55.500
...and he took it
out
on the messenger.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.834
Then he went after Roy?

34:58.667 --> 35:01.125
No. That's not what happened.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.834
Then what did happen, Kev?

35:04.667 --> 35:07.333
Nick, uh, why don't you
go get Kevin a soda?

35:23.583 --> 35:27.125
Forty two years is a long
time
to keep a secret.

35:34.041 --> 35:35.750
I didn't know Roy was dead.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.250
What'd you tell him that day?

35:38.333 --> 35:39.625
He wanted to..

35:43.041 --> 35:45.542
...know why my dad hit me.

35:45.625 --> 35:47.000
Why, Kevin?

35:48.834 --> 35:50.291
Because of what I saw.

36:06.583 --> 36:08.083
(Kevin)
'Dad?'

36:14.625 --> 36:16.792
I'll never forget
that look on his face.

36:16.875 --> 36:17.959
You know, he..

36:20.583 --> 36:22.291
I thought
I did something
wrong.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.291
He made you think that.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.458
Old man, he..

36:27.125 --> 36:29.542
He chased me down, he gave me
the beatin' of my life.

36:30.917 --> 36:34.417
He threatened worse
if I said a word to anybody.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.917
But you told Roy?

36:38.291 --> 36:40.125
And Roy went to confront
your father.

36:41.625 --> 36:42.750
A part of me..

36:44.333 --> 36:45.542
...wanted him to..

36:47.166 --> 36:49.417
...take me and my
mother
out of that house.

36:51.291 --> 36:52.500
All she put up with.

36:54.458 --> 36:55.667
Well..

36:55.750 --> 36:57.792
...some people shouldn't
stay together.

36:59.208 --> 37:01.375
Took me a long time
to figure that out.

37:05.041 --> 37:06.834
Still my dad though, you know?

37:20.875 --> 37:22.917
Nice setup you got
here, Glenn.

37:24.792 --> 37:25.875
(Rush)
'Why don't you
put the tools down'

37:25.959 --> 37:28.417
and step away from the bench.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.834
What's going on here?
Did Diane let you in?

37:34.917 --> 37:36.917
You're a real handy guy.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.667
Kept it together
all these years.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.875
Kept what together,
detective?

37:41.959 --> 37:43.166
Appearances.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.959
Why Diane needs
a bottle of wine

37:45.041 --> 37:47.083
to make it through the day.

37:47.166 --> 37:48.834
(Glenn)
'I don't have to stand
here, listen to this.'

37:48.917 --> 37:51.500
Now, you got something you want
to ask me about, ask it.

37:51.583 --> 37:54.542
How 'bout that bunk you fed
us
about being the good father

37:54.625 --> 37:56.291
protecting
your family from
Roy.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.333
- It's a real stumper, Glenn.
- I'd like you to leave now.

37:59.417 --> 38:01.542
You couldn't be happy,
so neither could anyone else.

38:01.625 --> 38:03.333
Smacking your wife around,
beating your kid.

38:03.417 --> 38:06.834
- I never laid a hand on
them.
- Not what Kevin told us.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.500
But Roy knew
what you did to him.

38:09.583 --> 38:10.834
And why.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.834
You still hitting the
park
after hours, Glenn?

38:12.917 --> 38:14.291
Maybe you got
too old for
that?

38:14.375 --> 38:16.834
Or maybe you got
a toe-tapping thing
going

38:16.917 --> 38:18.458
at the airport
men's room now?

38:18.542 --> 38:19.959
This is ridiculous.
I'm not the criminal here.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.625
We're cops, Glenn.
You don't think we know

38:21.709 --> 38:24.291
what all the loitering
tickets
at Judy Garland Park mean?

38:26.417 --> 38:29.041
You're, you're twisting
things around.

38:29.125 --> 38:30.709
You did a pretty good
job
of that yourself.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.041
But Roy could tell.
He had that eye.

38:33.125 --> 38:34.583
Saw right through you.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.875
Confronted you.
But you couldn't handle
it.

38:36.959 --> 38:39.917
Made Roy out to be
the monster, but it was you.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.333
Wasn't it, Glenn?

38:41.417 --> 38:43.333
He had no right.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.083
Was still my house.

38:45.166 --> 38:47.208
My house! My family!

38:47.291 --> 38:48.875
I was a good father.

39:03.792 --> 39:04.959
I saw Kevin.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.875
Get the hell out of here.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.041
I'm not going anywhere.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.834
You're trespassing.
You want me to call the
police?

39:19.917 --> 39:24.083
Go ahead. They might like to
hear what you did to Kevin.

39:24.166 --> 39:25.166
What are you talking about?

39:25.250 --> 39:26.709
Shouldn't have hit him, Glenn.

39:28.458 --> 39:30.667
Kevin is all mixed up.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.333
That why you busted his arm?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.166
I went away
for a long time, Glenn.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.041
Learned to keep my mouth shut
and look the other way.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.959
I'm done doing that now.

39:44.041 --> 39:47.166
And you're done bullying
Kevin and Diane.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.583
Who the hell are you to tell
me
how to run my family?

39:50.667 --> 39:53.333
Some nobody salesman.

39:57.875 --> 40:01.709
It's over, Glenn.
I know about the
park.

40:01.792 --> 40:03.458
What? You don't know
what you're talking about.

40:03.542 --> 40:06.291
Can't even admit who you
are,
so you take it out on them.

40:06.375 --> 40:07.834
- You shut your mouth.
- You need to leave, Glenn.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.208
Right now.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.667
Let Diane and
Kevin
live their lives.

40:14.709 --> 40:18.458
I will do no such thing.

40:24.583 --> 40:25.834
You don't deserve them.
