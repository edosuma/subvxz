08:58.113 --> 08:59.612
-You want to go play some cards?
Come on.
-Yeah.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.431
-Let's all go play some cards.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:01.433 --> 09:02.356
Not a bad idea.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.167
(grunts)

09:05.546 --> 09:06.895
PHILLIP: South Bay.
MARGARET: Let's all go

09:06.955 --> 09:08.438
beat their socks off.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.201
things are complicated at home.

09:14.296 --> 09:15.554
He...

09:15.705 --> 09:16.721
threatened to kill me.

09:16.873 --> 09:18.706

Darn it.

(scrubbing sounds)

09:27.734 --> 09:28.474
Oh, hey.

09:28.627 --> 09:29.884
Do you want coffee or tea?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.278
-I have...
-Hey, Ma-Maddie, stop.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.054
What are you doing?

09:33.890 --> 09:36.149
-I'm getting
the after-dinner drinks ready.
-No.

09:36.301 --> 09:37.892
What are you doing with Doug?
He's not a good guy.

09:38.653 --> 09:41.204
What are you talking about?
Everything's fine.

09:46.069 --> 09:48.086
(sighs)
This is not fine, Maddie.

09:48.163 --> 09:48.995
It happened at work. I...

09:49.089 --> 09:50.480
hit it on a gurney.

09:50.498 --> 09:53.091
Oh, really? Since when
do gurneys have fingers?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.909
It was an accident.

09:54.986 --> 09:55.927
No.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.262
No, that's what
you used to say before.

09:57.489 --> 09:58.746
I missed the signs last time.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.839
I'm not doing that again.

09:59.991 --> 10:01.491
Wh-What do you mean, "again"?

10:01.509 --> 10:04.494
I know
that you want to leave him,

10:04.587 --> 10:05.845
but y-you're too afraid to try.

10:05.997 --> 10:07.847
I know that you don't think
you're strong enough.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.608
But that's not true, Maddie.
You are.

10:09.793 --> 10:10.758
You're stronger than you know,

10:10.852 --> 10:12.235
and I can help you.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.113
Maddie. Hey, hey,
wh-where are you going?

10:15.264 --> 10:16.673
I am going to get an aspirin,

10:16.842 --> 10:19.326
because this conversation's
giving me a headache.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.287
If I have to listen to him
for another second,

10:22.438 --> 10:24.030
I think my head's gonna explode.

10:24.182 --> 10:25.531
(coffee pouring)

10:25.684 --> 10:27.459
Hey, what-what's the deal
with them?

10:27.610 --> 10:30.036
Have you noticed anything...
(inhales sharply)

10:30.130 --> 10:32.780
...weird lately?
Any-any kind of issues?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.874
With Maddie and Doug?

10:34.951 --> 10:36.784
I don't know. I try to butt out.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.586
You might want to try it.

10:39.622 --> 10:42.215
Yeah.
I can't stick around for this.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.551
Starting to feel
like I'm living in a nightmare.

10:45.628 --> 10:48.355
Was life feeling
like a dream before?

10:49.465 --> 10:51.207
Hey, if-if...

10:51.300 --> 10:53.376
if someone was, uh...

10:53.378 --> 10:55.528
if someone was in a coma...

10:56.381 --> 10:58.047
...could they have dreams?

10:58.066 --> 10:59.282
Theoretically.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.718
Uh, I don't know.

11:01.736 --> 11:04.079
I've never been in a coma.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.207
Do you need a lift home?

11:08.669 --> 11:10.317
Actually, uh, ca...

11:10.486 --> 11:12.912
can you take me someplace else?

11:13.064 --> 11:14.631
Chimney!

11:19.162 --> 11:21.070
after the car accident,
do you remember

11:21.164 --> 11:22.496
if you had any dreams?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.515
I'm sorry, who are you?

11:23.666 --> 11:25.425
Right. You-you,
you don't know me here.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.427
Um, hi, I-I'm Buck.

11:27.579 --> 11:28.578
We're-we're friends.

11:28.596 --> 11:29.854
And yet,
I've never seen you before.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.916
Look, I know
I-I might sound crazy.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.918
I think I got hurt on the job

11:35.011 --> 11:36.586
and now I'm trapped in some kind

11:36.604 --> 11:39.030
of alternate universe
coma fever dream.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.757
-And I need your help.
-Okay.

11:40.775 --> 11:43.276
Why don't you wait right here,
and I'll go call someone.

11:43.428 --> 11:44.869
-Like the police.
-Wait!

11:45.096 --> 11:47.539
Hey, I-I-I can prove
that I know you.

11:47.766 --> 11:49.766
CHIMNEY:
How?

11:50.544 --> 11:52.618
I know why
they call you Chimney.

11:52.771 --> 11:55.288
(locks clicking)

11:55.382 --> 11:58.216
The last thing I remember is

11:58.367 --> 12:00.293
we were at this apartment fire.

12:00.462 --> 12:01.720
It was raining.

12:01.796 --> 12:03.388
I went up the ladder and...

12:03.539 --> 12:04.614
there was a giant flash.

12:04.707 --> 12:06.299
Sounds like you were
struck by lightning.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.209
Yeah, but I don't think
I'm dead.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.119

around an alternate universe

13:02.431 --> 13:04.115

13:04.267 --> 13:05.432
starting to ask questions?

Well, it was
kind of nice at first, uh...

13:07.846 --> 13:09.178
till this thing with my sister.

13:09.272 --> 13:10.513
Wait, maybe that's it.

13:10.532 --> 13:11.956
Maybe that's the thing

No. (chuckles)

13:16.463 --> 13:17.611

Actually, she's with you.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.874
-Wait, I'm married
to your sister?
-You're not married.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.376
Although you really should be.

13:23.528 --> 13:25.711
Uh, you guys have a kid,
you have a house.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.697
I mean, what else
are you waiting for?

13:27.790 --> 13:29.641
Okay, look, Coma Kid,

13:29.792 --> 13:31.200
I don't even know your sister.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.553
And this has been entertaining
for a minute, but I think

13:33.647 --> 13:35.872
it's time for you
to take your show on the road.

13:35.965 --> 13:37.723
Yeah, I, uh,
I think you're right.

13:37.876 --> 13:39.466
This has not been helpful.

13:39.561 --> 13:42.228
I should've gone to Cap.
Cap will know what to do.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.988
Cap?

13:44.140 --> 13:46.115
Uh, yeah, Bobby.

13:47.143 --> 13:48.568
Captain Bobby Nash.

Uh...

13:50.497 --> 13:51.979
I'm sorry, but, uh,

13:51.998 --> 13:54.240
I got some really bad news
for you.

13:54.392 --> 13:57.085
Captain Bobby Nash,
he died five years ago.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.171
What?

Yeah.

14:11.576 --> 14:12.600
Whoa.

14:13.912 --> 14:16.003
Try to calm down!
Try to breathe!

14:17.432 --> 14:19.274

14:21.269 --> 14:23.194
CHIMNEY:
He can't breathe!

14:29.260 --> 14:31.611
I can swing by the hospital
after class.

14:31.763 --> 14:32.853
Maybe bring dinner.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.355
Yeah, everyone would
appreciate that.

14:34.449 --> 14:37.524
They've all been practically
living in that waiting room.

14:37.619 --> 14:39.360
How's Bobby holding up?

14:39.528 --> 14:41.938
Oh... not great.

14:41.956 --> 14:44.440
I'm pretty sure
he blames himself.

14:44.459 --> 14:45.274
For what?

14:45.326 --> 14:46.551
Buck got struck by lightning.

14:46.736 --> 14:48.720
It was a literal
random act of nature.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.371
A one-in-a-million chance.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.373
It was completely
out of Bobby's control.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.300
Well, try telling him that.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.043
He still won't believe you.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.380
He's always gonna feel
responsible for his team.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.274
Especially Buck.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.963
(sighs)

15:07.098 --> 15:08.147
I just...

15:08.391 --> 15:11.117
I wish there was something
more I could do to help.

15:15.807 --> 15:18.416
I'm pretty sure
that just seeing your face

15:18.567 --> 15:20.493
will be enough.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.980
He's always everyone else's
shoulder to lean on,

15:23.998 --> 15:27.050
but even the strong
snap eventually.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.764
Do you think
Buck's gonna be okay?

15:32.933 --> 15:36.434
I mean, after everything
that happened with Wendall,

15:36.585 --> 15:39.253
I'm not sure Bobby could
take another loss.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.565
Buck is going to be fine.

15:43.501 --> 15:45.526
He has to be.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.952
CHIMNEY:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
We need someone in here!

15:54.103 --> 15:56.012
His oxygen levels
are plummeting.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.346
NURSE:
I'll page Dr. Becker.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.182
<i> NURSE 2:</i>
<i> He's not responding!</i>

15:59.200 --> 16:00.625

16:00.776 --> 16:01.960
What's wrong with him?

16:02.111 --> 16:03.444
Why didn't you call 911?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.112
CHIMNEY: Because he wouldn't
let me, so I called you.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.539
DOCTOR: Even with
the ventilator, he's not getting

16:06.633 --> 16:10.042
enough oxygen.
He's barely satting at 90.

16:10.195 --> 16:11.544
CHIMNEY: Maybe he's just having
a panic attack.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.212
DOCTOR: His peak pressures
are through the roof

16:13.364 --> 16:14.455
and I'm hearing
almost no air movement.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.048
I'm gonna take him off
and bag him.

16:16.201 --> 16:18.142
We're almost there.
Stay on the bag.

16:18.294 --> 16:20.052
Hey, buddy, can you hear me?

<i> PHILLIP:</i>
<i> Did his heart stop again?</i>

16:21.964 --> 16:24.056
No, it's his lungs.

Good work, everyone.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.996
(music playing quietly)

16:39.724 --> 16:40.832
Huh.

16:41.059 --> 16:42.649
Or maybe he's pulling our legs.

16:42.744 --> 16:43.909
He's fine.

16:44.062 --> 16:45.745
Sorry, I-I don't know
what happened.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.323
It was like all of a sudden my,
my lungs just stopped working.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.491
And now?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.251
Uh, yeah, no.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.679
(stammers)
I feel better.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.998
CHIMNEY:
They put him on ECMO.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.684
Give his lungs a chance to heal.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.019
I thought they were worried

17:01.246 --> 17:03.003
about the lightning
damaging his heart.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.355
Well, they're worried
about his lungs.

17:04.507 --> 17:06.357
Doctor said the force
from the lightning

17:06.584 --> 17:08.434
caused a pulmonary contusion.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.010
ALBERT:
That sounds pretty serious.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.031
How long does
he have to stay on it?

17:13.182 --> 17:15.015
A couple days, at least.

17:15.109 --> 17:18.094
The hope is
that his oxygen levels

17:18.187 --> 17:19.445
will increase high enough,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.205
hopefully they can
take him off sedation.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.666
And then he'll be okay?

17:25.286 --> 17:28.379
We won't know until
they try to take him off of it.

17:28.456 --> 17:30.381
See if he can
breathe on his own.

17:30.491 --> 17:33.009
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

17:34.504 --> 17:36.796
Maddie, uh...

17:36.890 --> 17:38.705
-took her parents home?
-Yeah.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.208
She and Philip practically had
to drag Margaret out of here.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.728
For a minute, I thought they
were gonna have to sedate her.

17:43.879 --> 17:45.805
Yeah, it must be hard for them.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.048
-Seeing Buck like this, just...
-Yeah.

17:48.142 --> 17:49.959
Your kid almost dying

17:49.977 --> 17:51.627
is probably easier to handle

17:51.720 --> 17:53.220
when you're thousands
of miles away.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.907
Howie, they're trying.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.576
So is Dad.

17:58.803 --> 18:00.727
You know, people always tell me

18:00.822 --> 18:03.806
you'll understand your parents
better once you become a parent.

18:03.825 --> 18:05.732
Well, I'm a parent now.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.144
And I understand him even less.

18:08.162 --> 18:10.313
There's nothing I wouldn't do

18:10.331 --> 18:12.148
for Jee-Yun to see her happy.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.134
They ran out of oat milk.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.007
Chim, go home.
It's not gonna do Buck any good

18:22.102 --> 18:23.935
for you to end up in bed
next to him.

18:24.086 --> 18:24.918
Pace yourself.

18:25.012 --> 18:27.230
So who's gonna tell him that?

18:28.833 --> 18:30.942
<i> He was asking</i>
<i> about Captain Nash.</i>

18:31.093 --> 18:32.351
That's what
brought all this on.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.502
BUCK:
So what happened to him?

18:33.671 --> 18:34.761
Was it on the job?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.114
It was the alcohol.

18:36.265 --> 18:38.524
No, that's not possible.
He was in recovery.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.675
He took it very seriously.

18:39.694 --> 18:41.677
HEN:
Maybe he was before, but

18:41.696 --> 18:44.013
there was this plane crash.

18:44.031 --> 18:45.915
Flight LB46.

18:47.109 --> 18:49.443
-Told you.
-The next day he didn't show up

18:49.462 --> 18:52.279
for work, so you went over
to check on him.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.133
I was with you in my other life.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.635
No, not in any life.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.470
Captain Nash was a quiet guy.

18:59.697 --> 19:01.455
He kept to himself.
I didn't even know

19:01.474 --> 19:03.215
he was suffering
until it was too late.

19:03.368 --> 19:05.810
Why am I even having this
conversation with this person?

19:05.961 --> 19:08.688
See?
The crazy just sucks you in.

19:08.797 --> 19:11.040
Hold on, the day of the crash,

19:11.058 --> 19:12.132
Bobby kind of lost it.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.135
-What do you mean? Lost it how?
-Well,

19:15.229 --> 19:19.732
<i> I made him mad and he</i>
<i> shoved me up against the wall.</i>

19:19.808 --> 19:20.900
Captain Nash shoved you?

19:21.027 --> 19:22.326
HEN:
Okay, if I'd seen that,

19:22.478 --> 19:24.996
I would have known
something was wrong.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.498
My not being at the 118 is what
pushed him over the edge.

19:27.725 --> 19:30.242
Or maybe it was just
some random butterfly effect

19:30.336 --> 19:33.713
and the entire world
doesn't revolve around you.

19:34.565 --> 19:36.248
Eddie Diaz.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.249
Army vet,

19:37.402 --> 19:38.751
came from Texas, joined the 118

19:38.903 --> 19:41.404
-right before
the big earthquake.
-Angry guy.

19:41.422 --> 19:43.330
Hey, you'd be angry, too,
if you lost your kid.

19:43.424 --> 19:45.591
I mean, you'd have
to stop being a kid first

19:45.685 --> 19:46.909
and then have one but...

19:46.928 --> 19:47.852
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean "lost"?

19:48.003 --> 19:49.745
What happened to Christopher?

19:49.838 --> 19:51.263
His grandparents
took him to Texas.

19:51.432 --> 19:53.749
After a nasty custody battle.

19:53.768 --> 19:56.101
They said Diaz was unfit.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.103
That he couldn't
be a firefighter

19:58.198 --> 19:59.697
and a single dad.

19:59.848 --> 20:02.700
He tried to bring him
to the firehouse a few times,

20:02.927 --> 20:05.852
-but Captain Righetti said no.
<i> -BUCK: Eddie.</i>

20:05.872 --> 20:08.188
This-this is my friend Carla.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.766
-Nice to meet you, Eddie.
<i> -BUCK: Carla.</i>

20:10.859 --> 20:13.336
He never met Carla.

20:15.957 --> 20:18.532
I'm sorry, but he insisted
on coming here.

20:18.626 --> 20:20.200
I need to see Buck.

20:20.278 --> 20:21.460
I have to talk to him.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.463
You know they don't
let kids in the ICU.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.224
I don't care.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.309
Maybe we can find a work-around.

20:32.457 --> 20:35.566
Excuse me.
How you doing?

20:35.793 --> 20:37.401
I was wondering if you knew
of any job opportunities

20:37.628 --> 20:40.129
in this hospital?
I'm a home health caregiver and

20:40.147 --> 20:43.157
I'm thinking about transitioning
back into the field.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.804
Christopher?

20:48.823 --> 20:50.539
I couldn't tell him no.

20:51.809 --> 20:53.084
Is he sleeping?

20:53.235 --> 20:56.069
EDDIE:
Something like that.
He's resting.

20:56.163 --> 20:58.071
So the machines
can do all the work.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.648
Make him feel better.

20:59.742 --> 21:01.166
What are all these tubes?

21:01.261 --> 21:03.819
That's part of the ECMO machine.

21:03.838 --> 21:07.080
It takes his blood
and puts extra oxygen in it.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.934
And then that blood
goes back into his body.

21:10.011 --> 21:11.435
Can he hear me?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.512
I bet he can.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.439
Hey, Buck.

21:15.666 --> 21:16.832
It's Christopher.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.517
I know you're sick,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.569
but it's only temporary.

21:22.189 --> 21:23.948
You're gonna be okay.

21:24.099 --> 21:26.617
That's what
all the machines are doing.

21:26.694 --> 21:28.677
Making you better.

21:28.771 --> 21:30.771
But wherever you are,

21:30.865 --> 21:32.698
you have to come back.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.683
Wherever you are right now,

21:34.777 --> 21:37.128
you have to come back.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.782
-Tell me again why we're here.
-I'm not sure.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.134
I think maybe
I'm supposed to come

21:43.361 --> 21:44.451
back to where it all started.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.195
I guess that makes sense
in the rules

21:46.213 --> 21:47.713
of this alternate universe.

21:47.865 --> 21:50.215
I-I have this weird feeling
like I'm running out of time.

21:50.368 --> 21:52.201
Ooh, a ticking clock.
Plot twist.

21:52.294 --> 21:54.553
You were having trouble
breathing before, right?

21:54.705 --> 21:57.556
-Yeah.
-What if that wasn't
a panic attack?

21:57.708 --> 21:58.724
You guys are talking about

21:58.876 --> 22:00.634
this place
as an alternate reality.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.061
But it's not.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.154
If you're in a coma,

22:03.381 --> 22:05.381
then this is all in your head.

22:05.474 --> 22:08.050
Meaning this place is still
connected to that body.

22:08.219 --> 22:10.219
If it can't breathe,
you can't breathe.

22:10.312 --> 22:11.737
So he feels like he's
running out of time...

22:11.889 --> 22:15.124
Because my body is.

22:26.253 --> 22:27.178
Eat.

22:27.329 --> 22:28.679
May, I'm just not hungry.

22:28.831 --> 22:30.514
If you can tell me
the last time you ate something

22:30.666 --> 22:33.166
other than an energy bar,
I'll leave you alone.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.911
You know you're really starting
to remind me of someone?

22:35.930 --> 22:37.730
Do not say it.

22:38.599 --> 22:40.524
Thanks.

22:46.014 --> 22:48.424
Any updates from the doctors?

22:48.517 --> 22:50.593
No, nothing yet.

22:50.611 --> 22:52.595
Buck is still
hooked up to the ECMO.

22:52.688 --> 22:55.280
They're gonna reassess
later tonight, but...

22:55.357 --> 22:57.708
for now it's just wait and see.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.378
I know that
must be hard for you.

23:00.529 --> 23:01.212
Hmm?

23:01.439 --> 23:03.939
Not being able to do something.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.198
Mm. Yep.

23:05.292 --> 23:06.550
Especially since it's Buck.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.554
Come on. Mom brought
two kids into the marriage.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.181
You brought one.

23:13.634 --> 23:16.018
Yeah, I suppose so.

23:17.638 --> 23:19.638
That's a good kid.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.716
You're always talking
about how stubborn he is.

23:23.477 --> 23:25.736
How he never knows
when to leave well enough alone.

23:27.982 --> 23:30.282
So he's gonna find his way
back to us.

23:31.393 --> 23:32.985
Yeah.

23:33.137 --> 23:35.304
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

23:35.322 --> 23:36.997
And you're gonna be okay.

23:38.476 --> 23:40.584
I love you.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.257
I love you too, May.

23:49.745 --> 23:51.244
BECKER:
Looks like the ECMO worked.

23:51.264 --> 23:54.156
His oxygen level has improved
enough to take him off of it.

23:54.175 --> 23:55.749
That's good news, right?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.326
He's not in the clear yet.

23:57.344 --> 23:58.769
It still remains to be seen

23:58.921 --> 24:00.846
if your son can breathe
on his own.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.440
So what's next?

24:02.591 --> 24:04.516
We're gonna lower
his level of sedation

24:04.610 --> 24:06.944
and then unhook him
from the ventilator.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.613
And what happens if he can't
breathe on his own?

24:09.765 --> 24:13.025
Let's see what he does
before we go down that road.

24:13.177 --> 24:14.693
The machine did its job.

24:14.845 --> 24:17.329
Now the rest is up to your son.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.296
I didn't find anything.

24:25.447 --> 24:26.630
Neither did we.

24:26.782 --> 24:29.024
Probably 'cause
we didn't know what the hell

24:29.043 --> 24:31.284
-we were looking for.
-I think maybe

24:31.378 --> 24:34.196
we're supposed to be looking for
something that doesn't belong.

24:34.215 --> 24:36.015
You mean like that.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.732
I don't know why that's there.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.652
You're looking for answers.

24:48.804 --> 24:50.879
Maybe that's a clue
to where you'll find them.

24:50.898 --> 24:52.823
What if the plane
isn't just a plane?

24:52.975 --> 24:55.050
What if it represents something?

24:55.069 --> 24:57.402
Bobby!
I told you to leave, Bobby, now!

24:57.497 --> 24:59.163
You know
I'm a terrible listener.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.750
Or someone.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.171
Thank you, guys.
I-I got to go.

25:08.566 --> 25:11.300
Hey, hey, wait up!

25:23.931 --> 25:25.914
♪ ♪

25:25.933 --> 25:27.691
(clattering)

25:52.534 --> 25:55.535
Oh. Hey, kid.
Fancy meeting you here.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.779
Thought you were dead.

25:56.797 --> 25:58.371
What are you doing here?

25:58.391 --> 25:59.723
You tell me.
It's your dream.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.207
I'm just living in it.

26:01.302 --> 26:03.209
Living my best afterlife.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.044
Uh-huh.

26:04.212 --> 26:05.971
So I am dead.

26:06.140 --> 26:07.790
Close, but not quite.

26:07.808 --> 26:09.792
Hey, what do you think these do?

26:09.885 --> 26:11.217
-(rattling)
-Mmm.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.295
This place is way too messed-up

26:13.314 --> 26:14.813
to be heaven, but, uh,

26:14.982 --> 26:17.299
I don't really believe in hell.

26:17.392 --> 26:18.150
I...

26:18.302 --> 26:19.726
I'm in purgatory.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.637
I never really understood
the concept of this.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.138
Is th-is this a waiting room,

26:23.157 --> 26:25.749
do I just have to hang here
until my number is called

26:25.976 --> 26:28.419
or is it, like, a-a punishment,

26:28.646 --> 26:30.662
a time-out-- do I have to do
some type of penance

26:30.756 --> 26:32.631
before I'm allowed to move on?

26:33.500 --> 26:34.741
Listen, kid.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.577
You need to relax.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.680
None of this is real.

26:41.008 --> 26:43.559
Ah.
That's the good news.

26:44.829 --> 26:46.511
The bad news is it can

26:46.664 --> 26:49.181
be real enough
to keep you here if you let it.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.067
Uh, wh-what do you mean?

26:55.564 --> 26:57.189
Hey.

26:57.341 --> 26:59.241
Look, you're alive.

27:01.345 --> 27:02.602
And there's me.

27:02.696 --> 27:06.531
Ooh, I busted out the
rosary beads. Must be serious.

27:06.684 --> 27:08.751
(muttering)

27:12.690 --> 27:14.965
How am I there and here?

27:15.192 --> 27:17.468
Well, Evan Buckley, this
is your deep, dark subconscious.

27:17.695 --> 27:18.802
(door closes)

27:18.954 --> 27:20.712
-Here you go, darling.
-Oh, hey,

27:20.789 --> 27:22.455
can we back up for a second.
Are you telling me

27:22.549 --> 27:23.807
that's my wife?
I mean, some things

27:23.959 --> 27:25.309
did work out for me,
didn't they?

27:25.536 --> 27:28.562
Do-do you know what's
happening to me in there?

27:29.798 --> 27:31.798
Depends on how you look at it.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.726
You could be dying, you could be
fighting for your life.

27:34.895 --> 27:37.062
It's kind of up to you.

27:37.214 --> 27:39.548
Which way you leaning?

27:39.641 --> 27:41.492
I don't know.

27:41.643 --> 27:43.994
This felt pretty great
at first, but...

27:44.146 --> 27:46.146
then the Doug thing,
now the you thing.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.648
Well, don't think
you can bring me

27:48.784 --> 27:50.817
back from the dead even in here.

27:50.911 --> 27:52.819
But...

27:52.946 --> 27:54.988
I think you can
fix the Doug thing.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.582
All you have to do
is introduce Maddie to Chimney

27:57.677 --> 27:59.343
-and then let nature
take its course.
-W-W...

27:59.494 --> 28:01.737
-Would-would that work?
-I don't know.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.405
I'm not exactly bound
by the laws of physics

28:03.498 --> 28:06.433
and logic in here.
I know what you know.

28:07.261 --> 28:08.593
You know, it's funny, uh...

28:08.746 --> 28:11.580
my whole life,
my parents never really saw me

28:11.598 --> 28:14.266
'cause they were so caught up
in their own grief.

28:14.418 --> 28:17.477
It felt like I was an annoyance
they had to deal with.

28:17.512 --> 28:19.271
But-but here--

28:19.423 --> 28:22.274
here, they finally
see me the way

28:22.426 --> 28:25.494
I always wanted to be seen.

28:27.097 --> 28:28.872
I matter here.

28:29.099 --> 28:31.191
No, kid.

28:31.285 --> 28:32.859
If what matters to you most

28:32.878 --> 28:35.370
is how other people see you...

28:36.531 --> 28:39.258
...then you haven't
learned a damn thing.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.286
(monitor beeping steadily)

28:51.305 --> 28:53.046
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

28:53.140 --> 28:55.065
(door opens)

28:58.053 --> 29:00.553
Bobby, it's time.

29:00.647 --> 29:02.990
Go take a break.

29:19.407 --> 29:21.967
(door closes)

29:29.359 --> 29:32.269
I don't know if you can
hear me, Evan Buckley.

29:33.105 --> 29:37.015
But I do know that
you never give up.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.276
So don't start now.

29:40.187 --> 29:42.279
That man has lost

29:42.430 --> 29:44.114
two children.

29:44.266 --> 29:47.201
He cannot survive losing you.

29:48.028 --> 29:49.936
So wake up, damn it.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.623
<i> -Wake up.</i>
-Yeah, I-I'm trying.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.774
Just need to figure out

29:54.868 --> 29:56.293
what to fix to get back.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.828
Maybe you should just give up.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.688
Did you know
you were clinically dead

29:59.706 --> 30:01.690
for three minutes? Things aren't
looking good for you.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.708
How come you're such a jerk
in this reality?

30:03.785 --> 30:05.618
Because I am losing patience.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.138
When are you gonna learn?
Brothers die, children

30:08.290 --> 30:11.124
and wives die, sisters
get beat up by their husbands.

30:11.218 --> 30:13.310
-You can't fix everything.
-You know what,

30:13.537 --> 30:14.536
well, I fixed you.

30:14.555 --> 30:16.730
Oh, really? How?

30:18.341 --> 30:20.208
'Cause I joined the 118.

30:20.302 --> 30:22.561
Well, welcome to the 118, Buck.

30:22.713 --> 30:23.487
Thank you.

30:23.638 --> 30:24.637
<i> And I made you mad.</i>

30:24.806 --> 30:27.157
<i> And I made you cry.</i>

30:27.309 --> 30:29.718
<i> I made you laugh</i>
<i> sometimes, you know?</i>

30:29.811 --> 30:30.886
I drove you crazy, but I think

30:30.979 --> 30:32.387
<i> you spent so much time</i>

30:32.406 --> 30:35.315
<i> trying to make sure that</i>
<i> I didn't get myself killed</i>

30:35.409 --> 30:36.408
<i> that it made you remember</i>

30:36.502 --> 30:38.785
what it is to live.

30:38.896 --> 30:39.895
("Fix You" by Coldplay playing)

30:39.913 --> 30:42.673
So, basically, you were Buck.

30:42.824 --> 30:45.342
Yeah.
I was Buck.

30:45.569 --> 30:47.052
And that's enough?

30:50.665 --> 30:52.257
I think it is.

30:52.409 --> 30:54.593
Sounds like someone
just figured out

30:54.687 --> 30:57.062
the answers for himself.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.525
Go.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.604
Sweet kid.

31:05.772 --> 31:06.922
Hey, man,
I just met your sister.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.348
-She's kind of awesome.
-Great,

31:08.442 --> 31:09.774
-that's great.
-Why don't you come with me?

31:09.927 --> 31:11.443
I think we can convince her
to leave that Doug guy.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.744
Maybe later!

31:14.765 --> 31:16.615
Can you help me find my dad?

31:16.709 --> 31:20.043
Sorry, but you're not real
and I got to go.

31:20.270 --> 31:22.588
I'm always gonna feel guilty
for that one.

31:31.298 --> 31:33.298
Oh, come on, not again.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.475
Where do you think you're going?

31:37.621 --> 31:39.730
Home.

31:40.624 --> 31:42.048
I can't stay here.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.051
Evan, please don't go.

31:46.130 --> 31:49.131
We know we haven't
always been there for you,

31:49.149 --> 31:51.650
but we're here now.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.318
Let us make it up to you.

31:53.487 --> 31:56.138
We will spend
the rest of this life

31:56.156 --> 31:59.082
making up for everything
we didn't do in the other.

31:59.309 --> 32:02.127
You don't have to do that.

32:03.571 --> 32:06.572
I know you did
the best you could.

32:06.667 --> 32:10.177
And I will always love you
no matter what.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.672

It can be anything

33:05.133 --> 33:06.650

33:06.877 --> 33:09.194

33:10.547 --> 33:12.230
I do have a family.

33:12.399 --> 33:14.741
Not the same one I have here.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.036
But one that needs me.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.055
DANIEL:
Do they?

33:20.073 --> 33:21.647
Daniel, stop doing this.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.983
Okay? I have to get back
before it's too late.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.651
It's already too late.

33:25.729 --> 33:27.562
That real world family--

33:27.655 --> 33:29.231
they've given up on you.

33:31.568 --> 33:33.084
N-No, no, that...

33:33.237 --> 33:34.660
that's not what's happening.

33:34.755 --> 33:36.738
DANIEL:
Oh, they're just
waiting for you to die

33:36.831 --> 33:39.182
so they can move on
with their lives without you.

33:39.259 --> 33:41.409
They wouldn't do that.

33:41.411 --> 33:42.761
And yet...

33:42.913 --> 33:45.171
BECKER:
And now we wait.

33:45.265 --> 33:48.083
See if he takes
a spontaneous breath on his own.

33:48.176 --> 33:50.435
DANIEL:
They don't care about you.

33:50.587 --> 33:51.862
Why would they?

33:52.089 --> 33:53.196
You're not good enough.
Never have been.

33:53.423 --> 33:54.531
The only reason
you were even born

33:54.682 --> 33:56.867
was for spare parts,
and they were defective.

33:57.094 --> 33:58.351
Wasn't my fault.

33:58.445 --> 33:59.427
We both know

33:59.488 --> 34:02.164
you don't really believe that.

34:07.195 --> 34:08.694
His oxygen is dropping.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.213
If he doesn't take a breath
in the next few seconds,

34:10.365 --> 34:14.217
we're gonna have to
reconnect him to the ventilator.

Right, uh, this,

34:17.205 --> 34:19.539

happening inside my head,

34:19.633 --> 34:22.634

to myself the whole time.

Hmm? Upside-- uh,

34:24.304 --> 34:27.981
I don't have to feel bad about
not listening to you anymore.

34:29.476 --> 34:30.901
What are you doing?

34:31.052 --> 34:33.295
I have to get back.
I'm running out of time!

34:33.388 --> 34:35.814
It's impossible.
There is no way in there.

34:35.966 --> 34:37.966
You're stuck here with me.

34:38.059 --> 34:40.302
It's not impossible!
There is not

34:40.320 --> 34:42.412
a locked room anywhere that,
with the right tools

34:42.564 --> 34:44.730
and enough time,
you can't break into.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.249
I know that.

34:46.401 --> 34:47.733
(chuckles)

34:47.828 --> 34:49.494
'Cause I'm a firefighter.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.737
There's nothing for you
in that room.

34:51.832 --> 34:53.590
No one in there needs you.

34:53.817 --> 34:55.317
I'm not going back for them.

34:55.319 --> 34:57.094
I'm going back for me.

I have to say, it-it felt good
to have them care.

36:51.435 --> 36:53.526
Well, they seemed to care
a lot out here, too.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.879
They were pretty worried
about you. We all were.

36:56.106 --> 36:57.214

Just do.

still Bobby, actually.

37:26.653 --> 37:28.486
Uh, you helped me

figure some things out

37:29.806 --> 37:32.749
-and find my way home.
-Good.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.443
Though I still find it hard
to believe that you voluntarily

37:35.445 --> 37:38.088
left a world where
you could fix everything.

37:39.407 --> 37:40.740
Not everything.

37:40.908 --> 37:42.000
Nah.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.593
Trust me, it's...

37:43.762 --> 37:46.054
it's better here.

in the hospital.

a bit of a potluck.

38:18.946 --> 38:21.205
Well, it smells delicious.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.133
I'm sorry that
it's taking so long.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.303

than I thought.

38:28.623 --> 38:31.141

with Jee-Yun.

38:34.128 --> 38:37.071
Yeah, and I think
she's really enjoying

38:37.073 --> 38:39.691
being spoiled
by her grandparents.

38:41.545 --> 38:43.878
He's sorry.

38:43.897 --> 38:45.229
Your father.

38:46.307 --> 38:47.549
Myung, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

38:47.567 --> 38:49.326
-but you don't have to.
-His staying away

38:49.553 --> 38:51.811
-had nothing to do with you.
-Really?

38:51.830 --> 38:54.331
'Cause I felt like it did.

38:54.558 --> 38:55.481
He was ashamed.

38:55.559 --> 38:56.499
He was a failure.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.560
That's why he could
never bring himself

38:58.653 --> 38:59.727
to come here.

38:59.821 --> 39:00.912
Failure how?

39:01.081 --> 39:03.581
He runs one the biggest
tech companies in Seoul.

39:03.733 --> 39:05.400
Not in Korea.

39:05.418 --> 39:07.402
Here.

39:07.495 --> 39:11.330
Everything in this country
represents

39:11.499 --> 39:12.849
-a failure for him.
-Right.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.093
He couldn't make
his business successful.

39:15.245 --> 39:16.669
He couldn't save his marriage

39:16.763 --> 39:20.582
and he couldn't convince you
to come back to Korea with him

39:20.675 --> 39:22.609
after your mother died.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.700
I didn't know that.

39:30.852 --> 39:33.111
Your father is not a mean man

39:33.263 --> 39:35.096
but a proud man.

39:35.115 --> 39:37.115
And often...

39:37.267 --> 39:40.210
the pride gets in the way
of what is important.

39:40.361 --> 39:44.130
I think you might
have that in common.

called you Pop Pop.

More importantly...

40:08.632 --> 40:10.055
she thinks I'm funny.

40:10.150 --> 40:12.075
Yeah, I guess
that's what grandads are for.

40:12.226 --> 40:15.653

There's plenty.

it's our last night.

40:20.234 --> 40:22.585
