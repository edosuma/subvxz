00:04.045 --> 00:08.216
15 masters and apprentices
were battling it out

00:11.010 --> 00:12.470
In the flash challenge,

at each other's throats.

As a self-described tattoo god,
I think that I understand

He just took out my mentor.

This is so [bleep] wet.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.994
{\an3}I can't gold leaf
over any wet paint.

on me and Tyler.

Enraged the artist.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.934
I hate not having enough time
to, like, get something drawn

01:00.018 --> 01:00.977
that I like.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.479
There's no crying

battle against me, then go home.

I'm gonna say
that's bull[bleep].

01:35.428 --> 01:36.679
You made a tattoo uglier
than what it needed to be

01:36.763 --> 01:39.057
by doing that background.

This does not look
like a lion body.

It does not look good.

{\an8}so that when the lights go out,
the human form

{\an8}to come up with the concept
that they can make an illusion.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.121

just concentrate on the octopus

06:53.204 --> 06:54.705
and black out everything else.

All right, guys,
hit the lights.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.876
- Ooh.
- That's super bright.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.295
{\an4}(Tyler)
We were going for psychedelic
'cause it glows in the dark.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.296
{\an5}(Oliver)
The key here
would have been

09:07.380 --> 09:08.798
to leave out parts
of the body.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.675
There's glow in the dark
all over the entire human form,

09:10.758 --> 09:13.803
so what we see is
a silhouette of the human form.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.265
As far as the real ingenuity
part of this challenge,

09:17.348 --> 09:19.558
you might have fallen
a little bit short.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.520
Dave and Erik.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.982
Hit the lights.

09:26.065 --> 09:26.732
(all)
Ooh.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.401
(Dave C)
We figured we'd take

09:28.484 --> 09:30.403
a little risk
and try to shape the body first.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.738
You really do lose the sense
of what the shape

09:32.822 --> 09:34.031
of the body is.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.492
{\an4}(Chris)
I like the way
that you ended at the bottom

09:36.575 --> 09:38.411
{\an1}to where it stops thigh high,
then it disappears.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.246
{\an1}You actually
saved yourself a lot of work.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.372
That also shows ingenuity

09:41.455 --> 09:44.166
{\an1}because you're
working smart, not hard.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.002
I think you did a great job.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.670
Duffy and Chris.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.591
{\an3}This is a really,
really creative approach,

09:52.675 --> 09:55.511
{\an3}and you've shown
a lot of ingenuity here.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.555
{\an1}We want to talk
about cool things

09:57.638 --> 09:59.223
that are artistically inspiring

09:59.307 --> 10:01.851
{\an1}and move your competitors
to try to rise to your level.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.020
You did an amazing job.

10:04.103 --> 10:04.729
St. Marq and Marisa.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.483
Great use of the body

10:09.567 --> 10:11.235
with the movement
to show ingenuity.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.403
It's a strong image.

10:12.486 --> 10:15.156
{\an1}Really using the negative
and having the falling petals

10:15.239 --> 10:17.491
work to your advantage.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.492
It gives a nice warm effect

10:18.576 --> 10:21.537
{\an1}because of the colors
that you chose.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.539
{\an3}Very cool, guys.
Thank you.

10:23.622 --> 10:25.916
Matt and Katie.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.503
(Marisa)
Ooh, oh, that's cool.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.921
{\an5}(Oliver)
The strength of this
is the concept.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.506
I love the depth of field
that you have.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.759
You used so much negative space

10:34.842 --> 10:36.802
{\an1}to really bring out
the positive.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.970
When the lights went off,

10:38.054 --> 10:39.930
{\an1}the balloon on the back
of her head

10:40.014 --> 10:42.183
{\an1}completely eliminated
the human form.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.561
{\an1}It took me to a scenery,
and that really shows ingenuity.

10:45.644 --> 10:46.771
Kruseman and Earl.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.067
(Oliver)
I don't really see

10:51.150 --> 10:52.568
the human body
once the light goes out,

10:52.651 --> 10:55.988
but I also don't see any kind
of real artistic creativity.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.240
Obviously, this is gonna tie
into a tattoo challenge.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.700
We're going
to be judging ingenuity,

10:59.784 --> 11:01.952
and if you're not hungry
to win this challenge,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.496
I don't know
how it's going to help you out

11:03.579 --> 11:05.206
in this competition.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.793
Craig and Big Ceeze.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.129
Let's hit the lights.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.215
Get out of town!

11:14.298 --> 11:15.966
{\an5}(Oliver)
[bleep] performance
theater here.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.093
You created a root base

11:17.176 --> 11:18.886
{\an1}with his legs--
the trunk, the limb,

11:18.969 --> 11:20.805
{\an1}a real moving,
functioning snake.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.431
It's very commendable, man.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.892
{\an8}I don't think they expected this
coming from us.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.396
{\an8}I think it just nailed us
this win.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.815
All right, guys.
Today we're testing ingenuity.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.858
Give me the top three
of the day.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.235
Matt and Katie--

11:34.318 --> 11:35.486
{\an1}the depth of field
with all that negative space

11:35.569 --> 11:38.364
{\an1}and those simple,
bright hot-air balloons.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.323
I loved that.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.117
Chris and Duffy I thought
did a great job

11:41.200 --> 11:42.576
with the octopus.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.036
{\an6}(Oliver)
And just adding a little bit
of movement,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.287
{\an3}I feel like the octopus
really came to life.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.124
Craig and Big Ceeze, who did
the tree trunk with the snake,

11:48.207 --> 11:49.417
were very creative.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.709
It took a lot of thought,

11:50.793 --> 11:52.503
{\an3}a lot of ingenuity,
and he starts moving around,

11:52.586 --> 11:55.297
{\an3}and it was
borderline ingenious.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.424
I think we have a decision.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.510
- Yeah.
- Let's let 'em know.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.804
Today you had
to use ingenuity

12:01.887 --> 12:06.392
to create
the ultimate optical illusion.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.394
The judges have decided
the winners

12:08.477 --> 12:10.646
of today's flash challenge
are...

12:14.066 --> 12:16.026
Craig and Big Ceeze.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.241
{\an3}The technical application
was so smooth.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.492
The details were so nice.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.577
{\an3}The contrast and the depth
you were able to achieve

12:24.660 --> 12:27.413
- was over the top.
- Thank you.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.706
{\an8}Craig and I freakin' knocked
this one out of the park.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.084
Can't wait
to pass out those skulls.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.669
Big Ceeze and Craig,

12:33.752 --> 12:36.672
together, you'll have the power
to assign all human canvases

12:36.755 --> 12:37.506
for the elimination tattoo.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.924
(Craig)
I'm not playing around.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.470
I got a [bleep] list
of everybody's name on it.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.347
{\an8}This group needs to be broken in
on how we play this game.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.348
Head back to the loft

12:46.432 --> 12:49.518
and prepare
for the next elimination tattoo.

12:52.771 --> 12:53.981
{\an3}I'm here
to change the whole game.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.941
- I want to hear them get hit.
- I can't wait.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.234
Let's just send a message.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.070
What the [bleep] is going on?
This girl is passed out.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.615
Can I get medical, please?

13:02.698 --> 13:03.949
{\an1}(man)
Hello?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.040
{\an3}I'm not really looking out
for anyone,

13:11.123 --> 13:12.166
{\an3}so I'm here
to change the whole game.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.959
{\an3}There's a lot of people
thinking they're gonna skate

13:14.043 --> 13:16.003
- through this whole thing.
- Absolutely.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.713
I want to hear them get hit,

13:17.796 --> 13:19.882
try to defend themselves,
and get hit even harder.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.300
I'm trying to win.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.176
I'm going in with a mission.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.386
{\an3}I'm taking names,
taking numbers,

13:24.470 --> 13:26.889
and I'm gonna show people
how this game is played.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.349
The strategy is to look

13:28.432 --> 13:30.017
{\an3}at people's strengths
and weaknesses

13:30.100 --> 13:31.060
to take out someone.

13:31.143 --> 13:31.852
{\an1}That's exactly
what I want to do.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.896
{\an1}And we got Chris
for color realism.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.565
- Put him with St. Marq.
- That cocky fool.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.025
{\an1}I want to see that guy freakin'
be knocked down a level.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.861
{\an3}Just send a message
as soon as we walk down there.

13:40.945 --> 13:41.862
I can't wait.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.961
Welcome
to the elimination tattoo.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.046
You came in
as master and apprentices,

13:59.129 --> 14:01.423
but remember,
only one of you will walk away

14:01.507 --> 14:04.635
with $100,000,
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

14:04.718 --> 14:07.680
and the title of Ink Master.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.723
This week
we're testing ingenuity.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.227
{\an8}Ingenuity in a tattoo
is using a design

14:13.310 --> 14:14.520
{\an8}in a creative way
to work well on the body

14:14.603 --> 14:17.189
{\an8}and be visually appealing.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.941
Today you must find
a unique way

14:19.024 --> 14:22.278
to use your canvas's anatomy
to make your tattoo

14:22.361 --> 14:23.112
come to life.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.281
- What?
- What does that mean?

14:25.364 --> 14:28.659
From armpits to belly buttons
to a fist or a foot,

14:28.742 --> 14:30.452
you must work
with the shape and movement

14:30.536 --> 14:32.371
of that body part
to create an illusion.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.707
Seriously?

14:34.790 --> 14:38.127
{\an8}Ingenuity is really important
to create this illusion

14:38.210 --> 14:41.797
{\an8}because you need that body part
to be a part of your tattoo.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.967
It takes tattooing
to a whole nother level.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.387
In this elimination tattoo,
you will be tattooing

14:48.470 --> 14:51.181
head-to-head
against one other artist.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.977
One artist will win
and one will lose.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.271
Lose, and this could be
your last day

14:57.354 --> 14:58.772
in this competition.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.107
- [exhales sharply]
- Let's meet your canvases.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.782
Craig and Big Ceeze,
you won the flash challenge.

15:08.866 --> 15:12.202
You now have the power
to assign all human canvases.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.163
Together,
by assigning the skulls,

15:14.246 --> 15:17.458
you're also determining
who tattoos head-to-head,

15:17.541 --> 15:19.293
so choose carefully.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.795
Today's the perfect day
to have skull pick.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.005
What do you want to get?

15:23.088 --> 15:23.756
{\an3}Grim Reaper with his hand
extended on my forearm.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.132
My hand is gonna be his hand.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.094
{\an8}We got to turn their bodies
into an interactive tattoo?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.262
{\an3}I want to get a laughing Buddha
on my belly.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.057
Using my belly button
as the Buddha's belly button.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.059
(Craig)
Nobody is getting anything

15:35.142 --> 15:37.269
that they want to do here
but me.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.063
Everybody else
is gonna struggle today.

15:39.146 --> 15:42.024
{\an3}Can I get a rainforest
incorporating my butt crack?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.567
A rainforest
coming out of your butt crack?

15:43.651 --> 15:47.529
{\an8}- [bleep]
- All right.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.865
{\an3}Incorporating my butt crack
as her cleavage.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.033
- What?
- Okay.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.910
{\an3}A pinup girl
on the back of my neck...

15:52.993 --> 15:55.204
- and have my hair as her hair.
- That's ridiculous.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.123
{\an3}I want to get a mermaid
on the left side of my head.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.625
- A dragon mouth.
- In your armpit?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.503
- Yeah.
- Oof, armpit.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.130
- A wolf mouth in my armpit.
- There's some [bleep].

16:05.214 --> 16:07.216
{\an8}The armpit
is a very sensitive area,

16:07.299 --> 16:11.136
{\an8}and people don't sit very well,
so whoever gets armpits,

16:11.220 --> 16:11.887
{\an8}they're gonna have a tough time.

16:11.970 --> 16:15.724
They have no idea what's coming.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.435
{\an1}Yeah.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
{\an8}Ultimately,
our goal is put everyone

16:20.771 --> 16:23.023
{\an8}out of their comfort zone.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.652
We are sneaky.
This is chess, not checkers.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.913
{\an3}(Dave)
Canvases, one by one,

16:37.996 --> 16:40.416
please read the artist's name
on the bottom of your skull.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.292
(man)
Kito.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.169
Dave.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.171
Head-to-head.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.923
Matt.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.466
Big Ceeze.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.557
Marisa.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.936
{\an8}Which one was that?

17:01.019 --> 17:03.605
Please, God,
don't let it be me.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.483
- Earl.
- [sighs]

17:06.567 --> 17:07.943
[bleep].

17:08.026 --> 17:10.028
Craig.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.655
Katie.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.823
[imitates gunshot]

17:12.906 --> 17:14.157
I see you, Craig.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.160
- Rain forest?
- In his butt crack.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.290
{\an3}Everybody's sweating
over here.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.040
St. Marq.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.877
- [giggles]
- I got this.

17:24.960 --> 17:25.961
I wished for it.

17:26.044 --> 17:29.506
Medusa,
butt crack cleavage.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.924
Chris.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.552
{\an1}St. Marq versus Chris.
One of them got to lose.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.928
{\an1}Smart.

17:35.012 --> 17:35.471
Thank you, Craig.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.306
Erik.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.058
Tyler.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.185
[bleep], yeah.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.644
- Kruseman.
- Oh.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.272
{\an8}She wants a pinup
on the back of her neck,

17:45.355 --> 17:47.983
{\an8}and she wants her hair
to be the pinup's hair.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.487
{\an8}How ridiculous
is that gonna look?

17:51.570 --> 17:52.654
{\an8}Duffy.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.491
{\an8}I'm going up against my master
in this competition.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.285
{\an8}I definitely got the [bleep] end
of the skull pick.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.914
This is
gonna be crazy.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.290
(Dave)
Remember, artists,

18:03.373 --> 18:05.876
after the elimination tattoo,
the human canvas jury

18:05.959 --> 18:08.170
will vote on the tattoo
that they think is the worst

18:08.253 --> 18:11.048
and put one artist
up for elimination.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.050
You'll have six hours
to use ingenuity

18:13.133 --> 18:16.970
to fully transform
your canvases body part.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.682
Based on your work,
one of you will close shop.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.769
- [sighs]
- Good luck.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.688
{\an8}How's it going, buddy?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.106
{\an8}In this elimination tattoo,
all the artists have

18:28.190 --> 18:31.819
{\an8}to creatively use
their canvases body part

18:31.902 --> 18:35.155
{\an8}to make a design that does
more than just sit on the skin.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.407
{\an1}When I first started hearing
everybody's ideas...

18:37.491 --> 18:38.867
- You were frightened.
- Oh, I was petrified.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.202
{\an3}[laughs]

18:40.285 --> 18:42.704
We want to have our minds blown
with some creative ingenuity.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.248
Perfect.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.707
(Oliver)
We want to see these artists

18:45.791 --> 18:46.875
show us that they're not
just tracers.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.796
{\an3}Armpits are not the easiest
place to get tattooed--

18:50.879 --> 18:54.716
{\an3}It's pretty sensitive, so this
is going to be a little intense.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.009
{\an1}Are you open
to artist interpretation.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.095
{\an3}I'd like to stick
to the wolf, really.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.223
I got dished
the [bleep] canvas possible.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.851
{\an8}It's a wolf in the armpit,
and this is not going

19:03.934 --> 19:05.144
{\an8}to translate well.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.728
- It's gonna hurt.
- I know.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.105
{\an3}This is going to be
my second tattoo.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.648
{\an1}You are definitely going
to earn this tattoo.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.066
I'm hating life.

19:11.149 --> 19:13.735
I really don't want
to do this tattoo.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.070
It sucks.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.738
You were saying
what you wanted,

19:16.822 --> 19:17.573
{\an1}and a lot of guys
were shaking their heads,

19:17.656 --> 19:19.283
{\an1}and I had
some really clear ideas.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.534
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.743
{\an3}(woman)
You could do it somehow, like,

19:21.827 --> 19:22.953
{\an3}that it looks kind of like me,
but as Medusa.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.290
- You want to try that?
- Yes!

19:26.373 --> 19:28.250
{\an8}St. Marq definitely is
at a disadvantage on this one.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.710
{\an3}Ah!

19:29.793 --> 19:31.420
{\an3}I love you.
I'm gonna say that straight up.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.046
Luckily, Craig just fell
right into my strategy.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.257
You put me up
against St. Marq.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.134
He does black and gray.
You have me a full color piece.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.554
And you just knocked St. Marq
out by doing that.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.807
{\an1}[bleep].

19:43.891 --> 19:45.934
What the [bleep] is going on?
This girl is passed out.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.437
Can I get medical, please?

19:55.402 --> 19:56.194
Hello?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.199
(Chris B)
I'm screwed right now.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.207
My canvas is passed out
in my chair.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.084
{\an1}Hello?

20:11.168 --> 20:13.211
[bleep].

20:13.295 --> 20:15.380
{\an1}Hello? Hi.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.632
{\an3}Hi.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.050
{\an1}You know you were
just passed out, right?

20:18.133 --> 20:19.301
I was sleeping.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.219
{\an1}I think you were doing
a little bit more than sleeping.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.972
{\an1}Probably not the best idea
for you to get tattooed today.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.975
{\an1}It's my judgment call.
I can't have you stay here.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.728
What the heck am I supposed
to do--tattoo my own butt crack?

20:29.811 --> 20:32.981
Are you serious?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.817
- Hey, Chris, let's have a chat.
- Yeah.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.235
{\an1}Obviously,
this isn't your fault.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.987
In order to move on
in this competition,

20:39.071 --> 20:41.406
{\an1}you're gonna have to tattoo
the same exact body part.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.909
{\an1}We have arrangements
to get another canvas in here.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.202
{\an1}Once your canvas arrives,
you'll have three hours

20:45.285 --> 20:48.538
{\an1}of design time
and six hours to tattoo.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.208
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- All right, buddy, good luck.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.335
{\an8}In this competition,
you must tattoo.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.170
{\an8}So now Chris is gonna have
to rethink his entire concept

20:55.253 --> 20:57.422
{\an8}for somebody else
that's coming in,

20:57.506 --> 21:01.343
{\an8}and this could definitely
throw someone off their game.

21:01.426 --> 21:07.182
Artists, you have six hours
to create an illusion.

21:07.265 --> 21:10.644
And your time begins now.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.062
All right, let's do it.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.189
{\an1}I'm gonna go ahead
and put the stencil on you.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.858
{\an5}(Chris)
In order to achieve an optical
illusion tattoo properly,

21:16.942 --> 21:17.859
you're going to really have
to know the anatomy

21:17.943 --> 21:20.028
and dynamics of the image

21:20.112 --> 21:21.613
that you're tattooing
and the body part

21:21.697 --> 21:22.698
that you're placing it on.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.535
{\an3}Dude, that's perfect
on the first try.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.578
If you're not a genius
doing these tattoos,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.080
you will not succeed.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.457
{\an3}Oh. Ah.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.209
{\an1}I really do not like
the shell.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.878
{\an3}There's not much elements
besides the scales on her face

21:36.962 --> 21:38.797
{\an3}that are going to make her look
like a mermaid.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.049
I just know my pain tolerance,
and I just want you to be able

21:41.133 --> 21:42.175
to have a finished piece.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.302
{\an3}Whether I do a hand
or a hand with a shell in it,

21:44.386 --> 21:46.888
{\an3}it's gonna be
about the same amount of time.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.724
{\an8}I have to show ingenuity
with this tattoo.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.185
{\an8}If I start taking details out,
it might make no sense.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.022
{\an8}I'm going head-to-head
with my mentor, Kruseman.

21:55.105 --> 21:59.192
{\an8}I really, really just need
to win an elimination challenge.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.152
{\an8}- Hi, guys.
- Hey, buddy.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.571
{\an8}- How you doing?
- My final tattoo...

22:02.654 --> 22:04.239
{\an8}before I go home-skie.

22:04.322 --> 22:06.033
{\an8}I feel like I can't win
for nothing, man.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.784
{\an8}I'm just getting screwed
left and right.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.995
{\an8}I have too much integrity
to give this lady

22:10.078 --> 22:11.913
{\an8}a headless pinup
on the back of her head.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.040
{\an8}I'm not gonna do it.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.082
{\an3}Sometimes
you can't be bought.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.375
This is the type of challenge

22:15.459 --> 22:17.836
that's making me want
to throw in the towel.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.550
- Hi.
- Hi. Brandi.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.593
{\an1}I'm Chris.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.844
{\an1}So, originally,
I had drawn up a Medusa, right?

22:25.927 --> 22:27.012
- For the other girl.
- Right.

22:27.095 --> 22:27.929
{\an1}Kind of tweaked it up
to make it work.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.223
{\an1}How do you feel
about that same concept?

22:30.307 --> 22:31.308
Not my style.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.436
{\an3}I'm thinking water goddess,
like, mermaid...

22:34.519 --> 22:35.687
{\an1}Okay, got ya.
All right.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.522
{\an5}(Chris B)
I just drew for three hours
for the Medusa.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.317
I'm meeting my new canvas,
and she wants a water goddess

22:40.400 --> 22:41.318
or a mermaid.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.153
{\an8}Another three hours
of drawing.

22:48.033 --> 22:52.788
My head's all screwed up.
I'm burnt. I'm spent.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.248
{\an1}[moaning]

22:55.332 --> 22:56.500
I'm here for one thing.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.710
{\an3}So this time
I'm not screwing around.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.003
[whimpers]

23:00.087 --> 23:03.673
{\an8}Craig is here to play the game
against other strong artists,

23:03.757 --> 23:05.801
{\an8}and he chose to go head-to-head
with me.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.552
{\an3}I definitely feel the heat
'cause you're a rad tattooer.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.639
{\an1}I wasn't going for anybody easy.
You've been doing it.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.057
{\an3}Thank you.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.017
Huge mistake going up
against me.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.686
I'm tattooing a bold, bright,
traditional tattoo

23:16.770 --> 23:18.647
on this guy's knee ditch
to knock Craig out.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.190
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.526
Three hours remaining.
Three more hours.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.321
Oh, my God.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.489
{\an3}So that would be, like,
the general idea.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.324
- I'm gonna start some seashell.
- Okay, awesome.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.868
Finally got
the water goddess drawn.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.495
We're ready to tattoo.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.497
{\an1}Mentally prepared
for six hours, okay?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.332
- The goal is to finish it.
- That's it.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.584
{\an8}Chris doesn't
get discouraged easily.

23:39.668 --> 23:43.505
{\an8}If anything, he's gonna try
harder to beat St. Marq out,

23:43.588 --> 23:46.508
{\an8}and hopefully
he just kicks his ass.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.176
{\an3}(St. Marq)
We're doing some ass grass.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.637
{\an3}We're gonna
leave the grass ass colored.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.514
{\an8}I am an artist with vision.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.683
It's gonna be hard
to stack up against my tattoo.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.852
Chris is gonna have
to work double time

23:56.935 --> 23:58.854
to try to even get close.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.522
Final hour of tattooing.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.026
[whimpers]

24:05.110 --> 24:07.445
{\an3}Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

24:07.529 --> 24:07.988
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, please.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.532
Hold on, hold on.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.284
{\an8}My canvas is being a sissy.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.869
{\an8}He's making me stop
every two seconds.

24:13.952 --> 24:17.914
{\an3}Ow!

24:17.998 --> 24:19.207
{\an3}Hold on.
Hold on again.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.042
I'm going
into freak-out mode.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.253
I suffer
from bipolar disorder,

24:23.336 --> 24:25.964
and sometimes my emotions
get in the way.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.258
I'm [bleep] beyond furious
at this point.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.719
{\an1}I just want
to finish the tattoo.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.053
{\an9}I know.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.513
{\an9}[whimpers]

24:33.597 --> 24:34.890
If he doesn't make it
through this...

24:34.973 --> 24:36.224
{\an3}Ah-ha-ha.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.978
He's basically
sending me home.

24:40.061 --> 24:40.854
{\an1}[moans]

24:40.937 --> 24:42.731
{\an3}Towards the end
is the worst part.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.482
{\an3}You made it this far.
You're doing really good.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.068
{\an8}All I can do is try to coach her
down a little bit

24:47.152 --> 24:50.071
{\an8}to keep her
from tapping out on me.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.072
- Yeah.
- Just got to power through.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.407
Bear with me.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.451
{\an5}(Marisa)
I really need to win
against Earl.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.871
That will prove
that I deserve to be here.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.332
[canvases moaning]

25:02.375 --> 25:03.168
{\an1}Ay.
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

25:03.251 --> 25:08.131
Five, four, three...

25:08.215 --> 25:10.050
two, one.

25:10.133 --> 25:12.302
That's it. Machines down.
Time is up.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.512
No more ink.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.306
{\an3}Looks amazing.
I love it.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.099
- I love it.
- Sweet.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.310
Kruseman might just go
to the bottom with this tattoo.

25:20.393 --> 25:23.730
He did not try to use her hair
for the illusion at all.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.775
I expected way more
out of him.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.151
(woman)
Have fun.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.986
You think I'm rattled
because of this?

25:30.070 --> 25:31.238
I'm a Marine.
I'm gonna adapt.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.447
I'm gonna overcome this one.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.406
I'm gonna give her
a fantastic tattoo.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.700
St. Marq,
you have nothing on me,

25:35.784 --> 25:36.701
and I'm gonna beat you
in this challenge.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.956
- Got to hang with me, okay?
- I'm trying.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.332
He don't even want
to [bleep] be here.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.209
{\an3}Where the [bleep] do you get
I want to be out of here?

25:44.292 --> 25:46.336
{\an3}So you can't [bleep]
say one thing!

25:46.419 --> 25:47.921
This thing is ugly, bro.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.214
Are you kidding me?

25:49.297 --> 25:50.799
It's hard to tell
what the [bleep] going on.

25:50.882 --> 25:54.344
{\an1}Make it easier on everybody
and throw in the towel.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.809
Hands down, I don't think
I met the challenge.

26:00.892 --> 26:05.105
{\an4}(Marisa)
They said today, like,
follow the challenge.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.315
It's either look like an idiot
or do a cool tattoo.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.151
{\an1}Your canvas signed up
for this [bleep].

26:10.235 --> 26:11.736
I had a choice to make.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.989
I could either do a pinup girl
with half of her head cut off,

26:14.072 --> 26:15.365
or I could do
a [bleep] sick tattoo

26:15.448 --> 26:16.783
on the back of her neck
and take a chance on going home.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.410
{\an6}(St. Marq)
Well, that could be
really dangerous.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.953
They'd be fools
for sending me home,

26:20.036 --> 26:23.707
because I'm a [bleep] solid
tattooer in this competition.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.765
Today you had to use ingenuity
to come up with a clever way

26:40.849 --> 26:43.560
to transform
your canvas's body part.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.270
Each of you
tattooed head-to-head

26:45.353 --> 26:46.313
with another artist.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.774
One of you will win,
and one of you will lose.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.070
Craig.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.113
You went head-to-head
with Katie.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.824
{\an1}In the bends of the knee,
the skin is very soft.

26:57.907 --> 26:58.950
It's very delicate.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.702
{\an1}I think you did a great job
applying this tattoo.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.288
{\an1}The way it's placed on here
when her leg's straight--

27:03.371 --> 27:04.080
{\an1}It looks great
when her leg's bent.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.166
It looks great.

27:06.249 --> 27:10.253
{\an1}It's just a really smooth,
slick tattoo.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.589
Katie.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.883
{\an3}Overall, I think
you did hit the challenge.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.761
The only design element
that I don't really love

27:17.844 --> 27:19.054
is the shape of the tongue.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.055
It looks like these
could be cherries,

27:20.138 --> 27:22.349
{\an3}but the shading, the color,
it's all strong.

27:22.432 --> 27:26.186
It's a fun, cool tattoo.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.229
{\an8}All right, guys,
between Craig and Katie,

27:28.313 --> 27:29.439
{\an8}who took this one?

27:29.522 --> 27:30.732
{\an7}Man, Craig's
is so slick and smooth.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.735
{\an8}- I'm going with Craig.
- I'm going with Craig.

27:33.818 --> 27:34.903
Craig got this one.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.529
The judges have decided
the winner

27:36.613 --> 27:40.075
of this head-to-head battle
is Craig.

27:41.534 --> 27:42.327
St. Marq.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.038
You went head-to-head
with Chris.

27:45.121 --> 27:47.082
So he initially
wanted a rain forest,

27:47.165 --> 27:48.958
and I'm just really glad
that you went this way,

27:49.042 --> 27:51.836
as opposed to the jungle
with trees.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.255
I felt fortunate,
since we're judging ingenuity,

27:54.339 --> 27:55.423
that I got
to think on my feet.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.509
{\an1}Very smooth.
Has a nice look to it.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.593
{\an1}Definitely gives
an inference of depth,

27:58.676 --> 28:00.762
{\an1}but this is
right along the lines

28:00.845 --> 28:04.432
{\an1}of almost every other tattoo
we've seen you do.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.267
{\an1}We get it--
you're great at this smooth,

28:06.351 --> 28:07.352
{\an1}black-and-gray,
no-outline thing.

28:07.435 --> 28:12.357
{\an1}That one trick isn't going
to take you to the end.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.442
Chris.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.902
I really like this tattoo.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.488
{\an8}I think that it's really dynamic
and beautiful.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.323
{\an8}Your palette is excellent.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.283
{\an8}It absolutely hits
the challenge,

28:22.367 --> 28:25.620
{\an8}in terms of making this girl's
ass crack into the cleavage

28:25.703 --> 28:27.122
{\an8}of this sea goddess.

28:27.205 --> 28:29.499
{\an9}It is a solid, strong,
badass tattoo.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.251
{\an9}I mean, I'm a sucker
for a pretty lady,

28:31.334 --> 28:32.502
{\an8}and I love all the detail.

28:32.585 --> 28:35.130
{\an8}I think I'll lean to Chris.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.464
I'm leaning
with Chris as well.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.549
I'm going with Chris.

28:37.632 --> 28:41.636
The winner of this head-to-head
battle is Chris.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.304
Dave.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.598
You went head-to-head
with Kito.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.809
Out of the people that had
to attach a foot or a hand

28:47.892 --> 28:49.310
onto a foreshortened image,

28:49.394 --> 28:51.312
{\an1}you're the one
that took the right approach.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.647
{\an1}This angle of the arm
has a smooth transition out

28:52.730 --> 28:55.650
{\an1}from way back
leaning forward to the fist.

28:55.733 --> 28:56.734
{\an3}It's a nice, smooth,
soft ending,

28:56.818 --> 29:00.321
{\an3}and I think you really pulled
the tattoo off.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.160
Kito.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.786
{\an3}This is so nice
and open and airy.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.455
{\an3}It breathes.
It's readable.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.457
{\an3}But you lost it
in the art.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.208
{\an1}The idea is that
the hand that's attached to here

29:12.292 --> 29:14.461
is coming at you.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.838
{\an1}Just a straight-on,
frontal view of the Reaper

29:16.921 --> 29:18.339
{\an1}doesn't work
in this challenge.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.841
Without foreshortening,

29:19.924 --> 29:23.511
{\an1}it makes no sense
that this hand is that big.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.472
It's crazy.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.640
{\an9}Dave definitely
showed ingenuity,

29:27.724 --> 29:30.727
{\an8}and the perspective on this
really, really works well.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.061
{\an1}Dave.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.773
Winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Dave.

29:35.857 --> 29:36.816
Erik.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.610
You went head-to-head
with Tyler.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.987
I'm not seeing
the perspective here,

29:41.070 --> 29:44.240
other than it looks like
she might have an enormous foot.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.533
Tried to do
something really dynamic

29:45.617 --> 29:46.910
with a lot of foreshortening.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.078
{\an1}Really no foreshortening
throughout.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.039
{\an1}From that knee down,
it just goes...

29:51.122 --> 29:52.248
{\an1}Wah!
To the foot.

29:52.332 --> 29:56.044
Didn't work out.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.421
Tyler.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.714
I can say a lot of nice things
about how clean your tattoo is,

29:59.797 --> 30:02.717
{\an1}but you have absolutely
zero perspective

30:02.800 --> 30:03.510
{\an1}or foreshortening
in this design.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.720
{\an1}There's no distance,
no depth.

30:05.803 --> 30:08.890
{\an1}It's just down to the leg,
and then at the ankle,

30:08.973 --> 30:10.266
you just go...

30:10.350 --> 30:11.351
{\an1}Whoop!
Foot.

30:11.434 --> 30:15.605
{\an1}Does it create the illusion?
Not in the slightest.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.483
{\an7}I will say
that Tyler's is super clean.

30:18.566 --> 30:20.693
{\an7}The color's great.
The details are great.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.028
{\an8}- I would go with Tyler.
- Tyler.

30:22.111 --> 30:26.991
The winner of this
head-to-head battle is Tyler.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.493
Big Ceeze.

30:28.576 --> 30:30.203
You went head-to-head
with Matt.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.829
You have done
a really great job

30:31.913 --> 30:34.541
of making this belly button
the Buddha's belly button.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.750
{\an3}The shading in this--
so much better

30:35.833 --> 30:38.086
{\an3}than anything I've seen
from you, and I'm happy for you.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.256
{\an3}I'm glad
to see you come back.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.716
Matt.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.717
I have more problems

30:44.801 --> 30:45.969
{\an1}with the drawing
than anything else.

30:46.052 --> 30:48.596
{\an1}The toes and the one hand
holding the bowl

30:48.680 --> 30:50.640
look really remedial.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.600
I did purposely
kind of dumb my drawing down,

30:52.684 --> 30:53.851
just knowing that I was dealing
with darker skin.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.229
{\an3}But the drawing itself
has nothing to do

30:56.312 --> 30:57.564
with the color skin you get.

30:57.647 --> 31:01.234
{\an3}Don't let the color of skin
throw off your art.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.902
{\an8}Let's talk about a win here.

31:02.986 --> 31:03.778
{\an9}Big Ceeze definitely
did something

31:03.861 --> 31:05.363
{\an9}that was aesthetically
more pleasing.

31:05.446 --> 31:07.782
{\an8}I'm picking Ceeze.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.784
Yeah, I have to agree.
I'm going with Big Ceeze.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.119
{\an1}Ceeze.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.872
The winner of this head-to-head
battle is Big Ceeze.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.125
Marisa.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.794
You went head-to-head
with Earl.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.963
{\an1}For this idea,
fitting in the armpit,

31:22.046 --> 31:23.381
I do commend you
on getting a lot

31:23.464 --> 31:25.049
{\an1}of these lines in there
really clean

31:25.133 --> 31:27.135
{\an1}in this very tender part
of the body.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.720
You've taken some pretty
heavy beatings up here...

31:28.803 --> 31:29.637
Yeah.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.638
{\an3}And this is not one
of those days.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.141
{\an3}Oddly enough,
this is probably

31:33.224 --> 31:36.227
my favorite tattoo
I've seen you do.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.689
Earl.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.649
This thing is ugly, bro.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.651
This was
a living nightmare.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.944
By ten minutes in,
he was crying.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.615
{\an1}This tattoo is riddled
with weird choices.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.658
On the side of the nose,
there's those two divots

31:50.742 --> 31:51.492
that almost look
like that may be

31:51.576 --> 31:52.744
where his eyes would be.

31:52.827 --> 31:56.205
{\an8}That's literally
off the picture.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.041
{\an1}Just because your reference
was a real photo

31:58.124 --> 32:01.294
{\an1}doesn't mean
that the tattoo is real looking.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.504
{\an1}You made this look
like his eyes

32:03.588 --> 32:04.672
are on his upper lip.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.883
It's crazy.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.762
{\an8}(Dave)
Between Marisa and Earl...

32:10.845 --> 32:12.013
{\an8}It's obviously Marisa.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.348
{\an8}I got to go
with Marisa, too.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.390
{\an3}Marisa.

32:14.474 --> 32:18.436
Winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Marisa.

32:18.519 --> 32:19.687
Duffy.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.064
You went head-to-head
with Kruseman.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.692
As far as placement goes,
you certainly used her hairline

32:24.776 --> 32:27.904
to create hair,
and you hit the challenge there.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.030
I don't like this one.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.406
{\an3}Her eyes are incredibly
far apart.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.075
{\an3}That line that you put
off of the lip

32:32.158 --> 32:34.285
really pushes her out
to have a duck bill.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.411
{\an3}This is definitely
my least favorite tattoo

32:35.495 --> 32:38.331
I've seen you do.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.378
Kruseman.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.879
What was
your plan of attack here?

32:44.962 --> 32:47.006
She wanted a pinup girl
on the back of her neck

32:47.090 --> 32:48.925
with her hair
becoming the pinup girl's hair,

32:49.008 --> 32:51.678
and I just think
that's a ridiculous idea.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.888
{\an8}I abandoned ship.

32:53.971 --> 32:55.181
{\an8}I wish
I would've got a Buddha

32:55.264 --> 32:56.808
{\an8}that I could just line up
the belly button or--

32:56.891 --> 32:59.519
{\an3}This is easy. To have the back
of a neck, no problem.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.562
- And I definitely tried.
- I don't think you did.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.356
{\an1}Abandon the challenge,
then I expect everything else

33:03.439 --> 33:04.649
of the tattoo
to be perfect,

33:04.732 --> 33:05.900
{\an1}and there's a lot of flaws
in the tattoo.

33:05.983 --> 33:06.901
{\an1}The black shading
from underneath her chin

33:06.984 --> 33:09.404
{\an1}where the earring is--
kind of weird.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.572
{\an1}The little outline of her lip
is a little bit wonky.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.574
Could it have been cleaner?
Absolutely.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.826
Tattooed it
on the back of her neck.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.160
If you're playing it, play it,

33:16.244 --> 33:19.497
{\an3}or make it easier on everybody
and throw in the towel.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.337
{\an8}Out of respect
for everybody standing here

33:26.421 --> 33:28.923
{\an8}who did the challenge,
you got to give it to Duffy.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.091
{\an8}I agree with that.

33:30.174 --> 33:33.594
Winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Duffy.

33:33.678 --> 33:37.098
The human canvas jury
is deliberating right now.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.100
Their vote will put one artist
up for elimination,

33:39.183 --> 33:41.728
and the canvas will be here
to tell us why.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.855
Head back to the loft,

33:43.938 --> 33:45.773
and we'll call you back
when we have a decision.

33:49.026 --> 33:51.237
Even though Kruseman
didn't meet the challenge,

33:51.320 --> 33:52.029
he pulled off a tattoo
that was better

33:52.113 --> 33:53.281
than both
of you guy's tattoos.

33:53.364 --> 33:56.701
I'm gonna slaughter anybody
if I get called down there.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.412
- Coming right back up.
- I get it--your the [bleep].

33:59.495 --> 34:00.747
He don't even want
to [bleep] be here.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.123
{\an3}I didn't say I didn't want
to be here.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.499
Your attitude is [bleep].

34:03.583 --> 34:05.460
{\an3}Where the [bleep] do you get
I want to be out of here?

34:05.543 --> 34:07.628
{\an3}So you can't [bleep]
say one thing!

34:07.712 --> 34:09.088
You're gonna push buttons.

34:09.172 --> 34:12.175
{\an3}'Cause you probably
shouldn't [bleep] do that.

34:17.804 --> 34:20.725
Today we're testing ingenuity

34:20.808 --> 34:22.851
with some pretty
interesting tattoos.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.228
I think
we saw some good ideas.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.147
We saw some examples
that weren't that great.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.357
{\an1}I definitely want
to bring Kruseman to the bottom,

34:28.440 --> 34:30.193
based on the quality
of his tattoo alone--

34:30.275 --> 34:31.610
{\an1}how off-centered the collar
of her shirt is compared

34:31.694 --> 34:34.030
to where her neck comes out.

34:34.112 --> 34:36.364
{\an1}He got rattled by the pressure,
and he cracked.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.159
{\an3}I'd love to see Earl down here.
It looks terrible.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.995
It's definitely
the least attractive of the day.

34:41.078 --> 34:42.871
{\an1}I mean, Erik's tattoo is
in the bottom for me.

34:42.955 --> 34:45.875
{\an1}I think he made
some very weird choices,

34:45.958 --> 34:48.628
{\an1}like that weird shading loosely
on that girl's foot.

34:48.710 --> 34:50.170
{\an1}If this girl
just puts a sock on,

34:50.254 --> 34:51.922
{\an1}she's got
a pretty nice tattoo.

34:52.005 --> 34:52.924
{\an3}Ugh.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.550
{\an8}It's really going
to be interesting

34:54.634 --> 34:55.842
{\an8}to see who
the human canvas jury voted for,

34:55.927 --> 34:59.388
{\an8}because their vote is going
to bring someone to the bottom.

34:59.472 --> 35:03.309
{\an8}We're here to determine who had
the worst tattoo of the day.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.229
{\an1}That is my tattoo,
and my artist was Katie.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.189
{\an5}(man)
That definitely does not look
like a tongue.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.691
{\an3}It looks like you got
really swollen tonsils.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.236
{\an5}(man)
The gold around the gums
looks like gingivitis.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.654
- What is that?
[laughter]

35:14.737 --> 35:17.782
It's a cartoonish tattoo.
You know, I totally dig it.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.575
{\an1}That's my tattoo.
My artist was Earl.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.077
But it has a deformed head.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.205
I don't know if those are eyes
or those are part of the fur.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.541
{\an1}Mine is definitely
not the worst of the day.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.377
That's my tattoo.
My artist was Kruseman.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.045
{\an5}(man)
It doesn't look at all
like here hair is going

35:31.128 --> 35:32.463
to go up to your hair.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.801
He was trying to incorporate it,
but also give me a nice tattoo.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.594
{\an1}This is a challenge,
and you're supposed to do

35:38.678 --> 35:39.387
what you got to do.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.014
I think he did
an awesome job.

35:44.141 --> 35:47.687
I'm definitely convinced
that I'm going down.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.780
The judges want to see...

35:57.864 --> 35:59.574
Earl...

35:59.657 --> 36:02.493
Erik...

36:02.577 --> 36:05.496
Kruseman...

36:05.580 --> 36:07.748
and Katie.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.043
See y'all downstairs.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.753
{\an1}I want to see
all y'all come back.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.213
(Big Ceeze)
Give 'em hell.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.306
Today you had to use ingenuity

36:23.389 --> 36:26.517
to create an illusion
on your canvas's skin.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.185
It's time to find out
who the human canvas jury

36:28.269 --> 36:32.148
determined had the worst tattoo
of the day.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.781
[scoffs]

36:40.865 --> 36:43.451
Katie, you're here
because the human canvas jury

36:43.534 --> 36:46.454
determined that you had
the worse tattoo of the day.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.914
I'm proud of the tattoo.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.625
I feel like it's really clean.
I stand by it, for sure.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.584
They didn't like the tongue,

36:51.667 --> 36:54.337
and they didn't like
the lack of detail.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.547
{\an3}I can kind of agree
on the tongue.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.840
It's just the style, man.

36:57.924 --> 37:00.676
Some people aren't into
traditional kind of imagery,

37:00.760 --> 37:01.886
so I think if the others
didn't like it,

37:01.969 --> 37:03.971
[bleep] what you heard.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.266
{\an5}(Dave)
All right, Danny.
Thank you.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.518
{\an1}Katie, obviously,
you've got to please the public.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.812
{\an1}So, anytime you do something
that's kind of hard

37:11.896 --> 37:13.147
{\an1}to understand,
you run that risk.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.815
{\an1}You could've had
a lot cooler tongue in there

37:14.899 --> 37:16.567
{\an1}and even made this thing
even better.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.361
Lesson learned.

37:18.444 --> 37:19.820
Kruseman.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.696
My concern for your future

37:20.780 --> 37:21.739
{\an1}is if this is
how you're going to do it,

37:21.822 --> 37:23.699
you're not gonna make it.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.992
I just failed.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.994
But did you fail,
or did you not do it?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.329
Or did you give up?

37:28.412 --> 37:29.830
That's what we're having
a hard time--

37:29.914 --> 37:31.290
I don't think
that I necessarily gave up.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.208
There's going to be some
other left-of-center challenges

37:32.291 --> 37:35.461
that you may think
aren't great ideas.

37:35.544 --> 37:38.381
I mean, Erik, were you dying
to do a ballerina

37:38.464 --> 37:39.590
that turns
into a huge foot today?

37:39.674 --> 37:41.467
No, and I don't think
I should be down here for this.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.845
{\an3}Erik, the stylistic choice
to put all that black

37:44.929 --> 37:47.932
{\an3}on that girl's foot
just is not flattering.

37:48.015 --> 37:49.183
It's stronger
than the other three, by far.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.936
{\an3}How can you say that
that tattoo looks better

37:52.019 --> 37:53.229
than the rest of the three?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.022
I mean it looks Britney Spears
after she shaved her head off.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.316
Man, if you want to go there,

37:57.400 --> 37:58.859
how many mistakes
have you made now?

37:58.943 --> 38:01.028
And you immediately
throw yourself under the bus.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.446
{\an3}In tattoos
or flash challenges?

38:02.530 --> 38:03.447
Both.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.532
{\an3}It's my first time
down here too.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.117
This was an awkward challenge
to me.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.745
At least I was hanging it
out there and going for it.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.205
Earl.

38:11.288 --> 38:12.331
This is, by far,

38:12.415 --> 38:14.375
{\an1}the most unattractive tattoo
of the day.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.793
{\an5}(Earl)
It's as detailed
as I could get it

38:15.876 --> 38:17.044
as it was in his armpit.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.337
- You say it's detailed...
- It's as detailed as I can get.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.715
{\an1}But it's hard to tell
what the [bleep] is going on.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.008
It's as detailed
as I can get.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.718
{\an1}So those details
are a failed attempt at details.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.052
{\an3}(Chris)
The face is disjointed.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.554
(Earl)
I get it.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.556
{\an3}You look at this, and it's like,
"Would you want this on you?"

38:28.639 --> 38:29.974
No, no, no, no, no.
I get it.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.143
In my situation, I did the best
I could with what I was given.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.394
I at least did the challenge.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.895
I'm here
to play a game and fight.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.023
Are you suggesting that Kruseman
didn't do the challenge?

38:37.106 --> 38:41.402
{\an3}He openly admitted
he didn't do the challenge.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.280
Well, this is a tricky one.
Let's debate this.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.323
In my opinion,
Katie's safe.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.117
In my opinion,
Erik's safe.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.452
{\an1}Agreed.

38:49.535 --> 38:52.788
My very first inclination
was to send Kruseman home.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.915
{\an1}I don't want to keep somebody
in the competition

38:54.999 --> 38:56.417
who's not gonna fight.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.544
{\an3}For me, this is splitting hairs,
and I'm looking at talent.

38:58.627 --> 39:00.588
Judging as the rules
of the game.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.630
Next week, it's like,

39:01.714 --> 39:02.840
"We're all going
to do head tattoos.

39:02.923 --> 39:04.633
Eh, I want to do it
on the chest."

39:04.717 --> 39:06.635
At this point,
I got to vote for Kruseman.

39:06.719 --> 39:11.223
And no disrespect, man,
'cause I [bleep] love your work.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.933
{\an3}I'll be damned if I'm sending
home a good tattooer,

39:13.017 --> 39:14.935
{\an3}and it's not that Earl's
not a good tattooer,

39:15.019 --> 39:18.939
{\an3}but he hasn't produced
the quality that Kruseman has.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.860
So what's your vote?

39:22.943 --> 39:25.446
Earl goes home.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.740
I'm gonna vote for Earl.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.241
The judges have decided.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.452
Earl, you do not
have what it takes

39:31.535 --> 39:32.870
to be Ink Master.

39:32.953 --> 39:33.704
It's my fault, man.
I couldn't--

39:33.788 --> 39:34.830
I couldn't get it
in the game, man.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.957
That's this room, man.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.667
{\an3}This room does it
to the best of 'em.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.337
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.134
Being in an element
that you're not used to,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.053
it really does
throw you off kilter.

39:49.136 --> 39:51.472
I wish I could have shown
more of what I do.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.848
This [bleep] sucks.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.434
I'm still out the game,
and I'm still out $100,000.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.816
{\an5}(announcer)
Still to come this season
on <i> Ink Master...</i>

40:01.899 --> 40:03.442
The cream rises to the top.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.319
We're meeting on the battlefield
in the middle of the fight.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.863
I see no one in my way.
Grab your popcorn.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.241
I am ready
to tear this [bleep] place up.

40:10.324 --> 40:11.951
- [whimpering]
- There you go, just breathe.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.452
{\an4}(Chris B)
Relax, relax.
You have to. You have to.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.663
You guys doing
an exorcism over there?

40:15.746 --> 40:18.290
{\an5}(Kruseman)
Did you forget
that this lady is a human being?

40:18.374 --> 40:19.625
{\an1}You tap out,
one of us goes home.

40:19.708 --> 40:22.503
She's [bleep] dying right now
in the chair.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.797
{\an3}Do you think
he really has your back?

40:24.880 --> 40:27.383
{\an1}He's had my back
the whole [bleep] time.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.926
It looks
like the fish is peeing.

40:29.009 --> 40:29.844
This bitch is crazy.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.595
I can't figure out
how to please her.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.388
{\an1}It makes me sick
to my [bleep] stomach.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.305
{\an3}Keep running
your [bleep] mouth.

40:33.389 --> 40:35.516
{\an3}Now that people know
we're together,

40:35.599 --> 40:37.726
{\an3}they're gonna try
to put us against each other.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.728
{\an1}I'm trying not
to lose my mind right now.

40:39.812 --> 40:40.688
Nobody is tattooing smart.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.190
It was the worst experience
I ever had.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.191
{\an1}There's no redeeming qualities
to this tattoo whatsoever.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.861
We're in a [bleep]
pissing contest.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.863
{\an3}You should get the [bleep]
out of here. Kick rocks.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.156
I think I did put
my balls out there.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.282
That's a big tattoo.

40:51.365 --> 40:52.908
{\an3}But it's big
with no purpose.
