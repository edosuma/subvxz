01:08.410 --> 01:10.379
A girlfriend
once wrote me a note:

01:11.714 --> 01:15.217
even the harshest places
in nature are perfect.

01:19.354 --> 01:22.825
There's something about living
by a large body of water.

01:22.859 --> 01:25.695
So vast and deep that not having

01:25.728 --> 01:28.665
grown up with the
ocean, it overwhelms me.

01:29.832 --> 01:31.333
It's too much to take in.

01:33.402 --> 01:36.538
I know that this same body
of water touches China.

01:37.807 --> 01:40.910
So many undiscovered
worlds beneath the surface.

01:42.277 --> 01:44.814
The tide is constantly changing.

01:46.548 --> 01:49.585
It's like when I'm painting
or making a sculpture.

01:50.953 --> 01:55.557
A rhythm takes over through
cycles that hopefully lead

01:56.926 --> 01:59.762
toward a burst of unexpected
inspiration or revelation

02:00.863 --> 02:02.665
I just dissolve into.

02:04.667 --> 02:08.604
But for the past
11 or so months,

02:08.638 --> 02:10.539
I haven't been able
to tap into that.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.910
For the past 11 or so months,

02:13.943 --> 02:18.581
there's been Charlie,
but we've drifted apart,

02:19.782 --> 02:22.284
a chasm between us, I said.

02:23.986 --> 02:25.655
She refuses to acknowledge it.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.861
Hannah?

02:35.564 --> 02:37.299
Hello?

02:37.332 --> 02:39.301
Hannah, I can see
your bike in here.

02:41.503 --> 02:42.638
Lulu.

02:43.639 --> 02:45.041
We met in Prague.

02:45.074 --> 02:46.709
I was backpacking through Europe

02:46.743 --> 02:49.879
and she was touring dance
academies with Julie,

02:49.912 --> 02:50.913
her business partner.

02:52.447 --> 02:57.252
I was thinking about moving
to LA and meeting her

02:57.987 --> 02:59.589
tipped my decision in its favor.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.131
Eventually
somebody is going

04:49.165 --> 04:50.398
to throw up in the car.

04:50.432 --> 04:51.801
I mean, it's
happened a few times.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.036
Not in this car but I've had
different car before this,

04:54.070 --> 04:55.938
but like, you'll
be talking to them,

04:55.972 --> 04:57.940
they'll be really drunk so
you'll ask them if they're okay

04:57.974 --> 05:00.643
- and they say they're fine-
- Can you turn this music up?

05:00.676 --> 05:01.509
Yeah. Sure.

05:01.543 --> 05:02.678
I like the song.

05:02.712 --> 05:03.913
Yeah,
it's cool. K-Pop.

05:05.147 --> 05:06.649
Princess Pop.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.718
Do you have a go-to
karaoke song or anything?

05:08.751 --> 05:10.418
Uh, I don't know.

05:11.654 --> 05:13.089
I don't really do karaoke.

05:13.122 --> 05:14.023
Really?
It's so much fun.

05:14.056 --> 05:16.959
There's this uh, there's
one in little Tokyo

05:16.993 --> 05:20.096
and it's in the mall and
you can bring your beer

05:20.129 --> 05:25.034
which is really nice, so,
you only end up spending...

05:29.805 --> 05:31.607
I'm so glad you're here.

05:36.946 --> 05:38.513
You know my mom's allergic.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.883
You could have
asked to bring her.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.019
Yeah, well I'm
here, so she's here.

06:09.278 --> 06:10.212
Hannah?

06:15.084 --> 06:15.952
Come here.

06:17.552 --> 06:18.220
I am here.

06:20.555 --> 06:21.190
To my room.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.161
Charlie.

06:25.194 --> 06:26.729
Come on.

07:34.296 --> 07:37.600
Last night I had a dream
that I was in a desert.

07:38.901 --> 07:40.302
Charlie wasn't around.

07:42.104 --> 07:46.075
I was free and I looked up

07:46.108 --> 07:48.644
and written across the
sky were these words.

08:07.930 --> 08:08.798
You know what?

08:10.232 --> 08:11.867
Why don't we just go to Mexico?

08:15.838 --> 08:17.940
What do you mean?

08:17.973 --> 08:20.009
Like, let's just go to Mexico.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.611
It's like two hours away
or something, right?

08:23.345 --> 08:24.880
What would we do?

08:26.982 --> 08:30.753
Hang on the beach,
eat tacos and stuff.

08:34.323 --> 08:35.991
It'll be fun, it'll
be like an adventure.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.762
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, why not?

08:43.799 --> 08:45.234
Okay.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.102
Okay.

08:46.135 --> 08:47.803
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:47.837 --> 08:49.038
Okay, let's go.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.339
Yeah?

08:50.372 --> 08:51.841
We're gonna go to Mexico?

08:58.347 --> 09:00.749
Wait, have you
never been to Mexico before?

09:00.783 --> 09:02.418
- No.
- What?

09:02.451 --> 09:03.819
Have you?

09:03.853 --> 09:05.254
My parents are from
Mexico. I'm Mexican.

09:05.287 --> 09:06.956
Doesn't mean you've
been to Mexico.

09:06.989 --> 09:08.724
You're not Mexican-Mexican.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.925
You didn't grow up there.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.827
I'm first-generation.

09:15.731 --> 09:17.199
Do you have any work
lined up this week?

09:17.233 --> 09:19.902
No, I don't
have any work lined up.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.103
Do you?

09:21.137 --> 09:22.805
I have that first teen
workshop on Saturday,

09:22.838 --> 09:24.940
but I'm just going to
ask Julie to cover it.

09:26.308 --> 09:28.377
What do you think the
weather's going to be like?

09:28.410 --> 09:32.681
Well, it's hot here, so
it should be hotter there,

09:32.715 --> 09:37.419
but we're going to be
by the beach, so it's...

09:37.453 --> 09:40.823
Do you like not want
to go now or something?

09:41.891 --> 09:43.125
No, I wanna go.

09:53.736 --> 09:55.004
What are you doing?
Stop, stop, stop.

09:55.037 --> 09:56.238
What are you doing? Stop!

09:57.206 --> 09:58.374
Are you kidding me?

09:58.407 --> 09:59.975
Did you just throw
the whole thing out?

10:00.009 --> 10:01.177
I don't want the
border patrol to find it.

10:01.210 --> 10:03.279
They don't inspect the cars
going in, only going out.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.880
The cameras probably saw you.

10:04.914 --> 10:07.016
- What camera-
- Ugh!

10:07.049 --> 10:08.217
- I'm sorry.
- God, Hannah.

10:08.250 --> 10:11.086
I don't
wanna go to jail.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.370
Oh, look. Right
here, right here, right here?

10:28.404 --> 10:29.738
That's where they shot Titanic.

10:29.772 --> 10:30.940
Really?

10:30.973 --> 10:32.441
Yeah.
It's like a studio.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.176
Huh.

10:59.268 --> 11:01.303
- This place is freaking dead.
- Yeah.

11:03.806 --> 11:06.942
In the daytime it's, like,
flooded with tourists.

11:06.976 --> 11:08.344
- You've been here before?
- Yeah.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.045
But like years ago.

11:10.079 --> 11:12.982
I think I was like 12, maybe?

11:13.015 --> 11:16.252
- It's like a ghost town.
- Dude, get out.

11:16.285 --> 11:18.120
- Why?
- Just get out.

11:19.188 --> 11:20.956
- Come on, get out.
- I'm going, I'm going.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.858
Go, go, go.

11:28.864 --> 11:31.000
Did
you start the car?

11:31.033 --> 11:31.967
Nope.

11:32.001 --> 11:33.502
Turn around.

11:33.535 --> 11:34.870
- What?
- Walk!

11:37.973 --> 11:38.774
Come on, go!

11:46.015 --> 11:46.482
Run, bitch!

12:16.646 --> 12:18.280
I want to show you something.

13:59.148 --> 13:59.982
Hannah.

14:55.304 --> 14:57.172
Hey.

14:57.206 --> 14:58.073
Hey.

19:05.487 --> 19:07.355
Don't show off for me.

19:36.753 --> 19:40.422
Just like that ass.

19:48.530 --> 19:49.397
Close your eyes.

19:52.735 --> 19:53.770
Spin.

19:53.803 --> 19:54.871
I'm
spinning, I'm spinning.

19:54.904 --> 19:58.708
Spin
faster, faster, faster.

19:58.741 --> 20:00.610
Faster, faster, go, go, go.

20:02.511 --> 20:05.014
Faster, faster, faster, faster.

20:05.047 --> 20:05.915
Stop.

20:10.086 --> 20:10.953
What do you see?

20:15.024 --> 20:15.892
Blue.

20:19.394 --> 20:20.295
Distance.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.603
How do you say ocean in Spanish?

20:32.141 --> 20:34.744
And how
do you say dream?

20:44.921 --> 20:46.656
Another day at the beach.

20:52.161 --> 20:53.863
Another
day, another playa.

21:05.675 --> 21:07.710
Is that we want margaritas?

21:08.611 --> 21:09.612
Uh huh.

21:09.645 --> 21:10.512
Uh huh.

21:19.622 --> 21:20.923
Hey Hannah.

21:20.957 --> 21:22.557
Hey Charlie.

21:22.592 --> 21:25.027
Does it look like
I'm taking a shit?

21:25.061 --> 21:26.394
Yeah, you do.

21:29.564 --> 21:30.700
- Oh god!
- Oh.

21:36.772 --> 21:38.774
It's like I'm a ninja.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.512
You've come to
join me at my tire.

21:47.116 --> 21:48.584
The princess.

21:48.618 --> 21:50.887
- You received my invitation.
- I have received

21:50.920 --> 21:53.789
your invitation
to eat your pussy.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.902
Look, it's us.

22:05.935 --> 22:08.137
- The dead birds?
- No.

22:08.170 --> 22:09.672
- No?
- Two love birds.

22:11.674 --> 22:13.009
But they're dead.

22:20.983 --> 22:24.086
There's no perfect
circle on your body.

22:26.488 --> 22:27.489
The nostril,

22:28.556 --> 22:29.725
the toe nail,

22:31.794 --> 22:32.662
the ankle,

22:34.063 --> 22:34.931
the heel,

22:36.799 --> 22:37.667
the mole,

22:39.735 --> 22:40.770
the ear hole,

22:42.204 --> 22:43.172
the blow hole,

22:45.041 --> 22:45.908
the gap,

22:47.777 --> 22:48.644
the O,

22:50.680 --> 22:51.513
the ass,

22:53.515 --> 22:54.617
the orangutan,

22:56.652 --> 22:57.485
the noise,

22:59.889 --> 23:00.923
the silence.

23:41.964 --> 23:43.531
When you order water,

23:43.565 --> 23:45.668
make sure it's bottled and
don't drink from the tap.

23:45.701 --> 23:49.005
Why? Am I
gonna get the shits?

23:49.038 --> 23:50.072
Yeah.

23:58.848 --> 24:00.515
How come you never
talk about boys?

24:02.218 --> 24:05.054
I don't know.

24:05.087 --> 24:06.789
Like how come
you never talk about, like,

24:06.822 --> 24:08.624
what kind of boys
you're attracted to?

24:10.226 --> 24:12.194
I don't know.

24:12.228 --> 24:13.796
Am I supposed to?

24:16.999 --> 24:17.933
I mean, I'd hope you'd share

24:17.967 --> 24:20.202
that side of yourself with me.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.739
Do you get service down here?

24:23.773 --> 24:24.907
Yeah.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.676
Why? You gotta
text your brother?

24:43.959 --> 24:46.796
It's been so long since
I've been down here.

24:46.829 --> 24:47.930
This like, little
stretch of road

24:47.963 --> 24:49.231
feels like I was just here.

24:50.232 --> 24:51.333
Reminds you of home?

24:52.835 --> 24:54.703
You haven't been here for
forever though, right?

24:54.737 --> 24:57.206
Oh my god, this is the place
where my mom got her tits.

24:57.239 --> 24:58.641
- What?
- Right here.

25:00.843 --> 25:03.179
Oh my God. Yeah, that's it!

25:05.114 --> 25:06.715
Are you serious?

25:11.420 --> 25:12.621
Hey Julie.

25:13.989 --> 25:17.259
Hannah and I are kind of
taking an impromptu trip.

25:17.293 --> 25:18.394
I won't be at the
studio tomorrow

25:18.427 --> 25:20.763
and likely not
Saturday either...

25:23.099 --> 25:25.134
Unless
you're up high enough,

25:25.167 --> 25:28.604
it's hard to see the
earth curve on the edges.

25:31.307 --> 25:35.845
I've tried breaking
up, taking space,

25:35.878 --> 25:40.216
giving time, but this
push-pull of intimacy

25:40.249 --> 25:42.718
and isolation spirals.

25:45.721 --> 25:47.823
She can't let go.

25:47.857 --> 25:49.125
I won't cut it off.

25:50.159 --> 25:51.827
I can't let go.

25:51.861 --> 25:53.229
She won't cut it off.

25:56.031 --> 25:59.368
I thought that Charlie could
be the one for a second.

26:01.137 --> 26:04.073
But the truth is that
the comfort was naive.

28:22.278 --> 28:24.113
Oh my gosh, we should
totally stay here.

28:24.146 --> 28:25.814
- No.
- It's so-

28:25.848 --> 28:28.384
- No, babe, I saw a place that
was nicer a little bit back.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.953
Nicer? It's so
colorful and kitschy.

28:30.986 --> 28:31.887
- Why not-
- Hannah, I don't wanna

28:31.920 --> 28:33.122
get bed bugs or something.

28:34.290 --> 28:35.891
- We're staying here.
- No...

28:50.873 --> 28:52.975
You know, my grandma had
a restaurant down here?

28:53.008 --> 28:55.311
- In La Paz.
- Why don't we go there?

28:55.344 --> 28:57.112
Mm-mm.
It burned down.

28:58.414 --> 28:59.515
So what
you're saying is

28:59.548 --> 29:00.916
we would have eaten there,

29:00.949 --> 29:02.418
but you weren't
feeling like toast?

29:03.552 --> 29:04.553
You're so dumb.

29:07.356 --> 29:10.959
Oh my god, some of this
dark family history.

29:13.195 --> 29:14.063
Really?

29:15.164 --> 29:16.031
I guess.

29:16.965 --> 29:19.134
Why don't you get
your own margarita?

29:19.168 --> 29:20.369
Maybe I will.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.044
You know, I've been thinking a
lot about Catholicism lately.

29:29.945 --> 29:30.613
Really?

29:31.581 --> 29:33.015
How come?

29:33.048 --> 29:34.550
I don't know.

29:34.584 --> 29:36.619
Like when I was a kid, up
until I was a teenager,

29:36.653 --> 29:38.554
I took it like super seriously.

29:42.958 --> 29:47.129
Like, I would like talk
to the Virgin Mary.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.997
Like if she was real,
like right next to me.

29:49.031 --> 29:50.299
Like an imaginary friend?

29:51.533 --> 29:53.001
Yeah.

29:55.471 --> 29:58.140
My parents didn't
treat it so personal

29:58.173 --> 30:00.376
or at least they didn't,
like, show it to me.

30:02.277 --> 30:05.047
It was more, you
know, formulaic.

30:10.419 --> 30:14.156
And then I became more
aware of the formula.

30:15.491 --> 30:18.394
Then I became more self aware
and it's like, the ritual.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.564
The Virgin Mary
was my best friend.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.168
I told her everything.

30:27.369 --> 30:28.671
About my friends,

30:30.572 --> 30:33.542
about the boys that make
fun of me at school.

30:33.575 --> 30:35.511
No.

30:35.544 --> 30:36.945
Poor little Charlie.

30:36.979 --> 30:39.582
My dreams, what I wished for,

30:40.983 --> 30:43.185
I remember begging her
to bring me a lover.

30:45.053 --> 30:47.590
I was so young,
but I remember...

30:50.159 --> 30:51.026
It wasn't a man.

30:56.064 --> 30:56.965
It was the Virgin.

31:10.647 --> 31:13.716
Your hair was shorter
when I met you.

31:15.551 --> 31:17.553
I guess I just was
dykier back then.

31:28.698 --> 31:29.965
I love you.

31:53.522 --> 31:55.023
- Cheers.
- Salud.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.195
Oh.

32:01.163 --> 32:02.030
Ugh.

32:08.203 --> 32:09.571
I have to pee.

32:09.606 --> 32:10.740
Be right back.

33:45.367 --> 33:46.836
Strong like bull.

33:48.738 --> 33:51.841
I wanna go back to Prague.

33:51.874 --> 33:53.610
I wanna travel more.

33:54.877 --> 33:59.716
I wanna show you Budapest.

34:02.184 --> 34:05.755
You know, we were
different people back then.

34:07.522 --> 34:09.592
Then we can start over.

34:12.294 --> 34:14.363
Don't forget about me.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.358
Charlie.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.562
Charlie, stop.

35:20.596 --> 35:21.731
Come on.

35:21.764 --> 35:22.699
Come on.

35:22.732 --> 35:24.634
No come on, we're going back.

35:24.667 --> 35:26.703
- I'm not gonna spin.
- Spin, spin!

35:28.738 --> 35:30.773
Okay, I'm spinning.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.274
What do you see?

35:33.575 --> 35:34.644
I see red.

35:36.579 --> 35:37.412
Red.

35:52.061 --> 35:55.798
Come on!

36:37.506 --> 36:38.373
Sit down.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.676
Come on, you look creepy.

37:43.005 --> 37:44.539
Why did you bring me here?

37:47.610 --> 37:48.878
- Why did you ask me-
- You're drunk-

37:48.911 --> 37:50.646
- To Mexico with you?

37:55.918 --> 37:57.086
I don't know.

38:02.457 --> 38:04.060
Why don't you know?

39:31.280 --> 39:34.016
Oh no, no, no, don't eat that.

39:43.826 --> 39:46.095
No, don't eat that, go away.

39:47.229 --> 39:50.166
It's not for kitties.
It's not for you.

40:27.036 --> 40:27.903
Hannah.

40:40.016 --> 40:40.850
Oh my god.

41:12.081 --> 41:12.948
Ah, babe.

41:15.217 --> 41:16.185
You're sick.

41:17.953 --> 41:18.821
You're warm.

41:24.093 --> 41:25.795
My stomach hurts.

41:27.096 --> 41:29.265
- Did you drink the water?
- I shat everywhere.

41:33.769 --> 41:35.304
Maybe when you were
brushing your teeth?

41:35.337 --> 41:36.205
No.

42:13.943 --> 42:16.278
My mom would buy me a
Gatorade when I was sick.

42:17.413 --> 42:18.781
Didn't make me feel better,

42:18.814 --> 42:20.149
but it seems to
help other people.

42:38.300 --> 42:39.235
Oh, Hannah.

42:43.005 --> 42:44.106
Move your, move your...

42:49.945 --> 42:51.714
Let's get you to bed.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.956
I always have to
act like her mother.

43:03.492 --> 43:05.227
I always had to
be my own mother.

43:06.328 --> 43:08.164
Something I finally
accepted when I realized

43:08.197 --> 43:10.366
that nobody was going
to do anything for me.

43:16.772 --> 43:17.439
Lulu.

44:49.131 --> 44:51.200
Can you
get me a piece of gum?

44:52.868 --> 44:54.069
It's in my bag.

44:56.372 --> 44:58.507
My mouth tastes like shit.

46:11.513 --> 46:12.915
For a
year I kept a tally

46:12.948 --> 46:14.316
of the bruises she'd give me.

46:15.317 --> 46:18.554
On my legs, my neck, my ass.

46:23.225 --> 46:25.027
We'd make our
experience physical,

46:26.462 --> 46:28.497
a representation
of our likeness.

46:31.567 --> 46:36.205
Her peach skin against my
olive, browning like bananas.

46:52.722 --> 46:54.923
What happens to the soul

46:54.957 --> 46:58.360
when all the contact of
force and seizure absolves?

51:33.636 --> 51:35.237
How you feelin'?

51:44.346 --> 51:45.213
Are you hungry?

51:56.391 --> 51:57.894
So I finally heard from Julie.

51:57.927 --> 52:00.228
She has to fly to
Louisiana today.

52:00.262 --> 52:01.263
Her mom broke her hip.

52:02.865 --> 52:04.232
What does that mean?

52:05.500 --> 52:06.803
It means I have
to go to the studio.

52:06.836 --> 52:07.837
I have the workshop
tomorrow night.

52:07.870 --> 52:09.639
I don't have a choice.

56:25.962 --> 56:26.829
Woo hoo.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.835
Come here, kitty.

56:36.072 --> 56:37.139
Baby?

56:37.173 --> 56:38.841
Have you seen Lu?

56:38.874 --> 56:39.742
No.

56:41.811 --> 56:43.646
Lu?

56:43.679 --> 56:44.546
Lulu?

56:50.086 --> 56:51.120
Where is she?

56:56.558 --> 56:59.028
Lu?

56:59.061 --> 56:59.929
Lu?

57:02.665 --> 57:03.531
Lulu?

57:05.101 --> 57:06.135
Hey, Lu?

57:07.670 --> 57:09.905
Lu?

57:09.939 --> 57:11.874
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

57:11.907 --> 57:13.642
- Have you seen her?
- No.

57:13.676 --> 57:14.542
Lu?

57:15.277 --> 57:16.912
Where is she?

57:16.946 --> 57:17.813
Lu.

57:17.847 --> 57:19.081
Excuse me?

57:19.115 --> 57:20.316
Have you guys seen a little cat?

57:21.183 --> 57:22.618
White and brown...

57:27.790 --> 57:29.025
Lu?

57:29.058 --> 57:29.925
Lu-Bear?

57:32.094 --> 57:33.095
Lu?

57:33.129 --> 57:34.797
Hannah.

57:34.830 --> 57:36.065
Lu.

57:36.098 --> 57:39.769
Hannah, stop.

57:39.802 --> 57:40.669
Lu!

57:42.104 --> 57:43.272
Lu!

57:43.305 --> 57:44.840
Let's just go
back to the hotel.

58:35.124 --> 58:36.826
We'll just leave
the door open.

58:36.859 --> 58:38.194
She might come back tonight.

58:40.863 --> 58:42.665
Hannah, we still need
to leave by 10, okay?

58:42.698 --> 58:43.866
We're not leaving without her.

58:43.899 --> 58:45.801
I don't want to either, but
I have to be in LA by six.

58:45.835 --> 58:47.770
If not, there's no one
to teach the workshop.

58:56.812 --> 59:00.015
Let's just go to bed. We'll
find her in the morning.

59:22.104 --> 59:23.205
Lu?

59:24.840 --> 59:25.708
Lu?

59:32.248 --> 59:33.115
Lu?

59:34.817 --> 59:37.353
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!

59:40.089 --> 59:40.956
Lu?

59:47.129 --> 59:47.997
Lu?

59:49.865 --> 59:52.401
Come here kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

59:52.434 --> 59:53.302
Lu?

59:56.038 --> 59:59.275
Here kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

1:00:02.178 --> 1:00:03.045
Lu?

1:00:06.782 --> 1:00:07.449
Lu?

1:01:43.312 --> 1:01:46.248
My first
girlfriend's name was Mary.

1:01:46.282 --> 1:01:48.250
At first I kept her a
secret from my family

1:01:48.284 --> 1:01:50.185
until I realized that
they didn't care.

1:01:53.355 --> 1:01:55.924
And at that same
moment I came out

1:01:55.958 --> 1:01:58.861
I realized I was over
her and moved on to Fay

1:01:58.894 --> 1:02:02.331
then Cassie and
Joanne, then Jeff.

1:02:02.364 --> 1:02:03.299
She's a man now.

1:02:04.433 --> 1:02:05.868
And apparently was
when we were dating,

1:02:05.901 --> 1:02:07.036
but they never told me.

1:02:17.012 --> 1:02:18.615
None of my past
girlfriends ever seemed

1:02:18.648 --> 1:02:21.083
to what they were doing
when we were together,

1:02:22.217 --> 1:02:23.385
but they all seem
to figure it out

1:02:23.419 --> 1:02:25.321
sometime shortly
after we broke up.

1:02:27.657 --> 1:02:29.958
Somehow I'm the
common denominator

1:02:29.992 --> 1:02:33.228
to their self discoveries while
I've never had to question

1:02:33.262 --> 1:02:35.431
anything about what
I'm doing or who I am.

1:02:36.666 --> 1:02:37.866
My name is Charlie.

1:02:38.567 --> 1:02:40.903
I co-own my own business.

1:02:40.936 --> 1:02:42.271
My favorite food is pizza.

1:02:43.305 --> 1:02:45.107
I quit smoking three times.

1:02:46.442 --> 1:02:48.510
I know where I'll build
my future house in Malibu.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:52.214
I'll never have children,

1:02:54.183 --> 1:02:56.485
and I'll never let another
girl string me along

1:02:56.518 --> 1:02:59.088
because she's too afraid
to tell me how she feels.

1:03:09.398 --> 1:03:11.634
I've never been afraid
to tell anyone anything

1:03:13.168 --> 1:03:15.504
until Hannah came along
and fucked up my flow.

1:06:04.106 --> 1:06:04.774
Hm.

1:06:33.803 --> 1:06:34.837
Hola.

1:06:34.871 --> 1:06:35.738
Um...

1:06:55.858 --> 1:06:57.559
Bebo's
nephew was planning

1:06:57.594 --> 1:06:59.561
to go to Tijuana in the morning,

1:06:59.596 --> 1:07:01.330
but he offered to
take me tonight.

1:07:02.599 --> 1:07:04.734
I usually have a
hard time being able

1:07:04.767 --> 1:07:06.669
to tell if someone's
attracted to me,

1:07:07.569 --> 1:07:10.305
but I could tell that he was

1:07:10.339 --> 1:07:13.208
by the way he was
nervous at first.

1:07:13.241 --> 1:07:15.277
He would lean away from me

1:07:15.310 --> 1:07:17.212
whenever he would
look my direction.

1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:20.515
I thought it was cute
because it reminded me

1:07:20.549 --> 1:07:24.587
of farting on Charlie and
how mad it would make her.

1:07:27.222 --> 1:07:29.157
I don't know what I
would do without you.

1:07:33.395 --> 1:07:35.397
- Uh...
- Why are you in San Quintin?

1:07:35.430 --> 1:07:38.433
Um, I came down
with my girlfriend.

1:07:38.467 --> 1:07:40.435
We were traveling and uh,

1:07:40.469 --> 1:07:42.772
- she just had to go back early.
- Oh.

1:07:45.808 --> 1:07:46.676
Alone?

1:07:47.877 --> 1:07:50.178
Uh, yeah I'm alone.

1:07:50.212 --> 1:07:52.514
She had, she had to
go back for work.

1:07:52.547 --> 1:07:53.448
Yeah.

1:07:53.482 --> 1:07:54.784
We actually broke up, so...

1:07:54.817 --> 1:07:55.685
Oh.

1:07:56.551 --> 1:07:58.888
Sorry to hear that.

1:08:00.823 --> 1:08:02.592
You're, you're from Los Angeles?

1:08:02.625 --> 1:08:04.794
Yeah, yeah,
I'm from Los Angeles.

1:08:05.762 --> 1:08:06.896
Oh cool.

1:08:06.929 --> 1:08:07.730
Have you
been there before?

1:08:07.764 --> 1:08:09.231
Oh, yeah.

1:08:09.264 --> 1:08:10.733
- I love Los Angeles.
- Really?

1:08:10.767 --> 1:08:11.768
Yeah.

1:08:11.801 --> 1:08:12.935
Cheers.

1:08:12.969 --> 1:08:18.173
Salud.

1:08:19.709 --> 1:08:21.276
Yeah?

1:08:21.309 --> 1:08:22.679
It's actually really sweet.

1:08:23.813 --> 1:08:24.981
- It feels strong-
- Yeah.

1:08:25.014 --> 1:08:26.481
- At the same.
- It's got a bite

1:08:26.515 --> 1:08:28.584
at the end of it.

1:08:28.618 --> 1:08:30.218
No, it's really good.

1:08:30.252 --> 1:08:31.654
Yeah, it's nice.

1:08:32.622 --> 1:08:33.589
And...

1:08:33.623 --> 1:08:35.725
You know, it's
so funny because

1:08:35.758 --> 1:08:36.993
right before I met Charlie,

1:08:37.026 --> 1:08:39.629
I was kinda feeling
like I was finally

1:08:39.662 --> 1:08:41.631
ready to start dating a guy.

1:08:41.664 --> 1:08:43.365
Not like a guy in particular,

1:08:44.466 --> 1:08:46.435
but I just had never
been with a guy.

1:08:46.468 --> 1:08:48.604
- Oh?
- And I joined

1:08:48.638 --> 1:08:51.808
some dating apps to
try and meet some guys,

1:08:51.841 --> 1:08:54.342
but I didn't want it
to be cheap, you know?

1:08:54.376 --> 1:08:56.578
Well, you know, 'cause like
a lot of apps are like...

1:08:56.612 --> 1:08:57.680
Oh, no, no.

1:09:03.318 --> 1:09:04.587
You wanna dance?

1:09:04.620 --> 1:09:06.889
Sure.

1:12:08.838 --> 1:12:11.040
A girlfriend
once sent me a note:

1:12:12.808 --> 1:12:16.411
even the harshest places
in nature are perfect.

1:12:18.214 --> 1:12:21.784
Stasis leaves flowing water,

1:12:23.085 --> 1:12:26.022
camera moves, you move.

1:12:26.055 --> 1:12:27.857
Nature undulates.

1:12:32.194 --> 1:12:34.764
At 23 I'm beginning to recognize

1:12:34.797 --> 1:12:37.033
my patterns of inconsistency,

1:12:38.533 --> 1:12:42.071
the ebb and flow of reaching
out and going inward.

1:12:43.205 --> 1:12:45.775
My clumsy hands
too often reckless

1:12:45.808 --> 1:12:47.610
when feeling around in the dark,

1:12:49.845 --> 1:12:53.649
I'm still largely ignorant
to the history here.

1:12:53.683 --> 1:12:56.118
I just see what is
visible on the surface.

1:12:57.687 --> 1:13:01.590
Agriculture, low-income
families living in homes,

1:13:01.624 --> 1:13:05.761
amid various states of
completion and disrepair,

1:13:05.795 --> 1:13:10.666
abandoned half-constructions,
dogs without tags,

1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:14.670
cactus, wildlife, open roads.

1:13:16.939 --> 1:13:18.841
The tranquil environment,

1:13:18.874 --> 1:13:22.078
the hum of the local
birds and bugs,

1:13:22.111 --> 1:13:25.181
our neighbor's generator
lull me into a trance

1:13:25.214 --> 1:13:27.750
in the evening's setting sun,

1:13:27.783 --> 1:13:32.520
soothe me, rest my speeding
heart, my scattered mind,

1:13:32.554 --> 1:13:34.790
my anxious palpitations,

1:13:34.824 --> 1:13:38.661
my chest, breasts
and grass and sand

1:13:38.694 --> 1:13:39.862
and the dimming pastel,

1:13:39.895 --> 1:13:45.101
infinity turns starlight, my
whole body upon the ground.

1:13:46.568 --> 1:13:48.671
The spirits here are rooted
in the depths of that

1:13:48.704 --> 1:13:53.575
which is beneath and around
and within and above my soul,

1:13:53.609 --> 1:13:58.614
it spreads beyond my flesh
into the sand and shrubs

1:13:59.749 --> 1:14:01.684
and wet air of this
coast, this young coast,

1:14:01.717 --> 1:14:06.722
10,000 years in eternity
and eternity is here.

1:14:11.694 --> 1:14:16.699
And I feel this now and
I feel this now, now,

1:14:17.833 --> 1:14:20.169
now I feel I've
always felt this.

1:14:20.202 --> 1:14:23.672
I've always moved as
it has and always will,

1:14:23.706 --> 1:14:27.810
despite awareness,
operates eternal fluid

1:14:27.843 --> 1:14:29.779
through chaos and calm.

1:14:30.846 --> 1:14:34.350
As stasis of renewal
and destruction,

1:14:34.383 --> 1:14:37.153
entropy and evolution,

1:14:37.186 --> 1:14:41.090
my mind dissolving
into infinite feeling,

1:14:41.123 --> 1:14:46.128
being, swing-step and deeper,
deeper, lighter, lighter,

1:14:47.730 --> 1:14:50.332
fertile mind, fertile heart,

1:14:50.366 --> 1:14:55.171
beat water waves crash
in sensuous abandon.

1:14:55.204 --> 1:14:59.775
The borders of geography,
the borders of nationality,

1:14:59.809 --> 1:15:03.279
the borders of identity,
the weight of masculine

1:15:03.312 --> 1:15:07.183
and feminine immeasurable
along the shore.

1:15:07.216 --> 1:15:11.353
It's pandrogeny of
eternity with clear coitus

1:15:11.387 --> 1:15:15.858
where one does not end
and one does not begin.

1:15:15.891 --> 1:15:20.896
Without ceremony, all
a symbol, all as it is

1:15:22.264 --> 1:15:26.368
and where it is, my body,
my body, my body, my body.

1:15:27.203 --> 1:15:29.071
Aye, aye.

1:15:29.105 --> 1:15:30.973
Aye, aye.

1:15:31.006 --> 1:15:32.708
No, no.

1:15:32.741 --> 1:15:33.609
No, no.

1:15:34.777 --> 1:15:35.644
Is, is.

1:15:36.712 --> 1:15:37.379
Is, is.

1:15:38.380 --> 1:15:39.248
Oh, oh.

1:15:40.249 --> 1:15:41.117
Oh, oh.

1:15:42.384 --> 1:15:43.285
Some, some.

1:15:44.286 --> 1:15:49.291
Some, some.
