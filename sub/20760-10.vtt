00:04.850 --> 00:07.293
"There once was a serpent...

00:07.318 --> 00:09.840
"who only traveled one direction.

00:09.865 --> 00:12.824
"Always forward, never backward.

00:12.849 --> 00:14.542
"Until one day,

00:14.567 --> 00:17.020
the serpent came upon a demon."

00:17.045 --> 00:18.239
Where is she?

00:18.264 --> 00:19.264
Deeper in.

00:19.295 --> 00:21.085
Near the crypts.

00:23.364 --> 00:24.980
What's she look like?

00:25.005 --> 00:27.215
They say she's pale. Like a corpse.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.595
Black eyes hidden behind
long, stringy hair.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.596
Like in one of those
Japanese ghost movies.

00:35.637 --> 00:36.637
In there.

01:21.230 --> 01:23.130
Boo!

01:23.232 --> 01:25.432
Oh.

01:26.502 --> 01:29.970
Aw, hell. Just a bloody bag lady.

01:30.072 --> 01:31.505
Huh.

01:31.607 --> 01:33.507
Chocolate ones are good.

01:33.609 --> 01:36.510
We heard you're a spook, not a squatter.

01:36.612 --> 01:38.212
I'm a lot of things, kiddo.

01:38.314 --> 01:39.646
Brainiac mental patient,

01:39.748 --> 01:42.182
CEO/corporate terrorist,

01:42.284 --> 01:43.917
future-psychic gypsy pirate,

01:44.019 --> 01:46.119
but I ain't no squatter, bro.

01:46.222 --> 01:49.122
Okay? I own this place now.

01:49.225 --> 01:50.991
Took me forever to find it.

01:51.093 --> 01:52.326
It's complete shite.

01:52.428 --> 01:54.495
Why do you want it?

01:54.597 --> 01:57.364
We all have a purpose.

01:57.466 --> 01:59.166
I'm supposed to be here.

01:59.268 --> 02:00.634
Fate's a real bitch that way...

02:00.736 --> 02:02.569
Rarely puts you up at the Ritz.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.607
Any day now!

02:06.709 --> 02:08.609
What are you waiting for?

02:08.711 --> 02:11.612
A dying man.

02:11.714 --> 02:14.314
I think you're too late, lady.

02:14.416 --> 02:17.317
Or too early.

02:17.419 --> 02:19.052
All right, shitheads.

02:19.154 --> 02:21.388
Get out of here!

02:21.490 --> 02:23.390
Off to Hogwarts with ya!

02:43.546 --> 02:47.214
Here's Johnny!

03:16.645 --> 03:18.946
Athan...

03:19.048 --> 03:21.148
Mother,

03:21.250 --> 03:23.650
Father.

03:23.752 --> 03:26.820
After all this time,

03:26.922 --> 03:28.622
here we are together...

03:30.726 --> 03:32.960
at the end.

03:33.062 --> 03:35.162
We're not here to hurt you.

03:35.264 --> 03:36.496
This time.

03:38.467 --> 03:40.567
You're too late.

03:40.669 --> 03:43.437
What's done cannot be undone.

03:43.539 --> 03:45.472
I feel nothing for you.

03:47.843 --> 03:50.210
And there is nothing
in morality or causality

03:50.312 --> 03:52.813
to stop me from killing you.

03:52.915 --> 03:54.615
So go live your lives.

03:54.717 --> 03:57.684
What little you have left of them.

03:57.786 --> 03:59.886
Eliza wouldn't want you to do that.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.356
You may have given me my name, Mother.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.358
You will not take hers.

04:06.328 --> 04:08.095
Mind yourself.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.099
I remember when you came to me.

04:14.737 --> 04:16.503
You tried to save her.

04:16.605 --> 04:18.538
Again and again.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.510
Your red forest...

04:25.648 --> 04:29.049
No, Athan, it's not salvation.

04:29.151 --> 04:31.251
- It's...
- The death of a thief!

04:35.157 --> 04:37.257
Your words, Mother.

04:37.359 --> 04:39.159
Not mine.

04:39.261 --> 04:41.261
I wanted to be blind.

04:43.365 --> 04:45.265
I didn't want to witness...

04:47.369 --> 04:49.269
but for her...

04:51.674 --> 04:53.740
For her, I will return to Titan.

04:53.842 --> 04:56.710
No. You have a choice.

04:59.515 --> 05:01.948
Tender words spoken by a
man just years removed from

05:02.051 --> 05:04.151
picking the bones of
those weaker than he.

05:05.921 --> 05:09.356
I've denied what I'm supposed to be.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.358
Vile.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.360
Lost.

05:13.462 --> 05:15.362
Lonely.

05:15.464 --> 05:18.231
Angry.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.233
It never felt like me.

05:23.338 --> 05:26.273
But today, it does.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.775
And you can't stop me.

05:28.877 --> 05:30.403
- Cassie...
- Synchronized.

05:30.457 --> 05:31.845
Now.

05:38.587 --> 05:39.519
Clever.

05:52.968 --> 05:54.868
- What is it?
- We have new movement.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.470
- Where?
- London!

05:56.572 --> 05:58.238
I have multiple time signatures.

05:59.508 --> 06:00.407
They found him.

06:10.552 --> 06:11.551
Shit.

06:11.653 --> 06:13.120
Hold!

06:15.724 --> 06:17.157
There!

06:18.761 --> 06:20.360
God save the king.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.924
- When are we?
- It's The Blitz.

06:53.729 --> 06:56.029
- Where is he?
- He didn't splinter.

06:56.131 --> 06:58.231
He's gotta be here somewhere.

07:00.135 --> 07:02.169
Cole.

07:04.072 --> 07:06.006
You'll have seconds to save her.

07:06.108 --> 07:07.741
Or you can follow me.

07:07.843 --> 07:09.609
It's really up to you.

07:09.711 --> 07:11.611
No, no!

07:18.220 --> 07:20.520
We lost them.

07:20.622 --> 07:21.855
What happened?

07:21.957 --> 07:22.956
Dr. Railly's signature just vanished!

07:23.058 --> 07:24.491
What about the other two?

07:24.593 --> 07:26.259
We don't know their temporal signature.

07:26.361 --> 07:28.662
We only had the one
suit in our possession.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.931
So we can't track them anymore?

07:31.033 --> 07:33.934
Are you still locked on?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.936
Yeah.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.704
We go tandem.

07:37.806 --> 07:39.239
We can't just keep chasing him.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.525
You let her die?

08:03.565 --> 08:05.265
You've stopped nothing.

08:05.367 --> 08:07.334
- I will return home.
- You're right.

08:11.740 --> 08:13.506
So what do we do now?

08:13.609 --> 08:15.175
Mother?

08:15.277 --> 08:17.978
Listen to the voice of
your daughter, Katarina.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.980
You're a mother. Now think like one.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.381
The Guardians are gone.

08:21.483 --> 08:24.317
James and Cassandra
have found their son.

08:24.419 --> 08:26.319
What would you do?

08:26.421 --> 08:27.721
Where would you go?

08:31.526 --> 08:32.525
Somewhere safe.

08:37.499 --> 08:38.398
Somewhere...

08:43.972 --> 08:46.406
The lions are taking their
cub back to their den.

08:56.836 --> 08:59.453
There is place sacred to
the men like my brother...

09:00.559 --> 09:02.192
Their home.

09:02.273 --> 09:04.173
A house.

09:04.275 --> 09:05.908
Of cedar and pine.

09:06.011 --> 09:07.777
The origin of the Witness.

09:07.879 --> 09:10.780
The moment itself
exists outside causality.

09:10.882 --> 09:12.915
The house is real, right?

09:13.018 --> 09:14.790
Yes.

09:16.021 --> 09:17.320
Where?

09:17.422 --> 09:19.689
I can give you the location,

09:19.791 --> 09:21.391
but for the exact when...

09:23.695 --> 09:24.994
I'll need something from you.

09:43.682 --> 09:45.615
Why don't you sit down,

09:45.717 --> 09:47.517
make yourself at home?

09:47.619 --> 09:50.353
When are we exactly?

09:50.455 --> 09:52.989
December 26, 1959.

09:54.192 --> 09:57.160
Right after I undid our lives here.

09:57.262 --> 09:59.362
This would've been your home.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.666
Chased through time by sentimentalists.

10:07.806 --> 10:10.006
Sit down, you little shit.

10:17.649 --> 10:20.583
So what happens now?

10:20.685 --> 10:22.585
A scolding?

10:22.687 --> 10:25.621
A lecture, perhaps.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.223
I'm about to be talked wit and wisdom

10:27.325 --> 10:29.225
by two people younger and
less traveled than myself.

10:29.327 --> 10:31.060
There's a turnout for the books.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.965
I thought you were inevitable.

10:37.736 --> 10:40.670
Written.

10:40.772 --> 10:43.973
Every little kick was like...

10:45.376 --> 10:48.311
a knife in my heart.

10:51.216 --> 10:54.417
When you left me, I felt...

10:56.321 --> 10:58.054
free.

11:03.895 --> 11:06.395
But then I saw you.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.798
Only for a second.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.667
You were crying.

11:11.770 --> 11:13.669
And small.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.274
And I knew that you were...

11:18.376 --> 11:19.609
Good?

11:21.713 --> 11:24.614
Nothing.

11:24.716 --> 11:26.949
You were nothing.

11:28.586 --> 11:30.520
Not yet.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.692
Whoever you are today

11:36.795 --> 11:39.662
is not who you have to be tomorrow.

11:41.666 --> 11:42.899
Tomorrow?

11:44.669 --> 11:46.569
Tomorrow?

11:47.872 --> 11:49.572
But that's all I know.

11:49.674 --> 11:52.775
That's all Magdalena
and Sebastian taught me.

11:54.379 --> 11:57.480
"Tomorrow, you will do such things."

11:59.384 --> 12:01.751
There is nothing that you
can say or do, either of you,

12:01.853 --> 12:05.121
that will undermine my decision.

12:09.894 --> 12:11.794
What are you doing?

12:13.898 --> 12:15.653
Stop.

12:16.234 --> 12:18.267
We've been here before,

12:18.369 --> 12:20.069
you and I.

12:20.171 --> 12:21.871
History's full of second chances.

12:21.973 --> 12:23.272
So get it right this time.

12:23.374 --> 12:25.070
Pull the trigger, or
I will kill you both.

12:25.164 --> 12:26.508
No.

12:26.978 --> 12:29.879
Please. Please, I'm begging you.

12:40.692 --> 12:42.625
Whatever love you have for her

12:42.727 --> 12:45.328
is the reason that you
must pull the trigger.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.363
Please.

12:49.734 --> 12:50.967
Cole...

12:51.069 --> 12:52.501
Do it.

12:54.472 --> 12:56.706
Cole, don't!

12:56.808 --> 12:58.708
Cole?

13:03.982 --> 13:06.916
None of us are getting off that easy.

13:07.018 --> 13:09.652
Pathetic.

13:09.754 --> 13:12.188
You had your chance.

13:12.290 --> 13:14.457
Could've gone out... one blink.

13:14.559 --> 13:16.559
One happy family, time victorious.

13:18.363 --> 13:20.997
Now I will take back
all the might've-beens

13:21.099 --> 13:23.466
time has stolen from us.

13:28.773 --> 13:30.673
It's been decades since I've done this,

13:30.775 --> 13:33.175
but this is how we were
able to communicate with him.

13:34.312 --> 13:36.045
The Witness of the future?

13:36.147 --> 13:38.314
The one who has already
returned to Titan.

13:38.416 --> 13:41.517
The Witness who gave
us orders through time.

13:41.619 --> 13:43.853
He will try and stop me.

13:43.955 --> 13:46.989
When are you gonna reach
your threshold for batshit?

13:47.091 --> 13:49.525
You want to send her consciousness

13:49.627 --> 13:51.594
up the time stream?

13:53.631 --> 13:55.564
Can you find them?

13:55.667 --> 13:57.667
Yes.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.636
Then proceed.

14:36.274 --> 14:38.741
Where are you right now?

14:38.843 --> 14:40.810
When?

14:40.912 --> 14:41.877
Show me.

15:05.336 --> 15:07.236
Sit down.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.438
Make yourself at home.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.108
When is this moment?

15:14.078 --> 15:16.979
When are we exactly?

15:17.081 --> 15:20.516
December 26, 1959.

15:22.153 --> 15:24.053
Right after I undid our lives here.

15:24.155 --> 15:26.055
This would've been your home.

15:56.421 --> 16:00.489
I know when they are.

16:00.591 --> 16:02.992
Oh, no.

16:03.094 --> 16:04.927
It's now. It's here. The end.

16:06.964 --> 16:08.831
They're coming for me.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.133
For you.

16:12.737 --> 16:15.771
Ready the machine for December 26, 1959.

16:15.873 --> 16:18.040
Roughly 1900 hours. Here.

16:18.142 --> 16:19.642
Mr. Deacon and I shall go.

16:19.744 --> 16:23.045
Hannah, we need a team of your best.

16:23.147 --> 16:25.381
Let's go! Grab your weapons.

16:25.483 --> 16:28.584
Thank you for everything.

16:30.922 --> 16:33.222
I'm afraid I can't leave
you here unattended.

16:35.193 --> 16:37.093
I understand.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.367
Initiate splinter sequence.

16:51.008 --> 16:52.908
You're in great danger.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.178
Nothing is written.

16:58.616 --> 17:02.184
When I was in Titan, there was a room...

17:03.588 --> 17:05.354
filled with pieces of your life.

17:12.997 --> 17:14.896
It's broken.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.898
It's stuck.

17:22.874 --> 17:24.906
She gave it to you

17:25.009 --> 17:27.943
to remind you that... There's only now.

17:29.147 --> 17:31.046
There's only today.

17:47.131 --> 17:48.063
Too late.

18:03.614 --> 18:05.881
Cassie?

18:05.983 --> 18:07.883
We're okay.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.919
Mr. Cole!

18:25.038 --> 18:27.359
So this is all that is left for us.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.009
Killing one another for what we believe?

18:32.796 --> 18:35.363
When I first met you, I had nothing.

18:35.409 --> 18:38.204
You're the one who gave
me something to believe in.

18:38.229 --> 18:39.528
Yes!

18:39.608 --> 18:41.374
That the life of one is not worth

18:41.399 --> 18:43.332
that of seven billion.

18:44.579 --> 18:45.812
Was to you.

18:45.914 --> 18:47.814
Deacon still hasn't splintered in.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.682
Something wrong with the machine?

18:49.784 --> 18:51.417
We can't wait for him.

18:51.519 --> 18:53.086
This ends today.

18:53.188 --> 18:54.644
Cass...

18:55.690 --> 18:57.090
What are you doing?

18:57.192 --> 19:00.293
- Upgrading.
- Just use the bloody suit.

19:00.395 --> 19:02.228
They'll never stop chasing us.

19:02.330 --> 19:03.896
Mr. Cole!

19:03.999 --> 19:06.633
What happens next happens last.

19:07.869 --> 19:09.569
Listen to me.

19:09.671 --> 19:11.571
These people are you family.

19:11.673 --> 19:14.135
You've known them a lot longer than I.

19:14.676 --> 19:16.209
Let me go.

19:17.479 --> 19:19.379
I never knew my mother.

19:19.481 --> 19:22.382
My dad used to say a thing...

19:22.484 --> 19:24.384
"The only failure is giving up."

19:24.486 --> 19:26.386
What shall it be, Mr. Cole?

19:32.494 --> 19:33.793
You can't have him!

20:31.453 --> 20:33.419
I told you.

20:33.521 --> 20:35.722
My family have come for me.

20:40.028 --> 20:41.928
They're coming for him.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.931
No matter what happens,
we have to stop him.

20:47.235 --> 20:48.468
Now!

20:56.277 --> 20:57.543
Cole?

21:11.993 --> 21:14.594
What are you doing?

21:14.696 --> 21:16.162
Go someplace safe.

21:17.398 --> 21:18.731
Whoa! Hey...

21:36.684 --> 21:38.951
Jones...

21:40.822 --> 21:42.688
I'm begging you.

21:42.791 --> 21:45.558
Mother to mother.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.860
Don't do this.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.801
Hannah...

21:57.272 --> 21:59.472
I'm sorry.

21:59.574 --> 22:01.440
Athan!

22:16.658 --> 22:18.891
We're still here.

22:23.565 --> 22:25.798
What have we done?

22:34.542 --> 22:36.342
Don't come back for me.

22:39.113 --> 22:40.546
Cassandra!

22:42.650 --> 22:44.851
Cassandra, come out!

22:52.961 --> 22:54.594
Did you find your son?

22:54.696 --> 22:56.229
Yes, but...

22:57.632 --> 22:59.065
he was shot.

22:59.167 --> 23:00.333
The suit malfunctioned,

23:00.435 --> 23:01.968
I think it triggered immolation,

23:02.070 --> 23:03.870
but we can go back.

23:03.972 --> 23:06.038
- Use Titan to...
- The Witness...

23:07.308 --> 23:08.875
is dead?

23:10.311 --> 23:12.578
Yes.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.913
Good.

23:17.018 --> 23:18.918
You wanted me to save him.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.186
No.

23:20.288 --> 23:22.388
I wanted you to find him.

23:23.691 --> 23:25.091
Take them.

23:25.193 --> 23:27.627
Burn down the house.

23:27.729 --> 23:29.629
It's served its purpose.

24:02.430 --> 24:03.829
Olivia...

24:14.648 --> 24:16.327
Olivia.

24:16.352 --> 24:18.056
How?

24:22.372 --> 24:25.097
You told me the Witness
would always be there for me.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.160
You lied.

24:30.965 --> 24:33.232
I'm afraid I can't leave
you here unattended.

24:34.602 --> 24:36.802
I understand.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.373
Initiate splinter sequence.

24:48.783 --> 24:51.016
Match coordinates.

24:51.118 --> 24:53.018
Follow sequence.

24:55.122 --> 24:57.022
The Daughters...

24:58.726 --> 25:01.427
A rather maudlin name
for a tribe of savages,

25:01.529 --> 25:03.429
don't you think?

25:06.934 --> 25:09.134
Mr. Deacon?

25:18.279 --> 25:20.379
Mr. Deacon, is something wrong?

25:23.718 --> 25:24.883
Agh!

25:24.986 --> 25:26.485
That is not a woman.

25:26.587 --> 25:28.087
It's a chameleon.

25:28.189 --> 25:31.290
Whatever you see is what
she wants you to see.

25:33.060 --> 25:34.960
That isn't someone
who's ever been anywhere

25:35.062 --> 25:36.295
she didn't want to be.

25:37.698 --> 25:39.465
Is that what you think I'm doing here?

25:39.567 --> 25:40.866
Playing God?

25:40.968 --> 25:42.601
Playing God lacks ambition.

25:42.703 --> 25:45.504
Why play at something when
you can simply become it?

25:46.674 --> 25:47.906
It's unnatural.

25:48.009 --> 25:50.075
No one should have strength like this.

25:52.179 --> 25:54.079
This isn't science; it's witchcraft.

25:57.218 --> 25:59.618
Fire alarm.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.986
Olivia's cell.

26:02.423 --> 26:04.523
Nothing stays in a box forever.

26:08.496 --> 26:10.462
There's an expression I'm fond of...

26:12.066 --> 26:13.665
One I teach those who follow me.

26:14.935 --> 26:16.635
We honor time...

26:16.737 --> 26:17.703
With patience.

26:19.206 --> 26:20.973
That's what this was?

26:21.075 --> 26:22.975
Just a long con.

26:24.478 --> 26:27.513
I asked you: What were you made to be?

26:28.983 --> 26:30.883
Agh!

26:30.985 --> 26:32.885
Look what they've turned you into.

26:32.987 --> 26:35.888
Weak. Small.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.891
Everything that you
are is wasted on them.

26:40.361 --> 26:41.593
Not on me.

26:58.045 --> 26:59.978
I can give you the location.

27:00.081 --> 27:02.281
But for the exact when,

27:02.383 --> 27:04.483
I'll need something from you.

27:14.395 --> 27:16.495
Initiate splinter sequence.

27:32.746 --> 27:34.012
It worked?

27:34.115 --> 27:35.547
I found him.

27:42.156 --> 27:43.922
At last, the day is upon us.

27:44.024 --> 27:45.791
The hour of reckoning.

27:45.893 --> 27:47.826
The moment of return.

27:47.928 --> 27:50.295
And I know that many of
you have doubted and feared

27:50.397 --> 27:53.432
and waited in great anticipation
in this timeless place,

27:53.534 --> 27:55.334
but wait no more.

27:55.436 --> 27:57.336
For the Witness has returned.

28:17.458 --> 28:18.891
Please.

28:18.993 --> 28:20.893
Show me your face.

28:57.383 --> 28:59.501
Katarina shot Athan Cole

28:59.526 --> 29:02.994
just as his suit initiated immolation.

29:02.996 --> 29:04.996
We have confirmed the sequence.

29:04.998 --> 29:07.745
The Witness is dead.

29:10.804 --> 29:13.004
Not long ago, I stood on a hill

29:13.006 --> 29:15.740
and watched the skies turn red.

29:15.742 --> 29:17.409
I saw the storms...

29:17.411 --> 29:20.945
My purpose... All I'd ever known...

29:20.947 --> 29:23.448
Rushing toward me.

29:23.450 --> 29:25.150
For a moment, I was humbled...

29:26.319 --> 29:28.319
and I closed my eyes,

29:28.321 --> 29:32.323
felt the winds of time against my face.

29:32.325 --> 29:33.691
And then...

29:35.028 --> 29:37.529
it washed away.

29:37.531 --> 29:40.282
Storms weren't proof
of the Witness's power.

29:40.337 --> 29:42.934
They were evidence of his failure.

29:42.936 --> 29:44.402
And I thought to myself...

29:46.072 --> 29:48.173
"Well, shit, if you want
something done right"...

29:54.047 --> 29:57.382
I was a fool to trust you.

29:57.384 --> 29:59.250
No, Katarina.

30:00.921 --> 30:04.122
You were the equal who made me better.

30:04.124 --> 30:06.124
You did what I couldn't.

30:06.126 --> 30:07.826
You killed the Witness.

30:09.429 --> 30:11.129
Ramse, Sam...

30:12.466 --> 30:13.965
It was all a game to you.

30:13.967 --> 30:16.167
Your brother was proof of concept.

30:16.169 --> 30:18.570
When you returned without him,
I knew I'd found the very weapon

30:18.572 --> 30:20.805
I needed to eliminate the Guardians.

30:22.943 --> 30:25.143
Only the mother could find the son.

30:35.222 --> 30:37.589
You were never a fool, Katarina.

30:37.591 --> 30:40.592
You were just beaten.

30:40.594 --> 30:43.795
Now I will fulfill my purpose.

30:43.797 --> 30:45.275
Free of you.

30:45.361 --> 30:47.098
- Agh!
- No!

30:50.337 --> 30:52.337
And free of him!

30:55.876 --> 30:58.576
From the beginning, the
Witness was nothing more

30:58.578 --> 31:00.578
than a dying man.

31:04.518 --> 31:06.518
The Witness shall never return.

31:25.906 --> 31:28.139
Save the dying man.

31:29.943 --> 31:31.476
Save the dying man.

31:33.013 --> 31:34.979
Save the dying man.

31:34.981 --> 31:37.015
I'm the dying man.

31:37.017 --> 31:38.283
Athan?

31:38.285 --> 31:40.752
I'm the dying man.

31:40.754 --> 31:42.086
Athan?

31:42.088 --> 31:43.421
The mausoleum...

31:43.423 --> 31:45.290
She waits for me there.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.359
Athan is the dying man.

31:49.863 --> 31:52.063
Athan is the dying man.

31:55.068 --> 31:57.001
Go get help! Go!

32:05.078 --> 32:06.744
It's okay. It's okay.

32:06.746 --> 32:08.613
I'm here. I'm here.

32:09.883 --> 32:13.084
I'm...

32:14.588 --> 32:17.911
James. Cassandra...

32:18.058 --> 32:20.058
No one's gonna die.

32:20.060 --> 32:21.392
Not them.

32:21.394 --> 32:23.394
Not you.

32:23.396 --> 32:24.929
No dying.

32:24.931 --> 32:26.397
I'm here.

32:28.201 --> 32:30.201
No dying!

32:38.244 --> 32:40.244
What is this?

32:46.586 --> 32:49.287
You're Primary. You can see time, right?

32:49.289 --> 32:50.455
Glimpses, windows.

32:50.457 --> 32:52.090
Back to front... like me.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.026
So let's fast forward.

32:55.028 --> 32:57.028
Skip to the good part.

33:01.701 --> 33:03.501
It's all right.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.203
Keep going.

33:05.205 --> 33:06.838
Just a little bit further.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.373
We can do the middle later.

33:12.579 --> 33:14.579
You're up?

33:17.317 --> 33:19.117
Thank you...

33:19.119 --> 33:22.120
for everything.

33:22.122 --> 33:24.122
It's time.

33:42.942 --> 33:44.042
No.

34:21.748 --> 34:23.781
Time to go!

34:38.297 --> 34:41.165
Just had the bloody thing fixed as well.

34:41.167 --> 34:43.701
- Athan, are you okay?
- It's just the suit.

34:45.205 --> 34:48.306
- Oh, shit.
- This is the part where we run.

35:16.603 --> 35:18.236
James, Athan, go!

35:21.641 --> 35:23.274
This is yours now.

35:23.276 --> 35:25.143
I'll hold them off.

35:25.145 --> 35:27.478
They'll kill you.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.480
This is where I'm meant to be.

35:32.485 --> 35:34.418
Athan...

35:37.490 --> 35:39.490
I wish I could've known you.

35:47.467 --> 35:49.500
Another life.

35:52.038 --> 35:53.871
Go.

35:57.410 --> 35:59.010
Come on!

35:59.012 --> 36:01.612
Come on, we're getting
out of here together.

36:01.668 --> 36:02.561
Go.

36:09.455 --> 36:12.223
- What are you doing?
- This is your window.

36:28.541 --> 36:30.808
Nothing is written.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.479
Now go.

36:35.481 --> 36:37.815
Now. Please.

36:37.817 --> 36:39.817
- Athan...
- Please, Mother, go.

36:42.689 --> 36:44.555
I'll see you soon.

36:47.093 --> 36:48.960
Go!

36:48.962 --> 36:50.628
Now!

36:52.632 --> 36:53.898
Go!

36:59.439 --> 37:00.805
Come on!

37:03.443 --> 37:04.642
Cassie, come on!

37:12.518 --> 37:14.218
All right...

37:15.388 --> 37:16.587
Let's play nice.

37:34.107 --> 37:36.340
You know, it's so hard
to tell you guys apart.

37:36.342 --> 37:37.675
Is that Roger?

37:37.677 --> 37:41.545
Where are they?

37:41.547 --> 37:43.147
Better run.

37:43.149 --> 37:44.615
You two... take him to Olivia.

37:44.617 --> 37:46.317
The rest of you, come with me.

37:52.292 --> 37:54.325
Wait!

38:00.333 --> 38:01.532
Paradox!

38:20.954 --> 38:23.854
Well, I love what you've
done with the place.

38:23.856 --> 38:26.357
It's a remarkable collection.

38:26.359 --> 38:28.693
I'm almost flattered.

38:28.695 --> 38:30.594
I've always wondered...

38:31.798 --> 38:33.431
why the mask?

38:33.433 --> 38:36.534
If you're gonna promise
death, best look the part.

38:36.536 --> 38:38.536
Now, I suppose...

38:40.573 --> 38:43.574
that's your job.

38:43.576 --> 38:47.078
Surely you've realized by now.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.280
Took me so long to see it.

38:51.417 --> 38:54.618
The thing I believed
I was meant to become...

38:58.424 --> 39:01.625
A sad, lonely, demon
at the end of time...

39:04.263 --> 39:06.263
was never me.

39:08.901 --> 39:12.803
Ensuring my own creation
meant ensuring yours.

39:12.805 --> 39:15.840
The promise of a timeless realm.

39:15.842 --> 39:17.375
The deceiver...

39:18.711 --> 39:21.245
It was always you, Olivia.

39:21.247 --> 39:22.580
What?

39:45.905 --> 39:48.939
I haven't done those things.

39:48.941 --> 39:51.475
Not yet.

39:51.477 --> 39:54.178
But you will.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.847
No.

39:56.849 --> 39:59.717
I haven't given orders
through time. I...

40:01.054 --> 40:03.754
I prayed to you.

40:03.756 --> 40:06.624
I worshipped... you!

40:06.626 --> 40:09.493
Yes.

40:09.495 --> 40:11.162
You are the Witness.

40:11.164 --> 40:13.697
No, that's where you're wrong.

40:13.699 --> 40:15.699
But I witnessed.

40:18.871 --> 40:20.905
It just took her for me to see.

40:23.076 --> 40:25.076
Life isn't measured by clocks.

40:28.081 --> 40:30.221
And though you have
an army at your back...

40:33.920 --> 40:36.954
You are alone.

40:36.956 --> 40:40.925
And that is why you will lose.

40:55.416 --> 40:57.596
This is an international multicast

40:57.674 --> 40:59.338
from the American CDC.

40:59.363 --> 41:01.187
Doctors at the Baltimore CDC

41:01.189 --> 41:03.860
are working day and night
to develop a vaccine.

41:03.977 --> 41:06.102
We won't stop until we have one,

41:06.134 --> 41:07.344
but we can't do it alone.

41:07.415 --> 41:10.115
If you're one of the immune,
you're vital to our research.

41:13.120 --> 41:15.454
The suit's repair is complete.

41:15.456 --> 41:17.990
I'm going to have to leave you now.

41:17.992 --> 41:20.526
I must return to Titan.

41:20.528 --> 41:22.861
Tonight.

41:22.863 --> 41:25.197
For James and Cassandra.

41:25.199 --> 41:27.933
You'll need them.

41:27.935 --> 41:29.935
And they'll need you.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.554
How does one stop what never began?

41:50.024 --> 41:52.257
I think you're the answer, Jennifer.

41:56.664 --> 41:58.931
I'm not like you.

42:00.201 --> 42:02.167
I can't see the whole puzzle.

42:02.169 --> 42:04.303
I don't know what all this means.

42:04.305 --> 42:06.505
You are not like me.

42:06.507 --> 42:08.540
You are better.

42:09.810 --> 42:14.179
Whatever these are... These symbols.

42:14.181 --> 42:16.415
This is your mission now.

42:39.773 --> 42:41.106
Athan Cole is dead.

42:43.110 --> 42:45.410
His cycle begets our own,

42:45.412 --> 42:47.646
and together, we will begin another.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.683
We will have our forest.

42:51.685 --> 42:53.185
Our peace.

42:53.187 --> 42:56.054
Our eternal now.

42:56.056 --> 42:59.591
I will make for you what he could not.

42:59.593 --> 43:00.792
But first...

43:02.329 --> 43:05.063
We shall destroy our
enemies where they live.

43:09.103 --> 43:11.103
You wanted the Witness to return.

43:14.642 --> 43:16.642
She has.

43:16.644 --> 43:18.010
The Witness is safe!

43:19.747 --> 43:23.782
The Witness is safe!

43:23.784 --> 43:26.198
The Witness is safe!

43:32.226 --> 43:34.793
It's the beginning...

43:34.795 --> 43:37.129
Beginning of the end.

43:37.131 --> 43:39.164
They're coming for us.

44:06.527 --> 44:10.028
When the four travelers
went in search of the witch,

44:10.030 --> 44:12.230
"she had seen them coming,

44:12.232 --> 44:15.467
and so sent the winged
monkeys after them."

44:16.637 --> 44:18.537
All right, James.

44:18.539 --> 44:20.572
Bedtime for Bonzo.

44:22.109 --> 44:24.309
Keep going.

44:24.311 --> 44:25.644
I know there's more.

44:25.646 --> 44:29.047
Yeah, there's the whole ending here.

44:30.284 --> 44:32.551
What's that?

44:34.655 --> 44:36.722
Let's see here.

44:38.592 --> 44:40.559
"There once was a serpent...

44:41.462 --> 44:43.862
"who only traveled one direction.

44:43.864 --> 44:46.898
"Always forward, never backward.

44:46.900 --> 44:48.567
"Until one day,

44:48.569 --> 44:51.803
the serpent came upon a demon."

44:55.342 --> 44:57.609
What's it mean?

44:59.179 --> 45:01.380
I don't know.

45:01.382 --> 45:03.548
I didn't write it.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.219
Who did?

45:10.658 --> 45:12.724
Your mother.
