NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.169 --> 00:05.630
You got a lot of guns in there.
You have paperwork on these?

00:05.714 --> 00:08.800
Al DiPiano. He deals 40 pieces a week.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.261
HARRY: Did Eddie tell you
why we wanted to see you, Mr. DiPiano?

00:11.928 --> 00:12.804
It slips my mind.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.973
Maybe you could help us
with some information.

00:15.473 --> 00:18.143
You mean be a snitch?

00:18.226 --> 00:20.437
My friend is parking his trailer here,

00:20.520 --> 00:21.980
and I'm watching it for him.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.773
Some people let me protect them!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.192
You listen to Dr. Jablonski. We'll bowl.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.695
And afterwards, we might have a few brews.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.821
I miss you.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.698
Oh, what about that other guy?

00:31.781 --> 00:34.659
I may not have gotten everything
I needed from you, Mick,

00:34.743 --> 00:36.661
but without you, I don't have any of it.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.915
(indistinct chattering)

00:40.999 --> 00:44.669
Item four: Lateness.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.755
People, please.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.133
Nobody likes climbing out of a warm bed.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.303
Now, I've been letting it slide
up to a point...

00:53.386 --> 00:58.266
I'm not mentioning any names,
but if a certain detective, initials HG...

00:58.349 --> 01:00.685
-(officers whooping)
-...is late one more time,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.771
I'm gonna make an entry into his...

01:02.854 --> 01:05.440
you know, maybe it's a her... jacket.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.733
Oh, Harriet...

01:06.816 --> 01:09.819
-(laughter)
-Anybody ever hear of Henry Goldblume?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.864
Yeah,<i> Lieutenant </i>Henry Goldblume.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.574
STAN: People, people, listen up.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.701
Operation Dirty Disco...

01:17.410 --> 01:20.914
continuing with Lieutenant Goldblume
and Officer Joe Coffey

01:20.997 --> 01:25.376
as waiter undercovers
at Al DiPiano's keyboard lounge.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.714
Now, this, uh... This operation
involves international weapons sales,

01:29.798 --> 01:33.551
so we got the FBI
and the IRS participating.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.844
As of today,

01:35.512 --> 01:40.517
all negotiations finally having been
completed to everybody's satisfaction.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.977
Gina Srignoli.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.813
(officers gasping, whooping)

01:44.896 --> 01:47.941
Well, she's gonna be on the inside
with a wire.

01:48.358 --> 01:52.320
Now, Detectives Mayo and Garibaldi
are gonna be on the other end,

01:52.403 --> 01:55.198
riding shotgun in the communications van.

01:55.281 --> 01:59.285
Rookie Officer Buzhardt is gonna be
going to school with Sergeant Bates

01:59.786 --> 02:00.870
until this pop is made.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.123
-You got all that?
-(officers chattering)

02:03.206 --> 02:04.457
STAN: Good, good.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.501
Item last...

02:07.418 --> 02:10.004
The bowling team
took it on the chin last night

02:10.088 --> 02:12.715
from the Emerald Emperors of Midtown.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.425
(officers booing)

02:14.509 --> 02:16.469
Silver-lining, department...

02:16.928 --> 02:19.931
the addition of Mick Belker to the team.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.850
(officers cheering, applauding)

02:21.933 --> 02:27.605
He... He is gonna be a holy terror
once he clears up the foot fouls.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.399
Also, once he starts using a bowling ball.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.650
(laughter)

02:30.733 --> 02:32.735
That's it. Let's get out there.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.029
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.656
(officers chattering)

02:42.287 --> 02:44.539
Oh, Sarge, I gotta talk to you.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.708
You need more support
from your fellows, Mick.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.710
You can't carry a team all by yourself.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.921
Yeah. Uh, I gotta quit.

02:52.755 --> 02:53.590
What?

02:54.299 --> 02:57.135
Robin Tataglia and I
are gonna start living together.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.637
Without getting married?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.098
Yeah.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.185
What's that got to do with bowling?

03:06.352 --> 03:08.396
Well, I don't wanna
mess things up this time.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.564
-You know?
-Oh.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.275
Well, it makes sense.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.611
Glad for you. It's-it's great.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.821
-I'm sorry.
-No problem, it's...

03:17.739 --> 03:19.199
It's not a one-man band.

03:19.824 --> 03:20.658
We'll...

03:22.243 --> 03:23.244
We'll adjust.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.121
Hill and Renko?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.957
Uh, you guys, robbery.
Hurdle and Jefferson parking lot.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.292
Mrs. Furillo turned it in.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.502
Natalie, is Fay getting robbed again?

03:31.586 --> 03:35.006
Uh-uh, she saw it. She scared the guy off.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.507
The woman has no fear.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.636
Uh, sir?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.512
Excuse me, sir...

03:41.596 --> 03:43.181
On the street corner of the ghetto,

03:43.806 --> 03:48.770
a tubercular child stands
and shouts at the sky!

03:49.437 --> 03:52.607
With the power of Almighty God,

03:52.690 --> 03:54.817
I will strike this world dead!

03:54.901 --> 03:58.988
At the 11th hour,
the earth will crack and break,

03:59.072 --> 04:02.158
and all the hate, and greed,

04:02.242 --> 04:05.203
and-and pornography,

04:05.286 --> 04:06.996
and the filth of the missile silos

04:07.080 --> 04:10.625
will spew out and consume all human flesh!

04:11.709 --> 04:15.672
Men will tear their eyes
out of their sockets!

04:16.339 --> 04:19.342
Mothers will murder their babies!

04:20.093 --> 04:22.929
Oh, a fatted cow will give birth

04:23.012 --> 04:25.723
to a stillborn mutant monster!

04:25.807 --> 04:27.725
And when it's finished,

04:27.809 --> 04:33.106
w-when pain and-and agony
have gorged themselves

04:33.189 --> 04:36.067
on the corruption of your bodies,

04:36.150 --> 04:40.196
why, then, the obscenity of mankind

04:40.280 --> 04:45.702
will return to its primordial vapor
of stink and vomit!

04:45.785 --> 04:47.912
(inhales) Pray!

04:49.289 --> 04:51.249
Pray for yourselves!

04:51.874 --> 04:53.251
Pray now,

04:53.334 --> 04:57.046
for the hour of your annihilation
is at hand!

04:58.673 --> 05:01.134
(man chuckling)

05:01.509 --> 05:03.970
Anyone know how to get out a jelly spot?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.848
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:06.931 --> 05:08.641
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:08.725 --> 05:12.478
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:14.230
(sirens wailing)

05:19.694 --> 05:22.322
(theme music playing)

06:20.671 --> 06:22.673
(siren wailing)

06:37.605 --> 06:39.107
She was robbed and beaten.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.150
I was coming back
from dropping a client off.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.236
The guy must have seen me,
because he took off.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
-You get a look at him yourself?
-Not really.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.239
Mrs. Furillo...

06:46.989 --> 06:48.741
Here, she gave me a description of him.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.995
Ma'am, we're police officers.
What's going on here?

06:53.079 --> 06:56.290
She's got bruises. That's about it.
Looks like the lady here saved it for her.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.709
-You wanna go to the hospital, ma'am?
-I'll be all right.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.087
PARAMEDIC: We could run x-rays,
but she doesn't wanna go.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.381
Well, then, ma'am, perhaps you'd like
to come down to the station,

07:03.464 --> 07:04.882
file a report on the mugger.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.218
I-I got my babies home, that's all.

07:07.301 --> 07:11.264
Can't y'all fill out them reports and
I'll come back and pick up my money later?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.307
Not sure what you mean about money, ma'am.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.309
Well, the woman here said I could get
money back from being robbed.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.227
Ain't that right?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.856
Well, I was explaining to her,
as a crime victim,

07:19.939 --> 07:21.566
she might be eligible for compensation.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.110
Well, you get compensation
after you fill out the report, ma'am.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.237
First things first. Got that?
First things first.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.158
I-I was explaining that to you,
Mrs. Brown, too, remember?

07:30.241 --> 07:32.910
Except I don't know
what more I'm gonna tell you.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.080
I lost my welfare check. Understand that?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.916
My welfare check and $12!

07:40.835 --> 07:41.669
Let's go.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.299
I never wanna see Mendoza files again.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.093
Well, if we get on the stand today,
maybe you might not have to, Leo.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.595
Testimony, your first day of trial?

07:50.678 --> 07:53.097
With the joke they've made out
of this nation's court system?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.224
Excuse me.
Captain Furillo is expecting us.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.769
Ah. Mr. Greenglass, Miss Srignoli,

07:58.853 --> 07:59.979
captain's office.

08:00.062 --> 08:00.897
Thank you.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.067
-Hi, detectives.
-J.D.: Hi.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.652
Still a great country, babe.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.863
-Neal, let me ask you something.
-What?

08:08.946 --> 08:10.615
If you get aroused, can you blink?

08:11.782 --> 08:12.617
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.619
My whole life, I get aroused,
I can't blink.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.661
(Neal chuckles)

08:15.745 --> 08:17.497
IRS AGENT: No, I won't go for it.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.666
It's the last straw in the shakedown,
and she doesn't get the dough.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.335
This is a judgment made by who?

08:22.418 --> 08:25.588
By me, as the field officer in charge.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.548
(door opens)

08:29.592 --> 08:30.426
Gentlemen.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.844
(door closes)

08:32.929 --> 08:34.180
GREENGLASS:
Did you relay our request, Captain?

08:34.722 --> 08:35.806
We're still discussing it.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.266
Oh, boy.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.809
-Discussing it?
-(sighs)

08:38.893 --> 08:40.228
People, it's a two-way street!

08:40.311 --> 08:42.438
This girl's done nothing
but deliver for you.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.816
Come D-Day, you ask her to wear a wire,
it could only increase her risk.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.863
Okay, we'd like early release
on a few dollars in her husband's estate,

08:51.239 --> 08:52.740
$10,000.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.493
And what's to discuss?
Where's the reciprocity?

08:56.452 --> 08:57.912
FBI has no objection.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.498
Of course,
it's not the FBI's money, is it?

09:00.915 --> 09:04.669
You know, you just<i> work</i>
for the IRS, Mr. Simpson.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.089
Sometimes I think he had
a personal hate vendetta

09:08.172 --> 09:10.216
against my late husband, Paul.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.262
Agent Simpson,
could I talk to you for a minute?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.890
We can talk till the cows come home.
That impound doesn't lift.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.811
FRANK: Excuse us for a minute,
would you, please?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.860
I don't think Mrs. Srignoli's request
is out of line.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.696
You're entitled to your opinion, Captain.

09:31.779 --> 09:32.697
Listen to me.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.157
I have a lot of people
on a high-risk undercover

09:35.241 --> 09:38.452
because somebody in your office
authorized dealing the tax liens

09:38.536 --> 09:41.414
on her husband's estate
for an operation against Al DiPiano.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.000
Maybe you weren't consulted
in that decision,

09:44.083 --> 09:45.167
or maybe you disapproved of it.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.544
Why wouldn't I approve of it?

09:46.836 --> 09:49.505
You only made a joke
out of the last 13 months of my life.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.010
Well, that joke's been played on me
a few times, too, Mr. Simpson,

09:54.844 --> 09:55.928
but the deal was made.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.098
And a lot of hours in the lives of a lot
of other people are gonna be wasted

09:59.181 --> 10:01.058
if you contradict it in execution.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.269
And I think if I called right now,

10:03.352 --> 10:05.354
whichever of your superiors
made the original deal

10:05.438 --> 10:07.064
would authorize releasing that money.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.149
Not necessary.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.319
Let's stay consistent in our stupidity.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.994
Mr. Simpson's reconsidered.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.163
To release the 10,000.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.415
FRANK: Fit Mrs. Srignoli for a mic,
would you?

10:24.498 --> 10:25.333
HARRY: Yes, sir.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.005
She's all yours.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.507
Do you have a 713 for me, officer?

10:33.591 --> 10:37.053
Yes, very complete, meaningful statement.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.012
Thank you, ma'am.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.264
I got four kids at home

10:40.348 --> 10:42.516
with a neighbor
who has four kids of her own.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.269
They wasted all my time
putting out a description of the man.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.562
What good is that gonna do?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.732
Sit. You know,
they do catch them sometimes.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.903
Please, if I got money coming, okay.
Otherwise, I gotta get back to my house.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.365
We have medical, legal,
and social services available.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.241
But I can understand your main interest.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.744
You're eligible for a reissue
of your welfare check,

11:01.827 --> 11:04.538
plus 27 percent
of your other losses and expenses.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.833
-What's your full legal name?
-I gotta fill out all them forms?

11:08.542 --> 11:09.543
Yes, Ms. Brown.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.171
Now, we can make this work,
but you're gonna have to help.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.839
Okay, okay, okay.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.383
Full name?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.385
Ruby Louise Brown.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.055
And talk.

11:22.014 --> 11:22.973
Talk, talk.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.559
I wish you could be there, Harry.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.895
Oh, that wouldn't be smart, Gina.

11:27.978 --> 11:34.068
I mean, I know Al made you
and Detectives LaRue and Washington.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.696
It was just a wish.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.241
Well, Lieutenant Goldblume
will be looking out for you.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.034
And Officer Coffey.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.787
And Officer Coffey, right.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.956
Gee, that looks so technical.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.000
Well, you barely feel it once it's on.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.210
How does it go?

11:52.294 --> 11:54.171
Pack straps underneath.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.716
Microphone hooks to your bra.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.050
Okay.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.887
I guess we better get me a bra, then.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.143
-(siren wailing)
-I lost a week's worth now.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.478
(indistinct chattering)

12:09.562 --> 12:13.357
(car horn honking)

12:15.735 --> 12:17.069
Dangerous position, right?

12:17.153 --> 12:19.321
Yeah, just be firm
and don't take any noise.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.698
-Okay, but you handle it, all right?
-Excuse me.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.325
(car horn honking)

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
Jerk runs right into me,
doesn't have a license.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.662
Dollar will get you doughnuts,

12:26.746 --> 12:28.330
he don't have a nickel's worth
of insurance.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.957
(groans) Hey, officer, I...

12:30.040 --> 12:31.917
guess my license must have lapsed, huh?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.127
Yeah, six months ago.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.420
Yo, I'm gonna catch the bus.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.088
-Hey, all right, man.
-Oh, wait a second, sport.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.047
Let me see some ID.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.092
Officer, I was just riding.
Let me make the races.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.219
A, you stink like a still.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.805
B, you remind me of someone
I just heard about on the radio.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.390
C, let me see some ID.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.019
-(car horn honking)
-(ID clatters)

12:52.605 --> 12:54.106
"Ruby Brown." You Ruby Brown?

12:54.190 --> 12:55.900
I found that. It was laying in the street.

12:55.983 --> 12:56.901
What a coincidence.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.111
She was a rob-assault victim
about an hour ago.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.238
Okay, you're under arrest.
Up against the car.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.490
You got the right to remain silent...

13:02.573 --> 13:04.241
What about this creep?
How about busting<i> him?</i>

13:04.325 --> 13:06.327
He's next. You wanna go in, too?

13:06.410 --> 13:08.329
Yeah, turn on<i> me. </i>Turn on the victim.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.914
Keep running. Keep running your mouth.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.208
I'd like to tell you
that this was first introduced

13:12.291 --> 13:14.460
in New Orleans at Bob's Hideaway...

13:14.543 --> 13:17.296
-in about 19 and 31.
-MICK: Freeze, Asshole! Freeze!

13:17.922 --> 13:19.131
(instruments clanging)

13:19.215 --> 13:21.300
Hey, you nut burger, what are you doing?

13:21.383 --> 13:23.385
Well, you've gotta stop
blocking the sidewalk.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.263
MAN: Ah, hey, hit-and-run!
Why don't you help me pick up, huh?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.723
-Come on!
-All right, that's it!

13:27.807 --> 13:30.059
-What?
-I'm a policeman, spitball.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.229
-And you are under arrest!
-Huh? Huh?

13:35.773 --> 13:40.194
"No playing near rear lots, churches,
parking lots, schools, hospitals.

13:40.277 --> 13:43.197
No playing before 9:00 a.m.
or after 1:00 a.m."

13:43.280 --> 13:46.033
Hey, why don't you guys
just shoot us on sight?

13:46.116 --> 13:47.993
Open season on the one-man band!

13:48.077 --> 13:49.495
We're freaks, right?

13:49.578 --> 13:53.040
Wipe us off the face of the earth
like the Chinese with all them dogs!

13:53.123 --> 13:53.999
Shut up!

13:54.583 --> 13:55.709
Give him the tuba.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.170
It's a sousaphone, not a tuba.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.714
-(sousaphone clangs)
-What, uh... What's the charge, Mick?

14:00.798 --> 14:02.925
Interfering with a police officer,

14:03.008 --> 14:04.802
obstructing a public thoroughfare.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.721
Persecution, humiliation, dehumanization!

14:07.805 --> 14:09.098
(Mick growling)

14:09.682 --> 14:11.517
Move, move!

14:14.019 --> 14:15.145
Sit down.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.156
Name?

14:26.240 --> 14:27.283
Sturgeon Mussel.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.744
You know, I could make a quintet
out of this desktop.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.162
That's a perfect A-flat.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.707
Get your hands off of there,
or I'll break them off at the wrist.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.378
"$21,000 or BO"?

14:39.461 --> 14:41.881
That's "best offer," Ray.
Are you interested?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.091
-Not really.
-Then you're a smart man.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.135
-I hear she's a lemon.
-(Howard chuckles)

14:46.635 --> 14:50.306
Well, reality was somewhat less
than fantasy.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.517
See, these RV dealers seem to think

14:53.601 --> 14:56.103
that they'll lose a sale
if they tell the truth.

14:56.186 --> 15:00.024
So they wrap you up
in a snare web of assurances,

15:00.107 --> 15:04.194
and empty promises,
and all kinds of flattery.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.323
Of course, you have
no protection whatsoever.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.284
I tried to sell it back to the dealer.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.619
You know what he offered me?

15:12.786 --> 15:15.581
50 cents on the dollar, the shyster.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.374
You really got to watch out
for those guys.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.792
Yes, that's right.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.210
And to the average salesman,

15:20.294 --> 15:24.423
truth and a successful sale
are mutually exclusive.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.341
Hold that.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.760
And of course, honor, well...

15:28.469 --> 15:32.932
Honor has gone the way
of the horse-drawn combine harvester.

15:33.390 --> 15:38.145
They are scavengers preying
on an unsuspecting public's wits.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.605
You make a good point, Howard.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.440
Yes. Well, it need not be so.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.816
Call, Lieutenant Hunter.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.697
Perhaps a little nibble.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.532
Lieutenant Hunter.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.035
Yes.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.620
Uh, yes, that's right.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.456
Well, the honest truth
is that I cannot provide

15:57.539 --> 15:59.667
the maintenance that these things require.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.461
I felt like that man on television

16:02.544 --> 16:06.256
who was balancing the spinning plates
on the end of a pole, I, uh...

16:06.340 --> 16:10.052
Yes, I-I repaired the electrics,
and then the plumbing would stop up,

16:10.135 --> 16:11.595
and then the brakes went out,
and the roof leaked.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.639
It was quite a barrage. (chuckles)

16:13.722 --> 16:15.265
(dial tone ringing)

16:15.349 --> 16:16.183
Hello?

16:17.017 --> 16:17.851
Mr. Pitman?

16:18.310 --> 16:19.269
Mr. Pitman?

16:20.229 --> 16:21.605
I'm a goofball, huh?

16:22.356 --> 16:23.816
Well, let me tell you something, pal.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.902
A one-man band
once saved 50 cops in this city.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.071
Uh-huh. No one ever hear about that.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.240
You never read about that
in your history books.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.910
Pike Lecray, November 17th, 1904,
the old police academy.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.913
Pike's walking by about midnight,
and he smells smoke.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.708
Pike goes in and plays
"The Thunderer" in six parts,

16:40.791 --> 16:43.669
so loud, those cops followed him
through the smoke to safety.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.421
And what does he get for his trouble?

16:45.796 --> 16:48.757
Nothing. An early grave in the poorhouse.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.635
Yeah, well, that's the way
it's always been for us.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.346
It's how it always is
for our contributions to society,

16:54.430 --> 16:56.223
they're always lost, forgotten.

16:57.057 --> 17:02.021
Who ever remembers my father, Emil Muzel,
the world's largest one-man band, 1931,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.815
played 27 instruments simultaneously?

17:04.898 --> 17:06.066
Shoulders like an oak.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.651
He was crushed to death.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.569
(scoffs)

17:09.611 --> 17:10.654
Now, how about Ed Dorfman,

17:10.738 --> 17:13.407
the guy who composed
this city's official song?

17:13.490 --> 17:17.036
Fifty years, he didn't miss one Sunday
playing for the kids in the zoo.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.538
They threw him into a jail cell
next to Lenny Bruce.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.375
And who does society remember?
A foulmouthed comic.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.046
(telephone rings, clatters)

17:27.129 --> 17:27.963
What?

17:29.631 --> 17:30.716
Hi, Ma.

17:35.137 --> 17:35.971
What?

17:37.806 --> 17:39.141
No, I can't do that.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.143
Ma...

17:42.436 --> 17:43.353
Ma.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.397
I am a 37-year-old man.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.107
If I want to live with a woman...

17:49.234 --> 17:50.486
Would you please stop?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.405
You're embarrassing me.

17:55.032 --> 17:55.866
No.

17:56.492 --> 18:00.454
You did not yell at your daughter when she
moved in with that<i> shmegegge, </i>what...

18:00.996 --> 18:03.373
Okay, okay, so they slept
in separate rooms.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.959
Maybe Robin and I will do the same thing.
I don't know.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.628
-You steal those instruments?
-Ma...

18:07.711 --> 18:10.255
No, you're stealing them from<i> me!</i>
I didn't do nothing!

18:10.798 --> 18:13.425
I'm taking charge of your man.
I'm kicking him loose.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.010
STURGEON: Justice.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.930
Uh, Ma, I gotta go.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.142
All right, just tell me you love me.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.188
Come on, tell me you love me.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.732
Come on, tell me.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.112
Good. I love you, too,
sweetheart, goodbye.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.114
-(telephone clatters)
-(chair creaks)

18:35.906 --> 18:37.741
(clarinet playing)

18:42.663 --> 18:43.622
What's going on?

18:45.457 --> 18:47.751
Maybe you left your thinking cap
at Robin Tataglia's

18:47.835 --> 18:49.253
when you came to work today.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.046
What's that supposed to mean?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.631
What am I supposed to do
with all this junk?

18:52.714 --> 18:54.133
(trumpet playing)

18:54.216 --> 18:56.760
To truck it to Division Property
will take three days.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.428
Use a little common sense, detective.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.472
He was obstructing the sidewalk.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.641
He's obstructing the squad room.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.688
Look, from now on, you toot your horns
in the park, you understand?

19:07.771 --> 19:09.606
Otherwise, I'll see that you get a cell.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.401
Hey, uh, detective, why don't you take
a musical-appreciation course?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.652
Why don't you take a bus?

19:13.735 --> 19:15.112
Leo, help him out, huh?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.738
Look at this valve. It's loose.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.448
Yeah, I could sue you guys.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.617
This was wrong.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.828
I bring a guy in and you kick him?

19:22.911 --> 19:23.912
That ain't kosher.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.956
Don't be so sensitive, detective.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.041
(sousaphone plays)

19:28.625 --> 19:30.794
Is this about me
quitting the bowling team?

19:32.421 --> 19:34.298
Bowling's got nothing to do with anything.

19:37.551 --> 19:40.554
Louis Jes sup. J-E-S-S-U-P.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.472
Suspicion of robbery and assault.

19:42.556 --> 19:46.685
File as evidence one welfare ID,
one welfare check to a Ruby Brown.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.520
Hey, so, I didn't find the check
in the street.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.813
She gave me permission to cash it.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.190
Mr. Jes sup, I'm Ms. Chapman.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.566
I'll be your public defender,

19:52.649 --> 19:56.486
and I would strongly advise
you turn your back and shut your mouth.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.199
Okay, on this one, you sign right there.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.743
Hold it. What's going on in there?

20:02.826 --> 20:04.244
Uh-uh. No way.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.580
No way what? What-What's wrong, Ruby?

20:06.663 --> 20:09.291
Mrs. Furillo, is this your complainant
on the rob-assault case?

20:09.374 --> 20:10.709
No, uh-uh.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.295
Look, we've got a suspect
we'd like to put in a lineup, ma'am.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.338
Would you come take a look?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.797
That's-That's not the man in there.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.966
Ruby, can I talk to you
in private for a minute?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.552
-There's nothing to talk about.
-Ruby, yes, there is.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.513
And if you walk out now,
I can't process this application.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.723
Come on, this way.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.685
RUBY: The check come yesterday.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.521
I wake up this morning, the check is gone,

20:32.856 --> 20:34.191
and so is Louis gone.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.362
He said it was for some tools
to buy for some job program,

20:38.445 --> 20:41.406
but I knew he'd be down
at Jackson's place.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.659
So I went down there,

20:45.118 --> 20:46.662
and that's where we had the fight.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.748
Plus, he took $12.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.959
And then<i> you </i>come into it.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.795
He's beaten and stolen from you before?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.172
Some of the time, that's so...

20:58.382 --> 20:59.800
But I know Louis loves me.

21:00.217 --> 21:04.012
Ruby, this man has committed
crimes against you.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.348
-Why not bring charges?
-What am I gonna do?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.893
I can't live with him,
and I can't without him.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.437
And I say, let's question that.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.939
I bet you can.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.232
I could help you.

21:16.024 --> 21:16.900
You can't help me.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.319
Do you want me to?

21:20.696 --> 21:23.198
Ma'am, Louis been living with me
for four years.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.076
Do you want me to help you?

21:27.703 --> 21:28.537
(sobs)

21:29.997 --> 21:31.748
Somebody gotta help me,

21:33.041 --> 21:34.835
because I can't go on like this.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.044
I can't.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.838
All right.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.339
All right.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.718
Now, there are two basic things
we have to do.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.012
First, we have to protect you.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.390
We'll get you into a battered-woman's
shelter with your children.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.643
And second, we're gonna put
that creep behind bars.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
How you gonna do that?

21:54.062 --> 21:55.230
<i>You're </i>gonna do it.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.399
You were robbed.
You'll testify against him.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.401
But the trial won't come up for months.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.486
What am I gonna do till then?

22:01.820 --> 22:06.074
Well, the judge will place a high bail,
probably $2,000 to $5,000.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.409
Can he raise that kind of money?

22:08.994 --> 22:12.873
And then, even if he gets a jail sentence
of only 30 to 90 days,

22:12.956 --> 22:15.125
that's still gonna give you
plenty of time to relocate.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.836
He ain't never been to jail before.

22:19.129 --> 22:24.343
He been busted, but he always get out
on some job program or some damn thing.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.594
Not this time.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.514
You testify, he goes to jail. Okay?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.184
Okay.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.940
(siren wailing)

22:39.024 --> 22:40.275
MAN: Straighten out the ashtrays, huh?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.611
(indistinct chattering)

22:42.694 --> 22:44.363
AL: You've got a set on you
coming in here.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.697
I got a proposition
that I want you to hear...

22:45.781 --> 22:47.074
Another proposition?

22:47.824 --> 22:51.411
Got a 72 gross of certain items
boosted by your<i> first </i>proposition.

22:51.995 --> 22:56.583
Six days into delivery,
I get, "Uncle Al, I'm so sorry.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.293
Uncle Al, I can't make the numbers."

22:58.377 --> 22:59.669
Well, I figured something out this time...

22:59.753 --> 23:02.881
I figured something out, too.
No more business with family.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.383
Uncle Al, give me one more chance.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.551
-Will you?
-I already have a firm deal elsewhere.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.680
Now you take a walk
before I do what's right to you.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.849
Uncle Al, look at my pocket.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.476
What's that supposed to mean?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.436
I'm pointing something at your belly.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.856
Now, one way or another,
you're fronting me those pieces, Uncle Al.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.858
And I'm gonna pay you back
once I move them.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.402
Now, come on.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.403
Come on where?

23:24.486 --> 23:26.530
To the basement. I know where they are.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.158
-Front way or back?
-Back door.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.077
Let's go.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.751
Everything okay, Mr. DiPiano?

23:39.835 --> 23:41.169
AL: It's okay. It's all right.

23:49.970 --> 23:50.804
(door closes)

23:52.389 --> 23:54.474
Joey, I'm gonna turn around
for a second, okay?

23:54.558 --> 23:55.392
For what?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.645
-'Cause I wanna ask you something.
-What?

23:59.104 --> 23:59.938
(gun fires)

24:02.774 --> 24:04.484
(door opens)

24:05.152 --> 24:06.528
Hey, Mr. D, you all right?

24:07.028 --> 24:07.863
Yeah.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.453
What happened?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.496
Kid shot himself.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.888
DiPiano killing the guy makes him a pop
in his own right, no question.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.265
But you still want the people he moves to.

24:35.348 --> 24:37.225
Of course what you really want
is to follow those people,

24:37.309 --> 24:38.435
see who they move to.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.272
But then you get yourself all kinds
of problems with diplomatic immunity,

24:42.355 --> 24:43.398
the whole thing could go overseas.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.775
Now, you got your hands in your shirt,
you wind up outsmarting yourself.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.403
Ramsey, I have four officers
and a civilian at risk.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.696
By my lights,
this operation could close...

24:49.779 --> 24:51.698
Captain, I'd like to go to the buy.

24:54.826 --> 24:55.660
Okay.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.121
MAN: He just stood there
while six of them robbed me!

24:58.747 --> 25:00.540
Get this, punched out a newspaper vendor,

25:00.624 --> 25:01.666
says he just stood around

25:01.750 --> 25:03.668
while a bunch of gang kids
ripped off his instruments.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.295
They took my whole kit!

25:05.378 --> 25:07.047
-Tuba, too?
-Sousaphone.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.299
-Was this on a city street?
-Yep.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.176
Put him in garden level. Book him later.

25:11.259 --> 25:13.053
Hey, it was death in the park.
There was nobody there!

25:13.136 --> 25:14.804
-Come on.
-Tell him, Buzzy!

25:15.055 --> 25:16.806
HOWARD: HM, how would I rate it?

25:18.517 --> 25:22.479
I'd put it, uh, somewhere
between good and, uh, very good.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.566
Well, uh, she has a slight tendency
to pull to one side,

25:26.650 --> 25:29.945
which is, uh, a minor glitch
in the brakes or the steering, I...

25:30.820 --> 25:33.615
Well, I-I never did, uh, get
to the bottom of it.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.909
No, it's just a matter of adjustment.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.079
Well... (sighs) because, other than that,

25:39.162 --> 25:41.790
she's the smooth-running motor coach

25:42.249 --> 25:45.252
-in every way, e-except for that little...
-(dial tone ringing)

25:45.335 --> 25:46.461
...idiosyncrasy.

25:47.754 --> 25:48.588
Hello?

25:49.339 --> 25:52.425
(metal clanging)

25:53.093 --> 25:55.679
-You got atonal cells here.
-(clangs)

25:56.846 --> 25:58.098
What's the matter with you?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.226
You know this ain't worth the trouble.

26:02.018 --> 26:06.523
(sighs) Listen, I see these kids nowadays
downtown at the civic center.

26:07.148 --> 26:10.235
They got guitar synthesizers,
percussion machines,

26:10.318 --> 26:12.237
electronic-bass pedals.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.615
(scoffs) What does it take to strap on
half a dozen computer chips?

26:16.575 --> 26:20.829
They say pretty soon, one guy will be able
to make an infinite variety of sounds

26:20.912 --> 26:22.956
with nothing but a pocket calculator.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.001
Sunset on the one-man band.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.755
I got 7, 10 good years left in these legs,
and then it's over with.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.342
I figured I could get around you guys
in the meantime.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.969
Figured I had nothin' to lose.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.013
So what's right?

26:38.680 --> 26:39.931
(Mick sighs)

26:41.683 --> 26:42.601
How's your lip?

26:43.893 --> 26:45.145
It's okay.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.731
I got behind a bass drum.
I've been mugged before.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.648
(chuckles)

26:49.691 --> 26:52.444
I'm gonna see what I can do
to get you out of here, okay?

26:52.527 --> 26:54.821
Forget about it. It's all over with.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.867
I ain't got nothing to go home to,
and I ain't fighting it no more.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.378
Well-well, the Woodlander
"R" series is, uh...

27:10.962 --> 27:13.757
Is generally considered to be
the Cadillac of motor homes.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.094
Oh, no, no, no.
"Pegasus" is-is a nickname of my coining.

27:18.178 --> 27:23.266
Uh, well, I suppose it's for
that wind-swept feeling one gets

27:23.350 --> 27:25.018
coursing the open road, it's...

27:25.977 --> 27:27.354
I see, um...

27:27.854 --> 27:28.772
Sir, if you would forgive me,

27:28.855 --> 27:31.358
I think that we are both doing
Pegasus a disservice

27:31.441 --> 27:35.195
by relying upon my poor powers
of description.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.114
Uh, why don't you see it?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.450
And-and then you can form
your own impression.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.996
Oh, yes, well, uh, I will make
four o'clock convenient.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.164
Do you have the address?

27:47.415 --> 27:49.584
(laughs) I'm looking forward
to seeing you.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.462
Anyway, he wanted you to know that.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.174
Uh, you shouldn't be talking
to Miss Brown.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.468
On the contrary,
it's her right to talk to me.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.553
She said that the judge
will set bail for Louis,

28:00.637 --> 28:03.348
but then there's another judge
later on that might change it.

28:04.057 --> 28:04.933
What are you talking about?

28:05.016 --> 28:07.686
I'm talking about regardless
of how bail is set today,

28:07.769 --> 28:09.229
later there'll be another hearing.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.147
Mr. Jes sup will get another chance.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.109
Ruby, she's just trying
to scare you off of what we're doing.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.361
I'm not trying to scare anybody.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.655
These people have a relationship.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.159
If there's problems, let's solve them.
Let's not put people in jail.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.788
(groans) Come on, Ruby.
We're due in court.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.665
He gets out, what am I gonna do then?

28:28.748 --> 28:30.875
Louis ain't stupid. He'll find me somehow.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.294
(sighs) It'll be okay.
Hey, where's your coat?

28:38.174 --> 28:39.467
You know, you shouldn't have
talked to her.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.593
Where is your conscience?

28:40.677 --> 28:43.680
Where it belongs, Ms. Furillo, in my job!

28:46.266 --> 28:47.100
HOWARD: Solid.

28:47.642 --> 28:51.271
Now, they don't build a coach
as solid as<i> this </i>today.

28:51.604 --> 28:53.565
You can have your fiberglass.

28:53.648 --> 28:56.151
For me, if it isn't aluminum,
I'm not interested.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.235
It's real nice.

28:57.318 --> 29:00.196
Ample headroom throughout, as you can see.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.865
And, oh. (laughs)

29:01.948 --> 29:04.617
Of course, that doesn't concern
a little fellow like you.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.620
But you might appreciate
the, uh, square footage here

29:07.704 --> 29:11.249
for your toys and a fishing rod
for those weekends with your dad.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.751
-It's great.
-(laughs)

29:12.834 --> 29:15.086
Has it been a good motor home
to own, Mr. Hunter?

29:15.754 --> 29:20.425
Well, uh, I am, uh,
hopelessly prejudiced, Mr. McKeever.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.430
I, uh... I would like to disqualify
myself, uh, from responding.

29:26.306 --> 29:29.267
Uh, oh, I-I know
what you're thinking, that, uh...

29:29.350 --> 29:32.520
You're thinking,
"Why am I selling in the first place?"

29:32.604 --> 29:35.482
If you knew the sacrifice
that this represents, and...

29:35.565 --> 29:39.110
how I have anguished
over parting with Pegasus

29:39.194 --> 29:41.613
or whether I should hold onto her

29:42.030 --> 29:46.618
and, uh, try to finance<i> her</i>
and the sailboat both...

29:47.619 --> 29:52.457
Um, but, uh, t-to answer your question,
she's been a delight.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.877
Ooh, what if I took her for a test spin?
Would that be okay?

29:55.960 --> 29:56.961
Oh, of course.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.757
Uh, you wouldn't mind watching
our car for us, would you?

30:01.382 --> 30:02.884
The neighborhood. (chuckles)

30:05.303 --> 30:07.388
You, uh... You mean a solo drive?

30:09.641 --> 30:11.351
Oh, if you're worried, here.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.144
Take the keys.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.396
Oh. (laughs)

30:15.480 --> 30:16.815
Of course. Sure.

30:17.148 --> 30:17.982
Here we go!

30:19.776 --> 30:22.529
Hop up there.
Uh, I think she'll start right up.

30:22.612 --> 30:25.073
-Right.
-(engine starting)

30:44.092 --> 30:45.760
JOYCE: People ask 5,000 bail.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.847
We allege a pattern
of repeated robberies and assaults.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.849
Miss Brown has finally had enough.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.142
Domestic situation, Judge.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.854
Mr. Sanchez is here
from the Jefferson Job Action Corps

30:55.937 --> 30:57.272
to vouch for Mr. Jessup.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.607
Five thousand bail,

31:00.191 --> 31:01.651
10 percent cash.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.320
BAILIFF: You have to sign here.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.410
Miss Brown...

31:11.119 --> 31:12.495
I don't want to, Judge. Let him go.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.915
Ruby, come on. We're just one step away.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.709
Just tell him not to hit me no more, okay?

31:19.210 --> 31:23.131
I can do that, Miss Brown,
but, uh, I can't hold him unless you sign.

31:24.173 --> 31:27.176
Your Honor, Miss Brown is afraid
even though you've set bail today,

31:27.260 --> 31:29.554
that after a hearing,
that bail might be reduced.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.890
I can't help that. It's true.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.933
LOUIS: Judge, if I could just say...

31:34.434 --> 31:36.311
I'm gonna try real hard with Ruby,

31:36.394 --> 31:37.979
'cause I do care about the woman.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.815
So, if we had a problem,
it could be from my job situation,

31:40.899 --> 31:42.108
which is gonna change, Judge.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.359
I hope so...

31:44.110 --> 31:46.154
or I'll send you up the river
till Christmas.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.825
-Dismissed. Next case.
-(gavel bangs)

31:50.909 --> 31:51.784
FAY: Hold it!

31:52.619 --> 31:54.454
Please, Judge. Uh, Fay Furillo.

31:54.537 --> 31:55.914
I'll swear out the complaint.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.415
<i>You </i>will?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.709
Well, I saw the end of the attack.

31:59.792 --> 32:01.169
This is absurd.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.088
People will file
on new complainant's accusations.

32:04.505 --> 32:07.008
Judge, this is the most irregular
proceedings I've witnessed

32:07.091 --> 32:09.344
in my two years working these courts.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.054
If you accept this complaint,

32:11.137 --> 32:13.556
I demand an immediate hearing
on its adequacy.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.683
Miss DA?

32:17.143 --> 32:19.646
We've leapfrogged here
to your side's benefit.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.023
If the court requires a hearing
to hold Mr. Jessup,

32:22.106 --> 32:22.941
all right.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.362
With court stipulation as to court records
as entered, People rest.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.613
So stipulated.

32:28.696 --> 32:29.864
All right, let's go.

32:30.531 --> 32:34.786
Defense calls one witness only,
Officer Andrew Renko.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.580
Now what? What are you doing?

32:37.664 --> 32:39.582
If you won't stick up
for yourself, I will.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.461
BAILIFF: You swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

32:43.544 --> 32:44.379
I do.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.474
Officer Renko, is this a true copy
of your incident report,

32:56.557 --> 32:58.935
file number B7639,

32:59.018 --> 33:02.271
regarding the alleged assault
on Ruby Brown this morning?

33:02.355 --> 33:03.189
Yes, ma'am.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.899
Kindly read the last sentence.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.489
"Other witness, Fay Furillo,
says she saw no part of the crime."

33:12.949 --> 33:15.952
People withdraw the charges
without prejudice to reinstate.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.495
So ordered.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.124
Remember what I told you, Mr. Jessup.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.961
And you, Mrs. Furillo...

33:25.962 --> 33:28.256
<i>ix-nay </i>on the<i> ib-fays.</i>

33:29.841 --> 33:32.427
-(gavel bangs)
-JUDGE: Ten-minute recess.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.514
If Miss Brown changes her mind,
we'll start over.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.936
You are lucky I'm not asking
for a perjury count.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.522
It just wasn't meant to be, that's all.

33:44.605 --> 33:48.317
(sighs) Ruby, what about the shelter?
I can still take you there.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.280
So he can be waiting for me on the corner
when I walk out on the street?

33:52.864 --> 33:53.740
No way.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.325
I just want my welfare check, that's all.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.709
Uh...

34:06.002 --> 34:09.297
you know, I saw your bus
heading onto the expressway, man.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.425
Oh, no, that was with
a prospective buyer and his son.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.012
You mean you just let some guy
just drive off in your bus like that?

34:16.095 --> 34:17.513
No, no. It's a test-drive.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.141
Well, what makes you think
they're coming back?

34:20.224 --> 34:22.268
(laughs)

34:22.351 --> 34:24.520
Collateral. Collateral, my good man.

34:24.604 --> 34:27.356
(scoffs) Looks like a Ford to me.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.067
What's going on, Lieutenant?

34:30.276 --> 34:31.319
Is this your car?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.238
Now, where am I gonna get
a car like this, "Occifer"?

34:34.322 --> 34:37.492
Oh, it belongs to a fella
who's looking at the Pegasus.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.119
Yeah? Well, the report says
it was stolen this morning.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.037
It's hot.

34:42.121 --> 34:46.459
(laughing)

34:54.175 --> 34:55.802
Want a cup of coffee? Go ahead.

34:56.385 --> 34:58.888
I'm not gonna tell<i> you</i>
to have one, Mr. D. (laughs)

34:58.971 --> 35:00.223
(chuckles) Give him some coffee.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.851
MAN: By one shot,
everything's gonna be all right, Mr. D.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.020
Right now, they're in that basement.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.314
They're saying the equipment's good.

35:08.397 --> 35:10.066
The count is right on.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.235
Ring, they give me a call.

35:13.236 --> 35:18.991
"Stevie, give him the briefcase
with the one million dollars cash money."

35:20.243 --> 35:21.244
Now your biggest problem

35:21.327 --> 35:24.455
is how much sun do I get
my first day on the beach? (laughs)

35:25.456 --> 35:27.708
Hey, Mr. LiCalsi? Mr. LiCalsi?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.796
Gina, sweetheart, give me a shot.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.225
Stuff's on the truck and ready to go.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.018
Maybe you want to count it?

35:46.686 --> 35:49.689
-Freeze! Police!
-(indistinct shouting)

35:49.772 --> 35:52.483
Come on, Al. Cops all over the place.
Why don't you let her go?

35:52.984 --> 35:55.111
No good. I'll kill her. I swear it.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.070
Al, please.

35:56.154 --> 35:56.988
Shut up!

35:57.446 --> 35:58.656
We're gettin' out of here.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.450
All right. Kick that briefcase over to me.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.660
(Gina shuddering)

36:02.743 --> 36:03.578
Do it!

36:04.120 --> 36:04.954
All right.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.873
Okay, Al, take it easy. I'm coming.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.418
(briefcase clattering)

36:10.501 --> 36:12.920
-(Gina shuddering)
-All right, Gina, honey, pick it up.

36:13.671 --> 36:14.672
Pick it up!

36:15.464 --> 36:18.009
(squeals) Al! Al!

36:19.010 --> 36:20.261
-(door opens)
-MAN: Police! Freeze!

36:20.344 --> 36:21.262
-MAN 2: FBI!
-(woman screaming)

36:21.345 --> 36:23.472
-MAN: Police! Hold it!
-(guns fire)

36:23.931 --> 36:26.350
(people clamoring)

36:26.976 --> 36:28.644
MAN: You okay? Everything okay?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.855
I'm shot. I'm shot.

36:30.938 --> 36:33.191
Yeah, well, you're alive. You're alive.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.861
Gina? Gina, you okay?

36:36.944 --> 36:38.905
(Gina shuddering)

36:38.988 --> 36:40.448
You saved my life.

36:46.412 --> 36:49.582
STAN: What I can't figure out
is how you steal a motor home.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.126
I-It's like it just vanished.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.837
-What's going on?
-Oh, I've been victimized, Frank.

36:54.921 --> 36:58.132
Some guy stole Lieutenant Hunter's
nice motor home, captain.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.050
A pro.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.344
Same guy stole a station wagon
out of the ferry

37:01.427 --> 37:03.137
last night or-or this morning.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.388
-Insurance?
-Yes.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.599
Insurance don't cover sentiment.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.351
Well, it goes a long distance.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.895
Don't worry, Howard.
Maybe it will break down.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.689
How far can he get in a 29-foot lemon?

37:14.941 --> 37:17.235
Oh, Fay.
Listen, I heard what happened in court.

37:17.318 --> 37:20.196
Tomorrow. Can we talk about it
tomorrow, Frank, please?

37:20.988 --> 37:22.698
Captain. Captain.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.243
You made yourself
a lifetime friend at the Bureau.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.160
That's good to know.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.870
And I can take him off your hands
for you now.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.081
I'll take him down to federal detention,
do the processing.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.207
I'd like to hold him there.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.376
Well, as soon as we book him
on our murder.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.919
Oh. Absolutely.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.713
-Uh, Henry. Good work.
-Thanks.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.382
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.509
Listen, you wanna have dinner tonight?
My treat.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.302
Tomorrow, okay?

37:43.386 --> 37:46.222
Uh, Gina wants to take me out
for a little thank-you dinner.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.684
HARRY: Uh, hey, Gina.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.811
We can start calling you
an heiress again, huh?

37:51.894 --> 37:54.146
Yeah, I'm still a little shaky, Harry.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.107
Well, it definitely got scary there
at the end.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.567
You should've seen the way
Henry handled it.

37:58.651 --> 38:02.405
Yeah, I bet. Well, you know, police,
we face that kind of situation every day.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.448
He saved my life.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.449
My pleasure, Gina.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.411
So, Gina, what do you say we go out

38:08.494 --> 38:11.289
and have a nice,
quiet victory celebration?

38:12.206 --> 38:14.333
Uh, care to join us
for a drink, Lieutenant?

38:15.293 --> 38:19.630
Uh, I'm sorry, Harry.
Henry and I are going to the Red Lion.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.010
I see.

38:25.052 --> 38:26.846
-Well, in that--
-You wanna-- You wanna come join us?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.556
-Harry...
-No, no. That's okay.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.309
I, uh, really kind of feel like souvlaki.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.478
Well, I got a lot of things to do.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.024
Wa-- You wanna come sit down?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.650
-I'll just be a few minutes.
-Yeah. Okay.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.693
HENRY: Come over here.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.363
Gina!

38:44.697 --> 38:47.575
-(instruments clanging)
-Move, please!

38:47.658 --> 38:49.410
Wanna move? Move out of the way!

38:50.161 --> 38:52.496
Man with a tuba here! You wanna move?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.916
-Hold it right there, detective!
-(instruments clanging)

38:59.587 --> 39:00.880
Where'd this stuff come from?

39:01.922 --> 39:03.841
It's stolen property. I recovered it.

39:03.924 --> 39:05.092
Well, get it out of here.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.346
I already told you once,
I got no room to store this junk.

39:09.221 --> 39:12.099
(instruments clanging)

39:12.183 --> 39:13.017
Look...

39:13.809 --> 39:16.937
I've been thinking about this all day,
so I'm gonna say it right now.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.276
All the time I was living in that trailer,

39:23.319 --> 39:24.487
it was like I lost everything.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.530
My girl, my place, everything.

39:28.324 --> 39:32.703
You kind of took me under your wing.
You did. You gave me your friendship.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.332
I was, like, in the middle of this crisis,
and you pulled me through it.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.501
And now, Robin and me are back,

39:38.584 --> 39:40.878
and it's like I got my life
back together again,

39:40.961 --> 39:42.838
and all of a sudden, you're acting all...

39:43.172 --> 39:44.924
I don't know, weird!

39:46.550 --> 39:48.677
Hurt. Jealous.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.304
Jealous? Me?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.515
-Of what?
-I don't know.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.185
Robin.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.648
-(instruments clanging)
-Don't flatter yourself, detective.

40:01.357 --> 40:02.691
We talked about it.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.279
We were hoping you could come over
for dinner tomorrow.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.409
I don't think so.

40:15.037 --> 40:16.747
(instruments clanging)

40:16.831 --> 40:18.958
Oh, let's get this stuff out of the way,
at least. What do you say?

40:24.296 --> 40:25.131
(sniffs)

40:25.214 --> 40:27.216
(instruments clanging)

40:36.809 --> 40:38.769
Okay, here's your stuff.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.146
W-What can I say?

40:40.855 --> 40:41.689
Nothing.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.734
I've been thinking about what you said.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.321
We both could bend a little bit, okay?

40:50.239 --> 40:53.075
Now, there are subway entrances
off the hill.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.704
Detective, I am deeply indebted
to you for this,

40:56.787 --> 40:58.247
and I intend to repay you.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.331
All right.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.585
Stay out of trouble
and do yourself a favor...

41:03.210 --> 41:05.629
go a little easy on the cymbals.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.755
Right.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.799
-Right. Got it.
-(telephone clatters)

41:08.883 --> 41:10.176
-LaRue, Washington.
-J.D.: Yeah?

41:10.259 --> 41:13.220
We got a stabbing homicide,
1049 Jefferson.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.056
-What was that address?
-1049 Jefferson.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.434
Uh, a Brown? A Ruby Brown?

41:18.517 --> 41:19.977
Victim? Uh-uh.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.687
Victim, Louis Jessup.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.230
But we got a woman suspect.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.608
That-That's my client.
That's my situation.

41:25.691 --> 41:28.235
Come with us, Mrs. Furillo.
Maybe<i> you've </i>got some info for us.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.696
(groans) Damn! Wait, let me get my coat!

41:34.116 --> 41:39.413
-(baby crying)
-(siren wailing)

41:39.497 --> 41:40.748
RUBY: He got so drunk.

41:41.373 --> 41:45.044
Like, he gets saying he was gonna kill me
and the babies both

41:45.377 --> 41:47.046
on account of his humiliation.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.174
I run out in the hallway to escape,

41:51.008 --> 41:52.510
but he caught me out there.

41:53.677 --> 41:57.181
And when he fell, I took the knife
away from him, and I cut him.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.934
But I sure didn't mean to kill the man.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.061
Ruby, we got three witnesses
down the hall.

42:02.144 --> 42:04.313
I can't promise, but I think
you're gonna be okay on this

42:04.396 --> 42:05.981
on grounds of self-defense.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.525
-We ready?
-Yeah, go on.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.193
What about my babies?
Where they gonna be?

42:09.276 --> 42:10.945
FAY: Ruby, Ruby,
they're with the Youth Authority.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.154
They're gonna be fine.

42:16.158 --> 42:17.993
Nice timing, Miss Chapman.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.746
I don't need any
of your hindsight sarcasm, okay?

42:22.957 --> 42:26.085
-What are you doing here, anyway?
-Just lay off, okay? I screwed up!

42:26.168 --> 42:28.671
-Isn't that good enough for you?
-No.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.130
It's not.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.425
FRANK: Standard hospital guard,
hospital arraignment afterwards.

42:33.509 --> 42:34.635
Release on recognizance.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.762
If you have any problem,
call me personally.

42:39.306 --> 42:41.308
-Frank, can we talk?
-Sure.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.022
It was as if we...

42:47.731 --> 42:51.569
We both had
these big self-fulfilling prophecies.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.573
It's her life, Fay, not yours.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.450
I know, but I feel so horrible.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.828
Like, if I hadn't been
such a naive jerk...

43:01.203 --> 43:03.205
I don't think you were a naive jerk.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.792
I wanted to give her hope.

43:07.543 --> 43:10.004
I wanted her to see
that the system could work for her.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.339
Fay...

43:14.508 --> 43:15.342
What?

43:18.887 --> 43:22.683
I think you've had a taste of the despair
that comes with the territory up here.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.272
It's where the job starts.

43:28.897 --> 43:30.983
-(sniffles)
-It doesn't have to be where it ends.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.034
You know, it's so funny.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.246
Five years ago, I would've hated you.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.791
And today, you saved my life.

43:50.127 --> 43:53.505
I feel like a
completely different person now.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.843
So, what do you... (clears throat)

43:58.344 --> 43:59.928
What do you think you're gonna do now?

44:00.346 --> 44:01.597
What do you mean?

44:02.181 --> 44:03.641
(laughs)

44:03.724 --> 44:05.893
I mean, now that you're on your own.

44:06.518 --> 44:11.357
Oh, well, first I've gotta pry loose
the rest of Paul's estate.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.734
Then I have to diversify everything.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.195
Paul put everything in property and cars.

44:16.278 --> 44:18.781
And I wanna sit down
with a qualified money manager

44:18.864 --> 44:20.449
and figure it all out.

44:20.532 --> 44:23.744
You know, how much
to set aside in tax-frees,

44:23.827 --> 44:27.039
how much to maintain in cash
and cash equivalent.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.461
I like that I can talk to you.

44:34.046 --> 44:39.093
I feel like
I can really open up to you.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.681
I really want to get to know you better.

44:46.725 --> 44:48.185
I thought you were seeing Harry.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.939
(sighs) N-- I like Harry.

44:52.564 --> 44:55.150
Harry's... Harry's a good friend.

44:57.403 --> 44:58.237
I thought...

45:00.656 --> 45:01.490
I didn't know.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.160
I've only known you for today, Henry...

45:06.245 --> 45:08.330
but I feel so good around you.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.083
I'm very...

45:12.167 --> 45:13.836
attracted to you.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.506
My heart is pounding.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.721
My heart is pounding, too.

45:25.013 --> 45:25.973
(sighs)

45:27.683 --> 45:30.018
Maybe I'm not really your type at all.

45:31.103 --> 45:32.938
You don't think I'm... (inhales)

45:33.439 --> 45:36.400
I'm bad, or evil, or something?

45:36.483 --> 45:37.818
God, no!

45:40.404 --> 45:41.530
I think you're great.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.115
You do?

45:45.993 --> 45:46.869
Henry?

45:47.911 --> 45:51.707
Would it be okay if we just got the check?

45:53.417 --> 45:55.627
I don't really feel like eating.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.588
-What?
-Well...

45:59.757 --> 46:00.591
Oh, sure.

46:00.883 --> 46:04.553
Did you notice there's a hotel
across the street?

46:06.263 --> 46:07.848
(sighs)

46:08.474 --> 46:10.976
(both chuckling)

46:19.902 --> 46:21.612
Where's your toothbrush and stuff?

46:23.572 --> 46:24.990
It's in my shaving kit.

46:26.617 --> 46:27.910
And where's your shaving kit?

46:29.703 --> 46:32.790
(chuckles) Right here. Why?

46:33.999 --> 46:35.667
Mick, you're living here now.

46:36.877 --> 46:37.711
I know.

46:39.046 --> 46:42.216
(chuckles) That means you get to put
your stuff in the bathroom.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.927
-(chuckles)
-That means this is your place now.

46:45.677 --> 46:46.512
All right.

46:47.679 --> 46:48.514
(sighs)

47:05.197 --> 47:09.034
(objects clattering)

47:13.372 --> 47:16.458
-(exhales)
-(marching band music playing)

47:44.987 --> 47:45.946
How do you feel?

47:47.865 --> 47:48.740
Pretty good.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.328
I'm a little scared.

47:53.412 --> 47:55.414
(band music continues)

48:03.046 --> 48:05.048
(closing theme playing)
