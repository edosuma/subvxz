19:18.960 --> 19:20.560
Your father owned most things.

19:21.530 --> 19:22.923
He invested in legit business.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.040
He was distancing himself
away from all the dirty stuff.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.858
He gave the Regittis the
job of running the clubs

19:31.860 --> 19:33.113
and a few territories.

19:34.360 --> 19:39.360
They always had grudges
against the local groups.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.683
Also, your father had a shipping business.

19:42.584 --> 19:43.634
He imported firearms.

So suppose we can trust anyone of them?

they work for your father

19:55.100 --> 19:56.903

20:16.270 --> 20:17.103
Yes.

20:19.310 --> 20:21.360
Your father used him to tie loose ends.

20:26.816 --> 20:27.766

Anyway, when do you want

57:11.590 --> 57:14.003
to set up a meeting with little Vukovic?

57:14.860 --> 57:16.060
The sooner the better.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.788
With his father's connections,

57:18.790 --> 57:21.038
we'll finally get these shipments moving.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.538
We accomplish that and within a year,

57:23.540 --> 57:25.548
we own this city.

57:25.550 --> 57:26.700
I like your thinking.

57:28.137 --> 57:30.628
You think the Black Ghost
would have anymore leads?

57:30.630 --> 57:31.500
I don't know.

57:32.775 --> 57:34.913
Lushas is a dead end.

57:36.440 --> 57:38.123
Who supplies the north side gang?

57:40.183 --> 57:41.294
Roddicker.

57:41.296 --> 57:42.713

Moshes, we have a problem.

58:05.820 --> 58:07.638
The guy my sister hired,
he's really digging

58:07.640 --> 58:09.418
his teeth into this.

58:09.420 --> 58:10.878
He's checked out Lushas territory

58:10.880 --> 58:12.398
and guess where he's going next.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.897
Whoa, slow down boy.

58:13.899 --> 58:15.298
What's the problem?

58:15.300 --> 58:17.675
Who is this guy?

58:17.677 --> 58:19.448
Are you serious?

58:19.450 --> 58:20.618
The Black Ghost.

58:20.620 --> 58:23.468
You know, ex military,
dresses like a hobo.

58:23.470 --> 58:25.328
Really good with guns,
even better with knives

58:25.330 --> 58:27.038
and would kick your ass
if he was in the same room

58:27.040 --> 58:28.438
like you.

58:28.440 --> 58:30.308
My sister hired him to find the people

58:30.310 --> 58:32.197
who killed our parents.

58:32.199 --> 58:34.198
He's one sick motherfucker

58:34.200 --> 58:35.298
and he's getting a bit too close

58:35.300 --> 58:36.778
for my liking.

58:36.780 --> 58:39.548
His next place he's
checking is Roddicker's.

58:39.550 --> 58:41.972
Shit, I knew you sister investigated

58:41.974 --> 58:46.168
I just didn't expect her to
get this Black Ghost guy.

58:46.170 --> 58:49.768
Look, I'll talk to her,
okay, I'll sort it out.

58:49.770 --> 58:51.408
No, do nothing.

58:51.410 --> 58:52.510
We'll take care of it.

59:01.880 --> 59:03.588
Our rat Robert has just found out

59:03.590 --> 59:07.478
that his sister has hired the Black Ghost.

59:07.480 --> 59:10.168
She's gonna fuck it all up for us.

59:10.170 --> 59:12.198
I'll take care of this Black Ghost.

59:12.200 --> 59:15.658
No, I want you to take
care of this sister.

59:15.660 --> 59:17.711
What about the Black Ghost?

59:17.713 --> 59:21.508
I'll get Bulldog to take care of him.

59:21.510 --> 59:23.170
Its about time he earned his keep

59:25.259 --> 59:27.213

59:28.550 --> 59:30.148

the Black Ghost did it.

01:00:04.204 --> 01:00:06.543
He used to work for Vukovic.

01:00:07.968 --> 01:00:10.801
