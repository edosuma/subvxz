WEBVTT

00:28.235 --> 00:31.530
IRMA VEP

02:54.298 --> 02:58.010
Sorry. Am I disturbing you?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.767
I like to spend time on set
before the crew comes

03:03.849 --> 03:06.019
and turns it into chaos.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.938
So do I.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.983
I have to absorb how it
feels as a real place.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.782
I need to make sure it's haunted.

03:21.700 --> 03:26.080
Sorry, I feel safer
if you're not pointing a gun at me.

03:28.415 --> 03:30.084
Am I that dangerous?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.796
You are Irma Vep for me,
so, yes, you are dangerous.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.133
Yeah, but off camera,
I am a nice person.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.927
No, not to me.
Maybe later...

03:40.887 --> 03:42.304
when the shoot is over.

03:43.724 --> 03:48.895
- Is it haunted enough for you?
- The set?

03:50.062 --> 03:55.359
Well, most of the time,
sets are soulless.

03:56.778 --> 04:01.575
- But not this one.
- You have an actual ghost with a gun.

04:02.700 --> 04:07.539
Mira do you believe
in the invisible?

04:08.080 --> 04:13.878
The invisible.
I guess so.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.798
I mean, it depends on
what you call invisible.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.969
Things that exist,
but you cannot see.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
- Like what?
- Like...

04:30.687 --> 04:32.229
Wi-Fi.

04:32.688 --> 04:34.816
- Wi-Fi...
- Yeah, Wi-Fi, yeah.

04:35.733 --> 04:42.072
Yeah. But then sometimes

04:42.406 --> 04:44.910
I feel like
it's not there and it's not working.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.370
What about presences?

04:47.829 --> 04:50.873
You mean the way a place
has some sort of soul?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.291
Or not.

04:52.374 --> 04:54.753
That you can't see
but you can feel.

04:55.753 --> 04:57.798
- Yes, yes.
- I do.

04:58.631 --> 05:04.553
Sets are eerie because they're real
and they're not real.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.308
They look real, but they're
an imitation of reality...

05:09.810 --> 05:13.188
just like dreams
are an imitation of reality.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.857
You're right, like dreams.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.863
- Were you rehearsing?
- I was.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.118
Do you want to show me?

05:27.577 --> 05:29.954
Are you sure I should
kill the Grand Vampire?

05:30.037 --> 05:32.082
Oh yes.
We should get rid of him.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.917
He's definitely not
gonna be happy.

05:37.127 --> 05:38.547
Screw him.

05:40.256 --> 05:45.678
I'm here for you,
so I'm in for the ride.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.851
The Grand Vampire visits Moreno
to pay Irma Vep's ransom

06:03.613 --> 06:05.991
"Irma doesn't wish to leave me.
Ask her yourself,"

06:06.073 --> 06:07.659
"she's in the next room."

06:17.751 --> 06:19.212
Still under Moreno's spell,

06:19.295 --> 06:21.423
Irma Vep shoots
to kill the Grand Vampire!

06:26.177 --> 06:28.304
Yes! Great!
Yeah, you did it!

06:28.762 --> 06:32.434
Now shoot him again.
Empty the barrel.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.353
Now, jump on him.

06:35.853 --> 06:39.149
Yeah, with both feet.
Jump on him!

06:39.231 --> 06:42.152
René, I have heels on.
I can't jump on him.

06:42.652 --> 06:46.823
No. He's dead. He doesn't feel nothing.
Jump on him.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.035
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay, it's fine.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.829
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.539
This is between René and me!

06:55.873 --> 06:57.416
He"s a nutcase!

06:57.499 --> 06:59.419
René, I will sue
the hell out of you!

07:00.128 --> 07:02.713
It's payback time!
You're going down!

07:04.549 --> 07:05.592
Fuck you.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.177
You're dead!
The Grand Vampire is dead!

07:08.678 --> 07:10.680
- Damn right, he's dead!
- Thank you.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.598
He's out of the story! Bye-bye!

07:13.265 --> 07:16.561
I'll see you in arbitration
motherfucker!

07:16.643 --> 07:21.357
Go fuck yourself, scumbag!
Go fuck yourself! Dammit!

07:26.111 --> 07:30.158
I'm done with this Him! Shit!

07:32.702 --> 07:35.621
Get him out of here!

07:35.705 --> 07:40.501
I can't stand him anymore!
I hate Robert! Shit!

07:42.002 --> 07:43.754
Here we go.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.219
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Daddy.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.096
- Are they tucked in?
- Yes.

07:57.184 --> 07:59.853
I'm seriously worried.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.649
You are always seriously
worried.

08:04.526 --> 08:08.822
That's part of working with René,
You can't let him do that.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.448
I try. This time, he's gone too far.

08:12.366 --> 08:16.496
He completely lost his shit today,
and Robert is no longer in the show.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.462
- How long have you worked with René?
- 15 years.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.842
Don't you think you need a break?

08:31.927 --> 08:35.140
- I have to protect him.
- From what?

08:35.514 --> 08:40.103
- Himself. He's gone missing.
- Meaning?

08:41.645 --> 08:46.818
I even called his wife. No news.
He's not returning my calls.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.903
I have no idea if we're
shooting tomorrow.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.239
That's an insurance issue.

08:52.322 --> 08:56.618
I'm not sure we're covered
for the director vanishing.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.373
Knock on wood.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.585
That's the
best you can come up with?

09:03.667 --> 09:05.462
Do you want me to sugarcoat it?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.143
Fuck!

09:24.439 --> 09:26.899
- Hello?
- Sorry for disturbing you at this hour.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.984
- We have a small problem.
- Is it René?

09:29.485 --> 09:30.944
No. it's not René.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.863
- What now?
- It's Gottfried.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.618
Jesus! I knew from day one
that he was trouble.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.161
How can I put this?

09:38.243 --> 09:41.622
He hung himself
in some sort of sex game.

09:41.705 --> 09:43.333
What? Is he...

09:43.415 --> 09:47.003
We're not sure
if he's completely alive.

09:47.711 --> 09:49.464
I can't get a straight answer.

09:49.546 --> 09:51.131
- From who?
- The paramedics.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.759
I'm at the hotel now.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.386
I'm going to ask
for their medical report.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.305
Here comes a doctor.
I'll call you back!

09:57.387 --> 10:00.140
Excuse me sir, any news?

10:00.558 --> 10:04.394
He's alive, but he may have
brain damage.

10:04.479 --> 10:08.607
He might make it, but his memory
or mobility may be compromised.

10:09.107 --> 10:13.488
Sorry, can I ask a stupid question?
It's part of my job.

10:14.531 --> 10:19.034
Is there any chance
he can shoot tomorrow?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.037
He'll be lucky if he's alive tomorrow.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.415
Okay...

10:25.499 --> 10:30.255
Excuse us. Coming through, thanks.
I'D ride with the patient.

10:30.337 --> 10:34.800
They're waiting for us there.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.471
Perfect. Ready, lift. I'm lifting.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.065
Hello?
They finally left for the hospital.

10:49.147 --> 10:51.943
I'm jumping on my scooter
to follow them.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.904
I can't tell you more than
what the doctor just said.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.450
- Gautier's calling.
- You called him?

10:59.533 --> 11:03.453
- Of course. I had to.
- I don't envy you. Good luck.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.956
Call me as soon
as they've scanned him.

11:06.039 --> 11:07.709
I'll keep you posted.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.590
- Thanks for calling back.
- Just got your message.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.384
- You sounded very concerned.
- Yes. We have kind of an issue.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.179
Concerning Mira?

11:19.262 --> 11:24.558
No. The problem is
with the German actor. Gottfried.

11:25.225 --> 11:27.604
Gottfried?
I frankly don't remember him.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.771
You scared me for a moment.

11:31.481 --> 11:34.152
What's goina on
with this German actor?

11:35.235 --> 11:39.281
It's a sensitive situation.
He's been hospitalized.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.828
- Poor guy. An accident?
- Yes, sort of...

11:43.912 --> 11:45.162
Did it happen on set?

11:45.246 --> 11:48.290
No, in his hotel room.
He was found in the closet.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.626
What do you mean?

11:51.085 --> 11:54.421
As you may know,
when a man is hanged...

11:54.756 --> 12:00.887
he has a spontaneous,
automatic erection.

12:03.513 --> 12:06.226
Well no, I didn't know that.

12:06.308 --> 12:10.104
Some people use a noose
or a belt to hang themselves

12:10.187 --> 12:15.485
from a closet rod for the purpose
of sexual arousal.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.278
"Autoerotic asohvxiation."

12:18.363 --> 12:21.657
"Autoerotic asphyxiation?"
He sounds insane...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.242
Why wasn't he kept
on a tighter leash?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.829
He had a PA who was
attached to him at the hip.

12:27.245 --> 12:30.959
But apparently Gottfried insisted
on going to a "bear bar,"

12:31.876 --> 12:35.629
which is the kind of place you
go to cruise older, heavy, gay men.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.550
I've never been
to a place like that.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.679
But it seems people like it.

12:44.179 --> 12:45.807
When did this happen?

12:45.889 --> 12:48.392
We dont know. He wasn't
answering his phone.

12:48.476 --> 12:52.145
Carta had the door busted open,
and they found him in the closet.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.273
- Alive?
- Technically speaking, yes.

12:55.358 --> 12:59.820
- But unconscious.
- Are you saying he's braindead?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.156
No, but the prognosis is not good.

13:03.449 --> 13:07.953
Get in touch with our lawyer.
I'll email you his contact info.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.624
- I'll do it first thing in the morning.
- No, right now.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.252
- Very good.
- Not a word to anyone.

13:15.335 --> 13:19.340
You'll let him handle communication
with his agent, family, etc...

13:20.758 --> 13:25.305
We're doing damage control now.
What are his chances of survival?

13:26.179 --> 13:27.390
Poor.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.561
It's a very unusual case.
But we do see them once in a while.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.064
Usually on weekends.
Saturday nights.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.609
You know... the family
is away, they get bored.

13:40.028 --> 13:44.281
How pathetic. What are
Gottfried's odds, 50/50?

13:45.449 --> 13:48.786
Sometimes they come back,
sometimes they dont.

13:50.121 --> 13:54.458
- In this case, I'd say 30/70.
- 30/70?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.461
Maybe 25/75...

13:57.795 --> 14:01.549
Have you reached René?
Keep trying him.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.887
I'm coming to the production office.
We cant shoot today.

14:07.763 --> 14:13.351
Do not call Mirai Gautier's lawyers
are contacting her agent.

14:14.561 --> 14:17.440
I'm iust oraving he'll resurface
before Gautier ever finds out.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.151
Angus, obviously we're not
shooting today,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.904
but we know we can switch
these 2 weeks on our schedule,

14:23.988 --> 14:25.739
and start shooting on Saturdays.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.325
On Fridays, Edmond Lagrange
is doing a play.

14:28.409 --> 14:32.872
He's playing Les Fourberies
de Scapinin St. Etienne.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.541
It's great for him.
Will the crew work on Saturdays?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.001
We'll figure something out.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.171
- A cofffee?
- Thank vou.

14:43.174 --> 14:46.677
When were you going
to tell me that René's gone?

14:46.761 --> 14:50.138
This just happened yesterday
after the blow up with Robert.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.684
- He left set and didn't come back.
- Called him. Nothing new.

14:56.269 --> 14:58.563
We have to consider replacing him.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.568
Does he even know
Gottfried attempted suicide?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.444
Technically, it wasn't suicide.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.864
It was more like a...
sex game.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.950
Let's not speak about the sex game
because it's not sure.

15:10.033 --> 15:13.829
We don't know.
The doctor has to let us know still.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.041
Let's give him a bit more time.
I think he's going to resurface.

15:17.457 --> 15:20.920
- Let's call his agent.
- His agent isn't helpful.

15:23.588 --> 15:26.300
To hide this... What a mess!

15:28.136 --> 15:31.639
- Hi Angus, you good?
- To be honest, no.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.267
Gautier will be furious
to hear about René.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.602
- I hear you.
- You're on speaker.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.603
- Hello.
- Hello, Vladimir.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.357
- Have you heard from him?
- No. I made the rounds. Nothing yet.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.817
What should we do?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.947
Be patient.
It's been less than 24 hours.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.783
We've already been very patient
with your client.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.827
You can't shoot
with an actor in the ICU.

15:53.911 --> 15:58.207
We can shuffle the schedule.
You know how it works.

15:58.915 --> 16:01.918
Gautier's so sick of René's bullshit.

16:02.335 --> 16:05.673
René doesn't matter...

16:05.756 --> 16:08.174
I'm sorry but he fired Robert Danjou,

16:08.259 --> 16:12.430
a man who is a fine actor and
gentleman.

16:12.512 --> 16:15.473
He's humiliated him.
We may have a lawsuit on ourhands l

16:16.225 --> 16:19.144
That's filmmaking. Shit happens!

16:19.854 --> 16:21.897
No, this is chaos.
This is the last straw.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.690
We won't tolerate it anymore.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.735
Who knows, René may have had an
accident.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.780
We're getting nowhere. If he doesn't
surface by soon, he's fired.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.324
- If he calls you, tell him that.
- Got it.

16:32.407 --> 16:35.535
- See ya.
- Bye.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.830
- He's useless.
- That's an understatement!

16:38.915 --> 16:40.958
Luckily, I've been working on plan B.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.126
What's plan B?

16:42.208 --> 16:44.294
I was in touch
with Herman Ray's agent.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.381
Herman? the Herman from
Doomsday?

16:47.465 --> 16:50.175
It'll iust require a little finessing.

16:50.258 --> 16:53.053
I'm really not sure Herman
is the right fit.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.806
This show is very European,
it's not his style.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.145
It's his experience,
people know this...

17:01.687 --> 17:03.940
Doomsday has nothing to do
with The Vampires.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.566
They're polar opposites.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.986
- No? Is it just me?
- I've already zoomed with his people.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.155
They'd seriouslv consider an offer.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.032
Stop!

18:58.470 --> 19:02.307
- My god.
- Hi. Are you okay?

19:03.099 --> 19:05.727
- Yeah. I"m totally fine.
- You sure?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.020
How good to see you.

19:08.396 --> 19:10.358
Yes. In the hotel.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.027
I was, coming out of the elevator
and I saw him right there.

19:14.652 --> 19:16.072
And he passed out.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.740
No, he's fine.
He's in the shower.

19:18.823 --> 19:21.452
I put him in a cold shower.
I think he"s fine right now.

19:21.868 --> 19:23.871
He didn't seem any
less coherent than usual.

19:23.953 --> 19:25.998
He just wanted
to go straight to set.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.124
And I was like,
"No, you need to rest."

19:29.085 --> 19:30.836
Yeah. No, it's fine.

19:31.544 --> 19:34.006
I think he's done with the shower.
I"ll call you back?

19:36.299 --> 19:37.927
What the fuck happened to you?

19:38.635 --> 19:40.095
I don't know.

19:40.178 --> 19:42.098
I was quietly sitting
in my hotel room

19:43.223 --> 19:46.268
reading this really cool book
about drugs in Nazi Germany.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.186
"Blitzed."
Heard of it?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.481
- Never.
- It's fascinating.

19:50.563 --> 19:53.109
Did you know all those
elite troops were on speed?

19:54.402 --> 19:57.446
- Okay.
- Then there was a blank.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.158
I woke up in a clinic...
drips in my arms.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.744
Well, let me fill you in.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.164
Seems you hung yourself
in the closet and passed out.

20:07.789 --> 20:11.167
Now I understand the neck pain
and the strangulation...

20:11.252 --> 20:13.129
- I guess so.
- Strangulation mark.

20:13.211 --> 20:15.172
- I was wondering.
- Please, eat something.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.423
Yeah, nothing to worry about.

20:17.508 --> 20:19.635
Something I do if
I can"t get my dick up.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.304
Does it work?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.598
Usually, it works,
but sometimes I black out.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.935
- It's a thin line.
- Seems this one was close.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.355
- I've done much worse.
- I"m sure.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.693
But now I feel fit as fuck.
It just boosts you.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.239
You have no idea.

20:40.321 --> 20:42.825
Seems the brain scan
showed no lesion, so...

20:50.790 --> 20:52.625
Yeah, I think it's
an excellent offer.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.545
I need to discuss it
again with Laurie.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.765
Me and my team, we had
a second Zoom with the French.

21:07.515 --> 21:09.851
And they seriously want
me to finish "Irma Vep."

21:10.351 --> 21:12.395
- You're really considering it?
- Yeah.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.565
I mean, I ain't give 'em
my decision yet.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.193
I told 'em to wait
till tomorrow.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.444
But Marvel pushed
back "Sharkman," and...

21:20.195 --> 21:22.531
thought you"d be happy to go
to Paris for a few weeks.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.407
- I am.
- And the money's good.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.453
I'm sorry to be blunt,
but it"s basically a hack job.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.289
What you talkin' 'bout?
I mean, it"s a prestige gig.

21:30.371 --> 21:32.625
Honey, you shouldn't be
doing a TV show right now.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.752
- It's bad for your image.
- How?

21:34.834 --> 21:39.089
"Doomsday" performed well,
so you can build on the momentum.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.467
This "Irma Vep" thing's
gonna take you nowhere.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.010
So you don't wanna go to Paris?

21:44.094 --> 21:47.096
Of course, I wanna go to Paris.
Who doesn't wanna go to Paris?

21:48.265 --> 21:49.724
But I care about you.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.478
I'm concerned about
you and Mira, though.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.939
- No reason to be.
- I sense there's no closure.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.484
I don"t know about her, but...

21:59.485 --> 22:01.903
I'm perfectly fine with being
just friends with her.

22:03.988 --> 22:05.823
At a distance... of course.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.451
If we do go, we'll make sure
there's distance.

22:08.534 --> 22:11.163
Thank you. What the fuck happened
with René Vidal?

22:11.247 --> 22:13.164
Apparently,
that motherfucker vanished.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.084
- Really?
- Yeah. Cut his phone off.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.169
- Nobody can contact him.
- You tried?

22:17.253 --> 22:19.379
- I sent him a text.
- Did he text you back?

22:20.089 --> 22:23.132
Kinda.
He never seen no GIF like this.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.638
See, I interpret it
as him sayin', "Be my guest."

22:29.555 --> 22:34.269
It strikes me for something a little
less nuanced, like, "Go fuck yourself."

22:37.565 --> 22:40.316
Have you tried René again?
Turned his cell off.

22:41.859 --> 22:44.404
I sent him a couple texts.
I"m not surprised.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.824
Just disappointed.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.867
I committed to this show
because of René.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.497
I could feel betrayed.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.665
- I'm sure he's in pain.
- I know.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.376
But now we're stuck with Herman.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.085
They need your approval.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.005
You know I'm going
to give my approval.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.798
There aren't many
options anyway.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.969
- At least he"s the evil I know.
- Herman is not evil.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.767
- I'm scared though.
- Why?

23:15.102 --> 23:17.688
- I miss Laurie.
- I don't.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.898
I called her this morning.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.402
- She didn't pick up.
- Why the fuck did you call her?

23:23.818 --> 23:25.195
She'll be in town.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.157
We might as well set the rules.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.533
Laurie doesn't play by any rule.

23:32.118 --> 23:34.371
Don't let her hurt you
more than she already has.

23:43.421 --> 23:44.630
- Hello.
- Come in.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.518
So?

23:57.353 --> 23:59.520
I haven't been
home since yesterday morning.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.900
- I wandered through Paris all night.
- Have vou contacted your wife?

24:03.983 --> 24:05.234
No, no, actually...

24:05.318 --> 24:09.947
When I'm shooting, my wife goes
out of town. She takes the kids.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.201
They usually
stay with her mother.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.830
According to her,
I'm unbearable when I shoot.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.042
Are you?

24:20.124 --> 24:26.923
I cant say I disagree with her.
I made a terrible mistake.

24:28.050 --> 24:33.471
I shouldn't be doing this series.
I'm going to back out.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.766
I thought you carefully thought
this through?

24:36.849 --> 24:39.894
- Not thoroughly enough.
- It could be therapeutic.

24:40.770 --> 24:43.983
- It hasn't been.
- Why do you say that?

24:44.607 --> 24:51.406
A few days ago I received
a visit from Jade's ghost.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.533
- Her ghost?
- Yes.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.246
- Is she dead?
- No. She's alive. But she was there.

24:58.121 --> 25:03.794
Excuse me. Yes?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.922
Could you put the envelope
under the doormat?

25:07.547 --> 25:10.509
Thanks. Sorry.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.056
So, ten years later,
she's still haunting you.

25:16.139 --> 25:19.184
- Twelve years!
- Sorry. Twelve.

25:19.727 --> 25:24.772
I believed that making this long,
eight-hour film,

25:24.857 --> 25:27.650
would bring some sort of closure.

25:28.485 --> 25:32.864
But I haven't found closure.
I'm just opening up old wounds.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.242
You've said Mira embodies
the possibility of a new beginning.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.077
That's true. Yes.

25:40.413 --> 25:45.918
- Do you love her?
- Yes. I love her. Of course I do.

25:46.003 --> 25:50.924
She's a kindred spirit.
But it's something else.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.343
No less valuable than
what I had with Jade.

25:53.844 --> 25:58.431
- And she's not a ghost.
- No. She's so alive, so full of life.

25:59.390 --> 26:05.897
But you know ghosts have very little to
do with the dead.

26:06.899 --> 26:11.694
They're more
about what's dead inside us.

26:13.655 --> 26:17.576
More about the
past that lives inside us.

26:19.912 --> 26:23.998
All that is foreian to Mira.
She's the cure.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.542
- She cures you?
- Yes.

26:26.627 --> 26:32.216
But I also want to protect her
from my disease.

26:34.133 --> 26:36.719
- Your disease?
- Yes, yester...

26:38.554 --> 26:39.723
Sorry.

26:41.225 --> 26:47.146
I had a happening yesterday.

26:48.147 --> 26:50.066
- What happened?
- It was that actor.

26:51.526 --> 26:54.113
I wish I'd killed him.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.823
You've struggled
with these homicidal impulses,

26:57.908 --> 26:59.450
mostly when you're on set.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.495
You've made great progress
over the past few years.

27:02.828 --> 27:07.835
They came back. With a vengeance,
after being kept at bay.

27:08.292 --> 27:12.798
Why do you think you couldn't
control your anger yesterday?

27:13.756 --> 27:16.133
- Is there a reason?
- Yes...

27:17.511 --> 27:19.346
Can you share it?

27:19.428 --> 27:24.226
That actor took umbrage
with an abduction scene,

27:24.309 --> 27:28.104
one that is iconic in
Feuillade's original show.

27:29.565 --> 27:34.653
And he called
this abduction scene a rape.

27:35.069 --> 27:38.907
Abduction means taking someone
against their will.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.118
In that sense, there's a link to rape.

27:42.201 --> 27:44.580
Are you saying the actor was right?

27:45.580 --> 27:49.293
I'm not calling you a rapist.
I think you're anything but...

27:49.917 --> 27:51.628
I'm iust explaining the mechanics.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.255
I hate him.

27:53.337 --> 27:56.300
He's blocking you from doing
what you desire.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.509
- My desire?
- Your cinematic fantasies.

28:21.867 --> 28:25.871
Remind me who this Herman person we
just hired is?

28:25.953 --> 28:28.539
A big director. He just did Doomsday
with Mira.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.709
Right, that film where
Ragnar gets his balls cut off!

28:31.793 --> 28:33.002
That's the one.

28:35.338 --> 28:39.676
My wife told me she liked K a lot.
But they're killing the franchise.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.053
How can there be another Doomsday
without Ragnar?

28:42.136 --> 28:45.682
No, is a smart move.
Ragnar comes back as transgender.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.934
The first trans superhero.
A visionary proiect.

28:49.435 --> 28:51.855
What does Mira think about Herman?

28:52.356 --> 28:55.025
To be honest she wasn't too thrilled.
But what can we do?

28:55.107 --> 28:56.692
René's missing. She understands.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.904
They did Doomsday together.
They're close.

28:59.278 --> 29:04.451
This is all good news. Have you
discussed Herman with the insurers?

29:04.533 --> 29:08.120
The insurers are willing to help as long
as we vacate the lot as planned.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.539
Too expensive to keep it.

29:09.623 --> 29:13.043
That'll be impossible. Herman doesn't
land until Monday morning.

29:13.125 --> 29:16.253
He'll drop his bags at the Plaza Athénée,
do some location scouting.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.965
He'll be ready to shoot on Tuesday.

29:18.047 --> 29:21.843
The insurers need us to shoot tomorrow,
dismantle the set, and vacate the lot.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.260
So, we need a director.

29:23.637 --> 29:27.849
When I spoke to Mira, she suggested
her assistant, Regina, could direct.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.643
She insists she can do it.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.854
- Good.
- Regina is straight out of filmschool.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.940
I've seen her shorts.
She's talented.

29:35.856 --> 29:40.112
We could do worse than her.
She's developing a feature.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.447
I might even
be interested in buying it.

29:42.530 --> 29:46.660
Give the kid a break, make Mira happy.
Then Herbert takes over.

29:47.034 --> 29:48.536
- Herman!
- What?

29:48.619 --> 29:51.248
- His name is Herman.
. Herman!

29:53.375 --> 29:54.875
I'm in a complete panic.

29:55.334 --> 29:58.003
They want me to replace
René just to save the day.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.549
Sounds like a great
opportunity to me. Grab it.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.469
But I'm not prepared,
and it's not even my project.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.347
- Make it your project.
- For a day?

30:08.724 --> 30:10.182
Mira needs your help.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.644
I'm the one who needs
all the help I can get.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.564
Oh, come on. You'll be fine.
It's only one scene.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.028
Let me show you something.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.530
I stayed up all night
looking up references to prep.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.620
- What the hell is that?
- You know Kenneth Anger?

30:31.455 --> 30:32.913
Experimental filmmaker.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.541
René always mentions
him as an inspiration.

30:37.376 --> 30:38.919
Should I know him?

30:39.004 --> 30:41.923
He doesn't see himself
as a director, but as a magus.

30:42.716 --> 30:45.761
- You mean a magician?
- No, magicians do tricks.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.182
A magus believes in...
invisible forces.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.143
He believes that
actors are spirits

30:53.225 --> 30:55.060
and movies are magic rituals.

30:55.645 --> 30:59.316
And what exactly is the purpose
of movies as magic rituals?

30:59.858 --> 31:01.485
To invoke Lucifer.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.298
You mean some sort
of satanic ceremony?

31:24.383 --> 31:26.091
No, not at all.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.135
It's like Lucifer
is the fallen angel

31:29.638 --> 31:31.431
but he's literally
the carrier of light.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.391
His movies are about
conjuring Lucifer?

31:34.725 --> 31:36.937
No, they're about
accessing that light.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.189
What's your point?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.191
All movies are about
accessing the light.

31:42.274 --> 31:43.860
All movies are about...

31:46.195 --> 31:48.239
- Maybe the good ones.
- Yeah, the good ones.

31:49.740 --> 31:51.701
And if you don"t believe
in the invisible,

31:51.785 --> 31:53.787
then you just don"t
make good movies.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.247
Is this something that they
taught you in film school?

31:56.330 --> 31:59.042
No, and this is the part of cinema
you gotta learn by yourself.

31:59.708 --> 32:01.252
No one teaches you that.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.128
You know you sound
exactly like René?

32:04.464 --> 32:07.007
- Your blouse.
- Thank you, Ms. Director.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.177
Only for the day.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.555
And then I'll turn back
into my usual pumpkin.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.518
Look, here's Anaiis Nin
as Astarte.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.146
- Goddess of the Moon.
- She plays Astarte?

32:19.562 --> 32:22.940
No. I mean, she's...
being Astarte.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.484
You know, that"s
the major difference.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.029
So, you mean that
I have to be Irma Vep?

32:28.989 --> 32:31.991
No, you have to let
Irma Vep be you.

32:32.074 --> 32:34.118
For "The Vampires"
to be a better show?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.661
For "The Vampires" to be art.

32:36.662 --> 32:38.415
- As opposed to?
- Entertainment.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.293
It's not supposed
to be entertaining?

32:41.375 --> 32:43.587
Well, of course, it's supposed
to be entertaining,

32:43.670 --> 32:45.087
but it could be more than that.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.258
So, how do you
see your first shot?

32:53.387 --> 32:57.225
First, the camera's here...
the entrance to Moreno"s flat.

32:58.350 --> 33:02.606
And then, we have a close-up
of the nefarious Satanas

33:03.814 --> 33:06.568
as he puts on his
poisonous spike.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.946
Then he rings Moreno's bell

33:10.697 --> 33:14.326
to confront him and Irma Vep about
the Grand Vampire's murder.

33:18.704 --> 33:20.789
Moreno and Irma Vep
had just finished hiding

33:20.874 --> 33:22.625
the Grand Vampire's body
in a chest.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.851
"Not the paralyptic spike!"

33:41.478 --> 33:42.729
And action.

33:53.822 --> 33:56.533
Don't worry, my dear.
He's only paralyzed.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.412
In five minutes,
he'll be back to normal.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.999
And he will have
learned his lesson.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.418
No one messes with The Vampires.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.089
The man you killed
and whose body...

34:11.508 --> 34:14.218
is in this trunk,
was a subordinate.

34:15.053 --> 34:19.307
I, Satanas...
am the true Grand Vampire.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.729
I want you to join The Vampires.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.401
If you don't swear your allegiance
to me by tomorrow,

34:30.317 --> 34:32.236
you will be killed at 2 AM.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.116
The next night,
Moreno and Irma Vep dine

34:37.199 --> 34:38.951
at a cabaret in Montmartre.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.265
You have declinde my generous
offer to join the Vampires

35:00.347 --> 35:02.474
at 2 a.m., you will die.
Satans the Grand Vampire

35:09.189 --> 35:11.901
And now, we bring you
an excerpt from Musidora's memoir...

35:13.944 --> 35:17.157
The morning we shot
the memorable cabaret scene,

35:17.823 --> 35:21.201
I received a telegram from Director
Feuillade which read:

35:22.162 --> 35:27.334
"Please report to the Gaumont studio,
for the shoot of a hazardous scene"

35:28.709 --> 35:32.713
"Bring an elegant but used gown,
for it might be damaged."

35:32.797 --> 35:35.049
"I put it all in a box,"

35:36.133 --> 35:41.847
"and headed" to the nearby
metro station, Botzaris,"

35:42.264 --> 35:44.016
"with my
precious dress in hand."

35:44.391 --> 35:46.977
Yesterday you said it wasn't dear,
so I drew it out for you.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.065
- What's this?
- That's our scene.

35:50.147 --> 35:51.231
Continue.

35:52.691 --> 35:56.071
My partner Femand Herrmann,
who played Moreno,

35:56.570 --> 35:58.907
was waiting
for me on the cabaret set.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.451
Madam Musidora...

36:02.869 --> 36:05.829
This is the cabaret, where I'm treating
you to dinner.

36:06.413 --> 36:10.710
Gaumont Productions
is footing the bill.

36:12.503 --> 36:17.841
The champagne is flowing.
Have a taste. Enioy.

36:23.680 --> 36:30.105
- Warm beer. Could be worse.
- No ice in the bucket...

36:30.605 --> 36:34.150
D'accord, d'accord.

36:36.610 --> 36:41.281
This is the message from Satanas.
He will strike at 2 a.m. 2 a.m!

36:50.291 --> 36:52.835
Excuse me.
What are you supposed to be?

36:53.752 --> 36:56.880
- A tango dancer. Shit!
- Sit. You'll dine instead.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.970
Come with me. You're not dining.

37:02.052 --> 37:05.222
You're wearing a tuxedo with a white tie,
which makes no sense.

37:05.305 --> 37:07.474
- You'll be a waiter.
- Oui.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.893
Have wardrobe put
a towel on your arm.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.187
Ok.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.899
I'll set the scene. You're socialites,
in high spirits.

37:14.983 --> 37:19.112
When the dancers enter, I want
everyone looking at them.

37:20.487 --> 37:24.701
Silence, please! Irma Vep
and her lover Moreno have just

37:24.784 --> 37:29.705
received word that Satanas is still
planning to kill them here at 2 a.m.

37:30.457 --> 37:35.837
And listen up, everyone. There are
two categories of extras today.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.966
The regular extras will earn
the usual daily rate.

37:40.049 --> 37:45.680
Those directly affected by the
blast will get double the rate.

37:46.306 --> 37:51.602
If you're interested in double pay,
step now to your left.

37:53.228 --> 38:00.153
All others to your right.
Double pay is that way.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.576
For safety, go behind that shield
while you're shooting.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.495
I'm gonna get behind the shield.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.370
- Mr. Feuillade!
- Yes?

38:10.454 --> 38:11.955
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Yes.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.125
I think you're going to be very happy
with my explosive.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.087
A renowned pyrotechnician
gave me the formula.

38:18.837 --> 38:21.965
However, I'm afraid some extras
may get injured.

38:23.008 --> 38:26.846
Injuries are fine.
We're ready to shoot.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.849
Meanwhile, at Satana's hideout
across the street...

38:51.246 --> 38:53.540
"Open the window, so I can aim
at the cabaret."

38:55.667 --> 38:57.502
Extras, we're shooting!

38:59.170 --> 39:00.420
Dance!

39:02.005 --> 39:07.053
Very good. Enter, waiter.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.848
Serve the glass of champagne.
Then pour some wine

39:11.932 --> 39:14.643
for the lone customer
at the next table.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.483
Then serve Moreno and Musidora.

39:20.899 --> 39:22.068
Waiter.

39:24.069 --> 39:25.280
Champagne.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.408
Serve them!

39:31.743 --> 39:33.037
Musidora toasts...

39:33.121 --> 39:34.371
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.082
And drinks.

39:42.087 --> 39:44.214
Here comes the signal.

39:59.396 --> 40:02.482
The set collapsed on top of us.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.736
We thought we were dead.

40:06.446 --> 40:10.199
I can't hear a thing!
I've gone deaf!

40:11.450 --> 40:14.287
It's the end of my career!

40:18.499 --> 40:21.544
For a bomb, that was some bomb!

40:22.377 --> 40:24.838
Triple pay for all the wounded!

40:30.719 --> 40:35.891
Don't, don't leave any messages.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.227
I will never return them.
Thank you.

40:46.401 --> 40:48.696
Have you arrived?
Want have a drink?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.239
Can I see u?

43:48.917 --> 43:51.336
We could redo the buttons.
We could send it to Mike.

43:51.419 --> 43:52.963
He did all the buttons
for "Doomsday."

43:53.046 --> 43:54.257
He'll do it, you think?

43:54.340 --> 43:56.675
Yeah, we have plenty of buttons
leftover from "Doomsday."

43:56.759 --> 43:59.887
Okay. Enough about me.
How was your day?

44:00.720 --> 44:03.099
We just rode around,
looked at all the main sets.

44:03.473 --> 44:04.849
Just to get the mood.

44:04.933 --> 44:06.769
I can get a vibe
of what's goin' on.

44:06.853 --> 44:09.104
- Okay, did you like it?
- Not really, no.

44:09.688 --> 44:13.358
You start tomorrow. That doesn't
really give them much time to fix things.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.443
Why is why I have to fix
the most important things.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.571
René, cheap ass.
I mean, not cheap.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.283
In the art world,
they call it a minimalist.

44:20.657 --> 44:23.201
He's a minimalist.
Not me. I like big shit.

44:23.785 --> 44:25.412
- I know.
- It's frustrating.

44:25.912 --> 44:29.125
There's this scene where this bomb
is supposed to go off in this nightclub.

44:29.208 --> 44:31.836
He wanna shoot it in a dump.
You don't shoot that in no dump.

44:31.919 --> 44:35.047
You go to Moulin Rouge,
or Folies Bergere, or somethin' big.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.426
Fuck that little shit.
You know what I'm sayin'?

44:39.510 --> 44:41.679
Herman, this is a TV show,
not a movie.

44:42.512 --> 44:46.141
- They don't have the budget.
- I know. But at the end of the day.

44:46.224 --> 44:48.477
I'm just trying to do
my best with what I know.

44:48.561 --> 44:50.812
Hollywood, blockbusters.
I grew up on 'em.

44:51.230 --> 44:54.192
- Didn"t mean to judge.
- I know I'm not a Coen Brothers.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.152
Them motherfuckers are geniuses.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.695
- No...
- Yeah.

44:58.778 --> 45:01.197
I hate when you do that.
Don't be self-deprecating.

45:01.281 --> 45:04.243
You're going to make...
great movies one day.

45:04.326 --> 45:06.787
- If movies are still being made.
- No, they will.

45:07.495 --> 45:09.164
- I got somethin' for you.
- What?

45:09.248 --> 45:10.791
- I got a surprise.
- What?

45:10.875 --> 45:12.376
Yeah... Don't move.

45:12.877 --> 45:15.129
- Are we celebrating something?
- One second.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.550
You're crazy.

45:35.649 --> 45:36.984
Yes.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.072
Baby...

45:41.739 --> 45:43.448
- Pick a hand.
- Left hand.

45:43.531 --> 45:44.991
Both, come on!

45:48.579 --> 45:50.539
It's a surprise.
Open it, it don't bite.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.714
- Herman.
- What, you don't like it?

45:59.799 --> 46:00.967
It's so beautiful.

46:02.217 --> 46:04.512
It's an apology for takin'
a hack job in Paris.

46:05.137 --> 46:08.014
- I never said it was a hack job.
- You kinda said it was a hack job.

46:08.098 --> 46:09.892
Okay, fine, I said
it was a hack job.

46:10.642 --> 46:12.019
- Wanna put it on?
- Yes.

46:12.102 --> 46:17.108
Let's do it.
This latch can be tricky.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.736
I mean, French latches.

46:24.490 --> 46:25.574
Voila.

46:33.039 --> 46:35.750
- It's gorgeous. Damn!
- I don't wanna break it.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.836
Here, let me help
you take it off.

46:41.965 --> 46:47.595
- It's so pretty.
- Mamacita!

46:50.640 --> 46:52.934
Yeah, what's up?
Shit.

46:53.728 --> 46:54.894
Goddamn!

46:56.604 --> 46:59.023
- Have you heard from Mira?
- Been avoiding her.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.528
She been askin' about you.
She said she texted you.

47:03.361 --> 47:08.575
Yeah, I've been busy.
I'll respond tomorrow.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.078
- Maybe.
- You"re just toyin' with her.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.789
Herman, she used me
as her sex slave.

47:15.124 --> 47:17.043
Come on, babe.
That's a bit dramatic.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.086
Yeah, well...
she doesn't like that

47:19.170 --> 47:21.463
I'm not the submissive
groupie she once knew.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.676
- I'm a woman.
- Yes, you are.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.763
I'm not a puppet.

47:32.515 --> 47:34.142
- You want revenge?
- No.

47:34.727 --> 47:38.146
But I won't let things spin out
of control again, that's for sure.

47:38.229 --> 47:40.774
- Such a badass.
- Yes, I'm a badass.

47:41.941 --> 47:43.235
I'm a badass.

47:48.072 --> 47:49.950
You know I'm ticklish there.
Stop it!

47:55.997 --> 47:57.373
Baby.

48:56.891 --> 49:00.061
Subtitle made for...
