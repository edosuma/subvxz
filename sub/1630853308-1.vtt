WEBVTT

00:16.975 --> 00:18.435
You have to stay in there.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.666
Hey.

00:42.793 --> 00:43.794
Do you mind?

00:44.837 --> 00:47.881
It's just the old knee…

00:49.216 --> 00:50.968
locks up after it rains.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.971
It didn't rain.

00:56.431 --> 00:59.560
Oh, no, no. Not here.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.105
Not yet.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.776
You… make yourself a big top?

01:09.152 --> 01:10.362
So, what's what?

01:10.445 --> 01:11.613
No, no. Don't tell me.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.740
What's this? Ferris wheel?

01:15.284 --> 01:16.368
Yeah?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.704
And-- This?

01:21.707 --> 01:22.833
Tight rope?

01:23.625 --> 01:24.793
What about this?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.254
This must be…

01:28.839 --> 01:30.757
Well, what's this? This is a…

01:32.342 --> 01:34.052
-tiger?
-Lion.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.889
Lion?
Ringmaster teach you how to tame him?

01:37.472 --> 01:39.224
No? Oh, boy.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.894
What a shitty ringmaster he is, huh?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.898
Here. Let's see.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.650
Oh, yeah.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.405
Yeah. He wants out.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.282
Here.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.785
Come on.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.838
There.

02:11.173 --> 02:16.261
At first, we find its shine,
and then we take it away.

02:29.358 --> 02:33.445
Now, a filly doesn't draw a crowd,

02:33.529 --> 02:35.989
but she's easier to break.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.204
Can you hold onto it for me
until I come back?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.456
I don't want it.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.217
You'll take it.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.762
You always do.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.564
Hi, Grendel.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.079
We'll also get some advice on
how to talk to your children

04:47.162 --> 04:48.872
about this troubled world…

04:49.540 --> 04:50.958
Did you go on last night?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.544
Jesus Lizard went long.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.046
Ate up my set.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.718
I don't need all this stuff.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.305
Your cousin only drinks
out of old Burger King cups.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.016
You're gonna want these
when you get down to Florida.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.603
You know, just so you know,
I can't cover this place on my own.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.981
I'm not holding your room for you.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.362
Buy cat food if you go out. Bye, Mom.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.305
Oh, hey.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.724
Did you get those city records
I asked you to pull?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.188
Where's the tenth
and 16th districting maps?

06:36.271 --> 06:40.192
Those need to come from Sulzer Public.
They said top of next week.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.529
But you should resubmit the request.
My last day's Friday.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.823
Sorry we're losing you--

06:48.450 --> 06:49.952
-Kirby.
-Right.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.454
Can you transfer the pickup
to someone else?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.513
I'm heading out. Do you need anything?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.223
No, I'm good.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.161
Come on! Get out of here!

07:33.245 --> 07:35.038
…across a 12-block radius.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.666
Power and gas
have been shut off as a precaution.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.168
But if you think about it--

07:45.090 --> 07:47.467
Well, they gotta move that truck.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.377
Hey! You can't be down here.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.296
Dan Velazquez. I'm with the Sun-Times.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.174
-You need to head back up now.
-What's going on there?

08:27.257 --> 08:29.885
They're just trying to patch a way
through the sewer lines.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.261
No hard hats?

08:32.054 --> 08:34.431
DOT is upstairs,
and half the 26th is down here.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.393
City called a state of emergency.
All hands on deck.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.104
This pipe's clear
for the first time in 50 years.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.232
What'd you find in there?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.858
When we find something,
we'll let you know.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.529
Sir, when you're ready.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.450
Careful with her leg.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.536
Get ready to move her out now.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.520
What's up?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.730
Why are you at my computer?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.650
What? I have to get this upstairs by 4:00.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.611
Is your computer not working?

09:31.530 --> 09:32.656
This is mine.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.950
Since when?

09:36.702 --> 09:39.746
Since always. Are you serious?

09:41.665 --> 09:42.916
You're over there, Kirby.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.090
You okay?

09:53.802 --> 09:56.013
Yeah. Sorry.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.970
Some guy called for you.
Shawn Lynsky?

10:38.514 --> 10:41.767
He called, like, five times.
Your friends can't tie up our line.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.568
We'll put some resources on it.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.612
-I'm already on it.
-Okay, slow down.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.532
Finish one story then start another.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.993
Ben and Lakshmi have the flood covered,
Abby. They don't need me.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.913
But we agreed.
You come back for some small pieces.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.499
Meet your deadlines,
and we'll go from there.

11:05.582 --> 11:09.711
Hey, Ronnie Samuels over from the 26th
says you were running hot with him.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.171
I don't know who that is.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.549
A police source. A reliable one.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.426
Did he mention anything
about the tunnels off LaSalle?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.011
No.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.598
It's his beat.

11:24.476 --> 11:28.605
City workers found a body
in a pipe off LaSalle.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.066
A young woman called Julia Madrigal.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.236
She went missing two years ago.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.321
I'm just polishing up
the Rochester shooting.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.573
I can run the legwork--

11:37.656 --> 11:40.409
-I'm good. I'm good.
-Bertie's been filling in for you.

11:40.492 --> 11:44.329
He's making inroads with the 26th.
They like him over there.

11:45.998 --> 11:48.250
People like me, Abby.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.712
Build back some goodwill. Run with it.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.841
Where'd you come up
with the name Mazrachi?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.427
National Geographic.
It's some photographer.

11:59.178 --> 12:02.764
-And Kirby?
-I don't know. Sounded fun.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.850
And has it been?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.271
You know, it's important
to regain a sense of control.

12:09.897 --> 12:14.318
A new name, new look,
those are good steps towards that.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.988
You can't call me at work.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.115
Well, your mom wouldn't pick up my calls.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.410
Yeah. After six years, probably not.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.874
We found a woman in a city pipe.

12:30.626 --> 12:33.086
Julia Madrigal. You know her?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.089
Did you find him?

12:36.798 --> 12:39.426
There were similarities
between your assault and Julia's murder.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.014
-What kind?
-I can't discuss specifics.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.100
It would jeopardize the conviction.
But we have a suspect.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.438
I need you to pick him out.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.773
You sure it's him?

12:52.856 --> 12:55.108
I have never asked you down here before.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.532
Take your time.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.126
-I don't know.
-You don't know what you know

13:13.210 --> 13:14.419
until it's looking right at you.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.839
-What's his name?
-I can't tell you that. Just--

13:17.506 --> 13:19.883
Look these over
and see if something clicks.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.137
What about these?

13:26.223 --> 13:27.766
Really look.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.522
-Kirby.
-I don't know,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.732
because I don't know what he looks like.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.693
Okay?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.573
He could be the guy at A&amp;P
bagging my milk.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.116
He could be the creep behind me.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.326
He could be the asshole
holding up the door.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.204
He's everybody. He's nobody.
He's all the fucking time.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.666
-Can you remember anything?
-Yeah.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.710
His voice when he called me a whore.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.799
This is Quincy.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.052
Doors closing.

14:32.581 --> 14:37.336
So, the room gets great light,
and it also-- It has a fan over--

14:38.128 --> 14:41.507
-Pretty fucking hot roommate.
-Yeah, you're pretty hot.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.761
Hey, Kirby. You there, honey?

14:46.595 --> 14:47.846
Kirby?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.058
Kirby.

14:52.976 --> 14:56.230
Do you wanna see my room? It's got
four walls and everything, big guy.

14:56.313 --> 14:59.483
Get over there!
Yeah, definitely.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.070
Oh, my gosh. You are sick.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.885
Jinny, Theo was looking for you.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.388
He said Granger won't be free
for your run-through until tomorrow.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.724
That's fine.
There's still time before the opening.

16:55.807 --> 16:56.808
Where are the kids?

16:56.892 --> 16:59.061
They were getting antsy.
I had to send 'em down.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.395
Okay.

17:17.329 --> 17:21.916
…are our bolometer readings.
They're how bright each star shines.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.464
And we use them to measure
how far the stars are away from us.

17:27.548 --> 17:29.466
Do you know what's even better than stars?

17:29.967 --> 17:31.718
Telescopes.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.720
We have some upstairs.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.931
You can try
and find your homes from there.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.101
Thank the scientist. Come on, guys.
Let's head out.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.811
-Thank you!
-Okay.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.563
You're welcome. Bye.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.064
Bye, guys. Have fun.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.902
You know, they're not gonna see anything
with the rain.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.738
Doesn't matter. Let them mess around.
They might get into it.

17:53.282 --> 17:56.410
Somehow, I do not think that
we have any Keplers in that bunch.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.413
Were you able to calibrate Ogden
for the live feed?

17:59.496 --> 18:01.290
I can't have a lag during my talk.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.633
They carry messages from the heavens.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.054
The--

18:16.722 --> 18:20.017
The ancient Egyptians,
it's what they said about bees.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.061
Well, this one's not doing much.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.522
Has no wings.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.160
Sorry. Got caught on a call.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.456
-I heard you talked to the ME.
-Yes. Yeah. Thanks.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.292
Iris is always my first call.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.505
Blow me away. Who's the suspect?

18:49.588 --> 18:50.923
Pawel Banik.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.843
Victim was a social worker.
He was one of her cases.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.387
We had him in two years ago
when Julia went missing.

18:57.471 --> 19:00.599
-Got a confession.
-And you didn't charge him?

19:03.477 --> 19:05.062
What kind of social work Julia do?

19:05.145 --> 19:06.939
10-96s mostly.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.277
Did your suspect have a lawyer present?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.655
At the time, no.

19:16.615 --> 19:20.994
You railroaded a mentally ill man.
Violated his Miranda right.

19:21.078 --> 19:23.997
And now you want me to say
that he murdered someone.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.668
My wife used to read you on Sundays.
She thought you retired.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.670
No, I'm still here.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.339
If you say so. But I looked you up.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.051
Your charge sheet listed
a domestic write-up, Class A possession.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.886
What'd you get?

19:37.970 --> 19:39.179
I pled out for treatment.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.682
Well, that seems to be going well.

19:41.765 --> 19:47.437
Listen, I won't sell a case
you couldn't make two years ago, okay?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.231
I was there when they brought him in.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.693
Nobody took a phone book to the guy.
We just didn't have a body.

19:54.486 --> 19:57.114
You know, the McDonald's on Clinton
is close enough.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.866
Buy me a burger next time.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.176
-Jesus.
-Sorry.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.427
Hi.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.305
What are you listening to
that's got you so spaced out?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.223
Sometimes I just forget to take them off

20:23.307 --> 20:24.850
when the press isn't running.

20:28.896 --> 20:31.565
Okay. It's different.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.905
Can you file these
for Lakshmi's flood piece?

20:37.988 --> 20:40.199
-The ones for copy are flagged.
-Yeah, of course.

20:42.701 --> 20:43.869
Hey, Marcus.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.705
I really liked your outtakes
from city hall.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.665
I thought layout should've moved them up.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.085
Thank you. I was only messing around.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.714
Hey, hold up.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.593
-You don't--
-Yeah, yeah.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.056
Had to finish the roll.

21:05.057 --> 21:06.600
There's a good one of you in here.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.604
You pulling these for Dan?
'Cause he's waiting on 'em.

21:11.605 --> 21:15.359
-No-- No, I didn't. These are not--
-Hey, Dan. Kirby's got your clips.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.569
-Huh?
-No. They're…

21:17.653 --> 21:19.738
-For Julia Madrigal.
-Forget it. I'll--

21:19.821 --> 21:23.158
But I didn't put in any request.
You pull those for Bertie?

21:23.992 --> 21:24.910
Yeah.

21:27.704 --> 21:28.830
I--

21:34.294 --> 21:38.131
Puerile move, poaching a story
running on the same press.

21:38.215 --> 21:41.343
It's-- He knows better.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.258
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.927
Shit, shit, shit!

24:47.112 --> 24:47.946
Who are you?

24:48.906 --> 24:52.075
Hi. I'm with the Sun-Times.

24:52.159 --> 24:54.244
Is Pawel Banik here?

24:54.328 --> 24:58.165
You come about Julia?
We see you people all day.

24:58.749 --> 25:00.292
I can't make more tea.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.294
You come.

25:03.212 --> 25:06.798
Can he-- Can he come here?
We can talk outside, please?

25:06.882 --> 25:08.258
You come in.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.113
Pawel in here.

25:31.073 --> 25:32.074
Go in.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.647
Pawel. Are you Pawel?

26:45.731 --> 26:47.941
She likes the sound.

26:49.109 --> 26:50.527
What sound?

26:50.611 --> 26:53.947
The fuzzy sound, the TV. She likes it.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.325
Who?

26:57.743 --> 26:58.785
Julia?

26:58.869 --> 27:01.872
No. I don't hurt her.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.332
I can't see you.

27:03.415 --> 27:08.045
I told you I didn't do it.
I tell everybody I did not hurt Julia.

27:08.629 --> 27:10.172
Why are you talking like that?

27:10.255 --> 27:13.467
Like what? I only knew Julia five months.

27:13.550 --> 27:16.929
-Your voice. It's not--
-You'll wake her up.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.013
It's not--

27:19.181 --> 27:20.849
Why are you talking like that?

27:31.109 --> 27:32.361
I'm sorry.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.698
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.338
Hey.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.428
Number 31 is up.

28:01.098 --> 28:02.474
Sugar helps.

28:12.943 --> 28:14.778
What happened in that house?

28:17.573 --> 28:18.740
Nothing.

28:19.408 --> 28:23.495
He was just… putting his kid to bed.

28:25.205 --> 28:26.415
Who sent you over there?

28:28.458 --> 28:31.128
I talked to Bertie.
You're not helping him on the story.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.672
I never said I was. You did.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.384
Listen.

28:39.845 --> 28:44.224
If you're trying to get on a desk,
that's not a way to do it.

28:45.976 --> 28:47.895
I'm already leaving. You can't fire me.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.772
You get a better gig?

28:51.899 --> 28:53.775
I'm moving to Florida.

28:53.859 --> 28:55.110
Where to?

28:55.194 --> 28:56.361
Orlando.

28:56.445 --> 28:57.863
What's there?

28:59.531 --> 29:01.700
Just a cousin with a couch.

29:04.411 --> 29:05.287
It's a change.

29:06.496 --> 29:07.873
Yeah, it's a change.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.667
Number 32 is up.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.380
Food's up. I'll go grab it for us.

29:21.345 --> 29:22.429
Thank you.

29:35.359 --> 29:37.236
I wasn't trying to take your story.

29:41.406 --> 29:44.535
Is it personal? You know Julia?

29:48.413 --> 29:51.917
You don't seem like the kind of person
who would walk into a stranger's house.

29:52.793 --> 29:53.961
You knew Pawel?

29:57.214 --> 29:58.465
I thought I did.

29:59.883 --> 30:01.009
Why would you know him?

30:03.053 --> 30:05.597
The detective who was on my case…

30:08.100 --> 30:09.601
he called me in.

30:14.690 --> 30:19.278
Doesn't matter. It's--
I thought it did, but it doesn't.

30:20.904 --> 30:22.739
He called you in for what?

30:27.452 --> 30:29.371
He thought it was the same guy.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.136
What someone did to Julia…

30:45.929 --> 30:47.264
they tried to do to you?

30:51.518 --> 30:52.853
It was six years ago.

30:58.525 --> 31:02.321
Well, I get why you want a change.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.828
But you picked the one city in Florida
without a beach.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.342
Why did the detective
think it was the same guy?

31:28.972 --> 31:30.682
I was cut up like Julia.

31:32.351 --> 31:34.311
I saw it in your notes.

31:37.689 --> 31:41.944
But I heard his voice… Pawel.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.533
It wasn't him.

31:52.287 --> 31:54.540
What were you gonna do if it was?

32:06.802 --> 32:09.263
Hey. I think your graphics are
finished loading.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.056
It's not gonna take much longer.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.559
Do you wanna grab some lunch?

32:16.979 --> 32:17.980
Right.

32:21.984 --> 32:26.071
So, I'll just swing by security
and let 'em know about the roof door.

32:26.154 --> 32:29.324
Don't worry about it.
I should've had my keys.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.635
Our universe is a vast expanse
of gas and dust.

32:48.719 --> 32:51.930
Constantly colliding, evolving, expanding.

32:52.014 --> 32:55.350
It is the cradle for billions of stars.

32:55.434 --> 32:59.938
But all it takes is one star
to change the course of a galaxy,

33:00.022 --> 33:02.900
a billion years into the future.

33:08.614 --> 33:12.201
Please remember
to gather all your personal belongings

33:12.284 --> 33:14.953
and visit the stars again soon.

33:42.689 --> 33:44.608
That was just beautiful.

33:46.568 --> 33:49.696
You know, I haven't seen
anything that good in a long time.

33:50.864 --> 33:52.991
The-- The show.

33:56.787 --> 33:57.913
Yeah.

33:59.790 --> 34:01.792
You don't think so?

34:03.544 --> 34:06.505
Yeah. I try and catch it
at least once a week.

34:06.588 --> 34:07.673
You do?

34:07.756 --> 34:09.757
You must have it memorized by now, huh?

34:09.842 --> 34:13.094
-Pretty much, but I don't mind.
-Yeah.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.264
You know,
they did leave some things out, though.

34:16.348 --> 34:20.101
Yeah. Basically, all the stars
that you do see, they're all dead.

34:20.185 --> 34:24.731
Yeah. The ones that are shining,
they're exploding in on themselves. So…

34:24.815 --> 34:27.693
Actually, that's only true
for the most distant stars.

34:27.775 --> 34:31.196
The ones in our galaxy,
they live on long past us.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.116
Yeah, well…

34:36.994 --> 34:39.413
That's not how I heard it. So…

34:41.540 --> 34:44.626
You should try and check out
the three o'clock lunar display.

34:44.710 --> 34:47.754
-We just started running it.
-Oh, yeah. Sure.

34:49.590 --> 34:51.300
I'll be sure to do that, Jinny.

34:56.722 --> 34:58.765
I mean, I thought I--
I'd give you a minute,

34:58.849 --> 35:01.018
but you still don't recognize me?

35:02.144 --> 35:04.104
Have you been on one of my tours?

35:04.855 --> 35:05.939
No.

35:09.151 --> 35:10.485
Then I don't know you.

35:12.154 --> 35:14.072
No, not today.

35:16.158 --> 35:17.367
I guess not.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.247
Listen-- I'm sorry.
I'm making you nervous. I--

35:23.040 --> 35:25.542
I'm just here to look at the stars,
you know?

35:39.848 --> 35:42.434
She thinks
she was attacked by the same man.

35:43.268 --> 35:45.020
All her scars…

35:45.103 --> 35:46.813
-Okay.
-…might match Julia Madrigal's.

35:46.897 --> 35:49.399
-Really? I'll see. I'll do what I can.
-Let's get that--

35:49.483 --> 35:51.151
Kirby.

35:51.235 --> 35:54.154
-So, Kirby.
-I'm hoping I can help.

35:54.238 --> 35:55.572
I think you can, yes.

35:55.656 --> 35:58.158
So, Kirby, this is my friend, Iris.

35:58.242 --> 35:59.785
Kirby, it's so nice to meet you.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.832
Don't worry. They can't get out.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.255
Come on in.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.178
Here, have a seat.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.101
Thanks.

36:24.184 --> 36:27.771
First time Dan came here,
I couldn't get him past the door.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.022
Yeah.

36:29.106 --> 36:31.400
She wasn't handing out candy back then.

36:32.693 --> 36:34.611
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

36:36.530 --> 36:39.908
I forget everything.
It's from the formaldehyde.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.827
Now they're saying we have to wear masks,

36:41.910 --> 36:43.996
but after 40 years, what does it matter?

36:45.122 --> 36:49.543
Okay. So, you were assaulted, yes?

36:50.252 --> 36:51.253
Yeah.

36:52.171 --> 36:54.464
Aggravated assault 'cause he had a knife.

36:55.132 --> 36:56.800
They identify the instrument?

36:57.301 --> 36:59.761
No, but there was wood in the handle.

37:00.470 --> 37:01.972
They found some under my nails.

37:02.556 --> 37:07.769
The incisions on Julia
were distinct. Practiced.

37:08.645 --> 37:11.565
Is there scar tissue from your wounds?

37:13.275 --> 37:14.693
Across my stomach.

37:15.569 --> 37:16.820
Lateral, medial?

37:18.405 --> 37:20.073
That's up and down, or side to side.

37:21.950 --> 37:22.951
Both.

37:23.493 --> 37:24.953
How thick is that scarring?

37:25.037 --> 37:27.122
An inch. Maybe half an inch.

37:29.875 --> 37:34.630
So, would you say the size
of my eraser or my fingernail?

37:37.007 --> 37:38.717
Sorry. I don't know.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.093
Could I see them?

37:40.677 --> 37:41.803
I'll step out.

37:47.351 --> 37:49.520
I told you what the scar looks like, so--

37:49.603 --> 37:51.939
Well, the distinction
of half an inch is relevant.

37:52.022 --> 37:55.275
It tells me about the blade,
your positioning, his mindset.

37:55.359 --> 37:58.737
I told them all of this when it happened.
It didn't help.

38:01.448 --> 38:04.868
There could be forensic similarities
between you and Julia.

38:05.369 --> 38:09.831
But if you wanna know if your lacerations
are identical, I could probably tell you.

38:10.415 --> 38:12.084
But I have to examine them.

38:15.254 --> 38:18.465
Okay. Why don't you come on over here
where the light's better?

38:21.343 --> 38:22.928
-On that table?
-Yeah.

38:24.596 --> 38:26.473
These are still warm from the dryer.

38:29.852 --> 38:30.978
Okay.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.235
Hop on up, my dear.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.128
All right.

38:59.548 --> 39:00.841
All right.

39:02.342 --> 39:03.510
Okay.

39:04.761 --> 39:05.971
Okay.

39:06.054 --> 39:08.182
I think maybe I need glasses.

39:10.475 --> 39:11.602
All right.

39:12.477 --> 39:15.564
All right. He started on the anterior.

39:16.523 --> 39:18.025
You were on the ground?

39:20.485 --> 39:21.987
He came up behind me.

39:23.864 --> 39:25.908
He threw me down. So I was on my back.

39:27.701 --> 39:31.538
There's a stutter here.
He was interrupted?

39:32.414 --> 39:33.916
Yeah, someone walked past.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.584
You couldn't call to them?

39:37.586 --> 39:40.088
There was some-- stuff in my mouth.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.341
Was walking my dog.

39:45.844 --> 39:47.804
He shoved something in it.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.766
There's tearing here.

39:51.683 --> 39:54.770
Was anything removed
from your abdominal cavity?

39:58.690 --> 40:00.317
Some of my intestines.

40:01.860 --> 40:06.365
I didn't remember it,
but the doctor told me after.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.788
Did he leave something inside her?

40:16.625 --> 40:18.752
Was there something inside Julia?

40:23.131 --> 40:24.216
What's that, my dear?

40:24.299 --> 40:26.260
-Don't touch me. Get off me.
-What? Relax.

40:26.343 --> 40:27.719
Get the fuck off me.

40:27.803 --> 40:29.721
-Who are you?
-I'm--

40:29.805 --> 40:31.890
-Who are you? Where's Iris?
-What's going on?

40:31.974 --> 40:33.100
Don't touch me. Where's Iris?

40:33.183 --> 40:35.102
We were almost done.
I don't know what happened.

40:35.185 --> 40:37.312
-Who's that? Where is Iris?
-Calm down.

40:37.396 --> 40:38.647
This is Howard.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.858
-Who is Howard?
-Howard is the medical examiner.

40:40.941 --> 40:43.318
-What happened to Iris?
-Hey, who is Iris?

40:43.402 --> 40:44.862
Kirby, hey.

40:45.946 --> 40:48.615
Do you want me to call her? Who is she?

40:48.699 --> 40:50.701
You said it was okay
for him to examine you.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.036
You okay?

40:56.498 --> 40:58.667
Why the fuck did you bring me here?

41:08.594 --> 41:09.761
What happened?

41:09.845 --> 41:11.680
I don't know.

41:38.707 --> 41:42.836
Voices voices

41:42.920 --> 41:45.881
Beckoning sea

41:45.964 --> 41:47.799
Come

41:48.300 --> 41:51.303
Come, come

41:51.386 --> 41:52.387
Mom.

41:53.222 --> 41:55.891
Mom, Janet will call the super again.

42:07.611 --> 42:08.779
What are these?

42:09.988 --> 42:12.658
Those were the only ones
I could find in a full set.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.662
You're gonna need extras
when you have people over.

42:19.748 --> 42:20.749
You okay, babe?

42:21.500 --> 42:24.628
I mean, they're just shitty plates.

42:24.711 --> 42:26.797
Your cousin's probably
gonna steal them anyway.

42:27.422 --> 42:29.132
No, it's not that.

42:32.261 --> 42:34.388
You don't have to move
if you don't want to.

42:35.931 --> 42:37.474
I can't stay here.

42:40.185 --> 42:41.186
Why?

42:43.355 --> 42:45.440
After what he did to me…

42:49.111 --> 42:50.612
Things aren't how they should be.

42:51.989 --> 42:53.907
You're just still working through it.

42:54.867 --> 42:55.993
No.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.245
No, Mom.

42:59.371 --> 43:00.706
It's not that.

43:02.583 --> 43:04.084
We've talked about this.

43:05.794 --> 43:07.796
Everything is like always.

43:09.965 --> 43:11.091
And then it's not.

43:14.261 --> 43:15.929
Things change. They're--

43:17.973 --> 43:20.642
They're not how I left them.

43:23.896 --> 43:27.482
Nothing is where it should be,

43:27.566 --> 43:31.528
and I don't recognize it anymore.

43:35.908 --> 43:37.534
You did not tell me that.

43:40.996 --> 43:43.123
It starts with these little things.

43:48.795 --> 43:50.172
And then big things.

43:56.470 --> 43:58.805
Remember that prick, Jason?

44:02.476 --> 44:04.436
Yeah. Aunt Darlene's first husband?

44:04.520 --> 44:06.522
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah?

44:06.605 --> 44:08.190
She gives him three boys,

44:08.273 --> 44:10.734
and the way he says thanks is
to walk out on them.

44:11.693 --> 44:13.403
Well, we found him…

44:14.947 --> 44:16.281
twelve years later,

44:17.032 --> 44:19.159
living in a commune in Oregon.

44:20.619 --> 44:22.287
He went looking for peace and quiet.

44:22.371 --> 44:25.541
He ended up on a dirt farm
with another five kids.

44:27.876 --> 44:28.877
And?

44:32.589 --> 44:35.843
Moving across country is not gonna
get you something different.

44:40.681 --> 44:43.976
If you wanna stop feeling this way,
you better figure it out right here.

45:12.671 --> 45:13.964
I thought you gave a notice.

45:14.965 --> 45:16.633
You're off. You know it's not Pawel.

45:17.217 --> 45:20.512
This is what I have,
and it's already late.

45:22.556 --> 45:25.475
I know what happened to me.
It's what happened to Julia.

45:26.185 --> 45:28.145
Did you talk to Howard?

45:28.228 --> 45:30.731
Yeah. You scared the shit out of him.

45:36.278 --> 45:38.614
Julia's attacker left something
inside of her.

45:38.697 --> 45:40.574
Ask Howard. He'll find it.

45:43.160 --> 45:44.912
You coming?

45:48.248 --> 45:49.499
Listen.

45:51.251 --> 45:52.920
I appreciate you know what you know.

45:56.006 --> 45:58.133
But I can't credit you on your impulse.

45:58.217 --> 46:01.386
It's not an impulse.
It is what happened to me.

46:01.470 --> 46:05.390
It is the only record I have,
and it is the only one that matters.

46:06.225 --> 46:07.267
It's not enough.

46:08.977 --> 46:10.479
It should be.

46:24.826 --> 46:26.870
The bid on the Navy Pier redevelopment,

46:26.954 --> 46:27.996
that should've come in.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.375
Yep. I'm already on it.
I just put a phone call in to Harrison.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.253
He assured me he will give me
a heads-up on the front-runner.

46:34.336 --> 46:37.798
Flush out quotes.
Try Dorchester at city hall.

46:39.091 --> 46:43.804
Dan, you gonna file on Julia Madrigal
this morning?

46:45.347 --> 46:47.224
I'm pursuing an alternate suspect.

46:49.351 --> 46:51.353
A possible serial offender.

46:54.273 --> 46:55.440
Where's this coming from?

46:57.442 --> 46:58.777
A source.

46:59.528 --> 47:00.654
A credible one?

47:03.657 --> 47:04.950
I don't know yet.

49:14.997 --> 49:16.206
Mom, let me in.

49:25.090 --> 49:26.091
No!

49:29.344 --> 49:30.596
No!

49:32.556 --> 49:35.225
Mom. Let me in.

49:51.325 --> 49:52.242
Let me in.

49:53.035 --> 49:54.369
Yeah?

49:57.289 --> 49:59.791
-Where's Rachel?
-Wrong apartment.

50:00.626 --> 50:03.921
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is 2B.

50:04.004 --> 50:05.672
Yeah. Number's right there.

50:06.840 --> 50:07.883
Hey.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.387
Rachel?

52:22.267 --> 52:23.352
Mom?

52:25.312 --> 52:26.647
Hey.

52:31.318 --> 52:33.070
At least you're here.

52:34.446 --> 52:35.447
Who's here?

52:45.791 --> 52:47.417
-Marcus?
-Hey.

52:48.126 --> 52:49.086
You all right?

52:52.881 --> 52:54.258
What's wrong?

52:56.134 --> 52:57.427
What happened?

52:59.888 --> 53:00.889
Nothing.

53:03.183 --> 53:04.810
I just came home.
