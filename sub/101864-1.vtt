02:10.889 --> 02:12.890
Come on, love.
You're gonna be late for school.

02:14.290 --> 02:15.823
All right, come.
Hold my hand.

02:17.956 --> 02:19.856
Watch this.
Get across the road.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.223
Hello, little Miss Daisy.

02:32.257 --> 02:33.823
Hello, Daddy.

02:33.856 --> 02:35.957
So you been a good girl
this year?

02:35.991 --> 02:37.824
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:37.857 --> 02:39.891
'Cause you know Santa only comes
if you've been a good girl.

02:39.924 --> 02:41.624
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:41.657 --> 02:43.891
And what do you hope
he brings you this year?

02:43.924 --> 02:45.757
I'd really like a pony.

02:45.791 --> 02:46.824
A pony?

02:48.024 --> 02:50.091
But isn't a pony a little bit
big to fit in your garden?

02:50.124 --> 02:52.024
- Where are you going to put it?
- In my room.

02:52.058 --> 02:53.757
- In your room?
- Yeah.

02:53.791 --> 02:54.791
Okay.

03:06.092 --> 03:08.625
- Where's all her friends?
- She doesn't have a lot

03:08.658 --> 03:11.025
since they all started going to
this after-school ballet class.

03:11.059 --> 03:12.858
So why didn't she go?

03:14.125 --> 03:16.758
It's nice you want
to be in her life, Mark.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.092
Didn't think you'd hang around,
to be honest,

03:18.125 --> 03:19.192
thought you
would have left by now.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.691
I'm not going anywhere.

03:26.726 --> 03:28.793
I've got a letter
from the council.

03:28.826 --> 03:30.826
They want to re-home.
It's something about Birmingham.

03:30.859 --> 03:32.759
Birmingham? You don't know
anyone there.

03:32.793 --> 03:34.726
I'm not going.

03:34.759 --> 03:36.626
Just saving every penny.

03:36.659 --> 03:37.959
See what happens.

03:51.261 --> 03:53.061
I'm told you haven't
been at the hostel.

03:54.227 --> 03:56.693
You know it's for your own good
to stay there, don't you?

03:57.794 --> 04:00.061
I need to work.

04:00.094 --> 04:02.194
Well, you need
to fix the dress, then.

04:02.227 --> 04:04.593
I'm not looking for handouts.

04:04.627 --> 04:06.261
I just want a job.
You can find me a job.

04:06.294 --> 04:08.294
But if you can't be trusted

04:08.327 --> 04:10.994
to be in the same place
you say you're going to be,

04:11.027 --> 04:13.362
there's really nothing I can do
to help you.

04:13.395 --> 04:16.594
I'm not just here
just to give out handouts.

04:16.628 --> 04:20.028
I need you to help yourself.

04:20.062 --> 04:22.828
But it has to be done
inside the system.

05:01.696 --> 05:03.030
That's lunch sorted, then.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.230
Fucking hell!

05:11.264 --> 05:13.763
I never thought
we'd see each other again.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.097
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

05:22.097 --> 05:23.864
Been a while, man.

05:23.898 --> 05:25.731
Too long.

05:25.764 --> 05:28.131
- Time moves fast.
- It has for you.

05:28.165 --> 05:30.864
So, what are you doing here?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.198
Same as you.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.564
Getting splinters
for shit money.

05:35.298 --> 05:36.697
Ain't freedom a bitch.

05:38.764 --> 05:40.697
Surprised to see you
doing all this.

05:41.798 --> 05:42.964
Got debts.

05:48.166 --> 05:50.299
You weren't settling
on doing this.

05:50.332 --> 05:51.865
Cash in hand.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.999
It's loose change, mate.

05:56.032 --> 05:57.799
Every penny counts.

05:57.832 --> 05:59.199
When you're a pauper.

06:06.932 --> 06:08.299
Ain't you forgetting something?

06:29.067 --> 06:30.633
It's all packed up, mate.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.167
It's all right if I take
some of these with me?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.866
Yeah, take whatever
you want, mate.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.599
I had to take a bit off,

06:35.634 --> 06:37.134
because obviously
you're using the tools.

06:37.168 --> 06:38.168
All right?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.235
You don't have to hang around,
you know.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.668
I'm all right on my own.

07:17.701 --> 07:19.202
It's a pleasure
to be here, Mark.

07:19.235 --> 07:20.601
Right.

07:30.869 --> 07:32.036
Want one?

07:32.070 --> 07:33.602
No.

07:39.903 --> 07:42.803
I reckon me and you can make
some serious money

07:42.836 --> 07:44.602
if we put our heads together.

07:44.636 --> 07:45.803
Yeah, right.

07:45.836 --> 07:47.303
Do a job.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.104
You know, a proper job.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.204
Nice and quick.

07:52.237 --> 07:54.770
Fuck off to Spain,
away from this shithole.

07:54.804 --> 07:56.670
Like you used
to speak about inside.

07:56.703 --> 08:00.570
We had to talk,
because we had nothing else.

08:02.037 --> 08:03.770
I've got a daughter, Alan.

08:03.804 --> 08:05.870
I can't just shoot off.

08:05.904 --> 08:07.304
Just think about it.

08:07.337 --> 08:09.603
The good life.

08:10.404 --> 08:11.838
You deserve it.

08:11.871 --> 08:13.272
We both do.

08:17.871 --> 08:19.738
Pick me up in the morning, yeah?

08:57.939 --> 09:00.107
All right, so you're saying

09:00.140 --> 09:02.640
when the aliens come down,
we'll say,

09:02.673 --> 09:05.973
"Yeah, here's a person
who represents us as a nation,"

09:06.007 --> 09:08.174
and old Liz bowls out
with her crown and shit,

09:08.207 --> 09:11.706
draped in diamonds and fur,
like, fucking do one!

09:11.740 --> 09:13.940
I can think of worse people
to represent us.

09:13.973 --> 09:15.907
That's all I'm saying.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.773
Do you reckon the queen
eats sausage rolls?

09:19.807 --> 09:21.706
Not from garages.

09:21.740 --> 09:24.141
Do you reckon the queen's
ever done, like, a belly flop

09:24.175 --> 09:25.774
or a bomb in the pool,

09:25.808 --> 09:28.841
really splashed Charles
right in the eyes?

09:28.874 --> 09:30.341
Reckon the queen's
played football?

09:30.375 --> 09:32.308
Of course she has.
She's the fucking queen.

09:32.341 --> 09:35.041
What, like gone on a run
and proper nutmeg Charles?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.874
I reckon she's got a wicked
left foot nobody knows about.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.707
Maybe.

09:39.741 --> 09:42.008
Bums it down the right
then switches it onto her left,

09:42.041 --> 09:43.641
leaving Charles on his back

09:43.674 --> 09:45.641
before curling past Harry
into the top corner.

09:45.674 --> 09:47.375
- It's possible.
- Of course it's possible.

09:47.408 --> 09:49.176
She'd buy the game off.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.376
You can talk all you want
about some nice old lady

09:51.409 --> 09:53.242
who speaks proper
representing us,

09:53.276 --> 09:55.642
but all these fucks in power
take their liberties

09:55.675 --> 09:56.842
because they can.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.176
Just wheel up the drawbridge

09:58.209 --> 09:59.975
and keep the gold inside
for themselves.

10:00.009 --> 10:01.742
Well, she's good for tourism.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.675
Tourism? Shut up.

10:05.975 --> 10:07.708
The fucking 1%, Mark.

10:07.742 --> 10:09.276
- What?
- I'm telling you, mate.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.177
There's people at the top
getting away with murder.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.143
As soon as they get
a little bit of power,

10:14.177 --> 10:15.776
they try and keep us down.

10:15.810 --> 10:17.643
I doubt the queen's buried
any bodies.

10:17.676 --> 10:19.010
No, of course she hasn't.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.676
She gets lackeys like us
to do it.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.010
Like that fucking foreman,

10:22.043 --> 10:23.743
he's paying us half
what he should.

10:23.776 --> 10:25.743
- He doesn't have to hire us.
- Yeah, well, he did,

10:25.776 --> 10:28.743
and we're working
just as hard.

10:28.776 --> 10:30.810
Did he give you extra
for the van?

10:32.343 --> 10:34.377
Exactly. My point exactly.

10:34.410 --> 10:37.111
He's an asshole
No, Mark, seriously, mate.

10:37.144 --> 10:39.044
He's a fucking prick.

10:39.078 --> 10:42.811
Oy! I've got the power.
Branch is coming down.

10:42.844 --> 10:45.178
Yeah, it's all right, mate.
You're all clear.

10:47.178 --> 10:50.211
You saw the look he gave you
when he paid you.

10:50.244 --> 10:51.977
It said, "Go fuck yourself."

10:52.011 --> 10:54.211
- Alan.
- You should say something.

10:55.777 --> 10:58.144
Mark, I need the money
just as much as you do.

10:58.178 --> 11:01.045
Are you going to keep letting
these pricks mug you off?

11:01.079 --> 11:03.045
Shut up and do some work, Alan.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.978
Whoa! Hey, hold up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it!

11:08.145 --> 11:09.912
Fucking thumb!

11:13.645 --> 11:15.812
You fucking idiot.
What did I tell you?

11:15.845 --> 11:18.212
- No pissing around on my jobs!
- He came out of nowhere.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.112
Yeah, you daydreaming fuckwit.

11:21.012 --> 11:22.611
Talk to me like that.

11:22.645 --> 11:24.712
Get off my fucking site, now!
Right now.

11:24.746 --> 11:26.612
- Fuck!
- Fucking go.

11:26.646 --> 11:28.080
Fuck!

11:29.413 --> 11:30.913
Come on at me, then!

11:33.113 --> 11:34.879
Well, now...

11:37.146 --> 11:39.080
What are you going to show me?

11:42.113 --> 11:43.813
I can do it.

11:43.846 --> 11:45.646
Is that it?

11:45.679 --> 11:47.046
No.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.247
Well, I'm not as good as you,
am I?

11:50.647 --> 11:52.281
Are you coming in
for dinner?

11:52.314 --> 11:55.880
Daddy's busy, darling.
Maybe another time, yeah?

11:55.914 --> 11:57.114
Oh, I love you, darling.

11:58.014 --> 11:59.214
See you.

12:02.414 --> 12:05.381
- Jules...
- Don't call me that.

12:05.414 --> 12:08.847
Look, I don't know how much
ballet stuff costs.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.348
That better not come from
where I think it does.

12:12.382 --> 12:14.681
- Of course not.
- I mean it, Mark.

12:14.714 --> 12:16.915
I don't want you bringing
trouble our way.

12:16.948 --> 12:18.981
It's from tree work.

12:19.015 --> 12:20.581
I promise.

12:23.981 --> 12:25.815
- Thanks.
- I'll see you later.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.284
I don't see what the problem is.

13:07.317 --> 13:11.616
They probably got work.
Real work.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.850
Real money.

13:12.883 --> 13:14.150
We both need it.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.716
You don't want to work for them.
Trust me.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.583
What's the worst
that could happen?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.184
Another six years.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.950
They owe you, then.

13:22.983 --> 13:24.984
You owe me two of them.

13:25.018 --> 13:27.018
You didn't complain
at the fucking time, did you?

13:27.051 --> 13:28.717
No!

13:28.751 --> 13:30.385
No, I don't think so, mate.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.684
I'm not having that, Mark.

13:37.385 --> 13:39.884
Well, they won't stop
contacting you.

13:40.818 --> 13:42.717
They want you,
they'll just keep going.

13:42.751 --> 13:45.818
The more you ignore them,
the more pissed off they'll get.

13:45.851 --> 13:47.952
You know as well
as I do, Mark...

13:50.319 --> 13:52.885
this won't end well.

14:07.219 --> 14:08.885
Think on it, brother...

14:09.919 --> 14:11.719
because the clock is ticking.

14:11.753 --> 14:13.220
Tick.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.053
Tick. Tick.

14:15.087 --> 14:17.287
Tick.

14:35.954 --> 14:37.687
Where'd you get
this shit heap?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.088
Motorway.

14:39.121 --> 14:41.254
What, my motor's
not good anymore?

14:41.288 --> 14:43.321
The last one wasn't.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.321
I heard you had
some trouble inside.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.054
Not the sort of thing
we can help with,

14:49.088 --> 14:51.754
but we made sure everything else
was comfortable.

14:53.121 --> 14:54.954
Good to have you back.

14:54.987 --> 14:56.754
Finally.

14:56.787 --> 14:58.787
I'm not back.
Not like that.

14:58.821 --> 15:01.621
Well, then why the fuck
are you here?

15:01.655 --> 15:02.922
MIT.

15:04.422 --> 15:06.955
I'll say.
It's a fucking write-off.

15:08.822 --> 15:11.022
Easy, Toni.
I'm just dropping...

15:12.055 --> 15:13.888
Oh, my gosh. Mark!

15:13.922 --> 15:15.621
Seamus.

15:15.655 --> 15:17.688
Fucking hell, man! Long time.

15:17.721 --> 15:19.822
Marky boy.
Let me just drop this off.

15:19.855 --> 15:22.189
- I'll come check you, yeah?
- Cool.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.956
- Who's the kid?
- Ted?

15:26.989 --> 15:30.190
Oh, he does bits and bobs
for me, this and that.

15:30.223 --> 15:31.956
Some of your old stuff.

15:31.989 --> 15:35.023
- A bit young, isn't it?
- Well, so were you.

15:35.056 --> 15:36.989
Ted stepped up,
sorted some trouble for me.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.789
What sort of trouble?

15:38.823 --> 15:42.156
I'll let Caddy tell you.
He wants to catch up.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.756
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

15:43.789 --> 15:45.823
Toni, I'm not back.

15:45.856 --> 15:48.091
There's a decent contract
with your name on it.

15:48.124 --> 15:49.757
Big numbers.

15:49.790 --> 15:52.990
Yeah, well, just let them know
that I said...

15:53.024 --> 15:56.124
That you came back to tell me
you're not coming back.

15:56.157 --> 15:58.357
I'm sure he'll understand.

16:00.024 --> 16:02.224
I'll be sure
to let him know, Mark.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.257
What did I do?

16:08.824 --> 16:11.125
Hey, Mark, drop some
for the crown, will you?

16:15.991 --> 16:18.958
Let's go.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.858
When are you going to come
around and see Pete, anyway?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.392
You'll be glad he missed you.

16:33.425 --> 16:36.193
Just busy at the moment,
trying to find work.

16:36.226 --> 16:37.826
Caddy will go fucking mental

16:37.859 --> 16:39.725
if he finds out
you're working elsewhere.

16:39.759 --> 16:41.093
You know that, don't you?

16:42.359 --> 16:43.792
Pete too. He'll kill you.

16:43.826 --> 16:45.159
I don't doubt it.

16:46.259 --> 16:47.892
It's the same yard, though,
bruv.

16:47.926 --> 16:49.293
Come around.

16:49.326 --> 16:51.293
I'll never hear
the end of it otherwise.

16:51.326 --> 16:53.725
Yeah. Well,
I ain't going anywhere.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.159
- Yeah.
- Tell him I'll come around.

16:56.193 --> 16:57.826
It's good seeing you, Seamus.

16:57.859 --> 16:59.860
Good to see you too, mate.

17:18.027 --> 17:21.060
I'll right,
as soon as you catch up, right?

17:21.094 --> 17:22.726
Respect's a thing.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.928
Stop being such a monumental
little pussy,

17:24.961 --> 17:26.794
take the job,
take the wedge,

17:26.828 --> 17:29.261
and then fuck off
away from them all.

17:29.295 --> 17:31.661
To Spain. New life.

17:31.694 --> 17:33.828
How many times.
I'm not ducking out on Daisy.

17:33.861 --> 17:36.761
- It's not ducking out.
- It ain't an option.

17:36.794 --> 17:40.028
Look, even if it is a job,
you're a professional.

17:40.061 --> 17:41.328
How hard can it be?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.828
It's different now.
I'm different.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.895
I'll do it, then.

17:47.929 --> 17:50.062
- I don't give a fuck.
- They don't even know you.

17:50.096 --> 17:52.029
Caddy don't even trust
his own mother.

17:52.062 --> 17:55.029
- You think he's gonna trust you?
- Don't mention my name, then.

17:55.062 --> 17:56.862
Take the job.

17:56.895 --> 17:58.296
You set everything up.

17:58.329 --> 17:59.895
I'll do the rest.

17:59.929 --> 18:02.129
I've got my hands dirty
for you before.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.628
Yeah, and look where
that got me.

18:04.662 --> 18:06.795
Oh, how many times
are you going to bring that up?

18:06.829 --> 18:09.062
I did everything you asked.

18:09.096 --> 18:10.862
Shh! Julia.

18:10.895 --> 18:13.629
No. No,
I'm just at work, actually.

18:15.729 --> 18:18.263
No, no, no, no.
I can get someone to cover.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.030
No.

18:20.063 --> 18:21.963
No, I won't be late.

18:23.063 --> 18:24.363
Thanks.

18:25.863 --> 18:27.197
Picking up Daisy?

18:28.430 --> 18:30.796
Well, you'd better
get a move on, then.

18:38.298 --> 18:39.697
Daddy!

18:39.730 --> 18:41.231
Hello, sweetheart.

18:45.398 --> 18:47.131
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

18:47.164 --> 18:49.164
My mom's out of town,
and everyone else is...

18:49.198 --> 18:51.264
Jules. Sorry, Julia.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.764
Julia, she's my daughter.
I'm glad you called.

18:53.797 --> 18:55.630
Have you started
smoking again?

18:55.664 --> 18:56.964
No.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.932
Hmm. Okay.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.199
Well, I'll meet you
at the café at 5:00, all right?

19:01.232 --> 19:03.898
- Here's some cash. Get some tea.
- It's okay, I've got it.

19:03.932 --> 19:06.232
Oh. Okay. Fine.

19:07.299 --> 19:09.165
Oh, I thought
you should know.

19:09.199 --> 19:11.232
She's in the nativity.
She's playing Gabriel.

19:11.265 --> 19:13.065
I'm sure she'll tell you
all about it.

19:13.099 --> 19:15.898
- You should come.
- Okay.

19:15.932 --> 19:17.598
Thanks.

19:22.099 --> 19:25.200
Put your backpack on.
Leave us a seat.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.033
You still doing food?

19:33.066 --> 19:34.366
You've got half an hour.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.632
Could I get a tea,
hot chocolate...

19:36.666 --> 19:38.666
- You got any fish fingers?
- Yeah, with chips.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.632
- Dad!
- Yeah, one second, honey.

19:40.666 --> 19:43.732
- Yes, please.
- Got pie and mash: £2.50.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.300
If you're hungry.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.799
Uh...

19:46.834 --> 19:49.167
Yeah, go on, then.

19:49.201 --> 19:51.000
Peas with your fish fingers?

19:51.034 --> 19:52.600
Daisy, do you want peas?

19:53.301 --> 19:55.900
Daisy, do you want pea...?

19:59.101 --> 20:00.000
No.

20:00.034 --> 20:01.834
6.50, then.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.367
Thanks.

20:08.934 --> 20:11.368
Now, why didn't you tell her
about cousin Ted?

20:12.868 --> 20:14.102
She's so cute.

20:14.135 --> 20:15.402
Look at that face.

20:15.435 --> 20:18.035
He's not really a cousin, honey.

20:18.068 --> 20:20.768
We just used to work
the same place together.

20:20.801 --> 20:23.734
Yeah, it was a proper
family business, Daisy.

20:23.768 --> 20:26.202
And you never turn your back
on family.

20:26.235 --> 20:27.668
Do you, Mark?

20:27.701 --> 20:29.601
Come here
and sign on properly.

20:32.135 --> 20:34.202
What the fuck
are you doing here?

20:34.235 --> 20:36.836
Just following orders.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.069
Remember them?

20:39.069 --> 20:40.769
Actually, some of the family

20:40.802 --> 20:43.269
will be at the restaurant
tonight, 9:00 p.m.

20:43.303 --> 20:45.269
They'd love to catch up.

20:45.303 --> 20:47.403
Especially this time of year.

20:47.436 --> 20:49.702
And Merry Christmas, Daisy.

20:49.735 --> 20:52.735
And I really hope
to see you again soon.

21:27.871 --> 21:28.871
Not good.

21:30.004 --> 21:31.305
Not good at all.

21:31.338 --> 21:33.038
Head Office won't let
this continue

21:33.071 --> 21:35.238
into the new year, Caddy.

21:35.271 --> 21:37.671
They'll get rid
of Southfields first,

21:37.704 --> 21:40.604
or maybe just hand it over.

21:43.071 --> 21:46.004
Sorry, could I ask you to put
the cigarette out, please?

21:47.339 --> 21:50.339
Can you just get me
my fucking usual, please?

21:50.372 --> 21:52.005
Thank you.

21:53.939 --> 21:56.039
Southfields. Nicky.

21:56.072 --> 21:58.939
You might have to get back out
there, get the punters back in.

21:58.972 --> 22:00.738
It's not the girls, Caddy.

22:00.772 --> 22:03.239
They're all in the Azzi's club?

22:03.272 --> 22:04.972
Must be.

22:05.005 --> 22:07.206
So, what's so fucking special
about their pussy?

22:08.306 --> 22:10.272
Punters like regulars.

22:10.306 --> 22:12.240
Junction's not looking
too clever, neither.

22:12.273 --> 22:13.940
That's because I hit
the coke drop.

22:13.973 --> 22:15.307
We know that.

22:16.207 --> 22:17.373
What we don't know is,

22:17.407 --> 22:19.973
someone's giving
them information.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.407
- Who?
- The local problem, Caddy.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.006
We've been through this.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.940
- I don't know.
- Your fucking job to know.

22:25.973 --> 22:28.906
I just look after the girls.

22:28.940 --> 22:29.840
Stop it.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.773
You're hurting me.

22:31.806 --> 22:33.207
Maybe I should.

22:34.140 --> 22:35.308
Don't be an asshole, Caddy.

22:37.374 --> 22:39.007
You know what I love
about you, Nicky?

22:39.041 --> 22:41.074
You're a bitch,
but you're an honest bitch.

22:41.108 --> 22:45.374
We know how important
to the organization Nicky is.

22:45.408 --> 22:47.774
Head Office are more concerned
with how unstable...

22:47.807 --> 22:48.974
Unstable?

22:50.408 --> 22:52.408
I think everyone needs
to remind themselves

22:52.441 --> 22:53.974
I brought stability.

22:54.007 --> 22:55.974
And it's been like that
for 30 years.

22:56.007 --> 23:00.309
Well, all good things
can come to an end, Caddy.

23:00.342 --> 23:02.175
So get your house
back in fucking order,

23:02.209 --> 23:03.309
before they do.

23:16.942 --> 23:19.741
If he says I sounded viable,
then we do this.

23:19.775 --> 23:21.142
It's only going to work
if you do

23:21.175 --> 23:22.709
exactly as I say
to the letter.

23:22.742 --> 23:23.943
No questions.

23:23.976 --> 23:25.343
I manage the whole job,

23:25.376 --> 23:27.076
oversee everything,
deal with everyone.

23:27.110 --> 23:28.276
You got that?

23:29.110 --> 23:31.176
You're only looking
after this.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.742
Nothing else.

23:32.776 --> 23:34.110
Okay?

23:35.676 --> 23:37.742
You know you can
trust me, Mark.

23:42.843 --> 23:45.709
Nicky looks cozy in that office,
don't she?

23:52.344 --> 23:54.010
Back in a minute.

24:22.811 --> 24:24.145
Done.

24:27.345 --> 24:29.278
Marky, come and see me,
sunshine.

24:29.312 --> 24:31.978
Let's see them gorgeous chops
of yours.

24:33.212 --> 24:35.146
Where you been, big box?

24:36.846 --> 24:38.313
Did you forget
where we were,

24:38.346 --> 24:42.179
or did you just forget
about us altogether?

24:42.213 --> 24:44.046
I don't know.

24:45.279 --> 24:47.379
I don't know.

24:47.413 --> 24:49.012
I don't know.

24:49.046 --> 24:51.346
Hmm. Ain't you gonna see
what Santa brought you?

24:54.745 --> 24:56.712
It's a bottle of smelly.
Ralph Lauren.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.913
That's what I used to wear,
if my memory serves me right.

25:00.947 --> 25:03.646
I bought you a bottle of that
after the first bank rob we did.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.414
Remember what I used
to say to you?

25:06.447 --> 25:09.980
You always got to smell good
in such a filthy business.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.147
Do you remember
that first job?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.813
Nah. I don't.

25:16.847 --> 25:19.247
I was 14.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.847
Back then you always had
a wise head on your shoulders.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.914
A lot smarter than
some of them old-timers.

25:23.948 --> 25:25.914
You didn't even have hair
on your bollocks.

25:27.148 --> 25:28.681
Kind words, Caddy.

25:28.714 --> 25:30.647
They were good days.

25:30.681 --> 25:32.747
Where the fuck did they go?

25:32.781 --> 25:36.115
I am getting pressure
from all angles, Mark.

25:36.148 --> 25:37.747
It doesn't sit well with me.

25:37.781 --> 25:40.014
It puts me off
my fucking ribs.

25:40.048 --> 25:41.981
Heavy's the head
that wears the crown.

25:42.014 --> 25:43.281
Well, I've worn it too long

25:43.315 --> 25:45.115
for them Azzis
to take it away from me.

25:45.148 --> 25:47.715
Azzis?

25:47.748 --> 25:48.915
That's your contract.

25:48.949 --> 25:50.282
Yeah.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.049
See, that's what I came
to talk about

25:52.082 --> 25:54.882
You still owe me
for that job.

25:54.915 --> 25:56.249
Four years weren't enough?

25:56.282 --> 25:58.216
Four years at
Her Majesty's pleasure.

25:58.249 --> 25:59.849
Not mine.

25:59.882 --> 26:01.782
It was the car that Pete sorted.
You know that.

26:01.815 --> 26:04.149
Yeah, yeah. If me aunt
had a cock, she'd be me uncle.

26:04.182 --> 26:09.149
- Pete was the one that sorted...
- I don't want to keep fucking going over this.

26:09.182 --> 26:11.083
Bad things have been
going on around here.

26:11.117 --> 26:13.816
And seeing you've been banged up
behind bars,

26:13.850 --> 26:15.916
I thought you was the one
I could trust.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.383
I can't do that anymore, Caddy.

26:18.417 --> 26:21.816
All I'm asking for
is bang, bang, bang, done.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.883
We're square. You can go
on my fucking blessing.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.816
Each of them wears
a signet ring.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.151
This is important.

26:35.184 --> 26:37.817
I want all three rings

26:37.851 --> 26:39.384
on a necklace

26:39.418 --> 26:41.017
around my throat,

26:41.051 --> 26:44.384
so everybody fucking knows
who's in charge.

26:44.418 --> 26:46.017
All three?

26:46.051 --> 26:47.284
Like I said.

26:47.318 --> 26:49.084
Bang, bang, bang.

26:49.118 --> 26:50.884
Should be easy for a man
of your abilities.

26:52.251 --> 26:54.051
And before you fucking
kill them,

26:54.084 --> 26:56.351
I want to find out
who's been helping them out.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.718
15K each.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.018
Five up front,

27:04.052 --> 27:06.685
the rest when
you finish the job.

27:06.718 --> 27:08.185
Marky...

27:10.718 --> 27:12.651
if my family goes down...

27:13.785 --> 27:15.119
it won't be the only one.

28:47.022 --> 28:50.189
Not interested, mate.
Got enough dishcloths, thanks.

28:50.223 --> 28:51.289
Come in.

28:51.323 --> 28:52.889
- Funny.
- Yeah.

28:52.922 --> 28:54.389
Very funny.

28:54.423 --> 28:56.356
Sit down, man.
You want a cup of tea?

28:56.389 --> 28:58.857
- Two or three sugars?
- Yeah. Just make sure...

28:58.890 --> 29:00.290
Yeah, I remember, stirring.

29:02.923 --> 29:04.357
Oy, oy.

29:05.424 --> 29:07.224
As I live and fucking breathe.

29:07.257 --> 29:08.890
My old wingman.

29:11.823 --> 29:13.157
I miss you, man.

29:14.790 --> 29:16.957
Look, you know, for a long time
I wanted to say...

29:16.990 --> 29:20.124
Pete, it's okay.
Time's done.

29:20.157 --> 29:21.756
You know I got
your back, right?

29:21.790 --> 29:23.358
Yeah, I should hope so.

29:23.391 --> 29:25.958
- Anything you need.
- Yeah, yeah, you want a tissue?

29:39.291 --> 29:41.791
It's changed a bit
around here.

29:41.824 --> 29:43.191
New business, Marky.

29:43.225 --> 29:44.991
- Yeah?
- Mm.

29:45.024 --> 29:47.159
Well, if having to walk
and then knock on your door

29:47.192 --> 29:49.192
ten times a day
means business.

29:49.226 --> 29:51.226
Yeah, we had to reshape
a few things

29:51.259 --> 29:54.658
after Caddy threw his toys
out the pram.

29:54.692 --> 29:56.192
Fat, paranoid fucker.

29:57.392 --> 29:59.059
Remember Big Rich?

29:59.092 --> 30:00.825
Big Dick the bouncer?

30:00.859 --> 30:04.259
Mm. So Caddy started getting
some next information,

30:04.292 --> 30:08.092
telling him Nicky's been fucking
someone else on the border.

30:08.126 --> 30:09.792
So he sends me
and Big Rich in.

30:10.793 --> 30:12.926
When we got here,
we decided it was a one-man job,

30:12.960 --> 30:14.793
so we flipped for it.

30:14.826 --> 30:16.726
I waited in the car
and kept dog.

30:16.759 --> 30:20.026
Rich must have decided he was
going to hide in the wardrobe,

30:20.060 --> 30:21.659
let them do their thing,

30:21.693 --> 30:23.659
then take them out after,
when they're asleep.

30:23.693 --> 30:25.793
Or maybe he was a pervert
and wanted to watch.

30:25.826 --> 30:27.293
I don't know.

30:27.327 --> 30:30.060
What I do know is he didn't
fucking kill him.

30:30.093 --> 30:32.826
Right? I'm sat there,
and I see her come running out,

30:32.860 --> 30:34.328
clutching on to her clothes
and bag,

30:34.361 --> 30:36.061
trying to get
her car keys out.

30:37.228 --> 30:39.027
So I run over to where
she's hysterical

30:39.061 --> 30:40.727
and not making any sense.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.727
I take her keys and put her
in back of my car,

30:42.760 --> 30:46.128
lock the door
and take her up to the flat.

30:46.161 --> 30:48.094
Big Rich is lying there

30:48.128 --> 30:50.128
with a wardrobe
over his broken neck.

30:50.161 --> 30:52.094
Dumb cunt's
done himself a wrong,

30:52.128 --> 30:53.694
and was too big
for the wardrobe

30:53.727 --> 30:55.128
when he's come out blazing.

30:55.161 --> 30:58.429
Fair dues, though.
Still hit the bloke.

30:58.462 --> 31:01.661
So, I follow the trail
into the bathroom.

31:02.928 --> 31:04.895
He's lying there.

31:06.262 --> 31:08.062
Just looking at me.

31:17.162 --> 31:18.995
Tea and binkies?

31:20.129 --> 31:21.828
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:23.796 --> 31:25.296
Here you are, Marky.

31:26.796 --> 31:28.196
Yes!

31:31.762 --> 31:35.263
So, what's Caddy's problem
with you, then?

31:35.296 --> 31:36.696
Ah.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.330
He calls me in the next morning,

31:38.363 --> 31:40.729
says Nicky's claiming I tried
to have my way with her.

31:40.762 --> 31:43.096
- Took the other two out myself.
- You what?

31:43.130 --> 31:45.163
- Proper slapper.
- Yeah, she just shifted the fact

31:45.196 --> 31:47.264
she's been fucking
someone else onto me.

31:48.763 --> 31:50.064
Got him around
her little finger.

31:50.097 --> 31:51.697
Got inside his paranoid head.

31:51.730 --> 31:53.964
Who's doing the work
if you and Rich ain't?

31:55.364 --> 31:56.964
- That little kid, Ted.
- Yeah.

31:56.997 --> 31:58.131
Horrible little fucker.

31:58.164 --> 31:59.864
Declining standards.

31:59.897 --> 32:01.697
He'd be happy you showed up.

32:08.164 --> 32:10.965
When there's a war going on,
you need good soldiers.

32:16.065 --> 32:18.031
Hello.

32:18.065 --> 32:20.365
I want you good boys
to tell me about these.

32:24.731 --> 32:26.332
Oh, mate, it's a fucking
suicide mission.

32:26.365 --> 32:28.198
Yeah, that's why
I need your help.

32:28.232 --> 32:30.165
Yeah.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.831
This guy, Sadit,

32:32.865 --> 32:34.765
he's a crazy bastard.

32:34.799 --> 32:36.832
Cut a partner's tongue out for
spitting on one of his girls.

32:36.866 --> 32:38.699
Well, that's the rumor, anyway.

32:38.732 --> 32:40.233
Yeah.

32:40.266 --> 32:42.799
You still got a link
with the chemist?

32:42.832 --> 32:45.799
What do you need?

32:45.832 --> 32:47.732
Cyanide would make my job
a hell of a lot easier.

32:50.199 --> 32:52.199
This is heavy, Marky.

32:53.199 --> 32:54.999
That's why I'm here.

32:56.133 --> 32:57.665
My name don't come up once.

32:57.699 --> 32:59.800
Not fucking once.
You hear?

33:01.467 --> 33:03.766
Of course not.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.167
What are you doing
for Christmas?

33:07.200 --> 33:08.933
No plans.

33:08.967 --> 33:10.167
Yeah?

33:10.200 --> 33:11.733
Then come for Christmas dinner.

33:11.766 --> 33:13.334
A little thing we do.
All the frills.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.134
Yeah, frills on the frills.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.967
I mean, that is, of course,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.234
if you want to spend time
with us outside of business.

33:19.267 --> 33:21.700
Well, that depends...

33:21.733 --> 33:24.001
on whether your turkey's
going to be succulent or not.

33:24.034 --> 33:26.268
Ooh!

33:27.868 --> 33:29.667
- Succulent?
- Yeah.

33:29.701 --> 33:31.667
You know,
moist and that.

33:33.301 --> 33:35.268
Yeah, I know what
succulent means, you pagan.

33:35.301 --> 33:36.968
Of course it's going
to be succulent.

33:37.001 --> 33:39.101
Well, I'd better bring
the cranberry sauce.

33:39.135 --> 33:40.667
Just in case.

33:44.868 --> 33:46.069
Praised Be.

33:46.102 --> 33:47.369
It was good seeing you, man.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.935
Later, Seamus.

33:48.969 --> 33:50.768
See you later, Marky.

33:51.835 --> 33:53.169
Have a good one.

33:54.236 --> 33:55.835
How are the spots doing?

33:55.869 --> 33:57.902
- Huh?
- Spots?

33:57.935 --> 33:59.269
Oh, shit.

34:21.735 --> 34:24.303
Make sure you wait
ten minutes.

34:24.337 --> 34:25.870
My wife's out there.

34:29.270 --> 34:31.070
But you did good.

34:32.936 --> 34:34.704
I'll let Sadit know.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.841
Fuck's sake!

36:13.208 --> 36:14.808
Shit!

36:44.709 --> 36:47.909
Yeah. She's got the biggest one
out of all of them.

36:49.976 --> 36:52.176
Stuffs it with diamonds
and jewels.

36:52.209 --> 36:54.443
Charles is the don
of Christmas pudding, though.

36:54.476 --> 36:56.042
- Pudding don?
- In this apron.

36:58.444 --> 36:59.810
Making custard.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.177
Pudding prince.

37:01.210 --> 37:02.910
Harry's on cranberry sauce.

37:02.943 --> 37:04.676
- What, fresh?
- No!

37:05.977 --> 37:07.344
Last minute,
from the garage.

37:07.377 --> 37:09.676
Only place that's open.

37:15.710 --> 37:17.344
- Who's this?
- It's me.

37:17.377 --> 37:18.810
Hello, sunshine.

37:18.843 --> 37:20.210
Thought you weren't
coming back.

37:20.244 --> 37:22.278
- I'm not.
- Are you calling me to tell me

37:22.311 --> 37:23.744
you're not calling anymore?

37:23.777 --> 37:25.145
I got a message for him.

37:25.178 --> 37:26.944
Well, that was nice and quick.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.978
Seems you aren't that rusty
after all.

37:29.011 --> 37:30.677
I never said I was.

37:30.711 --> 37:32.844
Of course not.
What's your message?

37:32.878 --> 37:34.211
Wimpy, 8:00 a.m.

37:34.245 --> 37:36.878
- Breakfast on you?
- Yeah.

37:36.911 --> 37:38.411
Of course it is.

37:38.445 --> 37:40.777
- Mark?
- Yeah?

37:40.811 --> 37:42.811
Welcome back.

37:46.412 --> 37:48.778
Now let me do all the talking.

37:48.812 --> 37:50.745
You just wait
for the order, yeah?

38:35.881 --> 38:37.680
What the fuck is this?

38:41.081 --> 38:44.981
Do you know who I am,
you fucking moron?

38:45.014 --> 38:46.847
Yes, Hassan.

38:46.881 --> 38:49.047
Question is,
do you know who I am?

38:49.081 --> 38:52.281
A dead man walking
when my brothers find you.

38:52.314 --> 38:54.680
Better than a dead man kneeling.

38:54.714 --> 38:56.214
They'll find you, you know.

38:56.248 --> 38:58.382
Wherever you run.

39:00.815 --> 39:02.781
Good.

39:02.815 --> 39:04.681
It saves me looking,
doesn't it?

39:06.482 --> 39:09.282
Listen, whatever they're
paying you,

39:09.315 --> 39:11.748
whoever they are,
yeah, we could double it.

39:11.781 --> 39:14.982
Unfortunately,
Caddy's offering

39:15.015 --> 39:17.182
something a bit more important
than money.

39:18.282 --> 39:20.015
Caddy.

39:20.048 --> 39:21.716
Shut it!

39:24.150 --> 39:26.916
He's a drunken old man.
Paranoid.

39:26.949 --> 39:28.949
Is that why you took
his coke?

39:28.983 --> 39:30.816
Business is booming.

39:30.849 --> 39:33.949
Why the fuck would we pull
some low-level shit like that?

39:33.983 --> 39:35.450
I swear.

39:35.483 --> 39:36.883
Caddy's losing it.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.316
Well, whatever he's paying,

39:38.350 --> 39:40.049
yeah, we'll triple it.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.749
- Why ain't you pulling?
- Hang on a minute.

39:41.782 --> 39:43.016
If they can triple it...

39:43.049 --> 39:44.450
Yeah, man.
Triple it, triple it.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.050
Bleeding Brutus.
Always just saying things.

39:47.084 --> 39:50.217
Now, somebody helped you
to try and kill Caddy. Who?

39:50.251 --> 39:53.017
- I'm not trying to kill anyone.
- You need to start talking.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.317
I need some information.

39:54.351 --> 39:56.050
Otherwise,
it's out of my control.

39:56.084 --> 39:58.451
I don't want to have
to hurt you, but...

39:58.484 --> 40:00.683
I'll prune you
like a fucking rosebush.

40:00.717 --> 40:03.750
It's just the littlest cuts
that yield the best results.

40:03.783 --> 40:06.050
Eyelids, fingers, tongue.

40:06.084 --> 40:07.750
Just snip, snip, snip.

40:07.783 --> 40:10.252
Okay! Okay! Okay!

40:10.285 --> 40:12.118
Sick bastard.

40:13.485 --> 40:15.085
Okay, okay.

40:16.285 --> 40:17.851
I know some guys.

40:17.885 --> 40:20.118
All right?
They came down to his club.

40:20.152 --> 40:23.252
Now, after the punters
come out...

40:25.018 --> 40:26.951
I followed him...

40:26.985 --> 40:28.818
beat him up,
told him to stay all clear.

40:28.851 --> 40:31.152
It's just a bit of friendly
business competition, yeah?

40:31.185 --> 40:33.252
It's nothing Caddy
hasn't done before, is it?

40:33.285 --> 40:34.852
Huh?

40:35.819 --> 40:37.186
Very good, Hassan.

40:38.219 --> 40:39.819
Gee, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

40:39.852 --> 40:42.086
Yeah. Yeah.

40:42.119 --> 40:43.685
Who took the coke?

40:43.719 --> 40:45.319
- What coke?
- Who took the fucking coke?

40:45.353 --> 40:47.353
I don't know, I swear!

40:47.386 --> 40:49.685
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:49.719 --> 40:52.052
Last chance.

40:52.086 --> 40:53.852
Please.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.020
No, no! Aah!

41:11.187 --> 41:13.120
Aah!

41:13.154 --> 41:15.953
Oh, you crazy motherfucker!

41:20.287 --> 41:21.854
I'll cut you a deal.

41:23.388 --> 41:25.288
Your life for one name.

41:25.321 --> 41:28.854
The person who tried
to kill Caddy, or his leak.

41:28.888 --> 41:31.954
Take me...
Take me to Sadit or Ola.

41:31.988 --> 41:34.221
- They could help.
- Hoping helped save their life,

41:34.255 --> 41:35.954
but who's going to help
save yours?

41:35.988 --> 41:37.388
I'll do anything.

41:37.421 --> 41:39.954
Give me a fucking name!

41:39.988 --> 41:41.954
It wasn't us.

41:41.988 --> 41:43.821
I don't know anything!

41:44.988 --> 41:46.788
Well...

41:46.822 --> 41:48.688
that's right.

41:48.722 --> 41:50.422
No, no, no, no.

42:00.289 --> 42:03.189
Some people want souvenirs.

42:03.222 --> 42:05.389
The hit-and-disposal method.

42:05.422 --> 42:07.156
That's why the van's good.

42:07.189 --> 42:09.289
Do a job...

42:09.322 --> 42:11.023
clear up the mess
at the end.

42:11.056 --> 42:12.457
The less people see,
the better.

42:12.490 --> 42:14.457
Like a dog poo bag.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.956
Take it with you,
dispose of it elsewhere.

42:17.990 --> 42:19.756
How... How much do you want?

42:19.789 --> 42:21.123
Name a price.

42:21.157 --> 42:24.890
It's the same old script.

42:24.923 --> 42:26.323
Same daytime show.

42:26.357 --> 42:28.923
We all know how it ends,
so why bother tuning in?

42:29.890 --> 42:31.756
I can get you a million.

42:31.789 --> 42:33.957
No questions asked.

42:33.991 --> 42:35.291
I guarantee your safety.

42:35.324 --> 42:36.924
Yeah.

42:36.957 --> 42:40.191
Oh... oh, no.

42:40.224 --> 42:41.424
You've got...

42:41.458 --> 42:43.991
You've got the wrong...

42:45.258 --> 42:48.857
Why don't you die
with some fucking dignity.

43:20.092 --> 43:22.893
Where you been?
My beans have been getting cold.

43:22.926 --> 43:24.993
Don't tell me I've been here
twiddling my thumbs

43:25.026 --> 43:26.926
and you've been here
shopping for shoes.

43:26.959 --> 43:29.193
I found a perfect gift for you.

43:29.226 --> 43:31.393
- Where?
- The sports club.

43:31.426 --> 43:33.226
- Alone?
- Yeah.

43:33.260 --> 43:34.993
How'd you know where he was?

43:35.026 --> 43:37.360
I done my homework.

43:43.959 --> 43:45.093
Who's this?

43:45.126 --> 43:48.227
The youngest one.
Hassan.

43:48.261 --> 43:50.194
But what is this?

43:50.227 --> 43:51.960
It's Hassan's hand.

43:51.994 --> 43:54.094
How the fuck am I supposed
to know without a ring?

43:54.127 --> 43:55.760
Who's this?

43:56.793 --> 43:58.927
This could be fucking anybody.

43:59.894 --> 44:01.194
Hang on.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.727
Is that the left one?

44:05.760 --> 44:07.960
I thought you said the left.
Look, the wedding ring.

44:07.994 --> 44:10.162
- I said the fucking signet ring.
- On the left.

44:10.195 --> 44:11.861
We were fucking sold
the signet ones.

44:11.895 --> 44:13.395
It's the signet
I fucking wanted.

44:13.428 --> 44:16.362
Why can't you identify him
from the wedding ring?

44:16.395 --> 44:18.928
What do you want to do?
Ask his wife? Check with her?

44:18.961 --> 44:20.861
"Is that Hassan's hand?"

44:20.895 --> 44:22.128
He's the right guy, trust me.

44:22.162 --> 44:23.694
Trust you? Fuck you.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.462
This is supposed to be
quick and clean.

44:25.495 --> 44:27.395
Okay, so we got a problem.

44:30.262 --> 44:32.095
What you got for me?

44:32.128 --> 44:34.862
He said he was intimidating
your punters, but no names.

44:34.896 --> 44:37.163
Just says Ola or Sadit
would know.

44:37.196 --> 44:40.729
So someone who is
possibly an Azzi

44:40.762 --> 44:44.229
has told you something
that I already fucking know.

44:46.029 --> 44:48.062
You'd better get that ring
back here sharpish,

44:48.096 --> 44:50.996
because me and you can't afford
a fuck out, Marky.

45:07.730 --> 45:09.264
Be honest.

45:09.297 --> 45:11.430
You think I'm just good
for the dirty work, right?

45:11.464 --> 45:13.330
Good? You got
the wrong hand, Alan.

45:13.364 --> 45:15.164
Not good, mate.
Not good at all.

45:17.430 --> 45:19.397
Hassan seemed to think
it was a setup.

45:19.430 --> 45:21.230
Yeah, of course he did.

45:24.331 --> 45:26.797
It would be quite convenient,
wouldn't we?

45:26.831 --> 45:28.731
You just come back and all.

45:28.764 --> 45:31.098
Let's not complicate things
any more than they already are.

45:31.131 --> 45:32.964
Let's just get
the job done properly.

45:41.465 --> 45:43.098
Excuse me?

45:43.131 --> 45:45.899
Did you know you're on
private land?

45:50.832 --> 45:52.299
What you digging there?

45:52.332 --> 45:54.166
Uh...

46:10.367 --> 46:12.866
There's always going to be
some breakage, Mark.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.400
You know that.

46:15.766 --> 46:17.200
We both know that.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.767
- What took you?
- Where's Caddy?

46:36.800 --> 46:38.234
Oh, nice.

46:38.268 --> 46:40.168
You drag me out of bed
at the crack of dawn,

46:40.201 --> 46:41.468
and that's the hello I get.

46:41.501 --> 46:43.301
Never had you down

46:43.334 --> 46:46.734
as someone who didn't know
his left from right, Marky.

46:47.901 --> 46:49.368
Just look in the box, Toni.

46:53.901 --> 46:56.800
Christ. You could have just
brought the ring.

46:56.834 --> 46:59.302
What am I supposed to do with
all these, put them on eBay?

46:59.335 --> 47:01.701
Well, there can't be
any question, now can there?

47:01.735 --> 47:03.369
Well, what did Hassan tell you?

47:03.402 --> 47:05.735
He said it wasn't them
that hit you.

47:05.768 --> 47:07.202
And after what
I put him through,

47:07.235 --> 47:09.335
if he knew anything,
he would have said it.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.935
- Who was it then?
- Doesn't know.

47:11.968 --> 47:13.968
Thinks Caddy's crazy.
Losing the plot.

47:14.002 --> 47:17.169
The less Caddy finds out,
the more he imagines he sees.

47:17.202 --> 47:20.002
You want to watch he doesn't
start looking at your mistakes

47:20.035 --> 47:21.736
like they're a plan against him.

47:21.769 --> 47:24.769
When he starts suspecting those,
it never ends well.

47:27.136 --> 47:28.969
Now...

47:29.003 --> 47:31.370
so we don't get off
on the wrong foot

47:31.403 --> 47:34.436
by getting the wrong
fucking hand again,

47:34.470 --> 47:36.903
go and get some sleep.

47:36.936 --> 47:39.270
You look like shit.

48:13.305 --> 48:14.871
Hey, wait, Jules.

48:17.071 --> 48:19.238
Who the fuck
is cousin Ted, Mark?

48:21.038 --> 48:23.105
- He's no one.
- Oh, well, he's someone,

48:23.138 --> 48:25.305
because Daisy's mentioned him
a few times already.

48:25.338 --> 48:27.272
He's just someone
I bumped into.

48:27.305 --> 48:29.704
- If you've gone back to...
- No, it's not like that.

48:29.738 --> 48:31.704
I can explain.

48:31.738 --> 48:33.071
Get in.

48:38.006 --> 48:39.939
I get home and find money
in an envelope.

48:39.972 --> 48:42.805
Where the hell
does it come from, Mark?

48:42.839 --> 48:45.306
I just wanted to give you
something before I left, Jules.

48:45.339 --> 48:47.206
I might not be coming back.

48:47.239 --> 48:48.906
What?

48:48.939 --> 48:51.373
What do you mean, back?
Might not be coming back?

48:51.406 --> 48:53.206
Mark, what the hell
does that mean?

48:54.206 --> 48:55.705
Daddy!

48:55.739 --> 48:57.039
Daisy.

48:57.073 --> 48:59.107
But I can't get to sleep.

48:59.140 --> 49:01.174
Daisy, listen to
your mom, honey.

49:01.207 --> 49:03.440
Can one of you come up
and read me a story?

49:03.474 --> 49:05.840
Yeah, I'll be up.
You go up now and I'll be up...

49:05.873 --> 49:07.907
No, I want Daddy to.

49:13.773 --> 49:18.706
"And when the little mouse found
the lion in the hunter's trap,

49:18.740 --> 49:22.408
he used his little sharp teeth
to gnaw through them.

49:24.008 --> 49:26.807
And so the great lion
was finally free."

49:43.874 --> 49:46.376
I know you're trying,
but you leave cash,

49:46.409 --> 49:49.075
and I don't know who's going
to come back looking for it.

49:49.109 --> 49:50.775
I worked hard for it.

49:50.808 --> 49:52.476
And sleeping in the van
doesn't cost, does it?

49:52.509 --> 49:55.109
It doesn't even look like
you've been sleeping at all.

49:56.342 --> 49:59.442
Look, hey,
it's for the best.

50:01.808 --> 50:03.476
I was going to give her
a present as well.

50:03.509 --> 50:06.842
If you want to give it to her,
come here on Christmas Day.

50:06.875 --> 50:08.875
It's better if I leave it here,
just in case.

50:08.909 --> 50:11.143
Just in case what, Mark?
I suppose this means

50:11.177 --> 50:13.943
you're not going to come
to the nativity after all.

50:13.976 --> 50:15.976
I suppose I have to break
that news to her.

50:16.010 --> 50:18.143
I forgot.

50:18.177 --> 50:21.010
Look, just send me
the details, yeah?

50:21.043 --> 50:23.177
Can you just take it for now?

50:23.210 --> 50:26.776
You either give it to her
in person or not at all.

50:26.809 --> 50:28.076
Your decision.

Okay, let's go.

And no man,

51:33.480 --> 51:36.180
when he hath lighted a lamp,
should cover it with a vessel

51:36.213 --> 51:37.879
or hide it under the bed,

51:37.913 --> 51:40.746
rather put it on a stand,

51:40.779 --> 51:42.779
that they that enter
may see the light.

51:59.813 --> 52:01.780
I've had Toni
on the phone, Mark.

52:01.813 --> 52:04.181
Yeah? Why's that?

52:04.214 --> 52:05.481
You tell me.

52:05.514 --> 52:08.047
I didn't mention you.
You're safe.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.115
Well, she's been asking about.

52:10.148 --> 52:12.382
Said things hadn't been smooth.

52:12.415 --> 52:13.781
Smooth?

52:13.814 --> 52:16.081
The job's going fine, thanks.

52:16.115 --> 52:18.781
Be careful, bruv.
They got their eye on you.

52:28.081 --> 52:30.315
What the fuck is this, bro?

52:30.348 --> 52:33.349
We spoke about a raise, right?
What is this?

52:33.383 --> 52:34.449
Hey, don't fuck...

52:34.483 --> 52:35.982
Get the fuck out of here, man.

52:36.016 --> 52:37.449
Don't fuck around with me,
you hear?

52:37.483 --> 52:39.449
Get the fuck out of my house!

52:49.283 --> 52:51.049
A bit easier
than the hit game.

52:51.082 --> 52:52.349
You think?

52:52.383 --> 52:54.116
At least you get to work
from home.

52:54.149 --> 52:56.149
They come to you,
but you still can't trust them.

52:56.183 --> 52:58.950
The stuff these days
is much stronger, Marky.

52:58.983 --> 53:00.716
- Yeah?
- Yes.

53:00.750 --> 53:02.816
Loads of different types
of green now.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.050
Moon Cheese, Amnesia,

53:05.083 --> 53:06.284
Euthanasia.

53:06.317 --> 53:07.816
Sounds heavy.

53:07.850 --> 53:09.484
Yeah, it is.
Trust me.

53:09.517 --> 53:13.284
Is that why you cover the flat
with perfume all the time?

53:13.317 --> 53:15.816
No, that's just Seamus Tindering
his way around South London.

53:18.217 --> 53:19.783
So, what about my stuff?

53:24.918 --> 53:27.385
Wouldn't advise putting it
behind your ears.

53:58.186 --> 54:01.019
It's only a matter of time
before they look for Hassan.

54:01.052 --> 54:04.119
Is that how you use it?

54:04.152 --> 54:06.985
You spray it, inject it,
put it in your food.

54:07.019 --> 54:08.986
We'll get this in easier
than a burger.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.320
I fucking love it.

54:10.353 --> 54:12.487
This is fucking great.

54:12.520 --> 54:15.753
I'll have a couple of dances,
look for Sadit.

54:15.786 --> 54:18.187
You see him go to the toilet,
you follow.

54:18.220 --> 54:19.453
One spray.

54:19.487 --> 54:21.853
- One spray?
- That's all we need.

54:21.886 --> 54:23.853
Remember to wear the mask.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.053
And if they frisk you
and ask any questions,

54:26.086 --> 54:28.453
you're just a painter
and decorator.

54:28.487 --> 54:30.686
And don't forget the ring.

54:33.521 --> 54:35.054
Look, it's Ola.

54:35.087 --> 54:36.720
Yeah.

54:36.754 --> 54:39.087
Let's get him
while we got the chance.

54:53.054 --> 54:55.454
Hey. Sorry to
disturb you, but...

54:55.488 --> 54:56.888
Sorry, what's your name?

54:56.922 --> 54:58.222
- Jenny.
- Jenny. Perfect.

54:58.255 --> 54:59.855
I'm from building maintenance.

54:59.888 --> 55:01.489
I've just come to check
your smoke alarms

55:01.522 --> 55:02.955
and the vents in the kitchen.

55:02.988 --> 55:04.389
It won't take a sec.

55:04.422 --> 55:06.155
You want to check my vents?

55:07.955 --> 55:09.322
Who is it?

55:09.355 --> 55:11.289
It's building maintenance.

55:11.322 --> 55:13.155
Well, tell them to fuck off!

55:13.189 --> 55:14.988
Oh, sorry.

55:15.022 --> 55:17.189
You're going to have to inspect
my vents another time.

55:17.222 --> 55:19.888
That's okay. Do you mind
just signing this for me.

55:19.922 --> 55:22.456
Just to, you know,
say that I knocked on, and...

55:23.889 --> 55:26.822
Stay the fuck quiet,
or you die.

55:34.423 --> 55:36.956
- Ola in there?
- Yeah.

55:39.089 --> 55:41.023
Don't say a fucking word.

55:44.890 --> 55:46.224
How many?

55:48.057 --> 55:49.690
Ola plus two?

55:58.324 --> 56:00.790
I'm here for Ola.

56:00.823 --> 56:04.857
But everyone dies
unless you cooperate.

56:05.757 --> 56:07.324
You understand?

56:08.257 --> 56:10.125
Don't make a fucking squeak.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.791
I'll be there, I promise.

56:31.225 --> 56:34.226
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

56:34.259 --> 56:36.092
Put my name down.

56:37.126 --> 56:38.359
Yeah.

56:38.393 --> 56:40.092
Great.

56:40.126 --> 56:42.026
No, of course not.

56:42.059 --> 56:43.859
Okay.

56:43.892 --> 56:45.825
All right, text me.

56:45.859 --> 56:47.126
Yes.

56:47.159 --> 56:48.725
Talk later.

56:50.992 --> 56:52.193
So?

56:57.127 --> 56:58.993
What did he say?

56:59.027 --> 57:00.726
Well, he wasn't that chatty.

57:08.294 --> 57:09.494
So you just shot him?

57:09.527 --> 57:11.060
Yeah.

57:12.260 --> 57:14.127
So you didn't get anything?

57:14.160 --> 57:15.360
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

57:15.394 --> 57:17.360
- Don't shoot!
- So...

57:17.394 --> 57:18.960
It ain't what it looks like.

57:18.993 --> 57:21.861
We're all innocent,
eh, Nicky?

57:21.894 --> 57:23.395
Every fucker's innocent.

57:23.428 --> 57:26.428
He's blackmailing me.
To run the clubs.

57:26.461 --> 57:28.727
Blackmailing you with what?

57:28.761 --> 57:30.428
I haven't always be
faithful to Caddy.

57:30.461 --> 57:31.794
No shit.

57:33.128 --> 57:34.694
You want to end up
like your mate.

57:35.761 --> 57:37.761
I told him
about the coke drops.

57:41.861 --> 57:44.328
Gifts aplenty, Mark.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.329
Getting quite good at this now.

57:49.496 --> 57:51.496
Let's go back and get Sadit.

58:13.363 --> 58:14.930
When Sadit finally turns up,

58:14.963 --> 58:17.263
I'm going to spray the shit
out of him.

58:18.430 --> 58:20.963
For fuck's sake.

58:20.996 --> 58:22.896
You need to be focused
on this job,

58:22.930 --> 58:25.230
not flirting with your
fucking ex who can't stand you.

58:25.263 --> 58:27.430
- What's your problem?
- You not fully focused,

58:27.463 --> 58:28.930
is my fucking problem.

58:28.963 --> 58:30.330
You're going to get us
all killed.

58:30.363 --> 58:32.197
- Focus.
- What are you talking about?

58:32.230 --> 58:34.298
Your head's in two
fucking places.

58:34.331 --> 58:36.498
Fuck's sake.

58:36.531 --> 58:39.231
Shit. Go, go, man.

58:43.498 --> 58:45.398
All right, been here long?

58:45.431 --> 58:47.897
Uh, no. Not long, no.

58:47.931 --> 58:49.331
All right.

58:49.364 --> 58:51.298
Just had a report
of a break-in, you see.

58:51.331 --> 58:52.997
Well, I ain't seen anything.

58:53.031 --> 58:54.764
- You working around here?
- Yeah.

58:54.797 --> 58:56.499
Just painting the house
around the corner.

58:56.532 --> 58:58.132
Well, they're probably
long gone,

58:58.165 --> 59:00.132
but if you do
see anything suspicious,

59:00.165 --> 59:02.365
- then please let us know.
- Yeah, will do.

59:07.365 --> 59:09.932
This is a 2004 Ford Transit 260.

59:09.965 --> 59:11.299
Short wheel base.

59:11.332 --> 59:12.932
Yeah.

59:16.232 --> 59:18.199
Thought so, yeah.

59:18.232 --> 59:20.098
I traveled around Germany
in one of these.

59:20.132 --> 59:22.233
2006 World Cup.
It was brilliant.

59:22.266 --> 59:23.966
Didn't we go out in penalties?

59:23.999 --> 59:25.799
Yeah, more about
the road trip, really.

59:25.832 --> 59:27.233
Went everywhere.

59:27.266 --> 59:30.166
Kaiserslautern,
Münsterland, Frankfurt.

59:30.200 --> 59:32.166
- Yeah, all around Germany.
- Yeah. Great times.

59:32.200 --> 59:33.466
Yeah, solid as you like,
aren't they, these?

59:37.400 --> 59:39.099
Anyway, sorry to be a stickler,

59:39.133 --> 59:41.066
but this is actually
a resident parking zone.

59:41.099 --> 59:43.899
Yeah, two old blokes
had a bit of a dispute,

59:43.933 --> 59:46.434
and now council are making
everyone pay, so...

59:51.800 --> 59:54.800
- Dog back there or something?
- No, there's nothing back there.

59:54.833 --> 59:57.401
Oh, it's some special paints.

59:57.434 --> 59:59.100
They can pop when mixed.
No worries.

59:59.134 --> 01:00:01.401
Yeah. See, you can't have
a dog back there, see?

01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:04.000
No, if I had a dog
it'd be up here with me, mate.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.767
Honestly, it's the chemicals
that can pop.

01:00:09.368 --> 01:00:11.834
I am going to have to have
a look in the back of the van.

01:00:11.868 --> 01:00:13.035
Sure.

01:00:18.068 --> 01:00:20.468
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, you're all right.

01:00:20.502 --> 01:00:21.834
Come on.

01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:28.235
Alan. Alan.

01:00:28.268 --> 01:00:29.834
What have you done, mate?

01:00:29.868 --> 01:00:31.834
Oh, just drive the fucking van.

01:00:31.868 --> 01:00:32.869
Fuck!

01:00:37.036 --> 01:00:39.236
You're not happy, Mark, mate?

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.236
Fuck's sake. Fuck.

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:43.436
Killed Ola, got the ring.

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:46.436
Even found out who the leak was.
I think they call that...

01:00:46.469 --> 01:00:48.503
Well, I don't think
there's a word for it,

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.036
but it's fucking good, yeah?

01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:51.503
It's a good result,
is what it is.

01:00:51.536 --> 01:00:54.002
Have you forgot
what we talked about?

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.903
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.470
Fuck!

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.770
Fuck.

01:01:15.803 --> 01:01:17.304
You need to calm
the fuck down.

01:01:17.337 --> 01:01:19.970
I can only keep her safe
if I know everything.

01:01:20.003 --> 01:01:22.305
Oh, don't make out
like you were in the dark.

01:01:22.338 --> 01:01:24.071
You know exactly
what happened there,

01:01:24.104 --> 01:01:26.238
or did you forget?

01:01:28.904 --> 01:01:31.904
Now, this is exactly
what Caddy wants.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.505
We're just ticking things
off the list, mate.

01:01:34.538 --> 01:01:36.771
And this one is just
a Christmas bonus.

01:01:36.804 --> 01:01:39.271
And you think they're going
to believe us and not her?

01:01:39.305 --> 01:01:41.138
I didn't sign up to this.

01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:42.871
There's supposed to be
three brothers,

01:01:42.904 --> 01:01:44.439
and not policemen
and lovers.

01:01:44.472 --> 01:01:46.206
You're going to
get us killed, mate.

01:01:46.239 --> 01:01:49.005
Perhaps you should start
doing the dirty work then.

01:02:08.407 --> 01:02:09.906
Fuck.

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.440
What are you banging
on the door for?

01:02:11.473 --> 01:02:13.340
I just need you
to hide something.

01:02:13.373 --> 01:02:14.940
- Say what?
- A girl.

01:02:14.973 --> 01:02:16.440
A girl?

01:02:16.473 --> 01:02:18.973
What are you up to, Marky?
You dog.

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:22.006
Just for a night.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.407
What...

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.873
- Who is it?
- Please, Seamus.

01:02:25.906 --> 01:02:27.440
Look, man, I'd like to help.

01:02:27.473 --> 01:02:29.273
No, no, no.
Mark, I want to help, but...

01:02:29.307 --> 01:02:31.507
- Oh, fuck's sake, Mark.
- Come on, help me with it.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.408
Jeez, he's not going
to be happy, man.

01:02:33.441 --> 01:02:34.907
I mean, who is she?

01:02:34.941 --> 01:02:36.408
The less you know, right?

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.840
You must be stupid or nuts
if you think...

01:02:38.874 --> 01:02:40.740
Look, I know it's a bit,
but I can sort it.

01:02:40.774 --> 01:02:42.408
Just, she just needs to stay
for one day,

01:02:42.441 --> 01:02:43.907
'cause I got
the cop in the van.

01:02:43.941 --> 01:02:45.941
- You what?
- It was an accident.

01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:47.374
Sort of.
It wasn't meant to happen.

01:02:47.408 --> 01:02:49.341
- You killed a copper?
- No. My partner did.

01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:52.474
Your partner?
What is he, crazy?

01:02:52.508 --> 01:02:54.308
I don't know anymore,
to be honest.

01:02:54.341 --> 01:02:56.208
Pete's gonna kill me for letting
you bring this in here.

01:02:57.509 --> 01:02:59.409
- Yes, Marky...
- Shh!

01:03:00.775 --> 01:03:02.942
What the fuck's going on?

01:03:02.975 --> 01:03:04.509
- Who the fuck is this?
- I told him.

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:06.775
- No, no. Shut up.
- Look, it's just for one night.

01:03:06.808 --> 01:03:08.808
- That's all, mate.
- She's alive.

01:03:08.841 --> 01:03:10.075
What?

01:03:10.108 --> 01:03:11.908
She's alive in the bin.

01:03:14.975 --> 01:03:18.375
- For one night, that's all.
- At least not the copper, right?

01:03:18.409 --> 01:03:20.008
What?

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:21.476
You kidnapped a policeman?

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:23.443
No. Dead.
His partner killed him.

01:03:23.476 --> 01:03:25.410
- Listen, man...
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:25.443 --> 01:03:28.343
She was there when he killed
Ola, my partner...

01:03:28.376 --> 01:03:30.376
This partner's going
to get you killed, bruv.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.176
You're my mate,
but this shit costs.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.876
You know how it goes.

01:03:33.909 --> 01:03:35.276
The only money I've got
is for my daughter, Pete.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.276
Yeah, well, then get her
to look after it, yeah?

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.176
- Go on, get out.
- Okay, okay.

01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:40.776
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:03:40.809 --> 01:03:44.143
Yeah. Bring me five grand
for my troubles.

01:03:58.444 --> 01:04:01.144
Bloody hell.
That thing's loud.

01:04:01.177 --> 01:04:04.077
You know, a lot of guys
are using Prius these days.

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.077
Run on electric,
so you can roll up on a man

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:07.511
and they barely hear you.

01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:10.078
Before bang,
you blast them with a shotgun

01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:11.278
and away you go.

01:04:11.312 --> 01:04:13.245
Saving the planet
at the same time.

01:04:13.278 --> 01:04:14.978
I could do with
one of those, actually.

01:04:15.011 --> 01:04:16.478
- What, a shotgun?
- No.

01:04:16.512 --> 01:04:18.878
- I've got one for 500 quid.
- No, it's okay.

01:04:18.911 --> 01:04:20.478
Okay, 400 for you, my boy.

01:04:20.512 --> 01:04:22.445
Toni, I mean a Prius.

01:04:22.478 --> 01:04:24.512
I need some wheels,
just for a night.

01:04:24.545 --> 01:04:26.945
Oh, okay. Suit yourself.

01:04:26.978 --> 01:04:28.778
It's a good shotgun, though.

01:04:28.811 --> 01:04:30.312
Blast a guy's head clean off.

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:32.346
I don't doubt it.

01:04:32.379 --> 01:04:34.379
Where's Caddy?

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:37.246
Why?

01:04:37.279 --> 01:04:39.012
There's a bit of trouble, Toni.

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:42.112
- Load in the back?
- Yeah.

01:04:42.146 --> 01:04:43.712
And not the sort you wanted.

01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:56.414
I see. Okay.

01:04:56.447 --> 01:05:00.314
Ted, sort this scrap
in the back shop, Ted.

01:05:01.913 --> 01:05:03.980
I know it's bad breakage,
Toni, but...

01:05:04.013 --> 01:05:06.314
This puts me in a very
unhealthy situation, Mark.

01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:09.280
I just need a couple of hours
and then I can sort this out.

01:05:09.314 --> 01:05:12.980
Okay. Okay, let me see
what I can do, all right?

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.813
Yeah, Roxy?

01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:21.515
Toni.

01:05:21.548 --> 01:05:24.081
You still got that Polo?

01:05:29.348 --> 01:05:30.881
Yeah?

01:05:33.948 --> 01:05:35.248
Okay, yeah.

01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:37.415
I'll call you
when he's on his way.

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:43.415
Sorted.

01:05:43.448 --> 01:05:46.282
Wonderful. I needed this.

01:05:46.316 --> 01:05:49.416
I just wanted
Daisy and Jules secure.

01:05:49.449 --> 01:05:51.216
You know?

01:05:51.249 --> 01:05:53.282
Safe. Looked after.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.848
What's she like?

01:05:55.882 --> 01:05:57.216
Daisy?

01:05:57.248 --> 01:05:59.915
Never known anything
so pure, Toni.

01:06:00.815 --> 01:06:02.082
She's an angel.

01:06:03.482 --> 01:06:05.915
You'll get to spoil her
when this is all wrapped up.

01:06:05.949 --> 01:06:08.749
Not long now.

01:06:08.783 --> 01:06:10.083
I'd die a happy man if I knew

01:06:10.116 --> 01:06:11.916
she was going
to be all right.

01:06:26.317 --> 01:06:27.849
I'm sorry, Mark.

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:29.483
There's only so much
I can do for you.

01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:48.051
Long time, Marky.

01:06:48.084 --> 01:06:50.418
Dave. Sam.

01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:53.184
Looking well, Boj.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.451
Cheers, Marky.
Been doing some spin classes.

01:06:57.118 --> 01:06:59.319
I like the pad, Marky.

01:07:00.985 --> 01:07:03.485
I see you brought your toys
with you from the loony bin.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.385
In case the van
breaks down, Caddy.

01:07:16.085 --> 01:07:17.985
You've done better
than I thought, Marky.

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:19.751
Yeah?

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.520
I didn't think
you'd be up for it.

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:23.819
You still sent me anyway.

01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:25.786
You got Toni to thank for that.

01:07:25.819 --> 01:07:27.786
So who's this partner
I'm hearing about?

01:07:27.819 --> 01:07:30.119
You don't know him.
It's just someone I met inside.

01:07:30.153 --> 01:07:31.752
Has he got a name?

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:33.086
Alan.

01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.919
And where's Alan?

01:07:34.953 --> 01:07:36.786
He's gone.

01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:38.852
Gone where?

01:07:38.886 --> 01:07:39.886
I don't know.

01:07:51.254 --> 01:07:53.521
Just let me finish the job.

01:07:53.554 --> 01:07:56.087
Let you keep fucking it up?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.020
Tell me,

01:07:58.054 --> 01:08:00.887
when did killing people
become so fucking hard, Marky?

01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:06.454
Do you know who the biggest
gang in London are?

01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:09.388
Not us. Not the Azzis.

01:08:09.422 --> 01:08:11.120
Not even Head Office.

01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:14.888
It's the Metropolitan
fucking Police, Marky.

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:17.354
And now one of their little
fucking piggies gone AWOL,

01:08:17.388 --> 01:08:20.055
do you think they'll be
shaking down?

01:08:20.087 --> 01:08:23.322
And you brought him here
to my fucking garage!

01:08:25.921 --> 01:08:27.888
I brought you onboard
to make my life easier.

01:08:27.921 --> 01:08:29.854
You don't know your fucking
left from your right.

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:30.854
You don't know your ass
from your elbow.

01:08:30.888 --> 01:08:34.055
- You're a fucking joke, Mark.
- I can fix it.

01:08:34.089 --> 01:08:37.956
I don't think so, mate.
No more last chances.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.854
Shit-dick Azzi's
gone underground.

01:08:39.889 --> 01:08:42.256
You are staying with us
till he pops his head up again.

01:08:42.288 --> 01:08:43.488
In the meantime,
you might remember

01:08:43.523 --> 01:08:45.389
where you dropped
your partner off.

01:08:45.423 --> 01:08:47.022
Get him out of my sight.

01:09:25.491 --> 01:09:27.358
Go, Rosie! Go, Rosie!

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:30.390
Go, Rosie!
I love you, Rosie.

01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:40.991
Ha, ha, ha.

01:09:41.024 --> 01:09:42.924
Yay! Yay!

01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:45.992
Rosie!

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:02.025
Always knew
they'd cut their losses

01:10:02.059 --> 01:10:03.792
once they'd used you.

01:10:17.527 --> 01:10:19.293
I knew you'd be trouble.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.893
Had to show your face,
didn't you?

01:10:22.926 --> 01:10:24.460
You stay away.

01:10:24.493 --> 01:10:27.327
You wanted to have your cake
and eat it, as usual.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.726
You had to fuck it up,
didn't you?

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:34.027
It was always going
to end in tears, Mark.

01:10:34.061 --> 01:10:35.894
You knew that,
same way I did.

01:10:37.027 --> 01:10:38.794
I'd have done a job like this
back in the day

01:10:38.827 --> 01:10:40.194
with my eyes closed.

01:10:40.228 --> 01:10:43.094
I didn't need you.
I didn't need anybody.

01:10:43.127 --> 01:10:46.328
Oh, but you did need me,
obviously.

01:10:46.361 --> 01:10:47.961
Because here I am.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.028
No more running, Mark.

01:10:58.495 --> 01:11:02.095
And what exactly
am I running from?

01:11:02.128 --> 01:11:03.962
The truth.

01:11:03.995 --> 01:11:06.795
Don't pretend like you don't
know what I'm talking about.

01:11:08.195 --> 01:11:09.362
What's going on?

01:11:10.529 --> 01:11:13.462
Open yourself up
to the truth, Mark.

01:11:15.295 --> 01:11:18.861
You'll feel 12 stone lighter.

01:11:31.396 --> 01:11:34.029
You can't control
everything, Mark.

01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:36.396
Life's just not like that.

01:11:38.063 --> 01:11:40.463
It's like the room
we first met in, right?

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:41.330
Who are you?

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:43.797
Ha, ha, you know who I am, Mark.

01:11:45.264 --> 01:11:46.897
Don't play that game with me.

01:11:48.297 --> 01:11:52.064
You are not me.

01:11:53.564 --> 01:11:55.064
Correct.

01:11:55.964 --> 01:11:58.431
You are me.

01:11:59.464 --> 01:12:02.197
Very, very different.

01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:09.332
But you got me
way fucking wrong

01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:11.365
if you think I'm going
to stand here

01:12:11.398 --> 01:12:12.998
and watch you
give up on us.

01:12:14.498 --> 01:12:16.031
I got a daughter.

01:12:18.864 --> 01:12:20.432
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

01:12:22.265 --> 01:12:24.198
You can't be around me.

01:12:24.232 --> 01:12:28.031
That's why I've been telling you
to go to Spain.

01:12:28.065 --> 01:12:31.365
See us straight
and get away from it all.

01:12:32.366 --> 01:12:34.132
Safer for her.

01:12:34.166 --> 01:12:35.433
For you.

01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:37.299
For everyone.

01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:02.400
Oy!

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.400
Oy!

01:13:07.434 --> 01:13:09.234
What do you want, Marky?

01:13:09.267 --> 01:13:12.534
I need a fucking toilet, mate.

01:13:12.567 --> 01:13:14.967
Isn't there a bottle
or something in there?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.766
I need a toilet!

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.400
I need a fucking toilet!

01:13:21.568 --> 01:13:23.468
All right!

01:13:23.501 --> 01:13:26.435
Don't do anything stupid...

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.368
or I'm shooting you
in the bollocks, okay?

01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:38.168
Aah! Aah!

01:13:41.401 --> 01:13:43.235
Stay the fuck down!

01:13:44.502 --> 01:13:45.469
You know what?

01:13:52.135 --> 01:13:55.369
I ain't got a problem with you.
I just want my money.

01:13:55.402 --> 01:13:57.236
So stay the fuck down, okay?

01:13:57.269 --> 01:14:01.402
And you think Caddy will be fine
with me letting you do that?

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.469
For brownie points.

01:14:02.502 --> 01:14:04.536
Oh! Jesus!

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:06.269
Oh, my leg!

01:14:06.302 --> 01:14:08.470
Marky, you wanker!

01:14:08.503 --> 01:14:10.070
Oh!

01:14:10.103 --> 01:14:11.803
You bastard!

01:14:49.404 --> 01:14:51.204
I heard you was out.

01:14:52.504 --> 01:14:54.004
How are you doing, Mark?

01:14:56.339 --> 01:14:57.339
Little Dick.

01:14:58.305 --> 01:14:59.272
Richard.

01:15:00.305 --> 01:15:02.205
Big Rich's son?

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.938
Oh, yeah. Richard.

01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:07.905
You're grown up,
ain't you? Hey?

01:15:07.938 --> 01:15:09.539
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:12.105
He was always
straight with me. Decent.

01:15:12.138 --> 01:15:14.305
Thanks, Mark.

01:15:14.339 --> 01:15:16.105
- Is Caddy about?
- Yeah.

01:15:16.138 --> 01:15:17.805
Gone up.

01:15:20.273 --> 01:15:22.206
Here you go.
Buy yourself some fags.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.139
Disappear for ten minutes, eh?

01:15:25.173 --> 01:15:26.739
Go on.

01:16:09.408 --> 01:16:10.874
I borrowed this, Toni.

01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:12.741
I hope you don't mind.

01:16:13.808 --> 01:16:15.408
He's like a fucking bad smell.

01:16:16.308 --> 01:16:17.841
Hands up.

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.774
Get up. Now.

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.208
Over there.

01:16:23.242 --> 01:16:24.874
Facing me.

01:16:38.276 --> 01:16:39.875
Don't mind?

01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:49.875
What's the code?

01:16:49.909 --> 01:16:51.243
What?

01:16:52.276 --> 01:16:54.409
- What's the code?
- What code?

01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:56.843
I'm way past the point

01:16:56.876 --> 01:16:58.444
of worrying about
pulling this trigger.

01:16:58.477 --> 01:17:00.310
Give me the fucking code.

01:17:04.177 --> 01:17:05.977
Only 66.

01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:24.811
This is my money, Caddy.

01:17:24.844 --> 01:17:26.545
Because I'm going
to finish the job.

01:17:26.578 --> 01:17:28.144
And then we'll be all square.

01:17:28.178 --> 01:17:29.811
I'm going to do exactly
what you asked,

01:17:29.844 --> 01:17:32.777
which means
Jules and Daisy stay safe.

01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:34.144
I promised.

01:17:35.445 --> 01:17:36.811
Sure.

01:17:36.844 --> 01:17:39.011
That's if you can find Sadit.

01:17:40.111 --> 01:17:41.678
Don't worry about that.

01:17:45.546 --> 01:17:47.446
He's going to find me.

01:18:02.079 --> 01:18:03.446
Hey, Santa's arrived.

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.512
Oh, what happened to you?

01:18:07.813 --> 01:18:09.946
- Don't want to talk about it?
- No.

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.347
Hiding any more girls in here?
What's that?

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.146
Bloody hell, Mark.

01:18:16.513 --> 01:18:18.013
This isn't that dodgy old thing

01:18:18.046 --> 01:18:19.513
Toni's always trying
to sell, is it?

01:18:19.547 --> 01:18:21.447
- Just let me, Seamus.
- What else you got?

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.913
What's in there?

01:18:23.946 --> 01:18:25.779
Wow, now that really
is dangerous.

01:18:25.813 --> 01:18:27.946
Kill a dinner in an instant.
You can keep that.

01:18:34.281 --> 01:18:35.981
Hey, look who's turned up.

01:18:36.014 --> 01:18:38.114
- And look what he's brought.
- Bro.

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:41.847
The turkey's already dead,
you know, Marky.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.248
Hope you're hungry.

01:18:44.513 --> 01:18:46.448
We've got a feast here
could feed 5,000.

01:18:46.481 --> 01:18:48.914
I'm hungry, yeah.

01:18:48.947 --> 01:18:50.181
Nice one.

01:18:50.214 --> 01:18:52.381
Ha! Joker.

01:18:52.414 --> 01:18:54.248
Wasn't expecting you just yet.

01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:56.249
Where is she?

01:18:58.349 --> 01:19:00.182
Bedroom.

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:22.550
Oh!

01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:24.550
Equal now, ain't we?

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:26.483
Just in time, Marky.

01:19:26.516 --> 01:19:28.016
I was about to dish up.

01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:30.483
What's going on?

01:19:32.483 --> 01:19:35.250
Well, you know,
smart as you think you are,

01:19:35.283 --> 01:19:37.383
you were followed here
by one of Sadit's lot.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:39.149
We had no choice.

01:19:39.183 --> 01:19:41.717
Could have got us all
fucking killed, you know.

01:19:44.317 --> 01:19:46.284
This looks cozy, Nicky.

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.351
Regular thing, is it?

01:19:51.384 --> 01:19:53.384
So many questions, eh, Marky?

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:54.484
What is the answer?

01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:58.451
We're making our money
under Caddy.

01:19:58.484 --> 01:20:00.850
You blame me for Big Rich.

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:03.084
Took me off a gig
I worked 20 years loyal.

01:20:03.117 --> 01:20:05.084
Started treating me
like a maggot.

01:20:05.117 --> 01:20:08.318
Making all sorts of accusations
about me and Nicky.

01:20:08.352 --> 01:20:09.985
It hurt, Marky.

01:20:11.385 --> 01:20:13.985
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

01:20:16.218 --> 01:20:18.884
I thought it was Nicky
making the accusations.

01:20:20.051 --> 01:20:21.252
You know what I mean.

01:20:21.285 --> 01:20:22.818
Pass the sprouts, Seamus.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:24.085
Hmm, really?

01:20:24.118 --> 01:20:25.518
Tastes like dog farts.

01:20:25.552 --> 01:20:27.018
Don't you like dog farts?

01:20:27.051 --> 01:20:28.552
That's funny.

01:20:28.585 --> 01:20:32.253
Caddy only gave a fuck about his
clubs and his girls.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:35.119
I saw an opportunity.

01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:36.553
To kill him?

01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:38.152
To make money.

01:20:38.186 --> 01:20:39.519
That's what this is, bruv.

01:20:39.553 --> 01:20:42.553
We just trying to make our way.

01:20:42.586 --> 01:20:44.119
A partnership with the Azzis?

01:20:44.152 --> 01:20:46.386
So it was you who stole
Caddy's coke.

01:20:46.419 --> 01:20:48.386
Very clever, Marky.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:51.785
Coke, crack, weed.
Whatever.

01:20:51.819 --> 01:20:55.554
Doesn't discriminate.
Doesn't pick a side.

01:20:55.587 --> 01:20:57.420
They thought we were involved
in the Ola hit.

01:20:57.454 --> 01:20:59.886
So we told them about you.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.020
Took a lot to
convince them, Marky.

01:21:02.053 --> 01:21:04.420
Hell of a lot.

01:21:04.454 --> 01:21:06.354
We promised Sadit a gift today.

01:21:06.387 --> 01:21:08.087
He's on his way to collect.

01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:31.821
Didn't think my turkey would be
so succulent, did you, Marky?

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:35.555
- Here.
- No.

01:21:35.588 --> 01:21:37.288
- Have you even tried it?
- No, fuck that.

01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:39.321
I don't want
jam on my meat, thanks.

01:21:39.355 --> 01:21:41.854
God, you're fussy.
You like anything on this table?

01:21:41.887 --> 01:21:43.155
Yeah, I do vodka cranberry.

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:45.022
I just don't fancy it
on my meat.

01:21:45.055 --> 01:21:46.289
Come on.

01:21:46.322 --> 01:21:49.089
Put a crack on me, Nicky.

01:21:49.122 --> 01:21:50.456
Not unless you try the sauce.

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:52.389
Don't be a slapper
and a bitch.

01:21:52.422 --> 01:21:55.022
Come on, it's Christmas.
Stop arguing.

01:21:55.922 --> 01:21:57.222
All right, Dad.

01:21:59.822 --> 01:22:01.155
Yes.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:04.321
Piss.

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:07.156
Fucking fakes.

01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:08.490
Well, I'm going
to need a crown

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:12.223
if I'm going to continue,
so thank you.

01:22:12.257 --> 01:22:13.889
Fucking bitch.

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:19.557
Oh, yeah, you can't.

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:21.223
Come on, Nicky.

01:22:21.257 --> 01:22:22.523
My name's Bitch.

01:22:22.557 --> 01:22:25.390
No, it was a joke.

01:22:25.423 --> 01:22:27.257
Try some of that sauce
and I'll pull it.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.123
Fucking bitch. Pete?

01:22:29.156 --> 01:22:31.057
You know the rules.

01:22:31.091 --> 01:22:32.291
Seriously?

01:22:32.324 --> 01:22:34.424
The slapper ain't joking.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:44.258
Yeah, it's rank.
Happy now?

01:22:44.291 --> 01:22:45.458
Try it on the meat.

01:22:45.491 --> 01:22:48.057
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.124
Yeah, it's still rank.
Happy now?

01:22:59.925 --> 01:23:01.825
Pull that.

01:23:02.891 --> 01:23:04.459
Thank you.

01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:16.292
What are you
laughing about?

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:23.792
Do you remember that day
I got arrested, Nicky?

01:23:23.826 --> 01:23:25.093
What? No, Mark.

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:26.993
Remind Nicky,
would you, Pete?

01:23:27.026 --> 01:23:29.226
- Hey?
- Yeah.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.926
The day you delivered
our car late,

01:23:30.959 --> 01:23:33.126
I ended up getting nicked.

01:23:33.159 --> 01:23:35.959
Sad times. What about it?

01:23:35.993 --> 01:23:39.859
Who were you fucking in the car
that morning that made you late?

01:23:39.892 --> 01:23:41.959
You don't have to answer that.

01:23:41.993 --> 01:23:44.927
I knew it was you, Nicky,
all along.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.060
Why do you think
I brought you here?

01:23:48.227 --> 01:23:50.127
You think I trusted
this pair or you?

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.994
I knew exactly what was
happening with you and Pete.

01:23:55.027 --> 01:23:57.461
You didn't come here
by accident.

01:23:57.494 --> 01:24:00.561
You think all this is fate?

01:24:00.594 --> 01:24:03.094
It wasn't just about the money
with the Azzis, was it?

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:07.328
You didn't just want
what you felt you'd earned.

01:24:08.595 --> 01:24:11.195
You wanted them and Caddy
to go to war,

01:24:11.228 --> 01:24:12.995
to clean each other out

01:24:13.028 --> 01:24:16.328
until you were
the last man standing.

01:24:16.362 --> 01:24:17.928
Or should I say, woman.

01:24:17.961 --> 01:24:21.128
Clever. Clever girl,
ain't you, Nicky?

01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:28.928
He played you like
a fucking cello, Pete.

01:24:28.961 --> 01:24:30.495
You were just waiting
for Head Office

01:24:30.528 --> 01:24:32.829
to hand over the keys,
weren't you, Nicky?

01:24:32.862 --> 01:24:35.429
Give a fuck who gets hurt
in the process?

01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:40.996
Oh, dear.

01:24:41.029 --> 01:24:43.762
You three don't look
too clever at all.

01:24:46.596 --> 01:24:49.129
Maybe it's something you ate.

01:24:57.997 --> 01:24:59.796
That crown worth it,
was it?

01:25:37.331 --> 01:25:39.131
Pete?

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:42.131
Marky?

01:25:44.099 --> 01:25:45.865
Marky?

01:25:45.898 --> 01:25:48.065
Right on time,
just like you said.

01:25:49.132 --> 01:25:50.832
Sadit didn't know what hit him.

01:25:52.332 --> 01:25:54.199
Dear, oh dear, oh dear.

01:25:56.566 --> 01:25:58.399
We did it.

01:26:00.332 --> 01:26:02.366
Well, you still got them, Marky.

01:26:04.099 --> 01:26:05.266
I'm surprised.

01:26:06.366 --> 01:26:08.766
You earned yourself
a Christmas bonus.

01:26:10.066 --> 01:26:12.367
Well, here's to you, Marky.
Merry Christ...

01:27:39.303 --> 01:27:41.303
Fuck.

01:27:41.336 --> 01:27:43.070
Oy.

01:27:43.104 --> 01:27:45.070
No sleeping on the job.

01:27:45.104 --> 01:27:47.170
Come on. Get up.

01:27:47.204 --> 01:27:49.437
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:27:49.471 --> 01:27:52.237
Get the fuck up.

01:27:54.504 --> 01:27:55.837
Let's go.

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:57.970
Come on, ready?
Ready.

01:27:58.004 --> 01:27:59.204
Go.

01:28:10.105 --> 01:28:11.472
Forget Spain, Marky.

01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:13.472
I've got to get you
to a hospital.

01:28:13.505 --> 01:28:15.005
No hospitals.

01:28:15.038 --> 01:28:17.205
- Julia, then?
- No.

01:28:17.238 --> 01:28:20.105
- They can't see me like this.
- She could help.

01:28:21.138 --> 01:28:23.005
We're going to the airport.

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.905
All right, but we're going
to a hospital

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:34.006
as soon as we get there.

01:28:34.039 --> 01:28:35.939
- Okay?
- Sure.

01:28:38.506 --> 01:28:41.072
You think Daisy will come
and see us?

01:28:42.406 --> 01:28:43.905
Maybe.

01:28:43.938 --> 01:28:45.273
That'd be nice, eh?

01:28:45.306 --> 01:28:48.172
Yeah.

01:28:48.206 --> 01:28:51.306
Maybe she could bring
some sausage rolls.

01:28:51.339 --> 01:28:53.506
She could. She could.

01:28:55.607 --> 01:28:58.107
Why, don't they have
them over there?

01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:00.207
Don't know, mate.
I've never been.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.240
I thought that's why
you loved it so much.

01:29:02.274 --> 01:29:04.806
Nah. Just seemed like
a nice thought, you know?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:08.407
Sit by the pool in the sun
and chill.

01:29:10.073 --> 01:29:12.007
You'd get one of them
blow up alligators,

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.140
or one you can sit on,
with a cup holder.

01:29:14.173 --> 01:29:16.340
Right, that is the first thing
I'm buying

01:29:16.374 --> 01:29:17.507
as soon as I get there.

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.874
No fucking about, me.

01:29:21.907 --> 01:29:23.974
You reckon the queen
has been to Spain?

01:29:24.008 --> 01:29:26.008
Yeah, of course she has.
She loves it.

01:29:26.041 --> 01:29:30.108
What? They got San Miguel's in
with a cooked breakfast?

01:29:30.141 --> 01:29:32.441
A bit sunburned because
she over did it on the beach.

01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:34.541
Buried Charles
in the sand, isn't it?

01:29:34.575 --> 01:29:36.508
Hang on.

01:29:36.541 --> 01:29:39.141
Don't they have
a King of Spain?

01:29:39.174 --> 01:29:41.807
Yeah. I think they do,
you know.

01:29:41.841 --> 01:29:44.276
You reckon that's why
she goes?

01:29:44.309 --> 01:29:46.009
Dirty old bird.

01:29:46.042 --> 01:29:48.942
She's having it with the king,
isn't she?

01:29:50.376 --> 01:29:52.142
Of course she is.

01:29:52.175 --> 01:29:54.442
Everyone loves to get a bit
on holiday, don't they?

01:29:54.476 --> 01:29:56.808
Good on the girl.

01:29:56.842 --> 01:29:59.808
If the queen can't get any,
what hope the rest of us got?

01:30:02.042 --> 01:30:03.276
Too right.

01:30:15.277 --> 01:30:17.143
To my dear Daisy.

01:30:18.510 --> 01:30:20.277
Here's your pony.

01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:21.976
I'm sorry you can't have
a real one,

01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:23.876
but he loves you
just as much.

01:30:30.176 --> 01:30:32.411
I made it just for you,

01:30:32.444 --> 01:30:34.044
to enjoy this Christmas

01:30:34.077 --> 01:30:35.544
and many more.

01:30:37.044 --> 01:30:38.944
"I look forward to you coming

01:30:38.977 --> 01:30:41.278
and visiting me
in Spain one day.

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:42.877
You and your mom.

01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:44.044
But till then,

01:30:44.077 --> 01:30:46.278
whenever you want to see me,

01:30:46.311 --> 01:30:48.177
or if you start to miss me,

01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:50.111
you just look up
at that sun shining,

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:53.244
and I'll be looking
at the very same thing,

01:30:53.278 --> 01:30:55.279
because that's how close
we are to one another

01:30:55.312 --> 01:30:57.845
at all times.

01:30:57.878 --> 01:30:59.379
I love you.

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:01.312
Always will.

01:31:02.445 --> 01:31:03.978
Dad."
