NARRATOR:
Previously on Nikita:

00:03.504 --> 00:05.085
I know who killed your parents.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.917
They're Division,
3 black-ops program that's gone rogue.

00:08.091 --> 00:11.834
If I was on the inside,
I could get revenge for my family.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.630
We have to stop Division. To do that,
we need to find the black boxes.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.344
MICHAEL: They contain evidence
of every job Division has done.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.636
Operation Sparrow is a move
by Division against the government.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.804
Percy's hiding the prep work
on the boxes.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.268
MICHAEL: Cracking the box
is the way to get ahead of Percy.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.492
How much time do we have?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.450
Birkhoff said the op would go active
in a couple of weeks.

00:40.624 --> 00:44.208
I'm guessing Percy pushes back that time
now that you have his black box.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.039
Operation Sparrow. Honestly.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.041
Where does he come up
with these names?

00:48.257 --> 00:51.841
All I know is the more innocuous
they sound, the more lethal they are.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.547
Percy plays things close to the vest,
but this is--

00:56.265 --> 00:58.506
-He's scared.
-He should be.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.721
Sparrow's an inside job.
It's a move against the government.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.227
So assassinate the president?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.480
Fake a terror attack to start a war?

01:06.984 --> 01:09.976
Whatever it is, if it fails
with Percy's fingerprints on it...

01:10.153 --> 01:11.654
...he burns, and he knows that.

Why not? I've done it twice already.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.714

so he's gonna be on the lookout for you.

without a ﬁght.

he won't be on the lookout for you.

Nikita, if I do this,
I blow my cover within Division.

Michael, if we succeed...

01:48.817 --> 01:51.934

to go wherever you want.

Well, then it's time
to come in from the cold.

02:17.346 --> 02:21.885
I should really get over there,
just in case Percy suspects anything.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.389

will you check on Alex?

Is that what we agreed?

31:34.643 --> 31:38.352

you can keep hunting your black boxes?

Michael in to get you. Did he find you?
