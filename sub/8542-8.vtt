[indistinct chattering]

00:32.206 --> 00:33.163
Omar.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.211
Hey.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.911
[both laugh]

00:52.791 --> 00:55.359
[dance music]

01:06.979 --> 01:08.024
[Yoli]
'Excuse me.'

01:15.379 --> 01:17.512
Excuse...Hey.
Muvete, idiota!

01:17.599 --> 01:18.643
Let me go!

01:31.787 --> 01:33.136
[heel scrapes]

01:33.223 --> 01:34.659
- What are you, blind?
-I'm sorry.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.235
[cell phone buzzing]

01:50.980 --> 01:52.590
[phone snaps shut]

[police radio chatter]

02:04.428 --> 02:07.039
[siren blaring]

02:16.614 --> 02:20.531
Ah. You look, uh,
marginally rested.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.143
I was hoping I'd actually
get to REM. Sleep tonight.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.928
There's another detective here.
Maybe you can go back to bed.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.191
That's weird. Sac PD called
for help on this.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.584
You two CBI?

02:29.671 --> 02:32.413
Yeah, I'm Teresa Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.372
Sergeant Henderson. Just holding
down the scene till you arrived.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.331
I was in the neighborhood.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.377
Two shots to the head.
No purse or ID on the victim.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.249
The car's registered
to a Yolanda Herrera.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.772
[Lisbon]
'Any witnesses?'

02:43.859 --> 02:46.209
No, but these officers
responded to an anonymous tip

02:46.296 --> 02:48.690
so somebody
had to see something.

02:48.777 --> 02:52.433
It's from, uh, Luxure. It's
a, uh, club down the street.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.261
She wouldn't be
the first club head

02:54.348 --> 02:56.088
I've seen done
in by her dealer.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.744
I applaud your certainty but I
don't think it's cut and dried.

02:59.831 --> 03:03.922
She got the clothes right,
look at her hands. Short nails.

03:04.009 --> 03:05.576
very sloppy paint job.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.404
[Lisbon]
'Maybe she was in a rush.'

03:07.491 --> 03:09.363
Doubtful. Free pass
to the champagne room

03:09.450 --> 03:12.975
requires very careful
attention to detail.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.759
You gotta be joking, huh?

03:14.846 --> 03:17.327
I work these streets.
I know a club girl.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.460
Apparently not, because you
missed a small bruise

03:19.547 --> 03:22.289
on her left ankle. I'm guessing
she turned her ankle

03:22.376 --> 03:23.986
trying to walk
in these shoes.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.770
And her arms
are very well muscled.

03:25.857 --> 03:28.469
Lisbon, correct me
if I'm wrong--

03:28.556 --> 03:32.560
that appears to be
a sports bra she's wearing.

03:32.647 --> 03:34.866
- I don't know. Probably.
- What are you getting at?

03:34.953 --> 03:37.304
Well, your club girl here
was in a disguise--

03:37.391 --> 03:39.697
A tomboy
trying to blend in.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.265
The question is why?

03:42.352 --> 03:43.919
And what was her game?

03:44.006 --> 03:46.182
Is this really productive?

03:46.269 --> 03:47.357
You knew her.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.577
No, I didn't.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.840
Your voice just pitched
a little higher like when

03:51.927 --> 03:53.885
[Jane]
'you said you happened
to be around.'

03:53.972 --> 03:56.061
Is he right?
Did you know the victim?

03:56.148 --> 03:57.585
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.632
Aha! I know who this woman--
this--this woman here--

04:01.719 --> 04:02.677
okay. I'm here.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.461
Hey, what the hell
is going on?

04:04.548 --> 04:06.376
Yolanda Herrera
is an undercover cop.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.160
That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
Yeah, big whoop for you,
smart ass.

04:10.337 --> 04:13.688
No one can know that. It'll be
more dangerous for the next cop.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.777
You're not known for
your management skills.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.301
Work the case.
I'll help you where I can.

04:18.388 --> 04:21.478
But Yoli's identity
must remain confidential.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.828
And keep this circus act
under control, got it?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.439
Got it. Yeah.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.397
Wha--

04:27.484 --> 04:30.095
Disappointing, Lisbon. I thought
you might push back a little.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.446
Guy called me
a "circus act."

04:32.533 --> 04:35.187
Hey. The man is grieving.
You push back.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.711
- Okay, I will.
- Don't you dare.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.191
- Okay. Said that I could.
- I take it back.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.541
- Alright.
- Okay?

04:40.628 --> 04:42.412
[inhales deeply]

04:42.499 --> 04:43.674
I need a little rest.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.678
[theme music]

04:56.252 --> 04:57.209
[Officer]
'Yolanda Concepcion
was her real name'

04:57.297 --> 04:58.776
but everyone
called her "Yoli."

04:58.863 --> 05:01.388
She leaves behind a family--
Husband, two young children.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.869
She's a valuable member
of my narcotics task force.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.654
What was she doing
out here tonight?

05:06.741 --> 05:08.177
She's supposed to be
getting friendly

05:08.264 --> 05:10.092
with a dealer named Omar Vega.

05:10.179 --> 05:12.529
He's a major player here
in South Sac.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.966
We think his crew
is behind a

05:15.053 --> 05:16.707
recent rise
in crime around here.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.710
- You think Vega made her cover?
- Too early to tell.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.844
But he's popped people for a lot
less than being undercover cops.

05:22.931 --> 05:26.326
Okay. We'll start
at the club. Thanks.

05:26.413 --> 05:29.285
Jane, meet me at Luxure.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.765
[rock music]

05:30.852 --> 05:32.332
What?

05:32.419 --> 05:33.376
I can't hear you!

05:35.378 --> 05:37.511
Still can't hear you!

05:37.598 --> 05:40.252
Bye!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.603
[rock music]

05:51.481 --> 05:53.831
- Jane!
- Oh, hey, Lisbon!

05:53.918 --> 05:56.965
Meet Vince Candide. He's our
host. He's a womanizing buffoon

05:57.052 --> 05:59.228
but I think you'll be
amused by his presumption.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.186
- What?
- Huh?

06:01.273 --> 06:02.405
He..

06:02.492 --> 06:04.581
This is...he..

06:04.668 --> 06:06.148
Have you seen this woman?

06:08.237 --> 06:10.239
What about Omar Vega?

06:10.326 --> 06:11.283
Who?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.764
[both]
Omar Vega!

06:13.851 --> 06:15.940
Sorry. I gotta go run the place.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.639
He can't hear!

06:18.726 --> 06:19.683
Thanks, Vince!

06:25.733 --> 06:27.865
If Vega's here,
he's over there.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.392
[Jane]
'Thank you.'

06:35.786 --> 06:37.788
Ah, that's more like it.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.356
Pardon me,
have you seen Omar Vega?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.402
You're never gonna
find him like that.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.535
What do we got here?

06:45.622 --> 06:46.971
[feedback whines]

06:48.973 --> 06:51.367
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your attention.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.717
My colleague over there

06:53.804 --> 06:56.154
in her not-here-to-party
clothes

06:56.241 --> 06:57.678
is five-o.

06:57.765 --> 06:58.983
Yeah, CBI.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.029
She's looking for Omar Vega.

07:01.116 --> 07:04.946
I have $500 in this pocket
for whoever can point him out.

07:05.033 --> 07:08.645
That's 500 big ones
just to use your pointy finger.

07:08.732 --> 07:11.605
And then we'll take it
from there.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.128
Thank you. Party on.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.043
Subtle.

07:15.130 --> 07:17.567
But effective.
He's over by the bar.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.396
[indistinct chattering]

07:20.483 --> 07:22.180
You're someone nobody
wants to look at

07:22.267 --> 07:24.748
so I'm guessing
you're Mr. Vega.

07:24.835 --> 07:25.880
I like your swagger.

07:25.967 --> 07:26.968
Well, thank you.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.797
We're investigating
a murder.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.103
No need.
I know what Yoli looks like.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.323
I hear she got popped. Shame.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.630
Was Yoli
at the club tonight?

07:36.717 --> 07:40.024
You know the answer to that,
or you wouldn't be here.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.766
- Did you talk to her?
- Yeah. Maybe.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.813
- What did you talk about?
- Foolishness.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.554
She's just another haina
from the neighborhood

07:47.641 --> 07:49.730
trying to get my attention.

07:49.817 --> 07:50.818
Hmm.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.950
And did she
get your attention?

07:53.037 --> 07:54.212
Did you take her outside?

07:54.299 --> 07:55.910
No, ma'am, I did not.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.914
I've been here all night.
Please, ask around.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.699
No need.
He's telling the truth.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.222
I've got nothing to hide.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.529
Well, that's not
entirely true.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.097
You're hiding
profound anger.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.402
Is that right?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.709
Mm. Mm-hmm.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.974
The tension in your jawline
gives it away.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.587
[Jane]
'What is it
that's bothering you?'

08:20.674 --> 08:23.111
It's not a woman.
I don't think you care enough.

08:23.198 --> 08:26.462
Not global warming.
What is it you covet most?

08:26.549 --> 08:28.943
Money? No.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.814
Respect.

08:30.901 --> 08:34.601
This is a question
of respect.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.690
Someone disrespected you,
didn't they?

08:36.777 --> 08:38.822
How? What did they do
to you?

08:38.909 --> 08:41.912
Keep guessing, pinstripes.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.610
Pinstripes.Ma'am..

08:43.697 --> 08:45.046
Are we done?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.874
Yes, we're done, sir.

08:51.966 --> 08:52.967
Whew.

08:54.795 --> 08:55.926
Interesting.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.711
Yeah.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.148
I like the "pinstripes."

09:00.235 --> 09:03.499
Vega took control of South Sac
in less than a year.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.806
His competitors didn't agree
to work with him...

09:05.893 --> 09:07.111
..they ended up like this.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.157
Yeah, I see how
that could be persuasive.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.375
No criminal record?

09:10.462 --> 09:12.508
Vega's brutal and smart.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.466
Always one step
ahead of us.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.860
Ran his organization
like a terror cell.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.384
Everyone knows what they
need to get the job done.

09:19.471 --> 09:22.170
So his hands stay clean.
What was Yoli's assignment?

09:22.257 --> 09:25.216
To find Vega's current base of
operation. It's always changing.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.262
We've got our work
cut out for us.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.612
- Where are we with suspects?
- None we can find.

09:29.699 --> 09:32.136
I've a copy of the 9-1-1 call,
from a payphone

09:32.223 --> 09:34.835
three blocks away
from the crime scene.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.967
[woman on tape recorder
'9-1-1, what's your emergency?'

09:37.054 --> 09:39.143
[Summer]
'Um, yeah, there's a dead chick'

09:39.230 --> 09:41.581
on Kennon near 4th
in case you're interested.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.060
Are there cameras
near that phone?

09:43.147 --> 09:44.627
None.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.890
Got a hit on the victims
missing credit cards.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.066
Room charge, this
morning at a downtown hotel.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.461
Take Rigsby. Yoli's cell phone
was missing, too, right?

09:52.548 --> 09:54.550
Yeah, but the carrier hasn't
received a signal

09:54.637 --> 09:56.508
since last night.
Whoever took the phone

09:56.596 --> 09:58.249
powered it down
or pulled the battery.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.511
Stay on it.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.777
- You talked to the family yet?
- I'm headed there now.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.735
What do they know
about Yoli's assignment?

10:05.822 --> 10:08.433
Nothing. It's an ongoing
investigation, so they can't.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.609
Understood.

10:12.524 --> 10:16.137
[Lolo]
'I told her not to get involved
in this undercover crap.'

10:16.224 --> 10:18.443
Desk jobs have benefits.
They pay good enough.

10:19.923 --> 10:22.143
It was one of these
drug dealers, wasn't it?

10:22.230 --> 10:24.711
I'm afraid I can't talk
about that now.

10:24.798 --> 10:28.453
Still? Are you kidding me? What
does it matter now? My wife's--

10:28.540 --> 10:30.455
[Jane]
'She's the greatest mother
in the world.'

10:38.725 --> 10:40.161
Hello there.

10:40.248 --> 10:43.643
Who is it? Hi.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.035
Rafi?

10:45.122 --> 10:46.733
[Elvia]
Rafi? Rafi?

10:48.430 --> 10:51.825
Oh, there you are. I got him.
Sorry about that, Lalo.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.088
This is Elvia, Yoli's cousin.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.178
She moved in a couple months ago
to help with the kids.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.440
He's a beautiful boy.

10:58.527 --> 11:01.182
[Rafi babbling]

11:01.269 --> 11:02.313
He doesn't know yet.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.450
How do you tell a little kid
he won't see his mom again?

11:08.537 --> 11:10.495
Did she talk to you
about her work?

11:10.582 --> 11:16.327
No. But I barely knew what Yoli
was doing on a daily basis.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.721
I'm sorry.
Why are we doing this?

11:18.808 --> 11:21.158
To bring your wife's
murder to justice.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.030
For you and your family.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.031
Justice?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.295
You think
my kids are gonna care

11:27.382 --> 11:30.515
when some crack dealer
goes down for this?

11:30.602 --> 11:34.650
They lost their mother.
I lost my wife.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.652
For what?

11:36.739 --> 11:37.871
War on drugs?

11:41.875 --> 11:42.963
Give me a break.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.533
[humming]

11:48.620 --> 11:50.622
[pot bubbling]

11:52.494 --> 11:53.756
Mm!

11:53.843 --> 11:56.585
- 'That's a nice tune.'
- Oh! Ooh.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.457
Didn't mean to startle you.
I'm sorry. What--what's cooking?

11:59.544 --> 12:01.808
Spaghetti.
It's for the kids' lunch.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.200
Ah.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.333
You and Yoli must have
been very close

12:05.420 --> 12:07.509
to help out
with the family like this.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.034
Yeah. We were like sisters.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.907
Really? I don't think so.

12:13.994 --> 12:14.951
What?

12:15.038 --> 12:16.431
The humming.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.520
I hum. So what?

12:18.607 --> 12:21.523
Well, humming--
it's like comfort food.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.264
Takes us back to the breast.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.049
And you are the mom
of the family now, aren't you?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.531
Deep down,
you're glad she's dead.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.882
What the hell
kind of cop are you?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.623
Jane? What's going on?

12:34.710 --> 12:37.191
I was about to ask Elvia what
she was doing

12:37.278 --> 12:38.496
at Luxure last night.

12:40.629 --> 12:44.676
The faded stamp on your wrist.
I have one just like it.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.461
You followed Yoli
while she was working?

12:46.548 --> 12:49.377
Elvia, what were you thinking?
I swear, if you did anything

12:49.464 --> 12:50.421
to get her killed..

12:50.508 --> 12:51.596
Why'd you follow her?

12:51.683 --> 12:55.731
Uh, she has
a little thing for Lalo.

12:55.818 --> 12:56.950
What--what are you
talking about?

12:58.081 --> 12:59.387
I think she should explain.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.915
Yoli didn't deserve you.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.483
Look, I-I..

13:08.570 --> 13:12.400
what I found in her jeans when
I was washing more than once.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.097
Condoms. Yoli was on the pill.

13:14.184 --> 13:17.144
I went to the club to see
who she was sleeping with.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.798
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.322
I--she was in a rush
to get out of there

13:21.409 --> 13:23.280
and texting somebody,
but I lost her.

13:23.367 --> 13:27.328
We'll need you to come to the
office, make a full statement.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.591
Might as well pack
your things before you go.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.029
You're not coming back
in this house.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.814
B-but...

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
I went there for you, Lalo!

13:40.254 --> 13:42.256
Whoa.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.736
Little more salt,
but that's pretty good.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.086
Kids are gonna love that.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.135
A charge was made, this morning
from a stolen credit card.

13:52.222 --> 13:53.920
Let me guess--
husband on the prowl?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.617
Killer on the run.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.661
Oh.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.360
[man #1]
'Uh, here we go.'

13:59.447 --> 14:01.318
'One American breakfast,
three bloody marys'

14:01.405 --> 14:03.712
delivered to room 618.

14:03.799 --> 14:04.844
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.112
[man #2]
Who's there?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.504
Police. Open the door.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.766
Just a minute!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.246
[thud]

14:16.333 --> 14:17.421
[beep]

14:18.988 --> 14:19.989
Please don't shoot.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.819
[groans]
I got it.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.038
[Rigsby]
'Get up. Come on.'

14:26.648 --> 14:29.129
can you pass me
a hand towel?

14:29.216 --> 14:30.826
Step out of
the bathroom, please.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.350
I swear to God, I've never seen
that woman before.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.397
Oh, shush. Put that thing away.
What are you, a maniac?

14:36.484 --> 14:37.964
You could hurt someone.

14:44.448 --> 14:47.364
[Cho]
So, Summer, I need you to tell
me why you were making charges

14:47.451 --> 14:49.192
on a murder victim's
credit card

14:49.279 --> 14:50.977
hours after her death.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.674
Cho...

14:52.761 --> 14:54.806
that's Korean, right?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.548
I also need you to explain
how you got that card.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.767
Bad back, huh?

15:00.290 --> 15:01.291
Yeah.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.989
I can tell.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.253
Is there anything I can do
to make it any better?

15:06.340 --> 15:07.950
No.

15:08.037 --> 15:11.127
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

15:11.214 --> 15:14.304
Look, I don't know anything
about any dead chick.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.742
[click]

15:17.829 --> 15:20.136
[woman on tape recorder]
'Yeah, there's a dead chick'

15:20.223 --> 15:22.182
on Kennon near 4th in case you're interested.

15:22.269 --> 15:23.705
[laughs]

15:25.489 --> 15:27.143
Wow! You're way more slick

15:27.230 --> 15:29.189
than the trolls that
usually bust my butt.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.712
- Did you shoot the victim?
- No!

15:30.799 --> 15:32.322
Did you see who did?

15:32.409 --> 15:35.108
I heard shots. I ran to help.
She was already dead.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.631
At least I called it in.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.154
You ran to help?

15:38.241 --> 15:40.374
Why wouldn't I?
Poor thing.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.158
You took the victim's
credit cards.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.294
This is about Omar Vega,
isn't it?

15:50.166 --> 15:51.994
What do you know
about Vega?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.691
Hmm.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.259
I know that your dead girl
was hanging with him.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.567
I also know that I've an 18-hour
window with a stolen card,

15:59.654 --> 16:02.309
but you made it there
in record time.

16:02.396 --> 16:03.527
You're after someone big.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.442
Ahem.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.575
Look, I know things.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.534
Maybe we could make a deal.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.275
- What do you got?
- What's your deal?

16:16.192 --> 16:18.586
You give me something useful,
I'll drop the theft charge.

16:19.717 --> 16:20.849
Pinkie swear?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.330
Fine.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.986
Vega just got his ass
handed to him.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.032
The Perry Boys raided his
stash house a couple days ago.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.078
- Cleaned out all his coke.
- How much?

16:32.165 --> 16:33.731
Like ten keys, maybe more.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.954
- The Perry Boys?
- Yeah. The Perry Boys.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.567
Vega needs more product
and revenge fast,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.917
or else his customers
are gonna be lost

16:46.005 --> 16:48.616
and, uh,
he'll lose respect.

16:48.703 --> 16:52.098
I bet you just doodle
in that thing, don't you?

16:52.185 --> 16:53.360
[chuckles]

16:55.492 --> 16:59.888
So. That's enough to
get me out of here, right?

16:59.975 --> 17:01.020
I'll let you know.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.075
So? Do you like her
for the murder?

17:13.162 --> 17:15.034
[Lisbon]
'No, but I like her.'

17:15.817 --> 17:17.340
What do you got?

17:17.427 --> 17:19.821
Uh, text messages from
the victim's cell phone.

17:19.908 --> 17:22.519
Yoli's cousin said she was
texting while leaving the club.

17:22.606 --> 17:25.914
What was the last text she sent
before she was murdered?

17:26.001 --> 17:27.959
Uh, "on my way.
Open the champagne.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.440
Our favorite hotel?"
sounds personal.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.529
Very personal.
Who's it to?

17:32.616 --> 17:35.576
Uh, prepaid phone.
No record of the owner.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.361
Her cousin might have been mad
about this affair business.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.624
I think we should talk
to her boss again.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.237
[intense music]

17:47.805 --> 17:51.157
Excuse me. We're looking
for Sergeant Henderson's office.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.289
- Towards the back on the left.
- Thanks.

17:53.376 --> 17:54.551
That Yoli's desk there?

17:54.638 --> 17:56.379
Yeah, that's where she sat.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.685
Oh. Thank you.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.818
[Patrick]
I'll catch up with you.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.472
[Lisbon]
'Alright. Don't wander off.'

18:02.559 --> 18:03.647
Wouldn't dream of it.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.046
[intense music]

18:20.273 --> 18:22.318
The text messages started
two weeks ago.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.929
They paint a picture
of a pretty wild affair.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.367
Did you know if Yoli
was romantically involved

18:27.454 --> 18:29.238
with anyone on the job?

18:29.325 --> 18:30.805
I can assure you,
Agent Lisbon

18:30.892 --> 18:33.460
I keep a tight rein
over my undercover officers.

18:33.547 --> 18:36.289
Then how do you explain those
texts? There's pages of them.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.334
These aren't love tweets.
These are gang codes.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.467
Yoli picked this up while
surveilling a gang

18:40.554 --> 18:41.946
a couple months back.
Look--

18:42.033 --> 18:44.688
See that? "champagne"
is cocaine,

18:44.775 --> 18:47.517
uh, "on her way"
is someone's in trouble.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.084
Who uses that code?

18:49.171 --> 18:51.130
Nobody you ever heard of.
The Perry Boys.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.393
A renegade stick-up outfit.
Two brothers and a cousin?

18:53.480 --> 18:55.177
How do you know
about them?

18:55.264 --> 18:58.963
I did some research when I found
out they hit Vega's stash house.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.704
Vega was robbed?

19:00.791 --> 19:03.925
Two days before Yoli's murder.
She didn't tell you about it?

19:04.012 --> 19:06.928
I thought you kept
a tight rein on your people.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.670
Look, nothing in
Yoli's surveillance reports

19:09.757 --> 19:11.106
ever mention the Perrys.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.239
Is it possible
she was working with them--

19:13.326 --> 19:15.110
that's why she didn't
report the robbery?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.199
She wouldn't compromise
her team that way.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.722
Yoli wasn't dirty.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.289
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.552
I've one of my people
at her house now

19:22.639 --> 19:24.380
looking for evidence
of an affair.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.601
Van Pelt,
new marching orders--

19:27.688 --> 19:29.646
Find out
if Yoli was on the take

19:29.733 --> 19:32.867
or in contact with a gang
called the Perry Boys.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.129
[clatter]

19:41.092 --> 19:42.398
can I help you?

19:42.485 --> 19:44.748
I'm sorry. I was trying
not to bother you.

19:44.835 --> 19:47.403
But, uh, but since
you asked, yes.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.404
Uh... who's that guy?

19:51.364 --> 19:52.756
That's Trey.

19:52.843 --> 19:56.107
Trey. Is--uh,
a fellow officer?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.632
Yeah, we all came in
the same year.

19:58.719 --> 20:02.157
So you and Yoli
must have been close?

20:02.244 --> 20:05.595
That girl was my heart.
She was always there for me.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.729
My partner seems
to believe that, um

20:10.121 --> 20:12.863
that Yoli was
having an affair.

20:12.950 --> 20:16.215
Nah. Yoli would never
cheat on Lalo.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.783
Her family found condoms
in her pockets more than once.

20:19.870 --> 20:22.003
We all carry 'em.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.005
Never know when you've to
waterproof drug samples

20:24.092 --> 20:26.355
when you're in the field.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.400
Handy to know.

20:29.097 --> 20:31.578
[indistinct chattering on TV]

20:38.019 --> 20:41.414
Alright, mama.
Nap time is now.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.502
Get in bed.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.943
How much longer
is this gonna take?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.640
I don't know.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.687
Tell me what you're looking for.
Maybe I can speed this up.

20:53.774 --> 20:56.167
My kids won't go to sleep
with you here.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.953
I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't discuss the case.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.695
Another Robocop.
Where do they find you people?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.309
These are all family files.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.485
Did Yoli keep
any private records?

21:09.572 --> 21:14.011
Uh, a personal journal
or diary, maybe?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.578
You can check her computer.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.146
We already did, at work
and the laptop at home.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.017
She didn't keep anything
important on those.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.193
Too paranoid.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.935
What computer did she use?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.334
Right there.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.379
Excuse me.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.382
It's okay, Rafi.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.427
The lady needs
to look at the computer.

21:38.514 --> 21:39.907
She won't be here long.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.605
[mouse clicking]

21:45.086 --> 21:47.393
[instrumental music]

21:53.573 --> 21:55.270
She'll be gone
in a few minutes.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.489
[Lalo]
'It's okay.'

21:59.013 --> 22:01.320
[instrumental music]

22:12.113 --> 22:13.027
- 'Van Pelt.'
- Hey, boss.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.985
Did you find anything?

22:15.072 --> 22:18.032
[Grace]
'Yoli uploaded photos of a house
onto her kids' computer'

22:18.119 --> 22:19.729
'the day before the crime.'

22:19.816 --> 22:21.601
The photos link
to a foreclosure site

22:21.688 --> 22:24.734
that show the house has been
vacant for six months.

22:24.821 --> 22:27.607
The perfect place
for the Perrys to hide out.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.000
We're gonna need
that address.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.481
Daddy's home.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.265
Hey! You must be Trey.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.356
Hey. I must be.
Who am I waving at?

22:37.443 --> 22:41.316
I'm one of the CBI people
investigating Yoli's murder.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.709
Yeah? On our couch?

22:42.796 --> 22:44.798
Well, you'd be surprised
what you can learn.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.148
Really? Like what?

22:47.235 --> 22:48.367
Well, this particular couch

22:48.454 --> 22:50.325
it's very comfortable
on the first sit

22:50.412 --> 22:53.372
but, uh, after time, gonna give
your back a lot of grief.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.069
Hey, are you ready to go?

22:55.156 --> 22:56.984
- Where we going?
- Tracking the Perry Boys.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.726
- They may have killed Yoli.
- You want me to come?

22:59.813 --> 23:02.468
- We got extra vests.
- Yeah, probably not my size.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.992
- Why don't you wait here?
- That's great--I'll wait here.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.776
Hold down the fort.
Good luck.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.130
It's a whole new you.

23:13.217 --> 23:17.396
Yeah. Be happy I wasn't
out there as a crackhead today.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.485
Props include
urine-soaked pants.

23:19.572 --> 23:20.529
[Jane]
'Charming.'

23:22.662 --> 23:25.099
Uh, are those props, too?

23:25.186 --> 23:28.276
Drugs? No.
These are the real deal.

23:28.363 --> 23:29.799
I was out doing
hand-to-hands today.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.584
You know, making buys
in different areas

23:31.671 --> 23:33.324
see who
the current sellers are.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.805
That's quite a haul.
Colorful.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.546
What--what do you do
with the goods?

23:39.983 --> 23:42.333
Everything goes
into the property room.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.336
Investigation unit catches you
with as much as a crack pipe

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
in your car, they come down
pretty hard.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.906
Mm.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.560
Must be difficult
living two lives.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.086
Well, you learn
to compartmentalize.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.784
Mm. How was Yoli with that?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.396
Yoli. God bless her.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.181
She was one of the best,
actually. She had to be.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.966
- You met her family, right?
- Mm-hmm.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.534
Yeah, she was putting that
husband of hers through school.

24:08.621 --> 24:11.493
So Yoli was good,
but, uh, you're better?

24:13.495 --> 24:17.151
So why is it that Yoli got
the, uh, Vega case and not you?

24:17.238 --> 24:18.892
That's--
that's the big case, right?

24:18.979 --> 24:22.548
Well, let's just say the short
dresses didn't hurt Yoli at all.

24:22.635 --> 24:23.940
Tell you one thing, though,

24:24.027 --> 24:26.508
I wouldn't have let Vega's men
do me like that.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.249
You think Vega
had her killed?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.425
[Terry]
'Aw, come on.
She's an undercover cop.'

24:30.512 --> 24:32.296
This guy's
a notorious gangster.

24:32.383 --> 24:35.169
How far have you really
gotta look?

24:35.256 --> 24:36.257
'Sup, trey?

24:36.344 --> 24:37.388
[Trey]
'You got it.'

24:37.476 --> 24:39.042
- Oh.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.175
I'm sorry. Trey--
oh, that's embarrassing.

24:41.262 --> 24:44.265
Mike, you got a towel,
a napkin or something? Come on.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.136
That's terrible.
My bad.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.098
Wipe that there. Uh, gonna need
another one of these, mike.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.187
Okay, great. Thank you.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.451
So clumsy.
I-I'm sorry.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.845
[car doors close]

24:58.932 --> 25:01.195
we're looking for Warren,
Dwayne, and Russell Perry.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.631
Expect them to be armed.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.633
They're erratic
and extremely dangerous.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.380
- Van Pelt, you take the side.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.078
[intense music]

25:27.700 --> 25:29.440
[gunfire]

25:29.528 --> 25:31.225
[man groaning]

25:31.965 --> 25:32.922
Police!

25:34.358 --> 25:36.273
[man grunting]

25:39.015 --> 25:42.453
[man #3]
We didn't come here
to work out. Don't move, kid.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
[Lisbon]
Put your hands in the air!

25:44.630 --> 25:46.545
[man grunting]

25:49.286 --> 25:51.158
Uh! Aah!

25:51.245 --> 25:53.508
[intense music]

25:56.816 --> 25:59.253
[voice on TV]
'I did what I had to do'

25:59.340 --> 26:00.428
Clear.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.038
It's definitely
the Perrys.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.300
[Voice on TV]
'I fought.'

26:06.086 --> 26:08.218
[Grace]
'Hey, boss, I got one down
back here!'

26:10.351 --> 26:12.701
[men grunting]

26:14.660 --> 26:16.226
'nobody could help me.'

26:22.798 --> 26:23.756
[door opens]

26:27.542 --> 26:30.023
- Where'd all this come from?
- Mm.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.938
Your friend Wayne
is so sweet.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.244
Now there's a man
who knows how to smile.

26:34.331 --> 26:35.811
Was he in a boy band?

26:35.898 --> 26:38.422
You were right
about Vega.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.207
So my information
was helpful?

26:40.294 --> 26:41.991
No, but it was accurate.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.993
You're free to go.
All charges are dropped.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.390
Thank you, Agent Cho.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.001
Kimball.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.002
You're welcome.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.271
You know..

27:01.358 --> 27:03.056
...you should do something
about your back.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.971
It's nothing.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.363
You're very
invested in this

27:06.450 --> 27:08.801
man-in-an-iron-face
routine, aren't you?

27:08.888 --> 27:11.368
I bet I could make you
cry like a baby.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.111
I'll bet.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.375
There may be hope
for you yet.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.814
[instrumental music]

27:23.903 --> 27:27.558
Sac PD Narco unit just finished
searching the Perry's house.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.431
They found baggies, scales,
drug residue, but no drugs.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.215
Looks like Vega
stole his coke back.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.305
The Perrys let the killer in
the house. Someone they trusted.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.960
Otherwise, Dwayne would've
died with a gun in his hand

27:38.047 --> 27:39.658
instead of
a video game controller.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.268
Did ballistics come back?

27:41.355 --> 27:43.574
Yeah, the .380 casings
found at the Perry house

27:43.662 --> 27:46.360
match those from Yoli's crime
scene, all from the same gun.

27:46.447 --> 27:49.450
ME puts the Perrys' time of
death the same night as Yoli's.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.452
So whoever killed
the Perrys killed Yoli.

27:51.539 --> 27:54.150
Great. We've got no suspects.
We're back to square one.

27:54.237 --> 27:56.413
Well...

27:56.500 --> 27:58.981
I wouldn't say
square one exactly.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.026
No?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.289
No.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.423
[intense music]

28:12.429 --> 28:14.214
Hey, Candide, we're ready.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.784
[intense music]

28:32.667 --> 28:34.364
[whirring]

28:34.451 --> 28:36.062
[door clanks open]

28:40.196 --> 28:42.721
That's quite an impressive
pile you have there.

28:42.808 --> 28:44.287
What are you, uh, doing here?

28:44.374 --> 28:45.506
I'm looking for you.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.682
Well, you can't be
back here.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.032
I can be wherever I wanna be.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.207
Oh. Who says?

28:52.339 --> 28:53.470
The law.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.776
It knows no bounds.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.998
What do you want?

28:59.085 --> 29:00.956
I'm not sure yet.

29:01.043 --> 29:03.306
Glad to see you're having
such a good week.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.527
How much do you want?

29:07.528 --> 29:10.226
Mm... 20.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.271
- Grand?
- Percent.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.490
That--that's insane.

29:14.448 --> 29:17.016
Okay, then. Make it 25.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.539
Get out.

29:18.626 --> 29:19.845
I tell you what--

29:19.932 --> 29:23.065
You tell Omar Vega
I got a deal to make

29:23.152 --> 29:24.763
and we'll call it square.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.939
I told you I don't know
any Vega.

29:27.026 --> 29:28.897
No?

29:28.984 --> 29:31.552
Then why are you
counting his money?

29:31.639 --> 29:34.076
Vega uses this club
to launder his drug money.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.165
It's his club,
that's obvious.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.645
[Jane]
'Look at you.'

29:37.732 --> 29:39.603
You're not a big time
club owner.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.651
You tell Vega there's more
where that came from.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.961
[phone beeps]

29:50.049 --> 29:52.399
[intense music]

29:56.185 --> 29:59.885
That pro seemed like
a piece of work, huh?

29:59.972 --> 30:00.929
Who, Summer?

30:01.016 --> 30:02.626
Oh, she's "Summer" now.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.759
She is summer.
That's her name.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.543
Just like she knows
your name's Wayne.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.415
Look, it was just
some potato chips.

30:08.502 --> 30:09.720
You emptied
the vending machine.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.852
Yeah. She was hungry.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.464
Copy that.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.773
Hi. I was just leaving.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.296
No. You're not.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.559
No? I guess I'm not.

30:22.646 --> 30:25.432
[hip-hopmusic]

30:25.519 --> 30:27.477
we're up.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.871
[music continues]

30:32.831 --> 30:34.702
Whoa!

30:34.789 --> 30:37.400
You mind turning
the bass down a little?

30:37.487 --> 30:39.141
Makes me wanna
go to the bathroom!

30:42.971 --> 30:44.538
You got a signal?

30:44.625 --> 30:45.626
Yeah.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.760
Just give 'em a lead
before you go.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.547
[engine cranks]

30:56.637 --> 30:59.074
[intense music

31:09.519 --> 31:10.520
Straight.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.484
Turn right here.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.140
[music continues]

31:24.578 --> 31:27.189
[Cho]
'I know this neighborhood.
It's derelict.'

31:27.276 --> 31:29.670
It's a perfect place to set up
a drug operation.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.021
[Rigsby]
'Okay, they stopped.
Slow down.'

31:33.108 --> 31:35.632
They're just a few hundred
feet ahead. Let's park here.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.768
How many months
has Sac PD's narco team

31:40.855 --> 31:43.553
been looking for Vega's hideout?
We found it in one day.

31:45.468 --> 31:48.080
[intense music]

31:50.952 --> 31:52.345
I don't see the SUV.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.045
They must have pulled into
one of these warehouses.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.439
Yeah, but where?

31:59.526 --> 32:02.355
Wait a second. Where'd you hide
Jane's tracking device?

32:02.442 --> 32:04.009
His jacket lining.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.097
[exhales]

32:06.054 --> 32:08.274
Jane's jacket and shoes.

32:08.361 --> 32:09.797
We're screwed.

32:09.884 --> 32:10.972
We're fine.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.670
Jane's screwed.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.896
...So I was thinking

32:21.983 --> 32:23.724
it's getting a little
crowded in here.

32:23.811 --> 32:25.682
Walk away.

32:25.769 --> 32:27.249
[Summer groans]
Right now.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.429
If you wanted a date,
all you had to do was ask.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.257
- Where can I find Omar Vega?
- Why?

32:35.344 --> 32:36.824
He's got one of our people.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.347
What makes you think
I know?

32:38.434 --> 32:40.393
You're a hooker.
You had intel on Vega.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.003
You must sleep with his men.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.962
You don't mince
your words, do you?

32:44.049 --> 32:46.573
- I don't have time for this.
- Neither do I.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.618
I just spent an hour
talking to him.

32:48.705 --> 32:49.968
You chased off big money.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.535
Now I have to start
from the beginning.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.189
What the hell
are you doing?

32:54.276 --> 32:55.538
I'm arresting you
for solicitation.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.977
Make sure
you make it tight.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.370
I know how you love
to assert your authority.

33:01.457 --> 33:03.677
What's the matter with you?
A life's at stake.

33:03.764 --> 33:07.072
What is wrong with you?You
think you can come here

33:07.159 --> 33:10.292
and take whatever you want from
me whenever you want it?

33:10.379 --> 33:11.990
You're used
to getting paid. Fine.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.861
How much do you want?

33:13.948 --> 33:15.776
I don't want
your money, Cho.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.083
I was just looking
for a little common courtesy.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.743
Vega's held up at an abandoned
garage on Tenth Street.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.225
Now, take these off of me
and leave me the hell alone.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.147
[handcuffs clicking]

33:43.108 --> 33:45.893
[instrumental music]

33:49.592 --> 33:51.681
A little disappointed
about my shoes.

33:55.598 --> 33:58.601
Is this how
you treat all your guests?

33:58.688 --> 34:01.387
- What do you want to sell me?
- Drugs, of course.

34:01.474 --> 34:05.130
You need a new supplier, or you
might end up shoeless yourself.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.957
Este tontothinks
he's on one, yes?

34:08.481 --> 34:10.787
So, um, this supply--

34:10.874 --> 34:13.486
Where exactly
does it come from?

34:13.573 --> 34:15.966
The narcotics task force
collects information

34:16.054 --> 34:17.533
on every dealer in this city--

34:17.620 --> 34:21.189
Where they operate,
where their stash houses are.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.844
I give you that information
for a fee

34:23.931 --> 34:26.542
and you can re-stock
your supply at will.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.023
[laughs]

34:29.110 --> 34:30.546
How is that amusing?

34:30.633 --> 34:32.983
Oh, it's, um,
it's not funny "ha ha."

34:33.071 --> 34:35.073
it's more funny crazy.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.902
You see, I just got the exact
same offer yesterday.

34:38.989 --> 34:39.990
Mm.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.992
[laughing]

34:42.080 --> 34:45.213
Interesting
negotiating tactic.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.475
I'm gonna call your bluff.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.650
Ah.

34:48.564 --> 34:49.783
You think I'm lying?

34:49.870 --> 34:51.872
There's only one rainmaker.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.353
[sighs]

34:54.440 --> 34:55.832
[clears throat]

34:55.919 --> 34:57.704
Bring her in.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.924
[Bianca]
'What are you doing here?'

35:01.011 --> 35:03.231
Get your hands off me!

35:03.318 --> 35:05.103
Yo! Where's Vega?

35:05.190 --> 35:07.322
I demand to speak to him!
We're business partners!

35:11.196 --> 35:12.893
What's he doing here?

35:12.980 --> 35:14.982
Vega, what are you
doing to me?

35:15.069 --> 35:17.767
I hate to break the news, this
woman's an undercover cop.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.682
Yes, I know exactly what she is.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.729
Actually, she's part of
the same narcotics task force

35:22.816 --> 35:24.774
that you claim
to have access to.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.689
Oh, you're good.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.431
You're very good. She's good.
And you're being set up

35:29.518 --> 35:31.738
for a one-way trip
to the gray bar hotel.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.783
You patted her down
for a wire yet?

35:33.870 --> 35:36.134
Vega, you can't be taking
this guy seriously.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.746
No, to be honest, I don't know
what to make of you two.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.314
I mean, it's not every week
that two dirty cops

35:42.401 --> 35:45.360
show up on my doorstep,
both offering me the same deal.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.232
I mean,
what are the odds, hmm?

35:47.319 --> 35:51.279
Oh, the odds? The odds are
someone's lying. Shoot her now.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.020
Then we'll talk
some business.

35:53.107 --> 35:56.241
Like hell! He's not even a real
cop! This guy's a consultant!

35:56.328 --> 35:58.765
No, you know, I think
that maybe my safest option

35:58.852 --> 36:00.506
is to shoot you both!

36:00.593 --> 36:02.116
Whoa! Wait a minute.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.118
Just wait a minute.
Let's be cool here.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.902
You can't shoot me.

36:05.989 --> 36:10.777
I took out
the Perry Boys for you.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.606
- Ah. Explain.
- They hit your stash house.

36:13.693 --> 36:16.391
I knew where they were hiding
out, so I fixed it.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.699
- As a gesture of goodwill.
- He is lying.

36:19.786 --> 36:23.311
- You weren't there.
- Yes, I was. Ishot them.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.139
That's impossible.
The gun that was used

36:25.226 --> 36:27.402
to kill the Perry Boys
was the same gun

36:27.489 --> 36:29.361
that was used
to shoot Yoli Concepcion.

36:29.448 --> 36:32.233
I know you didn't kill her,
she was your best friend.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.453
Yes, she was.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.717
I loved Yoli. But she
was starting to suspect

36:37.804 --> 36:39.545
that someone
in our unit was dirty.

36:39.632 --> 36:42.809
It was just a matter of time
before she figured it was me.

36:42.896 --> 36:43.984
Yoli was five-o?

36:45.507 --> 36:46.682
Damn.

36:46.769 --> 36:49.381
[Jane]
'That's a touching story.'

36:49.468 --> 36:50.904
There's just
one problem with it.

36:52.601 --> 36:55.256
I killed Yoli,
and I killed the Perry Boys.

36:57.345 --> 36:58.520
I did 'em all.

37:01.175 --> 37:05.353
Eenie meenie miney mo, hmm?

37:05.440 --> 37:07.834
Catch a liar by the toe.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.924
If they holler, let them go.

37:11.011 --> 37:14.014
Eenie meenie miney...mo.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.107
[Rigsby]
CBI! Drop the weapon now!

37:20.194 --> 37:22.631
Everybody face down
on the ground now!

37:22.718 --> 37:23.893
Don't even think about it.

37:25.504 --> 37:26.679
[Rigsby]
'Yoli!'

37:26.766 --> 37:27.767
'Don't move.'

37:29.334 --> 37:30.770
Anyone happen
to see my shoes?

37:33.120 --> 37:36.384
So, you're the one
who helped the Perrys

37:36.471 --> 37:38.299
steal Vega's cocaine.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.692
That's right.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.998
When Yoli suspected
a dirty cop was behind it

37:42.085 --> 37:43.522
why didn't she
come to me?

37:43.609 --> 37:45.045
You're a bureaucrat.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.829
Me and Yoli,
we came up together.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.484
I was the one that sh--

37:49.571 --> 37:51.269
I was the one she trusted most.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.966
Look what it got her.

37:53.053 --> 37:56.230
And you framed the Perry Boys
for Yoli's murder.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.233
That's why you sent her the text
messages in code.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.802
It was easy to get Yoli on that.
I told her if there was

38:02.889 --> 38:05.326
a dirty cop on our team,
we should use code

38:05.413 --> 38:08.198
so we didn't tip 'em off.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.810
[Bianca]  The champagne text meant that I was in trouble.

38:10.897 --> 38:14.814
Once I sent it, I had to wait for her to show up at her car.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.078
[intense music]

38:21.908 --> 38:25.041
You worked so hard to
frame them for Yoli's murder

38:25.128 --> 38:28.088
and then you killed them
with the same gun?

38:28.175 --> 38:30.569
Yeah, that part
wasn't planned.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.875
I went to the Perry's
to split our take.

38:32.962 --> 38:34.442
They wanted to revise
the deal.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.792
Told me I had
to take a reduced cut.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.839
Told me they'd drop dime on me
if I didn't give in.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.538
I didn't give in.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.584
I guess you showed them.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.150
You don't get it.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.717
Suits never do.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.023
Try me.

38:52.634 --> 38:55.637
I been in narcotics
my whole career.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.335
Bustin' punks like the Perrys

38:57.422 --> 39:01.034
that got more money in their
pockets than I make in a year.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.078
It never ends.

39:03.689 --> 39:07.736
So why try to beat 'em
when you can just join 'em?

39:07.823 --> 39:09.738
Well, now you can
join 'em in prison.

39:18.921 --> 39:19.879
Thank you.

39:21.489 --> 39:22.403
hey.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.494
What do you want?

39:26.581 --> 39:27.887
Feeling bad now?

39:27.974 --> 39:30.150
Roughed up
the down-on-her-luck call girl?

39:30.237 --> 39:31.804
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.852
I wanna use you.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.854
Oh, be still
my beating heart.

39:38.941 --> 39:39.942
Yes or no?

39:41.770 --> 39:43.381
Okay.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.993
Don't expect just because you're
a cop, you get a discount.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.039
- Standard rates apply.
- Not for sex.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.780
For information.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.521
I can use a good
confidential informant.

39:58.657 --> 39:59.832
Cash money, right?

40:01.094 --> 40:02.051
Right.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.315
You know, Cho,
I like you.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.668
You got a mysterious,
feline vibe.

40:09.755 --> 40:10.756
Is that a "yes"?

40:12.235 --> 40:14.586
Kimball..

40:14.673 --> 40:16.588
...for cash money,
I'd snitch on my mom.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.421
What'd she do?

40:27.120 --> 40:29.339
You got paper to sign, or what?

40:31.211 --> 40:33.735
[instrumental music]

40:39.611 --> 40:40.612
Oh, hey!

40:42.440 --> 40:45.312
You don't look worse for wear
after your showdown with Vega.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.575
Oh, I'm fine, apart
from a couple of holes

40:47.662 --> 40:49.272
in my socks
from tap dancing.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.318
You were right.
Your offer to Vega helped

40:51.405 --> 40:54.103
flush out the real killer.
How'd you know it was Bianca?

40:54.190 --> 40:55.627
Well, unlike her co-workers

40:55.714 --> 40:58.107
Bianca never took off
her criminal disguise.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.457
So it was a guess.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.589
Ah, you make it
sound so artless.

41:01.676 --> 41:02.677
- It's time.
- For what?

41:03.896 --> 41:05.593
We need to talk
about Red John.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.813
Oh. Grieving widower
at my 12:00.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.208
Your 6:30.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.428
- Agent Lisbon?
- Hi. Can I help you?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.212
I'm looking for
the evidence room.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.258
They're releasing
Yoli's things.

41:18.345 --> 41:19.694
It's downstairs
two levels.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.002
Sir?

41:25.918 --> 41:27.702
Your wife's
undercover assignment

41:27.789 --> 41:29.791
was to help take down
Omar Vega,

41:29.878 --> 41:31.401
a drug dealer wanted
in connection

41:31.489 --> 41:32.490
with multiple murders.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.406
With what we learned
from Yoli

41:36.494 --> 41:38.800
we found Vega's operation
last night

41:38.887 --> 41:41.803
and we arrested him
with 20 pounds of cocaine.

41:41.890 --> 41:44.284
I doubt he'll ever set foot
on the streets again.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.462
Yoli saved
a lot of lives.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.507
Thank you...

41:50.377 --> 41:51.334
I guess.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.915
