WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:02.592
Previously on Elementary...
I'm gonna find and stop

00:02.630 --> 00:04.029
whoever tried to kill you.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.765
There's a manhunt on
for an escaped prisoner

00:05.800 --> 00:09.236
named Ruslan Krasnov.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.465
Ruslan is just the trigger man,
he's not the architect

00:11.510 --> 00:13.102
of the assassination
attempt.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.631
We've dealt with this
organization before, Watson.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.342
It was run by Moriarty.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.348
Murderous psychopaths are being
wielded like surgical tools.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.813
International energy markets
are being manipulated

00:27.860 --> 00:30.124
by the same dark forces
that made an attempt

00:30.160 --> 00:31.559
on my father's life.

00:31.590 --> 00:34.423
And I have no idea
who is responsible.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.491
That's the good news.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.360
We can now officially eliminate
the most sinister suspect.

00:45.410 --> 00:48.436
Jamie Moriarty is not
pulling these strings.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.670
Are you talking to me?

00:52.720 --> 00:54.210
You left?

00:54.250 --> 00:56.241
Well, you hadn't said anything
to me in almost an hour.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.850
It seemed like you wanted
to be alone with her letters.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.482
I was not lost in reverie.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.249
I was looking for patterns
in our correspondence,

01:02.290 --> 01:05.555
charting the timeline
of recent events.

01:05.590 --> 01:10.129
I have to be sure
that she's not behind all this.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.263
She puts dates
in her little love notes?

01:12.300 --> 01:14.461
No. I do.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.606
I log all of our correspondence
for precisely this reason.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.801
According to her jailors,
I am far and away

01:19.840 --> 01:21.273
her most frequent pen pal.

01:21.310 --> 01:23.301
She'll jot the odd note
to her lawyer,

01:23.350 --> 01:25.306
cousin, childhood friend,

01:25.350 --> 01:27.170
but rarely without
writing to me as well.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.643
_ So even if all her other
mIsswes were densely packed

01:29.690 --> 01:30.839
with coded instructions,

01:30.890 --> 01:32.517
I know the timing
is incompatible.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.414
You're sure?

01:34.460 --> 01:35.813
I don't doubt her ability

01:35.860 --> 01:38.420
to make bold moves
through proxres,

01:38.460 --> 01:41.156
but I'm telling you, she lacks
the lines of communications

01:41.200 --> 01:42.121
to be so prolific.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.229
There is another reason
for this recent spree.

01:46.170 --> 01:48.297
Someone else has taken over.

01:48.340 --> 01:50.160
That's what you said
at the station.

01:52.210 --> 01:54.201
what you think
this person took over.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.673
Her apparatus.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.302
Her Rolodex.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.547
Her job,
for want of a better word.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.719
Moriarty wasn't the Vice
President of Inhuman Resources.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.286
She didn't fill a job
at a corporation

02:04.320 --> 02:05.742
that trades on the NASDAQ.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.509
Her enterprise wasn't even
a proper cartel.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.925
It was more a collection of

02:09.960 --> 02:11.689
compromised
intelligence analysts,

02:11.730 --> 02:15.257
corporate officers,
violent thugs.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.369
Exactly.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.459
No one had to step
into her shoes.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.764
Yet I should have anticipated
that someone would.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.301
I lost sight

02:22.340 --> 02:23.932
of an elemental truth, Watson.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.507
Nature abhors a vacuum.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.447
Say you're right.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.277
Yes, let's, since I am.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.312
A few years ago,
your father made an enemy

02:33.350 --> 02:35.272
out of someone
as powerful as Moriarty.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.811
Presumably, his business got
in the way of their business.

02:37.850 --> 02:39.750
So they sent an assassin
after him in Paris.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.553
Because they could.

02:41.590 --> 02:44.650
All the more reason to bring the
captain into the loop, right?

02:44.690 --> 02:46.351
Maybe the NSA and the FBI, too?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.958
We will tell no one.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.719
We are hunting an individual
with tremendous resources,

02:50.770 --> 02:53.330
international reach_
and a total lack of conSCIence.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.258
Our only advantage
is that this person

02:55.300 --> 02:56.961
might not know that their
existence has been detected,

02:57.010 --> 02:58.409
so why give that away?

02:58.440 --> 02:59.930
So there's no one you trust?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.868
I trust you.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.798
Everyone else, we'll be
doing them a favor.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.806
If this foe is anything
like their predecessor,

03:05.850 --> 03:09.388
they won't hesitate to kill
anyone on their trail.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.539
(knock on door)

03:11.590 --> 03:13.251
ALLISON:
I'm sorry.

03:13.290 --> 03:14.848
There was nobody
at Jessica's desk.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.687
I sent everyone else home.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.527
I have to leave myself.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.357
But I thought you could favor me

03:20.400 --> 03:22.721
with a quick update on
our Asian operations.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.362
Big news is Turretson Global

03:24.400 --> 03:26.391
is close to giving us
their business in Pakistan.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.738
They're checking comps,
asking about our retainer.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.408
Don't close for
less than 60.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.476
Where are the Malaysians
on infrastructure?

03:32.510 --> 03:35.274
Obviously, the projections are
good, but if we keep getting

03:35.310 --> 03:36.868
jammed up on water rights,
it's a moot point.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.468
I'll speak to Rajiv
in the morning.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.875
Was there anything else?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.343
We're clear here, sir.
Car's coming up now.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.345
You've got quite an entourage
these days.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.379
Is everything all right?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.951
No, Allison, it's not.

03:48.990 --> 03:50.457
I asked you to get me

03:50.490 --> 03:52.253
competitive bids
on all the projects

03:52.300 --> 03:53.892
that Emil Kurtz was working on.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.522
I still don't
have that report.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.460
I'll have it for you
in the morning.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.491
Good, then.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.388
Excuse me, what
are you doing?
What?

04:17.420 --> 04:18.682
Where's your escort?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.585
You're not supposed to be
up here alone.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.749
(silenced gunshots)

04:43.710 --> 04:46.645
(steady beeping)

04:46.680 --> 04:48.671
*

05:15.580 --> 05:17.571
*

05:22.720 --> 05:24.415
*

05:56.820 --> 05:58.811
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

06:02.490 --> 06:04.458
(camera clicking)

06:04.490 --> 06:06.549
Anything?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.522
I got an ID.
on the other victim.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.595
Allison Pitzker.
She was a VP here.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.598
Probably working late.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.531
Don't suppose CSU is optimistic
about forensics up there.

06:14.570 --> 06:16.868
That's another thing
I hate about bombs.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.559
They don't leave
much useful evidence.

06:18.610 --> 06:19.907
Well, neither do
trained mercenaries.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.602
The guy who did this
put two .38 super rounds

06:22.650 --> 06:24.447
right through
the guard's heart.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.674
Practically on
top of each other.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.678
Took the surveillance footage,
too.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.484
People this good
don't always get found.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.921
(siren whoops in distance)

06:42.570 --> 06:44.526
Fire department
wants us to clear out.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.629
They don't like the look of
a couple of beams up there

06:46.670 --> 06:48.729
that got damaged
by the blast.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.431
No reason to risk it.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.631
We're striking out in there.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.636
Did the canvass
turn up any wntnesses?

06:54.680 --> 06:55.931
No. Nobody saw a thing.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.505
Frankly,
I didn't have high hopes.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.609
It was late, but I thought
there'd be some video.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.641
Pretty swank address.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.782
Got to_ be a dozen
security cameras

07:03.820 --> 07:05.481
up and down this block, no?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.488
Well, we checked every
building on the street.

07:07.520 --> 07:08.987
It's as if someone
went around

07:09.020 --> 07:11.056
aiming all the cameras
away from this building.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.626
I wouldn't necessarily
give the bomber credit for that.

07:12.660 --> 07:13.558
Knowing Morland,

07:13.600 --> 07:14.999
he probably paid people

07:15.030 --> 07:16.861
to turn their lenses
away from hIs busmess.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.629
BELL:
Well, that's great.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.228
We don't get to see
the bomber coming and going

07:20.270 --> 07:21.737
'cause Mr. Holmes's clients
don't want to be seen

07:21.770 --> 07:22.737
coming and going?

07:22.770 --> 07:24.237
All of them are those
corporate vampire types.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.567
Half of them probably

07:25.610 --> 07:28.170
wouldn't even
show up on fIlm.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.802
BELL: Obviously,
someone he tangled with

07:29.850 --> 07:31.738
has it out for him.
First, they kill his guy, Kurtz,

07:31.780 --> 07:32.917
now this?

07:32.950 --> 07:34.144
GREGSON:
Where'd your partner go?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.511
He took one look around,

07:35.550 --> 07:36.687
and he was gone.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.244
You guys have a suspect in mind?

07:38.290 --> 07:40.087
No. He just wanted
to get ahold of his father,

07:40.120 --> 07:41.849
make sure he was okay.
He's fine.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.825
We finally got ahold of one
of his people a few minutes ago.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.192
Apparently,
he's in Malaysia on business.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.652
Sherlock didn't know?

07:49.730 --> 07:51.561
No. They don't talk much.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.101
BODYGUARD:
Clear.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.510
How long do you expect
me to cower here?

08:06.550 --> 08:08.074
I'm bringing on
more people, sir.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.612
You'll be able to resume your
schedule in a couple of days.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.810
Until then?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.816
Nobody knows about this place.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.179
We'd like to
keep it that way.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.688
That means no calls,
and no computers.

08:18.730 --> 08:19.992
It's all clear.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.123
Both of you find
somewhere else to be.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.761
(doorbell rings)

08:33.680 --> 08:34.977
HOLMES:
Don't point your guns at me.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.705
I just want to talk
to my father.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.684
You really expect me to believe
you'd gone to Malaysia?

08:51.730 --> 08:53.823
How did you know
to find me here?

08:53.860 --> 08:56.055
I'm glad I still have the
capacity to surprise you.

08:56.100 --> 08:56.896
It's not mutual.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.591
I need to speak to you
in private.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.900
Pveidenﬁﬁed
the party

09:03.940 --> 09:06.261
you've been warring with
these last few months.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.232
Who is it?

09:08.280 --> 09:09.747
It's not a who.
It's a what.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.600
You're in more danger
than you realize.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.753
I like to think
of myself as a person

09:19.790 --> 09:21.815
who understands
how the world works,

09:21.860 --> 09:25.728
but this organization
you described,

09:25.760 --> 09:28.149
I've never considered
the possibility of such a thing.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.758
Well, lack of
imagination

09:29.800 --> 09:31.893
is an occupational hazard
for an apex predator.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.795
A great white shark
doesn't live in fear

09:33.840 --> 09:35.137
of shadows in the
deep, does it?

09:35.170 --> 09:39.834
You say this group
once had a leader, Moriarty.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.769
Well, now that
she's off the board,

09:42.810 --> 09:44.107
who leads them now?

09:44.150 --> 09:46.846
I'm attempting to find out.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.146
So this group tried to kill you
several years ago, failed.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.658
They set off a bomb
in your office last night,

09:53.690 --> 09:55.282
but only after you'd left.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.924
So are we to assume
that they're

09:56.960 --> 09:58.848
less angry with you now
than they were then?

09:58.890 --> 10:01.859
No, I read the bomb
as a shot across the bow.

10:01.900 --> 10:04.869
Final warning
to stop my investigation

10:04.900 --> 10:06.788
into Sabine's death.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.729
And as an added bonus,
I've been running for cover.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.839
My resources are tied up

10:10.870 --> 10:12.269
in police,
insurance companies,

10:12.310 --> 10:14.733
the grieving relatives
of my employees.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.647
But it has given me time
to consider

10:17.680 --> 10:19.341
just how far I'm willing to go.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.042
It's a worthwhile question.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.219
Have you ever known me
to be intimidated?

10:24.250 --> 10:25.842
I'm not here to
counsel surrender.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.653
Just that you proceed
with caution.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.385
The depravity
of these people is unmatched.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.354
We'll see.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.352
So I don't blame
you for keeping

10:35.400 --> 10:37.163
Watson and me
at arm's length.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.293
But now is the time
to let us in.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.298
If for no other reason
than you might not live

10:41.340 --> 10:43.205
to see this through.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.901
You'll keep me apprised of

10:44.940 --> 10:46.908
any leads that you
and the police may develop?

10:46.940 --> 10:49.670
You have my word.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.747
I believe
the bomb was planted

10:52.780 --> 10:56.375
by the same man
who killed Sabine.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.881
Ruslan Krasnov.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.825
Last I heard,
he was in Russia.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.794
An escaped prisoner
on the lam.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.092
You have proof
he's even alive?

11:09.130 --> 11:10.097
I used to.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.394
It was destroyed.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.763
I had his left thumb
in a jar in my office.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.803
Krasnov cut it off himself.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.308
He did it to wriggle
out of his shackles

11:21.340 --> 11:22.978
so he could escape his cell.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.409
When I accused the warden

11:24.450 --> 11:26.839
of orchestrating
the breakout himself, he...

11:26.880 --> 11:29.474
Sent it to you,
prove he wasn't complicit.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.011
I expended
a small fortune

11:32.050 --> 11:35.759
making friends in
the hinterlands around Novgorod.

11:35.790 --> 11:38.850
But Krasnov
had a better connected ally.

11:38.890 --> 11:41.290
Presumably someone that didn't
want me speaking to him.

11:41.330 --> 11:44.993
This person helped him get
to the port in Tallinn, Estonia.

11:45.030 --> 11:46.361
And he caught a ship.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.938
An oil tanker
owned by Rixar Energy.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.961
But I only
found out last week,

11:52.010 --> 11:54.103
two days after
the ship clocked in Newark.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.200
And you think now he's gone back
to work for his old employer,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.979
who tried to kill you
all those years ago.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.012
So it would seem.

12:01.050 --> 12:03.109
I'll be in touch.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.447
Stay here where it's safe.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.446
I'm not made of glass, son.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.117
If you leave, you
invite the possibility

12:08.160 --> 12:09.821
of more
collateral damage.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.521
Let's let the two_
murders at your office

12:11.560 --> 12:13.755
be the last, shall we?

12:22.100 --> 12:23.965
Sherlock?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.001
SHERLOCK:
Kitchen!

12:28.010 --> 12:30.001
(sighs)

12:42.960 --> 12:45.929
Watson. Watson.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.996
You look pleased with yourself.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.793
I was just beating up Bob.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.991
Nothing better for elevating
one's heart rate and mood.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.338
I could use some
of that myself.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.565
I spent the day
running into walls.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.238
Lying to our friends.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.977
It looks like your day was
a little more productive.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.500
That's a fair wager.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.871
Where did this come from?

13:02.910 --> 13:04.002
It's on loan
from the authorities.

13:04.050 --> 13:04.800
You get my message?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.374
That Krasnov's
in New York, yeah.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.547
I told the Captain
what you said,

13:07.580 --> 13:08.911
that your father
thought Krasnov

13:08.950 --> 13:10.144
was our best suspect.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.839
I figured ﬁnding him
would be job one,

13:11.890 --> 13:14.085
but this makes me think you've
got something else in mind.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.519
Krasnov is a means to an end.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.357
We want to know
who he's working for.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.927
According to my father,
that person orchestrated

13:19.960 --> 13:21.951
Krasnov's journey
to the United States

13:22.000 --> 13:24.594
by facilitating the help
of Rixar Energy.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.564
All in all,
three different oil companies

13:26.600 --> 13:28.864
have been manipulated
by Moriarty's successor

13:31.070 --> 13:32.879
So you went looking
for overlap between

13:32.910 --> 13:34.070
three companies'
board members.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.577
This Venn diagram
has yielded

13:35.610 --> 13:38.374
a rogue's gallery
of corporate toadies,

13:38.410 --> 13:40.549
but they're all too old,
too dumb

13:40.580 --> 13:43.549
or too diseased to helm
a proper global conspiracy.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.945
So you spent the day crossing
old fogies off the list.

13:45.990 --> 13:48.458
No, they're not all old.
And they're not all crossed off.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.357
Who is Joshua Vikner?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.992
Economics professor.

13:56.030 --> 13:57.566
He's currently
teaching in New York,

13:57.600 --> 14:00.068
but he has hopscotched
all over the Ivy League

14:00.100 --> 14:01.897
and Oxbridge Colleges.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.202
To supplement his income,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.868
he makes paid speeches
to energy companies,

14:05.910 --> 14:08.378
including all three of the
conglomerates that I looked at.

14:08.410 --> 14:11.072
"Profit, Conscience and Law
in Developing Markets,"

14:11.110 --> 14:14.147
an address to Rixar's_
annual shareholder meeting.

14:14.180 --> 14:18.048
So he gives pep talks to oil
barons and their buddies.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.183
Not the most noble way
to pay the bills,

14:20.220 --> 14:21.983
but it does explain
why he'd cross

14:22.020 --> 14:23.988
with all these companies.
It's an explanation.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.486
It's not _
the whole explanation.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.191
I'm quite certain
Professor Vi kner

14:27.230 --> 14:29.528
_ is a murderous
international criminal

14:29.560 --> 14:31.892
and the heir to Jamie Moriarty's
fetid throne.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.531
I much prefer the photograph
inside this dust jacket

14:35.570 --> 14:37.367
to_ the _one he uses
for his paid appearances.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.365
It's older,

14:38.410 --> 14:39.934
but it's much more
revealing.

14:41.110 --> 14:42.634
That painting behind him,

14:42.680 --> 14:44.045
it's a Vermeer.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.399
Of sorts.

14:45.450 --> 14:47.077
It's a rather impressive
reimagining

14:47.120 --> 14:48.644
of one of
the Dutch master's

14:48.680 --> 14:51.046
famed lost canvases.
Okay.

14:51.090 --> 14:54.082
Now, when I still knew Moriarty
as Irene Adler,

14:54.120 --> 14:56.259
we had a rather interesting
conversation about Vermeer.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.485
About the problems
that she encountered

14:59.530 --> 15:01.657
trying to reproduce his work.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.964
That's why you asked
for her painting.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.490
I've been studying her work.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.589
Her brushstrokes,
her use of light.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.962
I'd have to see
the pseudo Vermeer to be sure,

15:11.010 --> 15:14.002
but I strongly suspect that she
gave that painting to Vikner,

15:14.040 --> 15:15.974
as well as the keys
to her kingdom.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.171
*

15:28.720 --> 15:31.154
(keys jingling)

15:33.530 --> 15:35.259
Professor Vi kner,
good morning.

15:35.300 --> 15:38.292
Sherlock Holmes.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.422
Dr. Watson.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.359
What took you so long?

15:55.120 --> 15:58.442
I teach here sometimes,
when the weather is nice.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.185
Today is nice.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.482
Teach us.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.125
Tell us how and when
you took over

16:04.160 --> 16:06.287
Moriarty's organization.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.150
So you don't deny it?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.622
To you?

16:09.660 --> 16:11.059
What would be the point?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.727
How do you know about us?

16:12.770 --> 16:16.592
Even if you weren't responsible
for what happened to her,

16:16.640 --> 16:18.631
well, you're the son
of Morland Holmes.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.171
Your enemy.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.599
Well, he's been turning over
certain rocks.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.449
So you set a bomb off

16:24.480 --> 16:26.141
in his New York office--
that makes sense to me.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.047
Joshua Vikner,
born 1969.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.718
You attended Eton and Oxford

16:30.750 --> 16:33.082
before completing
a double doctorate in Economics

16:33.120 --> 16:35.213
and Political Science.
You currently hold

16:35.260 --> 16:36.409
_an endowed chair
in Economics here.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.552
And you serve as

16:37.590 --> 16:40.252
senior advisor to the UN
Fund for Developing Nations.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.256
I would say
that was a brilliant cover,

16:42.300 --> 16:44.120
except it's not a cover;
you really are

16:44.170 --> 16:46.263
a professor,
and you really are at the helm

16:46.300 --> 16:49.167
of an organization
which is steeped in blood.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.065
My predecessor was a painter.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.600
So was Hitler.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.677
My point is that this job
that you're describing

16:55.710 --> 16:57.746
doesn't come with prerequisites.

16:57.780 --> 17:00.112
All you need
is an eye for opportunity.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.641
And Moriarty's detention
was your opportunity.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.488
Are you familiar
with The Invisible Hand?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.215
It's a metaphor

17:08.260 --> 17:10.319
used by Adam Smith
to describe social benefits

17:10.360 --> 17:12.555
arising from individual actions.

17:12.590 --> 17:14.649
Are you suggesting
that you're an invisible hand?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.726
Because if you can explain to
me how blowing up buildings

17:17.770 --> 17:19.499
and turning psychopaths
into assassins

17:19.530 --> 17:21.134
is benefitting society,
I might register

17:21.170 --> 17:22.239
for one of your classes.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.205
When Jamie went away,
there was chaos.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.834
Alliances she helped forge
fell apart.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.246
Our best people
were fighting themselves.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.840
I brought order, stability.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.518
How did you two know each other?

17:34.550 --> 17:35.676
She never
mentioned you.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.347
She and I were quite close.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.687
I know.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.518
But she and I
were close once, too.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.484
You're her daughter's father.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.129
You found me.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.593
But I want you to know
I bear you no ill will.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.096
Nor does anyone I oversee.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.267
You're untouchable.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.608
What does that mean?

18:01.640 --> 18:04.143
Well, years ago,
Jamie made it clear

18:04.180 --> 18:06.876
that you were
not to be harmed. Ever.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.344
Well, the same courtesy
has been extended to you.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.317
Though I'm not
entirely sure why.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.158
We are responsible
for her incarceration.

18:16.190 --> 18:20.354
Do you think that makes you
less fascinating to her?

18:21.660 --> 18:23.321
Say we believe you.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.689
We're not the ones
in danger; you are.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.527
Several years ago,

18:26.570 --> 18:28.197
you started a war
with my father,

18:28.240 --> 18:32.165
and that's rapidly
reaching its denouement.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.178
If you confess
to bombing his office building,

18:34.210 --> 18:38.374
we can see to it that you are
protected from any reprisals.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.277
That's very generous of you.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.242
I'll think about it.

18:45.620 --> 18:48.214
Right now I have
a class to teach.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.591
Uh, before you go,
look at your hand.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.438
Not invisible anymore.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.209
WATSON:
That was weird.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.277
Did you expect him
to just surrender himself?

19:12.310 --> 19:14.312
No. I mean the whole
Moriarty thing.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.476
You, him, her.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.669
Are you 12 years old?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.210
I mean, I know
she had a kid.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.387
I just figured the
father would be...

19:19.420 --> 19:20.352
More like me?

19:20.390 --> 19:21.789
Less like her.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.253
She was young
when she had her daughter.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.587
Perhaps she felt the need

19:24.630 --> 19:26.325
to seduce him
on her rise to power,

19:26.360 --> 19:28.692
or theirs
was a love for the ages.

19:28.730 --> 19:30.493
Neither scenario changes
what we have to do now.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.623
I notice you didn't mention
anything about Krasnov.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.399
You don't want him to know
that we know

19:34.440 --> 19:35.930
that he was the one
who set off the bomb.

19:35.970 --> 19:39.360
Why tempt him to disappear
his favorite assassin?

19:39.410 --> 19:41.275
If we can find Krasnov
and connect him to Vikner...

19:41.310 --> 19:43.471
We'll have them both.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.307
The police know about Krasnov.
How do we explain Vikner?

19:45.350 --> 19:46.305
We don't.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.612
My father has ears everywhere.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.641
We keep the name Joshua Vikner
to ourselves for now.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.511
The last thing we need
is more bloodshed.

19:53.390 --> 19:56.655
Bomb squad's preliminary report,
hot off the presses.

19:56.690 --> 19:59.557
The device was a homemade rig,
detonated by a remote trigger,

19:59.590 --> 20:00.818
most likely a cell phone.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.623
They're looking through

20:02.660 --> 20:05.265
some electronics that may have
been part of the detonator.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.336
Any luck, they'll be able
to pull a phone number

20:07.370 --> 20:09.668
that points
to the Russian you two like.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.634
Bomb's primary ingredients
were acetone and peroxide.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.399
Two liquids.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.874
Acetone and peroxide--
those are just fancy names

20:15.910 --> 20:17.468
for nail polish remover
and hair dye.

20:17.510 --> 20:19.375
You can pick that up
at any supermarket.

20:19.410 --> 20:21.412
We're pulling sales records
from local drugstores

20:21.450 --> 20:22.712
and chemical supply companies,

20:22.750 --> 20:23.978
looking for
suspicious purchases.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.648
So far, nothing's
turned up.

20:26.690 --> 20:28.317
So how much liquid explosive

20:28.360 --> 20:30.578
would it take to do
this kind of damage?

20:30.630 --> 20:33.599
Bomb squad estimates
between ten and 20 gallons.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.495
Can't imagine
20 gallons of anything

20:35.530 --> 20:38.567
getting into Morland's office
without someone noticing it.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.828
Pretty sure someone did notice.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.360
The two victims
were shot and killed

20:41.400 --> 20:43.368
before the bomb exploded,
remember?

20:43.410 --> 20:46.299
Yeah, but the security
at this building was tight.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.275
The guard's desk was less than
40 feet from the entrance.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.449
If he saw anything suspicious
come through that door,

20:51.480 --> 20:52.845
he would have hit
the silent alarm.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.438
You think the bomb
was disguised.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.038
Well, how do
you camouflage

20:56.080 --> 20:57.445
20 gallons of explosive liquid?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.412
I can think of a way.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.757
Yeah, yeah,
you're right.

21:02.790 --> 21:04.485
We-we were supposed
to make a delivery

21:04.530 --> 21:05.519
to that address
two nights ago.

21:05.560 --> 21:06.959
Supposed to?

21:06.990 --> 21:09.493
George-- the guy
that works that route--

21:09.530 --> 21:11.327
his truck went missing
that night.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.928
It was stolen?
Well, sort of.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.938
See, he-he pulled over
to get some food,

21:14.970 --> 21:17.530
and when he came out of the
restaurant, his truck was gone.

21:18.670 --> 21:19.830
to call the cops, and he waited

21:19.870 --> 21:21.371
at the counter
for them to get there.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.707
But by the time they got there,

21:22.740 --> 21:25.402
the truck was back, and it was
parked in the same spot.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.338
Now, nothing was damaged,
nothing was missing,

21:27.380 --> 21:29.348
so the cops just chalked it up
to a prank.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.041
Y-You know, kids.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.354
But you think the truck
was used to deliver a bomb?

21:33.390 --> 21:35.358
We think the explosives
were in jugs like those.

21:35.390 --> 21:36.880
One of your trucks
and one of your uniforms

21:36.920 --> 21:38.478
would have gone a long way

21:38.530 --> 21:39.326
towards getting them
into the building.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.156
BELL: The restaurant
George went to,

21:40.190 --> 21:42.420
do you happen to know
if they have

21:42.460 --> 21:43.620
security cameras
in their parking lot?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.524
Well, he and the cops
both asked,

21:45.570 --> 21:47.299
but place had nothing.

21:48.370 --> 21:49.530
You know,
the day after it happened,

21:49.570 --> 21:51.003
George had said
that he wished he could find

21:51.040 --> 21:52.268
those little punks
that took the truck

21:52.310 --> 21:55.507
because he wanted to thank them,
because if it wasn't for them,

21:55.540 --> 21:56.871
he would've been there
when the bomb went off.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.571
We just didn't put
two and two together.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.544
Where's the vehicle now?
It's out back.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.774
You want to see it?

22:13.860 --> 22:15.896
Windshield is covered
in soot particles.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.761
Residue from the explosion,
no doubt.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.529
Would've had to been
parked pretty close

22:19.570 --> 22:21.492
to get soot from the
explosion on the windshield.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.428
Our bomber must
like to watch.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.961
Do all the trucks
have two of these.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.432
Some. Why?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.435
Well, this one looks like

22:28.480 --> 22:29.902
it's been here forever,

22:29.940 --> 22:31.646
and this one looks like
it's brand new.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.773
Is that important?

22:33.820 --> 22:35.139
WATSON:
It is if it means this one

22:35.180 --> 22:37.512
used to have
a bomb strapped to it.

22:37.550 --> 22:40.587
Kras_nov would not have
risked assembling

22:40.620 --> 22:42.759
an explosive device in
the back of a water truck.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.621
He would have prepared it
and strapped it

22:44.660 --> 22:46.582
to the hand truck in advance.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.518
Hmm. It does look new.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.960
If he bought it in
the last few days, it's a lead,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.490
but there's got to be
hundreds of places

22:52.530 --> 22:53.292
that sell these things.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.036
How many of them
are having a sale

22:55.070 --> 22:56.435
on this kind
of hand truck though?

22:56.470 --> 22:59.564
Two UPC stickers.

22:59.610 --> 23:00.872
Indicates change of price.

23:00.910 --> 23:03.572
Find the store
selling that hand truck

23:03.610 --> 23:05.077
at that specific price...

23:05.110 --> 23:07.647
And we may find clues
to Krasnov's location.

23:16.460 --> 23:17.688
Well, that was Marcus.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.584
Turns out, the card
that Krasnov used

23:19.630 --> 23:21.757
at the hardware store
was a gift card,

23:21.800 --> 23:24.189
like the kind that you
can buy at supermarkets.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.766
HOLMES:
Here I was hoping he'd use

23:25.800 --> 23:27.688
his own card_
to accumulate miles.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.868
He was probably given dozens
of those by his employer.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.639
Yeah, well,
the good news is,

23:32.670 --> 23:33.705
the card number
can be tracked.

23:33.740 --> 23:34.729
The police were able

23:34.780 --> 23:36.031
to identify a few other places

23:36.080 --> 23:37.479
where the card was used.

23:37.510 --> 23:39.205
Most of the charges were
in a section of Queens

23:39.250 --> 23:41.047
where there are a couple
of no-tell motels.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.741
With any luck,
they'll find him in one.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.213
If he was Moriarty's agent,
she'd have him

23:44.250 --> 23:45.740
on the other side
of the globe by now.

23:45.790 --> 23:47.883
Yeah, well, she probably
wouldn't have given him

23:47.920 --> 23:49.478
a bunch of gift cards either.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.124
I mean,
Vikner may have her job,

23:51.160 --> 23:53.799
but it doesn't mean
he's as good at it as she was.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.828
What?

23:56.860 --> 23:59.590
That's the first time you've
ever paid her a compliment.

23:59.630 --> 24:02.497
She also had great taste
in shoes. Happy?

24:02.540 --> 24:03.802
(doorbell rings)

24:03.840 --> 24:05.569
You expecting someone?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.601
You could say that.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.874
Father.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.719
What a surprise.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.685
Police apparently

24:17.720 --> 24:20.985
are hot on the trail
of Ruslan Krasnov.

24:21.020 --> 24:23.056
Obviously, you heard from
one of your sources.

24:23.090 --> 24:25.684
I was just telling Watson
this morning...

24:25.730 --> 24:27.083
You said that you would
keep me apprised

24:27.130 --> 24:29.018
of any new developments.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.254
You gave me your word.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.598
Yes. I went back on it.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.632
It's obvious that you
mean Krasnov harm.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.069
I can't let that happen.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.660
I only intended to convince him

24:38.710 --> 24:40.928
to give me the name
of his employer.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.006
Well, by "convince,"
you mean "torture."

24:44.050 --> 24:45.540
I-I could get
behind that,

24:45.580 --> 24:47.878
but then what would
you do to him?

24:47.920 --> 24:50.070
To the man who gunned
down your great love,

24:50.120 --> 24:51.712
bombed your
office building.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.217
Let him off
with a warning?

24:53.250 --> 24:54.956
No.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.720
He should not be killed, he
should be made to testify.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.024
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Watson and I have got some...

25:00.060 --> 25:01.891
Against whom?
What?

25:01.930 --> 25:05.093
You said he should be
made to testify.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.666
Against whom?

25:06.700 --> 25:09.294
Against whoever
hired him, obviously.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.160
You already know who it is.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.302
I do not.

25:12.340 --> 25:14.501
Stop lying to me, Sherlock!

25:15.980 --> 25:19.541
If you're right, and we're
dealing with an organization

25:19.580 --> 25:21.741
as powerful as the one
you have described,

25:21.780 --> 25:24.180
the NYPD is out of its league.

25:24.220 --> 25:26.711
They were quite helpful
in bringing down Jamie Moriarty.

25:26.750 --> 25:27.785
Oh, were they?

25:27.820 --> 25:29.583
Yes, you cut off the head,

25:29.620 --> 25:31.724
but the rest
of the body remained.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.854
And if it hadn't, perhaps Sabine
would still be alive.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.198
Are you suggesting
it's my fault that she's dead?

25:37.230 --> 25:40.119
In the wake of
this Moriarty's arrest,

25:40.170 --> 25:43.708
did you hunt down
the other members of her group?

25:43.740 --> 25:45.002
Across the country,

25:45.040 --> 25:46.302
across the globe?

25:46.340 --> 25:48.604
Or did you stay here
and lick your wounds?

25:48.640 --> 25:52.576
Perhaps you went off
on another of your binges.

25:52.610 --> 25:55.613
Facing hardship was never
your line of country.

25:55.650 --> 25:57.686
Never mind Sabine.

25:57.720 --> 26:03.078
If not for you, how many other
lives need not have been lost?

26:03.120 --> 26:07.955
You talk all the time
about the blood on my hands.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.560
But how about
the blood on yours?

26:13.670 --> 26:15.137
Give me the name.

26:15.170 --> 26:18.662
When the individual
is brought to justice,

26:18.710 --> 26:20.678
you can read about
it in the paper,

26:20.710 --> 26:23.304
(whispers):
just like everyone else.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.658
Don't drink the camel milk.
It's expired.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.668
At least tell me _
the mopane worms are still okay.

26:43.700 --> 26:44.667
Sadly, no.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.962
Many of my snacks

26:46.000 --> 26:47.831
have gone bad.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.735
What?
Nothing.

26:52.770 --> 26:53.566
Just trying to remember
the last time

26:53.610 --> 26:54.838
I saw you clean up
after yourself.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.201
You and my father, both.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.969
You know I didn't
mean it like that.

26:59.010 --> 27:00.341
Several years ago,

27:00.380 --> 27:01.972
I anticipated
that without Moriarty,

27:02.020 --> 27:03.214
her group would fall apart.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.013
That was a mistake.

27:06.050 --> 27:08.883
You're crazy.
Am I?

27:08.920 --> 27:11.286
Moriarty didn't get locked up
in the county jail.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.218
She was taken into custody
by the U.S. government.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.249
Didn't you think they would

27:14.300 --> 27:15.494
take things from there?

27:15.530 --> 27:18.658
'Cause the American government
always sees things through?

27:20.070 --> 27:21.958
I need to find out
why it happened.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.900
Why what happened?

27:23.940 --> 27:25.669
The attempt on my father's life.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.699
Last night,

27:26.740 --> 27:28.071
he suggested that I was

27:28.110 --> 27:29.429
responsible for
Sabine Raoult's death.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.799
The shooting took place

27:30.850 --> 27:32.875
shortly after
Moriarty was sentenced.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.777
Perhaps her ex-lover, the
professor, wanted to avenge her.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.219
By killing a man

27:37.250 --> 27:38.387
you literally had
no relationship with?

27:38.420 --> 27:39.785
How does that make any sense?

27:39.820 --> 27:41.253
(phone ringing)

27:43.260 --> 27:44.420
Marcus.

27:44.460 --> 27:45.927
MARCUS:
We got Ruslan Krasnov.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.451
Scooped him up outside
a flophouse in Queens.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.821
Thought you and Joan would want
to be here when we talk to him.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.792
No English.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.831
GREGSON: Yeah, you
keep saying that.

27:57.870 --> 28:00.805
But we all saw the video
from the hardware store.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.138
You got along fine
with the guy at the register.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.444
No Eng... lish.

28:07.510 --> 28:11.480
Do you think we're fools,
Mr. Krasnov?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.715
(speaking Russian)

28:19.130 --> 28:20.927
You're an admirer
of Dostoyevsky.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.349
I, myself,
prefer Cicero.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.495
_ You can talk to us
in any language you want,

28:30.540 --> 28:31.905
but you will talk to us.

28:33.310 --> 28:37.007
Police say
I set off a bomb.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.940
Only I know nothing.

28:38.980 --> 28:42.939
I'm here to see New York.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.413
You're a tourist?
For now.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.384
I like it, maybe I stay.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.786
GREGSON:
Trust me, you're staying.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.458
Which prison and for how long

28:50.490 --> 28:53.425
depends on what you say
in this room today.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.451
About?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.456
The person who hired
you to plant that bomb.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.127
GREGSON:
You talk to us,

28:59.170 --> 29:03.368
and I'll talk to the DA.
about cutting you a deal.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.038
An enticing offer.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.872
In the event I'm ever
on trial in this country,

29:08.910 --> 29:09.877
I'll consider it.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.377
Mr. Krasnov...

29:11.410 --> 29:16.814
You have a picture of me
buying a hand truck

29:16.850 --> 29:17.885
that you said

29:17.920 --> 29:19.808
looks like one

29:19.850 --> 29:21.249
used by a bomber.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.828
That's not enough

29:24.860 --> 29:26.157
to charge me.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.556
I'll be leaving
this station by nightfall.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.556
You're a _wanted
fugitive.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.364
In Russia. Not here.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.459
And as I'm sure you're aware,
Captain,

29:35.500 --> 29:39.231
there is no extradition treaty
between my country and yours.

29:39.270 --> 29:41.579
I can't be detained
unless you can prove

29:41.610 --> 29:44.044
I committed a crime
on American SOII.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.946
(chuckles softly)

29:47.980 --> 29:49.379
You cannot.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.019
Last chance, Ruslan.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.383
I'm not ashamed to confess

29:59.430 --> 30:01.557
that I'm ignorant

30:01.600 --> 30:03.454
of what I do not know.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.926
Cicero.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.198
We're wasting our time with him.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.265
Before you return Mr. Krasnov
to holding,

30:10.300 --> 30:12.564
I suggest that he be put on
strict suicide-watch protocol.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.168
It's quite obvious the
long Russian winters

30:14.210 --> 30:15.438
have taken their toll.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.277
He should be relieved
of his belt

30:17.310 --> 30:19.278
and his shoelaces immediately.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.245
You heard the man.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.458
The guy's obviously
not a suicide risk,

30:29.490 --> 30:32.254
so you want to tell us why
you wanted his belt and laces?

30:32.290 --> 30:34.895
The shoelaces would make it
harder for him to walk.

30:34.930 --> 30:36.022
Because why not?

30:36.060 --> 30:37.618
The belt buckle
was the real prize.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.059
How so?
Smell it.

30:41.270 --> 30:42.965
What is it?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.069
Confirmation of something
I suspected

30:44.110 --> 30:45.429
about the bomb he planted.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.199
Given the size of
the blast radius,

30:47.240 --> 30:49.128
it seemed likely that
an additive propellant

30:49.180 --> 30:52.274
was used to enhance
the device's footprint.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.914
The report we read
didn't mention anything

30:53.950 --> 30:55.110
about a propellant.

30:55.150 --> 30:57.311
Probably because it burned up
in the explosion. Most do.

30:57.350 --> 30:58.419
But I now believe
it was a chemical

30:58.450 --> 31:01.908
commonly used in pesticides
called nitroguanidine.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.279
One of the characteristics

31:03.320 --> 31:05.356
of nitroguanidine is a tendency
to corrode metal,

31:05.390 --> 31:06.982
as well_as _
a very distinctive

31:07.030 --> 31:08.998
smell like latex paint.

31:09.030 --> 31:11.021
The condition
of this belt buckle suggests

31:11.070 --> 31:13.368
that Krasnov is responsible not
only for planting the device,

31:13.400 --> 31:15.163
but for building it as well.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.203
Well, "suggests" isn't gonna be
enough to charge him.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.162
No, but unlike the bomb's
other ingredients,

31:20.210 --> 31:21.529
nitroguanidine
cannot be purchased

31:21.580 --> 31:23.036
at just any corner shop.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.002
If we can trace
where it came from,

31:25.050 --> 31:26.540
we might be able
to link him

31:26.580 --> 31:28.218
more directly to the bomb.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.309
Maybe then,
he flips on his boss.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.011
(phone chimes)
Among the various debits

31:32.050 --> 31:34.917
on his, uh, gift card, I noticed
a stop at a sandwich shop

31:34.960 --> 31:37.019
in Dutchess County
several days ago.

31:37.060 --> 31:38.425
Caught our eye, too.
It's a couple hours

31:38.460 --> 31:40.087
north of the city--
nothing but farmland.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.222
Makes one wonder whether

31:41.260 --> 31:42.397
the propellant was distilled

31:42.430 --> 31:44.091
from a pesticide
purchased near there.

31:44.130 --> 31:46.928
I'll make some calls upstate,
see if anyone remembers him.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.096
Watson will assist you.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.994
I have an appointment
I have to keep.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.107
WATSON :
Hey.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.277
You want to tell me
what's more important

31:56.310 --> 31:57.504
than working the case
against Krasnov?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.144
Meeting with his employer.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.375
The professor has requested
the pleasure of my company.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.139
Obviously, he's heard that
we have his man in custody.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.181
You think you should
see him alone?

32:06.220 --> 32:08.154
Well, I'm untouchable, remember?

32:08.190 --> 32:10.112
Anyway, the location he's chosen
will make it very difficult

32:10.160 --> 32:11.354
for him to act against me.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.651
*

32:34.220 --> 32:36.040
(sighs)

32:36.080 --> 32:40.016
I've seen subtler displays
of insensitivity.

32:40.050 --> 32:43.019
Do you attend the wakes
of all of your victims?

32:43.060 --> 32:46.188
I wasn't sure you believed me
the other day

32:46.230 --> 32:49.324
when I said
you wouldn't be harmed.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.568
This struck me as a place
you'd be willing to meet.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.330
There's a... a nice crowd.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.394
Thanks to you.

32:56.440 --> 32:57.998
Or thanks to
your father.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.667
He forced my hand.

32:59.710 --> 33:04.204
Sorry I couldn't bring
our mutual friend, Mr. Krasnov.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.242
He's a much gentler soul
than I'd imagined.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.477
He feels terrible
about what he did.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.112
My colleagues
are looking for a way

33:12.150 --> 33:15.051
for him to atone,
even as we speak.

33:15.090 --> 33:18.457
I shouldn't tell you this,

33:18.490 --> 33:21.129
but you actually
have a shot with Ruslan.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.162
When he was arrested in Russia,
he got a message to me.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.725
He was gonna talk
unless I helped him.

33:27.770 --> 33:30.398
But I didn't come here
to talk about him.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.601
Whom, then?

33:34.510 --> 33:36.068
You.

33:36.110 --> 33:38.806
You caught me
by surprise.

33:38.850 --> 33:43.048
Throwing yourself into
recent affairs with such brio.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.117
Well, Jamie told me years ago
that you were brilliant,

33:46.150 --> 33:49.688
but she also said
that you hated your father.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.757
Did she have that wrong?

33:54.800 --> 33:57.598
No, my relationship
with my father

33:57.630 --> 33:59.359
is really none of your concern.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.096
Obviously, it is.

34:03.140 --> 34:06.268
You seem aligned with him now.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.732
And I can't touch you.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.705
If you really are committed

34:12.750 --> 34:18.108
to helping your father,
I may have to sue for peace.

34:20.290 --> 34:22.383
I can't fight
both Holmes men.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.752
I mean, I could,

34:24.790 --> 34:27.258
but I would win the battle
and lose the war.

34:27.290 --> 34:31.693
You want me to help forge
a truce with my father.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.391
Well, after everything
that's happened,

34:33.430 --> 34:35.796
don't you think
that would be best?

34:35.840 --> 34:39.435
Well, you've been
very forthcoming.

34:39.470 --> 34:42.633
So, tell me, why'd you try
to kill him in the first place?

34:42.680 --> 34:44.477
That was business.

34:44.510 --> 34:45.875
No, it wasn't.

34:45.910 --> 34:48.117
I've _studied that event
in great detail,

34:48.150 --> 34:49.447
and unlike your other plots--

34:49.480 --> 34:51.744
manipulating
Colombian oil futures,

34:51.790 --> 34:55.214
for example--
the upside, it eludes me.

34:55.260 --> 34:59.151
On paper, you had nothing
to gain from his death.

34:59.190 --> 35:01.590
He was unaware of you
or your group.

35:01.630 --> 35:05.293
And in failing, you awoke
this slumbering giant.

35:05.330 --> 35:07.161
So I'd like to know why.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.634
Will you help me or not?

35:09.670 --> 35:14.175
Even if I was in the habit
of letting murderers walk free,

35:14.210 --> 35:18.169
there's really nothing
to be done about my father.

35:18.210 --> 35:20.849
He wants your head.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.246
We all want things.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.487
You crossed a line with him.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.385
There'll be no peace

35:27.420 --> 35:31.356
until you're incarcerated or...

35:31.390 --> 35:33.221
dead.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.289
No peace it is.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.938
What am I looking at here?

35:50.980 --> 35:52.538
Open case up
in Poughkeepsie.

35:52.580 --> 35:55.219
Security guard named
Allen Nathanson is missing.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.343
WATSON: His ex-wife called
the cops two days ago.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.745
He didn't pick up their
son for the weekend.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.417
She couldn't reach him and
neither could his boss.

36:01.890 --> 36:04.427
Says here he worked
at Jarrett Chemical Supply?

36:04.460 --> 36:06.849
Is that near the sandwich
shop where Krasnov ate?

36:06.890 --> 36:08.255
Two miles up the road.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.256
That's what caught
our attention, too.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.393
The folks there thought
Nathanson just flaked,

36:12.430 --> 36:15.831
deserted his post in the middle
of his overnight shift.

36:15.870 --> 36:18.407
We asked them to take
a closer look at their premises.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.509
They found evidence that someone

36:19.540 --> 36:21.428
had broken into
one of their sheds.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.835
Pretty sure that's
Nathanson's blood.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.541
We think he crossed
with Krasnov,

36:25.580 --> 36:27.844
who was there to steal
a barrel of pesticide.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.677
There's one missing.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.382
Clothianidin is used
to treat corn crops.

36:32.420 --> 36:33.614
I've heard Sherlock
rail against the stuff.

36:33.650 --> 36:34.651
It's bad for bees.

36:34.690 --> 36:35.782
But it is good

36:35.820 --> 36:37.356
for explosives.

36:37.390 --> 36:38.687
With a little know-how,

36:38.730 --> 36:40.618
you can extract a propellant
like Krasnov used

36:40.660 --> 36:42.799
in his bomb.

36:42.830 --> 36:45.390
Is that a partial handprint?

36:45.430 --> 36:46.328
Did they run it?

36:46.370 --> 36:48.338
No, it was too smeared.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.497
There weren't any good whorls,
but it's not a partial.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.861
It's just that Krasnov
has a partial hand.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.730
He's missing his left thumb.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.498
I think it's time
we introduced Mr. Krasnov

36:59.550 --> 37:02.474
to an assistant
district attorney.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.341
He asked for a crime
on American SOII?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.381
I think he's got one.

37:07.420 --> 37:08.853
(elevator bell dings)

37:14.600 --> 37:16.591
Uh, it's your meeting,
Lydia, but remember,

37:16.630 --> 37:20.361
we're looking for more than the
whereabouts of Nathanson's body.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.305
Detectives.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.261
Yeah. I know you?

37:26.310 --> 37:29.575
Uh, I'm Officer Pennebaker,
out of the 8-7.

37:29.610 --> 37:30.975
What do you need, son?

37:31.010 --> 37:33.308
This is Ruslan Krasnov, right?

37:33.350 --> 37:35.716
Yeah. Why do you
want to know?

37:38.720 --> 37:40.449
You okay, son?

37:41.620 --> 37:42.587
(gunshot)

37:42.620 --> 37:44.679
Get down! Shots fired!

37:44.730 --> 37:45.549
(gunshot)

37:48.060 --> 37:50.494
Stay back, stay back.

37:52.500 --> 37:53.694
Who's got the shooter?!

37:53.730 --> 37:55.539
DETECTIVE:
He's down! It's over!

37:56.400 --> 37:57.435
Where is he?!

37:57.470 --> 37:59.961
His name's Pennebaker.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.478
He shot the prisoner,
and then he shot himself.

38:12.450 --> 38:13.883
GREGSON: I'm not speaking ill
of the dead, Mike.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.854
I'm investigating
a murder-suicide

38:15.890 --> 38:18.085
that just happened
under my roof!

38:18.120 --> 38:19.951
I got a dead witness

38:19.990 --> 38:22.424
and a building full of people
who want to know:

38:22.460 --> 38:23.688
how does a shooting go down

38:23.730 --> 38:26.619
in the middle
of a damn police precinct?

38:26.670 --> 38:28.729
I want you to
round up his CD.

38:28.770 --> 38:31.500
and all his friends,
and get them down here

38:31.540 --> 38:33.531
for questioning, now.

38:34.740 --> 38:36.332
(sighs)

38:36.380 --> 38:38.473
8-7's claiming Pennebaker

38:38.510 --> 38:41.104
_ was some kind
of rismg star over there.

38:41.150 --> 38:43.345
His captain swears
he wasn't dirty.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.519
He asked for Ruslan Krasnov
by name.
I know.

38:45.550 --> 38:47.984
After he shot him,
he blows his own brains out?

38:48.020 --> 38:49.510
Who does that for money?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.811
HOLMES:
When Marcus called,

38:50.860 --> 38:52.828
he said the assailant
left some sort of note?

38:52.860 --> 38:54.623
Pennebaker's mother

38:54.660 --> 38:56.355
got an e-mail from him.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.822
"I'm sorry."

38:57.860 --> 38:58.997
That's all it said.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.566
(knocking at door)

39:00.600 --> 39:02.591
You were right.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.459
About what?

39:03.500 --> 39:05.138
Pennebaker was
one of the psychopaths

39:05.170 --> 39:07.707
identified by
the DANTE survey.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.537
What are you talking about?

39:09.580 --> 39:10.877
For a few days now,
we've been aware

39:10.910 --> 39:12.571
there are six such individuals.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.373
One is dead,
another is in custody.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.842
Yes. CCS was working

39:15.880 --> 39:18.485
to identify the other four
off their I.P. addresses.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.385
Yeah, well, one down.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.911
_The e-mail Pennebaker sent
his mom came from a computer

39:22.960 --> 39:25.019
that was used to take
the survey last July.

39:25.060 --> 39:26.982
An agenda is being

39:27.030 --> 39:28.827
perpetrated against my father.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.999
His building was bombed
by Ruslan Krasnov.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.897
His employee, Emil Kurtz,
was murdered by another one

39:33.930 --> 39:35.568
of DANTE's
mental defectives.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.067
When Officer_ Pennebaker's
actions

39:37.100 --> 39:39.705
seemed impossible to explain,
I suggested his I.P. address

39:39.740 --> 39:41.435
be checked
against our list.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.869
The guy who killed Kurtz
was paid to do it.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.571
Pennebaker had two years
on the job.

39:45.610 --> 39:48.579
No complaints, no disciplinary
actions against him.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.576
But you're telling me
he was so crazy

39:50.620 --> 39:52.781
that he actually took money
to cap himself?

39:52.820 --> 39:55.857
I'm as skeptical as you are that
he was financially motivated,

39:55.890 --> 39:57.858
and that he was suddenly
overcome with remorse.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.619
You think he was blackmailed?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.799
He was a psychopath
and an officer of the law.

40:01.830 --> 40:04.697
Hard to imagine that he didn't
have skeletons in his closet.

40:04.730 --> 40:06.618
So perhaps someone found one,
took advantage.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.599
You should try and get
some sleep tonight.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.609
We need to be at our
best for what's to come.

40:15.610 --> 40:17.532
You know as well as I
do what would happen

40:17.580 --> 40:19.502
if Vikner's identity was
known by our colleagues.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.643
The next killer would simply
have more targets on his list.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.648
I didn't say anything.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.908
I know you don't like
keeping secrets

40:24.950 --> 40:26.611
from Marcus and the captain.

40:26.650 --> 40:27.947
I assure you, neither do I.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.548
I still haven't
completely

40:29.590 --> 40:31.558
shaken the feeling
that there's someone else

40:31.590 --> 40:32.989
who I should talk to.

40:35.860 --> 40:38.658
Your father.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.759
Even if he had
Vikner killed,

40:40.800 --> 40:43.166
I mean, would that
really solve everything?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.566
Won't it just be
the next man up for this group?

40:45.610 --> 40:46.759
I assume so.

40:46.810 --> 40:48.061
It's_ difficult
to imagine

40:48.110 --> 40:49.805
that the next man
would be as capable.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.172
Moriarty carried
Vikner's child to term.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.678
She endorsed him
with her very genes,

40:54.720 --> 40:57.814
and then allowed him to keep
her machinery grinding on.

40:57.850 --> 41:00.011
Can you imagine a scenario
in which she overlooked

41:00.050 --> 41:01.779
a more capable candidate?

41:01.820 --> 41:03.253
The world would definitely
be a better place

41:03.290 --> 41:04.257
without Joshua Vikner in it,

41:04.290 --> 41:06.019
no question.

41:06.060 --> 41:07.687
But I really don't think
you want to be

41:07.730 --> 41:09.618
an accessory to murder.

41:09.660 --> 41:10.729
What?

41:13.200 --> 41:15.088
I forgot something
at the station.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.131
Would you mind
returning with me?

41:22.140 --> 41:25.246
So what are we doing?

41:25.280 --> 41:26.702
Apologies for the subterfuge.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.547
I thought, perhaps,
we were being watched.

41:28.580 --> 41:30.116
I didn't see anyone
on the street.

41:30.150 --> 41:32.038
No, the light was on
in the McGuiness's

41:32.090 --> 41:33.580
apartment across the way.

41:33.620 --> 41:34.587
They're out of town.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.848
Forgive my paranoia,

41:35.890 --> 41:37.255
but given recent events,

41:37.290 --> 41:38.780
I thought it best to
use this entrance.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.127
So what do you want to do?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.718
Dig deeper into Pennebaker?

41:41.760 --> 41:44.058
Take another look at Krasnov?

41:44.100 --> 41:46.068
Or are we seriously thinking
about calling your father?

41:46.100 --> 41:47.897
None of the above, Watson.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.728
(steady beeping)
Turns out, I'm not paranoid.
