00:23.315 --> 00:26.026
When you called me from London,
you mentioned a woman.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.362
No, I don't think so.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.280
Don't take me for an idiot, would you?

00:30.280 --> 00:33.116
You said, "She's not interested in money."
Who is she?

00:33.116 --> 00:34.660
Alison Rowdy.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.662
Alison?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.040
- Your Alison?
- Yes, Alison Rowdy.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.292
There you go.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.837
You contacted Alison
when you were in London?

00:45.963 --> 00:48.465
I've always kept tabs on her.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.718
She treated you like shit,
and you go back to her?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.387
I thought you would be more resentful.

00:53.387 --> 00:57.015
- She was the only one who could help me.
- Help you?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.685
She built a new life
by testifying against you.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.604
Not to mention,
she put that redhead's death on your back.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.982
- You should hate her for that.
- Vlado! Vlado!

01:04.982 --> 01:07.442
- What the fuck is that?
- That's it, get lost!

01:07.442 --> 01:10.112
What is he-- What's his problem?

01:10.112 --> 01:12.739
- Come on, sit down.
- You can't do that to me.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.329
Well, in a way, I do hate her.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.790
- Hey, can we have another one, please?
- Yeah?

01:21.790 --> 01:22.916
Thank you.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.670
Don't worry about me, I've moved on.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.339
You know, she's changed.
She gained weight, she got old.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.924
She's not like she used to be.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.135
Here.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.059
The redhead's name was Nathalie.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.269
Oh, yeah?

01:42.811 --> 01:44.229
Can I give you some advice?

01:44.229 --> 01:47.733
Don't trust Alison too much.
Stop playing the fool.

01:50.736 --> 01:51.778
Here.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.031
Her phone.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.701
What do you think I'm doing?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.245
Nothing.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.754
You look a little hungover this morning.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.631
- I feel like crap.
- Yeah.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.675
I came straight here after the Chien Noir.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.845
- Straight here? Really?
- Yeah, I made my guys work all night.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.889
We found something
that might interest you.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.599
Oh, yeah?

05:10.394 --> 05:11.520
Come look.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.729
Go ahead.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.652
Samir's wife?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.654
- Myriam Hamza.
- Yeah?

05:20.654 --> 05:24.408
She took the usual route.
Syria, Turkey, Greece.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.327
She showed her papers.
That's how we found her.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.122
She requested to stay
in the Schengen Area.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.874
They then transferred her to Belgium.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.751
We found her phone number
and checked her calls.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.797
There's a number that she calls daily.
It's presumably Samir.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.800
Let's go grab a cup of coffee. I need it.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.333
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.254
If we stopped messing around
for two minutes, there are two teams.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.506
On one side, there's me
trying to locate the hackers

07:02.506 --> 07:04.967
and on the other,
those trying to eliminate them.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.511
So, what are you getting at?
What's your point?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.096
You want to back out of the mission?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.599
No, but we both know that if I find Samir,
he's going to die.

07:12.599 --> 07:16.061
Is that what you want?
Is that your client's order?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.773
My client is Didier Taraud.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.027
He's the Head of the Élysée's
National Security Services.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.320
The task force,

07:26.154 --> 07:28.782
in charge of counterbalancing
the "superpowers" of the DGSE.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.909
You got anything on him?

07:32.035 --> 07:35.831
He's brilliant, ambitious,
ENA graduate, finance inspector.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.457
He loves money.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.961
Not sure why he didn't join
the private sector.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.588
He would have earned ten times more.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.050
So, we can't do anything.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.845
It's protected by TrueCrypt,
so it's impossible to open.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.388
What did I tell you?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.603
Okay. You have to find Samir.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.732
Here's a new identity and cover.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.902
Go to Brussels and bring back
Samir's wife. That'll make him come.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.701
Sabine Louseau, Taraud's mistress.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.286
She works for the European Commission.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.830
She's taking the train at Gare du Nord
for Brussels this afternoon.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.998
Go talk to her.

08:18.790 --> 08:22.169
So we get some information on Taraud
and know if he's playing both sides.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.846
I'm sorry, but your job sounds like shit.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.806
Okay?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.601
I'm not here to get myself killed.

08:37.601 --> 08:41.813
So, seeing the risks
and the moral prejudice--

08:41.813 --> 08:43.607
Moral prejudice? What prejudice?

08:43.607 --> 08:47.402
Hey. I was forced to contact Alison again.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.321
Yeah.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.782
To see how fat and ugly she's become?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.160
Stop it. Anything interesting in here?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.287
Only useless pictures.

08:57.996 --> 09:02.960
This woman either has a clean record,
or is very, very, very careful.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.671
Well, anyways, as I was saying.

09:05.671 --> 09:09.508
I was paid for one job,
but now it seems that I have two.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.760
So, I need to be paid more.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.332
Excuse me.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.090
<i>Mom</i>?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.093
Is that you?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.137
Of course it is, you piece of shit.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.681
I wasn't going to leave
without a little souvenir of you.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.600
<i>Well, go ahead, search all you want</i>.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.852
Mom, no-- Just a second, Mom.

10:01.852 --> 10:05.772
Don't worry, don't panic.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.775
I'm coming.
I'll take the train to Brussels.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.402
It won't ruin our plans.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.908
You found Samir? Is that where he is?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.534
<i>Well, no</i>.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.411
Listen, I don't know.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.414
I'll talk to his wife.
Maybe she'll tell me.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.876
You're with someone?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.128
Mom.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.256
Stop. Please don't be jealous, okay?

10:37.387 --> 10:38.931
<i>I love you, Mom.</i>

10:45.687 --> 10:48.774
- Men and their mothers, right?
- Yeah. She isn't young anymore.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.027
What's taking so long?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.820
I have no idea what he's doing.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.325
- You're going to Brussels too?
- Yeah.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.661
Me too, it seems the train's late.
I don't know if you've noticed.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.745
- Yes, very late.
- Hello.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.080
Hello, a cup of coffee, please.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.373
- Two, please.
- Two? Very well.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.999
And a pain au chocolat.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.418
And a croissant.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.003
Right away, sir.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.421
I'm watching my weight.

11:15.968 --> 11:16.885
EUROPE AID

11:18.053 --> 11:20.639
- You work for--
- Yes, I work for them.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.349
Well, I work with them.

11:26.937 --> 11:30.566
That's funny. My mom's name is Sabine.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.484
What a coincidence.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.362
Chance.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.997
Here you go.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.249
I'm here for-- I'm not sure how long.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.919
- Thank you.
- So, I'm free whenever you want.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.212
I won't miss it.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.756
- You staying at a hotel or--
- No, I have an apartment here.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.341
Really? All right.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.968
- I should probably take back my luggage.
- Sorry.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.554
And cramique? Do you eat cramique,
craquelin and all of that?

12:42.554 --> 12:44.473
- No, not at all.
- Do you know what it is?

12:44.473 --> 12:46.683
- No.
- We should go eat some craquelin then.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.696
Did you see how
they divided us into groups? Let's go.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.153
Hello. Hi.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.328
I'm here for Mrs. Hamza, Myriam Hamza.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.580
The asylum request she made
has been granted.

14:33.916 --> 14:34.958
Okay.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.553
Here she is.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.348
She arrived yesterday.
So she must still be in quarantine.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.225
All right, thank you.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.079
Hello. The main office, please.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.664
Can I see your pass, please?

15:16.708 --> 15:17.960
It's over there.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.045
- There?
- Yeah.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.186
So, Myriam Hamza,
it's going to be right over there.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.239
Mrs. Hamza. I've found you at last.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.658
My Arabic is a little rusty.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.827
I'm Lounès Cordier.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.289
But more importantly, how are you?
How's your health?

15:55.289 --> 15:56.832
I am well, thank you.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.250
Thanks be to God.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.587
And how about your son? Hicham, is it?

16:02.337 --> 16:03.881
He is well, thanks be to God.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.132
Thanks be to God.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.093
Do you speak French?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.386
French?

16:09.386 --> 16:10.512
No.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.337
That's all right. That's all right.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.268
Are you okay?

17:00.103 --> 17:03.190
Are you happy here? Are you at ease?

17:35.681 --> 17:36.682
I don't know.

18:21.727 --> 18:22.769
...System.

18:35.449 --> 18:38.493
I'll come. Wait for me, please, sir?

18:38.493 --> 18:40.245
I'll go and get my son.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.794
Thank you, Lounès. You're very kind.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.838
Fine.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.836
Ms. Louseau, you seem to want
to make things complicated.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.506
I'm simply asking you to respect
the procedures, Ms. Rowdy.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.382
The EU is not a self-service.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.087
- Hello, how are you?
- Hey.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.841
This is Samir. He's from Syria.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.093
- Say hi, Samir. Say hello.
- One moment.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.928
- Say it.
- Just a minute.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.138
Hi, Samir.

22:26.138 --> 22:28.891
He's on the phone.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.359
How many people are in your tent?
They don't give us...

22:39.359 --> 22:40.444
God be with you.

22:57.211 --> 22:59.171
<i>Hello, this is Myriam.</i>

22:59.171 --> 23:03.550
<i>I can't take your call, so leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

23:03.550 --> 23:07.054
Yes, we're taking you to the hospital.
Come on.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.889
No! Help me!

23:08.889 --> 23:11.517
Help me! Help me! No!

23:12.267 --> 23:13.268
Stop!

23:13.268 --> 23:16.563
Help me! Help me! Help me!

23:17.564 --> 23:21.026
Stop! Leave her alone! Stop! Stop!

23:21.026 --> 23:23.362
Traffickers! Traffickers!

23:25.364 --> 23:26.907
Stop them!

23:26.907 --> 23:28.450
Bastards!

23:37.668 --> 23:39.044
Pick up, Myriam.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.923
- Who were those men?
- I don't know.

23:42.923 --> 23:45.384
My husband has some problems.

23:45.384 --> 23:47.594
What? What kind of problems?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.610
Lounès! Lounès!

24:17.082 --> 24:18.166
Wake up!

24:34.600 --> 24:35.601
My dear.

24:50.866 --> 24:51.742
It's me.

24:53.035 --> 24:54.286
<i>I need you.</i>

24:54.828 --> 24:56.079
Where are you?

25:26.818 --> 25:28.862
<i>Welcome to Antropa.</i>

27:53.090 --> 27:54.967
Don't get carried away.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.176
Come on.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.351
We're almost there.

30:54.938 --> 30:57.858
- Come on. Take it slow.
- I'm okay.

31:05.282 --> 31:07.743
Wait, I'll do it. I'll do it.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.542
Are you okay?

31:16.335 --> 31:17.711
Call your husband.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.839
Tell him you're in trouble.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.343
Tell him to call me. Hurry!

31:25.052 --> 31:26.053
Okay, okay.

31:26.553 --> 31:28.472
- And then take out the battery.
- Okay.

31:28.472 --> 31:29.556
Thank you.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.352
She knows where Samir is?

31:36.230 --> 31:37.314
They have a code.

31:37.898 --> 31:40.692
She leaves him a message on a phone,
and he calls back with another.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.821
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

31:47.241 --> 31:49.910
So, you don't want to play doctor
with me anymore?

31:53.705 --> 31:57.042
Listen, you take them
and turn them slightly.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.461
It's like a little hook.
You have to take out the hook.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.421
Try to get it out
without tearing everything.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.548
Understand?

32:03.048 --> 32:05.884
Go ahead and disinfect a little
at the same time.

32:05.884 --> 32:07.845
- Okay.
- Please.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.306
Go ahead.

32:17.479 --> 32:18.564
What's wrong?

32:19.481 --> 32:20.816
You're scared or something?

32:25.654 --> 32:26.655
Come on.

32:37.875 --> 32:38.959
That's it.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.713
- Now turn it.
- Wait.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.014
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

33:04.735 --> 33:07.362
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

33:07.362 --> 33:08.447
You got it?

33:17.080 --> 33:18.081
- There's one left?
- Yes.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.166
Go ahead.

33:27.591 --> 33:29.259
Fuck!

34:04.628 --> 34:06.255
Can you sit down for two seconds?

34:17.474 --> 34:19.768
I'm not sure how you feel about it now--

34:21.395 --> 34:23.480
Well, I guess you must hate me to death.

34:26.358 --> 34:29.902
What I'm trying to say is, I don't want
to think about all that anymore.

34:29.902 --> 34:34.157
I'm trying to forget everything and
move on. And you're not a happy memory.

34:35.701 --> 34:37.578
I've been seeing someone
for the past five years,

34:37.578 --> 34:39.079
and we're going to get married.

34:42.708 --> 34:43.708
But,

34:44.585 --> 34:46.170
does he know about everything?

34:48.797 --> 34:50.047
No.

34:52.634 --> 34:53.635
And you love him?

34:54.219 --> 34:56.388
Yes. Tremendously.

34:58.807 --> 34:59.850
"Tremendously"?

35:03.604 --> 35:04.605
He must be kind then.

35:05.272 --> 35:06.899
Why? Is it stupid to be kind?

35:09.985 --> 35:12.321
I'm trying to tell you that I've changed.

35:12.321 --> 35:14.364
- You think people change?
- I hope so.

35:14.364 --> 35:18.785
I hate the woman that I was,
the things that happened.

35:20.454 --> 35:21.663
It was an accident, right?

35:27.920 --> 35:30.631
Nonetheless, it's too late.

35:30.631 --> 35:34.885
We can't be friends. Or anything else.

35:37.721 --> 35:38.764
Of course.

35:46.772 --> 35:47.940
Nice going.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.114
What are you telling me?

36:03.830 --> 36:05.290
What are you telling me?

36:14.132 --> 36:15.133
Oh, yes.

36:15.717 --> 36:17.761
You soothed him. Thank you.

36:18.762 --> 36:19.763
God bless him.

39:41.298 --> 39:44.051
We're in luck,
Mr. Vandermeer is back from Berlin.

39:52.684 --> 39:54.311
She's Richard Banks' adviser.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.939
<i>You know, the one who's tailing Bolton</i>.

39:56.939 --> 39:58.065
You know her name?

40:00.067 --> 40:02.444
- You think she caught on?
- <i>That I tried blocking the deal</i>?

40:02.444 --> 40:04.279
Yes. She got it loud and clear.

40:04.947 --> 40:06.740
<i>What should I do</i>?

40:07.407 --> 40:10.911
So, tonight, when they come to sign
the papers, I don't want you there.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.829
<i>Being there or not
won't stop them from signing.</i>

40:12.829 --> 40:15.874
I put an enormous amount of money in
a Swiss bank account for you. Don't argue.

40:15.874 --> 40:18.544
- Don't talk to me like that.
- <i>Then stop</i>.

40:18.544 --> 40:21.588
It's not over yet. Tonight you'll be
unable to attend because of your son.

40:21.588 --> 40:24.132
And you let Vandermeer
handle the British on his own.

40:26.385 --> 40:28.053
Take the money back. I don't want it.

40:28.053 --> 40:29.721
You don't care about Pierre then?

40:30.973 --> 40:33.642
You know, making a half-baked baby
is a luxury, my dear.

40:44.820 --> 40:48.866
Bob, who's the idiot you sent to Brussels?
Clearly, he didn't understand a thing.

40:48.866 --> 40:49.992
Is there a problem?

40:49.992 --> 40:53.036
The problem is that they got
an appointment to sign the papers tonight,

40:53.036 --> 40:54.872
and there's nothing I can do about it.

41:13.390 --> 41:16.101
<i>How am I supposed to
pay this in such a short time?</i>

41:49.259 --> 41:51.512
It's kind of you to remember my name.

41:51.512 --> 41:54.264
I really need a drink. How about it?

41:56.016 --> 41:57.142
That's good news.

41:58.435 --> 41:59.728
Meet up in an hour?

42:02.314 --> 42:03.357
I can manage that.

42:04.191 --> 42:06.443
<i>See you later. I'll send you the address</i>.

44:13.237 --> 44:15.364
- How are you?
- Fine.

44:16.782 --> 44:19.201
That must have hurt.
And I thought I was having a bad day.

44:19.201 --> 44:21.036
It's nothing. Just personal stuff.

44:22.663 --> 44:24.164
- Another.
- Okay.

44:26.625 --> 44:30.254
I didn't care that he was married.
I was fascinated by him.

44:30.254 --> 44:32.172
I wanted everything he could give me.

44:33.257 --> 44:35.926
I was addicted to his world.
Stupid, right?

44:35.926 --> 44:37.052
No.

44:38.762 --> 44:40.389
I was an addict too for a while.

44:41.557 --> 44:43.308
It made me do all kinds of stupid things.

44:44.768 --> 44:48.605
Then I understood that in that situation,
there aren't a lot of choices.

44:50.148 --> 44:51.483
You leave or you're screwed.

44:52.651 --> 44:54.862
Did you manage? To completely cut ties?

44:54.862 --> 44:56.196
Yes.

44:58.782 --> 45:00.075
That doesn't mean that...

45:03.036 --> 45:08.083
my heart doesn't ache when I think of her,
but it's nostalgia. It's in the past.

45:09.751 --> 45:11.170
You see her often?

45:13.422 --> 45:14.715
No. No, no.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.634
It's not possible.

45:19.928 --> 45:21.471
But I have a child with him.

45:24.766 --> 45:26.435
I didn't know. You have a child?

45:31.607 --> 45:34.526
To children... of others.

46:10.479 --> 46:12.481
Wait, let me get that for you.

46:12.481 --> 46:13.815
Thank you.

46:16.985 --> 46:18.529
- Can I sit beside you?
- Yes.

47:14.293 --> 47:15.669
It's lovely!

47:17.045 --> 47:18.630
The nanny is sleeping over there.

47:40.360 --> 47:41.528
Wait.
