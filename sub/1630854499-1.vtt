01:14.344 --> 01:19.007
Dear Giuseppe, you must be surprised
to hear from your best friend.

01:19.257 --> 01:22.428
I hope you still consider me that,
after so much time.

01:22.894 --> 01:29.297
Where should I begin to tell you
of my adventures?

01:29.693 --> 01:34.648
I want to tell you every incredible
event that brought me here.

01:34.856 --> 01:39.261
Perhaps you won't believe me,
but I was almost killed.

01:39.511 --> 01:45.099
First, by an American bullet,
then by an American Truck.

01:45.308 --> 01:50.395
Then I became successful,
in the American way.

01:50.673 --> 01:55.152
I was then chased like a hero
in an action film.

01:55.361 --> 02:01.741
I could go on, up to yesterday's encounter
with a very special person.

02:02.049 --> 02:06.527
I won't say who right now,
to keep you in suspense.

02:07.481 --> 02:11.852
I'll just say that tomorrow I'll
realize my lifelong dream.

02:12.018 --> 02:15.939
Here in New York, where
I always wanted to come...

02:16.106 --> 02:20.861
even though you were against it.
But anyhow...

02:21.027 --> 02:25.156
I'm so emotional.

02:25.365 --> 02:31.788
I want to tell you everything
from the beginning.

02:32.664 --> 02:37.226
It was last summer in Castelluzzo.
You were there too.

02:37.435 --> 02:42.674
We were in our usual place,
discussing politics.

02:42.883 --> 02:49.803
The Seattle protests have put a
thorn in the side of the globalists.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.328
The war's over, comrades!

02:52.429 --> 02:54.729
- Fuck off!
- Ignore them.

02:54.853 --> 02:56.732
- Russomanno!
- What?

02:56.833 --> 02:58.533
Bite me!

02:58.940 --> 03:04.346
Did you understand the importance of
the "Three days of Catania"?

03:04.597 --> 03:05.700
Sure.

03:06.008 --> 03:12.569
It sends a strong message against
The IMF, and it's about time!

03:12.719 --> 03:13.980
Yeah!

03:14.188 --> 03:21.426
We can't support a leftist government
with so many corrupt deputies.

03:23.607 --> 03:26.868
You're not listening.
You're watching the girls.

03:27.093 --> 03:29.729
- Me?
- What did I say?

03:29.937 --> 03:34.142
That the leftist government doesn't
represent us.

03:34.309 --> 03:36.229
Not just that, Tanino.

03:36.479 --> 03:41.624
Globalisation is taking over,
and we don't fight it.

03:42.109 --> 03:45.036
- Who, You and me?
- All of us!

03:45.219 --> 03:48.073
Take the Single European Currency.

03:48.156 --> 03:50.242
Yeah, that's a good thing.

03:50.367 --> 03:53.987
Idiot!
It's not good. It's crap!

03:54.154 --> 03:56.873
I know, but you're confusing me.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.328
And the multinationals with their
genetically modified crops!

04:01.654 --> 04:05.782
"Three days of Catania" will fight this.

04:05.958 --> 04:09.460
- Did she lose something?
- We've all lost something.

04:09.585 --> 04:14.065
But we haven't lost the will to fight.
Where are you going?

04:17.636 --> 04:19.394
I see it!

04:41.185 --> 04:43.536
Thanks a lot!

04:43.804 --> 04:45.105
You're welcome!

04:45.306 --> 04:48.306
Look at his eyes!
They're beautiful!

04:48.876 --> 04:53.513
- What?
- You have beautiful eyes.

04:54.131 --> 04:56.065
Thanks.

04:57.066 --> 05:00.366
- What is your name?
- I'm Sally.

05:00.770 --> 05:03.648
My name is Tanino.

05:13.066 --> 05:16.894
- That's pathetic!
- What did I do?

05:17.103 --> 05:21.924
- The classic move by the Italian male!
- I just helped her!

05:22.133 --> 05:25.370
The gentleman bit!
Are we still there?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.288
They're looking at us!

05:27.497 --> 05:30.002
- Hello!
- What are you doing?

05:30.103 --> 05:33.503
- Saying, Hi.
- How embarrassing!

05:41.411 --> 05:42.980
Hi!

05:43.688 --> 05:48.818
Me and my friend, Melissa,
are going out for pizza tonight.

05:49.069 --> 05:51.112
Want to join us?

05:51.321 --> 05:54.532
A Pizza together, we and you?

05:56.135 --> 05:58.787
Do You know the pizzeria in town?

05:58.995 --> 06:04.400
- The one in public square?
- That's the only pizzeria!

06:05.135 --> 06:08.798
- They invited us for pizza.
- we can't go!

06:09.081 --> 06:13.301
- Why not?
- The train for Catania leaves at 9:15.

06:13.526 --> 06:16.971
That's True!
Excuse me, a little problem!

06:17.279 --> 06:20.058
We have the "Three days of Catania".

06:20.141 --> 06:22.335
Definitive!

06:23.153 --> 06:26.389
- So you can't?
- I am sorry.

06:26.731 --> 06:29.434
Okay, Let's get going.

06:29.826 --> 06:32.405
- Isn't he funny?
- Yeah.

06:32.606 --> 06:34.306
Ciao!

06:36.575 --> 06:38.887
- What did she say?
- "Funny".

06:38.888 --> 06:40.788
What's that mean?

06:40.854 --> 06:44.641
"Ridiculous".
Personally, I agree.

06:48.061 --> 06:53.216
Is Tanino really studying film at the
University in Rome?

06:53.341 --> 06:57.545
- Yes, "Science and Communication".
- "OF Communication", Mom.

06:57.854 --> 07:01.134
Show-biz is fascinating.

07:01.459 --> 07:06.237
My cousin knows someone at RAI.
His wife works in advertising.

07:06.362 --> 07:10.108
Why don't I introduce you, Tanino.

07:10.233 --> 07:13.445
He's not interested in TV.

07:13.570 --> 07:17.157
He likes the movie starlets!

07:17.282 --> 07:21.770
Why doesn't he make a film here?
He can put us in it.

07:22.037 --> 07:24.998
Yes, "Vacation in Castelluzzo!"

07:25.582 --> 07:29.961
- Mainstream cinema doesn't interest him.
- What does he like?

07:30.086 --> 07:34.174
He likes intellectual films,
only from certain countries.

07:34.441 --> 07:36.053
Mom, Be quiet!

07:36.254 --> 07:39.654
- Which countries?
- Iran, Iraq...

07:39.720 --> 07:41.648
Tanino, you tell her!

07:41.831 --> 07:43.558
It's burning!

07:43.683 --> 07:47.029
Why do I have this cabbage hair?

07:47.212 --> 07:51.066
- Fresh juice?
- No, Mr. Basilio.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.337
Then I'll drink it.

07:53.338 --> 07:55.638
Mom, where's Dad's shirt?

07:55.862 --> 07:58.556
It's in the dresser!

08:03.503 --> 08:06.540
- I don't like Basilio.
- Why?

08:06.706 --> 08:10.293
- He seems gay.
- But he's married.

08:10.377 --> 08:12.764
- Where's his wife?
- She's dead.

08:12.865 --> 08:15.565
- Did he kill her?
- Are You crazy?

08:18.301 --> 08:21.263
- Giuseppe's here.
- Make an excuse!

08:21.471 --> 08:25.809
- Are you ill? Are you in Rome?
- He knows I'm here.

08:26.385 --> 08:29.073
Hi, Giuseppe!
Tanino isn't here.

08:29.274 --> 08:32.573
He had to meet with his cousins.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.575
But the train is leaving!

08:35.735 --> 08:39.306
You go ahead!
He'll go later.

08:39.407 --> 08:42.407
- How?
- With his cousins.

08:42.515 --> 08:44.861
Ciao, Giuseppe!

08:45.161 --> 08:49.541
My cousins are 1 year old,
the other 6 months!

08:50.175 --> 08:57.105
Giuseppe, Excuse me for doing that
to you and to our friendship.

09:01.728 --> 09:06.766
I still wonder what specifically
attracted me so much to Sally.

09:06.975 --> 09:12.037
She was kind, honest,
and down to earth.

09:12.365 --> 09:18.028
Perhaps it was my destiny calling,
and I didn't know it.

09:18.153 --> 09:20.280
Are those your friends?

09:20.405 --> 09:22.991
Never seen them!

09:23.491 --> 09:28.079
For those three days,
we were inseparable.

09:28.246 --> 09:32.851
Unfortunately, her friend was
inseparable too.

09:33.452 --> 09:36.752
- Say Hello to America.
- "Hello to America".

09:39.424 --> 09:43.470
The light gives me a sense of obscurity.

09:43.553 --> 09:47.557
Sally studied Sicilian painters
of the past.

09:47.766 --> 09:51.770
She knows everything. More than me,
and I was born in Sicily.

09:51.937 --> 09:59.240
She's not an expert on political issues,
like the identity crisis of the left,

09:59.419 --> 10:04.241
or conflicts of interest, but
she learns what she studies.

10:04.542 --> 10:08.642
This is so boring!
Let's go to the beach, Please!

10:10.643 --> 10:14.443
Come on, Chop, Chop, Chop!
Andiamo!

10:17.162 --> 10:22.717
Here's Miss Sally Garfield,
direct from the USA.

10:22.843 --> 10:26.263
Enough, Tanino!

10:26.429 --> 10:30.216
You come from Seaport,
in the state of... How's it called?

10:30.425 --> 10:32.205
Rhode lsland!

10:32.406 --> 10:36.306
Why did you come to Castelluzzo?

10:36.414 --> 10:39.025
Say what the Italians in Seaport said!

10:39.109 --> 10:44.631
In Seaport there are many Sicilians.
The mayor is Sicilian.

10:44.832 --> 10:48.032
He's from Campania. "Campanaro"?

10:48.285 --> 10:52.330
But he's not very nice.
He's kind of mafioso!

10:52.497 --> 10:56.543
Many Sicilians in my city are
from Castelluzzo.

10:56.710 --> 11:01.489
They say, "Go visit Castelluzzo!"
And so, Here I am!

11:02.140 --> 11:04.569
But Castelluzzo isn't so beautiful.

11:04.778 --> 11:10.056
Taormina and Siracusa are beautiful, but
Castelluzzo is so-so.

11:10.182 --> 11:12.475
It's ugly!

11:13.719 --> 11:18.190
- You are so funny!
- You always say I'm funny.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.609
That's not good!

11:30.060 --> 11:31.812
May I?

11:32.013 --> 11:35.213
Come on in!
The water is great!

11:35.214 --> 11:37.314
Come on, Sally!

11:49.722 --> 11:54.927
After spending so much time together,
just before she went home,

11:55.093 --> 11:58.513
we were able to explore
our relationship objectively,

11:58.764 --> 12:02.609
because we had become more
than just friends.

12:02.817 --> 12:05.229
The Description Of A Moment

12:05.338 --> 12:07.507
the convictions that change

12:07.716 --> 12:11.969
and collapse the fortress
of my weakness.

12:12.178 --> 12:16.289
You're no longer alone 'cause
you don't want to be alone

12:16.414 --> 12:20.460
and believe that sharing your life
is normal.

12:20.627 --> 12:25.173
But my memory slips,
I remember slightly

12:25.382 --> 12:28.701
sending thoughts.

12:29.027 --> 12:34.933
Feeling that in a moment,
whatever we thought...

12:35.559 --> 12:39.436
could happen.

12:43.333 --> 12:51.248
And then what happened?
Did we wait or forget.

12:51.984 --> 12:57.032
Now we see each other...

12:57.333 --> 13:01.333
after almost 5 years.

13:02.536 --> 13:07.132
And it's always that
description of a moment.

13:07.299 --> 13:11.778
A video camera!
Good for video replays.

13:12.179 --> 13:14.181
Thanks.

13:46.082 --> 13:49.082
ROME
Three Months Later

13:49.349 --> 13:53.937
So, What is love for me?

13:56.014 --> 13:59.434
Sincerity, Trust...

14:01.035 --> 14:04.235
How do you say, Physical Attraction?

14:04.940 --> 14:07.683
Piaciamento Fisico?

14:08.610 --> 14:12.822
It's like that.
Let's speak English now!

14:13.749 --> 14:16.076
What do you think of me?

14:17.236 --> 14:22.198
You're very nice.
How do you say, "I'll miss you"?

14:24.251 --> 14:27.779
He's always watching the American girl!

14:28.446 --> 14:31.550
You'll become blind!

14:31.716 --> 14:35.178
We want to watch the game,
Fiorentina - Bari.

14:35.428 --> 14:39.933
- Go Bari!
- Bari made a goal!

14:44.855 --> 14:47.858
He ate all mom's cookies!

14:48.024 --> 14:53.154
- Everything!
- And Uncle's tomato sauce!

14:53.363 --> 14:55.824
What did you say?

14:56.032 --> 14:58.493
DIALECT

15:02.164 --> 15:06.209
- Sicilian, Open your ears!
- I'm sick of you!

15:06.534 --> 15:09.553
- Go back to Sicily!
- Southerner!

15:09.861 --> 15:12.674
I was here first!

15:12.883 --> 15:17.345
DIALECT

15:18.305 --> 15:21.507
Damn Puglies!
I can't study anymore.

15:22.042 --> 15:24.644
Who Is Chinawsky?

15:24.895 --> 15:29.758
Personally I believe he's one of
the best directors alive.

15:29.966 --> 15:32.411
He lives in New York.

15:32.577 --> 15:36.239
He's one of the most important
directors in the world.

15:36.448 --> 15:41.578
My friend thinks the same.
Russomanno Giuseppe.

15:41.845 --> 15:44.047
You know him?

15:44.881 --> 15:50.378
His films are bitter yet provocative,
A refuge from indulgence.

15:50.921 --> 15:54.157
- What was it?
- A refuge from indulgence.

15:54.583 --> 15:57.635
Okay!
A refuge from indulgence!

15:57.902 --> 15:59.996
Sorry, but...

16:00.147 --> 16:02.192
Are you okay?

16:02.359 --> 16:07.363
No, I couldn't sleep last night because
I live with an awful group of Puglies!

16:07.430 --> 16:09.774
- A group?
- Of Puglies!

16:09.775 --> 16:11.875
I understand.

16:13.902 --> 16:15.733
Do you want some water?

16:16.034 --> 16:19.634
Thanks!
This exam is very important for me.

16:19.941 --> 16:24.579
- Military Service?
- You read my mind.

16:24.788 --> 16:29.334
Tell me one thing that goes along
with the theme of this course.

16:29.543 --> 16:34.506
- One thing?
- An Italian film from the 60's.

16:35.340 --> 16:39.636
- They are many!
- Give me one title.

16:41.096 --> 16:44.099
- Can I say one from Fellini?
- Yes!

16:44.933 --> 16:49.554
The White Ship... On The Road.
What was it?

16:50.355 --> 16:53.683
Professor, I've drawn a blank.

16:54.092 --> 17:00.380
It's a film that has a number for
its title. Understand?

17:00.689 --> 17:07.523
Sure, I think it's "12", no?
12 and something.

17:17.441 --> 17:22.304
Giuseppe, you know what happens
when I get in trouble.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.557
I lose my senses and forget
where I am.

17:25.765 --> 17:32.028
It's like my soul leaves my body and
goes somewhere happier.

17:32.378 --> 17:36.092
Far away and unattainable.

18:02.677 --> 18:07.390
Tanino, Your bite hurts your mother.

18:08.433 --> 18:13.730
But you've drunk my milk,
and you've grown tall!

18:14.356 --> 18:16.900
You've become very tall!

18:33.375 --> 18:35.335
Dad!

18:39.589 --> 18:44.553
- What happened?
- I'll tell you. Do you have a cigarette?

18:45.979 --> 18:49.808
Don't worry, Tanino!

18:49.975 --> 18:53.862
Wait Dad!
I have so many questions.

19:44.713 --> 19:47.999
Momma! Mom!

19:56.500 --> 19:58.996
- You're here early?
- 30 with honors.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.197
I was resting.

20:01.505 --> 20:05.358
Are you hungry?
There's eggplant in the oven.

20:05.666 --> 20:10.294
Or do you want pasta?
I made meatballs.

20:10.503 --> 20:13.840
Why are you early?
What about your exam?

20:14.107 --> 20:16.920
I told you, 30 with honors.

20:17.345 --> 20:19.447
Is someone here?

20:24.703 --> 20:28.031
It broke, but maybe you can fix it.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.992
It's not important.

20:30.300 --> 20:35.956
- I hurt myself.
- Basilio, Tanino has a surprise.

20:36.164 --> 20:40.752
- He got 30 with honors.
- Excellent! My compliments!

20:49.469 --> 20:52.939
Stop playing ball at night!

20:53.248 --> 20:55.334
I can't sleep!

20:55.826 --> 20:58.478
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

20:58.687 --> 21:01.273
I wanted to show you this.

21:01.974 --> 21:06.862
- What is it?
- My Cousin works in the Military Office.

21:07.070 --> 21:13.383
It's a list of the guys being called to
military service. You're on the list.

21:14.091 --> 21:18.795
But you passed your exam.
You can get an exemption.

21:19.091 --> 21:21.869
- It's all under control.
- Well...

21:22.035 --> 21:26.347
If you have any problems,
we can work something out.

21:26.623 --> 21:32.353
- Your mother doesn't need to know.
- Leave her alone!

21:32.821 --> 21:39.728
I understand your hostility is driven
by psychological reasons.

21:40.103 --> 21:42.814
But you are a modern boy.

21:43.140 --> 21:46.868
You must have sympathy for
two lonely hearts...

21:47.052 --> 21:51.990
who have found happiness together.
Why deny it?

21:52.115 --> 21:55.427
- What?
- Me and your mother, Tanino!

21:55.535 --> 21:58.997
Don't touch me!
I hardly know you.

21:59.506 --> 22:01.958
We'll get to know each other.

22:02.301 --> 22:06.805
We'll learn to help each other.

22:07.214 --> 22:10.250
Don't deny this opportunity!

22:17.107 --> 22:21.386
Nothing's worse than a Winter's
Sunday in Castelluzzo,

22:21.453 --> 22:26.016
than when you realize,
that your life stinks.

22:26.225 --> 22:31.112
And that you're not worth anything,
not to yourself, nor to others.

22:31.312 --> 22:33.949
Nothing is worse!

22:37.611 --> 22:42.249
The only person who could help me
was my old friend, Giuseppe.

22:42.415 --> 22:46.987
In fact, the following Monday
I went looking for you at work.

22:47.195 --> 22:49.240
How can I help?

22:49.490 --> 22:53.418
I don't want to be a soldier.
They'll put me in Kosovo.

22:53.543 --> 22:55.996
There's no sea there!

22:56.221 --> 22:58.283
You don't get the phone?

22:58.484 --> 22:59.884
Get the phone!

23:00.085 --> 23:02.485
DIALECT

23:03.345 --> 23:05.590
- What if I escape?
- Where to?

23:05.791 --> 23:08.091
- To the U.S.
- Are you crazy?

23:08.357 --> 23:11.161
I know you don't like The U.S.,

23:11.370 --> 23:14.698
but I promised Sally I'd find her.

23:14.948 --> 23:16.327
Who?

23:16.428 --> 23:19.228
The American girl from last Summer.

23:19.494 --> 23:25.250
- And the airfare?
- I can go on a ship, and uh...

23:25.667 --> 23:29.662
- Give me some advice!
- What can I say?

23:29.871 --> 23:33.193
Castelluzzo has a great mystery.

23:33.418 --> 23:37.345
I trust your confidentiality 100%.

23:37.470 --> 23:41.474
But Castelluzzo has a mysterious
comunicative power...

23:41.700 --> 23:44.837
that makes the internet look slow!

23:44.904 --> 23:47.556
There's the guy going to America!

23:48.056 --> 23:50.186
Okay, Okay, Okay!

23:50.487 --> 23:53.687
- Say Hi to Pamela Anderson!
- Who?

23:54.363 --> 23:59.668
Tanino, Make us proud in America!
Forza Castelluzzo!

23:59.835 --> 24:03.798
We drink this wine to the
honor of Tanino...

24:05.966 --> 24:09.478
I've been looking for you!
Did I hurt you?

24:09.645 --> 24:13.907
- Are you Tanino, who's going to America?
- What do you want?

24:14.074 --> 24:17.802
- Li Causi Franco. Please follow me.
- Why?

24:18.011 --> 24:19.971
Please!

24:45.747 --> 24:49.400
This crappy country and job!

24:49.567 --> 24:52.212
You're smart to go to America.

24:52.379 --> 24:55.165
The others just talk about going.

24:55.373 --> 24:59.295
My brother Angelo moved there
20 years ago.

24:59.603 --> 25:06.893
He has it good there in Seaport.
He's got a big house with 5 baths!

25:07.060 --> 25:12.649
I can't go because of my health.

25:12.816 --> 25:14.860
- To Seaport?
- Yes.

25:15.068 --> 25:19.207
See those bags?
They have to go to Seaport.

25:19.408 --> 25:22.008
Here's your plane ticket.

25:22.199 --> 25:26.688
You go in my place, instead of
taking the long boat trip.

25:26.997 --> 25:30.825
That's for Leonardo DiCaprio!

25:30.992 --> 25:34.305
It seemed like a spy film,
a bit Italian comedy.

25:34.472 --> 25:39.743
Now I realize it wasn't only Providence
that sent me to America.

25:39.910 --> 25:43.623
I didn't know it then, but
I was set on traveling.

25:43.831 --> 25:47.277
I kept going over the email
I sent to Sally,

25:47.486 --> 25:50.290
announcing my surprise visit.

25:50.598 --> 25:56.794
I kept reading her reply,
but it was very vague.

25:57.103 --> 26:01.115
I thought maybe I wouldn't go.

26:01.865 --> 26:04.827
But destiny decided for me.

26:05.135 --> 26:10.023
I left at night, just like
an adventure novel.

26:15.724 --> 26:19.424
Mom, I'm leaving for America.
Don't know when I'll be back.

26:19.525 --> 26:22.925
I'll write when I can,
Your son, Tanino

26:29.042 --> 26:31.442
Did you see last night's game?

26:32.043 --> 26:34.538
- Go!
- Is it Okay?

26:34.830 --> 26:36.525
Thanks!

26:37.534 --> 26:39.728
Thanks a lot!

26:56.127 --> 27:00.298
I was met by the Li Causi family.

27:00.507 --> 27:04.902
Mr. Angelo, his wife Santa,
3 Rosario's, Vito.

27:05.111 --> 27:07.639
It was Castelluzzo overseas.

27:07.806 --> 27:10.959
I'll introduce you to all the
Italians!

27:11.268 --> 27:14.563
We'll give you a good welcome.

27:14.896 --> 27:18.441
There's many young people:
Cousins Salvo, Dino, Pippo, Pino!

27:18.567 --> 27:21.580
Sebastiano, Aunt Rosa,
Rosina, Rosetta...

27:21.581 --> 27:24.881
- Hey, I'm talking here!
- You didn't say my parents.

27:25.105 --> 27:27.576
They're not from Castelluzzo!

27:27.742 --> 27:30.954
- Do you like people from Ragusa?
- What?

27:31.163 --> 27:33.999
- He's great!
- Oh yes!

27:42.641 --> 27:46.386
- Make yourself confortable.
- Are you tired?

27:46.595 --> 27:50.391
Are you hungry?
I'll fix you something at home.

27:50.692 --> 27:53.792
What the fuck you doing?
You gonna break everything!

27:53.993 --> 27:55.093
No problem!

28:03.528 --> 28:07.574
The first days, stay home and rest!

28:07.782 --> 28:12.770
You can eat at home or in our
restaurants. Give him the map!

28:13.130 --> 28:16.374
- How many maps you give him?
- I don't know!

28:16.583 --> 28:19.419
- How's Italy?
- Well, it's...

28:19.878 --> 28:24.041
Di Pietro is in jail.
The Communists have taken over.

28:24.391 --> 28:28.261
But Berlusconi will get them,
kick their ass!

28:28.428 --> 28:30.722
Am I right, Tanino?

28:30.847 --> 28:34.976
- Where is Green Hill?
- Why do you want go there?

28:35.352 --> 28:37.613
I need to bring someone something.

28:37.614 --> 28:39.114
- A girl?
- An American girl?

28:39.222 --> 28:42.526
American girls can't cook,
and they divorce!

28:42.651 --> 28:45.946
Some asshole lawyer makes you
pay alimony.

28:46.029 --> 28:49.333
Up to $100,000 a year!

28:49.400 --> 28:52.328
So don't get any ideas!

28:52.453 --> 28:56.615
Because I want you to go back
and kick the Ragusas ass!

28:56.840 --> 28:58.453
Son of a Bitch!

28:58.554 --> 29:01.754
Look at those dummies!

29:02.078 --> 29:07.482
The guys are throwing a welcome
party for you at the club.

29:07.691 --> 29:09.677
They'll love you!

29:09.777 --> 29:12.639
Okay, where's Green Hill?

29:12.889 --> 29:16.434
Still this Green Hill!
It's all old houses.

29:16.643 --> 29:19.396
There's no shopping malls,
no McDonald's!

29:19.604 --> 29:21.394
Is it far from your house?

29:21.395 --> 29:25.795
It's the other side of town,
by the University.

29:25.902 --> 29:29.322
We'll bring her the thing for you.

29:34.161 --> 29:37.747
- Where are you going?
- Thanks, I'll call you!

29:40.375 --> 29:42.377
Is he crazy?

31:18.073 --> 31:21.726
Hello, I am Tanino,
the friend of Sally.

31:22.627 --> 31:25.427
I am Italian boy,
Friend of Sally Garfield.

31:25.428 --> 31:27.428
Is she here?

31:27.429 --> 31:29.429
Speak English?

31:33.839 --> 31:35.323
Goodbye!

31:40.324 --> 31:41.924
Oh my God!

31:42.225 --> 31:44.025
I can't believe it!

31:45.434 --> 31:48.070
I brought you this.

31:51.623 --> 31:56.386
My camera! It doesn't matter,
my father has another.

31:57.954 --> 32:00.056
Anyway, Thank You.

32:00.683 --> 32:03.360
Can I give you a kiss?

32:10.926 --> 32:15.030
It's incredible to be here in
this famous America.

32:15.706 --> 32:20.201
- Where are you staying?
- I came to find you.

32:20.309 --> 32:23.855
I sent you an eletronic post -
an E-mail!

32:24.456 --> 32:26.056
Oh my God!

32:27.968 --> 32:30.212
Wait a minute!

32:33.065 --> 32:35.801
They're crazy in this country!

33:16.883 --> 33:19.118
What the hell!

33:22.919 --> 33:25.119
Leave him alone!

33:26.119 --> 33:29.819
I'm so sorry!
Cuba just wants to play.

33:30.020 --> 33:31.820
Are you alright?

33:33.692 --> 33:36.386
Cuba wanted to play.

33:36.695 --> 33:38.947
This is my mother.

33:39.248 --> 33:42.648
- Nice to meet you!
- My name is Tanino.

33:45.449 --> 33:48.749
Is this your first time in The U.S.?

33:49.250 --> 33:52.250
First time?
Yes, the first time.

33:52.451 --> 33:54.051
Hey, Easy!

33:54.352 --> 33:58.052
He looks like Aladdin!
Can I play with him?

33:58.253 --> 34:00.153
Honey, Let him go!

34:00.254 --> 34:02.154
- Say you're sorry!
- No!

34:02.255 --> 34:04.155
No problem for me.

34:04.456 --> 34:05.356
Daddy!

34:06.157 --> 34:08.556
Good Morning, my little princess!

34:08.858 --> 34:10.757
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, Daddy.

34:10.859 --> 34:12.958
- Did you make your bed?
- Yes, Daddy.

34:13.060 --> 34:14.159
Good girl!

34:14.460 --> 34:17.460
And here's my big princess as well.
Good Morning!

34:17.462 --> 34:18.362
Morning, Daddy.

34:18.463 --> 34:21.362
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, and I made my bed.

34:21.563 --> 34:23.063
Good girls!

34:25.764 --> 34:29.165
Who's going to introduce
our guest to me?

34:29.466 --> 34:33.065
Good Morning, I take the
video camera to Sally's home.

34:33.266 --> 34:36.867
He's a friend of Sally's from Italy.
His name is Tanino.

34:37.068 --> 34:38.768
Welcome, Tanino!

34:38.969 --> 34:41.168
Nice to meet you, Mr. Garfield.

34:52.069 --> 34:54.369
- So, Tony...
- Tanino.

34:54.469 --> 34:59.170
TaniÃ±o, is this your first time
in The United States?

34:59.371 --> 35:01.171
Yes, first time.

35:01.972 --> 35:04.272
How do you like it here?

35:05.116 --> 35:07.494
Did he ask if I like?

35:07.837 --> 35:12.666
Yes, it's very beautiful, but cold!

35:12.874 --> 35:15.961
Not here!
Here you have heating.

35:16.169 --> 35:20.057
But ouside, cold!

35:20.258 --> 35:23.058
He looks like Aladdin!

35:23.059 --> 35:25.459
- Stop bothering him!
- Cut it out, Jane!

35:25.560 --> 35:26.460
Thanks!

35:27.461 --> 35:31.461
What part of Italy do you
come from?

35:32.262 --> 35:34.862
He's from Sicily, but he
studies in Rome.

35:35.163 --> 35:38.363
- Rome!
- How beautiful!

35:38.564 --> 35:43.364
Yes, it is!
A little traffic, but very interesting.

35:43.365 --> 35:46.165
It's the capital of Italy, you know.

35:46.948 --> 35:47.784
Sure.

35:48.985 --> 35:52.085
Do you go to University there?

35:52.286 --> 35:56.386
Yes, University.
How do you say, Lettere?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.487
Liberal Arts.

35:58.488 --> 36:02.488
- Interesting!
- Yes, very.

36:03.189 --> 36:06.689
What are your job prospects?

36:07.090 --> 36:13.990
How do you plan to use your
Liberal Arts degree?

36:14.111 --> 36:18.823
- He asked what job you'll get.
- Oh me, what job?

36:19.107 --> 36:23.286
I like "Regia", but I'm not sure.

36:23.687 --> 36:25.687
- "Regia"?
- Yes.

36:25.788 --> 36:27.488
"Regia"

36:28.089 --> 36:30.389
What's Regia, cheese?

36:30.969 --> 36:33.663
It's how you say, Direction.

36:33.964 --> 36:37.764
Oh, Direction.
Direction, honey.

36:38.765 --> 36:40.465
That's wonderful!

36:40.766 --> 36:42.866
What kind of direction?

36:43.067 --> 36:45.667
This is the question indeed.

36:49.368 --> 36:51.468
Is he staying with us?

36:51.769 --> 36:53.569
I guess so.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.870
I didn't expect him to come!

36:56.371 --> 36:59.671
Don't be rude.
He's come to see you.

36:59.972 --> 37:04.072
Please, Let's keep him.
He's so cute!

37:04.373 --> 37:10.173
I would like to know exactly what
your plans are for your trip.

37:10.326 --> 37:13.070
What are your travel plans?

37:13.178 --> 37:16.665
- What I plan to do here?
- Exactly!

37:16.873 --> 37:19.354
Exactly, I don't know!

37:19.655 --> 37:21.755
I'll look around.

37:21.963 --> 37:24.291
I'll play it by ear.

37:24.416 --> 37:28.596
"Who lives, will see"
as we say back home.

37:28.597 --> 37:30.097
Honey, I gotta go.

37:30.198 --> 37:32.198
At least where I'm from.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.269
It's beautiful here!

37:39.580 --> 37:42.190
- Make your bed!
- Sure.

37:42.499 --> 37:46.528
In such a friendly climate
between two cultures,

37:46.778 --> 37:49.447
only Sally was hostile.

37:49.656 --> 37:53.451
Uncle Michael was her father's
brother and partner.

37:53.618 --> 37:57.914
"Garfield & Garfield" law firm.

37:58.081 --> 38:02.894
He made small talk with me.
Americans like this kind of talk.

38:03.095 --> 38:05.395
Is this your first time in The U.S.?

38:05.396 --> 38:08.396
Yes, and it's cold outside.
But here is okay.

38:08.397 --> 38:10.697
I go to University in Roma,
the capital of Italy.

38:10.894 --> 38:13.815
A little traffic, but wonderful.

38:14.816 --> 38:16.016
Great!

38:16.617 --> 38:20.417
Michael, we have to go.
Bye-Bye!

38:27.069 --> 38:32.065
They all had things to do.
They left me with little Jane and...

38:32.132 --> 38:36.645
the nanny from Guatemala, who
thought I'd steal her job.

38:36.828 --> 38:40.225
I think she put a curse on me.

38:43.777 --> 38:50.548
I tried to show my sympathy for
Central Americans, but it was no use.

38:51.136 --> 38:56.540
On the first day, she asked why I had come
to this strange country.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.941
Is that him?

40:11.242 --> 40:12.942
Yes, that's him.

40:13.743 --> 40:15.843
He's an idiot!

40:16.244 --> 40:18.544
I feel terrible.

41:11.608 --> 41:13.510
How are you?

41:14.211 --> 41:18.072
Good!
Excuse, it's an important moment.

41:22.594 --> 41:26.581
I just wanted to tell you that
Peter is my boyfriend.

41:27.482 --> 41:29.682
No problem!

41:33.221 --> 41:36.007
What's his name?

41:36.216 --> 41:39.944
- Peter.
- Very typical American boy.

41:41.655 --> 41:44.808
Sorry if I disappointed you.

41:45.133 --> 41:48.437
Yeah well, nobody's disappointed here.

41:48.638 --> 41:50.038
Are you disappointed?

41:50.238 --> 41:53.838
Would you stop it!
I can't hear anything.

41:54.226 --> 41:56.528
Excuse us!

42:02.033 --> 42:07.038
At that point, it didn't make sense
for me to stay.

42:07.205 --> 42:10.567
I thought I'd go but didn't
know where.

42:10.834 --> 42:15.514
I was sick, but Mrs. Leslie
took care of me.

42:15.781 --> 42:18.209
One day I was alone.

42:18.334 --> 42:22.345
Mr Garfield was out of town, Sally at
College, and Jane at day care.

42:22.546 --> 42:24.046
Thank you Mrs. Leslie.

42:24.547 --> 42:25.547
Open!

42:30.548 --> 42:32.748
100ÂºF

42:33.049 --> 42:35.149
100 degrees?

42:35.450 --> 42:38.850
Shhh!
It's okay.

42:40.751 --> 42:42.351
Poor baby!

42:42.752 --> 42:47.052
- So sick and far away from home!
- Yes.

42:47.253 --> 42:49.053
You're so hot.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.376
Yes.

42:52.677 --> 42:55.977
Come here!

42:58.365 --> 43:02.344
- I bet you wish you were at home.
- Yes.

43:04.263 --> 43:07.599
- In your own bed.
- Yes.

43:08.926 --> 43:14.489
Have a nice long sleep, and when you
wake up everything will be better.

43:14.490 --> 43:15.490
Yes.

43:15.556 --> 43:19.611
- You want me to sing to you?
- Yes, Mrs. Leslie.

43:26.652 --> 43:29.231
It was a strange feeling.

43:29.356 --> 43:33.527
With my fever and her scent of vanilla.

43:33.728 --> 43:36.128
I thought she had feelings for me.

43:36.378 --> 43:39.523
I fell asleep dreaming wonderful things.

43:39.632 --> 43:44.551
Like Mrs. Leslie and me in the clouds.
Her revealing her feelings for me...

43:44.676 --> 43:48.647
without any bourgeois hypocrisy.

44:36.798 --> 44:39.302
I have a question?

44:39.510 --> 44:45.166
Why you are sad, Mrs. Leslie?
Sorry for asking.

44:45.467 --> 44:47.667
Me?
Sad?

44:47.900 --> 44:51.537
Maybe not "sad", Mrs. Leslie.

44:51.845 --> 44:55.015
You are very beautiful, with all respect.

44:55.316 --> 44:58.116
You are a very sweet boy.

45:02.517 --> 45:05.017
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

45:06.918 --> 45:08.918
I'll be in our room.

45:09.919 --> 45:11.719
I'll be right there.

45:17.920 --> 45:21.320
Put these on and get back into bed!

45:23.619 --> 45:25.695
Shit!

45:28.949 --> 45:32.911
God only knows what they said.
I stayed awake all night...

45:33.119 --> 45:37.082
to see if something would happen,
but it didn't.

45:37.290 --> 45:40.894
The next morning we all had breakfast.

45:41.095 --> 45:45.295
- Sleep well?
- I slept well. Yes I did.

45:45.596 --> 45:47.996
Good, I hope you feel better.

45:52.998 --> 45:58.093
I thought I'd leave because even though
Americans are open-minded...

45:58.101 --> 46:00.772
and not jealous like us,

46:00.939 --> 46:05.861
Mr. Garfield said something I didn't
quite understand.

46:06.262 --> 46:10.262
You and I should go out together.
Just you and me, okay?

46:12.651 --> 46:16.997
- My father asked you something.
- What?

46:17.205 --> 46:20.484
He said you both should go out later.

46:20.585 --> 46:22.285
Okay, no problem.

46:22.586 --> 46:23.686
Good!

46:25.130 --> 46:27.132
But why?

46:52.133 --> 46:55.333
- Excuse me Mr. Garfield.
- Yeah?

46:56.134 --> 47:00.134
Where are we going exactly?
I don't understand where we're going.

47:00.235 --> 47:03.135
Where are we going now?
It's a surprise.

47:03.136 --> 47:04.136
Surprise?

47:04.337 --> 47:07.737
A surprise, yeah.
Understand?

47:08.238 --> 47:09.838
Don't worry!

47:14.604 --> 47:17.432
I felt something very bad
was happening.

47:17.641 --> 47:21.660
It became clear when Mr. Garfield
opened the trunk.

47:36.767 --> 47:40.167
Excuse me Mr. Garfield.
What is this?

47:40.968 --> 47:43.268
What do you think it is?

47:44.168 --> 47:46.945
It's a rifle.

47:47.304 --> 47:50.206
That's what I thought.

47:51.508 --> 47:53.803
- Let's go!
- Where?

47:53.804 --> 47:55.504
Go ahead!

48:01.777 --> 48:08.315
Giuseppe, I then remembered those
letters from Death Row inmates.

48:08.760 --> 48:16.258
I kept thinking I would die from a rifle
made by imperialistic technology.

48:16.459 --> 48:18.159
How was your day?

48:18.210 --> 48:19.547
Yesterday?

48:19.748 --> 48:21.648
Yeah, what did you do?

48:22.055 --> 48:25.576
Yesterday, I was at your home.

48:25.877 --> 48:27.877
With my wife!

48:29.778 --> 48:33.278
There's a misunderstanding.

48:33.326 --> 48:37.221
Yesterday, I was alone all day.
I swear, Mr. Garfield.

48:37.638 --> 48:41.508
- Alone?
- Yes, stop playing with that rifle.

48:41.716 --> 48:46.088
Yesterday, I had a 100 degree fever.
I was in bed all day.

48:46.296 --> 48:50.067
I swear on my mother.
On my mother!

48:50.268 --> 48:52.668
Where was my wife?

48:52.869 --> 48:56.869
She go out to work.
But not with me.

48:57.315 --> 49:00.243
If you don't believe it, ask her.

49:01.044 --> 49:04.244
- To work?
- Yes, she go with your brother.

49:04.707 --> 49:08.402
Mr Michael.
Garfield & Garfield!

49:08.603 --> 49:10.903
They go with a car.

49:15.104 --> 49:16.704
Okay, Move!

49:17.505 --> 49:18.905
What?

49:19.306 --> 49:22.606
Get out of the way!
It's dangerous!

49:45.813 --> 49:47.913
Here, You try!

49:48.114 --> 49:49.835
No thanks.

49:50.036 --> 49:51.836
Come on!
Give it a shot!

49:51.937 --> 49:55.037
- No.
- It's why I brought you here.

49:55.580 --> 49:58.251
There is the police!

50:01.052 --> 50:03.652
No problem.
I'll be right back.

50:05.684 --> 50:11.548
He was shooting where it was prohibited,
like they do in Napoli!

50:11.856 --> 50:16.785
He got a $100 fine,
which seemed fair to me.

50:29.461 --> 50:33.061
Tanino, where exactly do
you live in Rome?

50:34.062 --> 50:38.057
- What did he say?
- Uncle asked where you live in Rome.

50:38.058 --> 50:39.958
Do you know Prenestino?

50:40.259 --> 50:43.059
Is that near the Fontana di Trevi?

50:43.396 --> 50:47.467
I can practically see it from my window.

50:47.768 --> 50:52.568
That's wonderful!
I love the Fontana di Trevi.

50:53.269 --> 50:56.369
It's such a beautiful spot.

50:56.670 --> 50:59.670
And The Colosseum.
Amazing!

50:59.671 --> 51:03.271
How do you say, Collisio?

51:03.538 --> 51:07.211
Colosseo?
I can see it from the other window!

51:07.561 --> 51:10.665
But only on nice days.
The sunny days!

51:10.866 --> 51:12.166
That's wonderful!

51:12.267 --> 51:17.167
Can you imagine he lives between The
Trevi Fountain and Colosseum!

51:17.268 --> 51:19.568
Yeah, I heard him.

51:21.510 --> 51:26.348
I didn't think The Colosseum and
The Fountain were so close.

51:26.556 --> 51:30.000
Not at first, but there was a lot of
public works.

51:30.151 --> 51:32.938
The Jubilee and the Pope
changed everything.

51:32.939 --> 51:34.639
They moved the Colosseum?

51:34.953 --> 51:38.197
No, you don't understand.
It's difficult to explain...

51:38.398 --> 51:42.198
but when you arrive in Rome,
you can't understand nothing.

51:42.405 --> 51:46.284
Where there was once a public square,
they put a church.

51:46.493 --> 51:51.756
A church, for example.
Needless to mention the lack of parking.

51:51.957 --> 51:53.757
Understand?

51:56.762 --> 52:01.532
It's not my fault if you don't know Rome.
Have you seen the entire city?

52:01.716 --> 52:05.203
You have to trust me a little.

52:05.512 --> 52:09.599
I'll take that chicken thigh if
you don't want it.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.900
- Oh yes, there you go.
- Thank you.

52:12.901 --> 52:17.901
I think your friend is a joker.
I bet he's selling us nonsense.

52:19.502 --> 52:22.902
Yeah, he did the same to me.

52:26.303 --> 52:28.903
What did you tell me about yesterday?

52:28.904 --> 52:33.404
That you had to stay home all day
because our guest was ill...

52:33.605 --> 52:36.905
and needed to be taken care of.
Is that right?

52:37.506 --> 52:43.406
Because our funny young Italian friend
claims that...

52:43.507 --> 52:50.207
my dear little brother picked you up in the
morning, and you were gone all day.

52:54.208 --> 52:58.708
However, when I called you on your
cell phone yesterday,

52:58.709 --> 53:01.009
you said you were in Boston.

53:01.310 --> 53:08.010
Which means you couldn't be here
to pick her up at the same time.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.411
It's logical.

53:13.412 --> 53:17.612
- Don't you think so, Tanino?
- Tanino.

53:20.313 --> 53:23.213
This can only mean one thing.

53:23.514 --> 53:29.614
That you are a liar, my dear friend.

53:39.431 --> 53:42.617
Why does he laugh?
What did he say?

53:43.418 --> 53:46.118
- Larry, please!
- You shut up!

53:50.119 --> 53:53.119
I said, shut up please.

53:53.420 --> 53:56.920
- Daddy are you crazy?
- Maybe I am.

53:57.421 --> 54:01.921
Maybe I am.
Maybe I got it wrong, again.

54:03.722 --> 54:05.722
Maybe you should ask Tanino.

54:06.123 --> 54:08.723
I don't understand what
I should ask him.

54:08.924 --> 54:11.124
Ask him if he was home alone yesterday.

54:11.125 --> 54:15.425
Ask if your mother went out with
your Uncle Mikey.

54:15.426 --> 54:17.426
Larry, don't be ridiculous.

54:17.427 --> 54:20.027
Stop interrupting me!

54:20.628 --> 54:22.428
You see Sally,

54:22.629 --> 54:28.029
It means that they've been screwing
around on me for six years.

54:29.230 --> 54:33.130
Six fuckin' years!

54:33.931 --> 54:38.731
So please ask Tanino about yesterday.

54:40.409 --> 54:44.045
- Did you understand?
- Frankly no.

54:45.481 --> 54:49.885
My father wants to know if
what you said is true.

54:51.837 --> 54:54.514
About the Colosseum?

54:54.523 --> 54:59.627
Is it true my mother went out with
Uncle Michael,

54:59.794 --> 55:02.863
and you stayed home all day?

55:06.210 --> 55:08.587
I was confused.

55:08.812 --> 55:13.091
Why was he jealous at me, but
shouting at his brother?

55:13.274 --> 55:16.845
What could I say to calm
everyone down?

55:35.322 --> 55:39.643
In doubt, I left that America that
I didn't understand.

55:39.910 --> 55:46.353
I flew home... to things that were real
or maybe just fantasy.

55:46.441 --> 55:49.786
You were with me, my friend,
like the old times.

55:49.911 --> 55:53.323
In our usual place,
one day many years ago.

55:53.448 --> 55:58.253
What is our position regarding
the fall of the Berlin wall?

55:58.578 --> 56:04.781
And how will this impact
future generations?

56:04.968 --> 56:07.648
Tanino, what's going to happen?

56:07.773 --> 56:14.170
Giuseppe, I don't understand any of this.
I'm too little.

56:14.271 --> 56:16.271
Where are you going?

56:21.810 --> 56:24.147
You're beautiful.

56:26.498 --> 56:28.942
Father - my life!

56:29.025 --> 56:31.995
How beautiful you are!

56:33.297 --> 56:36.908
What a cute tummy!

56:49.921 --> 56:52.307
Run away, Tanino!

56:52.632 --> 56:56.086
Watch out for those guys.
Run away, Tanino!

56:56.211 --> 56:58.005
Run, but where?

56:58.371 --> 56:59.950
Where?

57:00.351 --> 57:01.851
Dad, answer me!

57:01.975 --> 57:02.936
Dad?

58:16.471 --> 58:21.371
Hey!
Are you leaving, Aladdin?

58:21.972 --> 58:25.642
Yes, but it's a secret.

58:25.743 --> 58:26.943
Shhh!

58:27.044 --> 58:29.344
Cross my heart!

58:42.745 --> 58:43.945
Shhh!

58:44.994 --> 58:46.824
Be Quiet!

58:47.925 --> 58:51.025
Stupid dog, get back inside!

58:51.091 --> 58:53.761
- Stop right there!
- Oh Shit!

59:00.328 --> 59:02.627
Hands off Cuba!

59:02.828 --> 59:06.528
Please don't shoot him, Daddy!

59:11.448 --> 59:13.882
Come back, you bastard!

59:17.128 --> 59:19.617
You destroyed my life!

59:20.948 --> 59:23.739
And stole my dog.

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:17.578
- How much is a hot dog?
- $1.25.

01:00:18.108 --> 01:00:20.966
- Is that enough?
- Perfect!

01:00:29.328 --> 01:00:31.819
Come on, Cuba.

01:00:52.308 --> 01:00:54.563
Can I play?

01:00:59.588 --> 01:01:01.257
I want to shoot too!

01:01:01.882 --> 01:01:03.518
I'm open, pass it!

01:01:03.519 --> 01:01:05.019
Pass it here!

01:01:05.577 --> 01:01:08.847
You're not very democratic!

01:01:09.556 --> 01:01:12.350
In the lane!

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:22.051
Thank you!

01:01:34.752 --> 01:01:36.852
Cuba!

01:02:19.618 --> 01:02:22.438
Where am I?

01:02:31.263 --> 01:02:33.739
Mr. Basilio!

01:02:40.271 --> 01:02:42.548
Dad!

01:02:47.654 --> 01:02:49.034
Did I scare you?

01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:53.535
Did you see? it's Basilio.

01:02:53.752 --> 01:03:00.399
Angelo, Franco...What beautiful children!
What beautiful children!

01:03:00.624 --> 01:03:05.087
You're a beautiful boy!
A kiss for you.

01:03:05.296 --> 01:03:09.382
One for your father.
One for your mother.

01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:12.179
Yes, I'll be right back.

01:03:12.387 --> 01:03:15.557
Where are you going?
Did you have to leave?

01:03:15.682 --> 01:03:18.059
Sorry, I don't understand you.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:24.360
Angelo! Santa! Rosa! Rosario! Rosetta!

01:03:24.513 --> 01:03:26.876
The boy's awake!

01:03:26.927 --> 01:03:32.572
My friend, You know that feeling you get
when you realize you're trapped,

01:03:32.681 --> 01:03:35.785
and can't realize your destiny?

01:03:36.094 --> 01:03:40.089
I should beat you up.
You left us like jerks.

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.093
Come here, traitor!

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.424
You're back!

01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:52.093
I was brought unconscious
to the hospital.

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:57.571
They searched my pockets and found
Li Causi's business card.

01:03:57.708 --> 01:04:02.112
Her name is Marinella,
like your mother!

01:04:02.321 --> 01:04:05.816
- Guess who?
- Hello... Momma!

01:04:05.899 --> 01:04:08.521
Yes, They're very kind.

01:04:08.622 --> 01:04:11.522
- Do you know them?
- Marinella!

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:18.045
A nice snack will fill you up.

01:04:18.362 --> 01:04:23.250
We have the things you brought
from Castelluzzo.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:27.320
- A young man needs to eat!
- Eat!

01:04:27.504 --> 01:04:32.626
I wrote a little report on the Li Causi family.
I'll show you it some day.

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:34.521
They're a huge family.

01:04:34.747 --> 01:04:40.725
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives,
cousins, in-laws, aunts, uncles, etc.

01:04:40.851 --> 01:04:43.311
I still don't get them.

01:04:43.436 --> 01:04:49.349
They own 3 or 4 pizzerias
that are always open.

01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:51.846
They work day and night.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:56.149
They seem rich, but I think
it's just an illusion.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:05:01.794
Sometimes the men get together
to talk serious business.

01:05:02.033 --> 01:05:05.833
Then they give each other kisses
and seem happy.

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:08.128
Maybe they're not so bad.

01:05:08.253 --> 01:05:12.507
They just come from the poorest
of our country.

01:05:12.591 --> 01:05:16.694
They work hard and have nice clothes,
a new car,

01:05:16.895 --> 01:05:19.095
and a fat wife.

01:05:19.573 --> 01:05:25.943
A college guy like you would make it
easily in America.

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:29.091
- Nice cut, Perfect!
- Beautiful!

01:05:29.241 --> 01:05:33.904
I paid $1,000 for it in 1981.
I was skinny.

01:05:34.212 --> 01:05:36.026
Do I have to wear this?

01:05:36.027 --> 01:05:39.327
- Do you know where we're going?
- No.

01:05:39.493 --> 01:05:42.146
- Then you don't listen.
- It's a party, no?

01:05:42.413 --> 01:05:46.316
Yeah, Santa Rosalia party.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:50.094
What's so funny?

01:06:01.564 --> 01:06:04.726
How you've grown!

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:26.723
No thanks, but I'm a little hungry.
Do you have any appetizers?

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:32.112
- Sorry, I no speak Italian.
- No Problem.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.716
Italian waiters are an endangered species.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.588
Now we're designers, architects,
marketers...

01:06:39.889 --> 01:06:41.789
Exactly!

01:06:42.055 --> 01:06:45.642
- What do you do here?
- Me?

01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:50.772
- Let me guess. You're creative.
- In a certain sense.

01:06:51.022 --> 01:06:53.078
- Are you a writer?
- Somewhat.

01:06:53.279 --> 01:06:54.979
Stories?

01:06:55.386 --> 01:07:02.031
Projects, with the intention of realizing
them through audio-visuals.

01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:05.370
- A film maker!
- Hopefully.

01:07:05.579 --> 01:07:08.632
Giuliana De Marco,
Medieval Studies at Brown.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.994
Tanino Mendolia,
I'm a guest here.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:17.215
You're smart to have left Italy.
Life's hard there.

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:21.986
Though it's odd that so many
of us succeeded here.

01:07:22.294 --> 01:07:27.082
It'd make a good subject for an
Altman film, no?

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:31.824
Absolutely!

01:07:32.025 --> 01:07:35.425
Come on, we don't want to
miss Buddy.

01:07:40.308 --> 01:07:43.505
Buddy! Buddy!

01:07:44.028 --> 01:07:46.019
Thank you!

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.620
I'm not gonna stand up here and
say something boring.

01:07:49.721 --> 01:07:51.821
Tonight is a time for fun.

01:07:52.022 --> 01:07:54.122
I just want to say one thing...

01:07:54.544 --> 01:07:59.274
Thanks, my friends!
My heart is all Italian.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:02.486
Viva! Viva! Viva!

01:08:09.726 --> 01:08:13.063
- Do you know him?
- He's the mayor.

01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:17.200
Carmine "Buddy" Omobono.
100% Casertano.

01:08:17.367 --> 01:08:20.113
He got off twice for corruption.

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:24.115
He's nice enough. These people here
re-elected him.

01:08:24.323 --> 01:08:28.528
You should pay attention to his
wife and daughter.

01:08:38.705 --> 01:08:42.975
- You're a hit.
- Me? No.

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:48.008
Should I give you some space?

01:08:48.116 --> 01:08:51.446
- No, She's scary!
- No, the poor girl!

01:08:51.447 --> 01:08:54.747
You know someone he really fears?

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:59.782
The guy with the glasses?
He looks shifty alright.

01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:04.252
The professor?
He's Director of the Italian Institute.

01:09:04.362 --> 01:09:07.224
- The one behind him.
- Li Causi.

01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:09.828
- You know him?
- Just his name.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:15.283
He escaped from Sicily 20 years ago,
after a bloody feud.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:25.702
- Is he calling you?
- I don't think so.

01:09:27.845 --> 01:09:30.032
You know each other!

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.943
- Excuse me!
- Where are you going?

01:09:34.236 --> 01:09:37.439
- Hey Tanino!
- Having a good time?

01:09:37.848 --> 01:09:40.294
I'm calling you forever!

01:09:40.495 --> 01:09:44.295
- You're lucky! Come here!
- Buddy asked for you.

01:09:44.402 --> 01:09:48.116
- For me?
- His daughter wants to meet you.

01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:53.787
- It's love at first sight.
- I told her you just graduated.

01:09:53.997 --> 01:09:56.944
- What should I say?
- I'll introduce you.

01:09:57.145 --> 01:10:00.445
You just say something nice
to the daughter.

01:10:00.652 --> 01:10:02.272
I don't feel like it.

01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:08.512
Are you joking, boy?
This is the daughter of Buddy Omobono!

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.234
- You want to disappoint your mother?
- No.

01:10:12.335 --> 01:10:13.935
And us too?

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.697
- Nice to meet you.
- Speak Italian!

01:10:17.898 --> 01:10:19.698
It's an honor.

01:10:20.098 --> 01:10:23.151
- Do you like Seaport?
- Immensely.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.865
- Did you meet my daughter Angelina?
- I haven't had the pleasure.

01:10:29.066 --> 01:10:31.366
Say, Hi.
Don't be shy!

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:35.131
- She's scared to speak Italian.
- I'm not shy!

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:36.732
It's a pleasure!

01:10:36.881 --> 01:10:38.984
He wants to ask her out.
Right?

01:10:39.085 --> 01:10:42.785
- Yes, if you want...
- You can have a cup of coffee!

01:10:42.912 --> 01:10:47.425
- I can't drink coffee!
- She suffers from Tachycardia.

01:10:47.592 --> 01:10:52.806
- But she likes ice cream.
- I love ice cream!

01:10:53.014 --> 01:10:58.653
- So we'll go one day.
- One day? Tomorrow afternoon!

01:10:58.962 --> 01:11:04.276
- Is tomorrow okay?
- Okay! Thank you so much!

01:11:04.577 --> 01:11:06.277
Take a picture!

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:09.275
What was happening to me?

01:11:09.476 --> 01:11:14.576
I was throwing away everything
I believed in.

01:11:14.936 --> 01:11:19.124
I was becoming a shameless
hunter of dowry.

01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:24.171
I was the understudy of this goon,
but it didn't bother me.

01:11:24.379 --> 01:11:31.183
It was like my DNA was hiding a mafia
trait that was now emerging.

01:11:31.344 --> 01:11:34.955
A voice inside me was saying,
"Screw it!"

01:11:35.264 --> 01:11:42.218
Teach a lesson to the Puglies, Sally,
and even you, my friend.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:48.768
Marry the fat girl, get the house and pool,
and take a mistress.

01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:53.166
Love is only a bourgeois concept.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:57.996
Hooray for Free Trade!
I loved this America.

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:03.006
- Do you like?
- Yes, I love italian ice cream!

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:04.399
Great!

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:08.273
- This is a nice place.
- It's great!

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.561
Do you like Seaport?

01:12:10.662 --> 01:12:14.862
Yes, Seaport is very nice.
Everybody's okay, no problems.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:17.449
I'm happy.

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:22.450
Very good!

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.351
Do you want mine?

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.833
- You're so kind. Thank you!
- You're welcome!

01:12:34.034 --> 01:12:37.534
You are also kind.
Everything's okay?

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:42.582
The main point was to agree with her,
and the ice cream was no problem.

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:47.838
Our first little differences arose
at the cinema.

01:12:57.256 --> 01:13:00.433
Wow! This movie is excellent!

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:04.780
I prefer more intellectual films.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:06.452
What movies?

01:13:06.553 --> 01:13:09.753
My favorite director is Chinawsky,
but I doubt...

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.046
I'm sorry. Teach me!

01:13:12.355 --> 01:13:16.692
Why? You don't even like these directors.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.004
I want to do everything Tanino likes.

01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:23.999
I had mixed feelings about this girl.

01:13:24.207 --> 01:13:29.838
She bugged me, and I only tolerated her
because of my sinister plan.

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:35.877
But she also provoked feelings of
pity and even affection.

01:13:38.305 --> 01:13:41.766
- Night, Tanino.
- Goodnight, Angelina.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:47.564
- Can you give me a kiss?
- Sure of course.

01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:52.845
- Thank you so much!
- You're welcome.

01:13:53.268 --> 01:13:56.123
- See you tomorrow!
- Until tomorrow.

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.779
- And so?
- It went okay.

01:14:24.779 --> 01:14:25.978
- How was the film?
- Did you kiss?
- And so?
- It went okay.

01:14:25.978 --> 01:14:28.579
- How was the film?
- Did you kiss?

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:30.390
A goodnight kiss?

01:14:30.491 --> 01:14:33.091
Did you see the house they have?

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:40.232
- Tomorrow take her to the restaurant.
- And pull out The Big Salami!

01:14:41.326 --> 01:14:45.330
This shameful play was reaching
its final act.

01:14:45.455 --> 01:14:49.417
They told me to talk intimately.

01:14:49.626 --> 01:14:55.287
I told her my mother was a Libra,
and I once had meningitis.

01:14:55.465 --> 01:15:01.187
She said she had acne, and snored
because of her retainer.

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:07.907
According to American dating rules,
"What's going to happen, will happen!"

01:15:08.061 --> 01:15:13.483
I asked myself, How could this happen?
And then it happened.

01:15:14.184 --> 01:15:15.784
Goodnight!

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.543
Are you crazy?
What if your parents see us?

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:25.729
They're not home.

01:15:25.996 --> 01:15:29.056
I'm all alone tonight.

01:16:28.202 --> 01:16:30.902
- Thank you!
- Why?

01:16:31.403 --> 01:16:37.859
Nobody's ever been nice with me.
They all behaved badly.

01:16:38.151 --> 01:16:41.996
- Thank you, Tanino.
- Don't cry!

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:47.827
- What are you doing?
- Please!

01:17:16.928 --> 01:17:19.428
- Goodnight, Sir!
- Goodnight, Leroy!

01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:23.229
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Sure!

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:30.230
- Thank you.
- Your welcome, Sir.

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:36.125
Goodnight!

01:17:36.626 --> 01:17:39.797
Giuseppe, I felt strange.

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:44.333
I was happy for a job well done,
but at the same time bitter.

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:47.604
For I had become corrupted.

01:17:47.813 --> 01:17:52.417
I felt like an anti-hero,
cynical yet romantic.

01:17:58.518 --> 01:18:00.218
And now Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:18:00.319 --> 01:18:03.819
Please welcome Angelina Omobono.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.620
The mayor's beautiful daughter,
who will inaugurate our project.

01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:11.721
Go ahead Miss Angelina!

01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:18.922
Very good! Thank you!

01:18:18.923 --> 01:18:21.423
Thank you, Miss Angelina!

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:38.524
And now it gives me great pleasure
to introduce our beloved mayor,

01:18:38.525 --> 01:18:41.625
Mr. Carmine Omobono

01:18:41.726 --> 01:18:46.926
Better known as
The Buddy of Seaport.

01:18:54.527 --> 01:18:58.627
When I was a child, my father used to
bring me to the seaside.

01:18:58.728 --> 01:19:02.028
Not too far from here.

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:07.551
I don't believe it!

01:19:07.634 --> 01:19:11.013
I'm with some friends from Castelluzzo.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.559
How are you?

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.960
You made a huge mess and
then you ran off.

01:19:16.067 --> 01:19:19.671
Your father was jealous of
me and your mother.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.808
Nothing happened. I swear!

01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:27.203
It's not my fault if she liked me.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.814
I didn't understand.

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:33.660
- It must've been embarrassing.
- Horrible!

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:38.623
Mother left my father.
And he went to live with him.

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:43.478
- With who?
- My Uncle Michael.

01:19:43.586 --> 01:19:48.415
Then Dad discovered everything
you said was true.

01:19:50.943 --> 01:19:53.362
Maybe it's better like this.

01:19:54.181 --> 01:19:56.166
Sure!

01:19:56.675 --> 01:20:00.103
Poor Dad!
He's alone with Cuba.

01:20:00.312 --> 01:20:03.806
Oh, the dog came back!

01:20:04.649 --> 01:20:08.094
And you and the American boy?

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:15.441
It's strange to see you here with these
people, in these clothes.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.215
You've changed.

01:20:18.316 --> 01:20:21.116
Sally, What can I say?

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:23.744
Are you happy?

01:20:26.939 --> 01:20:30.516
Well... That's life!

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:35.639
This is yours.
It's why I came to America.

01:20:35.847 --> 01:20:39.342
It doesn't matter. You keep it.
It's my gift.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:43.329
- Tanino!
- Just a minute.

01:20:43.647 --> 01:20:47.367
- Please excuse me.
- You have to go.

01:20:51.204 --> 01:20:53.365
Bye, Tanino!

01:20:54.133 --> 01:20:55.993
Bye, Sally!

01:20:56.327 --> 01:20:59.771
Tanino, Why don't you answer?

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.990
Dad's waiting for us by the buffet.

01:21:03.434 --> 01:21:05.420
Who's that girl?

01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:09.921
She's someone I loved very much.

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:15.886
- Let's do this stupid buffet!
- Tanino, Wait for me!

01:21:17.287 --> 01:21:21.087
SPC NEWS, SEAPORT...

01:21:42.633 --> 01:21:46.233
What's your problem?
You want to leave me?

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:49.588
If you put it that way, yes.

01:21:49.796 --> 01:21:53.108
- You can't!
- Why can't I?

01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:55.211
Everything's settled.

01:21:55.212 --> 01:21:58.212
Dad says we're engaged now.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.182
I can change my mind.

01:22:00.265 --> 01:22:03.267
Impossible!
Where would you go?

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:06.396
You have no job, no money!

01:22:06.597 --> 01:22:11.197
We're giving you a big opportunity.
That's our deal.

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:16.698
- You understand our agreement?
- What agreement?

01:22:16.907 --> 01:22:21.661
Don't be a child!
Without us, you're nothing.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:26.474
Without me, you're just a poor,
starving Italian.

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:30.978
- What did you say?
- A poor, starving Italian!

01:22:31.205 --> 01:22:34.883
A poor, starving Italian?
Let me tell you something.

01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:40.180
You're a spoiled little bitch!
Also mafiosa.

01:22:40.347 --> 01:22:44.810
I hate your house, your clothes
and your family.

01:22:44.918 --> 01:22:48.805
You're rich, but you're trashy
and ridiculous.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:51.432
Ridiculous, Funny!

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.078
You're crazy.

01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:58.079
- Shut up and come back, Asshole!
- Let go!

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.980
Don't make me look like an idiot!

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:03.081
Let go!

01:23:04.921 --> 01:23:11.399
Now you be a good boy and go back
and tell everyone you're sorry.

01:23:11.608 --> 01:23:13.638
Understand?

01:23:14.164 --> 01:23:17.276
I don't know what came over me.

01:23:17.443 --> 01:23:20.762
Maybe my vision was blurry.

01:23:20.971 --> 01:23:25.967
But my reaction changed
my life forever.

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.880
Look!

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:41.324
What have I done?

01:23:48.115 --> 01:23:50.815
Get that son of a bitch!

01:23:58.716 --> 01:24:00.716
Daddy, help me!

01:24:00.818 --> 01:24:06.918
The Mayor's daughter has just been
assaulted by her Italian boyfriend.

01:25:49.819 --> 01:25:52.919
Come back, you little shit!

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:57.220
Watch your head, asshole!

01:25:58.521 --> 01:26:00.721
Ah, Jesus!

01:26:05.844 --> 01:26:09.848
Dear friend, rest assured that
I didn't die there.

01:26:09.973 --> 01:26:12.767
Otherwise I wouldn't be writing this.

01:26:12.851 --> 01:26:19.355
I didn't know where that train took me,
but it seemed familiar.

01:26:35.444 --> 01:26:40.044
Excuse me, What's the name
of this city?

01:26:40.045 --> 01:26:44.582
- Is it Boston or is it Seaport?
- Boston?

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.583
- What is he talkin' about?
- I don't know.

01:26:47.684 --> 01:26:49.584
This is Manhattan!

01:26:49.685 --> 01:26:51.585
Ah, Manah!

01:26:52.886 --> 01:26:54.586
He's homeless.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.362
But it's still America, no?

01:26:57.529 --> 01:27:00.624
Come on guys, be nice!

01:27:01.033 --> 01:27:03.235
Is it still America?

01:27:03.736 --> 01:27:07.436
He's crazy!

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:25.063
When I realized where I was,
it sent a shiver up my spine.

01:27:26.525 --> 01:27:31.529
Maybe I shivered also because
I was cold.

01:27:37.108 --> 01:27:42.907
Oh, Mother...!
Sam, Where's my jacket?

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:48.202
- What are you talkin' about?
- It's freezing. Give me my jacket!

01:27:48.303 --> 01:27:49.703
Fuck off!

01:28:28.108 --> 01:28:30.321
Some water.

01:28:30.622 --> 01:28:34.422
A glass of water... normal.
From the tap.

01:28:38.068 --> 01:28:41.560
- Anything else?
- No.

01:28:41.828 --> 01:28:44.320
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:32.219
Bravo!

01:29:40.048 --> 01:29:45.240
Any questions for Mr Chinawsky?

01:30:15.188 --> 01:30:20.943
Excuse me Mr Chinawsky,
You are great! Can I...

01:30:21.548 --> 01:30:23.220
Thanks!

01:30:37.491 --> 01:30:42.761
Mr Chinawsky!
Here's a taxi for you.

01:30:48.568 --> 01:30:51.746
It was a great honor for me.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:57.547
- Ain't you coming?
- With you? If you don't mind.

01:30:58.848 --> 01:31:02.148
- Washington Square please!
- Okay.

01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:03.949
Where are you going?

01:31:04.050 --> 01:31:08.550
My name is Tanino. I come from Italy.
I love your films.

01:31:08.751 --> 01:31:10.851
Italy, Beautiful!

01:31:10.952 --> 01:31:14.252
Yes, it's a beautiful country.
Full of contradiction, but...

01:31:14.353 --> 01:31:16.753
I was in Pesaro.

01:31:17.155 --> 01:31:20.367
I love Tortellini and Sangiovese.

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:24.204
Tortellini, Lasagne, baked pasta,
are great.

01:31:24.405 --> 01:31:26.605
And Italian women!

01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:31.128
Italian women are very dangerous.

01:31:31.336 --> 01:31:35.089
Yes, that's right. Very, very much.

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:47.790
Okay, bye!

01:31:50.491 --> 01:31:56.391
But...Mr Chinawsky, I don't have
money for the taxi.

01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:59.992
Excuse me!
Misunderstanding.

01:32:32.632 --> 01:32:36.436
- You are very nice...
- Tanino.

01:32:36.537 --> 01:32:38.037
Tanino.

01:32:38.338 --> 01:32:43.738
Incredible experience, Mr Chinawsky!
Very incredible!

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:47.662
Excuse me Mr Chinawsky,
Can I video?

01:32:53.663 --> 01:32:56.363
You're a film maker!

01:32:56.764 --> 01:32:58.964
Let me see!

01:33:05.322 --> 01:33:10.983
- Excuse me, but it's the other way.
- Yes, I know.

01:33:14.284 --> 01:33:17.684
Pan slowly... Tanino.

01:33:17.927 --> 01:33:23.990
Hey Giuseppe, Chinawsky's filming me!
It's incredible!

01:33:25.492 --> 01:33:29.437
- Thanks.
- Incredible, Thank you!

01:33:30.914 --> 01:33:34.167
Giuseppe, it was unforgettable.

01:33:34.334 --> 01:33:38.547
I've never sat face to face with
a great artist like him,

01:33:38.672 --> 01:33:42.593
who must fight not to be forgotten.

01:33:42.718 --> 01:33:47.497
Not to mention his financial hardship.

01:33:47.798 --> 01:33:49.698
That was good.

01:33:49.899 --> 01:33:54.199
I'll pay you back when I get the money
from the University.

01:33:54.262 --> 01:34:00.581
Forget it! I just want to learn from
you. You're my maestro!

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:03.102
Okay, we'll make a film together.

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:05.758
A beautiful film!

01:34:06.259 --> 01:34:10.659
You are a film maker!
You have a camera.

01:34:10.953 --> 01:34:16.440
We'll make a film.
Come on! I want to go home.

01:34:16.549 --> 01:34:20.203
Did you mean we'll direct a
film together?

01:34:20.311 --> 01:34:21.540
Yes.

01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:27.541
- Here we are, Tanino!
- You live here?

01:34:37.731 --> 01:34:40.092
This is different!

01:34:40.658 --> 01:34:43.111
I'm cold.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:49.250
Should I write the theme and scenario?

01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:53.330
Hush Tanino, Thanks!

01:34:53.538 --> 01:34:55.740
You're welcome!

01:34:59.328 --> 01:35:01.505
My friend!

01:35:03.674 --> 01:35:07.052
I'm flattered, Mr Chinawsky.

01:35:07.219 --> 01:35:09.572
Shh! Thanks.

01:35:09.839 --> 01:35:13.751
Thank you for believing in me.

01:35:22.526 --> 01:35:28.214
For the film, can I write about
my past experiences?

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:31.215
Mr Chinawsky?

01:35:41.616 --> 01:35:44.916
Dear Giuseppe...

01:35:55.693 --> 01:36:00.556
So my friend, I've updated you with
my American adventure, but...

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:07.027
I must go now because I need to write
down some ideas for the film.

01:36:07.377 --> 01:36:09.807
I can't wait for tomorrow.

01:36:10.015 --> 01:36:13.669
Warm Regards from this
wonderful world.

01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:16.271
Life is beautiful.

01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:19.324
Your friend, Tanino.

01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:38.501
Mr Chinawsky, it's 11 O'Clock.

01:36:38.902 --> 01:36:40.602
Eleven!

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.940
Maestro!

01:36:44.357 --> 01:36:48.937
It's eleven. It's late.

01:36:50.428 --> 01:36:52.037
Mr Chinawsky!

01:36:52.338 --> 01:36:54.338
Mr Chinawsky!

01:36:54.985 --> 01:37:00.089
Are you okay?
What should I do?

01:37:06.308 --> 01:37:09.964
Seymour Chinawsky... Is that right?

01:37:10.168 --> 01:37:13.097
Yes, a famous film director.

01:37:13.508 --> 01:37:19.860
- Yeah sure. Who are you?
- Mendolia Gaetano from Castelluzzo, ltaly.

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:21.756
- Sorry?
- Mendolia.

01:37:21.868 --> 01:37:25.521
"M" as in Marsala,
"E" as in "Enna...

01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:34.433
Why this thing?
Can't he breathe?

01:37:34.724 --> 01:37:39.184
Is he breathing?
I don't understand.

01:37:40.039 --> 01:37:44.142
- Is he dying?
- Please, Mr Mendolia!

01:37:50.628 --> 01:37:53.058
Sit over there!

01:38:18.288 --> 01:38:22.447
Mendolia Gaetano?
Come with us, please!

01:38:25.588 --> 01:38:28.625
Gaetano Mendolia,
You're under arrest.

01:38:28.748 --> 01:38:32.018
Anything you say will be
used against you.

01:38:32.128 --> 01:38:37.262
You have the right to an attorney.
If you need, one will be provided.

01:38:37.468 --> 01:38:40.644
- Understand?
- What?

01:39:16.628 --> 01:39:18.664
Sweet!

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:21.865
- Hello.
- Hi!

01:40:19.282 --> 01:40:24.061
Are you done sleeping?
He always sleeps.

01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:27.315
Give us an autograph!

01:40:27.616 --> 01:40:31.316
- I have to sign?
- Go on!

01:40:32.469 --> 01:40:36.481
You're lucky that the Omobonos
dropped the charges.

01:40:36.731 --> 01:40:40.409
You should thank The Embassy,
and Mr. Li Causi.

01:40:40.576 --> 01:40:43.971
He paid your bail.

01:40:46.283 --> 01:40:50.496
- Am I free to go?
- You're being deported.

01:40:51.104 --> 01:40:54.766
- They must be looking for you.
- So I go home?

01:40:55.075 --> 01:40:59.745
In Italy! You didn't report for
military service.

01:41:01.006 --> 01:41:05.285
- What will they do to me?
- A year in the army won't be bad.

01:41:05.494 --> 01:41:08.897
The Navy has a certain allure.

01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:10.494
Thanks.

01:41:10.595 --> 01:41:14.395
Listen, you need to thank
that man there.

01:41:15.396 --> 01:41:19.396
- It's okay?
- No problem, just leave it with me.

01:41:21.869 --> 01:41:24.154
Mr. Li Causi...

01:41:24.796 --> 01:41:30.409
Now we've paid for this!
1200 dollars!

01:41:32.204 --> 01:41:36.483
When I get back home,
I'll wire you the money.

01:41:36.650 --> 01:41:40.329
What will you pay back?
Your mother's shop?

01:41:40.454 --> 01:41:44.866
The rent for your apartment in Rome?
Tuition money?

01:41:45.075 --> 01:41:50.930
- Will you pay back your life?
- Why do those things matter?

01:41:51.482 --> 01:41:58.203
I thought you were an intelligent boy.
We expected a lot from you.

01:42:00.507 --> 01:42:03.679
What a disappointment!

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.680
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Can you explain?

01:42:10.042 --> 01:42:13.086
What's my life got to do
with this?

01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:17.473
What the hell does my life
have to do with this?

01:42:18.483 --> 01:42:21.544
Easy, boy!

01:42:58.648 --> 01:43:03.987
So it goes, Written and Directed
by Tanino Mendolia.

01:43:04.196 --> 01:43:07.201
It's the story of a boy's adventure.

01:43:07.409 --> 01:43:13.997
It hides a deeper truth that
he doesn't understand.

01:43:14.206 --> 01:43:20.809
When he's about to discover something,
he gets dizzy and confused.

01:43:21.196 --> 01:43:24.257
Maybe that's not clear.
Let's start again!

01:43:24.466 --> 01:43:31.085
It's an autobiography about a boy who
searches for lost time, Proust style.

01:43:31.369 --> 01:43:33.815
No, not exactly Proust.

01:43:34.316 --> 01:43:37.416
Let's start again.
It's the story of a boy.

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:43.873
One day he discovers that things
aren't what they seem.

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:48.240
He doesn't realize it right away.
Not because he's dumb.

01:43:48.365 --> 01:43:54.109
It's the story of a boy's journey.
Incredible things happen to him.

01:43:54.418 --> 01:43:56.248
No, wait!

01:43:56.456 --> 01:44:00.761
It's the story of a boy who escapes
and leaves in a plane.

01:44:01.011 --> 01:44:04.573
In the end he is sent home,
also by plane.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.944
During his travels, there are things
he doesn't understand.

01:44:10.269 --> 01:44:14.899
On the plane home, he looks back
on his journey.

01:44:15.108 --> 01:44:16.518
It's the story...

01:44:16.719 --> 01:44:20.619
He writes this story.
