WEBVTT

00:06.600 --> 00:08.234
We're leaving this apartment tonight.

00:08.236 --> 00:09.852
Mm-mm.

00:09.854 --> 00:12.571
We are. Food.

00:12.573 --> 00:14.248
Bed.

00:16.661 --> 00:19.078
You've got, what, like,
three weeks left in the city?

00:19.080 --> 00:20.543
We gotta make the most of it.

00:20.545 --> 00:22.531
Oh, trust me, this qualifies.

00:22.533 --> 00:25.579
Speaking of food,
I tried to look this restaurant

00:25.581 --> 00:26.588
up the other day.

00:26.590 --> 00:27.648
- Janello's.
- Mm.

00:27.650 --> 00:28.871
Yeah, someone said it was amazing.

00:28.873 --> 00:30.873
- Yeah.
- They don't have a website.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.674
Website? They don't even have a menu.

00:32.677 --> 00:34.510
They serve chicken.

00:34.512 --> 00:35.928
What is with this city?

00:35.930 --> 00:38.380
It's like you're trapped
in some time loop

00:38.382 --> 00:40.349
from 50 years ago.

00:40.351 --> 00:42.885
I got lost yesterday for 30 minutes

00:42.887 --> 00:44.436
in some back-of-the-yards

00:44.438 --> 00:48.023
canary-sparrow-streeter-ville labyrinth.

00:48.888 --> 00:51.193
See, and that right there
is the best part of it.

00:51.195 --> 00:53.395
That weird Chicago pride
that you all have,

00:53.397 --> 00:55.564
even though y'all admit
that this city is too corrupt,

00:55.566 --> 00:57.066
too violent, too cold,

00:57.068 --> 00:59.034
- it's still a great city.
- Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

00:59.036 --> 01:00.569
You're so gonna miss this place.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.749 --> 01:13.215
You gonna get that?

01:21.218 --> 01:23.759
Um, hey, come back to bed.

01:26.764 --> 01:29.064
I swear I didn't plan that.

01:29.066 --> 01:30.933
It's a crime scene.

01:30.935 --> 01:32.401
Right.

01:32.951 --> 01:34.270
Chicago.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.528
What do we got?

01:38.530 --> 01:40.947
Two GSWs to the chest, one to the head.

01:40.949 --> 01:41.898
Chipped.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.400
Gang intelligence's
been here from the jump.

01:43.402 --> 01:44.661
Are we assisting them?

01:44.663 --> 01:47.132
I'm not sure. Gangs didn't call us here.

01:47.906 --> 01:49.740
All right, work the scene
as best as they'll let you.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.375
- Copy.
- Hey, Ray.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.909
Appreciate you coming out.

01:52.911 --> 01:55.295
Looking good for a man who just got shot.

01:55.297 --> 01:57.080
Yeah, I feel good. All healed.

01:57.082 --> 01:59.583
Honest, Ray, I'm not sure how I can help.

01:59.585 --> 02:01.918
I mean, the Gang Unit's already
been assigned to this.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.088
I knew him. His name is John Winton.

02:05.090 --> 02:07.557
He just got out of Stateville
a month ago.

02:07.559 --> 02:09.893
Was a shot-caller
with the Gangster Prophets.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.261
He get picked up in that '04 raid?

02:11.263 --> 02:12.475
Uh-huh.

02:12.477 --> 02:14.147
That's the biggest bust we ever made.

02:14.149 --> 02:17.067
Took down over 75 bangers
in that operation.

02:17.069 --> 02:18.769
Yeah, well, just about all
of them have been getting out

02:18.771 --> 02:20.604
of prison in the past six months.

02:20.606 --> 02:22.606
They're trying to take
the neighborhood back.

02:22.608 --> 02:24.324
The last thing we need
in this neighborhood...

02:24.326 --> 02:25.742
the last thing I need...

02:25.744 --> 02:27.444
- Got fire!
- Let's go!

02:31.450 --> 02:33.617
- 6120, shots fired.
- Body!

02:33.619 --> 02:35.619
We got him! Spread out, find him!

02:35.621 --> 02:37.454
Plainclothes officers on scenes.

02:40.759 --> 02:42.729
Hey, back these cars up!

02:43.629 --> 02:45.345
We're too late. He's already gone.

02:45.347 --> 02:46.630
Block it off.

02:46.632 --> 02:48.181
All right, everybody move back!

02:48.183 --> 02:49.683
Somebody get me some tape
before we trample the scene!

02:49.685 --> 02:51.968
Back, back, back!

02:51.970 --> 02:55.021
Two generations fighting
over one neighborhood.

02:57.017 --> 02:58.692
It's not good.

02:58.694 --> 03:00.610
Yeah, it's called a gang war.

03:16.295 --> 03:19.091
I am not gonna have a 60-shoot weekend.

03:19.093 --> 03:21.131
We stop this bleeding now.

03:21.133 --> 03:23.717
We've got 20 patrol cars en route.

03:23.719 --> 03:25.168
We'll flood the zone with uniforms.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.470
Show of force.

03:26.472 --> 03:27.838
CPIC and Narcotics are in the loop.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.172
They'll offer support as well.

03:29.174 --> 03:31.475
You know Gangs is handling the bodies.

03:31.477 --> 03:33.510
Intelligence can jump on with CPIC.

03:33.512 --> 03:36.646
They'll help identify potential
next shooters and targets.

03:36.648 --> 03:39.483
No. I want intelligence with me.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.163
Working a peace deal.

03:41.487 --> 03:42.903
You know, Ray, last time I checked,

03:42.905 --> 03:44.688
you were still an alderman.

03:46.191 --> 03:48.692
That said, if you do have a valid reason

03:48.694 --> 03:50.494
for this request, I'm all ears.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.078
It's pretty simple.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.031
Hank is the only cop in Chicago
who might actually be able

03:55.033 --> 03:56.283
to pull this off.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.420
I want hourly reports. Understood?

04:00.422 --> 04:01.529
- Understood.
- Good.

04:01.531 --> 04:05.675
Sir, um, gentlemen, can I have a minute?

04:05.677 --> 04:07.260
Please?

04:07.262 --> 04:08.857
Listen.

04:09.047 --> 04:11.548
You want me to try and broker truce,

04:11.550 --> 04:13.216
I'm happy to do that.

04:13.218 --> 04:16.353
But I think we all know there's
no clean, easy way.

04:16.355 --> 04:18.053
I'm gonna have my hands full.

04:18.055 --> 04:20.035
That being said,

04:20.942 --> 04:23.560
the last thing I want
is to be caught in the middle

04:23.562 --> 04:24.895
of your political tug of war.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.530
I live two blocks from here.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.782
I'm just trying to prevent
more bodies from dropping.

04:28.784 --> 04:31.201
- As am I.
- So we agree to a truce?

04:38.076 --> 04:41.461
Now all you gotta do,
go convince the gang bangers

04:41.463 --> 04:42.712
to do the same thing.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.085
- Start with the old-timers?
- Yeah.

04:49.087 --> 04:51.555
You know who's calling the
shots over there these days?

04:51.557 --> 04:54.057
Guy by the name of Eddie Brackton.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.764
Hey, I apologize for the noise.

05:00.766 --> 05:04.037
Saturday mornings,
my mom like to do breakfast.

05:05.923 --> 05:07.771
What's going on, Ray?

05:08.250 --> 05:10.907
Not every day the candidate
for Mayor swings through.

05:10.909 --> 05:12.776
Those bodies last night.

05:12.778 --> 05:15.420
Look, I just got out
of prison three weeks ago.

05:15.422 --> 05:16.880
I know.

05:16.882 --> 05:19.583
If we weren't talking
about dead men and boys,

05:19.585 --> 05:22.035
I might be impressed with your progress.

05:23.622 --> 05:25.622
Now, we're setting a meeting tonight,

05:25.624 --> 05:27.424
and I need you to show up.

05:27.426 --> 05:29.256
We're getting a member
from the younger generation

05:29.258 --> 05:30.927
to show as well.

05:30.929 --> 05:32.851
Like a peace summit?

05:33.966 --> 05:36.466
I didn't realize you
were still doing those.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.468
Don't have a choice.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.972
You saying you need my help?

05:41.974 --> 05:44.744
I'm saying we need to put
an end to the killing.

05:45.477 --> 05:48.645
And the word is you're the
de facto regent on this block.

05:48.647 --> 05:52.148
If that's true,
you'll come to this meeting,

05:52.150 --> 05:54.868
you'll sit down, you'll hear the terms.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.631
We'll hash out a plan.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.634
And why exactly will I do all this?

05:59.992 --> 06:01.791
It's good for business.

06:07.382 --> 06:09.633
Okay, I'll come through.

06:13.138 --> 06:15.504
- If it is to work, Officer...
- Sergeant.

06:17.913 --> 06:22.012
If it is to work, Sergeant,
you gonna have to get someone

06:22.014 --> 06:24.180
on the other side with some real power.

06:27.986 --> 06:29.653
And older than 15.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.993
Okay, this is the four-block section.

06:36.995 --> 06:40.030
Controlled by a new young
faction of the GPs,

06:40.032 --> 06:41.915
but to say control
is really an overstatement.

06:41.917 --> 06:43.199
Yeah, these kids are wild.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.035
They don't observe any rules or bylaws.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.037
Will any of these young guns
stand out from the crowd,

06:47.039 --> 06:48.538
make a name for himself?

06:48.540 --> 06:50.707
No, there's a lot of arrests
for possession.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.009
All right, so follow that. Listen.

06:53.011 --> 06:54.678
If there's kids out there dealing drugs,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.692
that means someone out there
is controlling it somewhere.

06:58.183 --> 07:00.216
I mean, talk to gangs.
Use what intel they got.

07:00.218 --> 07:02.018
Reached out to a few of my CIs.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.964
If we're banking on the drug
angle, they should have a name.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.389
Okay, good. But let's move fast.

07:06.391 --> 07:09.025
We gotta find a kid who can
sit down with Eddie Brackton

07:09.027 --> 07:11.144
before this wave gets ahead of us.

07:12.781 --> 07:13.917
Got it.

07:14.616 --> 07:18.201
Uh, Antonio got a name.
Eric Wilson, 16 years old.

07:18.203 --> 07:22.205
No priors and has a handle
on at least three corners.

07:22.207 --> 07:23.707
Yeah, but I don't see him on the street.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.910
Yeah, well, that's 'cause he's smart.
It's 19 degrees out.

07:28.046 --> 07:29.412
That's one job I don't envy.

07:29.414 --> 07:31.414
Chicago drug runner
in the dead of winter.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.333
Blair, huh?

07:35.227 --> 07:37.060
That still going?

07:37.085 --> 07:38.451
Yeah.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.056
It's been good. It's easy fun.

07:40.058 --> 07:41.611
He's leaving in three weeks.

07:42.310 --> 07:43.593
You good with that?

07:43.595 --> 07:45.061
It's supposed to be a temporary,

07:45.063 --> 07:46.730
no-questions-asked fling.
It's nothing more.

07:46.732 --> 07:47.931
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.579
Hey, our kid's walking up now.

07:51.570 --> 07:54.070
Hey, we got a positive on Eric.

07:54.072 --> 07:55.939
Denim jacket, jeans. Ruzek, you're up.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.166
Hey, man. Hey, my man.

08:06.168 --> 08:08.668
- You're the guy, right?
- For what?

08:08.670 --> 08:10.120
Matty Cumins sent me down here

08:10.122 --> 08:11.788
and told me to talk to you...
to come to this corner.

08:11.790 --> 08:12.956
You're the guy, right?

08:12.958 --> 08:15.341
I don't know no Matty Cumins.
You just keep on moving.

08:15.343 --> 08:17.343
Then maybe you can point me
in the right direction.

08:17.345 --> 08:18.928
Look, whatever you're looking to buy,

08:18.930 --> 08:20.130
ain't nobody selling.
Take that damn Stevenson.

08:20.132 --> 08:21.431
This ain't where you come.

08:21.433 --> 08:22.599
Look, man, I'm just trying to get well.

08:22.601 --> 08:23.800
You know what I mean?

08:23.802 --> 08:25.301
Look, your ears don't work, man?

08:26.688 --> 08:28.521
I'm sorry.

08:31.943 --> 08:35.945
Easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy, easy.

08:35.947 --> 08:38.376
All right? Put your arms up.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.034
- I ain't got nothing on me.
- I don't care.

08:41.035 --> 08:42.899
You're Eric Wilson, right?

08:42.900 --> 08:44.454
Word is you're the shot-caller.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.656
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:46.658 --> 08:48.792
You sell on three corners
of this neighborhood.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.160
Yeah, we know. But we don't care.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.996
Today's your lucky day. We're
not gonna bust you for that.

08:52.998 --> 08:56.299
As long as you come to the meeting
tonight with Eddie Brackton.

08:56.301 --> 08:57.717
I ain't coming to no meeting
just because a couple

08:57.719 --> 08:59.199
of old dudes just got out the joint.

08:59.201 --> 09:00.462
Come on, kid. Then we're just gonna have

09:00.487 --> 09:01.805
to bring you in and book you.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.339
You can't do that, either.

09:03.341 --> 09:05.058
I ain't got nothing on me,
and you ain't got nothing

09:05.060 --> 09:06.309
to arrest me for.

09:06.311 --> 09:08.645
- I know my rights.
- That so?

09:08.647 --> 09:10.879
Think we can manage to come up
with something, don't you?

09:10.881 --> 09:12.849
There's certainly enough
to walk you to a patrol car

09:12.851 --> 09:14.234
in front of all your boys.

09:14.236 --> 09:15.985
Let me tell you,
I'm not gonna put you in cuffs.

09:15.987 --> 09:17.353
I'm gonna walk you out there.

09:17.355 --> 09:19.823
I'm gonna talk to you real nice
like we're pals.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.825
Like we're helping each other.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.660
Kids around here love snitches.

09:35.238 --> 09:37.435
Sarge, it's pretty quiet out here.

09:43.098 --> 09:45.715
I didn't come to no peace summit holding.

09:47.519 --> 09:50.553
All right, Eddie, meet Eric Wilson.

09:54.239 --> 09:55.745
Let's go.

09:56.275 --> 09:57.420
Come on.

09:57.445 --> 10:00.113
All right, tonight,
we're gonna figure out a plan

10:00.115 --> 10:02.533
to square up your territory and make sure

10:02.535 --> 10:04.234
no more bodies drop.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.568
We didn't drop any bodies.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.453
Yeah then who killed my boy John John?

10:07.455 --> 10:08.864
Hey, don't be accusing me, old man.

10:08.865 --> 10:10.231
Calm down.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.866
We're trying to make peace,
not start a fight.

10:11.868 --> 10:14.235
Look, I know what y'all are trying to do.

10:14.237 --> 10:15.954
But that doesn't mean I have
to go along with it.

10:15.956 --> 10:17.238
Well, that's right.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.374
You got free will
to do whatever you want.

10:19.376 --> 10:22.911
But you better understand
that if you don't,

10:22.913 --> 10:25.964
boy, I'm gonna flood this
neighborhood with cops.

10:25.966 --> 10:27.749
They're gonna search your houses,

10:27.751 --> 10:29.384
stand on your corners.

10:29.386 --> 10:30.752
I mean, you won't be able
to sell lemonade,

10:30.754 --> 10:32.387
let alone drugs.

10:32.389 --> 10:34.756
All right, all right,
enough with all that yapping.

10:34.758 --> 10:36.391
Here's the deal I propose.

10:36.786 --> 10:41.062
I won't retaliate against y'all
if I get a guarantee

10:41.064 --> 10:43.565
that none of your boys step
foot on my two blocks.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.101
- Those aren't your two blocks.
- Yes, they are.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.436
And you won't step foot on them.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.607
And he won't step foot on yours.

10:53.944 --> 10:57.278
And nobody... and I mean nobody...
opens fire.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.983
On anyone.

11:01.284 --> 11:04.022
I mean, you two manage to do that,

11:04.755 --> 11:07.622
you can sling all the dope you want.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.452
I'm good with that.

11:18.435 --> 11:19.621
Yeah.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.498
Me too.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.142
Kid! Get the kid!

11:27.144 --> 11:28.443
Get down, get down! Get down!

11:28.445 --> 11:30.145
Lay down on the ground!
Get your head down!

11:30.147 --> 11:32.313
Guys, plainclothes officers in the area.

11:34.618 --> 11:36.151
You good? Anybody hit?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.786
Yeah, no, all good.

11:37.788 --> 11:39.454
I was pinned down. I didn't have eyes.

11:39.456 --> 11:41.823
Help me! Help!

11:44.494 --> 11:46.494
Help! Help me!

11:46.496 --> 11:49.130
5021 Henry,
roll in ambo to the 4400 block

11:49.132 --> 11:50.665
of South Whipple. Female victim.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.050
GSW to the abdomen.

11:52.052 --> 11:53.413
I'm gonna go get something
to stop the bleeding.

11:53.415 --> 11:56.504
- Go.
- Come on, breathe, baby.

11:56.506 --> 11:58.306
It's gonna be okay. Oh.

11:58.308 --> 11:59.474
Police, anybody home?

11:59.476 --> 12:00.675
Stay right here.

12:00.677 --> 12:02.622
Ma'am, I just need some towels.

12:03.396 --> 12:05.180
- Is my sister...
- She's been shot.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.397
We need to get her to a hospital.

12:06.399 --> 12:07.849
She was walking back from the store.

12:07.851 --> 12:09.067
Is she gonna die?

12:09.069 --> 12:10.985
We're doing everything we can.

12:14.074 --> 12:15.690
- You got it?
- Yeah.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.359
Oh, my God.

12:18.361 --> 12:20.495
- Sarge!
- Where's that ambulance?

12:20.497 --> 12:21.830
En route.

12:21.832 --> 12:23.498
5021 Eddie. Give me an ETA on an ambo.

12:23.500 --> 12:26.751
- We need it fast.
- Nikki, no, please!

12:26.753 --> 12:29.170
- They shot my baby!
- Ma'am.

12:29.172 --> 12:31.039
Let's give them some space
so they can work, okay?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.841
One minute out.

12:52.670 --> 12:54.470
Get up.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.240
Y'all better let me
the hell up out of here.

12:59.242 --> 13:00.741
Better what?

13:00.743 --> 13:04.078
Better try that again, you
wanna walk out of here alive.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.746
Calm down, man.

13:06.075 --> 13:07.408
I came here to work out a deal.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.910
- Your people do the shooting?
- Hell no.

13:09.912 --> 13:11.412
You want the shooter,
you better ask this little

13:11.414 --> 13:13.798
- punk ass bitch here.
- What you say to me, man?

13:13.800 --> 13:15.249
Calm down! Back up, back up!

13:15.251 --> 13:18.252
Sit down! Keep your mouth shut.

13:18.254 --> 13:21.055
You know my boys was right outside.

13:21.057 --> 13:23.244
Guessing those were your targets.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.593
So...

13:26.729 --> 13:28.312
One of your boys do the shooting?

13:28.314 --> 13:30.668
It's possible, but I didn't order it.

13:31.401 --> 13:34.318
I got a young woman...
a civilian with two kids...

13:34.320 --> 13:36.237
bleeding out right now, you understand?

13:36.239 --> 13:39.774
So... you're gonna get me a name.

13:44.614 --> 13:47.782
You think you won't. Hmm.

13:47.784 --> 13:48.992
Hey!

13:51.454 --> 13:52.815
I don't get a name,

13:53.456 --> 13:56.757
I'll cut your head clean off
and mail it to your mother.

14:00.430 --> 14:03.464
Look at me. Look.

14:03.466 --> 14:05.633
You think I'm playing?

14:07.470 --> 14:09.165
I'll do what I can.

14:09.639 --> 14:11.227
You're damn right you will.

14:13.443 --> 14:17.311
You, no retaliation. You understand?

14:17.313 --> 14:18.696
I'm supposed to stand back and let him

14:18.698 --> 14:20.314
just shoot up my neighborhood?

14:20.316 --> 14:23.033
You give me 48 hours
or I'll bring you in right now.

14:23.035 --> 14:24.819
Violate your parole.

14:29.158 --> 14:33.377
Fine. But just 48.

14:33.379 --> 14:34.995
Get out of here.

14:34.997 --> 14:36.497
Both of you.

14:36.499 --> 14:37.882
Now.

14:47.677 --> 14:49.677
That wave just got ahead of us.

14:55.735 --> 14:56.992
Hey.

14:56.994 --> 14:58.519
I had to cage them up in your office.

14:58.521 --> 15:00.688
They were driving me nuts.
Good luck with that.

15:02.325 --> 15:04.692
- Sir, Ray.
- Hank.

15:04.694 --> 15:06.360
What in the hell just happened?

15:06.362 --> 15:07.862
You tell me you can set up a meeting.

15:07.864 --> 15:10.247
You tell me that you can ID
the shot-callers.

15:10.249 --> 15:11.615
I did.

15:12.368 --> 15:13.367
Well then who screwed up?

15:13.369 --> 15:15.753
No one, except some kid carrying a MAC-10

15:15.755 --> 15:17.371
who decided to open fire on everyone.

15:17.373 --> 15:20.040
Be that as it may, Sergeant,
I now have two children

15:20.042 --> 15:22.676
with no mother and news vans
circling their house

15:22.678 --> 15:24.011
trying to get interviews.

15:24.013 --> 15:25.379
I'm doing everything I can to help,

15:25.381 --> 15:28.933
but... I'm just an alderman, right?

15:28.935 --> 15:30.050
Not the police.

15:30.052 --> 15:31.886
Watch yourself, Ray.

15:31.888 --> 15:35.389
'Cause I am working real hard
here not to blame the problem

15:35.391 --> 15:37.224
on the leaders of this crime-infested...

15:37.226 --> 15:39.026
Oh, what do you know about
the leaders of my neighborhood?

15:39.028 --> 15:40.561
That is enough. Enough!

15:40.563 --> 15:43.426
We agreed we're not gonna do that, right?

15:43.950 --> 15:45.900
So here's my plan.

15:45.902 --> 15:48.068
Well, first, we do our best to make sure

15:48.070 --> 15:49.787
no more bodies drop.

15:49.789 --> 15:51.739
Then we focus all our attention...

15:51.741 --> 15:56.076
we do whatever's necessary...
to find the punk who murdered

15:56.078 --> 15:57.244
this young woman.

15:57.246 --> 15:58.733
And when we do,

15:59.415 --> 16:02.612
we just parade his ass
down Michigan avenue.

16:03.319 --> 16:04.852
All of us.

16:08.090 --> 16:09.807
Do that.

16:13.247 --> 16:14.895
That son of a bitch.

16:14.897 --> 16:18.148
Chomping at the bit to throw
my black ass under the bus

16:18.150 --> 16:20.880
to pick up a few votes in the process.

16:21.487 --> 16:24.104
Okay, I'm gonna go and see
that girl's family.

16:24.106 --> 16:25.906
See if they need anything, any money.

16:25.908 --> 16:28.075
He's chomping at the bit, huh?

16:30.279 --> 16:32.446
This is not a photo op.

16:32.448 --> 16:34.949
This is what I do. This is who I am.

16:44.176 --> 16:47.962
Boss, young GPs are taking
credit for the shooting.

16:47.964 --> 16:49.763
Got a bunch of social media posts here.

16:49.765 --> 16:52.466
Idiots rapping about shooting
up the barber shop.

16:52.468 --> 16:54.134
Definitely a retaliation hit.

16:54.136 --> 16:55.468
There's nothing specific, though.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.203
We can't ID the actual shooter yet.

16:57.205 --> 16:58.314
And Eric?

16:58.316 --> 17:00.774
Uh, he's claiming he has no name
and that no one's talking to him.

17:00.776 --> 17:02.142
The shooter's probably just
some wannabe banger

17:02.144 --> 17:03.694
looking for attention.

17:03.696 --> 17:05.311
But all wannabe bangers
are looking for attention.

17:05.314 --> 17:06.313
That's the problem.

17:06.315 --> 17:07.333
Ballistics came back.

17:07.335 --> 17:09.650
The gun used was a MAC-10,
matches an unsolved homicide.

17:09.652 --> 17:12.152
I talked to Gangs.
They don't have any suspects.

17:12.154 --> 17:13.654
Hey, I may have something.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.823
POD grabbed an SUV
speeding west two blocks

17:15.825 --> 17:17.992
from the barber shop about a
minute after the shots were fired.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.492
SUV's registered to an Isaiah Young.

17:19.494 --> 17:21.829
- Gang affiliation?
- Young GPs.

17:21.830 --> 17:24.248
- Bring his ass in.
- Okay.

17:27.502 --> 17:30.533
Here you go, Isaiah.
Sit down right there.

17:35.011 --> 17:37.011
Uh, what the hell's going on?

17:37.013 --> 17:39.013
Why don't you tell us?

17:39.015 --> 17:42.683
Okay, I was gonna pick up
my son when two cops threw me

17:42.685 --> 17:44.685
to the ground and handcuffed my ass.

17:44.687 --> 17:46.820
And other than that,
I don't know a damn thing.

17:46.822 --> 17:48.739
You don't know a damn thing
about that shooting

17:48.741 --> 17:49.907
by the barber shop yesterday?

17:49.909 --> 17:50.941
No.

17:50.943 --> 17:53.193
Any reason why your truck
was seen speeding away

17:53.195 --> 17:55.029
100 yards from the crime scene?

17:55.031 --> 17:56.864
I took off 'cause I heard gunshots.

17:56.866 --> 17:58.866
And the idea of dying ain't so appealing.

17:58.868 --> 18:00.167
It's that simple.

18:00.169 --> 18:02.036
No, when a young mother gets killed,

18:02.038 --> 18:03.754
nothing is that simple.

18:03.756 --> 18:05.873
Man, I ain't got nothing to do with that.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.374
What about your fellow bangers?

18:07.945 --> 18:09.927
I'm not in a gang.

18:09.929 --> 18:11.679
That's not what the database shows.

18:11.681 --> 18:13.213
Because that database is racist.

18:13.215 --> 18:14.598
I never been in a gang.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.383
I just lived in the same neighborhood.

18:16.385 --> 18:18.352
A cop probably saw me talking
to some guy I went

18:18.354 --> 18:21.305
to kindergarten with and
decided to put me on that list.

18:22.692 --> 18:26.060
Okay, let's assume
you're telling the truth.

18:26.062 --> 18:28.062
You were still right there
in the middle of it.

18:28.064 --> 18:29.467
What'd you see?

18:30.183 --> 18:31.465
Hmm?

18:32.735 --> 18:34.234
You don't wanna talk?

18:35.788 --> 18:37.071
That's fine.

18:37.073 --> 18:39.168
We'll just hold you for 48 hours.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.241
Hey, man, but I didn't see anything.

18:41.243 --> 18:43.744
I was driving home listening to music,

18:43.746 --> 18:45.212
and all of a sudden I just heard...

18:46.916 --> 18:49.583
So I drove away. Fast.

18:49.585 --> 18:52.086
- Did you see the shooter?
- No.

18:52.088 --> 18:53.554
Did you see anyone on the street?

18:53.556 --> 18:55.639
- Anything at all?
- Not really.

18:55.641 --> 19:00.260
Uh, I saw these two women,
um, walking with groceries.

19:01.764 --> 19:03.097
You saw two women?

19:05.105 --> 19:06.900
Yeah, they were... they were young.

19:06.902 --> 19:08.602
20, 25.

19:17.329 --> 19:19.767
I already told you what I know.

19:20.282 --> 19:22.416
I'm not so sure about that.

19:22.418 --> 19:23.951
What's that mean?

19:25.287 --> 19:27.087
I think you lied.

19:30.459 --> 19:33.010
I think you went with
your sister to the market.

19:33.012 --> 19:35.295
And you were walking back with her.

19:35.297 --> 19:37.535
When that kid started shooting,

19:38.634 --> 19:40.259
you were right beside her.

19:45.307 --> 19:47.503
I ran inside to get help.

19:48.027 --> 19:49.839
To call 911.

19:50.362 --> 19:51.812
I get it.

19:51.814 --> 19:53.947
I would have done the exact same thing.

19:56.819 --> 19:59.557
Alyssa, I need to know
if you saw what happened.

20:00.156 --> 20:02.039
If you saw the shooter.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.770
What difference will it make?

20:05.828 --> 20:08.829
It could be the difference
between finding the killer

20:08.831 --> 20:10.693
and letting him go free.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.802
I'm not involved in any of this.

20:14.804 --> 20:17.337
Those girls are my responsibility now.

20:17.339 --> 20:19.339
I gotta do what's best for them.

20:19.341 --> 20:21.078
I understand.

20:22.228 --> 20:25.012
But I'm guessing you also wanna
find the person that did this

20:25.014 --> 20:27.064
to Nikki in the first place.

20:27.066 --> 20:29.211
Of course I do.

20:29.852 --> 20:32.903
But you don't get to stand
there and try to lecture me

20:32.905 --> 20:34.988
about what's best.

20:34.990 --> 20:38.358
You think you understand this
violence 'cause you show up

20:38.360 --> 20:41.862
when it's over? You don't.

20:41.864 --> 20:44.364
I know this neighborhood
a hell of a lot better

20:44.366 --> 20:45.866
than you ever will.

20:45.868 --> 20:50.370
And I also know you don't
find killers around here.

20:50.372 --> 20:54.258
You just let them walk free, kill again.

20:55.878 --> 20:57.177
You're right.

20:59.098 --> 21:02.216
But people around here don't do
a whole lot of helping either.

21:03.552 --> 21:07.354
So, if you ask me, we're both at fault.

21:12.895 --> 21:15.445
If you cooperate, I will do everything

21:15.447 --> 21:18.065
in my power to get justice
for your sister.

21:23.405 --> 21:25.596
Alyssa, did you see what happened?

21:29.365 --> 21:31.232
Yeah.

21:32.248 --> 21:33.957
I saw the whole thing.

21:42.307 --> 21:43.891
I tell you what I saw,

21:44.518 --> 21:45.864
do I have to go to court?

21:46.107 --> 21:47.190
Testify?

21:48.524 --> 21:49.690
It's possible.

21:49.692 --> 21:52.910
Yeah, well, that's not too
popular in my neighborhood.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.028
I know.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.949
Alyssa, this is a big decision.

22:00.036 --> 22:01.705
And we're not gonna give you the speech

22:01.707 --> 22:05.873
about how it's your duty as a
citizen to do the right thing.

22:06.383 --> 22:09.728
Because ultimately you have
to live with these consequences

22:10.262 --> 22:12.713
whether you cooperate with us
or don't cooperate with us.

22:12.715 --> 22:16.383
So, take all the time you need.

22:24.727 --> 22:26.912
The shooter was young.

22:27.396 --> 22:29.229
Couldn't have been more than 17.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.793
Black jacket.

22:33.369 --> 22:34.962
Blue skull cap.

22:36.072 --> 22:37.590
He was alone.

22:38.574 --> 22:40.741
I saw him get off a bus.

22:45.247 --> 22:50.134
At first I thought I knew him.
That's why I noticed him.

22:53.255 --> 22:54.688
Then what happened?

22:56.642 --> 22:58.277
He pulled out a gun.

22:59.095 --> 23:02.281
Started shooting towards
the barber shop at these

23:02.932 --> 23:05.315
two other guys leaning against the car.

23:07.737 --> 23:10.122
After that, he ran away.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.323
Like a scared little boy.

23:20.332 --> 23:21.532
I think this is him.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.784
It's the only bus Alyssa could
have had eyes on at that hour.

23:23.786 --> 23:24.952
But the kid never looks up.

23:24.954 --> 23:27.087
And he paid with cash so
we can't track a Ventra card.

23:27.089 --> 23:28.956
I've been looking into
the clothes he was wearing,

23:28.958 --> 23:30.791
- but they're pretty unspecific.
- Everything about him is.

23:30.793 --> 23:32.843
He rode the bus two stops
so I'm trying to track down

23:32.845 --> 23:34.678
the other passengers,
but chances are they didn't

23:34.680 --> 23:36.013
notice him either.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.347
We got a clear shot of his phone?

23:37.349 --> 23:38.932
No, but he's a young kid, so I'm guessing

23:38.934 --> 23:40.134
he's on social media.

23:40.136 --> 23:42.821
- So run it with CPIC.
- Yeah.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.639
Do you have a name
on the plate on the car?

23:45.641 --> 23:46.640
- Yeah.
- You do?

23:46.642 --> 23:47.808
Okay, good.

23:49.311 --> 23:50.477
- Hey.
- Blair.

23:50.479 --> 23:51.695
Hey. What are you doing here?

23:51.697 --> 23:53.480
- Hungry?
- Is that lunch?

23:53.482 --> 23:55.983
Yeah, I found this amazing
new place in Logan's Square.

23:55.985 --> 23:57.818
Beef fat friends, heirloom beets,

23:57.820 --> 23:59.119
- Berkshire Pork Shank...
- Let me guess.

23:59.121 --> 24:00.704
They had a website and maybe even a menu?

24:00.706 --> 24:02.093
Oh, nice. Yeah, funny, ha, ha.

24:02.095 --> 24:03.824
Thank you very much.

24:03.826 --> 24:05.292
- You're busy, aren't you?
- I'm very busy, Blair.

24:05.294 --> 24:06.994
All right, how about dinner instead?

24:06.996 --> 24:08.662
Done. Um, I got... I gotta go.

24:08.664 --> 24:09.797
- I gotta go.
- Okay, hey, hey, hey.

24:09.799 --> 24:11.165
Yeah?

24:11.167 --> 24:12.800
Before you go,
I got offered a new assignment

24:12.802 --> 24:15.002
in Chicago so, you know,
I might be sticking around

24:15.004 --> 24:17.304
for a few more months.

24:17.306 --> 24:19.673
- Kim, come on, we gotta move.
- Yeah.

24:19.675 --> 24:22.226
- Let's talk about it at dinner.
- Okay.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.844
Okay.

24:27.516 --> 24:29.683
Social media might be
the crux of today's violence,

24:29.685 --> 24:31.518
but it's also the way to stop it.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.022
That's Instagram.

24:35.024 --> 24:36.490
What faction am I looking at, again?

24:36.492 --> 24:37.908
Young GPs.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.660
They operate four blocks in Englewood,

24:39.662 --> 24:42.362
75th to 71st. Guy's a kid.

24:42.364 --> 24:43.864
They're all kids.

24:43.866 --> 24:45.249
MAC-10 is heavy artillery.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.834
I'm guessing he's been popped before.

24:46.836 --> 24:49.036
At least filled out a gang card.
What bus line is that?

24:49.038 --> 24:51.421
It's the 8. 75th street, 10:18 p.m.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.891
That narrows it.

24:54.101 --> 24:55.926
These kids are getting smarter.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.378
Now they've got multiple profiles.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.596
This might be it.

24:59.598 --> 25:01.431
"You piss on us, we piss on you."

25:01.433 --> 25:03.884
Wrote that 10:17 p.m.
Matches your timeline.

25:03.886 --> 25:06.687
- Yeah.
- Lamar Cooke.

25:06.689 --> 25:09.189
Loosely affiliated with the GPs.

25:09.191 --> 25:11.725
That's a long-ass rap sheet
for a 17-year-old.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.061
Give me one second.

25:15.865 --> 25:18.365
Got a camera right outside
his last known address.

25:18.367 --> 25:19.566
All right.

25:22.905 --> 25:25.239
I'm gonna show you some photos.

25:25.241 --> 25:27.074
When you see the boy
that killed your sister,

25:27.076 --> 25:28.742
just let me know, okay?

25:28.744 --> 25:31.912
Okay, but we all realize I
only saw him for a few seconds,

25:31.914 --> 25:33.914
- right?
- Right.

25:33.916 --> 25:36.416
If you don't recognize him,
you don't recognize him.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.920
Because once you make a positive ID,

25:39.922 --> 25:41.421
it's very hard to run that back.

25:41.423 --> 25:43.257
So take your time.

25:43.259 --> 25:45.277
Make sure you really want
to do this, okay?

25:45.928 --> 25:48.428
It sounds like you're trying
to talk me out of it.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.899
Maybe I am.

25:51.901 --> 25:53.684
Why?

25:56.939 --> 26:01.608
Straight up, uh,
my little brother got involved

26:01.610 --> 26:03.212
in something like this.

26:03.946 --> 26:05.422
It cost him.

26:06.582 --> 26:07.781
Cost me too.

26:14.623 --> 26:16.808
You said something earlier,

26:17.768 --> 26:20.594
about the consequences of not doing it.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.433
If I didn't try to nail this guy,

26:26.818 --> 26:30.637
if I just hid and pretended
I didn't see anything,

26:30.639 --> 26:33.473
I would never forgive myself.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.278
Then let's nail him.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.486
Boss, there's about 15 kids
in there it looks like.

26:46.488 --> 26:48.155
They're fairly heavily armed too.

26:48.157 --> 26:49.623
All right, we got one shot.

26:49.625 --> 26:52.209
We spook this kid,
he's going underground.

26:52.211 --> 26:55.462
So we go in loud and heavy.

26:55.464 --> 26:56.977
Let's move.

27:10.062 --> 27:13.912
Three, two, one, headache.

27:13.914 --> 27:15.092
Headache.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.024
Everybody get down now!

27:24.026 --> 27:25.909
Get down! Everybody down!

27:25.911 --> 27:27.494
Get on the ground!

27:30.366 --> 27:31.665
Stay down!

27:31.667 --> 27:32.699
Hands on your head!

27:32.701 --> 27:33.500
Stay down.

27:33.502 --> 27:35.168
- Hey, look at me.
- Don't move.

27:35.170 --> 27:36.370
Put your hands behind your head.

27:36.372 --> 27:37.337
Behind your head.

27:37.339 --> 27:39.706
All right, we're looking for Lamar Cooke.

27:39.708 --> 27:42.342
You're Lamar, if you're here,
just say hello.

27:42.344 --> 27:44.878
Look at me. Look at me.

27:49.518 --> 27:51.874
Eric, it's good to see you again.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.855
We're looking for your friend Lamar.

27:54.857 --> 27:56.273
He's gone.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.558
- You ain't never gonna find him.
- Huh.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.228
See, I thought you didn't know
who did the shooting.

28:01.230 --> 28:03.397
I lied, dumb-ass.

28:17.546 --> 28:18.795
Bring him in.

28:22.051 --> 28:23.550
Bring them all in!

28:25.554 --> 28:27.254
Don't move.

28:38.569 --> 28:39.743
Get up.

28:41.707 --> 28:43.121
Come on.

28:48.046 --> 28:49.162
Your boys aren't doing any talking, Eric,

28:49.164 --> 28:51.381
and you say you're the boss.
You say you lied to us.

28:51.383 --> 28:53.917
You know Lamar's gone.
You know where he is.

28:53.919 --> 28:55.585
So you know everything, huh?

28:55.587 --> 28:57.637
So that means we get
to charge you with all of it.

28:57.639 --> 28:59.256
Obstruction of justice and murder.

28:59.258 --> 29:00.597
How's that sound?

29:03.225 --> 29:04.978
This is where you start talking.

29:04.980 --> 29:07.564
- The quicker you do that...
- I'm not about to talk to you.

29:07.566 --> 29:09.766
None of this is my problem.

29:09.768 --> 29:10.934
Not your problem?

29:10.936 --> 29:14.271
Yeah. Are we done now?

29:14.273 --> 29:15.605
Can I go back?

29:17.610 --> 29:19.660
I'm done playing nice. Let's go.

29:19.662 --> 29:21.912
What you doing?
Get your hands off me, man.

29:21.914 --> 29:24.365
Come on. Let's go.

29:29.422 --> 29:31.255
I ain't getting in no cage.

29:31.257 --> 29:33.758
Well, I didn't invite you in the cage.

29:34.761 --> 29:38.596
Look, Eric, I understand
where you live, okay?

29:38.598 --> 29:40.765
You want to survive,

29:40.767 --> 29:42.433
you better learn to be tough.

29:45.438 --> 29:46.637
See, the thing is...

29:49.385 --> 29:51.776
When the bullets started
flying at that barber shop,

29:51.778 --> 29:54.985
I caught you, bro,
and you were surprised.

29:55.694 --> 29:57.448
And I think you were a little scared.

29:59.619 --> 30:01.619
So I know you didn't order that hit.

30:02.822 --> 30:06.323
You're no shot-caller, man.
You don't control anything.

30:08.828 --> 30:10.661
So why the hell
are you pinning this on me?

30:11.251 --> 30:13.214
Because I need Lamar.

30:13.587 --> 30:15.666
And I think you know where he's hiding.

30:20.306 --> 30:21.722
So where is he?

30:54.674 --> 30:57.374
Shh. Shh, shh.

31:26.372 --> 31:28.328
Lamar!

31:30.042 --> 31:31.742
You looking for that?

31:33.746 --> 31:36.547
Turn over. Put your
hands behind your back.

31:41.721 --> 31:43.637
Offender in custody.

31:43.639 --> 31:45.414
Copy that.

31:47.977 --> 31:50.394
- Hey.
- The shooter's in custody.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.146
They're booking him
into holding as we speak.

31:52.148 --> 31:52.930
Good.

31:52.932 --> 31:54.231
We release the arrests,

31:54.233 --> 31:55.893
hopefully that ends the shooting,

31:55.895 --> 31:56.984
at least for a while.

31:56.986 --> 31:59.518
And this witness, you're
sure she's willing to testify?

31:59.979 --> 32:02.940
Oh, yeah. This kid's strong.
She'll see this one through.

32:02.942 --> 32:05.815
Okay, I'll convene
a grand jury right away.

32:05.817 --> 32:08.579
The faster we indict this kid,
the better.

32:08.785 --> 32:09.947
I'm glad we were able to work

32:09.949 --> 32:11.615
on this one together, gentlemen.

32:14.272 --> 32:16.138
It makes me proud.

32:22.113 --> 32:23.896
There you go.

32:26.465 --> 32:28.933
This...

32:33.522 --> 32:37.024
Alyssa, this is just us
being extra cautious.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.713
Got the Grand Jury tomorrow,
and naturally the last thing

32:39.715 --> 32:41.322
we want is for anybody
to know you testified.

32:41.324 --> 32:42.529
I get it.

32:42.531 --> 32:44.815
But I don't wanna stay
at this motel for long.

32:44.817 --> 32:46.867
Hopefully it'll only be for a night.

32:46.869 --> 32:48.452
Good.

32:48.454 --> 32:50.988
I don't like being away from home.

32:50.990 --> 32:53.490
Especially now.

32:53.492 --> 32:54.708
Alyssa all set?

32:54.710 --> 32:56.043
Yeah, she checked in 15 minutes ago.

32:56.045 --> 32:57.461
Had a patrol car outside all night.

32:57.463 --> 32:58.662
Good.

32:58.664 --> 32:59.997
Sarge, you guys gotta see this.

33:00.503 --> 33:01.966
See what?

33:02.505 --> 33:04.961
Kelton just released
a statement to the press.

33:04.963 --> 33:06.136
Great.

33:06.138 --> 33:09.173
Thanks to the CPD, Alderman Price,

33:09.175 --> 33:12.557
and the good men and women of Ward 22,

33:13.179 --> 33:15.346
we now have a suspect in custody.

33:15.769 --> 33:18.344
This truly was a team effort,

33:18.346 --> 33:20.401
an excellent demonstration
of what kind of a city

33:20.403 --> 33:24.188
Chicago really is,
as evidenced by the incredible

33:24.190 --> 33:26.824
courage of one citizen who came forward

33:26.826 --> 33:28.359
and identified the shooter.

33:32.999 --> 33:36.700
So, after tomorrow, then what happens?

33:36.702 --> 33:38.702
Then you go about your life.

33:39.292 --> 33:42.206
Until the actual trial starts.
Probably about a year.

33:43.592 --> 33:46.593
But there's a good chance
that that won't even happen.

33:47.050 --> 33:49.429
The kid could get nervous
and plead out to a murder two,

33:49.431 --> 33:51.431
which means that you won't
have to testify in front

33:51.433 --> 33:54.067
of an open court
and no one will ever know

33:54.069 --> 33:55.902
you were actually involved.

33:55.904 --> 33:58.605
Now there are some people who love to say

33:58.607 --> 34:01.324
that the African-American
community doesn't trust

34:01.326 --> 34:03.660
the CPD, doesn't respect the CPD.

34:03.662 --> 34:05.495
But if this case is any indication,

34:05.497 --> 34:08.781
I would say that that
is a gross exaggeration.

34:08.783 --> 34:11.583
Because without the support...
without the cooperation

34:11.585 --> 34:14.786
of the residents of Ward 22
and our brave witness,

34:14.789 --> 34:18.091
we never could have made
an arrest like this.

34:18.092 --> 34:19.792
And that's a fact.

34:19.793 --> 34:21.094
Son of a bitch.

34:21.096 --> 34:23.129
He just put a target on our witness.

34:39.106 --> 34:41.072
I don't understand what we're doing here.

34:42.909 --> 34:45.859
I thought the Grand Jury
was scheduled for 8:00 a.m.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.996
Yeah, we can't have you testify.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.077
What?

34:51.261 --> 34:53.253
It got leaked to the public
that there's a witness

34:53.255 --> 34:54.755
on the case, so...

34:54.757 --> 34:59.259
No... no, that doesn't matter.
I can still go testify.

34:59.261 --> 35:01.228
No, you can't. It's not safe.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.053
And we can't put you
in that kind of danger.

35:05.267 --> 35:07.505
Am I supposed to go get on the train now?

35:08.270 --> 35:11.405
We contacted your aunt.
Got you a ticket to Detroit.

35:11.407 --> 35:13.824
- Some cash for when you get th...
- Are you kidding?

35:13.826 --> 35:16.944
I'm not leaving Chicago.
My nieces are here.

35:16.946 --> 35:19.601
M-my sister's gone now.
I'm what they have left.

35:19.603 --> 35:21.999
- My mother said...
- Alyssa, this is not an option, okay?

35:22.001 --> 35:23.784
- I'm not going!
- Listen to me.

35:23.786 --> 35:26.920
You stay here,
your whole family is in danger.

35:26.922 --> 35:30.424
If they ID you,
everybody you stand next to

35:30.426 --> 35:33.031
is a target...
your grandmother, your nieces.

35:33.762 --> 35:34.845
Straight up.

35:37.967 --> 35:41.802
Yeah, it's gonna hurt like hell
to leave the people you love.

35:43.639 --> 35:47.024
But that pain is better
than the alternative.

35:49.945 --> 35:52.980
I'm sorry this is happening.
I thought we had...

35:52.982 --> 35:54.865
I don't want your damn apology.

36:25.147 --> 36:27.564
Where you been? Is there a problem?

36:27.566 --> 36:29.182
The witness isn't here yet.

36:29.184 --> 36:31.089
She isn't coming.

36:32.192 --> 36:33.520
She's gone?

36:34.320 --> 36:35.572
Let the witness go,

36:35.574 --> 36:37.157
which means you let the killer go.

36:37.159 --> 36:39.526
No, you let the killer go.

36:39.528 --> 36:42.863
We don't have a case
'cause you broke the truce.

36:42.865 --> 36:44.661
Put a target on her back.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.667
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on.

36:46.669 --> 36:48.702
That was not my intention.

36:48.704 --> 36:50.537
I was trying to celebrate all of us.

36:50.539 --> 36:52.172
Ray, I specifically praised you.

36:52.174 --> 36:54.541
- Joint arrest. Joint... Joint victory.
- Wow.

36:54.543 --> 36:55.709
And Hank, I even threw you a bone.

36:55.711 --> 36:56.877
Give me a break.

36:56.879 --> 36:59.346
Yeah, but you held onto that
microphone a little too long,

36:59.348 --> 37:01.214
didn't you? Made it about the election.

37:01.216 --> 37:02.549
- About you.
- Oh, I don't need this.

37:02.551 --> 37:04.351
It's all right,
you couldn't help yourself!

37:04.353 --> 37:06.216
It's who you are! It's your nature!

37:06.218 --> 37:07.480
Hey!

37:14.697 --> 37:17.230
Let me make sure I understand this right.

37:17.232 --> 37:19.366
You're telling me you can't make a case?

37:19.368 --> 37:20.901
Fell apart.

37:20.903 --> 37:24.037
Shooter is being released
from our custody.

37:24.039 --> 37:25.706
I gave you 48 hours.

37:25.708 --> 37:27.240
And I gave you his damn location.

37:27.242 --> 37:28.909
That's right. You did.

37:28.911 --> 37:30.577
And you did nothing.

37:30.579 --> 37:32.506
We're right back where we started!

37:32.508 --> 37:35.612
Eddie, you wanna watch your tone with me.

37:38.587 --> 37:40.420
You know, I spent 20 years
of my life on these streets

37:40.422 --> 37:41.655
in the Gang Unit.

37:41.657 --> 37:43.974
I was probably there
the night they put you away.

37:43.976 --> 37:47.477
You can tell me all you want
about the good old days.

37:47.479 --> 37:50.764
But I was there. I remember them.

37:54.058 --> 37:55.465
This city...

37:56.945 --> 37:59.260
it's always been violent.

37:59.697 --> 38:01.113
Always will be.

38:03.785 --> 38:08.738
But that doesn't mean
that we can't have order.

38:14.412 --> 38:16.045
Rules.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.472
What the hell is that?

38:28.092 --> 38:33.145
That is the details of Lamar
Cooke's release from County.

38:35.650 --> 38:36.942
So.

38:39.270 --> 38:41.678
You say you wanna be the boss?

38:42.273 --> 38:43.739
Shot-caller?

38:45.944 --> 38:47.921
- It's my boy.
- Mm-hmm.

38:52.283 --> 38:54.784
What, this some sort
of trap or something?

38:57.589 --> 39:00.770
Either you take care of it, or I do.

39:03.294 --> 39:05.962
We can't have any more
mothers or kids dying.

39:07.432 --> 39:08.965
No more wars.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.302
And no more peace summits.

39:15.050 --> 39:19.976
We need the cops to go so we
can get back to making money.

39:42.667 --> 39:43.966
Mm.

39:45.003 --> 39:46.669
Is that what you wanted?

39:49.007 --> 39:50.723
It's what I expected.

39:50.725 --> 39:52.308
Mm.

39:52.310 --> 39:54.226
16 years old.

39:59.684 --> 40:03.429
Damn hard, make peace,
you don't know fear yet.
