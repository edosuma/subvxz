<i>'L' is for the way you look at me</i>

<i>'O' is for the only one I see</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:40.577
<i>'V' is very, very extraordinary</i>

01:02.646 --> 01:05.605

02:57.344 --> 03:01.759
<i>Love is more than just a game...</i>

03:01.932 --> 03:03.514
How about a souvenir picture?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.764
Can you turn towards each other?

03:09.564 --> 03:14.730
<i>Love was made for me and you</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:22.488
<i>Love was made for me and you</i>

03:58.363 --> 04:00.821
My God, my phone
just does not work out here.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.404
Oh, my God.
How are we ever going to live?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.449
Thanks!

04:08.623 --> 04:12.458
There's a counselor. Excuse me,
can you tell me where the Navajo bunk is?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.626
It's right over there. You can't miss it.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.665
Welcome to Camp Walden.
I'm Marva Kulp, your camp director.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.084
Now, girls, let's find our duffels
as quickly as we can.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.219
We have a big first day ahead of us.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.224
I'm going to turn the bullhorn over now
to my daughter and right-hand man,

04:28.393 --> 04:32.558
Marva Junior.
Marva, bunk assignments, if you please.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.644
All right, ladies, here we go. Listen up.
We got Berg, Kate - Iroquois.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.277
Berg, Lily - Chickasaw.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.736
Wait a minute.
I thought this was a boys' camp.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.532
Boys?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.789
OK. Found my duffel.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.791
Now the question is, how do I get it out?

05:04.095 --> 05:05.586
OK, I can do it.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.888
OK, no, I can't.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.300
- You must be new.
- How can you tell?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.683
You didn't know how to grab your duffel
before the apes tossed it into the heap.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.349
- I would say you need some serious help.
- Thanks. It's the big yellow one.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.144
Whoa.

05:22.531 --> 05:26.070
- Now that's my kind of woman.
- Yo, tie-dye girl!

05:26.368 --> 05:30.203
Could you give me a hand with my duffel?
It's the yellow one buried way in there.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.445
Sure.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.781
Oh, that? No problem.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.293
Hey. You're from California?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.204
Do you, like, live in Hollywood?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.043
Do you, like, live next door
to a movie star?

05:41.132 --> 05:44.921
What are you two, Lucy and Ethel?
I've never even been to Hollywood.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.212
I live in Napa - that's
in Northern California -

05:47.389 --> 05:48.675
and I live next door to a vineyard.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.510
- A what yard?
- A vineyard.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.009
It's where you grow grapes to make wine.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.096
That's what we do, me and my dad.
We own a vineyard.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.727
- Parker, Hallie!
- Right here.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.687
- Arapaho.
- That's what I am.

06:00.902 --> 06:01.983
Yes.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.570
Come on, you guys.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.571
So, either of you by any chance
know how to play poker?

06:09.744 --> 06:11.531
No, never played it before.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.034
No? Gee, what a shame.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.875
So, how much cash
did you guys bring with you this summer?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.790
Whoa. Who is in there?

06:24.134 --> 06:26.091
Okay, Arapahos. Come on, let's go!

06:37.606 --> 06:39.643
Well, here we are.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.392
Camp Walden for girls.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.853
We traveled all the way
from London for this?

06:46.031 --> 06:49.741
It's rather picturesque, don't you think?

06:49.910 --> 06:53.369
Not exactly the term
I think I would have used.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.745
Right. Shall we review your mother's list?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.124
- Mm-hm.
- Now, let's see.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.784
- Vitamins?
- Check.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.627
- Minerals?
- Check.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.209
- List of daily fruits and vegetables.
- Check, check.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.546
Check for fruits,
check for vegetables. Go on.

07:07.886 --> 07:12.927
Sunblock, lip balm, insect repellent.
Stationery, stamps.

07:13.099 --> 07:17.093
Photographs of your mother, grandfather
and, of course, your trusty butler, me.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.761
Got it all, I think.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.932
Oh, and here's a little something
from your grandfather.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.191
Spanking new deck of cards.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.359
Maybe you'll actually find somebody
on this continent

07:26.446 --> 07:28.187
who can whip your tush at poker.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.658
Well, I doubt it, but thanks.
And thanks for bringing me here, Martin.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.042
Now, you remember,
if you change your mind

07:41.252 --> 07:43.744
and want me to come here
and collect you at the end of camp,

07:43.922 --> 07:47.290
- I'm only a phone call away.
- Thanks, but I'll be fine.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.794
Really. See you in eight weeks,
Marty, old pal.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.009
Missing you already, queen of my heart.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.278
- Have fun, old bean.
- I will.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.368
- Toodle-oo.
- Toodle-oo.

08:23.712 --> 08:24.953
Airport, please.

08:37.142 --> 08:41.260
<i>Such a feeling coming over me</i>

08:42.772 --> 08:47.016
<i>There is wonder in the things I see</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:49.940
<i>Not a cloud in the sky</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.605
<i>Got the sun in my eyes...</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:57.952
Mom, mom! Are you there? Pick up! Mom!

08:58.288 --> 09:01.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls. Slow down.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.582
You've got to have some too, OK?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.204
It smells good.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.915
- I'll save you a seat, Annie.
- OK. Thanks.

09:14.012 --> 09:18.347
Excuse me, girls. I've just got to have
a scoop of these gorgeous strawberries.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.596
- Would you care for some, dear?
- Oh, no, thanks. I can't. I'm allergic.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.561
Oh, that's too bad.
How about you, dear? Strawberries?

09:24.731 --> 09:27.565
Oh, sorry.
I wish I could, but I can't. I'm allergic.

09:27.776 --> 09:32.737
Yes, allergic. You just told me that.
How did you get over there?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.400
Oh, well.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.695
First day of camp.
You'll have to excuse the old girl.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.158
At least I'm not putting
salt in the sugar shakers.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.873
Well, I mean, you know...
sugar in the salt shakers.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.539
Now, where did she go?

10:00.683 --> 10:02.049
Touché.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.176
Good job.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.396
All right, excellent, kids.

10:07.565 --> 10:12.606
The winner and still undefeated champ
from Napa, California, Miss Hallie Parker.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.823
Do we have any challengers?

10:18.284 --> 10:21.743
Oh, come on, ladies.
Let's not be damsels in distress here.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.743
- I'll take a whack at it.
- OK.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.579
We've got ourselves a challenger.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.871
Thanks.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.175
Here I go.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.717
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.386
Go, Annie.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.226
Fencers ready?

10:51.526 --> 10:52.892
Ready.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.310
All set.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.695
En garde. Fence.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.639
Touché!

11:27.353 --> 11:29.345
- Nice catch.
- Thanks.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.522
Touché.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.364
- Sorry. Let me help you.
- No, let me help you.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.954
- What'd you do that for?
- Me? You pushed me in.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.116
- I did not.
- OK.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.377
That was quite a show.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.289
All right. I think we've got ourselves
a new camp champ.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.794
From London, England,
Miss Annie James.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.961
All right, girls. Shake hands.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.049
Come on, girls.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.279
- They look alike.
- Look at them.

12:34.045 --> 12:37.129
- Why's everyone staring?
- Don't you see it?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.836
- See what?
- The resemblance between us.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.752
Resemblance?
Between you and me?

12:44.138 --> 12:46.050
Let me see. Turn sideways.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.600
Now the other way.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.599
Well, your eyes are much
closer together than mine.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.860
Your ears... well, don't worry,
you'll grow into them.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.942
Your teeth are a little crooked.

13:03.408 --> 13:07.118
Oh, and that nose. Well, don't worry,
dear. Those things can be fixed.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.827
- Want me to deck her for you?
- Hold on. I'm not quite finished yet.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.162
You want to know
the real difference between us?

13:14.335 --> 13:18.295
Let me see.
I know how to fence and you don't?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.421
Or I have class and you don't?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.708
- Take your pick.
- Why, I oughta...

13:22.885 --> 13:26.049
Ladies, it's time to break up
this little lovefest.

13:26.222 --> 13:31.388
Annie, Hallie. I mean, Hallie, Annie...
I mean, whoa.

13:41.237 --> 13:45.026
Sorry, ladies. Two pair.
Read 'em and weep.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.940
I'm out.

13:47.118 --> 13:50.907
- So that's it? No more takers?
- I've nothing left.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.572
I'll take a whack at it.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.961
Take a seat, Parker.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.302
Deal me in.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.648
<i>Well, on the day I was born</i>

14:19.817 --> 14:22.059
<i>The nurses all gathered 'round</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:24.440
<i>And they gazed in wide wonder</i>

14:24.822 --> 14:26.939
<i>At the joy they had found</i>

14:27.283 --> 14:29.149
<i>The head nurse spoke up</i>

14:29.410 --> 14:31.652
<i>Said leave this one alone</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:34.158
<i>She could tell right away</i>

14:34.499 --> 14:36.582
<i>That I was bad to the bone</i>

14:36.751 --> 14:38.492
<i>Bad to the bone</i>

14:42.965 --> 14:46.174
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll make you a little deal.

14:46.719 --> 14:51.054
- Loser jumps into the lake after the game.
- Excellent.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.965
Butt naked.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.888
Even more excellent.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.558
Start unzipping, Parker.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.562
Straight in diamonds.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.818
You're good, James.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.610
But... you're just not good enough.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.528
In your honor, a royal flush.

15:16.124 --> 15:19.037
- Love the birthday suit.
- Looking good!

15:35.101 --> 15:36.637
Grab her clothes.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.019
Right. Fine.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.815
If that's the way you want it,
then let the games begin.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.365
I swear I heard
your evil clone sneezing

15:55.538 --> 15:58.246
all the way
across the mess hall this morning.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.956
I am so tired. I am going back into bed
and sleeping till lunch.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.044
That does not seem
like a possibility, babe.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.925
- Why not?
- That's why not.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.639
No way.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.477
Sh.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.105
Oh, I hope they're sleeping.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.242
The coast is clear. OK, come on.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.415
Payback time. Don't wake her up.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.920
Careful.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.173
Got milk?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.552
Ugh!

17:42.436 --> 17:45.395
Ew. Ew. Eew...

17:45.565 --> 17:48.023
Oh, my God.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.322
She didn't get me.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.169
Whoaaa!

18:13.968 --> 18:16.961
That girl is without a doubt

18:17.138 --> 18:20.506
the lowest, most awful creature
that ever walked the planet.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.266
Thank you, thank you very much.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.306
- Morning, girls.
- Morning, Marvas.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.391
Marvas?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.688
Surprise inspection. Attention.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.525
Navajos.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.780
No, no, Marva. Do not go in there.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.289
One of the girls got sick last night
and it is a big, big mess.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.955
Save yourself the aggravation,
it's really disgusting.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.591
Oh, well, if someone's sick, dear,
then I must go in.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.720
Move aside, dear.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.634
No, really, I insist.
I can't let you go in there.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.762
She's highly contagious. Honest.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.478
Actually, we're all quite fine in here,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.815
unless Hallie Parker
knows something we don't know.

19:15.905 --> 19:20.070
Really, I insist. Open the door
and come see for yourself, ma'am.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.574
Stand aside, Hallie.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.338
No!

19:51.607 --> 19:53.769
I told you it was a mess in here.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.271
She should know, she did it.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.772
You and you...

20:00.491 --> 20:02.483
pack your bags!

20:24.557 --> 20:29.393
OK, girls. The rest of you,
back to your activities.

20:32.064 --> 20:36.775
You two... the isolation cabin.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.712
Oh.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.296
Oh, gosh, it's stuck.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.473
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.693
Oh, man.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.536
Oh, here's your...

22:17.419 --> 22:18.751
Cuppy.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.836
- Any of your pictures ruined?
- Only the beautiful Leo DiCaprio.

22:28.222 --> 22:31.465
- Who?
- You've never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.554
How far away is London, anyway?

22:33.727 --> 22:39.018
Well, from here it's 3,000 miles,
but sometimes it seems much further.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.062
How far away is your home?

22:41.235 --> 22:44.399
California's way at the other end
of the country.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.985
Actually, here's a picture of my house.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.945
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Yeah. We built it when I was little.

22:53.122 --> 22:57.742
We've got this incredible porch that
looks over the entire vineyard and then...

22:57.918 --> 23:00.786
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my dad.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.922
He didn't know I was taking the picture
then or else he'd have turned around.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.880
He's kind of like my best friend.
We do everything together.

23:12.016 --> 23:15.851
- What's the matter?
- It's chilly in here, that's all.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.943
- Want one?
- Oh, sure. I love Oreos.

23:25.112 --> 23:28.605
At home I eat them with peanut butter.

23:29.325 --> 23:33.069
You do? That is so weird. So do I.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.613
You're kidding?
Most people find that totally disgusting.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.828
- I know. I don't get it.
- Me either.

23:44.506 --> 23:48.341
What's your dad like? I mean,
is he the kind of father you can talk to

23:48.510 --> 23:50.877
or is he one of those
workaholic types who says,

23:51.096 --> 23:54.840
"I'll talk to you later, honey," but,
you know, never really does? I hate that.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.679
I don't have a father, actually.

23:56.852 --> 24:02.189
I mean, I had one once, I suppose,
but my parents divorced years ago.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.395
My mother never even mentions him.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.686
It's like he evaporated
into thin air or something.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.822
It's scary the way
nobody stays together anymore.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.198
Tell me about it.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.994
- How old are you?
- I'll be 12 on October 11.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.532
- So will I.
- Your birthday's on October 11?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.951
- Yeah.
- How weird is that?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.619
Extremely.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.755
Oh, hey, it's stopped raining.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.796
Want to go get a Popsicle or something?

24:39.228 --> 24:42.812
- What's the matter?
- Hallie, what's your mother like?

24:43.649 --> 24:48.144
I never met her. She and my dad split up
when I was a baby. Maybe even before.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.979
I'm not sure.
He doesn't like to talk about her.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.864
But I know
she was really, really beautiful.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.485
How do you know that?

24:56.704 --> 25:00.368
Well, because my dad had this old picture
of her hidden in his sock drawer.

25:00.541 --> 25:04.535
He caught me looking at it, like,
all the time so he gave it to me to keep.

25:04.712 --> 25:05.828
Look, I'm really thirsty.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.584
Sure you don't want to go to the mess hall
and get a lemonade or something?

25:08.966 --> 25:12.050
Will you stop thinking
about your stomach at a time like this?

25:12.219 --> 25:15.007
- At a time like what?
- Don't you realize what's happening?

25:16.724 --> 25:18.966
I mean, think about it.

25:19.143 --> 25:22.932
I only have a mother
and you only have a father.

25:23.105 --> 25:27.099
You've never seen your mum
and I've never seen my dad.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.518
You have one old picture of your mum

25:29.695 --> 25:32.278
and I have one old picture of my dad.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.940
But at least yours
is probably a whole picture,

25:35.117 --> 25:37.325
mine's a pathetic
little thing all crinkled

25:37.494 --> 25:40.032
all crinkled and ripped
right down the middle and...

25:40.622 --> 25:42.830
What are you rummaging
in your trunk for?

25:44.293 --> 25:47.957
This. It's the picture of my mom.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.871
And it's ripped too.

25:50.591 --> 25:54.426
- Right down the middle?
- Right down the middle.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.147
This is so freaky.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.366
OK.

26:18.786 --> 26:21.950
On the count of three,
we'll show them to each other, OK?

26:22.706 --> 26:23.787
OK.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.824
One.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.459
Two.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.871
Three.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.347
- That's my dad.
- That's my mum.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.809
That's the lunch bell.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.475
I'm not so hungry anymore.

26:50.359 --> 26:54.319
So, if your mom is my mom

26:55.364 --> 26:57.947
and my dad is your dad,

26:58.867 --> 27:02.156
and we were both born on October 11,

27:02.830 --> 27:05.948
then you and I are, like, sisters.

27:06.792 --> 27:11.082
Sisters? Hallie, we're, like, twins.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.138
I just don't know what to say.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.972
- What's that you're holding?
- My locket. I got it when I was born.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.638
It has an <i>H</i> on it.

27:31.024 --> 27:35.109
I got mine when I was born too,
except mine has an <i>A</i> on it.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.151
Now I've got goose bumps.

27:40.033 --> 27:43.526
My God, so I'm not an only child,
I'm a twin.

27:43.829 --> 27:47.038
I'm a twin. There's two of me,
I mean, two of us.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.745
- This is, like...
- Mind-boggling.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.251
- Totally.
- Completely.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.959
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

28:01.972 --> 28:04.305
Tell me, what's Mom like?

28:04.725 --> 28:08.014
Well, she designs wedding gowns.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.178
Really?

28:10.856 --> 28:13.223
She's becoming quite famous, actually.

28:13.609 --> 28:16.226
A princess in Greece
just bought one of her gowns.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.856
Wow.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.734
You know what's interesting?

28:21.491 --> 28:24.655
Neither one of our parents
ever got married again.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.279
Has Dad ever been close
to getting remarried?

28:27.497 --> 28:31.036
Never. He always says
I'm the only girl in his life.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.203
Yeah. Mum's never come close either.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.258
I have a brilliant,
beyond brilliant, idea.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.798
I'm serious, I am a total genius.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.559
- You want to know what Dad is like, right?
- Right.

28:50.729 --> 28:56.145
And I'm dying to know Mom, so what
I'm thinking is... Don't freak out, OK?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.897
I think we should switch places.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.939
When camp's over,
I'll go back to London as you

29:02.115 --> 29:04.949
- and you go back to California as me.
- What?

29:05.118 --> 29:07.826
Annie, we can pull it off.
We're twins, aren't we?

29:07.996 --> 29:11.990
Hallie, we're totally and completely,
100 percent different.

29:12.167 --> 29:16.787
So? What's the problem? I'll teach you
to be me and you teach me to be you.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.705
Look, I can do you already.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.045
Yes. You want
to know the difference between us?

29:22.219 --> 29:24.302
I have class and you don't.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.006
Come on, Annie. I gotta meet my ma.

29:28.433 --> 29:32.177
The truth is, you know, if we switch,

29:32.688 --> 29:36.102
sooner or later
they'll have to unswitch us.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.859
And when they do they'll have
to meet again, face-to-face.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.815
After all these years.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.023
Thank you. I told you I'm brilliant.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.444
OK. This is Grandfather.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.038
He's so cute. What do we call him?

29:52.457 --> 29:55.074
- Grandfather.
- Why didn't I think of that?

29:55.752 --> 29:57.664
This is Martin. He's our butler.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.421
- We have a butler?
- Mm-hm.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.754
OK. Living room's first,
then over here is the dining room.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.965
But we never eat in there
except for Thanksgiving and Christmas

30:07.139 --> 30:08.675
and, of course, October 11.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.597
<i>Talkin' 'bout magic</i>

30:17.774 --> 30:21.063
<i>Do you believe in magic</i>

30:21.486 --> 30:23.648
<i>Do you believe, believe</i>

30:24.865 --> 30:27.073
<i>Do you believe in magic</i>

30:29.911 --> 30:31.152
OK.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.029
I'm ready.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.933
- Don't shut <i>your</i> eyes.
- Oh. OK. Right.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.063
Sorry. Just got a little nervous.

31:00.233 --> 31:03.271
You're nervous?
An 11-year-old is cutting my hair.

31:03.695 --> 31:07.109
- Hey, you sounded just like me.
- Well, I'm supposed to, aren't I?

31:07.657 --> 31:09.319
Go on, just do it.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.614
Don't panic. You look great.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.629
Looking good.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.804
This is so scary.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.014
Honey, you never looked better.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.309
Oh, my God.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.684
What?

31:45.445 --> 31:47.311
I have pierced ears.

31:47.864 --> 31:51.198
No. No, no and no. Not happening.

31:51.368 --> 31:56.580
- Sorry, wrong number. I won't. I refuse.
- Then cutting your hair was a total waste

31:56.665 --> 31:59.123
'cause, I mean, there's no way
I can go to camp with pierced ears

31:59.209 --> 32:02.418
and come home without them.
I mean, come on. Get real.

32:18.687 --> 32:22.772
- Needle sterilized.
- You sure you know what you're doing?

32:22.899 --> 32:27.644
Relax. I've gone with all my friends
to get their ears pierced. It's nothing.

32:27.821 --> 32:31.656
Just close your eyes
and it'll be over before you know it.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.196
- Earring ready?
- Yes.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.985
Good. Hand me the apple.

32:39.499 --> 32:44.335
Thank you. Just relax.
I'm telling you, this is not a big deal.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.292
On the count of three, remove the ice.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.628
One. Two.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.676
Three.

33:07.569 --> 33:11.609
Girls, time to say your last goodbyes.
The buses are loading.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.820
I'll see you guys next summer. I promise.

33:16.953 --> 33:21.072
- OK. So call me every single day.
- All right, and write me. Don't forget.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.743
OK. This is it.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.913
So remember, you're going
to find out how Mum and Dad met.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.169
And you're going to find out
why they broke up.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.050
Annie James, your car is here.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.712
That's you.
Here's your ticket and passport.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.843
Martin will pick you up at the airport
tomorrow morning.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.633
- What time do you leave?
- Oh, not for a couple of hours.

33:40.810 --> 33:43.769
- Give Mum a kiss for me.
- And give Dad one for me.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.771
Annie James. Front and center.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.227
Bye.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.393
Last call, Annie James.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.191
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.200
Good luck.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.842
OK. This is it.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.895
God, I hope she likes me.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.810
Please like me.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.350
Please.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.927
- Annie!
- Martin!

35:10.233 --> 35:12.350
- Missed you.
- Missed you.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.395
- What have you done to your hair?
- Cut it. Do you like it?

35:16.156 --> 35:18.443
Love it. It's the new you.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.950
And you've had your ears pierced.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.152
Give me five, girlfriend.

35:39.054 --> 35:43.094
<i>There she goes</i>

35:43.475 --> 35:46.388
<i>There she goes again</i>

35:47.270 --> 35:50.104
<i>Racing through my brain</i>

35:50.899 --> 35:53.892
<i>And I just can't contain</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:58.943
<i>This feeling that remains</i>

36:08.750 --> 36:12.084
<i>There she goes</i>

36:12.712 --> 36:15.204
<i>There she goes again</i>

36:15.507 --> 36:18.045
<i>She calls my name</i>

36:55.922 --> 36:58.460
- Home again.
- Thank you.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.969
This is it. 7 Pembroke Lane.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.832
Hello?

38:04.657 --> 38:05.898
Grandfather?

38:09.537 --> 38:12.405
- I'm home.
- Is that my little girl?

38:12.874 --> 38:15.491
That tall gangly thing?

38:15.668 --> 38:19.207
- Yes. It's me.
- Oh.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.288
Welcome home.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.002
- Did you have a good time, sweet pea?
- Uh-huh. Great.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.386
What are you doing?

38:27.931 --> 38:29.888
- Just smelling.
- Smelling?

38:30.058 --> 38:32.050
- I'm making a memory.
- Oh.

38:32.227 --> 38:36.688
Years from now, when I'm all grown-up,
I'll always remember my grandfather

38:36.940 --> 38:41.651
and how he always smelt of...
peppermint and pipe tobacco.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.066
- Good to have you back.
- Annie?

38:49.911 --> 38:51.027
Annie?

38:53.915 --> 38:56.077
- Mother.
- You're back!

39:12.976 --> 39:16.344
- I can't believe it's you.
- And I can't believe it's you.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.934
And with short hair. Who cut it for you?

39:20.108 --> 39:23.021
A girl I met at camp. Do you hate it?

39:23.194 --> 39:25.857
No, I absolutely love it.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.022
You got your ears pierced?

39:30.118 --> 39:33.828
Well, are there any other surprises?
Bellybutton rings? Tattoos?

39:34.831 --> 39:36.663
Oh, darling, what is it?

39:37.458 --> 39:42.294
I'm sorry. It's just
I've missed you so much.

39:45.133 --> 39:48.752
I know. It seems like it's been forever.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.714
You have no idea.

39:57.687 --> 40:01.351
So, come on, tell me.
Did you like everyone? Was it fun?

40:01.524 --> 40:02.640
Ah, Martin.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.901
I found a stowaway in your suitcase.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.562
- Oh, my God, Cuppy.
- Cuppy?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.654
He belongs to my friend.
The one I was telling you about.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.285
I can't imagine
how he got into my suitcase.

40:15.455 --> 40:18.994
Well, since he's not our Cuppy,
shall we dispose of the little creature?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.453
No!

40:20.793 --> 40:24.036
I mean, no. I'll mail him to her.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.630
She loves this thing a lot. A lot, a lot.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.667
She's, like, slept with this thing
her entire life

40:29.844 --> 40:33.087
and she could never be, like,
say, in a foreign country without him.

40:33.264 --> 40:37.178
No, no. I'll take care of it.
That will be all, Martin. Thank you.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.262
Hello?

40:41.981 --> 40:44.644
Oh, hi. How's the photo shoot going?

40:50.865 --> 40:54.905
Well, can't you manage without me?
I mean, Annie just got home from camp.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.089
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

41:10.718 --> 41:12.050
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

41:12.220 --> 41:16.089
<i>And I say it's all right</i>

41:19.852 --> 41:21.593
<i>Little darling...</i>

41:22.647 --> 41:24.388
OK. Hold on a moment.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.730
Annie, would you hate very much
running down to the studio with me?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.690
No, I'd love it.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.784
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

41:38.496 --> 41:40.408
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

41:40.665 --> 41:43.578
<i>I say it's all right</i>

41:51.509 --> 41:52.875
<i>Little darling</i>

41:53.094 --> 41:58.306
<i>The smile's returning to their faces</i>

41:58.975 --> 42:00.432
<i>Little darling</i>

42:00.643 --> 42:05.308
<i>It seems like years since it's been here</i>

42:06.482 --> 42:07.939
<i>Here comes the sun</i>

42:09.777 --> 42:10.767
Wow.

42:10.945 --> 42:14.234
That's incredible. You designed that?

42:14.449 --> 42:16.862
I had to do something
while you were at camp.

42:17.035 --> 42:20.745
- You don't think it's too...?
- No, it's gorgeous. I love it.

42:21.497 --> 42:24.114
You know who would look
really beautiful in that gown?

42:24.333 --> 42:25.915
I mean, like, really beautiful.

42:26.085 --> 42:27.667
- Who?
- You.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.793
Me? You know what, I think that
time change has made you a little loopy.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.333
Come on.
Let's see what all the fuss is about.

42:35.261 --> 42:38.095
- OK. I'm here.
- Ah, we're saved.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.630
- Hi, Vendela.
- Hi.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.594
Sorry, we don't know
what to do with the veil.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.805
If she wears it
it covers the back of the dress

42:43.978 --> 42:46.436
- and if she doesn't, the dress looks...
- Incomplete. You're right.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.060
Can you try turning sideways
with your chin up?

42:49.233 --> 42:52.317
Yeah. I see the problem.
Can I have the veil? Annie, darling?

42:52.487 --> 42:55.821
Pass me one of those hats
on display in the window.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.731
- Me?
- Yes.

43:02.872 --> 43:05.455
- Which one do you like?
- The white one.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.366
Me too.

43:08.169 --> 43:12.539
Try this.
Now throw the veil straight back.

43:12.757 --> 43:16.000
That's it. Now spin around,
I want to see the back of the dress.

43:16.177 --> 43:19.170
That's beautiful. Did you get that?
Just how it falls just down there.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.634
Don't worry about the bouquet.
You're married now,

43:21.808 --> 43:24.516
you've got to learn to juggle.
Don't forget to look happy.

43:24.685 --> 43:25.892
It is your wedding day.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.519
My mom is too cool.

43:33.111 --> 43:36.479
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

43:36.697 --> 43:38.438
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

43:47.500 --> 43:50.243
<i>Never let you go</i>

43:51.629 --> 43:53.086
<i>I'll never let you go</i>

43:54.549 --> 43:56.836
So, doesn't designing
all these wedding gowns

43:57.009 --> 43:58.921
ever make you think
about getting married again,

43:59.095 --> 44:01.462
or at least make you think
about the F-word?

44:01.639 --> 44:04.302
- The F-word?
- My father.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.677
Oh, that F-word. Well, no, actually,

44:07.854 --> 44:12.064
because I didn't even wear a wedding
gown when I married the F-word.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.225
You didn't? Why not?

44:14.402 --> 44:17.065
Why the sudden curiosity
about your dad, huh?

44:17.238 --> 44:19.400
Well, maybe because
he's never mentioned,

44:19.574 --> 44:21.406
and you can't blame a kid for wondering.

44:21.576 --> 44:23.283
Mother, you can't avoid
the subject forever.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.409
At least tell me what he was like.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.744
OK. He was quite lovely,
to tell you the truth.

44:28.916 --> 44:32.409
When we met
he was actually entirely lovely.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.078
- All right?
- All right.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.247
So did you meet him here in London?

44:36.424 --> 44:38.757
- We met on the <i>QE2.</i>
- QE what?

44:38.926 --> 44:42.966
The <i>Queen Elizabeth 2</i>. It's an ocean liner
that sails from London to New York.

44:43.139 --> 44:45.973
'Cause I wasn't keen on flying then
and neither was your father.

44:46.142 --> 44:50.102
We met our first night on board ship. We
were seated next to each other at dinner.

44:50.271 --> 44:52.263
- He's an American, you know.
- No kidding?

44:52.440 --> 44:54.807
So, was it love at first sight?

44:55.943 --> 44:59.607
I knew you were going to ask me
all these questions one day. Taxi!

45:01.073 --> 45:06.114
<i>Dear old Dad. I wonder
what he's doing at this very moment.</i>

45:16.130 --> 45:17.371
Thanks.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.461
Oh, gosh. It's him.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.463
Hey, Hal!

45:28.184 --> 45:29.720
Welcome home, kiddo.

45:34.607 --> 45:37.896
- Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad.

45:38.569 --> 45:39.810
Finally.

45:46.035 --> 45:49.654
Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.446
I missed you too much.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.746
What happened to you, Hal?

45:55.378 --> 45:57.165
Something's changed.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.413
Are you getting taller?

46:01.759 --> 46:03.842
So, what's up, Dad?

46:04.011 --> 46:06.173
I mean, how's Chessy and everybody?

46:06.347 --> 46:09.306
Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you.

46:09.934 --> 46:13.553
Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.971
A lot's happened to me too, Dad.

46:16.148 --> 46:19.391
I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman.

46:21.237 --> 46:23.354
What's the matter? I cut myself shaving?

46:23.531 --> 46:27.775
No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time.

46:27.952 --> 46:30.990
I mean, you know... in so long.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.955
You look taller to me too, Dad.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.037
Come on, squirt. Let's get home.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.767
<i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.</i>

46:53.936 --> 46:56.644
I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery

46:56.814 --> 46:58.305
you just had to have.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.395
- We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- "We?"

47:01.569 --> 47:05.859
Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close.

47:06.032 --> 47:07.068
Great.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.815
Practically like sisters.

47:09.910 --> 47:12.243
- She was a lovely girl.
- "Lovely girl?"

47:13.122 --> 47:15.205
What, all of a sudden you're so proper?

47:16.292 --> 47:19.501
- Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed!

47:19.670 --> 47:23.254
What do you mean, "noticed?" You've
been biting them since you could chew.

47:23.424 --> 47:26.417
But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.547
"Lovely girl," "horrid habit."

47:28.721 --> 47:31.759
What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school?

47:31.932 --> 47:34.766
And why do you keep saying "Dad"
at the end of every sentence?

47:34.935 --> 47:37.928
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.639
Sorry, Dad.

47:42.276 --> 47:46.065
Do you want to know
why I keep saying "Dad?" The truth?

47:46.238 --> 47:48.946
'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right?

47:49.909 --> 47:51.116
Exactly.

47:51.285 --> 47:56.451
It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks -

47:56.624 --> 48:00.743
I was never able to say the word "Dad."
Never. Not once.

48:01.921 --> 48:03.082
And if you ask me,

48:03.255 --> 48:06.214
a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life.

48:06.634 --> 48:10.548
Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers.

48:10.721 --> 48:13.384
Just imagine someone's life
without a father.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.549
Never buying a Father's Day card.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.718
Never sitting on their father's lap.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.477
Never being able to say, "Hi, Dad!"

48:19.647 --> 48:22.606
or, "What's up, Dad?"
or, "Catch you later, Dad."

48:22.775 --> 48:25.643
I mean, a baby's first words
are always "Dada," aren't they?

48:25.820 --> 48:30.064
Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to call me "Dad?"

48:30.241 --> 48:33.325
Yeah. I really have, Dad.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

48:43.337 --> 48:45.875
Now you're starting
to sound like your old self.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.690
Hello, gorgeous!

49:12.867 --> 49:15.029
Oh, look at you!

49:15.202 --> 49:17.364
Oh, you grew.

49:17.538 --> 49:21.373
Oh, we missed you so much.

49:21.584 --> 49:25.077
Hey. Don't you dare let your old man
talk you out of going back to camp, OK?

49:25.171 --> 49:26.707
You're a growing girl. You need adventure.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.165
- OK.
- You hungry?

49:30.176 --> 49:31.883
I made corn bread and chili.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.510
- Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.637
It's just I'm so happy to be home.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.720
Hey, did I hear something
about corn bread and chili?

49:39.810 --> 49:42.393
Yeah, it's on the stove. So...

49:43.063 --> 49:47.103
Something's changed about you, Hal.
Hm. I can't put my finger on it,

49:47.276 --> 49:49.984
but something about you
has definitely changed.

49:50.154 --> 49:53.989
Really? Well, it's just the same old me.

49:55.075 --> 49:57.112
Honest.

49:59.371 --> 50:00.737
Hi, Sammy!

50:03.501 --> 50:06.209
What is wrong with you, you goofball?
It's Hallie.

50:06.378 --> 50:09.496
Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all.

50:11.634 --> 50:14.798
What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even recognize her.

50:20.267 --> 50:23.055
Wow, it's even better than the pictures.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.811
OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do first, huh?

50:28.984 --> 50:34.025
You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat.

50:34.198 --> 50:36.986
Or we could eat while we unpack.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.242
You mean I can eat in my room?

50:39.828 --> 50:42.320
Yeah, it's a definite possibility.

50:42.498 --> 50:46.037
Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on
down. There's someone I want you to meet.

50:46.293 --> 50:48.956
- OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal.

50:52.925 --> 50:55.417
Look at you, always eating.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.800
- Did you tell her?
- No.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.260
Oh, Nicky.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.091
Tell me what?

51:04.436 --> 51:08.430
Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK?

51:08.607 --> 51:13.193
- He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she?

51:15.447 --> 51:19.817
Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.986
Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer

51:22.162 --> 51:24.028
to do some publicity for the vineyard.

51:24.206 --> 51:28.246
If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes.

51:28.419 --> 51:31.628
What do you mean?

51:33.173 --> 51:36.507
Look, you and I both know your father's
not some kind of suave, debonair,

51:36.677 --> 51:38.009
bachelor-of-the-month type.

51:38.178 --> 51:41.637
So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing like that

51:41.807 --> 51:44.515
see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out

51:44.685 --> 51:46.176
and a cereal bowl full of chili.

51:46.937 --> 51:51.147
Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.978
All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.654
You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him?

51:58.824 --> 52:00.907
Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing,

52:01.076 --> 52:03.568
this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand.

52:03.787 --> 52:07.497
They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together.

52:07.666 --> 52:09.658
They go out to eat dinner every night.

52:09.835 --> 52:14.000
Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.

52:15.007 --> 52:20.002
There's my girl. Honey,
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

52:20.387 --> 52:23.300
Hal, this is Meredith Blake.

52:27.603 --> 52:28.889
Hi.

52:31.023 --> 52:33.481
Hi... Meredith Blake.

52:33.859 --> 52:37.102
Wow, I can't believe
I'm finally meeting the famous Hallie.

52:37.863 --> 52:41.823
- I have looked forward to this all summer.
- Really? Well, here I am.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.530
Oh, Nicky, she's adorable.

52:44.703 --> 52:47.116
You know, the way
your father talked about you,

52:47.289 --> 52:50.248
I expected to meet a little girl,
but you are so grown-up.

52:50.501 --> 52:53.118
I'll be 12 soon. How old are you?

52:55.047 --> 52:56.037
Twenty-six.

52:56.215 --> 52:59.549
Only 15 years older than me.
How old are you again, Dad?

52:59.718 --> 53:02.756
Wow, suddenly you're so interested
in math. Look, I'm gonna go inside.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.799
I'm going to get some more chili,
maybe a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

53:06.975 --> 53:08.841
What are we celebrating?

53:09.645 --> 53:12.103
Your homecoming, of course.

53:12.272 --> 53:13.604
Be right back.

53:15.317 --> 53:16.683
Meredith Blake.

53:18.445 --> 53:20.562
Hello, Reverend Mosby.

53:21.240 --> 53:22.526
Mm-hm.

53:22.908 --> 53:25.446
Of course. No, I understand
it's for a local charity?

53:26.120 --> 53:28.783
Oh, yes, I am writing it all down.

53:30.165 --> 53:32.122
OK, it sounds very worthwhile, I agree,

53:32.376 --> 53:37.212
but unfortunately I see that Mr. Parker
will be out of the country on those days.

53:37.381 --> 53:40.670
Yes, absolutely.
I will be sure to mention it to him.

53:40.843 --> 53:42.050
Thank you.

53:42.678 --> 53:44.089
So...

53:44.263 --> 53:46.596
How was camp, Hal? Was it fabulous?

53:46.807 --> 53:50.676
- My dad's going out of the country?
- Oh. No.

53:50.853 --> 53:53.687
I just had to tell a little white lie
to get him out of something.

53:54.314 --> 53:57.682
You know, I have never heard
a man talk about his daughter

53:57.860 --> 53:59.852
the way that Nicky talks about you.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.612
You two are obviously incredibly close.

54:02.781 --> 54:06.320
Well, you know, we're closer than close.
We're all each other has.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.495
Sorry. Did I get you wet, Mer?

54:14.710 --> 54:17.418
Just a little, Hal.

54:20.466 --> 54:23.209
Hey, guess what.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.878
Your daddy took me riding the other day
and he let me ride your horse.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.134
I hope that's OK with you.

54:29.725 --> 54:33.810
Oh, sure. Sprout's used
to strange women riding her.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.263
Not that you're strange or anything.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.063
Actually, compared to the others
you're relatively normal.

54:40.194 --> 54:42.686
Others? What others?

54:42.988 --> 54:46.197
- You want the 411?
- What's the 411?

54:46.533 --> 54:50.777
The information, the lowdown
on other women. Can't say I blame you.

54:50.954 --> 54:54.447
I'd want to know if I was number 28-
I mean, 29- in a man's life.

54:54.625 --> 54:57.208
- I'm number 29?
- Yeah.

54:57.419 --> 55:01.254
It's always the same routine.
Horseback riding through the vineyards,

55:01.548 --> 55:06.168
romantic dinners with his special reserve
label wine. Moonlight swims.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.512
Here we go.
A bottle of my special reserve label.

55:10.933 --> 55:14.552
So, did you girls find something
to talk about while I was gone?

55:16.063 --> 55:18.771
- Does that mean yes?
- It sure does.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.651
Will somebody
grab that, please?

55:26.114 --> 55:29.698
- James residence. Annie?
- Yes, Martin?

55:29.868 --> 55:31.700
Oh, dear, it sounds just like you
on the phone.

55:31.870 --> 55:35.329
I'm sorry. To whom
did you wish to speak? Annie?

55:35.999 --> 55:38.241
Of course. One moment, please.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.708
A Mildred Plotka for you.
Sounds just like your twin.

55:43.423 --> 55:46.507
My twin? Very funny. Good one, Martin.

55:46.677 --> 55:50.717
Hello? Oh, Mildred, darling.
Hi, how are you?

55:50.889 --> 55:52.551
Hey. How's it going over there?

55:52.724 --> 55:56.388
<i>Oh, everything's quite lovely here.
We're expecting a bit of rain today,</i>

55:56.687 --> 55:58.849
but, Mildred, can you hold on
for a moment?

55:59.147 --> 56:01.890
OK, but hurry, Hal.
I've got to talk to you.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.196
OK. Now I can talk.
Oh, my God, Mom's incredible.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.234
I cannot believe I lived my entire life
without knowing her.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.073
She's beautiful and fun and smart

56:14.288 --> 56:16.575
<i>- and I love the gowns she designs.</i>
- But...

56:16.748 --> 56:19.331
And I got her talking
about how she and Dad first met

56:19.501 --> 56:21.914
- and if you ask me there's a whole...
<i>- Hallie!</i>

56:22.087 --> 56:24.124
Stop! We've got a major problem.

56:24.256 --> 56:26.669
You're going to have
to bring Mother out here immediately.

56:26.884 --> 56:29.592
Immediately? Are you nuts?
I've only had one day with her.

56:29.761 --> 56:32.094
I'm just getting to know her.
I can't. I won't.

56:32.723 --> 56:35.386
But this is an emergency. Dad's in love.

56:35.517 --> 56:39.852
Get out of here. Dad doesn't fall in love.
I mean, at least not seriously.

56:40.105 --> 56:42.347
Trust me, he's serious about this one.

56:42.482 --> 56:47.022
He's always holding her hand and kissing
her neck and waiting on her hand and foot.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.445
- He is?
- It's disgusting.

56:49.656 --> 56:52.569
You'll just have to break them up.
Sabotage it. Do whatever you have to.

56:52.784 --> 56:55.572
I'm trying, but, I mean,
I'm at a slight disadvantage.

56:55.787 --> 56:58.120
<i>I only met the man 12 hours ago.</i>

56:58.624 --> 57:00.957
<i>Hal, you've got to get back here
to help me.</i>

57:01.126 --> 57:03.914
Annie, I can't. I want more time with Mom.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.370
What's going on?

57:06.590 --> 57:08.752
Annie, are you still there?
I can barely hear you.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.542
- I'm here, what are you...?
<i>- Operator, operator.</i>

57:10.761 --> 57:12.844
- I think I lost you, Annie.
<i>- Hello?</i>

57:15.223 --> 57:17.010
Thanks for all the help, Hal.

57:19.519 --> 57:20.930
Ahem.

57:21.813 --> 57:24.772
Hi. I had a phone call
from a friend at camp.

57:24.942 --> 57:29.357
Yeah, it's an old camp tradition,
talk to your friend from inside a closet.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.316
Kind of stupid, I know, but...

57:33.492 --> 57:36.360
So, breakfast, anyone?

57:38.163 --> 57:41.577
OK. Here we go.
Most important meal of the day.

57:41.750 --> 57:44.333
Eggs, sunnyside up. Bacon, side of toast.

57:44.503 --> 57:48.247
And in case you're really hungry, a stack
of humongous chocolate chip pancakes,

57:48.423 --> 57:50.836
which smell incredible,
if I do say so myself.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.170
Thanks, Chessy.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.295
You're not hungry again?

57:55.889 --> 57:58.381
You hardly touched your chili,
your favorite food in the world,

57:58.558 --> 58:00.845
and now you don't want your breakfast?
Are you sick, honey?

58:01.019 --> 58:03.727
I'm fine, I promise. Where's Dad?

58:04.147 --> 58:07.390
Oh, he and Miss
I'll-just-have-half-a-grapefruit-thank-you

58:07.567 --> 58:11.356
left about an hour ago. You overslept
and he didn't want to wake you.

58:12.239 --> 58:13.605
Of course I'd probably oversleep too

58:13.782 --> 58:17.446
if I were up until midnight making
mysterious phone calls from my bathroom.

58:18.453 --> 58:21.821
Oh. Oh, that? I was calling
a friend from camp. Mildred.

58:21.999 --> 58:25.959
- She lives in New York.
- Oh, I see.

58:26.211 --> 58:29.295
So you wanted to wait and call Mildred
at a time that was convenient for her

58:29.464 --> 58:32.753
- because of the time difference?
- Exactly. Because of the time difference.

58:32.926 --> 58:37.216
Uh-huh? So you waited until it was
three in the morning her time?

58:37.389 --> 58:39.005
That makes perfect sense.

58:39.266 --> 58:44.682
Actually... it was seven at night
her time. You see, she lives in New York,

58:44.855 --> 58:47.563
but she was on vacation
with her family in Bora Bora.

58:50.777 --> 58:53.485
- Mm-hm.
- Very smooth.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.279
OK, look, smarty-pants, your father
wants you to meet him at his office

58:58.368 --> 59:01.281
- as soon as you're done with breakfast.
- He does? Thanks.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.238
I'm done.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.247
Whoa!

59:08.378 --> 59:10.916
That dog has gotten so weird.

59:11.089 --> 59:14.048
Bye, Chessy. Thanks again
for breakfast. It was great.

59:16.428 --> 59:17.839
Push, Hal.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.093
Sorry. I... forgot.

59:28.231 --> 59:31.565
Honey, I'm really glad you're here.
'Cause there's something

59:31.693 --> 59:33.685
really important
I want to talk to you about.

59:33.862 --> 59:36.195
That's funny because there's
something really important

59:36.364 --> 59:37.855
I want to talk to <i>you</i> about.

59:38.033 --> 59:40.241
- Yeah? Well, you go first.
- No, you.

59:40.744 --> 59:44.988
OK. I want to talk to you about Meredith.

59:45.207 --> 59:49.827
And I want to talk to you about my mother.
What about Meredith?

59:50.337 --> 59:53.580
- Well, what about your mother?
- Dad, I'm almost 12.

59:53.757 --> 59:55.623
How long do you expect me
to buy that story

59:55.801 --> 59:57.758
that the stork dropped me
on your doorstep?

59:57.928 --> 01:00:00.921
Oh, come on, Hal.
We've talked about your mother.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.930
No, we haven't. Not really.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.810
A girl needs more in life
than half a crumpled old photograph.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.938
Dad, I'm almost a teenager.
Face it, I need a mother.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:14.647
You know what. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.733
You do need a mother,
which brings me to...

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.070
- Meredith?
- Hi.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.827
- Hello, Hal.
- Hi.

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:28.289
Hallie, this is my assistant Richard.
Richard, this is Nick's daughter.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.495
The one I've been telling you
so much about.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.036
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hi, there.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.542
- Did you tell her?
- Almost.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.254
Hey, if you're free later, why don't
we all have lunch on the terrace?

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.465
Well, actually, I promised Hal
we'd hang out together this afternoon.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:46.098
Oh, no problem. I've got plenty to do.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:51.514
I'm working on a new label design, Nicky,
featuring y-o-u. You're going to love it.

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.979
- See you for dinner, darling. Bye, Hal.
- Bye.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:58.941
First change I make
is to send that two-faced little brat

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:01.106
off to boarding school in Timbuktu.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:04.697
- Ooh. Ice woman.
- Proud of it, babe.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.169
Come on, Dad.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:23.131
OK, OK. You win. Hold up.
Give that horse a rest.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.887
Whoa, Sprout.

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.926
So, honey, you excited
about our camping trip?

01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:31.518
What camping trip?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:35.807
What camping trip? The one we take every
summer before you go back to school.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:38.192
Oh, that camping trip.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.569
Yeah, sure. I can't wait.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.197
So, Hal...

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.407
- What do you think of Meredith?
- As what, Dad?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:52.373
Your publicist? Your friend?

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:55.873
No, just what do you think of her,
as a person?

01:01:56.421 --> 01:02:00.756
Well, she's cute.
She has nice hair, good teeth.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.963
She can spell the word "you."

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:06.129
Honestly, Dad?
The woman's a complete stranger to me.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.218
Why do you want my opinion anyway?

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:11.429
I'll tell you why, Hal.
Because, believe it or not...

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.310
Race you back to the ranch, Dad!

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.271
Hal!

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:18.183
Hal, I'm trying to tell you something.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:24.689
Hey! Slow down.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.515
I'm in so over my head here.
I can't handle this, I just can't.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.346
I'm only one kid.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.057
You got something you want
to share with the class there, Hal?

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.934
Chessy, you gave me a fright.

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:01.604
I gave you a fright?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:05.237
You scared me.
I didn't know you were, like, in here.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:09.408
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want to talk to me about?

01:03:11.663 --> 01:03:15.407
Like why Sammy
never comes near you anymore.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.997
Or why your appetite's changed.

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.797
Or why all of a sudden
you're neat as a pin

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:26.505
and using expressions like,
"You gave me a fright."

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:31.680
Chessy, I changed a lot
over the summer, that's all.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.340
OK.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.137
Boy, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say it's almost like you were...

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.687
Forget it. It's impossible.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.319
Almost as if I were who, Chessy?

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:48.071
Nobody. Nobody. Forget I mentioned it.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.733
Almost as if I were... Annie?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:04.755
- You know about Annie?
- I am Annie.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.084
Hal.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.130
Hal, why did you take off on me like that?

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:15.141
I told you I wanted
to talk to you about something.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:20.263
Chessy, why are you
looking at her like that?

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:23.641
Like what?
I'm not looking at her any special way.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:26.561
I'm looking at her
like I've looked at her for 11 years.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.735
Since the day
she came home from the hospital.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:34.698
Six pounds, 11 ounces. 21 inches long.
This is how I look at her.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.613
Can I hug her?

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.876
Oh, she's so beautiful.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.792
And so big.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:50.961
I'm going to make you something special
to eat. What would you like? Anything?

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.503
You know what, it doesn't matter.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.297
I'm just gonna go whip up
everything we've got. OK?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.266
Hal, come here.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.604
- We have to talk.
- OK. Shoot.

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:03.810
OK.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:06.309
Honey...

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:13.028
I want to know what you think
about making Meredith part of the family.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:16.820
- Part of <i>our</i> family?
- Yeah.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:20.285
- I think it's an awesome idea.
- Yeah?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.914
- Inspired! Brilliant!
- You do? Really? You do?

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:27.751
Totally. I mean, like it's a dream come
true. I've always wanted a big sister.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.123
Oh.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.924
Um... Honey, I think
you're kind of missing the point.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:37.473
No, I'm not.
You're going to adopt Meredith.

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:42.137
- That is so sweet, Dad.
- No, I am not going to adopt her.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:46.015
I'm... going to marry her.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.976
Marry her? That's insane.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:52.029
How can you marry a woman
young enough to be my big sister?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.111
<i>Mais tu plaisantes, j'espère.
Meredith, ce n'est pas une fille pour toi.</i>

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.447
<i>Mais c'est pas possible, je rêve.
Qu'est-ce qui...</i>

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.781
Calm down. Hal!

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.781
Are you speaking French?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.621
I learned it at camp.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.003
OK. I'm sorry.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.508
Let's discuss this calmly.
Calmly and rationally.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.589
Yeah, and in English, if you don't mind.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.303
- Right?
- OK.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.382
Sweetheart, what has gotten into you?

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:22.097
Nothing. Nothing. Just...

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:27.099
Dad, you can't get married.
It'll totally ruin completely everything.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.142
Hal. Hal.

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:31.731
Hallie.

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:35.610
Don't look at me. I don't know a thing.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.000
She thought I was going to adopt her?

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:57.962
- Hi, doll.
- Hi.

01:06:58.139 --> 01:07:00.973
Oh. You look stressed, baby.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:07.021
- How about a martini?
- How about a double?

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.106
Coming right up.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.275
Chessy!

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:18.275
Don't you love it? It's just what we need,
it's such a big house. Chessy!

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:25.452
- You rang?
- Two martinis, please.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.457
And make Mr. Parker's a double.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:33.293
Chess, please. I'm getting a migraine.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:40.092
- I told Hallie.
- You did? And?

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.803
She went ballistic.
She started yelling in French.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.929
I didn't even know she spoke French.

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.100
- I don't know what's gotten into her.
- Oh, Nicky.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.560
This reaction is totally classic.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:53.521
It's "Daddy's Getting Remarried 101."

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.736
I'd be worried if she didn't act this way.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.314
Look.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.905
Why don't I go talk to her?
You know, woman-to-woman.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:06.038
I think she's a little sensitive
about you right now.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:10.459
That's why I need to do it.
We've got to break the ice sometime.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.249
Wear your shirt like this. I like it
when I can see a little chest hair.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.062
Knock, knock. Can I join you?

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:35.475
Sure.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.283
Guess the news of the engagement
came as a bit of a shock, huh?

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.490
Basically.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.872
You know, I remember
what it was like to be 11.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.501
I had my first beau at 11.
It's a wonderful age.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.584
You're just starting to feel like a woman
and, believe it or not,

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.046
soon you'll understand
what it's like to be in love.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.176
Me? I don't think so.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.464
I don't even have
my 12-year-old molars yet.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:09.473
Well, take it from someone
who got their molars very early in life,

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:14.098
being in love is a fantastic mystery
that takes a man and a woman...

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:18.394
I don't mean to be jerky when you're
trying to be all mushy and everything,

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.654
but I know what mystery
my dad sees in you.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.401
You do?

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:26.613
You're young and beautiful and sexy
and, hey, the guy's only human.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:27.904
But if you ask me,

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:31.245
marriage is supposed to be based
on something more than just sex, right?

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.417
Boy, your father underestimates you.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.839
But you won't. Will you, Meredith?

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:42.796
Being young and beautiful's
not a crime, you know.

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.589
And for your 411, I adore your father.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:50.100
He's exactly the kind of man
I always planned on marrying.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:54.938
This is the real deal, honey. And nothing
you do is going to come between us.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.890
Hate to break it to you, angel,

01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:00.061
but you are no longer the only girl
in Nick Parker's life.

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:03.276
- Get over it.
- If this is the real deal,

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:08.285
then my dad's money has nothing to do
with you wanting to marry him, right?

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.993
OK, puss. You listen and you listen good.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.580
I am marrying your father in two weeks
whether you like it or not.

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:18.336
So I suggest
you do not tangle with me anymore.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:22.216
You are in way over your head.
Is that clear?

01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:25.218
Crystal.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:35.270
Martin! A refill, please.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.228
Lovely choice of wine, by the way, Martin.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:45.113
- Thank you, sir.
- May I have a sip?

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:48.199
I don't think you're going to like it.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:03.541
Well, if you ask me, the bouquet's
a little too robust for a Merlot,

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:07.462
but then again I'm partial
to the softer California grape.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.350
Has she learned about wine
at the summer camp?

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.101
She must have.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.570
- Darling! Are you all right?
- I had one sip too many, I guess.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:29.279
You know, Mother, I feel
like I could use a bit of fresh air.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.865
Would it be OK
if I stepped outside for a moment?

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.950
Are you OK?
Would you like me to go with you?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.454
No, no, no. I'll be fine.
Just got a touch woozy, that's all.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.041
Woozy, huh?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.021
I'd like to place
a collect call to America, please.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:12.700
- Hello?
- What's up?

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.204
Hal, I'm desperate. Dad's getting married.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.740
What do you mean, getting married?

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.751
I mean black tie, white gown,
the whole enchilada.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.162
- What?
<i>- The wedding's in two weeks.</i>

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:27.504
If there's any hope of getting Mum and Dad
back together we've got to do it fast.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.009
And I mean really fast.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.137
OK. So Mom and I are going out
to the theater tonight.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.969
I'll drop the bomb on her
first thing in the morning.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.553
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:40.346
- And, Hallie, hurry!
- OK. I will.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.974
Oh, excuse me, sir.

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:47.485
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. Yes.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.521
Now, what say you and I

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:52.157
take a little stroll
in the park, eh, young lady?

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:53.487
OK.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:56.112
Now...

01:12:56.914 --> 01:13:01.204
- Come on, what's this all about?
- Well, it's a long story.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.961
Well, it's a very big park
and we've got plenty of time, you know.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.747
Well, first of all...

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:11.089
<i>Féminine? Vraiment...
Je ne sais pas comment expliquer</i>

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:13.762
<i>mais vous aurez
le dessin demain, en tout cas.</i>

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.969
<i>En satin?
Non, non, ce sera quelque</i>

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.926
<i>chose plus moderne</i>

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:23.438
<i>avec de la dentelle, du tulle blanc
très, très jeune, très léger.</i>

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.023
Just do it, sweet pea.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:31.488
<i>Non, c'est trop, non. Oui, mademoiselle,
vous aurez le dessin demain matin.</i>

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:35.025
<i>Oui, tout à fait. Ne vous inquiétez pas.
Allez, au revoir.</i>

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:39.037
Darling, come in. I just have to finish
this sketch and fedex it off to Paris.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.289
Then how about you and I go out to lunch

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.623
and spend the rest of the day
getting lost in Harrods. Hm?

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:48.498
I can't, Mum, I'm sorry.
I have to go out of town today.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.666
Oh, you have to go out of town?

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.381
And where,
may I ask, are you going?

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.381
Annie. Annie.

01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:00.926
That's where
I have to go. I have to go see Annie.

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.265
I see. And where might Annie be?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:06.227
In Napa.
With her father Nick Parker.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.158
You're not Annie.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.528
That would be correct.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.247
You're Hallie?

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.076
I am.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:32.542
Annie and I met up at camp
and we decided to switch places.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:40.474
I'm sorry, but I'd never seen you,
and I dreamt of meeting you my whole life.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:45.980
Annie felt the exact same way about Dad,
so we sorta just switched lives.

01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:49.517
I hope you're not mad,
because I love you so much

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.937
and I just hope that one day
you can love me as me,

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.446
and not as Annie.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.608
Oh, darling.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.285
I've loved you your whole life.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:12.999
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.171
So, I...

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.931
I guess you have
to switch us back now, huh?

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:29.978
Well, technically, you belong to your dad
and Annie belongs to me.

01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:35.271
His and hers kids. No offense, Mom,
but this arrangement really sucks.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.906
I agree. It totally sucks.

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:42.661
Then I say we fly to Napa, see Annie
and Dad, and work this whole thing out.

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:47.666
And I say you're right. Not to worry,
darling. I'll take care of everything.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.918
You're not to worry, OK?

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:56.967
I'm sorry. I can't handle this.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:16:00.504
I mean, I haven't seen or heard
from Nick Parker in over 11 years,

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:03.515
and suddenly I'm flying
halfway across the world to...

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:07.519
I'm not mature enough for this.
If the man didn't make me so nuts,

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.939
I'd still be married to him.
I mean, we came up with this arrangement

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.521
so that we'd never
have to see each other again.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:16.528
I mean, look at me, Martin.
Have you ever seen me like this?

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.734
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.491
I mean, what if he doesn't recognize me?

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.526
No, don't answer that, either.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.199
So, Hallie said he was a... a hunk.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:29.616
He was rather dishy.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:33.083
He had a smile that made me go weak
at the knees, if you can imagine that.

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:37.667
- OK. I'm all set, Mom.
- Great. Me too. Almost.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.711
Mom, your suitcase is,
like, totally empty.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.380
Oh. Right. Sorry. Um...

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.139
Did you speak to your father, dear?

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.722
Um... Yeah, yeah.
I just hung up with him, actually.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:50.103
He said he's really anxious to see you.

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:53.557
Anxious nervous,
like he's totally, completely dreading it?

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.693
Or anxious excited,
like he's looking forward to it?

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:59.445
- Anxious excited. Definitely.
- Oh.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:03.609
He said he'll meet us tomorrow at noon
at the Stafford Hotel in San Francisco.

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:07.242
My, my, my. That's incredibly soon,
isn't it? Well. Um...

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:09.872
Why don't you run downstairs
and gather up our tickets

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.580
from your grandfather
while I finish up here?

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:13.747
OK.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:17.088
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.
- Sh!

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:21.719
Oh, Martin, I have a really ridiculous,
somewhat childish request to make.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.879
Martin, you know
that you're more than a butler to me.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:27.174
You're more like a lovable brother
who just happens to wait on us and...

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:30.059
- Anyway, I was wondering if...
- I'd accompany you on the trip?

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:33.438
- Make it a bit easier for you?
- Would you, Martin? Thank you so much.

01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.441
I'd be so grateful. And you don't even
have to come as our butler,

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.567
- just as a friend.
- Madam, I'd be honored.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.603
And may I say, as a friend,

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:45.367
if I was seeing my ex, after 11 years,
and I had your legs...

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:48.657
I'd wear this little baby.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:52.115
You'll kill in it.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.711
- Bye, Daddy, darling.
- Bye, darling.

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.172
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:08.803
- Bye, Pop.
- Bye, Hal.

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:10.933
So you're coming to Napa
for Thanksgiving, right?

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.470
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.310
Bye.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:20.109
Oh, and say hello to your father for me.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.395
I will.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.201
Airport, please.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:55.012
OK. They'll be here any minute.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:57.146
Now, be nice, Daddy.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:01.185
He's everything you ever wanted
for your little girl, plus millions more.

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.228
Then you know I'll be nice.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.232
Oh, OK. There he is.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:11.073
With the whole motley crew.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.198
Hi, darling.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:22.001
Hallie. Chessy. And Sammy.
What in the world are you doing here?

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:24.040
Honey, a dog at the Stafford?

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:27.461
- Hal begged me to bring him.
- Oh, you're such a softy.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.970
Oh!

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:32.177
Good doggy. So, Meredith, these the folks?

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:35.310
Yes. Mom, Dad, you finally meet.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:39.268
This is my fiancé and the love of my life,
Nicholas Parker.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:42.730
Hello, Nicholas.
I'm so pleased to meet you.

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:44.690
- I'm Vicki.
- Hi.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:47.321
And this is Nick's
adorable daughter Hallie.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.534
This entire prenuptial get-together
was her idea, I'll have you know.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:54.743
How are you, young lady? We've heard
nothing but wonderful things about you.

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:59.034
Hello, pet.
You may call me Aunt Vicki.

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.598
- Other end, madam.
- Whoops.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:23.187
That was a great flight, wasn't it?
I mean, it was so quick.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.727
I've never seen you
quite so thirsty before, madam.

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:29.864
Well, would you believe, Martin, darling,
I've never tasted vodka before this trip?

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.366
Could have fooled me, ma'am.

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:34.202
Come on. Let's rock and roll.

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.738
I am in such major trouble here.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.914
If the hotel can do it, I think that room
is perfect for the wedding.

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.543
Not too big, not too cramped.

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:45.956
And not that I don't like the idea
of having the wedding at the house,

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.591
it's just that this could be amazing.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:52.592
So I've already checked us in.
Why don't we go upstairs, freshen up,

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:54.381
and then rendezvous for lunch?

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.845
- Great.
- Meet you in the bar in ten. OK?

01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:58.347
Perf.

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:03.606
Sweetheart, now that we're here, why don't
we go check out the honeymoon suite?

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:06.484
I bet it is to die for.

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:15.281
Oh, whoops. I forgot my bag.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.491
Hang on.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.993
Sammy.

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:22.041
Sammy!

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:28.881
- Sammy!
- Excuse me. Did you find a beige...

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.041
Thank you.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:32.551
- Ooh.
- Mum!

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:36.385
Darling, you didn't have to wait for me.
I could have found the room by myself.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.800
Besides, I need to get a little fresh air.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:41.352
Go on, sweetie. I'll meet you upthairs.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:45.727
I like that jacket, by the way.
Were you wearing that

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.893
- the whole time we were on the plane?
- Mum, watch out!

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:49.694
Sorry, sorry.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:56.201
She's drunk. She's never had more
than one glass of wine in her entire life,

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:59.078
and she chooses today
to show up totally zonked.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:03.083
Yeah, well. Just do what the woman says
and meet her "upthairs."

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.710
Maybe that's why they make
"do not disturb" signs.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.220
Alone at last.

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:28.812
Hallie Parker.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.317
Oh, don't do this to me.
I'm already seeing double.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:37.321
- It's me, Mum. Annie.
- Oh, darling.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:41.036
You look wonderful.

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:45.200
Oh, my girls.

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:50.463
I can't believe you're together.
But how could you do this to me?

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:54.592
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt, but...

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:59.218
might I suggest that we continue
this little powwow inside?

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:03.263
- Hi. You probably don't remember me.
- Chessy.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:08.018
I knew I always liked her.

01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:11.400
One of you... I'm not sure
which one at the moment,

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:15.109
but one of you told me your father
knew I was arriving here today.

01:23:15.282 --> 01:23:18.400
And I'm here to tell you
that the man I just saw in the elevator

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:21.490
had absolutely no idea
he and I were on the same planet,

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:25.039
- let alone in the same hotel.
- You saw Dad already?

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:28.668
Yes, I did.
The man went completely ashen,

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.545
like I was
the bloody Ghost of Christmas Past.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.002
Can one of you
get something cold for my head?

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:36.919
I mean, don't you think I've pondered
what it was going to be like

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.052
to see your father
after all these years?

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:41.590
Well, let me tell you,
me waving like a mindless idiot

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.009
while Nick Parker's wrapped
around another woman's arms

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:48.180
is not exactly the scenario
I had in mind. No, sirree.

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:52.476
Martin! What are you doing?

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:55.020
Going for a dip, madam.
Do you mind?

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:58.110
No, no. No, that's perfectly perfect.

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:00.991
Have fun.
Someone ought to.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.447
Hello.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.954
Hello. Hello to you.

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:06.614
Chessy,
this is our butler, Martin.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.826
How do you do? I'm her butler.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.462
<i>Enchanté, mademoiselle.</i>

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:17.375
Gee. The pleasure's all mine, monsieur.

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.213
Girls, you were going to tell me
why you lied

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.508
and brought me here
without telling your father.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.768
Were they? OK, that's good. Uh...

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:30.351
Well, I'm just gonna go back to my room
and check out the old mini-bar situation.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:32.937
- Allow me to assist you.
- Wait.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:36.653
Does everyone here
know something I don't know?

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:41.570
Mum, Daddy's getting married.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:48.331
To Cruella De Vil. She's awful, Mum.
We can't let him go through with it.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.866
She's all wrong for him, Mom,

01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:52.535
and the only way
he won't marry her is if...

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:54.666
You tell her. She knows you better.

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:59.588
Is if he sees you again.

01:25:00.178 --> 01:25:04.138
Wait a minute. You're not trying
to set me up with your father?

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:07.426
Actually, we are.
You're perfect for each other.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:10.721
Hold it! You two knew about this?

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:13.731
- What? Oh! No.
- No.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.814
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Madam, no, absolutely. I had no idea.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:22.111
- Yes. Yes, I did know something.
- Yes. Technically, yes. I had an inkling.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:24.617
- Hallie told me the story.
- It was their idea. It was so sweet.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.448
I just fell for the story.
I'm an old romantic.

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:27.612
Yeah, so am I.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.155
OK. OK.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:32.166
Let me say this loud and clear.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:36.079
Nick Parker and I
have absolutely nothing in common...

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:37.580
anymore.

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:40.796
Plus, in case you haven't noticed,
he seems extremely content

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:44.258
with his leggy, tight-skirted,
bare-backed fiancée.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.889
And I want the two of you
to explain to your father

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.597
that I am here for one purpose,
and one purpose only.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:52.137
And that is
to switch the two of you back.

01:25:52.314 --> 01:25:55.432
Now, let's do what we have to do
and be done with it.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:56.645
Understood?

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:01.063
- Hey, Dad. What's up?
- Hi. Just running down to the lobby.

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:02.275
- Hey, Hal.
- Huh?

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:05.692
Do me a favor, will ya, while I'm gone?
Will you just look after Meredith for me?

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:06.859
Huh? Thanks.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.278
- Hallie. Hallie.
- Yeah?

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:10.947
How do I look?
Like, presentable and everything?

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:14.583
- Not too old?
- You look fab, Dad. Young and fab.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:24.419
Dad.

01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:27.551
I thought you were gonna
keep Meredith company.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.883
I was? I mean, I am, yeah.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:32.097
I was just looking for her, actually.

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.058
It's great to see you, Dad.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.065
It's great to see you too, squirt.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.023
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, thanks.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:44.321
Well, go on. Get up there. Come on.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:47.150
<i>Let's get together, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.694
<i>Why don't you and I combine?</i>

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.992
<i>Let's get together...</i>

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:54.202
- Have you seen your father?
- You talking to me?

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:57.540
What, are you Robert De Niro?
Yes, I am talking to you.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:00.126
Oh, Meredith.

01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:04.008
- Uh... Yeah. I just saw him.
- Well, hello. Where was he?

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:06.510
Uh... He went thataway. I think.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.850
- What are you staring at?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:20.141
You're just really very pretty.
That's all.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:21.308
Oh...

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:25.196
Don't tell me you're gonna break your
rotten streak and suddenly be nice to me.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:28.608
If you see your father,
tell him he's late and I'm waiting.

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:33.575
Whatever you say, Cruella.

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:44.461
Here you go.
This'll cure anything you've got.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:48.131
- Just don't ask what's in it.
- OK.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.468
Here's to...

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:56.553
Here's to you. May your life be
far less complicated than mine.

01:27:57.022 --> 01:27:58.138
Thank you.

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.056
Ugh.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:04.110
Martini, dry, please.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:08.989
I beg your pardon.
I think I just drank tar.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:13.244
There's your martini,
and your bill, Miss James.

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:14.574
Thank you.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:25.290
You're Elizabeth James?

01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:29.210
- Guilty.
- Oh!

01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:31.845
I just saw a wedding dress
you designed in <i>Vogue</i>

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.881
and fell completely in love with it.

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:36.517
I faxed your office just yesterday,
and they said that you were out of town

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:40.643
and didn't know if you could make another.
I can't believe it. It's fate.

01:28:40.816 --> 01:28:43.524
- I'm Meredith Blake.
- How do you do?

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.161
Sorry.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:02.876
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:07.415
Where have you been?
We've been looking all over for you.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.300
Nicholas, I think this hotel
is perfect for the wedding.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.713
- The more I see of it, the more I like it.
- Me too.

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:16.136
Absolutely.

01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:23.105
Now, tell me, dear. How many are we
expecting from your side of the family?

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:24.686
Just a guesstimate.

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:29.187
Uh... Can I get back to you on that?
I... I'm not sure at the moment.

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:31.906
Excuse me.

01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:34.651
Pardon me. Sorry.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.363
- Oh! Boss, you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:42.284
- Uh... Sir.
- Dad, watch out!

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.294
- Oh! Careful!
- Argh!

01:30:07.694 --> 01:30:09.777
- Hello, Liz.
- Hello, Nick.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.778
Well, gosh. There you are.
What do you know?

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:18.285
Uh... Is there something going on here
that I should know about?

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.697
Because I'm stunned to see you.

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:24.367
But, uh... you don't seem
as stunned to see me.

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:29.961
I mean, I haven't seen or heard from you
in, what, ten, eleven years.

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:32.959
- All of a sudden, on the very day that...
- Dad.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.423
I can explain why she's here.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:38.214
Hallie, you know who this is?

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:42.886
Actually, yes.
And, actually, I'm not Hallie.

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:46.097
Actually, I am.

01:30:46.983 --> 01:30:48.349
Both of them?

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:52.857
Annie?

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:54.688
Hallie?

01:30:54.866 --> 01:30:59.361
I guess you and Mum kind of think alike,
'cause you both sent us to the same camp.

01:30:59.537 --> 01:31:03.622
We met there, and the whole thing
just sort of spilled out.

01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.455
They switched places on us, Nick.

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.087
You mean I've had Annie with me
all this time?

01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:15.047
Well, I wanted to know what you were like,
and Hallie wanted to know Mum, and...

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:19.172
- Are you angry?
- Oh, honey. Of course not.

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:22.220
I just can't believe it's you.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:29.349
Last time I saw you, you had diaper rash.
Oh, sorry - you're all wet.

01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:31.267
- It's all right.
- Look at you.

01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:36.944
Well, I'm quite grown-up now,
and quite without a father.

01:31:37.283 --> 01:31:40.242
And I'm headed into my crazy,
mixed-up teenage years,

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:43.655
and I'll be the only girl I know
without a mother to fight with.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.287
Hallie, you've been in London
all this time?

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.127
Come here, squirt.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:58.882
Mom's amazing, Dad.
I don't know how you ever let her go.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:05.010
Girls, why don't you let your father and I
talk alone for a couple of minutes, OK?

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:08.395
- Sure, fine.
- Take your time.

01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:11.599
I don't believe this.

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:16.403
Seeing them together, seeing you.

01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:19.156
- Ow.
- Ooh. Let me help you with that.

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.032
Oh, excuse me.
Do you have a first-aid kit?

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.534
Yeah, of course.

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:25.741
Why don't you lie down?

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.034
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:33.079
So... how are you, Lizzie?

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:36.416
Or does everyone call you Elizabeth now?

01:32:36.926 --> 01:32:39.384
Oh, no, no. Lizzie's... Lizzie's fine.

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.841
- My dad still calls me Lizzie.
- Yeah?

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.428
- Yeah, I've been... uh, been terrific.
- Oh.

01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:49.728
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:54.734
Finally. There you are.
Oh! Uh... Oh, good. You've met.

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:58.776
Honey, Elizabeth designs wedding gowns,
and she's going to make my...

01:32:58.948 --> 01:33:03.113
Wait, um... I don't understand.
How did you two meet?

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:05.661
And, Nicky, why are you all wet?

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.662
You're making my fiancée's wedding gown.

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.074
- Well, I didn't know she was your fiancée.
- Well...

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.459
How did we meet?
How did you two meet?

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:17.294
- Am I missing something here?
- Know what? This is one small world.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:18.924
How small?

01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:20.960
- Hi, Mer.
- Hello.

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:24.301
How you doing?

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:28.009
Honey, did I ever mention to you
that Hallie was a twin?

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.972
No, I'm afraid
you forgot that little detail.

01:33:32.148 --> 01:33:35.391
Don't feel bad, Mer,
he never mentioned it to me, either.

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:38.902
By the way, I'm the real Hallie.
This is Annie.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:42.861
She was pretending to be me,
while I was pretending to be her.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:47.449
And this is our mother, Elizabeth James.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.363
This is your mother?

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:50.577
Yes.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.491
You were married to him?

01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:54.702
- Yeah.
- Guilty again.

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:58.964
- Oh, well. This is a small world.
- And getting smaller.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:03.299
And what a coincidence that we're all here
on the exact same weekend.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:07.260
My, my, my. How sweet.

01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:15.807
Hal, I've had enough surprises
for one day.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:18.397
Will you please
just tell me where we're going?

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:21.153
You're gonna love it, Dad. Trust me.

01:34:22.949 --> 01:34:24.065
Hello.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.201
Hey.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:33.624
So...

01:34:34.711 --> 01:34:37.203
Do you have any idea
where they're taking us?

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:39.963
- Not a clue.
- Right.

01:34:58.234 --> 01:34:59.475
Where are we?

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.822
This is where we're eating?

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.450
No, actually,

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.786
that's where we're eating.

01:35:12.957 --> 01:35:14.539
She's ours for the night.

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:20.496
Wow. So how exactly
are we paying for this?

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:22.960
Well, we pooled our allowances.

01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:27.299
- Yeah, right, Annie.
- OK. Grandfather chipped in a bit.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:30.673
- Annie.
- OK. He chipped in a lot.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.933
Come on.
You guys are gonna love it.

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:34.510
Pretty snazzy.

01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:39.649
Elizabeth and Nick,
your dinner awaits you.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:48.611
Girls.

01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:58.617
The table's only set for two.

01:35:58.795 --> 01:36:04.666
Oh. That's the other part of the surprise.
We're not joining you.

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:08.795
- You're not?
- No, but I am.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:11.968
Good evening. I'm Chessy,
and I'll be your server this evening.

01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:15.430
- No wisecracks, please.
- And I am Martin, your sommelier.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.679
May I offer you both a taste of the bubbly

01:36:17.855 --> 01:36:20.222
in the hope
that you'll get a bit schnockered

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.359
and not fire this lovely lady and myself

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:27.067
for following the orders
of these audacious 11-year-olds?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.573
Annie, mood music, please.

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:41.494
Just relax. Sail through time.

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:44.129
Back to yesteryear.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:53.468
- You do get all this, don't you?
- Yes, I'm beginning to.

01:36:57.103 --> 01:37:00.562
They're recreating the night we met.
The boat, the music...

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:02.064
The help.

01:37:02.942 --> 01:37:04.649
It's so sweet.

01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:06.685
Martin, I think I'll take that drink.

01:37:09.699 --> 01:37:11.065
Thank you, Martin.

01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:14.826
Oh. Yeah.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:23.331
To tell you the truth,
I haven't been on a boat since the <i>QE2.</i>

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:24.836
Neither have I.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:29.004
Well, then, here's to, uh...

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:30.463
Our daughters.

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:33.379
Our daughters.

01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:42.305
Now I know how a goldfish feels.

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:47.768
You know, sometime
if we're ever really alone,

01:37:47.945 --> 01:37:52.736
maybe we could talk about
what happened between us.

01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.860
It all feels a bit hazy to me now.

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:58.578
It ended so fast.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:01.415
It started so fast.

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.701
Well, that part I remember perfectly.

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:10.757
Looks like things are heating up
quite nicely.

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:13.510
I'd say it's safe
to serve the vichyssoise.

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:15.341
You ladle, I'll serve.

01:38:19.018 --> 01:38:20.805
I'm sorry.

01:38:25.858 --> 01:38:28.225
Yes, I'll ladle.

01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:31.733
Right. And then I'll...

01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:35.448
- Serve?
- Right.

01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:36.734
Right.

01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:42.240
So... you've done
fantastically well.

01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:47.207
Your dream of owning your own vineyard,
it actually came true.

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.499
What about you? You were always drawing
on napkins and corners of newspapers.

01:38:51.676 --> 01:38:53.838
Now you're this major designer.

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:55.252
Yeah. It's great.

01:38:56.806 --> 01:38:59.298
We both actually got
where we wanted to go.

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:01.967
Yeah. We did.

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:07.556
Anyway, what are we going to do
about the girls?

01:39:07.733 --> 01:39:10.476
Well, now that they've met,
we can't very well keep them apart.

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:14.067
Well, I could keep them for half the year,
and then you could keep them for...

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.654
Guys, they can't go to two
different schools every year. That's nuts.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:18.908
I agree.

01:39:19.078 --> 01:39:21.661
Well, I could keep them both
for a whole year, and you...

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:24.323
- Liz, that's why we came up with...
- Mm-mm. Mm-hm.

01:39:25.918 --> 01:39:29.753
Oh. Sorry. Ignore me. Enjoy your soup.

01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:33.169
That's why we came up
with the solution that we have.

01:39:33.342 --> 01:39:38.838
Really? I thought it was because
we decided never to see each other again.

01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:40.802
Not "we," Liz.

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:45.140
Well, you know, that part's become
a bit hazy to me too over the years.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:49.182
- You don't remember the day you packed?
- No, that day I remember perfectly.

01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:53.523
Did I hurt you when I threw that, um...
What was it? A...

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.904
It was a hairdryer.

01:39:56.073 --> 01:39:57.314
Oh. Right.

01:39:58.534 --> 01:39:59.650
Sorry.

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:05.952
You know, I may never
be alone with you again.

01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:11.837
So, about that day that you packed...
Why'd you do it?

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:17.635
Oh, Nick. We were so young
and we both had tempers.

01:40:17.803 --> 01:40:20.762
We said stupid things and so I packed.

01:40:20.932 --> 01:40:24.141
Got on my very first 747 and...

01:40:25.478 --> 01:40:27.140
You didn't come after me.

01:40:28.564 --> 01:40:30.977
I didn't know that you wanted me to.

01:40:33.486 --> 01:40:35.819
Well, it really doesn't matter anymore.

01:40:36.489 --> 01:40:39.482
So let's just put a good face on
for the girls

01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:41.571
and get this show on the road, huh?

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:47.035
Yeah. Sure.
Let's get this show on the road.

01:40:54.799 --> 01:40:57.041
Your passport, Ms. James.
Have a safe trip home.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:58.299
Thank you.

01:40:59.011 --> 01:41:02.675
- All set, then? Where's Annie?
- I just rang up. She's on her way down.

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:04.093
Right.

01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:09.178
So I'll send Hallie back to you
over Christmas.

01:41:09.355 --> 01:41:11.438
And Annie'll spend Easter with you.

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:20.568
Annie, what are you doing in those
clothes? We've got a plane to catch.

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:25.452
Here's the deal, Mom. We thought it over,
and we decided we're being totally gypped.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:30.036
Dad promised we'd go on our camping trip,
and we wanna go. Together.

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:31.325
What camping trip?

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:34.085
The one we go on
every summer before school starts.

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.668
Annie, this is ridiculous.
Go upstairs and put your clothes on.

01:41:36.882 --> 01:41:39.750
- Are you sure I'm Annie?
- Well, of course I'm sure.

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:43.091
But it's kind of hard
to be 100 percent positive, isn't it?

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:47.554
Girls, this is totally unfunny. You're
gonna make your mother miss her airplane.

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.509
- Annie.
- Yes?

01:41:57.403 --> 01:41:59.645
This one's Hallie. I'm positive.

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:01.484
You know, I hope you're right, Dad,

01:42:01.657 --> 01:42:05.196
because you wouldn't wanna send
the wrong kid all the way back to England.

01:42:06.412 --> 01:42:07.528
Would you?

01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:16.169
Here's our proposition.

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:20.298
We go back to Dad's house,
pack our stuff,

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:23.336
and the four of us
leave on the camping trip.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.054
- The four of us?
- And when you bring us back,

01:42:26.223 --> 01:42:27.839
we'll tell you who's Annie
and who's Hallie.

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:32.102
Or you do as we say, and I take
one of you back with me to London,

01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:33.887
whether you like it or not.

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:43.647
And what am I supposed to do
for three days? Sit home and knit?

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:46.366
Honey, we have kind of a sticky situation.

01:42:46.535 --> 01:42:51.280
Sticky situation? What do you mean,
sticky situation? What exactly...?

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.784
Excuse me. What is she doing here?

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.577
You see, that's part of the deal.

01:42:57.755 --> 01:43:01.920
- The four of us, we go together.
- What are you, suddenly the Brady Bunch?

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:04.551
- This is ridic...
- Hello. Everything all right?

01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:07.174
Well, no, actually, it isn't.

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:10.136
I didn't realize that you were
going on this little outing,

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:13.598
and to tell you the truth
I'm not so sure that I'm OK with it.

01:43:13.771 --> 01:43:18.106
I agree. I think the ex-wife in the next
sleeping bag is a little weird.

01:43:18.609 --> 01:43:19.349
Thank you.

01:43:19.443 --> 01:43:22.481
I absolutely insist
that you come with us. Really.

01:43:23.656 --> 01:43:25.363
- Liz...
- No, honestly, Nick,

01:43:25.533 --> 01:43:28.276
I've messed up your entire weekend.
It's the least I can do.

01:43:28.452 --> 01:43:29.818
Really. Please.

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:45.759
- Dad, what's Meredith doing here?
- Your mother invited her.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.089
What?

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:48.962
Be nice.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:03.818
OK. All set? Have fun, everyone.

01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:07.026
- What?
- Liz, what are you doing?

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:11.618
Well, I really think that you and Meredith
need some time alone before the big day.

01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.994
Mom, come on. That's not the plan.

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:16.373
Oh, honestly,
you'll have much more fun without me.

01:44:16.542 --> 01:44:19.034
Wait, wait. If you're not going,
I certainly don't have to go.

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.794
I mean, trust me,
I'm not a big nature girl.

01:44:21.964 --> 01:44:24.297
But this is your chance
to really get to know the girls.

01:44:24.467 --> 01:44:28.086
I mean, after all, starting next week
they're... they're half yours.

01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:35.842
Have fun, all of you.

01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:42.644
Bye-bye.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.853
Oh, I would pay big money
to see that woman climb a mountain.

01:44:49.158 --> 01:44:51.150
- Don't hurry, honey.
- OK.

01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:57.071
Whoa!

01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:58.957
Come on, you guys.

01:44:59.752 --> 01:45:00.993
Whoa. Whoa.

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.051
I'm gonna kill my trainer.

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:20.642
He says I'm in such great shape.

01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:23.936
I can't believe
people actually do this for fun.

01:45:25.402 --> 01:45:27.359
Hold on. We're stopping.

01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:32.529
Again? Dad, at this rate it'll take us
three days just to get to the lake.

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:35.528
Meredith isn't used
to the altitude. Just chill.

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.032
OK?

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:46.372
Oh, I'm in serious pain.
Somebody hand me my Evian.

01:45:47.299 --> 01:45:48.460
I can't move.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.376
Sure.

01:45:56.392 --> 01:45:57.508
Brilliant.

01:46:03.107 --> 01:46:04.188
Here you go, Mer.

01:46:12.825 --> 01:46:14.566
Honey, you OK?

01:46:14.743 --> 01:46:19.078
- What happened?
- This little guy was on her Evian bottle.

01:46:19.248 --> 01:46:21.160
Oh. He won't hurt you, Mer.

01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:24.664
Oh, right, right, right.
I... I know. You...

01:46:25.796 --> 01:46:28.755
go ahead. I'll be fine.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:34.674
Get that thing away from me.
I hate things that crawl. Ugh.

01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:37.305
How can you touch that?
Just... put it down.

01:46:37.516 --> 01:46:39.508
OK, OK, I'll put it down.

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:44.346
- Girls...
- What?

01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:46.515
- What?
- I'm going to take the lead.

01:46:46.692 --> 01:46:48.979
The two of you help Meredith. All right?

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.984
Sure you'll help me.
Right over a cliff, you'll help me.

01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:57.742
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah. See any cliffs?

01:46:57.912 --> 01:47:00.074
Oh, my backpack.

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:02.372
Need a hand, Mer?

01:47:04.126 --> 01:47:06.459
Not from you, thank you.

01:47:06.795 --> 01:47:09.754
Don't think I can't see
right past those angelic faces.

01:47:09.924 --> 01:47:13.759
One more trick from you two and I promise
I will make your lives miserable

01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:16.386
from the day I say, "I do."

01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:18.555
Got it?

01:47:20.059 --> 01:47:21.766
Got it, Cruella.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:25.557
What did you call me?

01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:29.983
Nothing, nothing.
Not a thing, Cruella.

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:34.776
Oh, by the way, Mer,
I think there's something on your head.

01:47:50.506 --> 01:47:51.622
Are you all right?

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.215
What... happened?

01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:02.758
Ask them.

01:48:08.691 --> 01:48:11.354
What did we do, Dad?
We were right behind you.

01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:16.404
- This is really good.
- Yeah, I know.

01:48:16.949 --> 01:48:20.033
Here we go, girls.
This'll hold us for a while.

01:48:25.082 --> 01:48:26.914
Sure you don't want some trout, Mom?

01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:29.701
Is that OK, by the way,
if we start calling you Mom?

01:48:30.295 --> 01:48:33.208
I think your mother would prefer
if you called me Meredith.

01:48:33.382 --> 01:48:38.719
And no, thank you, I do not eat trout,
for the thousandth time.

01:48:38.887 --> 01:48:41.925
I will wait until breakfast.
What are we having?

01:48:42.099 --> 01:48:44.136
- Trout.
- Oh.

01:48:44.309 --> 01:48:47.427
- Come on, it's part of the experience.
- Mm, and what's the other part?

01:48:47.604 --> 01:48:49.516
Being eaten to death by mosquitoes?

01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:52.148
God, you'd think
they actually like this stuff.

01:48:52.443 --> 01:48:54.901
Well, what's that you're using?
Here, let me see that.

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:01.862
You're gonna attract
every mosquito in the state

01:49:02.036 --> 01:49:05.074
with this stuff. It's sugar
and water. Where'd you get it?

01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:13.166
That's it. I am taking one large
sleeping pill and going to bed.

01:49:20.137 --> 01:49:21.218
Meredith?

01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:23.513
What are you doing?

01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:25.928
I don't want the mountain lions to...

01:49:28.604 --> 01:49:31.347
There are no mountain lions
up here, are there?

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.016
No.

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:51.828
Good night.

01:49:57.091 --> 01:50:00.209
Girls, I'm telling you, lay off.

01:50:00.385 --> 01:50:04.174
This isn't her thing, OK? I'm not
marrying her because she's Annie Oakley.

01:50:04.473 --> 01:50:07.762
- Who's Annie Oakley?
- Just cool it.

01:50:25.619 --> 01:50:27.827
- Come on, come on.
- OK.

01:50:29.915 --> 01:50:33.079
I hope
that one large sleeping pill worked.

01:50:40.384 --> 01:50:42.717
- You take that side.
- All right.

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:47.551
Gosh, she's heavy.

01:50:47.724 --> 01:50:49.681
She's also, like, snoring.

01:50:58.777 --> 01:51:00.018
Nicky?

01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:30.052
Sweet dreams, Mommy dearest.

01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.985
That feels nice.

01:52:01.673 --> 01:52:04.962
Nicky!

01:52:08.055 --> 01:52:09.591
Oh, man.

01:52:11.016 --> 01:52:12.223
Ooh.

01:52:27.491 --> 01:52:30.404
- What's going on?
- Here's what's going on, buddy.

01:52:30.619 --> 01:52:34.283
The day we get married is the day
I ship those brats off to Switzerland.

01:52:34.456 --> 01:52:37.620
Get the picture? It's me or them.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:39.292
Take your pick.

01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:43.124
Them.

01:52:43.966 --> 01:52:47.960
- Excuse me?
- T-h-e-m, them.

01:52:49.763 --> 01:52:51.004
Get the picture?

01:53:08.156 --> 01:53:12.366
Hello. You're back so soon.
Did you have fun?

01:53:12.577 --> 01:53:16.036
- Well, I wouldn't go right to fun.
- You wouldn't?

01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:18.823
We've been punished
to the end of the century.

01:53:19.001 --> 01:53:21.618
Starting now. Go.

01:53:22.379 --> 01:53:23.620
Where's Meredith?

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.039
We played a couple
of harmless tricks on her

01:53:26.216 --> 01:53:27.832
and she kind of freaked out a little.

01:53:28.093 --> 01:53:29.174
A little?

01:53:30.429 --> 01:53:31.465
Hm.

01:53:32.973 --> 01:53:35.010
She threw this at my head.

01:53:36.393 --> 01:53:38.259
Least it's smaller than a hairdryer.

01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:42.105
Oh, Nick, it's all my fault.
If I hadn't suggested she go...

01:53:42.274 --> 01:53:44.982
Oh, tricked.
Tricked would be more like it.

01:53:45.736 --> 01:53:47.352
Like mother, like daughters.

01:53:47.988 --> 01:53:49.695
I really am sorry.

01:53:50.032 --> 01:53:52.399
- We are too, Dad. Really.
- Yeah.

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:55.114
Up to your room. Now.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.452
I gotta remember to thank them one day.

01:54:08.216 --> 01:54:10.424
So, where's Chessy? I'm starving.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:17.057
Well, she and Martin went off
on a picnic around noon... yesterday.

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:21.391
Really? Who would have thought?
My nanny, your butler. Hm.

01:54:22.981 --> 01:54:25.473
So, what do you say
I whip us up something to eat?

01:54:25.942 --> 01:54:29.606
- You can cook now?
- Oh, yeah. I can make pasta

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:31.521
and pasta and...

01:54:32.032 --> 01:54:33.523
Pasta sounds good.

01:54:33.992 --> 01:54:35.233
Pasta it is.

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:43.286
OK, I'll take two.

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:49.005
- Hey, Dad.
- Wow, you look so nice.

01:54:49.216 --> 01:54:50.798
Where are you going?

01:54:51.635 --> 01:54:53.171
Good night, ladies.

01:55:01.978 --> 01:55:03.514
Oh, wow.

01:55:03.688 --> 01:55:05.975
This is where I keep my private stash.

01:55:06.483 --> 01:55:09.271
- Did you know I also collect wine?
- Really?

01:55:09.444 --> 01:55:11.731
Mm. I'm a man of limited interests.
Come here.

01:55:14.866 --> 01:55:17.984
This is a 1921 Burgundy.

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:22.409
They say the rain that year made this
the best Burgundy ever harvested.

01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:23.952
Oh.

01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:27.335
Now, you will appreciate this. Come here.

01:55:37.347 --> 01:55:38.428
Look.

01:55:39.558 --> 01:55:42.266
V-J Day 1945.

01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:45.186
- That's incredible.
- I love that.

01:55:50.861 --> 01:55:54.275
Now, this is the same wine
that was served at my parents' wedding.

01:55:54.448 --> 01:55:56.030
Bordeaux, '52.

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:59.192
I think my sister
was conceived on this baby.

01:56:02.289 --> 01:56:08.206
What's this one?
"Where dreams have no end." 1983.

01:56:09.004 --> 01:56:11.337
That one, actually,
took me years to track down.

01:56:11.756 --> 01:56:13.042
Why? Where's it from?

01:56:15.469 --> 01:56:18.428
It's the wine that we drank
at our wedding.

01:56:21.057 --> 01:56:23.265
I now have every bottle ever made.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:26.556
You do?

01:56:28.273 --> 01:56:29.389
I do.

01:56:33.195 --> 01:56:36.688
- Can we open one?
- You're the only one I'd drink it with.

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:42.284
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah.

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:44.995
Just got a little dust
in my eye, that's all.

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:48.875
- I can offer you a clean sleeve.
- No, no, I'm fine, really.

01:56:49.211 --> 01:56:50.372
All better.

01:56:52.964 --> 01:56:55.798
You don't always
have to be so brave, you know.

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.592
Oh, but I do, actually.

01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:09.353
That will be Chessy.

01:57:10.649 --> 01:57:12.106
She has a key.

01:57:24.037 --> 01:57:26.529
Hello? Anybody home?

01:57:29.501 --> 01:57:30.742
We'll be right up.

01:57:55.986 --> 01:57:57.602
<i>Oh</i>

01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:00.529
<i>Every time</i>

01:58:02.617 --> 01:58:05.530
<i>We say goodbye</i>

01:58:07.247 --> 01:58:10.991
<i>I die a little</i>

01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:15.161
<i>Every time</i>

01:58:16.506 --> 01:58:20.170
<i>We say goodbye</i>

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:25.755
<i>I wonder why a little</i>

01:58:27.142 --> 01:58:31.477
<i>Why the gods above me</i>

01:58:32.856 --> 01:58:39.820
<i>Who must be in the know</i>

01:58:42.282 --> 01:58:45.946
<i>Think so little of me...</i>

01:58:46.119 --> 01:58:47.576
Take care of yourself.

01:58:48.038 --> 01:58:50.451
Yeah, I will. You too.

01:58:54.628 --> 01:58:55.744
Bye.

01:59:04.679 --> 01:59:06.671
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:14.182
<i>I can hear</i>

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.730
<i>A lark somewhere</i>

01:59:20.362 --> 01:59:25.983
<i>Begin to sing about it</i>

01:59:27.285 --> 01:59:31.495
<i>There's no love song finer</i>

01:59:32.916 --> 01:59:36.626
<i>But how strange the change</i>

01:59:37.587 --> 01:59:41.547
<i>From major to minor</i>

01:59:42.592 --> 01:59:45.335
<i>Every time</i>

01:59:46.137 --> 01:59:50.848
<i>We say goodbye</i>

02:00:05.907 --> 02:00:08.399
Hello? We're home.

02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:10.117
Grandfather?

02:00:10.829 --> 02:00:12.240
I'll check the study.

02:00:20.046 --> 02:00:21.503
Hey, stranger.

02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:28.377
Hey, Mom. Did you know that Concorde
gets you here in half the time?

02:00:29.472 --> 02:00:31.179
Yes, I've heard that.

02:00:34.561 --> 02:00:36.302
What are you doing here?

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:39.180
It took us around 30 seconds
after you guys left

02:00:39.357 --> 02:00:41.940
for us to realize
we didn't wanna lose you two again.

02:00:43.194 --> 02:00:44.230
We?

02:00:48.658 --> 02:00:49.694
We.

02:00:51.995 --> 02:00:54.783
I made the mistake of not coming
after you once, Lizzie.

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:59.041
I'm not gonna do that again,
no matter how brave you are.

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.335
And I suppose you just expect me to go
weak at the knees and fall into your arms

02:01:05.508 --> 02:01:08.797
and cry hysterically and say,
"We'll just figure this whole thing out."

02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:10.677
A bicontinental relationship

02:01:10.847 --> 02:01:14.807
with our daughters being raised
here and... and there and...

02:01:15.685 --> 02:01:19.349
and you and I just picking up
where we left off and...

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:23.057
and growing old together and...

02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:25.814
and...

02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.146
Come on, Nick, what do you expect?

02:01:29.616 --> 02:01:31.903
- To live happily ever after?
- Yes.

02:01:32.869 --> 02:01:34.360
To all the above.

02:01:34.954 --> 02:01:37.287
Except you don't have to cry hysterically.

02:01:38.917 --> 02:01:40.579
Oh, yes, I do.

02:02:18.498 --> 02:02:20.285
We actually did it.

02:02:22.377 --> 02:02:23.913
<i>This will be</i>

02:02:24.045 --> 02:02:25.661
<i>An everlasting love</i>

02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.123
<i>This will be the one I've waited for</i>

02:02:29.676 --> 02:02:30.792
<i>This will be</i>

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:35.342
<i>The first time anyone has loved me</i>

02:02:37.433 --> 02:02:41.017
<i>I'm so glad you found me in time</i>

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:44.851
<i>And I'm so glad that
you rectified my mind</i>

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:46.105
<i>This will be</i>

02:02:46.985 --> 02:02:50.695
<i>An everlasting love for me, yeah</i>

02:02:50.905 --> 02:02:52.487
<i>Whoa</i>

02:02:52.657 --> 02:02:56.241
<i>Loving you
is some kind of wonderful</i>

02:02:56.452 --> 02:03:00.116
<i>Because you've shown me
just how much you care</i>

02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:03.374
<i>You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime</i>

02:03:03.543 --> 02:03:07.036
<i>And made me believe
you've got more thrills to spare</i>

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:09.079
<i>Oh, this will be</i>

02:03:09.841 --> 02:03:12.584
<i>An everlasting love</i>

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.752
<i>Oh, yes, it will, now</i>

02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:22.559
<i>You've brought
a lot of sunshine into my life</i>

02:03:23.187 --> 02:03:26.601
<i>You've filled me
with happiness I never knew</i>

02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:29.859
<i>You gave me more joy
than I ever dreamed of</i>

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:34.029
<i>And no one, no one
can take the place of you</i>

02:03:34.407 --> 02:03:35.614
<i>This will be</i>

02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:37.441
<i>You and me</i>

02:03:38.036 --> 02:03:39.493
<i>Yes, sirree</i>

02:03:39.954 --> 02:03:41.115
<i>Eternally</i>

02:03:41.706 --> 02:03:43.242
<i>Hugging and squeezing
and kissing and pleasing</i>

02:03:43.416 --> 02:03:45.533
<i>Together, forever,
through rain or whatever</i>

02:03:45.835 --> 02:03:48.748
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you and me</i>

02:03:49.005 --> 02:03:50.917
<i>So long as I'm living,
true love I'll be giving</i>

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:53.332
<i>To you I'll be serving
'cause you're so deserving</i>

02:03:53.509 --> 02:03:56.126
<i>Hey, you're so deserving</i>

02:03:56.304 --> 02:03:57.590
<i>From now on</i>

02:03:58.139 --> 02:03:59.755
<i>From now on</i>

02:04:00.058 --> 02:04:01.344
<i>From now on</i>

02:04:01.976 --> 02:04:03.512
<i>From now on</i>

02:04:03.978 --> 02:04:05.389
<i>From now on</i>
