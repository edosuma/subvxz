00:03.680 --> 00:05.440
(theme music playing)

01:09.480 --> 01:12.320
(serene music playing)

01:18.160 --> 01:21.080
(car approaching)

01:30.680 --> 01:32.960
(keys jingling)

01:33.040 --> 01:35.040
Daddy's home.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.840
-Hey. Hi, honey.
-Daddy, daddy, daddy!

01:43.440 --> 01:45.920
Hello... anybody here?

01:46.520 --> 01:47.480
Anybody?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.040
I'm home.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.280
-You never said he has stubble.
-He doesn't, usually.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.520
(fridge opens)

02:03.120 --> 02:04.200
So I'm going.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.840
I'm catching the third street bus.
You coming?

02:06.920 --> 02:09.400
No, Amber said she'd pick me up later.
Okay?

02:09.480 --> 02:10.880
Sure. Okay.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
Bye.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.520
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.960
Oh, look!

02:23.040 --> 02:25.560
-Rickie and your dad are bonding.
-Come on.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.480
Well, bye.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.120
Bye.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.440
They're exchanging fashion tips.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.320
-Rayanne!
-Hey.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.840
(Rayanne, Angela laughs)

02:38.200 --> 02:39.280
So...

02:39.920 --> 02:42.080
is, uh, this the famous Rayanne?

02:42.160 --> 02:44.320
This is the famous Angela's dad.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.640
(kisses)
Dad, your whiskers scratch.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.680
Oh. Sorry.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.640
-I did it!
-Good. Turn down your flame.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.080
Okay. You're in the zone now.
The next batch will be great.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.560
You feel like something else, honey?
You want me to make some fritters.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.520
-I'll have fritters.
-I can make you something else.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.840
I feel so hungry. Do you ever
get like hypnotized by food?

03:05.920 --> 03:10.120
Oh, are you kidding me? Hypnotized
by food could be my Indian name.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.600
-Honey, you want to flip one?
-Rayanne, can do it.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.880
I got to call my brother.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.360
I can't believe I am cooking
something not in a pouch.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.360
(Rayanne gasps)

03:21.440 --> 03:22.880
I'll still eat it.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.800
That's a weird-sounding beep,
Neil.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.680
Hey, listen, you know that guy
Earl, I did that rush for?

03:28.760 --> 03:33.240
He laid two tickets on me
to the Dead concert, Thursday night.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.760
-Oh, my God.
-Save the date. Call me back.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.160
Okay, bye.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.000
You're into The Dead?

03:40.080 --> 03:42.200
This explains so much.
(chuckles)

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
Oh, yeah?

03:44.200 --> 03:48.080
Oh, the like undercurrent
of connections between Angela and me.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.080
My mom's going to
the Dead show Thursday night.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.120
She's a former morph rat. The Grateful
Dead is this thing that we totally share.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.760
Before she had me,

03:56.840 --> 03:59.840
she lived in a bus for like months
with a girl named Pop Tart.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.040
Why, Angela's not really
into The Dead. Am I right?

04:03.760 --> 04:06.680
Oh, you will be after
you hear our bootleg stuff.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.840
My mom got this tape
from this guy.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.520
Maybe you know him,
Mike in Boulder, Colorado.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.880
Palo alto '71.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.600
-They closed with "Cosmic Charlie."
-Right. I was there.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.280
(Rayanne)
Get out of here! (chuckles)

04:19.240 --> 04:20.480
Nice save.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.520
Sweetheart, may I speak to you
for a moment?

04:23.600 --> 04:24.400
Sure.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.680
(Angela) <i>When you're not sure</i>
<i>you trust a person anymore</i>

04:27.760 --> 04:29.880
<i>say a person you really trusted...</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:31.840
<i>say your father...</i>

04:32.320 --> 04:34.960
<i>you start wishing they'd do</i>
<i>something like really wrong,</i>

04:35.040 --> 04:36.760
<i>just so you could</i>
<i>be right about them.</i>

04:36.840 --> 04:39.000
Okay, bear with me. I'm upset.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.320
I know how you feel about her.
She's actually not a bad kid.

04:42.960 --> 04:46.240
That Rayanne person? Oh, please.
She's the least of my problems.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.760
-Good. Angela wants her to stay to dinner.
-Fine. I don't care. Whatever.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.800
Listen, we... got a really
upsetting letter today.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.040
Oh, man.

04:59.440 --> 05:03.600
-The IRS. It's not the "A" word.
-I can't believe we're being audited.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.680
At least,
Wood &amp; Jones printing is.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.440
"Your federal income tax return
has been selected for examination."

05:10.520 --> 05:12.840
They must get
Stephen King to write these.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.080
I called, daddy's coming over in a little
while so we can figure out what we...

05:16.160 --> 05:19.280
You told your dad about this
before you told me?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.520
Honey, look at the date '92.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.480
That's the year he got sick,
the year I took over.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.120
-He was not pleased.
-He's been caught red-handed.

05:27.200 --> 05:32.280
Graham, he was in a hospital the spring
of '92. If anyone's to blame, it's me.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.160
I am the one who prepared
the return.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.560
-He was too cheap to hire an accountant.
-(Patty groans)

05:36.640 --> 05:40.440
Promise me...
we will handle this in our own way.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.840
Handle what?

05:42.880 --> 05:45.440
Nothing.
Well, we're being audited.

05:45.520 --> 05:48.200
Well, not us, exactly.
Wood &amp; Jones printing.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.440
Which, of course, is us.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.720
Why...
did you lie about something?

05:53.560 --> 05:55.800
-Why are you looking at me?
-Nobody lied.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.320
This happens to anyone.
They pick people at random.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.880
But I'll lay even
money that grandpa lied.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.920
So, can Rayanne still stay
for dinner?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.520
Yes. Yes.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.440
Just checking.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.400
-Did you see that?
-Do you hear that? "Just checking."

06:14.680 --> 06:16.880
Did you notice that tone
she takes with me now?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.440
I didn't notice anything.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.680
(Patty sighs)

06:20.760 --> 06:23.760
Something's not right between
her and me. She acts so...

06:26.440 --> 06:28.600
uh, distant, with this sort
of...

06:29.800 --> 06:31.000
silent contempt.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.840
Graham, she adores you...

06:34.520 --> 06:37.360
and I've got dibs on her silent
contempt, okay?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.400
(Danielle chuckles)

06:41.480 --> 06:44.000
This is the hardest
homework I've ever seen.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.720
Look at this.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.480
I like when you don't shave,
daddy.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.280
-You do?
-I like how it feels.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.720
(Danielle chuckles)

06:53.800 --> 06:55.760
I can't concentrate in here.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.720
Ah. Finally.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.720
I found a copy of the return.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.760
(knock on door)

07:08.160 --> 07:10.520
Got a rain gutter out
there about to fall off.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.320
This just in.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.920
Hits someone on the head,
and you'll have a lawsuit on your hand.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
-Yeah. We know, dad.
-Hi, grandpa.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.080
Hello, cookie.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.440
Okay, that's enough.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.000
Place lit up like
a Christmas tree you know that.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.600
Got every light
in the house blazing.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.520
Trying to support the electric
company single handed?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.560
Dad, would you like anything?
Some fruit or...

07:29.640 --> 07:31.160
What have you got there?

07:31.240 --> 07:34.360
Well, this is a copy
of the '92 return.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.640
Ran my own business
for 30 years.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.200
-Never got audited.
-Dad...

07:38.280 --> 07:41.800
-they pick people at random.
-Yeah? Never picked me, then.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.600
Well, anyway, they do.

07:44.320 --> 07:47.120
-Send a girl to do a man's...
-What did you say, dad?

07:47.720 --> 07:49.480
Never mind.
It's not worth repeating.

07:50.560 --> 07:57.240
So they do say that when a small business
like us takes a noticeably large deduction

07:57.320 --> 07:59.440
-that's hard to justify...
-Who would do that?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.880
Well, dad, look here. The car.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.960
-See, you took off 87%.
-It was a business car.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.720
I know, but that's the kind of deduction
that you have to back up with a log or...

08:10.800 --> 08:12.840
-Hey, there's my girl.
-Daddy.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.480
-Hiya, honey bunch.
-Hi, grandpa.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
How are you?

08:18.840 --> 08:19.960
This is good.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.760
-(serene music playing)
-(Angela chuckles)

08:23.840 --> 08:25.680
You don't jump on
me like your sister.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
You got big.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.920
-(serene music continues)
-(Angela chuckles)

08:42.960 --> 08:45.240
You are good kid, okay,
just give me the Walkman things.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.800
-I don't have a Walkman.
-You do, all right.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.080
I'll give it back after school.
Just give the Walkman.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.360
Catalano,
give her the stupid Walkman.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.560
God, people are so rude.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.160
So not to shock you,
but your dad's attractive.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.200
-Oh, I'm sure.
-Not that I'd attack him or anything...

09:03.960 --> 09:05.760
but I wouldn't leave me alone
with him either.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.440
So when I was leaving, he
was there, and I was like, hi,

09:09.520 --> 09:13.080
and he was like, hi.
And I was like, well, bye. He was like...

09:13.160 --> 09:16.800
It's not just physical.
He... he's nice.

09:17.800 --> 09:19.920
You just...
have a really nice dad.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.760
He's really nice.

09:21.840 --> 09:25.200
(Angela) <i>When someone compliments</i>
<i>your parents, there's like nothing to say.</i>

09:25.920 --> 09:27.760
<i>It's like a stun gun</i>
<i>to your brain.</i>

09:27.840 --> 09:30.640
But... plus his stubble
is the perfect length.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.280
He doesn't have stubble.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.920
He ran out of disposable razors,
he was all disturbed about it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.040
Oh, in touch with his emotions
dad.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.680
Shut up!

09:40.280 --> 09:42.640
Ignore Angela.
She can't help herself.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.640
She's the product
of a two-parent household!

09:45.720 --> 09:47.480
(Rayanne chuckles)

09:47.560 --> 09:51.680
(Danielle) I know. Mom's been on
the phone forever. We're getting audited.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.280
I talked to Neil. He said we're crazy
to do this without an accountant.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.720
You're right. We shouldn't go
into this thing like unprepared,

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
but I know him.
He'll never agree to...

10:03.480 --> 10:06.000
Honey, I don't know what trouble
your dad's gotten us into,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.480
but if they found something,
we got to pay up, you know?

10:12.080 --> 10:13.080
Where's Angela?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.560
Locked in her room
with that Rayanne person. Why?

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
I just wondered.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.040
She hasn't said two
words to me all week.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.240
Join the club.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.160
Oh, I almost forgot.
We have a time.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.880
Are you listening?
To meet with the IRS lady.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.440
This Thursday, four o'clock.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.920
No, that's easy to remember.
Same day as the concert.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
What?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.160
Oh, I never mentioned Earl gave me
two free tickets to the Dead concert.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.560
-You're kidding.
-Oh, honey, come on. It's The Dead.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.080
-Graham.
-Honey!

10:47.160 --> 10:48.280
Please,

10:48.360 --> 10:54.680
please tell me you are not going
to top off our audit with a rock concert.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.000
Please, Graham.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.360
So you don't want me to go?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.400
-(dogs barking indistinctly)
-(car honking)

11:00.480 --> 11:02.400
-It's, uh...
-Amber.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.520
Vallone.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.000
I'll get Rayanne.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.720
(knock on door)

11:10.640 --> 11:11.640
Rayanne, your mom's here.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.800
I got to find my sock,
'cause it's Rickie's.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.760
So, Which day's your mom
going to see The Dead?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.280
Thursday. Her and her honey.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.760
She'd never let him hit
Pittsburgh and not make it.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.400
Ah! Yes.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.960
So, would you two
like to go with them?

11:29.520 --> 11:30.560
To see The Dead?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.720
Oh, my God, Angela.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.760
-But you really want to go.
-I got work to do.

11:39.840 --> 11:42.080
Anyway,
I'm too old for that stuff.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.160
So what do you think?
Would you like that?

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
Sure.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.400
Thank you!

11:49.480 --> 11:52.560
I mean thank you so...
Night, Ange! Night.

11:52.640 --> 11:53.800
Good night.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.560
I know you're not wild about
The Dead like Rayanne is,

11:58.640 --> 11:59.640
-but...
-No, it's fine.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.840
(door closes)

12:02.320 --> 12:03.600
So where are the tickets?

12:04.920 --> 12:07.720
Oh, here.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.400
(car engine sputtering indistinctly)

12:24.880 --> 12:27.160
I found all those receipts
I forgot I had.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.920
Saw a dirty book, a pearl
earring I was so upset about,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.880
and a birthday card
I never sent my mother.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.000
What book?
(Graham clears throat)

12:36.720 --> 12:38.080
I want that back.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.080
Uh, I've decided to skip
the concert.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.720
-Thank goodness.
-(Graham chuckles)

12:48.000 --> 12:50.600
Yeah, I gave the tickets to,
uh, Angela and Rayanne.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.000
(Patty giggles)

12:54.480 --> 12:55.480
What?

12:56.160 --> 12:57.160
Seriously?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.600
Oh, yeah. It'll be fine. It turns out
that Rayanne's mother is going to go.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.640
Well, of course
Rayanne's mother is going,

13:05.720 --> 13:08.120
and Heidi Fleiss
is probably meeting her there,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.960
but that doesn't mean
that Angela should go.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.120
Patty, listen...

13:12.200 --> 13:16.000
And, to top it all off,
it's a school night!

13:16.440 --> 13:20.080
I mean, could you have had
a more completely terrible idea?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.840
(sirens blaring at distance)

13:24.920 --> 13:26.280
I'll get the tickets back.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.280
I didn't think it through.
I was...

13:29.920 --> 13:31.280
(sighs) you still awake?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.440
Just my brain.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.000
I'm so ashamed.
I feel like I've been bad.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.320
Government's going to ground me.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.720
Angela's really acting
weird toward me, you know?

13:44.600 --> 13:48.280
I think I'll have to ask my dad
to butt out of this.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.600
It's like she's holding something
against me or something.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.920
How can I do that?
How can I question his judgment?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
He... built this
business out of nothing.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.680
He's this rare individual...

13:58.760 --> 14:01.280
Patty you're 10 times smarter
than your dad about business.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.280
Turn that off.
I can't watch that guy.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.000
-I miss Johnny.
-(chuckles) I know.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.240
I felt for Johnny,
married to all those Joannes.

14:12.320 --> 14:17.160
I think of him all alone on some
godforsaken Malibu beach.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.960
No guests. God, I miss him.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.040
-(TV turns off)
-Look...

14:24.960 --> 14:27.360
I'll call him tomorrow
and take him to lunch.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.960
At that new place with the fountain,
that does all the non-fat cooking.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.520
Mom's been
wanting me to take him there.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.440
-That's a great idea.
-Yeah.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.400
It'll be on my turf

14:36.480 --> 14:39.800
and my terms, and I'll wait for just
the right moment, and I'll say...

14:39.880 --> 14:41.280
Chili fries?

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
Come on. Taste one.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.200
When's the last
time you had chili fry?

14:45.880 --> 14:46.960
I couldn't say.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.600
Probably tastes better
than that place you suggested...

14:50.120 --> 14:54.720
you know, with the no fat, no cholesterol,
no flavor. No, thank you.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.040
-Dessert?
-None for me.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.760
Bring her some banana cream pie.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.200
-Dad, I don't want pie.
-I may have a bite.

15:01.280 --> 15:04.600
-You can't have sugar.
-It's banana. It's all-natural.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.040
Dad... about the audit, uh...

15:09.120 --> 15:12.240
Oh. I almost forgot.
My driving log.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.120
-You kept a driving log?
-You see it. Don't you?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.560
(waitress) Banana cream pie.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.480
Dad.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.400
You know, not that you did,
but... they can tell if...

15:25.000 --> 15:27.400
Patricia...
it's perfectly legally go.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.520
Reconstruction of what happened.
Best of my ability.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.800
I spoke to her.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
To the IRS agent?

15:35.840 --> 15:37.120
Dad, we agreed...

15:37.200 --> 15:39.520
She doesn't mind us doing
this without an accountant.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.040
Well, of course not.
She's probably thrilled.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.520
They want to trip you up.
They have got all sorts of techniques.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.840
Hey, I can handle the IRS.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.840
What I can't handle
is my daughter telling me what to do.

15:50.920 --> 15:55.640
-(upbeat music playing)
-(glasses clink)

15:57.560 --> 16:00.120
You don't know
what you're missing.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.080
-Aah! No! Stop it!
-Stop it!

16:04.160 --> 16:06.920
(indistinct conversations)

16:07.000 --> 16:08.120
Good one!

16:09.480 --> 16:12.200
Excuse me! Excuse me!

16:12.280 --> 16:15.640
Whose classroom is this?
Whose classroom is this?

16:16.240 --> 16:18.360
-Mayhew's.
-And where is Ms. Mayhew?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.440
She's out of here.
She couldn't deal.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.320
-Aren't you guidance?
-Yes.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.320
We need guidance,
Ms. Krzyzanowski.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.520
I have a question!

16:25.600 --> 16:29.720
Okay, one at a time. Yes.
Okay, girl with the red hair.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.080
It's Ms. Mayhew's class,
but I think she quit.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.240
Who has been
teaching this class?

16:35.320 --> 16:36.480
Uh, Mr. Renaldi.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.280
Mr. Renaldi's a Spanish teacher.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.920
-This is English.
-Yeah, right.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.400
Well, what did Mr. Renaldi do
last time he was here?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.160
-He showed a movie.
-What movie?

16:46.240 --> 16:48.680
<i>-Alive.</i>
-Where is Mr. Renaldi now?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.160
Hey, Catalano.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.000
Mr. Catalano. Join us.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.760
Okay, I'm going to pair you off.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.440
You're going to write three
sentences on the movie <i>Alive.</i>

17:00.520 --> 17:03.360
And you'll trade papers
and diagram those sentences.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.480
And I'm going to sit here and watch
because my life is so empty.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.840
Okay, you and you, you and you,

17:10.920 --> 17:12.280
you and the boy in blue,

17:12.360 --> 17:16.680
and you... the pink shirt,
you and you.

17:18.920 --> 17:23.360
(Angela) <i>I couldn't believe Jordan</i>
<i>was trying to diagram my sentences.</i>

17:24.920 --> 17:26.720
<i>His sentences were really short.</i>

17:35.080 --> 17:36.600
(chain zips)

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
Tickets.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.240
For the Grateful Dead concert.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.440
Not that I like
The Grateful Dead that much.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.440
(Angela) <i>You know, how sometimes the last</i>
<i>sentence you said echoes in your brain</i>

17:58.520 --> 18:00.520
<i>and it just keeps</i>
<i>sounding stupider?</i>

18:02.120 --> 18:04.320
<i>You have to say something else</i>
<i>just to make it stop.</i>

18:04.400 --> 18:07.840
Oh, I just remembered,
I am... I owe you $30.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.800
Uh, for the I.D.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.240
I don't have it on me,
but... I...

18:18.800 --> 18:21.360
-scalp your Dead tickets.
-Really?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.960
I don't know anyone
who'd buy them, do you?

18:27.040 --> 18:31.040
(upbeat music playing)

18:31.120 --> 18:34.160
-You scalped our Dead tickets?
-Shh! Rayanne.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.680
You want me to talk to him.
Maybe he hasn't sold them yet.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.160
I just seemed, I mean, you're always
saying we should find ways to make money.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.520
You want me to? To talk to him?
Because I am willing to do it.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.720
What are you talking about?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.480
Why are you talking about money?

18:47.200 --> 18:49.520
We had Grateful Dead tickets.

18:50.480 --> 18:53.200
People don't sell Grateful
Dead tickets.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.480
People give people
Grateful Dead tickets.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.160
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it was...

18:58.240 --> 19:00.720
Your dad gave those tickets
to both of us.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.600
Including me.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.160
-(bell rings)
-I got to go to home Eric.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.200
-Oh, my God.
-(door closes)

19:13.280 --> 19:14.800
She must really be upset.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.520
Why'd you do it?

19:18.680 --> 19:20.680
I mean, to have a reason
to talk to Jordan?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.280
Not completely.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
Then, why?

19:29.480 --> 19:30.600
I don't know.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.400
Dad, the meeting
should be at the IRS office.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.880
Yeah, but... you don't know that
she has an appointment

19:39.960 --> 19:41.480
with a chiropractor
in this neighborhood.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.120
She may have told you that,
she can get a good look at... what?

19:47.040 --> 19:48.080
Okay.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.280
Yes. Say good night to mom.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.640
I'm so scared.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.160
It's okay.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.880
Prison's not that bad.
And... and I'll wait for you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.240
Now he's got that
agent coming here.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.840
It's exactly what all the books
say never to do.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.320
-I can't get him to listen.
-Patty... listen...

20:16.800 --> 20:20.560
you order people around
all day long... people like me.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.760
Lunch was a disaster.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.840
He forced me to order pie,
and I actually ate it.

20:30.360 --> 20:35.240
What is wrong with me? Why do
I become an 8-year-old around him?

20:39.400 --> 20:42.840
So,
my rotten day is like foreplay?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.040
I like it when you're...

20:50.840 --> 20:53.920
-when you actually need me.
-Of course, I need you.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.040
Did you talk to Angela...
about the concert?

21:04.280 --> 21:06.120
Uh, I will.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.200
I promise.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.680
-What are you doing?
-Get out of here.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.200
(Angela)<i> I didn't know</i>
<i>what I was looking for...</i>

21:32.120 --> 21:34.880
<i>some kind of... proof...</i>

21:35.440 --> 21:38.560
<i>something that would make it</i>
<i>make sense for me to hate him.</i>

21:41.600 --> 21:46.560
(upbeat music playing)

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
I... I lost...

21:54.440 --> 21:55.480
part of my homework.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.360
Did you find it?

22:00.280 --> 22:01.280
No.

22:01.800 --> 22:07.200
(upbeat music continues)

22:18.160 --> 22:21.960
(theme music playing)

22:35.480 --> 22:38.760
(upbeat music playing)

22:50.000 --> 22:52.320
-Miss Mandeville.
-Mrs. Chase.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.520
(clock ticking)

22:59.600 --> 23:00.800
That was my grandmother's.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.880
She was completely dotty, of course.
It's practically worthless.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.280
Keeps good time, though.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.960
Then it's not worthless.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.600
You see, I was the one who
actually prepared the return.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.240
Uh, Miss Mandeville?

23:22.880 --> 23:26.240
I don't know if your records
indicate this, but I am a veteran.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.920
So...

23:28.000 --> 23:30.520
I just didn't want to conceal it,
that all.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.400
I would also like to add that...
during that fiscal year question,

23:35.480 --> 23:38.360
I was felled by a near-fatal
heart attack...

23:39.400 --> 23:42.920
and was later found
to be sick with diabetes.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.080
Well, you look just fine now.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.480
I shouldn't be
penalized for bouncing back.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.560
-Why are you telling me this Mr. wood?
-No reason.

23:53.040 --> 23:57.200
We've covered a lot of ground.
Thank you. This was helpful.

23:57.280 --> 23:58.720
You can keep it if you like.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.200
-That won't be necessary.
-Oh, God.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.440
I forgot to talk to Angela
about the concert.

24:04.680 --> 24:08.640
(sighs) Anyway, it's obvious we'll
be seeing lots more of each other.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.840
Promise you'll keep
that in mind, Mr. Wood.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.240
You won't go gallivanting off
on some Caribbean vacation.

24:14.320 --> 24:15.320
What?

24:16.160 --> 24:18.960
I have been to the
Caribbean exactly once.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.400
In '56.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.680
You're telling me you
don't take lavish vacations?

24:22.760 --> 24:26.320
-I got the distinct impression that...
-Lavish?

24:26.400 --> 24:30.240
My wife won't fly. She gets seasick.
I've never been to Europe.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.560
You told me you
take lots of time off.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.200
We have to...
we have to get away.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.680
But those are motoring trips,
you know.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.200
We've always taken those,
like into the mountains.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.800
Sounds fun.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.920
-Uh, what car do you use?
-The wagon.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.280
I mean... either car.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.920
-The compact usually.
-Okay...

24:52.240 --> 24:54.880
-Here is what we're going to do.
-This has nothing to do with you.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.120
We're going to pay the taxes
we owe.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.200
Pay what? What did you just say?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.120
-Chuck, come on.
-Daddy, please, just...

25:01.200 --> 25:03.840
Just what? Just said here,
and you sell me down the river?

25:03.920 --> 25:05.520
Daddy, I'm trying to help you
here.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.000
Help, man?
I don't need your help.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.240
Do we have an agreement?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.480
We absolutely have an agreement.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.560
Agreement? Who the hell are you
to make an agreement?

25:13.640 --> 25:15.800
-Hey.
-Daddy, please.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.280
Chuck, come on.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.680
Do what you want.
I don't give a damn.

25:22.760 --> 25:29.000
-(serene music playing)
-(door shuts)

25:33.080 --> 25:35.680
Thank you.
You have been very patient.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.360
-I'm, uh, sorry that...
-(door closes)

25:40.200 --> 25:43.200
-Angela? I have to...
-Dad, I can't talk right now.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.240
Angela.

25:50.640 --> 25:52.960
I'm just sorry you had to
witness that...

25:53.680 --> 25:55.880
business between me
and my father.

25:59.560 --> 26:02.160
Small potatoes
compared to what I've seen.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.840
We've got a problem.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.080
It's my mistake. I should have
talked to your mother first.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.240
The thing is, I can't allow you
to go to that concert tonight.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.520
What?

26:19.600 --> 26:22.320
Your mother is
just not comfortable with it.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.280
I'm sorry.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.320
You better give
the tickets back.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.960
-Why do you need the tickets?
-Why do you need them if you're not going?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.520
Just give them back.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.560
Rayanne has them...

26:38.160 --> 26:39.480
and she's going to
be here any second.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.440
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry!

26:41.520 --> 26:44.120
She's gonna... she's counting on me
to come. And I'm not gonna do this to her.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.760
Angela, let me call Rayanne.
I'll explain it to her.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.880
-It was your idea.
-I made a mistake.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.040
-I'm not perfect.
-Oh, leave me. That's become really clear.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.240
There she is.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.960
Angela. Ang...

27:02.640 --> 27:05.240
-What the hell is going on?
-She get into Rayanne's car?

27:05.320 --> 27:06.800
She's gone.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.280
I cannot believe
that you let this go this long.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.640
Patty, I forgot. All right.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.840
Oh, come on,
why don't you just admit it?

27:14.920 --> 27:17.520
You want her to go to this stupid concert.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.240
All right! I admit it, okay?

27:20.320 --> 27:22.720
I saw The Grateful Dead
when I was 15-years-old.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.080
It was one of the
eight best nights of my life.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.240
It was something
I wanted to give her.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.160
Oh, fine. Leave.
Just like he does.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.920
Leave my father out of this.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.960
-What? What did you say?
-It's not worth repeating.

27:36.880 --> 27:43.120
-(upbeat music playing)
-(Graham sighs)

27:46.080 --> 27:48.640
And Brian,
make sure the lid's on tight.

27:49.360 --> 27:52.920
(dogs barking at distance)

28:01.000 --> 28:02.360
(car door opens)

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
Hi.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.440
It wasn't locked, and...
I can't go home right now.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.880
There's nowhere else to go...
and I'm freezing.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.440
Are you like,
meeting someone in here?

28:22.680 --> 28:24.200
That's so unfunny.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.560
What about... my room?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.440
What about your parents?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.440
They won't even notice.
They're balancing their joint checking.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.120
Mine are getting audited.

28:40.400 --> 28:42.880
Mine are probably
getting a citation for like...

28:42.960 --> 28:45.640
best penmanship on
a tax return or something.

28:45.720 --> 28:49.120
Can I just stay here,
just for a while?

28:50.880 --> 28:52.560
How come you can't go home?

28:54.880 --> 28:57.120
My dad thinks
I'm at a Grateful Dead concert,

28:57.200 --> 28:59.600
and he'd be really upset
if he knew I wasn't.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.080
Wow.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.760
Your dad is so different
from my dad.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.400
Look, it's... my car.
I think I have a right to know.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.360
Does this involve
Jordan Catalano?

29:24.400 --> 29:25.920
Angela, wait.

29:26.960 --> 29:30.200
Did you ever think I could actually be
doing something that does not involve you?

29:30.280 --> 29:32.480
That I may not be sitting around
in case you decide like,

29:32.560 --> 29:34.360
that moment, you need my car?

29:35.160 --> 29:37.160
-So, what were you doing?
-Nothing.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.040
You want my sweater?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.120
Okay.

29:55.120 --> 29:57.280
Just try not to sweat into it.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.120
Why do you have
to say things like that?

29:59.200 --> 30:00.000
Why you have to...

30:00.080 --> 30:01.840
Brian,
there's another bag of garbage here!

30:03.040 --> 30:05.440
-I know!
-Tonight, Brian! Not next week.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.280
(Angela)
<i>What's really horrible...</i>

30:07.360 --> 30:11.040
<i>is being a witness while someone's</i>
<i>parents orders them around.</i>

30:11.120 --> 30:12.880
<i>It ruins the conversation.</i>

30:13.840 --> 30:15.240
So what were you saying?

30:15.720 --> 30:17.200
Nothing. Just...

30:18.840 --> 30:22.440
You shouldn't act one way towards a person
when you need something, and then...

30:22.520 --> 30:27.640
(serene music playing)

30:53.040 --> 30:55.480
-Danni, juice?
-Ew, not the pulp kind.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.040
-Oh. Right.
-I'll take some.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.480
You left your Scottie sweater
in my car, honey.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.080
Thanks. I was searching.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.640
Angela, orange juice doesn't
grow on trees.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.040
It sort of does.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.080
Did you see how he's being?

31:18.360 --> 31:19.920
Don't call your father "He."

31:20.600 --> 31:24.000
He didn't want me to go to the
concert, so, fine. I didn't go.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.440
But you let him
think you were going.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.440
You sold tickets you
had no business selling,

31:29.520 --> 31:32.760
and you were less than forthright,
to say the least.

31:32.840 --> 31:36.320
Why can't he just say that instead
of acting like I don't exist?

31:38.160 --> 31:42.720
Dad not even wanting to look
at me is like, the worst feeling.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.360
I know.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.640
-Rayanne! Rickie!
-It was so beyond. Oh, my God.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.640
Finally. I've been
looking everywhere for you guys.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.480
Anyway, I'll see you at lunch.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.120
I can't believe she's this mad.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.480
I know, but see, I can see it
from your side.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.960
I also see it from
her side and my own side.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.120
I don't really have a side.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.520
Anyway, why'd you do it?

32:15.120 --> 32:17.280
I mean,
were you mad at your dad?

32:18.160 --> 32:19.360
What? Who said that?

32:19.880 --> 32:21.480
Well, with my dad...

32:22.320 --> 32:24.520
who's technically my uncle,
but he raised me...

32:25.280 --> 32:28.880
if he gives me something
and I'm mad at him,

32:28.960 --> 32:30.120
I can't open it.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.160
But that's different 'cause...

32:33.960 --> 32:35.400
I'm somewhat afraid of my dad.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.680
I mean, in the past,
my dad has broken down my door.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.520
My dad always knocks.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.720
I had a feeling.

32:56.200 --> 33:02.840
(indistinct conversations)

33:15.640 --> 33:16.720
Rayanne?

33:19.440 --> 33:21.640
Rayanne, I feel terrible, okay?

33:25.160 --> 33:27.080
And I have to go to health
for few minutes.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.400
Why?

33:30.080 --> 33:31.880
Why do I feel terrible?

33:32.960 --> 33:34.000
Yeah.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.360
-Because...
-(door opens)

33:38.040 --> 33:39.320
of what I did.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.360
-That you didn't get to go to the concert.
-(door closes)

33:41.440 --> 33:42.480
(toilet flushes)

33:42.560 --> 33:45.240
No, I did. It was great.
They played "Stagger Lee."

33:47.080 --> 33:48.080
Amber and Rusty took me.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.520
Rusty ran into this guy he knew
from Vietnam who's in a wheelchair.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.120
He had an extra ticket.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.840
He had a sexy upper body, too.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.600
Making you feel bad is too easy.
Takes all the fun out of it.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.160
Look... your dad probably
gives you stuff all the time.

34:14.240 --> 34:17.320
So, It's no big deal to you.
But to me...

34:20.800 --> 34:23.720
the fact that he... did that...

34:26.960 --> 34:29.880
face it. I'm envious.
I'm a green-eyed monster.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.560
You don't know everything
about my dad.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.200
Remember the night we couldn't
get into let's bolt?

34:49.920 --> 34:53.520
I saw him around the corner from our
house, and he was talking to this girl...

34:55.000 --> 34:56.600
like in her 20s.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
So?

35:04.840 --> 35:05.880
So...

35:07.800 --> 35:08.800
I've been lucky.

35:08.880 --> 35:12.280
My dad's had like, eight
different girlfriends since he left.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.080
I'm used to it.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.680
But, Angela...

35:20.120 --> 35:23.920
whatever your dad may be doing,
with... whatever girl...

35:24.560 --> 35:26.640
and you don't even know
if he is,

35:26.720 --> 35:30.600
he's still the type of dad that
would lay two Dead tickets on you.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.600
Out of nowhere.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.880
(mellow music playing)

35:37.960 --> 35:39.600
That's what matters.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.320
(bell ringing)

35:46.640 --> 35:52.520
(serene music playing)

36:13.040 --> 36:14.040
Daddy?

36:15.560 --> 36:16.640
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

36:16.720 --> 36:19.080
Patricia, you want to give
me another heart attack?

36:20.640 --> 36:22.400
What are you doing working
so late?

36:23.240 --> 36:24.240
What's all this?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.360
That's my master plan, dad.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.920
I want Wood &amp; Jones printers to move
into the world of high-speed copiers.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.480
Did you read it?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.080
What do you think?

36:37.800 --> 36:40.240
It's a lot of money
to spend in one swoop.

36:40.320 --> 36:44.560
That's what exactly I thought, Dad.
Then it came to me, lease it.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.760
That way it only costs about
eight grand a month.

36:47.840 --> 36:52.680
I know that's not peanuts, but, oh, Dad,
it looks like offset.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.600
People won't have to
go to an offset printer.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.800
They can come to us.
We can keep more stuff in-house.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.840
I see you got it
all figured out.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.480
You know, I could work 16 hours a day,
and it wouldn't be enough.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.560
You know how late I work.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.120
I know you came
here to make up with me.

37:16.720 --> 37:18.760
Me? (scoffs)

37:19.720 --> 37:21.120
I'm still waiting
for an apology.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.560
You'll be waiting a while.

37:28.760 --> 37:30.480
Dad, I have opinions.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.240
I have to have them,

37:34.320 --> 37:37.920
stick to them... make decisions.
I have to.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.000
-You asked me to when you...
-I didn't ask you to bank...

37:42.080 --> 37:43.800
No, dad, you have to hear this!

37:44.560 --> 37:49.520
When you asked me to take over,
when you asked me to run this business,

37:50.120 --> 37:53.240
maybe you didn't know what
you were asking. God knows I didn't.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.840
Sometimes I miss how it
used to be when I never...

37:58.200 --> 37:59.480
questioned you.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.120
But I... I've turned some sort
of corner with this, and I can't go back.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.480
Yeah, well, that's your...

38:10.160 --> 38:11.360
that's your own business.

38:17.440 --> 38:22.680
Why does there have to be this
distance between us?

38:24.200 --> 38:25.600
Well, that's not my doing.

38:29.840 --> 38:35.680
(slow music playing)

38:41.840 --> 38:42.880
All right now.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.600
It's all right.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.200
Careful, I...
I didn't shave today.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.120
Didn't have to.
Good thing about retirement.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.640
I don't care.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.800
(mellow music playing)

39:02.200 --> 39:03.360
When you were a little girl...

39:05.560 --> 39:07.400
I'd go to give
you a kiss good night.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.840
Boy, if I hadn't shaved,
you'd push me away.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.880
You said my whiskers
were too rough.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.360
Well, they were then.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.280
That's what it is to raise
a girl...

39:23.360 --> 39:25.240
walking on eggshells
half the time.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.880
You hungry?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.720
Come on,
I'll buy you a piece of pie.

39:33.800 --> 39:38.960
(serene music playing)

39:53.240 --> 39:55.000
(Patty) I thought you were
asleep hours ago.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.840
So it seems that the breakup
of the Beatles had...

40:03.720 --> 40:07.000
less to do with Yoko Ono
and more to do with the fact

40:07.080 --> 40:11.640
that Paul wanted Linda's father
to be their new business manager.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.960
Why do you think people
give her such a hard time?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.120
Is it just
because she can't sing?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.320
I've worked so hard...

40:29.920 --> 40:31.920
to please him, you know?

40:38.240 --> 40:39.960
He doesn't realize...

40:42.760 --> 40:44.920
what this all costs me.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.000
He's never really known...
what I'm worth.

40:58.480 --> 41:01.160
(sighs)
You know, sometimes I think...

41:02.520 --> 41:06.680
that I partly married you
because... I knew...

41:08.080 --> 41:09.080
Knew what?

41:12.280 --> 41:14.720
That you'd be
a really good father.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.920
A different kind of father.
And you are.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.160
Graham.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.200
Listen to me.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.440
I don't want to lose her.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.520
But you have to,
just for a little while.

41:31.600 --> 41:35.840
You have to let her push you
away and not punish her for it.

41:36.240 --> 41:40.000
All she's doing... is
pushing you off your pedestal.

41:40.080 --> 41:44.240
She's right to do that. She has to do it.
She's right on schedule.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.200
She's not 1,000 years late...

41:48.960 --> 41:50.680
like I am.

41:55.440 --> 41:58.040
So... so, um, what do I do?

42:01.800 --> 42:03.480
Stand your ground.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.360
You let her know that...

42:07.120 --> 42:10.080
no matter how hard
she pushes you away...

42:11.480 --> 42:13.080
you'll still be there.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.160
I love you.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.480
I love you, too.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.400
So much.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.040
(Graham sighs)

42:37.920 --> 42:43.760
(upbeat music playing)

42:49.520 --> 42:51.160
<i>♪ I told Althea ♪</i>

42:51.240 --> 42:54.640
<i>♪ I was feelin' lost ♪</i>

42:55.400 --> 42:58.520
<i>♪ Lackin' in some direction ♪</i>

43:00.720 --> 43:02.320
<i>♪ Althea told me ♪</i>

43:02.400 --> 43:04.880
<i>♪ Don't speak to me... ♪</i>

43:06.360 --> 43:08.480
Hey! Hey!

43:09.360 --> 43:12.720
Want to give me a hand with this?
Want to give me a hand?

43:13.520 --> 43:15.160
For a second! Give me a hand.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.200
This. Wanna...

43:17.280 --> 43:20.640
come over here... for a second.
Give me a hand.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.760
Gee, thanks.
I'd like to help you, sir,

43:23.840 --> 43:25.920
but I'm too busy
picturing your daughter naked.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.400
Take that out to your father.

43:45.120 --> 43:49.520
(upbeat music playing)

43:50.720 --> 43:52.120
Mom said
I should bring this to you.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.400
Just put it down there.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.600
Hey, give me a hand with this.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.160
Now?

43:58.800 --> 43:59.920
Yeah. Now.

44:00.480 --> 44:03.000
Come up here and,
uh, hold this in place.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.440
You want to use this,
work out some pent-up anger?

44:06.520 --> 44:08.160
You're the one that's angry.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.840
(hitting with hammer)

44:15.960 --> 44:17.520
So, tell me, um...

44:18.840 --> 44:20.120
what'd you get for the tickets?

44:21.160 --> 44:25.440
Altogether, 120,
but, um, I owed this guy $30.

44:25.520 --> 44:27.360
Really? And why is that?

44:28.680 --> 44:31.040
Dad, I can't get into it.
It's too...

44:32.080 --> 44:34.360
stupid and complicated.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.280
So that leaves $90 profit.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.840
Well, you better
declare that as income.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.760
-Declare it to who?
-To me.

44:45.360 --> 44:46.880
You get my point?

44:50.320 --> 44:52.960
So Rayanne said the concert
was really good.

44:53.800 --> 44:56.400
Can I turn this off?
(turns off music)

44:57.400 --> 44:59.400
What do you like
listening to these days?

45:01.040 --> 45:02.840
I don't know. Um...

45:03.880 --> 45:05.560
smashing pumpkins,

45:05.640 --> 45:07.640
rage against the machine,
porno for pyros.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.480
I heard, I love their Christmas
album.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.400
(Angela chuckles)

45:13.800 --> 45:16.680
Stone Temple Pilots.
I like Billie Holiday.

45:16.760 --> 45:19.800
-You like Billie Holiday?
-Yeah.

45:19.880 --> 45:26.360
(upbeat music playing)

45:44.680 --> 45:50.600
(theme music playing)
