WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.250
Okay, everybody. Listen up.

00:04.333 --> 00:05.250
Big announcement.

00:05.333 --> 00:06.583
Maternity leave is over

00:06.667 --> 00:08.417
and I’m headed back to work
at the hospital.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.250
Can you take Toby with you?

00:11.333 --> 00:12.834
Honey, I think we've been over this.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.208
Is that a yes?

00:15.375 --> 00:18.417
All right, you two are gonna take care
of the little ones on Saturday.

00:18.500 --> 00:19.542
Teddy, you get Toby.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.583
Aw, why can't I have Toby?

00:20.667 --> 00:23.250
Remember what happened the last time
I put you in charge of a baby?

00:23.333 --> 00:24.959
Man, you lose one kid.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.333
You get labeled for life.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.333
You and Gabe can take care of Charlie.

00:29.417 --> 00:32.709
What about Dad?
Or don't you trust old butterfingers?

00:32.792 --> 00:35.333
Man. You drop two babies...

00:36.250 --> 00:39.542
I just remembered
i have the Student U.N. on Saturday.

00:39.625 --> 00:40.458
It's at noon.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.583
Oh, that's not a problem.
I only work a half a day.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.959
You know what?
I'll meet you at the high school.

00:44.041 --> 00:44.959
We'll do a Toby hand-off.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.375
Great, then we're all set.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.667
Wow, Mom.

00:47.750 --> 00:48.750
Now that you're going back to work

00:48.834 --> 00:52.000
I guess this is our last
Amy Duncan home-cooked breakfast, huh?

00:52.083 --> 00:53.500
I’m afraid so, honey.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.750
Amy: I know what You're all doing.

Mr. Victor Deleseur.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.291
Two-time winner
of the South High Student U.N.

02:03.375 --> 02:04.208
Three-time.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.208
Hello, Teddy. Why'd you want to see me?

02:07.291 --> 02:08.917
Well...

02:09.000 --> 02:11.834
i was saddened to hear that you
and Victoria broke up.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.458
She said I wasn't romantic enough.

02:14.542 --> 02:16.208
Which is totally untrue.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.083
I did an algorithm which proved
my romanticism is above average.

02:20.709 --> 02:22.000
Anyway, um...

02:22.959 --> 02:25.667
Since you and Victoria
are no longer together--

02:25.750 --> 02:27.083
Uh, stop.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.000
Before you get your hopes up,

02:29.667 --> 02:31.792
I’m not ready to start
another relationship.

02:32.959 --> 02:33.875
It's too soon.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.834
Really? Okay, um...

02:36.917 --> 02:38.667
Give me a moment to regroup...

02:38.750 --> 02:39.750
Done.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.166
Anyways, um...

02:42.250 --> 02:45.291
I was wondering if you
actually wanted to be my partner

02:45.375 --> 02:46.417
for the student U.N.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.750
Ah, so you'd like to win
the award you lose every year.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.291
Well, that's not all of it.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.417
Because the award will look good
on your college applications,

02:53.500 --> 02:54.917
and help you get into a better school.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.709
Yeah. That's all of it.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.917
Amy: Attention, everyone.

03:05.709 --> 03:07.375
I’m back!

03:07.458 --> 03:08.709
Yeah!

03:08.792 --> 03:11.583
Thank you, thank you.

03:11.667 --> 03:12.667
Thank you.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.583
You guys can go pick up that corpse now.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.458
- Oh! Karen.
- Hello, Duncan.

03:18.542 --> 03:20.875
Hi. I thought you gave up nursing

03:20.959 --> 03:22.417
after you got married?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.166
Yeah, well, I’m not married anymore.

03:24.250 --> 03:27.458
He said I was loud and bossy,
I think he has commitment issues.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.959
Well, it's, uh... nice to see you again.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.792
Is it, Duncan? Is it?

03:34.875 --> 03:35.709
Because I remember

03:35.792 --> 03:38.333
what happened the last time
we were in this room together.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.875
Do you?

03:41.208 --> 03:45.417
I believe I resigned
due to a temporary misunderstanding.

03:46.542 --> 03:50.750
You popped one of these saline bags
and squirted it in my face!

03:51.625 --> 03:52.917
Tomato, to-ma-to.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.291
I’m keeping my eye on you, Duncan.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.125
I've had a lot of problems with nurses
returning from maternity leave.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.333
You're not gonna be all like,
"Wah, wah, wah, I miss my baby."

04:06.417 --> 04:07.542
Are you?

04:08.458 --> 04:09.500
Of course not.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.625
Good.

04:13.709 --> 04:15.333
I’m gonna be all, "Wah, wah, wah,

04:15.375 --> 04:17.083
I can’t believe
I have to work with you again."

04:30.792 --> 04:33.000
Now, here is our presentation.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.375
And since we're Italy,

04:34.458 --> 04:38.000
I decided to draw a nice little map
of our nation on the cover.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.959
Oh, good. That's Italy.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.083
I was afraid you were drawing some boots
that you wanted.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.792
Look, I don't draw boots.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.083
I’m not that shallow.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.125
Okay.

04:48.208 --> 04:49.709
All right. Let's go.

04:49.792 --> 04:50.792
Why are you taking the baby?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.542
Don't worry.
My dad's gonna meet me at school,

04:52.625 --> 04:54.959
and we're gonna do a hand-off.
Like in football.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.125
Anyway, it'll be fine.

04:59.208 --> 05:02.709
Toby's such a sweet little boy,
we won't even know he's there.

05:07.125 --> 05:10.834
♪ Hush little baby don't say a word ♪

05:10.917 --> 05:11.875
Why are you singing?

05:11.959 --> 05:13.583
The child is obviously in distress.

05:14.792 --> 05:18.709
♪ Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪

05:18.792 --> 05:22.125
See?

05:22.208 --> 05:24.166
Amazing.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.208
Lullabies were forbidden in my house.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.375
Uh, my mother would only allow me
to listen to 18th century Italian operas.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.000
Oh, so that's why you,
you turned out to be...

05:35.709 --> 05:36.709
The way that you are.

05:42.417 --> 05:45.041
You've been arrested by Sheriff Kitty.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.542
Go to the dog pound.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.667
I don't get it.
The game's called Puppy Town,

05:49.750 --> 05:51.000
but the sheriff's a cat?

05:53.917 --> 05:55.917
Okay. Ah.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.333
You win again, Charlie.

05:57.959 --> 05:59.750
For the tenth straight time.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.125
- Play again?
- No, no, no.

06:02.208 --> 06:03.625
No more Puppy Town. I’m all--

06:03.709 --> 06:04.625
I’m all puppied out.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.375
Uh, let's do something else.

06:06.458 --> 06:07.542
You wanna read a book?

06:08.834 --> 06:10.083
Okay.

06:10.166 --> 06:11.750
"Return to Puppy Town."

06:14.000 --> 06:15.875
Oh, my phone's upstairs. Hang on. Gabe?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.792
Uh, it's your turn to watch Charlie.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.333
Gabe: Just a minute!

06:34.792 --> 06:35.917
What'd you say?

06:38.834 --> 06:40.000
Eh.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.041
Charlie?

06:50.709 --> 06:51.875
Did you run away?

06:53.125 --> 06:54.500
'Cause if you did, I don't blame you.

06:56.458 --> 07:00.083
- Wanna play?
- Oh, Puppy Town, huh?

07:00.166 --> 07:01.792
I used to play with my son Rodney.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.667
I have to warn you, I’m pretty good.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.792
Me too.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.166
Okay, hotshot.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.000
And this is my baby, Toby.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.750
- Isn't he adorable?
- Oh, he's so cute!

07:17.834 --> 07:20.959
Oh, you know what would be adorable?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.875
Doing your job!

07:24.208 --> 07:27.333
You don't see me going around
showing everyone pictures of my plant.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.750
A plant.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.917
How wise of you to get something
that can't run away.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.417
Note to self.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.375
Take picture of plant,
make people look at it.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.458
Okay, I’m just gonna check
your blood pressure, Mr. Franklin.

07:45.542 --> 07:46.792
Oh, you can call me Toby.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.166
Oh, Toby.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.667
That's my baby's name.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.333
Well, what do you know about that.

07:52.417 --> 07:53.875
Today's my first day back at work,

07:53.959 --> 07:55.375
and I just miss him so much.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.750
Oh, Toby.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.333
You're hurting me.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.667
Oh, no, sweetie.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.875
I would never hurt you.

08:04.959 --> 08:05.792
Mama loves you.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.500
Hey, I can’t feel my arm.

08:07.583 --> 08:08.792
What?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.583
I’m sorry.

08:12.667 --> 08:13.709
I’m sorry, Mr. Franklin.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.959
I’m just having a little trouble
focusing today.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.166
That's okay, dear.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.542
You work in a hospital,
No need to focus on your job.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.709
Thank you for understanding.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.750
What you reading?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.667
"Return to Puppy Town."

08:30.500 --> 08:33.166
You know, I can’t get past Sheriff Kitty.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.000
I mean, why would dogs obey a cat?

08:35.083 --> 08:36.208
Thank you.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.250
Okay.

08:40.834 --> 08:44.041
So, where's Charlie?

08:44.125 --> 08:45.208
That's funny.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.709
I'll do it.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.375
So, where's Charlie?

08:50.625 --> 08:52.000
I thought she was with you.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.458
I thought she was with you.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.000
Dude, why are you laughing?

08:57.083 --> 08:58.709
'Cause you're pretending
you don't know where Charlie is.

08:58.792 --> 09:00.166
I don't know where Charlie is!

09:00.250 --> 09:01.208
What?

09:01.291 --> 09:03.208
- This is suddenly not funny.
- You think?

09:03.291 --> 09:04.917
We got to find her. Uh, Charlie?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.375
- Gabe: Charlie?
- Charlie?

09:06.375 --> 09:07.625
Hey, guys.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.542
Hey, Dad.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.917
What are you doing?

09:11.250 --> 09:15.250
Uh... playing hide-and-go-seek
with Charlie.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.792
Yeah. She's very good.

09:16.875 --> 09:20.417
- You wanna help us look?
- She could be anywhere in the house.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.583
Or outside.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.667
- The rules were kinda vague.
- Yeah.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.458
Oh, hey.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.792
Here's an idea.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.667
Why don't you guys go next door
and look in Mrs. Dabney's house.

09:32.208 --> 09:33.333
Do you wanna know why

09:33.417 --> 09:35.083
I think you should go over and look there?

09:35.166 --> 09:36.792
'Cause you're not very good at this game?

09:37.709 --> 09:40.542
No, because Mrs. Dabney
called me an hour ago

09:40.625 --> 09:42.375
to tell me that Charlie
had gone over there.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.834
All by herself.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.375
Oh.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.542
So...

09:49.625 --> 09:52.000
a little moment of panic,
but a happy ending, huh, dad?

09:53.500 --> 09:54.667
Go get her.

09:57.542 --> 10:00.583
Oh, and when you guys come back
we're having a little talk.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.375
Sheriff kitty?

10:10.625 --> 10:12.125
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.750
- Victor.
- Victoria.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.083
This is who you're partnered with?

10:28.375 --> 10:29.625
Victoria: Teddy Duncan?

10:29.709 --> 10:31.542
She's academically inferior.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.583
She's not inferior, she's marginal.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.208
Sitting right here, guys.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.166
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:40.250 --> 10:42.458
I’m going to lead Norway to victory.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.375
Of course she would be Norway.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.667
Cold, isolated, yet irresistible.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.875
Dad, where are you?

10:55.333 --> 10:56.458
What?

10:57.417 --> 10:58.417
Oh, man. Okay.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.667
Yeah, okay. Just get here
as fast as you can.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.750
Okay, bye.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.000
Bad news.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.375
Um, my dad is running late,

11:08.458 --> 11:11.917
so we're kind of stuck with the baby
for a little while.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.375
What? We can't give our presentation
with a baby.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.417
Okay, relax.
No one will even know he's here.

11:16.834 --> 11:18.458
Yeah, unless they have a sense of smell.

11:20.542 --> 11:21.750
Man, Toby.

11:21.834 --> 11:22.917
Again?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.875
All right, let me change you.

11:24.959 --> 11:27.625
Really? Right here?
This is highly inappro--

11:31.959 --> 11:34.291
- Victor, are you okay?
- Victor: Fine.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.542
Just gonna stay down here for a minute.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.542
Probably not a good idea.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.333
Welcome to the 14th annual

11:51.375 --> 11:55.500
South High Student
United Nations competition.

11:56.542 --> 11:58.875
As i always say at this juncture,

11:59.625 --> 12:00.917
Game on.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.583
Yes, the chair recognizes
the delegate from Norway.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.458
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.875
I would like to protest the fact

12:09.959 --> 12:13.709
that the Italian delegation appears
to consist of three people.

12:13.792 --> 12:16.083
The maximum allowed Is two.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.917
Italy, care to rebut?

12:19.542 --> 12:22.375
Um, the third person is a baby.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.959
A baby is a human being.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.250
Italy has admitted to breaking the rules

12:28.333 --> 12:30.208
and should be dismissed
from the proceedings.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.583
Isn't she magnificent?

12:34.291 --> 12:35.333
Mr. Chairman,

12:35.375 --> 12:38.458
Italy is involved
in some family care issues,

12:38.542 --> 12:40.542
Italy's father promised to be here,

12:40.625 --> 12:44.917
But as we can see,
he has failed to cross the border.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.917
The chair understands,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.333
having dealt with Italy's parents before.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.667
Double sixes?

13:00.750 --> 13:02.291
You win again?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.250
Set 'em up. This isn't over.

13:09.959 --> 13:15.166
Well, It only took you 73 minutes
to realize your little sister was missing.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.458
In our defense...

13:17.792 --> 13:19.959
- You got anything?
- Nope.

13:20.041 --> 13:20.917
Oh.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.583
Charlie, there you are.

13:23.834 --> 13:26.333
Oh, playing Puppy Town, huh?

13:26.417 --> 13:27.667
How you doing?

13:27.750 --> 13:28.959
It's about even.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.208
No, it's not.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.083
I let her win.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.208
She said bad words.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.875
Just take her and get out.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.625
Dr. Elliot to ICU.

13:49.709 --> 13:51.667
Dr. Elliot to ICU.

13:51.750 --> 13:55.625
Charlie's voice over PA:
Mommy, I see you. Mommy, I see you.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.417
Charlie?

13:59.417 --> 14:00.917
Charlie, is that you?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.375
Who are you talking to?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.417
Um, no one.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.166
Look, Dr. Napier's looking for you.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.166
Oh, and tomorrow, you're working a double.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.375
Good for you, Karen.

14:11.458 --> 14:12.792
Way to take the reins.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.625
Dr. Napier, you wanted to see me?

14:16.709 --> 14:18.667
Yes, I want you to come home, Mommy.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.792
Uh, excuse me?

14:21.875 --> 14:23.125
I miss you, Mommy.

14:23.917 --> 14:25.291
You do?

14:27.458 --> 14:28.375
Can I have a hug?

14:28.875 --> 14:30.291
Of course, you can.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.792
Ohh.

14:33.041 --> 14:35.208
What are you doing, Duncan?

14:44.458 --> 14:46.417
And that is why Norway believes

14:46.500 --> 14:49.500
that the most important problem
facing the world today is debt.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.333
Thank you.

14:51.417 --> 14:54.959
We will now hear
from the Italian delegation.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.917
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.458
Italy believes the most important issue
facing the world today is the environment.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.000
Just keep going.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.542
As I was saying...

15:11.333 --> 15:13.166
Do something. Make him be quiet.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.834
Only singing will do that.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.333
What are we supposed to do,
sing the presentation?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.375
Italy, we're waiting.

15:19.917 --> 15:21.458
Yeah, that's a great idea. Just sing it.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.125
- But, but, but I...
- Sing.

so let's talk.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.792
How could you two be so irresponsible?

16:25.875 --> 16:27.417
Dad, before we get into that,

16:28.083 --> 16:29.458
we made you a little something.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.125
Oh, sweet mama.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.583
- Is that a chicken bob-pie?
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.208
Stuffed with Cheddar cheese,

16:36.291 --> 16:38.667
mini hot dogs, and onion rings.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.000
And love.

16:44.709 --> 16:46.500
No. No.

16:46.583 --> 16:49.083
Look, guys, bribery is not gonna work.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.959
I’m very disappointed in you two.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.125
Now, I can’t do everything around here.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.667
I was supposed to be over at
the high school to pick up Toby,

16:56.750 --> 16:58.166
but now I gotta deal with this.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.959
We're sorry, dad.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.959
I just can't believe you would let Charlie
walk right out that door.

17:06.917 --> 17:09.208
Dad, we won't let it happen again.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.458
Good.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.625
Now if we're done,

17:12.709 --> 17:14.375
I believe there was a pie mentioned.

17:19.458 --> 17:24.291
And now the exciting moment
that we've all been waiting for,

17:24.375 --> 17:31.083
the winner of the 14th Annual South High
Student U.N. competition is...

17:32.333 --> 17:34.333
Oh, my goodness, Italy.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.834
Yes! We won!

17:37.583 --> 17:38.583
Victor?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.792
I didn’t know you could sing like that.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.208
It was so romantic.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.000
Does this mean you want me back?

17:48.083 --> 17:52.250
- Is 64 the square root of...
- Both: 4,096?

17:52.333 --> 17:53.667
Oh, darling.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.125
Congratulations, Italy.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.250
Wow, um...

18:00.333 --> 18:02.750
you know, I, I’d like
to thank the little people,

18:02.834 --> 18:06.792
and by little people, I mean Toby.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.583
Love you, bro.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.542
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, mom.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.125
What are you doing home
from work so early?

18:17.208 --> 18:18.500
Oh, i had a terrible day.

18:19.166 --> 18:23.333
I kept having these crazy hallucinations
about Toby and Charlie.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.166
In fact, they're still going on.

18:25.250 --> 18:28.375
I thought I just saw Charlie
in Mrs. Dabney's window.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.375
You what? That's crazy.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.000
Mommy!

18:40.125 --> 18:41.542
Does anyone else see her?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.417
She got out again.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.375
Some operation you're running here.

18:50.417 --> 18:51.375
But...

18:51.458 --> 18:53.625
- They lost her first!
- What?

18:53.709 --> 18:55.333
- He ate three pies.
- Yeah!

18:55.417 --> 18:58.417
Well, 'cause you made them for me.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.875
Quiet everybody!

19:01.166 --> 19:03.500
Pie boy, in the kitchen now!

19:05.625 --> 19:07.166
And you two watch your sister.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.250
Honey, honey, honey.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.959
Okay, look. Look, I can explain.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.792
I know it looks bad.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.875
Bob, I missed the kids so much today.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.458
Going back to work
is so much harder than I thought.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.542
Honey, it's just the first day.
It's gonna get better.

19:22.625 --> 19:23.709
I don't know.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.709
Bob, we have two little ones now,

19:26.792 --> 19:28.166
and they both need me so much.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.542
I just-- Look, I know we need the money,

19:31.625 --> 19:34.125
but if there's a way I could stay home--

19:34.208 --> 19:35.750
Okay, all right, all right, we're good.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.333
This is what's best for the family.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.583
Then we'll--

19:38.667 --> 19:39.792
We'll find a way.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.375
Oh, Bob.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.709
Okay.

19:47.041 --> 19:50.125
Guess I’d better go back
to the hospital and quit.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.125
Can't you do that over the phone?

19:52.208 --> 19:53.125
It's Karen.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.834
i should do it In person.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.834
Hello, Karen.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.709
- Is that for a patient?
- Nope.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.291
- You quitting?
- Yup.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.667
Do i have time to put on my goggles?

20:13.750 --> 20:15.792
I recently bought goggles
because I had a feeling.

20:16.792 --> 20:18.583
Nope.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.917
Whoa! Oh! Oh no!

20:22.000 --> 20:23.667
Ohh...

20:27.083 --> 20:28.667
Good for you, Amy.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.000
Good for you.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.083
Well, Charlie,

20:37.166 --> 20:39.542
it looks like Mom's gonna
be staying at home for a while.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.083
And since we got new childproof locks,

20:42.166 --> 20:43.834
we are hoping you will be too.

20:44.709 --> 20:45.542
No, but seriously,

20:45.625 --> 20:47.291
it's gonna be really great
to have Mom at home.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.458
For you, and for Toby...

20:49.542 --> 20:51.792
And yeah, well, for all of us.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.083
Breakfast is ready.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.250
Better give it a minute.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.000
you're gonna be with her
for three meals a day.

21:09.542 --> 21:10.667
