WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.245
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.656 --> 00:03.714
Hayden and Liam are gone.

00:03.984 --> 00:04.859
Hayden!

00:04.884 --> 00:07.174
Hopefully, I'll have more answers
soon. I'll be gone a few days.

00:07.198 --> 00:10.653
Eight years ago, almost an
entire family died in a car accident.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.056
A young girl named Malia
was found.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.092
Somebody out there
murdered an entire family.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.493
That's the first real
bit of information

00:16.517 --> 00:18.362
we've gotten on the
Desert Wolf in months.

00:18.761 --> 00:20.727
It was her. The Desert Wolf.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.404
I guess it's just you and me.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.786
I take it you don't believe the
official story about nuclear radiation?

01:29.190 --> 01:31.156
This is not a nuclear plant.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.726
Do you know what it is?

01:35.729 --> 01:37.629
Or what it was used for?

01:38.732 --> 01:41.834
I know the rumors. Superstition.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.438
What does that say?

01:48.642 --> 01:49.642
"They come."

01:50.611 --> 01:53.090
"They come for all of us."

01:53.114 --> 01:55.447
The men in the masks? Yes.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.251
Like these.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.705
What was the story?

02:08.729 --> 02:11.274
They say they
never took off the mask.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.466
Some people believed
they had no faces underneath.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.436
But they had a symbol.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.706
The snake that eats itself.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.709
The Ouroboros.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.346
Like that one.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.207
What are those?

02:57.444 --> 02:58.477
Failed experiments.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.624
On children?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.781
Fetuses. These were
done in the womb.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.536
Is that a claw? No.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.605
It's a tooth.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.842
I think I found
what I'm looking for.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.879
What is that?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.293
An answer.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.750
We should leave here.
We should leave now.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.422
Easy, Doctor.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.670
I know you have skills,

03:47.694 --> 03:49.894
but I'm pretty sure I can
shoot faster than you can hit.

03:54.802 --> 03:55.867
Do you know who I am?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.540
I know what you're called...

04:03.377 --> 04:04.843
The Desert Wolf.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.424
There's no scent.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.892
No tracks.

05:15.916 --> 05:16.948
No way to find 'em.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.018
But Liam can howl back, right?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.856
Only if he heard me.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.861
I haven't been able
to reach the boys either.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.978
I thought you said, you,
uh, you had a situation.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.614
Yes, but complicated.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.072
If you come in, I need you to
leave your badge at the door.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.042
Uh... Literally or figuratively?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.545
Both would be preferable.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.381
Melissa, I...

05:51.418 --> 05:53.496
I've set my badge aside

05:53.520 --> 05:55.899
a few too many times in
the last couple of weeks.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.567
Well, you may need
to do it a few more

05:57.591 --> 05:59.769
considering what our kids get
into during their free time.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.626
So, do you want
to come in or not?

06:16.643 --> 06:19.122
Has anybody seen Kira tonight?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.879
You don't think
she did this, do you?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.027
Could this have something
to do with Scott?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.451
Some kind of message being sent?

06:37.464 --> 06:39.542
Dispatch,
this is Sheriff Stilinski.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.834
I got a 1-8-7
at 821 Williamson Road.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.137
Notify Beacon Hills Memorial.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.044
There's a dead girl
in your kitchen

06:54.181 --> 06:56.081
with a sword sticking out
of her chest.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.695
What did you think
I was gonna do?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.029
You know it wasn't Kira.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.766
This is murder!

07:02.790 --> 07:06.169
This kid, this child,
has a family.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.959
What, am I supposed
to just cover that up?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.974
This is a crime.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.410
And it's my responsibility
to handle it

07:13.434 --> 07:15.200
within the parameters
of the law.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.449
What about our kids?

07:19.473 --> 07:21.418
They constantly deal with things

07:21.442 --> 07:22.607
outside the law.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.680
But not above the law.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.520
Hi, there.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.977
You doing okay?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.250
Something...
Something happened here.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.200
Cars usually happen here.
Going very fast.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.801
So it might be a good idea
to at least step out

08:11.825 --> 08:13.124
of the middle of the road.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.908
How about I give you
a ride home?

08:16.897 --> 08:18.263
Does that sound
like a good idea?

08:26.573 --> 08:28.213
I think I came here
to remember something.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.887
That's fair.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.822
But considering how late it is,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.524
I'm thinking your parents are
gonna be a little worried about you.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.647
Come on.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.572
What are you doing?

08:49.596 --> 08:51.056
This is Deputy Clark.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.720
I've got the suspect,
I'm bringing her in.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.115
We should get you
to the hospital.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.072
You took in a lot of smoke.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.108
I'm fine.

09:10.733 --> 09:13.263
Suspect in 1-8-7 is in
custody and en route to station.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.754
Suspect's name
is Yukimura, Kira.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.091
What's a 1-8-7?

09:22.596 --> 09:23.762
Homicide.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.216
Her condition worsens.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.386
Stop!

10:22.789 --> 10:24.000
Stop hurting her!

10:24.024 --> 10:25.323
Stop hurting her!

11:03.797 --> 11:06.042
Hello? Where the hell are you?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.976
Home. It's 4:00 in the morning.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.120
Stilinski's calling everyone
in. There's another body.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.004
You mean another murder.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.094
Somebody get these cuffs
off of her.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.031
If she was actually
involved, it was self-defense.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.154
That's correct, Sheriff.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.435
Dad...

11:32.459 --> 11:33.870
Don't say anything.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.205
The sword is mine. Really?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.741
No, it's not. It's mine.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.909
I was attacked in my home.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.079
I grabbed a replica sword from
my collection and defended myself.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.816
And how exactly did the body
end up at the McCall's house?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.252
Apparently,
she wasn't quite dead.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.287
Sheriff,
I have a call into my lawyer.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.289
If you need
to take me into custody,

11:53.313 --> 11:54.746
I'm happy to surrender myself.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.525
This what you're gonna go with?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.198
This is your story?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.922
Are you prepared
to tell a different one?

12:16.369 --> 12:18.369
Hayden?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.473
Hayden, you okay?

12:25.479 --> 12:27.045
It hurts.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.854
Give me your hand.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.963
There's something Scott does.
He can take away the pain.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.800
I've never done
it before, but I can try.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.553
I'm sorry.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.355
Why are they doing this to us?

13:11.792 --> 13:12.924
I don't know.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.056
They're not really gonna
arrest him, are they?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.458
He has to.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.126
My dad basically confessed.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.828
And you don't remember anything?

13:38.852 --> 13:41.553
Nothing.
It was like sleepwalking.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.363
Suddenly I'm just standing
out in the middle of the road.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.203
Okay, we'll figure it out.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.404
What about Liam and Hayden?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.006
We're all meeting at my place

13:50.030 --> 13:51.429
to try to come up
with something.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.477
I don't wanna leave you,
but I...

13:54.501 --> 13:55.567
I've got to find them.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.580
I know.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.003
I wouldn't leave.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.118
My mom's taking me home anyway.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.986
We have to talk to a lawyer.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.977
There's nothing anyone
can do right now.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.213
You should go.

14:11.585 --> 14:12.585
Scott...

14:14.554 --> 14:16.287
You don't think
it was me, do you?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.891
No.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.327
No, of course not.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.306
Hey, is Kira okay?

14:37.611 --> 14:38.877
Scott?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.226
Sorry, I'm only
on chapter two...

14:43.250 --> 14:44.493
I'm kind of a slow reader.

14:44.517 --> 14:45.977
Oh, that's okay, Corey.

14:46.001 --> 14:47.463
He's right. We don't
have time for that anyway.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.487
No, Scott, don't!

15:25.358 --> 15:27.258
It's all right.
I'm sorry, are you okay?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.027
It'll heal.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.129
We'll both heal.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.632
Hayden!

15:35.969 --> 15:37.035
Hayden!

15:38.538 --> 15:39.538
No!

15:40.140 --> 15:42.585
No!

15:42.609 --> 15:43.675
No!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.491
This your official statement?

15:48.515 --> 15:50.943
Something wrong?

15:50.967 --> 15:53.396
The part about finding the
body in your kitchen works fine.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.747
But, then,
it gets a little confusing

15:55.771 --> 15:58.100
when you describe the body
as a monstrous Chimera

15:58.124 --> 16:00.970
and then go on about
werewolves, Banshees, Kanimas...

16:00.994 --> 16:02.060
You're right.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.711
I forgot about
the Dread Doctors.

16:12.038 --> 16:15.017
Sheriff, I got the report in about
the prank call the other night.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.485
The one from the school library.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.109
I was gonna file it
when I saw the names.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.712
Clark, what do you need?

16:21.348 --> 16:22.959
I was...

16:22.983 --> 16:26.362
I checked on the key cards
for the library.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.286
They're for after-hours use...

16:29.255 --> 16:32.335
Uh... Should I come back later?

16:32.359 --> 16:34.737
Why are you telling me
about library key cards?

16:34.761 --> 16:38.107
The system logged two names
right around the time of the 9-1-1 call.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.230
What names?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.165
Theo Raeken...

16:42.602 --> 16:45.269
And your son, Stiles.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.073
Let me see that.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.278
I mean, obviously, Stiles isn't
making prank calls to the station.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.460
I'll deal with it.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.684
No more bending
the rules for anyone.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.555
Maybe you should learn to bend
a little before someone breaks.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.268
Don't get too close.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.609
What is he doing? Tapping
into Corey's memories.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.679
It's usually something
only Alphas do.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.699
Is it as dangerous as it looks?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.322
Probably more.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.706
Does anyone know
if it's working?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.390
No. No!

18:12.692 --> 18:13.692
No. No!

18:24.204 --> 18:25.581
Is he okay?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.849
What the hell did you do to me?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.184
You'll be all right.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.285
There's blood.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.374
You'll heal.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.577
Scott... He'll be fine!

18:33.113 --> 18:35.091
Listen...

18:35.115 --> 18:37.693
I think it worked.
I saw something.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.662
There were tunnels.
Pipes along the walls.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.298
There were these huge blue
pipes at the entrance.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.133
- Two on both sides.
- Wait a second

18:44.157 --> 18:45.701
I know this.
I've seen this before.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.603
That's one of the tunnels
I used to skateboard in.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.272
Remember my dad caught me one
time and told me to never go back?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.536
It's the water treatment plant.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.165
That's where they are.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.467
That's where we'll find
Liam and Hayden.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.611
Hayden?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.580
Hayden, wake up.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.255
Where are we?

19:16.890 --> 19:17.890
I don't know.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.166
Careful.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.605
Sorry, I probably
should've warned you.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.209
Who are you?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.655
My name's Zach.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.679
And I think
the better question is...

19:42.348 --> 19:43.548
What am I?

19:44.617 --> 19:46.851
It's okay. I'm just like you.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.953
One of the experiments.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.924
Hey, maybe you could
help me with something.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.494
The guys, in the masks...

19:57.664 --> 20:00.309
They took something off my back.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.577
I don't know what it was,

20:01.601 --> 20:03.267
but I can feel part of it
still there.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.183
You want us to look?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.207
Is that okay?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.781
Scott...

20:38.805 --> 20:40.783
Scott, slow down. Just
think for a second, okay?

20:40.807 --> 20:41.850
Mason should be going.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.852
Liam's my best friend.
I'm going.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.621
Oh, did you suddenly
get super wolf powers?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.364
I wasn't aware
of that development.

20:47.388 --> 20:49.107
Well, if you're not going,
I could use the help.

20:49.131 --> 20:50.850
No, I'm coming just as
soon as I talk to my dad.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.595
They're moving the body and he wants to
make sure that this time no one steals it.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.896
How's he gonna do that?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.230
I don't know. But whoever
took the last one

20:55.254 --> 20:56.587
was strong enough
to flip my Jeep.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.690
We can bring Theo.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.406
Maybe I better stay here.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.309
You know, in case the Doctors
decide to make a house call for Corey.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.844
Scott, Stiles is right.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.379
We need to slow down and think.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.248
I am thinking...

21:12.272 --> 21:13.515
about how Liam and Hayden
could already be dead.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.384
You could've hurt him, Scott.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.641
Really hurt him.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.712
I have to find Liam.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.261
Hey, text me. For anything.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.328
I got it.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.352
Anything at all. Okay?

22:13.399 --> 22:14.810
Argh! Ugh...

22:14.834 --> 22:16.634
We're not getting out of here.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.683
You could be
a little optimistic.

22:20.707 --> 22:21.750
It's kinda hard when
you watch three people

22:21.774 --> 22:23.574
get dragged out
of here screaming.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.710
What happened to 'em?

22:26.646 --> 22:28.446
They were failures.

22:29.949 --> 22:30.981
That's all they said.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.963
First, you forget.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.521
You don't know who you are
or what you're doing.

22:39.392 --> 22:40.725
Then you get violent.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.864
I watched two of them
almost kill each other.

22:48.935 --> 22:52.948
One of them had
a nasty looking cut

22:52.972 --> 22:54.004
just like that.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.810
Don't worry. Black is okay.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.894
It's only really over when
you start bleeding other stuff.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.718
When it starts turning silver...

23:08.554 --> 23:10.599
Mercury.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.435
That's when they know
you're really a failure.

23:13.459 --> 23:15.471
How many more failures
are there supposed to be?

23:15.495 --> 23:16.605
Who knows?

23:16.629 --> 23:17.906
But doesn't it make you wonder

23:17.930 --> 23:20.909
what the success
is going to look like?

23:20.933 --> 23:23.134
I mean,
what are we turning into?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.737
Something with claws and fangs?

23:27.774 --> 23:29.440
Something with wings?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.843
Something worse.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.885
Liam!

24:15.688 --> 24:17.733
Can you catch a scent?

24:17.757 --> 24:19.023
There's too many chemicals.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.720
Then this might take a while.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.612
You tell me, man.
You're the mechanic.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.848
If the gas tank didn't rupture
and nothing electrical was burned,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.450
then how did the fire start?

24:34.474 --> 24:36.117
Spontaneously combusted?

24:36.141 --> 24:37.786
That's your answer?
Are you kidding?

24:37.810 --> 24:38.854
What are you doing here?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.923
Dad, you gotta leave
the body, okay?

24:40.947 --> 24:42.958
Leave it and let whoever
wants to take it just take it.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.695
Trust me.
I'm doing my job, Stiles.

24:46.719 --> 24:50.165
Yeah, you've been real busy.
Arresting people you know are innocent.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.755
Go home. Now.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.707
This is not up for debate.

24:58.731 --> 24:59.851
Well, then, I'm not leaving.

25:04.504 --> 25:07.071
You know, Clark mentioned
something about, uh,

25:07.907 --> 25:09.106
key cards for the library.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.043
Do you all have
after-hours access?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.058
Yeah. Yeah, we do.
I'd show you mine,

25:16.082 --> 25:18.115
but I lost it
a couple of weeks ago.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.180
I can't help
but notice your frustration.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.616
I'm the only one who still
hasn't finished reading it.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.018
And everything that started
going wrong with me,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.988
started with them.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.758
If it's the language
that's confusing the fox...

25:49.782 --> 25:52.049
Maybe you should stop
trying to understand it.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.954
The story itself
is confusing the fox.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.291
Try not reading the story.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
How do I do that?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.628
Read it backwards.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.306
They're coming.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.277
Oh, God!

26:21.280 --> 26:23.981
No, no, no, no.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.131
No!

26:29.155 --> 26:30.287
No! Stop!

26:31.624 --> 26:32.690
Help me!

26:33.259 --> 26:34.703
Help me!

26:34.727 --> 26:37.061
No! No! Wait!

26:38.164 --> 26:40.598
No! Help me!

26:49.008 --> 26:50.207
Hayden!

26:50.876 --> 26:51.942
Liam!

26:52.311 --> 26:53.777
Liam!

26:54.847 --> 26:56.246
Hayden!

26:58.784 --> 26:59.950
Anything? Nothing.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.053
Hayden!

27:05.958 --> 27:08.518
Okay, We need to make sure that
we're not covering the same area.

27:11.364 --> 27:12.696
You need your inhaler,
don't you?

27:14.133 --> 27:15.877
Quiet.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.813
I think I hear something.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.770
It's just the lights, isn't it?

27:24.744 --> 27:26.210
Come on. This way.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.347
It healed, didn't it?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.161
Yeah. Completely.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.864
Okay, then. It's been fun.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.933
Especially the part where
a werewolf forced his way

27:37.957 --> 27:40.335
into my brain with his claws.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.404
I don't think leaving is
such a good idea, Corey.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.306
You know, Lydia's a Banshee.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.341
It means she can tell when
someone's close to death.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.732
Lydia, what happens if
he walks out that door?

27:50.036 --> 27:51.168
It's bad.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.650
Very bad.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.284
I'll take my chances.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.348
Then give us a better chance
at finding our friends.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.656
What else did you see?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.520
Come on, Corey, there had
to be something else.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.884
There was the hospital and...

28:07.753 --> 28:09.064
they took me outta my room.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.432
And then where?

28:10.456 --> 28:12.000
The tunnels.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.136
Like I already told you.
That's it.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.437
Yeah, nothing after that?

28:15.461 --> 28:16.871
No.

28:16.895 --> 28:18.306
Well, there has
to be more. Think.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.264
Corey, for one minute,
just... just think.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.210
There was a basement.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.447
Where? Like, in a building?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.148
A house.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.464
It was old, covered in
dust and...

28:42.488 --> 28:45.233
There was a broken stone wall
with a large hole in it.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.335
Like a bomb went off.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.938
Lydia, the werewolf
with the talons...

28:49.962 --> 28:51.873
The one who attacked Scott.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.743
Didn't Parrish say that he smashed
through the wall of a basement?

28:54.767 --> 28:55.967
Wasn't it something like that?

28:56.435 --> 28:57.435
No.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.503
It was exactly that.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.231
Authorities
are still trying to move

29:16.255 --> 29:17.999
the overturned tractor trailer,

29:18.023 --> 29:19.968
so if you're anywhere near 115

29:19.992 --> 29:22.270
you might wanna try
an alternate route.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.861
Service streets
are still jammed...

30:33.232 --> 30:34.843
Downstairs, check in.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.333
Nothing yet, Sheriff.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.992
Clark, you want to check
and see if something going on

30:51.016 --> 30:53.210
with the air conditioning
down here?

30:53.234 --> 30:55.714
I'm pretty sure a morgue is
supposed be a lot cooler than this.

31:18.878 --> 31:19.977
Watch out!

31:24.350 --> 31:26.416
Get back!
Everybody, back! Get back!

31:46.438 --> 31:50.474
Clark? Parrish? Clark?

31:59.385 --> 32:02.019
I'm telling you guys, we've
been down this one before.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.567
What the hell are we doing?

32:05.591 --> 32:07.031
We're running up
and down this place.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.637
Up and down tunnels.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.205
And there's no way...

32:10.229 --> 32:12.062
There's no way
that we're gonna find...

32:15.334 --> 32:16.494
Scott, you need your inhaler.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.571
Scott, use it. Use your inhaler.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.324
This is all my fault.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.241
We're never going to find them.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.531
It's my fault.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.368
Scott.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.161
We should keep looking.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.451
We should keep trying.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.440
They're coming back.

33:44.323 --> 33:47.635
Liam? Hayden?

33:47.659 --> 33:49.026
Theo, wait... Don't!

33:58.337 --> 34:01.371
Theo? Theo?

34:02.307 --> 34:03.640
Theo, you all right?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.209
Yeah.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.112
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.553
You think you can get help?

34:17.422 --> 34:18.655
I am the help.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.688
Sheriff.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.635
Parrish, what the hell
is going on?

34:53.659 --> 34:54.724
I think I saw the suspect.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.594
Dad? Dad!

34:58.297 --> 34:59.596
Go get your son, Sheriff.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.799
Dad!

35:03.135 --> 35:04.701
Dad, the body.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.504
It still hurts?

35:29.528 --> 35:31.595
Everywhere. I'm not healing.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.630
Not like it did before.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.667
That means I'm a failure,
doesn't it?

35:55.487 --> 35:58.588
It's gone. The pain's gone.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.226
How did you do that?

36:06.899 --> 36:08.298
I don't know.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.471
It was the night
of the traffic jam.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.662
I don't know what they did,
but they did something.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.665
Then it's not your fault.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.613
We still need to fix it.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.237
And I don't think
the solution is here.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.708
What about your dad?

37:26.778 --> 37:29.346
There's no body.
They had to let him go.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.995
Kira, I don't want you to leave.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.364
And I don't want to hurt anyone.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.654
Especially you.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.236
You're not going to hurt anyone.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.327
Scott, look at me.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.342
Look at me with your other eyes

37:47.366 --> 37:48.465
and tell me what you see.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.633
Sweetheart, everything okay?

39:34.139 --> 39:35.572
Something's changed.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.841
What do you mean?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.744
I'm not sure.

39:43.849 --> 39:47.462
Something's different.
With me and my friends.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.696
With all of us.

39:48.720 --> 39:49.853
Something's changed.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.493
I think it's because of me.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.667
And I don't know how to fix it.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.716
Oh, hey.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.839
Hey.

40:18.183 --> 40:21.117
It's him. He's the one
taking the bodies.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.992
Then I think I know
where he's taking them.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.940
I heard
an interesting rumor, Doctor.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.446
I heard that my daughter
is still alive.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.917
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.719
A daughter?

40:58.790 --> 41:01.057
I don't know anything
about a daughter.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.573
Well, I hope you're
telling the truth.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.609
Because if she is still alive,

41:08.633 --> 41:10.567
I'm just going to
have to kill her again.
