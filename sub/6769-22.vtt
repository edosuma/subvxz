WEBVTT

00:16.641 --> 00:18.768
Matt Durning.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.770
{\an5}KELLY:
I know you're busy,
but I just wanted

00:20.854 --> 00:22.689
to call and say "hi." Hi.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.401
I'm vacuuming.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.861
Well, a clean carpet
is important.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.780
But why don't you hire
somebody to do that,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.365
so you can hang out with me?

00:32.448 --> 00:33.950
Which is also important.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.910
Well, actually, I've been
avoiding a research memo.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.245
Okay.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.955
(clears throat)

00:39.038 --> 00:41.416
{\an1}Um, honey,
hold on one second.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.752
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.128
What are you doing here?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.797
{\an3}Actually I'm, uh,
servicing a bowl of cereal.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.340
{\an3}It's in dire need
of some milk, so...

00:49.424 --> 00:51.926
Oh, a tragic tale.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.344
{\an3}I want to talk to you
about something.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.847
{\an3}Okay? So, stick
around, okay?

00:59.058 --> 01:01.019
So, sorry.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.937
Uh, it's a no go, huh?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.313
Next time, I promise.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.482
What are you doing later?

01:05.565 --> 01:08.318
Uh, just some errands and stuff.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.820
I'll stop by in a few hours?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.697
Okay, sounds good.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.957
That year, I had sex
with every best actor nominee.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.834
And few supporting, as well.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.878
I made up my own little
Special Effects Award,

01:26.961 --> 01:28.171
if you know what I mean.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.841
But times have changed

01:31.925 --> 01:33.468
and so have I.

01:33.551 --> 01:34.803
My involvement here
with all of you

01:34.886 --> 01:36.054
has really made the difference.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.847
Okay, so...

01:37.931 --> 01:39.557
do we have any newcomers
here this morning?

01:41.976 --> 01:44.395
Yes?

01:44.479 --> 01:46.481
Hi, everybody.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.899
I'm Steve.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.193
I'm addicted to sex.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.111
ALL:
Hi, Steve.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.699
KELLY:
<i>Okay.</i>

01:56.783 --> 01:59.327
{\an5}So, what did you
want to talk about?
Nothing.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.912
I lied.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.665
See, I figured running into you
was the best thing that's

02:03.748 --> 02:06.251
gonna happen to me today, so
I didn't want you to slip away.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.545
{\an3}I'm not avoiding you,
if that's what you think.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.381
We never see each other, Kel.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.384
{\an3}No, no, Matt and I were
at the After Dark last night.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.552
That's not what I mean.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.887
I mean you and me alone.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.889
Yeah, that's not a good idea.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.349
Why is that?
Because friends aren't

02:21.432 --> 02:22.725
supposed to want
to sleep together?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.769
{\an1}And we don't.
We don't want to?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.729
Or we just don't?

02:26.813 --> 02:28.731
{\an1}I mean,
you were just talking

02:28.815 --> 02:30.066
to Matt on the phone right now

02:30.149 --> 02:31.693
and you didn't
tell him about me.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.570
It just didn't come up.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.742
Well, for future reference,

02:39.826 --> 02:42.078
drinking coffee is not a crime.

02:42.161 --> 02:44.455
Give me your purse.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.207
{\an1}Give me your purse, now!
Mommy!

02:46.291 --> 02:48.585
Don't hurt him, please!
Give me your purse.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.586
Please! Please, don't hurt him!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.629
{\an3}Just let him go!
Mommy!

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
{\an1}Come right over here.
Are you okay?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.095
(labored breathing)

02:59.178 --> 03:00.430
{\an1}Oh.
Are you okay?

03:00.513 --> 03:01.764
I just need to sit.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.766
Mommy, are you sick?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.018
I'm fine, honey.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.937
I'm not due
for another month,

03:08.021 --> 03:09.772
but I think it's time.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.107
"Time"?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.984
Time!
Mm-hmm.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.695
Okay.
Okay, uh, do some breathing.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.655
{\an4}And, um, I'll just--
I'm gonna go and I'll
Okay.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.240
come right back and I'll take
you to the hospital.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.701
Okay? Just stay right...

03:24.704 --> 03:27.498
{\an3}Okay, listen, I'm going
to take her to L.A. Memorial.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.751
{\an5}Are you okay?
Yeah, son of a bitch
broke my helmet.

03:29.834 --> 03:30.793
Well, did he get away?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.253
Nope, he's right in here.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.255
{\an1}Can't make up his mind:
paper or plastic.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.925
MAN (screaming):
Let me out of here!

03:37.008 --> 03:39.677
I'm claustrophobic, bro!

03:39.761 --> 03:41.095
It's not my problem!
Shut up!

03:41.179 --> 03:42.472
(banging)

03:42.555 --> 03:44.265
Oh, wait.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.642
Let me out of here!

03:45.725 --> 03:47.101

03:47.185 --> 03:49.687

04:16.089 --> 04:18.382
♪ ♪

04:20.218 --> 04:22.095

04:29.060 --> 04:30.061

05:22.613 --> 05:24.115
Ooh, it's all right, sweetie.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.451
The nurse will take you to
the playroom for a few minutes.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.411
{\an5}I called your husband.
He's on his way.
Oh, thank you.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.997
Good luck, okay?
Breathe.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.750
Listen, I'm going to be
a little late.

05:33.833 --> 05:34.751
Something's come up.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.335
GINA:
<i>I have great news.</i>

05:36.419 --> 05:37.879
A job offer.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.255
That's, that's great.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.215
I'll, I'll call you
when I can get away.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.675
Oh. Away from what?

05:42.759 --> 05:45.595
Look, I, I got to go.
I'll see you later.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.721
Dylan, but wait.
I want...

05:46.804 --> 05:48.306
Hello?

05:48.389 --> 05:49.932
(mouthing):
Perfect.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.559
{\an3}Hi.
Hi.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.103
I'm Jason Chang of the
<i>Tribune's</i> "Metro" section.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.606
{\an6}Oh, hello.
That was a great
thing you did today.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.441
Oh, thank you.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.358
Kelly Taylor.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.736
Did you say the <i> L.A. Tribune?</i>
Mm-hmm.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.321
{\an3}You know that mugger
your friend bagged

06:03.404 --> 06:04.447
has a long rap sheet.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.407
{\an3}You got a bad guy,
a pregnant mom,

06:06.491 --> 06:07.408
couple of Good Samaritans.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.452
It's a reporter's dream.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.620
{\an3}I'd like to know
everything.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.830
{\an5}Where you were?
What you were doing?
Uh, we were

06:12.914 --> 06:15.583
{\an3}um, just having coffee.
Who's "we"?

06:15.666 --> 06:18.628
You and your boyfriend?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.837
{\an1}Oh, um...

06:19.921 --> 06:22.465
This really isn't
necessary, is it?

06:22.548 --> 06:24.509
{\an3}We'll only mention
your names in the lead in

06:24.592 --> 06:25.635
and the photo caption.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.554
{\an3}In this case, there is no
such thing as bad publicity.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.308
I don't know about that.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.310
So, what's his name?

06:34.393 --> 06:35.603
Um...

06:35.686 --> 06:36.687
(mouthing):
No.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.233
Steve Sanders.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.283
Hey! Did David stop by?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.493
He was supposed
to pick up those

06:50.576 --> 06:52.495
on-air promos he's doing for us.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.830
Did he talk to you?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.581
{\an1}You were supposed
to write them, right?

06:57.166 --> 06:58.918
Janet, is everything okay?

07:01.587 --> 07:03.172
(on machine):
Steve, it's Katie.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.466
Thank you for being so open
at our meeting this morning.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.051
You know, afterwards, I got...
This is nothing.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.052
a chance to chat with Kenny.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.178
Wait. Listen.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.304
Kenny's a compulsive

07:10.388 --> 07:11.305
masturbator like you are.
(laughing)

07:11.389 --> 07:13.683
After he heard you talk, well,
This is nothing.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.518
suddenly, he didn't feel
so alone.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.019
Oh, I got your message.

07:17.103 --> 07:17.895
Lunch today sounds good.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.523
So I will see you later.
(machine beeps)

07:21.482 --> 07:22.900
This was a hunch.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.027
It turned out
to be a gold mine.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.571
The Beverly Hills meeting

07:26.654 --> 07:28.489
of Sexual Dependents Anonymous.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.866
(chuckles)

07:29.949 --> 07:33.161
And what exactly
were you mining for?

07:33.244 --> 07:34.162
Stories for the paper.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.121
Now, there were no
celebrities in attendance.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.498
However, this girl, Katie,
happens to have

07:37.582 --> 07:39.417
a play-by-play.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.502
She also happens to be
my sponsor,

07:41.586 --> 07:44.380
so she and I will share intimate
details of our experiences.

07:44.463 --> 07:45.381
{\an1}Perversion.
No.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.674
Genius!

07:46.757 --> 07:49.427
{\an1}(cackles)

07:49.510 --> 07:50.553
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
{\an1}I'm parked in a red zone,
so I don't have a lot of time.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.223
What's with that hair,
Eddie Munster?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.600
Thanks, Steve.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.561
Uh, can I get the ad copy,
please?

07:58.644 --> 08:00.563
{\an5}Oh, yeah, give me 20 minutes.
I'll put it together.
Here.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.940
{\an3}Steve's had
a tight schedule.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.401
{\an6}Oh, do you want to share
with David your problem?
No, no.

08:05.484 --> 08:06.736
{\an3}You know, about the,
uh, compulsive...

08:06.819 --> 08:09.864
{\an1}No! No, look.
It's, it's gonna be great.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.407
{\an1}You're gonna be
very proud of me.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.075
Come on, Steve.
Share with me.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.744
I don't think so.
Please?

08:14.827 --> 08:16.204
Hi, Steve.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.496
Hi. I'm Katie.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.583
I'm brimming with pride.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.752
{\an1}Janet.
David.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.587
Hi.
Hi.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.048
This is my lunch date.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.507
I'll see you later.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.095
Shall we?

08:35.681 --> 08:36.974
Who is she?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.934
That's an alarming
new friend of Steve's.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.394
Charming.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.606
You said "alarming."

08:43.688 --> 08:44.607
Yeah.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.806
{\an3}Hey.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.975
{\an3}Hey.
New hangout?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.601
What are you doing here?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.145
{\an3}Oh, fabric's 40%
cheaper down here.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.439
Merino wool, feel.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.608
It's definitely wool.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.484
What's the matter?

09:28.567 --> 09:30.987
Nothing. Everything's cool.

09:34.573 --> 09:37.576
Hmm, well, is the menu
any good here?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.661
Um, I couldn't tell you.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.162
It's my first time here.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.497
The coffee's not bad though.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.672
Do you want me to leave you
alone or something?

09:49.755 --> 09:51.173
'Cause I'm feeling weird.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.509
I saw you and I was
happy to see you...

09:53.592 --> 09:54.635
No, I'm happy to see you, too.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.637
Okay.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.472
Let's get out of here.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.975
Sure.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.359
Noah, where are you going?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.695
I think Sal finally made these
the way you like them.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.700
{\an1}Donna...
No, just go eat your eggs.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.287
So, uh...

10:21.370 --> 10:23.706
Do you want
to take these to go?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.513
{\an1}Hey! Am I
interrupting?

10:39.597 --> 10:41.057
No. Please, interrupt.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.517
Oh, good. I'm here business.
Um, official business.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.519
Legal business.
Really? What's up?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.438
You don't watch
the Skating Channel do you?

10:47.521 --> 10:50.399
I've, I've flipped by, yeah.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.068
They offered me a job!

10:52.151 --> 10:53.569
Congratulations.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.029
Color commentary,
it's the regionals

10:55.112 --> 10:57.698
of the World Figure Skating
Championships.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.450
Kitty Shavers?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.119
Her contract is up and they're
looking for some new blood.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.704
And you want me
to negotiate your contract.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.039
Oh, no, there's nothing
to negotiate.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.540
It's just that they called me up
and they said

11:06.624 --> 11:08.084
"Who's your lawyer?"
and I didn't want to seem,

11:08.167 --> 11:09.960
{\an3}you know, unprofessional.
Okay, well.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.962
Um, here.
Here's my card.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.547
The fax number's on it.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.801
{\an4}And, uh, can I take
a look at their offer?
Oh, yeah.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.473
I'll take it.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.101
{\an3}Well, see, Gina, a first bid
is always a lowball offer.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.561
{\an3}They don't really expect you
to jump on it, you know?

11:27.645 --> 11:30.606
{\an1}No, see this is a real job.
It's a big break for me.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.108
Oh, yeah, I mean, Gina,

11:32.191 --> 11:33.943
{\an3}you got the break,
they made you an offer,

11:34.026 --> 11:36.570
but you were a national
finalist, you know what I mean?

11:36.654 --> 11:38.572
Yes, and now my job is
to go to people's homes

11:38.656 --> 11:40.783
and teach then the correct way
to do sit-ups.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.076
Listen to me, okay,

11:42.159 --> 11:44.453
do you know how many executives
have to approve this offer, huh?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.123
{\an3}It is done,
they picked you.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.124
Yeah?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.291
Yeah.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.794
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:51.877 --> 11:52.753
{\an3}All right.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.464
{\an1}Okay, well, go ahead
and do your lawyer stuff

11:55.548 --> 11:57.133
{\an1}or whatever, but do
it really fast, okay?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.801
Okay, all right.
See you later.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.933
So when I whacked this guy
in the head,

12:06.016 --> 12:07.518
he broke the face mask
on my helmet

12:07.601 --> 12:09.812
{\an3}which made me mad and
I put him in the trunk.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.647
{\an1}Yeah.
You threw him in the trunk?

12:11.730 --> 12:13.482
How Jackie Chan of you.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.776
How come I never get
to be the hero?

12:17.027 --> 12:18.154
What happened to the woman?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.281
So she goes into labor

12:20.364 --> 12:21.365
{\an3}and we all go
to the hospital

12:21.449 --> 12:23.159
and she has the baby.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.493
She's doing fine.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.995
{\an3}He's a little early,
but healthy.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
I go to make a phone call.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.372
when I come back Kelly
is surrounded

12:28.456 --> 12:29.832
by reporters
and policemen

12:29.915 --> 12:31.500
{\an3}who need
to file a report.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.668
Yeah, so then what happened?

12:32.751 --> 12:35.171
I might not have done
the right thing.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.381
What? What?

12:37.465 --> 12:41.635
{\an5}Nobody ever actually
saw me at the scene.
Yeah.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.179
So?

12:43.262 --> 12:46.557
So I told them I was with you.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.350
You saved the day.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.686
Wait a second, with me? Why?

12:50.769 --> 12:53.981
{\an5}Because there were TV
cameras at the hospital.
Yeah.

12:54.064 --> 12:54.815
Look, Steve,

12:54.899 --> 12:57.359
we just didn't want
Gina and Matt

12:57.443 --> 12:59.153
to be wondering
why we were hanging out.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.696
{\an6}KELLY:
We were just
having coffee.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.698
{\an6}Yeah, decaf.
It wasn't like it was
some clandestine

13:02.781 --> 13:03.782
meeting or anything.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.117
Well, it is now.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.953
That's not
like you to lie, Kelly.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.498
So what really happened?

13:10.581 --> 13:11.499
Nothing.
Talking.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.541
Talking.
Nothing.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.876
Oh, boy.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.211
{\an3}KELLY:
Gina's already jealous

13:15.294 --> 13:18.589
and I sort of made
a promise to her

13:18.672 --> 13:20.716
that I would stay away from him.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.718
Way to keep a promise.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.428
{\an4}Yeah.
DYLAN:
The thing is, Steve,

13:24.512 --> 13:27.848
right now the <i> Tribune</i>
they need your-your picture.

13:27.932 --> 13:28.849
My picture?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.059
For a feature.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.852
And the mayor's office
would like to know

13:31.936 --> 13:33.771
how to contact you to thank you.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.564
(laughing)

13:35.648 --> 13:38.609
And see the media they need
a-a like hero right now.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.402
And we just need a big favor.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.071
I don't think so.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.865
(phone ringing)

13:44.949 --> 13:48.244
<i>Beverly Beat,</i>
this is Steve Sanders.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.538
Courageous?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.958
Not quite.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.918
A Gary Cooper for our times?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.045
{\an1}Can you hold on
a second?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
How many times did I hit him?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.510
Uh, once.
Once.

14:06.011 --> 14:06.929
Once.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.891
It was a, a big
left-hand hook.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.062
(rock music playing)

14:16.522 --> 14:19.733
Hey, I was looking
for you all day.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.236
{\an3}With or without
the waitress?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.779
Would you sit
down, please.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.741
{\an3}The club's packed
and I'm shorthanded.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.993
{\an3}Can we talk
about this later?

14:29.076 --> 14:32.162
Would we even be talking about
this if I hadn't run into you?

14:32.246 --> 14:33.581
How long have you
been seeing her?

14:33.664 --> 14:34.999
I'll tell you as much

14:35.082 --> 14:36.166
{\an3}as I understand
myself, okay?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.251
Her name is Rene.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.254
I hate sentences that
begin with "her name is."

14:40.337 --> 14:42.840
And, yes, I've been going to see
her the last couple weeks.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.675
When are you gonna
get to the part

14:44.758 --> 14:46.302
that's going to make me
feel better here?

14:46.385 --> 14:47.803
I can't tell you
everything right now.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.972
{\an3}But I'm not
involved with her.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.058
Except for the fact
that she's my sister.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.158
Well, when he picked up
the kid,

15:09.241 --> 15:11.285
that's where he crossed
the line with me.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.954
I knew then it was
going to get ugly.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.165
I didn't know you had it in you.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.458
{\an5}WOMAN:
In addition to receiving...
I knew.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.001
the Highly Regarded
Citizen's Award,

15:19.084 --> 15:20.836
Steve will receive tickets
to several Dodger home games,

15:20.919 --> 15:26.300
and 100 pounds of sausage
from Raffi's of Beverly Hills.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.637
Oh, yeah, if you guys want
sausage, you come see me.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.305
It's often said
that what this town needs

15:31.388 --> 15:32.973
is a hero.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.142
The Michaels family found
one in Steve Sanders.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.311
Why didn't you tell me
about this yesterday?

15:37.394 --> 15:40.147
{\an3}Well, you know me--
I don't like to brag.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.191
{\an3}Okay, enough of this.
We all have things to do,

15:42.274 --> 15:43.525
places to go,

15:43.609 --> 15:45.194
{\an3}people to save right?
Yep.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.404
He is so cute.
Thanks, honey.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.242
{\an1}Well, you two
make quite a team.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.994
Oh, it was all Steve.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.497
Oh, I beg to differ.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.249
{\an1}But when did you two
meet up yesterday?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.085
{\an1}I thought you were
running errands.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.046
{\an3}Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, my car
was acting funny, so...

16:04.129 --> 16:05.547
Yeah, it was smoking
a little bit.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.383
A little oil leak
on the exhaust manifold,

16:07.466 --> 16:09.218
{\an3}so I just tightened up
her valve covers, that all.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.221
{\an4}It's okay?
It's fine.
It's fine.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.222
{\an1}You sure?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.766
Yes, I'm sure.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.892
All right.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.061
Um, are you coming
with me or...?

16:19.144 --> 16:22.064
Oh, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna
stay with Steve for awhile.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.065
All right.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.900
{\an3}See ya, man.
See ya.

16:24.983 --> 16:26.235
Bye-bye.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.445
Hi.
Bye.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.697
Um, hero's thataway.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.491
{\an1}Flowers humbly accepted.
Oh.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.119
These ain't for you.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.207
Hey.
Hey.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.375
Hi.
Hey.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.085
These are for you.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.254
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.965
And I would love to hear
all about your sister.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.009
All right, um, okay.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.845
She's my half-sister,

16:52.928 --> 16:55.347
{\an1}and, look, I don't,
I don't blame you

16:55.431 --> 16:57.015
for being upset with me, okay?

16:57.099 --> 16:59.101
{\an3}I just-- I have
so many questions.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.102
Does your mom know?

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
She doesn't have a clue.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.731
{\an3}Are you going to tell her?
I don't think so.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.275
{\an1}Look, my dad's personal
estate was settled

17:06.358 --> 17:07.608
a few months ago

17:07.693 --> 17:09.444
and his lawyer came
to me and said,

17:09.528 --> 17:11.070
"I want you to clear out
his desk."

17:11.155 --> 17:12.740
And I did and I found
some pictures

17:12.823 --> 17:14.907
and some returned checks,
stuff like that.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.077
Then his legal advisors pretty
much explained the rest.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.787
So he had an affair.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.829
He had a second life.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.749
I mean, hopefully, it was better
than his first.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.751
Do you know if he was
in love with her mother

17:23.834 --> 17:26.127
{\an6}or did they spend a
lot of time together?
I don't know.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.838
Was Rene close with your dad?

17:27.921 --> 17:29.339
I don't think
she knows who he is.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.175
So what does she say?
Rene?

17:32.176 --> 17:33.135
"How do you like your eggs?"

17:33.218 --> 17:35.763
Are you telling me
she doesn't know who you are?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.097
Look, my father's gone.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.599
I can't bring him back, okay?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.808
{\an1}But there's this
little part of him left.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.936
I just want to see what she
looks like and how she acts.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.147
I'm not looking for
hugs and kisses here.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.149
Yeah, but she's your family.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.568
That's her bad luck.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.701
Well, it sounds like you have
some issues with intimacy.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.037
Here you go.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.498
Meal is on the house.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.876
We have a no-charge policy
for crime fighters.

18:05.959 --> 18:09.213
(chuckles)

18:09.296 --> 18:11.006
And please don't take this
the wrong way,

18:11.089 --> 18:12.674
but maybe a spiritual void.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.967
I'm working on that.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.095
{\an1}But, I mean, I think
you've come a long way.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.971
Some people can't even
get through an hour

18:18.055 --> 18:19.014
without acting out.

18:19.097 --> 18:21.642
I was inspired when you
shared with the group.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.936
It was pretty bad for a while.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.020
How bad?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.899
I mean, well, that story
about the premiere.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.901
That was moving.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.695
You really had
a thing for actors.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.155
Politicians, too.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.032
Really?

18:37.115 --> 18:38.867
Steve, you're enjoying this
a little too much.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.662
You might as well be reading
a dirty magazine.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.038
No. This is way better.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.498
I won't indulge your addiction.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.041
It's not helping
either one of us.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.711
Katie, I'm
in the newspaper business.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.672
The tabloid newspaper business,
to be exact.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.006
And these stories,

18:53.090 --> 18:55.050
well, they're really great.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
Steve, don't even ask me

18:56.468 --> 18:58.011
what you're gonna ask me.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.179
I wouldn't use your name.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.723
That group is a lifeline.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.853
{\an1}You publicize membership
and you'll destroy it.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.563
Steve, I saw you on TV.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.564
You're a hero.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.067
Now act like one.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.235
Hey, guys.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.362
Hi. David-- I think
we met yesterday.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.281
Hi. Yeah, I remember you.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.951
I'm not interrupting
anything here, am I?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.911
{\an1}No.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.371
We're done.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.172
Oh, man, I'm starting to trip
on my superhero cape.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.423
I'm starting to hate this.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.091
She is beautiful.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.759
{\an1}There's something
about her--

19:37.843 --> 19:38.927
she's very...

19:39.011 --> 19:40.596
Sexual?

19:40.679 --> 19:41.889
You know, that
could work against you.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.224
Yeah, right.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.564
{\an5}MATT:
<i>So anyway, I looked</i>
<i>over their offer,</i>

19:50.647 --> 19:54.234
and if they want you as
much as I think they do,

19:54.318 --> 19:55.736
we can get more money.

19:55.819 --> 19:56.778
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.447
They paid Kitty Shavers

19:58.530 --> 20:00.782
{\an4}twice the amount last year.
Yeah, that's because
she's a name,

20:00.866 --> 20:01.950
but she stinks as a skater.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.078
{\an6}Well, you ready to play
a little hardball?
Mm-hmm.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.623
{\an1}You're not going to ask
for too much, right?

20:07.706 --> 20:08.665
Only what you deserve.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.791
Good.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.837
And how do you know
how much that is?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.756
You know. You just have to.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.466
Or you won't know
when to walk away.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.636
Right. When is that?
When you're being undervalued.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.304
If you don't think you're worth
more, you won't get it.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.972
That's right.
Same is true in life.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.098
Same is true
in life.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.391
WOMAN:
Business affairs.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.935
Yes Matt Durning
for Cyril Rycoff.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.895
Please hold.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.689
RYCOFF:
Hello.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.983
Yes, Mr. Rycoff.
I'm representing Miss Kincaid.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.860
Okay, how'd you like to proceed?

20:36.944 --> 20:37.861
Well, we've gone over

20:37.945 --> 20:39.988
your offer sheet

20:40.072 --> 20:42.950
and we're proceeded to line
my birdcage with it.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.994
Ooh, this is fun.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.288
I like that-- curveball.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.456
See ya.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.540
See ya.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.674
{\an1}"Within seconds,
Mr. Sanders had run up

20:58.757 --> 20:59.925
{\an1}"and bagged
the convicted felon

21:00.008 --> 21:02.052
{\an1}like the sack
of groceries he..."

21:02.135 --> 21:03.470
"Soon became intimate with

21:03.553 --> 21:07.015
in the trunk
of Mrs. Michaels' car."

21:07.099 --> 21:08.809
How embarrassing.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.018
Okay, here's the best part.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.687
About the mom.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.647
"The Michaels family welcomed
its newest member,

21:13.730 --> 21:15.023
"a six-pound, three-ounce

21:15.107 --> 21:18.068
baby boy named... Steve."

21:18.151 --> 21:19.361
{\an1}Aw...
Oh, come on--.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.321
You love all this attention.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.198
Janet, it's just... not me.

21:23.281 --> 21:24.366
What, brave?

21:24.449 --> 21:25.909
Humane? Selfless?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.202
Yeah, all that stuff.

21:27.285 --> 21:30.038
Yeah, all that stuff, that stuff
that I just knew you could be.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.540
Huh.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.000
What is wrong with you?

21:33.083 --> 21:37.212
{\an3}You know what, I need
to get back to the office.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.047
You're going to work-- now?

21:39.131 --> 21:42.050
{\an1}Yeah, there's a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.011
Well, do you want me
to go with you?

21:44.094 --> 21:48.098
No, no, I will, uh,
I'll see you later.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.522
{\an5}DYLAN:
All right this looks
pretty done.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.941
Oh, Chef Dylan McKay.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.443
(humming tune)

21:59.526 --> 22:01.028
Hey, hey, look out.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.070
{\an3}What?

22:02.154 --> 22:03.447
Listen, don't do that.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.699
{\an1}I-I'm supposed to be
cooking for you here, okay?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.284
It's done.
I know, but--

22:07.367 --> 22:08.869
{\an3}You do the pasta,
I do the salad.

22:08.952 --> 22:10.620
{\an6}Mm-mmm. Here's
what we'll do.
No.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.372
I'll take you over here. Mm-hmm.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.915
{\an3}And we'll work on
the main course

22:13.999 --> 22:16.418
{\an3}and then later, we'll
get to the salad, okay?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.253
That's very European.
Mm-hmm.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.048
{\an1}Wait. Why are you being
so nice to me?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.591
{\an3}It happens.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.884
(phone rings)

22:23.967 --> 22:24.926
{\an1}It does?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.262
Sometimes.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.555
Yeah. Hello?

22:28.638 --> 22:30.223
Your local hero at your service.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.225
Yes, well, I am here with Gina

22:32.309 --> 22:33.310
right now, Steve.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.437
We need to meet,
the three of us.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.272
(sighs)

22:37.355 --> 22:40.817
Yeah, yeah. I know the spot.
I'll meet you there.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.070
No, you call her.

22:43.153 --> 22:44.946
About ten minutes.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.908
All right.

22:47.991 --> 22:52.662
That was Steve and
he's got a problem.

22:52.746 --> 22:53.955
And you're leaving.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.082
{\an3}Yes.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.792
But I'm also coming back, okay?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.960
So keep the pesto warm.

22:59.044 --> 23:03.131
And, um, we'll do this
when I get back, okay?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.674
Who is "she"?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.802
Janet.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.804
Janet?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.764
{\an3}Yeah. Bye.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.808
{\an1}Bye.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.935
{\an3}(chuckles)

23:19.648 --> 23:21.566
(groans)

23:21.650 --> 23:24.528
I just wanted to collect
my sausage and be done with it.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.071
Now I got a kid named after me!

23:26.154 --> 23:27.823
I know that it might not
seem like it right now,

23:27.906 --> 23:30.283
{\an3}but you are doing all
of us a huge favor.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.827
{\an1}I lie in bed
with my girlfriend at night

23:31.910 --> 23:33.495
and I can't even
look her in the eye.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.038
Tell me, Kelly,
how do you do that with Matt?

23:35.122 --> 23:37.666
{\an1}Because it was
a cup of coffee.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.167
It was perfectly innocent.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.168
A cup of coffee?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.337
Please. You two may as well
sleep together.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.548
You know, you two
don't really fit and yet,

23:44.631 --> 23:47.008
in some kind of weird way,
you do fit.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.510
We see it. We all see it.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.345
Matt sees it and so does Gina.

23:51.638 --> 23:55.809
So, for our sake,
get it over with already, okay?

23:55.892 --> 23:58.019
Thank you. Good night.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.318
Your friend certainly has
a flair for the dramatic.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.154
{\an3}I'll say.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.698
{\an1}(sighs)

24:09.781 --> 24:11.074
I should go.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.035
You think?

24:15.829 --> 24:17.205
How come?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.541
Because of some
of the things he said.

24:21.751 --> 24:22.752
Because he's right.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.178
(engine revs)

24:46.860 --> 24:48.737
{\an1}Okay, Steve,
tell me everything.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.071
What's up, bud?

24:50.155 --> 24:51.281
I've got a date with Katie.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.908
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.534
{\an1}Oh yeah, I caught up
with her yesterday

24:54.618 --> 24:56.411
and we totally hit it off!
We're going to have lunch today.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.413
Did she tell you?
About herself?

24:58.496 --> 25:00.874
Yeah, she-she's from Oakland.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.709
Likes red licorice and...

25:02.792 --> 25:05.170
Is that it?
Is that all she told you?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.838
What? What?
What, does she have a boyfriend?

25:06.922 --> 25:08.089
No. Not currently.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.591
Steve, tell me. What?

25:09.674 --> 25:11.343
I can't tell you.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.929
You know how my luck
has been with women.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.264
{\an1}Look if she's...
if she's got a husband

25:16.348 --> 25:17.974
or-or some infectious disease,

25:18.058 --> 25:20.602
or some war crime
that she's running from...

25:20.685 --> 25:22.729
{\an1}Nope, none of the above.
Is she gonna reject--

25:22.812 --> 25:24.231
She's gonna reject me,
isn't she?

25:24.314 --> 25:26.566
Au contraire, Mohair.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.485
So what, Steve?

25:28.568 --> 25:29.653
Tell me. What?

25:29.736 --> 25:31.279
{\an3}Hi, baby.
Hi.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.572
Hey.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.990
Um, oh, an Officer Mills
just called.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.492
Um, and they want you
to come down

25:35.575 --> 25:36.493
to the station
to I.D. the mugger.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.453
I can't do that.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.956
Well, they just messed up
some paperwork, or something.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.249
And they said it'd take,
like, two minutes

25:42.332 --> 25:43.375
to look at a line-up.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.502
Well, that's shoddy police work.
Can't they call Kelly?

25:45.585 --> 25:47.504
I don't know.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.965
I have to call Kelly.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.800
{\an1}Wait, Steve.
Hey. Hey, wait.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.260
No. No. Where
are you going?

25:53.343 --> 25:55.971
She's a nymphomaniac,
okay? Katie.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.722
You're on your own.

25:57.806 --> 26:02.060
But be careful-- she eats bigger
things than you for breakfast.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.941
Is he acting weird?

26:10.068 --> 26:11.778
{\an1}He just said
she's a nymphomaniac

26:11.861 --> 26:13.863
like that's a bad thing.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.324
{\an1}(laughing)

26:16.408 --> 26:18.660
{\an1}Yeah, I'd say
he's acting weird.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.620
Yeah.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.504
{\an3}I got flowers yesterday
and this morning a message

26:29.587 --> 26:31.047
{\an3}saying you're
taking me to lunch.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.800
{\an1}Well, it's National Be Nice
to Your Boyfriend Week.

26:33.883 --> 26:34.843
Didn't you know?

26:34.926 --> 26:36.928
I do now.
(moans)

26:40.807 --> 26:42.851
(moaning)

26:42.934 --> 26:44.894
(chuckles)

26:46.229 --> 26:49.399
So, where to now?

26:49.482 --> 26:50.734
Rose City Diner.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.193
I don't want to go there.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.362
{\an1}I-I got what I want.
I saw her.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.906
She's just like you, Noah.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.492
{\an3}Except that she understands
herself even less.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.285
You talked to her?

27:00.368 --> 27:01.536
Yeah.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.330
I didn't-I didn't
tell her anything.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.372
But you were right.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.543
She has a life of her own
and a mom and a stepdad.

27:08.626 --> 27:09.586
{\an1}Well, good.
Then she doesn't need me.

27:09.669 --> 27:13.048
{\an3}And she's leaving, so
it might not be so easy

27:13.131 --> 27:14.466
to find her next time..

27:21.598 --> 27:23.600
Do you know I love you?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.685
{\an1}Yes.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.438
{\an3}You know I'd
never hurt you.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.523
{\an1}I know.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.109
So I think that you should go
and introduce yourself to her.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.569
And maybe...

27:34.652 --> 27:37.405
{\an3}Maybe I'm completely
wrong here, but...

27:37.489 --> 27:40.283
{\an3}what if you never get the
chance to do it again?

27:40.367 --> 27:42.410
{\an3}Huh?

27:44.162 --> 27:45.330
{\an3}(giggles)

27:50.335 --> 27:53.421
(groans anxiously)

27:53.505 --> 27:55.090
{\an3}Okay, we've
got our line-up.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.424
Sorry about the delay.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.468
Um, did Kelly Taylor
show up yet?

27:58.551 --> 27:59.552
{\an3}Ms. Taylor called
from her car.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.389
She's stuck in traffic,
but we only need one I.D.,

28:02.472 --> 28:04.182
so we're okay.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.643
I think I'm gonna be sick.

28:07.811 --> 28:08.770
Are you okay?

28:08.853 --> 28:10.563
No, I think
I got to sit down.

28:10.647 --> 28:11.773
{\an3}Would you like
some water?

28:11.856 --> 28:13.483
I don't think
that's gonna do it.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.110
Am I late?

28:15.193 --> 28:16.945
Uh, actually, we had
a delay of our own.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.239
Steve's sick.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.618
{\an3}No problem. We
only need one ID.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.453
The report on this guy is
somewhere. No one can find it.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.496
Kelly, would you come
this way, please?

28:26.579 --> 28:29.165
Uh, okay.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.292
{\an3}Uh...

28:33.169 --> 28:35.171
{\an3}(groans)

28:37.048 --> 28:39.342
Steve...

28:39.426 --> 28:41.594
normally, you would take
credit for an earthquake

28:41.678 --> 28:42.637
if you thought
you could get away with it.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.140
And you're saying

28:45.223 --> 28:46.474
that all this attention
doesn't suit you?

28:46.558 --> 28:47.434
No. What I keep saying

28:47.517 --> 28:50.603
is that it's not <i> me.</i>

28:50.687 --> 28:52.647
Why? It's really great.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.524
It's-It's truly heroic.

28:54.607 --> 28:57.402
Yeah, but... I didn't do it.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.405
It wasn't me.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.457
{\an3}Thank you.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.835
You're a fast eater.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.670
Yeah, I guess I am.

29:15.753 --> 29:16.796
They have the best desserts.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.799
{\an3}You know, I have a cappuccino
machine back at my place

29:19.883 --> 29:21.092
and my roommate isn't home.

29:22.719 --> 29:27.390
{\an3}I just thought, you know, we
could relax, do something.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.517
I can't go to your place.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.852
I can swing at your place.
That's cool.

29:30.935 --> 29:31.853
{\an1}No!

29:31.936 --> 29:34.439
I have a nail appointment.

29:34.522 --> 29:37.692
At, um, 2:30.

29:37.775 --> 29:39.319
A nail appointment?

29:41.321 --> 29:44.491
(chuckles humorlessly)

29:52.123 --> 29:53.666
{\an1}Hey. Listen.
Hey.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.210
I need to talk to you.
Okay.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.253
I'm alone.
Um...

29:57.337 --> 29:59.380
{\an1}I just came from
the police station.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.548
Janet knows.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.674
So?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.843
Dylan, people know, okay?

30:03.927 --> 30:05.345
You do whatever
you need to do,

30:05.428 --> 30:08.598
{\an1}but I think that I'm going
to tell Matt the truth.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.350
About everything?

30:10.433 --> 30:12.060
Yeah, about everything.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.270
About Mexico?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.940
Yeah, I think so.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.234
{\an3}So, in other words, you
and Matt are breaking up.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.362
It's what's best for me, okay?

30:22.445 --> 30:25.740
{\an3}Yeah, well, think about
what's right for us, Kel.

30:25.823 --> 30:27.200
Us?

30:27.283 --> 30:29.452
The way I see it, we're
in this thing together.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.372
And I don't really like

30:32.455 --> 30:33.164
{\an3}the way I've been
treating Gina,

30:33.248 --> 30:35.458
{\an3}so maybe it's
time for a change.

30:35.542 --> 30:39.879
Well, don't change for me.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.844
What time is it?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.221
Ten of 3:00.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.348
{\an3}Rycoff said we'd get
the final offer by 3:00.

30:50.431 --> 30:51.599
{\an1}Oh, 3:00.
Is that normal?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.268
{\an1}I mean, we weren't
too tough on him, were we?

30:53.351 --> 30:55.436
Gina, relax, okay?

30:55.520 --> 30:56.479
What's in my hand?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.606
It's confidence.
(laughing)

30:58.690 --> 30:59.649
Take some, okay?

30:59.732 --> 31:00.567
Okay, I'm trying.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.902
{\an1}Wait, you're not out
of fax paper, are you?

31:02.986 --> 31:03.987
I mean your fax machine
is on and it's working

31:04.070 --> 31:05.071
{\an1}and you've had
it checked recently?

31:05.154 --> 31:06.281
Phone line is fine.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.407
Plenty of fax paper. You?

31:07.490 --> 31:09.158
{\an3}You have to start believing
in yourself, all right?

31:09.242 --> 31:10.285
Right, okay.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.619
{\an3}When you know what you want,
sometimes you got to start

31:11.703 --> 31:12.829
by saying what?

31:12.912 --> 31:13.955
(both, in low register):
No!

31:14.038 --> 31:15.331
Right.
Oh, yes.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.666
{\an1}And the same is true
in life, as well.

31:16.749 --> 31:17.709
See? You remember.

31:17.792 --> 31:18.960
Yeah, I remember you said that.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.462
Maybe I should be a little less
available to Dylan from now on.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.297
(laughs)

31:22.380 --> 31:23.047
{\an1}(gasps)
Okay. Here it is! Here it is!

31:23.131 --> 31:24.215
{\an1}You get it.
No, I'm gonna get it

31:24.299 --> 31:26.509
{\an1}and read it to you. No, no,
you get it and read it to me.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.385
You... Okay, you.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.637
(giggles anxiously):
Okay, I'm listening.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.472
{\an3}Here we go.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.641
{\an6}(goofily):
"Mr. Durning, we
regret to inform you

31:33.725 --> 31:35.476
"that Kitty Shavers...

31:35.560 --> 31:38.479
{\an6}(muted):
"We regret to inform
you that Kitty Shavers

31:38.563 --> 31:39.939
"has agreed to terms.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.482
Thank you for your interest."

31:41.566 --> 31:43.651
Oh.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.445
I...

31:45.528 --> 31:49.907
{\an1}But, uh, you said,
"Believe in yourself."

31:49.991 --> 31:51.159
{\an1}You said that I should
take a chance.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.327
{\an1}Right?

31:52.410 --> 31:53.661
That's what you said!

31:53.745 --> 31:54.996
Gina, she was always
their first choice,

31:55.079 --> 31:56.205
I mean, asking for more or less

31:56.289 --> 31:57.332
wouldn't necessarily
change that.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.458
{\an1}Matt, what are you
talking about?

31:58.541 --> 31:59.459
{\an1}If we would have said yes
to begin with, then maybe...

31:59.542 --> 32:00.376
She would have lowered
the fee more quickly.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.170
You don't know
that that's true, do you?

32:02.253 --> 32:03.087
I mean, sometimes in life,

32:03.171 --> 32:04.130
people just need
to take what they can get.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.466
Not big corporations
with millions of dollars.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.301
Well, maybe not them, but <i> me.</i>

32:13.890 --> 32:15.558
I wanted this.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.313
I really wanted this.

32:20.396 --> 32:22.607
You blew it.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.375
I don't see her.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.459
That's that, then.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.377
{\an1}Two?

32:42.460 --> 32:45.046
{\an3}Um, actually, we're
looking for Rene.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.506
She left early.
Got some sort of a deal

32:46.589 --> 32:48.174
on her plane ticket
over the internet.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.385
Kind of left me in a jam,
thank you very much.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.387
Do you think you can
give me her number?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.389
I'm sorry. I can't give out
that information.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.307
It's just not meant to be.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.017
{\an3}Noah, wait.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.268
Don't be mad.

32:59.352 --> 33:00.269
Look, I'm not mad at you

33:00.353 --> 33:02.230
I'm just kidding myself
thinking something good

33:02.313 --> 33:03.439
might come out of my family,

33:03.523 --> 33:05.358
and I could actually
be a part of it.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.664
Sal, can we talk?

33:38.516 --> 33:41.477
(door closes)

33:41.561 --> 33:43.771
Hey.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.023
Why didn't you answer?

33:47.024 --> 33:49.986
How you doing?

33:50.069 --> 33:52.655
I have been looking
all over for you.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.742
Yeah, I know--
I got your messages.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.453
You said we need to talk.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.122
What's the matter?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.415
{\an1}Is...

34:02.498 --> 34:04.375
something wrong with your deal?

34:04.459 --> 34:06.919
Uh, no, there is no deal.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.922
Kitty Shavers signed another
three-year contract, so...

34:10.005 --> 34:12.257
I thought you were set?

34:12.341 --> 34:14.510
No. They were just
using me as leverage.

34:14.594 --> 34:17.804
{\an6}Mm.
(laughs,
sniffles)

34:17.889 --> 34:20.349
It's kind of
the story of my life.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.393
The next best thing.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.981
You know, Gina,
you don't need that.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.485
You can live without that deal.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.652
Yeah, I know.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.697
Especially since
everything else in my life

34:34.781 --> 34:36.824
is so fulfilling.
(laughs)

34:38.743 --> 34:41.204
Are you about to tell me
what else I can live without?

34:41.286 --> 34:43.706
It's nothing.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.833
(whispers):
Come here.

34:46.876 --> 34:47.877
Mm.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.819
{\an1}I got a strange
message from Sal.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.695
{\an1}Sal?
Yeah,

35:14.779 --> 35:16.739
he's the owner
of the Rose City Diner.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.407
He said that
you wanted to see me.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.701
Yeah, um, I was
thinking about you.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.912
If you're asking me out,
I can't, because...

35:22.995 --> 35:24.539
I'm leaving
for Florida tonight.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.875
{\an1}Plus, Donna's
a really great girl.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.877
(chuckles):
I know she is.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.838
{\an3}Look, don't
you think

35:31.921 --> 35:34.215
we kind of look alike
a little bit?

35:34.298 --> 35:35.424
I mean, our eyes

35:35.508 --> 35:37.385
or the way we smile?

35:37.468 --> 35:39.762
Uh, yeah, sure we do.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.931
I'm so glad I came by.

35:42.014 --> 35:45.393
{\an3}Look, there's a reason
I'm acting like this, okay?

35:45.476 --> 35:48.771
The reason is, um...

35:48.855 --> 35:50.898
you're my sister.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.526
Say that again, because
I thought you just said

35:53.609 --> 35:55.570
that I was your sister.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.780
Well, your biological father
and my father,

35:57.864 --> 36:01.409
they're the same guy.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.120
{\an3}Maybe I shouldn't
have told you.

36:05.329 --> 36:08.124
(laughs):
You've got to be kidding me.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.377
I've got a brother?

36:11.460 --> 36:13.921
{\an3}Listen, I'm not telling you
this 'cause I want you to stay

36:14.005 --> 36:16.549
or I want to mess with
your life in any way.

36:16.632 --> 36:19.260
{\an3}I just want you to know,
wherever you go,

36:19.343 --> 36:21.762
{\an3}whatever you do,
you've got a brother...

36:21.846 --> 36:23.472
{\an3}right here.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.891
Okay?

36:24.974 --> 36:25.808
Yeah.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.435
Come here.

36:37.987 --> 36:41.657
I don't even know how
to tell you this, but, uh...

36:41.741 --> 36:43.117
I'm not a hero.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.620
I wasn't even there.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.288
I don't understand.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.915
Why wouldn't your friend
want to take the credit?

36:48.998 --> 36:50.750
{\an3}Because he likes
his privacy.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.293
So if you want

36:52.376 --> 36:54.253
{\an3}to change your son's
name, I'll understand.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.464
Steve's not exactly
the name of a hero.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.673
Of course it is.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.967
It's also the name
of my husband.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.512
Oh, we're
all packed up.

37:04.847 --> 37:05.765
{\an3}Hey,

37:05.848 --> 37:06.807
you're the guy...

37:06.891 --> 37:07.808
{\an3}JACKIE:
Um, sugar bear?

37:07.892 --> 37:09.602
Can you give us a minute?

37:09.685 --> 37:10.645
Sure.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.608
That was <i> my</i> Steve.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.985
Now I have two:
a big and a little.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.528
Steves are nice.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.821
I like them.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.990
You should hang on to yours.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.659
{\an3}Hear that?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.494
{\an3}You should hang
on to yours.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.623
(laughs)

37:30.706 --> 37:32.583
(knocking)

37:36.003 --> 37:36.879
Hey.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.464
Hi.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.425
{\an3}Uh, Kelly isn't
here, so...

37:41.509 --> 37:43.719
{\an1}I know; she left me a message.
I'm gonna meet her later.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.889
{\an1}But, uh...
we never opened this.

37:46.973 --> 37:49.642
{\an3}Yeah. We didn't
really have a reason.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.811
Well, maybe we do.

37:51.894 --> 37:54.021
Okay.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.357
<i>I'll</i> drink.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.901
What are we
celebrating?

37:58.985 --> 38:01.904
Um... I want to offer you a job.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.906
{\an1}A job?
Yeah. You know,

38:03.990 --> 38:06.492
around my office, just filing,
maybe some research.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.494
{\an4}There's plenty
of stuff to do--
I figure you can

38:08.577 --> 38:10.204
probably make back
your Skating Channel money

38:10.288 --> 38:11.872
in about six, seven years.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.749
(laughs)

38:13.833 --> 38:15.126
Great.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.380
Uh, look, Matt,

38:19.463 --> 38:21.716
{\an3}I know it wasn't
your fault.

38:21.799 --> 38:25.928
Uh, no, no, no, Gina, this is
not out of guilt, believe me.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.056
I just, I'm-I'm worried you're
taking some lesson from this,

38:29.140 --> 38:31.892
{\an1}and if it's the one
that you're not worth much,

38:31.976 --> 38:33.728
well, that's the wrong one.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.439
Well, the jobs aren't exactly
rolling in for me right now.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.232
{\an1}I'm talking
about your life.

38:38.315 --> 38:40.776
Okay? At my office, you
wondered if you should say no

38:40.860 --> 38:42.194
to Dylan more often.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.740
Dylan isn't exactly
pushing for more from me.

38:45.823 --> 38:48.868
Then maybe you
should push him away.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.955
Believe me,
it would be his loss.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.920
(rock music playing)

39:00.004 --> 39:01.255
Hey.

39:01.338 --> 39:03.090
{\an1}Hi.
I wasn't sure

39:03.174 --> 39:04.216
you got my message--
thanks for coming down here.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.761
Actually, I'm on my way
to the airport. How are you?

39:06.844 --> 39:07.595
I'm fine.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.639
{\an1}I kind of wanted
to talk about yesterday.

39:10.723 --> 39:11.766
So did I, actually.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.726
Yeah? You want to sit?

39:13.809 --> 39:15.061
You know what? I can't.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.437
I'm really in a hurry.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.689
Come on. Huh?

39:24.904 --> 39:25.946
Okay.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.990
(exhales):
David...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.242
I bite my nails,
I hate manicures,

39:30.326 --> 39:33.079
and I ended our date early
the other night because I'm...

39:34.872 --> 39:37.833
Okay, you know,
this was a bad idea.

39:37.917 --> 39:38.876
I know.

39:40.878 --> 39:45.716
I, uh, I-I know about
your problem with sex.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.928
Steve told you.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.763
He was trying
to do the right thing.

39:51.931 --> 39:54.683
It's kind of been
a hobby for him lately.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.144
Well, I guess that saves me
from having to admit it.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.648
So what do you want to know?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.359
I wanted to know if you
would go out with me again.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.447
Just for a nice,
leisurely dinner.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.824
Yeah.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.827
Yeah, I'd like that a lot.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.829
You sure you won't be violating
your recovery or anything?

40:14.912 --> 40:16.831
(laughs)

40:16.914 --> 40:18.874
Sexual Dependents Anonymous

40:18.958 --> 40:21.836
has helped me understand myself
so much better.

40:21.919 --> 40:22.837
(chuckles)

40:22.920 --> 40:24.880
It's been a long time since...

40:25.881 --> 40:27.675
Well, you know.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.009
No kidding.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.846
A really, really long time.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.472
(laughs)

40:33.556 --> 40:35.474
And I'm feeling much...

40:35.558 --> 40:37.518
healthier now.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.313
I'd like to move forward, David.

40:41.397 --> 40:44.024
And I'd like to do it with you.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.829
Hey. I got your message.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.375
{\an1}Can we talk?
Yeah. You want to...

41:01.458 --> 41:04.795
{\an4}you want to go
for a ride or...?
No.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.928
{\an3}Well...

41:13.012 --> 41:15.890
what's on your mind?

41:17.641 --> 41:18.893
The other day--

41:18.976 --> 41:22.563
{\an5}the morning that
Jackie Michaels
had her baby...

41:22.646 --> 41:24.732
Yeah?

41:24.815 --> 41:27.651
{\an1}I wasn't with Steve,
I was with Dylan.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.530
We lied to everybody.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.698
You lied to me.

41:32.781 --> 41:33.908
Why?

41:33.991 --> 41:35.576
It was so stupid.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.411
I didn't want to hurt you.

41:37.494 --> 41:40.789
Do you want to tell me
how you might have?

41:40.873 --> 41:42.541
I just, I didn't
want you to worry.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.752
We ran into each other,

41:44.835 --> 41:48.255
we sat in my car
and had coffee and talked.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.924
You talked--
and after you talked, what?

41:50.007 --> 41:51.926
Nothing happened.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.093
Nothing.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.762
Nothing happened?

41:54.845 --> 41:56.263
No, nothing happened, huh?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.807
Except you got Steve
in on it, and Janet.

41:58.891 --> 41:59.808
And what, huh?

41:59.892 --> 42:01.977
{\an1}A few more intense moments
with Dylan to go over

42:02.061 --> 42:03.771
{\an5}the little game plan,
is that it?
No.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.105
We were never playing a game.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.732
{\an1}Why do you
hang on to him?

42:06.815 --> 42:08.400
Huh? What, do you enjoy it?

42:08.484 --> 42:11.070
He... he's my friend.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.655
He's your friend--
well, if that were true,

42:12.738 --> 42:14.323
you wouldn't need
to lie to me, would you?

42:14.406 --> 42:17.993
You're not making it very easy
to tell the truth right now.

42:18.077 --> 42:20.746
Point taken.

42:20.829 --> 42:23.624
So, if I run into him,
and we end up alone,

42:23.707 --> 42:25.834
you want me to tell you,
is that it?

42:25.918 --> 42:27.419
I'll get jealous, I don't know.

42:27.503 --> 42:30.464
But you want me
to tell you the truth, right?

42:30.547 --> 42:32.591
Kelly, of course I want you
to tell me the truth, okay?

42:32.675 --> 42:34.843
{\an1}And let me tell
<i>you</i> the truth.

42:34.927 --> 42:37.096
The idea of you two spending
time together, I don't like it.

42:48.899 --> 42:49.984
Hi.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.069
How'd you find me?

42:53.362 --> 42:56.156
Your girlfriend said
that you were opening up.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.409
Girlfriend.

42:58.492 --> 43:01.287
I guess the breakup
didn't go so well.

43:01.370 --> 43:04.123
I may not know what kind of
relationship I'm capable of,

43:04.206 --> 43:07.876
but I do know that Gina is the
only one who can deal with me.

43:09.586 --> 43:11.297
How'd it go with Matt?

43:11.380 --> 43:13.173
He was angry,

43:13.257 --> 43:15.926
but we'll work through it.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.805
I didn't tell him about Mexico.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.099
Do you feel better?

43:22.933 --> 43:24.852
Sort of.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.521
So... you're still together,

43:27.605 --> 43:30.691
and it looks like
we are in the same boat.

43:30.774 --> 43:31.942
Not really.

43:33.068 --> 43:35.654
I'm with somebody that
I love and want to be with.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.406
I don't know what you're doing.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.869
Well...

43:41.952 --> 43:43.787
neither do I.
