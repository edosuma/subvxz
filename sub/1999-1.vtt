01:07.500 --> 01:10.412
God has granted
me a long life.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.298
I have seen and
experienced much,

01:18.500 --> 01:19.933
but understood very little.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.930
Well, I guess it has
to be that way.

01:29.660 --> 01:32.618
I dream of Belgrade, Chubura.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.299
That's where I was born.

01:36.820 --> 01:39.732
I can't remember
when and how

01:40.180 --> 01:43.729
football came into our lives.
It was all unplanned.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.448
We thought it was
only a game,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.614
a boyish passion which would
fade away with time.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.498
But that odd game
changed our lives.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.493
Trailing its magic,

01:59.700 --> 02:02.658
we wandered to the far,
unfamiliar world.

02:03.580 --> 02:07.414
Leaving our former lives
and loves behind us

02:07.780 --> 02:11.819
and really believing that we
will return soon, all together.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.657
Everything was new,

02:21.980 --> 02:24.938
except the old friend
who joined us.

02:29.060 --> 02:31.335
Finally, we were all together.

02:32.660 --> 02:36.255
Full of boundless
strength and illusions.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.334
Confident that we were
just going to play soccer.

02:39.980 --> 02:44.496
We didn't even notice how everything
became different in some way.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.738
By facing trouble,
challenges,

03:04.980 --> 03:06.493
and fear of death,

03:07.100 --> 03:10.934
The long journey passed
by in a second.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.933
And when we arrived,

03:17.300 --> 03:20.372
we didn't know if
it was the end

03:21.900 --> 03:23.379
or just the beginning.

03:24.220 --> 03:27.098
MONTEVIDEO
SEE YOU IN

03:32.100 --> 03:33.738
6 JULY 1930
MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY

03:33.940 --> 03:36.408
Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,
our Uruguayan brothers...

03:37.060 --> 03:39.415
Haji, make it short.
It'll be good.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.134
Boza, spruce up the boys a little,
so they look as they should.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.338
There will be journalists, reporters...
clean them up a little.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.372
...which you are
holding in our honor

03:48.220 --> 03:49.289
and to remind you that...

03:49.500 --> 03:50.694
Smarten yourselves up nicely!

03:51.700 --> 03:53.850
There may be reporters there
to take pictures of you.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.419
Gentlemen!
Men, please, be serious.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.616
You'll be photographed.

03:59.820 --> 04:01.731
We are the ambassadors of our...
Careful, careful...

04:04.980 --> 04:07.574
We're not here as individuals
We represent our country as a delegation

04:07.780 --> 04:09.338
and we are the
ambassadors of our land.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.419
Please take note of that.

04:11.980 --> 04:15.689
...I wish to thank
you for... our...

04:16.620 --> 04:17.939
I can't hear the
orchestras here.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.414
Where is the
welcome ceremony?

04:21.779 --> 04:23.338
It seems we missed the exit.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.253
Haji, please,
look over there.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.410
Maybe they're there...

04:35.260 --> 04:36.170
Andrejka!

05:04.501 --> 05:06.810
- Is the bus coming?
- It won't come.

05:09.741 --> 05:10.571
No welcome ceremony.

05:17.141 --> 05:20.929
Boys, let's take a little walk.

05:59.941 --> 06:02.819
Hey! Why didn't you
come to the port?

06:04.301 --> 06:05.370
Holy smoke.

06:12.384 --> 06:14.055
Let's go.

06:14.090 --> 06:15.617
Good day!
Where are you coming from?

06:15.941 --> 06:17.659
We're the Yugoslav
soccer team.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.931
- Hello from Romania.
- We're the French team.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.857
- Hi guys!
- Hi Ivica! Let's have a drink.

06:24.758 --> 06:26.534
Let's go guys.

06:26.941 --> 06:28.420
C'mon, c'mon, what
are we waiting for?

06:36.141 --> 06:37.415
What a pity,
he's all tarted up.

06:40.221 --> 06:41.813
See you on the field.

06:42.221 --> 06:44.416
Hey Romanians!
How are you?

06:44.781 --> 06:46.692
We're ok.
Good luck to you!

06:59.341 --> 07:01.730
Look, Radoje, how nice
the parrots are here.

07:03.061 --> 07:05.734
I can't tell apart the
males from the females.

07:06.381 --> 07:08.212
What's this?
Green bananas?

07:08.581 --> 07:09.331
Unripe?

07:11.981 --> 07:13.460
But the women sure are ripe.

07:13.821 --> 07:14.890
Ripe and black.

07:17.181 --> 07:18.216
Nice town.

07:18.621 --> 07:20.213
Classical
Mediterranean style.

07:21.381 --> 07:24.691
Neocolonial. It's the
influence of Spain, you know.

07:25.501 --> 07:26.377
That's what I said!

07:27.341 --> 07:29.809
You're going to screw
around with Jose!

07:30.621 --> 07:35.376
This is a decent
hotel, not a brothel!

07:35.821 --> 07:37.936
What's wrong with you?

07:38.982 --> 07:43.478
- Calm down!
- You're crazy, man!

07:43.541 --> 07:45.418
What are you doing?

07:56.301 --> 07:58.656
Consuelo, get in here now!

07:58.981 --> 08:00.300
And you, you...

08:00.781 --> 08:02.100
You like to screw around, huh?

08:02.661 --> 08:03.776
You like it, huh?

08:05.181 --> 08:06.330
I'll kill you!

08:07.781 --> 08:10.136
Welcome to the Paraiso Hotel.

08:10.581 --> 08:15.052
I wish to greet our dear
guests from Russia!

08:15.970 --> 08:19.428
- Yugoslavia.
- From Yugogoslavia.

08:19.501 --> 08:20.775
Welcome to Paraiso.

08:29.581 --> 08:31.697
He says there's a small
problem with the electricity.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.926
- In what sense?
- In the sense that there is none.

08:39.181 --> 08:40.409
- Jose!
- What is it?

08:40.981 --> 08:43.370
Someone crapped in
the left toilet. It's jammed.

08:43.741 --> 08:46.778
So what do I do now?
Don't fuck with me!

08:47.541 --> 08:49.577
Please, just a moment.

08:49.861 --> 08:51.214
Eduardo, Eduardo!

08:51.581 --> 08:53.060
Well, what are
you doing there?

08:53.261 --> 08:54.819
The suitcases, come on!

08:56.981 --> 08:59.097
The keys, Consuelo!

09:03.101 --> 09:04.420
Welcome to our hotel!

09:04.701 --> 09:08.455
Come on, come on, Eduardo.
We can't spend the whole day here!

09:08.741 --> 09:12.734
Please, ma'am, where
is the FIFA office?

09:13.461 --> 09:14.860
FIFA, soccer.

09:15.301 --> 09:17.257
Fucking?
- fifar -

09:18.501 --> 09:19.854
FIFA, soccer...

09:20.461 --> 09:21.735
Thank you, ma'am,
thank you.

09:22.261 --> 09:25.048
- Can you go a bit quicker?
- How?

09:25.083 --> 09:27.017
C'mon granpa.
Take his stuff.

09:29.381 --> 09:31.895
Screw the electricity...

09:32.701 --> 09:35.340
Tirke, this Spanish
language isn't so hard.

09:35.813 --> 09:37.925
I understand everything
this guy said.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.477
Of course you do,
he's one of ours.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.078
- How do you know?
- Can't you hear him swearing?

09:42.113 --> 09:43.697
What's up guys?
Why are you looking at me?

09:43.981 --> 09:45.209
You see, he's
speaking Spanish.

09:45.461 --> 09:46.610
He's speaking Serbian,
I heard him.

09:46.861 --> 09:47.930
Heard shit.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.820
What I'm speaking
isn't Serbian.

09:50.461 --> 09:51.416
We're countrymen.

09:51.621 --> 09:54.818
We're not countrymen. I'm a Croat.
That's different.

09:55.181 --> 09:57.854
So? Croats are some
kind of Yugoslavs.

09:58.581 --> 10:00.572
We are the Yugoslav
national soccer team.

10:00.981 --> 10:03.939
I know you're the
national Yugoslav team.

10:04.301 --> 10:06.496
But, if you are the
national Yugoslav team...

10:07.061 --> 10:08.096
Where are the Croats?

10:08.781 --> 10:10.100
Hurry up Paco.

10:10.301 --> 10:11.939
Leave me alone...
you fat goat...

10:12.581 --> 10:13.457
Where are the Croats?

10:13.821 --> 10:14.776
They didn't come, because...

10:14.981 --> 10:15.697
Because of what?

10:16.181 --> 10:19.935
As you see Yugoslavia, so
you see the national team.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.642
Without the Croats.
That's why I'm here.

10:22.741 --> 10:23.890
Ok, let's go, kid.

10:25.261 --> 10:26.137
Hey Poopster!

10:26.901 --> 10:29.096
Not you, the little guy.

10:29.741 --> 10:31.345
- What happened to you?
- Huh?

10:31.461 --> 10:32.496
What's with your leg?

10:32.741 --> 10:34.015
Nothing.
I was born that way.

10:34.661 --> 10:35.696
With a crutch?

10:35.901 --> 10:36.856
No, without one.

10:38.421 --> 10:40.537
- Let's go kid.
- Hey, guys, wait.

10:40.861 --> 10:44.570
I'm Paco. The Uruguayans call me Paco.
I'm Miljenko Pakovic.

10:45.221 --> 10:48.497
I am master and god here.
If you need something...

10:49.421 --> 10:50.774
...don't feel free
to count on me.

10:53.101 --> 10:54.580
Crazy guys...

10:59.181 --> 11:01.172
Hey, who's the kid
gonna sleep with?

11:01.981 --> 11:03.255
The kid will sleep with me.

11:04.061 --> 11:05.176
This is the key to the room.

11:32.701 --> 11:35.215
Mosa, are you mad at us?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.379
No.
I'm just tired.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.221
Tirke studies
Spanish every day.

11:52.502 --> 11:53.651
Who's he gonna speak it with?

12:16.262 --> 12:17.661
Ooooh...

12:25.382 --> 12:26.701
Are these guys tourists?

12:27.462 --> 12:30.340
You're the tourist here.
They're Brazilians.

12:32.982 --> 12:34.461
I've never seen
anything like this.

12:34.982 --> 12:37.018
Let's see how they do at the match.
It's easy here.

12:38.222 --> 12:39.177
This desn't look easy.

12:42.222 --> 12:43.333
Whaaa?

12:44.622 --> 12:45.338
Tirke.

12:45.822 --> 12:47.175
We could do this
with a live egg.

13:00.542 --> 13:01.258
Look out!

13:04.622 --> 13:05.737
Oh, Jaksic.

13:06.062 --> 13:07.814
I didn't know you had
family in Uruguay.

13:10.462 --> 13:11.861
Jaksic, are you
out of your mind?

13:12.142 --> 13:12.858
What?

13:13.062 --> 13:15.940
If the coach can have his pigeon Radoje,
and Mosa and Tirke have Stanoje,

13:16.702 --> 13:17.817
I can have my
own lucky charm.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.176
Oh come on, please.

13:19.662 --> 13:22.256
I'm tired of goalies being abused
as people and as soccer players.

13:23.782 --> 13:25.420
Hey, he's quite
wordy for a goalie.

13:42.542 --> 13:43.816
That's Hotchkins,

13:45.302 --> 13:46.860
the greatest soccer
trader in the world.

13:48.822 --> 13:49.857
So, he's here as well.

13:50.102 --> 13:51.091
And how do you know him?

13:51.862 --> 13:54.535
He was at the French Cup finals
and he asked about me.

13:56.382 --> 13:57.497
Let me introduce you.

13:58.222 --> 13:58.938
Nah.

15:05.222 --> 15:08.920
Hey, don't touch that motorcycle.
It's not a toy.

15:08.955 --> 15:10.819
- But it's fantastic!
- Yes, it's fantastic.

15:10.854 --> 15:11.658
Hey electricity guy!

15:12.302 --> 15:13.257
What's with the power?

15:13.622 --> 15:14.452
Electricity!

15:15.182 --> 15:17.457
Screw electricity and
everything about it.

15:18.062 --> 15:19.051
What are you looking at?

15:19.302 --> 15:20.371
I'm looking at your shoes.

15:20.862 --> 15:21.772
What's with my shoes?

15:21.982 --> 15:22.698
They're dirty.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.378
Dirty?

15:25.582 --> 15:27.573
I'll clean them, and
you get us electricity.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.042
Sorry,

15:30.077 --> 15:32.211
I have no interest in electricity,
I am interested in girls.

15:32.502 --> 15:33.730
Where can I find them?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.258
Girls?

15:35.462 --> 15:38.181
Sure. I have money,
so I can pay.

15:38.422 --> 15:40.378
Here it's normal
to pay for a girl.

15:42.982 --> 15:44.415
You see this street here?

15:45.215 --> 15:46.252
Yes?

15:46.382 --> 15:47.417
Well, it's not there.

15:48.062 --> 15:49.939
Over there, you go up and
the first to the left.

15:50.142 --> 15:52.178
When you see a red light,
you've found it.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.181
Thanks.

15:56.742 --> 15:57.857
Hasta luego.

15:58.062 --> 15:58.778
What?

15:58.982 --> 16:01.018
Hasta luego.
See you.

16:01.382 --> 16:03.338
Ah!
Yes, see you.

16:15.662 --> 16:16.731
Where are you going?

16:17.782 --> 16:19.613
I'm going to town.
C'mon you too.

16:29.862 --> 16:31.614
- C'mon. Let's go.
- Ok.

16:40.302 --> 16:42.372
Stop, don't come any closer!

16:49.062 --> 16:50.939
Damn, what's this?

16:54.182 --> 16:55.740
Holy smoke.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.612
Come on.
Let's go.

17:30.302 --> 17:32.099
Mosa!
Let's go!

17:32.902 --> 17:34.779
I'll catch up with you.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.695
What's with Mosa?

17:44.542 --> 17:45.895
Let's go to bed.

17:50.342 --> 17:51.491
Let's go.

17:56.262 --> 17:59.777
I am worried about Mosa,
he's not the same as before.

18:00.422 --> 18:03.334
How can he be the same?
He barely survived the voyage.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.692
He'll be ok, he's recovering.

18:06.382 --> 18:09.738
- And Tirke?
- What about Tirke?

18:10.062 --> 18:12.178
Tirke's got love problems.

18:12.622 --> 18:16.774
He found out on the ship that his
girlfriend left him. And he took it hard.

18:17.302 --> 18:19.736
But he'll be right as rain,
I guarantee it.

18:19.942 --> 18:21.295
Is he any good?

18:22.182 --> 18:24.491
Not just good.
He's the best.

18:24.822 --> 18:26.778
That's what I like to hear.

18:28.582 --> 18:31.858
Ok gentlemen, it will be ok.
Cheers.

18:32.182 --> 18:33.774
Cheers.

18:54.343 --> 18:56.937
Look, sir.
Flowers, nice and cheap.

18:57.663 --> 18:58.937
For two pesos.

18:59.223 --> 19:02.181
- I don't have any money.
- I'll give it to you for a peso.

19:02.943 --> 19:04.934
No, thank you.
Sorry... no!

19:05.423 --> 19:06.856
Coca Cola?
American!

19:07.183 --> 19:10.141
- Coconut, very tasty!
- Thank you, no.

19:11.223 --> 19:13.532
Leave him alone,
He told you he doesn't want any.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.691
- Come here.
- Leave him alone.

19:21.663 --> 19:24.052
- You're a sailor?
- I am not a sailor.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.419
This is the Madonna.
She'll protect you forever.

19:26.983 --> 19:29.053
No, no, I'm a soccer player.

19:29.663 --> 19:31.096
- Soccer player?
- Yes.

19:31.863 --> 19:34.218
- Brazilian?
- I'm not Brazilian.

19:34.783 --> 19:36.216
American?

19:36.663 --> 19:39.894
I have a special figurine for
American soccer players.

19:40.303 --> 19:42.021
Chubura.
Belgrade!

19:42.303 --> 19:44.259
Serbia!
Yugoslavia!

19:44.743 --> 19:47.541
- I don't understand.
- Europe!

19:47.783 --> 19:49.262
Look!

20:21.503 --> 20:23.141
Sorry.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.739
No, no.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.816
- Leave the Madonna.
- It's ok. I'll pay for it.

20:36.543 --> 20:38.454
I am very sorry!

20:38.783 --> 20:40.216
You Antichrist!

20:40.543 --> 20:41.942
I'll pay!
I'll pay.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.453
How much is it?

20:46.503 --> 20:48.221
I don't want your money!

20:49.903 --> 20:52.098
I don't want your
money, you Antichrist!

20:52.423 --> 20:55.301
Help! I'm being
attacked by the devil!

21:17.303 --> 21:21.182
Now you're a really
good-looking soccer player.

21:21.823 --> 21:25.099
Even though you were very
handsome before as well.

21:25.503 --> 21:31.180
- I don't understand Spanish very well.
- Never mind.

21:32.983 --> 21:36.259
Is the water cold?
- Yes. - And I'm hot?

21:36.623 --> 21:38.500
Kid, you looking
for trouble again?

21:38.783 --> 21:41.217
Maybe that's not so bad.
Fight fire with fire.

21:41.503 --> 21:42.936
Hey, I'm looking for you.

21:43.343 --> 21:47.780
Who is this handsome guy?
Are all soccer players so handsome?

21:48.543 --> 21:51.421
Mosa, my friend.
The king of soccer.

21:52.943 --> 21:54.934
I'm not the king,
don't exaggerate.

21:55.543 --> 21:59.331
How nice, the king. And you are?
A prince?

21:59.663 --> 22:00.618
Prince, no.

22:00.943 --> 22:05.414
- How do you say right winger?
- Forget it, be a prince tonight.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.932
And don't go crazy
like last time.

22:08.143 --> 22:09.940
I'm starting to
be crazy already.

22:10.343 --> 22:12.538
Wait, I'm looking for you.

22:13.663 --> 22:17.292
- Mosa, my friend. He's very depressed.
- I understand.

22:20.583 --> 22:21.811
Sorry.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.492
We'll meet soon,
handsome Serb.

22:27.075 --> 22:28.542
In a tango bar,

22:28.602 --> 22:32.931
two beautiful girls will be waiting
for the prince and the king of soccer.

22:37.343 --> 22:38.776
Mosa!

22:40.783 --> 22:43.343
- Let's go get a drink.
- I can't. Let's go sleep.

22:43.703 --> 22:48.458
- Are you ok? You seem strange. - I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired. Let's go.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.058
Get out of here...!

23:23.143 --> 23:24.895
What's happening inside?

23:25.183 --> 23:27.060
You took half an hour, fool!

23:28.383 --> 23:30.374
I don't want to see
you here any more.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.097
Respect the rules!

23:32.623 --> 23:34.136
What losers.

23:34.503 --> 23:38.197
A moment, people, a moment.
What's this?

23:38.232 --> 23:40.292
Guys, here's the red light.
Should we check it out?

23:40.503 --> 23:41.856
Get in line!

23:42.223 --> 23:44.339
Come on, I want to
see a proper line.

23:47.863 --> 23:49.376
Get up!

23:49.623 --> 23:52.091
- Come on, come!
- Try me!

23:56.943 --> 23:58.376
What's happening here?

23:58.623 --> 24:00.215
We're not killing anyone here.

24:00.623 --> 24:03.660
We're teaching you
to stop being shy.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.537
Follow me, let's go.

24:08.863 --> 24:10.216
- Let's get in line!
- Let's go.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.620
Guys, um... I'm off home.

24:13.863 --> 24:16.741
- Wait! Maybe he's right.
Wait Jaksic!

24:17.423 --> 24:20.574
Those sick kids are in
my head all the time.

24:20.903 --> 24:22.222
C'mon man!

24:22.423 --> 24:24.778
Ok, now we know where they
are, we can tomorrow.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.092
Forget about the kids.

24:26.663 --> 24:29.814
We're someone's kids as well.
Ballerina!

24:31.703 --> 24:34.740
Come... why are you leaving?

24:35.223 --> 24:38.215
Try us, it's really good!

24:39.263 --> 24:40.696
Tomorrow.

24:51.903 --> 24:57.375
Ladies and gentlemen, at this spectacular
Mundial which is being held in Uruguay

24:57.783 --> 25:00.695
some of the best teams
in the world will meet.

25:01.303 --> 25:06.457
Now, His Excellency the mayor of the
capital of Uruguay will address you.

25:06.663 --> 25:09.939
10 JULY 1930
OPENING CEREMONY

25:10.343 --> 25:12.538
Citizens of Montevideo.

25:12.903 --> 25:15.497
Who plays the best
soccer in the world?

25:16.303 --> 25:18.692
Uruguay!
Uruguay!

25:20.623 --> 25:26.573
I am inviting the president of the
international soccer federation,

25:27.011 --> 25:31.675
Monsieur Jules Rimet,
to open the championship.

25:37.943 --> 25:41.165
I hope this date will
commemorate a

25:41.814 --> 25:45.366
new chapter in the
history of soccer.

25:45.823 --> 25:51.375
I have the honor of announcing
the opening of the World Cup!

25:59.984 --> 26:03.110
We are starting with the draw.

26:03.441 --> 26:06.576
The first team is the
championship's host.

26:06.611 --> 26:10.223
The best soccer
team in the world

26:10.664 --> 26:13.053
Uruguay!

26:21.744 --> 26:24.861
The opposing team is

26:25.384 --> 26:27.022
the national team of...

26:27.304 --> 26:28.453
Rumania.

26:28.704 --> 26:31.093
Almost...

26:32.424 --> 26:33.539
Rumanians!

26:33.904 --> 26:37.692
Uruguay?
Sorry about that...

26:38.384 --> 26:40.102
They might as well
get packed and go home.

26:40.504 --> 26:42.301
Home, eh?

26:44.704 --> 26:47.093
France!

26:50.064 --> 26:52.134
Good luck, boys!

26:54.784 --> 26:58.379
And the opposing team is...

26:58.704 --> 27:01.093
Hey, which team would
you like us to draw?

27:01.344 --> 27:03.778
- I don't know. What ever...
- I'd like someone serious.

27:04.224 --> 27:05.418
So serious they'll beat us.

27:05.784 --> 27:10.380
The United States of America!

27:22.384 --> 27:24.739
Brazil!

27:30.544 --> 27:32.296
By god, if I got my
hands on this one,

27:32.944 --> 27:35.219
I wouldn't let her go.
If you know what I mean...

27:35.504 --> 27:36.823
And if we both got
our hands on her?

27:36.984 --> 27:38.702
Hey, don't jinx us.

27:38.984 --> 27:39.939
C'mon.

27:40.264 --> 27:42.573
The opposing team is...

27:44.144 --> 27:46.294
Yugoslavia!

27:57.424 --> 28:00.939
Serb, it seems you'll
go home before us!

28:02.424 --> 28:06.622
Please, one more picture!

28:07.104 --> 28:08.298
C'mon, smile.
Smile.

28:08.984 --> 28:10.861
Hey, kid, your
wish has come true.

28:11.384 --> 28:15.013
Ok, when I said serious,
I didn't mean that serious.

29:18.064 --> 29:19.463
Where are you going guys?

29:19.904 --> 29:21.576
We're off to...

29:21.984 --> 29:24.054
- I don't want to swear now.
- Go on, swear.

29:24.424 --> 29:25.903
That frigging draw.

29:26.224 --> 29:30.342
Ok, Brazilians are Brazilians.
What can we do about it now?

29:30.704 --> 29:33.093
Let's have some fun, now that
we're going home in a few days.

29:33.464 --> 29:34.863
I can't sleep anyway.

30:10.184 --> 30:13.938
The people here have a great
respect for the church.

30:15.704 --> 30:20.300
I just hope FIFA is not in
cahoots with the heavens.

30:20.624 --> 30:24.617
So there will be no pressure
from up there on the referees.

30:25.864 --> 30:30.733
Mr Andrejevic... You know that a
domestic field has its advantages.

30:31.424 --> 30:34.416
But this is an
international competition,

30:35.584 --> 30:39.782
and we're doing
everything to keep order.

30:43.224 --> 30:45.533
God almighty, how long
do we have to wait here?

30:45.784 --> 30:47.934
C'mon guys, rapido, rapido.

30:51.784 --> 30:53.297
What were you doing so long?

30:53.584 --> 30:55.302
The guy's crazy!

31:08.504 --> 31:13.339
Guys... The service is alright,
but the comfort is a little problematic.

31:14.944 --> 31:18.175
Gentlemen, this won't come out
in the press, don't worry.

31:18.464 --> 31:22.059
When you finish, Bora will take you
to a bar, over there.

31:22.264 --> 31:25.017
I can't wait...
C'mon guys, let's go.

31:25.304 --> 31:28.216
The first street to the left.
Yes, you can't miss it.

31:33.504 --> 31:34.698
Like this?

31:38.744 --> 31:39.938
Or like this?

31:40.504 --> 31:42.540
Or like this?

31:48.704 --> 31:53.380
Look.
Like this...

32:02.224 --> 32:03.782
Do not touch my sister.

32:04.304 --> 32:05.703
I don't want to see you
any more with Dolores.

32:05.984 --> 32:07.178
Kike, please.

32:15.504 --> 32:17.176
If I see you, I'll kill you.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.779
Sit down and relax.

32:34.304 --> 32:35.498
Are you ok?

32:42.304 --> 32:43.498
Kid, where are you going now?

32:44.144 --> 32:45.372
Tirke!

32:50.824 --> 32:53.099
I can't sleep.

32:53.904 --> 32:57.420
You're used to snoring,
so the silence bothers you.

32:58.825 --> 33:02.898
All this is too much for me.
And now Brazil...

33:05.105 --> 33:06.936
Anyway, everything is...

33:07.825 --> 33:11.659
Like my late father would say,
who knows why that's good.

33:15.985 --> 33:19.136
Ok, go if you insist so much.
Go.

33:19.385 --> 33:20.374
What happened?

33:20.665 --> 33:24.729
Radoje has a problem
with jetlag,

33:24.850 --> 33:27.618
so I let him go to
his evening training.

33:38.785 --> 33:40.104
This is a nice city.

33:40.745 --> 33:41.939
Yes.

33:44.465 --> 33:47.218
And the girls are pretty.
And dangerous...

33:53.465 --> 33:56.343
We all went through
what's bothering you now.

33:58.225 --> 34:00.181
You'll be ok.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.819
And what's wrong with you?

34:07.745 --> 34:08.938
You seem a bit strange?

34:10.625 --> 34:13.185
I'm not the same
man any longer.

34:14.705 --> 34:16.377
I can't even run any more.

34:16.985 --> 34:18.737
Real aces don't have to run.

34:20.905 --> 34:22.940
Even the ball doesn't
listen to me anymore.

34:23.385 --> 34:25.376
And that's the only
thing that ever did.

34:29.784 --> 34:33.858
I play ball for money,
but I always owe money.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.094
Occasionally, I find a woman,

34:42.344 --> 34:44.301
but I'm alone.

34:48.864 --> 34:50.422
I've decided to stay.

34:51.145 --> 34:52.339
I'm not going back.

34:52.585 --> 34:56.543
I can't go back to the ship,
I barely survived it.

34:59.825 --> 35:02.544
We didn't come here
to stay, did we?

35:02.985 --> 35:04.941
Who knows why we came.

35:09.945 --> 35:11.139
Let's go.

35:36.545 --> 35:38.536
Poopster, are you free?

35:38.945 --> 35:41.618
What about a motorcycle ride?

35:42.985 --> 35:44.577
- For real?
- For real.

35:57.065 --> 36:02.264
All Zivkovic had to do was cross the
ocean, and look what happened...

36:02.585 --> 36:04.940
What should we do about jerseys?
We don't have any.

36:05.425 --> 36:08.064
They can play naked
like the old Greeks.

36:08.465 --> 36:11.855
- You'll find some jerseys.
- Me? - A set.

36:12.265 --> 36:15.940
I will find the
jerseys for you. Me.

36:19.105 --> 36:21.619
Where can I find them?

36:24.905 --> 36:29.501
- I didn't even ask you. What's your name?
- Stanoje. - Stanoje.

36:29.865 --> 36:35.144
A long name for a small person.
It's il contrario from mine.

36:35.385 --> 36:37.535
I am Paco. A short
name but a big man.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.903
- Paco, can you make beans?
- You mean butter beans?

36:41.345 --> 36:45.497
When I make beans, everyone
licks their fingers and toes.

36:45.785 --> 36:48.424
Can you make some for my pals,
to encourage them for the match?

36:48.665 --> 36:52.180
That's a good idea Poopster.
Great idea.

36:52.425 --> 36:55.462
I'll earn some money and get the wine.
Stop here, stop!

36:55.825 --> 36:59.056
- You won't clean shoes here, will you?
- I will, why?

36:59.785 --> 37:01.935
It's embarrassing,
someone will see us.

37:02.185 --> 37:05.780
It's not embarrassing.
I earn my money honestly.

37:08.305 --> 37:10.865
There's no one to
make money but me.

37:11.225 --> 37:13.181
And your pals,
do they have any money?

37:13.425 --> 37:16.064
Them? They're as
poor as church mice.

37:16.585 --> 37:20.942
You're all like church mice.
I was smart to escape.

37:21.345 --> 37:23.381
Are you going to
help me or what?

37:25.945 --> 37:28.334
Hey.
How do you play on this?

37:30.985 --> 37:32.896
Don't they feel sorry
to step on this?

37:33.825 --> 37:35.224
What are you looking for?

37:46.825 --> 37:50.864
You see, the poles
are holding it up.

37:51.145 --> 37:52.339
Well, yes.

37:53.985 --> 37:57.739
Guys! Let's go,
we have a lot of work.

37:58.265 --> 38:00.062
That means we'll talk now?

38:00.425 --> 38:03.462
We're not going to talk at all.
We're all talked out.

38:04.465 --> 38:06.342
What would you like
to talk about?

38:06.745 --> 38:07.939
About Brazil, for example.

38:08.265 --> 38:11.223
We don't have to talk about Brazil at all!
Everything is clear.

38:11.585 --> 38:14.657
If we could run away,
I'd be the first one to run.

38:15.225 --> 38:19.855
Here, we'll do this
differently now.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.694
We'll play on one goal.

38:24.145 --> 38:26.898
Everyone to the left, come on.

38:27.625 --> 38:32.380
Now let's all go to the right.
Come closer.

38:32.825 --> 38:34.543
Now everyone to
the left, closer.

38:35.185 --> 38:36.379
Now to the right...

38:36.785 --> 38:38.423
And to the left...

38:38.945 --> 38:40.139
everyone left.

38:40.345 --> 38:41.778
This is like our kolo dance.

38:41.985 --> 38:46.058
That's it!
Like the kolo dance.

38:46.385 --> 38:49.502
We'll match their
samba with our kolo.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.337
And us?
What should we do?

38:51.585 --> 38:56.454
You will kick the ball between the
midfielder's legs, in the first strike.

38:56.705 --> 38:57.899
Got it?

38:58.105 --> 38:58.901
Mosa!

38:59.225 --> 39:04.094
You know when you slam the player in
the field... Do that at the beginning!

39:04.665 --> 39:08.101
Milutinac! How did your grandfather
command during the war?

39:08.438 --> 39:10.720
- Follow me! - That's what
you'll do tomorrow!

39:10.755 --> 39:11.899
And me?

39:13.225 --> 39:14.419
You what?

39:14.665 --> 39:15.734
You have to score a goal,

39:15.985 --> 39:18.818
why did we bring you here...

39:19.545 --> 39:20.614
Come on Tirke!

39:20.945 --> 39:22.139
Lead the kolo dance.

39:22.785 --> 39:24.537
C'mon.
Go get them!

39:25.305 --> 39:27.773
Let's dance!

39:28.265 --> 39:30.381
Closer!
Get closer.

39:42.225 --> 39:43.419
Closer.
Good.

39:45.665 --> 39:46.859
Everyone to the right!

39:47.905 --> 39:49.099
That's it!

39:50.985 --> 39:53.704
Everyone to the left!

39:53.905 --> 39:56.021
To the left again!

40:13.306 --> 40:14.639
Here's the Serbian bread.

40:15.386 --> 40:18.423
Uruguay, you'll never
be a real country.

40:18.866 --> 40:22.142
Here's the bread, you devils.
Break a piece off.

40:22.546 --> 40:26.016
- Are Paco's beans any good?
- Real good, excellent.

40:26.466 --> 40:27.660
C'mon.
Enjoy.

40:29.266 --> 40:30.665
Look at this.
Delicious.

40:30.866 --> 40:32.060
Give me some, please.

40:33.146 --> 40:37.139
Sir, there is some grilled
fish for the gentlemen!

40:38.066 --> 40:39.897
I like simple things.
Serve.

40:40.186 --> 40:42.097
Oh, ok.

40:43.626 --> 40:46.663
Here. Do you have wine?
Do you have...

40:46.986 --> 40:48.214
wait, here's the wine.

40:48.986 --> 40:51.898
What is with the wine, woman?

40:52.106 --> 40:54.176
That's it, sir, more
wine here, please.

40:54.386 --> 40:58.618
Here it is, Uruguyan trout
with Serbian bread.

41:00.986 --> 41:04.615
Tell me what we owe you
so we can pay.

41:04.826 --> 41:08.375
You'll pay it off
to Brazil tomorrow.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.134
In that honor,
some more wine.

41:11.346 --> 41:13.098
Poopster,

41:13.426 --> 41:16.498
where are you going? -I'm going
to the hotel. I'm tired.

41:16.706 --> 41:20.016
Why now? Eat some beans,
I'll take you there later.

41:20.226 --> 41:22.501
I can't, really.
Thank you.

41:26.146 --> 41:27.420
You're a good man, Paco.

41:29.146 --> 41:32.138
- Me, a good man?
- Yes, yes.

41:32.346 --> 41:33.904
See you.

41:34.106 --> 41:36.825
Poopster!
Hasta luego.

41:37.666 --> 41:38.940
Hasta luego.

42:02.106 --> 42:04.222
Paco's beans.

42:04.626 --> 42:07.459
These are Serbian beans.

42:12.506 --> 42:15.384
Paco used to make
butter beans.

42:16.866 --> 42:20.017
His beans were hot.
These are soft.

42:20.226 --> 42:23.616
This meal is with ribs.
Would you like to try it?

42:23.826 --> 42:27.057
This one has the
right fragrance.

42:33.266 --> 42:36.224
The Uruguayans are always
afraid of the Brazilians.

42:36.426 --> 42:38.576
Even today.

42:39.082 --> 42:44.507
Interesting thing,
we were not afraid at all.

42:45.906 --> 42:49.216
Although, we didn't
know a thing about it.

42:52.666 --> 42:55.578
Get away!

43:04.146 --> 43:06.614
Where are you?

43:07.586 --> 43:08.621
Ok.

43:18.626 --> 43:20.901
What are we doing
tomorrow, coach?

43:22.346 --> 43:24.018
We're attacking.

43:26.946 --> 43:28.174
Who?

43:30.266 --> 43:31.381
Brazil.

43:36.626 --> 43:38.503
We'll attack Brazil.

44:01.586 --> 44:06.023
14 JULY 1930
BRAZIL-YUGOSLAVIA

44:34.666 --> 44:37.823
What is it, you bums?
Get lost.

44:40.706 --> 44:46.303
Cotton sheets,
absorbs sweat, right?

44:49.946 --> 44:52.062
There's none better.

44:52.306 --> 44:55.343
Maybe the Brazilians will
feel sorry for us like this...

44:55.586 --> 44:57.178
They'll beat us senseless.

44:57.426 --> 44:59.656
Wait guys, how can
we play in this?

44:59.894 --> 45:02.665
- You prefer our red jerseys, right?
- Yes, I'd play better.

45:02.906 --> 45:04.624
Are you some big shot?

45:04.826 --> 45:06.896
We'd at least have
a coat of arms.

45:07.106 --> 45:10.303
Just run. Why care about
the color of the jerseys?

45:10.626 --> 45:12.105
Gentlemen, please!

45:15.826 --> 45:18.943
What difference does the
jersey color make to you?

45:20.666 --> 45:24.102
You are not playing
for yourselves,

45:25.866 --> 45:27.060
but for your country.

45:28.746 --> 45:30.464
Play soccer.

45:32.306 --> 45:35.776
It's no shame to lose
from a team like Brazil.

45:36.226 --> 45:37.420
Remember that.

45:38.666 --> 45:39.860
Let's go, Haji.

45:51.866 --> 45:55.620
You're really funny, I swear.

46:24.946 --> 46:26.140
I shat my pants.

46:26.986 --> 46:28.738
Just don't look
at the spectators.

46:45.826 --> 46:46.861
Tell me.

46:51.426 --> 46:54.259
What are all these rags?

46:54.818 --> 46:58.038
A smuggler, huh?

47:03.396 --> 47:06.117
- Take him away!
- What are you doing?

47:06.152 --> 47:09.176
You're making a mistake, boys.

47:15.304 --> 47:16.855
That's it.

47:45.127 --> 47:47.988
I'm afraid we'll
get slammed.

47:52.467 --> 47:54.219
C'mon, warm up.

48:01.147 --> 48:04.139
Why are the journalists
going behind our goal?

48:05.427 --> 48:07.145
So they can
photograph the goals.

48:07.587 --> 48:10.233
Holy smoke, what's this?

48:17.307 --> 48:19.025
Jerseys!

48:22.427 --> 48:24.145
Jerseys!

48:25.587 --> 48:27.305
Jerseys, hey!

48:30.154 --> 48:32.252
Ok, Yugoslav, ok.

48:36.107 --> 48:38.746
Andrejka! The jerseys!
I did it!

48:41.187 --> 48:43.701
Now it's ok, huh?
A tandem.

48:44.427 --> 48:45.462
We'll see, I don't know.

48:45.747 --> 48:48.898
What do you mean, a tandem? What's
wrong with me? -You come as well.

48:49.187 --> 48:51.462
A three-bum tandem.

48:58.867 --> 49:00.858
Now we can take
some pictures.

49:04.147 --> 49:07.184
- Stanoje!
- Stanoje!

49:28.667 --> 49:30.066
Just a second Haji.

49:30.587 --> 49:32.305
What now? What are
you going to do now?

49:32.627 --> 49:34.857
Just a minute, just to close
my eyes for a second.

49:35.547 --> 49:37.265
- Will you watch the match?
- I will, I will.

49:54.987 --> 49:59.424
Poopster, why are you dressed like that,
all you need is a Serbian peasant cap.

49:59.827 --> 50:02.739
- I got one.
- God have mercy...

50:03.067 --> 50:05.103
- How are we playing?
- Do you know what the samba is?

50:05.307 --> 50:06.787
That's what they're dancing.

50:08.267 --> 50:11.657
Hey, the samba, samba.
That's samba.

50:12.867 --> 50:14.585
Let's go!

50:19.547 --> 50:21.265
Here it is!
Here it is!

50:25.987 --> 50:27.705
- Vampire!
- Not me, please.

50:28.067 --> 50:29.466
C'mon, attack!

50:29.707 --> 50:32.560
Guys...
Screw that...

50:46.067 --> 50:47.785
It's ok!
It's ok!

50:50.507 --> 50:52.225
He kicked that
through his legs?

50:52.627 --> 50:54.116
Yes, yes.

51:01.067 --> 51:02.739
Our guys are
taking the piss.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.865
For sure.

51:05.307 --> 51:06.501
That's it.

51:17.827 --> 51:19.021
Give me a smoke.

51:25.467 --> 51:27.378
Wait for him, Vampire!
Wait for him!

51:59.107 --> 52:00.301
Get closer!

52:00.547 --> 52:01.741
Don't yell.

52:05.987 --> 52:07.181
Attacker...

52:10.187 --> 52:11.905
Ballerina, take over.

52:12.507 --> 52:13.735
Get outta here.

52:15.827 --> 52:17.055
Tirke!

52:43.947 --> 52:44.857
What'd he call?

52:45.067 --> 52:50.937
Gooooooaaal!

53:20.307 --> 53:23.538
Tirke scored against the...
Brazilians?!

53:23.987 --> 53:25.261
Oh yes.

53:32.067 --> 53:37.937
What did I tell you about young Tirnanic?
You just have to let him play.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.987
Coach, let me tell you
what soccer really is...

53:41.022 --> 53:44.024
Haji, give me back
my other shoe...

53:45.547 --> 53:47.777
It can't go through,

53:47.987 --> 53:48.942
it can't!

53:53.467 --> 53:55.935
Look at them playing.

53:57.467 --> 54:00.345
They'll have to play
differently in the finale.

54:41.788 --> 54:44.063
Ok, ok, let's go...

55:01.868 --> 55:03.620
Closer to each other!

55:09.988 --> 55:12.422
Now!
Let's dance the kolo!

55:23.308 --> 55:24.423
Follow me!

56:09.588 --> 56:12.056
Gooooooooaaallll!

56:15.588 --> 56:18.341
Two goals. That's it!
History.

56:36.748 --> 56:39.820
Mr Bek...
The French school.

56:39.988 --> 56:43.264
No!
Belgrade school.

56:43.868 --> 56:46.621
I have nothing else to say
to you. Nothing. You're great.

56:47.188 --> 56:51.306
After the match we're going for
a drink, whatever happens.

56:53.228 --> 56:55.423
Let's not waste any energy.

57:02.708 --> 57:04.744
Will you be able to make it?

57:05.148 --> 57:08.504
Yes. Pass the ball to the
others, it's better.

57:13.988 --> 57:17.060
We're at the threshold of a
spectacle which the world has

57:17.628 --> 57:21.826
not seen since Charles Lindbergh's
flight over the Atlantic.

57:21.988 --> 57:24.422
We have to pass the news
to our folks in Belgrade!

57:24.628 --> 57:27.267
How do you expect me to do that?!
To send Radoje?!

57:27.468 --> 57:30.426
Let me write history now.

57:41.148 --> 57:42.900
It's starting.

58:48.268 --> 58:49.940
The great Milovan!

59:09.708 --> 59:11.585
Hey, it's a foul!

59:11.828 --> 59:13.341
Guys, I can't
take this anymore.

59:13.548 --> 59:14.822
Oh c'mon.

59:15.788 --> 59:18.860
Ballerina, how much longer?
Just another hour or two.

59:19.188 --> 59:20.382
Hour or two...!

59:28.668 --> 59:31.057
Mr. Tehada,
do you have a watch?!

59:31.496 --> 59:33.821
Ballerina! Give me the ball!
Give it to me!

59:38.188 --> 59:39.064
Tirke!

59:39.548 --> 59:41.698
C'mon, play it.

59:43.628 --> 59:45.698
Do it, come on!
Play it!

59:46.148 --> 59:47.422
C'mon, once more!

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:21.500
This is a great victory!

01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:06.835
The Yugoslav footballers who

01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:10.864
beat Brazil today are arriving!

01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:31.938
Mr. Andrejevic, I have
a reservation for you inside.

01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:33.548
Please come in.

01:01:34.509 --> 01:01:37.581
- Let's play! - No, first a drink.
- No, a dance!

01:01:41.669 --> 01:01:44.058
Well done, man!

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.061
You prince!

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:52.345
Congratulations!
I saw everything...

01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:54.420
You are an incredibly
good player.

01:01:54.749 --> 01:01:57.138
Don't tell anyone you
saw me today.

01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:59.708
You prince!

01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:02.498
Dolores.
Pain.

01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:06.027
I know what pain is.

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:09.342
You are my pain.

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:12.382
Not pain.

01:02:13.149 --> 01:02:16.898
I can be anything
for you, but not pain.

01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:20.540
Let's dance the tango.

01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:28.300
- What a celebration, eh?
- Yeah, big time.

01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:32.108
You have no idea, Poopster,
what a real celebration is.

01:02:32.629 --> 01:02:34.620
When we celebrated at home...

01:02:35.509 --> 01:02:38.501
"Blow O wind,

01:02:39.383 --> 01:02:44.312
a little from the Neretva,
a little from the Neretva, blow"...

01:02:44.347 --> 01:02:46.027
Did it blow?

01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:51.108
Yep.
It blew me away to here.

01:02:56.949 --> 01:02:59.941
Let's celebrate a little.
We won.

01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:02.949
You won, make merry.

01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:06.586
C'mon Paco,
you're one of us.

01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:11.738
We beat them, right?

01:03:27.749 --> 01:03:28.704
Guys!

01:03:30.509 --> 01:03:32.306
There will be trouble.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:48.098
I thought you are
the Antichrist.

01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:50.781
And you are...

01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:56.944
No, no, calm down.

01:03:57.189 --> 01:03:58.827
We're brothers now.

01:04:01.469 --> 01:04:05.940
Everything's ok. Congratulations
for beating Brazil!

01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:09.945
This is a celebration!

01:04:13.003 --> 01:04:15.067
Sing!
Dance!

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:17.658
Long live the
prince of soccer!

01:04:22.509 --> 01:04:24.227
Music, music!

01:04:24.709 --> 01:04:26.427
Viva Tirke!

01:04:28.989 --> 01:04:32.459
- It's ok, it's fine.
- Viva Yugoslavia.

01:04:41.989 --> 01:04:44.947
It's my birthday today.

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:49.423
- Your birthday?
- Don't tell anybody.

01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:55.658
We have to celebrate.

01:04:56.189 --> 01:04:57.702
The two of us, alone.

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:00.818
Alone?

01:05:05.149 --> 01:05:06.059
Let's go.

01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:47.705
Happy birthday.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:20.828
Happy birthday.

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:28.428
Go.
Let's go.

01:06:34.189 --> 01:06:36.100
Adios, good people!

01:06:54.429 --> 01:06:57.626
Yugoslavia's team!
One question please!

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:09.058
This is a great day for
Yugoslav football.

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:13.941
But more important is the
First World Cup in Uruguay.

01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:17.938
My congratulations to
the host nation!

01:07:19.229 --> 01:07:22.699
Thank you, we will hold a
press conference later.

01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:26.306
- Brazilians. Adios amigos!
- That's not nice.

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:29.103
- We won. - Exactly.
Have some respect.

01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:31.539
Bravo amigos!
- Bravo!

01:07:48.669 --> 01:07:50.261
Nice hotel, eh?

01:07:50.949 --> 01:07:52.905
Let's for a walk around?

01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:54.298
Ok.

01:08:04.949 --> 01:08:06.382
Ah, a goal.

01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:08.864
Hello, hello.

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:21.138
- Did you see that Tirke?
- What?

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:23.859
Marbles.
Let's thrash them!

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:25.064
Ok.

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:22.508
- Go talk to that man.
- Which man?

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:26.379
The one over there.
Ouick, it's important. I'll come soon.

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.663
- Where is Tirke?
- What's going on?

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:29.220
Never mind.
Mosa!

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.506
Jaksa! Wait!
Let's go...

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:36.109
- I'm going as well.
- Not you.

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:37.948
I said my piece.
C'mon.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:39.744
- Why not us?
- Ivica!

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:41.218
And what about us?
Batko?

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.466
- C'mon! - C'mon.
- Let's go.

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:47.720
Puslica. Let him go.
C'mon.

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:16.624
That's right.
Bravo Tirke!

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.303
Kid, you take them, I can't.

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:20.023
Ok.
This is now ours.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:21.709
Bravo.

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.145
Why should I chew gum?

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:30.898
Can't you see they're
chewing, so chew.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.749
- Let's try once again.
- Again? -Yes, once more.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.869
Kid!

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.585
I'll take your place.
There's some American guy

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.508
who trades with players.
He wants to see you.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:47.938
Why aren't you at the meeting?

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:51.182
- He's not interested.
- Then the trader doesn't know his job.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.381
Gentlemen!
Come and see this.

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.869
The Uruguayan press is
praising you to the stars.

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.949
Ovations.
Kudos to the players.

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:05.946
And listen to this - los Yugoslavos
son los Brazileros de Europa.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:07.783
You want me to translate?
Did you understand?

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.662
- I understood.
- What did you understand?

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:14.660
The Yugoslavs are the
Brazilians of Europe, right?

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.141
What are they mumbling about?

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:21.627
What's he saying?

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:23.183
Shut up.
Wait.

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.707
What's the matter,
what're you talking about?

01:13:03.710 --> 01:13:05.268
Milutin's gone, man.

01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:14.022
- Bane, come here.
- Me? Why?

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:16.744
- What about us?
- It's ok. Let's go.

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.702
Wait, man...

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:26.783
- Bravo Tirke.
- Hold him.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:38.145
Come on, the chiquita's
brother is calling you.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.908
Wait.
I'm playing.

01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:42.380
Wait?
And I left my job...

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.784
Come on,
I don't have any time to waste.

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:46.788
Besides, you can't
hold a marble like that.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.946
Give it to me.
Here, this is the way to do it.

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:51.420
Gently, gently.
There you go.

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:58.219
See you. Bye.
Kid, take them for all they're worth!

01:14:01.230 --> 01:14:03.141
Tirke! Wait!
I'm going as well!

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:37.149
- Look how they love him here.
- They love him like shit.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:41.626
He dragged us to this hole
because of his girl...

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:47.823
- Why? - When you need a woman,
you pay for one, not come here.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.187
Shut up, it's better for you.
You don't understand this.

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:53.866
As long as you understand.

01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:55.389
The assassin of Brazil!

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:04.219
Hello, Aleksandar.

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.262
What a handsome young man.

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:11.149
- Thanks. Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.339
I'll bless the table.

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:22.025
Try this, Poopster,
this is good for you.

01:15:24.071 --> 01:15:25.709
A prayer first, child.

01:15:25.911 --> 01:15:28.789
- What did he say?
- Prayer first. As it's proper.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.429
- What are you doing?
- We stand up for the prayer.

01:15:38.464 --> 01:15:40.068
Sit, you fool.

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.269
Lift your hands up, like this.

01:15:44.551 --> 01:15:48.624
Lord, we thank you for the
food we are about to receive

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:51.343
and we ask for
your protection.

01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:53.389
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:16:02.551 --> 01:16:07.022
Dear guests, friends.
My dear sister

01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:11.229
Has found the man
of her dreams.

01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:14.508
the prince of soccer,
the assassin of Brazil!

01:16:14.751 --> 01:16:17.663
He says he's happy she's
finally found a real man

01:16:18.551 --> 01:16:19.540
and an assassin...

01:16:20.431 --> 01:16:22.228
Assassino?

01:16:22.471 --> 01:16:24.382
- Assassino de Brazil.
- The assassin of Brazil.

01:16:26.111 --> 01:16:29.626
The happiness of my Dolores
is my happiness as well...

01:16:29.911 --> 01:16:33.028
Her happiness is also his happiness.
He said that nicely.

01:16:33.271 --> 01:16:36.820
And when the Mundial finishes, and
with the blessing of the Virgin Mary,

01:16:36.991 --> 01:16:39.664
You'll play for the
great Penarol!

01:16:40.191 --> 01:16:41.943
I'll see to that.

01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:46.184
- What about Penarol? - And when the Mundial
finishes, you'll play for Penarol.

01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:50.585
Why Penarol?
The Nacional is better.

01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:54.147
What the hell are you saying?
What frigging Nacional?

01:16:54.391 --> 01:16:58.430
- Joke,joke!
- Ah, a joke.

01:17:05.191 --> 01:17:08.388
And finally,
you will stay here with us.

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:13.669
When the Mundial finishes,
you, my friend, will live here with them.

01:17:15.271 --> 01:17:18.104
For the start, you will share
a room with granma Julia.

01:17:18.431 --> 01:17:20.581
For the beginning,
a room with granma.

01:17:20.831 --> 01:17:22.503
But when the granma
decides to leave us...

01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:25.470
- I won't leave you.
- When the granma decides to leave us,

01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:27.070
it'll be all yours.

01:17:27.271 --> 01:17:29.102
I won't leave because
I won't die.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.383
- Granma, shut up!
- I won't die!

01:17:34.191 --> 01:17:40.027
She won't die...
and he is very angry.

01:17:40.471 --> 01:17:42.860
They are arguing now.
Arguing a lot.

01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:46.143
- Don't screw with me!
- Go to hell, you old hag!

01:17:46.431 --> 01:17:49.901
Like shit she'll ever die,
just look at her eat.

01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:57.614
- What did she say?
- In short... you're fucked.

01:19:25.991 --> 01:19:28.551
ATTENTION!
FORBIDDEN ZONE!

01:19:55.351 --> 01:19:59.904
Sir! Sir!
You're not allowed here.

01:20:08.811 --> 01:20:10.131
Sir...

01:20:12.418 --> 01:20:14.971
Sir...
This is very dangerous.

01:20:15.296 --> 01:20:16.800
Please go back.

01:20:19.033 --> 01:20:21.355
Sir, do you understand me?

01:20:22.434 --> 01:20:24.134
Go back.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.008
What is this place?

01:20:28.605 --> 01:20:31.331
Long time ago was
the beautiful village.

01:20:31.597 --> 01:20:35.636
Before this terrible disease took over.
Now it's the ghost town.

01:20:35.893 --> 01:20:39.007
This children are very sick.
You can get infected.

01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:41.136
You should leave.

01:20:49.718 --> 01:20:51.943
- But they love football.
- Yes.

01:20:52.686 --> 01:20:56.439
They love football.
And they love life.

01:22:23.831 --> 01:22:25.948
Gooooaaalllll!
Mosaaaa!

01:22:26.192 --> 01:22:28.262
17 JULY 1930
YUGOSLAVIA-BOLIVIA

01:22:55.432 --> 01:22:58.185
- Mosa's back!
- Bravo Marjanovic!

01:23:02.272 --> 01:23:05.264
That's it Ballerina!
Pass it to me!

01:23:05.512 --> 01:23:07.423
Ballerina!
Pass the ball!

01:23:08.992 --> 01:23:10.345
Pass the ball, Ballerina!

01:23:15.432 --> 01:23:19.869
Monsieur Rimet, you said you
wouldn't come to the match.

01:23:20.352 --> 01:23:24.823
I thought it wasn't important,
but now I think it will be decisive.

01:23:25.112 --> 01:23:28.661
France and Rumania finished competing,
and they're going home.

01:23:28.912 --> 01:23:32.188
- Is that a problem?
- It shouldn't be

01:23:33.352 --> 01:23:35.343
if Yugoslavia beats Bolivia.

01:23:36.392 --> 01:23:40.146
The honor of European football is in
your hands. Are you aware of that?

01:23:41.232 --> 01:23:42.745
Pass it, go on.

01:23:42.992 --> 01:23:47.941
FIFA will have huge problems if only
the local clubs are in the semi-finals.

01:23:49.952 --> 01:23:53.865
Without Europe in the semi-finals,
mon dieu, we are...

01:24:08.072 --> 01:24:10.381
Let's stop defending ourselves
and pass the ball!

01:24:10.592 --> 01:24:13.026
Pass it to me.
He's not playing well!

01:24:20.112 --> 01:24:22.182
Can't you see I'm all alone!

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:24.787
- It's good!
- What's good, are you nuts?

01:24:41.072 --> 01:24:42.221
Ballerina!

01:24:44.192 --> 01:24:46.467
I don't understand him.

01:24:48.512 --> 01:24:50.867
Tirke, pass it to me, man.

01:24:58.232 --> 01:24:59.711
Ivica!
Pass it!

01:25:05.592 --> 01:25:09.301
Don't worry sir.
I think we will win.

01:25:10.112 --> 01:25:11.591
I hope so.

01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:21.669
When ever did you pass
it to me? When?

01:25:21.872 --> 01:25:24.432
You need to pass it to me,
I'm the offence.

01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:28.422
People, bravo! Bravo!
Excellent first half-time!

01:25:28.752 --> 01:25:32.188
Just please don't be so selfish, guys.
Pass the ball a little.

01:25:32.472 --> 01:25:35.782
- I told Ballerina.
- You again Ballerina, huh?

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:37.706
It's ok, everything's alright.

01:25:37.912 --> 01:25:41.268
Let's go now, the second half. Let's
give a goal as soon as possible.

01:25:41.472 --> 01:25:42.951
And then go back,
let's keep even.

01:25:43.192 --> 01:25:46.707
This guy's crazy. That means I
have to give at least two goals.

01:25:48.952 --> 01:25:51.147
The coach is speaking.

01:25:51.352 --> 01:25:54.071
- I am sorry.
- Let's go! Be smart.

01:25:58.672 --> 01:26:01.232
...shoot at 16, whatever.

01:26:09.312 --> 01:26:10.791
It's iiiiiin...

01:26:29.992 --> 01:26:32.950
That's it, just kick it!

01:26:33.152 --> 01:26:36.349
- Why didn't you pass it, man?
- Sorry, I have to give another goal.

01:26:42.672 --> 01:26:44.947
- Give it! Give it!
- To me Ballerina!

01:27:17.912 --> 01:27:20.380
I'll do it!
Move, I'll do it!

01:27:20.592 --> 01:27:23.425
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure, go away,

01:27:54.432 --> 01:27:56.024
Prince!

01:27:56.232 --> 01:27:57.426
Prince!

01:28:11.432 --> 01:28:14.026
We're in the semi-finals.

01:28:14.232 --> 01:28:19.784
You're the only one who wasn't worried.
- Now I am worried, Andrej.

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:28.227
Guys, we didn't play
like the coach told us to.

01:28:28.432 --> 01:28:31.344
No, we played much better.

01:28:32.352 --> 01:28:38.302
The Yugoslav national team has done
more than any other Imperial power.

01:28:38.512 --> 01:28:41.185
They conquered Uruguay.

01:28:46.192 --> 01:28:49.867
Our boys, as real ambassadors
of sport impress with their manners

01:28:50.072 --> 01:28:54.111
in meeting with the jet
set of Montevideo.

01:28:54.352 --> 01:28:57.583
Milovan!
Milovan the great!

01:29:01.152 --> 01:29:02.585
You're overdressed.

01:29:07.952 --> 01:29:10.625
Hey Ballerina... they'll
take your pants off...

01:29:38.353 --> 01:29:41.470
What is this man
doing with our players...

01:29:44.993 --> 01:29:48.952
We have, as our guest, the new star
of the Mundial Aleksandar Tirnanic.

01:29:49.553 --> 01:29:51.908
How do you feel as a star?

01:29:52.753 --> 01:29:56.143
Now everyone knows about Yugoslavia!
That's the most important thing.

01:29:56.393 --> 01:30:01.592
- You became a star nonetheless?
- I'm just a part of the team.

01:30:01.793 --> 01:30:05.547
- We heard that you will become a player
of our Penarol team? - Is that true?

01:30:07.393 --> 01:30:10.032
I'm not thinking about Penarol.

01:30:11.153 --> 01:30:13.713
I'm interested only
in the Mundial.

01:30:13.913 --> 01:30:19.271
- Could you live here and play football?
- I don't know... I am a Serb...

01:30:19.473 --> 01:30:21.384
I don't think so...

01:32:07.433 --> 01:32:10.630
Tirke!
What are you doing?

01:32:12.513 --> 01:32:14.947
I am waiting for Dolores.

01:32:30.313 --> 01:32:33.146
Tirke, where were you?
I was waiting for you.

01:32:33.433 --> 01:32:35.708
What do you care...

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.347
I was worried.

01:32:42.953 --> 01:32:45.467
You don't have to
worry about me.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:48.747
I can do that myself.

01:32:54.233 --> 01:32:57.589
- He's not well, eh?
- That was yesterday.

01:32:57.833 --> 01:33:01.030
- What?
- He wasn't well yesterday.

01:33:01.753 --> 01:33:04.267
Now it's a casastrophe.

01:33:06.633 --> 01:33:09.591
- You mean catastrophe.
- Yes, that.

01:33:33.913 --> 01:33:36.427
You'd stay?

01:33:41.873 --> 01:33:43.625
Why not?

01:33:45.793 --> 01:33:48.090
I found a girl who loves me.

01:33:48.569 --> 01:33:52.737
I found a club where I can play,
to earn money.

01:33:54.593 --> 01:33:56.424
And the team?

01:33:56.673 --> 01:34:00.905
Where's the team? The American offered
a few bucks and everything's screwed up.

01:34:07.833 --> 01:34:10.347
Maybe here I
could be happy.

01:34:14.593 --> 01:34:17.107
Have you ever
seen a happy man?

01:34:20.473 --> 01:34:22.941
You were the first
who wanted to stay.

01:34:26.753 --> 01:34:30.029
Now maybe you will be
the only one who'll return.

01:35:11.273 --> 01:35:13.741
Holy smoke.
Is this for us?

01:35:14.513 --> 01:35:18.108
- Probably. - I don't want any.
Who knows how much it costs here.

01:35:18.393 --> 01:35:21.271
Yes, but they can take
it from the contract.

01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:23.185
But if they open it...

01:35:23.713 --> 01:35:27.752
- Boys, would you like some champagne?
- No, thank you!

01:35:31.953 --> 01:35:33.909
Some champagne,
little Romanian?

01:35:34.153 --> 01:35:38.066
I'm not crazy to pay for that.
It's pricey.

01:35:39.073 --> 01:35:40.472
Pricey.

01:35:43.793 --> 01:35:47.069
- The Romanian's tightfisted.
- And we are not?

01:37:13.274 --> 01:37:16.869
You champion!

01:37:24.994 --> 01:37:28.623
Why didn't you come?
I waited for you.

01:37:30.554 --> 01:37:33.193
You shouldn't have come.

01:37:37.474 --> 01:37:41.626
What's going on Dolores? Is someone dead?
Granma Julia is alive?

01:37:42.074 --> 01:37:45.669
Alive! Can't you hear
what he's saying?

01:37:45.874 --> 01:37:49.230
I'm alive, I'm alive.
I won't die.

01:37:49.594 --> 01:37:52.108
Let's go.

01:37:59.794 --> 01:38:02.262
Wait. Dolores,
I don't understand anything.

01:38:02.994 --> 01:38:06.907
What don't you understand? You don't want
to get married, you don't want Uruguay,

01:38:07.394 --> 01:38:10.704
you don't want Penarol, because
you don't love Dolores.

01:38:12.274 --> 01:38:14.344
Wait Dolores.

01:38:14.794 --> 01:38:16.944
I love you.

01:38:22.074 --> 01:38:24.110
I will go with him.

01:38:26.994 --> 01:38:29.827
Ok, I'm going with you.

01:38:34.674 --> 01:38:38.952
No, no. We're not going to town.
Go over there.

01:38:59.594 --> 01:39:03.064
This is where my mother jumped
from and killed herself...

01:39:05.634 --> 01:39:07.431
She was abandoned.

01:39:09.634 --> 01:39:11.226
I don't understand.

01:39:15.154 --> 01:39:16.746
She was all alone.

01:39:17.594 --> 01:39:20.825
The man she loved left

01:39:21.954 --> 01:39:24.184
and took her life with him.

01:39:28.074 --> 01:39:29.905
I will never leave you.

01:39:32.114 --> 01:39:33.706
I won't.

01:41:47.314 --> 01:41:50.624
22 JULY 1930
SEMI-FINAL DRAW

01:41:52.194 --> 01:41:53.786
Can I help?

01:41:54.114 --> 01:41:58.551
The radio, please.
To play in the semi-finals.

01:41:58.994 --> 01:42:00.666
The semi-finals.

01:42:01.194 --> 01:42:04.345
I hope we'll beat
the Argentinians.

01:42:04.714 --> 01:42:06.227
Let's hear who
we're playing against.

01:42:06.434 --> 01:42:07.423
Vampire!

01:42:08.154 --> 01:42:11.749
Tell Bane I found great
shoes, only 150 dollars.

01:42:11.994 --> 01:42:16.510
- I don't know if they have my size.
- Sure they have.

01:42:17.434 --> 01:42:21.473
And now the president of FIFA, Jules Rimet,
is going to proceed to the draw.

01:42:21.914 --> 01:42:24.951
In a few seconds we will
know the rivals of the matches.

01:42:25.874 --> 01:42:28.388
- Good morning.
- Hello.

01:42:28.874 --> 01:42:31.593
Give him a good helping.
Look how skinny he is.

01:42:32.074 --> 01:42:34.713
Granma, he's a soccer player,
he can't gain weight.

01:42:34.914 --> 01:42:37.633
I don't care about soccer,
I want grandkids.

01:42:37.994 --> 01:42:40.030
Good morning, granny.

01:42:40.314 --> 01:42:46.150
Boy, sit down and eat.
I want grandkids.

01:42:48.434 --> 01:42:53.064
The first semi-finalist is the
national team of Uruguay.

01:42:55.514 --> 01:42:57.072
Did you take care
of the goats?

01:42:57.314 --> 01:42:58.110
Yes, yes granma.

01:42:58.354 --> 01:43:02.233
- Did you take care of the goats or not?
- Leave me alone.

01:43:02.714 --> 01:43:05.865
And against Uruguay in the first match
of the semi-finals will be...

01:43:06.714 --> 01:43:10.024
The national team
of Yugoslavia!

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:12.622
What luck...

01:43:12.834 --> 01:43:14.108
Fucking hell!

01:43:14.314 --> 01:43:16.908
- Hey, we'll crush them to pieces.
- Yugoslavia!

01:43:19.154 --> 01:43:21.224
Yugoslavia - Uruguay.

01:43:21.554 --> 01:43:22.873
Ok, ok.

01:43:23.354 --> 01:43:25.868
Uruguay is good in soccer.

01:43:26.114 --> 01:43:27.547
Uruguay is the best.

01:43:28.874 --> 01:43:30.068
Yugoslavia is good as well.

01:43:30.314 --> 01:43:33.909
- Yugoslavia will lose.
- It will be 5-0.

01:43:34.154 --> 01:43:35.873
God willing...

01:43:36.805 --> 01:43:42.013
we should all play like one.
Yugoslavia will win, it's possible.

01:43:44.835 --> 01:43:48.953
Look son-in-law, you're no
longer with Yugoslavia.

01:43:49.555 --> 01:43:52.592
- Kike, let's eat. Calm down.
- I'm calm.

01:43:54.355 --> 01:43:57.506
You're ours, you
are with Uruguay.

01:43:58.275 --> 01:44:02.746
It's the Mundial now,
I am Yugoslavia.

01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:06.790
- No, you won't play.
- Kike, calm down.

01:44:09.315 --> 01:44:14.833
Please. Calm down, sit down so I can explain
something to you. I'll explain, calm down.

01:44:16.715 --> 01:44:20.310
Kike, it's not a
good moment, stop it.

01:44:21.195 --> 01:44:24.790
Shut up! Stop it.
What's wrong with you?!

01:44:26.275 --> 01:44:29.870
Kike, you're crazy!

01:44:31.195 --> 01:44:35.746
Leave the boy alone! Calm down,
you ruin everything you touch.

01:44:35.995 --> 01:44:37.474
- Kike, you're crazy!
- Get into the house!

01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:40.109
You heard Kike,
there's no way out.

01:44:40.435 --> 01:44:44.872
We're playing the World Cup semi-finals in
2 days... and our team is falling apart.

01:44:45.755 --> 01:44:50.510
Mosa, find Tirnanic, wherever he is.
I want him in the hotel.

01:44:51.435 --> 01:44:53.426
What kind of fuck-up
is this, by God...

01:44:53.915 --> 01:44:56.270
Ok Milutinac, enough of
the speeches already.

01:44:56.515 --> 01:44:58.506
Say it again,
I didn't hear you.

01:44:59.075 --> 01:45:00.428
Ok, stop it now, really.

01:45:00.675 --> 01:45:02.666
Do you want to hear a
speech from me? Huh Sekulic?

01:45:02.915 --> 01:45:04.189
C'mon, c'mon!

01:45:04.435 --> 01:45:06.471
- What is it Ballerina?
- Why are you getting involved?

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:10.748
Easy! Take it easy guys! Keep
your strength for the semi-finals.

01:45:11.755 --> 01:45:13.393
Semi-finals!

01:45:14.115 --> 01:45:16.106
Do you understand
what that means?

01:45:17.995 --> 01:45:23.023
Let's go! Make two teams.
C'mon guys!

01:45:23.955 --> 01:45:25.946
- That's it! - Ballerina,
don't come with us.

01:45:28.235 --> 01:45:30.226
I won't.

01:45:31.715 --> 01:45:35.833
- Now you'll pass the ball to
me, and I'll... - Ok, slowly.

01:45:35.955 --> 01:45:37.468
Mosa, you're with them.

01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:40.947
No Bek, I'm with you. Somebody has
to be the captain on the tour.

01:45:41.595 --> 01:45:43.711
You didn't really
think it would be you?

01:45:43.915 --> 01:45:46.270
Are you going with us?

01:45:46.475 --> 01:45:48.625
- Yes, am I in the way?
- How could you be in the way?

01:45:48.835 --> 01:45:51.474
Now I feel much better. -If it's
easier for you, go to the goal.

01:45:51.675 --> 01:45:54.633
Look at Mosa...
he has betrayed us.

01:45:54.835 --> 01:45:57.144
- Did you sign the contract?
- I did, for more money.

01:45:57.355 --> 01:46:00.427
- You sold your soul.
- Boys, the ball for me!

01:46:01.275 --> 01:46:04.187
And no more than
two contacts!

01:46:09.835 --> 01:46:11.507
Easier, easier, hey!

01:46:12.675 --> 01:46:15.269
Vampire! -What's with you Vampire?
Are you nuts?

01:46:15.475 --> 01:46:17.033
- It's ok, hey.
- Don't, guys.

01:46:18.995 --> 01:46:21.111
What is it doggy?
How's the grass?

01:46:25.315 --> 01:46:26.430
What's this?
Hey!

01:46:26.635 --> 01:46:28.785
Wait a little, you fool.
The man's hurt.

01:46:28.995 --> 01:46:30.792
- Did I ask you anything?
- Pirate!

01:46:32.795 --> 01:46:34.706
What is it?

01:46:34.915 --> 01:46:36.394
Jaksic?!

01:46:36.595 --> 01:46:38.472
- Sorry.
- Enough! Let's go!

01:46:38.675 --> 01:46:40.108
Don't be scared.

01:46:40.315 --> 01:46:44.547
Back home, they called me
"Miljenko the Cat".

01:46:44.755 --> 01:46:47.223
I'm going to fuck these...

01:46:50.235 --> 01:46:52.226
What do you want?

01:46:52.435 --> 01:46:55.666
Where is the football player?
The Serbian?

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:57.103
Tirke!

01:46:57.315 --> 01:46:58.828
What does it matter to you?

01:46:58.995 --> 01:47:00.951
I am responsible for him.

01:47:07.235 --> 01:47:09.305
Tirke is now my responsibility.

01:47:09.515 --> 01:47:12.268
He is my borther-in-law
and he's not going anywhere.

01:47:14.835 --> 01:47:16.154
I want to see him.

01:47:16.355 --> 01:47:18.744
Go now, motherfucker!

01:47:18.955 --> 01:47:21.594
Go!
And don't come back!

01:47:22.995 --> 01:47:25.065
- Milutinac, do you want to
drink with us? - No, thanks.

01:47:25.275 --> 01:47:28.711
- Come, sit with us.
- I'll sit there.

01:47:34.155 --> 01:47:36.191
Hey, what's wrong, kod?

01:47:37.755 --> 01:47:39.313
Guys,

01:47:39.515 --> 01:47:43.224
- Pooper stays with me.
- What happened?

01:48:11.915 --> 01:48:14.668
I brought something
for you to eat.

01:48:14.875 --> 01:48:16.786
Do you want it?

01:48:16.995 --> 01:48:18.713
Dolores,

01:48:18.915 --> 01:48:20.473
I have to go.

01:48:21.675 --> 01:48:23.586
Eat.

01:48:23.795 --> 01:48:26.389
Dolores, the match,
the semi-finals.

01:48:27.955 --> 01:48:29.786
Just a match.

01:48:29.995 --> 01:48:31.747
It's just a match.

01:48:31.955 --> 01:48:33.946
Everything will be ok.

01:48:34.155 --> 01:48:36.225
No, nothing will be ok.

01:48:36.435 --> 01:48:37.948
Everything's ok.

01:48:38.195 --> 01:48:40.151
No, you don't
understand anything.

01:48:40.355 --> 01:48:43.108
I know my brother is crazy,

01:48:43.315 --> 01:48:44.668
I know.

01:48:44.875 --> 01:48:47.025
But after we
can be together.

01:48:56.075 --> 01:48:58.953
Marriage.

01:48:59.195 --> 01:49:00.389
Yes,

01:49:00.595 --> 01:49:03.189
but I must play.

01:49:03.395 --> 01:49:05.704
Do you understand?
I must play.

01:49:05.915 --> 01:49:07.348
Play?

01:49:07.555 --> 01:49:10.069
A match is more important
to you than my love?

01:49:10.275 --> 01:49:13.745
No, soccer is my life,
do you understand?

01:49:13.955 --> 01:49:15.832
And what am I in your life?
Nothing?

01:49:15.995 --> 01:49:17.667
No, there's no dilemma.

01:49:17.875 --> 01:49:20.833
What do you mean? You said
you'd stay, that you love me.

01:49:20.995 --> 01:49:25.432
You said you'd stay,
and I told you to go!

01:49:25.635 --> 01:49:28.388
You lied, you're no prince!

01:49:28.595 --> 01:49:30.153
You're all crazy!

01:49:30.355 --> 01:49:31.504
Ok, do you want to go?

01:49:31.715 --> 01:49:36.630
Go then! I don't want to see
you anymore! Leave!

01:49:55.795 --> 01:49:59.947
You are crazy.
You are all crazy!

01:50:28.275 --> 01:50:29.947
- You will go this way...
- Wait!

01:50:30.195 --> 01:50:34.393
- No you'll go with us.
- Ballerina goes with us.

01:50:34.595 --> 01:50:36.551
Jaksic, you and Bane...

01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:39.110
No problem, if we get killed...

01:50:39.315 --> 01:50:42.388
The professionals
have to look out...

01:50:42.596 --> 01:50:44.552
Get down!

01:50:59.116 --> 01:51:02.426
The truck...
it's going away!

01:51:10.996 --> 01:51:12.714
Where did this
guy come from?!

01:51:15.316 --> 01:51:16.635
Hands up!

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:19.589
- Who are you?
- The Yugoslav team.

01:51:35.796 --> 01:51:37.275
Handsome young man.

01:51:40.956 --> 01:51:42.674
Where are the other players?

01:51:42.876 --> 01:51:44.832
Where?!
Speak up!

01:51:48.756 --> 01:51:50.712
Fuck you...

01:51:54.996 --> 01:51:58.147
Don't move!
Don't move.

01:51:58.356 --> 01:52:00.312
If you move, I'll kill you.

01:52:04.076 --> 01:52:05.794
Tie them up!

01:52:10.996 --> 01:52:13.669
Where is Tirke?

01:52:17.276 --> 01:52:19.153
Dolores!
Are you crazy?

01:52:30.876 --> 01:52:32.150
Let's go!

01:52:46.636 --> 01:52:48.274
You're dead now.

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:52.664
How dare you come
into my house?

01:52:54.716 --> 01:52:56.069
Into my own house?!

01:53:08.636 --> 01:53:10.433
Put your hands down, morons!

01:53:11.996 --> 01:53:14.590
Ballerina is not good
enough for you?

01:53:14.796 --> 01:53:16.115
We are the champions!

01:53:18.876 --> 01:53:20.867
We are the champions,
you motherfucker!

01:53:24.756 --> 01:53:26.747
What are you?

01:53:28.996 --> 01:53:30.634
Football players?

01:53:31.876 --> 01:53:33.229
Or criminals?

01:53:34.796 --> 01:53:37.708
You don't deserve to play
against Uruguay.

01:53:40.316 --> 01:53:41.874
Don't move!

01:53:42.076 --> 01:53:44.032
Don't move, or I'll kill you!

01:53:45.436 --> 01:53:47.870
I swear to God I'll kill you!

01:54:09.156 --> 01:54:12.228
That's enough!

01:54:13.636 --> 01:54:16.946
Kike... let the boys go.

01:54:18.196 --> 01:54:21.825
I've had enough of you
and your football!

01:54:25.356 --> 01:54:27.108
You can't force
someone to love.

01:54:31.996 --> 01:54:35.784
I'm sorry.
You are one very wise lady.

01:54:35.996 --> 01:54:38.635
Thank you very much.

01:54:40.636 --> 01:54:42.115
Handsome young man.

01:54:45.236 --> 01:54:47.466
Let's go, before they
change their minds.

01:55:06.996 --> 01:55:08.748
Good bye, prince.

01:55:31.276 --> 01:55:35.896
27 JULY 1930
URUGUAY-YUGOSLAVIA, CENTENARIO

01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:46.713
The press, the press.

01:55:46.916 --> 01:55:50.306
I don't understand what you want,
Zivkovic? To send a report?

01:55:50.516 --> 01:55:52.711
You don't have to
understand anything.

01:55:52.916 --> 01:55:56.272
Someone over there
doesn't trust my professional reports.

01:55:56.476 --> 01:55:58.671
- They do have trust.
- Please don't talk.

01:55:58.876 --> 01:56:03.313
The King and the Yugoslav government
asked me personally for a report.

01:56:03.516 --> 01:56:05.108
There, that's all.

01:56:05.316 --> 01:56:07.705
The King and the
government of Yugoslavia.

01:56:07.916 --> 01:56:09.065
Yugoslavia!?

01:56:09.276 --> 01:56:12.074
- Italy!
- Italy.

01:56:14.996 --> 01:56:17.954
We have tickets.
I paid 100 pesos.

01:56:18.276 --> 01:56:21.473
We have 20.000 people
with tickets and no seats!

01:56:21.716 --> 01:56:23.832
- Now what, sir?
- Watch from here.

01:56:23.996 --> 01:56:25.145
Sir...

01:56:25.516 --> 01:56:28.633
The boy can't see from here...
he's small!

01:56:34.436 --> 01:56:36.108
- Good?
- Good... good!

01:56:37.996 --> 01:56:39.714
Did you see how big he is?

01:56:41.996 --> 01:56:44.066
Back home, I threw guys
like this in the river.

01:57:41.276 --> 01:57:42.550
It's like a whole
city is here.

01:57:48.597 --> 01:57:50.110
Let's warm up a little.

01:57:53.837 --> 01:57:55.236
I'm already dripping wet.

01:58:10.997 --> 01:58:13.716
I've never experienced
anything like this before.

01:58:15.277 --> 01:58:17.188
This is nothing.
We're playing football.

01:59:02.837 --> 01:59:05.715
Bravo Jaksa you devil!

01:59:35.877 --> 01:59:39.631
Goooooooaaaaallll!

01:59:42.477 --> 01:59:44.149
Uncle Bora loves you!

01:59:44.437 --> 01:59:45.756
Bravo boys, bravo!

01:59:45.957 --> 01:59:47.629
What are we going to
do now Uruguayans?!

01:59:57.917 --> 01:59:59.589
Police, please.

02:00:00.597 --> 02:00:04.476
Sing like our Serbian heroes
did when they beat the Turks!

02:00:04.677 --> 02:00:06.349
English, English Bora...

02:00:06.557 --> 02:00:08.229
- I can't help it...
- Bravo!

02:00:15.277 --> 02:00:16.949
C'mon Uruguay!

02:00:38.997 --> 02:00:40.191
C'mon!
C'mon!

02:00:41.957 --> 02:00:43.629
That's it!
Very good!

02:00:46.677 --> 02:00:48.349
Referee?

02:00:48.837 --> 02:00:49.952
What is happening?

02:00:50.157 --> 02:00:51.715
That's a good
referee, who is he?

02:00:51.917 --> 02:00:55.796
- A Brazilian! - He's a gentleman,
you can see that immediately.

02:01:00.797 --> 02:01:01.946
Why are they complaining?
That was clearly an offside.

02:01:02.197 --> 02:01:04.791
They will gripe
until they win.

02:01:04.997 --> 02:01:06.350
- It was an offside!
- Are you crazy?

02:01:41.397 --> 02:01:44.195
- Are you in your right minds, people?
- Put your head down.

02:01:53.477 --> 02:01:56.196
If we give another goal,
they will shoot us.

02:01:56.997 --> 02:01:58.669
Fuck them, let's play.

02:02:00.997 --> 02:02:04.114
What are you doing there?
C'mon, get out of there.

02:02:37.277 --> 02:02:38.949
Very good!

02:02:46.637 --> 02:02:48.673
Offside!
Offside!

02:02:59.597 --> 02:03:01.269
Hey referee,
that was an offside!

02:03:01.477 --> 02:03:03.149
That's not a goal!
That was an offside!

02:03:05.597 --> 02:03:08.953
I told you, didn't I?
I know these Brazilian crooks.

02:03:09.997 --> 02:03:11.510
It was an offside,
why didn't he call it?

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:13.389
Didn't he call it?

02:03:16.797 --> 02:03:18.469
An offside as big as a house!

02:03:19.557 --> 02:03:21.548
You see how he shat his
pants from the Uruguayans.

02:03:29.997 --> 02:03:31.715
They killed the guy.

02:03:38.997 --> 02:03:40.715
Call it then!

02:03:45.417 --> 02:03:46.904
Look what they're
doing with us!

02:03:47.131 --> 02:03:50.019
Do these guys want to kill
us or beat us? What is this?

02:04:27.597 --> 02:04:29.827
We have a big problem!

02:04:36.117 --> 02:04:37.948
We can't beat them.

02:04:40.997 --> 02:04:42.794
What's this guy whistling for?

02:04:42.997 --> 02:04:45.591
What? A foul?
What foul?!

02:04:50.118 --> 02:04:52.188
People, is this possible?

02:04:52.798 --> 02:04:55.028
The frigging robbing prick.

02:04:55.278 --> 02:04:56.347
They annulled the goal.

02:04:56.958 --> 02:04:57.754
Is this guy nuts?

02:04:57.998 --> 02:05:03.576
I'll find you anywhere. Just watch
when I start refereeing...!

02:05:05.638 --> 02:05:10.871
Come here so I can clobber you!
You prick!

02:05:11.998 --> 02:05:13.829
Scandal!

02:05:14.278 --> 02:05:19.955
Referee, in civilized countries
there's a prison sentence for this!

02:05:21.358 --> 02:05:23.189
Milutinac. Fucking hell...

02:05:23.398 --> 02:05:26.071
- Easy. - You bastard... - Easy what?
- Please, what's going on?

02:05:26.278 --> 02:05:27.188
I can't look at this.

02:05:31.918 --> 02:05:34.068
What does he say, Milutinac?

02:05:36.998 --> 02:05:40.513
- It's finished, boys.
- What's finished?

02:05:44.078 --> 02:05:46.353
Gentleman, the last warning!

02:05:48.525 --> 02:05:51.547
Come on now,
call your king and government,

02:05:51.886 --> 02:05:54.604
fatherland and the military!
Look what they're doing to us!

02:07:06.718 --> 02:07:08.834
What's this? What did the
idiot whistle for?! Goal?

02:07:09.358 --> 02:07:13.146
- What goal? - It's not a goal!
- Is he crazy? - Who's crazy?

02:07:13.638 --> 02:07:16.914
History will judge you,
people, are you crazy?

02:07:21.238 --> 02:07:24.355
- Hey man, what is it, are you a cop or a
football player? - You stupid cop pig...

02:07:24.558 --> 02:07:28.710
- Ballerina, ok, he'll arrest us all.
- So let him arrest us!

02:07:34.398 --> 02:07:35.911
Grab him!

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:42.276
Cook him in tomato sauce...
And add some garlic!

02:07:42.718 --> 02:07:45.915
Bravo! Now I'll give a goal!
Look, now I'm going to give a goal!

02:07:46.349 --> 02:07:51.283
Take me away so I don't have
to watch this! Uruguay!

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.836
History willjudge you!

02:07:55.118 --> 02:07:57.632
You can say that now in Serbian.
What a fuck-up!

02:07:58.438 --> 02:08:01.316
Fuck all of you.

02:08:10.198 --> 02:08:12.314
Goddamn to hell!

02:08:16.718 --> 02:08:20.267
To the field, guys. Please!
To the half-time.

02:08:22.358 --> 02:08:25.794
I'll see what I can do.
Please! Let's go!

02:08:26.278 --> 02:08:30.635
- Yugoslavia! Go on, play ball!
- C'mon boys!

02:08:32.198 --> 02:08:35.907
Milutinac!

02:08:40.478 --> 02:08:43.197
Take the captain's
armband, Milutinac!

02:08:54.598 --> 02:08:58.477
C'mon Poopster!
Screw this.

02:09:13.198 --> 02:09:15.951
- Sir, you cannot enter!
- Move!

02:09:31.518 --> 02:09:33.827
Monsieur Rimet!

02:09:33.998 --> 02:09:35.351
Come in!

02:09:38.238 --> 02:09:39.557
What's happening
Monsieur Rimet?

02:09:39.758 --> 02:09:41.828
We made it.
You, me, all of us!

02:09:42.238 --> 02:09:44.706
Soccer is becoming
the future of the world.

02:09:45.398 --> 02:09:47.150
This is the future for you?

02:09:49.078 --> 02:09:50.147
Listen to me!

02:09:50.638 --> 02:09:52.230
You can't see the
forest from the trees.

02:09:52.438 --> 02:09:53.427
We made it.

02:09:53.638 --> 02:09:57.028
We did more than was expected.
And we can do more.

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.949
I expect help from you too.

02:10:44.158 --> 02:10:46.228
They really smashed us.

02:10:51.918 --> 02:10:55.354
Do you also think that
we shouldn't go back to the field?

02:10:58.238 --> 02:11:01.913
I decided today to say
goodbye to soccer.

02:11:10.518 --> 02:11:12.031
I'll miss it.

02:11:14.638 --> 02:11:17.436
But I'll miss you even more.

02:11:24.518 --> 02:11:26.713
If you go out on the field now,

02:11:27.558 --> 02:11:29.788
a great injustice
is waiting for you.

02:11:36.598 --> 02:11:38.589
An unjust defeat.

02:11:40.278 --> 02:11:41.791
But I would like

02:11:45.198 --> 02:11:48.508
to go through this
last lesson together

02:11:50.478 --> 02:11:52.515
while we're still a team.

02:11:58.999 --> 02:12:03.709
In your lives, you will face a lot
of injustice and many failures.

02:12:05.439 --> 02:12:07.509
but you will be alone.

02:12:08.759 --> 02:12:11.114
All this must be
gone through.

02:12:16.799 --> 02:12:20.314
This is how boys
become men, kids.

02:12:28.199 --> 02:12:29.712
I'll be on the bench.

02:12:52.719 --> 02:12:53.947
Let's go.

02:13:14.159 --> 02:13:18.232
I'd like to see them again.

02:13:20.959 --> 02:13:23.189
I believe there is a place

02:13:24.399 --> 02:13:25.912
where we'll meet again.

02:13:30.999 --> 02:13:35.550
Take this, take it over there.
When God didn't let me have it...

02:13:37.999 --> 02:13:41.230
Others wrote about
all this too, but

02:13:43.919 --> 02:13:45.830
no one knows the real end.

02:13:48.639 --> 02:13:50.152
I know.

02:13:58.639 --> 02:14:01.870
30 JULY 1930.
LAST DAY OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP

02:14:02.959 --> 02:14:05.598
- What does it say?
- It congratulates us for third place.

02:14:16.519 --> 02:14:18.191
Let's go, people, we
will really be late.

02:14:27.759 --> 02:14:29.272
They really think
they'd beat us.

02:14:29.479 --> 02:14:30.958
Tell them they're nuts.

02:14:31.399 --> 02:14:33.708
You won't even accept
the medals with us?

02:14:33.919 --> 02:14:35.432
We don't want to
be late for the bus.

02:14:36.879 --> 02:14:38.392
Ok, guys.

02:14:39.079 --> 02:14:40.592
Have a good trip.

02:14:41.159 --> 02:14:44.629
We're keeping the medals
for you in Belgrade.

02:14:45.199 --> 02:14:46.154
Thank you.

02:14:46.359 --> 02:14:47.235
Mr. Andrejevic!

02:14:47.719 --> 02:14:50.392
We'll play the match for third place.
We just made an agreement.

02:14:50.599 --> 02:14:52.112
Kid!
Hand over the gear!

02:14:52.319 --> 02:14:55.789
Apologize to Monsieur Rimet, but
we must see who is at third place.

02:14:55.999 --> 02:14:59.594
Where are you going?
We packed everything.

02:14:59.799 --> 02:15:01.949
What are you doing?

02:15:02.159 --> 02:15:04.070
No one never knows
with you Serbs.

02:15:04.759 --> 02:15:05.509
Andrej?

02:15:05.719 --> 02:15:06.947
Leave the guys alone.

02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:09.155
Gentlemen, let's go
watch some soccer.

02:15:18.599 --> 02:15:20.317
How're they going to
play without a goalie?

02:16:45.558 --> 02:16:48.949
As my grandfather would say, whatever
you do in life you'll be sorry.

02:16:49.558 --> 02:16:50.878
And if you do nothing?

02:16:55.718 --> 02:16:57.629
You'll still be sorry.

02:17:27.679 --> 02:17:30.112
Do you want to go to America?
You're the right kind of person.

02:17:30.439 --> 02:17:31.666
Shut up kid!

02:17:31.879 --> 02:17:33.028
Gentlemen,

02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:35.510
we must win third place.

02:17:41.239 --> 02:17:43.513
- Go to the right wing.
- It's about time you remembered.

02:18:49.799 --> 02:18:51.312
Paco!

02:18:52.079 --> 02:18:53.477
Where are you going?

02:18:55.119 --> 02:18:57.918
I'm off. I have
some work to do.

02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:05.954
Were you serious about that?

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:08.189
Which?

02:19:08.799 --> 02:19:10.915
- Staying?
- Yes.

02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.352
Hey, I was joking.

02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:17.753
This is really far away.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.558
You know what you need?

02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:31.718
Is that a souvenir?

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.157
No.
That's just a hat.

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:40.873
What is it, Poopster?

02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:53.593
- Bravo men!
- Bravo! Well done.

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:00.959
Paco!

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.593
This is for you,

02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:57.553
a gift from me.

02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:02.918
The others I can't give you.
I have to return them.

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:05.199
Thank you.

02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.789
Thank you.

02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:08.959
You've traveled far,

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:12.037
Uruguay is far away.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.558
My God, it is.

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:17.760
I am hoping you have
a story for a movie.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:22.113
You see, I should go now.

02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:27.231
I knew it.

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:32.347
There must be a place where
we will meet again.

02:22:38.433 --> 02:22:40.931
I'll see you again...

02:22:54.692 --> 02:23:00.091
In Montevideo, 1930, Yugoslav
national team won the third place.

02:23:03.283 --> 02:23:08.516
That is the greatest success
of Serbian football ever.
