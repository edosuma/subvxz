I'm very happy with this make-up.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.427
It's creepy and weird.

00:05.538 --> 00:07.506
That was so very well thought out.

00:07.583 --> 00:08.449
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:21.416 --> 00:23.250
All: Yes.

00:23.285 --> 00:24.651
What you're doing

00:24.686 --> 00:26.019

Good, because we've got

02:08.791 --> 02:10.924
But first let me introduce you
to our special guest today.

02:10.976 --> 02:12.743
He's a conlanger,

02:12.778 --> 02:15.796
or professional
language creator.

02:15.848 --> 02:17.164
And you've no doubt
heard his work

02:17.166 --> 02:19.399
on some of the biggest shows
out there.

02:19.451 --> 02:21.768
He created Dothraki
for Game of Thrones,

02:21.804 --> 02:23.170
<i>and various languages</i>

02:23.205 --> 02:26.139
<i>for Syfy's
Defiance and Dominion.</i>

02:26.175 --> 02:28.692
Let's give a warm welcome
to David Peterson.

02:28.727 --> 02:31.044
- Hi, everybody.
- [applause]

02:31.096 --> 02:32.813
Me and my roommates
love Game of Thrones.

02:32.815 --> 02:34.247
<i>We love the Dothraki,
so it's amazing</i>

02:34.283 --> 02:38.251
<i>to meet somebody
who created these languages.</i>

02:38.287 --> 02:40.520
It's really, really exciting.

02:40.556 --> 02:42.289
All right, so how did
you get started

02:42.291 --> 02:44.040
in such an unusual line of work?

02:44.093 --> 02:46.259
Well, I've been creating
languages for about ten years,

02:46.261 --> 02:48.712
and then the producers
of "Game of Thrones"

02:48.764 --> 02:49.963
put together a competition

02:49.965 --> 02:51.882
to see who would create
the Dothraki language.

02:51.934 --> 02:53.867
I was the one
who eventually got the job,

02:53.869 --> 02:55.769
and since then,
I've been working

02:55.804 --> 02:57.721
on a bunch of other
television shows and movies.

02:57.756 --> 03:00.390
- That's so cool.
- Nice.

03:00.442 --> 03:01.975
How do you go about
creating a language?

03:02.027 --> 03:03.727
The very first thing
that I have to do

03:03.762 --> 03:06.713
is figure out who's going
to be speaking this language.

03:06.748 --> 03:09.783
Once I get a really good idea
of who the people are,

03:09.835 --> 03:12.602
then I begin the long process
of fleshing out the lexicon,

03:12.638 --> 03:14.387
which can have anywhere
from 2,000, to 5,000

03:14.389 --> 03:15.372
to 6,000 words.

03:15.424 --> 03:16.556
- Wow.
- Wow.

03:16.558 --> 03:18.291
All right, well,
what do you think?

03:18.343 --> 03:19.543
You ready to get started here?

03:19.595 --> 03:20.861
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.662
Within these ruins

03:22.664 --> 03:25.182
are six sets of artifacts,
each belonging to

03:25.217 --> 03:27.134
a long-lost race.

03:27.136 --> 03:29.469
Now, David has created
a brand-new language

03:29.521 --> 03:31.171
that corresponds
to each of them.

03:31.173 --> 03:32.255
Wow.

03:32.291 --> 03:34.641
So, for this week's
Spotlight Challenge,

03:34.693 --> 03:37.377
you will be working in teams
to create a member

03:37.412 --> 03:41.148
of a long-lost race
based on a set of artifacts

03:41.200 --> 03:43.033
and its corresponding language.

03:43.068 --> 03:44.417
- Wow.
- That's amazing.

03:44.419 --> 03:46.169
- Yes.
- That's really great.

03:46.221 --> 03:49.122
<i>This challenge is so far
out of the box for me,</i>

03:49.174 --> 03:50.590
but I love the idea of it.

03:50.592 --> 03:53.593
All right, guys,
it's time to get paired up,

03:53.629 --> 03:55.028
so go ahead
and choose a new teammate.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.546
Walter?

04:01.970 --> 04:03.904
Okay, one at a time,
each team will enter

04:03.956 --> 04:06.273
the ruins and select
an artifact.

04:06.275 --> 04:08.375
When David calls out your names,

04:08.377 --> 04:09.843
you can head inside.

04:09.895 --> 04:12.145
- Kaleb and Mel, you're first.
- Yes.

04:14.716 --> 04:17.767
Good luck.

04:17.819 --> 04:19.418
This is scary.

04:19.454 --> 04:20.954
<i>We walk into these
ancient ruins,</i>

04:20.956 --> 04:22.689
<i>and there are
different artifacts</i>

04:22.691 --> 04:24.291
<i>set up on these pedestals.</i>

04:24.326 --> 04:25.525
They look very primitive,

04:25.561 --> 04:27.344
<i>and I'm immediately drawn</i>

04:27.396 --> 04:30.430
<i>towards this little deity
with snakes on the helmet.</i>

04:30.482 --> 04:32.849
- We're comfortable with this?
- Yeah.

04:34.870 --> 04:37.304
- Made it out alive.
- Barely.

04:41.944 --> 04:43.610
Oh, we've activated
the ancient curse.

04:43.662 --> 04:44.644
Run!

04:44.680 --> 04:45.645
Sea creature?

04:45.647 --> 04:46.713
I think I want the sea creature.

04:46.765 --> 04:48.415
Yeah, let's do that.

04:48.467 --> 04:51.117
I really like this.

04:51.153 --> 04:52.986
I guess we're stuck
with this one.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.020
Hmm.

04:56.024 --> 04:58.024
All right, David will be
on the reveal stage

04:58.076 --> 04:59.759
to see what you guys
have come up with.

04:59.795 --> 05:01.127
- Wow.
- That's cool.

05:01.163 --> 05:02.662
So, David, what will you
be looking for,

05:02.714 --> 05:04.664
in terms of how our artists
interpret their languages

05:04.666 --> 05:06.016
and artifacts?

05:06.051 --> 05:08.451
Each of the language sketches
that I've created

05:08.503 --> 05:10.637
has a phonetic clue
to give you an idea

05:10.672 --> 05:12.939
of what I was imagining
when I created the language.

05:12.975 --> 05:14.307
On the reveal stage,

05:14.309 --> 05:16.409
I want to look
at your creature and say,

05:16.445 --> 05:17.611
"Yes, that is exactly
who should be

05:17.663 --> 05:18.845
speaking that language."

05:18.880 --> 05:19.846
All right.

05:19.848 --> 05:20.981
So why don't you guys

05:21.016 --> 05:22.849
head inside the ruins
and get started?

05:22.884 --> 05:23.984
Good luck.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.252
All:
Thank you.

05:29.057 --> 05:30.574
Yeah.

05:30.609 --> 05:35.111
<i>[man speaking guttural language]</i>

05:35.147 --> 05:37.030
Scary.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.499
<i>Our las terrifying.</i>

05:39.551 --> 05:41.701
It an inhale and exhale sound.

05:41.737 --> 05:44.504
<i>We know we have
to incorporate something</i>

05:44.506 --> 05:46.973
<i>maybe with a bladder or some
sort of breathing mechanism.</i>

05:47.009 --> 05:50.393
I'm thinking maybe, like, cobra.

05:50.429 --> 05:53.213
We take the shapes
from the snakes on the helmet,

05:53.265 --> 05:56.216
<i>and we decide to do an elder
in a snake society,</i>

05:56.251 --> 05:58.551
<i>one that can rule
and lead his people.</i>

06:00.555 --> 06:02.622
[hollow tapping]

06:02.658 --> 06:06.977
<i>[man speaking
stringent language]</i>

06:07.029 --> 06:09.746
There's just lots of k-k-k...
Like, I don't even...

06:09.781 --> 06:12.649
There's a lot of weird Ks
and vowels all mixed together.

06:12.684 --> 06:14.267
<i>It sounds very Nordic.</i>

06:14.269 --> 06:16.519
Like, I would like to do
a big-cat-type creature.

06:16.571 --> 06:19.673
Yeah, and then he can
also be wearing, like...

06:19.675 --> 06:20.740
Like a hide.

06:20.776 --> 06:22.275
He is this feline creature.

06:22.311 --> 06:25.178
He's this powerful,
intelligent race

06:25.213 --> 06:28.381
<i>that is in constant battle
with a wolf race,</i>

06:28.417 --> 06:29.933
<i>and they kill the wolves</i>

06:29.985 --> 06:31.785
and wear them
like trophies as a pelt.

06:35.924 --> 06:38.591
[camera shutter clicks]

06:38.627 --> 06:41.378
<i>[woman speaking
halting language]</i>

06:41.430 --> 06:44.297
- [chuckles]
- What the hell?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.082
So we listen to our language,

06:46.118 --> 06:48.001
and it sounds
kind of aggressive.

06:48.036 --> 06:50.036
<i>[woman growling]</i>

06:50.088 --> 06:51.588
<i>We picked a vase</i>

06:51.623 --> 06:55.942
with some kind of octopus,
squid creature with tentacles,

06:55.977 --> 06:58.044
<i>and since we hear that clicking,</i>

06:58.080 --> 07:01.047
<i>we think the octopus
has this beak</i>

07:01.083 --> 07:03.016
<i>that could be clicking,
you know, when he talks...</i>

07:03.051 --> 07:04.034
<i>clack, clack, clack.</i>

07:08.707 --> 07:10.757
Okay.

07:14.363 --> 07:18.048
<i>[man speaking
robotic language rapidly]</i>

07:18.100 --> 07:20.116
It takes a minute
because it's just so fast.

07:20.168 --> 07:21.701
It's like...
[blabbering rapidly]

07:21.703 --> 07:24.688
[laughs] And I'm like,
"What was that again?"

07:24.723 --> 07:27.607
<i>So it sounds like
he's barking orders.</i>

07:27.642 --> 07:30.510
He's very stern,
but he still sounds human.

07:30.545 --> 07:32.495
People think of him as a god.

07:32.547 --> 07:34.814
That's actually
what I was thinking too.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.650
So we both come up
with pretty much the same idea,

07:37.686 --> 07:43.574
<i>that he is a person
who has deemed himself a god,</i>

07:43.610 --> 07:46.013
<i>and he is in control
of his tribe of ancient people,</i>

07:46.113 --> 07:49.047
but he's not leading them
in a good way.

07:49.099 --> 07:50.465
He has all the wealth.

07:50.517 --> 07:53.351
He controls everybody's
food supply, what they get.

07:53.387 --> 07:54.920
He's pure evil.

07:57.391 --> 07:59.724
All right, everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.327
- Yay.
- Here, I'll take this.

08:07.718 --> 08:08.734
Whoo-hoo!

08:11.472 --> 08:12.905
- Try that.
- Okay, there you go.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.140
<i>[woman speaking calm language]</i>

08:15.192 --> 08:18.711
Katie and I hear these
very low sort of speaking tones,

08:18.713 --> 08:20.379
almost like a prayer.

08:20.414 --> 08:23.182
<i>[woman speaking calm language]</i>

08:23.217 --> 08:24.450
We call her
"Mother of Death."

08:24.485 --> 08:26.151
<i>She's this priestess</i>

08:26.187 --> 08:27.786
<i>that was born
with a facial anomaly,</i>

08:27.822 --> 08:30.823
<i>and we incorporate the wings
from the artifact as</i>

08:30.858 --> 08:32.474
<i>a scarification on her back.</i>

08:32.510 --> 08:35.693
She is supposed to be beautiful
and terrifying to this culture.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.580
She is the only mother
than can deliver you...

08:38.616 --> 08:39.698
- Okay.
- to the next life.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.033
I like that.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.018
I was thinking more and more
and more about the language,

08:43.070 --> 08:44.570
'cause all they do
is, like, that...

08:44.605 --> 08:45.704
[imitates hissing]
Sound.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.589
Njoroge and I notice
that the vocal range

08:47.625 --> 08:48.974
is very limited
for our creature.

08:48.976 --> 08:52.311
<i>[creature hissing,
clicking tongue]</i>

08:52.346 --> 08:55.364
Therefore their other senses
would be heightened.

08:55.416 --> 08:57.950
So we decide we want to create
this reptile race

08:57.985 --> 08:59.752
<i>with really big eyes
and really big ears.</i>

08:59.787 --> 09:00.819
I think it'd be cool

09:00.855 --> 09:02.855
if the eyes went onto the cowl

09:02.907 --> 09:03.922
and onto the face.

09:03.958 --> 09:05.324
It's really not human at all.

09:05.359 --> 09:08.293
<i>And because our artifact
is some kind of ray gun,</i>

09:08.329 --> 09:11.397
<i>we decide that we really want
to go with futuristic-looking,</i>

09:11.432 --> 09:13.415
<i>even though it's ancient.</i>

09:13.467 --> 09:15.667
I think it'd be cool, too,
to do, like, dome-ish ears.

09:15.703 --> 09:17.586
<i>I've never done anything
like this before,</i>

09:17.621 --> 09:20.105
but I'm here to take
a lot of risks.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.082
I, like, kind of
hate these ears,

09:30.134 --> 09:32.251
but I'm gonna come back to them
after I do this part.

09:32.286 --> 09:34.086
I'm very confident
at sculpting ears,

09:34.088 --> 09:36.188
<i>but I'm not getting</i>

09:36.223 --> 09:37.990
<i>the detail I want,
so I really hate it.</i>

09:38.025 --> 09:40.426
I think they're something
to talk about,

09:40.428 --> 09:41.794
because I love them.

09:41.796 --> 09:43.045
I know that McKenzie

09:43.097 --> 09:44.630
<i>and Mr. Westmore
are gonna agree with me.</i>

09:44.682 --> 09:46.832
So I say to Kaleb,
"Whatever they say goes."

09:46.867 --> 09:49.468
- Yeah, let's do it.
- [chuckles]

09:53.240 --> 09:55.841
Are you sold on the eyes 100%?

09:55.876 --> 09:59.044
Yeah, the eyes are
my favorite thing about it.

09:59.096 --> 10:01.547
Hey, guys, we're here
to take a look at your work.

10:01.599 --> 10:02.581
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:02.616 --> 10:04.216
- Hi.
- All right.

10:04.251 --> 10:05.400
Let's see what you have, Robert.

10:05.453 --> 10:06.401
- Okay.
- Hmm.

10:06.454 --> 10:07.953
It's like a squid.

10:08.005 --> 10:09.388
'Cause it looks like
you're taking most of it

10:09.423 --> 10:10.506
from your artifact.

10:10.558 --> 10:13.192
What are you using
in here to make the language?

10:13.194 --> 10:15.527
I have kind of
a beak thing going there

10:15.563 --> 10:17.863
<i>- that might do click sounds.
- Uh-huh.</i>

10:17.898 --> 10:20.632
I think you have to be
very careful in the painting

10:20.668 --> 10:22.768
because it's going to
look like a bird,

10:22.803 --> 10:25.204
- as opposed to an octopus.
- Yeah.

10:25.239 --> 10:26.355
So we have...

10:26.390 --> 10:29.208
It's, like,
two snakes wrapped around.

10:29.243 --> 10:30.542
<i>Like, a helmet of snakes, right?</i>

10:30.578 --> 10:31.643
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:31.679 --> 10:33.345
A point that
we're disagreeing on,

10:33.397 --> 10:36.415
and I want your opinion,
is the ears.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.450
- I like the ears.
- I like them a lot.

10:38.452 --> 10:40.285
If you can dig that clay out...

10:40.337 --> 10:41.653
Sorry, Mel.

10:41.655 --> 10:45.591
You've got a very
alien-humanoid look

10:45.593 --> 10:47.092
going on here.

10:47.128 --> 10:48.093
Very nice.

10:48.129 --> 10:49.178
Let's move over here.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.379
Yeah, let's take a look
at the face.

10:50.431 --> 10:52.364
I like the eyebrows.
I like what you have going on.

10:52.399 --> 10:53.866
And I like what you're doing
to the mouth,

10:53.901 --> 10:55.400
as opposed to just a slit.

10:55.452 --> 10:56.435
Very good.

10:56.470 --> 10:58.137
Both:
Thank you so much.

10:58.172 --> 11:01.039
Well, with the sound,
you know, it's very whispery.

11:01.075 --> 11:03.709
It's very limited in what kind
of sounds they can make.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.445
<i>Since the one sense would be
lowered,</i>

11:06.480 --> 11:07.946
<i>all the other senses
would be heightened,</i>

11:07.982 --> 11:10.015
therefore the big eyes,
big, dome-like ears.

11:10.050 --> 11:12.417
- Ears?
- Hmm.

11:12.453 --> 11:15.871
I'm just concerned what you're
doing is kind of cartoony.

11:15.923 --> 11:18.257
<i>Mr. Westmore spots it
immediately...</i>

11:18.292 --> 11:20.359
"Whoa.
What's going on with the eyes?"

11:20.361 --> 11:22.027
Literally, I'm really concerned.

11:22.062 --> 11:24.296
Are you gonna paint them or...?

11:24.298 --> 11:27.599
Yeah, the actor will be able
to see through the bottom.

11:27.635 --> 11:30.402
And then the whole thing
will be painted like an eye.

11:30.437 --> 11:31.620
This is not good.

11:31.672 --> 11:34.406
You ought to rethink it
a little bit.

11:39.685 --> 11:42.019
The eyes
are what I'm concerned about.

11:42.054 --> 11:43.353
Yeah, I am too.

11:43.389 --> 11:44.988
You're trying to do so much
with the eyes here,

11:45.040 --> 11:47.724
but I think you're missing
on your head shape.

11:47.776 --> 11:50.394
Mr. Westmore vocalizes
what I'm not saying.

11:50.429 --> 11:52.246
<i>We need to change everything.</i>

11:52.298 --> 11:54.181
Even though
it's humanoid in shape,

11:54.216 --> 11:56.433
it needs a little more reptile
thinking into it.

11:56.468 --> 11:57.835
Okay.

11:57.870 --> 11:59.436
<i>We just wasted a ton
of time with these sculpts,</i>

11:59.471 --> 12:01.655
so we need to figure it out,
and we have to do it quick.

12:01.707 --> 12:02.739
- Good luck.
- I appreciate it.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.974
Thank you, sir.

12:03.976 --> 12:07.110
He's gonna be weathered,
really leathery.

12:07.146 --> 12:09.446
I think what you have
to be careful with

12:09.481 --> 12:13.750
is that it doesn't turn
into a caricature of an old man.

12:13.752 --> 12:16.486
We're gonna make
his skin cracking and...

12:16.522 --> 12:17.988
- Oh, good, okay.
- Yeah, really weathered.

12:18.023 --> 12:19.389
- Okay.
- Damaged, yeah.

12:19.391 --> 12:21.825
Well, by adding a little bit
more bone structure to it,

12:21.827 --> 12:24.461
you're gonna be able
to crack it deeper.

12:24.496 --> 12:28.232
So we're thinking of a
big-cat/human hybrid character.

12:28.267 --> 12:31.768
The feline species
are the more intelligent,

12:31.804 --> 12:35.172
so they hunt the canine,
more primitive...

12:35.224 --> 12:37.253
So basically you're saying
cats are smarter than dogs?

12:37.254 --> 12:38.746
- A little bit.
- Glenn would love that.

12:39.312 --> 12:43.390
This is going to have to be
magnificient in the paint job.

12:43.425 --> 12:44.514
If you did use a little hair,

12:44.550 --> 12:46.383
put it down here
in the shoulder area

12:46.418 --> 12:49.019
and then just take it up
on the sides of it there.

12:49.054 --> 12:50.037
Yeah.

12:50.072 --> 12:51.405
All right, so how are you going

12:51.457 --> 12:52.422
to bring all this together?

12:52.458 --> 12:54.324
<i>She is the Mother of Death,</i>

12:54.360 --> 12:57.661
because she delivers the souls
into the next world.

12:57.696 --> 12:59.012
Wow.

12:59.064 --> 13:01.331
I think it's very interesting,
and it's different.

13:01.383 --> 13:03.133
I can't say I've really seen

13:03.168 --> 13:05.118
any of the other artists here
do that before.

13:05.170 --> 13:06.737
- Okay, cool. Awesome.
- Yeah.

13:06.739 --> 13:08.205
We'll take it.
[laughter]

13:08.240 --> 13:09.272
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

13:09.308 --> 13:11.174
- Can't wait to see these.
- Thank you.

13:11.226 --> 13:12.342
- Thank you.
- Bye.

13:12.378 --> 13:13.777
Bye-bye.

13:17.549 --> 13:19.266
If we're gonna make changes,
we got to make them now.

13:19.301 --> 13:20.784
What do you want to do?

13:20.819 --> 13:22.886
We'll change the eyes, and
I'll take the thing and move it.

13:22.921 --> 13:24.688
So, as soon
as Mr. Westmore leaves,

13:24.690 --> 13:26.289
<i>we scrap those eyes,</i>

13:26.291 --> 13:27.691
and Njoroge starts
sculpting new ones

13:27.693 --> 13:29.659
<i>that are a little more round,
like a tree frog.</i>

13:29.695 --> 13:32.262
What do you think about
a little bit more like that?

13:32.314 --> 13:33.864
Yeah, that's cool.

13:33.866 --> 13:36.116
<i>And I'm gonna make the cowl
more cobra-like.</i>

13:36.168 --> 13:38.151
I know Ant's been bottom before,

13:38.187 --> 13:40.037
and I know
I've been bottom before.

13:40.039 --> 13:41.421
<i>I don't want to be there again.</i>

13:41.457 --> 13:46.309
So now there's no room
for error.

13:50.799 --> 13:52.182
<i>My plan for the cowl</i>

13:52.234 --> 13:55.469
<i>is to completely cover it up
with beads and jewels</i>

13:55.521 --> 13:58.155
and then, right before molding,
pop them right out,

13:58.190 --> 13:59.856
and then I can give
them in afterwards.

13:59.858 --> 14:01.358
They might get trapped
in the mold.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.276
You might not be able
to pop them out.

14:03.328 --> 14:04.578
- Otherwise...
- If they get stuck,

14:04.613 --> 14:07.064
then we're, like,
in a lot of trouble.

14:07.099 --> 14:09.166
Oh, my God, like,
this is not gonna work.

14:09.168 --> 14:10.467
So...

14:10.502 --> 14:13.003
We'll figure out something
else for the rest of it.

14:13.038 --> 14:14.571
If I don't think
of something quick,

14:14.606 --> 14:17.974
<i>it's just gonna be this blank,
square headpiece,</i>

14:18.010 --> 14:20.844
which that's not gonna fly.

14:20.846 --> 14:22.929
<i>So we're coming
towards the end of the day,</i>

14:22.981 --> 14:25.315
<i>and that's
when this idea hits me,</i>

14:25.350 --> 14:27.317
"Well, maybe I can cut the shape
that I want

14:27.319 --> 14:28.618
<i>into a Popsicle stick,</i>

14:28.654 --> 14:30.587
and that could look
like diamonds."

14:30.589 --> 14:33.090
What if I do something
like this?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.591
Nice.

14:34.626 --> 14:37.594
I think this
is gonna look awesome.

14:37.629 --> 14:38.995
That's time, everyone!

14:50.409 --> 14:51.408
Let's go.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.009
Kaleb and I
hit the ground running.

14:53.045 --> 14:55.045
We immediately go
to the mold room,

14:55.080 --> 14:57.013
<i>because the faster
we finish our molds,</i>

14:57.049 --> 14:59.883
<i>the more time we'll have
to fabricate the collar</i>

14:59.918 --> 15:01.485
<i>and the bladder.</i>

15:03.856 --> 15:05.388
Gonna be able to mold
that up soon?

15:05.441 --> 15:06.656
Yeah.

15:06.708 --> 15:08.458
Ant and I get back to work
on our sculptures...

15:08.494 --> 15:11.011
<i>Ant on the cowl,
I'm working on the face still.</i>

15:11.046 --> 15:13.130
It's just too flat.
I want the roundness of it.

15:13.182 --> 15:15.599
That's gonna help sell
the whole eye thing.

15:15.634 --> 15:18.401
I change the shape of the eye
to a large almond shape,

15:18.437 --> 15:19.986
<i>so I feel better.</i>

15:20.022 --> 15:22.272
I like where
the face sculpture's going.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.707
<i>The cowl that I'm sculpting</i>

15:23.742 --> 15:25.592
is a lot bigger than most
of the other cowls,

15:25.644 --> 15:26.927
<i>and I'm proud of that.</i>

15:26.979 --> 15:29.129
<i>I really want to deviate
from the human form</i>

15:29.164 --> 15:30.881
<i>as much as possible.</i>

15:35.888 --> 15:38.388
♪ I've got no shoes
on my feet ♪

15:38.390 --> 15:40.056
What is this?
Why are you doing this?

15:40.058 --> 15:42.058
We're gonna lifecast my feet.

15:42.094 --> 15:44.194
For our big cat's feet,

15:44.229 --> 15:47.714
<i>we need a positive to sculpt on.</i>

15:47.766 --> 15:49.266
<i>So I fix up the alginate,</i>

15:49.301 --> 15:51.201
<i>and I put it
all over Walter's feet.</i>

15:51.236 --> 15:53.103
- This is really disturbing.
- [chuckles]

15:53.138 --> 15:55.906
Once that sets up,
we pop his foot out,

15:55.941 --> 15:59.976
and we pour UltraCal inside
to create the positive.

16:00.012 --> 16:03.280
So now we have a perfect cast
of my beautiful feet,

16:03.332 --> 16:04.698
<i>and I sculpt it,</i>

16:04.750 --> 16:07.317
<i>add an arch so that it
looks like a lion's foot.</i>

16:07.352 --> 16:09.186
<i>I'm really hoping
that it helps bring</i>

16:09.221 --> 16:11.087
the total character together.

16:13.425 --> 16:16.426
You know, Njoroge,
after Game Board Man,

16:16.478 --> 16:19.479
this is Octoman.

16:19.515 --> 16:21.181
- Octoman?
- Octoman.

16:21.233 --> 16:26.369
We decide to call our
squid guy Octoman, naturally,

16:26.405 --> 16:29.105
<i>but his very close friends
call him Sushi.</i>

16:29.141 --> 16:30.540
Are you gonna name
all of your faces?

16:30.576 --> 16:31.942
Of course.

16:31.977 --> 16:35.712
Game Board Man, now Octoman.

16:35.747 --> 16:39.449
♪ Octoman, Octoman, he swims ♪

16:39.451 --> 16:41.368
♪ It's Octoman ♪

16:41.403 --> 16:43.286
- Very cool.
- Thank you.

16:43.322 --> 16:45.238
I'm glad you like Octoman.

16:45.274 --> 16:46.957
[chuckles]

16:46.959 --> 16:48.959
It's stupid.

16:53.232 --> 16:55.282
That's cool.
I really like it.

16:55.317 --> 16:56.449
- Do you?
- Yeah.

16:56.485 --> 16:58.401
Anna is finishing up the face,

16:58.403 --> 17:01.204
and I'm focusing
on this headpiece.

17:01.256 --> 17:03.406
<i>I start using a sculpting tool</i>

17:03.442 --> 17:05.909
<i>just to make
these little diamond shapes.</i>

17:05.944 --> 17:07.243
<i>This is a pretty big cowl,</i>

17:07.279 --> 17:10.195
so I start working as fast
as I possibly can.

17:10.249 --> 17:12.115
Dude, that looks awesome, right?

17:12.117 --> 17:13.316
That does look awesome.

17:13.352 --> 17:15.185
Anna's looking pretty good
on that end,

17:15.186 --> 17:16.953
and we're ready to mold.

17:16.989 --> 17:18.788
There we go.

17:26.865 --> 17:29.115
So I start to mold this cowl,

17:29.167 --> 17:32.202
but as soon
as I put on the first coat...

17:32.254 --> 17:33.703
[sighs]

17:33.755 --> 17:36.089
The UltraCal is heavy enough
on the top of the head

17:36.124 --> 17:38.642
<i>that it starts to droop.</i>

17:38.677 --> 17:40.443
Robert, I need your help.

17:40.479 --> 17:43.880
And I'm like,
"This cannot happen right now."

17:43.915 --> 17:45.732
Rob, Robert, Robert,
Robert, Robert.

17:45.784 --> 17:48.068
- Yeah?
- I need your help.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.402
What's going on?
Too heavy?

17:49.454 --> 17:50.487
Yeah, these are drooping.

17:50.489 --> 17:52.038
I need you to hold them
in place.

17:52.074 --> 17:53.189
Okay.

17:53.191 --> 17:54.991
The whole thing
is kind of dipping back.

17:55.027 --> 17:57.260
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Shit.

17:57.312 --> 17:59.429
Then suddenly the top dips too.

17:59.464 --> 18:00.614
[sighs]
Okay.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.767
<i>This cowl is our most
important piece.</i>

18:03.769 --> 18:05.735
It's just pandemonium.

18:09.304 --> 18:11.271
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Shit.

18:11.306 --> 18:14.274
<i>The UltraCal on our cowl is so
heavy on the top of the head</i>

18:14.276 --> 18:15.759
that it starts to droop.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.260
[sighs]
Okay.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.880
I have to really move quickly,
or I'm going to lose this cowl.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.265
I'm like, "Screw it.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.184
I am gonna just ruin
the back of the sculpture

18:24.219 --> 18:26.720
and just shove Popsicle sticks
in there to hold this up."

18:26.722 --> 18:28.688
Okay, let go.
Then we'll see.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.056
- Let's see this one.
- Are you sure?

18:30.058 --> 18:32.108
Yep, go ahead.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.110
So crisis kind of averted.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.630
Now you know how they felt
when they built the pyramids.

18:36.665 --> 18:39.699
That was pretty intense,
but we fix it.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.452
They call me
The Plaster Whisperer.

18:42.504 --> 18:45.155
[chuckles] Well, you better
start yelling at it.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.648
As Katie's finishing the cowl,

18:54.683 --> 18:56.933
<i>I start drawing scarification
wings on the back,</i>

18:56.985 --> 19:00.487
<i>which represent her initiation
into the priestesshood,</i>

19:00.522 --> 19:02.155
<i>and I also
want to reference elements</i>

19:02.191 --> 19:06.092
from Katie's cowl sculpt
and make it a unified design.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.310
- [sighs]
- That'll look cool.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.496
Hopefully.

19:13.535 --> 19:15.418
<i>We are trying to create
a bladder in the neck.</i>

19:15.454 --> 19:19.372
That way, it can show
the phonetics of the in and out

19:19.408 --> 19:20.574
<i>that our language has.</i>

19:20.609 --> 19:23.210
<i>[man speaking guttural language]</i>

19:23.245 --> 19:25.145
<i>We have to make it fit
under the neck,</i>

19:25.147 --> 19:28.215
and we're not exactly sure
how to execute that correctly.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.850
- 'Cause, look, it...
- Oh, nice.

19:30.886 --> 19:32.002
And then we don't have to worry

19:32.037 --> 19:33.370
about having it in his mouth.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.205
We have a hose that runs down
from his neck

19:35.240 --> 19:37.958
<i>with a pump so our model
can control it himself.</i>

19:37.993 --> 19:39.993
<i>Hopefully it'll work perfectly.</i>

19:40.045 --> 19:41.695
[gasps]

19:44.900 --> 19:45.849
There you go.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.050
We open the mold

19:47.102 --> 19:49.035
and start cleaning it out,
getting it ready.

19:49.071 --> 19:51.721
Yeah, it came out.
All right.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.506
Now I can breathe
a little sigh of relief,

19:53.542 --> 19:56.710
<i>but we still have to figure out
how to make the tentacles work,</i>

19:56.745 --> 20:00.747
<i>so I try to make them
using cotton and latex,</i>

20:00.782 --> 20:03.533
but the cotton
is absorbing the latex,

20:03.585 --> 20:07.120
<i>and that's not working.</i>

20:07.172 --> 20:09.556
I didn't get a pull
out of the tentacles.

20:09.591 --> 20:11.024
It just wasn't working.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.909
Clearly, I don't know how
to make these tentacles work,

20:12.945 --> 20:16.096
<i>and I'm done trying today,
because time is ticking,</i>

20:16.131 --> 20:20.600
so we have
to figure it out tomorrow.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.385
15 minutes!

20:25.907 --> 20:27.407
Nice.

20:27.442 --> 20:28.959
This is awesome.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.065
All right, guys, it's time!

20:47.262 --> 20:49.729
I'm running. I'm running,
I'm running, I'm running.

20:49.765 --> 20:52.098
All right, this is gnarly, but
this is all gonna be covered.

20:52.134 --> 20:54.067
[moaning]

20:55.937 --> 20:57.604
Johnny, it came out good.

20:57.639 --> 20:59.289
<i>We look at our pieces,</i>

20:59.341 --> 21:00.907
and they came out very nice.

21:00.909 --> 21:03.076
<i>So I go to the mold room</i>

21:03.078 --> 21:07.013
to run the tentacles
in poly foam.

21:07.049 --> 21:11.084
<i>Hopefully I can make
this mold work this time.</i>

21:12.704 --> 21:13.820
Johnny.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.038
How's it going?
Walter.

21:15.073 --> 21:16.156
- Matt. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.941
Our models arrive,
and Rob starts applying

21:17.993 --> 21:19.659
<i>the bald cap and the face.</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:21.044
<i>While he's doing that,</i>

21:21.079 --> 21:22.545
<i>I'm trying to make the wolf head</i>

21:22.581 --> 21:25.265
<i>look as realistic as possible
just with paint.</i>

21:25.267 --> 21:26.766
I would really like to lay hair,

21:26.818 --> 21:29.352
<i>but just don't have enough time.</i>

21:29.404 --> 21:31.148
Doing okay in that position?

21:32.374 --> 21:33.990
Anna is painting the face

21:34.042 --> 21:36.860
<i>while I coat the cowl in black
so the metallic will pop.</i>

21:36.895 --> 21:39.479
Then I start dry-sponging
the gold on.

21:39.481 --> 21:41.865
All right,
let's shoot for half an hour

21:41.900 --> 21:42.899
for you to finish this,

21:42.951 --> 21:44.634
because I need your help
body painting

21:44.670 --> 21:45.919
and all that stuff too.

21:45.954 --> 21:49.122
I'll totally be good
in a half hour, for sure.

21:49.124 --> 21:50.757
I'm doing this as fast as I can,

21:50.759 --> 21:52.676
<i>'cause we got to just get
this whole thing painted</i>

21:52.728 --> 21:53.843
and onto the model.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.267
<i>While Katie
is painting the face,</i>

22:01.303 --> 22:03.903
I start applying the scars
on her back.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.789
<i>Since they're made of silicone,</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:08.575
<i>I use alcohol paints
to break up the edges,</i>

22:08.577 --> 22:10.760
<i>and then I go
into the scars themselves</i>

22:10.796 --> 22:13.713
<i>and giving them this sort
of shiny, pink texture.</i>

22:13.715 --> 22:15.932
It looks very realistic.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.969
Now, how do we attach this
so he's comfortable?

22:20.021 --> 22:22.872
We have no idea if the bladder
is actually gonna work.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.758
It's sort of something
that we hope.

22:24.793 --> 22:26.409
I feel like if we just
sort of attach it at the top

22:26.445 --> 22:29.512
and then underneath
so that it can, like, go out.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.964
<i>We put the bladder on his neck</i>

22:30.999 --> 22:32.382
<i>and stretch the foam across it</i>

22:32.417 --> 22:33.833
<i>to make sure it's not too thick,</i>

22:33.885 --> 22:35.668
that it won't show
the function of it.

22:35.721 --> 22:39.139
[speaking guttural language]

22:39.174 --> 22:40.673
<i>It feels comfortable.
It works.</i>

22:40.675 --> 22:42.942
And we're feeling really
excited about this.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.745
Yeah.
This is perfect.

22:49.718 --> 22:51.785
We also got some across there,
and it looks cool.

22:51.837 --> 22:54.170
I just think it needs to be...

22:54.206 --> 22:57.674
not so, "Ho, ho, ho."

22:57.709 --> 22:59.392
We want it to look
like a poison arrow frog

22:59.444 --> 23:01.795
without crossing into cartoony.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.663
<i>So Njoroge lays down a bunch
of bright colors,</i>

23:03.665 --> 23:06.032
<i>and then I go over it
with browns, reds,</i>

23:06.067 --> 23:08.084
and a little bit of black.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.719
It's gonna kill me if I hear,
"Well, we love the idea,

23:09.755 --> 23:11.087
but we don't like the paint."

23:11.139 --> 23:12.572
Yeah, that's not gonna go well.

23:12.574 --> 23:13.706
I know that it's a risk

23:13.742 --> 23:15.141
doing something so bright
and so vivid,

23:15.143 --> 23:16.726
<i>but our concept
is not like anybody else's,</i>

23:16.778 --> 23:18.845
so I don't think
our makeup should be either.

23:22.451 --> 23:24.334
<i>So I go over
and check on the poly foam,</i>

23:24.369 --> 23:26.035
<i>and it's still not ready.</i>

23:26.087 --> 23:27.454
I don't know what's going on,

23:27.456 --> 23:28.755
but it looks like the poly foam

23:28.807 --> 23:30.173
didn't fully set up
or something.

23:30.225 --> 23:31.491
Yeah, I noticed that.

23:31.526 --> 23:33.693
Yeah, I went to pull it,
and it ripped in half.

23:33.728 --> 23:36.729
The poly foam is taking
way too long to set up,

23:36.765 --> 23:38.081
<i>so we scrap the tentacles.</i>

23:38.133 --> 23:39.883
- It's what we have.
- Yep.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.751
<i>Losing the tentacles</i>

23:41.803 --> 23:44.504
is gonna be really detrimental
to the finished look

23:44.506 --> 23:45.805
<i>of this character,</i>

23:45.841 --> 23:48.007
<i>so I'm trying
to put as much effort</i>

23:48.059 --> 23:49.809
into this paint job

23:49.845 --> 23:52.428
<i>to hopefully bolster it enough
to keep us here,</i>

23:52.464 --> 23:55.415
but time is not on our side.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.617

24:05.126 --> 24:07.644

24:09.297 --> 24:10.814
Oy, oy, yeah.

24:12.667 --> 24:14.801
Leaving for Last Looks,
we have a lot to do.

24:14.803 --> 24:17.370
First thing, get
the fucking thing on his head.

24:17.405 --> 24:19.539
We still have to apply the cowl,

24:19.541 --> 24:21.925
<i>finish the paint job,
get him in wardrobe.</i>

24:21.960 --> 24:25.445
It's not gonna be the makeup
that we envisioned.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.948
I'm just hoping to not be
on the chopping block.

24:39.257 --> 24:41.357
<i>We get to Last Looks,
and Walter and I still have</i>

24:41.409 --> 24:43.526
to finish the paint job
on the face,

24:43.561 --> 24:48.164
apply the cowl, and then apply
our feet in one hour.

24:52.971 --> 24:54.670
Just getting you ready
for school.

24:54.706 --> 24:56.305
Once we put on the cowl,

24:56.341 --> 24:57.840
<i>it is such a frenzy</i>

24:57.892 --> 24:59.509
<i>trying to get
everything finished.</i>

24:59.561 --> 25:01.644
Robert, please don't put
your fingers in that.

25:01.646 --> 25:03.613
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

25:03.615 --> 25:05.732
I kind of mottle the face red,

25:05.767 --> 25:08.534
<i>but it doesn't really match
with the top part,</i>

25:08.570 --> 25:10.853
but I just want
some paint on there

25:10.905 --> 25:13.439
<i>to be able to send him out.</i>

25:13.491 --> 25:14.857
<i>Ant paints the mouth</i>

25:14.909 --> 25:17.593
with this white stripe
through the middle.

25:17.629 --> 25:19.362
It's completely cartoony.

25:21.416 --> 25:24.751
I have some dark green with
brown mixed in in my airbrush,

25:24.803 --> 25:28.588
<i>so I go in and spray
a defining line on the mouth,</i>

25:28.623 --> 25:30.740
and I feel like I fixed it.

25:30.775 --> 25:34.277
- Yeah, that's better.
- Yeah.

25:34.312 --> 25:35.578
We have to take them out.

25:35.630 --> 25:37.079
We are having troubles.

25:37.081 --> 25:39.732
The teeth are a little bit
too big for our model's mouth.

25:39.768 --> 25:41.017
It's not looking right.

25:41.019 --> 25:43.453
Fuck.
It's ruining the prosthetic.

25:43.488 --> 25:45.021
We decide to scrap
the teeth idea

25:45.056 --> 25:46.689
'cause the makeup's
far more important.

25:46.724 --> 25:49.659
<i>Plus, he needs to be able to

26:59.063 --> 27:01.614
For this week's
Spotlight Challenge,

27:01.649 --> 27:03.032
we asked you
to choose a language

27:03.067 --> 27:04.734
and its corresponding artifacts

27:04.786 --> 27:08.404
and use them to create
the member of a long-lost race.

Okay, judges, it's time
to take a closer look

29:29.197 --> 29:30.863
at our revitalized races.

29:37.722 --> 29:39.072
Such a difference

29:39.107 --> 29:41.924

and the quality of the face.

I like the face.

Yeah, I think the face
is really good up close.

29:45.897 --> 29:47.780
With the mouth,
the language I designed,

29:47.816 --> 29:49.282
it's spoken with the back

with these lips.

29:53.471 --> 29:55.104
This is kind of cool.

29:55.106 --> 29:58.241
Some of the sculpting feels
like it's becoming a mummy,

29:58.293 --> 30:01.277

seems very ceremonial.

30:01.329 --> 30:03.963
I love that, though. That's
what makes it feel Egyptian.

30:03.998 --> 30:05.248
It was important to me
that the mouth

30:05.283 --> 30:07.366

didn't impede the speed

like this up close

I mean, they built
this entire headpiece,

30:16.728 --> 30:18.394
and there's, like,
a wing motif going on

30:18.396 --> 30:20.613
that's on the side of the head,
then replicated.

30:20.665 --> 30:22.165
It's so cool.

30:24.486 --> 30:25.768
I love those recessed eyes.

30:25.820 --> 30:27.920
It's kind of creepy-like,
isn't it?

30:27.956 --> 30:29.489
Especially
with the black lenses.

30:29.524 --> 30:31.574
Do it again.
Cool.

30:31.626 --> 30:34.827
- So there's a bladder in there.
- Tilt your head way down.

30:34.879 --> 30:36.996
There's something going on
on the top of your head.

30:37.031 --> 30:38.548
- Oh.
- Nice stuff.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.599
Rad.

30:39.634 --> 30:42.885
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is.

30:42.937 --> 30:44.387
Looks kind of like
a praying mantis.

30:44.439 --> 30:47.340
Why did they paint
this whole thing solid green?

30:47.375 --> 30:49.475
Yeah, it feels very synthetic.

30:49.527 --> 30:53.229
It kills me,
because it looks rushed.

30:53.264 --> 30:54.864
None of the wrinkles
have any direction,

30:54.899 --> 30:57.400
form, or gravity...
they don't make sense.

30:57.435 --> 30:59.469
I'm really nervous.
I'm not ready to leave.

31:01.105 --> 31:03.072
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter and tell us

31:03.107 --> 31:07.276
who made your favorite
revitalized race using #FaceOff

31:11.083 --> 31:15.584
It feels so masky.
So big and so rough.

31:15.636 --> 31:18.570
- And the big plastic eyes.
- Yeah.

31:18.606 --> 31:20.622
I know mine's in the bottom.

31:20.658 --> 31:24.309
So there's apprehension
creeping up on me again.

31:24.311 --> 31:29.081
A really good paint job
could have saved this makeup.

31:29.116 --> 31:31.350
It's just too literal.

31:31.352 --> 31:34.286
Can you go ahead and produce
your line for us real quick?

31:34.338 --> 31:36.822
[speaking halting language]

31:36.857 --> 31:39.591
There are a number of sounds
produced with both of the lips,

31:39.593 --> 31:40.943
including a...
[pops lips]

31:40.995 --> 31:42.294
With a beak like this,

31:42.296 --> 31:44.229
it's simply
not physically possible.

31:44.281 --> 31:46.532
- Thanks.
- Okay, thank you.

31:50.204 --> 31:52.187
All right, the judges
have scored your creations,

31:52.223 --> 31:54.139
so let's find out
what they thought.

31:54.191 --> 31:57.076
Walter and Rob...

31:57.111 --> 31:59.978
Melissa and Katie...

32:00.014 --> 32:01.263
congratulations.

32:01.315 --> 32:05.017
You guys are safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

32:09.023 --> 32:11.741
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week,

32:11.776 --> 32:14.527
and the judges would like to
find out more about your work.

32:14.562 --> 32:17.396
Robert and Johnny,
please step forward.

32:25.506 --> 32:28.090
Tell me how you
took your language

32:28.142 --> 32:30.076
and came up with this idea.

32:30.111 --> 32:32.778
Well, I heard some clicking
noises in the language,

32:32.814 --> 32:36.699
so I thought a beak might do
some clicking noises.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.801
It feels
like two different people

32:38.836 --> 32:43.589
working on a project that got
glued together in the end.

32:43.624 --> 32:47.343
Share with me how you split up
the work on this.

32:47.378 --> 32:49.995
I sculpted, molded,
and painted the cowl.

32:50.031 --> 32:52.698
I did the face piece
and the beak.

32:52.734 --> 32:55.701
We perhaps bit off a bit more
than we could chew.

32:55.737 --> 32:57.002
In terms of the cowl,

32:57.038 --> 32:58.838
I like a lot
of the stenciling and painting,

32:58.890 --> 33:00.806
but it doesn't really fit in
with Robert's face.

33:00.842 --> 33:02.475
That's my biggest complaint.

33:02.510 --> 33:03.709
Okay.

33:03.745 --> 33:05.611
I think the face
got really, really muddied,

33:05.646 --> 33:08.280
and from far away, it just looks
like he's inflamed.

33:08.282 --> 33:11.283
Also, from a distance,
it doesn't read like a beak.

33:11.285 --> 33:13.753
It just looks
like a big black hole.

33:13.788 --> 33:17.556
I think it was fine
to use squid metaphorically,

33:17.592 --> 33:19.125
but you went literally,

33:19.160 --> 33:23.429
and that makes this look silly
as a result.

33:23.464 --> 33:25.664
My concern was that
with the beak,

33:25.700 --> 33:27.700
they wouldn't be able to produce
a sound like...

33:27.702 --> 33:29.235
[pops lips]
For example.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.670
It doesn't quite work.

33:31.672 --> 33:34.056
Robert and Johnny, thank you.
You can step down.

33:34.092 --> 33:35.674
Thank you.

33:40.415 --> 33:42.648
Anna and Yvonne, you're next.

33:50.191 --> 33:51.323
Tell us about your concept.

33:51.359 --> 33:53.426
Our idea was
that this ancient tribe

33:53.461 --> 33:54.994
was trying to find a new place
to live.

33:55.029 --> 33:56.529
They came across a cave.

33:56.564 --> 33:59.064
Our character went in the cave,
put on the headdress,

33:59.100 --> 34:00.566
and he became the god,

34:00.601 --> 34:03.702
but he's not using
any of his powers for good.

34:03.738 --> 34:06.872
That's cool. That's what
this challenge is all about.

34:06.908 --> 34:09.542
To be able to see that
without you telling me that,

34:09.543 --> 34:12.344
- that's a successful makeup.
- Thank you.

34:12.380 --> 34:13.846
It's a great-looking
character,

34:13.848 --> 34:15.264
particularly the headdress,

34:15.315 --> 34:18.516
which I think
is really well done.

34:18.518 --> 34:20.886
That's so hard to do quickly.

34:20.922 --> 34:23.706
- I like him a great deal.
- Thank you.

34:23.741 --> 34:26.158
What I was looking for
was to make sure

34:26.210 --> 34:29.061
that nothing happened to him

34:29.096 --> 34:31.746
to prevent him from being able
to speak the language

34:31.799 --> 34:34.233
really quickly
and really fluently,

34:34.268 --> 34:36.936
and I was
extraordinarily pleased.

34:36.971 --> 34:38.036
So, very good job.

34:38.072 --> 34:39.538
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:39.574 --> 34:43.007
Anna and Yvonne,
you can head back.

34:49.550 --> 34:51.967
Njoroge and Ant,
please step to the center.

34:58.826 --> 34:59.959
So how did your language

34:59.994 --> 35:02.294
and artifacts give rise
to this character?

35:02.330 --> 35:04.730
We realized that they were
very limited in their dialect,

35:04.765 --> 35:07.066
therefore their other senses
would be heightened,

35:07.101 --> 35:10.236
hence the domed cranium
so they could hear better

35:10.271 --> 35:12.188
and the giant eyes
so they would see better.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.841
My biggest concern really just
comes down to execution.

35:17.512 --> 35:19.612
And it's mostly because

35:19.664 --> 35:23.115
of how you're handling
the detail.

35:23.150 --> 35:25.718
Are these scales on the muzzle?

35:25.720 --> 35:29.038
I don't know,
and that's a problem.

35:29.090 --> 35:31.590
Guys, tell me who sculpted
what on this makeup.

35:31.626 --> 35:33.325
I sculpted the cowl,

35:33.361 --> 35:35.160
and he sculpted the face.

35:35.196 --> 35:36.846
From a distance,
I didn't even know

35:36.881 --> 35:38.547
that it was supposed
to be reptilian,

35:38.599 --> 35:40.266
so that's really bad,

35:40.301 --> 35:42.868
and up close, I was hoping
that I was gonna see a lot more

35:42.904 --> 35:46.005
in the paint job that would make
me like it a little bit more,

35:46.040 --> 35:48.374
but, unfortunately,
it's just so flat.

35:48.409 --> 35:51.911
This is not
a successful makeup job.

35:51.946 --> 35:54.580
Njoroge and Ant, thank you.
If you'll please step down.

36:01.622 --> 36:05.291
Mel and Kaleb,
please come forward.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.382
- I like the headbands.
- [both chuckle]

36:13.417 --> 36:15.217
Tell me how your language

36:15.253 --> 36:17.536
and your artifacts
inspired your creation.

36:17.572 --> 36:20.990
We used a lot of the forms
we found in the artifacts,

36:21.042 --> 36:22.658
and for the language,

36:22.710 --> 36:26.045
it sounded like he spoke
on the inhale and the exhale,

36:26.097 --> 36:28.714
so we tried
to incorporate the bladder

36:28.749 --> 36:30.583
as a second breathing mechanism

36:30.585 --> 36:32.785
that allowed that language
to exist.

36:32.820 --> 36:34.370
- Outstanding work.
- Thank you so much.

36:34.405 --> 36:35.621
Thank you so much.

36:35.656 --> 36:36.906
Looking up close at your mouth

36:36.958 --> 36:38.524
with the two fangs
that come over,

36:38.559 --> 36:40.059
those sounds are impossible,

36:40.094 --> 36:44.530
but I had to ignore that because
I thought overall that you

36:44.565 --> 36:48.067
did a really outstanding job
incorporating the language.

36:48.119 --> 36:49.635
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

36:49.670 --> 36:51.003
Who did what on this makeup?

36:51.038 --> 36:53.322
Kaleb sculpted the face

36:53.357 --> 36:55.908
and fabricated
the whole headpiece.

36:55.943 --> 36:57.726
I was in charge
of the paint job,

36:57.762 --> 36:59.261
and I sculpted the cowl.

36:59.313 --> 37:00.813
I made the teeth
and the bladder.

37:00.848 --> 37:04.633
I think you created a really
great, cohesive character.

37:04.669 --> 37:09.121
I love the paint job on it,
and I love the bladder thing.

37:09.123 --> 37:10.289
He's a cool-looking dude.

37:10.324 --> 37:11.540
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

37:11.592 --> 37:14.109
It really feels
like a physical manifestation,

37:14.161 --> 37:16.528
an embodiment of the language,

37:16.564 --> 37:18.197
and that's what this challenge
was all about.

37:18.199 --> 37:20.866
Beyond that, I think you just
made a really creepy character.

37:20.868 --> 37:22.034
[both chuckle]

37:22.086 --> 37:24.269
Mel and Kaleb,
if you'd please step back.

37:24.271 --> 37:26.505
Thanks, man.
You did awesome.

37:28.442 --> 37:30.909
- Good job, you guys.
- Thank you.

37:30.911 --> 37:32.127
All right, thanks, guys.

37:32.163 --> 37:33.412
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

37:33.414 --> 37:34.546
while the judges deliberate.

37:34.582 --> 37:36.749
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:42.289 --> 37:43.956
All right, judges,
so just a reminder...

37:43.958 --> 37:46.158
you do have
that one-time special immunity

37:46.210 --> 37:48.077
that you may use if you wish.

37:48.129 --> 37:50.195
So, with that, why don't we
talk about your favorites?

37:50.231 --> 37:52.431
Let's start
with Yvonne and Anna.

37:52.466 --> 37:54.616
<i>Overall,
quite an exquisite character.</i>

37:54.652 --> 37:58.487
<i>That beautiful cowl helmet
piece that Yvonne sculpted</i>

37:58.539 --> 38:01.040
<i>stood out as a gem
of the entire makeup.</i>

38:01.075 --> 38:03.158
That works not only on its own,

38:03.194 --> 38:05.444
<i>but exceptionally well
with the face makeup.</i>

38:05.496 --> 38:09.715
I thought the whole thing all
together was beautifully done.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.051
All right, let's move
on to Mel and Kaleb.

38:12.086 --> 38:13.886
<i>Well, I think it was
incredible that they found time</i>

38:13.921 --> 38:16.255
to put a bladder in it because
he'd vocalized the language,

38:16.290 --> 38:17.790
and I thought
that was brilliant.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.491
They had those black lenses
in there,

38:19.527 --> 38:21.610
and you couldn't see anything
but that shiny black.

38:21.662 --> 38:22.945
<i>It tricked the eye into thinking</i>

38:22.997 --> 38:24.780
<i>there was a membrane
blinking inside there.</i>

38:24.832 --> 38:26.699
<i>It was very creepy.</i>

38:26.734 --> 38:28.183
All right,
so let's move on to the makeups

38:28.235 --> 38:29.618
that weren't so successful.

38:29.670 --> 38:32.237
Why don't we start
with Robert and Johnny?

38:32.273 --> 38:35.107
<i>The biggest misstep here
is the literalization</i>

38:35.159 --> 38:37.976
<i>of a squid as a head.</i>

38:37.978 --> 38:40.779
Not happy with the face
that Robert provided.

38:40.815 --> 38:42.247
<i>The biggest mistake, I think,</i>

38:42.249 --> 38:44.483
<i>is allowing the beak
to be completely visible.</i>

38:44.518 --> 38:47.686
In cephalopods, you don't just
roll up on it and see the beaks.

38:47.738 --> 38:49.571
I appreciate
that they were inspired

38:49.607 --> 38:51.190
by what they heard
in the language,

38:51.225 --> 38:53.542
but I believe they made
the wrong analysis.

38:53.594 --> 38:56.762
All right, and, finally,
Njoroge and Ant.

38:56.797 --> 38:58.097
<i>I don't know
what they were thinking.</i>

38:58.132 --> 39:01.033
<i>That was just a big old
green monster head,</i>

39:01.035 --> 39:02.367
<i>like a Halloween mask.</i>

39:02.403 --> 39:04.603
The thing's bulky.
It's asymmetrical.

39:04.638 --> 39:05.954
It's roughly sculpted,

39:06.006 --> 39:08.440
and the color,
the application of color...

39:08.476 --> 39:10.642
it's some of the worst
I've seen on this show.

39:10.678 --> 39:13.445
<i>The cowl, I felt, was subpar</i>

39:13.481 --> 39:15.230
<i>to what Njoroge had done
with the face.</i>

39:15.282 --> 39:16.882
<i>Even though the face
wasn't great,</i>

39:16.917 --> 39:18.784
the cowl was terrible.

39:18.819 --> 39:21.220
All right, then, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:21.222 --> 39:22.788
- We have.
- Yeah.

39:22.823 --> 39:25.390
Okay, let's bring them back out.

as well as the performance

all very successful.

some superb creative choices

39:50.084 --> 39:52.384
in your sculpture
that shouldn't have worked,

39:52.419 --> 39:53.786
but totally did,

39:53.821 --> 39:56.321
and he was the embodiment

40:30.610 --> 40:33.111
we can only have one winner.
Glenn?

40:33.146 --> 40:35.013
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

40:36.917 --> 40:39.317
Yvonne.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.319
- What?
- Yay.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.505
The headdress you created
was absolutely stunning.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.790
It was symmetrical, artistic,

40:45.826 --> 40:48.026
and it framed the makeup
perfectly.

40:48.028 --> 40:49.661
Thank you so much.

40:49.696 --> 40:51.112
<i>I really can't believe it.</i>

40:51.148 --> 40:53.581
I'm feeling
a lot more confident now,

40:53.617 --> 40:55.667
<i>especially being
bottom looks twice in a row.</i>

40:55.702 --> 40:57.102
<i>I don't want
to be down there again.</i>

40:57.137 --> 40:58.203
I want to stay up here.

40:58.238 --> 41:00.505
- Yvonne, congratulations.
- Thank you.

41:00.540 --> 41:03.692
You, Anna, Mel, and Kaleb
are all safe this week

41:03.744 --> 41:05.310
and can head back
to the makeup room.

41:05.345 --> 41:06.378
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.480
Thank you so much.

41:13.587 --> 41:15.270
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

41:15.322 --> 41:18.123
are on the bottom this week, and
one of you will be going home.

41:18.158 --> 41:20.125
Please step forward.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.567
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom teams.

41:29.603 --> 41:32.771
Njoroge and Ant, we felt that
the mouth treatment was cool,

41:32.806 --> 41:35.740
but your character suffered
from very poor technique

41:35.776 --> 41:37.409
and overall execution.

41:37.444 --> 41:41.046
Robert and Johnny, the squid
motif could have worked,

41:41.081 --> 41:43.815
but you both failed to put
any kind of unique spin

41:43.850 --> 41:46.501
or signature element
into the makeup.

41:46.553 --> 41:47.986
So who's going home tonight?

41:48.021 --> 41:50.321
The person
going home tonight is...

41:52.793 --> 41:55.026
Ant.

41:55.028 --> 41:56.778
The broad strokes
of your cowl were okay,

41:56.830 --> 41:59.397
but it lacked
any kind of texture, finesse,

41:59.399 --> 42:02.183
or areas of interest.

42:02.235 --> 42:05.637
Ant, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:05.672 --> 42:08.606
That means Njoroge, Robert,
and Johnny,

42:08.642 --> 42:09.774
you guys are safe this week

42:09.826 --> 42:12.143
and can head
back to the makeup room.

42:17.417 --> 42:19.684
In the short amount of time
that you've been here,

42:19.719 --> 42:20.869
one thing is very obvious.

42:20.904 --> 42:23.054
You're incredibly passionate
about your work,

42:23.090 --> 42:24.672
and that will take
you much further.

42:24.724 --> 42:27.208
I'm sure you have a very bright
future ahead of you.

42:27.244 --> 42:28.493
Thank you very much.

42:28.545 --> 42:31.279
Ant, it's been so great
having you here with us,

42:31.314 --> 42:33.331
but if you'd please head
back to the makeup room

42:33.383 --> 42:35.733
and pack up your kit.

42:35.769 --> 42:37.218
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:37.254 --> 42:38.503
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

42:38.555 --> 42:40.138
Good luck, honey.

42:40.173 --> 42:41.723
<i>I didn't make it as far
as I wanted to go,</i>

42:41.758 --> 42:44.008
<i>but I came here saying
I was gonna take risks,</i>

42:44.044 --> 42:45.310
and I felt like I did that.

42:47.497 --> 42:48.813
I'm going home.

42:48.815 --> 42:49.981
All: Aw.

42:49.983 --> 42:51.199
<i>I'm never gonna give up.</i>

42:51.234 --> 42:53.685
I love to do this,
and I want to continue to do it.

42:53.687 --> 42:56.253
I'm gonna continue to do makeup
the rest of my life.

42:57.958 --> 42:59.891
I was on Face Off,

42:59.927 --> 43:02.463
and that's something that I'll
be able to tell my kids one day.
