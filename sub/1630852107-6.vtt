[theme song playing]

00:45.378 --> 00:48.415
Okay, Petunia, you got this.

00:48.515 --> 00:50.617
Nice and easy.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.254
Just one, gentle...

00:55.088 --> 00:55.922
Tap!

00:56.723 --> 00:57.557
[whooshes]

00:57.624 --> 00:59.959
-[thuds] -[man] Ahhh...

01:00.060 --> 01:02.862
Ooh! That didn't sound too great.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.068
[groaning]

01:08.134 --> 01:09.569
Hello, sir,

01:09.636 --> 01:11.704
is everything croquet?

01:11.771 --> 01:13.807
I mean, okay?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.810
-[groaning] -[thuds]

01:16.910 --> 01:19.312
-[door opens] -what's going on out here?

01:19.412 --> 01:20.814
My gardener!

01:20.914 --> 01:23.883
-uh-oh! -[thudding]

01:23.950 --> 01:26.886
Are you responsible for this?

01:26.953 --> 01:28.154
Well, I uh, uh...

01:28.254 --> 01:31.558
Ugh! What am I to do without my gardener?

01:31.624 --> 01:35.829
And to think, he only had one weed left to pull.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.398
Jeez, I'm sorry, miss.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.733
But can't you just pull it yourself?

01:40.800 --> 01:46.673
Yuck! Filthy manual labor? That is beneath someone of my status.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.110
Well, I'm not above a little old fashioned hard work.

01:50.176 --> 01:54.080
And besides, I've got a real green thumb.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.519
-Hmm? -I've been meaning to get it checked out.

01:59.619 --> 02:04.257
Very well, one single weed shouldn't be too hard. But don't dilly dally.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.925
My party starts in 30 minutes

02:05.992 --> 02:08.261
and this garden must look perfect!

02:08.328 --> 02:09.863
Sure thing ma'am.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.433
It does look pretty in the sunlight.

02:15.268 --> 02:18.271
All right, let's weed out this weed

02:19.672 --> 02:22.375
Ha! It's a little stuck.

02:22.475 --> 02:27.480
Ah, that's okay, just got to put my back into it

02:27.547 --> 02:30.383
[shrieking]

02:30.483 --> 02:33.853
Gee, I don't know my own strength sometimes.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.355
Oh, let's just put it back.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.826
Hmm, looks a little scraggly though.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.296
This man's got a plan.

02:44.631 --> 02:46.733
We'll mow it down.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.537
-[engine sputtering] -[gasping]

02:52.839 --> 02:54.841
That doesn't look too bad.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.643
[engine accelerating]

02:56.709 --> 03:00.580
Welp, I hope that nice bear lady enjoys her party.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.984
Better get going and call it a day... Ahhh!

03:05.051 --> 03:08.721
-Ahh... ahh... ahh... -[engine whirring]

03:10.690 --> 03:13.359
-Ugh! -[engine whirring]

03:14.994 --> 03:16.563
[engine whirring]

03:16.663 --> 03:18.865
You know, that looks pretty good.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.500
[engine accelerating]

03:21.367 --> 03:22.602
That, not so much.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.673
I got to stop that wild lawnmower.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.175
Ooh!

03:29.242 --> 03:32.045
-[clanking] -Hmm, this should do it.

03:33.713 --> 03:36.849
-[engine accelerating] -[screaming]

03:37.684 --> 03:39.185
Phew!

03:39.252 --> 03:44.557
Whoo! That mower, boy, could have been a real disaster.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.759
[intense music playing]

03:46.859 --> 03:49.929
Ahhh! Oh, no, no, no, no!

03:50.029 --> 03:52.265
What am I gonna do?

03:52.365 --> 03:54.767
This leaf blower should get the job done.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.403
-[engine revs] -Good as new.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.139
[explosion]

04:00.240 --> 04:02.575
-No problem. -[engine whirring]

04:02.642 --> 04:04.744
Oh, it's fine.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.045
Not to worry.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.548
It's all good!

04:11.451 --> 04:13.786
[fire crackling]

04:13.886 --> 04:16.723
[intense music playing]

04:16.789 --> 04:20.927
-[chuckling] -Well fires do encourage new growth.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.396
[explosion]

04:25.832 --> 04:30.770
Okay! Now I've got some serious growing to do.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.940
I'll need lots of fertilizers if I want it to grow fast.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.310
But where am I gonna get that much this quickly?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.517
-[engine whirring] -[beeping]

04:44.617 --> 04:49.088
I'm sure those nice sanitation workers won't mind me borrowing their dump truck.

04:51.090 --> 04:51.958
[thudding]

04:54.961 --> 04:58.264
This ought to get those plants growing in no time.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.968
One man's trash is another plant's treasure.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.036
[thudding]

05:04.304 --> 05:05.171
[thuds]

05:05.271 --> 05:08.007
[singing]

05:08.107 --> 05:10.276
Drink up my thirsty friends.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.356
What have you done to my beautiful garden?

05:26.225 --> 05:28.861
Oh, Ms. Bear lady, is that you?

05:28.961 --> 05:31.831
Boy, that trash really brings out your eyes.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.838
What were you thinking?

05:38.905 --> 05:40.873
I was just trying to help.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.410
My tulips are trashed!

05:44.510 --> 05:47.246
My roses are ruined!

05:47.347 --> 05:50.249
My daffodils are decimated!

05:50.350 --> 05:52.919
Do you have any idea what you have done?

05:53.019 --> 05:55.922
You are the worst gardener I have ever had!

05:56.022 --> 05:58.991
All you had to do was pull one lousy weed

05:59.058 --> 06:02.261
and instead, you've utterly destroyed my entire yard.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.264
My party is doomed, and it's all thanks to you,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.266
you rotten, good for nothing!

06:07.367 --> 06:10.403
[crying hysterically] Ahhh...

06:10.503 --> 06:13.172
-[crying] -[Petunia] I'm sorry.

06:13.239 --> 06:15.441
[Petunia] I just wanted to help.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.845
[Petunia crying] I didn't mean to

06:18.911 --> 06:21.514
[crying hysterically] Ahhh...

06:21.581 --> 06:23.249
[Bear] Unbelievable!

06:26.686 --> 06:27.754
Oh, wow!

06:27.854 --> 06:29.956
It's nothing short of a miracle!

06:30.056 --> 06:32.458
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.927
No problem, ma'am, happy to help.

06:35.027 --> 06:37.397
I did tell you I had a green thumb.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.732
Yes, you certainly did.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.634
Yes, you did.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.136
[doorbell rings]

06:43.236 --> 06:44.637
Oh! That must be my guests.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.806
Take care neighbor.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.641
And thank you again.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.576
Have a nice party.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.478
-Ahhh! -[crashes]

06:52.578 --> 06:57.316
Yeesh, that croquet sure got me into a lot of trouble.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.887
I think it's time to try a more laid back hobby like um...

07:02.121 --> 07:04.223
Axe throwing.

07:04.290 --> 07:06.092
-Hyah! -[glass breaking]

07:06.159 --> 07:08.227
[Bear] Ahhh... My maid!

07:14.734 --> 07:16.769
-[door creaking] -[yawning]

07:18.004 --> 07:20.740
Well, ti... time to put the cat out.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.844
[grunting] Come on, Sylvester.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.579
You know the drill.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.316
Cats out at 06:40... 06:40...

07:31.250 --> 07:32.485
Quarter to seven.

[theme music playing]

08:19.799 --> 08:25.738
Yo... yoga seems like a nice, low key, relaxing workout for a porker like m... m...

08:25.838 --> 08:28.207
-...Yours truly. [chuckling] -[bell jingles]

08:29.509 --> 08:30.510
Uh...

08:30.576 --> 08:32.044
He... Hello.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.080
Whew! Where is everybody?

08:34.180 --> 08:38.918
-[instrumental music playing] -Om... om...

08:39.018 --> 08:40.586
Oh, um... E... Excuse me.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.657
-I... Is this a yo... yo... -Shh...

08:44.724 --> 08:47.693
Be with you in a second, chum, gotta clear my mind first.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.169
Ah! They don't come much clearer than that.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.504
[glass breaking]

08:58.571 --> 09:00.907
Okay, let's get started.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.943
We'll begin with some basic stretches.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.446
Lifting your arms up towards heavens.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.017
Inhaling gently as you lift. Good...

09:11.083 --> 09:18.257
On the exhale, we ease our legs off the ground and tuck our arms underneath.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.026
This is the boat pose.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.595
Good...

09:22.695 --> 09:24.463
Yep, this feels nice.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.533
Next is the traditional, "up dog" pose.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.902
Er, ok, let's see...

09:29.969 --> 09:31.304
Just gotta...

09:31.404 --> 09:33.139
Ohhh! Ain't not... not bad...

09:33.239 --> 09:35.875
Now we're going to go a bit faster.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.984
These are basic exercises.

09:45.084 --> 09:45.952
Nothing to them.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.219
Ain't that right, fellas?

09:47.286 --> 09:48.888
Oh, yeah! You betcha.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.427
You didn't keep your chakras aligned.

09:54.493 --> 09:56.462
[stuttering] ...chakras?

09:56.562 --> 09:58.998
Next pose... The hooting horse.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.302
[grunting] ...why is it called the hooting ho...

10:03.402 --> 10:09.075
[Daffy] Whoo... Whoo... Whoo... Whoo... Whoo... Whoo-hoo...

10:10.109 --> 10:12.612
Next is the laughing lunge.

10:18.584 --> 10:22.288
[laughing] Cut it out.

10:22.989 --> 10:23.956
Ahhh...

10:25.324 --> 10:27.627
[cymbals crashing]

10:27.693 --> 10:30.196
Hey, quit fooling around with the sacred gong.

10:31.764 --> 10:32.665
Ugh!

10:34.166 --> 10:37.470
And for crying out loud, watch those chakras!

10:37.536 --> 10:40.206
Now then, amateur hour is over.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.642
Time for the advanced techniques.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.144
[stuttering] ...Advanced?

10:45.845 --> 10:47.346
Ready...

10:47.446 --> 10:48.881
Gi... Give me a few more minutes.

10:48.981 --> 10:49.882
[Duffy] Wrinkled monkey!

10:49.982 --> 10:50.883
Oh, um...

10:51.550 --> 10:52.351
[squeaking]

10:52.451 --> 10:53.786
[Duffy] Burning snake!

10:53.853 --> 10:54.887
Um...

10:54.987 --> 10:57.556
[hissing] Ooh... Ahh... Ouch!

10:57.657 --> 10:58.658
[Daffy] Sneaky turtle.

10:59.725 --> 11:00.626
Wet giraffe.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.728
Tail-biting beaver.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.530
Tango dancing tucan.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.831
Dizzy iguana.

11:05.898 --> 11:09.035
Reverse hummingbird. Faceplanting mule.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.136
Fidgety alligator.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.404
Raging rabbit!

11:11.504 --> 11:12.371
Shivering yak.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.673
Exploding Moose!

11:13.739 --> 11:14.740
[explosion]

11:14.840 --> 11:18.077
[wheezing]

11:18.177 --> 11:21.514
Yup, mmm-hmm, and those are my favorite animals in the zoo.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.548
No, thank you.

11:22.648 --> 11:25.384
I love taking surveys. Buh-bye.

11:25.484 --> 11:30.656
[stuttering] ...What kind of yoga... guru are you?

11:30.723 --> 11:32.024
[door slams]

11:32.091 --> 11:36.328
[grumbles]

11:36.395 --> 11:39.331
Hang it cheapskate, you didn't pay for the session.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.766
-[thuds] -[Porky] Ahhh...

11:40.866 --> 11:42.368
Uh...

11:43.769 --> 11:45.104
Sheesh...

11:45.204 --> 11:47.673
Some guys just can't keep their chakras aligned.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.614
[theme music playing]
