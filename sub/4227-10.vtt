WEBVTT

00:00.324 --> 00:02.300
Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.325 --> 00:03.250
We have to beat them.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.125
We will.

00:04.150 --> 00:06.278
We'll see each other again.
I promise.

00:06.303 --> 00:07.976
We can ally
with the rebel Skitters

00:08.000 --> 00:09.420
and hit the Overlords
with everything we got.

00:09.445 --> 00:11.489
I will <i>not</i>
<i>jeopardize this city --</i>

00:11.514 --> 00:12.637
I was told to find you --

00:12.662 --> 00:14.156
that you were the only one
who would understand.

00:14.181 --> 00:14.852
Who sent you?

00:14.877 --> 00:16.853
The one with the red eye --
the leader of the rebellion.

00:16.878 --> 00:17.971
Some of them
must have known

00:17.996 --> 00:19.793
that Tom would try to reach out
to his rebel Skitters.

00:19.818 --> 00:21.320
So you're locking us up?

00:21.345 --> 00:23.200
Drop your weapons
and step back!

00:23.225 --> 00:25.190
The civilian
government's been suspended.

00:25.215 --> 00:27.263
Charleston is
now under martial law.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.274
Your damned alliance
is gonna kill us all.

00:30.452 --> 00:32.104
You wanna make that rendezvous
with your rebel Skitters,

00:32.204 --> 00:34.004
I suggest you suck it up --
and fast.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.114
Nice work, boys.

00:36.148 --> 00:37.648
Looks like you dropped us

00:37.683 --> 00:40.681
in the middle
of a good, old-fashioned coup.

00:40.716 --> 00:42.016
Shut up, Pope.

00:42.051 --> 00:43.082
Why now, General?

00:43.117 --> 00:44.784
What were you waiting for?

00:44.819 --> 00:47.184
The perfect scapegoat?
The 2nd Mass?

00:47.218 --> 00:49.486
I've been waiting
for Dr. Manchester

00:49.520 --> 00:50.754
to come to his senses.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.524
And patiently,
I might add.

00:52.558 --> 00:54.895
And I was acting in the best
interest of our citizens.

00:54.929 --> 00:59.668
The people voted for civil rule,
not for a military junta.

00:59.702 --> 01:01.739
Don't be so naive,
Arthur.

01:01.773 --> 01:05.643
Eventually,
the aliens will find us.

01:05.678 --> 01:09.746
We have no choice <i>but</i> to go
on the offensive -- now.

01:11.884 --> 01:15.221
You with us...or not?

01:15.255 --> 01:16.889
Not this way.

01:16.924 --> 01:18.058
I'm sorry, General,

01:18.092 --> 01:19.760
but my vision
of the new United States

01:19.794 --> 01:21.762
doesn't begin
with a military coup.

01:21.797 --> 01:24.200
I'll agree that Arthur may have lost
sight of some of the original goals,

01:24.235 --> 01:27.604
but to put him in jail,
declare martial law?

01:27.639 --> 01:29.573
Your actions are misguided,
sir.

01:29.608 --> 01:32.211
I would have assumed,
given its reputation,

01:32.245 --> 01:34.980
the 2nd Mass
would be chomping at the bit

01:35.015 --> 01:37.684
for the chance
to take it to the enemy.

01:37.719 --> 01:40.888
I guess I assumed wrong.

01:40.923 --> 01:43.592
Lock them up!
Get them inside!

01:46.330 --> 01:48.699
Appreciate the solidarity,
Tom.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.902
This has nothing to do with you,
Arthur. Believe me.

01:52.972 --> 01:55.106
That's an outer security
perimeter breach!

01:55.141 --> 01:57.276
Let's move!
Let's move!

02:04.085 --> 02:05.953
Move! Move!

02:07.288 --> 02:08.622
Prepare to fire!

02:10.158 --> 02:11.226
Stand by!

02:14.129 --> 02:16.031
General, wait!
Those are the rebels.

02:16.065 --> 02:17.299
How can you be sure?

02:17.334 --> 02:18.968
The one with the red eye --
I know him.

02:19.002 --> 02:21.972
I said,
"prepare to fire"!

02:22.006 --> 02:24.174
Stop!

02:24.209 --> 02:26.377
We're not here
to hurt anyone.

02:26.411 --> 02:28.313
Ben.

02:32.852 --> 02:33.953
Are you all right?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.155
Ben!

02:36.189 --> 02:38.824
General, tell your men
to lower their weapons.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.707
Hold your fire.

03:23.742 --> 03:24.875

We'll begin,

04:04.086 --> 04:06.121
It is good to see you again,
Professor.

04:07.891 --> 04:10.693
I'm sorry that our last meeting
had to end so badly.

04:10.727 --> 04:14.664
No one is to blame,
except perhaps our mutual enemy.

04:16.601 --> 04:18.969
What the hell
is going on here?

04:19.003 --> 04:21.637
The Skitter talks through
a human. Don't ask me how.

04:23.174 --> 04:27.010
What, uh...
What brings you here?

04:27.045 --> 04:30.147
Captain Weaver, I'm not sure
you realize the prize you had

04:30.182 --> 04:32.750
when you captured the Overlord
last week.

04:32.784 --> 04:35.919
We didn't want any prize.
We were just trying to survive.

04:35.954 --> 04:37.121
Understandable.

04:37.156 --> 04:39.924
That particular Overlord,
however,

04:39.959 --> 04:41.860
oversees
all military operations

04:41.894 --> 04:43.995
in the eastern part
of this continent,

04:44.029 --> 04:46.765
and I am sure that
if you had suspected his value,

04:46.799 --> 04:49.067
you would not
have let him live.

04:49.102 --> 04:51.136
How can one fish-head
be that important?

04:51.171 --> 04:53.038
The greatest strength
of the Overlords,

04:53.072 --> 04:54.907
is also
their most profound weakness.

04:54.941 --> 04:56.675
The Eshpeni,
as they are called,

04:56.709 --> 04:58.710
have unimaginable
intellectual capacity,

04:58.744 --> 05:01.012
which means they have no need
for computational

05:01.046 --> 05:03.614
or information-storage devices,
such as computers.

05:03.649 --> 05:05.016
They keep everything
in their heads?

05:05.050 --> 05:06.484
In a manner of speaking,
yes.

05:06.519 --> 05:08.120
Each one of them
controls huge sections

05:08.154 --> 05:10.188
of their interplanetary
operations.

05:10.223 --> 05:12.824
But because they speak
through many harnessed species,

05:12.859 --> 05:14.159
such as ourselves,

05:14.193 --> 05:16.595
our oppressors must
keep their plans secret.

05:16.629 --> 05:19.064
I don't see
how any of this concerns us.

05:19.099 --> 05:21.834
General, if that Overlord
had been killed,

05:21.868 --> 05:24.170
alien operations
in this part of the world

05:24.204 --> 05:28.808
would have been thrown
into complete and utter chaos.

05:28.842 --> 05:30.075
You still haven't answered

05:30.110 --> 05:32.644
why this information
is relevant <i>now.</i>

05:32.679 --> 05:34.212
We have gained access,
through our operatives,

05:34.237 --> 05:35.714
to the Eshpeni's movements.

05:35.715 --> 05:37.049
We know
when and where he will be

05:37.083 --> 05:39.051
and, more importantly,
when he will be vulnerable.

05:39.085 --> 05:40.853
Where?

05:40.887 --> 05:43.656
A large weapon is being
constructed on the 35th parallel

05:43.690 --> 05:45.190
not 500 miles from here.

05:45.225 --> 05:46.892
What kind of weapon?
What's its purpose?

05:46.927 --> 05:48.761
We were not able
to acquire that information.

05:48.795 --> 05:50.562
Besides, it's not relevant
for our purposes.

05:50.597 --> 05:53.199
What we do know is that
the Overlord will be there

05:53.233 --> 05:55.835
to inspect its progress
three days from now.

05:55.869 --> 05:58.271
So, we just walk in
and kill the damn thing?

05:58.305 --> 06:00.939
Surely there are
defense mechanisms in place.

06:00.974 --> 06:02.741
On the surface, but...

06:02.776 --> 06:05.077
Underground caves
and narrow limestone fissures

06:05.111 --> 06:06.912
lead right up
to the outside

06:06.946 --> 06:09.648
of the buried section
of the facility.

06:09.682 --> 06:11.851
If you have all this
information, why do you need us?

06:11.885 --> 06:13.853
We cannot enter the area
undetected.

06:13.887 --> 06:16.722
They will sense our presence
because of our harnesses.

06:16.757 --> 06:18.624
Also, we lack the weapons

06:18.659 --> 06:20.993
needed to breach the compound
and eliminate the Overlord.

06:21.027 --> 06:24.930
This is why we have
exposed ourselves

06:24.965 --> 06:26.799
and turned to you for help.

06:27.967 --> 06:32.004
Well, uh, that's, uh...
a lot of information to digest.

06:32.038 --> 06:35.307
We're gonna need some time
to sort this out.

06:35.342 --> 06:38.311
As you wish.

06:38.345 --> 06:39.845
We will wait
outside the city.

06:39.880 --> 06:44.116
But time is...of the essence,
General.

06:44.151 --> 06:46.119
A target of opportunity
such as this

06:46.153 --> 06:47.954
rarely presents itself
twice.

06:49.056 --> 06:50.289
Agreed.

07:08.309 --> 07:09.977
You have to leave, too?

07:10.011 --> 07:11.746
You can't stay
just for a night?

07:11.780 --> 07:13.180
Your brothers
would love it.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.748
I can't.

07:14.783 --> 07:16.317
At least not yet.

07:18.987 --> 07:20.287
Got to go.

07:23.659 --> 07:25.626
Gentlemen,
I don't mind telling you --

07:25.661 --> 07:29.163
I've never heard a bigger crock
of bull crap in my life.

07:29.197 --> 07:30.898
Sir,
I know how it seems,

07:30.932 --> 07:33.167
but, reluctantly,
I've come to believe

07:33.201 --> 07:35.169
that the rebel Skitters
are real.

07:35.203 --> 07:38.372
I am not sending my forces
on a wild goose chase

07:38.407 --> 07:41.742
with some red-eyed monster,
no matter how real they may be!

07:41.776 --> 07:44.111
General, I've known Dan Weaver
and Tom Mason for a long --

07:44.145 --> 07:45.646
well,
this discussion is over.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.181
Sergeant, take these men
back to their cages

07:47.215 --> 07:48.849
and secure
the outside perimeter.

07:48.884 --> 07:50.918
Those damn things
come within 10 meters of here,

07:50.952 --> 07:51.919
shoot them on sight.

07:51.953 --> 07:53.120
Yes, sir.

07:53.155 --> 07:54.422
My son is still out there
with them.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.958
Regrettable,
but hardly my responsibility.

07:58.327 --> 08:00.361
What happened to "Let's take
the fight to the enemy," general?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.030
You're out of line,
Professor.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.031
Sir!

08:04.733 --> 08:07.034
What is it, Captain?
I'm losing my patience here.

08:07.068 --> 08:08.369
You're right, sir.

08:08.403 --> 08:11.338
It's insane
to risk Charleston's army

08:11.373 --> 08:13.774
for a mission
so dangerous.

08:13.808 --> 08:15.376
But I do know
one fighting unit

08:15.410 --> 08:17.878
that's capable of carrying out
this mission successfully,

08:17.913 --> 08:19.680
and that's the 2nd Mass.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.282
Sorry, Captain Weaver,

08:21.316 --> 08:22.683
but I'm not willing to risk
even <i>your</i> sorry unit.

08:22.718 --> 08:24.252
It's suicide.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.421
We've been living at the razor's
edge of death for so long

08:26.455 --> 08:27.822
we don't know
any different.

08:27.857 --> 08:29.891
And besides,
you know we're just gonna be

08:29.926 --> 08:32.160
a thorn in your backside
as long as we hang around here.

08:32.195 --> 08:33.830
Am I wrong, Tom?

08:33.864 --> 08:36.065
Quite correct, Captain.
In fact, I'd make it my career.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.371
Fine.

08:42.407 --> 08:45.342
Muster your fighters.

08:45.377 --> 08:48.379
You can reconnoiter
with your Skitter friends

08:48.413 --> 08:50.314
outside the complex.

08:50.348 --> 08:52.416
Dismissed.

08:59.124 --> 09:02.894
Sergeant Clemons, I'm sure
I don't have to tell you

09:02.928 --> 09:06.932
that we have a target
of opportunity here, Sergeant.

09:06.966 --> 09:09.067
And it's waiting
right outside this complex.

09:09.102 --> 09:11.002
You mean the Skitters.

09:11.037 --> 09:12.104
Exactly.

09:12.138 --> 09:14.940
Get your men ready.

09:14.975 --> 09:17.142
I don't want
a single Skitter bastard

09:17.176 --> 09:18.377
left alive by morning.

09:18.411 --> 09:19.511
Yes, sir.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.367
Hey, Ben!

09:53.655 --> 09:55.822
What are you doing here,
Hal?

09:59.126 --> 10:00.861
Can't a guy
see his brother?

10:22.149 --> 10:24.517
You're not sleeping like <i>that,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

10:24.552 --> 10:27.387
Tried it. Blood rushed
to my head, and I passed out.

10:27.422 --> 10:28.889
Guess I'm human
after all.

10:28.923 --> 10:30.757
I-I didn't mean it
like that.

10:30.791 --> 10:32.659
I'm joking.

10:32.693 --> 10:35.495
Seriously,
why did you come here?

10:35.529 --> 10:37.129
Seriously, to see you.

10:38.832 --> 10:41.433
I know things got
a little crazy between us,

10:41.468 --> 10:42.902
and, well, um...

10:44.504 --> 10:46.939
I just want to say
I'm sorry.

10:46.974 --> 10:50.143
For my part in it,
I'm -- I'm really sorry.

10:52.112 --> 10:54.447
I'm sorry, too.

10:54.481 --> 10:57.450
Nothing seems to have made a lot
of sense recently, does it?

10:58.652 --> 10:59.819
Amen to that.

11:00.988 --> 11:03.089
Until now.

11:03.124 --> 11:04.924
Really?

11:04.959 --> 11:06.926
How so?

11:06.961 --> 11:09.863
I think I found
the place I belong.

11:09.897 --> 11:12.065
You mean here --
with the Skitters?

11:12.100 --> 11:13.934
Yeah.

11:13.968 --> 11:16.069
Your place is
with your family, doofus.

11:16.104 --> 11:17.204
Hal.

11:17.238 --> 11:18.205
No, seriously,
listen to me.

11:18.239 --> 11:19.840
Dad needs you.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.675
I mean, we <i>all</i> need you.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.078
All right? You had your fun.
Now it's time to come home.

11:25.147 --> 11:27.682
The world doesn't
work that way anymore.

11:31.621 --> 11:33.455
You know,
it wasn't that long ago

11:33.489 --> 11:36.058
we were fighting
side-by-side.

11:36.092 --> 11:37.726
We made quite a team,
remember?

11:37.760 --> 11:38.794
We did.

11:40.029 --> 11:41.763
But...

11:43.866 --> 11:45.867
You're staying.

11:45.901 --> 11:47.469
With them.

11:47.503 --> 11:49.504
Yes.

11:54.909 --> 11:56.243
Boy,
you can be frustrating.

11:56.277 --> 11:59.979
I'm a younger brother.
That's what we do.

12:00.014 --> 12:01.948
I suppose.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.684
But, uh...

12:04.718 --> 12:06.819
you're so damn good
at it.

12:17.098 --> 12:19.166
Be careful, okay?

12:19.201 --> 12:21.602
You too.

12:35.951 --> 12:39.020
Well, this is
a short-lived paradise.

12:39.054 --> 12:42.790
Honestly, I'm happy
to get back on the front line.

12:42.824 --> 12:44.558
I never thought
I'd say it,

12:44.592 --> 12:46.626
but there's something
about the...

12:47.728 --> 12:49.295
Rush?

12:49.330 --> 12:52.298
Yeah.
I suppose that's it.

12:52.332 --> 12:54.633
Maybe we've just been
fighting so long,

12:54.668 --> 12:56.235
we don't know
anything else.

12:56.269 --> 12:58.537
I know...

12:58.571 --> 13:00.672
I'm sorry.

13:00.707 --> 13:02.141
Um...

13:02.175 --> 13:03.275
Ohh...

13:08.181 --> 13:09.181
Are you okay?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.251
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:12.285 --> 13:14.820
It's nothing.

13:19.259 --> 13:20.659
Tom know?

13:22.995 --> 13:24.896
That I'm pregnant?

13:25.898 --> 13:27.832
No.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.901
And I'm not
gonna tell him

13:29.936 --> 13:32.103
till we're back
from this mission.

13:35.141 --> 13:36.108
Okay.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.849
House arrest.

13:45.118 --> 13:47.986
Could he possibly be
more humiliating?

13:48.021 --> 13:49.822
I built this community.

13:49.856 --> 13:53.258
I invited Bressler here
to join us, for God's sake.

13:53.293 --> 13:55.728
The general
crossed the line.

13:55.762 --> 13:57.797
No question.

13:57.831 --> 13:59.999
But you got to take
some responsibility

14:00.033 --> 14:01.333
for what's happened here.

14:01.368 --> 14:04.369
Oh, I suppose.
I suppose so.

14:06.105 --> 14:09.741
Yes, yes, I made
some errors in judgment.

14:09.775 --> 14:11.742
And the general
is not an evil man, Tom.

14:11.776 --> 14:16.012
The only problem is
that he thinks with his...

14:16.047 --> 14:17.614
rifle.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.850
Arthur, I've never known you
to be one for metaphors.

14:20.884 --> 14:23.286
Oh. Well, in this case,
apt, no?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.954
Without question.

14:24.988 --> 14:27.657
When Colonel Porter teamed
Dan Weaver and I up together,

14:27.691 --> 14:28.992
I thought he was insane.

14:29.026 --> 14:31.394
I half expected him
to kill me in my sleep.

14:31.429 --> 14:34.331
But somehow, some way,
we found a middle ground.

14:34.366 --> 14:37.401
But we both know
the dangers of military rule.

14:37.436 --> 14:38.837
Perhaps,
but as I've said,

14:38.871 --> 14:41.039
we can't just
tuck our heads in the sand

14:41.073 --> 14:43.208
and pretend
the aliens aren't out there.

14:43.242 --> 14:46.745
Meaning that
you're going on this...

14:46.779 --> 14:47.912
suicide mission.

14:47.947 --> 14:49.114
Yes.

14:51.984 --> 14:54.419
Dad...our camp --
we were attacked.

15:01.254 --> 15:02.823
This isn't Red-Eye.

15:02.824 --> 15:05.091
I don't see him.
Where is he?

15:05.126 --> 15:07.627
He and a few others
got away.

15:07.662 --> 15:10.497
You sure you can't get
me anything at all on the attackers?

15:10.531 --> 15:12.098
Even the smallest detail
might be helpful.

15:12.132 --> 15:14.767
No. It was dark. All I could see
was muzzle flashes.

15:14.801 --> 15:16.602
They came from over there.

15:16.637 --> 15:18.971
We ran in every direction, and
then someone hit me in the head.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.007
"We"?

15:21.041 --> 15:22.708
You mean...
the Skitters?

15:22.743 --> 15:25.777
And the other
de-harnessed kids.

15:25.812 --> 15:28.446
No boot prints.
Shell casings everywhere.

15:28.481 --> 15:30.115
5.56 and 7.62s.

15:30.149 --> 15:33.384
Ehh. 90% of the weapons
in Charleston fire these.

15:33.419 --> 15:35.553
You know,
we came here in trust.

15:35.587 --> 15:37.054
All right, all right.
Calm down, son.

15:37.089 --> 15:38.589
Calm down?
He was almost killed.

15:38.623 --> 15:40.058
I understand why you're upset,
Professor.

15:40.092 --> 15:41.426
If he were <i>my</i> boy --

15:41.460 --> 15:42.760
It <i>wasn't</i> your boy.

15:42.794 --> 15:45.963
No. My son
was killed by a Skitter.

15:47.967 --> 15:49.667
Right in front of me.

15:49.701 --> 15:51.836
Almost everyone in Charleston

15:51.870 --> 15:54.438
has seen loved ones
murdered by those things.

15:54.473 --> 15:56.974
Is it any wonder that some got
carried away with our emotions?

15:57.008 --> 15:59.743
You're not condoning the attack,
are you, General?

15:59.777 --> 16:01.478
I'm saying
what happened <i>happened.</i>

16:01.512 --> 16:03.813
End of story.
Game over.

16:03.847 --> 16:05.481
I'm canceling
the mission.

16:07.150 --> 16:08.551
You can't do that!

16:08.585 --> 16:10.485
Those are my orders.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.720
Dad.

16:11.754 --> 16:13.689
We have to go
on this mission.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.557
This is about more than the rebels,
more than the Overlord.

16:17.493 --> 16:20.429
This weapon will wipe out
<i>everything</i> if it's finished.

16:20.463 --> 16:22.731
Red-Eye didn't have
any information on the weapon.

16:22.765 --> 16:24.533
He didn't know whether he could
trust Bressler and the others.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.768
I understand.
It's just --

16:25.802 --> 16:27.102
I have the plan,
the layout in my head.

16:27.137 --> 16:29.805
I can -- I can get us there.
I can get us in.

16:32.042 --> 16:33.475
Captain?

16:33.509 --> 16:35.444
Get in and out
before they can react.

16:35.478 --> 16:38.813
It's gonna be
a much smaller team, but...yes.

16:38.848 --> 16:39.881
Hell yes.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.817
General!

16:43.586 --> 16:44.753
What is it?

16:44.787 --> 16:46.989
Sir,
with all due respect,

16:47.023 --> 16:49.958
the 2nd Mass
is going on the mission.

16:49.992 --> 16:51.059
I just gave you an order.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.861
I understand that,
sir.

16:52.895 --> 16:56.898
But we're doing it nonetheless,
with or without your permission.

17:02.737 --> 17:05.806
Fine.
You've got my permission.

17:07.642 --> 17:08.842
Sir.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.721
Here you go.

17:19.755 --> 17:23.025
Get your packs loaded!
Weapons ready!

17:25.194 --> 17:27.863
It's good to see you
dressed all normal-like, Cap.

17:27.896 --> 17:31.767
You said it, Dai. It enhances
the captain's rugged good looks.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.503
Yeah, the captain
is stylin' now.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.839
All right. Stow it.

17:36.874 --> 17:40.777
Or...this "stylin'," "rugged,"
size-11 boot

17:40.811 --> 17:43.213
will commence
to kicking some ass!

17:48.886 --> 17:50.754
Hey, Jeanne,
w-what are you doing?

17:50.788 --> 17:53.023
What's it look like, Dad?
Getting geared up.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.894
Oh, no.
No, you're not going with us.

17:57.928 --> 18:00.797
I think I can handle myself
in combat.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.965
There's no question
about that.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.967
You need fighters
you can depend on.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.868
Yeah.
We do, of course.

18:06.903 --> 18:08.670
But that's not
the point.

18:08.704 --> 18:09.871
It <i>is.</i>

18:12.074 --> 18:14.175
You need to be <i>here --</i>
<i>in Charleston.</i>

18:14.209 --> 18:15.810
C-Charleston?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.580
No, Dad, my place is
by your side -- fighting.

18:18.614 --> 18:20.815
Sweetheart...

18:23.285 --> 18:28.189
...the truth is --
the real truth --

18:28.223 --> 18:30.892
I can't bear the idea
of losing you again.

18:32.895 --> 18:33.995
Well, same here.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.898
At least
we'll die together.

18:35.932 --> 18:38.300
It's better than waiting
for you to come home.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.104
Well <i>somebody's</i>
<i>got to survive this war,</i>

18:41.138 --> 18:44.107
finish
what's been started here.

18:44.141 --> 18:45.842
And you know what?

18:45.877 --> 18:51.315
After seeing you stand up
to Manchester at the forum...

18:51.349 --> 18:53.918
I believe...

18:53.952 --> 18:57.988
I <i>know</i>
<i>that you're such a person.</i>

19:03.028 --> 19:06.864
Bu-- I just -- I don't
want you to die, papa bear.

19:06.899 --> 19:08.866
Aw, don't you worry about that,
baby bear.

19:08.901 --> 19:12.103
You know your papa's
way too ornery to die.

19:20.111 --> 19:22.646
I didn't know
you could draw.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.980
Neither did I.

19:24.014 --> 19:25.782
One of the many benefits
of being harnessed.

19:25.816 --> 19:26.983
I'm impressed.

19:27.018 --> 19:29.018
What's that thing?

19:29.053 --> 19:32.055
Well, it's my specialty.
I call it "the wall crasher."

19:32.089 --> 19:33.222
Say what?

19:33.257 --> 19:35.024
Blow a hole in anything,
anywhere.

19:35.059 --> 19:36.359
Sounds good to me.

19:36.393 --> 19:37.893
Finally, after all these months
of running,

19:37.928 --> 19:39.061
we're taking the fight
to <i>them.</i>

19:39.096 --> 19:40.062
Tick, tick...

19:40.097 --> 19:41.330
Boom!
Boom!

19:42.966 --> 19:45.635
We could have used a couple
of these babies a while back.

19:45.669 --> 19:49.005
Yeah, well, got them <i>now.</i>
<i>That's all that counts.</i>

19:49.040 --> 19:50.974
We'll see you
on the flip side, Jim.

19:51.008 --> 19:52.275
Bring them home.

19:53.945 --> 19:56.246
All right, move it!
This ain't no coach tour.

19:56.281 --> 19:58.315
Really, Cap? I thought we were
going to see the Grand Canyon.

19:58.350 --> 19:59.316
Hey!

20:03.322 --> 20:05.790
Bro, you got steel-plated
cojones showing up here

20:05.825 --> 20:07.292
after putting a hole
in my arm.

20:07.327 --> 20:09.695
I'm sorry about that, Lyle.
I truly am.

20:09.729 --> 20:11.263
Clemons was gonna
kill you.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.066
What happened to your uniform,
soldier boy?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.901
Threw it
in the incinerator.

20:15.935 --> 20:18.036
Should have known better than
to put it on in the first place.

20:18.070 --> 20:19.972
Didn't like
what it did to my head.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.342
So, you want
to take me back, Pope?

20:24.377 --> 20:26.211
I got my mind right.

20:26.246 --> 20:29.848
Now, what do <i>you</i> think
I should do with you, Tector?

20:29.882 --> 20:32.484
I suppose
that's up to you.

20:33.753 --> 20:35.321
Indeed it is.

20:35.355 --> 20:36.722
Drive the truck.

20:40.293 --> 20:41.260
Dad!

20:41.294 --> 20:43.028
Hey, buddy.

20:43.063 --> 20:45.164
I wanted
to wish you good hunting.

20:45.198 --> 20:46.298
Thank you.

20:46.332 --> 20:49.134
I'll be back
in a couple of days.

20:49.169 --> 20:50.336
I know.

20:50.370 --> 20:51.704
What else?

20:51.738 --> 20:54.207
It's just, uh...

20:54.241 --> 20:56.844
well, I thought I'd proved
myself as a good fighter.

20:56.878 --> 20:58.178
Seriously,
you're the best.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.780
Then why aren't you
taking me with you?

21:01.750 --> 21:03.718
Isn't it obvious?

21:03.752 --> 21:05.219
Well, no.

21:05.254 --> 21:07.088
Lourdes.

21:07.123 --> 21:10.092
She's had kind of a tough time
lately with Jamil and all.

21:10.126 --> 21:11.882
I needed to make sure
that there's somebody here

21:11.907 --> 21:13.907
that can keep her safe.

21:14.263 --> 21:15.263
Oh.

21:15.298 --> 21:16.498
Roger that, Dad.

21:19.902 --> 21:23.205
You don't
have to come with this.

21:23.239 --> 21:25.173
You mean just leave
the little woman at home

21:25.208 --> 21:27.309
while you men go off
and fight the big, bad alien?

21:27.343 --> 21:28.877
That's not
how I meant it.

21:28.911 --> 21:30.779
I've seen you around blood,
Tom Mason.

21:30.813 --> 21:32.981
You turn three shades of green
at the sight of it.

21:33.015 --> 21:35.383
Wouldn't want anyone bleeding out
while I wasn't there to prevent it.

21:38.987 --> 21:40.521
Hey.

21:40.556 --> 21:43.358
Take care of yourself,
okay?

21:43.392 --> 21:44.359
Let's roll.

21:44.393 --> 21:45.927
Don't want to be late

21:45.961 --> 21:48.029
for our date
with that stinking fish-head.

22:06.277 --> 22:08.945
This tunnel is endless.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.180
You all right?

22:10.214 --> 22:11.781
Yeah.

22:11.816 --> 22:14.584
I'm just not good
in tight, cramped places.

22:14.618 --> 22:16.286
You should have told me.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.788
You could have stayed back at
the trucks with Lyle and Crazy Lee.

22:18.823 --> 22:21.691
Don't start this again,
okay?

22:21.726 --> 22:23.827
You're right.
I'm sorry.

22:23.861 --> 22:25.062
Old habits.

22:26.864 --> 22:28.866
Sweet,
in a retro sort of way.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.000
But...

22:30.034 --> 22:31.135
I get it.

22:31.169 --> 22:32.870
Enough said.

22:37.775 --> 22:38.875
I was thinking...

22:38.910 --> 22:40.577
Yeah?

22:40.611 --> 22:42.312
I was thinking this would be
a good place for crawlies.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.849
Thanks for that thought.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.656
Seriously, though.

22:53.690 --> 22:55.991
If we don't find the exit door
to this ride...

22:57.293 --> 22:58.593
I just want to say --

22:58.627 --> 22:59.994
Don't.

23:00.029 --> 23:02.597
Okay? We're gonna make it.
We always do.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.132
But, Hal,
what if we don't?

23:04.166 --> 23:05.867
We will.

23:16.178 --> 23:19.180
The chamber's
on the other side of the wall.

23:22.051 --> 23:23.852
It matches the layout.

23:23.886 --> 23:26.822
Go on and set her up.
Come on.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.206
Dad...

23:44.240 --> 23:46.875
He's here.
I can feel it.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.877
Okay.

23:48.912 --> 23:50.646
We'll go face the bastard
together,

23:50.680 --> 23:52.781
make sure he doesn't
get off the planet alive.

23:58.455 --> 24:00.022
How we doing, boys?

24:00.056 --> 24:01.824
A few more seconds.

24:01.858 --> 24:02.925
All right.

24:02.959 --> 24:04.026
Hold on to your butts.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.694
Fire in the hole.

24:05.729 --> 24:06.963
Back up. Back up.

24:26.284 --> 24:29.353
Aliens had to hear that.

24:29.387 --> 24:31.021
So, where are they?

24:31.055 --> 24:33.089
Oh, you can bet
they'll be along directly.

24:41.198 --> 24:43.099
Which way, Ben?

24:43.133 --> 24:44.266
I'm not sure.

24:46.002 --> 24:48.137
Anthony, Maggie,
get the C-4.

24:48.171 --> 24:49.905
Yes, sir.
All right.

24:49.939 --> 24:51.239
Tom.

24:51.274 --> 24:55.911
You take Ben, Hal, Maggie,
Anne, Dai to the left.

24:55.945 --> 24:57.479
The rest of you are
coming with me to the right.

24:57.513 --> 24:59.247
We're gonna start
laying out those charges.

24:59.281 --> 25:01.115
We're gonna meet
back at the cave entrance.

25:01.149 --> 25:03.384
We're gonna blow this whole thing
and the Overlord to high hell.

25:21.303 --> 25:23.471
Okay, let's do it --
pronto.

25:25.841 --> 25:27.442
Go, go, go.

25:27.476 --> 25:29.277
Divvy it up.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.488
It's pointing
up at the sky.

25:39.522 --> 25:41.056
I know.

25:41.091 --> 25:43.793
Why? They already wiped out
the Air Force.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.163
It wasn't meant
for humans.

25:51.268 --> 25:52.268
Skitters!

26:19.865 --> 26:21.833
Professor Mason?

26:26.105 --> 26:28.807
What an unpleasant surprise.

26:38.491 --> 26:40.559
Anne,
are you all right?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.962
Yeah. I'm okay.

26:43.996 --> 26:45.496
I think it's safe to say

26:45.531 --> 26:47.298
Dr. Glass will never
be okay again, Tom.

26:47.332 --> 26:49.567
Don't listen to her, Dad!
She's just trying to -- mm!

26:49.601 --> 26:51.068
That'll be enough, Ben!

26:54.539 --> 26:57.541
My master has tried to be
so patient with you, Tom.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.776
But he finds you
a constant nuisance.

26:59.810 --> 27:02.311
I'm glad
to be of service.

27:02.346 --> 27:04.947
Must have scared the hell
out of him, though.

27:04.982 --> 27:07.316
What, was he afraid
to show his ugly face?

27:07.351 --> 27:08.585
On the contrary.

27:08.619 --> 27:10.520
He's right here.

27:13.524 --> 27:14.924
He's quite curious

27:14.959 --> 27:17.560
how you found this facility
and knew we would be here.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.596
I bet he is.

27:19.630 --> 27:21.531
You'll tell us --

27:21.566 --> 27:23.033
everything.

27:24.503 --> 27:26.871
You might as well just
get it over with and kill me,

27:26.905 --> 27:28.640
'cause I'm not gonna tell you
a damn thing.

27:28.674 --> 27:30.375
You're going to die,
Tom.

27:31.511 --> 27:32.644
As will all of you.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.122
I'm afraid
my master will insist on it.

27:44.725 --> 27:47.593
But first,
I'm sure you remember this...

27:51.532 --> 27:54.701
...and the pain
it can inflict.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.075
Karen! Stop it!

28:04.478 --> 28:05.478
Aah!

28:13.419 --> 28:15.920
I've been wanting to do this
for quite some time now.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.061
Get away from him!

28:25.430 --> 28:26.831
Hal!

28:31.904 --> 28:34.506
Tell us
everything you know.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.508
Go to hell.

28:42.181 --> 28:44.583
We'll save Dr. Glass for last,
I think.

28:45.885 --> 28:47.619
For old times' sake.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.864
That the best you got?

29:09.074 --> 29:11.576
Is he enjoying
watching you torture us?

29:11.610 --> 29:14.212
He doesn't care any more
about you than you would care

29:14.246 --> 29:16.914
about a mosquito
buzzing around your face, Tom.

29:16.949 --> 29:19.984
You're just an irritant
to him.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.554
I was hoping
to avoid this.

29:25.758 --> 29:26.792
No!
Don't touch me!

29:46.879 --> 29:48.980
She's pregnant, Tom.

29:51.150 --> 29:53.919
She's pregnant
with your child.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.028
Oh.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.663
You didn't know.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.708
All right! I'll tell you
whatever you want to know!

30:15.742 --> 30:17.543
Just, please, don't.

30:24.152 --> 30:25.919
Hal?!

30:25.953 --> 30:27.587
Hal,
you're gonna be fine!

31:09.297 --> 31:11.298
It's not over, Tom!

31:11.333 --> 31:13.234
You'll never win!

31:13.268 --> 31:14.735
Never!

31:28.649 --> 31:29.882
W-we'll go get help.

31:47.268 --> 31:49.703
I understand.

32:25.374 --> 32:27.142
We have to go.

32:27.176 --> 32:29.210
Anthony, Pope,
get those charges ready.

32:29.245 --> 32:30.978
Everybody else,
move to the cave.

32:31.013 --> 32:32.847
We're gonna
blow this pop stand.

32:32.881 --> 32:34.983
Tector, give me a hand
with Dai's body.

32:35.017 --> 32:36.251
Yes, sir.

32:36.285 --> 32:38.253
Help me with Hal.
He's hurt bad.

33:20.930 --> 33:23.031
Mission accomplished, sir.

33:26.168 --> 33:28.970
All right,
get these people some food!

33:29.004 --> 33:31.906
In fact, get them
any damn thing they want!

33:41.550 --> 33:43.117
Well done, Dan.

33:43.152 --> 33:45.520
I can't tell you how proud I am
of the 2nd Mass.

33:49.525 --> 33:51.860
Wasn't pretty,
but we got it done.

33:51.894 --> 33:53.128
Although, we lost Dai.

33:55.264 --> 33:57.132
He was a good man.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.819
Dad! Ben!

34:21.255 --> 34:22.223
Was it cool?

34:22.257 --> 34:24.324
That's one word for it.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.860
So, are you staying?
With us, I mean?

34:28.897 --> 34:30.931
Matt, Ben's got
important work to do.

34:30.966 --> 34:33.100
Of course I'm staying.

34:33.135 --> 34:35.303
In fact, I was thinking we should
get a killer game of Monopoly going,

34:35.337 --> 34:36.905
if you think
you can beat me.

34:36.938 --> 34:39.139
You know I can,
sucker-fish.

34:47.382 --> 34:49.350
I'm not exactly sure
what's wrong.

34:49.385 --> 34:51.319
He might have
a slight concussion,

34:51.353 --> 34:54.289
but his vital signs are normal,
and he's breathing on his own.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.889
Meaning what?

34:55.925 --> 34:57.258
Meaning nothing, really.

34:57.293 --> 34:59.961
We just  have to wait
and see what happens.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.296
Right now,
I think it's best

35:01.330 --> 35:03.565
if we just let him rest,
okay?

35:05.868 --> 35:08.536
I promise
I'll keep an eye on him.

35:23.119 --> 35:24.853
So...

35:24.887 --> 35:27.255
So...?

35:27.290 --> 35:29.224
You're pregnant.

35:30.894 --> 35:33.529
I was gonna tell you,
but...

35:33.563 --> 35:37.066
Um...
How do <i>you</i> feel about it?

35:37.101 --> 35:39.435
I'm not sure.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.371
You?

35:42.606 --> 35:45.475
When I think about it,
I'm...happy.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.216
What?

35:53.251 --> 35:55.618
I don't know.
I just...

35:55.653 --> 35:57.153
I wonder how fair it is

35:57.188 --> 35:59.689
to bring a child
into this kind of world.

36:01.659 --> 36:05.294
If there's any future
for us...

36:05.329 --> 36:07.897
for <i>any</i> of us...

36:07.931 --> 36:09.198
How can we not?

36:58.683 --> 37:00.651
Aah.

37:47.097 --> 37:50.266
Ah.
The conquering hero.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.667
Or prodigal son?

37:51.702 --> 37:53.369
Never.

37:53.403 --> 37:56.739
It's good to have you back,
safe, in one piece.

37:56.773 --> 37:59.008
I'm so sorry
to hear about your son.

37:59.042 --> 38:00.376
Yes.

38:00.410 --> 38:01.644
We can only hope.

38:01.678 --> 38:03.279
Of course. Of course.

38:03.313 --> 38:05.014
Well,
you have my prayers --

38:05.048 --> 38:07.149
and every resource
of this facility.

38:07.184 --> 38:09.085
Much appreciated.

38:09.119 --> 38:11.087
Would you like a drink?

38:11.121 --> 38:12.389
No, thank you.

38:14.258 --> 38:16.025
Sure?

38:16.060 --> 38:17.660
Scotch -- neat.

38:20.364 --> 38:22.766
I hear that Bressler's agreed
to restore civil rule.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.569
Yes, well, there's a caveat
to his agreement.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.404
It's on condition

38:27.438 --> 38:31.475
that <i>I</i> no longer hold
the office of majority leader.

38:31.509 --> 38:32.643
I see.

38:32.677 --> 38:34.344
Truth be told,
I'm happy to comply.

38:34.379 --> 38:38.249
It's a job better-suited
to a younger man,

38:38.283 --> 38:40.618
someone such as yourself.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.589
Arthur, I can't.

38:46.459 --> 38:49.595
I'm flattered, but no.

38:49.629 --> 38:52.665
I'll stay around for as long
as it takes Hal to recover,

38:52.699 --> 38:55.768
but Captain Weaver and I
have already agreed --

38:55.802 --> 38:58.104
Charleston's not the place
for the 2nd Mass.

38:58.139 --> 39:00.106
That's not the answer
I was hoping for.

39:00.141 --> 39:01.475
I know, and I'm sorry.

39:01.509 --> 39:03.110
But when those bastards
are gone, Arthur,

39:03.144 --> 39:06.279
I promise I will be the first
to get out my old hammer

39:06.313 --> 39:07.814
and start beating my sword

39:07.848 --> 39:10.617
into the best damn plowshare
you ever saw.

39:11.852 --> 39:15.355
But until that day...

39:15.389 --> 39:17.123
I'll fight.

39:18.792 --> 39:22.461
Not because I <i>want</i> to,
but because I <i>have</i> to.

39:30.737 --> 39:32.804
How'd he take it?

39:32.838 --> 39:35.139
Not well.

39:35.174 --> 39:36.707
So?

39:36.742 --> 39:38.843
So I think the sooner
we get out of here, the better.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.278
Yeah.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.519
We've come a long way,
you and I.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.787
Yes, we have.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.759
And I don't exactly know
what's out there --

39:54.793 --> 39:58.129
for me,
for the 2nd Mass.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.398
No, me neither.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.500
But whatever it is,

40:02.534 --> 40:05.703
I'd just as soon
we did it together, like a team.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.371
You know?

40:07.406 --> 40:09.407
I do. A--

40:16.181 --> 40:17.681
Earthquake?!

40:17.716 --> 40:19.850
No!
Not an earthquake!

41:13.304 --> 41:15.238
What the hell
are those?

41:15.272 --> 41:17.774
Nothing
we've ever seen before.
