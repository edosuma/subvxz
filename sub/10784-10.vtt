WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:03.333
PREVIOUSLY ON DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.333 --> 00:04.333
UGH!

00:04.333 --> 00:05.291
WHAT? WHAT?

00:05.291 --> 00:06.291
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KISS HIM.

00:06.291 --> 00:08.583
I CANNOT AND WILL NOT
KISS THAT CRETIN.

00:08.583 --> 00:09.834
I'VE GOT TO TRY LIFE
ON MY OWN.

00:09.834 --> 00:10.834
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.959
NO. IT'S OVER.

00:12.959 --> 00:15.834
WE'VE NEVER TRIED SWINGING
OR SPOUSE SWAPPING.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.250
WOULDN'T THAT BE
MORE APPEALING TO YOUR
RECREATIONAL TASTES?

00:18.250 --> 00:19.708
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
STOP PUNISHING ME?

00:19.708 --> 00:21.834
WHEN IT STOPS HURTING.

00:21.834 --> 00:25.333
TRUST ME.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.917
JOEY IS ONE THING.
JEN IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

00:27.917 --> 00:29.125
HA! YEAH.

00:29.125 --> 00:30.917
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
DAWSON.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.417
DO YOU REALIZE IT'S BEEN
NEARLY 2 WEEKS SINCE
JEN AND I BROKE UP,

00:34.417 --> 00:37.208
AND NOT ONCE HAS SHE
MADE AN EFFORT
TO GET TOGETHER?

00:37.208 --> 00:38.917
I MEAN, SPEND SOME TIME,
GO TO THE MOVIES.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.250
YOU THINK IT'S ODD?

00:40.250 --> 00:42.792
'CAUSE IT SEEMS
A LITTLE ODD TO ME.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.000
DAWSON, YOU ARE AWARE
THAT SHE BROKE UP
WITH YOU, RIGHT?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.875
OF COURSE I AM.
IT'S JUST...

00:47.875 --> 00:50.125
THERE'S A CERTAIN WAY
TO HANDLE THESE THINGS,

00:50.125 --> 00:52.875
AND I THOUGHT JEN
WOULD HOLD HERSELF
TO THAT STANDARD.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.750
LOOK, DAWSON, YOU DON'T
SOUND LIKE A GUY

00:54.750 --> 00:56.375
WHO'S DISAPPOINTED
IN JEN'S BREAKUP ETIQUETTE.

00:56.375 --> 01:00.083
YOU SOUND LIKE A GUY
WHO CAN'T FACE THE REALITY
THAT IT'S OVER.

01:03.917 --> 01:07.291
YOU KNOW,
NOT TO SOUND HARSH,

01:07.291 --> 01:08.875
YOU CAN'T LIVE
IN THE PAST.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.875
YOU HAVE
TO START PREPARING
FOR LIFE AFTER JEN.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.917
SOMETHING TELLS ME
JOEY HAS A THEORY.

01:14.917 --> 01:16.291
OK.

01:16.291 --> 01:19.333
THERE ARE 3 MAIN AREAS
TO FOCUS ON--

01:19.333 --> 01:21.208
FIRST: PUBLIC PERCEPTION.

01:21.208 --> 01:22.375
SUCH AS?

01:22.375 --> 01:24.291
WELL, FROM NOW
UNTIL THE END
OF THE SEMESTER,

01:24.291 --> 01:26.500
YOU'LL BE KNOWN AS
THE GUY JEN DROPPED.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.291
MOST GIRLS WILL VIEW YOU
AS TAINTED GOODS,

01:28.291 --> 01:29.917
AND, OF COURSE,
THERE'LL BE THE FEW

01:29.917 --> 01:31.917
WHO WILL FEEL
INCREDIBLY SORRY FOR YOU

01:31.917 --> 01:33.750
AND OFFER THIS
CERTAIN KIND OF SYMPATHY.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.917
MY ADVICE: AVOID THEM.

01:35.917 --> 01:38.417
THAT'S EASY ENOUGH.
WHAT'S NEXT?

01:38.417 --> 01:39.917
OTHER GUYS.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.125
OTHER GUYS?

01:41.125 --> 01:42.208
LOOK, DAWSON,

01:42.208 --> 01:43.959
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR THE POSSIBILITY

01:43.959 --> 01:45.917
THAT JEN WILL BEGIN
DATING AGAIN.

01:45.917 --> 01:48.333
SEEING HER AROUND SCHOOL
WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND,

01:48.333 --> 01:50.291
WATCHING HER
FROM THIS VERY WINDOW

01:50.291 --> 01:52.500
AS SHE PAUSES COYLY
BY YOUR GARDEN GATE

01:52.500 --> 01:55.458
AND ACCEPTS
A GOOD-NIGHT KISS
FROM A GUY YOU FEEL

01:55.458 --> 01:58.583
PHYSICALLY
AND INTELLECTUALLY
SUPERIOR TO IN EVERY WAY,

01:58.583 --> 01:59.583
AND YOU CAN'T
POSSIBLY--

01:59.583 --> 02:01.000
OK, JOEY,
I GET THE POINT.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.542
WHAT'S THE THIRD THING?

02:03.542 --> 02:04.917
YOU AND JEN.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.583
ME AND JEN?
YEAH.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.959
THE INEVITABLE
CONVERSATION,

02:08.959 --> 02:11.417
WHICH, FRANKLY,
I'M SURPRISED YOU
HAVEN'T HAD YET.

02:11.417 --> 02:13.917
YOU KNOW, SHE'LL ASK YOU

02:13.917 --> 02:16.250
IF YOU THINK THE TWO OF YOU
CAN BE FRIENDS AGAIN

02:16.250 --> 02:18.458
BECAUSE SHE'D
REALLY LIKE THAT,
IF YOU COULD,

02:18.458 --> 02:19.250
AND YOU SAY...

02:21.333 --> 02:23.875
COME ON, DAWSON.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.667
YOU SAY...

02:28.792 --> 02:30.917
I DON'T KNOW! I...

02:30.917 --> 02:34.458
I WANT TO BE HER FRIEND,
BUT THEN AGAIN, I DON'T.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.625
I MEAN, HOW...

02:35.625 --> 02:37.792
HOW CAN YOU ASSUME
TO BE FRIENDS
WITH SOMEONE

02:37.792 --> 02:39.041
WHEN EVERY TIME
YOU LOOK AT THEM,

02:39.041 --> 02:43.583
ALL YOU THINK ABOUT
IS HOW MUCH MORE
YOU REALLY WANT?

02:43.583 --> 02:45.208
WELL, YOU KNOW,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.000
I'M NO EXPERT
AT THIS, DAWSON,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.458
BUT, UH...

02:48.458 --> 02:51.166
I THINK
IT CAN BE DONE.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.417
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

03:48.667 --> 03:49.792
HELLO.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.291
YEAH, HOLD ON.
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.417
GALE.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.959
HELLO. THIS IS GALE.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.333
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS PROBABLY--

04:01.333 --> 04:03.208
YES. WHY DON'T WE
TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE OFFICE?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.708
YES.

04:04.708 --> 04:05.959
OK.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.375
GOOD-BYE.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.750
WAS THAT CALVIN?

04:10.750 --> 04:11.875
I WISH I'D KNOWN.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.583
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
IN A LONG TIME.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.125
NO, IT WASN'T CALVIN.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.916
NO? HIS VOICE
SOUNDED FAMILIAR.

04:16.916 --> 04:20.208
WHO WAS IT?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.083
IT WAS WORK-RELATED.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.834
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU
THINK IT WAS.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.125
HE HAS THE NERVE
TO CALL HERE?

04:32.125 --> 04:33.708
HE HAD A SIMPLE QUESTION.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.417
OH, WELL...

04:35.417 --> 04:38.333
YOU TELL BOB
THAT THE NEXT TIME
HE CALLS HERE,

04:38.333 --> 04:41.708
THE NEXT TIME HE
INTERRUPTS MY BREAKFAST
TO CALL MY WIFE,

04:41.708 --> 04:44.166
THAT THE ONLY
SIMPLE QUESTION
HE'LL NEED AN ANSWER FOR

04:44.166 --> 04:45.208
IS "DO YOU HAVE
HEALTH INSURANCE?"

04:45.208 --> 04:46.291
HE DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

04:46.291 --> 04:49.250
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ANGRY WITH HIM.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.417
YES. WONDERFUL.
NO GREATER WAY
TO START THE DAY

04:52.417 --> 04:54.166
THAN HEARING MY WIFE
DEFEND THE INNOCENT
MOTIVATIONS

04:54.166 --> 04:55.500
OF HER FORMER LOVER.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.834
YOU KNOW WHAT, GALE?
YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M ANGRY.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.333
IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO BE AT BOB.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.375
HONEY...MITCH...

05:00.375 --> 05:01.500
MITCHELL--

05:14.750 --> 05:15.750
DAWSON.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.291
HI, JEN.

05:16.291 --> 05:16.959
HI. HOW YOU DOING?

05:16.959 --> 05:19.291
GREAT, GREAT. YOU?

05:19.291 --> 05:20.750
GREAT, GREAT. UH...

05:20.750 --> 05:22.375
DAWSON?

05:22.375 --> 05:23.875
UH...

05:23.875 --> 05:26.834
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
SOMETIMES AFTER A BREAKUP,

05:26.834 --> 05:28.959
WELL, THERE'S THAT
AWKWARD PERIOD WHERE,

05:28.959 --> 05:30.041
YOU KNOW, WHERE 2 PEOPLE

05:30.041 --> 05:31.875
WHO USED TO HAVE SO MUCH
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER

05:31.875 --> 05:33.792
SUDDENLY FIND
THEIR CONVERSATIONS

05:33.792 --> 05:36.333
REDUCED TO THE MEREST
OF SMALL TALK.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.583
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

05:37.583 --> 05:40.500
I'M SAYING...
WHAT SOMEBODY ALWAYS SAYS

05:40.500 --> 05:43.834
AND WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE
NEVER WANTS TO HEAR, BUT...

05:43.834 --> 05:46.875
BUT DO YOU
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
IN ANY CONCEIVABLE WAY

05:46.875 --> 05:50.041
THAT WE COULD STILL
BE FRIENDS, DAWSON?

05:51.834 --> 05:53.000
Pacey: SO SHE ASKED YOU
IF YOU COULD BE HER FRIEND.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.917
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

05:54.917 --> 05:56.333
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
REALLY.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.834
I LOOKED
STRAIGHT AT HER,

05:57.834 --> 06:01.500
THEN I TOLD HER
I NEEDED TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.291
THAT'S OK. WE STILL GOT
SOME WORK TO DO HERE,

06:04.291 --> 06:05.959
BUT I THINK
WE CAN SALVAGE THIS.

06:05.959 --> 06:07.458
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:07.458 --> 06:09.834
WELL, JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME,

06:09.834 --> 06:12.041
YOU HAVE NO INTEREST
IN SIMPLY BEING
JEN'S FRIEND.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.041
I MEAN, YOU'RE
STILL CARRYING AROUND
THIS HUGE TORCH FOR HER

06:14.041 --> 06:18.250
THAT HAS NO HOPE
OF EXTINGUISHING ITSELF
ANYTIME TOO SOON, CORRECT?

06:18.250 --> 06:19.875
YEAH.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.375
THE LAST PERSON
WHO NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT
THIS ETERNAL FLAME IS JEN.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.542
WHAT SERVES
YOUR PURPOSE HERE
IS TO LET HER KNOW

06:23.542 --> 06:25.375
THAT YOU'RE
COMPLETELY OVER HER.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.375
IT'S YESTERDAY'S NEWS.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.375
THAT'S THE QUICKEST WAY

06:27.375 --> 06:28.375
TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL
OF GETTING JEN BACK.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.041
BUT HOW DO I DO THAT?

06:29.041 --> 06:31.458
Girl: HEY, DAWS.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.917
HEY, MARY BETH.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.208
SO YOU HEAR? WE'RE GETTING
OUR MIDTERMS BACK TODAY.

06:34.208 --> 06:35.208
YEAH? HUH.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.625
CAN'T WAIT.

06:38.834 --> 06:42.000
NOW, OK, UPGRADING JEN
TO GIRLFRIEND STATUS

06:42.000 --> 06:43.375
IS REALLY
A 2-PRONGED ATTACK,

06:43.375 --> 06:44.542
BUT THE FIRST THING
YOU GOTTA DO

06:44.542 --> 06:46.542
IS LET HER KNOW THAT
YOU'RE COMPLETELY COOL

06:46.542 --> 06:48.792
WITH THE IDEA
OF BEING HER FRIEND, OK?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.917
THE QUICKER YOU CAN FEIGN
SOME SORT OF INDIFFERENCE,

06:50.917 --> 06:51.750
THE LESS SPECIAL
SHE'S GONNA FEEL,

06:51.750 --> 06:53.583
AND THE LESS SPECIAL
SHE FEELS,

06:53.583 --> 06:55.500
THE MORE SHE'S GONNA CRAVE
THAT VERY SPECIAL FEELING

06:55.500 --> 06:57.417
THAT COMES FROM BEING
DAWSON LEERY'S GIRLFRIEND.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.458
OK? IT'S A FEELING
THAT'S NOT INCLUDED
IN THE FRIEND PACKAGE.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.792
I CAN DO THAT.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.583
SO WHAT'S
THE SECOND THING?

07:04.583 --> 07:05.542
SLOW DOWN, MY FRIEND.

07:05.542 --> 07:08.041
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.917
OK, THE RUMOR IS TRUE.

07:09.917 --> 07:12.959
YOU WILL BE GETTING YOUR
MIDTERM EXAMS BACK TODAY.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.917
GOOD NEWS IS
MOST OF YOU DID QUITE WELL.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.542
BUT BEFORE
I HAND THEM BACK,

07:16.542 --> 07:18.625
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE
AFTER CLASS.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.458
THOSE PEOPLE ARE...

07:20.458 --> 07:21.625
PACEY WITTER...

07:22.875 --> 07:24.083
WELL...

07:24.083 --> 07:25.625
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.667
[SIGHS]

07:35.750 --> 07:39.708
LOOK, PACEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE A BRIGHT KID.

07:39.708 --> 07:41.417
YOU KNOW WHAT I DID
FIRST THING

07:41.417 --> 07:43.500
AFTER I FINISHED
GRADING YOUR EXAM?

07:43.500 --> 07:44.834
STOPPED LAUGHING?

07:44.834 --> 07:45.959
I WENT
TO THE GUIDANCE OFFICE

07:45.959 --> 07:48.000
AND LOOKED AT
YOUR STANDARDIZED
TEST SCORES.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.375
YOU HAVE AN APTITUDE
FOR THIS STUFF, PACEY.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.625
SO WHEN A STUDENT
WHO'S REALLY BRIGHT

07:52.625 --> 07:54.083
MAKES A 32 ON A MIDTERM,

07:54.083 --> 07:55.542
YOU KNOW WHOSE FAULT
THAT IS?

07:55.542 --> 07:56.542
YOURS?

07:56.542 --> 07:58.959
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S ENTIRELY YOURS.

07:58.959 --> 08:02.000
LOOK, MAYBE
MARINE BIOLOGY'S
NOT YOUR THING.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.166
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
I'M NOT OFFENDED,

08:04.166 --> 08:06.792
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
AN OFFER THAT I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND YOU ACCEPT.

08:06.792 --> 08:10.458
I WANT YOU TO COMPLETE
AN EXTRA-CREDIT PROJECT
FOR ME.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.959
SHOW ME THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
THAT WE'RE LEARNING HERE,

08:12.959 --> 08:16.041
AND I'LL PASS YOU BY
THE SKIN OF YOUR TEETH.

08:16.041 --> 08:18.291
YEAH, SURE.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

08:18.291 --> 08:19.583
WELL, FIRST, YOU HAVE
TO WAIT FOR A STUDENT

08:19.583 --> 08:22.333
FROM MY SIXTH PERIOD
CLASS TO ARRIVE.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.834
GREAT. ANOTHER
ROCKET SCIENTIST,
I PRESUME.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.291
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO ASSIGN A PROJECT

08:26.291 --> 08:30.000
THAT THE TWO OF YOU WILL
WORK ON AFTER SCHOOL
AND ON FREE PERIODS.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.917
HI, DR. RAND.

08:30.917 --> 08:34.166
OH. UM...
I CAN COME BACK.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.667
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, JOEY.

08:35.667 --> 08:39.500
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
YOUR NEW LAB PARTNER.

08:40.166 --> 08:41.207
HIM?

08:41.207 --> 08:43.041
HER?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.542
DR. RAND, I'D LIKE
TO LODGE A FORMAL PROTEST.

08:46.542 --> 08:48.291
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
I WAS GONNA WORKING WITH
A REPRESSED CONTROL FREAK.

08:48.291 --> 08:52.166
YEAH, AND YOU NEVER SAID
MY GRADE WAS DEPENDENT UPON
SOME REMEDIAL UNDERACHIEVER.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.166
WELL, WONDERFUL.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.458
I SEE NO INTRODUCTIONS
ARE NECESSARY.

08:57.959 --> 09:00.041
[SIGHS]

09:00.041 --> 09:01.583
JEN, HI.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.458
HI.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.708
UM, I'M A LITTLE
EMBARRASSED.

09:03.708 --> 09:06.625
YOU ASKED ME
A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION
EARLIER,

09:06.625 --> 09:09.125
AND I REALLY
SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER.

09:09.125 --> 09:11.625
JEN, I WOULD LOVE
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

09:11.625 --> 09:12.208
REALLY?

09:12.208 --> 09:14.125
ABSOLUTELY.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.542
AND TO EASE ANY
OF YOUR REMAINING DOUBTS,

09:16.542 --> 09:18.625
I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.542
OK.

09:19.542 --> 09:20.625
OK.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.834
SO...LET'S HAVE
A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION.

09:23.834 --> 09:24.583
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

09:24.583 --> 09:27.542
NOT TOO BAD.
AND YOURSELF?

09:27.542 --> 09:29.083
EXCELLENT, THANK YOU.

09:29.083 --> 09:32.333
ANY EXCITING PLANS
FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND?

09:32.333 --> 09:34.125
LOOK, DAWSON, YOUR...

09:34.125 --> 09:35.708
YOUR FRIENDSHIP
MEANS A LOT TO ME,

09:35.708 --> 09:38.625
BUT MAYBE THIS ISN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.583
COME ON.
WE'RE FRIENDS NOW, OK?

09:40.583 --> 09:43.667
WHATEVER IT IS,
I THINK I CAN TAKE IT.

09:43.667 --> 09:47.583
OK. OK, WELL,
THEN IN THE NAME
OF FRIENDSHIP,

09:47.583 --> 09:50.125
HOWEVER MISGUIDED, I...

09:50.125 --> 09:53.750
I HAVE A DATE WITH CLIFF
THIS WEEKEND.

09:53.750 --> 09:57.250
WE'RE GOING
TO THE CARNIVAL
ON SATURDAY.

09:58.291 --> 10:01.083
IS THAT WHAT YOU
DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME?

10:01.083 --> 10:04.000
I MEAN,
'CAUSE QUITE FRANKLY,
I'M RELIEVED.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.166
YOU'RE RELIEVED?

10:05.166 --> 10:06.583
THE TRUTH IS,
I ALSO HAVE A DATE
THIS WEEKEND,

10:06.583 --> 10:08.417
AND WE'RE GOING
TO THE CARNIVAL.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.125
ISN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE?

10:10.125 --> 10:11.417
YEAH, IT IS. UH...

10:12.500 --> 10:14.542
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT US
TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE,

10:14.542 --> 10:16.166
WE CAN EASILY
CHANGE OUR PLANS.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.291
CHANGE YOUR PLANS?

10:17.291 --> 10:19.250
JEN, WE SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY
FROM THESE THINGS.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.583
WE SHOULD LOOK AT THEM
AS OPPORTUNITIES.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.583
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR WHAT?

10:23.583 --> 10:26.542
FOR, UM...
A DOUBLE DATE.

10:27.291 --> 10:29.750
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:29.750 --> 10:31.208
OF COURSE I'M SERIOUS.

10:31.208 --> 10:32.333
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THE FOUR OF US.

10:32.333 --> 10:36.083
WELL, I'D SAY IT'S
A LITTLE UNEXPECTED.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.208
UM...

10:37.208 --> 10:39.417
BUT HEY, IF YOU'RE
OK WITH IT.

10:39.417 --> 10:40.166
COMPLETELY. YEAH.

10:40.166 --> 10:42.708
OK.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.208
GREAT.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.250
ALL RIGHT.
GREAT.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.708
SO I WILL SEE YOU
SATURDAY.

10:46.708 --> 10:47.959
YEAH.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.667
Pacey: IT'S NOT REALLY
ALL THAT BAD, DAWSON.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.083
REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU
GETTING JEN BACK WAS
A 2-PART PROCESS?

11:13.083 --> 11:14.208
YEAH.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.166
WELL, THIS IS
THE SECOND PART.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.208
WHAT, HUMILIATING MYSELF
AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK?

11:18.208 --> 11:20.125
NO, MAN.
DATING OTHER WOMEN.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.291
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO LET JEN SEE YOU
IN ACTION

11:22.291 --> 11:24.708
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.583
NOW, I'LL ADMIT THAT GOING
ON A DOUBLE-DATE WITH THE EX

11:27.583 --> 11:29.000
IS KIND OF
AN ADVANCE MANEUVER,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.333
BUT HIGH RISK,
HIGH REWARD.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.250
THIS COULD BE
EXACTLY THE THING
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:32.250 --> 11:32.834
EXCEPT FOR
ONE THING.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.542
WHAT'S THAT?

11:33.542 --> 11:35.750
MY COMPANION
FOR SATURDAY

11:35.750 --> 11:36.708
IS AT THIS POINT
FICTION.

11:36.708 --> 11:37.834
BUT THAT'S NOT
REALLY A PROBLEM.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.458
I ADMIT, IT'S KIND
OF SHORT NOTICE,

11:40.458 --> 11:41.708
BUT THERE'S A LOT
OF YOUNG LADIES

11:41.708 --> 11:43.083
WHO WOULD GIVE UP
THEIR VERY UNEVENTFUL PLANS

11:43.083 --> 11:44.291
FOR A DATE WITH
DAWSON LEERY. HUH?

11:44.291 --> 11:46.500
YEAH.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.834
IN FACT, I THINK I HAVE
THE PERFECT CANDIDATE
RIGHT THERE.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.792
MARY BETH.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.250
OH, HI, DAWSON.
YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.708
OH, NO, NO.
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.250
LOOK, I WAS,
I WAS...

11:59.250 --> 12:00.667
MAYBE THIS IS
SHORT NOTICE,

12:00.667 --> 12:02.208
AND IF IT IS,
I APOLOGIZE,

12:02.208 --> 12:04.291
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED
TO SORT OF...

12:04.291 --> 12:05.792
GO OUT WITH ME
ON SATURDAY.

12:05.792 --> 12:06.333
SATURDAY?

12:06.333 --> 12:09.250
LIKE ON A DATE?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.041
YEAH, OF COURSE.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.208
IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

12:14.208 --> 12:15.708
NO.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.750
YEAH. WELL, YEAH.

12:17.750 --> 12:21.166
IT'S JUST, I, UM,
I KNOW THAT YOU JUST
BROKE UP WITH JEN.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.166
AND WHILE I DON'T KNOW
THE PARTICULARS OF IT ALL,

12:23.166 --> 12:26.834
I DO KNOW THAT
IT'S A COMMON MISTAKE
MADE BY MANY PEOPLE

12:26.834 --> 12:28.375
TO BEGIN TO DATE BEFORE
THEY'RE REALLY READY.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.708
I'M READY.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.708
COMPLETELY READY.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.000
COULD NOT BE
MORE READY.

12:35.708 --> 12:36.708
HONEST?

12:36.708 --> 12:38.542
HONEST.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.417
BOY, THIS IS FASCINATING.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.250
[SIGHS]

12:46.250 --> 12:48.250
I'M SORRY
THERE ARE NO CARTOONS

12:48.250 --> 12:49.333
TO MAKE THIS INTERESTING
FOR YOU, PACEY,

12:49.333 --> 12:50.917
BUT IT'S NOT DESIGNED
TO BE FASCINATING.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.667
IT'S DESIGNED
TO BE EDUCATIONAL.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.834
WELL, THANK YOU,
DR. SCHWEITZER.

12:55.834 --> 12:58.750
NOW REFRESH MY MEMORY
AS TO WHY WE'RE HERE AGAIN.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.417
WE'RE OBSERVING
THE REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS
OF PULMONATA SNAILS,

13:01.417 --> 13:04.875
AND DR. RAND SAID THAT
THEY REPRODUCE MORE
WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY,

13:04.875 --> 13:07.291
SO BY VARYING
THE CONTENTS
OF THE TANK,

13:07.291 --> 13:08.208
WE CAN DETERMINE
WHICH FACTORS

13:08.208 --> 13:10.250
ARE MOST CONDUCIVE
TO REPRODUCTION.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.166
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY THAT?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.291
WE'LL BUY 'EM
A COUPLE DRINKS,
TURN OFF THE LIGHT,

13:14.291 --> 13:16.291
AND JUST COME BACK
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.708
YOU NEVER FAIL
TO DISAPPOINT,
DO YOU, PACEY?

13:18.708 --> 13:20.333
I MEAN, WHY DID
I ACTUALLY THINK

13:20.333 --> 13:21.375
THAT THE VERY REAL
PROSPECTS

13:21.375 --> 13:23.875
OF REPEATING
MARINE BIOLOGY
NEXT SUMMER

13:23.875 --> 13:26.417
MIGHT CAUSE YOU
TO TAKE THIS PROJECT
SERIOUSLY?

13:26.417 --> 13:27.208
PLEASE. SUMMER SCHOOL?

13:27.208 --> 13:28.375
YEAH.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.333
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.291
ONLY MORONS
GO TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.208
YEAH, WELL,
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,

13:32.208 --> 13:34.917
YOU WERE PULLING
A STELLAR F-MINUS,

13:34.917 --> 13:36.792
SO WITHOUT
THIS EXTRA-CREDIT
PROJECT, PACEY,

13:36.792 --> 13:38.291
I'M VERY WELL CERTAIN

13:38.291 --> 13:41.291
THAT YOUR GRADE WILL NOT
ONLY PLACE YOU SQUARELY
AMONG THE MORONS,

13:41.291 --> 13:44.917
BUT YOU MAY VERY WELL
BE THEIR LEADER.

13:49.250 --> 13:50.291
HEY.

13:50.291 --> 13:50.875
HEY.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.458
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.959
I WAS JUST WONDERING

13:53.959 --> 13:56.708
IF ANYONE HAD CALLED
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

13:56.708 --> 13:59.208
NOPE. NOTHING.

14:02.417 --> 14:04.417
UH, WHAT ABOUT YESTERDAY?

14:04.417 --> 14:07.500
UM, ANY CALLS
YESTERDAY?

14:07.500 --> 14:09.792
HEY, COME ON. I ALWAYS
LEAVE YOUR MESSAGES
ON THE LITTLE PAD

14:09.792 --> 14:10.500
RIGHT NEXT TO
THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.417
FORGIVE ME, DAWSON.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.875
MAYBE I'M NOT BEING CLEAR.

14:15.875 --> 14:20.750
I DIDN'T ASK IF ANYONE
HAD CALLED FOR ME
PERSONALLY.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.792
I ASKED IF ANYONE
HAD CALLED...

14:24.792 --> 14:27.834
THAT I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.834
NO.

14:31.834 --> 14:32.959
HE DIDN'T CALL.

14:34.792 --> 14:37.583
AH, WELL, THEN...
VERY GOOD.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.875
THANK YOU, DAWSON.

14:53.834 --> 14:56.250
PACEY, IT WAS
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
LAST NIGHT

14:56.250 --> 14:57.375
TO CHECK ON THESE SNAILS,

14:57.375 --> 14:58.250
AND NOW LOOK AT 'EM.
THEY'RE DEAD.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.041
THEIR SHELLS
ARE COMPLETELY EMPTY.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.208
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.125
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

15:03.125 --> 15:04.959
YESTERDAY, WE HAD
A SCIENCE PROJECT,

15:04.959 --> 15:08.250
AND TODAY, WE HAVE, WHAT,
2/3 OF A CHARM BRACELET?

15:12.041 --> 15:14.708
I'M JUST GONNA
TELL DR. RAND

15:14.708 --> 15:15.834
THAT THIS EXPERIMENT
WITHIN AN EXPERIMENT

15:15.834 --> 15:17.542
JUST ISN'T WORKING OUT.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.667
BEFORE YOU RUN OFF
TO DR. RAND,

15:18.667 --> 15:20.667
THERE IS AN EXPLANATION
FOR THIS. THERE IS.

15:20.667 --> 15:25.000
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW HOW
YOU SAID THIS EXPERIMENT
WAS ALL ABOUT SEEING

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
WHICH ENVIRONMENT WAS
BEST FOR THESE SNAILS,
RIGHT?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.834
SO, I DID COME IN
LAST NIGHT,

15:28.834 --> 15:30.875
AND I WAS
WATCHING THE SNAILS,

15:30.875 --> 15:32.583
AND THERE'S
NOTHING HAPPENING,

15:32.583 --> 15:33.875
SO I ADDED SOME FOOD,

15:33.875 --> 15:36.000
AND THEN I ADDED
SOME WATER,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.959
AND THERE WAS STILL
NOTHING HAPPENING
IN THERE,

15:37.959 --> 15:39.959
SO I THOUGHT
MAYBE THE PROBLEM
WASN'T THE ENVIRONMENT.

15:39.959 --> 15:41.250
MAYBE THESE SNAILS,
THEY JUST DIDN'T
LIKE EACH OTHER.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.875
RIGHT? MAYBE THEY JUST
NEEDED TO LOOSEN UP
A LITTLE.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.458
PACEY, I TOLD YOU
YESTERDAY.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.000
PULMONATA SNAILS
ARE SINGLE-SEX.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.792
THEY DON'T NEED
ANOTHER ORGANISM
TO REPRODUCE.

15:49.792 --> 15:50.875
RIGHT, AND I WOULD'VE
REMEMBERED THAT

15:50.875 --> 15:52.250
IF I ACTUALLY LISTEN
WHEN YOU TALKED TO ME,

15:52.250 --> 15:55.417
BUT I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE SNAILS
ARE JUST LIKE GUYS.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.000
YOU KNOW, THAT THEIR
ULTIMATE FANTASY

15:57.000 --> 15:59.917
IS TO BE WITH
2 FEMALE SNAILS
AT THE SAME TIME.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.792
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
THIS PROJECT NEEDED
TO GET MOVING ALONG.

16:02.792 --> 16:05.458
LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

16:05.458 --> 16:09.125
YOU'VE TRIED TO CREATE
SOME SORT OF A SNAIL
MéNAGE Ä TROIS?

16:09.125 --> 16:12.458
IT SOUNDS STUPID
WHEN YOU SAY IT
OUT LOUD,

16:12.458 --> 16:16.041
BUT I JUST SAW THIS
REALLY PRETTY SNAIL

16:16.041 --> 16:17.417
IN THE TANK
OVER BY THE WINDOW,

16:17.417 --> 16:19.041
AND I DON'T KNOW.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.625
LAST NIGHT,
IT JUST SEEMED
REALLY BRILLIANT.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.542
LET ME FILL YA IN
ON SOMETHING HERE.

16:21.542 --> 16:24.208
YOU KNOW THIS
PRETTY LITTLE SNAIL

16:24.208 --> 16:25.583
OVER HERE BY THE WINDOW?

16:25.583 --> 16:28.750
IT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A CARNIVOROUS SNAIL,

16:28.750 --> 16:31.083
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
CARNIVOROUS SNAILS EAT?

16:31.083 --> 16:32.417
OTHER SNAILS.

16:32.417 --> 16:33.625
YEAH, OTHER SNAILS.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.625
OTHER SNAILS
SUCH AS OUR SNAILS,

16:35.625 --> 16:37.500
SUCH AS THE SNAILS WE'RE
DESPERATELY RELYING ON

16:37.500 --> 16:38.667
TO RAISE OUR
MARINE BIOLOGY GRADES.

16:38.667 --> 16:42.166
OK. I'M SORRY, OK?

16:42.166 --> 16:45.959
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS PROJECT WAS FOR YOU.

16:46.542 --> 16:48.917
OK, TO US. OK.

16:48.917 --> 16:51.750
SO WHATEVER
I NEED TO DO, OK?

16:51.750 --> 16:54.208
HOWEVER I CAN MAKE THIS
UP TO YOU, JOEY.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.500
I'M DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, DAWSON.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.959
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE
JUST USING MARY BETH
TO MAKE JEN JEALOUS.

17:00.959 --> 17:03.542
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT?

17:03.542 --> 17:05.165
I'M A HEEL
OF THE WORST KIND.

17:05.165 --> 17:07.416
THE KIND
THAT PREYS UPON
AN INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL

17:07.416 --> 17:08.834
WITH SOME INEXPLICABLE
CRUSH ON ME

17:08.834 --> 17:11.083
AND CONVINCES HER
TO GO OUT WITH ME FOR
MY OWN PERSONAL GAIN.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.040
WELL, IF YOU KNOW THAT,
THEN DON'T DO IT.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.625
JUST CALL HER UP
AND SAY YOU HAVE
TO STAY IN TO...

17:16.625 --> 17:18.583
WASH YOUR HAIR
OR SOMETHING.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.500
I CAN'T, JOEY.
THAT'S JUST IT.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.333
I KNOW IF I WAS
REALLY THE PERSON
I THOUGHT I WAS,

17:23.333 --> 17:25.290
I WOULD HAVE
ENOUGH CONSIDERATION
FOR MARY BETH'S FEELINGS

17:25.290 --> 17:26.625
AND CANCEL THE DATE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

17:26.625 --> 17:32.500
I JUST...
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
MYSELF LATELY, YOU KNOW?

17:34.375 --> 17:37.375
ANYWAY, PACEY SAYS
I SHOULD LOOK AT THIS
AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.959
WAIT A SECOND. YOU'RE TAKING
ROMANTIC ADVICE FROM A GUY

17:39.959 --> 17:43.041
WHO SPENT HIS EVENING
TRYING TO GET 3 SNAILS
TO SLEEP WITH EACH OTHER?

17:43.917 --> 17:46.417
YEAH, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY...

17:46.417 --> 17:49.041
LOOK, DAWSON, YOUR LITTLE
DEPARTURE INTO JERKDOM

17:49.041 --> 17:52.542
IS UNDERSTANDABLE, PERHAPS,
BUT IT'S NOTHING TO BE
PROUD OF.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.708
JUST PROMISE YOU WON'T
MAKE A HABIT OF IT.

17:54.708 --> 17:57.125
JOE, I WON'T.
I PROMISE.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.208
BECAUSE DESPITE
CURRENT EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY,

18:01.208 --> 18:05.250
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES,
DAWSON.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.375
AND THE OTHER SIDE
IS POPULATED ENOUGH.
TRUST ME.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.333
JOE, ALL THINGS
CONSIDERED,

18:10.333 --> 18:13.375
I REALLY WISH I WAS
TAKING YOU WITH ME
TODAY.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.542
WELL...

18:17.291 --> 18:20.041
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
I...

18:20.041 --> 18:23.417
I KIND OF WISH
YOU WERE, TOO.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.750
COME ON, JOEY.
LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

18:27.750 --> 18:31.291
I SEE MY DEVIANT LAB PARTNER
HAS ARRIVED.

18:31.291 --> 18:35.542
PACEY'S GRACIOUSLY
VOLUNTEERED TO TRANSPORT ME
TO THE TIDAL POOL

18:35.542 --> 18:38.417
SO WE CAN FIND
A PAIR OF SUITABLE
REPLACEMENT SNAILS.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.417
I'LL SEE YA.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.667
DAWSON!

18:55.667 --> 18:58.291
MARY BETH. HI.

18:58.291 --> 18:59.250
HI.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.542
UM, HI.

19:01.542 --> 19:02.542
SO IS IT TOO FORWARD

19:02.542 --> 19:04.291
IF I TELL YOU THAT
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE?

19:04.291 --> 19:07.542
NO, IT'S NOT. THANKS.
SO DO YOU.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.125
OH, NO.
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL
OBLIGATED TO SAY THAT.

19:10.125 --> 19:13.458
I MEAN, UH,
I MEAN, I'M, UH...

19:13.458 --> 19:18.125
LET'S JUST
START OVER AGAIN.
HI. I'M MARY BETH.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.708
DAWSON.

19:19.708 --> 19:23.542
PERFECT! LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE JUST IN TIME
FOR INTRODUCTIONS, HUH?

19:23.542 --> 19:24.959
HI.

19:24.959 --> 19:29.417
YEAH. MARY BETH,
THIS IS JEN LINDLEY
AND CLIFF HER DATE.

19:29.417 --> 19:31.750
HI. MARY BETH,
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.000
UH, SAME HERE,
I THINK.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.917
UM, DAWSON,
A WORD, PLEASE.

19:35.917 --> 19:39.250
UM, WE'LL CATCH UP.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.333
THIS WASN'T
A FREAK COINCIDENCE,
WAS IT?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.208
IN A WORD, NO.

19:44.208 --> 19:48.125
LOOK, MAYBE ON YOUR PLANET
TAKING AN EX-GIRLFRIEND

19:48.125 --> 19:49.458
ON A DOUBLE DATE
IS A GOOD IDEA,

19:49.458 --> 19:50.500
BUT WHERE I COME FROM,
IT'S NOT.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.792
IN FACT, IT'S A DECIDEDLY
LOUSY IDEA,

19:53.792 --> 19:55.667
ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOU FAIL TO INFORM
YOUR EVENING'S COMPANION.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.500
WAIT.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.333
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.667
WELL, BEFORE YOU
TELL ME WHAT I THINK,
LET ME TELL YOU.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.417
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
THAT YOU'RE STILL HUNG UP
ON HER.

20:06.417 --> 20:07.834
NO. MARY BETH--

20:07.834 --> 20:11.208
NO. PLEASE KNOW THAT
I AM NOT OFTEN WRONG
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.375
UNTIL NOW.

20:14.458 --> 20:16.333
HUMOR ME.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.417
OK. HERE'S
THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.959
I'VE OFTEN REGARDED
TROLLING FOR SNAILS

20:31.959 --> 20:33.208
AS ONE OF THE MORE
UNDERRATED WAYS

20:33.208 --> 20:34.041
TO SPEND ONE'S LEISURE TIME.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.542
DESPITE WHAT
YOU MAY THINK,

20:36.542 --> 20:39.041
THIS ISN'T MY FIRST CHOICE
FOR A SATURDAY AFTERNOON,
EITHER.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.375
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I WASN'T THE ONE

20:40.375 --> 20:42.375
WHO TRIED TO TURN
OUR AQUARIUM

20:42.375 --> 20:44.583
INTO PLATO'S RETREAT
NOW, WAS I?

20:45.834 --> 20:49.291
ACTUALLY, JOEY, I'M REALLY
CURIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.708
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THIS GREAT STUDENT,

20:52.708 --> 20:54.375
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
ON THIS MIDTERM, HUH?

20:54.375 --> 20:56.750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.708
WELL, WHAT GRADE
DID YOU GET?

20:58.708 --> 21:00.417
WAS IT A MASSIVE FAILURE
LIKE MINE

21:00.417 --> 21:01.708
OR JUST ONE OF THOSE
NEAR MISSES?

21:01.708 --> 21:03.083
I'M DYING TO KNOW.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.250
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE ALMOST THERE,

21:04.250 --> 21:06.375
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME,

21:06.375 --> 21:08.500
SO LET'S JUST
SAVE THE CHITCHAT
FOR LATER, OK?

21:08.500 --> 21:09.583
[SNICKERS]

21:15.750 --> 21:17.750
SO YOU'RE REALLY
DOING THIS FOR JEN?

21:17.750 --> 21:19.750
EXACTLY.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.583
OH. IT'S ONE OF HER
FIRST DATES WITH CLIFF.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.750
SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T
WANNA BE ALONE WITH HIM.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.458
PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE REALLY LIKES HIM.

21:26.458 --> 21:29.333
SO IN ORDER TO TAKE
THE PRESSURE OFF,

21:29.333 --> 21:31.917
SHE ASKS YOU
TO MAKE IT A DOUBLE.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.708
GOD, DAWSON, THAT IS
REALLY VERY SWEET
OF YOU.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.125
REALLY, DON'T MENTION IT.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.625
NO. I CAN IMAGINE
SOME OF THESE GUYS

21:38.625 --> 21:41.458
EVEN TRYING TO SABOTAGE
THEIR EX-GIRLFRIEND'S
DATE.

21:41.458 --> 21:42.750
REALLY?

21:42.750 --> 21:44.667
[CHUCKLES]
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

21:44.667 --> 21:45.583
YEAH, I KNOW.

21:45.583 --> 21:49.542
SO, ANYWAY,
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

21:49.542 --> 21:50.834
UM...

21:52.250 --> 21:52.792
THANK YOU.

21:52.792 --> 21:55.458
AW...

21:55.458 --> 21:58.250
I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.250
ALL RIGHT, PACEY.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.041
THE WATER'S GETTING
KIND OF HIGH,

22:12.041 --> 22:12.875
SO WE SHOULD
PROBABLY--

22:12.875 --> 22:14.917
PACEY.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.000
WHAT?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.166
PLEASE TELL ME THAT
YOU TIED OUR BOAT UP,

22:18.166 --> 22:20.458
AND THE ONE THAT'S
FLOATING DOWNSTREAM
ISN'T OURS.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I TIED OUR BOAT UP,

22:27.000 --> 22:29.291
AND THE ONE THAT'S
FLOATING DOWNSTREAM
ISN'T OURS.

22:29.291 --> 22:31.125
GREAT.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.667
OOH, TOUGH LUCK, D-MAN.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.083
AND WE'VE GOT A WINNER.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.000
ALL RIGHT,
WHICH ONE?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.792
GO AHEAD, YOU DECIDE.
I TRUST YOU.

22:44.792 --> 22:47.208
GREAT.
UH, WE'LL TAKE...

22:47.208 --> 22:48.708
THAT ONE.

22:48.708 --> 22:49.750
BIG CAT FOR
THE LITTLE LADY.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.959
I THINK THE FERRIS WHEEL
IS WORKING AGAIN,

22:52.959 --> 22:54.375
SO IF ANYBODY WANTS
TO TAKE A RIDE...

22:54.375 --> 22:55.500
ONCE MORE.
YOU AND ME.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.291
WHAT'S THAT?

22:56.291 --> 22:59.041
YOU HEARD ME.
RACK 'EM!

22:59.041 --> 23:01.417
LOOK, DAWSON,
THERE'S NO SHAME
IN LOSING HERE.

23:01.417 --> 23:04.458
I DID COME IN THIRD IN
PITCH, HIT, AND RUN REGIONALS

23:04.458 --> 23:07.708
LAST SUMMER IN BOSTON,
SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA GET--

23:07.708 --> 23:09.959
YOUR TURN.

23:24.208 --> 23:25.834
OOH.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.458
CLASSIC PISSING CONTEST.

23:31.041 --> 23:33.917
AFTER YOU.

23:45.417 --> 23:46.375
OH, DAWS...

23:46.375 --> 23:48.834
NO PRESSURE, MAN,
ALL RIGHT?

23:54.750 --> 23:55.708
YES!

23:55.708 --> 23:57.583
WE GOT A WINNER.

23:57.583 --> 24:01.291
SO, MY FRIEND,
WHO'S THE LUCKY LADY?

24:07.750 --> 24:08.708
UM...

24:08.708 --> 24:10.708
WE NEED TO TALK.

24:13.959 --> 24:15.542
LOOK, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

24:15.542 --> 24:18.333
THE BOAT WILL
WASH ASHORE EVENTUALLY.

24:18.333 --> 24:21.291
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THE BOAT
ISN'T MY FIRST CONCERN.

24:21.291 --> 24:24.291
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT
ONCE YOU DID IN OUR SNAILS

24:24.291 --> 24:26.708
THAT I WOULDN'T
BE FAR BEHIND. OHH.

24:26.708 --> 24:29.375
GOD, I'M FREEZING.

24:29.375 --> 24:32.125
LISTEN, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE COLD WATER,
ALL RIGHT?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.625
YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.792
IT'S A PREDICTION I MAKE
WITH ALL DUE REGRET
AT THIS POINT.

24:35.792 --> 24:38.458
CLEVER. YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF SURVIVAL,

24:38.458 --> 24:40.375
I THOUGHT CREATURES WITH
YOUR LEVEL OF BRAIN POWER

24:40.375 --> 24:42.583
WENT EXTINCT
A FEW YEARS BACK.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.375
IT'S AMAZING.
PERSONALITY LIKES YOURS,

24:44.375 --> 24:45.583
YOU STILL CAN'T
GET ANY DATES.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.708
EVEN MORE AMAZING.

24:46.708 --> 24:49.667
PERSONALITY LIKE YOURS,
AND YOU CAN.

24:56.417 --> 24:59.792
WE'LL GET SOME
DRY CLOTHES

24:59.792 --> 25:01.792
WHEN WE GET OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.625
RIGHT NOW,
JUST CHANGE
INTO THIS.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.542
A BLANKET?

25:07.542 --> 25:08.417
YOU WANT ME
TO CHANGE INTO THAT?

25:08.417 --> 25:09.834
YEAH, TAKE OFF
YOUR WET CLOTHES,

25:09.834 --> 25:12.291
WRAP THIS AROUND YOU,
JUST LIKE I'M GONNA DO.

25:12.291 --> 25:14.250
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU WANT ME
TO GET NAKED?

25:14.250 --> 25:16.125
PLEASE. THIS IS NOT
FOR MY ENJOYMENT.

25:16.125 --> 25:19.041
IT'S SO YOU DON'T GET SICK.
BUT IF YOU GOT YOUR HEART
SET ON PNEUMONIA,

25:19.041 --> 25:20.458
THEN FEEL FREE.

25:20.458 --> 25:21.917
FINE.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.458
NO PEEKING.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.542
OH, YEAH. THE IDEA
OF SEEING YOU
IN YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT

25:28.542 --> 25:30.000
IS REALLY MY IDEA
OF A THRILL.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.625
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WOULD CONSIDER YOU
A VERY LUCKY WOMAN.

25:33.625 --> 25:36.583
MANY PEOPLE
WOULD CONSIDER YOU
A VERY DELUDED MAN.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.917
OK.

25:40.917 --> 25:42.166
ALL SET OVER HERE.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.458
HOW YOU DOIN'?

25:44.458 --> 25:46.250
YOU TAKE ONE MORE STEP
IN THIS DIRECTION,

25:46.250 --> 25:49.041
AND I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE YOU
A PERMANENT DISABILITY.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.792
TELL YOU WHAT.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.834
WHY DON'T I JUST
START THE CAR?

25:52.834 --> 25:54.834
GOOD IDEA.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.583
WHAT?

26:40.583 --> 26:41.792
JUST--NOTHING.

26:41.792 --> 26:45.500
WHAT? WHAT'S THAT
SMILE OF YOURS?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.583
IS IT BECAUSE
I LOOK RIDICULOUS?

26:47.583 --> 26:48.583
NO.

26:48.583 --> 26:50.792
OR IS IT THAT MY MISFORTUNE
AMUSES YOU?

26:50.792 --> 26:52.333
OR MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING
YOU JUST ENJOY--

26:52.333 --> 26:53.834
PUTTING ME IN THE MOST
AWKWARD SITUATIONS

26:53.834 --> 26:54.625
AND JUST WATCHING ME
SQUIRM, PACEY.

26:54.625 --> 26:56.458
NO,
IT'S NONE OF THAT.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.083
I WAS JUST
THINKING TO MYSELF

26:58.083 --> 27:03.083
THAT WHEN YOU LOOSEN UP,
YOU'RE NOT HALF BAD
TO BE AROUND.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.500
BORDERING ON FUN, EVEN.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.375
HOME, JEEVES.

27:15.375 --> 27:19.250
HA HA.
YES, MISS DAISY.

27:31.542 --> 27:32.959
MARY BETH.

27:32.959 --> 27:35.708
OH, GOD.
I'M SO EMBARRASSED.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.750
GOOD OLD MARY BETH.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.458
CREATING SCENES
WHEREVER SHE GOES.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.208
PLEASE. I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.333
I OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION,

27:43.333 --> 27:44.708
AND THIS TIME,
I OWE YOU THE TRUTH.

27:44.708 --> 27:47.375
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE UPSET WITH ME

27:47.375 --> 27:49.625
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU SAID BEFORE,

27:49.625 --> 27:51.667
EVERYTHING THAT
I CONVINCED YOU
WASN'T THE TRUTH,

27:51.667 --> 27:54.125
WELL, IT WAS.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.834
I'M NOT OVER JEN.
NOT NEARLY.

27:55.834 --> 27:59.333
AND I'M ON THIS DATE
NOT TO HELP HER,

27:59.333 --> 28:00.375
BUT TO GET HER BACK.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.583
DAWSON, YOU'RE A NICE GUY.
I LIKE YOU.

28:02.583 --> 28:05.291
DO I LIKE YOU
LIKE YOU?

28:05.291 --> 28:07.250
NO. YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO NEUROTIC FOR THAT.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.834
[CHUCKLES]

28:09.834 --> 28:10.917
OK. HA HA HA.

28:10.917 --> 28:14.208
WELL, THEN, WHY DID YOU
GO OUT WITH ME?

28:14.208 --> 28:15.834
FIRST, I FELT
SORRY FOR YOU.

28:15.834 --> 28:18.041
IT WAS CLEAR YOU WERE
STILL HUNG UP ON JEN,

28:18.041 --> 28:21.500
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
YOU SEEMED HARMLESS ENOUGH,

28:21.500 --> 28:23.250
AND MY SATURDAY WASN'T
EXACTLY ACTION-PACKED.

28:23.250 --> 28:28.417
OK. SO IF IT WASN'T
MY FEELINGS FOR JEN
THAT UPSET YOU,

28:28.417 --> 28:30.250
WHAT WAS IT?

28:32.208 --> 28:32.959
MARY BETH?

28:37.542 --> 28:39.875
DO YOU EVER NOTICE
THE WAY CLIFF'S EYES

28:39.875 --> 28:43.458
SORT OF SMILE
WHEN HE TALKS TO YOU?

28:44.375 --> 28:47.625
OH, GOD. YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON CLIFF?

28:47.625 --> 28:50.917
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
THAT I FULLY PROCESSED

28:50.917 --> 28:53.834
THAT HE HAS ABSOLUTELY
NO INTEREST IN ME.

28:53.834 --> 28:55.542
HE'S TOTALLY
HUNG UP ON JEN.

28:55.542 --> 28:57.208
HE IS.

28:57.208 --> 29:00.500
SHE'S PRETTY HUNG UP
ON HIM, TOO.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.166
SHE IS?

29:04.041 --> 29:06.542
AFRAID SO.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.625
MOVE OVER.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.917
OF COURSE,
THIS DOESN'T MEAN

29:20.917 --> 29:24.208
THAT WE STILL CAN'T
HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

29:38.917 --> 29:39.708
YOU HAVING
A NICE TIME, JEN?

29:39.708 --> 29:43.125
YEAH. YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.583
ALL RIGHT,
YOU READY?

29:45.583 --> 29:46.542
READY.

29:46.542 --> 29:47.708
LET'S DO IT.

29:47.708 --> 29:49.166
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
FINALLY NEXT, HUH?

29:49.166 --> 29:50.917
PERFECT. SO, CLIFF,

29:50.917 --> 29:52.250
WHY DON'T YOU
RIDE WITH ME?

29:52.250 --> 29:54.083
'CAUSE WE'VE HARDLY
CHATTED ALL NIGHT.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.333
UH, BUT...

30:01.250 --> 30:03.708
THANKS FOR
THE CLOTHES, JOE.

30:03.708 --> 30:08.041
OH, DON'T THANK ME.
THANK BODIE. THEY'RE HIS.

30:08.041 --> 30:10.959
YOU KNOW, JOEY,
WE ARE ON DRY LAND,

30:10.959 --> 30:11.792
AND YOU NEVER DID
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

30:11.792 --> 30:15.125
AND WHAT QUESTION
WAS THAT?

30:15.125 --> 30:16.291
YOUR MIDTERM GRADE.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.208
LISTEN, I KNOW YOU'RE
A LITTLE EMBARRASSED,

30:18.208 --> 30:19.625
SO LET ME JUST
REMOVE THE STIGMA.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.583
I GOT SOMEWHERE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF A 32.

30:21.583 --> 30:22.708
PACEY...

30:22.708 --> 30:24.333
COME ON, JOEY.
JUST TOSS IT OUT THERE.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.208
NO.

30:26.208 --> 30:29.417
NO. OK, THEN LET ME
GUESS AT IT.

30:29.417 --> 30:32.291
58, 38, 18.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.667
98.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.708
9-8? WHICH ONE WAS IT,
A 9 OR AN 8?

30:38.708 --> 30:41.375
BOTH OF THEM, OK?

30:43.291 --> 30:47.500
OK. I ASSUME THERE'S
A SUITABLE EXPLANATION

30:47.500 --> 30:48.166
FOR THAT STORY,
RIGHT, JOE?

30:48.166 --> 30:50.583
YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION?

30:50.583 --> 30:52.625
LOOK AROUND YOU, PACEY.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.208
LOOK AT WHAT
MY LIFE IS.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.083
I'M A BORDER
IN MY SISTER'S HOUSE.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.708
I SHARE MY BEDROOM
WITH THE LIVING ROOM,

30:57.708 --> 30:59.625
AND MY SOCIAL LIFE

30:59.625 --> 31:01.166
CONSISTS OF
A PART-TIME JOB.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.875
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THERE ARE ONLY 2 WAYS
TO MAKE MY LIFE BETTER.

31:03.875 --> 31:05.166
THE ONE THAT DOESN'T
INVOLVE WAKING UP

31:05.166 --> 31:06.500
AND DISCOVERING
IT'S ALL BEEN A DREAM

31:06.500 --> 31:08.083
INVOLVES
A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.667
WHEN I APPLY, I BETTER
HAVE THE GRADES THAT
DON'T GIVE THEM A CHOICE

31:10.667 --> 31:11.792
BECAUSE A SCHOLARSHIP
IS PRETTY MUCH

31:11.792 --> 31:13.291
MY ONLY WAY OUT
OF CAPESIDE.

31:13.291 --> 31:17.542
AND IF I DON'T
GET OUT OF HERE,
PACEY, WELL...

31:17.542 --> 31:21.166
I'LL BE A SADDER STORY
THAN I CARE TO IMAGINE.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.542
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY, JOE.

31:23.542 --> 31:25.208
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.291
YOU'RE GONNA GO
TO SOME GREAT SCHOOL

31:27.291 --> 31:29.375
AND SEND ME POSTCARDS
BACK HERE,

31:29.375 --> 31:31.750
WHERE I'LL BE TENDING BAR
OR PUMPING GAS.

31:31.750 --> 31:33.583
COME ON, PACEY,
YOU'LL GET OUT, TOO.

31:33.583 --> 31:36.083
YEAH, IF THE CIRCUS
IS HIRING.

31:36.083 --> 31:39.375
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
THOUGH.

31:39.375 --> 31:43.417
I WOULDN'T BET AGAINST
THAT POTTER GIRL.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.917
SO, YOU HAVING FUN
TONIGHT, OR WHAT?

31:50.917 --> 31:52.000
YES.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.542
IS THAT A YES TO THE FUN
OR YES TO THE WHAT?

31:54.542 --> 31:58.166
THE FUN. OHH.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.583
GREAT.

31:59.583 --> 32:03.208
I'M SURE THEY'LL HAVE IT
FIXED IN A MINUTE.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.333
YEAH.

32:07.542 --> 32:10.625
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I FIND FASCINATING?

32:10.625 --> 32:14.083
IS THAT THE WORD
FLAMMABLE
AND INFLAMMABLE

32:14.083 --> 32:16.417
MEAN THE EXACT
SAME THING.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.250
ISN'T THAT BIZARRE?

32:20.125 --> 32:22.583
SO YOU AND CLIFF
SEEM PRETTY TOGETHER.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.750
I WOULDN'T
EXACTLY SAY THAT.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.041
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

32:28.417 --> 32:30.500
I WOULD SAY
IT'S ONLY A DATE.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.583
UM, I WOULD SAY WE'RE JUST
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

32:33.583 --> 32:35.083
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY

32:35.083 --> 32:39.125
THAT I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.208
DAWSON, I KNOW
I MADE A BIG DEAL

32:43.208 --> 32:45.041
OUT OF REMAINING
FRIENDS WITH YOU,

32:45.041 --> 32:48.166
AND AT THE RISK
OF SOUNDING RUDE,

32:48.166 --> 32:51.041
I THINK I SHOULD
RETRACT MY OFFER.

32:51.041 --> 32:53.875
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

32:53.875 --> 32:56.458
IT MEANS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

32:56.458 --> 33:00.083
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WANTED TO COME
OR WHY I LET YOU,

33:00.083 --> 33:02.792
BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME,
I REALLY DON'T THINK

33:02.792 --> 33:04.583
THAT A SEAMLESS TRANSITION
INTO FRIENDSHIP

33:04.583 --> 33:06.291
IS IN THE CARDS
FOR US, DAWSON.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.708
I'M NOT SURE
YOU'D HAVE TIME
FOR ME ANYHOW,

33:08.708 --> 33:11.083
WHAT WITH YOUR
HECTIC DATING SCHEDULE
AND WHATNOT.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.125
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE
IF WE COULD GET OFF
THIS FERRIS WHEEL

33:16.125 --> 33:18.625
WITHOUT INSULTING EACH OTHER
ANY FURTHER.

33:18.625 --> 33:20.166
OH, AM I
INSULTING YOU, JEN?

33:20.166 --> 33:21.417
IS THAT
WHAT I'M DOING?

33:21.417 --> 33:22.750
BECAUSE THAT'S
NOT MY INTENT.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.166
MY INTENT,
SINCE WE SUDDENLY SEEM
TO HAVE THE TIME FOR IT,

33:26.166 --> 33:27.959
IS ASK FOR ONE
SMALL CLARIFICATION.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.291
AND WHAT'S THAT?

33:29.291 --> 33:30.500
OK. WHEN YOU
BROKE UP WITH ME,

33:30.500 --> 33:34.125
AMONG THE MANY QUESTIONS
THAT I ASKED YOU
WAS WHY?

33:34.125 --> 33:36.417
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

33:36.417 --> 33:38.583
AND DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR RESPONSE?

33:38.583 --> 33:40.834
YOUR VERY CONVINCING,
VERY HEARTFELT RESPONSE

33:40.834 --> 33:43.667
IS YOU NEEDED
TO BE ALONE.

33:43.667 --> 33:45.708
THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY
MEN IN YOUR LIFE

33:45.708 --> 33:48.208
AND THAT YOU NEEDED TIME
AWAY FROM THOSE MEN.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.166
DAWSON--

33:49.166 --> 33:50.667
AND CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG, JEN,

33:50.667 --> 33:52.792
BUT CLIFF ELLIOT
ISN'T EXACTLY WITH
THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY.

33:52.792 --> 33:56.250
IT'S A DATE, ALL RIGHT?

33:56.250 --> 33:58.875
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M PLANNING
OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

33:58.875 --> 33:59.875
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH?

33:59.875 --> 34:01.250
WHY DIDN'T YOU...

34:01.250 --> 34:06.000
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
WHAT I'M ONLY NOW,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.875
MUCH TO MY DISMAY
AND EMBARRASSMENT,

34:07.875 --> 34:10.041
BEGINNING TO REALIZE?

34:10.041 --> 34:11.958
THAT YOU WEREN'T
TIRED OF MEN.

34:11.958 --> 34:12.750
YOU WERE JUST
SIMPLY TIRED OF ME.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.291
HEY, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

34:16.291 --> 34:17.250
DAWSON, ALL RIGHT--

34:17.250 --> 34:20.417
OH, IT'S NOT?
PROVE ME WRONG, JEN.

34:20.417 --> 34:22.208
LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME
THAT I WAS WRONG,

34:22.208 --> 34:25.958
THAT I COMPLETELY
MISREAD THIS SITUATION.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.000
JEN, LOOK AT ME.

34:32.417 --> 34:35.750
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.958
YOU ASKED ME 2 QUESTIONS
A MINUTE AGO,

34:40.958 --> 34:42.041
AND I'D LIKE
TO ANSWER THEM.

34:42.041 --> 34:45.291
FIRST OF ALL,
WHY AM I HERE?

34:46.125 --> 34:48.917
FOR ALL
THE OBVIOUS REASONS.

34:48.917 --> 34:50.917
ALL THE CLICHÉS
ABOUT THE EX-BOYFRIEND

34:50.917 --> 34:52.542
WHO'S STILL HUNG UP
ON HIS EX,

34:52.542 --> 34:54.708
WHO DOESN'T
WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

34:54.708 --> 34:56.542
WHO CAN'T LET GO.

34:56.542 --> 34:59.583
AND WHY DID YOU
ALLOW ME TO COME?

35:02.125 --> 35:05.083
COULD IT BE,
COULD IT POSSIBLY BE

35:05.083 --> 35:07.834
THAT YOUR REASONS
ARE THE SAME AS MINE?

35:08.917 --> 35:11.333
THAT YOU NEED ME
JUST AS MUCH
AS I NEED YOU?

35:17.959 --> 35:19.583
JEN?

35:22.208 --> 35:24.166
DAWSON...

35:29.291 --> 35:30.667
OH.

35:32.166 --> 35:33.959
O-OK. JUST...

35:37.208 --> 35:41.291
JUST DON'T TELL ME
THAT I WAS WRONG.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.458
YEAH. YEAH.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.417
ANYHOW...

36:13.375 --> 36:15.625
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

36:15.625 --> 36:18.291
OH, JUST CHECKING OUT
SOME OF THE FAMED
CAPESIDE NIGHT LIFE.

36:18.291 --> 36:19.375
OHH.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.375
ACTUALLY, I NEEDED
TO TALK YOU YOU,
DAWSON.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.667
OK.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.291
IN PRIVATE.

36:26.708 --> 36:28.333
ALL RIGHT.

36:31.208 --> 36:34.583
SO HOW'D TONIGHT
GO FOR YOU?

36:34.583 --> 36:36.667
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY...
TERRIBLY.

36:36.667 --> 36:38.583
YOU?

36:38.583 --> 36:41.834
WASN'T SO BAD, ACTUALLY.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.458
UH, AND
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

36:44.458 --> 36:47.583
I GOTTA ASK
YOUR PERMISSION
FOR SOMETHING.

36:47.583 --> 36:48.417
PERMISSION?

36:48.417 --> 36:51.083
YEAH. YOU KNOW
THAT JOEY AND I

36:51.083 --> 36:53.375
HAVE NEVER PARTICULARLY
LIKED EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

36:53.375 --> 36:55.792
THAT'S WHY IT SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A BAD IDEA

36:55.792 --> 36:57.041
WHEN WE GOT STUCK TOGETHER
ON THAT MARINE BIO THING,

36:57.041 --> 36:59.875
BUT FUNNY THING IS...

36:59.875 --> 37:01.125
IT WASN'T.

37:01.125 --> 37:05.041
AND SOMEWHERE,
SOMEHOW IN THERE,

37:05.041 --> 37:07.708
I NOT ONLY STOPPED
DISLIKING HER SO MUCH,

37:07.708 --> 37:10.041
I ACTUALLY CAME
TO SORT OF LIKE HER.

37:10.041 --> 37:10.708
AS A FRIEND.

37:10.708 --> 37:13.500
AT FIRST.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.458
OK, "AT FIRST" IMPLIES
THAT YOUR FEELINGS
FOR JOEY

37:16.458 --> 37:18.500
HAVE SOMEHOW GROWN BEYOND
THE FRIENDSHIP STAGE.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.708
THAT'S GOOD.
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEANT TO IMPLY.

37:21.708 --> 37:24.708
[CHUCKLES] YOU HAVE
THE HOTS FOR JOEY?

37:24.708 --> 37:27.792
PACEY, WHAT HAVE YOU,
LIKE,

37:27.792 --> 37:30.041
BEEN INHALING TOO MANY
LAB CHEMICALS?

37:30.041 --> 37:31.291
YOU AND JOEY
ARE MORTAL ENEMIES.

37:31.291 --> 37:32.667
DO YOU MIND KEEPING
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

37:32.667 --> 37:35.959
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE
AT THIS POINT.

37:35.959 --> 37:36.667
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

37:36.667 --> 37:38.542
YEAH.

37:41.875 --> 37:42.417
OK.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.417
SO YOU LIKE JOEY.

37:45.417 --> 37:49.834
WHAT DO YOU NEED
MY PERMISSION FOR?

37:49.834 --> 37:53.083
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS,

37:53.083 --> 37:57.250
BUT I KNOW YOU TWO
HAVE THIS LONG, TORTURED
SUBTEXT TOGETHER.

37:57.250 --> 38:00.000
I JUST--I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

38:00.000 --> 38:01.708
THAT IF I WAS TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,

38:01.708 --> 38:02.750
LIKE KISS HER
OR WHATEVER,

38:02.750 --> 38:04.291
THAT I WOULDN'T BE
STEPPING ON ANY TOES.

38:04.291 --> 38:06.917
LOOK, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.333
JOEY'S MY FRIEND.

38:08.333 --> 38:11.250
I DON'T CARE
WHO SHE KISSES.

38:11.250 --> 38:13.041

SO MUCH THE BETTER.

38:15.333 --> 38:16.625
WHAT COULD BE BETTER
THAN THAT?

38:16.625 --> 38:18.834
GREAT. SO THEN YOU'RE
COOL WITH THIS, THEN?

38:18.834 --> 38:20.959
YEAH.

38:20.959 --> 38:23.208
EXCELLENT.
ALL RIGHT, DAWSON.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

38:23.208 --> 38:24.291
ALL RIGHT.

38:25.291 --> 38:26.500
NO. WAIT. I'M NOT
COOL WITH THIS.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.458
YOU'RE NOT.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.041
NO.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.583
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

38:41.917 --> 38:43.583

38:43.583 --> 38:47.458
NOTHING. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
'CAUSE I AM FINE WITH IT.

MORE FINE WITH IT. YEAH.

38:52.583 --> 38:55.166

YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.667

38:56.667 --> 38:58.417
ABSOLUTELY.

38:58.417 --> 38:59.583

ANOTHER MIDTERM,

39:33.750 --> 39:35.625
OR CAN WE DO THIS
AGAIN SOMETIME?

39:35.625 --> 39:37.625
OH, WE STILL HAVE A REPORT
TO FINISH, PACEY,

39:37.625 --> 39:40.083
SO I'M PRETTY SURE
WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

39:40.083 --> 39:44.542
ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WAS TALKING ABOUT,
JOEY?

39:44.542 --> 39:46.500
THEN WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

39:46.500 --> 39:49.959
WELL, LET ME

THIS WAY...

WAS THAT FOR?

HEH HEH. WELL, IF I HAVE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF,

39:58.875 --> 40:00.583
IT CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE
THE DESIRED EFFECT.

40:00.583 --> 40:03.166
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD--
I MEAN, I GUESS I KNOW
WHY YOU WOULD,

40:03.166 --> 40:05.875
BUT WHY WOULD YOU?

40:05.875 --> 40:09.458
WHY? 'CAUSE I REALLY
HAD A NICE TIME TODAY.

42:07.083 --> 42:08.667
HEY, FELLAS. LOOK.

42:11.959 --> 42:13.208
FIGURED YOU'D BE HERE.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.875
SO LISTEN.

42:15.875 --> 42:18.542
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE,
WHAT YOU WERE ASKING ME.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.417
I CHANGED MY MIND.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT.

42:20.417 --> 42:22.625
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO REFRESH MY MEMORY

42:22.625 --> 42:25.166
SO WE'RE ON
THE SAME PAGE HERE.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.708
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

42:26.708 --> 42:30.041
JOEY. YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO KISS JOEY?

42:30.041 --> 42:33.500
WHOO. YOU SEEM A LITTLE
WORKED UP HERE.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.166
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BREAK THIS TO YA...

42:35.166 --> 42:38.041
BREAK WHAT TO ME?

42:38.041 --> 42:40.458
WELL, YOU'RE
A LITTLE LATE.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.375
YOU KISSED HER?

42:42.375 --> 42:43.208
OH, YEAH.

42:43.208 --> 42:45.458
NOT ONLY THAT,
SHE KISSED ME BACK

42:45.458 --> 42:47.542
RIGHT THERE
IN THE FRONT SEAT

42:47.542 --> 42:48.875
OF THE WITTER
FAMILY TRUCK.

42:48.875 --> 42:50.708
PLAYED TONSIL HOCKEY
FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

42:50.708 --> 42:51.792
SHE INVITES ME IN,

42:51.792 --> 42:54.083
BUT IT WAS
A LITTLE LATE,
SO I DIDN'T.

42:54.083 --> 42:56.708
SHE'S COOKING FOR ME
TOMORROW NIGHT.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.291
SHE SAYS SHE ALWAYS
WANTED TO COOK
FOR THE RIGHT MAN.

42:58.291 --> 42:59.708
I GUESS
SHE FOUND HIM.

42:59.708 --> 43:02.542
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT
HEADING UP TO THIS

43:02.542 --> 43:05.041
COZY LITTLE B AND B
UP THE COAST.

43:05.041 --> 43:07.417
SPEND A LITTLE
QUALITY TIME
THIS WEEKEND.

43:08.083 --> 43:09.250
YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT.

43:09.250 --> 43:12.166
YES, I AM.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.750
AND SO ARE YOU.

43:14.750 --> 43:18.583
YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME
YOU STARTED
ASKING YOURSELF

43:18.583 --> 43:20.417
SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS,
DAWSON.

43:20.417 --> 43:23.083
'CAUSE YOU EXHAUST
WAY TOO MUCH TIME
AND ENERGY

43:23.083 --> 43:23.625
ON A GIRL YOU CALL
YOUR FRIEND.

43:23.625 --> 43:26.458
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

43:26.458 --> 43:28.500
LET'S JUST SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT HERE.
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

43:28.500 --> 43:30.542
IS IT JEN, OR IS IT JOEY?

43:30.542 --> 43:32.542
DO YOU LIKE THE BLONDE,
OR DO YOU LIKE THE BRUNETTE?

43:33.667 --> 43:36.750
THESE QUESTIONS ARE NOT
GONNA GO AWAY, DAWSON.

43:36.750 --> 43:37.750
IT'S TIME THAT YOU
PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS.
