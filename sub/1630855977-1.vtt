How is everybody doing tonight?

52:52.620 --> 52:57.210
Are you guys enjoying the
hospitality of my town?

52:57.210 --> 52:59.965
I don't know about
you guys, but I'm

52:59.965 --> 53:01.590
going to have a real
good time tonight.

53:01.590 --> 53:03.517
Yes.

53:03.517 --> 53:05.850
Hey, you know, Luke had his
first encounter with a ghost

53:05.850 --> 53:06.840
last night.

53:06.840 --> 53:07.860
Ghost?

53:07.860 --> 53:08.520
Oh, my God.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.630
Really?

53:09.630 --> 53:10.650
Oh, that's good.

53:10.650 --> 53:12.190
He's the lucky one.

53:12.190 --> 53:14.130
I got lucky all right.

53:14.130 --> 53:15.900
I mean, that house is
like really haunted.

53:15.900 --> 53:18.442
So I mean, you can put that down
on your list and everything.

53:18.442 --> 53:21.240
Oh, [LAUGHS] Redbeard's
house of horrors?

53:21.240 --> 53:22.920
I already do.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.600
What about you, Harvey?

53:24.600 --> 53:27.870
I guess I saw people
making out with ghosts.

53:27.870 --> 53:29.850
What?

53:29.850 --> 53:32.100
Just messing with you.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.630
Drink up.

53:33.630 --> 53:35.340
Come on, Harvey.

53:35.340 --> 53:36.720
He's only 20.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.820
Nothing wrong with a drink.

53:38.820 --> 53:39.630
Leave my boy alone.

53:52.780 --> 53:55.880
Nita, I'm really sorry.

53:55.880 --> 53:58.060
OK, let's just forget about it.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.070
Did you really see a ghost?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.790
Yeah.

54:01.790 --> 54:04.436
Yeah, really saw one.

54:04.436 --> 54:06.400
And it was so real.

54:21.250 --> 54:24.560
Thanks for your support, David.

54:24.560 --> 54:28.310
I really appreciate it.

54:28.310 --> 54:32.270
This is my first big story.

54:32.270 --> 54:35.300

54:35.300 --> 54:39.920

Talako and shit.

It was horrible, what the
Pirates and settlers did here.

54:45.770 --> 54:47.720
There's something more.

54:47.720 --> 54:51.320
Talako was deeply loved
by his people and by--

54:51.320 --> 54:52.460
Should I be jealous?

for listening to me

Did you-- did you hear that?

56:04.050 --> 56:05.820
What was that?

56:05.820 --> 56:10.230
I heard many, many people
died here, probably.

56:10.230 --> 56:13.620
Including the
merciless Redbeard.

56:13.620 --> 56:16.680
And Talako was burned
alive in these woods.

56:19.420 --> 56:22.780
Isn't that why we're
staying here, Lara?

56:22.780 --> 56:24.730
Yes.

56:24.730 --> 56:28.402
Many natives and slave
were tortured in this town.

their loved ones.

feast of the dead, [INAUDIBLE]

No one.

could all be together and hang

59:07.770 --> 59:11.950
out and be off our phones.

59:11.950 --> 59:12.450

I just felt like this
cold hand over my mouth.

59:52.470 --> 59:53.730
It was suffocating me.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.720
I am nothing more
than a position

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.020
to Redbeard, a
privateers bathing.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:26.170
He will never let me go
just as he will never

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.890
relinquish his grip on
the land he has stolen.

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:35.310
He is striving to own all he
sees, control all he touches.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:39.250
I was a fool not really
that easy bargains are never

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:41.620

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.910
Even in death, I fear he
will never release my soul,

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.655
and I shall return
for more torment.

I'm not afraid of you.

Look what you're
doing to yourself.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.510
Is your precious Talako
worth all of this?

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.940
What if Talako and
other restless souls

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:09.900
are actually trying to
communicate with us?

have a caretaker.

about reincarnation.

we are not alone.

evidence out there.

What kind of objective
evidence do you have?
